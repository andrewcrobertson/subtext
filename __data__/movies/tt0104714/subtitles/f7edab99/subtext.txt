41 41 25.000
4963 9426 Easy, let's not kill him, yet.<br />Let's see who he is first, all right?
11553 13555 You have the right to remain silent.
13638 15390 Shut him up!
15807 17892 Sergeant Martin Riggs.
20395 22272 - Get the truck ready.<br />- Right.
22355 23898 So, Sergeant Riggs...
24315 25942 How did you find us?
26067 27819 Freeze! Police!
28862 30405 Another one?
30697 32532 We need a new fucking dog.
32615 34492 Get your hands up, asshole.
34784 36119 Get them up!
39914 41124 A little bit higher.
41207 42500 That's better.
43918 45295 Very good.
49507 50759 Drop it, miss.
53136 54262 Now, look!
105146 107065 Okay, I'm on! No, I'm not!
107399 108274 Wait!
108650 110276 Wait, wait!
113738 115323 Sergeant Cole!
115407 117158 Get down! Get down!
121162 123331 Get those cases and kill that dog!
135385 136469 Stop!
137220 141266 - The dog. Where'd you learn to fight?<br />- Catholic school. Forget the dog.
141349 143435 Here, boy! We're waiting for him.
143518 144978 Hold it, hold it.
145061 146104 Hurry.
146271 148732 Good dog. Good puppy. Go!
151317 152485 Stop!
153153 154571 - What?<br />- Guns.
154654 155780 - It's full of guns.<br />- Grab one.
155864 157741 - You grab one.<br />- Chicken.
157824 159075 Step on it.
163204 165707 Get that crate! Come on!
171421 176092 Hatchett, you said not to worry about<br />the police, but the cops are all over you!
176259 179012 They got my guns.<br />They'll come after me, next!
179095 181222 As far as I'm concerned, the deal's off!
181306 184601 Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone.<br />We have a deal.
184851 186269 Nobody backs out.
186478 188646 You said you had the cops under control.
188730 190899 I see that isn't so. Give me one reason...
190982 192609 ...to do business with you.
192692 194402 I'll give you a good reason.
194486 196738 Tyrone, this is Travis.
196905 201409 You back out now, and I'll make sure<br />only your dentist can identify the body.
201534 204120 Is that a good enough reason for you?
206456 208166 But I need ammo!
208333 210543 I'm out of business without ammo!
210627 211961 I need the good stuff.
212045 214464 You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
216049 217801 "The good stuff." Jesus.
217842 220261 Time to pay another visit to the LAPD.
222389 224432 You look like I feel.
238363 240740 You got anything I can put on my head?
240824 242367 The hat in the closet.
242450 246621 You're all heart. Here I thought<br />you'd get all tender and maternal.
247497 249749 I was raised with four brothers.
249916 254796 We got hurt often, but if no bones were<br />broken or blood gushed, nobody cared.
254879 256423 Look, blood. See? Blood.
256506 258049 It's not gushing.
258216 260135 It was free falling earlier.
261011 265890 Could you bring me a needle and thread?<br />Some peroxide. I'll patch it up myself.
268893 270437 Don't touch anything.
270645 272022 I wasn't.
273815 275608 What's with you?
293084 294711 What are you doing?
295170 297630 - I said don't touch anything.<br />- It came on by itself.
297714 299966 All by itself. You a wiseguy?
300133 302302 You don't like to share your toys?
302385 304387 - This isn't a toy.<br />- What is it?
304429 306306 - This is a weapon.<br />- A weapon?
306514 309017 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
309059 311102 What, you throw it at people?
311227 314230 You'll give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
314314 315440 Right here.
315565 318443 - Take a little off the top.<br />- Right here.
324199 326743 You bring all your interrogations home?
326826 329287 - What are we talking about?<br />- It's back here.
329371 331122 - Careful, careful.<br />- Turn your head.
331206 332749 - Careful.<br />- This?
332874 335627 - This scratch?<br />- It feels like the Grand Canyon.
335669 336961 Oh, God.
337712 339005 Hold still.
340256 342759 Oh, God. We haven't even started.
343802 345428 Be gentle with me.
345887 349516 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
349724 352811 That's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
353103 355772 - That's a natural mistake.<br />- What, I have a wooden head?
355855 357315 - Look at this.<br />- A knife.
357399 359275 Knife. That's very nice.
360026 361027 This is all right.
361111 363655 That's pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw.
363863 366825 That's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this.
367158 369369 Same thing. Third and Highland.
369452 372455 - Dragged for about half a block.<br />- That's a good one.
372539 374916 Feel that texture. Cheese-grater time.
375000 377002 - Moving truck.<br />- Moving truck?
377293 378253 Moving bullet.
378336 380922 - Moving bullet?<br />- Here. This is the best.
382257 384759 - It goes all the way to the back.<br />- Right through?!
384843 386678 You're lucky. Was it a.22?
386761 388138 It's a.38.
388513 391474 - It's a.38.<br />- That? That's wimpy. This is a.38.
391599 394227 Yours is bigger than mine?<br />I don't think so.
394811 396271 Maybe not, but look.
396312 399733 A whole family of.44s on the back.
399816 401026 There they are.
401109 401985 Impressive.
402068 405613 One hit my lung. I was breathing<br />blood bubbles. Disgusting.
405780 407198 Blood bubbles. Okay.
407240 408491 You got one?
409451 411286 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
413538 415915 Right down here. Went through.
416416 417876 - That must have hurt.<br />- Right.
417917 419002 Not too close.
419085 421212 Riggs, if he were that close,<br />I'd be dead.
421296 423465 I can beat it. I can beat it.
424507 426801 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- You gotta see this.
426885 428553 - I believe you.<br />- This guy had a knife.
428636 432766 You'll love it. He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
433725 435977 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- Look!
436144 437354 No, I said forget it.
437437 439105 This is a blue-ribbon event.
439189 440523 Forget it.
441649 442776 You started this.
442859 445737 - Yeah, I can end it.<br />- You know what?
446154 447989 You're a very poor loser.
449115 450408 I didn't lose.
450658 452452 - Yes, you did.<br />- No, I didn't lose.
452535 454245 - You lost.<br />- I conceded.
454329 456873 No, I conceded. There's a difference<br />between losing and conceding.
456956 459084 You conceded or you're conceited?
459167 461127 You think I'm conceited?
461378 463630 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
463713 464964 I'll get a Band-Aid.
465048 468051 - Tell me you lost.<br />- I said, don't touch anything.
480522 483358 You're going to smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
484067 486111 I can do better than that.
503920 506798 This could be<br />a serious ethical breach here.
507716 511219 - I never made it with another sergeant.<br />- Shut up, Riggs.
572739 574699 Oh, damn Riggs.
577327 578286 What do you want?
578370 580914 Just wanted to see how you were doing.
581081 582999 Who sent you? Trish?
583583 585627 You drink pretty well.<br />Trish didn't send me.
585710 588046 Rianne came to see me.
588296 589714 To your place?
589756 591174 Well, that's where I am.
591216 594928 - My daughter came to your trailer.<br />- Yeah.
595679 600308 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Come on, she was worried.
600392 602310 Get off of my boat, Riggs!
602435 604437 - Come on.<br />- Get off my boat!
604521 606106 You're drunk.
606231 608566 That's something you should know about.
608650 611528 - This isn't going to do you any good.<br />- Give me that.
611569 612737 Give me that.
612821 614823 Roger, please don't do this.
615156 618284 You got three days until you retire.<br />This won't do you any good.
618368 620912 You self-righteous bastard! Give it!
621371 623289 Don't do this, okay? Please.
623373 625375 Give it to me, damn it.
626042 628628 What are you going to do now, shoot me?
629963 631089 There.
631172 633591 Take your finger out of my bottle.<br />Give me that gun.
633675 635510 The bottle's going sailing.
636553 638179 Son of a bitch!
643059 644644 Not bad for an old man.
644728 645770 You finished?
645854 648481 No, I got another bottle in the galley<br />and I'll get it.
648565 650108 No, you're not.
650233 652444 Don't do this to yourself!
652527 654279 You gotta cut this.
655613 657866 Oh, man, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
658366 660160 Come on. Sit down.
662162 663997 - You hit me.<br />- Cool it, will you?
664039 666082 Cut it out. Give it up, okay?
666124 667334 Go ahead.
667459 669461 Go ahead. Hit me again.
669627 671963 I don't want to hit you!<br />You think I like this shit?
672005 674966 Hit me again. You think I'm afraid of you?
675258 677844 - I know you're not.<br />- Of that kung fu shit?
678053 679679 Please, Rog.
680597 682724 That kid was a killer, all right.
682807 684225 That wasn't a toy in his hand.
684309 687812 That was a machine pistol<br />with twin carbines and trimmings.
688063 689189 He would have drilled you...
689272 691775 ...me, anybody that came along.
691941 693526 You had no choice.
693902 696321 It didn't happen to you.<br />It happened to me.
696404 697864 It happened to me!
698031 700325 My God, I killed that kid!
700492 701993 I killed that boy.
702035 704079 You kill a lot of people.
704245 707832 You kill a fucking lot of people!<br />You don't kill a baby!
707999 711378 You got ice in your veins.<br />You don't kill a boy like Nick.
711503 713213 You selfish bastard!
713296 714798 You selfish bastard!
715256 717717 You're just thinking about yourself.
717884 719260 What about me?
719969 722389 We're partners! We are partners.
723390 725225 What happens to you, happens to me.
725308 728603 After all the shit we've been through,<br />don't you get it?!
728853 730230 Don't you get it?
731189 734943 When you retire, you're not just<br />retiring you, you're retiring us.
735026 737028 - You're retiring us.<br />- That's not my problem.
737070 738196 Yes, it is.
738279 741282 - It's not my problem!<br />- You're the only family I've got!
741366 744160 I got three beautiful kids.<br />I love them and they're yours!
744244 747664 Trish does my laundry.<br />I live in your icebox. I live in your life!
747747 749791 What am I going to do?
750041 751584 - I don't care.<br />- Yes, you do!
751668 753128 - I don't care.<br />- Yes, you do!
753169 754754 I don't care!
754838 755880 You do!
756089 758174 - I don't care!<br />- You do!
758216 759843 I don't care!
759926 762512 I don't care! I don't care!
765140 769185 I don't know what I'm saying anymore.<br />I don't know what I'm thinking.
769978 772355 I had three days, and now this.
774065 775191 I'm sorry.
775483 778028 - That's all right.<br />- No, I'm really sorry.
779863 781406 I didn't realize...
781489 783658 ...that my retirement<br />is gonna screw you up.
783742 787912 Forget it. I haven't got any problem.<br />I was out of line saying that shit.
788496 789831 Look, man...
791291 792667 Riggs, look...
793877 795545 You know I love you.
796671 800967 You know I love you, Riggs.<br />And your problems are my problems.
802427 805013 Like you said, what happens to you...
805555 807724 ...happens to me. So try me.
808099 809559 I'm here for you.
810226 812729 I haven't got any problems.
813188 817067 Yes, you do. We all have problems.<br />You help me...
817609 819402 ...and I'm gonna help you.
822405 824616 I do have a little problem.
826201 828870 You don't want to hear.<br />This is piddly shit.
829162 831122 Yes, I do. I want to hear it.
831206 833249 - Tell me.<br />- This is ridiculous.
833458 836419 - You don't want to hear it.<br />- I'm here. I'm here.
836670 837921 Well...
838880 843051 I think maybe I slept with someone<br />that I probably shouldn't have.
845053 846596 You son of a bitch!
854104 855271 Help me.
855355 857857 I ought to let you drown, traitor.
857899 858942 Help me.
859275 860860 Come on in.
865198 866700 What did you hit me for?
866741 868785 'Cause you slept with Rianne.
870328 871454 I did not.
871538 874749 - Who did you sleep with?<br />- I slept with Sergeant Cole.
875250 877002 Sergeant Cole from Traffic?
877085 879421 No, not Sergeant Cole from Traffic.
880588 882632 Lorna. Sergeant Cole from Traffic's<br />her uncle.
882674 885552 - Okay. That's okay.<br />- Oh, I don't know.
888304 889681 Sheriff's Department.
889764 890807 Sheriff...
890890 892434 We're LAPD.
893685 896021 What are you boys doing down there?
896563 899149 - We're in the middle of a case.<br />- Yeah.
899315 900525 Of Scotch.
902861 904612 Let's get out of here.
920420 922255 Go with the grain.
925842 927594 I'll show you. Here.
930096 932182 You're going against the grain.
937062 938563 - Like that.<br />- Okay.
945945 947155 You okay?
950575 952702 Darryl was my friend, Dad.
954496 956831 I know. I'm sorry, son.
958083 960126 I hope you don't blame me.
961586 963338 I don't blame you, Dad.
964422 965924 I blame Darryl.
970387 972055 What's this right here?
978561 980188 I love you, Dad.
983358 985235 I love you, son.
1006631 1010385 May he find the peace in heaven<br />that eluded him on earth.
1010593 1012512 And may the scourge of violence...
1012595 1016391 ...claiming the lives of our children<br />be lifted by Your grace...
1016474 1018184 ...and infinite wisdom.
1019102 1020311 Amen.
1049632 1050842 Wait here.
1057140 1058641 Mrs. Smithers.
1058725 1059851 Ma'am?
1063521 1065190 I just don't know...
1072072 1074657 You want to do something,<br />Sergeant Murtaugh?
1074783 1076326 You find the man...
1076409 1078787 ...that put the gun in my son's hand.
1097889 1099724 Take your mama to the car.
1104938 1106022 You okay?
1106898 1107941 Yeah.
1108817 1110318 Who's got the gun?
1112237 1114030 - You got it.<br />- Yeah.
1121621 1125208 - Where did this gun come from?<br />- Fuck you!
1126334 1130171 Ever heard of the word "genocide"?<br />Have you, stupid motherfucker?
1130296 1131965 Ever heard of genocide?
1132048 1134134 You fools are killing yourselves!<br />You're killing us!
1134175 1136386 I'm tired of it! I'm tired of it!<br />Motherfucker!
1136469 1140223 You better tell me where this come from<br />or I'll blow your head off!
1140265 1143018 I want to know, now!<br />Where did it come from?
1149733 1153445 You see this gun? I want to know<br />where it came from! Now!
1156281 1158533 We're looking for your friend, Travis.
1158616 1160368 I never heard of him.
1160869 1162370 Wrong answer.
1162537 1164706 And you're pulling the wrong string.
1164789 1166791 That's not a very professional attitude.
1166875 1168126 Who the fuck are you guys?
1168209 1171463 Sorry! LAPD. We're just doing<br />a few routine inquiries.
1171546 1173923 You been checked for lumps recently?
1174549 1175759 Give me my fucking wallet!
1175842 1177635 Keep your hands down!
1177719 1178803 My fucking wallet!
1178928 1181139 Get up. We don't need this!
1182807 1187395 We have a license that belongs to<br />Hubert Bartholomew Smith. Nice picture.
1187479 1188355 Fuck you.
1188438 1190190 Hey, there's a lady here.
1192609 1194611 What the hell's going on here?
1195904 1197864 - Maybe they know something.<br />- I'll go see.
1197947 1200867 - Want me to come with you?<br />- No, I got it.
1203411 1204537 I should go with her.
1204621 1208166 No, I want you to see something.<br />She has a gift. Watch this.
1208708 1210251 Good morning, gentlemen.
1210335 1212671 LAPD. Got a few questions.
1212754 1213922 You on parole?
1214005 1216549 - I got a job!<br />- Who asked you?!
1217050 1219010 Any of you know a Mr. Travis?
1219135 1220637 You got a warrant?
1220804 1222472 No, but I can get one.
1222555 1223890 Until you do...
1224140 1225392 ...fuck off.
1225600 1228019 That's not a nice thing to say to a lady.
1228103 1229604 Fuck you.
1229771 1231231 I don't think so.
1234818 1236111 Backspin kick.
1246204 1247664 You okay, honey?
1247706 1248915 Just great.
1255755 1257716 - Honey?<br />- How are you doing?
1257757 1259384 This guy's on parole.
1259634 1261511 This guy's an asshole!
1261720 1264139 - Riggs, there's five of them!<br />- I know.
1266558 1267851 Look at that.
1276568 1278111 Grabbed his clusters!
1280405 1281781 Let me help her.
1282490 1283616 Stay still.
1297339 1298548 My girl.
1300800 1303178 This PMS... is murder.
1304763 1306306 I know what you mean.
1306389 1308516 I've been married 25 years.
1309267 1311061 So, tell me about Travis.
1311519 1314606 I told you before, moron,<br />I don't know Jack Travis.
1314689 1316316 I didn't say his name was Jack.
1316399 1318818 You better start telling me<br />more than jackshit.
1318902 1320028 Come on.
1322572 1326326 - Men cross the street when they see me.<br />- I didn't have enough time.
1326368 1329954 I'm not your enemy, captain.<br />I'm just trying to do my job.
1330497 1333625 - Have you eaten?<br />- I already ate. I gotta go downtown.
1333750 1335960 - What, you eat alone?<br />- I'm used to it.
1336044 1337337 It's bad for the digestion.
1337420 1340423 Tomorrow you have lunch with me<br />but I'm not paying.
1347764 1349349 You all right?
1350225 1352060 Two fingers, Murph.
1353353 1357107 - Jack, what the fuck?<br />- Get in the car. I'll tell you on the way.
1363947 1366741 After watching Lorna<br />handle herself so well...
1367033 1369536 ...I'm changing my mind about Kung Fu.
1369577 1371246 Want to try some of it?
1371705 1373540 - No.<br />- Come on.
1373623 1376126 You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
1376376 1377836 Old dog, my ass.
1378753 1382549 Let me try something. Watch this.<br />It's called a backspin kick.
1382966 1384801 Pivot on the right, kick with your left...
1384884 1388221 ...and you whip that head around<br />to catch the target over there.
1388304 1390515 Like this. Follow through.
1390557 1392642 Like so. So, you whip the head.
1395103 1396229 All right?
1396855 1399190 Thank you. Now you try it.
1400066 1402152 Here's your target. All right?
1402235 1406573 Remember, pivot right, kick left,<br />turn the head, spot the target.
1406740 1409451 - Like that.<br />- Yeah. Follow the head around.
1409617 1412328 Back up a bit. We don't want you<br />to bump into the pole.
1412412 1415290 Just back up a little bit.<br />A little bit more. Okay, good.
1415373 1417625 Mind and body strong, now, grasshopper.
1417709 1418835 All right.
1419711 1420754 Go.
1428887 1430347 He can't hold his water.
1430430 1432015 Get back to work!
1432432 1434517 Okay, back to work everybody.
1434684 1437354 Oh, Rog, I'm sorry.
1440940 1445820 You could be experiencing some<br />transitional anger caused by the shooting.
1446613 1448490 You want to talk about it?
1449491 1452035 - He's okay for a change.<br />- Are you sure?
1452535 1455747 You look good in red. That's your color.
1456331 1459959 - I've got a little extra time now.<br />- I'm fine.
1465757 1466883 Oh, shit!
1467133 1469010 Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?
1469302 1470345 What?
1472180 1475558 Can you tell me where I can find<br />good-Iooking Murtaugh?
1476685 1478228 Hi, skinny!
1478520 1480897 - Dolores. Remember me?<br />- I remember you.
1480980 1484275 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
1484359 1488154 Actually, he's cowering down<br />on all fours right behind this counter.
1491074 1494035 - Where is the sergeant?<br />- He's not here right now.
1494452 1497163 But he's talked of nothing<br />but you all week.
1497247 1499457 - Shut my mouth.<br />- The man's on fire.
1499582 1502335 - What's the matter, baby?<br />- A little sciatica.
1502419 1505213 You tell him Delores was here.
1505338 1507173 You tell that man...
1507257 1509801 ...that he's the jam in my jellyroll.
1510677 1513054 I'll see you, baby, okay. Bye-bye.
1514014 1515056 See you.
1516850 1519644 Dolores says you're the jam in her jellyroll.
1520020 1521563 I heard.
1522022 1523857 That's a lot of woman.
1524190 1528194 She calls me all the time. She leaves me<br />notes. What am I going to do?
1528278 1529988 You shouldn't have led her on.
1530071 1532615 Led her on? I didn't do anything.
1536578 1539247 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
1539456 1541583 You've got to come see me.
1542459 1544961 We got to work. Come on. Let's go.
1545211 1548006 - Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />- Thanks ma'am.
1548298 1549591 - You're a beauty.<br />- Coming?
1549674 1551301 A beauty. I'm coming.
1559517 1561269 Good afternoon, Captain.
1563396 1565982 That's good. See how easy that was?
1570570 1572655 I love it down here. Don't you?
1572697 1576451 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
1581122 1582999 Give me the lock-up keys.
1583583 1586503 These guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
1586544 1591007 They were all busted by the same<br />police officer, Jack Edward Travis.
1591174 1593718 Early paroles on a work furlough program.
1593802 1596930 Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
1597347 1600100 You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
1600308 1602227 - May I see your pass?<br />- My pass?
1602310 1603520 Here's my pass.
1603561 1606398 - I got shot in the line of duty.<br />- He's with us.
1606564 1608316 - He's with us?<br />- I said that?
1608400 1610193 Where'd you get her from?
1610402 1611820 Why aren't you in the hospital?
1611903 1613279 Don't mention it.
1613363 1615657 I told you not to leave me there.<br />They tried to take my appendix out.
1615740 1617409 They gave me a lapotomy.
1617492 1619619 - Brain surgery?<br />- A lapotomy.
1619786 1622288 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
1622372 1623540 What's the difference?
1623623 1627711 The difference is, for a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
1627877 1629087 Nether what?
1629587 1631631 Nether...<br />I can't say it in front of her.
1631715 1633008 Point to it.
1634342 1635760 - Here.<br />- Must be itchy.
1635802 1638555 It is itchy. These doctors are savages.
1638680 1642392 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
1644853 1647731 Yeah. With a telescope<br />big enough to see Venus.
1647814 1649524 I guess all he saw was Uranus.
1649607 1652193 That's great. Thank you.
1652235 1653778 You know what I say?
1653862 1657782 They fuck you in the hospital.<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you!
1657824 1659325 When they're done...
1659409 1662662 ...the insurance company comes<br />and fucks you some more!
1662829 1666249 $10 for a fucking aspirin<br />and it isn't even covered!
1666374 1667584 That's enough!
1667667 1669377 We're trying to work here.
1669461 1672422 So, what's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
1672505 1674174 Did you guys advertise?
1674257 1676676 - He's family.<br />- Who's she?
1677135 1679095 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- How are you? Leo Getz.
1679763 1681514 Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?
1681598 1683641 - I get it.<br />- It's real estate, now...
1683725 1686311 Listen, come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
1686436 1688813 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
1688897 1690648 You can get us a cup of coffee.
1690732 1694402 That's great. I take one for you<br />and that's what you tell me?
1694736 1697822 - He could check this.<br />- That's all I'm good for?
1699282 1700825 We got something for you to do.
1700867 1704996 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
1705914 1707916 - Sure, I can do this.<br />- Remember that name?
1707999 1709626 Mesa Verde, I got it.
1709834 1712128 Wait, wait. What are you doing?
1712170 1714172 If there's any shit there, he'll find it.
1714255 1716299 - Who is that guy?<br />- It's a long story.
1723098 1725100 Here are your keys, Captain.
1725684 1726810 You motherfucker!
1726893 1728520 - Don't be stupid.<br />- What the fuck?
1728603 1732857 Take the elevator, get the other guys.<br />Keys. Give me them fucking hands.
1733775 1736319 Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.
1737987 1739989 Stand there.
1744077 1746454 I'm faster than that real estate broker.
1746996 1749582 Leo's not just a real estate broker.
1749708 1752669 He's a pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
1753795 1757549 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator.
1757841 1759801 - How'd you know where to find them?<br />- We got it all.
1759884 1762220 World of computers.
1762345 1765473 You used to be one of us, for Christ's sake.
1765682 1768601 You know what future a cop has? None.
1769227 1772272 Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
1772564 1773898 Pension.
1774441 1775567 Nothing to do.
1775650 1779279 Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain<br />by evening. Not for this kid.
1779362 1781656 Police Department's got it all.
1781781 1783783 Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.
1783867 1786870 It's a one-stop shopping center<br />if you know how.
1787078 1788913 Not a thing anybody can do about it.
1788955 1791583 You're already fucking history<br />and you know it.
1791666 1794377 Sorry. I'm just getting started.
1794878 1796713 Something's wrong here.
1797088 1799758 The program's been accessed<br />by somebody from outside.
1799841 1801551 What's been accessed?
1801760 1805305 After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs<br />moved the confiscated ammunition.
1805347 1806389 Armor-piercing bullets?
1806473 1809267 Thousands of rounds<br />to a more secured location.
1810894 1812937 - That's what's been accessed.<br />- Someone else knows.
1813021 1816024 Where's this store? Where'd they move it?
1816441 1817859 Let's go.
1818485 1821946 - I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.<br />- That's a switch.
1822113 1823865 - In the building.<br />- Where?
1823948 1825241 - I'm showing you.<br />- Something going down?
1825325 1827744 - Nothing's going down.<br />- I'm going with you.
1827786 1830705 - How old are you?<br />- Twenty-two today.
1830789 1831831 Come on.
1831998 1833583 You got protection?
1833667 1836628 - Right here in my wallet.<br />- No, your vest, you dummy!
1836711 1837921 Should we take him?
1838004 1841424 - Okay, but keep your head down.<br />- Stay behind me.
1841633 1843551 Come on, let's go. Quiet!
1856731 1858608 You were my ticket in.
1858983 1861569 It's too bad you won't be coming with me.
1867200 1868702 They got it all.
1870161 1872706 - He's dead.<br />- How'd they get it out of here?
1872789 1874916 - I don't know.<br />- Not upstairs.
1875208 1876626 Elevator!
1879838 1881423 Shit. It's down.
1881548 1883008 The subway's down there.
1883091 1884843 - Let's take the stairs.<br />- LA has subways?
1884926 1888013 - Where you been?<br />- Read something besides the comics.
1889264 1891516 All right. Come on, let's hustle!
1894227 1895770 Hurry up, guys.
1909451 1910994 LAPD! Come here!
1911077 1913246 Come here! Step on it!
1913788 1915498 Son of a bitch.
1915582 1917375 You see anybody, anything strange?
1917459 1921546 - Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.<br />- Split now. Just get out of here.
1922922 1924841 - I'm going across.<br />- I got it.
1931848 1933933 Get rid of Murphy, now!
1939814 1942817 Where the fuck do you think you're going?<br />Let's go.
1954996 1956623 Let's get out of here!
1958291 1959459 Cover me!
1980897 1982065 Let's go!
1992909 1994452 Stay still.
2004838 2006464 Happy birthday, kid.
2033867 2035285 Another baby.
2048757 2050592 Is he dead? Check the body.
2050675 2052135 Get me out of here!
2056931 2058600 Stupid son of a bitch!
2071071 2072155 Stop that!
2072238 2073323 Cut it out!
2073406 2075075 - Don't shoot!<br />- LAPD!
2075533 2076618 Where does this lead?
2076701 2078453 - Pico Station.<br />- Thanks.
2078536 2079746 Not that way.
2079829 2082665 Take the stairs, it's faster.
2096429 2097639 Gangway!
2105814 2107732 Get out of the way!
2110819 2111945 Holy shit!
2112529 2113863 Son of a bitch!
2114447 2115740 Police!
2122956 2124958 Step on it! There he is!
2126876 2128086 Goddamn!
2133425 2135552 Put your foot down!
2163329 2164456 Police!
2165248 2166332 I need your bike.
2166416 2167917 This is bullshit!
2168168 2171713 Sergeant Riggs, call it in.<br />I need a couple of clips, too.
2187896 2189606 Okay, we lost him.
2197155 2199240 Where's Riggs?
2199866 2202660 Keep me in touch<br />with the motorcycle pursuit.
2209834 2211670 - Shit!<br />- Take a right, now.
2211836 2213254 Take a right! Go!
2214047 2215382 Go! Go! Go!
2216966 2219010 Take a right! No, left!
2261970 2264347 This is 6-William-6, this is 6-William-6.
2264431 2266266 I'm at the freeway construction site.
2266349 2268560 Where's Riggs? I'm here.<br />Where's he?
2268643 2270437 Come back to me, Central.
2271354 2273189 Where the hell is Riggs?
2274733 2276234 Take a left here! Get off!
2276317 2277861 Get off the freeway.
2290206 2291541 Stop! Hold it!
2293168 2294336 Shit!
2295211 2296254 Hang on!
2312354 2314064 Where is the pursuit?
2318151 2319194 Shit!
2332874 2333875 Riggs!
2334501 2335669 Relax, Riggs.
2335752 2336544 Relax?!
2341800 2343009 Shit!
2354979 2355980 Riggs.
2358483 2360860 Just get back! Get back!
2361361 2363029 Riggs, talk to me.
2364155 2365824 Riggs, you're alive.
2367033 2368785 Don't move. Don't move!
2368868 2370412 Just get back!
2371121 2372497 You all right?
2379963 2381297 Don't touch me!
2381381 2384092 Okay, okay! I'm not touching you!
2385135 2387053 Don't touch me! Don't!
2392434 2395020 - Don't touch me!<br />- I won't touch you!
2399649 2402986 - You okay now?<br />- I'm pissed now. Now I'm pissed.
2403069 2404529 - Now what?<br />- That bastard!
2404612 2406906 He's done it twice now. Damn!
2407032 2410035 Son of a gun, I'll suck his eyes<br />through his nose.
2410326 2413663 Twice he got away.<br />Nobody gets away from me.
2413997 2415749 Just relax.
2415999 2418001 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
2418084 2420170 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm okay.
2425508 2427218 - I'm having that!<br />- You quit!
2427302 2430263 I ran out of biscuits, okay?<br />Give me a break.
2431348 2432849 Oh, shit!
2434100 2435226 Oh, shit.
2439939 2440940 Perfect.
2442525 2444527 What'd I miss? What'd I miss?
2445153 2447489 - What are you doing here?<br />- Great car chase.
2447572 2449574 - Great chase!<br />- What are you doing here?
2449616 2451701 - How'd you find us?<br />- Police scanner.
2451743 2454371 What are you doing<br />with a police scanner?!
2455080 2458792 Hello, Car 54, where are you?<br />I cracked this case for you guys.
2458958 2461127 Listen! Mesa Verde's legit.
2461336 2463922 They got a housing project,<br />called Rancho Arroyo.
2464047 2466633 - I know where that is!<br />- Why don't we check it out?
2466675 2468468 - Good idea.<br />- Let's do that.
2468551 2469719 I'll come with you.
2469803 2472681 - You're not coming.<br />- Yes, I am. I'll take my car.
2472722 2474516 - No, you're not.<br />- Yes, I am.
2476476 2479312 I can't believe you did that!<br />I got a spare!
2482774 2484442 - You're driving!<br />- No, I'm driving!
2484526 2487237 How could you do that?!<br />I can't believe you did that!
2487320 2488738 I can't believe you did it!
2488822 2490240 Where's Lorna?
2490532 2492617 I can't believe you did that!
2495245 2496621 I can't believe it.
2496663 2498707 How could you do that to me?!
2500208 2501251 Did you see that?
2501334 2504295 They're my partners.<br />I can't believe they did that!
2505171 2506798 Do you own your home?
2541958 2544711 - Looks like we came to the right place.<br />- Yeah.
2544878 2546963 Move on out to Travis Town.
2547172 2549341 Great place to raise a family.
2549883 2552135 Built on guns and bloodshed.
2552302 2554971 One hell of a retirement plan<br />this asshole's got.
2555055 2557766 Let's foreclose on this bastard.
2558391 2561061 - Say, is that...<br />- Darryl's gun.
2561311 2564147 - I was saving it for the right occasion.<br />- This is it.
2564189 2566441 - How many men do you think he has?<br />- Who knows?
2566524 2568735 Maybe I should run over there<br />and ask him?
2568902 2570528 That'd be too easy.
2570820 2573156 We need grenades or a rocket launcher.
2573239 2575325 Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
2575867 2578453 Wonder what Murphy's got in his trunk.
2580538 2583208 It's obvious, Murphy was<br />never a Boy Scout.
2583625 2585752 Not even a good spare.
2589547 2592133 Put your hands down. It's embarrassing.
2594803 2596137 How you doing?
2596221 2597263 Kissing.
2597347 2598556 Fresh ones?
2598890 2600850 Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.
2600892 2602519 No points for those.
2602560 2604562 - How'd you get here?<br />- Drove.
2605647 2609025 I ran into Leo at the police station.<br />He talked to me first.
2609275 2611861 - Any ideas?<br />- Lucky thing we got a plan.
2612153 2613446 Lucky thing. What is it?
2613530 2615365 I want it to be a surprise.
2616199 2617867 I like surprises.
2623623 2625000 Move it!
2627460 2629421 - Check it out.<br />- Let's go.
2647689 2650400 - Look at Murph's car.<br />- It could've been worse.
2650483 2653778 - It could've been yours.<br />- Worse, it could've been Trish's car.
2654946 2656072 - On three.<br />- Three.
2656156 2657449 Three?
2658950 2660160 One...
2661327 2662579 ...two...<br />- Three!
2662662 2664039 Police! Freeze!
2665790 2666916 Oh, shit!
2677719 2679637 - Go! Let's go!<br />- I can't!
2687687 2690690 What's wrong with you?!<br />I said go on three, not two!
2690774 2691900 On three!
2692275 2693693 It's always three!
2693777 2694819 Boys!
2695737 2698782 What are we doing here?<br />Losing our heads in a crisis?
2702118 2703661 Cover me! Cover me!
2724057 2725266 Exxon.
2730105 2731648 - What?<br />- Count to 20!
2732399 2735318 - What?!<br />- Count to 20 and then light me!
2739906 2740865 Shit!
2743743 2745745 Riggs, it's loaded with ammo!
2760135 2761886 - Cover me.<br />- Cover you?!
2763888 2765390 Cover you, cover Riggs.
2765473 2768059 When's someone gonna cover me<br />for a change?
2773273 2775984 What's that, 13, 14? To hell with it!
2793001 2795628 It's the cops. They're burning everything!
2807807 2808808 Son of a bitch!
2808850 2810935 Crazy motherfucker!
2815106 2816107 Damn!
2816149 2818485 Riggs, the ammo! Get out of there!
2835543 2838630 - You crazy son of a bitch!<br />- Yeah!
2855730 2858149 Son of a bitch. You're full of shit.
2862404 2863613 Stay there.
2864072 2865615 Shit, where's Riggs?
2880338 2882173 Son of a bitch! No clip!
2884592 2886094 Lorna, no, don't!
2893351 2894811 Come on in, bitch.
2895437 2896646 Door's open!
2921755 2923923 I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!
2952369 2953995 Son of a bitch.
2956289 2957665 Travis!
2959501 2960460 Shit!
2975225 2977268 Armor-piercing bullets, yeah.
2977435 2978812 Cop killers.
2980188 2981940 You're coming with me!
2990824 2992242 Fuck you, asshole!
3005755 3008550 Riggs. Hey, Riggs. Riggs!
3011678 3012887 Get up!
3014055 3015181 Get up!
3015807 3018560 Killed in the line of duty!
3022022 3025275 You'll get a great funeral<br />from the department.
3031531 3033241 Cop killers!
3045670 3047422 Ex-cop killers.
3058224 3060310 Go to hell, Riggs.
3061394 3062645 You first.
3073782 3075241 Crazy bastard!
3081456 3084042 Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.
3086503 3088546 Just hold still. Hold still.
3088672 3090840 Get a chopper, man!<br />Get a chopper.
3091174 3093593 She had two vests on.<br />She's gonna be okay.
3093677 3096179 A couple of bad ones.<br />We need to get a chopper.
3096221 3099557 You're all right, partner.<br />You're fine. Hang on.
3100642 3103812 It's okay, it's okay. Just lie still.<br />Just lie still.
3103978 3107273 Just a romantic evening<br />by the fire, just the two of us.
3107565 3108942 Just be still.
3119285 3122038 Honey, open your eyes. Open your eyes.
3122580 3123957 Open your eyes.
3128003 3130338 What were you trying to prove out there?
3130422 3131965 Why do you do that?
3132507 3134342 - Can I take this off?<br />- Yeah.
3136511 3140640 You're supposed to grow old<br />with someone, not because of them.
3146771 3148398 I'm gonna be with you.
3149024 3151151 I'm with you now. Look, I'm right here.
3151234 3153445 We're both here, right? Right.
3155405 3157490 Come on, I want to be with you.
3157574 3159576 What have you got to lose?
3160618 3161619 You.
3163788 3165206 Not likely.
3170920 3172505 - Hey, Lorna.<br />- Yeah?
3175550 3177635 Let's live to regret this.
3182515 3184434 - We've got to go, Sarg.<br />- Yeah.
3184517 3186061 She's gonna be fine.
3190190 3191649 Can you hear me?
3193193 3194402 I love you.
3212671 3216800 "Happy retirement, Daddy.
3217801 3221846 "Happy retirement, Daddy."
3222305 3224557 This is it. This is the day.
3225475 3226976 Everybody? Daddy?
3227060 3229854 I want you to know there's a candle<br />for every year in the force.
3229938 3232357 Yes! A lot of years.
3232524 3234943 You have to blow it out. Come on!
3237404 3238321 I can't.
3238405 3241324 - Come on, blow it out.<br />- That's not what I mean.
3241574 3242951 What?
3243493 3245120 I can't retire.
3246538 3248790 I thought I could. I wanted to.
3250250 3251459 But I can't.
3256089 3258341 That means you're gonna<br />stay with the force?
3258425 3261052 That means I'm staying<br />with the force, baby.
3263930 3268018 This cake's about to explode,<br />so you better blow out these candles.
3269185 3272439 I want you to know<br />that I'm behind you all the way.
3272981 3274983 - Me, too.<br />- So am I, Dad.
3275066 3276276 It's okay.
3276359 3279988 Well, the streets will be safer<br />for another couple of years.
3281698 3283283 Word, Nick?
3283408 3284701 Word, Dad.
3287787 3289497 Blow out!
3290457 3291708 Hello?
3291791 3293543 Hello! In here!
3294377 3296379 Hello. I gotta talk to Roger.
3298214 3299591 Oprah should see this.
3299674 3302135 I can't believe this!<br />Okay, this is great!
3302218 3303678 What is it?
3304054 3306973 Where's Riggs?<br />Can he hold his breath that long?
3308141 3309517 I'm taking a bath, Leo.
3309601 3313396 I can see that. And it's cold water, too.<br />There goes your image.
3314564 3316399 Listen, I got great news.
3316483 3319444 Once again, Leo Getz has delivered.
3319611 3321863 Okay, I have sold this turkey.
3322572 3327327 This termite-infested dump is now gone.<br />Okay?
3327535 3331164 All you have to do is sign the contract<br />before the suckers change their mind.
3331247 3333500 Okay? I did it! I did it!
3334209 3335794 The house is off the market.
3335877 3340006 We're gonna stay in this termite-infested<br />turkey for another ten years!
3340048 3342717 - At least!<br />- I'll get married here!
3343343 3345428 - Come on, out.<br />- You can't do this.
3345470 3347931 - Out, out.<br />- No, you can't do that.
3348556 3351518 You can't do that.<br />I have contracts signed.
3351685 3354270 Because we're partners,<br />no commission. Okay?
3354312 3355271 Partners?
3355355 3357607 You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
3357691 3358692 Why?
3358775 3362320 Because bullets aren't covered<br />in normal road hazard. That's why!
3362404 3364572 I want those tires! No conditions!
3364656 3366324 Leo, get out of here!
3366408 3368743 - Don't tell me to get out!<br />- Out! Out!
3368785 3371788 Okay, I'm going.<br />You're lucky your wife's here!
3375792 3377502 Don't come to me if the...
3377585 3378378 Get out!
3378461 3381339 - Termites get you...<br />- No more!
3383967 3385343 Your friends.
3387345 3389889 Ten more years till forced retirement?
3391641 3395353 That's 3,650 days.
3396271 3398314 - Forty-nine.<br />- Oh, yeah.
3410285 3412579 I gotta improve my image.
3424174 3425800 Bye, Daddy!
3428553 3429929 Bye, baby.
3439606 3441441 What are you smiling at?
3442484 3444069 Why weren't you at my party?
3444152 3445904 I knew you weren't going to retire.
3445945 3449824 I've been wrong about a couple of things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
3449908 3452285 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
3452369 3455205 I'm smoking to forget<br />my dog biscuit problem.
3455288 3456748 What dog biscuit problem?
3456831 3459167 I've been chasing more cars lately...
3459209 3462253 ...and when I try to lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
3462337 3463755 Jesus Christ.
3464631 3466466 I'm driving. Other side.
3466591 3469678 I got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.
3469761 3471346 Thank you for opening it.
3471429 3473932 Do you need some help?<br />An old fella like you...
3474015 3475183 I'll show you a fella my age.
3475266 3478144 - Who's a grumpy bastard?<br />- I'm a grumpy bastard.
3478812 3480563 - You know something?<br />- What?
3480689 3484526 When I do retire, I hope<br />your next partner is just like you.
3484943 3488947 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.
3489155 3490657 He did it to me.
3491324 3492367 I know.
3493827 3495245 See what I mean?
3497372 3498790 My point, exactly.
3498915 3500458 Son of a bitch!
3504170 3505797 Stay away from my daughter.
3505880 3508508 You can't be serious.<br />What are you talking about?
3508591 3510218 I saw you kiss Rianne.
3510301 3512429 She kissed me.<br />She finds me irresistible.
3512470 3515765 - That's not the point!<br />- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
3515849 3518727 If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
3518768 3522022 - Getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />- I'm getting enough fiber!
3522105 3523982 I'm spoken for, okay?
3524190 3527152 I'm gonna pick Lorna up<br />from the hospital this afternoon.
3527193 3528653 We're practically...
3528737 3531406 - You're serious?<br />- We got a dog and everything.
3531489 3534242 I figure I can make ends meet.
3543501 3546463 All units! All units! Code 2, High.
3546796 3549507 Don't even think about it. Don't even try.
3549632 3552927 This is us, rolling to Code 2, High,<br />at Verrina Place.
3553053 3556097 Shit. This time we wait<br />for the bomb squad.
3556139 3558850 You think I want to end up<br />in uniform again?
3749290 3753461 20-William-12, the REA bomb squad's<br />en route. All units.
3753795 3756047 Those guys gonna get in the way again?
3756548 3758717 There it is. Happy? Let's go.
3758925 3761011 We ain't seen nothing yet, Rog.
3761177 3763722 - Get me closer.<br />- It's roped off!
3763805 3767517 - Can't see the bomb squad anywhere.<br />- They're coming!
3767600 3770020 Stop here and I'll just get out.
3770311 3772647 No, don't get out of the car, Riggs!
3773023 3775358 Tell me, was it red wire or blue...
3775608 3777986 - Let's get out of here.<br />- Step on the gas!
3778069 3779529 They'll never believe this!
3779612 3782157 - I hope nobody saw us.<br />- They'll blame me.
3782615 3786161 Let's keep cool. You better get<br />your girdle out of mothballs.
3786244 3788788 They'll say, "Back in uniform again."
3788830 3790790 Ten more years of this!
3791374 3794669 - I'm too old for this shit.<br />- I'm too old for this shit.
