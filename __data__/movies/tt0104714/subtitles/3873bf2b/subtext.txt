103186 104479 Riggs, Homicide.
104646 106231 Nobody's dead.<br />Night's young.
106398 107899 This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
108066 109610 - Threat or scare?<br />- The real thing.
109776 111194 This gentleman saw the device.
111361 114489 On Level 1, near the gas pumps.<br />I wrote the license plate down.
114656 116325 That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
116491 118619 - Have you evacuated the building?<br />- It's clean.
118785 120203 - Bomb squad?<br />- On their way.
120370 122539 - It's under control. Let's go.<br />- Bomb squad?
122706 124583 Rog, I think we ought to check this out.
124750 127210 - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />- What?
127586 129713 - Bomb squad's on their way.<br />- There's no bomb.
129880 132341 - How can you be sure?<br />- Because it's a full moon.
132507 134718 Moon, lunar, lunatics.<br />They're everywhere.
134885 136553 - Hey, is that Greek?<br />- No, no. Latin.
136720 138889 Latin. Man, you surprise<br />the shit out of me.
139056 141266 There's no bomb.<br />It's probably a false alarm.
141433 143727 It happens. Probably saw<br />a radio on the back seat.
143894 146647 Hey, hey. Let's not mess with this.<br />Wait for the bomb squad.
146813 149024 You're right.<br />You sit tight, I'll be right back.
149191 151777 - Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />- What's the matter with you?
151943 154196 - There's a bomb in that building.<br />- There's not.
154363 155989 - There's a bomb!<br />- There is not.
156156 158659 There's a bomb in that building!<br />Know how come I know?
158825 160702 - How?<br />- I got eight days to retirement.
160869 162704 And I will not make a stupid mistake.
162871 163955 There is no bomb.
164122 167918 I will bet vital parts of my anatomy<br />to the fact. Now, look. Look.
168085 170462 Trust me. Okay? Trust me.
173965 176259 That's usually my first mistake.
176927 178387 -Hey, Riggs.<br />Yo.
178553 180097 Hey, wait. I'm coming.
180263 181598 Hey, Rog?<br />Yeah?
181765 184309 Your insurance paid up?<br />Yeah, of course. Why?
184768 188397 There could be a bomb in here.<br />Oh, God.
190273 191316 I hate it when I'm right.
192693 195946 - You ought to learn to trust your instincts.<br />- Oh, God.
196113 198740 First impression<br />can often be the right one.
200075 203537 Leak in his diff. About to drop his<br />drive shaft. No wonder there's a bomb.
203704 205497 Just don't touch it.
206832 208291 Just looking.
209501 211086 Right.
213630 217300 What are you gonna do?<br />Don't open the door. Don't open the door!
221471 222973 Son of a bitch, just look at it.
223140 225976 - Just look at it.<br />- That's all I'm gonna do, is look.
228729 231064 Oh, my. There's more plastic than Cher.
231356 234818 I love this job. This is amateur night.<br />Open the door. I can't hear you.
235235 236820 Open the door.
237195 238530 Don't do nothing.
239823 241450 Not that one! Mm-mm!
241616 242909 You son of a bitch.
243076 246246 Well, this is a pretty shonky job.<br />I can dismantle it.
246413 249082 It looks like Beirut to me.<br />Let's get the hell out of here.
252836 256006 Everybody's outside. Just me, you<br />and this cat are dumb enough to be here.
256173 258425 Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh? Heh.
259384 262387 - Relax, Rog. Relax. Right.<br />- Don't do nothing.
262554 264514 We got nine minutes<br />and seven seconds left.
264681 266183 - Know what we could do?<br />- What?
266349 269227 - We could drive this out.<br />- Fine, it's your turn to drive.
269394 271271 No keys. Tsk, tsk. I could hot-wire it.
271438 274691 Aah! Don't even say "hot-wire"<br />around this stuff, man.
274858 277944 - You're right, you're right.<br />- Why am I doing this? Why am I...?
278111 281114 Looks like we're gonna have to do it<br />the old-fashioned way.
281281 285702 Riggs, what are you thinking?<br />What are you thinking, Riggs? Riggs.
285869 288121 - I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.<br />- Wait!
288288 290207 - That's not what I think.<br />- You think red?
290373 291625 No. No.
291792 294252 I'm thinking that it's<br />eight minutes and 42 seconds.
294419 298006 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, have a cappuccino.
298173 301802 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />It's eight minutes and 31 seconds.
301968 304304 - Rog, please.<br />- Forget the cappuccino.
304471 307808 - You know what they're gonna say?<br />- "Get the fuck out of here."
307974 311770 After that, they're gonna say, "Cut the<br />blue wire," which I'm gonna do right now.
312312 314523 - Hey, hey. Wait, wait. Riggs. Wait.<br />- What?
314689 316942 - How can you be so sure?<br />- Oh, it's just a hunch.
317108 319319 - A hunch?<br />- Remember the bomb under your toilet?
319486 322572 - Oh, shit. How could I forget?<br />- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
322739 325951 This is more simplified.<br />A bit more powerful, but more simplified.
326117 329496 - From where I was sitting, I couldn't see.<br />- Forget it. Come on, trust me.
329663 330914 Yeah, so I gotta trust you?
331081 333834 Guess not.<br />Well, I'm cutting the red wire, okay?
334000 336169 Oh! Oh!
336336 339756 - What? What?<br />- A minute ago you said blue.
340590 343009 - Did I say blue?<br />- Riggs, you said blue.
343510 344928 - Well, I meant red.<br />- You sure?
345262 346972 We can do it your way if you'd like.
347138 349266 - My way? I don't have...!<br />- Quiet!
349432 352769 - I'm sure, okay?<br />- Shit.
354729 356565 You ready?
356731 358441 - Rog?<br />- What?
358942 362153 Won't you kind of miss all this good stuff<br />when you retire?
362320 365115 Aren't you gonna miss it a little bit? Huh?
367158 368577 I'm cutting the wire.
369369 370412 Snip. See? All done.
373039 374916 - Rog.<br />- Yeah?
376126 378712 - Grab the cat.<br />- Grab the cat?
378879 381798 Get back! Take cover!
441733 443193 Where are they?
448657 450075 Bravo.
455038 456373 Oops.
457916 459584 Right. Oops.
462045 463922 Right.
468927 471930 Seven days to retirement,<br />I'm busted down to patrolman.
472097 474557 I should've cut the red wire.
474724 476810 - You did.<br />- No, I didn't. I cut the blue wire.
476977 480063 That's what I meant.<br />We should've waited for the bomb squad.
480230 481898 Am I gonna have to listen to this?
482065 484609 - Every day until I retire.<br />- That'll be a week too long.
484776 486069 Ah, shit.
486236 488488 - My feet are killing me.<br />- They're killing me too.
488655 491074 - How?<br />- I gotta listen to you bitch about them!
491241 495620 - Because you should've cut the red wire!<br />- I did cut the red wire!
496162 499374 What's this? It's kind of soft.<br />It's not a bulletproof vest.
499541 502419 - It's not gonna keep anything out.<br />- Gonna keep my stomach in.
502794 504754 What do you got under there?
505255 507674 - It's a girdle.<br />- What?
508174 510135 Oh, God. It's a girdle.
511094 512220 Trish know about this?
512387 514180 Not a woman's girdle, a man's girdle.
514347 516891 - They make girdles for men?<br />- They make girdles for men.
517058 518393 - They do, huh?<br />- Yeah, they do.
518560 521771 I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.<br />Cleaners must have shrunk it.
521938 523481 Well, you should take it to Chin.
523648 526693 I did take it to Chin over in Alpine.<br />Look at it. It's shrunk all up in here.
528486 530447 - Have to hold my breath.<br />- Did you see that?
530613 532949 - See what?<br />- Jaywalker.
533700 534826 Jaywalking?
535326 537454 Hold it right there, pal.<br />Step up here, please.
537620 538955 - Me?<br />- Yes, you.
539122 540707 - What did I do?<br />- Stand there.
540874 543835 What'd you do? Jaywalking.<br />I saw you. I have to cite you.
544002 546046 Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on.
546212 548465 Can you handle this<br />or should I radio for backup?
548631 551134 - Got the ticket book?<br />- People are committing crimes...
551301 553636 - and you're hassling me?<br />- Shut up!
553803 554846 Yeah.
556723 557766 Oh!
557932 561519 - Do you know how to fill one of these out?<br />- A long time ago. Let me see.
561686 563480 Can't read it. The print is little.
563646 565398 - Without my glasses.<br />- You're no help.
565565 568818 Can we speed this up? You may<br />have nothing to do. I have things to do.
568985 571863 No, we can't, so will you shut up?
572030 574157 - Jaywalking.<br />- Ask for his license.
574324 576201 - License for jaywalking?<br />- Yeah, jaywalking.
576367 579162 I don't have it on me, okay?<br />I wasn't driving, okay?
579329 581456 I was walking.<br />What, do I need a walking license now?
581623 584084 - Oh, let's just shoot him.<br />- Oh, oh, oh, what is he crazy?
584250 587253 I'm gonna drill him.<br />We can make it look like suicide.
587420 590298 - Get out of the way!<br />- No, no, no. The video cameras.
590465 591925 I don't care! I'm gonna drill him!
592092 595428 Get out of here, before my partner<br />kills you! Go that way, not that way!
595595 596638 This way! Over there!
596805 599599 -Go, run! Now! Run!<br />Right there, yeah.
607440 609567 Hey. Hey!
610026 613696 Hey, wait a minute.<br />You forgot to sign.
614280 617617 - Hey.<br />- What's that?
618201 620703 Wait a minute.<br />You forgot to sign the form.
620870 623623 Hey, who are you?<br />You're not the regular guy.
623790 625959 He's on vacation.<br />On vacation?
626126 628002 Well, who the hell is that?
628962 630213 Get in the truck! Get!
637762 639389 You fucking prick!
643643 645228 Riggs! Riggs!<br />Are you all right?
647147 648523 - Hey, are you a cop?<br />- Yeah.

653361 656447 All right, honey.<br />Let me drive. We're in pursuit.
656614 658867 I'm driving, baby! Don't worry.
665456 668501 This fool picked the wrong time<br />to mess with the wrong lady.
668668 669961 All right. Just stay close.
676634 680054 Hey, hey, hey. Right behind you, baby.<br />That's right. Take a good look.
680221 683057 Delores the Road Warrior<br />is dead on your raggedy ass.
692150 693276 Ram him! Ram him!
699949 701409 - Watch out, Riggs.<br />- Come on!
710585 713296 - Are you married, sugar?<br />- What? Yeah, 24 years.
713463 715924 - Yeah, 24 years.<br />- Yeah, but is it working?
721638 724140 - Hey, you can't get closer?<br />- I am. I'm getting closer.
726809 728978 Hold on, Riggs! Hold on!
737946 740531 Hey, hey!<br />- Hold on! Hold on! We got you.
740698 742116 Hold on!

746996 748456 I am. I am, all right?
753795 755004 - Back off, back off!<br />- Aah!
767433 771020 - If he falls, don't hit him.<br />- Don't worry. I got something for you.
808057 809058 Whoa!
809225 812562 Ooh, hoo-hoo! Thanks for the interest,<br />sugar, but one thing at a time.
827285 829120 - Catch him, catch him.<br />- All right.
831748 833583 Keep singing, baby. Just stay close.
840923 841924 Relax, baby. Relax, baby.
842091 844844 Ho! Ho! Ho!<br />Hey, keep your hands off my thigh.
845011 847597 - My partner's in trouble. Watch out for him.<br />- I got him!
860777 864781 - Boy, I'm getting too old for this shit.<br />- Not for me, you're not, sugar.
867867 870453 You have the right<br />to remain unconscious.
870828 872308 Anything you say ain't gonna be much.
877627 879212 Hey, Riggs. You all right?<br />- Ha!
879379 883299 I'm okay. I think we gotta book this guy<br />for not wearing his seat belt though.
883466 885468 Hey, that was dynamite driving.
885635 889180 - No, she's the dynamite driver.<br />- I'll show you dynamite.
889347 892475 Whoo!<br />- Sure enough. Whoo!
892892 896396 - What have you two been up to?<br />- What do you mean? We were in pursuit.
896562 898856 - I saw you kiss her.<br />- No, I didn't. She kissed me.
899023 903027 It looked mutual. Wipe that lipstick off<br />before the guys at the station start talking.
903194 904695 Hey, go spit, Riggs.
906155 908491 You okay? You all right?
909826 911452 Back to bed. Back to bed.
911786 914163 -Morning, guys. Daddy.<br />Hey.
914330 917375 Hey, how about treating your dad<br />to breakfast today, okay?
918334 921629 - You got six more days to go.<br />- Laundry service.
922839 924382 Hold this. Hangers?
924549 928052 I'm springing for the soap.<br />Nothing too fancy. That's a cute dog.
928219 929971 - It's a Westie.<br />- Morning. Westie?
930138 931764 -Morning, Trish.<br />Hey.
931931 933558 Morning, Rog.
934350 935518 - Hey, Nick.<br />- Spare me.
935685 938354 -What? Didn't you brush your teeth?<br />Hold it, mister.
938521 940523 I'm just looking for some orange juice.
940690 944068 Don't get fingerprints on the door,<br />and put the glass in the dishwasher.
944235 947697 - Did somebody commit a murder?<br />- Somebody's coming to see the house.
947864 950074 Oh. Hey, I think a little mess<br />adds to the charm.
960835 962545 How's this, huh?
962753 964714 This great? Okay? Okay?

970595 973848 Oh, hi, honey. How are you?<br />I thought I asked you not to call me here.
974432 977101 -It's for you, Rog.<br />Me?
977435 978728 Hmm?
979061 980730 Uh, who are...? Who is it? Hello?

989822 991991 See how quiet it is here? Listen, listen.
992158 993326 That great? Come on.
993493 995828 - Very quiet.<br />- The inside's better than the outside.
995995 998748 It's the people to look at the house.<br />- And our broker.
1001667 1003878 Okay, okay. Just wanna make sure.
1004045 1007340 I gotta show you this room first.<br />This is my favorite. This is great.

1013804 1014847 Shh. Shh. Shh.
1015014 1017725 You do? It's been completely replaced.<br />Oh, why was that?
1017892 1020853 A drug dealer came through with his car<br />and crashed right in.
1021020 1022730 Shot up the whole place. Shh.
1022897 1025107 Son of a bitch.<br />I'm gonna cut him off at the...
1025274 1027068 - Ha, ha! Leo.<br />- Oh, ha. Drug dealer.

1029695 1032865 Okay, anyway, look. Like the drapes?<br />Maybe she'll leave the drapes.
1033032 1034909 Hey, I thought you quit, huh?<br />- I did.
1035076 1037703 - You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.<br />- I'm edgy.
1037870 1041249 -You're edgy? Here.<br />That stuff about the drug dealer...
1041415 1042625 Chew on these.
1042792 1044877 Listen, I have to tell you<br />these things, okay?
1045044 1047129 It's the law. It's called full disclosure.
1047296 1049590 Anything else you wanna disclose<br />before we go on?
1051092 1054220 Okay, now that you mention it, the<br />bathroom has been completely remodeled...
1054387 1055930 due to unexpected bomb damage.
1056097 1057974 Hey, hey, hey, come on. It's okay.
1058140 1060017 -Son of a bitch. I'm gonna...<br />Shh. Shh.

1067275 1069485 Okay, okay.<br />So, uh, we saw enough of the kitchen.
1069652 1072655 Let me show you upstairs.<br />Wait till you see this. It's beautiful.
1072822 1074323 You're really gonna love this.
1078828 1081497 They're gone.<br />Leo Getz, I guess I'm gonna kill him.
1081664 1084083 Son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill him!<br />I'm gonna Kill him!
1084250 1086752 Don't...<br />He's trying to ruin me, Riggs.
1087295 1090131 - Hey, Leo, you got...<br />- They weren't gonna buy the house!
1090298 1093759 - Yeah, you scared them away.<br />- No, they couldn't afford the financing.
1093926 1096095 - Oh, Jesus.<br />- Okay, relax.
1096262 1099599 I had to tell them everything. It's<br />the law, okay? I mean, full disclosure.
1099765 1101885 - You must have heard of it.<br />- I'm a cop. I'm the law.
1101976 1103019 - Ah!<br />- Ow!
1103185 1106063 -Get off me! What is it with you?<br />Hold it.
1107356 1108399 Okay, okay.
1108566 1111235 At least he didn't tell them<br />about that nail-gun incident.
1111402 1113529 - I forgot.
1113696 1116115 Did you have a permit<br />when you built over the garage?
1116282 1118242 - Permit?<br />- You know what I'll do? Hold it.
1118409 1121120 Leo's here. I'll take care of it.<br />I'll make a couple calls.
1121287 1122955 We'll get some back-dated permits.
1123122 1125291 - Which phone can I use?<br />- Uh, sun room. Sun room.
1125458 1128044 - Okay, okay, okay. I got you.<br />- Jesus Christ.
1128210 1130880 -It's gotta be easier than this.<br />They don't know Leo Getz.
1131047 1133924 You could do with less aggravation.<br />Come to work with me.
1134091 1137261 Yeah. Thank you, Leo. Son of a bitch.
1137428 1139722 Stop fronting yourself.<br />You know what I'm saying?
1139889 1141849 Swing with me and my crew.<br />That's the move.
1146979 1148898 Forget school.
1150983 1153444 Oh, man. Here comes your pops, man.
1153736 1155613 - Later, man.<br />- All right, I gotcha.
1155780 1158574 -All right, bro. I'm out, man.<br />Next time, G. Peace, bro.
1161494 1163371 Morning, Rog.<br />How you doing?
1163537 1165665 How you doing, Mr. Fisher?<br />Hey, Nick.
1165831 1167583 Hey, Nick.
1167750 1170378 - Uh, wasn't that Darryl?<br />- Yeah.
1170544 1172421 Haven't seen him around in a while.
1173506 1176926 - He dropped out of school.<br />- Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.
1177093 1178594 Yeah, I know.
1179929 1181055 Hey, Nick.
1182098 1184433 - Yeah, Dad.<br />- Be good.
1185309 1186811 Word.
1188646 1190272 Hey, word, Nick.
1190648 1192108 Word.
1195069 1197780 - Word, Riggs.<br />- Word, Rog.
1198447 1199990 - What are we talking about?<br />- Word.
1200157 1202451 Starts with a W,<br />"or" in the middle, D on the end.
1202618 1204704 - Word. Oh, yeah, that word.<br />- Where you been?
1204870 1207289 - Word.<br />- Word.
1220594 1223639 Hey, Tyrone, my man, how are you?<br />Jack, how's it going?
1223806 1225891 - Let's take a walk.<br />- Hey, wait here for me.
1226058 1228811 Look around. This is my dream<br />and it's all coming true.
1228978 1232732 You sank your money into this, out here<br />in the middle of the fucking desert?
1232898 1235151 That's right.<br />Know why it's gonna be a gold mine?
1235317 1236360 Do tell me.
1236527 1240030 Because nobody wants to live next door<br />to people like you. You're a menace.
1240197 1243451 Jack, I came out here to do business,<br />not be insulted by you.
1243617 1244952 Relax, Tyrone.
1245119 1247621 Just like houses,<br />friendships need strong foundations.
1247788 1251167 Hey, Smitty, come here. Come here.
1253085 1256338 What's wrong with you? Don't I<br />pay you good? Don't I take care of you?
1256505 1257506 Sure you do, Jack.
1257673 1260259 What's this stupid business<br />you and Billy tried to pull?
1260426 1263804 - It was a good plan. It worked.<br />- It worked? It didn't work.
1263971 1265347 You got nailed first time out.
1265514 1268184 Nobody who works for me<br />goes into business for themselves.
1268350 1269643 Understand what I'm saying?
1269810 1272021 See how that can jeopardize everything?<br />Right, Tyrone?
1272188 1273606 Heh, heh, whatever.
1273773 1276192 Especially trying to pop an armored car.
1276776 1280279 Okay, Billy got caught.<br />There's nothing I can do about that now.
1280446 1283073 He's gonna have to face the music<br />on his own.
1283365 1286494 But you and me, Smitty,<br />we're gonna start over.
1286660 1288412 You know what I mean?
1289371 1291207 - Whatever you say, Jack.<br />- Good.
1291373 1293375 Glad you understand<br />what I'm talking about.
1300174 1302384 Now we got a relationship<br />we can build on.
1304720 1307890 - Employee problems. You know how it is?<br />- Yeah, right.
1308057 1310976 You invest time and energy<br />into training somebody.
1311143 1314355 They get greedy and do something stupid<br />that jeopardizes everything.
1314605 1315815 It's a bitch.
1316232 1318150 Stick around. This is the good part.
1318567 1321862 We can put our initials in there. Yeah?
1322029 1323739 Jesus Christ.
1327117 1329328 Lankershim and Vineland.<br />Where are we going, Rog?
1329495 1333749 Uh, right here. Rianne's got<br />a new job. I promised her I'd stop by.
1333916 1335459 That's a good reason.
1336293 1339129 All right. Here we are.
1345010 1348305 - You got any silver, any change?<br />- We're cops.
1348472 1351350 That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.<br />I'll get change.
1361193 1364280 Where are you going? Get down!<br />Get down! All of you, get down!
1378127 1380337 Riggs! Riggs!
1385509 1388470 How do you like that, huh?<br />What are you doing with a rubber gun?
1388637 1391015 - No! This is a film. There are not...<br />- What?
1391181 1394226 Cut, cut, cut!<br />Who the fuck is this lunatic?
1394393 1396687 -Get him off my set.<br />This isn't part of the story.
1396854 1399148 Can we get a cop?<br />Where did you come from?
1399315 1400649 Jesus. Who are you?
1400816 1403944 Rianne, I'm so sorry.<br />I feel like a microbe right now.
1404111 1406405 -You really thought I was in trouble?<br />Oh, I did.
1406572 1409408 - You did?<br />- A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.
1409575 1411452 What is wrong with you?<br />Are you an idiot?
1411619 1412661 I apologize.
1412828 1416624 - He's a friend of mine, a policeman.<br />- Yeah, we're both here to visit...
1416790 1418042 Oh, he's a friend of yours?
1418208 1422004 Let me tell you something, okay?<br />You're fired. All right. Have a nice day.
1422171 1424006 Fired? Riggs, what did you do?
1424840 1428636 - You're not fired. Don't worry.<br />- No, you're not. Take it easy, Riggs.
1428802 1430638 You can't fire her for something I did.
1430804 1432973 I don't care whose mistake it was.<br />She's fired.
1433140 1435851 I apologize to everybody.<br />- Don't push him.
1436018 1437353 - Don't push.<br />- All of you, go!
1437519 1439647 Just take it easy.<br />Don't push him. Don't push.
1439813 1442691 Get off my set, all right?<br />What are you, deaf? Go.
1442858 1444068 Move. Get off my set.
1444234 1446362 On any normal day,<br />I'd smack you in the mouth.
1446528 1448447 - Is that so?<br />- Don't hit him.
1448614 1449907 It's a normal day.
1451158 1453410 I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay?<br />I'm sorry.
1453577 1456789 God, I'm all thumbs. Look, he fell down.<br />Let me help you up.
1456956 1458499 I said don't hit him, Riggs.
1458666 1460542 Is she fired?<br />Yes, she's fired.
1460709 1461794 - Is she fired?<br />- No.
1461961 1463796 She got a raise?<br />- It's all right.
1463963 1465881 - Yes. I said yes. Thank you.<br />- Good.
1466048 1470052 - Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.<br />- Yeah.
1470386 1471971 We'd like you to come back.
1473681 1475057 All right.
1477017 1479144 You can't settle every problem<br />with your fists.
1479311 1482106 - I couldn't use my gun. There was a crowd.<br />- Okay, six more days.
1482272 1484066 Look, I don't wanna hear that anymore.
1484233 1487403 Hey, did Rianne get her job back?<br />Did she get a raise? Did she?
1487569 1489363 I don't hear a "thank you."
1489530 1492992 Maybe I should, uh, become one of those<br />Hollywood agents. What do you think?
1493158 1495619 - Hmm. Won't work.<br />- Why?
1495786 1500040 - You gotta have killer instinct.<br />- Heh. Son of a bitch.
1500249 1504128 - We should've put the bag on the meter.<br />- Put it in the glove compartment.
1504294 1507256 - No, no. I don't do that anymore.<br />- Oh, yeah? Good man.
1507423 1509758 No, it's full up already.<br />Put it in the back seat.
1513846 1516974 - You really like those things, huh?<br />- What, these? Yeah, it's good.
1519768 1523063 Hey, you know, you can eat a box of them.<br />I'm still dying for a cigarette.
1526442 1529570 - What, you cut yourself shaving?<br />- Yeah.
1529737 1533407 - Old razor?<br />- Old face.
1534992 1538746 I think you're really letting this<br />retirement thing get you down, Rog.
1538912 1542082 Why don't you spend a couple<br />more years, think it over. Why quit?
1542249 1544460 - I got plans for my retirement.<br />- Yeah, plans.
1544626 1546420 - I do. Big plans.<br />- Sure. Big plans?
1546587 1548547 - I had them for a long time.<br />- Like what?
1548714 1550132 Like, uh...
1551008 1554762 - Uh, hey, things, man. Okay, yeah, huh?<br />- Things. Things.
1554928 1556972 Yeah, yeah. Things I've put off too long.
1557139 1560059 - Those things. I got those things too.<br />- Yeah, Riggs. Right.
1560225 1563353 I can see you've given this<br />a lot of thought, Rog, actually.
1565314 1566815 Yeah.
1567816 1570027 I've given it a lot of thought, Riggs.
1589004 1590714 Goddamn it!
1590881 1592049 What the hell's going on?
1592216 1593842 I'm pissed off! You need a reason?
1594009 1595260 I thought I heard gunfire.
1595427 1597513 Get your hearing checked. Put that away.
1598138 1601683 - What are you looking at?<br />- Hey, man. Peace.
1622996 1627668 Riggs, why'd you call us down here?<br />- Everybody, it's all right.
1627835 1630712 Hey, how you doing, son?<br />Your mother know you're here?
1634216 1635801 Hey, did you do this?
1635968 1638512 Nice shooting, phew.<br />- Regular Billy the Kid, huh?
1639888 1641682 Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?
1641849 1644726 Give that to your mom.<br />Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.
1644893 1647479 - Hey, can I borrow your glasses?<br />- Yeah.
1647646 1650524 Okay, who's wearing?<br />Roger, you're wearing. I need you.
1650691 1654736 - Why me? You guys should be wearing.<br />- Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.
1654903 1657072 I've been dressing myself since I was 30.
1657239 1659533 - Okay, man, just trying to help.<br />- Just get back.
1659700 1662244 -All you perverts, turn your heads.<br />Take it off.
1662411 1663996 Hold this shirt.
1664163 1665247 Woo-hoo.
1665414 1667291 Wearing a girdle, man.
1667457 1669710 - He's got a girdle!<br />- This is not a girdle.
1669877 1672754 This is not a girdle. It's my back.<br />My back went out on me.
1672921 1675966 - He hurt his back.<br />- Hurt my back this morning lifting weights.
1676133 1678677 What you talking about?<br />I hurt my back lifting weights.
1678844 1681430 Yeah, I saw him do it.<br />Okay, everybody, listen up.
1681597 1684474 I want you all to have a look<br />at these lovely bullets.
1684641 1686602 These are cute.<br />- Notice the smooth jacket.
1686768 1690355 Pay particular attention to the tip.<br />Good close look at it.
1693942 1697404 Now, you've all seen these vests<br />stop a .357 magnum bullet, haven't you?
1697571 1699198 Yeah.<br />So what?
1699364 1700657 Okay.
1701950 1703118 Observe.
1718133 1720010 Son of a bitch.
1721720 1724181 - Armor-piercing bullets? Jesus.<br />- Yeah, cop killers.
1724348 1725849 Shit.<br />Serious shit.
1726016 1729102 Those bullets came from the gun<br />of a suspect we arrested yesterday.
1729269 1731813 Armored-car guy?<br />- Yeah. They're out on the streets.
1731980 1734942 Vests are optional, boys and girls.<br />Especially boys.
1735108 1737152 Holy fuck.<br />See you, Riggs.
1737319 1739112 Well, let's just keep our eyes open.
1739279 1740989 Cop Killers.
1742991 1744868 Son of a bitch.
1747287 1749164 [, uh, think we should<br />talk to Billy Phelps.
1749331 1751667 I'll have him brought down<br />for interrogation, okay?
1752751 1754086 Yeah.
1759967 1762511 I'm here to talk to a prisoner, sergeant,<br />Billy Phelps.
1762678 1765806 - Can I see all your ID there?<br />- Sure.
1765973 1769184 William Phelps, armored-car suspect.<br />He's been moved to interrogation.
1769351 1771853 - Know where that is?<br />- Sure. Been there a lot.
1772104 1773146 Okay.
1782114 1783365 Same floor.
1783740 1785200 - Hey, Rog.<br />- Hm?
1785367 1786660 I guess now you're retiring...
1786827 1789267 that, uh, Swiss bank account<br />is gonna come in pretty handy.
1790622 1793041 How much you got in there, a million?<br />Million and a half?
1793375 1795711 - Five.<br />- Five.
1795877 1797379 Well, you deserve it, man.
1797546 1800882 It's better than those miserable<br />drug dealers getting it.
1804886 1806513 What are you talking about?
1806680 1809975 Hey, don't sweat it. You laundered it,<br />didn't you? They can't trace it.
1810851 1812686 - They can't trace it.<br />- Well, now, heh...
1812853 1816064 Look, so long as I get an invite<br />to the Casa de Murtaugh, I'm happy.
1816231 1817607 Casa what?
1817774 1819985 - I've never been to Portugal.<br />- Stop joking.
1820152 1821903 - She's a cop, man.<br />- I know she's a cop.
1822070 1824573 She's probably on the take too.<br />What do you take me for?
1824740 1827159 Come on. The whole force is bent.
1827326 1830203 Look, she may be wearing a skirt,<br />but we're all brothers.
1830370 1831621 I don't have nothing there.
1831788 1833623 - I ain't been to Portugal.<br />- Beautiful.
1833790 1836585 This Murtaugh... This...
1839171 1841340 Son of a bitch.
1841506 1842549 Hey, how you doing?
1842716 1844176 -Fine.<br />Who is it today?
1844343 1845635 - Billy...<br />- Billy Phelps.
1846219 1847262 Huh.
1847429 1849056 - Who are you?<br />- Fly me.
1849222 1851266 I'm your friendly Portuguese airline.
1851808 1854561 -She's Infernal Affairs, Rog.<br />How'd you know?
1854728 1858440 Well, I took the liberty of looking<br />at your file folder. It was showing.
1858607 1860359 Lorna Cole.
1860650 1863362 - And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- I used to be.
1863528 1866448 Yeah, what's Infernal Repairs<br />want with our collar?
1866615 1870327 - We're taking over, thanks.<br />- Nobody told us they were taking over.
1870494 1873705 - Nobody has to tell you anything.<br />- I wanna go and see the captain.
1873872 1875207 You wanna go see the captain?
1875374 1877125 - Let's go see the captain.<br />- All right.
1877292 1879461 - And, uh, put on a vest.<br />- Oh, are you wearing one?
1879628 1883298 -Hey, hey, hey. Just take it easy, man.<br />Okay.
1894601 1897270 Hey, guys. Phelps, William.<br />Actually, his name's Billy.
1897437 1899147 - Phelps? You too?<br />- Hi.
1899314 1901650 - Popular guy today.<br />- Somebody with him?
1901817 1904820 No, not really.<br />He's down the hall to the right.
1904986 1907572 - Wanna sign in here, sarge?<br />- Sure.
1907739 1909366 - Miss.<br />- Thank you.
1909533 1912994 - What's Internal Affairs doing here?<br />- Don't start. I just found out myself.
1913161 1915414 This is Herman Walters,<br />chief of intelligence.
1915580 1917499 You haven't met his daughter,<br />Lorna Do one.
1917666 1919251 - Cole.<br />- Pleased to meet you.
1919418 1922295 The Phelps case has been<br />transferred to Internal Affairs.
1922462 1924339 - Why? Tell me why.<br />- I can't tell you.
1924506 1925841 - That's classified.<br />- Classi...?
1926007 1928760 - We busted our buns busting this guy.<br />- Busted is right.
1928927 1930429 He spent the night in hospital.
1930595 1932556 - He forgot to buckle.<br />- We cited him for it.
1932722 1935016 - I know. I read your report.<br />- Yeah.
1935183 1937853 You know, our cases have unfortunately<br />crossed paths here.
1938019 1940355 That's all I can say.<br />We'll take over from here.
1940522 1942232 Captain, what's she talking about?
1942399 1945235 That's classified.<br />- I said, "Captain." I'm talking to him.
1945902 1947028 I'm telling you...
1947195 1949364 I said, "Captain.”<br />I'm talking to the captain.
1949531 1951366 That's classified.<br />I'm talking to him.
1951533 1954161 Bullshit!<br />- Murtaugh. Hey, hey. Riggs!
1955954 1959124 Look, maybe these guys<br />can contribute something to this case.
1959291 1962752 From their records, the only thing<br />they contribute is mayhem and chaos.
1962919 1965088 I'm Chaos and he's Mayhem.<br />We're a double act.
1965255 1968633 - Are we required reading or something?<br />- As a matter of fact, you are.
1968800 1971845 It's a cross between Police Gazette<br />and Mad magazine.
1972012 1974514 -What's wrong with Mad?<br />Nothing, I used to read it.
1974681 1977851 - Oh, yeah, you've got some good taste.<br />- When I was 12.
1978018 1980729 - When you... Yeah.<br />- Hey, hey. Riggs, let's go.
1980896 1982898 We busted him, we can talk to him.<br />Let's go.
1983064 1985233 -Captain.<br />Riggs. Murtaugh.
1985400 1987527 Get your asses back here.
1990614 1992407 You'll be needing these.
1993241 1995076 I'm reinstating both of you.
1995744 1997579 - Don't you just love him?<br />- Yeah.
1998205 2000415 God.<br />No. You're Murtaugh and I'm Riggs.
2001166 2002626 You really are a beautiful man.
2002792 2004753 Yeah, right. Just get rid of the blues.
2004920 2007422 - They don't go with the ponytail.<br />- Absolutely not.
2009508 2011760 - Yeah, right.<br />- And get a haircut.
2011927 2015305 - Of course I won't.<br />- You just exceeded your authority, captain.
2015472 2017849 - That's not the way I see it.<br />- The chief will.
2018016 2020060 -Well, take it up with him.<br />I think I will.
2020227 2021770 We don't want this screwed up.
2021937 2025190 You're gonna have to get him<br />between lunches. Son of a bitch.
2027901 2029444 Hi, Billy.
2031863 2034616 - Jack.<br />- Bye, Billy.
2041831 2043458 See you, Billy.
2050048 2052050 Sergeant, did you get what you need?
2052217 2054803 Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.
2056471 2058557 How long has Phelps been doing this?
2058723 2061518 Doing what?<br />- His armored-car thing.
2061685 2064813 I wouldn't know.<br />I'm not interested in armored cars.
2078076 2080036 I don't think she's telling us everything.
2080203 2081538 Yeah, I think you're right.
2081705 2084499 Boy, these six days is gonna be rough.
2084666 2087210 God, be good to me, please.
2088628 2091256 Shit, son of a bitch knew<br />there was a camera in the wall.
2091423 2093258 Look how he's covering up.
2093425 2095218 -Damn it.<br />Didn't know there was one...
2095385 2096678 in the interrogation room.
2096845 2098179 - There isn't.<br />- Yeah.
2099055 2100473 Installed them six months ago.
2100640 2102475 -Every station.<br />That's great.
2102642 2104644 Six months, and we don't know about it?
2104811 2106855 This is the police police, captain.
2107022 2110483 "Police police." Can you say<br />that three times in a row, real fast?
2110650 2112861 -Am I getting to you?<br />You trying to bait me?
2113028 2115530 - I'm a master of it.<br />- Well, that figures.
2115697 2118533 Hey, heh, baiting master. Great.<br />I'll try that on Trish.
2118700 2121911 Freeze that. Stop it. Jack Travis.
2122078 2125957 Who?<br />- Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
2126458 2127834 He was one of us.
2128001 2130837 Hell of a brutal cop.<br />Could beat a confession out of anyone.
2131004 2132213 One hell of a dirty cop.
2132380 2136092 Never seen so many suspensions and<br />reprimands and charges of misconduct.
2136259 2138887 Well, he's also as tough as they come.
2139346 2141556 - What happened to him?<br />- I don't know.
2141723 2145226 His partner and him were on a stakeout.<br />He went for coffee, never came back.
2145393 2148063 Looks like he's had<br />one cappuccino too many.
2148229 2149731 We better brief Walters.
2150690 2152734 Excuse me, cute stuff.
2152901 2155195 - That's harassment.<br />- "Cute stuff." That's you.
2156154 2159824 - Captain.<br />- Boys, boys. Just the captain.
2159991 2163411 Your involvement in this case ended<br />when Billy Phelps hit the floor.
2163578 2166331 Why don't you go back<br />and beat your street?
2166498 2167540 Really good work.
2167707 2169668 Now's the time to buy.<br />Leo, Not now.
2169834 2171795 -Hey, Roger, Roger.<br />Not now, Leo.
2171961 2174756 - No, no. Not now.<br />- We gotta talk, babe, okay?
2174923 2176800 You're in trouble. You got termites.
2176966 2178218 - Termites?<br />- Uh-huh.
2178385 2180470 - Oh, God.<br />- You're infested.
2180637 2182931 The only thing holding up your house<br />is the paint.
2183098 2186267 Rog, I think we should go.<br />Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
2186434 2189020 We should go to Evidence,<br />pull every file on this guy.
2189187 2191481 I know this guy.<br />What are you watching, Geraldo?
2191648 2192899 - What?<br />- I know the guy.
2193066 2195276 - How do you know him?<br />- I've seen the guy before.
2195443 2197779 - Hey, where?<br />- I don't know. I recognize him...
2197946 2200907 His name's Jack Travis, Leo.<br />Does that ring a bell? Jack Travis.
2201074 2203827 Hey, hey, hey.<br />Hands off the clothes. Okay, baby?
2203993 2206705 - Okay, I'm thinking. Let me think. Okay.<br />- Think.
2206871 2208498 -A big party.<br />Okay.
2208665 2212085 Somebody brought a monkey because<br />the monkey knocked over the salad bar.
2212252 2215296 And this guy comes in,<br />introduced me to another guy...
2215463 2217507 who wants a favor.
2217674 2219384 - I got it. I got it. I got it!<br />- What?
2219551 2220551 He got it.
2220677 2222679 - I remember! I remember!<br />- You remember!
2222846 2225807 Hey, don't do it.<br />Don't let the earring fool you.
2225974 2228143 - Hey, we're back. We're back.<br />- Yeah. Yeah.
2228309 2229644 - All right. Listen.<br />- Yeah.
2229811 2231438 Think I could get a gun this time?
2231604 2233064 No!
2242365 2247203 Okay, this is it. See, these guys always<br />wanted me to do favors for them.
2247370 2251249 Like, some guys wanted broads,<br />another guy wanted Cuban cigars.
2251416 2255712 Your guy, hockey.<br />The best seats in the house.
2257672 2260550 - Where's the seats?<br />- Yeah.
2260717 2263470 Uh, probably by the glass.<br />Around the glass.
2263636 2265889 Does "needle in a haystack"<br />mean anything to you?
2266055 2267557 Why don't we spread out?
2267724 2272145 You know, if we all take a different<br />direction, it'd be like old times.
2272312 2275273 Don't push, lady.<br />I'm on police business here.
2275440 2277400 Just take it easy, now.
2289871 2293208 Go! All right!
2305136 2308264 Los Angeles<br />penalty. Number 15, Tony Brown.
2308431 2310391 Two minutes for high-sticking.
2310558 2312852 Time, 5:15.

2321736 2327492 Nineteenth goal and 41st point<br />for number 3, Max Weinberger.

2334332 2337752 Mr. Jack Travis, this is the L.A.P.D.
2338795 2342048 We know you're in here. We know<br />where you are. Just stay in your seat.
2342215 2344092 Don't be stupid.
2344384 2346719 And I'll be there to escort you out<br />in a minute.
2346886 2350014 There's policemen at every exit,<br />so it's no use trying to run.
2350181 2352141 - Stay where you are.<br />- Smart son of a bitch.
2352308 2354769 Thank you for your cooperation.<br />Play on, boys.
2369492 2370702 Come on, let's go!
2381129 2383298 Get out of my fucking way!
2385967 2390013 Ooh! Ooh! Riggs! Riggs! Roger! Roger!
2394392 2396436 Ooh! Excuse me. Excuse me.
2403651 2406362 Hey!<br />- Riggs!
2409407 2410617 You can't be on the ice.
2415330 2417248 Ooh! Ooh!
2417999 2419751 I got him. I got him.
2421878 2425006 You have the right to remain...<br />You're under arrest.
2434349 2436851 Fucking weasel.<br />What the hell's going on here?
2437018 2438019 I'M L.A.P.D. L.A.P.D.
2438186 2440480 I don't care. You can't be on the ice.
2440647 2443107 What is this, a convention?
2447737 2450281 - I got him.<br />- You're all right, pal. Just stay calm.
2454202 2455411 Tell my mother, Rog.
2455578 2458247 - Where did he go?<br />- Down there. Down there.
2468675 2471219 Son of a bitch.
2473054 2475056 He thinks I don't know I'm dying.<br />I know it.
2475223 2478476 - No. You'll be okay.<br />- Yeah, yeah. I'm dying, Roger.
2478643 2481896 - You'll be okay.<br />- I'm choking, see?
2482063 2484023 This is what they do when they die.<br />I saw them.
2484190 2487527 - Leo, it's gonna be okay.<br />- Yeah, well, I'm... I'm numb.
2487694 2489821 My whole body's numb. I can't feel it.
2489988 2492657 - Leo, Leo.<br />- I'm gonna die, I know it. What?
2493074 2494659 You're lying on the ice.
2496577 2499497 - That's why I'm cold?<br />- That's why you're cold.
2499664 2501833 - That's why I'm numb, huh?<br />- That's why you're numb.
2502000 2503710 He shot me. Look at all the blood.
2503876 2506796 -It's just a flesh wound.<br />So it's okay.
2506963 2509257 Let's get you up. One, two, three.<br />Yeah.
2509424 2511676 There you go. You're gonna make it.
2511843 2514804 He's okay, he's okay.<br />He's gonna make it. He's alive.
2514971 2516723 Ooh! Ow, ow!
2521185 2524772 - Bring him this way, guys.<br />- I can't believe this. I just...
2524939 2527191 - I can't believe I got shot.<br />- You'll be all right.
2527358 2528651 - Riggs, you here?<br />- Calm down.
2528818 2531946 We're all the same now.<br />We all got shot.
2532113 2534073 You'll be fine.<br />- Ouch. That's...
2534240 2537368 - Relax, Mr. Getz.<br />- I'm fine. Nothing wrong with me.
2537535 2538911 I can take this. Ouch!
2539078 2542290 We're gonna take care of it.<br />You'll be out of here. No big deal.
2542457 2544738 I don't think that's a good idea.<br />You shouldn't rush this.
2544876 2546544 -Yeah.<br />You should rest up, Leo.
2546711 2548129 A dumdum wound can be serious.
2548796 2550381 What's a dumdum wound?
2550923 2554927 You don't know? A guy got his thumb<br />shot off by a dumdum.
2555094 2557138 From the shock,<br />he was dead two days later.
2557305 2558931 Dead two days later?
2559098 2560433 He died from dumdums?
2560600 2563019 We'll keep you overnight.<br />- Yeah, take it slow.
2563186 2565480 Two days? All right,<br />we'll keep him two days.
2565646 2567982 - You'll be here two days.<br />- That Leo's chart?
2568149 2570902 Two days, you'll be good as new.<br />I should be with them.
2571069 2573446 - Bye, Leo.<br />- I should be with... Hey! Ow! Ouch!
2574113 2577492 -How do you spell, "proctological”?<br />Rectal exam?
2577867 2580828 - No, you can't do that to Leo.<br />- Sure we can.
2580995 2583539 - Why's she taking...?<br />- Please, Mr. Getz. You'll get...
2583706 2586751 You've been shot in the arm.<br />Let her take it. You'll get it back.
2586918 2588669 -Okay.<br />There's a clock in your room.
2588836 2590838 Okay, fine. Riggs.<br />- Yeah?
2591005 2592423 This look like a dumdum wound?
2593174 2595551 -It sounded like one when it happened.<br />Shit.
2595718 2598471 -Take it easy. Two days.<br />Two days and you'll be out.
2598638 2599680 -All right.<br />Okay?
2599847 2602517 -Hey, I'll see you guys.<br />We won't make a move without you.
2602683 2604769 I thought that bullet sounded different.
2604936 2607355 -Relax. They'll be there when you get out.<br />I'm fine.
2607522 2609816 - You own your own house, doc?<br />- What?
2609982 2611901 -You don't recognize my face?<br />No, sir.
2612068 2613361 Watch.
2614070 2617490 About time. These doggy treats<br />are okay, but I need some human food.
2617657 2618699 Don't worry.
2618866 2622328 I'm about to make you one of the best<br />things you ever had in your life.
2622703 2627125 - Hey, you ever eat one of my hamburgers?<br />- I've been lucky so far. I'll take a chance.
2627291 2630169 Yeah. Hey, Fast Eddie.
2630336 2632213 -How's business?<br />Booming. Can't you tell?
2632380 2633422 I'm looking at it.
2633589 2634966 - You meet my partner?<br />- No.
2635133 2637969 I wanna cook one<br />of those monster burgers for him.
2638136 2639387 - Go for it.<br />- All right.
2639554 2641556 -Gonna let him cook?<br />Do I have a choice?
2641722 2645184 No, because it's Wednesday.<br />Too big to argue with.
2645768 2647854 In that case, give me a McRog.
2648020 2649939 - Hold the hair.<br />- Heh, heh.
2650106 2651149 You wash your hands?
2651315 2654944 Keep joking, but I guarantee<br />you're gonna like this burger.
2655111 2658906 And you're gonna come back<br />with your friends.
2659073 2662702 I haven't got any friends,<br />you know that, Rog. Well, except you.
2662869 2664579 He's a comedian in his spare time.
2664745 2667415 Oh, yeah?<br />When is he gonna say something funny?
2667582 2671210 Hey, uh, you gonna put that out?<br />You're finished with it, yeah?
2671377 2673087 Do you mind, huh? Thanks.
2675423 2677258 Sorry. I was just looking at it.
2677675 2679343 Chew on this onion.<br />- Yeah.
2679510 2682388 - Yeah. He's quitting, so help him, okay?<br />- I quit.
2683097 2685099 I was only looking at it.
2687059 2689770 Ah. First thing is the fat.
2689937 2692440 Everybody says, "Cut the fat.”
2692607 2695276 My uncle said,<br />"You cut the fat, you kill the burger."
2695443 2697195 Yep.<br />There's an art to this.
2697361 2699405 You just can't plop this on the grill.
2702450 2705244 Gently coax the flavors out.
2706871 2708456 Yo, hey.<br />- What's the problem?
2715755 2719133 A little pepper,<br />then you massage it a little bit.
2719300 2722929 Just a little bit. Sweet, sweet meat.
2725973 2727600 Shit, man, feel it.
2731395 2734273 Okay, guys. L.A.P.D.<br />Let me see your hands.
2734732 2736943 Come on, let me see your hands.<br />Get them up!
2737109 2740571 In the car. Get them up there.<br />Let me see both of them. Come on!
2745201 2746827 Hey, Riggs.
2754752 2756128 Riggs!
2756754 2759257 God, don't you love me? Five days.
2767014 2768849 Don't do that shit to me.
2769016 2770434 -Riggs, you okay?<br />Yeah.
2770601 2772645 Come on. Who did it?
2774855 2777817 All right, asshole.<br />I wanna see your hands right now.
2804719 2806178 Back me up, Riggs!
2831954 2833706 Darryl?
2839378 2841756 Oh, fuck, no. Darryl!
2845051 2848721 Call an ambulance.<br />Riggs, call an ambulance. Breathe.
2849263 2851098 Breathe.
2851265 2852516 Breathe.
2852683 2854935 Call an ambulance, Riggs.
2855770 2857855 Hey, come on. Breathe. Oh, God.
2858022 2859690 Fuck, it's Darryl.
2860399 2861776 Darryl, breathe.
2861942 2863611 God, don't do this to me. Breathe.
2863778 2865446 - He's dead, Rog.<br />- Fucking breathe!
2865613 2868866 - Breathe! God, don't do this.<br />- He's dead, Rog.
2869033 2871410 He's dead, Rog. Rog, he's dead.
2871577 2873704 He's dead, Rog.<br />Don't mess with it, man.
2873871 2877458 He's dead. Come on, man,<br />it was a clean shoot.
2877625 2879502 It's okay, it was a clean shoot.
2879668 2881670 He was gonna do you,<br />he was gonna do me.
2882296 2883464 It's okay. You okay?
2884423 2886133 It's not okay.
2886467 2889136 - What?<br />- I know that kid.
2891472 2892765 I know that kid.
2894308 2896310 He's Nick's friend.
2913994 2915955 Got it, Mom.<br />I'll get it.
2916122 2919333 Hello? Hi, Martin.
2919750 2921252 He's not here.
2928551 2930636 Oh, my God.
2933222 2934849 Thanks.
2963794 2965713 Fuck. Fuck.
2971594 2973387 How you doing? Taking your vitamins?
2973554 2975681 - Riggs, how's Murtaugh?<br />- He's good. He's fine.
2975848 2977224 Morning, captain.
2977391 2980394 - I'm sure he's anything but fine.<br />- Really, he's okay.
2980561 2983606 - I'd really like to talk to him.<br />- I don't think that's a good idea.
2983772 2986358 I think the best thing you could do<br />is leave him alone.
2986525 2990070 - Let's, uh, get something for your cold.<br />- I know what I'm talking about, Riggs.
2991071 2994366 - You and I have to talk.<br />- Talking to you is bad for my image.
2994533 2996368 - I'm afraid I insist.<br />- Oh, you insist?
2996535 2998787 Well, in that case,<br />let's find somewhere private.
2998954 3001081 Here, step into my orifice.
3003792 3005419 Here.
3006837 3008339 Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?
3008506 3009757 Hey, Riggs.<br />Yeah.
3009924 3013552 Clip any wrong wires lately?<br />- No, I haven't done that for a couple days.
3013719 3015971 - Next time, wait for the bomb squad.<br />- Bomb squad.
3016138 3017223 Yeah, it's our job.
3017389 3020184 Okay, I'll remember that. We saved a cat.<br />What do you want?
3020351 3023062 - Great. I love cats.<br />- Hey.
3024188 3025814 Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.
3025981 3029777 You purposefully withheld information<br />concerning a case under my investigation.
3029944 3033322 - Yeah, damn right I did.<br />- Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
3033489 3036242 You had a tip on Travis,<br />you should have shared it with me.
3036408 3038035 No, I take that back.
3038202 3040788 You were required to share it with me.
3040955 3043332 - I was required to share it with you?<br />- Yeah.
3043499 3045459 I don't have to share shit with you.
3045626 3048879 Schoolyard rules: If you don't scratch<br />my back, I don't throw you...
3049046 3051799 - Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that.<br />- Yes, you can.
3051966 3054885 Why don't you cut out<br />this classified bullshit?
3055052 3057221 Right now. It's giving me the shits!
3057388 3060140 We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.<br />We're on the same side.
3060307 3061475 - Right? Right?<br />- Right!
3061642 3064728 Right? Good.<br />Why don't we start to act like it, huh?
3064895 3066814 Come on, there's kids out there. Babies.
3066981 3068983 No brains,<br />but they got automatic weapons.
3069149 3072278 - Yesterday, my partner, he nailed this kid...<br />- I know about Murtaugh.
3074196 3077157 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riggs.
3078117 3079702 Yeah.
3082621 3083998 Look, uh...
3084456 3086959 Look, why don't you let me in on this?<br />I can help you.
3087126 3090337 I really wanna help you, if you'll let me.<br />Let me.
3090504 3092590 Come on, what do you say?<br />We got a deal?
3096510 3097845 Wash your hands, Riggs.
3100431 3103309 And, um, meet me in my office.
3103642 3107146 Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll be right there.
3108981 3110024 Be right there.
3110899 3112651 MAC-10, 9 mm, semi-automatic...
3112818 3115946 - converted to automatic...<br />- With 36 rounds in the magazine.
3116113 3119783 On a sesame-seed bun. Very illegal.
3119950 3122870 - That gun has a history. Wanna know it?<br />- Tell me.
3126373 3129001 Killed a convenience-store clerk<br />in L.A. County, July 1990.
3129168 3133589 Was used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990.
3133756 3138719 Confiscated by a truant officer<br />of the L.A. School Board, October 1990.
3138886 3141513 Scheduled for destruction by the L.A.P.D.<br />six weeks ago.
3141680 3144141 - Scheduled for destruction?<br />- Yeah.
3144308 3146310 But it never got there.
3148354 3151315 Instead, it found its way into the hands<br />of a 15-year-old boy...
3151482 3153734 who fired on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3153901 3157237 - Thought it looked familiar.<br />- That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3157404 3161033 were stolen from a police storage<br />facility before they could be destroyed.
3161200 3164203 They should be paper clips right now<br />or license plates.
3164370 3167915 Anything but a gun. Here we are,<br />busting our asses on the streets...
3168082 3172294 to get these weapons out of circulation<br />and now they're headed right back out.
3172461 3175005 When you busted Phelps,<br />you stumbled onto something...
3175172 3177257 the department's<br />trying to keep a lid on.
3177424 3180803 That's why Internal Affairs is on this.<br />They think it's an inside job.
3180969 3183555 Yeah, that's right.<br />They knew police procedures.
3183722 3185974 They knew where the guns were<br />and how to get in.
3186141 3188435 They knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3188602 3191397 because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3191563 3194274 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />- Or an ex-cop.
3194566 3196610 - Right. Travis.<br />- Travis.
3199279 3201365 And you let him slip<br />through your fingers.
3202616 3206078 - That's closer than you ever got.<br />- Close, Riggs?
3206245 3209289 Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window.
3212000 3215421 - You wanna go for a ride?<br />- Sure, where we going?
3215796 3217381 Surprise.
3222052 3224138 Oh, I love surprises.
3224388 3225764 What is this place?
3225931 3228434 I accessed Billy Phelps'<br />phone records on my computer.
3228600 3230394 He made a dozen calls to this address.
3230561 3232730 Yeah?<br />Nice of you to steal that information.
3232896 3233939 Semantics, Riggs.
3234106 3237151 Semantics? I'm always up for some antics.
3237860 3242656 - All right, let's go on three. One...<br />- Uh, on three, or three and then go?
3242823 3244533 - What?<br />- Never mind. One, two, three.
3247911 3249329 Gotcha.
3263177 3265262 Looks like Billy's grandmother<br />owns a big dog.
3265429 3267014 That isn't a dog. That's a horse.
3267681 3269641 I hate dogs, Riggs.
3270267 3272478 - I don't get it.<br />- You don't get what?
3272644 3274605 That's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
3274772 3279818 No, I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window." I don't get that.
3279985 3281862 Riggs, later.
3286158 3288869 - What are you doing?<br />- Well, I can't shoot a dog.
3289036 3290704 People, okay, but not dogs.
3290871 3293332 I think I should try<br />and make friends with him.
3293499 3295834 - Make friends?<br />- Yeah.
3296001 3299713 Now, don't run, because he'll only<br />chase you down and kill you.
3299880 3301465 Uh-huh.
3302174 3305093 Here, boy. Here, boy.
3312518 3315229 - Here. Good boy. Yes.<br />- Shit.
3322569 3323821 Riggs.
3329201 3330494 You're crazy.
3350597 3353559 Want one? Want one?<br />You hungry? Huh?
3355269 3356770 You're a hungry boy.
3356937 3359273 Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
3359690 3361692 What a good fella.
3361859 3364152 Here. Here's more. Leave some for me.
3364319 3368282 Very slowly, as if you're not here,<br />just walk away.
3368448 3371535 - You want me to go?<br />- Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
3371702 3374496 Guy sort of thing?<br />Are you all alone in here?
3383797 3384965 Stay, stay.
3387092 3388802 Come on, let's go.
3399771 3401648 -Let's go. Let's go.<br />Watch.
3401815 3403150 On two.
3409990 3411867 -All right, how many is that?<br />Fifty-five.
3412034 3415329 Fifty-five. All right, we got eight more.
3415495 3417706 All right, we'll get these later. Let's go.
3421335 3424671 Hi, fellas. What's in all these boxes?
3435599 3439770 Easy, let's not kill him yet.<br />Let's see who he is first, all right?
3442147 3443690 You have the right to remain silent.
3443857 3445609 Shut him up.
3445776 3447986 Sergeant Martin Riggs, heh.
3450030 3452115 - Hubie, get the truck ready.<br />- Right.
3452282 3453784 So, Sergeant Riggs...
3453951 3455535 how did you find us?
3455702 3456995 Freeze. Police!
3458664 3459873 Oh, another one?
3460290 3461875 We need a new fucking dog.
3462042 3463877 Get your hands up, asshole.
3464044 3465879 Get them up.
3469174 3471385 A little bit higher. That's better.
3472886 3474513 Very good.
3478475 3480310 Drop it, miss.
3481979 3483230 Now, look...
3531278 3533739 Okay, I'm on. No, I'm not. I'm off! Wait!
3533905 3536575 Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
3540037 3543415 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Get down! Get down!
3546960 3548545 Get those cases and kill that dog.
3560766 3563143 Stop! The dog. Wait for the dog.
3563310 3566229 - Where'd you learn to fight?<br />- Catholic school. Forget the dog.
3566396 3569816 Here, boy. Come on. We're waiting<br />for the dog. Just hold it, hold it.
3569983 3573320 Hurry. Come on, dog.<br />Good dog. Good puppy. Go! Go!
3575822 3576990 Stop!
3577157 3578992 What? What?<br />- Guns.
3579159 3580285 -Full of guns.<br />Grab one.
3580452 3582162 - You grab one.<br />- You got friends?
3582329 3583789 Step on it!
3587501 3589503 Get that crate. Come on.
3595342 3597677 Hatchett, you said<br />not to worry about the police...
3597844 3599721 but the cops are all over you, man.
3599888 3602265 They got my guns.<br />They'll be coming after me next.
3602432 3604601 Far as I'm concerned, the deal's off.
3604768 3607938 Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone, all right?<br />We have a deal.
3608105 3609523 Nobody backs out.
3609689 3611691 You said you had the cops under control.
3611858 3615529 I see that isn't so. Give me one reason<br />why I should do business with you.
3615695 3619616 - I'll give you a real good reason.<br />- Hey, Tyrone, this is Travis.
3619783 3623912 You back out now, and I'll make certain that<br />only your dentist can identify the body.
3624079 3626373 Is that a good enough reason for you?
3628792 3630502 But I need ammo.
3630669 3632587 I'm out of business without ammo.
3632754 3636842 - I need the good stuff.<br />- You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3638051 3639761 "The good stuff.” Jesus. Pfft!
3639928 3642055 Time to pay another visit to the L.A.P.D.
3644224 3645934 You look like I feel.
3656236 3659281 Hey. Hey.
3659447 3661658 You got anything I can put on my head?
3661825 3663201 There's a hat in the closet.
3663368 3667956 You're all heart. Here I thought you were<br />gonna get all tender and maternal with me.
3668123 3670542 Listen, Riggs,<br />I was raised with four brothers.
3670709 3671960 We got hurt all the time...
3672127 3675380 but if no bones were broken<br />or blood wasn't gushing, nobody cared.
3675547 3677924 - Hey, look, blood. See? Blood.<br />- It's not gushing.
3678091 3680760 Well, it was free-flowing earlier.
3681136 3683096 Could you bring me<br />a needle and thread?
3683263 3686725 You know, maybe some peroxide.<br />I can patch it up myself.
3688768 3691688 - Don't touch anything.<br />- I wasn't. I didn't...
3693440 3695150 What's with you, anyway?
3710457 3713501 - The boys.<br />- Hey, what are you doing, huh?
3713668 3716296 - I told you not to touch anything.<br />- Uh, this came on by itself.
3716463 3718715 - Came on all by itself? You a wise guy?<br />- I swear.
3718882 3720800 You don't like to share your toys?
3720967 3722719 - This isn't a toy, Riggs.<br />- What is it?
3722886 3724638 - This is a weapon. Yeah.<br />- A weapon?
3724804 3726806 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3726973 3729267 What, do you throw it at people?<br />Pretty heavy.
3729434 3732145 You're gonna give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3732312 3733313 Right here.
3733480 3735649 - Okay, take a little off the top.<br />- Right here.
3741821 3744157 - You bring all your interrogations home?<br />- Okay.
3744324 3746785 - What are we talking about?<br />- Well, it's back here.
3746952 3748328 Careful. Careful.
3748495 3749996 - Careful. Oh.<br />- This?
3750163 3752666 - This scratch?<br />- Come on, it feels like Grand Canyon.
3752832 3754626 - Oh, God.<br />- Ah!
3754793 3756253 - Hold still.<br />- Yeah.
3756419 3760382 - Ah!<br />- Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3760548 3761800 Be gentle with me.
3762550 3765178 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3765345 3769224 Huh? Oh, that's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3769474 3772018 - That's a natural mistake.<br />- What, I have a wooden head?
3772185 3773478 - Look at that.<br />- It's a knife.
3773645 3775772 - Knife? That's very knife.<br />- Mm-hm.
3776064 3777107 This is all right.
3777274 3779693 Oh, that's pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw. Mm-hm.
3779859 3782862 Hey, that's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this, huh?
3783029 3785031 Same damn thing. Third and Highland.
3785198 3788118 - Dragged for about half a block.<br />- That's a good one.
3788285 3790453 Feel that texture. Feel it.<br />Cheese-grater time.
3790620 3792706 - Moving truck.<br />- Moving truck? Ooh!
3792872 3794291 - Moving bullet.<br />- Moving bullet?
3794457 3796209 - Here. This is the best.<br />- Bullets now.
3796960 3799796 - It goes all the way to the back.<br />- Oh, hey. Right through?
3799963 3801548 You're lucky. What is it, .227?
3801715 3803216 - It's a .38, Riggs.<br />- That's a .387
3803383 3806219 - It's a .38.<br />- That's a wimpy .38. This is a .38.
3806386 3809306 - Yours is bigger than mine? Don't think so.<br />- I think so.
3809472 3810724 Maybe not, but look. Watch.
3810890 3814060 A whole family of .44s on the back.
3814227 3816313 - Look, there they are.<br />- Impressive.
3816479 3819858 One got stuck in my lung.<br />I was breathing blood bubbles. Disgusting.
3820025 3821318 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3821484 3823361 - You got one?<br />- Mm.
3823528 3825155 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3825447 3826906 - Oh, yeah.<br />- Mm-hm.
3827449 3830160 - Yeah. Right down here. Went through.<br />- Oh.
3830327 3831536 - That must've hurt.<br />- Right.
3831703 3832746 - Not too close.<br />- Pfft!
3832912 3834831 Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
3834998 3837751 I can beat it. I can beat it.<br />Have a look at this.
3837917 3840170 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- You gotta see this.
3840337 3843089 - I'll take your word.<br />- This guy had a knife. You'll love it.
3843256 3845884 He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3846301 3848928 - Hurt like a son of a bitch.<br />- I'll take your word for it.
3849095 3850221 No, I said forget it.
3850388 3853308 - This is a blue-ribbon event.<br />- Forget it, Riggs.
3854392 3855435 Hey, you started this.
3855602 3858271 - Yeah, well, I can end it.<br />- You know what?
3858730 3860106 You're a very poor loser.
3861566 3862776 I didn't lose, Riggs.
3862942 3864694 - Yes, you did.<br />- No. No, I didn't lose.
3864861 3866446 - You lost.<br />- I conceded.
3866613 3869032 There's a difference between<br />losing and conceding.
3869199 3870867 You conceded or you're conceited?
3871034 3873119 - You think I'm conceited?<br />- Oh, yeah.
3873286 3875455 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3875622 3876664 I'll get a Band-Aid.
3876831 3879959 - Tell me you lost.<br />- I said, don't touch anything.
3891679 3894224 You're gonna smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
3895100 3897018 I can do better than that, Riggs.
3914119 3917497 This could be<br />a serious ethical breach here.
3917789 3919958 I never made it<br />with another sergeant before.
3920125 3921793 Shut up, Riggs.
3976723 3978224 Oh!

4890511 4892429 - That's a lot of woman there.<br />- Shit.
4892596 4896308 She calls me all the time. And she leaves<br />me notes. What am I gonna do?
4896475 4899978 - You shouldn't have led her on.<br />- Led her on? I didn't do anything, Riggs.
4900145 4904149 I mean, if Trish finds out about it...<br />I didn't... I didn't...
4904483 4907152 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4907319 4909947 You've gotta come see me.
4910114 4912366 Well, we gotta work. Come on. Let's go.
4912533 4915452 - Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />- Yeah. Thanks, doc.
4915702 4916954 -You're a beauty.<br />Coming?
4917121 4918997 A beauty. Yeah, I'm coming.
4926588 4928507 Afternoon, captain.
4930175 4933303 That's good, Murphy.<br />See how easy that was?
4937307 4939059 I love it down here, don't you, Murph?
4939226 4943480 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4947192 4949027 Give me the lock-up keys.
4949570 4952364 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
4952531 4954533 And all busted by<br />the same police officer...
4954700 4956785 Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
4956952 4958704 Early paroles<br />on the work furlough program.
4958871 4962374 Uh-huh. Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4962541 4965294 Just a minute. You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4965461 4966712 - What?<br />- May I see your pass?
4966879 4968672 - Wanna see? Here's my pass.<br />- I do.
4968839 4971425 - I got shot in the line of duty, okay?<br />- He's with us.
4971592 4973135 - He's with us?<br />- Did I say that?
4973302 4976555 - Where'd you get her from?<br />- What are you doing out of the hospital?
4976722 4979224 Don't mention the hospital.<br />I told you not to leave me.
4979391 4981977 They tried to take my appendix.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4982144 4984104 - Brain surgery?<br />- No, a lapotomy.
4984271 4986565 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4986732 4987774 What's the difference?
4987941 4992029 The difference is, when you get a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4992196 4995365 - Nether what?<br />- Your nether... I can't say it in front of her.
4995532 4996992 Well, point to it.
4998452 4999745 - Okay. Here.<br />- Must be itchy.
4999912 5002331 Yes, it is itchy.<br />These doctors are savages.
5002498 5005584 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
5005751 5007252 Huh? Huh?
5008629 5011089 Yeah. With a telescope<br />big enough to see Venus.
5011256 5012925 I guess all they saw was Uranus, huh?
5013091 5015260 Oh, that's great. Huh-huh.<br />That's great. Thank you.
5015427 5016845 - You know what I say?<br />- What?
5017012 5020766 They fuck you in the hospital!<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you.
5020933 5022142 And when they're done...
5022309 5025395 along comes the insurance company,<br />and fucks you some more.
5025562 5028607 Ten dollars for a fucking aspirin,<br />that's not even covered.
5028774 5030067 - Leo!<br />- That's enough.
5030234 5031777 - We're trying to work here.<br />- Okay.
5031944 5034780 What's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5034947 5036532 You take an ad out in the paper?
5036698 5039284 - He's family. We gotta go somewhere else.<br />- Who's she?
5039451 5041578 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Hey, how are you? Leo Getz.
5041745 5043455 Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?
5043622 5045582 - I get it.<br />- Real estate right now but...
5045749 5048085 Hey, listen. Come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
5048252 5050420 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
5050587 5052172 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5052339 5055634 That's great. I take one for you,<br />and that's what you tell me?
5055801 5059137 - He could check this out.<br />- That's all I'm good for? Takes slugs...
5059304 5061932 Leo, Leo, Leo. Look.<br />We got something for you to do.
5062099 5065602 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
5065769 5068480 - Okay. Sure, I can do this.<br />- Remember that name?
5068647 5070482 Right around... Mesa Verde, I got it.
5070649 5072985 What are you doing giving him<br />Mesa Verde?
5073151 5074987 If there's shit there, he'll dig it up.
5075153 5077030 -Who is that guy?<br />It's a long story.
5083328 5084746 Here are your keys, captain.
5086164 5087874 - You motherfucker.<br />- Don't be stupid.
5088041 5090627 The fuck?<br />- Take the elevator, bring the other guys.
5090794 5092588 Keys. Give me your fucking hands.
5093589 5097134 Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.
5097801 5099886 Stand there.
5103307 5105809 I can get faster results<br />than that real-estate broker.
5105976 5108729 Leo's not just a real-estate broker.
5108895 5111773 Yeah, he's a royal pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5112816 5116403 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator, guys.
5116570 5118905 - How'd you know where to find them?<br />- We got it all.
5119072 5121199 World of computers, Murph.<br />World of computers.
5121366 5124036 You used to be one of us,<br />for Christ sakes, Jack.
5124202 5127289 You know what future<br />a cop has, Murph? None.
5127456 5130542 Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
5130792 5132085 Pension.
5132586 5133629 Nothing to do.
5133795 5137215 Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain<br />by evening. Well, not for this kid.
5137382 5139509 Police department's got it all:
5139676 5142846 Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.<br />It's a one-stop shopping center.
5143013 5146391 If you got the brains, there's not<br />a thing anybody can do about it.
5146558 5149227 You're already fucking history<br />and you know it.
5149394 5151730 Sorry, Murph.<br />But I'm just getting started.
5152230 5154232 Something's wrong here.<br />What?
5154399 5156860 The program's been accessed<br />by somebody from the outside.
5157027 5158528 What? What's been accessed?
5158695 5162282 After the guns were stolen, Internal<br />Affairs moved the confiscated ammunition.
5162449 5164660 - Armor-piercing bullets?<br />- Thousands of rounds...
5164826 5167412 to a more secured location. Shit.
5167579 5169456 - That's been accessed.<br />- Somebody knows.
5169623 5171833 Where's it stored?<br />Where did they move it?
5173168 5174670 Wait, wait.<br />Let's go.
5174836 5178298 - I guess I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.<br />- Where is it?
5178465 5179758 In the building.<br />Where?
5179925 5181677 I'm showing you.<br />Something going down?
5181843 5183804 - Nothing's going down.<br />- I'm going with you.
5183970 5185764 - Uh, how old are you?<br />- Twenty-two today.
5185931 5189267 Twenty-two? Come on.<br />You got protection?
5189434 5192187 - Right here in my wallet.<br />- No, your vest, you dummy.
5192354 5193438 Should we take him?
5193605 5196149 Okay, but keep your head down.<br />Keep your head down.
5196316 5197796 - Stay behind me.<br />- Come on, let's go.
5197901 5199111 Yahoo!<br />- Shh! Quiet.
5211456 5213083 See, you were my ticket in, Murph.
5213667 5216294 It's too bad<br />you won't be coming with me.
5220424 5221675 Travis.
5221842 5223677 They got it all.<br />Shit.
5224386 5226346 - He's dead.<br />- How'd they get it out of here?
5226513 5228974 - I don't know.<br />- They didn't take it upstairs.
5229141 5231101 Hey, hey. Elevator.
5233687 5236314 - Shit. It's down.<br />- Hey, the subway's down there.
5236481 5238400 -We take the stairs.<br />L.A. has subways?
5238567 5239609 Where you been, kid?
5239776 5241653 Read something besides the funny pages.
5242696 5245157 All right, guys. Come on, let's hustle.
5247701 5249494 Hurry up, guys.
5262174 5263592 L.A.P.D., guys. Come here.
5263759 5265635 Come here. Step on it.
5266261 5267929 Son of a bitch.
5268096 5269890 You see anybody, anything strange?
5270056 5274603 - Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.<br />- Split now. Just get out of here.
5275020 5276688 -I'm going across.<br />I got it.
5283779 5285572 Get rid of Murphy, now!
5291286 5293371 Where the fuck do you think you're going?<br />Let's go.
5305759 5307135 Split. Get out of here.
5308929 5310472 Cover me.
5316311 5317646 Riggs!
5330659 5332410 Let's go. Let's go!
5336289 5338166 Riggs.
5341670 5343588 Son, stay still.
5353598 5355725 Happy birthday, kid.
5365443 5366611 Oh, shit!
5381418 5382794 Another baby.
5395181 5397142 Hey! Is he dead? Check the body.
5397309 5398977 Get me the fuck out of here, will you?
5400645 5402439 Hey, Riggs! Hey, Riggs!
5402731 5405150 Riggs! You stupid son of a bitch.
5417078 5419164 Stop that shit. Cut it out.
5419331 5421166 -Hey! Don't shoot.<br />L.A.P.D., man.
5421333 5422584 Where does this come out?
5422751 5424127 - Pico Station.<br />- Thanks, pal.
5424294 5425337 Hey, not that way.
5425503 5428256 -Take the stairs, man, it's faster.<br />Okay, thanks.
5439059 5440185 Ow!
5440352 5442562 Sorry, pal. Where's the tunnel?<br />Gangway!
5450528 5452322 Get out of the way.
5455325 5457869 Holy shit. Son of a bitch.
5458703 5459913 Police!
5466878 5468964 Step on it! There he is! Step on it!
5470590 5472050 Goddamn.
5476888 5478848 Put your foot down!
5484896 5486564 I can't!
5505917 5509254 - Hey, police! I need your bike, man.<br />- What? This is bullshit.
5509421 5513883 I need your bike. Sergeant Riggs,<br />call it in. I need a couple clips too.
5529357 5531109 Hey, we lost him.
5538241 5540368 -Central, where's Riggs?<br />Six-William-Six.
5540535 5542871 Central, keep me in touch<br />with motorcycle pursuit.
5550462 5552130 -Shit.<br />Take a right, now.
5552297 5553715 Take a right! Go!
5554466 5556301 Go! Go! Go!
5557302 5559596 Stupid. Take a right. No, left!
5571149 5572150 Shit!
5577113 5578281 Oh, shit!
5594631 5596341 Watch it!
5600428 5602472 This is 6-William-6, this is 6-William-6.
5602639 5604349 I'm at the freeway construction site.
5604516 5607393 Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?<br />Come back to me, Central.
5607560 5609312 Six-William-Six, location west...
5609479 5611039 Where's Riggs? Where the hell is Riggs?
5612607 5615151 Take a left here. Get off.<br />Get off the freeway.
5616528 5617779 Oh, Jesus!
5627539 5628540 Stop! Hold it!
5630375 5631459 Oh, shit!
5632335 5633753 Hang on.
5636047 5637215 Stop!
5648977 5650019 Where is the pursuit?
5654315 5655733 Oh, shit.
5668121 5672250 - Riggs! Hey, just relax, Riggs.<br />- Relax?
5674002 5675211 Riggs! Riggs!
5675545 5678173 Oh, shit!
5684220 5685930 Riggs! Riggs!
5689559 5692770 Riggs. Hey, Riggs.
5692979 5695106 Get back. Just get back. Get back!
5695773 5698109 Riggs, talk to me. Riggs.
5698276 5701029 Riggs, you're alive. Come here.
5701196 5704282 Don't move. Don't move.<br />I said just get back!
5705116 5706451 You all right?
5708786 5710496 Hey, hey, hey, Riggs, don't...
5710663 5712040 Hey, hey, Riggs!
5713583 5714751 Don't touch me!
5714918 5717795 Okay, okay. I'm not touching you.<br />I'm not touching you.
5717962 5720215 - Just be careful.<br />- Don't touch me. Don't!
5724260 5727055 - Don't touch me.<br />- Hey, okay, I won't touch you.
5727222 5728389 I'm not touching you.
5730850 5735647 - Okay. You okay now?<br />- I'm pissed now, Rog. Now I'm pissed.
5735813 5737315 - Now what?<br />- That son of a bitch.
5737482 5739400 He's done it twice now. Damn.
5739567 5742445 Son of a... I'm gonna suck<br />his eyes out through his nose.
5742695 5744822 Twice he got away.<br />Nobody gets away from me!
5744989 5747825 Okay. Just relax. Just relax.
5748159 5749994 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
5750161 5752664 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
5755375 5756668 Hey!
5757252 5758753 - Hey, I'm having that.<br />- You quit!
5758920 5761130 I ran out of biscuits, all right?<br />Give me a break.
5762840 5764300 Oh, shit.
5765510 5766678 Oh, shit.
5771349 5772517 Perfect.
5773601 5775770 -What did I miss?<br />What's he doing here?
5775937 5778147 - What are you doing here?<br />- Great car chase.
5778314 5780275 - Great chase.<br />- What are you doing here?
5780441 5782277 - How'd you find us, huh?<br />- My police scanner.
5782443 5784445 What are you doing<br />with a police scanner?
5784612 5788950 What am I...? Hello, Car 54, where are you?<br />I cracked this case for you guys.
5789117 5791452 Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.
5791619 5793997 They got a housing project<br />called Rancho Arroyo.
5794163 5796624 I know where that is.<br />- Why don't we check it out?
5796791 5799419 - Good idea.<br />- Okay, hey, wait. I'll come with you.
5799585 5802422 - No, you're not coming.<br />- Yes, I am. I'll take my car.
5802588 5804382 -No, you're not.<br />Yes, I am.
5806134 5809262 I can't believe you did that.<br />I got a spare in the trunk.
5812223 5813891 - You're driving.<br />- No, I'm driving.
5814058 5816769 How could you do that?<br />I can't believe you did that.
5816936 5819397 -I can't believe you did that.<br />Hey, where's Lorna?
5819564 5821733 -I can't believe you did that.<br />With Walters.
5822400 5825153 I can't belie... I can't<br />believe you did that.
5825320 5827488 How could you do that to me?
5828573 5830742 Did you see that? They're my partners.
5830908 5833578 - I can't believe they did that.<br />- Twenty-one and 18, clear.
5833745 5835079 Excuse me, do you own your home?
5868946 5871616 - Looks like we came to the right place.<br />- Yeah.
5871783 5873618 Move on out to Travis Town.
5873785 5876037 Great place to raise a family.
5876537 5878706 Built on guns and bloodshed.
5878873 5881584 One hell of a retirement plan<br />this asshole's got, isn't it?
5881751 5884128 Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.
5884712 5887173 - Say, is that, uh...?<br />- It's Darryl's gun.
5887340 5890009 - Saving it for the right occasion.<br />- This is the right occasion.
5890176 5892095 How many men you think he has?
5892261 5894639 Who knows? Maybe I should<br />run over there and ask him?
5894806 5896349 - That'd be too easy.<br />- Yeah.
5896557 5898643 Wish I had some grenades<br />or a rocket launcher.
5898810 5900603 Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
5900770 5903689 Hey, I wonder what Murphy's got<br />in his trunk.
5905983 5908444 Well, it's obvious Murph was<br />never a Boy Scout.
5908903 5910488 - Not even a good spare.<br />- Yeah.
5912156 5913491 Shit.
5914575 5916327 Put your hands down. It's embarrassing.
5919622 5921749 - How you doing?<br />- Kissing, huh?
5921916 5925253 - Fresh ones, huh?<br />- Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.
5925420 5926712 Don't get points for those.
5926879 5928756 - How did you get here?<br />- Drove.
5928923 5931426 - No, no. How...?<br />- I ran into Leo at the police station.
5931592 5933136 - He talked to me first.<br />- Leo, Leo.
5933302 5935346 Any ideas?<br />Lucky thing we got a plan.
5935513 5937348 Yeah.<br />- Yeah, lucky thing. What is it?
5937515 5942437 - Oh, no. I want it to be a surprise.<br />- Oh, I like surprises.
5947275 5948609 Move it!
5950695 5953239 - Let's check it out.<br />- Let's go.
5970173 5972758 - Look what they did to Murph's car.<br />- Could've been worse.
5972925 5975178 -Could've been yours.<br />Could've been Trish's.
5977305 5978347 - On three.<br />- Three.
5978514 5979557 - Three?<br />- Yeah, three.

6323317 6324902 Killed in the line of duty, Riggs!
6329365 6332243 You'll get a great funeral<br />from the department, Riggs!
6337581 6339917 Hey, Riggs. Cop killers.
6352054 6353597 Ex-cop killers.
6364066 6365776 Go to hell, Riggs.
6367111 6368487 You first.
6377371 6380124 Hey, Riggs! Crazy son of a bitch.
6386338 6388841 Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.

6393304 6395347 Hey, get a chopper, man. Get a chopper.
6395639 6397725 She had two vests on.<br />She's gonna be okay.
6397892 6400102 A couple of bad ones.<br />We need to get a chopper.
6400269 6404148 Okay. You're all right, partner.<br />You're all right. All right. Hang on. Okay.
6404773 6407735 It's okay, it's okay.<br />Just lie still. Just lie still.
6407902 6411113 Just a romantic evening<br />by the fire, just the two of us.
6411363 6412573 Just be still.
6415868 6419330 Lock and load!<br />I got it.
6422625 6425127 Honey, open your eyes. Open your eyes.
6425794 6427338 Open your eyes.
6430841 6432843 What are you trying to prove<br />out there, huh?
6433218 6434637 Huh? Why do you do that?
6435304 6437056 -Can I take this off?<br />Yeah.
6439099 6441060 You're supposed to grow old<br />with someone...
6441226 6442853 not because of them, all right?
6448984 6450361 I'm gonna be with you, Lorna.
6451153 6453155 Hey, I'm with you now.<br />Look, I'm right here.
6453322 6455366 We're both here, right? Right.

6459370 6461246 What have you got to lose?
6462164 6463207 You.
6465334 6466669 Not likely.
6472132 6474343 - Hey, Lorna.<br />- Yeah?
6476595 6478681 Let's live to regret this, huh?
6482601 6484645 Okay, we've gotta go, sarge.<br />- Okay.
6485187 6486897 She's gonna be fine.
6490609 6492027 Can you hear me?
6493529 6494571 I love you.
6512172 6516176 Happy retirement, Daddy
6517094 6520973 Happy retirement, Daddy
6521432 6523600 This is it. This is the day.
6524476 6525561 Everybody? Daddy?
6525728 6528856 I want you to know there's a candle<br />for every year in the force.
6529023 6530816 -Yes. A lot of years.<br />That's a lot.
6530983 6532985 Come on, you have to blow it out.<br />Come on.
6533152 6535738 Blow them out.<br />Blow them out. Come on.
6535904 6537281 - I can't.<br />- Come on, we'll help.
6537448 6541243 -No, that's not what I mean.<br />What?
6541744 6543620 I can't retire.
6544663 6546832 I thought I could. I wanted to.
6548250 6549793 But I can't.
6553630 6555632 That means you're gonna<br />stay with the force?
6555799 6557968 That means I'm staying<br />with the force, baby.
6561346 6565476 This cake's about to explode,<br />so, uh, you better blow out these candles.
6565642 6569354 But, um, Dad, I want you to know<br />that I'm behind you all the way.
6570022 6571899 Yeah, me too.<br />So am I, Dad.
6572066 6574318 - It's okay.<br />- Well, the streets will be safer...
6574485 6575605 for another couple years.
6578405 6581116 - Word, Nick.<br />- Word, Dad.
6584203 6585746 Blow them out.
6586789 6587956 Hello?
6588123 6590334 Hello. Up here!<br />Hello?
6590501 6593921 -Hello. Hey, I gotta talk to Roger.<br />Leo.
6594088 6595172 Oprah should see this.
6595339 6597841 I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.
6598008 6599468 Leo, what is it?
6599635 6602638 Where's Riggs? I didn't know<br />he could hold his breath that long.
6602805 6604848 - Okay, okay.<br />- I'm taking a bath, Leo.
6605015 6607976 I can see that. And it's cold water too.<br />There goes your image.
6608143 6611063 Leo.<br />Listen, I got great news, okay?
6611230 6614399 Okay? Once again,<br />Leo Getz has delivered.
6614566 6616693 Okay, I have sold this turkey.
6617569 6621990 This termite-infested dump<br />is now gone. Okay?
6622157 6625536 You have to sign the contract<br />before the suckers change their mind.
6625702 6626912 Okay? I did it. I did it.
6627079 6628539 Hey, hey. Leo, Leo.<br />- What?
6628705 6630207 The house is off the market.
6630374 6634336 We're gonna stay in this termite-infested<br />turkey for another 10 years.
6634503 6636463 At least.<br />I'll get married in here.
6636630 6639133 Come on, you guys. Come on, out.<br />You can't do this.
6639299 6641093 Out, out.<br />No, you can't do that.
6641260 6643887 You too, Leo.<br />You can't do that.
6644054 6645222 I have contracts signed.
6645389 6647641 Because we're partners,<br />no commission. Okay?
6647808 6651353 - Partners?<br />- You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
6651520 6652563 Why?<br />- Why?
6652729 6655399 Bullets aren't covered in normal<br />road hazard. That's why.
6655566 6659236 - I want those tires! No conditions!<br />- Oh, God. Leo, get out of here.
6659403 6661905 - Don't tell me to get out!<br />- Get out. Leo, out, out!
6662072 6664199 You're lucky your wife's here.<br />You're lucky...
6664366 6665409 Out!<br />Okay.
6668620 6670914 - Don't come to me if the...<br />- Get out!
6671081 6673959 Termites get... Okay, okay.<br />No more!
6676461 6679256 - Your friends.<br />- Yeah.
6679715 6682634 Ten more years<br />till forced retirement, huh, baby?
6683802 6687973 That's, uh, 3650 days.
6688140 6690934 - Forty-nine.<br />- Oh, yeah.
6701737 6703822 - I'll try and improve my image.<br />- Mm.
6710746 6714625 -See you soon. Thanks a lot.<br />Don't mention it.
6714791 6716793 Oh, bye, Daddy.
6719129 6720631 Bye, baby.
6729806 6732351 - What are you smiling at?<br />- Heh.
6732517 6735687 - Why weren't you at my party, huh?<br />- I knew you weren't gonna retire.
6735854 6739608 I've been wrong about a couple things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
6739775 6741944 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6742110 6744738 I'm smoking to take my mind off<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6744905 6747950 - What dog-biscuit problem?<br />- I've been chasing more cars lately...
6748116 6751161 and, uh, when I try and lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
6751662 6755457 Jesus Christ. Hey, hey, hey.<br />I'm driving. Other side.
6755624 6758543 I got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.
6758710 6760212 Thank you for opening the door.
6760379 6763882 - Need some help? An old fella like you...<br />- I'll show you a fella my age.
6764049 6765969 - Who's a grumpy bastard?<br />- I'm a grumpy bastard.
6767302 6768845 - You know something, Riggs?<br />- What?
6769012 6772766 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.
6773308 6776853 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.
6777020 6778355 Well, he did it to me.
6779439 6780857 I know.
6781608 6783068 See what I mean?
6785195 6788448 - My point, exactly.<br />- Son of a bitch. Shit.
6791743 6793245 Stay away from my daughter.
6793412 6795706 You can't be serious.<br />What are you talking about?
6795872 6797708 I saw what it was. You kissed Rianne.
6797874 6799710 She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6799876 6802838 That's not the point.<br />It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6803005 6805632 If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
6805799 6808844 Getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />I'm getting enough fiber.
6809011 6810387 I'm spoken for, okay?
6810554 6813181 I'm gonna pick Lorna up<br />from the hospital this afternoon.
6813348 6815225 Yeah?<br />Yeah, we're practically...
6815392 6817811 You're serious?<br />We got a dog and everything.
6817978 6820605 I figure I can, uh, you know,<br />make ends meet.
6829239 6832409 All units. All units. Code 2, high.
6832576 6835203 Hey, don't even think<br />about it, Riggs. Don't even try.
6835370 6838498 This is us, rolling to Code 2, high,<br />at Verrina Place.
6838665 6841460 Shit, Riggs.<br />This time we wait for the bomb squad.
6841626 6844212 You think I want to end up<br />in uniform again?
7026811 7030982 20-William-12,<br />the REA bomb squad's en route. All units.
7031149 7032943 Those guys gonna get in the way again?
7033109 7035904 Okay, there it is. You happy? Let's go.
7036071 7038073 Ah, we ain't seen nothing yet, though, Rog.
7038240 7040784 -Come on, just get me up there closer.<br />It's roped off.
7040951 7043328 Can't see the bomb squad.<br />They're coming.
7043495 7046456 Okay, all right. All right.<br />Stop here and I'll just get out.
7046623 7049376 No, don't get out<br />of the car, Riggs. No. Riggs!
7049543 7051836 Tell me, Rog, was it red wire, blue...?
7052087 7054297 Let's get out of here!<br />Step on the gas.
7054464 7055882 They'll never believe this.
7056049 7058635 I hope nobody saw us.<br />They'll blame me.
7058802 7062055 Let's keep cool. You better get<br />your girdle out of mothballs.
7062222 7064057 They'll say, "Back in uniform again."
7064224 7066851 Find one that fits.<br />Ten more years of this.
7067018 7067978 I'm too old for this shit.
7067979 7069980 I'm too old for this shit.
