107148 108525 Riggs, Homicide.
108692 110193 - Nobody's dead.<br />- The night's young.
110276 112195 This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
112237 113780 - Threat or scare?<br />- Real thing.
113863 115490 He saw a device.
115657 118993 It's on Level 1, by the gas pumps.<br />I wrote the license plate number.
119077 120912 That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
120995 123331 - You evacuated the building?<br />- It's clean.
123373 124958 - Where's the bomb squad?<br />- Coming.
125041 127419 Good. It's under control. Let's go.
127502 129879 I think we ought to check this out.
131006 132173 What?
132590 134884 - Bomb squad's coming.<br />- There's no bomb!
134968 137554 - How do you know?<br />- Because it's a full moon.
137721 140098 Moon, lunar, lunatics.<br />They're everywhere.
140181 141933 - Is that Greek?<br />- Latin.
142434 144436 You surprise the shit out of me.
144519 146855 There's no bomb.<br />It's probably a false alarm.
147063 149482 It happens. He probably saw<br />a radio on the back seat.
149899 152527 Let's not mess with it.<br />Wait for the bomb squad.
152610 155613 You're right. You sit tight,<br />I'll be right back.
156197 157907 What's the matter with you?
157991 160410 - There's a bomb in there!<br />- No, there's not.
160493 162287 - There's a bomb in there!<br />- There is not!
162370 163621 There's a bomb in there!
163705 165457 - Know how I know?<br />- How?
165540 168960 I got eight days to retirement<br />and I won't make a stupid mistake.
169044 172255 There is no bomb!<br />I'll bet vital anatomy parts!
172464 173465 Look.
174841 176217 Trust me. Okay?
180972 183350 That's usually my first mistake.
185435 187354 Hey, wait. I'm coming.
187687 188897 Rog?
189064 191733 - Your insurance paid up?<br />- Of course. Why?
192192 195070 - There could be a bomb in here.<br />- Oh, God!
197947 201743 - I hate it when I'm right.<br />- Learn to trust your instincts more.
201826 202994 Oh, God.
203870 206831 First impression can often be<br />the right one.
209793 211836 Drive shaft... I wonder if there's a bomb.
211920 213838 Just don't touch it.
215256 216716 Just looking.
222305 226184 What are you doing?<br />Don't open the door! Don't!
230480 232565 Son of a bitch, just look at it.
232732 234734 That's all I'll do, just look.
238071 240407 There's more plastic than Cher.
240824 243076 I love this job. It's amateur night.
243159 244369 Open the door. I can't hear you.
244828 246454 Open the door.
246830 248289 Don't do nothing.
249624 251167 Not that one!
251459 252961 You son of a bitch.
253003 256131 This is a pretty shonky job.<br />I can dismantle it.
256256 258842 It looks like Beirut to me. Let's go!
262679 266391 Everybody's outside. Just me, you<br />and the cat are dumb enough to be here.
266474 268935 Nearly a "cat-tastrophe," huh?
270020 271938 - Relax, Rog. Relax.<br />- Right.
272147 273023 Don't do nothing.
273106 276651 We got 9 minutes and 7 seconds left.<br />You know what we can do?
277193 278528 We could drive it out.
278611 280238 Fine, it's your turn to drive.
280321 282365 No keys. I could hot-wire it.
283241 285827 Don't even say "hot-wire"<br />around this stuff!
285910 286911 You're right.
286995 289039 Why am I doing this? Why?
289289 292292 I'm going to have to do it<br />the old-fashioned way.
292459 294127 What are you thinking?
294419 296212 What are you thinking?
297464 299883 - I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.<br />- Wait!
299966 302010 - That's not what I think.<br />- You think maybe the red?
302093 303511 No! No!
303595 306431 I'm thinking it's eight minutes<br />and 42 seconds.
306514 310143 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, have a cappuccino.
310226 314147 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />And it's 8 minutes, 31 seconds.
314230 315440 Rog, please.
315732 316733 Forget the cappuccino.
316816 320320 - You know what they'll say?<br />- "Get the fuck out of here!"
320570 323782 But then, "Cut the blue wire,"<br />which I'll do right now.
325200 327369 - Wait, wait!<br />- What?
327452 328703 How can you be so sure?
328745 329913 It's just a hunch.
329996 330997 A hunch?!
331206 332749 Remember the toilet bomb?
332832 335877 - How could I forget?<br />- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
335960 339172 This is more simplified,<br />but a bit more powerful.
339381 341383 From where I sat, I couldn't see.
341466 343009 Forget it. Come on, trust me.
343093 344427 Trust you?
344594 347263 Guess not. I'm cutting the red wire, okay?
350141 351351 What? What?
351476 353687 A minute ago you said blue!
354688 355647 I did?
355730 357023 You said blue!
357607 359192 - I meant red.<br />- Sure?
359567 361194 We can do it your way.
361277 363530 - My way?! I don't have...<br />- Quiet!
363738 364864 I'm sure, okay?
364948 366324 Ah, shit!
369369 370370 Ready?
371454 372205 Rog?
372288 373289 What?
373832 376835 Won't you miss all this good stuff<br />when you retire?
377210 379379 Won't you miss it a little bit?
382424 384092 I'm cutting the wire.
384509 386511 Snip. All done.
391725 392892 Grab the cat!
392934 394352 Grab the cat?!
394436 396646 Get out of there!<br />Take cover!
460168 461544 Where are they?
467175 468176 Bravo.
473723 474766 Oops.
476810 478770 Right. Oops.
481231 483316 Right.
488530 491700 Seven days to retirement,<br />I'm busted down to patrolman.
491783 493868 I should've cut the red wire.
494369 496788 - You did.<br />- No, I cut the blue wire.
496871 498623 That's what I meant.
498790 502085 - We should've waited for the bomb squad.<br />- Must I hear this every day?
502168 505213 - Every day until I retire!<br />- That's a week too long.
506631 508967 - My feet are killing me.<br />- They're killing me, too.
509050 511678 - How?<br />- Listening to you bitch about them!
511761 515348 - Because you should've cut the red wire!<br />- I did!
516933 517892 What's this?
518059 520103 Kind of soft. Not a bulletproof vest.
520186 521604 It won't keep anything out.
521688 523606 It's to keep my stomach in.
523648 525567 What do you got under there?
526359 527652 It's a girdle.
527944 528945 What?
530363 531614 It's a girdle!
532449 533616 Does Trish know?
533700 535994 This is not a woman's girdle.<br />It's a man's girdle!
536036 538371 - Man's girdle?<br />- They make girdles for men!
538455 539956 - They do?<br />- Yeah, they do!
540040 541875 I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years!
541916 545462 - Cleaners must have shrunk it.<br />- You should take it to Chin.
545503 549341 I did take it to Chin. Look at it.<br />It's shrunk all up in here.
549674 551426 I have to hold my breath.
551509 552761 Did you see that?
552802 554637 - See what?<br />- Jaywalker.
555847 557057 Jaywalking?
557766 560060 Hold it right there, pal.<br />Step up here, please.
560143 561519 - Me?<br />- Yes, you.
561686 563271 - What'd I do?<br />- Stand there.
563355 566441 Jaywalking. I saw you.<br />I'll have to cite you.
566566 569235 Jaywalking?! Oh, Jesus, come on!
569402 572989 - Should I radio for backup?<br />- Smart ass. Got the ticket book?
573198 575742 You're hassling me for...
575825 577452 Shut up!
580997 584542 - Do you know how to fill one of these out?<br />- A long time ago.
585001 588463 I can't read it. The print is too small<br />without my glasses.
589130 592467 Can we speed this up?<br />You may have nothing to do, but I do.
592676 595261 No, we can't, so will you shut up?
596054 598223 - Jaywalking.<br />- Ask for his license.
598306 600225 - License, for jaywalking?<br />- Yeah.
600308 603353 I don't have it on me. I wasn't driving.
603436 606272 I was walking.<br />Do I need a walking license now?
606398 608400 - Let's just shoot him!<br />- Is he crazy?
608483 611569 I'm going to drill him!<br />We'll make it look like suicide!
611653 614698 - Get out of the way!<br />- No, the video cameras!
614739 616658 I don't care! I'll drill him!
616741 618451 Get out of here, before he kills you!
618535 621663 - Go that way! Not that way!<br />- This way! Over here!
621705 622747 Run! Now!
622872 624833 Run!
635635 637095 Wait a minute!
637429 639472 You forgot to sign!
641808 643018 Who's that?
643685 646396 Wait a minute.<br />You forgot to sign the form.
646896 647981 Who're you?
648064 649607 You're not the regular guy.
649691 652152 - He's on vacation.<br />- On vacation?!
652402 654320 Well, who the hell is that?
654988 656531 Get in the truck!
664581 666124 You fucking prick!
674299 675759 Are you a cop?
676009 679346 Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.<br />Will continue transmission.
679387 680513 Call 911.
680597 683641 - Okay, honey.<br />- Let me drive. We're in pursuit.
683975 685977 I'm driving! Don't worry.
693193 696488 This fool picked the wrong time<br />to mess with the wrong lady.
696571 698114 Just stay close!
704913 706664 Right behind you, baby!
707165 708583 Take a good look!
708667 711795 Delores the Road Warrior<br />is dead on your raggedy ass!
720970 722305 Ram him!
729229 731106 - Watch out, Riggs!<br />- Come on!
740407 741574 Are you married, sugar?
741658 744160 What? Yes, 24 years! 24 years!
744452 746204 Yeah, but is it working?
751710 754671 - You can't get closer?<br />- I am! I'm getting closer.
757424 758466 Hold on, Riggs!
758550 759551 Hold on!
769352 771396 Hold on! Hold on! We got you!
771479 772772 Hold on!
773898 776109 - I told you I could!<br />- Closer!
776192 778236 - Get me up there!<br />- Go!
778319 779529 I am! I am!
785076 786202 Back off!
799299 800592 If he falls, don't hit him!
800759 803345 Don't worry, I got something for you!
843593 846805 Thanks for the interest, sugar,<br />but one thing at a time!
861903 863405 Catch him!
866408 868618 Keep singing! Just stay close!
876376 877919 Relax, baby. Relax.
878253 880296 Keep your hands off my thigh!
880547 883049 - He's in trouble. Watch out!<br />- I got him!
896730 898481 I'm getting too old for this.
898565 900608 Not for me, you're not, sugar.
904237 906823 You have the right to remain unconscious.
907365 909951 Anything you say, it ain't gonna be much.
914497 916207 Hey, Riggs. You all right?
916291 920295 I'm okay. I just have to book this guy<br />for not wearing his seat belt.
920754 922839 That was dynamite driving.
922922 926301 - She's a dynamite driver!<br />- I'll show you dynamite!
927344 928970 Sho 'nuff!
930305 932390 What have you two been up to?
932640 934184 What do you mean? We were in pursuit!
934225 936895 - I saw you kiss her.<br />- She kissed me!
936978 940231 It looked mutual to me.<br />Wipe that lipstick off.
940315 942484 Hey, go spit, Riggs!
944402 945487 You okay?
945779 947072 You all right?
947781 949616 Back to bed. Back to bed.
950033 952494 Good morning, guys. Daddy.
952702 955789 How about treating your dad<br />to breakfast today?
956873 960001 - You've got six more days to go.<br />- Laundry service.
961795 963380 Hold this. Hangers?
963463 967008 I'm springing for the soap.<br />Nothing too fancy. Cute dog.
967175 968593 It's a Westie.
969094 970512 'Morning, Trish.
971096 972389 'Morning, Rog.
973515 974933 - 'Morning, Nick.<br />- Spare me.
975016 978061 - Not until you brush your teeth.<br />- Hold it, mister.
978144 980063 Just looking for some orange juice.
980146 983817 No fingerprints on the door<br />and put the glass in the dishwasher.
983900 985610 Did somebody commit a murder?
985694 987904 Someone's coming to see the house.
988071 990573 I think a little mess adds to the charm.
1001167 1002752 How's this?
1003253 1005547 It's great? Okay? Okay?
1006589 1008091 Kelly's Pool Hall.
1008133 1011094 Right, Kelly, hi. Let me speak to Dad.
1011386 1015181 Hi, honey. How are you?<br />I thought I asked you not to call me here.
1015640 1017684 - It's for you.<br />- Me?
1020437 1022272 Who is it? Hello?
1022355 1026317 Hi. It's my first day at work.<br />You going to come by and wish me luck?
1026401 1029821 - Beautiful, huh? Come on, check it out.<br />- Beautiful lawn.
1029904 1031114 It's great.
1031364 1033700 See how quiet it is here? Listen.
1033950 1035493 Isn't that great? Come on.
1035577 1037829 - It's quiet.<br />- The inside's even better.
1037871 1041207 - It's the people, to look at the house.<br />- And our broker.
1044794 1046338 Just want to be sure.
1046671 1049466 I'll show you this room first.<br />It's my favorite.
1051468 1054012 - Isn't it? Does that say it all?<br />- Very nice.
1054054 1056139 I love that picture window.
1057807 1060477 - It's just been completely replaced.<br />- Why?
1060518 1063605 A drug dealer came through with his car<br />and crashed right in.
1063688 1065523 Shot up the whole place.
1065774 1069027 Son of a bitch.<br />I'm going to cut him off at the knees!
1070403 1074074 It's true. It's true. True.<br />Okay, okay, anyway, look.
1074157 1076618 Like the drapes?<br />Maybe she'll leave them.
1076868 1078703 - I thought you quit.<br />- I did.
1078995 1082165 - You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.<br />- I'm itchy.
1083041 1084250 Here.
1085126 1086503 Chew on these.
1086878 1091007 I have to tell you this. It's the law.<br />It's called full disclosure.
1091174 1094177 Anything else you want to disclose<br />before we go on?
1095053 1098723 Okay, since you mention it, the bathroom<br />has been completely remodeled...
1098807 1100266 ...due to unexpected bomb damage.
1100809 1102435 Hey, come on. It's okay.
1102519 1104104 Son of a bitch.
1104187 1106940 Don't, don't. You'll never sell the house.
1112153 1114781 Okay, okay.<br />We saw enough of the kitchen.
1114864 1119285 I'll show you upstairs. Wait till you see it.<br />It's beautiful. You'll love it.
1124457 1127377 They're gone. Leo Getz,<br />someday I'll kill him!
1127460 1130005 Son of a bitch! I'm going to kill him!
1130088 1132173 You have to let me, Riggs!
1134426 1136302 They weren't going to buy it anyway!
1136386 1139764 - You scared them away!<br />- They couldn't afford to buy it!
1139806 1142267 - Oh, I see.<br />- Okay, relax.
1142559 1146187 I had to tell them everything.<br />It's the law. Full disclosure.
1146271 1148982 - You heard of it?<br />- I'm a cop! I am the law!
1149774 1152819 - Get off me! What is it with you?<br />- Hold it!
1155196 1158533 At least he didn't tell them<br />about the nail gun incident.
1159826 1163079 I forgot. Did you have a permit<br />when you built over the garage?
1163121 1164372 Permit?
1164456 1167125 Hold it! Leo's here. I'll take care of it.
1167208 1170295 I'll make some calls.<br />We'll get some back-dated permits.
1170545 1173131 - Which phone can I use?<br />- Sunroom.
1175925 1178845 - It must be easier than this.<br />- Count on Leo Getz.
1178887 1182265 You need less aggravation.<br />Come to work with me.
1182640 1184934 Thank you, Leo! Son of a bitch!
1185143 1189939 Stop fronting yourself. You know?<br />Swing with me and my crew.
1194819 1196696 - I got school.<br />- Ditch school.
1199491 1201659 Here comes your pops.
1202577 1204371 - Later, all right.<br />- Gotcha.
1205747 1207415 Next time.
1210835 1213046 - 'Morning, Rog.<br />- How you doing?
1215173 1216508 Hey, Nick.
1217550 1219386 - Wasn't that Darryl?<br />- Yeah.
1219844 1222097 Haven't seen him around in a while.
1222889 1224140 He dropped out.
1224224 1226434 Pretty gang colors, he's wearing.
1226726 1228144 Yeah, I know.
1229604 1230855 Hey, Nick.
1231898 1232982 Yeah, Dad.
1233191 1234442 Be good.
1235151 1236111 Word.
1238988 1240240 Word, Nick.
1240782 1242033 Word.
1245370 1246579 Word, Riggs.
1246621 1248039 Word, Rog.
1249207 1250750 - What are we talking about?<br />- Word.
1250834 1253503 Four letters. Starts with a "W,"<br />"O" in the middle, "D" in the end.
1253586 1255505 Oh, yeah, that word.
1256715 1257757 Word.
1271938 1275108 - Tyrone, my man, how are you?<br />- Jack, how's it going?
1275233 1277569 - Let's take a walk.<br />- Wait here for me.
1277652 1280572 Look around. This is my dream<br />and it's all coming true.
1280613 1285118 You sank your money into this,<br />out here in the middle of the desert?
1285660 1288163 - Know why it'll be a gold mine?<br />- Do tell.
1288329 1292334 Because no one wants to live<br />next door to a menace like you.
1292375 1295712 I came to do business,<br />not be insulted by you.
1295920 1297714 Relax, Tyrone.
1297797 1300133 Like houses, friendships need<br />strong foundations.
1300216 1302969 Smitty, come here. Come here.
1305889 1309309 What's wrong with you?<br />Don't I pay you good, take care of you?
1309392 1312645 - Sure you do.<br />- Then why the stunt you and Billy pulled?
1313396 1314606 It was a good plan. It worked.
1314689 1316983 It worked?! It didn't work.
1317108 1318943 You got nailed first time out.
1318985 1321529 Nobody working for me<br />goes into business for themselves.
1321613 1323073 Do you understand me?
1323156 1325700 See how that can jeopardize everything?<br />Right?
1325742 1327077 Whatever.
1327619 1330121 Especially trying to pop an armored car.
1330538 1334209 Okay, Billy got caught.<br />There's nothing I can do about that now.
1334459 1337212 He'll have to face the music on his own.
1337379 1339089 But you and me...
1339381 1340882 ...we're gonna start over.
1340965 1342550 You know what I mean?
1343760 1345762 - Whatever you say.<br />- Good.
1345887 1348515 Glad you understand<br />what I'm talking about.
1354979 1357565 Now we got a relationship<br />we can build on.
1359776 1363071 - Employee problems. You know how it is.<br />- Yeah, right.
1363446 1366157 You invest time and energy<br />into training somebody.
1366241 1369953 They get greedy and do something stupid<br />that jeopardizes everything.
1370036 1371454 It's a bitch!
1371663 1374040 Stick around. This is the good part.
1374165 1376918 - We can put our initials in there.<br />- Yeah?
1377752 1379212 Jesus Christ!
1383008 1385719 Lankershim and Vineland.<br />Where are we going?
1385885 1389639 Right here. Rianne's got a new job.<br />I promised I'd stop by.
1389931 1391683 That's a good reason.
1392517 1395270 All right. Here we are.
1401693 1404529 - You got any silver, any change?<br />- We're cops.
1405238 1408825 That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.<br />I'll get change.
1419002 1421338 Get down! All of you!
1444277 1445403 How do you like that?
1445487 1448031 What are you doing with a rubber gun?
1448198 1449532 This is a film!
1449657 1453036 Cut, cut, cut! Who the fuck is this lunatic?
1453119 1455246 - Get him off my set.<br />- It's not part of the story.
1455330 1457374 Can we get a cop?
1459709 1463129 Rianne, I'm so sorry.<br />I feel like a microbe right now.
1463338 1466257 - You really thought I was in trouble?<br />- Oh, I did.
1466466 1469386 A real cop! Go sit in your fucking trailer!
1469427 1471805 - Are you a fucking idiot?!<br />- I apologize.
1472389 1475517 He's a friend of mine, a policeman.<br />Thought I was in trouble.
1475558 1476559 We're both...
1476601 1478103 He's a friend of yours?
1478186 1481731 Let me tell you something: You're fired.<br />Have a nice day.
1482023 1484234 Fired? Riggs, what'd you do?
1484818 1486236 You're not fired.
1486319 1488822 No, you're not. Just take it easy.
1488905 1491241 You can't fire her for something I did.
1491324 1493702 I don't care whose mistake it was!<br />She's fired!
1493785 1495328 I apologize to everyone.
1495412 1496663 Don't push him!
1496746 1498081 All of you, go!
1498206 1500250 Just take it easy. Don't push him.
1500291 1503169 Get off my set, all right?<br />What are you, deaf?
1503878 1505296 Get off my set!
1505380 1507549 On any normal day,<br />I'd smack you in the mouth.
1507632 1508717 Is that so?
1508800 1509676 Don't!
1509759 1511636 It's a normal day.
1511845 1514848 I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay?<br />I'm sorry.
1514931 1518226 I'm all thumbs! He fell down!<br />Let me help you.
1518518 1520353 I said, don't hit him!
1520437 1522188 - Is she fired?<br />- Yes, she's fired!
1522272 1524107 - Is she fired?<br />- No, no.
1524190 1525525 - It's okay.<br />- Does she have a raise?
1525608 1527318 - Yes! I said yes!<br />- Good.
1528361 1531031 Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.
1532407 1534451 We'd like you to come back.
1539372 1541583 You can't settle every problem<br />with your fists.
1541666 1545086 - I couldn't use my gun with that crowd.<br />- Six more days.
1545170 1547047 Look, I don't want to hear that.
1547088 1549966 Did Rianne get her job back?<br />Did she get a raise?
1550175 1552052 I don't hear a thank you.
1552385 1555972 Maybe I should become<br />a Hollywood agent. What do you think?
1556890 1558767 - It won't work.<br />- Why?
1558892 1561144 You don't have that killer instinct.
1561227 1562854 Son of a bitch!
1563480 1567859 - We should've put a bag on the meter.<br />- Put it in the glove compartment.
1567984 1569444 I don't do that anymore.
1569486 1571196 Oh, yeah? Good man.
1571321 1573656 It's full. Put it in the back seat.
1577744 1581122 - How can you like those things?<br />- These? They're good.
1583792 1587003 You eat a box up<br />and still die for a cigarette.
1590882 1593343 - Cut yourself shaving?<br />- Yeah.
1594177 1595553 Old razor?
1596221 1597472 Old face.
1599683 1602852 You're letting this retirement thing<br />get you down.
1603770 1606898 Spend a few more years<br />to get used to the idea. Why quit?
1606981 1610026 - I got plans for my retirement.<br />- Oh, yeah, plans.
1610110 1611736 - I do. Big plans.<br />- Big plans?
1611820 1613947 - I had them for a long time.<br />- Like what?
1614030 1615573 Like...
1617283 1619577 - Things, man!<br />- Things!
1619911 1620954 Things!
1621037 1622664 Things I've put off.
1622747 1625542 Oh, those things. I got those, too.
1626167 1628712 I see you've given this a lot of thought.
1633717 1635844 I've given it a lot of thought.
1655947 1657323 Goddamn it!
1657782 1661161 - What's going on?<br />- I'm pissed off. You need a reason?
1661202 1665331 - I thought I heard gunfire.<br />- Get your ears checked! Put that away!
1665498 1666875 What're you looking at?
1666958 1668626 Hey, man. Peace.
1691858 1694110 Why'd you call us down here?
1696654 1698114 How you doing, son?
1698156 1700617 Your mother know you're here?
1704204 1706414 - Did you do this?<br />- Nice shooting.
1706581 1708625 Better than Billy the Kid.
1708958 1711002 Diaper rash makes you cranky.
1711127 1714589 Give it to your mom.<br />Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.
1714673 1716925 - Can I borrow your glasses?<br />- Yeah.
1717133 1718426 Who's wearing?
1718718 1720178 Roger, you are.
1720261 1722305 Why me?<br />You guys should be wearing.
1722389 1724599 Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.
1724724 1727185 I don't need help.<br />I've been dressing myself since I was 30.
1727268 1729771 - Okay, man, just trying to help.<br />- Get back.
1729813 1731564 All you perverts, turn your heads.
1731648 1734025 - Take it off, baby!<br />- Hold this shirt.
1735694 1737112 Wearing a girdle!
1737779 1740156 - He's got a girdle!<br />- This is not a girdle.
1740240 1742242 This is not a girdle. It's my back!
1742325 1744119 My back went out on me.
1745370 1749165 I hurt it lifting weights.<br />What're you talking about?
1749708 1751209 I saw him do it.
1751292 1752419 Everybody, listen up.
1752502 1755755 I want you all to look at<br />these lovely bullets.
1756006 1756798 Cute.
1756840 1760552 Notice the smooth jacket.<br />Pay particular attention to the tip.
1765473 1769394 Now you've all seen these vests<br />stop a.357 magnum bullet.
1773773 1775275 Observe.
1790749 1792083 Son of a bitch!
1794419 1797297 - Armor-piercing bullets?<br />- Yeah, cop killers.
1798757 1802552 Those bullets came from the gun<br />of a suspect we arrested yesterday.
1802635 1804929 They're out there on the streets.
1805096 1808433 Vests are optional, boys and girls.<br />Especially boys.
1808808 1810185 See you, Riggs.
1812937 1814314 Cop killers.
1816608 1818151 Son of a bitch.
1821071 1825784 I think we should talk to Billy Phelps.<br />I'll have him brought in for interrogation.
1834709 1837379 I'm here to talk to Billy Phelps.
1837504 1839923 Can I see your ID, please?
1840590 1844260 William Phelps, armored car suspect.<br />He's been moved to interrogation.
1844344 1847097 - Know where that is?<br />- Sure. Been there a lot.
1857357 1859025 Same floor.
1860944 1866157 I guess now you're retiring, that Swiss<br />bank account will come in pretty handy.
1866533 1869411 How much you got in there, a million?<br />Million and a half?
1869494 1870745 - Five.<br />- Five.
1871788 1873707 Well, you deserve it.
1873873 1877002 Better than those miserable<br />drug dealers getting it.
1881256 1883133 What're you talking about?
1883466 1887387 Don't sweat it. You laundered it,<br />didn't you? They can't trace it.
1887762 1889639 - They can't trace it.<br />- What?
1889806 1893184 So long as I get an invite<br />to Casa de Murtaugh, I'm happy.
1893393 1894644 Casa what?!
1894811 1896938 - I've never been to Portugal.<br />- Stop joking.
1896980 1898231 She's a cop!
1898314 1901609 I know she's a cop.<br />And she's probably on the take, too.
1902861 1904612 The whole force is bent.
1904988 1907615 She may be wearing a skirt,<br />but we're all brothers.
1907699 1910952 And I have nothing.<br />I ain't been to Portugal.
1911703 1913830 Listen to me.
1916958 1918960 Son of a bitch.
1919711 1921755 - How you doing?<br />- Fine.
1921880 1924007 - Who is it today?<br />- Billy Phelps.
1925633 1926760 Who're you?
1926843 1929721 Fly me.<br />I'm your friendly Portuguese Airline.
1930472 1932015 She's Infernal Affairs.
1932057 1933099 How'd you know?
1933183 1936186 I took the liberty<br />of looking at your file folder.
1937187 1938438 Lorna Cole.
1939397 1942359 - And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- I used to be.
1942525 1945570 What's Infernal Repairs<br />want with our collar?
1945862 1947655 We're taking over, thanks.
1947781 1949657 Nobody told us they were taking over.
1949741 1951785 Nobody has to tell you anything,<br />Patrolman.
1951868 1953370 I want to go and see the captain.
1953453 1956373 You want to see the captain?<br />Let's go see the captain.
1956456 1959751 - And put on a vest.<br />- Oh, are you wearing one?
1959876 1962003 Just take it easy, man.
1974891 1978269 Hey, guys. Phelps, William.<br />Actually, his name's Billy.
1978520 1979813 You, too?
1980021 1982190 - Popular guy today.<br />- Somebody with him?
1982273 1985402 No, not really.<br />He's down the hall to the right.
1985568 1987237 Want to sign in here?
1988321 1989489 Miss.
1990407 1994327 - What's Internal Affairs doing here?<br />- Don't start. I just found out myself.
1994411 1996621 Herman Walters, chief of intelligence.
1996705 1998915 You haven't met his daughter,<br />Lorna Doone.
1998957 2000583 Pleased to meet you.
2000750 2003670 The Phelps case is transferred<br />to Internal Affairs.
2003753 2004671 Why?
2004754 2006881 - I can't tell you.<br />- That's classified.
2006965 2009718 We busted our buns busting this guy.<br />We busted him.
2009801 2012137 Busted is right.<br />He spent the night in hospital.
2012178 2014431 - He didn't buckle up.<br />- We even cited him.
2014514 2016474 I know, I read your report.
2017100 2019769 Our cases have, unfortunately,<br />crossed paths here.
2019853 2022439 That's all I can say.<br />We'll take over from here.
2022480 2024941 Captain, what is she talking about here?
2024983 2027861 - That's classified.<br />- No, I'm talking to him.
2027902 2029487 I'm telling you...
2029529 2032115 No, I said, "Captain."<br />I'm talking to the captain.
2032198 2035368 - That's classified!<br />- I'm talking to him!
2035452 2036911 That's bullshit!
2039330 2042125 Maybe these guys can contribute<br />something to this case.
2042167 2045712 From their records,<br />they only contribute mayhem and chaos.
2045879 2048298 I'm Chaos, he's Mayhem.<br />We're a double act.
2048381 2050383 What are we,<br />required reading or something?
2050467 2052010 As a matter of fact, you are.
2052052 2055347 It's a cross between "Police Gazette"<br />and "Mad" magazine.
2055388 2058099 - What's wrong with "Mad"?<br />- Nothing, I used to read it.
2058600 2060268 You've got some taste.
2060352 2061644 When I was 12.
2062979 2064647 Riggs, let's go.
2064731 2066858 We busted him, we could talk to him.
2066941 2069194 - Captain.<br />- Riggs. Murtaugh.
2069444 2071571 Get your asses back here.
2074908 2076743 You'll be needing these.
2077535 2079579 I'm reinstating both of you.
2080163 2082290 - Don't you just love him?<br />- Yeah.
2082916 2084042 God!
2086211 2087879 You really are a beautiful man.
2087962 2089714 Just get rid of the blues.
2089798 2092717 - They don't go with your ponytail.<br />- Absolutely not.
2094511 2095762 Yeah, right.
2095887 2097055 Get a haircut.
2097138 2098640 Of course, I won't.
2098848 2100684 You exceeded your authority, Captain.
2100725 2103353 - That's not how I see it.<br />- The chief will.
2103436 2105689 - Take it up with him.<br />- I think I will.
2105772 2109693 Catch up with them. We don't want<br />this screwed up with cowboy tactics.
2109776 2111111 Son of a bitch.
2113613 2114739 Hi, Billy.
2117951 2118993 Jack!
2119077 2120203 Bye, Billy.
2128211 2129879 See you, Billy.
2136928 2139014 Sergeant, did you get what you need?
2139097 2141599 Not really.<br />It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.
2143518 2145729 How long has Phelps been doing this?
2145812 2148732 - Doing what?<br />- This armored car thing.
2148940 2151985 I wouldn't know.<br />I'm not interested in armored cars.
2166041 2168501 I don't think she's telling us everything.
2168585 2169961 I think you're right.
2170045 2172797 Boy, these six days is going to be rough.
2172881 2174758 God, be good to me.
2177218 2181014 Shit, son of a bitch knew there was<br />a camera in the wall.
2181890 2182557 Dammit!
2182640 2185435 He didn't know there was one<br />in the interrogation room.
2185518 2187020 There isn't.
2188063 2189522 We installed them six months ago.
2189606 2191441 - Every station.<br />- That's great.
2191524 2194319 Six months and we don't know about it?
2194402 2196112 This is the police police, Captain.
2196196 2199866 Police police. Very good. Can you say<br />that three times in a row, real fast?
2199949 2202452 - Why? Am I getting to you?<br />- You trying to bait me?
2202535 2204037 I'm a master of it.
2204120 2205121 That figures.
2205538 2208249 Baiting master. Try all the tricks.
2208416 2210168 Freeze that. Stop it.
2210335 2211836 Jack Travis.
2212045 2213004 Who?
2213129 2216174 Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
2216633 2218093 He was one of us.
2218259 2221137 Hell of a brutal cop.<br />Could beat a confession out of anyone.
2221221 2222597 A dirty cop.
2222722 2226726 I've never seen so many suspensions and<br />reprimands and charges of misconduct.
2226810 2229229 He's also as tough as they come.
2229771 2231189 What happened to him?
2231231 2232440 I don't know.
2232524 2236444 His partner and him were on a stakeout.<br />He went for coffee, never came back.
2236528 2239197 Looks like he had<br />one cappuccino too many.
2239406 2241157 We better brief Walters.
2241700 2243910 Excuse me, cute stuff.
2244077 2246788 - That's harassment.<br />- Cute stuff. That's you.
2247622 2251292 - Captain.<br />- Boys, boys. Just the captain.
2251418 2255046 Your involvement in this case ended<br />when Phelps hit the floor.
2255213 2258091 Why don't you just go back<br />and beat your street?
2258675 2261761 - Now's the time to buy.<br />- Not now.
2261928 2264097 - Hey, Roger, Roger!<br />- Not now, Leo!
2264180 2267017 - Not now!<br />- We got to talk, babe, okay?
2267100 2269060 You're in trouble. You got termites.
2269144 2270437 Termites?
2270812 2273648 - Oh, God!<br />- You're infested!
2273815 2275650 The only thing holding up your house<br />is the paint.
2275692 2276901 We should go.
2276985 2279362 Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
2279446 2281948 We should pull every file on this guy.
2281990 2284534 I know this guy. Is that Geraldo?
2284617 2285910 - What?<br />- I know the guy.
2285994 2288830 - How do you know him?<br />- I've seen the guy before.
2288913 2291416 - Where?<br />- I don't know. I recognize him...
2291416 2294252 His name is Jack Travis.<br />Does that ring a bell?
2295211 2297213 Hands off the clothes. Okay?
2297672 2299674 I'm thinking. Let me think.
2300467 2302093 It was a big party.
2302177 2305597 Someone brought a monkey<br />that knocked over the salad bar.
2305764 2309142 And this guy comes in,<br />introduced me to another guy...
2309351 2311227 ...who wants a favor.
2311770 2313605 - I got it! I got it!<br />- What?
2313646 2314439 He's got it!
2315065 2316941 - I remember!<br />- You remember!
2317359 2320153 Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.
2320737 2323073 - We're back. We're back!<br />- Yeah. Yeah.
2323239 2324366 Listen, listen.
2324449 2326326 Can I have a gun this time?
2337337 2342467 Okay, this is it! These guys always<br />wanted me to do favors for them!
2342634 2346554 Like, some guys wanted broads,<br />another guy, Cuban cigars.
2346721 2348473 Your guy, hockey!
2348682 2350642 The best seats in the house!
2353395 2355397 - Where's the seats?<br />- Yeah.
2356564 2359192 Probably by the glass.
2359484 2362028 Does "needle in a haystack"<br />mean anything to you?
2362112 2363697 Why don't we spread out?
2363780 2367826 If we all take a different direction,<br />it'd be like old times.
2368660 2371746 Don't push, lady!<br />I'm on police business here!
2371788 2373665 Just take it easy!
2402819 2405280 Los Angeles penalty. Number 15.
2406364 2408408 Two minutes for high-sticking.
2408491 2410660 Time, 5:15.
2430263 2432640 Mr. Jack Travis?
2433391 2436770 Mr. Jack Travis, this is the LAPD.
2437979 2441524 We know you're in here. We know<br />where you are. Just stay in your seat.
2441608 2443193 Don't be stupid.
2443777 2446279 I'll be there to escort you out<br />in a minute.
2446363 2449783 There's a policeman at every exit,<br />so it's no use trying to run.
2449866 2451868 Smart son of a bitch.
2452035 2454746 Thanks for your cooperation.<br />Play on, boys.
2482357 2484317 Get out of my fucking way!
2497122 2498373 Excuse me.
2511720 2513304 You can't be on the ice!
2520687 2522355 I got him! I got him!
2524899 2527986 You have the right...<br />You're under arrest!
2537120 2538329 Fucking weasel!
2538371 2540415 What the hell's going on here?!
2540457 2542083 I'm LAPD! LAPD!
2542334 2544836 I don't care! You can't be on the ice!
2551468 2552594 I got him!
2552886 2555096 You're all right, pal. Stay calm.
2558058 2559559 Make sure you tell my mother!
2559601 2560977 Where'd he go?
2561061 2562354 Down there!
2573198 2575241 Son of a bitch!
2578286 2580914 He thinks I don't know I'm dying.<br />I know it.
2581790 2584292 - You'll be okay.<br />- I'm dying, Roger.
2585335 2586961 I'm choking, see?
2587295 2589506 That's what they do when they die.
2589547 2591591 Leo, it's going to be okay.
2593218 2595512 My body's numb! I can't feel it!
2595845 2598515 I'm going to die, I know it! What?
2598973 2600809 You're lying on the ice.
2602769 2605480 - That's why I'm cold?<br />- That's why you're cold.
2605563 2608108 - That's why I'm numb?<br />- That's why you're numb.
2608191 2610068 But he shot me. See all the blood.
2610110 2612904 - It's just a flesh wound.<br />- So it's okay.
2618451 2622205 He's okay, he's okay!<br />He's going to make it! He's alive!
2627836 2630964 - Bring him this way.<br />- I can't believe this.
2632757 2635010 - I can't believe I got shot.<br />- Calm down.
2635093 2636386 Riggs, you here?
2636469 2639305 We're all the same now. We all got shot.
2639472 2640932 You'll be fine.
2641516 2642475 Relax.
2642684 2645645 I'm fine. Nothing wrong with me.<br />I can take this.
2646312 2647939 Just calm down.<br />We'll take care of it.
2648023 2650275 You'll be out of here tonight.<br />It's not a big deal.
2650358 2652986 This isn't a good idea.<br />You shouldn't rush this, Doc.
2653069 2654571 You should rest up.
2654612 2656614 A dumdum wound can be serious.
2656865 2658533 What's a dumdum wound?
2658992 2663079 You don't know? A guy got his thumb<br />shot off by a dumdum.
2663288 2665665 From the shock,<br />he was dead two days later.
2665749 2667334 Dead two days later?
2667417 2669002 He died from dumdums?
2669127 2671671 - We'll keep you overnight.<br />- Make it two.
2671838 2672881 Two days?
2673006 2674966 Okay, we'll keep him two days.
2675091 2676801 That Leo's chart?
2676968 2680388 - Two days, you'll be good as new.<br />- I should be with them.
2680472 2681890 I should be with...
2683224 2684976 How do you spell, "proctological"?
2685018 2686686 Rectal exam!
2687145 2690231 - No, you can't do that to Leo.<br />- Sure, we can.
2690273 2691191 Why's she...
2691274 2692734 Please, Mr. Getz.
2693526 2696696 You've been shot in the arm?<br />Let her take it. You'll get it back.
2696780 2698865 There's a clock in your room.
2700784 2702994 Does this look like a dumdum wound?
2703036 2705705 - It sounded like one when it happened.<br />- Shit.
2705789 2709668 - Take it easy. Two days.<br />- Two days and you'll be out. No problem.
2710085 2713421 - I'll see you guys.<br />- We won't make a move without you.
2713588 2715256 I thought it sounded different.
2715340 2718468 - Relax. They'll be there when you get out.<br />- I'm fine.
2718551 2720637 - You own your house, Doc?<br />- What?
2720720 2722764 - You don't recognize my face?<br />- No, sir.
2722806 2724015 Watch.
2724891 2728603 About time. The doggy treats are okay,<br />but I need some human food.
2728687 2732482 Don't worry. I'll make you<br />the best thing you ever had.
2735568 2739197 - You ever eat one of my hamburgers?<br />- I've been lucky so far.
2740198 2741658 Fast Eddie!
2742117 2744077 - How's business?<br />- Booming. Can't you tell?
2744160 2746746 Yeah, I'm looking at it.<br />You meet my partner?
2746830 2749791 I want to cook one<br />of those monster burgers for him.
2749833 2751334 - Go for it.<br />- All right.
2751418 2753586 - You'll let him cook?<br />- Do I have a choice?
2753670 2756089 No, because it's Wednesday.
2756214 2757632 Why argue?
2757966 2760051 In that case, give me a MacRog.
2760176 2761594 Hold the hair.
2762387 2763638 You wash your hands?
2763680 2767225 Keep joking. But I guarantee<br />you're gonna like this burger.
2767642 2771563 And you're gonna come back<br />with your friends.
2771855 2775191 I haven't got any friends,<br />you know that, except for you.
2775692 2778194 He's a comedian in his spare time.
2778653 2780947 When is he gonna say something funny?
2781031 2782741 You gonna put that out?
2782907 2784492 You're finished with it, yeah?
2784576 2786369 Do you mind? Thanks.
2788580 2790957 Sorry. I was just looking at it.
2791041 2792792 Chew on this onion.
2794044 2796046 He's quitting, so help him.
2796921 2798715 I was only looking at it.
2801801 2803511 First thing is the fat.
2803720 2805847 Everyone says, "Cut the fat."
2806473 2809809 My uncle said, "You cut the fat,<br />you kill the burger." Right?
2809893 2810643 Yeah.
2810685 2814230 There's an art to it.<br />You just can't plop them on the grill.
2816775 2819152 Gently coax the flavors out.
2821613 2823615 Yo, hey, what's the problem?
2830705 2834167 A little pepper,<br />then you massage it a little bit.
2834584 2835919 Just a little bit.
2836002 2838588 Sweet, sweet meat.
2841341 2843259 Shit, man, feel it.
2847097 2848306 Okay, guys!
2848640 2850600 LAPD. Let me see your hands.
2850684 2853144 Let me see your hands!<br />Get them up!
2853228 2857107 In the car! Get them up there!<br />Let me see both of them! Come on!
2861653 2862821 Hey, Riggs!
2871496 2872455 Riggs!
2873915 2876418 Don't you love me? For five days!
2884759 2886344 Don't do that to me!
2886428 2888430 - Riggs, you okay?<br />- Yeah.
2888513 2889889 Who did it?
2892434 2893935 All right, asshole!
2893977 2896312 I want to see your hands right now.
2923757 2925216 Back me up, Riggs!
2951993 2953370 Darryl?!
2959751 2961211 Fuck, no!
2961544 2962671 Fuck, no!
2966132 2969552 Call an ambulance!<br />Call an ambulance! Breathe!
2970095 2971638 Please, breathe!
2972180 2973473 Breathe!
2973682 2975475 Call an ambulance!
2976685 2978937 Come on! Breathe! Oh, God!
2979187 2980814 Fuck, it's Darryl!
2983316 2985068 Oh, God, don't do this to me! Breathe!
2985151 2987654 - He's dead.<br />- Breathe! Breathe!
2987946 2990240 - God, don't do this!<br />- He's dead.
2990699 2992784 He's dead! Rog, he's dead!
2993243 2995870 He's dead, Rog!<br />Don't mess with the corpse.
2996287 2999457 He's dead. Come on, man,<br />it was a clean shoot.
2999749 3001835 It's okay, it was a clean shoot.
3002002 3004379 He was gonna do you<br />and he was gonna do me.
3004462 3006089 It's okay. You okay?
3006923 3008466 It's not okay.
3009843 3011386 I know that kid.
3014264 3015640 I know that kid.
3017100 3018893 He's Nick's friend.
3037245 3039122 - Got it, Mom.<br />- I'll get it.
3039914 3041041 Hello?
3041416 3042792 Hi, Martin.
3043501 3044878 He's not here.
3052802 3054637 Oh, my God!
3057766 3059142 Thanks.
3090215 3091341 Fuck!
3097597 3099891 How you doing? Taking your vitamins?
3099974 3102977 - Riggs, how's Murtaugh?<br />- He's good. He's fine.
3103770 3106898 - I'm sure he's anything but fine.<br />- Really, he's okay.
3107023 3110610 - I'd really like to talk to him.<br />- That's not such a good idea.
3111319 3113196 The best is to leave him alone.
3113238 3117158 - Let's get something for your cold.<br />- I know what I'm talking about.
3118410 3121538 - We have to talk.<br />- Talking to you is bad for my image.
3121663 3123873 - I'm afraid I insist.<br />- Oh, you insist?
3123957 3128044 In that case, let's find some privacy.<br />Step into my "ore-ffice".
3134384 3137429 - Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?<br />- Hey, Riggs.
3137554 3141516 - Clip any wrong wires lately?<br />- I haven't done that for a couple days.
3142058 3144310 Next time, wait for the bomb squad.
3144394 3145645 Yeah, it's our job.
3145729 3148398 I'll remember. We saved a cat, though.
3148481 3150316 Great. I love cats.
3152527 3154237 Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.
3154320 3158783 You purposefully withheld information<br />concerning a case under my investigation.
3158908 3160326 Damn right, I did.
3160493 3162078 Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
3162162 3165165 You had a tip on Travis.<br />You should have shared it with me.
3165248 3166833 No, I take that back.
3167000 3169586 You were required to share it with me.
3170003 3172672 I was required to share it with you?
3172797 3174799 I don't have to share shit with you.
3174883 3178219 School yard rules: If you don't scratch<br />my back, I don't throw you...
3178303 3181973 - Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that!<br />- Yes, you can!
3182057 3184517 Why don't you cut out<br />this classified bullshit!
3184601 3187062 Right now! It's giving me the shits!
3187145 3190565 We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.<br />We're both on the same side, right?
3190607 3191858 - Right?<br />- Right!
3191941 3194819 Good! Why don't we start to act like it.
3195028 3199282 There's kids out there. Babies. No brains,<br />but they got automatic weapons.
3199366 3202994 - Yesterday, my partner nailed this kid...<br />- I know about Murtaugh.
3205455 3207582 Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riggs.
3208792 3209793 Yeah.
3215382 3218009 Why don't you let me in on this?<br />I can help you.
3218093 3221179 I really want to help you,<br />if you'll let me. Let me.
3221638 3223807 What do you say? We got a deal?
3227977 3229396 Wash your hands.
3232190 3234484 And meet me in my office.
3237237 3238780 I'll be right there.
3240573 3241991 Be right there.
3242867 3244911 MAC-10, 9 mm, semi-automatic...
3244994 3248289 ...converted to automatic<br />with 36 rounds in the magazine.
3248415 3250250 On a sesame seed bun.
3250500 3252043 Very illegal.
3252252 3254170 The gun has a history.<br />Wanna know about it?
3254254 3255380 Tell me.
3258591 3261928 Killed a convenience store clerk<br />in LA County, July 1990.
3262095 3266141 Used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990.
3266850 3271521 Confiscated by a truant officer<br />of the LA School Board, October 1990.
3272188 3274899 Scheduled for destruction by LAPD<br />six weeks ago.
3274983 3277027 Scheduled for destruction?
3277736 3279529 But it never got there.
3281990 3285160 Instead, it found its way<br />into the hands of a 15-year-old boy...
3285243 3287787 ...who fired it on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3287871 3289164 Thought it looked familiar.
3289247 3291332 That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3291416 3295295 ...were stolen from a police storage<br />facility before they could be destroyed.
3295378 3298214 They should be paper clips right now,<br />or license plates.
3298298 3302552 Anything but a gun. Here we are<br />busting our asses on the streets...
3302677 3306931 ...getting these weapons out of circulation<br />and now they're headed back out.
3307182 3312062 By busting Phelps, you stumbled onto<br />something the LAPD's tried to keep quiet.
3312312 3316024 That's why Internal Affairs is on this.<br />They think this is an inside job.
3316066 3318693 That's right.<br />They knew police procedures.
3319027 3321404 They knew where the guns were<br />and how to get in.
3321488 3324115 They even knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers.
3324199 3327077 They took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3327160 3329829 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />- Or an ex-cop.
3331164 3332374 Travis.
3335168 3337754 And you let him slip through your fingers.
3338630 3340632 That's closer than you ever got.
3340715 3342258 Close, Riggs?
3342425 3345470 Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window.
3348390 3350016 Want to go for a ride?
3350100 3351726 Sure, where we going?
3352352 3353770 Surprise.
3358900 3360777 Oh, I love surprises.
3361236 3362737 What is this place?
3362862 3365365 I accessed Billy Phelp's phone records<br />on my computer.
3365448 3367784 He made a dozen calls to this address.
3367867 3370161 Nice of you to steal that information.
3370203 3373748 - Semantics, Riggs.<br />- Semantics? Always up for some antics.
3375250 3377252 Let's go on three.
3377419 3378461 One.
3378545 3380880 - On three, or three and then go?<br />- What?
3380964 3383174 Never mind. One, two, three.
3385969 3387137 Got you.
3401651 3404195 Looks like Billy's grandmother<br />owns a big dog.
3404279 3406364 It's not a dog. It's a horse.
3406448 3408241 I hate dogs, Riggs.
3408992 3410285 I don't get it.
3410410 3413997 You don't get what?<br />It's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
3414289 3419169 I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window." I don't get it.
3419252 3420378 Later.
3425717 3427218 What're you doing?
3427469 3430430 I can't shoot a dog.<br />People, okay, but not dogs.
3430889 3433350 I should try to make friends with him.
3433516 3434893 Make friends?
3436061 3439773 Now don't run, because he'll only<br />chase you down and kill you.
3442317 3443401 Here, boy.
3443860 3444986 Here, boy.
3453953 3455246 Good boy!
3463838 3464964 Riggs.
3470387 3471888 You're crazy.
3492826 3494494 Want some? Do you?
3494619 3495704 Hungry?
3497539 3499249 You're a hungry boy.
3499416 3501835 Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
3504921 3507132 Here's more. Leave some for me.
3507424 3511177 Very slowly, as if you're not here,<br />just walk away.
3511636 3512762 You want me to go?
3512846 3514764 Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
3514848 3516516 Guy sort of thing?
3516599 3517976 Are you alone?
3527569 3528737 Stay, stay.
3530905 3532657 Come on, let's go.
3554763 3556181 How many is that?
3556264 3560310 - Fifty-five.<br />- Fifty-five. All right, we got eight more.
3560518 3562562 We'll get these later. Let's go.
3566608 3568026 Hi, fellas.
3568860 3570695 What's in all these boxes?
