112000 112960 Riggs, Homicide.
113200 114760 - Nobody's dead.<br />- The night's young.
115000 116360 This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
116600 118040 - Threat or a scare?<br />- Real thing.
118280 119400 He saw the device.
119640 122760 It's on Level 1, by the gas pumps.<br />I wrote the license plate number.
123000 124520 That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
124760 126760 - You evacuated the building?<br />- It's clean.
127000 128560 - Where's the bomb squad?<br />- Coming.
128800 130800 Good. It's under control. Let's go.
131040 133200 I think we ought to check this out.
133440 135080 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- What?
135320 137240 - Bomb squad's coming.<br />- There's no bomb.
137480 139760 - How do you know?<br />- Because it's a full moon.
140000 142040 Moon, lunar, lunatics. They're everywhere.
142280 144080 - Is that Greek?<br />- No, Latin.
144320 146000 You surprise the shit out of me.
146240 148280 There's no bomb.<br />It's probably a false alarm.
148520 150960 It happens. He probably saw a radio<br />on the back seat.
151200 153480 Let's not mess with it.<br />Wait for the bomb squad.
153720 156720 You're right. You sit tight,<br />I'll be right back.
156960 158320 What's the matter with you?
158560 160560 - There's a bomb in there!<br />- No, there's not.
160800 162640 - There's a bomb in there!<br />- There is not.
162880 164120 There's a bomb in there!
164360 165600 - You know how I know?<br />- How?
165840 169000 I've got eight days till retirement<br />and I won't make a stupid mistake.
169240 172000 There is no bomb.<br />I'll bet vital parts of my anatomy.
172240 173920 Look.
174160 176920 Trust me. Okay?
179800 183440 That's usually my first mistake.
183880 185720 Hey, wait. I'm coming.
185960 187000 Rog?
187240 189880 - Is your insurance paid up?<br />- Of course. Why?
190120 194240 - There could be a bomb in here.<br />- Oh, God!
195400 198720 - I hate it when I'm right.<br />- Learn to trust your instincts more.
198960 200320 Oh, God.
200560 204600 The first impression<br />can often be the right one.
206640 207400 Drive shaft...
207640 211080 - I wonder if there's a bomb.<br />- Just don't touch it.
211320 214160 Just looking.
217800 222880 What are you doing? Don't open the door!
225320 227160 Son of a bitch, just look at it.
227400 230720 That's all I'll do, just look.
232280 234600 There's more plastic than Cher.
234840 236720 I love this job. This is amateur night.
236960 238600 Open the door. I can't hear you.
238840 240120 Open the door.
240360 242680 Don't do nothing.
242920 244360 Not that one!
244600 245800 You son of a bitch.
246040 248800 This is a pretty shonky job.<br />I think I can dismantle it.
249040 252920 It looks like Beirut to me. Let's go!
254560 258200 Everybody's outside. Just me, you<br />and the cat are dumb enough to be here.
258440 261480 Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh?
261720 263320 - Relax, Rog. Relax.<br />- Right.
263560 264560 Don't do nothing.
264800 267800 We've got 9 minutes and 7 seconds left.<br />You know what we can do?
268040 269320 We could drive it out.
269560 271240 Fine, it's your turn to drive.
271480 273640 No keys. I could hot-wire it.
273880 276040 Don't even say "hot-wire"<br />around this stuff!
276280 277080 You're right.
277320 279200 Why am I doing this? Why?
279440 282120 We're going to have to do it<br />the old-fashioned way.
282360 283880 What are you thinking?
284120 286360 What are you thinking?
286600 288840 - I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.<br />- Wait!
289080 291480 - That's not what I think.<br />- You think maybe the red?
291720 292760 No! No!
293000 295040 I'm thinking it's 8 minutes and 42 seconds.
295280 298440 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, and have a cappuccino.
298680 302120 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />And it's 8 minutes, 31 seconds.
302360 303160 Rog, please.
303400 304640 Forget the cappuccino.
304880 307840 - You know what they'll say?<br />- "Get the fuck out of here!"
308080 312080 But then they'll say: "Let's cut<br />the blue wire", which I'll do right now.
312320 313760 - Wait, wait!<br />- What?
314000 315360 How can you be so sure?
315600 316600 It's just a hunch.
316840 317640 A hunch?
317880 319600 Remember the bomb under your toilet?
319840 322280 - How could I forget?<br />- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
322520 325240 This is more simplified,<br />but a bit more powerful.
325480 327160 From where I sat, I couldn't see.
327400 328920 Forget it. Come on, trust me.
329160 330040 Trust you?
330280 334240 Guess not. I'm cutting the red wire, okay?
335400 336360 What? What?
336600 339320 A minute ago you said blue.
339560 340280 I did?
340520 342000 You said blue.
342240 343800 - I meant red.<br />- Sure?
344040 345400 We can do it your way if you like.
345640 347640 - My way? I don't have...<br />- Quiet!
347880 348760 I'm sure, okay?
349000 351760 Ah, shit!
353080 354760 Ready?
355000 355520 Rog?
355760 356920 What?
357160 359880 Won't you miss all this good stuff<br />when you retire?
360120 363600 Won't you miss it a little bit?
364960 366760 I'm cutting the wire.
367000 370320 Snip. All done.
373640 374520 Grab the cat!
374760 375880 Grab the cat?
376120 379640 Get out of there! Take cover!
436600 439360 Where are they?
443000 445440 Bravo.
449080 451520 Whoops.
451880 455200 Right. "Whoops."
455960 459360 Right.
462680 465440 Seven days till retirement,<br />I'm busted down to patrolman.
465680 467800 I should've cut the red wire.
468040 470120 - You did.<br />- No, I cut the blue wire.
470360 471760 That's what I meant.
472000 475320 - We should've waited for the bomb squad.<br />- Must I hear this every day?
475560 479160 - Every day until I retire!<br />- That'll be a week too long.
479400 481760 - My feet are killing me.<br />- They're killing me, too.
482000 484360 - How?<br />- I have to listen to you bitch about them!
484600 488320 - Because you should've cut the red wire!<br />- I did cut the red wire!
488560 489320 What's this?
489560 491560 It's kind of soft. Not a bulletproof vest.
491800 493200 It won't keep anything out.
493440 494760 It'll keep my stomach in.
495000 497240 What have you got under there?
497480 498680 It's a girdle.
498920 500880 What?
501120 502760 It's a girdle.
503000 503880 Does Trish know?
504120 505400 It's a man's girdle.
505640 506920 They make girdles for men?
507160 509160 - Yes, they make girdles for men.<br />- They do?
509400 511880 Yeah, they do.<br />I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.
512120 514840 - Cleaners must have shrunk it.<br />- You should take it to Chin.
515080 518600 I did take it to Chin. Look at it.<br />It shrunk all up in here.
518840 520360 I have to hold my breath.
520600 521560 Did you see that?
521800 524240 - See what?<br />- Jaywalker.
524480 525840 Jaywalking?
526080 528280 Hold it right there, pal.<br />Step up here, please.
528520 529720 - Me?<br />- Yes, you.
529960 531240 - What'd I do?<br />- Stand there.
531480 534200 Jaywalking. I saw you.<br />I'll have to cite you.
534440 536800 Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on!
537040 540320 - Should I radio for backup?<br />- Smart-ass. Can you get the ticket book?
540560 543000 There are crimes in the city<br />and you're hassling me...
543240 546200 Shut up!
547720 551160 - Do you know how to fill one of these out?<br />- A long time ago.
551400 554920 I can't read it. The print is too small<br />without my glasses.
555160 558120 Can we speed this up?<br />You may have nothing to do, but I do.
558360 561320 No, we can't, so will you shut up?
561560 563400 - Jaywalking.<br />- Ask for his license.
563640 565240 - License, for jaywalking?<br />- Yeah.
565480 568120 I don't have it on me. I wasn't driving.
568360 570840 I was walking.<br />Do I need a walking license now?
571080 572760 - Let's just shoot him!<br />- Is he crazy?
573000 575680 I'm going to drill him!<br />We'll make it look like suicide!
575920 578280 - Get out of the way!<br />- No, the video cameras!
578520 580000 I don't care! I'll drill him!
580240 582120 Get out of here, before he kills you!
582360 584760 - Go that way! Not that way!<br />- This way! Over here!
585000 585880 - Run!<br />- Now!
586120 588960 Run!
597960 599400 Wait a minute!
599640 602640 You forgot to sign.
603640 605160 What was that?
605400 608080 Wait a minute.<br />You forgot to sign the form.
608320 609160 Who are you?
609400 610640 You're not the regular guy?
610880 613160 - He's on vacation.<br />- On vacation?
613400 615560 Well, who the hell is that?
615800 618680 Get in the truck.
624600 627520 You fucking prick!
633560 634880 Are you a cop?
635120 637960 Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.<br />Will continue transmission.
638200 639080 Call 911.
639320 642200 Okay, honey. Let me drive.<br />We're in pursuit.
642440 645760 I'm driving! Don't worry.
650920 653800 This fool picked the wrong time<br />to mess with the wrong lady.
654040 656960 Just stay close.
661680 663520 Right behind you, baby!
663760 664880 Take a good look!
665120 669480 Delores the Road Warrior<br />is dead on your raggedy ass!
676440 679120 Ram him!
683840 686400 - Watch out, Riggs!<br />- Come on!
694120 695480 Are you married, sugar?
695720 697520 What? Yes, 24 years. 24 years!
697760 700640 Yeah, but is it working?
704760 708960 - You can't get closer?<br />- I am. I'm getting closer.
709960 712400 Hold on, Riggs!
720960 722680 Hold on! We got you!
722920 724880 Hold on!
725120 727000 - I told you I could do it!<br />- Closer!
727240 728960 - Get me up there!<br />- Go!
729200 731800 I am!
735440 737920 Back off!
748480 749760 If he falls, don't hit him.
750000 753520 Don't worry, I've got something for you.
789240 793680 Thanks for the interest, sugar,<br />but one thing at a time.
806080 808960 - Catch him!<br />- All right!
810200 813760 Keep singing. Just stay close.
819400 820880 Relax, baby. Relax.
821120 823000 Keep your hands off my thighs!
823240 827040 - He's in trouble. Watch out!<br />- I got him!
838120 839560 I'm getting too old for this.
839800 843200 Not for me, you're not, sugar.
845000 847640 You have the right to remain unconscious.
847880 851760 Anything you say ain't gonna be much.
854240 855880 Hey, Riggs. Are you all right?
856120 859960 I'm okay. I think we've got to book<br />this guy for not wearing his seat belt.
860200 861960 That was dynamite driving.
862200 866040 - She's a dynamite driver.<br />- I'll show you dynamite.
866280 868760 Sho 'nuff!
869000 870760 What have you two been up to?
871000 872720 What do you mean? We were in pursuit.
872960 874880 - I saw you kiss her.<br />- I didn't. She kissed me.
875120 877960 It looked mutual to me.<br />Wipe that lipstick off...
878200 881680 Hey, go spit, Riggs.
881960 883000 Are you okay?
883240 884840 Are you all right?
885080 887040 Back to bed. Back to bed.
887280 889320 Good morning, guys. Daddy.
889560 893200 How about treating your dad<br />to breakfast today?
893440 897800 - You've got six more days to go.<br />- Laundry service.
897960 899240 Hold this. Hangers?
899480 902680 I'm springing for the soap.<br />Nothing too fancy. Cute dog.
902920 904440 It's a Westie.
904680 906280 'Morning, Trish.
906520 908240 'Morning, Rog.
908480 910000 - Good morning, Nick.<br />- Spare me.
910240 912680 - What, you didn't brush your teeth?<br />- Hold it, mister.
912920 914600 Just looking for some orange juice.
914840 918320 Don't get any fingerprints on the door<br />and put the glass in the dishwasher.
918560 920040 Did somebody commit a murder?
920280 921880 Someone's coming to see the house.
922120 925320 A little mess adds to the charm.
934200 935880 How's this?
936120 938920 Isn't this great? Okay?
939160 940360 Kelly's Pool Hall.
940600 943320 Right, Kelly, hi. Let me speak to Dad.
943560 947240 Hi, honey. How are you?<br />I thought I asked you not to call me here.
947480 950840 - It's for you.<br />- Me?
951880 953440 Who is it? Hello?
953680 957160 {y:i}Hi. It's my first day at work. Are you<br />{y:i}going to come by and wish me luck?
957400 960360 - Beautiful, huh? Come on, check it out.<br />- Beautiful lawn.
960600 961720 It's great.
961960 963920 See how quiet it is here? Listen.
964160 965560 Isn't that great? Come on.
965800 967720 - It's quiet.<br />- The inside's even better.
967960 972480 - It's the people to look at the house.<br />- And our broker.
974280 975760 Just want to make sure.
976000 980080 I'll show you this room first.<br />It's my favorite.
980240 981920 Is that it? Does that say it all?
982160 983000 It's very nice.
983240 986000 I love that picture window.
986240 988520 - It's just been completely replaced.<br />- Why?
988760 991640 A drug dealer came through with his car<br />and crashed right in.
991880 993360 Shot up the whole place.
993600 997640 Son of a bitch!<br />I'm going to cut him off at the knees.
997880 1001040 It's true. It's true. True.<br />Okay, anyway, look.
1001280 1003560 Do you like the drapes?<br />Maybe she'll leave them.
1003800 1005480 - I thought you quit.<br />- I did.
1005720 1009240 - You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.<br />- I'm itching to.
1009480 1011160 Here.
1011400 1012760 Chew on these.
1013000 1016680 I have to tell you this. It's the law.<br />It's called "full disclosure".
1016920 1020280 Anything else you want to disclose<br />before we go on?
1020520 1023720 Now that you mention it, the bathroom<br />has been completely remodeled...
1023960 1025600 ...due to unexpected bomb damage.
1025840 1027160 Hey, come on. It's okay.
1027400 1028680 Son of a bitch!
1028920 1032960 Don't, don't. You'll never sell the house.
1036280 1039320 Okay. We saw enough of the kitchen.<br />I'll show you the upstairs.
1039560 1043800 Wait till you see it.<br />It's beautiful. You'll love it.
1047560 1050080 They're gone. Leo Getz,<br />I'm going to kill him.
1050320 1052520 Son of a bitch. I'm going to kill him!
1052760 1056160 You have to let me, Riggs!
1056640 1058280 They weren't going to buy it anyway!
1058520 1061440 - You scared them away!<br />- They couldn't afford to buy it!
1061680 1063960 - Oh, I see.<br />- Okay, relax.
1064200 1067400 I had to tell them everything.<br />It's the law. "Full disclosure."
1067640 1070600 - You must have heard of it?<br />- I'm a cop. I'm the law!
1070840 1074360 - Get off me! What is it with you?<br />- Hold it!
1074600 1075600 Okay, okay.
1075840 1079680 At least he didn't tell them<br />about the nail-gun incident.
1079920 1082920 I forgot. Did you have a permit<br />when you built over the garage?
1083160 1084120 Permit?
1084360 1086640 Hold it! Leo's here. I'll take care of it.
1086880 1089720 I'll make some calls.<br />We'll get some back-dated permits.
1089960 1093840 - Which phone can I use?<br />- Sunroom.
1094920 1097400 - It must be easier than this.<br />- Count on Leo Getz.
1097640 1100840 You need less aggravation.<br />Come to work with me.
1101080 1104680 Thank you, Leo! Son of a bitch.
1116480 1119400 Did you forget something?
1123560 1124440 This.
1124680 1126760 You wear it. You sleep in it. You eat in it.
1127000 1127640 Okay?
1127880 1129800 Six more days.
1130040 1131080 And you...
1131320 1133120 ...keep an eye on him.
1133360 1135520 Sure.
1139800 1140840 She loves me.
1141080 1143280 Stop fronting yourself.<br />You know what I'm saying?
1143520 1146880 Swing with me and my crew.
1149680 1152880 - I got school.<br />- Forget school.
1154240 1156840 Here comes your pops.
1157080 1159760 - Later.<br />- All right, gotcha.
1160000 1163040 Next time.
1164560 1168080 - 'Morning, Rog.<br />- How are you doing?
1168560 1170480 Hey, Nick?
1170720 1172280 - Wasn't that Darryl?<br />- Yeah.
1172520 1175120 I haven't seen him around in a while.
1175360 1176800 He dropped out of high school.
1177040 1179000 Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.
1179240 1181560 Yeah, I know.
1181800 1183680 Hey, Nick?
1183920 1184840 Yeah, Dad?
1185080 1186680 Be good.
1186920 1189280 Word.
1190440 1191880 "Word", Nick.
1192120 1194720 Word.
1196280 1197240 "Word", Riggs.
1197480 1199040 "Word", Rog.
1199280 1200880 - What are we talking about?<br />- "Word."
1201120 1204160 Four letters. Starts with a "W",<br />"O" in the middle, "D" at the end.
1204400 1206520 Oh, yeah, that word.
1206760 1209200 "Word."
1220760 1223560 - Tyrone, my man, how are you?<br />- Jack, how's it going?
1223800 1225760 - Let's take a walk.<br />- Wait here for me.
1226000 1228520 Look around. This is my dream<br />and it's all coming true.
1228760 1233120 You sank your money into this,<br />out here in the middle of the desert?
1233360 1235560 - Know why it'll be a gold mine?<br />- Do tell.
1235800 1239320 Because no one wants to live<br />next door to a menace like you.
1239560 1242560 I came to do business,<br />not to be insulted by you.
1242800 1244160 Relax, Tyrone.
1244400 1246880 Like houses,<br />friendships need strong foundations.
1247120 1250960 Smitty, come here. Come here.
1251960 1254960 What's wrong with you?<br />Don't I pay you good and take care of you?
1255200 1258440 - Sure you do.<br />- What about the stunt you and Billy pulled?
1258680 1261640 - It was a good plan. It worked.<br />- It worked? It didn't work.
1261880 1263400 You got nailed, first time out.
1263640 1266320 Nobody who works for me<br />goes into business for themselves.
1266560 1269360 Do you understand me?<br />See how that can jeopardize everything?
1269600 1271720 - Right?<br />- Whatever.
1271960 1274440 Especially trying to pop an armored car.
1274680 1278000 Okay, Billy got caught.<br />There's nothing I can do about that now.
1278240 1280680 He'll have to face the music on his own.
1280920 1282400 But you and me...
1282640 1284000 ...we're gonna start over.
1284240 1286560 You know what I mean?
1286800 1288520 - Whatever you say.<br />- Good.
1288760 1292680 Glad you understand<br />what I'm talking about.
1297120 1301000 Now we've got a relationship<br />we can build on.
1301560 1304680 - Employee problems. You know how it is?<br />- Yeah, right.
1304920 1307240 You invest time and energy<br />into training somebody.
1307480 1310960 Then they get greedy and do something<br />stupid that jeopardizes everything.
1311200 1312240 It's a bitch!
1312480 1314520 Stick around. This is the good part.
1314760 1317840 We can put our initials in there.
1318080 1320920 Jesus Christ!
1322880 1325320 Lankershim and Vineland.<br />Where are we going?
1325560 1329040 Right here. Rianne's got a new job.<br />I promised her I'd stop by.
1329280 1331400 That's a good reason.
1331640 1335680 All right. Here we are.
1340120 1343120 - You got any silver, any change?<br />- We're cops.
1343360 1348160 That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.<br />I'll get change.
1356000 1359200 Get down! All of you!
1361480 1364280 Get down!
1379000 1380160 How do you like me?
1380400 1382600 What are you doing with a rubber gun?
1382840 1383960 This is a film.
1384200 1387080 Cut, cut! Who the fuck is this lunatic?
1387320 1389680 - Get him off my set.<br />- This isn't part of the story.
1389920 1393200 - Where did you come from?<br />- Can we get a cop on set?
1393440 1396520 Rianne, I'm so sorry.<br />I feel like a microbe right now.
1396760 1399400 - You really thought I was in trouble?<br />- I did.
1399640 1402160 A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.
1402400 1404480 - Are you a fucking idiot?<br />- I apologize.
1404720 1407800 He's a friend of mine, a policeman.<br />He thought I was in trouble.
1408040 1409040 We're both...
1409280 1410480 He's a friend of yours?
1410720 1413760 Let me tell you something:<br />You're fired. Have a nice day.
1414000 1416320 Fired? Riggs, what'd you do?
1416560 1417680 You're not fired.
1417920 1420040 No, you're not. Just take it easy.
1420280 1422280 You can't fire her for something I did.
1422520 1424600 I don't care whose mistake it was.<br />She's fired.
1424840 1426040 I apologize to everyone.
1426280 1427280 Don't push him!
1427520 1428640 All of you, go!
1428880 1430560 Just take it easy. Don't push him.
1430800 1433840 Get off my set, all right?<br />What are you, deaf?
1434080 1434880 Get off my set!
1435120 1437320 On any normal day,<br />I'd smack you in the mouth.
1437560 1438360 Is that so?
1438600 1439240 Don't!
1439480 1441160 It's a normal day.
1441400 1444000 I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay? I'm sorry.
1444240 1447320 I'm all thumbs. He fell down.<br />Let me help you.
1447560 1448960 I said don't hit him!
1449200 1450920 - Is she fired?<br />- Yes, she's fired.
1451160 1452280 - Is she fired?<br />- No, no.
1452520 1454120 - It's okay.<br />- Does she get a raise?
1454360 1456360 - Yes. I said, "yes".<br />- Good.
1456600 1460080 Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.
1460320 1463680 We'd like you to come back.
1466840 1468680 You can't settle every problem<br />with your fists.
1468920 1471800 - I couldn't use my gun with that crowd.<br />- Six more days.
1472040 1473600 I don't want to hear that anymore.
1473840 1476400 Did Rianne get her job back?<br />Did she get a raise?
1476640 1478440 I don't hear a "thank you".
1478680 1482600 Maybe I should become a Hollywood agent.<br />What do you think?
1482840 1484440 - It won't work.<br />- Why?
1484680 1486600 You don't have that killer instinct.
1486840 1488680 Son of a bitch!
1488920 1492800 - We should've put a bag on the meter.<br />- I'll put it in the glove compartment.
1493040 1494400 I don't do that anymore.
1494640 1495880 Oh, yeah? Good man.
1496120 1499720 It's full. Put it in the back seat.
1502040 1506600 - You really like those things?<br />- These? They're good.
1507600 1512000 You can eat a box of them<br />and still be dying for a cigarette.
1514080 1516880 - Did you cut yourself shaving?<br />- Yeah.
1517120 1518760 Old razor?
1519000 1521640 Old face.
1522200 1525720 You're letting this retirement thing<br />get you down.
1525960 1528680 Spend a few more years<br />getting used to the idea. Why quit?
1528920 1531480 - I've got plans for my retirement.<br />- Oh, yeah, plans.
1531720 1533280 - I do. Big plans.<br />- Big plans?
1533520 1535520 - I've had them for a long time.<br />- Like what?
1535760 1538120 Like...
1538360 1540560 - Things, man.<br />- Things.
1540800 1541600 Things.
1541840 1543360 Things I've put off for too long.
1543600 1546320 Oh, those things. I've got those, too.
1546560 1550400 I see you've given this a lot of thought.
1551400 1553240 Yeah.
1553480 1556960 I've given it a lot of thought.
1573920 1575400 Goddamn it!
1575640 1578560 - What's going on?<br />- I'm pissed off. You need a reason?
1578800 1582440 - I thought I heard gunfire.<br />- Get your hearing checked! Put that away!
1582680 1583840 What are you looking at?
1584080 1587080 Hey, man. Peace.
1607000 1610560 Why'd you call us down here?
1611320 1612520 How are you doing, son?
1612760 1616480 Does your mother know you're here?
1618520 1620680 - Did you do this?<br />- Nice shooting.
1620920 1622920 Better than Billy the Kid.
1623160 1624960 Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?
1625200 1628120 Give it to your mom.<br />Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.
1628360 1630240 - Can I borrow your glasses?<br />- Yeah.
1630480 1631480 Who's wearing?
1631720 1632880 Roger, you are.
1633120 1634800 Why me? You guys should be wearing.
1635040 1636560 Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.
1636800 1639560 I don't need help.<br />I've been dressing myself since I was 30.
1639800 1641800 - Okay, man, just trying to help.<br />- Get back.
1642040 1643600 All you perverts, turn your heads.
1643840 1647240 - Take it off, baby.<br />- Hold this shirt.
1647400 1649000 You're wearing a girdle.
1649240 1651240 - He's got a girdle.<br />- This is not a girdle.
1651480 1653160 This is not a girdle. It's my back.
1653400 1656120 My back went out on me.
1656200 1659960 I hurt my back this morning lifting weights.<br />What are you talking about?
1660200 1661320 I saw him do it.
1661560 1662840 Everybody, listen up.
1663080 1665720 I want you all to look at these.<br />Lovely bullets.
1665960 1666520 Cute.
1666760 1671640 Notice the smooth jacket.<br />Pay particular attention to the tip.
1674680 1679760 Now, you've all seen these vests stop<br />a.357 Magnum bullet.
1682400 1685240 Observe.
1697920 1700640 Son of a bitch.
1701280 1705040 - Armor-piercing bullets?<br />- Yeah, cop killers.
1705280 1708960 Those bullets came from the gun<br />of a suspect we arrested yesterday.
1709200 1711040 They're out there on the streets.
1711280 1714280 Vests are optional, boys and girls.<br />Especially boys.
1714520 1717280 See you, Riggs.
1718360 1721120 Cop killers.
1721920 1724840 Son of a bitch.
1725840 1731640 I think we should talk to Billy Phelps.<br />I'll have him brought in for interrogation.
1738360 1740680 I'm here to talk to Billy Phelps.
1740920 1743560 - Can I see your ID, please?<br />- Sure.
1743800 1747000 William Phelps, armored car suspect.<br />He's been moved to Interrogation.
1747240 1751560 - Do you know where that is?<br />- Sure. I've been there a lot.
1759200 1762240 Same floor.
1762520 1767520 I guess now you're retiring, that Swiss<br />bank account will come in pretty handy.
1767760 1770320 How much you got in there, $1 million?<br />$1.5 million?
1770560 1772200 - $5 million.<br />- $5 million?
1772440 1774120 Well, you deserve it.
1774360 1778720 It's better than those<br />miserable drug dealers getting it.
1781160 1782960 What are you talking about?
1783200 1786920 Don't sweat it. You laundered it,<br />didn't you? They can't trace it.
1787160 1788800 - They can't trace it.<br />- What?
1789040 1792080 So long as I get an invite<br />to "casa de" Murtaugh, I'm happy.
1792320 1793320 "Casa" what?
1793560 1795720 - I've never been to Portugal.<br />- Stop joking.
1795960 1796840 She's a cop.
1797080 1800800 I know she's a cop.<br />She's probably on the take, too.
1801040 1802760 The whole Force is bent.
1803000 1805480 She may be wearing a skirt,<br />but we're all brothers.
1805720 1808920 You know I have nothing.<br />I ain't been to Portugal.
1809160 1812640 Listen to me.
1814040 1816320 Son of a bitch.
1816560 1818280 - How are you doing?<br />- Fine.
1818520 1821960 - Who is it today?<br />- Billy Phelps.
1822000 1822880 Who are you?
1823120 1826200 Fly me. I'm your friendly<br />Portuguese airline.
1826440 1827640 She's Infernal Affairs.
1827880 1828680 How'd you know?
1828920 1832360 I took the liberty<br />of looking at your file folder.
1832600 1834400 Lorna Cole.
1834640 1837320 - And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- I used to be.
1837560 1840360 What's Infernal Repairs<br />want with our collar?
1840600 1841920 We're taking over, thanks.
1842160 1843920 Nobody told us they were taking over.
1844160 1846200 Nobody has to tell you anything,<br />Patrolman.
1846440 1848160 I want to go and see the captain.
1848400 1850880 You want to see the captain?<br />Let's go see the captain.
1851120 1853560 - And put on a vest.<br />- Oh, are you wearing one?
1853800 1857280 Just take it easy, man.
1867480 1870400 Hey, guys. Phelps, William.<br />Actually, his name's Billy.
1870640 1871760 You, too?
1872000 1873840 - Popular guy today.<br />- Somebody with him?
1874080 1877000 No, not really.<br />He's down the hall to the right.
1877240 1879600 Want to sign in here, Sarge?
1879840 1881080 Miss.
1881320 1884760 - What's Internal Affairs doing here?<br />- Don't start. I just found out myself.
1885000 1887160 This is Herman Walters,<br />Chief of Intelligence.
1887400 1889320 You haven't met his daughter,<br />Lorna Doone.
1889560 1890640 Pleased to meet you.
1890880 1893600 The Phelps case has been transferred<br />to Internal Affairs.
1893840 1894520 Why?
1894760 1896560 - I can't tell you.<br />- That's classified.
1896800 1899160 We busted our buns busting this guy.<br />We busted him.
1899400 1901800 Busted is right.<br />He spent the night in the hospital.
1902040 1903920 - He didn't buckle up.<br />- We even cited him.
1904160 1905880 I know, I read your report.
1906120 1908400 Our cases have, unfortunately,<br />crossed paths here.
1908640 1910840 That's all I can say.<br />We'll take over from here.
1911080 1913160 Captain, what is she talking about here?
1913400 1915840 - That's classified.<br />- No, I'm talking to him.
1916080 1917120 I'm telling you...
1917360 1919760 No, I said, "Captain".<br />I'm talking to the captain.
1920000 1922760 - That's classified.<br />- I'm talking to him.
1923000 1925840 That's bullshit!
1926440 1929000 Maybe these guys<br />can contribute something to this case?
1929240 1932000 From their records,<br />they only contribute mayhem and chaos.
1932240 1934400 No, I'm Chaos, he's Mayhem.<br />We're a double act.
1934640 1936680 What are we,<br />required reading or something?
1936920 1938360 As a matter of fact, you are.
1938600 1941120 It's a cross between "Police Gazette"<br />and "Mad" magazine.
1941360 1944040 - What's wrong with "Mad"?<br />- Nothing, I used to read it...
1944280 1945640 You've got some taste.
1945880 1948080 ...when I was 12.
1948320 1949680 - Riggs, let's go.<br />- I'm out of here.
1949920 1951720 We busted him, we can talk to him.
1951960 1954000 - Captain.<br />- Riggs. Murtaugh.
1954240 1957720 Get your asses back here.
1959280 1961480 You'll be needing these.
1961720 1963880 I'm reinstating both of you.
1964120 1966440 - Don't you just love him?<br />- Yeah.
1966680 1969160 God!
1969640 1971240 You really are a beautiful man.
1971480 1972720 Just get rid of the blues.
1972960 1977160 - They don't go with your ponytail.<br />- Absolutely not.
1977320 1978160 Yeah, right.
1978400 1979240 Get a haircut!
1979480 1980560 Of course, I won't.
1980800 1982680 You've exceeded your authority, Captain.
1982920 1985680 - That's not how I see it.<br />- That's how the chief will see it.
1985920 1987800 - Take it up with him.<br />- I think I will.
1988040 1991280 Catch up with them. We don't want this<br />screwed up with cowboy tactics.
1991520 1994120 Son of a bitch.
1994880 1997440 Hi, Billy.
1998880 1999680 Jack.
1999920 2002440 'Bye, Billy.
2008320 2011360 See you, Billy.
2016320 2018080 Sergeant, did you get what you need?
2018320 2022120 Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.
2022360 2024240 How long has Phelps been doing this?
2024480 2027120 - Doing what?<br />- This armored-car thing.
2027360 2031680 I wouldn't know.<br />I'm not interested in armored cars.
2043120 2045200 I don't think she's telling us everything.
2045440 2046560 I think you're right.
2046800 2049160 Boy, these six days are going to be rough.
2049400 2052640 God, be good to me, please.
2053400 2057200 Shit, son of a bitch knew there was<br />a camera in the wall.
2057440 2058120 Damn it!
2058360 2060800 He didn't know there was one<br />in the interrogation room.
2061040 2062720 There isn't.
2062960 2064600 We installed them six months ago.
2064840 2066280 - Every station.<br />- That's great.
2066520 2068280 Six months and we don't know about it?
2068520 2070240 This is the "police police", Captain.
2070480 2074040 "Police police." Very good. Can you say<br />that three times in a row, real fast?
2074280 2076720 - Why? Am I getting to you?<br />- Are you trying to bait me?
2076960 2078080 I'm a master at it.
2078320 2079200 That figures.
2079440 2081840 Baiting master. Great, man,<br />try all the tricks.
2082080 2083600 Freeze that. Stop it.
2083840 2085160 Jack Travis.
2085400 2086160 Who?
2086400 2089400 Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
2089640 2090600 He was one of us.
2090840 2093760 Hell of a brutal cop.<br />He could beat a confession out of anyone.
2094000 2095280 One hell of a dirty cop.
2095520 2099000 I've never seen so many suspensions<br />and reprimands and charges of misconduct.
2099240 2101480 He's also as tough as they come.
2101720 2102840 What happened to him?
2103080 2104040 I don't know.
2104280 2107920 His partner and him were on a stakeout.<br />He went for coffee, never came back.
2108160 2110520 Looks like he's had<br />one cappuccino too many.
2110760 2112440 We'd better brief Walters.
2112680 2114640 Excuse me, cute stuff.
2114880 2117920 - That's harassment.<br />- "Cute stuff." That's you.
2118160 2121400 - Captain.<br />- Boys. It's just the captain.
2121640 2124880 Your involvement in this case ended<br />when Phelps hit the floor.
2125120 2128080 Why don't you just go back<br />and beat your street?
2128320 2131080 - Now's the time to buy.<br />- Not now.
2131320 2133160 - Hey, Roger.<br />- Not now, Leo.
2133400 2135720 - Not now!<br />- We got to talk, babe, okay?
2135960 2137960 You're in trouble. You've got termites.
2138200 2139240 Termites?
2139480 2141400 - Oh, God!<br />- You're infested!
2141640 2143960 The only thing holding up your house<br />is the paint.
2144200 2145080 We should go.
2145320 2147160 Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
2147400 2149520 We should pull every file on this guy.
2149760 2151880 I know this guy.<br />Are you watching "Geraldo"?
2152120 2153400 - What?<br />- I know the guy.
2153640 2156080 - How do you know him?<br />- I've seen the guy before.
2156320 2158320 - Where?<br />- I don't know. I recognize him...
2158560 2161680 His name is Jack Travis.<br />Does that ring a bell?
2161920 2163920 Hands off the clothes. Okay?
2164160 2166480 I'm thinking. Let me think.
2166720 2168080 It was a big party.
2168320 2171400 Someone brought a monkey<br />that knocked over the salad bar.
2171640 2174680 And this guy comes in<br />and introduces me to another guy...
2174920 2176880 ...who wants a favor.
2177120 2178640 - I got it!<br />- What?
2178880 2179920 He's got it!
2180160 2182040 - I remember!<br />- You remember!
2182280 2185160 Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.
2185400 2187440 - We're back. We're back!<br />- Yeah.
2187680 2191520 Listen. Can I have a gun this time?
2200800 2205280 Okay, this is it! These guys always<br />wanted me to do favors for them!
2205520 2209040 Like, some guys wanted broads,<br />another guy wanted Cuban cigars.
2209280 2210880 Your guy, hockey.
2211120 2214400 The best seats in the house.
2215440 2218120 - Where're the seats?<br />- Yeah?
2218360 2220600 Probably by the glass.
2220840 2223200 Does "needle in a haystack"<br />mean anything to you?
2223440 2224720 Why don't we spread out?
2224960 2229240 If we all take a different direction,<br />it'd be like old times.
2229480 2232120 Don't push, lady.<br />I'm on police business here.
2232360 2235560 Just take it easy.
2260920 2263880 {y:i}Los Angeles penalty. Number 15.
2264120 2265840 {y:i}Two minutes for high-sticking.
2266080 2269600 {y:i}Time, 5:15.
2286120 2288760 {y:i}Mr. Jack Travis?
2289000 2292760 {y:i}Mr. Jack Travis, this is the LAPD.
2293000 2294320 {y:i}We know you're in here.
2294560 2296600 {y:i}We know where you are.<br />{y:i}Just stay in your seat.
2296840 2298120 {y:i}Don't be stupid.
2298360 2300480 {y:i}I'll be there to escort you out in a minute.
2300720 2303720 {y:i}There's a policeman at every exit,<br />{y:i}so it's no use trying to run.
2303960 2304920 Smart son of a bitch.
2305160 2306440 {y:i}Just stay where you are.
2306680 2310240 {y:i}Thanks for your cooperation.<br />{y:i}Play on, boys.
2322600 2325200 Come on, let's go!
2334040 2337320 Get out of my fucking way!
2347640 2350240 Excuse me.
2361080 2364000 You can't be on the ice!
2369280 2372320 I got him!
2373160 2377480 You have the right... You're under arrest!
2384440 2385320 Fucking weasel!
2385560 2387240 What the hell's going on here?
2387480 2389000 I'm LAPD!
2389240 2392960 I don't care. You can't be on the ice.
2397600 2398680 I got him!
2398920 2402400 You're all right, pal. Stay calm.
2403520 2405160 Make sure you tell my mother.
2405400 2406480 Where'd he go?
2406720 2409400 Down there.
2417600 2420800 Son of a bitch!
2422280 2425280 He thinks I don't know I'm dying.<br />I know it.
2425520 2428520 - You'll be okay.<br />- I'm dying, Roger.
2428760 2430320 I'm choking, see?
2430560 2432400 This is what they do when they die.
2432640 2436000 Leo, it's going to be okay.
2436000 2437960 My body's numb. I can't feel it.
2438200 2441040 I'm going to die, I know it. What?
2441280 2444480 You're lying on the ice.
2444800 2446920 - That's why I'm cold?<br />- That's why you're cold.
2447160 2449360 - That's why I'm numb?<br />- That's why you're numb.
2449600 2451400 But he shot me. Look at all the blood.
2451640 2455520 - It's just a flesh wound.<br />- So it's okay.
2459200 2464160 He's okay. He's going to make it.<br />He's alive!
2467840 2472200 - Bring him this way.<br />- I can't believe this.
2472360 2474280 - I can't believe I got shot.<br />- Calm down.
2474520 2475560 Riggs, are you here?
2475800 2478320 We're all the same now. We all got shot.
2478560 2480080 You'll be fine.
2480320 2480960 Relax.
2481200 2483880 I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.<br />I can take this.
2484120 2487120 Calm down. We'll take care of it.<br />You'll be out of here tonight.
2487360 2488280 It's no big deal.
2488520 2491000 That's not a good idea.<br />You shouldn't rush this, Doc.
2491240 2492240 You should rest up.
2492480 2494280 A dum-dum wound can be serious.
2494520 2496280 What's a "dum-dum wound"?
2496520 2500200 You don't know? A guy on the Force<br />got his thumb shot off by a dum-dum.
2500440 2502480 From the shock,<br />he was dead two days later.
2502720 2504040 "Dead two days later"?
2504280 2505600 He died from dum-dums?
2505840 2508080 - We'll keep you overnight.<br />- Make it two.
2508320 2509160 Two days?
2509400 2511080 Okay, we'll keep him in two days.
2511320 2512800 Is that Leo's chart?
2513040 2516040 - Two days, then you'll be as good as new.<br />- I should be with them.
2516280 2518440 I should be with...
2518680 2520240 How do you spell, "proctological"?
2520480 2522160 Rectal exam?
2522400 2525040 - No, you can't do that to Leo.<br />- Sure, we can.
2525280 2526040 Why's she...
2526280 2527920 Please, Mr. Getz.
2528160 2531280 You've been shot in the arm?<br />Let her take it. You'll get it back.
2531520 2534920 There's a clock in your room.
2534960 2536800 Does this look like a "dum-dum wound"?
2537040 2539280 - It sounded like one when it happened.<br />- Shit.
2539520 2543240 - Take it easy. Two days.<br />- Two days and you'll be out. No problem.
2543480 2546080 - I'll see you guys.<br />- We won't make a move without you.
2546320 2548280 I thought that bullet sounded different.
2548520 2551040 - Relax. They'll be there when you get out.<br />- I'm fine.
2551280 2553040 - You own your house, Doc?<br />- What?
2553280 2555040 - You don't recognize my face?<br />- No, sir.
2555280 2556960 Watch.
2557200 2557680 It's about time.
2557920 2560560 These doggy treats are okay,<br />but I need some human food.
2560800 2564040 Don't worry. I'll make you the best thing<br />you've ever had.
2564280 2566720 Good.
2566960 2570960 - You ever eaten one of my hamburgers?<br />- I've been lucky so far.
2571200 2572240 Hey, Fast Eddie.
2572480 2574560 - How's business?<br />- Booming. Can't you tell?
2574800 2577080 Yeah, I'm looking at it.<br />Did you meet my partner?
2577320 2579760 I want to cook one<br />of those monster burgers for him.
2580000 2581320 - Go for it.<br />- All right.
2581560 2582680 You'll let him cook?
2582920 2585440 - Do I have a choice?<br />- No, because it's Wednesday.
2585680 2587280 He's too big to argue with.
2587520 2589320 In that case, give me a MacRog.
2589560 2591200 Hold the hair.
2591440 2592600 Did you wash your hands?
2592840 2596200 Keep joking. But I guarantee<br />you're gonna like this burger...
2596440 2600080 ...and you're gonna come back<br />with your friends.
2600320 2603600 I haven't got any friends,<br />you know that, except you.
2603840 2606320 He's a comedian in his spare time.
2606560 2608440 When is he gonna say something funny?
2608680 2610000 Are you gonna put that out?
2610240 2611760 You're finished with it, yeah?
2612000 2615160 Do you mind? Thanks.
2615680 2617720 Sorry. I was just looking at it.
2617960 2620480 Chew on this onion.
2620720 2623120 He's quitting, so help him.
2623360 2626520 I was only looking at it.
2627840 2629360 The first thing is the fat.
2629600 2631920 Everyone says, "Cut the fat".
2632160 2635080 My uncle said, "You cut the fat,<br />you kill the burger". Right?
2635320 2635800 Yeah.
2636040 2640760 There's an art to it.<br />You just can't plop this on the grill.
2641600 2645280 Gently coax the flavors out.
2646080 2649400 Hey, what's the problem?
2654440 2657760 A little pepper,<br />then you massage it a little bit.
2658000 2659080 Just a little bit.
2659320 2663160 "Sweet, sweet meat"
2664240 2667480 Shit, man, feel it.
2669520 2670720 Okay, guys!
2670960 2672560 LAPD. Let me see your hands.
2672800 2674920 Let me see your hands. Get them up!
2675160 2680200 In the car! Get them up there!<br />Let me see both of them! Come on!
2682920 2685440 Hey, Riggs!
2694200 2697960 Don't you love me? Five days.
2704160 2705440 Don't do that to me.
2705680 2707400 - Riggs, are you okay?<br />- Yeah.
2707640 2710360 Who did it?
2711200 2712400 All right, asshole!
2712640 2716280 I want to see your hands, right now!
2740000 2742840 Back me up, Riggs.
2766000 2768760 Darryl?
2774760 2777280 Fuck, no!
2779000 2782400 Call an ambulance!<br />Call an ambulance! Breathe!
2782640 2784320 Please, breathe.
2784560 2785680 Breathe!
2785920 2788480 Call an ambulance!
2788720 2790760 Come on! Breathe! Oh, God!
2791000 2794000 Fuck, it's Darryl!
2794440 2796240 Oh, God, don't do this to me! Breathe!
2796480 2798800 - He's dead.<br />- Breathe!
2799040 2801360 - God, don't do this!<br />- He's dead.
2801600 2803720 Rog, he's dead!
2803960 2806480 He's dead, Rog.<br />Don't mess with the corpse.
2806720 2809680 He's dead. Come on, man,<br />it was a clean shoot.
2809920 2811760 It's okay, it was a clean shoot.
2812000 2814000 He was gonna do you<br />and he was gonna do me.
2814240 2816280 It's okay. Are you okay?
2816520 2818960 It's not okay.
2819200 2822120 I know that kid.
2823280 2825640 I know that kid.
2825880 2829000 He's Nick's friend.
2844400 2846600 - I got it, Mom.<br />- I'll get it.
2846840 2848000 Hello?
2848240 2849920 Hi, Martin.
2850160 2852920 He's not here.
2858720 2861880 Oh, my God!
2863280 2866040 Thanks.
2893120 2895640 Fuck!
2900080 2901840 How are you doing? Taking your vitamins?
2902080 2905360 - Riggs, how's Murtaugh?<br />- He's good. He's fine.
2905600 2908360 - I'm sure he's anything but fine.<br />- Really, he's okay.
2908600 2911840 - I'd really like to talk to him.<br />- That's not such a good idea.
2912080 2914120 The best thing to do is to leave him alone.
2914360 2918800 - Let's get something for your cold.<br />- I know what I'm talking about.
2919040 2921800 - We have to talk.<br />- Talking to you is bad for my image.
2922040 2923920 - I'm afraid I insist.<br />- Oh, you insist?
2924160 2929400 In that case, let's find someplace private.<br />Step into my orifice.
2933760 2936400 - Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?<br />- Hey, Riggs.
2936640 2940560 - Clip any wrong wires lately?<br />- I haven't done that for a couple of days.
2940800 2942720 Next time, wait for the bomb squad.
2942960 2943920 Yeah, it's our job.
2944160 2946480 I'll remember that.<br />We saved a cat, though.
2946720 2949920 Great. I love cats.
2950280 2951840 Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.
2952080 2956040 You purposefully withheld information<br />concerning a case under my investigation.
2956280 2957400 Damn right, I did.
2957640 2959480 Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
2959720 2962400 You had a tip on Travis.<br />You should have shared it with me.
2962640 2963720 No, I take that back.
2963960 2966280 You were required to share it with me.
2966520 2968840 I was "required" to share it with you?
2969080 2970920 I don't have to share shit with you.
2971160 2974320 Schoolyard rules: If you don't scratch<br />my back, I don't throw you...
2974560 2977360 - Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that!<br />- Yes, you can!
2977600 2979720 Why don't you cut out<br />this classified bullshit!
2979960 2981880 Right now! It's giving me the shits!
2982120 2985480 We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.<br />We're both on the same side, right?
2985720 2986600 - Right?<br />- Right!
2986840 2989280 Good! Why don't we start to act like it?
2989520 2991640 There are kids out there.<br />Babies. No brains.
2991880 2993480 But they got automatic weapons.
2993720 2998320 - Yesterday, my partner nailed this kid...<br />- I know about Murtaugh.
2999120 3001960 And I'm sorry, Riggs.
3002200 3004600 Yeah.
3008240 3010480 Why don't you let me in on this?<br />I can help you.
3010720 3013760 I really want to help you,<br />if you'll let me. Let me.
3014000 3017480 What do you say? Have we got a deal?
3019840 3022600 Wash your hands...
3023720 3027320 ...and meet me in my office.
3028360 3031240 I'll be right there.
3031440 3033280 I'll be right there.
3033520 3035240 MAC-10, 9-mm, semi-automatic...
3035480 3038400 ...converted to automatic<br />with 36 rounds in the magazine.
3038640 3040320 "On a sesame seed bun."
3040560 3041840 Very illegal.
3042080 3044080 That gun has a history.<br />Wanna know about it?
3044320 3046680 Tell me.
3048000 3050960 "Killed a convenience store clerk<br />in LA County, July 1990."
3051200 3055360 "Used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990."
3055600 3060240 "Confiscated by a truant officer<br />of the LA School Board, October 1990."
3060480 3062800 Scheduled for destruction by the LAPD<br />six weeks ago.
3063040 3065360 "Scheduled" for destruction.
3065600 3068760 But it never got there.
3069160 3072000 Instead, it found its way<br />into the hands of a 15-year-old boy...
3072240 3074520 ...who fired it on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3074760 3076160 I thought it looked familiar.
3076400 3078200 That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3078440 3081920 ...were stolen from a police storage facility<br />before they could be destroyed.
3082160 3084720 They should be paper clips right now,<br />or license plates.
3084960 3088320 Anything but a gun. Here we are<br />busting our asses on the streets...
3088560 3092440 ...getting these weapons out of circulation<br />and now they're headed back out.
3092680 3097120 By busting Phelps, you stumbled onto<br />something the LAPD's tried to keep quiet.
3097360 3100800 That's why Internal Affairs is onto this.<br />They think this is an inside job.
3101040 3103080 That's right. They knew police procedures.
3103320 3105760 They knew where the guns were stored<br />and how to get in.
3106000 3108480 They even knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3108720 3111520 ...because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3111760 3113840 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />- Or an ex-cop.
3114080 3114840 Right.
3115080 3117520 Travis.
3118400 3121360 And you let him slip through your fingers.
3121600 3123280 That's closer than you ever got.
3123520 3124840 Close, Riggs?
3125080 3129400 Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window.
3130360 3131920 Do you want to go for a ride?
3132160 3133960 Sure, where are we going?
3134200 3137000 It's a surprise.
3140240 3142200 Oh, I love surprises.
3142440 3143360 What is this place?
3143600 3146080 I accessed Billy Phelps'phone records<br />on my computer.
3146320 3148200 He made a dozen calls to this address.
3148440 3150680 That was nice of you<br />to steal that information.
3150920 3152400 - Semantics, Riggs.<br />- "Semantics"?
3152640 3155040 I'm always up for some antics.
3155280 3157040 Let's go on three.
3157280 3158080 One.
3158320 3160320 - On three, or three and then go?<br />- What?
3160560 3164040 Never mind. One, two, three.
3165120 3167680 I've got you.
3179560 3181760 It looks like Billy's grandmother<br />owns a big dog.
3182000 3183720 It's not a dog. It's a horse.
3183960 3186080 I hate dogs, Riggs.
3186320 3187400 I don't get it.
3187640 3190960 You don't get what?<br />It's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
3191200 3195520 I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window." I don't get it.
3195760 3198280 Later.
3201720 3203080 What are you doing?
3203320 3206240 I can't shoot a dog.<br />People, okay, but not dogs.
3206480 3208640 I should try to make friends with him.
3208880 3210960 "Make friends"?
3211200 3216120 Now don't run, because he'll only<br />chase you down and kill you.
3216960 3218160 Here, boy.
3218400 3220920 Here, boy.
3226720 3227440 Shit!
3227680 3230360 Good boy.
3236760 3239320 Riggs?
3242800 3245640 You're crazy.
3263440 3264840 Want some?
3265080 3267560 Are you hungry?
3267760 3269240 You're a hungry boy.
3269480 3273200 Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
3274560 3276640 Here's one. Leave some for me.
3276880 3280280 Very slowly, as if you're not here,<br />just walk away.
3280520 3281600 You want me to go?
3281840 3283440 Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
3283680 3285040 "Guy sort of thing"?
3285280 3288040 Are you all alone in here?
3295360 3297920 Stay, stay.
3298480 3301560 Come on, let's go.
3320400 3321520 How many is that?
3321760 3325440 - Fifty-five.<br />- Fifty-five. All right, we've got eight more.
3325680 3329080 We'll get these later. Let's go.
3331400 3333120 Hi, fellas.
3333360 3336520 What's in all these boxes?
3344960 3350560 Easy, let's not kill him, yet.<br />Let's see who he is first, all right?
3351040 3352680 You have the right to remain silent.
3352920 3354720 Shut him up!
3354960 3358360 "Sergeant Martin Riggs."
3359160 3360720 - Get the truck ready.<br />- Right.
3360960 3362520 So, Sergeant Riggs...
3362760 3364160 ...how did you find us?
3364400 3366720 Freeze! Police!
3366960 3368400 Another one?
3368640 3370160 We need a new fucking dog.
3370400 3372160 Get your hands up, asshole.
3372400 3375120 Get them up!
3377080 3378280 A little bit higher.
3378520 3380560 That's better.
3380800 3383560 Very good.
3385920 3388600 Drop it, miss.
3389280 3391800 Now, look!
3437120 3440080 Okay, I'm on! No, wait!
3440320 3443320 Wait, wait!
3445040 3446280 Sergeant Cole!
3446520 3449640 Get down!
3451840 3455360 Get those cases and kill that dog!
3464920 3466120 Stop!
3466360 3466960 The dog.
3467200 3470160 - Where'd you learn to fight?<br />- Catholic school. Forget the dog!
3470400 3472160 Here, boy! We're waiting for the dog!
3472400 3473320 Hold it.
3473560 3474720 Come on, dog!
3474960 3478720 Good dog. Good puppy. Go!
3479600 3480800 Stop!
3481040 3481800 What?
3482040 3483520 - It's full of guns.<br />- Grab one!
3483760 3485280 - You grab one!<br />- Chicken.
3485520 3487880 Step on it.
3490520 3494280 Get that crate! Come on!
3498080 3502280 {y:i}Hatchett, you said not to worry about<br />{y:i}the police, but the cops are all over you!
3502520 3504880 They got my guns.<br />They'll come after me, next!
3505120 3507160 As far as I'm concerned, the deal's off!
3507400 3510200 Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone.<br />We have a deal.
3510440 3511400 Nobody backs out.
3511640 3513600 {y:i}You said you had the cops under control.
3513840 3515840 I see that isn't so. Give me one reason...
3516080 3517800 {y:i}... why I should do business with you.
3518040 3519480 I'll give you a good reason.
3519720 3521280 Tyrone, this is Travis.
3521520 3525520 You back out now, and I'll make sure<br />only your dentist can identify the body.
3525760 3529640 Is that a good enough reason for you?
3530320 3531760 But I need ammo.
3532000 3533880 I'm out of business without ammo.
3534120 3535400 I need the good stuff.
3535640 3538880 You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3539120 3540520 "The good stuff." Jesus.
3540760 3544440 Time to pay another visit to the LAPD.
3544720 3548120 You look like I feel.
3559480 3561480 Have you got anything<br />I can put on my head?
3561720 3563000 There's a hat in the closet.
3563240 3567880 You're all heart. Here, I thought<br />you'd get all tender and maternal.
3568120 3569880 I was raised with four brothers.
3570120 3574440 We got hurt often, but if no bones were<br />broken or blood gushed, nobody cared.
3574680 3575920 Look, blood. See? Blood.
3576160 3577480 It's not gushing.
3577720 3580040 It was free flowing earlier.
3580280 3586280 Could you bring me a needle and thread?<br />Some peroxide. I'll patch it up myself.
3587560 3588920 Don't touch anything.
3589160 3591920 I wasn't.
3592120 3595200 What's with you?
3609880 3611320 What are you doing?
3611560 3614000 - I said not to touch anything.<br />- It came on by itself.
3614240 3616120 All by itself? What are you, a wise guy?
3616360 3618200 You don't like to share your toys, do you?
3618440 3620120 - This isn't a toy.<br />- What is it?
3620360 3622040 - This is a weapon.<br />- A weapon?
3622280 3624360 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3624600 3626360 What, do you throw it at people?
3626600 3629160 You'll give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3629400 3630360 Right here.
3630600 3634720 - Take a little off the top...<br />- Right here.
3638520 3640480 Do you bring all your interrogations home?
3640720 3642920 - What are we talking about?<br />- It's back here.
3643160 3644720 - Careful, careful.<br />- Turn your head.
3644960 3646200 - Careful.<br />- This?
3646440 3648840 - This scratch?<br />- It feels like the Grand Canyon.
3649080 3650680 Oh, God.
3650920 3653040 Hold still.
3653280 3656280 Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3656520 3658200 Be gentle with me.
3658440 3661720 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3661960 3664760 That's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3665000 3667520 - That's a natural mistake.<br />- What, I have a wooden head?
3667760 3669040 - Look at that.<br />- A knife.
3669280 3671000 Knife? That's very nice.
3671240 3672240 This is all right.
3672480 3674760 That's a pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw.
3675000 3677800 That's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this.
3678040 3679920 Same thing. Third and Highland.
3680160 3682720 - Dragged for about half a block.<br />- That's a good one.
3682960 3685000 Feel that texture. Cheese-grater time.
3685240 3687040 - Moving truck.<br />- Moving truck?
3687280 3688080 Moving bullet.
3688320 3691240 - Moving bullet?<br />- Here. This is the best.
3691480 3694080 - It goes all the way through to the back.<br />- Right through?
3694320 3695800 You're lucky. Was it a.22?
3696040 3697400 It's a.38.
3697640 3700280 - It's a.38.<br />- That? That's wimpy. This is a.38.
3700520 3703200 Yours is bigger than mine?<br />I don't think so.
3703440 3704600 Maybe not, but look.
3704840 3707600 A whole family of.44s on the back.
3707840 3708680 There they are.
3708920 3709960 That's impressive.
3710200 3713320 One hit my lung. I was breathing<br />blood bubbles. It was disgusting.
3713560 3714680 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3714920 3716680 You got one?
3716920 3720040 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3720680 3722880 Right down here. Went through.
3723120 3724480 - That must have hurt.<br />- Right.
3724720 3725520 Not too close.
3725760 3727840 Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
3728080 3730320 I can beat it.
3730560 3732840 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- You gotta see this.
3733080 3734840 - I believe you.<br />- This guy had a knife.
3735080 3739000 You'll love it. He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3739240 3741160 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- Look!
3741400 3742640 No, I said forget it.
3742880 3744240 This is a blue-ribbon event.
3744480 3746280 Forget it.
3746520 3747600 You started this.
3747840 3750280 - Yeah, I can end it.<br />- You know what?
3750520 3753320 You're a very poor loser.
3753440 3754360 I didn't lose.
3754600 3756720 - Yes, you did.<br />- No, I didn't lose.
3756960 3758120 - You lost.<br />- I conceded.
3758360 3760600 There's a difference between losing<br />and conceding.
3760840 3762560 You conceded or you're conceited?
3762800 3764400 - You think I'm conceited?<br />- Yeah.
3764640 3766440 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3766680 3767840 I'll get you a Band-Aid.
3768080 3772120 - Tell me you lost.<br />- I said don't touch anything...
3782280 3785320 You're going to smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
3785560 3788840 I can do better than that.
3803800 3806720 This could be a serious ethical breach here.
3806960 3809160 I never made it<br />with another sergeant before.
3809400 3812040 Shut up, Riggs.
3845440 3849240 {y:i}I'm as hungry as a whale.<br />{y:i}Bring on the food.
3849760 3851480 He's got a sense of humor.
3851720 3855040 Watch this. This is a good bit.
3858920 3862440 I think you're gonna get on just fine.
3867160 3870560 If you could pry yourself away<br />from doggie heaven, I'm finished out here.
3870800 3875240 - You wanna take a look?<br />- Sure. Let's go outside for some air.
3877320 3878600 One for you.
3878840 3880120 One for you. No favorites.
3880360 3882480 I just have to finish the flashing here...
3882720 3885120 ...and the roofing shingles<br />about another few bundles.
3885360 3887440 Unless it rains, it should hold up all right.
3887680 3890280 That's comforting.
3893000 3895720 I like a man who takes pride in his work.
3895960 3897600 Do you know where I can find one?
3897840 3899880 Like trying to find a cop<br />when you need one.
3900120 3901480 We're not mind readers.
3901720 3903400 You have to have a mind to read.
3903640 3904600 Read it and weep.
3904840 3907240 With these prices<br />you're promoting graft in the port.
3907480 3911520 If there's anybody<br />who knows about graft, it's you.
3911560 3914480 - Hi, Martin.<br />- How are you doing?
3914720 3916000 - Hi, Mickey.<br />- Hi, Rianne.
3916240 3918400 What are you doing here?
3918640 3919920 Or shouldn't I ask?
3920160 3922000 You got a sink to unplug?
3922240 3923800 - I got your sink.<br />- Good. Go do it.
3924040 3926840 I'll see you next week.
3931200 3932880 What's up?
3933120 3934840 Dad didn't come home last night.
3935080 3938040 He always comes home.
3967160 3970440 Oh, damn, Riggs.
3971320 3972360 What do you want?
3972600 3974600 I just wanted to see how you were doing.
3974840 3976640 Who sent you? Trish?
3976880 3979040 You're doing pretty well.<br />Trish didn't send me.
3979280 3981600 Rianne came to see me.<br />She asked me to find you.
3981840 3982720 To your place?
3982960 3984120 Well, that's where I am.
3984360 3988040 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Yeah.
3988280 3992360 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Come on, she was worried.
3992600 3994240 Get off of my boat, Riggs!
3994480 3996160 - Come on.<br />- Get off my boat!
3996400 3997720 You're drunk.
3997960 3999960 That's something you should know about.
4000200 4002680 - This isn't going to do you any good.<br />- Give me that.
4002920 4003800 Give me that.
4004040 4005720 Roger, please don't do this.
4005960 4008920 You got three days until you retire.<br />This won't do you any good.
4009160 4011640 You self-righteous bastard! Give it...
4011880 4013520 Don't do this, okay? Please?
4013760 4015960 Give it to me, damn it.
4016200 4019560 What are you going to do now, shoot me?
4019800 4020560 There.
4020800 4023240 Take your finger out of my bottle.<br />Give me that gun.
4023480 4025640 The bottle's going sailing.
4025880 4028840 Son of a bitch!
4031600 4032920 Not bad for an old man.
4033160 4034200 Are you finished?
4034440 4037000 No, I got another bottle in the galley<br />and I'll get it.
4037240 4038200 No, you're not.
4038440 4040320 Don't do this to yourself.
4040560 4043160 You gotta cut this out.
4043400 4045720 Oh, man, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
4045960 4049000 Come on. Sit down.
4049440 4050920 - You hit me.<br />- Cool it, will you?
4051160 4052840 Cut it out. Give it up, okay?
4053080 4054040 Go ahead.
4054280 4055960 Go ahead. Hit me again.
4056200 4058560 I don't want to hit you.<br />You think I like this shit?
4058800 4061240 Hit me again. You think I'm afraid of you...
4061480 4063800 - I know you're not.<br />...and that kung-fu shit?
4064040 4066120 Please, Rog.
4066360 4069560 That kid was a killer, all right.<br />That wasn't a toy in his hand.
4069800 4073120 That was a machine pistol<br />with twin carbines and all the trimmings.
4073360 4076680 He would have drilled you, me,<br />anybody that came along.
4076920 4078360 You had no choice.
4078600 4080680 It didn't happen to you. It happened to me.
4080920 4082200 It happened to me!
4082440 4084440 My God, I killed that kid!
4084680 4085880 I killed that boy.
4086120 4087880 You've killed a lot of people.
4088120 4091320 You've killed a fucking lot of people!<br />You don't kill a baby.
4091560 4094560 You've got ice in your veins.<br />You don't kill a boy like Nick.
4094800 4096200 You selfish bastard!
4096440 4098040 You selfish bastard!
4098280 4100440 You're just thinking about yourself.
4100680 4102360 What about me?
4102600 4105400 We're partners. We are partners.
4105640 4107240 What happens to you, happens to me.
4107480 4110520 After all the shit we've been through,<br />don't you get it?
4110760 4112760 Don't you get it?
4113000 4116160 When you retire, you're not just<br />retiring you, you're retiring us.
4116400 4118440 - You're retiring us.<br />- That's not my problem.
4118680 4119400 Yes, it is.
4119640 4122160 - It's not my problem.<br />- You're the only family I've got.
4122400 4125200 I've got three beautiful kids.<br />I love them and they're yours.
4125440 4128440 Trish does my laundry.<br />I live in your icebox. I live in your life!
4128680 4130040 What am I going to do?
4130280 4131640 - I don't care.<br />- Yes, you do.
4131880 4133160 - I don't care.<br />- Yes, you do.
4133400 4134400 I don't care!
4134640 4135560 Yes, you do!
4135800 4137560 - I don't care.<br />- You do so.
4137800 4140680 I don't care!
4144120 4148360 I don't know what I'm saying anymore.<br />I don't know what I'm thinking.
4148600 4152200 I had three days, and now this.
4152360 4153400 I'm sorry.
4153640 4157440 - That's all right.<br />- No, I'm really sorry.
4157680 4161000 I didn't realize that my retirement<br />was gonna screw you up.
4161240 4165600 Forget it. I haven't got any problems.<br />I was out of line saying that shit.
4165840 4167960 Look, man...
4168200 4170920 Riggs, look...
4170960 4172920 You know I love you.
4173160 4178200 You know I love you, Riggs.<br />And your problems are my problems.
4178440 4181080 Like you said, "What happens to you...
4181320 4183400 ...happens to me." So try me.
4183640 4185360 I'm here for you.
4185600 4188080 I haven't got any problems.
4188320 4192160 Yes, you do. We all have problems.<br />You help me...
4192400 4195480 ...and I'm gonna help you.
4196840 4200280 I do have a little problem.
4200280 4202760 You don't want to hear it.<br />This is piddly shit.
4203000 4204640 Yes, I do. I want to hear it.
4204880 4206720 - Tell me.<br />- This is ridiculous.
4206960 4209720 - You don't want to hear it.<br />- No. I'm here.
4209960 4211720 Well...
4211960 4217240 I think maybe I slept with someone<br />that I probably shouldn't have.
4217640 4220520 You son of a bitch!
4225960 4226880 Help me.
4227120 4229240 I ought to let you drown, you traitor.
4229480 4230480 Help me.
4230720 4233680 Come on in.
4236160 4237360 What did you hit me for?
4237600 4240640 'Cause you slept with Rianne.
4240880 4241680 I did not.
4241920 4245160 - Who did you sleep with?<br />- I slept with Sergeant Cole.
4245400 4246840 Sergeant Cole from Traffic?
4247080 4248960 No, not Sergeant Cole from Traffic.
4249200 4252000 Lorna. Sergeant Cole from Traffic<br />is her uncle.
4252240 4256200 - Okay. That's okay.<br />- Oh, I don't know.
4257400 4258520 Sheriff's Department.
4258760 4259560 Sheriff...
4259800 4262120 We're LAPD.
4262360 4264760 What are you boys doing down there?
4265000 4267320 - We're in the middle of a case.<br />- Yeah.
4267560 4270120 Of Scotch.
4270800 4273880 Let's get out of here.
4286920 4290120 Go with the grain.
4291920 4295000 I'll show you. Here.
4295880 4299240 You're going against the grain.
4302280 4305080 - Like that.<br />- Okay.
4310440 4313000 Are you okay?
4314680 4318120 Darryl was my friend, Dad.
4318280 4321360 I know. I'm sorry, son.
4321600 4324600 I hope you don't blame me.
4324840 4327160 I don't blame you, Dad.
4327400 4330280 I blame Darryl.
4332920 4335880 What's this right here?
4340440 4343400 I love you, Dad.
4344840 4348040 I love you, son.
4366280 4369640 "May he find the peace in Heaven<br />that eluded him on Earth."
4369880 4371480 "And may the scourge of violence...
4371720 4375040 ...claiming the lives of our children<br />be lifted by Your grace...
4375280 4377480 ...and infinite wisdom."
4377720 4380280 "Amen."
4405800 4408360 Wait here.
4412680 4413920 Mrs. Smithers...
4414160 4416680 Ma'am?
4418600 4421560 I just don't know...
4426440 4428680 You want to do something,<br />Sergeant Murtaugh?
4428920 4430200 You find the man...
4430440 4434040 ...that put the gun in my son's hand.
4450200 4453320 Take your mama to the car.
4456680 4458240 Are you okay?
4458480 4460000 Yeah.
4460240 4463040 Who's got the gun?
4463400 4466520 - You got it.<br />- Yeah.
4472040 4476040 - Where did this gun come from?<br />- Fuck you!
4476280 4479480 Ever heard of the word "genocide"?<br />Have you, stupid motherfucker?
4479720 4481280 Have you ever heard of genocide?
4481520 4483920 You fools are killing yourselves!<br />You're killing us!
4484160 4485880 I'm tired of it!
4486120 4489320 You'd better tell me where this<br />comes from or I'll blow your head off.
4489560 4493240 I want to know, now!<br />Where did it come from?
4497840 4502240 Do you see this gun? I want to know<br />where it came from. Now!
4502480 4503600 I want a name!
4503840 4506640 Do you see that car?<br />I want a name, asshole!
4506880 4508960 I want a name! I want a name now!
4509200 4509760 One!
4510000 4511160 Are you crazy?
4511400 4513520 Ready?
4513880 4517320 Watch your hands.<br />That tire will rip them right off.
4517560 4519240 - Two!<br />- I'm getting excited.
4519480 4521240 Very excited.
4521480 4526480 - Your face is going to be a skidmark!<br />- No!
4526480 4528280 It's Jack Travis!
4528520 4529880 That's what I wanted, baby.
4530120 4532280 Three!
4533880 4536480 Wrong...
4538160 4541240 Women drivers, baby.
4545120 4547000 We're looking for your friend, Travis.
4547240 4549280 I've never heard of him.
4549520 4550840 Wrong answer.
4551080 4552880 You're pulling on the wrong string.
4553120 4554800 That's not a very professional attitude.
4555040 4556160 Who the fuck are you guys?
4556400 4557400 Sorry, LAPD.
4557640 4561680 We're doing a few routine inquiries.<br />Have you been checked for lumps recently?
4561920 4563200 Give me my fucking wallet!
4563440 4564720 Keep your hands down!
4564960 4566080 My fucking wallet!
4566320 4569440 Get up! We don't need this.
4569680 4573680 We have a license that belongs to Hubert<br />Bartholomew Smith. Nice picture.
4573920 4574640 Fuck you!
4574880 4577960 Hey, there's a lady here.
4578720 4581680 What the hell's going on here?
4581920 4583960 - Maybe they know something.<br />- I'll go find out.
4584200 4588040 - Want me to come with you?<br />- No, I got it.
4588520 4589960 Maybe I should go with her.
4590200 4593280 No, I want you to see something.<br />She has a gift. Watch this.
4593520 4595480 Good morning, gentlemen. LAPD.
4595720 4596920 I've got a few questions.
4597160 4598320 Are you on parole?
4598560 4601000 - I got a job...<br />- Who asked you?
4601240 4602960 Do any of you know a Mr. Travis?
4603200 4604400 You got a warrant?
4604640 4606040 No, but I can get one.
4606280 4607320 Until you do...
4607560 4608800 ...fuck off.
4609040 4611120 That's not a nice thing to say to a lady.
4611360 4612640 Fuck you.
4612880 4615680 I don't think so.
4617520 4620200 Backspin kick.
4628040 4629160 Are you okay, honey?
4629400 4631920 Just great.
4636800 4638400 - "Honey"?<br />- How are you doing?
4638640 4640120 This guy's on parole.
4640360 4642040 This guy's an asshole!
4642280 4645960 - Riggs, there's five of them.<br />- I know.
4646760 4649360 Look at that.
4655880 4658760 Grabbed his clusters!
4659440 4661120 Let me help her.
4661360 4663880 Stay still.
4675040 4677600 My girl.
4678240 4681840 This PMS is murder.
4681840 4683120 I know what you mean.
4683360 4685760 I've been married 25 years.
4686000 4687760 So, tell me about Travis.
4688000 4690680 I told you before, moron,<br />I don't know Jack Travis.
4690920 4692520 I didn't say his name was Jack.
4692760 4696320 You better start telling me<br />more than jackshit.
4698240 4701520 - Men cross the street when they see me.<br />- I didn't have enough time.
4701760 4705280 I'm not your enemy, Captain.<br />I'm just trying to do my job.
4705520 4708240 - Have you eaten?<br />- I already ate. I've gotta go downtown.
4708480 4710440 - What, do you eat alone?<br />- I'm used to it.
4710680 4712040 It's bad for the digestion.
4712280 4716480 Tomorrow, you'll have lunch with me,<br />but I'm not paying.
4721440 4723440 Are you all right?
4723680 4726320 Two fingers, Murph.
4726560 4731440 - Jack, what the fuck?<br />- Get in the car. I'll tell you on the way.
4736320 4738880 After watching Lorna<br />handle herself so well...
4739120 4741240 ...I'm changing my mind about kung fu.
4741480 4743160 Want to try it sometime?
4743400 4744960 - No.<br />- Come on.
4745200 4747480 You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
4747720 4749680 "Old dog", my ass.
4749920 4753120 Let's try something. Watch this.<br />It's called a backspin kick.
4753360 4755320 Pivot on the right, kick with your left...
4755560 4758400 ...and you whip that head around<br />to catch the target over there.
4758640 4761000 Like this. Get that head around<br />and follow through.
4761240 4762080 Like so.
4762320 4764720 So you whip the head.
4764960 4766320 All right?
4766560 4769280 Thank you. Now you try it.
4769520 4771280 Here's your target. All right?
4771520 4775440 Remember, pivot right, kick left,<br />get that head around, spot that target.
4775680 4777880 - Like that.<br />- Yeah. Follow the head around.
4778120 4780760 Back up a bit. We don't want you<br />to bump into the pole.
4781000 4783640 Just back up a little bit.<br />A little bit more. Okay, good.
4783880 4785680 Mind and body strong, now, grasshopper.
4785920 4787360 Okay.
4787600 4789840 Go.
4795960 4797120 He can't hold his water.
4797360 4799040 Get back to work!
4799280 4801120 Okay, back to work, everybody.
4801360 4805280 Oh, Rog, I'm sorry.
4805320 4808440 Sergeant Murtaugh,<br />you could be experiencing...
4808680 4812120 ...some transitional anger<br />caused by the shooting.
4812360 4814720 Do you want to talk about it?
4814960 4817560 - He's okay for a change.<br />- Are you sure?
4817800 4821040 You look good in red. That's your color.
4821280 4826080 - I've got a little extra time now.<br />- I'm fine, Doctor.
4829960 4830960 Oh, shit!
4831200 4832960 Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?
4833200 4834000 What?
4834240 4835600 It's her.
4835840 4839760 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the good-looking Sergeant Murtaugh?
4840000 4841440 Hi, skinny!
4841680 4843720 - Delores. Remember me?<br />- I remember you.
4843960 4846800 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
4847040 4852000 Actually, he's cowering down<br />on all fours right behind this counter.
4853200 4856120 - Where is the sergeant?<br />- He's not here right now.
4856360 4858520 But he's talked of nothing but you all week.
4858760 4859680 Shut my mouth.
4859920 4861120 The man's on fire.
4861360 4863440 - What's the matter, baby?<br />- A little sciatica.
4863680 4866080 You tell him Delores was here.
4866320 4867880 You tell that man...
4868120 4871000 ...that he's the jam in my jellyroll.
4871240 4874080 I'll see you, baby, okay. Bye-bye.
4874320 4876720 See you.
4876920 4879640 Delores says<br />you're "the jam in her jellyroll".
4879880 4881440 I heard.
4881680 4883360 That's a lot of woman.
4883600 4884880 She calls me all the time.
4885120 4887200 She leaves me notes.<br />What am I going to do?
4887440 4888960 You shouldn't have led her on.
4889200 4893000 Led her on? I didn't do anything.
4895080 4897480 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4897720 4900240 You've got to come see me.
4900480 4902800 We've got to work. Come on. Let's go.
4903040 4906440 - Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />- Thanks, Doc. You're a beauty.
4906680 4909800 - Coming?<br />- Yeah, I'm coming.
4916200 4919240 Good afternoon, Captain.
4919720 4923560 That's good. See how easy that was?
4926360 4928080 I love it down here. Don't you?
4928320 4933200 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4936040 4938080 Give me the lock-up keys.
4938320 4940800 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
4941040 4945080 They were all busted by the same<br />police officer, Jack Edward Travis.
4945320 4947480 Early paroles<br />on the work-furlough program.
4947720 4950720 Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4950960 4953440 You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4953680 4955320 - May I see your pass?<br />- My pass?
4955560 4956440 Here's my fucking pass.
4956680 4959200 - I got shot in the line of duty.<br />- He's with us.
4959440 4960760 - "He's with us"?<br />- I said that?
4961000 4962240 Where'd you get her from?
4962480 4963960 Why aren't you in the hospital?
4964200 4966560 Don't mention it.<br />I told you not to leave me there.
4966800 4969520 They tried to take my appendix out.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4969760 4971320 - Brain surgery?<br />- A lapotomy.
4971560 4973600 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4973840 4975200 What's the difference?
4975440 4978680 The difference is, for a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4978920 4980200 Nether what?
4980440 4982600 Nether... I can't say it in front of her.
4982840 4984720 Point to it.
4984960 4986120 - Here.<br />- It must be itchy.
4986360 4988760 It is itchy. These doctors are savages.
4989000 4993640 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
4994600 4997080 Yeah. With a telescope big enough<br />to see Venus.
4997320 4999040 I guess all they saw was Uranus.
4999280 5001240 That's great. Thank you.
5001480 5002720 You know what I say?
5002960 5006360 They fuck you in the hospital.<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you!
5006600 5007800 When they're done...
5008040 5010960 ...the insurance company comes<br />and fucks you some more!
5011200 5014200 $10 for a fucking aspirin<br />and it isn't even covered!
5014440 5015400 That's enough!
5015640 5016920 We're trying to work here.
5017160 5019960 So, what's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5020200 5021480 Did you guys advertise?
5021720 5024120 - He's family.<br />- Who's she?
5024360 5026280 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- How are you? Leo Getz.
5026520 5028800 - Anything you need, Leo "gets". Get it?<br />- I get it.
5029040 5030200 It's real estate now...
5030440 5032680 Listen, come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
5032920 5034920 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
5035160 5036600 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5036840 5040280 That's great. I take one for you<br />and that's what you tell me?
5040520 5044200 - He could check this out.<br />- That's all I'm good for?
5044440 5046000 We've got something for you to do.
5046240 5049880 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
5050120 5052480 - Sure, I can do this.<br />- Can you remember that name?
5052720 5054200 Mesa Verde, I got it.
5054440 5058200 - Wait. What are you doing?<br />- If there's any shit there, he'll find it.
5058440 5061760 - Who is that guy?<br />- It's a long story.
5066600 5068560 Here are your keys, Captain.
5068800 5069760 You motherfucker!
5070000 5071760 - Don't be stupid.<br />- What the fuck?
5072000 5076200 Take the elevator, get the other guys.<br />Keys. Give me those fucking hands.
5076440 5080200 Goddamn you, Travis. What the fuck?
5080360 5083600 Stand there.
5085720 5088360 I can get faster results<br />than that real estate broker.
5088600 5090840 Leo's not just a real estate broker.
5091080 5094640 He's a pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5094880 5098200 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator.
5098440 5100800 - How'd you know where to find them?<br />- We got it all.
5101040 5102520 The world of computers.
5102760 5105560 You used to be one of us, for Christ's sake.
5105800 5108800 You know what future a cop has? None.
5109040 5111880 Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
5112120 5113600 Pension.
5113840 5114720 Nothing to do.
5114960 5118160 Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain<br />by evening. Not for this kid.
5118400 5120360 Police Department's got it all:
5120600 5122040 Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.
5122280 5125560 It's a one-stop shopping center<br />if you've got the balls and the brains.
5125800 5127440 Not a thing anybody can do about it.
5127680 5129760 You're already fucking history<br />and you know it.
5130000 5132200 Sorry. I'm just getting started.
5132440 5134280 Something's wrong.
5134520 5137000 The program's been accessed<br />by someone from the outside.
5137240 5138560 What's been accessed?
5138800 5142400 After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs<br />moved the confiscated ammunition.
5142640 5143840 Armor-piercing bullets?
5144080 5146880 Thousands of rounds<br />to a more secure location.
5147120 5149440 - That's what's been accessed.<br />- Someone else knows.
5149680 5152440 Where's this store? Where'd they move it?
5152680 5154040 Let's go.
5154280 5156760 - I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.<br />- That's a switch.
5157000 5158720 - Right here in the building.<br />- Where?
5158960 5160800 - I'm showing you.<br />- Something's going down.
5161040 5163040 - Nothing's going down.<br />- I'm going with you.
5163280 5165440 - How old are you?<br />- Twenty-two today.
5165680 5166520 Come on.
5166760 5168120 Have you got protection?
5168360 5170880 - Right here in my wallet.<br />- No, your vest, you dummy.
5171120 5172400 Should we take him?
5172640 5175400 - Okay, but keep your head down.<br />- Stay behind me.
5175640 5178880 Come on, let's go. Quiet!
5189560 5191360 You were my ticket in.
5191600 5195440 It's too bad you won't be coming with me.
5199160 5201640 They got it all.
5201880 5204080 - He's dead.<br />- How'd they get it out of here?
5204320 5206320 - I don't know.<br />- Not upstairs.
5206560 5209360 Elevator.
5210800 5212080 Shit. It's down.
5212320 5213480 The subway's down there.
5213720 5215640 - Let's take the stairs.<br />- LA has subways?
5215880 5219200 - Where've you been?<br />- Read something besides the comics.
5219440 5222960 All right. Come on, let's hustle!
5224040 5226920 Hurry up, guys.
5238040 5239320 LAPD! Come here!
5239560 5241800 Come here! Step on it!
5242040 5243240 Son of a bitch!
5243480 5245480 Did you see anybody or anything strange?
5245720 5250200 - Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.<br />- Split now. Just get out of here.
5250440 5253560 - I'm going across.<br />- I got it.
5258640 5262000 Get rid of Murphy, now!
5265960 5270160 Where the fuck do you think you're going?<br />Let's go.
5279920 5282880 Let's get out of here.
5282960 5285480 Cover me.
5303720 5306280 Let's go.
5314760 5317640 Stay still.
5325800 5328760 Happy birthday, kid.
5352480 5355280 Another baby.
5366160 5367680 Is he dead? Check the body.
5367920 5370720 Get me out of here!
5373680 5376480 Stupid son of a bitch!
5386680 5387520 Stop that.
5387760 5388600 Cut it out.
5388840 5390400 - Don't shoot.<br />- LAPD!
5390640 5391760 Where does this lead?
5392000 5393320 - Pico Station.<br />- Thanks.
5393560 5394520 Not that way.
5394760 5398280 Take the stairs, it's faster.
5410000 5412560 Gangway!
5418640 5421840 Get out of the way!
5423240 5424600 Holy shit!
5424840 5426360 Son of a bitch!
5426600 5429200 Police!
5434440 5437680 Step on it. There he is.
5438000 5440560 Goddamn!
5444040 5447440 Put your foot down!
5471720 5472920 Police!
5473160 5474120 I need your bike.
5474360 5475760 This is bullshit.
5476000 5480680 Sergeant Riggs, call it in.<br />I need a couple of clips, too.
5494120 5497160 Okay, we lost him.
5502640 5504920 Where's Riggs?
5505160 5509200 Keep me in touch<br />with the motorcycle pursuit.
5514320 5515920 - Shit!<br />- Take a right, now.
5516160 5516920 Take a right.
5517160 5519440 Go!
5521160 5523960 Take a right! No, left!
5562400 5566040 This is 6-William-6.<br />I'm at the freeway construction site.
5566280 5568160 Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?
5568400 5570680 Come back to me, Central.
5570920 5573880 Where the hell is Riggs?
5573880 5575320 Take a left here! Get off!
5575560 5578440 Get off the freeway!
5588240 5590920 Stop! Hold it!
5590960 5592600 Shit!
5592840 5595240 Hang on!
5608600 5611640 Where is the pursuit?
5613960 5616360 Shit!
5629000 5630280 Relax, Riggs.
5630520 5633120 Relax?
5635840 5638400 Shit!
5651040 5653440 Just get back. Get back!
5653680 5656000 Riggs, talk to me.
5656240 5658680 Riggs, you're alive.
5658920 5660320 Don't move.
5660560 5662400 Just get back.
5662640 5665360 Are you all right?
5670440 5671840 Don't touch me!
5672080 5675320 Okay! I'm not touching you!
5675560 5678760 Don't touch me!
5682120 5685960 - Don't touch me.<br />- I won't touch you.
5688880 5691800 - Are you okay now?<br />- I'm pissed. Now I'm pissed.
5692040 5693240 - Now what?<br />- That bastard!
5693480 5695480 He's done this twice now. Damn!
5695720 5698480 Son of a gun,<br />I'll suck his eyes down through his nose.
5698720 5701880 That's twice he's got away.<br />Nobody gets away from me.
5702120 5703680 Just relax.
5703920 5705600 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
5705840 5709200 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm okay.
5712680 5714080 - I'm having that.<br />- You quit!
5714320 5718520 I ran out of biscuits, okay?<br />Give me a break.
5720560 5723080 Oh, shit!
5725960 5728360 Perfect.
5728360 5730200 What'd I miss?
5730440 5732520 - What are you doing here?<br />- Great car chase.
5732760 5734640 - Great chase.<br />- What are you doing here?
5734880 5736600 - How'd you find us?<br />- Police scanner.
5736840 5739640 What are you doing with a police scanner?
5739880 5743200 Hello, Car 54, where are you?<br />I cracked this case for you guys.
5743440 5745080 Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.
5745320 5747560 They got a housing project,<br />called Rancho Arroyo.
5747800 5750080 - I know where that is.<br />- Why don't we check it out?
5750320 5751880 - That's a good idea.<br />- Yeah, okay.
5752120 5753200 I'll come with you.
5753440 5755200 - You're not coming with us.<br />- Yes, I am.
5755440 5756440 I'll take my car.
5756680 5759320 - No, you're not.<br />- Yes, I am.
5759560 5763600 I can't believe you did that! I got a spare!
5765120 5766760 - You're driving.<br />- No, I'm driving.
5767000 5771120 How could you do that?<br />I can't believe you did that.
5771360 5772480 Where's Lorna?
5772720 5776080 I can't believe you did that!
5776840 5777880 I can't believe it.
5778120 5780920 How could you do that to me?
5781160 5782200 Did you see that?
5782440 5785720 They're my partners.<br />I can't believe they did that!
5785960 5788920 Do you own your own home?
5819760 5822240 - Looks like we came to the right place.<br />- Yeah.
5822480 5824320 Move on out to Travis Town.
5824560 5826840 Great place to raise a family.
5827080 5829080 Built on guns and bloodshed.
5829320 5831600 One hell of a retirement plan<br />this asshole's got.
5831840 5834680 Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.
5834920 5837000 - Say, is that...<br />- Darryl's gun.
5837240 5839760 - I've been saving it for the right occasion.<br />- This is it.
5840000 5842200 - How many men do you think he has?<br />- Who knows?
5842440 5844320 Maybe I should run over there<br />and ask him?
5844560 5845720 That'd be too easy.
5845960 5848320 Wish I had some grenades<br />or a rocket launcher.
5848560 5850720 Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
5850960 5854800 I wonder what Murphy's got in his trunk.
5855280 5857880 It's obvious Murphy<br />was never a Boy Scout.
5858120 5861520 Not even a good spare.
5863400 5864760 Put your hands down...
5865000 5867960 ...it's embarrassing.
5868360 5869440 How are you doing?
5869680 5870480 Kissing.
5870720 5871920 Fresh ones?
5872160 5873760 Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.
5874000 5875320 No points for those.
5875560 5878120 - How'd you get here?<br />- Drove.
5878360 5881480 I ran into Leo at the police station.<br />He talked to me first.
5881720 5883800 - Any ideas?<br />- Lucky thing we've got a plan.
5884040 5885400 Lucky thing. What is it?
5885640 5887840 I want it to be a surprise.
5888080 5891080 I like surprises.
5894920 5897640 Move it!
5898440 5901680 - Check it out.<br />- Let's go.
5917240 5920040 - Look what they did to Murph's car.<br />- It could've been worse.
5920280 5923480 - It could've been yours.<br />- Worse, it could've been Trish's car.
5923720 5924880 - On three.<br />- Three.
5925120 5927160 Three?
5927400 5929360 One...
5929600 5930560 ...two...<br />- Three!
5930800 5933320 Police! Freeze!
5933680 5936200 Oh, shit!
5944680 5947880 - Let's go!<br />- Right now!
5953800 5956440 What's wrong with you?<br />I said go on three, not two.
5956680 5957800 On three.
5958040 5959160 It's always three.
5959400 5960960 Boys!
5961200 5965480 What are we doing here?<br />Losing our heads in a crisis?
5967080 5969960 Cover me!
5987240 5989840 Exxon.
5992840 5994360 - What?<br />- Count to 20.
5994600 5995120 What?
5995360 5998920 Count to 20 and then light me.
6001840 6004200 Shit!
6005360 6008680 Riggs, it's loaded with ammo!
6020480 6023520 - Cover me.<br />- Cover you?
6023880 6025120 Cover you, cover Riggs.
6025360 6029160 When's someone gonna cover me<br />for a change?
6032520 6036480 What's that, 13, 14? To hell with it.
6050680 6054560 It's the cops. They're burning everything.
6064200 6065040 Son of a bitch!
6065280 6068320 Crazy motherfucker!
6071040 6071760 Damn!
6072000 6075560 Riggs, the ammo! Get out of there!
6089680 6091760 You crazy son of a bitch!
6092000 6094440 Yeah!
6108360 6112040 Son of a bitch. You're full of shit.
6114520 6115800 Stay there.
6116040 6118920 Shit, where's Riggs?
6131040 6134120 Son of a bitch! No clip.
6134920 6137800 Lorna, no, don't!
6142960 6144640 Come on in, bitch.
6144880 6147440 The door's open!
6169120 6172520 I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!
6197280 6200240 Son of a bitch.
6203840 6206160 Shit!
6218280 6220080 Armor-piercing bullets, yeah.
6220320 6222600 Cop killers.
6222840 6225960 You're coming with me!
6232640 6235440 Fuck you, asshole!
6251840 6253880 Get up!
6254120 6255280 Get up!
6255520 6259480 Killed in the line of duty.
6261320 6265760 You'll get a great funeral<br />from the Department.
6270080 6273120 Cop killers.
6283000 6286040 Ex-cop killers.
6294600 6297280 Go to hell, Riggs.
6297520 6300160 You first.
6308960 6311760 Crazy son of a bitch!
6316000 6319840 Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.
6320640 6322320 Just hold still.
6322560 6324680 Get a chopper, man.
6324920 6327000 She had two vests on.<br />She's gonna be okay.
6327240 6329360 A couple of bad ones.<br />We need to get a chopper.
6329600 6333400 You're all right, partner. Hang on.
6333640 6336440 It's okay. Just lie still.
6336680 6339760 Just a romantic evening by the fire,<br />just the two of us.
6340000 6342600 Just be still.
6350760 6353560 Honey, open your eyes.
6353800 6356520 Open your eyes.
6358760 6360760 What are you trying to prove out there?
6361000 6362680 Why do you do that?
6362920 6366120 - Can I take this off?<br />- Yeah.
6366600 6371880 You're supposed to grow old<br />with someone, not because of them.
6376040 6377880 I'm gonna be with you.
6378120 6380160 I'm with you now. Look, I'm right here.
6380400 6383840 We're both here, right? Right.
6384000 6385760 Come on, I want to be with you.
6386000 6388560 What have you got to lose?
6388800 6391200 You.
6391720 6394440 Not likely.
6398120 6401080 - Hey, Lorna.<br />- Yeah?
6402560 6405920 Let's live to regret this.
6408960 6410520 - We've got to go, sir.<br />- Okay.
6410760 6413640 She's gonna be fine.
6416000 6418520 Can you hear me?
6418760 6421320 I love you.
6436560 6441040 "Happy retirement, Daddy"
6441280 6445240 "Happy retirement, Daddy"
6445480 6448120 This is it. This is the day.
6448360 6449320 Everybody? Daddy?
6449560 6452400 I want you to know there's a candle<br />for every year in the Force.
6452640 6454640 Yes! A lot of years.
6454880 6458560 - You have to blow it out.<br />- Come on.
6459400 6460120 I can't.
6460360 6463000 - Come on, blow it out.<br />- That's not what I mean.
6463240 6464640 What?
6464880 6467600 I can't retire.
6467840 6471000 I thought I could. I wanted to.
6471240 6473800 But I can't.
6476600 6478800 That means you're gonna<br />stay with the Force?
6479040 6482880 That means I'm staying<br />with the Force, baby.
6483840 6488440 This cake's about to explode,<br />so you'd better blow out these candles.
6488680 6491920 I want you to know<br />that I'm behind you all the way.
6492160 6493760 - Me, too.<br />- So am I, Dad.
6494000 6494880 It's okay.
6495120 6499920 Well, the streets will be safer<br />for another couple of years.
6500200 6501520 "Word", Nick?
6501760 6504360 "Word", Dad.
6505760 6507960 Blow them out!
6508200 6509240 Hello?
6509480 6511600 Hello! In here!
6511840 6515080 Hello. I gotta talk to Roger.
6515240 6516440 Oprah should see this.
6516680 6518800 I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.
6519040 6520440 What is it?
6520680 6524120 Where's Riggs? I didn't know<br />he could hold his breath that long.
6524360 6525840 I'm taking a bath, Leo.
6526080 6530080 I can see that. And it's cold water, too.<br />There goes your image.
6530320 6531800 Listen, I got great news.
6532040 6534720 Once again, Leo Getz has delivered.
6534960 6537400 Okay, I have sold this turkey.
6537640 6541800 This termite-infested dump is now gone.<br />Okay?
6542040 6545760 All you have to do is sign the contract<br />before the suckers change their mind.
6546000 6548040 Okay? I did it!
6548280 6549680 The house is off the market.
6549920 6553480 We're gonna stay in this "termite-infested turkey"<br />for another ten years.
6553720 6556600 - At least.<br />- Maybe I'll get married here.
6556840 6558600 - Come on, out.<br />- You can't do this.
6558840 6561400 - Out.<br />- No, you can't do that.
6561640 6564200 You can't do that. I have contracts signed.
6564440 6566600 Because we're partners,<br />no commission. Okay?
6566840 6567520 Partners?
6567760 6569840 You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
6570080 6570840 Why?
6571080 6574080 Because bullets aren't covered<br />in normal road hazard. That's why!
6574320 6576240 I want those tires. No conditions.
6576480 6577760 Leo, get out of here!
6578000 6579960 - Don't tell me to get out!<br />- Out!
6580200 6584400 Okay, I'm going.<br />You're lucky your wife's here.
6586600 6588000 Don't come crying to me if...
6588240 6588920 Get out!
6589160 6593280 - Termites get...<br />- No more!
6594240 6596960 Your friends.
6597320 6601120 Ten more years till forced retirement.
6601160 6605240 That's 3,650 days.
6605480 6608760 - Forty-nine.<br />- Oh, yeah.
6618440 6621840 I gotta improve my image.
6631440 6634240 'Bye, Daddy!
6635240 6637960 'Bye, baby.
6645400 6647440 What are you smiling at?
6647680 6649200 Why weren't you at my party?
6649440 6651000 I knew you weren't going to retire.
6651240 6654880 I've been wrong about a few things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
6655120 6656920 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6657160 6659600 I'm smoking to forget<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6659840 6661440 What dog-biscuit problem?
6661680 6663440 I've been chasing more cars lately...
6663680 6666800 ...and when I try to lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
6667040 6668160 Jesus Christ.
6668400 6669800 I'm driving. Other side.
6670040 6672920 I've got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.
6673160 6674360 Thank you for opening it.
6674600 6677080 An old fella like you<br />needs all the help he can get.
6677320 6678360 I'll show you.
6678600 6681360 - Who's a grumpy bastard?<br />- I'm a grumpy bastard.
6681600 6682880 - You know something?<br />- What?
6683120 6686760 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.
6687000 6690640 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.
6690880 6692680 He did it to me.
6692920 6694960 I know.
6695200 6698000 See what I mean?
6698440 6699720 My point exactly.
6699960 6702840 Son of a bitch!
6704800 6706120 Stay away from my daughter!
6706360 6708600 You can't be serious?<br />What are you talking about?
6708840 6710120 I saw you kiss Rianne.
6710360 6712400 She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6712640 6715440 - That's not the point!<br />- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6715680 6718120 If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
6718360 6721640 - Are you getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />- I'm getting enough fiber!
6721880 6722960 I'm spoken for, okay?
6723200 6725920 I'm gonna pick Lorna up<br />from the hospital this afternoon.
6726160 6727360 We're practically...
6727600 6729880 - You're serious?<br />- We've got a dog and everything.
6730120 6732320 I figure I can make ends meet.

6939080 6940920 We ain't seen nothing yet, Rog.
6941160 6943320 - Get me closer.<br />- It's roped off.
6943560 6946840 - Can't see the bomb squad anywhere.<br />- They're coming.
6947080 6949200 Stop here and I'll just get out.

6952040 6954200 Tell me, was it the red wire or blue...
6954440 6956440 - Let's get out of here.<br />- Step on the gas.
6956680 6957920 They'll never believe this!
6958160 6960640 - I hope nobody saw us.<br />- They'll blame us.
6960880 6963960 Let's keep cool. You'd better<br />get your girdle out of mothballs.
6964200 6966360 They'll say, "Back in uniform again."
