281280 285700 Riggs, what are you thinking?<br />What are you thinking, Riggs? Riggs.

290370 291620 No. No.
291790 294250 I'm thinking that it's<br />eight minutes and 42 seconds.
294420 298000 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, have a cappuccino.
298170 301800 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />It's eight minutes and 31 seconds.
301960 304300 - Rog, please.<br />- Forget the cappuccino.
304470 307800 - You know what they're gonna say?<br />- "Get the fuck out of here."
307970 311770 After that, they're gonna say, "Cut the<br />blue wire," which I'm gonna do right now.
312310 314520 - Hey, hey. Wait, wait. Riggs. Wait.<br />- What?
314690 316940 - How can you be so sure?<br />- Oh, it's just a hunch.
317100 319320 - A hunch?<br />- Remember the bomb under your toilet?
319480 322570 - Oh, shit. How could I forget?<br />- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
322740 325950 This is more simplified.<br />A bit more powerful, but more simplified.
326110 329490 - From where I was sitting, I couldn't see.<br />- Forget it. Come on, trust me.
329660 330910 Yeah, so I gotta trust you?

340590 343010 - Did I say blue?<br />- Riggs, you said blue.
343510 344920 - Well, I meant red.<br />- You sure?
345260 346970 We can do it your way if you'd like.

3148350 3151310 Instead, it found its way into the hands<br />of a 15-year-old boy...
3151480 3153730 ...who fired on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3153900 3157230 - Thought it looked familiar.<br />- That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3157400 3161030 ...were stolen from a police storage<br />facility before they could be destroyed.
3161200 3164200 They should be paper clips right now<br />or license plates.
3164370 3167910 Anything but a gun. Here we are,<br />busting our asses on the streets...

3172460 3175000 When you busted Phelps,<br />you stumbled onto something...
3175170 3177250 ...the department's<br />trying to keep a lid on.
3177420 3180800 That's why Internal Affairs is on this.<br />They think it's an inside job.
3180970 3183550 Yeah, that's right.<br />They knew police procedures.
3183720 3185970 They knew where the guns were<br />and how to get in.
3186140 3188430 They knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3188600 3191390 ...because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3191560 3194270 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />- Or an ex-cop.
3194560 3196610 - Right. Travis.<br />- Travis.

3615690 3619610 - I'll give you a real good reason.<br />- Hey, Tyrone, this is Travis.
3619780 3623910 You back out now, and I'll make certain<br />that only your dentist can identify the body.
3624070 3626370 Is that a good enough reason for you?
3628790 3630500 But I need ammo.
3630660 3632580 I'm out of business without ammo.
3632750 3636840 - I need the good stuff.<br />- You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3638050 3639760 "The good stuff." Jesus. Pfft!
3639920 3642050 Time to pay another visit to the L.A.P.D.
3642800 3644050 [RIGGS GROANS]

3656230 3659280 Hey. Hey.
3659440 3661650 You got anything I can put on my head?
3661820 3663200 There's a hat in the closet.
3663360 3667950 You're all heart. Here I thought you were<br />gonna get all tender and maternal with me.
3668120 3670540 Listen, Riggs,<br />I was raised with four brothers.
3670700 3671960 We got hurt all the time...
3672120 3675380 ...but if no bones were broken<br />or blood wasn't gushing, nobody cared.
3675540 3677920 - Hey, look, blood. See? Blood.<br />- It's not gushing.
3678090 3680760 Well, it was free-flowing earlier.
3681130 3683090 Could you bring me<br />a needle and thread?
3683260 3686720 You know, maybe some peroxide.<br />I can patch it up myself.
3688760 3691680 - Don't touch anything.<br />- I wasn't. I didn't...
3693440 3695150 What's with you, anyway?
3704070 3706780 [MUSIC PLAYING ON COMPUTER]
3710450 3713500 - The boys.<br />- Hey, what are you doing, huh?
3713660 3716290 - I told you not to touch anything.<br />- Uh, this came on by itself.
3716460 3718710 - Came on all by itself? You a wise guy?<br />- I swear.
3718880 3720800 You don't like to share your toys?
3720960 3722720 - This isn't a toy, Riggs.<br />- What is it?
3722880 3724630 - This is a weapon. Yeah.<br />- A weapon?
3724800 3726800 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3726970 3729260 What, do you throw it at people?<br />Pretty heavy.
3729430 3732140 You're gonna give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3732310 3733310 Right here.
3733480 3735640 - Okay, take a little off the top.<br />- Right here.
3735810 3736980 [RIGGS GRUNTS]

3746950 3748320 Careful. Careful.
3748490 3749990 - Careful. Oh.<br />- This?
3750160 3752660 - This scratch?<br />- Come on, it feels like Grand Canyon.
3752830 3754620 - Oh, God.<br />- Ah!
3754790 3756250 - Hold still.<br />- Yeah.
3756420 3760380 - Ah!<br />- Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3760540 3761800 Be gentle with me.
3762550 3765170 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3765340 3769220 Huh? Oh, that's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3769470 3772010 - That's a natural mistake.<br />- What, I have a wooden head?
3772180 3773470 - Look at that.<br />- It's a knife.
3773640 3775770 - Knife? That's very knife.<br />- Mm-hm.
3776060 3777100 This is all right.
3777270 3779690 Oh, that's pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw. Mm-hm.
3779860 3782860 Hey, that's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this, huh?
3783030 3785030 Same damn thing. Third and Highland.
3785190 3788110 - Dragged for about half a block.<br />- That's a good one.
3788280 3790450 Feel that texture. Feel it.<br />Cheese-grater time.
3790620 3792700 - Moving truck.<br />- Moving truck? Ooh!
3792870 3794290 - Moving bullet.<br />- Moving bullet?
3794450 3796210 - Here. This is the best.<br />- Bullets now.
3796960 3799790 - It goes all the way to the back.<br />- Oh, hey. Right through?
3799960 3801540 You're lucky. What is it, .22?
3801710 3803210 - It's a .38, Riggs.<br />- That's a .38?
3803380 3806220 - It's a .38.<br />- That's a wimpy .38. This is a .38.
3806380 3809300 - Yours is bigger than mine? Don't think so.<br />- I think so.
3809470 3810720 Maybe not, but look. Watch.
3810890 3814060 A whole family of .44s on the back.
3814220 3816310 - Look, there they are.<br />- Impressive.
3816480 3819850 One got stuck in my lung.<br />I was breathing blood bubbles. Disgusting.
3820020 3821310 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3821480 3823360 - You got one?<br />- Mm.
3823520 3825150 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3825440 3826900 - Oh, yeah.<br />- Mm-hm.
3827440 3830160 - Yeah. Right down here. Went through.<br />- Oh.
3830320 3831530 - That must've hurt.<br />- Right.
3831700 3832740 - Not too close.<br />- Pfft!
3832910 3834830 Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
3834990 3837750 I can beat it. I can beat it.<br />Have a look at this.
3837910 3840170 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- You gotta see this.
3840330 3843090 - I'll take your word.<br />- This guy had a knife. You'll love it.
3843250 3845880 He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3846300 3848920 - Hurt like a son of a bitch.<br />- I'll take your word for it.
3849090 3850220 No, I said forget it.
3850380 3853300 - This is a blue-ribbon event.<br />- Forget it, Riggs.
3854390 3855430 Hey, you started this.
3855600 3858270 - Yeah, well, I can end it.<br />- You know what?
3858730 3860100 You're a very poor loser.
3861560 3862770 I didn't lose, Riggs.
3862940 3864690 - Yes, you did.<br />- No. No, I didn't lose.
3864860 3866440 - You lost.<br />- I conceded.
3866610 3869030 There's a difference between<br />losing and conceding.
3869190 3870860 You conceded or you're conceited?
3871030 3873120 - You think I'm conceited?<br />- Oh, yeah.
3873280 3875450 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3875620 3876660 I'll get a Band-Aid.
3876830 3879960 - Tell me you lost.<br />- I said, don't touch anything.
3891680 3894220 You're gonna smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
3895100 3897010 I can do better than that, Riggs.

3912860 3913950 [GASPS]
3914110 3917490 This could be<br />a serious ethical breach here.
3917790 3919950 I never made it<br />with another sergeant before.

3988110 3989480 Who sent you? Trish?
3989650 3992280 Well, uh, you're doing pretty well.<br />Trish didn't send me.
3992440 3994990 Rianne came to see me.<br />She asked me to find you.
3995150 3997740 - Your place?<br />- Well, that's where I am.
3997910 4002080 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Yeah.

4018430 4020260 Rog, please don't do this, okay?
4020430 4023770 You got three days until you retire.<br />This is not gonna do you any good.
4023930 4026310 - You self-righteous bastard. Give it.<br />- Roger!

4546040 4549920 - And you're pulling on the wrong string.<br />- That's not a very professional attitude.
4550080 4552340 - Who the fuck are you guys?<br />RIGGS: Sorry. L.A.P.D.

4697650 4699110 Hey, Murphy.

4741770 4744190 ...boy, I'm changing my mind<br />about all that kung fu.
4744360 4745950 Hey you wanna try something?
4746320 4748070 - No. No, no, no.<br />- Come on.
4748240 4750240 Guess you can't teach<br />an old dog new tricks.
4750410 4752950 - Hey, hey, hey. Old dog, my ass, huh?<br />- Yeah?
4753120 4757000 You wanna try something? Watch this.<br />This is called a backspin kick.
4757170 4758830 Pivot right, kick with your left...
4759000 4762130 ...and you whip that head around<br />to catch the target over there.
4762300 4764170 Get that head round and follow through.
4764340 4767340 Like so. So you whip the head.
4768800 4770350 All right?
4770510 4772680 Thank you. Thank you. Now you try it.

4785440 4788110 Just back up a little bit.<br />A little bit more. Okay, good.
4788280 4790370 Mind and body strong now,<br />grasshopper.

4804170 4805920 Okay, okay, back to work, everybody.
4806090 4809380 Man. Oh, Rog, man, I'm sorry.
4810890 4812680 Sergeant Murtaugh.
4812850 4817850 You could be experiencing some<br />transitional anger caused by the shooting.
4818020 4820270 You wanna talk about it?
4820940 4823360 - I think he's okay for a change, doc.<br />- Are you sure?
4823520 4827150 Yeah. You know, you really look good<br />in red. That's your color, I think.
4827530 4831360 - I've got a little extra time now, sergeant.<br />- I'm fine, doctor.
4836410 4837410 Oh, shit.
4837870 4839710 Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?
4839960 4842540 - What?<br />- No, her.
4842880 4846050 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the good-looking Sergeant Murtaugh?
4846460 4848550 - Aah!<br />DELORES: Hi, skinny.
4848720 4850930 - Delores. You remember me?<br />RIGGS: I remember you.
4851090 4854260 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
4854430 4858270 As a matter of fact, he's cowering down<br />on all fours right behind this counter.
4858980 4860690 [GIGGLES]
4860850 4864020 - Listen, where's the sergeant?<br />- He's not here at the moment, Delores.
4864190 4866610 But, uh, he's talked of nothing<br />but you all week.
4866770 4868610 DELORES: Shut my mouth.<br />- The man's on fire.
4868780 4870820 - What's the matter, baby?<br />- A little sciatica.
4870990 4874200 Oh. You tell him Delores was here.
4874370 4876240 You tell that man...
4876410 4878450 ...that he's the jam in my jelly roll.
4878620 4879660 [BOTH LAUGH]
4879830 4883210 - I'll see you, baby, okay? Bye-bye.<br />- Okay. Bye.
4884210 4885290 [CLEARS THROAT]
4885460 4888340 Delores says that you're<br />the jam in her jelly roll. That's...
4888500 4890340 - I heard.<br />- Heh.
4890510 4892430 - That's a lot of woman there.<br />- Shit.
4892590 4896300 She calls me all the time. And she leaves<br />me notes. What am I gonna do?
4896470 4899970 - You shouldn't have led her on.<br />- Led her on? I didn't do anything, Riggs.
4900140 4904150 I mean, if Trish finds out about it...<br />I didn't... I didn't...
4904480 4907150 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4907320 4909940 You've gotta come see me.

4930170 4933300 JACK: That's good, Murphy.<br />See how easy that was?
4937300 4939060 I love it down here, don't you, Murph?
4939220 4943480 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4947190 4949020 MURPHY:<br />Give me the lock-up keys.
4949570 4952360 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.

4954700 4956780 ...Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
4956950 4958700 Early paroles<br />on the work furlough program.
4958870 4962370 Uh-huh. Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4962540 4965290 Just a minute. You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4965460 4966710 - What?<br />- May I see your pass?
4966870 4968670 - Wanna see? Here's my pass.<br />- I do.
4968840 4971420 - I got shot in the line of duty, okay?<br />- He's with us.
4971590 4973130 - He's with us?<br />- Did I say that?
4973300 4976550 - Where'd you get her from?<br />- What are you doing out of the hospital?
4976720 4979220 Don't mention the hospital.<br />I told you not to leave me.
4979390 4981970 They tried to take my appendix.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4982140 4984100 - Brain surgery?<br />- No, a lapotomy.
4984270 4986560 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4986730 4987770 What's the difference?
4987940 4992020 The difference is, when you get a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4992190 4995360 - Nether what?<br />- Your nether... I can't say it in front of her.
4995530 4996990 Well, point to it.
4997240 4998280 [SCOFFS]
4998450 4999740 - Okay. Here.<br />- Must be itchy.
4999910 5002330 Yes, it is itchy.<br />These doctors are savages.
5002490 5005580 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
5005750 5007250 Huh? Huh?

5008620 5011090 Yeah. With a telescope<br />big enough to see Venus.
5011250 5012920 I guess all they saw was Uranus, huh?
5013090 5015260 Oh, that's great. Huh-huh.<br />That's great. Thank you.
5015420 5016840 - You know what I say?<br />- What?
5017010 5020760 They fuck you in the hospital!<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you.
5020930 5022140 And when they're done...
5022310 5025390 ...along comes the insurance company,<br />and fucks you some more.
5025560 5028600 Ten dollars for a fucking aspirin,<br />that's not even covered.
5028770 5030060 - Leo!<br />- That's enough.

5031940 5034780 What's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5034940 5036530 You take an ad out in the paper?
5036690 5039280 - He's family. We gotta go somewhere else.<br />- Who's she?
5039450 5041570 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Hey, how are you? Leo Getz.
5041740 5043450 Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?

5050580 5052170 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5052340 5055630 That's great. I take one for you,<br />and that's what you tell me?
5055800 5059130 - He could check this out.<br />- That's all I'm good for? Takes slugs...
5059300 5061930 Leo, Leo, Leo. Look.<br />We got something for you to do.
5062090 5065600 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.

5068640 5070480 Right around... Mesa Verde, I got it.
5070650 5072980 What are you doing giving him<br />Mesa Verde?
5073150 5074980 If there's shit there, he'll dig it up.
5075150 5077030 - Who is that guy?<br />RIGGS: It's a long story.
5083320 5084740 Here are your keys, captain.
5084910 5085990 [SILENCED GUNSHOT]

5093580 5097130 Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.
5097800 5099880 Stand there.
5103300 5105810 I can get faster results<br />than that real-estate broker.
5105970 5108720 Leo's not just a real-estate broker.
5108890 5111770 Yeah, he's a royal pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5112810 5116400 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator, guys.

6565640 6569350 But, um, Dad, I want you to know<br />that I'm behind you all the way.
6570020 6571890 CARRIE: Yeah, me too.<br />RIANNE: So am I, Dad.
6572060 6574310 - It's okay.<br />- Well, the streets will be safer...
6574480 6575570 ...for another couple years.
6575730 6577480 [ALL LAUGH]
6578400 6581110 - Word, Nick.<br />- Word, Dad.
6584200 6585740 Blow them out.
6586780 6587950 LEO:<br />Hello?
6588120 6590330 TRISH: Hello. Up here!<br />LEO: Hello?
6590500 6593920 - Hello. Hey, I gotta talk to Roger.<br />TRISH: Leo.
6594080 6595170 Oprah should see this.
6595330 6597840 I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.
6598000 6599460 TRISH:<br />Leo, what is it?
6599630 6602630 Where's Riggs? I didn't know<br />he could hold his breath that long.
6602800 6604840 - Okay, okay.<br />- I'm taking a bath, Leo.
6605010 6607970 I can see that. And it's cold water too.<br />There goes your image.
6608140 6611060 TRISH: Leo.<br />LEO: Listen, I got great news, okay?
6611230 6614400 Okay? Once again,<br />Leo Getz has delivered.
6614560 6616690 Okay, I have sold this turkey.
6617570 6621990 This termite-infested dump<br />is now gone. Okay?
6622150 6625530 You have to sign the contract<br />before the suckers change their mind.
6625700 6626910 Okay? I did it. I did it.
6627070 6628530 MURTAUGH: Hey, hey. Leo, Leo.<br />- What?
6628700 6630200 The house is off the market.
6630370 6634330 We're gonna stay in this termite-infested<br />turkey for another 10 years.
6634500 6636460 TRISH: At least.<br />RIANNE: I'll get married in here.
6636630 6639130 TRISH: Come on, you guys. Come on, out.<br />LEO: You can't do this.
6639300 6641090 TRISH: Out, out.<br />LEO: No, you can't do that.
6641260 6643880 RIANNE: You too, Leo.<br />LEO: You can't do that.
6644050 6645220 I have contracts signed.
6645380 6647640 Because we're partners,<br />no commission. Okay?
6647800 6651350 - Partners?<br />- You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
6651520 6652560 MURTAUGH: Why?<br />- Why?
6652730 6655390 Bullets aren't covered in normal<br />road hazard. That's why.
6655560 6659230 - I want those tires! No conditions!<br />- Oh, God. Leo, get out of here.
6659400 6661900 - Don't tell me to get out!<br />- Get out. Leo, out, out!
6662070 6664200 You're lucky your wife's here.<br />You're lucky...
6664360 6665400 TRISH: Out!<br />LEO: Okay.
6665570 6666740 [DOOR CLOSES]
6668620 6670910 - Don't come to me if the...<br />- Get out!
6671080 6673960 LEO: Termites get... Okay, okay.<br />TRISH: No more!
6676460 6679250 - Your friends.<br />- Yeah.
6679710 6682630 Ten more years<br />till forced retirement, huh, baby?
6683800 6687970 That's, uh, 3650 days.
6688140 6690930 - Forty-nine.<br />- Oh, yeah.
6694810 6696230 [TRISH SCREAMS]
6696390 6698730 [TRISH LAUGHING]
6701730 6703820 - I'll try and improve my image.<br />- Mm.
6706320 6708240 [WHISTLING]
6708910 6710070 [SIGHS]
6710740 6714620 - See you soon. Thanks a lot.<br />RIGGS: Don't mention it.
6714790 6716790 Oh, bye, Daddy.
6719130 6720630 Bye, baby.
6727550 6729180 [RIGGS CHUCKLES]
6729800 6732350 - What are you smiling at?<br />- Heh.
6732510 6735680 - Why weren't you at my party, huh?<br />- I knew you weren't gonna retire.
6735850 6739600 I've been wrong about a couple things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
6739770 6741940 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6742110 6744730 I'm smoking to take my mind off<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6744900 6747950 - What dog-biscuit problem?<br />- I've been chasing more cars lately...
6748110 6751160 ...and, uh, when I try and lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
6751660 6755450 Jesus Christ. Hey, hey, hey.<br />I'm driving. Other side.
6755620 6758540 I got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.
6758710 6760210 Thank you for opening the door.
6760370 6763880 - Need some help? An old fella like you...<br />- I'll show you a fella my age.
6764050 6765880 - Who's a grumpy bastard?<br />- I'm a grumpy bastard.
6766050 6767130 [RIGGS CHUCKLES]
6767300 6768840 - You know something, Riggs?<br />- What?
6769010 6772760 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.
6773300 6776850 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.
6777020 6778350 Well, he did it to me.
6779440 6780850 I know.
6781600 6783060 See what I mean?
6785190 6788440 - My point, exactly.<br />- Son of a bitch. Shit.
6791740 6793240 Stay away from my daughter.
6793410 6795700 RIGGS: You can't be serious.<br />What are you talking about?
6795870 6797700 MURTAUGH:<br />I saw what it was. You kissed Rianne.
6797870 6799710 RIGGS:<br />She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6799870 6802830 MURTAUGH: That's not the point.<br />RIGGS: It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6803000 6805630 MURTAUGH: If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
6805800 6808840 RIGGS: Getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />MURTAUGH: I'm getting enough fiber.
6809010 6810380 RIGGS:<br />I'm spoken for, okay?
6810550 6813180 I'm gonna pick Lorna up<br />from the hospital this afternoon.
6813340 6815220 MURTAUGH: Yeah?<br />RIGGS: Yeah, we're practically...
6815390 6817810 MURTAUGH: You're serious?<br />RIGGS: We got a dog and everything.
6817970 6820600 I figure I can, uh, you know,<br />make ends meet.
6829240 6832410 DISPATCHER: [OVER RADIO]<br /><i>All units. All units. Code 2, high.</i>
6832570 6835200 MURTAUGH: Hey, don't even think<br />about it, Riggs. Don't even try.
6835370 6838490 RIGGS: This is us, rolling to Code 2, high,<br />at Verrina Place.
6838660 6841460 MURTAUGH: Shit, Riggs.<br />This time we wait for the bomb squad.
6841620 6844210 RIGGS: You think I want to end up<br />in uniform again?
7026810 7030980 DISPATCHER: [OVER RADIO] <i>20-William-12,<br />the REA bomb squad's en route. All units.</i>

7036070 7038070 RIGGS:<br />Ah, we ain't seen nothing yet, though, Rog.
7038240 7040780 - Come on, just get me up there closer.<br />MURTAUGH: It's roped off.
7040950 7043320 RIGGS: Can't see the bomb squad.<br />MURTAUGH: They're coming.
7043490 7046450 RIGGS: Okay, all right. All right.<br />Stop here and I'll just get out.
7046620 7049370 MURTAUGH: No, don't get out<br />of the car, Riggs. No. Riggs!
7049540 7051830 RIGGS:<br />Tell me, Rog, was it red wire, blue...?
7052080 7054290 Let's get out of here!<br />Step on the gas.
7054460 7055880 MURTAUGH:<br />They'll never believe this.
7056050 7058630 RIGGS: I hope nobody saw us.<br />MURTAUGH: They'll blame me.
7058800 7062050 RIGGS: Let's keep cool. You better get<br />your girdle out of mothballs.
7062220 7064050 MURTAUGH:<br />They'll say, "Back in uniform again."
7064220 7066850 RIGGS: Find one that fits.<br />MURTAUGH: Ten more years of this.
7067010 7067970 RIGGS & MURTAUGH: [IN UNISON]<br />I'm too old for this shit.
