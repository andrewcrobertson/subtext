101386 102678 Riggs, Homicide.
102846 104430 - Nobody's dead.<br />- Night's young.
104197 105698 This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
105866 107408 - Threat or scare?<br />- The real thing.
107576 108993 This gentleman saw the device.
109161 112288 On Level 1, near the gas pumps.<br />I wrote the license plate down.
112456 114123 That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
114291 116417 - Have you evacuated the building?<br />- It's clean.
116585 118002 - Bomb squad?<br />- On their way.
118170 120338 - It's under control. Let's go.<br />- Bomb squad?
120505 122381 Rog, I think we ought to check this out.
122549 125009 - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />- What?
125385 127511 - Bomb squad's on their way.<br />- There's no bomb.
127679 130139 - How can you be sure?<br />- Because it's a full moon.
130307 132516 Moon, lunar, lunatics.<br />They're everywhere.
132684 134352 - Hey, is that Greek?<br />- No, no. Latin.
134519 136687 Latin. Man, you surprise<br />the shit out of me.
136855 139065 There's no bomb.<br />It's probably a false alarm.
139232 141525 It happens. Probably saw<br />a radio on the back seat.
141693 144445 Hey, hey. Let's not mess with this.<br />Wait for the bomb squad.
144613 146822 You're right.<br />You sit tight, I'll be right back.
146990 149575 - Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />- What's the matter with you?
149743 151994 - There's a bomb in that building.<br />- There's not.
152162 153788 - There's a bomb!<br />- There is not.
153956 156457 There's a bomb in that building!<br />Know how come I know?
156625 158501 - How?<br />- I got eight days to retirement.
158669 160503 And I will not make a stupid mistake.
160671 161754 There is no bomb.
161922 165716 I will bet vital parts of my anatomy<br />to the fact. Now, look. Look.
165884 168260 Trust me. Okay? Trust me.
171765 174058 That's usually my first mistake.
174726 176185 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Yo.
176353 177895 Hey, wait. I'm coming.
178063 179397 - Hey, Rog?<br />- Yeah?
179564 182108 - Your insurance paid up?<br />- Yeah, of course. Why?
182567 186195 - There could be a bomb in here.<br />- Oh, God.
188073 189115 I hate it when I'm right.
190492 193744 - You ought to learn to trust your instincts.<br />- Oh, God.
193912 196539 First impression<br />can often be the right one.
197874 201335 Leak in his diff. About to drop his<br />drive shaft. No wonder there's a bomb.
201503 203295 Just don't touch it.
204631 206090 Just looking.
207300 208884 Right.
211430 215099 What are you gonna do?<br />Don't open the door. Don't open the door!
219271 220771 Son of a bitch, just look at it.
220939 223774 - Just look at it.<br />- That's all I'm gonna do, is look.
226528 228863 Oh, my. There's more plastic than Cher.
229156 232616 I love this job. This is amateur night.<br />Open the door. I can't hear you.
233035 234618 Open the door.
234995 236328 Don't do nothing.
237622 239248 Not that one! Mm-mm!
239416 240708 You son of a bitch.
240876 244045 Well, this is a pretty shonky job.<br />I can dismantle it.
244212 246881 It looks like Beirut to me.<br />Let's get the hell out of here.
250635 253804 Everybody's outside. Just me, you<br />and this cat are dumb enough to be here.
253972 256223 Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh? Heh.
257184 260186 - Relax, Rog. Relax. Right.<br />- Don't do nothing.
260353 262313 We got nine minutes<br />and seven seconds left.
262481 263981 - Know what we could do?<br />- What?
264149 267026 - We could drive this out.<br />- Fine, it's your turn to drive.
267194 269070 No keys. Tsk, tsk. I could hot-wire it.
269237 272490 Aah! Don't even say "hot-wire"<br />around this stuff, man.
272657 275743 - You're right, you're right.<br />- Why am I doing this? Why am I...?
275911 278913 Looks like we're gonna have to do it<br />the old-fashioned way.
279081 283501 Riggs, what are you thinking?<br />What are you thinking, Riggs? Riggs.
283668 285920 - I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.<br />- Wait!
286088 288005 - That's not what I think.<br />- You think red?
288173 289423 No. No.
289591 292051 I'm thinking that it's<br />eight minutes and 42 seconds.
292219 295805 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, have a cappuccino.
295972 299600 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />It's eight minutes and 31 seconds.
299768 302103 - Rog, please.<br />- Forget the cappuccino.
302270 305606 - You know what they're gonna say?<br />- "Get the fuck out of here. "
305774 309568 After that, they're gonna say, "Cut the<br />blue wire," which I'm gonna do right now.
310112 312321 - Hey, hey. Wait, wait. Riggs. Wait.<br />- What?
312489 314740 - How can you be so sure?<br />- Oh, it's just a hunch.
314908 317118 - A hunch?<br />- Remember the bomb under your toilet?
317285 320371 - Oh, shit. How could I forget?<br />- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
320539 323749 This is more simplified.<br />A bit more powerful, but more simplified.
323917 327294 - From where I was sitting, I couldn't see.<br />- Forget it. Come on, trust me.
327462 328712 Yeah, so I gotta trust you?
328880 331632 Guess not.<br />Well, I'm cutting the red wire, okay?
331800 333968 Oh! Oh!
334136 337555 - What? What?<br />- A minute ago you said blue.
338390 340808 - Did I say blue?<br />- Riggs, you said blue.
341309 342726 - Well, I meant red.<br />- You sure?
343061 344770 We can do it your way if you'd like.
344938 347064 - My way? I don't have...!<br />- Quiet!
347232 350568 - I'm sure, okay?<br />- Shit.
352529 354363 You ready?
354531 356240 - Rog?<br />- What?
356741 359952 Won't you kind of miss all this good stuff<br />when you retire?
360120 362913 Aren't you gonna miss it a little bit? Huh?
364958 366375 I'm cutting the wire.
367169 368210 Snip. See? All done.
370839 372715 - Rog.<br />- Yeah?
373925 376510 - Grab the cat.<br />- Grab the cat?
376678 379597 Get back! Take cover!
439532 440991 Where are they?
446456 447873 Bravo.
452837 454171 Oops.
455715 457383 Right. Oops.
459844 461720 Right.
466726 469728 Seven days to retirement,<br />I'm busted down to patrolman.
469896 472356 I should've cut the red wire.
472524 474608 - You did.<br />- No, I didn't. I cut the blue wire.
474776 477861 That's what I meant.<br />We should've waited for the bomb squad.
478029 479697 Am I gonna have to listen to this?
479864 482408 - Every day until I retire.<br />- That'll be a week too long.
482575 483867 Ah, shit.
484035 486287 - My feet are killing me.<br />- They're killing me too.
486454 488872 - How?<br />- I gotta listen to you bitch about them!
489040 493419 - Because you should've cut the red wire!<br />- I did cut the red wire!
493962 497172 What's this? It's kind of soft.<br />It's not a bulletproof vest.
497340 500217 - It's not gonna keep anything out.<br />- Gonna keep my stomach in.
500593 502553 What do you got under there?
503054 505472 - It's a girdle.<br />- What?
505974 507933 Oh, God. It's a girdle.
508893 510019 Trish know about this?
510186 511979 Not a woman's girdle, a man's girdle.
512147 514690 - They make girdles for men?<br />- They make girdles for men.
514858 516191 - They do, huh?<br />- Yeah, they do.
516359 519570 I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.<br />Cleaners must have shrunk it.
519738 521280 Well, you should take it to Chin.
521448 524491 I did take it to Chin over in Alpine.<br />Look at it. It's shrunk all up in here.
526286 528245 - Have to hold my breath.<br />- Did you see that?
528413 530748 - See what?<br />- Jaywalker.
531499 532624 Jaywalking?
533126 535252 Hold it right there, pal.<br />Step up here, please.
535420 536754 - Me?<br />- Yes, you.
536921 538505 - What did I do?<br />- Stand there.
538673 541633 What'd you do? Jaywalking.<br />I saw you. I have to cite you.
541801 543844 Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on.
544012 546263 Can you handle this<br />or should I radio for backup?
546431 548932 - Got the ticket book?<br />- People are committing crimes...
549100 551435 - ... and you're hassling me?<br />- Shut up!
551603 552644 Yeah.
554522 555564 Oh!
555732 559318 - Do you know how to fill one of these out?<br />- A long time ago. Let me see.
559486 561278 Can't read it. The print is little.
561446 563197 - Without my glasses.<br />- You're no help.
563365 566617 Can we speed this up? You may<br />have nothing to do. I have things to do.
566785 569661 No, we can't, so will you shut up?
569829 571955 - Jaywalking.<br />- Ask for his license.
572123 573999 - License for jaywalking?<br />- Yeah, jaywalking.
574167 576960 I don't have it on me, okay?<br />I wasn't driving, okay?
577128 579254 I was walking.<br />What, do I need a walking license now?
579422 581882 - Oh, let's just shoot him.<br />- Oh, oh, oh, what is he crazy?
582050 585052 I'm gonna drill him.<br />We can make it look like suicide.
585220 588097 - Get out of the way!<br />- No, no, no. The video cameras.
588264 589723 I don't care! I'm gonna drill him!
589891 593227 Get out of here, before my partner kills you!<br />Go that way, not that way!
593395 594436 This way! Over there!
594604 597398 - Go, run! Now! Run!<br />- Right there, yeah.
605240 607366 Hey. Hey!
607826 611495 Hey, wait a minute.<br />You forgot to sign.
612080 615416 - Hey.<br />- What's that?
616000 618502 - Wait a minute.<br />- You forgot to sign the form.
618670 621422 Hey, who are you?<br />You're not the regular guy.
621589 623757 - He's on vacation.<br />- On vacation?
623925 625801 Well, who the hell is that?
626761 628011 Get in the truck! Get!
635562 637187 You fucking prick!
641443 643026 - Riggs! Riggs!<br />- Are you all right?
644946 646321 - Hey, are you a cop?<br />- Yeah.
646531 649658 Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.<br />Will continue transmission.
649826 650993 Call 911.
651161 654246 All right, honey.<br />Let me drive. We're in pursuit.
654414 656665 I'm driving, baby! Don't worry.
663256 666300 This fool picked the wrong time<br />to mess with the wrong lady.
666468 667759 All right. Just stay close.
674434 677853 Hey, hey, hey. Right behind you, baby.<br />That's right. Take a good look.
678021 680856 Delores the Road Warrior<br />is dead on your raggedy ass.
689949 691074 Ram him! Ram him!
697749 699208 - Watch out, Riggs.<br />- Come on!
708384 711094 - Are you married, sugar?<br />- What? Yeah, 24 years.
711262 713722 - Yeah, 24 years.<br />- Yeah, but is it working?
719437 721939 - Hey, you can't get closer?<br />- I am. I'm getting closer.
724609 726777 Hold on, Riggs! Hold on!
735745 738330 - Hey, hey!<br />- Hold on! Hold on! We got you.
738498 739915 Hold on!
740792 742668 - I told you I could do it.<br />- Closer!
742835 744628 - Get me up there.<br />- Yeah, get up close.
744796 746255 I am. I am, all right?
751594 752803 - Back off, back off!<br />- Aah!
765233 768819 - If he falls, don't hit him.<br />- Don't worry. I got something for you.
805857 806857 Whoa!
807025 810360 Ooh, hoo-hoo! Thanks for the interest,<br />sugar, but one thing at a time.
825084 826918 - Catch him, catch him.<br />- All right.
829547 831381 Keep singing, baby. Just stay close.
838723 839723 Relax, baby. Relax, baby.
839891 842643 Ho! Ho! Ho!<br />Hey, keep your hands off my thigh.
842810 845395 - My partner's in trouble. Watch out for him.<br />- I got him!
858576 862579 - Boy, I'm getting too old for this shit.<br />- Not for me, you're not, sugar.
865667 868251 You have the right<br />to remain unconscious.
868628 870087 Anything you say ain't gonna be much.
875426 877010 - Hey, Riggs. You all right?<br />- Ha!
877178 881098 I'm okay. I think we gotta book this guy<br />for not wearing his seat belt though.
881265 883266 Hey, that was dynamite driving.
883434 886978 - No, she's the dynamite driver.<br />- I'll show you dynamite.
887146 890273 - Whoo!<br />- Sure enough. Whoo!
890692 894194 - What have you two been up to?<br />- What do you mean? We were in pursuit.
894362 896655 - I saw you kiss her.<br />- No, I didn't. She kissed me.
896823 900826 It looked mutual. Wipe that lipstick off<br />before the guys at the station start talking.
900993 902494 Hey, go spit, Riggs.
903955 906289 You okay? You all right?
907625 909251 Back to bed. Back to bed.
909585 911962 - Morning, guys. Daddy.<br />- Hey.
912130 915173 Hey, how about treating your dad<br />to breakfast today, okay?
916134 919428 - You got six more days to go.<br />- Laundry service.
920638 922180 Hold this. Hangers?
922348 925851 I'm springing for the soap.<br />Nothing too fancy. That's a cute dog.
926018 927769 - It's a Westie.<br />- Morning. Westie?
927937 929563 - Morning, Trish.<br />- Hey.
929731 931356 Morning, Rog.
932150 933316 - Hey, Nick.<br />- Spare me.
933484 936153 - What? Didn't you brush your teeth?<br />- Hold it, mister.
936320 938321 I'm just looking for some orange juice.
938489 941867 Don't get fingerprints on the door,<br />and put the glass in the dishwasher.
942034 945495 - Did somebody commit a murder?<br />- Somebody's coming to see the house.
945663 947873 Oh. Hey, I think a little mess<br />adds to the charm.
958634 960343 How's this, huh?
960553 962512 This great? Okay? Okay?
963848 965140 Kelly's Pool Hall. Kelly speaking.
965308 968226 Yeah, right, Kelly.<br />Hi, let me speak to Dad.
968394 971646 Oh, hi, honey. How are you?<br />I thought I asked you not to call me here.
972231 974900 - It's for you, Rog.<br />- Me?
975234 976526 Hmm?
976861 978528 Uh, who are...? Who is it? Hello?
978696 980697 Hi. It's my first day at work.

982533 983533 Beautiful, huh?
983701 985994 - Come on, come on, check it out.<br />- Beautiful lawn.
986162 987454 It's great.
987622 989790 See how quiet it is here? Listen, listen.
989957 991124 That great? Come on.
991292 993627 - Very quiet.<br />- The inside's better than the outside.
993795 996546 - It's the people to look at the house.<br />- And our broker.
999467 1001676 Okay, okay. Just wanna make sure.
1001844 1005138 I gotta show you this room first.<br />This is my favorite. This is great.
1005306 1007891 - Okay? I love it. That it? That say it all?<br />- Oh, yeah.
1008059 1009226 - Beautiful.<br />- Very nice.

1011604 1012646 Shh. Shh. Shh.
1012814 1015524 - You do? It's been completely replaced.<br />- Oh, why was that?
1015691 1018652 A drug dealer came through with his car<br />and crashed right in.
1018820 1020529 Shot up the whole place. Shh.
1020696 1022906 Son of a bitch.<br />I'm gonna cut him off at the...
1023074 1024866 - Ha, ha! Leo.<br />- Oh, ha. Drug dealer.
1025034 1027327 It's true. Hey, it's true. True.
1027495 1030664 Okay, anyway, look. Like the drapes?<br />Maybe she'll leave the drapes.
1030832 1032707 - Hey, I thought you quit, huh?<br />- I did.
1032875 1035502 - You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.<br />- I'm edgy.
1035670 1039047 - You're edgy? Here.<br />- That stuff about the drug dealer...
1039215 1040423 Chew on these.
1040591 1042676 Listen, I have to tell you<br />these things, okay?
1042844 1044928 It's the law. It's called full disclosure.
1045096 1047389 Anything else you wanna disclose<br />before we go on?
1048891 1052018 Okay, now that you mention it, the<br />bathroom has been completely remodeled...
1052186 1053728 ...due to unexpected bomb damage.
1053896 1055772 Hey, hey, hey, come on. It's okay.
1055940 1057816 - Son of a bitch. I'm gonna...<br />Shh. Shh.
1057984 1060026 - Don't. You'll never sell...<br />Shh.
1065074 1067284 Okay, okay.<br />So, uh, we saw enough of the kitchen.
1067451 1070453 Let me show you upstairs.<br />Wait till you see this. It's beautiful.
1070621 1072122 You're really gonna love this.
1076627 1079296 - They're gone.<br />- Leo Getz, I guess I'm gonna kill him.
1079463 1081882 Son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill him!<br />I'm gonna kill him!
1082049 1084551 Don't...<br />He's trying to ruin me, Riggs.
1085094 1087929 - Hey, Leo, you got...<br />- They weren't gonna buy the house!
1088097 1091558 - Yeah, you scared them away.<br />- No, they couldn't afford the financing.
1091726 1093894 - Oh, Jesus.<br />- Okay, relax.
1094061 1097397 I had to tell them everything.<br />It's the law, okay? I mean, full disclosure.
1097565 1099608 - You must have heard of it.<br />- I'm a cop. I'm the law.
1099775 1100817 - Ah!<br />- Ow!
1100985 1103862 - Get off me! What is it with you?<br />- Hold it.
1105156 1106197 Okay, okay.
1106365 1109034 At least he didn't tell them<br />about that nail-gun incident.
1109201 1111328 - Oh...<br />- I forgot.
1111495 1113914 Did you have a permit<br />when you built over the garage?
1114081 1116041 - Permit?<br />- You know what I'll do? Hold it.
1116208 1118919 Leo's here. I'll take care of it.<br />I'll make a couple calls.
1119086 1120754 We'll get some back-dated permits.
1120922 1123089 - Which phone can I use?<br />- Uh, sunroom. Sunroom.
1123257 1125842 - Okay, okay, okay. I got you.<br />- Jesus Christ.
1126010 1128678 - It's gotta be easier than this.<br />- They don't know Leo Getz.
1128846 1131723 You could do with less aggravation.<br />Come to work with me.
1131891 1135060 Yeah. Thank you, Leo. Son of a bitch.
1135227 1137520 Stop fronting yourself.<br />You know what I'm saying?
1137688 1139648 Swing with me and my crew.<br />That's the move.
1144779 1146696 Forget school.
1148783 1151242 Oh, man. Here comes your pops, man.
1151535 1153411 - Later, man.<br />- All right, I gotcha.
1153579 1156373 - All right, bro. I'm out, man.<br />- Next time, G. Peace, bro.
1159293 1161169 - Morning, Rog.<br />- How you doing?
1161337 1163463 - How you doing, Mr. Fisher?<br />- Hey, Nick.
1163631 1165382 Hey, Nick.
1165549 1168176 - Uh, wasn't that Darryl?<br />- Yeah.
1168344 1170220 Haven't seen him around in a while.
1171305 1174724 - He dropped out of school.<br />- Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.
1174892 1176393 Yeah, I know.
1177728 1178853 Hey, Nick.
1179897 1182232 - Yeah, Dad.<br />- Be good.
1183109 1184609 Word.
1186445 1188071 Hey, word, Nick.
1188447 1189906 Word.
1192868 1195578 - Word, Riggs.<br />- Word, Rog.
1196247 1197789 - What are we talking about?<br />- Word.
1197957 1200250 Starts with a W,<br />"or" in the middle, D on the end.
1200418 1202502 - Word. Oh, yeah, that word.<br />- Where you been?
1202670 1205088 - Word.<br />- Word.
1218394 1221438 - Hey, Tyrone, my man, how are you?<br />- Jack, how's it going?
1221605 1223690 - Let's take a walk.<br />- Hey, wait here for me.
1223858 1226609 Look around. This is my dream<br />and it's all coming true.
1226777 1230530 You sank your money into this, out here<br />in the middle of the fucking desert?
1230698 1232949 That's right.<br />Know why it's gonna be a gold mine?
1233117 1234159 Do tell me.
1234326 1237829 Because nobody wants to live next door<br />to people like you. You're a menace.
1237997 1241249 Jack, I came out here to do business,<br />not be insulted by you.
1241417 1242751 Relax, Tyrone.
1242918 1245420 Just like houses,<br />friendships need strong foundations.
1245588 1248965 Hey, Smitty, come here. Come here.
1250885 1254137 What's wrong with you? Don't I<br />pay you good? Don't I take care of you?
1254305 1255305 Sure you do, Jack.
1255473 1258058 What's this stupid business<br />you and Billy tried to pull?
1258225 1261603 - It was a good plan. It worked.<br />- It worked? It didn't work.
1261771 1263146 You got nailed first time out.
1263314 1265982 Nobody who works for me<br />goes into business for themselves.
1266150 1267442 Understand what I'm saying?
1267610 1269819 See how that can jeopardize everything?<br />Right, Tyrone?
1269987 1271404 Heh, heh, whatever.
1271572 1273990 Especially trying to pop an armored car.
1274575 1278078 Okay, Billy got caught.<br />There's nothing I can do about that now.
1278245 1280872 He's gonna have to face the music<br />on his own.
1281165 1284292 But you and me, Smitty,<br />we're gonna start over.
1284460 1286211 You know what I mean?
1287171 1289005 - Whatever you say, Jack.<br />- Good.
1289173 1291174 Glad you understand<br />what I'm talking about.
1297973 1300183 Now we got a relationship<br />we can build on.
1302520 1305688 - Employee problems. You know how it is?<br />- Yeah, right.
1305856 1308775 You invest time and energy<br />into training somebody.
1308943 1312153 They get greedy and do something stupid<br />that jeopardizes everything.
1312404 1313613 It's a bitch.
1314031 1315949 Stick around. This is the good part.
1316367 1319661 We can put our initials in there. Yeah?
1319829 1321538 Jesus Christ.
1324917 1327127 - Lankershim and Vineland.<br />- Where are we going, Rog?
1327294 1331548 Uh, right here. Rianne's got<br />a new job. I promised her I'd stop by.
1331715 1333258 That's a good reason.
1334093 1336928 All right. Here we are.
1342810 1346104 - You got any silver, any change?<br />- We're cops.
1346272 1349149 That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.<br />I'll get change.
1358993 1362078 - Where are you going? Get down!<br />- Get down! All of you, get down!
1375926 1378136 Riggs! Riggs!
1383309 1386269 How do you like that, huh?<br />What are you doing with a rubber gun?
1386437 1388813 - No! This is a film. There are not...<br />- What?
1388981 1392025 Cut, cut, cut!<br />Who the fuck is this lunatic?
1392193 1394485 - Get him off my set.<br />- This isn't part of the story.
1394653 1396946 - Can we get a cop?<br />- Where did you come from?
1397114 1398448 Jesus. Who are you?
1398616 1401743 Rianne, I'm so sorry.<br />I feel like a microbe right now.
1401911 1404204 - You really thought I was in trouble?<br />- Oh, I did.
1404371 1407207 - You did?<br />- A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.
1407374 1409250 What is wrong with you?<br />Are you an idiot?
1409418 1410460 I apologize.
1410628 1414422 - He's a friend of mine, a policeman.<br />- Yeah, we're both here to visit...
1414590 1415840 Oh, he's a friend of yours?
1416008 1419802 Let me tell you something, okay?<br />You're fired. All right. Have a nice day.
1419970 1421804 Fired? Riggs, what did you do?
1422640 1426434 - You're not fired. Don't worry.<br />- No, you're not. Take it easy, Riggs.
1426602 1428436 You can't fire her for something I did.
1428604 1430772 I don't care whose mistake it was.<br />She's fired.
1430940 1433650 - I apologize to everybody.<br />- Don't push him.
1433817 1435151 - Don't push.<br />- All of you, go!
1435319 1437445 Just take it easy.<br />Don't push him. Don't push.
1437613 1440490 - Get off my set, all right?<br />- What are you, deaf? Go.
1440658 1441866 Move. Get off my set.
1442034 1444160 On any normal day,<br />I'd smack you in the mouth.
1444328 1446246 - Is that so?<br />- Don't hit him.
1446413 1447705 It's a normal day.
1448958 1451209 I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay?<br />I'm sorry.
1451377 1454587 God, I'm all thumbs. Look, he fell down.<br />Let me help you up.
1454755 1456297 I said don't hit him, Riggs.
1456465 1458341 - Is she fired?<br />- Yes, she's fired.
1458509 1459592 - Is she fired?<br />- No.
1459760 1461594 - She got a raise?<br />- It's all right.
1461762 1463680 - Yes. I said yes. Thank you.<br />- Good.
1463847 1467850 - Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.<br />- Yeah.
1468185 1469769 We'd like you to come back.
1471480 1472855 All right.
1474817 1476943 You can't settle every problem<br />with your fists.
1477111 1479904 - I couldn't use my gun. There was a crowd.<br />- Okay, six more days.
1480072 1481864 Look, I don't wanna hear that anymore.
1482032 1485201 Hey, did Rianne get her job back?<br />Did she get a raise? Did she?
1485369 1487161 I don't hear a "thank you. "
1487329 1490790 Maybe I should, uh, become one of those<br />Hollywood agents. What do you think?
1490958 1493418 - Hmm. Won't work.<br />- Why?
1493585 1497839 - You gotta have killer instinct.<br />- Heh. Son of a bitch.
1498048 1501926 - We should've put the bag on the meter.<br />- Put it in the glove compartment.
1502094 1505054 - No, no. I don't do that anymore.<br />- Oh, yeah? Good man.
1505222 1507557 No, it's full up already.<br />Put it in the back seat.
1511645 1514772 - You really like those things, huh?<br />- What, these? Yeah, it's good.
1517568 1520862 Hey, you know, you can eat a box of them.<br />I'm still dying for a cigarette.
1524241 1527368 - What, you cut yourself shaving?<br />- Yeah.
1527536 1531205 - Old razor?<br />- Old face.
1532791 1536544 I think you're really letting this<br />retirement thing get you down, Rog.
1536712 1539881 Why don't you spend a couple<br />more years, think it over. Why quit?
1540049 1542258 - I got plans for my retirement.<br />- Yeah, plans.
1542426 1544218 - I do. Big plans.<br />- Sure. Big plans?
1544386 1546346 - I had them for a long time.<br />- Like what?
1546513 1547930 Like, uh...
1548807 1552560 - Uh, hey, things, man. Okay, yeah, huh?<br />- Things. Things.
1552728 1554771 Yeah, yeah. Things I've put off too long.
1554938 1557857 - Those things. I got those things too.<br />- Yeah, Riggs. Right.
1558025 1561152 I can see you've given this<br />a lot of thought, Rog, actually.
1563113 1564614 Yeah.
1565616 1567825 I've given it a lot of thought, Riggs.
1586804 1588513 Goddamn it!
1588680 1589847 What the hell's going on?
1590015 1591641 I'm pissed off! You need a reason?
1591809 1593059 I thought I heard gunfire.
1593227 1595311 Get your hearing checked. Put that away.
1595938 1599482 - What are you looking at?<br />- Hey, man. Peace.
1620796 1625466 - Riggs, why'd you call us down here?<br />- Everybody, it's all right.
1625634 1628511 - Hey, how you doing, son?<br />- Your mother know you're here?
1632015 1633599 Hey, did you do this?
1633767 1636310 - Nice shooting, phew.<br />- Regular Billy the Kid, huh?
1637688 1639480 Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?
1639648 1642525 Give that to your mom.<br />Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.
1642693 1645278 - Hey, can I borrow your glasses?<br />- Yeah.
1645446 1648322 Okay, who's wearing?<br />Roger, you're wearing. I need you.
1648490 1652535 - Why me? You guys should be wearing.<br />- Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.
1652703 1654871 I've been dressing myself since I was 30.
1655038 1657331 - Okay, man, just trying to help.<br />- Just get back.
1657499 1660042 - All you perverts, turn your heads.<br />- Take it off.
1660210 1661794 Hold this shirt.
1661962 1663045 Woo-hoo.
1663213 1665089 Wearing a girdle, man.
1665257 1667508 - He's got a girdle!<br />- This is not a girdle.
1667676 1670553 This is not a girdle. It's my back.<br />My back went out on me.
1670721 1673764 - He hurt his back.<br />- Hurt my back this morning lifting weights.
1673932 1676476 What you talking about?<br />I hurt my back lifting weights.
1676643 1679228 Yeah, I saw him do it.<br />Okay, everybody, listen up.
1679396 1682273 I want you all to have a look<br />at these lovely bullets.
1682441 1684400 - These are cute.<br />- Notice the smooth jacket.
1684568 1688154 Pay particular attention to the tip.<br />Good close look at it.
1691742 1695203 Now, you've all seen these vests<br />stop a. 357 magnum bullet, haven't you?
1695370 1696996 - Yeah.<br />- So what?
1697164 1698456 Okay.
1699750 1700917 Observe.
1715933 1717808 Son of a bitch.
1719520 1721979 - Armor-piercing bullets? Jesus.<br />- Yeah, cop killers.
1722147 1723648 - Shit.<br />- Serious shit.
1723815 1726901 Those bullets came from the gun<br />of a suspect we arrested yesterday.
1727069 1729612 - Armored-car guy?<br />- Yeah. They're out on the streets.
1729780 1732740 Vests are optional, boys and girls.<br />Especially boys.
1732908 1734951 - Holy fuck.<br />- See you, Riggs.
1735118 1736911 Well, let's just keep our eyes open.
1737079 1738788 Cop killers.
1740791 1742667 Son of a bitch.
1745087 1746963 I, uh, think we should<br />talk to Billy Phelps.
1747130 1749465 I'll have him brought down<br />for interrogation, okay?
1750551 1751884 Yeah.
1757766 1760309 I'm here to talk to a prisoner, sergeant,<br />Billy Phelps.
1760477 1763604 - Can I see all your ID there?<br />- Sure.
1763772 1766983 William Phelps, armored-car suspect.<br />He's been moved to interrogation.
1767150 1769652 - Know where that is?<br />- Sure. Been there a lot.
1769903 1770945 Okay.
1779913 1781163 Same floor.
1781540 1782999 - Hey, Rog.<br />- Hm?
1783166 1784458 I guess now you're retiring...
1784626 1787044 ...that, uh, Swiss bank account<br />is gonna come in pretty handy.
1788422 1790840 How much you got in there, a million?<br />Million and a half?
1791174 1793509 - Five.<br />- Five.
1793677 1795177 Well, you deserve it, man.
1795345 1798681 It's better than those miserable<br />drug dealers getting it.
1802686 1804312 What are you talking about?
1804479 1807773 Hey, don't sweat it. You laundered it,<br />didn't you? They can't trace it.
1808650 1810484 - They can't trace it.<br />- Well, now, heh...
1810652 1813863 Look, so long as I get an invite<br />to the Casa de Murtaugh, I'm happy.
1814031 1815406 Casa what?
1815574 1817783 - I've never been to Portugal.<br />- Stop joking.
1817951 1819702 - She's a cop, man.<br />- I know she's a cop.
1819870 1822371 She's probably on the take too.<br />What do you take me for?
1822539 1824957 Come on. The whole force is bent.
1825125 1828002 Look, she may be wearing a skirt,<br />but we're all brothers.
1828170 1829420 I don't have nothing there.
1829588 1831422 - I ain't been to Portugal.<br />- Beautiful.
1831590 1834383 This Murtaugh... This...
1836970 1839138 Son of a bitch.
1839306 1840348 Hey, how you doing?
1840515 1841974 - Fine.<br />- Who is it today?
1842142 1843434 - Billy...<br />- Billy Phelps.
1844019 1845061 Huh.
1845228 1846854 - Who are you?<br />- Fly me.
1847022 1849065 I'm your friendly Portuguese airline.
1849608 1852360 - She's Infernal Affairs, Rog.<br />- How'd you know?
1852527 1856238 Well, I took the liberty of looking<br />at your file folder. It was showing.
1856406 1858157 Lorna Cole.
1858450 1861160 - And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- I used to be.
1861328 1864246 Yeah, what's Infernal Repairs<br />want with our collar?
1864414 1868125 - We're taking over, thanks.<br />- Nobody told us they were taking over.
1868293 1871504 - Nobody has to tell you anything.<br />- I wanna go and see the captain.
1871672 1873005 You wanna go see the captain?
1873173 1874924 - Let's go see the captain.<br />- All right.
1875092 1877259 - And, uh, put on a vest.<br />- Oh, are you wearing one?
1877427 1881097 - Hey, hey, hey. Just take it easy, man.<br />- Okay.
1892401 1895069 Hey, guys. Phelps, William.<br />Actually, his name's Billy.
1895237 1896946 - Phelps? You too?<br />- Hi.
1897114 1899448 - Popular guy today.<br />- Somebody with him?
1899616 1902618 No, not really.<br />He's down the hall to the right.
1902786 1905371 - Wanna sign in here, sarge?<br />- Sure.
1905539 1907164 - Miss.<br />- Thank you.
1907332 1910793 - What's Internal Affairs doing here?<br />- Don't start. I just found out myself.
1910961 1913212 This is Herman Walters,<br />chief of intelligence.
1913380 1915297 You haven't met his daughter,<br />Lorna Doone.
1915465 1917049 - Cole.<br />- Pleased to meet you.
1917217 1920094 The Phelps case has been<br />transferred to Internal Affairs.
1920262 1922138 - Why? Tell me why.<br />- I can't tell you.
1922305 1923639 - That's classified.<br />- Classi...?
1923807 1926559 - We busted our buns busting this guy.<br />- Busted is right.
1926727 1928227 He spent the night in hospital.
1928395 1930354 - He forgot to buckle.<br />- We cited him for it.
1930522 1932815 - I know. I read your report.<br />- Yeah.
1932983 1935651 You know, our cases have unfortunately<br />crossed paths here.
1935819 1938154 That's all I can say.<br />We'll take over from here.
1938321 1940030 Captain, what's she talking about?
1940198 1943033 - That's classified.<br />- I said, "Captain. " I'm talking to him.
1943702 1944827 I'm telling you...
1944995 1947163 I said, "Captain. "<br />I'm talking to the captain.
1947330 1949165 - That's classified.<br />- I'm talking to him.
1949332 1951959 - Bullshit!<br />- Murtaugh. Hey, hey. Riggs!
1953754 1956922 Look, maybe these guys<br />can contribute something to this case.
1957090 1960551 From their records, the only thing<br />they contribute is mayhem and chaos.
1960719 1962887 I'm Chaos and he's Mayhem.<br />We're a double act.
1963054 1966432 - Are we required reading or something?<br />- As a matter of fact, you are.
1966600 1969643 It's a cross between Police Gazette<br />and Mad magazine.
1969811 1972313 - What's wrong with Mad?<br />- Nothing, I used to read it.
1972481 1975649 - Oh, yeah, you've got some good taste.<br />- When I was 12.
1975817 1978527 - When you... Yeah.<br />- Hey, hey. Riggs, let's go.
1978695 1980696 We busted him, we can talk to him.<br />Let's go.
1980864 1983032 - Captain.<br />- Riggs. Murtaugh.
1983200 1985326 Get your asses back here.
1988413 1990206 You'll be needing these.
1991041 1992875 I'm reinstating both of you.
1993543 1995377 - Don't you just love him?<br />- Yeah.
1996004 1998214 - God.<br />- No. You're Murtaugh and I'm Riggs.
1998965 2000424 You really are a beautiful man.
2000592 2002551 Yeah, right. Just get rid of the blues.
2002719 2005221 - They don't go with the ponytail.<br />- Absolutely not.
2007307 2009558 - Yeah, right.<br />- And get a haircut.
2009726 2013103 - Of course I won't.<br />- You just exceeded your authority, captain.
2013271 2015648 - That's not the way I see it.<br />- The chief will.
2015816 2017858 - Well, take it up with him.<br />- I think I will.
2018026 2019568 We don't want this screwed up.
2019736 2022988 You're gonna have to get him<br />between lunches. Son of a bitch.
2025700 2027243 Hi, Billy.
2029663 2032414 - Jack.<br />- Bye, Billy.
2039631 2041257 See you, Billy.
2047848 2049849 Sergeant, did you get what you need?
2050016 2052601 Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.
2054271 2056355 How long has Phelps been doing this?
2056523 2059316 - Doing what?<br />- His armored-car thing.
2059484 2062611 - I wouldn't know.<br />- I'm not interested in armored cars.
2075876 2077835 I don't think she's telling us everything.
2078003 2079336 Yeah, I think you're right.
2079504 2082298 Boy, these six days is gonna be rough.
2082465 2085009 God, be good to me, please.
2086428 2089054 Shit, son of a bitch knew<br />there was a camera in the wall.
2089222 2091056 Look how he's covering up.
2091224 2093017 - Damn it.<br />- Didn't know there was one...
2093184 2094476 ...in the interrogation room.
2094644 2095978 - There isn't.<br />- Yeah.
2096855 2098272 Installed them six months ago.
2098440 2100274 - Every station.<br />- That's great.
2100442 2102443 Six months, and we don't know about it?
2102611 2104653 This is the police police, captain.
2104821 2108282 "Police police. " Can you say<br />that three times in a row, real fast?
2108450 2110659 - Am I getting to you?<br />- You trying to bait me?
2110827 2113329 - I'm a master of it.<br />- Well, that figures.
2113496 2116332 Hey, heh, baiting master. Great.<br />I'll try that on Trish.
2116499 2119710 Freeze that. Stop it. Jack Travis.
2119878 2123756 - Who?<br />- Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
2124257 2125633 He was one of us.
2125800 2128636 Hell of a brutal cop.<br />Could beat a confession out of anyone.
2128803 2130012 One hell of a dirty cop.
2130180 2133891 Never seen so many suspensions and<br />reprimands and charges of misconduct.
2134059 2136685 Well, he's also as tough as they come.
2137145 2139355 - What happened to him?<br />- I don't know.
2139522 2143025 His partner and him were on a stakeout.<br />He went for coffee, never came back.
2143193 2145861 Looks like he's had<br />one cappuccino too many.
2146029 2147529 We better brief Walters.
2148490 2150532 Excuse me, cute stuff.
2150700 2152993 - That's harassment.<br />- "Cute stuff. " That's you.
2153954 2157623 - Captain.<br />- Boys, boys. Just the captain.
2157791 2161210 Your involvement in this case ended<br />when Billy Phelps hit the floor.
2161378 2164129 Why don't you go back<br />and beat your street?
2164297 2165339 Really good work.
2165507 2167466 - Now's the time to buy.<br />- Leo, Not now.
2167634 2169593 - Hey, Roger, Roger.<br />- Not now, Leo.
2169761 2172554 - No, no. Not now.<br />- We gotta talk, babe, okay?
2172722 2174598 You're in trouble. You got termites.
2174766 2176016 - Termites?<br />- Uh-huh.
2176184 2178268 - Oh, God.<br />- You're infested.
2178436 2180729 The only thing holding up your house<br />is the paint.
2180897 2184066 Rog, I think we should go.<br />Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
2184234 2186819 We should go to Evidence,<br />pull every file on this guy.
2186987 2189279 I know this guy.<br />What are you watching, Geraldo?
2189447 2190698 - What?<br />- I know the guy.
2190865 2193075 - How do you know him?<br />- I've seen the guy before.
2193243 2195577 - Hey, where?<br />- I don't know. I recognize him...
2195745 2198706 His name's Jack Travis, Leo.<br />Does that ring a bell? Jack Travis.
2198873 2201625 Hey, hey, hey.<br />Hands off the clothes. Okay, baby?
2201793 2204503 - Okay, I'm thinking. Let me think. Okay.<br />- Think.
2204671 2206296 - A big party.<br />- Okay.
2206464 2209883 Somebody brought a monkey because<br />the monkey knocked over the salad bar.
2210051 2213095 And this guy comes in,<br />introduced me to another guy...
2213263 2215305 ...who wants a favor.
2215473 2217182 - I got it. I got it. I got it!<br />- What?
2217350 2218183 He got it.
2218476 2220477 - I remember! I remember!<br />- You remember!
2220645 2223605 Hey, don't do it.<br />Don't let the earring fool you.
2223773 2225941 - Hey, we're back. We're back.<br />- Yeah. Yeah.
2226109 2227443 - All right. Listen.<br />- Yeah.
2227610 2229236 Think I could get a gun this time?
2229404 2230863 No!
2240165 2245002 Okay, this is it. See, these guys always<br />wanted me to do favors for them.
2245170 2249048 Like, some guys wanted broads,<br />another guy wanted Cuban cigars.
2249215 2253510 Your guy, hockey.<br />The best seats in the house.
2255472 2258348 - Where's the seats?<br />- Yeah.
2258516 2261268 Uh, probably by the glass.<br />Around the glass.
2261436 2263687 Does "needle in a haystack"<br />mean anything to you?
2263855 2265355 Why don't we spread out?
2265523 2269943 You know, if we all take a different<br />direction, it'd be like old times.
2270111 2273072 Don't push, lady.<br />I'm on police business here.
2273239 2275199 Just take it easy, now.
2287670 2291006 Go! All right!
2302936 2306063 Los Angeles<br />penalty. Number 15, Tony Brown.
2306231 2308190 Two minutes for high-sticking.
2308358 2310651 Time, 5:15.

2336594 2339847 We know you're in here. We know<br />where you are. Just stay in your seat.
2340014 2341890 Don't be stupid.
2342183 2344518 And I'll be there to escort you out<br />in a minute.
2344686 2347813 There's policemen at every exit,<br />so it's no use trying to run.
2347981 2349940 - Stay where you are.<br />- Smart son of a bitch.
2350108 2352568 Thank you for your cooperation.<br />Play on, boys.
2367292 2368500 Come on, let's go!
2378928 2381096 Get out of my fucking way!
2383766 2387811 Ooh! Ooh! Riggs! Riggs! Roger! Roger!
2392192 2394234 Ooh! Excuse me. Excuse me.
2401451 2404161 - Hey!<br />- Riggs!
2407207 2408415 You can't be on the ice.
2413129 2415047 Ooh! Ooh!
2415798 2417549 I got him. I got him.
2419677 2422804 You have the right to remain...<br />You're under arrest.
2432148 2434650 - Fucking weasel.<br />- What the hell's going on here?
2434817 2435817 I'm L.A.P.D. L.A.P.D.
2435985 2438278 I don't care. You can't be on the ice.
2438446 2440906 What is this, a convention?
2445536 2448080 - I got him.<br />- You're all right, pal. Just stay calm.
2452001 2453210 Tell my mother, Rog.
2453378 2456046 - Where did he go?<br />- Down there. Down there.
2466474 2469017 Son of a bitch.
2470853 2472854 He thinks I don't know I'm dying.<br />I know it.
2473022 2476275 - No. You'll be okay.<br />- Yeah, yeah. I'm dying, Roger.
2476442 2479695 - You'll be okay.<br />- I'm choking, see?
2479862 2481822 This is what they do when they die.<br />I saw them.
2481990 2485325 - Leo, it's gonna be okay.<br />- Yeah, well, I'm... I'm numb.
2485493 2487619 My whole body's numb. I can't feel it.
2487787 2490455 - Leo, Leo.<br />- I'm gonna die, I know it. What?
2490873 2492457 You're lying on the ice.
2494377 2497296 - That's why I'm cold?<br />- That's why you're cold.
2497463 2499631 - That's why I'm numb, huh?<br />- That's why you're numb.
2499799 2501508 He shot me. Look at all the blood.
2501676 2504594 - It's just a flesh wound.<br />- So it's okay.
2504762 2507055 - Let's get you up. One, two, three.<br />- Yeah.
2507223 2509474 There you go. You're gonna make it.
2509642 2512602 He's okay, he's okay.<br />He's gonna make it. He's alive.
2512770 2514521 Ooh! Ow, ow!
2518985 2522571 - Bring him this way, guys.<br />- I can't believe this. I just...
2522739 2524990 - I can't believe I got shot.<br />- You'll be all right.
2525158 2526450 - Riggs, you here?<br />- Calm down.
2526617 2529745 We're all the same now.<br />We all got shot.
2529912 2531872 - You'll be fine.<br />- Ouch. That's...
2532040 2535167 - Relax, Mr. Getz.<br />- I'm fine. Nothing wrong with me.
2535335 2536710 I can take this. Ouch!
2536878 2540088 - We're gonna take care of it.<br />- You'll be out of here. No big deal.
2540256 2542507 I don't think that's a good idea.<br />You shouldn't rush this.
2542675 2544343 - Yeah.<br />- You should rest up, Leo.
2544510 2545927 A dumdum wound can be serious.
2546596 2548180 What's a dumdum wound?
2548723 2552726 You don't know? A guy got his thumb<br />shot off by a dumdum.
2552894 2554936 From the shock,<br />he was dead two days later.
2555104 2556730 Dead two days later?
2556898 2558231 He died from dumdums?
2558399 2560817 - We'll keep you overnight.<br />- Yeah, take it slow.
2560985 2563278 Two days? All right,<br />we'll keep him two days.
2563446 2565781 - You'll be here two days.<br />- That Leo's chart?
2565948 2568700 - Two days, you'll be good as new.<br />- I should be with them.
2568868 2571244 - Bye, Leo.<br />- I should be with... Hey! Ow! Ouch!
2571913 2575290 - How do you spell, "proctological"?<br />- Rectal exam?
2575666 2578627 - No, you can't do that to Leo.<br />- Sure we can.
2578795 2581338 - Why's she taking...?<br />- Please, Mr. Getz. You'll get...
2581506 2584549 You've been shot in the arm.<br />Let her take it. You'll get it back.
2584717 2586468 - Okay.<br />- There's a clock in your room.
2586636 2588637 - Okay, fine. Riggs.<br />- Yeah?
2588805 2590222 This look like a dumdum wound?
2590973 2593350 - It sounded like one when it happened.<br />- Shit.
2593518 2596269 - Take it easy. Two days.<br />- Two days and you'll be out.
2596437 2597479 - All right.<br />- Okay?
2597647 2600315 - Hey, I'll see you guys.<br />- We won't make a move without you.
2600483 2602567 I thought that bullet sounded different.
2602735 2605153 - Relax. They'll be there when you get out.<br />- I'm fine.
2605321 2607614 - You own your own house, doc?<br />- What?
2607782 2609699 - You don't recognize my face?<br />- No, sir.
2609867 2611159 Watch.
2611869 2615288 About time. These doggy treats<br />are okay, but I need some human food.
2615456 2616498 Don't worry.
2616666 2620127 I'm about to make you one of the best<br />things you ever had in your life.
2620503 2624923 - Hey, you ever eat one of my hamburgers?<br />- I've been lucky so far. I'll take a chance.
2625091 2627968 Yeah. Hey, Fast Eddie.
2628136 2630011 - How's business?<br />- Booming. Can't you tell?
2630179 2631221 I'm looking at it.
2631389 2632764 - You meet my partner?<br />- No.
2632932 2635767 I wanna cook one<br />of those monster burgers for him.
2635935 2637185 - Go for it.<br />- All right.
2637353 2639354 - Gonna let him cook?<br />- Do I have a choice?
2639522 2642983 - No, because it's Wednesday.<br />- Too big to argue with.
2643568 2645652 In that case, give me a McRog.
2645820 2647737 - Hold the hair.<br />- Heh, heh.
2647905 2648947 You wash your hands?
2649115 2652742 Keep joking, but I guarantee<br />you're gonna like this burger.
2652910 2656705 And you're gonna come back<br />with your friends.
2656873 2660500 I haven't got any friends,<br />you know that, Rog. Well, except you.
2660668 2662377 He's a comedian in his spare time.
2662545 2665213 Oh, yeah?<br />When is he gonna say something funny?
2665381 2669009 Hey, uh, you gonna put that out?<br />You're finished with it, yeah?
2669177 2670886 Do you mind, huh? Thanks.
2673222 2675056 Sorry. I was just looking at it.
2675475 2677142 - Chew on this onion.<br />- Yeah.
2677310 2680187 - Yeah. He's quitting, so help him, okay?<br />- I quit.
2680897 2682898 I was only looking at it.
2684859 2687569 Ah. First thing is the fat.
2687737 2690238 Everybody says, "Cut the fat. "
2690406 2693074 My uncle said,<br />"You cut the fat, you kill the burger. "
2693242 2694993 - Yep.<br />- There's an art to this.
2695161 2697204 You just can't plop this on the grill.
2700249 2703043 Gently coax the flavors out.
2704670 2706254 - Yo, hey.<br />- What's the problem?
2713554 2716932 A little pepper,<br />then you massage it a little bit.
2717099 2720727 Just a little bit. Sweet, sweet meat.
2723773 2725398 Shit, man, feel it.
2729195 2732072 Okay, guys. L.A.P.D.<br />Let me see your hands.
2732532 2734741 Come on, let me see your hands.<br />Get them up!
2734909 2738370 In the car. Get them up there.<br />Let me see both of them. Come on!
2743000 2744626 Hey, Riggs.
2752552 2753927 Riggs!
2754554 2757055 God, don't you love me? Five days.
2764814 2766648 Don't do that shit to me.
2766816 2768233 - Riggs, you okay?<br />- Yeah.
2768401 2770443 Come on. Who did it?
2772655 2775615 All right, asshole.<br />I wanna see your hands right now.
2802518 2803977 Back me up, Riggs!
2829754 2831504 Darryl?
2837178 2839554 Oh, fuck, no. Darryl!
2842850 2846519 Call an ambulance.<br />Riggs, call an ambulance. Breathe.
2847063 2850315 Breathe.
2850483 2852734 Call an ambulance, Riggs.
2853569 2855654 Hey, come on. Breathe. Oh, God.
2855821 2857489 Fuck, it's Darryl.
2858199 2859574 Darryl, breathe.
2859742 2861409 God, don't do this to me. Breathe.
2861577 2863244 - He's dead, Rog.<br />- Fucking breathe!
2863412 2866665 - Breathe! God, don't do this.<br />- He's dead, Rog.
2866832 2869209 He's dead, Rog. Rog, he's dead.
2869377 2871503 He's dead, Rog.<br />Don't mess with it, man.
2871671 2875256 He's dead. Come on, man,<br />it was a clean shoot.
2875424 2877300 It's okay, it was a clean shoot.
2877468 2879469 He was gonna do you,<br />he was gonna do me.
2880096 2881262 It's okay. You okay?
2882223 2883932 It's not okay.
2884266 2886935 - What?<br />- I know that kid.
2889271 2890563 I know that kid.
2892108 2894109 He's Nick's friend.
2911794 2913753 - Got it, Mom.<br />- I'll get it.
2913921 2917132 Hello? Hi, Martin.
2917550 2919050 He's not here.
2926350 2928435 Oh, my God.
2931021 2932647 Thanks.
2961594 2963511 Fuck. Fuck.
2969393 2971186 How you doing? Taking your vitamins?
2971353 2973480 - Riggs, how's Murtaugh?<br />- He's good. He's fine.
2973647 2975023 Morning, captain.
2975191 2978193 - I'm sure he's anything but fine.<br />- Really, he's okay.
2978360 2981404 - I'd really like to talk to him.<br />- I don't think that's a good idea.
2981572 2984157 I think the best thing you could do<br />is leave him alone.
2984325 2987869 - Let's, uh, get something for your cold.<br />- I know what I'm talking about, Riggs.
2988871 2992165 - You and I have to talk.<br />- Talking to you is bad for my image.
2992333 2994167 - I'm afraid I insist.<br />- Oh, you insist?
2994335 2996586 Well, in that case,<br />let's find somewhere private.
2996754 2998880 Here, step into my orifice.
3001592 3003218 Here.
3004637 3006137 Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?
3006305 3007555 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Yeah.
3007723 3011351 - Clip any wrong wires lately?<br />- No, I haven't done that for a couple days.
3011519 3013770 - Next time, wait for the bomb squad.<br />- Bomb squad.
3013938 3015021 Yeah, it's our job.
3015189 3017982 Okay, I'll remember that. We saved a cat.<br />What do you want?
3018150 3020860 - Great. I love cats.<br />- Hey.
3021987 3023613 Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.
3023781 3027575 You purposefully withheld information<br />concerning a case under my investigation.
3027743 3031120 - Yeah, damn right I did.<br />- Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
3031288 3034040 You had a tip on Travis,<br />you should have shared it with me.
3034208 3035834 No, I take that back.
3036001 3038586 You were required to share it with me.
3038754 3041130 - I was required to share it with you?<br />- Yeah.
3041298 3043258 I don't have to share shit with you.
3043425 3046678 If you don't scratch<br />my back, I don't throw you...
3046846 3049597 - Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that.<br />- Yes, you can.
3049765 3052684 Why don't you cut out<br />this classified bullshit?
3052852 3055019 Right now. It's giving me the shits!
3055187 3057939 We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.<br />We're on the same side.
3058107 3059274 - Right? Right?<br />- Right!
3059441 3062527 Right? Good.<br />Why don't we start to act like it, huh?
3062695 3064612 Come on, there's kids out there. Babies.
3064780 3066781 No brains,<br />but they got automatic weapons.
3066949 3070076 - Yesterday, my partner, he nailed this kid...<br />- I know about Murtaugh.
3071996 3074956 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riggs.
3075916 3077500 Yeah.
3080421 3081796 Look, uh...
3082256 3084757 Look, why don't you let me in on this?<br />I can help you.
3084925 3088136 I really wanna help you, if you'll let me.<br />Let me.
3088304 3090388 Come on, what do you say?<br />We got a deal?
3094310 3095643 Wash your hands, Riggs.
3098230 3101107 And, um, meet me in my office.
3101442 3104944 Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll be right there.
3106780 3107822 Be right there.
3108699 3110450 MAC-10, 9 mm, semi-automatic...
3110618 3113745 - ... converted to automatic...<br />- With 36 rounds in the magazine.
3113913 3117582 On a sesame-seed bun. Very illegal.
3117750 3120668 - That gun has a history. Wanna know it?<br />- Tell me.
3124173 3126799 Killed a convenience-store clerk<br />in L.A. County, July 1990.
3126967 3131387 Was used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990.
3131555 3136517 Confiscated by a truant officer<br />of the L.A. School Board, October 1990.
3136685 3139312 Scheduled for destruction by the L.A.P.D.<br />six weeks ago.
3139480 3141940 - Scheduled for destruction?<br />- Yeah.
3142107 3144108 But it never got there.
3146153 3149113 Instead, it found its way into the hands<br />of a 15-year-old boy...
3149281 3151532 ...who fired on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3151700 3155036 - Thought it looked familiar.<br />- That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3155204 3158831 ...were stolen from a police storage<br />facility before they could be destroyed.
3158999 3162001 They should be paper clips right now<br />or license plates.
3162169 3165713 Anything but a gun. Here we are,<br />busting our asses on the streets...
3165881 3170093 ...to get these weapons out of circulation<br />and now they're headed right back out.
3170260 3172804 When you busted Phelps,<br />you stumbled onto something...
3172972 3175056 ...the department's<br />trying to keep a lid on.
3175224 3178601 That's why Internal Affairs is on this.<br />They think it's an inside job.
3178769 3181354 Yeah, that's right.<br />They knew police procedures.
3181522 3183773 They knew where the guns were<br />and how to get in.
3183941 3186234 They knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3186402 3189195 ...because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3189363 3192073 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />- Or an ex-cop.
3192366 3194409 - Right. Travis.<br />- Travis.
3197079 3199163 And you let him slip<br />through your fingers.
3200416 3203876 - That's closer than you ever got.<br />- Close, Riggs?
3204044 3207088 Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window.
3209800 3213219 - You wanna go for a ride?<br />- Sure, where we going?
3213595 3215179 Surprise.
3219852 3221936 Oh, I love surprises.
3222187 3223563 What is this place?
3223731 3226232 I accessed Billy Phelps'<br />phone records on my computer.
3226400 3228192 He made a dozen calls to this address.
3228360 3230528 - Yeah?<br />- Nice of you to steal that information.
3230696 3231738 Semantics, Riggs.
3231905 3234949 Semantics? I'm always up for some antics.
3235659 3240455 - All right, let's go on three. One...<br />- Uh, on three, or three and then go?
3240622 3242331 - What?<br />- Never mind. One, two, three.
3245711 3247128 Gotcha.
3260976 3263061 Looks like Billy's grandmother<br />owns a big dog.
3263228 3264812 That isn't a dog. That's a horse.
3265481 3267440 I hate dogs, Riggs.
3268067 3270276 - I don't get it.<br />- You don't get what?
3270444 3272403 That's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
3272571 3277617 No, I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window. " I don't get that.
3277785 3279660 Riggs, later.
3283957 3286667 - What are you doing?<br />- Well, I can't shoot a dog.
3286835 3288503 People, okay, but not dogs.
3288670 3291130 I think I should try<br />and make friends with him.
3291298 3293633 - Make friends?<br />- Yeah.
3293801 3297512 Now, don't run, because he'll only<br />chase you down and kill you.
3297679 3299263 Uh-huh.
3299973 3302892 Here, boy. Here, boy.
3310317 3313027 - Here. Good boy. Yes.<br />- Shit.
3320369 3321619 Riggs.
3327000 3328292 You're crazy.
3348397 3351357 Want one? Want one?<br />You hungry? Huh?
3353068 3354569 You're a hungry boy.
3354736 3357071 Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
3357489 3359490 What a good fella.
3359658 3361951 Here. Here's more. Leave some for me.
3362119 3366080 Very slowly, as if you're not here,<br />just walk away.
3366248 3369333 - You want me to go?<br />- Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
3369501 3372295 - Guy sort of thing?<br />- Are you all alone in here?
3381597 3382763 Stay, stay.
3384892 3386601 Come on, let's go.
3397571 3399447 - Let's go. Let's go.<br />- Watch.
3399615 3400948 On two.
3407789 3409665 - All right, how many is that?<br />- Fifty-five.
3409833 3413127 Fifty-five. All right, we got eight more.
3413295 3415504 All right, we'll get these later. Let's go.
3419134 3422470 Hi, fellas. What's in all these boxes?
3433398 3437568 Easy, let's not kill him yet.<br />Let's see who he is first, all right?
3439947 3441489 You have the right to remain silent.
3441657 3443407 Shut him up.
3443575 3445785 Sergeant Martin Riggs, heh.
3447829 3449914 - Hubie, get the truck ready.<br />- Right.
3450082 3451582 So, Sergeant Riggs...
3451750 3453334 ...how did you find us?
3453502 3454794 Freeze. Police!
3456463 3457672 Oh, another one?
3458090 3459674 We need a new fucking dog.
3459841 3461676 Get your hands up, asshole.
3461843 3463678 Get them up.
3466974 3469183 A little bit higher. That's better.
3470686 3472311 Very good.
3476275 3478109 Drop it, miss.
3479778 3481028 Now, look...
3529077 3531537 Okay, I'm on. No, I'm not. I'm off! Wait!
3531705 3534373 Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
3537836 3541213 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Get down! Get down!
3544760 3546344 Get those cases and kill that dog.
3558565 3560941 Stop! The dog. Wait for the dog.
3561109 3564028 - Where'd you learn to fight?<br />- Catholic school. Forget the dog.
3564196 3567615 Here, boy. Come on. We're waiting<br />for the dog. Just hold it, hold it.
3567783 3571118 Hurry. Come on, dog.<br />Good dog. Good puppy. Go! Go!
3573622 3574789 Stop!
3574956 3576791 - What? What?<br />- Guns.
3576958 3578084 - Full of guns.<br />- Grab one.
3578251 3579960 - You grab one.<br />- You got friends?
3580128 3581587 Step on it!
3585300 3587301 Get that crate. Come on.
3593141 3595476 Hatchett, you said<br />not to worry about the police...
3595644 3597520 ...but the cops are all over you, man.
3597687 3600064 They got my guns.<br />They'll be coming after me next.
3600232 3602400 Far as I'm concerned, the deal's off.
3602567 3605736 Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone, all right?<br />We have a deal.
3605904 3607321 Nobody backs out.
3607489 3609490 You said you had the cops under control.
3609658 3613327 I see that isn't so. Give me one reason<br />why I should do business with you.
3613495 3617415 - I'll give you a real good reason.<br />- Hey, Tyrone, this is Travis.
3617582 3621710 You back out now, and I'll make certain<br />that only your dentist can identify the body.
3621878 3624171 Is that a good enough reason for you?
3626591 3628300 But I need ammo.
3628468 3630386 I'm out of business without ammo.
3630554 3634640 - I need the good stuff.<br />- You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3635851 3637560 "The good stuff. " Jesus. Pfft!
3637727 3639854 Time to pay another visit to the L.A.P.D.
3642023 3643732 You look like I feel.
3654035 3657079 Hey. Hey.
3657247 3659457 You got anything I can put on my head?
3659624 3661000 There's a hat in the closet.
3661168 3665754 You're all heart. Here I thought you were<br />gonna get all tender and maternal with me.
3665922 3668340 Listen, Riggs,<br />I was raised with four brothers.
3668508 3669758 We got hurt all the time...
3669926 3673179 ...but if no bones were broken<br />or blood wasn't gushing, nobody cared.
3673346 3675723 - Hey, look, blood. See? Blood.<br />- It's not gushing.
3675891 3678559 Well, it was free-flowing earlier.
3678935 3680895 Could you bring me<br />a needle and thread?
3681062 3684523 You know, maybe some peroxide.<br />I can patch it up myself.
3686568 3689487 - Don't touch anything.<br />- I wasn't. I didn't...
3691239 3692948 What's with you, anyway?
3708256 3711300 - The boys.<br />- Hey, what are you doing, huh?
3711468 3714094 - I told you not to touch anything.<br />- Uh, this came on by itself.
3714262 3716514 - Came on all by itself? You a wise guy?<br />- I swear.
3716681 3718599 You don't like to share your toys?
3718767 3720518 - This isn't a toy, Riggs.<br />- What is it?
3720685 3722436 - This is a weapon. Yeah.<br />- A weapon?
3722604 3724605 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3724773 3727066 What, do you throw it at people?<br />Pretty heavy.
3727234 3729944 You're gonna give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3730111 3731111 Right here.
3731279 3733447 - Okay, take a little off the top.<br />- Right here.
3739621 3741956 - You bring all your interrogations home?<br />- Okay.
3742123 3744583 - What are we talking about?<br />- Well, it's back here.
3744751 3746126 Careful. Careful.
3746294 3747795 - Careful. Oh.<br />- This?
3747963 3750464 - This scratch?<br />- Come on, it feels like Grand Canyon.
3750632 3752424 - Oh, God.<br />- Ah!
3752592 3754051 - Hold still.<br />- Yeah.
3754219 3758180 - Ah!<br />- Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3758348 3759598 Be gentle with me.
3760350 3762977 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3763144 3767022 Huh? Oh, that's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3767274 3769817 - That's a natural mistake.<br />- What, I have a wooden head?
3769985 3771277 - Look at that.<br />- It's a knife.
3771444 3773571 - Knife? That's very knife.<br />- Mm-hm.
3773863 3774905 This is all right.
3775073 3777491 Oh, that's pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw. Mm-hm.
3777659 3780661 Hey, that's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this, huh?
3780829 3782830 Same damn thing. Third and Highland.
3782998 3785916 - Dragged for about half a block.<br />- That's a good one.
3786084 3788252 Feel that texture. Feel it.<br />Cheese-grater time.
3788420 3790504 - Moving truck.<br />- Moving truck? Ooh!
3790672 3792089 - Moving bullet.<br />- Moving bullet?
3792257 3794008 - Here. This is the best.<br />- Bullets now.
3794759 3797595 - It goes all the way to the back.<br />- Oh, hey. Right through?
3797762 3799346 You're lucky. What is it,.22?
3799514 3801015 - It's a. 38, Riggs.<br />- That's a. 38?
3801182 3804018 - It's a. 38.<br />- That's a wimpy. 38. This is a. 38.
3804185 3807104 - Yours is bigger than mine? Don't think so.<br />- I think so.
3807272 3808522 Maybe not, but look. Watch.
3808690 3811859 A whole family of. 44s on the back.
3812027 3814111 - Look, there they are.<br />- Impressive.
3814279 3817656 One got stuck in my lung.<br />I was breathing blood bubbles. Disgusting.
3817824 3819116 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3819284 3821160 - You got one?<br />- Mm.
3821328 3822953 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3823246 3824705 - Oh, yeah.<br />- Mm-hm.
3825248 3827958 - Yeah. Right down here. Went through.<br />- Oh.
3828126 3829335 - That must've hurt.<br />- Right.
3829502 3830544 - Not too close.<br />- Pfft!
3830712 3832630 Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
3832797 3835549 I can beat it. I can beat it.<br />Have a look at this.
3835717 3837968 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- You gotta see this.
3838136 3840888 - I'll take your word.<br />- This guy had a knife. You'll love it.
3841056 3843682 He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3844100 3846727 - Hurt like a son of a bitch.<br />- I'll take your word for it.
3846895 3848020 No, I said forget it.
3848188 3851106 - This is a blue-ribbon event.<br />- Forget it, Riggs.
3852192 3853233 Hey, you started this.
3853401 3856070 - Yeah, well, I can end it.<br />- You know what?
3856529 3857905 You're a very poor loser.
3859366 3860574 I didn't lose, Riggs.
3860742 3862493 - Yes, you did.<br />- No. No, I didn't lose.
3862661 3864244 - You lost.<br />- I conceded.
3864412 3866830 There's a difference between<br />losing and conceding.
3866998 3868666 You conceded or you're conceited?
3868833 3870918 - You think I'm conceited?<br />- Oh, yeah.
3871086 3873253 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3873421 3874463 I'll get a Band-Aid.
3874631 3877758 - Tell me you lost.<br />- I said, don't touch anything.
3889479 3892022 You're gonna smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
3892899 3894817 I can do better than that, Riggs.
3911918 3915295 This could be<br />a serious ethical breach here.
3915588 3917756 I never made it<br />with another sergeant before.
3917924 3919591 Shut up, Riggs.
3974522 3976023 Oh!
3977901 3980527 Oh, damn, Riggs.
3982322 3985741 - What do you want, Riggs?<br />- Just wanted to see how you were doing.
3985909 3987284 Who sent you? Trish?
3987452 3990078 Well, uh, you're doing pretty well.<br />Trish didn't send me.
3990246 3992790 Rianne came to see me.<br />She asked me to find you.
3992957 3995542 - Your place?<br />- Well, that's where I am.
3995710 3999880 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Yeah.
4000048 4002508 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- What the hell?
4002675 4004301 Come on, Roger, she was worried.
4004469 4006386 Get off of my boat, Riggs.
4006554 4008388 - Oh, come on.<br />- Get off my boat.
4008556 4009890 Look, you're drunk, Rog.
4010058 4012226 That's something<br />you should know about, huh?
4012393 4014478 - This isn't gonna do any good.<br />- Give me that.
4014646 4016063 - No.<br />- Give me that.
4016231 4018065 Rog, please don't do this, okay?
4018233 4021568 You got three days until you retire.<br />This is not gonna do you any good.
4021736 4024112 - You self-righteous bastard. Give it.<br />- Roger!
4024280 4027991 - Look, don't do this, okay? Please.<br />- Give it to me, damn it, Riggs!
4028159 4031703 No! Oh, Jesus Christ.<br />What are you gonna do now, shoot me?
4031871 4033497 - Uh-huh.<br />- There.
4033665 4036250 Take your finger out of my bottle<br />and give me that gun.
4036417 4037584 The bottle's going south.
4039128 4040712 Son of a bitch.
4042590 4044424 Oh, shit.
4045385 4048053 - Not bad for an old man.<br />- You finished?
4048221 4050639 I got another bottle in the galley.<br />I'm gonna get it.
4050807 4054142 No, you're not.<br />Rog, don't do this to yourself, all right?
4054310 4056728 You gotta cut this out.
4057397 4059773 Oh, man, I'm sorry.<br />Are you okay? Are you okay?
4059941 4062317 All right. Sit down. Sit down. You okay?
4063695 4065445 - You hit me.<br />- Cool it, will you?
4065613 4067364 Cut it out. Just give it up, okay?
4067532 4068615 Go ahead.
4068783 4070784 Go ahead. Hit me again.
4070952 4073287 I don't wanna hit you.<br />You think I like this shit?
4073454 4076206 Hit me again, huh?<br />You think I'm afraid of you?
4076374 4078876 - I know you're not. Rog, no!<br />- Of that kung fu shit?
4079043 4080502 Please, Rog.
4081337 4083338 Look, that kid was a killer, all right.
4083506 4084923 That wasn't a toy in his hand.
4085091 4088385 That was a machine pistol<br />with twin carbines and all the trimmings.
4088553 4092097 He would have drilled you, me,<br />anybody that came along, all right?
4092265 4093807 You had no choice.
4094142 4096393 It didn't happen to you.<br />It happened to me.
4096561 4097936 It happened to me!
4098104 4100063 My God, I killed that kid.
4100231 4101773 I killed that boy.
4101941 4103817 Oh, yeah. You kill a lot of people.
4103985 4107654 You kill a fucking lot of people!<br />You ever kill a baby?
4107822 4110991 You got ice in your veins.<br />You ever kill a boy like Nick?
4111159 4114494 You selfish bastard! You selfish bastard!
4114662 4116955 You're just thinking about yourself!<br />Goddamn it.

4122462 4124087 What happens to you, happens to me.
4124255 4127341 After all the shit we've been through,<br />don't you get it?
4127634 4128967 Don't you get it?
4129886 4133138 When you retire, you're not just<br />retiring you, you're retiring us.
4133306 4135557 - You're retiring us.<br />- No. That's not my problem.
4135725 4137351 - Yes, it is.<br />- It's not my problem.
4137518 4139353 You're the only family I've got.

4167298 4170384 I had three days, and now this.
4171010 4172552 I'm sorry.
4172720 4174888 - That's all right.<br />- No, no, I'm sorry.
4176557 4177975 I didn't realize...
4178142 4180227 ...that my retirement's<br />gonna screw you up.
4180395 4184606 Forget it. I haven't got any problems.<br />I was out of line saying that shit.

4543841 4547719 - And you're pulling on the wrong string.<br />- That's not a very professional attitude.
4547887 4550138 - Who the fuck are you guys?<br />- Sorry. L.A.P.D.

4695451 4696910 Hey, Murphy.
4697077 4700580 - People cross the street when they see me.<br />- I didn't have enough time.
4700748 4704125 I'm not your enemy, captain.<br />I'm just trying to do my job.
4704627 4707587 - Have you eaten?<br />- I already ate. I gotta go downtown.
4707755 4709839 - What, do you eat alone?<br />- I'm used to it.
4710007 4711257 It's bad for the digestion.
4711425 4714135 Tomorrow you have lunch with me,<br />but I'm not paying.

4750923 4754801 You wanna try something? Watch this.<br />This is called a backspin kick.
4754969 4756636 Pivot right, kick with your left...
4756804 4759931 ...and you whip that head around<br />to catch the target over there.
4760099 4761975 Get that head round and follow through.
4762142 4765144 Like so. So you whip the head.
4766605 4768147 All right?
4768315 4770483 Thank you. Thank you. Now you try it.

4803892 4807186 Man. Oh, Rog, man, I'm sorry.
4808689 4810481 Sergeant Murtaugh.
4810649 4815653 You could be experiencing some<br />transitional anger caused by the shooting.
4815821 4818072 You wanna talk about it?
4818741 4821159 - I think he's okay for a change, doc.<br />- Are you sure?
4821327 4824954 Yeah. You know, you really look good<br />in red. That's your color, I think.
4825331 4829167 - I've got a little extra time now, sergeant.<br />- I'm fine, doctor.
4834214 4835214 Oh, shit.

4844266 4846351 - Aah!<br />- Hi, skinny.
4846518 4848728 - Delores. You remember me?<br />- I remember you.
4848896 4852065 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
4852232 4856069 As a matter of fact, he's cowering down<br />on all fours right behind this counter.
4858656 4861824 - Listen, where's the sergeant?<br />- He's not here at the moment, Delores.
4861992 4864410 But, uh, he's talked of nothing<br />but you all week.
4864578 4866412 - Shut my mouth.<br />- The man's on fire.
4866580 4868623 - What's the matter, baby?<br />- A little sciatica.
4868791 4872001 Oh. You tell him Delores was here.
4872169 4874045 You tell that man...
4874213 4876255 ...that he's the jam in my jelly roll.
4877633 4881010 - I'll see you, baby, okay? Bye-bye.<br />- Okay. Bye.
4883263 4886140 Delores says that you're<br />the jam in her jelly roll. That's...
4886308 4888142 - I heard.<br />- Heh.
4888310 4890228 - That's a lot of woman there.<br />- Shit.
4890396 4894107 She calls me all the time. And she leaves<br />me notes. What am I gonna do?
4894274 4897777 - You shouldn't have led her on.<br />- Led her on? I didn't do anything, Riggs.
4897945 4901948 I mean, if Trish finds out about it...<br />I didn't... I didn't...
4902282 4904951 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4905119 4907745 You've gotta come see me.
4907913 4910164 Well, we gotta work. Come on. Let's go.
4910332 4913251 - Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />- Yeah. Thanks, doc.
4913502 4914752 - You're a beauty.<br />- Coming?
4914920 4916796 A beauty. Yeah, I'm coming.
4924388 4926305 Afternoon, captain.
4927975 4931102 - That's good, Murphy.<br />- See how easy that was?
4935107 4936858 I love it down here, don't you, Murph?
4937025 4941279 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4944992 4946826 Give me the lock-up keys.
4947369 4950163 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
4950330 4952331 And all busted by<br />the same police officer...
4952499 4954584 ...Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
4954752 4956502 Early paroles<br />on the work furlough program.
4956670 4960173 Uh-huh. Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4960340 4963092 Just a minute. You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4963260 4964510 - What?<br />- May I see your pass?
4964678 4966471 - Wanna see? Here's my pass.<br />- I do.
4966638 4969223 - I got shot in the line of duty, okay?<br />- He's with us.
4969391 4970933 - He's with us?<br />- Did I say that?
4971101 4974353 - Where'd you get her from?<br />- What are you doing out of the hospital?
4974521 4977023 Don't mention the hospital.<br />I told you not to leave me.
4977191 4979776 They tried to take my appendix.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4979943 4981903 - Brain surgery?<br />- No, a lapotomy.
4982070 4984363 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4984531 4985573 What's the difference?
4985741 4989827 The difference is, when you get a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4989995 4993164 - Nether what?<br />- Your nether... I can't say it in front of her.
4993332 4994791 Well, point to it.
4996251 4997543 - Okay. Here.<br />- Must be itchy.
4997711 5000129 Yes, it is itchy.<br />These doctors are savages.
5000297 5003382 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
5003550 5005051 Huh? Huh?
5006428 5008888 Yeah. With a telescope<br />big enough to see Venus.
5009056 5010723 I guess all they saw was Uranus, huh?
5010891 5013059 Oh, that's great. Huh-huh.<br />That's great. Thank you.
5013227 5014644 - You know what I say?<br />- What?
5014812 5018564 They fuck you in the hospital!<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you.
5018732 5019941 And when they're done...
5020108 5023194 ...along comes the insurance company,<br />and fucks you some more.
5023362 5026405 Ten dollars for a fucking aspirin,<br />that's not even covered.
5026573 5027865 - Leo!<br />- That's enough.
5028033 5029575 - We're trying to work here.<br />- Okay.
5029743 5032578 What's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5032746 5034330 You take an ad out in the paper?
5034498 5037083 - He's family. We gotta go somewhere else.<br />- Who's she?
5037251 5039377 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Hey, how are you? Leo Getz.
5039545 5041254 Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?
5041421 5043381 - I get it.<br />- Real estate right now but...
5043549 5045883 Hey, listen. Come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
5046051 5048219 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
5048387 5049971 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5050138 5053432 That's great. I take one for you,<br />and that's what you tell me?
5053600 5056936 - He could check this out.<br />- That's all I'm good for? Takes slugs...
5057104 5059730 Leo, Leo, Leo. Look.<br />We got something for you to do.
5059898 5063401 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
5063569 5066279 - Okay. Sure, I can do this.<br />- Remember that name?
5066446 5068281 Right around... Mesa Verde, I got it.
5068448 5070783 What are you doing giving him<br />Mesa Verde?
5070951 5072785 If there's shit there, he'll dig it up.
5072953 5074829 - Who is that guy?<br />- It's a long story.
5081128 5082545 Here are your keys, captain.
5083964 5085673 - You motherfucker.<br />- Don't be stupid.
5085841 5088426 - The fuck?<br />- Take the elevator, bring the other guys.
5088594 5090386 Keys. Give me your fucking hands.
5091388 5094932 Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.
5095601 5097685 Stand there.
5101106 5103608 I can get faster results<br />than that real-estate broker.
5103775 5106527 Leo's not just a real-estate broker.
5106695 5109572 Yeah, he's a royal pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5110616 5114201 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator, guys.
5114369 5116704 - How'd you know where to find them?<br />- We got it all.
5116872 5118998 World of computers, Murph.<br />World of computers.
5119166 5121834 You used to be one of us,<br />for chrissakes, Jack.
5122002 5125087 You know what future<br />a cop has, Murph? None.
5125255 5128341 Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
5128592 5129884 Pension.
5130385 5131427 Nothing to do.
5131595 5135014 Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain<br />by evening. Well, not for this kid.
5135182 5137308 Police department's got it all:
5137476 5140645 Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.<br />It's a one-stop shopping center.
5140812 5144190 If you got the brains, there's not<br />a thing anybody can do about it.
5144358 5147026 You're already fucking history<br />and you know it.
5147194 5149528 Sorry, Murph.<br />But I'm just getting started.
5150030 5152031 - Something's wrong here.<br />- What?
5152199 5154659 The program's been accessed<br />by somebody from the outside.
5154826 5156327 What? What's been accessed?
5156495 5160081 After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs<br />moved the confiscated ammunition.
5160248 5162458 - Armor-piercing bullets?<br />- Thousands of rounds...
5162626 5165211 ...to a more secured location. Shit.
5165379 5167254 - That's been accessed.<br />- Somebody knows.
5167422 5169632 Where's it stored?<br />Where did they move it?
5170968 5172468 - Wait, wait.<br />- Let's go.
5172636 5176097 - I guess I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.<br />- Where is it?
5176264 5177556 - In the building.<br />- Where?
5177724 5179475 - I'm showing you.<br />- Something going down?
5179643 5181602 - Nothing's going down.<br />- I'm going with you.
5181770 5183562 - Uh, how old are you?<br />- Twenty-two today.
5183730 5187066 Twenty-two? Come on.<br />You got protection?
5187234 5189986 - Right here in my wallet.<br />- No, your vest, you dummy.
5190153 5191237 Should we take him?
5191405 5193948 Okay, but keep your head down.<br />Keep your head down.
5194116 5195533 - Stay behind me.<br />- Come on, let's go.
5195701 5196909 - Yahoo!<br />- Shh! Quiet.
5209256 5210881 See, you were my ticket in, Murph.
5211466 5214093 It's too bad<br />you won't be coming with me.
5218223 5219473 Travis.
5219641 5221475 - They got it all.<br />- Shit.
5222185 5224145 - He's dead.<br />- How'd they get it out of here?
5224312 5226772 - I don't know.<br />- They didn't take it upstairs.
5226940 5228899 Hey, hey. Elevator.
5231486 5234113 - Shit. It's down.<br />- Hey, the subway's down there.
5234281 5236198 - We take the stairs.<br />- L.A. has subways?
5236366 5237408 Where you been, kid?
5237576 5239452 Read something besides the funny pages.
5240495 5242955 All right, guys. Come on, let's hustle.
5245500 5247293 Hurry up, guys.
5259973 5261390 L.A.P.D., guys. Come here.
5261558 5263434 Come here. Step on it.
5264061 5265728 Son of a bitch.
5265896 5267688 You see anybody, anything strange?
5267856 5272401 - Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.<br />- Split now. Just get out of here.
5272819 5274487 - I'm going across.<br />- I got it.
5281578 5283370 Get rid of Murphy, now!
5289086 5291170 Where the fuck do you think you're going?<br />Let's go.
5303558 5304934 Split. Get out of here.
5306728 5308270 Cover me.
5314111 5315444 Riggs!
5328458 5330209 Let's go. Let's go!
5334089 5335965 Riggs.
5339469 5341387 Son, stay still.
5351398 5353524 Happy birthday, kid.
5363243 5364410 Oh, shit!
5379217 5380593 Another baby.
5392981 5394940 Hey! Is he dead? Check the body.
5395108 5396775 Get me the fuck out of here, will you?
5398445 5400237 Hey, Riggs! Hey, Riggs!
5400530 5402948 Riggs! You stupid son of a bitch.
5414878 5416962 Stop that shit. Cut it out.
5417130 5418964 - Hey! Don't shoot.<br />- L.A.P.D., man.
5419132 5420382 Where does this come out?
5420550 5421926 - Pico Station.<br />- Thanks, pal.
5422093 5423135 Hey, not that way.
5423303 5426055 - Take the stairs, man, it's faster.<br />- Okay, thanks.
5436858 5437983 Ow!
5438151 5440361 Sorry, pal. Where's the tunnel?<br />Gangway!
5448328 5450120 Get out of the way.
5453124 5455668 Holy shit. Son of a bitch.
5456503 5457711 Police!
5464678 5466762 Step on it! There he is! Step on it!
5468390 5469848 Goddamn.
5474688 5476647 Put your foot down!
5482696 5484363 I can't!
5503717 5507052 - Hey, police! I need your bike, man.<br />- What? This is bullshit.
5507220 5511682 I need your bike. Sergeant Riggs, call it in.<br />I need a couple clips too.
5527157 5528907 Hey, we lost him.
5536041 5538167 - Central, where's Riggs?<br />- Six-William-Six.
5538335 5540669 Central, keep me in touch<br />with motorcycle pursuit.
5548261 5549928 - Shit.<br />- Take a right, now.
5550096 5551513 Take a right! Go!
5552265 5554099 Go! Go! Go!
5555101 5557394 Stupid. Take a right. No, left!
5568948 5569948 Shit!
5574913 5576080 Oh, shit!
5592430 5594139 Watch it!
5598228 5600270 This is 6-William-6, this is 6-William-6.
5600438 5602147 I'm at the freeway construction site.
5602315 5605192 Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?<br />Come back to me, Central.
5605360 5607111 Six-William-Six, location west...
5607278 5608821 Where's Riggs? Where the hell is Riggs?
5610407 5612950 Take a left here. Get off.<br />Get off the freeway.
5614327 5615577 Oh, Jesus!
5625338 5626338 Stop! Hold it!
5628174 5629258 Oh, shit!
5630135 5631552 Hang on.
5633847 5635013 Stop!
5646776 5647818 Where is the pursuit?
5652115 5653532 Oh, shit.
5665920 5670048 - Riggs! Hey, just relax, Riggs.<br />- Relax?
5671801 5673010 Riggs! Riggs!
5673344 5675971 Oh, shit!
5682020 5683729 Riggs! Riggs!
5687358 5690569 Riggs. Hey, Riggs.
5690778 5692905 Get back. Just get back. Get back!
5693573 5695908 Riggs, talk to me. Riggs.
5696075 5698827 Riggs, you're alive. Come here.
5698995 5702080 Don't move. Don't move.<br />I said just get back!
5702916 5704249 You all right?
5706586 5708295 Hey, hey, hey, Riggs, don't...
5708463 5709838 Hey, hey, Riggs!
5711382 5712549 Don't touch me!
5712717 5715594 Okay, okay. I'm not touching you.<br />I'm not touching you.
5715762 5718013 - Just be careful.<br />- Don't touch me. Don't!
5722060 5724853 - Don't touch me.<br />- Hey, okay, I won't touch you.
5725021 5726188 I'm not touching you.
5728650 5733445 - Okay. You okay now?<br />- I'm pissed now, Rog. Now I'm pissed.
5733613 5735113 - Now what?<br />- That son of a bitch.
5735281 5737199 He's done it twice now. Damn.
5737367 5740244 Son of a... I'm gonna suck<br />his eyes out through his nose.
5740495 5742621 Twice he got away.<br />Nobody gets away from me!
5742789 5745624 Okay. Just relax. Just relax.
5745959 5747793 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
5747961 5750462 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
5753174 5754466 Hey!
5755051 5756552 - Hey, I'm having that.<br />- You quit!
5756719 5758929 I ran out of biscuits, all right?<br />Give me a break.
5760640 5764476 Oh, shit.
5769148 5770315 Perfect.
5771401 5773569 - What did I miss?<br />- What's he doing here?
5773736 5775946 - What are you doing here?<br />- Great car chase.
5776114 5778073 - Great chase.<br />- What are you doing here?
5778241 5780075 - How'd you find us, huh?<br />- My police scanner.
5780243 5782244 What are you doing<br />with a police scanner?
5782412 5786748 What am I...? Hello, Car 54, where are you?<br />I cracked this case for you guys.
5786916 5789251 Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.
5789419 5791795 They got a housing project<br />called Rancho Arroyo.
5791963 5794423 - I know where that is.<br />- Why don't we check it out?
5794591 5797217 - Good idea.<br />- Okay, hey, wait. I'll come with you.
5797385 5800220 - No, you're not coming.<br />- Yes, I am. I'll take my car.
5800388 5802180 - No, you're not.<br />- Yes, I am.
5803933 5807060 I can't believe you did that.<br />I got a spare in the trunk.
5810023 5811690 - You're driving.<br />- No, I'm driving.
5811858 5814568 How could you do that?<br />I can't believe you did that.
5814736 5817195 - I can't believe you did that.<br />- Hey, where's Lorna?
5817363 5819531 - I can't believe you did that.<br />- With Walters.
5820199 5822951 I can't belie... I can't believe you did that.
5823119 5825287 How could you do that to me?
5826372 5828540 Did you see that? They're my partners.
5828708 5831376 - I can't believe they did that.<br />- Twenty-one and 18, clear.
5831544 5832878 Excuse me, do you own your home?
5866746 5869414 - Looks like we came to the right place.<br />- Yeah.
5869582 5871416 Move on out to Travis Town.
5871584 5873835 Great place to raise a family.
5874337 5876505 Built on guns and bloodshed.
5876673 5879383 One hell of a retirement plan<br />this asshole's got, isn't it?
5879550 5881927 Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.
5882512 5884971 - Say, is that, uh...?<br />- It's Darryl's gun.
5885139 5887808 - Saving it for the right occasion.<br />- This is the right occasion.
5887975 5889893 How many men you think he has?
5890061 5892437 Who knows? Maybe I should<br />run over there and ask him?
5892605 5894147 - That'd be too easy.<br />- Yeah.
5894357 5896441 Wish I had some grenades<br />or a rocket launcher.
5896609 5898402 Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
5898569 5901488 Hey, I wonder what Murphy's got<br />in his trunk.
5903783 5906243 Well, it's obvious Murph was<br />never a Boy Scout.
5906703 5908286 - Not even a good spare.<br />- Yeah.
5909956 5911289 Shit.
5912375 5914126 Put your hands down. It's embarrassing.
5917422 5919548 - How you doing?<br />- Kissing, huh?
5919716 5923051 - Fresh ones, huh?<br />- Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.
5923219 5924511 Don't get points for those.
5924679 5926555 - How did you get here?<br />- Drove.
5926723 5929224 - No, no. How...?<br />- I ran into Leo at the police station.
5929392 5930934 - He talked to me first.<br />- Leo, Leo.
5931102 5933145 - Any ideas?<br />- Lucky thing we got a plan.
5933312 5935147 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah, lucky thing. What is it?
5935314 5940235 - Oh, no. I want it to be a surprise.<br />- Oh, I like surprises.

5948494 5951037 - Let's check it out.<br />- Let's go.
5967972 5970557 - Look what they did to Murph's car.<br />- Could've been worse.
5970725 5972976 - Could've been yours.<br />- Could've been Trish's.

5985531 5986656 Oh, shit!
5996834 5998794 - Go! Go! Let's go!<br />- Yeah, yeah.
6006511 6009012 What's wrong with you?<br />I said go on three, not two.
6009180 6010555 - Nobody goes on two.<br />- On three!
6010723 6012891 - Three. It's always three.<br />- Boys! Boys!
6014143 6016436 What are we doing here?<br />Losing our heads in a crisis?

6049387 6052097 - What?<br />- Count to 20, then light me!
6056602 6057936 Shit!
6060273 6062065 Riggs, it's loaded with ammo.
6075997 6077455 - Cover me.<br />- Cover you?
6079208 6081042 Cover you, cover Riggs.<br />Cover everybody.
6081210 6083795 When's somebody gonna cover me<br />for a change?
6088593 6091052 What's that, 13, 14? Ah, to hell with it.
6107486 6110155 Jack, it's the cops.<br />They're burning everything.
6113618 6114659 God!
6121709 6124544 Son of a bitch. Shit. Crazy motherfucker!
6128716 6131676 Damn. Riggs, the ammo.<br />Get out of there.
6148194 6152155 - Riggs, you crazy son of a bitch.<br />- Yeah! Ha, ha!
6167672 6169506 Son of a bitch. It works. Shit.
6174053 6177722 Stay there. That shit works, Riggs.<br />Riggs!
6191278 6192404 Son of a bitch. No clip.
6195366 6197075 Lorna, no, don't!
6203749 6205083 Come on in, bitch.
6205751 6207585 - Door's open.<br />- Aah!

6311524 6314234 Riggs! Hey, Riggs. Riggs!
6316737 6320740 Riggs! Get up! Get up, Riggs!<br />Get up! Get up!
6321117 6322700 Killed in the line of duty, Riggs!
6327164 6330041 You'll get a great funeral<br />from the department, Riggs!
6335381 6337715 Hey, Riggs. Cop killers.
6349854 6351396 Ex-cop killers.
6361866 6363575 Go to hell, Riggs.
6364910 6366286 You first.
6375171 6377922 Hey, Riggs! Crazy son of a bitch.
6384138 6386639 Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.
6386807 6388808 Oh. Oh.
6388976 6390935 Just hold still. Hold still.
6391103 6393146 Hey, get a chopper, man. Get a chopper.
6393439 6395523 She had two vests on.<br />She's gonna be okay.
6395691 6397901 A couple of bad ones.<br />We need to get a chopper.
6398068 6401946 Okay. You're all right, partner.<br />You're all right. All right. Hang on. Okay.
6402573 6405533 It's okay, it's okay.<br />Just lie still. Just lie still.
6405701 6408912 Just a romantic evening<br />by the fire, just the two of us.
6409163 6410371 Just be still.
6413667 6417128 - Lock and load!<br />- I got it.
6420424 6422926 Honey, open your eyes. Open your eyes.
6423594 6425136 Open your eyes.
6428641 6430642 What are you trying to prove<br />out there, huh?
6431018 6432435 Huh? Why do you do that?
6433103 6434854 - Can I take this off?<br />- Yeah.
6436899 6438858 You're supposed to grow old<br />with someone...
6439026 6440652 ...not because of them, all right?
6446784 6448159 I'm gonna be with you, Lorna.
6448953 6450954 Hey, I'm with you now.<br />Look, I'm right here.
6451121 6453164 We're both here, right? Right.
6455042 6457001 Come on, I wanna be with you.
6457169 6459045 What have you got to lose?
6459964 6461005 You.
6463133 6464467 Not likely.
6469932 6472141 - Hey, Lorna.<br />- Yeah?
6474395 6476479 Let's live to regret this, huh?
6480401 6482443 - Okay, we've gotta go, sarge.<br />- Okay.
6482987 6484696 She's gonna be fine.
6488409 6489826 Can you hear me?
6491328 6492370 I love you.
6509972 6513975 Happy retirement, Daddy
6514893 6518771 Happy retirement, Daddy
6519231 6521399 This is it. This is the day.
6522276 6523359 Everybody? Daddy?
6523527 6526654 I want you to know there's a candle<br />for every year in the force.
6526822 6528614 - Yes. A lot of years.<br />- That's a lot.
6528782 6530783 - Come on, you have to blow it out.<br />- Come on.
6530951 6533536 - Blow them out.<br />- Blow them out. Come on.
6533704 6535079 - I can't.<br />- Come on, we'll help.
6535247 6539042 - No, that's not what I mean.<br />- What?
6539543 6541419 I can't retire.
6542463 6544630 I thought I could. I wanted to.
6546050 6547592 But I can't.
6551430 6553431 That means you're gonna<br />stay with the force?
6553599 6555767 That means I'm staying<br />with the force, baby.
6559146 6563274 This cake's about to explode,<br />so, uh, you better blow out these candles.
6563442 6567153 But, um, Dad, I want you to know<br />that I'm behind you all the way.
6567821 6569697 - Yeah, me too.<br />- So am I, Dad.
6569865 6572116 - It's okay.<br />- Well, the streets will be safer...
6572284 6573368 ...for another couple years.
6576205 6578915 - Word, Nick.<br />- Word, Dad.
6582002 6583544 Blow them out.
6584588 6585755 Hello?
6585923 6588132 - Hello. Up here!<br />- Hello?
6588300 6591719 - Hello. Hey, I gotta talk to Roger.<br />- Leo.
6591887 6592970 Oprah should see this.
6593138 6595640 I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.
6595808 6597266 Leo, what is it?
6597434 6600436 Where's Riggs? I didn't know<br />he could hold his breath that long.
6600604 6602647 - Okay, okay.<br />- I'm taking a bath, Leo.
6602815 6605775 I can see that. And it's cold water too.<br />There goes your image.
6605943 6608861 - Leo.<br />- Listen, I got great news, okay?
6609029 6612198 Okay? Once again,<br />Leo Getz has delivered.
6612366 6614492 Okay, I have sold this turkey.
6615369 6619789 This termite-infested dump<br />is now gone. Okay?
6619957 6623334 You have to sign the contract<br />before the suckers change their mind.
6623502 6624710 Okay? I did it. I did it.
6624878 6626337 - Hey, hey. Leo, Leo.<br />- What?
6626505 6628005 The house is off the market.
6628173 6632135 We're gonna stay in this termite-infested<br />turkey for another 10 years.
6632302 6634262 - At least.<br />- I'll get married in here.
6634430 6636931 - Come on, you guys. Come on, out.<br />- You can't do this.
6637099 6638891 - Out, out.<br />- No, you can't do that.
6639059 6641686 - You too, Leo.<br />- You can't do that.
6641854 6643020 I have contracts signed.
6643188 6645440 Because we're partners,<br />no commission. Okay?
6645607 6649152 - Partners?<br />- You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
6649319 6650361 - Why?<br />- Why?
6650529 6653197 Bullets aren't covered in normal<br />road hazard. That's why.
6653365 6657034 - I want those tires! No conditions!<br />- Oh, God. Leo, get out of here.
6657202 6659704 - Don't tell me to get out!<br />- Get out. Leo, out, out!
6659872 6661998 You're lucky your wife's here.<br />You're lucky...
6662166 6663207 - Out!<br />- Okay.
6666420 6668713 - Don't come to me if the...<br />- Get out!
6668881 6671757 - Termites get... Okay, okay.<br />- No more!
6674261 6677054 - Your friends.<br />- Yeah.
6677514 6680433 Ten more years<br />till forced retirement, huh, baby?
6681602 6685771 That's, uh, 3650 days.
6685939 6688733 - Forty-nine.<br />- Oh, yeah.
6699536 6701621 - I'll try and improve my image.<br />- Mm.
6708545 6712423 - See you soon. Thanks a lot.<br />- Don't mention it.
6712591 6714592 Oh, bye, Daddy.
6716929 6718429 Bye, baby.
6727606 6730149 - What are you smiling at?<br />- Heh.
6730317 6733486 - Why weren't you at my party, huh?<br />- I knew you weren't gonna retire.
6733654 6737406 I've been wrong about a couple things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
6737574 6739742 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6739910 6742537 I'm smoking to take my mind off<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6742704 6745748 - What dog-biscuit problem?<br />- I've been chasing more cars lately...
6745916 6748960 ...and, uh, when I try and lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
6749461 6753256 Jesus Christ. Hey, hey, hey.<br />I'm driving. Other side.
6753423 6756342 I got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.
6756510 6758010 Thank you for opening the door.
6758178 6761681 - Need some help? An old fella like you...<br />- I'll show you a fella my age.
6761848 6763683 - Who's a grumpy bastard?<br />- I'm a grumpy bastard.
6765102 6766644 - You know something, Riggs?<br />- What?
6766812 6770565 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.
6771108 6774652 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.
6774820 6776153 Well, he did it to me.
6777239 6778656 I know.
6779408 6780866 See what I mean?
6782995 6786247 - My point, exactly.<br />- Son of a bitch. Shit.
6789543 6791043 Stay away from my daughter.
6791211 6793504 - You can't be serious.<br />- What are you talking about?
6793672 6795506 I saw what it was. You kissed Rianne.
6795674 6797508 She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6797676 6800636 - That's not the point.<br />- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6800804 6803431 If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
6803599 6806642 - Getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />- I'm getting enough fiber.
6806810 6808185 I'm spoken for, okay?
6808353 6810980 I'm gonna pick Lorna up<br />from the hospital this afternoon.
6811148 6813024 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah, we're practically...
6813191 6815610 - You're serious?<br />- We got a dog and everything.
6815777 6818404 I figure I can, uh, you know,<br />make ends meet.
6827039 6830207 All units. All units. Code 2, high.
6830375 6833002 Hey, don't even think<br />about it, Riggs. Don't even try.
6833170 6836297 This is us, rolling to Code 2, high,<br />at Verrina Place.
6836465 6839258 - Shit, Riggs.<br />- This time we wait for the bomb squad.
6839426 6842011 You think I want to end up<br />in uniform again?
7024611 7028781 20-William-12,<br />the REA bomb squad's en route. All units.
7028949 7030741 Those guys gonna get in the way again?
7030909 7033702 Okay, there it is. You happy? Let's go.
7033870 7035871 Ah, we ain't seen nothing yet, though, Rog.
7036039 7038582 - Come on, just get me up there closer.<br />- It's roped off.
7038750 7041126 - Can't see the bomb squad.<br />- They're coming.
7041294 7044255 - Okay, all right. All right.<br />- Stop here and I'll just get out.
7044422 7047174 No, don't get out<br />of the car, Riggs. No. Riggs!
7047342 7049635 Tell me, Rog, was it red wire, blue...?
7049886 7052096 Let's get out of here!<br />Step on the gas.
7052264 7053681 They'll never believe this.
7053849 7056433 - I hope nobody saw us.<br />- They'll blame me.
7056601 7059854 Let's keep cool. You better get<br />your girdle out of mothballs.
7060021 7061856 They'll say, "Back in uniform again. "
7062023 7064650 - Find one that fits.<br />- Ten more years of this.
7064818 7067778 I'm too old for this shit.
