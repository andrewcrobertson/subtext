99000 99960 Riggs, Homicide.
100200 101760 - Nobody's dead.<br />- The night's young.
102000 103360 This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
103600 105040 - Threat or a scare?<br />- Real thing.
105280 106400 He saw the device.
106640 109760 It's on Level 1, by the gas pumps.<br />I wrote the license plate number.
110000 111520 That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
111760 113760 - You evacuated the building?<br />- It's clean.
114000 115560 - Where's the bomb squad?<br />- Coming.
115800 117800 Good. It's under control. Let's go.
118040 120200 I think we ought to check this out.
120440 122080 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- What?
122320 124240 - Bomb squad's coming.<br />- There's no bomb.
124480 126760 - How do you know?<br />- Because it's a full moon.
127000 129040 Moon, lunar, lunatics. They're everywhere.
129280 131080 - Is that Greek?<br />- No, Latin.
131320 133000 You surprise the shit out of me.
133240 135280 There's no bomb.<br />It's probably a false alarm.
135520 137960 It happens. He probably saw a radio<br />on the back seat.
138200 140480 Let's not mess with it.<br />Wait for the bomb squad.
140720 143720 You're right. You sit tight,<br />I'll be right back.
143960 145320 What's the matter with you?
145560 147560 - There's a bomb in there!<br />- No, there's not.
147800 149640 - There's a bomb in there!<br />- There is not.
149880 151120 There's a bomb in there!
151360 152600 - You know how I know?<br />- How?
152840 156000 I've got eight days till retirement<br />and I won't make a stupid mistake.
156240 159000 There is no bomb.<br />I'll bet vital parts of my anatomy.
159240 160920 Look.
161160 163920 Trust me. Okay?
166800 170440 That's usually my first mistake.
170880 172720 Hey, wait. I'm coming.
172960 174000 Rog?
174240 176880 - Is your insurance paid up?<br />- Of course. Why?
177120 181240 - There could be a bomb in here.<br />- Oh, God!
182400 185720 - I hate it when I'm right.<br />- Learn to trust your instincts more.
185960 187320 Oh, God.
187560 191600 The first impression<br />can often be the right one.
193640 194400 Drive shaft...
194640 198080 - I wonder if there's a bomb.<br />- Just don't touch it.
198320 201160 Just looking.
204800 209880 What are you doing? Don't open the door!
212320 214160 Son of a bitch, just look at it.
214400 217720 That's all I'll do, just look.
219280 221600 There's more plastic than Cher.
221840 223720 I love this job. This is amateur night.
223960 225600 Open the door. I can't hear you.
225840 227120 Open the door.
227360 229680 Don't do nothing.
229920 231360 Not that one!
231600 232800 You son of a bitch.
233040 235800 This is a pretty shonky job.<br />I think I can dismantle it.
236040 239920 It looks like Beirut to me. Let's go!
241560 245200 Everybody's outside. Just me, you<br />and the cat are dumb enough to be here.
245440 248480 Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh?
248720 250320 - Relax, Rog. Relax.<br />- Right.
250560 251560 Don't do nothing.
251800 254800 We've got 9 minutes and 7 seconds left.<br />You know what we can do?
255040 256320 We could drive it out.
256560 258240 Fine, it's your turn to drive.
258480 260640 No keys. I could hot-wire it.
260880 263040 Don't even say "hot-wire"<br />around this stuff!
263280 264080 You're right.
264320 266200 Why am I doing this? Why?
266440 269120 We're going to have to do it<br />the old-fashioned way.
269360 270880 What are you thinking?
271120 273360 What are you thinking?
273600 275840 - I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.<br />- Wait!
276080 278480 - That's not what I think.<br />- You think maybe the red?
278720 279760 No! No!
280000 282040 I'm thinking it's 8 minutes and 42 seconds.
282280 285440 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, and have a cappuccino.
285680 289120 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />And it's 8 minutes, 31 seconds.
289360 290160 Rog, please.
290400 291640 Forget the cappuccino.
291880 294840 - You know what they'll say?<br />- "Get the fuck out of here!"
295080 299080 But then they'll say: "Let's cut<br />the blue wire", which I'll do right now.
299320 300760 - Wait, wait!<br />- What?
301000 302360 How can you be so sure?
302600 303600 It's just a hunch.
303840 304640 A hunch?
304880 306600 Remember the bomb under your toilet?
306840 309280 - How could I forget?<br />- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
309520 312240 This is more simplified,<br />but a bit more powerful.
312480 314160 From where I sat, I couldn't see.
314400 315920 Forget it. Come on, trust me.
316160 317040 Trust you?
317280 321240 Guess not. I'm cutting the red wire, okay?
322400 323360 What? What?
323600 326320 A minute ago you said blue.
326560 327280 I did?
327520 329000 You said blue.
329240 330800 - I meant red.<br />- Sure?
331040 332400 We can do it your way if you like.
332640 334640 - My way? I don't have...<br />- Quiet!
334880 335760 I'm sure, okay?
336000 338760 Ah, shit!
340080 341760 Ready?
342000 342520 Rog?
342760 343920 What?
344160 346880 Won't you miss all this good stuff<br />when you retire?
347120 350600 Won't you miss it a little bit?
351960 353760 I'm cutting the wire.
354000 357320 Snip. All done.
360640 361520 Grab the cat!
361760 362880 Grab the cat?
363120 366640 Get out of there! Take cover!
423600 426360 Where are they?
430000 432440 Bravo.
436080 438520 Whoops.
438880 442200 Right. "Whoops."
442960 446360 Right.
449680 452440 Seven days till retirement,<br />I'm busted down to patrolman.
452680 454800 I should've cut the red wire.
455040 457120 - You did.<br />- No, I cut the blue wire.
457360 458760 That's what I meant.
459000 462320 - We should've waited for the bomb squad.<br />- Must I hear this every day?
462560 466160 - Every day until I retire!<br />- That'll be a week too long.
466400 468760 - My feet are killing me.<br />- They're killing me, too.
469000 471360 - How?<br />- I have to listen to you bitch about them!
471600 475320 - Because you should've cut the red wire!<br />- I did cut the red wire!
475560 476320 What's this?
476560 478560 It's kind of soft. Not a bulletproof vest.
478800 480200 It won't keep anything out.
480440 481760 It'll keep my stomach in.
482000 484240 What have you got under there?
484480 485680 It's a girdle.
485920 487880 What?
488120 489760 It's a girdle.
490000 490880 Does Trish know?
491120 492400 It's a man's girdle.
492640 493920 They make girdles for men?
494160 496160 - Yes, they make girdles for men.<br />- They do?
496400 498880 Yeah, they do.<br />I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.
499120 501840 - Cleaners must have shrunk it.<br />- You should take it to Chin.
502080 505600 I did take it to Chin. Look at it.<br />It shrunk all up in here.
505840 507360 I have to hold my breath.
507600 508560 Did you see that?
508800 511240 - See what?<br />- Jaywalker.
511480 512840 Jaywalking?
513080 515280 Hold it right there, pal.<br />Step up here, please.
515520 516720 - Me?<br />- Yes, you.
516960 518240 - What'd I do?<br />- Stand there.
518480 521200 Jaywalking. I saw you.<br />I'll have to cite you.
521440 523800 Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on!
524040 527320 - Should I radio for backup?<br />- Smart-ass. Can you get the ticket book?
527560 530000 There are crimes in the city<br />and you're hassling me...
530240 533200 Shut up!
534720 538160 - Do you know how to fill one of these out?<br />- A long time ago.
538400 541920 I can't read it. The print is too small<br />without my glasses.
542160 545120 Can we speed this up?<br />You may have nothing to do, but I do.
545360 548320 No, we can't, so will you shut up?
548560 550400 - Jaywalking.<br />- Ask for his license.
550640 552240 - License, for jaywalking?<br />- Yeah.
552480 555120 I don't have it on me. I wasn't driving.
555360 557840 I was walking.<br />Do I need a walking license now?
558080 559760 - Let's just shoot him!<br />- Is he crazy?
560000 562680 I'm going to drill him!<br />We'll make it look like suicide!
562920 565280 - Get out of the way!<br />- No, the video cameras!
565520 567000 I don't care! I'll drill him!
567240 569120 Get out of here, before he kills you!
569360 571760 - Go that way! Not that way!<br />- This way! Over here!
572000 572880 - Run!<br />- Now!
573120 575960 Run!
584960 586400 Wait a minute!
586640 589640 You forgot to sign.
590640 592160 What was that?
592400 595080 Wait a minute.<br />You forgot to sign the form.
595320 596160 Who are you?
596400 597640 You're not the regular guy?
597880 600160 - He's on vacation.<br />- On vacation?
600400 602560 Well, who the hell is that?
602800 605680 Get in the truck.
611600 614520 You fucking prick!
620560 621880 Are you a cop?
622120 624960 Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.<br />Will continue transmission.
625200 626080 Call 911.
626320 629200 Okay, honey. Let me drive.<br />We're in pursuit.
629440 632760 I'm driving! Don't worry.
637920 640800 This fool picked the wrong time<br />to mess with the wrong lady.
641040 643960 Just stay close.
648680 650520 Right behind you, baby!
650760 651880 Take a good look!
652120 656480 Delores the Road Warrior<br />is dead on your raggedy ass!
663440 666120 Ram him!
670840 673400 - Watch out, Riggs!<br />- Come on!
681120 682480 Are you married, sugar?
682720 684520 What? Yes, 24 years. 24 years!
684760 687640 Yeah, but is it working?
691760 695960 - You can't get closer?<br />- I am. I'm getting closer.
696960 699400 Hold on, Riggs!
707960 709680 Hold on! We got you!
709920 711880 Hold on!
712120 714000 - I told you I could do it!<br />- Closer!
714240 715960 - Get me up there!<br />- Go!
716200 718800 I am!
722440 724920 Back off!
735480 736760 If he falls, don't hit him.
737000 740520 Don't worry, I've got something for you.
776240 780680 Thanks for the interest, sugar,<br />but one thing at a time.
793080 795960 - Catch him!<br />- All right!
797200 800760 Keep singing. Just stay close.
806400 807880 Relax, baby. Relax.
808120 810000 Keep your hands off my thighs!
810240 814040 - He's in trouble. Watch out!<br />- I got him!
825120 826560 I'm getting too old for this.
826800 830200 Not for me, you're not, sugar.
832000 834640 You have the right to remain unconscious.
834880 838760 Anything you say ain't gonna be much.
841240 842880 Hey, Riggs. Are you all right?
843120 846960 I'm okay. I think we've got to book<br />this guy for not wearing his seat belt.
847200 848960 That was dynamite driving.
849200 853040 - She's a dynamite driver.<br />- I'll show you dynamite.
853280 855760 Sho 'nuff!
856000 857760 What have you two been up to?
858000 859720 What do you mean? We were in pursuit.
859960 861880 - I saw you kiss her.<br />- I didn't. She kissed me.
862120 864960 It looked mutual to me.<br />Wipe that lipstick off...
865200 868680 Hey, go spit, Riggs.
868960 870000 Are you okay?
870240 871840 Are you all right?
872080 874040 Back to bed. Back to bed.
874280 876320 Good morning, guys. Daddy.
876560 880200 How about treating your dad<br />to breakfast today?
880440 884800 - You've got six more days to go.<br />- Laundry service.
884960 886240 Hold this. Hangers?
886480 889680 I'm springing for the soap.<br />Nothing too fancy. Cute dog.
889920 891440 It's a Westie.
891680 893280 'Morning, Trish.
893520 895240 'Morning, Rog.
895480 897000 - Good morning, Nick.<br />- Spare me.
897240 899680 - What, you didn't brush your teeth?<br />- Hold it, mister.
899920 901600 Just looking for some orange juice.
901840 905320 Don't get any fingerprints on the door<br />and put the glass in the dishwasher.
905560 907040 Did somebody commit a murder?
907280 908880 Someone's coming to see the house.
909120 912320 A little mess adds to the charm.
921200 922880 How's this?
923120 925920 Isn't this great? Okay?
926160 927360 Kelly's Pool Hall.
927600 930320 Right, Kelly, hi. Let me speak to Dad.
930560 934240 Hi, honey. How are you?<br />I thought I asked you not to call me here.
934480 937840 - It's for you.<br />- Me?
938880 940440 Who is it? Hello?
940680 944160 {y:i}Hi. It's my first day at work. Are you<br />{y:i}going to come by and wish me luck?
944400 947360 - Beautiful, huh? Come on, check it out.<br />- Beautiful lawn.
947600 948720 It's great.
948960 950920 See how quiet it is here? Listen.
951160 952560 Isn't that great? Come on.
952800 954720 - It's quiet.<br />- The inside's even better.
954960 959480 - It's the people to look at the house.<br />- And our broker.
961280 962760 Just want to make sure.
963000 967080 I'll show you this room first.<br />It's my favorite.
967240 968920 Is that it? Does that say it all?
969160 970000 It's very nice.
970240 973000 I love that picture window.
973240 975520 - It's just been completely replaced.<br />- Why?
975760 978640 A drug dealer came through with his car<br />and crashed right in.
978880 980360 Shot up the whole place.
980600 984640 Son of a bitch!<br />I'm going to cut him off at the knees.
984880 988040 It's true. It's true. True.<br />Okay, anyway, look.
988280 990560 Do you like the drapes?<br />Maybe she'll leave them.
990800 992480 - I thought you quit.<br />- I did.
992720 996240 - You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.<br />- I'm itching to.
996480 998160 Here.
998400 999760 Chew on these.
1000000 1003680 I have to tell you this. It's the law.<br />It's called "full disclosure".
1003920 1007280 Anything else you want to disclose<br />before we go on?
1007520 1010720 Now that you mention it, the bathroom<br />has been completely remodeled...
1010960 1012600 ...due to unexpected bomb damage.
1012840 1014160 Hey, come on. It's okay.
1014400 1015680 Son of a bitch!
1015920 1019960 Don't, don't. You'll never sell the house.
1023280 1026320 Okay. We saw enough of the kitchen.<br />I'll show you the upstairs.
1026560 1030800 Wait till you see it.<br />It's beautiful. You'll love it.
1034560 1037080 They're gone. Leo Getz,<br />I'm going to kill him.
1037320 1039520 Son of a bitch. I'm going to kill him!
1039760 1043160 You have to let me, Riggs!
1043640 1045280 They weren't going to buy it anyway!
1045520 1048440 - You scared them away!<br />- They couldn't afford to buy it!
1048680 1050960 - Oh, I see.<br />- Okay, relax.
1051200 1054400 I had to tell them everything.<br />It's the law. "Full disclosure."
1054640 1057600 - You must have heard of it?<br />- I'm a cop. I'm the law!
1057840 1061360 - Get off me! What is it with you?<br />- Hold it!
1061600 1062600 Okay, okay.
1062840 1066680 At least he didn't tell them<br />about the nail-gun incident.
1066920 1069920 I forgot. Did you have a permit<br />when you built over the garage?
1070160 1071120 Permit?
1071360 1073640 Hold it! Leo's here. I'll take care of it.
1073880 1076720 I'll make some calls.<br />We'll get some back-dated permits.
1076960 1080840 - Which phone can I use?<br />- Sunroom.
1081920 1084400 - It must be easier than this.<br />- Count on Leo Getz.
1084640 1087840 You need less aggravation.<br />Come to work with me.
1088080 1091680 Thank you, Leo! Son of a bitch.
1103480 1106400 Did you forget something?
1110560 1111440 This.
1111680 1113760 You wear it. You sleep in it. You eat in it.
1114000 1114640 Okay?
1114880 1116800 Six more days.
1117040 1118080 And you...
1118320 1120120 ...keep an eye on him.
1120360 1122520 Sure.
1126800 1127840 She loves me.
1128080 1130280 Stop fronting yourself.<br />You know what I'm saying?
1130520 1133880 Swing with me and my crew.
1136680 1139880 - I got school.<br />- Forget school.
1141240 1143840 Here comes your pops.
1144080 1146760 - Later.<br />- All right, gotcha.
1147000 1150040 Next time.
1151560 1155080 - 'Morning, Rog.<br />- How are you doing?
1155560 1157480 Hey, Nick?
1157720 1159280 - Wasn't that Darryl?<br />- Yeah.
1159520 1162120 I haven't seen him around in a while.
1162360 1163800 He dropped out of high school.
1164040 1166000 Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.
1166240 1168560 Yeah, I know.
1168800 1170680 Hey, Nick?
1170920 1171840 Yeah, Dad?
1172080 1173680 Be good.
1173920 1176280 Word.
1177440 1178880 "Word", Nick.
1179120 1181720 Word.
1183280 1184240 "Word", Riggs.
1184480 1186040 "Word", Rog.
1186280 1187880 - What are we talking about?<br />- "Word."
1188120 1191160 Four letters. Starts with a "W",<br />"O" in the middle, "D" at the end.
1191400 1193520 Oh, yeah, that word.
1193760 1196200 "Word."
1207760 1210560 - Tyrone, my man, how are you?<br />- Jack, how's it going?
1210800 1212760 - Let's take a walk.<br />- Wait here for me.
1213000 1215520 Look around. This is my dream<br />and it's all coming true.
1215760 1220120 You sank your money into this,<br />out here in the middle of the desert?
1220360 1222560 - Know why it'll be a gold mine?<br />- Do tell.
1222800 1226320 Because no one wants to live<br />next door to a menace like you.
1226560 1229560 I came to do business,<br />not to be insulted by you.
1229800 1231160 Relax, Tyrone.
1231400 1233880 Like houses,<br />friendships need strong foundations.
1234120 1237960 Smitty, come here. Come here.
1238960 1241960 What's wrong with you?<br />Don't I pay you good and take care of you?
1242200 1245440 - Sure you do.<br />- What about the stunt you and Billy pulled?
1245680 1248640 - It was a good plan. It worked.<br />- It worked? It didn't work.
1248880 1250400 You got nailed, first time out.
1250640 1253320 Nobody who works for me<br />goes into business for themselves.
1253560 1256360 Do you understand me?<br />See how that can jeopardize everything?
1256600 1258720 - Right?<br />- Whatever.
1258960 1261440 Especially trying to pop an armored car.
1261680 1265000 Okay, Billy got caught.<br />There's nothing I can do about that now.
1265240 1267680 He'll have to face the music on his own.
1267920 1269400 But you and me...
1269640 1271000 ...we're gonna start over.
1271240 1273560 You know what I mean?
1273800 1275520 - Whatever you say.<br />- Good.
1275760 1279680 Glad you understand<br />what I'm talking about.
1284120 1288000 Now we've got a relationship<br />we can build on.
1288560 1291680 - Employee problems. You know how it is?<br />- Yeah, right.
1291920 1294240 You invest time and energy<br />into training somebody.
1294480 1297960 Then they get greedy and do something<br />stupid that jeopardizes everything.
1298200 1299240 It's a bitch!
1299480 1301520 Stick around. This is the good part.
1301760 1304840 We can put our initials in there.
1305080 1307920 Jesus Christ!
1309880 1312320 Lankershim and Vineland.<br />Where are we going?
1312560 1316040 Right here. Rianne's got a new job.<br />I promised her I'd stop by.
1316280 1318400 That's a good reason.
1318640 1322680 All right. Here we are.
1327120 1330120 - You got any silver, any change?<br />- We're cops.
1330360 1335160 That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.<br />I'll get change.
1343000 1346200 Get down! All of you!
1348480 1351280 Get down!
1366000 1367160 How do you like me?
1367400 1369600 What are you doing with a rubber gun?
1369840 1370960 This is a film.
1371200 1374080 Cut, cut! Who the fuck is this lunatic?
1374320 1376680 - Get him off my set.<br />- This isn't part of the story.
1376920 1380200 - Where did you come from?<br />- Can we get a cop on set?
1380440 1383520 Rianne, I'm so sorry.<br />I feel like a microbe right now.
1383760 1386400 - You really thought I was in trouble?<br />- I did.
1386640 1389160 A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.
1389400 1391480 - Are you a fucking idiot?<br />- I apologize.
1391720 1394800 He's a friend of mine, a policeman.<br />He thought I was in trouble.
1395040 1396040 We're both...
1396280 1397480 He's a friend of yours?
1397720 1400760 Let me tell you something:<br />You're fired. Have a nice day.
1401000 1403320 Fired? Riggs, what'd you do?
1403560 1404680 You're not fired.
1404920 1407040 No, you're not. Just take it easy.
1407280 1409280 You can't fire her for something I did.
1409520 1411600 I don't care whose mistake it was.<br />She's fired.
1411840 1413040 I apologize to everyone.
1413280 1414280 Don't push him!
1414520 1415640 All of you, go!
1415880 1417560 Just take it easy. Don't push him.
1417800 1420840 Get off my set, all right?<br />What are you, deaf?
1421080 1421880 Get off my set!
1422120 1424320 On any normal day,<br />I'd smack you in the mouth.
1424560 1425360 Is that so?
1425600 1426240 Don't!
1426480 1428160 It's a normal day.
1428400 1431000 I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay? I'm sorry.
1431240 1434320 I'm all thumbs. He fell down.<br />Let me help you.
1434560 1435960 I said don't hit him!
1436200 1437920 - Is she fired?<br />- Yes, she's fired.
1438160 1439280 - Is she fired?<br />- No, no.
1439520 1441120 - It's okay.<br />- Does she get a raise?
1441360 1443360 - Yes. I said, "yes".<br />- Good.
1443600 1447080 Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.
1447320 1450680 We'd like you to come back.
1453840 1455680 You can't settle every problem<br />with your fists.
1455920 1458800 - I couldn't use my gun with that crowd.<br />- Six more days.
1459040 1460600 I don't want to hear that anymore.
1460840 1463400 Did Rianne get her job back?<br />Did she get a raise?
1463640 1465440 I don't hear a "thank you".
1465680 1469600 Maybe I should become a Hollywood agent.<br />What do you think?
1469840 1471440 - It won't work.<br />- Why?
1471680 1473600 You don't have that killer instinct.
1473840 1475680 Son of a bitch!
1475920 1479800 - We should've put a bag on the meter.<br />- I'll put it in the glove compartment.
1480040 1481400 I don't do that anymore.
1481640 1482880 Oh, yeah? Good man.
1483120 1486720 It's full. Put it in the back seat.
1489040 1493600 - You really like those things?<br />- These? They're good.
1494600 1499000 You can eat a box of them<br />and still be dying for a cigarette.
1501080 1503880 - Did you cut yourself shaving?<br />- Yeah.
1504120 1505760 Old razor?
1506000 1508640 Old face.
1509200 1512720 You're letting this retirement thing<br />get you down.
1512960 1515680 Spend a few more years<br />getting used to the idea. Why quit?
1515920 1518480 - I've got plans for my retirement.<br />- Oh, yeah, plans.
1518720 1520280 - I do. Big plans.<br />- Big plans?
1520520 1522520 - I've had them for a long time.<br />- Like what?
1522760 1525120 Like...
1525360 1527560 - Things, man.<br />- Things.
1527800 1528600 Things.
1528840 1530360 Things I've put off for too long.
1530600 1533320 Oh, those things. I've got those, too.
1533560 1537400 I see you've given this a lot of thought.
1538400 1540240 Yeah.
1540480 1543960 I've given it a lot of thought.
1560920 1562400 Goddamn it!
1562640 1565560 - What's going on?<br />- I'm pissed off. You need a reason?
1565800 1569440 - I thought I heard gunfire.<br />- Get your hearing checked! Put that away!
1569680 1570840 What are you looking at?
1571080 1574080 Hey, man. Peace.
1594000 1597560 Why'd you call us down here?
1598320 1599520 How are you doing, son?
1599760 1603480 Does your mother know you're here?
1605520 1607680 - Did you do this?<br />- Nice shooting.
1607920 1609920 Better than Billy the Kid.
1610160 1611960 Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?
1612200 1615120 Give it to your mom.<br />Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.
1615360 1617240 - Can I borrow your glasses?<br />- Yeah.
1617480 1618480 Who's wearing?
1618720 1619880 Roger, you are.
1620120 1621800 Why me? You guys should be wearing.
1622040 1623560 Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.
1623800 1626560 I don't need help.<br />I've been dressing myself since I was 30.
1626800 1628800 - Okay, man, just trying to help.<br />- Get back.
1629040 1630600 All you perverts, turn your heads.
1630840 1634240 - Take it off, baby.<br />- Hold this shirt.
1634400 1636000 You're wearing a girdle.
1636240 1638240 - He's got a girdle.<br />- This is not a girdle.
1638480 1640160 This is not a girdle. It's my back.
1640400 1643120 My back went out on me.
1643200 1646960 I hurt my back this morning lifting weights.<br />What are you talking about?
1647200 1648320 I saw him do it.
1648560 1649840 Everybody, listen up.
1650080 1652720 I want you all to look at these.<br />Lovely bullets.
1652960 1653520 Cute.
1653760 1658640 Notice the smooth jacket.<br />Pay particular attention to the tip.
1661680 1666760 Now, you've all seen these vests stop<br />a.357 Magnum bullet.
1669400 1672240 Observe.
1684920 1687640 Son of a bitch.
1688280 1692040 - Armor-piercing bullets?<br />- Yeah, cop killers.
1692280 1695960 Those bullets came from the gun<br />of a suspect we arrested yesterday.
1696200 1698040 They're out there on the streets.
1698280 1701280 Vests are optional, boys and girls.<br />Especially boys.
1701520 1704280 See you, Riggs.
1705360 1708120 Cop killers.
1708920 1711840 Son of a bitch.
1712840 1718640 I think we should talk to Billy Phelps.<br />I'll have him brought in for interrogation.
1725360 1727680 I'm here to talk to Billy Phelps.
1727920 1730560 - Can I see your ID, please?<br />- Sure.
1730800 1734000 William Phelps, armored car suspect.<br />He's been moved to Interrogation.
1734240 1738560 - Do you know where that is?<br />- Sure. I've been there a lot.
1746200 1749240 Same floor.
1749520 1754520 I guess now you're retiring, that Swiss<br />bank account will come in pretty handy.
1754760 1757320 How much you got in there, $1 million?<br />$1.5 million?
1757560 1759200 - $5 million.<br />- $5 million?
1759440 1761120 Well, you deserve it.
1761360 1765720 It's better than those<br />miserable drug dealers getting it.
1768160 1769960 What are you talking about?
1770200 1773920 Don't sweat it. You laundered it,<br />didn't you? They can't trace it.
1774160 1775800 - They can't trace it.<br />- What?
1776040 1779080 So long as I get an invite<br />to "casa de" Murtaugh, I'm happy.
1779320 1780320 "Casa" what?
1780560 1782720 - I've never been to Portugal.<br />- Stop joking.
1782960 1783840 She's a cop.
1784080 1787800 I know she's a cop.<br />She's probably on the take, too.
1788040 1789760 The whole Force is bent.
1790000 1792480 She may be wearing a skirt,<br />but we're all brothers.
1792720 1795920 You know I have nothing.<br />I ain't been to Portugal.
1796160 1799640 Listen to me.
1801040 1803320 Son of a bitch.
1803560 1805280 - How are you doing?<br />- Fine.
1805520 1808960 - Who is it today?<br />- Billy Phelps.
1809000 1809880 Who are you?
1810120 1813200 Fly me. I'm your friendly<br />Portuguese airline.
1813440 1814640 She's Infernal Affairs.
1814880 1815680 How'd you know?
1815920 1819360 I took the liberty<br />of looking at your file folder.
1819600 1821400 Lorna Cole.
1821640 1824320 - And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- I used to be.
1824560 1827360 What's Infernal Repairs<br />want with our collar?
1827600 1828920 We're taking over, thanks.
1829160 1830920 Nobody told us they were taking over.
1831160 1833200 Nobody has to tell you anything,<br />Patrolman.
1833440 1835160 I want to go and see the captain.
1835400 1837880 You want to see the captain?<br />Let's go see the captain.
1838120 1840560 - And put on a vest.<br />- Oh, are you wearing one?
1840800 1844280 Just take it easy, man.
1854480 1857400 Hey, guys. Phelps, William.<br />Actually, his name's Billy.
1857640 1858760 You, too?
1859000 1860840 - Popular guy today.<br />- Somebody with him?
1861080 1864000 No, not really.<br />He's down the hall to the right.
1864240 1866600 Want to sign in here, Sarge?
1866840 1868080 Miss.
1868320 1871760 - What's Internal Affairs doing here?<br />- Don't start. I just found out myself.
1872000 1874160 This is Herman Walters,<br />Chief of Intelligence.
1874400 1876320 You haven't met his daughter,<br />Lorna Doone.
1876560 1877640 Pleased to meet you.
1877880 1880600 The Phelps case has been transferred<br />to Internal Affairs.
1880840 1881520 Why?
1881760 1883560 - I can't tell you.<br />- That's classified.
1883800 1886160 We busted our buns busting this guy.<br />We busted him.
1886400 1888800 Busted is right.<br />He spent the night in the hospital.
1889040 1890920 - He didn't buckle up.<br />- We even cited him.
1891160 1892880 I know, I read your report.
1893120 1895400 Our cases have, unfortunately,<br />crossed paths here.
1895640 1897840 That's all I can say.<br />We'll take over from here.
1898080 1900160 Captain, what is she talking about here?
1900400 1902840 - That's classified.<br />- No, I'm talking to him.
1903080 1904120 I'm telling you...
1904360 1906760 No, I said, "Captain".<br />I'm talking to the captain.
1907000 1909760 - That's classified.<br />- I'm talking to him.
1910000 1912840 That's bullshit!
1913440 1916000 Maybe these guys<br />can contribute something to this case?
1916240 1919000 From their records,<br />they only contribute mayhem and chaos.
1919240 1921400 No, I'm Chaos, he's Mayhem.<br />We're a double act.
1921640 1923680 What are we,<br />required reading or something?
1923920 1925360 As a matter of fact, you are.
1925600 1928120 It's a cross between "Police Gazette"<br />and "Mad" magazine.
1928360 1931040 - What's wrong with "Mad"?<br />- Nothing, I used to read it...
1931280 1932640 You've got some taste.
1932880 1935080 ...when I was 12.
1935320 1936680 - Riggs, let's go.<br />- I'm out of here.
1936920 1938720 We busted him, we can talk to him.
1938960 1941000 - Captain.<br />- Riggs. Murtaugh.
1941240 1944720 Get your asses back here.
1946280 1948480 You'll be needing these.
1948720 1950880 I'm reinstating both of you.
1951120 1953440 - Don't you just love him?<br />- Yeah.
1953680 1956160 God!
1956640 1958240 You really are a beautiful man.
1958480 1959720 Just get rid of the blues.
1959960 1964160 - They don't go with your ponytail.<br />- Absolutely not.
1964320 1965160 Yeah, right.
1965400 1966240 Get a haircut!
1966480 1967560 Of course, I won't.
1967800 1969680 You've exceeded your authority, Captain.
1969920 1972680 - That's not how I see it.<br />- That's how the chief will see it.
1972920 1974800 - Take it up with him.<br />- I think I will.
1975040 1978280 Catch up with them. We don't want this<br />screwed up with cowboy tactics.
1978520 1981120 Son of a bitch.
1981880 1984440 Hi, Billy.
1985880 1986680 Jack.
1986920 1989440 'Bye, Billy.
1995320 1998360 See you, Billy.
2003320 2005080 Sergeant, did you get what you need?
2005320 2009120 Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.
2009360 2011240 How long has Phelps been doing this?
2011480 2014120 - Doing what?<br />- This armored-car thing.
2014360 2018680 I wouldn't know.<br />I'm not interested in armored cars.
2030120 2032200 I don't think she's telling us everything.
2032440 2033560 I think you're right.
2033800 2036160 Boy, these six days are going to be rough.
2036400 2039640 God, be good to me, please.
2040400 2044200 Shit, son of a bitch knew there was<br />a camera in the wall.
2044440 2045120 Damn it!
2045360 2047800 He didn't know there was one<br />in the interrogation room.
2048040 2049720 There isn't.
2049960 2051600 We installed them six months ago.
2051840 2053280 - Every station.<br />- That's great.
2053520 2055280 Six months and we don't know about it?
2055520 2057240 This is the "police police", Captain.
2057480 2061040 "Police police." Very good. Can you say<br />that three times in a row, real fast?
2061280 2063720 - Why? Am I getting to you?<br />- Are you trying to bait me?
2063960 2065080 I'm a master at it.
2065320 2066200 That figures.
2066440 2068840 Baiting master. Great, man,<br />try all the tricks.
2069080 2070600 Freeze that. Stop it.
2070840 2072160 Jack Travis.
2072400 2073160 Who?
2073400 2076400 Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
2076640 2077600 He was one of us.
2077840 2080760 Hell of a brutal cop.<br />He could beat a confession out of anyone.
2081000 2082280 One hell of a dirty cop.
2082520 2086000 I've never seen so many suspensions<br />and reprimands and charges of misconduct.
2086240 2088480 He's also as tough as they come.
2088720 2089840 What happened to him?
2090080 2091040 I don't know.
2091280 2094920 His partner and him were on a stakeout.<br />He went for coffee, never came back.
2095160 2097520 Looks like he's had<br />one cappuccino too many.
2097760 2099440 We'd better brief Walters.
2099680 2101640 Excuse me, cute stuff.
2101880 2104920 - That's harassment.<br />- "Cute stuff." That's you.
2105160 2108400 - Captain.<br />- Boys. It's just the captain.
2108640 2111880 Your involvement in this case ended<br />when Phelps hit the floor.
2112120 2115080 Why don't you just go back<br />and beat your street?
2115320 2118080 - Now's the time to buy.<br />- Not now.
2118320 2120160 - Hey, Roger.<br />- Not now, Leo.
2120400 2122720 - Not now!<br />- We got to talk, babe, okay?
2122960 2124960 You're in trouble. You've got termites.
2125200 2126240 Termites?
2126480 2128400 - Oh, God!<br />- You're infested!
2128640 2130960 The only thing holding up your house<br />is the paint.
2131200 2132080 We should go.
2132320 2134160 Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
2134400 2136520 We should pull every file on this guy.
2136760 2138880 I know this guy.<br />Are you watching "Geraldo"?
2139120 2140400 - What?<br />- I know the guy.
2140640 2143080 - How do you know him?<br />- I've seen the guy before.
2143320 2145320 - Where?<br />- I don't know. I recognize him...
2145560 2148680 His name is Jack Travis.<br />Does that ring a bell?
2148920 2150920 Hands off the clothes. Okay?
2151160 2153480 I'm thinking. Let me think.
2153720 2155080 It was a big party.
2155320 2158400 Someone brought a monkey<br />that knocked over the salad bar.
2158640 2161680 And this guy comes in<br />and introduces me to another guy...
2161920 2163880 ...who wants a favor.
2164120 2165640 - I got it!<br />- What?
2165880 2166920 He's got it!
2167160 2169040 - I remember!<br />- You remember!
2169280 2172160 Don't do it. Don't let the earring fool you.
2172400 2174440 - We're back. We're back!<br />- Yeah.
2174680 2178520 Listen. Can I have a gun this time?
2187800 2192280 Okay, this is it! These guys always<br />wanted me to do favors for them!
2192520 2196040 Like, some guys wanted broads,<br />another guy wanted Cuban cigars.
2196280 2197880 Your guy, hockey.
2198120 2201400 The best seats in the house.
2202440 2205120 - Where're the seats?<br />- Yeah?
2205360 2207600 Probably by the glass.
2207840 2210200 Does "needle in a haystack"<br />mean anything to you?
2210440 2211720 Why don't we spread out?
2211960 2216240 If we all take a different direction,<br />it'd be like old times.
2216480 2219120 Don't push, lady.<br />I'm on police business here.
2219360 2222560 Just take it easy.
2247920 2250880 {y:i}Los Angeles penalty. Number 15.
2251120 2252840 {y:i}Two minutes for high-sticking.
2253080 2256600 {y:i}Time, 5:15.
2273120 2275760 {y:i}Mr. Jack Travis?
2276000 2279760 {y:i}Mr. Jack Travis, this is the LAPD.
2280000 2281320 {y:i}We know you're in here.
2281560 2283600 {y:i}We know where you are.<br />{y:i}Just stay in your seat.
2283840 2285120 {y:i}Don't be stupid.
2285360 2287480 {y:i}I'll be there to escort you out in a minute.
2287720 2290720 {y:i}There's a policeman at every exit,<br />{y:i}so it's no use trying to run.
2290960 2291920 Smart son of a bitch.
2292160 2293440 {y:i}Just stay where you are.
2293680 2297240 {y:i}Thanks for your cooperation.<br />{y:i}Play on, boys.
2309600 2312200 Come on, let's go!
2321040 2324320 Get out of my fucking way!
2334640 2337240 Excuse me.
2348080 2351000 You can't be on the ice!
2356280 2359320 I got him!
2360160 2364480 You have the right... You're under arrest!
2371440 2372320 Fucking weasel!
2372560 2374240 What the hell's going on here?
2374480 2376000 I'm LAPD!
2376240 2379960 I don't care. You can't be on the ice.
2384600 2385680 I got him!
2385920 2389400 You're all right, pal. Stay calm.
2390520 2392160 Make sure you tell my mother.
2392400 2393480 Where'd he go?
2393720 2396400 Down there.
2404600 2407800 Son of a bitch!
2409280 2412280 He thinks I don't know I'm dying.<br />I know it.
2412520 2415520 - You'll be okay.<br />- I'm dying, Roger.
2415760 2417320 I'm choking, see?
2417560 2419400 This is what they do when they die.
2419640 2423000 Leo, it's going to be okay.
2423000 2424960 My body's numb. I can't feel it.
2425200 2428040 I'm going to die, I know it. What?
2428280 2431480 You're lying on the ice.
2431800 2433920 - That's why I'm cold?<br />- That's why you're cold.
2434160 2436360 - That's why I'm numb?<br />- That's why you're numb.
2436600 2438400 But he shot me. Look at all the blood.
2438640 2442520 - It's just a flesh wound.<br />- So it's okay.
2446200 2451160 He's okay. He's going to make it.<br />He's alive!
2454840 2459200 - Bring him this way.<br />- I can't believe this.
2459360 2461280 - I can't believe I got shot.<br />- Calm down.
2461520 2462560 Riggs, are you here?
2462800 2465320 We're all the same now. We all got shot.
2465560 2467080 You'll be fine.
2467320 2467960 Relax.
2468200 2470880 I'm fine. There's nothing wrong with me.<br />I can take this.
2471120 2474120 Calm down. We'll take care of it.<br />You'll be out of here tonight.
2474360 2475280 It's no big deal.
2475520 2478000 That's not a good idea.<br />You shouldn't rush this, Doc.
2478240 2479240 You should rest up.
2479480 2481280 A dum-dum wound can be serious.
2481520 2483280 What's a "dum-dum wound"?
2483520 2487200 You don't know? A guy on the Force<br />got his thumb shot off by a dum-dum.
2487440 2489480 From the shock,<br />he was dead two days later.
2489720 2491040 "Dead two days later"?
2491280 2492600 He died from dum-dums?
2492840 2495080 - We'll keep you overnight.<br />- Make it two.
2495320 2496160 Two days?
2496400 2498080 Okay, we'll keep him in two days.
2498320 2499800 Is that Leo's chart?
2500040 2503040 - Two days, then you'll be as good as new.<br />- I should be with them.
2503280 2505440 I should be with...
2505680 2507240 How do you spell, "proctological"?
2507480 2509160 Rectal exam?
2509400 2512040 - No, you can't do that to Leo.<br />- Sure, we can.
2512280 2513040 Why's she...
2513280 2514920 Please, Mr. Getz.
2515160 2518280 You've been shot in the arm?<br />Let her take it. You'll get it back.
2518520 2521920 There's a clock in your room.
2521960 2523800 Does this look like a "dum-dum wound"?
2524040 2526280 - It sounded like one when it happened.<br />- Shit.
2526520 2530240 - Take it easy. Two days.<br />- Two days and you'll be out. No problem.
2530480 2533080 - I'll see you guys.<br />- We won't make a move without you.
2533320 2535280 I thought that bullet sounded different.
2535520 2538040 - Relax. They'll be there when you get out.<br />- I'm fine.
2538280 2540040 - You own your house, Doc?<br />- What?
2540280 2542040 - You don't recognize my face?<br />- No, sir.
2542280 2543960 Watch.
2544200 2544680 It's about time.
2544920 2547560 These doggy treats are okay,<br />but I need some human food.
2547800 2551040 Don't worry. I'll make you the best thing<br />you've ever had.
2551280 2553720 Good.
2553960 2557960 - You ever eaten one of my hamburgers?<br />- I've been lucky so far.
2558200 2559240 Hey, Fast Eddie.
2559480 2561560 - How's business?<br />- Booming. Can't you tell?
2561800 2564080 Yeah, I'm looking at it.<br />Did you meet my partner?
2564320 2566760 I want to cook one<br />of those monster burgers for him.
2567000 2568320 - Go for it.<br />- All right.
2568560 2569680 You'll let him cook?
2569920 2572440 - Do I have a choice?<br />- No, because it's Wednesday.
2572680 2574280 He's too big to argue with.
2574520 2576320 In that case, give me a MacRog.
2576560 2578200 Hold the hair.
2578440 2579600 Did you wash your hands?
2579840 2583200 Keep joking. But I guarantee<br />you're gonna like this burger...
2583440 2587080 ...and you're gonna come back<br />with your friends.
2587320 2590600 I haven't got any friends,<br />you know that, except you.
2590840 2593320 He's a comedian in his spare time.
2593560 2595440 When is he gonna say something funny?
2595680 2597000 Are you gonna put that out?
2597240 2598760 You're finished with it, yeah?
2599000 2602160 Do you mind? Thanks.
2602680 2604720 Sorry. I was just looking at it.
2604960 2607480 Chew on this onion.
2607720 2610120 He's quitting, so help him.
2610360 2613520 I was only looking at it.
2614840 2616360 The first thing is the fat.
2616600 2618920 Everyone says, "Cut the fat".
2619160 2622080 My uncle said, "You cut the fat,<br />you kill the burger". Right?
2622320 2622800 Yeah.
2623040 2627760 There's an art to it.<br />You just can't plop this on the grill.
2628600 2632280 Gently coax the flavors out.
2633080 2636400 Hey, what's the problem?
2641440 2644760 A little pepper,<br />then you massage it a little bit.
2645000 2646080 Just a little bit.
2646320 2650160 "Sweet, sweet meat"
2651240 2654480 Shit, man, feel it.
2656520 2657720 Okay, guys!
2657960 2659560 LAPD. Let me see your hands.
2659800 2661920 Let me see your hands. Get them up!
2662160 2667200 In the car! Get them up there!<br />Let me see both of them! Come on!
2669920 2672440 Hey, Riggs!
2681200 2684960 Don't you love me? Five days.
2691160 2692440 Don't do that to me.
2692680 2694400 - Riggs, are you okay?<br />- Yeah.
2694640 2697360 Who did it?
2698200 2699400 All right, asshole!
2699640 2703280 I want to see your hands, right now!
2727000 2729840 Back me up, Riggs.
2753000 2755760 Darryl?
2761760 2764280 Fuck, no!
2766000 2769400 Call an ambulance!<br />Call an ambulance! Breathe!
2769640 2771320 Please, breathe.
2771560 2772680 Breathe!
2772920 2775480 Call an ambulance!
2775720 2777760 Come on! Breathe! Oh, God!
2778000 2781000 Fuck, it's Darryl!
2781440 2783240 Oh, God, don't do this to me! Breathe!
2783480 2785800 - He's dead.<br />- Breathe!
2786040 2788360 - God, don't do this!<br />- He's dead.
2788600 2790720 Rog, he's dead!
2790960 2793480 He's dead, Rog.<br />Don't mess with the corpse.
2793720 2796680 He's dead. Come on, man,<br />it was a clean shoot.
2796920 2798760 It's okay, it was a clean shoot.
2799000 2801000 He was gonna do you<br />and he was gonna do me.
2801240 2803280 It's okay. Are you okay?
2803520 2805960 It's not okay.
2806200 2809120 I know that kid.
2810280 2812640 I know that kid.
2812880 2816000 He's Nick's friend.
2831400 2833600 - I got it, Mom.<br />- I'll get it.
2833840 2835000 Hello?
2835240 2836920 Hi, Martin.
2837160 2839920 He's not here.
2845720 2848880 Oh, my God!
2850280 2853040 Thanks.
2880120 2882640 Fuck!
2887080 2888840 How are you doing? Taking your vitamins?
2889080 2892360 - Riggs, how's Murtaugh?<br />- He's good. He's fine.
2892600 2895360 - I'm sure he's anything but fine.<br />- Really, he's okay.
2895600 2898840 - I'd really like to talk to him.<br />- That's not such a good idea.
2899080 2901120 The best thing to do is to leave him alone.
2901360 2905800 - Let's get something for your cold.<br />- I know what I'm talking about.
2906040 2908800 - We have to talk.<br />- Talking to you is bad for my image.
2909040 2910920 - I'm afraid I insist.<br />- Oh, you insist?
2911160 2916400 In that case, let's find someplace private.<br />Step into my orifice.
2920760 2923400 - Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?<br />- Hey, Riggs.
2923640 2927560 - Clip any wrong wires lately?<br />- I haven't done that for a couple of days.
2927800 2929720 Next time, wait for the bomb squad.
2929960 2930920 Yeah, it's our job.
2931160 2933480 I'll remember that.<br />We saved a cat, though.
2933720 2936920 Great. I love cats.
2937280 2938840 Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.
2939080 2943040 You purposefully withheld information<br />concerning a case under my investigation.
2943280 2944400 Damn right, I did.
2944640 2946480 Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
2946720 2949400 You had a tip on Travis.<br />You should have shared it with me.
2949640 2950720 No, I take that back.
2950960 2953280 You were required to share it with me.
2953520 2955840 I was "required" to share it with you?
2956080 2957920 I don't have to share shit with you.
2958160 2961320 Schoolyard rules: If you don't scratch<br />my back, I don't throw you...
2961560 2964360 - Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that!<br />- Yes, you can!
2964600 2966720 Why don't you cut out<br />this classified bullshit!
2966960 2968880 Right now! It's giving me the shits!
2969120 2972480 We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.<br />We're both on the same side, right?
2972720 2973600 - Right?<br />- Right!
2973840 2976280 Good! Why don't we start to act like it?
2976520 2978640 There are kids out there.<br />Babies. No brains.
2978880 2980480 But they got automatic weapons.
2980720 2985320 - Yesterday, my partner nailed this kid...<br />- I know about Murtaugh.
2986120 2988960 And I'm sorry, Riggs.
2989200 2991600 Yeah.
2995240 2997480 Why don't you let me in on this?<br />I can help you.
2997720 3000760 I really want to help you,<br />if you'll let me. Let me.
3001000 3004480 What do you say? Have we got a deal?
3006840 3009600 Wash your hands...
3010720 3014320 ...and meet me in my office.
3015360 3018240 I'll be right there.
3018440 3020280 I'll be right there.
3020520 3022240 MAC-10, 9-mm, semi-automatic...
3022480 3025400 ...converted to automatic<br />with 36 rounds in the magazine.
3025640 3027320 "On a sesame seed bun."
3027560 3028840 Very illegal.
3029080 3031080 That gun has a history.<br />Wanna know about it?
3031320 3033680 Tell me.
3035000 3037960 "Killed a convenience store clerk<br />in LA County, July 1990."
3038200 3042360 "Used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990."
3042600 3047240 "Confiscated by a truant officer<br />of the LA School Board, October 1990."
3047480 3049800 Scheduled for destruction by the LAPD<br />six weeks ago.
3050040 3052360 "Scheduled" for destruction.
3052600 3055760 But it never got there.
3056160 3059000 Instead, it found its way<br />into the hands of a 15-year-old boy...
3059240 3061520 ...who fired it on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3061760 3063160 I thought it looked familiar.
3063400 3065200 That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3065440 3068920 ...were stolen from a police storage facility<br />before they could be destroyed.
3069160 3071720 They should be paper clips right now,<br />or license plates.
3071960 3075320 Anything but a gun. Here we are<br />busting our asses on the streets...
3075560 3079440 ...getting these weapons out of circulation<br />and now they're headed back out.
3079680 3084120 By busting Phelps, you stumbled onto<br />something the LAPD's tried to keep quiet.
3084360 3087800 That's why Internal Affairs is onto this.<br />They think this is an inside job.
3088040 3090080 That's right. They knew police procedures.
3090320 3092760 They knew where the guns were stored<br />and how to get in.
3093000 3095480 They even knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3095720 3098520 ...because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3098760 3100840 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />- Or an ex-cop.
3101080 3101840 Right.
3102080 3104520 Travis.
3105400 3108360 And you let him slip through your fingers.
3108600 3110280 That's closer than you ever got.
3110520 3111840 Close, Riggs?
3112080 3116400 Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window.
3117360 3118920 Do you want to go for a ride?
3119160 3120960 Sure, where are we going?
3121200 3124000 It's a surprise.
3127240 3129200 Oh, I love surprises.
3129440 3130360 What is this place?
3130600 3133080 I accessed Billy Phelps'phone records<br />on my computer.
3133320 3135200 He made a dozen calls to this address.
3135440 3137680 That was nice of you<br />to steal that information.
3137920 3139400 - Semantics, Riggs.<br />- "Semantics"?
3139640 3142040 I'm always up for some antics.
3142280 3144040 Let's go on three.
3144280 3145080 One.
3145320 3147320 - On three, or three and then go?<br />- What?
3147560 3151040 Never mind. One, two, three.
3152120 3154680 I've got you.
3166560 3168760 It looks like Billy's grandmother<br />owns a big dog.
3169000 3170720 It's not a dog. It's a horse.
3170960 3173080 I hate dogs, Riggs.
3173320 3174400 I don't get it.
3174640 3177960 You don't get what?<br />It's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
3178200 3182520 I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window." I don't get it.
3182760 3185280 Later.
3188720 3190080 What are you doing?
3190320 3193240 I can't shoot a dog.<br />People, okay, but not dogs.
3193480 3195640 I should try to make friends with him.
3195880 3197960 "Make friends"?
3198200 3203120 Now don't run, because he'll only<br />chase you down and kill you.
3203960 3205160 Here, boy.
3205400 3207920 Here, boy.
3213720 3214440 Shit!
3214680 3217360 Good boy.
3223760 3226320 Riggs?
3229800 3232640 You're crazy.
3250440 3251840 Want some?
3252080 3254560 Are you hungry?
3254760 3256240 You're a hungry boy.
3256480 3260200 Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
3261560 3263640 Here's one. Leave some for me.
3263880 3267280 Very slowly, as if you're not here,<br />just walk away.
3267520 3268600 You want me to go?
3268840 3270440 Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
3270680 3272040 "Guy sort of thing"?
3272280 3275040 Are you all alone in here?
3282360 3284920 Stay, stay.
3285480 3288560 Come on, let's go.
3307400 3308520 How many is that?
3308760 3312440 - Fifty-five.<br />- Fifty-five. All right, we've got eight more.
3312680 3316080 We'll get these later. Let's go.
3318400 3320120 Hi, fellas.
3320360 3323520 What's in all these boxes?
3331960 3337560 Easy, let's not kill him, yet.<br />Let's see who he is first, all right?
3338040 3339680 You have the right to remain silent.
3339920 3341720 Shut him up!
3341960 3345360 "Sergeant Martin Riggs."
3346160 3347720 - Get the truck ready.<br />- Right.
3347960 3349520 So, Sergeant Riggs...
3349760 3351160 ...how did you find us?
3351400 3353720 Freeze! Police!
3353960 3355400 Another one?
3355640 3357160 We need a new fucking dog.
3357400 3359160 Get your hands up, asshole.
3359400 3362120 Get them up!
3364080 3365280 A little bit higher.
3365520 3367560 That's better.
3367800 3370560 Very good.
3372920 3375600 Drop it, miss.
3376280 3378800 Now, look!
3424120 3427080 Okay, I'm on! No, wait!
3427320 3430320 Wait, wait!
3432040 3433280 Sergeant Cole!
3433520 3436640 Get down!
3438840 3442360 Get those cases and kill that dog!
3451920 3453120 Stop!
3453360 3453960 The dog.
3454200 3457160 - Where'd you learn to fight?<br />- Catholic school. Forget the dog!
3457400 3459160 Here, boy! We're waiting for the dog!
3459400 3460320 Hold it.
3460560 3461720 Come on, dog!
3461960 3465720 Good dog. Good puppy. Go!
3466600 3467800 Stop!
3468040 3468800 What?
3469040 3470520 - It's full of guns.<br />- Grab one!
3470760 3472280 - You grab one!<br />- Chicken.
3472520 3474880 Step on it.
3477520 3481280 Get that crate! Come on!
3485080 3489280 {y:i}Hatchett, you said not to worry about<br />{y:i}the police, but the cops are all over you!
3489520 3491880 They got my guns.<br />They'll come after me, next!
3492120 3494160 As far as I'm concerned, the deal's off!
3494400 3497200 Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone.<br />We have a deal.
3497440 3498400 Nobody backs out.
3498640 3500600 {y:i}You said you had the cops under control.
3500840 3502840 I see that isn't so. Give me one reason...
3503080 3504800 {y:i}... why I should do business with you.
3505040 3506480 I'll give you a good reason.
3506720 3508280 Tyrone, this is Travis.
3508520 3512520 You back out now, and I'll make sure<br />only your dentist can identify the body.
3512760 3516640 Is that a good enough reason for you?
3517320 3518760 But I need ammo.
3519000 3520880 I'm out of business without ammo.
3521120 3522400 I need the good stuff.
3522640 3525880 You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3526120 3527520 "The good stuff." Jesus.
3527760 3531440 Time to pay another visit to the LAPD.
3531720 3535120 You look like I feel.
3546480 3548480 Have you got anything<br />I can put on my head?
3548720 3550000 There's a hat in the closet.
3550240 3554880 You're all heart. Here, I thought<br />you'd get all tender and maternal.
3555120 3556880 I was raised with four brothers.
3557120 3561440 We got hurt often, but if no bones were<br />broken or blood gushed, nobody cared.
3561680 3562920 Look, blood. See? Blood.
3563160 3564480 It's not gushing.
3564720 3567040 It was free flowing earlier.
3567280 3573280 Could you bring me a needle and thread?<br />Some peroxide. I'll patch it up myself.
3574560 3575920 Don't touch anything.
3576160 3578920 I wasn't.
3579120 3582200 What's with you?
3596880 3598320 What are you doing?
3598560 3601000 - I said not to touch anything.<br />- It came on by itself.
3601240 3603120 All by itself? What are you, a wise guy?
3603360 3605200 You don't like to share your toys, do you?
3605440 3607120 - This isn't a toy.<br />- What is it?
3607360 3609040 - This is a weapon.<br />- A weapon?
3609280 3611360 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3611600 3613360 What, do you throw it at people?
3613600 3616160 You'll give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3616400 3617360 Right here.
3617600 3621720 - Take a little off the top...<br />- Right here.
3625520 3627480 Do you bring all your interrogations home?
3627720 3629920 - What are we talking about?<br />- It's back here.
3630160 3631720 - Careful, careful.<br />- Turn your head.
3631960 3633200 - Careful.<br />- This?
3633440 3635840 - This scratch?<br />- It feels like the Grand Canyon.
3636080 3637680 Oh, God.
3637920 3640040 Hold still.
3640280 3643280 Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3643520 3645200 Be gentle with me.
3645440 3648720 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3648960 3651760 That's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3652000 3654520 - That's a natural mistake.<br />- What, I have a wooden head?
3654760 3656040 - Look at that.<br />- A knife.
3656280 3658000 Knife? That's very nice.
3658240 3659240 This is all right.
3659480 3661760 That's a pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw.
3662000 3664800 That's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this.
3665040 3666920 Same thing. Third and Highland.
3667160 3669720 - Dragged for about half a block.<br />- That's a good one.
3669960 3672000 Feel that texture. Cheese-grater time.
3672240 3674040 - Moving truck.<br />- Moving truck?
3674280 3675080 Moving bullet.
3675320 3678240 - Moving bullet?<br />- Here. This is the best.
3678480 3681080 - It goes all the way through to the back.<br />- Right through?
3681320 3682800 You're lucky. Was it a.22?
3683040 3684400 It's a.38.
3684640 3687280 - It's a.38.<br />- That? That's wimpy. This is a.38.
3687520 3690200 Yours is bigger than mine?<br />I don't think so.
3690440 3691600 Maybe not, but look.
3691840 3694600 A whole family of.44s on the back.
3694840 3695680 There they are.
3695920 3696960 That's impressive.
3697200 3700320 One hit my lung. I was breathing<br />blood bubbles. It was disgusting.
3700560 3701680 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3701920 3703680 You got one?
3703920 3707040 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3707680 3709880 Right down here. Went through.
3710120 3711480 - That must have hurt.<br />- Right.
3711720 3712520 Not too close.
3712760 3714840 Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
3715080 3717320 I can beat it.
3717560 3719840 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- You gotta see this.
3720080 3721840 - I believe you.<br />- This guy had a knife.
3722080 3726000 You'll love it. He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3726240 3728160 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- Look!
3728400 3729640 No, I said forget it.
3729880 3731240 This is a blue-ribbon event.
3731480 3733280 Forget it.
3733520 3734600 You started this.
3734840 3737280 - Yeah, I can end it.<br />- You know what?
3737520 3740320 You're a very poor loser.
3740440 3741360 I didn't lose.
3741600 3743720 - Yes, you did.<br />- No, I didn't lose.
3743960 3745120 - You lost.<br />- I conceded.
3745360 3747600 There's a difference between losing<br />and conceding.
3747840 3749560 You conceded or you're conceited?
3749800 3751400 - You think I'm conceited?<br />- Yeah.
3751640 3753440 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3753680 3754840 I'll get you a Band-Aid.
3755080 3759120 - Tell me you lost.<br />- I said don't touch anything...
3769280 3772320 You're going to smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
3772560 3775840 I can do better than that.
3790800 3793720 This could be a serious ethical breach here.
3793960 3796160 I never made it<br />with another sergeant before.
3796400 3799040 Shut up, Riggs.
3832440 3836240 {y:i}I'm as hungry as a whale.<br />{y:i}Bring on the food.
3836760 3838480 He's got a sense of humor.
3838720 3842040 Watch this. This is a good bit.
3845920 3849440 I think you're gonna get on just fine.
3854160 3857560 If you could pry yourself away<br />from doggie heaven, I'm finished out here.
3857800 3862240 - You wanna take a look?<br />- Sure. Let's go outside for some air.
3864320 3865600 One for you.
3865840 3867120 One for you. No favorites.
3867360 3869480 I just have to finish the flashing here...
3869720 3872120 ...and the roofing shingles<br />about another few bundles.
3872360 3874440 Unless it rains, it should hold up all right.
3874680 3877280 That's comforting.
3880000 3882720 I like a man who takes pride in his work.
3882960 3884600 Do you know where I can find one?
3884840 3886880 Like trying to find a cop<br />when you need one.
3887120 3888480 We're not mind readers.
3888720 3890400 You have to have a mind to read.
3890640 3891600 Read it and weep.
3891840 3894240 With these prices<br />you're promoting graft in the port.
3894480 3898520 If there's anybody<br />who knows about graft, it's you.
3898560 3901480 - Hi, Martin.<br />- How are you doing?
3901720 3903000 - Hi, Mickey.<br />- Hi, Rianne.
3903240 3905400 What are you doing here?
3905640 3906920 Or shouldn't I ask?
3907160 3909000 You got a sink to unplug?
3909240 3910800 - I got your sink.<br />- Good. Go do it.
3911040 3913840 I'll see you next week.
3918200 3919880 What's up?
3920120 3921840 Dad didn't come home last night.
3922080 3925040 He always comes home.
3954160 3957440 Oh, damn, Riggs.
3958320 3959360 What do you want?
3959600 3961600 I just wanted to see how you were doing.
3961840 3963640 Who sent you? Trish?
3963880 3966040 You're doing pretty well.<br />Trish didn't send me.
3966280 3968600 Rianne came to see me.<br />She asked me to find you.
3968840 3969720 To your place?
3969960 3971120 Well, that's where I am.
3971360 3975040 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Yeah.
3975280 3979360 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Come on, she was worried.
3979600 3981240 Get off of my boat, Riggs!
3981480 3983160 - Come on.<br />- Get off my boat!
3983400 3984720 You're drunk.
3984960 3986960 That's something you should know about.
3987200 3989680 - This isn't going to do you any good.<br />- Give me that.
3989920 3990800 Give me that.
3991040 3992720 Roger, please don't do this.
3992960 3995920 You got three days until you retire.<br />This won't do you any good.
3996160 3998640 You self-righteous bastard! Give it...
3998880 4000520 Don't do this, okay? Please?
4000760 4002960 Give it to me, damn it.
4003200 4006560 What are you going to do now, shoot me?
4006800 4007560 There.
4007800 4010240 Take your finger out of my bottle.<br />Give me that gun.
4010480 4012640 The bottle's going sailing.
4012880 4015840 Son of a bitch!
4018600 4019920 Not bad for an old man.
4020160 4021200 Are you finished?
4021440 4024000 No, I got another bottle in the galley<br />and I'll get it.
4024240 4025200 No, you're not.
4025440 4027320 Don't do this to yourself.
4027560 4030160 You gotta cut this out.
4030400 4032720 Oh, man, I'm sorry. Are you okay?
4032960 4036000 Come on. Sit down.
4036440 4037920 - You hit me.<br />- Cool it, will you?
4038160 4039840 Cut it out. Give it up, okay?
4040080 4041040 Go ahead.
4041280 4042960 Go ahead. Hit me again.
4043200 4045560 I don't want to hit you.<br />You think I like this shit?
4045800 4048240 Hit me again. You think I'm afraid of you...
4048480 4050800 - I know you're not.<br />...and that kung-fu shit?
4051040 4053120 Please, Rog.
4053360 4056560 That kid was a killer, all right.<br />That wasn't a toy in his hand.
4056800 4060120 That was a machine pistol<br />with twin carbines and all the trimmings.
4060360 4063680 He would have drilled you, me,<br />anybody that came along.
4063920 4065360 You had no choice.
4065600 4067680 It didn't happen to you. It happened to me.
4067920 4069200 It happened to me!
4069440 4071440 My God, I killed that kid!
4071680 4072880 I killed that boy.
4073120 4074880 You've killed a lot of people.
4075120 4078320 You've killed a fucking lot of people!<br />You don't kill a baby.
4078560 4081560 You've got ice in your veins.<br />You don't kill a boy like Nick.
4081800 4083200 You selfish bastard!
4083440 4085040 You selfish bastard!
4085280 4087440 You're just thinking about yourself.
4087680 4089360 What about me?
4089600 4092400 We're partners. We are partners.
4092640 4094240 What happens to you, happens to me.
4094480 4097520 After all the shit we've been through,<br />don't you get it?
4097760 4099760 Don't you get it?
4100000 4103160 When you retire, you're not just<br />retiring you, you're retiring us.
4103400 4105440 - You're retiring us.<br />- That's not my problem.
4105680 4106400 Yes, it is.
4106640 4109160 - It's not my problem.<br />- You're the only family I've got.
4109400 4112200 I've got three beautiful kids.<br />I love them and they're yours.
4112440 4115440 Trish does my laundry.<br />I live in your icebox. I live in your life!
4115680 4117040 What am I going to do?
4117280 4118640 - I don't care.<br />- Yes, you do.
4118880 4120160 - I don't care.<br />- Yes, you do.
4120400 4121400 I don't care!
4121640 4122560 Yes, you do!
4122800 4124560 - I don't care.<br />- You do so.
4124800 4127680 I don't care!
4131120 4135360 I don't know what I'm saying anymore.<br />I don't know what I'm thinking.
4135600 4139200 I had three days, and now this.
4139360 4140400 I'm sorry.
4140640 4144440 - That's all right.<br />- No, I'm really sorry.
4144680 4148000 I didn't realize that my retirement<br />was gonna screw you up.
4148240 4152600 Forget it. I haven't got any problems.<br />I was out of line saying that shit.
4152840 4154960 Look, man...
4155200 4157920 Riggs, look...
4157960 4159920 You know I love you.
4160160 4165200 You know I love you, Riggs.<br />And your problems are my problems.
4165440 4168080 Like you said, "What happens to you...
4168320 4170400 ...happens to me." So try me.
4170640 4172360 I'm here for you.
4172600 4175080 I haven't got any problems.
4175320 4179160 Yes, you do. We all have problems.<br />You help me...
4179400 4182480 ...and I'm gonna help you.
4183840 4187280 I do have a little problem.
4187280 4189760 You don't want to hear it.<br />This is piddly shit.
4190000 4191640 Yes, I do. I want to hear it.
4191880 4193720 - Tell me.<br />- This is ridiculous.
4193960 4196720 - You don't want to hear it.<br />- No. I'm here.
4196960 4198720 Well...
4198960 4204240 I think maybe I slept with someone<br />that I probably shouldn't have.
4204640 4207520 You son of a bitch!
4212960 4213880 Help me.
4214120 4216240 I ought to let you drown, you traitor.
4216480 4217480 Help me.
4217720 4220680 Come on in.
4223160 4224360 What did you hit me for?
4224600 4227640 'Cause you slept with Rianne.
4227880 4228680 I did not.
4228920 4232160 - Who did you sleep with?<br />- I slept with Sergeant Cole.
4232400 4233840 Sergeant Cole from Traffic?
4234080 4235960 No, not Sergeant Cole from Traffic.
4236200 4239000 Lorna. Sergeant Cole from Traffic<br />is her uncle.
4239240 4243200 - Okay. That's okay.<br />- Oh, I don't know.
4244400 4245520 Sheriff's Department.
4245760 4246560 Sheriff...
4246800 4249120 We're LAPD.
4249360 4251760 What are you boys doing down there?
4252000 4254320 - We're in the middle of a case.<br />- Yeah.
4254560 4257120 Of Scotch.
4257800 4260880 Let's get out of here.
4273920 4277120 Go with the grain.
4278920 4282000 I'll show you. Here.
4282880 4286240 You're going against the grain.
4289280 4292080 - Like that.<br />- Okay.
4297440 4300000 Are you okay?
4301680 4305120 Darryl was my friend, Dad.
4305280 4308360 I know. I'm sorry, son.
4308600 4311600 I hope you don't blame me.
4311840 4314160 I don't blame you, Dad.
4314400 4317280 I blame Darryl.
4319920 4322880 What's this right here?
4327440 4330400 I love you, Dad.
4331840 4335040 I love you, son.
4353280 4356640 "May he find the peace in Heaven<br />that eluded him on Earth."
4356880 4358480 "And may the scourge of violence...
4358720 4362040 ...claiming the lives of our children<br />be lifted by Your grace...
4362280 4364480 ...and infinite wisdom."
4364720 4367280 "Amen."
4392800 4395360 Wait here.
4399680 4400920 Mrs. Smithers...
4401160 4403680 Ma'am?
4405600 4408560 I just don't know...
4413440 4415680 You want to do something,<br />Sergeant Murtaugh?
4415920 4417200 You find the man...
4417440 4421040 ...that put the gun in my son's hand.
4437200 4440320 Take your mama to the car.
4443680 4445240 Are you okay?
4445480 4447000 Yeah.
4447240 4450040 Who's got the gun?
4450400 4453520 - You got it.<br />- Yeah.
4459040 4463040 - Where did this gun come from?<br />- Fuck you!
4463280 4466480 Ever heard of the word "genocide"?<br />Have you, stupid motherfucker?
4466720 4468280 Have you ever heard of genocide?
4468520 4470920 You fools are killing yourselves!<br />You're killing us!
4471160 4472880 I'm tired of it!
4473120 4476320 You'd better tell me where this<br />comes from or I'll blow your head off.
4476560 4480240 I want to know, now!<br />Where did it come from?
4484840 4489240 Do you see this gun? I want to know<br />where it came from. Now!
4489480 4490600 I want a name!
4490840 4493640 Do you see that car?<br />I want a name, asshole!
4493880 4495960 I want a name! I want a name now!
4496200 4496760 One!
4497000 4498160 Are you crazy?
4498400 4500520 Ready?
4500880 4504320 Watch your hands.<br />That tire will rip them right off.
4504560 4506240 - Two!<br />- I'm getting excited.
4506480 4508240 Very excited.
4508480 4513480 - Your face is going to be a skidmark!<br />- No!
4513480 4515280 It's Jack Travis!
4515520 4516880 That's what I wanted, baby.
4517120 4519280 Three!
4520880 4523480 Wrong...
4525160 4528240 Women drivers, baby.
4532120 4534000 We're looking for your friend, Travis.
4534240 4536280 I've never heard of him.
4536520 4537840 Wrong answer.
4538080 4539880 You're pulling on the wrong string.
4540120 4541800 That's not a very professional attitude.
4542040 4543160 Who the fuck are you guys?
4543400 4544400 Sorry, LAPD.
4544640 4548680 We're doing a few routine inquiries.<br />Have you been checked for lumps recently?
4548920 4550200 Give me my fucking wallet!
4550440 4551720 Keep your hands down!
4551960 4553080 My fucking wallet!
4553320 4556440 Get up! We don't need this.
4556680 4560680 We have a license that belongs to Hubert<br />Bartholomew Smith. Nice picture.
4560920 4561640 Fuck you!
4561880 4564960 Hey, there's a lady here.
4565720 4568680 What the hell's going on here?
4568920 4570960 - Maybe they know something.<br />- I'll go find out.
4571200 4575040 - Want me to come with you?<br />- No, I got it.
4575520 4576960 Maybe I should go with her.
4577200 4580280 No, I want you to see something.<br />She has a gift. Watch this.
4580520 4582480 Good morning, gentlemen. LAPD.
4582720 4583920 I've got a few questions.
4584160 4585320 Are you on parole?
4585560 4588000 - I got a job...<br />- Who asked you?
4588240 4589960 Do any of you know a Mr. Travis?
4590200 4591400 You got a warrant?
4591640 4593040 No, but I can get one.
4593280 4594320 Until you do...
4594560 4595800 ...fuck off.
4596040 4598120 That's not a nice thing to say to a lady.
4598360 4599640 Fuck you.
4599880 4602680 I don't think so.
4604520 4607200 Backspin kick.
4615040 4616160 Are you okay, honey?
4616400 4618920 Just great.
4623800 4625400 - "Honey"?<br />- How are you doing?
4625640 4627120 This guy's on parole.
4627360 4629040 This guy's an asshole!
4629280 4632960 - Riggs, there's five of them.<br />- I know.
4633760 4636360 Look at that.
4642880 4645760 Grabbed his clusters!
4646440 4648120 Let me help her.
4648360 4650880 Stay still.
4662040 4664600 My girl.
4665240 4668840 This PMS is murder.
4668840 4670120 I know what you mean.
4670360 4672760 I've been married 25 years.
4673000 4674760 So, tell me about Travis.
4675000 4677680 I told you before, moron,<br />I don't know Jack Travis.
4677920 4679520 I didn't say his name was Jack.
4679760 4683320 You better start telling me<br />more than jackshit.
4685240 4688520 - Men cross the street when they see me.<br />- I didn't have enough time.
4688760 4692280 I'm not your enemy, Captain.<br />I'm just trying to do my job.
4692520 4695240 - Have you eaten?<br />- I already ate. I've gotta go downtown.
4695480 4697440 - What, do you eat alone?<br />- I'm used to it.
4697680 4699040 It's bad for the digestion.
4699280 4703480 Tomorrow, you'll have lunch with me,<br />but I'm not paying.
4708440 4710440 Are you all right?
4710680 4713320 Two fingers, Murph.
4713560 4718440 - Jack, what the fuck?<br />- Get in the car. I'll tell you on the way.
4723320 4725880 After watching Lorna<br />handle herself so well...
4726120 4728240 ...I'm changing my mind about kung fu.
4728480 4730160 Want to try it sometime?
4730400 4731960 - No.<br />- Come on.
4732200 4734480 You can't teach an old dog new tricks.
4734720 4736680 "Old dog", my ass.
4736920 4740120 Let's try something. Watch this.<br />It's called a backspin kick.
4740360 4742320 Pivot on the right, kick with your left...
4742560 4745400 ...and you whip that head around<br />to catch the target over there.
4745640 4748000 Like this. Get that head around<br />and follow through.
4748240 4749080 Like so.
4749320 4751720 So you whip the head.
4751960 4753320 All right?
4753560 4756280 Thank you. Now you try it.
4756520 4758280 Here's your target. All right?
4758520 4762440 Remember, pivot right, kick left,<br />get that head around, spot that target.
4762680 4764880 - Like that.<br />- Yeah. Follow the head around.
4765120 4767760 Back up a bit. We don't want you<br />to bump into the pole.
4768000 4770640 Just back up a little bit.<br />A little bit more. Okay, good.
4770880 4772680 Mind and body strong, now, grasshopper.
4772920 4774360 Okay.
4774600 4776840 Go.
4782960 4784120 He can't hold his water.
4784360 4786040 Get back to work!
4786280 4788120 Okay, back to work, everybody.
4788360 4792280 Oh, Rog, I'm sorry.
4792320 4795440 Sergeant Murtaugh,<br />you could be experiencing...
4795680 4799120 ...some transitional anger<br />caused by the shooting.
4799360 4801720 Do you want to talk about it?
4801960 4804560 - He's okay for a change.<br />- Are you sure?
4804800 4808040 You look good in red. That's your color.
4808280 4813080 - I've got a little extra time now.<br />- I'm fine, Doctor.
4816960 4817960 Oh, shit!
4818200 4819960 Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?
4820200 4821000 What?
4821240 4822600 It's her.
4822840 4826760 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the good-looking Sergeant Murtaugh?
4827000 4828440 Hi, skinny!
4828680 4830720 - Delores. Remember me?<br />- I remember you.
4830960 4833800 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
4834040 4839000 Actually, he's cowering down<br />on all fours right behind this counter.
4840200 4843120 - Where is the sergeant?<br />- He's not here right now.
4843360 4845520 But he's talked of nothing but you all week.
4845760 4846680 Shut my mouth.
4846920 4848120 The man's on fire.
4848360 4850440 - What's the matter, baby?<br />- A little sciatica.
4850680 4853080 You tell him Delores was here.
4853320 4854880 You tell that man...
4855120 4858000 ...that he's the jam in my jellyroll.
4858240 4861080 I'll see you, baby, okay. Bye-bye.
4861320 4863720 See you.
4863920 4866640 Delores says<br />you're "the jam in her jellyroll".
4866880 4868440 I heard.
4868680 4870360 That's a lot of woman.
4870600 4871880 She calls me all the time.
4872120 4874200 She leaves me notes.<br />What am I going to do?
4874440 4875960 You shouldn't have led her on.
4876200 4880000 Led her on? I didn't do anything.
4882080 4884480 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4884720 4887240 You've got to come see me.
4887480 4889800 We've got to work. Come on. Let's go.
4890040 4893440 - Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />- Thanks, Doc. You're a beauty.
4893680 4896800 - Coming?<br />- Yeah, I'm coming.
4903200 4906240 Good afternoon, Captain.
4906720 4910560 That's good. See how easy that was?
4913360 4915080 I love it down here. Don't you?
4915320 4920200 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4923040 4925080 Give me the lock-up keys.
4925320 4927800 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
4928040 4932080 They were all busted by the same<br />police officer, Jack Edward Travis.
4932320 4934480 Early paroles<br />on the work-furlough program.
4934720 4937720 Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4937960 4940440 You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4940680 4942320 - May I see your pass?<br />- My pass?
4942560 4943440 Here's my fucking pass.
4943680 4946200 - I got shot in the line of duty.<br />- He's with us.
4946440 4947760 - "He's with us"?<br />- I said that?
4948000 4949240 Where'd you get her from?
4949480 4950960 Why aren't you in the hospital?
4951200 4953560 Don't mention it.<br />I told you not to leave me there.
4953800 4956520 They tried to take my appendix out.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4956760 4958320 - Brain surgery?<br />- A lapotomy.
4958560 4960600 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4960840 4962200 What's the difference?
4962440 4965680 The difference is, for a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4965920 4967200 Nether what?
4967440 4969600 Nether... I can't say it in front of her.
4969840 4971720 Point to it.
4971960 4973120 - Here.<br />- It must be itchy.
4973360 4975760 It is itchy. These doctors are savages.
4976000 4980640 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
4981600 4984080 Yeah. With a telescope big enough<br />to see Venus.
4984320 4986040 I guess all they saw was Uranus.
4986280 4988240 That's great. Thank you.
4988480 4989720 You know what I say?
4989960 4993360 They fuck you in the hospital.<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you!
4993600 4994800 When they're done...
4995040 4997960 ...the insurance company comes<br />and fucks you some more!
4998200 5001200 $10 for a fucking aspirin<br />and it isn't even covered!
5001440 5002400 That's enough!
5002640 5003920 We're trying to work here.
5004160 5006960 So, what's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5007200 5008480 Did you guys advertise?
5008720 5011120 - He's family.<br />- Who's she?
5011360 5013280 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- How are you? Leo Getz.
5013520 5015800 - Anything you need, Leo "gets". Get it?<br />- I get it.
5016040 5017200 It's real estate now...
5017440 5019680 Listen, come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
5019920 5021920 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
5022160 5023600 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5023840 5027280 That's great. I take one for you<br />and that's what you tell me?
5027520 5031200 - He could check this out.<br />- That's all I'm good for?
5031440 5033000 We've got something for you to do.
5033240 5036880 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
5037120 5039480 - Sure, I can do this.<br />- Can you remember that name?
5039720 5041200 Mesa Verde, I got it.
5041440 5045200 - Wait. What are you doing?<br />- If there's any shit there, he'll find it.
5045440 5048760 - Who is that guy?<br />- It's a long story.
5053600 5055560 Here are your keys, Captain.
5055800 5056760 You motherfucker!
5057000 5058760 - Don't be stupid.<br />- What the fuck?
5059000 5063200 Take the elevator, get the other guys.<br />Keys. Give me those fucking hands.
5063440 5067200 Goddamn you, Travis. What the fuck?
5067360 5070600 Stand there.
5072720 5075360 I can get faster results<br />than that real estate broker.
5075600 5077840 Leo's not just a real estate broker.
5078080 5081640 He's a pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5081880 5085200 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator.
5085440 5087800 - How'd you know where to find them?<br />- We got it all.
5088040 5089520 The world of computers.
5089760 5092560 You used to be one of us, for Christ's sake.
5092800 5095800 You know what future a cop has? None.
5096040 5098880 Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
5099120 5100600 Pension.
5100840 5101720 Nothing to do.
5101960 5105160 Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain<br />by evening. Not for this kid.
5105400 5107360 Police Department's got it all:
5107600 5109040 Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.
5109280 5112560 It's a one-stop shopping center<br />if you've got the balls and the brains.
5112800 5114440 Not a thing anybody can do about it.
5114680 5116760 You're already fucking history<br />and you know it.
5117000 5119200 Sorry. I'm just getting started.
5119440 5121280 Something's wrong.
5121520 5124000 The program's been accessed<br />by someone from the outside.
5124240 5125560 What's been accessed?
5125800 5129400 After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs<br />moved the confiscated ammunition.
5129640 5130840 Armor-piercing bullets?
5131080 5133880 Thousands of rounds<br />to a more secure location.
5134120 5136440 - That's what's been accessed.<br />- Someone else knows.
5136680 5139440 Where's this store? Where'd they move it?
5139680 5141040 Let's go.
5141280 5143760 - I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.<br />- That's a switch.
5144000 5145720 - Right here in the building.<br />- Where?
5145960 5147800 - I'm showing you.<br />- Something's going down.
5148040 5150040 - Nothing's going down.<br />- I'm going with you.
5150280 5152440 - How old are you?<br />- Twenty-two today.
5152680 5153520 Come on.
5153760 5155120 Have you got protection?
5155360 5157880 - Right here in my wallet.<br />- No, your vest, you dummy.
5158120 5159400 Should we take him?
5159640 5162400 - Okay, but keep your head down.<br />- Stay behind me.
5162640 5165880 Come on, let's go. Quiet!
5176560 5178360 You were my ticket in.
5178600 5182440 It's too bad you won't be coming with me.
5186160 5188640 They got it all.
5188880 5191080 - He's dead.<br />- How'd they get it out of here?
5191320 5193320 - I don't know.<br />- Not upstairs.
5193560 5196360 Elevator.
5197800 5199080 Shit. It's down.
5199320 5200480 The subway's down there.
5200720 5202640 - Let's take the stairs.<br />- LA has subways?
5202880 5206200 - Where've you been?<br />- Read something besides the comics.
5206440 5209960 All right. Come on, let's hustle!
5211040 5213920 Hurry up, guys.
5225040 5226320 LAPD! Come here!
5226560 5228800 Come here! Step on it!
5229040 5230240 Son of a bitch!
5230480 5232480 Did you see anybody or anything strange?
5232720 5237200 - Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.<br />- Split now. Just get out of here.
5237440 5240560 - I'm going across.<br />- I got it.
5245640 5249000 Get rid of Murphy, now!
5252960 5257160 Where the fuck do you think you're going?<br />Let's go.
5266920 5269880 Let's get out of here.
5269960 5272480 Cover me.
5290720 5293280 Let's go.
5301760 5304640 Stay still.
5312800 5315760 Happy birthday, kid.
5339480 5342280 Another baby.
5353160 5354680 Is he dead? Check the body.
5354920 5357720 Get me out of here!
5360680 5363480 Stupid son of a bitch!
5373680 5374520 Stop that.
5374760 5375600 Cut it out.
5375840 5377400 - Don't shoot.<br />- LAPD!
5377640 5378760 Where does this lead?
5379000 5380320 - Pico Station.<br />- Thanks.
5380560 5381520 Not that way.
5381760 5385280 Take the stairs, it's faster.
5397000 5399560 Gangway!
5405640 5408840 Get out of the way!
5410240 5411600 Holy shit!
5411840 5413360 Son of a bitch!
5413600 5416200 Police!
5421440 5424680 Step on it. There he is.
5425000 5427560 Goddamn!
5431040 5434440 Put your foot down!
5458720 5459920 Police!
5460160 5461120 I need your bike.
5461360 5462760 This is bullshit.
5463000 5467680 Sergeant Riggs, call it in.<br />I need a couple of clips, too.
5481120 5484160 Okay, we lost him.
5489640 5491920 Where's Riggs?
5492160 5496200 Keep me in touch<br />with the motorcycle pursuit.
5501320 5502920 - Shit!<br />- Take a right, now.
5503160 5503920 Take a right.
5504160 5506440 Go!
5508160 5510960 Take a right! No, left!
5549400 5553040 This is 6-William-6.<br />I'm at the freeway construction site.
5553280 5555160 Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?
5555400 5557680 Come back to me, Central.
5557920 5560880 Where the hell is Riggs?
5560880 5562320 Take a left here! Get off!
5562560 5565440 Get off the freeway!
5575240 5577920 Stop! Hold it!
5577960 5579600 Shit!
5579840 5582240 Hang on!
5595600 5598640 Where is the pursuit?
5600960 5603360 Shit!
5616000 5617280 Relax, Riggs.
5617520 5620120 Relax?
5622840 5625400 Shit!
5638040 5640440 Just get back. Get back!
5640680 5643000 Riggs, talk to me.
5643240 5645680 Riggs, you're alive.
5645920 5647320 Don't move.
5647560 5649400 Just get back.
5649640 5652360 Are you all right?
5657440 5658840 Don't touch me!
5659080 5662320 Okay! I'm not touching you!
5662560 5665760 Don't touch me!
5669120 5672960 - Don't touch me.<br />- I won't touch you.
5675880 5678800 - Are you okay now?<br />- I'm pissed. Now I'm pissed.
5679040 5680240 - Now what?<br />- That bastard!
5680480 5682480 He's done this twice now. Damn!
5682720 5685480 Son of a gun,<br />I'll suck his eyes down through his nose.
5685720 5688880 That's twice he's got away.<br />Nobody gets away from me.
5689120 5690680 Just relax.
5690920 5692600 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
5692840 5696200 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm okay.
5699680 5701080 - I'm having that.<br />- You quit!
5701320 5705520 I ran out of biscuits, okay?<br />Give me a break.
5707560 5710080 Oh, shit!
5712960 5715360 Perfect.
5715360 5717200 What'd I miss?
5717440 5719520 - What are you doing here?<br />- Great car chase.
5719760 5721640 - Great chase.<br />- What are you doing here?
5721880 5723600 - How'd you find us?<br />- Police scanner.
5723840 5726640 What are you doing with a police scanner?
5726880 5730200 Hello, Car 54, where are you?<br />I cracked this case for you guys.
5730440 5732080 Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.
5732320 5734560 They got a housing project,<br />called Rancho Arroyo.
5734800 5737080 - I know where that is.<br />- Why don't we check it out?
5737320 5738880 - That's a good idea.<br />- Yeah, okay.
5739120 5740200 I'll come with you.
5740440 5742200 - You're not coming with us.<br />- Yes, I am.
5742440 5743440 I'll take my car.
5743680 5746320 - No, you're not.<br />- Yes, I am.
5746560 5750600 I can't believe you did that! I got a spare!
5752120 5753760 - You're driving.<br />- No, I'm driving.
5754000 5758120 How could you do that?<br />I can't believe you did that.
5758360 5759480 Where's Lorna?
5759720 5763080 I can't believe you did that!
5763840 5764880 I can't believe it.
5765120 5767920 How could you do that to me?
5768160 5769200 Did you see that?
5769440 5772720 They're my partners.<br />I can't believe they did that!
5772960 5775920 Do you own your own home?
5806760 5809240 - Looks like we came to the right place.<br />- Yeah.
5809480 5811320 Move on out to Travis Town.
5811560 5813840 Great place to raise a family.
5814080 5816080 Built on guns and bloodshed.
5816320 5818600 One hell of a retirement plan<br />this asshole's got.
5818840 5821680 Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.
5821920 5824000 - Say, is that...<br />- Darryl's gun.
5824240 5826760 - I've been saving it for the right occasion.<br />- This is it.
5827000 5829200 - How many men do you think he has?<br />- Who knows?
5829440 5831320 Maybe I should run over there<br />and ask him?
5831560 5832720 That'd be too easy.
5832960 5835320 Wish I had some grenades<br />or a rocket launcher.
5835560 5837720 Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
5837960 5841800 I wonder what Murphy's got in his trunk.
5842280 5844880 It's obvious Murphy<br />was never a Boy Scout.
5845120 5848520 Not even a good spare.
5850400 5851760 Put your hands down...
5852000 5854960 ...it's embarrassing.
5855360 5856440 How are you doing?
5856680 5857480 Kissing.
5857720 5858920 Fresh ones?
5859160 5860760 Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.
5861000 5862320 No points for those.
5862560 5865120 - How'd you get here?<br />- Drove.
5865360 5868480 I ran into Leo at the police station.<br />He talked to me first.
5868720 5870800 - Any ideas?<br />- Lucky thing we've got a plan.
5871040 5872400 Lucky thing. What is it?
5872640 5874840 I want it to be a surprise.
5875080 5878080 I like surprises.
5881920 5884640 Move it!
5885440 5888680 - Check it out.<br />- Let's go.
5904240 5907040 - Look what they did to Murph's car.<br />- It could've been worse.
5907280 5910480 - It could've been yours.<br />- Worse, it could've been Trish's car.
5910720 5911880 - On three.<br />- Three.
5912120 5914160 Three?
5914400 5916360 One...
5916600 5917560 ...two...<br />- Three!
5917800 5920320 Police! Freeze!
5920680 5923200 Oh, shit!
5931680 5934880 - Let's go!<br />- Right now!
5940800 5943440 What's wrong with you?<br />I said go on three, not two.
5943680 5944800 On three.
5945040 5946160 It's always three.
5946400 5947960 Boys!
5948200 5952480 What are we doing here?<br />Losing our heads in a crisis?
5954080 5956960 Cover me!
5974240 5976840 Exxon.
5979840 5981360 - What?<br />- Count to 20.
5981600 5982120 What?
5982360 5985920 Count to 20 and then light me.
5988840 5991200 Shit!
5992360 5995680 Riggs, it's loaded with ammo!
6007480 6010520 - Cover me.<br />- Cover you?
6010880 6012120 Cover you, cover Riggs.
6012360 6016160 When's someone gonna cover me<br />for a change?
6019520 6023480 What's that, 13, 14? To hell with it.
6037680 6041560 It's the cops. They're burning everything.
6051200 6052040 Son of a bitch!
6052280 6055320 Crazy motherfucker!
6058040 6058760 Damn!
6059000 6062560 Riggs, the ammo! Get out of there!
6076680 6078760 You crazy son of a bitch!
6079000 6081440 Yeah!
6095360 6099040 Son of a bitch. You're full of shit.
6101520 6102800 Stay there.
6103040 6105920 Shit, where's Riggs?
6118040 6121120 Son of a bitch! No clip.
6121920 6124800 Lorna, no, don't!
6129960 6131640 Come on in, bitch.
6131880 6134440 The door's open!
6156120 6159520 I'm gonna eat your fucking heart!
6184280 6187240 Son of a bitch.
6190840 6193160 Shit!
6205280 6207080 Armor-piercing bullets, yeah.
6207320 6209600 Cop killers.
6209840 6212960 You're coming with me!
6219640 6222440 Fuck you, asshole!
6238840 6240880 Get up!
6241120 6242280 Get up!
6242520 6246480 Killed in the line of duty.
6248320 6252760 You'll get a great funeral<br />from the Department.
6257080 6260120 Cop killers.
6270000 6273040 Ex-cop killers.
6281600 6284280 Go to hell, Riggs.
6284520 6287160 You first.
6295960 6298760 Crazy son of a bitch!
6303000 6306840 Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.
6307640 6309320 Just hold still.
6309560 6311680 Get a chopper, man.
6311920 6314000 She had two vests on.<br />She's gonna be okay.
6314240 6316360 A couple of bad ones.<br />We need to get a chopper.
6316600 6320400 You're all right, partner. Hang on.
6320640 6323440 It's okay. Just lie still.
6323680 6326760 Just a romantic evening by the fire,<br />just the two of us.
6327000 6329600 Just be still.
6337760 6340560 Honey, open your eyes.
6340800 6343520 Open your eyes.
6345760 6347760 What are you trying to prove out there?
6348000 6349680 Why do you do that?
6349920 6353120 - Can I take this off?<br />- Yeah.
6353600 6358880 You're supposed to grow old<br />with someone, not because of them.
6363040 6364880 I'm gonna be with you.
6365120 6367160 I'm with you now. Look, I'm right here.
6367400 6370840 We're both here, right? Right.
6371000 6372760 Come on, I want to be with you.
6373000 6375560 What have you got to lose?
6375800 6378200 You.
6378720 6381440 Not likely.
6385120 6388080 - Hey, Lorna.<br />- Yeah?
6389560 6392920 Let's live to regret this.
6395960 6397520 - We've got to go, sir.<br />- Okay.
6397760 6400640 She's gonna be fine.
6403000 6405520 Can you hear me?
6405760 6408320 I love you.
6423560 6428040 "Happy retirement, Daddy"
6428280 6432240 "Happy retirement, Daddy"
6432480 6435120 This is it. This is the day.
6435360 6436320 Everybody? Daddy?
6436560 6439400 I want you to know there's a candle<br />for every year in the Force.
6439640 6441640 Yes! A lot of years.
6441880 6445560 - You have to blow it out.<br />- Come on.
6446400 6447120 I can't.
6447360 6450000 - Come on, blow it out.<br />- That's not what I mean.
6450240 6451640 What?
6451880 6454600 I can't retire.
6454840 6458000 I thought I could. I wanted to.
6458240 6460800 But I can't.
6463600 6465800 That means you're gonna<br />stay with the Force?
6466040 6469880 That means I'm staying<br />with the Force, baby.
6470840 6475440 This cake's about to explode,<br />so you'd better blow out these candles.
6475680 6478920 I want you to know<br />that I'm behind you all the way.
6479160 6480760 - Me, too.<br />- So am I, Dad.
6481000 6481880 It's okay.
6482120 6486920 Well, the streets will be safer<br />for another couple of years.
6487200 6488520 "Word", Nick?
6488760 6491360 "Word", Dad.
6492760 6494960 Blow them out!
6495200 6496240 Hello?
6496480 6498600 Hello! In here!
6498840 6502080 Hello. I gotta talk to Roger.
6502240 6503440 Oprah should see this.
6503680 6505800 I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.
6506040 6507440 What is it?
6507680 6511120 Where's Riggs? I didn't know<br />he could hold his breath that long.
6511360 6512840 I'm taking a bath, Leo.
6513080 6517080 I can see that. And it's cold water, too.<br />There goes your image.
6517320 6518800 Listen, I got great news.
6519040 6521720 Once again, Leo Getz has delivered.
6521960 6524400 Okay, I have sold this turkey.
6524640 6528800 This termite-infested dump is now gone.<br />Okay?
6529040 6532760 All you have to do is sign the contract<br />before the suckers change their mind.
6533000 6535040 Okay? I did it!
6535280 6536680 The house is off the market.
6536920 6540480 We're gonna stay in this "termite-infested turkey"<br />for another ten years.
6540720 6543600 - At least.<br />- Maybe I'll get married here.
6543840 6545600 - Come on, out.<br />- You can't do this.
6545840 6548400 - Out.<br />- No, you can't do that.
6548640 6551200 You can't do that. I have contracts signed.
6551440 6553600 Because we're partners,<br />no commission. Okay?
6553840 6554520 Partners?
6554760 6556840 You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
6557080 6557840 Why?
6558080 6561080 Because bullets aren't covered<br />in normal road hazard. That's why!
6561320 6563240 I want those tires. No conditions.
6563480 6564760 Leo, get out of here!
6565000 6566960 - Don't tell me to get out!<br />- Out!
6567200 6571400 Okay, I'm going.<br />You're lucky your wife's here.
6573600 6575000 Don't come crying to me if...
6575240 6575920 Get out!
6576160 6580280 - Termites get...<br />- No more!
6581240 6583960 Your friends.
6584320 6588120 Ten more years till forced retirement.
6588160 6592240 That's 3,650 days.
6592480 6595760 - Forty-nine.<br />- Oh, yeah.
6605440 6608840 I gotta improve my image.
6618440 6621240 'Bye, Daddy!
6622240 6624960 'Bye, baby.
6632400 6634440 What are you smiling at?
6634680 6636200 Why weren't you at my party?
6636440 6638000 I knew you weren't going to retire.
6638240 6641880 I've been wrong about a few things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
6642120 6643920 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6644160 6646600 I'm smoking to forget<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6646840 6648440 What dog-biscuit problem?
6648680 6650440 I've been chasing more cars lately...
6650680 6653800 ...and when I try to lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
6654040 6655160 Jesus Christ.
6655400 6656800 I'm driving. Other side.
6657040 6659920 I've got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.
6660160 6661360 Thank you for opening it.
6661600 6664080 An old fella like you<br />needs all the help he can get.
6664320 6665360 I'll show you.
6665600 6668360 - Who's a grumpy bastard?<br />- I'm a grumpy bastard.
6668600 6669880 - You know something?<br />- What?
6670120 6673760 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.
6674000 6677640 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.
6677880 6679680 He did it to me.
6679920 6681960 I know.
6682200 6685000 See what I mean?
6685440 6686720 My point exactly.
6686960 6689840 Son of a bitch!
6691800 6693120 Stay away from my daughter!
6693360 6695600 You can't be serious?<br />What are you talking about?
6695840 6697120 I saw you kiss Rianne.
6697360 6699400 She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6699640 6702440 - That's not the point!<br />- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6702680 6705120 If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
6705360 6708640 - Are you getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />- I'm getting enough fiber!
6708880 6709960 I'm spoken for, okay?
6710200 6712920 I'm gonna pick Lorna up<br />from the hospital this afternoon.
6713160 6714360 We're practically...
6714600 6716880 - You're serious?<br />- We've got a dog and everything.
6717120 6719320 I figure I can make ends meet.

6926080 6927920 We ain't seen nothing yet, Rog.
6928160 6930320 - Get me closer.<br />- It's roped off.
6930560 6933840 - Can't see the bomb squad anywhere.<br />- They're coming.
6934080 6936200 Stop here and I'll just get out.

6945160 6947640 - I hope nobody saw us.<br />- They'll blame us.
6947880 6950960 Let's keep cool. You'd better<br />get your girdle out of mothballs.
6951200 6953360 They'll say, "Back in uniform again."
