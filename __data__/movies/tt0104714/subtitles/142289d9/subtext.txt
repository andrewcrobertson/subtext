291791 294251 I'm thinking that it's<br />eight minutes and 42 seconds.
294418 298004 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, have a cappuccino.
298172 301800 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />It's eight minutes and 31 seconds.
301967 304302 -Rog, please.<br />-Forget the cappuccino.
304470 307806 -You know what they're gonna say?<br />-"Get the fuck out of here."

314688 316940 -How can you be so sure?<br />-Oh, it's just a hunch.
317107 319317 -A hunch?<br />-Remember the bomb under your toilet?
319485 322571 -Oh, shit. How could I forget?<br />-Red wire, blue wire, same thing.

3129167 3133588 Was used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990.

3148353 3151314 Instead, it found its way into the hands<br />of a 15-year-old boy...
3151481 3153733 ...who fired on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3153900 3157236 -Thought it looked familiar.<br />-That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3157403 3161031 ...were stolen from a police storage<br />facility before they could be destroyed.
3161199 3164202 They should be paper clips right now<br />or license plates.
3164369 3167914 Anything but a gun. Here we are,<br />busting our asses on the streets...

3172460 3175004 When you busted Phelps,<br />you stumbled onto something...
3175171 3177256 ...the department's<br />trying to keep a lid on.
3177423 3180801 That's why Internal Affairs is on this.<br />They think it's an inside job.
3180968 3183553 Yeah, that's right.<br />They knew police procedures.
3183721 3185973 They knew where the guns were<br />and how to get in.
3186140 3188433 They knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3188601 3191395 ...because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3191562 3194273 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />-Or an ex-cop.
3194565 3196608 -Right. Travis.<br />-Travis.

3628791 3630501 But I need ammo.
3630668 3632586 I'm out of business without ammo.
3632753 3636840 - I need the good stuff.<br />-You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3638050 3639760 "The good stuff.” Jesus. Pfft!
3639927 3642054 Time to pay another visit to the L.A.P.D.
3642805 3644056 [RIGGS GROANS]

3656235 3659279 Hey. Hey.
3659446 3661656 You got anything I can put on my head?
3661824 3663200 There's a hat in the closet.
3663367 3667867 You're all heart. Here I thought you were<br />gonna get all tender and maternal with me.
3668122 3670541 Listen, Riggs,<br />I was raised with four brothers.
3670708 3671959 We got hurt all the time...
3672126 3675379 ...but if no bones were broken<br />or blood wasn't gushing, nobody cared.
3675546 3677923 -Hey, look, blood. See? Blood.<br />-It's not gushing.
3678090 3680759 Well, it was free-flowing earlier.
3681135 3683095 Could you bring me<br />a needle and thread?
3683262 3686723 You know, maybe some peroxide.<br />I can patch it up myself.
3688767 3691686 -Don't touch anything.<br />- I wasn't. I didn't--
3693439 3695149 What's with you, anyway?
3704074 3706785 [MUSIC PLAYING ON COMPUTER]
3710456 3713500 -The boys.<br />-Hey, what are you doing, huh?
3713667 3716294 - I told you not to touch anything.<br />-Uh, this came on by itself.
3716462 3718714 -Came on all by itself? You a wise guy?<br />- I swear.
3718881 3720799 You don't like to share your toys?
3720966 3722717 -This isn't a toy, Riggs.<br />-What is it?
3722885 3724636 -This is a weapon. Yeah.<br />-A weapon?
3724803 3726805 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3726972 3729265 What, do you throw it at people?<br />Pretty heavy.
3729433 3732144 You're gonna give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3732311 3733312 Right here.
3733479 3735647 -Okay, take a little off the top.<br />-Right here.
3735814 3736981 [RIGGS GRUNTS]
3741820 3744155 -You bring all your interrogations home?<br />-Okay.

3746951 3748327 Careful. Careful.
3748494 3749995 -Careful. Oh.<br />-This?
3750162 3752664 -This scratch?<br />-Come on, it feels like Grand Canyon.
3752831 3754624 -Oh, God.<br />-Ah!
3754792 3756251 -Hold still.<br />-Yeah.
3756418 3760380 -Ah!<br />-Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3760547 3761798 Be gentle with me.
3762549 3765176 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3765344 3769222 Huh? Oh, that's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3769473 3772017 -That's a natural mistake.<br />-What, I have a wooden head?
3772184 3773476 -Look at that.<br />-It's a knife.
3773644 3775771 -Knife? That's very knife.<br />-Mm-hm.
3776063 3777105 This is all right.
3777273 3779692 Oh, that's pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw. Mm-hm.
3779858 3782861 Hey, that's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this, huh?
3783028 3785030 Same damn thing. Third and Highland.
3785197 3788116 -Dragged for about half a block.<br />-That's a good one.
3788284 3790452 Feel that texture. Feel it.<br />Cheese-grater time.
3790619 3792704 -Moving truck.<br />-Moving truck? Ooh!
3792871 3794289 -Moving bullet.<br />-Moving bullet?
3794456 3796207 -Here. This is the best.<br />-Bullets now.
3796959 3799795 -It goes all the way to the back.<br />-Oh, hey. Right through?
3799962 3801546 You're lucky. What is it, .227?
3801714 3803215 -It's a .38, Riggs.<br />-That's a .387
3803382 3806218 -It's a .38.<br />-That's a wimpy .38. This is a .38.
3806385 3809304 -Yours is bigger than mine? Don't think so.<br />- I think so.
3809471 3810722 Maybe not, but look. Watch.
3810889 3814058 A whole family of .44s on the back.
3814226 3816311 -Look, there they are.<br />-impressive.
3816478 3819856 One got stuck in my lung.<br />I was breathing blood bubbles. Disgusting.
3820024 3821316 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3821483 3823359 -You got one?<br />-Mm.
3823527 3825153 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3825446 3826905 -Oh, yeah.<br />-Mm-hm.
3827448 3830159 -Yeah. Right down here. Went through.<br />-Oh.
3830326 3831535 -That must've hurt.<br />-Right.
3831702 3832744 -Not too close.<br />-Pfft!
3832911 3834829 Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
3834997 3837749 I can beat it. I can beat it.<br />Have a look at this.
3837916 3840168 -I'll take your word for it.<br />-You gotta see this.
3840336 3843088 -I'll take your word.<br />-This guy had a knife. You'll love it.
3843255 3845882 He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3846300 3848927 -Hurt like a son of a bitch.<br />-I'll take your word for it.
3849094 3850220 No, I said forget it.
3850387 3853306 -This is a blue-ribbon event.<br />-Forget it, Riggs.
3854391 3855433 Hey, you started this.
3855601 3858270 -Yeah, well, I can end it.<br />-You know what?
3858729 3860105 You're a very poor loser.
3861565 3862774 I didn't lose, Riggs.
3862941 3864692 -Yes, you did.<br />-No. No, I didn't lose.
3864860 3866444 -You lost.<br />- I conceded.
3866612 3869031 There's a difference between<br />losing and conceding.
3869198 3870866 You conceded or you're conceited?
3871033 3873118 -You think I'm conceited?<br />-Oh, yeah.
3873285 3875453 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3875621 3876663 I'll get a Band-Aid.
3876830 3879958 -Tell me you lost.<br />- I said, don't touch anything.
3891678 3894222 You're gonna smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
3895099 3897017 I can do better than that, Riggs.
3898143 3900186 [RIGGS GRUNTS]
3912866 3913950 [GASPS]
3914118 3917496 This could be<br />a serious ethical breach here.
3917788 3919956 I never made it<br />with another sergeant before.

3989651 3992278 Well, uh, you're doing pretty well.<br />Trish didn't send me.
3992446 3994990 Rianne came to see me.<br />She asked me to find you.
3995157 3997742 -Your place?<br />-Well, that's where I am.

4016845 4018263 -No.<br />-Give me that.
4018430 4020265 Rog, please don't do this, okay?
4020432 4023768 You got three days until you retire.<br />This is not gonna do you any good.

4697650 4699109 Hey, Murphy.

4709954 4712039 -What, do you eat alone?<br />-I'm used to it.
4712207 4713458 It's bad for the digestion.

4721466 4723301 The fuck is this?
4723468 4725219 Hey, buddy, you all right?

4728765 4732351 -Jack, what the fuck?<br />-Get in the car. I'll tell you after the ride.
4738942 4741611 MURTAUGH: After watching Lorna<br />handle herself so well...
4741778 4744197 ...boy, I'm changing my mind<br />about all that kung fu.
4744364 4745948 Hey you wanna try something?
4746324 4748075 -No. No, no, no.<br />-Come on.
4748243 4750245 Guess you can't teach<br />an old dog new tricks.
4750411 4752955 -Hey, hey, hey. Old dog, my ass, huh?<br />-Yeah?
4753122 4757000 You wanna try something? Watch this.<br />This is called a backspin kick.
4757168 4758836 Pivot right, kick with your left...
4759003 4762131 ...and you whip that head around<br />to catch the target over there.
4762298 4764174 Get that head round and follow through.
4764342 4767345 Like so. So you whip the head.
4768805 4770348 All right?

4785446 4788115 Just back up a little bit.<br />A little bit more. Okay, good.

4804173 4805924 Okay, okay, back to work, everybody.
4806092 4809386 Man. Oh, Rog, man, I'm sorry.
4810888 4812681 Sergeant Murtaugh.
4812849 4817349 You could be experiencing some<br />transitional anger caused by the shooting.
4818021 4820273 You wanna talk about it?
4820940 4823359 - I think he's okay for a change, doc.<br />-Are you sure?
4823526 4827154 Yeah. You know, you really look good<br />in red. That's your color, I think.
4827530 4831367 -I've got a little extra time now, sergeant.<br />-I'm fine, doctor.
4836414 4837415 Oh, shit.
4837874 4839709 Where's Sergeant Murtaugh?
4839959 4842544 -What?<br />-No, her.
4842879 4846048 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the good-looking Sergeant Murtaugh?
4846466 4848551 -Aah!<br />DELORES: Hi, skinny.
4848718 4850928 -Delores. You remember me?<br />RIGGS: I remember you.
4851095 4854264 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
4854432 4858269 As a matter of fact, he's cowering down<br />on all fours right behind this counter.
4858978 4860688 [GIGGLES]
4860855 4864024 -Listen, where's the sergeant?<br />-He's not here at the moment, Delores.
4864192 4866611 But, uh, he's talked of nothing<br />but you all week.
4866778 4868613 DELORES: Shut my mouth.<br />-The man's on fire.
4868780 4870823 -What's the matter, baby?<br />-A little sciatica.
4870990 4874201 Oh. You tell him Delores was here.
4874369 4876245 You tell that man...
4876412 4878455 ...that he's the jam in my jelly roll.
4878623 4879665 [BOTH LAUGH]
4879832 4883210 -I'll see you, baby, okay? Bye-bye.<br />-Okay. Bye.
4884212 4885296 [CLEARS THROAT]
4885463 4888340 Delores says that you're<br />the jam in her jelly roll. That's--
4888508 4890343 -I heard.<br />-Heh.
4890510 4892428 -That's a lot of woman there.<br />-Shit.
4892595 4896307 She calls me all the time. And she leaves<br />me notes. What am I gonna do?
4896474 4899977 -You shouldn't have led her on.<br />-Led her on? I didn't do anything, Riggs.
4900144 4904148 I mean, if Trish finds out about it--<br />I didn't-- I didn't--
4904482 4907151 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4907318 4909945 You've gotta come see me.
4910113 4912365 Well, we gotta work. Come on. Let's go.
4912532 4915451 -Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />-Yeah. Thanks, doc.
4915701 4916952 -You're a beauty.<br />RIGGS: Coming?
4917120 4918996 A beauty. Yeah, I'm coming.
4926587 4928505 Afternoon, captain.
4930174 4933302 JACK: That's good, Murphy.<br />See how easy that was?
4937306 4939057 I love it down here, don't you, Murph?
4939225 4943479 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4947191 4949026 MURPHY:<br />Give me the lock-up keys.
4949569 4952363 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
4952530 4954532 And all busted by<br />the same police officer...
4954699 4956784 ...Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
4956951 4958702 Early paroles<br />on the work furlough program.
4958870 4962373 Uh-huh. Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4962540 4965292 Just a minute. You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4965460 4966711 -What?<br />-May I see your pass?
4966878 4968671 -Wanna see? Here's my pass.<br />- I do.
4968838 4971423 - I got shot in the line of duty, okay?<br />-He's with us.
4971591 4973134 -He's with us?<br />-Did I say that?
4973301 4976554 -Where'd you get her from?<br />-What are you doing out of the hospital?
4976721 4979223 Don't mention the hospital.<br />I told you not to leave me.
4979390 4981975 They tried to take my appendix.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4982143 4984103 -Brain surgery?<br />-No, a lapotomy.
4984270 4986563 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4986731 4987773 What's the difference?
4987940 4992027 The difference is, when you get a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4992195 4995364 -Nether what?<br />-Your nether-- I can't say it in front of her.
4995531 4996990 Well, point to it.
4997241 4998283 [SCOFFS]
4998451 4999743 -Okay. Here.<br />-Must be itchy.
4999911 5002330 Yes, it is itchy.<br />These doctors are savages.
5002497 5005583 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
5005750 5007251 Huh? Huh?
5007418 5008460 [SCOFFFS]
5008628 5011088 Yeah. With a telescope<br />big enough to see Venus.
5011255 5012923 I guess all they saw was Uranus, huh?
5013090 5015258 Oh, that's great. Huh-huh.<br />That's great. Thank you.
5015426 5016844 -You know what I say?<br />-What?
5017011 5020764 They fuck you in the hospital!<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you.
5020932 5022141 And when they're done...
5022308 5025394 ...along comes the insurance company,<br />and fucks you some more.
5025561 5028605 Ten dollars for a fucking aspirin,<br />that's not even covered.
5028773 5030065 -Leo!<br />-That's enough.
5030233 5031776 -We're trying to work here.<br />-Okay.
5031943 5034779 What's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5034946 5036530 You take an ad out in the paper?
5036697 5039282 -He's family. We gotta go somewhere else.<br />-Who's she?
5039450 5041577 -Sergeant Cole.<br />-Hey, how are you? Leo Getz.
5041744 5043454 Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?
5043621 5045581 - I get it.<br />-Real estate right now but...
5045748 5048083 Hey, listen. Come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
5048251 5050419 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
5050586 5052170 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5052338 5055632 That's great. I take one for you,<br />and that's what you tell me?
5055800 5059136 -He could check this out.<br />-That's all I'm good for? Takes slugs--
5059303 5061930 Leo, Leo, Leo. Look.<br />We got something for you to do.
5062098 5065601 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
5065768 5068479 -Okay. Sure, I can do this.<br />-Remember that name?
5068646 5070481 Right around-- Mesa Verde, I got it.
5070648 5072983 What are you doing giving him<br />Mesa Verde?
5073150 5074985 If there's shit there, he'll dig it up.
5075152 5077028 -Who is that guy?<br />RIGGS: It's a long story.
5083327 5084745 Here are your keys, captain.
5084912 5085996 [SILENCED GUNSHOT]
5086163 5087873 -You motherfucker.<br />-Don't be stupid.

5090793 5092586 Keys. Give me your fucking hands.
5093588 5097133 Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.
5097800 5099885 Stand there.
5103306 5105808 I can get faster results<br />than that real-estate broker.
5105975 5108727 Leo's not just a real-estate broker.
5108894 5111771 Yeah, he's a royal pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5112815 5116401 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator, guys.

6647807 6651352 -Partners?<br />-You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
6651519 6652561 MURTAUGH: Why?<br />-Why?

6735853 6739606 I've been wrong about a couple things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
6739774 6741942 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6742109 6744736 I'm smoking to take my mind off<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6744904 6747948 -What dog-biscuit problem?<br />-I've been chasing more cars lately...
6748115 6751159 ...and, uh, when I try and lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
6751661 6755456 Jesus Christ. Hey, hey, hey.<br />I'm driving. Other side.
6755623 6758542 I got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.

6767301 6768844 -You know something, Riggs?<br />-What?
6769011 6772764 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.

6793411 6795704 RIGGS: You can't be serious.<br />What are you talking about?

6797873 6799708 RIGGS:<br />She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6799875 6802836 MURTAUGH: That's not the point.<br />RIGGS: It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6803004 6805631 MURTAUGH: If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
