103386 104678 Riggs, Homicide.
104846 105430 Nobody's dead.
105597 107698 Hey, the night's young.<br />This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
107866 109408 - Threat or scare?<br />- The real thing.
109576 110993 This gentleman saw the device.
111161 114288 On Level 1, near the gas pumps.<br />I wrote the license plate down.
114456 116123 That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
116291 118417 - Have you evacuated the building?<br />- It's clean.
118585 120002 - Bomb squad?<br />- On their way.
120170 122338 - It's under control. Let's go.<br />- Bomb squad?
122505 124381 Rog, I think we ought to check this out.
124549 127009 - Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />- What?
127385 129511 - Bomb squad's on their way.<br />- There's no bomb.
129679 132139 - How can you be sure?<br />- Because it's a full moon.
132307 134516 Moon, lunar, lunatics.<br />They're everywhere.
134684 136352 - Hey, is that Greek?<br />- No, no. Latin.
136519 138687 Latin. Man, you surprise<br />the shit out of me.
138855 141065 There's no bomb.<br />It's probably a false alarm.
141232 143525 It happens. Probably saw<br />a radio on the back seat.
143693 146445 Hey, hey. Let's not mess with this.<br />Wait for the bomb squad.
146613 148822 You're right.<br />You sit tight, I'll be right back.
148990 151575 - Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />- What's the matter with you?
151743 153994 - There's a bomb in that building.<br />- There's not.
154162 155788 - There's a bomb!<br />- There is not.
155956 158457 There's a bomb in that building!<br />Know how come I know?
158625 160501 - How?<br />- I got eight days to retirement.
160669 162503 And I will not make a stupid mistake.
162671 163754 There is no bomb.
163922 167716 I will bet vital parts of my anatomy<br />to the fact. Now, look. Look.
167884 170260 Trust me. Okay? Trust me.
173765 176058 That's usually my first mistake.
176726 178185 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Yo.
178353 179895 Hey, wait. I'm coming.
180063 181397 - Hey, Rog?<br />- Yeah?
181564 184108 - Your insurance paid up?<br />- Yeah, of course. Why?
184567 188195 - There could be a bomb in here.<br />- Oh, God.
190073 191115 I hate it when I'm right.
192492 195744 - You ought to learn to trust your instincts.<br />- Oh, God.
195912 198539 First impression<br />can often be the right one.
199874 203335 Leak in his diff. About to drop his<br />drive shaft. No wonder there's a bomb.
203503 205295 Just don't touch it.
206631 208090 Just looking.
209300 210884 Right.
213430 217099 What are you gonna do?<br />Don't open the door. Don't open the door!
221271 222771 Son of a bitch, just look at it.
222939 225774 - Just look at it.<br />- That's all I'm gonna do, is look.
228528 230863 Oh, my. There's more plastic than Cher.
231156 234616 I love this job. This is amateur night.<br />Open the door. I can't hear you.
235035 236618 Open the door.
236995 238328 Don't do nothing.
239622 241248 Not that one! Mm-mm!
241416 242708 You son of a bitch.
242876 246045 Well, this is a pretty shonky job.<br />I can dismantle it.
246212 248881 It looks like Beirut to me.<br />Let's get the hell out of here.
252635 255804 Everybody's outside. Just me, you<br />and this cat are dumb enough to be here.
255972 258223 Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh? Heh.
259184 262186 - Relax, Rog. Relax. Right.<br />- Don't do nothing.
262353 264313 We got nine minutes<br />and seven seconds left.
264481 265981 - Know what we could do?<br />- What?
266149 269026 - We could drive this out.<br />- Fine, it's your turn to drive.
269194 271070 No keys. Tsk, tsk. I could hot-wire it.
271237 274490 Aah! Don't even say "hot-wire"<br />around this stuff, man.
274657 277743 - You're right, you're right.<br />- Why am I doing this? Why am I...?
277911 280913 Looks like we're gonna have to do it<br />the old-fashioned way.
281081 285501 Riggs, what are you thinking?<br />What are you thinking, Riggs? Riggs.
285668 287920 - I'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.<br />- Wait!
288088 290005 - That's not what I think.<br />- You think red?
290173 291423 No. No.
291591 294051 I'm thinking that it's<br />eight minutes and 42 seconds.
294219 297805 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, have a cappuccino.
297972 301600 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />It's eight minutes and 31 seconds.
301768 304103 - Rog, please.<br />- Forget the cappuccino.
304270 307606 - You know what they're gonna say?<br />- "Get the fuck out of here. "
307774 311568 After that, they're gonna say, "Cut the<br />blue wire," which I'm gonna do right now.
312112 314321 - Hey, hey. Wait, wait. Riggs. Wait.<br />- What?
314489 316740 - How can you be so sure?<br />- Oh, it's just a hunch.
316908 319118 - A hunch?<br />- Remember the bomb under your toilet?
319285 322371 - Oh, shit. How could I forget?<br />- Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
322539 325749 This is more simplified.<br />A bit more powerful, but more simplified.
325917 329294 - From where I was sitting, I couldn't see.<br />- Forget it. Come on, trust me.
329462 330712 Yeah, so I gotta trust you?
330880 333632 Guess not.<br />Well, I'm cutting the red wire, okay?
333800 335968 Oh! Oh!
336136 339555 - What? What?<br />- A minute ago you said blue.
340390 342808 - Did I say blue?<br />- Riggs, you said blue.
343309 344726 - Well, I meant red.<br />- You sure?
345061 346770 We can do it your way if you'd like.
346938 349064 - My way? I don't have...!<br />- Quiet!
349232 352568 - I'm sure, okay?<br />- Shit.
354529 356363 You ready?
356531 358240 - Rog?<br />- What?
358741 361952 Won't you kind of miss all this good stuff<br />when you retire?
362120 364913 Aren't you gonna miss it a little bit? Huh?
366958 368375 I'm cutting the wire.
369169 370210 Snip. See? All done.
372839 374715 - Rog.<br />- Yeah?
375925 378510 - Grab the cat.<br />- Grab the cat?
378678 381597 Get back! Take cover!
441532 442991 Where are they?
448456 449873 Bravo.
454837 456171 Oops.
457715 459383 Right. Oops.
461844 463720 Right.
468726 471728 Seven days to retirement,<br />I'm busted down to patrolman.
471896 474356 I should've cut the red wire.
474524 476608 - You did.<br />- No, I didn't. I cut the blue wire.
476776 479861 That's what I meant.<br />We should've waited for the bomb squad.
480029 481697 Am I gonna have to listen to this?
481864 484408 - Every day until I retire.<br />- That'll be a week too long.
484575 485867 Ah, shit.
486035 488287 - My feet are killing me.<br />- They're killing me too.
488454 490872 - How?<br />- I gotta listen to you bitch about them!
491040 495419 - Because you should've cut the red wire!<br />- I did cut the red wire!
495962 499172 What's this? It's kind of soft.<br />It's not a bulletproof vest.
499340 502217 - It's not gonna keep anything out.<br />- Gonna keep my stomach in.
502593 504553 What do you got under there?
505054 507472 - It's a girdle.<br />- What?
507974 509933 Oh, God. It's a girdle.
510893 512019 Trish know about this?
512186 513979 Not a woman's girdle, a man's girdle.
514147 516690 - They make girdles for men?<br />- They make girdles for men.
516858 518191 - They do, huh?<br />- Yeah, they do.
518359 521570 I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.<br />Cleaners must have shrunk it.
521738 523280 Well, you should take it to Chin.
523448 526491 I did take it to Chin over in Alpine.<br />Look at it. It's shrunk all up in here.
528286 530245 - Have to hold my breath.<br />- Did you see that?
530413 532748 - See what?<br />- Jaywalker.
533499 534624 Jaywalking?
535126 537252 Hold it right there, pal.<br />Step up here, please.
537420 538754 - Me?<br />- Yes, you.
538921 540505 - What did I do?<br />- Stand there.
540673 543633 What'd you do? Jaywalking.<br />I saw you. I have to cite you.
543801 545844 Jaywalking? Oh, Jesus, come on.
546012 548263 Can you handle this<br />or should I radio for backup?
548431 550932 - Got the ticket book?<br />- People are committing crimes...
551100 553435 - ... and you're hassling me?<br />- Shut up!
553603 554644 Yeah.
556522 557564 Oh!
557732 561318 - Do you know how to fill one of these out?<br />- A long time ago. Let me see.
561486 563278 Can't read it. The print is little.
563446 565197 - Without my glasses.<br />- You're no help.
565365 568617 Can we speed this up? You may<br />have nothing to do. I have things to do.
568785 571661 No, we can't, so will you shut up?
571829 573955 - Jaywalking.<br />- Ask for his license.
574123 575999 - License for jaywalking?<br />- Yeah, jaywalking.
576167 578960 I don't have it on me, okay?<br />I wasn't driving, okay?
579128 581254 I was walking.<br />What, do I need a walking license now?
581422 583882 - Oh, let's just shoot him.<br />- Oh, oh, oh, what is he crazy?
584050 587052 I'm gonna drill him.<br />We can make it look like suicide.
587220 590097 - Get out of the way!<br />- No, no, no. The video cameras.
590264 591723 I don't care! I'm gonna drill him!
591891 595227 Get out of here, before my partner kills you!<br />Go that way, not that way!
595395 596436 This way! Over there!
596604 599398 - Go, run! Now! Run!<br />- Right there, yeah.
607240 609366 Hey. Hey!
609826 613495 Hey, wait a minute.<br />You forgot to sign.
614080 617416 - Hey.<br />- What's that?
618000 620502 - Wait a minute.<br />- You forgot to sign the form.
620670 623422 Hey, who are you?<br />You're not the regular guy.
623589 625757 - He's on vacation.<br />- On vacation?
625925 627801 Well, who the hell is that?
628761 630011 Get in the truck! Get!
637562 639187 You fucking prick!
643443 645026 - Riggs! Riggs!<br />- Are you all right?
646946 648321 - Hey, are you a cop?<br />- Yeah.
648531 651658 Fourteen-sixty. Into pursuit.<br />Will continue transmission.
651826 652993 Call 911.
653161 656246 All right, honey.<br />Let me drive. We're in pursuit.
656414 658665 I'm driving, baby! Don't worry.
665256 668300 This fool picked the wrong time<br />to mess with the wrong lady.
668468 669759 All right. Just stay close.
676434 679853 Hey, hey, hey. Right behind you, baby.<br />That's right. Take a good look.
680021 682856 Delores the Road Warrior<br />is dead on your raggedy ass.
691949 693074 Ram him! Ram him!
699749 701208 - Watch out, Riggs.<br />- Come on!
710384 713094 - Are you married, sugar?<br />- What? Yeah, 24 years.
713262 715722 - Yeah, 24 years.<br />- Yeah, but is it working?
721437 723939 - Hey, you can't get closer?<br />- I am. I'm getting closer.
726609 728777 Hold on, Riggs! Hold on!
737745 740330 - Hey, hey!<br />- Hold on! Hold on! We got you.
740498 741915 Hold on!
742792 744668 - I told you I could do it.<br />- Closer!
744835 746628 - Get me up there.<br />- Yeah, get up close.
746796 748255 I am. I am, all right?
753594 754803 - Back off, back off!<br />- Aah!
767233 770819 - If he falls, don't hit him.<br />- Don't worry. I got something for you.
807857 808857 Whoa!
809025 812360 Ooh, hoo-hoo! Thanks for the interest,<br />sugar, but one thing at a time.
827084 828918 - Catch him, catch him.<br />- All right.
831547 833381 Keep singing, baby. Just stay close.
840723 841723 Relax, baby. Relax, baby.
841891 844643 Ho! Ho! Ho!<br />Hey, keep your hands off my thigh.
844810 847395 - My partner's in trouble. Watch out for him.<br />- I got him!
860576 864579 - Boy, I'm getting too old for this shit.<br />- Not for me, you're not, sugar.
867667 870251 You have the right<br />to remain unconscious.
870628 872087 Anything you say ain't gonna be much.
877426 879010 - Hey, Riggs. You all right?<br />- Ha!
879178 883098 I'm okay. I think we gotta book this guy<br />for not wearing his seat belt though.
883265 885266 Hey, that was dynamite driving.
885434 888978 - No, she's the dynamite driver.<br />- I'll show you dynamite.
889146 892273 - Whoo!<br />- Sure enough. Whoo!
892692 896194 - What have you two been up to?<br />- What do you mean? We were in pursuit.
896362 898655 - I saw you kiss her.<br />- No, I didn't. She kissed me.
898823 902826 It looked mutual. Wipe that lipstick off<br />before the guys at the station start talking.
902993 904494 Hey, go spit, Riggs.
905955 908289 You okay? You all right?
909625 911251 Back to bed. Back to bed.
911585 913962 - Morning, guys. Daddy.<br />- Hey.
914130 917173 Hey, how about treating your dad<br />to breakfast today, okay?
918134 921428 - You got six more days to go.<br />- Laundry service.
922638 924180 Hold this. Hangers?
924348 927851 I'm springing for the soap.<br />Nothing too fancy. That's a cute dog.
928018 929769 - It's a Westie.<br />- Morning. Westie?
929937 931563 - Morning, Trish.<br />- Hey.
931731 933356 Morning, Rog.
934150 935316 - Hey, Nick.<br />- Spare me.
935484 938153 - What? Didn't you brush your teeth?<br />- Hold it, mister.
938320 940321 I'm just looking for some orange juice.
940489 943867 Don't get fingerprints on the door,<br />and put the glass in the dishwasher.
944034 947495 - Did somebody commit a murder?<br />- Somebody's coming to see the house.
947663 949873 Oh. Hey, I think a little mess<br />adds to the charm.
960634 962343 How's this, huh?
962553 964512 This great? Okay? Okay?
965848 967140 Kelly's Pool Hall. Kelly speaking.
967308 970226 Yeah, right, Kelly.<br />Hi, let me speak to Dad.
970394 973646 Oh, hi, honey. How are you?<br />I thought I asked you not to call me here.
974231 976900 - It's for you, Rog.<br />- Me?
977234 978526 Hmm?
978861 980528 Uh, who are...? Who is it? Hello?
980696 982697 Hi. It's my first day at work.

984533 985533 Beautiful, huh?
985701 987994 - Come on, come on, check it out.<br />- Beautiful lawn.
988162 989454 It's great.
989622 991790 See how quiet it is here? Listen, listen.
991957 993124 That great? Come on.
993292 995627 - Very quiet.<br />- The inside's better than the outside.
995795 998546 - It's the people to look at the house.<br />- And our broker.
1001467 1003676 Okay, okay. Just wanna make sure.
1003844 1007138 I gotta show you this room first.<br />This is my favorite. This is great.

1013604 1014646 Shh. Shh. Shh.
1014814 1017524 - You do? It's been completely replaced.<br />- Oh, why was that?
1017691 1020652 A drug dealer came through with his car<br />and crashed right in.
1020820 1022529 Shot up the whole place. Shh.
1022696 1024906 Son of a bitch.<br />I'm gonna cut him off at the...
1025074 1026866 - Ha, ha! Leo.<br />- Oh, ha. Drug dealer.
1027034 1029327 It's true. Hey, it's true. True.
1029495 1032664 Okay, anyway, look. Like the drapes?<br />Maybe she'll leave the drapes.
1032832 1034707 - Hey, I thought you quit, huh?<br />- I did.
1034875 1037502 - You'll stink up the house. Don't smoke.<br />- I'm edgy.
1037670 1041047 - You're edgy? Here.<br />- That stuff about the drug dealer...
1041215 1042423 Chew on these.
1042591 1044676 Listen, I have to tell you<br />these things, okay?
1044844 1046928 It's the law. It's called full disclosure.
1047096 1049389 Anything else you wanna disclose<br />before we go on?
1050891 1054018 Okay, now that you mention it, the<br />bathroom has been completely remodeled...
1054186 1055728 ...due to unexpected bomb damage.
1055896 1057772 Hey, hey, hey, come on. It's okay.
1057940 1059816 - Son of a bitch. I'm gonna...<br />Shh. Shh.
1059984 1062026 - Don't. You'll never sell...<br />Shh.
1067074 1069284 Okay, okay.<br />So, uh, we saw enough of the kitchen.
1069451 1072453 Let me show you upstairs.<br />Wait till you see this. It's beautiful.
1072621 1074122 You're really gonna love this.
1078627 1081296 - They're gone.<br />- Leo Getz, I guess I'm gonna kill him.
1081463 1083882 Son of a bitch. I'm gonna kill him!<br />I'm gonna kill him!
1084049 1086551 Don't...<br />He's trying to ruin me, Riggs.
1087094 1089929 - Hey, Leo, you got...<br />- They weren't gonna buy the house!
1090097 1093558 - Yeah, you scared them away.<br />- No, they couldn't afford the financing.
1093726 1095894 - Oh, Jesus.<br />- Okay, relax.
1096061 1099397 I had to tell them everything.<br />It's the law, okay? I mean, full disclosure.
1099565 1101608 - You must have heard of it.<br />- I'm a cop. I'm the law.
1101775 1102817 - Ah!<br />- Ow!
1102985 1105862 - Get off me! What is it with you?<br />- Hold it.
1107156 1108197 Okay, okay.
1108365 1111034 At least he didn't tell them<br />about that nail-gun incident.
1111201 1113328 - Oh...<br />- I forgot.
1113495 1115914 Did you have a permit<br />when you built over the garage?
1116081 1118041 - Permit?<br />- You know what I'll do? Hold it.
1118208 1120919 Leo's here. I'll take care of it.<br />I'll make a couple calls.
1121086 1122754 We'll get some back-dated permits.
1122922 1125089 - Which phone can I use?<br />- Uh, sunroom. Sunroom.
1125257 1127842 - Okay, okay, okay. I got you.<br />- Jesus Christ.
1128010 1130678 - It's gotta be easier than this.<br />- They don't know Leo Getz.
1130846 1133723 You could do with less aggravation.<br />Come to work with me.
1133891 1137060 Yeah. Thank you, Leo. Son of a bitch.
1137227 1139520 Stop fronting yourself.<br />You know what I'm saying?
1139688 1141648 Swing with me and my crew.<br />That's the move.
1146779 1148696 Forget school.
1150783 1153242 Oh, man. Here comes your pops, man.
1153535 1155411 - Later, man.<br />- All right, I gotcha.
1155579 1158373 - All right, bro. I'm out, man.<br />- Next time, G. Peace, bro.
1161293 1163169 - Morning, Rog.<br />- How you doing?
1163337 1165463 - How you doing, Mr. Fisher?<br />- Hey, Nick.
1165631 1167382 Hey, Nick.
1167549 1170176 - Uh, wasn't that Darryl?<br />- Yeah.
1170344 1172220 Haven't seen him around in a while.
1173305 1176724 - He dropped out of school.<br />- Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.
1176892 1178393 Yeah, I know.
1179728 1180853 Hey, Nick.
1181897 1184232 - Yeah, Dad.<br />- Be good.
1185109 1186609 Word.
1188445 1190071 Hey, word, Nick.
1190447 1191906 Word.
1194868 1197578 - Word, Riggs.<br />- Word, Rog.
1198247 1199789 - What are we talking about?<br />- Word.
1199957 1202250 Starts with a W,<br />"or" in the middle, D on the end.
1202418 1204502 - Word. Oh, yeah, that word.<br />- Where you been?
1204670 1207088 - Word.<br />- Word.
1220394 1223438 - Hey, Tyrone, my man, how are you?<br />- Jack, how's it going?
1223605 1225690 - Let's take a walk.<br />- Hey, wait here for me.
1225858 1228609 Look around. This is my dream<br />and it's all coming true.
1228777 1232530 You sank your money into this, out here<br />in the middle of the fucking desert?
1232698 1234949 That's right.<br />Know why it's gonna be a gold mine?
1235117 1236159 Do tell me.
1236326 1239829 Because nobody wants to live next door<br />to people like you. You're a menace.
1239997 1243249 Jack, I came out here to do business,<br />not be insulted by you.
1243417 1244751 Relax, Tyrone.
1244918 1247420 Just like houses,<br />friendships need strong foundations.
1247588 1250965 Hey, Smitty, come here. Come here.
1252885 1256137 What's wrong with you? Don't I<br />pay you good? Don't I take care of you?
1256305 1257305 Sure you do, Jack.
1257473 1260058 What's this stupid business<br />you and Billy tried to pull?
1260225 1263603 - It was a good plan. It worked.<br />- It worked? It didn't work.
1263771 1265146 You got nailed first time out.
1265314 1267982 Nobody who works for me<br />goes into business for themselves.
1268150 1269442 Understand what I'm saying?
1269610 1271819 See how that can jeopardize everything?<br />Right, Tyrone?
1271987 1273404 Heh, heh, whatever.
1273572 1275990 Especially trying to pop an armored car.
1276575 1280078 Okay, Billy got caught.<br />There's nothing I can do about that now.
1280245 1282872 He's gonna have to face the music<br />on his own.
1283165 1286292 But you and me, Smitty,<br />we're gonna start over.
1286460 1288211 You know what I mean?
1289171 1291005 - Whatever you say, Jack.<br />- Good.
1291173 1293174 Glad you understand<br />what I'm talking about.
1299973 1302183 Now we got a relationship<br />we can build on.
1304520 1307688 - Employee problems. You know how it is?<br />- Yeah, right.
1307856 1310775 You invest time and energy<br />into training somebody.
1310943 1314153 They get greedy and do something stupid<br />that jeopardizes everything.
1314404 1315613 It's a bitch.
1316031 1317949 Stick around. This is the good part.
1318367 1321661 We can put our initials in there. Yeah?
1321829 1323538 Jesus Christ.
1326917 1329127 - Lankershim and Vineland.<br />- Where are we going, Rog?
1329294 1333548 Uh, right here. Rianne's got<br />a new job. I promised her I'd stop by.
1333715 1335258 That's a good reason.
1336093 1338928 All right. Here we are.
1344810 1348104 - You got any silver, any change?<br />- We're cops.
1348272 1351149 That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.<br />I'll get change.
1360993 1364078 - Where are you going? Get down!<br />- Get down! All of you, get down!
1377926 1380136 Riggs! Riggs!
1385309 1388269 How do you like that, huh?<br />What are you doing with a rubber gun?
1388437 1390813 - No! This is a film. There are not...<br />- What?
1390981 1394025 Cut, cut, cut!<br />Who the fuck is this lunatic?
1394193 1396485 - Get him off my set.<br />- This isn't part of the story.
1396653 1398946 - Can we get a cop?<br />- Where did you come from?
1399114 1400448 Jesus. Who are you?
1400616 1403743 Rianne, I'm so sorry.<br />I feel like a microbe right now.
1403911 1406204 - You really thought I was in trouble?<br />- Oh, I did.
1406371 1409207 - You did?<br />- A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.
1409374 1411250 What is wrong with you?<br />Are you an idiot?
1411418 1412460 I apologize.
1412628 1416422 - He's a friend of mine, a policeman.<br />- Yeah, we're both here to visit...
1416590 1417840 Oh, he's a friend of yours?
1418008 1421802 Let me tell you something, okay?<br />You're fired. All right. Have a nice day.
1421970 1423804 Fired? Riggs, what did you do?
1424640 1428434 - You're not fired. Don't worry.<br />- No, you're not. Take it easy, Riggs.
1428602 1430436 You can't fire her for something I did.
1430604 1432772 I don't care whose mistake it was.<br />She's fired.
1432940 1435650 - I apologize to everybody.<br />- Don't push him.
1435817 1437151 - Don't push.<br />- All of you, go!
1437319 1439445 Just take it easy.<br />Don't push him. Don't push.
1439613 1442490 - Get off my set, all right?<br />- What are you, deaf? Go.
1442658 1443866 Move. Get off my set.
1444034 1446160 On any normal day,<br />I'd smack you in the mouth.
1446328 1448246 - Is that so?<br />- Don't hit him.
1448413 1449705 It's a normal day.
1450958 1453209 I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay?<br />I'm sorry.
1453377 1456587 God, I'm all thumbs. Look, he fell down.<br />Let me help you up.
1456755 1458297 I said don't hit him, Riggs.
1458465 1460341 - Is she fired?<br />- Yes, she's fired.
1460509 1461592 - Is she fired?<br />- No.
1461760 1463594 - She got a raise?<br />- It's all right.
1463762 1465680 - Yes. I said yes. Thank you.<br />- Good.
1465847 1469850 - Rianne, I think you have a new friend here.<br />- Yeah.
1470185 1471769 We'd like you to come back.
1473480 1474855 All right.
1476817 1478943 You can't settle every problem<br />with your fists.
1479111 1481904 - I couldn't use my gun. There was a crowd.<br />- Okay, six more days.
1482072 1483864 Look, I don't wanna hear that anymore.
1484032 1487201 Hey, did Rianne get her job back?<br />Did she get a raise? Did she?
1487369 1489161 I don't hear a "thank you. "
1489329 1492790 Maybe I should, uh, become one of those<br />Hollywood agents. What do you think?
1492958 1495418 - Hmm. Won't work.<br />- Why?
1495585 1499839 - You gotta have killer instinct.<br />- Heh. Son of a bitch.
1500048 1503926 - We should've put the bag on the meter.<br />- Put it in the glove compartment.
1504094 1507054 - No, no. I don't do that anymore.<br />- Oh, yeah? Good man.
1507222 1509557 No, it's full up already.<br />Put it in the back seat.
1513645 1516772 - You really like those things, huh?<br />- What, these? Yeah, it's good.
1519568 1522862 Hey, you know, you can eat a box of them.<br />I'm still dying for a cigarette.
1526241 1529368 - What, you cut yourself shaving?<br />- Yeah.
1529536 1533205 - Old razor?<br />- Old face.
1534791 1538544 I think you're really letting this<br />retirement thing get you down, Rog.
1538712 1541881 Why don't you spend a couple<br />more years, think it over. Why quit?
1542049 1544258 - I got plans for my retirement.<br />- Yeah, plans.
1544426 1546218 - I do. Big plans.<br />- Sure. Big plans?
1546386 1548346 - I had them for a long time.<br />- Like what?
1548513 1549930 Like, uh...
1550807 1554560 - Uh, hey, things, man. Okay, yeah, huh?<br />- Things. Things.
1554728 1556771 Yeah, yeah. Things I've put off too long.
1556938 1559857 - Those things. I got those things too.<br />- Yeah, Riggs. Right.
1560025 1563152 I can see you've given this<br />a lot of thought, Rog, actually.
1565113 1566614 Yeah.
1567616 1569825 I've given it a lot of thought, Riggs.
1588804 1590513 Goddamn it!
1590680 1591847 What the hell's going on?
1592015 1593641 I'm pissed off! You need a reason?
1593809 1595059 I thought I heard gunfire.
1595227 1597311 Get your hearing checked. Put that away.
1597938 1601482 - What are you looking at?<br />- Hey, man. Peace.
1622796 1627466 - Riggs, why'd you call us down here?<br />- Everybody, it's all right.
1627634 1630511 - Hey, how you doing, son?<br />- Your mother know you're here?
1634015 1635599 Hey, did you do this?
1635767 1638310 - Nice shooting, phew.<br />- Regular Billy the Kid, huh?
1639688 1641480 Diaper rash makes you cranky, huh?
1641648 1644525 Give that to your mom.<br />Maybe she'll stick it on the refrigerator.
1644693 1647278 - Hey, can I borrow your glasses?<br />- Yeah.
1647446 1650322 Okay, who's wearing?<br />Roger, you're wearing. I need you.
1650490 1654535 - Why me? You guys should be wearing.<br />- Mr. Murtaugh, let me assist you.
1654703 1656871 I've been dressing myself since I was 30.
1657038 1659331 - Okay, man, just trying to help.<br />- Just get back.
1659499 1662042 - All you perverts, turn your heads.<br />- Take it off.
1662210 1663794 Hold this shirt.
1663962 1665045 Woo-hoo.
1665213 1667089 Wearing a girdle, man.
1667257 1669508 - He's got a girdle!<br />- This is not a girdle.
1669676 1672553 This is not a girdle. It's my back.<br />My back went out on me.
1672721 1675764 - He hurt his back.<br />- Hurt my back this morning lifting weights.
1675932 1678476 What you talking about?<br />I hurt my back lifting weights.
1678643 1681228 Yeah, I saw him do it.<br />Okay, everybody, listen up.
1681396 1684273 I want you all to have a look<br />at these lovely bullets.
1684441 1686400 - These are cute.<br />- Notice the smooth jacket.
1686568 1690154 Pay particular attention to the tip.<br />Good close look at it.
1693742 1697203 Now, you've all seen these vests<br />stop a. 357 magnum bullet, haven't you?
1697370 1698996 - Yeah.<br />- So what?
1699164 1700456 Okay.
1701750 1702917 Observe.
1717933 1719808 Son of a bitch.
1721520 1723979 - Armor-piercing bullets? Jesus.<br />- Yeah, cop killers.
1724147 1725648 - Shit.<br />- Serious shit.
1725815 1728901 Those bullets came from the gun<br />of a suspect we arrested yesterday.
1729069 1731612 - Armored-car guy?<br />- Yeah. They're out on the streets.
1731780 1734740 Vests are optional, boys and girls.<br />Especially boys.
1734908 1736951 - Holy fuck.<br />- See you, Riggs.
1737118 1738911 Well, let's just keep our eyes open.
1739079 1740788 Cop killers.
1742791 1744667 Son of a bitch.
1747087 1748963 I, uh, think we should<br />talk to Billy Phelps.
1749130 1751465 I'll have him brought down<br />for interrogation, okay?
1752551 1753884 Yeah.
1759766 1762309 I'm here to talk to a prisoner, sergeant,<br />Billy Phelps.
1762477 1765604 - Can I see all your ID there?<br />- Sure.
1765772 1768983 William Phelps, armored-car suspect.<br />He's been moved to interrogation.
1769150 1771652 - Know where that is?<br />- Sure. Been there a lot.
1771903 1772945 Okay.
1781913 1783163 Same floor.
1783540 1784999 - Hey, Rog.<br />- Hm?
1785166 1786458 I guess now you're retiring...
1786626 1789044 ...that, uh, Swiss bank account<br />is gonna come in pretty handy.
1790422 1792840 How much you got in there, a million?<br />Million and a half?
1793174 1795509 - Five.<br />- Five.
1795677 1797177 Well, you deserve it, man.
1797345 1800681 It's better than those miserable<br />drug dealers getting it.
1804686 1806312 What are you talking about?
1806479 1809773 Hey, don't sweat it. You laundered it,<br />didn't you? They can't trace it.
1810650 1812484 - They can't trace it.<br />- Well, now, heh...
1812652 1815863 Look, so long as I get an invite<br />to the Casa de Murtaugh, I'm happy.
1816031 1817406 Casa what?
1817574 1819783 - I've never been to Portugal.<br />- Stop joking.
1819951 1821702 - She's a cop, man.<br />- I know she's a cop.
1821870 1824371 She's probably on the take too.<br />What do you take me for?
1824539 1826957 Come on. The whole force is bent.
1827125 1830002 Look, she may be wearing a skirt,<br />but we're all brothers.
1830170 1831420 I don't have nothing there.
1831588 1833422 - I ain't been to Portugal.<br />- Beautiful.
1833590 1836383 This Murtaugh... This...
1838970 1841138 Son of a bitch.
1841306 1842348 Hey, how you doing?
1842515 1843974 - Fine.<br />- Who is it today?
1844142 1845434 - Billy...<br />- Billy Phelps.
1846019 1847061 Huh.
1847228 1848854 - Who are you?<br />- Fly me.
1849022 1851065 I'm your friendly Portuguese airline.
1851608 1854360 - She's Infernal Affairs, Rog.<br />- How'd you know?
1854527 1858238 Well, I took the liberty of looking<br />at your file folder. It was showing.
1858406 1860157 Lorna Cole.
1860450 1863160 - And you're Sergeant Murtaugh.<br />- I used to be.
1863328 1866246 Yeah, what's Infernal Repairs<br />want with our collar?
1866414 1870125 - We're taking over, thanks.<br />- Nobody told us they were taking over.
1870293 1873504 - Nobody has to tell you anything.<br />- I wanna go and see the captain.
1873672 1875005 You wanna go see the captain?
1875173 1876924 - Let's go see the captain.<br />- All right.
1877092 1879259 - And, uh, put on a vest.<br />- Oh, are you wearing one?
1879427 1883097 - Hey, hey, hey. Just take it easy, man.<br />- Okay.
1894401 1897069 Hey, guys. Phelps, William.<br />Actually, his name's Billy.
1897237 1898946 - Phelps? You too?<br />- Hi.
1899114 1901448 - Popular guy today.<br />- Somebody with him?
1901616 1904618 No, not really.<br />He's down the hall to the right.
1904786 1907371 - Wanna sign in here, sarge?<br />- Sure.
1907539 1909164 - Miss.<br />- Thank you.
1909332 1912793 - What's Internal Affairs doing here?<br />- Don't start. I just found out myself.
1912961 1915212 This is Herman Walters,<br />chief of intelligence.
1915380 1917297 You haven't met his daughter,<br />Lorna Doone.
1917465 1919049 - Cole.<br />- Pleased to meet you.
1919217 1922094 The Phelps case has been<br />transferred to Internal Affairs.
1922262 1924138 - Why? Tell me why.<br />- I can't tell you.
1924305 1925639 - That's classified.<br />- Classi...?
1925807 1928559 - We busted our buns busting this guy.<br />- Busted is right.
1928727 1930227 He spent the night in hospital.
1930395 1932354 - He forgot to buckle.<br />- We cited him for it.
1932522 1934815 - I know. I read your report.<br />- Yeah.
1934983 1937651 You know, our cases have unfortunately<br />crossed paths here.
1937819 1940154 That's all I can say.<br />We'll take over from here.
1940321 1942030 Captain, what's she talking about?
1942198 1945033 - That's classified.<br />- I said, "Captain. " I'm talking to him.
1945702 1946827 I'm telling you...
1946995 1949163 I said, "Captain. "<br />I'm talking to the captain.
1949330 1951165 - That's classified.<br />- I'm talking to him.
1951332 1953959 - Bullshit!<br />- Murtaugh. Hey, hey. Riggs!
1955754 1958922 Look, maybe these guys<br />can contribute something to this case.
1959090 1962551 From their records, the only thing<br />they contribute is mayhem and chaos.
1962719 1964887 I'm Chaos and he's Mayhem.<br />We're a double act.
1965054 1968432 - Are we required reading or something?<br />- As a matter of fact, you are.
1968600 1971643 It's a cross between Police Gazette<br />and Mad magazine.
1971811 1974313 - What's wrong with Mad?<br />- Nothing, I used to read it.
1974481 1977649 - Oh, yeah, you've got some good taste.<br />- When I was 12.
1977817 1980527 - When you... Yeah.<br />- Hey, hey. Riggs, let's go.
1980695 1982696 We busted him, we can talk to him.<br />Let's go.
1982864 1985032 - Captain.<br />- Riggs. Murtaugh.
1985200 1987326 Get your asses back here.
1990413 1992206 You'll be needing these.
1993041 1994875 I'm reinstating both of you.
1995543 1997377 - Don't you just love him?<br />- Yeah.
1998004 2000214 - God.<br />- No. You're Murtaugh and I'm Riggs.
2000965 2002424 You really are a beautiful man.
2002592 2004551 Yeah, right. Just get rid of the blues.
2004719 2007221 - They don't go with the ponytail.<br />- Absolutely not.
2009307 2011558 - Yeah, right.<br />- And get a haircut.
2011726 2015103 - Of course I won't.<br />- You just exceeded your authority, captain.
2015271 2017648 - That's not the way I see it.<br />- The chief will.
2017816 2019858 - Well, take it up with him.<br />- I think I will.
2020026 2021568 We don't want this screwed up.
2021736 2024988 You're gonna have to get him<br />between lunches. Son of a bitch.
2027700 2029243 Hi, Billy.
2031663 2034414 - Jack.<br />- Bye, Billy.
2041631 2043257 See you, Billy.
2049848 2051849 Sergeant, did you get what you need?
2052016 2054601 Not really. It's a dead issue, I'm afraid.
2056271 2058355 How long has Phelps been doing this?
2058523 2061316 - Doing what?<br />- His armored-car thing.
2061484 2064611 - I wouldn't know.<br />- I'm not interested in armored cars.
2077876 2079835 I don't think she's telling us everything.
2080003 2081336 Yeah, I think you're right.
2081504 2084298 Boy, these six days is gonna be rough.
2084465 2087009 God, be good to me, please.
2088428 2091054 Shit, son of a bitch knew<br />there was a camera in the wall.
2091222 2093056 Look how he's covering up.
2093224 2095017 - Damn it.<br />- Didn't know there was one...
2095184 2096476 ...in the interrogation room.
2096644 2097978 - There isn't.<br />- Yeah.
2098855 2100272 Installed them six months ago.
2100440 2102274 - Every station.<br />- That's great.
2102442 2104443 Six months, and we don't know about it?
2104611 2106653 This is the police police, captain.
2106821 2110282 "Police police. " Can you say<br />that three times in a row, real fast?
2110450 2112659 - Am I getting to you?<br />- You trying to bait me?
2112827 2115329 - I'm a master of it.<br />- Well, that figures.
2115496 2118332 Hey, heh, baiting master. Great.<br />I'll try that on Trish.
2118499 2121710 Freeze that. Stop it. Jack Travis.
2121878 2125756 - Who?<br />- Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
2126257 2127633 He was one of us.
2127800 2130636 Hell of a brutal cop.<br />Could beat a confession out of anyone.
2130803 2132012 One hell of a dirty cop.
2132180 2135891 Never seen so many suspensions and<br />reprimands and charges of misconduct.
2136059 2138685 Well, he's also as tough as they come.
2139145 2141355 - What happened to him?<br />- I don't know.
2141522 2145025 His partner and him were on a stakeout.<br />He went for coffee, never came back.
2145193 2147861 Looks like he's had<br />one cappuccino too many.
2148029 2149529 We better brief Walters.
2150490 2152532 Excuse me, cute stuff.
2152700 2154993 - That's harassment.<br />- "Cute stuff. " That's you.
2155954 2159623 - Captain.<br />- Boys, boys. Just the captain.
2159791 2163210 Your involvement in this case ended<br />when Billy Phelps hit the floor.
2163378 2166129 Why don't you go back<br />and beat your street?
2166297 2167339 Really good work.
2167507 2169466 - Now's the time to buy.<br />- Leo, Not now.
2169634 2171593 - Hey, Roger, Roger.<br />- Not now, Leo.
2171761 2174554 - No, no. Not now.<br />- We gotta talk, babe, okay?
2174722 2176598 You're in trouble. You got termites.
2176766 2178016 - Termites?<br />- Uh-huh.
2178184 2180268 - Oh, God.<br />- You're infested.
2180436 2182729 The only thing holding up your house<br />is the paint.
2182897 2186066 Rog, I think we should go.<br />Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
2186234 2188819 We should go to Evidence,<br />pull every file on this guy.
2188987 2191279 I know this guy.<br />What are you watching, Geraldo?
2191447 2192698 - What?<br />- I know the guy.
2192865 2195075 - How do you know him?<br />- I've seen the guy before.
2195243 2197577 - Hey, where?<br />- I don't know. I recognize him...
2197745 2200706 His name's Jack Travis, Leo.<br />Does that ring a bell? Jack Travis.
2200873 2203625 Hey, hey, hey.<br />Hands off the clothes. Okay, baby?
2203793 2206503 - Okay, I'm thinking. Let me think. Okay.<br />- Think.
2206671 2208296 - A big party.<br />- Okay.
2208464 2211883 Somebody brought a monkey because<br />the monkey knocked over the salad bar.
2212051 2215095 And this guy comes in,<br />introduced me to another guy...
2215263 2217305 ...who wants a favor.
2217473 2219182 - I got it. I got it. I got it!<br />- What?
2219350 2220183 He got it.
2220476 2222477 - I remember! I remember!<br />- You remember!
2222645 2225605 Hey, don't do it.<br />Don't let the earring fool you.
2225773 2227941 - Hey, we're back. We're back.<br />- Yeah. Yeah.
2228109 2229443 - All right. Listen.<br />- Yeah.
2229610 2231236 Think I could get a gun this time?
2231404 2232863 No!
2242165 2247002 Okay, this is it. See, these guys always<br />wanted me to do favors for them.
2247170 2251048 Like, some guys wanted broads,<br />another guy wanted Cuban cigars.
2251215 2255510 Your guy, hockey.<br />The best seats in the house.
2257472 2260348 - Where's the seats?<br />- Yeah.
2260516 2263268 Uh, probably by the glass.<br />Around the glass.
2263436 2265687 Does "needle in a haystack"<br />mean anything to you?
2265855 2267355 Why don't we spread out?
2267523 2271943 You know, if we all take a different<br />direction, it'd be like old times.
2272111 2275072 Don't push, lady.<br />I'm on police business here.
2275239 2277199 Just take it easy, now.
2289670 2293006 Go! All right!
2304936 2308063 Los Angeles<br />penalty. Number 15, Tony Brown.

2338594 2341847 We know you're in here. We know<br />where you are. Just stay in your seat.
2342014 2343890 Don't be stupid.
2344183 2346518 And I'll be there to escort you out<br />in a minute.
2346686 2349813 There's policemen at every exit,<br />so it's no use trying to run.
2349981 2351940 - Stay where you are.<br />- Smart son of a bitch.
2352108 2354568 Thank you for your cooperation.<br />Play on, boys.
2369292 2370500 Come on, let's go!
2380928 2383096 Get out of my fucking way!
2385766 2389811 Ooh! Ooh! Riggs! Riggs! Roger! Roger!
2394192 2396234 Ooh! Excuse me. Excuse me.
2403451 2406161 - Hey!<br />- Riggs!
2409207 2410415 You can't be on the ice.
2415129 2417047 Ooh! Ooh!
2417798 2419549 I got him. I got him.
2421677 2424804 You have the right to remain...<br />You're under arrest.
2434148 2436650 - Fucking weasel.<br />- What the hell's going on here?
2436817 2437817 I'm L.A.P.D. L.A.P.D.
2437985 2440278 I don't care. You can't be on the ice.
2440446 2442906 What is this, a convention?
2447536 2450080 - I got him.<br />- You're all right, pal. Just stay calm.
2454001 2455210 Tell my mother, Rog.
2455378 2458046 - Where did he go?<br />- Down there. Down there.
2468474 2471017 Son of a bitch.
2472853 2474854 He thinks I don't know I'm dying.<br />I know it.
2475022 2478275 - No. You'll be okay.<br />- Yeah, yeah. I'm dying, Roger.
2478442 2481695 - You'll be okay.<br />- I'm choking, see?
2481862 2483822 This is what they do when they die.<br />I saw them.
2483990 2487325 - Leo, it's gonna be okay.<br />- Yeah, well, I'm... I'm numb.
2487493 2489619 My whole body's numb. I can't feel it.
2489787 2492455 - Leo, Leo.<br />- I'm gonna die, I know it. What?
2492873 2494457 You're lying on the ice.
2496377 2499296 - That's why I'm cold?<br />- That's why you're cold.
2499463 2501631 - That's why I'm numb, huh?<br />- That's why you're numb.
2501799 2503508 He shot me. Look at all the blood.
2503676 2506594 - It's just a flesh wound.<br />- So it's okay.
2506762 2509055 - Let's get you up. One, two, three.<br />- Yeah.
2509223 2511474 There you go. You're gonna make it.
2511642 2514602 He's okay, he's okay.<br />He's gonna make it. He's alive.
2514770 2516521 Ooh! Ow, ow!
2520985 2524571 - Bring him this way, guys.<br />- I can't believe this. I just...
2524739 2526990 - I can't believe I got shot.<br />- You'll be all right.
2527158 2528450 - Riggs, you here?<br />- Calm down.
2528617 2531745 We're all the same now.<br />We all got shot.
2531912 2533872 - You'll be fine.<br />- Ouch. That's...
2534040 2537167 - Relax, Mr. Getz.<br />- I'm fine. Nothing wrong with me.
2537335 2538710 I can take this. Ouch!
2538878 2542088 - We're gonna take care of it.<br />- You'll be out of here. No big deal.
2542256 2544507 I don't think that's a good idea.<br />You shouldn't rush this.
2544675 2546343 - Yeah.<br />- You should rest up, Leo.
2546510 2547927 A dumdum wound can be serious.
2548596 2550180 What's a dumdum wound?
2550723 2554726 You don't know? A guy got his thumb<br />shot off by a dumdum.
2554894 2556936 From the shock,<br />he was dead two days later.
2557104 2558730 Dead two days later?
2558898 2560231 He died from dumdums?
2560399 2562817 - We'll keep you overnight.<br />- Yeah, take it slow.
2562985 2565278 Two days? All right,<br />we'll keep him two days.
2565446 2567781 - You'll be here two days.<br />- That Leo's chart?
2567948 2570700 - Two days, you'll be good as new.<br />- I should be with them.
2570868 2573244 - Bye, Leo.<br />- I should be with... Hey! Ow! Ouch!
2573913 2577290 - How do you spell, "proctological"?<br />- Rectal exam?
2577666 2580627 - No, you can't do that to Leo.<br />- Sure we can.
2580795 2583338 - Why's she taking...?<br />- Please, Mr. Getz. You'll get...
2583506 2586549 You've been shot in the arm.<br />Let her take it. You'll get it back.
2586717 2588468 - Okay.<br />- There's a clock in your room.
2588636 2590637 - Okay, fine. Riggs.<br />- Yeah?
2590805 2592222 This look like a dumdum wound?
2592973 2595350 - It sounded like one when it happened.<br />- Shit.
2595518 2598269 - Take it easy. Two days.<br />- Two days and you'll be out.
2598437 2599479 - All right.<br />- Okay?
2599647 2602315 - Hey, I'll see you guys.<br />- We won't make a move without you.
2602483 2604567 I thought that bullet sounded different.
2604735 2607153 - Relax. They'll be there when you get out.<br />- I'm fine.
2607321 2609614 - You own your own house, doc?<br />- What?
2609782 2611699 - You don't recognize my face?<br />- No, sir.
2611867 2613159 Watch.
2613869 2617288 About time. These doggy treats<br />are okay, but I need some human food.
2617456 2618498 Don't worry.
2618666 2622127 I'm about to make you one of the best<br />things you ever had in your life.
2622503 2626923 - Hey, you ever eat one of my hamburgers?<br />- I've been lucky so far. I'll take a chance.
2627091 2629968 Yeah. Hey, Fast Eddie.
2630136 2632011 - How's business?<br />- Booming. Can't you tell?
2632179 2633221 I'm looking at it.
2633389 2634764 - You meet my partner?<br />- No.
2634932 2637767 I wanna cook one<br />of those monster burgers for him.
2637935 2639185 - Go for it.<br />- All right.
2639353 2641354 - Gonna let him cook?<br />- Do I have a choice?
2641522 2644983 - No, because it's Wednesday.<br />- Too big to argue with.
2645568 2647652 In that case, give me a McRog.
2647820 2649737 - Hold the hair.<br />- Heh, heh.
2649905 2650947 You wash your hands?
2651115 2654742 Keep joking, but I guarantee<br />you're gonna like this burger.
2654910 2658705 And you're gonna come back<br />with your friends.
2658873 2662500 I haven't got any friends,<br />you know that, Rog. Well, except you.
2662668 2664377 He's a comedian in his spare time.
2664545 2667213 Oh, yeah?<br />When is he gonna say something funny?
2667381 2671009 Hey, uh, you gonna put that out?<br />You're finished with it, yeah?
2671177 2672886 Do you mind, huh? Thanks.
2675222 2677056 Sorry. I was just looking at it.
2677475 2679142 - Chew on this onion.<br />- Yeah.
2679310 2682187 - Yeah. He's quitting, so help him, okay?<br />- I quit.
2682897 2684898 I was only looking at it.
2686859 2689569 Ah. First thing is the fat.
2689737 2692238 Everybody says, "Cut the fat. "
2692406 2695074 My uncle said,<br />"You cut the fat, you kill the burger. "
2695242 2696993 - Yep.<br />- There's an art to this.
2697161 2699204 You just can't plop this on the grill.
2702249 2705043 Gently coax the flavors out.
2706670 2708254 - Yo, hey.<br />- What's the problem?
2715554 2718932 A little pepper,<br />then you massage it a little bit.
2719099 2722727 Just a little bit. Sweet, sweet meat.
2725773 2727398 Shit, man, feel it.
2731195 2734072 Okay, guys. L.A.P.D.<br />Let me see your hands.
2734532 2736741 Come on, let me see your hands.<br />Get them up!
2736909 2740370 In the car. Get them up there.<br />Let me see both of them. Come on!
2745000 2746626 Hey, Riggs.
2754552 2755927 Riggs!
2756554 2759055 God, don't you love me? Five days.
2766814 2768648 Don't do that shit to me.
2768816 2770233 - Riggs, you okay?<br />- Yeah.
2770401 2772443 Come on. Who did it?
2774655 2777615 All right, asshole.<br />I wanna see your hands right now.
2804518 2805977 Back me up, Riggs!
2831754 2833504 Darryl?
2839178 2841554 Oh, fuck, no. Darryl!
2844850 2848519 Call an ambulance.<br />Riggs, call an ambulance. Breathe.
2849063 2852315 Breathe.
2852483 2854734 Call an ambulance, Riggs.
2855569 2857654 Hey, come on. Breathe. Oh, God.
2857821 2859489 Fuck, it's Darryl.
2860199 2861574 Darryl, breathe.
2861742 2863409 God, don't do this to me. Breathe.
2863577 2865244 - He's dead, Rog.<br />- Fucking breathe!
2865412 2868665 - Breathe! God, don't do this.<br />- He's dead, Rog.
2868832 2871209 He's dead, Rog. Rog, he's dead.
2871377 2873503 He's dead, Rog.<br />Don't mess with it, man.
2873671 2877256 He's dead. Come on, man,<br />it was a clean shoot.
2877424 2879300 It's okay, it was a clean shoot.
2879468 2881469 He was gonna do you,<br />he was gonna do me.
2882096 2883262 It's okay. You okay?
2884223 2885932 It's not okay.
2886266 2888935 - What?<br />- I know that kid.
2891271 2892563 I know that kid.
2894108 2896109 He's Nick's friend.
2913794 2915753 - Got it, Mom.<br />- I'll get it.
2915921 2919132 Hello? Hi, Martin.
2919550 2921050 He's not here.
2928350 2930435 Oh, my God.
2933021 2934647 Thanks.
2963594 2965511 Fuck. Fuck.
2971393 2973186 How you doing? Taking your vitamins?
2973353 2975480 - Riggs, how's Murtaugh?<br />- He's good. He's fine.
2975647 2977023 Morning, captain.
2977191 2980193 - I'm sure he's anything but fine.<br />- Really, he's okay.
2980360 2983404 - I'd really like to talk to him.<br />- I don't think that's a good idea.
2983572 2986157 I think the best thing you could do<br />is leave him alone.
2986325 2989869 - Let's, uh, get something for your cold.<br />- I know what I'm talking about, Riggs.
2990871 2994165 - You and I have to talk.<br />- Talking to you is bad for my image.
2994333 2996167 - I'm afraid I insist.<br />- Oh, you insist?
2996335 2998586 Well, in that case,<br />let's find somewhere private.
2998754 3000880 Here, step into my orifice.
3003592 3005218 Here.
3006637 3008137 Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?
3008305 3009555 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Yeah.
3009723 3013351 - Clip any wrong wires lately?<br />- No, I haven't done that for a couple days.
3013519 3015770 - Next time, wait for the bomb squad.<br />- Bomb squad.
3015938 3017021 Yeah, it's our job.
3017189 3019982 Okay, I'll remember that. We saved a cat.<br />What do you want?
3020150 3022860 - Great. I love cats.<br />- Hey.
3023987 3025613 Go ahead, talk. I'm listening.
3025781 3029575 You purposefully withheld information<br />concerning a case under my investigation.
3029743 3033120 - Yeah, damn right I did.<br />- Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
3033288 3036040 You had a tip on Travis,<br />you should have shared it with me.
3036208 3037834 No, I take that back.
3038001 3040586 You were required to share it with me.
3040754 3043130 - I was required to share it with you?<br />- Yeah.
3043298 3045258 I don't have to share shit with you.
3045425 3048678 If you don't scratch<br />my back, I don't throw you...
3048846 3051597 - Oh, come on, Riggs. I can't do that.<br />- Yes, you can.
3051765 3054684 Why don't you cut out<br />this classified bullshit?
3054852 3057019 Right now. It's giving me the shits!
3057187 3059939 We're cops. You're a cop, I'm a cop.<br />We're on the same side.
3060107 3061274 - Right? Right?<br />- Right!
3061441 3064527 Right? Good.<br />Why don't we start to act like it, huh?
3064695 3066612 Come on, there's kids out there. Babies.
3066780 3068781 No brains,<br />but they got automatic weapons.
3068949 3072076 - Yesterday, my partner, he nailed this kid...<br />- I know about Murtaugh.
3073996 3076956 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah. And I'm sorry, Riggs.
3077916 3079500 Yeah.
3082421 3083796 Look, uh...
3084256 3086757 Look, why don't you let me in on this?<br />I can help you.
3086925 3090136 I really wanna help you, if you'll let me.<br />Let me.
3090304 3092388 Come on, what do you say?<br />We got a deal?
3096310 3097643 Wash your hands, Riggs.
3100230 3103107 And, um, meet me in my office.
3103442 3106944 Yeah, yeah. Okay. I'll be right there.
3108780 3109822 Be right there.
3110699 3112450 MAC-10, 9 mm, semi-automatic...
3112618 3115745 - ... converted to automatic...<br />- With 36 rounds in the magazine.
3115913 3119582 On a sesame-seed bun. Very illegal.
3119750 3122668 - That gun has a history. Wanna know it?<br />- Tell me.
3126173 3128799 Killed a convenience-store clerk<br />in L.A. County, July 1990.
3128967 3133387 Was used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990.
3133555 3138517 Confiscated by a truant officer<br />of the L.A. School Board, October 1990.
3138685 3141312 Scheduled for destruction by the L.A.P.D.<br />six weeks ago.
3141480 3143940 - Scheduled for destruction?<br />- Yeah.
3144107 3146108 But it never got there.
3148153 3151113 Instead, it found its way into the hands<br />of a 15-year-old boy...
3151281 3153532 ...who fired on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3153700 3157036 - Thought it looked familiar.<br />- That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3157204 3160831 ...were stolen from a police storage<br />facility before they could be destroyed.
3160999 3164001 They should be paper clips right now<br />or license plates.
3164169 3167713 Anything but a gun. Here we are,<br />busting our asses on the streets...
3167881 3172093 ...to get these weapons out of circulation<br />and now they're headed right back out.
3172260 3174804 When you busted Phelps,<br />you stumbled onto something...
3174972 3177056 ...the department's<br />trying to keep a lid on.
3177224 3180601 That's why Internal Affairs is on this.<br />They think it's an inside job.
3180769 3183354 Yeah, that's right.<br />They knew police procedures.
3183522 3185773 They knew where the guns were<br />and how to get in.
3185941 3188234 They knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3188402 3191195 ...because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3191363 3194073 - It all pointed to a cop.<br />- Or an ex-cop.
3194366 3196409 - Right. Travis.<br />- Travis.
3199079 3201163 And you let him slip<br />through your fingers.
3202416 3205876 - That's closer than you ever got.<br />- Close, Riggs?
3206044 3209088 Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window.
3211800 3215219 - You wanna go for a ride?<br />- Sure, where we going?
3215595 3217179 Surprise.
3221852 3223936 Oh, I love surprises.
3224187 3225563 What is this place?
3225731 3228232 I accessed Billy Phelps'<br />phone records on my computer.
3228400 3230192 He made a dozen calls to this address.
3230360 3232528 - Yeah?<br />- Nice of you to steal that information.
3232696 3233738 Semantics, Riggs.
3233905 3236949 Semantics? I'm always up for some antics.
3237659 3242455 - All right, let's go on three. One...<br />- Uh, on three, or three and then go?
3242622 3244331 - What?<br />- Never mind. One, two, three.
3247711 3249128 Gotcha.
3262976 3265061 Looks like Billy's grandmother<br />owns a big dog.
3265228 3266812 That isn't a dog. That's a horse.
3267481 3269440 I hate dogs, Riggs.
3270067 3272276 - I don't get it.<br />- You don't get what?
3272444 3274403 That's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
3274571 3279617 No, I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window. " I don't get that.
3279785 3281660 Riggs, later.
3285957 3288667 - What are you doing?<br />- Well, I can't shoot a dog.
3288835 3290503 People, okay, but not dogs.
3290670 3293130 I think I should try<br />and make friends with him.
3293298 3295633 - Make friends?<br />- Yeah.
3295801 3299512 Now, don't run, because he'll only<br />chase you down and kill you.
3299679 3301263 Uh-huh.
3301973 3304892 Here, boy. Here, boy.
3312317 3315027 - Here. Good boy. Yes.<br />- Shit.
3322369 3323619 Riggs.
3329000 3330292 You're crazy.
3350397 3353357 Want one? Want one?<br />You hungry? Huh?
3355068 3356569 You're a hungry boy.
3356736 3359071 Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
3359489 3361490 What a good fella.
3361658 3363951 Here. Here's more. Leave some for me.
3364119 3368080 Very slowly, as if you're not here,<br />just walk away.
3368248 3371333 - You want me to go?<br />- Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
3371501 3374295 - Guy sort of thing?<br />- Are you all alone in here?
3383597 3384763 Stay, stay.
3386892 3388601 Come on, let's go.
3399571 3401447 - Let's go. Let's go.<br />- Watch.
3401615 3402948 On two.
3409789 3411665 - All right, how many is that?<br />- Fifty-five.
3411833 3415127 Fifty-five. All right, we got eight more.
3415295 3417504 All right, we'll get these later. Let's go.
3421134 3424470 Hi, fellas. What's in all these boxes?
3435398 3439568 Easy, let's not kill him yet.<br />Let's see who he is first, all right?
3441947 3443489 You have the right to remain silent.
3443657 3445407 Shut him up.
3445575 3447785 Sergeant Martin Riggs, heh.
3449829 3451914 - Hubie, get the truck ready.<br />- Right.
3452082 3453582 So, Sergeant Riggs...
3453750 3455334 ...how did you find us?
3455502 3456794 Freeze. Police!
3458463 3459672 Oh, another one?
3460090 3461674 We need a new fucking dog.
3461841 3463676 Get your hands up, asshole.
3463843 3465678 Get them up.
3468974 3471183 A little bit higher. That's better.
3472686 3474311 Very good.
3478275 3480109 Drop it, miss.
3481778 3483028 Now, look...
3531077 3533537 Okay, I'm on. No, I'm not. I'm off! Wait!
3533705 3536373 Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
3539836 3543213 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Get down! Get down!
3546760 3548344 Get those cases and kill that dog.
3560565 3562941 Stop! The dog. Wait for the dog.
3563109 3566028 - Where'd you learn to fight?<br />- Catholic school. Forget the dog.
3566196 3569615 Here, boy. Come on. We're waiting<br />for the dog. Just hold it, hold it.
3569783 3573118 Hurry. Come on, dog.<br />Good dog. Good puppy. Go! Go!
3575622 3576789 Stop!
3576956 3578791 - What? What?<br />- Guns.
3578958 3580084 - Full of guns.<br />- Grab one.
3580251 3581960 - You grab one.<br />- You got friends?
3582128 3583587 Step on it!
3587300 3589301 Get that crate. Come on.
3595141 3597476 Hatchett, you said<br />not to worry about the police...
3597644 3599520 ...but the cops are all over you, man.
3599687 3602064 They got my guns.<br />They'll be coming after me next.
3602232 3604400 Far as I'm concerned, the deal's off.
3604567 3607736 Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone, all right?<br />We have a deal.
3607904 3609321 Nobody backs out.
3609489 3611490 You said you had the cops under control.
3611658 3615327 I see that isn't so. Give me one reason<br />why I should do business with you.
3615495 3619415 - I'll give you a real good reason.<br />- Hey, Tyrone, this is Travis.
3619582 3623710 You back out now, and I'll make certain<br />that only your dentist can identify the body.
3623878 3626171 Is that a good enough reason for you?
3628591 3630300 But I need ammo.
3630468 3632386 I'm out of business without ammo.
3632554 3636640 - I need the good stuff.<br />- You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3637851 3639560 "The good stuff. " Jesus. Pfft!
3639727 3641854 Time to pay another visit to the L.A.P.D.
3644023 3645732 You look like I feel.
3656035 3659079 Hey. Hey.
3659247 3661457 You got anything I can put on my head?
3661624 3663000 There's a hat in the closet.
3663168 3667754 You're all heart. Here I thought you were<br />gonna get all tender and maternal with me.
3667922 3670340 Listen, Riggs,<br />I was raised with four brothers.
3670508 3671758 We got hurt all the time...
3671926 3675179 ...but if no bones were broken<br />or blood wasn't gushing, nobody cared.
3675346 3677723 - Hey, look, blood. See? Blood.<br />- It's not gushing.
3677891 3680559 Well, it was free-flowing earlier.
3680935 3682895 Could you bring me<br />a needle and thread?
3683062 3686523 You know, maybe some peroxide.<br />I can patch it up myself.
3688568 3691487 - Don't touch anything.<br />- I wasn't. I didn't...
3693239 3694948 What's with you, anyway?
3710256 3713300 - The boys.<br />- Hey, what are you doing, huh?
3713468 3716094 - I told you not to touch anything.<br />- Uh, this came on by itself.
3716262 3718514 - Came on all by itself? You a wise guy?<br />- I swear.
3718681 3720599 You don't like to share your toys?
3720767 3722518 - This isn't a toy, Riggs.<br />- What is it?
3722685 3724436 - This is a weapon. Yeah.<br />- A weapon?
3724604 3726605 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3726773 3729066 What, do you throw it at people?<br />Pretty heavy.
3729234 3731944 You're gonna give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3732111 3733111 Right here.
3733279 3735447 - Okay, take a little off the top.<br />- Right here.
3741621 3743956 - You bring all your interrogations home?<br />- Okay.
3744123 3746583 - What are we talking about?<br />- Well, it's back here.
3746751 3748126 Careful. Careful.
3748294 3749795 - Careful. Oh.<br />- This?
3749963 3752464 - This scratch?<br />- Come on, it feels like Grand Canyon.
3752632 3754424 - Oh, God.<br />- Ah!
3754592 3756051 - Hold still.<br />- Yeah.
3756219 3760180 - Ah!<br />- Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3760348 3761598 Be gentle with me.
3762350 3764977 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3765144 3769022 Huh? Oh, that's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3769274 3771817 - That's a natural mistake.<br />- What, I have a wooden head?
3771985 3773277 - Look at that.<br />- It's a knife.
3773444 3775571 - Knife? That's very knife.<br />- Mm-hm.
3775863 3776905 This is all right.
3777073 3779491 Oh, that's pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw. Mm-hm.
3779659 3782661 Hey, that's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this, huh?
3782829 3784830 Same damn thing. Third and Highland.
3784998 3787916 - Dragged for about half a block.<br />- That's a good one.
3788084 3790252 Feel that texture. Feel it.<br />Cheese-grater time.
3790420 3792504 - Moving truck.<br />- Moving truck? Ooh!
3792672 3794089 - Moving bullet.<br />- Moving bullet?
3794257 3796008 - Here. This is the best.<br />- Bullets now.
3796759 3799595 - It goes all the way to the back.<br />- Oh, hey. Right through?
3799762 3801346 You're lucky. What is it,.22?
3801514 3803015 - It's a. 38, Riggs.<br />- That's a. 38?
3803182 3806018 - It's a. 38.<br />- That's a wimpy. 38. This is a. 38.
3806185 3809104 - Yours is bigger than mine? Don't think so.<br />- I think so.
3809272 3810522 Maybe not, but look. Watch.
3810690 3813859 A whole family of. 44s on the back.
3814027 3816111 - Look, there they are.<br />- Impressive.
3816279 3819656 One got stuck in my lung.<br />I was breathing blood bubbles. Disgusting.
3819824 3821116 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3821284 3823160 - You got one?<br />- Mm.
3823328 3824953 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3825246 3826705 - Oh, yeah.<br />- Mm-hm.
3827248 3829958 - Yeah. Right down here. Went through.<br />- Oh.
3830126 3831335 - That must've hurt.<br />- Right.
3831502 3832544 - Not too close.<br />- Pfft!
3832712 3834630 Riggs, if he were that close, I'd be dead.
3834797 3837549 I can beat it. I can beat it.<br />Have a look at this.
3837717 3839968 - I'll take your word for it.<br />- You gotta see this.
3840136 3842888 - I'll take your word.<br />- This guy had a knife. You'll love it.
3843056 3845682 He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3846100 3848727 - Hurt like a son of a bitch.<br />- I'll take your word for it.
3848895 3850020 No, I said forget it.
3850188 3853106 - This is a blue-ribbon event.<br />- Forget it, Riggs.
3854192 3855233 Hey, you started this.
3855401 3858070 - Yeah, well, I can end it.<br />- You know what?
3858529 3859905 You're a very poor loser.
3861366 3862574 I didn't lose, Riggs.
3862742 3864493 - Yes, you did.<br />- No. No, I didn't lose.
3864661 3866244 - You lost.<br />- I conceded.
3866412 3868830 There's a difference between<br />losing and conceding.
3868998 3870666 You conceded or you're conceited?
3870833 3872918 - You think I'm conceited?<br />- Oh, yeah.
3873086 3875253 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3875421 3876463 I'll get a Band-Aid.
3876631 3879758 - Tell me you lost.<br />- I said, don't touch anything.
3891479 3894022 You're gonna smack<br />the shit out of me, right?
3894899 3896817 I can do better than that, Riggs.
3913918 3917295 This could be<br />a serious ethical breach here.
3917588 3919756 I never made it<br />with another sergeant before.
3919924 3921591 Shut up, Riggs.
3976522 3978023 Oh!
3979901 3982527 Oh, damn, Riggs.
3984322 3987741 - What do you want, Riggs?<br />- Just wanted to see how you were doing.
3987909 3989284 Who sent you? Trish?
3989452 3992078 Well, uh, you're doing pretty well.<br />Trish didn't send me.
3992246 3994790 Rianne came to see me.<br />She asked me to find you.
3994957 3997542 - Your place?<br />- Well, that's where I am.
3997710 4001880 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- Yeah.
4002048 4004508 - My daughter came to your trailer?<br />- What the hell?
4004675 4006301 Come on, Roger, she was worried.
4006469 4008386 Get off of my boat, Riggs.
4008554 4010388 - Oh, come on.<br />- Get off my boat.
4010556 4011890 Look, you're drunk, Rog.
4012058 4014226 That's something<br />you should know about, huh?
4014393 4016478 - This isn't gonna do any good.<br />- Give me that.
4016646 4018063 - No.<br />- Give me that.
4018231 4020065 Rog, please don't do this, okay?
4020233 4023568 You got three days until you retire.<br />This is not gonna do you any good.
4023736 4026112 - You self-righteous bastard. Give it.<br />- Roger!
4026280 4029991 - Look, don't do this, okay? Please.<br />- Give it to me, damn it, Riggs!
4030159 4033703 No! Oh, Jesus Christ.<br />What are you gonna do now, shoot me?
4033871 4035497 - Uh-huh.<br />- There.
4035665 4038250 Take your finger out of my bottle<br />and give me that gun.
4038417 4039584 The bottle's going south.
4041128 4042712 Son of a bitch.
4044590 4046424 Oh, shit.
4047385 4050053 - Not bad for an old man.<br />- You finished?
4050221 4052639 I got another bottle in the galley.<br />I'm gonna get it.
4052807 4056142 No, you're not.<br />Rog, don't do this to yourself, all right?
4056310 4058728 You gotta cut this out.
4059397 4061773 Oh, man, I'm sorry.<br />Are you okay? Are you okay?
4061941 4064317 All right. Sit down. Sit down. You okay?
4065695 4067445 - You hit me.<br />- Cool it, will you?
4067613 4069364 Cut it out. Just give it up, okay?
4069532 4070615 Go ahead.
4070783 4072784 Go ahead. Hit me again.
4072952 4075287 I don't wanna hit you.<br />You think I like this shit?
4075454 4078206 Hit me again, huh?<br />You think I'm afraid of you?
4078374 4080876 - I know you're not. Rog, no!<br />- Of that kung fu shit?
4081043 4082502 Please, Rog.
4083337 4085338 Look, that kid was a killer, all right.
4085506 4086923 That wasn't a toy in his hand.
4087091 4090385 That was a machine pistol<br />with twin carbines and all the trimmings.
4090553 4094097 He would have drilled you, me,<br />anybody that came along, all right?
4094265 4095807 You had no choice.
4096142 4098393 It didn't happen to you.<br />It happened to me.
4098561 4099936 It happened to me!
4100104 4102063 My God, I killed that kid.
4102231 4103773 I killed that boy.
4103941 4105817 Oh, yeah. You kill a lot of people.
4105985 4109654 You kill a fucking lot of people!<br />You ever kill a baby?
4109822 4112991 You got ice in your veins.<br />You ever kill a boy like Nick?
4113159 4116494 You selfish bastard! You selfish bastard!
4116662 4118955 You're just thinking about yourself!<br />Goddamn it.
4119123 4120957 What about me, huh?

4124462 4126087 What happens to you, happens to me.
4126255 4129341 After all the shit we've been through,<br />don't you get it?
4129634 4130967 Don't you get it?
4131886 4135138 When you retire, you're not just<br />retiring you, you're retiring us.
4135306 4137557 - You're retiring us.<br />- No. That's not my problem.
4137725 4139351 - Yes, it is.<br />- It's not my problem.
4139518 4141353 You're the only family I've got.

4144357 4147609 Trish does my laundry.<br />I live in your icebox. I live in your life.
4147777 4149861 What am I gonna do?<br />What am I supposed to do?

4164418 4169130 I don't know what I'm saying anymore.<br />I don't know what I'm thinking.
4169298 4172384 I had three days, and now this.
4173010 4174552 I'm sorry.
4174720 4176888 - That's all right.<br />- No, no, I'm sorry.
4178557 4179975 I didn't realize...
4180142 4182227 ...that my retirement's<br />gonna screw you up.
4182395 4186606 Forget it. I haven't got any problems.<br />I was out of line saying that shit.

4545841 4549719 - And you're pulling on the wrong string.<br />- That's not a very professional attitude.
4549887 4552138 - Who the fuck are you guys?<br />- Sorry. L.A.P.D.

4697451 4698910 Hey, Murphy.
4699077 4702580 - People cross the street when they see me.<br />- I didn't have enough time.
4702748 4706125 I'm not your enemy, captain.<br />I'm just trying to do my job.
4706627 4709587 - Have you eaten?<br />- I already ate. I gotta go downtown.
4709755 4711839 - What, do you eat alone?<br />- I'm used to it.
4712007 4713257 It's bad for the digestion.
4713425 4716135 Tomorrow you have lunch with me,<br />but I'm not paying.
4721266 4723100 The fuck is this?
4723268 4725019 Hey, buddy, you all right?

4752923 4756801 You wanna try something? Watch this.<br />This is called a backspin kick.
4756969 4758636 Pivot right, kick with your left...
4758804 4761931 ...and you whip that head around<br />to catch the target over there.
4762099 4763975 Get that head round and follow through.
4764142 4767144 Like so. So you whip the head.
4768605 4770147 All right?
4770315 4772483 Thank you. Thank you. Now you try it.

4785247 4787915 Just back up a little bit.<br />A little bit more. Okay, good.
4788083 4790167 Mind and body strong now,<br />grasshopper.

4805892 4809186 Man. Oh, Rog, man, I'm sorry.
4810689 4812481 Sergeant Murtaugh.
4812649 4817653 You could be experiencing some<br />transitional anger caused by the shooting.
4817821 4820072 You wanna talk about it?
4820741 4823159 - I think he's okay for a change, doc.<br />- Are you sure?
4823327 4826954 Yeah. You know, you really look good<br />in red. That's your color, I think.
4827331 4831167 - I've got a little extra time now, sergeant.<br />- I'm fine, doctor.
4836214 4837214 Oh, shit.

4846266 4848351 - Aah!<br />- Hi, skinny.
4848518 4850728 - Delores. You remember me?<br />- I remember you.
4850896 4854065 Can you tell me where I can find<br />the lovely Sergeant Murtaugh?
4854232 4858069 As a matter of fact, he's cowering down<br />on all fours right behind this counter.
4860656 4863824 - Listen, where's the sergeant?<br />- He's not here at the moment, Delores.
4863992 4866410 But, uh, he's talked of nothing<br />but you all week.
4866578 4868412 - Shut my mouth.<br />- The man's on fire.
4868580 4870623 - What's the matter, baby?<br />- A little sciatica.
4870791 4874001 Oh. You tell him Delores was here.
4874169 4876045 You tell that man...
4876213 4878255 ...that he's the jam in my jelly roll.
4879633 4883010 - I'll see you, baby, okay? Bye-bye.<br />- Okay. Bye.
4885263 4888140 Delores says that you're<br />the jam in her jelly roll. That's...
4888308 4890142 - I heard.<br />- Heh.
4890310 4892228 - That's a lot of woman there.<br />- Shit.
4892396 4896107 She calls me all the time. And she leaves<br />me notes. What am I gonna do?
4896274 4899777 - You shouldn't have led her on.<br />- Led her on? I didn't do anything, Riggs.
4899945 4903948 I mean, if Trish finds out about it...<br />I didn't... I didn't...
4904282 4906951 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4907119 4909745 You've gotta come see me.
4909913 4912164 Well, we gotta work. Come on. Let's go.
4912332 4915251 - Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />- Yeah. Thanks, doc.
4915502 4916752 - You're a beauty.<br />- Coming?
4916920 4918796 A beauty. Yeah, I'm coming.
4926388 4928305 Afternoon, captain.
4929975 4933102 - That's good, Murphy.<br />- See how easy that was?
4937107 4938858 I love it down here, don't you, Murph?
4939025 4943279 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4946992 4948826 Give me the lock-up keys.
4949369 4952163 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
4952330 4954331 And all busted by<br />the same police officer...
4954499 4956584 ...Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
4956752 4958502 Early paroles<br />on the work furlough program.
4958670 4962173 Uh-huh. Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4962340 4965092 Just a minute. You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4965260 4966510 - What?<br />- May I see your pass?
4966678 4968471 - Wanna see? Here's my pass.<br />- I do.
4968638 4971223 - I got shot in the line of duty, okay?<br />- He's with us.
4971391 4972933 - He's with us?<br />- Did I say that?
4973101 4976353 - Where'd you get her from?<br />- What are you doing out of the hospital?
4976521 4979023 Don't mention the hospital.<br />I told you not to leave me.
4979191 4981776 They tried to take my appendix.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4981943 4983903 - Brain surgery?<br />- No, a lapotomy.
4984070 4986363 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4986531 4987573 What's the difference?
4987741 4991827 The difference is, when you get a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4991995 4995164 - Nether what?<br />- Your nether... I can't say it in front of her.
4995332 4996791 Well, point to it.
4998251 4999543 - Okay. Here.<br />- Must be itchy.
4999711 5002129 Yes, it is itchy.<br />These doctors are savages.
5002297 5005382 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
5005550 5007051 Huh? Huh?
5008428 5010888 Yeah. With a telescope<br />big enough to see Venus.
5011056 5012723 I guess all they saw was Uranus, huh?
5012891 5015059 Oh, that's great. Huh-huh.<br />That's great. Thank you.
5015227 5016644 - You know what I say?<br />- What?
5016812 5020564 They fuck you in the hospital!<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you.
5020732 5021941 And when they're done...
5022108 5025194 ...along comes the insurance company,<br />and fucks you some more.
5025362 5028405 Ten dollars for a fucking aspirin,<br />that's not even covered.
5028573 5029865 - Leo!<br />- That's enough.
5030033 5031575 - We're trying to work here.<br />- Okay.
5031743 5034578 What's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5034746 5036330 You take an ad out in the paper?
5036498 5039083 - He's family. We gotta go somewhere else.<br />- Who's she?
5039251 5041377 - Sergeant Cole.<br />- Hey, how are you? Leo Getz.
5041545 5043254 Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?
5043421 5045381 - I get it.<br />- Real estate right now but...
5045549 5047883 Hey, listen. Come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
5048051 5050219 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
5050387 5051971 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5052138 5055432 That's great. I take one for you,<br />and that's what you tell me?
5055600 5058936 - He could check this out.<br />- That's all I'm good for? Takes slugs...
5059104 5061730 Leo, Leo, Leo. Look.<br />We got something for you to do.
5061898 5065401 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
5065569 5068279 - Okay. Sure, I can do this.<br />- Remember that name?
5068446 5070281 Right around... Mesa Verde, I got it.
5070448 5072783 What are you doing giving him<br />Mesa Verde?
5072951 5074785 If there's shit there, he'll dig it up.
5074953 5076829 - Who is that guy?<br />- It's a long story.
5083128 5084545 Here are your keys, captain.
5085964 5087673 - You motherfucker.<br />- Don't be stupid.
5087841 5090426 - The fuck?<br />- Take the elevator, bring the other guys.
5090594 5092386 Keys. Give me your fucking hands.
5093388 5096932 Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.
5097601 5099685 Stand there.
5103106 5105608 I can get faster results<br />than that real-estate broker.
5105775 5108527 Leo's not just a real-estate broker.
5108695 5111572 Yeah, he's a royal pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5112616 5116201 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator, guys.
5116369 5118704 - How'd you know where to find them?<br />- We got it all.
5118872 5120998 World of computers, Murph.<br />World of computers.
5121166 5123834 You used to be one of us,<br />for chrissakes, Jack.
5124002 5127087 You know what future<br />a cop has, Murph? None.
5127255 5130341 Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
5130592 5131884 Pension.
5132385 5133427 Nothing to do.
5133595 5137014 Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain<br />by evening. Well, not for this kid.
5137182 5139308 Police department's got it all:
5139476 5142645 Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.<br />It's a one-stop shopping center.
5142812 5146190 If you got the brains, there's not<br />a thing anybody can do about it.
5146358 5149026 You're already fucking history<br />and you know it.
5149194 5151528 Sorry, Murph.<br />But I'm just getting started.
5152030 5154031 - Something's wrong here.<br />- What?
5154199 5156659 The program's been accessed<br />by somebody from the outside.
5156826 5158327 What? What's been accessed?
5158495 5162081 After the guns were stolen, Internal Affairs<br />moved the confiscated ammunition.
5162248 5164458 - Armor-piercing bullets?<br />- Thousands of rounds...
5164626 5167211 ...to a more secured location. Shit.
5167379 5169254 - That's been accessed.<br />- Somebody knows.
5169422 5171632 Where's it stored?<br />Where did they move it?
5172968 5174468 - Wait, wait.<br />- Let's go.
5174636 5178097 - I guess I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.<br />- Where is it?
5178264 5179556 - In the building.<br />- Where?
5179724 5181475 - I'm showing you.<br />- Something going down?
5181643 5183602 - Nothing's going down.<br />- I'm going with you.
5183770 5185562 - Uh, how old are you?<br />- Twenty-two today.
5185730 5189066 Twenty-two? Come on.<br />You got protection?
5189234 5191986 - Right here in my wallet.<br />- No, your vest, you dummy.
5192153 5193237 Should we take him?
5193405 5195948 Okay, but keep your head down.<br />Keep your head down.
5196116 5197533 - Stay behind me.<br />- Come on, let's go.
5197701 5198909 - Yahoo!<br />- Shh! Quiet.
5211256 5212881 See, you were my ticket in, Murph.
5213466 5216093 It's too bad<br />you won't be coming with me.
5220223 5221473 Travis.
5221641 5223475 - They got it all.<br />- Shit.
5224185 5226145 - He's dead.<br />- How'd they get it out of here?
5226312 5228772 - I don't know.<br />- They didn't take it upstairs.
5228940 5230899 Hey, hey. Elevator.
5233486 5236113 - Shit. It's down.<br />- Hey, the subway's down there.
5236281 5238198 - We take the stairs.<br />- L.A. has subways?
5238366 5239408 Where you been, kid?
5239576 5241452 Read something besides the funny pages.
5242495 5244955 All right, guys. Come on, let's hustle.
5247500 5249293 Hurry up, guys.
5261973 5263390 L.A.P.D., guys. Come here.
5263558 5265434 Come here. Step on it.
5266061 5267728 Son of a bitch.
5267896 5269688 You see anybody, anything strange?
5269856 5274401 - Lots of cops and a bunch of boxes.<br />- Split now. Just get out of here.
5274819 5276487 - I'm going across.<br />- I got it.
5283578 5285370 Get rid of Murphy, now!
5291086 5293170 Where the fuck do you think you're going?<br />Let's go.
5305558 5306934 Split. Get out of here.
5308728 5310270 Cover me.
5316111 5317444 Riggs!
5330458 5332209 Let's go. Let's go!
5336089 5337965 Riggs.
5341469 5343387 Son, stay still.
5353398 5355524 Happy birthday, kid.
5365243 5366410 Oh, shit!
5381217 5382593 Another baby.
5394981 5396940 Hey! Is he dead? Check the body.
5397108 5398775 Get me the fuck out of here, will you?
5400445 5402237 Hey, Riggs! Hey, Riggs!
5402530 5404948 Riggs! You stupid son of a bitch.
5416878 5418962 Stop that shit. Cut it out.
5419130 5420964 - Hey! Don't shoot.<br />- L.A.P.D., man.
5421132 5422382 Where does this come out?
5422550 5423926 - Pico Station.<br />- Thanks, pal.
5424093 5425135 Hey, not that way.
5425303 5428055 - Take the stairs, man, it's faster.<br />- Okay, thanks.
5438858 5439983 Ow!
5440151 5442361 Sorry, pal. Where's the tunnel?<br />Gangway!
5450328 5452120 Get out of the way.
5455124 5457668 Holy shit. Son of a bitch.
5458503 5459711 Police!
5466678 5468762 Step on it! There he is! Step on it!
5470390 5471848 Goddamn.
5476688 5478647 Put your foot down!
5484696 5486363 I can't!
5505717 5509052 - Hey, police! I need your bike, man.<br />- What? This is bullshit.
5509220 5513682 I need your bike. Sergeant Riggs, call it in.<br />I need a couple clips too.
5529157 5530907 Hey, we lost him.
5538041 5540167 - Central, where's Riggs?<br />- Six-William-Six.
5540335 5542669 Central, keep me in touch<br />with motorcycle pursuit.
5550261 5551928 - Shit.<br />- Take a right, now.
5552096 5553513 Take a right! Go!
5554265 5556099 Go! Go! Go!
5557101 5559394 Stupid. Take a right. No, left!
5570948 5571948 Shit!
5576913 5578080 Oh, shit!
5594430 5596139 Watch it!
5600228 5602270 This is 6-William-6, this is 6-William-6.
5602438 5604147 I'm at the freeway construction site.
5604315 5607192 Where's Riggs? I'm here. Where's Riggs?<br />Come back to me, Central.
5607360 5609111 Six-William-Six, location west...
5609278 5610821 Where's Riggs? Where the hell is Riggs?
5612407 5614950 Take a left here. Get off.<br />Get off the freeway.
5616327 5617577 Oh, Jesus!
5627338 5628338 Stop! Hold it!
5630174 5631258 Oh, shit!
5632135 5633552 Hang on.
5635847 5637013 Stop!
5648776 5649818 Where is the pursuit?
5654115 5655532 Oh, shit.
5667920 5672048 - Riggs! Hey, just relax, Riggs.<br />- Relax?
5673801 5675010 Riggs! Riggs!
5675344 5677971 Oh, shit!
5684020 5685729 Riggs! Riggs!
5689358 5692569 Riggs. Hey, Riggs.
5692778 5694905 Get back. Just get back. Get back!
5695573 5697908 Riggs, talk to me. Riggs.
5698075 5700827 Riggs, you're alive. Come here.
5700995 5704080 Don't move. Don't move.<br />I said just get back!
5704916 5706249 You all right?
5708586 5710295 Hey, hey, hey, Riggs, don't...
5710463 5711838 Hey, hey, Riggs!
5713382 5714549 Don't touch me!
5714717 5717594 Okay, okay. I'm not touching you.<br />I'm not touching you.
5717762 5720013 - Just be careful.<br />- Don't touch me. Don't!
5724060 5726853 - Don't touch me.<br />- Hey, okay, I won't touch you.
5727021 5728188 I'm not touching you.
5730650 5735445 - Okay. You okay now?<br />- I'm pissed now, Rog. Now I'm pissed.
5735613 5737113 - Now what?<br />- That son of a bitch.
5737281 5739199 He's done it twice now. Damn.
5739367 5742244 Son of a... I'm gonna suck<br />his eyes out through his nose.
5742495 5744621 Twice he got away.<br />Nobody gets away from me!
5744789 5747624 Okay. Just relax. Just relax.
5747959 5749793 - Are you okay?<br />- Yeah, I'm okay.
5749961 5752462 - Are you okay?<br />- I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay.
5755174 5756466 Hey!
5757051 5758552 - Hey, I'm having that.<br />- You quit!
5758719 5760929 I ran out of biscuits, all right?<br />Give me a break.
5762640 5766476 Oh, shit.
5771148 5772315 Perfect.
5773401 5775569 - What did I miss?<br />- What's he doing here?
5775736 5777946 - What are you doing here?<br />- Great car chase.
5778114 5780073 - Great chase.<br />- What are you doing here?
5780241 5782075 - How'd you find us, huh?<br />- My police scanner.
5782243 5784244 What are you doing<br />with a police scanner?
5784412 5788748 What am I...? Hello, Car 54, where are you?<br />I cracked this case for you guys.
5788916 5791251 Listen. Mesa Verde's legit.
5791419 5793795 They got a housing project<br />called Rancho Arroyo.
5793963 5796423 - I know where that is.<br />- Why don't we check it out?
5796591 5799217 - Good idea.<br />- Okay, hey, wait. I'll come with you.
5799385 5802220 - No, you're not coming.<br />- Yes, I am. I'll take my car.
5802388 5804180 - No, you're not.<br />- Yes, I am.
5805933 5809060 I can't believe you did that.<br />I got a spare in the trunk.
5812023 5813690 - You're driving.<br />- No, I'm driving.
5813858 5816568 How could you do that?<br />I can't believe you did that.
5816736 5819195 - I can't believe you did that.<br />- Hey, where's Lorna?
5819363 5821531 - I can't believe you did that.<br />- With Walters.
5822199 5824951 I can't belie... I can't believe you did that.
5825119 5827287 How could you do that to me?
5828372 5830540 Did you see that? They're my partners.
5830708 5833376 - I can't believe they did that.<br />- Twenty-one and 18, clear.
5833544 5834878 Excuse me, do you own your home?
5868746 5871414 - Looks like we came to the right place.<br />- Yeah.
5871582 5873416 Move on out to Travis Town.
5873584 5875835 Great place to raise a family.
5876337 5878505 Built on guns and bloodshed.
5878673 5881383 One hell of a retirement plan<br />this asshole's got, isn't it?
5881550 5883927 Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.
5884512 5886971 - Say, is that, uh...?<br />- It's Darryl's gun.
5887139 5889808 - Saving it for the right occasion.<br />- This is the right occasion.
5889975 5891893 How many men you think he has?
5892061 5894437 Who knows? Maybe I should<br />run over there and ask him?
5894605 5896147 - That'd be too easy.<br />- Yeah.
5896357 5898441 Wish I had some grenades<br />or a rocket launcher.
5898609 5900402 Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
5900569 5903488 Hey, I wonder what Murphy's got<br />in his trunk.
5905783 5908243 Well, it's obvious Murph was<br />never a Boy Scout.
5908703 5910286 - Not even a good spare.<br />- Yeah.
5911956 5913289 Shit.
5914375 5916126 Put your hands down. It's embarrassing.
5919422 5921548 - How you doing?<br />- Kissing, huh?
5921716 5925051 - Fresh ones, huh?<br />- Oh, yeah. Shaving cuts.
5925219 5926511 Don't get points for those.
5926679 5928555 - How did you get here?<br />- Drove.
5928723 5931224 - No, no. How...?<br />- I ran into Leo at the police station.
5931392 5932934 - He talked to me first.<br />- Leo, Leo.
5933102 5935145 - Any ideas?<br />- Lucky thing we got a plan.
5935312 5937147 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah, lucky thing. What is it?
5937314 5942235 - Oh, no. I want it to be a surprise.<br />- Oh, I like surprises.

5950494 5953037 - Let's check it out.<br />- Let's go.
5969972 5972557 - Look what they did to Murph's car.<br />- Could've been worse.
5972725 5974976 - Could've been yours.<br />- Could've been Trish's.

5987531 5988656 Oh, shit!
5998834 6000794 - Go! Go! Let's go!<br />- Yeah, yeah.
6008511 6011012 What's wrong with you?<br />I said go on three, not two.
6011180 6012555 - Nobody goes on two.<br />- On three!
6012723 6014891 - Three. It's always three.<br />- Boys! Boys!
6016143 6018436 What are we doing here?<br />Losing our heads in a crisis?

6051387 6054097 - What?<br />- Count to 20, then light me!
6058602 6059936 Shit!
6062273 6064065 Riggs, it's loaded with ammo.
6077997 6079455 - Cover me.<br />- Cover you?
6081208 6083042 Cover you, cover Riggs.<br />Cover everybody.
6083210 6085795 When's somebody gonna cover me<br />for a change?
6090593 6093052 What's that, 13, 14? Ah, to hell with it.
6109486 6112155 Jack, it's the cops.<br />They're burning everything.
6115618 6116659 God!
6123709 6126544 Son of a bitch. Shit. Crazy motherfucker!
6130716 6133676 Damn. Riggs, the ammo.<br />Get out of there.
6150194 6154155 - Riggs, you crazy son of a bitch.<br />- Yeah! Ha, ha!
6169672 6171506 Son of a bitch. It works. Shit.
6176053 6179722 Stay there. That shit works, Riggs.<br />Riggs!
6193278 6194404 Son of a bitch. No clip.
6197366 6199075 Lorna, no, don't!
6205749 6207083 Come on in, bitch.
6207751 6209585 - Door's open.<br />- Aah!

6313524 6316234 Riggs! Hey, Riggs. Riggs!
6318737 6322740 Riggs! Get up! Get up, Riggs!<br />Get up! Get up!
6323117 6324700 Killed in the line of duty, Riggs!
6329164 6332041 You'll get a great funeral<br />from the department, Riggs!
6337381 6339715 Hey, Riggs. Cop killers.
6351854 6353396 Ex-cop killers.
6363866 6365575 Go to hell, Riggs.
6366910 6368286 You first.
6377171 6379922 Hey, Riggs! Crazy son of a bitch.
6386138 6388639 Sorry, honey, I gotta do it. I gotta look.
6388807 6390808 Oh. Oh.
6390976 6392935 Just hold still. Hold still.
6393103 6395146 Hey, get a chopper, man. Get a chopper.
6395439 6397523 She had two vests on.<br />She's gonna be okay.
6397691 6399901 A couple of bad ones.<br />We need to get a chopper.
6400068 6403946 Okay. You're all right, partner.<br />You're all right. All right. Hang on. Okay.
6404573 6407533 It's okay, it's okay.<br />Just lie still. Just lie still.
6407701 6410912 Just a romantic evening<br />by the fire, just the two of us.
6411163 6412371 Just be still.
6415667 6419128 - Lock and load!<br />- I got it.
6422424 6424926 Honey, open your eyes. Open your eyes.
6425594 6427136 Open your eyes.
6430641 6432642 What are you trying to prove<br />out there, huh?
6433018 6434435 Huh? Why do you do that?
6435103 6436854 - Can I take this off?<br />- Yeah.
6438899 6440858 You're supposed to grow old<br />with someone...
6441026 6442652 ...not because of them, all right?
6448784 6450159 I'm gonna be with you, Lorna.
6450953 6452954 Hey, I'm with you now.<br />Look, I'm right here.
6453121 6455164 We're both here, right? Right.
6457042 6459001 Come on, I wanna be with you.
6459169 6461045 What have you got to lose?
6461964 6463005 You.
6465133 6466467 Not likely.
6471932 6474141 - Hey, Lorna.<br />- Yeah?
6476395 6478479 Let's live to regret this, huh?
6482401 6484443 - Okay, we've gotta go, sarge.<br />- Okay.
6484987 6486696 She's gonna be fine.
6490409 6491826 Can you hear me?
6493328 6494370 I love you.
6511972 6515975 Happy retirement, Daddy
6516893 6520771 Happy retirement, Daddy
6521231 6523399 This is it. This is the day.
6524276 6525359 Everybody? Daddy?
6525527 6528654 I want you to know there's a candle<br />for every year in the force.
6528822 6530614 - Yes. A lot of years.<br />- That's a lot.
6530782 6532783 - Come on, you have to blow it out.<br />- Come on.
6532951 6535536 - Blow them out.<br />- Blow them out. Come on.
6535704 6537079 - I can't.<br />- Come on, we'll help.
6537247 6541042 - No, that's not what I mean.<br />- What?
6541543 6543419 I can't retire.
6544463 6546630 I thought I could. I wanted to.
6548050 6549592 But I can't.
6553430 6555431 That means you're gonna<br />stay with the force?
6555599 6557767 That means I'm staying<br />with the force, baby.
6561146 6565274 This cake's about to explode,<br />so, uh, you better blow out these candles.
6565442 6569153 But, um, Dad, I want you to know<br />that I'm behind you all the way.
6569821 6571697 - Yeah, me too.<br />- So am I, Dad.
6571865 6574116 - It's okay.<br />- Well, the streets will be safer...
6574284 6575368 ...for another couple years.
6578205 6580915 - Word, Nick.<br />- Word, Dad.
6584002 6585544 Blow them out.
6586588 6587755 Hello?
6587923 6590132 - Hello. Up here!<br />- Hello?
6590300 6593719 - Hello. Hey, I gotta talk to Roger.<br />- Leo.
6593887 6594970 Oprah should see this.
6595138 6597640 I can't believe this. Okay, this is great.
6597808 6599266 Leo, what is it?
6599434 6602436 Where's Riggs? I didn't know<br />he could hold his breath that long.
6602604 6604647 - Okay, okay.<br />- I'm taking a bath, Leo.
6604815 6607775 I can see that. And it's cold water too.<br />There goes your image.
6607943 6610861 - Leo.<br />- Listen, I got great news, okay?
6611029 6614198 Okay? Once again,<br />Leo Getz has delivered.
6614366 6616492 Okay, I have sold this turkey.
6617369 6621789 This termite-infested dump<br />is now gone. Okay?
6621957 6625334 You have to sign the contract<br />before the suckers change their mind.
6625502 6626710 Okay? I did it. I did it.
6626878 6628337 - Hey, hey. Leo, Leo.<br />- What?
6628505 6630005 The house is off the market.
6630173 6634135 We're gonna stay in this termite-infested<br />turkey for another 10 years.
6634302 6636262 - At least.<br />- I'll get married in here.
6636430 6638931 - Come on, you guys. Come on, out.<br />- You can't do this.
6639099 6640891 - Out, out.<br />- No, you can't do that.
6641059 6643686 - You too, Leo.<br />- You can't do that.
6643854 6645020 I have contracts signed.
6645188 6647440 Because we're partners,<br />no commission. Okay?
6647607 6651152 - Partners?<br />- You and Riggs owe me two new tires.
6651319 6652361 - Why?<br />- Why?
6652529 6655197 Bullets aren't covered in normal<br />road hazard. That's why.
6655365 6659034 - I want those tires! No conditions!<br />- Oh, God. Leo, get out of here.
6659202 6661704 - Don't tell me to get out!<br />- Get out. Leo, out, out!
6661872 6663998 You're lucky your wife's here.<br />You're lucky...
6664166 6665207 - Out!<br />- Okay.
6668420 6670713 - Don't come to me if the...<br />- Get out!
6670881 6673757 - Termites get... Okay, okay.<br />- No more!
6676261 6679054 - Your friends.<br />- Yeah.
6679514 6682433 Ten more years<br />till forced retirement, huh, baby?
6683602 6687771 That's, uh, 3650 days.
6687939 6690733 - Forty-nine.<br />- Oh, yeah.
6701536 6703621 - I'll try and improve my image.<br />- Mm.
6710545 6714423 - See you soon. Thanks a lot.<br />- Don't mention it.
6714591 6716592 Oh, bye, Daddy.
6718929 6720429 Bye, baby.
6729606 6732149 - What are you smiling at?<br />- Heh.
6732317 6735486 - Why weren't you at my party, huh?<br />- I knew you weren't gonna retire.
6735654 6739406 I've been wrong about a couple things<br />in my life, but I knew you wouldn't retire.
6739574 6741742 Well, I knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6741910 6744537 I'm smoking to take my mind off<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6744704 6747748 - What dog-biscuit problem?<br />- I've been chasing more cars lately...
6747916 6750960 ...and, uh, when I try and lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.
6751461 6755256 Jesus Christ. Hey, hey, hey.<br />I'm driving. Other side.
6755423 6758342 I got no dispute. I just came over<br />to open the door for you.
6758510 6760010 Thank you for opening the door.
6760178 6763681 - Need some help? An old fella like you...<br />- I'll show you a fella my age.
6763848 6765683 - Who's a grumpy bastard?<br />- I'm a grumpy bastard.
6767102 6768644 - You know something, Riggs?<br />- What?
6768812 6772565 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.
6773108 6776652 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.
6776820 6778153 Well, he did it to me.
6779239 6780656 I know.
6781408 6782866 See what I mean?
6784995 6788247 - My point, exactly.<br />- Son of a bitch. Shit.
6791543 6793043 Stay away from my daughter.
6793211 6795504 - You can't be serious.<br />- What are you talking about?
6795672 6797506 I saw what it was. You kissed Rianne.
6797674 6799508 She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6799676 6802636 - That's not the point.<br />- It was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6802804 6805431 If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
6805599 6808642 - Getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />- I'm getting enough fiber.
6808810 6810185 I'm spoken for, okay?
6810353 6812980 I'm gonna pick Lorna up<br />from the hospital this afternoon.
6813148 6815024 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah, we're practically...
6815191 6817610 - You're serious?<br />- We got a dog and everything.
6817777 6820404 I figure I can, uh, you know,<br />make ends meet.
6829039 6832207 All units. All units. Code 2, high.
6832375 6835002 Hey, don't even think<br />about it, Riggs. Don't even try.
6835170 6838297 This is us, rolling to Code 2, high,<br />at Verrina Place.
6838465 6841258 - Shit, Riggs.<br />- This time we wait for the bomb squad.
6841426 6844011 You think I want to end up<br />in uniform again?
7026611 7030781 20-William-12,<br />the REA bomb squad's en route. All units.
7030949 7032741 Those guys gonna get in the way again?
7032909 7035702 Okay, there it is. You happy? Let's go.
7035870 7037871 Ah, we ain't seen nothing yet, though, Rog.
7038039 7040582 - Come on, just get me up there closer.<br />- It's roped off.
7040750 7043126 - Can't see the bomb squad.<br />- They're coming.
7043294 7046255 - Okay, all right. All right.<br />- Stop here and I'll just get out.
7046422 7049174 No, don't get out<br />of the car, Riggs. No. Riggs!
7049342 7051635 Tell me, Rog, was it red wire, blue...?
7051886 7054096 Let's get out of here!<br />Step on the gas.
7054264 7055681 They'll never believe this.
7055849 7058433 - I hope nobody saw us.<br />- They'll blame me.
7058601 7061854 Let's keep cool. You better get<br />your girdle out of mothballs.
7062021 7063856 They'll say, "Back in uniform again. "
7064023 7066650 - Find one that fits.<br />- Ten more years of this.
7066818 7069778 I'm too old for this shit.
