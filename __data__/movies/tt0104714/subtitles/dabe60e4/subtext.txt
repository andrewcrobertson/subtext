101809 103101 Riggs, Homicide.
103269 104853 - Nobody's dead.<br />- Night's young.
105020 106520 This is Sergeant Murtaugh.
106688 108230 -Threat or scare?<br />-The real thing.
108398 109815 This gentleman saw the device.
109983 113110 On Level 1 , near the gas pumps.<br />I wrote the license plate down.
113278 114945 That's okay, sir. Thanks a lot.
115113 117239 -Have you evacuated the building?<br />-lt's clean.
117407 118824 -Bomb squad?<br />-On their way.
118992 121159 -lt's under control. Let's go.<br />-Bomb squad?
121326 123202 Rog, I think we ought to check this out.
123370 125830 -Hey. Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />-What?
126206 128332 -Bomb squad's on their way.<br />-There's no bomb.
128500 130960 -How can you be sure?<br />-Because it's a full moon.
131128 133337 Moon, lunar, lunatics.<br />They're everywhere.
133505 135173 -Hey, is that Greek?<br />-No, no. Latin.
135340 137507 Latin. Man, you surprise<br />the shit out of me.
137675 139885 There's no bomb.<br />It's probably a false alarm.
140052 142345 It happens. Probably saw<br />a radio on the back seat.
142513 145265 Hey, hey. Let's not mess with this.<br />Wait for the bomb squad.
145433 147642 You're right.<br />You sit tight, I'll be right back.
147810 150395 -Hey, hey, hey, Riggs.<br />-What's the matter with you?
150563 152813 -There's a bomb in that building.<br />-There's not.
152981 154607 -There's a bomb!<br />-There is not.
154775 157276 There's a bomb in that building!<br />Know how come I know?
157444 159320 -How?<br />-l got eight days to retirement.
159488 161322 And l will not make a stupid mistake.
161490 162573 There is no bomb.
162741 166535 I will bet vital parts of my anatomy<br />to the fact. Now, look. Look.
166703 169078 Trust me. Okay? Trust me.
172583 174876 That's usually my first mistake.
175544 177003 -Hey, Riggs.<br />- Yo.
177171 178713 Hey, wait. l'm coming.
178881 180215 - Hey, Rog?<br />- Yeah?
180382 182926 - Your insurance paid up?<br />- Yeah, of course. Why?
183384 187012 - There could be a bomb in here.<br />- Oh, God.
188890 189932 I hate it when I'm right.
191309 194561 -You ought to learn to trust your instincts.<br />-Oh, God.
194729 197356 First impression<br />can often be the right one.
198691 202151 Leak in his diff. About to drop his<br />drive shaft. No wonder there's a bomb.
202319 204111 Just don't touch it.
205447 206906 Just looking.
208116 209700 Right.
212246 215914 What are you gonna do?<br />Don't open the door. Don't open the door!
220086 221586 Son of a bitch, just look at it.
221754 224589 -Just look at it.<br />-That's all I'm gonna do, is look.
227343 229678 Oh, my. There's more plastic than Cher.
229971 233430 I love this job. This is amateur night.<br />Open the door. l can't hear you.
233849 235432 Open the door.
235809 237142 Don't do nothing.
238436 240062 Not that one! Mm-mm!
240230 241522 You son of a bitch.
241690 244859 Well, this is a pretty shonky job.<br />I can dismantle it.
245026 247694 It looks like Beirut to me.<br />Let's get the hell out of here.
251448 254617 Everybody's outside. Just me, you<br />and this cat are dumb enough to be here.
254785 257036 Nearly a cat-tastrophe, huh? Heh.
257997 260999 -Relax, Rog. Relax. Right.<br />-Don't do nothing.
261166 263125 We got nine minutes<br />and seven seconds left.
263293 264793 -Know what we could do?<br />-What?
264961 267838 -We could drive this out.<br />-Fine, it's your turn to drive.
268006 269882 No keys. Tsk, tsk. l could hot-wire it.
270049 273302 Aah! Don't even say "hot-wire"<br />around this stuff, man.
273469 276555 -You're right, you're right.<br />-Why am l doing this? Why am I--?
276723 279724 Looks like we're gonna have to do it<br />the old-fashioned way.
279892 284312 Riggs, what are you thinking?<br />What are you thinking, Riggs? Riggs.
284479 286731 -l'm thinking we should cut the blue wire.<br />-Wait!
286899 288816 -That's not what I think.<br />-You think red?
288984 290234 No. No.
290402 292861 I'm thinking that it's<br />eight minutes and 42 seconds.
293029 296615 We can go upstairs, wait for<br />the bomb squad, have a cappuccino.
296782 300410 The bomb squad never gets here on time.<br />It's eight minutes and 31 seconds.
300578 302913 -Rog, please.<br />-Forget the cappuccino.
303080 306416 -You know what they're gonna say?<br />-"Get the fuck out of here."
306584 310377 After that, they're gonna say, "Cut the<br />blue wire," which l'm gonna do right now.
310921 313130 -Hey, hey. Wait, wait. Riggs. Wait.<br />-What?
313298 315549 -How can you be so sure?<br />-Oh, it's just a hunch.
315717 317927 -A hunch?<br />-Remember the bomb under your toilet?
318094 321180 -Oh, shit. How could l forget?<br />-Red wire, blue wire, same thing.
321348 324557 This is more simplified.<br />A bit more powerful, but more simplified.
324725 328102 -From where l was sitting, l couldn't see.<br />-Forget it. Come on, trust me.
328270 329520 Yeah, so I gotta trust you?
329688 332440 Guess not.<br />Well, l'm cutting the red wire, okay?
332608 334776 Oh! Oh!
334944 338363 -What? What?<br />-A minute ago you said blue.
339198 341615 -Did l say blue?<br />-Riggs, you said blue.
342116 343533 -Well, l meant red.<br />-You sure?
343868 345577 We can do it your way if you'd like.
345745 347871 -My way? l don't have--!<br />-Quiet!
348039 351375 -l'm sure, okay?<br />-Shit.
353336 355169 You ready?
355337 357046 -Rog?<br />-What?
357547 360758 Won't you kind of miss all this good stuff<br />when you retire?
360926 363719 Aren't you gonna miss it a little bit? Huh?
365764 367181 I'm cutting the wire.
367975 369016 Snip. See? All done.
371644 373520 -Rog.<br />-Yeah?
374730 377315 -Grab the cat.<br />-Grab the cat?
377483 380402 Get back! Take cover!
440333 441792 Where are they?
447257 448673 Bravo.
453637 454971 Oops.
456515 458183 Right. Oops.
460644 462520 Right.
467525 470527 Seven days to retirement,<br />I'm busted down to patrolman.
470695 473155 I should've cut the red wire.
473323 475407 -You did.<br />-No, I didn't. l cut the blue wire.
475575 478660 That's what l meant.<br />We should've waited for the bomb squad.
478828 480495 Am l gonna have to listen to this?
480662 483206 -Every day until l retire.<br />-That'll be a week too long.
483373 484665 Ah, shit.
484833 487085 -My feet are killing me.<br />-They're killing me too.
487252 489670 -How?<br />-l gotta listen to you bitch about them!
489838 494217 -Because you should've cut the red wire!<br />-l did cut the red wire!
494760 497969 What's this? lt's kind of soft.<br />It's not a bulletproof vest.
498137 501014 -lt's not gonna keep anything out.<br />-Gonna keep my stomach in.
501390 503350 What do you got under there?
503851 506269 -lt's a girdle.<br />-What?
506771 508730 Oh, God. lt's a girdle.

510982 512775 Not a woman's girdle, a man's girdle.
512943 515486 -They make girdles for men?<br />-They make girdles for men.
515654 516987 -They do, huh?<br />-Yeah, they do.
517155 520366 I haven't worn this uniform in 15 years.<br />Cleaners must have shrunk it.
520534 522076 Well, you should take it to Chin.
522244 525287 I did take it to Chin over in Alpine.<br />Look at it. It's shrunk all up in here.
527081 529040 -Have to hold my breath.<br />-Did you see that?
529208 531543 -See what?<br />-Jaywalker.

1166303 1168930 -Uh, wasn't that Darryl?<br />-Yeah.
1169098 1170974 Haven't seen him around in a while.
1172059 1175478 -He dropped out of school.<br />-Those are pretty gang colors he's wearing.

1193621 1196331 -Word, Riggs.<br />-Word, Rog.
1196999 1198541 -What are we talking about?<br />-Word.
1198709 1201002 Starts with a W,<br />"or" in the middle, D on the end.
1201170 1203254 -Word. Oh, yeah, that word.<br />-Where you been?
1203422 1205840 -Word.<br />-Word.
1219145 1222189 - Hey, Tyrone, my man, how are you?<br />- Jack, how's it going?
1222356 1224441 -Let's take a walk.<br />-Hey, wait here for me.
1224609 1227360 Look around. This is my dream<br />and it's all coming true.
1227528 1231280 You sank your money into this, out here<br />in the middle of the fucking desert?
1231448 1233699 That's right.<br />Know why it's gonna be a gold mine?
1233867 1234909 Do tell me.
1235076 1238579 Because nobody wants to live next door<br />to people like you. You're a menace.
1238747 1241999 Jack, I came out here to do business,<br />not be insulted by you.
1242167 1243501 Relax, Tyrone.
1243667 1246169 Just like houses,<br />friendships need strong foundations.
1246337 1249714 Hey, Smitty, come here. Come here.
1251634 1254886 What's wrong with you? Don't l<br />pay you good? Don't l take care of you?
1255054 1256054 Sure you do, Jack.
1256222 1258807 What's this stupid business<br />you and Billy tried to pull?
1258974 1262351 -lt was a good plan. It worked.<br />-lt worked? It didn't work.
1262519 1263894 You got nailed first time out.
1264062 1266730 Nobody who works for me<br />goes into business for themselves.
1266898 1268190 Understand what l'm saying?
1268358 1270567 See how that can jeopardize everything?<br />Right, Tyrone?
1270735 1272152 Heh, heh, whatever.
1272320 1274738 Especially trying to pop an armored car.
1275322 1278825 Okay, Billy got caught.<br />There's nothing I can do about that now.
1278992 1281619 He's gonna have to face the music<br />on his own.
1281912 1285039 But you and me, Smitty,<br />we're gonna start over.
1285207 1286958 You know what l mean?
1287918 1289752 -Whatever you say, Jack.<br />-Good.
1289920 1291920 Glad you understand<br />what I'm talking about.
1298719 1300929 Now we got a relationship<br />we can build on.
1303266 1306433 -Employee problems. You know how it is?<br />-Yeah, right.
1306601 1309520 You invest time and energy<br />into training somebody.
1309688 1312898 They get greedy and do something stupid<br />that jeopardizes everything.
1313149 1314358 It's a bitch.
1314776 1316694 Stick around. This is the good part.
1317112 1320406 We can put our initials in there. Yeah?
1320574 1322282 Jesus Christ.
1325661 1327871 - Lankershim and Vineland.<br />- Where are we going, Rog?
1328038 1332292 Uh, right here. Rianne's got<br />a new job. l promised her I'd stop by.
1332459 1334002 That's a good reason.
1334837 1337671 All right. Here we are.
1343553 1346847 -You got any silver, any change?<br />-We're cops.
1347015 1349892 That's right, we're cops. Not crooks.<br />I'll get change.
1359735 1362820 - Where are you going? Get down!<br />- Get down! All of you, get down!
1376667 1378877 Riggs! Riggs!
1384049 1387009 How do you like that, huh?<br />What are you doing with a rubber gun?
1387177 1389553 -No! This is a film. There are not--<br />-What?
1389721 1392765 Cut, cut, cut!<br />Who the fuck is this lunatic?
1392933 1395225 -Get him off my set.<br />- This isn't part of the story.
1395393 1397686 - Can we get a cop?<br />- Where did you come from?
1397854 1399188 Jesus. Who are you?
1399356 1402482 Rianne, l'm so sorry.<br />I feel like a microbe right now.
1402650 1404943 -You really thought l was in trouble?<br />- Oh, I did.
1405110 1407946 -You did?<br />-A real cop. Go sit in your fucking trailer.
1408113 1409989 What is wrong with you?<br />Are you an idiot?
1410157 1411199 I apologize.
1411367 1415160 -He's a friend of mine, a policeman.<br />-Yeah, we're both here to visit--
1415328 1416578 Oh, he's a friend of yours?
1416746 1420540 Let me tell you something, okay?<br />You're fired. All right. Have a nice day.
1420708 1422542 Fired? Riggs, what did you do?
1423378 1427172 -You're not fired. Don't worry.<br />-No, you're not. Take it easy, Riggs.
1427340 1429174 You can't fire her for something I did.
1429342 1431509 I don't care whose mistake it was.<br />She's fired.
1431677 1434387 - l apologize to everybody.<br />-Don't push him.
1434554 1435888 -Don't push.<br />-All of you, go!
1436056 1438182 Just take it easy.<br />Don't push him. Don't push.
1438350 1441227 - Get off my set, all right?<br />- What are you, deaf? Go.
1441395 1442603 Move. Get off my set.
1442771 1444897 On any normal day,<br />I'd smack you in the mouth.
1445065 1446982 -ls that so?<br />-Don't hit him.
1447149 1448441 It's a normal day.
1449694 1451945 I'm sorry. Listen, are you okay?<br />I'm sorry.
1452113 1455323 God, I'm all thumbs. Look, he fell down.<br />Let me help you up.
1455491 1457033 I said don't hit him, Riggs.
1457201 1459077 - ls she fired?<br />- Yes, she's fired.
1459245 1460328 -ls she fired?<br />-No.
1460496 1462329 - She got a raise?<br />-lt's all right.
1462497 1464415 -Yes. I said yes. Thank you.<br />-Good.
1464582 1468585 -Rianne, l think you have a new friend here.<br />-Yeah.
1468920 1470504 We'd like you to come back.
1472215 1473590 All right.
1475552 1477677 You can't settle every problem<br />with your fists.
1477845 1480638 -l couldn't use my gun. There was a crowd.<br />-Okay, six more days.
1480806 1482598 Look, l don't wanna hear that anymore.
1482766 1485935 Hey, did Rianne get her job back?<br />Did she get a raise? Did she?
1486103 1487895 I don't hear a "thank you."
1488063 1491524 Maybe I should, uh, become one of those<br />Hollywood agents. What do you think?
1491692 1494151 -Hmm. Won't work.<br />-Why?
1494318 1498572 -You gotta have killer instinct.<br />-Heh. Son of a bitch.
1498781 1502659 -We should've put the bag on the meter.<br />-Put it in the glove compartment.
1502827 1505787 -No, no. I don't do that anymore.<br />-Oh, yeah? Good man.
1505955 1508290 No, it's full up already.<br />Put it in the back seat.
1512377 1515504 -You really like those things, huh?<br />-What, these? Yeah, it's good.
1518300 1521594 Hey, you know, you can eat a box of them.<br />I'm still dying for a cigarette.
1524972 1528099 -What, you cut yourself shaving?<br />-Yeah.
1528267 1531936 -Old razor?<br />-Old face.
1533522 1537275 I think you're really letting this<br />retirement thing get you down, Rog.
1537443 1540611 Why don't you spend a couple<br />more years, think it over. Why quit?
1540779 1542988 -l got plans for my retirement.<br />-Yeah, plans.

1566345 1568554 I've given it a lot of thought, Riggs.
1587531 1589240 Goddamn it!

1590742 1592368 I'm pissed off! You need a reason?
1592536 1593786 I thought I heard gunfire.
1593954 1596038 Get your hearing checked. Put that away.
1596665 1600209 -What are you looking at?<br />-Hey, man. Peace.
1621521 1626191 - Riggs, why'd you call us down here?<br />-Everybody, it's all right.

1948034 1949869 - That's classified.<br />- I'm talking to him.
1950036 1952663 - Bullshit!<br />-Murtaugh. Hey, hey. Riggs!
1954458 1957626 Look, maybe these guys<br />can contribute something to this case.
1957794 1961254 From their records, the only thing<br />they contribute is mayhem and chaos.
1961422 1963590 I'm Chaos and he's Mayhem.<br />We're a double act.
1963757 1967135 -Are we required reading or something?<br />-As a matter of fact, you are.
1967303 1970346 It's a cross between Police Gazette<br />and Mad magazine.
1970514 1973016 -What's wrong with Mad?<br />- Nothing, l used to read it.
1973184 1976352 -Oh, yeah, you've got some good taste.<br />-When l was 12.
1976519 1979229 -When you-- Yeah.<br />-Hey, hey. Riggs, let's go.

1996705 1998915 - God.<br />- No. You're Murtaugh and l'm Riggs.

2008007 2010258 -Yeah, right.<br />-And get a haircut.
2010426 2013803 -Of course l won't.<br />-You just exceeded your authority, captain.
2013971 2016348 -That's not the way l see it.<br />-The chief will.
2016516 2018558 -Well, take it up with him.<br />- l think l will.
2018726 2020268 We don't want this screwed up.
2020436 2023687 You're gonna have to get him<br />between lunches. Son of a bitch.
2026399 2027942 Hi, Billy.
2030362 2033113 -Jack.<br />-Bye, Billy.

2048546 2050547 Sergeant, did you get what you need?
2050714 2053299 Not really. lt's a dead issue, l'm afraid.
2054968 2057052 How long has Phelps been doing this?
2057220 2060013 - Doing what?<br />-His armored-car thing.
2060181 2063308 - I wouldn't know.<br />- I'm not interested in armored cars.
2076572 2078531 I don't think she's telling us everything.
2078699 2080032 Yeah, l think you're right.
2080200 2082994 Boy, these six days is gonna be rough.
2083161 2085704 God, be good to me, please.
2087123 2089749 Shit, son of a bitch knew<br />there was a camera in the wall.
2089917 2091751 Look how he's covering up.
2091919 2093712 -Damn it.<br />- Didn't know there was one...
2093879 2095171 ...in the interrogation room.
2095339 2096673 -There isn't.<br />-Yeah.
2097550 2098967 Installed them six months ago.
2099135 2100969 -Every station.<br />- That's great.
2101137 2103137 Six months, and we don't know about it?
2103305 2105347 This is the police police, captain.
2105515 2108976 "Police police." Can you say<br />that three times in a row, real fast?
2109144 2111353 -Am I getting to you?<br />- You trying to bait me?
2111521 2114023 -l'm a master of it.<br />-Well, that figures.
2114190 2117025 Hey, heh, baiting master. Great.<br />I'll try that on Trish.
2117192 2120403 Freeze that. Stop it. Jack Travis.
2120571 2124449 - Who?<br />-Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
2124950 2126326 He was one of us.
2126493 2129329 Hell of a brutal cop.<br />Could beat a confession out of anyone.
2129496 2130705 One hell of a dirty cop.
2130873 2134583 Never seen so many suspensions and<br />reprimands and charges of misconduct.
2134751 2137377 Well, he's also as tough as they come.
2137837 2140047 -What happened to him?<br />-l don't know.
2140214 2143717 His partner and him were on a stakeout.<br />He went for coffee, never came back.
2143885 2146553 Looks like he's had<br />one cappuccino too many.
2146721 2148220 We better brief Walters.
2149181 2151223 Excuse me, cute stuff.
2151391 2153684 -That's harassment.<br />-"Cute stuff." That's you.
2154645 2158314 -Captain.<br />-Boys, boys. Just the captain.
2158482 2161901 Your involvement in this case ended<br />when Billy Phelps hit the floor.
2162069 2164819 Why don't you go back<br />and beat your street?
2164987 2166029 Really good work.
2166197 2168156 - Now's the time to buy.<br />- Leo, Not now.
2168324 2170283 -Hey, Roger, Roger.<br />- Not now, Leo.
2170451 2173244 -No, no. Not now.<br />-We gotta talk, babe, okay?
2173412 2175288 You're in trouble. You got termites.
2175456 2176706 -Termites?<br />-Uh-huh.
2176874 2178958 -Oh, God.<br />-You're infested.
2179125 2181418 The only thing holding up your house<br />is the paint.
2181586 2184755 Rog, I think we should go.<br />Leo, could you get the place fumigated?
2184923 2187508 We should go to Evidence,<br />pull every file on this guy.
2187676 2189968 I know this guy.<br />What are you watching, Geraldo?
2190136 2191387 -What?<br />-l know the guy.
2191554 2193764 -How do you know him?<br />-l've seen the guy before.

2196433 2199394 His name's Jack Travis, Leo.<br />Does that ring a bell? Jack Travis.
2199561 2202313 Hey, hey, hey.<br />Hands off the clothes. Okay, baby?
2202481 2205191 -Okay, I'm thinking. Let me think. Okay.<br />-Think.
2205359 2206984 -A big party.<br />- Okay.
2207152 2210570 Somebody brought a monkey because<br />the monkey knocked over the salad bar.
2210738 2213782 And this guy comes in,<br />introduced me to another guy...
2213950 2215992 ...who wants a favor.
2216160 2217869 -l got it. l got it. l got it!<br />-What?
2218037 2218870 He got it.
2219163 2221164 -l remember! I remember!<br />-You remember!
2221332 2224292 Hey, don't do it.<br />Don't let the earring fool you.

2226795 2228129 -All right. Listen.<br />-Yeah.
2228296 2229922 Think l could get a gun this time?
2230090 2231549 No!
2240851 2245687 Okay, this is it. See, these guys always<br />wanted me to do favors for them.
2245855 2249733 Like, some guys wanted broads,<br />another guy wanted Cuban cigars.
2249900 2254195 Your guy, hockey.<br />The best seats in the house.
2256157 2259032 -Where's the seats?<br />-Yeah.
2259200 2261952 Uh, probably by the glass.<br />Around the glass.
2262120 2264371 Does "needle in a haystack"<br />mean anything to you?
2264539 2266039 Why don't we spread out?
2266207 2270627 You know, if we all take a different<br />direction, it'd be like old times.
2270795 2273755 Don't push, lady.<br />I'm on police business here.
2273922 2275882 Just take it easy, now.

2543341 2545009 -Yeah.<br />- You should rest up, Leo.
2545176 2546593 A dumdum wound can be serious.
2547262 2548846 What's a dumdum wound?
2549389 2553391 You don't know? A guy got his thumb<br />shot off by a dumdum.
2553559 2555601 From the shock,<br />he was dead two days later.

2603397 2605815 -Relax. They'll be there when you get out.<br />- I'm fine.
2605983 2608276 -You own your own house, doc?<br />-What?
2608444 2610361 -You don't recognize my face?<br />- No, sir.
2610529 2611821 Watch.
2612531 2615949 About time. These doggy treats<br />are okay, but l need some human food.
2616117 2617159 Don't worry.
2617327 2620788 I'm about to make you one of the best<br />things you ever had in your life.
2621164 2625584 -Hey, you ever eat one of my hamburgers?<br />-l've been lucky so far. l'll take a chance.

2640182 2643643 - No, because it's Wednesday.<br />- Too big to argue with.
2644228 2646312 In that case, give me a McRog.
2646480 2648396 -Hold the hair.<br />-Heh, heh.
2648564 2649606 You wash your hands?

2653569 2657364 And you're gonna come back<br />with your friends.
2657532 2661159 I haven't got any friends,<br />you know that, Rog. Well, except you.
2661327 2663035 He's a comedian in his spare time.

2681554 2683555 I was only looking at it.
2685516 2688226 Ah. First thing is the fat.
2688394 2690895 Everybody says, "Cut the fat."
2691063 2693730 My uncle said,<br />"You cut the fat, you kill the burger."
2693898 2695649 - Yep.<br />- There's an art to this.
2695817 2697860 You just can't plop this on the grill.
2700905 2703699 Gently coax the flavors out.
2705326 2706910 - Yo, hey.<br />-What's the problem?
2714209 2717587 A little pepper,<br />then you massage it a little bit.
2717754 2721382 Just a little bit. Sweet, sweet meat.

2880741 2881906 It's okay. You okay?
2882867 2884576 It's not okay.
2884910 2887579 -What?<br />-l know that kid.
2889915 2891207 I know that kid.
2892752 2894753 He's Nick's friend.
2912436 2914395 - Got it, Mom.<br />- l'll get it.
2914563 2917774 Hello? Hi, Martin.
2918192 2919692 He's not here.
2926992 2929076 Oh, my God.
2931662 2933288 Thanks.
2962233 2964150 Fuck. Fuck.
2970032 2971825 How you doing? Taking your vitamins?
2971992 2974119 -Riggs, how's Murtaugh?<br />-He's good. He's fine.
2974286 2975661 Morning, captain.
2975829 2978831 -l'm sure he's anything but fine.<br />-Really, he's okay.
2978998 2982042 -l'd really like to talk to him.<br />-l don't think that's a good idea.
2982210 2984795 I think the best thing you could do<br />is leave him alone.
2984963 2988507 -Let's, uh, get something for your cold.<br />-l know what l'm talking about, Riggs.
2989509 2992802 -You and l have to talk.<br />-Talking to you is bad for my image.
2992970 2994804 -l'm afraid l insist.<br />-Oh, you insist?
2994972 2997223 Well, in that case,<br />let's find somewhere private.
2997391 2999517 Here, step into my orifice.
3002229 3003855 Here.
3005274 3006773 Hey, Becker, how's it hanging?
3006941 3008191 - Hey, Riggs.<br />- Yeah.
3008359 3011987 - Clip any wrong wires lately?<br />-No, I haven't done that for a couple days.
3012155 3014406 -Next time, wait for the bomb squad.<br />-Bomb squad.
3014574 3015657 Yeah, it's our job.
3015825 3018618 Okay, l'll remember that. We saved a cat.<br />What do you want?
3018786 3021495 -Great. l love cats.<br />-Hey.
3022622 3024248 Go ahead, talk. l'm listening.
3024416 3028210 You purposefully withheld information<br />concerning a case under my investigation.
3028378 3031755 -Yeah, damn right l did.<br />-Careful, she's Internal Affairs.
3031923 3034675 You had a tip on Travis,<br />you should have shared it with me.
3034843 3036469 No, I take that back.
3036636 3039220 You were required to share it with me.
3039388 3041764 -l was required to share it with you?<br />-Yeah.
3041932 3043892 I don't have to share shit with you.
3044059 3047312 If you don't scratch<br />my back, l don't throw you--
3047480 3050231 -Oh, come on, Riggs. l can't do that.<br />-Yes, you can.
3050399 3053317 Why don't you cut out<br />this classified bullshit?
3053485 3055652 Right now. It's giving me the shits!
3055820 3058572 We're cops. You're a cop, l'm a cop.<br />We're on the same side.
3058740 3059907 -Right? Right?<br />-Right!
3060074 3063160 Right? Good.<br />Why don't we start to act like it, huh?
3063328 3065245 Come on, there's kids out there. Babies.
3065413 3067414 No brains,<br />but they got automatic weapons.
3067582 3070708 -Yesterday, my partner, he nailed this kid--<br />-l know about Murtaugh.
3072628 3075588 -Yeah?<br />-Yeah. And l'm sorry, Riggs.
3076548 3078132 Yeah.
3081053 3082428 Look, uh....
3082888 3085388 Look, why don't you let me in on this?<br />I can help you.
3085556 3088767 I really wanna help you, if you'll let me.<br />Let me.
3088935 3091019 Come on, what do you say?<br />We got a deal?
3094941 3096274 Wash your hands, Riggs.
3098861 3101737 And, um, meet me in my office.
3102072 3105574 Yeah, yeah. Okay. l'll be right there.
3107410 3108452 Be right there.
3109329 3111080 MAC-10, 9 mm, semi-automatic...
3111248 3114375 -...converted to automatic--<br />-With 36 rounds in the magazine.
3114543 3118211 On a sesame-seed bun. Very illegal.
3118379 3121297 -That gun has a history. Wanna know it?<br />-Tell me.
3124802 3127428 Killed a convenience-store clerk<br />in L.A. County, July 1990.
3127596 3132015 Was used in a drive-by shooting<br />in San Bernardino County, August 1990.
3132183 3137145 Confiscated by a truant officer<br />of the L.A. School Board, October 1990.
3137313 3139940 Scheduled for destruction by the L.A.P.D.<br />six weeks ago.
3140108 3142568 -Scheduled for destruction?<br />-Yeah.
3142735 3144736 But it never got there.
3146780 3149740 Instead, it found its way into the hands<br />of a 15-year-old boy...
3149908 3152159 ...who fired on a police officer,<br />your partner.
3152327 3155663 -Thought it looked familiar.<br />-That gun and 15,000 others like it...
3155831 3159458 ...were stolen from a police storage<br />facility before they could be destroyed.
3159626 3162627 They should be paper clips right now<br />or license plates.
3162795 3166339 Anything but a gun. Here we are,<br />busting our asses on the streets...
3166507 3170719 ...to get these weapons out of circulation<br />and now they're headed right back out.
3170886 3173430 When you busted Phelps,<br />you stumbled onto something...
3173598 3175682 ...the department's<br />trying to keep a lid on.
3175850 3179226 That's why Internal Affairs is on this.<br />They think it's an inside job.
3179394 3181979 Yeah, that's right.<br />They knew police procedures.
3182147 3184398 They knew where the guns were<br />and how to get in.
3184566 3186859 They knew the sorting codes<br />on the containers...
3187027 3189820 ...because they took the automatics<br />and left the junk behind.
3189988 3192697 -lt all pointed to a cop.<br />-Or an ex-cop.
3192990 3195033 -Right. Travis.<br />-Travis.
3197703 3199787 And you let him slip<br />through your fingers.
3201040 3204500 -That's closer than you ever got.<br />-Close, Riggs?
3204668 3207712 Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window.
3210423 3213842 -You wanna go for a ride?<br />-Sure, where we going?
3214218 3215802 Surprise.
3220475 3222559 Oh, l love surprises.
3222810 3224185 What is this place?
3224353 3226854 I accessed Billy Phelps'<br />phone records on my computer.
3227022 3228814 He made a dozen calls to this address.
3228982 3231150 - Yeah?<br />- Nice of you to steal that information.
3231318 3232360 Semantics, Riggs.
3232527 3235571 Semantics? I'm always up for some antics.
3236281 3241076 -All right, let's go on three. One--<br />-Uh, on three, or three and then go?
3241243 3242952 -What?<br />-Never mind. One, two, three.
3246332 3247749 Gotcha.
3261596 3263681 Looks like Billy's grandmother<br />owns a big dog.
3263848 3265432 That isn't a dog. That's a horse.
3266101 3268060 I hate dogs, Riggs.
3268687 3270895 -l don't get it.<br />-You don't get what?
3271063 3273022 That's a dog. It's a fucking dog.
3273190 3278236 No, I don't get, "Close is a lingerie shop<br />without a front window." l don't get that.
3278404 3280279 Riggs, later.
3284576 3287285 -What are you doing?<br />-Well, l can't shoot a dog.
3287453 3289121 People, okay, but not dogs.
3289288 3291748 I think I should try<br />and make friends with him.
3291916 3294251 -Make friends?<br />-Yeah.
3294419 3298130 Now, don't run, because he'll only<br />chase you down and kill you.
3298297 3299881 Uh-huh.
3300591 3303509 Here, boy. Here, boy.
3310934 3313644 -Here. Good boy. Yes.<br />-Shit.
3320985 3322235 Riggs.
3327616 3328908 You're crazy.
3349011 3351971 Want one? Want one?<br />You hungry? Huh?
3353682 3355183 You're a hungry boy.
3355350 3357685 Doesn't anybody feed you? Come on.
3358103 3360104 What a good fella.
3360272 3362565 Here. Here's more. Leave some for me.
3362733 3366693 Very slowly, as if you're not here,<br />just walk away.
3366861 3369946 -You want me to go?<br />-Yeah. This is a guy sort of thing.
3370114 3372908 - Guy sort of thing?<br />- Are you all alone in here?
3382209 3383375 Stay, stay.
3385504 3387213 Come on, let's go.
3398182 3400058 -Let's go. Let's go.<br />- Watch.
3400226 3401559 On two.
3408400 3410276 -All right, how many is that?<br />- Fifty-five.
3410444 3413737 Fifty-five. All right, we got eight more.
3413905 3416114 All right, we'll get these later. Let's go.
3419744 3423080 Hi, fellas. What's in all these boxes?
3434007 3438177 Easy, let's not kill him yet.<br />Let's see who he is first, all right?
3440556 3442097 You have the right to remain silent.
3442265 3444015 Shut him up.
3444183 3446393 Sergeant Martin Riggs, heh.
3448437 3450522 -Hubie, get the truck ready.<br />-Right.
3450690 3452190 So, Sergeant Riggs...
3452358 3453942 ...how did you find us?
3454110 3455402 Freeze. Police!
3457071 3458279 Oh, another one?
3458697 3460281 We need a new fucking dog.
3460448 3462283 Get your hands up, asshole.
3462450 3464285 Get them up.
3467581 3469790 A little bit higher. That's better.
3471293 3472918 Very good.
3476881 3478715 Drop it, miss.
3480384 3481634 Now, look--
3529680 3532140 Okay, l'm on. No, l'm not. I'm off! Wait!
3532308 3534976 Wait. Wait, wait, wait!
3538438 3541815 -Sergeant Cole.<br />-Get down! Get down!
3545362 3546946 Get those cases and kill that dog.
3559166 3561542 Stop! The dog. Wait for the dog.
3561710 3564629 -Where'd you learn to fight?<br />-Catholic school. Forget the dog.
3564797 3568215 Here, boy. Come on. We're waiting<br />for the dog. Just hold it, hold it.
3568383 3571718 Hurry. Come on, dog.<br />Good dog. Good puppy. Go! Go!
3574222 3575389 Stop!
3575556 3577391 - What? What?<br />-Guns.
3577558 3578684 -Full of guns.<br />- Grab one.
3578851 3580560 -You grab one.<br />-You got friends?
3580728 3582187 Step on it!
3585899 3587900 Get that crate. Come on.
3593740 3596075 Hatchett, you said<br />not to worry about the police...
3596243 3598118 ...but the cops are all over you, man.
3598285 3600662 They got my guns.<br />They'll be coming after me next.
3600830 3602998 Far as l'm concerned, the deal's off.
3603165 3606334 Get a grip on yourself, Tyrone, all right?<br />We have a deal.
3606502 3607919 Nobody backs out.
3608087 3610088 You said you had the cops under control.
3610256 3613924 I see that isn't so. Give me one reason<br />why l should do business with you.
3614092 3618012 -l'll give you a real good reason.<br />-Hey, Tyrone, this is Travis.
3618179 3622307 You back out now, and I'll make certain<br />that only your dentist can identify the body.
3622475 3624768 Is that a good enough reason for you?
3627188 3628897 But l need ammo.
3629065 3630982 I'm out of business without ammo.
3631150 3635236 -l need the good stuff.<br />-You'll get the ammo. The good stuff.
3636447 3638156 "The good stuff." Jesus. Pfft!
3638323 3640450 Time to pay another visit to the L.A.P.D.
3642619 3644328 You look like l feel.
3654630 3657674 Hey. Hey.
3657842 3660052 You got anything l can put on my head?
3660219 3661594 There's a hat in the closet.
3661762 3666348 You're all heart. Here l thought you were<br />gonna get all tender and maternal with me.
3666516 3668934 Listen, Riggs,<br />I was raised with four brothers.
3669102 3670352 We got hurt all the time...
3670520 3673773 ...but if no bones were broken<br />or blood wasn't gushing, nobody cared.
3673940 3676316 -Hey, look, blood. See? Blood.<br />-lt's not gushing.
3676484 3679152 Well, it was free-flowing earlier.
3679528 3681488 Could you bring me<br />a needle and thread?
3681655 3685116 You know, maybe some peroxide.<br />I can patch it up myself.
3687161 3690080 -Don't touch anything.<br />-l wasn't. l didn't--
3691831 3693540 What's with you, anyway?
3708847 3711891 -The boys.<br />-Hey, what are you doing, huh?
3712059 3714685 -l told you not to touch anything.<br />-Uh, this came on by itself.
3714853 3717105 -Came on all by itself? You a wise guy?<br />-l swear.
3717272 3719190 You don't like to share your toys?
3719358 3721109 -This isn't a toy, Riggs.<br />-What is it?
3721276 3723026 -This is a weapon. Yeah.<br />-A weapon?
3723194 3725195 Used properly, a very effective weapon.
3725363 3727656 What, do you throw it at people?<br />Pretty heavy.
3727824 3730534 You're gonna give yourself a hernia.<br />Come here. Sit down.
3730701 3731701 Right here.
3731869 3734037 -Okay, take a little off the top.<br />-Right here.
3740210 3742545 -You bring all your interrogations home?<br />-Okay.
3742712 3745172 -What are we talking about?<br />-Well, it's back here.
3745340 3746715 Careful. Careful.
3746883 3748384 -Careful. Oh.<br />-This?
3748552 3751053 -This scratch?<br />-Come on, it feels like Grand Canyon.
3751221 3753013 -Oh, God.<br />-Ah!
3753181 3754639 -Hold still.<br />-Yeah.
3754807 3758768 -Ah!<br />-Oh, God. We haven't even started.
3758936 3760186 Be gentle with me.
3760938 3763565 I see this isn't virgin territory.<br />What is this? A knife?
3763732 3767610 Huh? Oh, that's an ax.<br />Some guy mistook my head for a log.
3767862 3770404 -That's a natural mistake.<br />-What, I have a wooden head?
3770572 3771864 -Look at that.<br />-lt's a knife.
3772031 3774158 -Knife? That's very knife.<br />-Mm-hm.
3774450 3775492 This is all right.
3775660 3778078 Oh, that's pavement,<br />dragged down Crenshaw. Mm-hm.
3778246 3781248 Hey, that's great. Look at that texture.<br />Look at this, huh?
3781416 3783417 Same damn thing. Third and Highland.
3783585 3786502 -Dragged for about half a block.<br />-That's a good one.
3786670 3788838 Feel that texture. Feel it.<br />Cheese-grater time.
3789006 3791090 -Moving truck.<br />-Moving truck? Ooh!
3791258 3792675 -Moving bullet.<br />-Moving bullet?
3792843 3794594 -Here. This is the best.<br />-Bullets now.
3795345 3798181 -lt goes all the way to the back.<br />-Oh, hey. Right through?
3798348 3799932 You're lucky. What is it, .22?
3800100 3801600 -lt's a .38, Riggs.<br />-That's a .38?
3801767 3804603 -lt's a .38.<br />-That's a wimpy .38. This is a .38.
3804770 3807689 -Yours is bigger than mine? Don't think so.<br />-l think so.
3807857 3809107 Maybe not, but look. Watch.
3809275 3812444 A whole family of .44s on the back.
3812612 3814696 -Look, there they are.<br />-lmpressive.
3814864 3818240 One got stuck in my lung.<br />I was breathing blood bubbles. Disgusting.
3818408 3819700 Blood bubbles. Okay.
3819868 3821744 -You got one?<br />-Mm.
3821912 3823537 Pump-action. 12-gauge.
3823830 3825289 -Oh, yeah.<br />-Mm-hm.
3825832 3828542 -Yeah. Right down here. Went through.<br />-Oh.
3828710 3829919 -That must've hurt.<br />-Right.
3830086 3831128 -Not too close.<br />-Pfft!
3831296 3833213 Riggs, if he were that close, l'd be dead.
3833380 3836132 I can beat it. I can beat it.<br />Have a look at this.
3836300 3838551 -l'll take your word for it.<br />-You gotta see this.
3838719 3841471 -l'll take your word.<br />-This guy had a knife. You'll love it.
3841639 3844265 He stuck it in my leg<br />and ran it around eight times.
3844683 3847310 -Hurt like a son of a bitch.<br />-l'll take your word for it.
3847477 3848602 No, I said forget it.
3848770 3851688 -This is a blue-ribbon event.<br />-Forget it, Riggs.
3852774 3853815 Hey, you started this.
3853983 3856652 -Yeah, well, I can end it.<br />-You know what?
3857111 3858487 You're a very poor loser.
3859948 3861156 I didn't lose, Riggs.
3861324 3863074 -Yes, you did.<br />-No. No, I didn't lose.
3863242 3864825 -You lost.<br />-l conceded.
3864993 3867411 There's a difference between<br />losing and conceding.
3867579 3869247 You conceded or you're conceited?
3869414 3871499 -You think l'm conceited?<br />-Oh, yeah.
3871667 3873834 Tell me you lost. Admit to it.
3874002 3875044 I'll get a Band-Aid.
3875212 3878339 -Tell me you lost.<br />-l said, don't touch anything.

4883779 4886656 Delores says that you're<br />the jam in her jelly roll. That's--
4886824 4888658 -l heard.<br />-Heh.
4888826 4890744 -That's a lot of woman there.<br />-Shit.
4890912 4894622 She calls me all the time. And she leaves<br />me notes. What am I gonna do?
4894789 4898292 -You shouldn't have led her on.<br />-Led her on? I didn't do anything, Riggs.
4898460 4902463 I mean, if Trish finds out about it--<br />I didn't-- I didn't--
4902797 4905466 Sergeant, we have got to talk.
4905634 4908259 You've gotta come see me.
4908427 4910678 Well, we gotta work. Come on. Let's go.
4910846 4913765 -Thanks anyway, for your concern.<br />-Yeah. Thanks, doc.
4914016 4915266 -You're a beauty.<br />- Coming?
4915434 4917310 A beauty. Yeah, l'm coming.
4924901 4926818 Afternoon, captain.
4928488 4931615 - That's good, Murphy.<br />- See how easy that was?
4935620 4937371 I love it down here, don't you, Murph?
4937538 4941791 This place is better than the swap meet.<br />Best bargains in town.
4945504 4947338 Give me the lock-up keys.
4947881 4950675 Those guys from the garage,<br />they're all ex-cons.
4950842 4952843 And all busted by<br />the same police officer...
4953011 4955095 ...Lieutenant Jack Edward Travis.
4955263 4957013 Early paroles<br />on the work furlough program.
4957181 4960684 Uh-huh. Employed by a company called<br />Mesa Verde Construction.
4960851 4963603 Just a minute. You can't go in there.<br />You don't have a pass.
4963771 4965021 -What?<br />-May I see your pass?
4965189 4966982 -Wanna see? Here's my pass.<br />-l do.
4967149 4969734 -l got shot in the line of duty, okay?<br />-He's with us.
4969902 4971443 -He's with us?<br />-Did l say that?
4971611 4974863 -Where'd you get her from?<br />-What are you doing out of the hospital?
4975031 4977533 Don't mention the hospital.<br />I told you not to leave me.
4977701 4980286 They tried to take my appendix.<br />They gave me a lapotomy.
4980453 4982413 -Brain surgery?<br />-No, a lapotomy.
4982580 4984873 Not a lobotomy.<br />Cut your hair so you can hear.
4985041 4986082 What's the difference?
4986250 4990336 The difference is, when you get a lapotomy,<br />they shave your nether regions.
4990504 4993673 -Nether what?<br />-Your nether-- I can't say it in front of her.
4993841 4995300 Well, point to it.
4996760 4998052 -Okay. Here.<br />-Must be itchy.
4998220 5000638 Yes, it is itchy.<br />These doctors are savages.
5000806 5003890 Where does it say that a gunshot wound<br />requires a rectal exam?
5004058 5005559 Huh? Huh?
5006936 5009396 Yeah. With a telescope<br />big enough to see Venus.
5009564 5011231 I guess all they saw was Uranus, huh?
5011399 5013567 Oh, that's great. Huh-huh.<br />That's great. Thank you.
5013735 5015152 -You know what l say?<br />-What?
5015320 5019071 They fuck you in the hospital!<br />First they drug you, then they fuck you.
5019239 5020448 And when they're done...
5020615 5023701 ...along comes the insurance company,<br />and fucks you some more.
5023869 5026912 Ten dollars for a fucking aspirin,<br />that's not even covered.
5027080 5028372 -Leo!<br />-That's enough.
5028540 5030082 -We're trying to work here.<br />-Okay.
5030250 5033084 What's new on our case?<br />Anything new? You got Travis yet?
5033252 5034836 You take an ad out in the paper?
5035004 5037589 -He's family. We gotta go somewhere else.<br />-Who's she?
5037757 5039883 -Sergeant Cole.<br />-Hey, how are you? Leo Getz.
5040051 5041760 Anything you need, Leo Getz. Get it?
5041927 5043887 -l get it.<br />-Real estate right now but....
5044055 5046389 Hey, listen. Come on, you guys,<br />give me a break.
5046557 5048724 I owe this guy one.<br />Give me something to do.
5048892 5050476 You can get us a cup of coffee.
5050643 5053937 That's great. I take one for you,<br />and that's what you tell me?
5054105 5057441 -He could check this out.<br />-That's all I'm good for? Takes slugs--
5057609 5060235 Leo, Leo, Leo. Look.<br />We got something for you to do.
5060403 5063905 Check out Mesa Verde Construction.<br />Find out all the information you can.
5064073 5066783 -Okay. Sure, l can do this.<br />-Remember that name?
5066950 5068785 Right around-- Mesa Verde, I got it.
5068952 5071287 What are you doing giving him<br />Mesa Verde?
5071455 5073289 If there's shit there, he'll dig it up.
5073457 5075333 -Who is that guy?<br />- lt's a long story.
5081631 5083048 Here are your keys, captain.
5084467 5086176 -You motherfucker.<br />-Don't be stupid.
5086344 5088929 - The fuck?<br />-Take the elevator, bring the other guys.
5089097 5090889 Keys. Give me your fucking hands.
5091891 5095434 Goddamn you, Travis. Fuck.
5096103 5098187 Stand there.
5101608 5104110 I can get faster results<br />than that real-estate broker.
5104277 5107029 Leo's not just a real-estate broker.
5107197 5110074 Yeah, he's a royal pain in the ass<br />with a lot of connections.
5111117 5114702 This is what we came for.<br />Load everything on the elevator, guys.
5114870 5117205 -How'd you know where to find them?<br />-We got it all.
5117373 5119499 World of computers, Murph.<br />World of computers.
5119667 5122335 You used to be one of us,<br />for chrissakes, Jack.
5122503 5125588 You know what future<br />a cop has, Murph? None.
5125756 5128841 Punch a clock for 30 years. Retirement.
5129092 5130384 Pension.
5130885 5131927 Nothing to do.
5132095 5135514 Drunk at noon, bullet in the brain<br />by evening. Well, not for this kid.
5135682 5137808 Police department's got it all:
5137976 5141145 Guns, ammo, drugs, cash.<br />It's a one-stop shopping center.
5141312 5144689 If you got the brains, there's not<br />a thing anybody can do about it.
5144857 5147525 You're already fucking history<br />and you know it.
5147693 5150027 Sorry, Murph.<br />But l'm just getting started.
5150529 5152530 - Something's wrong here.<br />- What?
5152698 5155158 The program's been accessed<br />by somebody from the outside.
5155325 5156826 What? What's been accessed?
5156994 5160579 After the guns were stolen, lnternal Affairs<br />moved the confiscated ammunition.
5160746 5162956 -Armor-piercing bullets?<br />-Thousands of rounds...
5163124 5165709 ...to a more secured location. Shit.
5165877 5167752 -That's been accessed.<br />-Somebody knows.
5167920 5170130 Where's it stored?<br />Where did they move it?
5171466 5172965 - Wait, wait.<br />- Let's go.
5173133 5176594 -l guess I'm not cut out for Internal Affairs.<br />-Where is it?
5176761 5178053 - In the building.<br />- Where?
5178221 5179972 - I'm showing you.<br />- Something going down?
5180140 5182099 -Nothing's going down.<br />-l'm going with you.
5182267 5184059 -Uh, how old are you?<br />-Twenty-two today.
5184227 5187563 Twenty-two? Come on.<br />You got protection?
5187731 5190482 -Right here in my wallet.<br />-No, your vest, you dummy.
5190649 5191733 Should we take him?
5191901 5194444 Okay, but keep your head down.<br />Keep your head down.
5194612 5196029 -Stay behind me.<br />-Come on, let's go.
5196197 5197405 - Yahoo!<br />-Shh! Quiet.
5209751 5211376 See, you were my ticket in, Murph.
5211961 5214588 It's too bad<br />you won't be coming with me.
5218718 5219967 Travis.
5220135 5221969 - They got it all.<br />- Shit.
5222679 5224639 -He's dead.<br />-How'd they get it out of here?
5224806 5227266 -l don't know.<br />-They didn't take it upstairs.
5227434 5229393 Hey, hey. Elevator.
5231980 5234607 -Shit. lt's down.<br />-Hey, the subway's down there.

5804390 5807517 I can't believe you did that.<br />I got a spare in the trunk.
5810480 5812146 -You're driving.<br />-No, I'm driving.
5812314 5815024 How could you do that?<br />I can't believe you did that.
5815192 5817651 -l can't believe you did that.<br />- Hey, where's Lorna?
5817819 5819987 -l can't believe you did that.<br />- With Walters.

5829163 5831831 -l can't believe they did that.<br />-Twenty-one and 18, clear.
5831999 5833333 Excuse me, do you own your home?
5867199 5869867 -Looks like we came to the right place.<br />-Yeah.
5870035 5871869 Move on out to Travis Town.
5872037 5874288 Great place to raise a family.
5874789 5876957 Built on guns and bloodshed.
5877125 5879835 One hell of a retirement plan<br />this asshole's got, isn't it?
5880002 5882379 Let's foreclose on this son of a bitch.
5882964 5885423 -Say, is that, uh--?<br />-lt's Darryl's gun.
5885591 5888260 -Saving it for the right occasion.<br />-This is the right occasion.
5888427 5890344 How many men you think he has?
5890512 5892888 Who knows? Maybe l should<br />run over there and ask him?
5893056 5894598 -That'd be too easy.<br />-Yeah.
5894808 5896892 Wish I had some grenades<br />or a rocket launcher.
5897060 5898853 Maybe a ground-to-air missile.
5899020 5901939 Hey, I wonder what Murphy's got<br />in his trunk.
5904234 5906693 Well, it's obvious Murph was<br />never a Boy Scout.
5907153 5908736 -Not even a good spare.<br />-Yeah.
5910406 5911739 Shit.
5912825 5914576 Put your hands down. lt's embarrassing.

6737971 6740139 Well, l knew you couldn't stop smoking.
6740307 6742934 I'm smoking to take my mind off<br />my dog-biscuit problem.
6743101 6746145 -What dog-biscuit problem?<br />-l've been chasing more cars lately...
6746313 6749356 ...and, uh, when I try and lick my balls,<br />I keep falling off the couch.

6765497 6767039 -You know something, Riggs?<br />-What?
6767207 6770960 When I do retire,<br />I hope your next partner is just like you.
6771503 6775047 There's winners and there's losers,<br />and God wouldn't do that to me.

6791605 6793898 - You can't be serious.<br />- What are you talking about?
6794066 6795899 I saw what it was. You kissed Rianne.
6796067 6797901 She kissed me. She finds me irresistible.
6798069 6801029 - That's not the point.<br />- lt was a platonic peck on the cheek.
6801197 6803824 If it's just friendship,<br />try shaking hands next time.
6803992 6807035 - Getting enough fiber in your diet?<br />- I'm getting enough fiber.

7052641 7054058 They'll never believe this.
7054226 7056810 - l hope nobody saw us.<br />- They'll blame me.
7056978 7060230 Let's keep cool. You better get<br />your girdle out of mothballs.
7060397 7062232 They'll say, "Back in uniform again."
7062399 7065026 - Find one that fits.<br />- Ten more years of this.
7065194 7066152 I'm too old for this shit.
7066153 7068154 I'm too old for this shit.
