50343 53763 <i>- Is everything in place?</i><br /><i>- You're not to relieve me.</i>
54013 56641 <i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>
57183 59561 <i>You like him, don't you?<br />You like watching him.</i>
59811 62814 <i>- Don't be ridiculous.</i><br /><i>- We're going to kill him.</i>
63064 65525 <i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>
65692 66735 <i>Do you?</i>
66901 68737 <i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>
68987 70613 <i>You don't, do you?</i>
70864 72949 <i>- Did you hear that?</i><br /><i>- Hear what?</i>
73158 74784 <i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>
75034 77036 <i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>
77370 78830 <i>I better go.</i>
116785 118705 - Freeze! Police!<br />- Hands on your head!
119120 120205 Do it! Do it now!
141601 144229 - Lieutenant.<br />- Oh, shit.
145063 148274 Lieutenant, you were given<br />specific orders.
148525 150235 I'm just doing my job.
150860 155281 You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"<br />crap, you can cram it up your ass.
155740 158243 The orders were for your protection.
159744 161955 I think we can handle one little girl.
167085 168837 I sent two units!
169087 170672 They're bringing her down now!
170922 174050 No, lieutenant, your men<br />are already dead.
203121 204205 Shit.
207125 209210 Morpheus, the line was traced.<br />I don't know how.
209460 211087 <i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>
211296 213464 <i>There's no time.<br />Get to another exit.</i>
213715 216134 - Are there any agents?<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
216342 217510 Goddamn it.
217760 219304 <i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>
219554 221931 <i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>
222307 223975 <i>You can make it.</i>
224225 225894 - All right.<br /><i>- Go.</i>
288039 289082 That's impossible.
324075 326077 Get up, Trinity. Just get up.
326744 327954 Get up.
373833 375334 She got out.
375626 376919 It doesn't matter.
377170 380339 - The informant is real.<br />- Yes.
380506 382266 We have the name of their next target.
382508 384177 The name is Neo.
387472 388973 We'll need a search running.
389265 391184 It has already begun.
445947 447156 What?
452912 454413 What the hell?
462046 464006 "Follow the white rabbit."
475852 477019 Who is it?
477270 478563 It's Choi.
483693 485528 Yeah. Yeah.
492076 493244 You're two hours late.
493828 495580 I know. It's her fault.
495746 496831 You got the money?
498958 500126 Two grand.
501002 502128 Hold on.
519812 521189 Hallelujah.
521439 524317 You're my savior.<br />My own personal Jesus Christ.
524567 526444 You get caught using that...
526694 528821 I know. This never happened.<br />You don't exist.
529947 532033 - Right.<br />- Something wrong, man?
532283 534327 You look a little whiter than usual.
535453 537622 My computer, it...
540625 545171 Ever have that feeling where you're<br />not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
545963 548716 All the time.<br />It's called mescaline.
549217 551344 It's the only way to fly.
552220 554722 It just sounds like you<br />need to unplug.
555473 557475 Get some R and R?
557892 561646 What do you think, Dujour?<br />Should we take him with us?
563648 564857 Definitely.
565107 568194 No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.
568819 569946 Come on.
570196 572823 It'll be fun. I promise.
579330 580831 Yeah.
581666 583501 Sure. I'll go.
611112 612196 Hello, Neo.
613531 614699 How do you know that name?
615533 617243 I know a lot about you.
618119 620204 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
621163 622373 Trinity.
624000 625167 The Trinity?
625626 627336 That cracked the IRS D-base?
627586 629046 That was a long time ago.
629297 631215 - Jesus.<br />- What?
631674 633467 I just thought...
635219 636387 ...you were a guy.
636637 638097 Most guys do.
639307 641517 That was you on my computer.
642143 643227 How did you do that?
643894 646605 Right now, all I can tell you...
647231 648774 ...is that you're in danger.
649233 651652 - I brought you here to warn you.<br />- Of what?
652236 653904 They're watching you, Neo.
654488 656907 - Who is?<br />- Please just listen.
660411 662246 I know why you're here, Neo.
663039 664999 I know what you've been doing.
665249 667126 I know why you hardly sleep...
667418 670546 ...why you live alone and why,<br />night after night...
670796 673132 ...you sit at your computer.
674300 675843 You're looking for him.
676635 679638 I know, because I was once<br />looking for the same thing.
680139 682266 And when he found me...
682892 685978 ...he told me I wasn't really<br />looking for him...
686896 688647 ...I was looking for an answer.
689273 692401 It's the question that drives us, Neo.
693069 695738 It's the question<br />that brought you here.
697823 699200 You know the question...
699450 700951 ...just as I did.
702495 704121 What is the Matrix?
704372 706832 The answer is out there, Neo.
707500 709502 It's looking for you.
710294 711962 And it will find you...
712254 714256 ...if you want it to.
720971 722014 Shit.
722181 723391 Shit, shit.
733651 736487 You have a problem with authority,<br />Mr. Anderson.
736737 740783 You believe that you are special,<br />that the rules do not apply to you.
741492 743494 Obviously, you are mistaken.
746455 749333 This is one of the top<br />software companies in the world...
749583 752962 ...because employees understand<br />they are part of a whole.
753212 757842 Thus, if an employee has a problem,<br />the company has a problem.
760094 763305 The time has come to make<br />a choice, Mr. Anderson.
764181 768060 Either you choose to be at your desk<br />on time from this day forth...
768686 771272 ...or you choose to find another job.
772148 773482 Do I make myself clear?
773732 776152 Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.<br />Perfectly clear.
784285 785494 Thomas Anderson?
787746 789165 Yeah, that's me.
789957 791167 Okay.
797173 798340 Great.
799758 800926 Have a nice day.
816400 817443 Hello?
817735 821071 <i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>
823324 825075 - Morpheus.<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
825326 827328 <i>I've been looking for you.</i>
827578 830748 <i>I don't know if you're ready to see<br />what I want to show you.</i>
830998 834168 <i>But unfortunately, you and I<br />have run out of time.</i>
834418 838130 <i>They're coming for you, and I don't know<br />what they're going to do.</i>
838380 839715 Who's coming for me?
839965 842051 <i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>
842301 843802 What? Right now?
844094 846597 <i>Yes. Now.</i>
847473 849350 <i>Do it slowly.</i>
849767 850976 <i>The elevator.</i>
855856 857650 - Oh, shit!<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
862321 863405 What do they want?
863572 866909 <i>I don't know. If you don't want<br />to find out, get out of there.</i>
867076 868118 How?
868327 871497 <i>I can guide you,<br />but you must do exactly as I say.</i>
871705 874375 - Okay.<br /><i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>
877503 879630 - But what if they...<br /><i>- Go. Now.</i>
886387 888764 <i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>
895980 898732 <i>When I tell you,<br />go to the end of the row...</i>
898983 900943 <i>...to the office<br />at the end of the hall.</i>
901193 903571 <i>Stay as low as you can.</i>
905864 906991 <i>Go. Now.</i>
921380 924925 <i>Good. Now, outside<br />there is a scaffold.</i>
927636 929972 - How do you know this?<br /><i>- We don't have time.</i>
930222 933058 <i>To your left there's a window.<br />Go to it.</i>
935311 936854 <i>Open it.</i>
937688 939481 <i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>
939732 942318 No way! No way! This is crazy!
942568 944945 <i>There are two ways<br />out of this building.</i>
945195 948991 <i>One is that scaffold.<br />The other is in their custody.</i>
949241 952453 <i>You take a chance either way.<br />I leave it to you.</i>
956040 957791 This is insane!
958959 960836 Why is this happening to me?
961128 962755 What'd I do?
963130 965883 I'm nobody.<br />I didn't do anything.
966467 967926 I'm gonna die.
977728 978771 Shit!
999041 1000167 Oh, shit!
1005130 1006924 I can't do this.
1019561 1020604 Shit.
1069862 1074700 As you can see, we've had our eye on<br />you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
1075993 1078662 It seems that you've been living...
1078912 1081039 ...two lives.
1082458 1084960 In one life,<br />you're Thomas A. Anderson...
1085210 1088547 ...program writer for<br />a respectable software company.
1089590 1092885 You have a social security number.<br />You pay your taxes.
1093343 1094595 And you...
1096180 1099808 ...help your landlady<br />carry out her garbage.
1102311 1105439 The other life is lived in computers...
1105731 1108692 ...where you go by<br />the hacker alias "Neo"...
1108942 1113739 ...and are guilty of virtually every<br />computer crime we have a law for.
1115032 1116992 One of these lives...
1117242 1119077 ...has a future.
1119411 1121413 And one of them does not.
1125125 1128962 I'm going to be as forthcoming<br />as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
1129963 1131298 You're here...
1131632 1133884 ...because we need your help.
1137513 1140516 We know that you've been contacted<br />by a certain...
1140766 1142559 ...individual.
1143477 1147523 A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
1148524 1152528 Whatever you think you know<br />about this man is irrelevant.
1152778 1155197 He is considered by many authorities...
1155447 1158492 ...to be the most dangerous man alive.
1161203 1162412 My colleagues...
1162871 1165791 ...believe that I am wasting<br />my time with you.
1166083 1169503 But I believe you wish<br />to do the right thing.
1169795 1173298 We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
1173674 1175801 ...give you a fresh start.
1176301 1179221 All we're asking in return<br />is your cooperation...
1179471 1182975 ...in bringing<br />a known terrorist to justice.
1184351 1185602 Yeah.
1186895 1188981 That sounds like a really good deal.
1190607 1192359 But I got a better one.
1192609 1194111 How about...
1194528 1196530 ...I give you the finger...
1199116 1201118 ...and you give me my phone call.
1203328 1205163 Mr. Anderson...
1209334 1210377 ...you disappoint me.
1210627 1213255 You can't scare me<br />with this gestapo crap.
1213505 1214882 I know my rights.
1215132 1216633 I want my phone call.
1217217 1219386 Tell me, Mr. Anderson...
1220262 1221680 ...what good is a phone call...
1221930 1225517 ...if you're unable to speak?
1259301 1261511 You're going to help us,<br />Mr. Anderson...
1262012 1264181 ...whether you want to or not.
1322614 1325867 <i>This line is tapped,<br />so I must be brief.</i>
1326118 1330414 <i>They got to you first, but they've<br />underestimated how important you are.</i>
1330664 1332499 <i>If they knew what I know...</i>
1332749 1334751 <i>...you would probably be dead.</i>
1335752 1339464 What are you talking about?<br />What is happening to me?
1339715 1344553 <i>You are the One, Neo. You may have<br />spent the last few years...</i>
1344803 1347764 <i>...looking for me, but I've spent<br />my entire life...</i>
1348015 1349516 <i>...looking for you.</i>
1351059 1353228 <i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>
1354187 1357065 - Yes.<br /><i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>
1367284 1368493 Get in.
1380547 1381590 What's this?
1381840 1384384 It's necessary, Neo.<br />For our protection.
1384634 1386803 - From what?<br />- From you.
1388346 1389806 - Take off your shirt.<br />- What?
1389973 1391141 Stop the car.
1395729 1396897 Listen, coppertop.
1397147 1399149 We don't have time for 20 Questions.
1399649 1402027 Right now, there's only one rule:
1402319 1403653 Our way...
1403987 1405072 ...or the highway.
1411620 1412704 Fine.
1414581 1417042 Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
1417626 1420253 - Why?<br />- Because you have been down there.
1421004 1422214 You know that road.
1423215 1424841 You know exactly where it ends.
1427052 1429304 And I know that's<br />not where you want to be.
1443485 1445028 Apoc, lights.
1447531 1449699 Lie back.<br />Lift up your shirt.
1451618 1453870 - What's that?<br />- You're bugged.
1461628 1463088 Try and relax.
1469386 1470554 Come on.
1471596 1472639 Come on.
1474391 1475392 It's on the move.
1477185 1478395 Come on, you shit.
1480230 1482482 - You're gonna lose it.<br />- No, I'm not.
1482649 1483733 Clear!
1492325 1494452 Jesus Christ!<br />That thing's real!?
1528195 1529529 This is it.
1532866 1535327 Let me give you one piece of advice.
1536286 1537954 Be honest.
1539539 1541750 He knows more than you can imagine.
1550467 1551801 At last.
1553345 1554429 Welcome, Neo.
1555639 1557557 As you no doubt have guessed...
1557807 1559059 ...I am Morpheus.
1560101 1561686 It's an honor to meet you.
1562145 1563188 No...
1563772 1565065 ...the honor is mine.
1565982 1568485 Please, come. Sit.
1583583 1585210 I imagine...
1585627 1588380 ...that right now you're feeling<br />a bit like Alice...
1590090 1592509 ...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
1593343 1594427 You could say that.
1595345 1597973 I can see it in your eyes.
1598556 1601851 You have the look of a man<br />who accepts what he sees...
1602102 1604354 ...because he's expecting to wake up.
1605772 1608358 Ironically, this is not<br />far from the truth.
1609067 1611444 Do you believe in fate, Neo?
1611611 1612696 No.
1613113 1614155 Why not?
1614406 1617200 I don't like the idea that<br />I'm not in control of my life.
1618285 1621621 I know exactly what you mean.
1625917 1628295 Let me tell you why you're here.
1629337 1630880 You know something.
1631423 1633049 What you know,<br />you can't explain.
1633550 1635135 But you feel it.
1635719 1637637 You felt it your entire life:
1638221 1642392 Something's wrong with the world.<br />You don't know what, but it's there.
1642892 1645103 Like a splinter in your mind...
1645353 1647230 ...driving you mad.
1648148 1650900 It is this feeling<br />that has brought you to me.
1653445 1655280 Do you know what<br />I'm talking about?
1657115 1658450 The Matrix?
1660952 1662620 Do you want to know...
1663079 1665081 ...what it is?
1667459 1669336 The Matrix is everywhere.
1669586 1671296 It is all around us.
1671546 1673506 Even now, in this very room.
1674341 1676551 You can see it when you<br />look out your window...
1676801 1679137 ...or when you turn on your television.
1679554 1682098 You can feel it when you go to work...
1683641 1685310 ...when you go to church...
1685727 1687812 ...when you pay your taxes.
1688938 1691858 It is the world that has been<br />pulled over your eyes...
1692108 1693693 ...to blind you from the truth.
1695904 1697155 What truth?
1701409 1702952 That you are a slave.
1704454 1706748 Like everyone else,<br />you were born into bondage...
1706998 1711669 ...born into a prison that you cannot<br />smell or taste or touch.
1711961 1713254 A prison...
1713505 1714631 ...for your mind.
1721638 1723973 Unfortunately, no one can be...
1724307 1726684 ...told what the Matrix is.
1730146 1732023 You have to see it for yourself.
1741533 1743827 This is your last chance.
1744077 1746413 After this, there is no turning back.
1746871 1748331 You take the blue pill...
1748665 1751709 ...the story ends, you wake up<br />in your bed and believe...
1751960 1753753 ...whatever you want to believe.
1754003 1755338 You take the red pill...
1755588 1757549 ...you stay in Wonderland...
1758049 1760760 ...and I show you how deep<br />the rabbit hole goes.
1770645 1771855 Remember...
1772689 1775733 ...all I'm offering is the truth.<br />Nothing more.
1790039 1791374 Follow me.
1793918 1795587 Apoc, are we on-line?
1795837 1797213 Almost.
1800550 1802594 Time is always against us.
1802969 1804471 Please take a seat there.
1822655 1824365 - You did all this?<br />- Mm-hm.
1828495 1830497 The pill you took is<br />part of a trace program.
1831247 1835877 It disrupts your carrier signals<br />so we can pinpoint your location.
1836419 1837462 What does that mean?
1838046 1840215 It means buckle your<br />seat belt, Dorothy...
1840548 1841883 ...because Kansas...
1842133 1843176 ...is going bye-bye.
1881089 1882465 Did you...?
1893476 1897564 Have you ever had a dream, Neo,<br />that you were so sure was real?
1899023 1901609 What if you were unable<br />to wake from that dream?
1901859 1904362 How would you know the difference<br />between the dream world...
1904988 1906406 ...and the real world?
1908032 1909200 This can't be.
1909367 1910410 Be what?
1911119 1912620 Be real?
1916583 1918001 - Going into replication.<br />- Apoc?
1918209 1919210 Still nothing.
1919794 1921004 It's cold.
1921254 1922630 It's cold!
1926509 1928177 Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
1929679 1932348 - I got a fibrillation.<br />- Apoc, location.
1932599 1934058 Targeting almost there.
1937353 1938771 He's going into arrest.
1939022 1941524 - Lock. I got him!<br />- Now, Tank, now!
2118785 2119869 Welcome...
2120203 2122121 ...to the real world.
2123539 2125374 We've done it, Trinity.
2125625 2127168 We found him.
2127418 2130213 - I hope you're right.<br />- I don't have to hope.
2130797 2132381 I know it.
2137553 2138596 Am I dead?
2139096 2141265 Far from it.
2155238 2156656 He still needs a lot of work.
2158199 2159283 What are you doing?
2159534 2161744 Your muscles atrophied.<br />We're rebuilding them.
2162328 2163871 Why do my eyes hurt?
2164580 2166457 You've never used them before.
2170211 2171254 Rest, Neo.
2171504 2173172 The answers are coming.
2247747 2249332 Morpheus, what's happened to me?
2249957 2251042 What is this place?
2251292 2253961 More important than "what" is "when."
2254462 2255504 "When"?
2255713 2257757 You believe it's the year 1999...
2258007 2260259 ...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.
2261385 2264138 I can't tell you exactly<br />what year it is...
2264388 2266015 ...because we honestly don't know.
2266515 2269352 There's nothing I can say<br />that will explain it for you.
2269602 2272355 Come with me. See for yourself.
2272897 2274649 This is my ship.
2274941 2277860 The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i><br />It's a hovercraft.
2280696 2282448 This is the main deck.
2288204 2289455 This is the core...
2291958 2295711 ...where we broadcast our pirate signal<br />and hack into the Matrix.
2299090 2302259 Most of my crew you already know.
2307264 2308683 This is Apoc...
2309475 2310810 ...Switch...
2312395 2313562 - ...and Cypher.<br />- Hi.
2313813 2317525 The ones you don't know:<br />Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
2318401 2320820 The little one behind you is Mouse.
2325157 2328411 You wanted to know<br />what the Matrix is?
2329453 2330663 Trinity.
2351684 2353269 Try to relax.
2358149 2359984 This will feel a little weird.
2371954 2373330 This...
2373497 2375207 ...is the Construct.
2375624 2377752 It's our loading program.
2378002 2380463 We can load anything, from clothing...
2380713 2382089 ...to equipment...
2382381 2383716 ...weapons...
2384341 2386177 ...training simulations...
2386552 2389096 ...anything we need.
2391891 2394310 Right now we're inside<br />a computer program?
2394602 2396520 Is it really so hard to believe?
2397021 2399648 Your clothes are different.<br />The plugs in your body are gone.
2400858 2402943 Your hair has changed.
2403319 2406655 Your appearance now is what we call<br />"residual self-image."
2407364 2409992 It is the mental projection<br />of your digital self.
2415873 2416999 This isn't real?
2417249 2418793 What is "real"?
2419168 2421420 How do you define "real"?
2421712 2423631 If you're talking about<br />what you can feel...
2423881 2426300 ...what you can smell, taste and see...
2426550 2430429 ...then "real" is simply electrical<br />signals interpreted by your brain.
2434600 2437019 This is the world that you know.
2438437 2441482 The world as it was at the end<br />of the 20th century.
2443859 2448197 It exists now only as part of<br />a neural-interactive simulation...
2448447 2449698 ...that we call the Matrix.
2454245 2457039 You've been living<br />in a dream world, Neo.
2458040 2459166 This is the world...
2459458 2461210 ...as it exists today.
2474265 2477226 Welcome to "the desert...
2478102 2479687 ...of the real."
2483065 2485442 We have only bits and pieces<br />of information.
2485693 2489488 But what we know for certain<br />is that in the early 21st century...
2489738 2492992 ...all of mankind was united<br />in celebration.
2493242 2497997 We marveled at our own magnificence<br />as we gave birth to AI.
2498789 2499915 AI.
2500958 2502334 You mean artificial intelligence.
2502585 2507006 A singular consciousness that spawned<br />an entire race of machines.
2507840 2511302 We don't know who struck first,<br />us or them.
2511719 2514930 But we know that it was us<br />that scorched the sky.
2516599 2518767 They were dependent on solar power...
2519018 2522354 ...and it was believed that<br />they would be unable to survive...
2522688 2526192 ...without an energy source<br />as abundant as the sun.
2526442 2531322 Throughout human history, we have<br />been dependent on machines to survive.
2532781 2536994 Fate, it seems, is not<br />without a sense of irony.
2540206 2544627 The human body generates more<br />bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
2544877 2549006 And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
2550925 2553093 Combined with a form of fusion...
2553427 2558265 ...the machines had found all the energy<br />they would ever need.
2562311 2566065 There are fields, Neo,<br />endless fields...
2566315 2569568 ...where human beings<br />are no longer born.
2570277 2572112 We are grown.
2578160 2580746 For the longest time,<br />I wouldn't believe it.
2580996 2583666 And then I saw the fields<br />with my own eyes...
2585000 2586627 ...watched them liquefy the dead...
2586877 2590214 ...so they could be fed intravenously<br />to the living.
2590756 2595010 And standing there,<br />facing the pure, horrifying precision...
2595261 2598180 ...I came to realize<br />the obviousness of the truth.
2600808 2602601 What is the Matrix?
2603811 2604853 Control.
2606230 2609608 The Matrix is a computer-generated<br />dream world...
2610401 2613487 ...built to keep us under control...
2614655 2617825 ...in order to change a human being...
2618450 2619618 ...into this.
2620995 2622121 No.
2623747 2625332 I don't believe it.
2625708 2626917 It's not possible.
2627501 2632089 I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.<br />I just said it would be the truth.
2632339 2633632 Stop!
2634174 2635384 Let me out!
2636093 2638012 Let me out! I want out!
2639972 2642641 - Easy, Neo. Easy.<br />- Get this thing out of me.
2642891 2644560 Get this thing out of me!
2646353 2647855 Don't touch me!
2648105 2649732 Stay away from me!
2650149 2651650 I don't believe it.
2652359 2653569 I don't believe it.
2653819 2655321 I don't believe it.
2655571 2657614 - He's gonna pop.<br />- Breathe, Neo.
2657990 2659074 Just breathe.
2677468 2679261 I can't go back, can I?
2680095 2681513 No.
2682348 2683557 But if you could...
2684391 2685893 ...would you really want to?
2688395 2689772 I owe you an apology.
2690356 2691732 We have a rule.
2692191 2695444 We never free a mind<br />once it's reached a certain age.
2695611 2696695 It's dangerous.
2697404 2699114 The mind has trouble letting go.
2699365 2701658 I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
2702701 2704787 I did what I did because...
2705496 2706955 ...I had to.
2715381 2719468 When the Matrix was first built,<br />there was a man born inside...
2719968 2723764 ...who had the ability<br />to change whatever he wanted...
2724139 2727059 ...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
2728811 2732272 It was he who freed the first of us...
2733148 2734775 ...taught us the truth.
2736235 2739321 As long as the Matrix exists...
2739655 2741740 ...the human race will never be free.
2745953 2747496 After he died...
2748247 2750958 ...the Oracle prophesied his return...
2751500 2754711 ...and that his coming would hail<br />the destruction of the Matrix...
2754962 2756630 ...end the war...
2756964 2758215 ...bring freedom to our people.
2759550 2764179 That is why there are those of us who<br />spent our lives searching the Matrix...
2764513 2766098 ...looking for him.
2768517 2770602 I did what I did because...
2772229 2774356 ...I believe that search is over.
2779445 2780863 Get some rest.
2781488 2783282 You're going to need it.
2785993 2787035 For what?
2790080 2791290 Your training.
2809600 2811310 Morning. Did you sleep?
2812186 2813395 You will tonight.
2813770 2815314 I guarantee it.
2816815 2818734 I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
2819193 2821612 - You don't have any...<br />- Holes? Nope.
2822529 2827242 Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%<br />pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
2827493 2828702 Born free right here...
2829244 2830579 ...in the real world.
2830829 2832498 Genuine child of Zion.
2833332 2835792 - Zion?<br />- If the war was over tomorrow...
2836043 2837544 ...Zion's where the party would be.
2837961 2839254 It's a city?
2839505 2842674 The last human city.<br />The only place we have left.
2844259 2845511 Where is it?
2847262 2850682 Deep underground near the Earth's core,<br />where it's still warm.
2852309 2854186 You live long enough,<br />you might see it.
2856438 2861276 Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited<br />to see what you're capable of...
2861527 2863278 ...if Morpheus is right and all.
2863779 2866532 We're not supposed to<br />talk about this, but...
2866782 2868200 ...if you are...
2869284 2871286 ...it's a very exciting time.
2872329 2875040 We got a lot to do.<br />We gotta get to it.
2878961 2881880 We're supposed to start<br />with these programs first.
2882881 2886343 That's major boring shit.<br />Let's do something more fun.
2886677 2888136 How about...
2889721 2891473 ...combat training?
2897521 2898981 "Jujitsu"?
2899856 2901525 I'm going to learn jujitsu?
2912869 2914079 Holy shit!
2914329 2916665 "Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
2916999 2918292 How about some more?
2918542 2919835 Hell, yes.
2921920 2922963 Hell, yeah.
2935142 2936226 How is he?
2936476 2938645 Ten hours straight.<br />He's a machine.
2949865 2951241 I know kung fu.
2952909 2953910 Show me.
2955704 2957456 This is a sparring program...
2957706 2960500 ...similar to the programmed reality<br />of the Matrix.
2960751 2963086 It has the same basic rules.<br />Like gravity.
2963337 2966798 These rules are no different<br />than those of a computer system.
2967341 2968842 Some of them can be bent.
2969051 2971511 Others can be broken.
2972054 2973138 Understand?
2974222 2975265 Then hit me...
2975849 2976975 ...if you can.
3015972 3017015 Good!
3017766 3018934 Adaptation.
3019226 3020435 Improvisation.
3020727 3022062 But your weakness...
3022312 3023689 ...is not your technique.
3030654 3032739 Morpheus is fighting Neo.
3105020 3106188 How did I beat you?
3112778 3113862 You're too fast.
3114404 3115739 Do you believe that...
3116114 3118617 ...my being stronger or faster...
3118867 3122537 ...has anything to do<br />with my muscles in this place?
3126583 3128376 You think you're breathing air?
3141890 3143099 Again!
3154569 3156988 Jesus Christ, he's fast!
3157239 3159449 His neuro-kinetics<br />are way above normal.
3164913 3166373 What are you waiting for?
3166623 3168583 You're faster than this.
3170794 3173004 Don't think you are.
3173255 3174923 Know you are.
3185308 3188103 Come on! Stop trying to hit me,<br />and hit me!
3198029 3199781 I don't believe it.
3201324 3203451 I know what you're trying to do.
3205120 3207289 I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
3207622 3209708 But I can only show you the door.
3210292 3212127 You have to walk through it.
3214504 3216631 Tank, load the jump program.
3228226 3230937 You have to let it all go, Neo.<br />Fear...
3231479 3233648 ...doubt and disbelief.
3234816 3237527 Free your mind.
3245785 3246912 Whoa.
3253710 3255420 Okey-dokey.
3257505 3258673 Free my mind.
3259132 3260258 What if he makes it?
3260508 3263219 - No one's ever made their first jump.<br />- I know.
3264554 3267015 - But what if he does?<br />- He won't.
3267599 3268683 Come on.
3268934 3270101 All right.
3270560 3272604 No problem. Free my mind.
3273396 3276191 Free my mind. No problem. Right.
3295585 3297253 What does that mean?
3297629 3299464 It doesn't mean anything.
3300048 3302634 Everybody falls the first time.
3303093 3304386 Right, Trin?
3325073 3327701 - I thought it wasn't real.<br />- Your mind makes it real.
3330954 3333206 If you're killed in the Matrix...
3333373 3334416 ...you die here?
3335041 3337502 The body cannot live without the mind.
3367991 3371369 I don't remember you ever<br />bringing me dinner.
3374456 3377292 There is something about him,<br />isn't there?
3377917 3379544 You're a believer now?
3380545 3381755 I keep wondering...
3382005 3385675 ...if Morpheus is so sure,<br />why not take him to see the Oracle?
3386593 3389512 Morpheus will take him<br />when he's ready.
3399314 3400857 The Matrix is a system, Neo.
3402609 3403902 That system is our enemy.
3404527 3406863 But when you're inside,<br />what do you see?
3407113 3410909 Businessmen, teachers,<br />lawyers, carpenters.
3411367 3413953 The very minds of the people<br />we are trying to save.
3414204 3417165 But until we do, these people are<br />a part of that system...
3417415 3419334 ...and that makes them our enemy.
3419501 3420710 You have to understand...
3420960 3424297 ...most of these people are not<br />ready to be unplugged.
3424547 3426132 And many of them are so inert...
3426382 3428802 ...so hopelessly dependent<br />on the system...
3429052 3431763 ...that they will fight to protect it.
3433264 3437018 Were you listening to me or looking<br />at the woman in the red dress?
3437185 3438937 - I was...<br />- Look again.
3440188 3441272 Freeze it.
3447904 3449531 - This isn't the Matrix?<br />- No.
3451324 3455161 It's another training program<br />designed to teach you one thing:
3455787 3458206 If you are not one of us,<br />you are one of them.
3458748 3461543 - What are they?<br />- Sentient programs.
3462293 3466589 They can move in and out of any<br />software still hardwired to their system.
3466965 3470343 That means that anyone<br />we haven't unplugged...
3470677 3472011 ...is potentially an agent.
3472971 3474806 Inside the Matrix...
3475390 3477100 ...they are everyone...
3477433 3479144 ...and they are no one.
3479394 3482522 We have survived by hiding<br />and running from them...
3482772 3484399 ...but they are the gatekeepers.
3484649 3487610 They're guarding all the doors<br />and holding all the keys.
3487861 3490697 Sooner or later, someone will<br />have to fight them.
3490864 3492073 Someone?
3492407 3493825 I won't lie to you, Neo.
3494284 3499122 Every single man or woman who<br />has fought an agent, has died.
3499372 3501749 But where they have failed,<br />you will succeed.
3501916 3503001 Why?
3503251 3505571 I've seen an agent punch<br />through a concrete wall.
3505795 3509382 Men have emptied entire clips at them<br />and hit nothing but air.
3509632 3514262 Yet their strength and speed are still<br />based in a world built on rules.
3514512 3515638 Because of that...
3515889 3519267 ...they will never be as strong<br />or as fast as you can be.
3523563 3525440 What are you telling me?
3526149 3527609 That I can dodge bullets?
3529611 3530987 No, Neo.
3531487 3534407 I'm trying to tell you<br />that when you're ready...
3535283 3536618 ...you won't have to.
3540747 3541956 <i>We got trouble.</i>
3560892 3563353 - Did Zion send the warning?<br />- No, another ship.
3566606 3567899 Shit.
3568149 3571027 - Squiddy's sweeping in quick.<br />- Squiddy?
3571236 3574447 A sentinel. A killing machine<br />designed for one thing.
3574697 3575907 Search and destroy.
3577242 3578409 Set her down there.
3599681 3601182 How are we doing, Tank?
3609899 3611067 Power off-line.
3611567 3613528 EMP armed...
3614070 3615613 - ...and ready.<br />- EMP?
3615905 3617782 Electromagnetic pulse.
3618032 3620910 Disables any electrical system<br />in the blast radius.
3621077 3623371 It's the only weapon we have<br />against the machines.
3629168 3632297 - Where are we?<br />- Their old service and waste systems.
3633548 3634674 Sewers.
3634882 3637593 There used to be cities<br />that spanned hundreds of miles.
3638094 3640013 Now these sewers are<br />all that's left.
3640263 3641597 Quiet.
3682180 3683639 Whoa! Neo.
3685475 3687643 You scared the bejesus out of me.
3688728 3690646 - Sorry.<br />- It's okay.
3693149 3694400 Is that...?
3694650 3696235 The Matrix?
3696402 3697612 Yeah.
3699405 3702575 - Do you always look at it encoded?<br />- Well, you have to.
3702825 3705912 The image translators work<br />for the construct program.
3706162 3709582 But there's way too much information<br />to decode the Matrix.
3709832 3712794 You get used to it.<br />I don't even see the code.
3713044 3716464 All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
3717632 3719008 Do you...
3719300 3720385 ...want a drink?
3720635 3721677 Sure.
3725223 3726682 You know...
3727600 3729143 ...I know what you're thinking.
3729394 3731479 Because right now I'm thinking<br />the same thing.
3731813 3735149 Actually, I've been thinking it<br />ever since I got here.
3737068 3740071 Why, oh, why didn't I take<br />the blue pill?
3752458 3754377 Good shit, huh?
3754710 3755920 Dozer makes it.
3756379 3757547 It's good for two things:
3757797 3760883 Degreasing engines and<br />killing brain cells.
3761884 3764095 So can I ask you something?
3767098 3768724 Did he tell you why he did it?
3771352 3773187 Why you're here?
3776858 3778609 Jesus!
3779819 3781737 What a mind job.
3783156 3785950 So you're here to save the world.
3787452 3789537 What do you say<br />to something like that?
3794709 3796085 A little piece of advice.
3797879 3799297 You see an agent...
3799630 3801924 ...you do what we do:
3802258 3803801 Run.
3804135 3805887 You run your ass off.
3813144 3814854 Thanks for the drink.
3819567 3820735 Sweet dreams.
3824739 3828159 Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
3828826 3829952 You know...
3831370 3833831 ...I know this steak doesn't exist.
3834832 3837585 I know that when I put it<br />in my mouth...
3837835 3840922 ...the Matrix is telling my brain<br />that it is...
3841214 3842340 ...juicy...
3842632 3844342 ...and delicious.
3847261 3848513 After nine years...
3849555 3851098 ...you know what I realize?
3858940 3860149 Ignorance is bliss.
3865196 3867031 Then we have a deal.
3869534 3871452 I don't want to remember nothing.
3871702 3874205 Nothing. You understand?
3878084 3880086 And I want to be rich.
3881420 3884131 You know, someone important.
3885633 3886759 Like an actor.
3887969 3891097 Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
3893266 3894809 Okay.
3895184 3897603 You get my body<br />back in a power plant...
3897979 3899730 ...reinsert me into the Matrix...
3900064 3901482 ...I'll get you what you want.
3901732 3903734 Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
3903985 3906153 No. I told you, I don't know them.
3909115 3911117 I can get you the man who does.
3911867 3913661 Morpheus.
3923754 3927216 Here you go, buddy.<br />Breakfast of champions.
3928551 3931345 Close your eyes, it feels<br />like you're eating runny eggs.
3931554 3933264 Or a bowl of snot.
3933806 3935391 You know what it reminds me of?
3937226 3939562 Tastee Wheat. Did you<br />ever eat Tastee Wheat?
3940187 3941897 No, but technically,<br />neither did you.
3942148 3944191 That's exactly my point. Exactly.
3944442 3945818 Because you have to wonder...
3946068 3949322 ...how do the machines really know<br />what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
3949572 3950990 Maybe they got it wrong.
3951240 3954452 Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat<br />tasted like, actually tasted like...
3954744 3956746 ...oatmeal or tuna fish.
3957121 3959957 That makes you wonder.<br />Take chicken, for example.
3960207 3962247 Maybe they didn't know<br />what to make it taste like...
3962460 3964503 ...which is why it tastes<br />like everything.
3964754 3966547 - And maybe they...<br />- Shut up.
3968174 3969654 It's a single-celled protein...
3969884 3972928 ...combined with synthetic aminos,<br />vitamins and minerals.
3973179 3974430 Everything the body needs.
3974680 3977558 It doesn't have everything<br />the body needs.
3980311 3983397 I understand you've run through<br />the agent training program.
3984440 3986484 You know, I wrote that program.
3986776 3988069 Here it comes.
3988319 3990279 - What did you think of her?<br />- Of who?
3990655 3993699 The woman in the red dress.<br />I designed her.
3994033 3996786 She doesn't talk very much...
3997036 4000998 ...but if you'd like to meet her,<br />I can arrange a more personal milieu.
4001248 4002625 The digital pimp hard at work.
4002875 4005127 Pay no attention to<br />these hypocrites, Neo.
4006420 4008255 To deny our own impulses...
4008506 4011634 ...is to deny the very thing<br />that makes us human.
4013552 4014929 Dozer, when you're done...
4015137 4016737 ...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
4017306 4018641 We're going in.
4019350 4020768 I'm taking Neo to see her.
4024689 4025940 See who?
4026941 4028192 The Oracle.
4033698 4035241 Everyone please observe...
4035574 4038285 ...the "fasten seat belt"<br />and "no smoking" signs are on.
4038786 4042164 Sit back and enjoy your flight.
4066605 4067606 We're in.
4083247 4084415 We'll be back in an hour.
4099180 4101182 Unbelievable...
4101432 4102767 ...isn't it?
4106353 4108189 - God!<br />- What?
4108856 4110232 I used to eat there.
4112485 4114111 Really good noodles.
4118908 4121410 I have these memories from my life.
4123871 4125539 None of them happened.
4126248 4127500 What does that mean?
4127750 4129960 That the Matrix cannot tell you<br />who you are.
4130878 4132087 But an oracle can?
4132546 4133756 That's different.
4138469 4139720 Did you go to her?
4141263 4142431 Yes.
4142932 4144308 What did she tell you?
4147561 4149063 She told me...
4150105 4151273 What?
4155069 4156403 We're here.
4156779 4159073 Neo, come with me.
4179051 4181470 So is this the same oracle<br />that made...
4181637 4182888 ...the prophecy?
4183138 4187476 Yes. She's very old. She's been<br />with us since the beginning.
4187935 4189937 - The beginning?<br />- Of the Resistance.
4192189 4194567 And she knows what? Everything?
4196610 4198529 She would say she knows enough.
4199655 4201448 And she's never wrong.
4203659 4206829 Try not to think of it<br />in terms of right and wrong.
4207162 4208747 She is a guide, Neo.
4209123 4211000 She can help you to find the path.
4211500 4212751 She helped you?
4213460 4214503 Yes.
4215254 4216589 What did she tell you?
4219049 4221260 That I would find the One.
4234398 4236525 I told you I can only<br />show you the door.
4237234 4239320 You have to walk through it.
4243115 4244199 Hello, Neo.
4244450 4246118 You're right on time.
4254043 4257838 Make yourself at home, Morpheus.<br />Neo, come with me.
4263510 4265095 These are the other Potentials.
4265346 4266889 You can wait here.
4307721 4310265 Do not try and bend the spoon.
4310641 4312768 That's impossible.
4313602 4317606 Instead, only try<br />to realize the truth.
4318148 4319525 What truth?
4319775 4321443 There is no spoon.
4324029 4325364 There is no spoon?
4325614 4330077 Then you'll see that it is not the spoon<br />that bends. It is only yourself.
4346135 4347594 The Oracle will you see now.
4358313 4359857 I know you're Neo.
4360482 4361650 Be right with you.
4362693 4365070 - You're the Oracle?<br />- Bingo.
4367781 4370659 Not quite what you<br />were expecting, right?
4371702 4373871 Almost done.
4376373 4378000 Smell good, don't they?
4379251 4380502 Yeah.
4380753 4382588 I'd ask you to sit down...
4382838 4385215 ...but you're not going to anyway.
4385716 4388594 - And don't worry about the vase.<br />- What vase?
4391722 4392890 That vase.
4393849 4394892 I'm sorry.
4395142 4397019 I said, don't worry about it.
4398187 4400147 I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
4400773 4401982 How did you know?
4404026 4407821 What's really going to bake<br />your noodle later on is...
4408155 4411116 ...would you still have broken it<br />if I hadn't said anything?
4415913 4417831 You're cuter than I thought.
4420876 4423128 I can see why she likes you.
4424004 4425089 Who?
4425339 4427174 Not too bright, though.
4430469 4433555 You know why Morpheus<br />brought you to see me.
4435682 4436850 So...
4437810 4439186 ...what do you think?
4441021 4442773 Do you think you are the One?
4444733 4445776 I don't know.
4449196 4450614 You know what that means?
4451448 4452616 It's Latin.
4452991 4455202 Means, "Know thyself."
4456662 4458622 I'll let you in on a little secret.
4460874 4464711 Being the One is just<br />like being in love.
4465420 4468298 No one can tell you you're in love.<br />You just know it...
4468549 4469675 ...through and through.
4470008 4472052 Balls to bones.
4474388 4475430 Well...
4477391 4479476 ...I'd better have a look at you.
4480811 4482312 Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
4496702 4498370 Okay...
4498996 4503959 Now I'm supposed to say,<br />"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."
4504459 4505586 Then you say:
4506253 4507462 But what?
4507713 4511675 But you already know<br />what I'm going to tell you.
4513093 4516054 - I'm not the One.<br />- Sorry, kid.
4517681 4519683 You got the gift...
4520601 4522895 ...but it looks like<br />you're waiting for something.
4527566 4528609 What?
4528859 4531737 Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
4532321 4534573 That's the way these things go.
4535449 4538035 - What's funny?<br />- Morpheus.
4541496 4543207 He almost had me convinced.
4543457 4544583 I know.
4546126 4548253 Poor Morpheus.
4550631 4553759 Without him, we're lost.
4555302 4557471 What do you mean, "without him"?
4561475 4563393 Are you sure you want<br />to hear this?
4565604 4568357 Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
4570067 4572236 And no one, not you, not even me...
4572486 4574738 ...can convince him otherwise.
4575113 4577491 He believes it so blindly...
4577783 4582120 ...that he's going to sacrifice<br />his life to save yours.
4582329 4583497 What?
4583664 4586333 You're going to<br />have to make a choice.
4586959 4590545 In the one hand,<br />you'll have Morpheus' life.
4591046 4593924 And in the other hand,<br />you'll have your own.
4595342 4597636 One of you is going to die.
4599721 4603016 Which one will be up to you.
4604393 4606311 I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
4606561 4608230 You have a good soul.
4609314 4612025 And I hate giving<br />good people bad news.
4615153 4616613 Don't worry about it.
4616863 4619283 As soon as you<br />step outside that door...
4619533 4621660 ...you'll start feeling better.
4622369 4626164 You'll remember you don't believe<br />in any of this fate crap.
4626999 4629751 You're in control of your own life.
4630585 4631878 Remember?
4633547 4634756 Here...
4636633 4638176 ...take a cookie.
4638719 4642055 I promise, by the time<br />you're done eating it...
4643015 4645392 ...you'll feel right as rain.
4654609 4655944 What was said...
4656570 4658030 ...was for you...
4658572 4660407 ...and for you alone.
4683347 4684431 They're on the way.
4714252 4715295 What is that?
4730060 4731478 Oh, déjà vu.
4734981 4736066 What did you just say?
4736316 4737818 Nothing. Just déjà vu.
4738068 4739988 - What did you see?<br />- What happened?
4741113 4743281 A black cat went past us...
4743532 4745158 ...then another just like it.
4745409 4746952 Was it the same cat?
4747911 4750747 - I'm not sure.<br />- Switch, Apoc.
4754835 4756044 What is it?
4756294 4760715 A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the<br />Matrix when they change something.
4763677 4764928 Oh, my God.
4766721 4767722 Let's go.
4772978 4774771 They cut the hard line.<br />It's a trap! Get out!
4780235 4781486 Oh, no.
4821776 4824237 That's what they changed.<br />We're trapped.
4824488 4826364 Be calm. Give me your phone.
4826615 4828158 They'll be able to track it.
4828408 4829826 We have no choice.
4831244 4832454 Operator.
4832787 4835624 <i>Find a structural drawing of<br />this building. Find it fast.</i>
4843465 4846051 - Got it!<br /><i>- I need the main wet-wall.</i>
4848887 4850138 Eighth floor.
4850347 4851932 <i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>
4852224 4853683 Switch, straight ahead.
4854434 4855602 Neo...
4861733 4863860 I hope the Oracle<br />gave you some good news.
4872160 4873662 <i>Now left. That's it.</i>
4873954 4874996 Good.
4884714 4886007 Where are they?
4946443 4947611 They're in the walls.
4949070 4950238 In the walls!
4971635 4973303 It's an agent!
4980602 4981936 Morpheus!
4982103 4983355 You must get Neo out!
4983605 4985440 He's all that matters!
4985732 4987942 - No, Morpheus! Don't!<br />- Trinity, go!
4988902 4990236 Go!
4996493 4998411 - We can't leave him!<br />- We have to!
5022727 5024521 Cypher, come on!
5029442 5033279 The great Morpheus.<br />We meet at last.
5033822 5034948 And you are?
5035198 5036950 A Smith.
5037200 5038493 Agent Smith.
5039077 5041121 You all look the same to me.
5096760 5098052 Take him.
5104684 5106144 No!
5111274 5113109 - Operator.<br /><i>- I need an exit, fast.</i>
5115195 5118114 There was an accident.<br />Goddamn car accident.
5118448 5120241 <i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>
5120492 5121868 Somebody up there still likes me.
5122118 5123369 I got you.
5123870 5125789 <i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>
5126039 5128708 Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.<br />An old TV repair shop.
5128958 5130001 Right.
5133129 5134714 - Operator.<br /><i>- Tank, it's me.</i>
5134964 5136132 Is Morpheus alive?
5136508 5137801 Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
5138218 5140136 <i>Yes. They're moving him.<br />I don't know where.</i>
5140345 5142639 He's alive. We need an exit.
5142889 5143973 You're not far from Cypher.
5144140 5145391 <i>- Cypher?</i><br />- I know.
5145642 5147727 <i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i><br />- Got it.
5156820 5158029 Got him.
5168957 5169999 Where are they?
5170250 5171501 Making the call.
5172168 5173336 Good.
5186474 5187725 You first.
5190937 5192146 Shit!
5195441 5197110 Tank!
5197277 5198903 No!
5200822 5202991 I don't know. It just went dead.
5229809 5231019 <i>Hello, Trinity.</i>
5231436 5232770 Cypher? Where's Tank?
5238359 5239402 You know...
5241112 5243239 ...for a long time...
5244449 5247327 ...I thought I was in love with you.
5248119 5250163 <i>I used to dream about you.</i>
5251247 5253958 You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
5254208 5256586 <i>Too bad things had to<br />turn out this way.</i>
5257128 5258171 You killed them.
5258671 5260173 - What?<br />- Oh, God.
5260423 5261841 I'm tired, Trinity.
5263259 5265136 I'm tired of this war...
5265428 5268264 ...tired of fighting.<br />I'm tired of this ship...
5268598 5273227 ...of being cold, of eating<br />the same goddamn goop every day.
5275438 5276564 But most of all...
5277148 5280526 <i>...I'm tired of that jackoff<br />and all of his bullshit.</i>
5281653 5282946 Surprise, asshole!
5283488 5285698 I bet you never saw this coming...
5285949 5286991 ...did you?
5289285 5291663 God, I wish I could be there...
5292246 5293748 ...when they break you.
5294791 5297961 I wish I could walk in<br />just when it happens...
5298670 5300380 ...so right then...
5300630 5301965 ...you'd know it was me.
5302465 5303633 You gave them Morpheus.
5303883 5305343 <i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>
5305927 5307428 He tricked us!
5307971 5309973 If you had told us the truth...
5310223 5313101 ...we would've told you to shove<br />that red pill up your ass!
5313351 5315478 That is not true, Cypher.<br />He set us free.
5315728 5318606 "Free." You call this free?
5321025 5323528 All I do is what he tells me to do.
5325113 5328032 If I had to choose between<br />that and the Matrix...
5329200 5330410 ...I choose the Matrix.
5330660 5332328 The Matrix isn't real.
5332578 5333997 <i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>
5334247 5336499 I think the Matrix...
5336833 5339419 ...can be more real than this world.
5341587 5344090 All I do is pull the plug here.
5344465 5345675 But there...
5346217 5348511 <i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
5349512 5350763 Trinity.
5356269 5359230 <i>- Welcome to the real world.</i><br />- But you're out, Cypher.
5359480 5361899 <i>- You can't go back.</i><br />- That's what you think.
5362150 5363651 <i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>
5363901 5367530 <i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,<br />I won't remember a thing.</i>
5367739 5368781 By the way...
5369032 5371993 ...if you have anything important<br />to say to Switch...
5372493 5373578 <i>...say it now.</i>
5373828 5376873 - No, please don't.<br />- Not like this.
5378583 5380209 Not like this.
5384672 5385715 Too late.
5386466 5387759 Goddamn you, Cypher!
5388009 5389886 Don't hate me, Trinity.
5390261 5392138 I'm just a messenger.
5392555 5395725 And right now,<br />I'm going to prove it to you.
5396809 5398478 If Morpheus was right...
5399020 5400897 ...there's no way<br />I can pull this plug.
5401481 5402982 <i>If Neo's the One...</i>
5403483 5405318 <i>...then there'd have to be...</i>
5405568 5408154 ...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
5408321 5409530 Right?
5410156 5412241 I mean, how can he be the One...
5412408 5413493 ...if he's dead?
5414869 5417121 <i>You never did answer me before...</i>
5417413 5419749 <i>...if you bought into<br />Morpheus' bullshit.</i>
5420124 5423336 Come on. All I want<br />is a little yes or no.
5424712 5427048 Look into his eyes...
5427799 5429300 <i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>
5432053 5433387 ...and tell me...
5434097 5435348 <i>...yes...</i>
5435681 5437058 <i>...or no.</i>
5438351 5439894 - Yes.<br /><i>- No!</i>
5440061 5441229 I don't believe it.
5442647 5447401 Believe it or not, you piece of shit,<br />you're still going to burn!
5465670 5467046 You first.
5475263 5477557 - You're hurt.<br />- I'll be all right.
5480351 5481519 Dozer?
5499787 5502165 Have you ever stood and stared at it?
5503040 5506169 Marveled at its beauty...
5506544 5508796 ...its genius?
5509964 5511841 Billions of people...
5512091 5514844 ...just living out their lives.
5515887 5517555 Oblivious.
5522143 5525021 Did you know that the first Matrix...
5525271 5529942 ...was designed to be a perfect<br />human world where none suffered...
5530443 5533362 ...where everyone would be happy.
5533905 5535406 It was a disaster.
5535656 5539994 No one would accept the program.<br />Entire crops were lost.
5540870 5542622 Some believe that...
5542872 5547251 ...we lacked the programming language<br />to describe your perfect world.
5547501 5549045 But I believe that...
5549212 5550379 ...as a species...
5550630 5554467 ...human beings define<br />their reality through misery...
5554717 5556093 ...and suffering.
5556344 5559055 So the perfect world was a dream...
5559305 5564143 ...that your primitive cerebrum<br />kept trying to wake up from.
5565478 5569148 Which is why the Matrix was<br />redesigned to this.
5569607 5571108 The peak...
5571359 5572777 ...of your civilization.
5573027 5575279 I say, "your civilization"...
5575529 5579659 ...because when we started thinking<br />for you, it became our civilization...
5579909 5582995 ...which is, of course,<br />what this is all about.
5584330 5586916 Evolution, Morpheus.
5587208 5588542 Evolution.
5590836 5592713 Like the dinosaur.
5594882 5596509 Look out that window.
5597218 5599345 You had your time.
5600054 5603975 The future is our world, Morpheus.
5604308 5606686 The future is our time.
5610940 5612108 There could be a problem.
5613025 5616404 - What are they doing to him?<br />- They're breaking into his mind.
5616654 5618823 It's like hacking a computer.<br />All it takes is time.
5619073 5620283 How much time?
5620533 5623661 Depends on the mind.<br />But eventually, it'll crack...
5623911 5628332 ...and his alpha patterns<br />will change from this to this.
5628582 5631544 When it does, he'll tell them<br />anything they want to know.
5631794 5632837 What do they want?
5633087 5637133 The leader of every ship is given<br />codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
5637383 5640303 If an agent got the codes<br />and got into Zion's mainframe...
5640553 5643639 ...they could destroy us.<br />We can't let that happen.
5643806 5646058 Trinity, Zion's more important than me...
5646225 5647393 ...or you...
5647560 5648853 ...or even Morpheus.
5652648 5654317 There has to be<br />something we can do.
5654734 5656736 There is. We pull the plug.
5659822 5661574 You're going to kill him?
5661824 5662992 Kill Morpheus?
5663617 5665244 We don't have a choice.
5672043 5674962 Never send a human<br />to do a machine's job.
5675212 5676964 If the insider has failed...
5677214 5680426 ...they'll sever the connection<br />as soon as possible, unless...
5680676 5682386 They're dead. In either case...
5682636 5686182 We have no choice. Continue as planned.<br />Deploy the sentinels.
5686432 5687516 Immediately.
5692772 5695441 Morpheus, you were more<br />than a leader to us.
5696400 5698611 You were a father.
5700154 5702114 We'll miss you always.
5708996 5710206 Stop!
5711374 5712734 I don't believe this is happening.
5712875 5714919 - Neo, this has to be done.<br />- Does it?
5715711 5717088 I don't know.
5717421 5719882 - This can't be just coincidence.<br />- What?
5720091 5721342 The Oracle.
5721592 5723386 She told me this would happen.
5723803 5727973 She told me that I would<br />have to make a choice.
5728432 5729642 What choice?
5732645 5735147 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm going in.
5735481 5737817 - No, you're not.<br />- I have to.
5738025 5741654 Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself<br />so that we could get you out.
5741904 5743823 There is no way<br />that you're going back in.
5744407 5747660 Morpheus did what he did because<br />he believed I'm something I'm not.
5749161 5750204 What?
5750913 5752540 I'm not the One, Trinity.
5752915 5755876 - The Oracle hit me with that too.<br />- No, you have to be.
5756127 5758796 I'm sorry, I'm not.<br />I'm just another guy.
5759463 5760714 No, Neo, that's not true.
5761298 5763926 - It can't be true.<br />- Why?
5768347 5771684 This is loco. They've got Morpheus<br />in a military-controlled building.
5771934 5776313 Even if you somehow got inside, those<br />are agents holding him. Three of them.
5777606 5781527 I want Morpheus back too, but<br />what you're talking about is suicide.
5781777 5783362 That's what it looks like...
5783529 5784572 ...but it's not.
5784822 5787199 I can't explain to you why it's not.
5788284 5791996 Morpheus believed something, and<br />he was ready to give his life for it.
5792246 5795249 I understand that now.<br />That's why I have to go.
5795541 5798043 - Why?<br />- Because I believe in something.
5798210 5799837 What?
5800546 5802256 I believe I can bring him back.
5819231 5821150 - What are you doing?<br />- Going with you.
5821442 5823444 - No, you're not.<br />- "No"?
5824612 5826739 Let me tell you what I believe.
5827239 5829617 Morpheus means more to me<br />than he does to you.
5829950 5834246 I believe if you are serious about<br />saving him, you will need my help.
5834497 5836540 And since I am the ranking officer...
5836790 5839668 ...if you don't like it,<br />I believe you can go to hell.
5840419 5842838 Because you aren't going anywhere else.
5843255 5844798 Tank...
5844965 5846091 ...load us up.
5855726 5859021 I'd like to share<br />a revelation that I've had...
5859438 5860981 ...during my time here.
5861232 5865236 It came to me when I tried<br />to classify your species...
5865486 5867738 ...and I realized...
5867988 5870282 ...that you're not actually mammals.
5872493 5874954 Every mammal on this planet...
5875287 5880209 ...instinctively develops an equilibrium<br />with the surrounding environment.
5880459 5882294 But you humans do not.
5882836 5886382 You move to an area<br />and you multiply...
5886632 5891136 ...and multiply until every<br />natural resource is consumed.
5891470 5893556 The only way you can survive...
5893847 5896809 ...is to spread to another area.
5902231 5905109 There is another organism<br />on this planet...
5905359 5907319 ...that follows the same pattern.
5907945 5909613 Do you know what it is?
5909989 5911824 A virus.
5913158 5916203 Human beings are a disease.
5916579 5918122 A cancer of this planet.
5918372 5920499 You are a plague.
5921041 5922459 And we...
5922626 5924003 ...are the cure.
5925004 5926422 Okay, so what do you need?
5927047 5928173 Besides a miracle.
5928757 5929967 Guns.
5930801 5932011 Lots of guns.
5941895 5943105 Neo...
5944857 5947401 No one has ever done<br />anything like this.
5948611 5950529 That's why it's going to work.
5954617 5956535 Why isn't the serum working?
5957161 5959455 Perhaps we're asking<br />the wrong questions.
5961540 5962791 Leave me with him.
5965377 5966503 Now.
5977723 5979308 Hold on, Morpheus.
5979558 5982269 They're coming for you.<br />They're coming.
5984647 5986774 Can you hear me, Morpheus?
5987024 5989693 I'm going to be honest...
5990069 5991278 ...with you.
5995658 5997076 I...
5997951 5999078 ...hate...
5999328 6001288 ...this place...
6001622 6003916 ...this zoo...
6004166 6005292 ...this prison...
6005542 6008712 ...this reality,<br />whatever you want to call it.
6008962 6011256 I can't stand it any longer.
6012007 6013884 It's the smell.
6015260 6017137 If there is such a thing.
6017471 6020766 I feel saturated by it.
6022267 6023560 I can...
6023811 6025354 ...taste...
6025521 6027564 ...your stink.
6027815 6031443 And every time I do, I fear that<br />I have somehow been infected by it.
6031610 6032611 It's repulsive.
6033612 6034988 Isn't it?
6037157 6039451 I must get out of here.
6039868 6042079 I must get free.
6042329 6045207 And in this mind is the key.
6045457 6047126 My key.
6047376 6050254 Once Zion is destroyed,<br />there is no need for me to be here.
6050504 6052131 Do you understand?
6052423 6053799 I need the codes.
6054049 6056385 I have to get inside Zion...
6056719 6059221 ...and you have to tell me how.
6059638 6061515 You're going to tell me...
6061765 6063934 ...or you're going to die.
6084121 6087249 Please remove any metallic items<br />you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
6091170 6092212 Holy shit!
6104308 6107019 Backup. Send backup.
6130834 6131960 Freeze!
6266803 6268013 What were you doing?
6269848 6271141 He doesn't know.
6271391 6272893 Know what?
6300963 6303465 I think they're trying to save him.
6318313 6320065 There is no spoon.
6349678 6351847 Find them and destroy them!
6353473 6355308 We're under attack!
6387424 6388592 Trinity!
6389092 6390177 Help!
6412199 6413408 Only human.
6414367 6415452 Dodge this.
6428673 6430175 - How did you do that?<br />- Do what?
6430592 6434513 You moved like they do.<br />I've never seen anyone move that fast.
6435639 6437015 It wasn't fast enough.
6439768 6441061 Can you fly that thing?
6442187 6443188 Not yet.
6446483 6447526 Operator.
6447734 6450904 <i>I need a pilot program<br />for a B-212 helicopter.</i>
6451363 6452656 <i>Hurry.</i>
6460580 6462207 Let's go.
6477305 6478390 No.
6529983 6532611 Morpheus, get up.<br />Get up, get up.
6570649 6571691 He's not going to make it.
6581493 6582535 Got you.
6648601 6649769 Trinity!
6691436 6692854 I knew it.
6693480 6694689 He's the One.
6710663 6712874 Do you believe it now, Trinity?
6715752 6716920 Morpheus...
6718588 6719672 The Oracle.
6720924 6723301 - She told me...<br />- She told you...
6723676 6725261 ...what you needed to hear.
6725553 6726888 That's all.
6727931 6730892 Sooner or later you'll realize,<br />just as I did...
6731226 6733520 ...there's a difference<br />between knowing the path...
6734270 6735563 ...and walking the path.
6738608 6739818 Operator. MORPHEUS: <i>Tank.</i>
6740735 6743279 - It's good to hear your voice.<br /><i>- We need an exit.</i>
6743530 6746324 Got one ready. Subway station,<br />State and Balboa.
6759379 6761798 - Damn it!<br />- The trace was completed.
6762048 6765635 - We have their position.<br />- Sentinels are standing by.
6767345 6768847 Order the strike.
6775395 6777397 They're not out yet.
6788575 6789909 You first, Morpheus.
6810597 6812891 Neo, I want to tell you something...
6816144 6820106 ...but I'm afraid of<br />what it could mean if I do.
6823693 6826988 Everything the Oracle<br />told me has come true.
6829741 6831284 Everything but this.
6832785 6833828 But what?
6858728 6859896 Neo!
6860146 6861773 - What happened?<br />- An agent.
6862023 6863942 - Send me back.<br />- I can't.
6865985 6867946 Mr. Anderson.
6870156 6871533 Run, Neo. Run.
6876829 6878456 What is he doing?
6878706 6879958 He's beginning to believe.
6906943 6908319 You're empty.
6908903 6910196 So are you.
6943354 6946357 I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
6947483 6948526 ...Mr. Anderson.
6989484 6991569 Jesus, he's killing him.
7077739 7079866 You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
7080616 7083619 That is the sound of inevitability.
7086205 7089542 It is the sound of your death.
7090460 7092795 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7093045 7094672 My name...
7097675 7099719 ...is Neo.
7131959 7134170 - What happened?<br />- I don't know. I lost him.
7136672 7137715 Oh, shit.
7150102 7151562 Sentinels.
7152313 7154565 - How long?<br />- Five, maybe six minutes.
7156609 7158778 Tank, charge the EMP.
7159028 7162073 - We can't use that until he's out.<br />- I know. Don't worry.
7163241 7164325 He's gonna make it.
7164575 7166452 Flat or pumps? No, just...
7166702 7169580 What the shit? That's my phone!
7169997 7171582 That guy took my phone!
7173960 7176254 Got him! He's on the run.
7176504 7179173 Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!
7179423 7181300 <i>I got an old exit.<br />Wabash and Lake.</i>
7185263 7186264 Oh, shit!
7207827 7209829 Help! Need a little help!
7211455 7212665 <i>The door.</i>
7228639 7230141 <i>The door on your left.</i>
7231058 7232310 <i>Your other left!</i>
7239025 7240276 <i>The back door.</i>
7261047 7262173 Oh, no.
7263841 7265343 Here they come.
7294121 7295373 He's going to make it.
7305591 7308719 <i>The fire escape at the end<br />of the alley, room 303.</i>
7343838 7344922 They're inside.
7347258 7348300 Hurry, Neo.
7404523 7405649 It can't be.
7413449 7414825 Check him.
7418829 7420372 He's gone.
7427088 7429507 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7437098 7438140 Neo...
7439600 7441560 I'm not afraid anymore.
7443187 7444522 The Oracle told me...
7444688 7450111 ...I'd fall in love, and that<br />the man I loved would be the One.
7453239 7455199 So you see...
7455908 7457910 ...you can't be dead.
7459495 7461330 You can't be...
7462873 7465042 ...because I love you.
7466877 7468587 You hear me?
7469713 7471382 I love you.
7495114 7496407 Now, get up.
7505082 7506250 No.
7532985 7534028 How?
7534904 7535946 He is the One.
7622700 7624159 Neo!
7680424 7682134 <i>I know you're out there.</i>
7682384 7684219 <i>I can feel you now.</i>
7684636 7688265 <i>I know that you're afraid.<br />You're afraid of us.</i>
7688599 7690434 <i>You're afraid of change.</i>
7691894 7693228 <i>I don't know the future.</i>
7693395 7695981 <i>I didn't come here to tell you<br />how this is going to end.</i>
7696231 7699193 <i>I came here to tell you<br />how it's going to begin.</i>
7700152 7701737 <i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>
7701987 7705074 <i>And then I'll show these people<br />what you don't want them to see.</i>
7705324 7707201 <i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>
7707451 7709203 <i>...without you.</i>
7709495 7713123 <i>A world without rules and controls,<br />without borders or boundaries.</i>
7713374 7717086 <i>A world where anything is possible.</i>
7719713 7721048 <i>Where we go from there...</i>
7721298 7723258 <i>...is a choice I leave to you.</i>
