48444 51864 <i>- Is everything in place?<br />- You're not to relieve me.</i>
52114 54742 <i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>
55284 57662 <i>You like him, don't you?<br />You like watching him.</i>
57912 60915 <i>- Don't be ridiculous.<br />- We're going to kill him.</i>
61165 63626 <i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>
63793 64836 <i>Do you?</i>
65002 66838 <i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>
67088 68714 <i>You don't, do you?</i>
68965 71050 <i>- Did you hear that?<br />- Hear what?</i>
71259 72885 <i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>
73135 75137 <i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>
75471 76931 <i>I better go.</i>
114887 116680 - Freeze! Police!<br />- Hands on your head!
117222 118307 Do it! Do it now!
139703 142331 - Lieutenant.<br />- Oh, shit.
143165 146376 Lieutenant, you were given<br />specific orders.
146627 148337 I'm just doing my job.
148962 153383 You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"<br />crap, you can cram it up your ass.
153842 156345 The orders were for your protection.
157846 160057 I think we can handle one little girl.
165187 166939 I sent two units!
167189 168774 They're bringing her down now!
169024 172152 No, lieutenant, your men<br />are already dead.
201223 202307 Shit.
205227 207312 Morpheus, the line was traced.<br />I don't know how.
207562 209189 <i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>
209398 211566 <i>There's no time.<br />Get to another exit.</i>
211817 214236 - Are there any agents?<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
214444 215613 Goddamn it.
215863 217407 <i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>
217657 220034 <i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>
220410 222078 <i>You can make it.</i>
222328 223997 - All right.<br /><i>- Go.</i>
286142 287185 That's impossible.
322178 324181 Get up, Trinity. Just get up.
324848 326058 Get up.
371937 373438 She got out.
373730 375023 It doesn't matter.
375274 378443 - The informant is real.<br />- Yes.
378610 380362 We have the name of their next target.
380612 382281 The name is Neo.
385576 387077 We'll need a search running.
387369 389288 It has already begun.
444052 445261 What?
451017 452518 What the hell?
460151 462111 "Follow the white rabbit."
473957 475124 Who is it?
475375 476668 It's Choi.
481798 483633 Yeah. Yeah.
490181 491349 You're two hours late.
491933 493685 I know. It's her fault.
493851 494936 You got the money?
497063 498231 Two grand.
499107 500233 Hold on.
517917 519294 Hallelujah.
519544 522422 You're my savior.<br />My own personal Jesus Christ.
522672 524549 You get caught using that...
524799 526926 I know. This never happened.<br />You don't exist.
528052 530138 - Right.<br />- Something wrong, man?
530388 532432 You look a little whiter than usual.
533558 535727 My computer, it...
538731 543277 Ever have that feeling where you're<br />not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
544069 546822 All the time.<br />It's called mescaline.
547323 549450 It's the only way to fly.
550326 552828 It just sounds like you<br />need to unplug.
553579 555581 Get some R and R?
555998 559752 What do you think, Dujour?<br />Should we take him with us?
561754 562963 Definitely.
563213 566300 No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.
566925 568052 Come on.
568302 570929 It'll be fun. I promise.
577436 578937 Yeah.
579772 581607 Sure. I'll go.
609218 610302 Hello, Neo.
611637 612805 How do you know that name?
613639 615349 I know a lot about you.
616225 618310 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
619269 620479 Trinity.
622106 623273 The Trinity?
623732 625442 That cracked the IRS D-base?
625692 627152 That was a long time ago.
627403 629321 - Jesus.<br />- What?
629780 631573 I just thought...
633325 634493 you were a guy.
634743 636203 Most guys do.
637413 639623 That was you on my computer.
640249 641333 How did you do that?
642000 644711 Right now, all I can tell you...
645337 646881 is that you're in danger.
647340 649759 - I brought you here to warn you.<br />- Of what?
650343 652011 They're watching you, Neo.
652595 655014 - Who is?<br />- Please just listen.
658518 660353 I know why you're here, Neo.
661146 663106 I know what you've been doing.
663356 665233 I know why you hardly sleep...
665525 668653 why you live alone and why,<br />night after night...
668903 671239 you sit at your computer.
672407 673950 You're looking for him.
674742 677745 I know, because I was once<br />looking for the same thing.
678246 680373 And when he found me...
680999 684085 he told me I wasn't really<br />looking for him...
685003 686754 I was looking for an answer.
687380 690508 It's the question that drives us, Neo.
691176 693845 It's the question<br />that brought you here.
695930 697307 You know the question...
697557 699058 just as I did.
700602 702228 What is the Matrix?
702479 704939 The answer is out there, Neo.
705607 707609 It's looking for you.
708401 710069 And it will find you...
710361 712363 if you want it to.
719078 720121 Shit.
720288 721498 Shit, shit.
731758 734594 You have a problem with authority,<br />Mr. Anderson.
734844 738890 You believe that you are special,<br />that the rules do not apply to you.
739599 741601 Obviously, you are mistaken.
744562 747440 This is one of the top<br />software companies in the world...
747690 751069 because employees understand<br />they are part of a whole.
751319 755950 Thus, if an employee has a problem,<br />the company has a problem.
758202 761413 The time has come to make<br />a choice, Mr. Anderson.
762289 766168 Either you choose to be at your desk<br />on time from this day forth...
766794 769380 or you choose to find another job.
770256 771590 Do I make myself clear?
771840 774260 Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.<br />Perfectly clear.
782393 783602 Thomas Anderson?
785854 787273 Yeah, that's me.
788065 789275 Okay.
795281 796448 Great.
797866 799034 Have a nice day.
814508 815551 Hello?
815843 819179 <i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>
821432 823183 - Morpheus.<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
823434 825436 <i>I've been looking for you.</i>
825686 828856 <i>I don't know if you're ready to see<br />what I want to show you.</i>
829106 832276 <i>But unfortunately, you and I<br />have run out of time.</i>
832526 836238 <i>They're coming for you, and I don't know<br />what they're going to do.</i>
836488 837823 Who's coming for me?
838073 840159 <i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>
840409 841910 What? Right now?
842202 844705 <i>Yes. Now.</i>
845581 847458 <i>Do it slowly.</i>
847875 849084 <i>The elevator.</i>
853964 855758 - Oh, shit!<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
860429 861514 What do they want?
861681 865018 <i>I don't know. If you don't want<br />to find out, get out of there.</i>
865185 866227 How?
866436 869606 <i>I can guide you,<br />but you must do exactly as I say.</i>
869814 872484 - Okay.<br /><i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>
875612 877739 - But what if they...<br /><i>- Go. Now.</i>
884496 886873 <i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>
894089 896841 <i>When I tell you,<br />go to the end of the row...</i>
897092 899052 <i>to the office<br />at the end of the hall.</i>
899302 901680 <i>Stay as low as you can.</i>
903973 905100 <i>Go. Now.</i>
919489 923034 <i>Good. Now, outside<br />there is a scaffold.</i>
925745 928081 - How do you know this?<br /><i>- We don't have time.</i>
928331 931167 <i>To your left there's a window.<br />Go to it.</i>
933420 934963 <i>Open it.</i>
935797 937590 <i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>
937841 940427 No way! No way!<br />This is crazy!
940677 943054 <i>There are two ways<br />out of this building.</i>
943304 947100 <i>One is that scaffold.<br />The other is in their custody.</i>
947350 950562 <i>You take a chance either way.<br />I leave it to you.</i>
954149 955900 This is insane!
957068 958945 Why is this happening to me?
959237 960864 What'd I do?
961239 963992 I'm nobody.<br />I didn't do anything.
964576 966035 I'm gonna die.
975838 976881 Shit!
997151 998277 Oh, shit!
1003240 1005034 I can't do this.
1017671 1018714 Shit.
1067972 1072810 As you can see, we've had our eye on<br />you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
1074103 1076773 It seems that you've been living...
1077023 1079150 two lives.
1080569 1083071 In one life,<br />you're Thomas A. Anderson...
1083321 1086658 program writer for<br />a respectable software company.
1087701 1090996 You have a social security number.<br />You pay your taxes.
1091454 1092706 And you...
1094291 1097919 help your landlady<br />carry out her garbage.
1100422 1103550 The other life is lived in computers...
1103842 1106803 where you go by<br />the hacker alias "Neo"...
1107053 1111850 and are guilty of virtually every<br />computer crime we have a law for.
1113143 1115103 One of these lives...
1115353 1117188 has a future.
1117522 1119524 And one of them does not.
1123236 1127073 I'm going to be as forthcoming<br />as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
1128074 1129409 You're here...
1129743 1131995 because we need your help.
1135624 1138627 We know that you've been contacted<br />by a certain...
1138877 1140670 individual.
1141588 1145634 A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
1146635 1150639 Whatever you think you know<br />about this man is irrelevant.
1150889 1153308 He is considered by many authorities...
1153558 1156603 to be the most dangerous man alive.
1159314 1160523 My colleagues...
1160982 1163902 believe that I am wasting<br />my time with you.
1164194 1167614 But I believe you wish<br />to do the right thing.
1167906 1171409 We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
1171785 1173912 give you a fresh start.
1174412 1177332 All we're asking in return<br />is your cooperation...
1177582 1181086 in bringing<br />a known terrorist to justice.
1182462 1183713 Yeah.
1185007 1187093 That sounds like a really good deal.
1188719 1190471 But I got a better one.
1190721 1192223 How about...
1192640 1194642 I give you the finger...
1197228 1199230 and you give me my phone call.
1201440 1203275 Mr. Anderson...
1207446 1208489 you disappoint me.
1208739 1211367 You can't scare me<br />with this gestapo crap.
1211617 1212994 I know my rights.
1213244 1214745 I want my phone call.
1215329 1217498 Tell me, Mr. Anderson...
1218374 1219792 what good is a phone call...
1220042 1223629 if you're unable to speak?
1257413 1259623 You're going to help us,<br />Mr. Anderson...
1260124 1262293 whether you want to or not.
1320727 1323980 <i>This line is tapped,<br />so I must be brief.</i>
1324231 1328527 <i>They got to you first, but they've<br />underestimated how important you are.</i>
1328777 1330612 <i>If they knew what I know...</i>
1330862 1332864 <i>you would probably be dead.</i>
1333865 1337577 What are you talking about?<br />What is happening to me?
1337828 1342666 <i>You are the One, Neo. You may have<br />spent the last few years...</i>
1342916 1345877 <i>looking for me, but I've spent<br />my entire life...</i>
1346128 1347629 <i>looking for you.</i>
1349172 1351341 <i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>
1352300 1355178 - Yes.<br /><i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>
1365397 1366606 Get in.
1378660 1379703 What's this?
1379953 1382497 It's necessary, Neo.<br />For our protection.
1382747 1384916 - From what?<br />- From you.
1386459 1387919 - Take off your shirt.<br />- What?
1388086 1389254 Stop the car.
1393842 1395010 Listen, coppertop.
1395260 1397262 We don't have time for 20 Questions.
1397762 1400141 Right now, there's only one rule:
1400433 1401767 Our way...
1402101 1403186 or the highway.
1409734 1410818 Fine.
1412695 1415156 Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
1415740 1418367 - Why?<br />- Because you have been down there.
1419118 1420328 You know that road.
1421329 1422955 You know exactly where it ends.
1425166 1427418 And I know that's<br />not where you want to be.
1441599 1443142 Apoc, lights.
1445645 1447813 Lie back.<br />Lift up your shirt.
1449732 1451984 - What's that?<br />- You're bugged.
1459742 1461202 Try and relax.
1467500 1468668 Come on.
1469710 1470753 Come on.
1472505 1473506 It's on the move.
1475299 1476509 Come on, you shit.
1478344 1480596 - You're gonna lose it.<br />- No, I'm not.
1480763 1481847 Clear!
1490439 1492566 Jesus Christ!<br />That thing's real!?
1526310 1527644 This is it.
1530981 1533442 Let me give you one piece of advice.
1534401 1536069 Be honest.
1537654 1539865 He knows more than you can imagine.
1548582 1549916 At last.
1551460 1552544 Welcome, Neo.
1553754 1555672 As you no doubt have guessed...
1555922 1557174 I am Morpheus.
1558216 1559801 It's an honor to meet you.
1560260 1561303 No...
1561887 1563180 the honor is mine.
1564097 1566600 Please, come. Sit.
1581698 1583325 I imagine...
1583742 1586495 that right now you're feeling<br />a bit like Alice...
1588205 1590624 tumbling down the rabbit hole?
1591458 1592542 You could say that.
1593460 1596088 I can see it in your eyes.
1596671 1599966 You have the look of a man<br />who accepts what he sees...
1600217 1602469 because he's expecting to wake up.
1603887 1606473 Ironically, this is not<br />far from the truth.
1607182 1609559 Do you believe in fate, Neo?
1609726 1610811 No.
1611228 1612270 Why not?
1612521 1615316 I don't like the idea that<br />I'm not in control of my life.
1616401 1619737 I know exactly what you mean.
1624033 1626411 Let me tell you why you're here.
1627453 1628996 You know something.
1629539 1631165 What you know,<br />you can't explain.
1631666 1633251 But you feel it.
1633835 1635753 You felt it your entire life:
1636337 1640508 Something's wrong with the world.<br />You don't know what, but it's there.
1641008 1643219 Like a splinter in your mind...
1643469 1645346 driving you mad.
1646264 1649016 It is this feeling<br />that has brought you to me.
1651561 1653396 Do you know what<br />I'm talking about?
1655231 1656566 The Matrix?
1659068 1660736 Do you want to know...
1661195 1663197 what it is?
1665575 1667452 The Matrix is everywhere.
1667702 1669412 It is all around us.
1669662 1671622 Even now, in this very room.
1672457 1674667 You can see it when you<br />look out your window...
1674917 1677253 or when you turn on your television.
1677670 1680214 You can feel it when you go to work...
1681757 1683426 when you go to church...
1683843 1685928 when you pay your taxes.
1687054 1689974 It is the world that has been<br />pulled over your eyes...
1690224 1691809 to blind you from the truth.
1694020 1695271 What truth?
1699525 1701068 That you are a slave.
1702570 1704864 Like everyone else,<br />you were born into bondage...
1705114 1709785 born into a prison that you cannot<br />smell or taste or touch.
1710077 1711370 A prison...
1711621 1712747 for your mind.
1719754 1722089 Unfortunately, no one can be...
1722423 1724801 told what the Matrix is.
1728263 1730140 You have to see it for yourself.
1739650 1741944 This is your last chance.
1742194 1744530 After this, there is no turning back.
1744988 1746448 You take the blue pill...
1746782 1749826 the story ends, you wake up<br />in your bed and believe...
1750077 1751870 whatever you want to believe.
1752120 1753455 You take the red pill...
1753705 1755666 you stay in Wonderland...
1756166 1758877 and I show you how deep<br />the rabbit hole goes.
1768762 1769972 Remember...
1770806 1773850 all I'm offering is the truth.<br />Nothing more.
1788156 1789491 Follow me.
1792035 1793704 Apoc, are we on-line?
1793954 1795330 Almost.
1798667 1800711 Time is always against us.
1801086 1802588 Please take a seat there.
1820772 1822482 - You did all this?<br />- Mm-hm.
1826612 1828614 The pill you took is<br />part of a trace program.
1829364 1833995 It disrupts your carrier signals<br />so we can pinpoint your location.
1834537 1835580 What does that mean?
1836164 1838333 It means buckle your<br />seat belt, Dorothy...
1838666 1840001 because Kansas...
1840251 1841294 is going bye-bye.
1879207 1880583 Did you...?
1891594 1895682 Have you ever had a dream, Neo,<br />that you were so sure was real?
1897141 1899727 What if you were unable<br />to wake from that dream?
1899977 1902480 How would you know the difference<br />between the dream world...
1903106 1904524 and the real world?
1906150 1907318 This can't be.
1907485 1908528 Be what?
1909237 1910738 Be real?
1914701 1916119 - Going into replication.<br />- Apoc?
1916327 1917328 Still nothing.
1917912 1919122 It's cold.
1919372 1920748 It's cold!
1924627 1926295 Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
1927797 1930466 - I got a fibrillation.<br />- Apoc, location.
1930717 1932176 Targeting almost there.
1935471 1936889 He's going into arrest.
1937140 1939643 - Lock. I got him!<br />- Now, Tank, now!
2116905 2117989 Welcome...
2118323 2120241 to the real world.
2121659 2123494 We've done it, Trinity.
2123745 2125288 We found him.
2125538 2128333 - I hope you're right.<br />- I don't have to hope.
2128917 2130501 I know it.
2135673 2136716 Am I dead?
2137216 2139385 Far from it.
2153358 2154777 He still needs a lot of work.
2156320 2157404 What are you doing?
2157655 2159865 Your muscles atrophied.<br />We're rebuilding them.
2160449 2161992 Why do my eyes hurt?
2162701 2164578 You've never used them before.
2168332 2169375 Rest, Neo.
2169625 2171293 The answers are coming.
2245868 2247453 Morpheus, what's happened to me?
2248078 2249163 What is this place?
2249413 2252082 More important than "what" is "when."
2252583 2253625 "When"?
2253834 2255878 You believe it's the year 1999...
2256128 2258380 when in fact, it's closer to 2199.
2259506 2262260 I can't tell you exactly<br />what year it is...
2262510 2264137 because we honestly don't know.
2264637 2267474 There's nothing I can say<br />that will explain it for you.
2267724 2270477 Come with me.<br />See for yourself.
2271019 2272771 This is my ship.
2273063 2275982 The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i><br />It's a hovercraft.
2278818 2280570 This is the main deck.
2286326 2287577 This is the core...
2290080 2293833 where we broadcast our pirate signal<br />and hack into the Matrix.
2297212 2300381 Most of my crew you already know.
2305386 2306805 This is Apoc...
2307597 2308932 Switch...
2310517 2311684 - and Cypher.<br />- Hi.
2311935 2315647 The ones you don't know:<br />Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
2316523 2318942 The little one behind you is Mouse.
2323279 2326533 You wanted to know<br />what the Matrix is?
2327575 2328785 Trinity.
2349806 2351391 Try to relax.
2356271 2358106 This will feel a little weird.
2370077 2371453 This...
2371620 2373330 is the Construct.
2373747 2375875 It's our loading program.
2376125 2378586 We can load anything, from clothing...
2378836 2380212 to equipment...
2380504 2381839 weapons...
2382464 2384300 training simulations...
2384675 2387219 anything we need.
2390014 2392433 Right now we're inside<br />a computer program?
2392725 2394643 Is it really so hard to believe?
2395144 2397771 Your clothes are different.<br />The plugs in your body are gone.
2398981 2401066 Your hair has changed.
2401442 2404778 Your appearance now is what we call<br />"residual self-image."
2405487 2408115 It is the mental projection<br />of your digital self.
2413996 2415122 This isn't real?
2415372 2416916 What is "real"?
2417291 2419543 How do you define "real"?
2419835 2421754 If you're talking about<br />what you can feel...
2422004 2424423 what you can smell, taste and see...
2424673 2428552 then "real" is simply electrical<br />signals interpreted by your brain.
2432723 2435142 This is the world that you know.
2436560 2439605 The world as it was at the end<br />of the 20th century.
2441982 2446320 It exists now only as part of<br />a neural-interactive simulation...
2446570 2447821 that we call the Matrix.
2452368 2455162 You've been living<br />in a dream world, Neo.
2456163 2457289 This is the world...
2457581 2459333 as it exists today.
2472388 2475349 Welcome to "the desert...
2476225 2477811 of the real."
2481189 2483566 We have only bits and pieces<br />of information.
2483817 2487612 But what we know for certain<br />is that in the early 21st century...
2487862 2491116 all of mankind was united<br />in celebration.
2491366 2496121 We marveled at our own magnificence<br />as we gave birth to AI.
2496913 2498039 AI.
2499082 2500458 You mean artificial intelligence.
2500709 2505130 A singular consciousness that spawned<br />an entire race of machines.
2505964 2509426 We don't know who struck first,<br />us or them.
2509843 2513054 But we know that it was us<br />that scorched the sky.
2514723 2516891 They were dependent on solar power...
2517142 2520478 and it was believed that<br />they would be unable to survive...
2520812 2524316 without an energy source<br />as abundant as the sun.
2524566 2529446 Throughout human history, we have<br />been dependent on machines to survive.
2530905 2535118 Fate, it seems, is not<br />without a sense of irony.
2538330 2542751 The human body generates more<br />bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
2543001 2547130 And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
2549049 2551217 Combined with a form of fusion...
2551551 2556389 the machines had found all the energy<br />they would ever need.
2560435 2564189 There are fields, Neo,<br />endless fields...
2564439 2567692 where human beings<br />are no longer born.
2568401 2570236 We are grown.
2576284 2578870 For the longest time,<br />I wouldn't believe it.
2579120 2581790 And then I saw the fields<br />with my own eyes...
2583124 2584752 watched them liquefy the dead...
2585002 2588339 so they could be fed intravenously<br />to the living.
2588881 2593135 And standing there,<br />facing the pure, horrifying precision...
2593386 2596305 I came to realize<br />the obviousness of the truth.
2598933 2600726 What is the Matrix?
2601936 2602978 Control.
2604355 2607733 The Matrix is a computer-generated<br />dream world...
2608526 2611612 built to keep us under control...
2612780 2615950 in order to change a human being...
2616575 2617743 into this.
2619120 2620246 No.
2621872 2623457 I don't believe it.
2623833 2625042 It's not possible.
2625626 2630214 I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.<br />I just said it would be the truth.
2630464 2631757 Stop!
2632299 2633509 Let me out!
2634218 2636137 Let me out! I want out!
2638097 2640766 - Easy, Neo. Easy.<br />- Get this thing out of me.
2641016 2642685 Get this thing out of me!
2644478 2645980 Don't touch me!
2646230 2647857 Stay away from me!
2648274 2649775 I don't believe it.
2650484 2651694 I don't believe it.
2651944 2653446 I don't believe it.
2653696 2655739 - He's gonna pop.<br />- Breathe, Neo.
2656115 2657199 Just breathe.
2675593 2677386 I can't go back, can I?
2678220 2679638 No.
2680473 2681682 But if you could...
2682516 2684018 would you really want to?
2686520 2687897 I owe you an apology.
2688481 2689857 We have a rule.
2690316 2693570 We never free a mind<br />once it's reached a certain age.
2693737 2694821 It's dangerous.
2695530 2697240 The mind has trouble letting go.
2697491 2699784 I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
2700827 2702913 I did what I did because...
2703622 2705081 I had to.
2713507 2717594 When the Matrix was first built,<br />there was a man born inside...
2718094 2721890 who had the ability<br />to change whatever he wanted...
2722265 2725185 to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
2726937 2730398 It was he who freed the first of us...
2731274 2732901 taught us the truth.
2734361 2737447 As long as the Matrix exists...
2737781 2739866 the human race will never be free.
2744079 2745622 After he died...
2746373 2749084 the Oracle prophesied his return...
2749626 2752837 and that his coming would hail<br />the destruction of the Matrix...
2753088 2754756 end the war...
2755090 2756341 bring freedom to our people.
2757676 2762305 That is why there are those of us who<br />spent our lives searching the Matrix...
2762639 2764224 looking for him.
2766643 2768728 I did what I did because...
2770355 2772482 I believe that search is over.
2777571 2778989 Get some rest.
2779614 2781408 You're going to need it.
2784119 2785161 For what?
2788206 2789416 Your training.
2807727 2809437 Morning. Did you sleep?
2810313 2811522 You will tonight.
2811897 2813441 I guarantee it.
2814942 2816861 I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
2817320 2819739 - You don't have any...<br />- Holes? Nope.
2820656 2825369 Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%<br />pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
2825620 2826829 Born free right here...
2827371 2828706 in the real world.
2828956 2830625 Genuine child of Zion.
2831459 2833919 - Zion?<br />- If the war was over tomorrow...
2834170 2835671 Zion's where the party would be.
2836088 2837381 It's a city?
2837632 2840801 The last human city.<br />The only place we have left.
2842386 2843638 Where is it?
2845389 2848809 Deep underground near the Earth's core,<br />where it's still warm.
2850436 2852313 You live long enough,<br />you might see it.
2854565 2859403 Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited<br />to see what you're capable of...
2859654 2861405 if Morpheus is right and all.
2861906 2864659 We're not supposed to<br />talk about this, but...
2864909 2866327 if you are...
2867411 2869413 it's a very exciting time.
2870456 2873167 We got a lot to do.<br />We gotta get to it.
2877088 2880007 We're supposed to start<br />with these programs first.
2881008 2884470 That's major boring shit.<br />Let's do something more fun.
2884804 2886263 How about...
2887848 2889600 combat training?
2895648 2897108 "Jujitsu"?
2897983 2899652 I'm going to learn jujitsu?
2910997 2912207 Holy shit!
2912457 2914793 "Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
2915127 2916420 How about some more?
2916670 2917963 Hell, yes.
2920048 2921091 Hell, yeah.
2933270 2934354 How is he?
2934604 2936773 Ten hours straight.<br />He's a machine.
2947993 2949369 I know kung fu.
2951037 2952038 Show me.
2953832 2955584 This is a sparring program...
2955834 2958628 similar to the programmed reality<br />of the Matrix.
2958879 2961214 It has the same basic rules.<br />Like gravity.
2961465 2964926 These rules are no different<br />than those of a computer system.
2965469 2966970 Some of them can be bent.
2967179 2969639 Others can be broken.
2970182 2971266 Understand?
2972350 2973393 Then hit me...
2973977 2975103 if you can.
3014100 3015143 Good!
3015895 3017063 Adaptation.
3017355 3018564 Improvisation.
3018856 3020191 But your weakness...
3020441 3021818 is not your technique.
3028783 3030868 Morpheus is fighting Neo.
3103149 3104317 How did I beat you?
3110907 3111991 You're too fast.
3112533 3113868 Do you believe that...
3114243 3116746 my being stronger or faster...
3116996 3120666 has anything to do<br />with my muscles in this place?
3124713 3126506 You think you're breathing air?
3140020 3141229 Again!
3152699 3155118 Jesus Christ, he's fast!
3155369 3157579 His neuro-kinetics<br />are way above normal.
3163043 3164503 What are you waiting for?
3164753 3166713 You're faster than this.
3168924 3171134 Don't think you are.
3171385 3173053 Know you are.
3183438 3186233 Come on! Stop trying to hit me,<br />and hit me!
3196159 3197911 I don't believe it.
3199454 3201581 I know what you're trying to do.
3203250 3205419 I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
3205752 3207838 But I can only show you the door.
3208422 3210257 You have to walk through it.
3212634 3214761 Tank, load the jump program.
3226356 3229067 You have to let it all go, Neo.<br />Fear...
3229609 3231779 doubt and disbelief.
3232947 3235658 Free your mind.
3243916 3245043 Whoa.
3251841 3253551 Okey-dokey.
3255636 3256804 Free my mind.
3257263 3258389 What if he makes it?
3258639 3261350 - No one's ever made their first jump.<br />- I know.
3262685 3265146 - But what if he does?<br />- He won't.
3265730 3266814 Come on.
3267065 3268232 All right.
3268691 3270735 No problem. Free my mind.
3271527 3274322 Free my mind. No problem. Right.
3293716 3295384 What does that mean?
3295760 3297595 It doesn't mean anything.
3298179 3300765 Everybody falls the first time.
3301224 3302517 Right, Trin?
3323204 3325832 - I thought it wasn't real.<br />- Your mind makes it real.
3329085 3331337 If you're killed in the Matrix...
3331504 3332547 you die here?
3333172 3335633 The body cannot live without the mind.
3366123 3369501 I don't remember you ever<br />bringing me dinner.
3372588 3375424 There is something about him,<br />isn't there?
3376049 3377676 You're a believer now?
3378677 3379887 I keep wondering...
3380137 3383807 if Morpheus is so sure,<br />why not take him to see the Oracle?
3384725 3387644 Morpheus will take him<br />when he's ready.
3397446 3398989 The Matrix is a system, Neo.
3400741 3402034 That system is our enemy.
3402659 3404995 But when you're inside,<br />what do you see?
3405245 3409041 Businessmen, teachers,<br />lawyers, carpenters.
3409499 3412085 The very minds of the people<br />we are trying to save.
3412336 3415297 But until we do, these people are<br />a part of that system...
3415547 3417466 and that makes them our enemy.
3417633 3418842 You have to understand...
3419092 3422429 most of these people are not<br />ready to be unplugged.
3422679 3424264 And many of them are so inert...
3424514 3426934 so hopelessly dependent<br />on the system...
3427184 3429895 that they will fight to protect it.
3431396 3435150 Were you listening to me or looking<br />at the woman in the red dress?
3435317 3437069 - I was...<br />- Look again.
3438320 3439404 Freeze it.
3446036 3447664 - This isn't the Matrix?<br />- No.
3449457 3453294 It's another training program<br />designed to teach you one thing:
3453920 3456339 If you are not one of us,<br />you are one of them.
3456881 3459676 - What are they?<br />- Sentient programs.
3460426 3464722 They can move in and out of any<br />software still hardwired to their system.
3465098 3468476 That means that anyone<br />we haven't unplugged...
3468810 3470144 is potentially an agent.
3471104 3472939 Inside the Matrix...
3473523 3475233 they are everyone...
3475566 3477277 and they are no one.
3477527 3480655 We have survived by hiding<br />and running from them...
3480905 3482532 but they are the gatekeepers.
3482782 3485743 They're guarding all the doors<br />and holding all the keys.
3485994 3488830 Sooner or later, someone will<br />have to fight them.
3488997 3490206 Someone?
3490540 3491958 I won't lie to you, Neo.
3492417 3497255 Every single man or woman who<br />has fought an agent, has died.
3497505 3499882 But where they have failed,<br />you will succeed.
3500049 3501134 Why?
3501384 3503678 I've seen an agent punch<br />through a concrete wall.
3503928 3507515 Men have emptied entire clips at them<br />and hit nothing but air.
3507765 3512395 Yet their strength and speed are still<br />based in a world built on rules.
3512645 3513771 Because of that...
3514022 3517400 they will never be as strong<br />or as fast as you can be.
3521696 3523573 What are you telling me?
3524282 3525742 That I can dodge bullets?
3527744 3529120 No, Neo.
3529620 3532540 I'm trying to tell you<br />that when you're ready...
3533416 3534751 you won't have to.
3538880 3540089 <i>We got trouble.</i>
3559026 3561487 - Did Zion send the warning?<br />- No, another ship.
3564740 3566033 Shit.
3566283 3569161 - Squiddy's sweeping in quick.<br />- Squiddy?
3569370 3572581 A sentinel. A killing machine<br />designed for one thing.
3572831 3574041 Search and destroy.
3575376 3576543 Set her down there.
3597815 3599316 How are we doing, Tank?
3608033 3609201 Power off-line.
3609701 3611662 EMP armed...
3612204 3613747 - and ready.<br />- EMP?
3614039 3615916 Electromagnetic pulse.
3616166 3619044 Disables any electrical system<br />in the blast radius.
3619211 3621505 It's the only weapon we have<br />against the machines.
3627302 3630431 - Where are we?<br />- Their old service and waste systems.
3631682 3632808 Sewers.
3633016 3635727 There used to be cities<br />that spanned hundreds of miles.
3636228 3638147 Now these sewers are<br />all that's left.
3638397 3639731 Quiet.
3680315 3681774 Whoa! Neo.
3683610 3685778 You scared the bejesus out of me.
3686863 3688781 - Sorry.<br />- It's okay.
3691284 3692535 Is that...?
3692785 3694370 The Matrix?
3694537 3695747 Yeah.
3697540 3700710 - Do you always look at it encoded?<br />- Well, you have to.
3700960 3704047 The image translators work<br />for the construct program.
3704297 3707717 But there's way too much information<br />to decode the Matrix.
3707967 3710929 You get used to it.<br />I don't even see the code.
3711179 3714599 All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
3715767 3717143 Do you...
3717435 3718520 want a drink?
3718770 3719812 Sure.
3723358 3724817 You know...
3725735 3727278 I know what you're thinking.
3727529 3729614 Because right now I'm thinking<br />the same thing.
3729948 3733284 Actually, I've been thinking it<br />ever since I got here.
3735203 3738206 Why, oh, why didn't I take<br />the blue pill?
3750593 3752512 Good shit, huh?
3752845 3754055 Dozer makes it.
3754514 3755682 It's good for two things:
3755932 3759018 Degreasing engines and<br />killing brain cells.
3760019 3762230 So can I ask you something?
3765233 3766859 Did he tell you why he did it?
3769488 3771323 Why you're here?
3774994 3776745 Jesus!
3777955 3779873 What a mind job.
3781292 3784086 So you're here to save the world.
3785588 3787673 What do you say<br />to something like that?
3792845 3794221 A little piece of advice.
3796015 3797433 You see an agent...
3797766 3800060 you do what we do:
3800394 3801937 Run.
3802271 3804023 You run your ass off.
3811280 3812990 Thanks for the drink.
3817703 3818871 Sweet dreams.
3822875 3826295 Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
3826962 3828088 You know...
3829506 3831967 I know this steak doesn't exist.
3832968 3835721 I know that when I put it<br />in my mouth...
3835971 3839058 the Matrix is telling my brain<br />that it is...
3839350 3840476 juicy...
3840768 3842478 and delicious.
3845397 3846649 After nine years...
3847691 3849234 you know what I realize?
3857076 3858285 Ignorance is bliss.
3863332 3865167 Then we have a deal.
3867670 3869588 I don't want to remember nothing.
3869838 3872341 Nothing. You understand?
3876220 3878223 And I want to be rich.
3879557 3882268 You know, someone important.
3883770 3884896 Like an actor.
3886106 3889234 Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
3891403 3892946 Okay.
3893321 3895740 You get my body<br />back in a power plant...
3896116 3897867 reinsert me into the Matrix...
3898201 3899619 I'll get you what you want.
3899869 3901871 Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
3902122 3904290 No. I told you, I don't know them.
3907252 3909254 I can get you the man who does.
3910004 3911798 Morpheus.
3921891 3925353 Here you go, buddy.<br />Breakfast of champions.
3926688 3929482 Close your eyes, it feels<br />like you're eating runny eggs.
3929691 3931401 Or a bowl of snot.
3931943 3933528 You know what it reminds me of?
3935363 3937699 Tastee Wheat. Did you<br />ever eat Tastee Wheat?
3938324 3940034 No, but technically,<br />neither did you.
3940285 3942328 That's exactly my point. Exactly.
3942579 3943955 Because you have to wonder...
3944205 3947459 how do the machines really know<br />what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
3947709 3949127 Maybe they got it wrong.
3949377 3952589 Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat<br />tasted like, actually tasted like...
3952881 3954883 oatmeal or tuna fish.
3955258 3958094 That makes you wonder.<br />Take chicken, for example.
3958344 3960384 Maybe they didn't know<br />what to make it taste like...
3960597 3962640 which is why it tastes<br />like everything.
3962891 3964684 - And maybe they...<br />- Shut up.
3966311 3967771 It's a single-celled protein...
3968021 3971065 combined with synthetic aminos,<br />vitamins and minerals.
3971316 3972567 Everything the body needs.
3972817 3975695 It doesn't have everything<br />the body needs.
3978448 3981534 I understand you've run through<br />the agent training program.
3982577 3984621 You know, I wrote that program.
3984914 3986207 Here it comes.
3986457 3988417 - What did you think of her?<br />- Of who?
3988793 3991837 The woman in the red dress.<br />I designed her.
3992171 3994924 She doesn't talk very much...
3995174 3999136 but if you'd like to meet her,<br />I can arrange a more personal milieu.
3999386 4000763 The digital pimp hard at work.
4001013 4003265 Pay no attention to<br />these hypocrites, Neo.
4004558 4006393 To deny our own impulses...
4006644 4009772 is to deny the very thing<br />that makes us human.
4011690 4013067 Dozer, when you're done...
4013275 4014875 bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
4015444 4016779 We're going in.
4017488 4018906 I'm taking Neo to see her.
4022827 4024078 See who?
4025079 4026330 The Oracle.
4031836 4033379 Everyone please observe...
4033712 4036423 the "fasten seat belt"<br />and "no smoking" signs are on.
4036924 4040302 Sit back and enjoy your flight.
4064743 4065744 We're in.
4081385 4082553 We'll be back in an hour.
4097319 4099321 Unbelievable...
4099571 4100906 isn't it?
4104492 4106328 - God!<br />- What?
4106995 4108371 I used to eat there.
4110624 4112250 Really good noodles.
4117047 4119549 I have these memories from my life.
4122010 4123678 None of them happened.
4124387 4125639 What does that mean?
4125889 4128099 That the Matrix cannot tell you<br />who you are.
4129017 4130226 But an oracle can?
4130685 4131895 That's different.
4136608 4137859 Did you go to her?
4139402 4140570 Yes.
4141071 4142447 What did she tell you?
4145700 4147202 She told me...
4148244 4149412 What?
4153208 4154542 We're here.
4154918 4157212 Neo, come with me.
4177190 4179609 So is this the same oracle<br />that made...
4179776 4181027 the prophecy?
4181277 4185615 Yes. She's very old. She's been<br />with us since the beginning.
4186074 4188076 - The beginning?<br />- Of the Resistance.
4190328 4192706 And she knows what? Everything?
4194749 4196668 She would say she knows enough.
4197794 4199587 And she's never wrong.
4201799 4204969 Try not to think of it<br />in terms of right and wrong.
4205302 4206887 She is a guide, Neo.
4207263 4209140 She can help you to find the path.
4209640 4210891 She helped you?
4211600 4212643 Yes.
4213394 4214729 What did she tell you?
4217189 4219400 That I would find the One.
4232538 4234665 I told you I can only<br />show you the door.
4235374 4237460 You have to walk through it.
4241255 4242339 Hello, Neo.
4242590 4244258 You're right on time.
4252183 4255978 Make yourself at home, Morpheus.<br />Neo, come with me.
4261650 4263235 These are the other Potentials.
4263486 4265029 You can wait here.
4305861 4308406 Do not try and bend the spoon.
4308782 4310909 That's impossible.
4311743 4315747 Instead, only try<br />to realize the truth.
4316289 4317666 What truth?
4317916 4319584 There is no spoon.
4322170 4323505 There is no spoon?
4323755 4328218 Then you'll see that it is not the spoon<br />that bends. It is only yourself.
4344276 4345735 The Oracle will you see now.
4356454 4357998 I know you're Neo.
4358623 4359791 Be right with you.
4360834 4363211 - You're the Oracle?<br />- Bingo.
4365922 4368800 Not quite what you<br />were expecting, right?
4369843 4372012 Almost done.
4374514 4376141 Smell good, don't they?
4377392 4378643 Yeah.
4378894 4380729 I'd ask you to sit down...
4380979 4383356 but you're not going to anyway.
4383857 4386735 - And don't worry about the vase.<br />- What vase?
4389863 4391031 That vase.
4391990 4393033 I'm sorry.
4393283 4395160 I said, don't worry about it.
4396328 4398288 I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
4398914 4400123 How did you know?
4402167 4405962 What's really going to bake<br />your noodle later on is...
4406296 4409257 would you still have broken it<br />if I hadn't said anything?
4414054 4415973 You're cuter than I thought.
4419018 4421270 I can see why she likes you.
4422146 4423231 Who?
4423481 4425316 Not too bright, though.
4428611 4431697 You know why Morpheus<br />brought you to see me.
4433824 4434992 So...
4435952 4437328 what do you think?
4439163 4440915 Do you think you are the One?
4442875 4443918 I don't know.
4447338 4448756 You know what that means?
4449590 4450758 It's Latin.
4451133 4453344 Means, "Know thyself."
4454804 4456764 I'll let you in on a little secret.
4459016 4462853 Being the One is just<br />like being in love.
4463562 4466440 No one can tell you you're in love.<br />You just know it...
4466691 4467817 through and through.
4468150 4470194 Balls to bones.
4472530 4473572 Well...
4475533 4477618 I'd better have a look at you.
4478953 4480454 Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
4494844 4496512 Okay...
4497138 4502101 Now I'm supposed to say,<br />"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."
4502601 4503728 Then you say:
4504395 4505604 But what?
4505855 4509817 But you already know<br />what I'm going to tell you.
4511235 4514196 - I'm not the One.<br />- Sorry, kid.
4515823 4517825 You got the gift...
4518743 4521037 but it looks like<br />you're waiting for something.
4525709 4526752 What?
4527002 4529880 Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
4530464 4532716 That's the way these things go.
4533592 4536178 - What's funny?<br />- Morpheus.
4539639 4541350 He almost had me convinced.
4541600 4542726 I know.
4544269 4546396 Poor Morpheus.
4548774 4551902 Without him, we're lost.
4553445 4555614 What do you mean, "without him"?
4559618 4561536 Are you sure you want<br />to hear this?
4563747 4566500 Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
4568210 4570379 And no one, not you, not even me...
4570629 4572881 can convince him otherwise.
4573256 4575634 He believes it so blindly...
4575926 4580263 that he's going to sacrifice<br />his life to save yours.
4580472 4581640 What?
4581807 4584476 You're going to<br />have to make a choice.
4585102 4588688 In the one hand,<br />you'll have Morpheus' life.
4589189 4592067 And in the other hand,<br />you'll have your own.
4593485 4595779 One of you is going to die.
4597864 4601159 Which one will be up to you.
4602536 4604454 I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
4604704 4606373 You have a good soul.
4607457 4610168 And I hate giving<br />good people bad news.
4613296 4614756 Don't worry about it.
4615006 4617426 As soon as you<br />step outside that door...
4617676 4619803 you'll start feeling better.
4620512 4624307 You'll remember you don't believe<br />in any of this fate crap.
4625142 4627894 You're in control of your own life.
4628728 4630021 Remember?
4631691 4632900 Here...
4634777 4636320 take a cookie.
4636863 4640199 I promise, by the time<br />you're done eating it...
4641159 4643536 you'll feel right as rain.
4652753 4654088 What was said...
4654714 4656174 was for you...
4656716 4658551 and for you alone.
4681491 4682575 They're on the way.
4712396 4713439 What is that?
4728204 4729622 Oh, déjà vu.
4733125 4734210 What did you just say?
4734460 4735962 Nothing.<br />Just déjà vu.
4736212 4737838 - What did you see?<br />- What happened?
4739258 4741426 A black cat went past us...
4741677 4743303 then another just like it.
4743554 4745097 Was it the same cat?
4746056 4748892 - I'm not sure.<br />- Switch, Apoc.
4752980 4754189 What is it?
4754439 4758860 A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the<br />Matrix when they change something.
4761822 4763073 Oh, my God.
4764866 4765867 Let's go.
4771123 4772916 They cut the hard line.<br />It's a trap! Get out!
4778380 4779631 Oh, no.
4819921 4822382 That's what they changed.<br />We're trapped.
4822633 4824509 Be calm. Give me your phone.
4824760 4826303 They'll be able to track it.
4826553 4827971 We have no choice.
4829389 4830599 Operator.
4830932 4833769 <i>Find a structural drawing of<br />this building. Find it fast.</i>
4841610 4844196 - Got it!<br /><i>- I need the main wet-wall.</i>
4847033 4848284 Eighth floor.
4848493 4850078 <i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>
4850370 4851829 Switch, straight ahead.
4852580 4853748 Neo...
4859879 4862006 I hope the Oracle<br />gave you some good news.
4870306 4871808 <i>Now left. That's it.</i>
4872100 4873142 Good.
4882860 4884153 Where are they?
4944589 4945757 They're in the walls.
4947216 4948384 In the walls!
4969782 4971450 It's an agent!
4978749 4980083 Morpheus!
4980250 4981502 You must get Neo out!
4981752 4983587 He's all that matters!
4983879 4986089 - No, Morpheus! Don't!<br />- Trinity, go!
4987049 4988383 Go!
4994640 4996558 - We can't leave him!<br />- We have to!
5020874 5022668 Cypher, come on!
5027589 5031426 The great Morpheus.<br />We meet at last.
5031969 5033095 And you are?
5033345 5035097 A Smith.
5035347 5036640 Agent Smith.
5037224 5039268 You all look the same to me.
5094908 5096200 Take him.
5102832 5104292 No!
5109422 5111257 - Operator.<br /><i>- I need an exit, fast.</i>
5113343 5116262 There was an accident.<br />Goddamn car accident.
5116596 5118389 <i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>
5118640 5120016 Somebody up there still likes me.
5120266 5121517 I got you.
5122018 5123937 <i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>
5124187 5126856 Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.<br />An old TV repair shop.
5127106 5128149 Right.
5131277 5132862 - Operator.<br /><i>- Tank, it's me.</i>
5133112 5134280 Is Morpheus alive?
5134656 5135949 Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
5136366 5138284 <i>Yes. They're moving him.<br />I don't know where.</i>
5138493 5140787 He's alive. We need an exit.
5141037 5142121 You're not far from Cypher.
5142288 5143539 <i>- Cypher?</i><br />- I know.
5143790 5145875 <i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i><br />- Got it.
5154968 5156177 Got him.
5167105 5168147 Where are they?
5168398 5169650 Making the call.
5170317 5171485 Good.
5184623 5185874 You first.
5189086 5190295 Shit!
5193590 5195259 Tank!
5195426 5197052 No!
5198971 5201140 I don't know. It just went dead.
5227958 5229168 <i>Hello, Trinity.</i>
5229585 5230919 Cypher? Where's Tank?
5236508 5237551 You know...
5239261 5241388 for a long time...
5242598 5245476 I thought I was in love with you.
5246268 5248312 <i>I used to dream about you.</i>
5249396 5252107 You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
5252357 5254735 <i>Too bad things had to<br />turn out this way.</i>
5255277 5256320 You killed them.
5256820 5258322 - What?<br />- Oh, God.
5258572 5259990 I'm tired, Trinity.
5261408 5263285 I'm tired of this war...
5263577 5266413 tired of fighting.<br />I'm tired of this ship...
5266747 5271376 of being cold, of eating<br />the same goddamn goop every day.
5273587 5274713 But most of all...
5275297 5278676 <i>I'm tired of that jackoff<br />and all of his bullshit.</i>
5279803 5281096 Surprise, asshole!
5281638 5283848 I bet you never saw this coming...
5284099 5285141 did you?
5287435 5289813 God, I wish I could be there...
5290396 5291898 when they break you.
5292941 5296111 I wish I could walk in<br />just when it happens...
5296820 5298530 so right then...
5298780 5300115 you'd know it was me.
5300615 5301783 You gave them Morpheus.
5302033 5303493 <i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>
5304077 5305578 He tricked us!
5306121 5308123 If you had told us the truth...
5308373 5311251 we would've told you to shove<br />that red pill up your ass!
5311501 5313628 That is not true, Cypher.<br />He set us free.
5313878 5316756 "Free." You call this free?
5319175 5321678 All I do is what he tells me to do.
5323263 5326182 If I had to choose between<br />that and the Matrix...
5327350 5328560 I choose the Matrix.
5328810 5330478 The Matrix isn't real.
5330728 5332147 <i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>
5332397 5334649 I think the Matrix...
5334983 5337569 can be more real than this world.
5339737 5342240 All I do is pull the plug here.
5342615 5343825 But there...
5344367 5346661 <i>you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
5347662 5348913 Trinity.
5354419 5357380 <i>- Welcome to the real world.</i><br />- But you're out, Cypher.
5357630 5360049 <i>- You can't go back.</i><br />- That's what you think.
5360300 5361801 <i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>
5362051 5365680 <i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,<br />I won't remember a thing.</i>
5365889 5366931 By the way...
5367182 5370143 if you have anything important<br />to say to Switch...
5370643 5371728 <i>say it now.</i>
5371978 5375023 - No, please don't.<br />- Not like this.
5376733 5378359 Not like this.
5382822 5383865 Too late.
5384616 5385910 Goddamn you, Cypher!
5386160 5388037 Don't hate me, Trinity.
5388412 5390289 I'm just a messenger.
5390706 5393876 And right now,<br />I'm going to prove it to you.
5394960 5396629 If Morpheus was right...
5397171 5399048 there's no way<br />I can pull this plug.
5399632 5401133 <i>If Neo's the One...</i>
5401634 5403469 <i>then there'd have to be...</i>
5403719 5406305 some kind of a miracle to stop me.
5406472 5407681 Right?
5408307 5410392 I mean, how can he be the One...
5410559 5411644 if he's dead?
5413020 5415272 <i>You never did answer me before...</i>
5415564 5417900 <i>if you bought into<br />Morpheus' bullshit.</i>
5418275 5421487 Come on. All I want<br />is a little yes or no.
5422863 5425199 Look into his eyes...
5425950 5427451 <i>those big, pretty eyes...</i>
5430204 5431538 and tell me...
5432248 5433499 <i>yes...</i>
5433832 5435209 <i>or no.</i>
5436502 5438045 - Yes.<br /><i>- No!</i>
5438212 5439380 I don't believe it.
5440798 5445552 Believe it or not, you piece of shit,<br />you're still going to burn!
5463821 5465197 You first.
5473414 5475708 - You're hurt.<br />- I'll be all right.
5478502 5479670 Dozer?
5497939 5500317 Have you ever stood and stared at it?
5501192 5504321 Marveled at its beauty...
5504696 5506948 its genius?
5508116 5509993 Billions of people...
5510243 5512996 just living out their lives.
5514039 5515707 Oblivious.
5520295 5523173 Did you know that the first Matrix...
5523423 5528094 was designed to be a perfect<br />human world where none suffered...
5528595 5531514 where everyone would be happy.
5532057 5533558 It was a disaster.
5533808 5538146 No one would accept the program.<br />Entire crops were lost.
5539022 5540774 Some believe that...
5541024 5545403 we lacked the programming language<br />to describe your perfect world.
5545653 5547197 But I believe that...
5547364 5548531 as a species...
5548782 5552619 human beings define<br />their reality through misery...
5552869 5554245 and suffering.
5554496 5557207 So the perfect world was a dream...
5557457 5562295 that your primitive cerebrum<br />kept trying to wake up from.
5563630 5567300 Which is why the Matrix was<br />redesigned to this.
5567759 5569260 The peak...
5569511 5570929 of your civilization.
5571179 5573431 I say, "your civilization"...
5573681 5577811 because when we started thinking<br />for you, it became our civilization...
5578061 5581147 which is, of course,<br />what this is all about.
5582482 5585068 Evolution, Morpheus.
5585360 5586694 Evolution.
5588988 5590865 Like the dinosaur.
5593034 5594661 Look out that window.
5595370 5597497 You had your time.
5598206 5602128 The future is our world, Morpheus.
5602461 5604839 The future is our time.
5609093 5610261 There could be a problem.
5611178 5614557 - What are they doing to him?<br />- They're breaking into his mind.
5614807 5616976 It's like hacking a computer.<br />All it takes is time.
5617226 5618436 How much time?
5618686 5621814 Depends on the mind.<br />But eventually, it'll crack...
5622064 5626485 and his alpha patterns<br />will change from this to this.
5626735 5629697 When it does, he'll tell them<br />anything they want to know.
5629947 5630990 What do they want?
5631240 5635286 The leader of every ship is given<br />codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
5635536 5638456 If an agent got the codes<br />and got into Zion's mainframe...
5638706 5641792 they could destroy us.<br />We can't let that happen.
5641959 5644211 Trinity, Zion's more important than me...
5644378 5645546 or you...
5645713 5647006 or even Morpheus.
5650801 5652470 There has to be<br />something we can do.
5652887 5654889 There is. We pull the plug.
5657975 5659727 You're going to kill him?
5659977 5661145 Kill Morpheus?
5661770 5663397 We don't have a choice.
5670196 5673115 Never send a human<br />to do a machine's job.
5673365 5675117 If the insider has failed...
5675367 5678579 they'll sever the connection<br />as soon as possible, unless...
5678829 5680539 They're dead. In either case...
5680789 5684335 We have no choice. Continue as planned.<br />Deploy the sentinels.
5684585 5685669 Immediately.
5690925 5693594 Morpheus, you were more<br />than a leader to us.
5694553 5696764 You were a father.
5698307 5700267 We'll miss you always.
5707149 5708360 Stop!
5709528 5710888 I don't believe this is happening.
5711029 5713073 - Neo, this has to be done.<br />- Does it?
5713865 5715242 I don't know.
5715575 5718036 - This can't be just coincidence.<br />- What?
5718245 5719496 The Oracle.
5719746 5721540 She told me this would happen.
5721957 5726127 She told me that I would<br />have to make a choice.
5726586 5727796 What choice?
5730799 5733301 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm going in.
5733635 5735971 - No, you're not.<br />- I have to.
5736179 5739808 Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself<br />so that we could get you out.
5740058 5741977 There is no way<br />that you're going back in.
5742561 5745814 Morpheus did what he did because<br />he believed I'm something I'm not.
5747315 5748358 What?
5749067 5750694 I'm not the One, Trinity.
5751069 5754030 - The Oracle hit me with that too.<br />- No, you have to be.
5754281 5756950 I'm sorry, I'm not.<br />I'm just another guy.
5757617 5758868 No, Neo, that's not true.
5759452 5762080 - It can't be true.<br />- Why?
5766501 5769838 This is loco. They've got Morpheus<br />in a military-controlled building.
5770088 5774467 Even if you somehow got inside, those<br />are agents holding him. Three of them.
5775760 5779681 I want Morpheus back too, but<br />what you're talking about is suicide.
5779931 5781516 That's what it looks like...
5781683 5782726 but it's not.
5782976 5785353 I can't explain to you why it's not.
5786438 5790150 Morpheus believed something, and<br />he was ready to give his life for it.
5790400 5793403 I understand that now.<br />That's why I have to go.
5793695 5796197 - Why?<br />- Because I believe in something.
5796364 5797991 What?
5798700 5800410 I believe I can bring him back.
5817386 5819305 - What are you doing?<br />- Going with you.
5819597 5821599 - No, you're not.<br />- "No"?
5822767 5824894 Let me tell you what I believe.
5825394 5827772 Morpheus means more to me<br />than he does to you.
5828105 5832401 I believe if you are serious about<br />saving him, you will need my help.
5832652 5834695 And since I am the ranking officer...
5834945 5837823 if you don't like it,<br />I believe you can go to hell.
5838574 5840993 Because you aren't going anywhere else.
5841410 5842953 Tank...
5843120 5844246 load us up.
5853881 5857176 I'd like to share<br />a revelation that I've had...
5857593 5859136 during my time here.
5859387 5863391 It came to me when I tried<br />to classify your species...
5863641 5865893 and I realized...
5866143 5868437 that you're not actually mammals.
5870648 5873109 Every mammal on this planet...
5873442 5878364 instinctively develops an equilibrium<br />with the surrounding environment.
5878614 5880449 But you humans do not.
5880991 5884537 You move to an area<br />and you multiply...
5884787 5889291 and multiply until every<br />natural resource is consumed.
5889625 5891711 The only way you can survive...
5892002 5894964 is to spread to another area.
5900386 5903264 There is another organism<br />on this planet...
5903514 5905474 that follows the same pattern.
5906100 5907768 Do you know what it is?
5908144 5909979 A virus.
5911313 5914358 Human beings are a disease.
5914734 5916277 A cancer of this planet.
5916527 5918654 You are a plague.
5919196 5920614 And we...
5920781 5922158 are the cure.
5923159 5924578 Okay, so what do you need?
5925203 5926329 Besides a miracle.
5926913 5928123 Guns.
5928957 5930167 Lots of guns.
5940051 5941261 Neo...
5943013 5945557 No one has ever done<br />anything like this.
5946767 5948685 That's why it's going to work.
5952773 5954691 Why isn't the serum working?
5955317 5957611 Perhaps we're asking<br />the wrong questions.
5959696 5960947 Leave me with him.
5963533 5964659 Now.
5975879 5977464 Hold on, Morpheus.
5977714 5980425 They're coming for you.<br />They're coming.
5982803 5984930 Can you hear me, Morpheus?
5985180 5987849 I'm going to be honest...
5988225 5989434 with you.
5993814 5995232 I...
5996107 5997234 hate...
5997484 5999444 this place...
5999778 6002072 this zoo...
6002322 6003448 this prison...
6003698 6006868 this reality,<br />whatever you want to call it.
6007118 6009412 I can't stand it any longer.
6010163 6012040 It's the smell.
6013416 6015293 If there is such a thing.
6015627 6018922 I feel saturated by it.
6020423 6021716 I can...
6021967 6023510 taste...
6023677 6025720 your stink.
6025971 6029599 And every time I do, I fear that<br />I have somehow been infected by it.
6029766 6030767 It's repulsive.
6031769 6033145 Isn't it?
6035314 6037608 I must get out of here.
6038025 6040236 I must get free.
6040486 6043364 And in this mind is the key.
6043614 6045283 My key.
6045533 6048411 Once Zion is destroyed,<br />there is no need for me to be here.
6048661 6050288 Do you understand?
6050580 6051956 I need the codes.
6052206 6054542 I have to get inside Zion...
6054876 6057378 and you have to tell me how.
6057795 6059672 You're going to tell me...
6059922 6062091 or you're going to die.
6082278 6085406 Please remove any metallic items<br />you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
6089327 6090369 Holy shit!
6102465 6105176 Backup. Send backup.
6128991 6130117 Freeze!
6264962 6266172 What were you doing?
6268007 6269300 He doesn't know.
6269550 6271052 Know what?
6299122 6301624 I think they're trying to save him.
6316472 6318224 There is no spoon.
6347837 6350006 Find them and destroy them!
6351632 6353467 We're under attack!
6385584 6386752 Trinity!
6387252 6388337 Help!
6410359 6411568 Only human.
6412527 6413612 Dodge this.
6426833 6428335 - How did you do that?<br />- Do what?
6428752 6432673 You moved like they do.<br />I've never seen anyone move that fast.
6433799 6435175 It wasn't fast enough.
6437928 6439221 Can you fly that thing?
6440347 6441348 Not yet.
6444643 6445686 Operator.
6445894 6449064 <i>I need a pilot program<br />for a B-212 helicopter.</i>
6449523 6450816 <i>Hurry.</i>
6458740 6460367 Let's go.
6475466 6476551 No.
6528144 6530772 Morpheus, get up.<br />Get up, get up.
6568810 6569852 He's not going to make it.
6579655 6580697 Got you.
6646763 6647931 Trinity!
6689599 6691017 I knew it.
6691643 6692852 He's the One.
6708826 6711037 Do you believe it now, Trinity?
6713915 6715083 Morpheus...
6716751 6717835 The Oracle.
6719087 6721464 - She told me...<br />- She told you...
6721839 6723424 what you needed to hear.
6723716 6725051 That's all.
6726094 6729055 Sooner or later you'll realize,<br />just as I did...
6729389 6731683 there's a difference<br />between knowing the path...
6732433 6733726 and walking the path.
6736771 6737981 - Operator.<br /><i>- Tank.</i>
6738898 6741442 - It's good to hear your voice.<br /><i>- We need an exit.</i>
6741693 6744487 Got one ready. Subway station,<br />State and Balboa.
6757542 6759961 - Damn it!<br />- The trace was completed.
6760211 6763798 - We have their position.<br />- Sentinels are standing by.
6765508 6767010 Order the strike.
6773558 6775560 They're not out yet.
6786739 6788073 You first, Morpheus.
6808761 6811055 Neo, I want to tell you something...
6814308 6818270 but I'm afraid of<br />what it could mean if I do.
6821857 6825152 Everything the Oracle<br />told me has come true.
6827905 6829448 Everything but this.
6830949 6831992 But what?
6856892 6858060 Neo!
6858310 6859937 - What happened?<br />- An agent.
6860187 6862106 - Send me back.<br />- I can't.
6864149 6866110 Mr. Anderson.
6868320 6869697 Run, Neo. Run.
6874993 6876620 What is he doing?
6876870 6878122 He's beginning to believe.
6905108 6906484 You're empty.
6907068 6908361 So are you.
6941519 6944522 I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
6945648 6946691 Mr. Anderson.
6987649 6989734 Jesus, he's killing him.
7075905 7078032 You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
7078782 7081785 That is the sound of inevitability.
7084371 7087708 It is the sound of your death.
7088626 7090961 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7091211 7092838 My name...
7095841 7097885 is Neo.
7130126 7132337 - What happened?<br />- I don't know. I lost him.
7134839 7135882 Oh, shit.
7148269 7149729 Sentinels.
7150480 7152732 - How long?<br />- Five, maybe six minutes.
7154776 7156945 Tank, charge the EMP.
7157195 7160240 - We can't use that until he's out.<br />- I know. Don't worry.
7161408 7162492 He's gonna make it.
7162742 7164619 Flat or pumps? No, just...
7164869 7167747 What the shit? That's my phone!
7168164 7169749 That guy took my phone!
7172127 7174421 Got him!<br />He's on the run.
7174671 7177340 Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!
7177590 7179467 <i>I got an old exit.<br />Wabash and Lake.</i>
7183430 7184431 Oh, shit!
7205994 7207996 Help! Need a little help!
7209622 7210832 <i>The door.</i>
7226807 7228309 <i>The door on your left.</i>
7229226 7230478 <i>Your other left!</i>
7237193 7238444 <i>The back door.</i>
7259215 7260341 Oh, no.
7262009 7263511 Here they come.
7292289 7293541 He's going to make it.
7303759 7306887 <i>The fire escape at the end<br />of the alley, room 303.</i>
7342007 7343091 They're inside.
7345427 7346469 Hurry, Neo.
7402692 7403818 It can't be.
7411618 7412994 Check him.
7416998 7418541 He's gone.
7425257 7427676 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7435268 7436310 Neo...
7437770 7439730 I'm not afraid anymore.
7441357 7442692 The Oracle told me...
7442858 7448281 I'd fall in love, and that<br />the man I loved would be the One.
7451409 7453369 So you see...
7454078 7456080 you can't be dead.
7457665 7459500 You can't be...
7461043 7463212 because I love you.
7465047 7466757 You hear me?
7467883 7469552 I love you.
7493284 7494577 Now, get up.
7503252 7504420 No.
7531155 7532198 How?
7533074 7534116 He is the One.
7620871 7622330 Neo!
7678596 7680306 <i>I know you're out there.</i>
7680556 7682391 <i>I can feel you now.</i>
7682808 7686437 <i>I know that you're afraid.<br />You're afraid of us.</i>
7686771 7688606 <i>You're afraid of change.</i>
7690066 7691400 <i>I don't know the future.</i>
7691567 7694153 <i>I didn't come here to tell you<br />how this is going to end.</i>
7694403 7697365 <i>I came here to tell you<br />how it's going to begin.</i>
7698324 7699909 <i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>
7700159 7703246 <i>And then I'll show these people<br />what you don't want them to see.</i>
7703496 7705373 <i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>
7705623 7707375 <i>without you.</i>
7707667 7711295 <i>A world without rules and controls,<br />without borders or boundaries.</i>
7711546 7715258 <i>A world where anything is possible.</i>
7717885 7719220 <i>Where we go from there...</i>
7719470 7721430 <i>is a choice I leave to you.</i>
