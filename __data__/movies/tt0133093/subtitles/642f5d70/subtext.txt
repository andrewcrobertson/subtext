149691 154112 You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"<br />crap, you can cram it up your ass.
154571 157074 The orders were for your protection.

158575 160786 I think we can handle one little girl.
165916 167668 I sent two units!

169753 172881 No, lieutenant, your men<br />are already dead.
201952 203036 TRINITY:<br />Shit.
205956 208041 Morpheus, the line was traced.<br />I don't know how.
208291 209918 MORPHEUS:<br /><i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>
210127 212295 <i>There's no time.<br />Get to another exit.</i>
212546 214965 -Are there any agents?<br />MORPHEUS: <i>Yes.</i>

482524 484359 Yeah. Yeah.
490907 492075 You're two hours late.
492659 494411 I know. It's her fault.
494577 495662 You got the money?
497789 498957 Two grand.

518643 520020 CHOI:<br />Hallelujah.
520270 523148 You're my savior.<br />My own personal Jesus Christ.
523398 525275 You get caught using that...
525525 527652 I know. This never happened.<br />You don't exist.
528778 530864 NEO: Right.<br />CHOI: Something wrong, man?
531114 533158 You look a little whiter than usual.
534284 536453 My computer, it...
539456 544002 Ever have that feeling where you're<br />not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
544794 547547 All the time.<br />It's called mescaline.
548048 550175 It's the only way to fly.

569027 571654 It'll be fun. I promise.
578161 579662 Yeah.

582832 584292 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]
609943 611027 Hello, Neo.
612362 613530 How do you know that name?
614364 616074 I know a lot about you.
616950 619035 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
619994 621204 Trinity.
622831 623998 The Trinity?
624457 626167 That cracked the IRS D-base?
626417 627877 That was a long time ago.
628128 630046 - Jesus.<br />- What?
630505 632298 I just thought...
634050 635218 ...you were a guy.
635468 636928 Most guys do.
638138 640348 That was you on my computer.
640974 642058 How did you do that?
642725 645436 Right now, all I can tell you...
646062 647605 ...is that you're in danger.
648064 650483 TRINITY: I brought you here to warn you.<br />- Of what?
651067 652735 They're watching you, Neo.
653319 655738 - Who is?<br />- Please just listen.
659242 661077 I know why you're here, Neo.
661870 663830 I know what you've been doing.
664080 665957 I know why you hardly sleep...
666249 669377 ...why you live alone and why,<br />night after night...
669627 671963 ...you sit at your computer.
673131 674674 You're looking for him.
675466 678469 I know, because I was once<br />looking for the same thing.
678970 681097 And when he found me...
681723 684809 ...he told me I wasn't really<br />looking for him...
685727 687478 ...I was looking for an answer.
688104 691232 It's the question that drives us, Neo.
691900 694569 It's the question<br />that brought you here.
696654 698031 You know the question...
698281 699782 ...just as I did.
701326 702952 What is the Matrix?
703203 705663 The answer is out there, Neo.
706331 708333 It's looking for you.
709125 710793 And it will find you...
711085 713087 ...if you want it to.

719802 720845 Shit.

732482 735318 You have a problem with authority,<br />Mr. Anderson.
735568 739614 You believe that you are special,<br />that the rules do not apply to you.
740323 742325 Obviously, you are mistaken.
745286 748164 This is one of the top<br />software companies in the world...
748414 751793 ...because employees understand<br />they are part of a whole.
752043 756673 Thus, if an employee has a problem,<br />the company has a problem.
758925 762136 The time has come to make<br />a choice, Mr. Anderson.
763012 766891 Either you choose to be at your desk<br />on time from this day forth...
767517 770103 ...or you choose to find another job.
770979 772313 Do I make myself clear?
772563 774983 Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.<br />Perfectly clear.
783116 784325 MESSENGER:<br />Thomas Anderson?

826409 829579 <i>I don't know if you're ready to see<br />what I want to show you.</i>

867158 870328 <i>I can guide you,<br />but you must do exactly as I say.</i>
870536 873206 - Okay.<br /><i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>
876334 878461 - But what if they...<br /><i>- Go. Now.</i>
885218 887595 <i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>
894811 897563 <i>When I tell you,<br />go to the end of the row...</i>
897814 899774 <i>...to the office<br />at the end of the hall.</i>
900024 902402 <i>Stay as low as you can.</i>
904695 905822 <i>Go. Now.</i>
920211 923756 <i>Good. Now, outside<br />there is a scaffold.</i>
926467 928803 - How do you know this?<br /><i>- We don't have time.</i>
929053 931889 <i>To your left there's a window.<br />Go to it.</i>
934142 935685 <i>Open it.</i>
936519 938312 <i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>
938563 941149 No way! No way!<br />This is crazy!
941399 943776 <i>There are two ways<br />out of this building.</i>
944026 947822 <i>One is that scaffold.<br />The other is in their custody.</i>
948072 951284 <i>You take a chance either way.<br />I leave it to you.</i>
954871 956622 This is insane!
957790 959667 Why is this happening to me?
959959 961586 What'd I do?
961961 964714 I'm nobody.<br />I didn't do anything.
965298 966757 I'm gonna die.
976559 977602 Shit!
997872 998998 Oh, shit!
1003961 1005755 I can't do this.
1018392 1019435 Shit.
1068693 1073531 As you can see, we've had our eye on<br />you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
1074824 1077493 It seems that you've been living...
1077743 1079870 ...two lives.
1081289 1083791 In one life,<br />you're Thomas A. Anderson...
1084041 1087378 ...program writer for<br />a respectable software company.
1088421 1091716 You have a social security number.<br />You pay your taxes.
1092174 1093426 And you...
1095011 1098639 ...help your landlady<br />carry out her garbage.
1101142 1104270 The other life is lived in computers...
1104562 1107523 ...where you go by<br />the hacker alias "Neo"...
1107773 1112570 ...and are guilty of virtually every<br />computer crime we have a law for.
1113863 1115823 One of these lives...
1116073 1117908 ...has a future.
1118242 1120244 And one of them does not.
1123956 1127793 I'm going to be as forthcoming<br />as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
1128794 1130129 You're here...
1130463 1132715 ...because we need your help.
1136344 1139347 We know that you've been contacted<br />by a certain...
1139597 1141390 ...individual.
1142308 1146354 A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
1147355 1151359 Whatever you think you know<br />about this man is irrelevant.
1151609 1154028 He is considered by many authorities...
1154278 1157323 ...to be the most dangerous man alive.
1160034 1161243 My colleagues...
1161702 1164622 ...believe that I am wasting<br />my time with you.
1164914 1168334 But I believe you wish<br />to do the right thing.
1168626 1172129 We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
1172505 1174632 ...give you a fresh start.
1175132 1178052 All we're asking in return<br />is your cooperation...
1178302 1181806 ...in bringing<br />a known terrorist to justice.
1183182 1184433 Yeah.
1185726 1187812 That sounds like a really good deal.
1189438 1191190 But I got a better one.
1191440 1192942 How about...
1193359 1195361 ...I give you the finger...
1197947 1199949 ...and you give me my phone call.
1202159 1203994 Mr. Anderson...
1208165 1209208 ...you disappoint me.
1209458 1212086 You can't scare me<br />with this gestapo crap.
1212336 1213713 I know my rights.
1213963 1215464 I want my phone call.
1216048 1218217 Tell me, Mr. Anderson...
1219093 1220511 ...what good is a phone call...
1220761 1224348 ...if you're unable to speak?
1258132 1260342 You're going to help us,<br />Mr. Anderson...
1260843 1263012 ...whether you want to or not.

1329495 1331330 <i>If they knew what I know...</i>
1331580 1333582 <i>...you would probably be dead.</i>
1334583 1338295 What are you talking about?<br />What is happening to me?
1338546 1343384 <i>You are the One, Neo. You may have<br />spent the last few years...</i>
1343634 1346595 <i>...looking for me, but I've spent<br />my entire life...</i>
1346846 1348347 <i>...looking for you.</i>
1349890 1352059 <i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>
1353018 1355896 - Yes.<br /><i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>
1366115 1367324 Get in.
1379378 1380421 What's this?
1380671 1383215 It's necessary, Neo.<br />For our protection.
1383465 1385634 - From what?<br />- From you.
1387177 1388637 - Take off your shirt.<br />- What?
1388804 1389972 Stop the car.
1394560 1395728 Listen, coppertop.
1395978 1397980 We don't have time for 20 Questions.
1398480 1400858 Right now, there's only one rule:
1401150 1402484 Our way...
1402818 1403903 ...or the highway.
1410451 1411535 Fine.
1413412 1415873 Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
1416457 1419084 - Why?<br />- Because you have been down there.
1419835 1421045 You know that road.
1422046 1423672 You know exactly where it ends.
1425883 1428135 And I know that's<br />not where you want to be.
1442316 1443859 Apoc, lights.
1446362 1448530 TRINITY: Lie back.<br />Lift up your shirt.
1450449 1452701 - What's that?<br />- You're bugged.
1460459 1461919 Try and relax.
1468217 1469385 Come on.
1470427 1471470 Come on.
1473222 1474223 It's on the move.
1476016 1477226 Come on, you shit.
1479061 1481313 - You're gonna lose it.<br />- No, I'm not.
1481480 1482564 Clear!
1491156 1493283 Jesus Christ!<br />That thing's real!?
1527026 1528360 This is it.
1531697 1534158 Let me give you one piece of advice.
1535117 1536785 Be honest.
1538370 1540581 He knows more than you can imagine.
1549298 1550632 At last.
1552176 1553260 Welcome, Neo.
1554470 1556388 As you no doubt have guessed...
1556638 1557890 ...I am Morpheus.
1558932 1560517 It's an honor to meet you.
1560976 1562019 No...
1562603 1563896 ...the honor is mine.
1564813 1567316 Please, come. Sit.
1582414 1584041 I imagine...
1584458 1587211 ...that right now you're feeling<br />a bit like Alice...
1588921 1591340 ...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
1592174 1593258 You could say that.
1594176 1596804 I can see it in your eyes.
1597387 1600682 You have the look of a man<br />who accepts what he sees...
1600933 1603185 ...because he's expecting to wake up.
1604603 1607189 Ironically, this is not<br />far from the truth.
1607898 1610275 Do you believe in fate, Neo?
1610442 1611527 No.
1611944 1612986 Why not?
1613237 1616031 I don't like the idea that<br />I'm not in control of my life.
1617116 1620452 I know exactly what you mean.
1624748 1627126 Let me tell you why you're here.
1628168 1629711 You know something.
1630254 1631880 What you know,<br />you can't explain.
1632381 1633966 But you feel it.
1634550 1636468 You felt it your entire life:
1637052 1641223 Something's wrong with the world.<br />You don't know what, but it's there.
1641723 1643934 Like a splinter in your mind...
1644184 1646061 ...driving you mad.
1646979 1649731 It is this feeling<br />that has brought you to me.
1652276 1654111 Do you know what<br />I'm talking about?
1655946 1657281 The Matrix?
1659783 1661451 Do you want to know...
1661910 1663912 ...what it is?
1666290 1668167 The Matrix is everywhere.
1668417 1670127 It is all around us.
1670377 1672337 Even now, in this very room.
1673172 1675382 You can see it when you<br />look out your window...
1675632 1677968 ...or when you turn on your television.
1678385 1680929 You can feel it when you go to work...
1682472 1684141 ...when you go to church...
1684558 1686643 ...when you pay your taxes.
1687769 1690689 It is the world that has been<br />pulled over your eyes...
1690939 1692524 ...to blind you from the truth.
1694735 1695986 What truth?
1700240 1701783 That you are a slave.
1703285 1705579 Like everyone else,<br />you were born into bondage...
1705829 1710500 ...born into a prison that you cannot<br />smell or taste or touch.
1710792 1712085 A prison...
1712336 1713462 ...for your mind.
1720469 1722804 Unfortunately, no one can be...
1723138 1725515 ...told what the Matrix is.
1728977 1730854 You have to see it for yourself.
1740364 1742658 This is your last chance.
1742908 1745244 After this, there is no turning back.
1745702 1747162 You take the blue pill...
1747496 1750540 ...the story ends, you wake up<br />in your bed and believe...
1750791 1752584 ...whatever you want to believe.
1752834 1754169 You take the red pill...
1754419 1756380 ...you stay in Wonderland...
1756880 1759591 ...and I show you how deep<br />the rabbit hole goes.
1769476 1770686 Remember...
1771520 1774564 ...all I'm offering is the truth.<br />Nothing more.
1788870 1790205 Follow me.
1792749 1794418 Apoc, are we on-line?
1794668 1796044 APOC:<br />Almost.
1799381 1801425 MORPHEUS:<br />Time is always against us.
1801800 1803302 Please take a seat there.
1821486 1823196 -You did all this?<br />TRINITY: Mm-hm.
1827326 1829328 The pill you took is<br />part of a trace program.
1830078 1834708 It disrupts your carrier signals<br />so we can pinpoint your location.
1835250 1836293 What does that mean?
1836877 1839046 It means buckle your<br />seat belt, Dorothy...
1839379 1840714 ...because Kansas...
1840964 1842007 ...is going bye-bye.
1879920 1881296 Did you...?
1892307 1896395 Have you ever had a dream, Neo,<br />that you were so sure was real?
1897854 1900440 What if you were unable<br />to wake from that dream?
1900690 1903193 How would you know the difference<br />between the dream world...
1903819 1905237 ...and the real world?
1906863 1908031 NEO:<br />This can't be.
1908198 1909241 MORPHEUS:<br />Be what?
1909950 1911451 Be real?
1915414 1916832 - Going into replication.<br />- Apoc?
1917040 1918041 Still nothing.
1918625 1919835 NEO:<br />It's cold.
1920085 1921461 It's cold!
1925340 1927008 Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
1928510 1931179 - I got a fibrillation.<br />- Apoc, location.
1931430 1932889 APOC:<br />Targeting almost there.
1936184 1937602 He's going into arrest.
1937853 1940355 - Lock. I got him!<br />- Now, Tank, now!
2117616 2118700 Welcome...
2119034 2120952 ...to the real world.
2122370 2124205 MORPHEUS:<br />We've done it, Trinity.
2124456 2125999 We found him.
2126249 2129044 -I hope you're right.<br />MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.
2129628 2131212 I know it.
2136384 2137427 Am I dead?
2137927 2140096 Far from it.
2154069 2155487 He still needs a lot of work.
2157030 2158114 What are you doing?
2158365 2160575 Your muscles atrophied.<br />We're rebuilding them.
2161159 2162702 Why do my eyes hurt?
2163411 2165288 You've never used them before.
2169042 2170085 Rest, Neo.
2170335 2172003 The answers are coming.
2242657 2244242 [DOOR OPENS]
2246578 2248163 Morpheus, what's happened to me?
2248788 2249873 What is this place?
2250123 2252792 More important than "what" is "when."
2253293 2254335 "When"?
2254544 2256588 You believe it's the year 1999...
2256838 2259090 ...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.
2260216 2262969 I can't tell you exactly<br />what year it is...
2263219 2264846 ...because we honestly don't know.
2265346 2268183 There's nothing I can say<br />that will explain it for you.
2268433 2271186 Come with me.<br />See for yourself.
2271728 2273480 MORPHEUS:<br />This is my ship.
2273772 2276691 The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i><br />It's a hovercraft.
2279527 2281279 This is the main deck.
2287035 2288286 This is the core...
2290789 2294542 ...where we broadcast our pirate signal<br />and hack into the Matrix.
2297921 2301090 Most of my crew you already know.
2306095 2307514 This is Apoc...
2308306 2309641 ...Switch...
2311226 2312393 - ...and Cypher.<br />- Hi.
2312644 2316356 The ones you don't know:<br />Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
2317232 2319651 The little one behind you is Mouse.
2323988 2327242 You wanted to know<br />what the Matrix is?
2328284 2329494 Trinity.
2350515 2352100 Try to relax.
2356980 2358815 This will feel a little weird.
2370785 2372161 This...
2372328 2374038 ...is the Construct.
2374455 2376583 It's our loading program.
2376833 2379294 We can load anything, from clothing...
2379544 2380920 ...to equipment...
2381212 2382547 ...weapons...
2383172 2385008 ...training simulations...
2385383 2387927 ...anything we need.
2390722 2393141 NEO: Right now we're inside<br />a computer program?
2393433 2395351 Is it really so hard to believe?
2395852 2398479 Your clothes are different.<br />The plugs in your body are gone.
2399689 2401774 Your hair has changed.
2402150 2405486 Your appearance now is what we call<br />"residual self-image."
2406195 2408823 It is the mental projection<br />of your digital self.
2414704 2415830 This isn't real?
2416080 2417624 What is "real"?
2417999 2420251 How do you define "real"?
2420543 2422462 If you're talking about<br />what you can feel...
2422712 2425131 ...what you can smell, taste and see...
2425381 2429260 ...then "real" is simply electrical<br />signals interpreted by your brain.
2433431 2435850 This is the world that you know.
2437268 2440313 The world as it was at the end<br />of the 20th century.
2442690 2447028 It exists now only as part of<br />a neural-interactive simulation...
2447278 2448529 ...that we call the Matrix.
2453076 2455870 You've been living<br />in a dream world, Neo.
2456871 2457997 This is the world...
2458289 2460041 ...as it exists today.
2473096 2476057 Welcome to "the desert...
2476933 2478518 ...of the real."
2481896 2484273 We have only bits and pieces<br />of information.
2484524 2488319 But what we know for certain<br />is that in the early 21st century...
2488569 2491823 ...all of mankind was united<br />in celebration.
2492073 2496828 We marveled at our own magnificence<br />as we gave birth to AI.
2497620 2498746 AI.
2499789 2501165 You mean artificial intelligence.
2501416 2505837 A singular consciousness that spawned<br />an entire race of machines.
2506671 2510133 We don't know who struck first,<br />us or them.
2510550 2513761 But we know that it was us<br />that scorched the sky.
2515430 2517598 They were dependent on solar power...
2517849 2521185 ...and it was believed that<br />they would be unable to survive...
2521519 2525023 ...without an energy source<br />as abundant as the sun.
2525273 2530153 Throughout human history, we have<br />been dependent on machines to survive.
2531612 2535825 Fate, it seems, is not<br />without a sense of irony.
2539037 2543458 The human body generates more<br />bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
2543708 2547837 And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
2549756 2551924 Combined with a form of fusion...
2552258 2557096 ...the machines had found all the energy<br />they would ever need.
2561142 2564896 There are fields, Neo,<br />endless fields...
2565146 2568399 ...where human beings<br />are no longer born.
2569108 2570943 We are grown.
2576991 2579577 For the longest time,<br />I wouldn't believe it.
2579827 2582497 And then I saw the fields<br />with my own eyes...
2583831 2585458 ...watched them liquefy the dead...
2585708 2589045 ...so they could be fed intravenously<br />to the living.
2589587 2593841 And standing there,<br />facing the pure, horrifying precision...
2594092 2597011 ...I came to realize<br />the obviousness of the truth.
2599639 2601432 What is the Matrix?
2602642 2603684 Control.
2605061 2608439 The Matrix is a computer-generated<br />dream world...
2609232 2612318 ...built to keep us under control...
2613486 2616656 ...in order to change a human being...
2617281 2618449 ...into this.
2619826 2620952 No.
2622578 2624163 I don't believe it.
2624539 2625748 It's not possible.
2626332 2630920 I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.<br />I just said it would be the truth.
2631170 2632463 Stop!
2633005 2634215 Let me out!
2634924 2636843 Let me out! I want out!
2638803 2641472 - Easy, Neo. Easy.<br />- Get this thing out of me.
2641722 2643391 Get this thing out of me!
2645184 2646686 Don't touch me!
2646936 2648563 Stay away from me!
2648980 2650481 I don't believe it.
2651190 2652400 I don't believe it.
2652650 2654152 I don't believe it.
2654402 2656445 - He's gonna pop.<br />- Breathe, Neo.
2656821 2657905 Just breathe.
2676299 2678092 I can't go back, can I?
2678926 2680344 No.
2681179 2682388 But if you could...
2683222 2684724 ...would you really want to?
2687226 2688603 I owe you an apology.
2689187 2690563 We have a rule.
2691022 2694275 We never free a mind<br />once it's reached a certain age.
2694442 2695526 It's dangerous.
2696235 2697945 The mind has trouble letting go.
2698196 2700489 I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
2701532 2703618 I did what I did because...
2704327 2705786 ...I had to.
2714212 2718299 When the Matrix was first built,<br />there was a man born inside...
2718799 2722595 ...who had the ability<br />to change whatever he wanted...
2722970 2725890 ...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
2727642 2731103 It was he who freed the first of us...
2731979 2733606 ...taught us the truth.
2735066 2738152 As long as the Matrix exists...
2738486 2740571 ...the human race will never be free.
2744784 2746327 After he died...
2747078 2749789 ...the Oracle prophesied his return...
2750331 2753542 ...and that his coming would hail<br />the destruction of the Matrix...
2753793 2755461 ...end the war...
2755795 2757046 ...bring freedom to our people.
2758381 2763010 That is why there are those of us who<br />spent our lives searching the Matrix...
2763344 2764929 ...looking for him.
2767348 2769433 I did what I did because...
2771060 2773187 ...I believe that search is over.
2778276 2779694 Get some rest.
2780319 2782113 You're going to need it.
2784824 2785866 For what?
2788911 2790121 Your training.
2808431 2810141 Morning. Did you sleep?
2811017 2812226 You will tonight.
2812601 2814145 I guarantee it.
2815646 2817565 I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
2818024 2820443 - You don't have any...<br />- Holes? Nope.
2821360 2826073 Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%<br />pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
2826324 2827533 Born free right here...
2828075 2829410 ...in the real world.
2829660 2831329 Genuine child of Zion.
2832163 2834623 - Zion?<br />- If the war was over tomorrow...
2834874 2836375 ...Zion's where the party would be.
2836792 2838085 It's a city?
2838336 2841505 The last human city.<br />The only place we have left.
2843090 2844342 Where is it?
2846093 2849513 Deep underground near the Earth's core,<br />where it's still warm.
2851140 2853017 You live long enough,<br />you might see it.
2855269 2860107 Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited<br />to see what you're capable of...
2860358 2862109 ...if Morpheus is right and all.
2862610 2865363 We're not supposed to<br />talk about this, but...
2865613 2867031 ...if you are...
2868115 2870117 ...it's a very exciting time.
2871160 2873871 We got a lot to do.<br />We gotta get to it.
2877792 2880711 We're supposed to start<br />with these programs first.
2881712 2885174 That's major boring shit.<br />Let's do something more fun.
2885508 2886967 How about...
2888552 2890304 ...combat training?
2896352 2897812 "Jujitsu"?
2898687 2900356 I'm going to learn jujitsu?
2911700 2912910 Holy shit!
2913160 2915496 "Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
2915830 2917123 How about some more?
2917373 2918666 Hell, yes.
2920751 2921794 Hell, yeah.
2933973 2935057 How is he?
2935307 2937476 Ten hours straight.<br />He's a machine.
2948696 2950072 I know kung fu.
2951740 2952741 Show me.
2954535 2956287 This is a sparring program...
2956537 2959331 ...similar to the programmed reality<br />of the Matrix.
2959582 2961917 It has the same basic rules.<br />Like gravity.
2962168 2965629 These rules are no different<br />than those of a computer system.
2966172 2967673 Some of them can be bent.
2967882 2970342 Others can be broken.
2970885 2971969 Understand?
2973053 2974096 Then hit me...
2974680 2975806 ...if you can.
3014803 3015846 Good!
3016597 3017765 Adaptation.
3018057 3019266 Improvisation.
3019558 3020893 But your weakness...
3021143 3022520 ...is not your technique.
3029485 3031570 Morpheus is fighting Neo.
3103851 3105019 How did I beat you?
3111609 3112693 You're too fast.
3113235 3114570 Do you believe that...
3114945 3117448 ...my being stronger or faster...
3117698 3121368 ...has anything to do<br />with my muscles in this place?
3125414 3127207 You think you're breathing air?
3140721 3141930 Again!
3153400 3155819 Jesus Christ, he's fast!
3156070 3158280 His neuro-kinetics<br />are way above normal.
3163744 3165204 What are you waiting for?
3165454 3167414 You're faster than this.
3169625 3171835 Don't think you are.
3172086 3173754 Know you are.
3184139 3186934 Come on! Stop trying to hit me,<br />and hit me!
3196860 3198612 I don't believe it.
3200155 3202282 I know what you're trying to do.
3203951 3206120 I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
3206453 3208539 But I can only show you the door.
3209123 3210958 You have to walk through it.
3213335 3215462 Tank, load the jump program.
3227057 3229768 You have to let it all go, Neo.<br />Fear...
3230310 3232479 ...doubt and disbelief.
3233647 3236358 Free your mind.
3244616 3245743 Whoa.
3252541 3254251 Okey-dokey.
3256336 3257504 Free my mind.
3257963 3259089 What if he makes it?
3259339 3262050 -No one's ever made their first jump.<br />MOUSE: I know.
3263385 3265846 - But what if he does?<br />- He won't.
3266430 3267514 Come on.
3267765 3268932 All right.
3269391 3271435 No problem. Free my mind.
3272227 3275022 Free my mind. No problem. Right.
3294416 3296084 What does that mean?
3296460 3298295 It doesn't mean anything.
3298879 3301465 Everybody falls the first time.
3301924 3303217 Right, Trin?
3323904 3326532 - I thought it wasn't real.<br />- Your mind makes it real.
3329785 3332037 If you're killed in the Matrix...
3332204 3333247 ...you die here?
3333872 3336333 The body cannot live without the mind.
3366822 3370200 I don't remember you ever<br />bringing me dinner.
3373287 3376123 There is something about him,<br />isn't there?
3376748 3378375 You're a believer now?
3379376 3380586 I keep wondering...
3380836 3384506 ...if Morpheus is so sure,<br />why not take him to see the Oracle?
3385424 3388343 Morpheus will take him<br />when he's ready.
3398145 3399688 The Matrix is a system, Neo.
3401440 3402733 That system is our enemy.
3403358 3405694 But when you're inside,<br />what do you see?
3405944 3409740 Businessmen, teachers,<br />lawyers, carpenters.
3410198 3412784 The very minds of the people<br />we are trying to save.
3413035 3415996 But until we do, these people are<br />a part of that system...
3416246 3418165 ...and that makes them our enemy.
3418332 3419541 You have to understand...
3419791 3423128 ...most of these people are not<br />ready to be unplugged.
3423378 3424963 And many of them are so inert...
3425213 3427633 ...so hopelessly dependent<br />on the system...
3427883 3430594 ...that they will fight to protect it.
3432095 3435849 Were you listening to me or looking<br />at the woman in the red dress?
3436016 3437768 - I was...<br />- Look again.
3439019 3440103 Freeze it.
3446735 3448362 NEO: This isn't the Matrix?<br />MORPHEUS: No.
3450155 3453992 It's another training program<br />designed to teach you one thing:
3454618 3457037 If you are not one of us,<br />you are one of them.
3457579 3460374 - What are they?<br />- Sentient programs.
3461124 3465420 They can move in and out of any<br />software still hardwired to their system.
3465796 3469174 That means that anyone<br />we haven't unplugged...
3469508 3470842 ...is potentially an agent.
3471802 3473637 Inside the Matrix...
3474221 3475931 ...they are everyone...
3476264 3477975 ...and they are no one.
3478225 3481353 We have survived by hiding<br />and running from them...
3481603 3483230 ...but they are the gatekeepers.
3483480 3486441 They're guarding all the doors<br />and holding all the keys.
3486692 3489528 Sooner or later, someone will<br />have to fight them.
3489695 3490904 Someone?
3491238 3492656 MORPHEUS:<br />I won't lie to you, Neo.
3493115 3497953 Every single man or woman who<br />has fought an agent, has died.
3498203 3500580 But where they have failed,<br />you will succeed.
3500747 3501832 Why?
3502082 3504376 MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch<br />through a concrete wall.
3504626 3508213 Men have emptied entire clips at them<br />and hit nothing but air.
3508463 3513093 Yet their strength and speed are still<br />based in a world built on rules.
3513343 3514469 Because of that...
3514720 3518098 ...they will never be as strong<br />or as fast as you can be.
3522394 3524271 What are you telling me?
3524980 3526440 That I can dodge bullets?
3528442 3529818 No, Neo.
3530318 3533238 I'm trying to tell you<br />that when you're ready...
3534114 3535449 ...you won't have to.
3536783 3538285 [PHONE RINGS]
3539578 3540787 TANK:<br /><i>We got trouble.</i>
3559723 3562184 - Did Zion send the warning?<br />- No, another ship.
3565437 3566730 Shit.
3566980 3569858 - Squiddy's sweeping in quick.<br />- Squiddy?
3570067 3573278 A sentinel. A killing machine<br />designed for one thing.
3573528 3574738 Search and destroy.
3576073 3577240 Set her down there.
3598512 3600013 How are we doing, Tank?
3608730 3609898 Power off-line.
3610398 3612359 EMP armed...
3612901 3614444 - ...and ready.<br />- EMP?
3614736 3616613 Electromagnetic pulse.
3616863 3619741 Disables any electrical system<br />in the blast radius.
3619908 3622202 It's the only weapon we have<br />against the machines.
3627999 3631128 NEO: Where are we?<br />- Their old service and waste systems.
3632379 3633505 Sewers.
3633713 3636424 TRINITY: There used to be cities<br />that spanned hundreds of miles.
3636925 3638844 Now these sewers are<br />all that's left.
3639094 3640428 Quiet.
3681011 3682470 Whoa! Neo.
3684306 3686474 You scared the bejesus out of me.
3687559 3689477 - Sorry.<br />- It's okay.
3691980 3693231 Is that...?
3693481 3695066 The Matrix?
3695233 3696443 Yeah.
3698236 3701406 - Do you always look at it encoded?<br />- Well, you have to.
3701656 3704743 The image translators work<br />for the construct program.
3704993 3708413 But there's way too much information<br />to decode the Matrix.
3708663 3711625 You get used to it.<br />I don't even see the code.
3711875 3715295 All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
3716463 3717839 Do you...
3718131 3719216 ...want a drink?
3719466 3720508 Sure.
3724054 3725513 You know...
3726431 3727974 ...I know what you're thinking.
3728225 3730310 Because right now I'm thinking<br />the same thing.
3730644 3733980 Actually, I've been thinking it<br />ever since I got here.
3735899 3738902 Why, oh, why didn't I take<br />the blue pill?
3749454 3750705 [COUGHS]
3751289 3753208 Good shit, huh?
3753541 3754751 Dozer makes it.
3755210 3756378 It's good for two things:
3756628 3759714 Degreasing engines and<br />killing brain cells.
3760715 3762926 So can I ask you something?
3765929 3767555 Did he tell you why he did it?
3770183 3772018 Why you're here?
3775689 3777440 Jesus!
3778650 3780568 What a mind job.
3781987 3784781 So you're here to save the world.
3786283 3788368 What do you say<br />to something like that?
3793540 3794916 A little piece of advice.
3796710 3798128 You see an agent...
3798461 3800755 ...you do what we do:
3801089 3802632 Run.
3802966 3804718 You run your ass off.
3811975 3813685 Thanks for the drink.
3818398 3819566 Sweet dreams.
3823570 3826990 SMITH:<br />Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
3827657 3828783 You know...
3830201 3832662 ...I know this steak doesn't exist.
3833663 3836416 I know that when I put it<br />in my mouth...
3836666 3839753 ...the Matrix is telling my brain<br />that it is...
3840045 3841171 ...juicy...
3841463 3843173 ...and delicious.
3846092 3847344 After nine years...
3848386 3849929 ...you know what I realize?
3857771 3858980 Ignorance is bliss.
3864027 3865862 Then we have a deal.
3868365 3870283 I don't want to remember nothing.
3870533 3873036 Nothing. You understand?
3876915 3878917 And I want to be rich.
3880251 3882962 You know, someone important.
3884464 3885590 Like an actor.
3886800 3889928 Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
3892097 3893640 Okay.
3894015 3896434 You get my body<br />back in a power plant...
3896810 3898561 ...reinsert me into the Matrix...
3898895 3900313 ...I'll get you what you want.
3900563 3902565 Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
3902816 3904984 No. I told you, I don't know them.
3907946 3909948 I can get you the man who does.
3910698 3912492 Morpheus.
3922585 3926047 Here you go, buddy.<br />Breakfast of champions.
3927382 3930176 Close your eyes, it feels<br />like you're eating runny eggs.
3930385 3932095 Or a bowl of snot.
3932637 3934222 MOUSE:<br />You know what it reminds me of?
3936057 3938393 Tastee Wheat. Did you<br />ever eat Tastee Wheat?
3939018 3940728 No, but technically,<br />neither did you.
3940979 3943022 That's exactly my point. Exactly.
3943273 3944649 Because you have to wonder...
3944899 3948153 ...how do the machines really know<br />what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
3948403 3949821 Maybe they got it wrong.
3950071 3953283 Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat<br />tasted like, actually tasted like...
3953575 3955577 ...oatmeal or tuna fish.
3955952 3958788 That makes you wonder.<br />Take chicken, for example.
3959038 3961040 Maybe they didn't know<br />what to make it taste like...
3961291 3963334 ...which is why it tastes<br />like everything.
3963585 3965378 - And maybe they...<br />- Shut up.
3967005 3968465 DOZER:<br />It's a single-celled protein...
3968715 3971759 ...combined with synthetic aminos,<br />vitamins and minerals.
3972010 3973261 Everything the body needs.
3973511 3976389 It doesn't have everything<br />the body needs.
3979142 3982228 I understand you've run through<br />the agent training program.
3983271 3985315 You know, I wrote that program.
3985607 3986900 Here it comes.
3987150 3989110 MOUSE: What did you think of her?<br />NEO: Of who?
3989486 3992530 The woman in the red dress.<br />I designed her.
3992864 3995617 She doesn't talk very much...
3995867 3999829 ...but if you'd like to meet her,<br />I can arrange a more personal milieu.
4000079 4001456 The digital pimp hard at work.
4001706 4003958 Pay no attention to<br />these hypocrites, Neo.
4005251 4007086 To deny our own impulses...
4007337 4010465 ...is to deny the very thing<br />that makes us human.
4012383 4013760 Dozer, when you're done...
4013968 4015553 ...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
4016137 4017472 We're going in.
4018181 4019599 I'm taking Neo to see her.
4023520 4024771 See who?
4025772 4027023 The Oracle.
4032529 4034072 Everyone please observe...
4034405 4037116 ...the "fasten seat belt"<br />and "no smoking" signs are on.
4037617 4040995 Sit back and enjoy your flight.
4041246 4043039 [PHONE RINGS]
4065436 4066437 We're in.
4082078 4083246 We'll be back in an hour.
4086749 4089294 [PHONE DIALS, THEN RINGS]
4098011 4100013 MORPHEUS:<br />Unbelievable...
4100263 4101598 ...isn't it?
4105184 4107020 NEO: God!<br />- What?
4107687 4109063 I used to eat there.
4111316 4112942 Really good noodles.
4117739 4120241 I have these memories from my life.
4122702 4124370 None of them happened.
4125079 4126331 What does that mean?
4126581 4128791 That the Matrix cannot tell you<br />who you are.
4129709 4130918 But an oracle can?
4131377 4132587 That's different.
4137300 4138551 Did you go to her?
4140094 4141262 TRINITY:<br />Yes.
4141763 4143139 What did she tell you?
4146392 4147894 She told me...
4148936 4150104 What?
4153900 4155234 MORPHEUS:<br />We're here.
4155610 4157904 Neo, come with me.
4177882 4180301 So is this the same oracle<br />that made...
4180468 4181719 ...the prophecy?
4181969 4186307 Yes. She's very old. She's been<br />with us since the beginning.
4186766 4188768 NEO: The beginning?<br />- Of the Resistance.
4191020 4193398 And she knows what? Everything?
4195441 4197360 She would say she knows enough.
4198486 4200279 And she's never wrong.
4202490 4205660 MORPHEUS: Try not to think of it<br />in terms of right and wrong.
4205993 4207578 She is a guide, Neo.
4207954 4209831 She can help you to find the path.
4210331 4211582 She helped you?
4212291 4213334 Yes.
4214085 4215420 What did she tell you?
4217880 4220091 That I would find the One.
4233229 4235356 I told you I can only<br />show you the door.
4236065 4238151 You have to walk through it.
4241946 4243030 Hello, Neo.
4243281 4244949 You're right on time.
4252874 4256669 Make yourself at home, Morpheus.<br />Neo, come with me.
4262341 4263926 These are the other Potentials.
4264177 4265720 You can wait here.
4306552 4309096 BOY:<br />Do not try and bend the spoon.
4309472 4311599 That's impossible.
4312433 4316437 Instead, only try<br />to realize the truth.
4316979 4318356 What truth?
4318606 4320274 There is no spoon.
4322860 4324195 There is no spoon?
4324445 4328908 Then you'll see that it is not the spoon<br />that bends. It is only yourself.
4344966 4346425 The Oracle will you see now.
4357144 4358688 ORACLE:<br />I know you're Neo.
4359313 4360481 Be right with you.
4361524 4363901 - You're the Oracle?<br />- Bingo.
4366612 4369490 Not quite what you<br />were expecting, right?
4370533 4372702 Almost done.
4375204 4376831 Smell good, don't they?
4378082 4379333 Yeah.
4379584 4381419 ORACLE:<br />I'd ask you to sit down...
4381669 4384046 ...but you're not going to anyway.
4384547 4387425 - And don't worry about the vase.<br />- What vase?
4390553 4391721 That vase.
4392680 4393723 I'm sorry.
4393973 4395850 I said, don't worry about it.
4397018 4398978 I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
4399604 4400813 How did you know?
4402857 4406652 What's really going to bake<br />your noodle later on is...
4406986 4409947 ...would you still have broken it<br />if I hadn't said anything?
4414744 4416662 You're cuter than I thought.
4419707 4421959 I can see why she likes you.
4422835 4423920 Who?
4424170 4426005 Not too bright, though.
4429300 4432386 You know why Morpheus<br />brought you to see me.
4434513 4435681 So...
4436641 4438017 ...what do you think?
4439852 4441604 Do you think you are the One?
4443564 4444607 I don't know.
4448027 4449445 You know what that means?
4450279 4451447 It's Latin.
4451822 4454033 Means, "Know thyself."
4455493 4457453 I'll let you in on a little secret.
4459705 4463542 Being the One is just<br />like being in love.
4464251 4467129 No one can tell you you're in love.<br />You just know it...
4467380 4468506 ...through and through.
4468839 4470883 Balls to bones.
4473219 4474261 Well...
4476222 4478307 ...I'd better have a look at you.
4479642 4481143 Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
4495533 4497201 Okay...
4497827 4502790 Now I'm supposed to say,<br />"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."
4503290 4504417 Then you say:
4505084 4506293 But what?
4506544 4510506 But you already know<br />what I'm going to tell you.
4511924 4514885 - I'm not the One.<br />- Sorry, kid.
4516512 4518514 You got the gift...
4519432 4521726 ...but it looks like<br />you're waiting for something.
4526397 4527440 What?
4527690 4530568 Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
4531152 4533404 That's the way these things go.
4534280 4536866 - What's funny?<br />- Morpheus.
4540327 4542038 He almost had me convinced.
4542288 4543414 I know.
4544957 4547084 Poor Morpheus.
4549462 4552590 Without him, we're lost.
4554133 4556302 What do you mean, "without him"?
4560306 4562224 Are you sure you want<br />to hear this?
4564435 4567188 Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
4568898 4571067 And no one, not you, not even me...
4571317 4573569 ...can convince him otherwise.
4573944 4576322 He believes it so blindly...
4576614 4580951 ...that he's going to sacrifice<br />his life to save yours.
4581160 4582328 What?
4582495 4585164 ORACLE: You're going to<br />have to make a choice.
4585790 4589376 In the one hand,<br />you'll have Morpheus' life.
4589877 4592755 And in the other hand,<br />you'll have your own.
4594173 4596467 One of you is going to die.
4598552 4601847 Which one will be up to you.
4603224 4605142 I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
4605392 4607061 You have a good soul.
4608145 4610856 And I hate giving<br />good people bad news.
4613984 4615444 Don't worry about it.
4615694 4618114 As soon as you<br />step outside that door...
4618364 4620491 ...you'll start feeling better.
4621200 4624995 You'll remember you don't believe<br />in any of this fate crap.
4625830 4628582 You're in control of your own life.
4629416 4630709 Remember?
4632378 4633587 Here...
4635464 4637007 ...take a cookie.
4637550 4640886 I promise, by the time<br />you're done eating it...
4641846 4644223 ...you'll feel right as rain.
4653440 4654775 What was said...
4655401 4656861 ...was for you...
4657403 4659238 ...and for you alone.

4682178 4683262 They're on the way.
4713083 4714126 What is that?
4728891 4730309 Oh, déjà vu.
4733812 4734897 What did you just say?
4735147 4736649 Nothing.<br />Just déjà vu.
4736899 4738525 TRINITY: What did you see?<br />CYPHER: What happened?
4739944 4742112 A black cat went past us...
4742363 4743989 ...then another just like it.
4744240 4745783 Was it the same cat?
4746742 4749578 - I'm not sure.<br />- Switch, Apoc.
4753666 4754875 What is it?
4755125 4759546 A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the<br />Matrix when they change something.
4762508 4763759 Oh, my God.
4765552 4766553 Let's go.
4771809 4773602 They cut the hard line.<br />It's a trap! Get out!
4779066 4780317 Oh, no.
4820607 4823068 CYPHER: That's what they changed.<br />We're trapped.
4823319 4825195 MORPHEUS:<br />Be calm. Give me your phone.
4825446 4826989 TRINITY:<br />They'll be able to track it.
4827239 4828657 MORPHEUS:<br />We have no choice.
4830075 4831285 Operator.
4831618 4834455 MORPHEUS: <i>Find a structural drawing of<br />this building. Find it fast.</i>
4842296 4844882 -Got it!<br />MORPHEUS: <i>I need the main wet-wall.</i>
4847718 4848969 Eighth floor.
4849178 4850763 SMITH:<br /><i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>
4851055 4852514 MORPHEUS:<br />Switch, straight ahead.
4853265 4854433 APOC:<br />Neo...
4860564 4862691 I hope the Oracle<br />gave you some good news.
4870991 4872493 TANK:<br /><i>Now left. That's it.</i>
4872785 4873827 MORPHEUS:<br />Good.
4883545 4884838 Where are they?
4928132 4929174 [COUGHS]
4943522 4945107 [SNEEZES]
4945274 4946442 They're in the walls.
4947901 4949069 COP:<br />In the walls!
4970466 4972134 It's an agent!
4979433 4980767 Morpheus!
4980934 4982186 MORPHEUS:<br />You must get Neo out!
4982436 4984271 He's all that matters!
4984563 4986773 - No, Morpheus! Don't!<br />- Trinity, go!
4987733 4989067 Go!
4995324 4997242 - We can't leave him!<br />- We have to!
5021558 5023352 Cypher, come on!
5028273 5032110 The great Morpheus.<br />We meet at last.
5032653 5033779 And you are?
5034029 5035781 A Smith.
5036031 5037324 Agent Smith.
5037908 5039952 You all look the same to me.
5095591 5096883 Take him.
5103515 5104975 No!
5110105 5111940 -Operator.<br />CYPHER: <i>I need an exit, fast.</i>
5114026 5116945 There was an accident.<br />Goddamn car accident.
5117279 5119072 CYPHER:<br /><i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>
5119323 5120699 Somebody up there still likes me.
5120949 5122200 TANK:<br />I got you.
5122701 5124620 CYPHER:<br /><i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>
5124870 5127539 Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.<br />An old TV repair shop.
5127789 5128832 Right.
5131960 5133545 -Operator.<br />TRINITY: <i>Tank, it's me.</i>
5133795 5134963 Is Morpheus alive?
5135339 5136632 Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
5137049 5138967 <i>Yes. They're moving him.<br />I don't know where.</i>
5139176 5141470 He's alive. We need an exit.
5141720 5142804 You're not far from Cypher.
5142971 5144222 TRINITY: <i>Cypher?</i><br />- I know.
5144473 5146558 <i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i><br />- Got it.
5154358 5155400 [PHONE RINGS]
5155651 5156860 TANK:<br />Got him.
5167788 5168830 Where are they?
5169081 5170332 Making the call.
5170999 5172167 Good.
5173126 5174836 [PHONE RINGS]
5185305 5186556 You first.
5189768 5190977 Shit!
5194272 5195941 Tank!
5196108 5197734 No!
5199653 5201822 I don't know. It just went dead.
5207619 5210247 [PHONE RINGING]
5228640 5229850 CYPHER:<br /><i>Hello, Trinity.</i>
5230267 5231601 Cypher? Where's Tank?
5237190 5238233 You know...
5239943 5242070 ...for a long time...
5243280 5246158 ...I thought I was in love with you.
5246950 5248994 <i>I used to dream about you.</i>
5250078 5252789 You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
5253039 5255417 <i>Too bad things had to<br />turn out this way.</i>
5255959 5257002 You killed them.
5257502 5259004 - What?<br />- Oh, God.
5259254 5260672 I'm tired, Trinity.
5262090 5263967 I'm tired of this war...
5264259 5267095 ...tired of fighting.<br />I'm tired of this ship...
5267429 5272058 ...of being cold, of eating<br />the same goddamn goop every day.
5274269 5275395 But most of all...
5275979 5279357 <i>...I'm tired of that jackoff<br />and all of his bullshit.</i>
5280484 5281777 Surprise, asshole!
5282319 5284529 I bet you never saw this coming...
5284780 5285822 ...did you?
5288116 5290494 God, I wish I could be there...
5291077 5292579 ...when they break you.
5293622 5296792 I wish I could walk in<br />just when it happens...
5297501 5299211 ...so right then...
5299461 5300796 ...you'd know it was me.
5301296 5302464 You gave them Morpheus.
5302714 5304174 <i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>
5304758 5306259 He tricked us!
5306802 5308804 If you had told us the truth...
5309054 5311932 ...we would've told you to shove<br />that red pill up your ass!
5312182 5314309 That is not true, Cypher.<br />He set us free.
5314559 5317437 "Free." You call this free?
5319856 5322359 All I do is what he tells me to do.
5323944 5326863 If I had to choose between<br />that and the Matrix...
5328031 5329241 ...I choose the Matrix.
5329491 5331159 The Matrix isn't real.
5331409 5332828 <i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>
5333078 5335330 I think the Matrix...
5335664 5338250 ...can be more real than this world.
5340418 5342921 All I do is pull the plug here.
5343296 5344506 But there...
5345048 5347342 <i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
5348343 5349594 Trinity.
5355100 5358061 <i>- Welcome to the real world.</i><br />- But you're out, Cypher.
5358311 5360730 <i>- You can't go back.</i><br />- That's what you think.
5360981 5362482 <i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>
5362732 5366361 <i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,<br />I won't remember a thing.</i>
5366570 5367612 By the way...
5367863 5370824 ...if you have anything important<br />to say to Switch...
5371324 5372409 <i>...say it now.</i>
5372659 5375704 - No, please don't.<br />- Not like this.
5377414 5379040 Not like this.
5383503 5384546 Too late.
5385297 5386590 Goddamn you, Cypher!
5386840 5388717 Don't hate me, Trinity.
5389092 5390969 I'm just a messenger.
5391386 5394556 And right now,<br />I'm going to prove it to you.
5395640 5397309 If Morpheus was right...
5397851 5399728 ...there's no way<br />I can pull this plug.
5400312 5401813 <i>If Neo's the One...</i>
5402314 5404149 <i>...then there'd have to be...</i>
5404399 5406985 ...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
5407152 5408361 Right?
5408987 5411072 I mean, how can he be the One...
5411239 5412324 ...if he's dead?
5413700 5415952 <i>You never did answer me before...</i>
5416244 5418580 <i>...if you bought into<br />Morpheus' bullshit.</i>
5418955 5422167 Come on. All I want<br />is a little yes or no.
5423543 5425879 Look into his eyes...
5426630 5428131 <i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>
5430884 5432218 ...and tell me...
5432928 5434179 <i>...yes...</i>
5434512 5435889 <i>...or no.</i>
5437182 5438725 - Yes.<br /><i>- No!</i>
5438892 5440060 I don't believe it.
5441478 5446232 Believe it or not, you piece of shit,<br />you're still going to burn!
5453406 5454658 [PHONE RINGS]
5464501 5465877 You first.
5474094 5476388 - You're hurt.<br />- I'll be all right.
5479182 5480350 Dozer?
5498618 5500996 SMITH:<br />Have you ever stood and stared at it?
5501871 5505000 Marveled at its beauty...
5505375 5507627 ...its genius?
5508795 5510672 Billions of people...
5510922 5513675 ...just living out their lives.
5514718 5516386 Oblivious.
5520974 5523852 Did you know that the first Matrix...
5524102 5528773 ...was designed to be a perfect<br />human world where none suffered...
5529274 5532193 ...where everyone would be happy.
5532736 5534237 It was a disaster.
5534487 5538825 No one would accept the program.<br />Entire crops were lost.
5539701 5541453 Some believe that...
5541703 5546082 ...we lacked the programming language<br />to describe your perfect world.
5546332 5547876 But I believe that...
5548043 5549210 ...as a species...
5549461 5553298 ...human beings define<br />their reality through misery...
5553548 5554924 ...and suffering.
5555175 5557886 So the perfect world was a dream...
5558136 5562974 ...that your primitive cerebrum<br />kept trying to wake up from.
5564309 5567979 Which is why the Matrix was<br />redesigned to this.
5568438 5569939 The peak...
5570190 5571608 ...of your civilization.
5571858 5574110 I say, "your civilization"...
5574360 5578490 ...because when we started thinking<br />for you, it became our civilization...
5578740 5581826 ...which is, of course,<br />what this is all about.
5583161 5585747 Evolution, Morpheus.
5586039 5587373 Evolution.
5589667 5591544 Like the dinosaur.
5593713 5595340 Look out that window.
5596049 5598176 You had your time.
5598885 5602806 The future is our world, Morpheus.
5603139 5605517 The future is our time.
5609771 5610939 There could be a problem.
5611856 5615235 NEO: What are they doing to him?<br />- They're breaking into his mind.
5615485 5617654 It's like hacking a computer.<br />All it takes is time.
5617904 5619114 How much time?
5619364 5622492 Depends on the mind.<br />But eventually, it'll crack...
5622742 5627163 ...and his alpha patterns<br />will change from this to this.
5627413 5630375 When it does, he'll tell them<br />anything they want to know.
5630625 5631668 What do they want?
5631918 5635964 The leader of every ship is given<br />codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
5636214 5639134 If an agent got the codes<br />and got into Zion's mainframe...
5639384 5642470 ...they could destroy us.<br />We can't let that happen.
5642637 5644889 Trinity, Zion's more important than me...
5645056 5646224 ...or you...
5646391 5647684 ...or even Morpheus.
5651479 5653148 There has to be<br />something we can do.
5653565 5655567 There is. We pull the plug.
5658653 5660405 You're going to kill him?
5660655 5661823 Kill Morpheus?
5662448 5664075 We don't have a choice.
5670874 5673793 Never send a human<br />to do a machine's job.
5674043 5675795 If the insider has failed...
5676045 5679257 ...they'll sever the connection<br />as soon as possible, unless...
5679507 5681217 They're dead. In either case...
5681467 5685013 We have no choice. Continue as planned.<br />Deploy the sentinels.
5685263 5686347 Immediately.
5691603 5694272 Morpheus, you were more<br />than a leader to us.
5695231 5697442 You were a father.
5698985 5700945 We'll miss you always.
5707827 5709037 Stop!
5710205 5711539 I don't believe this is happening.
5711706 5713750 -Neo, this has to be done.<br />NEO: Does it?
5714542 5715919 I don't know.
5716252 5718713 - This can't be just coincidence.<br />- What?
5718922 5720173 NEO:<br />The Oracle.
5720423 5722217 She told me this would happen.
5722634 5726804 She told me that I would<br />have to make a choice.
5727263 5728473 What choice?
5731476 5733978 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm going in.
5734312 5736648 TRINITY: No, you're not.<br />- I have to.
5736856 5740485 Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself<br />so that we could get you out.
5740735 5742654 There is no way<br />that you're going back in.
5743238 5746491 Morpheus did what he did because<br />he believed I'm something I'm not.
5747992 5749035 What?
5749744 5751371 I'm not the One, Trinity.
5751746 5754707 - The Oracle hit me with that too.<br />- No, you have to be.
5754958 5757627 I'm sorry, I'm not.<br />I'm just another guy.
5758294 5759545 No, Neo, that's not true.
5760129 5762757 - It can't be true.<br />- Why?
5767178 5770515 This is loco. They've got Morpheus<br />in a military-controlled building.
5770765 5775144 Even if you somehow got inside, those<br />are agents holding him. Three of them.
5776437 5780358 I want Morpheus back too, but<br />what you're talking about is suicide.
5780608 5782193 That's what it looks like...
5782360 5783403 ...but it's not.
5783653 5786030 I can't explain to you why it's not.
5787115 5790827 Morpheus believed something, and<br />he was ready to give his life for it.
5791077 5794080 I understand that now.<br />That's why I have to go.
5794372 5796874 - Why?<br />- Because I believe in something.
5797041 5798668 What?
5799377 5801087 I believe I can bring him back.
5818062 5819981 - What are you doing?<br />- Going with you.
5820273 5822275 - No, you're not.<br />- "No"?
5823443 5825570 Let me tell you what I believe.
5826070 5828448 Morpheus means more to me<br />than he does to you.
5828781 5833077 I believe if you are serious about<br />saving him, you will need my help.
5833328 5835371 And since I am the ranking officer...
5835621 5838499 ...if you don't like it,<br />I believe you can go to hell.
5839250 5841669 Because you aren't going anywhere else.
5842086 5843629 Tank...
5843796 5844922 ...load us up.
5854557 5857852 I'd like to share<br />a revelation that I've had...
5858269 5859812 ...during my time here.
5860063 5864067 It came to me when I tried<br />to classify your species...
5864317 5866569 ...and I realized...
5866819 5869113 ...that you're not actually mammals.
5871324 5873785 Every mammal on this planet...
5874118 5879040 ...instinctively develops an equilibrium<br />with the surrounding environment.
5879290 5881125 But you humans do not.
5881667 5885213 You move to an area<br />and you multiply...
5885463 5889967 ...and multiply until every<br />natural resource is consumed.
5890301 5892387 The only way you can survive...
5892678 5895640 ...is to spread to another area.
5901062 5903940 There is another organism<br />on this planet...
5904190 5906150 ...that follows the same pattern.
5906776 5908444 Do you know what it is?
5908820 5910655 A virus.
5911989 5915034 Human beings are a disease.
5915410 5916953 A cancer of this planet.
5917203 5919330 You are a plague.
5919872 5921290 And we...
5921457 5922834 ...are the cure.
5923835 5925253 Okay, so what do you need?
5925878 5927004 Besides a miracle.
5927588 5928798 Guns.
5929632 5930842 Lots of guns.
5940726 5941936 Neo...
5943688 5946232 No one has ever done<br />anything like this.
5947442 5949360 That's why it's going to work.
5953448 5955366 Why isn't the serum working?
5955992 5958286 Perhaps we're asking<br />the wrong questions.
5960371 5961622 Leave me with him.
5964208 5965334 Now.
5976554 5978139 TANK:<br />Hold on, Morpheus.
5978389 5981100 They're coming for you.<br />They're coming.
5983478 5985605 SMITH:<br />Can you hear me, Morpheus?
5985855 5988524 I'm going to be honest...
5988900 5990109 ...with you.
5994489 5995907 I...
5996782 5997909 ...hate...
5998159 6000119 ...this place...
6000453 6002747 ...this zoo...
6002997 6004123 ...this prison...
6004373 6007543 ...this reality,<br />whatever you want to call it.
6007793 6010087 I can't stand it any longer.
6010838 6012715 It's the smell.
6014091 6015968 If there is such a thing.
6016302 6019597 I feel saturated by it.
6021098 6022391 I can...
6022642 6024185 ...taste...
6024352 6026395 ...your stink.
6026646 6030274 And every time I do, I fear that<br />I have somehow been infected by it.
6030441 6031442 It's repulsive.
6032443 6033819 Isn't it?
6035988 6038282 I must get out of here.
6038699 6040910 I must get free.
6041160 6044038 And in this mind is the key.
6044288 6045957 My key.
6046207 6049085 Once Zion is destroyed,<br />there is no need for me to be here.
6049335 6050962 Do you understand?
6051254 6052630 I need the codes.
6052880 6055216 I have to get inside Zion...
6055550 6058052 ...and you have to tell me how.
6058469 6060346 You're going to tell me...
6060596 6062765 ...or you're going to die.
6082952 6086080 Please remove any metallic items<br />you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
6090001 6091043 Holy shit!
6103139 6105850 Backup. Send backup.
6129665 6130791 Freeze!
6265634 6266844 What were you doing?
6268679 6269972 He doesn't know.
6270222 6271724 Know what?
6299794 6302296 I think they're trying to save him.
6317144 6318896 There is no spoon.
6348509 6350678 Find them and destroy them!
6352304 6354139 We're under attack!
6386255 6387423 Trinity!
6387923 6389008 Help!
6411030 6412239 Only human.
6413198 6414283 Dodge this.
6427504 6429006 - How did you do that?<br />- Do what?
6429423 6433344 You moved like they do.<br />I've never seen anyone move that fast.
6434470 6435846 It wasn't fast enough.
6438599 6439892 Can you fly that thing?
6441018 6442019 Not yet.
6445314 6446357 Operator.

6476136 6477221 No.
6528814 6531442 Morpheus, get up.<br />Get up, get up.
6569480 6570522 He's not going to make it.
6580324 6581366 Got you.
6647432 6648600 Trinity!
6690267 6691685 I knew it.
6692311 6693520 He's the One.
6709494 6711705 Do you believe it now, Trinity?
6714583 6715751 Morpheus...
6717419 6718503 The Oracle.
6719755 6722132 - She told me...<br />- She told you...
6722507 6724092 ...what you needed to hear.
6724384 6725719 That's all.
6726762 6729723 Sooner or later you'll realize,<br />just as I did...
6730057 6732351 ...there's a difference<br />between knowing the path...
6733101 6734394 ...and walking the path.
6737439 6738649 -Operator.<br />MORPHEUS: <i>Tank.</i>
6739566 6742110 - It's good to hear your voice.<br /><i>- We need an exit.</i>
6742361 6745155 Got one ready. Subway station,<br />State and Nalboa.
6758210 6760629 - Damn it!<br />- The trace was completed.
6760879 6764466 - We have their position.<br />- Sentinels are standing by.
6766176 6767678 Order the strike.

6787406 6788740 You first, Morpheus.
6809428 6811722 Neo, I want to tell you something...
6814975 6818937 ...but I'm afraid of<br />what it could mean if I do.

6822524 6825819 Everything the Oracle<br />told me has come true.

6857559 6858727 Neo!
6858977 6860604 -What happened?<br />TRINITY: An agent.
6860854 6862773 - Send me back.<br />- I can't.

6868987 6870364 Run, Neo. Run.
6875660 6877287 What is he doing?
6877537 6878789 He's beginning to believe.
6905774 6907150 You're empty.
6907734 6909027 So are you.
6942185 6945188 I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
6946314 6947357 ...Mr. Anderson.
6988315 6990400 Jesus, he's killing him.
7076570 7078697 You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
7079447 7082450 That is the sound of inevitability.
7085036 7088373 It is the sound of your death.
7089291 7091626 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7091876 7093503 My name...
7096506 7098550 ...is Neo.

7151144 7153396 - How long?<br />- Five, maybe six minutes.
7155440 7157609 Tank, charge the EMP.
7157859 7160904 -We can't use that until he's out.<br />MORPHEUS: I know. Don't worry.
7162072 7163156 He's gonna make it.
7163406 7165283 Flat or pumps? No, just...
7165533 7168411 What the shit? That's my phone!
7168828 7170413 That guy took my phone!
7172791 7175085 Got him!<br />He's on the run.

7435929 7436971 Neo...
7438431 7440391 I'm not afraid anymore.
7442018 7443353 The Oracle told me...
7443519 7448942 ...I'd fall in love, and that<br />the man I loved would be the One.
7452070 7454030 So you see...
7454739 7456741 ...you can't be dead.
7458326 7460161 You can't be...
