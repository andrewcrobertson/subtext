50342 53761 <i>- Is everything in place?<br />- You weren't suppose to relieve me.</i>
54012 56639 <i>I know, but I felt like taking a shift.</i>
57178 59708 <i>You like him, don't you?<br />You like watching him.</i>
59808 62948 <i>- Don't be ridiculous.<br />- We're gonna kill him. You understand that?</i>
63063 65522 <i>Morpheus believes he is the One.</i>
65690 66732 <i>Do you?</i>
66900 68734 <i>It doesn't matter what I believe.</i>
68985 70611 <i>You don't, do you?</i>
70862 72947 <i>- Did you hear that?<br />- Hear what?</i>
73156 74782 <i>Are you sure this line is clean?</i>
75033 77034 <i>Yeah, of course I'm sure.</i>
77369 78827 <i>I better go.</i>
116783 118575 - Freeze! Police!<br />- Hands on your head!
119119 120202 Do it! Do it now!
141599 144226 - Lieutenant.<br />- Oh, shit.
145061 148272 Lieutenant, you were given<br />specific orders.
148523 150232 I'm just doing my job.
150859 155279 You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"<br />crap, you can cram it up your ass.
155739 158240 The orders were for your protection.
159743 161952 I think we can handle one little girl.
167083 168834 I sent two units!
169085 170669 They're bringing her down now!
170920 174048 No, lieutenant, your men<br />are already dead.
203119 204203 Shit.
207123 209208 Morpheus, the line was traced.<br />I don't know how.
209459 211085 <i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>
211294 213575 <i>There's no time.<br />You're gonna have to get to another exit.</i>
213713 216131 - Are there any agents?<br />- Yes.
216341 217508 Goddamn it.
217759 219301 <i>You have to focus, Trinity.</i>
219552 221929 <i>There's a phone at Wells and Lake.</i>
222305 223972 <i>You can make it.</i>
224224 225891 - All right.<br /><i>- Go.</i>
288037 289079 That's impossible.
324073 326074 Get up, Trinity. Just get up.
326743 327951 Get up.
373831 375332 She got out.
375625 376917 It doesn't matter.
377168 380337 - The informant is real.<br />- Yes.
380505 382256 We have the name of their next target.
382507 384174 The name is Neo.
387470 388971 We'll need a search running.
389264 391181 It has already begun.
445945 447154 What?
452910 454411 What the hell?
462045 464004 "Follow the white rabbit."
475850 477017 Who is it?
477268 478560 It's Choi.
483691 485525 Yeah. Yeah.
492075 493241 You're two hours late.
493826 495577 I know. It's her fault.
495745 496828 You got the money?
498956 500123 Two grand.
501000 502125 Hold on.
519811 521186 Hallelujah.
521428 522928 You're my savior, man.
523448 526068 - My own personal Jesus Christ.<br />- You get caught using that...
526188 529148 Yeah, I know. This never happened.<br />You don't exist.
529946 532030 - Right.<br />- Something wrong, man?
532281 534324 You look a little whiter than usual.
535451 537619 My computer, it...
540618 545548 You ever have that feeling where you're<br />not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
545748 548848 All the time.<br />It's called mescaline.
549215 551341 It's the only way to fly.
552318 554958 Look, it just sounds to me like,<br />you know, you need to unplug, man.
555471 557472 You know, get some R and R?
557890 561643 What do you think, Dujour?<br />Should we take him with us?
563646 564855 Definitely.
565106 568191 No, I can't. I have work tomorrow.
568818 569943 Come on.
570194 572821 It'll be fun. I promise.
579328 580829 Yeah.
581664 583498 Sure. I'll go.
611110 612194 Hello, Neo.
613529 614696 How do you know that name?
615531 617240 I know a lot about you.
618117 620202 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
621162 622370 Trinity.
623998 625165 The Trinity?
625625 627334 That cracked the lRS D-base?
627585 629044 That was a long time ago.
629295 631213 - Jesus.<br />- What?
631672 633465 I just thought...
635218 636384 you were a guy.
636636 638094 Most guys do.
639305 641515 That was you on my computer.
642141 643225 How did you do that?
643893 646603 Right now, all I can tell you...
647230 648772 is that you're in danger.
649232 651650 - I brought you here to warn you.<br />- Of what?
652235 653902 They're watching you, Neo.
654487 656905 - Who is?<br />- Please just listen.
660409 662244 I know why you're here, Neo.
663037 664996 I know what you've been doing.
665248 667123 I know why you hardly sleep...
667416 670544 why you live alone and why,<br />night after night...
670795 673129 you sit at your computer.
674298 675841 You're looking for him.
676634 679636 I know, because I was once<br />looking for the same thing.
680137 682264 And when he found me...
682890 685976 he told me I wasn't really<br />looking for him...
686894 688645 I was looking for an answer.
689272 692399 It's the question that drives us, Neo.
693067 695735 It's the question<br />that brought you here.
697822 699197 You know the question...
699448 700949 just as I did.
702493 704119 What is the Matrix?
704370 706830 The answer is out there, Neo.
707498 709499 It's looking for you.
710293 711960 And it will find you...
712253 714254 if you want it to.
720970 722012 Shit.
722179 723388 Shit, shit.
733649 736484 You have a problem with authority,<br />Mr. Anderson.
736736 740780 You believe that you are special,<br />that the rules do not apply to you.
741490 743491 Obviously, you are mistaken.
746454 749331 This is one of the top<br />software companies in the world...
749582 752959 because employees understand<br />they are part of a whole.
753210 757839 Thus, if an employee has a problem,<br />the company has a problem.
760092 763303 The time has come to make<br />a choice, Mr. Anderson.
764180 768058 Either you choose to be at your desk<br />on time from this day forth...
768684 771269 or you choose to find another job.
772146 773480 Do I make myself clear?
773731 776149 Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.<br />Perfectly clear.
784283 785492 Thomas Anderson?
787745 789162 Yeah, that's me.
789956 791164 Okay.
797171 798338 Great.
799757 800924 Have a nice day.
816399 817440 Hello?
817733 821069 <i>Hello, Neo. Do you know who this is?</i>
823322 825073 - Morpheus.<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
825324 827325 <i>I've been looking for you.</i>
827576 830745 <i>I don't know if you're ready to see<br />what I want to show you.</i>
830997 834165 <i>But unfortunately, you and l<br />have run out of time.</i>
834417 838128 <i>They're coming for you, and I don't know<br />what they're going to do.</i>
838379 839713 Who's coming for me?
839964 842048 <i>Stand up and see for yourself.</i>
842299 843800 What? Right now?
844093 846594 <i>Yes. Now.</i>
847471 849347 <i>Do it slowly.</i>
849765 850974 <i>The elevator.</i>
855855 857647 - Oh, shit!<br /><i>- Yes.</i>
862319 863403 What do they want?
863571 864393 <i>I don't know.</i>
864417 866906 <i>If you don't want<br />to find out, get out of there.</i>
867074 868116 How?
868325 871494 <i>I can guide you,<br />but you must do exactly as I say.</i>
871704 874372 - Okay.<br /><i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>
877501 879627 - But what if the y--<br /><i>- Go. Now.</i>
886385 888762 <i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>
895978 898730 <i>When I tell you,<br />go to the end of the row...</i>
898981 900940 <i>to the office<br />at the end of the hall.</i>
901192 903568 <i>Stay as low as you can.</i>
905863 906988 <i>Go. Now.</i>
921378 924923 <i>Good. Now, outside there is a scaffold.</i>
927635 929969 - How do you know this?<br /><i>- We don't have time.</i>
930221 933056 <i>To your left there's a window.<br />Go to it.</i>
935309 936851 <i>Open it.</i>
937686 939479 <i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>
939730 942315 No way! No way!<br />This is crazy!
942566 944943 <i>There are two ways<br />out of this building.</i>
945194 948988 <i>One is that scaffold.<br />The other is in their custody.</i>
949240 952450 <i>You take a chance either way.<br />I leave it to you.</i>
956038 957789 This is insane!
958958 960834 Why is this happening to me?
961127 962752 What'd I do?
963129 965880 I'm nobody.<br />I didn't do anything.
966465 967924 I'm gonna die.
977726 978768 Shit!
999039 1000165 Oh, shit!
1005129 1006921 I can't do this.
1019560 1020602 Shit.
1069860 1074697 As you can see, we've had our eye on<br />you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
1075991 1078660 It seems that you've been living...
1078911 1081037 two lives.
1082456 1084958 In one life,<br />you're Thomas A. Anderson...
1085209 1088544 program writer for<br />a respectable software company.
1089588 1092882 You have a social security number.<br />You pay your taxes.
1093342 1094592 And you...
1096178 1099806 help your landlady<br />carry out her garbage.
1102309 1105436 The other life is lived in computers...
1105729 1108690 where you go by<br />the hacker alias "Neo"...
1108941 1113736 and are guilty of virtually every<br />computer crime we have a law for.
1115030 1116990 One of these lives...
1117241 1119075 has a future.
1119410 1121411 And one of them does not.
1125124 1128960 I'm going to be as forthcoming<br />as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
1129962 1131296 You're here...
1131630 1133881 because we need your help.
1137511 1140513 We know that you've been contacted<br />by a certain...
1140764 1142557 individual.
1143475 1147520 A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
1148522 1152525 Whatever you think you know<br />about this man is irrelevant.
1152776 1155194 He is considered by many authorities...
1155446 1158489 to be the most dangerous man alive.
1161201 1162410 My colleagues...
1162870 1165788 believe that I am wasting<br />my time with you.
1166081 1169500 But I believe you wish<br />to do the right thing.
1169793 1173296 We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
1173672 1175798 give you a fresh start.
1176300 1179218 All we're asking in return<br />is your cooperation...
1179470 1182972 in bringing<br />a known terrorist to justice.
1184350 1185600 Yeah.
1186894 1188978 That sounds like a really good deal.
1190606 1192357 But I got a better one.
1192608 1194108 How about...
1194526 1196527 I give you the finger...
1199114 1201115 and you give me my phone call.
1203327 1205161 Mr. Anderson...
1209333 1210375 you disappoint me.
1210626 1213252 You can't scare me<br />with this Gestapo crap.
1213504 1214879 I know my rights.
1215130 1216631 I want my phone call.
1217216 1219384 Tell me, Mr. Anderson...
1220260 1221677 what good is a phone call...
1221929 1225515 if you're unable to speak?
1259299 1261509 You're going to help us,<br />Mr. Anderson...
1262010 1264178 whether you want to or not.
1322613 1325865 <i>This line is tapped,<br />so I must be brief.</i>
1326116 1330411 <i>They got to you first, but they've<br />underestimated how important you are.</i>
1330662 1332497 <i>If they knew what I know...</i>
1332748 1334749 <i>you would probably be dead.</i>
1335751 1339462 What are you talking about?<br />What is happening to me?
1339713 1344550 <i>You are the One, Neo. You may have<br />spent the last few years...</i>
1344801 1347762 <i>looking for me, but I've spent<br />my entire life...</i>
1348013 1349514 <i>looking for you.</i>
1351058 1353226 <i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>
1354186 1357063 - Yes.<br /><i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>
1367282 1368491 Get in.
1380546 1381587 What's this?
1381838 1384382 It's necessary, Neo.<br />For our protection.
1384633 1386801 - From what?<br />- From you.
1388345 1389804 - Take off your shirt.<br />- What?
1389972 1391138 Stop the car.
1395727 1396894 Listen, coppertop.
1397145 1399146 We don't have time for 20 Questions.
1399648 1402024 Right now, there's only one rule:
1402317 1403651 Our way...
1403986 1405069 or the highway.
1411618 1412702 Fine.
1414580 1417039 Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
1417624 1420251 - Why?<br />- Because you have been down there.
1421003 1422211 You know that road.
1423213 1424839 You know exactly where it ends.
1427050 1429302 And I know that's<br />not where you want to be.
1443483 1445026 Apoc, lights.
1447529 1449697 Lie back.<br />Lift up your shirt.
1451768 1454168 - What is that thing?<br />- Think you're bugged.
1461627 1463085 Try and relax.
1469384 1472637 Come on.
1474389 1475389 It's on the move.
1477184 1478392 Come on, you shit.
1480228 1482480 - You're gonna lose it.<br />- No, I'm not.
1482648 1483731 Clear!
1492324 1494450 Jesus Christ!<br />That thing's real!?
1528193 1529527 This is it.
1532864 1535324 Let me give you one piece of advice.
1536284 1537952 Be honest.
1539538 1541747 He knows more than you can imagine.
1550465 1551799 At last.
1553343 1554427 Welcome, Neo.
1555637 1557555 As you no doubt have guessed...
1557806 1559056 I am Morpheus.
1560100 1561684 It's an honor to meet you.
1562144 1563185 No...
1563770 1565062 the honor is mine.
1565981 1568482 Please, come. Sit.
1583582 1585207 I imagine...
1585625 1588377 that right now you're feeling<br />a bit like Alice...
1590088 1592506 tumbling down the rabbit hole?
1593341 1594425 You could say that.
1595343 1597970 I can see it in your eyes.
1598555 1601849 You have the look of a man<br />who accepts what he sees...
1602100 1604351 because he's expecting to wake up.
1605771 1608355 Ironically, this is not<br />far from the truth.
1609065 1611442 Do you believe in fate, Neo?
1611610 1612693 No.
1613111 1614153 Why not?
1614404 1617198 I don't like the idea that<br />I'm not in control of my life.
1618283 1621619 I know exactly what you mean.
1625916 1628292 Let me tell you why you're here.
1629336 1630878 You know something.
1631421 1633047 What you know,<br />you can't explain.
1633548 1635132 But you feel it.
1635717 1637635 You felt it your entire life:
1638220 1642389 Something's wrong with the world.<br />You don't know what, but it's there.
1642891 1645100 Like a splinter in your mind...
1645352 1647228 driving you mad.
1648146 1650898 It is this feeling<br />that has brought you to me.
1653443 1655277 Do you know what<br />I'm talking about?
1657113 1658447 The Matrix?
1660951 1662618 Do you want to know...
1663078 1665079 what it is?
1667457 1669333 The Matrix is everywhere.
1669584 1671293 It is all around us.
1671545 1673504 Even now, in this very room.
1674339 1676549 You can see it when you<br />look out your window...
1676800 1679134 or when you turn on your television.
1679553 1682096 You can feel it when you go to work...
1683640 1685307 when you go to church...
1685725 1687810 when you pay your taxes.
1688937 1691856 It is the world that has been<br />pulled over your eyes...
1692107 1693691 to blind you from the truth.
1695902 1697152 What truth?
1701408 1702950 That you are a slave.
1704452 1706745 Like everyone else,<br />you were born into bondage...
1706997 1711667 born into a prison that you cannot<br />smell or taste or touch.
1711960 1713252 A prison...
1713503 1714628 for your mind.
1721636 1723971 Unfortunately, no one can be...
1724306 1726682 told what the Matrix is.
1730145 1732021 You have to see it for yourself.
1741531 1743824 This is your last chance.
1744075 1746410 After this, there is no turning back.
1746870 1748329 You take the blue pill...
1748663 1751707 the story ends, you wake up<br />in your bed and believe...
1751958 1753751 whatever you want to believe.
1754002 1755336 You take the red pill...
1755587 1757546 you stay in Wonderland...
1758048 1760758 and I show you how deep<br />the rabbit hole goes.
1770644 1771852 Remember...
1772687 1775731 all I'm offering is the truth.<br />Nothing more.
1790038 1791372 Follow me.
1793917 1795584 Apoc, are we on-line?
1795835 1797211 Almost.
1800548 1802591 Time is always against us.
1802968 1804468 Please take a seat there.
1822654 1824363 You did all this?
1828493 1830494 The pill you took is<br />part of a trace program.
1831246 1835874 It disrupts your carrier signals<br />so we can pinpoint your location.
1836418 1837459 What does that mean?
1838044 1840212 It means buckle your<br />seat belt, Dorothy...
1840547 1841880 because Kansas...
1842132 1843173 is going bye-bye.
1881087 1882463 Did you ...?
1893475 1897561 Have you ever had a dream, Neo,<br />that you were so sure was real?
1899022 1901607 What if you were unable<br />to wake from that dream?
1901858 1904359 How would you know the difference<br />between the dream world...
1904986 1906403 and the real world?
1908031 1909198 This can't be.
1909365 1910407 Be what?
1911117 1912618 Be real?
1916581 1917998 - Going into replication.<br />- Apoc?
1918208 1919208 Still nothing.
1919793 1921001 It's cold.
1921252 1922628 It's cold!
1926508 1928175 Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
1929677 1932346 - I got a fibrillation.<br />- Apoc, location.
1932597 1934056 Targeting almost there.
1937352 1938769 He's going into arrest.
1939020 1941522 - Lock. I got him!<br />- Now, Tank, now!
2118783 2119866 Welcome...
2120201 2122119 to the real world.
2123538 2125372 We've done it, Trinity.
2125623 2127165 We found him.
2127417 2130210 - I hope you're right.<br />- You don't have to hope.
2130795 2132379 I know it.
2137552 2138593 Am I dead?
2139095 2141263 Far from it.
2155236 2156653 He still needs a lot of work.
2158197 2159281 What are you doing?
2159532 2161742 Your muscles atrophied.<br />We're rebuilding them.
2162327 2163869 Why do my eyes hurt?
2164579 2166455 You've never used them before.
2170209 2171251 Rest, Neo.
2171502 2173170 The answers are coming.
2247745 2249329 Morpheus, what's happened to me?
2249956 2251039 What is this place?
2251290 2253959 More important than "what" is "when."
2254460 2255502 "When"?
2255711 2257754 You believe it's the year 1999...
2258005 2260257 when in fact, it's closer to 2199.
2261384 2264136 I can't tell you exactly<br />what year it is...
2264387 2266012 because we honestly don't know.
2266514 2269349 There's nothing I can say<br />that will explain it for you.
2269600 2272352 Come with me.<br />See for yourself.
2272895 2274646 This is my ship.
2274939 2277858 The <i>Nebuchadnezzar</i>.<br />It's a hovercraft.
2280695 2282446 This is the main deck.
2288202 2289453 This is the core...
2291956 2295709 where we broadcast our pirate signal<br />and hack into the Matrix.
2299088 2302257 Most of my crew you already know.
2307263 2308680 This is Apoc...
2309474 2310807 Switch...
2312393 2313560 - and Cypher.<br />- Hi.
2313811 2317522 The ones you don't know:<br />Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
2318399 2320817 The little one behind you is Mouse.
2325156 2328408 You wanted to know<br />what the Matrix is?
2329452 2330660 Trinity.
2351682 2353266 Try to relax.
2358147 2359981 This will feel a little weird.
2371953 2373328 This...
2373496 2375205 is the Construct.
2375623 2377749 It's our loading program.
2378000 2380460 We can load anything, from clothing...
2380711 2382087 to equipment...
2382380 2383713 weapons...
2384340 2386174 training simulations...
2386551 2389094 anything we need.
2391889 2394307 Right now we're inside<br />a computer program?
2394600 2396518 Is it really so hard to believe?
2397019 2399646 Your clothes are different.<br />The plugs in your body are gone.
2400856 2402941 Your hair has changed.
2403317 2406653 Your appearance now is what we call<br />"residual self-image."
2407363 2409990 It is the mental projection<br />of your digital self.
2415871 2416997 This isn't real?
2417248 2418790 What is "real"?
2419166 2421418 How do you define "real"?
2421711 2423628 If you're talking about<br />what you can feel...
2423879 2426298 what you can smell, taste and see...
2426549 2430427 then "real" is simply electrical<br />signals interpreted by your brain.
2434599 2437017 This is the world that you know.
2438436 2441479 The world as it was at the end<br />of the 20th century.
2443858 2448194 It exists now only as part of<br />a neural-interactive simulation...
2448446 2449696 that we call the Matrix.
2454243 2457037 You've been living<br />in a dream world, Neo.
2458039 2459164 This is the world...
2459457 2461207 as it exists today.
2474263 2477223 Welcome to "the desert...
2478100 2479684 of the real."
2483064 2485440 We have only bits and pieces<br />of information.
2485688 2489744 But what we know for certain is that at<br />some point in the early 21st century...
2489768 2492989 all of mankind was united<br />in celebration.
2493240 2497994 We marveled at our own magnificence<br />as we gave birth to AI.
2498788 2499913 Al.
2500956 2502332 You mean artificial intelligence.
2502583 2507003 A singular consciousness that spawned<br />an entire race of machines.
2507838 2511299 We don't know who struck first,<br />us or them.
2511717 2514928 But we know that it was us<br />that scorched the sky.
2516588 2518968 At the time, they were<br />dependent on solar power...
2519016 2522352 and it was believed that<br />they would be unable to survive...
2522687 2526189 without an energy source<br />as abundant as the sun.
2526440 2531319 Throughout human history, we have<br />been dependent on machines to survive.
2532780 2536991 Fate, it seems, is not<br />without a sense of irony.
2540204 2544624 The human body generates more<br />bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
2544875 2549003 And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
2550923 2553091 Combined with a form of fusion...
2553426 2558263 the machines had found all the energy<br />they would ever need.
2562309 2566062 There are fields, Neo,<br />endless fields...
2566313 2569566 where human beings<br />are no longer born.
2570276 2572110 We are grown.
2578159 2580744 For the longest time,<br />I wouldn't believe it.
2580995 2583663 And then I saw the fields<br />with my own eyes...
2584999 2586624 watched them liquefy the dead...
2586876 2590211 so they could be fed intravenously<br />to the living.
2590755 2595008 And standing there,<br />facing the pure, horrifying precision...
2595259 2598178 I came to realize<br />the obviousness of the truth.
2600806 2602599 What is the Matrix?
2603809 2604851 Control.
2606228 2609606 The Matrix is a computer-generated<br />dream world...
2610399 2613485 built to keep us under control...
2614653 2617822 in order to change a human being...
2618449 2619616 into this.
2620993 2622118 No.
2623746 2625330 I don't believe it.
2625706 2626915 It's not possible.
2627500 2632086 I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.<br />I just said it would be the truth.
2632338 2633630 Stop!
2634173 2635381 Let me out!
2636091 2638009 Let me out! I want out!
2639970 2642639 - Easy, Neo. Easy.<br />- Get this thing out of me.
2642890 2644557 Get this thing out of me!
2646352 2647852 Don't touch me!
2648103 2649729 Stay away from me!
2650147 2655318 I don't believe it.
2655569 2657612 - He's gonna pop.<br />- Breathe, Neo.
2657988 2659072 Just breathe.
2677466 2679259 I can't go back, can I?
2680094 2681511 No.
2682346 2683555 But if you could...
2684390 2685890 would you really want to?
2688394 2689769 I owe you an apology.
2690354 2691729 We have a rule.
2692189 2695441 We never free a mind<br />once it's reached a certain age.
2695609 2696693 It's dangerous.
2697403 2699112 The mind has trouble letting go.
2699363 2701656 I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
2702700 2704784 I did what I did because...
2705494 2706953 I had to.
2715379 2719465 When the Matrix was first built,<br />there was a man born inside...
2719967 2723761 who had the ability<br />to change whatever he wanted...
2724138 2727056 to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
2728809 2732270 It was he who freed the first of us...
2733147 2734772 taught us the truth.
2736233 2739319 As long as the Matrix exists...
2739653 2741738 the human race will never be free.
2745951 2747493 After he died...
2748245 2750955 the Oracle prophesied his return...
2751498 2754709 and that his coming would hail<br />the destruction of the Matrix...
2754960 2756628 end the war...
2756962 2758242 bring freedom to our people.
2759548 2764177 That is why there are those of us who<br />spent our lives searching the Matrix...
2764511 2766095 looking for him.
2768515 2770600 I did what I did because...
2772227 2774354 I believe that search is over.
2779443 2780860 Get some rest.
2781487 2783279 You're going to need it.
2785991 2787033 For what?
2790079 2791287 Your training.
2809598 2811307 Morning. Did you sleep?
2812184 2813393 You will tonight.
2813769 2815311 I guarantee it.
2816814 2818731 I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
2819191 2821609 - You don't have any --<br />- Holes? Nope.
2822528 2824204 Me and my brother, Dozer...
2824228 2827467 we're both 100% pure,<br />old-fashioned, homegrown human.
2827491 2828700 Born free right here...
2829243 2830576 in the real world.
2830828 2832495 Genuine child of Zion.
2833330 2835790 - Zion?<br />- If the war was over tomorrow...
2836041 2837542 Zion's where the party would be.
2837960 2839252 It's a city?
2839503 2842672 The last human city.<br />The only place we have left.
2844258 2845508 Where is it?
2847261 2850680 Deep underground near the Earth's core,<br />where it's still warm.
2852307 2854183 You live long enough,<br />you might see it.
2856437 2861274 Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited<br />to see what you're capable of...
2861525 2863276 if Morpheus is right and all.
2863777 2866529 We're not supposed to<br />talk about this, but...
2866780 2868197 if you are...
2869283 2871284 it's a very exciting time.
2872327 2875038 We got a lot to do.<br />We gotta get to it.
2878959 2881878 We're supposed to start<br />with these programs first.
2882880 2886340 That's major boring shit.<br />Let's do something more fun.
2886675 2888134 How about...
2889720 2891471 combat training?
2897519 2898978 "Jujitsu"?
2899855 2901522 I'm going to learn jujitsu?
2912868 2914077 Holy shit!
2914328 2916662 "Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
2916997 2918289 How about some more?
2918540 2919832 Hell, yes.
2921919 2922960 Hell, yeah.
2935140 2936224 How is he?
2936475 2938643 Ten hours straight.<br />He's a machine.
2949863 2951239 I know kung fu.
2952908 2953908 Show me.
2955702 2957453 This is a sparring program...
2957704 2960498 similar to the programmed reality<br />of the Matrix.
2960749 2963084 It has the same basic rules.<br />Like gravity.
2963335 2966796 These rules are no different<br />than those of a computer system.
2967339 2968840 Some of them can be bent.
2969049 2971509 Others can be broken.
2972052 2973136 Understand?
2974221 2975263 Then hit me...
2975848 2976973 if you can.
3015971 3017013 Good!
3017764 3018931 Adaptation.
3019224 3020433 Improvisation.
3020726 3022059 But your weakness...
3022311 3023686 is not your technique.
3030652 3032737 Morpheus is fighting Neo.
3105018 3106185 How did I beat you?
3112776 3113859 You're too fast.
3114403 3115736 Do you believe that...
3116113 3118614 my being stronger or faster...
3118865 3122535 has anything to do<br />with my muscles in this place?
3126581 3128374 You think you're breathing air?
3141888 3143097 Again!
3154568 3156986 Jesus Christ, he's fast!
3157237 3159447 His neuro-kinetics<br />are way above normal.
3164911 3166370 What are you waiting for?
3166621 3168581 You're faster than this.
3170792 3173002 Don't think you are.
3173253 3174920 Know you are.
3185307 3188100 Come on! Stop trying to hit me,<br />and hit me!
3198028 3199779 I don't believe it.
3201323 3203449 I know what you're trying to do.
3205118 3207286 I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
3207621 3209705 But I can only show you the door.
3210290 3212124 You have to walk through it.
3214503 3216629 Tank, load the jump program.
3228225 3230935 You have to let it all go, Neo.<br />Fear...
3231478 3233646 doubt and disbelief.
3234815 3237525 Free your mind.
3253708 3255418 Okey-dokey.
3257504 3258671 Free my mind.
3259131 3260256 What if he makes it?
3260507 3263217 - No one's ever made their first jump.<br />- I know.
3264553 3267012 - But what if he does?<br />- He won't.
3267597 3268681 Come on.
3268932 3270099 All right.
3270559 3272601 No problem. Free my mind.
3273395 3276188 Free my mind. No problem. Right.
3295584 3297251 What does that mean?
3297627 3299462 It doesn't mean anything.
3300046 3302631 Everybody falls the first time.
3303091 3304383 Right, Trin?
3325071 3327698 - I thought it wasn't real.<br />- Your mind makes it real.
3330952 3333204 If you're killed in the Matrix...
3333371 3334413 you die here?
3335040 3337500 The body cannot live without the mind.
3367989 3371367 I don't remember you ever<br />bringing me dinner.
3374454 3377289 There is something about him,<br />isn't there?
3377916 3379542 Don't tell me you're a believer now?
3380544 3381752 I keep wondering...
3381788 3385673 if Morpheus is so sure, why<br />doesn't he take him to see the Oracle?
3386591 3389510 Morpheus will take him<br />when he's ready.
3399312 3400854 The Matrix is a system, Neo.
3402607 3403899 That system is our enemy.
3404108 3407088 When you're inside, you look<br />around, what do you see?
3407112 3410906 Businessmen, teachers,<br />lawyers, carpenters.
3411366 3413951 The very minds of the people<br />we are trying to save.
3414202 3417688 But until we do, these people are<br />still a part of that system...
3417728 3419458 and that makes them our enemy.
3419499 3420918 You have to understand...
3421068 3424288 most of these people are not<br />ready to be unplugged.
3424546 3426130 And many of them are so inert...
3426381 3428799 so hopelessly dependent<br />on the system...
3429050 3431760 that they will fight to protect it.
3433258 3435028 Were you listening to me, Neo?
3435228 3437028 Or looking at the woman in the red dress?
3437183 3438934 - I was...<br />- Look again.
3440186 3441270 Freeze it.
3445608 3446858 This...
3447902 3449528 - This isn't the Matrix?<br />- No.
3451323 3455159 It's another training program<br />designed to teach you one thing:
3455785 3458203 If you are not one of us,<br />you are one of them.
3458747 3461540 - What are they?<br />- Sentient programs.
3462292 3466587 They can move in and out of any<br />software still hardwired to their system.
3466963 3470341 That means that anyone<br />we haven't unplugged...
3470675 3472009 is potentially an agent.
3472969 3474803 Inside the Matrix...
3475388 3477097 they are everyone...
3477432 3479141 and they are no one.
3479392 3482519 We have survived by hiding from<br />them, by running from them...
3482771 3484396 but they are the gatekeepers.
3484648 3487364 They are guarding all the doors.<br />They are holding all the keys.
3487388 3490694 Which means that sooner or later,<br />someone is going to have to fight them.
3490862 3492071 Someone?
3492405 3493822 I won't lie to you, Neo.
3494278 3496628 Every single man or woman<br />who has stood their ground...
3496668 3498828 everyone who has fought an agent has died.
3499371 3501747 But where they have failed,<br />you will succeed.
3501915 3502998 Why?
3503249 3505542 I've seen an agent punch<br />through a concrete wall.
3505794 3509380 Men have emptied entire clips at them<br />and hit nothing but air.
3509628 3512944 Yet their strength and their speed<br />are still based in a world...
3512968 3514374 that is built on rules.
3514398 3515636 Because of that...
3515887 3519264 they will never be as strong<br />or as fast as you can be.
3523561 3525437 What are you telling me?
3526147 3527606 That I can dodge bullets?
3529609 3530984 No, Neo.
3531486 3534405 I'm trying to tell you<br />that when you're ready...
3535281 3536615 you won't have to.
3540745 3541954 <i>We got trouble.</i>
3560890 3563350 - Did Zion send the warning?<br />- No, another ship.
3566604 3567896 Shit.
3568148 3571024 - Squiddy's sweeping in quick.<br />- Squiddy?
3571234 3574445 A sentinel. A killing machine<br />designed for one thing.
3574696 3575904 Search and destroy.
3577238 3579028 Set her down right over there.
3599679 3601180 How are we doing, Tank?
3609898 3611064 Power off-line.
3611566 3613525 EMP armed...
3614068 3615611 - and ready.<br />- EMP?
3615904 3617780 Electromagnetic pulse.
3618031 3620908 Disables any electrical system<br />in the blast radius.
3621075 3623368 It's the only weapon we have<br />against the machines.
3629167 3632294 - Where are we?<br />- Their old service and waste systems.
3633546 3634671 Sewers.
3634881 3637591 There used to be cities<br />that spanned hundreds of miles.
3638088 3640148 Now these sewers are<br />all that's left of them.
3640261 3641595 Quiet.
3682178 3683637 Neo.
3685473 3687641 You scared the bejesus out of me.
3688726 3690644 - Sorry.<br />- It's okay.
3693147 3694398 Is that ...?
3694649 3696233 The Matrix?
3696401 3697609 Yeah.
3699404 3702573 - Do you always look at it encoded?<br />- Well, you have to.
3702824 3705909 The image translators work<br />for the construct program.
3706160 3709580 But there's way too much information<br />to decode the Matrix.
3709831 3712791 You get used to it.<br />I don't even see the code.
3713038 3716048 All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
3716728 3718648 Hey, do you...
3719299 3720382 want a drink?
3720633 3721675 Sure.
3725221 3726680 You know...
3727599 3729141 I know what you're thinking.
3729392 3731476 Because right now I'm thinking<br />the same thing.
3731811 3735147 Actually, I've been thinking it<br />ever since I got here.
3737066 3740068 Why, oh, why didn't I take<br />the blue pill?
3752457 3754374 Good shit, huh?
3754709 3755918 Dozer makes it.
3756377 3757544 It's good for two things:
3757795 3760881 Degreasing engines and<br />killing brain cells.
3761883 3764092 So can I ask you something?
3767096 3768722 Did he tell you why he did it?
3771351 3773185 Why you're here?
3776856 3778607 Jesus!
3779817 3781735 What a mind job.
3783154 3785948 So you're here to save the world.
3787450 3789534 What do you say<br />to something like that?
3794707 3796083 A little piece of advice.
3797877 3799294 You see an agent...
3799629 3801922 you do what we do:
3802256 3803799 Run.
3804133 3805884 You run your ass off.
3813142 3814851 Thanks for the drink.
3819565 3820732 Sweet dreams.
3824737 3828156 Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
3828825 3829950 You know...
3831369 3833829 I know this steak doesn't exist.
3834831 3837582 I know that when I put it<br />in my mouth...
3837834 3840919 the Matrix is telling my brain<br />that it is...
3841212 3842337 juicy...
3842630 3844339 and delicious.
3847260 3848510 After nine years...
3849554 3851096 you know what I realize?
3858938 3860147 Ignorance is bliss.
3865194 3867029 Then we have a deal.
3869532 3871450 I don't want to remember nothing.
3871701 3874202 Nothing. You understand?
3878082 3880083 And I want to be rich.
3881419 3884129 You know, someone important.
3885631 3886757 Like an actor.
3887967 3891094 Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
3893264 3894806 Okay.
3895183 3897601 You get my body<br />back in a power plant...
3897977 3899728 reinsert me into the Matrix...
3900063 3901480 I'll get you what you want.
3901731 3903732 Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
3903983 3906151 No. I told you, I don't know them.
3909113 3911114 I can get you the man who does.
3911866 3913658 Morpheus.
3923753 3927214 Here you go, buddy.<br />Breakfast of champions.
3928549 3931343 If you close your eyes, it almost<br />feels like you're eating runny eggs.
3931552 3933261 Or a bowl of snot.
3933805 3935388 You know what it really reminds me of?
3937225 3939559 Tastee Wheat. Did you<br />ever eat Tastee Wheat?
3940186 3941874 No, but technically,<br />neither did you.
3941898 3944189 That's exactly my point. Exactly.
3944440 3945816 Because you have to wonder now...
3946067 3949319 how do the machines really know<br />what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
3949570 3950987 Maybe they got it wrong.
3951239 3954449 Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat<br />tasted like, actually tasted like...
3954742 3956743 oatmeal or tuna fish.
3957118 3958844 That makes you wonder about<br />a lot of things though.
3958868 3960234 You take chicken, for example.
3960258 3962434 Maybe they couldn't figure out what<br />to make chicken taste like.
3962458 3964501 Which is why chicken tastes<br />like everything.
3964752 3967033 - And maybe they couldn't figure out...<br />- Shut up, Mouse.
3968172 3969631 It's a single-celled protein...
3969668 3972926 combined with synthetic aminos,<br />vitamins and minerals.
3973177 3974427 Everything the body needs.
3974679 3977556 It doesn't have everything<br />the body needs.
3980309 3983395 So, I understand that you've run<br />through the agent training program.
3984438 3986481 You know, I wrote that program.
3986774 3988066 Here it comes.
3988317 3990277 - What did you think of her?<br />- Of who?
3990653 3993697 The woman in the red dress.<br />I designed her.
3994031 3996783 She, um. Well, she doesn't<br />talk very much but...
3997028 3998588 but, if you'd like to meet her...
3998928 4001048 I can arrange a much more personal milieu.
4001247 4002622 The digital pimp hard at work.
4002874 4005125 Pay no attention to<br />these hypocrites, Neo.
4006419 4008253 To deny our own impulses...
4008504 4011631 is to deny the very thing<br />that makes us human.
4013551 4014926 Dozer, when you're done...
4015136 4016776 bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
4017305 4018638 We're going in.
4019348 4020765 I'm taking Neo to see her.
4024687 4025937 See who?
4026939 4028190 The Oracle.
4033696 4035238 Everyone please observe...
4035568 4038588 the "fasten seat belt" and "no<br />smoking" signs have been turned on.
4038784 4042162 Sit back and enjoy your flight.
4066604 4067604 We're in.
4083246 4084412 We'll be back in an hour.
4099178 4101179 Unbelievable...
4101430 4102764 isn't it?
4106352 4108186 - God!<br />- What?
4108854 4110230 I used to eat there.
4112483 4114109 Really good noodles.
4118906 4121408 I have these memories from my life.
4123869 4125537 None of them happened.
4126247 4127497 What does that mean?
4127748 4129958 That the Matrix cannot tell you<br />who you are.
4130876 4132085 But an oracle can?
4132545 4133753 That's different.
4138467 4139718 Did you go to her?
4141262 4142429 Yes.
4142930 4144306 What did she tell you?
4147560 4149060 She told me...
4150104 4151271 What?
4155067 4156401 We're here.
4156777 4159070 Neo, come with me.
4179050 4181468 So is this the same oracle<br />that made...
4181635 4182886 the prophecy?
4183137 4187474 Yes. She's very old. She's been<br />with us since the beginning.
4187933 4189934 - The beginning?<br />- Of the Resistance.
4192188 4194564 And she knows what? Everything?
4196609 4198526 She would say she knows enough.
4199653 4201446 And she's never wrong.
4203657 4206826 Try not to think of it<br />in terms of right and wrong.
4207161 4208745 She is a guide, Neo.
4209121 4210997 She can help you to find the path.
4211499 4212749 She helped you?
4213459 4214501 Yes.
4215252 4216586 What did she tell you?
4219048 4221257 That I would find the One.
4234397 4236523 I told you I can only<br />show you the door.
4237233 4239317 You have to walk through it.
4243114 4244197 Hello, Neo.
4244448 4246116 You're right on time.
4254041 4257836 Make yourself at home, Morpheus.<br />Neo, come with me.
4263509 4265093 These are the other Potentials.
4265344 4266886 You can wait here.
4307720 4310263 Do not try and bend the spoon.
4310639 4312765 That's impossible.
4313601 4317604 Instead, only try<br />to realize the truth.
4318147 4319522 What truth?
4319773 4321441 There is no spoon.
4324028 4325361 There is no spoon?
4325613 4330074 Then you'll see that it is not the spoon<br />that bends. It is only yourself.
4346133 4347592 The Oracle will you see now.
4358312 4359854 I know you're Neo.
4360481 4361648 Be right with you.
4362691 4365068 - You're the Oracle?<br />- Bingo.
4367780 4370657 Not quite what you<br />were expecting, right?
4371700 4373868 Almost done.
4376372 4377997 Smell good, don't they?
4379250 4380500 Yeah.
4380751 4382585 I'd ask you to sit down...
4382836 4385213 but you're not going to anyway.
4385714 4388591 - And don't worry about the vase.<br />- What vase?
4391720 4392887 That vase.
4393847 4394889 I'm sorry.
4395140 4397016 I said, don't worry about it.
4398185 4400144 I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
4400771 4401804 How did you know?
4401828 4403828 ..
4404024 4407819 What's really going to bake<br />your noodle later on is...
4408153 4411114 would you still have broken it<br />if I hadn't said anything?
4415911 4417829 You're cuter than I thought.
4420874 4423126 I can see why she likes you.
4424003 4425086 Who?
4425337 4427171 Not too bright, though.
4430467 4433553 You know why Morpheus<br />brought you to see me.
4435681 4436848 So...
4437808 4439183 what do you think?
4441020 4442770 Do you think you are the One?
4444728 4446108 Honestly, I don't know.
4449194 4450612 You know what that means?
4451447 4452614 It's Latin.
4452990 4455199 Means, "Know thyself."
4456660 4458620 I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
4460873 4464709 Being the One is just<br />like being in love.
4465419 4468296 No one can tell you you're in love.<br />You just know it...
4468547 4469672 through and through.
4470007 4472050 Balls to bones.
4474386 4475428 Well...
4477389 4479474 I'd better have a look at you.
4480809 4482310 Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
4496700 4498368 Okay...
4498994 4503956 Now I'm supposed to say,<br />"Hmm, that's interesting, but"...
4504458 4505583 Then you say:
4506251 4507460 But what?
4507711 4511673 But, you already know<br />what I'm going to tell you.
4513092 4516052 - I'm not the One.<br />- Sorry, kid.
4517680 4519681 You got the gift...
4520599 4522892 but it looks like<br />you're waiting for something.
4527564 4528606 What?
4528638 4531734 Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
4532319 4534570 That's the way these things go.
4535447 4538032 - What's funny?<br />- Morpheus.
4538688 4540028 He, uh...
4541495 4543204 He almost had me convinced.
4543455 4544580 I know.
4546125 4548251 Poor Morpheus.
4550629 4553756 Without him, we're lost.
4555300 4557468 What do you mean, "without him"?
4561473 4563391 Are you sure you want<br />to hear this?
4565602 4568354 Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
4570065 4572233 And no one, not you, not even me...
4572484 4574736 can convince him otherwise.
4575112 4577488 He believes it so blindly...
4577781 4582118 that he's going to sacrifice<br />his life to save yours.
4582327 4583494 What?
4583662 4586330 You're going to<br />have to make a choice.
4586957 4590543 In the one hand,<br />you'll have Morpheus' life.
4591044 4593921 And in the other hand,<br />you'll have your own.
4595340 4597633 One of you is going to die.
4599720 4603014 Which one will be up to you.
4604391 4606309 I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
4606560 4608227 You have a good soul.
4609313 4612023 And I hate giving<br />good people bad news.
4613328 4614578 Now...
4615148 4616548 Don't worry about it.
4616862 4619280 As soon as you<br />step outside that door...
4619531 4621657 you'll start feeling better.
4622367 4626162 You'll remember you don't believe<br />in any of this fate crap.
4626997 4629749 You're in control of your own life.
4630584 4631876 Remember?
4633545 4634754 Here...
4636632 4638174 take a cookie.
4638717 4642053 I promise, by the time<br />you're done eating it...
4643013 4645389 you'll feel right as rain.
4654608 4655942 What was said...
4656568 4658027 was for you...
4658570 4660404 and for you alone.
4683345 4684428 They're on the way.
4714251 4715293 What is that?
4730058 4731475 Oh, déjà vu.
4734980 4736063 What did you just say?
4736315 4737815 Nothing. Just had a little déjà vu.
4738066 4739692 - What did you see?<br />- What happened?
4741111 4743279 A black cat went past us...
4743530 4745370 and then another that looked just like it.
4745407 4746949 How much like it?<br />Was it the same cat?
4748168 4749624 It might have been. I'm not sure.
4749648 4751388 Switch, Apoc.
4755038 4756034 What is it?
4756058 4758124 A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix.
4758148 4760128 It happens when they change something.
4763928 4765428 Oh, my God.
4766720 4767720 Let's go.
4772976 4774769 They cut the hard line.<br />It's a trap! Get out!
4780233 4781484 Oh, no.
4821768 4824504 That's what they changed. We're<br />trapped. There's no way out.
4824528 4826488 Be calm. Give me your phone.
4826613 4828155 They'll be able to track it.
4828407 4829824 We have no choice.
4830908 4831908 Operator.
4831968 4835618 <i>Tank, find a structural drawing<br />of this building. Find it fast.</i>
4843463 4846048 - Got it!<br /><i>- I need the main wet-wall.</i>
4848885 4850136 Eighth floor.
4850345 4851929 <i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>
4852222 4853681 Switch, straight ahead.
4854433 4855599 Neo...
4861732 4863858 I hope the Oracle<br />gave you some good news.
4872159 4873659 <i>Now left. That's it.</i>
4873952 4874994 Good.
4884713 4886005 Where are they?
4946441 4947608 They're in the walls.
4949069 4950236 In the walls!
4971633 4973300 It's an agent!
4980600 4981934 Morpheus!
4982102 4983352 You must get Neo out!
4983603 4985437 He's all that matters!
4985730 4987940 - No, Morpheus! Don't!<br />- Trinity, go!
4988900 4990234 Go!
4996491 4998409 - We can't leave him!<br />- We have to!
5022726 5024518 Cypher, come on!
5029441 5033277 The great Morpheus.<br />We meet at last.
5033820 5034945 And you are?
5035197 5036947 A Smith.
5037199 5038490 Agent Smith.
5039075 5041118 You all look the same to me.
5096758 5098050 Take him.
5104683 5106141 No!
5111273 5113083 - Operator.<br /><i>- Yeah, I need an exit, fast.</i>
5113107 5115098 - Cypher?<br />- Yeah.
5115193 5118112 There was an accident.<br />Goddamn car accident.
5118446 5120239 <i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>
5120490 5121865 Somebody up there still likes me.
5122117 5123367 I got you.
5123868 5125786 <i>G- get me out of here. Fast.</i>
5126037 5128706 Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.<br />An old TV repair shop.
5128957 5129999 Right.
5133128 5134712 - Operator.<br /><i>- Tank, it's me.</i>
5134963 5136130 Is Morpheus alive?
5136506 5137798 Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
5138216 5140216 <i>Yes. They're moving him.<br />I don't know where to yet.</i>
5140343 5142636 He's alive. We need an exit.
5142887 5143971 You're not far from Cypher.
5144138 5145548 <i>- Cypher?</i><br />- I know.
5145640 5147725 <i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i><br />- Got it.
5156818 5158027 Got him.
5168955 5169997 Where are they?
5170248 5171498 Making the call.
5172167 5173334 Good.
5186468 5188108 You first, Neo.
5190935 5192144 Shit!
5195440 5197107 Tank!
5197275 5198901 No!
5200820 5202988 I don't know. It just went dead.
5229808 5231016 <i>Hello, Trinity.</i>
5231434 5232768 Cypher? Where's Tank?
5238108 5239548 You know...
5241111 5243237 for a long time...
5244447 5247324 I thought I was in love with you.
5248118 5250160 <i>I used to dream about you.</i>
5251246 5253956 You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
5254207 5256583 <i>Too bad things had to<br />turn out this way.</i>
5257127 5258168 You killed them.
5258670 5260170 - What?<br />- Oh, God.
5260422 5261839 I'm tired, Trinity.
5263258 5265134 I'm tired of this war...
5265427 5268262 tired of fighting.<br />I'm tired of this ship...
5268596 5273225 of being cold, of eating<br />the same goddamn goop every day.
5275428 5276948 But most of all...
5277147 5280524 <i>I'm tired of that jack-off<br />and all of his bullshit.</i>
5281648 5283188 Surprise, asshole!
5283486 5285696 I bet you never saw this coming...
5285947 5286989 did you?
5289284 5291660 God, I wish I could be there...
5292245 5293745 when they break you.
5294789 5297958 I wish I could walk in<br />just when it happens...
5298668 5300377 so right then...
5300628 5301962 you'd know it was me.
5302464 5303630 You gave them Morpheus.
5303882 5305340 <i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>
5305925 5307426 He tricked us!
5307969 5309970 If you had told us the truth...
5310221 5313098 we would've told you to shove<br />that red pill up your ass!
5313349 5315476 That is not true, Cypher.<br />He set us free.
5315727 5318604 "Free." You call this free?
5321024 5323525 All I do is what he tells me to do.
5325111 5328030 If I had to choose between<br />that and the Matrix...
5329199 5330407 I choose the Matrix.
5330658 5332326 The Matrix isn't real.
5332577 5333994 <i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>
5334245 5336497 I think the Matrix...
5336831 5339416 can be more real than this world.
5341586 5344087 All I do is pull the plug here.
5344464 5345672 But there...
5346216 5348509 <i>you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
5349511 5350761 Trinity.
5352988 5354228 No!
5356258 5358264 <i>Welcome to the real world, huh, baby?</i>
5358288 5359382 But you're out, Cypher.
5359406 5360304 <i>You can't go back.</i>
5360328 5362008 Oh no. That's what you think.
5362148 5363649 <i>They're gonna reinsert my body.</i>
5363900 5364845 <i>I go back to sleep.</i>
5364869 5367528 <i>And when I wake up,<br />I won't remember a goddamn thing.</i>
5367737 5368779 By the way...
5369030 5371990 if you have anything<br />terribly important to say to Switch...
5372488 5373844 <i>I suggest you say it now.</i>
5373868 5376870 - No, please don't.<br />- Not like this.
5378581 5380207 Not like this.
5384671 5385712 Too late.
5385968 5387688 Goddamn you, Cypher!
5388007 5389883 Don't hate me, Trinity.
5390260 5392135 I'm just a messenger.
5392554 5395722 And right now,<br />I'm going to prove it to you.
5396808 5398475 If Morpheus was right...
5399018 5400894 there's no way<br />I can pull this plug.
5401479 5402980 <i>If Neo's the One...</i>
5403481 5405315 <i>then there'd have to be...</i>
5405567 5408151 some kind of a miracle to stop me.
5408319 5409528 Right?
5410154 5412239 I mean, how can he be the One...
5412407 5413490 if he's dead?
5414867 5417119 <i>You never did answer me before...</i>
5417412 5419746 <i>if you bought into Morpheus' bullshit.</i>
5420123 5423333 Come on.<br />All I want is a little yes or no.
5424711 5427045 Look into his eyes...
5427797 5429298 <i>those big, pretty eyes...</i>
5432051 5433385 and tell me...
5434095 5435345 <i>yes...</i>
5435680 5437055 <i>or no.</i>
5438349 5439891 - Yes.<br /><i>- No!</i>
5440059 5441226 I don't believe it.
5442645 5447399 Believe it or not, you piece of shit,<br />you're still going to burn!
5465668 5467044 You first.
5475261 5477554 - You're hurt.<br />- I'll be all right.
5480350 5481516 Dozer?
5499786 5502162 Have you ever stood and stared at it?
5503039 5506166 Marveled at its beauty...
5506542 5508794 its genius?
5509962 5511838 Billions of people just...
5512090 5514841 living out their lives.
5515885 5517552 Oblivious.
5522141 5525018 Did you know that the first Matrix...
5525269 5529940 was designed to be a perfect<br />human world where none suffered...
5530441 5533360 where everyone would be happy.
5533903 5535404 It was a disaster.
5535655 5539991 No one would accept the program.<br />Entire crops were lost.
5540868 5542619 Some believed that...
5542870 5547249 we lacked the programming language<br />to describe your perfect world.
5547500 5549168 But, I believed that...
5549208 5550768 as a species...
5550828 5554388 human beings define<br />their reality through misery...
5554716 5556091 and suffering.
5556338 5558688 So the perfect world was a dream...
5558748 5564138 that your primitive cerebrum<br />kept trying to wake up from.
5565476 5569146 Which is why the Matrix was<br />redesigned to this.
5569598 5570868 The peak of...
5571028 5572768 your civilization.
5573025 5575277 I say, "your civilization"...
5575528 5579894 because as soon as we started thinking<br />for you, it really became our civilization...
5579918 5583468 which is, of course,<br />what this is all about.
5584328 5586913 Evolution, Morpheus.
5587206 5588540 Evolution.
5590835 5592711 Like the dinosaur.
5594881 5596506 Look out that window.
5597216 5599342 You had your time.
5600052 5603972 The future is our world, Morpheus.
5604307 5606683 The future is our time.
5610938 5612105 There could be a problem.
5613024 5616401 - What are they doing to him?<br />- They're breaking into his mind.
5616652 5618820 It's like hacking a computer.<br />All it takes is time.
5619071 5620280 How much time?
5620531 5623658 Depends on the mind.<br />But eventually, it'll crack...
5623910 5628330 and his alpha patterns<br />will change from this to this.
5628581 5631541 When it does, Morpheus will tell them<br />anything they want to know.
5631793 5632834 What do they want?
5633085 5637130 The leader of every ship is given<br />codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
5637381 5640300 If an agent got the codes<br />and got into Zion's mainframe...
5640548 5643268 they could destroy us.<br />We can't let that happen.
5643488 5646048 Trinity, Zion's more important than me...
5646224 5647390 or you...
5647558 5648850 or even Morpheus.
5652647 5654487 Well, there has to be<br />something that we can do.
5654732 5656733 There is. We pull the plug.
5659821 5661571 You're going to kill him?
5661823 5662989 Kill Morpheus?
5663616 5665242 We don't have any other choice.
5672041 5674960 Never send a human<br />to do a machine's job.
5675208 5677148 If indeed the insider has failed...
5677208 5680568 they'll sever the connection<br />as soon as possible, unless --
5680668 5682568 They're dead. In either case --
5682635 5686179 Then we have no choice, but continue<br />as planned. Deploy the sentinels.
5686430 5687514 Immediately.
5692770 5695438 Morpheus, you were more<br />than a leader to us.
5696399 5698608 You were a father.
5700152 5702112 We'll miss you always.
5708995 5710203 Stop!
5711372 5712732 I don't believe this is happening.
5712874 5714916 - Neo, this has to be done.<br />- Does it?
5715710 5717085 I don't know, I...
5717418 5720065 - This can't be just coincidence. It can't be.<br />- What are you talking about?
5720089 5721339 The Oracle.
5721591 5723383 She told me this would happen.
5723801 5727971 She told me that I would<br />have to make a choice.
5728431 5729639 What choice?
5732643 5735145 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm going in.
5735479 5737814 - No, you're not.<br />- I have to.
5738024 5741651 Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself<br />so that we could get you out.
5741903 5743820 There is no way<br />that you're going back in.
5744405 5747657 Morpheus did what he did because<br />he believed I'm something I'm not.
5749160 5750201 What?
5750912 5752537 I'm not the One, Trinity.
5752914 5755874 - The Oracle hit me with that too.<br />- No, you have to be.
5756125 5758793 I'm sorry, I'm not.<br />I'm just another guy.
5759462 5760712 No, Neo, that's not true.
5761297 5763924 - It can't be true.<br />- Why?
5767648 5772064 Neo, this is loco. They've got Morpheus<br />in a military-controlled building.
5772088 5776568 Even if you somehow got inside, those<br />are agents holding him. Three of them.
5777605 5781524 I want Morpheus back too, but<br />what you're talking about is suicide.
5781776 5783360 I know that's what it looks like...
5783527 5784569 but it's not.
5784820 5787197 I can't explain to you why it's not.
5788278 5789988 Morpheus believed something.
5790128 5793828 And he was ready to give his life for<br />what he believed. I understand that now.
5794248 5795664 That's why I have to go.
5795688 5798041 - Why?<br />- Because I believe in something.
5798209 5799834 What?
5800544 5802253 I believe I can bring him back.
5819228 5821568 - What are you doing?<br />- Going with you.
5821688 5823688 - No, you're not.<br />- "No"?
5824610 5826736 Let me tell you what I believe.
5827238 5829614 I believe Morpheus means more<br />to me than he does to you.
5829948 5833908 I believe if you are really serious about<br />saving him, you are going to need my help.
5834488 5836844 And since I am the ranking<br />officer on this ship...
5836868 5839666 if you don't like it,<br />I believe you can go to hell.
5840418 5842836 Because you aren't going anywhere else.
5843254 5844796 Tank...
5844964 5846089 load us up.
5855725 5859019 I'd like to share<br />a revelation that I've had...
5859437 5860979 during my time here.
5861230 5865233 It came to me when I tried<br />to classify your species...
5865484 5867736 and I realized that...
5867987 5870280 you're not actually mammals.
5872491 5874951 Every mammal on this planet...
5875286 5880206 instinctively develops a natural<br />equilibrium with the surrounding environment.
5880458 5882292 But you humans do not.
5882835 5886379 You move to an area<br />and you multiply...
5886630 5891134 and multiply until every<br />natural resource is consumed.
5891468 5893748 The only way you can survive...
5893846 5896806 is to spread to another area.
5902228 5905228 There is another organism<br />on this planet that...
5905357 5907317 follows the same pattern.
5907943 5909611 Do you know what it is?
5909987 5911821 A virus.
5913157 5916201 Human beings are a disease.
5916568 5918288 A cancer of this planet.
5918370 5920497 You are a plague.
5921040 5922457 And we...
5922625 5924000 are the cure.
5925002 5926419 Okay, so what do you need?
5927038 5928468 Besides a miracle.
5928756 5929964 Guns.
5930800 5932008 Lots of guns.
5941894 5943103 Neo...
5944855 5947398 No one has ever done<br />anything like this.
5948609 5950527 That's why it's going to work.
5954615 5956533 Why isn't the serum working?
5957159 5959452 Perhaps we're asking<br />the wrong questions.
5961539 5962789 Leave me with him.
5965376 5966501 Now.
5977721 5979305 Hold on, Morpheus.
5979557 5982267 They're coming for you.<br />They're coming.
5984645 5986771 Can you hear me, Morpheus?
5987022 5989691 I'm going to be honest...
5990067 5991276 with you.
5995656 5997073 I...
5997950 5999075 hate...
5999326 6001286 this place...
6001620 6003913 this zoo...
6004165 6005290 this prison...
6005541 6008710 this reality,<br />whatever you want to call it.
6008961 6011254 I can't stand it any longer.
6012006 6013882 It's the smell.
6015259 6017135 If there is such a thing.
6017469 6020763 I feel saturated by it.
6022266 6023558 I can...
6023809 6025351 taste...
6025519 6027562 your stink.
6027813 6031441 And every time I do, I fear that<br />I have somehow been infected by it.
6031609 6032609 It's repulsive.
6033611 6034986 Isn't it?
6037156 6039449 I must get out of here.
6039867 6042076 I must get free.
6042328 6045205 And in this mind is the key.
6045456 6047123 My key.
6047374 6050251 Once Zion is destroyed,<br />there is no need for me to be here.
6050502 6052128 Do you understand?
6052421 6053796 I need the codes.
6054048 6056382 I have to get inside Zion...
6056717 6059219 and you have to tell me how.
6059637 6061512 You're going to tell me...
6061764 6063932 or you're going to die.
6084119 6087247 Please remove any metallic items<br />you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
6091168 6092210 Holy shit!
6104306 6107016 Backup. Send backup.
6130833 6131958 Freeze!
6266802 6268010 What were you doing?
6269847 6271139 He doesn't know.
6271390 6272890 Know what?
6300961 6303463 I think they're trying to save him.
6318312 6320062 There is no spoon.
6349676 6351844 Find them and destroy them!
6353472 6355306 I repeat, we're under attack!
6387422 6388589 Trinity!
6389091 6390174 Help!
6412197 6413406 Only human.
6414366 6415449 Dodge this.
6428672 6430172 - How did you do that?<br />- Do what?
6430591 6434510 You moved like they do.<br />I've never seen anyone move that fast.
6435637 6437013 It wasn't fast enough.
6439766 6441058 Can you fly that thing?
6442185 6443185 Not yet.
6446188 6447328 Operator.
6447368 6450898 <i>Tank, I need a pilot program<br />for a B-212 helicopter.</i>
6451361 6452653 <i>Hurry.</i>
6460579 6462204 Let's go.
6477304 6478387 No.
6529981 6532608 Morpheus, get up.<br />Get up, get up.
6570647 6571689 He's not going to make it.
6581491 6582533 Got you.
6648600 6649767 Trinity!
6691434 6692852 I knew it.
6693478 6694687 He's the One.
6710662 6712872 Do you believe it now, Trinity?
6715750 6716917 Morpheus...
6718587 6719670 The Oracle.
6720922 6723299 - She told me I...<br />- She told you...
6723675 6725259 exactly what you needed to hear.
6725552 6726886 That's all.
6727929 6730890 Neo, sooner or later you'll<br />realize, just as I did...
6731224 6733517 there's a difference<br />between knowing the path...
6734268 6735828 and walking the path.
6738607 6739815 - Operator.<br /><i>- Tank.</i>
6740728 6743428 - Goddamn, it's good to hear your voice, sir.<br /><i>- We need an exit.</i>
6743528 6746728 Got one ready. Subway station,<br />State and Balboa.
6759377 6761795 - Damn it!<br />- The trace was completed.
6762047 6765633 - We have their position.<br />- Sentinels are standing by.
6767344 6768844 Order the strike.
6775393 6777394 They're not out yet.
6788573 6789907 You first, Morpheus.
6810595 6812888 Neo, I want to tell you something...
6816142 6820104 but I'm afraid of<br />what it could mean if I do.
6823692 6826986 Everything the Oracle<br />told me has come true.
6829739 6831281 Everything but this.
6832784 6833826 But what?
6858727 6859893 Neo!
6860145 6861770 - What happened?<br />- An agent.
6862022 6863939 - Send me back.<br />- I can't.
6865984 6867943 Mr. Anderson.
6870155 6871530 Run, Neo. Run.
6876828 6878454 What is he doing?
6878705 6879955 He's beginning to believe.
6906941 6908317 You're empty.
6908902 6910194 So are you.
6943353 6946355 I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
6947482 6948524 Mr. Anderson.
6989482 6991567 Jesus, he's killing him.
7077737 7079863 You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
7080615 7083617 That is the sound of inevitability.
7086204 7089539 It is the sound of your death.
7090458 7092793 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7093044 7094670 My name...
7097674 7099716 is Neo.
7131958 7134167 - What happened?<br />- I don't know. I lost him.
7136671 7137713 Oh, shit.
7150101 7151560 Sentinels.
7152312 7154563 - How long?<br />- Five, maybe six minutes.
7156607 7158775 Tank, charge the EMP.
7159027 7162070 - We can't use that until he's out.<br />- I know. Don't worry.
7163239 7164323 He's gonna make it.
7164574 7166450 Flat or pumps? No, just --
7166701 7169578 What the shit? That's my phone!
7169996 7171580 That guy took my phone!
7173958 7176251 Got him!<br />He's on the run.
7176502 7179171 Mr. Wizard, get me out of here!
7179422 7181298 <i>I got an old exit.<br />Wabash and Lake.</i>
7185261 7186261 Oh, shit!
7207825 7209826 Help! Need a little help!
7211454 7212662 <i>The door.</i>
7228638 7230138 <i>The door on your left.</i>
7231057 7232307 <i>Your other left!</i>
7239023 7240273 <i>The back door.</i>
7261045 7262170 Oh, no.
7263840 7265340 Here they come.
7294120 7295370 He's going to make it.
7305590 7308717 <i>The fire escape at the<br />end of the alley, room 303.</i>
7343836 7344920 They're inside.
7347256 7348298 Hurry, Neo.
7404522 7405647 It can't be.
7413447 7414823 Check him.
7418828 7420370 He's gone.
7427086 7429504 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7437096 7438138 Neo...
7439599 7441558 I'm not afraid anymore.
7443008 7444264 The Oracle told me...
7444288 7447188 that I would fall in love, and that, that man...
7448068 7450708 the man that I loved would be the One.
7453237 7455196 So you see...
7455906 7457907 you can't be dead.
7459493 7461328 You can't be...
7462872 7465040 because I love you.
7466876 7468585 You hear me?
7469712 7471379 I love you.
7495112 7496404 Now, get up.
7505081 7506247 No.
7532983 7534025 How?
7534902 7535944 He is the One.
7622698 7624157 Neo!
7680422 7682131 <i>I know you're out there.</i>
7682383 7684217 <i>I can feel you now.</i>
7684635 7688263 <i>I know that you're afraid.<br />You're afraid of us.</i>
7688597 7690431 <i>You're afraid of change.</i>
7691892 7693226 <i>I don't know the future.</i>
7693394 7695979 <i>I didn't come here to tell you<br />how this is going to end.</i>
7696230 7699190 <i>I came here to tell you<br />how it's going to begin.</i>
7700150 7701734 <i>I'll hang up this phone.</i>
7701986 7705071 <i>And then I'll show these people<br />what you don't want them to see.</i>
7705322 7707198 <i>I'm going to show them a world...</i>
7707449 7709200 <i>without you.</i>
7709493 7713121 <i>A world without rules and controls,<br />without borders or boundaries.</i>
7713372 7717083 <i>A world where anything is possible.</i>
7719712 7721045 <i>Where we go from there...</i>
7721297 7723256 <i>is a choice I leave to you.</i>
