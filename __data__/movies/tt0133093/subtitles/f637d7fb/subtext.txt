150859 155280 You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"<br />crap, you can cram it up your ass.
155739 158241 The orders were for your protection.

159743 161953 I think we can handle one little girl.
167084 168835 I sent two units!

203120 204204 TRINITY:<br />Shit.
207124 209209 Morpheus, the line was traced.<br />I don't know how.

483692 485527 Yeah. Yeah.
492075 493243 You're two hours late.
493827 495578 I know. It's her fault.
495745 496830 You got the money?
498957 500125 Two grand.

519811 521187 CHOI:<br />Hallelujah.
521438 524315 You're my savior.<br />My own personal Jesus Christ.
524566 526443 You get caught using that...
526693 528820 I know. This never happened.<br />You don't exist.
529946 532032 NEO: Right.<br />CHOI: Something wrong, man?
532282 534325 You look a little whiter than usual.
535452 537620 My computer, it...
540623 545170 Ever have that feeling where you're<br />not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
545962 548715 All the time.<br />It's called mescaline.
549215 551342 It's the only way to fly.

611111 612195 Hello, Neo.
613530 614697 How do you know that name?
615532 617242 I know a lot about you.
618118 620203 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
621162 622372 Trinity.
623998 625166 The Trinity?
625625 627335 That cracked the IRS D-base?
627585 629045 That was a long time ago.
629295 631214 - Jesus.<br />- What?
631673 633466 I just thought...
635218 636386 ...you were a guy.
636636 638096 Most guys do.
639305 641516 That was you on my computer.
642142 643226 How did you do that?
643893 646604 Right now, all I can tell you...
647230 648773 ...is that you're in danger.
649232 651651 TRINITY: I brought you here to warn you.<br />- Of what?
652235 653903 They're watching you, Neo.
654487 656906 - Who is?<br />- Please just listen.
660410 662245 I know why you're here, Neo.
663037 664998 I know what you've been doing.
665248 667125 I know why you hardly sleep...
667417 670545 ...why you live alone and why,<br />night after night...
670795 673131 ...you sit at your computer.
674299 675842 You're looking for him.
676634 679637 I know, because I was once<br />looking for the same thing.
680138 682265 And when he found me...
682891 685977 ...he told me I wasn't really<br />looking for him...
686895 688646 ...I was looking for an answer.
689272 692400 It's the question that drives us, Neo.
693067 695737 It's the question<br />that brought you here.
697822 699199 You know the question...
699449 700950 ...just as I did.
702493 704120 What is the Matrix?
704370 706831 The answer is out there, Neo.
707498 709500 It's looking for you.
710293 711961 And it will find you...
712253 714255 ...if you want it to.

733650 736486 You have a problem with authority,<br />Mr. Anderson.
736736 740782 You believe that you are special,<br />that the rules do not apply to you.
741491 743493 Obviously, you are mistaken.
746454 749332 This is one of the top<br />software companies in the world...
749582 752961 ...because employees understand<br />they are part of a whole.
753211 757840 Thus, if an employee has a problem,<br />the company has a problem.
760093 763304 The time has come to make<br />a choice, Mr. Anderson.
764180 768059 Either you choose to be at your desk<br />on time from this day forth...
768685 771271 ...or you choose to find another job.
772146 773481 Do I make myself clear?
773731 776150 Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.<br />Perfectly clear.

871704 874374 - Okay.<br /><i>- The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>
877502 879629 - But what if they...<br /><i>- Go. Now.</i>
886386 888763 <i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>
895978 898731 <i>When I tell you,<br />go to the end of the row...</i>
898981 900942 <i>...to the office<br />at the end of the hall.</i>
901192 903569 <i>Stay as low as you can.</i>
905863 906989 <i>Go. Now.</i>
921379 924924 <i>Good. Now, outside<br />there is a scaffold.</i>
927635 929971 - How do you know this?<br /><i>- We don't have time.</i>
930221 933057 <i>To your left there's a window.<br />Go to it.</i>
935309 936853 <i>Open it.</i>
937687 939480 <i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>
939730 942316 No way! No way!<br />This is crazy!
942567 944944 <i>There are two ways<br />out of this building.</i>
945194 948990 <i>One is that scaffold.<br />The other is in their custody.</i>
949240 952452 <i>You take a chance either way.<br />I leave it to you.</i>
956038 957790 This is insane!
958958 960835 Why is this happening to me?
961127 962753 What'd I do?
963129 965882 I'm nobody.<br />I didn't do anything.
966466 967925 I'm gonna die.
977727 978769 Shit!
999040 1000166 Oh, shit!
1005129 1006923 I can't do this.
1019560 1020603 Shit.
1069860 1074699 As you can see, we've had our eye on<br />you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
1075992 1078661 It seems that you've been living...
1078911 1081038 ...two lives.
1082456 1084959 In one life,<br />you're Thomas A. Anderson...
1085209 1088546 ...program writer for<br />a respectable software company.
1089589 1092883 You have a social security number.<br />You pay your taxes.
1093342 1094594 And you...
1096178 1099807 ...help your landlady<br />carry out her garbage.
1102310 1105438 The other life is lived in computers...
1105730 1108691 ...where you go by<br />the hacker alias "Neo"...
1108941 1113738 ...and are guilty of virtually every<br />computer crime we have a law for.
1115031 1116991 One of these lives...
1117241 1119076 ...has a future.
1119410 1121412 And one of them does not.
1125124 1128961 I'm going to be as forthcoming<br />as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
1129962 1131297 You're here...
1131631 1133883 ...because we need your help.
1137511 1140514 We know that you've been contacted<br />by a certain...
1140765 1142558 ...individual.
1143476 1147521 A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
1148522 1152526 Whatever you think you know<br />about this man is irrelevant.
1152777 1155196 He is considered by many authorities...
1155446 1158491 ...to be the most dangerous man alive.
1161202 1162411 My colleagues...
1162870 1165790 ...believe that I am wasting<br />my time with you.
1166082 1169502 But I believe you wish<br />to do the right thing.
1169794 1173297 We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
1173673 1175800 ...give you a fresh start.
1176300 1179220 All we're asking in return<br />is your cooperation...
1179470 1182973 ...in bringing<br />a known terrorist to justice.
1184350 1185601 Yeah.
1186894 1188979 That sounds like a really good deal.
1190606 1192358 But I got a better one.
1192608 1194110 How about...
1194527 1196529 ...I give you the finger...
1199115 1201117 ...and you give me my phone call.
1203327 1205162 Mr. Anderson...
1209333 1210376 ...you disappoint me.
1210626 1213254 You can't scare me<br />with this gestapo crap.
1213504 1214880 I know my rights.
1215131 1216632 I want my phone call.
1217216 1219385 Tell me, Mr. Anderson...
1220261 1221679 ...what good is a phone call...
1221929 1225516 ...if you're unable to speak?
1259300 1261510 You're going to help us,<br />Mr. Anderson...
1262011 1264180 ...whether you want to or not.

1330663 1332498 <i>If they knew what I know...</i>
1332748 1334750 <i>...you would probably be dead.</i>

1339713 1344552 <i>You are the One, Neo. You may have<br />spent the last few years...</i>
1344802 1347763 <i>...looking for me, but I've spent<br />my entire life...</i>
1348013 1349515 <i>...looking for you.</i>
1351058 1353227 <i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>
1354186 1357064 - Yes.<br /><i>- Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>
1367283 1368492 Get in.
1380546 1381589 What's this?
1381839 1384383 It's necessary, Neo.<br />For our protection.
1384633 1386802 - From what?<br />- From you.
1388345 1389805 - Take off your shirt.<br />- What?
1389972 1391140 Stop the car.
1395728 1396896 Listen, coppertop.
1397146 1399148 We don't have time for 20 Questions.
1399648 1402026 Right now, there's only one rule:
1402318 1403652 Our way...
1403986 1405070 ...or the highway.
1411619 1412703 Fine.
1414580 1417041 Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
1417625 1420252 - Why?<br />- Because you have been down there.
1421003 1422212 You know that road.
1423213 1424840 You know exactly where it ends.
1427051 1429303 And I know that's<br />not where you want to be.
1443484 1445027 Apoc, lights.
1447529 1449698 TRINITY: Lie back.<br />Lift up your shirt.
1451617 1453869 - What's that?<br />- You're bugged.
1461627 1463087 Try and relax.
1469385 1470552 Come on.
1471595 1472638 Come on.
1474390 1475391 It's on the move.
1477184 1478394 Come on, you shit.
1480229 1482481 - You're gonna lose it.<br />- No, I'm not.
1482648 1483732 Clear!
1492324 1494451 Jesus Christ!<br />That thing's real!?
1528193 1529528 This is it.
1532865 1535325 Let me give you one piece of advice.
1536285 1537953 Be honest.
1539538 1541749 He knows more than you can imagine.
1550466 1551800 At last.
1553343 1554428 Welcome, Neo.
1555637 1557556 As you no doubt have guessed...
1557806 1559058 ...I am Morpheus.
1560100 1561685 It's an honor to meet you.
1562144 1563187 No...
1563771 1565064 ...the honor is mine.
1565981 1568484 Please, come. Sit.
1583582 1585209 I imagine...
1585626 1588378 ...that right now you're feeling<br />a bit like Alice...
1590089 1592508 ...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
1593342 1594426 You could say that.
1595344 1597971 I can see it in your eyes.
1598555 1601850 You have the look of a man<br />who accepts what he sees...
1602101 1604353 ...because he's expecting to wake up.
1605771 1608357 Ironically, this is not<br />far from the truth.
1609066 1611443 Do you believe in fate, Neo?
1611610 1612694 No.
1613112 1614154 Why not?
1614404 1617199 I don't like the idea that<br />I'm not in control of my life.
1618283 1621620 I know exactly what you mean.
1625916 1628293 Let me tell you why you're here.
1629336 1630879 You know something.
1631421 1633048 What you know,<br />you can't explain.
1633549 1635134 But you feel it.
1635717 1637636 You felt it your entire life:
1638220 1642391 Something's wrong with the world.<br />You don't know what, but it's there.
1642891 1645102 Like a splinter in your mind...
1645352 1647229 ...driving you mad.
1648147 1650899 It is this feeling<br />that has brought you to me.
1653443 1655279 Do you know what<br />I'm talking about?
1657114 1658448 The Matrix?
1660951 1662619 Do you want to know...
1663078 1665080 ...what it is?
1667457 1669334 The Matrix is everywhere.
1669585 1671295 It is all around us.
1671545 1673505 Even now, in this very room.
1674339 1676550 You can see it when you<br />look out your window...
1676800 1679136 ...or when you turn on your television.
1679553 1682097 You can feel it when you go to work...
1683640 1685309 ...when you go to church...
1685726 1687811 ...when you pay your taxes.
1688937 1691857 It is the world that has been<br />pulled over your eyes...
1692107 1693692 ...to blind you from the truth.
1695903 1697154 What truth?
1701408 1702951 That you are a slave.
1704453 1706747 Like everyone else,<br />you were born into bondage...
1706997 1711668 ...born into a prison that you cannot<br />smell or taste or touch.
1711960 1713253 A prison...
1713503 1714630 ...for your mind.
1721637 1723972 Unfortunately, no one can be...
1724306 1726683 ...told what the Matrix is.
1730145 1732022 You have to see it for yourself.
1741531 1743825 This is your last chance.
1744076 1746411 After this, there is no turning back.
1746870 1748330 You take the blue pill...
1748664 1751708 ...the story ends, you wake up<br />in your bed and believe...
1751959 1753752 ...whatever you want to believe.
1754002 1755337 You take the red pill...
1755587 1757547 ...you stay in Wonderland...
1758048 1760759 ...and I show you how deep<br />the rabbit hole goes.
1770644 1771853 Remember...
1772688 1775732 ...all I'm offering is the truth.<br />Nothing more.
1790038 1791373 Follow me.
1793917 1795585 Apoc, are we on-line?
1795836 1797212 APOC:<br />Almost.
1800549 1802592 MORPHEUS:<br />Time is always against us.
1802968 1804469 Please take a seat there.
1822654 1824364 -You did all this?<br />TRINITY: Mm-hm.
1828493 1830495 The pill you took is<br />part of a trace program.
1831246 1835876 It disrupts your carrier signals<br />so we can pinpoint your location.
1836418 1837461 What does that mean?
1838045 1840213 It means buckle your<br />seat belt, Dorothy...
1840547 1841882 ...because Kansas...
1842132 1843175 ...is going bye-bye.
1881088 1882464 Did you...?
1893475 1897562 Have you ever had a dream, Neo,<br />that you were so sure was real?
1899022 1901608 What if you were unable<br />to wake from that dream?
1901858 1904361 How would you know the difference<br />between the dream world...
1904986 1906405 ...and the real world?
1908031 1909199 NEO:<br />This can't be.
1909366 1910409 MORPHEUS:<br />Be what?
1911118 1912619 Be real?
1916581 1917999 - Going into replication.<br />- Apoc?
1918208 1919209 Still nothing.
1919793 1921002 NEO:<br />It's cold.
1921253 1922629 It's cold!
1926508 1928176 Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
1929678 1932347 - I got a fibrillation.<br />- Apoc, location.
1932597 1934057 APOC:<br />Targeting almost there.
1937352 1938770 He's going into arrest.
1939020 1941523 - Lock. I got him!<br />- Now, Tank, now!
2118783 2119868 Welcome...
2120201 2122120 ...to the real world.
2123538 2125373 MORPHEUS:<br />We've done it, Trinity.
2125624 2127167 We found him.
2127417 2130211 -I hope you're right.<br />MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.
2130795 2132380 I know it.
2137552 2138595 Am I dead?
2139095 2141264 Far from it.
2155236 2156655 He still needs a lot of work.
2158198 2159282 What are you doing?
2159532 2161743 Your muscles atrophied.<br />We're rebuilding them.
2162327 2163870 Why do my eyes hurt?
2164579 2166456 You've never used them before.
2170210 2171252 Rest, Neo.
2171503 2173171 The answers are coming.
2243825 2245410 [DOOR OPENS]
2247746 2249330 Morpheus, what's happened to me?
2249956 2251040 What is this place?
2251291 2253960 More important than "what" is "when."
2254461 2255503 "When"?
2255712 2257756 You believe it's the year 1999...
2258006 2260258 ...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.
2261384 2264137 I can't tell you exactly<br />what year it is...
2264387 2266014 ...because we honestly don't know.
2266514 2269350 There's nothing I can say<br />that will explain it for you.
2269601 2272353 Come with me.<br />See for yourself.
2272896 2274647 MORPHEUS:<br />This is my ship.
2274939 2277859 The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i><br />It's a hovercraft.
2280695 2282447 This is the main deck.
2288203 2289454 This is the core...
2291956 2295710 ...where we broadcast our pirate signal<br />and hack into the Matrix.
2299088 2302258 Most of my crew you already know.
2307263 2308681 This is Apoc...
2309474 2310809 ...Switch...
2312393 2313561 - ...and Cypher.<br />- Hi.
2313812 2317524 The ones you don't know:<br />Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
2318399 2320819 The little one behind you is Mouse.
2325156 2328409 You wanted to know<br />what the Matrix is?
2329452 2330662 Trinity.
2351683 2353268 Try to relax.
2358147 2359983 This will feel a little weird.
2371953 2373329 This...
2373496 2375206 ...is the Construct.
2375623 2377750 It's our loading program.
2378001 2380461 We can load anything, from clothing...
2380712 2382088 ...to equipment...
2382380 2383715 ...weapons...
2384340 2386175 ...training simulations...
2386551 2389095 ...anything we need.
2391890 2394309 NEO: Right now we're inside<br />a computer program?
2394601 2396519 Is it really so hard to believe?
2397020 2399647 Your clothes are different.<br />The plugs in your body are gone.
2400857 2402942 Your hair has changed.
2403318 2406654 Your appearance now is what we call<br />"residual self-image."
2407363 2409991 It is the mental projection<br />of your digital self.
2415872 2416998 This isn't real?
2417248 2418791 What is "real"?
2419167 2421419 How do you define "real"?
2421711 2423630 If you're talking about<br />what you can feel...
2423880 2426299 ...what you can smell, taste and see...
2426549 2430428 ...then "real" is simply electrical<br />signals interpreted by your brain.
2434599 2437018 This is the world that you know.
2438436 2441481 The world as it was at the end<br />of the 20th century.
2443858 2448196 It exists now only as part of<br />a neural-interactive simulation...
2448446 2449697 ...that we call the Matrix.
2454243 2457038 You've been living<br />in a dream world, Neo.
2458039 2459165 This is the world...
2459457 2461209 ...as it exists today.
2474263 2477225 Welcome to "the desert...
2478101 2479686 ...of the real."
2483064 2485441 We have only bits and pieces<br />of information.
2485692 2489487 But what we know for certain<br />is that in the early 21st century...
2489737 2492991 ...all of mankind was united<br />in celebration.
2493241 2497996 We marveled at our own magnificence<br />as we gave birth to AI.
2498788 2499914 AI.
2500957 2502333 You mean artificial intelligence.
2502583 2507005 A singular consciousness that spawned<br />an entire race of machines.
2507839 2511300 We don't know who struck first,<br />us or them.
2511718 2514929 But we know that it was us<br />that scorched the sky.
2516597 2518766 They were dependent on solar power...
2519017 2522353 ...and it was believed that<br />they would be unable to survive...
2522687 2526190 ...without an energy source<br />as abundant as the sun.
2526441 2531320 Throughout human history, we have<br />been dependent on machines to survive.
2532780 2536993 Fate, it seems, is not<br />without a sense of irony.
2540204 2544625 The human body generates more<br />bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
2544876 2549005 And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
2550923 2553092 Combined with a form of fusion...
2553426 2558264 ...the machines had found all the energy<br />they would ever need.
2562310 2566064 There are fields, Neo,<br />endless fields...
2566314 2569567 ...where human beings<br />are no longer born.
2570276 2572111 We are grown.
2578159 2580745 For the longest time,<br />I wouldn't believe it.
2580995 2583664 And then I saw the fields<br />with my own eyes...
2584999 2586626 ...watched them liquefy the dead...
2586876 2590213 ...so they could be fed intravenously<br />to the living.
2590755 2595009 And standing there,<br />facing the pure, horrifying precision...
2595259 2598179 ...I came to realize<br />the obviousness of the truth.
2600807 2602600 What is the Matrix?
2603810 2604852 Control.
2606229 2609607 The Matrix is a computer-generated<br />dream world...
2610399 2613486 ...built to keep us under control...
2614654 2617824 ...in order to change a human being...
2618449 2619617 ...into this.
2620993 2622120 No.
2623746 2625331 I don't believe it.
2625706 2626916 It's not possible.
2627500 2632088 I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.<br />I just said it would be the truth.
2632338 2633631 Stop!
2634173 2635383 Let me out!
2636092 2638010 Let me out! I want out!
2639971 2642640 - Easy, Neo. Easy.<br />- Get this thing out of me.
2642890 2644559 Get this thing out of me!
2646352 2647854 Don't touch me!
2648104 2649730 Stay away from me!
2650148 2651649 I don't believe it.
2652358 2653568 I don't believe it.
2653818 2655319 I don't believe it.
2655570 2657613 - He's gonna pop.<br />- Breathe, Neo.
2657989 2659073 Just breathe.
2677466 2679260 I can't go back, can I?
2680094 2681512 No.
2682346 2683556 But if you could...
2684390 2685892 ...would you really want to?
2688394 2689770 I owe you an apology.
2690354 2691731 We have a rule.
2692190 2695443 We never free a mind<br />once it's reached a certain age.
2695610 2696694 It's dangerous.
2697403 2699113 The mind has trouble letting go.
2699363 2701657 I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
2702700 2704785 I did what I did because...
2705494 2706954 ...I had to.
2715379 2719467 When the Matrix was first built,<br />there was a man born inside...
2719967 2723763 ...who had the ability<br />to change whatever he wanted...
2724138 2727058 ...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
2728809 2732271 It was he who freed the first of us...
2733147 2734774 ...taught us the truth.
2736234 2739320 As long as the Matrix exists...
2739654 2741739 ...the human race will never be free.
2745952 2747495 After he died...
2748246 2750957 ...the Oracle prophesied his return...
2751499 2754710 ...and that his coming would hail<br />the destruction of the Matrix...
2754961 2756629 ...end the war...
2756963 2758214 ...bring freedom to our people.
2759548 2764178 That is why there are those of us who<br />spent our lives searching the Matrix...
2764512 2766097 ...looking for him.
2768516 2770601 I did what I did because...
2772228 2774355 ...I believe that search is over.
2779443 2780861 Get some rest.
2781487 2783281 You're going to need it.
2785992 2787034 For what?
2790079 2791289 Your training.
2809598 2811309 Morning. Did you sleep?
2812184 2813394 You will tonight.
2813769 2815313 I guarantee it.
2816814 2818733 I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
2819191 2821610 - You don't have any...<br />- Holes? Nope.
2822528 2827241 Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%<br />pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
2827491 2828701 Born free right here...
2829243 2830578 ...in the real world.
2830828 2832496 Genuine child of Zion.
2833331 2835791 - Zion?<br />- If the war was over tomorrow...
2836042 2837543 ...Zion's where the party would be.
2837960 2839253 It's a city?
2839503 2842673 The last human city.<br />The only place we have left.
2844258 2845509 Where is it?
2847261 2850681 Deep underground near the Earth's core,<br />where it's still warm.
2852308 2854185 You live long enough,<br />you might see it.
2856437 2861275 Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited<br />to see what you're capable of...
2861525 2863277 ...if Morpheus is right and all.
2863778 2866530 We're not supposed to<br />talk about this, but...
2866781 2868199 ...if you are...
2869283 2871285 ...it's a very exciting time.
2872328 2875039 We got a lot to do.<br />We gotta get to it.
2878959 2881879 We're supposed to start<br />with these programs first.
2882880 2886342 That's major boring shit.<br />Let's do something more fun.
2886675 2888135 How about...
2889720 2891472 ...combat training?
2897520 2898979 "Jujitsu"?
2899855 2901524 I'm going to learn jujitsu?
2912868 2914078 Holy shit!
2914328 2916664 "Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
2916997 2918290 How about some more?
2918541 2919834 Hell, yes.
2921919 2922962 Hell, yeah.
2935141 2936225 How is he?
2936475 2938644 Ten hours straight.<br />He's a machine.
2949864 2951240 I know kung fu.
2952908 2953909 Show me.
2955703 2957455 This is a sparring program...
2957705 2960499 ...similar to the programmed reality<br />of the Matrix.
2960749 2963085 It has the same basic rules.<br />Like gravity.
2963335 2966797 These rules are no different<br />than those of a computer system.
2967339 2968841 Some of them can be bent.
2969049 2971510 Others can be broken.
2972052 2973137 Understand?
2974221 2975264 Then hit me...
2975848 2976974 ...if you can.
3015971 3017014 Good!
3017765 3018933 Adaptation.
3019225 3020434 Improvisation.
3020726 3022061 But your weakness...
3022311 3023687 ...is not your technique.
3030653 3032738 Morpheus is fighting Neo.
3105019 3106186 How did I beat you?
3112776 3113861 You're too fast.
3114403 3115738 Do you believe that...
3116113 3118616 ...my being stronger or faster...
3118866 3122536 ...has anything to do<br />with my muscles in this place?
3126582 3128375 You think you're breathing air?
3141889 3143098 Again!
3154568 3156987 Jesus Christ, he's fast!
3157237 3159448 His neuro-kinetics<br />are way above normal.
3164912 3166372 What are you waiting for?
3166622 3168582 You're faster than this.
3170793 3173003 Don't think you are.
3173253 3174922 Know you are.
3185307 3188102 Come on! Stop trying to hit me,<br />and hit me!
3198028 3199780 I don't believe it.
3201323 3203450 I know what you're trying to do.
3205119 3207287 I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
3207621 3209707 But I can only show you the door.
3210290 3212126 You have to walk through it.
3214503 3216630 Tank, load the jump program.
3228225 3230936 You have to let it all go, Neo.<br />Fear...
3231478 3233647 ...doubt and disbelief.
3234815 3237526 Free your mind.
3245784 3246910 Whoa.
3253709 3255419 Okey-dokey.
3257504 3258672 Free my mind.
3259131 3260257 What if he makes it?
3260507 3263218 -No one's ever made their first jump.<br />MOUSE: I know.
3264553 3267014 - But what if he does?<br />- He won't.
3267598 3268682 Come on.
3268932 3270100 All right.
3270559 3272603 No problem. Free my mind.
3273395 3276190 Free my mind. No problem. Right.
3295584 3297252 What does that mean?
3297628 3299463 It doesn't mean anything.
3300047 3302633 Everybody falls the first time.
3303091 3304384 Right, Trin?
3325072 3327699 - I thought it wasn't real.<br />- Your mind makes it real.
3330953 3333205 If you're killed in the Matrix...
3333372 3334414 ...you die here?
3335040 3337501 The body cannot live without the mind.
3367990 3371368 I don't remember you ever<br />bringing me dinner.
3374454 3377291 There is something about him,<br />isn't there?
3377916 3379543 You're a believer now?
3380544 3381753 I keep wondering...
3382004 3385674 ...if Morpheus is so sure,<br />why not take him to see the Oracle?
3386592 3389511 Morpheus will take him<br />when he's ready.
3399313 3400856 The Matrix is a system, Neo.
3402608 3403901 That system is our enemy.
3404526 3406862 But when you're inside,<br />what do you see?
3407112 3410908 Businessmen, teachers,<br />lawyers, carpenters.
3411366 3413952 The very minds of the people<br />we are trying to save.
3414202 3417164 But until we do, these people are<br />a part of that system...
3417414 3419333 ...and that makes them our enemy.
3419499 3420709 You have to understand...
3420959 3424296 ...most of these people are not<br />ready to be unplugged.
3424546 3426131 And many of them are so inert...
3426381 3428800 ...so hopelessly dependent<br />on the system...
3429051 3431762 ...that they will fight to protect it.
3433263 3437017 Were you listening to me or looking<br />at the woman in the red dress?
3437184 3438936 - I was...<br />- Look again.
3440187 3441271 Freeze it.
3447903 3449529 NEO: This isn't the Matrix?<br />MORPHEUS: No.
3451323 3455160 It's another training program<br />designed to teach you one thing:
3455786 3458205 If you are not one of us,<br />you are one of them.
3458747 3461541 - What are they?<br />- Sentient programs.
3462292 3466588 They can move in and out of any<br />software still hardwired to their system.
3466964 3470342 That means that anyone<br />we haven't unplugged...
3470676 3472010 ...is potentially an agent.
3472970 3474805 Inside the Matrix...
3475389 3477099 ...they are everyone...
3477432 3479142 ...and they are no one.
3479393 3482521 We have survived by hiding<br />and running from them...
3482771 3484398 ...but they are the gatekeepers.
3484648 3487609 They're guarding all the doors<br />and holding all the keys.
3487859 3490696 Sooner or later, someone will<br />have to fight them.
3490862 3492072 Someone?
3492406 3493824 MORPHEUS:<br />I won't lie to you, Neo.
3494282 3499121 Every single man or woman who<br />has fought an agent, has died.
3499371 3501748 But where they have failed,<br />you will succeed.
3501915 3503000 Why?
3503250 3505544 MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch<br />through a concrete wall.
3505794 3509381 Men have emptied entire clips at them<br />and hit nothing but air.
3509631 3514261 Yet their strength and speed are still<br />based in a world built on rules.
3514511 3515637 Because of that...
3515887 3519266 ...they will never be as strong<br />or as fast as you can be.
3523562 3525439 What are you telling me?
3526148 3527607 That I can dodge bullets?
3529609 3530986 No, Neo.
3531486 3534406 I'm trying to tell you<br />that when you're ready...
3535282 3536616 ...you won't have to.
3537951 3539453 [PHONE RINGS]
3540746 3541955 TANK:<br /><i>We got trouble.</i>
3560891 3563351 - Did Zion send the warning?<br />- No, another ship.
3566605 3567898 Shit.
3568148 3571026 - Squiddy's sweeping in quick.<br />- Squiddy?
3571234 3574446 A sentinel. A killing machine<br />designed for one thing.
3574696 3575906 Search and destroy.
3577240 3578408 Set her down there.
3599679 3601181 How are we doing, Tank?
3609898 3611066 Power off-line.
3611566 3613527 EMP armed...
3614069 3615612 - ...and ready.<br />- EMP?
3615904 3617781 Electromagnetic pulse.
3618031 3620909 Disables any electrical system<br />in the blast radius.
3621076 3623370 It's the only weapon we have<br />against the machines.
3629167 3632295 NEO: Where are we?<br />- Their old service and waste systems.
3633547 3634673 Sewers.
3634881 3637592 TRINITY: There used to be cities<br />that spanned hundreds of miles.
3638093 3640011 Now these sewers are<br />all that's left.
3640262 3641596 Quiet.
3682179 3683638 Whoa! Neo.
3685473 3687642 You scared the bejesus out of me.
3688727 3690645 - Sorry.<br />- It's okay.
3693148 3694399 Is that...?
3694649 3696234 The Matrix?
3696401 3697611 Yeah.
3699404 3702574 - Do you always look at it encoded?<br />- Well, you have to.
3702824 3705911 The image translators work<br />for the construct program.
3706161 3709581 But there's way too much information<br />to decode the Matrix.
3709831 3712792 You get used to it.<br />I don't even see the code.
3713043 3716463 All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
3717631 3719007 Do you...
3719299 3720383 ...want a drink?
3720634 3721676 Sure.
3725222 3726681 You know...
3727599 3729142 ...I know what you're thinking.
3729392 3731478 Because right now I'm thinking<br />the same thing.
3731811 3735148 Actually, I've been thinking it<br />ever since I got here.
3737067 3740070 Why, oh, why didn't I take<br />the blue pill?
3750622 3751873 [COUGHS]
3752457 3754376 Good shit, huh?
3754709 3755919 Dozer makes it.
3756378 3757545 It's good for two things:
3757796 3760882 Degreasing engines and<br />killing brain cells.
3761883 3764094 So can I ask you something?
3767097 3768723 Did he tell you why he did it?
3771351 3773186 Why you're here?
3776856 3778608 Jesus!
3779818 3781736 What a mind job.
3783154 3785949 So you're here to save the world.
3787450 3789536 What do you say<br />to something like that?
3794708 3796084 A little piece of advice.
3797877 3799296 You see an agent...
3799629 3801923 ...you do what we do:
3802257 3803800 Run.
3804134 3805885 You run your ass off.
3813143 3814853 Thanks for the drink.
3819566 3820734 Sweet dreams.
3824738 3828158 SMITH:<br />Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
3828825 3829951 You know...
3831369 3833830 ...I know this steak doesn't exist.
3834831 3837584 I know that when I put it<br />in my mouth...
3837834 3840920 ...the Matrix is telling my brain<br />that it is...
3841212 3842339 ...juicy...
3842630 3844341 ...and delicious.
3847260 3848511 After nine years...
3849554 3851097 ...you know what I realize?
3858938 3860148 Ignorance is bliss.
3865195 3867030 Then we have a deal.
3869532 3871451 I don't want to remember nothing.
3871701 3874204 Nothing. You understand?
3878083 3880085 And I want to be rich.
3881419 3884130 You know, someone important.
3885632 3886758 Like an actor.
3887967 3891096 Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
3893264 3894808 Okay.
3895183 3897602 You get my body<br />back in a power plant...
3897977 3899729 ...reinsert me into the Matrix...
3900063 3901481 ...I'll get you what you want.
3901731 3903733 Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
3903983 3906152 No. I told you, I don't know them.
3909114 3911116 I can get you the man who does.
3911866 3913660 Morpheus.
3923753 3927215 Here you go, buddy.<br />Breakfast of champions.
3928550 3931344 Close your eyes, it feels<br />like you're eating runny eggs.
3931553 3933263 Or a bowl of snot.
3933805 3935390 MOUSE:<br />You know what it reminds me of?
3937225 3939561 Tastee Wheat. Did you<br />ever eat Tastee Wheat?
3940186 3941896 No, but technically,<br />neither did you.
3942147 3944190 That's exactly my point. Exactly.
3944441 3945817 Because you have to wonder...
3946067 3949320 ...how do the machines really know<br />what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
3949571 3950989 Maybe they got it wrong.
3951239 3954451 Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat<br />tasted like, actually tasted like...
3954742 3956744 ...oatmeal or tuna fish.
3957120 3959956 That makes you wonder.<br />Take chicken, for example.
3960206 3962208 Maybe they didn't know<br />what to make it taste like...
3962459 3964502 ...which is why it tastes<br />like everything.
3964752 3966546 - And maybe they...<br />- Shut up.
3968173 3969632 DOZER:<br />It's a single-celled protein...
3969883 3972927 ...combined with synthetic aminos,<br />vitamins and minerals.
3973178 3974429 Everything the body needs.
3974679 3977557 It doesn't have everything<br />the body needs.
3980310 3983396 I understand you've run through<br />the agent training program.
3984439 3986483 You know, I wrote that program.
3986774 3988067 Here it comes.
3988318 3990278 MOUSE: What did you think of her?<br />NEO: Of who?
3990653 3993698 The woman in the red dress.<br />I designed her.
3994032 3996784 She doesn't talk very much...
3997035 4000997 ...but if you'd like to meet her,<br />I can arrange a more personal milieu.
4001247 4002624 The digital pimp hard at work.
4002874 4005126 Pay no attention to<br />these hypocrites, Neo.
4006419 4008254 To deny our own impulses...
4008505 4011633 ...is to deny the very thing<br />that makes us human.
4013551 4014928 Dozer, when you're done...
4015136 4016721 ...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
4017305 4018640 We're going in.
4019349 4020767 I'm taking Neo to see her.
4024687 4025939 See who?
4026940 4028191 The Oracle.
4033696 4035240 Everyone please observe...
4035573 4038284 ...the "fasten seat belt"<br />and "no smoking" signs are on.
4038785 4042163 Sit back and enjoy your flight.
4042413 4044207 [PHONE RINGS]
4066604 4067605 We're in.
4083246 4084414 We'll be back in an hour.
4087917 4090461 [PHONE DIALS, THEN RINGS]
4099178 4101180 MORPHEUS:<br />Unbelievable...
4101431 4102765 ...isn't it?
4106352 4108187 NEO: God!<br />- What?
4108855 4110231 I used to eat there.
4112483 4114110 Really good noodles.
4118906 4121409 I have these memories from my life.
4123870 4125538 None of them happened.
4126247 4127498 What does that mean?
4127749 4129959 That the Matrix cannot tell you<br />who you are.
4130877 4132086 But an oracle can?
4132545 4133755 That's different.
4138468 4139719 Did you go to her?
4141262 4142430 TRINITY:<br />Yes.
4142930 4144307 What did she tell you?
4147560 4149062 She told me...
4150104 4151272 What?
4155068 4156402 MORPHEUS:<br />We're here.
4156778 4159072 Neo, come with me.
4179050 4181469 So is this the same oracle<br />that made...
4181636 4182887 ...the prophecy?
4183137 4187475 Yes. She's very old. She's been<br />with us since the beginning.
4187934 4189936 NEO: The beginning?<br />- Of the Resistance.
4192188 4194565 And she knows what? Everything?
4196609 4198528 She would say she knows enough.
4199654 4201447 And she's never wrong.
4203658 4206828 MORPHEUS: Try not to think of it<br />in terms of right and wrong.
4207161 4208746 She is a guide, Neo.
4209122 4210998 She can help you to find the path.
4211499 4212750 She helped you?
4213459 4214502 Yes.
4215253 4216587 What did she tell you?
4219048 4221259 That I would find the One.
4234397 4236524 I told you I can only<br />show you the door.
4237233 4239318 You have to walk through it.
4243114 4244198 Hello, Neo.
4244449 4246117 You're right on time.
4254041 4257837 Make yourself at home, Morpheus.<br />Neo, come with me.
4263509 4265094 These are the other Potentials.
4265344 4266888 You can wait here.
4307720 4310264 BOY:<br />Do not try and bend the spoon.
4310640 4312767 That's impossible.
4313601 4317605 Instead, only try<br />to realize the truth.
4318147 4319524 What truth?
4319774 4321442 There is no spoon.
4324028 4325363 There is no spoon?
4325613 4330076 Then you'll see that it is not the spoon<br />that bends. It is only yourself.
4346133 4347593 The Oracle will you see now.
4358312 4359856 ORACLE:<br />I know you're Neo.
4360481 4361649 Be right with you.
4362692 4365069 - You're the Oracle?<br />- Bingo.
4367780 4370658 Not quite what you<br />were expecting, right?
4371701 4373870 Almost done.
4376372 4377999 Smell good, don't they?
4379250 4380501 Yeah.
4380751 4382587 ORACLE:<br />I'd ask you to sit down...
4382837 4385214 ...but you're not going to anyway.
4385715 4388593 - And don't worry about the vase.<br />- What vase?
4391721 4392889 That vase.
4393848 4394891 I'm sorry.
4395141 4397018 I said, don't worry about it.
4398185 4400146 I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
4400771 4401981 How did you know?
4404025 4407820 What's really going to bake<br />your noodle later on is...
4408154 4411115 ...would you still have broken it<br />if I hadn't said anything?
4415912 4417830 You're cuter than I thought.
4420875 4423127 I can see why she likes you.
4424003 4425087 Who?
4425338 4427173 Not too bright, though.
4430468 4433554 You know why Morpheus<br />brought you to see me.
4435681 4436849 So...
4437808 4439185 ...what do you think?
4441020 4442772 Do you think you are the One?
4444732 4445775 I don't know.
4449195 4450613 You know what that means?
4451447 4452615 It's Latin.
4452990 4455201 Means, "Know thyself."
4456661 4458621 I'll let you in on a little secret.
4460873 4464710 Being the One is just<br />like being in love.
4465419 4468297 No one can tell you you're in love.<br />You just know it...
4468547 4469674 ...through and through.
4470007 4472051 Balls to bones.
4474387 4475429 Well...
4477390 4479475 ...I'd better have a look at you.
4480810 4482311 Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
4496701 4498369 Okay...
4498995 4503958 Now I'm supposed to say,<br />"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."
4504458 4505584 Then you say:
4506252 4507461 But what?
4507712 4511674 But you already know<br />what I'm going to tell you.
4513092 4516053 - I'm not the One.<br />- Sorry, kid.
4517680 4519682 You got the gift...
4520599 4522893 ...but it looks like<br />you're waiting for something.
4527565 4528607 What?
4528858 4531736 Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
4532319 4534572 That's the way these things go.
4535448 4538034 - What's funny?<br />- Morpheus.
4541495 4543205 He almost had me convinced.
4543456 4544582 I know.
4546125 4548252 Poor Morpheus.
4550629 4553758 Without him, we're lost.
4555301 4557470 What do you mean, "without him"?
4561474 4563392 Are you sure you want<br />to hear this?
4565603 4568355 Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
4570066 4572234 And no one, not you, not even me...
4572485 4574737 ...can convince him otherwise.
4575112 4577490 He believes it so blindly...
4577782 4582119 ...that he's going to sacrifice<br />his life to save yours.
4582328 4583496 What?
4583662 4586332 ORACLE: You're going to<br />have to make a choice.
4586957 4590544 In the one hand,<br />you'll have Morpheus' life.
4591045 4593923 And in the other hand,<br />you'll have your own.
4595341 4597635 One of you is going to die.
4599720 4603015 Which one will be up to you.
4604391 4606310 I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
4606560 4608229 You have a good soul.
4609313 4612024 And I hate giving<br />good people bad news.
4615152 4616612 Don't worry about it.
4616862 4619281 As soon as you<br />step outside that door...
4619532 4621659 ...you'll start feeling better.
4622368 4626163 You'll remember you don't believe<br />in any of this fate crap.
4626997 4629750 You're in control of your own life.
4630584 4631877 Remember?
4633546 4634755 Here...
4636632 4638175 ...take a cookie.
4638717 4642054 I promise, by the time<br />you're done eating it...
4643013 4645391 ...you'll feel right as rain.
4654608 4655943 What was said...
4656569 4658028 ...was for you...
4658571 4660406 ...and for you alone.

4683345 4684430 They're on the way.
4714251 4715294 What is that?
4730059 4731477 Oh, déjà vu.
4734980 4736065 What did you just say?
4736315 4737816 Nothing.<br />Just déjà vu.
4738067 4739693 TRINITY: What did you see?<br />CYPHER: What happened?
4741111 4743280 A black cat went past us...
4743530 4745157 ...then another just like it.
4745407 4746951 Was it the same cat?
4747910 4750746 - I'm not sure.<br />- Switch, Apoc.
4754833 4756043 What is it?
4756293 4760714 A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the<br />Matrix when they change something.
4763676 4764927 Oh, my God.
4766720 4767721 Let's go.
4772977 4774770 They cut the hard line.<br />It's a trap! Get out!
4780234 4781485 Oh, no.
4821775 4824236 CYPHER: That's what they changed.<br />We're trapped.
4824486 4826363 MORPHEUS:<br />Be calm. Give me your phone.
4826613 4828157 TRINITY:<br />They'll be able to track it.
4828407 4829825 MORPHEUS:<br />We have no choice.
4831243 4832453 Operator.
4832786 4835622 MORPHEUS: <i>Find a structural drawing of<br />this building. Find it fast.</i>
4843464 4846050 -Got it!<br />MORPHEUS: <i>I need the main wet-wall.</i>
4848886 4850137 Eighth floor.
4850346 4851930 SMITH:<br /><i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>
4852222 4853682 MORPHEUS:<br />Switch, straight ahead.
4854433 4855601 APOC:<br />Neo...
4861732 4863859 I hope the Oracle<br />gave you some good news.
4872159 4873660 TANK:<br /><i>Now left. That's it.</i>
4873952 4874995 MORPHEUS:<br />Good.
4884713 4886006 Where are they?
4929299 4930342 [COUGHS]
4944690 4946275 [SNEEZES]
4946442 4947609 They're in the walls.
4949069 4950237 COP:<br />In the walls!
4971633 4973302 It's an agent!
4980601 4981935 Morpheus!
4982102 4983353 MORPHEUS:<br />You must get Neo out!
4983604 4985439 He's all that matters!
4985731 4987941 - No, Morpheus! Don't!<br />- Trinity, go!
4988901 4990235 Go!
4996492 4998410 - We can't leave him!<br />- We have to!
5022726 5024520 Cypher, come on!
5029441 5033278 The great Morpheus.<br />We meet at last.
5033820 5034947 And you are?
5035197 5036949 A Smith.
5037199 5038492 Agent Smith.
5039076 5041119 You all look the same to me.
5096758 5098051 Take him.
5104683 5106143 No!
5111273 5113108 -Operator.<br />CYPHER: <i>I need an exit, fast.</i>
5115193 5118113 There was an accident.<br />Goddamn car accident.
5118447 5120240 CYPHER:<br /><i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>
5120490 5121867 Somebody up there still likes me.
5122117 5123368 TANK:<br />I got you.
5123869 5125787 CYPHER:<br /><i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>
5126038 5128707 Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.<br />An old TV repair shop.
5128957 5130000 Right.
5133128 5134713 -Operator.<br />TRINITY: <i>Tank, it's me.</i>
5134963 5136131 Is Morpheus alive?
5136506 5137799 Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
5138216 5140135 <i>Yes. They're moving him.<br />I don't know where.</i>
5140344 5142638 He's alive. We need an exit.
5142888 5143972 You're not far from Cypher.
5144139 5145390 TRINITY: <i>Cypher?</i><br />- I know.
5145641 5147726 <i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i><br />- Got it.
5155525 5156568 [PHONE RINGS]
5156818 5158028 TANK:<br />Got him.
5168955 5169998 Where are they?
5170248 5171500 Making the call.
5172167 5173335 Good.
5174294 5176004 [PHONE RINGS]
5186473 5187724 You first.
5190936 5192145 Shit!
5195440 5197109 Tank!
5197275 5198902 No!
5200821 5202989 I don't know. It just went dead.
5208787 5211415 [PHONE RINGING]
5229808 5231017 CYPHER:<br /><i>Hello, Trinity.</i>
5231435 5232769 Cypher? Where's Tank?
5238358 5239401 You know...
5241111 5243238 ...for a long time...
5244448 5247325 ...I thought I was in love with you.
5248118 5250162 <i>I used to dream about you.</i>
5251246 5253957 You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
5254207 5256585 <i>Too bad things had to<br />turn out this way.</i>
5257127 5258170 You killed them.
5258670 5260172 - What?<br />- Oh, God.
5260422 5261840 I'm tired, Trinity.
5263258 5265135 I'm tired of this war...
5265427 5268263 ...tired of fighting.<br />I'm tired of this ship...
5268597 5273226 ...of being cold, of eating<br />the same goddamn goop every day.
5275437 5276563 But most of all...
5277147 5280525 <i>...I'm tired of that jackoff<br />and all of his bullshit.</i>
5281651 5282944 Surprise, asshole!
5283487 5285697 I bet you never saw this coming...
5285947 5286990 ...did you?
5289284 5291661 God, I wish I could be there...
5292245 5293747 ...when they break you.
5294790 5297959 I wish I could walk in<br />just when it happens...
5298668 5300378 ...so right then...
5300629 5301963 ...you'd know it was me.
5302464 5303632 You gave them Morpheus.
5303882 5305342 <i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>
5305926 5307427 He tricked us!
5307969 5309971 If you had told us the truth...
5310222 5313099 ...we would've told you to shove<br />that red pill up your ass!
5313350 5315477 That is not true, Cypher.<br />He set us free.
5315727 5318605 "Free." You call this free?
5321024 5323527 All I do is what he tells me to do.
5325111 5328031 If I had to choose between<br />that and the Matrix...
5329199 5330408 ...I choose the Matrix.
5330659 5332327 The Matrix isn't real.
5332577 5333995 <i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>
5334246 5336498 I think the Matrix...
5336832 5339417 ...can be more real than this world.
5341586 5344089 All I do is pull the plug here.
5344464 5345674 But there...
5346216 5348510 <i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
5349511 5350762 Trinity.
5356268 5359229 <i>- Welcome to the real world.</i><br />- But you're out, Cypher.
5359479 5361898 <i>- You can't go back.</i><br />- That's what you think.
5362148 5363650 <i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>
5363900 5367529 <i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,<br />I won't remember a thing.</i>
5367737 5368780 By the way...
5369030 5371992 ...if you have anything important<br />to say to Switch...
5372492 5373577 <i>...say it now.</i>
5373827 5376872 - No, please don't.<br />- Not like this.
5378582 5380208 Not like this.
5384671 5385714 Too late.
5386464 5387757 Goddamn you, Cypher!
5388008 5389885 Don't hate me, Trinity.
5390260 5392137 I'm just a messenger.
5392554 5395724 And right now,<br />I'm going to prove it to you.
5396808 5398476 If Morpheus was right...
5399019 5400896 ...there's no way<br />I can pull this plug.
5401479 5402981 <i>If Neo's the One...</i>
5403481 5405317 <i>...then there'd have to be...</i>
5405567 5408153 ...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
5408320 5409529 Right?
5410155 5412240 I mean, how can he be the One...
5412407 5413491 ...if he's dead?
5414868 5417120 <i>You never did answer me before...</i>
5417412 5419748 <i>...if you bought into<br />Morpheus' bullshit.</i>
5420123 5423335 Come on. All I want<br />is a little yes or no.
5424711 5427047 Look into his eyes...
5427797 5429299 <i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>
5432052 5433386 ...and tell me...
5434095 5435347 <i>...yes...</i>
5435680 5437057 <i>...or no.</i>
5438350 5439893 - Yes.<br /><i>- No!</i>
5440060 5441227 I don't believe it.
5442646 5447400 Believe it or not, you piece of shit,<br />you're still going to burn!
5454574 5455825 [PHONE RINGS]
5465669 5467045 You first.
5475261 5477555 - You're hurt.<br />- I'll be all right.
5480350 5481518 Dozer?
5499786 5502163 SMITH:<br />Have you ever stood and stared at it?
5503039 5506167 Marveled at its beauty...
5506543 5508795 ...its genius?
5509963 5511840 Billions of people...
5512090 5514843 ...just living out their lives.
5515885 5517554 Oblivious.
5522142 5525020 Did you know that the first Matrix...
5525270 5529941 ...was designed to be a perfect<br />human world where none suffered...
5530442 5533361 ...where everyone would be happy.
5533903 5535405 It was a disaster.
5535655 5539993 No one would accept the program.<br />Entire crops were lost.
5540869 5542620 Some believe that...
5542871 5547250 ...we lacked the programming language<br />to describe your perfect world.
5547500 5549044 But I believe that...
5549210 5550378 ...as a species...
5550628 5554466 ...human beings define<br />their reality through misery...
5554716 5556092 ...and suffering.
5556342 5559054 So the perfect world was a dream...
5559304 5564142 ...that your primitive cerebrum<br />kept trying to wake up from.
5565477 5569147 Which is why the Matrix was<br />redesigned to this.
5569606 5571107 The peak...
5571357 5572776 ...of your civilization.
5573026 5575278 I say, "your civilization"...
5575528 5579657 ...because when we started thinking<br />for you, it became our civilization...
5579908 5582994 ...which is, of course,<br />what this is all about.
5584329 5586915 Evolution, Morpheus.
5587207 5588541 Evolution.
5590835 5592712 Like the dinosaur.
5594881 5596508 Look out that window.
5597217 5599344 You had your time.
5600053 5603973 The future is our world, Morpheus.
5604307 5606684 The future is our time.
5610939 5612107 There could be a problem.
5613024 5616402 NEO: What are they doing to him?<br />- They're breaking into his mind.
5616653 5618822 It's like hacking a computer.<br />All it takes is time.
5619072 5620281 How much time?
5620532 5623660 Depends on the mind.<br />But eventually, it'll crack...
5623910 5628331 ...and his alpha patterns<br />will change from this to this.
5628581 5631543 When it does, he'll tell them<br />anything they want to know.
5631793 5632836 What do they want?
5633086 5637132 The leader of every ship is given<br />codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
5637382 5640301 If an agent got the codes<br />and got into Zion's mainframe...
5640552 5643638 ...they could destroy us.<br />We can't let that happen.
5643805 5646057 Trinity, Zion's more important than me...
5646224 5647392 ...or you...
5647559 5648852 ...or even Morpheus.
5652647 5654315 There has to be<br />something we can do.
5654732 5656734 There is. We pull the plug.
5659821 5661573 You're going to kill him?
5661823 5662991 Kill Morpheus?
5663616 5665243 We don't have a choice.
5672041 5674961 Never send a human<br />to do a machine's job.
5675211 5676963 If the insider has failed...
5677213 5680425 ...they'll sever the connection<br />as soon as possible, unless...
5680675 5682385 They're dead. In either case...
5682635 5686181 We have no choice. Continue as planned.<br />Deploy the sentinels.
5686431 5687515 Immediately.
5692770 5695440 Morpheus, you were more<br />than a leader to us.
5696399 5698610 You were a father.
5700153 5702113 We'll miss you always.
5708995 5710205 Stop!
5711372 5712707 I don't believe this is happening.
5712874 5714918 -Neo, this has to be done.<br />NEO: Does it?
5715710 5717086 I don't know.
5717420 5719881 - This can't be just coincidence.<br />- What?
5720089 5721341 NEO:<br />The Oracle.
5721591 5723384 She told me this would happen.
5723801 5727972 She told me that I would<br />have to make a choice.
5728431 5729641 What choice?
5732644 5735146 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm going in.
5735480 5737815 TRINITY: No, you're not.<br />- I have to.
5738024 5741653 Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself<br />so that we could get you out.
5741903 5743821 There is no way<br />that you're going back in.
5744405 5747659 Morpheus did what he did because<br />he believed I'm something I'm not.
5749160 5750203 What?
5750912 5752538 I'm not the One, Trinity.
5752914 5755875 - The Oracle hit me with that too.<br />- No, you have to be.
5756125 5758795 I'm sorry, I'm not.<br />I'm just another guy.
5759462 5760713 No, Neo, that's not true.
5761297 5763925 - It can't be true.<br />- Why?
5768346 5771683 This is loco. They've got Morpheus<br />in a military-controlled building.
5771933 5776312 Even if you somehow got inside, those<br />are agents holding him. Three of them.
5777605 5781526 I want Morpheus back too, but<br />what you're talking about is suicide.
5781776 5783361 That's what it looks like...
5783528 5784570 ...but it's not.
5784821 5787198 I can't explain to you why it's not.
5788283 5791995 Morpheus believed something, and<br />he was ready to give his life for it.
5792245 5795248 I understand that now.<br />That's why I have to go.
5795540 5798042 - Why?<br />- Because I believe in something.
5798209 5799836 What?
5800545 5802255 I believe I can bring him back.
5819230 5821149 - What are you doing?<br />- Going with you.
5821441 5823443 - No, you're not.<br />- "No"?
5824610 5826738 Let me tell you what I believe.
5827238 5829615 Morpheus means more to me<br />than he does to you.
5829949 5834245 I believe if you are serious about<br />saving him, you will need my help.
5834495 5836539 And since I am the ranking officer...
5836789 5839667 ...if you don't like it,<br />I believe you can go to hell.
5840418 5842837 Because you aren't going anywhere else.
5843254 5844797 Tank...
5844964 5846090 ...load us up.
5855725 5859020 I'd like to share<br />a revelation that I've had...
5859437 5860980 ...during my time here.
5861230 5865234 It came to me when I tried<br />to classify your species...
5865485 5867737 ...and I realized...
5867987 5870281 ...that you're not actually mammals.
5872492 5874952 Every mammal on this planet...
5875286 5880208 ...instinctively develops an equilibrium<br />with the surrounding environment.
5880458 5882293 But you humans do not.
5882835 5886381 You move to an area<br />and you multiply...
5886631 5891135 ...and multiply until every<br />natural resource is consumed.
5891469 5893554 The only way you can survive...
5893846 5896808 ...is to spread to another area.
5902230 5905108 There is another organism<br />on this planet...
5905358 5907318 ...that follows the same pattern.
5907944 5909612 Do you know what it is?
5909987 5911823 A virus.
5913157 5916202 Human beings are a disease.
5916577 5918121 A cancer of this planet.
5918371 5920498 You are a plague.
5921040 5922458 And we...
5922625 5924001 ...are the cure.
5925002 5926421 Okay, so what do you need?
5927046 5928172 Besides a miracle.
5928756 5929966 Guns.
5930800 5932009 Lots of guns.
5941894 5943104 Neo...
5944856 5947400 No one has ever done<br />anything like this.
5948609 5950528 That's why it's going to work.
5954615 5956534 Why isn't the serum working?
5957160 5959454 Perhaps we're asking<br />the wrong questions.
5961539 5962790 Leave me with him.
5965376 5966502 Now.
5977722 5979307 TANK:<br />Hold on, Morpheus.
5979557 5982268 They're coming for you.<br />They're coming.
5984645 5986772 SMITH:<br />Can you hear me, Morpheus?
5987023 5989692 I'm going to be honest...
5990067 5991277 ...with you.
5995656 5997074 I...
5997950 5999076 ...hate...
5999327 6001287 ...this place...
6001621 6003915 ...this zoo...
6004165 6005291 ...this prison...
6005541 6008711 ...this reality,<br />whatever you want to call it.
6008961 6011255 I can't stand it any longer.
6012006 6013883 It's the smell.
6015259 6017136 If there is such a thing.
6017470 6020765 I feel saturated by it.
6022266 6023559 I can...
6023809 6025353 ...taste...
6025520 6027563 ...your stink.
6027813 6031442 And every time I do, I fear that<br />I have somehow been infected by it.
6031609 6032610 It's repulsive.
6033611 6034987 Isn't it?
6037156 6039450 I must get out of here.
6039867 6042078 I must get free.
6042328 6045206 And in this mind is the key.
6045456 6047124 My key.
6047375 6050253 Once Zion is destroyed,<br />there is no need for me to be here.
6050503 6052129 Do you understand?
6052421 6053798 I need the codes.
6054048 6056384 I have to get inside Zion...
6056717 6059220 ...and you have to tell me how.
6059637 6061514 You're going to tell me...
6061764 6063933 ...or you're going to die.
6084120 6087248 Please remove any metallic items<br />you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
6091168 6092211 Holy shit!
6104307 6107018 Backup. Send backup.

6266802 6268012 What were you doing?
6269847 6271140 He doesn't know.
6271390 6272892 Know what?
6300961 6303464 I think they're trying to save him.
6318312 6320064 There is no spoon.
6349677 6351846 Find them and destroy them!
6353472 6355307 We're under attack!
6387423 6388591 Trinity!
6389091 6390175 Help!
6412197 6413407 Only human.
6414366 6415451 Dodge this.
6428672 6430174 - How did you do that?<br />- Do what?
6430591 6434511 You moved like they do.<br />I've never seen anyone move that fast.
6435638 6437014 It wasn't fast enough.
6439767 6441060 Can you fly that thing?
6442186 6443187 Not yet.
6446482 6447524 Operator.

6477304 6478389 No.
6529982 6532609 Morpheus, get up.<br />Get up, get up.
6570647 6571690 He's not going to make it.
6581492 6582534 Got you.
6648600 6649768 Trinity!
6691435 6692853 I knew it.
6693478 6694688 He's the One.
6710662 6712873 Do you believe it now, Trinity?
6715751 6716919 Morpheus...
6718587 6719671 The Oracle.
6720923 6723300 - She told me...<br />- She told you...
6723675 6725260 ...what you needed to hear.
6725552 6726887 That's all.
6727930 6730891 Sooner or later you'll realize,<br />just as I did...
6731225 6733518 ...there's a difference<br />between knowing the path...
6734269 6735562 ...and walking the path.
6738607 6739816 -Operator.<br />MORPHEUS: <i>Tank.</i>
6740734 6743278 - It's good to hear your voice.<br /><i>- We need an exit.</i>
6743528 6746323 Got one ready. Subway station,<br />State and Balboa.
6759378 6761797 - Damn it!<br />- The trace was completed.
6762047 6765634 - We have their position.<br />- Sentinels are standing by.
6767344 6768845 Order the strike.

6788573 6789908 You first, Morpheus.
6810595 6812889 Neo, I want to tell you something...

6858727 6859895 Neo!
6860145 6861772 -What happened?<br />TRINITY: An agent.

6870155 6871531 Run, Neo. Run.
6876828 6878455 What is he doing?
6878705 6879956 He's beginning to believe.
6906942 6908318 You're empty.
6908902 6910195 So are you.
6943353 6946356 I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
6947482 6948525 ...Mr. Anderson.
6989483 6991568 Jesus, he's killing him.
7077737 7079864 You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
7080615 7083618 That is the sound of inevitability.
7086204 7089541 It is the sound of your death.
7090458 7092794 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7093044 7094671 My name...
7097674 7099718 ...is Neo.

7152312 7154564 - How long?<br />- Five, maybe six minutes.
7156608 7158777 Tank, charge the EMP.
7159027 7162072 -We can't use that until he's out.<br />MORPHEUS: I know. Don't worry.
7163239 7164324 He's gonna make it.
7164574 7166451 Flat or pumps? No, just...
7166701 7169579 What the shit? That's my phone!
7169996 7171581 That guy took my phone!

7437096 7438139 Neo...
7439599 7441559 I'm not afraid anymore.
7443186 7444520 The Oracle told me...
7444687 7450109 ...I'd fall in love, and that<br />the man I loved would be the One.
7453237 7455198 So you see...
7455907 7457909 ...you can't be dead.
7459494 7461329 You can't be...
