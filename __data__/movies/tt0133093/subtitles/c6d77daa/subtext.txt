611111 612195 Hello, Neo.
613530 614697 How do you know that name?
615532 617241 I know a lot about you.
618118 620203 - Who are you?<br />- My name is Trinity.
621163 622371 Trinity.
623999 625166 The Trinity?
625626 627335 That cracked the IRS D-base?
627586 629045 That was a long time ago.
629296 631214 - Jesus.<br />- What?
631673 633466 I just thought...
635219 636385 ...you were a guy.
636637 638095 Most guys do.
639306 641516 That was you on my computer.
642142 643226 How did you do that?
643894 646604 Right now, all I can tell you...
647231 648773 ...is that you're in danger.
649233 651651 - TRINITY: I brought you here to warn you.<br />- Of what?
652236 653903 They're watching you, Neo.

670796 673130 ...you sit at your computer.
674299 675842 You're looking for him.
676635 679637 I know, because I was once<br />looking for the same thing.
680138 682265 And when he found me...
682891 685977 ...he told me I wasn't really<br />looking for him...
686895 688646 ...I was looking for an answer.
689273 692400 It's the question that drives us, Neo.

1069861 1074698 As you can see, we've had our eye on<br />you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
1075992 1078661 It seems that you've been living...
1078912 1081038 ...two lives.
1082457 1084959 In one life,<br />you're Thomas A. Anderson...
1085210 1088545 ...program writer for<br />a respectable software company.
1089589 1092883 You have a social security number.<br />You pay your taxes.
1093343 1094593 And you...
1096179 1099807 ...help your landlady<br />carry out her garbage.
1102310 1105437 The other life is lived in computers...
1105730 1108691 ...where you go by<br />the hacker alias "Neo"...
1108942 1113737 ...and are guilty of virtually every<br />computer crime we have a law for.
1115031 1116991 One of these lives...
1117242 1119076 ...has a future.
1119411 1121412 And one of them does not.
1125125 1128961 I'm going to be as forthcoming<br />as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
1129963 1131297 You're here...
1131631 1133882 ...because we need your help.
1137512 1140514 We know that you've been contacted<br />by a certain...
1140765 1142558 ...individual.
1143476 1147521 A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
1148523 1152526 Whatever you think you know<br />about this man is irrelevant.
1152777 1155195 He is considered by many authorities...
1155447 1158490 ...to be the most dangerous man alive.
1161202 1162411 My colleagues...
1162871 1165789 ...believe that I am wasting<br />my time with you.
1166082 1169501 But I believe you wish<br />to do the right thing.
1169794 1173297 We're willing to wipe the slate clean...

1194527 1196528 ...I give you the finger...
1199115 1201116 ...and you give me my phone call.
1203328 1205162 Mr. Anderson...
1209334 1210376 ...you disappoint me.

1565982 1568483 Please, come. Sit.
1583583 1585208 I imagine...
1585626 1588378 ...that right now you're feeling<br />a bit like Alice...
1590089 1592507 ...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
1593342 1594426 You could say that.

1602101 1604352 ...because he's expecting to wake up.

1611611 1612694 No.
1613112 1614154 Why not?

1633549 1635133 But you feel it.
1635718 1637636 You felt it your entire life:
1638221 1642390 Something's wrong with the world.<br />You don't know what, but it's there.
1642892 1645101 Like a splinter in your mind...
1645353 1647229 ...driving you mad.
1648147 1650899 It is this feeling<br />that has brought you to me.
1653444 1655278 Do you know what<br />I'm talking about?
1657114 1658448 The Matrix?
1660952 1662619 Do you want to know...
1663079 1665080 ...what it is?
1667458 1669334 The Matrix is everywhere.
1669585 1671294 It is all around us.
1671546 1673505 Even now, in this very room.
1674340 1676550 You can see it when you<br />look out your window...
1676801 1679135 ...or when you turn on your television.
1679554 1682097 You can feel it when you go to work...
1683641 1685308 ...when you go to church...
1685726 1687811 ...when you pay your taxes.
1688938 1691857 It is the world that has been<br />pulled over your eyes...
1692108 1693692 ...to blind you from the truth.
1695903 1697153 What truth?
1701409 1702951 That you are a slave.
1704453 1706746 Like everyone else,<br />you were born into bondage...
1706998 1711668 ...born into a prison that you cannot<br />smell or taste or touch.
1711961 1713253 A prison...
1713504 1714629 ...for your mind.
1721637 1723972 Unfortunately, no one can be...
1724307 1726683 ...told what the Matrix is.
1730146 1732022 You have to see it for yourself.
1741532 1743825 This is your last chance.
1744076 1746411 After this, there is no turning back.
1746871 1748330 You take the blue pill...
1748664 1751708 ...the story ends, you wake up<br />in your bed and believe...
1751959 1753752 ...whatever you want to believe.
1754003 1755337 You take the red pill...
1755588 1757547 ...you stay in Wonderland...
1758049 1760759 ...and I show you how deep<br />the rabbit hole goes.
1770645 1771853 Remember...
1772688 1775732 ...all I'm offering is the truth.<br />Nothing more.
1790040 1791374 Follow me.
1793919 1795586 Apoc, are we on-line?
1795837 1797213 APOC:<br />Almost.
1800550 1802593 MORPHEUS:<br />Time is always against us.
1802970 1804470 Please take a seat there.
1822656 1824365 - You did all this?<br />- TRINITY: Mm-hm.
1828495 1830496 The pill you took is<br />part of a trace program.
1831248 1835876 It disrupts your carrier signals<br />so we can pinpoint your location.
1836420 1837461 What does that mean?
1838046 1840214 It means buckle your<br />seat belt, Dorothy...
1840549 1841882 ...because Kansas...
1842134 1843175 ...is going bye-bye.
1881089 1882465 Did you...?
1893477 1897563 Have you ever had a dream, Neo,<br />that you were so sure was real?
1899024 1901609 What if you were unable<br />to wake from that dream?
1901860 1904361 How would you know the difference<br />between the dream world...
1904988 1906405 ...and the real world?
1908033 1909200 NEO:<br />This can't be.
1909367 1910409 MORPHEUS:<br />Be what?
1911119 1912620 Be real?
1916583 1918000 - Going into replication.<br />- Apoc?
1918210 1919210 Still nothing.
1919795 1921003 NEO:<br />It's cold.
1921254 1922630 It's cold!
1926510 1928177 Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
1929679 1932348 - I got a fibrillation.<br />- Apoc, location.
1932599 1934058 APOC:<br />Targeting almost there.
1937354 1938771 He's going into arrest.
1939022 1941524 - Lock. I got him!<br />- Now, Tank, now!
2118785 2119868 Welcome...
2120203 2122121 ...to the real world.
2123540 2125374 MORPHEUS:<br />We've done it, Trinity.
2125625 2127167 We found him.
2127419 2130212 - I hope you're right.<br />- MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.
2130797 2132381 I know it.
2137554 2138595 Am I dead?
2139097 2141265 Far from it.
2155238 2156655 He still needs a lot of work.
2158199 2159283 What are you doing?
2159534 2161744 Your muscles atrophied.<br />We're rebuilding them.
2162329 2163871 Why do my eyes hurt?
2164581 2166457 You've never used them before.
2170211 2171253 Rest, Neo.
2171504 2173172 The answers are coming.
2243827 2245411 (DOOR OPENS)
2247747 2249331 Morpheus, what's happened to me?
2249958 2251041 What is this place?
2251292 2253961 More important than "what" is "when."
2254462 2255504 "When"?
2255713 2257756 You believe it's the year 1999...
2258007 2260259 ...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.
2261386 2264138 I can't tell you exactly<br />what year it is...
2264389 2266014 ...because we honestly don't know.
2266516 2269351 There's nothing I can say<br />that will explain it for you.
2269602 2272354 Come with me.<br />See for yourself.
2272897 2274648 MORPHEUS:<br />This is my ship.
2274941 2277860 <i>The Nebuchadnezzar.<br />It's a hovercraft.</i>
2280697 2282448 This is the main deck.
2288204 2289455 This is the core...
2291958 2295711 ...where we broadcast our pirate signal<br />and hack into the Matrix.
2299090 2302259 Most of my crew you already know.
2307265 2308682 This is Apoc...
2309476 2310809 ...Switch...
2312395 2313562 - ...and Cypher.<br />- Hi.
2313813 2317524 The ones you don't know:<br />Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
2318401 2320819 The little one behind you is Mouse.
2325158 2328410 You wanted to know<br />what the Matrix is?
2329454 2330662 Trinity.
2351684 2353268 Try to relax.
2358149 2359983 This will feel a little weird.
2371955 2373330 This...
2373498 2375207 ...is the Construct.
2375625 2377751 It's our loading program.
2378002 2380462 We can load anything, from clothing...
2380713 2382089 ...to equipment...
2382382 2383715 ...weapons...
2384342 2386176 ...training simulations...
2386553 2389096 ...anything we need.
2391891 2394309 NEO: Right now we're inside<br />a computer program?
2394602 2396520 Is it really so hard to believe?
2397021 2399648 Your clothes are different.<br />The plugs in your body are gone.
2400858 2402943 Your hair has changed.
2403319 2406655 Your appearance now is what we call<br />"residual self-image."
2407365 2409992 It is the mental projection<br />of your digital self.
2415873 2416999 This isn't real?
2417250 2418792 What is "real"?
2419168 2421420 How do you define "real"?
2421713 2423630 If you're talking about<br />what you can feel...
2423881 2426300 ...what you can smell, taste and see...
2426551 2430429 ...then "real" is simply electrical<br />signals interpreted by your brain.
2434601 2437019 This is the world that you know.
2438438 2441481 The world as it was at the end<br />of the 20th century.
2443860 2448196 It exists now only as part of<br />a neural-interactive simulation...
2448448 2449698 ...that we call the Matrix.
2454245 2457039 You've been living<br />in a dream world, Neo.
2458041 2459166 This is the world...
2459459 2461209 ...as it exists today.
2474265 2477225 Welcome to "the desert...
2478102 2479686 ...of the real."
2483066 2485442 We have only bits and pieces<br />of information.
2485693 2489488 But what we know for certain<br />is that in the early 21st century...
2489739 2492991 ...all of mankind was united<br />in celebration.
2493242 2497996 We marveled at our own magnificence<br />as we gave birth to AI.
2498790 2499915 AI.
2500958 2502334 You mean artificial intelligence.
2502585 2507005 A singular consciousness that spawned<br />an entire race of machines.
2507840 2511301 We don't know who struck first,<br />us or them.
2511719 2514930 But we know that it was us<br />that scorched the sky.
2516599 2518767 They were dependent on solar power...
2519018 2522354 ...and it was believed that<br />they would be unable to survive...
2522689 2526191 ...without an energy source<br />as abundant as the sun.
2526442 2531321 Throughout human history, we have<br />been dependent on machines to survive.
2532782 2536993 Fate, it seems, is not<br />without a sense of irony.
2540206 2544626 The human body generates more<br />bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
2544877 2549005 And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
2550925 2553093 Combined with a form of fusion...
2553428 2558265 ...the machines had found all the energy<br />they would ever need.
2562311 2566064 There are fields, Neo,<br />endless fields...
2566315 2569568 ...where human beings<br />are no longer born.
2570278 2572112 We are grown.
2578161 2580746 For the longest time,<br />I wouldn't believe it.
2580997 2583665 And then I saw the fields<br />with my own eyes...
2585001 2586626 ...watched them liquefy the dead...
2586878 2590213 ...so they could be fed intravenously<br />to the living.
2590757 2595010 And standing there,<br />facing the pure, horrifying precision...
2595261 2598180 ...I came to realize<br />the obviousness of the truth.
2600808 2602601 What is the Matrix?
2603811 2604853 Control.
2606230 2609608 The Matrix is a computer-generated<br />dream world...
2610401 2613487 ...built to keep us under control...
2614655 2617824 ...in order to change a human being...
2618451 2619618 ...into this.
2620995 2622120 No.
2623748 2625332 I don't believe it.
2625708 2626917 It's not possible.
2627502 2632088 I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.<br />I just said it would be the truth.
2632340 2633632 Stop!
2634175 2635383 Let me out!
2636093 2638011 Let me out! I want out!
2639972 2642641 - Easy, Neo. Easy.<br />- Get this thing out of me.
2642892 2644559 Get this thing out of me!
2646354 2647854 Don't touch me!
2648105 2649731 Stay away from me!
2650149 2651650 I don't believe it.
2652360 2653568 I don't believe it.
2653820 2655320 I don't believe it.
2655571 2657614 - He's gonna pop.<br />- Breathe, Neo.
2657990 2659074 Just breathe.
2677468 2679261 I can't go back, can I?
2680096 2681513 No.
2682348 2683557 But if you could...
2684392 2685892 ...would you really want to?
2688396 2689771 I owe you an apology.
2690356 2691731 We have a rule.
2692191 2695443 We never free a mind<br />once it's reached a certain age.
2695611 2696695 It's dangerous.
2697405 2699114 The mind has trouble letting go.
2699365 2701658 I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
2702702 2704786 I did what I did because...
2705496 2706955 ...I had to.
2715381 2719467 When the Matrix was first built,<br />there was a man born inside...
2719969 2723763 ...who had the ability<br />to change whatever he wanted...
2724140 2727058 ...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
2728811 2732272 It was he who freed the first of us...
2733149 2734774 ...taught us the truth.
2736235 2739321 As long as the Matrix exists...
2739655 2741740 ...the human race will never be free.
2745953 2747495 After he died...
2748247 2750957 ...the Oracle prophesied his return...
2751500 2754711 ...and that his coming would hail<br />the destruction of the Matrix...
2754962 2756630 ...end the war...
2756964 2758214 ...bring freedom to our people.
2759550 2764179 That is why there are those of us who<br />spent our lives searching the Matrix...
2764513 2766097 ...looking for him.
2768517 2770602 I did what I did because...
2772229 2774356 ...I believe that search is over.
2779445 2780862 Get some rest.
2781489 2783281 You're going to need it.
2785993 2787035 For what?
2790081 2791289 Your training.
2809600 2811309 Morning. Did you sleep?
2812186 2813395 You will tonight.
2813771 2815313 I guarantee it.
2816816 2818733 I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
2819193 2821611 - You don't have any...<br />- Holes? Nope.
2822530 2827242 Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%<br />pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
2827493 2828702 Born free right here...
2829245 2830578 ...in the real world.
2830830 2832497 Genuine child of Zion.
2833332 2835792 - Zion?<br />- If the war was over tomorrow...
2836043 2837544 ...Zion's where the party would be.
2837962 2839254 It's a city?
2839505 2842674 The last human city.<br />The only place we have left.
2844260 2845510 Where is it?
2847263 2850682 Deep underground near the Earth's core,<br />where it's still warm.
2852309 2854185 You live long enough,<br />you might see it.
2856439 2861276 Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited<br />to see what you're capable of...
2861527 2863278 ...if Morpheus is right and all.
2863779 2866531 We're not supposed to<br />talk about this, but...
2866782 2868199 ...if you are...
2869285 2871286 ...it's a very exciting time.
2872329 2875040 We got a lot to do.<br />We gotta get to it.
2878961 2881880 We're supposed to start<br />with these programs first.
2882882 2886342 That's major boring shit.<br />Let's do something more fun.
2886677 2888136 How about...
2889722 2891473 ...combat training?
2897521 2898980 "Jujitsu"?
2899857 2901524 I'm going to learn jujitsu?
2912870 2914079 Holy shit!
2914330 2916664 "Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
2916999 2918291 How about some more?
2918542 2919834 Hell, yes.
2921921 2922962 Hell, yeah.
2935142 2936226 How is he?
2936477 2938645 Ten hours straight.<br />He's a machine.
2949865 2951241 I know kung fu.
2952910 2953910 Show me.
2955704 2957455 This is a sparring program...
2957706 2960500 ...similar to the programmed reality<br />of the Matrix.
2960751 2963086 It has the same basic rules.<br />Like gravity.
2963337 2966798 These rules are no different<br />than those of a computer system.
2967341 2968842 Some of them can be bent.
2969051 2971511 Others can be broken.
2972054 2973138 Understand?
2974223 2975265 Then hit me...
2975850 2976975 ...if you can.
3015973 3017015 Good!
3017766 3018933 Adaptation.
3019226 3020435 Improvisation.
3020728 3022061 But your weakness...
3022313 3023688 ...is not your technique.
3030654 3032739 Morpheus is fighting Neo.
3105020 3106187 How did I beat you?
3112778 3113861 You're too fast.
3114405 3115738 Do you believe that...
3116115 3118616 ...my being stronger or faster...
3118867 3122537 ...has anything to do<br />with my muscles in this place?
3126583 3128376 You think you're breathing air?
3141890 3143099 Again!
3154570 3156988 Jesus Christ, he's fast!
3157239 3159449 His neuro-kinetics<br />are way above normal.
3164913 3166372 What are you waiting for?
3166623 3168583 You're faster than this.
3170794 3173004 Don't think you are.
3173255 3174922 Know you are.
3185309 3188102 Come on! Stop trying to hit me,<br />and hit me!
3198030 3199781 I don't believe it.
3201325 3203451 I know what you're trying to do.
3205120 3207288 I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
3207623 3209707 But I can only show you the door.
3210292 3212126 You have to walk through it.
3214505 3216631 Tank, load the jump program.
3228227 3230937 You have to let it all go, Neo.<br />Fear...
3231480 3233648 ...doubt and disbelief.
3234817 3237527 Free your mind.
3245786 3246911 Whoa.
3253710 3255420 Okey-dokey.
3257506 3258673 Free my mind.
3259133 3260258 What if he makes it?
3260509 3263219 - No one's ever made their first jump.<br />- MOUSE: I know.
3264555 3267014 - But what if he does?<br />- He won't.
3267599 3268683 Come on.
3268934 3270101 All right.
3270561 3272603 No problem. Free my mind.
3273397 3276190 Free my mind. No problem. Right.
3295586 3297253 What does that mean?
3297629 3299464 It doesn't mean anything.
3300048 3302633 Everybody falls the first time.
3303093 3304385 Right, Trin?
3325073 3327700 - I thought it wasn't real.<br />- Your mind makes it real.
3330954 3333206 If you're killed in the Matrix...
3333373 3334415 ...you die here?
3335042 3337502 The body cannot live without the mind.
3367991 3371369 I don't remember you ever<br />bringing me dinner.
3374456 3377291 There is something about him,<br />isn't there?
3377918 3379544 You're a believer now?
3380546 3381754 I keep wondering...
3382005 3385675 ...if Morpheus is so sure,<br />why not take him to see the Oracle?
3386593 3389512 Morpheus will take him<br />when he's ready.
3399314 3400856 The Matrix is a system, Neo.
3402609 3403901 That system is our enemy.
3404528 3406862 But when you're inside,<br />what do you see?
3407114 3410908 Businessmen, teachers,<br />lawyers, carpenters.
3411368 3413953 The very minds of the people<br />we are trying to save.
3414204 3417164 But until we do, these people are<br />a part of that system...
3417416 3419333 ...and that makes them our enemy.
3419501 3420710 You have to understand...
3420961 3424297 ...most of these people are not<br />ready to be unplugged.
3424548 3426132 And many of them are so inert...
3426383 3428801 ...so hopelessly dependent<br />on the system...
3429052 3431762 ...that they will fight to protect it.
3433265 3437018 Were you listening to me or looking<br />at the woman in the red dress?
3437185 3438936 - I was...<br />- Look again.
3440188 3441272 Freeze it.
3447904 3449530 NEO: This isn't the Matrix?<br />MORPHEUS: No.
3451325 3455161 It's another training program<br />designed to teach you one thing:
3455787 3458205 If you are not one of us,<br />you are one of them.
3458749 3461542 - What are they?<br />- Sentient programs.
3462294 3466589 They can move in and out of any<br />software still hardwired to their system.
3466965 3470343 That means that anyone<br />we haven't unplugged...
3470677 3472011 ...is potentially an agent.
3472971 3474805 Inside the Matrix...
3475390 3477099 ...they are everyone...
3477434 3479143 ...and they are no one.
3479394 3482521 We have survived by hiding<br />and running from them...
3482773 3484398 ...but they are the gatekeepers.
3484650 3487610 They're guarding all the doors<br />and holding all the keys.
3487861 3490696 Sooner or later, someone will<br />have to fight them.
3490864 3492073 Someone?
3492407 3493824 MORPHEUS:<br />I won't lie to you, Neo.
3494284 3499121 Every single man or woman who<br />has fought an agent, has died.
3499373 3501749 But where they have failed,<br />you will succeed.
3501917 3503000 Why?
3503251 3505544 MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch<br />through a concrete wall.
3505796 3509382 Men have emptied entire clips at them<br />and hit nothing but air.
3509633 3514261 Yet their strength and speed are still<br />based in a world built on rules.
3514513 3515638 Because of that...
3515889 3519266 ...they will never be as strong<br />or as fast as you can be.
3523563 3525439 What are you telling me?
3526149 3527608 That I can dodge bullets?
3529611 3530986 No, Neo.
3531488 3534407 I'm trying to tell you<br />that when you're ready...
3535283 3536617 ...you won't have to.
3537953 3539453 (PHONE RINGS)
3540747 3541956 <i>TANK:<br />We got trouble.</i>
3560892 3563352 - Did Zion send the warning?<br />- No, another ship.
3566606 3567898 Shit.
3568150 3571026 - Squiddy's sweeping in quick.<br />- Squiddy?
3571236 3574447 A sentinel. A killing machine<br />designed for one thing.
3574698 3575906 Search and destroy.
3577242 3578409 Set her down there.
3599681 3601182 How are we doing, Tank?
3609900 3611066 Power off-line.
3611568 3613527 EMP armed...
3614070 3615613 - ...and ready.<br />- EMP?
3615906 3617782 Electromagnetic pulse.
3618033 3620910 Disables any electrical system<br />in the blast radius.
3621077 3623370 It's the only weapon we have<br />against the machines.
3629169 3632296 - NEO: Where are we?<br />- Their old service and waste systems.
3633548 3634673 Sewers.
3634883 3637593 TRINITY: There used to be cities<br />that spanned hundreds of miles.
3638094 3640012 Now these sewers are<br />all that's left.
3640263 3641597 Quiet.
3682180 3683639 Whoa! Neo.
3685475 3687643 You scared the bejesus out of me.
3688728 3690646 - Sorry.<br />- It's okay.
3693149 3694400 Is that...?
3694651 3696235 The Matrix?
3696403 3697611 Yeah.
3699406 3702575 - Do you always look at it encoded?<br />- Well, you have to.
3702826 3705911 The image translators work<br />for the construct program.
3706162 3709582 But there's way too much information<br />to decode the Matrix.
3709833 3712793 You get used to it.<br />I don't even see the code.
3713044 3716463 All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
3717632 3719008 Do you...
3719301 3720384 ...want a drink?
3720635 3721677 Sure.
3725223 3726682 You know...
3727601 3729143 ...I know what you're thinking.
3729394 3731478 Because right now I'm thinking<br />the same thing.
3731813 3735149 Actually, I've been thinking it<br />ever since I got here.
3737068 3740070 Why, oh, why didn't I take<br />the blue pill?
3750624 3751874 (COUGHS)
3752459 3754376 Good shit, huh?
3754711 3755920 Dozer makes it.
3756379 3757546 It's good for two things:
3757797 3760883 Degreasing engines and<br />killing brain cells.
3761885 3764094 So can I ask you something?
3767098 3768724 Did he tell you why he did it?
3771353 3773187 Why you're here?
3776858 3778609 Jesus!
3779819 3781737 What a mind job.
3783156 3785950 So you're here to save the world.
3787452 3789536 What do you say<br />to something like that?
3794709 3796085 A little piece of advice.
3797879 3799296 You see an agent...
3799631 3801924 ...you do what we do:
3802258 3803801 Run.
3804135 3805886 You run your ass off.
3813144 3814853 Thanks for the drink.
3819567 3820734 Sweet dreams.
3824739 3828158 SMITH:<br />Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
3828827 3829952 You know...
3831371 3833831 ...I know this steak doesn't exist.
3834833 3837584 I know that when I put it<br />in my mouth...
3837836 3840921 ...the Matrix is telling my brain<br />that it is...
3841214 3842339 ...juicy...
3842632 3844341 ...and delicious.
3847262 3848512 After nine years...
3849556 3851098 ...you know what I realize?
3858940 3860149 Ignorance is bliss.
3865196 3867031 Then we have a deal.
3869534 3871452 I don't want to remember nothing.
3871703 3874204 Nothing. You understand?
3878084 3880085 And I want to be rich.
3881421 3884131 You know, someone important.
3885633 3886759 Like an actor.
3887969 3891096 Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
3893266 3894808 Okay.
3895185 3897603 You get my body<br />back in a power plant...
3897979 3899730 ...reinsert me into the Matrix...
3900065 3901482 ...I'll get you what you want.
3901733 3903734 Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
3903985 3906153 No. I told you, I don't know them.
3909115 3911116 I can get you the man who does.
3911868 3913660 Morpheus.
3923755 3927216 Here you go, buddy.<br />Breakfast of champions.
3928551 3931345 Close your eyes, it feels<br />like you're eating runny eggs.
3931554 3933263 Or a bowl of snot.
3933807 3935390 MOUSE:<br />You know what it reminds me of?
3937227 3939561 Tastee Wheat. Did you<br />ever eat Tastee Wheat?
3940188 3941897 No, but technically,<br />neither did you.
3942148 3944191 That's exactly my point. Exactly.
3944442 3945818 Because you have to wonder...
3946069 3949321 ...how do the machines really know<br />what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
3949572 3950989 Maybe they got it wrong.
3951241 3954451 Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat<br />tasted like, actually tasted like...
3954744 3956745 ...oatmeal or tuna fish.
3957122 3959957 That makes you wonder.<br />Take chicken, for example.
3960208 3962209 Maybe they didn't know<br />what to make it taste like...
3962460 3964503 ...which is why it tastes<br />like everything.
3964754 3966547 - And maybe they...<br />- Shut up.
3968174 3969633 DOZER:<br />It's a single-celled protein...
3969884 3972928 ...combined with synthetic aminos,<br />vitamins and minerals.
3973179 3974429 Everything the body needs.
3974681 3977558 It doesn't have everything<br />the body needs.
3980311 3983397 I understand you've run through<br />the agent training program.
3984440 3986483 You know, I wrote that program.
3986776 3988068 Here it comes.
3988319 3990279 MOUSE: What did you think of her?<br />NEO: Of who?
3990655 3993699 The woman in the red dress.<br />I designed her.
3994033 3996785 She doesn't talk very much...
3997036 4000998 ...but if you'd like to meet her,<br />I can arrange a more personal milieu.
4001249 4002624 The digital pimp hard at work.
4002876 4005127 Pay no attention to<br />these hypocrites, Neo.
4006421 4008255 To deny our own impulses...
4008506 4011633 ...is to deny the very thing<br />that makes us human.
4013553 4014928 Dozer, when you're done...
4015138 4016722 ...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
4017307 4018640 We're going in.
4019350 4020767 I'm taking Neo to see her.
4024689 4025939 See who?
4026941 4028192 The Oracle.
4033698 4035240 Everyone please observe...
4035575 4038285 ...the "fasten seat belt"<br />and "no smoking" signs are on.
4038786 4042164 Sit back and enjoy your flight.
4042415 4044208 (PHONE RINGS)
4066606 4067606 We're in.
4083248 4084414 We'll be back in an hour.
4087919 4090462 (PHONE DIALS, THEN RINGS)
4099180 4101181 MORPHEUS:<br />Unbelievable...
4101432 4102766 ...isn't it?
4106354 4108188 - NEO: God!<br />- What?
4108856 4110232 I used to eat there.
4112485 4114111 Really good noodles.
4118908 4121410 I have these memories from my life.
4123871 4125539 None of them happened.
4126249 4127499 What does that mean?
4127750 4129960 That the Matrix cannot tell you<br />who you are.
4130878 4132087 But an oracle can?
4132547 4133755 That's different.
4138469 4139720 Did you go to her?
4141264 4142431 TRINITY:<br />Yes.
4142932 4144308 What did she tell you?
4147562 4149062 She told me...
4150106 4151273 What?
4155069 4156403 MORPHEUS:<br />We're here.
4156779 4159072 Neo, come with me.
4179052 4181470 So is this the same oracle<br />that made...
4181637 4182888 ...the prophecy?
4183139 4187476 Yes. She's very old. She's been<br />with us since the beginning.
4187935 4189936 - NEO: The beginning?<br />- Of the Resistance.
4192190 4194566 And she knows what? Everything?
4196611 4198528 She would say she knows enough.
4199655 4201448 And she's never wrong.
4203659 4206828 MORPHEUS: Try not to think of it<br />in terms of right and wrong.
4207163 4208747 She is a guide, Neo.
4209123 4210999 She can help you to find the path.
4211501 4212751 She helped you?
4213461 4214503 Yes.
4215254 4216588 What did she tell you?
4219050 4221259 That I would find the One.
4234399 4236525 I told you I can only<br />show you the door.
4237235 4239319 You have to walk through it.
4243116 4244199 Hello, Neo.
4244450 4246118 You're right on time.
4254043 4257838 Make yourself at home, Morpheus.<br />Neo, come with me.
4263511 4265095 These are the other Potentials.
4265346 4266888 You can wait here.
4307722 4310265 BOY:<br />Do not try and bend the spoon.
4310641 4312767 That's impossible.
4313603 4317606 Instead, only try<br />to realize the truth.
4318149 4319524 What truth?
4319775 4321443 There is no spoon.
4324030 4325363 There is no spoon?
4325615 4330076 Then you'll see that it is not the spoon<br />that bends. It is only yourself.
4346135 4347594 The Oracle will you see now.
4358314 4359856 ORACLE:<br />I know you're Neo.
4360483 4361650 Be right with you.
4362693 4365070 - You're the Oracle?<br />- Bingo.
4367782 4370659 Not quite what you<br />were expecting, right?
4371702 4373870 Almost done.
4376374 4377999 Smell good, don't they?
4379252 4380502 Yeah.
4380753 4382587 ORACLE:<br />I'd ask you to sit down...
4382838 4385215 ...but you're not going to anyway.
4385716 4388593 - And don't worry about the vase.<br />- What vase?
4391722 4392889 That vase.
4393849 4394891 I'm sorry.
4395142 4397018 I said, don't worry about it.
4398187 4400146 I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
4400773 4401982 How did you know?
4404026 4407821 What's really going to bake<br />your noodle later on is...
4408155 4411116 ...would you still have broken it<br />if I hadn't said anything?
4415913 4417831 You're cuter than I thought.
4420876 4423128 I can see why she likes you.
4424005 4425088 Who?
4425339 4427173 Not too bright, though.
4430469 4433555 You know why Morpheus<br />brought you to see me.
4435683 4436850 So...
4437810 4439185 ...what do you think?
4441022 4442772 Do you think you are the One?
4444734 4445775 I don't know.
4449196 4450614 You know what that means?
4451449 4452616 It's Latin.
4452992 4455201 Means, "Know thyself."
4456662 4458622 I'll let you in on a little secret.
4460875 4464711 Being the One is just<br />like being in love.
4465421 4468298 No one can tell you you're in love.<br />You just know it...
4468549 4469674 ...through and through.
4470009 4472052 Balls to bones.
4474388 4475430 Well...
4477391 4479476 ...I'd better have a look at you.
4480811 4482312 Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
4496702 4498370 Okay...
4498996 4503958 Now I'm supposed to say,<br />"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."
4504460 4505585 Then you say:
4506253 4507462 But what?
4507713 4511675 But you already know<br />what I'm going to tell you.
4513094 4516054 - I'm not the One.<br />- Sorry, kid.
4517682 4519683 You got the gift...
4520601 4522894 ...but it looks like<br />you're waiting for something.
4527566 4528608 What?
4528859 4531736 Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
4532321 4534572 That's the way these things go.
4535449 4538034 - What's funny?<br />- Morpheus.
4541497 4543206 He almost had me convinced.
4543457 4544582 I know.
4546127 4548253 Poor Morpheus.
4550631 4553758 Without him, we're lost.
4555302 4557470 What do you mean, "without him"?
4561475 4563393 Are you sure you want<br />to hear this?
4565604 4568356 Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
4570067 4572235 And no one, not you, not even me...
4572486 4574738 ...can convince him otherwise.
4575114 4577490 He believes it so blindly...
4577783 4582120 ...that he's going to sacrifice<br />his life to save yours.
4582329 4583496 What?
4583664 4586332 ORACLE: You're going to<br />have to make a choice.
4586959 4590545 In the one hand,<br />you'll have Morpheus' life.
4591046 4593923 And in the other hand,<br />you'll have your own.
4595342 4597635 One of you is going to die.
4599722 4603016 Which one will be up to you.
4604393 4606311 I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
4606562 4608229 You have a good soul.
4609315 4612025 And I hate giving<br />good people bad news.
4615154 4616613 Don't worry about it.
4616864 4619282 As soon as you<br />step outside that door...
4619533 4621659 ...you'll start feeling better.
4622369 4626164 You'll remember you don't believe<br />in any of this fate crap.
4626999 4629751 You're in control of your own life.
4630586 4631878 Remember?
4633547 4634756 Here...
4636634 4638176 ...take a cookie.
4638719 4642055 I promise, by the time<br />you're done eating it...
4643015 4645391 ...you'll feel right as rain.
4654610 4655944 What was said...

4658572 4660406 ...and for you alone.

4683347 4684430 They're on the way.
4714253 4715295 What is that?
4730060 4731477 Oh, déjà vu.
4734982 4736065 What did you just say?
4736317 4737817 Nothing.<br />Just déjà vu.
4738068 4739694 TRINITY: What did you see?<br />CYPHER: What happened?
4741113 4743281 A black cat went past us...
4743532 4745158 ...then another just like it.
4745409 4746951 Was it the same cat?
4747912 4750747 - I'm not sure.<br />- Switch, Apoc.
4754835 4756044 What is it?
4756295 4760715 A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the<br />Matrix when they change something.
4763677 4764928 Oh, my God.
4766722 4767722 Let's go.
4772978 4774771 They cut the hard line.<br />It's a trap! Get out!
4780235 4781486 Oh, no.
4821777 4824237 CYPHER: That's what they changed.<br />We're trapped.
4824488 4826364 MORPHEUS:<br />Be calm. Give me your phone.
4826615 4828157 TRINITY:<br />They'll be able to track it.
4828409 4829826 MORPHEUS:<br />We have no choice.
4831245 4832453 Operator.
4832788 4835623 <i>MORPHEUS: Find a structural drawing of<br />this building. Find it fast.</i>
4843465 4846050 <i>- Got it!<br />- MORPHEUS: I need the main wet-wall.</i>
4848887 4850138 Eighth floor.
4850347 4851931 <i>SMITH:<br />They're on the eighth floor.</i>
4852224 4853683 MORPHEUS:<br />Switch, straight ahead.
4854435 4855601 APOC:<br />Neo...
4861734 4863860 I hope the Oracle<br />gave you some good news.
4872161 4873661 <i>TANK:<br />Now left. That's it.</i>
4873954 4874996 MORPHEUS:<br />Good.
4884715 4886007 Where are they?
4929301 4930343 (COUGHS)
4944691 4946275 (SNEEZES)
4946443 4947610 They're in the walls.
4949071 4950238 COP:<br />In the walls!
4971635 4973302 It's an agent!
4980602 4981936 Morpheus!
4982104 4983354 MORPHEUS:<br />You must get Neo out!
4983605 4985439 He's all that matters!
4985732 4987942 - No, Morpheus! Don't!<br />- Trinity, go!
4988902 4990236 Go!
4996493 4998411 - We can't leave him!<br />- We have to!
5022728 5024520 Cypher, come on!
5029443 5033279 The great Morpheus.<br />We meet at last.
5033822 5034947 And you are?
5035199 5036949 A Smith.
5037201 5038492 Agent Smith.
5039077 5041120 You all look the same to me.
5096760 5098052 Take him.
5104685 5106143 No!
5111275 5113109 <i>- Operator.<br />- CYPHER: I need an exit, fast.</i>
5115195 5118114 There was an accident.<br />Goddamn car accident.
5118448 5120241 <i>CYPHER:<br />All of a sudden, boom.</i>
5120492 5121867 Somebody up there still likes me.
5122119 5123369 TANK:<br />I got you.
5123870 5125788 <i>CYPHER:<br />Just get me out of here fast.</i>
5126039 5128708 Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.<br />An old TV repair shop.
5128959 5130001 Right.
5133130 5134714 <i>- Operator.<br />- TRINITY: Tank, it's me.</i>
5134965 5136132 Is Morpheus alive?
5136508 5137800 Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
5138218 5140136 <i>Yes. They're moving him.<br />I don't know where.</i>
5140345 5142638 He's alive. We need an exit.
5142889 5143973 You're not far from Cypher.
5144141 5145391 <i>- TRINITY: Cypher?<br />- I know.</i>
5145642 5147727 <i>- I sent him to Franklin and Erie.<br />- Got it.</i>
5155527 5156569 (PHONE RINGS)
5156820 5158029 TANK:<br />Got him.
5168957 5169999 Where are they?
5170250 5171500 Making the call.
5172169 5173336 Good.
5174296 5176005 (PHONE RINGS)
5186475 5187725 You first.
5190937 5192146 Shit!
5195442 5197109 Tank!
5197277 5198903 No!
5200822 5202990 I don't know. It just went dead.
5208789 5211415 (PHONE RINGING)
5229810 5231018 <i>CYPHER:<br />Hello, Trinity.</i>
5231436 5232770 Cypher? Where's Tank?
5238360 5239402 You know...
5241113 5243239 ...for a long time...
5244449 5247326 ...I thought I was in love with you.
5248120 5250162 <i>I used to dream about you.</i>
5251248 5253958 You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
5254209 5256585 <i>Too bad things had to<br />turn out this way.</i>
5257129 5258170 You killed them.
5258672 5260172 - What?<br />- Oh, God.
5260424 5261841 I'm tired, Trinity.
5263260 5265136 I'm tired of this war...
5265429 5268264 ...tired of fighting.<br />I'm tired of this ship...
5268598 5273227 ...of being cold, of eating<br />the same goddamn goop every day.
5275439 5276564 But most of all...
5277149 5280526 <i>...I'm tired of that jackoff<br />and all of his bullshit.</i>
5281653 5282945 Surprise, asshole!
5283488 5285698 I bet you never saw this coming...
5285949 5286991 ...did you?
5289286 5291662 God, I wish I could be there...
5292247 5293747 ...when they break you.
5294791 5297960 I wish I could walk in<br />just when it happens...
5298670 5300379 ...so right then...
5300630 5301964 ...you'd know it was me.
5302466 5303632 You gave them Morpheus.
5303884 5305342 <i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>
5305927 5307428 He tricked us!
5307971 5309972 If you had told us the truth...
5310223 5313100 ...we would've told you to shove<br />that red pill up your ass!
5313351 5315478 That is not true, Cypher.<br />He set us free.
5315729 5318606 "Free." You call this free?
5321026 5323527 All I do is what he tells me to do.
5325113 5328032 If I had to choose between<br />that and the Matrix...
5329201 5330409 ...I choose the Matrix.
5330660 5332328 The Matrix isn't real.
5332579 5333996 <i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>
5334247 5336499 I think the Matrix...
5336833 5339418 ...can be more real than this world.
5341588 5344089 All I do is pull the plug here.
5344466 5345674 But there...
5346218 5348511 <i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
5349513 5350763 Trinity.
5356269 5359230 <i>- Welcome to the real world.<br />- But you're out, Cypher.</i>
5359481 5361899 <i>- You can't go back.<br />- That's what you think.</i>
5362150 5363651 <i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>
5363902 5367530 <i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,<br />I won't remember a thing.</i>
5367739 5368781 By the way...
5369032 5371992 ...if you have anything important<br />to say to Switch...
5372494 5373577 <i>...say it now.</i>
5373828 5376872 - No, please don't.<br />- Not like this.
5378583 5380209 Not like this.
5384673 5385714 Too late.
5386466 5387758 Goddamn you, Cypher!
5388009 5389885 Don't hate me, Trinity.
5390262 5392137 I'm just a messenger.
5392556 5395724 And right now,<br />I'm going to prove it to you.
5396810 5398477 If Morpheus was right...
5399020 5400896 ...there's no way<br />I can pull this plug.
5401481 5402982 <i>If Neo's the One...</i>
5403483 5405317 <i>...then there'd have to be...</i>
5405569 5408153 ...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
5408321 5409530 Right?
5410156 5412241 I mean, how can he be the One...
5412409 5413492 ...if he's dead?
5414869 5417121 <i>You never did answer me before...</i>
5417414 5419748 <i>...if you bought into<br />Morpheus' bullshit.</i>
5420125 5423335 Come on. All I want<br />is a little yes or no.
5424713 5427047 Look into his eyes...
5427799 5429300 <i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>
5432053 5433387 ...and tell me...
5434097 5435347 <i>...yes...</i>
5435682 5437057 <i>...or no.</i>
5438351 5439893 <i>- Yes.<br />- No!</i>
5440061 5441228 I don't believe it.
5442647 5447401 Believe it or not, you piece of shit,<br />you're still going to burn!
5454576 5455826 (PHONE RINGS)
5465670 5467046 You first.
5475263 5477556 - You're hurt.<br />- I'll be all right.
5480352 5481518 Dozer?
5499788 5502164 SMITH:<br />Have you ever stood and stared at it?
5503041 5506168 Marveled at its beauty...
5506544 5508796 ...its genius?
5509964 5511840 Billions of people...
5512092 5514843 ...just living out their lives.
5515887 5517554 Oblivious.
5522143 5525020 Did you know that the first Matrix...
5525271 5529942 ...was designed to be a perfect<br />human world where none suffered...
5530443 5533362 ...where everyone would be happy.
5533905 5535406 It was a disaster.
5535657 5539993 No one would accept the program.<br />Entire crops were lost.
5540870 5542621 Some believe that...
5542872 5547251 ...we lacked the programming language<br />to describe your perfect world.
5547502 5549044 But I believe that...
5549212 5550379 ...as a species...
5550630 5554466 ...human beings define<br />their reality through misery...
5554718 5556093 ...and suffering.
5556344 5559054 So the perfect world was a dream...
5559305 5564143 ...that your primitive cerebrum<br />kept trying to wake up from.
5565478 5569148 Which is why the Matrix was<br />redesigned to this.
5569607 5571108 The peak...
5571359 5572776 ...of your civilization.
5573027 5575279 I say, "your civilization"...
5575530 5579658 ...because when we started thinking<br />for you, it became our civilization...
5579909 5582995 ...which is, of course,<br />what this is all about.
5584330 5586915 Evolution, Morpheus.
5587208 5588542 Evolution.
5590837 5592713 Like the dinosaur.
5594883 5596508 Look out that window.
5597218 5599344 You had your time.
5600054 5603974 The future is our world, Morpheus.
5604309 5606685 The future is our time.
5610940 5612107 There could be a problem.
5613026 5616403 - NEO: What are they doing to him?<br />- They're breaking into his mind.
5616654 5618822 It's like hacking a computer.<br />All it takes is time.
5619073 5620282 How much time?
5620533 5623660 Depends on the mind.<br />But eventually, it'll crack...
5623912 5628331 ...and his alpha patterns<br />will change from this to this.
5628582 5631542 When it does, he'll tell them<br />anything they want to know.
5631794 5632835 What do they want?
5633086 5637131 The leader of every ship is given<br />codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
5637382 5640301 If an agent got the codes<br />and got into Zion's mainframe...
5640552 5643638 ...they could destroy us.<br />We can't let that happen.
5643806 5646057 Trinity, Zion's more important than me...
5646225 5647391 ...or you...
5647559 5648851 ...or even Morpheus.
5652648 5654315 There has to be<br />something we can do.
5654733 5656734 There is. We pull the plug.
5659822 5661572 You're going to kill him?
5661824 5662990 Kill Morpheus?
5663617 5665243 We don't have a choice.
5672042 5674961 Never send a human<br />to do a machine's job.
5675212 5676963 If the insider has failed...
5677214 5680424 ...they'll sever the connection<br />as soon as possible, unless...
5680676 5682385 They're dead. In either case...
5682636 5686180 We have no choice. Continue as planned.<br />Deploy the sentinels.
5686431 5687515 Immediately.
5692771 5695439 Morpheus, you were more<br />than a leader to us.
5696400 5698609 You were a father.
5700153 5702113 We'll miss you always.
5708996 5710204 Stop!
5711373 5712707 I don't believe this is happening.
5712875 5714917 - Neo, this has to be done.<br />- NEO: Does it?
5715711 5717086 I don't know.
5717421 5719881 - This can't be just coincidence.<br />- What?
5720090 5721340 NEO:<br />The Oracle.
5721592 5723384 She told me this would happen.
5723802 5727972 She told me that I would<br />have to make a choice.
5728432 5729640 What choice?
5732644 5735146 - What are you doing?<br />- I'm going in.
5735480 5737815 - TRINITY: No, you're not.<br />- I have to.
5738025 5741652 Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself<br />so that we could get you out.
5741904 5743821 There is no way<br />that you're going back in.
5744406 5747658 Morpheus did what he did because<br />he believed I'm something I'm not.
5749161 5750202 What?
5750913 5752538 I'm not the One, Trinity.
5752915 5755875 - The Oracle hit me with that too.<br />- No, you have to be.
5756126 5758794 I'm sorry, I'm not.<br />I'm just another guy.
5759463 5760713 No, Neo, that's not true.
5761298 5763925 - It can't be true.<br />- Why?
5768347 5771682 This is loco. They've got Morpheus<br />in a military-controlled building.
5771934 5776312 Even if you somehow got inside, those<br />are agents holding him. Three of them.
5777606 5781525 I want Morpheus back too, but<br />what you're talking about is suicide.
5781777 5783361 That's what it looks like...
5783528 5784570 ...but it's not.
5784821 5787198 I can't explain to you why it's not.
5788283 5791994 Morpheus believed something, and<br />he was ready to give his life for it.
5792245 5795247 I understand that now.<br />That's why I have to go.
5795540 5798042 - Why?<br />- Because I believe in something.
5798210 5799835 What?
5800545 5802254 I believe I can bring him back.
5819231 5821148 - What are you doing?<br />- Going with you.
5821441 5823442 - No, you're not.<br />- "No"?
5824611 5826737 Let me tell you what I believe.
5827239 5829615 Morpheus means more to me<br />than he does to you.
5829950 5834245 I believe if you are serious about<br />saving him, you will need my help.
5834496 5836539 And since I am the ranking officer...
5836790 5839667 ...if you don't like it,<br />I believe you can go to hell.
5840419 5842837 Because you aren't going anywhere else.
5843255 5844797 Tank...
5844965 5846090 ...load us up.
5855726 5859020 I'd like to share<br />a revelation that I've had...
5859438 5860980 ...during my time here.
5861231 5865234 It came to me when I tried<br />to classify your species...
5865485 5867737 ...and I realized...
5867988 5870281 ...that you're not actually mammals.
5872492 5874952 Every mammal on this planet...
5875287 5880207 ...instinctively develops an equilibrium<br />with the surrounding environment.
5880459 5882293 But you humans do not.
5882836 5886380 You move to an area<br />and you multiply...
5886631 5891135 ...and multiply until every<br />natural resource is consumed.
5891470 5893554 The only way you can survive...
5893847 5896807 ...is to spread to another area.
5902230 5905107 There is another organism<br />on this planet...
5905358 5907318 ...that follows the same pattern.
5907944 5909612 Do you know what it is?
5909988 5911822 A virus.
5913158 5916202 Human beings are a disease.
5916578 5918120 A cancer of this planet.
5918371 5920498 You are a plague.
5921041 5922458 And we...
5922626 5924001 ...are the cure.
5925003 5926420 Okay, so what do you need?
5927047 5928172 Besides a miracle.
5928757 5929965 Guns.
5930801 5932009 Lots of guns.
5941895 5943104 Neo...
5944856 5947399 No one has ever done<br />anything like this.
5948610 5950528 That's why it's going to work.
5954616 5956534 Why isn't the serum working?
5957160 5959453 Perhaps we're asking<br />the wrong questions.
5961540 5962790 Leave me with him.
5965377 5966502 Now.
5977722 5979306 TANK:<br />Hold on, Morpheus.
5979558 5982268 They're coming for you.<br />They're coming.
5984646 5986772 SMITH:<br />Can you hear me, Morpheus?
5987023 5989692 I'm going to be honest...
5990068 5991277 ...with you.
5995657 5997074 I...
5997951 5999076 ...hate...
5999327 6001287 ...this place...
6001621 6003914 ...this zoo...
6004166 6005291 ...this prison...
6005542 6008711 ...this reality,<br />whatever you want to call it.
6008962 6011255 I can't stand it any longer.
6012007 6013883 It's the smell.
6015260 6017136 If there is such a thing.
6017470 6020764 I feel saturated by it.
6022267 6023559 I can...
6023810 6025352 ...taste...
6025520 6027563 ...your stink.
6027814 6031442 And every time I do, I fear that<br />I have somehow been infected by it.
6031610 6032610 It's repulsive.
6033612 6034987 Isn't it?
6037157 6039450 I must get out of here.
6039868 6042077 I must get free.
6042329 6045206 And in this mind is the key.
6045457 6047124 My key.
6047375 6050252 Once Zion is destroyed,<br />there is no need for me to be here.
6050503 6052129 Do you understand?
6052422 6053797 I need the codes.
6054049 6056383 I have to get inside Zion...
6056718 6059220 ...and you have to tell me how.
6059638 6061513 You're going to tell me...
6061765 6063933 ...or you're going to die.
6084120 6087248 Please remove any metallic items<br />you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
6091169 6092211 Holy shit!
6104307 6107017 Backup. Send backup.
6130834 6131959 Freeze!
6266803 6268011 What were you doing?
6269848 6271140 He doesn't know.
6271391 6272891 Know what?
6300962 6303464 I think they're trying to save him.
6318313 6320063 There is no spoon.
6349677 6351845 Find them and destroy them!
6353473 6355307 We're under attack!
6387423 6388590 Trinity!
6389092 6390175 Help!
6412198 6413407 Only human.
6414367 6415450 Dodge this.
6428673 6430173 - How did you do that?<br />- Do what?
6430592 6434511 You moved like they do.<br />I've never seen anyone move that fast.
6435638 6437014 It wasn't fast enough.
6439767 6441059 Can you fly that thing?
6442186 6443186 Not yet.
6446482 6447524 Operator.
6447734 6450902 <i>TRINITY: I need a pilot program<br />for a B-212 helicopter.</i>
6451362 6452654 <i>Hurry.</i>
6460580 6462205 Let's go.
6477305 6478388 No.
6529982 6532609 Morpheus, get up.<br />Get up, get up.
6570648 6571690 He's not going to make it.
6581492 6582534 Got you.
6648601 6649768 Trinity!
6691435 6692853 I knew it.
6693479 6694688 He's the One.
6710663 6712873 Do you believe it now, Trinity?
6715751 6716918 Morpheus...
6718588 6719671 The Oracle.
6720923 6723300 - She told me...<br />- She told you...
6723676 6725260 ...what you needed to hear.
6725553 6726887 That's all.
6727930 6730891 Sooner or later you'll realize,<br />just as I did...
6731225 6733518 ...there's a difference<br />between knowing the path...
6734270 6735562 ...and walking the path.
6738608 6739816 <i>- Operator.<br />- MORPHEUS: Tank.</i>
6740735 6743278 <i>- It's good to hear your voice.<br />- We need an exit.</i>
6743529 6746323 Got one ready. Subway station,<br />State and Balboa.
6759378 6761796 - Damn it!<br />- The trace was completed.
6762048 6765634 - We have their position.<br />- Sentinels are standing by.
6767345 6768845 Order the strike.
6775394 6777395 They're not out yet.
6778606 6779814 (PHONE RINGS)
6788574 6789908 You first, Morpheus.
6810596 6812889 Neo, I want to tell you something...
6816143 6820105 ...but I'm afraid of<br />what it could mean if I do.
6820314 6821398 (PHONE RINGS)
6823693 6826987 Everything the Oracle<br />told me has come true.
6829740 6831282 Everything but this.
6832785 6833827 But what?
6858728 6859894 Neo!
6860146 6861771 - What happened?<br />- TRINITY: An agent.
6862023 6863940 - Send me back.<br />- I can't.
6865985 6867944 Mr. Anderson.
6870156 6871531 Run, Neo. Run.
6876829 6878455 What is he doing?
6878706 6879956 He's beginning to believe.
6906942 6908318 You're empty.
6908903 6910195 So are you.
6943354 6946356 I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
6947483 6948525 ...Mr. Anderson.
6989483 6991568 Jesus, he's killing him.
7077738 7079864 You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
7080616 7083618 That is the sound of inevitability.
7086205 7089540 It is the sound of your death.
7090459 7092794 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7093045 7094671 My name...
7097675 7099717 ...is Neo.

7152313 7154564 - How long?<br />- Five, maybe six minutes.
7156608 7158776 Tank, charge the EMP.
7159028 7162071 - We can't use that until he's out.<br />- MORPHEUS: I know. Don't worry.
7163240 7164324 He's gonna make it.
7164575 7166451 Flat or pumps? No, just...
7166702 7169579 What the shit? That's my phone!
7169997 7171581 That guy took my phone!
7173959 7176252 Got him!<br />He's on the run.

7413448 7414824 Check him.
7418829 7420371 He's gone.
7427087 7429505 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7437097 7438139 Neo...
7439600 7441559 I'm not afraid anymore.
7443186 7444520 The Oracle told me...
7444688 7450109 ...I'd fall in love, and that<br />the man I loved would be the One.
7453238 7455197 So you see...
7455907 7457908 ...you can't be dead.
7459494 7461329 You can't be...
7462873 7465041 ...because I love you.
