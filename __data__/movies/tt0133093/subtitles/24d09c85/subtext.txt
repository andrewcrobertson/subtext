149690 154111 You give me that "juris-my-dick-tion"<br />crap, you can cram it up your ass.
154570 157072 The orders were for your protection.
157239 158323 [LIEUTENANT LAUGHS]
158574 160784 I think we can handle one little girl.
165915 167666 I sent two units!
167917 169501 They're bringing her down now!
169752 172880 No, lieutenant, your men<br />are already dead.
201951 203035 TRINITY:<br />Shit.
205955 208040 Morpheus, the line was traced.<br />I don't know how.
208290 209916 MORPHEUS:<br /><i>I know. They cut the hard line.</i>
210126 212294 <i>There's no time.<br />Get to another exit.</i>
212545 214964 -Are there any agents?<br />MORPHEUS: <i>Yes.</i>

381338 383006 JONES:<br />The name is Neo.

476100 477392 CHOI:<br />It's Choi.
482523 484358 Yeah. Yeah.
490906 492073 You're two hours late.
492658 494409 I know. It's her fault.
494576 495660 You got the money?
497788 498955 Two grand.
499832 500958 Hold on.
518642 520018 CHOI:<br />Hallelujah.
520269 523146 You're my savior.<br />My own personal Jesus Christ.
523397 525273 You get caught using that...
525524 527651 I know. This never happened.<br />You don't exist.
528777 530862 NEO: Right.<br />CHOI: Something wrong, man?
531113 533156 You look a little whiter than usual.
534283 536451 My computer, it...
539455 543955 Ever have that feeling where you're<br />not sure if you're awake or dreaming?
544793 547545 All the time.<br />It's called mescaline.
548047 550174 It's the only way to fly.

556722 560475 What do you think, Dujour?<br />Should we take him with us?
562478 563687 Definitely.

567649 568775 Come on.
569026 571653 It'll be fun. I promise.
578160 579661 Yeah.

582831 584290 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]
609942 611026 Hello, Neo.
612361 613528 How do you know that name?
614363 616073 I know a lot about you.
616949 619034 -Who are you?<br />-My name is Trinity.
619993 621202 Trinity.
622830 623997 The Trinity?
624456 626166 That cracked the IRS D-base?
626416 627875 That was a long time ago.
628127 630045 -Jesus.<br />-What?
630504 632297 I just thought...
634049 635216 ...you were a guy.
635467 636926 Most guys do.
638137 640347 That was you on my computer.
640973 642057 How did you do that?
642724 645435 Right now, all I can tell you...
646061 647604 ...is that you're in danger.
648063 650482 TRINITY: I brought you here to warn you.<br />-Of what?
651066 652734 They're watching you, Neo.
653318 655737 -Who is?<br />-Please just listen.
659241 661076 I know why you're here, Neo.
661869 663829 I know what you've been doing.
664079 665955 I know why you hardly sleep...
666248 669376 ...why you live alone and why,<br />night after night...
669626 671961 ...you sit at your computer.
673130 674673 You're looking for him.
675465 678468 I know, because I was once<br />looking for the same thing.
678969 681096 And when he found me...
681722 684808 ...he told me I wasn't really<br />looking for him...
685726 687477 ...I was looking for an answer.
688103 691231 It's the question that drives us, Neo.
691899 694568 It's the question<br />that brought you here.
696653 698029 You know the question...
698280 699781 ...just as I did.
701325 702951 What is the Matrix?
703202 705662 The answer is out there, Neo.
706330 708332 It's looking for you.
709124 710792 And it will find you...
711084 713086 ...if you want it to.

719801 720843 Shit.
721011 722220 Shit, shit.
732481 735317 You have a problem with authority,<br />Mr. Anderson.
735567 739612 You believe that you are special,<br />that the rules do not apply to you.
740322 742324 Obviously, you are mistaken.
745285 748162 This is one of the top<br />software companies in the world...
748413 751791 ...because employees understand<br />they are part of a whole.
752042 756542 Thus, if an employee has a problem,<br />the company has a problem.
758924 762135 The time has come to make<br />a choice, Mr. Anderson.
763011 766889 Either you choose to be at your desk<br />on time from this day forth...
767516 770101 ...or you choose to find another job.
770978 772312 Do I make myself clear?
772562 774981 Yes, Mr. Rhineheart.<br />Perfectly clear.
783115 784324 MESSENGER:<br />Thomas Anderson?

870535 873204 -Okay.<br /><i>-The cubicle across from you is empty.</i>
876333 878460 -But what if they--<br /><i>-Go. Now.</i>
885217 887594 <i>Stay here for just a moment.</i>
894810 897562 <i>When I tell you,<br />go to the end of the row...</i>
897813 899773 <i>...to the office<br />at the end of the hall.</i>
900023 902400 <i>Stay as low as you can.</i>
904694 905820 <i>Go. Now.</i>
920210 923755 <i>Good. Now, outside<br />there is a scaffold.</i>
926466 928801 -How do you know this?<br /><i>-We don't have time.</i>
929052 931888 <i>To your left there's a window.<br />Go to it.</i>
934141 935684 <i>Open it.</i>
936518 938311 <i>Take the scaffold to the roof.</i>
938562 941147 No way! No way!<br />This is crazy!
941398 943775 <i>There are two ways<br />out of this building.</i>
944025 947820 <i>One is that scaffold.<br />The other is in their custody.</i>
948071 951282 <i>You take a chance either way.<br />I leave it to you.</i>
954870 956621 This is insane!
957789 959665 Why is this happening to me?
959958 961584 What'd I do?
961960 964712 I'm nobody.<br />I didn't do anything.
965297 966756 I'm gonna die.
976558 977600 Shit!
997871 998997 Oh, shit!
1003960 1005753 I can't do this.
1018391 1019433 Shit.
1068692 1073192 As you can see, we've had our eye on<br />you for some time now, Mr. Anderson.
1074823 1077492 It seems that you've been living...
1077742 1079869 ...two lives.
1081288 1083790 In one life,<br />you're Thomas A. Anderson...
1084040 1087376 ...program writer for<br />a respectable software company.
1088420 1091714 You have a social security number.<br />You pay your taxes.
1092173 1093424 And you...
1095010 1098638 ...help your landlady<br />carry out her garbage.
1101141 1104269 The other life is lived in computers...
1104561 1107522 ...where you go by<br />the hacker alias "Neo"...
1107772 1112272 ...and are guilty of virtually every<br />computer crime we have a law for.
1113862 1115822 One of these lives...
1116072 1117907 ...has a future.
1118241 1120243 And one of them does not.
1123955 1127792 I'm going to be as forthcoming<br />as I can be, Mr. Anderson.
1128793 1130127 You're here...
1130462 1132714 ...because we need your help.
1136343 1139346 We know that you've been contacted<br />by a certain...
1139596 1141389 ...individual.
1142307 1146352 A man who calls himself "Morpheus."
1147354 1151358 Whatever you think you know<br />about this man is irrelevant.
1151608 1154027 He is considered by many authorities...
1154277 1157321 ...to be the most dangerous man alive.
1160033 1161242 My colleagues...
1161701 1164620 ...believe that I am wasting<br />my time with you.
1164913 1168333 But I believe you wish<br />to do the right thing.
1168625 1172128 We're willing to wipe the slate clean...
1172504 1174631 ...give you a fresh start.
1175131 1178050 All we're asking in return<br />is your cooperation...
1178301 1181804 ...in bringing<br />a known terrorist to justice.
1183181 1184432 Yeah.
1185725 1187810 That sounds like a really good deal.
1189437 1191188 But I got a better one.
1191439 1192940 How about...
1193358 1195360 ...I give you the finger...
1197946 1199948 ...and you give me my phone call.
1202158 1203993 Mr. Anderson...
1208164 1209206 ...you disappoint me.
1209457 1212084 You can't scare me<br />with this gestapo crap.
1212335 1213711 I know my rights.
1213962 1215463 I want my phone call.
1216047 1218215 Tell me, Mr. Anderson...
1219092 1220510 ...what good is a phone call...
1220760 1224346 ...if you're unable to speak?
1258131 1260341 You're going to help us,<br />Mr. Anderson...
1260842 1263010 ...whether you want to or not.

1324948 1329243 <i>They got to you first, but they've<br />underestimated how important you are.</i>
1329494 1331329 <i>If they knew what I know...</i>
1331579 1333581 <i>...you would probably be dead.</i>
1334582 1338294 What are you talking about?<br />What is happening to me?
1338545 1343045 <i>You are the One, Neo. You may have<br />spent the last few years...</i>
1343633 1346594 <i>...looking for me, but I've spent<br />my entire life...</i>
1346845 1348346 <i>...looking for you.</i>
1349889 1352057 <i>Now, do you still want to meet?</i>
1353017 1355894 -Yes.<br /><i>-Then go to the Adams Street bridge.</i>
1366114 1367323 Get in.
1379377 1380419 What's this?
1380670 1383214 It's necessary, Neo.<br />For our protection.
1383464 1385632 -From what?<br />-From you.
1387176 1388635 -Take off your shirt.<br />-What?
1388803 1389970 Stop the car.
1394559 1395726 Listen, coppertop.
1395977 1397979 We don't have time for 20 Questions.
1398479 1400856 Right now, there's only one rule:
1401149 1402483 Our way...
1402817 1403901 ...or the highway.
1410450 1411534 Fine.
1413411 1415871 Please, Neo, you have to trust me.
1416456 1419083 -Why?<br />-Because you have been down there.
1419834 1421043 You know that road.
1422045 1423671 You know exactly where it ends.
1425882 1428134 And I know that's<br />not where you want to be.
1442315 1443858 Apoc, lights.
1446361 1448529 TRINITY: Lie back.<br />Lift up your shirt.
1450448 1452700 -What's that?<br />-You're bugged.
1460458 1461917 Try and relax.
1468216 1469383 Come on.
1470426 1471468 Come on.
1473221 1474222 It's on the move.
1476015 1477224 Come on, you shit.
1479060 1481312 -You're gonna lose it.<br />-No, I'm not.
1481479 1482563 Clear!
1491155 1493282 Jesus Christ!<br />That thing's real!?
1527025 1528359 This is it.
1531696 1534156 Let me give you one piece of advice.
1535116 1536784 Be honest.
1538369 1540579 He knows more than you can imagine.
1549297 1550631 At last.
1552175 1553259 Welcome, Neo.
1554469 1556387 As you no doubt have guessed...
1556637 1557888 ...I am Morpheus.
1558931 1560515 It's an honor to meet you.
1560975 1562017 No...
1562602 1563894 ...the honor is mine.
1564812 1567314 Please, come. Sit.
1582413 1584039 I imagine...
1584457 1587209 ...that right now you're feeling<br />a bit like Alice...
1588920 1591339 ...tumbling down the rabbit hole?
1592173 1593257 You could say that.
1594175 1596802 I can see it in your eyes.
1597386 1600680 You have the look of a man<br />who accepts what he sees...
1600932 1603184 ...because he's expecting to wake up.
1604602 1607187 Ironically, this is not<br />far from the truth.
1607897 1610274 Do you believe in fate, Neo?
1610441 1611525 No.
1611943 1612985 Why not?
1613236 1616030 I don't like the idea that<br />I'm not in control of my life.
1617115 1620451 I know exactly what you mean.
1624747 1627124 Let me tell you why you're here.
1628167 1629710 You know something.
1630253 1631879 What you know,<br />you can't explain.
1632380 1633964 But you feel it.
1634549 1636467 You felt it your entire life:
1637051 1641221 Something's wrong with the world.<br />You don't know what, but it's there.
1641722 1643932 Like a splinter in your mind...
1644183 1646059 ...driving you mad.
1646978 1649730 It is this feeling<br />that has brought you to me.
1652275 1654110 Do you know what<br />I'm talking about?
1655945 1657279 The Matrix?
1659782 1661450 Do you want to know...
1661909 1663911 ...what it is?
1666289 1668165 The Matrix is everywhere.
1668416 1670126 It is all around us.
1670376 1672336 Even now, in this very room.
1673171 1675381 You can see it when you<br />look out your window...
1675631 1677966 ...or when you turn on your television.
1678384 1680928 You can feel it when you go to work...
1682471 1684139 ...when you go to church...
1684557 1686642 ...when you pay your taxes.
1687768 1690687 It is the world that has been<br />pulled over your eyes...
1690938 1692522 ...to blind you from the truth.
1694734 1695985 What truth?
1700239 1701782 That you are a slave.
1703284 1705577 Like everyone else,<br />you were born into bondage...
1705828 1710328 ...born into a prison that you cannot<br />smell or taste or touch.
1710791 1712083 A prison...
1712335 1713461 ...for your mind.
1720468 1722803 Unfortunately, no one can be...
1723137 1725514 ...told what the Matrix is.
1728976 1730852 You have to see it for yourself.
1740363 1742656 This is your last chance.
1742907 1745242 After this, there is no turning back.
1745701 1747160 You take the blue pill...
1747495 1750539 ...the story ends, you wake up<br />in your bed and believe...
1750790 1752583 ...whatever you want to believe.
1752833 1754167 You take the red pill...
1754418 1756378 ...you stay in Wonderland...
1756879 1759590 ...and I show you how deep<br />the rabbit hole goes.
1769475 1770684 Remember...
1771519 1774563 ...all I'm offering is the truth.<br />Nothing more.
1788869 1790203 Follow me.
1792748 1794416 Apoc, are we on-line?
1794667 1796043 APOC:<br />Almost.
1799380 1801423 MORPHEUS:<br />Time is always against us.
1801799 1803300 Please take a seat there.
1821485 1823195 -You did all this?<br />TRINITY: Mm-hm.
1827325 1829327 The pill you took is<br />part of a trace program.
1830077 1834577 It disrupts your carrier signals<br />so we can pinpoint your location.
1835249 1836291 What does that mean?
1836876 1839044 It means buckle your<br />seat belt, Dorothy...
1839378 1840712 ...because Kansas...
1840963 1842005 ...is going bye-bye.
1879919 1881295 Did you...?
1892306 1896393 Have you ever had a dream, Neo,<br />that you were so sure was real?
1897853 1900438 What if you were unable<br />to wake from that dream?
1900689 1903191 How would you know the difference<br />between the dream world...
1903818 1905236 ...and the real world?
1906862 1908029 NEO:<br />This can't be.
1908197 1909239 MORPHEUS:<br />Be what?
1909949 1911450 Be real?
1915413 1916831 -Going into replication.<br />-Apoc?
1917039 1918040 Still nothing.
1918624 1919833 NEO:<br />It's cold.
1920084 1921460 It's cold!
1925339 1927007 Tank, we'll need a signal soon.
1928509 1931178 -I got a fibrillation.<br />-Apoc, location.
1931429 1932888 APOC:<br />Targeting almost there.
1936183 1937601 He's going into arrest.
1937852 1940354 -Lock. I got him!<br />-Now, Tank, now!
2117615 2118699 Welcome...
2119033 2120951 ...to the real world.
2122369 2124204 MORPHEUS:<br />We've done it, Trinity.
2124455 2125998 We found him.
2126248 2129042 -I hope you're right.<br />MORPHEUS: I don't have to hope.
2129627 2131211 I know it.
2136383 2137425 Am I dead?
2137926 2140094 Far from it.
2154068 2155486 He still needs a lot of work.
2157029 2158113 What are you doing?
2158364 2160574 Your muscles atrophied.<br />We're rebuilding them.
2161158 2162701 Why do my eyes hurt?
2163410 2165286 You've never used them before.
2169041 2170083 Rest, Neo.
2170334 2172002 The answers are coming.
2242656 2244240 [DOOR OPENS]
2246577 2248161 Morpheus, what's happened to me?
2248787 2249871 What is this place?
2250122 2252791 More important than "what" is "when."
2253292 2254334 "When'?
2254543 2256586 You believe it's the year 1999...
2256837 2259089 ...when in fact, it's closer to 2199.
2260215 2262967 I can't tell you exactly<br />what year it is...
2263218 2264844 ...because we honestly don't know.
2265345 2268181 There's nothing I can say<br />that will explain it for you.
2268432 2271184 Come with me.<br />See for yourself.
2271727 2273478 MORPHEUS:<br />This is my ship.
2273771 2276690 The <i>Nebuchadnezzar.</i><br />It's a hovercraft.
2279526 2281277 This is the main deck.
2287034 2288285 This is the core...
2290788 2294541 ...where we broadcast our pirate signal<br />and hack into the Matrix.
2297920 2301089 Most of my crew you already know.
2306094 2307512 This is Apoc...
2308305 2309639 ...Switch...
2311225 2312392 -...and Cypher.<br />-Hi.
2312643 2316355 The ones you don't know:<br />Tank and his big brother, Dozer.
2317231 2319650 The little one behind you is Mouse.
2323987 2327240 You wanted to know<br />what the Matrix is?
2328283 2329492 Trinity.
2350514 2352098 Try to relax.
2356979 2358814 This will feel a little weird.
2370784 2372160 This...
2372327 2374037 ...is the Construct.
2374454 2376581 It's our loading program.
2376832 2379292 We can load anything, from clothing...
2379543 2380919 ...to equipment...
2381211 2382545 ...weapons...
2383171 2385006 ...training simulations...
2385382 2387926 ...anything we need.
2390721 2393140 NEO: Right now we're inside<br />a computer program?
2393432 2395350 Is it really so hard to believe?
2395851 2398478 Your clothes are different.<br />The plugs in your body are gone.
2399688 2401773 Your hair has changed.
2402149 2405485 Your appearance now is what we call<br />"residual self-image."
2406194 2408821 It is the mental projection<br />of your digital self.
2414703 2415829 This isn't real?
2416079 2417622 What is "real"?
2417998 2420250 How do you define "real"?
2420542 2422460 If you're talking about<br />what you can feel...
2422711 2425130 ...what you can smell, taste and see...
2425380 2429258 ...then "real" is simply electrical<br />signals interpreted by your brain.
2433430 2435849 This is the world that you know.
2437267 2440311 The world as it was at the end<br />of the 20th century.
2442689 2447026 It exists now only as part of<br />a neural-interactive simulation...
2447277 2448528 ...that we call the Matrix.
2453075 2455869 You've been living<br />in a dream world, Neo.
2456870 2457996 This is the world...
2458288 2460039 ...as it exists today.
2473095 2476056 Welcome to "the desert...
2476932 2478516 ...of the real."
2481895 2484272 We have only bits and pieces<br />of information.
2484523 2488318 But what we know for certain<br />is that in the early 21st century...
2488568 2491821 ...all of mankind was united<br />in celebration.
2492072 2496572 We marveled at our own magnificence<br />as we gave birth to Al.
2497619 2498745 Al.
2499788 2501164 You mean artificial intelligence.
2501415 2505836 A singular consciousness that spawned<br />an entire race of machines.
2506670 2510131 We don't know who struck first,<br />us or them.
2510549 2513760 But we know that it was us<br />that scorched the sky.
2515429 2517597 They were dependent on solar power...
2517848 2521184 ...and it was believed that<br />they would be unable to survive...
2521518 2525021 ...without an energy source<br />as abundant as the sun.
2525272 2529772 Throughout human history, we have<br />been dependent on machines to survive.
2531611 2535823 Fate, it seems, is not<br />without a sense of irony.
2539036 2543457 The human body generates more<br />bioelectricity than a 120-volt battery.
2543707 2547836 And over 25,000 BTUs of body heat.
2549755 2551923 Combined with a form of fusion...
2552257 2556757 ...the machines had found all the energy<br />they would ever need.
2561141 2564894 There are fields, Neo,<br />endless fields...
2565145 2568398 ...where human beings<br />are no longer born.
2569107 2570942 We are grown.
2576990 2579575 For the longest time,<br />I wouldn't believe it.
2579826 2582495 And then I saw the fields<br />with my own eyes...
2583830 2585456 ...watched them liquefy the dead...
2585707 2589043 ...so they could be fed intravenously<br />to the living.
2589586 2593840 And standing there,<br />facing the pure, horrifying precision...
2594091 2597010 ...I came to realize<br />the obviousness of the truth.
2599638 2601431 What is the Matrix?
2602641 2603683 Control.
2605060 2608438 The Matrix is a computer-generated<br />dream world...
2609231 2612317 ...built to keep us under control...
2613485 2616654 ...in order to change a human being...
2617280 2618447 ...into this.
2619825 2620951 No.
2622577 2624161 I don't believe it.
2624538 2625747 It's not possible.
2626331 2630831 I didn't say it would be easy, Neo.<br />I just said it would be the truth.
2631169 2632461 Stop!
2633004 2634213 Let me out!
2634923 2636841 Let me out! I want out!
2638802 2641471 -Easy, Neo. Easy.<br />-Get this thing out of me.
2641721 2643389 Get this thing out of me!
2645183 2646684 Don't touch me!
2646935 2648561 Stay away from me!
2648979 2650480 I don't believe it.
2651189 2652398 I don't believe it.
2652649 2654150 I don't believe it.
2654401 2656444 -He's gonna pop.<br />-Breathe, Neo.
2656820 2657904 Just breathe.
2676298 2678091 I can't go back, can I?
2678925 2680343 No.
2681178 2682387 But if you could...
2683221 2684722 ...would you really want to?
2687225 2688601 I owe you an apology.
2689186 2690562 We have a rule.
2691021 2694274 We never free a mind<br />once it's reached a certain age.
2694441 2695525 It's dangerous.
2696234 2697944 The mind has trouble letting go.
2698195 2700488 I've seen it before, and I'm sorry.
2701531 2703616 I did what I did because...
2704326 2705785 ...I had to.
2714211 2718298 When the Matrix was first built,<br />there was a man born inside...
2718798 2722593 ...who had the ability<br />to change whatever he wanted...
2722969 2725888 ...to remake the Matrix as he saw fit.
2727641 2731102 It was he who freed the first of us...
2731978 2733604 ...taught us the truth.
2735065 2738151 As long as the Matrix exists...
2738485 2740570 ...the human race will never be free.
2744783 2746326 After he died...
2747077 2749788 ...the Oracle prophesied his return...
2750330 2753541 ...and that his coming would hail<br />the destruction of the Matrix...
2753792 2755460 ...end the war...
2755794 2757045 ...bring freedom to our people.
2758380 2762880 That is why there are those of us who<br />spent our lives searching the Matrix...
2763343 2764927 ...looking for him.
2767347 2769432 I did what I did because...
2771059 2773186 ...I believe that search is over.
2778275 2779693 Get some rest.
2780318 2782111 You're going to need it.
2784823 2785865 For what?
2788910 2790119 Your training.
2808430 2810140 Morning. Did you sleep?
2811016 2812225 You will tonight.
2812600 2814143 I guarantee it.
2815645 2817563 I'm Tank. I'll be your operator.
2818023 2820442 -You don't have any--<br />-Holes? Nope.
2821359 2825859 Me and my brother, Dozer, are 100%<br />pure, old-fashioned, homegrown human.
2826323 2827532 Born free right here...
2828074 2829408 ...in the real world.
2829659 2831327 Genuine child of Zion.
2832162 2834622 -Zion?<br />-If the war was over tomorrow...
2834873 2836374 ...Zion's where the party would be.
2836791 2838083 It's a city?
2838335 2841504 The last human city.<br />The only place we have left.
2843089 2844340 Where is it?
2846092 2849512 Deep underground near the Earth's core,<br />where it's still warm.
2851139 2853015 You live long enough,<br />you might see it.
2855268 2859768 Goddamn! I gotta tell you, I'm excited<br />to see what you're capable of...
2860357 2862108 ...if Morpheus is right and all.
2862609 2865361 We're not supposed to<br />talk about this, but...
2865612 2867030 ...if you are...
2868114 2870116 ...it's a very exciting time.
2871159 2873870 We got a lot to do.<br />We gotta get to it.
2877791 2880710 We're supposed to start<br />with these programs first.
2881711 2885172 That's major boring shit.<br />Let's do something more fun.
2885507 2886966 How about...
2888551 2890302 ...combat training?
2896351 2897810 "Jujitsu"?
2898686 2900354 I'm going to learn jujitsu?
2911699 2912908 Holy shit!
2913159 2915494 "Hey, Mikey, I think he likes it."
2915829 2917121 How about some more?
2917372 2918664 Hell, yes.
2920750 2921792 Hell, yeah.
2933972 2935056 How is he?
2935306 2937474 Ten hours straight.<br />He's a machine.
2948695 2950071 I know kung fu.
2951739 2952740 Show me.
2954534 2956285 This is a sparring program...
2956536 2959330 ...similar to the programmed reality<br />of the Matrix.
2959581 2961916 It has the same basic rules.<br />Like gravity.
2962167 2965628 These rules are no different<br />than those of a computer system.
2966171 2967672 Some of them can be bent.
2967881 2970341 Others can be broken.
2970884 2971968 Understand?
2973052 2974094 Then hit me...
2974679 2975805 ...if you can.
3014802 3015844 Good!
3016596 3017763 Adaptation.
3018056 3019265 Improvisation.
3019557 3020891 But your weakness...
3021142 3022518 ...is not your technique.
3029484 3031569 Morpheus is fighting Neo.
3103850 3105017 How did I beat you?
3111608 3112692 You're too fast.
3113234 3114568 Do you believe that...
3114944 3117446 ...my being stronger or faster...
3117697 3121367 ...has anything to do<br />with my muscles in this place?
3125413 3127206 You think you're breathing air?
3140720 3141929 Again!
3153399 3155818 Jesus Christ, he's fast!
3156069 3158279 His neuro-kinetics<br />are way above normal.
3163743 3165202 What are you waiting for?
3165453 3167413 You're faster than this.
3169624 3171834 Don't think you are.
3172085 3173753 Know you are.
3184138 3186932 Come on! Stop trying to hit me,<br />and hit me!
3196859 3198610 I don't believe it.
3200154 3202281 I know what you're trying to do.
3203950 3206118 I'm trying to free your mind, Neo.
3206452 3208537 But I can only show you the door.
3209122 3210957 You have to walk through it.
3213334 3215461 Tank, load the jump program.
3227056 3229767 You have to let it all go, Neo.<br />Fear...
3230309 3232477 ...doubt and disbelief.
3233646 3236357 Free your mind.
3244615 3245741 Whoa.
3252540 3254250 Okey-dokey.
3256335 3257502 Free my mind.
3257962 3259088 What if he makes it?
3259338 3262049 -No one's ever made their first jump.<br />MOUSE: I know.
3263384 3265844 -But what if he does?<br />-He won't.
3266429 3267513 Come on.
3267764 3268931 All right.
3269390 3271433 No problem. Free my mind.
3272226 3275020 Free my mind. No problem. Right.
3294415 3296083 What does that mean?
3296459 3298294 It doesn't mean anything.
3298878 3301463 Everybody falls the first time.
3301923 3303215 Right, Trin?
3323903 3326530 -I thought it wasn't real.<br />-Your mind makes it real.
3329784 3332036 If you're killed in the Matrix...
3332203 3333245 ...you die here?
3333871 3336331 The body cannot live without the mind.
3366821 3370199 I don't remember you ever<br />bringing me dinner.
3373286 3376122 There is something about him,<br />isn't there?
3376747 3378373 You're a believer now?
3379375 3380584 I keep wondering...
3380835 3384505 ...if Morpheus is so sure,<br />why not take him to see the Oracle?
3385423 3388342 Morpheus will take him<br />when he's ready.
3398144 3399687 The Matrix is a system, Neo.
3401439 3402731 That system is our enemy.
3403357 3405692 But when you're inside,<br />what do you see?
3405943 3409738 Businessmen, teachers,<br />lawyers, carpenters.
3410197 3412782 The very minds of the people<br />we are trying to save.
3413034 3415995 But until we do, these people are<br />a part of that system...
3416245 3418163 ...and that makes them our enemy.
3418331 3419540 You have to understand...
3419790 3423126 ...most of these people are not<br />ready to be unplugged.
3423377 3424961 And many of them are so inert...
3425212 3427631 ...so hopelessly dependent<br />on the system...
3427882 3430593 ...that they will fight to protect it.
3432094 3435847 Were you listening to me or looking<br />at the woman in the red dress?
3436015 3437766 -I was--<br />-Look again.
3439018 3440102 Freeze it.
3446734 3448360 NEO: This isn't the Matrix?<br />MORPHEUS: No.
3450154 3453991 It's another training program<br />designed to teach you one thing:
3454617 3457036 If you are not one of us,<br />you are one of them.
3457578 3460372 -What are they?<br />-Sentient programs.
3461123 3465418 They can move in and out of any<br />software still hardwired to their system.
3465795 3469173 That means that anyone<br />we haven't unplugged...
3469507 3470841 ...is potentially an agent.
3471801 3473636 Inside the Matrix...
3474220 3475930 ...they are everyone...
3476263 3477973 ...and they are no one.
3478224 3481352 We have survived by hiding<br />and running from them...
3481602 3483228 ...but they are the gatekeepers.
3483479 3486440 They're guarding all the doors<br />and holding all the keys.
3486691 3489527 Sooner or later, someone will<br />have to fight them.
3489694 3490903 Someone?
3491237 3492655 MORPHEUS:<br />I won't lie to you, Neo.
3493114 3497614 Every single man or woman who<br />has fought an agent, has died.
3498202 3500579 But where they have failed,<br />you will succeed.
3500746 3501830 Why?
3502081 3504374 MORPHEUS: I've seen an agent punch<br />through a concrete wall.
3504625 3508211 Men have emptied entire clips at them<br />and hit nothing but air.
3508462 3512962 Yet their strength and speed are still<br />based in a world built on rules.
3513342 3514468 Because of that...
3514719 3518097 ...they will never be as strong<br />or as fast as you can be.
3522393 3524269 What are you telling me?
3524979 3526438 That I can dodge bullets?
3528441 3529817 No, Neo.
3530317 3533236 I'm trying to tell you<br />that when you're ready...
3534113 3535447 ...you won't have to.
3536782 3538283 [PHONE RINGS]
3539577 3540786 TANK:<br /><i>We got trouble.</i>
3559722 3562182 -Did Zion send the warning?<br />-No, another ship.
3565436 3566728 Shit.
3566979 3569856 -Squiddy's sweeping in quick.<br />-Squiddy?
3570066 3573277 A sentinel. A killing machine<br />designed for one thing.
3573527 3574736 Search and destroy.
3576072 3577239 Set her down there.
3598511 3600012 How are we doing, Tank?
3608729 3609896 Power <i>off</i>-line.
3610397 3612357 EMP armed...
3612900 3614443 -...and ready.<br />-EMP?
3614735 3616611 Electromagnetic pulse.
3616862 3619739 Disables any electrical system<br />in the blast radius.
3619907 3622200 It's the only weapon we have<br />against the machines.
3627998 3631126 NEO: Where are we?<br />-Their old service and waste systems.
3632378 3633504 Sewers.
3633712 3636423 TRINITY: There used to be cities<br />that spanned hundreds of miles.
3636924 3638842 Now these sewers are<br />all that's left.
3639093 3640427 Quiet.
3681010 3682469 Whoa! Neo.
3684305 3686473 You scared the bejesus out of me.
3687558 3689476 -Sorry.<br />-It's okay.
3691979 3693230 Is that...?
3693480 3695064 The Matrix?
3695232 3696441 Yeah.
3698235 3701404 -Do you always look at it encoded?<br />-Well, you have to.
3701655 3704741 The image translators work<br />for the construct program.
3704992 3708412 But there's way too much information<br />to decode the Matrix.
3708662 3711623 You get used to it.<br />I don't even see the code.
3711874 3715294 All I see is blonde, brunette, redhead.
3716462 3717838 Do you...
3718130 3719214 ...want a drink?
3719465 3720507 Sure.
3724053 3725512 You know...
3726430 3727973 ...I know what you're thinking.
3728224 3730309 Because right now I'm thinking<br />the same thing.
3730643 3733979 Actually, I've been thinking it<br />ever since I got here.
3735898 3738901 Why, oh, why didn't I take<br />the blue pill?
3749453 3750704 [COUGHS]
3751288 3753206 Good shit, huh?
3753540 3754749 Dozer makes it.
3755209 3756376 It's good for two things:
3756627 3759713 Degreasing engines and<br />killing brain cells.
3760714 3762924 So can I ask you something?
3765928 3767554 Did he tell you why he did it?
3770182 3772017 Why you're here?
3775688 3777439 Jesus!
3778649 3780567 What a mind job.
3781986 3784780 So you're here to save the world.
3786282 3788367 What do you say<br />to something like that?
3793539 3794915 A little piece of advice.
3796709 3798127 You see an agent...
3798460 3800753 ...you do what we do:
3801088 3802631 Run.
3802965 3804716 You run your ass off.
3811974 3813684 Thanks for the drink.
3818397 3819564 Sweet dreams.
3823569 3826989 SMITH:<br />Do we have a deal, Mr. Reagan?
3827656 3828782 You know...
3830200 3832660 ...I know this steak doesn't exist.
3833662 3836414 I know that when I put it<br />in my mouth...
3836665 3839751 ...the Matrix is telling my brain<br />that it is...
3840044 3841170 ...juicy...
3841462 3843172 ...and delicious.
3846091 3847342 After nine years...
3848385 3849928 ...you know what I realize?
3857770 3858979 Ignorance is bliss.
3864026 3865861 Then we have a deal.
3868364 3870282 I don't want to remember nothing.
3870532 3873034 Nothing. You understand?
3876914 3878916 And I want to be rich.
3880250 3882961 You know, someone important.
3884463 3885589 Like an actor.
3886799 3889927 Whatever you want, Mr. Reagan.
3892096 3893639 Okay.
3894014 3896433 You get my body<br />back in a power plant...
3896809 3898560 ...reinsert me into the Matrix...
3898894 3900312 ...I'll get you what you want.
3900562 3902564 Access codes to the Zion mainframe.
3902815 3904983 No. I told you, I don't know them.
3907945 3909947 I can get you the man who does.
3910697 3912490 Morpheus.
3922584 3926045 Here you go, buddy.<br />Breakfast of champions.
3927381 3930175 Close your eyes, it feels<br />like you're eating runny eggs.
3930384 3932094 Or a bowl of snot.
3932636 3934220 MOUSE:<br />You know what it reminds me of?
3936056 3938391 Tastee Wheat. Did you<br />ever eat Tastee Wheat?
3939017 3940727 No, but technically,<br />neither did you.
3940978 3943021 That's exactly my point. Exactly.
3943272 3944648 Because you have to wonder...
3944898 3948151 ...how do the machines really know<br />what Tastee Wheat tasted like?
3948402 3949820 Maybe they got it wrong.
3950070 3953281 Maybe what I think Tastee Wheat<br />tasted like, actually tasted like...
3953574 3955576 ...oatmeal or tuna fish.
3955951 3958787 That makes you wonder.<br />Take chicken, for example.
3959037 3961039 Maybe they didn't know<br />what to make it taste like...
3961290 3963333 ...which is why it tastes<br />like everything.
3963584 3965377 -And maybe they--<br />-Shut up.
3967004 3968463 DOZER:<br />It's a single-celled protein...
3968714 3971758 ...combined with synthetic aminos,<br />vitamins and minerals.
3972009 3973260 Everything the body needs.
3973510 3976387 It doesn't have everything<br />the body needs.
3979141 3982227 I understand you've run through<br />the agent training program.
3983270 3985313 You know, I wrote that program.
3985606 3986898 Here it comes.
3987149 3989109 MOUSE: What did you think of her?<br />NEO: Of who?
3989485 3992529 The woman in the red dress.<br />I designed her.
3992863 3995615 She doesn't talk very much...
3995866 3999828 ...but if you'd like to meet her,<br />I can arrange a more personal milieu.
4000078 4001454 The digital pimp hard at work.
4001705 4003957 Pay no attention to<br />these hypocrites, Neo.
4005250 4007085 To deny our own impulses...
4007336 4010464 ...is to deny the very thing<br />that makes us human.
4012382 4013758 Dozer, when you're done...
4013967 4015551 ...bring the ship up to broadcast depth.
4016136 4017470 We're going in.
4018180 4019598 I'm taking Neo to see her.
4023519 4024770 See who?
4025771 4027022 The Oracle.
4032528 4034071 Everyone please observe...
4034404 4037115 ...the "fasten seat belt"<br />and "no smoking" signs are on.
4037616 4040994 Sit back and enjoy your flight.
4041245 4043038 [PHONE RINGS]
4065435 4066436 We're in.
4082077 4083244 We'll be back in an hour.
4086748 4089292 [PHONE DIALS, THEN RINGS]
4098010 4100012 MORPHEUS:<br />Unbelievable...
4100262 4101596 ...isn't it?
4105183 4107018 NEO: God!<br />-What?
4107686 4109062 I used to eat there.
4111315 4112941 Really good noodles.
4117738 4120240 I have these memories from my life.
4122701 4124369 None of them happened.
4125078 4126329 What does that mean?
4126580 4128790 That the Matrix cannot tell you<br />who you are.
4129708 4130917 But an oracle can?
4131376 4132585 That's different.
4137299 4138550 Did you go to her?
4140093 4141260 TRINITY:<br />Yes.
4141762 4143138 What did she tell you?
4146391 4147892 She told me...
4148935 4150102 What?
4153899 4155233 MORPHEUS:<br />We're here.
4155609 4157902 Neo, come with me.
4177881 4180300 So is this the same oracle<br />that made...
4180467 4181718 ...the prophecy?
4181968 4186305 Yes. She's very old. She's been<br />with us since the beginning.
4186765 4188767 NEO: The beginning?<br />-Of the Resistance.
4191019 4193396 And she knows what? Everything?
4195440 4197358 She would say she knows enough.
4198485 4200278 And she's never wrong.
4202489 4205658 MORPHEUS: Try not to think of it<br />in terms of right and wrong.
4205992 4207576 She is a guide, Neo.
4207953 4209829 She can help you to find the path.
4210330 4211581 She helped you?
4212290 4213332 Yes.
4214084 4215418 What did she tell you?
4217879 4220089 That I would find the One.
4233228 4235355 I told you I can only<br />show you the door.
4236064 4238149 You have to walk through it.
4241945 4243029 Hello, Neo.
4243280 4244948 You're right on time.
4252873 4256668 Make yourself at home, Morpheus.<br />Neo, come with me.
4262340 4263924 These are the other Potentials.
4264176 4265719 You can wait here.
4306551 4309095 BOY:<br />Do not try and bend the spoon.
4309471 4311598 That's impossible.
4312432 4316436 Instead, only try<br />to realize the truth.
4316978 4318354 What truth?
4318605 4320273 There is no spoon.
4322859 4324193 There is no spoon?
4324444 4328906 Then you'll see that it is not the spoon<br />that bends. It is only yourself.
4344965 4346424 The Oracle will you see now.
4357143 4358686 ORACLE:<br />I know you're Neo.
4359312 4360479 Be right with you.
4361523 4363900 -You're the Oracle?<br />-Bingo.
4366611 4369488 Not quite what you<br />were expecting, right?
4370532 4372700 Almost done.
4375203 4376829 Smell good, don't they?
4378081 4379332 Yeah.
4379583 4381418 ORACLE:<br />I'd ask you to sit down...
4381668 4384045 ...but you're not going to anyway.
4384546 4387423 -And don't worry about the vase.<br />-What vase?
4390552 4391719 That vase.
4392679 4393721 I'm sorry.
4393972 4395848 I said, don't worry about it.
4397017 4398977 I'll get one of my kids to fix it.
4399603 4400812 How did you know?
4402856 4406651 What's really going to bake<br />your noodle later on is...
4406985 4409946 ...would you still have broken it<br />if I hadn't said anything?
4414743 4416661 You're cuter than I thought.
4419706 4421958 I can see why she likes you.
4422834 4423918 Who?
4424169 4426004 Not too bright, though.
4429299 4432385 You know why Morpheus<br />brought you to see me.
4434512 4435679 So...
4436640 4438016 ...what do you think?
4439851 4441602 Do you think you are the One?
4443563 4444605 I don't know.
4448026 4449444 You know what that means?
4450278 4451445 It's Latin.
4451821 4454031 Means, "Know thyself."
4455492 4457452 I'll let you in on a little secret.
4459704 4463541 Being the One is just<br />like being in love.
4464250 4467127 No one can tell you you're in love.<br />You just know it...
4467379 4468505 ...through and through.
4468838 4470881 Balls to bones.
4473218 4474260 Well...
4476221 4478306 ...I'd better have a look at you.
4479641 4481142 Open your mouth. Say, "Ah."
4495532 4497200 Okay...
4497826 4502326 Now I'm supposed to say,<br />"Hmm, that's interesting, but..."
4503289 4504415 Then you say:
4505083 4506292 But what?
4506543 4510505 But you already know<br />what I'm going to tell you.
4511923 4514884 -I'm not the One.<br />-Sorry, kid.
4516511 4518513 You got the gift...
4519431 4521724 ...but it looks like<br />you're waiting for something.
4526396 4527438 What?
4527689 4530566 Your next life, maybe. Who knows?
4531151 4533403 That's the way these things go.
4534279 4536864 -What's funny?<br />-Morpheus.
4540326 4542036 He almost had me convinced.
4542287 4543413 I know.
4544956 4547083 Poor Morpheus.
4549461 4552589 Without him, we're lost.
4554132 4556300 What do you mean, "without him"?
4560305 4562223 Are you sure you want<br />to hear this?
4564434 4567186 Morpheus believes in you, Neo.
4568897 4571065 And no one, not you, not even me...
4571316 4573568 ...can convince him otherwise.
4573943 4576320 He believes it so blindly...
4576613 4580950 ...that he's going to sacrifice<br />his life to save yours.
4581159 4582326 What?
4582494 4585163 ORACLE: You're going to<br />have to make a choice.
4585789 4589375 In the one hand,<br />you'll have Morpheus' life.
4589876 4592753 And in the other hand,<br />you'll have your own.
4594172 4596465 One of you is going to die.
4598551 4601845 Which one will be up to you.
4603223 4605141 I'm sorry, kiddo. I really am.
4605391 4607059 You have a good soul.
4608144 4610855 And I hate giving<br />good people bad news.
4613983 4615442 Don't worry about it.
4615693 4618112 As soon as you<br />step outside that door...
4618363 4620490 ...you'll start feeling better.
4621199 4624994 You'll remember you don't believe<br />in any of this fate crap.
4625829 4628581 You're in control of your own life.
4629415 4630707 Remember?
4632377 4633586 Here...
4635463 4637006 ...take a cookie.
4637549 4640885 I promise, by the time<br />you're done eating it...
4641845 4644222 ...you'll feel right as rain.
4653439 4654773 What was said...
4655400 4656859 ...was for you...
4657402 4659237 ...and for you alone.

4682177 4683261 They're on the way.
4713082 4714124 What is that?
4728890 4730308 Oh, déjà vu.
4733811 4734895 What did you just say?
4735146 4736647 Nothing.<br />Just déjá vu.
4736898 4738524 TRINITY: What did you see?<br />CYPHER: What happened?
4739943 4742111 A black cat went past us...
4742362 4743988 ...then another just like it.
4744239 4745782 Was it the same cat?
4746741 4749577 -I'm not sure.<br />-Switch, Apoc.
4753665 4754874 What is it?
4755124 4759545 A déjà vu is usually a glitch in the<br />Matrix when they change something.
4762507 4763758 Oh, my God.
4765551 4766552 Let's go.
4771808 4773601 They cut the hard line.<br />It's a trap! Get out!
4779065 4780316 Oh, no.
4820606 4823066 CYPHER: That's what they changed.<br />We're trapped.
4823318 4825194 MORPHEUS:<br />Be calm. Give me your phone.
4825445 4826988 TRINITY:<br />They'll be able to track it.
4827238 4828656 MORPHEUS:<br />We have no choice.
4830074 4831283 Operator.
4831617 4834453 MORPHEUS: <i>Find a structural drawing of<br />this building. Find it fast.</i>
4842295 4844880 -Got it!<br />MORPHEUS: <i>I need the main wet-wall.</i>
4847717 4848968 Eighth floor.
4849177 4850761 SMITH:<br /><i>They're on the eighth floor.</i>
4851054 4852513 MORPHEUS:<br />Switch, straight ahead.
4853264 4854431 APOC:<br />Neo...
4860563 4862690 I hope the Oracle<br />gave you some good news.
4870990 4872491 TANK:<br /><i>Now left. That's it.</i>
4872784 4873826 MORPHEUS:<br />Good.
4883544 4884836 Where are they?
4928131 4929173 [COUGHS]
4943521 4945105 [SNEEZES]
4945273 4946440 They're in the walls.
4947900 4949067 COP:<br />In the walls!
4970465 4972133 It's an agent!
4979432 4980766 Morpheus!
4980933 4982184 MORPHEUS:<br />You must get Neo out!
4982435 4984270 He's all that matters!
4984562 4986772 -No, Morpheus! Don't!<br />-Trinity, go!
4987732 4989066 Go!
4995323 4997241 -We can't leave him!<br />-We have to!
5021557 5023350 Cypher, come on!
5028272 5032109 The great Morpheus.<br />We meet at last.
5032652 5033778 And you are?
5034028 5035779 A Smith.
5036030 5037322 Agent Smith.
5037907 5039950 You all look the same to me.
5095590 5096882 Take him.
5103514 5104973 No!
5110104 5111939 -Operator.<br />CYPHER: <i>I need an exit, fast.</i>
5114025 5116944 There was an accident.<br />Goddamn car accident.
5117278 5119071 CYPHER:<br /><i>All of a sudden, boom.</i>
5119322 5120698 Somebody up there still likes me.
5120948 5122199 TANK:<br />I got you.
5122700 5124618 CYPHER:<br /><i>Just get me out of here fast.</i>
5124869 5127538 Nearest exit, Franklin and Erie.<br />An old TV repair shop.
5127788 5128830 Right.
5131959 5133543 -Operator.<br />TRINITY: <i>Tank, it's me.</i>
5133794 5134961 Is Morpheus alive?
5135338 5136630 Is Morpheus alive, Tank?
5137048 5138966 <i>Yes. They're moving him.<br />I don't know where.</i>
5139175 5141468 He's alive. We need an exit.
5141719 5142803 You're not far from Cypher.
5142970 5144221 TRINITY: <i>Cypher?</i><br />-I know.
5144472 5146557 <i>-I sent him to Franklin and Erie.</i><br />-Got it.
5154357 5155399 [PHONE RINGS]
5155650 5156859 TANK:<br />Got him.
5167787 5168829 Where are they?
5169080 5170331 Making the call.
5170998 5172165 Good.
5173125 5174835 [PHONE RINGS]
5185304 5186555 You first.
5189767 5190976 Shit!
5194271 5195939 Tank!
5196107 5197733 No!
5199652 5201820 I don't know. It just went dead.
5207618 5210245 [PHONE RINGING]
5228639 5229848 CYPHER:<br /><i>Hello, Trinity.</i>
5230266 5231600 Cypher? Where's Tank?
5237189 5238231 You know...
5239942 5242069 ...for a long time...
5243279 5246156 ...I thought I was in love with you.
5246949 5248992 <i>I used to dream about you.</i>
5250077 5252788 You're a beautiful woman, Trinity.
5253038 5255415 <i>Too bad things had to<br />turn out this way.</i>
5255958 5257000 You killed them.
5257501 5259002 -What?<br />-Oh, God.
5259253 5260671 I'm tired, Trinity.
5262089 5263965 I'm tired of this war...
5264258 5267094 ...tired of fighting.<br />I'm tired of this ship...
5267428 5271928 ...of being cold, of eating<br />the same goddamn goop every day.
5274268 5275394 But most of all...
5275978 5279356 <i>...I'm tired of that jackoff<br />and all of his bullshit.</i>
5280483 5281775 Surprise, asshole!
5282318 5284528 I bet you never saw this coming...
5284779 5285821 ...did you?
5288115 5290492 God, I wish I could be there...
5291076 5292577 ...when they break you.
5293621 5296790 I wish I could walk in<br />just when it happens...
5297500 5299210 ...so right then...
5299460 5300794 ...you'd know it was me.
5301295 5302462 You gave them Morpheus.
5302713 5304172 <i>He lied to us, Trinity.</i>
5304757 5306258 He tricked us!
5306801 5308803 If you had told us the truth...
5309053 5311930 ...we would've told you to shove<br />that red pill up your ass!
5312181 5314308 That is not true, Cypher.<br />He set us free.
5314558 5317435 "Free." You call this free?
5319855 5322357 All I do is what he tells me to do.
5323943 5326862 If I had to choose between<br />that and the Matrix...
5328030 5329239 ...I choose the Matrix.
5329490 5331158 The Matrix isn't real.
5331408 5332826 <i>I disagree, Trinity.</i>
5333077 5335329 I think the Matrix...
5335663 5338248 ...can be more real than this world.
5340417 5342919 All I do is pull the plug here.
5343295 5344504 But there...
5345047 5347340 <i>...you have to watch Apoc die.</i>
5348342 5349593 Trinity.
5355099 5358060 <i>-Welcome to the real world.</i><br />-But you're out, Cypher.
5358310 5360729 <i>-You can't go back.</i><br />-That's what you think.
5360980 5362481 <i>They'll reinsert my body.</i>
5362731 5366359 <i>I go back to sleep. When I wake up,<br />I won't remember a thing.</i>
5366569 5367611 By the way...
5367862 5370823 ...if you have anything important<br />to say to Switch...
5371323 5372407 <i>...say it now.</i>
5372658 5375702 -No, please don't.<br />-Not like this.
5377413 5379039 Not like this.
5383502 5384544 Too late.
5385296 5386588 Goddamn you, Cypher!
5386839 5388715 Don't hate me, Trinity.
5389091 5390967 I'm just a messenger.
5391385 5394554 And right now,<br />I'm going to prove it to you.
5395639 5397307 If Morpheus was right...
5397850 5399726 ...there's no way<br />I can pull this plug.
5400311 5401812 <i>If Neo's the One...</i>
5402313 5404148 <i>...then there'd have to be...</i>
5404398 5406983 ...some kind of a miracle to stop me.
5407151 5408360 Right?
5408986 5411071 I mean, how can he be the One...
5411238 5412322 ...if he's dead?
5413699 5415951 <i>You never did answer me before...</i>
5416243 5418578 <i>...if you bought into<br />Morpheus' bullshit.</i>
5418954 5422165 Come on. All I want<br />is a little yes or no.
5423542 5425877 Look into his eyes...
5426629 5428130 <i>...those big, pretty eyes...</i>
5430883 5432217 ...and tell me...
5432927 5434178 <i>.--yes...</i>
5434511 5435887 <i>.--or no.</i>
5437181 5438724 -Yes.<br /><i>-No!</i>
5438891 5440058 I don't believe it.
5441477 5445977 Believe it or not, you piece of shit,<br />you're still going to burn!
5453405 5454656 [PHONE RINGS]
5464500 5465876 You first.
5474093 5476386 -You're hurt.<br />-I'll be all right.
5479181 5480348 Dozer?
5498617 5500994 SMITH:<br />Have you ever stood and stared at it?
5501870 5504998 Marveled at its beauty...
5505374 5507626 ...its genius?
5508794 5510670 Billions of people...
5510921 5513673 ...just living out their lives.
5514717 5516385 Oblivious.
5520973 5523850 Did you know that the first Matrix...
5524101 5528601 ...was designed to be a perfect<br />human world where none suffered...
5529273 5532192 ...where everyone would be happy.
5532735 5534236 It was a disaster.
5534486 5538823 No one would accept the program.<br />Entire crops were lost.
5539700 5541451 Some believe that...
5541702 5546081 ...we lacked the programming language<br />to describe your perfect world.
5546331 5547874 But I believe that...
5548042 5549209 ...as a species...
5549460 5553297 ...human beings define<br />their reality through misery...
5553547 5554923 ...and suffering.
5555174 5557885 So the perfect world was a dream...
5558135 5562635 ...that your primitive cerebrum<br />kept trying to wake up from.
5564308 5567978 Which is why the Matrix was<br />redesigned to this.
5568437 5569938 The peak...
5570189 5571607 ...of your civilization.
5571857 5574109 I say, "your civilization"...
5574359 5578488 ...because when we started thinking<br />for you, it became our civilization...
5578739 5581825 ...which is, of course,<br />what this is all about.
5583160 5585745 Evolution, Morpheus.
5586038 5587372 Evolution.
5589666 5591542 Like the dinosaur.
5593712 5595338 Look out that window.
5596048 5598175 You had your time.
5598884 5602804 The future is our world, Morpheus.
5603138 5605515 The future is our time.
5609770 5610937 There could be a problem.
5611855 5615233 NEO: What are they doing to him?<br />-They're breaking into his mind.
5615484 5617652 It's like hacking a computer.<br />All it takes is time.
5617903 5619112 How much time?
5619363 5622491 Depends on the mind.<br />But eventually, it'll crack...
5622741 5627162 ...and his alpha patterns<br />will change from this to this.
5627412 5630373 When it does, he'll tell them<br />anything they want to know.
5630624 5631666 What do they want?
5631917 5635962 The leader of every ship is given<br />codes to Zion's mainframe computer.
5636213 5639132 If an agent got the codes<br />and got into Zion's mainframe...
5639383 5642469 ...they could destroy us.<br />We can't let that happen.
5642636 5644888 Trinity, Zion's more important than me...
5645055 5646222 ...or you...
5646390 5647682 ...or even Morpheus.
5651478 5653146 There has to be<br />something we can do.
5653564 5655566 There is. We pull the plug.
5658652 5660403 You're going to kill him?
5660654 5661821 Kill Morpheus?
5662447 5664073 We don't have a choice.
5670873 5673792 Never send a human<br />to do a machine's job.
5674042 5675793 If the insider has failed...
5676044 5679255 ...they'll sever the connection<br />as soon as possible, unless--
5679506 5681216 They're dead. In either case--
5681466 5685011 We have no choice. Continue as planned.<br />Deploy the sentinels.
5685262 5686346 Immediately.
5691602 5694271 Morpheus, you were more<br />than a leader to us.
5695230 5697440 You were a father.
5698984 5700944 We'll miss you always.
5707826 5709035 Stop!
5710204 5711538 I don't believe this is happening.
5711705 5713748 -Neo, this has to be done.<br />NEO: Does it?
5714541 5715917 I don't know.
5716251 5718711 -This can't be just coincidence.<br />-What?
5718921 5720172 NEO:<br />The Oracle.
5720422 5722215 She told me this would happen.
5722633 5726803 She told me that I would<br />have to make a choice.
5727262 5728471 What choice?
5731475 5733977 -What are you doing?<br />-I'm going in.
5734311 5736646 TRINITY: No, you're not.<br />-I have to.
5736855 5740483 Neo, Morpheus sacrificed himself<br />so that we could get you out.
5740734 5742652 There is no way<br />that you're going back in.
5743237 5746490 Morpheus did what he did because<br />he believed I'm something I'm not.
5747991 5749033 What?
5749743 5751369 I'm not the One, Trinity.
5751745 5754706 -The Oracle hit me with that too.<br />-No, you have to be.
5754957 5757626 I'm sorry, I'm not.<br />I'm just another guy.
5758293 5759544 No, Neo, that's not true.
5760128 5762755 -It can't be true.<br />-Why?
5767177 5770513 This is loco. They've got Morpheus<br />in a military-controlled building.
5770764 5775143 Even if you somehow got inside, those<br />are agents holding him. Three of them.
5776436 5780356 I want Morpheus back too, but<br />what you're talking about is suicide.
5780607 5782191 That's what it looks like...
5782359 5783401 ...but it's not.
5783652 5786029 I can't explain to you why it's not.
5787114 5790826 Morpheus believed something, and<br />he was ready to give his life for it.
5791076 5794079 I understand that now.<br />That's why I have to go.
5794371 5796873 -Why?<br />-Because I believe in something.
5797040 5798666 What?
5799376 5801086 I believe I can bring him back.
5818061 5819979 -What are you doing?<br />-Going with you.
5820272 5822274 -No, you're not.<br />-"No"?
5823442 5825569 Let me tell you what I believe.
5826069 5828446 Morpheus means more to me<br />than he does to you.
5828780 5833075 I believe if you are serious about<br />saving him, you will need my help.
5833327 5835370 And since I am the ranking officer...
5835620 5838497 ...if you don't like it,<br />I believe you can go to hell.
5839249 5841668 Because you aren't going anywhere else.
5842085 5843628 Tank...
5843795 5844921 ...load us up.
5854556 5857850 I'd like to share<br />a revelation that I've had...
5858268 5859811 ...during my time here.
5860062 5864066 It came to me when I tried<br />to classify your species...
5864316 5866568 ...and I realized...
5866818 5869111 ...that you're not actually mammals.
5871323 5873783 Every mammal on this planet...
5874117 5878617 ...instinctively develops an equilibrium<br />with the surrounding environment.
5879289 5881124 But you humans do not.
5881666 5885211 You move to an area<br />and you multiply...
5885462 5889962 ...and multiply until every<br />natural resource is consumed.
5890300 5892385 The only way you can survive...
5892677 5895638 ...is to spread to another area.
5901061 5903938 There is another organism<br />on this planet...
5904189 5906149 ...that follows the same pattern.
5906775 5908443 Do you know what it is?
5908819 5910654 A virus.
5911988 5915032 Human beings are a disease.
5915409 5916952 A cancer of this planet.
5917202 5919329 You are a plague.
5919871 5921289 And we...
5921456 5922832 ...are the cure.
5923834 5925252 Okay, so what do you need?
5925877 5927003 Besides a miracle.
5927587 5928796 Guns.
5929631 5930840 Lots of guns.
5940725 5941934 Neo...
5943687 5946231 No one has ever done<br />anything like this.
5947441 5949359 That's why it's going to work.
5953447 5955365 Why isn't the serum working?
5955991 5958284 Perhaps we're asking<br />the wrong questions.
5960370 5961621 Leave me with him.
5964207 5965333 Now.
5976553 5978137 TANK:<br />Hold on, Morpheus.
5978388 5981099 They're coming for you.<br />They're coming.
5983477 5985604 SMITH:<br />Can you hear me, Morpheus?
5985854 5988523 I'm going to be honest...
5988899 5990108 ...with you.
5994488 5995906 I...
5996781 5997907 ...hate...
5998158 6000118 ...this place...
6000452 6002745 ...this zoo...
6002996 6004122 ...this prison...
6004372 6007541 ...this reality,<br />whatever you want to call it.
6007792 6010085 I can't stand it any longer.
6010837 6012713 It's the smell.
6014090 6015966 If there is such a thing.
6016301 6019595 I feel saturated by it.
6021097 6022389 I can...
6022641 6024184 ...taste...
6024351 6026394 ...your stink.
6026645 6030273 And every time I do, I fear that<br />I have somehow been infected by it.
6030440 6031441 It's repulsive.
6032442 6033818 Isn't it?
6035987 6038280 I must get out of here.
6038698 6040908 I must get free.
6041159 6044036 And in this mind is the key.
6044287 6045955 My key.
6046206 6049083 Once Zion is destroyed,<br />there is no need for me to be here.
6049334 6050960 Do you understand?
6051253 6052629 I need the codes.
6052879 6055214 I have to get inside Zion...
6055549 6058051 ...and you have to tell me how.
6058468 6060344 You're going to tell me...
6060595 6062763 ...or you're going to die.
6082951 6086079 Please remove any metallic items<br />you're carrying. Keys, loose change.
6090000 6091042 Holy shit!
6103138 6105849 Backup. Send backup.
6129664 6130790 Freeze!
6265633 6266842 What were you doing?
6268678 6269970 He doesn't know.
6270221 6271722 Know what?
6299793 6302295 I think they're trying to save him.
6317143 6318894 There is no spoon.
6348508 6350676 Find them and destroy them!
6352303 6354138 We're under attack!
6386254 6387421 Trinity!
6387922 6389006 Help!
6411029 6412238 Only human.
6413197 6414281 Dodge this.
6427503 6429004 -How did you do that?<br />-Do what?
6429422 6433342 You moved like they do.<br />I've never seen anyone move that fast.
6434469 6435845 It wasn't fast enough.
6438598 6439890 Can you fly that thing?
6441017 6442018 Not yet.
6445313 6446355 Operator.
6446564 6449733 TRINITY: <i>I need a pilot program<br />for a B-212 helicopter.</i>

6476135 6477219 No.
6528813 6531440 Morpheus, get up.<br />Get up, get up.
6569479 6570521 He's not going to make it.
6580323 6581365 Got you.
6647431 6648598 Trinity!
6690266 6691684 I knew it.
6692310 6693519 He's the One.
6709493 6711703 Do you believe it now, Trinity?
6714582 6715749 Morpheus...
6717418 6718502 The Oracle.
6719754 6722131 -She told me--<br />-She told you...
6722506 6724090 ...what you needed to hear.
6724383 6725717 That's all.
6726761 6729722 Sooner or later you'll realize,<br />just as I did...
6730056 6732349 ...there's a difference<br />between knowing the path...
6733100 6734392 ...and walking the path.
6737438 6738647 -Operator.<br />MORPHEUS: <i>Tank.</i>
6739565 6742109 -It's good to hear your voice.<br /><i>-We need an exit.</i>
6742360 6745154 Got one ready. Subway station,<br />State and Balboa.
6758209 6760628 -Damn it!<br />-The trace was completed.
6760878 6764464 -We have their position.<br />-Sentinels are standing by.
6766175 6767676 Order the strike.

6787405 6788739 You first, Morpheus.
6809427 6811720 Neo, I want to tell you something...
6814974 6818936 ...but I'm afraid of<br />what it could mean if I do.

6822523 6825817 Everything the Oracle<br />told me has come true.

6857558 6858725 Neo!
6858976 6860602 -What happened?<br />TRINITY: An agent.

6868986 6870362 Run, Neo. Run.
6875659 6877285 What is he doing?
6877536 6878787 He's beginning to believe.
6905773 6907149 You're empty.
6907733 6909025 So are you.
6942184 6945187 I'm going to enjoy watching you die...
6946313 6947355 ...Mr. Anderson.
6988314 6990399 Jesus, he's killing him.
7076569 7078696 You hear that, Mr. Anderson?
7079446 7082449 That is the sound of inevitability.
7085035 7088371 It is the sound of your death.
7089290 7091625 Goodbye, Mr. Anderson.
7091875 7093501 My name...
7096505 7098548 ...is Neo.

7151143 7153395 -How long?<br />-Five, maybe six minutes.
7155439 7157607 Tank, charge the EMP.
7157858 7160902 -We can't use that until he's out.<br />MORPHEUS: I know. Don't worry.
7162071 7163155 He's gonna make it.
7163405 7165281 Flat or pumps? No, just--
7165532 7168409 What the shit? That's my phone!
7168827 7170411 That guy took my phone!
7172790 7175083 Got him!<br />He's on the run.

7435928 7436970 Neo...
7438430 7440390 I'm not afraid anymore.
7442017 7443351 The Oracle told me...
7443518 7448018 ...I'd fall in love, and that<br />the man I loved would be the One.
7452069 7454029 So you see...
7454738 7456740 ...you can't be dead.
7458325 7460160 You can't be...
