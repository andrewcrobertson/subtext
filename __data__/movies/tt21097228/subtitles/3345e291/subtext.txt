114983 116684 Oh!
121589 123625 Hey. Hey, man, you all right?
123725 125627 You need to lie down<br />or something?
125727 130130 No, this happens<br />from time to time. It'll pass.
131099 133433 Thanks for asking,<br />though.
133534 135335 All right, well just<br />let me know.
135435 137437 I'll be at my desk.
138305 140775 Uh, Mr. Lemuel...
142342 145780 That was maybe on the<br />slightly intense side.
146114 147247 Yeah, we...
147347 151653 I think we want less<br />of an aneurysm-type attack
151753 153353 and more like, uh...
154221 155923 Woozy. You know?
156024 159326 "Oh, oh."
160193 163931 "Oh, oh."
164032 166366 All right? "Oh."
166466 168036 Don't wanna scare people.
168136 169369 Ah. Oh.
169469 171171 Ah. How's that feel?
171906 173808 -Great.<br />-Any notes for me?
173908 175242 Nope, you're great.
179080 183283 Oh. Oh.
184451 186821 Hey. Hey, man,<br />you all right?
186921 187955 Oh.
190625 192927 You, uh, you been<br />at this long?
193761 194529 A little while, I guess.
194629 197431 Mmm. Just got outta Julliard.
197532 201703 This is my first paying gig.<br />My first gig, really.
202904 205472 Mmm. Interesting experience.
221354 222757 I know<br />what you're all thinking,
222857 225927 but you're wrong.<br />I only want directions.
226027 227360 Where's this train<br />headed, huh?
227461 228563 Where's the conductor?
228663 230732 Ask him where<br />this train is bound.
230832 234234 Glory? That's not<br />my ultimate destination.
234334 238305 Fort Lee, New Jersey is<br />my ultimate destination.
238405 240041 I don't know<br />about you suckers,
240141 242076 I got a brother-in-law.
242176 245445 This train is hauling<br />the good, the bad,
245546 248015 and especially<br />the ugly mother fuckers!
248116 249449 So who's gonna be the hero?
249550 251586 -You?<br />-I'm a casting director,
251686 254488 specializing in unique<br />and unusual physiognomies.
254589 256124 - Have you ever considered...<br />- Yeah,
256224 258258 they tell me<br />I got star quality.
258358 260494 I believe that. Here...
266067 267267 Salamunovich says,
267367 268569 "Nah, don't worry about it.<br />It's just a gland."
268669 269604 -Cool, yo...<br />-Hey, hey, 4F,
269704 271304 you keepin' a dog<br />in your apartment?
271404 274175 -No, why?<br />-Must be somebody else.
278146 279647 Hey. Come on, man.
279747 281816 Watch it, watch it,<br />watch it, watch it.
284852 286754 Hey, hey. No, come here.
286854 289056 Feel this. Feel this.
289157 291058 Here.
293326 294796 That seem like a lump to you?
294896 295797 A little lumpy.
295897 297598 You know who<br />this guy reminds me of?
297698 300467 Woody Allen, when he was<br />younger and kind of nervous.
300568 302136 Yeah. He's kind of nervous.
302236 304205 Listen,<br />be confident brother.
304304 306306 Take some Brazilian jiu-jitsu,
306406 309076 or that Krav Maga<br />from Israel shit.
309177 310511 Look, hey, little guy.
310611 314982 All unhappiness in life comes<br />from not accepting what is.
315082 316584 Do you know who told me that?
316684 317885 - Your shrink.<br />- No, I'm serious.
317985 320621 You know who told me<br />that all unhappiness in life
320721 322557 -comes from, uh...<br />-Jesus Christ.
322657 323958 From not accepting<br />what is?
324058 325193 Lady Gaga.
325293 326694 I knew that fucking bitch<br />when she was...
342442 343611 Hi.
344278 345478 Um...
346047 347048 You wanna get there?
348216 349382 Excuse me.
351052 352352 Sorry, he's going...
361028 363331 Jesus Christ, guys...
427128 428963 <i>At its</i><br /><i>most basic level,</i>
429063 430164 <i>whistling is about,</i>
431198 432400 <i>"Put your lips together</i>
432499 433567 <i>- "and blow."</i><br />- Hmm.
433668 434902 <i>Right?</i><br /><i>Everyone knows that.</i>
435002 436771 <i>Every five-year-old</i><br /><i>knows that.</i>
436871 439307 <i>But, obviously, it's more</i><br /><i>complicated than that.</i>
439407 441575 <i>As everyone, uh,</i><br /><i>who's ever tried</i>
441676 442710 <i>to whistle knows,</i>
442810 443978 <i>that if you put</i><br /><i>your lips together...</i>
445880 447447 Oh!
448649 449850 <i>All of these muscles,</i>
449951 454487 <i>uh, the sphincter muscles</i><br /><i>around your lips...</i>
454588 458259 -Hey. Oh, your hand!<br />-Uh...
458359 460127 Um, I just unpacked<br />my first aid kit.
460227 461696 Right back, hold on.
464131 465433 <i>...has something to do...</i>
468869 469971 Got it.
470071 473207 Oh, um, I'll fix that.<br />Don't worry about it.
476877 478746 Can we sit here?
478846 481182 I'm no doctor.<br />I waive all liability.
481282 482683 Do you consent?
482783 484885 Antibacterial ointment<br />and gauze pads
484986 488122 is the extent of my expertise<br />is overstating it.
488222 492460 Oh. Expired. Recently?
492560 493694 It's probably<br />still good though, right?
493794 496030 - Yeah.<br />- Um...
496130 497431 Mmm, paper towels.
497531 499000 - It's bad for the earth.<br />- Uh...
499100 501936 Let's, uh, examine<br />the wound here.
502036 504005 Oh, shi...
504105 505740 Maybe you need stitches?
505840 507875 -What do you think?<br />-I mean...
507975 510511 -Hmm...<br />-What happened to you?
512380 513948 -It's none of my business.<br />-Hmm.
514515 515683 Okay.
516484 517451 Let's see, ugh.
517551 519286 Those assholes<br />and I just stood there
519387 521222 like a moron.
521322 524191 And I thought,<br />"I've got an enemy<br />in my new building."
524658 525893 This will sting.
528529 529730 Did it not sting?
530197 531232 A little.
531332 532666 Okay, that's, that's good.
532767 533801 It's probably good.
533901 537038 -Hmm.<br />-Brave. This is potent stuff.
538706 541275 Okay, um, let's just...
542543 543878 Before it...
544612 546247 Is this okay?
546347 547681 - Hmm?<br />- Oh shit.
547782 548783 I got it on the couch.
548883 550384 -Oh. No, it's okay.<br />-I'm so sorry.
550484 552053 Just tell me<br />if it doesn't come out.
552153 554523 Oh.<br />I got it on my thigh.
554622 556557 That's disgusting.
560327 561762 Hmm.
566934 569637 Oh, you should probably<br />get that checked out.
569737 571705 -Uh...<br />-Your apartment is<br />so lived in.
571806 574308 Yeah. Uh, well, I mean,<br />it, uh, makes sense...
574408 575709 Mine's a war zone.
577611 580147 - Are you from here?<br />- Yeah.
582316 583684 Hmm. I'm from Alesund.
583784 585554 - You heard of that?<br />- Mmm.
585653 587488 Sorry, what was<br />your name again?
587588 589390 - Edward.<br />- E. Lemuel.
589490 591459 I saw it on the mailbox.
591560 592927 I'm Ingrid. Did I say that?
596497 597665 Is that your mom?
598599 599767 Yeah.
600535 601702 Is that you?
602571 603804 Yes.
608109 610377 - Is she alive?<br />- No.
613347 615783 So, what do you do?
615883 618252 Uh, well, I... I was just<br />cutting some onions...
618352 619854 You're a writer.
619954 621822 Oh, I found it on the street.
621922 624892 Really? Looks valuable.
624992 627795 "They taunt me and beg me<br />to show my face,
627895 630097 "only so that when I do,
630197 632666 "they can turn away<br />in horror."
634034 635302 What's that?
635402 637338 I... I was<br />just testing it out.
638806 640040 It's interesting.
641041 643911 Actually, I'm a playwright.
644678 645846 I act.
646447 647748 Amazing.
647848 651385 I'm trying to think if I've,<br />uh, seen you in anything.
652820 655122 Not... Not likely.
655222 658292 Well, maybe we'll ride<br />to glory together.
658392 660928 Maybe.
661028 664298 Oh, uh, do you know who lived<br />in my apartment before me?
664398 666467 -C. Pulaski?<br />-Uh, yeah.
666568 668603 He, uh, came over<br />to, uh, borrow
668702 669770 some laundry detergent.
669870 671939 Uh, old guy. Widower, maybe.
672039 673440 -Did he die?<br />-I didn't...
673542 675176 I didn't know<br />he was, uh, gone.
675276 677912 Actually, this is not<br />why I came over.
678012 680014 But can I borrow<br />some laundry detergent?
682416 683784 Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.
683884 685419 - Yeah?<br />- Sure. I...
687021 687988 Um, yeah.
691292 693460 You learning to whistle?
693562 696197 All in all,<br />things look relatively stable.
696297 697666 Eventually, we'll have<br />to take a look
697765 699668 at the growth<br />over your left eye.
699767 701835 Your vision is<br />noticeably impacted?
701936 703237 I've adjusted.
703337 706040 This makes it two<br />or so years without surgery.
706140 708776 - Much needed respite.<br />- Yeah.
708876 710878 Let's aim for three years.
710978 712780 But I must be frank<br />that sooner or later,
712880 714949 the eye will become<br />debilitating.
715749 717851 As for the cholesteatoma,
717952 719853 I think we should go in<br />and get that thing out.
719954 721556 But the hearing loss<br />is minimal,
721656 724693 so we can probably<br />sit on it for a bit.
724792 726994 Several other tumors have<br />shown minor enlargement,
727094 729430 but no impingement on<br />any important structures.
729531 732433 So, just some things<br />we have to keep an eye on.
733767 735002 I mention this<br />so that you have an idea
735102 737838 of the road ahead,<br />not that it's news to you.
737938 742677 But an alternative path<br />has presented itself.
742776 744646 A colleague of mine,<br />Eugene Flexner,
744745 745714 rather distinguished,
745813 747881 is on the lookout<br />for patients,
747982 749584 a patient like you,
749684 751986 for an experimental<br />drug trial.
752086 754989 This drug seems<br />to have the potential to be,
755089 757258 words like heal<br />and cure are an anathema
757358 760861 to folks in my profession,<br />but to actually heal you,
761395 762763 completely, even.
762863 765734 The implications are<br />life changing for you.
765833 766900 I shouldn't overpromise<br />anything
767001 770337 because it's<br />the first trial I believe.
770437 774808 Perhaps any potential risk is<br />worth the potential reward?
775943 777778 Something to think about.
816083 817885 Oh, hey, neighbor.
818886 821889 Housewarming, for the door.
822856 824793 Didn't your mother give<br />that to you?
824892 826493 No, I... I found it<br />on the street.
827662 830931 Right. Okay.
833535 837004 I just wanna get rid of it,<br />and you're a play writer.
837104 839106 Yeah, but you could<br />probably get some cash for it.
839708 840742 Write me a part.
843310 844244 Yes. Right.
844345 847047 I'll get right on that.<br />No, but thank you.
847147 850217 It's, uh, very heavy,<br />generous.
850317 851720 Thank you.
851820 853287 Hey!
853387 855757 - Hey, man.<br />- Hello. That's my neighbor.
855856 857191 Come in. Thank you again.
857291 858560 - Yep.<br />- Thank you.
881616 882916 Jesus Christ.
892359 895630 Whom else would I love<br />but the most beautiful woman
895730 898132 in the world? Of course.
898232 900200 The most beautiful<br />of all women.
900300 903337 The most captivating,<br />the most intelligent.
905072 907876 Sometimes in the blue shadows<br />of evening,
907975 909711 I give way to tender feelings.
909811 911078 I go into a garden,
911178 912881 smelling the fragrance<br />of spring
912980 915282 with my poor monstrous nose,
915382 919319 and I watch a man and a woman,
919420 921823 strolling together<br />under the moonlight,
921922 926160 and I think how I too,
927595 932065 would like to be arm in arm<br />with a woman under the moon.
935202 937137 I let myself be carried away.
939607 941074 I forget myself.
944679 945713 And then I...
947247 950417 suddenly see<br />the shadow of my...
951185 953086 profile on the garden wall.
986654 989323 <i>Sad as it is,</i><br /><i>it will come as no surprise.</i>
989423 991024 <i>Attractive people are</i><br /><i>the winners</i>
991124 992392 <i>in most areas of life,</i>
992493 994294 <i>and the workplace is</i><br /><i>no exception.</i>
994394 996330 <i>You're likely</i><br /><i>to be startled or perturbed</i>
996430 998031 <i>when you see a face like this.</i>
998131 999500 <i>You might stare tactlessly,</i>

1001636 1004137 <i>even if you're generally</i><br /><i>a kind person.</i>
1004238 1006674 <i>These uneasy feelings</i><br /><i>may diminish or subside</i>
1006774 1007976 <i>after repeated exposure</i>
1008075 1009744 <i>to your facially</i><br /><i>different coworker.</i>
1009844 1012412 <i>Be gentle with yourself</i><br /><i>for having these reactions.</i>
1012514 1015015 <i>We have no control</i><br /><i>over the fight</i>

1020454 1021956 <i>there are strategies</i><br /><i>we can adopt</i>

1023825 1024893 <i>Here, according</i><br /><i>to the experts,</i>
1024993 1026260 <i>are some techniques.</i>
1026360 1028696 <i>Make your disfigured</i><br /><i>coworker feel included</i>
1028796 1030163 <i>on your team's project</i>
1030264 1032399 <i>and make an effort</i><br /><i>to seek their input.</i>
1032499 1034736 Luther, do you have<br />any feedback for Sally?
1034836 1037237 Sounds like an ace idea to me.
1038238 1039807 <i>When appropriate, invite them</i>
1039908 1041009 <i>to social functions.</i>
1041108 1043645 So, Morris,<br />it's my birthday this weekend.
1043745 1045245 Oh, really? How old are you?
1045345 1047381 It's a big one,<br />let's leave it at that.
1047481 1049116 - Mmm.<br />- But I'm, uh, having
1049216 1050985 some people at my place,
1051084 1052954 and I was thinking<br />you should come.
1053086 1054187 Sally will be there.
1054288 1056824 Ace.<br />Thank you for thinking of me.
1056925 1058492 It really means a lot.
1058593 1059861 And you're welcome<br />to bring someone
1059961 1061763 if there's a girl or...
1061863 1063196 Uh, thank you.
1063932 1065733 Happy birthday.
1065833 1067401 <i>Ask how they're</i><br /><i>doing occasionally,</i>
1067502 1070004 <i>as you would ask anyone else.</i>
1070103 1071706 <i>If they appear</i><br /><i>to be in distress,</i>
1071806 1073608 <i>gently inquire</i><br /><i>if they need your help...</i>
1073708 1074876 <i>...without assuming</i>
1074976 1076410 <i>their dependence on you.</i>
1076511 1078546 Hey. Hey, man, you all right?
1078646 1080447 You need to lie down<br />or something?
1080548 1083317 No, this... This happens
1083417 1086286 from time to time. It'll pass.
1087387 1089023 Thanks for asking though.
1089122 1090959 All right, well,<br />just let me know.
1091059 1092225 I'll be at my desk.
1093126 1094696 Hey, have you seen<br />Sally anywhere?
1095495 1096463 No.
1101201 1102503 That's, uh, basically it.
1102604 1105506 -Mmm. Is there more of you?<br />-No.
1107307 1109744 Well, is it...<br />What is it? Is it some...
1109844 1111779 Like they show it in offices?
1111879 1112981 I think something like that.
1113081 1114582 Yeah.
1114682 1116784 Well, it seems like<br />an important tool.
1118285 1120655 And, uh, no,<br />you made an impression.
1120755 1122056 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.
1122155 1123691 We all gotta start somewhere.
1125392 1129063 Yeah. Oh, you have<br />this blackhead on your nose.
1129162 1130330 Oh, I...
1130430 1131666 - Can I get at it?<br />- Uh...
1133133 1135503 It's...<br />I can get it.
1136704 1137672 Can I?
1138405 1140875 Oh, okay.
1140975 1143143 It's... No. I don't have to.
1143243 1144612 No, it's... It's fine.
1144712 1146446 It's, uh, you have<br />very oily skin.
1146547 1147782 I have a good cream for that.
1148616 1150518 -Okay.<br />-Hmm. I'd love to try it.
1150618 1152419 -Yeah?<br />-Sure.
1163798 1167835 So, no more of you<br />in this?
1168268 1170270 -No.<br />-Ah, nope? Okay.
1170370 1171572 Um...
1172339 1175308 I think, uh, I'm gonna...
1175409 1177344 - Hey, I... I'm sorry.<br />- No, don't be sorry.
1177444 1180414 I... I forgot I have<br />this thing, and, uh...
1180515 1182416 I'll talk to you later.<br />See you soon.
1188255 1189289 <i>Psychologists have begun</i>
1189389 1191626 <i>to uncover where disgust</i><br /><i>comes from...</i>
1192660 1193594 <i>...some</i><br /><i>researchers believing</i>
1193695 1195797 <i>the emotion is</i><br /><i>similar to fear.</i>
1195897 1198265 <i>"Fear evolved to keep you</i><br /><i>away from large animals</i>
1198365 1200333 <i>"that want to eat you</i><br /><i>from the outside,"</i>
1200434 1203004 <i>says Valerie Curtis,</i><br /><i>a behavioral scientist</i>
1203104 1205807 <i>at the London School of</i><br /><i>Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.</i>
1214015 1215315 Okay, and then...
1215415 1217085 DR. - Ta-da!
1217185 1218986 Okay. All right.<br />It's just a file photo,
1219087 1221221 but I believe<br />we all get the idea.
1222156 1224391 Uh, all right,<br />let's move on, Dr. Trutz.
1225459 1227161 All right, as you may know,
1227260 1229030 this drug was<br />originally developed
1229130 1230765 as a treatment<br />for androgenic alopecia.
1230865 1233034 It's an area which has<br />shown significant promise.
1233134 1234936 Uh, it's<br />in phase three trials?
1235803 1237505 Uh, but, what we're<br />attempting here,
1237605 1240074 though, of course,<br />for a far more niche market,
1240174 1242309 is a different beast<br />altogether.
1242409 1244545 At the dose that we propose<br />to administer,
1244645 1247481 physical modification<br />of hard and soft tissue,
1247582 1249884 both reductive<br />and augmentative,
1249984 1250918 was observed without the need
1251018 1253320 for manual shaving<br />or grafting.
1253420 1256456 There is the potential<br />to restore form and function
1256557 1258391 to bodies containing<br />a variety of defects,
1258492 1259493 which is paramount
1259594 1261461 to a patient's<br />physical appearance,
1261562 1263330 while reducing<br />the overall cost
1263430 1265933 with only a moderate level<br />of morbidity.
1266033 1268136 There was a non-zero number
1268236 1271438 of wound dehiscence<br />and vessel damage...
1323423 1327061 We'll use this one<br />to measure the progress,
1327161 1330198 and we'll feed<br />any inconsistencies
1330298 1333500 back into the machine.
1333601 1336938 Wow. What a world!
1339339 1341509 Log book.
1341609 1344444 Next to each<br />potential side effect,<br />mark the number.
1344545 1347380 Zero meaning non-existent,<br />one meaning mild,
1347480 1349617 ten meaning...
1349717 1353486 These are going to help<br />protect your kidneys.
1353588 1356524 Take them every four hours<br />on the dot.
1356624 1358226 These could be placebos?
1358326 1359459 These ones, no.
1359560 1362362 Everybody gets these<br />to protect the kidneys.
1362462 1364131 The placebo arms are<br />for the Turpidol
1364232 1365967 and the Ochiprosoponib<br />medication.
1366067 1367068 So theoretically, yes,
1367168 1368435 with those you won't know<br />for sure,
1368536 1370504 but I'd just put that idea<br />out of your head.
1370605 1372940 Now, let's get<br />that bandage changed.
1373774 1374675 Dr. Trutz.
1374775 1377845 Dr. Trutz! Dressing change.
1382083 1383050 This one's...
1383918 1385052 See you tomorrow.
1416617 1418619 And it paid<br />really badly, so...
1420621 1422455 -It wasn't the move.<br />-Wasn't the move.
1422556 1423891 Wasn't the move.
1424258 1426060 Um, I remember...
1426160 1427728 I remember going<br />to some great record stores.
1526460 1527661 <i>It drives me crazy.</i>
1527762 1528929 <i>And you know what I think</i><br /><i>about money I make?</i>
1529030 1530164 <i>I'll tell you what I think</i><br /><i>about money.</i>
1530264 1532533 <i>See this? This is what</i><br /><i>I think about money.</i>
1532633 1534902 <i>This, all right?</i><br /><i>So go ahead then.</i>
1535002 1536704 <i>You ready?</i><br /><i>Throw it up in my face.</i>
1536804 1537972 <i>Come on, do what you say.</i>
1538072 1539273 <i>Say it! Say it!</i>
1539373 1540775 <i>Say how you pay the bills.</i>
1540875 1542410 <i>How you're spending</i><br /><i>your money.</i>
1542511 1543944 <i>How you picked up</i><br /><i>the rent last month.</i>
1544045 1545646 <i>Huh? What do you want me</i><br /><i>to do, get on my knees?</i>
1545746 1547348 <i>You want me to kiss your feet?</i>
1547448 1548783 <i>Well, forget it, man.</i>
1548883 1550384 <i>Because this place</i><br /><i>has been here long</i>
1550484 1551652 <i>before you got me up in here,</i>
1551752 1552820 <i>and it'll be here long</i><br /><i>after you leave.</i>
1552920 1554588 <i>All right? So don't tell me</i><br /><i>about money.</i>
1554688 1555689 <i>And don't tell me about pain,</i>
1555790 1556757 <i>and don't tell me</i><br /><i>when you think</i>
1556857 1558059 <i>it could've been finished.</i>
1558159 1560661 <i>All right? I'll tell you</i><br /><i>when it gets finished.</i>
1560761 1562063 <i>In fact, you'll be</i><br /><i>the first to know.</i>
1562163 1563631 <i>I'll come and tell you, man.</i><br /><i>I'll come over...</i>
1567201 1569170 <i>I'll whisper it.</i><br /><i>Right in your ear, man.</i>
1569270 1570438 <i>I'll say, "It's done!"</i>
1573274 1574543 <i>Ah, come on.</i>
1574642 1576444 <i>I don't wanna spend</i><br /><i>another night</i>
1576545 1579880 <i>just sitting around,</i><br /><i>looking at the TV.</i>
1579980 1582149 <i>We have to.</i><br /><i>We have no money.</i>
1582249 1585653 <i>But I thought</i><br /><i>you got your al...</i>
1585753 1589223 <i>- Ali, Ale, Al...</i><br /><i>- Alimony.</i>
1589323 1591859 <i>Alimony check today.</i>
1591959 1593461 <i>I did,</i><br /><i>but I had to pay rent.</i>
1598933 1601235 <i>We don't have any drugs?</i>
1601335 1603037 <i>We don't have any money?</i>
1603137 1605172 <i>We don't have any...</i>
1606508 1608843 <i>I can't take it anymore!</i>
1608943 1610945 <i>Why don't you call up</i><br /><i>one of your friends</i>
1611045 1612046 <i>and go out?</i>
1614081 1616984 <i>Because I don't have</i><br /><i>any friends.</i>
1624692 1627194 Open the door!
1635936 1638839 No, no. This way. 4B! 4B!
1638939 1640407 Come on.<br />Let's move. Go, go, go.
1643944 1645212 - Snip the thing.<br />- Yeah.
1645312 1646347 Cut it.
1648682 1649950 - You got him?<br />- Yeah.
1650918 1652587 Careful,<br />don't drop him.
1654188 1655956 Oh!
1656056 1657024 I got him. I got him.
1657124 1658292 - Good?<br />- Yep.
1658392 1660261 I'm... I'm good.
1660361 1661495 Yeah, I'm tired man.
1674275 1677878 Okay, set it down.<br />Goodnight, sweet prince.
1677978 1679246 Think this guy was<br />a poet?
1681015 1682683 What were<br />you doing, man?
1683117 1684519 What?
1684619 1685853 <i>Hello?</i>
1686954 1690291 Hey, go around.<br />You gotta go around.
1690391 1691158 Let's go!
1695496 1697431 Learn to park, motherfuckers.
1701202 1702403 Hey, where were you
1702504 1703605 when my mother had a stroke.
1703704 1705339 Hey, come on, guy!
1705439 1707542 Go away. You gotta go back.
1711445 1714583 His name was Ostermeier,<br />according to his mailbox.
1715216 1717952 -Yeah, Ostermeier.<br />-You knew him?
1718553 1719720 No.
1721855 1723257 Would you kill yourself?
1726427 1727828 I don't know, maybe.
1728597 1729830 Depends on the circumstances.
1729930 1732466 Don't say "maybe". Say "no".
1734501 1736470 -Would you?<br />-What a question!
1737639 1739206 I know I asked it first.
1740207 1742276 Hey, what happened<br />to your bandage?
1742376 1743645 Oh, yeah, it healed.
1744345 1747248 It's a miracle.<br />I'm like St. Francis.
1747348 1748617 Guess I chose<br />the wrong profession,
1748717 1750284 and now I'm gonna slash you,
1750384 1752052 get some more practice.
1752654 1755055 Sorry. Nervous Nelly.
1758926 1759860 I'm not scared.
1759960 1762963 Um, what are your plays about?
1763063 1765499 No, don't ask.<br />I'd rather talk about suicide.
1766601 1767868 -Sorry.<br />-No, it's just...
1767968 1769571 It's embarrassing<br />talking about...
1769671 1770904 Especially when it's<br />still in progress.
1771005 1772741 You know,<br />I call myself a writer,
1772840 1776277 but it's...<br />It's sort of aspirational.
1776377 1777811 No, I do write. It's...
1777911 1779013 I've written<br />a few translations
1779113 1780715 by this Italian, though,<br />you wouldn't know him,
1780814 1782816 he's a nobody.<br />I won an award for it.
1782916 1785219 -Small, but, yeah.<br />-Hmm.
1785319 1787955 I'm trying to write<br />my first original play,
1788690 1791191 but I'm still figuring it out.
1791292 1792826 You probably want<br />your typewriter back.
1793961 1796598 Oh, throw it out<br />for all I give a shit.
1796698 1798232 I wouldn't throw it out.
1798332 1801168 At the very least, it makes me<br />looks like a writer.
1801268 1803538 At the very least, it makes me<br />look like a writer.
1804838 1808175 -Its presence mocks me.<br />-Inspires you.
1810144 1811780 That's the most positive<br />thing I've heard you say.
1814582 1816016 What are your favorite plays?
1816917 1819053 Um, I don't know.
1819153 1821488 The one about<br />the, um, selling...
1821589 1824526 The... The seller, salesman.
1825794 1827061 Oh. Mmm-hmm.
1827629 1828862 -Um...<br />-Yeah.
1830030 1833100 I saw a pretty good one<br />on TV about the Nazis.
1833200 1836771 -Which one's that?<br />-I don't remember the name,
1836870 1839106 but it had singing<br />and dancing and Nazis.
1839206 1840575 The Nazis were singing<br />and dancing?
1840675 1842176 No, the, um...
1843611 1845312 -The other...<br />-Jews.
1846313 1847081 I guess so.
1847181 1848583 The Jews were singing<br />and dancing?
1850050 1850984 Yeah, I guess so.
1851085 1853220 Sounds like<br />a weird dream you had.
1854622 1856190 Probably I'm misremembering.
1859993 1861195 Who's that?
1863698 1864998 I don't... I don't know.
1865099 1866500 Why is he waving at you?
1868570 1870270 I... I have no idea.
1872072 1873775 What did he want?
1873874 1875242 Why'd he think he knew you?
1877277 1880548 Sometimes<br />these things happen to me.
1881415 1882416 They do?
1886086 1888088 Well, I'd like<br />to come see the...
1888188 1890190 -Your play when...<br />-You're not gonna see it,
1890290 1891826 you're gonna be in it, right?
1934869 1936136 Ah!
1953086 1954288 Argh!
1978813 1980949 Argh!
1981048 1982449 It's incredible.
1984451 1987387 I guess this means<br />I'm not in the control group?
1987488 1990224 I can't disclose<br />that information, officially.
1990324 1993026 This could be something<br />called the placebo effect.
1993126 1994495 I have to admit,
1994596 1996497 I'm... I'm starting<br />to feel a little...
1997899 1999534 frightened, and, uh...
2000869 2002002 Is this safe?
2002102 2007374 I mean, uh, my face is<br />falling off in clumps.
2007474 2008843 I'm sure it only looks
2008943 2011513 -like clumps to you.<br />-Big gobs.
2011613 2014214 Skin particles cleaving<br />at the fascial planes.
2014314 2016216 Look, you are healing,<br />Mr. Lemuel.
2016316 2018853 You're a part<br />of medical history.
2018953 2021823 You might even be the subject<br />of a documentary one day.
2021923 2023423 If I'm not<br />in the control group.
2023525 2024626 Oh, and if at all possible,
2024726 2026493 I'd like you to take<br />photographs of your face,
2026594 2027829 say ten a day,
2027929 2028997 just to monitor<br />the rate of change,
2029096 2031799 which appears<br />to be very rapid.
2033333 2036538 Perhaps the risk<br />is worth the reward.
2036638 2037739 Something to think about.
2046480 2047481 Ta-da!
2054923 2056524 What do I do with it?
2056624 2060327 Keep it, uh,<br />as a souvenir, a reminder.
2060929 2062162 Of what?
2078378 2081649 Do you hear that? That alarm.
2082850 2084084 You're an actor, right?
2084184 2085520 A movie actor.
2086186 2087956 I've seen you around.
2088056 2090223 You gotta be careful<br />out there, man.
2125660 2127862 Crapper's<br />for customers only, buddy.
2129296 2130598 So what's it gonna be?
2134102 2136203 Something potent<br />by the looks of it.
2144979 2146547 Up? Or rocks?
2150752 2153821 Let's not dilute<br />its medicinal value, huh?
2169037 2170237 Hey, man.
2171271 2172840 I know you.
2175208 2176711 Where do I know you from?
2177277 2178445 I don't know.
2179514 2181516 Do you know me?<br />You recognize me?
2182116 2183250 I'm Guy Gaunt.
2183350 2184585 - I don't know.<br />- Ring a bell?
2184686 2186621 I don't know, maybe.<br />I can't place you.
2186721 2187689 Right.
2189057 2190858 -Volunteer fireman.<br />-What?
2192093 2194394 Do you... Do you work<br />for Facebook?
2194494 2197899 No, but I get this a lot.
2197999 2200200 -Um...<br />-No, that's not it.
2200668 2202637 I saw you.
2202737 2204806 I wouldn't forget you.<br />I... I don't forget a face.
2204906 2205907 Hmm.
2208109 2209610 Excuse me,<br />you got a little, uh,
2210243 2212412 blood or something on ya.
2212513 2215817 - Hmm. Hmm.<br />- What's your name?
2217217 2219286 -Edward.<br />-After that.
2222123 2223558 -Lemuel.<br />-Huh?
2224458 2226194 -Lemuel.<br />-Leemwell.
2226293 2228361 -Edward Leemwell.<br />-Mmm-hmm.
2228462 2229731 Hey, how do you do?
2229831 2232133 This is really<br />some mystery, isn't it?
2232667 2234535 I'm Guy Gaunt, like I said.
2236470 2237872 It'll come to me though.
2238840 2241441 -You think on it, too, okay?<br />-Okay.
2241542 2245345 Okay. Enjoy your drink.
2268335 2270505 No!
2302203 2304404 Uh...
2393160 2395329 I must say<br />it's a silver lining.
2395428 2397198 - It's not...<br />- It's not what?
2401869 2403104 <i>If you put your lips together,</i>
2403204 2406173 <i>and blow, uh, sometimes</i><br /><i>this is what you get.</i>
2407842 2410511 <i>And, uh, you know, most of</i><br /><i>the frustrated comments</i>
2410611 2414181 <i>I get are, "Cosmo, I put</i><br /><i>my lips together and I blew,</i>
2414282 2416017 <i>"but, um, that's all I got.</i>
2416117 2418753 <i>"I sound like a tea kettle,</i><br /><i>but it's not whistling."</i>
2418853 2421722 <i>Obviously, there's</i><br /><i>something else at play.</i>
2422723 2426027 <i>What you really want is</i><br /><i>you want your... your mouth...</i>
2426127 2428963 <i>...tight.</i>
2429063 2431966 <i>Not necessarily...</i>
2432066 2434735 <i>...small,</i><br /><i>because that, you know, varies</i>
2434835 2436504 <i>with the pitch.</i>
2572339 2573340 Whiskey.
2575643 2576777 Rocks, up?
2579747 2581916 I don't wanna dilute<br />the medicinal value.
2583117 2584151 You what?
2596664 2597898 One more?
2608409 2609810 Let's go, man!
2609910 2611580 Come on, man. We did it!
2611679 2614081 -Fucking wild, man.<br />-Let's go baby.
2614181 2616551 Yeah! Yeah!
2616650 2617785 - Come on, man.<br />- Yeah!
2617885 2619521 It's time to fuck up!
2619620 2621122 - Yeah!<br />- Yeah!
2736671 2737871 Uh...
2768269 2769370 You got the hole?
2770639 2773541 Uh, what...<br />What time is it?
2776511 2777712 What the hell did you do?
2777811 2779748 I... I didn't...<br />I didn't do anything.
2779847 2781616 Well, you shouldn't<br />have let it get like this.
2781716 2782916 Yeah. Well, what was<br />I supposed to?
2783017 2784051 I didn't...<br />I didn't know what...
2784151 2786954 You know, I told<br />the guy downstairs, and...
2787054 2789557 -Where were you?<br />-Gallstones.
2789658 2791025 -I thought your mother...<br />-This 4F?
2792092 2793093 Yeah.
2795229 2796531 You're the man<br />that lives here?
2797398 2799833 Well, yes.
2801502 2803571 There's another man<br />that lives here though.
2803672 2806974 Sometimes, maybe. Why?
2807074 2808042 You're the one that called
2808142 2809877 and complained<br />about this hole.
2809977 2811812 -The man with the dog.<br />-No.
2812813 2814448 I mean, I have a cat.
2815482 2818018 A cat? Named what?
2820622 2821922 I don't know.
2826293 2827529 That's the guy<br />that lives here?
2827629 2830464 That is art.
2830565 2833367 - Hmm, like a mask?<br />- Like a... A bust.
2837938 2839273 Pretty weird stuff.
2841041 2843712 Okay, I'll, uh,<br />I'll fix the...
2843812 2845245 -Is that the cat?<br />-Yep.
2847081 2849818 Okay, I'll fix the hole.
2849917 2852219 -Should I leave?<br />-You can do whatever you want.
2852319 2855022 You need help?<br />Want some tap water?
2857191 2859059 I hope I have<br />the materials for this.
2860427 2861596 This is a big problem.
2863297 2864998 Should've fixed this sooner.
2870070 2872239 Hi, uh, sorry.<br />It... It was open.
2872339 2874274 Is this Ed Lemuel's apartment?
2875643 2877044 I... I know it's early.
2877144 2878713 I'm looking for Mr. Lemuel.
2878813 2880147 -Uh, he's a patient of mine.<br />-Um...
2880247 2882883 Uh, we have not heard<br />from him for a week,
2882983 2884051 and no one<br />in my office has been
2884151 2885953 able to get a hold of him.
2886053 2887187 Yeah.
2887287 2891626 Well, what, um,<br />happened is that he, uh...
2892960 2894161 Edward is dead.
2895362 2897197 What? He's dead?
2897297 2899433 It happened very suddenly.
2899534 2900934 How? When... Uh...
2901034 2902637 Excuse me. Excuse me.
2902737 2904271 Ah, thanks. Thanks.
2905205 2908008 I'm Guy, a family friend.
2908643 2909977 -Family.<br />-Yeah.
2910911 2912079 So, is there a funeral?
2912179 2913848 Uh, yeah, no, it's over.
2913947 2917184 He's... He's dead<br />and buried. Cremated.
2917552 2919521 Well, was he sick?
2919621 2921955 Oh, I'm sorry.<br />Excuse me, guys. Yeah.
2922524 2923658 We don't know.
2923758 2925527 We're trying to find out.
2925993 2927327 Suicide.
2928328 2929798 Suicide?
2929898 2931165 Uh, was he depressed?
2931265 2932332 Yeah. I'm sorry.<br />I'm sorry. Yeah.
2932433 2934301 -Was he depressed?<br />-I don't know.
2934401 2936704 I don't know.
2938238 2940007 You... You say<br />he was cremated?
2940107 2941942 I think cremated, yeah.
2943343 2944378 Uh...
2946246 2950718 So you're sure<br />Mr. Lemuel is really gone?
2950819 2954087 Yep. He's, uh,<br />really, really gone.
2954955 2956190 Just like that.
2972172 2973575 I think<br />you have mice.
2974642 2977244 I saw some droppings. Ugh!
2978412 2982015 You need a cat.
2984284 2986420 All right, I'll see you later.

3036938 3039406 - Sorry.<br />- What?
3039507 3041643 Just that<br />little pockmark or whatever.
3041743 3043143 It's nothing.<br />Nobody's ever gonna notice it.

3058258 3059359 You kill somebody?<br />Who are you?
3059459 3061295 I'm not gonna tell anybody.<br />You kill somebody?
3061395 3064398 - No.<br />- Stay humble, Fabio.
3064498 3066768 I see you over there<br />getting a big old head.
3167635 3171039 They taunt me and beg me
3171139 3172707 just to see my face.
3173206 3175910 Only so that when I do,
3176010 3178646 they can turn<br />and run in horror.
3178746 3180380 Thank you,<br />Mr. Silverheels.
3180480 3181783 Thank you for your time.
3186453 3187689 I worry about it.
3189857 3190825 Can I help you?
3192994 3194294 Hi...
3194394 3196531 - Are you here for Edward?<br />- Uh...
3198298 3199399 Is he on the call sheet?
3199499 3201368 Sammy Silverheels<br />is the last one for the day.
3202670 3204772 -What?<br />-Did you get sides?
3206107 3208009 -Sides?<br />-Viv give him the...
3208109 3209877 Get him sides for, um, Theo.
3209977 3211079 - Okay.<br />- Scene 12.
3211179 3212914 - Fiona, can you...<br />- Yeah.
3222289 3224291 Okay. Whenever you're ready.
3231799 3232800 Um...
3234267 3235703 "If... If it was me,<br />I would...

3246279 3247682 "if he's gonna be there.
3250051 3254555 "Always be on guard.<br />Jesus, I'd have nightmares."
3254655 3257825 Come on. Don't be an asshole.<br />You don't mean that.
3263664 3265767 "I sure as hell do mean it.
3265867 3270337 "And I... I don't feel bad<br />about it either.

3303070 3305239 I need this, man.
3305338 3307508 I'd be right for it, too.
3307608 3309911 Kind of born for it.
3310611 3312246 You know what I mean.
3312345 3314549 Just wanna tell my mama,
3314649 3317952 "Hey, it was all worth it."
3319720 3322790 The life<br />we've chosen, huh?
3325126 3326093 Yeah.
3348348 3350483 Uh, who is Guy Moratz?
3350585 3352153 Does it hurt?
3352253 3354055 - No.<br />- Good.
3355823 3357158 Hey, that photo,
3357258 3358626 - is that you as a boy?<br />- Oh.
3358726 3359727 - Excuse me.<br />- Yeah.
3359827 3361996 Excuse me.<br />What's going on here?
3363764 3365800 - I...<br />- Well...
3365900 3366934 What?
3367034 3370938 Forgive me, is that,<br />uh, some kind of mask?
3372206 3373473 It's a prototype.
3374242 3377044 Prototype? Of what?
3377144 3378378 For the face.
3378478 3381315 The eventual, uh...
3382183 3383985 Uh, we'll use makeup.<br />I don't... I don't know...
3384085 3385152 However you wanna handle it.
3386053 3387588 Who are you exactly?
3387688 3388890 I'm Edward.
3390358 3391893 Guy Moratz, supposedly.
3393227 3394427 - I was...<br />- Guy Moratz.
3394528 3396496 - You're Guy Moratz.<br />- I was born for this.
3397865 3398966 So...
3400001 3401335 I am this guy.
3401434 3403571 Are you... deformed?
3404672 3406040 I am this guy.
3408142 3409476 We...
3409577 3411879 This is... This is an<br />off-Broadway production.
3411979 3413314 I don't think<br />we can afford makeup.
3413413 3414749 Just let me<br />do the scene.
3415616 3416951 Where'd<br />you get that mask?
3417051 3418152 Begin please.
3419520 3421656 Begin. Come on.
3424258 3425626 There.
3426861 3428329 All better.
3428428 3430064 - Does it hurt?<br />- No.
3431165 3432166 Good.
3434101 3435102 Hey...
3435536 3436938 That photo.
3437038 3439941 - Oh.<br />- Is that you as a boy?
3440041 3442677 Uh, um, yeah.
3443911 3446479 So I guess you weren't born...
3449583 3452887 - I'm sorry. It's not my place.<br />- It's okay.
3454255 3457158 People probably<br />ask you a lot of questions.
3458826 3462096 It's not the questions<br />I, uh, mind so much.
3463864 3464832 No?
3465866 3468002 People can be cruel,<br />I imagine.
3471439 3472907 You have an eyelash.
3473007 3474809 - Let me get it.<br />- Uh...
3481315 3482482 - I...<br />- Oh.
3483050 3485019 I have to go. I...
3485119 3486486 - I'm... I'm sorry.<br />- No, no, no.
3486587 3488189 I... I didn't realize<br />what time it was.
3488289 3490591 I'm sorry.<br />It's just, um...
3492226 3493493 No one, uh...
3496230 3497631 No one's ever, uh...
3499967 3503170 Touched my...<br />My face before.
3516717 3519286 Your first audition<br />was a little, uh...
3519387 3521288 I was,<br />uh, traumatized,
3521389 3523190 because a... a friend,
3523290 3526327 childhood best friend was...
3526427 3529196 Had very much,<br />uh, this condition.
3529296 3530798 Like Edward, your Edward.
3530898 3532566 Don't tell me<br />his name was Edward.
3533300 3534301 No, no.
3535136 3538039 -Ronnie.<br />-Can Lonnie act?
3538139 3540307 He died. Um, which is...
3540408 3543177 And so I...<br />I felt overwhelmed.
3543277 3544311 Uh, you know,
3544412 3547848 and... And... And that's why<br />I really feel strongly
3547948 3550584 that I have to play this part.
3550684 3553454 That's one way<br />to honor a friend.
3553554 3554588 Check it out.
3554688 3556490 So did you know<br />an Edward?
3556590 3559360 An Edward?<br />This can't just be a story
3559460 3561062 my brilliant imagination has<br />cooked up?
3561162 3564065 I've known, you know,<br />a couple of people.
3564165 3567368 It's more of, um...<br />What's the word?
3567468 3569370 -Tribute.<br />-Amalgamation.
3569837 3571672 -Oh.<br />-It's me, too.
3571772 3574509 Part of the character is<br />based on myself in a way.
3574608 3575676 It's... It's, um...
3575776 3577711 Uh, how... How... How is that?
3577812 3579847 To be perfectly blunt,<br />I'd wanted to cast
3579947 3581682 a person who looks, well,
3581782 3584885 -who looks like that, ideally.<br />-Hmm.
3584985 3587254 But it's... It's hard.<br />You get fixated on this idea,
3587354 3589890 and, um, if it's not right,<br />it's not right.
3589990 3591926 You had someone<br />specific in mind.
3592026 3593761 The question is,<br />do you cast someone
3593861 3596730 with a condition even though<br />it's not the right fit?
3596831 3598432 Is it wrong to cast someone
3598533 3600201 because of their disfigurement?
3601469 3602937 Exploitative even?
3604205 3605673 Will people come to gawk?
3605773 3606907 Where's the ethical line?
3607007 3609110 You know, it's funny<br />because, um,
3609210 3612746 Edward has this awkwardness<br />in his own skin,
3612847 3614782 and it's kind of brilliant<br />in a way,
3614882 3617118 seeing you who looks like you,
3618252 3619120 but you're not yourself.
3619220 3620988 You have this mask,<br />this other persona,
3621088 3622957 and it creates<br />this dissonance,
3623057 3625726 and it just...<br />It clicked for me.
3625826 3627695 It was strangely affecting.
3629296 3632766 It was like seeing<br />my own creation come to life.
3646046 3648015 -Oh, hey, Mr. Sablosky.<br />-Hey.
3658259 3661061 He's blind.<br />Shoes off please.
3665833 3667034 -Not the bag.<br />-What?
3667134 3669103 Just kidding.
3671972 3673407 Just put it on the floor.
3682183 3685853 Is this where you,<br />uh, you do your writing?
3685953 3688689 Oh, I never used it.<br />I'm not sure it even works.
3697198 3700334 - Seems to work.<br />- Hmm. It's yours.
3700434 3701769 Give it a proper home.
3704104 3706440 What...<br />Where did it come from?
3707775 3708876 Looks Italian.
3710545 3711613 Psst, psst, psst, psst.
3711712 3713881 Hello.
3713981 3716317 -Hello.<br />-Who... Who is this?
3716417 3718886 -C. Pulaski.<br />-C. Pulaski.
3718986 3720354 - C. Pulaski.<br />- Yeah.
3720454 3721255 -Hey.<br />-Oh.
3725159 3726160 You hungry?
3727094 3729263 Goddamn her.
3730464 3731832 -Ugh!<br />-Who... Who is that?
3731932 3735269 It's this intolerable<br />old hag down there.
3735369 3737071 You can't even walk<br />barefoot in here.
3738172 3739273 Okay.
3739373 3741875 -There's the bar.<br />-Oh, I've had enough.
3742510 3743811 Make me something.
3746981 3748249 Ooh.
3748349 3750150 Ooh.
3769503 3771372 How long have you lived here?
3776277 3777244 Hmm.
3781815 3783117 I don't think<br />the old hag's gonna...
3783217 3784985 ...like that.
3791358 3793894 Well, what's worse?
3793994 3796230 Me having to tiptoe<br />around not to upset
3796330 3799300 the sensitive bitch,<br />or her having to live
3799400 3801502 with such a noisy<br />little bitch upstairs?
3803804 3806340 I would rather live<br />in a house all by myself.
3807509 3808809 That's not an answer.
3814448 3816551 -Cops after you?<br />-What?
3816651 3818986 -You're jumpy.<br />-I startle easily.
3819086 3820487 Yeah. Nervous Nelly.
3820588 3822089 You think it's the bitch?
3826528 3827494 - Hey.<br />- I'm sorry.
3827595 3829597 I was just in the borough.<br />I thought I'd drop in.
3829698 3831599 You don't live here.<br />What are you doing here?
3831700 3833834 I can see you're<br />as excited to see me
3833934 3835102 - as I am to see you.<br />- Yes, Carl.
3836470 3839006 It's not a game.<br />It's... It's over.
3839106 3841842 I'm sorry, Carl.<br />I have someone here.
3841942 3843511 Yeah, right here.
3843611 3845780 I'm here<br />to come in, say hello.
3845879 3848148 I have<br />a visitor. Okay?
3848248 3849383 What...<br />What does that mean?
3849483 3850652 A... A delivery person?
3850752 3852252 No.<br />You know what that means.
3852353 3853287 Don't act stupid.
3853387 3855956 - You know what I mean.<br />- Okay.
3885052 3886521 Bah!
3886621 3889890 I had to do that.
3890658 3892126 Who was... Who was that?
3892627 3893661 Jilted lover.
3895129 3897898 - Hmm.<br />- So many jilted lovers.
3903103 3905640 I leave a trail<br />of tragedy in my wake.
3911613 3912980 I warned you.
3917384 3921856 The sad reality is<br />my face is fragile.
3921955 3923223 And it's imperative
3923323 3927529 that I conduct my life<br />based upon this fact.
3929062 3931965 When in doubt, live in fear.
3932767 3934536 That's my mantra.
3934636 3938405 Stay out of ballrooms,<br />or crowded places in general.
3938506 3940642 Be nice to people.<br />Be deferential.
3940742 3942042 Be the bigger man.
3942142 3945713 Argue if I must,<br />and I mustn't really,
3945814 3947948 only from a safe distance.
3948048 3952754 Or under the protection<br />of some powerful friend,
3952854 3954689 if I even had one<br />and if he could
3954789 3957191 then be relied upon.
3958827 3960494 I tell myself,
3960595 3965065 "Edward, don't call<br />attention to yourself."
3966133 3968570 It's a useless ad... Ad...
3969236 3973040 It's a useless advice.
3974876 3976043 Eh...
3977712 3979346 Oh, pardon the, uh, intrusion.
3979446 3982684 I met this casting director,<br />unique and unusual
3982784 3985185 physiognomies is<br />his specialty.
3985285 3987054 And he told me about<br />this interesting play,
3987154 3988355 you're auditioning for,
3988455 3990357 and thought I could<br />potentially be a perfect fit.
3990457 3991793 So I'm no actor,<br />but I thought,
3991893 3993928 let's come down here,<br />give it a gander.
3994027 3996230 And from the tidbit<br />I've just seen,
3996330 3998165 seems like<br />a rather curious piece.
3998265 4000200 But alas,<br />I see the role is filled,
4000300 4002135 and rather ably, I must say.
4002236 4004137 So congrats to all involved.
4004238 4006941 And best of luck.<br />Break a leg, as they say.
4007040 4009009 I'll be sure to see it<br />when it comes out.
4009109 4010310 Take care.
4032934 4034167 Wait. Wait, wait.
4034268 4035703 -What?<br />-Wait. Hold on.
4038640 4039641 You have the mask?
4040508 4041475 What?
4042777 4043811 Put it on.
4044979 4048081 -Why?<br />-Just do what I tell you.
4049918 4051184 You don't wanna look at me?
4052754 4054689 Come on. It's my creation.
4078780 4079781 Hmm.
4148716 4150183 No, stop.
4152152 4153186 What's the problem?
4153286 4155857 This is so fucked up.
4156691 4157859 What do you mean?
4157959 4160528 You look ridiculous.
4162697 4164999 I just wanna say a toast<br />to the man who sold
4165099 4167401 the Cortland property,<br />finally.
4167501 4168670 - King of 'em all.<br />- Ah.
4168770 4170538 Shit hole<br />with half a bathroom.
4170638 4172272 Chin-chin, my little man.
4172372 4174542 - Chin-chin, indeed.<br />- Edward.
4175543 4176577 Hey, you probably don't<br />remember me.
4176678 4178079 We met back at the, um...
4178178 4179714 ...theatre. Oswald.
4179814 4180882 - I...<br />- Edward?
4180982 4182215 - I'm sorry. Edward?<br />- Um, hi.
4182315 4184184 - Sorry, what? Edward?<br />- It's... It's nothing.
4184284 4186219 Ooh, you're<br />only Edward on the telly.
4186319 4187555 Sorry, awful joke.
4187655 4189957 What do you go by<br />in the civilian world?
4190058 4191224 - Guy.<br />- Guy Moratz.
4191324 4192459 Fabio is<br />what I call him.
4192560 4194162 Do you wanna<br />pull up a seat, Oswald?
4194261 4195295 I've got<br />a few moments, sure.
4195395 4197765 This is all very,<br />very mysterious.
4197865 4201169 What secret intel have you got<br />about our enigmatic friend?
4201268 4203503 Only that<br />your dear friend, Mr. Moratz,
4203604 4206941 is starring in a soon-to-be,<br />classic theatrical production.
4207041 4208375 Star? Like as an actor?
4208475 4211378 No, it's... It's...<br />It's a small, uh, production.
4211478 4213081 -Uh, play. Um...<br />-Uh-huh. Okay.
4213181 4214649 Well, thank you so much<br />for telling me.
4214749 4215950 It makes me feel<br />very close to you.
4216050 4217752 -It's hard to, um, it, it's...<br />-Your friend plays a man
4217852 4220353 with a disfigured face.<br />Name of Edward.
4220454 4221488 Disfigured face?
4221589 4223691 And he dons<br />a very convincing mask.
4223791 4225258 Well, it's still being<br />perfected.
4225358 4226460 It's a prototype.
4226561 4227427 It's a sort of<br /><i>a Beauty and the Beast</i> yarn.
4227528 4228563 That's one way<br />of looking at it.
4228663 4229897 I love<br /><i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>
4229997 4231666 -No. Well, it's called...<br />-It's called just <i>Edward,</i>
4231766 4235469 which presumably means that<br />you are the star of the show.
4235570 4237505 Our Guy,<br />a Broadway star?
4237605 4239207 -Off-Broadway.<br />-Off-Broadway, Broadway.
4239306 4240508 His first step<br />on the road to glory.
4240608 4241676 - Show business.<br />- I saw
4241776 4243376 a little bit of it,<br />and I was gobsmacked.
4243477 4244912 You were leading<br />a double life, and I knew it.
4245012 4246681 He's cheating on us,<br />that's what he's doing.
4246781 4248315 I... I'm getting the feeling<br />I've messed things
4248415 4249784 up for you tonight.
4249884 4251384 Yeah, you've outed him.<br />Look how embarrassed he is.
4251485 4252553 - I'm not...<br />- Little bashful, you are...
4252653 4253654 He's<br />always embarrassed.
4253755 4255422 He's this little, like,<br />Nervous Nelly,
4255523 4256691 - I always call him, you know?<br />- Well, you should
4256791 4257959 see him when he gets bashful<br />like the seven dwarfs.
4258059 4259127 Would you like<br />a drink, Oswald?
4259227 4260595 I...<br />Actually, I have to skedaddle.
4260695 4262429 But it was lovely meeting<br />all of you. And a thousand...
4262530 4263998 And a thousand apologies
4264098 4266167 if I caused<br />any discomfiture at all.
4266266 4267535 - It wasn't my place to...<br />- No, no, no.
4267635 4268770 ...to reveal your secret.
4268870 4270605 - Oh, it's...<br />- I will hopefully meet
4270705 4272573 all of you again,<br />and I will see you,
4272673 4275676 my friend, on stage,<br />cheering from the front row.
4275777 4276944 Take care.<br />Lovely meeting you all.
4277044 4278246 Bye, bye, Oswald.
4278345 4281381 I'm mortified<br />by my recklessness,
4281481 4283151 and I hope this doesn't<br />come between us.
4283251 4284786 I just wanted<br />to make sure you knew
4284886 4286754 how much I enjoyed<br />your performance.
4286854 4288523 - Take care, Guy.<br />- When is it?
4288623 4289924 - I mean, can we come?<br />- Does it have
4290024 4291125 your little pock mark...
4291225 4292392 I like<br />that guy's accent.
4292492 4293895 - Is he from around here?<br />- So, Edward...
4293995 4295763 - Don't call me that.<br />- Edward.
4295863 4298099 It's a cute name<br />on you, first of all.
4298199 4300134 I just don't understand.<br />He talks...
4300234 4301536 He speaks<br />to the audience in...
4301636 4303971 In these long<br />philosophical monologues,
4304071 4305405 and then when he talks<br />to Fiona,
4305506 4308441 -he's monosyllabic.<br />-Yeah. You want more lines?
4308543 4309977 You can barely remember<br />the ones you have.
4310077 4312647 And why does he have<br />to be so grateful to her?
4312747 4314015 - Just because he has this...<br />- He's not grateful!
4314115 4316017 He's so indebted to her<br />just for talking to him?
4316117 4317384 No. He's nervous<br />because he hasn't
4317484 4318686 had a lot of experience.
4318786 4320054 How do you know what kind<br />of experience he's had?
4320154 4321989 -Are you fucking kidding me?<br />-Maybe he's had a rich life.
4322089 4324324 -We don't know his backstory.<br />-I know the backstory
4324424 4325760 of my own character,<br />thank you very much.
4325860 4327161 And then he has<br />to go kill himself,
4327261 4328563 'cause, of course,<br />he's so depressed
4328663 4330932 -because he's deformed.<br />-Look who I ran into.
4331498 4334434 Guy, my fellow!
4334535 4336037 Ah, it's good<br />to see you again.
4336137 4337238 Do you know<br />each other?
4337337 4339273 Uh, yeah. I drunkenly<br />descended upon Guy,
4339372 4340975 and his real estate mates<br />at the pub.
4341075 4342610 - Real estate mates?<br />- Lovely bunch.
4342710 4345046 I forgot to say, I'm looking<br />for a place of my own.
4345146 4346047 Oh, sorry. Oswald.
4346147 4348583 - I'm Ingrid.<br />- Ah, the marvelous scribe.
4348683 4350483 - And director.<br />- Ah, <i>la maestra.</i>
4350585 4353154 Um, and this is Fiona,<br />who plays Iris.
4353254 4354188 - Hey.<br />- Good to meet you.
4354288 4355256 Uh, and yeah, you met Vivian.
4355355 4356456 - Of course.<br />- Yeah.
4356557 4360061 Uh, I don't know if this<br />is okay with you, I...
4360161 4361361 Would you like<br />to stay and watch?
4361461 4362697 Oh, I'm...<br />I'm developing
4362797 4364599 somewhat of a reputation<br />of intruding
4364699 4365867 where I'm not wanted.
4365967 4368135 No, not at all, really.
4368236 4369402 It will be<br />nerve-wracking for us.
4369502 4370571 The play's still very nascent.
4370671 4372073 Nothing is set in stone.
4372173 4374407 Oh, everyone's so<br />self-conscious in showbiz.
4374508 4375743 - I love it.<br />- Yes.
4375843 4377211 Though I am intrigued<br />by this whole process,
4377311 4378346 I have to admit.
4378445 4380214 Um, well,<br />if you're not too busy.
4380314 4382283 No. I mean, I've just<br />had Jiu-Jitsu practice,
4382382 4383551 -so I'm a bit sweaty.<br />-Oh, wow.
4383651 4385019 But other than that,<br />I was just gonna sit
4385119 4386053 in the park and read my book.
4386153 4388189 - What are you reading?<br /><i>- The Bluest Eye,</i>
4388289 4389523 -by Toni Morrison.<br />-That's one
4389624 4390925 - of my favorite books!<br />- Really? Oh, no way.
4391025 4393527 It just so happens I was<br />inspired by Guy to pick it up.
4393628 4395563 He's got these<br />piercing blue eyes.
4395663 4396631 And when I first saw them,
4396731 4398766 I was like,<br />"Ah, that reminds me."
4398866 4400433 Really? I never noticed<br />your eyes, Guy.
4400534 4402336 - Okay. Sit anywhere you want.<br />- Cool.
4402435 4404639 It will be boring,<br />stopping and starting.
4404739 4405940 You won't<br />know I'm here.
4406040 4407041 -Yeah, scene 16.<br />-Sixteen.
4407141 4410410 Yeah, just from the top.<br />Okay, and then, it's, uh...
4410878 4412113 Okay.
4419553 4421656 I was sad when he<br />offed himself in the end.
4421756 4422957 Yeah, well,<br />it's a tragedy.
4423057 4424091 I mean, I know<br />There's... There's nothing
4424191 4425293 can really be done about it.
4425393 4426928 And I really like Edward.
4427028 4427795 A rather passive chap.
4427895 4429764 Well, of course,<br />till the suicide.
4429864 4431699 But honestly,<br />I was really hoping
4431799 4434501 Edward, and, uh, Fiona,<br />would live happily ever after.
4434602 4435603 -Oh, yeah.<br />-But then,
4435703 4436671 would the audience<br />believe that?
4436771 4438471 I love your accent.
4438572 4439707 I get that a lot.
4439807 4441842 You yanks love my mellifluous<br />lyrical stylings.
4441943 4443811 But back at home,
4443911 4444712 I'm just a bloke.
4444812 4447114 No one pays any attention<br />to me at all.
4447214 4447982 Oh, my God.
4448082 4449784 We should have<br />Edward have an accent.
4449884 4451185 I reckon the critics<br />would find it
4451285 4452420 a really classy endeavor.
4452520 4453854 -That's a great idea.<br />-Do it.
4453955 4456257 -Guy speak like Oswald.<br />-I... I can't. I can't.
4456357 4458059 -Sure you can.<br />-Come on. 'Ello mate.
4458159 4458960 'Ello mate.
4459060 4459994 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah, yeah, look.
4460094 4461494 How's... How's<br />the old lady doin'?
4461595 4462563 Uh, how's the old lady doing?
4462663 4463698 - That's horrible.<br />- I mean...
4463798 4464966 It needs<br />some refinement,
4465066 4465967 but we'll get you there.
4466067 4467435 You do<br />an American accent.
4467535 4468569 I coulda been a contender.
4468669 4470371 - Yeah!<br />- Adrienne!
4470470 4471973 -Yes!<br />-I am not a crook.
4472073 4474942 Wow, that's amazing.<br />Why can't you do that?
4475042 4476277 You're not playing
4476377 4477378 - Master Harold after all.<br />- I guess they didn't
4477477 4478612 teach you accents at Julliard.
4478713 4479981 Really, Guy.<br />I had an affinity
4480081 4482583 for accents as a child,<br />like moving around a lot,
4482683 4484151 and it just, sort of,<br />blossomed into one
4484251 4485553 of my many useless talents.
4485653 4486654 What's your other talents?
4486754 4487922 Ooh, well, I can yodel.
4488022 4488990 Yodel-aye-ee-hoo!
4489090 4490758 I can juggle. I can sing.
4490858 4492760 I can play sax,<br />though I'm no Coltrane.
4492860 4494095 And I'm learning to weave.
4494195 4496030 -I'm ashamed to say.<br />-Oh, what can't you do?
4496130 4498332 -I mean, I can't whistle.<br />-I can teach you.
4498432 4499967 You just...
4500067 4502069 Put your lips<br />together and blow!
4504071 4506307 Oh, I can't drive<br />that well either.
4506407 4507641 Can you act?
4517351 4518619 What time is it?
4519620 4520955 He's right.
4521389 4522790 Edward is too passive.
4527728 4530564 What does he know<br />about Edward?
4531599 4533267 I made him a victim.
4534802 4536937 I fell into<br />the most obvious trap.
4538472 4540908 What is he supposed<br />to be? A hero?
4542176 4543778 An inspiration?
4543878 4547715 He's...<br />He's just Edward.
4549216 4550684 Look, you said it yourself.
4550785 4552053 You wanted more lines.
4552953 4554789 And then you got mad at me.
4554889 4556957 -But if Oswald says it then...<br />-Come on.
4558125 4559593 The guy<br />who killed Lincoln.
4559693 4562296 - What?<br />- Oswald.
4564899 4566267 Oswald killed Kennedy.
4567536 4571372 Whatever. Lincoln, right?
4572073 4574041 A disgruntled actor<br />killed Lincoln,
4574141 4575843 right there<br />in the theater, right?
4576577 4577812 Hinkley.
4578646 4579847 Booth.
4581415 4582616 Right there in the booth.
4591125 4591992 I'm sorry.
4592093 4595096 This must feel<br />very dehumanizing.
4598567 4601268 Uh-oh. It's very fragile.
4605039 4606841 No! Leave me alone!<br />Don't touch me!
4606941 4608142 But I was only trying to...
4608242 4611445 Yes! You're always trying<br />to be helpful, aren't you?
4611546 4612847 Yes! Uh...
4612947 4615550 Uh, I...<br />I don't want your pity!
4615649 4617318 You, you... I...<br />I know you dis...
4617418 4619120 I disgust you!
4619220 4620855 - That isn't true.<br />- You don't think I know
4620955 4622890 what all your...<br />All your little friends
4622990 4624258 say about me?
4624358 4626460 "Why are you hanging out<br />with that, with that freak?
4626561 4627828 "He's gonna get<br />the wrong idea."
4627928 4630197 Well, you're<br />the worst out of all them!
4630297 4633701 Ah! Ah... I don't...<br />I don't care about your caring
4633801 4635803 and kindness and fussing!
4637171 4639073 Fuck.
4641208 4642176 I hate you.
4651018 4652119 Sir Guy.
4653287 4655624 What are you...<br />What are you doing here?
4655723 4657124 Yoga in the park.
4658425 4659426 Do you do yoga?
4660562 4662597 -No.<br />-Oh, you should try it.
4662696 4664098 It's really therapeutic.
4664965 4666700 -Yeah.<br />-I mean, off the record,
4666800 4667935 it's a bit of a chore,
4668035 4670004 but they say it's good<br />for your withering body.
4670104 4671739 I think I'm feeling<br />the benefits,
4671839 4673440 but maybe it's a placebo.
4673542 4674742 I don't know.
4675544 4677011 Oh, would you look at that.
4698165 4701435 <i>♪ I floated lonely down</i><br /><i>the street one day... ♪</i>
4701536 4702604 Oh, I almost forgot.
4702703 4704606 They did<br />the mock-up today. Right?
4705973 4708242 Latex isn't it? How'd it go?
4708342 4709544 You heard about that?
4709644 4711779 Yeah, Ingrid was<br />quite stressy about it.
4711879 4713847 -Did it come off?<br />-What?
4713948 4715684 Did it have<br />the desired effect?
4715783 4718352 -Well, it's still a...<br />-Work in progress. Right?
4718452 4721088 Gonna take a bit of refinement<br />to get it spot on.
4721188 4723924 That's what Murray said,<br />the makeup artist.
4724024 4726561 Did you know<br />he's half Northern Irish?
4726661 4727895 He said that's<br />the most complicated thing
4727995 4729531 he's ever worked on.
4729631 4731666 I can't wait<br />to see it in action.
4731765 4733568 Part of me wants to<br />wait till opening night
4733668 4736103 so I get hit<br />by the full effect of it,
4736203 4738272 but I still think<br />I'll swing by tomorrow.
4738372 4740241 Ingrid wants some<br />feedback on the new pages,
4740341 4742209 and it's always nice<br />to see the gang.
4744646 4745680 You don't work?
4745779 4747248 Frankly, I don't work.
4747348 4750050 I made some lucky investments<br />when I was at university
4750150 4752820 before running off<br />to Tangiers with my professor.
4752920 4755089 Right now I'm looking<br />for a place in the city,
4755189 4756625 which is why I thought<br />I'd sit down
4756725 4757858 and have a chat with you.
4757958 4759260 - So...<br />- Look who it is.
4759360 4761061 Can I believe my eyes?
4761161 4763097 Oswald, you owe me dinner.
4763598 4764566 I'm so ashamed.
4764666 4767368 Hi. I'm Sadie.
4767468 4768269 - Hey.<br />- Hmm.
4768369 4771138 Oh, this is Guy.<br />He's a masterful actor.
4771238 4774743 Oh, no. I have<br />bad luck with actors.
4774842 4777144 We are working<br />on a play together.
4777612 4778747 You never stop, do you?
4778846 4781815 Oswald is<br />one of my favorite people
4781915 4783250 in the world.
4783350 4785720 How about I call you,<br />say next week?
4785819 4789189 I'll believe it<br />when I see it.
4797031 4798600 Nice to meet you, Guy.
4798700 4799900 Watch out for this one.
4803003 4805839 -Who was that?<br />-I mean, I know how it looks.
4805939 4807742 Just don't get any ideas.

4926661 4928028 I'm not Edward anymore?
4928128 4931733 Oh, no, you are,<br />just after his transformation.
4931833 4933066 What is he talking about?
4933167 4934736 Well,<br />I've been thinking,
4934836 4936370 and to your credit, Guy,
4936470 4938673 you were right,<br />and Oswald, too.
4938773 4940842 The suicide was ludicrous.
4940941 4943711 This wasn't meant<br />to be a tragic love story.
4943812 4945312 Why can't they be happy?
4945412 4947047 And then Oswald<br />and I were talking about
4947147 4949082 <i>Beauty and the Beast</i><br />and how he, in the end,
4949183 4951820 -becomes a beautiful prince.<br />-A prince?
4951920 4953588 And you are<br />that prince.
4953688 4954689 And you are the beast?
4954789 4955924 No, no,<br />I'm not the beast.
4956023 4957424 I'm Edward. This isn't<br /><i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>
4957525 4959293 That was just<br />by way of explaining.
4959794 4961195 Okay.
4961295 4963565 I don't understand<br />how he transforms.
4963665 4964998 How, how...
4965098 4967735 -How is this possible?<br />-He doesn't transform.
4967836 4968803 Not literally.
4968903 4970471 She just sees<br />him differently.
4970572 4972139 Why?
4972239 4974975 You know how we idealize<br />people when we're in love?
4975075 4976176 So I'm the idealized version<br />of Oswald?
4976276 4978045 No, no.<br />Not me, of Edward.
4978145 4979514 Why can't it just be him?
4979614 4981248 Why does she have to idealize<br />him so he's somebody he isn't?
4981348 4983150 Well, frankly, Guy,
4983250 4984451 to keep you in the play.
4985252 4986386 Look, this is hard for me,
4986487 4988155 but I really need Oswald<br />to be Edward,
4988255 4989456 and he refused<br />unless there was
4989557 4991391 a part for you,<br />because he loves you
4991492 4993795 and he didn't want it to be<br />like he was replacing you.
4993895 4995195 You should really be<br />thanking Oswald.
4995295 4996631 This is my decision.
4996731 4998999 I had to beg him to do it.<br />Look, it's not you Guy.
4999099 5000935 It's... It's the whole...<br />The mask, the makeup.
5001034 5004104 It's a total bust.<br />And Oswald, I mean...
5005105 5006841 Ingrid insisted.
5006941 5008610 And I have to admit,<br />this does feel like
5008710 5010344 a uniquely rare opportunity
5010444 5013447 for a role that I was<br />arguably born to play.
5013548 5015850 You're selling yourself short.<br />You could play Hamlet.
5015950 5017652 She's such<br />a canny director,
5017752 5018720 flattering me like that.
5018820 5019888 Frankly, Guy,<br />we've been making
5019988 5021388 all these changes<br />and you've been having
5021488 5023156 a hard time,<br />memorizing your new lines.
5023257 5024258 I haven't. I just...
5024358 5025793 -It's a process.<br />-Whereas, Oswald,
5025894 5028228 has photographic memory.
5028328 5030130 I mean, sure I have<br />photographic memory,
5030230 5032065 technically,<br />but will that come in handy
5032165 5034501 -in this situation?<br />-You already know your lines.
5034602 5036169 I know my lines,<br />sure, but can I act?
5036270 5038873 -That is the question.<br />-You can. He can.
5038973 5040575 You've seen it.<br />We've all seen it.
5040675 5041910 Oswald's a natural.
5042010 5043076 If it's right, it's right.
5043176 5044546 You... You know the lines?
5044646 5045847 You, you've seen him act?
5045947 5047180 When... When did<br />all this happen?
5047281 5048282 When he's been giving<br />me feedback.
5048382 5049851 Guy, you're<br />a masterful actor,
5049951 5051318 which is why<br />this is so tragic.
5051418 5053755 I really don't know what<br />the ethical thing to do is.
5053855 5055924 The right thing to do is<br />for you to take the role,
5056024 5058458 and you still get<br />to play Edward, Guy,
5058560 5059359 just transformed.
5059459 5060795 And you don't have<br />to hide your face
5060895 5061996 behind that idiotic thing.
5062095 5063531 You, you get more recognition.
5063631 5065265 -For one scene.<br />-But what a scene.
5065365 5067134 -The finale.<br />-No one's gonna believe
5067234 5068435 that Edward looks like him
5068536 5070404 and then suddenly<br />he just looks like me.
5070504 5071706 - Magic!<br />- But she loves him
5071806 5073373 for who he is. If he changes,<br />then who is he then?
5073473 5075810 - Same person.<br />- Same bloke, new face.
5075910 5076878 That's<br />a different person!
5076978 5077979 It's<br />a metaphorical change.
5078078 5079112 Right out<br />of <i>Beauty and the Beast.</i>
5079212 5080782 She loves him,<br />therefore, <i>voila,</i>
5080882 5082016 he appears<br />more beautiful to her.
5082115 5083585 But he has to pretend<br />to be a beast
5083685 5084552 to prove her love.
5084652 5086054 He doesn't wanna be<br />loved for his looks.
5086153 5087522 No, she loves him<br />because he's a beast.
5087622 5088756 Or in spite<br />of his beastliness.
5088856 5090324 They're talking<br />about you like you're a beast.
5090424 5091693 We're talking about Edward.
5093126 5094161 Edward is not a beast.
5094261 5095495 Oh, no. Heavens, no.
5095597 5098298 But if we are gonna be using<br /><i>Beauty and the Beast</i>
5098398 5100602 as our<br />hypothetical comparison,
5100702 5102770 well, let's just all start<br />being honest
5102870 5104504 with ourselves, old friend.
5110477 5111478 I'll put it<br />on my calendar.
5111579 5113180 - Hey.<br />- Okay, great, yeah.
5113280 5116116 -What?<br />-Let's go home.
5116216 5117217 - Let's have a drink.<br />- Mmm.
5117317 5119386 -Don't be mopey.<br />-I'm not thirsty.
5120387 5121889 Come or go. It's up to you.
5123457 5124424 Come on.
5126126 5127595 Come on. Come for one.
5140074 5142977 At first,<br />the thought terrified me,
5143077 5147715 having my face disseminated<br />to screens across the world,
5147815 5151886 that no matter what the hour,<br />people were seeing me,
5152720 5154287 were laughing at me,
5154388 5156156 were horrified by me.
5156256 5157759 And that even when I'm gone,
5157859 5161495 my image would remain<br />for others to despise.
5161596 5167334 But then, this idea<br />gave me some comfort.
5167434 5171171 That if it wasn't me<br />they were laughing at,
5171271 5173107 if I had not been known,
5173206 5176410 if I had not had<br />to face my tormentors,
5177045 5178913 they'd be laughing<br />at someone else,
5179947 5181248 someone different.
5201936 5203538 Hey, you were<br />in the show, weren't you?
5203638 5206339 I loved it. Congratulations.
5206440 5208676 -Hi. Ron Belcher.<br />-Thanks.
5209977 5212180 That guy's amazing, right?
5212279 5213715 I... I gotta be<br />honest with you,
5214314 5215616 I thought it was makeup.
5215717 5217819 I was saying to my wife...<br />It's actually our anniversary.
5217919 5219620 That's her over there.
5219721 5221789 I was saying to her,<br />"How'd they do that make-up?"
5221889 5224357 "Right? What is that?<br />Some kind of polymer, right?"
5224458 5226259 "Where'd they get<br />the budget for this?"
5226359 5228596 But she says to me,<br />"I think that's his face."
5228696 5231599 And I said,<br />"No, babe, you're nuts.
5231699 5233534 "That's gotta be<br />some sort of get-up."
5233634 5235203 Like the whole time<br />I'm watching the show,
5235302 5236503 I'm sitting there thinking,
5236604 5240340 "Is that real or is it<br />some kind of weird effect?"
5240440 5241642 I mean, I couldn't<br />believe it either way.
5241743 5243778 Man, I didn't know what<br />I even wanted it to be.
5243878 5247481 So what was it like, uh,<br />working with him?
5249449 5250785 I guess underneath<br />all that, right,
5250885 5252220 he's just a regular guy.
5252319 5254254 Wonder if the guy that<br />wrote the play,
5254354 5255790 knew him before he wrote it,
5255890 5257692 or if he just came up<br />with a character like that
5257792 5260128 on his own and just hoped<br />the right guy would
5260228 5261195 come along by chance.
5261328 5262764 Right? Seems risky to me.
5262864 5265499 Right? How do you go about<br />finding that guy, right?
5265600 5267434 Looks exactly<br />how you envision.
5267869 5268736 He can act too, right?
5268836 5270270 I mean, how do you<br />even describe him?
5270370 5272272 What if they wanna put<br />the show on in Boise?
5272372 5275243 Like to fly that guy out?<br />What if he's dead?
5275342 5277712 They have to find<br />the Idaho version of him.
5278311 5279412 I don't know,<br />would a mask work?
5279514 5281314 Is that gonna be convincing?
5281414 5283751 Would another guy<br />with some other affliction,
5283851 5285620 do just as well?
5285720 5287088 I don't know.<br />Maybe they just cast,
5287188 5289857 uh, you know, regular guy<br />like you, right?
5289957 5292093 Or me, right? The way they do<br />Shakespeare now
5292193 5293227 with Black people, right?
5293326 5295963 That puts a different kind<br />of spin on it.
5296063 5298966 So I'm thinking all this<br />stuff during the show, right?
5299066 5300635 I mean, to be honest with you,<br />three hours ago,
5300735 5302369 I'm saying to myself,<br />"Do I really wanna go
5302469 5304972 "and sit in<br />an un-air conditioned theater,
5305072 5306339 "for God knows how long,
5306439 5308475 "to see some little play<br />I've never heard of?"
5308576 5310111 But it's our anniversary.
5310211 5311311 And now I'm thinking<br />all this shit,
5311411 5313581 so that's how I know<br />it's an interesting play.
5334769 5335870 Whoa!
5339240 5340575 Goddammit.
5349482 5350685 Bloody hell.
5352053 5354722 Bollocks. Bollocks.
5357390 5359026 Fuck.
5359126 5360561 Look, you said it yourself.
5360661 5362830 How can he become you?<br />You're nothing alike.
5362930 5365432 It's not believable,<br />and it's not necessary.
5365533 5367467 She loves him for who he is.
5367568 5368803 It was contrived.
5368903 5371739 I still think the idea<br />is theoretically sound.
5371839 5373473 Though,<br />what we didn't count on,
5373574 5375877 and this might just stem<br />from me being a novice,
5375977 5378880 is that the audience has<br />just spent two hours,
5378980 5380214 rooting for Edward.
5380314 5383618 Which, in this particular<br />iteration, is me.
5383718 5385418 If someone else<br />then walks out and goes,
5385519 5386787 "Oh, I'm Edward now,"
5386888 5389824 even if it's<br />Sir Kenneth Branagh,<br />or whomever,
5389924 5391626 the audience<br />will feel cheated.
5391726 5393426 We've broken<br />our pact with them.
5393527 5394528 They'll rightly rebel.
5394629 5396496 Look, I still wanna<br />be friends,
5396597 5398633 and I'll keep you in mind<br />for future projects.
5401869 5403104 The mask is mine.
5404138 5405172 I'm keeping it.
5406340 5408175 I've always liked<br />that mask.
5408276 5409510 Brilliant mask.
5413446 5414749 You know what I think?
5414849 5416449 I think <i>Les Mis</i> is<br />a masterpiece.
5417785 5420688 Uh, The <i>Book of Mormon</i> is<br />hysterically funny.
5423624 5425559 What are you...<br />Do you have any plans for...
5450718 5451919 Where's the blind guy?
5452019 5452987 What are you doing here?
5453087 5455623 -Why are you so upset?<br />-Why are you here?
5456290 5457525 Why was Oswald here?
5457625 5458826 How... How'd you...
5458926 5460261 What business is that<br />of yours?
5460361 5462196 I know because I know.
5462296 5464298 I was passing by and...
5464398 5465633 I don't have to explain<br />myself to you.
5465733 5468202 What do you know about him?<br />Hmm? Who is he?
5468302 5469837 Is his name even Oswald?
5469937 5471138 'Cause let me<br />tell you something,
5471238 5472506 he's got a kid and a girl.
5472606 5474241 He was kissing<br />this other girl,
5474342 5475676 and they were walking<br />in the park.
5475776 5477878 He's leading a double life.<br />What do you think of that?
5477979 5480081 Well, first of all,<br />that's Jolie,
5480181 5483451 Oswald's ex-wife and mother<br />to his daughter, Kelly.
5483551 5485353 And they're still<br />really good friends.
5485453 5486687 And as it happens,
5486787 5488122 Oswald is moving in there.
5488222 5490558 Mr. Sablosky had an accident,<br />and Oswald's been needing
5490658 5491993 a place to stay.<br />I don't even know why
5492093 5493661 I'm bothering<br />to explain this to you.
5493761 5495896 We don't have anything more<br />to say to each other.
5496364 5497631 I'm sorry.
5560628 5561962 What the fuck are you doing?
5566767 5568803 You gotta get<br />the fuck outta here, man.
5587121 5590758 Oh, well,<br />I happen to be Edward now.
5590858 5594095 And this here is Guy.
5594495 5596097 Guy...
5596197 5598099 he's a masterful actor.
5598199 5600000 Thank you man! Yes.
5600734 5602169 Yes, you are...
5606073 5608375 Kenneth Branagh.
5608476 5610444 Come on. Come along, now.
5610545 5612446 Chop, chop.<br />Chop, chop, shake a leg.
5612547 5613714 Shake a leg.
5614482 5615584 What do you think?
5615683 5618085 Hoo!
5618185 5619687 Is it smashing?
5620354 5622156 Or is it smashing?
5622256 5625092 Do you like<br />this room, little girl?
5625192 5629029 I know it's quite small<br />and petite like you.
5629130 5632199 It's a room where you<br />can do anything you want.
5633367 5634802 You know that right?
5634902 5638172 Do you know Peppa Pig? Hmm?
5638272 5641075 Aw, she's a little nervous.<br />She's shy.
5643777 5645779 <i>♪ Don't cry, don't sigh ♪</i>
5645880 5649116 <i>♪ There's a silver lining</i><br /><i>In the sky ♪</i>
5649216 5652186 Naturally,<br />it's a bit disappointing,
5652286 5656525 but I really do hope<br />we can all remain friendly.
5656625 5659160 I harbor no ill feelings.
5659260 5664398 Let us keep our hatreds<br />for the common enemy.
5666667 5667868 Cheers!
5668603 5669837 Thank you.
5669937 5671071 - Can you...<br />- Much obliged!
5671172 5673841 - Okay.<br />- Jesus. Unplug it.
5677211 5678547 Righty then.
5678647 5681482 Fear, is a reaction.
5681583 5684251 Courage, is a decision.
5684885 5686887 I'll miss you<br />most all, darling.
5688255 5692561 - What the fuck?<br />- Ta-ta, for now!
5692661 5694161 Maybe we'll ride<br />to glory together.
5694261 5695429 Whatever you say,<br />my darling.
5695530 5696764 Excuse me, old chap.
5696864 5698866 I think you're<br />kissing my girl!
5698966 5700134 Ah, it appears my understudy,
5700234 5701202 has had a bit<br />too much to drink.
5701302 5702604 Understudy?<br />No, no, no, no.
5702703 5703704 Maybe we could talk<br />about this after the...
5703804 5704905 No, no, no. No, understudy.
5705005 5706040 - After the performance.<br />- I'm Edward!
5706140 5707341 - You...<br />- You're not Edward.
5707441 5708809 - Okay, you're Edward.<br />- No, no, no.
5708909 5710010 - You're Edward.<br />- This is my red door.
5710110 5711078 - This is my couch.<br />- You're Edward.
5711178 5712980 These are my lines!<br />Come here!
5713080 5714583 You stole my life!
5714683 5715883 Get off me!
5715983 5716917 - He's got everything!<br />- What the hell, Guy!
5717017 5718152 - No! I'm Edward!<br />- Calm down,
5718252 5719720 - and we can talk about this.<br />- I'm Edward.
5719820 5721388 Okay, okay.
5721488 5722923 Okay, let go! Let go!
5723023 5724858 I'm gonna leave.<br />I'm gonna leave.
5726393 5730064 Everything's fine.<br />If you sit down, we can talk.
5730164 5730931 No!
5733767 5734835 Take yours off!
5734935 5736904 -Take yours off!<br />-Take what off?
5737004 5738573 -Take yours off!<br />-Take what off?
5741275 5742042 Get over here!
5742142 5744178 Ahhh!
5754556 5755489 Guy.
5759026 5760194 No!
5760294 5761362 Oh my God. Guy!
5761462 5763130 Oh, no. What have I done?<br />What have I done?
5765667 5767501 No! Guy! No, Guy!
5767602 5769403 What have I done?
5769503 5771338 I don't know my own strength.
5771438 5773708 Guy! Guy.
5775009 5776544 I know<br />I keep saying it, man,
5776645 5777646 but it is such an honor.
5777746 5779648 Oh, truly,<br />the honor is all ours.
5779748 5780814 We couldn't be<br />more excited.
5780914 5781915 I mean,<br />frankly, I think
5782016 5783284 - you should be playing it.<br />- Oh, no.
5783384 5785019 - I wouldn't dream of it.<br />- No, honestly, I think
5785119 5786487 you got something special.
5787254 5788389 Real charisma.
5789658 5790924 I mean, it takes a name
5791025 5792826 to get these things funded,<br />as you know.
5792926 5795095 But I want you to know,
5795195 5797298 it's important to me<br />to get it right.
5797398 5800301 And that's why I wanted<br />to spend some time with you,
5800401 5802002 and, you know, uh,
5802102 5805839 not study really,<br />but observe, ask questions.
5805939 5807141 Ah, research,
5807241 5808409 - as they say in the biz.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
5808510 5809977 Well, I think<br />it's important for you
5810077 5811912 to interpret this as you want.
5812012 5813213 - Right.<br />- I mean, Edward was
5813314 5815750 envisioned by Ingrid,<br />and what I was doing earlier,
5815849 5817885 Guy here completely pioneered.
5817985 5820588 - Right on.<br />- I'm interpreting Guy,
5820689 5821822 interpreting Ingrid.
5821922 5823957 And you're just<br />the next and final step
5824058 5825993 in the evolutionary process.
5826093 5827094 Yeah,<br />that's really cool.
5827194 5829430 I'd love to ask you<br />some questions, too.
5831432 5834268 Really cool. Kind of<br />a collaborative thing.
5835770 5837905 Will they be using some...<br />Some mask
5838005 5840941 -or makeup of some sort?<br />-Why?
5843310 5844746 Uh, I don't know.
5844845 5846847 It's beyond my pay grade.
5846947 5849049 I'm... I'm not really part<br />of those discussions.
5849149 5851352 They can do a lot<br />these days to make it<br />look real.
5852286 5853287 Pretty real.
5854388 5857925 But, you know,<br />I don't worry about that stuff.
5858025 5861929 I think as long as I do<br />my job getting Edward right,
5862630 5864298 it'll come through.
5864398 5867334 - The rest is just icing.<br />- Very true.
5867434 5868636 Cheers. Mmm.
5868737 5870037 - Cheers.<br />- Hmm.
5887020 5888889 It's not working.
5892192 5893894 - Whoo!<br />- Fuck!
5894629 5896029 -Fuck.<br />-Number one.
5896130 5897699 That's<br />a cool typewriter.
5897799 5899066 You can have it.

6192727 6194829 What a piece of shit.<br />I don't even allow people
6194929 6196363 to perform that anymore.
6196463 6198633 No, no, no.<br />It was your precocious<br />early work,
6198733 6201703 and it brought us together,<br />so it served that noble cause.
6201803 6203571 Thank God,<br />they didn't make that movie.
6203671 6205173 Oh, I was<br />so disappointed.
6205272 6207909 I really wanted to see<br />that guy try and play me.
6208009 6210645 But anyway, it's brilliant<br />we bumped into you,
6210745 6212847 'cause we're actually<br />moving away next month
6212947 6214148 when the play wraps.
6214247 6215415 Where? Where are you going?
6215516 6217250 To Canada.<br />A place called Shepperton.
6217350 6218753 Have you heard of it?
6218853 6222355 It could be described<br />as a nudist colony.
6222456 6224291 Yeah. It's only a part of it.<br />Small part of it.
6224391 6225425 But yeah,<br />basically we'll be...
6225526 6227294 As God intended.
6227729 6228563 Why?
6228663 6231032 Well, it's a long story.<br />We met this woman
6231132 6232399 -when we were...<br />-Going through the Andes.
6232499 6235268 Yeah. And it turns out<br />she's this incredible person
6235368 6237404 with followers and all that.
6237504 6239674 And it's kind of this<br />ecological philosophy.
6239774 6242210 Mmm-hmm.<br />And... And... And free love.
6242309 6244045 -Yes, but also it's...<br />-And LSD.
6244145 6247515 -Sometimes, yeah, but it's...<br />-Yep. Have you done LSD, Guy?
6248116 6250250 Wha... What about<br />like bad trips?
6250350 6251485 Yeah, it's possible.
6251586 6254222 But it's all really down<br />to how you frame it, Guy.
6254321 6255690 I don't think<br />he could handle it.
6255790 6258626 Yeah. He just needs someone<br />to lead him through it is all.
6258726 6261529 - Which I can do.<br />- Recently certified.
6262864 6263631 And what about your kids?
6263731 6264899 - No.<br />- Yeah, no.
6264999 6265800 They say it's a cult.
6265900 6267034 Yeah. I mean,<br />you probably think
6267135 6268069 it's a cult, too, right?
6268169 6269237 Well, I...<br />I guess it sounds
6269336 6271239 -a little like a cult.<br />-I mean, yeah, sure,
6271338 6273141 if you paint it in<br />like broad brush strokes.
6273241 6275442 But it's... It's really<br />quite leaderless.
6275543 6277344 But what about this,<br />uh, Andes woman,
6277444 6279312 -isn't she like the leader?<br />-Founder.
6279412 6281149 Yes, she set it all in motion.
6281249 6282517 But it's... It's...
6282617 6285586 She's not a guru in the...<br />Well, she's sort of a guru.
6285686 6287487 Yes. She's a guru<br />in the pure sense.
6287588 6289489 Yeah, see we can't talk<br />about it without sounding...
6289590 6290758 Absolutely bonkers.
6290858 6292492 - Mmm.<br />- Yeah. But honestly,
6292593 6294829 It's... It's... It's paradise.
6295830 6296631 Actual paradise.
6296731 6298099 -Like utopia.<br />-Yeah, utopia.
6298199 6299399 -Closest thing to it.<br />-Yeah.
6299499 6301468 And what<br />about your career?
6301569 6303738 Well, I've accomplished<br />everything I've ever wanted...
6303838 6305573 I'm... I'm ready<br />for the next phase.
6305673 6306707 I mean, all she wants<br />to do now,
6306808 6308543 is take LSD<br />and fuck all the time.
6308643 6309811 I mean, you know...
6309911 6312079 Enough about us,<br />what's going on with you?
6312180 6313346 -Tell us everything.<br />-Yeah.
6313446 6316584 Well, I mean.<br />I don't know. Um...
6316684 6319787 Do we know<br />what we would like tonight?
6320721 6322023 What are you thinking, Edward?
6322123 6326694 Uh, you... You go ahead.<br />I'm... I'm still, um...
6326794 6328529 Okay. Well, we're celebrating,
6328629 6330631 so we're gonna need<br />some more sake.
6330731 6333400 Let's do another bottle<br />of the Dassai Hayata.
6333500 6336003 And for the table, the wakame,
6336103 6337839 the agedashi tofu,
6337939 6340308 and he needs<br />to try the uni toast.
6340407 6342510 And an order<br />of the hamachi kama, why not.
6343044 6344712 And for my entree,
6344812 6346479 let's go<br />with the wagyu flight.
6346581 6349116 A miso black cod<br />for me, please. Thank you.
6349217 6350450 And for you sir?
6352687 6353754 Um...
6355056 6356356 Uh...
6357490 6358826 Do you need a minute?
6359794 6361996 Yeah. I, uh...
6363331 6365233 Oh, my old friend.
6365733 6368603 You haven't changed a bit.
