92840 94649 <i>It</i> seemed everyone<br />knew theirs already.
95800 96961 <i>Not me.</i>
97600 99329 <i>I was lost.</i>
100520 102329 <i>I always felt like<br />I saw things</i>

118360 119930 <i>I never said anything.</i>
120760 122205 <i>I didn't want to be different.</i>
123320 124367 <i>Who would?</i>
125160 126571 - [BELL DINGING]<br />- Jonas.
126720 127767 I apologize, we're late.
127920 130127 I got Asher to come<br />say goodbye to Teacher.
130280 131770 I accept your apology.

140040 141724 <i>she was the girl<br />who made everyone smile.</i>

144560 146881 do not make me Vice Chancellor<br />of Waste Management!
147080 148080 Please!
148160 149400 <i>[JONAS] We lived in</i> a <i>world</i>

151560 153210 <i>There was no "popular."</i>
153360 154566 <i>No fame.</i>
154720 156484 <i>No losers and no winners.</i>
157160 158924 <i>Our Elders had eliminated<br />all of that</i>

178920 180524 <i>I'll let you decide.</i>
182320 184288 [FIONA] I'm going to miss<br />volunteering here.
184440 186408 [ASHER] Oh, no.<br />If ever there was a person born
186560 187686 to work at<br />the Nurturing Center...
187840 189410 I could be surprised, right?
190040 191166 Jonas, if you had to guess,
191320 193288 of all the positions the elders<br />picked for me?
195560 196607 Nurturing Center.

198200 200646 [ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Welcome to the Nurturing Center.
203040 204883 [BABIES FUSSING, CRYING]
208520 210249 I got this. I got this.
210400 212482 - Think heavy. Think heavy.<br />- Come on, come on.
215200 216247 [FIONA] We win!
216440 218010 Aren't you my chubby champion?
218160 219720 - Which one was heavier?<br />- [FIONA] Mine.
220040 221040 Asher?
221160 222366 [BABIES CRYING]
222600 224807 Father, I think Fiona<br />put her finger on the scale.
224960 226007 I did not.
226200 227565 [BABY CRYING]
229200 230725 [CRYING CONTINUES]
231200 233931 Aw, this little guy didn't qualify<br />for tomorrow's ceremony.
235080 237526 [FATHER] He's just not strong enough<br />to be assigned to a family yet.
237680 238886 [CRYING]
239040 240929 He looks so unhappy.
241160 243322 - [CRYING CONTINUES]<br />- Hey...
244520 246090 It's okay, Jonas,<br />you can open it.
250560 252483 Yeah, it's Jonas.
252800 254165 Here, let me.
255120 256963 [FIONA] Oh, There you go.<br />There you go.
257120 258120 [BABY QUIETING]
258240 259969 - [WHISPERING] It's okay.<br />- Some people have it, huh?
260120 261200 Well, that's just not fair.
261360 262521 Be strong, Gabriel.
263640 264971 You looked at his name?
265280 266611 Isn't that against the rules?
266760 268000 Yeah, it, it is.
269360 271283 I just thought having a name<br />might help him grow.
272120 274043 So I whisper it to him<br />when no one can hear.
275440 276805 Sometimes I call<br />him Gabe.
278480 279686 [FATHER] But he's usually so restless,
279880 281609 I, I'm not even sure<br />he can hear me.
282440 283440 You okay?
283520 284806 Huh? Yeah.
285200 286200 I'm fine.
286280 287770 So the old man turns<br />to the Elder and says,
287920 289046 "Do you know who I am?"
289320 291288 And the Elder says,<br />"Sir, I know you're old,
291440 293080 but that is no excuse<br />for being prideful."
293200 294611 And then the old man says,
294760 295966 "No, really, I'm asking.
296120 298521 - "Who am I?"<br />- [JONAS AND ASHER LAUGHING]
298760 300125 [FIONA] I don't get it.
300560 302801 [ASHER] "Who am I?" like,<br />like he forgot who he was.
302960 303960 [ELECTRONIC CHIMING]
304040 305480 Okay, but wouldn't<br />the joke be better
305520 307488 - if the old man says...<br />- [ASHER AND JONAS] Okay, one...
307720 309006 - What?<br />- two...
309400 310845 - three!<br />- [BOTH GRUNTING]
311000 312445 - [BOTH LAUGHING]<br />- [FIONA GROANS]
312840 313921 Aren't we graduates now?
314120 315121 [ASHER] You do this every time!
315280 316280 - Come on!<br />- Okay!
316400 317845 One, two, three! [SHRIEKS]
318320 319321 [LAUGHING]
319520 320521 [ASHER] There you go.
320680 322250 [LAUGHING]
323600 325648 So, I guess this is it.
326520 327806 The last night of our childhood.
327960 329849 I guess everything is<br />gonna be different.
330000 331000 No.
331080 333731 Tomorrow the only thing<br />that changes is what we do.
333960 335371 It doesn't change who we are.
335560 336800 QUICK QUESTION: Who are we?
336960 337960 Friends.
338040 339280 - [ASHER] Friends forever.<br />- [FIONA] Yes.
339480 341209 Even when you're both assigned<br />to be Birth Mothers.
341400 342401 [JONAS] Hey!
342560 344528 Well, I guess we'll<br />find out tomorrow, huh?
344680 346240 [ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Citizens are reminded
346320 349529 <i>that evening recreation<br />will end in 30 minutes.</i>
349680 350886 <i>Thank you.</i>
351920 354287 [MOTHER] Well, he did need<br />to be rehabilitated.
354440 357091 And I know he was Lily's Teacher,<br />but what was I supposed to do?
357240 358401 - [FATHER] Hmm.
359600 360647 [MOTHER] I feel...
362480 363480 disappointment.
363560 364766 What was the Elders' decision?
364920 366126 Released to Elsewhere.
366280 368044 Can I be "Released<br />to Elsewhere," Mother?
368200 369531 Even just for one day?
369720 371643 No, you're too young,<br />Lily Billy.
374960 377042 Jonas, your turn for Feelings.
379680 381887 Well, I guess I'm sort of...
383360 384521 terrified.
385440 386771 Precision of language.
387160 388924 I mean anxious.
390640 391721 When you were about to graduate,
391880 394929 did you ever feel like<br />there was no position meant for you?
395280 397282 They've been watching since you<br />were a Newchild.
397840 399444 The Elders are never wrong.
402680 404125 [FATHER] You'll find your place.

1204680 1206330 Simply stated,

1210440 1212488 But why don't people<br />know about them?

1863120 1864485 If you remember.
1865520 1866601 So,
1866800 1868211 forget about it.
1869560 1873167 I don't tell you what to do<br />in your position, so don't tell me.
1873320 1877325 I apologize, but<br />isn't that what's happening now?
1877520 1881002 Your apology is accepted, but<br />you are being careless.
1881920 1883280 [WHISPERS] You're moving too fast.
1883440 1886046 We both know what happened<br />ten years ago with the girl.
1886800 1889610 The girl had a name.
1892280 1894362 You think<br />I don't remember her name?
1895440 1897249 I know you feel her loss.
1908840 1911684 The boy must hold in the pain.
1914240 1915890 Don't fail us again.
1927240 1928685 You want me to read all these?
1929080 1930241 Hmm.
1930400 1931561 What's this?
1931720 1933882 "One day you shall meet a boy
1934040 1936327 who answers<br />to the name of Jonas."
1937480 1940290 "He shall be the most powerful<br />of all the Receivers."
1940440 1941601 Wait. That says...
1941760 1943250 Don't be gullible.
1949920 1951126 Another trick?
1951280 1952725 Actually, no.
1955640 1956971 It's some kind of
1957120 1958246 map.
1958800 1959847 The Triangle of Rocks!
1960000 1962082 Hey, that's real,<br />my friend Asher saw it.
1962840 1964285 Look at all these towers.
1964920 1965920 What were they for?
1966040 1968361 How did your friend see<br />the Triangle of Rocks?
1968520 1971000 He's a pilot.<br />He told me he saw it.
1972040 1973041 What's past there?
1976400 1978209 A mystery.
1978960 1980689 [JONAS] "Boundary of Memory"?<br />Is that what they built
1980840 1983081 so the memories would only<br />stay within you and me?
1983320 1984367 Let's move on.
1984520 1985521 Wait.
1985800 1987962 That boundary is meant<br />to keep memories in.
1988120 1989531 So if a Receiver crosses it,
1990240 1992083 does that mean<br />the memories get set free?
1993400 1994447 Perhaps.
1994600 1996967 Perhaps if you or I crossed it,
1997120 1999361 everyone could feel<br />those memories again.
2000640 2002642 So, what am I seeing today?
2004360 2006044 Nothing.
2007600 2010171 - [WHIRRING, CLACKING]<br />- You're seeing nothing today.
2017160 2019208 We've already covered<br />"seeing beyond."
2020640 2023405 There is also such a thing<br />as "hearing beyond."
2023560 2024800 A table?
2025200 2027328 All the food would<br />slide to the floor.
2030360 2033204 Now, don't judge me.<br />[CHUCKLES]
2033480 2035403 I'm not very good,
2036200 2038680 even though I had<br />a very good Teacher.

2064280 2067807 [PLAYING MELANCHOLY SONG]
2075840 2077490 Just like music,
2078280 2080647 there's something else<br />you can't see with your eyes.
2081600 2085047 Something that lives<br />deep inside you.
2085720 2089964 Something those<br />morning injections take away.
2090760 2093206 But I thought the injections<br />are for our health.
2093600 2095443 No, they remove something.
2095840 2096966 What?
2097920 2099251 Emotions.
2099400 2101209 [TEMPO INCREASES]
2101760 2103205 You mean like feelings?
2105120 2107771 Feelings are just fleeting.
2108080 2109206 On the surface.
2110560 2112244 But emotions,
2112600 2115206 they're very deep, primal.
2115560 2116971 They linger.
2118880 2120211 Now, Jonas...
2121720 2123006 you might not understand
2123160 2125288 where you are<br />or what's happening,
2125480 2127721 but don't think about<br />what you're seeing.
2128680 2130125 Listen.
2132280 2134965 Listen to what's calling<br />from inside.

2235160 2237288 - We should probably get going.<br />- Hello, Jonas.
2238320 2239320 Hello.
2239400 2240526 <i>How is your training?</i>
2240680 2241800 [ELECTRONIC VOICE] Injected.
2241920 2242967 Fine.
2243120 2245043 <i>I am concerned<br />about the Receiver.</i>
2245200 2246440 [ELECTRONIC VOICE] Injected.
2246800 2248802 <i>Many years ago,<br />there was an incident.</i>
2248960 2250450 What kind of incident?
2250680 2256050 <i>Living alone in a building<br />on the Edge can isolate a person.</i>
2256240 2260006 <i>I'm concerned that the<br />Receiver is becoming reckless.</i>
2260920 2263127 <i>Are you being<br />properly prepared?</i>
2263560 2264560 I think so.
2264640 2266449 <i>You're focused?</i>
2267680 2268841 <i>Perhaps you're<br />spending too much time</i>
2269000 2271207 <i>with friends from<br />your childhood.</i>
2271360 2272360 I'm focused.
2272440 2275603 <i>Jonas, what do you<br />and the Receiver actually do?</i>
2275800 2277370 My rules say<br />I'm not allowed to share.
2277520 2278965 She is the Chief Elder.
2279920 2281684 Jonas, she only wants to help.
2282600 2284011 You're right.
2285360 2287522 But you can't tell<br />the Receiver I told you.
2288960 2290291 <i>You have my word.</i>
2290440 2294081 We sit in chairs<br />and don't talk all day long.
2294400 2296528 And then when time is up,<br />I come back here,
2297240 2299561 and in the morning,<br />I do it all again.
2302040 2303963 I apologize, but I'm late.
2305040 2307008 <i>Your apology is accepted.</i>
2308920 2310206 Goodbye, Mother.
2313800 2314920 [ELECTRONIC VOICE] Injected.
2315280 2316805 <i>He's not usually like this.</i>
2317000 2318365 I'm surprised you're not
2318520 2320249 more worried about him.
2322200 2325602 Were he my responsibility,<br />I would be.
2326520 2329126 <i>[JONAS] We'd been told<br />the Chief Elder knew everything.</i>

2330800 2332006 <i>[PLAYING DIDGERIDOO]</i>
2332160 2334561 <i>But I had learned that<br />knowing what something is,</i>
2335760 2338650 <i>is not the same as knowing<br />how something feels.</i>
2341480 2343084 [LAUGHS]
2343440 2344930 You get to be the very best,
2345080 2347321 the last one<br />at the top of the mountain,
2347560 2351167 gasping for air,<br />having survived, and be alone.
2351640 2352880 Be curious.
2353040 2354769 - [JONAS] <i>I got lost.</i><br />- [CROWD CHEERING]
2354920 2356410 <i>The good kind of lost.</i>
2357080 2359890 <i>I saw sights and sounds<br />I had no words to describe.</i>

2365480 2367005 <i>This was forbidden?</i>
2367160 2369811 <i>I didn't know what to think,<br />what to believe.</i>
2370840 2373047 <i>Have faith, the Giver told me.</i>
2373480 2376450 <i>He said faith,<br />that was seeing beyond.</i>
2377000 2380641 <i>He compared it to the wind,<br />something felt but not seen.</i>
2380800 2383007 Don't accept...<br />[CHUCKLES]
2383160 2385208 What is the truth just because
2385400 2387004 it's coming from<br />someone you respect.
2387160 2388685 [JONAS] I feel completely stupid.
2388840 2390205 - I have a weird feeling.<br />- Weird?
2390360 2392010 - It tingles in your hands.<br />- Yes.
2392680 2394967 Memories are not<br />just about the past,
2395680 2397523 they determine our future.
2398200 2399850 You can change things.
2400360 2402249 You can make things better.
2406280 2407964 <i>[JONAS] It was life.</i>
2408800 2411087 <i>It just seemed more complete.</i>
2413000 2416368 <i>The more I experienced,<br />the more I wanted.</i>
2417680 2421571 <i>[GIVER] Once, there were<br />other living things.</i>
2422880 2424644 <i>But unlike us,</i>
2424880 2427770 <i>they knew who their mothers<br />and fathers were.</i>
2428880 2430769 <i>They had Joy</i>
2431360 2432964 and they had pain.
2435320 2437721 I can't prepare you for<br />what's going to happen...
2437880 2439291 You don't need to warn me<br />every single time.
2439440 2441727 No, Jonas, you don't understand.
2441880 2443370 There was tremendous cruelty.
2443520 2445761 Giver, I'm not a kid any more.

2722920 2724206 - Okay?<br />- Okay,
2724360 2728001 If you asked, "Do you enjoy me?"<br />the answer is certainly yes.

2867200 2868200 What...
2868280 2869930 No. I'm sorry, Jonas.
2870080 2871525 How did people do that?
2871720 2873848 I didn't mean<br />for you to receive that.
2874720 2876051 Not for years.
2876600 2879251 Don't let this turn you away.
2879480 2880720 I'm not strong enough.
2880880 2881927 Of course not yet!

2884720 2886449 so we can advise.
2888000 2889286 I can't.
2889520 2890760 I'm sorry.

2992120 2993804 I know you.
2993960 2995041 You do, do you?

2997280 2998441 What do you think<br />would happen

3001000 3002240 If you skipped it.
3002400 3004801 Then the sensor would blink<br />and remind me that I forgot it.
3004960 3006200 No, I don't mean if you forgot.
3006320 3008846 I mean, what do you think<br />would happen if you chose
3009000 3010650 not to be injected?
3011200 3012884 Jonas, I thought<br />something was wrong.
3013040 3014530 There is something wrong.
3014680 3015886 Everything is wrong.
3016280 3017441 I quit.
3017600 3019329 Fiona, I'm done being the Receiver.
3020120 3021724 Tomorrow morning,<br />skip your injection.
3021880 3022880 What? You quit?
3022960 3024724 Prick your finger and put<br />a little blood on this apple.
3024880 3025880 No, you can't quit.
3026000 3027729 If you quit your position,<br />you get sent to Elsewhere.
3027920 3029809 When you leave in the morning,<br />put the apple over the sensor.
3030000 3031570 It'll find your blood<br />and think it's your hand.
3031720 3032926 Stop, you're scaring me.
3033080 3035367 Fiona, I need you to do this.<br />I need you to feel what I know it's...
3035520 3036726 Jonas.
3037520 3038885 An apple wouldn't even work.
3039040 3042362 I've been doing it for months,<br />and it's worked every single time.
3043920 3045001 Don't quit.
3045160 3046366 You can't leave.
3049040 3051646 I don't think I can<br />go back to that place.

3058280 3059884 Okay. Fine.

3125120 3126120 [ROSEMARY] Yeah.
3126200 3127884 I want to teach you.
3135480 3136845 You've come back.
3137560 3138800 Where did you learn that?
3138960 3140450 From the memory<br />you gave me.
3140600 3142204 [GIVER] And you can<br />just play it?
3142360 3143521 Mm-hmm.
3144280 3145280 That's beautiful.
3145360 3146282 - [JONAS] Who's that?<br />- Thanks.

3150280 3152089 The previous Receiver.
3152480 3154721 - See?<br />- She's the one they all talk about.
3155960 3158406 [HUMMING TO MUSIC]
3158560 3160608 She no longer exists.
3160800 3161960 Remember? [CONTINUES HUMMING]
3162080 3163844 Except here.
3164440 3166408 And in my memories.
3166880 3169963 [HUMMING]
3170960 3173691 She was in training<br />only two short months.
3173920 3177083 ♪ Watch how my fingers move ♪
3177520 3178965 And like you,
3180040 3182008 she wanted to experience,
3183040 3184769 well, everything.
3184960 3187770 I only gave her pleasant,<br />beautiful memories.
3187920 3189570 Three, four...
3189720 3191006 She fought me.
3191160 3192400 - Don't protect me.<br />- No!
3192560 3195166 Don't show me a map and then<br />not give me all the memories.
3195320 3196480 I thought we were gonna help.
3196520 3198204 We will, but we must move slow.
3198360 3199725 Show it to me.
3200440 3201965 You gave her war?
3205320 3208130 [GIVER] I gave her<br />the memory of a child...
3209200 3212090 A child taken from her mother.
3212960 3214849 I gave her loss.
3215920 3217490 Too soon.
3217640 3219847 You're gonna get<br />the hang of this.
3220680 3222808 The light went from her eyes.
3222960 3224849 [HUMMING]
3225080 3228163 The next morning,<br />without telling me,
3228800 3232168 she went to the Chief Elder<br />and asked to be Released.
3234440 3235851 So she was Released?
3236040 3237610 And now lives in Elsewhere?

3310360 3312010 are too teeny weenie.
3312200 3314123 Almost, almost...
3314400 3315400 Done.
3315520 3317488 That wasn't so bad now, was it?
3324880 3326245 That's death.
3326400 3327731 He doesn't know what he's doing.
3327880 3330360 Doesn't know what he's doing?
3331680 3332680 He killed him.
3332760 3334410 But he doesn't know<br />what it means.
3335480 3336845 Just like you didn't.
3337120 3338849 Neither did Rosemary.
3339520 3341249 How can he not see<br />the baby isn't moving?
3341440 3343090 Doesn't that tell him<br />something is wrong?
3343240 3345641 The young and the old<br />are killed.
3345880 3347120 You're friend, Fiona,
3347320 3349721 she will soon be trained<br />to Release as well.
3349920 3351604 That's a lie.
3351920 3353251 She'd never do that.
3353400 3354400 If Fiona understood...
3354480 3356881 We are the only ones<br />who understand it.
3357120 3358360 Then it's our fault.
3358520 3360124 You and me and<br />all the Receivers
3360280 3362203 back and back and back<br />and back and back.
3362360 3364044 There has to be a way<br />to show them,
3364200 3367124 to give them the memories<br />so they can understand.
3367280 3369886 - Yes.<br />- Because if you can't feel,
3371000 3372161 what's the point?
3372320 3373810 But what can you do?
3382000 3383570 [ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Citizens are reminded
3383720 3387167 <i>that evening recreation will end<br />in 30 minutes.</i>
3387360 3388805 <i>Thank you.</i>
3412000 3413000 Did it work?
3413080 3414684 I don't know how long it takes<br />for the injections
3414840 3416365 to leave you, whether a day<br />was long enough or...
3416520 3418443 Why did I do this, Jonas?
3419160 3421766 On the walk here, I was thinking<br />of how I would scold you.
3422080 3424481 How I would say,<br />"Oh, it's fine for you
3424640 3426768 to break the rules<br />because you're chosen."
3426920 3428922 When I thought<br />about telling you,
3429080 3430844 I just, I...
3431760 3433410 I began to think about you.
3433560 3434891 [GASPS SOFTLY]
3438000 3439411 Is this okay?
3443680 3445489 Do you feel anything?
3447240 3448526 [FIONA] It feels like...
3448680 3449680 [JONAS] Fiona,
3449840 3451330 - what do you feel?<br />- I don't know.
3451480 3454131 I don't have the<br />words to describe it.
3454560 3455561 Warm?
3455760 3456921 Does it feel warm?
3457200 3458201 Warm?
3458360 3460283 Does it feel nice?
3467960 3469405 [GASPS]<br />No, um...
3469560 3470560 I, I'm on night shift.
3470640 3471687 I need to...
3471960 3473610 I don't feel right, Jonas.
3473760 3475205 I need to go and<br />get my injection.
3475360 3477203 I need to go to work.
3488200 3489531 What was that?
3489680 3491205 Fiona, there is more.
3491640 3493290 So much more.
3506200 3507770 <i>[JONAS] I remembered it now.</i>
3508200 3509850 <i>I had dreamed of her.</i>
3510160 3511764 <i>When I was younger.</i>
3512680 3514170 <i>I told my parents.</i>
3514800 3516882 <i>"It was the Stirrings",<br />they said.</i>
3517480 3519050 <i>Everyone had them.</i>

3525280 3527726 And Teacher said,<br />"That's right, Lily."
3527920 3529524 Very good.
3529920 3531126 Jonas.
3531280 3533328 Just in time for Feelings.
3533600 3535250 - Lily was telling us how she...<br />- Where's Gabe?
3535400 3537482 Uncertain was returned<br />to the Nurturing Center.
3537800 3538847 What happened?
3539000 3540650 Well, he failed his<br />Test of Maturity.
3541320 3542320 Again.
3542400 3543890 I couldn't ask<br />for another extension,
3544040 3545883 so I'll have to Release him<br />to Elsewhere.
3546880 3547880 Release him?
3548000 3550082 Well, we certainly gave it<br />our best try, didn't we?
3552120 3553485 But he's family.
3553640 3555688 Precision of language, please.
3556080 3557286 [FATHER] Sit down.
3557840 3559330 Eat with us.
3562040 3563804 I just need to rest for a while.

3618000 3620128 [TIRES SCRAPING]
3620800 3622882 Jonas, what are you doing?<br />It's against the rules
3623040 3624451 to leave your<br />community this late.
3624640 3626881 Asher, there's something<br />I have to do that is right,
3627040 3628166 but is sort of<br />against the rules.
3628320 3630163 If it's the right thing to do,
3630560 3631971 how can it be against the rules?
3632160 3633207 There are things<br />that I've learned
3633400 3634686 that you don't know<br />that you can't know,
3634840 3636080 - not because it's your fault...<br />- Jonas,
3636240 3637526 you need to go back<br />to your family unit.
3637680 3639284 But that's the point.
3639440 3641920 It isn't my family,<br />and neither is yours.
3642080 3643366 - Asher, I got to go.<br />- Jonas, listen.
3643520 3645284 - Get out of my way.<br />- Jonas, stop!
3645440 3647124 [GRUNTING]
3671240 3672526 Giver!
3673680 3675330 Giver, wake up.
3675840 3677649 I'd have to be sleeping<br />to wake up.
3677800 3679882 Something can be done.<br />Something can be done.
3680040 3681040 What are you proposing?
3681160 3682491 All the memories back<br />and back and back
3682640 3683640 can be returned.
3683760 3684960 I need to leave the Community.
3685040 3686520 I need to find the<br />Boundary of Memory.
3686640 3687640 And then?
3687720 3688801 And then cross it.
3688960 3690610 - No more discussions.<br />- Slowly.
3690760 3691760 Gabe is in danger.
3691840 3693444 - Slowly.<br />- I can't wait any more.
3693600 3695090 Something must be done.
3697800 3700121 If you had that map, then<br />why didn't you try to leave?
3700280 3701441 I was waiting
3701640 3703369 for someone like you.
3704040 3705769 You are the reason<br />we have a chance.
3705960 3710010 So, the plan will be for you<br />to go and for me to stay.
3710160 3711889 If you did cross this Boundary,
3712960 3714405 [SIGHS] and if the memories<br />were set free,
3714600 3715800 all of the pain that you felt,
3715920 3718082 all the confusion, the chaos,
3718240 3719366 it would all return.

4931440 4933761 I've felt real joy.
4933920 4935809 [CHIEF ELDER] Then you should know
4936360 4938761 better than anyone.
4940080 4942606 You have seen children starve.
4942760 4943761 [GRUNTS]
4943920 4945285 You've seen people
4945440 4947169 stand on each other's necks
4947320 4949084 just for the view.
4950200 4953329 You know what it feels like<br />when men blow each other up.
4953480 4954480 Yes.
4954560 4956403 Over a simple line in the sand.
4956560 4957766 I do, l do, but...
4957920 4959285 And yet...
4959440 4960521 And yet,
4960720 4962802 you and Jonas want to
4963240 4964765 <i>open that door again,</i>
4964920 4966206 bring all that back.
4966360 4968966 If you could only see<br />the possibility of love.
4969120 4970690 - Why?<br />- Of love.
4970920 4972560 - Love is just...<br />- With love comes faith,
4972640 4973640 with it comes hope.
4973720 4976371 Love is just passion<br />that can turn.
4977000 4978525 We can do better.
4978680 4980040 It turns into contempt and murder.
4980200 4981690 We could choose better.
4981840 4982966 [CHUCKLES]
4984400 4985481 People are weak.
4985640 4987529 People are selfish.
4989040 4991202 When people have the freedom<br />to choose,
4991880 4993120 they choose wrong
4993800 4995529 every single time.

5094200 5096009 [GRUNTING]
5110000 5111286 That girl,
5111960 5112960 she has felt it.
5113040 5114040 That's enough.
5114120 5116407 We are living a life of shadows,
