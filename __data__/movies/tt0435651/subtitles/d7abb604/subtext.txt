78762 80460 <i>I don't have a last name.</i>

89711 92893 <i>Tomorrow we'd be assigned<br />our jobs, our purpose.</i>
93747 96054 <i>It seemed everyone<br />knew theirs already.</i>
96704 98364 <i>Not me.</i>
98502 100729 <i>I was lost.</i>
101419 103726 <i>I always felt like I saw things</i>

119242 121310 <i>I never said anything.</i>
121639 123582 <i>I didn't want to be different.</i>

126035 127493 - [BELL DINGING]<br />- Jonas.
127593 128692 I apologize, we're late.
128792 131050 I got Asher to come say<br />goodbye to Teacher.

143817 145316 Whoever is listening, please, please,
145415 147833 do not make me Vice Chancellor<br />of Waste Management!
147933 148912 Please!
149012 150311 <i>[JONAS] We lived in a world</i>
150410 152309 <i>where differences weren't allowed.</i>
152408 154107 <i>There was no "popular."</i>

155565 157827 <i>No losers and no winners.</i>
158003 159821 <i>Our Elders had eliminated all of that</i>

179741 181843 <i>I'll let you decide.</i>
183138 185156 [FIONA]<br />I'm going to miss volunteering here.
185256 187274 [ASHER] Oh, no. If ever<br />there was a person born
187373 190720 - to work at the Nurturing Center...<br />- I could be surprised, right?
190850 192029 Jonas, if you had to guess,
192129 194594 of all the positions the<br />elders picked for me?
196364 197503 Nurturing Center.
197603 198902 [CLUNKING]
199002 201945 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Welcome to the Nurturing Center.</i>
203837 206178 [BABIES FUSSING, CRYING]
209311 211090 I got this. I got this.
211190 213769 - Think heavy. Think heavy.<br />- Come on, come on.
215985 217124 [FIONA] We win!
217224 218842 Aren't you my chubby champion?
218942 220720 - Which one was heavier?<br />- [FIONA] Mine.
220820 221839 Asher?
221939 223277 [BABIES CRYING]
223377 225635 Father, I think Fiona put<br />her finger on the scale.
225735 226874 I did not.
226974 228837 [BABY CRYING]
229971 231869 [CRYING CONTINUES]
231969 235197 Aw, this little guy didn't<br />qualify for tomorrow's ceremony.
235845 238342 [FATHER] He's just not strong enough<br />to be assigned to a family yet.
238442 239701 [CRYING]
239801 241819 He looks so unhappy.
241919 244578 - [CRYING CONTINUES]<br />- Hey...
245275 247343 It's okay, Jonas, you can open it.
251309 253447 Yeah, it's Jonas.
253547 255410 Here, let me.
255865 257763 [FIONA]<br />Oh, There you go. There you go.
257863 258882 [BABY QUIETING]
258982 260760 - [WHISPERING] It's okay.<br />- Some people have it, huh?
260860 261999 Well, that's just not fair.
262099 263758 Be strong, Gabriel.
264376 265915 You looked at his name?
266015 267393 Isn't that against the rules?
267493 269231 Yeah, it, it is.
270091 272511 I just thought having a<br />name might help him grow.
272848 275268 So I whisper it to him<br />when no one can hear.
276165 278028 Sometimes I call him Gabe.
279202 280500 [FATHER]<br />But he's usually so restless,
280600 282827 I, I'm not even sure he can hear me.
283158 284137 You okay?
284236 285815 Huh? Yeah.
285915 286894 I'm fine.
286994 288532 So the old man turns<br />to the Elder and says,
288632 289931 "Do you know who I am?"
290031 292049 And the Elder says,<br />"Sir, I know you're old,
292149 293807 but that is no excuse<br />for being prideful."
293907 296724 And then the old man says,<br />"No, really, I'm asking.
296824 299361 - Who am I?"<br />- [JONAS AND ASHER LAUGHING]
299461 301160 [FIONA] I don't get it.
301259 303557 [ASHER] "Who am I?" like,<br />like he forgot who he was.
303657 304636 [ELECTRONIC CHIMING]
304736 306115 Okay, but wouldn't the joke be better
306214 308312 - if the old man says...<br />- [ASHER AND JONAS] Okay, one...
308412 309991 - What?<br />- ...two...
310091 311589 - ...three!<br />- [BOTH GRUNTING]
311689 313427 - [BOTH LAUGHING]<br />- [FIONA GROANS]
313527 314706 Aren't we graduates now?
314806 315865 [ASHER] You do this every time!
315965 316984 - Come on!<br />- Okay!
317084 318902 One, two, three! [SHRIEKS]
319002 320101 [LAUGHING]
320200 321259 [ASHER] There you go.
321359 323427 [LAUGHING]
324276 326822 So, I guess this is it.
327193 328532 The last night of our childhood.
328632 330570 I guess everything is<br />gonna be different.
330670 331649 No.
331749 334526 Tomorrow the only thing<br />that changes is what we do.
334626 336125 It doesn't change who we are.
336224 337523 Quick question: Who are we?
337623 338602 Friends.
338702 340041 - [ASHER] Friends forever.<br />- [FIONA] Yes.
340141 341959 Even when you're both<br />assigned to be Birth Mothers.
342059 343118 [JONAS] Hey!
343217 345235 Well, I guess we'll<br />find out tomorrow, huh?
345335 346874 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Citizens are reminded</i>
346974 350230 <i>that evening recreation<br />will end in 30 minutes.</i>
350330 352035 <i>Thank you.</i>
352568 354986 [MOTHER] Well, he did<br />need to be rehabilitated.
355086 357783 And I know he was Lily's Teacher,<br />but what was I supposed to do?
357883 359542 - [FATHER] Hmm.
360240 361786 [MOTHER] I feel...
363118 364097 disappointment.
364196 365455 What was the Elders' decision?
365555 366814 Released to Elsewhere.
366914 368732 Can I be "Released to<br />Elsewhere," Mother?
368832 370250 Even just for one day?
370350 372771 No, you're too young, Lily Billy.
375585 378164 Jonas, your turn for Feelings.
380300 383005 Well, I guess I'm sort of...
383977 385636 terrified.
386055 387673 Precision of language.
387773 390035 I mean anxious.
391249 392388 When you were about to graduate,
392488 395785 did you ever feel like there<br />was no position meant for you?
395885 398342 They've been watching since<br />you were a Newchild.
398442 400544 The Elders are never wrong.
403277 405220 [FATHER] You'll find your place.

1201398 1204375 No, no. It's a very distant memory.
1204475 1209536 Simply stated, there is no snow<br />because of climate control.
1210230 1212327 But why don't people know about them?

1940818 1942806 Don't be gullible.
1948970 1950229 Another trick?
1950329 1952272 Actually, no.
1954684 1957741 It's some kind of map.
1957841 1958940 The Triangle of Rocks!
1959040 1961619 Hey, that's real,<br />my friend Asher saw it.
1961877 1963820 Look at all these towers.
1963955 1964974 What were they for?
1965074 1967452 How did your friend see<br />the Triangle of Rocks?
1967551 1970529 He's a pilot. He told me he saw it.
1971068 1972567 What's past there?
1975424 1977730 A mystery.
1977981 1979759 [JONAS] "Boundary of Memory"?<br />Is that what they built
1979859 1982237 so the memories would only<br />stay within you and me?
1982337 1983436 Let's move on.
1983535 1984714 Wait.
1984814 1987032 That boundary is meant<br />to keep memories in.
1987132 1989041 So if a Receiver crosses it,
1989250 1991590 does that mean the<br />memories get set free?
1992407 1993505 Perhaps.
1993605 1996023 Perhaps if you or I crossed it,
1996123 1998861 everyone could feel<br />those memories again.
1999639 2002139 So, what am I seeing today?
2003356 2005537 Nothing.
2006592 2009660 - [WHIRRING, CLACKING]<br />- You're seeing nothing today.
2016143 2018688 We've already covered<br />"seeing beyond."
2019619 2022437 There is also such a thing<br />as "hearing beyond."
2022536 2024075 A table?
2024175 2026800 All the food would<br />slide to the floor.
2029330 2032347 Now, don't judge me. [CHUCKLES]
2032447 2034867 I'm not very good,
2035164 2038141 even though I had<br />a very good Teacher.

2074764 2076912 Just like music,
2077202 2080066 there's something else you<br />can't see with your eyes.
2080518 2084461 Something that lives deep inside you.
2084634 2089374 Something those morning<br />injections take away.
2089669 2092407 But I thought the injections<br />are for our health.
2092506 2094644 No, they remove something.
2094744 2096369 What?
2096822 2098201 Emotions.
2098301 2100558 [TEMPO INCREASES]
2100658 2102601 You mean like feelings?
2104015 2106872 Feelings are just fleeting.
2106972 2108596 On the surface.
2109449 2111387 But emotions,
2111487 2114345 they're very deep, primal.
2114444 2116354 They linger.
2117761 2119590 Now, Jonas...
2120598 2124255 you might not understand where<br />you are or what's happening,
2124355 2127093 but don't think about<br />what you're seeing.
2127551 2129494 Listen.
2131148 2134330 Listen to what's calling from inside.

2238161 2239339 <i>How is your training?</i>
2239439 2240578 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE] Injected.</i>
2240678 2241777 Fine.
2241877 2243855 <i>I am concerned about the Receiver.</i>
2243955 2245453 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE] Injected.</i>
2245553 2247611 <i>Many years ago,<br />there was an incident.</i>
2247711 2249329 What kind of incident?
2249429 2254884 <i>Living alone in a building on<br />the Edge can isolate a person.</i>
2254984 2259245 <i>I'm concerned that the<br />Receiver is becoming reckless.</i>
2259659 2262197 <i>Are you being properly prepared?</i>
2262296 2263275 I think so.
2263375 2265682 <i>You're focused?</i>
2266412 2269989 <i>Perhaps you're spending too much time<br />with friends from your childhood.</i>
2270089 2271068 I'm focused.
2271168 2274424 <i>Jonas, what do you and<br />the Receiver actually do?</i>
2274524 2276143 My rules say I'm not<br />allowed to share.
2276242 2278186 She is the Chief Elder.
2278640 2280902 Jonas, she only wants to help.
2281317 2283226 You're right.
2284075 2286734 But you can't tell the<br />Receiver I told you.
2287671 2289050 <i>You have my word.</i>
2289150 2293006 We sit in chairs and<br />don't talk all day long.
2293106 2295731 And then when time is up,<br />I come back here,
2295943 2298761 and in the morning,<br />I do it all again.
2300738 2303159 I apologize, but I'm late.
2303735 2306200 <i>Your apology is accepted.</i>

2315683 2319428 I'm surprised you're not<br />more worried about him.
2320878 2324776 Were he my responsibility,<br />I would be.
2325193 2327971 <i>[JONAS] We'd been told the<br />Chief Elder knew everything.</i>

2365793 2368941 <i>I didn't know what<br />to think, what to believe.</i>
2369469 2372007 <i>Have faith, the Giver told me.</i>
2372107 2375523 <i>He said faith,<br />that was seeing beyond.</i>
2375623 2379319 <i>He compared it to the wind,<br />something felt but not seen.</i>
2379419 2381677 Don't accept... [CHUCKLES]
2381777 2383915 What is the truth just because
2384015 2385673 it's coming from someone you respect.
2385773 2387351 [JONAS] I feel completely stupid.
2387451 2388870 - I have a weird feeling.<br />- Weird?
2388970 2391117 - It tingles in your hands.<br />- Yes.
2391287 2394072 Memories are not just about the past,
2394284 2396625 they determine our future.
2396802 2398860 You can change things.
2398960 2401346 You can make things better.
2404874 2407056 <i>[JONAS] It was life.</i>
2407391 2410175 <i>It just seemed more complete.</i>

2427451 2429829 <i>They had joy</i>
2429929 2432031 and they had pain.
2433885 2436342 I can't prepare you for<br />what's going to happen...
2436442 2437901 You don't need to warn<br />me every single time.
2438001 2440338 No, Jonas, you don't understand.
2440438 2441977 There was tremendous cruelty.

2607791 2611167 A combination of reality,<br />fantasy, emotions
2611267 2612925 and what you had for dinner.
2613025 2614968 [CHUCKLES]
2617381 2620609 You've stopped taking your<br />injections, haven't you?
2625013 2627751 The emotion was so strong.

2639759 2641383 Yes.
2642036 2644662 We don't have that any more.
2645713 2647691 What do you mean by "that"?
2647791 2652769 Well, I'm talking about what<br />you feel for someone else.
2654064 2657241 And the mind can't<br />explain it and you...
2657341 2659399 You can't make it go away.
2659499 2660518 What is it?
2660618 2662527 Love.
2663695 2666876 It's called love.

2679719 2681577 [CHUCKLES] What's new with you?
2681677 2683983 What's ever new?
2687671 2689409 Why are you being weird?
2689509 2691287 I'm not.

2713924 2715463 What does "love" mean?
2715563 2717141 - [GABRIEL CRYING]<br />- I got him, Lily.
2717241 2718620 Jonas used a word so antiquated
2718720 2721097 that it no longer<br />has any application.
2721197 2722536 - Okay?<br />- Okay.
2722636 2726772 If you asked, "Do you enjoy me?"<br />the answer is certainly yes.
2727231 2730459 Or do Mother and I take pride<br />in your accomplishments?
2730907 2732486 Well, of course we do.

2933145 2934763 Come on. You're just in time.

2938180 2940597 <i>[JONAS]<br />I didn't ever want to go back.</i>
2940697 2944640 <i>I didn't want the wisdom,<br />didn't want the pain.</i>
2945333 2947511 <i>I wanted my childhood again.</i>
2947610 2950349 <i>Scraped knees and ball games.</i>
2950847 2953393 <i>Back then, we'd played war.</i>
2953884 2955982 <i>But war was real.</i>
2956082 2958500 <i>The Elders understood that.</i>
2958599 2960940 <i>They'd erased it from our world.</i>

2978579 2981556 - Could you watch over Harry for me?<br />- Of course.
2986092 2988274 [FIONA] Hey, what's wrong?
2988689 2990028 Nothing.
2990128 2991866 I know you.
2991966 2993105 You do, do you?
2993205 2994704 Yes.
2995283 2996541 What do you think would happen
2996641 2998584 if you skipped your<br />morning injection?
2998999 3000298 If you skipped it.
3000398 3002855 Then the sensor would blink and<br />remind me that I forgot it.
3002955 3004214 No, I don't mean if you forgot.
3004314 3006891 I mean, what do you think<br />would happen if you chose
3006991 3009089 not to be injected?
3009189 3010927 Jonas, I thought something was wrong.
3011027 3012565 There is something wrong.
3012665 3014164 Everything is wrong.
3014264 3015483 I quit.
3015582 3017809 Fiona, I'm done being the Receiver.
3018100 3019758 Tomorrow morning,<br />skip your injection.
3019858 3020837 What? You quit?
3020937 3022755 Prick your finger and put<br />a little blood on this apple.
3022855 3023874 No, you can't quit.
3023974 3025792 If you quit your position,<br />you get sent to Elsewhere.
3025892 3027870 When you leave in the morning,<br />put the apple over the sensor.
3027970 3029588 It'll find your blood and<br />think it's your hand.
3029688 3030947 Stop, you're scaring me.
3031047 3033385 Fiona, I need you to do this.<br />I need you to feel what I know it's...
3033484 3035189 Jonas.
3035482 3036901 An apple wouldn't even work.
3037001 3040819 I've been doing it for months,<br />and it's worked every single time.
3041876 3043015 Don't quit.
3043115 3044819 You can't leave.
3046991 3050094 I don't think I can go<br />back to that place.
3054064 3056052 You will if you want me to do this.
3056222 3058324 Okay. Fine.
3059419 3062203 But tomorrow after work,<br />meet me in the triangle.
3064773 3066991 <i>[JONAS]<br />I wanted to share it with her.</i>

3104413 3105992 - [ROSEMARY] Hello?<br />- [MELANCHOLY SONG PLAYING]
3106092 3108429 I have something to show you.
3108529 3112825 [MELANCHOLY SONG CONTINUES]
3113285 3115546 Come here.
3117400 3119264 Who are you?
3120637 3121816 Come over and try this.
3121916 3122895 - Me?<br />- [GIVER] Me?
3122995 3123974 [ROSEMARY] Yeah.
3124074 3126256 I want to teach you.
3133345 3135208 You've come back.
3135422 3136721 Where did you learn that?
3136821 3138359 From the memory you gave me.
3138459 3140118 [GIVER] And you can just play it?
3140218 3141877 Mm-hmm.
3142136 3143115 That's beautiful.
3143215 3144194 - [JONAS] Who's that?<br />- Thanks.
3144294 3147919 - This is Rosemary.<br />- I'll show you.
3148130 3150228 The previous Receiver.
3150328 3153066 - See?<br />- She's the one they all talk about.
3153804 3156302 [HUMMING TO MUSIC]
3156401 3158539 She no longer exists.
3158639 3159818 Remember? [CONTINUES HUMMING]
3159918 3162176 Except here.
3162276 3164613 And in my memories.
3164713 3168293 [HUMMING]
3168789 3171646 She was in training<br />only two short months.
3171746 3175243 ♪ Watch how my fingers move ♪
3175342 3177286 And like you,
3177860 3180325 she wanted to experience,
3180857 3182675 well, everything.
3182775 3185632 I only gave her pleasant,<br />beautiful memories.
3185732 3187430 Three, four...
3187530 3188869 She fought me.
3188969 3190268 - Don't protect me.<br />- No!
3190367 3193025 Don't show me a map and then<br />not give me all the memories.
3193125 3196062 - I thought we were gonna help.<br />- We will, but we must move slow.
3196162 3198025 Show it to me.
3198240 3200263 You gave her war?
3203115 3206421 [GIVER]<br />I gave her the memory of a child...
3206991 3210377 A child taken from her mother.
3210747 3213134 I gave her loss.
3213704 3215322 Too soon.
3215422 3218127 You're gonna get the hang of this.
3218459 3220637 The light went from her eyes.
3220737 3222755 [HUMMING]
3222855 3226434 The next morning, without telling me,
3226571 3230435 she went to the Chief Elder<br />and asked to be Released.
3232206 3233704 So she was Released?
3233804 3235872 And now lives in Elsewhere?
3238719 3239938 [DEVICE CHIMES]
3240038 3241097 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE] Yes, Receiver?</i>
3241197 3243175 I would like to see<br />this morning's Release.

3251346 3252325 This one is heavier.
3252425 3253684 [JONAS] More twins. Great.
3253784 3256091 - Watch.<br />- [FATHER] Oh, good.
3256861 3259199 For a moment, I thought<br />they'd be exactly the same.
3259298 3260277 Here we go.
3260377 3261916 Then we'd have a problem.
3262016 3263834 [SOFTLY] Okay, okay.
3263934 3265632 Thank you, Dinah.
3265732 3268309 - Yes, yes, yes, yes.<br />- And you,

3293145 3295088 [CRYING STOPS]
3301057 3303035 Oh, I know it hurts, I know.
3303135 3305472 I know, I know.
3305572 3307950 But I have to use a vein,<br />and the ones in your arms
3308050 3309788 are too teeny weenie.
3309888 3311986 Almost, almost...
3312086 3313105 Done.
3313204 3315670 That wasn't so bad now, was it?
3322555 3323974 That's death.
3324074 3325452 He doesn't know what he's doing.
3325552 3328529 Doesn't know what he's doing?
3329348 3330327 He killed him.
3330427 3332575 But he doesn't know what it means.
3333145 3334683 Just like you didn't.
3334783 3337010 Neither did Rosemary.
3337180 3338999 How can he not see the<br />baby isn't moving?
3339099 3340797 Doesn't that tell him<br />something is wrong?
3340897 3343434 The young and the old are killed.
3343534 3344873 You're friend, Fiona,
3344973 3347470 she will soon be trained<br />to Release as well.
3347570 3349468 That's a lie.
3349568 3350947 She'd never do that.
3351047 3352026 If Fiona understood...
3352126 3354663 We are the only ones<br />who understand it.
3354763 3356062 Then it's our fault.
3356161 3357820 You and me and all the Receivers
3357920 3359898 back and back and back<br />and back and back.
3359998 3361736 There has to be a way to show them,
3361836 3364813 to give them the memories<br />so they can understand.
3364913 3368016 - Yes.<br />- Because if you can't feel,
3368629 3369848 what's the point?
3369948 3371936 But what can you do?
3379618 3381236 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Citizens are reminded</i>
3381336 3384873 <i>that evening recreation<br />will end in 30 minutes.</i>
3384973 3386916 <i>Thank you.</i>
3409588 3410567 Did it work?
3410667 3412325 I don't know how long it<br />takes for the injections
3412425 3414004 to leave you, whether a<br />day was long enough or...
3414103 3416524 Why did I do this, Jonas?
3416741 3419558 On the walk here, I was thinking<br />of how I would scold you.
3419658 3422115 How I would say,<br />"Oh, it's fine for you
3422215 3424393 to break the rules<br />because you're chosen."
3424493 3428913 When I thought about<br />telling you, I just, I...
3429328 3431027 I began to think about you.
3431126 3432956 [GASPS SOFTLY]
3435562 3437471 Is this okay?
3441236 3443543 Do you feel anything?
3444793 3446131 [FIONA] It feels like...
3446231 3447290 [JONAS] Fiona,
3447390 3448929 - what do you feel?<br />- I don't know.
3449029 3452006 I don't have the<br />words to describe it.
3452105 3453204 Warm?
3453304 3454643 Does it feel warm?
3454743 3455802 Warm?
3455902 3458322 Does it feel nice?
3465492 3466991 [GASPS] No, um...
3467090 3468069 I, I'm on night shift.
3468169 3469388 I need to...
3469488 3471186 I don't feel right, Jonas.
3471286 3472785 I need to go and get my injection.
3472885 3475225 I need to go to work.
3485712 3487090 What was that?
3487190 3489048 Fiona, there is more.
3489148 3491296 So much more.
3503694 3505592 <i>[JONAS] I remembered it now.</i>
3505692 3507550 <i>I had dreamed of her.</i>
3507650 3509752 <i>When I was younger.</i>
3510167 3512155 <i>I told my parents.</i>
3512285 3514863 <i>"It was the Stirrings they said.</i>
3514963 3516701 <i>Everyone had them.</i>
3516801 3519098 <i>Medication would stop them.</i>
3519198 3520897 <i>Nothing that couldn't be fixed.</i>
3520996 3522655 Precision of language.
3522755 3525292 And Teacher said,<br />"That's right, Lily."
3525392 3527290 Very good.
3527390 3528649 Jonas.
3528749 3530966 Just in time for Feelings.
3531066 3532765 - Lily was telling us how she...<br />- Where's Gabe?
3532865 3535162 Uncertain was returned<br />to the Nurturing Center.
3535262 3536361 What happened?
3536461 3538609 Well, he failed his Test of Maturity.
3538779 3539758 Again.
3539858 3541396 I couldn't ask for another extension,
3541496 3543837 so I'll have to Release<br />him to Elsewhere.
3544333 3545352 Release him?
3545452 3548031 Well, we certainly gave it<br />our best try, didn't we?
3549568 3550986 But he's family.
3551086 3553424 Precision of language, please.
3553524 3555182 [FATHER] Sit down.
3555282 3557270 Eat with us.
3559478 3561740 I just need to rest for a while.
3573983 3575442 <i>[JONAS] I hadn't been wrong.</i>
3575542 3577160 <i>This was wrong.</i>
3577260 3579278 <i>They hadn't eliminated murder.</i>
3579378 3581156 <i>They'd brought it home.</i>
3581256 3584040 <i>They just called it<br />by a different name.</i>
3590567 3593953 <i>Father, he didn't know any better.</i>
3595802 3597631 <i>I did.</i>
3615382 3618007 [TIRES SCRAPING]
3618179 3620317 Jonas, what are you doing?<br />It's against the rules
3620417 3621915 to leave your community this late.
3622015 3624313 Asher, there's something<br />I have to do that is right,
3624413 3625592 but is sort of against the rules.
3625692 3629428 If it's the right thing to do,<br />how can it be against the rules?
3629528 3630667 There are things that I've learned
3630767 3632105 that you don't know<br />that you can't know,
3632205 3633504 - not because it's your fault...<br />- Jonas,
3633604 3634942 you need to go back<br />to your family unit.
3635042 3636701 But that's the point.
3636801 3639338 It isn't my family,<br />and neither is yours.
3639438 3640777 - Asher, I got to go.<br />- Jonas, listen.
3640876 3642695 - Get out of my way.<br />- Jonas, stop!
3642795 3644976 [GRUNTING]
3668569 3670353 Giver!
3671006 3673064 Giver, wake up.
3673164 3675022 I'd have to be sleeping to wake up.
3675122 3677260 Something can be done.<br />Something can be done.
3677360 3678379 What are you proposing?
3678479 3680976 All the memories back and back<br />and back can be returned.
3681076 3682255 I need to leave the Community.
3682355 3683853 I need to find the<br />Boundary of Memory.
3683953 3684932 And then?
3685032 3686171 And then cross it.
3686271 3687969 - No more discussions.<br />- Slowly.
3688069 3689048 Gabe is in danger.
3689148 3690807 - Slowly.<br />- I can't wait any more.
3690906 3692894 Something must be done.
3695102 3697480 If you had that map, then why<br />didn't you try to leave?
3697580 3701165 I was waiting for someone like you.
3701336 3703154 You are the reason we have a chance.
3703254 3707350 So, the plan will be for you<br />to go and for me to stay.
3707450 3709677 If you did cross this Boundary,
3710247 3711785 [SIGHS] and if the<br />memories were set free,
3711885 3715422 all of the pain that you felt,<br />all the confusion, the chaos,
3715522 3716701 it would all return.
3716800 3719619 - So you'd stay to help them?<br />- Yes.
3721076 3723099 And for my daughter.
3723234 3725052 It's what she would've wanted.
3725152 3726411 Your daughter?
3726511 3728249 Rosemary.
3728349 3729568 Now, your friend.
3729668 3731925 If he truly saw the<br />Triangle of Rocks...
3732025 3735605 Bring up Jonas's activity<br />for the past year as well.
3736221 3738798 So Asher came directly to you?
3738898 3739877 Yes.
3739977 3742675 What was Jonas's disposition<br />at evening meal?
3742774 3744353 Dissatisfied.
3744453 3745472 Anxious.
3745572 3746591 Indignant.
3746691 3749188 Set up a communication with<br />the Receiver of Memory.

3756840 3759817 [GIVER] If you go,<br />head towards the Triangle,
3759917 3761736 away from the other Communities.
