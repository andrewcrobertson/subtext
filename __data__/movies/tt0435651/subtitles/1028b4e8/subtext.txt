77840 79540 <i>I don't have a last name.</i>

88800 91985 <i>Tomorrow we'd be assigned<br />our jobs, our purpose.</i>
92840 95149 <i>It seemed everyone<br />knew theirs already.</i>
95800 97461 <i>Not me.</i>
97600 99829 <i>I was lost.</i>
100520 102829 <i>I always felt like I saw things</i>

118360 120430 <i>I never said anything.</i>
120760 122705 <i>I didn't want to be different.</i>
123320 124867 <i>Who would?</i>
125160 126620 - [BELL DINGING]<br />- Jonas.
126720 127820 I apologize, we're late.
127920 130180 I got Asher to come say<br />goodbye to Teacher.

140040 141780 <i>she was the girl who<br />made everyone smile.</i>
141880 142860 Take that back!
142960 144460 Whoever is listening, please, please,
144560 146980 do not make me Vice Chancellor<br />of Waste Management!
147080 148060 Please!
148160 149460 <i>[JONAS] We lived in a world</i>
149560 151460 <i>where differences weren't allowed.</i>
151560 153260 <i>There was no "popular."</i>
153360 154620 <i>No fame.</i>
154720 156984 <i>No losers and no winners.</i>
157160 158980 <i>Our Elders had eliminated all of that</i>

178920 181024 <i>I'll let you decide.</i>
182320 184340 [FIONA]<br />I'm going to miss volunteering here.
184440 186460 [ASHER] Oh, no. If ever<br />there was a person born
186560 189910 - to work at the Nurturing Center...<br />- I could be surprised, right?
190040 191220 Jonas, if you had to guess,
191320 193788 of all the positions the<br />elders picked for me?
195560 196700 Nurturing Center.
196800 198100 [CLUNKING]
198200 201146 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Welcome to the Nurturing Center.</i>
203040 205383 [BABIES FUSSING, CRYING]
208520 210300 I got this. I got this.
210400 212982 - Think heavy. Think heavy.<br />- Come on, come on.
215200 216340 [FIONA] We win!
216440 218060 Aren't you my chubby champion?
218160 219940 - Which one was heavier?<br />- [FIONA] Mine.
220040 221060 Asher?
221160 222500 [BABIES CRYING]
222600 224860 Father, I think Fiona put<br />her finger on the scale.
224960 226100 I did not.
226200 228065 [BABY CRYING]
229200 231100 [CRYING CONTINUES]
231200 234431 Aw, this little guy didn't<br />qualify for tomorrow's ceremony.
235080 237580 [FATHER] He's just not strong enough<br />to be assigned to a family yet.
237680 238940 [CRYING]
239040 241060 He looks so unhappy.
241160 243822 - [CRYING CONTINUES]<br />- Hey...
244520 246590 It's okay, Jonas, you can open it.
250560 252700 Yeah, it's Jonas.
252800 254665 Here, let me.
255120 257020 [FIONA]<br />Oh, There you go. There you go.
257120 258140 [BABY QUIETING]
258240 260020 - [WHISPERING] It's okay.<br />- Some people have it, huh?
260120 261260 Well, that's just not fair.
261360 263021 Be strong, Gabriel.
263640 265180 You looked at his name?
265280 266660 Isn't that against the rules?
266760 268500 Yeah, it, it is.
269360 271783 I just thought having a<br />name might help him grow.
272120 274543 So I whisper it to him<br />when no one can hear.
275440 277305 Sometimes I call him Gabe.
278480 279780 [FATHER]<br />But he's usually so restless,
279880 282109 I, I'm not even sure he can hear me.
282440 283420 You okay?
283520 285100 Huh? Yeah.
285200 286180 I'm fine.
286280 287820 So the old man turns<br />to the Elder and says,
287920 289220 "Do you know who I am?"
289320 291340 And the Elder says,<br />"Sir, I know you're old,
291440 293100 but that is no excuse<br />for being prideful."
293200 296020 And then the old man says,<br />"No, really, I'm asking.
296120 298660 - Who am I?"<br />- [JONAS AND ASHER LAUGHING]
298760 300460 [FIONA] I don't get it.
300560 302860 [ASHER] "Who am I?" like,<br />like he forgot who he was.
302960 303940 [ELECTRONIC CHIMING]
304040 305420 Okay, but wouldn't the joke be better
305520 307620 - if the old man says...<br />- [ASHER AND JONAS] Okay, one...
307720 309300 - What?<br />- ...two...
309400 310900 - ...three!<br />- [BOTH GRUNTING]
311000 312740 - [BOTH LAUGHING]<br />- [FIONA GROANS]
312840 314020 Aren't we graduates now?
314120 315180 [ASHER] You do this every time!
315280 316300 - Come on!<br />- Okay!
316400 318220 One, two, three! [SHRIEKS]
318320 319420 [LAUGHING]
319520 320580 [ASHER] There you go.
320680 322750 [LAUGHING]
323600 326148 So, I guess this is it.
326520 327860 The last night of our childhood.
327960 329900 I guess everything is<br />gonna be different.
330000 330980 No.
331080 333860 Tomorrow the only thing<br />that changes is what we do.
333960 335460 It doesn't change who we are.
335560 336860 Quick question: Who are we?
336960 337940 Friends.
338040 339380 - [ASHER] Friends forever.<br />- [FIONA] Yes.
339480 341300 Even when you're both<br />assigned to be Birth Mothers.
341400 342460 [JONAS] Hey!
342560 344580 Well, I guess we'll<br />find out tomorrow, huh?
344680 346220 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Citizens are reminded</i>
346320 349580 <i>that evening recreation<br />will end in 30 minutes.</i>
349680 351386 <i>Thank you.</i>
351920 354340 [MOTHER] Well, he did<br />need to be rehabilitated.
354440 357140 And I know he was Lily's Teacher,<br />but what was I supposed to do?
357240 358901 - [FATHER] Hmm.
359600 361147 [MOTHER] I feel...
362480 363460 disappointment.
363560 364820 What was the Elders' decision?
364920 366180 Released to Elsewhere.
366280 368100 Can I be "Released to<br />Elsewhere," Mother?
368200 369620 Even just for one day?
369720 372143 No, you're too young, Lily Billy.
374960 377542 Jonas, your turn for Feelings.
379680 382387 Well, I guess I'm sort of...
383360 385021 terrified.
385440 387060 Precision of language.
387160 389424 I mean anxious.
390640 391780 When you were about to graduate,
391880 395180 did you ever feel like there<br />was no position meant for you?
395280 397740 They've been watching since<br />you were a Newchild.
397840 399944 The Elders are never wrong.
402680 404625 [FATHER] You'll find your place.

1204680 1209746 Simply stated, there is no snow<br />because of climate control.

1941760 1943750 Don't be gullible.
1949920 1951180 Another trick?
1951280 1953225 Actually, no.
1955640 1958700 It's some kind of map.
1958800 1959900 The Triangle of Rocks!
1960000 1962582 Hey, that's real,<br />my friend Asher saw it.
1962840 1964785 Look at all these towers.
1964920 1965940 What were they for?
1966040 1968420 How did your friend see<br />the Triangle of Rocks?
1968520 1971500 He's a pilot. He told me he saw it.
1972040 1973541 What's past there?
1976400 1978709 A mystery.
1978960 1980740 [JONAS] "Boundary of Memory"?<br />Is that what they built
1980840 1983220 so the memories would only<br />stay within you and me?
1983320 1984420 Let's move on.
1984520 1985700 Wait.
1985800 1988020 That boundary is meant<br />to keep memories in.
1988120 1990031 So if a Receiver crosses it,
1990240 1992583 does that mean the<br />memories get set free?
1993400 1994500 Perhaps.
1994600 1997020 Perhaps if you or I crossed it,
1997120 1999861 everyone could feel<br />those memories again.
2000640 2003142 So, what am I seeing today?
2004360 2006544 Nothing.
2007600 2010671 - [WHIRRING, CLACKING]<br />- You're seeing nothing today.
2017160 2019708 We've already covered<br />"seeing beyond."
2020640 2023460 There is also such a thing<br />as "hearing beyond."
2023560 2025100 A table?
2025200 2027828 All the food would<br />slide to the floor.
2030360 2033380 Now, don't judge me. [CHUCKLES]
2033480 2035903 I'm not very good,
2036200 2039180 even though I had<br />a very good Teacher.

2075840 2077990 Just like music,
2078280 2081147 there's something else you<br />can't see with your eyes.
2081600 2085547 Something that lives deep inside you.
2085720 2090464 Something those morning<br />injections take away.
2090760 2093500 But I thought the injections<br />are for our health.
2093600 2095740 No, they remove something.
2095840 2097466 What?
2097920 2099300 Emotions.
2099400 2101660 [TEMPO INCREASES]
2101760 2103705 You mean like feelings?
2105120 2107980 Feelings are just fleeting.
2108080 2109706 On the surface.
2110560 2112500 But emotions,
2112600 2115460 they're very deep, primal.
2115560 2117471 They linger.
2118880 2120711 Now, Jonas...
2121720 2125380 you might not understand where<br />you are or what's happening,
2125480 2128221 but don't think about<br />what you're seeing.
2128680 2130625 Listen.
2132280 2135465 Listen to what's calling from inside.

2240680 2241820 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE] Injected.</i>
2241920 2243020 Fine.
2243120 2245100 <i>I am concerned about the Receiver.</i>
2245200 2246700 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE] Injected.</i>
2246800 2248860 <i>Many years ago,<br />there was an incident.</i>
2248960 2250580 What kind of incident?
2250680 2256140 <i>Living alone in a building on<br />the Edge can isolate a person.</i>
2256240 2260506 <i>I'm concerned that the<br />Receiver is becoming reckless.</i>
2260920 2263460 <i>Are you being properly prepared?</i>
2263560 2264540 I think so.
2264640 2266949 <i>You're focused?</i>
2267680 2271260 <i>Perhaps you're spending too much time<br />with friends from your childhood.</i>
2271360 2272340 I'm focused.
2272440 2275700 <i>Jonas, what do you and<br />the Receiver actually do?</i>
2275800 2277420 My rules say I'm not<br />allowed to share.
2277520 2279465 She is the Chief Elder.
2279920 2282184 Jonas, she only wants to help.
2282600 2284511 You're right.
2285360 2288022 But you can't tell the<br />Receiver I told you.
2288960 2290340 <i>You have my word.</i>
2290440 2294300 We sit in chairs and<br />don't talk all day long.
2294400 2297028 And then when time is up,<br />I come back here,
2297240 2300061 and in the morning,<br />I do it all again.
2302040 2304463 I apologize, but I'm late.
2305040 2307508 <i>Your apology is accepted.</i>

2317000 2320749 I'm surprised you're not<br />more worried about him.
2322200 2326102 Were he my responsibility,<br />I would be.
2326520 2329300 <i>[JONAS] We'd been told the<br />Chief Elder knew everything.</i>

2370840 2373380 <i>Have faith, the Giver told me.</i>
2373480 2376900 <i>He said faith,<br />that was seeing beyond.</i>
2377000 2380700 <i>He compared it to the wind,<br />something felt but not seen.</i>
2380800 2383060 Don't accept... [CHUCKLES]
2383160 2385300 What is the truth just because
2385400 2387060 it's coming from someone you respect.
2387160 2388740 [JONAS] I feel completely stupid.
2388840 2390260 - I have a weird feeling.<br />- Weird?
2390360 2392510 - It tingles in your hands.<br />- Yes.
2392680 2395467 Memories are not just about the past,
2395680 2398023 they determine our future.
2398200 2400260 You can change things.
2400360 2402749 You can make things better.
2406280 2408464 <i>[JONAS] It was life.</i>
2408800 2411587 <i>It just seemed more complete.</i>

2435320 2437780 I can't prepare you for<br />what's going to happen...
2437880 2439340 You don't need to warn<br />me every single time.
2439440 2441780 No, Jonas, you don't understand.
2441880 2443420 There was tremendous cruelty.

2612880 2614540 and what you had for dinner.
2614640 2616585 [CHUCKLES]

2641400 2643026 Yes.
2643680 2646308 We don't have that any more.
2647360 2649340 What do you mean by "that"?
2649440 2654423 Well, I'm talking about what<br />you feel for someone else.

2659000 2661060 You can't make it go away.

2662280 2664191 Love.
2665360 2668545 It's called love.

2681400 2683260 [CHUCKLES] What's new with you?
2683360 2685669 What's ever new?
2689360 2691100 Why are you being weird?
2691200 2692980 I'm not.

2717280 2718860 - [GABRIEL CRYING]<br />- I got him, Lily.
2718960 2720340 Jonas used a word so antiquated
2720440 2722820 that it no longer<br />has any application.
2722920 2724260 - Okay?<br />- Okay.
2724360 2728501 If you asked, "Do you enjoy me?"<br />the answer is certainly yes.
2728960 2732191 Or do Mother and I take pride<br />in your accomplishments?
2732640 2734220 Well, of course we do.

2940120 2942540 <i>[JONAS]<br />I didn't ever want to go back.</i>
2942640 2946587 <i>I didn't want the wisdom,<br />didn't want the pain.</i>

2952800 2955348 <i>Back then, we'd played war.</i>

2958040 2960460 <i>The Elders understood that.</i>

2988080 2990264 [FIONA] Hey, what's wrong?
2990680 2992020 Nothing.
2992120 2993860 I know you.
2993960 2995100 You do, do you?
2995200 2996701 Yes.
2997280 2998540 What do you think would happen
2998640 3000585 if you skipped your<br />morning injection?
3001000 3002300 If you skipped it.
3002400 3004860 Then the sensor would blink and<br />remind me that I forgot it.
3004960 3006220 No, I don't mean if you forgot.
3006320 3008900 I mean, what do you think<br />would happen if you chose
3009000 3011100 not to be injected?
3011200 3012940 Jonas, I thought something was wrong.
3013040 3014580 There is something wrong.
3014680 3016180 Everything is wrong.
3016280 3017500 I quit.
3017600 3019829 Fiona, I'm done being the Receiver.
3020120 3021780 Tomorrow morning,<br />skip your injection.
3021880 3022860 What? You quit?
3022960 3024780 Prick your finger and put<br />a little blood on this apple.
3024880 3025900 No, you can't quit.
3026000 3027820 If you quit your position,<br />you get sent to Elsewhere.
3027920 3029900 When you leave in the morning,<br />put the apple over the sensor.
3030000 3031620 It'll find your blood and<br />think it's your hand.
3031720 3032980 Stop, you're scaring me.
3033080 3035420 Fiona, I need you to do this.<br />I need you to feel what I know it's...
3035520 3037226 Jonas.
3037520 3038940 An apple wouldn't even work.
3039040 3042862 I've been doing it for months,<br />and it's worked every single time.
3043920 3045060 Don't quit.
3045160 3046866 You can't leave.
3049040 3052146 I don't think I can go<br />back to that place.
3056120 3058110 You will if you want me to do this.
3058280 3060384 Okay. Fine.
3061480 3064267 But tomorrow after work,<br />meet me in the triangle.

3119520 3121385 Who are you?

3124040 3125020 - Me?<br />- [GIVER] Me?
3125120 3126100 [ROSEMARY] Yeah.
3126200 3128384 I want to teach you.
3135480 3137345 You've come back.
3137560 3138860 Where did you learn that?
3138960 3140500 From the memory you gave me.
3140600 3142260 [GIVER] And you can just play it?
3142360 3144021 Mm-hmm.
3144280 3145260 That's beautiful.
3145360 3146340 - [JONAS] Who's that?<br />- Thanks.
3146440 3150069 - This is Rosemary.<br />- I'll show you.
3150280 3152380 The previous Receiver.
3152480 3155221 - See?<br />- She's the one they all talk about.
3155960 3158460 [HUMMING TO MUSIC]
3158560 3160700 She no longer exists.
3160800 3161980 Remember? [CONTINUES HUMMING]
3162080 3164340 Except here.
3164440 3166780 And in my memories.
3166880 3170463 [HUMMING]
3170960 3173820 She was in training<br />only two short months.
3173920 3177420 ♪ Watch how my fingers move ♪
3177520 3179465 And like you,
3180040 3182508 she wanted to experience,
3183040 3184860 well, everything.
3184960 3187820 I only gave her pleasant,<br />beautiful memories.
3187920 3189620 Three, four...
3189720 3191060 She fought me.
3191160 3192460 - Don't protect me.<br />- No!
3192560 3195220 Don't show me a map and then<br />not give me all the memories.
3195320 3198260 - I thought we were gonna help.<br />- We will, but we must move slow.
3198360 3200225 Show it to me.
3200440 3202465 You gave her war?
3205320 3208630 [GIVER]<br />I gave her the memory of a child...
3209200 3212590 A child taken from her mother.
3212960 3215349 I gave her loss.
3215920 3217540 Too soon.
3217640 3220347 You're gonna get the hang of this.
3220680 3222860 The light went from her eyes.
3222960 3224980 [HUMMING]
3225080 3228663 The next morning, without telling me,
3228800 3232668 she went to the Chief Elder<br />and asked to be Released.
3234440 3235940 So she was Released?
3236040 3238110 And now lives in Elsewhere?
3240960 3242180 [DEVICE CHIMES]
3242280 3243340 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE] Yes, Receiver?</i>

3254680 3255940 [JONAS] More twins. Great.
3256040 3258349 - Watch.<br />- [FATHER] Oh, good.
3259120 3261460 For a moment, I thought<br />they'd be exactly the same.
3261560 3262540 Here we go.
3262640 3264180 Then we'd have a problem.
3264280 3266100 [SOFTLY] Okay, okay.
3266200 3267900 Thank you, Dinah.
3268000 3270580 - Yes, yes, yes, yes.<br />- And you,

3303360 3305340 Oh, I know it hurts, I know.
3305440 3307780 I know, I know.
3307880 3310260 But I have to use a vein,<br />and the ones in your arms
3310360 3312100 are too teeny weenie.
3312200 3314300 Almost, almost...
3314400 3315420 Done.
3315520 3317988 That wasn't so bad now, was it?
3324880 3326300 That's death.
3326400 3327780 He doesn't know what he's doing.
3327880 3330860 Doesn't know what he's doing?
3331680 3332660 He killed him.
3332760 3334910 But he doesn't know what it means.
3335480 3337020 Just like you didn't.
3337120 3339349 Neither did Rosemary.
3339520 3341340 How can he not see the<br />baby isn't moving?
3341440 3343140 Doesn't that tell him<br />something is wrong?
3343240 3345780 The young and the old are killed.
3345880 3347220 You're friend, Fiona,
3347320 3349820 she will soon be trained<br />to Release as well.
3349920 3351820 That's a lie.
3351920 3353300 She'd never do that.
3353400 3354380 If Fiona understood...
3354480 3357020 We are the only ones<br />who understand it.
3357120 3358420 Then it's our fault.
3358520 3360180 You and me and all the Receivers
3360280 3362260 back and back and back<br />and back and back.
3362360 3364100 There has to be a way to show them,
3364200 3367180 to give them the memories<br />so they can understand.
3367280 3370386 - Yes.<br />- Because if you can't feel,
3371000 3372220 what's the point?
3372320 3374310 But what can you do?
3382000 3383620 <i>[ELECTRONIC VOICE]<br />Citizens are reminded</i>
3383720 3387260 <i>that evening recreation<br />will end in 30 minutes.</i>
3387360 3389305 <i>Thank you.</i>
3412000 3412980 Did it work?
3413080 3414740 I don't know how long it<br />takes for the injections
3414840 3416420 to leave you, whether a<br />day was long enough or...
3416520 3418943 Why did I do this, Jonas?
3419160 3421980 On the walk here, I was thinking<br />of how I would scold you.
3422080 3424540 How I would say,<br />"Oh, it's fine for you
3424640 3426820 to break the rules<br />because you're chosen."
3426920 3431344 When I thought about<br />telling you, I just, I...
3431760 3433460 I began to think about you.
3433560 3435391 [GASPS SOFTLY]
3438000 3439911 Is this okay?
3443680 3445989 Do you feel anything?
3447240 3448580 [FIONA] It feels like...
3448680 3449740 [JONAS] Fiona,
3449840 3451380 - what do you feel?<br />- I don't know.
3451480 3454460 I don't have the<br />words to describe it.
3454560 3455660 Warm?
3455760 3457100 Does it feel warm?
3457200 3458260 Warm?
3458360 3460783 Does it feel nice?
3467960 3469460 [GASPS] No, um...
3469560 3470540 I, I'm on night shift.
3470640 3471860 I need to...
3471960 3473660 I don't feel right, Jonas.
3473760 3475260 I need to go and get my injection.
3475360 3477703 I need to go to work.
3488200 3489580 What was that?
3489680 3491540 Fiona, there is more.
3491640 3493790 So much more.
3506200 3508100 <i>[JONAS] I remembered it now.</i>
3508200 3510060 <i>I had dreamed of her.</i>
3510160 3512264 <i>When I was younger.</i>
3512680 3514670 <i>I told my parents.</i>
3514800 3517380 <i>"It was the Stirrings they said.</i>
3517480 3519220 <i>Everyone had them.</i>
3519320 3521620 <i>Medication would stop them.</i>

3523520 3525180 Precision of language.
3525280 3527820 And Teacher said,<br />"That's right, Lily."
3527920 3529820 Very good.
3529920 3531180 Jonas.
3531280 3533500 Just in time for Feelings.
3533600 3535300 - Lily was telling us how she...<br />- Where's Gabe?
3535400 3537700 Uncertain was returned<br />to the Nurturing Center.
3537800 3538900 What happened?
3539000 3541150 Well, he failed his Test of Maturity.
3541320 3542300 Again.
3542400 3543940 I couldn't ask for another extension,
3544040 3546383 so I'll have to Release<br />him to Elsewhere.
3546880 3547900 Release him?
3548000 3550582 Well, we certainly gave it<br />our best try, didn't we?
3552120 3553540 But he's family.
3553640 3555980 Precision of language, please.
3556080 3557740 [FATHER] Sit down.
3557840 3559830 Eat with us.
3562040 3564304 I just need to rest for a while.
3576560 3578020 <i>[JONAS] I hadn't been wrong.</i>
3578120 3579740 <i>This was wrong.</i>
3579840 3581860 <i>They hadn't eliminated murder.</i>
3581960 3583740 <i>They'd brought it home.</i>

3598400 3600231 <i>I did.</i>
3618000 3620628 [TIRES SCRAPING]
3620800 3622940 Jonas, what are you doing?<br />It's against the rules
3623040 3624540 to leave your community this late.
3624640 3626940 Asher, there's something<br />I have to do that is right,
3627040 3628220 but is sort of against the rules.
3628320 3632060 If it's the right thing to do,<br />how can it be against the rules?
3632160 3633300 There are things that I've learned
3633400 3634740 that you don't know<br />that you can't know,
3634840 3636140 - not because it's your fault...<br />- Jonas,
3636240 3637580 you need to go back<br />to your family unit.
3637680 3639340 But that's the point.
3639440 3641980 It isn't my family,<br />and neither is yours.
3642080 3643420 - Asher, I got to go.<br />- Jonas, listen.
3643520 3645340 - Get out of my way.<br />- Jonas, stop!

3673680 3675740 Giver, wake up.
3675840 3677700 I'd have to be sleeping to wake up.
3677800 3679940 Something can be done.<br />Something can be done.
3680040 3681060 What are you proposing?
3681160 3683660 All the memories back and back<br />and back can be returned.
3683760 3684940 I need to leave the Community.
3685040 3686540 I need to find the<br />Boundary of Memory.
3686640 3687620 And then?
3687720 3688860 And then cross it.
3688960 3690660 - No more discussions.<br />- Slowly.
3690760 3691740 Gabe is in danger.
3691840 3693500 - Slowly.<br />- I can't wait any more.
3693600 3695590 Something must be done.
3697800 3700180 If you had that map, then why<br />didn't you try to leave?
3700280 3703869 I was waiting for someone like you.
3704040 3705860 You are the reason we have a chance.
3705960 3710060 So, the plan will be for you<br />to go and for me to stay.
3710160 3712389 If you did cross this Boundary,
3712960 3714500 [SIGHS] and if the<br />memories were set free,
3714600 3718140 all of the pain that you felt,<br />all the confusion, the chaos,
3718240 3719420 it would all return.
3719520 3722341 - So you'd stay to help them?<br />- Yes.
3723800 3725825 And for my daughter.
3725960 3727780 It's what she would've wanted.
3727880 3729140 Your daughter?
3729240 3730980 Rosemary.
3731080 3732300 Now, your friend.
3732400 3734660 If he truly saw the<br />Triangle of Rocks...
3734760 3738343 Bring up Jonas's activity<br />for the past year as well.
3738960 3741540 So Asher came directly to you?
3741640 3742620 Yes.
3742720 3745420 What was Jonas's disposition<br />at evening meal?
3745520 3747100 Dissatisfied.
3747200 3748220 Anxious.
3748320 3749340 Indignant.
3749440 3751940 Set up a communication with<br />the Receiver of Memory.

5122000 5124070 Excuse me for one second, Fiona.
