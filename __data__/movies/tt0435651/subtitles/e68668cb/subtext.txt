52164 56042 After the ruins, we started over.
56132 58370 Creating a new society.
58571 60951 One of true a quality.
61210 64258 Rules were the building blocks of that qualities.
64349 67788 We learned them as a new children.<br />Rules like:
67878 71994 "Use precise language"; "Wear your assigned clothing ";
72084 74675 - "Take your morning medication." - Injected.
74765 79174 "Obey the curfew" "Never lie."
82636 87352 (The Giver)
87442 92966 My name is Jonas. I don't have a last name, none of us did.
93399 97081 That day, the day before graduation,
97271 99968 I admitted, I was scared.
100176 103850 Tomorrow we'd be assigned our jobs. Our purpose.
104158 106722 Seemed everyone knew theirs already.
106849 110739 Not me. I was last.
111678 114545 I always felt that I saw things ...
114635 116545 Differently.
116636 119167 Saw things other people didn't.
129693 134132 I never said anything. I didn't want to be different.
134471 136257 Who would?
136820 138234 Jonas!
138325 141839 I apologize, we're late, like God actually came to say goodbye to the teacher.
141929 143440 I accept your apology.
143530 147087 Asher and Fiona; we've been friends our whole life.
147177 149631 Asher was the boy who made everyone laugh.
149721 151721 Fiona... well.
151812 154250 She was the girl who made everybody smile.
154340 160023 If we're listening: please, please! Do not make me advise Jeff where Matt's been. Please.
160044 162898 We lived in a world where differences were not allowed.
162988 168544 There was no "Popular", no "Fame", no "Looser" and no "Winners".
168634 173125 Our Elders eliminated all of that, so that there is no conflict between us.
173215 177697 Fear, pain, envy, hate ...
177787 180263 There were words, so much as sounds.
180353 183635 Their echoes were gone to the other side of history.
185955 189545 I wonder if I should apologize for what I did.
190059 192240 I let you decide.
193630 195850 I'm going to miss volunteering here.
195909 199482 Oh No! If ever there is a person boring to work in a Nurturing Center.
199510 201392 I could be surprise, right?
201500 205515 Jonas, if you had to guess, of all positions the Elders picked for me ...
206652 208547 Nurturing Center.
209468 212629 Welcome to the Nurturing Center.
219657 224239 -I got this. I got this. Think Heaven<br />-Come on. Come on.<br />-Think Heaven.
226291 229775 We win! Or You might be the champion!
229796 231306 - Which one is the heavier? - Mine.
231327 232561 Asher!
233895 237757 - I rather think Fiona put her finger on the scale! - I did not!
242420 246216 Oh, this Little guy didn't qualify for tomorrow's ceremony.
246307 249871 It's just not strong enough to be assigned to a family here.
250467 252277 He looks so unhappy ...
255656 258031 It's okay Jonas, you can open it.
261643 264015 Oohh. Hey! It's Jonas.
264075 265955 Here Let me.
266677 270168 There you go, there you go...
270216 272711 - Some people laugh at it. Humm<br />- Laugh is not fair!
272732 274409 Be strong, Gabriel!
274881 278049 Dad, You looked at his name? Is not it against the rules?
278101 279996 Yeah, It is ...
280459 283368 I just thought having a name would help him grow.
283458 286311 I whispered to him so no one can hear.
286669 289572 Sometimes I say "Gabe".
289631 293423 It's usually anxious, I thought that if I hear ...
293755 295755 - Are you okay? - Humm ..
295789 297539 Yeah, I'm fine.
297686 300749 So The old man turns to Elder and says, "Do You know who I am"?
300776 304544 And the Elder says, "Sir, I know you're old, but that is not the excuse for being proudful."
304569 308600 Then the old man says, "No, really, I am asking: who am I"?
310007 311625 I don't get it ...
311907 314850 "Who am I" Like he forgot who he was.
315280 318068 Ok, but  better if old joke said ...
318088 320440 So: one ... two ...
320541 321774 Three!
324183 327719 - Aren't we graduates now? - We do it every time; come on!
327739 329435 One, two, three ...!
330557 332025 There you go...
334814 339483 So ... I guess this is it. Last night of our childhood.
339503 341558 I guess everything is gonna be different.
341579 345121 No; tomorrow, the only thing that changes is what we do.
345141 346926 Does not change what we are.
346947 349319 - Good question. Who are we? - Friends.
349340 350838 - Friends forever. - Yes.
350858 353236 Even when you both designed be birth mothers.
353793 355972 I guess, we'll find out tomorrow, right?
355992 361245 Citizens are reminded that the evening creation will ending in 13 minutes.
361265 362827 Thank you.
363127 365528 Well did need to be rehabilitated.
365579 368978 I know he was Lily's teacher, but what was I supposed to do?
370666 372368 I feel ...
373438 374738 disappointment.
374758 377643 - What was Elders' decision? - Released to elsewhere.
377664 381010 Can I be released elsewhere, Mother? even just for one day ...?
381030 383290 No you are too young, Lily-billy.
385959 389290 Jonas - your turn for feelings.
390791 393780 Well, I guess some sort of...
394306 395843 Terrified.
396432 398250 Precision of language.
398363 400835 I mean anxious.
401836 404514 When you are about to graduate... you, did you ever feel ...
404535 406509 that there was no position meant for you?
406530 410980 - They have been watching you since you were even a child.<br />- The Elders are never wrong.
413731 415648 you will find your place.
418911 423152 Welcome, citizens, to the annual ceremony of advancement.
423172 425494 Please, stand-by for a transmission.
428662 432351 - Good Morning, Community. - Good morning, Chief Elder...
432371 435101 I apologize for my remote attendance.
435121 437219 We accept your apology.
437239 440775 I can't be at every ceremony - in person.
441207 445359 But here's the secret: you are my favourite community.
446172 451419 However, because we do not lie, I readily admit that I said that to every community.
453182 454816 Beginnings ...
454911 460177 From disorder and chaos, from great suffering, great pain ...
460628 465174 from confusion, from envy and hatred...

696775 700505 Jonas posses all four attributes.
700525 705789 Intelligence, integrity, courage and one I name, but ...
705809 709560 I can not describe: the capacity to see beyond.
709580 713707 But I must warn you: your training involves pain.
713727 717281 Pain far beyond anything we known.
717382 719634 Are you strong enough?

727366 732766 Jonas, you have been selected as our next Receiver of memories.

791885 795468 Receiver of memory. Five rules.
795850 800581 One: Report directly to the receiver of memory for training.
800851 804627 After training, return immediately to your dwelling.
805597 811438 Two, From this moment, you are exempt from all rules governing rudeness.
811595 813769 You may ask any questions.
813851 818840 Three, beside from your daily injection, you may not recieve other medicines.
818891 820837 Especially those for pain.
820885 824410 Inject-at. S752.
824529 829547 Four, you may not discuss your training with anyone.
830766 832460 Ever.
832480 835217 - Your look so important ... - I don't know  ...?
835237 838765 - Stick out? - Oh Yeah, there is only one receiver of memory.
838786 840095 Two.
840115 843588 What have they said? That "You have the capacity to see beyond"?
843608 845066 The ...
845129 847509 Can't wait to hear every single detail!
847622 851011 Five: You may lie.
856623 860844 Asher and I, we used to dare each other to get closed to his place.
860957 863807 It was built right on the edge.
864345 866915 We all heard of people getting lost on edge.
866929 868929 Never to be seen again.
869055 871320 And yet ... here I was.
871932 875074 Being told that I have to get close to it every day.
875094 877223 For the rest of my life.
888508 890194 Welcome.
891825 893729 Uhmm, Hi. I'm Jonas ...
893749 895972 Please raise at the sensor.
897741 900848 Welcome, Receiver of Memories.
946272 948220 They're called Books
948390 950015 Your Books.
950085 952327 - Uhm My name is...<br />- I know who you are.
952402 955042 Of course; I apologize.
957968 959781 "I apologized" ...?
960247 961935 Stop saying that.
963203 966911 "I apologized" ... don't apologize to me.
966988 969836 Never again; not here.
971612 975287 We haven't time to "apologize".
975307 979087 That's an automatic pleasantry. It does not mean anything.
979107 982068 I apologise... I'm sorry. I mean ...
982450 985435 We are here for only one purpose.
986536 988403 Simply stated...
988478 991172 Although the words are really simple at all ...
991479 995594 I'll transmit you all the memories that hold within me.
995650 997741 Memories of the past.
997867 1000910 I'd be very interested to learn about your life.
1000930 1002812 No, no. Not..
1003425 1005144 my life.
1005626 1008261 You'll learn the secret history of the world!
1008343 1012068 Before me, before you, the generations back n back n back.
1012574 1015124 When things were different: when there is more.
1015151 1016611 "more"...?
1016792 1018620 Get ... Chair.
1018846 1023310 You see, no one in our community has any memory of the past.
1023330 1025034 Only me.
1025141 1029579 When Elders need a guide beyond there experience,
1029599 1032567 I provide wisdom; that is now your role.
1032587 1036884 to Provide guidance in the present, using the memories of the past.
1036904 1038700 Come closer.
1043086 1044893 Where to begin ...?
1046969 1048865 Come closer.
1051782 1053303 Closer.
1057047 1062025 There is no way for me to prepare you for what i'm going to do now.
1062154 1064627 It's gonna take comfort to knowing...
1065134 1068036 You're completely helpless.
1078010 1082080 If any of this proof too much for you, tell me immediately.
1082100 1083869 I just have...
1168468 1172696 Silent Night ...
1172778 1177028 Holy time ...
1177067 1178944 All sleep ...
1181620 1184006 That was ... That ...
1184369 1188458 - How that happened? - What you mean 'how'? It happened.
1188479 1190859 - But that's impossible! - And yet, it happened.
1191077 1192658 But ... why?
1192952 1194525 Why don't we have ...
1194639 1195888 That ...
1196663 1198725 Thing ...
1198794 1202990 Come on ... the memories gave you the words; not "thing" ...
1203010 1204918 - "sledge"! - Sledge.
1204938 1206225 And the...
1207957 1210136 - Snow. - Snow ...
1210368 1214952 -But My parents haven't been ...Did you ...? - No ... It's a distinct memory.
1215034 1216725 Simply stated...
1217013 1220245 There is no snow because of climate control.
1220802 1225782 But why all people do not know about this? What's so dangerous in the memory of a sledge?
1225802 1227685 What's so dangerous ...?
1229116 1231391 For sledge you need snow;
1231437 1235095 Snow is cold; cold destroys crops ...
1235226 1237629 which means farmers could not farm.
1237711 1241060 Unpredictable weather, the hills, the mountains ...
1241098 1243892 made it difficult to transport of food.
1244111 1247489 and we had hunger, starvation, famine ...
1247726 1251236 Everything is connected, everything is balance.
1251636 1253852 Where there is good, there is always bad.
1253872 1255694 - The two ... - Show me more!
1258794 1260737 Let's go for a walk.
1262988 1265705 A real one,with our legs.
1266175 1270052 at The bottom of hill ... I saw something.
1270166 1272080 Like a place.
1273352 1275148 - "Home". - Home. Yes.
1275169 1276639 "Home"? Like a dwelling?
1276660 1278231 - Mr. Receiver ... - Good morning!
1278252 1283734 No ... It's different. A dwelling is not a "home".
1284403 1286688 "Home" means more.
1288845 1292637 Your instructions said I can lie; Do you lie?
1292901 1297385 A, all the time! mostly for personal amusement.
1297823 1300054 But I won't lie to you.
1300243 1302846 How do I know that's not a lie?
1307447 1309676 There was someone else before me.
1310233 1312048 What happened to them?
1317354 1319016 One more question!
1319390 1322041 If I am now the receiver,what is that make you?
1322142 1325017 Well. That must make me...
1325243 1326789 The Giver.
1336142 1337643 So how was it?
1338425 1341147 - It was good. - What you do?
1342910 1345861 - We just talked. - What else?
1346936 1348513 That's It.
1348594 1350996 - You seem different. - How do you mean?
1351068 1355314 - I see him tomorrow. - He cancel them, no matter what I do.
1355695 1359048 - And you said that you look after it. - I know, I said.
1359087 1362151 - I apologize. -I accept your apology.
1362264 1364352 - Thank you, Dinah. - Thank you.
1368274 1371734 - Gabriel! - How did Jonas know the child's name?
1371802 1376131 - Jonas met Gabriel the other day. - It's so cute!
1376909 1380007 Would you like to issue me a warning, director of Justice ?
1380101 1383695 Just for a while, Mother; till little guy catch up us.
1383733 1386672 I think we all agree that you will sleep in my room.
1386998 1390400 - Only if the Elders says It's Okay.<br />- They will.
1390619 1391954 Yeah ...
1392324 1394832 Lily, give me a comfort object.
1395257 1397812 Come on, Lily; It's time for bed.
1398238 1400946 - Look at this...<br />- By, baby!
1401185 1404335 This is a mythical creature called "hippo."
1404409 1409902 And it's incredibly fast, because Its has two, three, four, five legs!
1411352 1412851 We had the same mark.
1412872 1414087 And it's very strong ...
1414107 1416866 They almost did not have to see his to know.
1416886 1418434 I felt that.
1418791 1422704 Felt that one day Gabriel will be chosen too.
1422749 1424588 ...hippo!
1425478 1426985 Yeah...!
1438816 1443366 - That's the pain I talked about.<br />- No ... Not even close.
1443461 1445607 - Did you... - How to face!
1446201 1449665 - Why was that thing alive ...?<br />- don't skip your head.
1449685 1452567 - Did you notice anything about them?<br />- Yes: It hurt.
1452588 1454747 No, any quality.
1457029 1458858 Well Maybe ...
1459303 1462376 I think I saw it in friend Fiona's hair.
1463833 1466207 My twist is yellow.
1466558 1469361 If you thought the slab special ...
1519799 1521222 It's ...
1523648 1525044 "Red"!
1525876 1528408 - Just like her hair ... - Yes.
1528759 1532323 There are red, green, blue ... Many different colours.
1532793 1535295 You'll see them all In time.
1535989 1540884 When our people have chose to ... to away with all of them...
1541166 1543869 Colour, race, religion ...
1544095 1545977 They created sameness.
1546077 1549129 If we were different, we could be envious ...
1549574 1552366 angry, resentful...
1552633 1554834 consumed of hatred.
1556116 1558001 we need sameness.
1558652 1561824 - Not You think?<br />- Oh, I completely agree!
1562743 1564298 And still ...
1565055 1566694 also...
1566901 1568689 It's beautiful.
1574345 1577325 We always said that Elsewhere is so far-away.
1578138 1579840 But it wasn't.
1580378 1582170 It was right there.
1583536 1585503 Close enough to touch.
1586497 1589471 Jonas, have you fallen...?
1589728 1593570 - Do you need immediate help?<br />- No, I.. I was just ...
1594433 1596274 What's going on with you?
1596574 1598191 Nothing's going on with me.
1598292 1601779 No you are right, it's totally normal to lie in the grass and stare at the sky.
1601799 1603625 No, I was just  ...
1605069 1607112 You are seeing something, aren't you?
1611969 1613709 Can you tell me?
1620272 1622125 Give me your hands.
1635704 1637355 What do you see?
1640012 1642412 - Oh my goodness... - You see it?
1643044 1644622 Yes.
1645484 1647071 It's water.
1647828 1649790 Come on, concentrate.
1656247 1657615 Uhmm Hi!
1658172 1661277 Jonas was just teaching me about his training.
1661446 1665439 - As you can see, its "incredibly interesting".<br />- It can't be as great as mine.
1665671 1667691 Can't have your minds blow...?
1672425 1675446 - Whoa! Do You know how to fly those?<br />- Absolutely!
1675466 1678301 Short off ... I'm learning.
1680196 1683626 When I'm flying, looking down at everything ...
1684189 1688672 - It's like I'm seeing things for the first time.<br />- You get to fly into elsewhere?
1688700 1689913 Oh Yeah !
1689933 1692019 Once, when I was looking at that mist ...
1692520 1695596 Even they told us that there is nothing close to the edge,
1695677 1698250 I thought I saw a tree out there somewhere.
1700244 1703639 don't get too excited, I've  actually seen elsewhere.
1703752 1707519 Just mostly our farm rocks that kind of stuff.
1707595 1709285 What's weird about them?
1709585 1713693 There is these two huge rocks leaning against each other
1713769 1716596 making a kind of .. triangle.
1716740 1718586 Hey It's kind like our triangle!
1718724 1720962 - What's past their?<br />- don't know.
1721157 1723029 Not allowed to fly past there.
1725004 1726897 So many secrets ...
1727104 1728913 So what are your secrets?
1729614 1730950 Ah ... nothing.
1730988 1734311 What do you mean, "Ah, nothing"? You are receiver of memory.
1738655 1740397 Maybe I can show you.
1741267 1743642 -OK. Grab a tray.<br />- What  ...?
1743892 1746584 Bring it over the solar plate, come on!
1746747 1749734 Hey this might seem little funny, but you gotta trust me.
1751609 1753535 Ok. Sit down on the tray.
1754849 1756082 Careful ...
1756102 1758102 -Whooa! You're not gonna ...<br />- What are you scared?
1758122 1761414 I'm scared of nothing. I was just..
1761871 1765178 - It's against the rules, Jonas.<br />- Since do you care about the rules?
1768023 1770284 Actually I have auxiliary training.
1770928 1772503 I'll see you guys.
1774196 1778473 Look who grew up, but ... lucky for you I haven't.
1784467 1786692 Okay ...? Now go!
1814701 1816896 Put your heels down, slow it!
1832099 1834776 I think your training may be more funnier than mine.
1834796 1837822 Please standby, for a Community announcement.
1837885 1840314 Citizens are reminded that it is impolite
1840334 1844098 to touch community members outside of your family unit.
1844118 1845735 Thank You.
1847998 1851524 He is punctual. He is inquisitive.
1851544 1854909 - How inquisitive?<br />- He's interested in his position.
1854997 1857220 Then why is he breaking the rules?
1857796 1862381 He has been observed trying to share his training with his former classmates.
1862432 1864653 That always happens.
1865292 1867929 But it's an impossible experiment.
1868341 1872506 Even I tried to share of the memories back when I was in training.
1872707 1874532 If you remember ...
1875158 1877978 So ... forget about it.
1879210 1883051 I don't tell you what to do in your position, so don't tell me.
1883165 1885450 I apologise, but ...
1885563 1891421 - Isn't that is happening now?<br />- Your apology is accepted, but ... You're being careless.
1891441 1896216 You are moving too fast, we both know what happened ten years ago with the girl.
1896491 1899681 That girl had a name.
1901891 1904873 You think I do not remember her name?
1905168 1908090 I know you feel her loss.
1918371 1921725 The boy must hold in the pain.
1923731 1926131 Don't fail us again.
1936926 1938845 Want me to read all these?
1939835 1941414 Uhh, what's this ...?
1941434 1946284 "One day you should meet a boy who answers to the name of Jonas."
1947291 1950106 "He should be the most powerful of all receivers".
1950194 1952980 - Wait: that says ...? - Do not be gullible.
1957554 1959389 "Plan for sameness."
1959478 1962751 - Another trick? - Actually, no.
1965626 1967980 It's some kind of .. Map.
1968312 1972092 Triangle of Rocks! It's true, my friend Asher actually saw it !
1972423 1975795 Look at all this towers ... What are they for?
1975815 1978340 How could your friend saw the Triangle of Rocks?
1978360 1981031 He is a pilot; he told me, he saw it.
1981568 1985828 What's past that? Past the "outer edge; boundary of Memories"?
1985848 1988240 A mistery.
1988528 1993093 "Boundary Memories"; that have they built so that the memories only stay within you and me?
1993113 1995301 - Let's move on.<br />- Wait!
1995370 1997715 That boundary is meant to keep the memories in.
1997735 2002317 So, if a receiver crosses it, is that means the memories get set free?
2002924 2009484 Perhaps. Perhaps if you and I crossed it, everyone could feel those memories again.
2010116 2012658 So what am I seeing today?
2013790 2015494 Nothing.
2017119 2019428 You are seeing nothing today.
2026703 2029311 We already covered "seeing beyond".
2030174 2033147 There is also such a thing as "hearing beyond".
2033167 2037267 A table ...? All the food would slip on the floor.
2039699 2042673 Now don't judge me...
2043149 2045116 I'm not very good.
2045842 2048691 Even though I had a very good teacher.
2059767 2061473 Music ...
2063136 2066576 Well ... the music when I press the right keys.
2085303 2090547 Just like music, there's something else you can see with your eyes.
2091028 2095195 Something lies deep inside you.
2095365 2096970 Something ...
2097052 2100243 This morning injections take away.
2100388 2103014 I thought injections are for our health.
2103283 2105204 No, they remove something.
2105374 2106861 What?
2107431 2109206 Emotions!
2111375 2113152 you mean my feelings...?
2114733 2117536 Feelings are just fleeted
2117675 2119409 on the surface.
2120041 2123940 But emotions they are very deep ...
2124072 2127032 Primal ... they linger
2128457 2130126 and Jonas...
2131444 2135031 You might not understand where you are or what's happening.
2135095 2137833 But don't think about what you are seeing.
2138052 2139794 Listen!
2141694 2144899 Listen to what's calling from inside.
2156613 2158355 Antonio!
2159022 2161386 What a beautiful wedding!
2190431 2192783 Why would anyone want to get rid of this?
2192896 2194784 Good question ...
2200708 2203482 - What are you doing ...? - Take my hands!
2203757 2205252 Ready?
2208076 2209907 Are you ready for the fast part?
2214082 2215587 Come back!
2215607 2217846 - Spin! - What are you doing with her?
2217909 2220152 Jonas says it's called dancing.
2222359 2225072 Please standby for a transmission.
2227028 2231410 - I apologize for my intrusion.<br />- We accept your apology.
2231473 2235394 - I just wanted to say Hello.<br />- Hello.
2235576 2238453 - I am Lily.<br />- Yes, I know.
2238504 2240926 You are nine now, isn't that right?
2241127 2245488 Lily, I think it's ... time for school. Now we are going.
2245571 2247067 Hello, Jonas.
2247486 2250148 - Hello.<br />- How's your training?
2250149 2251418 Injected.
2251439 2255210 - Fine.<br />- I'm concerned about the receiver.
2256048 2259972 - Many years ago there was an incident.<br />- What kind of incident?
2260067 2265628 Living alone in a building at the edge can isolate a person.
2265710 2269609 I am concerned that the receiver is ... becoming reckless.
2270141 2272735 Are you being properly prepared?
2273036 2275879 - I think so.<br />- You are focused?
2277023 2280709 Perhaps you are spending too much time with friends from your childhood?
2280779 2285009 - I'm focused.<br />- Jonas! What do you in the receiver, actually do?
2285050 2288927 - My rules say I'm not allowed to share.<br />- She is the Chief Elder.
2289115 2291450 Jonas she only wants to help.
2291732 2293348 You are right.
2294586 2297747 But you can't tell the receiver I told you.
2298111 2299776 You have my word.
2299839 2303316 We sit in chairs and don't talk all day long.
2303616 2308774 And when the time is up I came back here, and in the morning, I do it all again.
2311394 2313962 I apologize, but I'm late.
2314119 2316578 Your apology is accepted.
2318103 2319796 Goodbye Mother.
2323145 2324482 Injected.
2324714 2326392 He is not usually like this.
2326424 2329589 I'm surprised you're not more worried about him.
2331390 2333750 were he my responsibility...
2334032 2335740 I would be.
2335890 2340814 We had been told that Chief Elder knew everything. Things nobody else did.
2341263 2344672 But I had learned that knowing of what something is ...
2345059 2348195 It's not the same as knowing how something feel.
2352842 2356790 You could be the best, the last one at top of the mountain ...
2356810 2359437 Gasping for air, having survived ...
2359457 2361124 and be alone.
2361198 2362699 Be curious.
2362719 2365926 I got lost ... to good kind of lost!
2366289 2370223 I saw sites and sounds, I had no words to describe.
2370244 2372780 Faces fleshed with different colours.
2372854 2374712 I felt so alive ...
2374732 2376557 This was forbidden?
2376577 2379301 I did not know what to think, what to believe.
2379971 2382472 "Have faith", The Giver told me.
2382690 2386293 He said: "Faith, that was seeing beyond."
2386363 2390247 He compared it to the wind: something felt but not seen.
2390267 2396425 don't accept. What is the truth just because it's coming from someone you respect.
2396445 2399427 I feel completely stupid, a weird feeling.
2399447 2401536 - Fucking weird ...<br />- Thing goes in your hand.
2401892 2406942 Memories are not just about the past; they determine our future.
2407424 2411627 You can change things; you can make things better.
2415671 2417427 It's just life..
2418176 2420742 It just seemed more complete.
2422143 2426348 The more I experienced, the more I wanted.
2426730 2431704 Once there were and other living things.
2431960 2433841 But unlike us
2434110 2436950 they knew who their mothers and fathers were.
2437976 2440085 They had joy ...
2440485 2442324 And they had pain.
2444531 2447196 I can't prepare you for what's going ...
2447217 2449064 No need to warn me every single time ...
2449084 2452733 No, Jonas. You do not understand: there are tremendous cruelty ...
2452753 2456264 Giver! I'm not a kid any more. Show me.
2465926 2468955 That's $250,000 of ivory...
2468975 2470912 Come on. Come on!
2472225 2474207 - Put in!<br />- Again, again.
2478609 2480269 No, stop !
2480676 2482081 Stop!
2487335 2488923 Stop...
2509344 2510754 Hey!
2510898 2513491 Hey, Gabe? Okay Gabe ...
2515228 2518655 If I tell you a secret, you promise not to tell anyone?
2521536 2523354 I'll take that as a "yes."
2524205 2526524 This comfort object ...
2526894 2528795 is not a hippo.
2529788 2534233 It's an elephant; and once it was real.
2536265 2538150 And it was beautiful ...
2556780 2562317 Citizens are reminded that sleep period commences in 15 minutes.
2562337 2563773 Thank You.
2611102 2614199 It was like a memory, but Fiona was there.
2614219 2615852 You had a dream.
2616209 2618313 - A what? - A "Dream".
2618526 2623631 A combination of reality, fantasy, emotions and what you had for dinner.
2627962 2631111 You've stopped taking your injections, haven't you?
2635495 2638082 Emotion's so strong ...
2638320 2642359 And it was the wedding! Everyone all together laughing and dancing ...
2642597 2646780 The older and the young, the bride and the groom,<br />there was something there.
2648150 2650181 But different from what we have.
2650232 2651815 Yes ...
2652471 2654625 We don't have that anymore.
2656232 2657955 What do you mean by that?
2659293 2663420 I'm talking about what you feel for someone else.
2664696 2669941 And mind can not explain it and you can't make it go away.
2670129 2672379 - What is it?<br />- Love.
2674435 2677239 It's called "Love".
2678685 2680224 Love ...
2683330 2684845 Oh Hi!
2684958 2686201 Hi!
2687145 2688859 So what's new?
2691015 2694089 - What's new with you?<br />- What's ever new?
2698491 2701423 - Why are you being weird?<br />- I'm  not.
2701830 2703189 I'm just ...
2703792 2705210 I'm just ...
2714159 2716230 Lad the hippo game!
2716576 2718131 Hold on!
2718208 2720146 Father, do you love me?
2720166 2721471 Jonas.
2721491 2724361 Precision of language. Please!
2724599 2726530 What does "love" mean?
2726550 2727925 I got him, Lily.
2727945 2731969 Jonas uses the word so inadequate that it no longer has any application.
2732107 2735210 If you ask, "Do you enjoy me" ...
2735521 2737807 The answer is certainly "Yes".
2737901 2741148 Or Do Mother and I take pride in your accomplishments ...
2741505 2744644 Of course we do. Do you understand?
2746487 2749820 Yes. I think I finally do.
2753638 2756177 Hey! Heyyy..  Gaaabe...!
2773073 2775216 I love you, Gabriel...
2798645 2801708 Giver! You were right, I asked my family about love and ...
2801728 2803853 get down ... get down!
2803916 2805320 Giver!
2805743 2808414 They are in the trees! There are in the trees, Robbie!
2808434 2810980 Get down! Robbie, get down!
2811001 2812515 Robbie, get down!
2812535 2814910 Robbie, get down! Stay down!
2814930 2816652 I didn't see you, man!
2816728 2817968 You are in the trees!
2818501 2821376 - Stay down!<br />- ... Any casualties?
2821396 2822933 May Day!
2827730 2830588 We are under intense shooting!
2830689 2832465 Send help!
2833212 2834943 Robbie... Robbie!
2836915 2838312 No ...
2874434 2875775 Jonas...
2876434 2877805 What ...?
2877825 2880595 - I'm sorry Jonas...<br />- How do people do that?
2880615 2883005 I didn't mean you to receive that.
2883106 2885012 Not for years.
2885319 2888186 don't.. don't let this come back to your way.
2888206 2891685 - I'm not strong enough.<br />- Of course, not yet. But Jonas ...
2891705 2895541 This what we need to know, so we can advise!
2896742 2900020 I can't ... I'm sorry, I can't ..
2900652 2903207 - I just can't.<br />- Jonas!
2903227 2904643 Jonas!
2904775 2907290 Jonas, Come back!
2907646 2909044 Please!
2909064 2911611 Come back inside, Let me explain it!
2911631 2914685 When you see something like that ... there is no explanation.
2914705 2918036 Rosemary ... Promise me you'd come back tomorrow!
2918056 2919775 Rosemary!
2942148 2945525 Hey, Jonas! Come on. You r.. Just in time.
2948689 2950990 I did never want to go back ...
2951166 2953266 I didn't want the wisdom.
2953335 2955231 I didn't want the pain.
2955801 2958040 I just wanted my childhood again.
2958272 2961026 Scrap Knees and ball games ...
2961301 2963807 Back then we had played "war".
2964377 2966562 But the war was real.
2966693 2968750 The Elders understood that.
2969238 2971421 They erased it from our world.
2972409 2974465 Maybe they were right.
2989088 2991320 - Could you watch over Harry for me?<br />- Of course.
2996608 2998264 Hey, what's wrong?
2999133 3001977 - Nothing.<br />- I know you.
3002390 3005019 - You do, do you?<br />- Yes ...
3005776 3008839 What do you think would happen if you skip the morning injection?
3009474 3010852 If you skipped it?
3011009 3013785 Then the sensors would blink and remind me that I forgot it.
3013805 3015923 No I don't mean if you forgot, I mean ...
3015943 3019306 What do you think would happen if you choose not to be injected?
3019732 3021885 Jonas, I thought something is wrong.
3021923 3024793 There is something wrong. Everything is wrong.
3024813 3028014 I quit. Fiona, I'm done being the receiver.
3028539 3031465 - This Morning, I skip the injection.<br />- Wait: "You quit" ...?
3031486 3033863 Cut your finger and put a little blood on this apple.
3033883 3036445 No, you can't quit; If you quit your position, you get sent to elsewhere.
3036465 3040442 Leave in the morning, put the apple over the sensor; it will find your blood and think it's your hand.
3040462 3041820 Stop, you're scaring me.
3041840 3044395 Fiona, you need you to do this; I need you to feel what I know.
3044415 3045695 Jonas.
3046069 3050704 - An apple  wouldn't even work.<br />- I've been doing it for months; it worked every single time.
3052491 3054987 Don't quit; You can't leave.
3057412 3059999 I don't think I can go back to that place.
3064524 3068652 - You will, if you want me to do this.<br />- Okay, fine.
3070040 3072997 But tomorrow, after work, meet me in the Triangle.
3075210 3077300 I wanted to share with her.
3077557 3080313 Not all of it; but the good things.
3080645 3082759 Was I wrong to want that?
3083854 3087567 I thought about her now. All the time.
3115010 3118850 Hello...? I have something to show you.
3123744 3125330 Come here!
3127774 3129421 Who are you?
3131040 3132665 Come over here and try this.
3132685 3134084 - Me...?<br />- Me?
3134104 3136165 Yeah, I want to teach you.
3143762 3145566 You've come back.
3145960 3148953 - Where did you learn that?<br />- From the memories you gave me.
3149092 3151026 And you've been doing it, quietly?
3152219 3153793 It's beautiful.
3153814 3155085 Who's that?
3155105 3156335 This....
3156356 3157871 is Rosemary.
3158747 3160684 The previous Receiver.
3161310 3163261 She is the one that all talk about.
3166797 3168923 She no longer exists ...
3170467 3172337 Except here.
3172788 3174839 And in my memories.
3179283 3182167 She was in training only two short months.
3182386 3185491 Look how the fingers move ...
3185803 3187593 Unlike you...
3188344 3190651 She wanted to experience...
3191416 3193332 Well, everything!
3193415 3197276 I've only given her pleasant, beautiful memories.
3198095 3199598 She fought me ...
3199618 3201312 - Don't protect me!<br />- No!
3201332 3204017 Don't show me a map and then not give me all the memories.
3204079 3205874 - I thought we're gonna help.<br />- We will.
3205894 3208184 - But must move slow.<br />- Show it to me!
3208701 3210558 You gave her war?
3213715 3216669 I gave her the memory of a child.
3217369 3220482 A child taken from her mother.
3221145 3223278 I gave her loss ...
3224266 3226054 Too soon!
3226149 3227998 You need to gonna hang on this.
3228855 3231291 The light went from her eyes ...
3233317 3236756 The next morning, without telling me...
3237113 3240699 She went to the Chief Elder and asked to be released.
3242743 3246249 So she was released. And now lives in Elsewhere.
3250460 3251955 Yes, Receiver.
3251975 3254058 I'd like to see this morning's release.
3254078 3256275 Thank you for your instructions.
3256420 3257777 Okay...
3260284 3261771 That's my father!
3261819 3263239 This one is heavier.
3263272 3265461 - More twins! Great!<br />- Watch!
3265481 3267350 Oh good...
3267419 3269945 For a moment, I thought they'd be exactly the same.
3270377 3272823 - Here we go...<br />- Then we have a problem!
3273292 3275754 - Okay ...<br />- Thank you, Dinah.
3276045 3278154 - Hey new...
3279322 3281535 Only one unit less.
3311776 3315211 Oh, I know it hurts, I know ...
3316117 3320835 But we've to put in a vein,<br />and the ones in your arms are too tiny.
3320879 3322669 Almost, almost there ...
3323112 3326100 That! It wasn't so bad, was it?
3333055 3334667 That's death.
3334806 3338457 - He doesn't know what he is doing.<br />- "Doesn't know what he is doing" ...?
3340119 3343172 - He killed him!<br />- But he doesn't know what it means.
3343716 3347178 Just like you did; neither did Rosemary.
3347734 3351692 How can he not see the baby isn't moving?<br />Doesn't that tell him that something is wrong?
3351712 3353938 The young and the older killed.
3354020 3358161 Your friend, Fiona, she will soon be trained to release as well.
3358181 3361699 That's a lie. She would never do that.
3361800 3365430 - If Fiona understood ...<br />- We are the only ones who understand it.
3365450 3366910 Then it's our fault.
3366930 3370619 You, me and all the receivers back n back n back n back.
3370639 3372557 Perhaps to be a way to show them.
3372677 3375488 To give them memories so they can understand!
3375601 3377939 - Yes ...<br />- Because if you can't feel ...
3379037 3382369 - What's the point?<br />- What what can you do?
3420245 3424879 Did it work? I don't know how long it takes for the injection to review, but there a day was long enough ...
3424899 3426946 Why I do this, Jonas?
3427415 3430335 On the walk here I was thinking of how was I scold you.
3430355 3435204 How I was say always, fine for you to break the rules, because you are chosen ...
3435224 3439201 When I thought about telling you, I just I...
3439845 3442504 I began to think about you.
3446067 3447799 Was this okay?
3451687 3453847 Do you feel anything?
3455365 3457886 - It feels like ...<br />- Fiona.
3457906 3460452 - What do you feel?<br />- I don't know, I don't ...
3460472 3462738 have words to describe it.
3462758 3465349 Warm...? Does it feel warm?
3465369 3468566 - Warm ...? - Does it feel nice?
3475982 3479846 No, I'm on the night shift;  I need to ...
3479897 3482013 I don't feel right, Jonas.
3482033 3485016 I need to go and get my injection, I need to go to work.
3496009 3499587 - What was that?<br />- Fiona, there is more.
3499707 3501778 So much more.
3514265 3518065 I remember that now. I've dreamed of her.
3518271 3520100 When I was younger.
3520701 3522825 I told my parents ...
3522928 3527213 "It was the stirrings" they said. "Everyone had them."
3527339 3531691 "Medication would stop them. Nothing that couldn't be fixed."
3531711 3534617 "Precision of language" and teacher said:
3534637 3537429 - "That's right, Lily".<br />- Very Good!
3537793 3541237 Jonas ... Just in time for feelings.
3541657 3543614 - Lily telling us how ... - Where's Gabe?
3543635 3545930 Uncertain was returned to the Nurturing Center.
3545950 3549325 - What happened?<br />- He failed his test of maturity
3549489 3554293 Again. I couldn't ask for another extension,<br />so I have to release into elsewhere.
3554881 3558330 - Released him...?<br />- We certainly gave our best try, didn't we?
3559922 3564051 - But he is family.<br />- Precision of language, please!
3564071 3567158 Sit down. Eat with us.
3570146 3572414 I just need to rest for a while.
3584633 3587647 I hadn't been wrong; this was wrong.
3587860 3591542 They hadn't eliminated murder.<br />They brought it home!
3591786 3594263 They just called it by a different name.
3601019 3604741 Father; he didn't know any better.
3606373 3608145 I did.
3628768 3632913 Jonas, what are you doing?<br />It's against the rules to leave your Community this late.
3632933 3636591 Asher, there is something I have to do; it's right, but it's sort against the rules.
3636611 3640306 If it's right thing to do ... How can it be against the rules?
3640327 3643555 There are things that I've learned that you don't know, that you can't know; Not because it's your fault ...
3643575 3647278 - Jonas you need to go back to your family unit!<br />- But that's the point!
3647435 3650295 It isn't my family! And neither is yours!
3650352 3652352 -Asher, I need to go.<br />-Jonas, listen!<br />-Get out of my way.
3652372 3654372 - Jonas! Listen<br />- What are you ...?
3678920 3680227 Giver!
3681496 3683365 Giver! Wake up.
3683835 3686970 - I've to be sleeping to wake up.<br />- Something can be done.
3687058 3689299 - Something can be done!<br />- What're you proposing?
3689319 3691889 All the memories back n back n back n back can be returned.
3691915 3694774 I need to leave the Community; I need to find the boundary of memories.
3694849 3696968 - And then? - And then cross it!
3696988 3698682 - No more discussion.<br />- A slowly ...
3698702 3700443 - Gabe is in danger.<br />- Slowly.
3700463 3703267 I can't wait anymore! Something must be done!
3705731 3708281 If you had that map, then why you didn't try to leave?
3708301 3711323 I was waiting, for someone like you.
3711793 3714766 You're the reason we have a chance, so ...
3715242 3718143 The plan will be for you to go and for me to stay.
3718163 3720578 If you did cross this boundary ...
3721191 3724667 And if the memories are set free, all of the pain that you felt  all the ...
3724793 3727456 Confusion, chaos , it would all return!
3727476 3730129 - So you have to stay to help them?<br />- Yes.
3731524 3733396 And for my daughter.
3733728 3735627 That's what you would have wanted.
3735647 3738514 - Your daughter...?<br />- Rosemary.
3738921 3742690 Now: your friend if he truly saw the Triangle of Rocks ...
3742710 3746261 Bring up Jonas activity for the past year as well.
3746768 3750544 - So Asher came directly to you?<br />- Yes.
3750564 3753389 What was Jonas's disposition at the evening meal?
3753410 3757158 Dissatisfied. Anxious. Indignant.
3757239 3760030 Set up a communication with the receiver's memory.
3760068 3762879 We're not permitted to see into the receiver's residence.
3762899 3767380 - We can only transmit.<br />- Well then we shall only transmit.
3767400 3772543 If you go, head towards the triangle; away from the other communities.
3772563 3774505 That will lead to the Boundary of Memories.
3774525 3776774 Please, stand by for a transmission.
3776850 3780829 - I apologize for the intrusion.<br />- I accept your apology.
3780917 3785063 We have a problem: receiver in training is missing,
3785145 3788061 And he physically attacked his friend, Asher.
3788136 3793240 - He did? That's serious.<br />- Do you know where Jonas is?
3795084 3796776 I do not.
3800524 3803038 Well thank you very much for ...
3803095 3805607 helping us to narrow down the possibilities.
3805689 3810123 - I'll contact you if he comes here.<br />- Only if it's not an imposition.
3811155 3812490 Thank you.
3815127 3817039 He is lying...
3817103 3819564 - Talk!<br />- They are going to kill Gabe.
3819665 3822618 I'm leaving; I'm leaving tonight and I'm going to take him with me.
3822825 3824825 Jonas, not yet, you're not ready.
3824851 3827911 When they decided to kill Gabe, they decided I was ready.
3833811 3838169 I like this map. Don't mess it up, I'll be wanting it back.
3841420 3845108 You won't mind if I accelerate your training a bit?
3848290 3853151 You'd think that someone who is the keeper of emotions, then I'd be better ...
3854433 3856180 Well ...
3856687 3859735 I love you, Jonas.
3862610 3864677 Look ... Here it is.
3865777 3869279 You have the courage ... Let me give you the strength.
3869300 3870523 Can I just ...
3897190 3899171 Attention all community residents.
3899191 3903138 The Receiver in training has been reported missing from his dwelling.
3903184 3906621 Please be alert, You may be in danger.
3912489 3917273 Group 1, from the inside edge.<br />Then Group 2, from the center out.
3917343 3918915 No I think like this.
3922384 3925376 Welcome to the Nurturing Center.
3930008 3932162 - Shall I convey the others?<br />- Yes.
3934751 3938134 Jonas! I heard an alert. What's going on?
3938154 3940551 Hey, Where's Gabe? Is he here?
3940595 3944366 - Is any of this?<br />- If he is back then, he be with the Uncertains
3944386 3947591 - In the Restricted floor.<br />- Show me where.
3947742 3949555 Fiona! Please.
3951706 3953607 They are down stairs, come on.
3953720 3958757 Jonas was chosen for the most important position in our community.
3959145 3962323 He was asked if he was strong enough.
3962398 3964129 It turned out he was not.
3964335 3967045 Instead, he's a rebel.
3967165 3968849 He must be stopped.
3968918 3970472 By you.
3970535 3972535 When you find him ...
3973398 3974826 Take him.
3975083 3977439 - Gabe is in danger.<br />- Jonas, he is fine, I'll show you.
3977496 3979096 No, he is not fine.
3979165 3980591 He should be here.
3980629 3983984 - Fiona: I'm leaving, tonight.<br />- "Leaving"?
3984152 3985968 - What do you mean?<br />- I'm taking Gabe.
3986021 3989184 We are Leaving the Community.<br />I want you to come with us.
4000493 4003780 I don't have the words to describe it.
4008272 4012211 Fiona there is more. So much more.
4015824 4017447 What are they doing?
4017479 4021836 - Fiona: what do you feel?<br />- I don't have the words to describe it.
4021856 4024257 Attention Nurturers.
4024391 4028777 Please secure your work area and immediately report to the newborn's nursery,
4028853 4031669 to allow for security search procedures.
4031970 4036099 Promptly report all sightings at the nearest security kiosk.
4036650 4038247 Thank You.
4049860 4052325 Fiona, we gotta go now! You, me and Gabe!
4052345 4056658 Jonas, I can't what about my family unit the other new Children?
4056753 4058412 I can't leave them.
4058481 4061588 This the only way, This is the only way to make everything okay.
4064450 4066136 I can't go.
4069212 4071534 When I get there, you'll understand.
4072003 4074384 - I'll come back for you.<br />- Jonas!
4082002 4083335 Come back!
4085045 4086562 Now go, Jonas!
4087364 4089751 Hey freeze, freeze!
4203260 4207378 Subject lost to the edge. Search terminated.
4207398 4211477 And I asked him why he was out so late. He seemed angry.
4211578 4215047 I did not understand why, but I wanted to help him.
4215068 4218071 Then it hit me; And, at first ...
4218147 4222575 I can tell why you've been acting this way;<br />your injections level is extremely low.
4225094 4226882 I can correct this.
4227057 4229311 "Friends forever" right ...?
4231587 4234394 Then we will address what's happened.
4247176 4250747 When I went over the edge, we shouldn't have made it.
4250822 4253049 This was a miracle.
4253244 4255573 The Giver had talked about them.
4255974 4259228 He told me that I could draw strength from the memories.
4260279 4262473 I knew, by giving them to Gabe,
4262999 4265325 I could protect it.
4269743 4272173 cut your finger and put a little blood on this apple.
4272193 4277490 When you leave in the morning, put the apple on the sensor.<br />I've been doing it for months; since worked every single time.
4277510 4279415 What has he taught ...?
4279440 4281182 A dwelling is not a "home".
4281202 4284183 This the only way to make everything okay.
4284224 4287584 Gabe is in danger. What they are gonna do him is really bad.
4287605 4289539 I want you to come with us.
4289753 4292914 When I get there, you'll understand. I'll come back for you.
4293626 4295086 Yes ...
4299919 4301380 Careful ...
4301768 4303198 Careful.
4305835 4307672 I apologize ...
4307898 4309647 For failing again.
4309667 4311326 I don't think you failed.
4311395 4313281 I think you succeeded.
4313394 4315003 With your plan ...
4315129 4318107 Ever since the girl was released you haven't been the same.
4318164 4321258 I genuinely hoped Jonas would help you.
4321403 4324715 It would have fresh start, if you two have work together ...
4326555 4328405 Which is seems you have.
4329387 4331529 We will find Jonas.
4358846 4363678 Jonas, our Receiver of Memories, lost to the Edge.
4363698 4366156 Jonas...! Jonas...!
4373372 4377511 - How did they know Jonas is gone?<br />- We must not say his names anymore.
4377855 4381290 - I will.<br />- You must keep quiet now, Lily.
4383318 4385630 and hippo is really "an elephant".
4395350 4399015 What I'm about to tell you, you must never repeat to anyone.
4399496 4403530 - I don't believe Jonas is lost.<br />- But the ceremony of Loss ...
4403687 4405479 I'm not sure of it.
4405798 4410788 I do not expect you to understand, but you must know that Jonas has become dangerous.
4411483 4415908 He must be stopped. He must not get beyond the Triangle of Rocks.
4416472 4418450 What you want me to do?
4418550 4422648 You know Jonas; I want you to find him.
4424628 4426287 And then ...
4426808 4429122 I want you to lose him.
4435559 4438291 Power Depleted.
4507664 4509189 Jonas...
4509690 4513006 - What are you doing...?<br />- Asher please, let us go.
4514168 4516493 I can't. I'm supposed to...
4516533 4517944 To what?
4520181 4521700 To loose you.
4523989 4526538 Asher ... if you're my friend ...
4526657 4530616 If you were ever my friend ... can you please somehow trust me?
4530636 4532406 Trust me now.
4575913 4578078 I do trust you, Jonas.
4589421 4591469 Come on. Please...
4593782 4595112 Jonas...!
4613185 4614818 You found him!
4616441 4617900 I did.
4618270 4620512 For the good of all of us ...
4620756 4624142 I beg you, to finish this.
4625055 4626908 It's finished.
4644441 4646171 Hey. It's okay ...
4654702 4659281 Nothing the Giver had shown me, had prepared me for the voices in my head.
4659301 4661385 Screaming me to stop.
4662023 4664984 But I knew that Fiona will be punished for helping me.
4665061 4667360 Asher, for let me go.
4667648 4671172 The only way to help them, to keep them alive ...
4671572 4673691 Was to get to the boundary.
4674229 4676284 If it even existed.
4678759 4683598 I strengthened Gabe with memories of having enough and knowing joy.
4687074 4690446 It was in memory of Fiona for kept me going.
4700170 4701446 Fiona?
4704478 4708369 I have taken care of everything. We've arranged for your release.
4708389 4710160 It will be a nice ceremony.
4710180 4712566 Now you get some rest.
4712854 4714954 - I felt things.<br />- What?
4714974 4717159 - I know that there is something more.<br />- Fiona ...
4717179 4719445 Something missing from our lives.
4719633 4723343 No, not "missing"; something that has been stolen
4723363 4724978 from me and from you.
4725647 4728210 I do not know what it is exactly.
4729249 4730875 But Jonas does.
4732232 4735946 I had felt things. And they were warm ...
4736584 4738491 And they were nice.
4740506 4742573 And they were beautiful.
4742955 4746911 I have felt things. I have felt things!
4747755 4749871 I have felt things ...!
4797345 4799532 Where is the Tower, Gabe?
4801352 4803446 The Tower should be here ...
4861937 4863830 You can stop this ...
4863906 4865522 Stop what?
4866129 4869526 If you don't want to see it, sit down with the other Elders.
4869970 4871782 or close your eyes!
4875990 4879569 Ceremony of Release to Elsewhere.
4881026 4882665 Come on, Fiona.
4884583 4886263 You're comfortable?
4892600 4896185 I'm not uncomfortable, I'm afraid.
4896986 4898853 You don't have to be afraid.
4899316 4901036 You know me.
4901337 4904693 I will be very gentle, I promise.
4905168 4906605 Okay...?
4909026 4911660 Her name was Rosemary.
4911785 4913628 She was my daughter.
4913710 4916678 - I loved her...<br />- Precision of language.
4916698 4918873 I could not be more precise.
4918893 4921319 Do you know what that's like?
4922345 4924537 To love someone?
4925051 4926839 I do.
4930227 4932524 I cried.
4932649 4934565 I felt sorrow ...
4934866 4937437 I've sang, danced ...
4938244 4940646 I felt real joy ...
4940666 4945465 Then you should know better then anyone.
4946747 4949658 You have seen children starve ...
4949679 4950896 Yes.
4950916 4954331 You have seen people stabbing on each other's neck ...
4954376 4956167 Just for the view.
4956887 4960178 You know what it is people like when men blow each others up.
4960199 4961405 Yes
4961425 4964338 - Over a simple land, sand ...<br />- I do, I do.
4964358 4966260 - But ...<br />- And yet ...
4966280 4971371 And yet! You and Jonas want to open that door again.
4971490 4975573 - Bring all that back.<br />- If you only could only see possibilities ...
4975593 4977665 - But why?<br />- Of love!
4977685 4980521 With love comes faith, with love comes hope ...
4980541 4983376 Love is just passion that can turn.
4983396 4986959 It turns into contempt! And murder!
4986979 4988714 We could choose better!
4990877 4994305 People are weak. People are selfish.
4995643 4998118 When people have the freedom to choose ...
4998343 5000253 They choose wrong.
5000391 5002498 Every single time.
5082351 5084106 That's a sled...
5086170 5089434 Loss ... and pain ...
5089779 5092655 Music... Joy ...
5092937 5096151 These are all ... impossible,
5096171 5098302 without the beautiful feeling of love!
5098322 5100619 Your son, he felt it.
5116340 5118221 That girl...
5118534 5120696 -She'd felted.<br />-That's enough.
5120716 5123172 We are living a life of shadows.
5123348 5128678 Of echoes, of fake distant whispers that once made us real.
5128746 5130505 Excuse me for one second, Fiona.
5130525 5132593 We must continue.
5234317 5237471 I wish I would have been there when the memories returned.
5237922 5240058 They were the truth.
5240302 5243477 The Elders and their rules were a lie.
5244583 5247328 So I do not apologize.
5251203 5253621 I knew Fiona was safe.
5253746 5255859 That I'd see her again.
5256279 5259500 And that I held the future there in my arms.
5263157 5265855 The Giver had led us here.
5266281 5268111 To this house ...
5268562 5270410 It was real.
5272567 5276429 From far behind me, from the place I had left ...
5276836 5279444 I thought I heard music too.
5280532 5283137 Perhaps it was only an echo.
5283669 5285856 But it was enough.
5286594 5289621 It will lead us all home.
