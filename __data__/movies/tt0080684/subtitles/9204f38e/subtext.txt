214882 216800 Han, old buddy, do you read me?
216884 218802 <i>Loud and clear, kid. What’s up?</i>
218886 219845 I finished my circle.
219928 221680 I don’t pick up any life readings.
221763 225017 <i>There isn’t enough life on this ice cube</i><br /><i>to fill a space cruiser.</i>
225100 226935 <i>Sensors are placed. I’m going back.</i>
227019 228812 Right. I’ll see you shortly.
228896 230772 There’s a meteorite<br />that hit the ground near here.
230856 233192 I want to check it out. It won’t take long.
233275 234693 [Braying]
234776 237196 Steady, girl. What’s the matter?
237279 239239 You smell something?
239323 240782 Rrraaah!
279863 281240 Chewie!
281323 283784 Chewie?
283867 285118 Chewie!
288163 289831 All right! Don’t lose your temper.
289915 292084 I’ll come right back and give you a hand.
312813 313897 Solo?
313981 316149 No sign of life out there, General.
316233 317526 The sensors are in place.
317776 318902 You’ll know if anything comes around.
318986 320445 Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
320529 322865 No. He’s checking out<br />a meteorite that hit near him.
322948 324992 With all the meteor activity<br />in this system,
325075 326827 it’s going to be difficult to spot<br />approaching ships.
326910 329121 General, I got to leave. I can’t stay anymore.
329204 330163 I’m sorry to hear that.
330247 331373 Well, there’s a price on my head.
331456 332958 If I don’t pay off Jabba the Hutt,
333041 334251 I’m a dead man.
334334 336420 A death mark’s not<br />an easy thing to live with.
336503 338005 You’re a good fighter, Solo.
338088 340090 I hate to lose you.
340174 342092 Thank you, General.
349016 352186 Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.
352269 354188 That’s right.
354271 357816 Well, don’t get all mushy on me.
357900 359401 So long, Princess.
361486 364281 Han!
364364 366283 Yes, Your Highnessness?
366366 368368 I thought you had decided to stay.
368452 371455 Well, the bounty hunter we ran into<br />in Ord Mantell changed my mind.
371538 373498 Han, we need you!
373582 374583 <i>We need?</i>
374875 375834 Yes.
375918 376919 <i>Well, what about you need?</i>
377002 378003 <i>I need?</i>
378086 380297 I don’t know what you’re talking about.
380380 382174 You probably don’t.
382257 384092 And what precisely am I supposed to know?
384176 386011 Come on!
386094 388305 You want me to stay<br />because of the way you feel about me.
388388 391099 Yes! You’re a great help to us.<br />You’re a natural leader.
391183 393852 No! That’s not it.
393936 395270 Come on.
395354 396855 A-ha!
396939 398315 You’re imagining things.
398398 400192 Am I? Then why are you following me?
400275 403195 Afraid I was gonna leave<br />without giving you a good-bye kiss?
403278 404613 I’d just as soon kiss a Wookiee!
404905 406198 I can arrange that.
406281 408283 You could use a good kiss!
409451 412621 I didn’t ask you to turn on the thermal heater.
412913 416208 I merely commented that it was freezing<br />in the princess’s chamber.
416291 418627 How will we dry out her clothes?
418877 419878 <i>[Beep Beep]</i>
419962 421380 Oh, switch off!
421463 424633 Why did you take this apart now?<br />I’m trying to get us out of here, and you pull both-
424883 425884 Excuse me, sir.
425968 426885 Put them back together now!
426969 428262 Might I have a word with you, please?
428345 429304 What do you want?
429388 431890 Well, it’s Princess Leia, sir.<br />She’s been trying to get you on the communicator.
431974 434226 I turned it off.<br />I don’t want to talk to her.
434309 436228 Well, Princess Leia<br />is wondering about Master Luke.
436311 438188 He hasn’t come back yet.<br />She doesn’t know where he is.
438272 439273 I don’t know where he is.
439356 440357 Nobody knows where he is.
440440 441650 What do you mean, nobody knows?
441900 443652 Well, uh, you see-<br />Deck Officer!
443902 445237 Deck Officer!<br />Excuse me, sir, might I-
445320 446280 Yes, sir?
446363 447656 Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
447906 449241 I haven’t seen him.
449324 450659 It’s possible he came through<br />the south entrance.
450951 453412 <i>It’s possible?</i><br /><i>Why don’t you go find out?</i>
453495 454580 It’s getting dark out there.
454663 456039 Yes, sir.
456123 458250 Excuse me, sir.<br />Might I inquire what’s going on?
458333 459459 Why not?
459543 460669 Impossible man.
460919 462254 Come along, R2, let’s find Princess Leia.
462337 463422 Between ourselves,
463505 466216 I think Master Luke is in considerable danger.
466300 468927 [Braying]
475684 478061 Sir, Commander Skywalker<br />hasn’t come in the south entrance.
478145 479354 He might have forgotten to check in.
479438 480522 Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
480606 482941 Uh, not yet. We’re having trouble<br />adapting them to the cold.
483025 484109 We’ll have to go out on tauntauns.
484193 485944 Sir, the temperature’s dropping too rapidly.
486028 488280 That’s right,<br />and my friend’s out in it.
492451 495162 Your tauntaun will freeze<br />before you reach the first marker.
495245 497706 Then I’ll see you in hell. Hyah!
520729 523315 Rrraaah!
527027 530531 [Grumbling]
575701 577244 Grrrr!
592092 593802 Graaah!
632549 635260 <i>[Blip Beep Beep]</i>
635344 637095 You must come along now, R2.
637179 639223 There’s really nothing more we can do.
639306 641517 And my joints are freezing up.
641600 642601 <i>[Beep Beep]</i>
642684 644102 Don’t say things like that!
644186 645562 Of course we’ll see Master Luke again.
645646 649149 And he’ll be quite all right. You’ll see.
649233 651109 Stupid little short circuit.
651193 653278 He’ll be quite all right.
653362 654571 <i>[Beep Blip]</i>
710502 712671 Sir, all the patrols are in.
712754 713755 Still no-
714798 717676 Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
717759 721513 Mistress Leia, R2 says he’s been<br />quite unable to pick up any signals,
721597 725767 although he does admit that his own range<br />is far too weak to abandon all hope.
725851 727686 Your Highness,<br />there’s nothing more we can do tonight.
727769 730189 The shield doors must be closed.
731481 732441 Close the doors.
732524 733525 Yes, sir.
733609 735360 <i>[Beep Beep Beep]</i>
735444 740449 R2 says the chances of survival are 725 to 1.
749208 750417 Gahhh!
750501 755297 Actually, R2 has been known to make mistakes...
758300 760219 from time to time.
760302 761678 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
763430 764598 <i>[Beep Beep Beep]</i>
764681 766600 Don’t worry about Master Luke.
766683 768227 I’m sure he’ll be all right.
768310 770687 He’s quite clever, you know, for a human being.
786370 787704 <i>Luke.</i>
790374 791667 <i>Luke.</i>
799258 800676 Ben?
800759 803470 <i>You will go to the Dagobah system.</i>

830789 832708 Don’t do this, Luke.
832791 836378 Come on, give me a sign here.
857608 859401 Not much time.
859484 860652 Ben.

869578 871622 Dagobah system.
871705 872664 Whew!
872748 875667 This may smell bad, kid...
875751 877753 Yoda.
877836 879588 but it’ll keep you warm...
879671 881840 till I get the shelter up.
881924 884551 Ben...Dagobah...
884635 886345 Ahhh!
886428 892518 Ah! I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
934601 936979 Echo Base, I’ve got something.
937062 940148 Not much, but it could be a life-form.
944111 946613 Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
946697 948615 This is Rogue Two.
948699 951076 This is Rogue Two.

970053 972556 Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
972639 973932 I’ve found them.
974016 975893 Repeat, I’ve found them.
1006089 1008800 Master Luke, sir, it’s so good<br />to see you fully functional again.
1008884 1009843 Thanks, 3PO.
1009927 1010928 <i>[Beep Blip]</i>
1011011 1012721 R2 expresses his relief also.
1012804 1015599 How ya feelin’, kid?<br />You don’t look so bad to me.
1015682 1018977 You look strong enough<br />to pull the ears off a gundark.
1019061 1020604 Thanks to you.
1020687 1023148 That’s two you owe me, junior.
1023232 1024900 Well, Your Worship,
1024983 1027861 looks like you managed to keep me around<br />for a little while longer.
1027945 1029613 I had nothing to do with it.
1029696 1032699 General Rieekan thinks it’s dangerous<br />for any ships to leave the system
1032783 1034034 until we’ve activated the energy field.
1034117 1036036 That’s a good story.
1036119 1040082 <i>I think you just can’t bear to let</i><br /><i>a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.</i>
1040165 1043627 I don’t know where<br />you get your delusions, laser brain.
1043710 1045254 Hah hah hah!
1046713 1048632 Laugh it up, fuzzball,
1048715 1052010 but you didn’t see us alone<br />in the south passage.
1052094 1054680 She expressed her true feelings for me.
1054763 1056014 My-
1056098 1059059 Why, you stuck-up, half-witted,

1061895 1064982 Who’s scruffy-looking?
1067526 1071780 I must have hit pretty close to the mark<br />to get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
1075117 1078745 Well, I guess you don’t know<br />everything about women yet.

1094219 1096763 Excuse us, please.
1099641 1101727 Princess, we have a visitor.
1101810 1105564 Picked up something<br />outside the base’s Zone 12 moving east.
1105647 1106607 It’s metal.
1106690 1107941 Then it couldn’t be one of those creatures.
1108025 1109610 Could be a speeder, one of ours.
1109693 1110903 No.
1110986 1112029 Wait.
1112112 1114823 There’s something<br />very weak coming through.
1114907 1117993 [Radio Static]
1118076 1121163 Sir, I’m fluent in six million<br />forms of communication.
1121246 1123916 This signal is not used by the Alliance.
1123999 1126168 It could be an imperial code.
1129755 1131590 It isn’t friendly, whatever it is.
1131673 1133592 Come on, Chewie, let’s check it out.
1133675 1136887 Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.
1153028 1154238 Grrr!
1168085 1169962 Gahhh!
1171839 1172965 <i>I’m afraid there’s not much left.</i>
1173048 1174007 What was it?
1174091 1175634 <i>Droid of some kind.</i>
1175717 1177636 <i>I didn’t hit it that hard.</i><br /><i>Must’ve had a self-destruct.</i>
1177719 1179304 An imperial probe droid.
1179388 1182641 <i>It’s a good bet the Empire knows we’re here.</i>
1182724 1184726 We’d better start the evacuation.
1229021 1230814 Admiral.
1230898 1232191 Yes, Captain?
1232274 1234693 I think we’ve got something, sir.
1234776 1238363 The report is only a fragment<br />from a probe droid in the Hoth system,
1238447 1239823 but it’s the best lead we’ve had.
1239907 1242910 We have thousands of probe droids<br />searching the galaxy.
1242993 1244077 I want proof, not leads.
1244161 1246038 The visuals indicate life readings.
1246121 1247080 It could mean anything.
1247164 1248373 If we followed up every lead-
1248457 1251710 But, sir, the Hoth system<br />is supposed to be devoid of humans.
1251793 1252920 You’ve found something?
1253003 1254129 Yes, my lord.
1256465 1258884 That’s it. The rebels are there.
1258967 1263388 My lord, there are so many<br />uncharted settlements.
1263472 1264473 It could be smugglers-
1264723 1266266 That is the system.
1266350 1268894 And I’m sure Skywalker is with them.
1268977 1271980 Set your course for the Hoth system.
1272064 1274233 General Veers, prepare your men.
1274316 1275817 Admiral.
1282157 1284868 Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind<br />to fly the speeders.
1284952 1286411 As soon as each transport is loaded,
1286495 1288747 evacuation control will give clearance<br />for immediate launch.
1288830 1289831 Right, sir.
1292918 1295003 All right! That’s it.
1295087 1296129 Try it.
1297965 1301051 Oh! Turn it off! Turn it off!
1301134 1303262 Turn it off!
1303345 1307057 Sir, it will take quite a while<br />to evacuate the T-47s.
1307140 1308100 Forget the heavy equipment.
1308183 1311061 There’s plenty of time to get<br />the smaller modules on the transports.
1311144 1312104 Take care, sir.
1312187 1313188 Thanks.
1316191 1319319 Chewie, take care of yourself, O.K.?
1322948 1324867 O.K., O.K.!
1326326 1327870 Hi, kid.
1327953 1330372 There’s got to be a reason for it.<br />Check it at the other end.
1330455 1331832 Wait a second.
1332916 1334209 You all right?
1334293 1335544 Yeah.
1342050 1344303 Be careful.
1344386 1346221 You, too.
1351226 1357107 General, there’s a fleet of Stardestroyers<br />coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.
1357191 1360110 Reroute all power to the energy shield.
1360194 1363113 We gotta hold them till all transports are away.
1363197 1364573 Prepare for ground assault.
1378587 1380422 What is it, General?
1380506 1382257 My lord, the fleet<br />has moved out of light speed.
1382341 1387095 ComScan has detected an energy field protecting<br />an area of the sixth planet of the Hoth system.
1387179 1389848 The field is strong enough<br />to deflect any bombardment.
1389932 1392518 The rebels are alerted to our presence.
1392601 1395521 Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed<br />too close to the system.
1395604 1397523 He-He felt surprise was wiser.
1397606 1400192 He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
1400275 1403529 General, prepare your troops<br />for a surface attack.
1403612 1405197 Yes, my lord.
1412204 1413872 Lord Vader.
1413956 1416124 The fleet has moved out of light speed,<br />and we’re preparing to-
1416208 1417876 Aaugh!
1417960 1421547 You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.
1421630 1422965 Captain Piett.
1423048 1424550 Yes, my lord?
1424633 1427636 Make ready to land our troops<br />beyond their energy field
1427886 1430889 and deploy the fleet<br />so that nothing gets off the system.
1430973 1434142 You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
1434226 1435561 Thank you, Lord Vader.
1435644 1437062 [Gagging]
1437229 1440482 All troop carriers will assemble<br />at the north entrance.
1440566 1443402 The heavy transport ships<br />will leave as soon as they’re loaded.
1443485 1445571 Only two fighter escorts per ship.
1445654 1448448 The energy shield<br />can only be opened for a short time,
1448532 1451076 so you’ll have to stay very close<br />to your transports.
1451159 1453495 Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?
1453579 1456081 The ion cannon<br />will fire several shots
1456164 1459168 to make sure that any enemy ships<br />will be out of your flight path.
1459251 1461336 When you’ve gotten past the energy shield,
1461420 1463505 proceed directly to the rendezvous point.

1468594 1470012 Let’s go.
1487029 1490324 Their primary target will be<br />the power generators.
1490407 1492159 Prepare to open shield.
1497956 1500125 Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.
1500209 1502294 Good. Our first catch of the day.

1538121 1539748 Just like new, Dak. How about you?
1539998 1543043 Right now I feel I could take on<br />the whole Empire myself.
1543126 1545295 I know what you mean.
1563522 1564648 Echo Station Three-T-Eight.

1591508 1593802 Echo Station Five-Seven. We’re on our way.

1610777 1612529 All right. I’m coming in.
1617117 1619244 Hobbie, you still with me?
1640724 1642851 That armor’s too strong for blasters.
1645395 1647564 Rogue Group,<br />use your harpoons and tow cables.
1647648 1651443 Go for the legs.<br />It might be our only chance of stopping them.
1651527 1653487 All right. Stand by, Dak.
1653570 1656448 Oh, Luke,<br />we’ve got a malfunction in fire control.
1656532 1658492 I’ll have to cut in the auxiliary.
1658575 1661286 Just hang on. Hang on, Dak.
1661370 1663497 Get ready to fire that tow cable.
1665707 1666583 Ah!

1669878 1670879 Dak!
1693902 1696822 Yes, Lord Vader,<br />I’ve reached the main power generators.
1696905 1698490 The shield will be down in moments.

1707624 1709543 Wedge, I’ve lost my gunner.
1709626 1710836 You’ll have to make this shot.
1710919 1712713 I’ll cover for you.
1712796 1716383 Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.
1716466 1718468 Coming around, Rogue Leader.
1721305 1723599 Steady, Rogue Two.

1766767 1768644 I see it, Wedge. Good work.
1768810 1771230 I don’t think we can protect<br />two transports at a time.
1771313 1773565 It’s risky, but we can’t hold out much longer.
1773649 1775901 We have no choice.

1832583 1833542 Rogue Two, are you all right?
1833625 1835961 Yeah. I’m with you, Rogue Leader.
1836044 1838005 Well, set harpoon. I’ll cover for you.

2268810 2269853 I think we’re in trouble.
2269937 2273482 If I may say so, sir, I noticed earlier<br />the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.
2273732 2275359 It’s impossible to go to light speed.

2321280 2324950 You’re not actually going<br />into an asteroid field?
2325033 2327953 They’d be crazy to follow us,<br />wouldn’t they?
2330038 2331957 You don’t have to do this to impress me.
2332040 2336879 Sir, the possibility of successfully navigating<br />an asteroid field is approximately 3,720 to 1.
2336962 2338547 Never tell me the odds!
2360903 2362529 Look out!
2365157 2368493 You said you wanted<br />to be around when I made a mistake.
2368577 2370329 This could be it, sweetheart.

2927970 2928887 [Chuckling]
2928971 2930848 Hey, give me that!
2930931 2933559 Mine, or I will help you not.
2933642 2935477 I don’t want your help. I want my lamp back.
2935561 2937563 I’m gonna need it to get<br />out of this slimy mudhole.
2937646 2938981 Mudhole? Slimy?
2939064 2941775 My home this is-
2941859 2944403 Wha-Mmm!
2944486 2946029 R2, let him have it.
2947990 2950450 Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
2950534 2951618 R2!
2953912 2956164 Now, will you move along, little fellow?
2956456 2957916 We’ve got a lot of work to do.
2957999 2959585 No! No, no!
2959668 2963046 Stay and help you I will... find your friend.
2963130 2965549 I’m not looking for a friend.
2965632 2966842 I’m looking for a Jedi master.
2966925 2971096 Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.
2971180 2972806 You seek Yoda.
2972890 2974016 You know him?
2974099 2977603 Mmmm. Take you to him I will.
2977686 2982191 Yes, yes, but now we must eat. Come.
2982482 2983942 Good food.
2984026 2985527 Come.
2994661 2996538 Come, come.
2997873 3002711 R2...stay and watch after the camp.
3015724 3018477 Oh! Where is R2 when I need him?
3018560 3021605 Sir, I don’t know where your ship<br />learned to communicate,
3021688 3023482 but it has the most peculiar dialect.
3023565 3026985 I believe, sir, it says that the power coupling<br />on the negative axis has been polarized.
3027069 3029613 I’m afraid you’ll have to replace it.
3029696 3032908 Well, of course I’ll have to replace it.
3032991 3034576 Here!
3034660 3036537 And, Chewie...
3038038 3040791 I think we’d better replace<br />the negative power coupling.
3061854 3065774 Hey, Your Worship,<br />I’m only trying to help.
3065858 3068110 Would you please stop calling me that?
3068193 3070279 Sure, Leia.
3070571 3072573 You make it so difficult sometimes.
3072656 3074616 I do. I really do.
3074700 3077619 You could be a little nicer, though.
3077703 3080622 Come on, admit it.<br />Sometimes you think I’m all right.
3082082 3084585 Occasionally...maybe...
3084668 3087129 when you aren’t acting like a scoundrel.
3087212 3089047 Scoundrel?
3089131 3090757 Scoundrel?
3092968 3095554 I like the sound of that.
3095637 3096555 Stop that.
3096638 3098223 Stop what?
3098307 3100559 Stop that. My hands are dirty.
3100642 3103020 My hands are dirty, too.<br />What are you afraid of?
3103103 3104229 Afraid?
3104313 3106231 You’re trembling.
3106315 3108025 I’m not trembling.
3108108 3112237 You like me because I’m a scoundrel.
3112321 3114573 There aren’t enough scoundrels in your life.
3114656 3117034 I happen to like nice men.
3117117 3118076 I’m a nice man.
3118160 3119953 No, you’re not. You’re-
3122664 3123749 Sir, sir!
3123832 3126335 I’ve isolated the reverse<br />power flux coupling.
3128712 3129922 Thank you.
3130005 3131256 Thank you very much.
3131340 3133175 Oh, you’re perfectly welcome, sir.
3139223 3142601 And that was the last time<br />they appeared in any of our scopes.
3142684 3144102 Considering the amount of damage we’ve sustained,
3144186 3145604 they must have been destroyed.
3145687 3148190 No, Captain. They’re alive.
3148273 3153362 I want every ship available to sweep<br />the asteroid field until they are found.
3157282 3158742 Lord Vader.
3158825 3160744 Yes, Admiral. What is it?
3160827 3163747 The emperor commands you<br />to make contact with him.
3163830 3168669 Move the ship out of the asteroid field<br />so that we can send a clear transmission.
3168752 3170170 Yes, my lord.
3186687 3189147 What is thy bidding, my master?
3190274 3195237 There is a great disturbance in the Force.
3195320 3197781 I have felt it.
3197865 3200325 We have a new enemy,
3200409 3204413 the young rebel<br />who destroyed the Death Star.
3204705 3212212 I have no doubt this boy<br />is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.
3212296 3214673 How is that possible?
3214756 3218177 Search your feelings, Lord Vader.
3218260 3221430 You will know it to be true.
3221680 3224057 He could destroy us.
3224141 3226268 He’s just a boy.
3226351 3228896 Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
3228979 3232733 The Force is strong with him.
3233942 3238906 The son of Skywalker<br />must not become a Jedi.
3238989 3241158 If he could be turned,
3241241 3244119 he would become a powerful ally.
3244203 3246872 Yes.
3247915 3252044 He would be a great asset.
3252127 3254379 Can it be done?
3254463 3258425 He will join us or die, master.
3275108 3276360 Look, I’m sure it’s delicious.
3276443 3279321 I just don’t understand<br />why we can’t see Yoda now.
3279404 3280405 Patience!
3280489 3281949 For the Jedi,
3282032 3283867 it is time to eat as well.
3283951 3285869 Hmm? Heh heh.
3285953 3289081 Eat, eat.
3289164 3290249 Hot!
3297965 3300008 Good food! Mmm, good, hmm?
3300092 3303136 How far away is Yoda?<br />Will it take us long to get there?
3303220 3305013 Not far. Yoda not far.
3305097 3308225 Patience. Soon you will be with him.
3310811 3312271 Root leaf.
3312354 3313856 I cook.
3313939 3318277 Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?
3318360 3320445 Mostly because of my father, I guess.
3320529 3321905 Ah, father.
3321989 3324283 Powerful Jedi was he.
3324366 3326285 Hee hee. Mmm, powerful Jedi.
3326368 3328161 Oh, come on.
3328245 3329788 How could you know my father?
3329872 3331456 You don’t even know who I am.
3331540 3333458 I don’t even know what I’m doing here.
3333542 3335377 We’re wasting our time!
3336420 3338297 I cannot teach him.
3338380 3340924 The boy has no patience.
3341008 3343468 <i>He will learn patience.</i>
3343552 3344887 Hmm...
3348307 3350893 Much anger in him,
3350976 3352936 like his father.
3353020 3356857 <i>Was I any different when you taught me?</i>
3358066 3359943 No.
3360027 3361862 He is not ready.
3361945 3363238 Yoda.
3365365 3366825 I am ready.
3366909 3369161 Ben- I can be a Jedi.
3369244 3371205 Ben, tell him I’m-
3371288 3372831 Ready, are you?
3372915 3375083 What know you ready?
3375167 3378504 For 800 years have I trained Jedi.
3378587 3384176 My own counsel will I keep<br />on who is to be trained.
3384259 3388931 A Jedi must have the deepest commitment, hmm?
3389014 3390933 The most serious mind.
3392518 3396605 This one a long time have I watched.
3396855 3399858 All his life has he looked away...
3399942 3403028 to the future, to the horizon.
3403111 3406532 Never his mind on where he was,
3406615 3407866 hmm?
3407950 3409910 What he was doing.
3409993 3411453 Hmph!
3411537 3412621 Adventure.
3412913 3413914 Ha!
3413997 3415332 Excitement. Ha!
3415415 3418126 A Jedi craves not these things.
3418210 3420921 You are reckless!
3421004 3424007 <i>So was I, if you remember.</i>
3424091 3426969 He is too old.
3427052 3429638 Yes, too old to begin the training.
3429888 3432349 But I’ve learned so much.
3435978 3437229 Ahh...
3438647 3441567 Will he finish what he begins?
3441650 3443402 I won’t fail you.
3444987 3446530 I’m not afraid.
3448156 3449366 Oh...
3450993 3452995 You will be.
3454288 3456373 You will be.
3495537 3497039 [Squealing]
3497122 3498332 Aah!
3498415 3500334 Sir, if I may venture an opinion-
3500417 3502377 I’m not really interested in your opinion.
3502461 3503712 There’s something out there.
3504004 3505130 Where?
3505214 3506215 Outside in the cave.
3506298 3507716 [Banging]
3507966 3509218 There it is. Listen. Listen!
3509301 3510344 I’m going out there.
3510427 3511428 Are you crazy?
3511512 3512971 I just got this bucket back together.
3513055 3515098 I’m not going to let something tear it apart.
3515182 3516975 Then I’m going with you.
3517059 3518519 I think it might be better
3518602 3520646 [Roar]<br />if I stay behind and guard the ship.
3520729 3521730 Oh, no.
3535661 3539039 This ground sure feels strange.
3539122 3541542 It doesn’t feel like rock.
3545087 3548465 There’s an awful lot of moisture in here.
3548549 3550384 I don’t know.
3550467 3553512 I have a bad feeling about this.
3553595 3554680 Yeah.
3556431 3557391 Watch out!
3558517 3559768 It’s all right.
3560018 3561019 It’s all right.
3561103 3563021 Yeah, that’s what I thought-mynock.
3563105 3567317 Chewie, check the rest of the ship<br />and make sure there are no more attached,
3567401 3569528 chewing on the power cables.
3569611 3571071 Mynocks.
3571154 3573365 Go on inside.<br />We’ll clean them off if there are any more.
3577786 3579538 Han!
3581248 3583792 Aagghh! Go away, go away, beastly thing!
3584042 3585127 Shoo! Shoo!
3591758 3593677 Wait a minute...
3615490 3616742 Let’s get out of here!
3616825 3619161 The Empire is still out there!<br />I don’t think-
3619244 3621413 No time to discuss this in committee!
3621496 3623498 I’m not a committee!
3629505 3632424 You can’t make the jump<br />to light speed in this asteroid field.
3632508 3635260 Sit down, sweetheart! We’re taking off!
3639097 3640098 Look!
3640182 3641391 I see it. I see it.
3641475 3642434 We’re doomed!
3642518 3643769 The cave is collapsing.
3643852 3645854 This is no cave.<br />What?
3678679 3679680 Run!
3679763 3683642 Yes! A Jedi’s strength flows from the Force.
3683725 3686436 But beware of the dark side.
3686520 3688230 Anger, fear, aggression-
3688313 3691400 The dark side of the Force are they,
3691483 3694403 easily they flow,<br />quick to join you in a fight.
3694486 3697281 If once you start down the dark path,
3697364 3699408 forever will it dominate your destiny.
3699491 3700826 Consume you it will,
3700909 3702744 as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.
3702828 3704329 Vader.
3704413 3706623 Is the dark side stronger?
3706707 3708208 No, no.
3708292 3709585 No.
3709668 3712212 Quicker, easier, more seductive.
3712296 3715174 How do I know<br />the good side from the bad?
3715257 3718427 You will know when you are calm,
3718510 3720429 at peace,
3720512 3722222 passive.
3722306 3727352 A Jedi uses the Force<br />for knowledge and defense,
3727436 3729563 never for attack.
3729646 3730647 But tell me why I can’t-
3730731 3732774 No, no. There is no why.
3732858 3735652 Nothing more will I teach you today.
3735736 3738363 Clear your mind of questions.
3738447 3742201 Hmm...
3742284 3743785 Mmm...
3760636 3762763 There’s something not right here.
3766475 3768644 I feel cold...
3768727 3769811 death.
3769895 3771980 That place...
3772272 3775400 is strong with the dark side of the Force.
3775484 3777736 A domain of evil it is.
3779488 3781240 In you must go.
3781323 3783575 What’s in there?
3785536 3787579 Only what you take with you.
3791834 3793585 Your weapons...
3793669 3795879 you will not need them.
3808725 3809810 [Squish]

3956540 3957875 We don’t need their scum.
3957958 3959459 Yes, sir.
3959543 3961628 Those rebels won’t escape us.
3963422 3965174 [Speaking Alien Language]
3967134 3971597 <i>Sir, we have a priority signal</i><br /><i>from the Stardestroyer Avenger.</i>

3983692 3986028 No disintegrations.
3986111 3987988 As you wish.
3988071 3989448 Lord Vader.
3989531 3992075 My lord, we have them.
3996705 3999833 Oh, thank goodness<br />we’re coming out of the asteroid field.
4003545 4005464 Let’s get out of here.
4005547 4006882 Ready for light speed?
4006965 4008133 1...
4008217 4009968 2...
4010052 4011220 3!
4017226 4018644 It’s not fair.
4018727 4020062 Gahhh!
4020145 4022481 Transfer circuits aren’t working.
4022564 4024566 It’s not my fault!
4024650 4025651 No light speed?
4025734 4027653 It’s not my fault.
4032241 4034243 Sir, we’ve just lost<br />the main rear deflector shield.
4034535 4036745 One more direct hit<br />on the back quarter and we’re done for.
4036828 4038622 Turn her around.
4038705 4040832 I’m going to put all power<br />in the front shield.
4040916 4042167 You’re going to attack them?
4042251 4045546 Sir, the odds of surviving<br />a direct assault on an imperial-
4045629 4047589 Shut up!<br />Gaahh!
4053971 4055973 They’re moving to attack position.
4058100 4059268 Shields up.
4063981 4065274 Track them.
4065566 4067609 They may come around for another pass.
4067693 4070028 Captain Needa, the ship<br />no longer appears on our scopes.
4070112 4072030 They can’t have disappeared.
4072114 4074741 No ship that small has a cloaking device.
4074825 4076702 Well, there’s no trace of them, sir.
4076785 4078745 Captain, Lord Vader<br />demands an update on the pursuit.
4081123 4082875 Get a shuttle ready.
4082958 4087212 I shall assume full responsibility for losing them<br />and apologize to Lord Vader.
4087296 4089214 Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.
4089298 4090966 Yes, Captain Needa.
4095721 4097973 Use the Force.
4098056 4099057 Yes.

4143685 4145312 So certain are you.
4147356 4148899 [Sighs]
4148982 4152069 Always with you it cannot be done.
4153862 4155864 Hear you nothing that I say?
4155948 4158283 Master, moving stones around is one thing.
4158367 4159993 This is totally different.
4160077 4161745 No! No different!
4161828 4164122 Only different in your mind.
4164206 4167960 You must unlearn what you have learned.
4168043 4170629 All right. I’ll give it a try.
4170712 4172297 No! Try not.
4172381 4174758 Do.
4174842 4176093 Or do not.

4235110 4236111 Hmm?
4236195 4237738 Hmph!
4237821 4239990 And well you should not,
4240073 4243202 for my ally is the Force.
4243285 4246205 And a powerful ally it is.
4246288 4248457 Life creates it,
4248749 4250250 makes it grow.
4251460 4255214 Its energy surrounds us...
4255297 4257216 and binds us.
4257299 4259468 Luminous beings are we,
4259718 4261470 not this crude matter.
4261720 4265807 You must feel the Force around you-
4265891 4269186 Here, between you, me,
4269269 4273106 the tree, the rock, everywhere!
4273190 4274483 Yes...
4276151 4280072 Even between the land and the ship.
4284076 4286078 You want the impossible.

4394561 4396897 I don’t believe it.
4397940 4401193 That is why you fail.
4419878 4423966 Apology accepted, Captain Needa.
4431473 4435143 Lord Vader, our ships have completed<br />their scan of the area and found nothing.
4435227 4439565 <i>If the Millennium Falcon went into light speed</i><br /><i>it’ll be on the other side of the galaxy by now.</i>

4446113 4447364 Yes, my lord. We’ll find them.
4447447 4449491 Don’t fail me again...
4450492 4451577 Admiral.
4453161 4455080 Alert all commands.
4455163 4457124 Deploy the fleet.
4472097 4474308 Captain Solo,<br />this time you’ve gone too far.
4474391 4475684 Gahhh!
4475976 4478437 I will not be quiet.<br />Why doesn’t anyone listen to me?
4478520 4480439 The fleet’s beginning to break up.
4480522 4484610 Go back and stand by<br />the manual release for the landing claw.
4487070 4489072 I really don’t see how that’s going to help.
4489156 4492326 Surrender is a perfectly acceptable alternative<br />in extreme circumstances.
4492409 4494286 The Empire may be gracious enough-
4494369 4495329 Thank you.
4495412 4497164 What’s your next move?
4497247 4498582 If they follow standard imperial procedure,
4498665 4501627 they’ll dump their garbage<br />before they go to light speed,
4501710 4503212 and then we just float away.
4503295 4504963 With the rest of the garbage.
4505047 4506298 Then what?
4506381 4509134 Then we got to find a safe port<br />somewhere around here.
4509218 4510219 Any ideas?
4510302 4511637 Where are we?
4511720 4513222 The Anoat system.
4513305 4515224 There’s not much there.
4515307 4519186 No. Well, wait. This is interesting.
4519269 4520354 Lando.
4520437 4521980 Lando system?
4522064 4524983 Lando’s not a system.<br />He’s a man. Lando Calrissian.
4525067 4527361 He’s a cardplayer, gambler, scoundrel.
4527444 4528654 You’d like him.
4528737 4530239 Thanks.
4530322 4534076 Bespin. It’s pretty far,<br />but I think we can make it.
4534159 4536119 A mining colony?
4536203 4538497 Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.
4538580 4541500 Lando conned somebody out of it.
4541583 4544419 We go back a long way,<br />Lando and me.
4544503 4546463 Can you trust him?
4546547 4549758 No. But he’s got no love for the Empire,
4550008 4551343 I can tell you that.
4551426 4554012 Here we go, Chewie. Stand by.
4554096 4555180 Detach.
4561687 4563772 You do have your moments.
4564022 4565691 Not many of them,

4655822 4657783 They were in pain.

4661411 4662704 Future?
4671296 4673215 Will they die?
4676134 4677636 Difficult to see.
4677719 4681223 Always in motion is the future.
4682224 4684893 I’ve got to go to them.
4686478 4689398 Decide you must how to serve them best.
4689481 4692276 If you leave now, help them you could,
4692359 4697656 but you would destroy all<br />for which they have fought and suffered.
4710794 4714339 No, I don’t have a landing permit.
4714423 4718343 I’m trying to reach Lando Calrissian.

4727561 4729396 That was a long time ago.

4865657 4866658 Hey, remember,

4879087 4880506 Welcome, I’m Lando Calrissian.
4880589 4883383 I’m the administrator of this facility.
4883467 4885385 And who might you be?
4885469 4886553 Leia.
4886637 4888096 Welcome, Leia.
4891433 4894728 All right, all right, you old smoothie.
4894811 4898357 Hello, sir. I am C-3PO, human-cyborg relations.
4898440 4899775 My facilities are at your-
4899858 4901360 Well, really!
4901443 4903111 <i>What’s wrong with the Falcon?</i>
4903362 4904530 Hyperdrive.
4904613 4906532 I’ll get my people to work on her.
4906615 4908367 That ship saved my life quite a few times.
4908450 4911370 She’s the fastest<br />hunk of junk in the galaxy.
4911453 4914581 How’s the gas mine?<br />Still paying off for you?
4914665 4915916 Not as well as I’d like.
4915999 4918377 We’re a small outpost<br />and not very self-sufficient.
4918460 4919753 I’ve had supply problems of every kind.
4919837 4921380 I’ve had labor difficulties.
4921463 4922923 Ha ha ha!
4923006 4924675 What’s so funny?
4924758 4926385 You. Listen to you.
4926468 4928512 You sound like a businessman,
4928595 4929888 a responsible leader.
4929972 4932140 Who’d have thought that, huh?
4932391 4934852 Seeing you brings back a few things.
4934935 4935978 Yeah.
4936061 4937896 Yeah, I’m responsible these days.
4937980 4941984 It’s the price you pay for being successful.
4944403 4946780 Ooh. Nice to see a familiar face.
4946864 4948407 <i>E chu ta!</i>
4948490 4949783 How rude!
4949867 4951410 <i>[Beep Beep]</i>

4958041 4959751 Who are you?
4959835 4961170 Oh, my! I- I’m terribly sorry.
4961420 4962796 I didn’t mean to intrude.
4962880 4964006 No, please don’t get up.
4970596 4971930 Gahhh.
4982566 4985068 Luke, you must complete the training.
4985152 4986820 I can’t keep the vision out of my head.
4986904 4988947 They’re my friends. I got to help them.
4989031 4991200 You must not go.
4991450 4994536 But Han and Leia will die if I don’t.
4994620 4996038 <i>You don’t know that.</i>
4996121 4998999 <i>Even Yoda cannot see their fate.</i>
4999082 5001460 But I can help them.
5001543 5002878 I feel the Force.
5002961 5004546 <i>But you cannot control it.</i>
5004630 5007049 <i>This is a dangerous time for you,</i>
5007132 5010969 <i>when you will be tempted</i><br /><i>by the dark side of the Force.</i>
5011053 5014223 Yes! Yes! To Obi-Wan you listen.
5014515 5017518 The cave. Remember your failure at the cave.
5017601 5020854 But I’ve learned so much since then.
5020938 5024233 Master Yoda, I promise to return<br />and to finish what I’ve begun.
5024525 5025776 You have my word.
5025859 5028654 <i>It is you and your abilities</i><br /><i>the emperor wants.</i>
5028737 5032616 <i>That is why your friends are made to suffer.</i>
5032699 5034660 That’s why I have to go.
5034743 5040040 <i>Luke, I don’t want to lose you to the emperor</i><br /><i>the way I lost Vader.</i>
5040123 5041750 You won’t.
5041834 5043752 Stopped they must be.
5043836 5046129 On this all depends.
5046213 5048674 Only a fully trained Jedi knight,
5048757 5050592 with the Force as his ally,
5050676 5053178 will conquer Vader and his emperor.
5053262 5055514 If you end your training now,
5055597 5059852 if you choose the quick<br />and easy path, as Vader did,
5059935 5062688 you will become an agent of evil.
5062771 5063730 <i>Patience.</i>
5063814 5065983 And sacrifice Han and Leia?
5066066 5070112 If you honor what they fight for...yes.
5070195 5071905 <i>If you choose to face Vader,</i>
5071989 5073282 <i>you will do it alone.</i>
5073574 5075617 <i>I cannot interfere.</i>
5076785 5078871 I understand.

5101894 5103228 I will.
5103312 5105063 And I’ll return.
5105147 5106732 I promise.
5113322 5115240 Told you, I did.
5115324 5117075 Reckless is he.
5117159 5118243 Now...
5118327 5120120 matters are worse.
5120204 5123123 <i>That boy is our last hope.</i>
5123207 5125292 No, there is another.
5157115 5158617 The ship’s almost finished.
5158700 5160869 Two or three more things<br />and we’re in great shape.
5160953 5162621 The sooner the better. Something is wrong here.
5162704 5165123 No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.
5165207 5167626 He’s been gone too long to have gotten lost.
5167709 5172631 Relax. I’ll talk to Lando<br />and see what I can find out.
5172714 5174633 I don’t trust Lando.
5174716 5177052 Well, I don’t trust him either.
5177135 5179763 But he is my friend. Besides...
5179847 5181723 we’ll soon be gone.
5181807 5185060 Then you’re as good as gone,<br />aren’t you?
5218260 5219803 Gaahh!
5219887 5220929 What happened?
5221013 5222681 Gahhh gahhh.
5222764 5223974 Where?
5224057 5225350 Gahhh!
5225434 5227269 Found him in a junk pile?
5227352 5230189 Oh, what a mess.<br />Chewie, you think you can repair him?
5230272 5232191 Gahhh!
5232274 5234026 Lando’s got people that can fix him.
5234109 5235444 No, thanks.
5235736 5239239 I’m sorry, am I interrupting anything?
5239323 5241283 Not really.
5244870 5246955 You look absolutely beautiful.
5247039 5250292 You truly belong here with us among the clouds.
5250375 5251877 Thank you.
5251960 5254880 Would you join me for a little refreshment?
5254963 5256465 Everyone’s invited, of course.
5258008 5259885 Having trouble with your droid?
5259968 5261303 No, no problem.
5261386 5262429 Why?
5270729 5272981 You see, since we’re a small operation,
5273065 5277402 we don’t fall into<br />the jurisdiction of the Empire.
5277486 5279112 So you’re part of the Mining Guild, then?
5279196 5282407 No, not actually. Our operation<br />is small enough not to be noticed.
5282491 5284409 Which is advantageous for everybody,
5284493 5289248 since our customers are anxious<br />to avoid attracting attention to themselves.
5289331 5293752 Aren’t you afraid the Empire’s going to find out<br />about this little operation, shut you down?
5293836 5296171 It’s always been a danger that looms<br />like a shadow over everything we’ve built.
5296255 5298757 But things have developed<br />that’ll ensure security.
5298841 5303804 I’ve just made a deal<br />that will keep the Empire out of here forever.
5312521 5315399 We would be honored if you would join us.
5320946 5322281 I had no choice.
5322364 5324783 They arrived right before you did.
5324867 5326243 I’m sorry.
5330414 5332207 I’m sorry, too.

5472931 5475267 They must never again leave this city.
5475350 5476935 That was never a condition<br />of our agreement,
5477019 5478520 nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter.
5478604 5483692 Perhaps you think you’re being treated unfairly?
5483984 5484943 No.
5485027 5490115 Good. It would be unfortunate<br />if I had to leave a garrison here.
5490199 5494453 This deal is getting worse all the time.
5495621 5498540 Oh, yes, that’s very good.<br />I like that.
5498624 5499958 Oh!
5500042 5502544 Something’s not right<br />because now I can’t see.
5502628 5506715 Oh, oh, oh, that’s much better.
5506965 5508300 Wait! Wait!
5508383 5510302 Oh, my! What have you done?
5510385 5512304 I’m backwards,
5512387 5514306 you flea-bitten furball!
5514389 5518101 Only an overgrown mophead like you<br />would be stupid enough-
5531532 5533158 I feel terrible.
5533242 5534576 Gahhh.
5548298 5550592 Why are they doing this?
5553720 5557224 They never even asked me<br />any questions.
5560561 5562229 Lando.
5565065 5566066 Grrr!
5566149 5567234 Get out of here, Lando.
5567317 5569194 Shut up and listen!
5569278 5571488 Vader’s agreed<br />to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
5571572 5573407 They’ll have to stay here,<br />but at least they’ll be safe.
5573490 5574491 Leia: What about Han?
5574575 5575701 Vader’s given him to the bounty hunter.
5575784 5577369 Vader wants us all dead.
5577452 5579705 He doesn’t want you at all.<br />He’s after somebody called Skywalker.
5579788 5582374 Luke.<br />Lord Vader set a trap for him.
5582457 5584459 And we’re the bait!
5584543 5586420 He’s on his way.
5586503 5589548 You fixed us all real good, didn’t you?
5589631 5590799 My friend.
5593260 5594344 Stop!
5596388 5597806 I’ve done all I can.
5598056 5599391 I’m sorry I couldn’t do better,
5599474 5601185 but I’ve got my own problems.
5601268 5602519 Yeah.
5602603 5604521 You’re a real hero.
5614781 5617451 You certainly have a way with people.
5621246 5622748 Ah...Ah...
5631715 5634092 This facility is crude,
5634176 5639473 but it should be adequate to freeze Skywalker<br />for his journey to the emperor.
5639556 5642434 Lord Vader,<br />ship approaching, X-wing class.
5642518 5646855 Good. Monitor Skywalker<br />and allow him to land.
5647105 5650400 Lord Vader,<br />we only use this facility for carbon freezing.
5650484 5652778 You put him in there, it might kill him.
5652861 5655781 I do not want<br />the emperor’s prize damaged.
5655864 5658450 We will test it on Captain Solo.
5680889 5683725 If only you’d attached my legs,
5683809 5685769 I wouldn’t be in<br />this ridiculous position.
5685853 5687354 Now remember, Chewbacca,
5687437 5689356 you have a responsibility for me,
5689439 5691358 so don’t do anything foolish.
5704162 5705747 What’s going on,
5705831 5707457 buddy?
5707541 5710502 You’re being put into carbon freeze.
5710586 5713922 What if he doesn’t survive?<br />He’s worth a lot to me.
5714214 5716675 The Empire will compensate you if he dies.
5716758 5718677 Put him in.
5718760 5719803 Rrrah!
5719887 5722389 Rrrah! Rrrah!
5722472 5724391 Han: Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!
5724474 5727936 3PO: Yes, stop, please! I’m not ready to die!
5728187 5730522 Hey! Hey! Listen to me, Chewie.
5730606 5732691 This won’t help me.
5732774 5733942 Hey, save your strength.
5734234 5736695 There will be another time.
5736778 5738864 The princess-
5738947 5740782 You have to take care of her.
5742951 5745329 Do you hear me? Huh?
5745412 5746663 Gahhh...
5758842 5760219 I love you.
5760302 5761845 I know.
5782866 5784451 Gahhh!
5790999 5793252 What’s going on? Turn around!
5793335 5794711 Chewbacca, I can’t see.
5808851 5811019 Gahhh.
5852519 5855814 Oh, they’ve encased him in carbonite.
5855898 5857649 He should be quite well-protected,
5857733 5859651 if he survived the freezing process, that is.
5859735 5862613 Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
5862696 5864573 Yes, he’s alive.
5864656 5866783 And in perfect hibernation.
5866867 5869828 He’s all yours, bounty hunter.
5869912 5872539 Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
5874791 5876710 Skywalker has just landed, lord.
5876793 5880756 Good. See to it that<br />he finds his way in here.
5884927 5889473 Calrissian, take the princess<br />and the Wookiee to my ship.
5889556 5891683 You said they’d be left in the city<br />under my supervision.
5891767 5893769 I am altering the deal.
5893852 5896688 Pray I don’t alter it any further.

6137721 6139181 What are you doing? Trust him! Trust him!
6139264 6142267 We understand, don’t we, Chewie?<br />He had no choice.
6142351 6144019 I’m just trying to help.

6199116 6202786 Well, at least you’re still in one piece.
6202870 6205247 Look what’s happened to me.
6217176 6219887 Oh, no! Chewie, they’re behind you!
6232816 6235110 You have learned much, young one.
6235194 6237279 You’ll find I’m full of surprises.
6248290 6252044 Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.
6252127 6255214 Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
6255297 6256298 No.
6260844 6261803 Aaah!
6263388 6264932 All too easy.
6270062 6274483 Perhaps you’re not as strong<br />as the emperor thought.
6275776 6277319 Impressive.
6279238 6280822 Most impressive.
6283492 6285202 Aaah!
6288163 6290123 Obi-Wan has taught you well.

6295796 6298257 release your anger.
6298340 6301343 Only your hatred can destroy me.
6312020 6313230 Ohh!
6431515 6433934 The security code has been changed.
6434017 6437271 R2, you can tell the computer<br />to override the security systems.

6442234 6444278 Attention. This is Lando Calrissian.
6444361 6446905 Attention. The Empire<br />has taken control of the city.
6446989 6450534 I advise everyone to leave<br />before more imperial troops arrive.
6457124 6458292 This way.
6458375 6460919 Well, don’t blame me. I’m an interpreter.

6649816 6652194 With our combined strength,

6659451 6664331 If you only knew the power<br />of the dark side.
6664414 6668627 Obi-Wan never told you<br />what happened to your father.
6668710 6670504 He told me enough.
6673173 6674883 He told me you killed him.
6675133 6676510 No.
