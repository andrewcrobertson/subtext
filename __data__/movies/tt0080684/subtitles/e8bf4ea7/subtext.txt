11990 15010 GEORGE LUCAS: <i>There was never any question<br />that I was gonna make the sequels.</i>
15034 17036 <i>Once the film was a giant hit,</i>
17328 21458 <i>which I finally accepted<br />about a month after it was released,</i>
22000 26212 <i>"I said," It's a hit. I can now go ahead,<br />I can make my other movies.</i>
26296 28173 <i>I'm gonna do this."</i>
28256 32594 <i>I realized, one,<br />this was a perfect opportunity...</i>
32677 34888 <i>to become independent<br />of the Hollywood system-</i>
34971 36806 <i>financially independent.</i>
36890 40226 <i>I did not want to have to go back<br />to them and ask for more money.</i>
40310 43146 <i>I did not want to have them decide<br />which movies I got to make...</i>
43229 45148 <i>and which movies<br />I did not get to make.</i>
45231 48359 <i>I didn't want them to decide<br />what the ending should be...</i>
48485 50361 <i>or how they should recut it at the end.</i>
50487 52864 <i>That was my primary goal at that point,</i>
52989 56743 <i>was to establish an operation<br />up here in San Francisco</i>
56826 58119 <i>that was completely independent.</i>
58203 60413 <i>I was pretty much independent<br />as it was.</i>
60497 62499 <i>I didn't mind releasing it through them.</i>
62582 64959 <i>But it was going to them<br />for the money and them saying,</i>
65043 67212 <i>"The film is good,<br />but we want to make these changes."</i>
67295 69088 <i>That's the part I wanted to avoid.</i>
69172 71591 <i>So I decided I was going<br />to finance the film myself.</i>
71674 74219 <i>I decided I was going to make it<br />completely independently.</i>
74302 77305 <i>But in order to do that,<br />I felt I wasn't gonna be able to direct it-</i>
77388 80183 <i>That it was just too hard<br />to set up a company,</i>
80266 82352 <i>get the money, get the film made...</i>
82435 85188 <i>and also be down there on the set<br />every day trying to direct it.</i>
85271 89067 <i>So I decided I'd hire a director,<br />I would executive produce it-</i>
89192 90902 <i>kind of like you do on television,</i>
91027 93547 <i>which is I would oversee the script,<br />and I oversaw the casting...</i>
93571 95211 <i>and I oversaw the sets<br />and the art design,</i>
95280 96549 <i>the special effects and everything,</i>
96573 99159 <i>and I'd hire a director<br />to go in and work with the actors...</i>
99243 102079 <i>and do a day-to-day, get up<br />at 5:00 or 6:00</i>
102162 103922 <i>in the morning<br />and work until 10:00 at night.</i>
103956 106750 <i>I could show up and be on the set<br />when I needed to be,</i>
106833 109002 <i>but I could also help build the company,</i>
109086 111296 <i>make sure that we were<br />financially independent...</i>
111380 114341 <i>and deal with all the other issues<br />that had to go on around it.</i>
116301 118262 IRVIN KERSHNER:<br /><i>I told George I had never</i>
118345 119585 <i>done a special effects picture.</i>
119638 121515 <i>He said, "Don't worry about it."</i>
121598 127479 <i>There was a lot of pressure on me<br />from my agent, from myself.</i>
128146 131316 <i>Do I really want to do it?<br />Do I not want to do it?</i>
131441 134278 <i>Finally I had a talk with Gary Kurtz.</i>
134403 139408 <i>Gary would be on location,<br />which would be Norway and London,</i>
139908 142244 <i>and then talked again with George.</i>
142327 145914 <i>"He says," You just come up with the<br />ideas. Draw them. Do whatever you do.</i>
147916 150836 <i>"We'll make it work back in the lab."</i>
150919 152462 <i>And they did.</i>
157593 159970 GARY KURTZ:<br /><i>The making of</i> Empire...
160053 162514 <i>was a whole set of problems<br />that we didn't anticipate.</i>
162598 164683 <i>It was quite different than</i> Star Wars.
164766 167352 <i>Obviously, as a sequel to a big hit,</i>
167477 170022 <i>by this time<br />the highest-grossing film of all time,</i>
170147 173233 <i>there was no problem worrying about<br />whether or not it would be successful.</i>
173317 176570 <i>The problems were all about<br />what was expected.</i>
176653 181158 <i>The picture was a much bigger<br />undertaking than originally conceived.</i>
181283 184494 <i>The budget was quite a bit more<br />than we had originally thought.</i>
184620 188165 <i>It ending up being closer to $25 million.</i>
189041 193045 <i>It was primarily because<br />the expectation was so high.</i>
200010 202596 LAWRENCE KASDAN:<br /><i>I had just finished writing</i> Raiders.
202679 204681 <i>It must have been '78.</i>
204765 207225 <i>I went up to give it to George.</i>
207351 209645 <i>When I walked into his office<br />and gave him the script,</i>
209728 212981 <i>he threw it on the desk,<br />and he said, "Let's go out to lunch."</i>
213815 217819 <i>He says, "I'm in pre-production<br />on</i> Empire Strikes Back."
217903 221448 <i>Leigh Brackett,<br />who was writing the script, has died,</i>
221531 225535 <i>"and I need someone to help me now,<br />because we're really under the gun."</i>
225661 229414 <i>I said, "Don't you think you ought to<br />read</i> Raiders of the Lost Ark <i>first...</i>"
229498 231625 <i>Before you offer me this job?"</i>
231708 234628 <i>He said, "If I read it<br />tonight and I hate it,</i>
234711 236797 <i>I'll call you tomorrow<br />and take this offer back."</i>
236880 239591 <i>But he called me up the next day,<br />and he loved</i> Raiders,
239675 241301 <i>and I went forward that day.</i>
241385 243637 <i>I had a new job that day.</i>
249559 252145 KURTZ: <i>The script required,<br />by this time,</i>
252229 254189 <i>the whole opening sequence<br />in the snow.</i>
254272 256233 <i>Everybody who's dealt<br />with visual effects said,</i>
256775 258944 <i>"Never do snow,<br />because you can't maintain the color."</i>
259069 263782 <i>Minor, minor shifts in temperature<br />control will shift the white to blue.</i>
264533 266284 <i>So we ignored all those warnings</i>
266368 268787 <i>and decided to shoot<br />in the snow anyway.</i>
270163 272916 BEN BURTT: <i>We had a portable<br />tape recording system...</i>
272999 275085 <i>that had the Dolby noise reduction<br />attached to it...</i>
275168 277421 <i>and a lot of new stereo microphones.</i>
277504 281091 <i>We went out after</i> New Hope,<br /><i>and we recorded hours</i>
281174 282759 <i>of new material at army bases...</i>
282843 286721 <i>and at flight lines around the world<br />for</i> The Empire Strikes Back.
296147 298357 KERSHNER:<br /><i>This was a very primitive time.</i>
298441 300651 <i>We had no digital effects.</i>
300735 303195 <i>Everything was done the hard way.</i>
303279 305239 <i>Thank heaven for ILM.</i>
305322 307324 CARRIE FISHER:<br /><i>This was fun.</i>
307408 311036 <i>It was a very different film to shoot<br />because Kershner was very into it.</i>
311120 316167 <i>Kershner did a fantastic-<br />He talked like Yoda half the time.</i>
316792 320421 KERSHNER: <i>I met Harrison Ford,<br />and I liked him very much.</i>
320504 322757 <i>He has an interesting quality.</i>
322840 326844 <i>I started thinking,<br />"How do you really use this guy?</i>"
326927 331098 <i>How do you create a Han Solo<br />who has a history...</i>
331182 332933 <i>"and who's a human being?"</i>
333017 335770 <i>That seemed to be the job<br />that I undertook.</i>
335853 338939 <i>I wanted to make these people<br />as real as possible,</i>
339023 343152 <i>and Carrie was the key<br />to making him alive.</i>
343652 348657 FISHER: <i>Right from the beginning<br />they had this acrimonious thing...</i>
348783 351577 <i>between Harrison and I,<br />and it was great.</i>
351660 353704 Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.
354622 355706 That's right.
358542 360961 Don't get all mushy on me.<br />So long, Princess.
361045 363839 <i>It was something to play.<br />It was more human.</i>
363923 365174 Han.
366801 368552 Yes, Your Highnessness.
368636 371096 <i>In the other ones<br />it was this arch stuff...</i>
371180 376060 <i>where I was declaiming<br />this stuff to these villains...</i>
376185 380898 <i>and having to talk in this very odd<br />dialogue that was very arch.</i>
380981 383734 <i>This stuff is more relatable,</i>
383859 386904 <i>even though once more<br />Harrison got the better share.</i>
387029 388072 <i>I didn't care.</i>
388197 392535 <i>It was good to be part of something<br />even if I had to be the goat.</i>
392660 394453 <i>I don't care.<br />This was better.</i>
394537 396455 <i>And I got a new hairstyle.</i>
396539 398374 <i>But of course, it's not remembered.</i>
398457 400417 -Come on.<br />-You're imagining things.
400501 402461 Am I? Then why are you following me?
402545 404797 Afraid I'd leave<br />without giving you a good-bye kiss?
404880 407508 -I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.<br />-I can arrange that.
407591 410261 LUCAS: <i>This one is a darker story<br />than the first one.</i>
410344 413144 <i>That was a challenge to make sure<br />that it didn't turn into something...</i>
413222 415302 <i>that was significantly different<br />than the first film-</i>
415391 417852 <i>that we'd keep the tone going,</i>
417935 420604 <i>since this was designed<br />to be three films as one film,</i>
420688 422857 <i>and to keep it going<br />as the first film had started...</i>
422940 425234 <i>so that they'd be consistent<br />with one another.</i>
425359 428404 KERSHNER: <i>I was asked by George<br />to come to San Anselmo.</i>
428529 433242 <i>He said, "I'm investing my money<br />in the second film."</i>
433367 435995 <i>"What do you mean, George?"<br />"It's gonna be my money.</i>
436078 439498 <i>And the film has to be much better<br />and much bigger...</i>
439582 442334 <i>and much more complex<br />than</i> Star Wars,
442418 448632 "<i>because if the second one doesn't<br />work, it's the end of</i> Star Wars."
448716 451719 <i>I said, "It doesn't put me<br />in a very comfortable position."</i>
451802 455806 <i>He felt comfortable with it, but I didn't.</i>
455890 458100 <i>It's a hell of a responsibility.</i>
461729 463480 NORMAN REYNOLDS: <i>I'm not sure</i>
463564 465232 <i>how Norway came on the scene.</i>
465316 468861 <i>I think some research was done<br />by possibly Robert-</i>
468944 470029 <i>I don't know-Robert Watts-</i>
470112 473616 <i>with a view to finding somewhere<br />that was accessible, square one.</i>
473741 476452 <i>It doesn't matter how brilliant<br />the location is.</i>
476535 478494 <i>If it's not accessible, it's not usable.</i>
478578 483041 <i>So it virtually doesn't exist<br />in terms of the film company.</i>
483124 487211 <i>Norway came up<br />as being a possible place...</i>
487295 490089 <i>because there was a hotel<br />the foot of a glacier,</i>
490173 491674 <i>which sounded good for starters.</i>
491758 494594 <i>So we actually went to Norway...</i>
494677 496877 <i>and looked at this location,<br />and it was absolutely true.</i>
496930 499641 <i>The train stopped at the station,</i>
500183 502185 <i>and the glacier<br />was immediately behind it.</i>
502268 505980 <i>So that became the perfect<br />icy location for Hoth.</i>
508024 511152 KERSHNER:<br /><i>This picture starts right off with a bang.</i>
511277 515031 <i>It was wonderful<br />the way Mark got into it.</i>
515114 517325 <i>He never complained.</i>
517450 521871 <i>It was a harrowing experience actually,<br />being out there.</i>
521955 524082 <i>And it was kind of forbidding.</i>
524165 527835 <i>Here we were to start the film in March.</i>
527919 530672 <i>It was about 20 degrees below zero.</i>
533800 537428 FISHER:<br /><i>I was still shooting</i> Star Wars...
538471 541891 <i>when Mark got into the car accident.</i>
541975 544310 <i>It was a rather bad accident.</i>
544978 549273 <i>Miraculously, his teeth didn't shatter,<br />but his nose did.</i>
549357 552652 <i>He had to have some of his ear<br />put into his nose.</i>
552735 558032 <i>So they adjusted the film<br />with this snow monster...</i>
558157 564706 <i>to right away in the movie<br />scratch his face...</i>
564789 568084 <i>to account for his looks being different.</i>
574257 577176 LUCAS:<br /><i>Each film in this trilogy,</i>
577260 580388 <i>Luke goes from being<br />a naive farm boy...</i>
580471 583349 <i>to learning the ways of the Force.</i>
583933 587937 <i>He is on his way<br />at the beginning of this film...</i>
588062 590857 <i>to learn to use his Jedi powers...</i>
590940 594027 <i>that Obi-Wan had started<br />teaching him in the first film.</i>
594110 596904 <i>But he only had very limited training<br />in that film.</i>
597030 599407 <i>But now we see,<br />with this snow monster,</i>
599532 603953 <i>he's able to use his powers<br />to get his lightsaber back.</i>
605788 610293 KERSHNER: <i>In the original,<br />we didn't see the ice monster really.</i>
610376 612795 <i>You heard him.</i>
612879 615190 <i>You had the feeling of the ice monster,</i>
615214 616215 <i>but for the re-release...</i>
616883 621054 <i>George felt that it was good<br />to see this beast.</i>
621929 625892 <i>So a couple of shots<br />were put in of the ice monster,</i>
625975 627977 <i>and I don't think<br />it hurt the picture at all.</i>
628102 630063 <i>In fact, I think it helps it.</i>
635735 637695 BURTT: <i>Some of the effects in snow</i>
637779 640323 <i>I recorded during<br />a Christmas break back east...</i>
640406 642575 <i>where I visited my parents' home.</i>
642658 645870 <i>There was a big snowfall<br />in upstate New York at the time.</i>
645953 649791 <i>I had my father go outside and I had<br />him get dragged through the snow,</i>
649874 653836 <i>had him run and jump into the snow to<br />get the sound of body falls in the snow.</i>
653920 659008 <i>So we had some realistic snow effects<br />for some of the movements outside.</i>
662220 664347 <i>There was a good body fall there...</i>
664430 668016 <i>which was mostly my father falling in<br />the snow back in upstate New York.</i>
668100 669851 FISHER:<br /><i>This was a delight.</i>
669935 673188 <i>We were in Finse, Norway.<br />It was kind of madness.</i>
673313 677484 <i>The person that had to throw<br />the snow into the fan...</i>
677609 679653 <i>that made it look like it was snowing-</i>
679778 681822 <i>and it was snowing-</i>
681947 683782 <i>they got frostbite.</i>
684658 688995 KERSHNER: <i>The first day of shooting,<br />we haul out this big tauntaun...</i>
689121 692874 <i>which immediately freezes to death,<br />and you can't move it.</i>
693792 697587 <i>I said, "Okay" -<br />We can move the head. That's about it.</i>
697671 700799 <i>"Let's at least get the breath."</i>
701716 705053 <i>The bellows froze.<br />Couldn't work it. No breath.</i>
705137 709057 <i>"So the prop man said," Look, I'm gonna<br />pass around a bag and cigarettes.</i>
709141 713228 <i>Everybody smoke and blow into<br />this bag, and I'll use that smoke."</i>
713311 718024 <i>We're standing there like idiots going-</i><br />[DEEP BREATHES]
718150 720402 <i>Everybody on the set, into a bag,</i>
720527 722946 <i>and we got about one-</i> [EXHALES]
723029 725282 <i>I think one is all we got.</i>
725365 729161 <i>I began to discover<br />what George had told me before I left.</i>
729244 732372 <i>"He said," Remember.<br />Nothing's going to work as you plan it.</i>
732914 735250 <i>You're gonna have to make it work-<br />improvise."</i>
735333 736835 <i>And it was true.</i>
741673 744801 ANTHONY DANIELS:<br /><i>Playing 3PO is clearly awkward.</i>
744885 748013 <i>It was bound to be from the word "go."<br />I knew that.</i>
748096 752601 <i>Very nearly I really didn't want to do the<br />second film,</i> The Empire Strikes Back.
752726 756855 <i>Why would I want to relive<br />this quite lonely experience?</i>
756938 760233 <i>Then I realized first of all they were<br />gonna pay me for the second one,</i>
760358 764738 <i>and secondly,<br />I had developed a fondness for 3PO.</i>
764863 766615 <i>I'm kind of glad I know him.</i>
778710 784841 LUCAS: <i>As he goes into the snow,<br />he hallucinates and sees Ben again.</i>
784925 789471 <i>Just establishes that Ben<br />is still guiding him from the Force...</i>
789554 793141 <i>and helping him to move forward<br />in his quest to become a Jedi.</i>
793225 797395 ALEC GUINNESS: <i>It all stems<br />from George Lucas's imagination.</i>
797479 800607 <i>I have a great admiration for him.</i>
800732 804903 <i>Somehow a kind of taste that he has.</i>
804986 810075 <i>His eye is a very true, pure eye.</i>
810158 813536 <i>And I trust that...</i>
813620 819960 <i>and I trust his little things<br />I've heard him hesitate over,</i>
820043 824005 <i>saying "yes" or "no"<br />over a look in someone's eye...</i>
824089 826049 <i>or something he hears.</i>
827425 832013 <i>He can't yet say "Do it like this"...</i>
832097 834349 <i>or "Don't do it like that,"</i>
834432 836101 <i>I don't think.</i>
836184 839271 <i>But he's kind of like-What?</i>
839354 841648 <i>It's like a sort of litmus paper there.</i>
841773 845485 <i>You judge off him very well<br />as to what's going on.</i>
845610 849656 <i>He has a total passion<br />for what he's doing.</i>
849781 854035 <i>I don't think I've ever come across<br />anyone so immersed in film.</i>
854119 858956 <i>I have an idea he goes to bed in it,<br />wrapped up in it-the actual material.</i>
865170 868132 ROBERT WATTS:<br /><i>In the script</i> of The Empire Strikes Back,
868215 872303 <i>one scene we had<br />of Harrison Ford in exterior</i>
872386 874638 <i>on the snow planet Hoth was a blizzard.</i>
874722 877975 <i>Blizzards you cannot create<br />in the open air,</i>
878058 879727 <i>because of the depth of snow.</i>
879852 882062 <i>You can't blow Styrofoam through.</i>
882187 883981 <i>Number one,<br />you'll get Styrofoam everywhere.</i>
884064 888610 <i>Normally you'd build a white cyclorama<br />backing in the studio, do it there,</i>
888694 891238 <i>blow tons of Styrofoam<br />or whatever through...</i>
891322 893402 <i>and create the blizzard,<br />so you can't see through it.</i>
893490 895284 <i>You've got to do it on a stage.</i>
895367 900080 <i>We had a real blizzard<br />when we got there, and it started.</i>
900164 904668 <i>I said, "Get Harrison in, 'cause we can<br />shoot the blizzard in a real one."</i>
904752 908505 <i>Saves the stage and all of that.<br />I got him flown to Oslo.</i>
908589 912384 <i>Because of the blizzard, the railway<br />line was blocked with avalanche.</i>
912468 914188 <i>I couldn't get him in on the regular train.</i>
915596 919099 <i>I brought him in on a snowplough<br />all the way from Oslo.</i>
919224 921435 <i>He arrived at 1:00 in the morning.</i>
921560 924146 <i>I sent the location manager down<br />with a bottle of whiskey</i>
924229 925481 <i>and said, "Get him here."</i>
925564 927775 <i>He got in. I sat up and waited for him.</i>
927900 930944 <i>I said, "Hello, Harrison.<br />You're on the set tomorrow morning."</i>
931070 933864 <i>It was 1:00 in the morning he arrived.<br />The blizzard was still there.</i>
933947 937951 <i>We shot it. But we got it.<br />That's like working with what you got.</i>
939995 944792 BURTT: <i>The sound of the snowspeeders<br />were derived from aircraft sounds...</i>
944875 949046 <i>run through one of our very first<br />digital devices, a harmonizer.</i>
949129 955094 <i>It had the ability to produce a tonality<br />which would rise and fall in pitch...</i>
955177 959306 <i>as if it were a Doppler effect, the sound<br />made by something in motion.</i>
959390 963727 <i>By running the aircraft recordings<br />through this primitive harmonizer,</i>
963811 967272 <i>we were able to get the basic sound<br />of the snowspeeders.</i>
967398 972027 <i>Although the sharpest parts<br />of the pass-bys for the snowspeeders...</i>
972111 974655 <i>were sweetened with a cougar snarl.</i>
974738 979243 <i>Animal sounds, being organic,<br />and also being expressive...</i>
981412 984123 <i>and having emotions associated<br />with them are always useful,</i>
984206 986417 <i>even for inorganic objects...</i>
986500 989920 <i>be they spaceships<br />or doors or equipment.</i>
995592 998595 FISHER: <i>They've got really good<br />medical stuff in this.</i>
999972 1002641 <i>When he loses his arm,<br />they have that thing.</i>
1003684 1005602 <i>"We're so glad you're better."</i>
1011442 1013527 KASDAN:<br /><i>When you're continuing characters...</i>
1013652 1016113 <i>that have been strongly introduced<br />in a previous movie,</i>
1016196 1019658 <i>you're thinking not only<br />"How do they grow?"...</i>
1019783 1023370 <i>but "How are they the same? How are<br />they different? What's interesting?"</i>
1023454 1026999 <i>With</i> Empire<br /><i>it was clear right from the get-go...</i>
1027082 1029543 <i>that it was gonna have<br />a different tone than</i> Star Wars.
1029626 1033255 <i>I think that's part of<br />why George hired Irvin.</i>
1033338 1035591 <i>He wanted it to be<br />a different kind of movie.</i>
1035674 1037593 <i>That had to do with the dialogue too.</i>
1037676 1041638 I think you just can't bear to let<br />a gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
1041722 1045058 I don't know where<br />you get your delusions, laser brain.
1046226 1048312 <i>If you go back<br />and look at the first movie,</i>
1048395 1050563 <i>which to me is the greatest</i> Star Wars...
1050688 1053941 <i>because it was like Picasso-<br />it just broke the mold.</i>
1054025 1059155 <i>But the dialogue<br />is very comic book-like.</i>
1059238 1063242 <i>Very exclamation mark.</i>
1063326 1065036 <i>"Do this! Do that!"</i>
1065119 1068289 <i>Funny. Full of great jokes,</i>
1068372 1071292 <i>combined with the exhilaration<br />of what we were seeing,</i>
1071375 1073711 <i>which no one had ever seen before.</i>
1073794 1077173 <i>It was absolutely exhilarating.<br />The dialogue was funny.</i>
1077256 1079217 <i>I think when we went into</i> Empire,
1079300 1081219 <i>we knew that the dialogue<br />was gonna change</i>
1081302 1082762 <i>in the same way that the movie did.</i>
1082845 1085431 <i>Try to maintain the humor.</i>
1090561 1092438 FISHER:<br /><i>All this was better to play.</i>
1092563 1094232 <i>But I'm telling you,<br />there was some other</i>
1094315 1096192 <i>weird thing going on on the set too.</i>
1096275 1098861 <i>We were divided up soon after this.</i>
1100863 1104158 <i>Harrison and I went off<br />to live in the stomach of another slug.</i>
1104242 1106744 <i>Mark went to hang out with Yoda.</i>
1106827 1112124 <i>So we were separated, and it created-<br />not tension. You were separated.</i>
1112208 1116337 <i>It was just different campus-<br />We were in different classes.</i>
1124387 1127640 KERSHNER: <i>I studied acting<br />after I made my first picture...</i>
1127723 1131060 <i>in order to know<br />what the vernacular of the actor is.</i>
1131143 1133312 <i>I want to know what the actor feels.</i>
1133437 1137149 <i>The insecurity that they feel is terrible.</i>
1137275 1142280 <i>About all a director can do<br />with a good actor is guide them.</i>
1142405 1144615 <i>You're an editor for what they're doing.</i>
1144740 1147159 <i>You are the only audience.</i>
1147243 1152164 <i>I think I can do as well<br />as most directors,</i>
1152248 1155793 <i>so that they can have<br />an exciting performance...</i>
1155876 1158212 <i>that's still a lie, and be believable.</i>
1158296 1160631 <i>That takes a certain amount of ability.</i>
1161299 1163926 HARRISON FORD: <i>I had a very<br />strong relationship with Kershner.</i>
1164010 1166679 <i>We had similar tastes and values,</i>
1166762 1168514 <i>and certainly not similar experience...</i>
1168639 1172685 <i>'cause Kershner's hugely<br />more experienced than I,</i>
1172768 1175354 <i>but he was an actors' director.</i>
1175479 1179442 <i>He liked actors.<br />He enjoyed their process.</i>
1183529 1185781 STEVE GAWLEY:<br /><i>The original opening of Star Wars...</i>
1186282 1189243 <i>had the big Star Destroyer<br />chasing the Rebel Blockade Runner.</i>
1189327 1192955 <i>That model was only three feet long.</i>
1193039 1198252 Empire <i>required that we had to make<br />several versions of the Star Destroyer.</i>
1198336 1201589 <i>A bigger version<br />for some even closer shots...</i>
1201672 1204425 <i>where the detail on the smaller version<br />didn't hold up,</i>
1204508 1206427 <i>so we had to make a bigger version.</i>
1206510 1209972 <i>Then we built<br />a large conning tower section...</i>
1210056 1214852 <i>where Han Solo hid his</i><br />Millennium Falcon <i>on the back of that.</i>
1216520 1218898 KERSHNER:<br /><i>Here's where I had problems.</i>
1219023 1223527 <i>Darth Vader was all black<br />with a black helmet.</i>
1223653 1227698 <i>Sometimes it was very difficult<br />to photograph him.</i>
1227823 1229700 <i>But I had a great cameraman.</i>
1229825 1235247 <i>I had chosen Peter Suschitzky,<br />a Britisher.</i>
1235331 1238250 <i>I had noticed his work before.</i>
1238334 1243254 <i>I don't think he'd ever done a science<br />fiction picture, which was good.</i>
1243338 1246841 <i>This is not science fiction,<br />but it has sort of the feel of it.</i>
1247884 1252347 <i>He just fell into it beautifully<br />and worked very hard.</i>
1254683 1256393 <i>What you'd photograph when you'd see</i>
1256476 1259604 <i>Darth Vader's helmet<br />are only the highlights.</i>
1259688 1261606 <i>The black just disappears.</i>
1261731 1265568 <i>Here we have<br />the power of Darth Vader.</i>
1265694 1267987 WATTS: All <i>Ralph McQuarrie's<br />conceptual drawings</i>
1268071 1270281 <i>were brought over when we began.</i>
1270365 1274244 <i>Darth Vader's pretty much<br />exactly as McQuarrie designed him.</i>
1274327 1278081 <i>The designer was then taking whatever<br />Ralph's conceptuals were...</i>
1278164 1281209 <i>and expanding them<br />into full set designs.</i>
1284170 1286399 Groups Seven and 10<br />will stay behind to fly the speeders.
1286423 1290468 BURTT: <i>There's Joe Johnston<br />in his bit part. Dialogue.</i>
1290552 1295223 <i>He was one of the storyboard artists<br />and conceptual designers on the film.</i>
1295306 1298017 <i>Joe later went on to become a director,</i>
1298101 1301020 <i>doing films like</i> Rocketeer<br /><i>and</i> Jumanji...
1301104 1304274 <i>and</i> Hidalgo, October Sky.
1305567 1308778 KERSHNER: <i>This is our great medical<br />doctor and surgeon-the robot.</i>
1314242 1316327 <i>Here we have the good-bye scene.</i>
1316411 1320540 <i>Of course, oh, yes,<br />Chewbacca does have emotion.</i>
1320623 1326463 <i>He feels love for not his master,<br />but his associate perhaps.</i>
1327088 1331468 <i>Chewbacca's sort of a dog,<br />but he's also part man.</i>
1331551 1335096 <i>They say good-bye not sentimentally.</i>
1335805 1337515 <i>That was important to me.</i>
1337599 1340602 <i>I didn't want to make anything<br />sentimental in the picture.</i>
1340685 1343438 <i>I wanted emotion<br />without sentimentality.</i>
1346691 1351446 <i>Their good-bye is carefully done,<br />let's say.</i>
1352655 1355658 <i>The sets were built very quickly...</i>
1355784 1359621 <i>because we only had seven stages<br />for over 60 sets.</i>
1359746 1363792 <i>My friend Kubrick had burnt down one<br />a couple of weeks before shooting,</i>
1363875 1365794 <i>which made it very difficult.</i>
1365877 1368922 BURTT: <i>The sound of Vader's<br />meditation cube opening...</i>
1369005 1372550 <i>was the sound<br />of the electrical generator...</i>
1372634 1375970 <i>at the air force station on top of<br />Mount Tamalpais in Marin County.</i>
1381810 1383728 <i>We had gone up there one afternoon...</i>
1383853 1385855 <i>and recorded the different motors</i>
1385939 1388775 <i>in the radar dome<br />on the top of that mountain.</i>
1388858 1390610 <i>It's since been dismantled,</i>
1390693 1393238 <i>but it was the sound<br />of the generator starting</i>
1393321 1396574 <i>which we used for the meditation cube.</i>
1396658 1400662 LUCAS: <i>Peter Suschitzky shot this film,<br />and he used a more diffused look.</i>
1400745 1404082 <i>He used a lot of bounce lighting<br />and that sort of thing,</i>
1404165 1406709 <i>which gives it<br />a much more elegant look.</i>
1406793 1411089 <i>It did take a lot more time and cost<br />a lot more money to achieve that.</i>
1411673 1415593 <i>There was a little bit of concern...</i>
1415677 1418763 <i>about getting the film done<br />as a result of the look.</i>
1418888 1422433 <i>But it's a softer look<br />in terms of the lighting.</i>
1426437 1431692 KERSHNER: <i>Here you see the effect<br />of Darth Vader done very subtly.</i>
1432359 1435529 You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
1435612 1437531 <i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>
1438699 1440993 <i>Look at the size of this set.<br />It's huge.</i>
1441076 1443412 <i>And you only see it for a few moments.</i>
1443912 1445706 <i>In fact, for seconds.</i>
1445789 1449376 <i>Because the important thing<br />is what's happening here.</i>
1449960 1452921 <i>Not showing a long shot<br />and staying on it...</i>
1453005 1456758 <i>and seeing all the ships out there<br />and seeing the size.</i>
1456842 1458635 <i>The important thing is this-</i>
1459469 1464808 <i>Princess Leia telling everyone<br />of the dangers...</i>
1464892 1466602 <i>and what they have to do.</i>
1466727 1468812 <i>It shows her as a leader.</i>
1470063 1471940 FISHER:<br /><i>I would like to see the speech again.</i>
1472065 1475444 <i>I know that one part of it was<br />"several ion cannons."</i>
1475569 1477738 <i>Oh! And-</i><br />[LAUGHS]
1477821 1482242 <i>This was like a nightmare when I had<br />these long speeches of horror,</i>
1482826 1485621 <i>and you just had to make it through,<br />'cause they weren't gonna cover.</i>
1485704 1486997 <i>No coverage.</i>
1487080 1488558 <i>You're standing in a group of people,</i>
1488582 1491585 <i>and someone that you will not be<br />introduced to...</i>
1491668 1496673 <i>is going to say some dreck to you<br />that you don't understand.</i>
1496757 1500010 <i>"But what about the shields<br />of the 'krazenlarm'?"</i>
1500093 1503764 <i>"The ion cannons will fire several<br />blasts." That's all I remember.</i>
1503847 1507309 LUCAS: <i>I had pretty much everything<br />I owned already up as collateral.</i>
1507434 1509954 <i>Everything that I had made<br />on</i> American Graffiti <i>and the first film...</i>
1509978 1512147 <i>was reinvested into this film.</i>
1512272 1514274 <i>Naturally I was concerned<br />about the budget.</i>
1515442 1519529 <i>I didn't want to end up losing<br />the whole franchise to a studio...</i>
1519613 1522199 <i>that would just hire<br />whoever they wanted to direct it...</i>
1522282 1524493 <i>and take it in any direction<br />they wanted to take it-</i>
1524576 1526054 <i>not necessarily want to<br />finish the trilogy,</i>
1526078 1528246 <i>but want to turn into something else.</i>
1528330 1530290 <i>By being able to maintain<br />those sequel rights,</i>
1530374 1533877 <i>I was able to maintain<br />and keep the story faithful...</i>
1533961 1536046 <i>to what the original script had been.</i>
1536129 1539216 <i>That was a challenge,<br />'cause there was a lot of pressure...</i>
1539299 1541301 <i>for everybody<br />wanting to control the picture.</i>
1541385 1543553 <i>I was keeping everybody<br />at arm's length,</i>
1543637 1545722 <i>which worked really well<br />for the production itself.</i>
1545806 1549768 <i>Like Kershner-Even though we were<br />close to losing control of the movie...</i>
1550352 1552604 <i>and even though we had a hard time<br />meeting our payroll,</i>
1552688 1555273 <i>I don't think Kershner felt that pressure.</i>
1555357 1557234 <i>The only pressure I put on him was to</i>
1557317 1559403 <i>make the movie as good<br />as he possibly could.</i>
1571123 1574584 DENNIS MUREN:<br /><i>Now we're beginning the big snow battle.</i>
1574668 1576586 <i>When I first came up here from L.A.,</i>
1576670 1578964 <i>when George wanted me<br />to move up to work on the show,</i>
1579047 1582175 <i>Ralph McQuarrie had done a bunch<br />of artwork for the film.</i>
1582259 1585178 <i>The artwork from this sequence<br />was phenomenal.</i>
1585262 1587264 <i>It was like nothing<br />we'd ever seen before.</i>
1587389 1589182 <i>It was one of the big things<br />that made me</i>
1589266 1591476 <i>want to leave my happy home in L.A...</i>
1591560 1594600 <i>and move up to Northern California,<br />and I'm still here after all these years.</i>
1595397 1597607 <i>It was just<br />a great sequence conceptually.</i>
1597733 1602779 <i>The backgrounds we got from Norway<br />for it were spectacular also.</i>
1603363 1606575 <i>It was probably the most difficult<br />sequence in the whole film to do...</i>
1606700 1610537 <i>'cause the light-colored backgrounds<br />that we have to put our models over...</i>
1610662 1615292 <i>don't work nearly as easily as the dark<br />star fields we had in the first</i> Star Wars.
1621756 1624884 BURTT: <i>Taking the artillery thump<br />and the metal shearing machine...</i>
1624967 1627053 <i>and the Dumpster door squeak,</i>
1627136 1629221 <i>I'd build loops out of those sounds...</i>
1629305 1632308 <i>so they would repeat over<br />and over again at a set rhythm,</i>
1632433 1635269 <i>and we could accelerate<br />or de-accelerate the loop...</i>
1635394 1639065 <i>to make the walkers<br />work at different speeds.</i>
1641734 1644904 MUREN: <i>We had to get the movie done,<br />so we went with stop-motion animation.</i>
1644987 1646530 <i>I brought some friends-Jon Berg,</i>
1646614 1649033 <i>Phil Tippett, Tom St Amand,<br />Doug Beswick-</i>
1649116 1652286 <i>friends from L.A. who I'd work with<br />on stop-motion projects up here.</i>
1652411 1655164 <i>I tried to keep away from blue screen</i>
1655247 1656933 <i>as much as we could<br />on the walking machines...</i>
1656957 1660211 <i>so we could do the shots<br />kind of finished through the camera,</i>
1660294 1661480 <i>'cause they were so complicated.</i>
1661504 1664965 <i>There was all sorts of tricky things<br />going on on the set also.</i>
1665049 1669512 <i>We had large sheets of bridal veil<br />material partway into the set...</i>
1669595 1671347 <i>to give a feeling of atmosphere,</i>
1671430 1674558 <i>so one walker machine<br />would be crisp...</i>
1674642 1677645 <i>and the other one behind it would be<br />a little hazy from the atmosphere.</i>
1677770 1681190 <i>Sometimes we shot in smoke<br />to give that atmosphere.</i>
1684026 1686320 LUCAS:<br /><i>A lot of the design work on these films...</i>
1686445 1689240 <i>is just to come up with<br />things that are unique,</i>
1689323 1693994 <i>don't look like things that we've seen,<br />but seem to fit into the situation.</i>
1694078 1697873 <i>Because we have lots of vehicles<br />and creatures and things.</i>
1697957 1701377 <i>It's a struggle to try to create something<br />that's recognizable as what it is,</i>
1701460 1703796 <i>but is something<br />that looks completely different,</i>
1703879 1706924 <i>but not so far out that you can't even<br />comprehend what it is.</i>
1709176 1714223 <i>The idea of giant walking machines<br />wasn't that unusual in science fiction,</i>
1714348 1717810 <i>but it was something that hadn't been<br />seen in the</i> Star Wars <i>world yet.</i>
1717893 1721105 <i>Joe Johnston sat down<br />and did many designs</i>
1721188 1722666 <i>for different kinds of walking machines,</i>
1722690 1725151 <i>and we finally settled on this one.</i>
1726318 1728320 KERSHNER: <i>ILM had a hell of a problem</i>
1728404 1731574 <i>getting this steel cable<br />around the legs...</i>
1731657 1733159 <i>because it's so fine.</i>
1733242 1734451 <i>It's a fine line.</i>
1735452 1737413 MUREN: <i>In this sequence,<br />the backgrounds on this,</i>
1737496 1740257 <i>I think we were on these things<br />for four to six months shooting these.</i>
1740332 1741917 <i>It was a lot of work.</i>
1742001 1745254 <i>You'd spend two or three days<br />getting the shot together,</i>
1745337 1748299 <i>getting the camera programmed<br />to do the right move,</i>
1748382 1751677 <i>and then the actual animation time<br />would be probably a day of shooting it,</i>
1751760 1755347 <i>and you'd find out lots of problems,<br />then a retake the next day to get it.</i>
1755431 1757641 <i>Then we'd shoot<br />all the speeders that have</i>
1757725 1759685 <i>to be shot to go into it<br />and everything like that.</i>
1761103 1765441 <i>Whenever we had an explosion<br />like the walker blowing up like this,</i>
1765566 1766793 <i>that was something that Richard Edlund</i>
1766817 1769737 <i>was involved with<br />and his pyrotechnic crew.</i>
1770279 1772841 <i>We built a larger model for that,<br />instead of our little two-foot ones.</i>
1772865 1775993 <i>We had a five- or six-foot larger one<br />that was made just to blow up...</i>
1776076 1778196 <i>so the scale of the explosion<br />would look a lot better.</i>
1778245 1779997 <i>It was shot at high-speed photography.</i>
1780080 1783584 <i>At that time I think the highest speed<br />camera we were working with here,</i>
1783667 1785628 <i>'cause we were still shooting<br />in VistaVision,</i>
1785711 1787379 <i>was probably 72 frames a second.</i>
1787463 1789632 <i>I don't think we did<br />much higher than that.</i>
1789715 1792801 <i>I don't think we ever went to<br />four-perf very often at least,</i>
1792885 1795971 <i>to shoot anything higher than<br />72 frames a second...</i>
1796055 1800059 <i>which is three times faster than normal,<br />so things appear bigger.</i>
1804104 1805981 <i>All the laser blasts that are in this,</i>
1806065 1808108 <i>tremendous number of effects<br />that are added...</i>
1808234 1810629 <i>even in the live-action scenes,<br />where we're putting these blasts...</i>
1810653 1813821 <i>coming from the different guns<br />and machinery and everything.</i>
1819285 1821537 KERSHNER:<br /><i>We dug these trenches.</i>
1821621 1824832 <i>I came up months<br />before to this glacier...</i>
1825458 1827752 <i>and chose the spot...</i>
1827835 1831089 <i>based on where<br />the sun would be months later.</i>
1831172 1835927 <i>And that's where the men were,<br />in these trenches.</i>
1836010 1838596 <i>I kind of wondered,<br />kind of silly...</i>
1838680 1841849 <i>with all these guns<br />shooting at these great big tanks,</i>
1841975 1843476 <i>but that's what you do.</i>
1843601 1846688 <i>Maybe one shot will get lucky<br />and go through</i>
1846771 1850024 <i>an air-hole or a window or something,</i>
1850108 1851943 <i>because you certainly<br />can't knock them down.</i>
1856656 1859993 MUREN: <i>The approach at the beginning<br />was to do the walkers motion control...</i>
1860076 1862996 <i>to build robotic<br />walking machines on a small scale.</i>
1863079 1866374 <i>That, to me, seemed like it would take<br />up the company and never get done...</i>
1866457 1868459 <i>and jeopardize the release of the film.</i>
1868543 1870712 <i>So I lobbied for<br />and got my approach to it,</i>
1870795 1872439 <i>which was to do it<br />with stop-motion animation...</i>
1872463 1875883 <i>'cause I thought the mechanical look<br />of stop-motion might actually help.</i>
1876009 1879470 <i>That's the first stuff we started with-<br />the walker sequence.</i>
1879554 1882432 <i>We made the walkers the size<br />of a normal stop-motion puppet,</i>
1882515 1884684 <i>which is as big as your hands are.</i>
1884809 1887979 <i>So your hands can get in<br />and, frame at a time, move the figure,</i>
1888062 1889702 <i>step back<br />and shoot another frame of film.</i>
1905997 1908583 LUCAS: <i>There's a battle,<br />but it's a ground battle,</i>
1908666 1911878 <i>and it's at the beginning of the movie,<br />not at the end of the movie,</i>
1911961 1916507 <i>going against traditional<br />storytelling techniques...</i>
1916591 1919677 <i>of putting the big action scene<br />at the end-the big climax at the end.</i>
1921262 1924432 <i>In this film,<br />the climax is a personal climax</i>
1924515 1926225 <i>between Darth Vader and Luke.</i>
1926768 1928688 <i>It involves a sword fight,<br />but it doesn't involve</i>
1928728 1930271 <i>a lot of pyrotechnics and everything.</i>
1933733 1937737 <i>I wanted this sequence<br />to be exciting and unique,</i>
1937862 1941157 <i>but at the same time I didn't want it<br />to overwhelm the ending of the movie.</i>
1943451 1945912 KERSHNER:<br /><i>The second unit, Peter MacDonald,</i>
1945995 1952502 <i>did a great job<br />of doing the explosions after I left,</i>
1952585 1957298 <i>'cause I shot for about 10 days<br />all the actors and the major action,</i>
1957382 1960635 <i>and then he filled in<br />with wonderful things.</i>
1961302 1964055 MUREN: <i>If you look at this,<br />you've got probably 100 or 200 shots...</i>
1964138 1965932 <i>going by in about five or six minutes.</i>
1966057 1969185 <i>It puts you right into<br />the thrill of being there...</i>
1969268 1971979 <i>because they're all<br />so energetic and exciting.</i>
1972647 1975125 <i>For some of these shots where<br />the walkers are of fin the distance,</i>
1975149 1978194 <i>we made a walker<br />that was about two inches tall...</i>
1978277 1980780 <i>that we could shoot when they were<br />supposed to be really tiny,</i>
1980905 1982698 <i>and yet it was still hand-animated.</i>
1982782 1985701 <i>Tiny little moves on that<br />just to get through those shots.</i>
1986202 1990164 BURTT: <i>In these battles, we used<br />a lot of the new pyrotechnic effects...</i>
1990248 1993668 <i>we had recorded<br />at various army bases...</i>
1993751 1996587 <i>in the time that we were out<br />recording prior to</i> Empire.
1996671 2000341 <i>We had recorded pretty much the whole<br />inventory of the United States Army,</i>
2000425 2004428 <i>from small arms<br />up to shoulder-launch missiles,</i>
2004511 2007681 <i>and had gone around the country<br />collecting the different weapon sounds.</i>
2007806 2011768 <i>Then we would rework them and use<br />them for the weapons in this film.</i>
2018608 2020986 FISHER:<br /><i>The call sheet reads: "No dialogue."</i>
2021111 2023613 <i>He's just screaming into a little tube.</i>
2024239 2030912 <i>But I'm just over and over again<br />falling face-first into white dust.</i>
2030996 2034124 <i>Imagine.<br />There's more than one take. Face-first.</i>
2035167 2037169 <i>Okay? Do that a lot.</i>
2037252 2040297 <i>That's your day.<br />"Come on! Here we go!"</i>
2040380 2042549 KERSHNER:<br /><i>Did we know that this would work?</i>
2042632 2045886 <i>Each little piece here I had to guess...</i>
2046011 2049473 <i>and say, "Yep. Let's move on.<br />This is good."</i>
2052517 2056229 <i>I'd say, "Action."<br />Perfect. First shot. Right.</i>
2056354 2058523 <i>Now we do the second shot,</i>
2058648 2060984 <i>and this was much more complicated.</i>
2061485 2065489 <i>Set it up, and we shoot it.</i>
2066156 2067866 <i>And it works.</i>
2067949 2069784 <i>I say, "Cut. Let's move on."</i>
2071203 2074915 <i>The cameraman says,<br />"Don't you want a protection take?"</i>
2074998 2077667 <i>Usually you do a second take<br />if there's a lot</i>
2077751 2080086 <i>of people and a lot of things happening.</i>
2080170 2083423 <i>I said,<br />"No. Why? Was something wrong?"</i>
2083924 2087761 <i>This I had already set up for myself.</i>
2087844 2090597 <i>"You said everything was ready.</i>
2090680 2092849 <i>I shot it. It's good for me."</i>
2093600 2095060 <i>"Well-</i>
2096394 2099231 <i>A protection take.<br />Usually if something is wrong"-</i>
2099356 2103068 <i>I said,<br />"I can't afford a protection take.</i>"
2103193 2107656 <i>This picture will take years to make<br />because of all the setting up...</i>
2107739 2110283 <i>"and all the intricate things<br />that have to be done."</i>
2110992 2115080 <i>I said, "That was a good take.<br />Next scene." We moved.</i>
2115163 2120335 <i>Once the crew realized<br />that I would do single takes,</i>
2121211 2124381 <i>they never again asked<br />for a protection take...</i>
2124464 2128385 <i>and made sure when they said,<br />"We're ready," they were ready.</i>
2128468 2132138 <i>No more fiddling with lights<br />and with gadgets.</i>
2132222 2134349 <i>That saved me a lot of time...</i>
2134432 2139187 <i>because the idea was<br />if a shot didn't work,</i>
2139271 2142440 <i>then either a piece of it would work...</i>
2142566 2145318 <i>or we'd go back at the end of the week-</i>
2145402 2147529 <i>the sets would be gone by then-</i>
2147612 2150115 <i>and build a little piece...</i>
2150198 2154160 <i>and try to do something<br />that fit into that area...</i>
2154244 2155564 <i>to that part that you don't have.</i>
2156079 2158415 <i>Never had to do it.</i>
2162711 2164981 LUCAS: <i>When we'd have problems,<br />we could sit down and say,</i>
2165005 2167090 <i>"How are we gonna solve this problem?</i>
2167173 2170760 <i>We got a thing here.<br />What can we do to streamline things?"</i>
2170844 2172596 <i>There was always a lot of cooperation.</i>
2172679 2174764 <i>We were working<br />very closely together...</i>
2174848 2178810 <i>to overcome the obstacles<br />that were slowing us down...</i>
2178935 2181271 <i>or causing difficulty.</i>
2182147 2184983 <i>This ended up being<br />about a $30 million picture...</i>
2185108 2187944 <i>whereas</i> Star Wars <i>was only 13.</i>
2189821 2191406 <i>Those things are always a challenge,</i>
2191489 2193949 <i>'cause for a director,<br />what you're trying to do...</i>
2194033 2196368 <i>is do the best possible job<br />at telling the story.</i>
2196452 2201790 <i>Kersh had some hurdles<br />that the story was a continuation.</i>
2201874 2206128 <i>It was a connector between two other<br />films, and we talked about that.</i>
2206920 2210799 <i>He knew that. In a lot of the cases<br />he knew he couldn't end it,</i>
2212176 2214720 <i>or he knew there wasn't an arc<br />that was gonna end this thing...</i>
2214803 2217640 <i>that he could deal with and say,<br />"This is how I'm gonna build this,"</i>
2217723 2220100 <i>because the final chapter<br />wasn't out there yet.</i>
2220184 2222645 <i>He had a vague idea<br />of where the final chapter was going,</i>
2222728 2227483 <i>but the specifics<br />I hadn't really put down on paper yet.</i>
2228734 2231528 <i>That was his challenge,<br />was try to do a better job.</i>
2231654 2234782 <i>I think it is. It's a more elegant movie<br />than the first one.</i>
2237493 2239304 MUREN: <i>This is the asteroid sequence<br />coming up.</i>
2239328 2242539 <i>This was the first sequence<br />that I started shooting on the show.</i>
2242623 2245084 <i>I started shooting<br />with little stand-in models...</i>
2245167 2247836 <i>'cause we didn't have the real</i><br />Millennium Falcon <i>made yet.</i>
2247920 2249672 <i>We had a smaller</i> Falcon<br /><i>made for the show</i>
2249755 2251435 <i>that we could maneuver<br />to do this sequence.</i>
2251548 2253425 <i>It was probably about two feet across...</i>
2253509 2256309 <i>as opposed to the five- or six-foot one<br />that we had for the first show.</i>
2264520 2267606 LUCAS: <i>I love this sequence<br />with Han Solo in the asteroid field.</i>
2267690 2270359 <i>It's one of my favorite sequences.</i>
2271026 2274196 <i>Visually it's very exciting,<br />and it's got a lot of humor.</i>
2274279 2277574 <i>At the same time, the music<br />and the sound effects fit in very well.</i>
2277658 2282705 <i>To me, it's a very successful marriage<br />of soundtrack and of visuals.</i>
2282788 2285165 <i>And it manages to create<br />a lot of tension.</i>
2285874 2287584 <i>And it's funny.</i>
2296635 2298971 MUREN: <i>Conceptually,<br />this was a difficult sequence...</i>
2299096 2300848 <i>because with all these rocks out there,</i>
2300931 2303410 <i>you couldn't really tell what goes up,<br />what goes down, or anything.</i>
2303434 2306520 <i>I came up with the idea of adding<br />this asteroid belt in the background,</i>
2306603 2311108 <i>that sort of the planet Saturn<br />has a belt on it...</i>
2311233 2313944 <i>that gives you an idea of what is up<br />and what is down.</i>
2314486 2317698 <i>Sort of a horizon line.<br />That's throughout this whole sequence.</i>
2317781 2320451 <i>That orients you to where you are,</i>
2320576 2324329 <i>which helps you understand spatially<br />where all the rocks are moving...</i>
2324413 2326474 <i>and what the ships are doing<br />and everything like that.</i>
2326498 2328292 <i>It gives a nice graphic to the shot too.</i>
2330711 2332629 <i>The asteroid elements, most of these...</i>
2332713 2335674 <i>are made up of Styrofoam<br />and covered with plaster...</i>
2335758 2338969 <i>and motion controlled-<br />moving by the camera</i>
2339052 2341180 <i>one frame at a time, pre-programmed...</i>
2341263 2342765 <i>and doing it dozens of times</i>
2342848 2344648 <i>and putting it together<br />and you have one shot.</i>
2346977 2350314 <i>It was an awful lot of work<br />in all these separate elements.</i>
2350439 2352816 <i>There were middle ground<br />asteroid ones that we made-</i>
2352941 2356820 <i>little rocks about a half an inch<br />are tied on little strings...</i>
2356945 2359698 <i>and moved by themselves back there<br />and comped in.</i>
2359782 2362242 <i>So you had different scales of rocks.</i>
2397735 2402323 KERSHNER: <i>I think this is one of the best<br />special effects shots in the film,</i>
2403366 2406494 <i>where it makes this turn.</i>
2406577 2408496 <i>It goes through here...</i>
2408579 2410998 <i>and then comes into this little valley...</i>
2414502 2418256 <i>and does this move...</i>
2418339 2420550 <i>which is an upside-down move.</i>
2422343 2427390 <i>Goes into the hole,<br />where they think it's a big cave.</i>
2427515 2430393 <i>It is a cave,<br />but they don't know what's inside.</i>
2439026 2440611 LUCAS:<br /><i>Saturday matinee serials-</i>
2440695 2445324 <i>the love story is much more like it is<br />in Episode IV, V and VI.</i>
2446033 2449996 <i>Because Episodes I, II and III<br />is a backstory.</i>
2450079 2452164 <i>It has a tendency to be more involved in</i>
2452248 2454500 <i>developing characters<br />and developing plots.</i>
2454584 2458713 <i>This is telling a story. That's just<br />telling where the story came from.</i>
2458796 2464468 <i>And it does put a big shift away from<br />the plot and onto the characters.</i>
2464552 2467930 <i>Usually backstory is laying out<br />who the characters are,</i>
2468055 2470242 <i>what their problems are<br />and how they got to be where they are,</i>
2470266 2472560 <i>as opposed to telling a particular story,</i>
2472643 2476230 <i>and that's the shift<br />between this trilogy and the first trilogy.</i>
2476314 2480151 <i>The first trilogy's about the father.<br />This trilogy is about the son.</i>
2480234 2483654 <i>Even though it's a continuing story<br />that follows the family saga,</i>
2483738 2487491 <i>it does break down to one's<br />the father story and one's the son story.</i>
2495666 2498836 MARK HAMILL: <i>The movies were,<br />he said, "structured like an opera."</i>
2498920 2501255 <i>Act two is always tragic.</i>
2502256 2505843 <i>The heroes are thwarted,<br />and it ends with tragedy.</i>
2507845 2512433 <i>So usually act two<br />is the most action-packed, interesting,</i>
2512516 2518356 <i>unresolved act of a three-act play.</i>
2523653 2526089 KURTZ: <i>I'm not a big fan<br />of shooting actors against blue screen...</i>
2526113 2527615 <i>and then putting in everything later,</i>
2527698 2530135 <i>'cause they get to the point where they<br />don't know what's happening.</i>
2530159 2534038 <i>Anything you can do to support the<br />actors and having the set be there...</i>
2534121 2538376 <i>so that they have a feel for what<br />the atmosphere is like is very helpful.</i>
2538459 2541128 <i>We built the whole swamp<br />because it worked better that way...</i>
2541212 2544173 <i>than trying to build part of it,<br />a few shots,</i>
2544256 2546217 <i>and then blue screen all the rest.</i>
2546300 2549720 KERSHNER: <i>I think Peter Suschitzky<br />did a great job of lighting here,</i>
2549804 2552324 <i>because you have to ask yourself,<br />where's the light coming from?</i>
2552348 2555226 <i>We kept the lights on on the ship.</i>
2555351 2559063 <i>Plus the ambient light<br />gave us a reason for the close-ups...</i>
2559146 2561857 <i>so we could see the faces,</i>
2561983 2565403 <i>or you wouldn't be able to see it<br />with ambient light alone.</i>
2565486 2566862 <i>It wouldn't be bright enough.</i>
2566946 2569991 <i>So I kept the lights on<br />on the ship in the water.</i>
2570074 2572576 <i>The water was only about<br />three-and-a-half feet deep...</i>
2572660 2575870 <i>with frogmen underneath<br />keeping the ship in place...</i>
2575954 2578623 <i>and doing all the stuff<br />that you're going to see.</i>
2578707 2580083 <i>He made it.</i>
2580166 2582627 <i>Now he's swimming to shore.</i>
2582711 2585422 <i>There's still contact<br />between the two of them.</i>
2585547 2588925 <i>I think Mark is an incredible actor,<br />by the way-</i>
2589009 2591094 <i>the way he got into this thing...</i>
2591177 2596850 <i>and made everything totally believable<br />for himself and for me.</i>
2596933 2598393 <i>There we are.</i>
2598518 2600395 <i>Oh, my gosh. Isn't that awful?</i>
2600520 2602856 <i>There's a monster under there.</i>
2602939 2605066 <i>We can't tell how big yet,</i>
2605191 2612157 <i>but the fact that it can swallow-Oop!-<br />R2-D2 means that it must be pretty big.</i>
2613742 2616619 <i>One bubble means trouble.</i>
2616703 2618788 [CHUCKLING]
2619456 2623293 <i>All these little devices,<br />like a bubble here or there-</i>
2623376 2627881 <i>and the regurgitation here-</i>
2629132 2633636 <i>We don't know. Either it was<br />regurgitation or it was a little rocket...</i>
2633762 2636598 <i>that R2-D2 sets off.</i>
2636723 2638516 <i>It doesn't matter.</i>
2638600 2640935 <i>It happens, and that's what matters.</i>
2641061 2642854 <i>He's free.</i>
2642937 2645106 <i>Of course he's got slime all over him.</i>
2645231 2647525 <i>If you were in a monster's mouth<br />and a stomach,</i>
2647609 2649986 <i>you'd have slime all over you too.</i>
2650070 2652864 <i>It's a wonder the metal doesn't fatigue.</i>
2654699 2658828 <i>I wanted him to also spit up<br />a lot of the mud and water.</i>
2660997 2662499 <i>So we had arranged for that.</i>
2662582 2667921 <i>Everything has to be arranged before<br />you get on the set, or it won't happen...</i>
2668004 2672258 <i>with a little blurpy sound,<br />thanks to Burtt.</i>
2679307 2682352 BURTT: <i>The sound of Vader's helmet<br />being locked on to his head...</i>
2682477 2685063 <i>was produced by putting one's hand</i>
2685146 2687649 <i>over the end<br />of a vacuum cleaner pipe...</i>
2687774 2690318 <i>while the pipe was sucking in the dirt.</i>
2690443 2691683 <i>When you put your hand over it,</i>
2691736 2693256 <i>it would make<br />a sudden "thunk" sound...</i>
2693321 2695323 <i>as your hand went<br />over the end of the pipe.</i>
2695406 2699577 <i>That became what was used for<br />Vader's helmet locking onto his head.</i>
2702539 2706000 KERSHNER:<br /><i>Just that second and a half of his head-</i>
2706084 2708253 <i>Was it a head? Or what was it?</i>
2708336 2710130 <i>Was it a brain? You couldn't tell.</i>
2710213 2713883 <i>I never wanted to show<br />too much of Darth Vader.</i>
2713967 2719180 <i>This was the only time<br />you saw anything of him real.</i>
2719305 2721933 <i>This was a set that I particularly liked.</i>
2722016 2725854 <i>It was where Darth Vader<br />spent his time.</i>
2729899 2732193 BURTT: <i>Recordings that we did<br />in the train yard</i>
2732277 2734237 <i>of cars being banged into one another...</i>
2734320 2736906 <i>were used for the</i> Millennium Falcon
2736990 2739617 <i>lurching back and forth<br />while it's in the cave.</i>
2741244 2744747 FISHER: <i>Actually, this might be<br />some leaning acting.</i>
2744831 2749085 <i>I'm not positive<br />if they moved the thing or had us lean.</i>
2749169 2755258 <i>I'm always doing these incredible jobs<br />with wrenches and things, fixing.</i>
2755341 2759053 Captain, being held by you<br />isn't quite enough to get me excited.
2759179 2760430 Sorry, sweetheart.
2760555 2764184 <i>This is where it started, the prissy</i>
2764267 2767728 <i>"you're taking up a lot of my time"<br />Princess Leia.</i>
2767853 2769053 <i>I am playing this character...</i>
2769354 2772524 <i>and this is how I'm considered to be.</i>
2772608 2775277 <i>Maybe this is what I'm like,<br />and I cannot believe it,</i>
2775360 2780490 <i>but it certainly isn't a reach for me<br />to play it, and it's devastating.</i>
2781700 2784870 <i>They had me play myself.</i>
2784953 2787706 <i>They had me play<br />Carrie Fisher like that.</i>
2793545 2796381 HAMILL: <i>I was the only human being<br />on the call sheet for months.</i>
2796465 2800010 <i>You'd go to lunch and see Billy Dee</i>
2800093 2801678 <i>and the other characters<br />running around,</i>
2801762 2804014 <i>and it was very separate.</i>
2804097 2808060 <i>Then I'd hear stories, "They're up in the</i><br />Millennium Falcon <i>doing this and that."</i>
2808143 2810687 <i>It was very episodic.</i>
2810771 2814524 <i>When we went<br />to Tunisia in the first one,</i>
2814608 2818570 <i>Tony Daniels and I were able<br />to really bond very strongly...</i>
2818654 2822824 <i>because that was<br />almost like a whole separate movie.</i>
2822908 2826495 <i>We kept following<br />the</i> Jesus of Nazareth <i>crew around.</i>
2826578 2830749 <i>I kept thinking,<br />"All the glamor of the fourth century."</i>
2835671 2838757 LUCAS: <i>I had to come up with another<br />Jedi-I had killed Ben off-</i>
2838840 2842552 <i>who was older and wiser<br />and shorter than Ben, to train Luke.</i>
2842636 2844805 <i>That was the beginning<br />premise of Yoda,</i>
2844930 2848183 <i>and I decided I wanted something<br />very small and very unassuming...</i>
2848308 2850727 <i>and very wizened and old<br />and that sort of thing.</i>
2850811 2852646 <i>I worked with Joe Johnston,</i>
2852771 2854523 <i>who was my chief designer<br />at that point,</i>
2854606 2855857 <i>along with Ralph McQuarrie.</i>
2855941 2857734 <i>I actually gave them both<br />the assignment.</i>
2857818 2863073 <i>I said, "I want a three-foot-high<br />wizened little gnome-like creature."</i>
2863198 2865951 <i>And they started drawing<br />various pictures of it as I was writing it.</i>
2866034 2868834 <i>I would say, "I want this one,<br />I don't want this one, make him taller."</i>
2868912 2870392 <i>There's a whole series of drawings...</i>
2870455 2873542 <i>of the way he's evolved<br />into what he actually is today.</i>
2881216 2884511 <i>But the essence of the fact<br />that he was this super, master teacher,</i>
2884636 2887222 <i>sort of the ultimate Ben Kenobi,<br />stayed there.</i>
2887347 2889975 <i>We have green versions<br />and blue versions</i>
2890058 2891452 <i>and all different kinds<br />of versions of him...</i>
2891476 2895022 <i>before I finally picked and evolved<br />the version that we've got now.</i>
2895147 2901028 <i>I was using Alec and the Ben Kenobi<br />character as the chief influence.</i>
2901111 2902946 <i>"I said," I want something like this with</i>
2903030 2904990 <i>the same power<br />and the same strength."</i>
2905115 2908327 <i>We then tried to transfer into a puppet.</i>
2914082 2915917 JOE JOHNSTON: <i>No one ever said,</i>
2916001 2917669 <i>"Here's what Yoda has to be."</i>
2917753 2919755 <i>Yoda could be anything.</i>
2919838 2925135 <i>We gravitated toward combining<br />a leprechaun and a troll and a gnome...</i>
2925218 2929306 <i>and giving him this quality<br />of being very wise.</i>
2929389 2932893 <i>I think the one thing I remember George<br />saying was that he's 400 years old.</i>
2936355 2937939 STUART FREEBORN: <i>He showed me</i>
2938023 2939274 <i>the original sketches.</i>
2939358 2944988 <i>I thought, "That's interesting there,<br />but I want something in more depth."</i>
2945072 2947574 <i>I looked in the mirror and I thought,</i>
2947657 2951328 <i>"There's something perhaps<br />a little bit amusing about my face.</i>
2951411 2953080 <i>I could get that in."</i>
2953163 2955331 <i>So I modeled something of myself.</i>
2955414 2958709 <i>I thought, "Now I've got to make him<br />look intelligent."</i>
2958793 2963964 <i>I'd been collecting photographs<br />of famous people for quite a few years,</i>
2964048 2965883 <i>and I got Einstein.</i>
2965966 2968844 <i>Everybody knows Einstein<br />and knows he's got</i>
2968928 2971305 <i>a lot of wrinkles that people remember.</i>
2971430 2974517 <i>On top of what I'd roughly done<br />of myself,</i>
2974600 2978437 <i>I then put the Einstein wrinkles<br />in all around.</i>
2981232 2983734 <i>Einstein's got a mustache.</i>
2983818 2989365 <i>All I did was model his lip up a little bit<br />and then put wrinkles in it...</i>
2989448 2993035 <i>that could be similar<br />to the mustache that Einstein had.</i>
2993119 2996956 <i>But it was still a lip.<br />It was half-and-half.</i>
2997039 3001752 <i>There are all the rest of the lines<br />that associate with intelligence,</i>
3001836 3004255 <i>not really knowing<br />that they'd seen something similar...</i>
3004338 3007091 <i>they know associate<br />with high intelligence.</i>
3007174 3011095 <i>It seemed to work more than I ever<br />thought it would, but it did somehow.</i>
3011178 3012680 <i>That was Yoda.</i>
3014974 3017810 DANIELS: <i>One of the very difficult<br />things for me filming...</i>
3017935 3019895 <i>was that we'd be in the middle of a shot,</i>
3019979 3023149 <i>and suddenly George<br />would say, "His eyes went out,"</i>
3023232 3024859 <i>with anger, and he'd come up.</i>
3024942 3028446 <i>"Yeah. They're out."<br />I'm right behind those eyes.</i>
3028529 3031407 <i>He's looking right at me,<br />saying, "You screwed up."</i>
3033325 3037621 <i>Or the wonderful scene<br />where Han Solo's</i>
3037705 3039999 <i>about to kiss Princess Leia<br />for the first time...</i>
3040082 3042793 <i>and 3PO rushes in there,<br />"Pardon me, sir."</i>
3042877 3049467 <i>As I did that, I heard and felt something<br />fell off and crash to the floor.</i>
3049550 3052386 <i>You're there, and you just don't want<br />to do things again all the time,</i>
3052511 3054221 <i>and we didn't do it again.</i>
3054346 3057600 <i>But if you slow that bit down<br />and go through frame by frame,</i>
3057683 3059185 <i>you will see an arm greeblie.</i>
3059310 3060603 <i>It had fallen off.</i>
3060686 3063189 <i>But it goes so fast, and you don't see it</i>
3063272 3065816 <i>unless you go delicately<br />frame by frame.</i>
3069195 3071822 BURTT: <i>When you work on a film<br />like this in the editing room,</i>
3071906 3074658 <i>you're forced to listen to<br />every bit of dialogue</i>
3074742 3076410 <i>over and over and over again...</i>
3076494 3079788 <i>as you go through the inner workings<br />of a scene and putting it together.</i>
3079872 3083292 <i>You often go home<br />with these lines stuck in your head.</i>
3083375 3087087 <i>I can remember this line,<br />"My hands are dirty too."</i>
3087171 3089256 <i>Everyone on the crew picked up<br />on that line,</i>
3089340 3092551 <i>and you'd hear it right and left<br />from members of the crew.</i>
3092676 3095513 <i>We'd be at lunch,<br />and the conversation would end...</i>
3095596 3098390 <i>with somebody saying,<br />"My hands are dirty too" -</i>
3098516 3100976 <i>all taken from this moment<br />with Han Solo.</i>
3101060 3102186 My hands are dirty.
3102269 3104480 My hands are dirty too.<br />What are you afraid of?
3104563 3105606 Afraid?
3105689 3108234 KERSHNER: <i>Look at the look<br />on her face. It's beautiful.</i>
3108359 3112112 <i>He is so pushy, isn't he?</i>
3112196 3114907 <i>He's very masculine, Han Solo.</i>
3114990 3117368 <i>She resists to the end,</i>
3117451 3121413 <i>but when she leaves, it's not a smile.</i>
3121497 3126418 <i>He's pretty unhappy, because he was<br />getting somewhere with Princess Leia.</i>
3129213 3133092 <i>He represents every young man<br />who's been in this situation.</i>
3140057 3144395 FISHER: <i>It's George's vision,<br />and Kersh was able to service that-</i>
3144478 3150191 <i>was able to absolutely see<br />what he wanted to do and deliver that.</i>
3150275 3152944 <i>It's not easy to do that.</i>
3153027 3155363 <i>People would get in the way of it.</i>
3155446 3157490 <i>Kersh really understood it...</i>
3157574 3163621 <i>and was able to even deepen the<br />spirituality, if there is such a thing in it,</i>
3163705 3166499 <i>and there was-</i>
3166583 3172672 <i>the whole mythological content of it<br />and the relationships.</i>
3172755 3176217 <i>Ultimately, if that doesn't work,</i>
3176301 3181264 <i>then the film isn't as interesting,<br />even if it does have all that spectacle.</i>
3188021 3190607 KERSHNER:<br /><i>You have to keep Darth Vader alive,</i>
3190690 3194736 <i>and he has to be a constant threat.</i>
3195528 3197697 <i>Everyone's afraid of him.</i>
3197780 3201868 <i>Our principals<br />are way down in the hole,</i>
3201951 3208875 <i>and here is Darth Vader talking<br />to the big cheese himself, the Emperor.</i>
3214714 3217759 BURTT: <i>The only thing that's changed<br />in this movie in the DVD...</i>
3217842 3220511 <i>is the scene between<br />Vader and the Emperor.</i>
3220637 3222930 <i>At this point, it's a different actor.</i>
3223014 3226351 <i>They've since now photographed Ian<br />McDiarmid who played the Emperor.</i>
3226476 3228978 <i>He's been placed into those scenes.</i>
3229062 3231648 <i>There's a little bit of change<br />in dialogue there.</i>
3231731 3235318 <i>But it was mainly to get consistency<br />with the look and sound of the Emperor.</i>
3235401 3238196 <i>In the original</i> Empire Strikes Back,
3238279 3242116 <i>it was a different voice,<br />and he had different eyes,</i>
3242200 3244118 <i>and it was a different face<br />of the Emperor.</i>
3244202 3248373 <i>That's now been made consistent<br />with the other films.</i>
3250458 3253503 <i>The other change they have made<br />is to change the voice of Boba Fett,</i>
3253586 3258925 <i>once again using the actor<br />that played him in</i> Attack of the Clones.
3261177 3263346 [THUNDER RUMBLING]
3265932 3270937 <i>A lot of the thunder that's part<br />of the atmosphere in Dagobah...</i>
3271020 3273272 <i>are actual thunder recordings which we</i>
3273356 3277068 <i>purchased from a man<br />named Tad Staples.</i>
3277151 3281280 <i>Tad has devoted his life<br />to recording thunder.</i>
3281364 3285118 <i>He has done it for 30-some years.</i>
3285201 3290331 <i>Tad is blind and spends<br />almost all of his time...</i>
3290415 3293042 <i>in a world in which sound<br />means everything to him.</i>
3293126 3298297 <i>He grew up in the Midwest where there<br />were thunderstorms in Indiana.</i>
3298423 3301426 <i>I saw an interview with him once<br />on</i> The Today Show,
3301551 3304387 <i>because he's quite knowledgeable<br />about the sound of thunder,</i>
3304470 3306472 <i>having recorded so many storms.</i>
3306556 3311018 <i>I got in touch with him,<br />invited him out to California...</i>
3311102 3313271 <i>back about the time that</i> Empire<br /><i>was made.</i>
3313396 3316816 <i>As part of that acquaintance with him,</i>
3316899 3320236 <i>we obtained many<br />of his thunder recordings...</i>
3320319 3324782 <i>which we used over the years<br />for thunder in these films.</i>
3330204 3333499 FRANK OZ: <i>It was Kersh who<br />directed it, and he did a magnificent job.</i>
3333583 3340172 <i>He really was very instrumental in how<br />Yoda was first shown to the public.</i>
3340255 3344259 <i>He was the one who really pushed for<br />that impishness there in the beginning.</i>
3344342 3347220 <i>He deserves a lot of credit for</i> Empire,
3347304 3349064 <i>and George knows that.<br />He's always said that.</i>
3349139 3353769 <i>He also deserves credit for Yoda<br />and how Yoda was first presented.</i>
3357105 3359775 KERSHNER:<br /><i>I think this is the first time in film...</i>
3359858 3366323 <i>that a puppet made out of plastic,<br />rubber, electronics, wire pulling,</i>
3367115 3370035 <i>is made to be actually alive.</i>
3385675 3387594 <i>It is not considered a puppet.</i>
3387677 3390764 <i>You don't think of it as a puppet.<br />You think of it as alive.</i>
3390847 3395018 <i>I wanted it to be able to eat.</i>
3395143 3401900 <i>It can't show emotion, except for the<br />ears moving and the brow furrowing.</i>
3401983 3406738 <i>That's the only thing<br />that shows emotion, and the voice.</i>
3406822 3410367 <i>Frank Oz,<br />who was part of the Henson team,</i>
3410450 3412911 <i>was creating the voice of Yoda.</i>
3412994 3415038 <i>We had a good time with that.</i>
3416331 3419584 <i>Frank is a very wonderful person<br />to work with.</i>
3421670 3428635 <i>Every set with Yoda is about five and<br />a half feet off the floor of the stage,</i>
3428718 3433265 <i>with holes cut in the stage<br />where Yoda would stand.</i>
3433390 3435976 <i>It's always done with hands coming up</i>
3436059 3439396 <i>and wires being pulled<br />and the eyes moving.</i>
3439479 3443608 <i>Mark, in doing the scenes with him,<br />is doing something really remarkable.</i>
3443692 3447320 <i>He can't hear anything that Yoda says.</i>
3456204 3459457 <i>But it's the scene that makes him alive.</i>
3464963 3467048 BURTT:<br /><i>Another rule in sound mixing...</i>
3467132 3469426 <i>is that if you want something<br />to sound loud,</i>
3469551 3475098 <i>then it's best to precede it by some<br />silence in a very quiet scene...</i>
3475223 3477350 <i>such that the impact<br />of something coming in</i>
3477434 3479811 <i>suddenly can have<br />all the greater contrast.</i>
3479895 3482814 <i>This was what was done<br />in the scene with the mynocks...</i>
3482898 3485191 <i>appearing on the outside<br />of the spaceship...</i>
3485275 3488194 <i>and jumping onto the windshield<br />to scare everyone.</i>
3488278 3491990 <i>If you'll notice, the soundtrack gets<br />very quiet and almost down to nothing...</i>
3492073 3496953 <i>prior to that moment when the sound<br />leaps out at you along with the visual.</i>
3497037 3498455 [SQUEALING]
3498538 3499873 Aah!
3501166 3503418 FISHER: <i>It's tough.<br />You have to really concentrate.</i>
3503501 3508673 <i>They'll say to you, "The mynocks<br />are gonna be outside the window."</i>

4491524 4493776 <i>When you get deeper<br />into looking at them,</i>
4493860 4495462 <i>it's just some odd<br />little greeblie things...</i>
4495486 4497864 <i>that your mind fills in<br />as to being functional.</i>
4505830 4510126 <i>Because the stage we were shooting on<br />in Northern California was not very big,</i>
4510251 4512295 <i>the size of the models<br />could never be very big.</i>
4512420 4516090 <i>Our shooting stage was only<br />probably about 50 or 60 feet long...</i>
4516174 4519886 <i>and maybe 20 feet wide, and we had<br />other stuff shooting in there also.</i>
4519969 4523723 <i>So we couldn't make very big models<br />like we do today or like we did on</i> Jedi.
4523806 4527435 <i>Lando's not a system.<br />He's a man. Lando Calrissian.</i>
4527518 4529812 <i>Cardplayer, gambler.</i>
4529896 4532565 -A scoundrel. You'd like him.<br />-Thanks.
4533608 4536110 FISHER: <i>I like that.<br />I like that he embarrassed me.</i>
4536194 4538196 <i>That was my character then.</i>
4538279 4540490 <i>I liked working with him.</i>
4540573 4542575 <i>We had fun.</i>
4542659 4546204 <i>This is pleasant between us.</i>
4546287 4548289 <i>That was nice.</i>
4548373 4550124 <i>That never happened.</i>
4550208 4554128 <i>But it happens again and again<br />a little bit from now on.</i>
4554671 4559258 <i>I say to him, "You're not as bad as I<br />thought," or some dribble like that.</i>
4559342 4560969 <i>I do kiss him.</i>
4561052 4563596 <i>I kiss Cuddles.</i><br />[CHUCKLES]
4563680 4565306 You do have your moments.
4565974 4568893 Not many of them,<br />but you do have them.
4572397 4574857 BURTT: <i>A lot of the mechanical sounds<br />in this film...</i>
4574983 4579237 <i>such as the</i> Millennium Falcon<br /><i>detaching from the Star Destroyer...</i>
4579320 4581322 <i>as it drifts off with the space junk...</i>
4581406 4585410 <i>were recorded on board<br />the aircraft carrier</i> USS Constellation.
4585493 4588079 <i>We sent a two-man crew out there...</i>
4588162 4590832 <i>to record the sounds<br />of jets landing and taking off...</i>
4590915 4593334 <i>and all the mechanics<br />on board the aircraft carrier.</i>
4593418 4596546 <i>The elevators, the catapults,<br />the mechanisms</i>
4596629 4598506 <i>for stowing the aircraft, the motors...</i>
4598589 4600258 <i>and all of those sounds...</i>
4600842 4602762 <i>that are only heard<br />on board an aircraft carrier.</i>
4609684 4611894 LUCAS:<br /><i>There's a lot of similarities sometimes...</i>
4611978 4616065 <i>with what Anakin Skywalker would say<br />and what Luke Skywalker says...</i>
4616149 4622447 <i>to keep the idea or the theme moving<br />in terms of how their stories progress.</i>
4623197 4625158 <i>It's the same thing with Obi-Wan.</i>
4625241 4629454 <i>There's a lot of reminiscent things<br />going on between the two films.</i>
4629537 4632749 <i>Different harmonics,<br />but it's the same piece of music.</i>
4648097 4650016 BURTT:<br /><i>The favorite phase of the movie...</i>
4650099 4652018 <i>is when you're there at a moment when</i>
4652101 4654604 <i>something really comes alive<br />for the first time.</i>
4654687 4658232 <i>That happens more than once<br />in the making of a film.</i>
4658357 4660985 <i>There's the first time that a scene gets</i>
4661069 4663279 <i>cut together,<br />and you see it as an editor.</i>
4663362 4668534 <i>It's very hard to evaluate the success<br />of the editing in these films...</i>
4668618 4670828 <i>until you've put some sound in...</i>
4670952 4673830 <i>and can screen the film<br />with the sound being there...</i>
4673914 4677459 <i>to give it a sense<br />of naturalness and credibility.</i>
4678460 4685133 <i>Sound extends the credibility<br />of the world there in the image.</i>
4685258 4688470 <i>It fixes it in a place.<br />It gives it a context.</i>
4688595 4693642 <i>There's always been a lot of effort put<br />into always doing temporary mixes...</i>
4693725 4696686 <i>as we go along<br />in the post-production process.</i>
4696770 4699165 <i>The first assembly of the film,<br />they'll have temporary sound.</i>
4699189 4702317 <i>They'll have temporary music,<br />maybe temporary dialogue.</i>
4702400 4705487 <i>But it's also great, because you<br />can experiment with sounds...</i>
4706029 4708448 <i>during those temp mixes.</i>
4713870 4717707 KERSHNER: <i>Meanwhile,<br />here is the</i> Millennium Falcon
4717791 4718792 <i>coming to Cloud City.</i>
4719501 4724297 <i>We heard about this friend of his<br />who he thinks will help them,</i>
4724381 4726883 <i>'cause the ship needs a little work.</i>
4726967 4731388 <i>But right now<br />it's an unfriendly entrance into the area.</i>
4731471 4733849 <i>They're being followed and shot at.</i>
4736059 4740063 <i>This is one of the great shots of ILM<br />where it goes into and out of the cloud.</i>
4740147 4742732 <i>It's wonderful what they did.</i>
4746319 4747904 MUREN: <i>In the background, you'll see</i>
4747988 4749507 <i>little guys turning<br />their heads sometimes...</i>
4749531 4752742 <i>in some of the models<br />in the accompanying spacecraft.</i>
4752868 4756329 <i>See the little guys turning and looking?<br />The back spaceships.</i>
4756413 4760167 <i>There's lots of details like that that we<br />put into these models when we could...</i>
4760250 4761710 <i>to help show the scale of them,</i>
4761835 4763753 <i>if you could actually see<br />people inside of them.</i>
4763879 4768675 <i>This massive city floating in the clouds,<br />a very tough sequence to work on.</i>
4770177 4774556 <i>If you look at the ideas here, this could<br />never have been done before-</i>
4774681 4779060 <i>the idea of a city with lots of futuristic<br />buildings all jammed together,</i>
4779144 4782480 <i>really deco-ey designs,<br />really nice-looking.</i>
4782564 4785150 <i>It's been copied in<br />so many films since then.</i>
4785233 4786633 <i>This was probably the first time...</i>
4786776 4788320 <i>that it'd really been done...</i>
4788403 4791990 <i>with this density and futuristic look<br />and everything that I can think of.</i>
4792073 4795035 <i>It was really quite remarkable<br />in the design of it,</i>
4795118 4797037 <i>but a very difficult sequence to pull off.</i>
4798246 4801458 LUCAS: <i>There are days in<br />San Francisco it looks like this.</i>
4801541 4806046 <i>There's also a thematic issue going on<br />here of concentric circles.</i>
4806129 4807839 <i>They're kind of in heaven.</i>
4807923 4810175 <i>Only when they fight<br />they're in this forgery,</i>
4810258 4813720 <i>this red hell in the middle<br />of this capsule-</i>
4813803 4815472 <i>a world within a world within a world.</i>
4815555 4818975 <i>Rings of worlds,<br />which is very Eastern in nature.</i>
4819059 4822103 <i>They go to where they think<br />they're going to get sanctuary,</i>
4822187 4824439 <i>and they ultimately find the devil there.</i>
4824522 4826650 <i>There's actually<br />a lot of things like that going on.</i>
4826733 4828610 <i>If you were to peel the movies back,</i>
4828693 4830296 <i>there's a lot of symbolism,<br />a lot of motifs...</i>
4830320 4832322 <i>and a lot of concentric circles going.</i>
4832405 4835325 MUREN: <i>Here where they're walking<br />out, here's a matte painting there.</i>
4835408 4837160 <i>Instead of building<br />a big model back there,</i>
4837244 4838304 <i>we could paint it for a lot less money...</i>
4838328 4840330 <i>and in some ways make it look<br />a lot more real.</i>
4840413 4843250 <i>The film has got<br />those paintings in it throughout.</i>
4843333 4846086 <i>All these films do, all throughout them.</i>
4846169 4848296 <i>Dozens and dozens of paintings.</i>
4851466 4853593 <i>You look at</i> Empire, <i>and it's broad.</i>
4853677 4858181 <i>You've got the whole Cloud City and all<br />the interiors of different landscapes...</i>
4858265 4859975 <i>that are way beyond<br />what we'd done before.</i>
4860100 4862977 <i>So I think it was the breadth<br />of the work was just amazing.</i>
4863060 4866939 <i>We're not just trying to dumb down<br />the sequel, or do it cheaper.</i>
4867064 4869358 <i>We're gonna do something<br />that's even bigger and better.</i>
4874530 4876967 FISHER: <i>I think they probably<br />should've put me on a half apple...</i>
4876991 4879868 <i>because I look like<br />a real midget in this shot too.</i>
4880619 4883372 <i>Look how far down he looks to see me.</i>
4884456 4885624 <i>Look.</i>
4889461 4890796 <i>Look!</i>
4892131 4894216 <i>Like I'm a little teeny-</i>
4894300 4896051 <i>There's the smiling.</i>
4903976 4905853 DANIELS:<br /><i>After we'd finished each shot,</i>
4905936 4908105 <i>the sound crew would<br />come up to me and say,</i>
4908188 4912443 <i>"Can you record that again for us<br />just wild, 'cause it's terrible."</i>
4912526 4916030 <i>'Cause the original would sound like-</i><br />[MUFFLED MUMBLING]
4916864 4919074 <i>So I would stand outside the costume.</i>
4919199 4922161 <i>And the odd thing is, at that point<br />I began to develop something...</i>
4922244 4925080 <i>that when I'm dubbing or doing a radio<br />or commercial or something-</i>
4925164 4928417 <i>Even without the suit,<br />I do stand like C-3PO.</i>
4928542 4932046 <i>Because I actually create his voice<br />at the top of the lungs.</i>
4932171 4934923 <i>So 3PO is very high up,<br />'cause he's nervous.</i>
4935049 4937259 <i>And when people are nervous,<br />they get a bit panicky.</i>
4937343 4939386 <i>Their voice tends<br />to go up a few notches.</i>
4939511 4941805 <i>They get panicky.<br />Like, "Oh, my goodness!"</i>
4941889 4944641 <i>3PO is constantly in a state of panic.</i>
4958614 4962242 <i>So even when he's at rest,<br />he's somewhat-</i>
4962326 4963646 <i>"Ready to panic any moment, sir."</i>
4967122 4969291 PETER MAYHEW:<br /><i>Your actual personality</i>
4969375 4971168 <i>has to come<br />through a costume like that.</i>
4971251 4974963 <i>Otherwise there's no point<br />in having a human being in there.</i>
4975089 4976298 <i>Which is what, I think,</i>
4976882 4978759 <i>is unique about Chewie.</i>
4978884 4981595 <i>It's the way that I walk.</i>
4981720 4983847 <i>It's the body gestures.<br />It's the head movements.</i>
4983931 4986558 <i>It's the eye movements.<br />It's everything.</i>
4986642 4989103 <i>Which has got to come from the inside.</i>
4989186 4993774 <i>Therefore, this is what<br />makes Chewie so unique.</i>
5010290 5012918 OZ: <i>The capacity I was hired in<br />was as a performer.</i>
5013001 5015045 <i>The guy who brings<br />this little character to life.</i>
5015129 5017214 <i>That was my capacity. That was my job.</i>
5021593 5025806 <i>It's always difficult, like any other<br />performers I used to work with,</i>
5025931 5028350 <i>because you're holding your hand up,</i>
5028434 5032020 <i>you're looking down<br />at a television monitor...</i>
5032104 5037109 <i>and you have to relate<br />to that person up there...</i>
5037192 5038694 <i>through that monitor...</i>
5038777 5042573 <i>and handle props in a two-dimensional<br />world which is flipped in the monitor.</i>
5042656 5045951 <i>Because the monitor is not<br />mirror image. It's flipped.</i>
5055293 5058087 <i>It takes a long time, years of training,<br />to do that-</i>
5058171 5060298 <i>just to get to that point<br />where you can understand it.</i>
5060381 5062925 <i>And the physicality of it<br />is just really physically hard.</i>
5063009 5065136 <i>That's okay. That's the job.</i>
5065219 5068681 <i>Any character that I've done,<br />you do have to make it your own.</i>
5068806 5070933 <i>It has to be part of your bones.</i>
5071017 5074812 <i>I think I made it my own the moment<br />I saw that character on the drawing.</i>
5074896 5077690 <i>I don't know what it was.<br />I knew aspects of that character.</i>
5077773 5082653 <i>Or, to be more detailed, what I did do<br />with the</i> Empire <i>script was a few things.</i>
5082737 5086324 <i>First of all, I took as much information<br />as I could from that script-</i>
5086407 5089410 <i>What Yoda knew.<br />What Yoda didn't know.</i>
5089494 5091454 <i>What was Yoda's relationship to Luke.</i>
5091537 5093998 <i>What was Yoda's relationship<br />to Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>
5094081 5096792 <i>I'd go down and I'd have a lot of pages.</i>
5096876 5099879 <i>So I knew how he felt<br />about every single person.</i>
5104884 5108346 <i>And I knew how he felt<br />in that particular time...</i>
5108429 5112225 <i>when we saw him in</i> Empire, <i>when he<br />was in Dagobah, when he was older.</i>
5112308 5114227 <i>And then I actually<br />kind of wrote a history</i>
5114310 5116312 <i>of Yoda-about a three,<br />four page history-</i>
5116395 5120149 <i>of how he lived, and how he used<br />to live, and things like that.</i>
5120233 5122610 <i>And then essentially I forgot about it.</i>
5122693 5126072 <i>Essentially just the process of doing it<br />brought it closer to me.</i>
5126155 5128866 <i>And then, of course, the real answer is-</i>
5128950 5133454 <i>the real answer of how you make a<br />character as your own is you just do it.</i>
5133538 5137625 <i>The more you do it and do it and do it,<br />and play around between takes,</i>
5137750 5138918 <i>that's how you find it.</i>
5140211 5143714 KERSHNER:<br /><i>This is McQuarrie's design-Cloud City.</i>
5145383 5146926 <i>Not bad, huh?</i>
5148636 5150096 <i>Very nice.</i>
5150221 5151764 <i>Real clouds.</i>
5151889 5153474 <i>And look at her in there.</i>
5155351 5158771 <i>That little piece is shot,<br />and the rest put into a miniature.</i>
5158854 5164110 <i>Norman Reynolds really did<br />a great job of design for these sets.</i>
5170408 5172994 FISHER: <i>Oh, look.<br />We're boyfriend and girlfriend now.</i>
5173077 5174662 <i>We're space dates.</i>
5174787 5178583 <i>In that scene, I had to go out<br />and make some kind of entrance.</i>
5179333 5183588 <i>They had me go out,<br />and they cleared the entire set.</i>
5183671 5187717 <i>When I came in, there was no camera,<br />there was no crew-there was no one.</i>
5187800 5190177 <i>Oh, that was so funny to do.</i>
5190261 5194807 <i>But I think that was the spirit of it,<br />because like I say,</i>
5194890 5199604 <i>there was this thing that you were<br />making a classic or something.</i>
5199687 5202898 <i>Not a classic. But I'm just saying,<br />you were making a film.</i>
5202982 5204859 <i>You knew all the crew from before,</i>
5204942 5207320 <i>and this thing had happened<br />in the meantime.</i>
5207403 5208946 <i>And so there was this kind of</i>
5209030 5211198 <i>heightened sense<br />of what you were doing.</i>
5211490 5214535 <i>And so there was more goofing around,<br />I think, on this film.</i>
5219957 5222793 REYNOLDS: <i>The wide shots<br />of the Cloud City</i>
5222877 5225546 <i>were matte paintings, obviously,<br />and the optical work.</i>
5225630 5231093 <i>The interiors were something that<br />I stole from all sorts of areas really.</i>
5231177 5233721 <i>The interior of Leia's apartment was</i>
5233804 5236265 <i>from the German school<br />of architecture...</i>
5236349 5239226 <i>of Bauhaus in the 1920s.</i>
5239310 5242812 <i>And that seemed to be<br />an interesting way to go.</i>
5242937 5245899 <i>So I designed her apartment<br />in that way,</i>
5245982 5249235 <i>with recesses of various shapes<br />within the walls.</i>
5249319 5255075 <i>It really is a sort of concoction<br />that tied in vaguely with the exterior.</i>
5255158 5258036 <i>Although most of the exterior<br />was circular.</i>
5258119 5259954 <i>It's something that<br />sort of evolved really.</i>
5260038 5265835 <i>I remember it was<br />a big sound stage at Elstree.</i>
5265919 5269506 <i>We couldn't have made it any bigger<br />without knocking stage walls down.</i>
5280141 5282143 BILLY DEE WILLIAMS: <i>For me,</i>
5282227 5283895 <i>Lando was just<br />this wonderful, charming-</i>
5283978 5286189 <i>I had a cape. I wore a cape.</i>
5286981 5288566 <i>That just did it for me.</i>
5288650 5290735 <i>I mean, I had this whole idea of myself.</i>
5290819 5294781 <i>Suddenly, I transformed<br />into Lando Calrissian.</i>
5294906 5298034 <i>Then of course there's this<br />cute little girl.</i>
5298118 5300120 <i>And I had to do<br />the whole hand-kissing bit.</i>
5300245 5302455 <i>Just part and parcel.</i>
5302580 5305083 <i>It came with wearing that cape!</i><br />[LAUGHING]
5305208 5308044 <i>So that's what Lando is.</i>
5308128 5311756 <i>But I also had<br />that kind of suave, wonderful charm...</i>
5311881 5313967 <i>that I can, every now and again,<br />throw around.</i>
5314050 5315552 <i>So they used it.</i>
5315635 5318805 <i>And for me, I was<br />the first brown-skinned man</i>
5318888 5320890 <i>to be in space-on-screen at least.</i>
5320974 5323685 <i>I don't know. I can't even think<br />of anybody who's</i>
5323768 5326396 <i>been in space<br />who's a brown-skinned person.</i>
5336406 5341828 <i>I wanted the whole thing to be devoid<br />of the whole racial thing.</i>
5341953 5345832 <i>I really wanted it. And I know that<br />when Lando was introduced,</i>
5345957 5349836 <i>he was introduced because<br />I think George was getting a lot of flak...</i>
5349961 5354424 <i>about Darth Vader<br />being the only sort of figure there.</i>
5354507 5358011 <i>This big dark figure who's evil,<br />who personified evil.</i>
5358094 5360722 <i>I think a lot of people<br />didn't appreciate that.</i>
5360805 5366311 <i>I think the idea of bringing Lando into<br />the situation sort of clarifies things.</i>
5366394 5369689 <i>It says that we're all involved<br />in this whole question...</i>
5369773 5372901 <i>of the light and the dark-<br />good and evil.</i>
5372984 5377030 <i>But what I tried to do with Lando<br />was I tried to-</i>
5377113 5379532 <i>which I always try to do with all<br />the characters I play-</i>
5379657 5382786 <i>I seem to want to transcend<br />all of these questions</i>
5382869 5385538 <i>of those differences<br />like black and white.</i>
5385622 5390084 <i>So I tried to make Lando sort of<br />this man-a guy in the future.</i>
5390168 5395006 <i>He was beyond all of that.<br />There was no life about that really.</i>
5396633 5398885 <i>It's always interesting<br />to create a character</i>
5398968 5402138 <i>that is a sort of dual character.</i>
5402222 5404265 <i>You're not quite sure about him.</i>
5404349 5407393 <i>Especially if he's cute.<br />And I was really kind of cute.</i>
5407477 5412690 <i>This guy had this whole situation<br />up there in Bespin, in Cloud City.</i>
5413733 5418488 <i>And all of a sudden these people<br />come in on this spacecraft.</i>
5418571 5423243 <i>And right behind them is Darth Vader.</i>
5423326 5426746 <i>Everybody knows what it is<br />to deal with Darth Vader.</i>
5426871 5428998 <i>I even tried to go up<br />against Darth Vader...</i>
5429582 5435462 <i>but realized that I had to back down<br />and figure something else out.</i>
5435546 5440509 <i>But Lando creates a situation...</i>
5440592 5443095 <i>that buys him time...</i>
5443178 5445848 <i>so that he wouldn't have to<br />lose his situation.</i>
5445931 5449560 <i>But he ends up losing the situation<br />because of these people anyway.</i>
5449643 5455941 <i>But rather than create<br />the complete demise of Han Solo,</i>
5456024 5460779 <i>he had to go along<br />with a certain procedure...</i>
5460863 5464950 <i>with the hopes of working it all out<br />in some way.</i>
5465075 5468203 <i>You know, correcting it in some way,<br />which he tries to do.</i>
5468287 5471123 <i>And it's pretty obvious<br />that he tries to do it.</i>
5497900 5500944 KERSHNER: <i>Of course he is<br />double-crossed by Darth Vader,</i>
5501028 5502905 <i>who can do anything he wants.</i>
5502988 5505324 <i>Or you're toast.</i>
5506491 5507492 <i>Now-</i>
5509786 5511955 <i>Oh, he comes to life!</i>
5512080 5514416 <i>"My head's on backwards."</i>
5515918 5518962 <i>And he's arguing<br />and complaining and all.</i>
5519087 5521298 <i>And so he shuts him down.</i>
5521423 5523133 [LAUGHING]
5523258 5528263 <i>It's the interplay of the gadgets,</i>
5528347 5530515 <i>is very important for humor.</i>
5532351 5536730 <i>I was very impressed<br />with Harrison's performance here.</i>
5536813 5539399 <i>'Cause he looked like<br />he'd gone through hell.</i>
5542945 5544863 <i>Oh, he's so tired.</i>
5544947 5546782 <i>He's just been tortured.</i>
5548492 5554498 <i>And Leia can now show<br />her affection because he's weak.</i>
5554623 5560420 <i>And women love it, I guess,<br />when a man is down-and-out and weak.</i>
5560504 5563173 <i>Now she can be motherly to him.</i>
5563298 5567427 <i>And this is really<br />the feminine impulse, I guess.</i>
5567511 5569763 <i>The women are going to<br />hate me for saying this.</i>
5572265 5574267 <i>And here comes the enemy.</i>
5574351 5577729 <i>He set up the thing. He didn't tell them<br />that Darth Vader was there.</i>
5577813 5579815 <i>He didn't really help them.</i>
5597833 5600836 <i>And so he gets<br />another blow to the head.</i>
5601920 5603880 <i>And Calrissian walks out on him.</i>
5604006 5606883 <i>This was a very important scene<br />here for me.</i>
5607009 5610512 <i>Very hard to do,<br />to make it absolutely real.</i>
5611638 5616351 <i>Each character is very well defined.</i>
5617060 5620188 <i>And I think Harrison<br />and Leia are terrific.</i>
5622024 5624150 FISHER:<br /><i>This is so sad.</i>
5624233 5628112 <i>It was unbelievably hot up here.</i>
5628863 5631615 <i>And Harrison rewrote it.</i>
5631699 5634201 <i>I said, "I love you,"<br />and he said, "I know."</i>
5636245 5642084 <i>This is exactly when I thought,<br />"All right. I am gonna write stuff...</i>
5642209 5647381 <i>because I'm not just gonna<br />be someone who's given pink pages."</i>
5647965 5652053 <i>But Harrison was really good at it.<br />He did do it with his character in mind.</i>
5652136 5656432 <i>He furthered the story, and so on.</i>
5656515 5659810 <i>I got what he was doing,<br />and I saw the value of it.</i>
5660644 5663064 <i>And he did it well.<br />I couldn't be someone who said,</i>
5663147 5665983 <i>"He's just an egotist doing dialogue."</i>
5666067 5669653 <i>And he and Kersh did it, by the way.<br />That was the other thing.</i>
5669737 5672490 <i>It was like the guys went off<br />and did the scene,</i>
5672573 5673908 <i>and then I was handed the pages.</i>
5673991 5677578 <i>That's when I thought,<br />"This won't happen again."</i>
5677661 5680164 <i>He was very creative.</i>
5680748 5683626 <i>He was also about 15 years older.<br />It was just happening around me.</i>
5683751 5687588 <i>And I just thought,<br />"I want to get in on this one too then."</i>
5694178 5696847 KERSHNER: <i>I felt that this march<br />was very necessary,</i>
5696931 5698974 <i>and I sort of kept things moving.</i>
5699058 5702812 <i>Lots of steam. That thing moves up<br />in the middle of the big hole.</i>
5702895 5706107 <i>We don't know what that thing is.<br />You don't have to know anything.</i>
5706190 5708234 <i>And here comes Darth Vader.</i>
5708317 5710111 <i>So now we're in trouble.</i>
5710194 5713948 <i>And the fact that he's handcuffed<br />means he's really in trouble.</i>
5714031 5716700 <i>And Calrissian doesn't know<br />what he's gonna do.</i>
5718285 5722957 <i>Now comes a great moment<br />where they have to say good-bye.</i>
5723499 5725042 <i>Whoops!</i>
5727795 5729797 <i>And, of course, C-3PO is shouting out,</i>
5729880 5731549 <i>"What's happening?<br />What's happening?"</i>
5735052 5737763 <i>The sounds are wonderful<br />that Burtt put on.</i>
5737847 5740349 BURTT:<br /><i>The electrical sounds snapping on high.</i>
5740432 5742852 <i>Actually a bit of this sound<br />was one of those rare moments...</i>
5742935 5745271 <i>in which the sound<br />on the set was pretty good.</i>
5745354 5748524 <i>The actual electrical snapping<br />in that scene</i>
5748607 5750943 <i>is from the actual production<br />on the set...</i>
5751026 5753487 <i>since they had a live spark coil.</i>
5753571 5755489 <i>We added to it by putting some hum</i>
5755573 5759118 <i>and things in it from<br />the old Strickfaden collection.</i>
5760369 5761537 I love you.
5761662 5763372 I know.
5765416 5768919 <i>The illumination is created<br />by two electrical rods burning.</i>
5769044 5771589 <i>And we were at a theatrical<br />supply company.</i>
5771672 5775551 <i>They actually turned on<br />a lot of these carbon arc lamps for us.</i>
5775676 5778012 <i>We had some microphones<br />inside the lamps.</i>
5778095 5781098 <i>But before the carbon arc would go on-<br />just the sound of the arc-</i>
5781182 5783392 <i>the motor which turns<br />the arc on a lathe...</i>
5783475 5785853 <i>made an interesting churning sound.</i>
5785936 5788606 <i>And we took that sound<br />and played it in a big echo chamber.</i>
5788689 5793277 <i>And that became the basic sound<br />for the carbon freezing chamber.</i>
5793360 5796197 <i>The sort of undulating low tones.</i>
5796864 5799366 <i>There's a little whistling sound<br />that you hear</i>
5799450 5802369 <i>when the carbon block<br />is raised up out of the pit.</i>
5802453 5806957 <i>And that was produced by taking a<br />tiny little piece of flexible water pipe...</i>
5807082 5809752 <i>and touching it to a block of dry ice.</i>
5816424 5818718 <i>And when the metal touches the dry ice,</i>
5818801 5821846 <i>it actually boils away<br />the dry ice a little bit.</i>
5821930 5824599 <i>That produces escaping gases...</i>
5824682 5828811 <i>which, as they fly through the little pipe,<br />made it into a little musical instrument.</i>
5828895 5830396 <i>It was really just an accident.</i>
5830480 5833942 <i>We were recording a lot of effects<br />by placing metal against dry ice...</i>
5834025 5837779 <i>to get squeaks<br />and sharp musical sounds,</i>
5837862 5839822 <i>which are used for the lightsaber hits.</i>
5839906 5842158 <i>But out of that experiment...</i>
5842242 5844160 <i>came a lot of other funny little noises</i>
5844244 5847705 <i>that came out of metal<br />touching the dry ice.</i>
5847789 5851084 <i>You could put a coin on dry ice, and<br />you can get a ringing, buzzing sound.</i>
5851167 5854837 <i>And you can get a lot of good elements<br />for laser guns...</i>
5854921 5857757 <i>and what could be used<br />for electrical sparking...</i>
5857840 5862845 <i>as well as arcing of electricity<br />from the metal and dry ice effects.</i>
5864764 5867058 <i>Once again, that familiar<br />Dumpster that you can</i>
5867141 5868869 <i>rent and have it brought<br />to your own sidewalk...</i>
5868893 5870770 <i>is a useful tool for sound effects.</i>
5870853 5875608 <i>The sound of the giant carbon block<br />hitting the floor after Han is frozen...</i>
5875692 5878194 <i>is just the sound of the lid<br />being slammed...</i>
5878278 5882198 <i>on the big garbage Dumpster<br />in front of my house.</i>
5898965 5901634 FISHER: <i>So this is when<br />he became a coffee table.</i>
5902302 5904220 <i>That's what we called it.</i>
5905138 5906139 <i>Bye-bye.</i>
5906222 5909267 <i>I like that guy's thing with the glowing-</i>
5909767 5912186 <i>It looks like my hair with lights.</i>
5914647 5917400 LUCAS:<br /><i>I didn't want to kill off Han Solo.</i>
5917483 5919277 <i>Harrison wanted me to kill him off.</i>
5919360 5920879 <i>"But I said," No, I'm not gonna do that</i>
5920903 5924324 <i>because he has a part to play<br />in the next film."</i>
5924407 5926993 <i>When you're putting together a story,</i>
5927076 5928470 <i>you're dealing with<br />lots of different complexities.</i>
5928494 5930788 <i>Part of them are technical in terms of</i>
5930872 5932516 <i>getting characters to be<br />where they need to be.</i>
5932540 5935960 <i>And you have ideas<br />of where you want things-</i>
5936044 5938087 <i>scenes that need to take place...</i>
5938171 5941090 <i>and how you maneuver your<br />characters around to get them there.</i>
5941174 5945303 <i>And it's especially difficult on a film,<br />because there are physical realities,</i>
5945386 5949682 <i>where in a book you can move around<br />much more easily in a literary situation.</i>
5949766 5953186 <i>The thing about cinema<br />is it works in time.</i>
5953978 5957523 <i>You're going over a two-hour,<br />two-and-a-half-hour period,</i>
5957607 5959233 <i>and you're moving things around.</i>
5959317 5962195 <i>Obviously part of the art<br />of cinema is learning</i>
5962278 5965198 <i>how to maneuver from place to place,</i>
5965281 5967950 <i>story point to story point,<br />without confusing the audience...</i>
5968034 5971662 <i>but getting that fluidity<br />that comes in really good novels...</i>
5971746 5974707 <i>of being able to-<br />through chapter headings,</i>
5974832 5976793 <i>or just through<br />stream of consciousness-</i>
5976876 5978544 <i>move people around very fast...</i>
5978628 5980463 <i>and put them in a state of mind to get to</i>
5980546 5983049 <i>a particular situation<br />that you want to talk about.</i>
5983216 5986302 <i>In film, you actually are stuck<br />with reality to do that with.</i>
5986386 5989055 <i>You have a plot. If you're gonna<br />get rid of all your characters,</i>
5989138 5991766 <i>you have to explain how you do that.</i>
5991849 5993893 <i>You can't just do it.</i>
6002902 6007656 KERSHNER: <i>I loved her sticking<br />her head out for one last scream.</i>
6023630 6026508 HAMILL: <i>That second installment<br />was so grueling.</i>
6028885 6031721 <i>Partially it's because<br />in the sequence where</i>
6031805 6034015 <i>we have the major confrontation<br />with Vader,</i>
6034099 6037436 <i>it's meant to be<br />in a carbon freezing chamber.</i>
6037519 6041398 <i>And the way they achieved that<br />was steam.</i>
6041481 6043525 <i>So it was like doing it in a sauna bath.</i>
6043608 6047612 <i>That's why my hair's so wet all the time<br />is because I just sweated buckets.</i>
6047696 6049865 <i>And it was done-<br />again, I can't remember.</i>
6049948 6053743 <i>This is all trying to go back and<br />remember exactly how long it took.</i>
6053827 6060667 <i>But it was weeks for<br />however many minutes it's on screen.</i>
6060792 6065172 <i>Even if you do all the moves correctly-<br />and there are mistakes.</i>
6065297 6067466 <i>Bob Anderson was tremendous.</i>
6067549 6070635 <i>Because here he is,<br />this Olympic fencing champion,</i>
6070719 6074639 <i>and he's able to make you<br />look better than you really are.</i>
6074723 6079686 <i>It still was just so hard.</i>
6079769 6083315 <i>And the bruises and the aches-</i>
6083857 6089154 <i>It wasn't fun in the sense-</i>
6089237 6090822 <i>It wasn't like breezy fun.</i>
6090906 6093825 <i>It was dark and serious.</i>
6095702 6101666 <i>You wanted to make it look really great,<br />but it was so hot on that set.</i>
6102209 6104377 <i>And it was hard for me to complain,</i>
6104461 6106061 <i>because at least<br />I had my face uncovered.</i>
6107547 6111593 <i>When they could, Bob didn't have to<br />have the face mask on-</i>
6112302 6115263 <i>if it was over his shoulder<br />or from behind.</i>
6115347 6120310 <i>Also, at the time I had<br />a real enthusiasm for it all.</i>
6120393 6125398 <i>I think you wanted to jump in with both<br />feet and do the best you could.</i>
6126608 6130278 MAYHEW: <i>Coming down to do<br />the last couple of shots...</i>
6130362 6133448 <i>onto the landing platform<br />where the</i> Falcon <i>is.</i>
6133532 6136368 KERSHNER: <i>When we were on the set<br />and it got too hot, he fainted.</i>
6136451 6140664 <i>He had to go to the hospital from heat,<br />from this woolen outfit.</i>
6140747 6142666 MAYHEW:<br /><i>Chewie went down.</i>
6142749 6145544 <i>Didn't damage the robot at all.<br />Got up-</i>
6146211 6147671 <i>"All you all right, Peter?" "Yeah."</i>
6147754 6150215 <i>And this was Kersh-<br />he was very concerned about it.</i>
6150298 6153134 <i>I said, "Yeah. It's just dehydration."</i>
6153218 6156888 <i>Working in a costume like that<br />with probably 40 pounds on your back-</i>
6156972 6158431 <i>something's gonna happen.</i>
6158515 6162310 <i>Anyway, my stand-in<br />that happened to be there-</i>
6162394 6167023 <i>they tried putting the costume on,<br />tried to do that similar shot.</i>
6167107 6169317 KERSHNER:<br /><i>You'd think anybody could do it. No.</i>
6169401 6172988 <i>It just didn't walk<br />and move like the Wookiee.</i>
6173071 6174906 <i>He tried, but it didn't work.</i>
6174990 6177492 <i>Had to wait for him to come back<br />to get the shots.</i>
6180620 6184207 LUCAS: <i>This is another Joe Johnston<br />design for the Boba Fett ship.</i>
6184291 6185851 <i>I wanted something<br />that looked completely</i>
6185875 6187586 <i>different from anything we'd ever seen.</i>
6194593 6197011 BURTT: <i>Very surprising to see<br />some of the new shots.</i>
6197094 6199054 <i>These are old shots,<br />but with things added.</i>
6199138 6201807 <i>They've done matte paintings<br />and put windows in so you can see out.</i>
6201890 6204268 <i>A lot of that was not there<br />in the original movie.</i>
6204935 6207438 <i>When Boba Fett's ship takes off,</i>
6207521 6211483 <i>the principal sound of it lifting off<br />was actually made...</i>
6211567 6215696 <i>with a trombone blowing<br />a very bad and sour note.</i>
6222703 6225706 <i>I'd gotten the trombone in an attempt<br />to try to do something more musical,</i>
6225831 6228667 <i>but what ended up<br />was a rather poorly played note,</i>
6228792 6231795 <i>but it seemed to work well for the<br />ignition of Boba Fett's ship,</i> Slave I.
6239762 6242348 PETER DIAMOND:<br /><i>From the top of the stairs...</i>
6242431 6245267 <i>to the bottom of the stairs,<br />that was Bob Anderson doubling Vader.</i>
6245351 6247102 <i>If Dave had done that, we would've</i>
6247186 6249772 <i>needed three times<br />the thickness of wires.</i>
6249855 6254568 <i>The wire side didn't become a skill<br />until computers came in.</i>
6254693 6256403 <i>'Cause then you could thicken up<br />the wires,</i>
6256487 6258656 <i>and they could erase them<br />with the computer.</i>
6258739 6260491 <i>So it was completely safe.</i>
6260574 6264787 <i>But I, as a stunt performer, have been<br />on very thin wires which have snapped.</i>
6264870 6267831 <i>Fortunately, I always make sure there's<br />a safety bed underneath to fall on.</i>
6267915 6271377 <i>But it was renowned in the '50s<br />and '60s that wires snapped...</i>
6271502 6273982 <i>'cause they were so thin-<br />'cause they were trying to hide them.</i>
6274046 6277841 KERSHNER: <i>That was done fast, him flying<br />out of there. But I think you see it.</i>
6278842 6280594 <i>I worried about that.</i>
6280678 6283639 <i>And here I used the steam-</i>
6284556 6289895 <i>It's not steam.<br />It's fire extinguisher stuff-</i>
6289978 6293732 <i>to make the whole thing kind of eerier.</i>
6293816 6297528 <i>Cutting the cord<br />and having the stuff coming out.</i>
6297611 6299697 <i>I tried it without it. It didn't work.</i>
6299780 6301532 <i>It looked ordinary.</i>
6301615 6307246 <i>So I just filled it up with all<br />this carbon dioxide, I guess it is,</i>
6307371 6311041 <i>which makes it much more mysterious.</i>
6316588 6319842 DIAMOND: <i>Darth Vader didn't have<br />a double in the first picture...</i>
6319925 6322261 <i>because of budget restraints<br />and everything else.</i>
6323095 6325931 <i>But when we came to<br />what was going to be bigger fights,</i>
6326014 6327766 <i>I talked to production,<br />I talked to George.</i>
6327850 6330102 <i>I said, "I would love<br />to bring a double in."</i>
6330811 6333480 <i>So he agreed with me.<br />So I brought in Professor Anderson-</i>
6333564 6335691 <i>Bob Anderson-<br />who doubled Darth Vader...</i>
6335774 6339069 <i>on</i> Empire Strikes Back <i>and</i> Jedi<br /><i>on the sword fights.</i>
6339153 6342072 <i>In any sword fight, you're only as good<br />as the man you fight,</i>
6342156 6343741 <i>because if the man<br />you're fighting makes</i>
6343824 6345367 <i>a mistake, then you've made a mistake.</i>
6345451 6347953 <i>And Bob Anderson<br />and I have been working</i>
6348036 6349872 <i>in movies together for 40-odd years...</i>
6349955 6351415 <i>doing sword fights.</i>
6351498 6353959 <i>Either I'm the villain-<br />and I prefer to be the villain...</i>
6354084 6355586 <i>'cause the villain gets more money...</i>
6355669 6358106 <i>'cause he's the one that falls down<br />stairs and everything else.</i>
6358130 6360841 <i>Bob, because he's tall,<br />was always the hero.</i>
6360924 6364678 <i>But he couldn't act. And this was<br />the laugh between Bob and I.</i>
6364762 6367389 <i>I said, "Bob, don't act.<br />Leave the acting to us."</i>
6367473 6371393 <i>But anyway,<br />Bob doubled Darth Vader,</i>
6371477 6373437 <i>and he brought his own style with it.</i>
6373520 6376148 <i>And that's why it was more staccato.</i>
6376231 6379276 <i>It was bam-bam, and stop. Then there's<br />more walking and more pausing...</i>
6379359 6381278 <i>which gave it more dramatic tension.</i>
6381361 6385616 <i>And also I worked a lot in the theater,<br />and actors have to do that on fights.</i>
6385699 6389702 <i>So I was able to bring the dramatic<br />side of it more to fruition...</i>
6389827 6391954 <i>than I could in the first</i> Star Wars.
6397293 6399587 KERSHNER:<br /><i>Now this was a hell of a challenge.</i>
6399670 6403674 <i>How to do this scene<br />with these things flying at him...</i>
6403758 6408679 <i>and the wind and flying out of a window<br />and</i>- [EXHALES]
6408763 6410765 <i>But you work it out.</i>
6410848 6412975 <i>That was a stunt double who jumped...</i>
6413059 6415478 <i>and threw himself backwards<br />out the window.</i>
6420149 6422902 <i>I had to think much differently<br />than I usually did.</i>
6424153 6427490 <i>First of all,<br />I couldn't move the camera...</i>
6427573 6433454 <i>on so many scenes that were important<br />to move the camera for rhythm.</i>
6433538 6435331 <i>To me, film is music.</i>
6436207 6437959 <i>It's poetry and music.</i>
6438042 6441629 <i>Poetry in terms of<br />it's a shorthand technique.</i>
6441712 6443673 <i>Music in terms of rhythm.</i>
6444674 6448302 REYNOLDS: <i>Kershner complained<br />that there weren't enough corridors.</i>
6448386 6452723 <i>I mean, there were corridors,<br />but when people are running,</i>
6452807 6454767 <i>they certainly use up a lot of set...</i>
6454851 6458479 <i>so he had to really be ingenious...</i>
6460147 6465027 <i>and place his camera in such a way<br />that he could duplicate certain angles.</i>
6465111 6467864 <i>But it all worked finally in the end.</i>
6467947 6470324 KERSHNER:<br /><i>So I had to use cuts.</i>
6470408 6473870 <i>So I used as much as possible<br />action cuts.</i>
6474704 6478916 <i>An action cut is where a scene<br />goes to a certain point...</i>
6479041 6482837 <i>and the actor does this or that,<br />and you cut to another shot...</i>
6482920 6487925 <i>in which the movement is continued,<br />and the audience is fooled.</i>
6488009 6491178 <i>The eye is fooled,<br />and it looks like there's no cut.</i>
6491262 6493097 <i>In fact, you ask them,<br />"Where's the cut?"</i>
6493180 6494241 <i>And they say, "What do you mean?"</i>
6494265 6497894 <i>"Where the two pieces"-<br />"What two pieces?" They think it's one.</i>
6498436 6503900 <i>It's very tricky, because you have<br />to create the rhythm in the shooting.</i>
6504567 6508070 <i>So you have to know.<br />You can't depend on editing.</i>
6508154 6511574 <i>And George's style is totally different.</i>
6511657 6515703 <i>He depends on editing<br />to get things together and moving.</i>
6515786 6518289 <i>And he does it beautifully.<br />He's a great editor.</i>
6519081 6521250 <i>I had to do it in shooting...</i>
6521334 6525296 <i>so that I could create<br />that illusion of movement...</i>
6525421 6529508 <i>because often-most of the time-<br />I had to shoot static scenes.</i>
6534055 6536057 HAMILL:<br /><i>I was always asking him questions,</i>
6536140 6540561 <i>because you sort of felt<br />you were on a "need to know" basis.</i>
6541687 6543773 <i>"Who's my father?"<br />"Where's my mom?"</i>
6544690 6546776 <i>He lied. Of course.</i>
6546859 6549278 <i>If he told me the truth,<br />who could trust me?</i>
6549362 6555785 <i>Although I think I'm pretty good<br />in terms of keeping secrets,</i>
6555868 6557411 <i>because they had to tell me what</i>
6557495 6560206 <i>the surprise was<br />at the end of the second one.</i>
6560289 6562049 <i>And I really wasn't<br />supposed to tell anybody.</i>
6564126 6569799 <i>Not even other people in the cast<br />that were friends of mine at the time.</i>
6570424 6572551 <i>They leaked fake information.</i>
6572635 6576430 <i>He said, "You don't know the truth.<br />Obi-Wan killed your father."</i>
6576514 6579182 <i>And I screamed, "No!"<br />just as it was meant to be.</i>
6579307 6583728 <i>But they had taken me aside and said,<br />"This is what he's really going to say."</i>
6584229 6589484 <i>And within 10 days,<br />it was in the British tabloids,</i>
6589567 6592821 <i>"Alec Guinness,<br />head baddie in</i> Star Wars II."
6594239 6596658 <i>And that's because it's so impossible.</i>
6596741 6598618 <i>If just people are on the set-</i>
6598702 6602664 <i>they were extras in stormtrooper outfits<br />and so forth.</i>
6602747 6604833 <i>We were the only two on-screen, but-</i>
6605875 6608378 <i>And I don't know<br />if they ever traced the leak.</i>
6608503 6611673 <i>But there was satisfaction...</i>
6611756 6615719 <i>at having leaked bogus information.</i>
6616302 6619681 <i>And I love surprises.<br />I wasn't about to blab it.</i>
6619764 6624394 <i>And I thought it was such a great twist<br />that no one would see coming.</i>
6628356 6631276 <i>Because remember now-<br />the first one, no one cared.</i>
6631401 6633445 <i>There wasn't any interest in it.</i>
6633528 6637198 <i>By the time we got there to do the<br />second, there was intense interest.</i>
6637282 6642620 <i>They buzzed our sets in helicopters...</i>
6642746 6646249 <i>up in Finse, Norway,<br />trying to get shots.</i>
6646374 6647584 <i>I loved it too.</i>
6647709 6654466 <i>It said, "Strange alien craft explore<br />the far-off planet in</i> Star Wars II."
6654549 6657510 <i>And it was like snowploughs...</i>
6657594 6660513 <i>where you could clearly read<br />the brand name on the side-</i>
6660597 6662891 <i>Caterpillar or whatever it was.</i>
6662974 6665393 <i>And that was just<br />the difference between...</i>
6665477 6667479 <i>what happened<br />between the first and the second.</i>
6667562 6670398 ...never told you<br />what happened to your father.
6670482 6671941 He told me enough.
6674486 6676404 He told me you killed him.
6676488 6677989 No.
6678073 6680283 I am your father.
6684829 6686790 No.
6686915 6688416 No.
6688750 6690752 That's not true.
6691586 6693213 That's impossible!
6693296 6694964 Search your feelings.
6695090 6696730 LUCAS: <i>When you see the films<br />I through VI</i>
6696800 6698200 <i>it's a very different experience...</i>
6698259 6700762 <i>than seeing it IV through VI,<br />then I through III.</i>
6700845 6703890 <i>But the idea of when Darth Vader<br />comes on in Episode IV,</i>
6703973 6705850 <i>it suddenly has a huge,<br />powerful effect...</i>
6705934 6710438 <i>because you know right from the get-go<br />that that is Princess Leia's father.</i>
6710522 6713942 <i>You know that when you cut down to<br />Luke, you know that that's his son.</i>
6714025 6716444 <i>And you realize that Darth Vader<br />is this pathetic character.</i>
6716528 6718863 <i>He's not this big all-powerful monster.</i>
6719531 6722742 <i>He's actually a pathetic man<br />who made some wrong choices,</i>
6722826 6725411 <i>who found himself trapped<br />in the world of evil.</i>
6725495 6728498 <i>He made a bargain with the devil,<br />and now he's living in hell,</i>
6728623 6731126 <i>and the only people that can<br />get him out are his kids.</i>
6742011 6746432 BURTT: <i>The ambience in the central air<br />passage that's part of Bespin...</i>
6746516 6751437 <i>was produced with this old mechanical<br />wind-making machine.</i>
6751521 6753606 <i>It's a device which had<br />an electric motor,</i>
6753690 6757819 <i>and you could put little different rings-</i>
6757902 6760071 <i>little doughnut-shaped washers into it,</i>
6760196 6763575 <i>and it would spin,<br />and like a musical instrument,</i>
6763700 6767912 <i>the air passing over these little washers<br />would make a windy sound.</i>
6769872 6772499 <i>We got an old television antenna...</i>
6772583 6776879 <i>and rattled it for the sounds of Luke<br />as he stands on this antenna.</i>
6779381 6782718 MUREN: <i>This is where Mark's hanging<br />now at the bottom of the Cloud City.</i>
6782801 6786388 <i>This was very difficult to combine<br />these shots and get these to look real...</i>
6786471 6789850 <i>with the difficulty of blue screen in<br />those days, and lighting and everything.</i>
6789933 6791685 <i>But it came out still pretty exciting.</i>
6792227 6793937 KERSHNER:<br /><i>He's off the ground here...</i>
6794021 6796857 <i>being held up with some<br />nylon cords in case he fell.</i>
6797691 6800277 <i>I thought Mark did a great job here...</i>
6800360 6805824 <i>because he really had to fight<br />to hold on with the wind blowing.</i>
6805908 6807409 <i>You see the wind?</i>
6807534 6811580 <i>His hair, the flap.<br />And held up by his belt.</i>
6823342 6827012 <i>And he turns on for Leia.<br />"Leia! Leia!"</i>
6827095 6828931 <i>'Cause he knows he has some power.</i>
6829014 6830724 <i>And she of course responds.</i>
6830807 6833393 <i>And she really looks<br />like she got the message.</i>
6834811 6837731 <i>It was amazing.<br />I said, "Don't blink."</i>
6837814 6841818 <i>And she said, "Okay." And her eyes<br />are wide open, not blinking.</i>
6841902 6844821 <i>If she blinked, it wouldn't be as strong.</i>
6852579 6853956 FISHER:<br /><i>That's beautiful.</i>
6854081 6858043 <i>They've enhanced<br />all the sunsets and everything.</i>
6858126 6860796 <i>And I think when we saw<br />all of this, we were shocked...</i>
6860921 6862965 <i>because of course<br />there was nothing there.</i>
6863048 6864841 <i>All this stuff.</i>
6864925 6867552 <i>We were looking at<br />pieces of cardboard on the set,</i>
6867636 6869346 <i>but it was in the script.</i>
6872307 6875227 LUCAS: <i>Generally, when I'm working<br />with another director,</i>
6875310 6879106 <i>I say, "This is your film,"<br />and I put my two cents' worth in...</i>
6879189 6883193 <i>and try to give my opinions<br />about what I feel is important.</i>
6883277 6886697 <i>And it usually works as a very good<br />collaboration that way.</i>
6886822 6889032 <i>Because I'm not sort of<br />lording it over the director...</i>
6890117 6891994 <i>with my understanding<br />of special effects...</i>
6892119 6894246 <i>and what I thought<br />we could do and couldn't do.</i>
6894329 6896581 <i>So he had a special effects expert<br />on the set with him,</i>
6896665 6899084 <i>helping him develop the way<br />certain scenes went together,</i>
6899167 6901628 <i>'cause I could tell him<br />what we could and couldn't do.</i>
6902170 6904256 <i>So I really became more of a helper,</i>
6904339 6907467 <i>more of an expert<br />on the world of</i> Star Wars...
6907551 6910429 <i>and an expert in the world<br />of special effects.</i>
6916893 6918955 KERSHNER: <i>I don't know<br />what he was breathing out there,</i>
6918979 6921898 <i>but there must be oxygen, because if<br />there are clouds, there's water.</i>
6921982 6923650 <i>There must be air.</i>
6923734 6927487 <i>I had to, for myself,<br />justify everything on a real basis...</i>
6927571 6930449 <i>so that it didn't get too far out.</i>
6930532 6934369 <i>'Cause even though it's a fairy tale,<br />there is a reality factor.</i>
6938832 6942627 KASDAN: <i>When George told me at the<br />beginning of our sessions on</i> Empire...
6942711 6947591 <i>that Darth was Luke's father,<br />I thought, "Oh, my God, that's fabulous."</i>
6947674 6952637 <i>Here was this wonderful fantasy<br />that got back to some primal issues,</i>
6952721 6955891 <i>which is,<br />"Was my father a benevolent figure?"</i>
6955974 6957434 <i>"Was he an evil figure?"</i>
6957517 6960269 <i>"Am I going to be like him?"<br />"Was he once a better person?"</i>
6960353 6962855 <i>And we knew<br />where the story was going.</i>
6962938 6965941 <i>We were starting to build<br />what isn't in the first film...</i>
6966067 6968027 <i>and is very strongly in</i> Empire...
6968110 6970780 <i>is that there's a person<br />behind the mask,</i>
6970905 6973949 <i>that Darth has been something else.</i>
6975743 6979580 <i>And this yearning he has to enlist Luke<br />is not just a political thing.</i>
6979705 6982708 <i>It's not just the bidding of the Emperor.</i>
6982792 6986754 <i>It is an urge on his part<br />to bring his son into the fold.</i>
6986879 6990883 <i>So as soon as you're doing that<br />in the movie, it's really interesting.</i>
6996097 6998224 BURTT: <i>There are moments<br />where a film comes to life.</i>
6998307 6999517 <i>We'd always be working with</i>
6999600 7001560 <i>a black-and-white,<br />scratchy copy of the film.</i>
7001644 7005064 <i>That's all we would see until we were<br />almost done with the sound,</i>
7005147 7007459 <i>and then one day we'd suddenly<br />go into the theater and see it...</i>
7007483 7010903 <i>against a sharp,<br />color-corrected picture.</i>
7010986 7013590 <i>That would make a big difference.<br />It would seem like a different movie.</i>
7013614 7015366 <i>It would even sound different...</i>
7015449 7019120 <i>because of now the way<br />your eye and your ear were...</i>
7019245 7023207 <i>being exposed to the depth<br />of everything you had done.</i>
7023290 7026210 <i>And then there's that moment<br />when you first see it with an audience.</i>
7026293 7029630 <i>And you might be burned out.<br />You might be tired of it.</i>
7029713 7033342 <i>Seeing it with an audience gives you<br />that perspective that an audience has,</i>
7033426 7035386 <i>and you get to see it fresh.</i>
7035970 7039765 McQUARRIE: <i>When I was a kid, I really<br />liked my Flash Gordon spaceships...</i>
7039849 7042768 <i>and my Buck Rogers squirt gun.</i>
7044562 7046021 <i>And stuff, you know?</i>
7046147 7051277 <i>I'd really thought a lot of these things,<br />as a kid will do.</i>
7051360 7056323 <i>And when I saw my stuff<br />now take the place...</i>
7056449 7060744 <i>of these other artists<br />that had done these things,</i>
7060828 7064331 <i>I was kind of happy to be in that genre.</i>
7066125 7070379 KERSHNER: <i>Now it's very important<br />here his hand was cut off,</i>
7070463 7073591 <i>which shows that Darth Vader's<br />got more power than he has.</i>
7073674 7077595 <i>These details are very, very important.</i>
7077678 7082641 <i>And they give you<br />the believability factor...</i>
7082725 7084226 <i>which you need...</i>
7084310 7088564 <i>because there's nothing believable<br />about this environment.</i>
7089148 7091233 <i>I mean, he suddenly says, "Father."</i>
7091317 7096363 <i>He's in touch with Darth Vader<br />suddenly through the air-telepathy.</i>
7101827 7103954 <i>While we were editing-</i>
7104038 7106624 <i>I did the first editing in London...</i>
7106707 7110544 <i>and then brought it to California...</i>
7111670 7114298 <i>where they'd set up<br />a beautiful editing room.</i>
7114882 7118552 <i>And Ben Burtt was on the first floor.</i>
7118636 7120262 <i>I was on the second floor.</i>
7121055 7122765 <i>They built me a great editing room</i>
7122848 7125601 <i>with a kitchen and couches<br />and a fireplace,</i>
7125684 7127728 <i>and wood was brought to the fireplace,</i>
7127811 7131357 <i>and I was spending many long hours<br />in that editing room.</i>
7131440 7134443 <i>But whenever I needed<br />a piece of sound,</i>
7134568 7139073 <i>I could go down,<br />and Ben would create it, you see?</i>
7139198 7140783 <i>Or find something.</i>
7141700 7144119 <i>I began to realize<br />that he could do things</i>
7144203 7147206 <i>that I'd never seen done<br />before with sound.</i>
7155255 7158091 KEN RALSTON: <i>At the end<br />of</i> Empire <i>there's the scene-</i>
7158174 7160152 <i>it's called the hospital ship,<br />and Luke is getting repaired...</i>
7160176 7162428 <i>'cause he's had his battle with Darth<br />and lost his hand.</i>
7162512 7164347 <i>Now he gets the mechanical hand.</i>
7164430 7166516 <i>And everyone is together once again,</i>
7166599 7169852 <i>and you see a whole<br />fleet of ships flying away.</i>
7169936 7171646 <i>And we did a lot of blue screen ships,</i>
7171729 7175817 <i>very complicated, strange-shaped ships<br />that had to be lit very specifically.</i>
7175942 7178486 <i>Lot of work went into it.</i>
7178570 7181114 <i>And we were done with the movie.<br />It was terrific.</i>
7181239 7183616 <i>And we had a big wrap party.</i>
7183741 7186911 <i>It was great.<br />We saw the movie, and it was exciting,</i>
7187453 7189723 <i>and we were very proud<br />of all the work everyone had done...</i>
7189747 7191624 <i>and put so many long hours into.</i>
7191749 7193543 <i>The film was about to come out. Great.</i>
7193626 7196421 <i>I left on vacation,<br />and I get a phone call-</i>
7196504 7198548 <i>"George wants to add<br />some more shots."</i>
7199340 7201050 <i>And I said-</i> [LAUGHS]
7201134 7203219 <i>"That's funny. That's a good joke."</i>
7203303 7204804 <i>It wasn't a joke.</i>
7204887 7206848 <i>The film is coming out<br />in like three weeks,</i>
7206931 7209684 <i>and they wound up doing<br />like two or three more shots...</i>
7209767 7212770 <i>for the end of the film to take a little<br />longer in wrapping it up.</i>
7212854 7214856 <i>You never know. You can never let</i>
7214939 7216625 <i>your guard down for a minute<br />on these films,</i>
7216649 7218359 <i>because anything can happen.</i>
7225617 7228036 BURTT: <i>Sound people<br />always appreciate the fact...</i>
7228161 7231414 <i>that the face of this medical droid<br />taking care of Luke-</i>
7231497 7235960 <i>his nose and his mouth there<br />is an old Shure microphone.</i>
7237003 7239005 <i>Used to be the studio standard<br />many years back,</i>
7239088 7241174 <i>and it was built into his face.</i>
7241257 7243843 <i>I might be wrong.<br />It might be an Electro-Voice.</i>
7243926 7247096 <i>It was a standard microphone of the<br />recording generation before mine.</i>
7247889 7250350 <i>It's what you would have seen...</i>
7250433 7256481 <i>Bob Hope on his world tour using,<br />or something like that.</i>
7257398 7260735 <i>I should know what it is.<br />I'd never used one myself.</i>
7260818 7264822 <i>It was before my time.<br />Just before my time.</i>
7270662 7274791 MUREN: <i>And the big nebula that you<br />see outside the window near the end...</i>
7274874 7280880 <i>is actually a lot of talcum powder<br />put onto a black disk.</i>
7282256 7287261 <i>So a little talcum powder there sort of<br />rotating on a lazy Susan, you could say.</i>
7287345 7289722 <i>Slowly rotated to look like<br />it's a nice nebula.</i>
7289806 7292433 <i>To sort of give you a feeling<br />of optimism in the future.</i>
7293184 7296187 <i>Those guys were shot against<br />blue screen in front of that.</i>
7296270 7299524 <i>Or just shot in front of a blue screen,<br />and then the background put in.</i>
7301275 7304362 <i>Kind of a variation<br />on the Andromeda galaxy.</i>
7304445 7306239 <i>Probably about<br />two or three feet across.</i>
7306364 7309617 <i>There was projector projecting<br />a little image about two inches wide...</i>
7309742 7312704 <i>into the back of that model spaceship.</i>
7312787 7316708 <i>It's probably six or eight feet long,<br />and the camera drifting by it.</i>
7318209 7320354 <i>We repeated the camera motion<br />for all those other ships,</i>
7320378 7323058 <i>which is how they all look like<br />they're going in the same direction.</i>
7324298 7326426 KERSHNER:<br /><i>With Johnny Williams going to town.</i>
7326509 7328094 <i>What a great composer.</i>
7328177 7330471 <i>He wore out the trombones.</i>
7330596 7332890 <i>They had to stop.<br />They were splitting their lips...</i>
7332974 7335476 <i>they had so much work on this-<br />on the recording.</i>
7347279 7352701 <i>George said, "I want to give you<br />a little gift at the end of this film."</i>
7352784 7354369 <i>I said, "Gee, that's nice."</i>
7354453 7357056 <i>He says, "You've always talked about<br />going to Japan. You never went."</i>
7357080 7361168 <i>I said, "No."<br />He says, "Well, go to Japan...</i>
7361251 7365547 <i>and do what you want to do there,<br />see what you want to see...</i>
7366298 7368133 <i>"and send me the bill."</i>
7369176 7371219 <i>And it was a big bill.</i>
7371887 7375724 <i>Because I went to Tokyo.<br />I went to five different cities.</i>
7375807 7379269 <i>I flew first-class on Japan Airlines.</i>
7379352 7381188 <i>I had a bed on the airliner.</i>
7381271 7383106 <i>I stayed at the Imperial Hotel.</i>
7383190 7384775 <i>I ate the best food.</i>
7384858 7386943 <i>Sent him the bill, and it was paid.</i>
7387027 7389279 <i>And that was his gift. Not bad.</i>
7390113 7392657 FORD: <i>It is amazing what you can do<br />when you have a vision...</i>
7392783 7394409 <i>and when you have an ambition...</i>
7394493 7398497 <i>and when you can bend<br />other people's will to your desire.</i>
7398622 7402751 <i>Despite the enormous difficulties<br />of the production of</i> Star Wars,
7402834 7406880 <i>the thing that kept it focused<br />and directed-</i>
7406963 7410258 <i>I use the word in several terms-<br />towards the ambitions...</i>
7410342 7413261 <i>was George's vision<br />and his passion for the idea.</i>
7413345 7417474 KERSHNER: <i>To make a picture this big,<br />this complex,</i>
7417557 7419100 <i>you need a team.</i>
7419184 7423563 <i>And I must say, I think I had the best<br />team it's possible to have on a film.</i>
7424564 7426983 <i>There was complete cooperation.</i>
7427067 7430153 <i>Everybody loved what they were doing,<br />no matter how difficult it was.</i>
7430237 7433657 <i>At least they appeared to love<br />what they were doing.</i>
7434324 7439704 <i>It was tough, but we all felt<br />that we were doing something good.</i>
