213479 215413 Echo Three to Echo Seven.
215481 217415 Han, old buddy,<br />do you read me?
217483 219417 <i>Loud and clear, kid.</i><br /><i>What's up?
219485 220474 I finished<br />my circle.
220553 222248 I don't pick up<br />any life readings.
222322 224187 <i>There isn't enough life</i><br /><i>on this ice cube...
224257 225690 <i>to fill a space cruiser.
225758 227589 <i>Sensors are placed.</i><br /><i>I'm going back.
227660 229423 Right.<br />I'll see you shortly.
229495 231395 There's a meteorite<br />that hit the ground near here.
231464 233898 I want to check it out.<br />It won't take long.
235401 237892 Steady, girl.<br />What's the matter?
237971 239996 You smell something?
240073 241370 Rrraaah!
280480 281947 Chewie!
282015 284415 Chewie?
284484 285781 Chewie!
288855 290447 All right!<br />Don't lose your temper.
290523 292718 I'll come right back<br />and give you a hand.
313379 314505 Solo?
314580 316878 No sign of life<br />out there, General.
316949 318280 The sensors are in place.
318351 319511 You'll know if anything<br />comes around.
319585 321177 Commander Skywalker<br />reported in yet?
321254 323484 No. He's checking out<br />a meteorite that hit near him.
323556 325649 With all the meteor activity<br />in this system...
325725 327454 it's going to be difficult<br />to spot approaching ships.
327527 329791 General, I got to leave.<br />I can't stay anymore.
329862 330886 I'm sorry to hear that.
330963 332123 Well, there's<br />a price on my head.
332198 333631 If I don't pay off<br />Jabba the Hutt...
333700 334962 I'm a dead man.
335034 337161 A death mark's<br />not an easy thing to live with.
337236 338669 You're a good fighter, Solo.
338738 340763 I hate to lose you.
340840 342740 Thank you, General.
349615 352880 Well, Your Highness,<br />guess this is it.
352952 354886 That's right.
354954 358412 Well, don't get<br />all mushy on me.
358491 360152 So long, Princess.
362228 364992 Han!
365064 366998 Yes, Your Highnessness?
367066 369125 I thought you had<br />decided to stay.
369202 371193 Well, the bounty hunter<br />we ran into in Ord Mantell...
371270 372202 changed my mind.
372271 374330 Han, we need you!
374407 375339 <i>We</i> need?
375408 376500 Yes.
376576 377508 Well, what about<br /><i>you</i> need?
377577 378669 <i>I</i> need?
378745 381009 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
381080 382877 You probably don't.
382949 384746 And what precisely<br />am I supposed to know?
384817 386648 Come on!
386719 389017 You want me to stay<br />because of the way you feel about me.
389088 390783 Yes! You're<br />a great help to us.
390857 391789 You're a natural leader.
391858 394486 No! That's not it.
394560 395993 Come on.
396062 397427 A-ha!
397497 399021 You're imagining things.
399098 400895 Am I? Then why are<br />you following me?
400967 403902 Afraid I was gonna leave<br />without giving you a good-bye kiss?
403970 405403 I'd just as soon<br />kiss a Wookiee!
405471 406904 I can arrange that.
406973 408964 You could use<br />a good kiss!
410209 413406 I didn't ask you to turn on<br />the thermal heater.
413479 416915 I merely commented that it was freezing<br />in the princess's chamber.
416983 419417 How will we<br />dry out her clothes?
420486 422078 Oh, switch off!
422155 423520 Why did you<br />take this apart now?
423589 425352 I'm trying to get us out of here,<br />and you pull both...
425425 426824 Excuse me, sir.
426893 427951 Put them<br />back together now!
428027 428891 Might I have a word<br />with you, please?
428961 429893 What do you want?
429962 431054 Well, it's Princess Leia, sir.
431130 432062 She's been trying to get you<br />on the communicator.
432131 433063 I turned it off.
433132 434895 I don't want<br />to talk to her.
434967 436935 Well, Princess Leia is wondering<br />about Master Luke.
437003 437935 He hasn't<br />come back yet.
438004 438936 She doesn't know<br />where he is.
439005 439937 I don't know<br />where he is.
440006 440973 Nobody knows<br />where he is.
441040 442405 What do you mean,<br />nobody knows?
442475 444409 - Well, uh, you see...<br />- Deck Officer!
444477 445910 - Deck Officer!<br />- Excuse me, sir, might I...
445978 446967 Yes, sir?
447046 448411 Do you know where<br />Commander Skywalker is?
448481 449914 I haven't seen him.
449982 451449 It's possible he came through<br />the south entrance.
451517 452449 It's <i>possible?
452518 454179 Why don't you<br />go find out?
454253 455311 It's getting<br />dark out there.
455388 456685 Yes, sir.
456756 458917 Excuse me, sir.<br />Might I inquire what's going on?
458991 460219 Why not?
460293 461419 Impossible man.
461494 462927 Come along, R2,<br />let's find Princess Leia.
462995 464189 Between ourselves...
464263 466891 I think Master Luke is<br />in considerable danger.
476476 478671 Sir, Commander Skywalker<br />hasn't come in the south entrance.
478744 479870 He might have<br />forgotten to check in.
479946 481311 Not likely.<br />Are the speeders ready?
481380 483507 Uh, not yet. We're having trouble<br />adapting them to the cold.
483583 484743 We'll have to go out<br />on tauntauns.
484817 486580 Sir, the temperature's<br />dropping too rapidly.
486652 488950 That's right,<br />and my friend's out in it.
493159 495821 Your tauntaun will freeze<br />before you reach the first marker.
495895 497920 Then I'll see you<br />in hell. Hyah!
521454 523979 Rrraaah!
582381 583780 Grrrr!
626626 628389 You must<br />come along now, R2.
628461 630486 There's really<br />nothing more we can do.
630563 632929 And my joints<br />are freezing up.
634000 635331 Don't say things<br />like that!
635401 636925 Of course we'll see<br />Master Luke again.
637003 639437 And he'll be quite<br />all right.
639505 640437 You'll see.
640506 642406 Stupid little short circuit.
642475 644568 He'll be quite all right.
701801 704031 Sir, all the patrols<br />are in.
704103 705092 Still no...
706205 709106 Still no contact<br />from Skywalker or Solo.
709175 712838 Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been<br />quite unable to pick up any signals...
712912 715745 although he does admit<br />that his own range is far too weak...
715815 717180 to abandon all hope.
717249 719080 Your Highness, there's nothing more<br />we can do tonight.
719151 721449 The shield doors<br />must be closed.
722822 723754 Close the doors.
723823 724755 Yes, sir.
726759 731787 R2 says the chances<br />of survival are 725 to 1.
740473 741770 Gahhh!
741841 746540 Actually, R2 has been known<br />to make mistakes...
749548 751482 from time to time.
751550 753040 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
756055 757989 Don't worry<br />about Master Luke.
758057 759490 I'm sure<br />he'll be all right.
759558 762049 He's quite clever, you know,<br />for a human being.
777676 779075 <i>Luke.
781680 783011 <i>Luke.
790523 792081 Ben?
792158 794820 <i>You will go to</i><br /><i>the Dagobah system.
794894 796691 Dagobah system?
796762 799595 <i>There you will</i><br /><i>learn from Yoda...
799665 804159 <i>the Jedi master</i><br /><i>who instructed me.
804236 806136 Ben!
806205 807467 Ben!
811710 813143 Luke!
813212 815612 Luke!
822188 824122 Don't do this, Luke.
824190 827626 Come on,<br />give me a sign here.
848948 850711 Not much time.
850783 852045 Ben.
852117 854381 Ben.
858090 859717 Hang on, kid.
860893 862986 Dagobah system.
863062 864051 Whew!
864129 867098 This may smell bad, kid...
867166 869157 Yoda.
869235 870930 but it'll keep you warm...
871003 873301 till I get the shelter built.
875975 877670 Ahhh!
877743 883079 Ah! I thought they<br />smelled bad on the outside!
925891 928416 Echo Base, I've got something.
928494 931588 Not much, but it could be a life-form.
935534 937968 Commander Skywalker,<br />do you copy?
938037 939971 This is Rogue Two.
940039 942507 This is Rogue Two.
942574 946237 Captain Solo,<br />do you copy?
951050 954918 Commander Skywalker,<br />do you copy?
954987 957455 This is Rogue Two.
957523 958956 <i>Good morning.
959024 961424 <i>Nice of you guys</i><br /><i>to drop by.
961493 963893 Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
963963 965396 I've found them.
965464 967295 Repeat, I've found them.
997529 1001226 Master Luke, sir, it's so good<br />to see you fully functional again.
1002301 1004064 R2 expresses<br />his relief also.
1004136 1006934 How ya feelin', kid?<br />You don't look so bad to me.
1007006 1008439 You look strong enough...
1008507 1010441 to pull the ears<br />off a gundark.
1010509 1011942 Thanks to you.
1012011 1014639 That's two<br />you owe me, junior.
1014713 1016305 Well, Your Worship...
1016382 1019249 looks like you managed to keep me<br />around for a little while longer.
1019318 1020910 I had nothing<br />to do with it.
1020986 1022783 General Rieekan<br />thinks it's dangerous...
1022855 1024049 for any ships<br />to leave the system...
1024123 1025488 until we've activated<br />the energy field.
1025557 1027491 That's a good story.
1027559 1028787 <i>I</i> think you just can't bear...
1028861 1031523 to let a gorgeous guy like me<br />out of your sight.
1031597 1034930 I don't know where you get<br />your delusions, laser brain.
1035000 1036695 Hah hah hah!
1038003 1039937 Laugh it up, fuzzball...
1040005 1043441 but you didn't see us alone<br />in the south passage.
1043509 1046000 She expressed her<br />true feelings for me.
1046078 1047443 My...
1047513 1050505 Why, you stuck-up,<br />half-witted...
1050582 1053176 scruffy-looking<br />nerf herder!
1053252 1056346 Who's scruffy-looking?
1058791 1060952 I must have hit<br />pretty close to the mark...
1061026 1063085 to get her all riled up<br />like that, huh, kid?
1066532 1070024 Well, I guess you don't know<br />everything about women yet.
1075040 1078441 <i>Headquarters personnel,</i><br /><i>report to command center.
1081246 1084477 <i>Headquarters personnel,</i><br /><i>report to command center.
1084550 1085574 Take it easy.
1085651 1088051 Excuse us,<br />please.
1090923 1093084 Princess,<br />we have a visitor.
1093158 1096855 Picked up something outside<br />the base's Zone 12 moving east.
1096929 1098089 It's metal.
1098163 1099152 Then it couldn't be<br />one of those creatures.
1099231 1100079 Could be a speeder,<br />one of ours.
1100114 1100927 Could be a speeder,<br />one of ours.
1100999 1102261 No.
1102334 1103426 Wait.
1103502 1106164 There's something<br />very weak coming through.
1109475 1112603 Sir, I'm fluent in six million<br />forms of communication.
1112678 1115442 This signal is not used<br />by the Alliance.
1115514 1117607 It could be<br />an imperial code.
1121053 1122850 It isn't friendly,<br />whatever it is.
1122921 1124855 Come on, Chewie,<br />let's check it out.
1124923 1128188 Send Rogues 10 and 11<br />to Station 38.
1144409 1145671 Grrr!
1159491 1161288 Gahhh!
1163128 1164390 <i>I'm afraid</i><br /><i>there's not much left.
1164463 1165395 What was it?
1165464 1166931 <i>Droid of some kind.
1166999 1168933 <i>I didn't hit it that hard.</i><br /><i>Must've had a self-destruct.
1169001 1170798 An imperial probe droid.
1170869 1173895 <i>It's a good bet the Empire</i><br /><i>knows we're here.
1173972 1175963 We'd better start<br />the evacuation.
1220352 1222149 Admiral.
1222221 1223654 Yes, Captain?
1223722 1225952 I think we've got<br />something, sir.
1226024 1228117 The report<br />is only a fragment...
1228193 1229785 from a probe droid<br />in the Hoth system...
1229861 1231328 but it's the best lead we've had.
1231396 1234263 We have thousands of probe droids<br />searching the galaxy.
1234333 1235459 I want proof,<br />not leads.
1235534 1237468 The visuals indicate<br />life readings.
1237536 1238468 It could mean anything.
1238537 1239868 If we followed up<br />every lead...
1239938 1241303 But, sir...
1241373 1242965 the Hoth system is supposed to be<br />devoid of humans.
1243041 1244269 You've found something?
1244343 1245469 Yes, my lord.
1247879 1250245 That's it.<br />The rebels are there.
1250315 1254809 My lord, there are so many<br />uncharted settlements.
1254886 1255818 It could be smugglers...
1255887 1257718 That is the system.
1257789 1260223 And I'm sure Skywalker<br />is with them.
1260292 1263318 Set your course<br />for the Hoth system.
1263395 1265625 General Veers,<br />prepare your men.
1265697 1267130 Admiral.
1274039 1276166 Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind<br />to fly the speeders.
1276241 1277833 As soon as each transport is loaded...
1277909 1280070 evacuation control will give clearance<br />for immediate launch.
1280145 1281134 Right, sir.
1284216 1286343 All right!<br />That's it.
1286418 1287476 Try it.
1289288 1292416 Oh! Turn it off!<br />Turn it off!
1292491 1294686 Turn it off!
1294760 1298457 Sir, it will take quite a while<br />to evacuate the T-47s.
1298530 1299462 Forget<br />the heavy equipment.
1299531 1300759 There's plenty of time...
1300832 1302459 to get the smaller modules<br />on the transports.
1302534 1303466 Take care, sir.
1303535 1304524 Thanks.
1307539 1310702 Chewie, take care<br />of yourself, OK?
1314246 1316146 OK, OK!
1317716 1319183 Hi, kid.
1319251 1320343 There's got to be<br />a reason for it.
1320419 1321818 Check it<br />at the other end.
1321887 1323081 Wait a second.
1324222 1325621 You all right?
1325691 1327022 Yeah.
1333398 1335730 Be careful.
1335801 1337564 You, too.
1342574 1345475 General, there's a fleet<br />of Stardestroyers...
1345544 1348479 coming out of hyperspace<br />in Sector Four.
1348547 1351482 Reroute all power<br />to the energy shield.
1351550 1354485 We gotta hold them till<br />all transports are away.
1354553 1356043 Prepare for ground assault.
1370035 1371969 What is it, General?
1372037 1373664 My lord, the fleet has moved out<br />of light speed.
1373739 1375934 ComScan has detected<br />an energy field...
1376007 1378441 protecting an area of the sixth planet<br />of the Hoth system.
1378510 1381172 The field is strong enough<br />to deflect any bombardment.
1381246 1383942 The rebels are alerted<br />to our presence.
1384015 1386950 Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed<br />too close to the system.
1387018 1388952 He... He felt surprise<br />was wiser.
1389020 1391545 He is as clumsy<br />as he is stupid.
1391623 1394956 General, prepare your troops<br />for a surface attack.
1395026 1396516 Yes, my lord.
1403535 1405127 Lord Vader.
1405203 1407467 The fleet has moved out of light speed,<br />and we're preparing to...
1407539 1409200 Aaugh!
1409274 1412971 You have failed me<br />for the last time, Admiral.
1413044 1414272 Captain Piett.
1414346 1415973 Yes, my lord?
1416047 1419073 Make ready to land our troops<br />beyond their energy field...
1419151 1422143 and deploy the fleet so that<br />nothing gets off the system.
1422220 1425485 You are in command now,<br />Admiral Piett.
1425557 1426990 Thank you,<br />Lord Vader.
1429327 1431921 All troop carriers will assemble<br />at the north entrance.
1431997 1434795 The heavy transport ships will leave<br />as soon as they're loaded.
1434866 1437061 Only two fighter escorts<br />per ship.
1437135 1439899 The energy shield can only be opened<br />for a short time...
1439971 1442439 so you'll have to stay very close<br />to your transports.
1442507 1444941 Two fighters against<br />a Stardestroyer?
1445010 1447444 The ion cannon<br />will fire several shots...
1447512 1450538 to make sure that any enemy ships<br />will be out of your flight path.
1450615 1452742 When you've gotten past<br />the energy shield...
1452818 1454945 proceed directly<br />to the rendezvous point.
1455020 1456453 Understood?
1456521 1457954 Good luck.
1458023 1459957 OK Everybody<br />to your stations.
1460025 1461253 Let's go.
1478343 1481744 Their primary target will be<br />the power generators.
1481813 1483440 Prepare to open shield.
1489221 1491485 Sir, rebel ships are<br />coming into our sector.
1491556 1493649 Good. Our first catch<br />of the day.
1495360 1497294 Stand by, ion control.
1498797 1499821 Fire.
1513812 1518146 <i>The first transport is away.
1518216 1521652 <i>The first transport is away.
1527459 1529359 Feeling all right, sir?
1529427 1531190 Just like new, Dak.<br />How about you?
1531263 1534357 Right now I feel I could take on<br />the whole Empire myself.
1534432 1536593 I know what you mean.
1554920 1556080 Echo Station<br />Three-T-Eight.
1556154 1557917 We've spotted<br />imperial walkers.
1557989 1560287 <i>Imperial walkers</i><br /><i>on the north ridge.
1582881 1585247 Echo Station Five-Seven.<br />We're on our way.
1590622 1592647 All right, boys,<br />keep tight now.
1592724 1594919 Luke, I have no approach vector.<br />I'm not set.
1594993 1596483 Steady, Dak.
1596561 1598461 Attack pattern Delta.<br />Go now.
1602200 1603895 All right.<br />I'm coming in.
1608373 1610534 Hobbie,<br />you still with me?
1632163 1634324 That armor's too strong<br />for blasters.
1636735 1638965 Rogue Group,<br />use your harpoons and tow cables.
1639037 1642837 Go for the legs. It might be<br />our only chance of stopping them.
1642907 1644875 All right.<br />Stand by, Dak.
1644943 1647810 Oh, Luke, we've got a malfunction<br />in fire control.
1647879 1649904 I'll have to cut in<br />the auxiliary.
1649981 1652609 Just hang on.<br />Hang on, Dak.
1652684 1654845 Get ready to fire<br />that tow cable.
1657022 1658011 Ah!
1660225 1661214 Dak?
1661292 1662350 Dak!
1685316 1688308 Yes, Lord Vader, I've reached<br />the main power generators.
1688386 1689876 The shield will be down<br />in moments.
1689954 1692684 You may start your landing.
1695827 1697692 Rogue Three.
1697762 1698956 Copy, Rogue Leader.
1699030 1700930 Wedge, I've lost my gunner.
1700999 1702330 You'll have to<br />make this shot.
1702400 1704163 I'll cover for you.
1704235 1707727 Set your harpoon.<br />Follow me on the next pass.
1707806 1709774 Coming around,<br />Rogue Leader.
1712610 1715010 Steady, Rogue Two.
1715080 1716172 Activate harpoon.
1719117 1720675 Good shot, Janson.
1726658 1729024 - One more pass.<br />- Coming around, Wedge.
1734532 1736864 Cable out.<br />Let her go!
1736935 1738800 Detach cable.
1738870 1740064 Cable detached.
1747879 1749574 Come on.
1756554 1758078 Hah! That got him!
1758156 1759987 I see it, Wedge.<br />Good work.
1760191 1761385 I don't think...
1761459 1762756 we can protect<br />two transports at a time.
1762827 1764920 It's risky, but we can't<br />hold out much longer.
1764996 1767430 We have no choice.
1767499 1768431 Launch patrol.
1768500 1770400 Evacuate remaining ground staff.
1770468 1771992 Gahhh!
1772070 1774538 No, no! No.
1774606 1776540 This one goes there.
1776608 1778803 That one goes there, right?
1778877 1782813 R2, you take good care<br />of Master Luke now, understand?
1784015 1786347 And do take good care<br />of yourself.
1790021 1791579 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
1815346 1817541 All troops will debark<br />for ground assault.
1817615 1820311 Prepare to target<br />the main generator.
1823922 1824911 Rogue Two,<br />are you all right?
1824989 1827457 Yeah. I'm with you,<br />Rogue Leader.
1827525 1829390 Well, set harpoon.<br />I'll cover for you.
1830929 1832328 Coming around.
1832397 1835230 Watch that cross fire, boys.
1835300 1837165 Set for<br />position three.
1837235 1838566 Steady.
1838636 1839967 Stay tight and low.
1841272 1842569 Aah!
1846678 1848339 Hobbie!
1848413 1849903 I've been hit!
1892056 1893455 You all right?
1893524 1895492 Why are you<br />still here?
1895560 1897460 Heard the command center had been hit.
1897528 1898460 You've got<br />your clearance to leave.
1898529 1900429 Don't worry. I'll leave.
1900498 1902227 First I'm gonna<br />get you to your ship.
1902300 1903961 Your Highness,<br />we must take this last transport.
1904035 1904967 It's our only hope.
1905036 1906196 Send all troops<br />in Sector 12...
1906271 1908432 to the south slope<br />to protect the fighters.
1910041 1912032 <i>Imperial troops</i><br /><i>have entered the base.
1912110 1913509 <i>Imperial troops</i><br /><i>have entered...
1913578 1915136 Come on.<br />That's it.
1915213 1917807 Give the evacuation<br />code signal.
1920218 1921583 And get to your transports!
1921653 1923587 Oh! Wait for me!
1923655 1926123 Begin retreat!
1926190 1927179 Fall back!
1985783 1987683 Distance to power generators?
1987752 1989117 <i>17.28.
1998196 2000164 Target.<br />Maximum firepower.
2025790 2027883 Transport, this is Solo.
2027959 2029119 Better take off.<br />I can't get to you.
2029193 2031127 I'll get her out<br />on the <i>Falcon.
2032530 2034657 B-B-But where are<br />you going?
2034732 2035824 Come back!
2052984 2054645 Wait!
2054719 2056653 Wait for me!<br />Wait! Stop!
2056721 2058154 How typical.
2058222 2059689 Come on.
2059757 2061554 Gahhh!
2063261 2064523 Hurry up, goldenrod.
2064595 2066893 You're gonna be<br />a permanent resident.
2066964 2068397 Wait! Wait!
2086284 2087342 How's this?
2087418 2089477 Would it help<br />if I got out and pushed?
2089554 2090816 Captain Solo!<br />Captain Solo!
2090888 2091820 It might.
2093057 2095787 Sir, might I suggest<br />that you...
2095860 2097589 It can wait.
2101766 2104064 This bucket of bolts is never gonna<br />get us past that blockade.
2104135 2106501 This baby's got a few surprises<br />left in her, sweetheart.
2114846 2117041 Come on! Come on!
2117115 2119743 Switch over.<br />Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
2122353 2123285 See?
2123354 2124286 Someday you're<br />gonna be wrong...
2124355 2125686 and I just hope<br />I'm there to see it.
2128526 2129686 Punch it!
2147311 2148801 R2!
2148880 2152509 Get her ready<br />for takeoff.
2152583 2156986 Good luck, Luke.<br />See you at the rendezvous.
2158556 2160581 Don't worry, R2.
2160658 2162592 We're going.<br />We're going.
2174972 2176462 There's nothing wrong, R2.
2176541 2178634 I'm just setting<br />a new course.
2181279 2183907 We're not gonna regroup<br />with the others.
2183981 2186245 We're going<br />to the Dagobah system.
2188219 2190084 Yes, R2?
2191756 2193417 That's all right.
2193491 2195982 I'd like to keep it<br />on manual control for a while.
2210107 2212575 Gahhh!
2212643 2213837 I saw 'em! I saw 'em!
2213911 2215071 Saw what?
2215146 2217376 Stardestroyers,<br />two of 'em coming right at us.
2217448 2218574 Sir! Sir!
2218649 2219581 Might I suggest...
2219650 2221948 Shut him up<br />or shut him down!
2222019 2224044 Check the deflector shield.
2224121 2226055 Great.
2226123 2228216 Well, we can still<br />outmaneuver them.
2232496 2234430 Take evasive action!
2246010 2247875 Prepare to make the jump to light speed.
2247945 2248877 But, sir!
2248946 2251574 They're getting closer.
2251649 2253810 Oh, yeah?<br />Watch this.
2256887 2258115 Watch what?
2260057 2261149 I think we're<br />in trouble.
2261225 2263193 If I may say so, sir,<br />I noticed earlier...
2263261 2264922 the hyperdrive motivator<br />has been damaged.
2264996 2266793 It's impossible to go<br />to light speed.
2266864 2269458 We're in trouble.
2272670 2273967 Horizontal boosters!
2274038 2276006 Gahhh!
2276073 2278166 Alluvial dampers.
2278242 2279937 Ow!
2280011 2281979 That's not it.
2282046 2283638 Bring me<br />the hydrospanner!
2285583 2289019 I don't know how we're gonna<br />get out of this one.
2291322 2292584 Ow!
2292657 2293783 Chewie!
2297928 2299486 That wasn't a laser blast.<br />Something hit us.
2299563 2301030 Han, get up here!
2302700 2304190 Come on, Chewie!
2304535 2306025 Asteroids.
2306103 2309561 Oh, no.
2309640 2311073 Chewie,<br />set two-seven-one.
2311142 2312609 What are you doing?
2312677 2316306 You're not actually going<br />into an asteroid field?
2316380 2319247 They'd be crazy to follow us,<br />wouldn't they?
2321352 2323320 You don't have to do this<br />to impress me.
2323387 2325981 Sir, the possibility of successfully<br />navigating an asteroid field...
2326057 2328184 is approximately 3,720 to 1.
2328259 2329988 Never tell me the odds!
2352149 2353912 Look out!
2356487 2359923 You said you wanted to be around<br />when I made a mistake.
2359990 2361855 This could be it,<br />sweetheart.
2361926 2362858 I take it back.
2362927 2364519 We're going<br />to get pulverized...
2364595 2365960 if we stay out here<br />much longer.
2366030 2367258 Ain't gonna argue with that.
2367331 2369925 I'm going in closer<br />to one of the big ones.
2370000 2370898 Closer?!
2370968 2371900 Closer?!
2371969 2373061 Gahhh!
2398963 2400897 Oh, this is suicide!
2400965 2402956 There. That looks<br />pretty good.
2403033 2405228 What looks pretty good?
2405302 2407236 Yeah,<br />that'll do nicely.
2407304 2410432 Excuse me, ma'am,<br />but where are we going?
2420351 2422945 I hope you know<br />what you're doing.
2423020 2424146 Yeah. Me, too.
2432797 2435231 Yep, that's it.<br />Dagobah.
2437635 2439899 No, I'm not gonna change<br />my mind about this.
2439970 2443303 I'm not picking up<br />any cities or technology.
2443374 2445968 Massive life-form<br />readings, though.
2446043 2448603 There's something alive<br />down there.
2450214 2453149 Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
2459690 2461681 I know! I know!
2461759 2465286 All the scopes are dead.<br />I can't see a thing.
2465362 2466659 Just hang on.
2466730 2468527 I'm gonna start<br />the landing cycle.
2522353 2523479 No, R2, you stay put.
2523554 2525317 I'll have a look around.
2529760 2532058 R2?
2532129 2533061 R2!
2535065 2536089 Where are you?
2539570 2541060 R2!
2548078 2549511 You be more careful.
2552483 2555350 R2, that way.
2583347 2584746 R2!
2599363 2600990 <i>Beeep!
2612443 2613842 Oh, no.
2613911 2615845 Are you all right?
2615913 2617346 Come on.
2620551 2622781 You're lucky you don't<br />taste very good.
2622853 2624912 Anything broken?
2628525 2631289 If you're saying<br />coming here was a bad idea...
2631362 2632795 I'm beginning<br />to agree with you.
2634465 2636626 R2, what are<br />we doing here?
2636700 2642229 It's like... something<br />out of a dream or...
2642306 2643933 I don't know.
2644008 2646408 Maybe I'm<br />just going crazy.
2677941 2679636 Yes, Admiral?
2679710 2682543 Our ships have sighted<br />the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> lord...
2682613 2685741 but it has entered an asteroid field,<br />and we cannot risk...
2685816 2687977 Asteroids do not<br />concern me, Admiral.
2688052 2691283 I want that ship,<br />not excuses.
2691355 2693448 Yes, lord.
2697394 2699419 I'm gonna shut down<br />everything...
2699496 2701396 but the emergency<br />power systems.
2701465 2705526 Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask,<br />but does that include shutting me down, too?
2705602 2707934 No. I need you to talk<br />to the <i>Falcon.
2708005 2711099 Find out what's wrong<br />with the hyperdrive.
2717781 2721217 Sir, it's quite possible<br />this asteroid is not entirely stable.
2721285 2723651 Not entirely stable?
2723721 2725416 I'm glad you're here<br />to tell us these things.
2725489 2727252 Chewie, take the professor<br />in the back...
2727324 2728951 and plug him into<br />the hyperdrive.
2729026 2731961 Sometimes I just don't<br />understand human behavior.
2732029 2734429 After all, I'm only<br />trying to do my job.
2739236 2740635 - Let go.<br />- Shh!
2742473 2743735 Let go, please.
2743807 2745138 Don't get excited.
2745209 2746676 Captain, being held by you...
2746744 2749008 isn't quite enough<br />to get me excited.
2749079 2750512 Sorry, sweetheart.
2750581 2753414 I haven't got time<br />for anything else.
2788051 2789848 Ready for<br />some power?
2789920 2791615 O.K.
2794925 2796358 Let's see now.
2796426 2798257 Put that in there.
2798328 2799454 There you go.
2801098 2805194 Now all I gotta do<br />is find this Yoda...
2805269 2806759 if he even exists.
2812943 2817073 It's really a strange place<br />to find a Jedi master.
2817147 2819479 This place<br />gives me the creeps.
2823086 2826180 Still...
2826256 2828121 there's something familiar<br />about this place.
2830294 2831761 I don't know.
2831829 2832989 I feel like...
2833063 2835293 Feel like what?
2835365 2837026 Like we're<br />being watched!
2837100 2838931 Away put your weapon!
2839002 2841061 I mean you no harm.
2841138 2844073 I am wondering...<br />why are you here?
2844141 2847167 I'm looking<br />for someone.
2847244 2848677 Looking?
2848745 2851543 Found someone you have,<br />I would say, hmmm?
2851615 2854311 Right.
2854384 2857649 Help you I can.<br />Yes, mmmm.
2857721 2859712 I don't think so.
2859790 2862725 I'm looking<br />for a great warrior.
2862793 2864055 Ah!
2864127 2865992 A great warrior.
2866063 2868497 Ha ha ha!
2868565 2870965 Wars not<br />make one great.
2878876 2880707 Put that down.
2880777 2883268 Hey! That's my dinner!
2885983 2889316 How you get so big<br />eating food of this kind?
2889386 2891980 Listen, friend, we didn't mean<br />to land in that puddle.
2892055 2893283 And if we could get<br />our ship out, we would.
2893357 2894449 But we can't,<br />so why don't you...
2894524 2896458 Cannot get your ship out.<br />Hee hee hee!
2896526 2897891 Hey, get out of there!
2897961 2899326 Ah!
2899396 2901455 No! Ooh!
2901531 2903897 Hey, you could<br />have broken this.
2903967 2906128 Don't do that.
2907905 2909463 Oh!
2916413 2918404 You're making a mess.
2920417 2922248 Hey, give me that!
2922319 2924913 Mine, or I will<br />help you not.
2924988 2926819 I don't want your help.<br />I want my lamp back.
2926890 2928949 I'm gonna need it<br />to get out of this slimy mudhole.
2929026 2930459 Mudhole? Slimy?
2930527 2933189 My home this is...
2933263 2935754 Wha... Mmm!
2935832 2937459 R2, let him have it.
2939403 2941803 Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!
2941872 2942964 R2!
2945309 2947641 Now, will you move along,<br />little fellow?
2947711 2949406 We've got a lot<br />of work to do.
2949479 2950969 No! No, no!
2951048 2954484 Stay and help you I will...<br />find your friend.
2954551 2956883 I'm not looking<br />for a friend.
2956954 2958251 I'm looking<br />for a Jedi master.
2958322 2962622 Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.
2962693 2964183 You seek Yoda.
2964261 2965455 You know him?
2965529 2968965 Mmmm.<br />Take you to him I will.
2969032 2973662 Yes, yes, but now<br />we must eat. Come.
2973737 2975398 Good food.
2975472 2976871 Come.
2985983 2987883 Come, come.
2989219 2994054 R2... stay and watch<br />after the camp.
3007104 3009800 Oh! Where is R2<br />when I need him?
3009873 3012967 Sir, I don't know where your ship<br />learned to communicate...
3013043 3014738 but it has the most<br />peculiar dialect.
3014811 3016870 I believe, sir, it says<br />that the power coupling...
3016947 3018380 on the negative axis<br />has been polarized.
3018448 3020973 I'm afraid you'll have<br />to replace it.
3021051 3024316 Well, of course I'll<br />have to replace it.
3024388 3025912 Here!
3025989 3027752 And, Chewie...
3029459 3032087 I think we'd better replace<br />the negative power coupling.
3053183 3057142 Hey, Your Worship,<br />I'm only trying to help.
3057220 3059586 Would you please<br />stop calling me that?
3059656 3061783 Sure, Leia.
3061858 3063917 You make it<br />so difficult sometimes.
3063994 3065962 I do. I really do.
3066029 3068964 You could be a little nicer, though.
3069032 3071933 Come on, admit it.<br />Sometimes you think I'm all right.
3073503 3075937 Occasionally... maybe...
3076006 3078600 when you aren't acting<br />like a scoundrel.
3078675 3080472 Scoundrel?
3080544 3082068 Scoundrel?
3084381 3086941 I like the sound<br />of that.
3087017 3087915 Stop that.
3087984 3089747 Stop what?
3089820 3091913 Stop that.<br />My hands are dirty.
3091988 3094422 My hands are dirty, too.<br />What are you afraid of?
3094491 3095685 Afraid?
3095759 3097693 You're trembling.
3097761 3099456 I'm not trembling.
3099529 3103727 You like me because<br />I'm a scoundrel.
3103800 3105859 There aren't enough<br />scoundrels in your life.
3105936 3108461 I happen to like nice men.
3108538 3109527 I'm a nice man.
3109606 3111335 No, you're not. You're...
3113944 3115070 Sir, sir!
3115145 3117841 I've isolated<br />the reverse power flux coupling.
3120050 3121312 Thank you.
3121384 3122783 Thank you very much.
3122853 3124616 Oh, you're perfectly<br />welcome, sir.
3130693 3133992 And that was the last time<br />they appeared in any of our scopes.
3134063 3135621 Considering the amount of<br />damage we've sustained...
3135698 3136926 they must have been<br />destroyed.
3137000 3139764 No, Captain.<br />They're alive.
3139836 3141804 I want every ship<br />available...
3141871 3143463 to sweep<br />the asteroid field...
3143540 3144802 until they are found.
3148845 3150176 Lord Vader.
3150246 3152180 Yes, Admiral.<br />What is it?
3152248 3153681 The emperor<br />commands you...
3153750 3155183 to make contact<br />with him.
3155251 3157116 Move the ship out of<br />the asteroid field...
3157186 3160121 so that we can send<br />a clear transmission.
3160189 3161679 Yes, my lord.
3178041 3180635 What is thy bidding,<br />my master?
3181844 3184836 There is a great<br />disturbance in the Force.
3184914 3186779 I have felt it.
3186849 3189283 We have<br />a new enemy...
3189352 3191616 Luke Skywalker.
3191688 3193451 Yes, my master.
3193523 3195650 He could destroy us.
3195725 3197625 He's just a boy.
3197694 3200822 Obi-Wan can no longer<br />help him.
3200897 3203593 The Force<br />is strong with him.
3203666 3205725 The son of Skywalker...
3205802 3209101 must not become a Jedi.
3209172 3211265 If he could be turned...
3211341 3214139 he would become<br />a powerful ally.
3214210 3215336 Yes.
3215411 3217606 Yes.
3217680 3220843 He would be<br />a great asset.
3220917 3222680 Can it be done?
3222752 3226188 He will join us<br />or die, master.
3243840 3245205 Look,<br />I'm sure it's delicious.
3245274 3248209 I just don't understand<br />why we can't see Yoda now.
3248277 3249209 Patience!
3249278 3250711 For the Jedi...
3250780 3252611 it is time<br />to eat as well.
3252682 3254616 Hmm? Heh heh.
3254684 3257881 Eat, eat.
3257954 3259046 Hot!
3266696 3268755 Good food!<br />Mmm, good, hmm?
3268831 3271925 How far away is Yoda?<br />Will it take us long to get there?
3272001 3273730 Not far.<br />Yoda not far.
3273803 3277034 Patience. Soon you<br />will be with him.
3279475 3281102 Root leaf.
3281177 3282576 I cook.
3282645 3287082 Why wish you<br />become Jedi? Hmm? Hmm?
3287150 3289311 Mostly because of<br />my father, I guess.
3289385 3290647 Ah, father.
3290720 3293154 Powerful Jedi was he.
3293222 3295156 Hee hee.<br />Mmm, powerful Jedi.
3295224 3296919 Oh, come on.
3296993 3298483 How could you<br />know my father?
3298561 3300324 You don't<br />even know who I am.
3300396 3302330 I don't even know<br />what I'm doing here.
3302398 3304195 We're wasting our time!
3305268 3307133 I cannot teach him.
3307203 3309637 The boy<br />has no patience.
3309706 3312368 <i>He will learn patience.
3312442 3313534 Hmm...
3317113 3319604 Much anger in him...
3319682 3321616 like his father.
3321684 3325450 <i>Was I any different</i><br /><i>when you taught me?
3326823 3328620 No.
3328691 3330591 He is not ready.
3330660 3331957 Yoda.
3334163 3335562 I am ready.
3335631 3337929 Ben...<br />I can be a Jedi.
3338000 3339968 Ben, tell him I'm...
3340036 3341469 Ready, are you?
3341537 3343869 What know you ready?
3343940 3347341 For 800 years<br />have I trained Jedi.
3347410 3349970 My own counsel will I keep...
3350046 3352913 on who is to be trained.
3352982 3357646 A Jedi must have<br />the deepest commitment, hmm?
3357720 3359620 The most serious mind.
3361357 3365453 This one a long time<br />have I watched.
3365528 3368554 All his life<br />has he looked away...
3368631 3371725 to the future,<br />to the horizon.
3371801 3375396 Never his mind<br />on where he was...
3375471 3376597 hmm?
3376672 3378640 What he was doing.
3378708 3380300 Hmph!
3380376 3381468 Adventure.
3381544 3382636 Ha!
3382712 3384145 Excitement. Ha!
3384213 3386841 A Jedi craves<br />not these things.
3386916 3389612 You are reckless!
3389685 3392677 <i>So was I,</i><br /><i>if you remember.
3392755 3395690 He is too old.
3395758 3398488 Yes, too old to<br />begin the training.
3398561 3401086 But I've learned so much.
3404700 3405962 Ahh...
3407503 3410438 Will he finish<br />what he begins?
3410506 3412167 I won't fail you.
3413676 3415371 I'm not afraid.
3416913 3418141 Oh...
3419715 3421649 You will be.
3423052 3425145 You will be.
3466643 3467940 Aah!
3468011 3469979 Sir, if I may venture<br />an opinion...
3470046 3472037 I'm not really interested<br />in your opinion.
3472115 3473446 There's something<br />out there.
3473516 3474710 Where?
3474784 3475773 Outside in the cave.
3477454 3478853 There it is.<br />Listen. Listen!
3478922 3479946 I'm going out there.
3480023 3481012 Are you crazy?
3481091 3482490 I just got this bucket<br />back together.
3482559 3484686 I'm not going to let<br />something tear it apart.
3484761 3486490 Then I'm going<br />with you.
3486563 3488190 I think it might<br />be better...
3488264 3490391 if I stay behind and guard the ship.
3490467 3491399 Oh, no.
3505348 3508613 This ground<br />sure feels strange.
3508685 3511176 It doesn't<br />feel like rock.
3514591 3518118 There's an awful lot<br />of moisture in here.
3518194 3520025 I don't know.
3520096 3523122 I have a bad feeling<br />about this.
3523199 3524359 Yeah.
3526002 3526969 Watch out!
3528171 3529468 It's all right.
3529539 3530597 It's all right.
3530673 3532607 Yeah, that's what<br />I thought... mynock.
3532675 3534472 Chewie, check the rest<br />of the ship...
3534544 3536910 and make sure there are<br />no more attached...
3536980 3539244 chewing<br />on the power cables.
3539315 3540612 Mynocks.
3540683 3542947 Go on inside. We'll clean them off<br />if there are any more.
3547423 3549186 Han!
3550760 3553490 Aagghh! Go away, go away,<br />beastly thing!
3553563 3554587 Shoo! Shoo!
3561437 3563371 Wait a minute...
3585128 3586459 Let's get out of here!
3586529 3588724 The Empire is still out there!<br />I don't think...
3588798 3591028 No time to discuss this<br />in committee!
3591100 3593125 I'm not a committee!
3599108 3602043 You can't make the jump to light speed<br />in this asteroid field.
3602111 3604807 Sit down, sweetheart!<br />We're taking off!
3608585 3609574 Look!
3609652 3610983 I see it.<br />I see it.
3611054 3612043 We're doomed!
3612121 3613486 The cave is collapsing.
3613556 3615490 - This is no cave.<br />- What?
3648324 3649348 Run!
3649425 3653293 Yes! A Jedis strength<br />flows from the Force.
3653363 3656025 But beware<br />of the dark side.
3656099 3657794 Anger, fear,<br />aggression...
3657867 3660961 The dark side of<br />the Force are they...
3661037 3664029 easily they flow,<br />quick to join you in a fight.
3664107 3666871 If once you start down<br />the dark path...
3666943 3669036 forever will it dominate<br />your destiny.
3669112 3670545 Consume you it will...
3670613 3672444 as it did Obi-Wan's<br />apprentice.
3672515 3673948 Vader.
3674017 3676247 Is the dark side<br />stronger?
3676319 3677786 No, no.
3677854 3679253 No.
3679322 3681756 Quicker, easier,<br />more seductive.
3681824 3684725 How do I know the good side<br />from the bad?
3684794 3688059 You will know<br />when you are calm...
3688131 3690065 at peace...
3690133 3691794 passive.
3691868 3695133 A Jedi<br />uses the Force...
3695204 3696933 for knowledge<br />and defense...
3697006 3699167 never for attack.
3699242 3700266 But tell me why<br />I can't...
3700343 3702470 No, no.<br />There is no why.
3702545 3705309 Nothing more will I<br />teach you today.
3705381 3707906 Clear your mind<br />of questions.
3707984 3711750 Hmm...
3711821 3713448 Mmm...
3730239 3732400 There's something<br />not right here.
3736045 3738275 I feel cold...
3738348 3739508 death.
3739582 3741675 That place...
3741751 3744982 is strong with<br />the dark side of the Force.
3745054 3747352 A domain of evil it is.
3749325 3750724 In you must go.
3750793 3753159 What's in there?
3755131 3757156 Only what<br />you take with you.
3761537 3763198 Your weapons...
3763272 3765536 you will not need them.
3913990 3915048 Hmph...
3925101 3926033 Bounty hunters.
3926102 3927535 We don't need<br />their scum.
3927603 3929036 Yes, sir.
3929105 3931130 Those rebels<br />won't escape us.
3936779 3939247 Sir, we have<br />a priority signal...
3939315 3941180 from the<br />Stardestroyer <i>Avenger.
3941250 3944242 There will be<br />a substantial reward...
3944320 3946254 for the one<br />who finds...
3946322 3948256 the <i>Millennium Falcon.
3948324 3950884 You are free to use<br />any methods necessary...
3950960 3953155 but I want them alive.
3953229 3955697 No disintegrations.
3955765 3957665 As you wish.
3957733 3958995 Lord Vader.
3959068 3961764 My lord,<br />we have them.
3966275 3968072 Oh, thank goodness<br />we're coming out of...
3968144 3969406 the asteroid field.
3973082 3974947 Let's get out of here.
3975017 3976507 Ready for light speed?
3976586 3977848 1...
3977920 3979581 2...
3979655 3980849 3!
3986896 3988227 It's not fair.
3988297 3989730 Gahhh!
3989799 3991858 Transfer circuits<br />aren't working.
3991934 3994095 It's not my fault!
3994170 3995194 No light speed?
3995271 3997136 It's not my fault.
4001877 4003936 Sir, we've just lost<br />the main rear deflector shield.
4004013 4006311 One more direct hit<br />on the back quarter and we're done for.
4006382 4008145 Turn her around.
4008217 4010481 I'm going to put all power<br />in the front shield.
4010553 4011884 You're going to<br />attack them?
4011954 4015082 Sir, the odds of surviving<br />a direct assault on an imperial...
4015157 4017125 - Shut up!<br />- Gaahh!
4023566 4025591 They're moving to<br />attack position.
4027737 4028897 Shields up.
4033576 4035009 Track them.
4035077 4037170 They may come around<br />for another pass.
4037246 4039680 Captain Needa, the ship<br />no longer appears on our scopes.
4039749 4041683 They can't<br />have disappeared.
4041751 4044311 No ship that small<br />has a cloaking device.
4044387 4046287 Well, there's no trace<br />of them, sir.
4046355 4048289 Captain, Lord Vader demands<br />an update on the pursuit.
4050793 4052522 Get a shuttle ready.
4052595 4055223 I shall assume full responsibility<br />for losing them...
4055298 4056959 and apologize<br />to Lord Vader.
4057033 4058967 Meanwhile, continue<br />to scan the area.
4059035 4060593 Yes, Captain Needa.
4065274 4067674 Use the Force.
4067743 4068675 Yes.
4074250 4075979 Now, the stone...
4079522 4081581 Feel it.
4093536 4095367 Concentrate!
4109585 4113077 Oh, no. We'll never<br />get it out now.
4113155 4114918 So certain are you.
4118594 4121688 Always with you<br />it cannot be done.
4123466 4125434 Hear you nothing<br />that I say?
4125501 4128026 Master, moving stones around<br />is one thing.
4128104 4129594 This is totally<br />different.
4129672 4131333 No! No different!
4131407 4133807 Only different<br />in your mind.
4133876 4137539 You must unlearn<br />what you have learned.
4137613 4140173 All right.<br />I'll give it a try.
4140249 4142012 No! Try not.
4142084 4144348 Do.
4144420 4145751 Or do not.
4145821 4147789 There is no try.
4195337 4198204 I can't.<br />It's too big.
4198274 4201209 Size matters not.<br />Look at me.
4201277 4204644 Judge me by my size,<br />do you?
4204713 4205771 Hmm?
4205848 4207281 Hmph!
4207349 4209613 And well you should not...
4209685 4212848 for my ally is the Force.
4212922 4215891 And a powerful<br />ally it is.
4215958 4218188 Life creates it...
4218260 4219887 makes it grow.
4221130 4224896 Its energy surrounds us...
4224967 4226901 and binds us.
4226969 4229130 Luminous beings are we...
4229205 4231173 not this crude matter.
4231240 4235336 You must feel<br />the Force around you...
4235411 4238812 Here,<br />between you, me...
4238881 4240075 the tree...
4240149 4241946 the rock...
4242017 4242779 everywhere!
4242852 4244149 Yes...
4245754 4249622 even between the land<br />and the ship.
4253662 4255653 You want the impossible.
4350192 4352092 Mm...
4363205 4364137 I don't...
4364206 4366333 I don't believe it.
4367476 4370377 That is why you fail.
4389398 4393528 Apology accepted,<br />Captain Needa.
4401176 4404771 Lord Vader, our ships have completed<br />their scan of the area and found nothing.
4404847 4406542 If the <i>Millennium Falcon</i><br />went into light speed...
4406615 4409209 it'll be on the other side<br />of the galaxy by now.
4409284 4410216 Alert all commands.
4410285 4412219 Calculate every<br />possible destination...
4412287 4415552 along their last known<br />trajectory.
4415624 4416989 Yes, my lord.<br />We'll find them.
4417059 4419050 Don't fail me again...
4420129 4421255 Admiral.
4422765 4424699 Alert all commands.
4424767 4426667 Deploy the fleet.
4441617 4443949 Captain Solo,<br />this time you've gone too far.
4444019 4445418 Gahhh!
4445487 4448081 I will not be quiet.<br />Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
4448157 4450091 The fleet's beginning<br />to break up.
4450159 4451888 Go back and stand by<br />the manual release...
4451960 4454292 for the landing claw.
4456632 4458623 I really don't see<br />how that's going to help.
4458701 4461966 Surrender is a perfectly acceptable<br />alternative in extreme circumstances.
4462037 4463971 The Empire<br />may be gracious enough...
4464039 4464971 Thank you.
4465040 4466735 What's your next move?
4466809 4468276 If they follow standard<br />imperial procedure...
4468343 4469776 they'll dump their garbage...
4469845 4471312 before they go to<br />light speed...
4471380 4472813 and then we just<br />float away.
4472881 4474473 With the rest<br />of the garbage.
4474550 4475949 Then what?
4476018 4478782 Then we got to find a safe port<br />somewhere around here.
4478854 4479786 Any ideas?
4479855 4481322 Where are we?
4481390 4482823 The Anoat system.
4482891 4484825 There's not<br />much there.
4484893 4488795 No. Well, wait.<br />This is interesting.
4488864 4489990 Lando.
4490065 4491498 Lando system?
4491567 4494502 Lando's not a system.<br />He's a man. Lando Calrissian.
4494570 4497004 He's a cardplayer,<br />gambler, scoundrel.
4497072 4498403 You'd like him.
4498474 4499839 Thanks.
4499908 4503639 Bespin. It's pretty far,<br />but I think we can make it.
4503712 4505680 A mining colony?
4505748 4508182 Yeah, a tibanna<br />gas mine.
4508250 4511185 Lando conned<br />somebody out of it.
4511253 4514086 We go back a long way,<br />Lando and me.
4514156 4516124 Can you trust him?
4516191 4519456 No. But he's got no<br />love for the Empire...
4519528 4520961 I can tell you that.
4521029 4523554 Here we go, Chewie.<br />Stand by.
4523632 4524656 Detach.
4531373 4533432 You do have your moments.
4533509 4535443 Not many of them...
4535511 4537911 but you do have them.
4564840 4567400 Concentrate.
4567476 4570639 Feel the Force flow.
4570712 4572907 Yes.
4579855 4581447 Good.
4581523 4582922 Calm.
4582991 4585186 Yes.
4585260 4588661 Through the Force,<br />things you will see.
4588730 4592291 Other places.<br />The future. The past.
4592367 4594835 Old friends long gone.
4597206 4598503 Han?
4598574 4600872 Leia!
4603545 4605342 Hmm...
4605414 4606813 Control, control.
4606882 4608816 You must learn control!
4610786 4615120 I saw... I saw a city<br />in the clouds.
4615190 4616680 Hmm...
4616758 4619352 Friends you have there.
4619428 4621453 They were in pain.
4621530 4624897 It is the future you see.
4624967 4626298 Future?
4634810 4636710 Will they die?
4639615 4641310 Difficult to see.
4641383 4644648 Always in motion<br />is the future.
4645721 4648554 I've got to go to them.
4650058 4652993 Decide you must<br />how to serve them best.
4653061 4655757 If you leave now,<br />help them you could...
4655831 4657822 but you would destroy all...
4657900 4661233 for which they have<br />fought and suffered.
4674416 4677874 No, I don't have<br />a landing permit.
4677953 4681855 I'm trying to reach<br />Lando Calrissian.
4681924 4684085 Wait a minute!<br />Let me explain!
4684159 4685626 <i>You will not deviate</i><br /><i>from your present course.
4685694 4687252 Rather touchy,<br />aren't they?
4687329 4689024 I thought<br />you knew this person.
4689097 4691031 Gaah!
4691099 4692964 That was<br />a long time ago.
4693035 4694730 I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
4702277 4706941 <i>Permission granted to land</i><br /><i>on Platform 3-2-7.
4707015 4708505 Thank you.
4708583 4710517 Nothing<br />to worry about.
4710585 4712246 We go way back,<br />Lando and me.
4712321 4714050 Who's worried?
4747222 4749816 Oh. No one to meet us.
4749891 4751859 I don't like this.
4751927 4754361 Well, what<br />would you like?
4754429 4756863 They <i>did</i> let us land.
4756932 4758866 Look, don't worry.<br />Everything's going to be fine.
4758934 4760333 Trust me.
4764940 4767306 See? My friend.
4771546 4774140 Keep your eyes<br />open, huh?
4774216 4776150 Gahhh!
4776218 4777708 Hey!
4777786 4779515 Why, you slimy...
4779588 4782921 double-crossing,<br />no-good swindler.
4782991 4785516 You've got a lot of guts coming here...
4785594 4787255 after what you pulled.
4795137 4797662 Ha ha ha ha ha<br />ha ha ha ha!
4797739 4801231 How you doin', you old pirate?<br />So good to see you!
4801309 4804403 Well, he seems<br />very friendly.
4804479 4805468 Yes.
4805547 4807606 Very friendly.
4807682 4809115 What are you doing here?
4809184 4811516 Ah, repairs.<br />I thought you could help me out.
4811586 4813645 What have you done<br />to my ship?
4813722 4814654 Your ship?
4814723 4815712 Hey, remember...
4815791 4817918 you lost her to me<br />fair and square.
4817993 4820188 And how you doin',<br />Chewbacca?
4820262 4821422 Gahh!
4821496 4822929 You still hanging around<br />with this loser?
4822998 4825694 Gahhh!
4825767 4828133 Hello.<br />What have we here?
4828203 4829534 Welcome,<br />I'm Lando Calrissian.
4829604 4832437 I'm the administrator<br />of this facility.
4832507 4834407 And who might you be?
4834476 4835636 Leia.
4835710 4837302 Welcome, Leia.
4840415 4843851 All right, all right,<br />you old smoothie.
4843919 4847355 Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,<br />human-cyborg relations.
4847422 4848912 My facilities<br />are at your...
4848990 4850321 Well, really!
4850392 4852292 What's wrong<br />with the <i>Falcon?
4852360 4853622 Hyperdrive.
4853695 4855629 I'll get my people<br />to work on her.
4855697 4857392 That ship saved my life<br />quite a few times.
4857466 4860401 She's the fastest<br />hunk of junk in the galaxy.
4860469 4863632 How's the gas mine?<br />Still paying off for you?
4863705 4865104 Not as well as I'd like.
4865173 4867368 We're a small outpost<br />and not very self-sufficient.
4867442 4868875 I've had supply problems<br />of every kind.
4868944 4870377 I've had labor difficulties.
4870445 4872106 Ha ha ha!
4872180 4873772 What's so funny?
4873849 4875373 You. Listen to you.
4875450 4877509 You sound like<br />a businessman...
4877586 4879019 a responsible leader.
4879087 4881317 Who'd have<br />thought that, huh?
4881389 4883983 Seeing you brings back<br />a few things.
4884059 4885151 Yeah.
4885227 4887024 Yeah, I'm responsible<br />these days.
4887095 4889120 It's the price you pay...
4889197 4891131 for being successful.
4893401 4895892 Ooh. Nice to see<br />a familiar face.
4895971 4897404 <i>E chu ta!
4897472 4898905 How rude!
4900475 4902409 That sounds like<br />an R2 unit in there.
4902477 4903967 I wonder if... Hello?
4904045 4905637 Hello?
4905714 4907147 How interesting.
4907215 4908842 Who are you?
4908917 4910350 Oh, my! I...<br />I'm terribly sorry.
4910418 4911942 I didn't mean<br />to intrude.
4912020 4913146 No, please don't get up.
4919594 4921061 Gahhh.
4931573 4934201 Luke, you must complete<br />the training.
4934276 4935971 I can't keep the vision<br />out of my head.
4936044 4938069 They're my friends.<br />I got to help them.
4938146 4940341 You must not go.
4940415 4943543 But Han and Leia will die<br />if I don't.
4943618 4945210 <i>You don't know that.
4945287 4948188 <i>Even Yoda cannot</i><br /><i>see their fate.
4948256 4950417 But I can help them.
4950492 4952016 I feel the Force.
4952093 4953560 <i>But you cannot</i><br /><i>control it.
4953628 4956188 <i>This is a dangerous</i><br /><i>time for you...
4956264 4960064 <i>when you will be tempted</i><br /><i>by the dark side of the Force.
4960135 4963400 Yes! Yes!<br />To Obi-Wan you listen.
4963471 4966565 The cave.<br />Remember your failure at the cave.
4966641 4969940 But I've learned<br />so much since then.
4970011 4973447 Master Yoda, I promise to return<br />and to finish what I've begun.
4973515 4974846 You have my word.
4974916 4976349 <i>It is you</i><br /><i>and your abilities...
4976418 4977715 <i>the emperor wants.
4977786 4981688 <i>That is why your friends</i><br /><i>are made to suffer.
4981756 4983724 That's why<br />I have to go.
4983792 4987125 <i>Luke, I don't want</i><br /><i>to lose you to the emperor...
4987195 4989186 <i>the way I lost Vader.
4989264 4990788 You won't.
4990865 4992856 Stopped they must be.
4992934 4995266 On this all depends.
4995337 4997703 Only a fully trained<br />Jedi knight...
4997772 4999603 with the Force<br />as his ally...
4999674 5002302 will conquer Vader<br />and his emperor.
5002377 5004538 If you end<br />your training now...
5004613 5008947 if you choose the quick and easy path,<br />as Vader did...
5009017 5011713 you will become<br />an agent of evil.
5011786 5012775 <i>Patience.
5012854 5015084 And sacrifice<br />Han and Leia?
5015156 5019252 If you honor what they fight for... yes.
5019327 5020988 <i>If you choose to face Vader...
5021062 5022461 <i>you will do it alone.
5022530 5024589 <i>I cannot interfere.
5025834 5027893 I understand.
5032440 5033702 R2.
5035277 5037177 Fire up the converters.
5039347 5040405 <i>Luke!
5040482 5043508 <i>Don't give in to hate.
5043585 5046418 <i>That leads to the dark side.
5046488 5047921 Strong is Vader.
5047989 5050856 Mind what you have learned.<br />Save you it can.
5050925 5052415 I will.
5052494 5054257 And I'll return.
5054329 5055762 I promise.
5062504 5064472 Told you, I did.
5064539 5066268 Reckless is he.
5066341 5067433 Now...
5067509 5069306 matters are worse.
5069377 5072312 <i>That boy</i><br /><i>is our last hope.
5072380 5074439 No, there is another.
5098340 5099705 The ship's almost finished.
5099774 5102038 Two or three more things<br />and we're in great shape.
5102110 5103737 The sooner the better.<br />Something is wrong here.
5103812 5106372 No one has seen or knows<br />anything about 3PO.
5106448 5108746 He's been gone too long<br />to have gotten lost.
5108817 5111251 Relax.<br />I'll talk to Lando...
5111319 5113753 and see what<br />I can find out.
5113822 5115756 I don't trust Lando.
5115824 5118258 Well, I don't<br />trust him either.
5118326 5120851 But he is my friend.<br />Besides...
5120929 5122863 we'll soon be gone.
5122931 5126264 Then you're as good as gone,<br />aren't you?
5159501 5160968 Gaahh!
5161035 5162127 What happened?
5162203 5163761 Gahhh gahhh.
5163838 5165203 Where?
5165273 5166604 Gahhh!
5166674 5168574 Found him<br />in a junk pile?
5168643 5171407 Oh, what a mess.<br />Chewie, you think you can repair him?
5171479 5173447 Gahhh!
5173515 5175210 Lando's got people<br />that can fix him.
5175283 5176773 No, thanks.
5176851 5180514 I'm sorry, am I<br />interrupting anything?
5180588 5182579 Not really.
5186027 5188120 You look<br />absolutely beautiful.
5188196 5191563 You truly belong here<br />with us among the clouds.
5191633 5193100 Thank you.
5193168 5196103 Would you join me<br />for a little refreshment?
5196171 5197763 Everyone's invited,<br />of course.
5199174 5201074 Having trouble<br />with your droid?
5201142 5202609 No, no problem.
5202677 5203701 Why?
5211920 5214218 You see, since we're<br />a small operation...
5214289 5216314 we don't fall into...
5216391 5218757 the jurisdiction<br />of the Empire.
5218827 5221762 So you're part of<br />the Mining Guild, then?
5221830 5223730 No, not actually. Our operation<br />is small enough not to be noticed.
5223798 5225766 Which is advantageous<br />for everybody...
5225834 5228234 since our customers<br />are anxious to avoid...
5228303 5230464 attracting attention<br />to themselves.
5230538 5233006 Aren't you afraid<br />the Empire's going to find out...
5233074 5234939 about this little operation,<br />shut you down?
5235009 5237443 It's always been a danger that looms<br />like a shadow over everything we've built.
5237512 5239912 But things have developed<br />that'll ensure security.
5239981 5244850 I've just made a deal that will<br />keep the Empire out of here forever.
5253828 5256661 We would be honored<br />if you would join us.
5262103 5263536 I had no choice.
5263605 5265937 They arrived<br />right before you did.
5266007 5267497 I'm sorry.
5271713 5273374 I'm sorry, too.
5275617 5277448 Gahhh.
5288863 5290888 No, 3PO's with them.
5290965 5293126 Just hang on.<br />We're almost there.
5300875 5303309 Gahhh!
5303378 5306836 Gahhh!
5349891 5351791 Oh ah ooh ah.
5351859 5354293 Im trbly srry.
5354362 5356796 I dndt mn to<br />intrddd.
5360902 5363302 No! Secret.<br />Stormtroopers?
5363371 5364963 Here?<br />We're in danger!
5365039 5367064 I must<br />tell the others.
5367141 5369132 Oh, no,<br />I've been shot!
5387895 5389624 Aaah!
5389697 5390789 Aaah!
5390865 5394858 Aaaaahhh!
5396371 5397804 Lord Vader.
5397872 5401308 You may take Captain Solo<br />to Jabba the Hutt...
5401376 5403276 after I have Skywalker.
5403344 5405244 He's no good to me dead.
5405313 5408282 He will not be<br />permanently damaged.
5408349 5410476 Aaaahhh!
5410551 5413987 Lord Vader, what about Leia<br />and the Wookiee?
5414055 5416455 They must never again<br />leave this city.
5416524 5418082 That was never a condition<br />of our agreement...
5418159 5419786 nor was giving Han<br />to this bounty hunter.
5419861 5425060 Perhaps you think you're<br />being treated unfairly?
5425133 5426065 No.
5426134 5427601 Good. It would be<br />unfortunate...
5427669 5431264 if I had to leave<br />a garrison here.
5431339 5435708 This deal is getting worse all the time.
5436911 5439846 Oh, yes, that's very good.<br />I like that.
5439914 5441108 Oh!
5441182 5443810 Something's not right<br />because now I can't see.
5443885 5448015 Oh, oh, oh,<br />that's much better.
5448089 5449522 Wait! Wait!
5449590 5451524 Oh, my!<br />What have you done?
5451592 5453526 I'm backwards...
5453594 5455528 you flea-bitten<br />furball!
5455596 5457530 Only an overgrown<br />mophead like you...
5457598 5459259 would be<br />stupid enough...
5472780 5474372 I feel terrible.
5474449 5475882 Gahhh.
5489497 5491897 Why are they<br />doing this?
5495002 5498403 They never even asked me<br />any questions.
5501809 5503401 Lando.
5506147 5507205 Grrr!
5507281 5508441 Get out of here, Lando.
5508516 5510416 Shut up and listen!
5510485 5512715 Vader's agreed<br />to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
5512787 5514721 They'll have to stay here,<br />but at least they'll be safe.
5514789 5515881 What about Han?
5515957 5516946 Vader's given him<br />to the bounty hunter.
5517024 5518582 Vader wants us<br />all dead.
5518659 5519717 He doesn't want you at all.
5519794 5521591 He's after somebody<br />called Skywalker.
5521662 5523596 - Luke.<br />- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
5523664 5525689 And we're the bait!
5525767 5527632 He's on his way.
5527702 5530796 You fixed us all<br />real good, didn't you?
5530872 5532100 My friend.
5534375 5535535 Stop!
5537545 5539103 I've done all I can.
5539180 5540613 I'm sorry<br />I couldn't do better...
5540681 5542308 but I've got<br />my own problems.
5542383 5543782 Yeah.
5543851 5545716 You're a real hero.
5556063 5558657 You certainly have<br />a way with people.
5562403 5564030 Ah... Ah...
5573014 5575175 This facility is crude...
5575249 5578218 but it should be adequate<br />to freeze Skywalker...
5578286 5580720 for his journey to the emperor.
5580788 5583655 Lord Vader, ship approaching,<br />X-wing class.
5583724 5586056 Good.<br />Monitor Skywalker...
5586127 5588152 and allow him<br />to land.
5588229 5591630 Lord Vader, we only use this facility<br />for carbon freezing.
5591699 5594065 You put him in there,<br />it might kill him.
5594135 5595568 I do not want...
5595636 5597069 the emperor's prize<br />damaged.
5597138 5599629 We will test it<br />on Captain Solo.
5622196 5625029 If only you'd<br />attached my legs...
5625099 5627067 I wouldn't be<br />in this ridiculous position.
5627134 5628567 Now remember,<br />Chewbacca...
5628636 5630570 you have a responsibility for me...
5630638 5632503 so don't do anything foolish.
5645253 5647050 What's going on...
5647121 5648645 buddy?
5648723 5651692 You're being put<br />into carbon freeze.
5651759 5655251 What if he doesn't survive?<br />He's worth a lot to me.
5655329 5656762 The Empire<br />will compensate you...
5656831 5657923 if he dies.
5657999 5659933 Put him in.
5660001 5661093 Rrrah!
5661168 5663602 Rrrah! Rrrah!
5663671 5665605 Stop, Chewie,<br />stop, stop!
5665673 5669200 Yes, stop, please!<br />I'm not ready to die!
5669277 5671768 Hey! Hey! Listen<br />to me, Chewie.
5671846 5673905 This won't help me.
5673981 5675243 Hey, save your strength.
5675316 5677944 There will be<br />another time.
5678019 5680112 The princess...
5680187 5682018 You have to<br />take care of her.
5684191 5686523 Do you hear me?<br />Huh?
5686594 5687891 Gahhh...
5700107 5701301 I love you.
5701375 5703104 I know.
5724131 5725598 Gahhh!
5732239 5734400 What's going on?<br />Turn around!
5734475 5735908 Chewbacca,<br />I can't see.
5750091 5752321 Gahhh.
5793634 5797070 Oh, they've encased him<br />in carbonite.
5797138 5798833 He should be quite<br />well-protected...
5798906 5800874 if he survived the freezing process,<br />that is.
5800941 5803842 Well, Calrissian,<br />did he survive?
5803911 5805776 Yes, he's alive.
5805846 5808007 And in perfect hibernation.
5808082 5811074 He's all yours,<br />bounty hunter.
5811152 5813677 Reset the chamber<br />for Skywalker.
5816057 5817922 Skywalker has<br />just landed, lord.
5817992 5821928 Good. See to it<br />that he finds his way in here.
5826133 5830593 Calrissian, take the princess<br />and the Wookiee to my ship.
5830671 5832866 You said they'd be left in the city<br />under my supervision.
5832940 5835033 I am altering the deal.
5835109 5837873 Pray I don't<br />alter it any further.
5933741 5935003 Gahhh!
5935075 5937669 Luke! Luke, don't,<br />it's a trap!
5939113 5940273 It's a trap!
5985492 5989053 The Force is with you,<br />young Skywalker.
5990531 5993523 But you are not<br />a Jedi yet.
6054828 6056261 Well done.
6058365 6060799 Hold them<br />in the security tower.
6060868 6063029 And keep it quiet. Move.
6067975 6070239 What do you think<br />you're doing?
6070311 6071300 We're getting<br />out of here.
6071378 6073175 I knew all along.<br />It had to be a mistake.
6073247 6076148 Do you think that after what you did<br />to Han, we're going to trust you?
6076216 6077012 Grrr!
6077084 6078779 I had no choice.
6078852 6080444 What are you doing?<br />Trust him! Trust him!
6080521 6083581 We understand, don't we,<br />Chewie? He had no choice.
6083657 6085249 I'm just<br />trying to help.
6085326 6087658 We don't need<br />any of your help.
6087728 6089127 Haaa...
6089196 6089992 Grrr!
6090064 6092328 Ha... Ha...
6092399 6093457 What?
6093534 6094626 Han...
6094702 6095862 It sounds like Han.
6095936 6097494 There's still<br />a chance...
6097571 6099334 to save Han...
6099406 6101772 at the east...
6101842 6103537 platform.
6103610 6104634 Chewie.
6107247 6109875 I'm terribly sorry<br />about all this.
6109950 6111781 After all,<br />he's only a Wookiee.
6111852 6115481 Put Captain Solo<br />in the cargo hold.
6130571 6133005 R2, R2, where have you been?
6133073 6134870 Wait. Turn around, you woolly...
6134942 6138844 Hurry! Hurry! We're trying to save Han<br />from the bounty hunter.
6140314 6143977 Well, at least you're still in one piece.
6144051 6146485 Look what's happened to me.
6158399 6161027 Oh, no! Chewie,<br />they're behind you!
6173947 6176347 You have learned<br />much, young one.
6176417 6178578 You'll find<br />I'm full of surprises.
6189596 6193259 Your destiny lies<br />with me, Skywalker.
6193333 6196666 Obi-Wan knew this<br />to be true.
6196737 6197567 No.
6201975 6202873 Aaah!
6204645 6206044 All too easy.
6211285 6213753 Perhaps you're<br />not as strong...
6213821 6215721 as the emperor thought.
6216857 6218552 Impressive.
6220461 6221928 Most impressive.
6224798 6226390 Aaah!
6229369 6231360 Obi-Wan has<br />taught you well.
6231438 6233838 You have<br />controlled your fear.
6235309 6236799 Now...
6236877 6239471 release your anger.
6239546 6242640 Only your hatred<br />can destroy me.
6253160 6254457 Ohh!
6372853 6375117 The security code<br />has been changed.
6375188 6377122 R2, you can tell<br />the computer...
6377190 6378521 to override<br />the security systems.
6378592 6381026 R2, hurry!
6382062 6383620 Attention. This is<br />Lando Calrissian.
6383697 6385562 The Empire has taken<br />control of the city.
6385632 6389193 I advise everyone to leave<br />before more imperial troops arrive.
6394040 6395337 This way.
6395408 6397842 Well, don't blame me.<br />I'm an interpreter.
6397911 6402075 I'm not supposed to know a power socket<br />from a computer terminal.
6422002 6423469 Ah! We're not interested...
6423536 6425595 in the <i>Millennium</i><br /><i>Falcon's</i> hyperdrive.
6425672 6427435 It's fixed!
6429242 6432075 Just open the door,<br />you stupid lump!
6440787 6443312 I never doubted you<br />for a second.
6443390 6444414 Wonderful!
6467247 6469340 Ouch! Oh! That hurts!
6469416 6471646 Bend down,<br />you thoughtless... Ow!
6476122 6477987 Leia!
6478725 6480158 Go!
6484898 6488834 I thought that hairy beast<br />would be the end of me.
6489903 6491370 Of course<br />I've looked better.
6544991 6546515 You are beaten.
6546593 6548720 It is useless to resist.
6548795 6550763 Don't let yourself<br />be destroyed...
6550830 6552354 as Obi-Wan did.
6558038 6559938 Uh!
6563009 6565273 Aah!
6566946 6569779 There is no escape.
6569849 6572784 Don't make me destroy you.
6574788 6575812 Luke...
6575889 6579325 you do not yet realize<br />your importance.
6579392 6582327 You have only begun<br />to discover your power.
6582395 6583987 Join me...
6584064 6586794 and I will complete<br />your training.
6586866 6589164 With our combined strength...
6589235 6592170 we can end<br />this destructive conflict...
6592238 6594832 and bring order<br />to the galaxy.
6594908 6596398 I'll never join you!
6596476 6599309 If you only knew<br />the power...
6599379 6601347 of the dark side.
6601414 6603678 Obi-Wan never told you...
6603750 6605684 what happened<br />to your father.
6605752 6607481 He told me enough.
6610056 6611956 He told me<br />you killed him.
6612025 6613356 No.
6613426 6615826 <i>I</i> am your father.
6619933 6622026 No.
6622102 6623626 No.
6623703 6626968 That's not true.
6627040 6628803 That's impossible!
6628875 6632174 Search your feelings.<br />You know it to be true.
6633379 6636041 No!
6636116 6639449 No!
6639519 6640884 Luke.
6640954 6643149 You can destroy<br />the emperor.
6643223 6645157 He has foreseen this.
6645225 6648058 It is your destiny.
6648128 6652656 Join me, and together<br />we can rule the galaxy...
6652732 6654393 as father and son.
6664978 6666673 Come with me.
6666746 6669715 It is the only way.
6735582 6737846 Ben.
6737917 6740078 Ben, please.
6749028 6750518 Ben.
6755702 6757067 Leia.
6767180 6769171 Hear me.
6770783 6772114 Leia.
6772185 6773709 Luke.
6775855 6777789 We've got to go back.
6777857 6779825 - What?<br />- I know where Luke is.
6779892 6781086 What about<br />those fighters?
6781160 6783253 Chewie, just do it.
6783329 6784796 But what about Vader?
6784864 6786297 All right, all right!
6793906 6795897 Bring my shuttle.
6805551 6808452 Look, someone's up there.
6809889 6811015 It's Luke.
6811090 6812614 Chewie, slow down.
6812692 6814626 Slow down.<br />We'll get under him.
6814694 6817026 Lando,<br />open the top hatch.
6827573 6828767 O.K.
6828841 6829967 Easy, Chewie.
6830043 6831135 Gahrrr.
6851698 6852665 Lando?
6852732 6853858 <i>OK, let's go.
6871084 6873314 Oh, Leia.
6873386 6875354 All right, Chewie,<br />let's go.
6889936 6891233 I'll be back.
6897844 6899277 Stardestroyer.
6904484 6906884 All right, Chewie.<br />Ready for light speed.
6906953 6909148 <i>If</i> your people fixed<br />the hyperdrive.
6909222 6911622 All the coordinates are set.<br />It's now or never.
6911691 6913886 Punch it!
6923836 6926168 They told me<br />they fixed it.
6926239 6928173 I trusted them!
6928241 6930801 It's not my fault!
6935815 6938875 They'll be in range<br />of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
6938951 6940543 Did your men deactivate...
6940620 6942713 the hyperdrive on<br />the <i>Millennium Falcon?
6942789 6943756 Yes, my lord.
6943823 6946223 Good. Prepare<br />the boarding party...
6946292 6948590 and set your weapons<br />for "stun."
6948661 6950561 Yes, my lord.<br />Lieutenant.
6950630 6951722 Yes, sir.
6953332 6956165 Noisy brute. Why don't we just<br />go into light speed?
6957737 6959637 We can't?<br />How would you know...
6959705 6960797 the hyperdrive<br />is deactivated?
6964043 6966477 The city's central<br />computer told you?
6966546 6969845 R2-D2, you know better<br />than to trust a strange computer.
6969916 6970974 Ouch!
6971050 6973280 Pay attention<br />to what you're doing!
6983663 6985358 Luke.
6985431 6987695 Father.
6987767 6991601 Son, come with me.
6993439 6994929 Ben.
6996242 6998233 Why didn't you tell me?
7003449 7005383 Chewie!
