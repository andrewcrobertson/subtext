213631 215508 Echo Three to Echo Seven.
215591 217635 Han, old buddy, do you read me?
217718 219804 <i>Loud and clear, kid. What's up?</i>
219887 222598 I finished my circle.<br />I don't pick up any life readings.
222681 225643 <i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube<br />to fill a space cruiser.</i>
225726 227561 <i>The sensors are placed. I'm going back.</i>
227645 229563 Right. I'll see you shortly.
229647 231774 There's a meteorite<br />that hit the ground near here.
231857 234110 I want to check it out. It won't take long.
234193 235319 Steady.
236654 239990 Steady, girl. What's the matter?<br />You smell something?
281073 282950 Chewie. Chewie?
288831 291167 All right. Don't lose your temper.
291250 293711 I'll come right back and give you a hand.
314231 315357 Solo.
315441 318235 No sign of life out there, General.<br />The sensors are in place.
318319 321155 - You'll know if anything comes around.<br />- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
321238 324074 No. He's checking out<br />a meteorite that hit near him.
324158 327703 With all the meteor activity, it's gonna<br />be difficult to spot approaching ships.
327786 329747 General, I gotta leave. I can't stay anymore.
329830 332625 - I'm sorry to hear that.<br />- There's a price on my head.
332708 335169 If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,<br />I'm a dead man.
335252 337129 A death mark's not an easy thing to live with.
338589 341217 You're a good fighter, Solo.<br />I hate to lose you.
341300 342760 Thank you, General.
350851 352895 Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.
353771 354897 That's right.
357691 360110 Don't get all mushy on me. So long, Princess.
363072 364323 Han.
365950 369203 - Yes, Your Highnessness.<br />- I thought you had decided to stay.
369286 372164 The bounty hunter we ran into<br />in Ord Mantell changed my mind.
372248 374541 Han, we need you.
374625 376752 - We need?<br />- Yes.
376835 379338 - What about you need?<br />- I need?
379421 381924 I don't know what you're talking about.
382007 385552 - You probably don't.<br />- What precisely am I supposed to know?
385636 389139 Come on. You want me to stay because<br />of the way you feel about me.
389223 391850 Yes. You're a great help to us.<br />You're a natural leader.
391934 394520 No. That's not it.
394603 396272 Come on.
397523 399566 - Come on.<br />- You're imagining things.
399650 401610 Am I? Then why are you following me?
401694 403946 Afraid I'd leave<br />without giving you a good-bye kiss?
404029 406657 - I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.<br />- I can arrange that.
406740 408909 You could use a good kiss!
409910 412663 Don't blame me. I didn't ask you<br />to turn on the thermal heater.
412746 416208 I merely commented that it was freezing<br />in the princess's chamber.
416292 418168 It's supposed to be freezing.
418252 420713 How we're going to dry<br />her clothes I really don't know.
420796 422047 Oh, switch off!
422131 425259 Why did you take this apart now?<br />I'm trying to get us out of here.
425342 427511 - Excuse me.<br />- Put them back together right now.
427594 429680 - Might I have a word?<br />- What do you want?
429763 432308 Princess Leia's been trying<br />to get you on the communicator.
432391 434601 I turned it off. I don't want to talk to her.
434685 437604 Princess Leia is wondering about<br />Master Luke. He hasn't come back.
437688 439982 - She doesn't know where he is.<br />- I don't know where he is.
440065 442901 - Nobody knows where he is.<br />- What do you mean, nobody knows?
442985 444320 Deck Officer.
444403 446947 - Deck Officer.<br />- Excuse me, sir. Might I...
447031 448824 Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
448907 451618 I haven't seen him. It's possible<br />he came in the south entrance.
451702 453954 It's possible? Why don't you go find out?
454038 456623 - It's getting dark out there.<br />- Yes, sir.
456707 459126 Excuse me, sir.<br />Might I inquire what's going on?
459209 461545 - Why not?<br />- Impossible man.
461628 463672 Come along, R2. Let's find Princess Leia.
463756 466884 Between ourselves, I think<br />Master Luke is in considerable danger.
476435 478645 Commander Skywalker<br />hasn't come in the south entrance.
478729 481231 - Maybe he forgot to check in.<br />- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
481315 483442 Not yet. We're having trouble<br />adapting them to the cold.
483525 486528 - We'll have to go out on tauntauns.<br />- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.
486612 488697 That's right, and my friend's out in it.
493452 495954 Your tauntaun will freeze<br />before you reach the first marker.
496038 498123 Then I'll see you in hell.
635928 637846 You must come along now, R2.
637930 640015 There's really nothing more we can do.
640098 642226 And my joints are freezing up.
643268 647231 Don't say things like that.<br />Of course we'll see Master Luke again.
647314 650108 And he'll be quite all right. You'll see.
650192 653904 Stupid little short circuit.<br />He'll be quite all right.
711420 714298 Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no...
715507 718385 Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
718468 722598 Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been<br />quite unable to pick up any signals...
722681 726101 although he admits that his own range<br />is far too weak to abandon all hope.
726184 728353 Your Highness,<br />there's nothing more we can do tonight.
728437 730814 The shield doors must be closed.
732107 734568 - Close the doors.<br />- Yes, sir.
736028 740824 R2 says the chances of survival are 725-to-1.
752377 756131 Actually, R2 has been known<br />to make mistakes...
758800 760844 from time to time.
760927 762804 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
765724 768393 Don't worry about Master Luke.<br />I'm sure he'll be all right.
768477 771355 He's quite clever, you know,<br />for a human being.
787412 789164 <i>Luke.</i>
790916 792334 Luke.
799758 801343 Ben?
801426 804096 You will go to the Dagobah system.
804179 805972 Dagobah system?
806056 809559 There you will learn from Yoda...
809643 813438 the Jedi master who instructed me.
831873 835293 Don't do this, Luke. Give me a sign here.
858984 861319 - Not much time.<br />- Ben.
867909 868994 Hang on, kid.
871079 873331 Dagobah system. Dagobah.
873415 875125 This may smell bad, kid...
876418 878420 Yoda.
878503 883008 But it'll keep you warm<br />till I get the shelter up.
883091 885177 Ben. Dagobah.
889055 891099 I thought they smelled bad...
891183 893101 on the outside.
936353 938814 Echo Base, I've got something.
938897 940857 Not much, but it could be a life-form.
945445 947739 Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
947823 949741 This is Rogue Two.
949825 952536 This is Rogue Two.
952619 955539 Captain Solo, do you copy?
961169 964673 Commander Skywalker, do you copy?
964756 966633 This is Rogue Two.
966716 969886 <i>Good morning. Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>
970762 973849 Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
973932 976560 I've found them. Repeat. I've found them.
1007173 1010010 Master Luke, sir, it's so good<br />to see you fully functional again.
1010093 1013346 - Thanks, 3PO.<br />- R2 expresses his relief also.
1013430 1016975 How ya feelin', kid?<br />You don't look so bad to me.
1017058 1019978 You look strong enough<br />to pull the ears off a gundark.
1020061 1023899 - Thanks to you.<br />- That's two you owe me, junior.
1023982 1025358 Well, Your Worship...
1025442 1028570 looks like you managed to keep me around<br />for a little while longer.
1028653 1030572 I had nothing to do with it.
1030655 1033325 General Rieekan thinks<br />it's dangerous for any ships to leave...
1033408 1035368 until we've activated the energy field.
1035452 1036745 That's a good story.
1036828 1040790 I think you just can't bear to let a<br />gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
1040874 1044252 I don't know where<br />you get your delusions, laser brain.
1047631 1049883 Laugh it up, fuzzball...
1049966 1053094 but you didn't see us alone<br />in the south passage.
1053178 1055472 She expressed her true feelings for me.
1055555 1056723 My...
1056806 1060268 Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...
1060352 1062479 scruffy-looking nerf herder!
1063688 1065649 Who's scruffy-lookin'?
1068944 1072364 I must have hit close to the mark<br />to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?
1076034 1078954 I guess you don't know<br />everything about women yet.
1085168 1087879 <i>Headquarters personnel,<br />report to command center.</i>
1090799 1093760 <i>Headquarters personnel,<br />report to command center.</i>
1093843 1095845 Take it easy.
1095929 1098014 Excuse us, please.
1100266 1102352 Princess, we have a visitor.
1103478 1106398 We picked up something<br />outside Zone 12 moving east.
1106481 1108775 - It's metal.<br />- It couldn't be one of those creatures.
1108858 1112696 - Could be one of our speeders.<br />- No. Wait.
1112779 1115490 There's something very weak coming through.
1118743 1121830 Sir, I am fluent in six million<br />forms of communication.
1121913 1125083 This signal is not used by the Alliance.<br />It could be an imperial code.
1131047 1133133 It isn't friendly. Chewie, let's check it out.
1133216 1136261 Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.
1172422 1174507 <i>- I'm afraid there's not much left.</i><br />- What was it?
1174591 1176676 <i>Droid of some kind. I didn't hit it that hard.</i>
1176760 1180263 <i>- Must have had a self-destruct.</i><br />- An imperial probe droid.
1180346 1183266 <i>It's a good bet the Empire knows we're here.</i>
1183349 1185268 We'd better start the evacuation.
1230563 1233108 - Admiral.<br />- Yes, Captain?
1234484 1237403 I think we've got something, sir.<br />The report is only a fragment...
1237487 1240406 from a probe droid in the Hoth system,<br />but it's the best lead we've had.
1240490 1243618 We have thousands of probe droids<br />searching the galaxy.
1243701 1246704 - I want proof, not leads.<br />- The visuals indicate life readings.
1246788 1249082 It could mean anything.<br />If we followed up every lead...
1249165 1252252 But, sir, the Hoth system is<br />supposed to be devoid of human forms.
1252335 1254796 - You found something?<br />- Yes, my lord.
1257173 1259509 That's it. The rebels are there.
1260426 1264097 My lord, there are so many<br />uncharted settlements.
1264180 1266975 - It could be smugglers...<br />- That is the system.
1267058 1269477 And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.
1269561 1272605 Set your course for the Hoth system.
1272689 1275150 General Veers, prepare your men.
1275233 1276609 Admiral.
1283324 1285493 Groups Seven and 10<br />will stay behind to fly the speeders.
1285577 1287453 As soon as each transport is loaded...
1287537 1289622 evacuation control<br />will give clearance for launch.
1289706 1291416 Right, sir.
1293543 1295628 All right. That's it.
1295712 1297213 Try it.
1298923 1301718 Turn it off! Turn it off!
1304053 1307473 Sir, it will take quite a while<br />to evacuate the T-47s.
1307557 1311227 Forget the heavy equipment. There's time<br />to get small modules on the transports.
1311311 1313396 - Take care, sir.<br />- Thanks.
1316774 1319944 Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
1323656 1325325 Okay, okay.
1326743 1328244 Hi, kid.
1328328 1331456 There's gotta be a reason for it.<br />Check it at the other end.
1331539 1332999 Wait a second.
1334042 1336502 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah.
1342675 1344886 Be careful.
1344969 1346888 You too.
1352936 1354854 General, there's a fleet of Stardestroyers...
1354938 1357232 coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.
1357315 1360318 Reroute all power to the energy shield.
1360401 1363529 We gotta hold them till<br />all transports are away.
1363613 1365698 Prepare for ground assault.
1379545 1382924 - What is it, General?<br />- The fleet has moved out of light speed.
1383007 1385134 Com Scan has detected an energy field...
1385218 1387845 protecting an area of the sixth planet<br />of the Hoth system.
1387929 1390431 The field is strong enough<br />to deflect any bombardment.
1390515 1393017 The rebels are alerted to our presence.
1393101 1396229 Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed<br />too close to the system.
1396312 1398606 He felt surprise was wiser.
1398690 1400817 He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
1400900 1404529 General, prepare your troops<br />for a surface attack.
1404612 1406281 Yes, my lord.
1413121 1414372 <i>Lord Vader.</i>
1414455 1417500 <i>The fleet has moved out of lightspeed,<br />and we're preparing to...</i>
1418543 1422714 You have failed me for the last time, Admiral.
1422797 1425216 - Captain Piett.<br /><i>- Yes, my lord?</i>
1425300 1428344 Make ready to land our troops<br />beyond their energy field...
1428428 1431431 and deploy the fleet so that<br />nothing gets off the system.
1431514 1434726 You are in command now, Admiral Piett.
1434809 1436686 <i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>
1438146 1441357 All troop carriers will assemble<br />at the north entrance.
1441441 1444152 The heavy transport ships<br />will leave as soon as they're loaded.
1444235 1446321 Only two fighter escorts per ship.
1446404 1449532 The energy shield<br />can only be opened for a short time...
1449615 1452160 so you'll have to stay very close<br />to your transports.
1452243 1454370 Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?
1454454 1456539 The ion cannon will fire several shots...
1456622 1459792 to make sure that any enemy ships<br />will be out of your flight path.
1459876 1462003 When you've gotten past the energy shield...
1462086 1464172 proceed directly to the rendezvous point.
1464255 1466215 Understood?
1466299 1467925 Good luck.
1468009 1470553 Everybody to your stations. Let's go.
1487612 1490740 Their primary target will be<br />the power generators.
1490823 1492742 Prepare to open shield.
1498498 1500708 Sir, rebel ships are coming into our sector.
1500792 1502919 Good. Our first catch of the day.
1504921 1507006 Stand by, ion control.
1508049 1509092 Fire.
1524273 1527402 <i>The first transport is away.</i>
1527485 1530279 <i>The first transport is away.</i>
1536744 1538663 Feeling all right, sir?
1538746 1540665 Just like new, Dak. How about you?
1540748 1543709 Right now I feel I could take on<br />the whole Empire myself.
1543793 1545920 I know what you mean.
1564188 1567525 Echo Station 3-T8.<br />We've spotted imperial walkers.
1567608 1570111 <i>Imperial walkers on the north ridge.</i>
1592175 1594510 Echo Station 57, we're on our way.
1599891 1601934 All right, boys, keep tight now.
1602018 1604187 Luke, I have no approach vector. I'm not set.
1604270 1605771 Steady, Dak.
1605855 1607732 Attack pattern Delta. Go now.
1611486 1613196 I'm coming in.
1617658 1618743 Hobbie, you still with me?
1641432 1643601 That armor's too strong for blasters.
1646020 1648231 Rogue Group, use your harpoons and tow cables.
1648314 1650566 Go for the legs. It might be our only chance.
1652860 1654153 Stand by, Dak.
1654237 1657073 Luke, we've got a malfunction in fire control.
1657156 1659200 I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
1659283 1661202 Just hang on.
1661285 1664121 Hang on, Dak.<br />Get ready to fire that tow cable.
1669502 1670545 Dak?
1694610 1697572 Yes, Lord Vader.<br />I've reached the main power generators.
1697655 1700783 The shield will be down in moments.<br />You may start your landing.
1705746 1706956 Rogue Three.
1707039 1708499 Copy, Rogue Leader.
1708583 1711586 <i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.<br />You'll have to make this shot.</i>
1711669 1713421 <i>I'll cover for you.</i>
1713504 1715923 Set your harpoon. Follow me on the next pass.
1717091 1719093 Coming around, Rogue Leader.
1721887 1723431 Steady, Rogue Two.
1724348 1725474 Activate harpoon.
1728394 1729979 Good shot, Janson.
1735943 1738321 One more pass.
1743826 1746120 Cable out. Let her go!
1746203 1747496 Detach cable.
1748164 1749332 Cable detached.
1757173 1758841 Come on!
1766641 1769268 - That got him!<br />- I see it, Wedge. Good work.
1769477 1771854 I don't think we can protect<br />two transports at a time.
1771937 1774273 It's risky, but we can't hold out much longer.
1774357 1776025 We have no choice.
1776942 1779695 - Launch patrol.<br />- Evacuate remaining ground staff.
1784492 1788079 This one goes there,<br />that one goes there. Right?
1788162 1791666 R2, you take good care<br />of Master Luke now, understand?
1793459 1795670 And do take good care of yourself.
1799298 1800883 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
1824615 1826992 All troops will debark for ground assault.
1827076 1829578 Prepare to target the main generator.
1833207 1836711 - Rogue Two, are you all right?<br />- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.
1836794 1838713 Set harpoon. I'll cover for you.
1840214 1843217 - Coming around.<br />- Watch that cross fire, boys.
1844593 1846429 Set for position three.
1846512 1847847 Steady.
1847930 1850474 Stay tight and low. This is it!
1856313 1857606 Hobbie!
1857690 1859233 I've been hit!
1901901 1904612 - You all right?<br />- Why are you still here?
1904695 1907740 - Heard the command center had been hit.<br />- You've got your clearance to leave.
1907823 1911285 Don't worry. I'll leave.<br />First I'm gonna get you to your ship.
1911368 1914497 Your Highness, we must take<br />this last transport. It's our only hope.
1914580 1917708 Send all troops in Sector 12 to<br />the south slope to protect the fighters.
1919335 1921420 <i>Imperial troops have entered the base.</i>
1921504 1923172 <i>Imperial troops have entered...</i>
1923255 1925174 Come on. That's it.
1925257 1927676 Give the evacuation code signal.
1929512 1931597 And get to your transports.
1931680 1932848 Wait for me.
1932932 1934433 Begin retreat!
1935476 1937353 Fall back!
1995077 1998414 - Distance to power generators?<br />- 17.28.
2007464 2009425 Target. Maximum firepower.
2035743 2038370 Transport, this is Solo.<br />Take off. I can't get to you.
2038454 2040456 I'll get her out on the <i>Falcon.</i> Come on.
2043000 2045127 Where are you going? Come back!
2063479 2066982 Wait! Wait for me! Stop!
2067066 2068984 - How typical.<br />- Come on.
2072696 2075699 Hurry up, goldenrod!<br />You're gonna be a permanent resident.
2075783 2077660 Wait! Wait!
2095552 2098764 - How's this?<br />- Would it help if I got out and pushed?
2098847 2101100 - Captain Solo. Captain Solo.<br />- It might.
2102351 2105062 Sir, might I suggest that you...
2105145 2106855 It can wait.
2111068 2113612 This bucket of bolts<br />will never get past that blockade.
2113696 2115823 This baby's got a few surprises left in her.
2124915 2126750 Come on! Come on!
2126834 2129878 Switch over.<br />Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
2131880 2132548 See?
2132631 2135009 Someday you'll be wrong.<br />I hope I'm there to see it.
2137803 2139013 Punch it!
2157031 2158073 R2.
2159700 2161785 Get her ready for takeoff.
2164038 2166248 Good luck, Luke. See you at the rendezvous.
2169543 2172171 Don't worry, R2. We're going. We're going.
2184266 2187936 There's nothing wrong, R2.<br />I'm just setting a new course.
2191315 2195569 We're not gonna regroup with the others.<br />We're going to the Dagobah system.
2197863 2199406 Yes, R2.
2202242 2205287 That's all right. I'd like to keep it<br />on manual control for a while.
2221929 2224348 - I saw 'em! I saw 'em!<br />- Saw what?
2224431 2226642 Stardestroyers, two of 'em coming right at us.
2226725 2229603 - Sir, might I suggest...<br />- Shut him up or shut him down!
2231313 2233398 Check the deflector shield.
2234858 2237486 Great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
2241782 2243784 Take evasive action!
2255295 2258173 - Prepare to jump to light speed.<br />- But, sir!
2259091 2260843 They're getting closer.
2260926 2263137 Oh, yeah? Watch this.
2266181 2267808 Watch what?
2269393 2271895 - I think we're in trouble.<br />- If I may say so...
2271979 2274481 I noticed earlier the hyperdrive<br />motivator has been damaged.
2274565 2277693 - It's impossible to go to light speed.<br />- We're in trouble.
2281947 2283240 Horizontal boosters!
2285409 2287494 Alluvial dampers.
2290247 2292958 That's not it. Bring me the hydrospanner.
2296420 2299131 I don't know how<br />we're gonna get out of this one.
2301800 2303051 Chewie!
2306680 2308765 That wasn't a laser blast. Something hit us.
2308849 2310350 Han, get up here.
2312019 2313478 Come on, Chewie!
2314271 2315355 Asteroids.
2319234 2321904 - Chewie, set 271.<br />- What are you doing?
2323322 2325574 You're not actually going<br />into an asteroid field?
2325657 2327451 They'd be crazy to follow us, wouldn't they?
2330621 2332581 You don't have to do this to impress me.
2332664 2335876 Sir, the possibility of successfully<br />navigating an asteroid field...
2335959 2339254 - is approximately 3,720-to-1.<br />- Never tell me the odds.
2367199 2370369 You said you wanted to be around when<br />I made a mistake. This could be it.
2370452 2372120 I take it back.
2372204 2375332 We're gonna get pulverized<br />if we stay out here much longer.
2375415 2377251 - Ain't gonna argue with that.<br />- Pulverized?
2377334 2379211 I'm going closer to one of the big ones.
2379294 2381171 - Closer?<br />- Closer?
2408240 2410158 This is suicide! There's nowhere to go.
2410242 2412244 There. That looks pretty good.
2412327 2414246 What looks pretty good?
2414329 2416748 Yeah. That'll do nicely.
2416832 2419710 Excuse me, ma'am, but where are we going?
2429636 2431888 I hope you know what you're doing.
2431972 2433473 Yeah. Me too.
2442107 2444526 Yep, that's it. Dagobah.
2446903 2449197 No, I'm not gonna change my mind about this.
2450073 2452576 I'm not picking up any cities or technology.
2452659 2454745 Massive life-form readings though.
2455787 2457873 There's something alive down there.
2459499 2462419 Yes. I'm sure it's perfectly safe for droids.
2470093 2471845 I know! I know!
2471928 2474639 All the scopes are dead. I can't see a thing.
2474723 2477851 Just hang on.<br />I'm gonna start the landing cycle.
2531905 2534616 No, R2, you stay put. I'll have a look around.
2539037 2540288 R2?
2544209 2545419 Where are you?
2549005 2550340 R2!
2557180 2558807 You be more careful.
2561768 2564646 R2, that way.
2592632 2594009 R2!
2621620 2623163 Oh, no.
2624372 2626458 Are you all right? Come on.
2629961 2632047 You were lucky to get out of there.
2633256 2635091 Anything broken?
2637802 2640931 If you're saying coming here was a bad idea...
2641014 2643225 I'm beginning to agree with ya.
2643308 2646019 R2, what are we doing here?
2646102 2647562 It's like...
2648605 2650690 something out of a dream or...
2651608 2653693 I don't know.
2653777 2655862 Maybe I'm just going crazy.
2688186 2689604 Yes, Admiral?
2689688 2691815 Our ships have sighted<br />the <i>Millennium Falcon,</i> lord...
2691898 2695026 but it has entered an asteroid field,<br />and we cannot risk...
2695110 2697946 Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.
2698029 2701616 - I want that ship, not excuses.<br />- Yes, lord.
2707706 2710834 I'm gonna shut down everything<br />but the emergency power systems.
2710917 2714921 Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does<br />that include shutting me down too?
2715005 2717090 No. I need you to talk to the <i>Falcon...</i>
2717173 2719467 find out what's wrong with the hyperdrive.
2727267 2730812 Sir, it's quite possible<br />this asteroid is not entirely stable.
2730895 2732814 Not entirely stable?
2732897 2734983 I'm glad you're here to tell us these things.
2735066 2738695 Chewie, take the professor in the back<br />and plug him into the hyperdrive.
2738778 2741323 Sometimes I just don't<br />understand human behavior.
2741406 2743783 After all, I'm only trying to do my job.
2748830 2750290 Let go.
2752083 2754419 - Let go, please.<br />- Don't get excited.
2754502 2758256 Captain, being held by you<br />isn't quite enough to get me excited.
2758340 2760216 Sorry, sweetheart.
2760300 2763011 I haven't got time for anything else.
2797420 2800882 Ready for some power? Okay.
2804844 2806304 Let's see now.
2806388 2808723 Put that in there. There you go.
2811810 2814604 Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...
2814688 2817065 if he even exists.
2822487 2825448 It's really a strange place<br />to find a Jedi master.
2826866 2828743 This place gives me the creeps.
2832622 2834082 Still...
2835333 2837419 there's something familiar about this place.
2839587 2841423 I don't know.
2841506 2843591 - I feel like...<br />- Feel like what?
2844634 2846302 Like we're being watched.
2846386 2849431 Away put your weapon. I mean you no harm.
2850640 2853393 I am wondering, why are you here?
2855019 2858064 - I'm looking for someone.<br />- Looking?
2858148 2860817 Found someone you have, I would say.
2861985 2863611 Right.
2864487 2866948 Help you I can. Yes.
2867741 2868992 I don't think so.
2870034 2873329 I'm looking for a great warrior.
2873413 2875081 Great warrior.
2878126 2880420 Wars not make one great.
2888762 2890513 Put that down.
2890597 2892599 Hey! That's my dinner.
2895852 2898605 How you get so big eating food of this kind?
2898688 2900940 Listen, friend, we didn't mean<br />to land in that puddle.
2901024 2903610 If we could get our ship out, we would.<br />But we can't.
2903693 2905820 Aw, cannot get your ship out.
2905904 2907614 Get out of there.
2910825 2913161 Hey, you could have broken this.
2914746 2916831 Don't do that.
2925882 2927967 You're making a mess.
2929427 2931513 Hey, give me that.
2931596 2934182 Mine, or I will help you not.
2934265 2936309 I don't want your help. I want my lamp back.
2936392 2938645 I'm gonna need it to get out of<br />this slimy mudhole.
2938728 2941481 Mudhole? Slimy? My home this is.
2945276 2946736 R2, let him have it.
2949364 2952158 - Mine! Mine! Mine!<br />- R2.
2956037 2959457 Will you move along, little fella?<br />We got a lot of work to do.
2960500 2963753 Stay and help you I will. Find your friend.
2964587 2967549 I'm not looking for a friend.<br />I'm looking for a Jedi master.
2969509 2972011 Jedi master. Yoda.
2972095 2974722 - You seek Yoda.<br />- You know him?
2976474 2978560 Take you to him I will.
2979769 2982939 Yes, yes, but now we must eat.
2983022 2985733 Come. Good food. Come.
2995493 2997161 Come, come.
2999163 3000456 R2...
3001291 3003585 stay and watch after the camp.
3017098 3019183 Where is R2 when I need him?
3019267 3021978 Sir, I don't know where your ship<br />learned to communicate...
3022061 3024022 but it has the most peculiar dialect.
3024105 3027650 I believe it says the power coupling<br />on the negative axis has been polarized.
3027734 3030236 I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
3031279 3033615 Well, of course I'll have to replace it.
3034782 3037076 Here. And, Chewie...
3038661 3041414 I think we better replace<br />the negative power coupling.
3063645 3066439 Hey, Your Worship, I'm only trying to help.
3066522 3069025 Would you please stop calling me that?
3069108 3071110 Sure, Leia.
3071194 3074656 - You make it so difficult sometimes.<br />- I do. I really do.
3075698 3077992 You could be a little nicer though.
3078076 3080787 Admit it. Sometimes you think I'm all right.
3082997 3085416 Occasionally, maybe...
3085500 3088002 when you aren't acting like a scoundrel.
3088086 3089545 Scoundrel?
3093466 3095218 I like the sound of that.
3096260 3099097 - Stop that.<br />- Stop what?
3099180 3101391 Stop that. My hands are dirty.
3101474 3103685 My hands are dirty too.<br />What are you afraid of?
3103768 3105979 - Afraid?<br />- You're trembling.
3106854 3108982 I'm not trembling.
3110400 3112902 You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
3112986 3115446 There aren't enough scoundrels in your life.
3115530 3117615 I happen to like nice men.
3117699 3120410 - I'm a nice man.<br />- No, you're not.
3123287 3124330 Sir, sir!
3124414 3127333 I've isolated the reverse power flux coupling.
3129544 3130795 Thank you.
3130878 3133881 - Thank you very much.<br />- You're perfectly welcome, sir.
3139929 3143099 <i>That, Lord Vader, was the last time<br />they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>
3143182 3146144 <i>Considering the damage we've sustained,<br />they must have been destroyed.</i>
3146227 3149564 No, Captain, they're alive.
3149647 3154068 I want every ship available to sweep<br />the asteroid field until they are found.
3158531 3161868 - Lord Vader.<br />- Yes, Admiral. What is it?
3161951 3164245 The emperor commands you<br />to make contact with him.
3164328 3166539 Move the ship out of the asteroid field...
3166622 3168916 so that we can send a clear transmission.
3169000 3170668 Yes, my lord.
3187226 3189812 What is thy bidding, my master?
3191064 3195151 <i>There is a great disturbance in the Force.</i>
3195985 3198362 I have felt it.
3198446 3201032 <i>We have a new enemy...</i>
3201115 3205161 <i>the young rebel who destroyed the Death Star.</i>
3205244 3208414 <i>I have no doubt this boy...</i>
3208498 3212919 <i>is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>
3213002 3215296 How is that possible?
3215379 3218800 <i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>
3218883 3222136 <i>You will know it to be true.</i>
3222220 3224722 <i>He could destroy us.</i>
3224806 3226933 He's just a boy.
3227016 3229519 Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
3229602 3233231 <i>The Force is strong with him.</i>
3234565 3239529 <i>The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi.</i>
3239612 3241823 If he could be turned...
3241906 3244826 he would become a powerful ally.
3245785 3247537 <i>Yes.</i>
3248371 3252667 <i>He would be a great asset.</i>
3252750 3255044 <i>Can it be done?</i>
3255128 3259132 He will join us or die, master.
3275731 3279694 I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't<br />understand why we can't see Yoda now.
3279777 3283614 Patience. For the Jedi,<br />it is time to eat as well.
3286993 3288995 Eat. Eat.
3289829 3291205 Hot.
3298921 3300923 Good food. Good.
3301007 3303968 How far away is Yoda?<br />Will it take us long to get there?
3304051 3306345 Not far. Yoda not far.
3306429 3309223 Patience. Soon you will be with him.
3311601 3314312 Root leaf. I cook.
3316105 3318608 Why wish you become Jedi?
3319650 3322361 Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.
3322445 3325573 Father. Powerful Jedi was he.
3327033 3328868 - Powerful Jedi.<br />- Oh, come on.
3329660 3332455 How could you know my father?<br />You don't even know who I am.
3332538 3336083 I don't even know what I'm doing here.<br />We're wasting our time!
3337460 3339795 I cannot teach him.
3339879 3341964 The boy has no patience.
3342048 3344342 <i>He will learn patience.</i>
3349138 3351557 Much anger in him...
3351641 3353517 like his father.
3353601 3357396 <i>Was I any different when you taught me?</i>
3358689 3359690 No.
3360608 3363903 - He is not ready.<br />- Yoda.
3366948 3368824 I am ready.
3368908 3371869 I can be a Jedi. Ben, tell him I'm...
3371953 3375831 Ready, are you? What know you ready?
3375915 3379919 For 800 years have I trained Jedi.
3380002 3383798 My own counsel will I keep<br />on who is to be trained.
3385716 3389553 A Jedi must have the deepest commitment...
3389637 3391514 the most serious mind.
3393474 3396602 This one a long time have I watched.
3397645 3400439 All his life has he looked away...
3400523 3403609 to the future, to the horizon.
3403693 3407321 Never his mind on where he was...
3408572 3410658 what he was doing.
3412326 3413369 Adventure.
3414704 3416372 Excitement.
3416455 3418791 A Jedi craves not these things.
3419667 3421502 You are reckless.
3421585 3424588 <i>So was I, if you remember.</i>
3424672 3426757 He is too old.
3428718 3430928 Yes, too old to begin the training.
3431012 3433014 But I've learned so much.
3440771 3444066 - Will he finish what he begins?<br />- I won't fail you.
3445568 3447278 I'm not afraid.
3451741 3453826 You will be.
3454952 3457038 You will be.
3499080 3502625 - Sir, if I may venture an opinion...<br />- I'm not interested in your opinion.
3502708 3504752 There's something out there.
3504835 3506879 - Where?<br />- Outside in the cave.
3508506 3510049 There it is. Listen!
3510132 3512051 - I'm going out there.<br />- Are you crazy?
3512134 3514720 I just got this bucket together.<br />I won't let it get torn apart.
3514804 3516972 Then I'm going with you.
3518182 3521310 I think it might be better<br />if I stay behind and guard the ship.
3521394 3522436 Oh, no.
3537493 3539578 This ground sure feels strange.
3541163 3543249 It doesn't feel like rock.
3547711 3550339 There's an awful lot of moisture in here.
3550423 3554176 I don't know. I have a bad feeling about this.
3554260 3555511 Yeah.
3557555 3558514 Watch out!
3559598 3562101 It's all right. It's all right.
3562184 3564687 Yeah, that's what I thought... mynock.
3564770 3567940 Chewie, check the rest of the ship and<br />make sure there are no more attached...
3568023 3569942 chewing on the power cables.
3570025 3571652 Mynocks?
3571735 3573988 Go inside. We'll clean them off<br />if there are any more.
3583122 3585666 Go away! Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!
3592882 3594758 Wait a minute.
3616447 3619909 - Chewie, let's get out of here!<br />- The Empire is still out there!
3619992 3622077 No time to discuss this in committee!
3622912 3624997 I am not a committee!
3630419 3633297 You can't make the jump to light speed<br />in this asteroid field.
3633380 3635883 Sit down, sweetheart. We're taking off.
3640638 3642014 - Look!<br />- I see it.
3642097 3644517 - We're doomed!<br />- The cave is collapsing.
3644600 3646560 - This is no cave.<br />- What?
3678968 3680386 Yes, run.
3680469 3682054 Yes.
3682137 3685516 A Jedi's strength flows from the Force.
3685599 3689061 But beware of the dark side.<br />Anger, fear, aggression...
3689144 3691355 The dark side of the Force are they.
3691438 3695067 Easily they flow,<br />quick to join you in a fight.
3695150 3697403 If once you start down the dark path...
3697486 3699822 forever will it dominate your destiny.
3699905 3703909 Consume you it will,<br />as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
3703993 3705869 Vader.
3705953 3709081 - Is the dark side stronger?<br />- No, no.
3710791 3712793 Quicker, easier, more seductive.
3713627 3715754 How am I to know the good side from the bad?
3715838 3718132 You will know...
3718215 3720509 when you are calm, at peace...
3721552 3723012 passive.
3724054 3728267 A Jedi uses the Force<br />for knowledge and defense...
3728350 3730227 never for attack.
3730311 3733981 - But tell me why I can't...<br />- No. There is no why.
3734064 3736859 Nothing more will I teach you today.
3736942 3738986 Clear your mind of questions.
3762009 3764011 There's something not right here.
3767848 3769350 I feel cold.
3770142 3771727 - Death.<br />- That place...
3772811 3776357 is strong with the dark side of the Force.
3776440 3778400 A domain of evil it is.
3779818 3781820 In you must go.
3782946 3784198 What's in there?
3786784 3789244 Only what you take with you.
3792998 3794249 Your weapons...
3795084 3796585 you will not need them.
3956662 3959122 Bounty hunters. We don't need their scum.
3959206 3962209 - Yes, sir.<br />- Those rebels won't escape us.
3967840 3971176 Sir, we have a priority signal<br />from the Stardestroyer <i>Avenger.</i>
3971260 3972845 Right.
3972928 3978767 There will be a substantial reward for<br />the one who finds the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>
3978851 3981937 You are free to use any methods necessary...
3982020 3984189 but I want them alive.
3984273 3986733 No disintegrations.
3986817 3988735 - As you wish.<br />- Lord Vader.
3990946 3992906 My lord, we have them.
3997327 4000455 Thank goodness<br />we're coming out of the asteroid field.
4005669 4008171 Let's get out of here. Ready for light speed?
4008255 4010632 One, two...
4010716 4011884 three!
4018473 4020767 It's not fair.
4022477 4025147 Transfer circuits aren't working.<br />It's not my fault.
4025230 4028233 - No light speed?<br />- It's not my fault.
4032946 4034990 Sir, we just lost<br />the main rear deflector shield.
4035073 4037367 One more direct hit<br />on the back quarter and we're done for.
4037451 4039202 Turn her around.
4039286 4041955 Turn her around! I'm gonna<br />put all power in the front shield.
4042039 4044082 - You're gonna attack?<br />- The odds of surviving...
4044166 4046126 a direct assault<br />on an imperial Stardestroyer...
4046209 4048170 Shut up!
4054635 4056637 They're moving to attack position.
4058805 4059973 Shields up.
4066480 4068398 Track them. They may<br />come around for another pass.
4068482 4071443 Captain Needa, the ship no longer<br />appears on our scopes.
4071526 4075364 They can't have disappeared. No ship<br />that small has a cloaking device.
4075447 4079326 - There's no trace of them.<br />- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.
4082120 4084373 Get a shuttle ready.
4084456 4088418 I shall assume full responsibility for<br />losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.
4088502 4091630 - Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.<br />- Yes, Captain Needa.
4096301 4098595 Use the Force.
4098679 4099721 Yes.
4104810 4107104 Now, the stone.
4111233 4112901 Feel it.
4124579 4126415 Concentrate!
4141054 4144141 Oh, no. We'll never get it out now.
4144224 4146018 So certain are you.
4150022 4153275 Always with you it cannot be done.
4154484 4156486 Hear you nothing that I say?
4156570 4158697 Master, moving stones around is one thing.
4158780 4160657 This is totally different.
4160741 4163035 No. No different.
4163118 4165245 Only different in your mind.
4165328 4168582 You must unlearn what you have learned.
4169916 4173086 - All right. I'll give it a try.<br />- Try not.
4173879 4175338 Do...
4175422 4177049 or do not.
4177132 4178884 There is no try.
4227307 4230393 I can't. It's too big.
4230477 4232562 Size matters not.
4232646 4235690 Look at me. Judge me by my size, do you?
4238401 4241321 And well you should not...
4241404 4244074 for my ally is the Force.
4244157 4246576 And a powerful ally it is.
4247619 4250038 Life creates it...
4250122 4252207 makes it grow.
4253041 4255877 Its energy surrounds us...
4256878 4258713 and binds us.
4258797 4262050 Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter.
4263093 4266388 You must feel the Force around you.
4267013 4269850 Here, between you, me...
4270517 4274521 the tree, the rock... everywhere.
4274604 4276606 Yes...
4276690 4280694 even between the land and the ship.
4285365 4287826 You want the impossible.
4395183 4397435 I don't believe it.
4399187 4402065 That is why you fail.
4421167 4424587 Apology accepted, Captain Needa.
4433054 4436141 Lord Vader, our ships have completed<br />their scan and found nothing.
4436224 4438226 If the <i>Millennium Falcon</i><br />went into light speed...
4438310 4440270 it'll be on the other side of the galaxy now.
4440353 4442105 Alert all commands.
4442188 4446609 Calculate every possible destination<br />along their last known trajectory.
4446693 4450155 - Yes, my lord. We'll find them.<br />- Don't fail me again...
4451031 4453074 Admiral.
4455201 4458538 Alert all commands. Deploy the fleet.
4473219 4476723 Captain Solo, this time you have gone too far.
4476806 4479934 I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.<br />Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
4480018 4482103 The fleet's beginning to break up.
4482187 4485106 Go stand by the manual release<br />for the landing claw.
4487400 4489444 I really don't see how that's going to help.
4489527 4493031 Surrender is a perfectly acceptable<br />alternative in extreme circumstances.
4493114 4495241 The Empire may be gracious enough...
4495325 4497786 - Thank you.<br />- What did you have in mind next?
4497869 4499829 If they follow standard imperial procedure...
4499913 4502123 they'll dump their garbage<br />before they go to light speed.
4502207 4505335 - Then we just float away.<br />- With the rest of the garbage.
4505418 4506878 Then what?
4506961 4510256 Then we gotta find a safe port<br />somewhere around here.
4510340 4511758 Any ideas?
4511841 4514260 - Where are we?<br />- The Anoat system.
4514344 4516971 The Anoat system. There's not much there.
4517055 4519933 Oh, wait. This is interesting.
4520016 4522936 - Lando.<br />- Lando system?
4523019 4526648 Lando's not a system.<br />He's a man. Lando Calrissian.
4526731 4529025 Cardplayer, gambler.
4529109 4531736 - A scoundrel. You'd like him.<br />- Thanks.
4531820 4534531 Bespin. It's pretty far,<br />but I think we can make it.
4535990 4539077 - A mining colony?<br />- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.
4539911 4542080 Lando conned somebody out of it.
4542163 4544916 We go back a long way, Lando and me.
4546292 4549003 - Can you trust him?<br />- No.
4549087 4552006 But he's got no love for the Empire.<br />I can tell you that.
4552841 4555760 Here we go, Chewie. Stand by. Detach.
4562892 4564477 You do have your moments.
4565145 4568106 Not many of them, but you do have them.
4602932 4604893 Concentrate.
4604976 4608229 Feel the Force flow.
4608313 4610023 Yes.
4617614 4619324 Good.
4619407 4620825 Calm.
4620909 4622327 Yes.
4622994 4625788 Through the Force, things you will see.
4625872 4629375 Other places. The future. The past.
4629459 4631920 Old friends long gone.
4642388 4643890 Control, control.
4643973 4646226 You must learn control.
4649062 4652232 I saw a city in the clouds.
4654234 4656444 Friends you have there.
4657487 4661199 - They were in pain.<br />- It is the future you see.
4662325 4663409 Future?
4672335 4673795 Will they die?
4677006 4679133 Difficult to see.
4679217 4681761 Always in motion is the future.
4684180 4685640 I've gotta go to them.
4687433 4690687 Decide you must how to serve them best.
4690770 4693690 If you leave now, help them you could...
4694732 4698319 but you would destroy all<br />for which they have fought and suffered.
4712000 4715169 No, I don't have a landing permit.
4715253 4718923 I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
4719007 4721175 Wait a minute! Let me explain!
4721259 4723261 <i>You will not deviate from your present course.</i>
4723344 4726139 - Rather touchy, aren't they?<br />- I thought you knew this person.
4728975 4731811 That was a long time ago.<br />I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
4740361 4744032 <i>Permission granted to land on Platform 327.</i>
4744115 4745533 Thank you.
4746409 4749329 Nothing to worry about.<br />We go way back, Lando and me.
4749412 4751164 Who's worried?
4799962 4801381 No one to meet us.
4802757 4805134 I don't like this.
4805218 4808096 - What would you like?<br />- They did let us land.
4808179 4810932 Look, don't worry. Everything's gonna be fine.
4811015 4812725 Trust me.
4817230 4819482 See? My friend.
4823695 4825947 Keep your eyes open.
4828408 4830284 Hey.
4830368 4834497 Why, you slimy, double-crossing,<br />no-good swindler.
4834580 4838876 You've got a lot of guts coming here,<br />after what you pulled.
4849303 4852807 How you doin', you old pirate?<br />So good to see you!
4852890 4855977 - I never thought I'd see you again.<br />- Well, he seems very friendly.
4856060 4859188 Yes. Very friendly.
4859272 4860940 What are you doing here?
4861023 4863067 Repairs. I thought you could help me out.
4863151 4865820 - What have you done to my ship?<br />- Your ship?
4865903 4869490 Hey, remember,<br />you lost her to me fair and square.
4870324 4871784 How you doin', Chewbacca?
4872452 4875413 Still hanging around with this loser?
4877331 4879751 Hello. What have we here?
4880668 4884589 Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.<br />I'm the administrator of this facility.
4884672 4887800 - And who might you be?<br />- Leia.
4887884 4889552 Welcome, Leia.
4892346 4895224 All right, all right. You old smoothie.
4895308 4898686 Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,<br />human-cyborg relations.
4898770 4901898 My facilities are at your... Well, really!
4901981 4904400 - What's wrong with the <i>Falcon</i>?<br />- Hyperdrive.
4904484 4906569 - I'll get my people to work on her.<br />- Good.
4906652 4908738 That ship saved my life quite a few times.
4908821 4911407 She's the fastest hunk of junk in the galaxy.
4912700 4915203 How's the gas mine? Still paying off for you?
4915286 4919165 Not as well as I'd like. We're a small<br />outpost and not very self-sufficient.
4919248 4922376 I've had supply problems of every kind.
4922460 4924670 I've had labor difficulties.
4924754 4928049 - What's so funny?<br />- You. Listen to you.
4928132 4930968 You sound like a businessman,<br />a responsible leader.
4931052 4932970 Who'd have thought that, huh?
4933054 4936015 Seeing you sure brings back a few things.
4936098 4937350 Yeah.
4937433 4939602 Yeah, I'm responsible these days.
4940436 4943147 It's the price you pay for being successful.
4946359 4948444 Nice to see a familiar face.
4948528 4950196 How rude!
4951739 4953825 That sounds like an R2 unit in there.
4953908 4955535 I wonder if... Hello?
4957745 4959330 How interesting.
4959413 4962542 - Who are you?<br />- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.
4962625 4964710 I didn't mean to intrude. Please don't get up.
4983145 4985773 Luke, you must complete the training.
4986816 4989652 I can't keep the vision out of my head.<br />I've gotta help them.
4989735 4991904 You must not go.
4991988 4995116 - But Han and Leia will die if I don't.<br /><i>- You don't know that.</i>
4997952 5000788 Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
5000872 5003666 But I can help them. I feel the Force.
5003749 5005960 But you cannot control it.
5006043 5008504 This is a dangerous time for you...
5008588 5011632 when you will be tempted<br />by the dark side of the Force.
5011716 5014969 Yes, yes. To Obi-Wan you listen.
5015678 5017263 The cave.
5017346 5019473 Remember your failure at the cave.
5019557 5021517 But I've learned so much since then.
5021601 5024312 Master Yoda, I promise to return<br />and finish what I've begun.
5024395 5026397 You have my word.
5026480 5029317 It is you and your abilities<br />the emperor wants.
5029400 5032153 That is why your friends are made to suffer.
5033571 5036282 That's why I have to go.
5036365 5040745 Luke, I don't want to lose you<br />to the emperor the way I lost Vader.
5040828 5042413 You won't.
5043164 5046834 Stopped they must be. On this all depends.
5047376 5051172 Only a fully trained Jedi knight,<br />with the Force as his ally...
5051255 5053883 will conquer Vader and his emperor.
5053966 5056093 If you end your training now...
5056177 5060514 if you choose the quick and easy path,<br />as Vader did...
5060598 5063267 you will become an agent of evil.
5063351 5064352 Patience.
5065269 5069690 - And sacrifice Han and Leia?<br />- If you honor what they fight for...
5069774 5070816 yes.
5070900 5074028 If you choose to face Vader,<br />you will do it alone.
5074111 5076155 I cannot interfere.
5078115 5079492 I understand.
5084914 5087792 R2, fire up the converters.
5093089 5095091 Don't give in to hate.
5095174 5097969 That leads to the dark side.
5098052 5099804 Strong is Vader.
5099887 5102473 Mind what you have learned. Save you it can.
5103349 5104892 I will.
5104976 5107478 And I'll return. I promise.
5114527 5117613 Told you, I did. Reckless is he.
5117697 5119323 Now...
5119407 5121200 matters are worse.
5121283 5123369 <i>That boy is our last hope.</i>
5123452 5126414 No, there is another.
5158529 5161866 The ship's almost finished. Two or three<br />more things and we're in great shape.
5161949 5164035 The sooner the better. Something's wrong here.
5164118 5166203 No one has seen or knows anything about 3PO.
5166287 5168539 He's been gone too long to have gotten lost.
5168622 5170374 Relax.
5170458 5173377 I'll talk to Lando<br />and see what I can find out.
5173461 5175963 I don't trust Lando.
5176047 5179425 Well, I don't trust him either,<br />but he is my friend.
5179508 5182219 Besides, we'll soon be gone.
5183637 5185723 Then you're as good as gone, aren't you?
5220716 5222259 What happened?
5223302 5224011 Where?
5226138 5228182 Found him in a junk pile?
5228265 5230851 What a mess.<br />Chewie, you think you can repair him?
5232978 5236524 - Lando's got people that can fix him.<br />- No, thanks.
5238067 5239985 I'm sorry. Am I interrupting anything?
5240861 5242029 Not really.
5245533 5247576 You look absolutely beautiful.
5247660 5250996 You truly belong here<br />with us among the clouds.
5251080 5252581 Thank you.
5252665 5255626 Would you join me for a little refreshment?
5255709 5258546 Everyone's invited, of course.
5258629 5260756 Having trouble with your droid?
5260840 5263509 No. No problem. Why?
5272309 5274854 You see, since we're a small operation...
5274937 5278232 we don't fall into<br />the jurisdiction of the Empire.
5278315 5280901 - So you're part of the Mining Guild?<br />- No, not actually.
5280985 5283195 Our operation is small enough<br />not to be noticed.
5283279 5285364 Which is advantageous for everybody...
5285447 5289910 since our customers are anxious to avoid<br />attracting attention to themselves.
5289994 5293914 Aren't you afraid the Empire's<br />gonna find out, shut you down?
5293998 5297334 It's been a danger that looms like<br />a shadow over everything we've built.
5297418 5300171 But things have developed<br />that'll ensure security.
5300254 5303591 I've just made a deal that'll keep<br />the Empire out of here forever.
5313267 5316103 We would be honored if you would join us.
5322902 5325404 I had no choice.<br />They arrived right before you did.
5326197 5328032 I'm sorry.
5331452 5332870 I'm sorry too.
5347635 5349094 No, 3PO's with them.
5350429 5352598 Just hang on. We're almost there.
5412074 5414576 I'm terribly sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.
5414660 5416662 No, please don't get up.
5422334 5425879 Stormtroopers? Here? We're in danger.
5425963 5428590 I must tell the others.<br />Oh, no! I've been shot!
5456285 5458037 Lord Vader.
5458120 5460539 You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt...
5460622 5462666 after I have Skywalker.
5462750 5464668 He's no good to me dead.
5464752 5468088 He will not be permanently damaged.
5470466 5473052 Lord Vader, what about Leia and the Wookiee?
5473135 5475888 They must never again leave this city.
5475971 5479224 That wasn't part of our agreement,<br />nor was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
5479308 5483270 Perhaps you think you're<br />being treated unfairly?
5485981 5487024 No.
5487107 5490736 Good. It would be unfortunate<br />if I had to leave a garrison here.
5493072 5495491 This deal is getting worse all the time.
5496658 5499078 Oh, yes, that's very good. I like that.
5500662 5503248 Something's not right because now I can't see.
5505751 5508003 That's much better.
5508087 5509755 Wait. Wait.
5509838 5511924 Oh, my! What have you done?
5512007 5513592 I'm backwards!
5513675 5515594 You flea-bitten furball!
5515677 5518389 Only an overgrown mophead like you<br />would be stupid enough...
5532945 5534947 I feel terrible.
5550170 5552256 Why are they doing this?
5554716 5557428 They never even asked me any questions.
5566728 5568939 - Get out of here, Lando.<br />- Shut up and listen.
5569022 5572151 Vader's agreed<br />to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
5572234 5574153 They'll have to stay here,<br />but they'll be safe.
5574236 5576405 - And Han?<br />- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.
5576488 5578949 - Vader wants us all dead.<br />- He doesn't want you at all.
5579032 5582453 He's after somebody called Skywalker.
5582536 5585122 - Lord Vader set a trap for him.<br />- And we're the bait.
5585205 5587124 - He's on his way.<br />- Perfect.
5588000 5590252 You fixed us all real good, didn't you?
5590335 5591545 My friend.
5593839 5595048 Stop!
5597009 5599219 I've done all I can.
5599303 5601763 Sorry I couldn't do better,<br />but I got my own problems.
5601847 5603182 Yeah.
5603265 5605184 You're a real hero.
5615903 5618405 You certainly have a way with people.
5632753 5634630 This facility is crude...
5634713 5637841 but it should be adequate<br />to freeze Skywalker...
5637925 5640219 for his journey to the emperor.
5640302 5643347 Lord Vader, ship approaching, X-wing class.
5643430 5646850 Good. Monitor Skywalker and allow him to land.
5648352 5653106 Lord Vader, we only use this facility<br />for carbon freezing. It might kill him.
5653190 5656109 I do not want the emperor's prize damaged.
5656193 5659321 We will test it on Captain Solo.
5683053 5687307 If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't<br />be in this ridiculous position.
5687391 5690102 Now remember, Chewbacca,<br />you have a responsibility for me...
5690185 5691937 so don't do anything foolish.
5705909 5708120 What's going on, buddy?
5708954 5711123 You're being put into carbon freeze.
5711206 5714751 What if he doesn't survive?<br />He's worth a lot to me.
5714835 5718297 The Empire will compensate you<br />if he dies. Put him in.
5722175 5723385 Chewbacca, stop!
5723468 5725512 No, Chewie, stop!
5725596 5728640 You're going to get us all killed!<br />Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.
5728724 5730726 Hey! Hey! Listen to me.
5730809 5733353 Chewie, this won't help me.
5733437 5736106 Hey, save your strength.<br />There'll be another time.
5737899 5739568 The princess.
5739651 5741486 You have to take care of her.
5743655 5745699 Do you hear me?
5759546 5762549 - I love you.<br />- I know.
5791703 5795374 What's going on? Turn round. I can't see.
5854474 5856268 They've encased him in carbonite.
5856351 5858270 He should be quite well-protected...
5858353 5860313 if he survived the freezing process, that is.
5860397 5862941 Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
5863024 5864693 Yes, he's alive.
5865527 5867446 And in perfect hibernation.
5868363 5870574 He's all yours, bounty hunter.
5871366 5873118 Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
5875495 5877372 Skywalker has just landed, lord.
5877456 5881418 Good. See to it that he finds his way in here.
5885589 5887507 Calrissian...
5887591 5890051 take the princess and the Wookiee to my ship.
5890135 5892304 You said they'd be left under my supervision.
5892387 5897309 I am altering the deal.<br />Pray I don't alter it any further.
5994531 5997117 Luke, don't! It's a trap!
5998577 5999744 It's a trap!
6046082 6048501 The Force is with you, young Skywalker.
6050879 6052964 But you are not a Jedi yet.
6114859 6116611 Well done.
6118363 6121199 Hold them in the security tower.<br />And keep it quiet.
6121282 6123034 Move.
6127414 6130750 - What do you think you're doing?<br />- We're getting out of here.
6130834 6132627 I knew all along. It had to be a mistake.
6132711 6135588 Do you think that after what you did to Han...
6136548 6139884 - I had no choice.<br />- What are you doing? Trust him!
6139968 6143013 We understand, don't we, Chewie?<br />He had no choice.
6143096 6144681 I'm just trying to help.
6144764 6147434 We don't need any of your help.
6152522 6154065 What?
6154149 6158778 - It sounds like Han.<br />- There's still a chance to save Han...
6159696 6163033 at the east... platform.
6167162 6169330 I'm terribly sorry about all this.
6169414 6171249 After all, he's only a Wookiee.
6172125 6174836 Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
6190018 6192312 R2, where have you been?
6192395 6194314 Wait. Turn around, you woolly...
6195482 6198276 Hurry! We're trying to save<br />Han from the bounty hunter.
6200987 6203448 Well, at least you're still in one piece.
6203531 6205950 Look what's happened to me.
6217837 6220465 Oh, no! Chewie, they're behind you!
6233394 6235772 You have learned much, young one.
6235855 6237982 You'll find I'm full of surprises.
6249577 6252705 Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.
6253414 6256042 Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
6264092 6265510 All too easy.
6270682 6273184 Perhaps you're not as strong<br />as the emperor thought.
6276312 6278022 Impressive.
6279899 6281359 Most impressive.
6289075 6292912 Obi-Wan has taught you well.<br />You have controlled your fear.
6295665 6298918 Now, release your anger.
6299002 6301671 Only your hatred can destroy me.
6432552 6434512 The security code has been changed.
6434595 6437974 R2, you can tell the computer<br />to override the security systems.
6438850 6440601 R2, hurry.
6443354 6446190 <i>Attention.<br />This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.</i>
6446274 6448276 <i>The Empire has taken control of the city.</i>
6448359 6451237 <i>I advise everyone to leave<br />before more imperial troops arrive.</i>
6457702 6459370 This way.
6459454 6461706 Well, don't blame me. I'm an interpreter.
6461789 6464709 I'm not supposed to know a power socket<br />from a computer terminal.
6486272 6489233 We're not interested in the hyperdrive<br />on the <i>Falcon.</i> It's fixed!
6493696 6497075 Just open the door, you stupid lump!
6505583 6508086 I never doubted you for a second. Wonderful!
6532527 6535279 That hurts! Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!
6542370 6543788 Go!
6550169 6553005 I thought that hairy beast<br />would be the end of me.
6553089 6555007 Of course I've looked better.
6608644 6612356 You are beaten. It is useless to resist.
6612440 6615985 Don't let yourself be destroyed<br />as Obi-Wan did.
6631751 6633419 There is no escape.
6634253 6636422 Don't make me destroy you.
6640218 6643179 You do not yet realize your importance.
6643262 6645973 You have only begun to discover your power.
6646057 6647934 Join me...
6648017 6650436 and I will complete your training.
6650520 6652939 With our combined strength...
6653022 6655983 we can end this destructive conflict...
6656067 6658402 and bring order to the galaxy.
6658486 6661030 I'll never join you!
6661113 6665243 If you only knew the power of the dark side.
6665326 6669580 Obi-Wan never told you<br />what happened to your father.
6669664 6671123 He told me enough.
6673709 6675586 He told me you killed him.
6677338 6679465 I am your father.
6687974 6689934 That's not true.
6690768 6692436 That's impossible!
6692520 6695815 Search your feelings. You know it to be true.
6704615 6708786 You can destroy the emperor.<br />He has foreseen this.
6708869 6711789 It is your destiny.
6711872 6713624 Join me...
6713708 6718087 and together we can rule the galaxy<br />as father and son.
6728639 6730308 Come with me.
6731142 6733352 It is the only way.
6799585 6801003 Ben.
6801837 6803714 Ben, please.
6831617 6833244 Hear me.
6840167 6842253 - We've got to go back.<br />- What?
6842336 6844755 - I know where Luke is.<br />- What about those fighters?
6845798 6848092 Chewie, just do it.
6848175 6849927 All right, all right!
6858102 6862231 Alert my Stardestroyer<br />to prepare for my arrival.
6872700 6874785 Look, someone's up there.
6875995 6878497 It's Luke. Chewie, slow down.
6878581 6881917 We'll get under him.<br />Lando, open the top hatch.
6897808 6900186 Okay. Easy, Chewie.
6921916 6924126 - Lando?<br /><i>- Okay, let's go.</i>
6944104 6945564 All right, Chewie. Let's go.
6981100 6982977 I'll be back.
6988649 6990109 Stardestroyer.
6995322 6997825 All right, Chewie. Ready for light speed.
6997908 6999994 If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
7000077 7002454 All the coordinates are set.<br />It's now or never.
7002538 7004039 Punch it!
7014675 7017011 They told me they fixed it.
7017094 7019013 I trusted them!
7019096 7021640 It's not my fault!
7027229 7029899 They'll be in range<br />of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
7029982 7033569 Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive<br />on the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>
7033652 7035696 - Yes, my lord.<br />- Good.
7035779 7039450 Prepare the boarding party<br />and set your weapons for stun.
7039533 7042620 - Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.<br />- Yes, sir.
7044121 7047458 Noisy brute. Why don't we<br />just go into light speed?
7047541 7049168 We can't?
7049251 7051670 How would you know<br />the hyperdrive is deactivated?
7054924 7057843 The city's central computer told you?
7057927 7060721 R2-D2, you know better<br />than to trust a strange computer.
7060804 7064141 Ouch! Pay attention to what you're doing.
7076403 7077613 Father.
7079448 7081617 Son, come with me.
7084620 7086080 Ben.
7087122 7089249 Why didn't you tell me?
7107434 7108686 It's Vader.
7114483 7118112 Luke, it is your destiny.
7125786 7128080 Why didn't you tell me?
7134336 7138340 Alert all commands.<br />Ready for the tractor beam.
7141719 7144513 R2, come back at once!<br />You haven't finished with me yet.
7144596 7148142 You don't know how to fix the<br />hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.
7148225 7152730 I'm standing here in pieces<br />and you're having delusions of grandeur!
7155816 7157359 You did it!
7215000 7218087 - Luke, we're ready for takeoff.<br /><i>- Goodluck, Lando.</i>
7219046 7223050 <i>When we find Jabba the Hutt and<br />that bounty hunter, we'll contact you.</i>
7223133 7225803 I'll meet you at<br />the rendezvous point on Tatooine.
7225886 7229348 Princess, we'll find Han. I promise.
7229431 7231683 Chewie, I'll be waiting for your signal.
7231767 7233519 Take care, you two.
7233602 7235687 <i>May the Force be with you.</i>
7639174 7640175 English - US
