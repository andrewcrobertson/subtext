213479 217383 Echo Three to Echo Seven.<br />Han, old buddy, do you read me?
217483 219683 <i>Loud and clear, kid.</i><br /><i>What’s up?</i>
219885 222522 Well, I finished my circle.<br />I don’t pick up any life readings.
222622 225658 <i>There isn’t enough life on this ice cube<br />to fill a space cruiser.</i>
225758 229395 - <i>Sensors are placed. I’m going back.</i><br />- Right. I’ll see you shortly.
229495 233898 There’s a meteorite that hit the ground near<br />here. I want to check it out. It won’t take long.
235000 238392 Steady, hey, steady, girl.<br />Hey, what’s the matter?
238571 240072 You smell something?
281080 285781 Chewie! Chewie?<br />Chewie!
289523 293523 All right! Don’t lose your temper.<br />I’ll come right back and give you a hand.
314379 316878 - Solo.<br />- No sign of life out there, General.
317249 319561 The sensors are in place. You’ll know<br />if anything comes around.
319585 321486 Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
321586 323856 No. He’s checking out<br />a meteorite that hit near him.
323956 327803 With all the meteor activity in this system, it’s<br />going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
327827 331263 - General, I’ve got to leave. I can’t<br />stay anymore. - I’m sorry to hear that.
331363 334962 Well, there’s a price on my head. If I don’t<br />pay off Jabba the Hutt, I’m a dead man.
335434 339834 A death mark’s not an easy thing to<br />live with. You’re a good fighter, Solo.
340000 342840 - I hate to lose you.<br />- Thank you, General.
351115 354886 - Well, Your Highness, guess this is it.<br />- That’s right.
357954 360152 Well, don’t get all mushy on me.<br />So long, Princess.
363228 364992 Han!
365964 369102 - Yes, Your Highnessness?<br />- I thought you had decided to stay.
369202 372171 Well, the bounty hunter we ran into<br />on Ord Mantell changed my mind.
372271 374330 Han, we need you!
374907 376776 - <i>We</i> need?<br />- Yes.
376876 378976 - Well, what about <i>you</i> need?<br />- <i>I</i> need?
379345 383045 - I don’t know what you’re talking about.<br />- You probably don’t.
383600 386619 - And what precisely am I supposed to know?<br />- Come on!
386719 388988 You want me to stay<br />because of the way you feel about me.
389088 391789 Yes! You’re a great help to us.<br />You’re a natural leader.
391958 395993 No! That’s not it.<br />Come on.
396862 399021 - A-ha! Come on.<br />- You’re imagining things.
399798 401500 Am I? Then why are you following me?
401767 403946 Afraid I was gonna leave<br />without giving you a good-bye kiss?
403970 406673 - I’d just as soon kiss a Wookiee!<br />- I can arrange that.
406773 408964 You could use a good kiss!
409909 412557 Don’t try to blame me. I didn’t ask<br />you to turn on the thermal heater.
412581 415679 I merely commented that it was<br />freezing in the princess’s chamber.
416583 417851 But it’s supposed to be freezing!
417875 420583 How we’re going to dry out all<br />of her clothes, I really don’t know.
420886 422055 Oh, switch off!
422155 424732 Why did you take this apart now?<br />I’m trying to get us out of here...
424756 426569 - ...and you pull both of these-<br />- Excuse me, sir.
426593 429037 - Put them back together, right now!<br />- Might I have a word with you, please?
429061 431831 - What do you want? - Well, it’s<br />Princess Leia, sir. She’s been trying...
431855 434643 - ...to get you on the communicator. - I<br />turned it off. I don’t want to talk to her.
434667 436903 Well, Princess Leia is wondering<br />about Master Luke.
437003 438981 He hasn’t come back yet.<br />She doesn’t know where he is.
439005 441016 - I don’t know where he is.<br />- Nobody knows where he is.
441040 443017 - What do you mean, nobody knows?<br />- Well, uh, you see-
443041 446178 - Deck Officer! Deck Officer!<br />- Excuse me, sir, might I-
446278 448438 - Yes, sir?<br />- Do you know where Commander Skywalker is?
448481 451417 I haven’t seen him. It’s possible<br />he came in through the south entrance.
451517 455288 It’s possible? Why don’t you go find out?<br />It’s getting dark out there.
455388 456789 Yes, sir.
456889 458891 Excuse me, sir.<br />Might I inquire what’s going on?
458991 460392 Why not?
460492 462927 Impossible man. Come along, R2,<br />let’s find Princess Leia.
463595 466891 Between ourselves, I think Master Luke is<br />in considerable danger.
476476 478720 Sir, Commander Skywalker<br />hasn’t come in the south entrance.
478744 481356 - He might have forgotten to check in.<br />- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
481380 483559 Uh, not yet. We’re having some trouble<br />adapting them to the cold.
483583 486628 - We’ll have to go out on tauntauns. - Sir,<br />the temperature’s dropping too rapidly!
486652 488950 That’s right, and my friend’s out in it.
493459 495819 Your tauntaun will freeze<br />before you reach the first marker.
495895 498095 Then I’ll see you in Hell!
626826 630486 You must come along now, R2.<br />There’s really nothing more we can do.
630863 633063 And my joints are freezing up.
634000 636925 Don’t say things like that!<br />Of course we’ll see Master Luke again.
638203 640437 And he’ll be quite all right.<br />You’ll see.
640906 644568 Stupid little short circuit.<br />He’ll be quite all right.
702201 705092 Sir, all the patrols are in. Still no-
706505 709106 Still no contact from Skywalker or Solo.
709475 713300 Mistress Leia, R2 says he’s been<br />quite unable to pick up any signals
713412 717149 although he does admit that his own<br />range is far too weak to abandon all hope.
717249 719325 Your Highness, there’s<br />nothing more we can do tonight.
719349 721449 The shield doors must be closed.
723322 724922 - Close the doors.<br />- Yes, sir.
726924 731787 R2 says the chances<br />of survival are 725 to 1.
743100 746840 Actually, R2 has been known<br />to make mistakes...
749548 753040 ...from time to time.<br />Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
756555 759458 Don’t worry about Master Luke.<br />I’m sure he’ll be all right.
759558 762049 He’s quite clever, you know,<br />for a human being.
778000 780200 <i>Luke.</i>
782000 783500 <i>Luke.</i>
790700 792200 Ben?
792401 796691 - <i>You will go to the Dagobah system.</i><br />- Dagobah system?
797362 799862 <i>There you will learn from Yoda...</i>
800365 803565 <i>...the Jedi master who instructed me.</i>
805236 807467 Ben! Ben!
812812 815612 Luke! Luke!
822688 827626 Don’t do this, Luke.<br />Come on, give me a sign here.
849548 854381 - Not much time.<br />- Ben... Ben...
858990 860990 Hang on, kid.
861693 864051 - Dagobah system.<br />- Whew!
864629 869157 - This may smell bad, kid...<br />- Yoda.
869535 873301 ...but it’ll keep you warm<br />until I get the shelter built.
879843 883243 I thought they smelled bad on the outside!
926891 931588 Echo Base, I’ve got something.<br />Not much, but it could be a life form.
936134 939971 Commander Skywalker, do you copy?<br />This is Rogue Two.
940739 946237 This is Rogue Two.<br />Captain Solo, do you copy?
952050 957423 Commander Skywalker, do you copy?<br />This is Rogue Two.
957523 961424 <i>Good morning!<br />Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>
961693 967295 Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.<br />I’ve found them. Repeat, I’ve found them.
997929 1001226 Master Luke, sir, it’s so good<br />to see you fully functional again.
1002301 1003636 R2 expresses his relief also.
1003736 1006934 How ya feelin’, kid?<br />You don’t look so bad to me.
1007806 1010441 In fact, you look strong enough<br />to pull the ears off a gundark.
1010909 1014639 - Thanks to you.<br />- That’s two you owe me, junior.
1015313 1017701 Well, Your Worship, looks like<br />you managed to keep me around
1017725 1019249 for a little while longer.
1019618 1022755 I had nothing to do with it.<br />General Rieekan thinks it’s dangerous...
1022855 1025888 ...for any ships to leave the system<br />until we’ve activated the energy field.
1026357 1028761 That’s a good story.<br />I think you just can’t bear...
1028861 1031523 ...to let a gorgeous guy like me<br />out of your sight.
1032297 1034930 I don’t know where you get<br />your delusions, laser brain.
1038603 1040603 Laugh it up, fuzzball...
1040905 1043441 ...but you didn’t see us alone<br />in the south passage.
1044109 1047443 - She expressed her true feelings for me.<br />- My...
1047813 1050505 Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...
1051182 1053382 ...scruffy-looking nerf herder!
1054852 1056852 Who’s scruffy-looking?
1059791 1063291 I must have hit pretty close to the mark to<br />get her all riled up like that, huh, kid?
1066732 1070024 Well, I guess you don’t know<br />everything about women yet.
1076040 1078441 <i>Headquarters personnel,<br />report to command center.</i>
1081446 1084477 <i>Headquarters personnel,<br />report to command center.</i>
1084750 1088051 - Take it easy.<br />- Excuse us, please.
1091423 1093623 Princess, we have a visitor.
1094458 1097229 We’ve picked up something outside<br />the base’s Zone 12, moving east.
1097329 1099529 - It’s metal. - Then it couldn’t<br />be one of those creatures.
1099553 1103426 - Could be a speeder, one of ours.<br />- No... wait.
1103902 1106164 There’s something<br />very weak coming through.
1109475 1112578 Sir, I’m fluent in six million<br />forms of communication.
1112678 1117607 This signal is not used by the Alliance.<br />It could be an Imperial code.
1121853 1124199 It isn’t friendly, whatever it is.<br />Come on, Chewie, let’s check it out.
1124223 1126723 Send Rogues 10 and 11 to Station 38.
1163200 1165364 - <i>Afraid there’s not much left.</i><br />- What was it?
1165464 1168933 <i>Droid of some kind. I didn’t hit it<br />that hard. Must’ve had a self-destruct.</i>
1169201 1173895 - An Imperial probe droid. - <i>It’s a<br />good bet the Empire knows we’re here.</i>
1174172 1176472 We’d better start the evacuation.
1221352 1223654 - Admiral.<br />- Yes, Captain?
1225522 1228393 I think we’ve got something, sir.<br />The report is only a fragment...
1228493 1231372 ...from a probe droid in the Hoth system,<br />but it’s the best lead we’ve had.
1231396 1235459 We have thousands of probe droids searching<br />the galaxy. I want proof, not leads.
1235834 1238468 - The visuals indicate life readings.<br />- It could mean anything.
1238737 1241137 - If we followed up every lead-<br />- But sir, the Hoth system...
1241200 1244243 - ...is supposed to be devoid of<br />human forms. - You’ve found something?
1244343 1246343 Yes, my lord.
1248079 1250945 That’s it.<br />The rebels are there.
1251315 1254809 My lord, there are so many<br />uncharted settlements.
1255186 1257689 - It could be smugglers, it could be-<br />- That is the system.
1257789 1263095 And I’m sure Skywalker is with them.<br />Set your course for the Hoth system.
1263195 1267130 - General Veers, prepare your men.<br />- Admiral.
1274039 1276240 Groups 7 and 10 will stay behind<br />to fly the speeders.
1276641 1277971 As soon as each transport is loaded,
1277995 1280321 evacuation control will give<br />clearance for immediate launch.
1280345 1281945 Right, sir.
1284816 1287476 All right! That’s it.<br />Try it.
1289488 1292416 Oh! Turn it off!<br />Turn it off! Off!
1292925 1294686 Turn it off!
1295360 1298430 Sir, it will take quite a while<br />to evacuate the T-47s.
1298530 1300408 Well, forget the heavy equipment.<br />There’s plenty of time...
1300432 1302009 ...to get the smaller modules<br />on the transports.
1302033 1304333 - Take care, sir.<br />- Thanks.
1307739 1310739 Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
1314446 1316246 Okay, okay!
1317716 1319117 Hi, kid.
1319217 1321800 There’s got to be a reason for it.<br />Check it at the other end.
1322187 1323987 Wait a second.
1324922 1327022 - You all right?<br />- Yeah.
1333798 1335701 Be careful.
1335801 1337564 You too.
1343874 1348090 General, there’s a fleet of Star Destroyers<br />coming out of hyperspace in Sector Four.
1348190 1351350 Reroute all power to the energy shield.
1351450 1354390 We’ve got to hold them until<br />all transports are away.
1354490 1356543 Prepare for ground assault.
1370235 1373664 - What is it, General? - My lord, the<br />fleet has moved out of light speed.
1374139 1377710 ComScan has detected an energy field<br />protecting an area of the sixth planet...
1377810 1381146 ...of the Hoth system. The field is strong<br />enough to deflect any bombardment.
1381246 1383815 The rebels are alerted to our presence.
1383915 1386950 Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed<br />too close to the system.
1387418 1391545 - He... He felt surprise was wiser.<br />- He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
1391923 1396516 - General, prepare your troops<br />for a surface attack. - Yes, my lord.
1404135 1407467 <i>Lord Vader. The fleet has moved out of<br />light speed, and we’re preparing to-</i>
1409274 1412971 You have failed me<br />for the last time, Admiral.
1413544 1415947 - Captain Piett.<br />- <i>Yes, my lord?</i>
1416047 1419073 Make ready to land our troops<br />beyond their energy field...
1419351 1422143 ...and deploy the fleet so that<br />nothing gets off the system.
1422420 1426990 - You are in command now, Admiral Piett.<br />- <i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>
1429027 1431921 All troop carriers will assemble<br />at the north entrance.
1432397 1434966 The heavy transport ships will leave<br />as soon as they’re loaded.
1435066 1437266 Only two fighter escorts per ship.
1437435 1440135 The energy shield can only be opened<br />for a short time...
1440371 1442571 ...so you’ll have to stay very close<br />to your transports.
1442907 1444941 Two fighters against a Star Destroyer?
1445210 1447112 The ion cannon will fire several shots...
1447212 1450538 ...to make sure that any enemy ships<br />will be out of your flight path.
1450915 1454920 When you’ve gotten past the energy shield,<br />proceed directly to the rendezvous point.
1455020 1457050 - Understood?<br />- Yeah.
1457221 1461253 - Good luck. - Okay. Everybody<br />to your stations. Let’s go!
1478743 1483440 Their primary target will be the<br />power generators. Prepare to open shield.
1489521 1493649 - Sir, rebel ships are coming into our<br />sector. - Good. Our first catch of the day.
1495760 1497760 Stand by, ion control.
1499097 1500597 Fire.
1514612 1517700 <i>The first transport is away.</i>
1517800 1521652 <i>The first transport is away.</i>
1527759 1531190 - Feeling all right, sir?<br />- Just like new, Dak. How about you?
1531363 1534357 Right now I feel I could take on<br />the whole Empire myself.
1534732 1536932 I know what you mean.
1555220 1557917 Echo Station Three-T-Eight.<br />We’ve spotted Imperial walkers.
1558489 1560789 <i>Imperial walkers on the north ridge.</i>
1583081 1585381 Echo Station Five-Seven.<br />We’re on our way.
1590622 1592647 All right, boys, keep tight now.
1593024 1596483 - Luke, I have no approach<br />vector. I’m not set. - Steady, Dak.
1596761 1598861 Attack pattern Delta.<br />Go now.
1602500 1604500 All right.<br />I’m coming in.
1608673 1610673 Hobbie, you still with me?
1632700 1635763 That armor’s too strong for blasters.
1637035 1639336 Rogue Group,<br />use your harpoons and tow cables.
1639436 1642636 Go for the legs. It might be<br />our only chance of stopping them.
1643700 1645101 All right.<br />Stand by, Dak.
1645201 1650000 Oh, Luke, we’ve got a malfunction in fire<br />control. I’ll have to cut in the auxiliary.
1650281 1654845 Just hang on. Hang on, Dak.<br />Get ready to fire that tow cable.
1660525 1662425 Dak? Dak!
1685816 1688385 Yes, Lord Vader, I’ve reached<br />the main power generators.
1688686 1692684 The shield will be down in moments.<br />You may start your landing.
1696827 1698956 - Rogue Three.<br />- Copy, Rogue Leader.
1699330 1704163 <i>Wedge, I’ve lost my gunner. You’ll<br />have to make this shot. I’ll cover for you.</i>
1704435 1707727 Set your harpoon.<br />Follow me on the next pass.
1708006 1710006 Coming around, Rogue Leader.
1712910 1715010 Steady, Rogue Two.
1715380 1717280 Activate harpoon.
1719317 1721217 Good shot, Janson.
1726958 1729158 - One more pass.<br />- Coming around, Wedge.
1735132 1737132 Cable out.<br />Let her go!
1737335 1738870 Detach cable.
1738970 1740770 Cable detached.
1748479 1749979 Come on.
1756554 1759987 - Hah! That got him!<br />- I see it, Wedge. Good work.
1760391 1762727 I don’t think we can protect<br />two transports at a time.
1762827 1767400 It’s risky, but we can’t hold out<br />much longer. We have no choice.
1767699 1770400 - Launch patrol.<br />- Evacuate remaining ground staff.
1772568 1774538 No, no! No.
1775206 1778803 This one goes there.<br />That one goes there, right?
1779277 1782813 R2, you take good care<br />of Master Luke now, understand?
1784650 1786347 And do take good care of yourself.
1790300 1792000 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
1815746 1820311 All troops will debark for ground assault.<br />Prepare to target the main generator.
1823922 1827457 - Rogue Two, are you all right?<br />- Yeah. I’m with you, Rogue Leader.
1827925 1830125 We’ll set harpoon.<br />I’ll cover for you.
1831529 1835230 - Coming around.<br />- Watch that cross fire, boys.
1835600 1838566 Set for position three.<br />Steady.
1838936 1840736 Stay tight and low.
1847078 1849903 Hobbie!<br />I’ve been hit!
1892700 1895600 - You all right?<br />- Why are you still here?
1895760 1898861 - Heard the command center had been hit.<br />- You’ve got your clearance to leave.
1898961 1902200 Don’t worry, I’ll leave. First I’m gonna<br />get you to your ship.
1902300 1905200 Your Highness, we must take<br />this last transport. It’s our only hope.
1905336 1908432 Send all troops in Sector 12 to the<br />south slope to protect the fighters.
1910441 1913509 <i>Imperial troops have entered the base.<br />Imperial troops have entered-</i>
1913978 1917807 - Come on. That’s it.<br />- Give the evacuation code signal.
1920418 1923618 - And get to your transports!<br />- Oh! Wait for me!
1923955 1927179 Begin retreat!<br />Fall back! Fall back!
1986083 1989117 - Distance to power generators?<br />- <i>17.28.</i>
1998596 2000696 Target.<br />Maximum firepower.
2026790 2028491 Transport, this is Solo.
2028591 2031391 Better take off. I can’t get to you.<br />I’ll get her out on the <i>Falcon</i>.
2032930 2035824 B-B-But where are you going?<br />Come back!
2054384 2057400 Wait! Wait for me!<br />Wait! Stop!
2058221 2059921 - How typical!<br />- Come on.
2063561 2066464 Hurry up, Goldenrod. You’re gonna be<br />a permanent resident.
2066564 2068464 Wait! Wait!
2086684 2089454 - How’s this?<br />- Would it help if I got out and pushed?
2089554 2091820 - Captain Solo! Captain Solo!<br />- It might.
2093357 2095787 Sir, might I suggest that you-
2097000 2098800 It can wait.
2101966 2104406 This bucket of bolts is never gonna<br />get us past that blockade.
2104435 2106835 This baby’s got a few surprises<br />left in her, sweetheart.
2115846 2119946 Come on! Come on! Switch over.<br />Let’s hope we don’t have a burnout.
2122753 2124654 - See?<br />- Someday you’re gonna be wrong...
2124754 2126754 ...and I just hope I’m there to see it.
2128826 2130526 Punch it!
2147911 2149511 R2!
2150412 2153112 Get her ready for takeoff.
2153983 2156986 Good luck, Luke.<br />See you at the rendezvous.
2160356 2162756 Don’t worry, R2.<br />We’re going. We’re going.
2175572 2177072 There’s nothing wrong, R2.
2177341 2179341 I’m just setting a new course.
2181979 2184479 We’re not gonna regroup with the others.
2184909 2187409 We’re going to the Dagobah system.
2188645 2190345 Yes, R2.
2192800 2195982 That’s all right. I’d like to keep it<br />on manual control for a while.
2213043 2215346 - I saw ’em! I saw ’em!<br />- Saw what?
2215446 2217548 Star destroyers,<br />two of ’em coming right at us.
2217648 2221648 - Sir! Sir! Might I suggest-<br />- Shut him up or shut him down!
2222200 2224819 Check the deflector shield.
2226123 2228216 Great. Well, we can still outmaneuver them.
2232696 2234696 Take evasive action!
2246310 2248877 - Prepare to make the jump to light speed.<br />- But sir!
2249700 2253810 - They’re getting closer.<br />- Oh, yeah? Watch this.
2257187 2258887 Watch what?
2260357 2261345 I think we’re in trouble.
2261369 2263197 If I may say so, sir,<br />I noticed earlier
2263261 2266793 the hyperdrive motivator has been damaged.<br />It’s impossible to go to light speed.
2267264 2269164 We’re in trouble.
2272970 2274970 Horizontal boosters!
2276173 2278173 Alluvial dampers.
2279611 2283638 Ow! That’s not it.<br />Bring me the hydrospanners!
2287100 2289519 I don’t know how we’re gonna<br />get out of this one.
2291822 2293783 Ow! Chewie!
2298128 2299900 That wasn’t a laser blast.<br />Something hit us.
2300000 2301900 Han, get up here!
2303200 2304800 Come on, Chewie!
2305300 2308300 - Asteroids.<br />- Oh, no.
2310140 2312840 - Chewie, set two-seven-one.<br />- What are you doing?
2314377 2316775 You’re not actually<br />going into an asteroid field!
2316799 2319247 They’d be crazy to<br />follow us, wouldn’t they?
2321952 2323355 You don’t have to<br />do this to impress me.
2323379 2325363 Sir, the possibility of<br />successfully navigating
2325387 2327446 an asteroid field is approximately
2327470 2329988 - 3,720 to 1.<br />- Never tell me the odds!
2352700 2354400 Look! Oh!
2357987 2359862 You said you wanted to be<br />around when I made a mistake.
2359886 2361132 Well, this could be it, sweetheart.
2361156 2365830 I take it back. We’re going to get<br />pulverized if we stay out here much longer.
2365930 2368731 - Ain’t gonna argue with that.<br />- Pulverized?
2368831 2370944 - I’m going in closer to one<br />of the big ones. - Closer?!
2370968 2372768 Closer?!
2399263 2402956 - Oh, this is suicide!<br />- There. That looks pretty good.
2403533 2407236 - What looks pretty good?<br />- Yeah, that’ll do nicely.
2407504 2410432 Excuse me, ma’am,<br />but where are we going?
2420851 2424146 - I hope you know what you’re doing.<br />- Yeah, me too.
2432797 2435231 Yep, that’s it. Dagobah.
2438000 2439899 No, I’m not gonna<br />change my mind about this.
2441000 2443600 I’m not picking up any<br />cities or technology.
2444000 2448603 Massive life-form readings, though.<br />There’s something alive down there.
2450600 2453149 Yes. I’m sure it’s<br />perfectly safe for droids.
2460990 2465286 I know! I know! All the scopes<br />are dead. I can’t see a thing.
2465662 2468527 Just hang on. I’m gonna start<br />the landing cycle.
2522653 2525317 No, R2, you stay put.<br />I’ll have a look around.
2529960 2533061 R2? R2!
2535265 2537565 Where are you?
2539870 2541470 R2!
2548478 2550678 You be more careful.
2552883 2555383 R2, that way.
2583547 2585147 R2!
2612443 2614043 Oh, no.
2615111 2617346 Are you all right?<br />Come on.
2620651 2622781 You’re lucky you don’t taste very good.
2624153 2626053 Anything broken?
2628925 2632795 If you’re saying coming here was a<br />bad idea, I’m beginning to agree with you.
2634065 2636690 R2, what are we doing here?
2636900 2642229 It’s like... something out of a dream or...
2642506 2646107 I don’t know.<br />Maybe I’m just going crazy.
2678941 2681537 - Yes, Admiral?<br />- Our ships have sighted
2681637 2683085 the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>, lord, but
2683109 2685516 it has entered an asteroid<br />field, and we cannot risk-
2685616 2691283 Asteroids do not concern me, Admiral.<br />I want that ship, not excuses.
2692055 2693755 Yes, lord.
2698594 2701665 I’m gonna shut down everything<br />but the emergency power systems.
2701765 2705702 Sir, I’m almost afraid to ask, but...<br />does that include shutting me down, too?
2705802 2709799 No. I need you to talk to the <i>Falcon</i>.<br />Find out what’s wrong with the hyperdrive.
2718081 2721381 Sir, it’s quite possible<br />this asteroid is not entirely stable.
2721685 2725585 Not entirely stable? I’m glad you’re here<br />to tell us these things.
2725789 2729189 Chewie, take the professor in the back<br />and plug him into the hyperdrive.
2729726 2731961 Sometimes I just don’t<br />understand human behavior.
2732329 2734449 After all, I’m only trying<br />to do my job in the most...
2739636 2741436 - Let go.<br />- Shh!
2742673 2745138 - Let go, please.<br />- Don’t get excited.
2745409 2749008 Captain, being held by you isn’t<br />quite enough to get me excited.
2749379 2753414 Sorry, sweetheart. I haven’t got time<br />for anything else.
2789000 2792020 What? Ready for some power?<br />Okay.
2795525 2799454 Let’s see now. Put that in there.<br />There you go.
2802598 2806759 Now all I gotta do is find this Yoda...<br />if he even exists.
2813243 2817073 It’s really a strange place<br />to find a Jedi master.
2817847 2820047 This place gives me the creeps.
2823486 2825086 Still...
2826556 2828756 ...there’s something<br />familiar about this place.
2830494 2832989 I don’t know.<br />I feel like...
2833163 2837026 - Feel like what?<br />- Like we’re being watched!
2837400 2841061 Away put your weapon!<br />I mean you no harm.
2841338 2844073 I am wondering...<br />why are you here?
2845641 2848645 - I’m looking for someone.<br />- Looking?
2848745 2851543 Found someone you have,<br />I would say, hmmm?
2853000 2854600 Right.
2855384 2858300 Help you I can.<br />Yes, mmmm.
2858721 2862693 I don’t think so.<br />I’m looking for a great warrior.
2862793 2865992 Ah!<br />A great warrior.
2868865 2871165 Wars not make one great.
2879876 2883268 Put that down, now we-<br />Hey! That’s my dinner!
2886583 2889286 How you get so big<br />eating food of this kind?
2889386 2891494 Listen, friend, we didn’t<br />mean to land in that puddle,
2891518 2893266 and if we could get<br />our ship out, we would.
2893357 2896458 - But we can’t, so why don’t you just-<br />- Ah, cannot get your ship out.
2896726 2899326 - Hey, get out of there!<br />- Ah!
2899596 2903897 - No! Aww...<br />- Hey, you could have broken this.
2905400 2907200 Don’t do that.
2907905 2909463 Oh!
2916613 2918813 You’re making a mess.
2920417 2924913 - Hey, give me that!<br />- Mine, or I will help you not.
2925288 2927201 I don’t want your help.<br />I want my lamp back.
2927301 2929501 I’m gonna need it<br />to get out of this slimy mudhole.
2929601 2932963 Mudhole? Slimy?<br />My home this is!
2933063 2935754 Wha... Mmm!
2936132 2938332 R2, let him have it.
2940103 2942903 - Mine! Mine! Mine! Mine!<br />- R2!
2946609 2949679 Now, will you move along, little fellow?<br />We’ve got a lot of work to do.
2949779 2954484 No! No, no! Stay and help you I will...<br />find your friend. Hmm?
2955351 2958251 I’m not looking for a friend.<br />I’m looking for a Jedi master.
2958622 2962622 Oh. Jedi master. Yoda.
2962793 2965455 - You seek Yoda.<br />- You know him?
2965729 2968965 Mmmm.<br />Take you to him I will.
2970532 2973662 Yes, yes, but now we must eat. Come.
2974737 2976871 Good food.<br />Come.
2986283 2988083 Come, come.
2989919 2994054 R2... stay and watch after the camp.
3007504 3009800 Oh! Where is R2 when I need him?
3010073 3012943 Sir, I don’t know where your ship<br />learned to communicate, but
3013043 3014498 it has the most peculiar dialect.
3014522 3016847 I believe, sir, it says<br />that the power coupling
3016947 3020973 on the negative axis has been polarized.<br />I’m afraid you’ll have to replace it.
3022051 3024651 Well, of course I’ll have to replace it.
3025388 3027388 Here... and Chewie?
3029459 3032087 I think we’d better replace<br />the negative power coupling.
3054383 3057120 Hey, Your Worship, I’m only trying to help.
3057220 3061783 - Would you please stop calling me that?<br />- Sure, Leia.
3062058 3065962 - You make it so difficult sometimes.<br />- I do. I really do.
3066429 3068932 You could be a little nicer, though.
3069032 3071933 Come on, admit it.<br />Sometimes you think I’m all right.
3073803 3075937 Occasionally... maybe...
3076206 3078600 ...when you aren’t acting like a scoundrel.
3078875 3082068 Scoundrel? Scoundrel?
3084481 3086941 I like the sound of that.
3087217 3089747 - Stop that.<br />- Stop what?
3090020 3091913 Stop that.<br />My hands are dirty.
3092188 3094422 My hands are dirty, too.<br />What are you afraid of?
3094591 3097461 - Afraid?<br />- You’re trembling.
3097561 3099961 I’m not trembling.
3101000 3105859 You like me because I’m a scoundrel. There<br />aren’t enough scoundrels in your life.
3106136 3109527 - I happen to like nice men.<br />- I’m nice men.
3109906 3111906 No, you’re not. You’re-
3114200 3117841 Sir, sir! I’ve isolated<br />the reverse power flux coupling!
3120250 3122753 Thank you.<br />Thank you very much.
3122853 3125053 Oh, you’re perfectly welcome, sir.
3130893 3133963 <i>And that, Lord Vader, was the last time<br />they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>
3134063 3136976 <i>Considering the amount of damage we’ve<br />sustained, they must have been destroyed.</i>
3137000 3139764 No, Captain.<br />They’re alive.
3140536 3144802 I want every ship available to sweep<br />the asteroid field until they are found.
3149245 3151145 Lord Vader.
3151346 3153586 - Yes, Admiral. What is it?<br />- The Emperor commands you...
3153651 3155152 ...to make contact with him.
3155252 3159889 Move the ship out of the asteroid field<br />so that we can send a clear transmission.
3159989 3161889 Yes, my lord.
3178041 3180635 What is thy bidding, my master?
3181844 3184836 <i>There is a great disturbance in the Force.</i>
3185514 3189283 - I have felt it.<br />- <i>We have a new enemy...</i>
3189752 3191752 <i>...Luke Skywalker.</i>
3192088 3195650 - Yes, my master.<br />- <i>He could destroy us.</i>
3196325 3200822 He’s just a boy. Obi-Wan<br />can no longer help him.
3201697 3206198 <i>The Force is strong with him.<br />The son of Skywalker...</i>
3206298 3209101 <i>...must not become a Jedi.</i>
3209672 3214139 If he could be turned, he would<br />become a powerful ally.
3214410 3217606 <i>Yes. Yes.</i>
3218680 3222680 <i>He would be a great asset.<br />Can it be done?</i>
3223152 3226188 He will join us or die, master.
3244040 3247877 Look, I’m sure it’s delicious. I just don’t<br />understand why we can’t see Yoda now.
3247977 3252277 Patience! For the Jedi,<br />it is time to eat as well.
3255084 3257854 Eat, eat.
3257954 3259454 Hot!
3267096 3269000 Good food!<br />Mmm, good, hmm?
3269231 3271925 How far away is Yoda?<br />Will it take us long to get there?
3272201 3277034 Not far. Yoda not far.<br />Patience. Soon you will be with him.
3279675 3282576 Root leaf.<br />I cook.
3284200 3287082 Why wish you become Jedi? Hmm?
3287950 3293122 - Mostly because of my father, I guess.<br />- Ah, father. Powerful Jedi was he.
3293222 3297222 - Hee hee. Mmm, powerful Jedi.<br />- Oh, come on.
3297593 3300296 How could you know my father?<br />You don’t even know who I am.
3300396 3304195 I don’t even know what I’m doing here.<br />We’re wasting our time!
3305568 3309637 I cannot teach him.<br />The boy has no patience.
3310006 3312368 <i>He will learn patience.</i>
3312642 3314242 Hmm...
3317313 3321616 Much anger in him...<br />like his father.
3321984 3325450 <i>Was I any different<br />when you taught me?</i>
3326823 3330560 No. He is not ready.
3330660 3332260 Yoda.
3335363 3338463 I am ready. I... Ben...<br />I can be a Jedi.
3338700 3341469 - Ben, tell him I’m read-<br />- Ready, are you?
3341637 3343869 What know you ready?
3344340 3347341 For 800 years have I trained Jedi.
3348010 3352913 My own counsel will I keep<br />on who is to be trained.
3353882 3357646 A Jedi must have<br />the deepest commitment, hmm?
3357920 3360120 The most serious mind.
3361470 3365070 This one a long time have I watched.
3365728 3368554 All his life has he looked away...
3368931 3371725 ...to the future, to the horizon.
3372201 3376572 Never his mind on where he was... hmm?
3376672 3380300 What he was doing.<br />Hmph!
3380676 3384145 Adventure. Heh!<br />Excitement. Heh!
3384713 3389612 A Jedi craves not these things.<br />You are reckless!
3389985 3392677 <i>So was I, if you remember.</i>
3393255 3398488 He is too old. Yes, too old to<br />begin the training.
3399561 3402061 But I’ve learned so much.
3409000 3412167 - Will he finish what he begins?<br />- I won’t fail you.
3414176 3416276 I’m not afraid.
3416913 3418513 Oh...
3419715 3421649 You will be.
3423152 3425145 You will be.
3467344 3470915 - Sir, if I may venture an opinion- - I’m<br />not really interested in your opinion, 3PO.
3471015 3473316 There’s something out there.
3473416 3475416 - Where?<br />- Outside, in the cave.
3476717 3478422 There it is. Listen. Listen!
3478522 3480412 - I’m going out there.<br />- Are you crazy?
3480512 3483813 I just got this bucket back together. I’m<br />not going to let something tear it apart.
3483913 3486113 Then I’m going with you.
3486363 3489363 I think it might be better<br />if I stay behind and guard the ship.
3489864 3491464 Oh, no.
3505448 3508613 This ground sure feels strange.
3509285 3512385 It doesn’t feel like rock.
3516000 3519996 - There’s an awful lot of moisture in here.<br />- I don’t know.
3520096 3524359 - I have a bad feeling about this.<br />- Yeah.
3525559 3527159 Watch out!
3527600 3529998 It’s all right.<br />It’s all right.
3530098 3532607 Yeah, that’s what I thought... mynock.
3532975 3536200 Chewie, check the rest of the ship<br />and make sure there are no more attached.
3536300 3539800 - Chewing on the power cables.<br />- Mynocks?
3539983 3542947 Go on inside. We’ll clean them off<br />if there are any more.
3550300 3553700 Aagghh! Go away, go away,<br />beastly thing! Shoo! Shoo!
3560837 3562937 Wait a minute...
3584636 3587205 - All right, Chewie! Let’s get out of here!<br />- The Empire is still out there!
3587229 3591000 - I don’t think it’s wise to-<br />- No time to discuss this in committee!
3591100 3593300 I am not a committee!
3598808 3601311 You can’t make the jump to light speed<br />in this asteroid field.
3601411 3603911 Sit down, sweetheart!<br />We’re taking off!
3608585 3610454 - Look!<br />- I see it. I see it.
3610554 3612856 - We’re doomed!<br />- The cave is collapsing.
3612956 3615490 - This is no cave.<br />- What?
3647524 3649024 Run!
3649425 3653293 Yes! A Jedi’s strength<br />flows from the Force.
3653663 3655499 But beware of the dark side.
3655599 3659601 Anger, fear, aggression.<br />The dark side of the Force are they.
3659701 3663200 Easily they flow,<br />quick to join you in a fight.
3663300 3667900 If once you start down the dark path,<br />forever will it dominate your destiny.
3668000 3671714 Consume you it will,<br />as it did Obi-Wan’s apprentice.
3672115 3673715 Vader.
3674017 3677754 - Is the dark side stronger?<br />- No, no.
3677854 3681756 No. Quicker, easier, more seductive.
3682024 3684194 But how am I to know the good side<br />from the bad?
3684294 3687831 You will know when you are calm...
3687931 3689733 ...at peace...
3689833 3691833 ...passive.
3692168 3694704 A Jedi uses the Force...
3694804 3698580 ...for knowledge and defense...<br />never for attack.
3698680 3702145 - But tell me why I can’t-<br />- No, no. There is no why.
3702245 3705281 Nothing more will I teach you today.
3705381 3707906 Clear your mind of questions.
3708484 3710284 Hmm...
3711221 3713021 Mmm...
3730039 3732839 There’s something not right here.
3736145 3739000 I feel cold...<br />death.
3739182 3744500 That place is strong with<br />the dark side of the Force.
3744654 3747352 A domain of evil it is.
3748325 3750724 In you must go.
3751200 3753600 What’s in there?
3754931 3757931 Only what you take with you.
3761437 3765237 Your weapons...<br />you will not need them.
3913290 3914790 Hmph.
3924901 3927202 Bounty hunters. We don’t need their scum.
3927302 3931130 - Yes, sir.<br />- Those rebels won’t escape us.
3936279 3940950 Sir, we have a priority signal<br />from the Star Destroyer <i>Avenger</i>.
3941050 3946750 There will be a substantial reward for<br />the one who finds the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>.
3947024 3950160 You are free to use<br />any methods necessary...
3950260 3954860 ...but I want them alive.<br />No disintegrations.
3955090 3958890 - As you wish.<br />- Lord Vader.
3959168 3961764 My lord, we have them.
3965700 3969000 Oh, thank goodness we’re coming<br />out of the asteroid field.
3973882 3976286 Let’s get out of here.<br />Ready for light speed?
3976386 3977820 One...
3977920 3979355 ...two...
3979455 3980988 ...three!
3986696 3988596 It’s not fair.
3990900 3993670 Transfer circuits aren’t working.<br />It’s not my fault!
3993770 3997136 - No light speed?<br />- It’s not my fault.
4001277 4003189 Sir, we’ve just lost<br />the main rear deflector shield.
4003213 4005782 One more direct hit<br />on the back quarter and we’re done for.
4005882 4007383 Turn her around.
4007483 4010229 I said turn her around! I’m going<br />to put all power in the front shield.
4010253 4013277 - You’re going to attack them?! - Sir,<br />the odds of surviving a direct assault...
4013301 4015101 - ...on an Imperial Star Destroyer-<br />- Shut up!
4022966 4025266 They’re moving to attack position.
4027437 4029137 Shields up.
4034576 4036746 Track them. They may come around<br />for another pass.
4036846 4039549 Captain Needa, the ship<br />no longer appears on our scopes.
4039649 4043649 They can’t have disappeared.<br />No ship that small has a cloaking device.
4043750 4045401 Well, there’s no trace of them, sir.
4045501 4048289 Captain, Lord Vader demands<br />an update on the pursuit.
4050293 4052495 Get a shuttle ready.
4052595 4056633 I shall assume full responsibility for<br />losing them, and apologize to Lord Vader.
4056733 4059933 - Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.<br />- Yes, Captain Needa.
4064474 4068474 Use the Force. Yes...
4073050 4075050 Now, the stone...
4079322 4081322 Feel it.
4092636 4094936 Concentrate!
4109585 4112455 Oh, no. We’ll never get it out now.
4112555 4114855 So certain are you.
4118194 4121688 Always with you it cannot be done.
4122766 4126800 - Hear you nothing that I say? - Master,<br />moving stones around is one thing.
4126900 4131100 - This is totally different.<br />- No! No different!
4131207 4136607 Only different in your mind.<br />You must unlearn what you have learned.
4138213 4141900 - All right. I’ll give it a try.<br />- No! Try not.
4142084 4146684 Do. Or do not.<br />There is no try.
4195337 4198204 I can’t.<br />It’s too big.
4198574 4201209 Size matters not.<br />Look at me.
4201877 4204213 Judge me by my size, do you?
4204313 4206449 Hmm? Hmph!
4206549 4209285 And well you should not...
4209385 4212022 ...for my ally is the Force.
4212122 4214322 And a powerful ally it is.
4215658 4219887 Life creates it, makes it grow.
4221130 4226630 Its energy surrounds us<br />and binds us.
4226769 4231140 Luminous beings are we,<br />not this crude matter.
4231240 4235111 You must feel the Force around you...
4235211 4238511 Here, between you, me...
4238781 4242752 ...the tree, the rock,<br />everywhere!
4242852 4244352 Yes...
4244754 4248554 ...even between the land<br />and the ship.
4253662 4255762 You want the impossible.
4363205 4366333 I don’t...<br />I don’t believe it.
4367276 4370076 That is why you fail.
4389398 4393528 Apology accepted, Captain Needa.
4401176 4404747 Lord Vader, our ships have completed<br />their scan of the area and found nothing.
4404847 4406650 If the <i>Millennium Falcon</i><br />went into light speed,
4406674 4408476 it’ll be on the other side<br />of the galaxy by now.
4408500 4412100 Alert all commands.<br />Calculate every possible destination...
4412201 4414600 ...along their last known trajectory.
4414801 4418800 - Yes, my lord. We’ll find them.<br />- Don’t fail me again...
4419260 4421255 ...Admiral.
4423300 4426667 Alert all commands.<br />Deploy the fleet.
4441317 4444117 Captain Solo, this time<br />you have gone too far!
4444987 4448057 No I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.<br />Why doesn’t anyone listen to me?
4448157 4450158 The fleet’s beginning to break up.
4450359 4453559 Go back and stand by the manual release<br />for the landing claw.
4455700 4457800 I really don’t see how<br />that is going to help.
4457900 4461250 Surrender is a perfectly acceptable<br />alternative in extreme circumstances.
4461350 4463300 The Empire may be gracious enough to-
4463501 4466100 - Thank you. - What’d you<br />have in mind for your next move?
4466200 4469177 Well, if they follow standard Imperial<br />procedure, they’ll dump their garbage...
4469201 4472101 ...before they go to light speed,<br />and then we just float away.
4472201 4474901 With the rest of the garbage...<br />Then what?
4475001 4478554 Then we gotta find a safe port<br />somewhere around here.
4478654 4480790 - Got any ideas?<br />- Well, where are we?
4480890 4484100 - Anoat system.<br />- Anoat system. There’s not much there.
4484200 4488000 No. Well, wait.<br />This is interesting.
4488100 4491167 - Lando.<br />- Lando system?
4491267 4494502 Lando’s not a system.<br />He’s a man. Lando Calrissian.
4494770 4498403 He’s this card player, gambler, scoundrel.<br />You’d like him.
4499174 4503274 - Thanks. - Bespin. It’s pretty<br />far, but I think we can make it.
4503912 4507850 - A mining colony?<br />- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.
4507950 4510100 Lando conned somebody out of it.
4510353 4513753 We go back a long way, Lando and me.
4514256 4517124 - Can you trust him?<br />- No.
4517291 4520929 But he’s got no love for the Empire,<br />I can tell you that.
4521029 4522932 Here we go, Chewie.<br />Stand by.
4523032 4524632 Detach.
4531173 4533209 You do have your moments.
4533309 4537109 Not many of them, but you do have them.
4565040 4569540 Concentrate.<br />Feel the Force flow.
4570412 4572012 Yes.
4579755 4581423 Good.
4581523 4584523 Calm. Yes.
4585060 4587930 Through the Force, things you will see.
4588030 4591701 Other places.<br />The future. The past.
4591801 4594835 Old friends long gone.
4596400 4598100 Han?
4598274 4599974 Leia!
4602845 4604514 Hmm...
4604614 4608114 Control, control.<br />You must learn control!
4611086 4614886 I saw... I saw a city in the clouds.
4615190 4618890 Hmm...<br />Friends you have there.
4619728 4623428 - They were in pain.<br />- It is the future you see.
4624967 4626667 Future?
4634510 4636710 Will they die?
4639215 4641183 Difficult to see.
4641283 4644283 Always in motion is the future.
4646400 4648800 I’ve got to go to them.
4649500 4652761 Decide you must how to serve them best.
4652861 4656200 If you leave now,<br />help them you could, but...
4656831 4661233 ...you would destroy all for which<br />they have fought and suffered.
4674216 4677153 No, I don’t have a landing permit.
4677253 4681153 I’m trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
4681556 4683132 Whoah! Wait a<br />minute! Let me explain!
4683156 4685394 <i>You will not deviate<br />from your present course.</i>
4685494 4688594 - Rather touchy, aren’t they?<br />- I thought you knew this person.
4691099 4694730 Well, that was a long time ago.<br />I’m sure he’s forgotten about that.
4702477 4706177 <i>Permission granted to land<br />on Platform 327.</i>
4706400 4708300 Thank you.
4708583 4712221 Nothing to worry about.<br />We go way back, Lando and me.
4712321 4714221 Who’s worried?
4747522 4751859 - Oh. No one to meet us.<br />- I don’t like this.
4752927 4755900 - What would you like?<br />- Well, they did let us land.
4756000 4760333 Look, don’t worry. Everything’s<br />gonna be fine. Trust me.
4764940 4767306 See? My friend.
4771346 4773646 Keep your eyes open, huh?
4776018 4777518 Hey!
4777886 4782288 Why, you slimy, double-crossing,<br />no-good swindler.
4782388 4786988 You’ve got a lot of guts coming here,<br />after what you pulled.
4797439 4801231 How you doin’, you old pirate?<br />So good to see you!
4801809 4803879 Well, he seems very friendly.
4803979 4806479 Yes.<br />Very friendly.
4807182 4810886 - What are you doing here? - Ah,<br />repairs. I thought you could help me out.
4810986 4813446 - What have you done to my ship?<br />- <i>Your</i> ship?
4813546 4817793 Hey, remember you lost her to me<br />fair and square.
4817893 4820196 And how you doin’, Chewbacca?
4820296 4822696 You still hanging around with this loser?
4825167 4827167 Hello.<br />What have we here?
4828303 4832207 Welcome, I’m Lando Calrissian.<br />I’m the administrator of this facility.
4832307 4835510 - And who might you be?<br />- Leia.
4835610 4837910 Welcome, Leia.
4839915 4843000 All right, all right, you old smoothie.
4843100 4846400 Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,<br />human-cyborg relations.
4846500 4849500 My facilities are at your...<br />Well, really!
4849600 4852250 - What’s wrong with the <i>Falcon</i>?<br />- Hyperdrive.
4852350 4854350 - I’ll get my people to work on it.<br />- Good.
4854450 4856482 You know, that ship saved<br />my life quite a few times.
4856506 4860050 She’s the fastest hunk<br />of junk in the galaxy.
4860269 4863005 How’s the gas mine?<br />It still paying off for you?
4863105 4866842 Oh, not as well as I’d like. We’re a small<br />outpost and not very self-sufficient.
4866942 4872050 And I’ve had supply problems of every kind,<br />I’ve had labor difficulties, I’ve had...
4872300 4873749 What’s so funny?
4873849 4876986 You. Listen to you.<br />You sound like a businessman...
4877086 4880400 ...a responsible leader.<br />Who’d have thought that, huh?
4880500 4883859 You know, seeing you brings back<br />a few things.
4883959 4887024 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah, I’m responsible these days.
4887995 4891131 It’s the price you pay<br />for being successful.
4893201 4895392 Oh. Nice to see a familiar face.
4896171 4897771 How rude!
4899600 4901650 That sounds like an R2 unit in there.
4901750 4905400 I wonder if...<br />Hello? Hello?
4905514 4907916 - How interesting.<br />- Who are you?
4908016 4911242 Oh, my! I... I’m terribly sorry.<br />I didn’t mean to intrude.
4911443 4913343 N-N-No, please don’t get up.
4930973 4934201 Luke, you must complete the training.
4934476 4937576 I can’t keep the vision out of my head.<br />They’re my friends. I’ve got to help them.
4937600 4941750 - You must not go.<br />- But Han and Leia will die if I don’t.
4941850 4944050 <i>You don’t know that.</i>
4945587 4948188 <i>Even Yoda cannot see their fate.</i>
4948656 4951250 But I can help them.<br />I feel the Force.
4951350 4953328 <i>But you cannot control it.</i>
4953428 4955864 <i>This is a dangerous time for you...</i>
4955964 4959435 <i>...when you will be tempted<br />by the dark side of the Force.</i>
4959535 4963000 Yes! Yes!<br />To Obi-Wan you listen.
4963171 4966865 The cave.<br />Remember your failure at the cave.
4967200 4970801 But I’ve learned so much since then.<br />Master Yoda, I promise to return...
4970901 4973447 ...and finish what I’ve begun.<br />You have my word.
4974216 4977186 <i>It is you and your abilities<br />the Emperor wants.</i>
4977286 4980186 <i>That is why your friends<br />are made to suffer.</i>
4981156 4983356 That’s why I have to go.
4983492 4987992 <i>Luke, I don’t want to lose you<br />to the Emperor the way I lost Vader.</i>
4988900 4990565 You won’t.
4990665 4994800 Stopped they must be.<br />On this all depends.
4995037 4997272 Only a fully-trained Jedi knight...
4997372 5001800 ...with the Force as his ally, will conquer<br />Vader and his Emperor.
5001977 5004271 If you end your training now...
5004295 5008300 if you choose the quick<br />and easy path, as Vader did...
5008400 5012499 - ...you will become an agent of evil.<br />- <i>Patience.</i>
5012800 5014456 And sacrifice Han and Leia?
5014556 5018727 If you honor what they fight for... yes.
5018827 5021930 <i>If you choose to face Vader,<br />you will do it alone.</i>
5022030 5024230 <i>I cannot interfere.</i>
5026034 5028034 I understand.
5032440 5034040 R2.
5034400 5036700 Fire up the converters.
5038847 5043085 <i>Luke!<br />Don’t give in to hate.</i>
5043185 5045888 <i>That leads to the dark side.</i>
5045988 5050588 Strong is Vader. Mind what you<br />have learned. Save you it can.
5051025 5055762 I will. And I’ll return.<br />I promise.
5062204 5065250 Told you, I did.<br />Reckless is he.
5065350 5068700 Now...<br />matters are worse.
5068800 5074439 - <i>That boy is our last hope.</i><br />- No, there is another.
5098340 5101450 The ship’s almost finished. Two or three<br />more things and we’re in great shape.
5101550 5103638 The sooner the better.<br />Something’s wrong here.
5103662 5105750 No one has seen or<br />knows anything about 3PO.
5105850 5108317 He’s been gone too<br />long to have gotten lost.
5108417 5112922 Relax. I’ll talk to Lando<br />and see what I can find out.
5113022 5117700 - I don’t trust Lando.<br />- Well, I don’t trust him either.
5117800 5122863 He is my friend.<br />Besides, we’ll soon be gone.
5123500 5126264 Then you’re as good as gone, aren’t you?
5160201 5162401 What happened?
5163300 5164900 Where?
5165700 5167700 Found him in a junk pile?
5167800 5171350 Oh, what a mess.<br />Chewie, you think you can repair him?
5173050 5176773 - Lando’s got people that can fix him.<br />- No thanks.
5177851 5182579 - I’m sorry, am I interrupting anything?<br />- Not really.
5185400 5187696 You look absolutely beautiful.
5187796 5191200 You truly belong here<br />with us among the clouds.
5191333 5195300 - Thank you. - Would you<br />join me for a little refreshment?
5195400 5197763 Everyone’s invited, of course.
5198974 5203701 - Having trouble with your droid?<br />- No, no problem. Why?
5211920 5215200 So you see, since we’re a small operation,<br />we don’t fall into...
5215300 5218050 ...the jurisdiction of the Empire.
5218150 5220626 - So you’re part of the Mining Guild, then?<br />- No, not actually.
5220650 5222970 Our operation is small enough<br />not to be noticed.
5223070 5227100 Which is advantageous for everybody, since<br />our customers are anxious to avoid...
5227200 5229500 ...attracting attention to themselves.
5229800 5232751 Aren’t you afraid the Empire’s going<br />to find out about this little operation?
5232775 5233750 Shut you down?
5233850 5234787 It’s always been a danger,
5234811 5236988 but it looms like a shadow<br />over everything we’ve built here.
5237012 5239481 But things have developed<br />that’ll ensure security.
5239581 5243681 I’ve just made a deal that will<br />keep the Empire out of here forever.
5253128 5256661 We would be honored if you would join us.
5262803 5265603 I had no choice. They arrived<br />right before you did.
5265907 5267707 I’m sorry.
5271313 5273374 I’m sorry, too.
5287463 5289463 No, 3PO’s with them.
5290300 5292400 Just hang on.<br />We’re almost there.
5352059 5354262 I’m terribly sorry.<br />I didn’t mean to intrude.
5354362 5356796 N-N-No, please don’t get up.
5360202 5362003 No!
5362103 5365403 Stormtroopers? Here?<br />We’re in danger!
5365750 5368650 I must tell the others.<br />Oh, no, I’ve been shot!
5395800 5397772 Lord Vader.
5397872 5402400 You may take Captain Solo to Jabba the Hutt<br />after I have Skywalker.
5402500 5404750 He’s no good to me dead.
5404850 5407850 He will not be permanently damaged.
5410051 5412855 Lord Vader, what about Leia<br />and the Wookiee?
5412955 5415700 They must never again leave this city.
5415824 5417437 That was never a<br />condition of our agreement,
5417461 5419037 nor was giving Han<br />to this bounty hunter!
5419061 5422561 Perhaps you think you’re<br />being treated unfairly?
5425633 5428200 - No.<br />- Good. It would be unfortunate...
5428300 5431264 ...if I had to leave a garrison here.
5432639 5435708 This deal is getting worse all the time.
5436511 5438514 Oh, yes, that’s very good.<br />I like that.
5438614 5440114 Oh!
5440500 5443785 Something’s not right,<br />because now I can’t see.
5443885 5447789 Oh, oh, oh, that’s much better.
5447889 5451524 Wait! Wait! Oh, my!<br />What have you done?
5451792 5454996 I’m backwards!<br />You flea-bitten furball!
5455096 5458696 Only an overgrown mophead like you<br />would be stupid enough-
5472680 5474680 I feel terrible.
5489697 5491897 Why are they doing this?
5494300 5498000 They never even asked me any questions.
5501809 5503401 Lando.
5507101 5509476 - Get out of here, Lando.<br />- Shut up and listen! Vader’s agreed...
5509500 5511800 - ...to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.<br />- Over to you...
5511900 5513765 They’ll have to stay here,<br />but at least they’ll be safe.
5513789 5516500 - What about Han?<br />- Vader’s giving him to the bounty hunter.
5516600 5518800 - Vader wants us all dead.<br />- He doesn’t want you at all.
5518900 5521300 He’s after somebody called, uh, Skywalker.
5521762 5524000 - Luke.<br />- Lord Vader set a trap for him.
5524100 5526333 - And we’re the bait!<br />- Yeah, well, he’s on his way.
5526433 5530172 Perfect... you fixed us all<br />real good, didn’t you?
5530272 5532272 My friend.
5533800 5535535 Stop!
5537345 5539179 I’ve done all I can.
5539280 5541800 I’m sorry I couldn’t do better,<br />but I’ve got my own problems.
5541900 5545000 Yeah.<br />You’re a real hero.
5555600 5558657 You certainly have a way with people.
5572700 5574649 This facility is crude...
5574749 5579849 ...but it should be adequate to freeze<br />Skywalker for his journey to the Emperor.
5580100 5582924 Lord Vader, ship approaching,<br />X-wing class.
5583024 5587024 Good. Monitor Skywalker<br />and allow him to land.
5588000 5591050 Lord Vader, we only use this facility<br />for carbon freezing.
5591150 5592982 You put him in there, it might kill him.
5593006 5595838 I do not want the<br />Emperor’s prize damaged.
5595938 5599629 We will test it...<br />on Captain Solo.
5622796 5627034 If only you’d attached my legs,<br />I wouldn’t be in this ridiculous position.
5627134 5630138 Now remember, Chewbacca,<br />you have a responsibility for me...
5630238 5632503 ...so don’t do anything foolish.
5645453 5648300 What’s going on...<br />buddy?
5648523 5650959 You’re being put into carbon freeze.
5651059 5654529 What if he doesn’t survive?<br />He’s worth a lot to me.
5654629 5658629 The Empire will compensate you<br />if he dies. Put him in.
5663671 5665605 Stop, Chewie, stop, stop!
5666600 5668650 Yes, stop, please!<br />I’m not ready to die!
5668750 5671346 Hey! Hey! Listen to me, Chewie.
5671446 5674700 Chewie, this won’t help me.<br />Hey, save your strength.
5674800 5676900 There’ll be another time.
5677719 5682018 The princess... you have to<br />take care of her.
5683800 5685700 Do you hear me? Huh?
5699500 5701275 I love you.
5701375 5703104 I know.
5731700 5735700 What’s going on? Turn around!<br />Chewbacca, I can’t see.
5793634 5796300 Oh, they’ve encased him in carbonite.
5796400 5800041 He should be quite well-protected, if<br />he survived the freezing process, that is.
5800141 5802641 Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
5802800 5807700 Yes, he’s alive.<br />And in perfect hibernation.
5808082 5810882 He’s all yours, bounty hunter.
5811052 5813677 Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
5815600 5817592 Skywalker has just landed, lord.
5817692 5821692 Good. See to it<br />that he finds his way in here.
5825600 5829671 Calrissian, take the princess<br />and the Wookiee to my ship.
5829771 5832140 You said they’d be left in the city<br />under my supervision.
5832240 5836740 I am altering the deal.<br />Pray I don’t alter it any further.
5934300 5937669 Luke! Luke, don’t,<br />it’s a trap!
5938600 5940400 It’s a trap!
5985692 5989053 The Force is with you, young Skywalker.
5990531 5993523 But you are not a Jedi yet.
6054828 6056828 Well done.
6058165 6062465 Hold them in the security tower.<br />And keep it quiet. Move.
6067775 6070600 - What do you think you’re doing?<br />- We’re getting out of here.
6070700 6072650 I knew all along.<br />It had to be a mistake.
6072750 6075799 Do you think that after what you did<br />to Han, that we’re going to trust you?
6076400 6077850 I had no choice.
6077950 6079950 What are you doing?<br />Trust him! Trust him!
6080200 6082957 We understand, don’t we, Chewie?<br />He had no choice.
6083057 6087400 - I’m just trying to help.<br />- We don’t need any of your help.
6087528 6089228 Haaa...
6090664 6092399 Ha... Ha...
6092499 6094100 - What?<br />- Han...
6094200 6099200 - It sounds like Han.<br />- There’s still a chance to save Han...
6099306 6101506 ...at the east...
6101642 6103510 ...platform.
6103610 6105210 Chewie.
6107047 6110847 I’m terribly sorry about all this.<br />After all, he’s only a Wookiee.
6111552 6114552 Put Captain Solo in the cargo hold.
6129971 6131971 R2, R2, where have you been?
6132573 6134573 Wait. Turn around, you woolly...
6135242 6138400 Hurry! Hurry! We’re trying to save Han<br />from the bounty hunter.
6140801 6143250 Well, at least you’re still in one piece.
6143350 6145550 Look what happened to me!
6157800 6160300 Oh, no! Chewie, they’re behind you!
6173247 6175600 You have learned much, young one.
6175700 6178100 You’ll find I’m full of surprises.
6189196 6192396 Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.
6193000 6195700 Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
6195800 6197567 No.
6203945 6206044 All too easy.
6210285 6213485 Perhaps you’re not as strong<br />as the Emperor thought.
6216357 6218552 Impressive.
6219661 6221761 Most impressive.
6228569 6230838 Obi-Wan has taught you well.
6230938 6233838 You have controlled your fear.
6235309 6238609 Now...<br />release your anger.
6238800 6242100 Only your hatred can destroy me.
6252800 6254457 Argh!
6372253 6376100 - The security code has been changed.<br />- R2, you can tell the computer...
6376200 6378300 ...to override the security systems.
6378592 6380692 R2, hurry!
6381062 6384750 Attention. This is Lando Calrissian.<br />The Empire has taken control of the city.
6384850 6388150 I advise everyone to leave<br />before more Imperial troops arrive.
6393740 6397100 - This way.<br />- Well, don’t blame me. I’m an interpreter.
6397200 6400300 I’m not supposed to know a power socket<br />from a computer terminal.
6421200 6426000 Ah! We’re not interested in the hyperdrive<br />on the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>. It’s fixed!
6429242 6432075 Just open the door, you stupid lump!
6440987 6444187 I never doubted you<br />for a second. Wonderful!
6466447 6468400 Ouch! Oh! Ouch that hurts!
6468500 6471000 Bend down, you thoughtless... Ow!
6476122 6477900 Leia!
6478000 6479700 Go!
6485498 6487998 I thought that hairy beast<br />would be the end of me.
6488800 6491370 Of course I’ve looked better!
6544591 6548195 You are beaten.<br />It is useless to resist.
6548295 6551295 Don’t let yourself be destroyed,<br />as Obi-Wan did.
6567300 6569549 There is no escape.
6569649 6572549 Don’t make me destroy you.
6574288 6578600 Luke... you do not yet realize<br />your importance.
6578700 6581550 You have only begun to discover your power.
6581650 6585750 Join me, and I will complete your training.
6585966 6588400 With our combined strength...
6588500 6591400 ...we can end this destructive conflict...
6591500 6593900 ...and bring order to the galaxy.
6594150 6595976 I’ll never join you!
6596076 6600576 If you only knew the power<br />of the dark side.
6600800 6605150 Obi-Wan never told you<br />what happened to your father.
6605250 6607481 He told me enough.
6609456 6611956 - He told me you killed him.<br />- No.
6612626 6615426 I am your father.
6619533 6622233 No... no...
6623403 6625403 That’s not true.
6626400 6627975 That’s impossible!
6628075 6631575 Search your feelings.<br />You know it to be true.
6632900 6634900 No!
6635600 6637600 No!
6639019 6642419 Luke. You can destroy the Emperor.
6642550 6646650 He has foreseen this.<br />It is your destiny.
6647400 6651750 Join me, and together<br />we can rule the galaxy...
6651850 6654250 ...as father and son.
6664578 6666446 Come with me.
6666546 6668946 It is the only way.
6735082 6736882 Ben.
6737317 6739417 Ben, please.
6748700 6750300 Ben.
6755302 6756902 Leia.
6766980 6769171 Hear me.
6770283 6771825 Leia.
6771925 6773625 Luke.
6775500 6777600 - We’ve got to go back.<br />- What?
6777750 6780350 - I know where Luke is.<br />- Well, what about those fighters?
6781160 6783460 - Chewie, just do it.<br />- But what about Vader?
6783661 6786297 All right, all right, all right!
6793206 6795306 Bring my shuttle.
6805851 6808251 Look, someone’s up there.
6809589 6811700 It’s Luke.<br />Chewie, slow down.
6811800 6815600 Slow down, and we’ll get under him.<br />Lando, open the top hatch.
6826973 6829373 Okay. Easy, Chewie.
6851298 6853858 - Lando?<br />- <i>Okay, let’s go.</i>
6870684 6872986 Oh, Leia.
6873086 6875086 All right, Chewie, let’s go.
6889436 6891336 I’ll be back.
6897144 6899277 Star Destroyer.
6903684 6906184 All right, Chewie.<br />Ready for light speed.
6906553 6910891 If your people fixed the hyperdrive... All<br />the coordinates are set. It’s now or never.
6910991 6912591 Punch it!
6923136 6925100 They told me they fixed it.
6925200 6929000 I trusted them to fix it!<br />It’s not my fault!
6935515 6938150 They’ll be in range<br />of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
6938250 6941650 Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive<br />on the <i>Millennium Falcon</i>?
6942189 6944000 - Yes, my lord.<br />- Good.
6944100 6948250 Prepare the boarding party,<br />and set your weapons for stun.
6948350 6950850 - Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.<br />- Yes, sir.
6952600 6955549 Noisy brute. Why don’t we just<br />go into light speed?
6955950 6957537 We can’t?
6957637 6960337 How would you know the hyperdrive<br />is deactivated?
6963338 6965600 The city’s central computer told you?
6966301 6969301 R2-D2, you know better<br />than to trust a strange computer.
6969500 6973280 Ouch! Pay attention to what you’re doing!
6983663 6986863 - Luke.<br />- Father.
6987767 6991067 Son, come with me.
6992839 6994639 Ben.
6995242 6998233 Why didn’t you tell me?
7004000 7005600 Chewie!
7015929 7017826 It’s Vader.
7022900 7026500 Luke, it is your destiny.
7031211 7032911 Ben.
7034080 7036748 Why didn’t you tell me?
7042656 7044756 Alert all commands.
7044991 7047191 Ready for the tractor beam.
7049762 7053033 R2, come back at once!<br />You haven’t finished with me yet.
7053133 7056400 You don’t know how to fix<br />the hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.
7056500 7061000 I’m standing here in pieces, and you’re<br />having delusions of grandeur!
7064300 7066438 You did it!
7123102 7126902 - Luke, we’re ready for takeoff.<br />- <i>Good luck, Lando.</i>
7127339 7131200 <i>When we find Jabba the Hutt<br />and that bounty hunter, we’ll contact you.</i>
7131644 7134144 I’ll meet you at the rendezvous point<br />on Tatooine.
7134300 7137700 Princess, we’ll find Han.<br />I promise.
7137951 7141951 Chewie, I’ll be waiting for your signal.<br />Take care, you two.
7142422 7144722 <i>May the Force be with you.</i>
7157203 7158803 Ow!
