203880 205632 Echo Three to Echo Seven.
205760 207671 Han, old buddy,<br />do you read me?
207800 209756 <i>Loud and clear, kid.<br />What's up?</i>
209880 212440 I finished my circle.<br />I don't pick up any life readings.
212560 215358 <i>There isn't enough life on this ice cube<br />to fill a space cruiser.</i>
215480 217198 <i>The sensors are placed.<br />I'm going back.</i>
217320 219117 Right. I'll see you shortly.
219240 221232 There's a meteorite<br />that hit the ground near here.
221361 223477 I want to check it out.<br />It won't take long.
223601 224590 Steady.
225961 229078 Steady, girl. What's the matter?<br />You smell something?
268562 270314 Chewie. Chewie?
276002 278197 All right.<br />Don't lose your temper.
278322 280631 I'll come right back<br />and give you a hand.
300403 301392 Solo.
301523 304162 No sign of life out there, General.<br />The sensors are in place.
304283 306956 - You'll know if anything comes around.<br />- Commander Skywalker reported in yet?
307083 309756 No. He's checking out<br />a meteorite that hit near him.
309883 313239 With all the meteor activity, it's gonna<br />be difficult to spot approaching ships.
313363 315194 General, I gotta leave.<br />I can't stay any more.
315323 318042 - I'm sorry to hear that.<br />- There's a price on my head.
318163 320393 If I don't pay off Jabba the Hutt,<br />I'm a dead man.
320523 322276 A death mark's not<br />an easy thing to live with.
323724 326192 You're a good fighter, Solo.<br />I hate to lose you.
326324 327677 Thank you, General.
335484 337361 Well, Your Highness,<br />guess this is it.
338284 339273 That's right.
342044 344319 Don't get all mushy on me.<br />So long, Princess.
347204 348353 Han.
349964 353036 - Yes, Your Highnessness.<br />- I thought you had decided to stay.
353164 355884 The bounty hunter we ran into<br />in Ord Mantell changed my mind.
356005 358155 Han, we need you.
358285 360276 - We need?<br />- Yes.
360405 362760 - What about you need?<br />- I need?
362885 365240 <i>I don't know what<br />you're talking about.</i>
365365 368721 - You probably don't.<br />- What precisely am I supposed to know?
368845 372155 Come on. You want me to stay because<br />of the way you feel about me.
372285 374753 Yes. You're a great help to us.<br />You're a natural leader.
374885 377319 No. That's not it.
377445 379003 Come on.
380245 382156 - Come on.<br />- You're imagining things.
382285 384116 Am I?<br />Then why are you following me?
384245 386361 Afraid I'd leave<br />without giving you a goodbye kiss?
386485 388953 - I'd just as soon kiss a Wookiee.<br />- I can arrange that.
389086 391122 You could use a good kiss!
392126 394720 Don't blame me. I didn't ask you<br />to turn on the thermal heater.
394846 398122 I merely commented that it was freezing<br />in the princess's chamber.
398246 399998 It's supposed to be freezing.
400126 402435 How we're going to dry<br />her clothes I really don't know.
402566 403715 Oh, switch off!
403846 406804 Why did you take this apart now?<br />I'm trying to get us out of here.
406926 408962 - Excuse me.<br />- Put them back together right now.
409086 411042 - Might I have a word?<br />- What do you want?
411166 413555 Princess Leia's been trying<br />to get you on the communicator.
413686 415756 I turned it off.<br />I don't want to talk to her.
415886 418639 Princess Leia is wondering about<br />Master Luke. He hasn't come back.
418766 420916 - She doesn't know where he is.<br />- I don't know where he is.
421046 423720 - Nobody knows where he is.<br />- What do you mean, nobody knows?
423847 425075 Deck Officer.
425207 427596 - Deck Officer.<br />- Excuse me, sir. Might I-
427727 429399 Do you know where<br />Commander Skywalker is?
429527 432087 I haven't seen him. It's possible<br />he came in the south entrance.
432207 434323 It's possible?<br />Why don't you go find out?
434447 436881 - It's getting dark out there.<br />- Yes, sir.
437007 439282 Excuse me, sir.<br />Might I enquire what's going on?
439407 441602 - Why not?<br />- Impossible man.
441727 443638 Come along, R2.<br />Let's find Princess Leia.
443767 446679 Between ourselves, I think<br />Master Luke is in considerable danger.
455927 457998 Commander Skywalker<br />hasn't come in the south entrance.
458128 460483 - Maybe he forgot to check in.<br />- Not likely. Are the speeders ready?
460608 462599 Not yet. We're having trouble<br />adapting them to the cold.
462728 465561 - We'll have to go out on tauntauns.<br />- The temperature's dropping too rapidly.
465688 467644 That's right,<br />and my friend's out in it.
472248 474603 Your tauntaun will freeze<br />before you reach the first marker.
474728 476684 Then I'll see you in hell.
608892 610689 You must come along now, R2.
610812 612768 There's really<br />nothing more we can do.
612892 614883 And my joints are freezing up.
615932 619686 Don't say things like that.<br />Of course we'll see Master Luke again.
619812 622451 And he'll be quite all right.<br />You'll see.
622572 626043 Stupid little short circuit.<br />He'll be quite all right.
681294 684013 Sir, all the patrols are in.<br />Still no-
685214 687933 Still no contact<br />from Skywalker or Solo.
688054 691967 Mistress Leia, R2 says he's been<br />quite unable to pick up any signals...
692095 695326 although he admits that his own range<br />is far too weak to abandon all hope.
695455 697491 Your Highness,<br />there's nothing more we can do tonight.
697615 699845 The shield doors must be closed.
701135 703444 - Close the doors.<br />- Yes, sir.
704895 709446 R2 says the chances<br />of survival are 725-to-1.
720575 724124 Actually, R2 has been known<br />to make mistakes...
726736 728647 from time to time.
728776 730528 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
733376 735890 Don't worry about Master Luke.<br />I'm sure he'll be all right.
736016 738689 He's quite clever, you know,<br />for a human being.
754176 755768 <i>Luke.</i>
757536 758810 Luke.
766017 767496 Ben?
767617 770131 You will go to<br />the Dagobah system.
770257 771929 Dagobah system?
772057 775367 There you will<br />learn from Yoda...
775497 779092 the Jedi master<br />who instructed me.
796818 800049 Don't do this, Luke.<br />Give me a sign here.
822818 825013 - Not much time.<br />- Ben.
831379 832334 Hang on, kid.
834419 836535 Dagobah system. Dagobah.
836659 838251 This may smell bad, kid...
839579 841410 Yoda.
841539 845817 but it'll keep you warm<br />till I get the shelter up.
845939 847895 Ben. Dagobah.
851659 853570 I thought they smelled bad...
853699 855451 on the outside.
897021 899330 Echo Base, I've got something.
899461 901292 Not much,<br />but it could be a life form.
905741 907891 Commander Skywalker,<br />do you copy?
908021 909818 This is Rogue Two.
909941 912501 This is Rogue Two.
912621 915340 Captain Solo, do you copy?
920821 924131 Commander Skywalker,<br />do you copy?
924261 926013 This is Rogue Two.
926141 929100 <i>Good morning.<br />Nice of you guys to drop by.</i>
930022 932934 Echo Base, this is Rogue Two.
933062 935530 I've found them.<br />Repeat. I've found them.
964943 968099 Master Luke, sir, it's so good<br />to see you fully functional again.
968223 970817 - Thanks, 3PO.<br />- R2 expresses his relief also.
970943 974299 How ya feelin', kid?<br />You don't look so bad to me.
974423 977176 You look strong enough<br />to pull the ears off a gundark.
977303 980932 - Thanks to you.<br />- That's two you owe me, junior.
981063 982337 Well, Your Worship...
982463 985421 looks like you managed to keep me around<br />for a little while longer.
985543 987340 I had nothing to do with it.
987463 989977 General Rieekan thinks<br />it's dangerous for any ships to leave...
990103 991934 until we've activated the energy field.
992063 993257 That's a good story.
993383 997138 I think you just can't bear to let a<br />gorgeous guy like me out of your sight.
997264 1000415 <i>I don't know where<br />you get your delusions, laser brain.</i>
1003744 1005860 Laugh it up, fuzzball...
1005984 1008942 but you didn't see us alone<br />in the south passage.
1009064 1011214 She expressed<br />her true feelings for me.
1011344 1012413 My-
1012544 1015820 Why, you stuck-up, half-witted...
1015944 1017900 scruffy-looking nerf herder!
1019144 1020941 Who's scruffy-lookin'?
1024184 1027415 I must have hit close to the mark<br />to get her riled up like that, huh, kid?
1030985 1033738 I guess you don't know<br />everything about women yet.
1039745 1042305 <i>Headquarters personnel,<br />report to command centre.</i>
1045145 1047943 <i>Headquarters personnel,<br />report to command centre.</i>
1048065 1049942 Take it easy.
1050065 1052021 Excuse us, please.
1054225 1056181 Princess, we have a visitor.
1057305 1060058 We picked up something<br />outside Zone 12 moving east.
1060185 1062336 - It's metal.<br />- It couldn't be one of those creatures.
1062466 1066095 - Could be one of our speeders.<br />- No. Wait.
1066226 1068740 There's something<br />very weak coming through.
1071946 1074858 Sir, I am fluent in six million<br />forms of communication.
1074986 1077978 This signal is not used by the Alliance.<br />It could be an imperial code.
1083746 1085702 It isn't friendly.<br />Chewie, let's check it out.
1085826 1088704 Send Rogues 10 and 11<br />to Station 38.
1123427 1125383 <i>- I'm afraid there's not much left.<br />- What was it?</i>
1125507 1127463 <i>Droid of some kind.<br />I didn't hit it that hard.</i>
1127587 1130898 <i>- Must have had a self-destruct.<br />- An imperial probe droid.</i>
1131028 1133781 <i>It's a good bet the Empire<br />knows we're here.</i>
1133908 1136028 We'd better start the evacuation.
1179189 1181578 - Admiral.<br />- Yes, Captain?
1182949 1185702 I think we've got something, sir.<br />The report is only a fragment...
1185829 1188582 from a probe droid in the Hoth system,<br />but it's the best lead we've had.
1188709 1191667 We have thousands of probe droids<br />searching the galaxy.
1191789 1194622 - I want proof, not leads.<br />- The visuals indicate life readings.
1194749 1196899 It could mean anything.<br />If we followed up every lead-
1197030 1199942 But, sir, the Hoth system is<br />supposed to be devoid of humans forms.
1200110 1202340 - You found something?<br />- Yes, my lord.
1204710 1206905 That's it.<br />The rebels are there.
1207830 1211300 My lord, there are so many<br />uncharted settlements.
1211430 1214069 - It could be smugglers-<br />- That is the system.
1214190 1216465 And I'm sure Skywalker is with them.
1216590 1219468 Set your course<br />for the Hoth system.
1219590 1221899 General Veers,<br />prepare your men.
1222030 1223304 Admiral.
1229790 1231827 Groups Seven and 10<br />will stay behind to fly the speeders.
1231951 1233703 As soon as each transport is loaded...
1233831 1235787 evacuation control<br />will give clearance for launch.
1235911 1237503 Right, sir.
1239591 1241547 All right. That's it.
1241671 1243024 Try it.
1244751 1247345 Turn it off! Turn it off!
1249671 1252902 Sir, it will take quite a while<br />to evacuate the T-47 s.
1253031 1256501 Forget the heavy equipment. There's time<br />to get small modules on the transports.
1256631 1258587 - Take care, sir.<br />- Thanks.
1261871 1264864 Chewie, take care of yourself, okay?
1268472 1270030 Okay, okay.
1271432 1272831 Hi, kid.
1272952 1275910 There's gotta be a reason for it.<br />Check it at the other end.
1276032 1277385 Wait a second.
1278432 1280741 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah.
1286712 1288782 Be careful.
1288912 1290664 You too.
1296552 1298350 General, there's<br />a fleet of Stardestroyers...
1298473 1300623 coming out of hyperspace<br />in Sector Four.
1300753 1303586 Reroute all power<br />to the energy shield.
1303713 1306671 We gotta hold them till<br />all transports are away.
1306793 1308749 Prepare for ground assault.
1322073 1325270 - What is it, General?<br />- The fleet has moved out of light speed.
1325393 1327384 ComScan has detected<br />an energy field...
1327513 1329981 protecting an area of the sixth planet<br />of the Hoth system.
1330113 1332469 The field is strong enough<br />to deflect any bombardment.
1332594 1334949 The rebels are alerted<br />to our presence.
1335074 1338032 Admiral Ozzel came out of light speed<br />too close to the system.
1338154 1340304 He felt surprise was wiser.
1340434 1342425 He is as clumsy as he is stupid.
1342554 1345990 General, prepare your troops<br />for a surface attack.
1346114 1347672 Yes, my lord.
1354274 1355423 <i>Lord Vader.</i>
1355554 1358432 <i>The fleet has moved out of light speed,<br />and we're preparing to-</i>
1359474 1363433 You have failed me<br />for the last time, Admiral.
1363554 1365830 <i>- Captain Piett.<br />- Yes, my lord?</i>
1365955 1368833 Make ready to land our troops<br />beyond their energy field...
1368955 1371788 and deploy the fleet so that<br />nothing gets off the system.
1371915 1374952 You are in command now,<br />Admiral Piett.
1375075 1376827 <i>Thank you, Lord Vader.</i>
1378355 1381313 All troop carriers will assemble<br />at the north entrance.
1381435 1383995 The heavy transport ships<br />will leave as soon as they're loaded.
1384115 1386071 Only two fighter escorts per ship.
1386195 1389153 The energy shield<br />can only be opened for a short time...
1389275 1391664 so you'll have to stay very close<br />to your transports.
1391795 1393786 Two fighters against a Stardestroyer?
1393915 1395871 The ion cannon will fire<br />several shots...
1395995 1398988 to make sure that any enemy ships<br />will be out of your flight path.
1399116 1401107 When you've gotten past<br />the energy shield...
1401236 1403192 proceed directly<br />to the rendezvous point.
1403316 1405147 Understood?
1405276 1406789 Good luck.
1406916 1409271 Everybody to your stations.<br />Let's go.
1425716 1428674 Their primary target will be<br />the power generators.
1428796 1430548 Prepare to open shield.
1436157 1438227 Sir, rebel ships are<br />coming into our sector.
1438357 1440348 Good. Our first catch of the day.
1442317 1444273 Stand by, ion control.
1445317 1446272 Fire.
1460917 1463829 <i>The first transport is away.</i>
1463957 1466597 <i>The first transport is away.</i>
1472838 1474635 Feeling all right, sir?
1474758 1476555 Just like new, Dak.<br />How about you?
1476678 1479476 Right now I feel I could take on<br />the whole Empire myself.
1479598 1481554 I know what you mean.
1499158 1502310 Echo Station 3-T8.<br />We've spotted imperial walkers.
1502439 1504794 <i>Imperial walkers<br />on the north ridge.</i>
1525999 1528194 Echo Station 57,<br />we're on our way.
1533399 1535311 All right, boys,<br />keep tight now.
1535440 1537476 Luke, I have no approach vector.<br />I'm not set.
1537600 1538999 Steady, Dak.
1539120 1540872 Attack pattern Delta.<br />Go now.
1544520 1546078 I'm coming in.
1550440 1551429 Hobbie, you still with me?
1573241 1575277 That armour's too strong for blasters.
1577641 1579711 Rogue Group,<br />use your harpoons and tow cables.
1579841 1581911 Go for the legs.<br />It might be our only chance.
1584201 1585395 Stand by, Dak.
1585521 1588194 Luke, we've got<br />a malfunction in fire control.
1588321 1590232 I'll have to cut in the auxiliary.
1590361 1592158 Just hang on.
1592281 1594954 Hang on, Dak.<br />Get ready to fire that tow cable.
1600161 1601072 Dak?
1624242 1627040 Yes, Lord Vader.<br />I've reached the main power generators.
1627162 1630120 The shield will be down in moments.<br />You may start your landing.
1634923 1636038 Rogue Three.
1636163 1637516 Copy, Rogue Leader.
1637643 1640476 <i>Wedge, I've lost my gunner.<br />You'll have to make this shot.</i>
1640603 1642241 <i>I'll cover for you.</i>
1642363 1644593 Set your harpoon.<br />Follow me on the next pass.
1645803 1647634 Coming around, Rogue Leader.
1650403 1651802 Steady, Rogue Two.
1652763 1653752 Activate harpoon.
1656643 1658076 Good shot,Janson.
1663883 1666078 One more pass.
1671444 1673594 Cable out.<br />Let her go!
1673724 1674873 Detach cable.
1675604 1676673 Cable detached.
1684244 1685802 Come on!
1693324 1695792 - That got him!<br />- I see it, Wedge. Good work.
1696324 1698280 I don't think we can protect<br />two transports at a time.
1698404 1700599 It's risky, but we can't<br />hold out much longer.
1700724 1702283 We have no choice.
1703205 1705765 - Launch patrol.<br />- Evacuate remaining ground staff.
1710445 1713835 This one goes there,<br />that one goes there. Right?
1713965 1717275 R2, you take good care<br />of Master Luke now, understand?
1719045 1721081 And do take good care of yourself.
1724645 1726078 Oh, dear. Oh, dear.
1748926 1751156 All troops will debark<br />for ground assault.
1751286 1753641 Prepare to target<br />the main generator.
1757166 1760476 - Rogue Two, are you all right?<br />- Yeah. I'm with you, Rogue Leader.
1760606 1762358 Set harpoon.<br />I'll cover for you.
1763886 1766684 - Coming around.<br />- Watch that crossfire, boys.
1768086 1769805 Set for position three.
1769927 1771155 Steady.
1771287 1773676 Stay tight and low.<br />This is it!
1779327 1780521 Hobbie!
1780647 1782046 I've been hit!
1823048 1825608 - You all right?<br />- Why are you still here?
1825728 1828606 - Heard the command centre had been hit.<br />- You've got your clearance to leave.
1828728 1832004 Don't worry. I'll leave.<br />First I'm gonna get you to your ship.
1832128 1835086 Your Highness, we must take<br />this last transport. It's our only hope.
1835208 1838167 Send all troops in Sector 12 to<br />the south slope to protect the fighters.
1839769 1841725 <i>Imperial troops<br />have entered the base.</i>
1841849 1843407 <i>Imperial troops have entered-</i>
1843529 1845326 Come on. That's it.
1845449 1847679 Give the evacuation code signal.
1849529 1851485 And get to your transports.
1851609 1852678 Wait for me.
1852809 1854208 Begin retreat!
1855249 1857001 Fall back!
1912411 1915528 - Distance to power generators?<br />- 17.28.
1924291 1926122 Target. Maximum firepower.
1951412 1953880 Transport, this is Solo.<br />Take off. I can't get to you.
1954012 1955843 <i>I'll get her out on the Falcon.<br />Come on.</i>
1958372 1960328 Where are you going?<br />Come back!
1978093 1981324 Wait! Wait for me! Stop!
1981453 1983205 - How typical.<br />- Come on.
1986973 1989771 Hurry up, goldenrod!<br />You're gonna be a permanent resident.
1989893 1991565 Wait! Wait!
2008774 2011811 - How's this?<br />- Would it help if I got out and pushed?
2011934 2014050 - Captain Solo. Captain Solo.<br />- It might.
2015294 2017854 Sir, might I suggest that you-
2017974 2019566 It can wait.
2023654 2026043 This bucket of bolts<br />will never get past that blockade.
2026174 2028130 This baby's got<br />a few surprises left in her.
2036934 2038653 Come on! Come on!
2038775 2041608 Switch over.<br />Let's hope we don't have a burnout.
2043615 2044206 See?
2044335 2046530 Someday you'll be wrong.<br />I hope I'm there to see it.
2049295 2050364 Punch it!
2067735 2068690 R2.
2070295 2072252 Get her ready for take-off.
2074456 2076526 Good luck, Luke.<br />See you at the rendezvous.
2079856 2082211 Don't worry, R2.<br />We're going. We're going.
2093856 2097292 There's nothing wrong, R2.<br />I'm just setting a new course.
2100616 2104609 We're not gonna regroup with the others.<br />We're going to the Dagobah system.
2106897 2108296 Yes, R2.
2111097 2113930 That's all right. I'd like to keep it<br />on manual control for a while.
2129977 2132252 - I saw 'em! I saw 'em!<br />- Saw what?
2132377 2134447 Stardestroyers,<br />two of'em coming right at us.
2134577 2137250 - Sir, might I suggest-<br />- Shut him up or shut him down!
2138977 2140934 Check the deflector shield.
2142898 2144854 Great. Well, we can still<br />outmanoeuvre them.
2149018 2150895 Take evasive action!
2161978 2164651 - Prepare to jump to light speed.<br />- But, sir!
2165618 2167256 They're getting closer.
2167378 2169414 Oh, yeah?<br />Watch this.
2172418 2173977 Watch what?
2175499 2177854 - I think we're in trouble.<br />- If I may say so...
2177979 2180334 I noticed earlier the hyperdrive<br />motivator has been damaged.
2180459 2183417 - It's impossible to go to light speed.<br />- We're in trouble.
2187539 2188733 Horizontal boosters!
2190859 2192770 Alluvial dampers.
2195499 2198059 That's not it.<br />Bring me the hydrospanner.
2201419 2203979 I don't know how<br />we're gonna get out of this one.
2206579 2207729 Chewie!
2211260 2213216 That wasn't a laser blast.<br />Something hit us.
2213340 2214693 Han, get up here.
2216380 2217733 Come on, Chewie!
2218540 2219495 Asteroids.
2223300 2225768 - Chewie, set 271.<br />- What are you doing?
2227220 2229336 You're not actually going<br />into an asteroid field?
2229460 2231132 They'd be crazy to follow us,<br />wouldn't they?
2234220 2236051 You don't have to do this<br />to impress me.
2236180 2239217 Sir, the possibility of successfully<br />navigating an asteroid field...
2239340 2242458 - is approximately 3,720-to-1.<br />- Never tell me the odds.
2269301 2272293 You said you wanted to be around when<br />I made a mistake. This could be it.
2272421 2273979 I take it back.
2274101 2277060 We're gonna get pulverized<br />if we stay out here much longer.
2277182 2278900 - Ain't gonna argue with that.<br />- Pulverized?
2279022 2280774 I'm going closer<br />to one of the big ones.
2280902 2282654 - Closer?<br />- Closer?
2308663 2310460 This is suicide!<br />There's nowhere to go.
2310583 2312460 There. That looks pretty good.
2312583 2314380 What looks pretty good?
2314503 2316778 Yeah. That'll do nicely.
2316903 2319622 Excuse me, ma'am,<br />but where are we going?
2329183 2331299 I hope you know<br />what you're doing.
2331423 2332776 Yeah. Me too.
2341223 2343374 Yep, that's it. Dagobah.
2345744 2347860 No, I'm not gonna change<br />my mind about this.
2348784 2351139 I'm not picking up<br />any cities or technology.
2351264 2353220 Massive life form readings though.
2354264 2356220 There's something alive down there.
2357824 2360577 Yes. I'm sure<br />it's perfectly safe for droids.
2367984 2369622 I know! I know!
2369744 2372304 All the scopes are dead.<br />I can't see a thing.
2372424 2375337 Just hang on.<br />I'm gonna start the landing cycle.
2427266 2429780 No, R2, you stay put.<br />I'll have a look around.
2434106 2435255 R2?
2439066 2440135 Where are you?
2443667 2444895 R2!
2451507 2452986 You be more careful.
2455907 2458580 R2, that way.
2485508 2486782 R2!
2513309 2514742 Oh, no.
2515949 2517905 Are you all right?<br />Come on.
2521309 2523265 You were lucky<br />to get out of there.
2524469 2526187 Anything broken?
2528829 2531787 If you're saying<br />coming here was a bad idea...
2531909 2533979 I'm beginning to agree with ya.
2534109 2536669 R2, what are we doing here?
2536789 2538142 It's like...
2539189 2541145 something out of a dream or-
2542069 2544026 I don't know.
2544150 2546106 Maybe I'm just going crazy.
2577151 2578470 Yes, Admiral?
2578591 2580582 <i>Our ships have sighted<br />the Millennium Falcon, lord...</i>
2580711 2583669 but it has entered an asteroid field,<br />and we cannot risk-
2583791 2586464 Asteroids do not<br />concern me, Admiral.
2586591 2589981 - I want that ship, not excuses.<br />- Yes, lord.
2595871 2598829 I'm gonna shut down everything<br />but the emergency power systems.
2598951 2602739 Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask, but does<br />that include shutting me down too?
2602871 2604827 <i>No. I need you<br />to talk to the Falcon...</i>
2604951 2607101 find out what's wrong<br />with the hyperdrive.
2614632 2617988 Sir, it's quite possible<br />this asteroid is not entirely stable.
2618112 2619909 Not entirely stable?
2620032 2621988 I'm glad you're here<br />to tell us these things.
2622112 2625548 Chewie, take the professor in the back<br />and plug him into the hyperdrive.
2625672 2628061 Sometimes I just don't<br />understand human behaviour.
2628192 2630422 After all, I'm only<br />trying to do my job.
2635312 2636665 Let go.
2638432 2640627 - Let go, please.<br />- Don't get excited.
2640752 2644301 Captain, being held by you<br />isn't quite enough to get me excited.
2644432 2646185 Sorry, sweetheart.
2646313 2648873 I haven't got time<br />for anything else.
2681914 2685190 Ready for some power?<br />Okay.
2689034 2690387 Let's see now.
2690514 2692709 Put that in there.<br />There you go.
2695714 2698353 Now all I gotta do<br />is find this Yoda...
2698474 2700669 if he even exists.
2705954 2708752 It's really a strange place<br />to find a Jedi master.
2710154 2711907 This place gives me the creeps.
2715675 2717028 Still...
2718275 2720186 there's something familiar<br />about this place.
2722355 2724073 I don't know.
2724195 2726151 - I feel like-<br />- Feel like what?
2727195 2728753 Like we're being watched.
2728875 2731753 Away put your weapon.<br />I mean you no harm.
2732955 2735515 I am wondering,<br />why are you here?
2737155 2740033 - I'm looking for someone.<br />- Looking?
2740155 2742669 Found someone you have,<br />I would say.
2743835 2745314 Right.
2746236 2748511 Help you I can. Yes.
2749356 2750505 I don't think so.
2752076 2754670 I'm looking for a great warrior.
2754796 2756354 Great warrior.
2759316 2761466 Wars not make one great.
2769516 2771154 Put that down.
2771276 2773107 Hey! That's my dinner.
2776316 2778910 How you get so big<br />eating food of this kind?
2779036 2781153 Listen, friend, we didn't mean<br />to land in that puddle.
2781277 2783711 If we could get our ship out, we would.<br />But we can't.
2783837 2785828 Aw, cannot get your ship out.
2785957 2787549 Get out of there.
2790677 2792872 Hey, you could have broken this.
2794437 2796393 Don't do that.
2805117 2807073 You're making a mess.
2808517 2810473 Hey, give me that.
2810597 2813032 Mine, or I will help you not.
2813158 2815069 I don't want your help.<br />I want my lamp back.
2815198 2817837 I'm gonna need it to get out of<br />this slimy mud-hole.
2817958 2819994 Mud-hole? Slimy?<br />My home this is.
2823718 2825071 R2, let him have it.
2827678 2830272 - Mine! Mine! Mine!<br />- R2.
2834038 2837269 Will you move along, little fella?<br />We got a lot of work to do.
2838318 2841390 Stay and help you I will.<br />Find your friend.
2842238 2844991 I'm not looking for a friend.<br />I'm looking for a Jedi master.
2847039 2849314 Jedi master. Yoda.
2849439 2851907 - You seek Yoda.<br />- You know him?
2853639 2855595 Take you to him I will.
2856799 2859791 Yes, yes, but now we must eat.
2859919 2862479 Come.<br />Good food. Come.
2871879 2873437 Come, come.
2875559 2876594 R2...
2877439 2879589 stay and watch after the camp.
2892600 2894556 Where is R2 when I need him?
2894680 2897240 Sir, I don't know where your ship<br />learned to communicate...
2897360 2899191 but it has the most peculiar dialect.
2899320 2902676 I believe it says the power coupling<br />on the negative axis has been polarized.
2902800 2905155 I'm afraid you'll have to replace it.
2906200 2908350 Well, of course<br />I'll have to replace it.
2909560 2911676 Here. And, Chewie...
2913280 2915841 I think we better replace<br />the negative power coupling.
2937321 2939881 Hey, Your Worship,<br />I'm only trying to help.
2940001 2942356 Would you please<br />stop calling me that?
2942481 2944358 Sure, Leia.
2944481 2947758 - You make it so difficult sometimes.<br />- I do. I really do.
2948802 2950952 You could be a little nicer though.
2951082 2953642 Admit it.<br />Sometimes you think I'm all right.
2955922 2958072 Occasionally, maybe...
2958202 2960557 when you aren't acting<br />like a scoundrel.
2960682 2962035 Scoundrel?
2965842 2967480 I like the sound of that.
2968522 2971195 - Stop that.<br />- Stop what?
2971322 2973392 Stop that.<br />My hands are dirty.
2973522 2975592 My hands are dirty too.<br />What are you afraid of?
2975722 2977758 - Afraid?<br />- You're trembling.
2978682 2980673 I'm not trembling.
2982083 2984438 You like me because I'm a scoundrel.
2984563 2986872 There aren't enough<br />scoundrels in your life.
2987003 2988959 I happen to like nice men.
2989083 2991643 - I'm a nice man.<br />- No, you're not.
2994443 2995398 Sir, sir!
2995523 2998276 I've isolated<br />the reverse power flux coupling.
3000443 3001592 Thank you.
3001723 3004556 - Thank you very much.<br />- You're perfectly welcome, sir.
3010403 3013395 <i>That, Lord Vader, was the last time<br />they appeared in any of our scopes.</i>
3013523 3016322 <i>Considering the damage we've sustained,<br />they must have been destroyed.</i>
3016444 3019595 No, Captain, they're alive.
3019724 3023876 I want every ship available to sweep<br />the asteroid field until they are found.
3028244 3031395 - Lord Vader.<br />- Yes, Admiral. What is it?
3031524 3033674 The emperor commands you<br />to make contact with him.
3033804 3035874 Move the ship out of<br />the asteroid field...
3036004 3038154 so that we can send<br />a clear transmission.
3038284 3039842 Yes, my lord.
3055765 3058199 What is thy bidding, my master?
3059445 3063324 <i>There is a great disturbance<br />in the Force.</i>
3064165 3066395 I have felt it.
3066525 3068959 <i>We have a new enemy-</i>
3069085 3072919 <i>the young rebel who destroyed<br />the Death Star.</i>
3073045 3076037 <i>I have no doubt this boy...</i>
3076165 3080363 <i>is the offspring of Anakin Skywalker.</i>
3080485 3082636 How is that possible?
3082766 3085997 <i>Search your feelings, Lord Vader.</i>
3086126 3089198 <i>You will know it to be true.</i>
3089326 3091681 <i>He could destroy us.</i>
3091806 3093797 He's just a boy.
3093926 3096281 Obi-Wan can no longer help him.
3096406 3099842 <i>The Force is strong with him.</i>
3101166 3105876 <i>The son of Skywalker<br />must not become a Jedi.</i>
3106006 3108076 If he could be turned...
3108206 3110925 he would become a powerful ally.
3111926 3113564 <i>Yes.</i>
3114406 3118480 <i>He would be a great asset.</i>
3118607 3120757 <i>Can it be done?</i>
3120887 3124675 He will join us or die, master.
3140647 3144401 I'm sure it's delicious. I just don't<br />understand why we can't see Yoda now.
3144527 3148156 Patience. For the Jedi,<br />it is time to eat as well.
3151448 3153325 Eat. Eat.
3154168 3155442 Hot.
3162888 3164765 Good food. Good.
3164888 3167686 How far away is Yoda?<br />Will it take us long to get there?
3167808 3169958 Not far. Yoda not far.
3170088 3172727 Patience.<br />Soon you will be with him.
3175048 3177608 Root leaf. I cook.
3179368 3181723 Why wish you become Jedi?
3182768 3185329 Mostly 'cause of my father, I guess.
3185449 3188407 Father.<br />Powerful Jedi was he.
3189849 3191521 - Powerful Jedi.<br />- Oh, come on.
3192369 3195008 How could you know my father?<br />You don't even know who I am.
3195129 3198485 I don't even know what I'm doing here.<br />We're wasting our time!
3199849 3202044 I cannot teach him.
3202169 3204125 The boy has no patience.
3204249 3206399 <i>He will learn patience.</i>
3211049 3213324 Much anger in him...
3213449 3215201 like his father.
3215329 3218879 <i>Was I any different<br />when you taught me?</i>
3220210 3221120 No.
3222050 3225122 - He is not ready.<br />- Yoda.
3228130 3229882 I am ready.
3230010 3232808 I can be a Jedi.<br />Ben, tell him I'm-
3232930 3236605 Ready, are you?<br />What know you ready?
3236730 3240518 For 800 years have I trained Jedi.
3240650 3244245 My own counsel will I keep<br />on who is to be trained.
3246130 3249759 AJedi must have<br />the deepest commitment...
3249890 3251643 the most serious mind.
3253571 3256529 This one a long time have I watched.
3257571 3260210 All his life<br />has he looked away...
3260331 3263243 to the future,<br />to the horizon.
3263371 3266761 Never his mind on where he was...
3268051 3270007 what he was doing.
3271651 3272606 Adventure.
3273931 3275489 Excitement.
3275611 3277761 AJedi craves not these things.
3278691 3280409 You are reckless.
3280531 3283364 <i>So was I, if you remember.</i>
3283491 3285448 He is too old.
3287372 3289442 Yes, too old to begin the training.
3289572 3291403 But I've learned so much.
3298932 3302049 - Will he finish what he begins?<br />- I won't fail you.
3303532 3305124 I'm not afraid.
3309452 3311408 You will be.
3312532 3314488 You will be.
3354854 3358210 - Sir, if I may venture an opinion-<br />- I'm not interested in your opinion.
3358334 3360245 There's something out there.
3360374 3362251 - Where?<br />- Outside in the cave.
3363894 3365327 There it is. Listen!
3365454 3367251 - I'm going out there.<br />- Are you crazy?
3367374 3369808 I just got this bucket together.<br />I won't let it get torn apart.
3369934 3371970 Then I'm going with you.
3373174 3376132 I think it might be better<br />if I stay behind and guard the ship.
3376254 3377209 Oh, no.
3391695 3393651 This ground sure feels strange.
3395215 3397171 It doesn't feel like rock.
3401495 3403963 There's an awful lot<br />of moisture in here.
3404095 3407644 I don't know.<br />I have a bad feeling about this.
3407775 3408924 Yeah.
3410935 3411811 Watch out!
3412895 3415250 It's all right. It's all right.
3415375 3417730 Yeah, that's what I thought- mynock.
3417855 3420848 Chewie, check the rest of the ship and<br />make sure there are no more attached...
3420976 3422773 chewing on the power cables.
3422896 3424409 Mynocks?
3424536 3426652 Go inside. We'll clean them off<br />if there are any more.
3435456 3437811 Go away!<br />Go away, beastly thing! Shoo!
3444816 3446568 Wait a minute.
3467417 3470693 - Chewie, let's get out of here!<br />- The Empire is still out there!
3470817 3472773 No time to discuss this<br />in committee!
3473617 3475573 I am not a committee!
3480817 3483536 You can't make the jump to light speed<br />in this asteroid field.
3483657 3486012 Sit down, sweetheart.<br />We're taking off.
3490618 3491892 - Look!<br />- I see it.
3492018 3494293 - We're doomed!<br />- The cave is collapsing.
3494418 3496215 - This is no cave.<br />- What?
3527379 3528698 Yes, run.
3528819 3530298 Yes.
3530419 3533616 AJedi's strength<br />flows from the Force.
3533739 3537015 But beware of the dark side.<br />Anger, fear, aggression-
3537139 3539209 The dark side<br />of the Force are they.
3539339 3542775 Easily they flow,<br />quick to join you in a fight.
3542899 3545015 If once you start down<br />the dark path...
3545139 3547334 <i>forever will it dominate<br />your destiny.</i>
3547459 3551247 Consume you it will,<br />as it did Obi-Wan's apprentice.
3551379 3553131 Vader.
3553259 3556218 - Is the dark side stronger?<br />- No, no.
3557900 3559777 Quicker, easier, more seductive.
3560620 3562611 How am I to know<br />the good side from the bad?
3562740 3564890 You will know...
3565020 3567170 when you are calm,<br />at peace...
3568220 3569573 passive.
3570620 3574613 AJedi uses the Force<br />for knowledge and defence...
3574740 3576492 never for attack.
3576620 3580090 - But tell me why I can't-<br />- No. There is no why.
3580220 3582859 Nothing more<br />will I teach you today.
3582980 3584857 Clear your mind of questions.
3607021 3608898 There's something not right here.
3612621 3613974 I feel cold.
3614821 3616300 - Death.<br />- That place...
3617381 3620738 is strong with<br />the dark side of the Force.
3620862 3622693 A domain of evil it is.
3624102 3625933 In you must go.
3627102 3628251 What's in there?
3630902 3633097 Only what you take with you.
3636742 3637891 Your weapons...
3638742 3640141 <i>you will not need them.</i>
3793827 3796182 Bounty hunters.<br />We don't need their scum.
3796307 3798946 - Yes, sir.<br />- Those rebels won't escape us.
3804427 3807578 <i>Sir, we have a priority signal<br />from the Stardestroyer Avenger.</i>
3807707 3809186 Right.
3809307 3814859 <i>There will be a substantial reward for<br />the one who finds the Millennium Falcon.</i>
3814987 3817899 You are free to use<br />any methods necessary...
3818027 3820063 but I want them alive.
3820187 3822496 No disintegrations.
3822627 3824380 - As you wish.<br />- Lord Vader.
3826588 3828419 My lord, we have them.
3832708 3835666 Thank goodness<br />we're coming out of the asteroid field.
3840708 3843176 Let's get out of here.<br />Ready for light speed?
3843308 3845424 One, two...
3845548 3846617 three!
3852988 3855138 It's not fair.
3856669 3859342 Transfer circuits aren't working.<br />It's not my fault.
3859469 3862267 - No light speed?<br />- It's not my fault.
3866869 3868780 Sir, we just lost<br />the main rear deflector shield.
3868909 3871059 One more direct hit<br />on the back quarter and we're done for.
3871189 3872827 Turn her around.
3872949 3875463 Turn her around! I'm gonna<br />put all power in the front shield.
3875589 3877500 - You're gonna attack?<br />- The odds of surviving...
3877629 3879460 a direct assault<br />on an imperial Stardestroyer-
3879589 3881420 Shut up!
3887669 3889546 They're moving to attack position.
3891670 3892705 Shields up.
3899030 3901498 Track them. They may<br />come around for another pass.
3901630 3903905 Captain Needa, the ship no longer<br />appears on our scopes.
3904030 3907500 They can't have disappeared. No ship<br />that small has a cloaking device.
3907630 3911305 - There's no trace of them.<br />- Captain, Lord Vader demands an update.
3914190 3916146 Get a shuttle ready.
3916270 3920024 I shall assume full responsibility for<br />losing them and apologize to Lord Vader.
3920150 3923108 - Meanwhile, continue to scan the area.<br />- Yes, Captain Needa.
3927631 3929781 Use the Force.
3929911 3930866 Yes.
3936271 3937943 Now, the stone.
3941951 3943509 Feel it.
3954751 3956469 Concentrate!
3970552 3973464 Oh, no.<br />We'll never get it out now.
3973592 3975230 So certain are you.
3979152 3982224 Always with you<br />it cannot be done.
3983432 3985309 Hear you nothing that I say?
3985432 3987423 Master, moving stones<br />around is one thing.
3987552 3989304 This is totally different.
3989432 3991583 No. No different.
3991713 3993704 Only different in your mind.
3993833 3996905 You must unlearn<br />what you have learned.
3998233 4001191 - All right. I'll give it a try.<br />- Try not.
4002033 4003386 Do...
4003513 4005026 or do not.
4005153 4006745 There is no try.
4053394 4056192 I can't. It's too big.
4056314 4058270 Size matters not.
4058395 4061273 Look at me.<br />Judge me by my size, do you?
4063915 4066668 And well you should not...
4066795 4069309 for my ally is the Force.
4069435 4071710 And a powerful ally it is.
4072755 4075030 Life creates it...
4075155 4077111 makes it grow.
4077955 4080628 Its energy surrounds us...
4081635 4083353 and binds us.
4083475 4086547 Luminous beings are we,<br />not this crude matter.
4087595 4090712 You must feel<br />the Force around you.
4091555 4094024 Here, between you, me...
4094876 4097026 the tree, the rock-
4097156 4099147 everywhere.
4099276 4100629 Yes...
4100756 4104385 even between<br />the land and the ship.
4109116 4111266 You want the impossible.
4214399 4216355 I don't believe it.
4218279 4220839 That is why you fail.
4239320 4242437 Apology accepted,<br />Captain Needa.
4250600 4253512 Lord Vader, our ships have completed<br />their scan and found nothing.
4253640 4255517 <i>If the Millennium Falcon<br />went into light speed...</i>
4255640 4257471 it'll be on the other side<br />of the galaxy now.
4257600 4259352 Alert all commands.
4259480 4263554 Calculate every possible destination<br />along their last known trajectory.
4263681 4266912 - Yes, my lord. We'll find them.<br />- Don't fail me again...
4267841 4269752 Admiral.
4271841 4274992 Alert all commands.<br />Deploy the fleet.
4289401 4292438 Captain Solo,<br />this time you have gone too far.
4292561 4295520 I will not be quiet, Chewbacca.<br />Why doesn't anyone listen to me?
4295642 4297598 The fleet's beginning to break up.
4297722 4300475 Go stand by the manual release<br />for the landing claw.
4302722 4304633 I really don't see<br />how that's going to help.
4304762 4308072 Surrender is a perfectly acceptable<br />alternative in extreme circumstances.
4308202 4310193 The Empire may be<br />gracious enough-
4310322 4312631 - Thank you.<br />- What did you have in mind next?
4312762 4314593 If they follow standard<br />imperial procedure...
4314722 4316872 they'll dump their garbage<br />before they go to light speed.
4317002 4319880 - Then we just float away.<br />- With the rest of the garbage.
4320002 4321355 Then what?
4321482 4324599 Then we gotta find a safe port<br />somewhere around here.
4324722 4326041 Any ideas?
4326162 4328438 - Where are we?<br />- The Anoat system.
4328563 4331031 The Anoat system.<br />There's not much there.
4331163 4333882 Oh, wait.<br />This is interesting.
4334003 4336756 - Lando.<br />- Lando system?
4336883 4340319 Lando's not a system.<br />He's a man. Lando Calrissian.
4340443 4342593 Card player, gambler.
4342723 4345191 - A scoundrel. You'd like him.<br />- Thanks.
4345323 4347883 Bespin. It's pretty far,<br />but I think we can make it.
4349323 4352235 - A mining colony?<br />- Yeah, a tibanna gas mine.
4353083 4355119 Lando conned somebody out of it.
4355243 4357837 We go back a long way,<br />Lando and me.
4359203 4361764 - Can you trust him?<br />- No.
4361884 4364637 But he's got no love for the Empire.<br />I can tell you that.
4365684 4368198 Here we go, Chewie.<br />Stand by. Detach.
4375124 4376603 You do have your moments.
4377444 4380163 Not many of them,<br />but you do have them.
4413525 4415356 Concentrate.
4415485 4418557 Feel the Force flow.
4418685 4420243 Yes.
4427605 4429198 Good.
4429326 4430645 Calm.
4430766 4432040 Yes.
4432966 4435400 Through the Force,<br />things you will see.
4435526 4438836 Other places.<br />The future. The past.
4438966 4441275 Old friends long gone.
4451366 4452765 Control, control.
4452886 4455002 You must learn control.
4457926 4460724 I saw a city in the clouds.
4462727 4464797 Friends you have there.
4465847 4469317 - They were in pain.<br />- It is the future you see.
4470487 4471442 Future?
4480087 4481440 Will they die?
4484567 4486558 Difficult to see.
4486687 4489042 Always in motion is the future.
4491447 4492800 I've gotta go to them.
4494727 4497640 Decide you must<br />how to serve them best.
4497768 4500521 If you leave now,<br />help them you could...
4501568 4504958 but you would destroy all<br />for which they have fought and suffered.
4518448 4521121 No, I don't have a landing permit.
4521248 4524718 I'm trying to reach Lando Calrissian.
4524848 4526884 Wait a minute!<br />Let me explain!
4527008 4528885 <i>You will not deviate<br />from your present course.</i>
4529008 4531603 - Rather touchy, aren't they?<br />- I thought you knew this person.
4534409 4537082 That was a long time ago.<br />I'm sure he's forgotten about that.
4545329 4548799 <i>Permission granted to land<br />on Platform 327.</i>
4548929 4550248 Thank you.
4551129 4553882 Nothing to worry about.<br />We go way back, Lando and me.
4554009 4555601 Who's worried?
4602451 4603804 No one to meet us.
4605171 4607401 I don't like this.
4607531 4610250 - What would you like?<br />- They did let us land.
4610371 4612965 Look, don't worry.<br />Everything's gonna be fine.
4613091 4614649 Trust me.
4619211 4621167 See? My friend.
4625411 4627367 Keep your eyes open.
4629971 4631530 Hey.
4631652 4635565 Why, you slimy, double-crossing,<br />no-good swindler.
4635692 4639731 You've got a lot of guts coming here,<br />after what you pulled.
4649812 4653122 How you doin', you old pirate?<br />So good to see you!
4653252 4656164 - I never thought I'd see you again.<br />- Well, he seems very friendly.
4656292 4659250 Yes. Very friendly.
4659372 4660930 What are you doing here?
4661052 4662963 <i>Repairs. I thought<br />you could help me out.</i>
4663092 4665607 - What have you done to my ship?<br />- Your ship?
4665733 4669123 <i>Hey, remember,<br />you lost her to me fair and square.</i>
4669973 4671292 How you doin', Chewbacca?
4672213 4674773 Still hanging around with this loser?
4676693 4678923 Hello.<br />What have we here?
4680373 4683763 Welcome. I'm Lando Calrissian.<br />I'm the administrator of this facility.
4683893 4686691 - And who might you be?<br />- Leia.
4686813 4688371 Welcome, Leia.
4691093 4693812 All right, all right.<br />You old smoothie.
4693933 4697403 Hello, sir. I am C-3PO,<br />human-cyborg relations.
4697533 4700207 My facilities are at your-<br />Well, really!
4700334 4702609 <i>- What's wrong with the Falcon?<br />- Hyperdrive.</i>
4702734 4704690 - I'll get my people to work on her.<br />- Good.
4704814 4706770 That ship saved my life<br />quite a few times.
4706894 4709328 She's the fastest<br />hunk of junk in the galaxy.
4710614 4712969 How's the gas mine?<br />Still paying off for you?
4713094 4716769 Not as well as I'd like. We're a small<br />outpost and not very self-sufficient.
4716894 4719852 I've had supply problems<br />of every kind.
4719974 4722044 I've had labour difficulties.
4722174 4725291 - What's so funny?<br />- You. Listen to you.
4725414 4728087 You sound like a businessman,<br />a responsible leader.
4728214 4730011 Who'd have thought that, huh?
4730134 4732933 Seeing you sure brings back<br />a few things.
4733055 4734204 Yeah.
4734335 4736371 Yeah, I'm responsible these days.
4737215 4739775 It's the price you pay<br />for being successful.
4742895 4744851 Nice to see a familiar face.
4744975 4746533 How rude!
4748055 4750011 That sounds like<br />an R2 unit in there.
4750135 4751648 I wonder if- Hello?
4753815 4755294 How interesting.
4755415 4758373 - Who are you?<br />- Oh, my. I'm terribly sorry.
4758495 4760451 I didn't mean to intrude.<br />Please don't get up.
4778176 4780644 Luke, you must complete the training.
4781696 4784369 I can't keep the vision out of my head.<br />I've gotta help them.
4784496 4786532 You must not go.
4786656 4789614 <i>- But Han and Leia will die if I don't.<br />- You don't know that.</i>
4792496 4795056 Even Yoda cannot see their fate.
4795176 4797815 But I can help them.<br />I feel the Force.
4797936 4800007 But you cannot control it.
4800217 4802447 This is a dangerous time for you...
4802577 4805455 when you will be tempted<br />by the dark side of the Force.
4805577 4808649 Yes, yes.<br />To Obi-Wan you listen.
4809497 4810850 The cave.
4810977 4812968 Remember your failure at the cave.
4813097 4814928 But I've learned<br />so much since then.
4815057 4817617 Master Yoda, I promise to return<br />and finish what I've begun.
4817737 4819614 You have my word.
4819737 4822410 It is you and your abilities<br />the emperor wants.
4822537 4825131 That is why your friends<br />are made to suffer.
4826537 4829097 That's why I have to go.
4829217 4833370 Luke, I don't want to lose you<br />to the emperor the way I lost Vader.
4833498 4834931 You won't.
4835858 4839214 Stopped they must be.<br />On this all depends.
4840058 4843368 Only a fully trained Jedi knight,<br />with the Force as his ally...
4843498 4845966 will conquer Vader<br />and his emperor.
4846098 4848089 If you end your training now...
4848218 4852336 if you choose the quick and easy path,<br />as Vader did...
4852458 4854972 <i>you will become an agent of evil.</i>
4855098 4856008 Patience.
4856938 4861136 - And sacrifice Han and Leia?<br />- If you honour what they fight for...
4861258 4862213 yes.
4862338 4865296 <i>If you choose to face Vader,<br />you will do it alone.</i>
4865418 4867330 I cannot interfere.
4869339 4870488 I understand.
4875779 4878452 R2, fire up the converters.
4883619 4885496 Don't give in to hate.
4885619 4888258 That leads to the dark side.
4888379 4890017 Strong is Vader.
4890139 4892528 Mind what you have learned.<br />Save you it can.
4893459 4894892 I will.
4895019 4897374 And I'll return. I promise.
4904180 4907092 Told you, I did.<br />Reckless is he.
4907220 4908733 Now...
4908860 4910532 matters are worse.
4910660 4912616 <i>That boy is our last hope.</i>
4912740 4915538 No, there is another.
4946381 4949532 The ship's almost finished. Two or three<br />more things and we're in great shape.
4949661 4951617 The sooner the better.<br />Something's wrong here.
4951741 4953697 No one has seen or knows<br />anything about 3PO.
4953821 4955937 He's been gone too long<br />to have gotten lost.
4956061 4957699 Relax.
4957821 4960574 I'll talk to Lando<br />and see what I can find out.
4960701 4963056 I don't trust Lando.
4963181 4966378 Well, I don't trust him either,<br />but he is my friend.
4966501 4969062 Besides, we'll soon be gone.
4970462 4972418 Then you're as good as gone,<br />aren't you?
5006023 5007456 What happened?
5008503 5009140 Where?
5011223 5013134 Found him in a junk pile?
5013263 5015697 What a mess.<br />Chewie, you think you can repair him?
5017783 5021139 - Lando's got people that can fix him.<br />- No, thanks.
5022663 5024415 I'm sorry.<br />Am I interrupting anything?
5025343 5026412 Not really.
5029823 5031734 You look absolutely beautiful.
5031863 5035015 You truly belong here<br />with us among the clouds.
5035144 5036543 Thank you.
5036664 5039462 Would you join me<br />for a little refreshment?
5039584 5042257 Everyone's invited, of course.
5042384 5044375 Having trouble with your droid?
5044504 5047018 No. No problem. Why?
5055504 5057893 You see, since we're<br />a small operation...
5058024 5061141 we don't fall into<br />the jurisdiction of the Empire.
5061264 5063698 - So you're part of the Mining Guild?<br />- No, not actually.
5063824 5065894 Our operation is small enough<br />not to be noticed.
5066024 5067980 Which is advantageous<br />for everybody...
5068104 5072337 since our customers are anxious to avoid<br />attracting attention to themselves.
5072465 5076174 Aren't you afraid the Empire's<br />gonna find out, shut you down?
5076305 5079456 It's been a danger that looms like<br />a shadow over everything we've built.
5079585 5082179 But things have developed<br />that'll ensure security.
5082305 5085456 I've just made a deal that'll keep<br />the Empire out of here forever.
5094785 5097458 We would be honoured<br />if you would join us.
5104066 5106341 I had no choice.<br />They arrived right before you did.
5107266 5108858 I'm sorry.
5112226 5113500 I'm sorry too.
5127746 5129065 No, 3PO's with them.
5130426 5132417 Just hang on.<br />We're almost there.
5189548 5191903 I'm terribly sorry.<br />I didn't mean to intrude.
5192028 5193905 No, please don't get up.
5199508 5202739 Stormtroopers? Here?<br />We're in danger.
5202869 5205337 I must tell the others.<br />Oh, no! I've been shot!
5232029 5233587 Lord Vader.
5233709 5235984 You may take Captain Solo<br />to Jabba the Hutt...
5236109 5238021 after I have Skywalker.
5238150 5239947 He's no good to me dead.
5240070 5243221 He will not be<br />permanently damaged.
5245550 5247984 Lord Vader, what about Leia<br />and the Wookiee?
5248110 5250704 They must never again leave this city.
5250830 5253902 That wasn't part of our agreement, nor<br />was giving Han to this bounty hunter!
5254030 5257784 Perhaps you think you're<br />being treated unfairly?
5260430 5261385 No.
5261510 5264900 Good. It would be unfortunate<br />if I had to leave a garrison here.
5267230 5269505 This deal is getting worse<br />all the time.
5270671 5272946 Oh, yes, that's very good.<br />I like that.
5274511 5276945 Something's not right<br />because now I can't see.
5279391 5281507 That's much better.
5281631 5283189 Wait. Wait.
5283311 5285267 Oh, my!<br />What have you done?
5285391 5286870 I'm backwards!
5286991 5288788 You flea-bitten furball!
5288911 5291471 Only an overgrown mophead like you<br />would be stupid enough-
5305472 5307349 I feel terrible.
5321992 5323948 Why are they doing this?
5326352 5328912 They never even asked me<br />any questions.
5337873 5339943 - Get out of here, Lando.<br />- Shut up and listen.
5340073 5343031 Vader's agreed<br />to turn Leia and Chewie over to me.
5343153 5344950 They'll have to stay here,<br />but they'll be safe.
5345073 5347109 - And Han?<br />- Vader's given him to the bounty hunter.
5347233 5349542 - Vader wants us all dead.<br />- He doesn't want you at all.
5349673 5352904 He's after somebody<br />called Skywalker.
5353033 5355467 - Lord Vader set a trap for him.<br />- And we're the bait.
5355593 5357345 - He's on his way.<br />- Perfect.
5358273 5360389 You fixed us all real good,<br />didn't you?
5360513 5361628 My friend.
5364513 5365662 Stop!
5366913 5368983 I've done all I can.
5369113 5371423 Sorry I couldn't do better,<br />but I got my own problems.
5371554 5372782 Yeah.
5372914 5374666 You're a real hero.
5385034 5387389 You certainly<br />have a way with people.
5401194 5402946 This facility is crude...
5403074 5406033 but it should be adequate<br />to freeze Skywalker...
5406155 5408305 for his journey to the emperor.
5408435 5411313 Lord Vader,<br />ship approaching, X-wing class.
5411435 5414666 Good. Monitor Skywalker<br />and allow him to land.
5416155 5420671 Lord Vader, we only use this facility<br />for carbon freezing. It might kill him.
5420795 5423548 I do not want<br />the emperor's prize damaged.
5423675 5426633 We will test it on Captain Solo.
5449436 5453475 If you'd attached my legs I wouldn't<br />be in this ridiculous position.
5453596 5456156 <i>Now remember, Chewbacca,<br />you have a responsibility for me...</i>
5456276 5457914 so don't do anything foolish.
5471436 5473393 What's going on, buddy?
5474317 5476308 You're being put into carbon freeze.
5476437 5479793 What if he doesn't survive?<br />He's worth a lot to me.
5479917 5483148 The Empire will compensate you<br />if he dies. Put him in.
5486957 5488072 Chewbacca, stop!
5488197 5490108 No, Chewie, stop!
5490237 5493115 You're going to get us all killed!<br />Yes, stop. I'm not ready to die.
5493237 5495114 Hey! Hey!<br />Listen to me.
5495237 5497626 Chewie, this won't help me.
5497757 5500225 Hey, save your strength.<br />There'll be another time.
5502037 5503595 The princess.
5503717 5505389 You have to take care of her.
5507558 5509469 Do you hear me?
5522798 5525631 - I love you.<br />- I know.
5553639 5557075 What's going on?<br />Turn round. I can't see.
5613561 5615517 They've encased him in carbonite.
5615641 5617438 He should be quite<br />well-protected...
5617561 5619392 if he survived<br />the freezing process, that is.
5619521 5621910 Well, Calrissian, did he survive?
5622041 5623599 Yes, he's alive.
5624441 5626238 And in perfect hibernation.
5627161 5629197 He's all yours, bounty hunter.
5630041 5631679 Reset the chamber for Skywalker.
5634001 5635753 Skywalker has just landed, lord.
5635881 5639590 Good. See to it<br />that he finds his way in here.
5643682 5645479 Calrissian...
5645602 5647911 take the princess<br />and the Wookiee to my ship.
5648042 5650078 You said they'd be left<br />under my supervision.
5650202 5652158 I am altering the deal.
5652282 5654876 Pray I don't alter it any further.
5748165 5750599 Luke, don't! It's a trap!
5752045 5753080 It's a trap!
5797606 5799881 <i>The Force is with you,<br />young Skywalker.</i>
5802206 5804162 But you are not a Jedi yet.
5863648 5865206 Well done.
5866928 5869601 Hold them in the security tower.<br />And keep it quiet.
5869728 5871320 Move.
5875608 5878760 - What do you think you're doing?<br />- We're getting out of here.
5878889 5880561 I knew all along.<br />It had to be a mistake.
5880689 5883408 Do you think that<br />after what you did to Han-
5884369 5887520 - I had no choice.<br />- What are you doing? Trust him!
5887649 5890527 We understand, don't we, Chewie?<br />He had no choice.
5890649 5892128 I'm just trying to help.
5892249 5894763 We don't need any of your help.
5899689 5901122 What?
5901249 5905640 - It sounds like Han.<br />- There's still a chance to save Han...
5906569 5909686 at the east... platform.
5913730 5915766 I'm terribly sorry about all this.
5915890 5917562 After all, he's only a Wookiee.
5918490 5921050 Put Captain Solo<br />in the cargo hold.
5935650 5937800 R2, where have you been?
5937930 5939727 Wait. Turn around, you woolly-
5940890 5943530 Hurry! We're trying to save<br />Han from the bounty hunter.
5946171 5948480 <i>Well, at least<br />you're still in one piece.</i>
5948611 5950841 Look what's happened to me.
5962331 5964799 Oh, no!<br />Chewie, they're behind you!
5977252 5979482 You have learned much, young one.
5979612 5981648 You'll find I'm full of surprises.
5992772 5995730 Your destiny lies with me, Skywalker.
5996572 5998927 Obi-Wan knew this to be true.
6006692 6007966 All too easy.
6013013 6015368 Perhaps you're not as strong<br />as the emperor thought.
6018413 6019971 Impressive.
6021853 6023206 Most impressive.
6030773 6034288 Obi-Wan has taught you well.<br />You have controlled your fear.
6036973 6040045 Now, release your anger.
6040173 6042641 Only your hatred can destroy me.
6168257 6170088 The security code<br />has been changed.
6170217 6173368 R2, you can tell the computer<br />to override the security systems.
6174297 6175935 R2, hurry.
6179097 6181293 <i>Attention.<br />This is Lando Calrissian. Attention.</i>
6181418 6183295 <i>The Empire has taken control<br />of the city.</i>
6183418 6186137 <i>I advise everyone to leave<br />before more imperial troops arrive.</i>
6192378 6193936 This way.
6194058 6196174 Well, don't blame me.<br />I'm an interpreter.
6196298 6199051 I'm not supposed to know a power socket<br />from a computer terminal.
6219779 6222577 <i>We're not interested in the hyperdrive<br />on the Falcon. It's fixed!</i>
6227379 6230052 <i>Just open the door,<br />you stupid lump!</i>
6238299 6240608 I never doubted you for a second.<br />Wonderful!
6264140 6266734 <i>That hurts! Bend down,<br />you thoughtless- Ow!</i>
6273580 6274899 Go!
6281061 6283734 I thought that hairy beast<br />would be the end of me.
6283861 6285658 Of course I've looked better.
6337142 6340657 You are beaten.<br />It is useless to resist.
6340782 6344138 Don't let yourself be destroyed<br />as Obi-Wan did.
6359303 6360861 There is no escape.
6361703 6363739 Don't make me destroy you.
6367583 6370222 <i>You do not yet realize<br />your importance.</i>
6370343 6372903 You have only begun<br />to discover your power.
6373023 6374775 Join me...
6374903 6377178 and I will complete your training.
6377303 6379578 With our combined strength...
6379703 6382502 we can end<br />this destructive conflict...
6382624 6384819 and bring order to the galaxy.
6384944 6387333 I'll never join you!
6387464 6391377 If you only knew the power<br />of the dark side.
6391504 6395543 Obi-Wan never told you<br />what happened to your father.
6395664 6397017 He told me enough.
6399544 6401296 He told me you killed him.
6403024 6405015 I am your father.
6413224 6415056 That's not true.
6415905 6417463 That's impossible!
6417585 6420702 Search your feelings.<br />You know it to be true.
6429185 6433144 You can destroy the emperor.<br />He has foreseen this.
6433265 6436018 It is your destiny.
6436145 6437783 Join me...
6437905 6442023 and together we can rule the galaxy<br />as father and son.
6452226 6453784 Come with me.
6454626 6456696 It is the only way.
6520268 6521587 Ben.
6522428 6524180 Ben, please.
6550989 6552502 Hear me.
6559189 6561145 - We've got to go back.<br />- What?
6561269 6563499 - I know where Luke is.<br />- What about those fighters?
6564589 6566739 Chewie, just do it.
6566869 6568507 All right, all right!
6576389 6580268 Alert my Stardestroyer<br />to prepare for my arrival.
6590390 6592346 Look, someone's up there.
6593550 6595905 It's Luke.<br />Chewie, slow down.
6596030 6599181 We'll get under him.<br />Lando, open the top hatch.
6614470 6616700 Okay. Easy, Chewie.
6637591 6639627 <i>- Lando?<br />- Okay, let's go.</i>
6658872 6660225 All right, Chewie. Let's go.
6694353 6696105 I'll be back.
6701633 6702952 Stardestroyer.
6707993 6710348 All right, Chewie.<br />Ready for light speed.
6710473 6712429 If your people fixed the hyperdrive.
6712553 6714783 All the coordinates are set.<br />It's now or never.
6714913 6716312 Punch it!
6726554 6728749 They told me they fixed it.
6728874 6730671 I trusted them!
6730794 6733183 It's not my fault!
6738594 6741108 They'll be in range<br />of our tractor beam in moments, lord.
6741234 6744624 <i>Did your men deactivate the hyperdrive<br />on the Millennium Falcon?</i>
6744754 6746665 - Yes, my lord.<br />- Good.
6746794 6750264 Prepare the boarding party<br />and set your weapons for stun.
6750394 6753273 - Yes, my lord. Lieutenant.<br />- Yes, sir.
6754795 6757946 Noisy brute. Why don't we<br />just go into light speed?
6758075 6759588 We can't?
6759715 6761990 How would you know<br />the hyperdrive is deactivated?
6765155 6767908 The city's central computer told you?
6768035 6770674 R2-D2, you know better<br />than to trust a strange computer.
6770795 6773946 Ouch! Pay attention<br />to what you're doing.
6785756 6786871 Father.
6788676 6790712 Son, come with me.
6793636 6794989 Ben.
6796036 6798027 Why didn't you tell me?
6815516 6816665 It's Vader.
6822277 6825713 Luke, it is your destiny.
6833117 6835267 Why didn't you tell me?
6841317 6845071 Alert all commands.<br />Ready for the tractor beam.
6848397 6851036 R2, come back at once!<br />You haven't finished with me yet.
6851157 6854514 You don't know how to fix the<br />hyperdrive. Chewbacca can do it.
6854638 6858870 I'm standing here in pieces<br />and you're having delusions of grandeur!
6861918 6863317 You did it!
