5756 7756 Hi, this is Peter Jackson, the director.
9843 11193 Hi, I'm Fran Walsh, writer.
12262 13388 Hi, I'm Philippa Boyens,<br />one of the other writers.
13472 16224 And this is the director's and<br />writers' commentary, I guess, isn't it?
16308 17768 -The final.<br />-Final one.
17935 20103 Four hours and 10<br />minutes long, this movie is.
20187 21646 Is that…<br />That's without the credits, isn't it?
21730 22563 Yeah.
23649 24699 There will be a test.
26443 32198 So the credits are pretty much the same<br />as they have been on the previous films.
32282 34159 In fact, I think this is the<br /><i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> title
34243 37538 that we've just rehashed<br />twice before, which is good.
37704 42251 It's a very cost-effective way to make<br />films, to use the same title three times.
44127 46171 This scene was directed by Fran.
46338 47673 -Yeah.<br />-We had a choice.
47839 49257 We could have opened<br />on a wide shot of the river
49341 51551 we could have opened on a<br />fishing line going into the water.
51635 54054 But that shot that you<br />guys did of the worm
54221 56181 that pulls focus to Andy's face
56348 59893 I just think that's a great way to<br />open the movie, on a wriggling worm.
59977 61535 I really liked that as a start.
61577 63827 Well, that's actually<br />a literary allusion…
64022 66191 Worms, apples, the fall.
66358 67651 -The fall?<br />-Gardens.
67818 69486 She's lying.
70153 71572 He believed me.
76660 77911 …in a film we did<br />called <i>Forgotten Silver.</i>
77995 80895 We asked Tom if he'd like to<br />just do this very small cameo.
81039 82958 This sequence was shot at Fernside.
83125 85460 It stood in for a river,<br />but it's actually not a river.
85544 88296 It's a very small lake, which is<br />useful for when you're making a film.
88380 89631 You know, you're not in danger
89715 92300 of boats and crew members<br />floating off down the river.
92384 94884 Andy wasn't originally<br />going to be Sméagol, was he?
95095 98195 We sort of cast Andy for the<br />voice way back at the beginning…
100392 101601 And we had ideas for other<br />actors, didn't we, for Sméagol?
101685 104312 Sort of it's amazing, because it<br />seems so obvious now, doesn't it?
104396 107149 It took us a while to get to<br />the point where we thought:
107316 110027 "Well, obviously we should have Andy."
110193 113393 This sequence always felt like<br />a good place to start the movie…
115449 118701 And if you start with that and you<br />end with it going into the Crack of Doom
118785 121246 it had a kind of nice unity to it.
126793 127961 Because <i>The Two Towers</i><br />was about other things,
128045 129629 -but not really about the Ring.<br />-Yeah.
129713 132715 And yet, this movie, we had<br />to bring the Ring right back up
132799 134759 into the forefront of the story again.<br />And so…
134843 137428 How were we gonna start<br /><i>Return of the King</i> if it wasn't…
137512 139597 Because this was supposed<br />to be in <i>The Two Towers.</i>
139681 141431 We actually shot one idea we had,
142225 145325 -and it was always a placeholder.<br />-That's right, I remember.
148440 148815 We go rushing across<br />the plains of Edoras.
148982 150900 I remember we did a<br />sped-up helicopter shot,
150984 154584 and we crash into the Golden Hall,<br />and he wakes up out of a nightmare.
154738 156823 And that was actually supposed<br />to be the beginning, wasn't it?
156907 158866 -Yes, it was.<br />-And what it ended up happening is
158950 161202 we inherited two scenes<br />from <i>The Two Towers.</i>
161286 164038 If you remember in <i>The Two<br />Towers,</i> in the Dead Marshes
164122 166374 there's a scene where<br />Frodo goes over to Gollum
166458 170169 he calls him Sméagol, and Gollum goes<br />into this slight reverie, this moment.
170253 172303 And that was the queue for the flashback.
172464 175383 And for length reasons we didn't put<br />it in the theatrical of <i>The Two Towers.</i>
175467 177969 And then we thought, by the time<br />we were cutting the extended edition
178053 181056 of <i>The Two Towers,</i> we<br />had got the idea at that stage
181223 183725 to maybe save it for… For this movie.
184101 187020 We had done the big James Bond<br />kind of pre-credit sequence thing
187104 189606 on <i>The Two Towers</i> with the<br />big fight, and I didn't wanna
189690 193359 have to sit and dream up another<br />big slam-bang action scene for this film
193443 195570 because it felt like we had<br />been falling into a pattern
195654 198073 -a franchise pattern, as it were.<br />-Yeah.
198240 200491 When we realized that<br />we had available to us
200575 202244 this Sméagol-Déagol scene
202411 205204 it seemed like a counter to<br />how <i>The Two Towers</i> opened.
205288 207248 Because I know that Andy<br />was really disappointed
207332 210460 that it was cut out of <i>The Two Towers,</i><br />because he… You know, he was aware
210544 213880 it was his… It was his moment to<br />have his real face seen on-screen.
213964 217216 And then we cut it… We cut him out,<br />and I think he was never quite believing
217300 219719 that we were gonna…<br />Actually gonna use the scene at all.
219803 221304 Probably not.
223348 224974 I didn't shoot any of this scene.
225058 228061 I was busy on another set,<br />and we had no other directors.
228228 231878 And so we said to Andy, "Listen, do<br />you mind if you direct yourself today?
232023 234818 Because there's no one<br />else that we can find to do it."
235318 237468 Yeah, I love the sound<br />design in this scene.
240490 242909 …and just let the kind of intensity<br />of the moment really take over.
242993 247706 And at one point we cut the effects<br />back, and it wasn't half as scary.
253837 254712 …because, remember, the MPAA<br />asked us to reduce the intensity…
254796 256673 …and we shortened one<br />of the strangling shots…
256757 258675 …and then we put it back<br />at its original length here.
258759 262679 So this is the complete, full<br />strangulation, never seen before
262846 265307 here exclusively on DVD.
267517 271855 In this shot here, old Tom, who<br />is trying his hardest to be dead
272022 273773 actually blinked right<br />in the middle of the shot.
273857 276442 But Andy's performance was<br />so great in this particular take
276526 278444 that we wanted to use the blinking one,
278528 283116 so we had Weta…<br />The CG guys at Weta freeze his eyes.
283283 285535 So we removed the blink from his eyes.
298215 300165 This was a sequence that Fran directed.
300300 303302 We built the set very quickly,<br />because it was an idea that you had
303386 306347 that wasn't really part of the<br />script, to show this deterioration,
306431 310936 and we put a guerrilla crew together<br />so that you could film it with Andy.
311102 313752 We were trying to figure<br />out all the different ways…
316566 316900 We could use this set, which<br />was really a little gully, a rock gully.
317067 320904 So we drowned it in rain, we<br />dried it out and drowned it in lights
321071 323240 -threw some greenery in.<br />-Yeah.
323406 327410 We just tried to give it variation.<br />And also to show, obviously
327577 328829 passage of time.
328995 332123 -That was a huge makeup, wasn't it?<br />-It was enormous.
332207 334084 He was in there for how long?
334251 336502 -I couldn't tell you.<br />-Hours and hours and hours.
336586 337838 Forever.
339339 343191 I love this stuff here with the fish.
345262 347764 Weren't Andy's legs too muscular,<br />though, Pete? Did you guys…
347848 351198 Yeah, the shot of him on the rocks<br />before he goes in the cave, we…
352936 354562 He had these very chunky, muscly legs.
354646 358608 And so we had the CG department<br />thin them down on the computer
358775 360276 to make them look more emaciated.
360360 362863 And this shot here he<br />has an eye enlargement
363029 366157 where we used the computer to…<br />To make his eyes bigger,
366324 369118 so that he would start to look<br />a little bit more like Gollum.
369202 373790 We also morphed some of the<br />CG Gollum's face with Andy's.
373957 377126 We kind of mixed the two faces<br />together, because we wanted him to look
377210 380463 like he was almost on the verge of<br />becoming the full version of Gollum
380547 381548 the CG creature.
381715 385065 We wanted to get a little bit more<br />of that feeling into Andy's face.
387554 391391 This was a sequence that was<br />shot on a day that it snowed.
391558 395478 Now, you don't see the snow here,<br />but we were in a place called Ruapehu
395645 396855 which is a volcano.
397022 398815 And it was late summer,
398982 400775 and it was absolutely<br />not supposed to snow.
400859 404403 But it was one of our days that…<br />We had several during our lengthy shoot
404487 406387 where there was unseasonal weather.
406531 410327 And it was like, "Oh, it's the first<br />time it's snowed here for 65 years."
410493 412328 It was like. "Oh, yeah, sure.<br />Well, great."
412412 414962 I remember you were<br />standing out in the middle of…
417792 418084 You know, the snow was sort of raining<br />down on everybody, and you were saying:
418251 420351 "Snow?<br />This isn't snow, it's volcanic ash."
420503 423506 -Yeah, that's true.<br />-I was trying to be optimistic.
427469 430369 And this was a big culvert,<br />this was a set that we built…
432891 434767 And you're looking at shots here<br />that were done in the year 2000.
434851 438188 And then we had Elijah and Sean<br />come back to do some close-ups.
438355 440857 Now, when you look at them when they're…<br />They're talking,
440941 442859 and they're just…<br />The wall of the culvert behind them.
442943 445695 There's four years between<br />some of these shots.
454788 456538 That's original, that shot there,
457916 459500 but the reason we did the pickups was…
459584 463546 One of the reasons was we wanted to<br />set up Sam's belief in the journey home,
463713 467258 and the possibility of a journey home<br />that we were going to take away from him
467342 470928 on the slopes of Mount Doom, to<br />help reinforce the water-bottle scene
471012 472805 which was one of the reasons of…<br />For the pickups.
472889 476601 And we also felt we hadn't really<br />established the lembas bread properly,
476768 478102 and the importance of it.
478186 480536 Well, we'd established<br />it in the previous movie.
483441 485234 Because the lembas, obviously, is<br />a catalyst for turning Sam and Frodo
485318 488571 against each other.<br />So we wanted to re-establish it.
490281 494577 The lembas bread was just a bit of bloody<br />old pastry that wasn't really tasty.
494744 496371 -Not really.<br />-Did you try it?
496538 498039 A little peckish, just that…
498206 499999 Just when you're waiting<br />for the lunch break to happen,
500083 502001 and you look around and<br />see if there's any nibbles,
502085 504420 and the craft services<br />table is a bit far away,
504504 507214 but there's always the lembas bread<br />lying there in the prop department.
507298 509050 -Pete, that's desperate.<br />-Yeah, I know. That's where…
509134 511719 That's where it all went when<br />the props people were complaining
511803 513512 that somebody was stealing it. It was me.
513596 514946 It wasn't Gollum after all.
515265 516615 It wasn't Gollum after all.
522897 526097 …these close-ups were done<br />four years after the original shots.
533324 535785 We were lucky here,<br />because this landscape
535952 539622 on the slopes of Ruapehu.<br />Actually had a fire, a forest fire.
539789 542500 About six months before<br />we were due to shoot there
542667 544794 it had all been burnt<br />through with a blaze.
544878 549466 And so we had this great landscape that<br />was sort of ashy and volcanic-looking.
549632 552301 But it was actually the result<br />of a fire that had swept through,
552385 554137 and killed all the undergrowth.
554304 557974 It's a great location for a World War<br />I film, burnt trees and scorched land.
558058 560143 And yeah. Yeah.
562771 565064 I always thought this was a<br />dodgy scene, because we shot it
565148 568359 in our Fangorn set in the<br />studio, which was a tiny studio,
568526 572864 and you can basically look at a<br />painted cyclorama in the background.
574949 578495 And it's one of the reasons why<br />we shot it so much out of focus
578661 582111 is to try to disguise the fact that<br />it was just a painted backdrop.
584584 586419 And that shot there, in particular.
592008 595511 This is a big miniature that was<br />shot out in the back of the parking lot.
595595 597513 That circle of Isengard with the tower.
597597 600891 I mean, the tower itself was<br />about 14 feet tall, and the circle was
600975 603186 I don't know, 50 feet in diameter.
605021 606397 This was a fun scene.
606564 608941 We actually ended up<br />picking quite conservative takes
609025 611777 because they shot five or six<br />takes of this particular sequence,
611861 614781 and Billy and Dom<br />gave us a lot of variations
614948 617116 in just how stoned they<br />were, and there were some
617200 619827 actually quite funny ones where<br />they were incredibly stoned.
619911 624040 And I ended up using ones that<br />were a little bit more conservative.
624207 626626 But there are some very funny outtakes.
626918 629168 This plays particularly<br />well if you've seen…
632215 634115 And seen them find Saruman's hoard.
634259 637309 All shot in a tiny little studio,<br />and we used a blue screen…
639889 640431 Behind Billy and Dom, but<br />we just had this little bit of trees,
640598 644561 and piece of the wall, and it was<br />very cramped and very claustrophobic,
644727 646914 and we're sort of<br />lucky that, in the movie,
646956 648977 people don't think about that too much.
650150 652526 That's why I, you know…<br />We used those big miniature shots
652610 655572 to try to bust it open a<br />bit, to give a sense of scale
655738 658616 when no scale actually exists.
662912 667542 The whole Isengard sequence<br />was supposed to be at the end
667709 671713 of <i>Two Towers,</i> and it… We just<br />felt that by the time we got through
671880 675007 the battle of Helm's Deep, that<br />that film really needed to wind down,
675091 676759 and be over and done with,
676926 679804 and, you know, if you were returning to<br />Isengard at the end of <i>The Two Towers,</i>
679888 681847 and you obviously had to<br />have the scene in its entirety
681931 683599 which was upwards of 10 minutes long…
683683 688354 And it was just a very<br />anticlimactic way to end that movie
688521 690356 after you've had this huge battle.
690440 692358 -And so I think we did the right thing…<br />-Yeah.
692442 693984 …in relationship to <i>The Two Towers…</i>
694068 695694 …because we were looking<br />after that film last year…
695778 697863 …and that was where our<br />attention and focus was…
697947 701347 …and then this year we had what<br />we ultimately felt was a problem…
701451 706080 …because we had to have the<br />scene, because of the palantír.
706247 709292 That was really the main<br />reason why our characters
709459 712920 had to go back to Isengard.<br />It wasn't to deal to Saruman, we felt,
713004 715506 and that's obviously why Saruman<br />was deleted out of the theatrical version
715590 718634 of <i>The Return of the King,</i> generally,<br />because we felt it was about Sauron
718718 720219 as the villain of this film.
720303 723681 And when we were thinking about<br />the opening, and the overall length
723765 725391 of <i>Return of the King,</i><br />this was a sequence
725475 728894 we were just always worried about,<br />and for a long time the thinking was:
728978 731772 "Well, is there a way that we<br />don't have them return to Isengard?
731856 734734 Can they pick up the<br />palantír somewhere else?"
735318 738654 And then we couldn't figure out a way<br />to do that, and so then the idea came:
738738 741365 "Well, they could go to Isengard,<br />but they don't encounter Saruman."
741449 745161 Which was the second plan. And that<br />was a tough decision to make, obviously
745245 747955 from the point of view of not<br />having Christopher in the film,
748039 749290 but still having Isengard.
749374 751709 It was easier, in a way, if we<br />just didn't go to Isengard at all
751793 753752 we wouldn't have actually<br />had to face that problem.
753836 758086 But we ended up just doing what we could<br />to push the theatrical version of the film
758174 759634 along at a speedy pace.
759801 762901 It is very much going backwards<br />in terms of the storytelling…
765223 767737 It needed to be providing<br />fresh information,
767779 770103 it needed to be moving the story onward.
770270 772605 So we attempted to do<br />that within the pickups.
772772 775983 Really what we were trying to do<br />was pin the tension on the possibility
776067 779904 that Saruman knows something<br />that Gandalf needs to know.
780071 783950 That thing that he knew was<br />Denethor, and that Denethor
784117 787870 was a grave danger to Minas<br />Tirith, and that Minas Tirith would fall,
788037 790832 and that he knows exactly<br />what Sauron's plans were.
790999 792791 But in the greater scheme<br />of things, that was just us
792875 798339 desperately trying to make a scene work<br />that really was still going backwards,
798506 801175 and wasn't really<br />driving the story forward.
807765 808974 It was very windy that day.
809058 812658 It was very windy, and the wind<br />kind of dictated the look of the scene…
814731 817399 His hair was blowing into<br />his mouth while he was talking,
817483 819026 and his beard and robes<br />were blowing around.
819110 823197 But I kind of like the look of it.<br />It has an organic kind of reality to it.
823364 826325 And it was interesting, because<br />the original shooting of that scene
826409 830163 back in 2000, was done with<br />the wind and the look and the feel
830330 833958 then when we wrote some<br />extra lines for him to do last year
834125 836670 we did those pickups<br />three years after the
836712 839422 original shoot, in…<br />In a studio this time.
839589 842589 We went out in the parking<br />lot, so we had enormous trouble
842675 844218 getting all of these wind machines.
844302 847347 And then we had to blow<br />his hair to the same degree
847513 848681 because it had to match perfectly.
848765 851684 And so Christopher was now<br />in the studio delivering lines
851768 853978 battling against this<br />enormous wind machine
854062 855912 that we had blowing into his face.
857231 860025 This sequence was shot on the<br />wet set that… We call it the wet set
860109 861903 because it's wet, I guess.
862070 865156 It has water, but it's<br />basically a pile of sandbags
865323 867741 shaped like a big swimming<br />pool, and it was on a parking lot,
867825 870744 so we were standing on the<br />asphalt of a parking lot. We flooded it.
870828 874123 This was where we shot the outside<br />of the Mines of Moria, with that lake
874207 876834 where the monster attacks them<br />outside the entrance of the mine.
876918 879503 And we used it for the Dead<br />Marshes in <i>The Two Towers,</i>
879587 882215 and it also served as flooded Isengard.
882382 884882 So it was a really<br />worthwhile sort of set to build.
885885 889485 Some of the great lines that we<br />struggled so hard to keep in the movie
891307 894518 because they're so Tolkienesque<br />and delivered so brilliantly by the actors
894602 898689 and… "What is the house of Rohan but a<br />thatched barn?" All of that sort of thing.
898773 901442 Just wanna keep that incredible language,
901609 906948 but, really, unless it works dramatically<br />in the end, it's hard to justify.
907115 909865 I think you can feel it, though.<br />In the seven minutes
911702 911786 of watching this scene, that<br />it lacks of the dramatic shape.
911953 912954 I can feel it.
913121 915921 It's only because, to me, if<br />we had written this scene…
918167 919376 As the beginning of the movie,<br />and Peter had been able to shoot it
919460 922296 knowing this was going to<br />kick off <i>The Return of the King</i>
922380 924256 we would have done…<br />Made so many different choices.
924340 927540 It's… It's okay being in the<br />Extended Cut, because in a sense…
929595 931138 The existence of the Extended Cut<br />completes what's effectively a box set.
931222 933640 It's three movies. The end of one<br />film and the beginning of the next
933724 934974 becomes less relevant.
935059 937895 You haven't got a… A year gap between<br />the release of these films anymore.
937979 941023 You've now got them sitting on<br />your shelf as one complete set.
941107 943275 The placement of these scenes is…<br />Is actually less important
943359 945277 now that the whole<br />thing's together in one set.
945361 948489 But certainly, when we were looking<br />at these films being a year apart,
948573 951033 and what was in…<br />What was last year and what's this year
951117 953017 there were tough decisions to make.
957206 959625 Of course, Saruman's<br />death is also a variation,
959792 961842 and we wanted to acknowledge that here.
962003 965715 We… Even though we were resetting<br />what happens in the Shire to Isengard
965882 968092 in terms of changing the<br />book, we wanted to somehow
968176 969844 have the dynamic the same.
971471 975766 When I was shooting the stabbing<br />shot with Christopher, as a director would
975933 979603 I was explaining to him what he should<br />do when Wormtongue stabs him in the back
979687 981605 like sort of the air is<br />escaping out of you.
981689 985485 And he says, "Peter, have you<br />ever heard the sound a man makes
985651 988779 when he's stabbed in the back?"<br />And I said, "No."
988946 991949 And he says, "Well, I have.<br />I know what to do."
992116 994868 And, of course, when you<br />question him for more information
994952 997663 you find out that he's still<br />under the Official information Act
997747 1000582 the Secrecy Act, because he<br />was a commander in World War II.
1000666 1003293 And there were things happened with<br />Christopher that he's never talked about,
1003377 1004837 and he's not allowed to talk about.
1004921 1008591 He knew the sound of the<br />air escaping and the groan
1008758 1011219 the type of groan that is emitted.
1011761 1015765 And that's what you're actually getting<br />in this film, the authentic re-creation.
1021354 1023522 You know, the great thing with DVD<br />is then Christopher wasn't in the film…
1023606 1025691 You know, the great thing with DVD<br />is then Christopher wasn't in the film,
1025775 1029654 for a few months, and now<br />with the release of this DVD
1029820 1030904 he's back in there again,
1030988 1032533 and, I mean, these<br />will be ultimately seen
1032575 1034199 as the more definitive<br />versions of the film
1034283 1035785 I'm sure.
1039372 1041540 We do have an alternative<br />version of this scene.
1041624 1043542 We have stuff in this scene<br />that we still haven't used.
1043626 1046076 Again, it was about giving<br />the scene some tension.
1049465 1052634 …of revealing the truth behind<br />the death of Théodred to Théoden.
1052718 1056513 This is when the whole sequence was…<br />That was your idea, wasn't it, Franny?
1056597 1060393 When the sequence was closing<br />out Film Two, and we wanted it
1060560 1063896 to have some of that tension<br />and drama of a final denouement.
1064063 1067275 But the problem with that was<br />that that never really worked
1067441 1072113 because we didn't ultimately<br />care about Théodred,
1072280 1074907 or need to know who…<br />Who or what had killed him.
1075074 1077826 And by that stage we had<br />been away from Gríma too much
1077910 1080060 to really care too much about him either.
1085251 1088295 Mind you, by then, I'll be so<br />old that I will have forgotten
1088379 1092079 that we ever shot these movies, and<br />have no idea what we have left over.
1095011 1096220 -…the scouring of the Shire, wasn't it?<br />-Yes.
1096304 1097680 -Sharkey and…<br />-Yes.
1097847 1101497 -…the Hobbits encountering him.<br />-The… This was the basis of the scene.
1108941 1111941 This was a shot that was one<br />of the star shots in the reel…
1114363 1115663 Well, we ran it backwards.
1115823 1117115 We did, actually, it's back… Yeah.
1117199 1119576 And we had to paint out the<br />soldiers walking backwards.
1119660 1120911 That's right.
1121078 1123378 Because the original shot pulls out.<br />Didn't it?
1126375 1127209 …where it was, we<br />thought it had to push in…
1127293 1129545 -…otherwise it wasn't really working.<br />-To take you into the whole…
1129629 1132129 -Yeah, yeah.<br />-She was watching them leave in One,
1134091 1134967 and then watching<br />them arrive in this film.
1135051 1138201 This was actually a rebuilt<br />Edoras, because this entire party…
1140473 1143973 Didn't actually exist in our<br />original script and we'd never shot it.
1144101 1147312 And we had this giant, big set of<br />this Golden Hall that we had built.
1147396 1149022 Fortunately, when we<br />were done with shooting
1149106 1151984 we put it in storage, just in case.
1152151 1155529 We didn't throw it away, which<br />was lucky, because three years later
1155613 1157698 we kind of came up with<br />the idea of this banquet,
1157782 1159533 and we were able to<br />drag this bloody big set out,
1159617 1163579 and stick it in the warehouse<br />again, and we had it back for filming.
1163746 1167146 The drinking game was meant to<br />be a bit of leaven, really, wasn't it?
1169043 1170419 Just to lighten the front of this film.<br />That it's not all doom and gloom.
1170503 1172504 And Pete came up with<br />the idea of a drinking game.
1172588 1175738 Yeah. Drinking competitions are<br />a national sport in New Zealand.
1177718 1178135 I mean, if New Zealand was<br />running the Olympic Games
1178302 1179886 it would be one of the main events.
1179970 1183370 It was primarily an excuse for<br />putting Howard and Michael Semanick
1184266 1185866 in the back of shot. I think.
1189647 1192065 …is next to Howard Shore,<br />and we put wigs on them…
1192149 1194693 …we put them in there, we<br />made them sit around for hours…
1194777 1197029 …we shot them, and then<br />we cut them out of the film.
1197113 1202284 So it was a very sort of typical<br />experience as a movie extra.
1202451 1204453 They hit the cutting-room floor.
1204620 1206320 Yes, anyway, everybody's back now.
1206414 1208916 Everyone's got their<br />cameos back in this DVD.
1212044 1213712 The banquet sequence<br />is really a series of
1213754 1215464 setups, isn't it, for… For later things?
1215548 1218717 The only thing that isn't a setup<br />was the frivolous drinking game.
1218801 1222722 When the old, tough choices came<br />about what to include in the movie
1222888 1225140 that was the piece of the<br />scene that was expendable
1225224 1227768 in the sense of the narrative, because<br />we wanted to obviously establish
1227852 1229895 the relationship between<br />Éowyn and Aragorn.
1229979 1234191 We wanted to hint at Théoden's<br />lack of confidence about his abilities.
1234358 1237445 We wanted to establish<br />even the little glimpse
1237611 1240656 of Pippin being<br />distracted by the palantír,
1240823 1242407 and Gandalf thinking that<br />something might be up.
1242491 1244993 And we wanted to obviously have Gandalf<br />and Aragorn having the conversation
1245077 1246620 about Frodo and what's happened to him.
1246704 1249915 So we were able to establish<br />a whole lot of little story threads
1249999 1254837 in one sequence, that we<br />had already shot the later
1255337 1257589 you know, the later<br />stages of those story lines.
1257673 1261635 But we… We hadn't really felt that<br />we'd begun them that… That cleanly.
1261802 1264302 Actually, what we were<br />doing, too, was trying to…
1267057 1268141 Earn another scene that<br />was not put in the original
1268225 1270575 which is the scene<br />between Éowyn and Aragorn.
1277193 1278943 John just went kind of crazy there.
1282656 1285867 And that line, God knows where…<br />What that line… Where it came from or…
1285951 1288328 Oh, I can tell you.<br />You don't wanna know where it comes from.
1288412 1290039 -Tell me.<br />-It comes from <i>Jaws,</i>
1290206 1292750 and it comes from<br />Captain Quinton, who says:
1292917 1295711 "Here's to men who go swimming<br />with bow-legged women."
1295878 1297878 Oh, okay. Oh, that's where it came from.
1298339 1300339 Oh, okay. Oh, that's where it came from.
1301383 1303933 In drinking scenes in<br />movies, people often wonder…
1306722 1309307 Because it… Otherwise you'd have<br />actors rolling around on the floor.
1309391 1311476 And sometimes you do have actors<br />rolling around on the floor anyway.
1311560 1313771 In the movies we use a low-alcohol beer.
1313938 1317441 It's real beer, it's brewed with hops<br />and it tastes pretty much like beer,
1317525 1318817 but it's very low-alcohol.
1318901 1321904 We had a brewery in<br />Nelson actually create
1322071 1325366 a special low-alcohol Hobbit<br />beer for us to use in the film.
1329995 1332206 So where did that<br />drinking song come from?
1332373 1333206 Phil wrote it.
1339922 1340256 Full credit for the bad stuff!<br />I always write the drinking songs.
1340422 1342716 And Plan 9 did the music.
1345636 1348436 Hopefully people aren't concentrating.<br />But if you look…
1351016 1351267 At this very quiet conversation<br />between these two characters
1351433 1354436 you find out that… You'll hear that the…<br />The sound of the party
1354520 1356230 has suddenly died right down.
1356397 1360025 And it's one of those weird things that…<br />That happens when you're mixing the film
1360109 1362945 that you can have this loud.<br />Outrageous party
1363112 1366740 with everybody laughing and drinking,<br />and food and every… All the noises,
1366824 1368867 and then when you have<br />this quiet conversation
1368951 1371536 you obviously just can't<br />play those sorts of sounds.
1371620 1375040 And so you just push it all back, and it…<br />And it's sort of very artificial,
1375124 1377083 but there's no… No other way around it.
1377167 1381117 And you just hope that in the flow of<br />the film, people aren't thinking about it.
1386010 1390848 This sequence is like a sister<br />to the scene in <i>The Two Towers</i>
1391015 1392474 where Gollum talks to himself.
1392558 1394643 The irony is that this<br />one was shot first.
1394727 1396565 It was shot during our<br />principal photography
1396607 1398230 and it was shot for <i>Return of the King</i>
1398314 1401274 actually directed by Geoff Murphy.<br />And you were there too, weren't you. Fran?
1401358 1403652 -Yeah.<br />-And we'd liked the scene a lot,
1403819 1406238 but when…<br />In <i>The Two Towers</i> we thought we needed
1406322 1408240 an equivalent scene that<br />did a very similar thing.
1408324 1411118 So it…<br />The scene in <i>The Two Towers</i> was something
1411285 1414788 that Fran wrote and directed as<br />a setup for what would ultimately…
1414955 1417064 This was like the second beat in that…
1417106 1419418 In that… In his deterioration, wasn't it?
1419585 1422885 Yeah, although we did have two…<br />The two monologues in <i>Two Towers.</i>
1425007 1425174 We had the… The one right at the end
1425341 1427300 -the two-minute, you know, shot.<br />-Yeah, in the forest?
1427384 1428385 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
1428552 1430602 -So this was really the third one.<br />-Right.
1435434 1436565 …one of the very first sort of splittings
1436607 1437561 of the two characters originally…
1437645 1439396 …which, of course,<br />would have come too late…
1439480 1442691 …as we realized when we were<br />doing pickups on <i>Two Towers.</i>
1443692 1446945 But I have always loved the conceit<br />that you came up with, Pete, didn't you
1447029 1449630 when you, when we… At the very beginning,
1449672 1451700 of the… The image in the water.
1451867 1455267 Yeah, it's a little bit clichéd,<br />and it's a little bit unimaginative.
1457373 1458832 …where you have somebody just<br />cutting from different camera angles.
1458916 1463545 Having the old reflection talking to<br />yourself has been done before, hasn't it?
1468884 1472471 It's worth just mentioning, too,<br />that this is an improved Gollum
1472638 1475849 over the one that was in <i>Two Towers.</i><br />That between <i>The Two…</i>
1476016 1479269 After <i>Two Towers</i> was<br />finished, the Weta CG artist
1479436 1482522 did a lot of work on his face, and they<br />re-engineered some of the muscles,
1482606 1485650 and allowed him to actually<br />pull more subtle expressions
1485734 1487152 especially around his eyes,
1487236 1490322 and I think that Gollum's<br />performance in <i>Return of the King</i>
1490406 1494200 is actually better than <i>The Two Towers,</i><br />just because they were able to capture
1494284 1497663 what Andy was doing<br />with much more accuracy.
1501458 1505337 Well, we didn't really want to make this<br />just a… A copy of what people had seen
1505421 1507881 in <i>The Two Towers</i> earlier.<br />But I… I think it's nice
1507965 1511260 because it has a few<br />little interesting twists on it.
1511427 1516056 It really does play up the…<br />The argument between himself, doesn't it?
1516223 1518925 It's like in… Gollum warning Sméagol not
1518967 1521645 to get too excited. And it's kind of fun.
1528902 1532152 We worked a lot of this dialogue<br />up on the motion-capture stage…
1533782 1537232 Right, so it wasn't actually even<br />there on the day that you shot it…
1539079 1542124 -And Gollum was put in much later.<br />-Yes.
1545669 1548380 I mean, one of the things we had<br />to be a bit careful of in… In this film
1548464 1553719 was that the, you know, the relationship<br />between Sméagol and Frodo and Sam
1553886 1557722 can get one-note very quickly, kind of…<br />That you've basically got Sam saying:
1557806 1560517 "But he's out to kill us, he's<br />out to kill us." and Frodo saying:
1560601 1563395 "But he has to show us the way,"<br />and Gollum doing his own thing.
1563479 1565438 And we were sort of worried<br />that we were just gonna end up
1565522 1569818 with too many scenes that were<br />basically playing that same story beat.
1569985 1571485 -Well, we did, actually.<br />-Yeah.
1575157 1576908 In terms of… And that's why, I think, the
1576950 1578618 foot of the stairs didn't go in, did it,
1578702 1580454 -for that reason?<br />-No.
1580621 1582664 Well, it's in the Extended Cut.
1585125 1589004 That Sméagol is a little bit more devious<br />than even Gollum understands or knows.
1589088 1591888 Sméagol wasn't the…<br />The simpleton that he comes across.
1594551 1597721 He had his own little agenda to even<br />try to outsmart his own… His alter ego.
1597805 1601600 Yeah. This is a kind of nice<br />idea to build that complexity into it.
1606814 1606855 "Sméagol promised. Sméagol lied."
1607022 1609733 -Oh, yeah.<br />-That actually he was
1609900 1612152 a pretty dark character<br />and wasn't the cute character
1612236 1614613 that everyone had fallen in love with.
1614780 1618130 I love the look that Gollum gives here.<br />It's a beautiful expression.
1620202 1623496 I love the look that Gollum gives here.<br />It's a beautiful expression.
1623580 1628836 Really, the villainy of <i>Return of<br />the King</i> commences with Pippin
1629002 1633340 having his encounter with the<br />palantír in the Edoras sleeping quarters.
1633507 1636157 That, you know…<br />That's Sauron's emergence of this…
1636260 1638178 In this film as the villain.
1638345 1643892 And we felt, that's really where<br />the force of evil starts in… In this film.
1647104 1649954 The film was gonna start<br />with the camera rushing across
1650065 1652317 from the Paths of the Dead<br />and crashing into Aragorn
1652401 1653902 who wakes up out of a nightmare.
1653986 1658115 And then he steps out of<br />the room, and this is literally
1658282 1662411 the first sort of scene in the<br />movie, how it was gonna open.
1662578 1665330 Of course, the irony was, was that<br />it didn't end up in the movie at all.
1665414 1668333 -Yeah.<br />-But it's a beautiful scene.
1671587 1673937 This is about a woman<br />who has never been able…
1677050 1679094 And that her powerlessness that<br />she actually sees, stood on the brink,
1679178 1682264 but she was powerless to do<br />something, and she's looking…
1682431 1684474 What I like about what<br />Miranda does in here
1684558 1687227 is she's looking to him for an answer.
1687394 1689646 But actually, he can't give it to her.
1693692 1695950 It was a real dream,<br />wasn't it, of Tolkien's?
1695992 1696942 Yes, that's right.
1699114 1700532 Yes, and that's where his<br />idea for Númenor came from.
1700616 1701867 That's right.
1702034 1703952 -Being consumed by the sea.<br />-That's right.
1704036 1706997 -Yeah. Like an Atlantis dream.<br />-It was.
1707164 1709291 -It's from her.<br />-The dream?
1709458 1710708 No, it's Faramir's dream.
1714963 1717298 In fact, he thought Faramir<br />may in fact have been himself
1717382 1718758 when he entered into the story.
1718842 1721928 And one of the things he gave to<br />Faramir was his dream of Númenor.
1722012 1725431 I… I'm not a dream person, but to<br />me it means a sense of powerlessness.
1725515 1727600 And certainly, looking at his<br />childhood you can understand
1727684 1729603 where that would have come from.
1730729 1735484 Always, we wanted to establish the<br />intimacy between Aragorn and Éowyn.
1735651 1738153 And you don't have much<br />time in the film to do it.
1738320 1740697 We wanted to build to the<br />moment where she takes
1740781 1744493 her own destiny in her hands<br />and says, "I'm going to fight."
1745202 1748452 The little moment that happens<br />here between Legolas and Aragorn…
1750582 1753794 Where it was a pickup, but we<br />didn't have Viggo and Orlando
1753961 1755921 in the country at the same time.
1757631 1760842 Orlando was shot first with<br />nobody, and then Viggo was shot
1761009 1764304 against a blue screen and<br />superimposed over the top of the shot.
1764388 1765818 So when they're looking<br />at each other there.
1765860 1767265 They're just looking<br />at marks on the wall.
1767349 1770060 They were shot about<br />three or four months apart.
1775023 1775973 -…in the sky.<br />-Oh.
1779486 1779528 Well, maybe some stars are veiled.<br />The ones that really count.
1779695 1781595 It might not have been a literal line.
1783865 1783941 Are you saying it's…
1783983 1784199 Did that not occur to you, that we write…
1784366 1786075 -No.<br />-…figuratively as well as literally?
1786159 1789246 So you think, metaphorically,<br />the stars are veiled.
1791415 1793371 There was a tiny reference that Tolkien
1793413 1795615 did to Gandalf sleeping<br />with his eyes open,
1796878 1798796 and so I really wanted to…<br />To see that in the movie,
1798880 1801800 and we had our opportunity<br />here with this scene.
1801967 1806012 I just think it's so wonderfully bizarre<br />and weird that he's kind of sleeping there
1806096 1809891 with his… I think people think he's<br />dead the first time they see him.
1810058 1813478 -Where did you shoot this, Pete?<br />-C stage.
1813562 1816231 -Yeah, it was.<br />-Yeah. A long time ago.
1816398 1818566 Oh. For some reason I thought<br />we shot it in Queenstown.
1818650 1820300 I thought you shot it in Methven.
1820986 1823236 I think we built the<br />set for it down south…
1826158 1828243 So we only went inside if it<br />was raining, and it didn't rain,
1828327 1830912 so we ended up shooting it<br />up in Stone Street Studios.
1830996 1834207 I remember the day we shot it, actually.
1834374 1837710 Kind of an awkward little scene to<br />shoot, because the set's kind of small,
1837794 1840088 and we also had real<br />issues with the scale.
1840255 1842757 It's not so much early on,<br />but once everybody wakes up,
1842841 1844801 and starts running around.<br />You've got these two Hobbits,
1844885 1848513 and the big people in the room,<br />and I remember we… Us… It's…
1848680 1850932 There's all sorts of<br />little cheats happen.
1859858 1864613 This was an important moment for<br />us, because it is our sort of opportunity
1864780 1868492 to establish Sauron<br />as the villain of this film
1868658 1872245 the way that he's now a<br />presence with the palantír.
1873789 1876792 We had a whole idea of<br />going into Pippin's head
1876958 1879544 while he's holding the<br />palantír, and seeing him inside
1879628 1882028 some sort of a cage,<br />didn't we, in Sauron's…
1882130 1885550 So it's some sort of metaphysical<br />representation of what he's seeing.
1885717 1888052 But at the end of the<br />day it was just too tricky
1888136 1891973 to kind of try to dramatize that,<br />so we sort of stayed outside of it
1892140 1895394 as it were, and just sort of saw<br />what was happening to Pippin.
1895685 1898335 I was very interested to see<br />what Gandalf wore to bed.
1901233 1904833 What… What is he wearing? Is it<br />like a sort of under robe or something?
1905445 1907572 -He doesn't have pajamas, does he?<br />-No, it's just his underclothes.
1907656 1909914 It's kind of quite Chinese-y.<br />It's sort of got
1909956 1912206 trousers and that sort<br />of smocky thing and…
1912369 1915719 Well, he's a kind of a…<br />He's a groovy dude, isn't he? He's kind…
1917666 1919584 That's right, seeing Gan…<br />You don't actually associate Gandalf
1919668 1922796 with lying in bed, do you, in…<br />In his… In his jammies?
1922963 1924506 But here we… Here we are.
1928802 1930703 This was all kind of tricky.<br />This was… The
1930745 1932555 shots like this we did with Big Paul's…
1932639 1935016 Where you're looking at Billy Boyd,
1935183 1938186 and we had to have these big hands,<br />because obviously Gandalf's hands are…
1938270 1940730 So we found the biggest<br />hands that we possibly could
1940814 1944818 which were Big Paul's hands,<br />this big 7-and-a-half-foot-tall guy.
1944985 1947435 And…<br />And so Ian would give him instruction
1947477 1949573 of how he wanted his fingers to move.
1949739 1953284 And would… Actually, often, I would<br />have the actors direct their doubles
1953368 1957080 because they sort of knew what<br />they wanted to do better than I did.
1962461 1965411 …which tells Gandalf exactly<br />where Sauron is gonna strike.
1970343 1970594 Where is he gonna strike?<br />And obviously the answer is Minas Tirith.
1970760 1973471 But we didn't want Gandalf to<br />have that knowledge straightaway
1973555 1976015 because otherwise there's basically<br />no drama at the beginning of the film.
1976099 1980020 So we sort of back-engineered a mystery,<br />which was, "Where is he gonna strike?"
1980187 1984107 We tried to engineer that with Saruman,<br />and then this is another beat, isn't it?
1984191 1986526 And then we actually did a bit<br />of dialogue in this scene as well.
1986610 1987903 Yep.
1990530 1991989 This was originally two scenes.
1992073 1994659 In the movie that we shot<br />three or four years ago
1994826 1997226 we opened on the scene<br />that you're seeing now.
1997329 2000706 Then we went… Halfway through it,<br />they were talking about Frodo and Sam,
2000790 2003709 and we went to the scene in the culvert,<br />where they're lying in the culvert,
2003793 2006629 and, you know, the earthquake happens<br />and Gollum, and then we come back
2006713 2008339 to the conclusion of this scene.
2008423 2010386 But the editing of<br />this movie, inevitably,
2010428 2012385 all of these little connections and plans
2012469 2015096 that you have get thrown out<br />once you start cutting it together.
2015180 2017480 And we ended up<br />collapsing this scene into one.
2017641 2019600 And we actually had to flip shots around.
2019684 2022437 Guys were looking in the<br />wrong direction at the wrong time,
2022521 2026471 and we had to flip shots left to right<br />so that they got their eye-line right.
2026608 2030237 We even actually played one of<br />Ian McKellen's shots backwards.
2030403 2033532 Because we had a shot where<br />he was walking towards Aragorn.
2033698 2036033 We wanted to have him<br />walking away from Aragorn,
2036117 2038411 and the only way we could<br />figure it was to play it in reverse,
2038495 2041372 and hope that people wouldn't notice<br />that it was being played backwards.
2041456 2043207 It was a tricky little scene.<br />It shouldn't be tricky,
2043291 2047241 and it doesn't look tricky, but it was<br />a bloody nightmare to put it together.
2056846 2060296 Our biggest problem here was that<br />Pippin had looked into the palantír.
2062143 2064061 We didn't want to make Gandalf<br />taking him to Minas Tirith the big issue.
2064145 2066273 Gandalf has to get Pippin out of there
2066439 2068608 because really the story's<br />not about that by now.
2068692 2070651 It's about warning the<br />people of Minas Tirith.
2070735 2073113 But we also had to<br />get Pippin with Gandalf.
2073280 2076324 That was always a sticky,<br />sticky thing to get through.
2084332 2086882 I was always amused at<br />the dog that crossed twice
2088837 2089004 in the background in the wide shots.
2089671 2093021 Well, Rohan… Well, Rohan had a<br />whole dog-trainer program going on.
2094926 2095927 They're one of the few<br />places in Middle-earth
2096011 2098888 that really, you know, had<br />instigated that particular program.
2098972 2100307 Yeah.
2100765 2103351 An MP from Parliament<br />came on the day we shot this.
2103518 2105895 We built Edoras in conservation land.
2106062 2108606 You know, it was built on a very<br />protected area of New Zealand
2108690 2112276 that we had to be very careful with the<br />impact on the environment and things.
2112360 2116531 And so it was good to… To… To have<br />members of Parliament coming along,
2116698 2118699 and being able to show them that we were
2118783 2121369 trying to be as careful<br />as we possibly could.
2127917 2130795 …between these two, and that<br />Merry's frustration and anxiousness…
2130879 2132797 …because he understands<br />and knows, of course…
2132881 2134799 …that Pippin is going<br />to be taken from him.
2134883 2137886 And we actually wanted<br />them to not part on good terms.
2143016 2145851 …with the separation.<br />Not have it just be, "Oh, bye-bye."
2145935 2148145 "I'll see you later, you know,<br />good luck," sort of thing.
2148229 2152067 We wanted it to actually have a<br />more emotional separation than that.
2152609 2154709 That's the look between<br />Gandalf and Merry.
2157530 2159908 This is part of Pippin's<br />story, was to grow up.
2160075 2162577 He's still, at the beginning<br />of this story, acting as the…
2162661 2166581 As the curious, careless young Hobbit.
2166748 2170835 And part of his journey, of course, is…<br />is to maturity.
2173546 2175846 That guard they rushed<br />past there was Big Paul.
2178802 2179677 And it's the only time in the movies<br />that Big Paul gets his face actually seen.
2179761 2181887 This shot's a little tricky,<br />because you're seeing
2181971 2183723 the small version of Merry running
2183807 2185683 who is the 4-foot-high scale double.
2185767 2188478 And then we had Dominic<br />Monaghan on his knees
2188645 2190980 waiting for the scale double<br />to get around the corner.
2191064 2194864 And then without cutting the camera,<br />we had Dom popping up in the foreground.
2195193 2198093 And this scene was really<br />also about the fact that Merry…
2200490 2201490 Has always taken<br />responsibility for Pippin.
2201574 2204452 And now he's actually<br />powerless to do anything.
2206996 2208946 -So you never put in Legolas' poem?<br />-No.
2209499 2210125 -So you never put in Legolas' poem?<br />-No.
2210291 2212376 We put his poem back in<br />for the Paths of the Dead.
2212460 2214337 -Yeah, but to Treebeard…<br />-But we didn't put it back in here.
2214421 2217382 No, no. No, because it<br />wasn't linked into this scene.
2218299 2220885 There's another little deleted<br />moment where Legolas and Treebeard
2220969 2222887 have a conversation<br />about the Elves leaving
2222971 2226474 which we shot, but we never used it.<br />Because it was originally going to cut
2226558 2228184 directly from that conversation
2228268 2231855 to Liv and the Elves on<br />their way through the forest.
2232021 2236192 But because in the editing of the<br />film, the two moments from Isengard
2236359 2239654 to here got separated by<br />all of the Edoras sequence
2239821 2243199 it was no longer a<br />very useful thing to do.
2243450 2246850 We also wanted to signal the fact<br />that this world was going to end…
2248830 2251165 And that's the knowledge<br />of Treebeard and Legolas
2251249 2255086 that there's not going to be room in<br />the world for these creatures anymore.
2255170 2258047 Great moment for the 25th<br />anniversary edition, if I can remember…
2258131 2259215 -Okay.<br />-…to put it in.
2259299 2261050 -Can you remind me?<br />-Just write it down.
2261134 2263344 The sooner you remind me…<br />Just remind me in about 20 years,
2263428 2265728 so that I can start<br />thinking about it again.
2269684 2273084 This was originally, again, a<br />possibility of being in <i>The Two Towers.</i>
2274981 2276357 One of the things that we<br />came to with Arwen's story
2276441 2279444 is that we had written the<br />fact that she was leaving
2279611 2281696 that she was going to<br />leave and forsake Aragorn.
2281780 2284448 And we had written ourselves to<br />the point of, "Why would she stay?"
2284532 2287159 And I remember Fran and I,<br />one morning, trying to figure out:
2287243 2288693 "Why the hell does she stay?"
2288787 2291330 And we came up with the<br />idea that she stayed for the child
2291414 2293332 because we know she does have a child
2293416 2295626 that this was her one<br />chance to be a mother.
2295710 2297295 That is beautiful.
2301966 2304666 That little boy is called…<br />His name is Sadwyn Brophy.
2307138 2307597 He's a wonderful, wonderful actor.
2307764 2310809 -Five years old and such fantastic focus.<br />-Yeah.
2310975 2317732 He's the son of Jed, who has<br />taken various roles in the three films.
2317899 2320401 So it was lovely to… To have him.
2328827 2330977 That was Fidwick, isn't it?<br />What's his name?
2331871 2332580 -Fidw… Fidwit? What was his…<br />-No, Figwit.
2332747 2334040 -Figwit.<br />-Figwit, yeah.
2334207 2337042 Yeah. And that was actually<br />put in just for fun for the fans
2337126 2339170 because we didn't even<br />know about this character.
2339254 2340588 I can't even pronounce his name.
2340672 2344509 And yet this guy was<br />created by the fans, really.
2344676 2349097 He was an extra in the Council<br />of Elrond scene in <i>Fellowship,</i>
2349264 2352224 and so much fuss had been made<br />about him over the last couple of years
2352308 2354310 that we had this moment<br />where we wanted Arwen
2354394 2357605 to just have this, you know, just this<br />brief moment with an anonymous Elf.
2357689 2360107 We thought, "Well, rather than making…<br />Make him anonymous
2360191 2362527 let's make him Fig… Figwit."
2362694 2364028 -Figwit.<br />-Figwit. What?
2364195 2365695 "Frodo is Great. Who is That?"
2366114 2367614 "Frodo is Great. Who is That?"
2372829 2375829 The conflict here is that her<br />father knew about this child…
2378084 2378918 And yet he was still…<br />To save her life, he was still prepared
2379002 2385258 to sacrifice the possibility of there<br />being a child born of Arwen and Aragorn.
2387677 2391177 These two scenes of her in the<br />forest and then coming back to Elrond…
2393057 2393725 And they were gonna be in <i>The Two Towers,</i>
2393892 2397394 but we felt it was better to leave<br />the story line unresolved in that film,
2397478 2399063 and actually resolve it in this one.
2399147 2402566 God, this movie inherited a… A hell<br />of a lot of <i>Two Towers</i> stuff, didn't it?
2402650 2403859 -Yeah, we did.<br />-It could be called
2403943 2406154 <i>The Two Towers Part Two.</i>
2407780 2409740 But it's better.<br />I mean, it's one of those great…
2409824 2412409 I love that organic process<br />of, you know, making films.
2412493 2414286 Especially when…<br />When you're dealing with…
2414370 2416370 -Sorry.<br />-Well, no, you're dealing with…
2419626 2419918 Yeah, the "organic<br />process of filmmaking."
2420084 2422634 As opposed to the "chaotic<br />and cataclysmic process"?
2423588 2425488 It's organized confusion, basically…
2428885 2432013 And it morphs itself into another plan.
2432180 2435099 And somewhere you just hope<br />that one of these plans is good.
2435183 2437135 -That's called "desperation."
2437177 2440271 -Not necessarily… Not necessarily always…
2440355 2441605 but sometimes you get lucky.
2441689 2444817 We sort of cut this together<br />as a much tighter sequence
2444984 2448988 which allowed us the opportunity just<br />to tell the story through several scenes.
2449072 2452075 And so we did…<br />We did trim some of these scenes slightly.
2452241 2454491 I love those tiles.<br />We should use those tiles.
2458206 2459218 The Elves had good taste.
2459260 2461125 They're just a bit of old…<br />Old custom wood.
2461209 2462042 -Are they?<br />-Yeah.
2465088 2467138 -The library? No, well, I didn't…<br />-Yeah.
2472261 2474138 …the mythic library scene.<br />You see, we won't say anything more.
2474222 2476891 We'll just hint at it and not tell them<br />what actually happens in the library.
2476975 2479425 -They can find out in…<br />-It's in honor of Fran…
2482814 2484481 -Don't say anything.<br />-They're heading on the Internet.
2484565 2486108 Don't say anything<br />about the library scene.
2486192 2487360 -Okay.<br />-No.
2487527 2489570 Okay, nobody mention the library.
2489737 2492637 What we really need to do is<br />orchestrate some lost footage.
2493324 2495618 It needs to go missing,<br />and then it can be found…
2495702 2497902 Oh, you mean like the<br />spider scene from <i>Kong?</i>
2502041 2505253 And then we could find<br />it again in about 20 years.
2505878 2509882 The shots of Hugo staring here.<br />He was actually looking at the painting
2510049 2511884 of the Last Alliance when we shot it.
2511968 2515554 But we decided to make it look like he<br />was looking at the forging of the sword.
2515638 2517681 It was a nice intense<br />close-up of him that we had,
2517765 2522270 and we felt it was more useful<br />to us at this particular moment.
2527692 2528734 But we thought that was very undramatic.
2528818 2531818 We probably spoke about this<br />in the commentary two years ago.
2535783 2537130 …will probably have<br />heard all that before.
2537172 2538160 Right. Don't repeat yourself…
2538244 2540371 -…is that what you're saying?<br />-Well, you can repeat yourself…
2540455 2542373 …and you always do repeat yourself, but…
2542457 2545793 But, you know, you don't<br />necessarily have to… Have to put the…
2545960 2548963 These people are listening to 11<br />and a half hours of commentary,
2549047 2551090 and they don't need to<br />hear the same thing twice.
2551174 2552884 Okay.
2562143 2564201 The ride of Gandalf<br />to Minas Tirith is one
2564243 2566393 of those great icons<br />in the book, isn't it?
2566481 2568482 I remember John Howe<br />did a beautiful painting of it.
2568566 2571819 And John Mahaffie directed<br />most of those galloping shots
2571986 2574488 which are very…<br />They're beautiful and it was nice.
2574572 2576528 And I love this sequence, too, of Gandalf
2576570 2578617 thundering up the<br />streets of Minas Tirith.
2578701 2582038 You know, I wanted it to be<br />a musical crescendo moment
2582205 2584457 a moment for Howard to just let rip.
2584624 2587960 And also to show the size of the city.<br />Because the design of the city
2588044 2589775 is just one of those wonderful winding
2589817 2591964 streets that go higher<br />and higher up the hill.
2592048 2594498 And it was a chance…<br />Because, in a movie, you…
2594592 2597261 Once you get locked into<br />dialogue and people are talking,
2597345 2600097 and this plot's unfolding,<br />you are just pushing along,
2600181 2603517 and you don't have a chance to really…<br />To indulge in this sort of thing.
2603601 2605728 But early in the movie<br />I just wanted to say:
2605812 2608897 "Let's have a scene that's about the city.<br />That's not about the story.
2608981 2612026 It's just about this great locale."
2612193 2614793 So I was really pleased<br />that we were able to do that.
2618282 2619782 Oh, the bloody old White Tree.
2623704 2623871 That was a difficult one to get in.<br />The White Tree and what it stood for.
2624038 2627188 Yeah. We didn't… We never<br />really quite nailed it in the movie.
2629210 2633131 But it's there, and it should be there,<br />and we just balls it up a little bit.
2633297 2635216 -We did it as best we could.<br />-Yeah.
2635383 2638635 It was one of those details where<br />ultimately the film can't sustain
2638719 2641513 all of that information that<br />Tolkien put into the books.
2641597 2643891 You can't explain everything, and you…
2644058 2645976 -We just never really found a way to.<br />-We tried!
2646060 2650606 We tried and failed, but we never<br />really figured out how the White Tree
2650773 2651982 is important to the movie.
2652066 2654652 Because in a way it's<br />not important in our movie.
2660408 2662910 This was one of the<br />biggest sets that we built.
2663077 2667456 And it was actually built in a…<br />A tin shed down on the docks.
2667623 2670667 And all of the original soundtrack…<br />Because what you're listening to here
2670751 2673796 is not original, it's all added,<br />the dialogue is added later.
2673880 2677680 But the original soundtrack, you can<br />actually hear the sound of… Of trains.
2677842 2680010 Because right outside there<br />was a big container wharf,
2680094 2683180 and there were these trains that<br />were running backwards and forwards
2683264 2686141 with containers, loading them<br />on and off, and shunting engines.
2686225 2688925 And it was as noisy as<br />all hell, but it was actually…
2689020 2693191 It was the biggest warehouse we<br />could find in the Wellington area.
2693357 2696610 And… And it's the only place<br />we could actually fit this set into
2696694 2699614 because it was a fairly huge build.
2699780 2702074 And it was also one of the<br />last things that we ever shot.
2702158 2705453 I… I remember these days<br />that we were filming Denethor
2705620 2710416 was our last… Probably the last four<br />or five weeks of principal photography
2710583 2712126 in December 2000.
2712293 2716130 So I always look at this stuff and I<br />just remember how exhausted I was.
2716923 2722261 I was almost falling over with<br />tiredness when this stuff was being done.
2724931 2728893 Sean's fantastic. It's so compelling.
2729060 2730510 We could have kept using him.
2730645 2733897 All the… The women who lusted after<br />Sean Bean were called Beanstalkers.
2733981 2736066 -Yes, that's right.<br />-There were a few of them on our crew.
2736150 2737526 -Yes.<br />-Philippa possibly being
2737610 2739820 -the queen of the Beanstalkers.<br />-No, I wasn't.
2739904 2741322 I was restrained.
2741489 2743199 Yeah.
2745493 2747995 John Noble is a really interesting actor.
2748162 2751249 He is someone that, you<br />know, is not very well-known
2751415 2753500 just from the mere fact<br />he hasn't made many films.
2753584 2756587 But he's a very experienced<br />stage actor in Australia.
2756754 2759173 And Denethor is a very<br />Shakespearean character,
2759340 2760924 and John's done a lot of Shakespeare.
2761008 2764303 And when we auditioned him, he<br />was making the lines come to life,
2764387 2768015 and giving them meaning in a<br />way that I'd never heard before.
2768182 2770643 You know, I could… The…<br />The archaic language
2770810 2772352 was suddenly making sense to me
2772436 2775230 because he was putting all<br />the emphasis on the right words,
2775314 2777691 and delivering it in such a…<br />A wonderful way.
2777775 2779985 And that's one of the reasons<br />why I wanted to cast him
2780069 2783769 was that I just… I just loved his<br />interpretation of… Of that language.
2785533 2787576 We also didn't want to put a beard on him
2787660 2789369 because I think when you read the book
2789453 2791580 he's even described as<br />having a beard in the book.
2791664 2794291 But we just ended up with<br />so many people with beards,
2794375 2798671 so many old guys in positions<br />of authority having long beards
2798838 2801882 that we actually made a conscious<br />decision to have Denethor clean-shaven.
2801966 2805720 Just to separate him from Gandalf.<br />From Saruman, from Théoden.
2811934 2814234 And of course he's not<br />sitting on the throne…
2817398 2817898 He's sitting at the foot of the<br />throne in the chair of the steward.
2818065 2821415 Yeah, I've always loved the steward idea.<br />The idea of the steward…
2823404 2825781 That's what you face when you're<br />making movies, is just these little things
2825865 2828200 which, sort of, you take<br />for granted in a book,
2828284 2829785 but, you know, how do you describe
2829869 2831995 without stopping the<br />story dead in its tracks?
2832079 2835082 How do you describe the<br />concept of what a steward is
2835249 2836959 as opposed to a king?
2837126 2838679 And I… You know, it was the little
2838721 2840671 challenges like that<br />that were ultimately…
2840755 2842172 Some of those were the most<br />annoying things, weren't they
2842256 2843382 when we were writing it?
2843466 2848137 It was… It was just trying to<br />not grind the story to a halt
2848304 2850890 to get some of these<br />fundamental ideas across.
2867448 2870450 A lot of this scene was done with<br />Ian McKellen by himself, of course
2870534 2871994 then we shot Billy Boyd
2872286 2875456 against a blue screen much<br />later and composited him in.
2875623 2878501 So Ian had to be looking<br />down at an invisible Pippin
2878667 2881003 whenever he was reacting to Pippin.
2885966 2888594 The history of Gondor<br />was something that I'm…
2888761 2890387 Actually got quite fascinated about,
2890471 2893432 and I think it's an interesting<br />part of the back-story,
2893599 2896227 but very difficult to use in the movie.
2896394 2900314 And we did shoot this…<br />This lecture that Gandalf gives to Pippin.
2900481 2903359 Didn't really use much<br />of it in the theatrical cut.
2903526 2906069 You know, and it's not<br />hugely relevant to the story,
2906153 2908853 but I do love the language that…<br />That Tolkien used.
2919166 2922419 This shot here is possibly one<br />of my favorite shots in the movie
2922503 2924463 which never made it<br />into the theatrical cut.
2924547 2926423 And hardly any of this really existed.
2926507 2928425 I just think it's ended<br />up being so majestic,
2928509 2931178 and I'm thrilled to actually see the<br />shot, to tell you the truth, finished
2931262 2934306 at last after about four years<br />of being in development.
2934473 2935306 It's lovely.
2939770 2940854 Traveling around and…
2940938 2943440 -It's all right. What's wrong with that?<br />-No, no, just needed it.
2943524 2946424 -But we're back with our actors. Ian…<br />-Eight more frames.
2949989 2952739 I could have traveled a bit<br />further down the other side.
2953492 2955744 It's all to do with traveling<br />down the other side.
2955828 2958247 -It is, really.<br />-Getting to the other side.
2959248 2961917 I'm glad this shot's back in there.<br />I quite like it.
2966255 2970050 I was always intrigued in the book,<br />the proximity of Minas Tirith to Mordor.
2970217 2972302 I always liked the idea that<br />Mordor seemed to be this place
2972386 2974513 that was so far away, that<br />everyone was trying to get to,
2974597 2977641 and yet the city is kind of<br />just, like, right in front of it.
2977725 2979726 And I was always looking<br />forward to <i>Return of the King</i>
2979810 2982687 to actually visualize that.<br />Because it's right on the front lines.
2982771 2986025 And there's just this<br />creepy mountain ridge.
2986192 2988568 And everything that was<br />happening to Frodo and Sam
2988652 2990112 is happening just over there.
2990196 2992280 And that's one of the good<br />things with this movie is that
2992364 2996911 even though Frodo and Sam don't<br />get to, you know, to physically interact
2997077 2999527 with our other characters<br />until the very end
2999622 3002416 you… You…<br />You have a proximity between characters
3002500 3004251 that we haven't had<br />in the earlier movies.
3004335 3007003 And so you have Gandalf and<br />Pippin talking about Frodo and Sam,
3007087 3010508 and you know that they<br />are over there somewhere
3010674 3012134 in those mountains<br />that they're looking at.
3012218 3014845 And that was always, I thought,<br />a useful thing for our story.
3014929 3017529 It was also the tension<br />of, will the Rohirrim arrive?
3018349 3018390 It was also the tension<br />of, will the Rohirrim arrive?
3018724 3020309 Will they come?
3030945 3034445 This was a little scene that Fran<br />directed, this scene, during pickups.
3034990 3037740 Yes. Yes, it was a cold day<br />and we were chasing the sun.
3040412 3042262 -Freezing on that…<br />-It was horrible.
3047461 3049911 I always looked on this<br />scene as being a mirror…
3052800 3054684 "If I take one more<br />step, I will go further
3054726 3056428 from home than I've ever gone before."
3056512 3059223 -Yeah.<br />-And… And Frodo encourages him.
3059390 3062518 And here, in the third<br />movie, the roles are reversed,
3062685 3065270 and it's Frodo that can't<br />make that step forward,
3065354 3067064 and Sam has to support him.
3067231 3070233 And that was really the way that<br />this scene was deliberately designed
3070317 3072069 to mirror the earlier one.
3077825 3079910 The day that we shot the<br />statue was a different day.
3079994 3082162 This is back in our original<br />shoot now four years ago,
3082246 3085207 and Sir Edmund Hillary,<br />the Everest mountaineer
3085374 3089211 the man who conquered<br />Everest in 1953, he came on set,
3089378 3092088 and we were shooting this scene<br />with Sir Edmund watching us.
3092172 3093772 Oh, he came to visit me as well.
3094800 3095968 -Yeah?<br />-We had Howard.
3096135 3098678 -It was Howard's first visit.<br />-Yeah, Howard Shore was there as well.
3098762 3099763 -Yeah. Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
3099930 3102474 And Howard was with us<br />and Sir Edmund came by.
3102641 3105185 -Yeah.<br />-I was shooting with Liv that day.
3108606 3112106 Sean Astin and Elijah Wood were<br />incredibly impressed with Ed Hillary…
3114111 3115362 Just because he is one of the<br />most famous explorers, you know.
3115446 3118323 He… He's achieved something<br />that is obviously so historic.
3118407 3122286 And his face appears on our $5<br />note, the New Zealand $5 note.
3122453 3124412 So I remember scrambling<br />around in my wallet
3124496 3127146 to give Elijah and Sean<br />$5 so they could get him
3127291 3129000 -to sign the note for them.<br />-Oh, that's cool.
3129084 3131670 And I… Fortunately, I did<br />have some $5 notes on me.
3131754 3135090 So I remember giving it to them<br />so they could get his autograph.
3135257 3136607 But that… That's illegal.
3137009 3138510 What, to deface money?
3138844 3141471 -Well, yeah, that's…<br />-They can sue them, arrest them.
3141555 3144892 Yeah, well, that's Frodo<br />and Sam what did it.
3145726 3149730 -Nothing to do with you.<br />-I was only the supplier of the cash.
3154610 3156760 This was always an<br />important scene for me…
3159990 3160824 Because it was an opportunity<br />to connect Frodo and Sam
3160908 3164160 directly with other characters. In this<br />case, obviously, Pippin and Gandalf.
3164244 3169291 And I love the way that the conversation<br />is about where Frodo and Sam are.
3169458 3172211 And you… We intercut between the two.
3172378 3174629 And somehow there's a<br />feeling that Gandalf knows.
3174713 3177049 He can feel that… Where they are.
3177216 3179176 Yeah, no, no, no, I agree.
3182971 3185974 Shots like this one were just done<br />with Ian McKellen standing on a box
3186058 3189352 a couple of feet higher than normal,<br />and we had the camera over his shoulder
3189436 3191980 looking down at Billy Boyd, and<br />Billy was just walking on the ground,
3192064 3195317 and Ian was on a box, and it's<br />amazing what you can get away with.
3195401 3199780 We… We figured out so many<br />simple tricks to cheat the scale.
3203492 3205953 Like this shot here has<br />Billy Boyd on his knees.
3206120 3208920 He's simply kneeling with<br />his elbows up on the railing,
3209039 3210415 and Ian standing behind him.
3210499 3212667 There's no special effect<br />here, it's just the two actors
3212751 3215003 shot at the same time,<br />and we just said to Billy:
3215087 3218187 "Just kneel down and suddenly<br />you'll become the Hobbit height."
3221468 3225018 We started to focus the storytelling<br />around this as a catalyst moment…
3226765 3227099 We started to focus the storytelling<br />around this as a catalyst moment,
3227266 3228666 for the beginning of war.
3228767 3232479 And… And to us it was very important<br />to get to this moment reasonably quickly.
3232563 3236442 It had been set up, discussed,<br />the story was moving towards it,
3236608 3239458 and we… We knew that we<br />needed to actually begin it,
3239570 3243490 and that we could spark it off<br />the balcony scene, the march out.
3243657 3245575 So that, in fact, the<br />mechanics of the story
3245659 3248078 were actually starting to kind of…<br />To get into motion.
3248162 3251289 Because otherwise there was a<br />danger of endless sort of dithering about,
3251373 3253792 but nothing actually beginning.
3259590 3260591 Oh, cameo.
3267514 3268015 It's Captain Pagwash.
3268348 3269683 Oh, that's terrible.
3269850 3271800 Oh, dear, oh, dear, there's no respect.
3275355 3275689 …that's coming up later<br />in this extended edition.
3275856 3279443 It's, like, back to its full glory.
3283864 3285240 That was really something<br />we did in pickups.
3285324 3288535 We really built the<br />Witch-king up in a way.
3288702 3291454 We always had the scene where<br />Éowyn kills him on the battlefield
3291538 3295166 which happens much later, obviously,<br />but we never really had much early stuff
3295250 3298400 with the Witch-king preparing<br />for the attack on Minas Tirith.
3298545 3302174 And so all of these sequences<br />with him were ones that we added
3302591 3304510 during post-production.
3304676 3307221 The Witch-king was<br />identified, really, by us
3307387 3309556 as one of our principal villains<br />of this film, because, again
3309640 3311307 we have the same old<br />bloody problem with Sauron
3311391 3315646 is that he's a flaming eye, and he can't<br />make any sort of physical appearance.
3315813 3318314 And it was always a problem,<br />and we obviously did, at some point
3318398 3320275 think about having Sauron<br />appear on the battlefield,
3320359 3322409 but we ultimately abandoned that idea.
3322569 3326369 And we really felt that the Witch-king<br />was have… Gonna have to substitute
3326532 3329117 as the chief villain for<br />quite a lot of the movie
3329201 3331620 until we actually enter Mordor itself.
3331787 3335237 It is a puzzle, it was a puzzle.<br />It's, "Where does the Witch-king go?"
3335457 3337584 We've gotta set him up as a villain.<br />How do you do that?
3337668 3340128 Where is the best place to do that?<br />Oh, my God, of course.
3340212 3342762 We have our main characters<br />moving towards his lair.
3342923 3346551 So somehow we have to work it into<br />this thing that… That Gandalf is saying.
3346635 3349220 So it is about tension,<br />you know, but it's also about
3349304 3352304 getting through exposition in<br />a way that is not deadening.
3352432 3354782 Well, we had so many<br />different versions of this.
3357771 3358565 I mean, it died in the<br />first hour, there was…
3358607 3359355 You just wanted to<br />run out of the theater.
3359439 3360489 -It was…<br />-Screaming.
3360607 3363193 Yeah, there was nothing…<br />There was no engine driving the story.
3363277 3365153 It was without dramatic tension.
3365320 3368907 And so for us it was about<br />retrieving that and finding that,
3369074 3371034 and doing whatever we<br />had to do to, you know
3371118 3373161 bring back some story dynamics.
3379543 3381878 …Tolkien artwork existing before<br />we started making the movie.
3381962 3383964 You know, Minas Tirith and Helm's Deep,
3385048 3388384 and Rivendell and Hobbiton had all<br />been drawn and painted on various books,
3388468 3390678 and calendars over the years.<br />But I don't think anyone
3390762 3392388 had ever illustrated Minas Morgul.
3392472 3395308 It was… It was a blank. It was<br />like something that no one ever did.
3395392 3399313 And I remember saying to them…<br />To Alan Lee and John Howe
3399479 3401397 when they arrived in New Zealand<br />at the very beginning, saying:
3401481 3404025 "You know what? I…<br />I don't know what Minas Morgul looks like.
3404109 3406945 I've never seen a picture of it.<br />I can kind of imagine it from the book,
3407029 3408279 but it's gonna be interesting."
3408363 3411700 And John was the person that<br />drove the design and he sat down,
3411867 3413576 and came up with this sort of fortress.
3413660 3417289 Because Minas Morgul is<br />a sister city to Minas Tirith
3417456 3420000 that they used to both<br />be Númenórean cities.
3420167 3421876 I mean, this used to be a good-guy city,
3421960 3425422 but it was subsequently…<br />In a war of a bygone age
3425589 3428800 it was overrun by Orcs, and the<br />Orcs have basically commandeered it.
3428884 3431470 And so we wanted the<br />city to have an old beauty
3431637 3435641 a place of wisdom and sort of elegance.<br />But it's been bastardized,
3435807 3442147 so that it has this, you know, this<br />commandeered kind of decaying look.
3444274 3447777 A great piece of sound design<br />where the sound sort of sucks to silence
3447861 3451531 just before that lightning bolt goes up.
3451698 3453951 I thought the guys did a great job.
3454117 3457267 And I never thought that that<br />was going to work, that… That…
3459456 3462856 It's just such a connection too.<br />I mean, I love Gandalf and Pippin…
3465170 3467005 And Frodo and Sam<br />are right underneath it.
3467089 3472427 And it's just so valuable. I just…<br />I, you know, it's… Just love the way
3472594 3476494 that we can finally get some connection<br />between these different story lines.
3478892 3482145 The helmet of the Witch-king<br />was redesigned during our pickups.
3482312 3485023 We had an earlier<br />Witch-king helmet design
3485190 3488610 that we thought we were going to<br />use, and we actually shot some footage
3488694 3490653 of that design back in<br />principal photography.
3490737 3492564 But we ultimately felt he looked like…
3492606 3494616 Too much like Sauron, that Sauron's look…
3494700 3497452 His appearance in the prologue<br />of the <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i>
3497536 3500086 was… Quite evoked the<br />feeling of the Witch-king.
3500205 3501873 And we thought that people<br />would get the two mixed up,
3501957 3503833 and they'd think that Sauron<br />was on the back of the Nazgûl,
3503917 3508463 so we had Weta do a radical<br />redesign on the Witch-king's helmet.
3508630 3511174 And I just said, "Listen, whatever<br />you do, make it look completely different
3511258 3513676 to Sauron's helmet.<br />There can be no confusion."
3513760 3516679 And Christian Rivers drove the<br />design, and we ended up coming up
3516763 3519099 with this very iconic Witch-king helmet
3519266 3521935 which does set him apart<br />from any other character.
3522519 3525605 So that was a valuable<br />thing to do at the last minute.
3532279 3535406 I remember the original footage<br />of this scene with them walking out.
3535490 3536683 There's a lot of takes that are just
3536725 3538201 ruined by the way that<br />the Orcs are moving.
3538285 3542456 And we ended up picking the very best<br />bits and pieces that we could for the cut.
3542622 3545291 They end up looking like those<br />creatures out of <i>Wizard of Oz.</i>
3545375 3547825 Yeah.<br />The Orcs should have been relatively easy…
3551590 3553466 And partly it was the performance<br />of the Orcs, that we ended up…
3553550 3556550 And it wasn't anybody's fault,<br />it's just almost by osmosis…
3556636 3562934 We ended up with sort of waddling,<br />bent over, sort of duck-walking Orcs.
3563101 3565520 And everyone who was<br />an Orc felt you had to walk
3565604 3569941 like a monkey with a full…<br />With a nappy, with a diaper that was full.
3570108 3572568 You know, it was interesting,<br />but it too often evoked
3572652 3576114 a sort of Witchiepoo from <i>H.R.<br />Pufnstuf</i> kind of look
3576490 3578282 where we had hook noses and big chins.
3578366 3580827 And the Orcs, whatever<br />way you looked at them
3580994 3582704 they were ultimately just not scary.
3582788 3584455 Not in the way that the Uruk-hai were.
3584539 3586499 The Uruk-hai, we managed to<br />get a lot of menace out of them
3586583 3589002 in the Helm's Deep scenes and stuff, but…
3589169 3591546 We actually set aside<br />some time during pickups,
3591630 3593131 and we had Richard Taylor and his guys
3593215 3596415 redesign the prosthetics of<br />the Orcs, redesign the costumes,
3596510 3599513 and what you see in the<br />finished <i>Return of the King</i> now
3599679 3602057 is a combination of some of our old Orcs,
3602224 3605018 but a lot of the close-ups<br />and featured characters
3605185 3608688 are the new Orcs that we re-shot<br />on pickups, just to make them look
3608772 3610565 a little bit more scary.
3610732 3613232 This was a scene that we<br />did on-set motion capture.
3613360 3615194 All of the motion capture<br />that Andy Serkis was doing
3615278 3619991 was done live as we were filming Elijah<br />and Sean on the set at the same time.
3620158 3623036 Usually it's done later in a<br />studio in post-production.
3627833 3632045 In Minas Tirith, you know, we built a big<br />set in the quarry where Helm's Deep was.
3632212 3635590 And we actually used the Helm's<br />Deep as part of the Minas Tirith set.
3635674 3636925 We just painted it white.
3637092 3640803 And I noticed in the back of the shot<br />just then, there was a big curved wall
3640887 3642847 which was actually the Helm's Deep wall.
3642931 3645600 There's the curved wall<br />on the left-hand side.
3645767 3649771 But Minas Tirith was a lot bigger and<br />it's more expansive than Helm's Deep.
3655902 3659114 Osgiliath was mostly a<br />miniature for the wide shots,
3659281 3662825 and then the close-up stuff was done…<br />The original shooting was done
3662909 3665828 out in a parking lot in the Hutt<br />Valley near a railway station,
3665912 3668664 and then in the pickups, and<br />we're looking at pickup footage here
3668748 3670708 where Faramir is walking through the city
3670792 3672168 they were done in a studio.
3672252 3675088 During our pickups we rebuilt the set.
3677924 3681135 In addition to the Witch-king, we<br />wanted to create another Orc character
3681219 3683519 who was like the<br />general on the battlefield.
3683680 3685890 Because we felt that our<br />Orcs were so anonymous
3685974 3688184 that we wanted to actually<br />personify one or two of them
3688268 3690854 just to give our villainy a focus.
3694858 3699446 The character that we're being<br />introduced to here just very briefly
3699613 3701156 is Gothmog.
3701615 3704326 We have a teasing shot<br />of his deformed hand here.
3704492 3707537 And I had the Weta guys come<br />up with the idea of Gothmog
3707704 3711917 as a sort of Elephant Man-style Orc, some…<br />An Orc who has been stricken
3712083 3716630 by some elephantiasis-type<br />disease and deformity.
3716796 3719882 Just because I wanted to, you know,<br />create a very distinctive character.
3719966 3723678 The name Gothmog is used by<br />Tolkien, but the physical description,
3723845 3727095 and characteristics are sort of<br />something that we came up with.
3727182 3730682 He was the lieutenant, probably<br />one of the Nazgûl, actually, Gothmog…
3732687 3734021 But he was one of the lieutenants<br />who captained the armies Pelennor.
3734105 3736605 The shot that we're looking<br />at now of the guards…
3739486 3740487 -That's…<br />-Kirk.
3740654 3743364 …Kirk, our stunt coordinator,<br />who usually just coordinates.
3743448 3746409 He's not on-screen, and he just<br />usually controls the stunt guys.
3746493 3747952 But I said, "Why don't<br />you just put the suit on,
3748036 3749453 and have the honor<br />of doing the last shot."
3749537 3752415 And so we filmed Kurt rolling<br />down the stairs, he crashed
3752499 3754417 we did it three or four<br />times, and then we wrapped,
3754501 3755901 and we had our big party.
3756002 3759005 And that was the…<br />The end of our <i>Lord of the Rings</i> filming.
3766012 3768556 Here, that chap there<br />who's giving everyone spears
3768640 3772185 is actually Royd Tolkien, J.R.R.<br />Tolkien's great-grandson.
3772352 3775702 The Tolkien family have had a<br />fairly hands-off relationship with us.
3775855 3779859 Royd had seen <i>Fellowship of the<br />Ring,</i> and he'd seen <i>The Two Towers,</i>
3780026 3783446 and he obviously realized that what we<br />were doing was okay, so he wrote to us,
3783530 3785615 and said, "Listen, I'd love to<br />come to New Zealand and visit."
3785699 3788034 And we said, "Do you want to be an extra?<br />Do you want to be a soldier?"
3788118 3790203 And he was… He was very happy to.
3799129 3801422 This sequence is a rather<br />elaborate combination
3801506 3804675 of a sequence we originally shot, which<br />you're looking at now with the water.
3804759 3806636 Which is, again, our<br />wet set, what we called it.
3806720 3809805 It's the same water that the guys<br />went on their horses outside Isengard.
3809889 3812600 It's the Dead Marshes, it's the…<br />Outside Moria.
3812767 3816354 We used a multipurpose little<br />puddle of water that we created.
3817522 3821025 John Mahaffie directed a lot of this<br />scene of the Orcs coming off their boats.
3821109 3824696 And then I directed the stuff<br />with David Wenham here.
3824863 3829326 So this is a really tricky little intercut<br />between new footage and old footage.
3829492 3833455 We had no water when I was shooting.<br />We just had David and the rocks.
3835540 3836958 So that's an old shot.
3837125 3841171 You know, and then this shot here<br />is an old. These splashes are all old.
3841379 3843172 There's stuff that John Mahaffie shot.
3843256 3845341 But whenever you see<br />David fighting with a sword
3845425 3847677 it's the new stuff that<br />we did in the studio.
3847761 3850179 Because we never really had<br />Faramir as part of this battle,
3850263 3853725 and obviously he's there,<br />he's commanding the army.
3853892 3857520 And we wanted to give him<br />some decent fight footage
3857687 3859814 just to help strengthen his character,
3859898 3862248 and his commitment to<br />defending Minas Tirith.
3869282 3871826 The beacon sequence is one<br />of my favorite scenes in the film.
3871910 3873160 -Me too.<br />-And it's one of those scenes
3873244 3876080 that Tolkien wrote about, but he<br />didn't make a sort of big deal of it.
3876164 3879167 I loved getting Alan Lee to<br />come up with some ideas,
3879334 3882378 for what it would look like,<br />and what would it actually be?
3882462 3885048 So Alan designed basically<br />what you're seeing here.
3885215 3889219 And Barrie Osborne did most<br />of the directing of this sequence.
3889386 3891345 It was a day that I was<br />shooting something else,
3891429 3893597 and so he had Billy Boyd<br />and this beacon was built
3893681 3896142 in the same quarry as Minas Tirith.
3896309 3898894 And Barrie pretty much<br />directed all of the sequence
3898978 3900521 where Pippin lights the beacon.
3900605 3902481 What I love about the<br />beacons is the concept
3902565 3905526 of who actually are the guys who<br />have to sit up there all day long
3905610 3909155 with some matches or a flint,<br />waiting to set light to them.
3909322 3911407 And I… I imagine that it's<br />been hundreds of years,
3911491 3912908 and these things have never been lit.
3912992 3915077 It's a job that gets passed<br />down from father to son.
3915161 3918706 And some old man hands his<br />young son the matches and says:
3918873 3922502 "Now it's your turn, my boy,"<br />and, "I never got the order to light,
3922669 3925671 but maybe some point in your<br />lifetime, you'll have to light it.
3925755 3927507 "Make sure these matches stay dry."
3927674 3930259 And they must have a<br />very lonely, solitary lifestyle
3930343 3934096 -living up there by these beacons, and…<br />-This is what you were thinking about?
3934180 3935859 Yeah. This is… This is what was… I was…
3935901 3936724 This was our problem.
3936808 3938517 I was thinking there might be a TV series
3938601 3939769 and…<br /><i>-The Beacon Boy.</i>
3939853 3942503 <i>-The Beacon People.</i><br />-You might get put on beacon duty.
3945358 3949008 You reckon it's like… It's like a<br />sort of national service in the army
3950780 3951906 that it's something that all young people<br />have to do before they get a real career.
3951990 3953199 Yeah.
3954742 3957370 When Pippin and Gandalf are riding to<br />Minas Tirith, the beacons are already lit.
3957454 3961499 So we obviously changed the position<br />in the story for our beacon sequence.
3961666 3964210 A lot of the flames that<br />we see in the distance
3964377 3967755 are little CG flames that<br />we edit in post-production.
3967922 3970841 The beacon that you're looking at<br />here was actually built on the mountains.
3970925 3974303 And we helicoptered the beacon in and<br />the little hut that these guys live in,
3974387 3978725 and we… We flew around in the<br />helicopter and shot it being set on fire.
3978892 3982269 But what you see here is real, there's<br />none of this is a… A special effect
3982353 3985565 apart from the distant beacon<br />that lights at the very end.
3985732 3987218 But the hills are real, those beautiful
3987260 3988984 clouds that are in the<br />valley were all real.
3989068 3992363 It was all just absolutely the way it<br />was on the morning that we shot it.
3992447 3994747 And then we just added<br />in those distant flames.
3994908 3997159 This is a helicopter<br />sequence that David Nowell
3997243 3999243 our wonderful aerial DP, shot for us.
3999329 4001372 Obviously none of these<br />fires are actually there.
4001456 4004125 We added the flames<br />in later on the computer.
4005168 4007503 I just love the majestical<br />size of the sequence,
4007587 4010437 and Howard does a beautiful<br />musical track through here.
4011257 4012207 Ah, stunning score.
4012800 4013750 Ah, stunning score.
4024938 4026988 And finally Aragorn is back in the story.
4030109 4030985 That was one of our concerns, wasn't it.<br />About this film
4031069 4033321 is that for a while<br />Aragorn sort of actually
4033363 4035657 just sits and waits for<br />something to happen.
4036157 4039577 And I think we got away with it, but it's<br />not… You know, it was always our worry
4039661 4042163 because we wanted,<br />obviously, his character to…
4042372 4044707 No, if you had a choice you<br />would never do it that way.
4044791 4045875 No, but it's the way
4045959 4047585 -that Tolkien devised it in the book.<br />-Tolkien wrote it.
4047669 4051269 And… And it was important to get to<br />this moment as quickly as possible.
4053091 4054216 Because it basically energizes and…<br />And, you know, brings Aragorn
4054300 4055850 back into our narrative now.
4055969 4058419 It was about sort of<br />trying to create a mystery…
4061307 4062349 As to what…<br />What he actually was meant to do.
4062433 4064206 And that his path lay<br />in another direction.
4064248 4065936 And that eventually he would have to go,
4066020 4069315 and become who he was born to be.<br />As Elrond says…
4069482 4071317 -Yeah.<br />-…and raise the Army of the Dead.
4071401 4073611 We tried to foreshadow that<br />without giving it away too much.
4073695 4074988 Yeah.
4084247 4087497 This was difficult, again, because<br />you have… You have Théoden…
4089502 4090794 We're having to go<br />somewhere else, not to Gondor
4090878 4095508 which you would normally do in a film, you<br />would have them all set off for Gondor.
4095675 4098219 But in actual fact, we needed<br />them to go to Dunharrow
4098303 4101096 which again is… Took a…<br />Took quite a bit of sleight of hand.
4101180 4103930 And just how do you explain<br />that to an audience, to say:
4106519 4108604 …have been lit now, and they've<br />gotta rush off to help the Gondor,
4108688 4111440 but no, they're actually just gonna<br />pop off to a place called Dunharrow
4111524 4115474 "that we don't… Know nothing about,<br />and wait for a while instead of rushing."
4115862 4119281 So it was these little obstacles<br />that Tolkien's book kind of presented
4119365 4121450 in terms of…<br />As you say, if you were doing this
4121534 4125412 as an original screenplay, some of these<br />things you would actually not do, you'd…
4125496 4128207 You'd change the story line, but…
4128374 4130876 Dunharrow was something that<br />we needed, because it's the entrance
4130960 4134610 to the Paths of the Dead, and that's<br />ultimately why we had to go there.
4143139 4146851 A nice little sequence with Merry, who's…<br />Dom's on his knees,
4147018 4149645 and that's Kiran, our scale<br />double, kneeling down there.
4149729 4153065 This was filmed, obviously, on our<br />Edoras location down in the South Island
4153149 4156069 that we built, and part of<br />the original photography.
4161282 4164077 …that we could never<br />really develop properly…
4164243 4166037 …because we didn't have time.
4166871 4168771 This was another little pickup we did.
4173211 4174962 …and so we shot the<br />Orlando piece with Brett…
4175046 4177756 …John's double, on the back of the horse<br />and then we shot the close-ups of John.
4177840 4180926 And we just shot them in front of<br />the blue screen and we… We found
4181010 4184138 an old shot from the<br />South Island location
4184305 4186015 that we had done<br />about three years earlier
4186099 4188892 that served as a background<br />plate for the shot with Orlando.
4188976 4191576 It was actually filmed in<br />the Wellington parking lot.
4192480 4194732 The thing that's really<br />happening in <i>Return of the King</i>
4194816 4198277 which we did flirt with the idea<br />of originally in our scriptwriting
4198361 4201511 is that there is a broad assault<br />happening on Middle-earth
4201656 4203866 at this point in time. That…<br />That there's actually…
4203950 4206800 Lothlórien, where Galadriel<br />comes from, is being attacked.
4206953 4210247 And Lothlórien is on fire and there's<br />fighting between Elves and Orcs.
4210331 4214252 And Lothlórien, the northern<br />mountains where the Dwarves are based
4214419 4217254 is being attacked.<br />And so there's a war that's broken out
4217338 4219966 that Sauron has<br />attacked on multiple fronts.
4220133 4223177 And whilst that's spectacular and<br />it would have been kind of exciting…
4223261 4225804 And believe me, I would<br />have loved to have shown that…
4225888 4229142 It's difficult, because the<br />film is much better served
4229308 4232812 by focusing it on one central<br />battlefront, which is Minas Tirith.
4232979 4235356 And, you know, you have a problem<br />with Minas Tirith being attacked,
4235440 4237691 and you have to solve the<br />problem of how they defend it,
4237775 4239109 and ultimately what that leads to.
4239193 4241612 And once you have these<br />battles breaking out in other places
4241696 4243155 you've got to follow up on those.
4243239 4245407 And, you know, who<br />wins the Lothlórien battle?
4245491 4247242 I mean, how does that<br />suddenly resolve itself?
4247326 4249426 Shoot it as a pickup<br />for the 25th edition.
4250288 4251955 -Twenty-fifth anniversary? You mean…<br />-Yeah.
4252039 4253374 …we should shoot all<br />that and put it in the…
4253458 4255125 Get Haldir out of retirement and…
4255209 4257809 Well, the Elves are immortal.<br />They… They won't age.
4259338 4261507 At least the Elvish actors will<br />stay as young as they are today.
4261591 4264510 Faramir's duty, obviously,<br />is to hold Osgiliath
4264677 4268138 which is really on the outskirts of<br />Minas Tirith, the real target of the Orcs.
4268222 4271225 But to get there they have to<br />take over this ruined city. And…
4271309 4274353 And Faramir is fighting as<br />desperately as he possibly can.
4274520 4277231 And it was important that there<br />was nothing about what Faramir did
4277315 4280776 that was a failure. That he was ultimately<br />overwhelmed by the numbers of Orcs.
4280860 4284154 He just could do nothing about it.<br />The size of his force was dwarfed
4284238 4285823 by the enemy that they were against.
4285907 4289368 But we wanted to show Faramir's<br />determination and his heroism
4289535 4291954 at trying to do his<br />duty as best he could.
4292121 4295374 But ultimately, you know, once you're<br />being overrun and the battle is lost
4295458 4298168 your then responsibility is<br />to save the lives of your men
4298252 4300045 which is why he orders the retreat.
4300129 4303298 That it's just hopeless and he<br />has to try to get back to Minas Tirith
4303382 4306594 because that's when…<br />Where his men can be best used.
4306969 4310319 That was a funny shot, because<br />we had Faramir in one of the takes…
4312058 4314852 And the camera then sort of pans<br />off to the sky so that you can see it.
4314936 4317355 And there was a big Air New Zealand jet.
4317522 4319072 -Was there?<br />-That's right. Yeah.
4319232 4321400 -I don't remember that.<br />-It was very funny.
4322109 4324859 I remember this day because<br />we did a press conference…
4327240 4328115 After we shot this actual footage of<br />these guys under the Nazgûl attack.
4328199 4330535 We then wrapped early<br />that day and we went,
4330701 4333579 and we did our very first press<br />conference in front of the media.
4333663 4337124 It was in…<br />Towards the end of the year 2000.
4339669 4344131 Gothmog is played by Lawrence<br />Makoare, who played Lurtz.
4344298 4348344 When we decided to add an Orc character<br />to <i>Return of the King,</i> we just thought:
4348511 4351555 "Let's give it to Lawrence. Let's…<br />Let's get Lawrence to do it again."
4351639 4354683 And the wonderful thing with prosthetics,<br />that if you have a… A great actor
4354767 4359438 like Lawrence who is just so brilliant at<br />pushing energy through that rubber mask
4359605 4363705 you can then create a completely different<br />character for the same actor to play.
4369198 4372785 See, this was a sequence<br />that we had a little bit of trouble
4372952 4374328 because we… We've put it
4374412 4376580 in a completely different place to how…<br />Where it was shot.
4376664 4379666 If you remember when Gandalf<br />and Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith,
4379750 4382461 for the very first time and<br />they get to the brow of the hill,
4382545 4384046 and stop and they look at the city
4384130 4387090 what was gonna happen was that<br />they were gonna see this retreat.
4387174 4389324 And then they were gonna go and intervene
4389468 4391568 before they even had gone into the city.
4391721 4393764 But we…<br />We've now put the sequence much later,
4393848 4398060 and we had Gandalf actually<br />leaving from the gates of the city itself.
4405651 4408153 I love this shot. I love the<br />way we're on a tracking vehicle,
4408237 4411240 and suddenly the camera whips<br />around, and there's Minas Tirith.
4411324 4415119 Which is… Gives it such a reality,<br />because you're on this bumpy vehicle,
4415286 4417579 and it's a shot that you don't<br />expect is suddenly gonna become
4417663 4419498 a special-effects shot.<br />But boom, there it is.
4419582 4422167 But that just shows you what you<br />can do these days with the tracking,
4422251 4425420 and putting miniatures into shots that<br />are rough and bumpy. In the old days
4425504 4428757 everything had to be so smooth,<br />and, like, motion-control cameras
4428841 4431426 had to be used if you were<br />gonna put miniatures into things.
4431510 4434310 But now there's such a<br />degree of freedom and flexibility.
4440186 4443481 This was a wonderful set that Grant Major
4443648 4446150 designed for us in the quarry.
4446317 4449028 And Minas Tirith was<br />really just one huge set.
4449195 4453866 And the big gateway into this<br />courtyard was the… The central focus.
4454033 4455993 And then up the hill
4456160 4458787 was all the little streets and<br />the alleyways, which you see
4458871 4461164 in all the other sequences<br />that we used for Minas Tirith.
4461248 4464961 It was actually quite extensive, and<br />it was a complex network of streets
4465127 4468130 that enabled us to shoot different<br />scenes and different places.
4468214 4471049 And looking up the street one<br />scene, down the street the next,
4471133 4475388 and this alleyway, that alleyway.<br />And we kept making the city look different
4475554 4479392 which was the beauty of the set<br />that got built. We were able to do that.
4479558 4482227 And occasionally we would<br />make the set look a lot taller
4482311 4484062 by adding miniature<br />buildings to the top of it.
4484146 4487525 But a lot of what you see in<br />these scenes is the actual…
4487692 4490392 The set that was built,<br />because it was pretty enormous.
4498244 4500746 This… Now, this is a scene<br />that I'm glad is back in.
4500830 4504130 Ah, yeah. It's one of my favorite<br />scenes between the two of them
4505918 4507461 picking up on the tension between the…<br />The father and the son.
4507545 4509945 I mean, it's one of the<br />problems with the film…
4512758 4515803 Rude to either David Wenham or John Noble
4515970 4518555 because, you know, they both<br />do superb work in this scene,
4518639 4520739 but they're secondary characters. And…
4520850 4523936 It's just one of those real difficulties<br />that you have so much in the film.
4524020 4527398 It's too long, it's too much going on,
4527565 4529692 and it's the secondary characters
4529859 4531944 that are the ones that,<br />ultimately, are expendable.
4532028 4535280 And it's a horrible term to use, but<br />there's nothing wrong with this scene.
4535364 4538534 And thank God it can actually be.<br />You know, put onto a DVD.
4538701 4541620 Because it's… It's…<br />It's important for these two characters.
4541704 4542997 But then…
4543456 4544956 -You know…<br />-You can feel it…
4549545 4550129 -Which is actually the better cut.<br />-It's where it needed to go.
4550296 4551380 -It needed to go.<br />-Yeah.
4551464 4554007 And, you know, you've just<br />heard this horr… You know
4554091 4557303 Gandalf has got a real bad<br />feeling about Cirith Ungol,
4557470 4559054 and that's where you need to go.
4559138 4561056 And…<br />And yet this was the only place for it
4561140 4564740 because you can't come back to<br />this moment, you needed to play it now.
4564894 4567396 And so that's why I understand<br />that it can't be in there.
4567480 4569580 But it's great that<br />it is in this version.
4582828 4586040 It's interesting, I remember the<br />Sean Bean moment. We were in…
4586207 4588257 -Yeah, we were in that Manapouri…<br />-Yeah.
4591420 4591504 The Manapouri community hall.<br />And we were shooting the Black Gates
4591670 4593171 -in <i>The Two Towers.<br />-Two Towers,</i> yeah.
4593255 4594756 When Frodo and Sam<br />were crawling on the rocks.
4594840 4596550 -And Sean was going home.<br />-Yeah.
4596717 4598969 That's right. Sean was out there,<br />he was filming some other stuff,
4599053 4600679 and he was heading home to England.
4600763 4603890 And we were thinking, "Do we need<br />any more… Any more shots of Boromir?"
4603974 4605684 -Yeah.<br />-And we came up with the idea
4605768 4607102 of putting him in… In this scene.
4607186 4610086 But it was this image that he<br />sees Boromir and not Faramir.
4610773 4610898 But it was this image that he<br />sees Boromir and not Faramir.
4611065 4612815 Just… Just to explain to people…
4615903 4615945 The scene between Denethor<br />and Faramir in the hall
4616112 4618280 was a scene that we were gonna<br />be shooting about a year later.
4618364 4620214 -Yeah.<br />-Like it was on our schedule,
4620366 4622784 and it was actually…<br />All of the Faramir-Denethor scenes
4622868 4625662 were all the last thing that we<br />were shooting in December 2000.
4625746 4629041 And we were, like, with Sean<br />Bean in 1999 in the South Island
4629208 4633129 looking ahead, a year ahead,<br />and thinking, "Well, if we wanted
4633295 4634629 we could put him in<br />the scene with Denethor,
4634713 4636298 but we better…<br />We're going to have to shoot it now."
4636382 4639217 We got no idea what… Really what<br />that scene was gonna end up like.
4639301 4641970 But we just shot Sean against<br />some blacks that we hung
4642054 4644974 on the stage of this little<br />hall, right on the corner,
4645141 4647434 and just getting him<br />to walk forward, smiling,
4647518 4649895 and getting some alternative performance.
4652898 4655609 These scenes that we're<br />looking at now, if you can imagine
4655693 4657194 that at the beginning of the shoot we
4657236 4659029 started to film <i>The<br />Fellowship of the Ring,</i>
4659113 4660822 and we filmed the<br />Hobbits arriving at Bree
4660906 4663117 we filmed the Hobbits leaving Hobbiton
4663284 4665911 the Black Rider scene on the road…<br />All of the scenes from <i>Fellowship.</i>
4665995 4669498 We went down to Queenstown having<br />only filmed <i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
4669582 4672626 And we were gonna continue on<br />filming <i>Fellowship</i> in Queenstown
4672710 4675212 except it was raining<br />and we couldn't go outside
4675296 4676588 which is where we were supposed to shoot.
4676672 4679549 And so we found the only studio<br />space we could in Queenstown
4679633 4682511 which was a very small squash<br />court in the back of a hotel.
4682595 4686098 We could only think of one set<br />that we could build in this tiny room
4686265 4689726 which was the ledge of Cirith<br />Ungol, because it was a very small set.
4689810 4691353 It was just this little piece of rock.
4691437 4694982 So we built it and we had to go<br />in as soon as it started raining.
4695149 4697776 I said to Sean and Elijah.<br />"Guys, I'm sorry to do this to you,
4697860 4700987 and I hate doing it, but we gotta<br />go and we gotta shoot the scenes
4701071 4702697 on the ledge from <i>Return of the King.</i>"
4702781 4705033 And I remember the<br />utter horror on their faces
4705117 4707994 of, like… Because they had only just<br />been doing that early stuff on <i>Fellowship.</i>
4708078 4710580 There was about six weeks<br />into the beginning of filming
4710664 4713083 of a… Of a year and a half.<br />And they had to start doing
4713167 4716503 these incredibly key, important<br />sequences from <i>Return of the King.</i>
4716587 4721383 So suddenly we had to take our<br />mind from leaving Hobbiton to the ledge,
4721550 4724386 and what would they be like?<br />How dirty would their clothing look like?
4724470 4727431 How… How much dirt and<br />grime would be on their faces?
4727598 4729891 What would their hair<br />be like after this journey?
4729975 4732686 And we hadn't filmed anything<br />else of them on the journey.
4732770 4735564 And we had to try to…<br />To imagine what they would look like.
4735648 4738066 And so what you're looking at<br />here with these scenes is, like…
4738150 4742947 Is us in this panicky kind of<br />mode, trying to put ourselves
4743113 4747113 into a completely different movie, and<br />a very key moment of a different movie.
4747201 4748751 And we didn't have Andy either.
4749370 4752170 No, Andy Serkis hadn't<br />joined us at that point in time…
4754625 4755376 So we had other people<br />playing Gollum instead of Andy.
4755542 4759492 And Andy eventually got to do the mo-cap<br />for it and… And the voice, obviously.
4759630 4761630 But he… He did that about three years
4762508 4765094 after the scenes themselves were shot.
4767012 4768597 And that's Lawrence Makoare, isn't it?
4768681 4771267 He also plays Gothmog,<br />who also plays Lurtz.
4771433 4773978 -Yeah.<br />-This was actually a key scene,
4774144 4777272 for us, because it… It was two of<br />our new characters that we created,
4777356 4779774 for the villainy, the<br />Witch-king, who did exist earlier,
4779858 4783111 but this is a new scene of him,<br />and Gothmog, our new character
4783195 4785113 interacting and talking about the attack.
4785197 4788491 And this… This was really the reason<br />that we created these characters
4788575 4791953 because we wanted the villains<br />to have a voice on the battlefield.
4792037 4794287 It couldn't just be<br />Sauron stuck in his tower.
4794415 4796374 And we wanted them to have their general
4796458 4800879 just as Gandalf is the<br />general of the good army.
4801171 4804071 This was the last scene we<br />wrote during the original shoot.
4806343 4809305 It was just before we<br />were about to wrap, finally.
4809471 4811471 It was literally the last scene written.
4811557 4814142 It was written because we<br />had an instinct that at that time
4814226 4817229 we felt that if Pippin was going<br />to be invested in saving Faramir,
4817313 4820065 and that he had this connection,<br />that it might be a good idea
4820149 4822249 to have a scene between the two of them.
4827156 4827239 Because when Faramir rides<br />out and Pippin is singing the song
4827406 4829407 -he's obviously touched with the grief.<br />-Yeah.
4829491 4832702 And then later on he's motivated<br />to try to save Faramir off the pyre.
4832786 4834246 -Exactly.<br />-And we realized
4834413 4837999 that we just don't… Didn't have any<br />connection between Faramir and Pippin.
4838083 4840933 That why would Pippin be<br />caring if he didn't know the guy?
4845758 4849058 You were both on sets filming<br />madly, trying to get things finished.
4851138 4853306 And I remember… We'd had this<br />discussion, and I had to write something.
4853390 4857603 And I remember at 11:00 at<br />night, trying to wake you both up.
4857770 4861565 You were both curled up on sofas,<br />and I was trying to read you stuff.
4861732 4863108 And you were both asleep.
4863275 4865026 -And Jan and I actually…<br />-I was so tired.
4865110 4868610 -…sent it out, regardless, the next…<br />-I was so tired in those days.
4868947 4870697 -Those last days of shooting.<br />-Yeah.
4873786 4877286 And I was… I was… I literally…<br />I think I managed to wake up Fran.
4878916 4880917 We have to wrap, and suddenly<br />there's a new scene to shoot.
4881001 4883587 And I remember it caused<br />everybody a lot of anxiety.
4883837 4886715 But, you know, we managed to<br />squeeze it in. I shot it very simply.
4886799 4888550 I shot it basically in,<br />like, two shots, really.
4888634 4892805 And the guys just did a few takes for<br />us, and we did it in a couple of hours
4892971 4894681 you know, we shot it and squeezed it in.
4894765 4897517 But it evokes to some degree<br />the Beregond relationship
4897601 4898701 -in the books.<br />-Yes.
4898811 4901730 Which is what I actually…<br />It's a part of the book I… I really like.
4901814 4904816 And I do regret that we never were able<br />to put that in the movie, where Pippin…
4904900 4906901 -It was just one more character.<br />-For people that haven't read the book
4906985 4910697 it's when Pippin befriends a<br />Gondorian soldier called Beregond.
4910864 4913825 And Beregond actually takes Pippin<br />under his wing, more so than Gandalf.
4913909 4916786 And he takes Pippin around the<br />city and talks about the city, and…
4916870 4920916 And it's a relationship, which, it doesn't<br />ultimately particularly go anywhere,
4921083 4923877 but it's quite sweet. And…<br />And this always reminds me
4923961 4926061 of the Beregond stuff, although we use…
4930676 4932719 But we also wanted to show<br />here why Faramir was about to do
4932803 4937015 what he was about to do, which is<br />his own personal sense of failure.
4937182 4939268 We found out that Pippin is the only son.
4939435 4942395 We imagine that he probably had a<br />lot of pressure on him from his father,
4942479 4945941 and had been maybe a<br />disappointment to his dad in some ways.
4946108 4949527 I remember Billy thinking about<br />that, that instead of settling down,
4949611 4951780 and thinking about becoming<br />the Thain of the Shire
4951864 4954574 Peregrin was running around<br />the woods with his mate, Merry
4954658 4956117 all of the time and getting into trouble.
4956201 4958411 And so there was this connection<br />between the two of them,
4958495 4960455 and that's why we<br />wanted him to be wearing
4960539 4963041 which is not from the<br />book, Faramir's armor.
4963208 4965858 Because Pippin is wearing<br />Faramir's childhood armor…
4968547 4971925 Because in the book Merry gets given<br />Théoden's childhood armor, doesn't he?
4972009 4973343 Yeah.
4973510 4976429 I love the way that John's<br />playing this scene with his sort of…
4976513 4978609 His disinterest or his… He seemingly is
4978651 4980893 disinterested in… In the fate of Faramir.
4981059 4982909 And it's… And he's doing it beautifully,
4982951 4984979 the way that he's<br />manipulating the situation.
4985063 4987649 And Pippin is almost realizing<br />the manipulation that's occurring
4987733 4989964 isn't he, that Faramir, who's had it, you
4990006 4992446 feel, all his life, is<br />just giving in to it.
4992613 4995713 It was also the reason to<br />understand why Faramir would do this.
4997743 5000870 He understands in this moment, when<br />his father says, "Yes, I… I wish that"
5000954 5003039 that it doesn't really<br />matter what he does now.
5003123 5006251 He cannot ever and will not<br />ever earn his father's love.
5006418 5008295 So it kind of doesn't matter.
5008462 5010464 It puts him in that very dark place.
5010631 5014731 Well, I've always felt that there was<br />an inherent threat to Pippin in this scene
5015969 5018680 because he says, "is there a<br />captain here who will do his lord's will?"
5018764 5022601 And if Faramir doesn't, at that<br />point, step in and say, "I will do it"
5022768 5024644 then there was a sense that<br />maybe Pippin would be ordered out.
5024728 5026078 But that's what Denethor
5027981 5028857 wants to achieve, is he<br />wants Faramir to step in.
5028941 5031291 -So if it's not one, it's the other?<br />-Yes. Yeah.
5039117 5040967 This is Sean's last shot in the film.
5045791 5047091 And it's Andy's last shot.
5047251 5050295 Well, it's actually not, because<br />we shot one of him in… At Forma…
5050379 5051963 -In England, yeah.<br />-…when we were in post,
5052047 5055467 but Andy's second-to-last shot, we…
5055634 5059134 It was just a little coda we put on<br />the front of this scene, wasn't it?
5060931 5065269 We felt that you needed to<br />see Sam trying not to fall asleep.
5065978 5068814 So this is obviously a big<br />departure from the book.
5068981 5072881 Yes, it is. And one of… One of the<br />things that happened very, very early on,
5074236 5078740 and this is going back to '97-'98,<br />we were writing <i>Return of the King,</i>
5078907 5082307 and this actually didn't change…<br />These are probably gray pages
5082452 5084871 that were shot as… As they were.
5085038 5087248 -And…<br />-Original pages that were never revised.
5087332 5090232 Not really revised.<br />I think, Fran, you did some revision…
5092546 5093546 During ADR and stuff,<br />on some of the lines.
5093630 5097509 But the actual concept of<br />Frodo sending Sam away
5097676 5101426 came because we felt… We really<br />felt the lack of dramatic development
5101513 5103223 in this situation.
5103390 5106768 There was a… A number of reasons.<br />One was to provide conflict,
5106935 5110564 and to continue the conflict.<br />And to have this sort of journey
5110731 5113816 up the stairs, where all it's<br />about really is how tired they are,
5113900 5116319 and how cold they are<br />and how hungry they are
5116403 5119865 is actually not that interesting on a…<br />In terms of film.
5120032 5124369 We also felt that the scheming<br />of Gollum needed to have a payoff
5124536 5126538 that he's been scheming against Sam.
5126705 5129541 We needed to pay it<br />off, he needed to win.
5129708 5131834 And we also felt very<br />strongly that we wanted…
5131918 5134963 I remember Fran sort of<br />instinctively knowing this
5135130 5139885 that Frodo had to enter that cave alone,<br />that he had to go in there alone, and…
5140052 5144056 Because as it plays in…<br />In the book, they go in together
5144222 5147851 there's a kind of a…<br />Them getting separated that is, again
5148018 5151188 inherently not that<br />dramatic as it plays out.
5151355 5154650 And we wanted that…<br />For Sam, just, again, to prove
5154816 5157819 that he's never going to<br />leave Frodo, and to turn up.
5157986 5163075 Which gives you that great gunslinger shot<br />that Pete put in when Sam does turn up,
5163241 5167746 and Frodo's about to be<br />put away for food by Shelob.
5167913 5170763 But yeah, that…<br />That's the rationale about why we made
5170916 5174795 this quite significant<br />diversion from the actual book.
5174961 5177211 -It's building up tension. It's just…<br />-Yeah.
5180425 5182002 It…<br />It's doing what was sort of threatened,
5182044 5183303 which is that Gollum could break up
5183387 5185013 -Frodo and Sam's friendship.<br />-Yeah.
5185097 5187056 It's threatened in the book,<br />and we actually wanted
5187140 5188308 -to go beyond the threat…<br />-Yeah.
5188392 5191102 …and make it a reality,<br />because that's just, you know…
5191186 5193636 …making it ultimately<br />more dramatic for a movie.
5193772 5195273 Yeah.
5196858 5200403 And also, I can't remember what happens<br />in the book. It's terrible, isn't it?
5200487 5201488 -You…<br />-Yeah.
5201655 5203948 -I just forget the book.<br />-Yeah. What's us and what's that.
5204032 5205658 The movie, the book, everything<br />gets kind of muddled up.
5205742 5206952 -Yeah.<br />-So in the book
5207119 5209537 Frodo and Sam both go into<br />Shelob's tunnel, don't they?
5209621 5211789 -Yes, they do.<br />-And we wanted in the movie…
5211873 5214542 We thought it would be so much<br />more scary for Frodo to be in there alone.
5214626 5216044 -Yeah.<br />-And the only way we could do that
5216128 5218839 was to get Sam…<br />So it fulfilled several purposes…
5219005 5220205 -Yeah.<br />-…really, to us.
5220298 5223385 It gave us this great ability<br />to then have a period of time
5223552 5225303 where Frodo was all by himself.
5227139 5228806 I remember looking at an early cut, and…
5228890 5231476 And the way that I had<br />shot this scene originally
5231643 5235271 is that… is that Elijah was playing<br />very fierce and very… A lot of hate…
5235355 5239317 Hatred, wasn't he? A lot of anger,<br />and we just thought that wasn't working
5239484 5241284 -eh, Fran?<br />-It didn't feel true…
5245490 5245699 Through the writing of the<br />scripts and shooting the film,
5245866 5248076 so it was…<br />It felt like we needed to pull it back
5248160 5254791 from being a kind of quivering rage,<br />to a more conflicted moment for him.
5254958 5257758 -He's being…<br />-So was it… It was one of those things…
5260338 5262090 And there was a moment<br />where we had Elijah free,
5262174 5264175 and we had a camera<br />free, and you grabbed him,
5264259 5267428 and just popped him sort of against<br />a green screen, didn't you, actually?
5267512 5268930 -Yeah.<br />-I remember, it was against green…
5269014 5270098 -Because…<br />-…it wasn't on the set at all.
5270182 5274182 Well, there are things that are preying<br />on him here, and one thing is paranoia
5275437 5279148 which is… It's the fulfillment of…<br />Of Gollum's promise, which is, you know:
5279232 5281032 "He will try to take it." So it's…
5281151 5285822 It's the Ring having a powerful<br />effect on how Frodo is perceiving Sam.
5286031 5293031 But it's also a sense of Sam's actively<br />jeopardizing the mission now too.
5293205 5295873 The infighting with him and<br />Gollum has got to the point where…
5295957 5297626 -Yeah.<br />-…Sam is threatening
5297793 5299795 their ability to move forward.
5299961 5302964 And he sees that as something<br />that has to be protected at all costs.
5303048 5307886 So he doesn't see many options<br />for himself but to send Sam away.
5308053 5311890 Ultimately, he pays the price<br />for that by having to face Shelob.
5312057 5315107 So that is the price for…<br />For not believing in your friends.
5315227 5317186 -Unless it's…<br />-It seems… It seemed to have a degree
5317270 5320620 -of, you know, logic to it.<br />-It feels more truthful that way too.
5323819 5328406 When he says it: "No. Sam, it's<br />you," that Sam is holding him back,
5328573 5332494 and so all of these things Gollum<br />has succeeded in planting, and…
5332661 5335372 And the Ring has succeeded in planting.
5336915 5339959 And, actually, the other thing<br />that this scene does, ironically
5340043 5341961 is it shocks all the fans of the book.
5342045 5343921 All the people who<br />know the end of the story
5344005 5346174 are now on the edge of their<br />seat, because if we can do that
5346258 5348308 what the hell else are we about to do?
5350512 5352620 This was originally<br />edited to be continuous
5352662 5354912 after Faramir leaves the hallway…<br />The hall.
5355767 5358186 So he talks to Denethor.<br />And then we go straight into this.
5358270 5362107 But in rearranging the structure,<br />we put a little bit of a time gap,
5362274 5365485 and went to the Frodo<br />and Sam on the ledge.
5366695 5371616 We were very careful to pick extras<br />that we felt had the right sort of face
5371783 5375120 because we tried to handpick<br />our extras as much as possible
5375287 5379332 to give the best character<br />faces, and obviously find people
5379499 5384963 that could actually show a<br />degree of sadness and despair.
5385130 5388925 Because it's not that easy to do.<br />It's something quite difficult.
5393221 5400103 Everything was shot at 48 frames a<br />second, apart from this dialogue scene.
5409529 5412156 It was quite difficult to actually<br />get the horses to walk down the hill
5412240 5414158 because I remember<br />that being very slippery
5414242 5417328 that there were cobblestones on this<br />Minas Tirith set, which was a quarry,
5417412 5419580 and we had to put new<br />horseshoes on the horses
5419664 5422167 because normally they<br />have steel horseshoes.
5422334 5424669 But we had to put<br />rubber shoes on their feet
5424836 5427421 which means that they…<br />All the horses had to be re…
5427505 5429705 -Whatever you call it, re-shoed or…<br />-Shod.
5429841 5433291 Shod. Otherwise they were slipping<br />on the cobblestones, and so they…
5433553 5435680 It was quite a big deal at the time.
5441394 5445523 And at the quarry here, the doors<br />open and you just saw the back stone cliff
5445690 5448317 of the quarry, but I think we<br />had a big blue screen out there,
5448401 5452071 and we managed to actually make it<br />look like it's Osgiliath in the distance.
5452155 5457577 Geoff Murphy shot some of the<br />horse action on Pelennor Fields
5457869 5460288 which I think he did a really good job.
5466127 5468254 I remember we had to reshoot some of this
5468338 5470340 because I wanted the horse charge
5470507 5473551 to be just with the<br />armor-plated Gondorians.
5473718 5476888 And that word hadn't got through<br />to second unit, so they shot…
5477055 5479557 They mixed it up with some<br />Rangers, like Faramir's Rangers
5479641 5482894 in the green and brown<br />costumes, and it just didn't look…
5483061 5485229 So I actually had them<br />shoot it all over again,
5485313 5487148 and just put the<br />silver-suited guys there.
5487232 5489567 You occasionally see some<br />of the others in the background
5489651 5492862 just to make up the numbers, but I<br />just wanted the… Sort of the knights
5492946 5494948 the shining suits of the knights.
5498201 5501051 I always loved that line, "Sing me a song.<br />Master Hobbit."
5503456 5504999 -Oh, so the line's in the book…<br />-Over the charge up."
5505083 5506792 -But this actually came off that…<br />-…but does he sing in the book?
5506876 5509754 It came off that line, but I'd also<br />gone out to a karaoke evening
5509838 5513338 with… With Billy and Dom and Orlando and
5513380 5516838 Elijah and Liv, and I'd heard Billy sing.
5517012 5519096 I remember coming back<br />to you, Franny, and saying:
5519180 5522391 "God, Billy Boyd has got the most<br />amazing voice, we've gotta use it."
5522475 5526604 And then we remembered this<br />line, "Give us a song, Master Hobbit."
5526771 5529271 So if you hadn't gone to<br />that karaoke night, you…
5530608 5531192 -This scene may never have existed.<br />-I don't know.
5531359 5532860 -Well, no, I mean that's interesting.<br />-Well, that's true.
5532944 5534116 It's how those little connections happen…
5534158 5534820 Maybe he couldn't sing.
5534904 5537032 …and how you get the ideas for things.
5537198 5540618 I gave Billy some lyrics and just<br />found something from the book.
5540785 5544914 And he had, like, a day or two to<br />come up with some music, and he did.
5545081 5546791 So Billy actually<br />composed the tune itself?
5546875 5549675 -He did, actually. Yeah, he did.<br />-Yeah, that's beautiful.
5552672 5555716 I remember we came up with<br />the idea of the eating during this too
5555800 5557302 because there's something…
5557469 5561139 There's something very nasty<br />about eating and violence.
5561306 5563975 You know, the sort of, the…<br />The… And a sense of violence,
5564059 5566519 and a sense of killing his own son
5566686 5569814 while shoving strawberries<br />and tomatoes into his mouth.
5569981 5572981 And it's… It's just, I don't<br />know, it's something that's…
5573109 5575059 Well, it's cracking and spurting and…
5576362 5579407 -Yeah, the tomato is…<br />-It's… It's that…
5580075 5582410 -It's so… It's very venal.<br />-Juices.
5582577 5584621 -Yeah.<br />-It is.
5584996 5587196 But it's a bit…<br />It's sort of uncomfortable.
5590335 5590835 …the fact that he's stuffing<br />things into his mouth…
5591002 5592630 …than it would be if he was just sitting
5592672 5594422 in a chair, doing exactly<br />the same dialogue.
5594506 5597092 It's sort of the fact that<br />he's sort of enjoying…
5597258 5600469 Because usually in situations like this,<br />when there's life-and-death situations,
5600553 5605016 and it's war and it's, you know, huge<br />threat, you would lose your appetite.
5605183 5607833 And the fact that he's<br />sitting there kind of eating
5607936 5611689 even that helps sort of show his…<br />How deranged he is,
5611856 5614442 and how sort of<br />disconnected from it all he is.
5616027 5620198 This shot here, we did during pickups,<br />and we didn't really have anything
5620365 5623034 from the original shoot that<br />showed Gandalf's reaction
5623118 5625370 to the loss of Faramir and his men,
5625537 5628237 and so we came up with<br />something very simple, and…
5628540 5631042 Just to sort of give us the mood.
5638341 5641386 This was shot in the South<br />Island near Queenstown,
5641553 5643220 and it's one of my<br />favorite locations, actually.
5643304 5646474 I don't know why, but I just love the<br />fields and the trees and the mountains,
5646558 5649060 and the wonderful, huge, big army camp.
5649227 5651395 Lots of extras.<br />One of our biggest extra days.
5651479 5656484 This would have been at least 300 soldiers<br />and about a hundred horses, probably.
5656651 5659320 It was a difficult bit of the story,<br />as we've talked about earlier
5659404 5663491 just having to somehow justify why,<br />in this urgent rush to get to Minas Tirith
5663575 5667119 they have the luxury of sort of stopping<br />and waiting and camping for a while.
5667203 5668996 But the scene between<br />Aragorn and Théoden here
5669080 5671332 is designed to somehow account for that.
5671499 5674199 We finally figured out that<br />they have an expectation…
5676671 5679771 -That there is not that many.<br />-Yeah, that Théoden is wanting…
5682886 5683761 They're all gathering at<br />this meeting place, but it's…
5683845 5685506 It's all driving,<br />hopefully, the narrative.
5685548 5686555 It takes away the urgency
5686639 5688057 from the story a little<br />bit, that's the problem.
5688141 5691691 I know, but we were trying to drive<br />narratively towards this decision
5693396 5694522 that Aragorn must make, because he knows
5694606 5697525 they don't have enough men. They…<br />He knows time is against them.
5697609 5701487 So that when he is confronted with<br />Elrond saying. "You need more men"…
5701654 5704654 This was a sort of a dodgy<br />bit of the story too, because it…
5707118 5707744 That the camp that they're all<br />waiting for… For the soldiers to arrive
5707911 5711289 is the pathway to the Paths of the Dead.<br />It's just…
5711456 5713207 It's one of those weird<br />geographical things that…
5713291 5714334 Yeah.
5714500 5718504 I don't know, it… I just found it<br />a little bit icky around here, but…
5718671 5721671 Of course, this doesn't actually<br />happen this way in the book.
5722091 5722467 It is something that we changed.
5722634 5725719 Yeah, but… But the pathways,<br />the Paths of the Dead are still here.
5725803 5726429 -Those are in the book. Dunharrow…<br />-Yes.
5726596 5729396 …was the way that you go<br />towards the Paths of the Dead.
5734229 5736079 -…taken that path. I believe.<br />-Yeah.
5742570 5745239 That shot of the ghost was so<br />subtle in the theatrical version…
5745323 5746740 -Too subtle, isn't it?<br />-…that we have…
5746824 5750161 We… We've done a thing on the<br />DVD to make him a bit more obvious.
5752497 5755797 No, but you won't in this DVD<br />that we're talking about right now…
5757669 5760213 Make the ghost a bit<br />more obvious and clear.
5760922 5763883 There was one point in an<br />earlier draft that we had Aragorn
5763967 5765567 looking at a vision of Arwen.
5765677 5768888 Because we were always thinking of ways<br />in which to connect the two characters.
5768972 5770890 And at one point he looks up at the path,
5770974 5773100 and he doesn't see the King<br />of the Dead as he does now.
5773184 5775561 He sees Arwen, who…<br />Who talks about his fate.
5775728 5778522 But we felt that we had to substitute<br />that for the King of the Dead.
5778606 5780984 And instead we put<br />Arwen into Aragorn's dream.
5781150 5784500 She is the one in the book that<br />remind him of the Paths of the Dead.
5785738 5788338 At this moment, Philippa's<br />thumbing through the book.
5788533 5791369 -Yeah.<br />-Looking for the appropriate moment.
5791536 5794163 "The days are short. If thou have<br />haste, remember the Paths of the Dead."
5794247 5795623 Yeah.
5796624 5798774 This… This was to really earn the moment…
5801921 5803964 That we wanted to be some sense<br />of camaraderie between these two.
5804048 5807218 They were two characters that had really<br />had nothing much to do with each other
5807302 5809803 in the story up until now, and<br />so we wanted a connection
5809887 5811222 to start to form.
5816269 5817394 …find him his helmet and suit him up.
5817478 5820428 It's Théoden's childhood<br />armor in the book, but of course…
5822900 5826050 Because we've already used<br />some of Faramir's childhood armor.
5829449 5832410 This was all shot in the<br />studio, a very, very tiny studio.
5832577 5834588 And we just put a few<br />little dead pine trees
5834630 5836497 around and some wind through their hair.
5836581 5840752 But it was done under fairly minimal<br />circumstances during pickups, where
5840918 5842711 because you're just<br />shooting some extra scenes
5842795 5844838 you can't really afford to<br />build big sets or anything.
5844922 5847842 So we improvised, and<br />just in this little tin shed
5848009 5849718 put a few tents and some trees around,
5849802 5852752 and we sort of get away<br />with it, it doesn't look too bad.
5860104 5862113 And there was a little<br />bit of extension there.
5862155 5863983 Where we just put the end of the scene in
5864067 5867867 that we originally shot, where Éomer<br />is really trying to dissuade Éowyn
5867987 5871532 from the idea of going to battle.<br />He sort of knows what she's thinking.
5871616 5874619 He has his suspicions that<br />she's gonna try to do something,
5874786 5876203 and he's trying to warn her off.
5876287 5878747 It's a bond between a brother and a<br />sister where each of them really knows
5878831 5880040 what the other is thinking.
5880124 5882424 It was also, we wanted<br />to set up her heroism…
5885296 5886714 Because he predicts that he would flee or<br />she would flee, their courage would fail.
5886798 5887799 And what we love
5888132 5891386 about her in that moment<br />all alone is that it doesn't fail.
5891552 5895052 The set at Dunharrow ended up<br />being filmed in four different locations.
5897058 5898434 The horse riding up the<br />zigzag track is at the quarry
5898518 5900227 that we shot Helm's<br />Deep and everything in.
5900311 5902229 Inside the tent is obviously in a studio.
5902313 5905817 We also filmed around near<br />Island Bay, some of the tent scenes
5905983 5908444 where Aragorn goes<br />out into Théoden's tent.
5908611 5910738 We filmed some near Mount Victoria
5910905 5913240 which was the scenes<br />where they're departing.
5913324 5915409 And then we built a piece<br />of Dunharrow Plateau
5915493 5917286 in the backlot at Stone<br />Street for pickups.
5917370 5920915 It's an amalgam of four or five<br />different sets or different locations.
5921082 5923917 Which is kind of weird, because it's<br />such a simple little… Little sequence
5924001 5927296 in a contained area, that you'd think we<br />could have just done it all in one place.
5927380 5929330 But it didn't work out that way at all.
5929465 5933302 It was actually quite a weird,<br />difficult little sequence to film.
5942728 5945078 One of the things that<br />we always wanted to do…
5948109 5948526 Or one of the things that we were<br />working towards with Arwen's story
5948693 5951371 is that she, in giving<br />up her immortality,
5951413 5954198 sort of symbolized,<br />really, by the Evenstar
5954365 5958411 which is a device that we came up…<br />A visual device which we came up with
5958578 5961330 that she would begin to become vulnerable
5961497 5964333 to the evil of the<br />world as it was growing
5964500 5968504 the evil of… Of Sauron as…<br />As he grows stronger.
5968671 5970464 And that was part of her protection.
5970548 5973667 She was one of the<br />last born of her people,
5973709 5976429 and so was more vulnerable, in a way.
5976596 5979724 And so we wanted to<br />sort of have this about her
5979891 5982059 that this is a conscious<br />decision that she makes.
5982143 5986731 And that the longer she stays in<br />this world, the more vulnerable she is.
5986898 5993738 And we push it to a point where<br />she literally is becoming mortal,
5993905 5998284 and that any grace that was conferred<br />on her by being one of the Eldar
5998451 6000411 she has forsaken, she has given away.
6000578 6003414 And so she is dying,<br />literally dying, and it…
6003581 6005781 We wanted to push<br />it to the ultimate point
6005917 6011005 of Aragorn needing to destroy Sauron…<br />The failure of Frodo or Aragorn to…
6011172 6015843 To confront Sauron or to destroy the<br />Ring, would mean the death of Arwen.
6016260 6018804 And this is something that she's facing.
6025144 6028194 The presence of Elrond is the<br />result of us totally changing…
6030566 6031192 The broken-sword story, that
6031359 6034027 you know, as we've talked<br />about in earlier commentaries
6034111 6037490 Aragorn carries the broken sword with him
6037657 6040742 almost from the very beginning of<br /><i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> in the book.
6040826 6043162 And in the film we didn't<br />want that to happen.
6043329 6046373 We wanted the moment of the re-forging<br />of the sword to have a significance,
6046457 6050127 and to mark a particular point in the…<br />In the story
6050294 6052964 where the importance of that can be felt.
6053130 6055758 And so we had the<br />broken sword at Rivendell
6055925 6059475 we had it obviously being re-forged<br />at this particular point in time.
6059595 6062764 And then the question became,<br />"How does Aragorn actually get it?"
6062848 6066519 And it… We really just needed<br />a courier to deliver the sword.
6066686 6070439 And… And I know that we debated whether<br />it should be Arwen a long time ago,
6070523 6073609 and we ended up with Elrond<br />really feeling like the right person to…
6073693 6078739 To deliver the sword, and to basically<br />lay out to Aragorn what he has to do.
6085454 6088904 In the book, really, Elrond sends<br />his sons to Aragorn, so textually…
6090501 6092586 -But not with the re-forged sword, is it?<br />-No, no.
6092670 6094463 -He doesn't, because he already has it.<br />-It already has happened, yeah.
6094547 6096590 But he does, in terms<br />of the Paths of the Dead
6096674 6100761 send his sons with a message to…<br />To remember the Paths of the Dead.
6100928 6103222 So, you know,<br />textually, I think it's okay.
6103389 6106392 It's also…<br />It's just the whole rules of storytelling
6106559 6108977 which says you can't<br />introduce a new character here,
6109061 6112356 or perhaps a character that<br />you really don't care about.
6112523 6115275 Because you're missing this<br />opportunity for the personal investment
6115359 6120197 that Elrond has in Aragorn<br />taking up that sword.
6128539 6129639 The sword was so long.
6133919 6135504 I remember Viggo, when he first,<br />you know, came across the sword, he…
6135588 6138007 He really had worries<br />about fighting with it
6138174 6141260 because he was used to<br />fighting with a shorter sword.
6141427 6143175 And it was also so long that you couldn't
6143217 6145138 actually put the<br />scabbard around your wai…
6145222 6146472 You know, on your belt,
6146557 6148141 and walk around with<br />the sword in the scabbard
6148225 6150143 because it was just dragging behind you.
6150227 6152980 And your arms weren't long<br />enough to actually pull the sword out
6153064 6155065 from a scabbard that<br />was around your waist.
6155149 6156817 So therefore we never had the scabbard.
6156901 6158944 Once Aragorn pulls it<br />out of the scabbard here
6159028 6161196 which he's able to do, because it…<br />He was just holding the scabbard
6161280 6163740 rather than having it strapped<br />on, we'd never bothered
6163824 6166326 with the scabbard anymore,<br />that he only just carries the sword
6166410 6167619 around with him the whole time.
6167703 6169663 Because it was just…<br />The thing was so huge
6169747 6170831 that it was actually
6170915 6174251 physically, it was too long<br />to be able to do anything with.
6174418 6177212 He straps it to his horse, he<br />doesn't put it around his… On his belt.
6177296 6180758 We just carry the sword into the<br />Paths of the Dead as a naked sword.
6187306 6188932 With our tiny set that we have here.
6189016 6190601 And this was particularly<br />memorable this day
6190685 6192436 because it was in the middle of a storm.
6192520 6196106 And I have a lot of admiration for<br />Viggo and Miranda's concentration here
6196190 6200319 because what you're listening to is<br />dialogue that's recorded later in ADR
6200486 6203614 it's edited in, you know,<br />after we finished shooting.
6203781 6207952 But the original dialogue was them<br />talking with the sound of this tin shed
6208119 6211163 crashing and rattling<br />in the wind and the rain.
6211330 6214500 And it was just a…<br />It was a huge storm, and it was so loud
6214667 6216376 that it was actually<br />quite hard to concentrate.
6216460 6218795 And yet, you know, look<br />at the two actors there
6218879 6222800 absolutely in the moment,<br />and ignoring everything else.
6233144 6235144 Did you put in, "I have wished you joy"?
6235438 6237988 Well, I…<br />I liked the line too, and I just thought:
6240317 6244803 Yeah, something he<br />actually does say to her.
6245656 6249577 We wanted to shift her<br />from a state of sort of despair
6249744 6253330 over Aragorn leaving her, which<br />Fran and I always felt made her…
6253497 6256247 Slightly weakened her,<br />that she was slightly suicidal
6256333 6259044 because some guy has<br />ridden off and left her
6259211 6264091 to actually being left by everybody<br />and everything that she loves.
6264258 6265467 Was that what we were doing?
6265551 6267471 Well, yeah, that's<br />why we put that line in,
6267513 6269429 "Why can he not fight<br />for those he loves?"
6269513 6271182 -Yes.<br />-That is a pickup scene.
6271348 6273600 -Yes, that's right.<br />-We didn't want to victimize her
6273684 6275311 in that scene.
6275478 6279482 And the first time we shot it, we…<br />We felt that she was too overwhelmed…
6279648 6281859 -Yes.<br />-…by being rejected.
6282026 6285446 -Yes.<br />-And we didn't want to overplay that part.
6285613 6288763 I liked the idea that the three<br />friends are the ones going up…
6291035 6292411 The Paths of the Dead, that they<br />don't have Elrond's sons taking it on.
6292495 6294037 -I think it's kind of…<br />-Or the rest of the Dúnedain.
6294121 6296832 Yeah, the Dúnedain. That's right…<br />Because all of the Dúnedain Rangers
6296916 6299167 all show up, don't they,<br />to be with Aragorn as well?
6299251 6302295 I think it's better that it's just<br />our principals, our three guys
6302379 6304005 it sort of just focuses it a bit more.
6304089 6309302 It just becomes very difficult to<br />introduce new people into the story.
6309386 6313336 This was a sort of interesting story thing<br />that we actually wrote about it here.
6315017 6317436 Because we thought, "My<br />God, we've got Aragorn"
6317603 6320188 who's one of their heroes,<br />who's now leaving the guys,
6320272 6322772 and they all feel that<br />he is riding with them,
6322900 6325610 and obviously riding to Minas<br />Tirith, and yet he's suddenly deviating
6325694 6327238 "off onto another path."
6327404 6329489 Which doesn't really happen<br />quite like this in the book.
6329573 6333911 And… And so we actually wrote<br />this scene to talk about exactly that
6334245 6336329 that they felt that he<br />was abandoning them.
6336413 6339792 Rather than have the audience<br />feel it and us not to address it
6339959 6341668 we actually addressed<br />it, didn't we, sort of
6341752 6344152 sort of head-on and<br />made it part of the story.
6349176 6350009 He knows now.
6354431 6355015 He knows that he is going to his death.
6355182 6359436 And he's not… He's not doing<br />it for vainglorious reasons,
6359603 6362898 but to do what he should<br />have done in the beginning
6363065 6366277 which is to leave a better world for…
6366443 6369530 Or… Or to at least give the young people
6369697 6372992 the hope of a better<br />world to leave behind.
6373158 6376458 That's why he's saying, "You shall<br />live to see these days renewed."
6376620 6380082 Which is a particularly beautiful<br />sentiment, which we always loved.
6385629 6387798 Was this directed by you,<br />Fran, and John Mahaffie?
6387882 6389132 Of principal photography.
6393137 6396237 Yeah, I think this is…<br />It's one of my favorite little scenes.
6402813 6404713 It's quiet and it's kind of dignified.
6408235 6411385 It's vulnerable, but it's not<br />hysterical, or… Or over the top.
6417661 6421361 This location is a place called the<br />Pinnacles, which is in the Wairarapa…
6423125 6425502 And it's a kind of a…<br />It's a great, distinctive
6425544 6427420 location that I have used in the past.
6427504 6430507 I shot the opening scene in<br />a film called <i>Braindead</i> here.
6431133 6432885 It… It was Skull Island.
6433052 6435596 And then when we were<br />making <i>King Kong</i> in 1996
6435763 6437931 a version of <i>Kong</i> that<br />ultimately didn't happen
6438015 6440267 we had a big set-piece action scene
6440434 6442634 that we were gonna<br />shoot on location here.
6443145 6446190 And since <i>Kong</i> was canned in those days
6446357 6450778 I still had the idea for the location<br />going into <i>Lord of the Rings,</i>
6450945 6454281 and thinking it would be a great<br />entrance to the Paths of the Dead.
6454365 6456658 What was it…<br />What were you gonna shoot <i>Kong</i> there?
6456742 6459292 -What was the scene?<br />-Oh, it was gonna be a scene…
6462539 6464750 In the version of <i>Kong</i> we're making now
6464917 6467043 we won't be able to use<br />this location a third time.
6467127 6468545 I think we… We've done it.
6468712 6473550 It's… We've popped our cookies<br />in terms of using the Pinnacles.
6473717 6475302 -But it's an amazing place.<br />-It's a…
6475386 6477805 It's a great place to<br />actually be part of.
6477972 6479622 It's a hell of a helicopter ride.
6483102 6484269 It's… It's…<br />That was one of the worst chopper…
6484353 6485979 Chopper rides we ever took, eh, Fran?
6486063 6488273 -Yeah.<br />-It was so bumpy.
6488440 6491440 -We were terrified.<br />-It was good going the day I was there…
6493737 6495322 And it was really nice. But, yeah.<br />No, helicopters aren't good
6495406 6497741 -if it's a stormy condition.<br />-It's dodgy.
6497908 6499784 And we go into this little studio set.
6499868 6502495 I quite liked this set, actually.<br />It was quite bizarre.
6502579 6505540 Had the idea of having this little<br />entrance-way, but then having
6505624 6508474 these pine trees…<br />These dead pine trees overhanging,
6508585 6511435 so it was almost like a tunnel<br />under the pine branches.
6518595 6520639 Of course, this was just a<br />little bloody tin shed, wasn't it?
6520723 6521848 -Yeah.<br />-Near the airport.
6521932 6524210 It's always difficult to make studio sets
6524252 6526854 look like they're…<br />They're really exteriors.
6527021 6529564 It always has to do with the<br />lighting, because you can't actually get
6529648 6532943 the huge degree of light<br />that you have from the sun.
6533110 6535821 And the lights of the<br />studio are too close.
6535988 6539866 They're not as far away as the sun,<br />so the angle of the light feels all wrong,
6539950 6541326 and the coverage of the light.
6541410 6543860 And it just…<br />They always look a bit fake, but…
6544455 6545747 You know, we did our best here.
6545831 6547958 We've put a lot of smoke into it,
6548709 6551002 and you try to fiddle around<br />with it in the grading as well
6551086 6554548 to color timing, to make it<br />look as realistic as possible.
6555132 6558182 I think coming off those other<br />shots of that gray landscape…
6560596 6560763 You get away with it.
6560971 6562847 That have just preceded<br />it, you know, the Pinnacles.
6562931 6564599 It… It segues it. I think it does.
6564683 6567683 Ideally you'd want a studio<br />with big skylights, wouldn't you?
6567978 6571228 Well, the higher… The… The…<br />The taller the roof, the better.
6573400 6573776 You know, if you have<br />a high ceiling on a stage
6573942 6576569 you can get some big lights<br />up top and shine them down.
6576653 6577988 Yeah.
6580699 6583327 And everything is<br />energized back at the camp.
6583494 6587956 The bit of Dunharrow that was built<br />up by Mount Victoria in an old quarry
6588123 6591126 very close to where we shot<br />the Hobbits hiding under the tree
6591210 6593545 in the very first…<br />Our very first day of shooting,
6593629 6596129 for the beginning of <i>The<br />Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
6598467 6600196 A little bit different<br />to the book, isn't it,
6600238 6601970 the way that Merry<br />gets told to stay behind?
6602054 6604764 It was sort of similar, but<br />obviously the whole Dernhelm thing
6604848 6606100 which is coming up.
6606266 6608616 I mean… I… I… I don't ever believe that…
6609353 6612355 I mean, Merry must be the stupidest<br />Hobbit on earth if he doesn't realize
6612439 6615192 that the guy that he's<br />riding with is actually Éowyn.
6615359 6619059 Because in the book he think… He<br />believes that it's Dernhelm, doesn't he?
6619196 6621281 -And we just didn't want to do that.<br />-No, we made it…
6621365 6623865 It would make Merry<br />look terribly, terribly dumb…
6623992 6626453 -Not able to recognize…<br />-Yeah.
6626620 6627912 …Miranda under the helmet.
6627996 6631625 So we changed it all to make it<br />obvious from the very beginning.
6631792 6633793 And we didn't do the<br />Dernhelm thing at all.
6633877 6637255 It was just one of… One of those story<br />things which doesn't work in the movies.
6637339 6638715 No.
6639591 6642291 The original chopper shot<br />that you're looking at now
6642386 6644429 with all the CG horses in<br />it, that was a chopper shot
6644513 6646763 of Gandalf's cart<br />heading towards Hobbiton.
6646849 6650769 I looked at everything we had shot,<br />and the best aerial shot I could think of
6650853 6653229 where we had enough flat<br />ground to put all these hundreds,
6653313 6656441 and thousands of horses, was a shot that…<br />That we had done,
6656525 6658151 and we hadn't actually<br />used it in the movie
6658235 6660653 where there was an<br />aerial shot of Gandalf's cart,
6660737 6662489 for the beginning of <i>The<br />Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
6662573 6667578 So I got Weta to paint out Gandalf's<br />cart and to put in all the CG horses.
6667744 6669746 There's no real horses there at all
6670080 6671331 they're just completely digital.
6671415 6673833 So we've extended the<br />beginning of this scene a little bit,
6673917 6676086 but there was a little<br />bit that we didn't put in
6676170 6678570 which is them finding<br />a skeleton with a torch.
6678672 6681288 You know, and… And Viggo did a little
6681330 6684261 thing with a flint and<br />got the torch going.
6684428 6686179 But even when I was<br />doing the Extended Cut
6686263 6690113 I thought that was extending it just<br />a wee bit unnecessarily too far, so…
6690642 6693687 You have this, obviously,<br />this famous speech of Legolas'
6693854 6698066 which is very evocative and… And…<br />And Orlando did a nice job, and so…
6698233 6700401 I didn't want to show any<br />of what he's talking about
6700485 6704030 because I wanted it to be more<br />from Aragorn and Gimli's point of view.
6704114 6706122 And, of course, he's, you know… He's…
6706164 6708264 Legolas is seeing<br />things that they're not.
6713081 6715667 Didn't have any close-ups of<br />John for this scene originally.
6715751 6718378 But we shot all this stuff<br />against blue screen in actual fact.
6718462 6720880 If you can imagine looking at<br />these, just, well, it was on a stage.
6720964 6722715 We didn't have any set,<br />because it was in pickups,
6722799 6724619 and we literally didn't<br />have a set finished
6724661 6726219 or any caves or tunnels or anything.
6726303 6729764 So we just shot against blue and…<br />And Weta put the set in afterwards.
6729848 6732142 It was like… This is really<br />like what filmmaking is today
6732226 6734561 where you can shoot<br />actors against blue screen,
6734645 6736355 and add everything in later on.
6736730 6739410 I… I found this ghost stuff quite tricky,
6739452 6741985 because you don't quite know what to do.
6742736 6746323 It's… You don't want to<br />get too <i>Haunted Mansion-y</i>
6746490 6749743 kind of, you know, generic ghost stuff.
6749910 6752162 And yet you have to have something.
6752329 6755248 And we sort of avoided it in<br />the theatrical cut to some degree
6755332 6757876 because I never quite knew<br />what these smoky tendrils,
6757960 6759294 and hands would be like.
6759378 6762380 And we had played it more for comedy.<br />We played it through Gimli's point of view
6762464 6765466 which I think is… If in doubt,<br />get to have a laugh with Gimli.
6765550 6768000 -It was the…<br /><i>-The John Rhys-Davies Variety Hour.</i>
6769096 6771046 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah, he was good, though, John.
6773600 6775750 -Yeah.<br />-He brings the stuff to life so well.
6778188 6780648 -Good setup on the skulls.<br />-The skulls, yeah.
6780732 6781982 His helmet looks too low.
6784778 6785153 It looks like it's crashing<br />into the bridge of his nose.
6785320 6786420 Oh, yeah, probably is.
6786863 6789783 That's… He's a lot smaller,<br />that's probably what it was.
6789950 6792619 Oh, yeah, it might be.
6800711 6803661 So this is where the theatrical<br />version obviously kicked in.
6806049 6810095 I… I find, you know… I know that we<br />were designing these ghosts for ages,
6810262 6811888 and we never quite<br />knew what to do with them.
6811972 6813640 -Yeah.<br />-And then we had this idea
6813724 6818854 of having a… A skull underneath<br />the fleshy sort of zombie makeup,
6819021 6820772 so that you morphed between the two.
6820856 6822732 And then we…<br />We were in the middle of doing that,
6822816 6826069 and <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> came<br />out, and so we all rushed to look at that,
6826153 6828154 and of course they did<br />a sort of similar thing.
6828238 6830657 But not quite the same<br />as us, but we thought:
6830824 6833159 "Oh, my God, just in the<br />year that we're trying to do
6833243 6835536 these ghost things and come<br />up with something different
6835620 6838915 you know, <i>Pirates</i> has got<br />some really nice-looking stuff."
6839082 6841251 So we… We didn't really<br />change what we were doing,
6841335 6845088 but I, you know… The ghosts were the…<br />Always the bane of my life.
6845255 6848967 I just think they're a problem story-wise,<br />because once you've got a ghost army
6849051 6850927 you've basically got<br />an unstoppable force.
6851011 6854097 You've got a… You know, an<br />immortal army that can't be killed.
6854181 6859144 And I just thought, "Well, there's no<br />dramatic tension, there's no real sense
6859311 6862564 of 'Will Aragorn triumph or not?'<br />if you have ghosts."
6862731 6865233 And so what we tried to<br />do in the original scene here
6865317 6868319 is to have the ghosts, but to not<br />have any sense of whether or not
6868403 6871353 Aragorn has actually managed to…<br />To wrangle them or not.
6871448 6873032 Which is sort of how we<br />cut the theatrical version.
6873116 6875952 There's a little bit more on<br />the tail of this Extended Cut.
6876036 6877412 Yeah.
6880332 6882250 I like the idea of the<br />ghostly city, though.
6882334 6884043 That was… I thought that was kind of neat
6884127 6888673 where you're in a big rock cavern,<br />but then not only are the ghosts visible,
6888840 6892761 but the city that they live in is sort<br />of visible in a ghostly kind of way.
6892928 6894762 The buildings are<br />almost ghosts of buildings
6894846 6896696 rather than just ghosts of people.
6896807 6899393 And so I kind of quite<br />like that idea, but…
6899559 6902509 So there's a few things in<br />here that were quite good, but…
6903313 6907275 I don't know, I just… I felt<br />particularly uninspired, I have to say…
6907442 6909319 -It's…<br />-…just in how you deal
6909486 6912336 with the ghosts in terms<br />of the narrative of the story.
6916743 6919001 …of sort of slightly <i>The Twelve Tasks of…</i>
6919043 6920893 It's a wee bit Dungeons & Dragons…
6924459 6926252 -Yeah.<br />-…in those role-playing games.
6926336 6929214 And it does get…<br />I mean, obviously Tolkien invented it,
6929381 6932383 so you can't blame him for<br />ripping off Dungeons & Dragons,
6932467 6936054 but it is just one step removed<br />from where we've been in the movies.
6936221 6938723 -Yeah.<br />-It's… Yeah…
6939182 6942982 So in the end, we… Yeah, as you<br />said, the tension of this scene ended up…
6944312 6948525 We wanted it to revolve around<br />whether Aragorn fails or not.
6948692 6952529 And to reveal at the end, at<br />the last minute, that he doesn't.
6952696 6955949 But, again, in the…<br />When it came to the theatrical, it…
6956116 6958716 It really was a case of<br />getting through this stuff
6958869 6960995 as quickly as possible, because<br />it didn't really add too much
6961079 6962706 to the story, did it?
6962873 6964523 No. And we don't… In the book…
6968336 6968628 The Army of the Dead don't<br />actually come to Minas Tirith, do they?
6968795 6973383 It's just Aragorn and the Corsair<br />ships sailing Arwen's banner
6973550 6976386 which Elrond's sons have given him.
6976553 6978971 -And it's just a little different.<br />-They do destroy the Corsairs, though.
6979055 6980755 Yeah, they destroy the Corsairs…
6984227 6986771 But then we…<br />We needed a strong enough force
6986938 6989065 to defeat the Orcs who<br />were at Minas Tirith.
6989149 6991485 -Yeah.<br />-So we decided to use the ghosts
6991651 6993695 -in that way, didn't we?<br />-Yeah.
6996865 6999534 What's interesting is that all these…<br />This whole army
6999618 7001619 got entombed in the<br />mountain, didn't they, by…
7001703 7002223 Yeah.
7002265 7006291 By Isildur many<br />hundreds of years earlier.
7009461 7012672 The shot of the skulls rolling across<br />the floor was the last thing ever shot,
7012756 7016406 for the <i>Lord of the Rings,</i> which I<br />actually shot about three weeks ago.
7016760 7020764 I shot the shot of the skulls after we<br />won the Academy Award for Best Film.
7020931 7023391 I said… Said to the guys, "It's<br />probably the only time in history
7023475 7026894 that you've finished shooting the<br />last shot after you've won the Oscar."
7026978 7029086 It's just kind of one<br />of the weird things.
7029128 7030428 There's probably rules…
7032442 7033652 All right.
7038198 7041448 So I kind of like the idea that<br />somehow you're evoking the fact…
7043328 7045455 These guys would have died,<br />they would have starved to death,
7045539 7048124 or whatever, and died<br />within the mountain.
7048291 7051753 And it's their ghosts that are…<br />That are continuing to live on.
7051920 7054422 But where are their arms and legs?
7054589 7056189 Ah, that's a very good question.
7058009 7059635 -And their ribs and their…<br />-Do you think somebody
7059719 7061387 -stacked them somewhere?<br />-Well, maybe it was just
7061471 7062638 one of those stackings,<br />one of those tombs
7062722 7064765 where somebody went along<br />afterwards and stacked all their skulls
7064849 7066893 in a big pile, and it's<br />that that's given way.
7066977 7069354 The head room. The head cave collapsed
7069521 7071689 rather than the arm cave and the leg cave
7071773 7074484 which wouldn't be as interesting-looking.
7074651 7076601 This was always a good scene, you know.
7080198 7082798 Well, it's one of those<br />situations where, you know…
7085579 7087872 Because you never know<br />whether or not, you know, he got…
7087956 7089916 -Aragorn and the guys took the ships over.<br />-True.
7090000 7092127 But here you're setting up the ships.
7092294 7096631 And of course later on we also show<br />them being taken over by the Corsairs.
7096798 7099258 So you're leaving nothing<br />to anybody's imagination.
7099342 7102721 It's… It's all being kind of<br />shown one beat at a time.
7102887 7104848 But interesting-enough scenes.
7105015 7107715 If we'd been more obedient<br />to what the book had done…
7110395 7111270 We would have suffered a terrible<br />loss of story tension, because…
7111354 7114304 Well, the book in this…<br />In the case of the Corsair ships…
7116860 7117319 And you don't know<br />who is on them, do you?
7117485 7119335 -No.<br />-You get it told in recounting
7119863 7122657 -that Aragorn took over the ships…<br />-Yeah.
7122824 7124033 …with the Army of the Dead and things.
7124117 7126494 So it's all a bit…<br />Sort of ass-about-face in the book.
7126578 7127871 Yeah.
7129998 7133292 I remember it being quite a big<br />deal to drag David behind this horse.
7133376 7136087 It was… Everyone was very worried at…<br />That if the horse bolted
7136171 7138130 he could get dragged along. And he had a…
7138214 7140800 A sort of a quick-release thing,<br />that actually in David's hand
7140884 7144136 he had a little string that was attached<br />to a little mechanism on the stirrup.
7144220 7147470 And if the horse started to…<br />To panic and take off dragging him,
7147599 7150476 …he could pull the string and in<br />theory it would release his foot.
7150560 7152562 I mean, fortunately, we never<br />had to find out if it was gonna…
7152646 7154522 If it was gonna work or not.
7155565 7158777 Like we revamped Gollum after<br /><i>Two Towers,</i> we revamped the Wargs.
7158943 7160611 We thought we'd be using<br />them more than we did,
7160695 7163155 but they're actually a hell of a lot<br />better than <i>The Two Towers</i>' Wargs.
7163239 7164824 They make you want to go<br />back and redo all of the stuff
7164908 7166242 in <i>The Two Towers</i> again.
7166326 7168578 -That's a new Warg shot.<br />-That's fantastic.
7168745 7171539 We didn't put it in the theatrical,<br />but I always quite liked it.
7171623 7172666 That was great.
7172832 7175032 What…<br />What's going on between the two Orcs?
7176002 7178602 -What are they saying?<br />-It's just him trying to be…
7181383 7183175 -His sort of pride is damaged…<br />-I love it. That's great.
7183259 7185928 …by trying to make a sexy dis…<br />Dismount off his horse.
7186012 7188431 -Oh, okay. Okay.<br />-That's fantastic.
7192435 7195897 Now, the mayor of Wellington,<br />who at the time was Mark Blumsky
7196064 7198691 the mayor of Wellington was<br />actually throwing these heads.
7198775 7201402 He came out to visit the set on<br />the day we were shooting this,
7201486 7203863 and I thought, "Oh, well, if he's…<br />If he's here to visit"
7203947 7206574 he may as well make himself helpful."<br />So we put him up on the wall with the…
7206658 7209703 With buckets of rubber heads<br />and had him toss them down.
7209869 7212419 -He was a… A severed-head-chucker.<br />-A head-tosser.
7213998 7215083 A head-tosser.
7218169 7221119 I like John's reaction, John<br />did that really well. I mean…
7223466 7224383 The thing with the character of<br />Denethor is that John was always juggling
7224467 7227567 of what's too much, what's too little?<br />And it was difficult.
7228054 7230723 He did give us lots of<br />variations in the cut, that he did
7230807 7233309 much smaller performances,<br />he did big ones.
7233476 7235662 And it…<br />It was always a bit Shakespearean,
7235704 7237426 I felt, the character of Denethor,
7237522 7239983 and I wanted to choose the moments
7240150 7243153 that had a slightly<br />Shakespearean quality to them.
7253079 7259294 We took a… A lead off our Helm's<br />Deep experience from <i>The Two Towers</i>
7259461 7264841 in trying to have the civilians<br />under attack as much as the soldiers.
7265008 7267719 Because you feel… You feel more emotion
7267886 7269929 once you see civilians<br />running and panicking
7270013 7274309 than you do if soldiers are getting hurt.<br />So we…
7274476 7276018 That's the old<br />women-and-children question.
7276102 7278354 The women-and-children question, yeah.
7278521 7280689 The Orcs have got<br />catapults, haven't they?
7280731 7282221 The Orcs have got catapults…
7284694 7286404 And they're immensely<br />powerful counterweight weapons.
7286488 7288531 We… We used it in Minas Tirith to our…
7288615 7291284 To best effect, because<br />I like the idea that the…
7291451 7294412 That the boulders that<br />Minas Tirith fires are huge.
7294579 7296580 Like, I wanted them to be<br />about the size of a house.
7296664 7298416 I mean, at the end<br />of the day, they're not
7298500 7300550 they're about the size of a small car.
7302754 7305254 I was always worried about<br />Gandalf smashing that…
7305715 7307007 -Oh, I love it, that's a…<br />-I know.
7307091 7308968 Well, I was always worried about it.<br />I thought, "Oh, God"
7309052 7310469 -people are going to hate that."<br />-It's not Tolkien.
7310553 7313703 -It's not very Tolkien at all.<br />-No, and it's very Peter Jackson.
7315225 7317825 No, no. No, no, no. It was…<br />It was… It was great.
7320313 7321480 And then the first time<br />I saw the film screened,
7321564 7323232 -so many people cheered that I…<br />-Yeah.
7323316 7326820 -It's a total film moment.<br />-Yeah, it is.
7328071 7331921 Basil, our stunt rider, did a great job<br />riding Shadowfax up onto the stairs
7333409 7335359 which he did right up the staircase.
7338206 7341334 I love the shot of the big boulder<br />landing in amongst the Orcs.
7341501 7343651 I really wanted people<br />to feel the weight,
7343753 7346464 and feel the destructive<br />power of these rocks.
7348591 7351302 This shot here is what I<br />call the <i>Pearl Harbor</i> shot.
7351469 7353971 We actually did a previs on<br />this shot about two years before
7354055 7356682 <i>Pearl Harbor</i> came out, then I<br />saw the shot from <i>Pearl Harbor</i>
7356766 7360102 with the bomb coming out of the plane<br />and going down towards the <i>Arizona.</i>
7360186 7361486 And I thought, "Oh, God"
7361646 7364064 that's our boulder shot."<br />but I thought, "Oh, well
7364148 7367318 I can't be too worried<br />about that sort of thing."
7368611 7372782 And I like the fact that the only… That<br />they have no sort of ammunition as such,
7372949 7374492 so they're ripping bits of the city off
7374576 7377996 which is why we used<br />architectural elements
7378162 7380373 of the city to be flung into the air.
7380540 7383990 It's as if their… Their…<br />The only thing they can fire at the Orcs
7385336 7389257 is bits of their own city, which<br />I thought was a… A nice idea.
7391384 7393663 I just like the way that… The brutality
7393705 7396139 of all of these huge,<br />big lumps of masonry.
7396306 7397890 Because you don't<br />normally think in movies
7397974 7401019 when people fire things from…<br />From… From catapults
7401185 7403479 you don't…<br />It doesn't really have much impact.
7403563 7408359 But I wanted to make the impact of<br />each of these things quite substantial.
7412405 7414555 And then the battle moves along in phases
7414699 7420330 because they… They initially have this<br />catapult and trebuchet kind of exchange.
7420496 7422123 And then the Nazgûls come,
7422290 7424875 and these things are really<br />like Stukas, aren't they?
7424959 7426961 Like Stuka dive-bombers and…
7427837 7431257 And flying down. And this was<br />another difficult thing to portray
7431424 7434552 not the Nazgûl themselves, but<br />the fact that they're supposed to be
7434636 7436763 spreading fear through the city.
7436930 7438639 Because, you know,<br />what can these things do?
7438723 7439923 What damage can they do?
7440016 7445229 I mean, they can obviously pluck people<br />with their claws or mouths or whatever,
7445396 7448315 but that… That's not going to make<br />a significant impact in the battle.
7448399 7451486 But what… What they're<br />supposed to do is be spreading fear,
7451653 7455782 and a loss of morale and a loss of<br />confidence through the defenders
7455949 7457491 which is the idea of the Nazgûls.
7457575 7460369 But it's, again, a very hard<br />thing to show on film, the…
7460453 7463122 You know, how do these<br />things make people scared?
7463289 7468002 And I don't know, we didn't<br />really do that fantastically well
7468419 7469670 apart from a few shots.
7469754 7472047 But I love these sorts of…<br />I just wanted this stuff…
7472131 7473591 This battle to be as dynamic as possible.
7473675 7475426 I wanted it to feel very<br />different from Helm's Deep
7475510 7477595 because I remember one of<br />the big problems we thought
7477679 7479305 we were going into<br />here, was the fact that:
7479389 7482391 We saw a battle of Helm's Deep,<br />now what can we do differently?
7482475 7485311 So we tried to stay away from<br />the iconography of Helm's Deep
7485395 7486770 with the ladders and the archers.
7486854 7489189 There's very little arrow<br />firing that happens here.
7489273 7490691 There's a wee bit, but not much
7490775 7493611 because arrow firing was<br />a signature of Helm's Deep.
7493778 7495905 -We tried to do things differently.<br />-Yeah.
7496239 7499199 I also liked the fact that the<br />attack's in daylight, for the most part.
7499283 7501368 I mean, there's a bit<br />of nighttime stuff later,
7501452 7505248 but, I… You know, it's good<br />that it's not sort of disguised
7505415 7509752 in the shroud of darkness, but in<br />this broad, you know, open day.
7511379 7513529 Oh, cool, you've got<br />the attack on the gate?
7516634 7519178 Now, obviously, you don't have<br />to explain why they bring Grond up
7519262 7520804 because Minas Tirith has got a big gate,
7520888 7523015 and they need a big… A big battering ram.
7523099 7525684 So this was a little bit redundant<br />in the sense that you don't have to
7525768 7528518 show them failing to justify<br />the appearance of Grond.
7532483 7535444 Really to give Gandalf the role<br />of a general and a commander,
7535528 7538948 and make him very hands-on,<br />we wanted the focus of the battle
7539115 7542577 to be Gandalf trying to<br />out-strategize the Orcs,
7542744 7544787 and to give him a real hands-on feeling.
7544871 7546914 And… And we wanted him to<br />get his hands dirty, as they say
7546998 7548832 rather than just be shouting out commands
7548916 7551711 to actually be doing<br />some fighting himself.
7555631 7562472 Suffice to say that this is a<br />mixture of Ian plus a stuntman
7562638 7564932 who is also doing some of the fighting.
7565516 7567685 -Although Ian was a really good sort…<br />-He is.
7567769 7569436 …in terms of throwing<br />himself into this, he…
7569520 7571022 -Yeah.<br />-He would, you know
7571189 7573732 -he'd really give it a go.<br />-He's pretty good with a sword.
7573816 7574233 -…he'd really give it a go.<br />-He's pretty good with a sword.
7574400 7577300 Battles are always much more<br />interesting if you see them…
7579781 7580448 And obviously we wanted to<br />do some of it through Pippin
7580615 7584118 not just about Gandalf, but also<br />have Pippin's experience of war.
7584285 7588498 I know Fran actually shot some<br />of the images of Pippin panicking,
7588664 7594295 and people running past him and<br />being knocked over, just to try to feel
7594462 7597562 that we were seeing something<br />from a Hobbit's point of view.
7597882 7602970 The thing about Mordor is that you<br />have to admire their tenacity, don't you?
7603054 7605472 -What, they just keep on attacking?<br />-They keep on coming.
7605556 7607266 -Yeah, I mean they have great kind of…<br />-They sort of channel that…
7607350 7609602 Channel that hatred as best they can.
7609769 7613269 -Yeah, they're very goal-focused.<br />-They probably go to psychiatrists…
7616109 7618902 So they can sort of work themselves up.<br />Sort of anti-psychiatrists.
7618986 7620486 I admire their relentlessness.
7620696 7624324 -Are you relating to the Orcs, Franny?<br />-I'm afraid I am.
7624408 7626202 -Has it come to this?<br />-Yes.
7627245 7630295 Well, with Grond we wanted it<br />to be towed by some creatures…
7632542 7633751 Because no one else knew what…
7633835 7635711 Oh, actually, Tolkien<br />talks about "great beasts."
7635795 7638464 He says, "And great<br />beasts are pulling Grond."
7638631 7642134 So he did have something in the<br />book, but nothing to give you any clue
7642218 7644137 as to what these great beasts were.
7644345 7648141 So Weta went to considerable<br />lengths to actually sculpt and design
7648307 7651018 a maquette and scan<br />it and build these things
7651185 7654564 which only ended up<br />being in one or two shots.
7656669 7659169 So here we are at the<br />beginning of the second disc.
7659630 7663030 -We're only halfway through.<br />-And I can't believe that some of you…
7663718 7665761 Shouldn't you get some<br />sleep or something and maybe
7665845 7667680 come back tomorrow?
7668765 7671392 This was the cameo scene, wasn't it?<br />Where everybody thought
7671476 7673769 it would be fun to dress<br />up as a pirate for the day.
7673853 7677315 We've got Andrew Lesnie, our<br />DP, Rick Porras, co-producer
7677482 7680610 Richard Taylor and Gino from<br />Weta Workshop were there.
7680777 7683077 You don't really need<br />this scene at all, but…
7683946 7686646 -Not… Not at all.<br />-No, I think "painful" is a good…
7691788 7694331 Look, I did a big fall onto<br />the deck, a big stunt fall,
7694415 7697665 and I didn't… I refused to have<br />any knee pads or elbow pads,
7697794 7700544 and I just hit the deck each time.<br />It hurt like hell.
7700797 7702715 -But we didn't even see it.<br />-Well, no. No.
7702799 7706199 What's the point in suffering for<br />your art if we don't get to see it?
7707595 7710306 The body fall was quite loud.
7711224 7713674 -What?<br />-No, that's the moment at which the film…
7717271 7721192 You know, a fantasy movie<br />into a Monty Python moment.
7721359 7722985 We…
7725822 7727364 There's nothing wrong<br />with Monty Python, though.
7727448 7729617 Underachievers.
7731160 7734246 I just want to say that while this was<br />going on, what were we doing, Fran?
7734330 7737875 -We were… We were trying to…<br />-Trying to save the film
7739001 7741504 from the clutches of the pirates.
7749929 7754308 I'm most proud of the way that he acts,<br />if you like, if you can call it acting
7754475 7756018 which it obviously is.
7756185 7760314 The subtleties and beautiful<br />animation, beautiful animation.
7760481 7764235 And obviously Andy Serkis<br />gave us the reference.
7764443 7766779 It's one of the last Gollum<br />scenes that we did too.
7766863 7771075 It's sort of the culmination of Gollum.<br />It's as good as Gollum ever got.
7773286 7775788 One of the pieces of design that I<br />wanted to do with Shelob's tunnel
7775872 7780376 was to make the ground undulating<br />so that you walk uphill and downhill
7780543 7783212 as you're making your way through<br />the tunnel. Because often in studios
7783296 7786006 you know, people think about the<br />round caves, but they… They think…
7786090 7788967 They sort of end up being<br />quite flat on the floor of a studio,
7789051 7792471 so I deliberately wanted to make it…<br />Which sort of comes across here
7792555 7795057 the way that you go around.<br />And those cobwebs…
7795224 7799478 Cobwebs are quite difficult. They were<br />made of some weird epoxy, rubbery stuff.
7800646 7806152 I like the bony kind of debris on<br />the floor too, little hints and clues.
7810781 7814159 And a lot of this stuff is supposed to<br />be us seeing things before Frodo does.
7814243 7817496 So we start to see<br />skeletons and bits of remains
7817663 7820124 before Frodo realizes quite where he is.
7822960 7825421 Is that a Gollum POV, or is that a…
7828966 7832386 Yeah, I kind of…<br />Though it could be anything, of course.
7834013 7835806 And I remember one<br />of the character things
7835890 7837599 we were worried about with this sequence
7837683 7839393 was just to redeem Frodo in some respects
7839477 7842813 because the previous scenes we've<br />seen of him, he's sort of sent Sam home.
7842897 7844273 He's acted like a real bastard.
7844357 7846692 And now we wanted to help<br />suddenly get sympathy back for him.
7846776 7849570 So we just had to sort of fine-tune it.
7854450 7856786 …non-idealized view of womanhood.
7861958 7865008 -She's got hairy legs.<br />-Well, she can't… She hasn't shaved
7865503 7868839 and… And she's having a bit of<br />trouble squeezing through places
7868923 7871258 she could get through before.
7871592 7873386 So we had some sympathy for her.
7882728 7884878 …because this never<br />happened in the books.
7885022 7887983 We didn't want to feel like Sam<br />was coming to the rescue as such
7888067 7890110 because otherwise it would<br />take a lot of the tension away
7890194 7892446 from what was happening to Frodo.
7894782 7897582 If anyone looking at this movie has…<br />Still has doubts
7897702 7900203 that, you know, Shelob should have<br />been at the end of <i>The Two Towers</i>
7900287 7904000 I just say, well, look at what<br />happens from this point on
7904166 7905834 till the end for Frodo and Sam,
7905918 7910088 and imagine that being their<br />entire story in <i>Return of the King.</i>
7910172 7912299 You actually… If you stop and<br />think about it, you just couldn't do it.
7912383 7914885 You couldn't actually… You'd end<br />up having half of <i>Return of the King</i>
7914969 7917669 in <i>Two Towers,</i> if that's<br />what you wanted to do, so…
7931444 7933487 You're running in some<br />syrup and you can't get away.
7933571 7935948 It's like one of those<br />nightmarish situations
7936115 7939410 where it's just pulling you down<br />and dragging you down and…
7945875 7948752 Being a lot of fun to shoot,<br />because it is… It's where you can just…
7948836 7951213 You can have fun as a<br />filmmaker, because you can indulge
7951297 7953465 in all your own fears<br />and all your own anxieties.
7953549 7957303 And… And I'm terrified of spiders.<br />I hate cobwebs. I hate all that stuff.
7957470 7963893 And I kind of had a lot of fun trying to<br />just make a scene that was scary for me.
7964351 7968522 And we finally get the<br />Galadriel phial, the starlight
7968689 7971233 paid off after setting<br />it up all that time ago.
7972068 7974319 The first image of Shelob I wanted<br />to do was something that I'd seen
7974403 7978532 in National Geographic documentaries,<br />which was looking down a little
7978699 7980751 spider hole and seeing a group of legs
7980793 7983162 bunched in the<br />darkness, sort of just legs.
7983329 7985163 -Disgusting.<br />-I wanted that to be the first image,
7985247 7990211 and then have her sort of coming<br />out of the hole and see her full size.
8000262 8003181 There's this horrible spider we<br />have in our gardens in New Zealand.
8003265 8007353 It's quite small. It's about an inch<br />long, and it's a sort of tunnel-web.
8007520 8009939 And when I was a kid at Pukerua Bay.<br />We always…
8010106 8012024 I always used to find<br />these things in the garden.
8012108 8014651 And I used to be digging around<br />the garden a lot, because I used to
8014735 8017135 dig trenches to do<br />World War I battle films…
8017279 8020324 -As you do.<br />-…and dig little roads and tunnels,
8020491 8022034 for my Matchbox toys and stuff.
8022118 8024870 And… And these bloody<br />tunnel-webs, they live in holes,
8024954 8030167 and I'd always find them.<br />And I'd run screaming away and run for Dad
8030376 8033776 because he wasn't scared of spiders.<br />And he could get rid of them.
8034547 8036381 No, funnel-webs are a<br />different type of spider.
8036465 8040115 But a tunnel-web is that little thing<br />with the orange body with the fat…
8045015 8047809 And all of the Americans that<br />work at Weta obviously didn't know
8047893 8050771 what I was talking about, but<br />Christian Rivers went home,
8050855 8054691 and he dug around in his garden, and<br />he brought one to work in a glass jar.
8054775 8056526 -Oh, wow.<br />-The following day he'd found one…
8056610 8058695 He'd got one out of his garden.<br />And he's terrified of spiders too,
8058779 8060906 so it was a really brave<br />thing that Christian did.
8060990 8064076 And we had that at Weta<br />as the model for Shelob.
8070624 8075963 He's got bungees around<br />his arms and ankles, and he's…
8076130 8079257 We kind of… We… I don't even know<br />what the cobwebs were made of,
8079341 8082260 but they're made of this<br />stringy-like, almost like hot melt glue.
8082344 8084054 And we used to have<br />sheets of the cobwebs that
8084138 8087683 every time we did a take.<br />We'd have to reapply cobwebs.
8087850 8091020 And all of the stretchiness of<br />the cobwebs was… Was there.
8091187 8092938 That was what it was…<br />The stuff was really like.
8093022 8097067 It was super stretchy, but<br />like SuperBall-type material.
8100029 8103199 We were always wanting to<br />use Andy Serkis as reference.
8103365 8105951 And so we shot this scene very late.
8106118 8109872 It was almost one of the last scenes<br />that we shot for <i>Return of the King.</i>
8110039 8112124 And then we went to London to<br />do scoring with Howard Shore,
8112208 8115586 and Weta was animating the scene.<br />And so we didn't really
8115753 8119053 have the proper reference we<br />needed from Andy for the close-ups.
8119423 8121842 So we had Andy come to the house<br />in London that we were staying in,
8121926 8124344 and we…<br />And I had just got my Handycam camera
8124428 8127139 my video camera, and I… And we videoed
8127473 8131185 Andy lying on the floor in the<br />hallway of this house in London,
8131352 8134312 and videoed his performance of<br />the shots that you're seeing now
8134396 8136773 these close-ups of<br />Gollum looking up at Frodo.
8136857 8140778 And we then cut those into the<br />Avid and we sent those back to Weta
8140945 8143614 as the guide for the animators.
8148869 8151288 Gollum always knows the Ring is<br />going to be destroyed, doesn't he?
8151372 8154772 And he just wants to sort of change<br />his mind. Or does he not realize?
8154959 8156293 -No, not really, not in time.<br />-No, but we felt that it was important
8156377 8158795 -because we have a lot of…<br />-No, Frodo tells him.
8158879 8160979 At what… At what point does he tell him?
8163384 8167429 "You will never have it, and I'm<br />here to destroy it." And, you know…
8173060 8177898 It sort of just is a bit weird because<br />Gollum would be so against destroying it.
8178065 8180358 But Gollum is not sure why<br />they want to go to Mordor,
8180442 8182861 and he's just leading them there.<br />But obviously just with the hope
8182945 8185280 at one point… At some point<br />he's going to snatch the Ring.
8185364 8190119 But he's not entirely sure why<br />they want to go, and he doesn't ask.
8190286 8191620 Well, they don't tell him.
8191787 8195123 But there has to be that moment where<br />he realizes what Frodo is going to do.
8195207 8198627 And he realizes that the Ring,<br />the actual existence of the Ring
8198794 8202840 not just for himself, but the<br />existence is in jeopardy, is in danger
8203007 8206385 because Frodo is now<br />bent on destroying it.
8207636 8211181 I always liked this moment, and we<br />didn't actually have Cate Blanchett
8211265 8214310 with us at the time that<br />we shot Elijah in the forest.
8214476 8216811 That's a real forest on the South<br />Island, and we did it as a pickup,
8216895 8222609 so we used one of our<br />focus pullers, Jac Fitzgerald.
8222776 8228615 She put on Galadriel's costume, and<br />it's her… It's her that's standing here.
8228782 8232911 And this is obviously a shot of Cate<br />Blanchett we did a long time earlier.
8233078 8235831 But we used Jac for the person
8235998 8240085 who actually reaches<br />down and offers her hand.
8241628 8243630 We felt it was important to remind people
8243714 8246675 that Galadriel was entrusting<br />this mission to Frodo.
8246842 8249928 And it was just a way of<br />re-motivating Frodo, wasn't it?
8250095 8252472 -I love it. It's…<br />-Taking him from the point of despair
8252556 8255351 into re-energizing him<br />back on his mission again.
8261523 8264234 He has to keep going.<br />And she's kind of saying to him:
8264902 8267654 "You can't do this.<br />You have to keep going."
8278999 8282544 It's just a moment that<br />further develops the friendship
8282711 8285547 between Éowyn and<br />Merry, and tells us something
8285714 8288925 about what these characters are<br />feeling on the eve of their own battle
8289009 8290844 that they're heading towards.
8299019 8300938 -Yeah.<br />-I like their performances.
8301105 8305651 It's just unfortunate that…<br />That in terms of the narrative momentum
8305818 8308487 it sort of slowed things<br />down at a time when
8308654 8311323 we couldn't afford to<br />have it in the theatrical.
8311490 8313325 -No.<br />-It was really nice.
8317913 8322251 -…between her and Merry.<br />-Yeah.
8322418 8325418 It's also when she says.<br />"Courage, Merry, for our friends"
8325546 8330634 before she rides into battle.<br />She's actually referencing this moment.
8337141 8340310 I like that scene too, because the<br />look in there… What Dominic does
8340394 8343730 with that performance is…<br />Earns that great line that Théoden says.
8343814 8346692 He's terrified, but he's<br />going into battle nonetheless.
8346859 8349778 And they realize that he's… This<br />little Hobbit is absolutely terrified,
8349862 8351780 but that he's gonna go and fight anyway.
8351864 8354950 And I think that's what that<br />moment is about as well.
8360122 8362874 Hopefully it doesn't look like we<br />did, but it was used extensively
8362958 8366295 in <i>Two Towers,</i> obviously, for<br />all the Rohan, the Warg battle,
8366462 8368421 and the refugees moving<br />across the mountains.
8368505 8372468 A great location.<br />It's out of Queenstown, in New Zealand.
8374803 8377973 So returning to our medieval<br />history, these are now catapults
8378140 8380225 as opposed to trebuchets.
8380392 8384646 And Geoff Murphy shot a lot<br />of this fireball stuff, didn't he
8384813 8387649 -the fireballs landing in the city?<br />-Yes, it was.
8387816 8389610 Done on our set.
8391320 8394270 -Is that all CGI there? That's all…<br />-That's all CGI, yeah.
8395741 8397951 We often shot the miniature Minas Tirith,
8398118 8400913 and then we projected<br />the miniature footage
8401079 8406710 onto a computer model of the city,<br />so we could get some different angles,
8406877 8409337 and slightly different<br />camera moves if we had to.
8409421 8410839 Grond is a big miniature
8411089 8412739 that is about 8 or 9 foot long.
8414551 8419431 And this…<br />This set, which was the Court of the Kings
8419598 8421391 was actually right<br />next to a railway station.
8421475 8425771 It was built basically in the same<br />parking lot as the Osgiliath ruins,
8425938 8430776 and our wet set was built,<br />out in the Hutt Valley, Wingate.
8433612 8439785 Now we're finally getting to put<br />Faramir's life in jeopardy again.
8439952 8441578 Oh, this is a new shot, the tree.
8441662 8443788 We never quite figured out<br />how to use the tree in the movie,
8443872 8447668 but that shot of the bloom<br />was supposed to be just a clue
8447834 8449669 wasn't it, that the king was returning.
8449753 8452672 And no matter what Denethor<br />was doing, or thought he was doing
8452756 8456006 there was no way he could<br />stop the inevitability of the fate
8456510 8458428 of that fact that Aragorn<br />was now heading back there.
8458512 8461181 It's almost like he's…<br />Aragorn commands the ghost army
8461265 8463725 he's heading towards<br />Minas Tirith, and so the tree
8463809 8466436 just pops out one little flower, so… Pop.
8466603 8468553 -And…<br />-It seems a bit premature to me.
8469064 8471774 -Yeah. Well, the tree…<br />-It's a beautiful moment. I like it.
8471858 8473694 -It's an optimistic tree.<br />-It is.
8476321 8478156 "…so I might just have<br />one little flower come out."
8478240 8479516 But we never quite figured out… I don't
8479558 8480909 know quite what the<br />rules of the tree are,
8480993 8483593 and aren't, and it doesn't<br />really matter, does it?
8494006 8496132 …in such a way that you<br />had to cross this viaduct…
8496216 8498676 …this bridge, to go to what<br />was essentially the cemetery…
8498760 8500720 …which was on the mountainside<br />at the back of the city.
8500804 8503223 And something just wonderful<br />about the tombs and graveyards.
8503307 8505058 I remember in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>
8505142 8508687 we had the Dwarf graveyard and Moria.<br />And you have this old tombs.
8508854 8513650 In fact, in <i>Kong</i> we're planning on having<br />a big graveyard cemetery on Skull Island.
8513817 8516194 And they're gonna come across it.<br />Something evocative,
8516278 8518405 and spooky about this.
8531710 8534712 The Wargs are quite subtle.<br />You don't really see them that much.
8534796 8537549 They're in a few shots, but the trolls<br />obviously are a bit more noticeable.
8537633 8541052 So these shots were done very quickly.<br />They were done in, like, the last
8541136 8544765 two, three, four weeks of<br />post-production on the film.
8544931 8549561 We had some plates, and some of<br />the plates were not shot with the idea
8549728 8553398 of putting trolls into them. But we<br />managed to squeeze trolls in nonetheless,
8553482 8556943 and just make it seem like<br />that all of the forces of Mordor
8557110 8561323 were just rampaging into the city.<br />Make it as desperate as possible.
8561490 8565494 It was one of those sequences where<br />we didn't have… We didn't really shoot it
8565661 8568622 in an incredibly planned kind of way.
8568789 8570989 But it… It… We managed to take the shots,
8571500 8574200 and put them together in a<br />reasonably good sequence.
8575295 8578089 I wanted Shelob to be very old.<br />I wanted her to be ancient.
8578173 8580030 That was the idea<br />with all the growths and
8580072 8581926 the sort of little tumor-y kind of things
8582010 8584429 on her face, just to make<br />her feel like she's been around,
8584513 8586139 for God knows how long.
8596566 8598276 -It's a great shot.<br />-Which was an idea we had on the set.
8598360 8600821 We were playing around<br />with the wide-angle lens,
8600987 8603740 and the camera on a crane, and we<br />were just looking for interesting angles.
8603824 8606075 And we came up with this angle, we…<br />And then we decided
8606159 8609162 to make it…<br />To really feature it as a shot.
8610706 8613207 This is an image that's off one<br />of Alan Lee's paintings, isn't it
8613291 8618130 off… On <i>The Two Towers</i> cover.<br />Looking up the staircase.
8618296 8620632 But I like the fact that the<br />spider is being really creepy,
8620716 8626221 and sneaky and spooky. And this…<br />This is the one that gets a great gasp.
8629683 8632310 And Elijah was great.<br />They gave him some Alka-Seltzer tablets
8632394 8635856 which he had in his mouth,<br />which is what creates the foam
8636022 8637857 that he put two of these<br />big tablets in his mouth,
8637941 8640777 and just worked up all the<br />foam and just squeezed out
8640861 8644114 the… The saliva at the right time.
8644281 8650662 And Frodo has become a digital<br />double here, the CG version of Frodo.
8651955 8654499 Now, the hand that comes<br />in here when Sam appears
8654583 8657126 is actually not Sean Astin's hand.<br />We won't… We won't talk about
8657210 8658753 whose hand it is, but<br />I guess if you watch…
8658837 8661687 If you watch the documentary<br />material, you might find out.
8663133 8665176 This was tough for Sean.<br />Because, obviously
8665260 8668910 like any of these monster fights,<br />you know, you're reacting to nothing.
8669014 8672934 And this… This fight was shot<br />back in principal photography,
8673101 8675311 and we really didn't know<br />what Shelob was gonna look like.
8675395 8677606 In fact, Shelob was<br />designed at the very end.
8677773 8680858 I mean, all the way through the<br />shooting, we never had Shelob…
8680942 8683027 Even a drawing of<br />Shelob, particularly, and…
8683111 8687115 And we only really worked on<br />her design this last 12 months.
8687282 8690535 Sean was literally just going<br />for it and not having a clue
8690702 8694414 what he was really<br />reacting to or acting against.
8699795 8703632 …that he grabbed hold of, so we<br />could see his hands grabbing something.
8703799 8706799 -But they weren't mandibles.<br />-Some of this… This was later.
8707469 8710346 -This was shot in pickup.<br />-A couple of these shots were later, yeah.
8710430 8713642 And that's a transfer from a<br />digital double to Sean Astin
8713809 8715810 where it's a digital<br />double rolling off the back,
8715894 8719564 and then when he lands, we do<br />a little morph into the real actor.
8723318 8725403 I thought the animators<br />did a great job with this
8725487 8728072 after the stab. I mean, that<br />looks like a real wounded spider.
8728156 8730656 Not that I've ever seen a<br />spider wounded like that.
8737958 8741711 …who were concentrating on… On Shelob…
8741962 8745465 -…that really managed to capture…<br />-It's genius.
8745841 8749678 …a good spider. I just wanted<br />it to feel like a real spider too.
8749845 8753682 That it wasn't one of those<br />kind of movie, robotic things.
8753849 8755684 I wanted it to scuttle and move.
8755851 8757352 It moves fast. It moves slow.
8757519 8760147 It does… You know, it's totally motivated
8760189 8762858 by what… By what she's trying to achieve.
8778248 8781751 -Sort of. They're related to her.<br />-They all descended off the same…
8781918 8785213 -Ungoliant.<br />-Ungoliant, who was with Shelob when…
8785380 8787965 -I don't even know how to say it.<br />-Is that sort of <i>The Silmarillion?</i>
8788049 8790510 -Like a sort of… That was the…<br />-She's a Maiar.
8791720 8794264 -That was a god…<br />-Like the Balrog, yeah.
8797893 8799602 -She's a descendant, yeah.<br />-…off of her, yeah.
8799686 8803086 So Shelob is a descendant and the<br />ones in <i>The Hobbit</i> are descendants.
8804482 8808653 Shelob, she's more,<br />you know, of this world.
8817746 8822125 I don't know how he went to the<br />toilet, but he couldn't go to the toilet.
8822292 8824461 Not that I was aware of. He was…
8824628 8827004 He was literally wrapped<br />up in this stuff in the morning,
8827088 8829758 and had to just sort of…<br />Because it was just…
8829925 8832510 It took so long, and we couldn't<br />sort of slip him in and out of it.
8832594 8836389 He was just bundled up<br />like this for a long, long time.
8837599 8840018 He couldn't even scratch his nose.
8845440 8848401 So was this Sean Astin's<br />audition scene, wasn't it?
8851529 8853323 And, actually, Sean struggled.
8853490 8856367 I was a bit dubious, I remember,<br />how he would handle the English stuff.
8856451 8858369 Actually, what was funny<br />was a lot of the English actors
8858453 8860872 who were auditioning<br />found this scene really hard.
8860956 8863124 Sean Astin just nailed it.
8863792 8865794 It was really moving.
8877806 8881226 Steven has played Orcs before for us.<br />He was…
8881393 8883436 He did a couple of<br />Orcs in <i>The Two Towers.</i>
8883520 8885939 And Peter Tait is actually<br />the Corsair captain
8886106 8888900 the guy sitting on the<br />bridge of the Corsair ship.
8889067 8893446 And he did this other role for us.<br />Obviously, in makeup, as the Uruk-hai.
8901413 8903289 Always difficult to make<br />these Orcs feel real,
8903373 8905667 but I really like what Steven does.
8906626 8909420 And this is pretty much the<br />moment that <i>The Two Towers</i> novel
8909504 8911554 actually ends, isn't it, with Frodo
8911673 8913425 -being carried away?<br />-Yes. Yes.
8913591 8916177 So if you were being<br />strictly accurate to the book
8916261 8918711 that would have been the<br />end of <i>The Two Towers.</i>
8923685 8926479 "The Choices of Master Samwise."
8939784 8942328 …on the top of the pyre,<br />that we thought to save him…
8942412 8946249 …having to spend literally days<br />and days just lying on top of a pyre…
8946416 8949627 And of course there was situations where<br />there were going to be flames as well
8949711 8952421 that we built a dummy.<br />And a lot of the shots that you're seeing
8952505 8955132 are actually the silicone dummy.<br />The very big close-ups of his face
8955216 8957927 are the real David Wenham.<br />Anything that's not in a big close-up is…
8958011 8961556 Is this incredibly realistic dummy<br />that we just used to save him the…
8961723 8964059 The trouble of having to lie there.
8967979 8969814 Yeah, that was a little in-camera cheat…
8969898 8972798 -That's really clever.<br />-…because we had… We had Kiran…
8974944 8977947 Already in position, so he<br />could just pop up at the right time.
8978031 8979699 Actually it was Fon. It was Fon that got…
8979783 8982833 Another one of our scale<br />doubles that actually got thrown out.
8983119 8985169 -She always did Pippin, didn't she?<br />-Yeah.
8991503 8993963 …amongst the big people is usually Fon.
8994130 8997634 And Kiran did Frodo pretty<br />much, didn't he? Yeah.
8998635 9001512 Billy worked very closely with<br />Fon, who was a female, a lady.
9001596 9004182 And Billy really got on well with her,
9004349 9008061 and instructed her how to walk<br />like him and perform like him.
9008228 9009729 And she was very, very good.
9009896 9013024 Some of these shots of Gandalf<br />were little pickups that we did.
9013274 9015860 Because we had all these<br />wonderful, big wide shots
9015944 9020782 great, you know, vistas, but we didn't<br />really have much coverage of Ian himself,
9020949 9023118 so we set up a little shoot,
9023284 9027455 and did some close-ups of him<br />giving orders and instructions.
9027622 9030207 Then we shot some of these<br />big miniature shots, which were
9030291 9033962 again, to make the…<br />Break the picture open.
9035130 9037880 This little sequence here<br />was one where we added trolls.
9037966 9041594 They were all shots that were done<br />never intending for trolls to be in them.
9041678 9044430 But I gave them to Weta, and I<br />said, "Can you just sneak me in a troll
9044514 9047976 "here and there?" And you'll see<br />a few shots coming through here
9048143 9054190 where we do… We do just sneak<br />in the occasional CG monster.
9059028 9061726 It was important in<br />the story to try to build
9061768 9064325 the despair, to try to<br />really make it seem
9064492 9067704 like this battle was really…<br />Was turning into a defeat
9067871 9069955 that it was… They were on the back foot
9070039 9074502 the Gondorians and Gandalf,<br />and that it was fairly hopeless
9074669 9078631 because it gives a value, obviously.<br />To the arrival of Théoden.
9085138 9089017 …with the Extended Cut.<br />The Extended Cut changes the story.
9089184 9090935 It does a little bit, yeah.
9091102 9094397 We always thought Gandalf<br />would react to this showdown
9094564 9097525 with the Witch-king, and that the…
9097692 9099819 The Rohirrim would<br />turn up at that moment.
9102030 9103656 -Yes.<br />-…in our script, and we altered it,
9103740 9106784 for the theatrical version, but…<br />You know, the confrontation with
9106868 9109578 the Witch-king was something…<br />I can't remember why we didn't put it in
9109662 9112462 -the theatrical version.<br />-Because it didn't ever work.
9114459 9117109 It's… In the book it works<br />on a different level and…
9119839 9123389 About a character who arrives,<br />threatens to do something, and then
9123509 9126554 flies away again, having not actually…
9126721 9130183 Well, he broke Gandalf's staff,<br />but there was just the sense…
9130350 9133853 Made him less frightening.<br />And less potent as a character.
9134062 9136438 It was like an event that<br />threatened to happen but then didn't.
9136522 9139525 And we really felt it in<br />the pacing of the film.
9141778 9143404 …and more kind of exciting.
9145031 9147271 -"I'm gonna wait to<br />kill you, even though…"
9147313 9148581 -"I'll come back to you."
9151871 9155500 I mean, I like the stuff on<br />Mount Doom with Frodo and Sam.
9155667 9160255 But for some reason, this scene,<br />I feel most proud of this scene.
9161923 9165885 It's weird where things happen, because,<br />you know, this is obviously in the book,
9165969 9167344 and it's something that<br />we were working on.
9167428 9170097 I remember when we were<br />working on the script for this
9170181 9173559 when we were writing the script for<br />Miramax. It would have been about 1997.
9173643 9176437 I remember on a Sunday afternoon we took
9176604 9180441 our kids out to their grandparents…<br />Out to my mother and father's house.
9180608 9185446 And I remember going for a<br />quiet walk in their garden by myself.
9185613 9189450 And this scene, which I guess we<br />must have just been writing at that time…
9189617 9192078 This scene just played<br />itself out in my head,
9192245 9195206 and I suddenly got the<br />idea for all the different shots,
9195290 9198626 and all the angles and all the moments.<br />Just sort of the whole scene
9198710 9201629 came together in that garden.
9201796 9204632 And I just hung on to that memory.
9204799 9207885 I didn't write it down.<br />I just had it ingrained in my head.
9208052 9212974 It was about four years later that I was<br />actually in Twizel, in the South Island
9213141 9217895 shooting the scene. And then<br />another three years after I shot it
9218062 9220397 before it was actually<br />released in the movie.
9220481 9225695 I just have… This particular<br />scene has this long gestation.
9225862 9228656 For that reason I'm very fond of it.
9230408 9233410 It was Bernard's idea…<br />Bernard Hill's idea, who's playing Théoden
9233494 9237832 to do this rattle along the spears.<br />This was an idea that came late.
9237999 9240793 And it happened…<br />Virtually, you know, for me
9240960 9244755 it was something Bernard suggested<br />just before we were due… Due to shoot it.
9244839 9248384 He'd come up with the idea of<br />riding along and… And… And dragging
9248551 9250844 the sword along the spears.<br />He thought it was almost
9250928 9254181 like something that Théoden does<br />to raise the morale of his troops.
9254265 9256684 It was a really neat idea.<br />It was hard for Bernard to do
9256768 9259687 because he's left-handed.<br />And yet I wanted him to ride
9259771 9263023 towards the camera, so I remember<br />the look on his face, because he had
9263107 9266457 rehearsed it with the horses,<br />holding the sword in his left hand.
9266694 9268904 And I said, "Well, hang on, Bernard.<br />The camera is here.
9268988 9271783 The horses are here, and<br />if you use your left hand
9271949 9273784 you're gonna have to<br />be riding away from us.
9273868 9278373 But I want you riding towards us, because<br />that's how it's gonna look the best."
9278539 9281417 And so, suddenly, he<br />had to have the sword
9281584 9284795 in the hand he's not used to<br />holding it in, which really threw him.
9284879 9288674 But he managed to make it work very well.
9289384 9293053 And it also shows… I mean, from a<br />purely cinematic point of view, it shows
9293137 9296224 the scale of these horse charges.<br />This is 6000 horses
9296391 9299059 which is exactly what<br />Tolkien describes in the book.
9299143 9302271 And interestingly, you know, you<br />see 6000 horses in those one or two
9302355 9305441 big wide shots that we have here.<br />And, interestingly enough, in…
9305525 9310405 In Napoleonic battles, the Battle of<br />Waterloo, the French heavy cavalry
9310571 9313533 that charged the English was 6000
9313866 9315951 horses, exactly… Exactly the same size.
9316035 9320248 So this is historically what<br />these battles used to be like.
9320415 9323835 I mean, unbelievable seeing<br />6000 horses in one spot.
9327630 9328840 -Stunning.<br />-Yeah.
9329006 9331508 It works so beautifully<br />with the spirit of the charge.
9331592 9332885 Yeah.
9337765 9340267 …up on the hill. And then from<br />the time the horses start charging…
9340351 9343729 …Geoff Murphy did a lot of the<br />shooting of the actual horse charge…
9343813 9346190 …which we're obviously tracking<br />vehicles with cameras in the back…
9346274 9348108 …of the vehicle, driving at high speed.
9348192 9352780 We had to prepare a whole big field<br />in Twizel for the horses to get up on
9352947 9355657 because one of the most<br />dangerous things in scenes like this…
9355741 9358452 And it's gonna sound silly, but you<br />have to think about it for a moment
9358536 9360413 are actually rabbit holes.
9360580 9362352 That if you are out<br />on the South Island of
9362394 9364208 New Zealand, there<br />is a plague of rabbits.
9364292 9366293 And there were just<br />rabbit holes everywhere.
9366377 9368379 And you have horses<br />galloping at high speed
9368463 9372925 they put… One horse puts a foot down a<br />rabbit hole, one, you are going to injure
9373092 9376592 that horse terrifically.<br />But if you are in the middle of a charge
9376679 9379723 you are also gonna have all<br />the other horses piling up, and so
9379807 9383728 we had to be incredibly vigilant, and<br />we had to go over and over and over
9383895 9386939 this field with a fine-toothed comb<br />to make sure that all the rabbit holes
9387023 9389149 were filled in, because we<br />had to fill them in with dirt,
9389233 9390901 and prepare it. And it's dangerous.
9390985 9394906 It's very dangerous to be<br />galloping at a high speed like this.
9399577 9402079 Here's John back in his<br />Shakespearean mode.
9402246 9406959 He did very, very well in just<br />managing to get the fine balance
9407126 9411005 I think, between a… You know, a<br />fully Shakespearean-size performance,
9411172 9416219 and keeping some element of reality to it.<br />It was a real tough role to play.
9419680 9423030 -…over a very expensive wig.<br />-Well, that's right, and we didn't…
9425144 9427344 …and do all that, so<br />we got it in one take.
9430066 9431692 Oh, it probably did.
9441869 9444997 None of this really is happening<br />in quite the way that you see it.
9445081 9449710 But if you look at the shot-by-shot,<br />we just edit together little tiny pieces
9449877 9452379 because it was dangerous, and there<br />was fire, and there were scale doubles,
9452463 9454798 and there were…<br />You know, there were all sorts of reasons
9454882 9459220 why this was real<br />tough to actually stage.
9461180 9463849 And so we never staged<br />it as a complete sequence.
9464016 9466894 We just did tiny pieces<br />of it and cut them together
9467061 9468979 which is all that you<br />have to do, obviously.
9469063 9471273 We added a few CG flames in.<br />Here and there,
9471357 9473568 but most of the flames<br />were actually real.
9478072 9481075 His father can look<br />into the eyes of that son,
9481242 9484954 and see his own failure, and<br />that for a parent like Denethor
9485121 9487915 it's like looking into a<br />mirror and receiving back
9488082 9490251 -the bad version of yourself.<br />-Yeah.
9493754 9496715 …the horse rearing up, kicking<br />its hooves with nobody there.
9496799 9499009 And then as a separate pass.<br />We shot the stuntman being
9499093 9504724 jerked back onto the pyre.<br />And we combined the two elements.
9504890 9508102 And this was just another image<br />that I had in my head way back
9508269 9511606 at the very beginning.<br />As I just wanted the flaming Denethor
9511772 9514692 to jump off the prow of the<br />city and plummet, and now…
9514859 9518446 It could never happen in real<br />life, because the distance between
9518613 9521282 where the tomb is and<br />where the prow is, is so far.
9521449 9523450 He'd have to be running<br />about a mile to get there.
9523534 9524785 Poetic license.
9525119 9527519 Because I just liked the<br />image of him plummeting.
9532084 9534566 It was very hard from a stunt point of
9534608 9537465 view to actually shoot<br />really good fighting
9537632 9541302 between horsemen and Orcs,<br />because it's just half the horses
9541469 9544972 shy away, and… You know, from<br />actually getting close to people,
9545139 9548225 and once you are waving<br />spears and swords around
9548392 9551562 it's just… It was always just…<br />The thing we had to do was just cutting it
9551646 9555316 very sharp and tight.<br />Because none of the actual fighting
9555483 9560529 we filmed was really that great.<br />We just had to fake it a wee bit.
9565326 9568370 Yeah, this was the scene that I<br />was really looking forward to doing.
9568454 9571957 I got to admit that if there was<br />one visual-effects sequence
9572124 9575824 in the entire <i>Lord of the Rings</i><br />that I'd been waiting to do for years,
9575961 9578547 and years and years, it was the mûmakil.<br />It was this scene.
9578631 9580465 Because I…<br />You know, right at the beginning
9580549 9582259 when we first came up with the idea
9582343 9585930 of doing <i>Lord of the Rings,</i><br />I just was waiting to do this.
9586097 9588724 And I had to wait till the<br />very end, because we didn't…
9588808 9592758 We didn't really put this scene together<br />properly until the beginning of 2003
9592895 9595189 when we were in our post-production.
9596023 9599527 I wanted the tusks of the mûmakil<br />to be more than just sort of tusks.
9599694 9603030 I wanted them to have big,<br />like, maces swinging off chains,
9603322 9606783 and to be… You know, to have all sorts<br />of supplementary weapons on their tusks
9606867 9610955 like big iron spikes that they've<br />sort of put on there as well.
9617920 9622049 …and… And in one of the earlier<br />versions there were so many shots…
9622216 9626178 …of mûmakil taking arrows, that<br />audience sympathy was really with them.
9626345 9628801 I mean, you were<br />really hating the Rohirrim
9628843 9631225 for wounding these animals. You really…
9631392 9634770 Well, when they would rear up, and<br />they would wave their paws around…
9634854 9636604 And there was just this sense of…
9638107 9641457 -Paws? Mûmakil don't have paws.<br />-No, I know… I know what you mean.
9642737 9644404 There were a few shots that made it look
9644488 9646588 like the mûmakil were really distressed.
9646741 9648700 And they were like circus…<br />Circus elephants.
9648784 9650285 I think it's because we're used to…
9650369 9652747 We're sort of programmed to be
9652913 9656083 a bit disgusted by the way<br />circus elephants are abused,
9656250 9659336 and they're whipped and they're made<br />to perform these silly tricks and things.
9659420 9662548 And it was feeling a bit<br />like a trained circus elephant
9662715 9665926 in some form of distress, wasn't it?<br />It was just… It was like…
9666010 9669710 It was pressing those buttons. It was<br />making you feel a bit sorry for them.
9673267 9674894 …which was horrible.
9675060 9677210 But that… That one didn't survive either.
9681108 9683808 …in order to try to swing<br />the sympathy the other way.
9685404 9688282 …because when you removed<br />those shots, it was fine.
9688449 9689949 I thought Shane was fantastic.
9690075 9691575 -The driver.<br />-Yeah, the driver.
9693788 9695956 …and he's been doing stunts<br />with us since the very beginning.
9696040 9699626 This was just about the only time you<br />see him actually without an Orc mask on.
9699710 9701044 He's usually an Uruk-hai or an Orc.
9701128 9703672 But he has such a great<br />presence to play the driver,
9703756 9706884 and we thought Shane's<br />actually got the perfect face.
9709053 9711361 Oh, that's a great<br />pileup, isn't it, that one?
9711403 9711703 Yeah.
9712431 9714057 …or Miranda's stunt double on a horse…
9714141 9716977 …and we put all the<br />battle action in afterwards.
9717144 9719062 We shot a lot of elements<br />of background horses
9719146 9721857 galloping left and right, and<br />we were able to take those,
9721941 9724818 and put them into all sorts of different<br />shots and build the battlefield up
9724902 9727529 add a lot of CG horses and<br />make it seem a lot busier.
9727613 9730907 If you look at these original plates in<br />the documentary on the green screen
9730991 9734703 that they're so much less spectacular<br />than what you're seeing here. It's…
9734787 9737622 It's amazing what you can do.<br />I just get excited by this stuff
9737706 9740918 because it opens up so many<br />possibilities for filmmakers
9741085 9743462 you know, that anything is possible now.
9744088 9746173 Once the mûmakil hits the ground here
9746340 9749635 it becomes a huge polystyrene<br />model that Richard Taylor made.
9749802 9753806 Which I think, if you ask Richard, is<br />probably about his proudest creation
9753973 9756558 in the entire experience of<br />doing <i>Lord of the Rings,</i> was the
9756642 9760354 full-sized mûmakil, which he<br />made for principal photography.
9760521 9762272 And we put it up in Queen Elizabeth Park.
9762356 9765025 And it's enormous, and then we…
9765192 9767444 There was talk about destroying it, and I…<br />And I said to them:
9767528 9770280 "Oh, I think we should just store it."<br />And they said, "Store it for what?"
9770364 9772324 You know, "We finished it, we filmed it."<br />And I said:
9772408 9774785 "Oh, you never know if we're<br />going to need it again." And then
9774869 9776953 sure enough, we dragged it<br />out, and we put it on our field
9777037 9779748 in the parking lot at Stone<br />Street for doing pickups.
9779832 9782793 And we did a lot of pickups with that…<br />With that mûmakil lying there
9782877 9784211 -didn't we?<br />-Yeah.
9784378 9788382 The entire Witch-king fight was shot there<br />and all the stuff with Éowyn fighting.
9788549 9791749 And now we've kept it, because they said…<br />After that they said:
9791886 9794304 "Oh, we should destroy it now,<br />shouldn't we?" And I said, "No, no, no.
9794388 9796588 I might want to put it<br />in my garden one day."
9798392 9800644 …as opposed to painting it in later?
9805149 9808527 …and it… It avoids having<br />to edit every single shot.
9808694 9810821 And it's also something<br />that people can jump around.
9810905 9814783 They can move around it. It becomes…<br />It becomes just part of a set.
9814950 9818328 You know, otherwise, you may as<br />well create everything on a computer.
9818412 9821412 You know, but you don't.<br />You build… You still build rooms
9822082 9824042 you still build pieces of<br />set for things to happen,
9824126 9826420 and it just became part of the set.
9835137 9838137 Now, this is an important scene<br />that was written as a pickup.
9841644 9844896 It's right at the end of <i>The Return<br />of the King</i> when Tolkien describes
9844980 9848567 what Frodo sees when<br />he's on the boat sailing out.
9848734 9852112 I always was very moved by it,<br />that it was completely pertinent
9852279 9855579 to have it in the story, not…<br />Not to have it just at the end
9855741 9857868 to give it a value to the characters
9858035 9861205 as the story was unfolding and<br />things were increasingly grim.
9861372 9864124 And this scene tells you<br />about Frodo's destiny.
9864541 9867544 So it has a… Has a good<br />function in terms of the storytelling.
9867628 9869421 Because when… When Frodo does leave
9869505 9871381 you have a sense of where…<br />To where he's going.
9871465 9873884 It's also quite nice to get<br />some relief from the battle,
9873968 9878681 and break away from the fighting<br />and come to look at the other side of it.
9881475 9884525 …at the beginning of the year,<br />before we shot any pickups…
9884770 9886897 …there was a sense that you last saw…
9887064 9890985 …Gandalf and Pippin saving<br />Faramir from the funeral pyre…
9891443 9893737 …and then you had this whole<br />sequence where the Rohirrim arrive…
9893821 9896281 …they basically do what they're doing.<br />Aragorn arrives…
9896365 9899159 …with the Army of the<br />Dead, and yet there's no…
9899326 9903079 There's… There's no reactions of<br />Gandalf or Pippin. They sort of disappear.
9903163 9905790 Somehow we wanted to see something<br />of their reaction to what was happening.
9905874 9907918 But…<br />But this is great, because it's not just…
9908002 9910902 It's not a literal reaction to<br />the events outside the city.
9912506 9915926 It's actually a continuation of what<br />they're experiencing within the city.
9916010 9917511 It's their darkest hour.
9922850 9924559 Pippin changes at the end of the scene.
9924643 9926562 Yeah.
9934445 9938198 And she would literally shoot these<br />takes until she could not stand up anymore
9938282 9940617 because she's not strong.<br />I mean, she was fit,
9940701 9942035 and she was great with the sword,
9942119 9944120 but she's obviously<br />not a tough stunt person.
9944204 9947541 And so we had these long fight routines.<br />And she would literally
9947708 9949793 get towards the end and collapse.<br />You could almost see
9949877 9953756 Miranda's batteries winding down<br />as her energy was sapping away
9953922 9955465 swinging and swinging and swinging.
9955549 9957634 And she ended up in tears<br />at the end of some of it.
9957718 9962723 She was just fighting so intensely<br />that she would bring herself to tears.
9962890 9965684 And we'd… And, you know, we'd<br />stop and we'd reset and she'd go again.
9965768 9968020 And she was just really brave.
9972107 9974526 She looked like she had<br />been beaten to a pulp.
9977237 9978843 …with the Witch-king in his old helmet,
9978885 9980573 back in the days of<br />principal photography.
9980657 9983327 And we made that decision<br />to redesign the helmet,
9983494 9986162 and that meant that we had<br />to basically reshoot the fight.
9986246 9989124 And we also changed the weapon too.<br />Because we…
9989291 9991591 We felt that the fight<br />wasn't that interesting.
9996423 9999009 …because they knew you'd like it bigger.<br />And then when you saw it…
9999093 10001143 …you wanted it 50 percent bigger again.
10003430 10006517 It looked like it could just<br />take off her head with one hit.
10006934 10010771 A lot of this stuff was just swinging<br />with a stick. He was holding a stick,
10010938 10014138 and the chain and the mace was<br />added in the computer later on.
10015567 10017444 It was always difficult to imagine the…<br />The…
10017528 10019696 The relationship between the<br />river and the docks and the city.
10019780 10021823 It was just one of those things<br />that you don't really think about.
10021907 10024242 But obviously it became<br />important to us to have to…
10024326 10026537 -To stage this stuff.<br />-Yeah.
10030874 10032584 -Joel Tolbeck plays him.<br />-Yes.
10032751 10035045 We…<br />We used to nickname him George, didn't we?
10035129 10038629 And we used to imagine that that<br />was possibly his mother's skull on it.
10044263 10046063 -She went everywhere with him.<br />-Yeah.
10052813 10054773 That's one of the weird things<br />with these extended cuts, isn't it?
10054857 10057901 You sometimes wonder whether<br />you're taking a backwards step.
10060529 10062906 Well, we have. We've seen<br />almost the same image, which is why
10062990 10064574 -we took it out of the theatrical version.<br />-Yeah.
10064658 10066660 -We just saved it for here.<br />-Yeah.
10072291 10074141 Meanwhile, back on Pelennor Fields…
10077880 10080630 This is a lot of people's<br />favorite moment in the book,
10080757 10083886 and a lot of people's<br />favorite moment in the movie.
10089683 10091685 She did. This gets a huge cheer.
10098775 10101361 Sometimes when you see a movie<br />for the first time with an audience
10101445 10104656 you really just don't know what's<br />going to happen at certain moments.
10104740 10106491 And we were always<br />worried that we didn't think
10106575 10108576 this was necessarily as<br />powerful as it should be.
10108660 10110910 But the cheering that<br />I heard in the cinema
10111038 10113665 it makes you feel good, and<br />you think, "Oh, okay, it works."
10113749 10115334 There's a huge sense of relief.
10117836 10120923 Viggo, in this fight scene here, it's…<br />The moment's passed,
10121089 10122966 but the first Orc that Viggo kills
10123050 10124884 -is actually his son. Henry.<br />-Henry.
10124968 10127304 But Henry played a<br />young boy at Helm's Deep
10127471 10128821 three or four years ago.
10128972 10132016 And… And here in pickups he was this…<br />He came back to New Zealand,
10132100 10133476 and he was, like, this young man.
10133560 10135103 -He's taller than his dad, isn't he?<br />-Yeah.
10135187 10137731 And so Viggo wanted<br />to use him in the movie.
10137898 10139650 And we stuck him in an Orc suit,
10139816 10142819 and he was actually part of the stunt<br />team. And he was… He took the first…
10142903 10145906 He was the first Orc that<br />Aragorn kills on Pelennor Fields.
10147407 10150076 This is a sequence that we obviously<br />didn't use in the theatrical cut,
10150160 10152245 but it was really just<br />to finish Gothmog off
10152329 10154038 that we felt we had<br />established this character,
10154122 10156791 and we wanted to give him a<br />death, and make it meaningful
10156875 10159878 to, you know, Éowyn, who<br />Gothmog has been attacking.
10162047 10164997 -We wanted Aragorn to save someone.<br />-And I like the irony…
10166385 10169930 He doesn't know, obviously,<br />that Éowyn is part of the battle.
10170389 10175477 Now, this was a scene that was<br />created just because of the fact
10175644 10179022 that Legolas' stunts in<br /><i>Fellowship</i> and <i>Two Towers</i>
10179189 10180940 had gone down so well with audiences.
10181024 10183985 And we actually didn't have<br />anything in <i>Return of the King</i> for him.
10184069 10187447 You know, we had had the<br />skateboarding down the Helm's Deep steps,
10187614 10190533 and the jumping on the horse and<br />the cave-troll stuff in <i>Fellowship.</i> And…
10190617 10192995 And we didn't have anything for…<br />For Legolas.
10193161 10196373 So seeing how well the<br />other scenes played, I…
10196540 10199500 I thought, "Okay, well, we've gotta<br />design something for him to do."
10199584 10201484 And the only thing I could think of
10201628 10204714 in terms of where he is in the story<br />was to give him something with a mûmakil.
10204798 10207759 And so we invented this whole sequence.
10207926 10211221 The Weta animation department<br />actually did a sort of animatic for me
10211305 10213640 before Orlando arrived in New<br />Zealand of what he could do.
10213724 10216893 So I was able to show Orlando,<br />because most of it's a computer Orlando.
10216977 10219127 There's obviously a few shots of the real
10219604 10221604 -Orly who we shot…<br />-That's real Orly.
10221732 10224484 And we shot this whole<br />sequence with Orly in one day.
10224651 10226820 We only had a day
10227237 10229989 because he was only in New Zealand…<br />He was shooting <i>Ned Kelly</i> in Australia
10230073 10232408 I think it was, wasn't it?<br />Or was he about to head off…
10232492 10234369 -Don't know.<br />-…to <i>Troy</i> or something? I can't…
10234453 10235829 -I can't remember.<br />-Yeah.
10235996 10238498 And he was only able to<br />be with us for three days,
10238582 10241626 and so we did the dri…<br />We did the drinking competition on one day
10241710 10243503 we did something else<br />another day, and we had one day
10243587 10245987 to shoot all of this<br />entire sequence with him.
10246673 10249593 Which we… Which we did<br />by planning it very carefully.
10261021 10264191 And this… This shot we did<br />deliberately to try to actually
10264358 10267361 explain the sort of<br />dynamics that the ghosts
10267527 10269654 are moving through. Killing all the Orcs.
10269738 10272699 Because you end up with a situation<br />where you've got so many Orcs everywhere
10272783 10275118 all the way through the city,<br />right the way to the very top
10275202 10279122 that we just had to somehow explain<br />why they suddenly all disappeared.
10279289 10283543 And the fact that the ghosts had<br />gone through and dealt with them all.
10288090 10291885 And this is a sequence that Fran<br />directed pretty much, didn't you?
10292052 10293887 I love this scene.
10294054 10296598 In fact, you re-shot it. We shot it once
10296765 10300519 in the principal photog…<br />Photography out at Queen Elizabeth Park.
10300685 10304064 And then we shot it again<br />with revised dialogue, didn't we?
10307234 10310320 Particularly it ended, actually, as it<br />does in the book, with him saying:
10310404 10313448 "I wish I could have<br />seen Éomer one last time."
10313615 10315450 And we felt that was<br />sort of wrong, didn't we?
10315534 10317484 -We had to redo it.<br />-Yes, that was, yes.
10317577 10319538 But it was also
10319704 10323500 which I really like, which<br />was the take Fran had on it
10323667 10325043 which is that
10325210 10328922 in the very first go-round<br />she was a lot more weepy
10329089 10330632 a lot more distraught.
10330799 10332717 But this feels a lot more real.
10337681 10339974 …of <i>Return of the King,</i> and<br />we gave him his farewell.
10340058 10344229 You know, we presented him a sword,<br />and we gave him a big speech and a party.
10344396 10348191 And then we decided that we wanted<br />to reshoot this after he had already left.
10348275 10351069 But fortunately he was on<br />holiday down in the South Island,
10351153 10353154 and hadn't actually left New Zealand yet.
10353238 10355866 And so we called him<br />up and said, "Look, we…
10356032 10358117 We gave you a farewell<br />party the other day,
10358201 10360870 but would you mind coming back<br />for just one more day of shooting?
10360954 10364082 Because we just would<br />like to do this extra scene."
10367294 10369921 We knew that they were both<br />up for it, and they… They really…
10370005 10373805 That's why you went there, which I<br />thought was such a cool thing to do, Pete.
10375260 10379139 It's his last scene that he<br />ever shot for <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>
10382434 10384685 It was really about the<br />bravery of her character,
10384769 10389900 and that… That she only cries after<br />he's gone. She wouldn't do that…
10390066 10392166 -Yeah.<br />-…you know, as… As he was dying.
10392611 10394488 So it didn't feel right. That we…
10394654 10397365 The earlier scene we had shot, she<br />was quite tearful all the way through.
10397449 10399999 And in a way, it sort of<br />wore itself out, didn't it?
10403997 10405582 That's what she tried to do.
10405749 10407667 -She tried to save him.<br />-Yes.
10419971 10424100 This scene was partially<br />written as a way of justifying
10424518 10427103 the obvious question. I mean, if I<br />was an audience member watching this
10427187 10430231 I'd be saying, "Well, they gotta<br />go in and take Mordor, right"
10430315 10432442 because they haven't killed Sauron.<br />So why don't they just keep
10432526 10434527 all these ghosts with them,<br />because the ghosts can't be killed.
10434611 10436654 And they can go and they can<br />beat any bad guy in the world
10436738 10438781 "if they've got this ghost army.<br />It's invincible."
10438865 10441033 And so we had to actually<br />get rid of the ghosts,
10441117 10444454 and we had to have Gimli<br />ask the audience question:
10444621 10446747 "Well, hang on, Aragorn, I<br />think these guys are pretty useful.
10446831 10448499 -Why don't we just hang on to them?"<br />-Yeah.
10448583 10452546 And Aragorn has made a vow<br />to release them if they help him.
10452712 10454297 And then the king is such a bastard.
10454381 10456883 The King of the Dead<br />is such a difficult guy
10457050 10458968 he doesn't want to do<br />anything for a noble reason
10459052 10460220 he just wants to…
10460428 10463181 Aragorn to fulfill his vow, and<br />he sort of puts it on Aragorn
10463265 10465016 to actually do the honorable<br />thing, which Aragorn…
10465100 10466476 -And he does.<br />-…promised he would.
10466560 10470355 And he… And he does. So we…<br />We wrote this as a way of justifying
10470522 10473822 what we thought was a tricky<br />little kind of story logic problem.
10475819 10478196 …flying Frodo and the Ring to Mount Doom.
10479573 10480698 -Yeah, Middle-earth taxi.<br />-Yeah.
10480782 10482993 As many people have said.
10484911 10487622 …they would have been taken<br />out by the Nazgûl, the eagles.
10487706 10490206 -They couldn't have done it.<br />-When Frodo decided…
10493336 10494795 Why they didn't just summon up
10494879 10497729 Gwaihir the eagle and fly to<br />Mount Doom and drop it in.
10500302 10501761 Yeah, I know, I thought… I knew that.
10501845 10504139 -You knew that?<br />-I knew that.
10515984 10518141 Which, again, was<br />only taken out purely for
10518183 10520280 pacing reasons, that we just felt that…
10520447 10522615 We were sort of panicking<br />a wee bit, I guess, not…
10522699 10524867 Not really knowing how<br />the film was going to play.
10524951 10527787 And we just wanted to<br />push forward to the climax
10527954 10531004 of the movie on Mount Doom<br />as quickly as we possibly could.
10533627 10536087 -…was emotionally drain you so that…<br />-Yeah, that's true.
10536171 10538021 But by the time you got to the end
10538131 10541593 you kind of were all<br />emotioned out, weren't you?
10541760 10545010 And the weight of the front of<br />the movie started to crush the end.
10549184 10552103 -And this is like the second night.<br />-Yeah.
10553813 10555482 It's Liv's song.
10558360 10560760 -And the singing by Liv.<br />-And the singing by Liv.
10563281 10564615 -…to images of herself.<br />-Yes.
10564699 10566326 -Yeah.<br />-I like it because
10566493 10569043 if you want to see it…<br />Arwen singing to Éowyn
10569162 10574459 that it's a shared understanding of<br />how painful it can be to love someone.
10578630 10581424 She's hitting notes there<br />that are really, really difficult.
10581508 10583134 She's got a beautiful voice, Liv.
10583218 10588682 And that was one of the things we wanted<br />to do, was to… Was to hear her sing.
10600151 10603195 And then in the Extended Cut<br />we've got exactly the same scene.
10603279 10605323 It hasn't changed, but it's now nighttime
10605407 10607307 which is what you can do with film.
10607409 10609410 You can fiddle with little<br />buttons, turn the knobs,
10609494 10611615 and either… Either make it day or night
10611657 10613873 now with computer-controlled<br />color timing.
10614040 10616459 It's sort of…<br />It's a bit less important to know
10616543 10620193 what time of the day it is when<br />you're actually shooting it originally.
10622048 10623348 -During the cutting.<br />-Yeah.
10628054 10631224 …was in or out, as to what time of the…<br />Of the day it was.
10631391 10634644 It works better as a nighttime scene.<br />Because it's much more poignant.
10634728 10637438 You can imagine that Pippin has<br />been searching for hours for Merry.
10637522 10639273 He knows he's there,<br />and he just can't find him
10639357 10641233 because there's thousands<br />of bodies on the battlefield.
10641317 10643967 -So it has that poignancy, which is nice.<br />-And this…
10647157 10648407 This is the moment where we see
10648491 10650577 -that Pippin has grown up.<br />-Yeah.
10654873 10658084 I was always fascinated by the<br />way that Tolkien would describe these
10658168 10661170 particular structures as…<br />As having been built by the Númenóreans.
10661254 10663923 You know, they were good-guy towers.
10664090 10667635 Both Minas Morgul and Cirith Ungol were…<br />Were forts…
10667802 10671097 Fortresses that were built by the…<br />The Gondorians
10671264 10674517 essentially, in the old days, and<br />they had been taken over by the Orcs.
10674601 10676352 So I always liked the idea.
10676519 10679272 It gave us a lot of fun with<br />the design of the places
10679439 10682567 to make it seem like they<br />had been occupied by Orcs
10682734 10685779 who have put some of<br />their own architectural
10685945 10688319 style into the buildings,<br />whacking on bits
10688361 10690950 of iron and rusty spikes<br />on all the parapets.
10699459 10700794 -Is it?<br />-Yeah.
10705298 10707548 -Does his wig really fall off?<br />-Yeah, it does.
10708635 10709802 -Whereabouts? Let's just watch.<br />-There.
10709886 10712388 -Is it?<br />-Yes, it's in that toss across.
10712555 10713640 -Oh, is it?<br />-Yeah.
10717310 10719360 …and go back and check it out right now.
10720438 10722898 The fight scene here.<br />We've extended this a little… Little bit.
10722982 10725332 This was trimmed down<br />in the theatrical version.
10725485 10728935 Because it is… It's gratuitous,<br />and it's kind of a little bit silly.
10729489 10731073 -How can you say that?<br />-Probably more than
10731157 10733492 a little bit silly, but I…<br />I always quite liked it.
10733576 10735578 We had a lot of fun shooting it.<br />Just these guys
10735662 10737037 bashing the hell out of each other.
10737121 10740416 So I put a little bit more of it<br />back in the extended version.
10743878 10745129 Which is… It's a little bit silly
10745213 10746338 -in the book as well.<br />-Yeah.
10746422 10750022 It's slightly unbelievable, and it's<br />very convenient, because it means
10750176 10753846 that all the baddies are dead by the<br />time Sam has to go in and find Frodo.
10753930 10756265 Otherwise… It was almost<br />like Tolkien figuring out a way of
10756349 10759769 how… How on earth do I get Sam<br />into the tower? And he had to invent
10759853 10762188 a rationale.<br />Which would create the place…
10762355 10764555 -You know, mean the place was empty.<br />-He did.
10764649 10767443 The problem with a scene like this<br />is that once you have your bad guys
10767527 10771113 beating the hell out of each other,<br />they stop becoming a potent force.
10771197 10773347 -Well, they never win.<br />-They don't ever win.
10774367 10775917 -Yeah.<br />-They never hit anything.
10776077 10778913 Thousands of them get killed, and they…<br />They're sort of threatening,
10778997 10781332 but they never actually<br />deliver the goods.
10782876 10788047 We did have a… A bit with Sam<br />going past the Watchers too.
10788214 10791592 The Watchers are those statues at the<br />Gate who are meant as sort of a weird
10791676 10795972 kind of a psychic barrier<br />that he has to break through.
10796848 10799058 Which I thought about putting in the…<br />The Extended Cut.
10799142 10802311 And I ultimately didn't, because it<br />does slow the pace down a wee bit.
10802395 10806065 But maybe one day for the<br />25th anniversary edition we can…
10806232 10808882 We can put that in.<br />We'll keep that one up our sleeve.
10810111 10812488 I've always quite liked this moment.<br />It's another slightly silly…
10812572 10814615 There's a bit of silliness<br />around Cirith Ungol,
10814699 10818494 but, you know, these guys thinking<br />that some huge, big muscular superhero
10818578 10821330 is coming up the stairs, and then<br />they found out that it's just little Sam.
10821414 10822873 This was just about the only time that…
10822957 10825709 That Sean ever got to actually<br />do any fighting with his sword.
10825793 10829672 You know, he… He was in three<br />movies, and he did sword training,
10829839 10832592 and he was so into<br />wanting to be the hero.
10832759 10835553 And, like, this…<br />This little fight was about it,
10836054 10839014 and most of it was done by<br />Kiran, the little scale double.
10839098 10842948 I mean, Sean got to do… Swing a sword<br />around about three times in close-ups.
10846147 10849233 The mithril vest shot is another little<br />addition that we did, because obviously
10849317 10852820 we were adding in a subplot that<br />we took out of the theatrical version
10852904 10855948 which is about the mithril vest.<br />It pays off with the Mouth of Sauron
10856032 10858450 who is a character you'll<br />see coming up shortly.
10858534 10861996 Cirith Ungol was a miniature about<br />12 foot tall. I really like the miniature.
10862080 10864456 We've… We've hung on to that one,<br />because it's a beautiful big model.
10864540 10867001 Just have to build a big<br />enough room to put it in.
10873466 10877053 Steven Ure is… is a really great Orc.<br />He was one of our favorite Orcs.
10877220 10882433 And as I said earlier, he sort of<br />appeared as several Orcs over the trilogy.
10885603 10887313 He's from Orc-land.
10891442 10893319 …almost two years before<br />the film was gonna come out.
10893403 10896697 And <i>Empire</i> magazine had just put<br />a picture of Frodo on the front cover,
10896781 10898407 and it was the first<br />time <i>Lord of the Rings</i>
10898491 10900409 had ever had a cover<br />photo on any magazine.
10900493 10903787 This was the day we were shooting<br />this scene, and everyone crowded around.
10903871 10906999 And we were so excited that…<br />That there was an image from the movie
10907083 10908834 that we were still in<br />the middle of shooting.
10908918 10911754 It was… Had actually started<br />to pop up on a magazine cover.
10911838 10913839 It was sort of a really, kind of…<br />Those things
10913923 10916926 give you a bit of a morale boost,<br />especially when you're a year into
10917010 10919137 shooting a difficult movie.
10919887 10923057 In the book, Sam puts the<br />Ring on, doesn't he, at one stage
10923224 10926060 just prior… Earlier than this.<br />Which was something we avoided, that…
10926144 10928521 -Didn't we, in the script?<br />-Yeah. It was…
10931858 10934109 The thought was very late in coming to us
10934193 10937071 on how to shape this scene, wasn't it?<br />And in the end, we…
10937155 10939282 It was a bit of a salvage in ADR.
10939449 10944620 But we…<br />At this stage, we were playing Frodo the…
10944787 10950168 First off, we were playing Frodo's<br />relief and in… And… And intense need
10950334 10952754 almost a junkie's need,<br />to get the Ring back.
10952920 10956382 But we pulled back on that<br />because we also realized this scene
10956549 10960428 needed to show, actually, the opposite.<br />It needed to show
10960595 10964182 that Sam could so easily<br />and so quickly go there.
10964348 10966809 And that by taking it back,<br />Frodo was helping him.
10969687 10972314 …he was actually doing it to<br />save Sam and to help Sam.
10972398 10974108 -We'd seen the junkie…<br />-So it gave Frodo
10974192 10975943 a heroic kind of moment.
10976110 10978570 And that was only done with<br />the way that we cut it together.
10978654 10980280 -Like, it wasn't shot that way.<br />-No.
10980364 10983576 But we just kept cutting back<br />to more shots of Sam waiting
10983743 10985327 which were from all different takes.
10985411 10987830 Because he… He wasn't waiting<br />for so long in the original take,
10987914 10991458 but we took a… A bit of waiting from<br />take two, a bit of waiting from take three
10991542 10994169 a bit of waiting from take<br />four, stitched them all together,
10994253 10996422 so that we…<br />We were able to create this feeling
10996506 10998132 that he wasn't handing the Ring over.
10998216 11000509 Because in the original<br />performance, he just… He just says:
11000593 11002344 "Give me the Ring," and<br />Sam just hands it to him.
11002428 11004828 It was like there was<br />no tension at all in there.
11008768 11010436 There was… And… And the hesitation<br />was actually concern at Frodo's state
11010520 11013272 not actually his own<br />desire to keep the Ring
11013439 11015607 which actually you've managed<br />to construct really well there,
11015691 11017318 so it was a good save.
11017485 11019987 Because, originally, I think we…
11020154 11022657 It was one of those<br />things where we actually
11022824 11027120 realized we'd played the junkie beat<br />through in… In <i>Two Towers,</i> hadn't we?
11027286 11030915 By the time we got to <i>The Two<br />Towers</i> pickups, we'd… We'd done that.
11031082 11034418 And at this stage, Frodo's fully<br />aware of the evil of the Ring,
11034585 11037463 and he also knows it's gonna kill Sam.
11041509 11043636 …because he turned away from Sam…
11043803 11045638 -…when he should not have.<br />-Yeah.
11045805 11050393 But has learned from that and knows<br />what Sam must now turn away from.
11054397 11055669 …and that's Frodo must carry that thing.
11055711 11057024 It's a… It's a redeeming moment for him.
11057108 11058067 -It is.<br />-Yeah.
11058151 11059401 I wish we'd had that thought, though
11059485 11061885 because I think we<br />could've written it better.
11062989 11064031 -Yeah.
11064198 11066898 -But… But we did okay in the end.<br />-We got through it.
11069412 11070913 -Yeah.<br />-This was the last day of shooting.
11070997 11075126 This was done in the morning on our<br />very last day of principal photography.
11077170 11079278 …was him putting on the coat, wasn't it?
11079320 11080920 Which I never put in the movie.
11083467 11085594 And it doesn't appear in<br />the Extended Cut either.
11085678 11088013 This sequence replaces<br />the one in the tent
11088097 11089807 because that was another<br />thing that was in the book
11089891 11093769 that didn't quite work, we felt, in<br />the film, is that we're establishing…
11093936 11097272 You know, we've spent so long with<br />Aragorn making his way to Minas Tirith
11097356 11099108 that in the book, of course,<br />he gets there, and he says:
11099192 11102742 "Well, I can't enter the city,<br />because I'm not king yet." is that right?
11107408 11109868 …and too difficult for<br />us to get into in the film.
11109952 11112580 So this…<br />This council of war happens in the book,
11112747 11115797 but it happens on a tent on<br />the remains of the battlefield.
11121964 11126010 …and the ride of the knights of Dol<br />Amroth is a great moment in the book…
11126177 11127979 …but we just could not bring a new
11128021 11130223 character in at this<br />moment into the story.
11132725 11136520 Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br />"I am Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth.
11136687 11138355 I've come to help you with my knights."
11138439 11140983 -What are you doing?<br />-I don't know.
11141150 11143100 -This is what we have to deal with.<br />-No.
11143194 11147031 "I am Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth."<br />He's got a great name.
11147198 11149783 It's a shame. Because that was one<br />of the cool things in the book, is that
11149867 11153120 a few people turn up from<br />different outlying counties
11153287 11155330 don't they, to come to Minas<br />Tirith to help in the battle,
11155414 11158542 and to bolster up the armies, and…<br />That was in one of our earlier scripts.
11158626 11161754 Prince Imrahil was in our<br />Miramax draft, if I remember rightly.
11161921 11164674 He… He was there for a while.<br />He made his appearance.
11165466 11166467 Yeah.
11166759 11169011 This was a scene that<br />we didn't use in the movie.
11169095 11171180 It's kind of cool. We just liked the idea
11171264 11174850 because, of course.<br />We were in our time-crunching mode
11175017 11178395 we thought it was a great cut to go<br />from Gimli saying his little line about:
11178479 11181523 "What are we waiting for?" Which was a…<br />A John Rhys-Davies ad-lib.
11181607 11183150 And then cut straight to Viggo
11183234 11185945 with the crown on his<br />chest marching out to war.
11186112 11190616 And that was just a real tempting jump<br />cut to make that pushed the movie along,
11190783 11194620 and got you really going. But this is<br />how we originally conceived the sequence
11194704 11197957 which was to be challenging Sauron.
11198124 11199583 Which is obviously… It's irrelevant.
11199667 11203796 It's more relevant to some degree<br />in the fact that when we shot this
11203963 11208301 we had already filmed Aragorn<br />and Sauron actually fighting outside
11208467 11211094 the Black Gate.<br />So this was the personal challenge
11211178 11213306 that was gonna bring Sauron to the Gate.
11213472 11216225 And it…<br />It still works in the context of the film
11216392 11217435 -because…<br />-Yep.
11217601 11219603 Because he's basically<br />challenging Sauron's armies
11219687 11221787 to come out to meet them, which is fine.
11225484 11227111 -And there's the dream.<br />-Yeah.
11228696 11230096 Yeah, so it's… It's there.
11231991 11234410 Different momentum to<br />this part of the film now.
11234577 11237496 And different motivation,<br />actually, for Sauron.
11254555 11256849 And it's good to have<br />this stuff back in too.
11257016 11261062 It's one of those difficult situations<br />where you're taking two characters,
11261228 11263689 and having them fall<br />in love very quickly.
11263856 11266942 And… And we did shoot these<br />scenes, but I guess we just decided
11267026 11268193 in the theatrical cut of…
11268277 11271113 Of, you know, we had to just stick<br />with our main central characters
11271197 11273949 which at this point in time,<br />were really Aragorn and his gang,
11274033 11279747 and Frodo and Sam. And we…<br />We had to just exclude other plot lines
11279914 11282958 because we felt we wanted to<br />concentrate and tighten up the climax.
11283042 11285961 But this is nice, and this does<br />certainly earn you the moment of them
11286045 11287845 being together at the coronation.
11292760 11294636 I think… I think it's really<br />great that Éowyn and Faramir
11294720 11297472 -who are two troubled characters…<br />-Pretty damaged.
11297556 11299016 -…get together. And that's great…<br />-Yeah.
11299100 11299975 -…and that's…<br />-Yeah.
11300059 11301768 You know, we never really<br />were able to celebrate that
11301852 11302978 -in the theatrical version…<br />-Yeah.
11303062 11304397 …but it's… It has a…
11304730 11305830 Its poignancy is here.
11309443 11311779 -He's kind of more fragile.<br />-Yeah.
11324917 11329296 Not that it's, you know, amazing, but I<br />just like… Love the idea of these Orcs,
11329463 11333259 and Frodo and Sam being caught out.
11333426 11336220 I love it in the book, and…
11336387 11337679 So I enjoyed shooting it,
11337763 11342685 and I was quite sad to actually<br />see it leave the theatrical version.
11342852 11346229 Again, it was just a pacing thing, but I<br />know that there was a lot of people that
11346313 11349775 I think, quite rightly, commented<br />in the reviews and things
11349942 11352361 that…<br />That Frodo and Sam sort of reach Mordor,
11352445 11355364 and appear to go quite unmolested
11355531 11358408 you know, towards the<br />volcano in the theatrical version.
11358492 11362537 So this does certainly make it seem a<br />lot harder for them to actually get there
11362621 11363622 which is great.
11368294 11371630 This was filmed on a<br />real volcano, Ruapehu
11371797 11374697 in the middle of the North<br />Island of New Zealand, and…
11374800 11375884 It was one of those great days.
11375968 11379221 We shot it over, I think, a couple<br />of days, and it was fun. We had…
11379305 11381223 The Orcs are the New Zealand army
11381390 11383601 -in these scenes.<br />-Yeah.
11383767 11385727 They're all soldiers<br />from a nearby army camp
11385811 11387729 because that… This area of New Zealand
11387813 11391525 is a very military…<br />Sort of is a training zone for the army,
11391692 11394236 so we were able to pull<br />in a bunch of soldiers and…
11394320 11395770 And put them in the Orc gear.
11402369 11405414 …in coming to us was the. "10,000<br />Orcs now lie between Frodo and Sam."
11405498 11408834 Remember? The emptying of<br />the land, giving it that physical thing
11408918 11412129 about why the Orcs were on the<br />move, tying it in to Frodo and Sam
11412213 11415173 suddenly stumbling across these<br />Orcs who are on their way to the front.
11415257 11417007 -We know exactly why they…<br />-Right.
11419887 11422264 …to try to draw the Orcs away from<br />Frodo and Sam. And here they are.
11422348 11423432 They're actually in the army
11423516 11424850 -marching towards Aragorn.<br />-I know. I know.
11424934 11428771 Which I kind of… I think is a…<br />Is a neat little twist.
11435361 11437530 This is one of my favorite prosthetics.
11437696 11442076 This guy here, who is…<br />A guy called Phil Grieve, who's played
11442243 11446038 another two or three Orcs for<br />us in other scenes in <i>Two Towers.</i>
11446205 11450459 He… He was… He was an Orc, and he…<br />This makeup just works so well.
11450626 11453837 It's like… Some prosthetic makeup<br />looks a bit silly and cheesy, and…
11453921 11457216 And other makeup just seems to fit.<br />And… And this one is great.
11457383 11461929 I love his white eye and<br />his eaten-away nose.
11462096 11465182 He's had, like, some…<br />Some moths or some insects
11465349 11467309 have had a bit of a nibble at his nose.
11467393 11469436 -Yuck.<br />-It's sort of rotted away.
11469603 11472273 This is potentially very confusing.
11472439 11475150 It was quite hard to sort of<br />edit this to try to make sense
11475234 11477361 because it was quite busy.
11477528 11479613 They… They escape in a different<br />way in the book, don't they?
11479697 11481031 Something to do with a bridge where they…
11481115 11482199 -Don't they end up hanging…<br />-Yeah.
11482283 11484284 -…under a bridge or something?<br />-Under a bridge, yeah.
11484368 11487413 The movie is so vividly<br />etched into your mind
11487580 11489831 I get to the point where I<br />can't remember the differences
11489915 11491416 between the book and the film.
11491500 11493960 Or I can't remember if<br />something was in the book,
11494044 11497172 or if it was an early idea for a…<br />For a scene that we dropped.
11497256 11499758 My memory is just so<br />muddy about all this stuff.
11499842 11501092 -I know.<br />-I haven't obviously picked up
11501176 11502928 the book and actually<br />read the book for years.
11503012 11504846 I read little bits and pieces of it
11504930 11507891 -during pickups.<br />-We were, like, continually reading it…
11507975 11511325 -But not reading it. You're reading it…<br />-But not reading it, yeah.
11512771 11513855 And then you're putting it down,
11513939 11515690 and you're reading a<br />completely different section,
11515774 11518944 and you… You lose the<br />experience of the book as a whole.
11519111 11522948 And I… Now my mind is so muddled<br />up as to what… Which is what.
11523115 11524575 I know.
11524742 11525992 This was a real location.
11526660 11528912 It was called the<br />boulder field, which is…
11529079 11532625 It's like a… A field of large rocks
11532791 11535293 that have been deposited<br />during some volcanic eruption,
11535377 11537421 or a lava flow or a mudflow.
11537588 11539381 And this is…<br />It's just quite amazing to be there.
11539465 11544428 It's this just endless sea of<br />boulders for miles and miles.
11547222 11549850 It was a great…<br />A great place to do Mordor.
11550017 11554480 Obviously the volcano<br />is not quite that shape.
11555731 11559151 This is more establishing<br />the difficulty for Frodo, and…
11562112 11564823 Much more of the effort to cross<br />the plains of Gorgoroth, wasn't it?
11564907 11567076 -Yeah, yeah.<br />-And the climb.
11570454 11572873 Most of it's here, and this… This little
11572915 11575668 scene leads up to them<br />throwing away the armor.
11575834 11578837 I wish we'd made a little bit more of<br />Sam throwing the pots and pans away
11578921 11581047 because it's such a<br />lovely moment in the book.
11581131 11584092 And we have it here, but it's…<br />It's not… I just wished…
11584176 11585760 -It is heartbreaking.<br />-It was one of those things
11585844 11586928 that was just done as a hurry.
11587012 11588513 -I remember when this was shot…<br />-Yeah.
11588597 11592685 …we were rushing to get scenes<br />finished, and we were behind schedule.
11592851 11595688 And it was…<br />We couldn't sort of dwell on it.
11595854 11599525 But it needed that extra close-up<br />of Sam just saying goodbye
11599692 11604321 to his trusty pots and pans, and we never…<br />We never had that.
11618794 11621421 …and I only found out when I<br />saw my name on the call sheet.
11621505 11623966 Peter had neglected to tell me.
11624925 11628220 And then I was horrified,<br />because I didn't know what to do.
11628387 11631557 We did shoot this scene twice.<br />We had another run at it,
11631724 11636645 but we shot this out on<br />the Ruapehu stony plain
11636812 11641692 with this big expansive ground at<br />the foot of one of our active volcanoes.
11641859 11643610 It's an extraordinary landscape.
11643777 11647906 It is not that high, I hasten to add.<br />That landscape is a model.
11655247 11659460 It's interesting, because, as far as<br />extras go, it's a very important fact
11659626 11662003 that if you're gonna have<br />people portraying the army
11662087 11664590 then the very best<br />people to use are the army.
11664757 11667676 And they do bring reality to<br />the fact that they're soldiers
11667760 11670471 which you wouldn't<br />get from normal extras.
11670637 11672514 This was shot the day<br />after we did the scene
11672598 11674808 in the beginning of <i>The Two<br />Towers</i> where they climb up,
11674892 11676518 and they talk about lembas bread.
11676602 11678645 And they sit down and take the<br />lembas bread out of their pack.
11678729 11680355 Then the next day we're<br />in the same location.
11680439 11682023 It was almost… It was about 10 feet away
11682107 11683983 from where we did that <i>Two Towers</i> scene
11684067 11685610 we did this bit for <i>Return of the King.</i>
11685694 11688029 That was the first time that the<br />guys had ever worn this makeup
11688113 11690615 with all the parched lips and<br />the cracked skin and things,
11690699 11693535 and I really… I really like it.
11693702 11696037 We had to… We had to replace<br />the sky in a lot of these scenes
11696121 11700166 because any… Any time we were shooting<br />Mordor, we had to have clouds in the sky
11700250 11702585 because of the big cloud.<br />And I remember a lot of the Mordor stuff
11702669 11704880 was in blue skies and sun.
11705297 11708926 So we had to have Weta<br />do a major sky replacement,
11709092 11712095 for a lot of the Mordor<br />scenes to get clouds there.
11712262 11716767 Which is sometimes not that easy, to pull<br />a matte off the edge of people's hair,
11716934 11719978 and replace the sky above them.<br />And especially if…
11720145 11721813 Because sometimes<br />the sky tends to burn out,
11721897 11725984 and you lose your edges around the<br />hairline, and it's a… Gets a bit tricky.
11729655 11733992 This was inspired by a scene in the<br />book of Frodo swatting invisible flies
11734159 11736911 walking along, which I<br />always remember that passage,
11736995 11739164 and wanted to portray it in the movie.
11739331 11743669 This particular scene is Sean Astin's last<br />scene that we ever shot of him as Sam.
11743836 11746713 It was his last day on<br /><i>Return of the King</i> pickups.
11746880 11750676 Finished the scene, and then we<br />had a party for him straight afterwards.
11752970 11754763 We did develop the Eyeball in this film.
11754847 11757390 It looks sort of the same.<br />But we actually had it moving around
11757474 11759684 which I don't think we did<br />in the earlier films, did we?
11759768 11761936 We… We realized in this one<br />that we had to have the Eye
11762020 11765148 actually physically<br />searching for Frodo and Sam.
11767109 11768459 -Yeah, it is. It is.<br />-It is.
11771530 11773156 And it's more powerful.
11775784 11777202 Yeah.
11780414 11784501 It's the only bit of wide, flat desert<br />land in New Zealand that we could find.
11784668 11789214 And it was in the… It was near Ruapehu<br />on the army munitions training ground.
11789381 11793844 And this particular landscape had<br />about 40 years of bombs dropped on it.
11794011 11796722 Hand grenades, mortars.<br />Bombs from aircraft.
11796889 11799307 And this was a sort of a no-go area.<br />It was an area that…
11799391 11802685 That nobody ever goes, because<br />there's so much unexploded ammo there.
11802769 11804729 And we said to the army,<br />"Listen, you've gotta help us.
11804813 11807816 This is the only place we can film.<br />We need a flat desert landscape,
11807900 11810652 and this is the only place in New<br />Zealand we can find this landscape."
11810736 11813988 The army guys sort of rolled their<br />heads, looking like, "Oh, my God."
11814072 11816533 And I think if it was up to<br />some of those junior officers
11816617 11817992 they would've told<br />us just to get stuffed.
11818076 11819661 But fortunately the<br />government said to them:
11819745 11821454 "Listen, you've gotta help<br />the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> people."
11821538 11824833 So the army had to go through<br />a bomb-disposal exercise.
11825000 11828587 They had to have their bomb-disposal<br />people clear decades' worth
11828754 11832341 of unexploded munitions.<br />They had to clear it from this huge area.
11832507 11834759 And on the day that we<br />arrived to do the shooting here
11834843 11838805 we had a big lecture from the army officer<br />who basically had it laid out on a table
11838889 11841391 about 10 different types of<br />bombs and hand grenades.
11841475 11843726 And said, "Listen, this<br />is what you might find.
11843810 11847438 If you see any one of these objects<br />lying on the ground, you are to stay still
11847522 11850900 put up your hand, and a bomb-disposal<br />person will come over straightaway."
11850984 11854070 And so we had bomb-disposal people<br />surrounding us while we were shooting
11854154 11857240 ready to jump in if…<br />If any one of us kicked something
11857407 11859909 with our toe and looked down and<br />found it was a bomb on the ground.
11859993 11862043 -Quite a tense time.<br />-But didn't they say:
11871254 11874383 So the Mouth of Sauron<br />is played by Bruce Spence.
11874549 11877260 Well, you'd certainly remember<br />him if you had seen <i>Mad Max 2</i>
11877344 11879012 which is <i>The Road<br />Warrior,</i> I think it's called.
11879096 11882683 And he plays the autogiro,<br />the little helicopter pilot.
11882849 11885143 And he's, along with Christopher Lee…<br />He's…
11885227 11886853 And Brad Dourif, he's the other actor
11886937 11890398 that actually was cut out completely<br />out of… Out of <i>Return of the King.</i>
11890482 11892532 So it was great to<br />have him back in again.
11892651 11895403 And he's described as the Mouth<br />of Sauron, and so I wanted Weta to…
11895487 11897990 To design a helmet that<br />just featured his mouth.
11899825 11902410 And so they did something<br />that deliberately sort of…
11902494 11904037 It just didn't feature eyes.
11904204 11906623 It was just… And the design of it was…
11906790 11911003 Everything was emphasizing the…<br />The… Where the mouth was.
11911169 11913319 And we shot Bruce and… And did the stuff,
11913463 11916063 and he had a little<br />prosthetic on around his lips.
11916216 11917300 And then when we were in post
11917384 11919469 I just felt that the Mouth of<br />Sauron wasn't distinctive enough,
11919553 11921429 and it wasn't sort of memorable enough.
11921513 11924307 And so what we ended up doing,<br />which I think worked really well,
11924391 11925767 and I… I'm really quite pleased with it
11925851 11930188 is we took Bruce Spence's<br />original prosthetic mouth,
11930355 11933608 and we simply cut it<br />out, and we enlarged it,
11933775 11935276 and we pasted it back on again.
11935360 11940615 So that the mouth that you're seeing<br />here is exactly what we shot at the time
11940782 11943618 except about 50 percent<br />bigger than his real mouth.
11943785 11945620 And it's a disturbing effect
11945787 11947413 because you don't quite<br />know what's wrong with it.
11947497 11951376 But it looks weird.<br />It looks sort of unnatural.
11959009 11961845 Another Aragorn beheading.<br />It was great to…
11962012 11965223 Heads getting chopped off tends<br />to pop up in these extended cuts.
11966224 11968574 Something I'm quite<br />grateful for, I have to say.
11970854 11974204 One of the main problems was<br />that all the characters are engaging
11975067 11977567 in the possible death<br />of Frodo at a time that
11977694 11980294 because the film is back<br />in chronological order
11980447 11982240 we know that Frodo's alive and well.
11982324 11984378 And so suddenly your characters are
11984420 11986995 playing things that<br />we are not buying into.
11987370 11990916 Because in the…<br />In the book, it's played in a way that you
11991083 11992750 the reader of the book,<br />could possibly think
11992834 11994002 that Frodo is dead at this stage.
11994086 11997214 You actually are believing what<br />the Mouth of Sauron's saying.
11997380 12000091 When we restructured the<br />film to be more chronological
12000175 12003975 it just didn't work anymore in that way.<br />We couldn't make it work anymore.
12007599 12010769 This was a very small studio<br />set surrounded by green screen.
12010936 12013271 The rocks were made<br />of a spongy sort of stuff.
12013438 12015148 They look like very sharp, jagged rocks.
12015232 12019361 It would've been dangerous to have<br />the actors falling on them and tumbling.
12019528 12024616 So we made the rocks out of a sponge,<br />and they were actually like soft rubber.
12026451 12028537 Galloping back over the minefield again.
12028703 12031873 It added a certain degree of tension<br />to the days we were shooting here.
12031957 12034667 And the army guys were looking<br />at how far away they were galloping,
12034751 12035835 and I think they were thinking:
12035919 12038129 "God, they're… They're going<br />into a bit that we haven't cleared."
12038213 12040214 Because they were going a<br />long way away, and I was…
12040298 12043176 I was getting a bit nervous about it.
12044553 12047764 Viggo did this speech really well.<br />He did it just as you see it.
12047931 12049641 He did about six or seven takes.
12049808 12052435 He was shouting so much,<br />his voice was getting hoarser,
12052519 12055647 and hoarser as the… The takes were…<br />Were going through.
12058108 12060758 -Is that a word, "hoarser"?<br />-Well, it is… It is now.
12062445 12065573 And that's… Again, that's the New<br />Zealand army that he's addressing.
12065657 12067658 And it was good.<br />It was a real sort of military moment
12067742 12069744 because Viggo was<br />throwing himself into it,
12069828 12072330 and the soldiers were responding<br />really well and appropriately.
12072414 12074707 It's the sort of thing that I<br />guess soldiers expect to hear
12074791 12077891 from some general, don't they?<br />When they're… When they're…
12083341 12084175 -Well, you don't know.<br />-No, we don't know.
12084259 12085927 -Hey, Gallipoli.<br />-Gallipoli.
12103486 12106114 …but it was so dangerous<br />that Sean and Elijah…
12106281 12109784 …actually had safety wires on them when<br />they were climbing up that… That bank.
12109868 12112495 It was a lot steeper than<br />it ended up looking on film,
12112579 12113955 and we had to paint the wires out
12114039 12116541 because you can see<br />them trailing on behind them.
12116625 12119461 And it was on the side of a real volcano.
12122214 12123923 This is, I think… This is…<br />This is my favorite bit
12124007 12125967 -of Howard Shore music.<br />-Yeah.
12126134 12128184 -It's beautiful.<br />-The flute that he plays.
12128345 12131722 I think this is probably, if I had to<br />name my favorite track of music…
12131806 12134756 -Is it the whistle?<br />-Yeah, the whistle, rather. The whistle.
12134851 12137395 -It's beautiful.<br />-Oh, he's a genius.
12137562 12139564 And I remember shooting this stuff.<br />Remember this day?
12139648 12141649 -It was on the side of the volcano.<br />-Yeah.
12141733 12144486 And we had big lights,<br />and these are all real rocks,
12144653 12145987 and this stuff isn't rubber.
12146071 12150242 They were clamoring up, and it was…<br />It was quite a steep slope.
12150408 12155205 And yeah, it was kind<br />of dramatic stuff to film.
12161419 12162962 -I did. I gave it up for a year.<br />-We had to stop writing
12163046 12164839 -to go to the…<br />-I had to get the patches.
12164923 12166823 The pharmacy, to get you some patches.
12168009 12170804 Oh, God. That means you are.
12171096 12174641 This stuff was an amalgam of original<br />footage and some pickups we did.
12174808 12177685 We shot, like, this little exchange<br />between Legolas and Gimli
12177769 12179312 during pickups separately
12179396 12181063 because they weren't in<br />the country at the same time.
12181147 12183816 We shot Orlando first and<br />then John Rhys-Davies later
12183900 12188100 because we wanted to introduce a little<br />bit more character stuff into this climax.
12190156 12193006 And also wrapping up their<br />little story that was in there.
12193159 12194452 That was really sweet.
12198748 12200125 This was shot in a hurry.
12200292 12204254 It was done on the edge of a volcano,<br />and it was done at the late afternoon.
12204421 12207048 It was the… It was the same day<br />that we'd shot all the crawling-up stuff.
12207132 12209717 And it was one of those situations<br />where I hadn't planned the day too well
12209801 12213179 because I had spent, like, three-quarters<br />of the day shooting them crawling
12213263 12214722 shot after shot of them crawling.
12214806 12218351 And then this long dialogue scene got<br />squashed into the last two or three hours.
12218435 12221938 It's… Sometimes you set out on the day.<br />And you don't quite judge it properly,
12222022 12224398 and you end up<br />realizing, when it's too late
12224482 12228236 that you've emphasized… You've spent<br />most of your time on the wrong thing.
12228320 12231572 And I realized, "Oh, God. I've got<br />this incredibly important dialogue scene"
12231656 12233574 "to shoot." And…<br />And we were literally losing the light.
12233658 12234909 The sun was going down fast.
12234993 12238246 It was about 4:00 in the<br />afternoon when we started.
12238413 12243335 And so, what we did is we just did it in…<br />In basically in two shots
12243501 12245086 because that's all we had time for.
12245170 12248172 We did… We started by shooting<br />the close-ups of Sean and Elijah,
12248256 12250675 and we shot them together.<br />So we had one camera
12250759 12254512 our A camera on Elijah and our B camera<br />on Sean, which you don't normally do.
12254596 12257056 Normally, you shoot one actor, and<br />then you turn the cameras around,
12257140 12259767 and you shoot the other actor separately,<br />but I didn't have time for that.
12259851 12262301 So I actually did what<br />they call cross coverage
12262437 12265147 where you're shooting…<br />You're shooting them both simultaneously.
12265231 12268281 And we did… We did three<br />takes, is all that we had time for.
12268401 12270131 And we literally<br />couldn't do a fourth take.
12270173 12271862 Because we were losing the light so fast.
12271946 12274240 And we had time to do one<br />wide shot, which I also needed,
12274324 12276367 and I did that with an<br />A and B camera as well.
12276451 12280455 So when it cuts to the wide shot<br />of them picking him up and stuff
12280622 12282722 that's… That's the other, wider camera.
12282874 12288296 And it's just… It was done as a<br />rush, but they threw themselves into it.
12288463 12291674 And Sean was amazing. Elijah was great.
12291841 12296262 And what you see here is what we<br />got in a hurry at the end of the day.
12306898 12309148 We were back here,<br />and we'd seen the rushes,
12309275 12311236 and we sent the boys a fax.
12311403 12313988 And we made it look really<br />formal, like it was a memo.
12314072 12317617 On the next page we…<br />We put, "You made us cry."
12325625 12329671 It was based around the idea that<br />Sauron is coming out to face Aragorn.
12329838 12332840 And what you're seeing here of<br />Aragorn walking towards the Eye
12332924 12335217 Viggo was actually walking<br />towards Sauron on the day
12335301 12337345 that we shot it four<br />years ago on the desert.
12337429 12339180 He's moving towards Annatar.
12339347 12341433 Well, yeah. Well, don't get…
12341599 12344686 It was a vision.<br />A vision which turns out to be Sauron.
12348606 12350399 And we thought, "Well,<br />he's just an eyeball,
12350483 12353278 so it's gonna have to be<br />a kind of projected vision."
12353445 12355071 And we also thought<br />it would be interesting
12355155 12359409 because you didn't want the big<br />14-foot warrior to come out immediately
12359576 12362005 that… That you're waiting to see the most
12362047 12364289 hideous being on the earth, the most…
12364456 12367750 An embodiment of evil.<br />And in fact he's beautiful.
12367917 12371212 So we had this conceit for a long<br />time that we just threw out there
12371296 12373005 that actually Sauron would appear,
12373089 12375925 and he would be the most<br />beautiful man you've ever seen
12376009 12379971 which is, of course, Annatar, the way it…<br />In which he fought the Elves.
12380138 12382765 -Sauron the Fair.<br />-Yeah, Sauron the Fair. Yeah.
12386144 12387853 …and we were back to the<br />beginning of the first one…
12387937 12389522 …not coming up with<br />anything new or different.
12389606 12391232 -It was the same imagery…<br />-Yeah.
12391316 12393485 …that when Sauron's bashing…
12393651 12396443 …the hell out of<br />Isildur at the beginning.
12396485 12396863 Yeah.
12399699 12401492 -…which have your showdown between…<br />-Yeah, yeah.
12401576 12403453 …your big hero and your villain.
12410502 12413630 We'd shot a version<br />of this scene similar.
12413796 12417342 Similar, but not as good<br />in our original shoot.
12417509 12420010 And it was this… It was the…<br />I think it was about the first time
12420094 12421887 we ever filmed anything with Gollum,
12421971 12424390 and we didn't really<br />know what we were doing,
12424474 12426124 and how it was all gonna work.
12426267 12429061 And I realized when I looked at the<br />footage that we did the first time around
12429145 12432315 that the fight was just<br />not gonna be very good
12432482 12434609 because we hadn't shot it properly.
12434776 12439030 We hadn't quite done it in<br />the way that we subsequently
12439197 12441797 got much more experience<br />at doing Gollum's scenes.
12443451 12444869 -"Sméagol lied"?<br />-No.
12449541 12452042 I mean, we did write some new<br />dialogue for it and changed it a bit,
12452126 12454086 but it was basically redoing something
12454170 12458299 that we had a crack at<br />about three years earlier.
12461052 12464138 "Sméagol promised, Sméagol<br />lied," to show that actually everyone
12464222 12468226 who'd been sucked in by how nice<br />Sméagol was had misunderstood
12468393 12470270 the true nature of his character.
12475316 12477016 This was great cutting here, Pete.
12481406 12483407 Well, it's gonna make the<br />difference with these sorts of scenes
12483491 12487787 that you have any number of ways<br />you can go. We just shot lots of fighting.
12487954 12489163 You always shoot too much,
12489247 12491790 and then you just pick out the<br />very best little bits and pieces.
12491874 12494043 And there's so many ways<br />you could cut it together
12494127 12497422 and… And you have to figure<br />out how long are you gonna stay
12497589 12499289 with the Black Gate's battle
12500300 12502009 before you go to back to Frodo and Sam
12502093 12503677 and…<br />And where are Frodo and Sam gonna be?
12503761 12508558 And it's just a range of possibilities.
12515231 12517409 …we should bring the<br />moth in to at least tie
12517451 12519527 it back in to the old <i>Fellowship</i> imagery…
12519611 12521737 …that we had.<br />Because it is in the book, of course…
12521821 12523990 …that the eagles arrive at the end.
12524157 12528870 It does make you wonder why they<br />didn't summon an eagle at Rivendell,
12529037 12531789 and just have the eagle fly to Mordor.
12531956 12533124 Because the Nazgûl
12533458 12534667 would have taken them out.
12534751 12536377 Yes, I know.<br />We've already discussed that, haven't we?
12536461 12538504 Everybody always says that, but…
12539589 12542675 When we were editing <i>The<br />Return of the King</i> last year
12542842 12544468 I remember at one stage thinking:
12544552 12548014 "You know, what if…<br />If I keep going in chronological order
12548181 12551100 I'm gonna run out of time,<br />and the last, you know
12551267 12553853 half an hour of the film<br />is gonna get rushed."
12554020 12556564 And I knew that the editing of<br />this was gonna be something
12556648 12561611 that was… Had to be felt right. So I<br />jumped out of cutting earlier material,
12561778 12563988 and I just started to edit.
12564155 12566949 And I said, "If I…<br />If I'm gonna spend any time on something
12567033 12570911 in this film in the editing room, it's<br />gotta be these last climactic sequences.
12570995 12574123 And… And if I'm rushing things at<br />the end, I'd rather rush other stuff."
12574207 12579128 So I… I jumped onto this, and I<br />spent a lot of time with Jamie Selkirk
12580213 12584217 editing this sequence and<br />really trying to make it work.
12584384 12585991 And we tried two or<br />three different things,
12586033 12587720 and then eventually<br />it just sort of clicked.
12587804 12590848 We just…<br />We just got it, and it worked and…
12591015 12593365 -It's really good.<br />-And it never really changed.
12596187 12598137 I can't remember now. I can't remember.
12599399 12600649 -All the rest of it.<br />-All the rest of it.
12600733 12602610 Everything else.
12609033 12611577 It was just a bit of stone wall, really
12611744 12614079 was just about all it was,<br />with a little piece of rock.
12614163 12618084 And most of the wide shots are a<br />miniature, and we just put so much smoke,
12618251 12620836 and colored light in there that we…<br />We got away with it.
12620920 12624882 It was actually… I'm… I'm quite<br />pleased with the way that it ended up
12625049 12626718 considering how simple it was.
12629053 12630243 Who designed the Crack of Doom?
12630285 12632056 I…<br />I actually feel it was mainly John Howe.
12632140 12636090 At the beginning I… I think that was<br />one of the things that we got John to do.
12640648 12643401 But at the time it probably<br />wasn't such a dodgy name.
12643568 12645235 -Why is it dodgy?<br />-Well, it just sounds like
12645319 12649239 something out of Dungeons & Dragons or,
12649323 12652535 you know, sort of B-grade fantasy.
12652702 12655302 -Don't you think, "Crack of Doom"?<br />-The sex industry.
12656080 12659584 -Oh, God.<br />-Hey, shush, shush, shush.
12666674 12669968 …because… Because in one way or<br />another everything's leading up to it…
12670052 12672304 …and… And you just don't<br />want it to be disappointing.
12672388 12675892 And it's tricky for the actors.<br />It's tricky for… For everybody.
12676058 12680396 Sean and Elijah are always just…<br />Just committed to it so, so deeply.
12680563 12682398 I… That's an image I always wanted to see
12682482 12685526 which was Gollum on top of<br />the invisible Frodo's shoulders.
12685610 12688362 I thought that would look really cool.
12689781 12692681 Now, the… The interesting<br />thing with this troll is that
12692784 12695203 this is using the Sauron fight footage.
12695369 12698069 We painted Sauron out, and…<br />And we put the troll in
12698206 12701333 because we never shot anything<br />of Aragorn fighting the troll.
12701417 12703919 We shot a little bit of him at the<br />end, actually, lying on the ground,
12704003 12707089 but we decided that the best fight<br />footage we could use was actually
12707173 12711052 the original footage<br />of him fighting Sauron.
12712637 12714138 I didn't wanna wimp out
12714305 12717433 at showing the whole thing of<br />Frodo's finger getting bitten off.
12717517 12720769 I wanted that to be fairly graphic,<br />just to be what it was, with lots of blood
12720853 12723105 because I just…<br />I thought at this stage in the movie you…
12723189 12727652 You… You just can't afford to…<br />To not go there, you know.
12734742 12737161 …a film camera through, obviously.
12737328 12740957 Unless you have one of those<br />cameras that they stick up your bottom.
12741123 12742416 But we won't talk about that.
12742500 12746546 But, in a computer, you<br />can actually just pass through
12746712 12749048 a tiny object like a Ring and…
12749215 12750265 -Sorry.<br />-Laparoscopic!
12750383 12754470 Laparoscopic… A laparoscopic<br />camera passing through the Ring.
12754637 12756848 -Yes, indeed.<br />-Don't even…
12759058 12761060 -I think he is.<br />-I know.
12766065 12769109 …on his two feet rather than all<br />fours for this moment at the end.
12769193 12770694 In fact, there was a<br />couple of times earlier
12770778 12773781 when I talked about Gollum lurching<br />to his feet, and he just refused.
12773865 12775574 Andy said, "No, we've gotta<br />do that in the Crack of Doom.
12775658 12777117 We've gotta save that.<br />We've gotta save that."
12777201 12778285 I think he was probably thinking:
12778369 12781038 "How can I show the Ring<br />empowering my character?"
12781205 12783582 He really wanted to make<br />something of the fact that the Ring,
12783666 12786544 and standing up like a<br />normal human being was a way
12786711 12789961 that Andy felt he… He could<br />actually show the Ring doing that.
12795720 12798305 …and then accidentally falling into the…<br />The lava…
12798389 12799807 …which is basically what<br />happens in the book.
12799891 12801795 I just, personally… I know why Tolkien
12801837 12803977 did it, and I know all<br />the arguments for it,
12804061 12805938 but I just never wanted to do that.
12806022 12808607 I felt so strongly that Frodo<br />had to be some part of it.
12808691 12809692 Yes.
12809859 12811235 -We shot it three ways.<br />-We did.
12811319 12813737 We shot… The first time,<br />we shot Frodo murdering him
12813821 12815471 basically just shoving him in.
12815573 12818158 Then we shot the book, which<br />was Gollum dancing around,
12818242 12820285 -and tripping and falling in himself.<br />-Which didn't work either.
12820369 12822246 And then… Then we did this version
12822330 12824373 which was actually done right…<br />Right at the very end, wasn't it?
12824457 12828127 It was done on…<br />On just about Elijah's last day, I think.
12830087 12831922 This is the shot that was the last shot
12832006 12835006 that Weta delivered for the<br />theatrical <i>Return of the King.</i>
12835134 12838763 This is… This was being worked<br />on right up until it was too late
12838930 12840430 because it was a tough shot to do.
12840514 12843434 How do you show this bloody<br />Ring finally being destroyed?
12843601 12846101 Originally this wasn't<br />gonna be the way it was cut.
12848397 12850274 …then we were gonna show all of this…<br />The saving sequence.
12850358 12851984 We're gonna have the two separated,
12852068 12854768 but we ended up editing it.<br />Like, crosscutting it
12854904 12856642 between the two events to make it seem
12856684 12858699 like it was all happening<br />at the same time.
12858783 12860833 Yeah, that was a late thought, wasn't it?
12865164 12867072 It felt like the climax of the film was
12867114 12869264 dissipated over too<br />great a period of time.
12869418 12871337 And that was when we all talked about:
12871963 12873213 "Well, you know, what if…
12873297 12874673 What if we collapsed<br />it all into one moment?"
12874757 12876300 Yes.
12881973 12884809 And you actually dread it<br />because you're just worried
12884976 12886685 that it's not gonna<br />live up to expectations.
12886769 12889814 And it was basically<br />the destruction of Mordor.
12889981 12891607 What happens when<br />the Ring gets destroyed?
12891691 12892900 I mean, that… That's a big question.
12892984 12895263 And it's not…<br />You know, it's not described
12895305 12897363 in great detail by Tolkien in the book,
12897530 12898822 but what happens to all the Orcs?
12898906 12901783 I mean, do they all drop down<br />dead when the Ring's destroyed, or…
12901867 12902826 I mean, what happens?
12902910 12905810 -What happens to… To Sauron?<br />-No, they do talk about it.
12908332 12909750 It's one of those things that's scary.
12909834 12912044 It's especially frightening<br />to have to visualize it
12912128 12914421 because you're worried that<br />you're not gonna do it justice, and…
12914505 12918509 We decided early on that the<br />destruction of the Black Tower
12918676 12922638 was gonna be a digital model, not<br />a model that we would blast apart
12922805 12926183 with pyrotechnics, like often you<br />see miniatures being destroyed
12926267 12928936 with little explosions.<br />And film them with slow motion.
12929020 12932023 And so we had one of our<br />CG artists, Gray Horsefield
12932189 12936152 spend literally months and<br />months building and designing
12936318 12938862 the destruction of Barad-dûr.<br />And he ultimately delivered the goods.
12938946 12942199 He did a great job, but it was<br />a very complicated job for him
12942366 12945452 to do it in the computer, and then…<br />I wanted some really biblical size.
12945536 12949957 I always regarded this as being…<br />This is… This has gotta be biblical,
12950124 12954045 and it's… Not just in size and<br />scale but also in the way you…
12954211 12956505 You portray the events.
12956672 12958632 It… It's like the parting<br />of the Red Sea, isn't it?
12958716 12965056 It's like… It's just some apocalyptic<br />vision, and I wanted it to have that scale
12965222 12967891 because I think the film deserves<br />it or the three movies deserve it.
12967975 12970217 You…<br />You get to this point, you've earned…
12970259 12972145 You've earned your sort of a… You…
12972229 12975900 You've earned the moment where<br />you can get to see this finally happen
12976067 12978902 because you've been trying to get<br />to this place and this moment in time,
12978986 12981197 for, like, you know, 10 or 11 hours.
12982531 12984408 -It's deliverance.<br />-Well, it is.
12995836 12997963 We actually realized one of those things…
12998297 13000799 We thought that we'd shot the<br />end of <i>The Return of the King</i>
13000883 13003510 you know, three or four<br />years ago in our original shoot.
13003594 13005137 But when we came to edit
13005346 13006346 this film together
13006430 13008557 we actually realized that one of<br />the things we hadn't really shot
13008641 13011685 was the reaction of everybody<br />else to the destruction of the Ring.
13011769 13013376 We literally just hadn't done it, because
13013418 13015188 we had…<br />I hadn't thought about it, really.
13015272 13017772 I think I'd shot Gandalf<br />reacting, but nobody else.
13017900 13021821 And so when each of our actors<br />came out for pickups last year
13021987 13025532 they each had their turn, because they<br />were in the country at different times.
13025616 13028452 They weren't all together.<br />So they each had their turn at reacting
13028536 13031455 to the… To the…<br />The destruction of Mordor.
13031622 13033957 And I'd put them in the costume<br />and have a few extras behind them,
13034041 13035167 and explain what was going on.
13035251 13039088 And so, you know,<br />Viggo did it, Ian did it again
13039255 13041799 Orlando did it, Billy did it, Dom did it.
13041966 13043509 They each had to do their bit.
13043676 13047054 And I wanted their reactions to be,<br />obviously, appropriate to their character,
13047138 13048889 and to be different from each other.
13048973 13051641 So we just went through a<br />variety of different performances.
13051725 13054436 And it's a hard thing to react to,<br />because you're literally just staring at
13054520 13056170 a piece of tape on the wall,
13056313 13060985 and yet you've got to portray<br />this cataclysmic, emotional event.
13061152 13063528 And I thought all of…<br />All of them did really well, you know.
13063612 13067366 There wasn't a… There wasn't a<br />bum note in the house, as they say.
13070661 13072361 The lava's all computer generated.
13072496 13074498 I think it's a combination,<br />actually, of computer generated,
13074582 13079503 and sort of a… A milk and syrup<br />mixture that they blasted in the air.
13089346 13091556 This scene wasn't so<br />difficult to shoot, really.
13091640 13093809 These scenes are sometimes a bit easier
13093976 13095644 because I had a fairly<br />clear idea in my mind
13095728 13098878 about what I wanted this<br />scene to feel like and to look like.
13099440 13102140 Some scenes you…<br />You know the moment you write them,
13102234 13104444 or the moment you think about them.<br />You know what you want them to be.
13104528 13106280 And they're ultimately easy.
13106447 13109407 So for, you know, a couple of years later,<br />you find yourself on the set, shooting,
13109491 13110701 and it's not so bad.
13110868 13112869 Other scenes like the destruction scenes,
13112953 13117166 or Frodo and…<br />With the Ring in the Crack of Doom
13117333 13118834 you dread some of these scenes
13118918 13121086 because you type them into the script
13121879 13123964 you talk about them, but<br />you really don't quite know
13124048 13126508 what they have to be or<br />what they should be like.
13126592 13129470 And you kind of dread the day<br />when you have to shoot them.
13129637 13132097 And you just hope that<br />when you arrive on that day
13132181 13133515 you've actually got a good idea.
13133599 13135475 And sometimes you do,<br />and sometimes you don't.
13135559 13137519 And usually, the…<br />The great thing I've discovered, though
13137603 13140730 is that if I don't have good ideas<br />on the day, often the actors do.
13140814 13142448 And sometimes you show up on set, and
13142490 13144484 you're just relying on<br />the actors, you know.
13144568 13146319 And if I don't have a good idea.<br />I might just say:
13146403 13149364 "Okay, boys, well, let's just block<br />the scene and run it through and…
13149448 13150949 "And show me what you think," you know.
13151033 13155079 And I sort of let…<br />Let them come up with something.
13157414 13160167 This was another moment<br />which I always imagined too
13160334 13162169 which was just this fade to black.
13162253 13164671 Because I wanted a real feeling<br />that it might have been the end,
13164755 13167091 and I wanted this long black patch.
13167258 13170844 And then I just wanted this image.<br />This was an image that was based,
13171011 13173889 or inspired, by a painting<br />that John Howe did.
13174056 13176433 It was this moment. This exact moment.
13176600 13178978 -And I remember seeing the painting.<br />-Yeah.
13179144 13181229 It was… It was while we were<br />in pre-production on the film
13181313 13182814 we hadn't shot anything yet and…
13182898 13189113 And that painting just gave me a sense<br />of exactly what this moment should be.
13197288 13199706 And then I wanted this to…<br />I never had a problem with this.
13199790 13204086 This is one of those sequences<br />that I had ingrained in my mind
13204253 13208549 about two or three years<br />before we ever shot it.
13209591 13211593 I sort of had this feeling<br />of what I wanted to do
13211677 13215222 with this fade to white and then the<br />dissolve through to Frodo in the bed.
13215306 13216806 -You know…<br />-It never changed.
13222271 13225121 I mean, you got to imagine,<br />you know, what… What do…
13225274 13228193 If you're…<br />If you're one of our actors playing
13228360 13230403 Frodo's friends, you know, the<br />other members of the Fellowship
13230487 13232489 I mean, what do you do?
13232656 13235367 What does your character<br />do when they see Frodo alive?
13235534 13238787 And I know…<br />I remember that discussion with Ian.
13238954 13241665 And I said to him, "Well, what…<br />What would Gandalf do?"
13241749 13245210 And Ian thought, and he said,<br />"I think Gandalf would laugh."
13245836 13248297 And so I said, "Okay, that sounds good.
13248464 13249923 Let's laugh then."
13250090 13251967 -And that's what he did.<br />-It's the… It's…
13252051 13253901 -And it's back where they were.<br />-Yeah.
13257473 13259173 -Talks about him laughing…<br />-Yeah.
13259266 13260267 …and his joy.
13263062 13265313 …everyone having to react<br />to the destruction of the Ring…
13265397 13266648 …that we just talked about, you know.
13266732 13269276 Now they're having to react<br />to Frodo, seeing Frodo again.
13269360 13270861 And… And so it's…
13271028 13272988 It's important moments…<br />Moment for the characters.
13273072 13275866 It's so important to get<br />them all together again.
13283040 13286627 It's really interesting.<br />There was such a strong reaction amongst
13286794 13288295 -people who had seen the film. And…<br />-Yeah.
13288379 13290839 And there was…<br />And there was some people that,
13291006 13294134 -for this, they sobbed at this moment.<br />-Yeah, yeah.
13294301 13297221 And then other people<br />absolutely hated it.
13297388 13299390 Of course, I think it's fantastic.
13302559 13304060 I mean, I know if I<br />was watching the movie
13304144 13305979 I'd… I'd want to see this<br />sort of scene, though.
13306063 13308763 I mean, this is…<br />It's exactly what I would wanna see.
13311193 13314093 …where at that moment, all<br />you can hear is the sniffling.
13314238 13316949 And it's like, "It's working."
13331797 13334466 I'm really very happy with this.
13343100 13346019 We'd written a whole conversation,<br />and I remember on the day
13346103 13349203 people turned up with those<br />pages, and you threw it all out.
13358907 13362202 This was another image that I had from<br />the beginning, of this climb up the prow.
13362286 13365080 Actually, I always imagined it<br />with confetti streaming down.
13365164 13369626 I always thought of that<br />being, like, a rain of confetti
13369793 13372963 sweeping past the camera<br />as you rise up past the…
13373130 13375298 Past the prow. I think that's what…<br />What was in our storyboards.
13375382 13377384 But we never… We never did that<br />in the movie at the end of the day.
13377468 13380637 Or petals, those little rose<br />petals, it was gonna be, not confetti.
13380721 13385225 This was a combination of original<br />stuff that we shot, with the crowd stuff
13385392 13387792 was…<br />And the wide shots were originally shot.
13387895 13393358 But we did pickups of the close-ups<br />of Gandalf and Aragorn basically
13393525 13396612 where… Where they were re-shot.
13411502 13413402 …that was his last shot on the film.
13415839 13417757 Yeah, that was…<br />Yeah, that was his last. It's interesting
13417841 13420891 you remember all those last<br />shots, don't you? You remember?
13422596 13425746 -…I remember thinking I was gonna get…<br />-Being told about it.
13426141 13427976 No, I was on the makeup stage with Andy
13428060 13429144 -and… And we wrapped late.<br />-Yeah.
13429228 13430603 -Oh, that's right.<br />-And you wrapped before us.
13430687 13431938 -That's right.<br />-I tried to get down there.
13432022 13433899 -Yeah, you did.<br />-That's right.
13437319 13440280 Because it was done at the time he<br />was doing everything else in the film
13440364 13442407 he obviously didn't have a beard.<br />So it was fake.
13442491 13445535 But when he came out to New Zealand<br />to do pickups, we… We said to him:
13445619 13447119 "Listen, can you grow a beard?
13447371 13450039 And we'll reshoot all the<br />close-ups of you with a real beard"
13450123 13451332 because the beard looked kind of fake.
13451416 13454127 And that was one of the reasons that we<br />wanted to reshoot the close-ups, actually.
13454211 13457213 And so he grew this beard, and<br />it was the first thing that we shot.
13457297 13460747 And then we had him shave it off<br />and do the rest of his Aragorn stuff.
13466431 13468539 It was Viggo's idea<br />to sing the song, which
13468581 13470831 is in the book, isn't it?<br />That Aragorn sings?
13472896 13475315 -Oh, okay. Oh, okay. He said he…<br />-He doesn't sing… No.
13475399 13476400 -No.<br />-No.
13476567 13477568 Oh.
13477734 13479584 But, I mean, it's great. It's very…
13482114 13484741 It's one of those things that<br />could work or might not work.
13484825 13486159 -Yeah.<br />-And…
13486326 13488745 But, you know, I…<br />I just think it's unexpected.
13488912 13492165 I mean, to have him turn<br />around and then to start singing
13492332 13494501 is… is unusual. It's… It's unexpected.
13494585 13495960 It… It feels like Tolkien.
13496044 13497504 And so therefore I think<br />it's a good thing to do.
13497588 13498589 It is Tolkien.
13498755 13502092 I think just the mere fact<br />that it's a surprise alone
13502259 13503909 makes it sort of<br />interesting, and then it…
13503951 13504177 Yeah.
13504261 13506763 I just think it's nice for his character.
13508348 13510100 This is a lovely moment for Liv.
13510267 13513061 Another one of those major events,<br />something we've been waiting for,
13513145 13515522 for three movies, to get<br />these two finally together.
13515606 13518816 And just figuring out how to shoot<br />this stuff is kind of tricky because…
13518900 13521361 Often, shooting it just<br />in a simple, elegant way
13521445 13523989 is better than making it overly complex.
13524156 13526533 When we redid this.<br />Some of this stuff in pickups
13526617 13530161 it was primarily for the beard, really,<br />because the fake beard did look fake.
13530245 13532895 And we changed the staging<br />of it a wee bit, didn't we?
13534541 13537252 -You wanted Elrond to be there with Arwen.<br />-That's right…
13537336 13539003 She was in a separate… In separate shots
13539087 13541423 with an incredibly unusual hairstyle.
13544009 13544411 Yeah.
13544453 13547638 Elrond's hairstyle<br />was very, very unusual.
13555228 13557773 And then I wanted them<br />to have a real good kiss
13557939 13560650 which we didn't have in the<br />original shooting either, did we?
13560734 13561985 I wanted them to just…
13562319 13564371 I just felt like they… They… They needed
13564413 13566364 to just… Because it was one of those…
13566448 13569576 It's a bit like what we were saying<br />with Gandalf, is "What do you do"
13569660 13571786 when you see Frodo's alive?"<br />Well, you laugh.
13571870 13574163 And what would these two do when<br />they come together, and you think:
13574247 13575540 "Well, of course, what would they do?
13575624 13577230 "They'd… They'd grab each other and…
13577272 13579043 And have a hell of a<br />great kiss," you know.
13579127 13581546 We just felt that's the most<br />obvious thing to do and…
13581630 13583756 And it also just breaks<br />that formality, you know
13583840 13586540 all the…<br />The pompous ceremony that's been going on.
13586677 13589805 -Just… Just get them together.<br />-Yeah.
13596103 13598772 This moment here is<br />probably my favorite moment
13598939 13602526 out of the entire trilogy, I would say.
13615247 13617897 This is a moment when<br />there's always a huge sniffle
13618041 13620043 in the audience when the film's playing.
13620127 13622504 And it's usually me.
13625048 13627967 It's interesting with the ending,<br />because this whole sequence
13628051 13631095 has copped, I guess, the most<br />criticism of <i>Return of the King.</i>
13631179 13634307 I wonder whether some of the<br />criticism was due to the bladder factor.
13634391 13636392 When I think, a lot of people,<br />they were getting to this point
13636476 13639312 they were just wanting the film to<br />end so they could rush out to the toilet.
13639396 13642982 So the fact that there was scene after<br />scene after scene for another 20 minutes
13643066 13645402 that possibly accentuated the sort of…
13645569 13648572 The whole multiple-ending<br />thing for some people.
13650449 13651658 -Oh.<br />-Now this…
13651825 13655662 This is interesting, this stuff here,<br />because we actually shot a little epilogue
13655746 13657997 that's for the other<br />characters, that we never used.
13658081 13660083 And I'm not using it in<br />the Extended Cut either
13660167 13662419 because it just doesn't really need it.
13662586 13665255 But we did a little bit of showing
13665422 13670677 what happened to Legolas,<br />to Gimli, to Faramir and Éowyn.
13675766 13678309 The scenes that have gone in<br />are the scenes that I just thought
13678393 13679477 would be fun to have in.
13679561 13681104 And… And fun is actually the word.
13681188 13685275 Not because they need to be in to<br />make the film better, not because they…
13685442 13688320 Putting them in sometimes<br />can make the film worse.
13688487 13690864 But those are not the reasons why.
13691031 13694117 The reasons why is that I think<br />they're just fun to have in and…
13694201 13696661 And, you know, the scenes that I<br />don't think are particularly fun to put in
13696745 13698955 I don't put it in, you know.<br />It's just that's…
13699039 13701541 Actually, fun is kind of<br />the best way to describe it.
13701625 13702675 I'm not… I'm not…
13702793 13707506 I don't make any decisions<br />any deeper than that, really.
13712135 13715472 This scene in the pub here is<br />actually one that we shot in pickups.
13715639 13718516 That… That all of the rest of the…<br />Of this last 20 minutes, is…
13718600 13721602 Most of it is original footage that<br />we did in our principal photography.
13721686 13724815 But this one sequence<br />here, we didn't have.
13724981 13727900 Oh, and Sam's wedding, too.<br />We didn't have. Those two sequences.
13727984 13730028 But this was important to me
13730195 13733490 because I felt that it actually<br />was what Tolkien had in mind.
13733657 13735199 And I wanted to dramatize it
13735283 13738286 because he had been a<br />soldier in the First World War.
13738453 13739746 And one of the things that…
13739830 13742957 That just about all veterans of<br />the First World War talk about
13743041 13745042 is the sense of coming<br />home to their families,
13745126 13747921 and their village, where they left from,
13748088 13751341 and they've been thoroughly<br />changed by the experience.
13751508 13753801 They've gone through horrors<br />that they could never describe.
13753885 13755762 And they literally couldn't<br />talk to anyone about it,
13755846 13757848 so therefore nobody understood.
13758014 13762064 And the only people that understood were<br />those other friends that had been to war.
13762227 13765981 And I wanted that feeling amongst<br />those four guys, that they were there,
13766147 13769609 but no one else knew<br />how heroic they really were.
13769776 13773321 And they didn't expect to<br />be treated like heroes either.
13773488 13776699 And I thought that was very true to<br />what Tolkien would have experienced
13776783 13779118 coming back from the<br />First World War, himself.
13779202 13780537 And then we didn't have…
13780704 13784374 We didn't have Sam's<br />wedding originally shot, either.
13784541 13788628 And we thought that this was a pickup<br />that we should do. It was worth doing.
13796052 13798387 …I think that we should bear<br />some responsibility for that…
13798471 13800098 …in terms of the storytelling.
13800265 13803142 Ultimate… Ultimately, if the point<br />is about the destruction of Frodo
13803226 13806354 then the audience should<br />be given that expectation
13806730 13808773 that they will know then<br />that there is more to come.
13808857 13811275 -But we never actually made that point.<br />-No, we didn't.
13811359 13812944 And if we had…
13813111 13816364 You know, had a bit more time,<br />dare I say, to shape the story
13816531 13818991 we could've… We probably would've<br />got there in the end, you know.
13819075 13821327 -We would have got there in the end.<br />-We'd have found a way to do that,
13821411 13823663 but we ran out of time to shape the end
13823830 13827380 in the way that I think we probably<br />could've alleviated some of this.
13831129 13833714 I remember I had a line in<br />there that was Frodo in VO going:
13833798 13836968 "Bilbo always told me that<br />the great stories never end."
13837135 13839095 -And Fran was saying…<br />-I wouldn't let her use it.
13839179 13841779 You wouldn't…<br />You wouldn't let us put it in there
13841890 13843850 because she was terrified<br />that it would point out
13843934 13846034 the fact that the story's never-ending.
13852984 13857364 That back shot of Frodo is<br />referencing the back shot on Bilbo.
13862869 13866164 The effects of this<br />journey, because this is…
13866331 13869681 This is some two or three years<br />after they've gotten home, isn't it?
13869834 13874381 And we… We did makeup on Elijah,<br />just make him seem pale and gaunt
13874547 13877801 like the color's never quite<br />come back into his cheeks.
13877968 13880679 And we wanted him to feel very…
13880971 13884221 I mean, "depressed" is not<br />quite the right word, but… But the…
13884307 13887059 The way that we shot the scene<br />was with colors that were sort of muted.
13887143 13890943 Everything was in shades of brown.<br />There wasn't any bright colors on the set.
13891064 13892732 We made sure the costumes weren't bright.
13892816 13895279 We did a lot of just subtle things to try
13895321 13898071 to…<br />To make the whole atmosphere seem drab.
13900991 13902575 He's not going to get better.
13910458 13912711 But no mind, we got there in the end.
13924055 13926016 Is that Elijah's last shot, Pete?
13929519 13931869 In fact, the…<br />The bit at the end when he says:
13932480 13935380 "There's room for a little<br />more," was the very last moment.
13936526 13938778 But we had Elijah recording<br />a lot more voice-over,
13938862 13941239 but it just felt too… Too much talking.
13941406 13943449 I can't even remember<br />now what we ended up using.
13943533 13947633 Not… Not a great deal, because a lot<br />of this just played better with music and…
13948455 13951555 -No, we used… There's some… Some…<br />-I don't quite… Yeah.
13952667 13954117 -…wrote and recorded.<br />-Yeah.
13956880 13958839 These were second-unit<br />shots done on Matamata
13958923 13960967 on the same farm as<br />where Hobbiton was built.
13961051 13963701 It was just around the<br />corner from Hobbiton, actually.
13965221 13967307 And this was
13967682 13969225 shot a long time ago.
13969392 13972311 That's a long, long time ago, when<br />Ian Holm was out in New Zealand
13972395 13974856 doing the stuff for<br /><i>Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
13975023 13977316 Because Ian…<br />Bilbo didn't appear in <i>The Two Towers,</i>
13977400 13980403 and he was just in this last sequence in
13980570 13983073 <i>Return of the King,</i> but<br />as a much older Bilbo.
13983239 13987327 And so Richard Taylor did this<br />prosthetic makeup and Gino and…
13987494 13989662 I know that Ian Holm was very<br />taken with the… With the makeup.
13989746 13993624 He loved standing in front of the mirror<br />and looking at it and playing with it.
13993708 13995334 I think he was very impressed with it.
13995418 13996920 It is pretty nice. It's a…
13997087 14001007 Old-men makeup is<br />a difficult thing to do,
14001382 14004177 and I…<br />And I think this works pretty well.
14006930 14008723 Grey Havens is another<br />one of those places
14008807 14011058 that hasn't really been<br />illustrated a great deal.
14011142 14013602 There's…<br />There's a couple of nice paintings that…
14013686 14016106 That have been done with it.
14016272 14019359 But I let…<br />We let Alan Lee go crazy on it.
14019526 14021902 And I remember actually<br />we were shooting in Hobbiton
14021986 14026741 the actual village of Hobbiton, when<br />Alan came on set one day in a windy field,
14026908 14031538 and was showing me his first drawings of…<br />Of the Grey Havens.
14032163 14033915 And…
14034082 14036834 And the very first drawing that<br />Alan ever showed me, I just said:
14036918 14039920 "Yep, that's perfect. That's exactly<br />what we… What we want to do."
14040004 14042256 And we never changed it, actually.<br />We never changed the concept
14042340 14045760 from that very first sketch of<br />this incredible harbor with these
14045844 14049055 buildings up the sides<br />of the harbor and towers.
14049472 14051391 And it was very Elvish.
14051558 14053768 Because I've never quite imagined<br />what the Grey Havens looks like.
14053852 14054978 No.
14059274 14061818 …that this was meant to represent death…
14061985 14063528 …or at least in our minds…
14063695 14067323 …whether or not that's what<br />Professor Tolkien was signifying.
14067490 14069325 That's what we wanted it to be.
14069492 14072787 And the fact that… That…
14072954 14075665 That if you're mortal<br />and you get on that boat
14075832 14078342 it… It's basically saying that you are
14078384 14081254 dying, and that's in<br />fact what Frodo's doing.
14081421 14084632 A lot of people pick up on<br />it, but some people don't.
14089387 14092182 …spiritually not… Not going to death.
14095768 14097729 …but he's not coming back.
14102483 14104833 She was only in New<br />Zealand for about two weeks.
14104944 14107279 And she shot all of her scenes<br />for <i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
14107363 14109281 And then all of her<br />little bits and pieces
14109365 14111784 appearing in <i>The Two<br />Towers</i> and <i>Return of the King</i>
14111868 14113035 were all shot at the same time.
14113119 14115496 And we needed Cate to<br />be here at the Grey Havens,
14115580 14118249 but it wasn't when we were shooting<br />the scene with the rest of the guys.
14118333 14122044 So we shot her all by herself against<br />blue screen, doing her little moments.
14122128 14123629 And that was… Was shot with her
14123713 14126465 several months before we did the<br />rest of the scene with everybody else.
14126549 14128467 So we didn't even quite know<br />what the scene was gonna be like
14128551 14130553 7… when we shot her shots.
14136392 14138477 That…<br />That's only recently turned up, hasn't it?
14138561 14139604 Yeah.
14142649 14145276 And they…<br />They will understand the meaning of it
14145443 14149572 because we never really got into<br />what the power of the three Rings were,
14149739 14153743 or, in fact, who the three Ring…<br />Ring-bearers of the Elven Rings were.
14153910 14156746 But they are in fact, Elrond
14156913 14161709 Galadriel, as she shows Frodo in…<br />In… In <i>Fellowship,</i>
14161876 14167090 and Gandalf. And you'll see here that<br />he is wearing Narya, the Ring of Fire.
14167257 14168883 Yeah.
14176891 14179226 And I don't mean that in the<br />sense of it being emotional
14179310 14183022 because that was okay and…<br />And the guys were doing an amazing job.
14183189 14186359 But we shot this scene in one day
14186526 14189445 very, very difficult, very emotional
14189612 14194200 lots of tears, because, you<br />know, they're not pretending.
14194367 14195974 They're…<br />They're doing this stuff for real
14196016 14197703 to get themselves<br />worked up into the emotion.
14197787 14202834 And we looked at it the following day,<br />and most of the footage was out of focus.
14203001 14207130 It was actually one of the most disastrous<br />days of shooting that we ever did.
14207297 14208964 Particularly because of what it was.
14209048 14214178 It was, like, we could not believe that<br />it was out of focus, most of the footage.
14214345 14217807 And we actually…<br />I had to break the news to the guys.
14217974 14221524 I remember walking on set and saying,<br />"You know that Grey Havens stuff?"
14221644 14225022 "Yeah, yeah." "Well, I had a look at the…<br />At the dailies last night."
14225106 14229736 "Oh, yeah, yeah?"<br />"And it was all out of focus."
14229861 14231737 And I remember them looking at me.<br />And I remember them saying:
14231821 14233948 "You… You're joking right?<br />You're kidding.
14234032 14235382 Yeah, this is not serious."
14236159 14238535 And I had to say, "Yeah, and<br />we're gonna have to reshoot it."
14238619 14241497 And we actually had to<br />go back and film it again.
14241664 14243582 And, you know, it's<br />one of those weird things
14243666 14247086 where you never quite know whether<br />it was as good the second time around.
14247170 14250673 I mean, I think it was, and I certainly<br />think they're doing an amazing job here.
14250757 14253676 But, you know, that's…
14258848 14260520 No, it wasn't.<br />It was another focus puller.
14260562 14261809 He didn't bugger this scene up.
14261893 14263686 -It was…<br />-No, no, somebody else.
14263853 14265855 Colin had gone to Australia, and
14266022 14269776 shortly thereafter we<br />begged him to return.
14289629 14292729 -And I just think it's beautiful.<br />-Yeah, that's very beautiful.
14298388 14301307 You know what I always remember,<br />too, when you talk about multiple endings?
14301391 14305478 And I… I think people have<br />to understand that this…
14305645 14310400 We're not ending one film, as<br />you said, Pete, we're ending three.
14310566 14313236 And this scene in<br />particular is doing that.
14316739 14318839 -That's the problem.<br />-That's not a problem.
14321119 14323162 …and, you know, the vast majority do…
14323246 14325497 …are people who were never<br />gonna engage in these movies…
14325581 14328631 -…or they engage in it to a certain…<br />-I think that's true.
14331421 14333839 I think some people like certain<br />types of films, and other people don't.
14333923 14336633 And… And… And, you know, no<br />one's gonna buy into any of this stuff
14336717 14339367 if they fundamentally<br />don't like <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>
14343599 14344892 …and seeing it with the guys.
14344976 14346352 -Seeing it with Elijah…<br />-Yeah.
14346436 14348688 -…and Billy and Dom and you.<br />-Yeah.
14348855 14351607 And it was phenomenal, and it worked.
14355570 14358322 …who aren't familiar with the<br />book, they really are in the dark here.
14358406 14360491 When does this movie end, exactly?
14360658 14362452 I would have no idea, because…
14369709 14371919 And you have the<br />gigantic climatic sequence,
14372003 14375422 and you have a small wrap-out, kind<br />of coda, which may be a few minutes…
14375506 14377549 You know, there's only<br />really one way of knowing…
14377633 14379583 And 20 minutes later, we're still here.
14382346 14385141 …and that's a… A Jell-O wrestle.
14385308 14388758 Where everybody that likes the…<br />Likes the endings goes on one side,
14388895 14391897 and everybody that doesn't goes on<br />the other, and they just wrestle it out
14391981 14393816 in a big pit of Jell-O.
14393983 14396235 And the ones that are left<br />standing at the end, are right.
14396319 14398669 And that's the only<br />way to really figure it out.
14399989 14401991 I think he's right.
14410875 14413419 I've worked with Sean's dad. John Astin,
14413586 14415421 and with Sean, and now Ally.
14415588 14417938 So I've worked with three<br />generations of Astins.
14419217 14420617 This is kind of interesting.
14420760 14423846 And I remember this day in particular,<br />another one of those little memories.
14423930 14427766 I was… I was… I was standing here with<br />Sean as we were shooting this scene.
14427850 14432647 And I said to him…<br />Because this was January 2000,
14432813 14434773 and I remember saying to<br />him, "You know what, Sean?
14434857 14436442 The scene that we're<br />shooting at the moment
14436526 14440029 it's gonna be nearly four<br />years before anybody sees this."
14440196 14442823 And… It both… It's, you know…<br />We looked at each other,
14442907 14445367 and it just seemed like an<br />incredible thought at the time.
14445451 14446618 And, you know, it's amazing.
14446702 14448537 It's amazing to me now<br />that four years has gone by,
14448621 14450581 and I'm looking at this, and I remem…<br />Remember that comment.
14450665 14452315 -And that's Sarah's…<br />-Sarah's…
14454544 14456587 Right. Oh, that was Sarah's baby.<br />Yeah, of course it was.
14456671 14460091 So, like, Sean and Sarah<br />both had their kids there.
14460299 14461926 Yeah.
14472562 14474814 I always wanted to end on the Hobbit.
14479068 14481320 -Because that's a…<br />-Yeah, that was obviously important, yeah.
14481404 14483698 That at least after everything we've done
14483864 14486214 we ended up on the<br />same page at the very end.
14488744 14491956 -That's right.<br />-…we honored the last line.
14497295 14501006 We just had the credits beginning,<br />and we kept the credits just very basic
14501090 14503968 which were just white<br />letters on black background.
14504135 14506887 And then because this<br />is truly the last credits
14507054 14509765 these are the genuine final credits.
14509932 14512726 I wanted them to feel like<br />they're the end of the three films.
14512810 14516063 So that you could chop the<br />credits off the first two almost,
14516230 14519191 and join it all together, and these<br />would become the final credits.
14519275 14521485 So I wanted them to<br />look and feel different
14521569 14524280 which is why we had Alan Lee do sketches.
14524447 14527783 Alan didn't actually do<br />many sketches for this.
14527950 14530035 We… We just looked in his…<br />In his notebook
14530119 14531203 because he kept these original…
14531287 14533789 These amazing sketch pads, or notebooks
14533956 14535999 all the way through the six<br />years he's worked on the films.
14536083 14540296 And we went through and raided a<br />lot of his little sketches and doodles
14540463 14543049 to be in the background of these shots.
14543215 14546052 And then we had Alan sketch<br />the actors' faces, though.
14546218 14547886 They were… They were special sketches
14547970 14549930 that he did just for this credit roll.
14550014 14551640 I just wanted to do something that…
14551724 14553892 And I… I loved the idea,<br />it was actually something
14553976 14555727 that I was talking about<br />once with Ian McKellen.
14555811 14558981 And we were talking<br />about how in the old movies
14559148 14562193 it was a particular fad<br />in the '60s, from memory
14562360 14564987 where you would sometimes have credits
14565154 14568323 where there'd be little shots of<br />actors when their names come up.
14568407 14570909 And sometimes they sort of would<br />smile or acknowledge the camera,
14570993 14572995 and do a little nod of the head.
14577333 14578792 …this… These particular images.
14578834 14580752 Yeah, we… We picked stills of the actors…
14580836 14584757 …and then we had Alan sketch on them,<br />and then we sort of did a half mixture.
14584924 14587385 They…<br />They're not pure sketches you're seeing.
14587551 14592181 They're sketches with a little mix<br />of actors' skin tones and flesh tones
14592348 14594850 just very subtly underneath.
14602024 14604276 I remember when we<br />were having a meeting about
14604360 14607405 who was gonna do the vocals for the…<br />For the end song.
14607571 14611534 And… Actually, we hadn't decided<br />whether it was gonna be male or female,
14611701 14615204 but then we decided that…<br />Who… Who was it?
14615371 14620251 The question was, who was the<br />voice of this final song gonna be?
14620418 14624046 And we decided it was<br />gonna be Galadriel, really,
14624213 14629635 and that led you back to a very, very<br />early thought you'd had, a long time ago
14629802 14631970 one of your favorite<br />singers, Annie Lennox
14632054 14633764 whose voice you've always loved.
14633848 14635391 And you… And it was…
14635558 14638060 When you said it, it was so right.
14638227 14639770 It was one of those<br />thoughts that was so right
14639854 14642481 that everybody in the room<br />got it and understood it.
14642565 14646402 And thank God she said yes.<br />She did a phenomenal job.
14649363 14651741 And you never know really
14651907 14655035 -when… When you don't have any…<br />-No.
14655202 14657371 …personal experience of<br />someone, how it's going to be.
14657455 14660705 -Yeah, collaboratively.<br />-But it just turned out to be really good.
14671677 14675473 …she would be the right person and…<br />And she so was.
14679935 14681937 …a young man called Cameron Duncan.
14686317 14687693 …to complete <i>The Return of the King…</i>
14687777 14691614 …we met Cameron, who's a…<br />A young New Zealand filmmaker.
14691781 14693949 He was 16 years old at the time.
14694116 14697787 And he was a very…<br />A very gifted filmmaker.
14700998 14703041 Yeah, right, you see a lot of<br />work from young filmmakers,
14703125 14706545 and this kid was the real thing.<br />It was, like, stunning, actually
14706629 14708088 -just how clever he was…<br />-Yeah.
14708172 14710758 -…frightening at that… That age. Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
14714261 14716111 …when we were shooting the pickups.
14716263 14720851 And he… It was a great thrill for<br />him to watch everything happening.
14721018 14723312 -Yeah, yeah.<br />-But Cameron had had
14723479 14726065 cancer the year before.
14726232 14729026 And during the…
14729235 14734865 Early in 2003, he had a<br />diagnosis of secondary… Relapse.
14735032 14737827 He had metastases that<br />were found in his lungs.
14737993 14739745 And so it was throughout that year
14739829 14743457 he also underwent various forms of…<br />Of chemotherapy.
14743624 14747474 And so his time with us was limited<br />because it would be in between treatments.
14747628 14750928 He'd be… He'd be going away overseas to…<br />To receive treatments.
14751048 14753300 And he was getting sicker.
14753717 14758514 And when we were in<br />England in August and writing
14758681 14760515 we were thinking about writing this song.
14760599 14765145 Cameron was very much with us in…<br />Certainly in spirit.
14765312 14766438 He was… He was actually getting…
14766522 14769024 He was getting chemo at<br />that time in New Zealand,
14769191 14771443 but he was calling us and emailing us.
14771527 14774029 -And he was making a little film.<br />-He was making a… A short film.
14774113 14775322 <i>-Strike Zone.</i> Yep.<br />-Another short film
14775406 14778242 which is called <i>Strike Zone,</i> which
14778409 14780411 -is a great testament to him…<br />-Yeah.
14780578 14783330 …and…<br />You know, his abilities as a filmmaker…
14783497 14785833 …and just who he is as a person.
14786000 14792339 And… And it was during that time<br />that it became more apparent to me
14792506 14796719 that he wasn't probably<br />gonna beat this thing
14796886 14802016 even though that wasn't something that<br />you like… You let yourself think about.
14802182 14805018 It felt like that he probably<br />wasn't gonna beat the cancer.
14805102 14807771 And so it was… It was odd
14807938 14812443 because of… The song is very much<br />about, you know, Frodo's passing.
14812610 14816989 But it, personally, for<br />me, was also about
14817156 14821577 reconciling the conflicted<br />feelings about lit… Cameron,
14821744 14824997 and what he was facing.
14825164 14826749 And…
14829793 14833005 We're having to write this with Annie.<br />And it was one job
14833172 14835674 on top of everything else that you<br />were doing with the film at the time.
14835758 14838508 You were doing ADR.<br />You were helping me with the edit
14838594 14839928 trying to fix the problems of the film.
14840012 14841888 And you had these lyrics to<br />write, and you were struggling.
14841972 14845935 And I remember it was only when<br />you sort of made a conscious decision
14846101 14849605 to write the song about Cameron<br />that it suddenly just went click.
14849772 14850773 -Didn't it?<br />-Yeah.
14850940 14852315 It was that sort of<br />moment when you decided
14852399 14854025 -it was about something…<br />-Yeah.
14854109 14856654 -…that you… That you cared about.<br />-Yeah.
14856820 14860741 -Yeah, and it…<br />-Or somebody.
14862993 14867873 So… And Cameron, in fact, he…
14868040 14870876 Philippa and I, on the day that we…
14871043 14875297 We were done with editing<br />the film, it was in November
14875464 14883430 of 2003 we… Philippa and I went out.
14883597 14885557 -We went… We were…<br />-We went shopping.
14885641 14888602 Shopping. And Cameron at that<br />point, he had gone to Houston…
14888686 14891479 To a hospital in Houston to<br />have an experimental chemo
14891563 14895025 to try and beat these<br />fast-growing tumors in his lungs.
14895192 14898320 And we got home from<br />our first day out, wasn't it?
14902282 14906161 …what next, and what if this doesn't work?<br />This treatment doesn't work?
14906328 14908747 And we had driven home<br />from Eastbourne the whole way.
14908831 14912668 And I put the song on because<br />I'd fallen in love with it and…
14912835 14916839 And… And we were playing it and…
14917006 14919883 But we were feeling like,<br />"Well, there's maybe this,
14920050 14924221 and he can look at doing this."<br />And… Anyway, we got home.
14926724 14930602 …which was very<br />unusual to find him there.
14930769 14933731 And he told us that Cameron had died
14934023 14935607 a few hours earlier.
14935774 14937568 And…
14937943 14940487 And it was odd, because it was…<br />I mean, it was…
14940654 14944616 It was terribly shocking<br />to me, even though I had…
14944783 14948704 Knew that I had… Should expect it.<br />It was incredibly shocking.
14948871 14952708 And… And…
14952875 14957713 It was… It kind of came at the end of…<br />Right at the end of the film.
14957880 14960841 It was like two things coming together.
14961008 14963426 It was a great shame he<br />never saw it, in fact, because…
14963510 14965637 -I know, that's the one thing…<br />-I know. He loved it.
14965721 14968139 …is that he would have<br />loved to have seen the film.
14968223 14971143 And he… His body was brought back on the…
14971310 14973270 Weirdly, on the Air New Zealand plane
14973437 14976356 that had Frodo painted<br />on the side, which…
14976523 14978923 -Which… His family…<br />-Which he would've loved.
14979068 14980902 …brought him back, Sharon and Rhys and…
14980986 14982936 And Tarryn and Chanel brought him home.
14988243 14991192 I mean, that was the<br />first time that anybody
14991234 14993749 had ever heard the song outside of us
14993916 14996335 was we played it at his funeral.
14996502 14998253 -Yeah.<br />-So that…
14998420 15001590 You know, the song has a…<br />Has a connection,
15001757 15004468 for us with Cameron that's…<br />That is very profound.
15004635 15007262 Yep. We did…
15014311 15017189 I know all kids are special,<br />but he was extra special.
15017815 15020275 And a lot of people felt it.
15024863 15027783 …to the fans out there, thank you.
15027950 15031700 The ones… Especially the ones who<br />have bothered to listen to us raving on.
15034832 15037584 Can we… Can we say thank you to them?
15037751 15040170 Because you did…
15040337 15044424 In the end, you did inspire us, and<br />you did keep us on our toes and…
15044508 15046176 -Yeah, I… I agree with that.<br />-You did make us wanna…
15046260 15047427 I agree with that. I mean, I…
15047511 15050761 -You know, it… It's… It's…<br />-You're a big part of this movie.
15053642 15056936 And, you know, you get a lot of<br />letters with people's ideas, you know:
15057020 15058688 "Why don't you do this.<br />Why don't you do that?"
15058772 15061107 And that…<br />That's not really how fans influence you.
15061191 15063402 But what… What it is
15063569 15067322 is it's the realization that there's<br />such an expectation out there
15067489 15071034 that you become terrified of…<br />Of letting the fans down.
15071201 15074579 And it… And it's the fear factor.<br />Which is actually a valuable thing
15074663 15077499 because I think fear is<br />a great motivating force.
15077666 15080418 And you… You realize you<br />have a responsibility to people
15080502 15083296 who care so much about<br />this book, not to let them down.
15083380 15088260 And I've really appreciated that. I've<br />actually appreciated all of the fans'…
15088427 15090053 Their… Their enjoyment of these films
15090137 15092639 and… And the sense of<br />responsibility that that's given us
15092723 15094891 to have to deliver them the<br />best possible film we could make.
15094975 15098854 Because that forces us to go above
15099021 15101731 where we might naturally<br />have stopped in our standards.
15101815 15104192 But we go further because<br />there's other people
15104276 15106283 that care so much<br />about this, not just us.
15106325 15106611 Yeah.
15106695 15108488 And that's actually a<br />really valuable thing,
15108530 15110198 and I… And I feel… Feel so grateful.
15110282 15114119 I think it has had a significant<br />impact on shaping these films.
15114286 15115662 Yeah.
15119208 15123128 A bit like Frodo on the rock, "It's over.<br />It's done."
15127341 15130219 Is that the concept of… Of it being done
15130385 15133305 is only just very minor in<br />the sense of our own work.
15133472 15136057 You know, okay, we don't have<br />to go in and mix the film anymore.
15136141 15138518 We don't have to look at<br />visual-effects shots anymore.
15138602 15140187 But, man, this is never done.
15140354 15143022 This is gonna be part of our lives for…<br />Till the day we die.
15143106 15145650 I mean, that's the…<br />The reality of it is now that you…
15145734 15148570 This is something that's so big<br />that you can't walk away from it.
15148654 15151573 So the… So…<br />So the concept like a normal movie…
15151740 15153366 And we've done it in<br />the past with other films
15153450 15154838 where you can say, "Okay, that film is
15154880 15156536 finished.<br />We're moving on to our next film."
15156620 15158247 And you literally… The…
15158497 15160916 The other films do fade away eventually.
15161083 15164169 You know, especially some of the…<br />The early films we've made.
15164253 15167339 And you literally, you know,<br />hardly ever hear of them again.
15167506 15169675 But this one isn't gonna be like that.
15169841 15174263 This one is gonna be there, big,<br />front and center, for evermore.
15174429 15176348 Absolutely.
15179059 15181109 …and you go through, and you follow Sam?
15182562 15184812 -Oh, they got lost on… Last Friday.<br />-Did it?
15187109 15189110 I think that we lo…<br />When we lost that footage
15189194 15192698 we really lost the true <i>rappel</i> on the…<br />On the film.
15196285 15197994 -The kids were incredible.<br />-That sort of jumping forward.
15198078 15200578 -With Merry and Pippin.<br />-And… And Frodo grown up.
15206586 15208922 …where Sam goes to the post office<br />to check his mail the following day.
15209006 15212551 And the scene where he takes his<br />dog to the vet was also a great one.
15213802 15216305 So we just need to
15216471 15219891 let these people get to bed, and we… We<br />better go looking for this lost footage.
15219975 15223225 -I'm a bit disturbed about that.<br />-I know, you've lost a lot of it.
15223312 15224896 -Yeah.<br />-How… How much do you think
15224980 15227430 -that lost footage is valued at?<br />-I don't know.
15229568 15230652 Okay.
15230819 15232404 -So thank you.<br />-Thank you.
15232571 15234531 Yes, thank you.
