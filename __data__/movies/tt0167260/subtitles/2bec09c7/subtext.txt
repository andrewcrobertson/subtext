706787 709247 Be careful.
709248 712283 Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.
712284 716754 - Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.<br />- No.
716755 719941 We need him alive.

735733 739110 Can we not have peace, you and I?
739111 742297 We shall have peace.
742948 745241 We shall have peace...
745242 749454 ...when you answer for the<br />burning of the Westfold...
749455 752957 ...and the children that lie dead there!
752958 757295 We shall have peace when<br />the lives of the soldiers...

759806 764636 ...against the gates of<br />the Hornburg, are avenged!

776148 779150 Gibbets and crows?
779151 781861 Dotard!
781862 785698 What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?
785699 788768 Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.
788769 791496 Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...
791497 795667 ...along with the crowns of the seven<br />kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!
795668 798795 Your treachery has already cost many lives.
798796 801339 Thousands more are now at risk.
801340 803841 But you could save them, Saruman.
803842 806344 You were deep in the enemy's counsel.
806345 810265 So you have come here for information.
810516 813686 I have some for you.
817815 820900 Something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.
820901 825047 Something that you have failed to see.
825698 830201 But the Great Eye has seen it.
830202 835352 Even now he presses his advantage.
835708 839538 His attack will come soon.
841213 845033 You're all going to die.
845884 849262 But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?
849263 854058 You cannot think that this Ranger will<br />ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.
854059 861482 This exile, crept from the shadows,<br />will never be crowned king.
861483 866070 Gandalf does not hesitate to<br />sacrifice those closest to him...
866071 869365 ...those he professes to love.
869366 874078 Tell me, what words of comfort<br />did you give the Half ling...
874079 876622 ...before you sent him to his doom?
876623 879500 <font color=#ff00ff>[SIGHS]</font>
879501 884589 The path that you have set<br />him on can only lead to death.

946735 951238 ...and their brats roll on<br />the floor with the dogs?
951289 958037 The victory at Helm's Deep does not<br />belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.
958038 963388 You are a lesser son of greater sires.

967506 969715 ...come down.

1503708 1508545 Not very nice at all, my love.

1513551 1518555 And when she throws away the<br />bones and the empty clothes...
1518556 1521767 ...then we will find it.

1536574 1541245 The precious will be ours...
1541246 1545796 ...once the Hobbitses are dead!
1546251 1548419 You treacherous little toad!

1550422 1555426 - No! No! Master!<br />- No, Sam! Leave him alone!
1555427 1558262 I heard it from his own<br />mouth. He means to murder us.
1558263 1562933 Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.
1562934 1564435 <font color=#ff00ff>[YELLS]</font>
1564436 1566645 He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...
1566646 1568439 ...who hates Sméagol...
1568440 1571358 ...and who makes up nasty lies.
1571359 1574445 You miserable little maggot!<br />I'll stove your head in!
1574446 1576113 Sam!
1576114 1579324 <font color=#FF551>SAM:</font> Call me a liar? You're a liar!
1579325 1583954 - You scare him off, we're lost!<br />- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.
1583955 1586957 - I won't wait around for him to kill us!<br />- I'm not sending him away.
1586958 1588667 <font color=#FF551>SAM:</font> You don't see it, do you?
1588668 1591128 He's a villain.
1591129 1595591 We can't do this by ourselves,<br />Sam. Not without a guide.
1595592 1598969 I need you on my side.
1599220 1602848 I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.
1603099 1606602 I know, Sam. I know.
1606603 1608729 Trust me.
1608730 1611580 Come, Sméagol.

1679050 1682236 What time is it?
1682887 1686051 Not yet dawn.
1691271 1694481 I dreamed I saw a great wave...
1694482 1699736 ...climbing over green<br />lands and above the hills.
1699737 1703115 I stood upon the brink.
1703116 1708245 It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.
1708246 1711623 A light shone behind me...
1711624 1714251 ...but I could not turn.
1714252 1718439 I could only stand there, waiting.
1719090 1722217 Night changes many thoughts.
1722218 1724928 Sleep, Éowyn.
1724929 1728200 Sleep...
1729851 1733701 ...while you can.
1755877 1758521 The stars are veiled.
1759172 1763192 Something stirs in the east.
1763343 1766693 A sleepless malice.
1768556 1772906 The Eye of the enemy is moving.

1918331 1922626 Gandalf,... forgive me.
1922627 1924669 <font color=#FF551>GANDALF:</font> Look at me.
1924670 1928020 What did you see?
1930009 1932903 A tree.
1933054 1935297 There was a white tree...
1935298 1938723 ...in a courtyard of stone.
1939394 1942544 It was dead.
1944857 1946858 The city was burning.
1946859 1950904 Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
1950905 1953755 I saw...
1956327 1959155 I saw him.
1960706 1963125 I could hear his voice in my head.
1963126 1965710 And what did you tell him?
1965711 1968561 Speak!
1971717 1975053 He asked me my name. I didn't answer.
1975054 1976680 He hurt me.
1976681 1981001 What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
1982645 1985939 There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.
1985940 1988358 A fool...
1988359 1991111 ...but an honest fool he remains.
1991112 1995699 He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
1995700 1998243 We've been strangely fortunate.
1998244 2003039 Pippin saw in the palantír a<br />glimpse of the enemy's plan.
2003040 2007586 Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.
2007587 2011506 His defeat at Helm's Deep<br />showed our enemy one thing.
2011507 2014009 He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.
2014010 2016303 Men are not as weak as he supposed.
2016304 2020307 There is courage still, strength<br />enough perhaps to challenge him.
2020308 2022350 Sauron fears this.
2022351 2027856 He will not risk the peoples of<br />Middle-earth uniting under one banner.
2027857 2030442 He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...
2030443 2034112 ...before he sees a king<br />return to the throne of Men.
2034113 2038950 If the beacons of Gondor are<br />lit, Rohan must be ready for war.
2038951 2041328 Tell me...
2041329 2046479 ...why should we ride to the aid<br />of those who did not come to ours?
2049003 2051963 What do we owe Gondor?
2051964 2054174 - I will go.<br />- No!
2054175 2058725 - They must be warned.<br />- They will be.
2060765 2063850 You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
2063851 2069001 Follow the river. Look to the black ships.
2069273 2071399 Understand this:
2071400 2075970 Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
2076572 2080859 I ride for Minas Tirith...
2080910 2085080 ...and I won't be going alone.
2085331 2090001 Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,<br />Peregrin Took, you are the worst.
2090002 2093021 Hurry! Hurry!
2093172 2094756 Where are we going?
2094757 2096174 Why did you look?
2096175 2099094 Why do you always have to look?
2099095 2102639 - I don't know. I can't help it.<br />- You never can.
2102640 2105792 I'm sorry, all right?
2106143 2109813 - I won't do it again.<br />- Don't you understand?
2109814 2111940 The enemy thinks you have the Ring.
2111941 2117112 He's going to be looking for you,<br />Pip. They have to get you out of here.
2117113 2121442 And you...? You're coming with me?
2121993 2123577 Merry?
2123578 2126428 Come on.
2130376 2131918 How far is Minas Tirith?
2131919 2134713 Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.
2134714 2138925 And you better hope we don't<br />have one of those on our tail.
2138926 2140594 Here.
2140595 2143263 Something for the road.
2143264 2145390 The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
2145391 2149561 I know you've run out. You<br />smoke too much, Pippin.
2149562 2153712 But... But we'll see each other soon.
2155401 2159629 - Won't we?<br />- I don't know.
2159780 2162115 <font color=#ff00ff>[TEARFULLY]</font> I don't know what's going to happen.
2162116 2163992 - Merry.<br />- Run, Shadowfax.
2163993 2168470 - Show us the meaning of haste.<br />- Merry!
2178007 2180857 Merry!
2189602 2191770 He's always followed me...
2191771 2194147 ...everywhere I went...
2194148 2197108 ...since before we were tweens.
2197109 2201196 I would get him into the<br />worst sort of trouble...
2201197 2205392 ...but I was always there to get him out.
2205743 2208637 Now he's gone.
2209288 2212832 Just like... Frodo and Sam.
2212833 2215752 One thing I have learned about Hobbits:
2215753 2217962 They're a most hardy folk.
2217963 2222513 Foolhardy, maybe... He's a Took.

2369907 2374577 You saw there was a child. You saw my son.
2374578 2377288 <font color=#FF551>ELROND:</font> That future is almost gone.

2557553 2560703 City of kings.
2591253 2594603 Make Way!
2622242 2624243 It's the tree.
2624244 2626079 Gandalf. Gandalf.
2626080 2628498 <font color=#FF551>GANDALF:</font> Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.
2628499 2630500 The tree of the king.
2630501 2633336 Lord Denethor, however, is not king.
2633337 2636756 He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
2636757 2640843 Now listen carefully. Lord<br />Denethor is Boromir's father.
2640844 2645098 To give him news of his beloved<br />son's death would be most unwise.
2645099 2649435 And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.
2649436 2653873 And say nothing of Aragorn either.
2654024 2659374 In fact, it's better if you don't<br />speak at all, Peregrin Took.
2688058 2695708 Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,<br />lord and steward of Gondor.
2700070 2705741 I come with tidings in this<br />dark hour, and with counsel.
2705742 2709892 Perhaps you come to explain this.
2714751 2720601 Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.

2736940 2738774 ...my kinsman and me.
2738775 2743625 - He fell defending us from many foes.<br />- Pippin.
2747784 2751787 I offer you my service, such as it is...
2751788 2755908 ...in payment of this debt.
2755959 2760004 This is my first command to you.
2760005 2763799 How did you escape and my son did not...
2763800 2766802 ...so mighty a man as he was?
2766803 2770389 The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...
2770390 2775540 ...and Boromir was pierced by many.
2776438 2778314 Get up.
2778315 2783402 My lord, there will be a<br />time to grieve for Boromir...
2783403 2785863 ...but it is not now.
2785864 2788407 War is coming.
2788408 2793195 The enemy is on your doorstep.<br />As steward, you are charged...
2793196 2797333 ...with the defense of this<br />city. Where are Gondor's armies?
2797334 2802380 You still have friends. You<br />are not alone in this fight.
2802381 2808469 Send word to Théoden of<br />Rohan. Light the beacons.
2808470 2812181 You think you are wise, Mithrandir.
2812182 2817052 Yet for all your subtleties,<br />you have not wisdom.
2817354 2821691 Do you think the eyes of<br />the White Tower are blind?
2821692 2824944 I have seen more than you know.
2824945 2828322 With your left hand you would use<br />me as a shield against Mordor.
2828323 2831367 And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.
2831368 2835246 I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.
2835247 2841377 Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears<br />of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
2841378 2846382 And I tell you now, I will not bow<br />to this Ranger from the North...
2846383 2851053 ...last of a ragged house<br />long bereft of lordship.
2851054 2857059 Authority is not given to you to<br />deny the return of the king, steward.
2857060 2862910 The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.
2866653 2869463 <font color=#FF551>GANDALF:</font> Come.
2876371 2879123 All has turned to vain ambition.
2879124 2883474 He would even use his grief as a cloak.
2885464 2889342 A thousand years this city has stood.
2889343 2892970 Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.
2892971 2895348 And the White Tree, the tree of the king...
2895349 2897058 ...will never bloom again.
2897059 2898934 <font color=#FF551>PIPPIN:</font> Why are they still guarding it?
2898935 2901145 <font color=#FF551>GANDALF:</font> They guard it because they have hope.
2901146 2903939 A faint and fading hope<br />that one day it will flower.
2903940 2908861 That a king will come and this<br />city will be as it once was...
2908862 2911947 ...before it fell into decay.
2911948 2915368 The old wisdom borne out<br />of the West was forsaken.
2915369 2919872 Kings made tombs more splendid<br />than the houses of the living...
2919873 2921957 ...and counted the old names of their descent...
2921958 2924919 ...dearer than the names of their sons.
2924920 2930132 Childless lords sat in aged<br />halls, musing on heraldry...
2930133 2935283 ...or in high, cold towers,<br />asking questions of the stars.
2935639 2940343 And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.
2940394 2943437 The line of kings failed.
2943438 2946524 The White Tree withered.
2946525 2951675 The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.
2961415 2963165 Mordor.
2963166 2967620 Yes,... there it lies.
2967671 2971415 This city has dwelt ever<br />in the sight of its shadow.
2971416 2973008 <font color=#ff00ff>[THUNDER ROLLING]</font>
2973009 2975344 A storm is coming.

2980809 2985146 A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.
2985147 2987773 The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...
2987774 2989775 ...so he covers the face of the sun...
2989776 2993696 ...to ease their passage along the road to war.
2993697 2997700 When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...
2997701 3000728 ...it will begin.
3001079 3003038 Well...
3003039 3005942 ...Minas Tirith...
3006293 3007835 ...very impressive.
3007836 3010671 - So where are we off to next?<br />- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.
3010672 3014767 There's no leaving this city.
3015218 3019340 Help must come to us.
3019931 3022766 <font color=#FF551>SAM:</font> It must be getting near teatime.
3022767 3026645 Leastways, it would be in decent<br />places where there is still teatime.
3026646 3031496 We're not in decent places.
3035780 3038625 Mr. Frodo?
3040076 3043096 What is it?
3043747 3046892 It's just a feeling.
3048543 3052093 I don't think I'll be coming back.
3055217 3058385 Yes, you will. Of course you will.
3058386 3060721 That's just morbid thinking.
3060722 3063349 We're going there and back again...
3063350 3066452 ...just like Mr. Bilbo.
3066603 3069453 You'll see.
3076905 3081455 <font color=#FF551>FRODO:</font> I think these lands were<br />once part of the kingdom of Gondor.
3084913 3090263 Long ago, when there was a king.
3109604 3113476 Mr. Frodo, look.
3114067 3117417 The king has got a crown again.
3127956 3133306 Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.

3149060 3153272 So I imagine this is just<br />a... ceremonial position.
3153273 3158323 I mean,... they don't actually<br />expect me to do any fighting.
3158361 3162080 - Do they?<br />- You're in the service of the steward now.
3162081 3165931 You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.
3169205 3172425 Ridiculous Hobbit.

3182969 3184595 <font color=#ff00ff>[GRUNTS]</font>
3184596 3187366 Thank you.
3195815 3198567 There's no more stars.
3198568 3200944 Is it time?
3200945 3203474 Yes.
3205325 3207993 It's so quiet.
3207994 3212744 It's the deep breath before the plunge.
3213416 3216977 I don't want to be in a battle...
3217128 3222778 ...but waiting on the edge of<br />one I can't escape is even worse.
3225637 3225849 Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
3230600 3233970 <font color=#FF551>GANDALF:</font> There never was much hope.
3235689 3238839 Just a fool's hope.
3243321 3246281 Our enemy is ready.
3246282 3249118 His full strength's gathered.

3264300 3267803 This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.
3267804 3272141 Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.
3272142 3276645 If the river is taken, if the<br />garrison at Osgiliath falls...
3276646 3280482 ...the last defense of this city will be gone.
3280483 3285833 But we have the White Wizard.<br />That's got to count for something.

3313266 3316310 You've met him before.
3316311 3320661 He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

3605850 3609000 I'm watching you.
3613191 3615358 What was that about?
3615359 3619509 Nothing. Just clearing something up.
3624410 3627454 Peregrin Took, my lad, there<br />is a task now to be done.
3627455 3633005 Another opportunity for one of the<br />Shire-folk to prove their great worth.
3636881 3640201 You must not fail me.
3672708 3675961 <font color=#FF551>MADRIL:</font> It's been very quiet across the river.
3675962 3678463 The Orcs are lying low.
3678464 3681591 The garrison may have moved out.
3681592 3684469 We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.

4505415 4509043 What you judged to be right.
4509044 4515894 You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor<br />in the hands of a witless Half ling.
4518887 4525037 It should have been brought back<br />to the Citadel to be kept safe.
4525352 4527311 Hidden.
4527312 4530231 Dark and deep in the vaults...
4530232 4533582 ...not to be used.
4536571 4541909 Unless at the uttermost end of need.
4541910 4544120 I would not use the Ring.
4544121 4547540 Not if Minas Tirith were falling<br />in ruin and I alone could save her.
4547541 4552545 Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...

4556591 4560761 Boromir would have remembered his father's need.
4560762 4566392 - He would have brought me a kingly gift.<br />- Boromir would not have brought the Ring.

4828863 4832032 I didn't think they would find<br />any livery that would fit me.
4832033 4834660 Once belonged to a young boy of the city.
4834661 4836370 A very foolish one...

4840792 4843711 - This was yours?<br />- Yes, it was mine.
4843712 4846547 My father had it made for me.

10926272 10928816 I thought I'd lost you.
10928817 10931694 So I took it.
10931695 10935072 Only for safekeeping.

10991004 10997354 You can't go walking through<br />Mordor in naught but your skin.

11018448 11022076 We made it to Mordor.

11024746 11029096 We'll never get through unseen.
11032420 11036970 It's him, the Eye.
11043473 11046600 We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.
11046601 11050341 There's nothing for it.
11051606 11057956 Come on. Let's just make it<br />down the hill for starters.
11065411 11069957 Frodo has passed beyond my sight.
11069958 11072960 The darkness is deepening.
11072961 11075504 If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.
11075505 11079091 It's only a matter of time.
11079092 11082511 He has suffered a defeat, yes, But...
11082512 11087224 ...behind the walls of Mordor,<br />our enemy is regrouping.
11087225 11089226 Let him stay there.
11089227 11092020 Let him rot! Why should we care?
11092021 11098971 Because 10,000 Orcs now stand<br />between Frodo and Mount Doom.
11103992 11107595 I've sent him to his death.
11108246 11110539 No.
11110540 11112541 There is still hope for Frodo.
11112542 11117796 He needs time and safe passage<br />across the plains of Gorgoroth.
11117797 11120674 - We can give him that.<br />- How?
11120675 11123552 Draw out Sauron's armies.
11123553 11125888 Empty his lands.
11125889 11129183 Then we gather our full strength<br />and march on the Black Gate.

11134564 11141314 But we can give Frodo his chance if<br />we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.
11141988 11146533 Keep him blind to all else that moves.
11146534 11147868 A diversion.
11147869 11149870 Certainty of death...

11153499 11155667 ...what are we waiting for?
11155668 11158879 Sauron will suspect a trap.
