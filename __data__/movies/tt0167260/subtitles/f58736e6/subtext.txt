5756 7756 Hi, this is Peter Jackson, the director.
9843 11193 Hi, I'm Fran Walsh, writer.
12262 13388 Hi, I'm Philippa Boyens,<br />one of the other writers.
13472 16224 And this is the director's and<br />writers' commentary, I guess, isn't it?
16308 17768 -The final.<br />-Final one.
17935 20103 Four hours and 10 minutes long,<br />this movie is.
20187 21646 Is that...?<br />That's without the credits, isn't it?
21730 22563 Yeah.
23649 24699 There will be a test.
26443 32198 So the credits are pretty much the same<br />as they have been on the previous films.
32282 34159 In fact, I think this is<br />the <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i> title
34243 37538 that we've just rehashed twice before,<br />which is good.
37704 42251 It's a very cost-effective way to make<br />films, to use the same title three times.
44127 46171 This scene was directed by Fran.
46338 47673 -Yeah.<br />-We had a choice.
47839 49257 We could have opened on a wide shot<br />of the river
49341 51551 we could have opened<br />on a fishing line going into the water.
51635 54054 But that shot that you guys did<br />of the worm
54221 56181 that pulls focus to Andy's face
56348 59893 I just think that's a great way<br />to open the movie, on a wriggling worm.
59977 63827 -I really liked that as a start.<br />-Well, that's actually a literary allusion...
64022 66191 Worms, apples, the fall.
66358 67651 -The fall?<br />-Gardens.
67818 69486 She's lying.
70153 71572 He believed me.
76660 77911 ...in a film we did<br />called <i>Forgotten Silver.</i>
77995 80895 We asked Tom if he'd like to just do<br />this very small cameo.
81039 82958 This sequence was shot at Fernside.
83125 85460 It stood in for a river,<br />but it's actually not a river.
85544 88296 It's a very small lake, which is useful<br />for when you're making a film.
88380 89631 You know, you're not in danger
89715 92300 of boats and crew members<br />floating off down the river.
92384 94884 Andy wasn't originally<br />going to be Sméagol, was he?
95095 98195 We sort of cast Andy for the voice<br />way back at the beginning…
100392 101601 And we had ideas for other actors,<br />didn't we, for Sméagol?
101685 104312 Sort of it's amazing, because it seems<br />so obvious now, doesn't it?
104396 107149 It took us a while to get to the point<br />where we thought:
107316 110027 "Well, obviously we should have Andy."
110193 113393 This sequence always felt<br />like a good place to start the movie...
115449 118701 And if you start with that and you end<br />with it going into the Crack of Doom
118785 121246 it had a kind of nice unity to it.
126793 127961 Because <i>The Two Towers</i><br />was about other things,
128045 129629 -but not really about the Ring.<br />-Yeah.
129713 132715 And yet, this movie, we had<br />to bring the Ring right back up
132799 134759 into the forefront of the story again.<br />And so...
134843 137428 How were we gonna start<br /><i>Return of the King</i> if it wasn't...?
137512 139597 Because this was supposed to be<br />in <i>The Two Towers.</i>
139681 141431 We actually shot one idea we had,
142225 145325 -and it was always a placeholder.<br />-That's right, I remember.
148440 148815 We go rushing across<br />the plains of Edoras.
148982 150900 I remember we did a sped-up<br />helicopter shot,
150984 154584 and we crash into the Golden Hall,<br />and he wakes up out of a nightmare.
154738 156823 And that was actually supposed to be<br />the beginning, wasn't it?
156907 158866 -Yes, it was.<br />-And what it ended up happening is
158950 161202 we inherited two scenes<br />from <i>The Two Towers.</i>
161286 164038 If you remember in <i>The Two Towers,</i><br />in the Dead Marshes
164122 166374 there's a scene where Frodo<br />goes over to Gollum
166458 170169 he calls him Sméagol, and Gollum goes<br />into this slight reverie, this moment.
170253 172303 And that was the queue for the flashback.
172464 175383 And for length reasons we didn't put it<br />in the theatrical of <i>The Two Towers.</i>
175467 177969 And then we thought, by the time we were<br />cutting the extended edition
178053 181056 of <i>The Two Towers,</i><br />we had got the idea at that stage
181223 183725 to maybe save it for... For this movie.
184101 187020 We had done the big James Bond<br />kind of pre-credit sequence thing
187104 189606 on <i>The Two Towers</i> with the big fight,<br />and I didn't wanna
189690 193359 have to sit and dream up another big<br />slam-bang action scene for this film
193443 195570 because it felt like<br />we had been falling into a pattern
195654 198073 -a franchise pattern, as it were.<br />-Yeah.
198240 200491 When we realized that we had<br />available to us
200575 202244 this Sméagol-Déagol scene
202411 205204 it seemed like a counter<br />to how <i>The Two Towers</i> opened.
205288 207248 Because I know that Andy<br />was really disappointed
207332 210460 that it was cut out of <i>The Two Towers,</i><br />because he... You know, he was aware
210544 213880 it was his... It was his moment<br />to have his real face seen on-screen.
213964 217216 And then we cut it... We cut him out, and<br />I think he was never quite believing
217300 219719 that we were gonna...<br />Actually gonna use the scene at all.
219803 221304 Probably not.
223348 224974 I didn't shoot any of this scene.
225058 228061 I was busy on another set,<br />and we had no other directors.
228228 231878 And so we said to Andy, "Listen,<br />do you mind if you direct yourself today?
232023 234818 Because there's no one else<br />that we can find to do it."
235318 237468 Yeah, I love the sound design<br />in this scene.
240490 242909 ...and just let the kind of intensity<br />of the moment really take over.
242993 247706 And at one point we cut the effects back,<br />and it wasn't half as scary.
253837 254712 ...because, remember, the MPAA<br />asked us to reduce the intensity...
254796 256673 ...and we shortened one<br />of the strangling shots...
256757 258675 ...and then we put it back<br />at its original length here.
258759 262679 So this is the complete, full<br />strangulation, never seen before
262846 265307 here exclusively on DVD.
267517 271855 In this shot here, old Tom,<br />who is trying his hardest to be dead
272022 273773 actually blinked right in the middle<br />of the shot.
273857 276442 But Andy's performance was so great<br />in this particular take
276526 278444 that we wanted to use the blinking one,
278528 283116 so we had Weta...<br />The CG guys at Weta freeze his eyes.
283283 285535 So we removed the blink from his eyes.
298215 300165 This was a sequence that Fran directed.
300300 303302 We built the set very quickly,<br />because it was an idea that you had
303386 306347 that wasn't really part of the script,<br />to show this deterioration,
306431 310936 and we put a guerrilla crew together<br />so that you could film it with Andy.
311102 313752 We were trying to figure out<br />all the different ways…
316566 316900 We could use this set, which<br />was really a little gully, a rock gully.
317067 320904 So we drowned it in rain, we<br />dried it out and drowned it in lights
321071 323240 -threw some greenery in.<br />-Yeah.
323406 327410 We just tried to give it variation.<br />And also to show, obviously
327577 328829 passage of time.
328995 332123 -That was a huge makeup, wasn't it?<br />-It was enormous.
332207 334084 He was in there for how long?
334251 336502 -I couldn't tell you.<br />-Hours and hours and hours.
336586 337838 Forever.
339339 343191 I love this stuff here with the fish.
345262 347764 Weren't Andy's legs too muscular,<br />though, Pete? Did you guys...?
347848 351198 Yeah, the shot of him on the rocks<br />before he goes in the cave, we...
352936 354562 He had these very chunky, muscly legs.
354646 358608 And so we had the CG department<br />thin them down on the computer
358775 360276 to make them look more emaciated.
360360 362863 And this shot here<br />he has an eye enlargement
363029 366157 where we used the computer to...<br />To make his eyes bigger,
366324 369118 so that he would start to look<br />a little bit more like Gollum.
369202 373790 We also morphed some<br />of the CG Gollum's face with Andy's.
373957 377126 We kind of mixed the two faces together,<br />because we wanted him to look
377210 380463 like he was almost on the verge<br />of becoming the full version of Gollum
380547 381548 the CG creature.
381715 385065 We wanted to get a little bit more<br />of that feeling into Andy's face.
387554 391391 This was a sequence that was shot<br />on a day that it snowed.
391558 395478 Now, you don't see the snow here,<br />but we were in a place called Ruapehu
395645 396855 which is a volcano.
397022 398815 And it was late summer,
398982 400775 and it was absolutely not<br />supposed to snow.
400859 404403 But it was one of our days that...<br />We had several during our lengthy shoot
404487 406387 where there was unseasonal weather.
406531 410327 And it was like, "Oh, it's the first time<br />it's snowed here for 65 years."
410493 412328 It was like. "Oh, yeah,<br />sure. Well, great."
412412 414962 I remember you were standing<br />out in the middle of...
417792 418084 You know, the snow was sort of raining<br />down on everybody, and you were saying:
418251 420351 "Snow? This isn't snow,<br />it's volcanic ash."
420503 423506 -Yeah, that's true.<br />-I was trying to be optimistic.
427469 430369 And this was a big culvert,<br />this was a set that we built…
432891 434767 And you're looking at shots here<br />that were done in the year 2000.
434851 438188 And then we had Elijah and Sean<br />come back to do some close-ups.
438355 440857 Now, when you look at them<br />when they're... They're talking,
440941 442859 and they're just...<br />The wall of the culvert behind them.
442943 445695 There's four years between<br />some of these shots.
454788 456538 That's original, that shot there,
457916 459500 but the reason we did the pickups was...
459584 463546 One of the reasons was we wanted to<br />set up Sam's belief in the journey home,
463713 467258 and the possibility of a journey home<br />that we were going to take away from him
467342 470928 on the slopes of Mount Doom, to<br />help reinforce the water-bottle scene
471012 472805 which was one of the reasons of...<br />For the pickups.
472889 476601 And we also felt we hadn't really<br />established the lembas bread properly,
476768 478102 and the importance of it.
478186 480536 Well, we'd established it<br />in the previous movie.
483441 485234 Because the lembas, obviously,<br />is a catalyst for turning Sam and Frodo
485318 488571 against each other.<br />So we wanted to re-establish it.
490281 494577 The lembas bread was just a bit of bloody<br />old pastry that wasn't really tasty.
494744 496371 -Not really.<br />-Did you try it?
496538 498039 A little peckish, just that...
498206 499999 Just when you're waiting<br />for the lunch break to happen,
500083 502001 and you look around and see<br />if there's any nibbles,
502085 504420 and the craft services table<br />is a bit far away,
504504 507214 but there's always the lembas bread<br />lying there in the prop department.
507298 509050 -Pete, that's desperate.<br />-Yeah, I know. That's where...
509134 511719 That's where it all went when<br />the props people were complaining
511803 513512 that somebody was stealing it. It was me.
513596 514946 It wasn't Gollum after all.
515265 516615 It wasn't Gollum after all.
522897 526097 ...these close-ups were done<br />four years after the original shots.
533324 535785 We were lucky here,<br />because this landscape
535952 539622 on the slopes of Ruapehu.<br />Actually had a fire, a forest fire.
539789 542500 About six months before<br />we were due to shoot there
542667 544794 it had all been burnt through<br />with a blaze.
544878 549466 And so we had this great landscape that<br />was sort of ashy and volcanic-looking.
549632 552301 But it was actually the result of a fire<br />that had swept through,
552385 554137 and killed all the undergrowth.
554304 557974 It's a great location for a World War<br />I film, burnt trees and scorched land.
558058 560143 And yeah. Yeah.
562771 565064 I always thought this was a dodgy scene,<br />because we shot it
565148 568359 in our Fangorn set in the studio,<br />which was a tiny studio,
568526 572864 and you can basically look<br />at a painted cyclorama in the background.
574949 578495 And it's one of the reasons<br />why we shot it so much out of focus
578661 582111 is to try to disguise the fact<br />that it was just a painted backdrop.
584584 586419 And that shot there, in particular.
592008 595511 This is a big miniature that was shot<br />out in the back of the parking lot.
595595 597513 That circle of Isengard with the tower.
597597 600891 I mean, the tower itself was about<br />14 feet tall, and the circle was
600975 603186 I don't know, 50 feet in diameter.
605021 606397 This was a fun scene.
606564 608941 We actually ended up picking<br />quite conservative takes
609025 611777 because they shot five or six takes<br />of this particular sequence,
611861 614781 and Billy and Dom<br />gave us a lot of variations
614948 617116 in just how stoned they were,<br />and there were some
617200 619827 actually quite funny ones<br />where they were incredibly stoned.
619911 624040 And I ended up using ones<br />that were a little bit more conservative.
624207 626626 But there are some very funny outtakes.
626918 629168 This plays particularly well<br />if you've seen…
632215 634115 And seen them find Saruman's hoard.
634259 637309 All shot in a tiny little studio,<br />and we used a blue screen…
639889 640431 Behind Billy and Dom, but<br />we just had this little bit of trees,
640598 644561 and piece of the wall, and it was<br />very cramped and very claustrophobic,
644727 648977 and we're sort of lucky that, in the movie,<br />people don't think about that too much.
650150 652526 That's why I, you know...<br />We used those big miniature shots
652610 655572 to try to bust it open a bit,<br />to give a sense of scale
655738 658616 when no scale actually exists.
662912 667542 The whole Isengard sequence<br />was supposed to be at the end
667709 671713 of <i>Two Towers,</i> and it... We just felt<br />that by the time we got through
671880 675007 the battle of Helm's Deep, that<br />that film really needed to wind down,
675091 676759 and be over and done with,
676926 679804 and, you know, if you were returning to<br />Isengard at the end of <i>The Two Towers,</i>
679888 681847 and you obviously had to have<br />the scene in its entirety
681931 683599 which was upwards of 10 minutes long...
683683 688354 And it was just a very anticlimactic way<br />to end that movie
688521 690356 after you've had this huge battle.
690440 692358 -And so I think we did the right thing...<br />-Yeah.
692442 693984 ...in relationship to <i>The Two Towers...</i>
694068 695694 ...because we were<br />looking after that film last year...
695778 697863 ...and that was where our attention<br />and focus was...
697947 701347 ...and then this year we had<br />what we ultimately felt was a problem...
701451 706080 ...because we had to have the scene,<br />because of the palantír.
706247 709292 That was really the main reason<br />why our characters
709459 712920 had to go back to Isengard.<br />It wasn't to deal to Saruman, we felt,
713004 715506 and that's obviously why Saruman was<br />deleted out of the theatrical version
715590 718634 of <i>The Return of the King,</i> generally,<br />because we felt it was about Sauron
718718 720219 as the villain of this film.
720303 723681 And when we were thinking about<br />the opening, and the overall length
723765 725391 of <i>Return of the King,</i><br />this was a sequence
725475 728894 we were just always worried about,<br />and for a long time the thinking was:
728978 731772 "Well, is there a way that we don't<br />have them return to Isengard?
731856 734734 Can they pick up the palantír<br />somewhere else?"
735318 738654 And then we couldn't figure out a way<br />to do that, and so then the idea came:
738738 741365 "Well, they could go to Isengard,<br />but they don't encounter Saruman."
741449 745161 Which was the second plan. And that<br />was a tough decision to make, obviously
745245 747955 from the point of view<br />of not having Christopher in the film,
748039 749290 but still having Isengard.
749374 751709 It was easier, in a way,<br />if we just didn't go to Isengard at all
751793 753752 we wouldn't have actually had<br />to face that problem.
753836 758086 But we ended up just doing what we could<br />to push the theatrical version of the film
758174 759634 along at a speedy pace.
759801 762901 It is very much going backwards<br />in terms of the storytelling...
765223 770103 It needed to be providing fresh information,<br />it needed to be moving the story onward.
770270 772605 So we attempted to do that<br />within the pickups.
772772 775983 Really what we were trying to do<br />was pin the tension on the possibility
776067 779904 that Saruman knows something<br />that Gandalf needs to know.
780071 783950 That thing that he knew was Denethor,<br />and that Denethor
784117 787870 was a grave danger to Minas Tirith,<br />and that Minas Tirith would fall,
788037 790832 and that he knows exactly<br />what Sauron's plans were.
790999 792791 But in the greater scheme of things,<br />that was just us
792875 798339 desperately trying to make a scene work<br />that really was still going backwards,
798506 801175 and wasn't really driving<br />the story forward.
807765 808974 It was very windy that day.
809058 812658 It was very windy, and the wind<br />kind of dictated the look of the scene…
814731 817399 His hair was blowing into his mouth<br />while he was talking,
817483 819026 and his beard and robes<br />were blowing around.
819110 823197 But I kind of like the look of it.<br />It has an organic kind of reality to it.
823364 826325 And it was interesting, because<br />the original shooting of that scene
826409 830163 back in 2000, was done with the wind<br />and the look and the feel
830330 833958 then when we wrote some extra lines<br />for him to do last year
834125 839422 we did those pickups three years after the<br />original shoot, in... In a studio this time.
839589 842589 We went out in the parking lot,<br />so we had enormous trouble
842675 844218 getting all of these wind machines.
844302 847347 And then we had to blow his hair<br />to the same degree
847513 848681 because it had to match perfectly.
848765 851684 And so Christopher was now in the studio<br />delivering lines
851768 853978 battling against this enormous<br />wind machine
854062 855912 that we had blowing into his face.
857231 860025 This sequence was shot on the<br />wet set that... We call it the wet set
860109 861903 because it's wet, I guess.
862070 865156 It has water, but it's basically<br />a pile of sandbags
865323 867741 shaped like a big swimming pool,<br />and it was on a parking lot,
867825 870744 so we were standing on the asphalt<br />of a parking lot. We flooded it.
870828 874123 This was where we shot the outside<br />of the Mines of Moria, with that lake
874207 876834 where the monster attacks them<br />outside the entrance of the mine.
876918 879503 And we used it for the Dead Marshes<br />in <i>The Two Towers,</i>
879587 882215 and it also served as flooded Isengard.
882382 884882 So it was a really worthwhile<br />sort of set to build.
885885 889485 Some of the great lines that we struggled<br />so hard to keep in the movie
891307 894518 because they're so Tolkienesque and<br />delivered so brilliantly by the actors
894602 898689 and... "What is the house of Rohan but a<br />thatched barn?" All of that sort of thing.
898773 901442 Just wanna keep that incredible language,
901609 906948 but, really, unless it works dramatically<br />in the end, it's hard to justify.
907115 909865 I think you can feel it, though.<br />In the seven minutes
911702 911786 of watching this scene,<br />that it lacks of the dramatic shape.
911953 912954 I can feel it.
913121 915921 It's only because, to me,<br />if we had written this scene…
918167 919376 As the beginning of the movie,<br />and Peter had been able to shoot it
919460 922296 knowing this was going to kick off<br /><i>The Return of the King</i>
922380 924256 we would have done...<br />Made so many different choices.
924340 927540 It's... It's okay being in the<br />Extended Cut, because in a sense…
929595 931138 The existence of the Extended Cut<br />completes what's effectively a box set.
931222 933640 It's three movies. The end of one film<br />and the beginning of the next
933724 934974 becomes less relevant.
935059 937895 You haven't got a... A year gap between<br />the release of these films anymore.
937979 941023 You've now got them sitting<br />on your shelf as one complete set.
941107 943275 The placement of these scenes is...<br />Is actually less important
943359 945277 now that the whole thing's together<br />in one set.
945361 948489 But certainly, when we were looking<br />at these films being a year apart,
948573 951033 and what was in... What was last year<br />and what's this year
951117 953017 there were tough decisions to make.
957206 959625 Of course, Saruman's death<br />is also a variation,
959792 961842 and we wanted to acknowledge that here.
962003 965715 We... Even though we were resetting<br />what happens in the Shire to Isengard
965882 968092 in terms of changing the book,<br />we wanted to somehow
968176 969844 have the dynamic the same.
971471 975766 When I was shooting the stabbing shot<br />with Christopher, as a director would
975933 979603 I was explaining to him what he should<br />do when Wormtongue stabs him in the back
979687 981605 like sort of the air<br />is escaping out of you.
981689 985485 And he says, "Peter, have you ever heard<br />the sound a man makes
985651 988779 when he's stabbed in the back?"<br />And I said, "No."
988946 991949 And he says, "Well, I have.<br />I know what to do."
992116 994868 And, of course, when you question him<br />for more information
994952 997663 you find out that he's still under<br />the Official information Act
997747 1000582 the Secrecy Act, because he was<br />a commander in World War II.
1000666 1003293 And there were things happened with<br />Christopher that he's never talked about,
1003377 1004837 and he's not allowed to talk about.
1004921 1008591 He knew the sound of the air escaping<br />and the groan
1008758 1011219 the type of groan that is emitted.
1011761 1015765 And that's what you're actually getting<br />in this film, the authentic re-creation.
1021354 1023522 You know, the great thing with DVD<br />is then Christopher wasn't in the film...
1023606 1025691 You know, the great thing with DVD<br />is then Christopher wasn't in the film,
1025775 1029654 for a few months,<br />and now with the release of this DVD
1029820 1030904 he's back in there again,
1030988 1034199 and, I mean, these will be ultimately seen<br />as the more definitive versions of the film
1034283 1035785 I'm sure.
1039372 1041540 We do have an alternative version<br />of this scene.
1041624 1043542 We have stuff in this scene<br />that we still haven't used.
1043626 1046076 Again, it was about giving the scene<br />some tension.
1049465 1052634 ...of revealing the truth behind the death<br />of Théodred to Théoden.
1052718 1056513 This is when the whole sequence was...<br />That was your idea, wasn't it, Franny?
1056597 1060393 When the sequence was closing out<br />Film Two, and we wanted it
1060560 1063896 to have some of that tension<br />and drama of a final denouement.
1064063 1067275 But the problem with that<br />was that that never really worked
1067441 1072113 because we didn't ultimately care<br />about Théodred,
1072280 1074907 or need to know who...<br />Who or what had killed him.
1075074 1077826 And by that stage we had been away<br />from Gríma too much
1077910 1080060 to really care too much about him either.
1085251 1088295 Mind you, by then, I'll be so<br />old that I will have forgotten
1088379 1092079 that we ever shot these movies,<br />and have no idea what we have left over.
1095011 1096220 -...the scouring of the Shire, wasn't it?<br />-Yes.
1096304 1097680 -Sharkey and...<br />-Yes.
1097847 1101497 -...the Hobbits encountering him.<br />-The... This was the basis of the scene.
1108941 1111941 This was a shot that was<br />one of the star shots in the reel...
1114363 1115663 Well, we ran it backwards.
1115823 1117115 We did, actually, it's back... Yeah.
1117199 1119576 And we had to paint out the soldiers<br />walking backwards.
1119660 1120911 That's right.
1121078 1123378 Because the original shot pulls out.<br />Didn't it?
1126375 1127209 ...where it was,<br />we thought it had to push in...
1127293 1129545 -...otherwise it wasn't really working.<br />-To take you into the whole...
1129629 1132129 -Yeah, yeah.<br />-She was watching them leave in One,
1134091 1134967 and then watching them arrive<br />in this film.
1135051 1138201 This was actually a rebuilt Edoras,<br />because this entire party…
1140473 1143973 Didn't actually exist in our<br />original script and we'd never shot it.
1144101 1147312 And we had this giant, big set<br />of this Golden Hall that we had built.
1147396 1149022 Fortunately, when we were done<br />with shooting
1149106 1151984 we put it in storage, just in case.
1152151 1155529 We didn't throw it away, which was lucky,<br />because three years later
1155613 1157698 we kind of came up with the idea<br />of this banquet,
1157782 1159533 and we were able to drag<br />this bloody big set out,
1159617 1163579 and stick it in the warehouse again,<br />and we had it back for filming.
1163746 1167146 The drinking game was meant to be<br />a bit of leaven, really, wasn't it?
1169043 1170419 Just to lighten the front of this film.<br />That it's not all doom and gloom.
1170503 1172504 And Pete came up with the idea<br />of a drinking game.
1172588 1175738 Yeah. Drinking competitions<br />are a national sport in New Zealand.
1177718 1178135 I mean, if New Zealand was running<br />the Olympic Games
1178302 1179886 it would be one of the main events.
1179970 1183370 It was primarily an excuse<br />for putting Howard and Michael Semanick
1184266 1185866 in the back of shot. I think.
1189647 1192065 ...is next to Howard Shore,<br />and we put wigs on them...
1192149 1194693 ...we put them in there,<br />we made them sit around for hours...
1194777 1197029 ...we shot them,<br />and then we cut them out of the film.
1197113 1202284 So it was a very sort of typical<br />experience as a movie extra.
1202451 1204453 They hit the cutting-room floor.
1204620 1206320 Yes, anyway, everybody's back now.
1206414 1208916 Everyone's got their cameos back<br />in this DVD.
1212044 1215464 The banquet sequence is really a series of<br />setups, isn't it, for... For later things?
1215548 1218717 The only thing that isn't a setup<br />was the frivolous drinking game.
1218801 1222722 When the old, tough choices came<br />about what to include in the movie
1222888 1225140 that was the piece of the scene<br />that was expendable
1225224 1227768 in the sense of the narrative, because<br />we wanted to obviously establish
1227852 1229895 the relationship<br />between Éowyn and Aragorn.
1229979 1234191 We wanted to hint at Théoden's<br />lack of confidence about his abilities.
1234358 1237445 We wanted to establish<br />even the little glimpse
1237611 1240656 of Pippin being distracted<br />by the palantír,
1240823 1242407 and Gandalf thinking that<br />something might be up.
1242491 1244993 And we wanted to obviously have Gandalf<br />and Aragorn having the conversation
1245077 1246620 about Frodo and what's happened to him.
1246704 1249915 So we were able to establish<br />a whole lot of little story threads
1249999 1254837 in one sequence,<br />that we had already shot the later
1255337 1257589 you know, the later stages<br />of those story lines.
1257673 1261635 But we... We hadn't really felt<br />that we'd begun them that... That cleanly.
1261802 1264302 Actually, what we were doing, too,<br />was trying to…
1267057 1268141 Earn another scene that was not put<br />in the original
1268225 1270575 which is the scene between<br />Éowyn and Aragorn.
1277193 1278943 John just went kind of crazy there.
1282656 1285867 And that line, God knows where...<br />What that line... Where it came from or...
1285951 1288328 Oh, I can tell you. You don't wanna<br />know where it comes from.
1288412 1290039 -Tell me.<br />-It comes from <i>Jaws,</i>
1290206 1292750 and it comes from<br />Captain Quinton, who says:
1292917 1295711 "Here's to men who go swimming<br />with bow-legged women."
1295878 1297878 Oh, okay. Oh, that's where it came from.
1298339 1300339 Oh, okay. Oh, that's where it came from.
1301383 1303933 In drinking scenes in movies,<br />people often wonder…
1306722 1309307 Because it... Otherwise you'd have<br />actors rolling around on the floor.
1309391 1311476 And sometimes you do have actors<br />rolling around on the floor anyway.
1311560 1313771 In the movies we use a low-alcohol beer.
1313938 1317441 It's real beer, it's brewed with hops<br />and it tastes pretty much like beer,
1317525 1318817 but it's very low-alcohol.
1318901 1321904 We had a brewery in Nelson<br />actually create
1322071 1325366 a special low-alcohol Hobbit beer<br />for us to use in the film.
1329995 1332206 So where did that drinking song<br />come from?
1332373 1333206 Phil wrote it.
1339922 1340256 Full credit for the bad stuff!<br />I always write the drinking songs.
1340422 1342716 And Plan 9 did the music.
1345636 1348436 Hopefully people aren't concentrating.<br />But if you look…
1351016 1351267 At this very quiet conversation<br />between these two characters
1351433 1354436 you find out that... You'll hear<br />that the... The sound of the party
1354520 1356230 has suddenly died right down.
1356397 1360025 And it's one of those weird things that...<br />That happens when you're mixing the film
1360109 1362945 that you can have this loud.<br />Outrageous party
1363112 1366740 with everybody laughing and drinking,<br />and food and every... All the noises,
1366824 1368867 and then when you have<br />this quiet conversation
1368951 1371536 you obviously just can't play<br />those sorts of sounds.
1371620 1375040 And so you just push it all back, and<br />it... And it's sort of very artificial,
1375124 1377083 but there's no... No other way around it.
1377167 1381117 And you just hope that in the flow of<br />the film, people aren't thinking about it.
1386010 1390848 This sequence is like a sister<br />to the scene in <i>The Two Towers</i>
1391015 1392474 where Gollum talks to himself.
1392558 1394643 The irony is that this one was shot first.
1394727 1398230 It was shot during our principal photography<br />and it was shot for <i>Return of the King</i>
1398314 1401274 actually directed by Geoff Murphy.<br />And you were there too, weren't you. Fran?
1401358 1403652 -Yeah.<br />-And we'd liked the scene a lot,
1403819 1406238 but when... In <i>The Two Towers</i><br />we thought we needed
1406322 1408240 an equivalent scene<br />that did a very similar thing.
1408324 1411118 So it... The scene in<br /><i>The Two Towers</i> was something
1411285 1414788 that Fran wrote and directed<br />as a setup for what would ultimately...
1414955 1419418 This was like the second beat in that...<br />In that... In his deterioration, wasn't it?
1419585 1422885 Yeah, although we did have two...<br />The two monologues in <i>Two Towers.</i>
1425007 1425174 We had the... The one right at the end
1425341 1427300 -the two-minute, you know, shot.<br />-Yeah, in the forest?
1427384 1428385 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
1428552 1430602 -So this was really the third one.<br />-Right.
1435434 1437561 ...one of the very first sort of splittings<br />of the two characters originally...
1437645 1439396 ...which, of course,<br />would have come too late...
1439480 1442691 ...as we realized when we were doing<br />pickups on <i>Two Towers.</i>
1443692 1446945 But I have always loved the conceit<br />that you came up with, Pete, didn't you
1447029 1451700 when you, when we... At the very beginning,<br />of the... The image in the water.
1451867 1455267 Yeah, it's a little bit clichéd,<br />and it's a little bit unimaginative.
1457373 1458832 ...where you have somebody just cutting<br />from different camera angles.
1458916 1463545 Having the old reflection talking to<br />yourself has been done before, hasn't it?
1468884 1472471 It's worth just mentioning, too,<br />that this is an improved Gollum
1472638 1475849 over the one that was in<br /><i>Two Towers.</i> That between <i>The Two...</i>
1476016 1479269 After <i>Two Towers</i> was finished,<br />the Weta CG artist
1479436 1482522 did a lot of work on his face, and they<br />re-engineered some of the muscles,
1482606 1485650 and allowed him to actually pull<br />more subtle expressions
1485734 1487152 especially around his eyes,
1487236 1490322 and I think that Gollum's performance<br />in <i>Return of the King</i>
1490406 1494200 is actually better than <i>The Two Towers,</i><br />just because they were able to capture
1494284 1497663 what Andy was doing<br />with much more accuracy.
1501458 1505337 Well, we didn't really want to make this<br />just a... A copy of what people had seen
1505421 1507881 in <i>The Two Towers</i> earlier.<br />But I... I think it's nice
1507965 1511260 because it has a few<br />little interesting twists on it.
1511427 1516056 It really does play up the... The argument<br />between himself, doesn't it?
1516223 1521645 It's like in... Gollum warning Sméagol not<br />to get too excited. And it's kind of fun.
1528902 1532152 We worked a lot of this dialogue<br />up on the motion-capture stage...
1533782 1537232 Right, so it wasn't actually even there<br />on the day that you shot it...
1539079 1542124 -And Gollum was put in much later.<br />-Yes.
1545669 1548380 I mean, one of the things we had to be<br />a bit careful of in... In this film
1548464 1553719 was that the, you know, the relationship<br />between Sméagol and Frodo and Sam
1553886 1557722 can get one-note very quickly, kind of...<br />That you've basically got Sam saying:
1557806 1560517 "But he's out to kill us, he's<br />out to kill us." and Frodo saying:
1560601 1563395 "But he has to show us the way,"<br />and Gollum doing his own thing.
1563479 1565438 And we were sort of worried<br />that we were just gonna end up
1565522 1569818 with too many scenes that were<br />basically playing that same story beat.
1569985 1571485 -Well, we did, actually.<br />-Yeah.
1575157 1578618 In terms of... And that's why, I think, the<br />foot of the stairs didn't go in, did it,
1578702 1580454 -for that reason?<br />-No.
1580621 1582664 Well, it's in the Extended Cut.
1585125 1589004 That Sméagol is a little bit more devious<br />than even Gollum understands or knows.
1589088 1591888 Sméagol wasn't the... The simpleton<br />that he comes across.
1594551 1597721 He had his own little agenda to even<br />try to outsmart his own... His alter ego.
1597805 1601600 Yeah. This is a kind of nice idea<br />to build that complexity into it.
1606814 1606855 "Sméagol promised. Sméagol lied."
1607022 1609733 -Oh, yeah.<br />-That actually he was
1609900 1612152 a pretty dark character<br />and wasn't the cute character
1612236 1614613 that everyone had fallen in love with.
1614780 1618130 I love the look that Gollum gives here.<br />It's a beautiful expression.
1620202 1623496 I love the look that Gollum gives here.<br />It's a beautiful expression.
1623580 1628836 Really, the villainy of <i>Return of the King</i><br />commences with Pippin
1629002 1633340 having his encounter with the palantír<br />in the Edoras sleeping quarters.
1633507 1636157 That, you know...<br />That's Sauron's emergence of this...
1636260 1638178 In this film as the villain.
1638345 1643892 And we felt, that's really where the<br />force of evil starts in... In this film.
1647104 1649954 The film was gonna start<br />with the camera rushing across
1650065 1652317 from the Paths of the Dead<br />and crashing into Aragorn
1652401 1653902 who wakes up out of a nightmare.
1653986 1658115 And then he steps out of the room,<br />and this is literally
1658282 1662411 the first sort of scene in the movie,<br />how it was gonna open.
1662578 1665330 Of course, the irony was, was that<br />it didn't end up in the movie at all.
1665414 1668333 -Yeah.<br />-But it's a beautiful scene.
1671587 1673937 This is about a woman<br />who has never been able...
1677050 1679094 And that her powerlessness that<br />she actually sees, stood on the brink,
1679178 1682264 but she was powerless<br />to do something, and she's looking...
1682431 1684474 What I like about what Miranda<br />does in here
1684558 1687227 is she's looking to him for an answer.
1687394 1689646 But actually, he can't give it to her.
1693692 1696942 -It was a real dream, wasn't it, of Tolkien's?<br />-Yes, that's right.
1699114 1700532 Yes, and that's where his idea<br />for Númenor came from.
1700616 1701867 That's right.
1702034 1703952 -Being consumed by the sea.<br />-That's right.
1704036 1706997 -Yeah. Like an Atlantis dream.<br />-It was.
1707164 1709291 -It's from her.<br />-The dream?
1709458 1710708 No, it's Faramir's dream.
1714963 1717298 In fact, he thought Faramir<br />may in fact have been himself
1717382 1718758 when he entered into the story.
1718842 1721928 And one of the things he gave to Faramir<br />was his dream of Númenor.
1722012 1725431 I... I'm not a dream person, but to me<br />it means a sense of powerlessness.
1725515 1727600 And certainly, looking at his childhood<br />you can understand
1727684 1729603 where that would have come from.
1730729 1735484 Always, we wanted to establish<br />the intimacy between Aragorn and Éowyn.
1735651 1738153 And you don't have much time<br />in the film to do it.
1738320 1740697 We wanted to build to the moment<br />where she takes
1740781 1744493 her own destiny in her hands<br />and says, "I'm going to fight."
1745202 1748452 The little moment that happens here<br />between Legolas and Aragorn…
1750582 1753794 Where it was a pickup,<br />but we didn't have Viggo and Orlando
1753961 1755921 in the country at the same time.
1757631 1760842 Orlando was shot first with nobody,<br />and then Viggo was shot
1761009 1764304 against a blue screen and superimposed<br />over the top of the shot.
1764388 1767265 So when they're looking at each other there.<br />They're just looking at marks on the wall.
1767349 1770060 They were shot about<br />three or four months apart.
1775023 1775973 -...in the sky.<br />-Oh.
1779486 1779528 Well, maybe some stars are veiled.<br />The ones that really count.
1779695 1781595 It might not have been a literal line.
1783865 1784199 -Are you saying it's...?<br />-Did that not occur to you, that we write...
1784366 1786075 -No.<br />-...figuratively as well as literally?
1786159 1789246 So you think, metaphorically,<br />the stars are veiled.
1791415 1795615 There was a tiny reference that Tolkien<br />did to Gandalf sleeping with his eyes open,
1796878 1798796 and so I really wanted to...<br />To see that in the movie,
1798880 1801800 and we had our opportunity<br />here with this scene.
1801967 1806012 I just think it's so wonderfully bizarre<br />and weird that he's kind of sleeping there
1806096 1809891 with his... I think people think<br />he's dead the first time they see him.
1810058 1813478 -Where did you shoot this, Pete?<br />-C stage.
1813562 1816231 -Yeah, it was.<br />-Yeah. A long time ago.
1816398 1818566 Oh. For some reason I thought<br />we shot it in Queenstown.
1818650 1820300 I thought you shot it in Methven.
1820986 1823236 I think we built the<br />set for it down south…
1826158 1828243 So we only went inside if it<br />was raining, and it didn't rain,
1828327 1830912 so we ended up shooting it<br />up in Stone Street Studios.
1830996 1834207 I remember the day we shot it, actually.
1834374 1837710 Kind of an awkward little scene to shoot,<br />because the set's kind of small,
1837794 1840088 and we also had real issues<br />with the scale.
1840255 1842757 It's not so much early on,<br />but once everybody wakes up,
1842841 1844801 and starts running around.<br />You've got these two Hobbits,
1844885 1848513 and the big people in the room,<br />and I remember we... Us... It's...
1848680 1850932 There's all sorts of little cheats happen.
1859858 1864613 This was an important moment for us,<br />because it is our sort of opportunity
1864780 1868492 to establish Sauron<br />as the villain of this film
1868658 1872245 the way that he's now a presence<br />with the palantír.
1873789 1876792 We had a whole idea of going<br />into Pippin's head
1876958 1879544 while he's holding the palantír,<br />and seeing him inside
1879628 1882028 some sort of a cage, didn't we,<br />in Sauron's...?
1882130 1885550 So it's some sort of metaphysical<br />representation of what he's seeing.
1885717 1888052 But at the end of the day<br />it was just too tricky
1888136 1891973 to kind of try to dramatize that,<br />so we sort of stayed outside of it
1892140 1895394 as it were, and just sort of saw<br />what was happening to Pippin.
1895685 1898335 I was very interested to see<br />what Gandalf wore to bed.
1901233 1904833 What... What is he wearing? Is it<br />like a sort of under robe or something?
1905445 1907572 -He doesn't have pajamas, does he?<br />-No, it's just his underclothes.
1907656 1912206 It's kind of quite Chinese-y. It's sort of got<br />trousers and that sort of smocky thing and...
1912369 1915719 Well, he's a kind of a...<br />He's a groovy dude, isn't he? He's kind...
1917666 1919584 That's right, seeing Gan...<br />You don't actually associate Gandalf
1919668 1922796 with lying in bed, do you,<br />in... In his... In his jammies?
1922963 1924506 But here we... Here we are.
1928802 1932555 This was all kind of tricky. This was... The<br />shots like this we did with Big Paul's...
1932639 1935016 Where you're looking at Billy Boyd,
1935183 1938186 and we had to have these big hands,<br />because obviously Gandalf's hands are...
1938270 1940730 So we found the biggest hands<br />that we possibly could
1940814 1944818 which were Big Paul's hands,<br />this big 7-and-a-half-foot-tall guy.
1944985 1949573 And... And so Ian would give him instruction<br />of how he wanted his fingers to move.
1949739 1953284 And would... Actually, often, I would have<br />the actors direct their doubles
1953368 1957080 because they sort of knew<br />what they wanted to do better than I did.
1962461 1965411 ...which tells Gandalf<br />exactly where Sauron is gonna strike.
1970343 1970594 Where is he gonna strike?<br />And obviously the answer is Minas Tirith.
1970760 1973471 But we didn't want Gandalf<br />to have that knowledge straightaway
1973555 1976015 because otherwise there's basically<br />no drama at the beginning of the film.
1976099 1980020 So we sort of back-engineered a mystery,<br />which was, "Where is he gonna strike?"
1980187 1984107 We tried to engineer that with Saruman,<br />and then this is another beat, isn't it?
1984191 1986526 And then we actually did a bit of dialogue<br />in this scene as well.
1986610 1987903 Yep.
1990530 1991989 This was originally two scenes.
1992073 1994659 In the movie that we shot<br />three or four years ago
1994826 1997226 we opened on the scene<br />that you're seeing now.
1997329 2000706 Then we went... Halfway through it,<br />they were talking about Frodo and Sam,
2000790 2003709 and we went to the scene in the culvert,<br />where they're lying in the culvert,
2003793 2006629 and, you know, the earthquake happens<br />and Gollum, and then we come back
2006713 2008339 to the conclusion of this scene.
2008423 2012385 But the editing of this movie, inevitably,<br />all of these little connections and plans
2012469 2015096 that you have get thrown out<br />once you start cutting it together.
2015180 2017480 And we ended up collapsing<br />this scene into one.
2017641 2019600 And we actually had to flip shots around.
2019684 2022437 Guys were looking in the wrong direction<br />at the wrong time,
2022521 2026471 and we had to flip shots left to right<br />so that they got their eye-line right.
2026608 2030237 We even actually played<br />one of Ian McKellen's shots backwards.
2030403 2033532 Because we had a shot where<br />he was walking towards Aragorn.
2033698 2036033 We wanted to have him<br />walking away from Aragorn,
2036117 2038411 and the only way we could figure it<br />was to play it in reverse,
2038495 2041372 and hope that people wouldn't notice<br />that it was being played backwards.
2041456 2043207 It was a tricky little scene.<br />It shouldn't be tricky,
2043291 2047241 and it doesn't look tricky, but it was<br />a bloody nightmare to put it together.
2056846 2060296 Our biggest problem here was that Pippin<br />had looked into the palantír.
2062143 2064061 We didn't want to make Gandalf<br />taking him to Minas Tirith the big issue.
2064145 2066273 Gandalf has to get Pippin out of there
2066439 2068608 because really the story's<br />not about that by now.
2068692 2070651 It's about warning the people<br />of Minas Tirith.
2070735 2073113 But we also had to get<br />Pippin with Gandalf.
2073280 2076324 That was always a sticky, sticky<br />thing to get through.
2084332 2086882 I was always amused at the dog<br />that crossed twice
2088837 2089004 in the background in the wide shots.
2089671 2093021 Well, Rohan... Well, Rohan had a<br />whole dog-trainer program going on.
2094926 2095927 They're one of the<br />few places in Middle-earth
2096011 2098888 that really, you know,<br />had instigated that particular program.
2098972 2100307 Yeah.
2100765 2103351 An MP from Parliament came<br />on the day we shot this.
2103518 2105895 We built Edoras in conservation land.
2106062 2108606 You know, it was built on a<br />very protected area of New Zealand
2108690 2112276 that we had to be very careful with<br />the impact on the environment and things.
2112360 2116531 And so it was good to... To... To have<br />members of Parliament coming along,
2116698 2118699 and being able to show them that we were
2118783 2121369 trying to be as careful<br />as we possibly could.
2127917 2130795 ...between these two, and that<br />Merry's frustration and anxiousness...
2130879 2132797 ...because he understands<br />and knows, of course...
2132881 2134799 ...that Pippin is going to be<br />taken from him.
2134883 2137886 And we actually wanted them<br />to not part on good terms.
2143016 2145851 ...with the separation.<br />Not have it just be, "Oh, bye-bye."
2145935 2148145 "I'll see you later, you know,<br />good luck," sort of thing.
2148229 2152067 We wanted it to actually have<br />a more emotional separation than that.
2152609 2154709 That's the look between Gandalf and Merry.
2157530 2159908 This is part of Pippin's story,<br />was to grow up.
2160075 2162577 He's still, at the beginning<br />of this story, acting as the...
2162661 2166581 As the curious, careless young Hobbit.
2166748 2170835 And part of his journey,<br />of course, is... is to maturity.
2173546 2175846 That guard they rushed past<br />there was Big Paul.
2178802 2179677 And it's the only time in the movies<br />that Big Paul gets his face actually seen.
2179761 2181887 This shot's a little tricky,<br />because you're seeing
2181971 2183723 the small version of Merry running
2183807 2185683 who is the 4-foot-high scale double.
2185767 2188478 And then we had Dominic Monaghan<br />on his knees
2188645 2190980 waiting for the scale double<br />to get around the corner.
2191064 2194864 And then without cutting the camera,<br />we had Dom popping up in the foreground.
2195193 2198093 And this scene was really<br />also about the fact that Merry…
2200490 2201490 Has always taken<br />responsibility for Pippin.
2201574 2204452 And now he's actually powerless<br />to do anything.
2206996 2208946 -So you never put in Legolas' poem?<br />-No.
2209499 2210125 -So you never put in Legolas' poem?<br />-No.
2210291 2212376 We put his poem back in<br />for the Paths of the Dead.
2212460 2214337 -Yeah, but to Treebeard...<br />-But we didn't put it back in here.
2214421 2217382 No, no. No, because it<br />wasn't linked into this scene.
2218299 2220885 There's another little deleted moment<br />where Legolas and Treebeard
2220969 2222887 have a conversation about<br />the Elves leaving
2222971 2226474 which we shot, but we never used it.<br />Because it was originally going to cut
2226558 2228184 directly from that conversation
2228268 2231855 to Liv and the Elves<br />on their way through the forest.
2232021 2236192 But because in the editing of the film,<br />the two moments from Isengard
2236359 2239654 to here got separated by<br />all of the Edoras sequence
2239821 2243199 it was no longer<br />a very useful thing to do.
2243450 2246850 We also wanted to signal the fact<br />that this world was going to end...
2248830 2251165 And that's the knowledge<br />of Treebeard and Legolas
2251249 2255086 that there's not going to be room<br />in the world for these creatures anymore.
2255170 2258047 Great moment for the 25th anniversary<br />edition, if I can remember...
2258131 2259215 -Okay.<br />-...to put it in.
2259299 2261050 -Can you remind me?<br />-Just write it down.
2261134 2263344 The sooner you remind me...<br />Just remind me in about 20 years,
2263428 2265728 so that I can start thinking<br />about it again.
2269684 2273084 This was originally, again,<br />a possibility of being in <i>The Two Towers.</i>
2274981 2276357 One of the things that we came to<br />with Arwen's story
2276441 2279444 is that we had written the fact<br />that she was leaving
2279611 2281696 that she was going to leave<br />and forsake Aragorn.
2281780 2284448 And we had written ourselves to<br />the point of, "Why would she stay?"
2284532 2287159 And I remember Fran and I,<br />one morning, trying to figure out:
2287243 2288693 "Why the hell does she stay?"
2288787 2291330 And we came up with the idea<br />that she stayed for the child
2291414 2293332 because we know she does have a child
2293416 2295626 that this was her<br />one chance to be a mother.
2295710 2297295 That is beautiful.
2301966 2304666 That little boy is called...<br />His name is Sadwyn Brophy.
2307138 2307597 He's a wonderful, wonderful actor.
2307764 2310809 -Five years old and such fantastic focus.<br />-Yeah.
2310975 2317732 He's the son of Jed, who has taken<br />various roles in the three films.
2317899 2320401 So it was lovely to... To have him.
2328827 2330977 That was Fidwick, isn't it?<br />What's his name?
2331871 2332580 -Fidw... Fidwit? What was his...?<br />-No, Figwit.
2332747 2334040 -Figwit.<br />-Figwit, yeah.
2334207 2337042 Yeah. And that was actually put in<br />just for fun for the fans
2337126 2339170 because we didn't even know<br />about this character.
2339254 2340588 I can't even pronounce his name.
2340672 2344509 And yet this guy was created<br />by the fans, really.
2344676 2349097 He was an extra in the Council of Elrond<br />scene in <i>Fellowship,</i>
2349264 2352224 and so much fuss had been made<br />about him over the last couple of years
2352308 2354310 that we had this moment<br />where we wanted Arwen
2354394 2357605 to just have this, you know, just this<br />brief moment with an anonymous Elf.
2357689 2360107 We thought, "Well, rather than<br />making... Make him anonymous
2360191 2362527 let's make him Fig... Figwit."
2362694 2364028 -Figwit.<br />-Figwit. What?
2364195 2365695 "Frodo is Great. Who is That?"
2366114 2367614 "Frodo is Great. Who is That?"
2372829 2375829 The conflict here is that her father<br />knew about this child…
2378084 2378918 And yet he was still...<br />To save her life, he was still prepared
2379002 2385258 to sacrifice the possibility of there<br />being a child born of Arwen and Aragorn.
2387677 2391177 These two scenes of her in the forest<br />and then coming back to Elrond...
2393057 2393725 And they were gonna be in <i>The Two Towers,</i>
2393892 2397394 but we felt it was better to leave<br />the story line unresolved in that film,
2397478 2399063 and actually resolve it in this one.
2399147 2402566 God, this movie inherited a... A hell<br />of a lot of <i>Two Towers</i> stuff, didn't it?
2402650 2403859 -Yeah, we did.<br />-It could be called
2403943 2406154 <i>The Two Towers Part Two.</i>
2407780 2409740 But it's better.<br />I mean, it's one of those great...
2409824 2412409 I love that organic process of,<br />you know, making films.
2412493 2414286 Especially when...<br />When you're dealing with...
2414370 2416370 -Sorry.<br />-Well, no, you're dealing with...
2419626 2419918 Yeah, the "organic process of<br />filmmaking."
2420084 2422634 As opposed to the "chaotic<br />and cataclysmic process"?
2423588 2425488 It's organized confusion, basically…
2428885 2432013 And it morphs itself into another plan.
2432180 2435099 And somewhere you just hope<br />that one of these plans is good.
2435183 2440271 -That's called "desperation."<br />-Not necessarily... Not necessarily always...
2440355 2441605 but sometimes you get lucky.
2441689 2444817 We sort of cut this together<br />as a much tighter sequence
2444984 2448988 which allowed us the opportunity just<br />to tell the story through several scenes.
2449072 2452075 And so we did... We did trim<br />some of these scenes slightly.
2452241 2454491 I love those tiles.<br />We should use those tiles.
2458206 2461125 -The Elves had good taste.<br />-They're just a bit of old... Old custom wood.
2461209 2462042 -Are they?<br />-Yeah.
2465088 2467138 -The library? No, well, I didn't...<br />-Yeah.
2472261 2474138 ...the mythic library scene.<br />You see, we won't say anything more.
2474222 2476891 We'll just hint at it and not tell them<br />what actually happens in the library.
2476975 2479425 -They can find out in...<br />-It's in honor of Fran...
2482814 2484481 -Don't say anything.<br />-They're heading on the Internet.
2484565 2486108 Don't say anything about<br />the library scene.
2486192 2487360 -Okay.<br />-No.
2487527 2489570 Okay, nobody mention the library.
2489737 2492637 What we really need to do<br />is orchestrate some lost footage.
2493324 2495618 It needs to go missing,<br />and then it can be found...
2495702 2497902 Oh, you mean like<br />the spider scene from <i>Kong?</i>
2502041 2505253 And then we could find it again<br />in about 20 years.
2505878 2509882 The shots of Hugo staring here.<br />He was actually looking at the painting
2510049 2511884 of the Last Alliance when we shot it.
2511968 2515554 But we decided to make it look like he<br />was looking at the forging of the sword.
2515638 2517681 It was a nice intense close-up<br />of him that we had,
2517765 2522270 and we felt it was more useful to us<br />at this particular moment.
2527692 2528734 But we thought that was very undramatic.
2528818 2531818 We probably spoke about this<br />in the commentary two years ago.
2535783 2538160 -...will probably have heard all that before.<br />-Right. Don't repeat yourself...
2538244 2540371 -...is that what you're saying?<br />-Well, you can repeat yourself...
2540455 2542373 ...and you always do<br />repeat yourself, but...
2542457 2545793 But, you know, you don't<br />necessarily have to... Have to put the...
2545960 2548963 These people are listening to<br />11 and a half hours of commentary,
2549047 2551090 and they don't need to hear<br />the same thing twice.
2551174 2552884 Okay.
2562143 2566393 The ride of Gandalf to Minas Tirith is one<br />of those great icons in the book, isn't it?
2566481 2568482 I remember John Howe<br />did a beautiful painting of it.
2568566 2571819 And John Mahaffie directed<br />most of those galloping shots
2571986 2574488 which are very...<br />They're beautiful and it was nice.
2574572 2578617 And I love this sequence, too, of Gandalf<br />thundering up the streets of Minas Tirith.
2578701 2582038 You know, I wanted it to be<br />a musical crescendo moment
2582205 2584457 a moment for Howard to just let rip.
2584624 2587960 And also to show the size of the city.<br />Because the design of the city
2588044 2591964 is just one of those wonderful winding<br />streets that go higher and higher up the hill.
2592048 2594498 And it was a chance...<br />Because, in a movie, you...
2594592 2597261 Once you get locked into dialogue<br />and people are talking,
2597345 2600097 and this plot's unfolding,<br />you are just pushing along,
2600181 2603517 and you don't have a chance to really...<br />To indulge in this sort of thing.
2603601 2605728 But early in the movie<br />I just wanted to say:
2605812 2608897 "Let's have a scene that's about the city.<br />That's not about the story.
2608981 2612026 It's just about this great locale."
2612193 2614793 So I was really pleased that we<br />were able to do that.
2618282 2619782 Oh, the bloody old White Tree.
2623704 2623871 That was a difficult one to get in.<br />The White Tree and what it stood for.
2624038 2627188 Yeah. We didn't... We never really<br />quite nailed it in the movie.
2629210 2633131 But it's there, and it should be there,<br />and we just balls it up a little bit.
2633297 2635216 -We did it as best we could.<br />-Yeah.
2635383 2638635 It was one of those details where<br />ultimately the film can't sustain
2638719 2641513 all of that information that Tolkien<br />put into the books.
2641597 2643891 You can't explain everything, and you...
2644058 2645976 -We just never really found a way to.<br />-We tried!
2646060 2650606 We tried and failed, but we never<br />really figured out how the White Tree
2650773 2651982 is important to the movie.
2652066 2654652 Because in a way<br />it's not important in our movie.
2660408 2662910 This was one of the biggest sets<br />that we built.
2663077 2667456 And it was actually built in a...<br />A tin shed down on the docks.
2667623 2670667 And all of the original soundtrack...<br />Because what you're listening to here
2670751 2673796 is not original, it's all added,<br />the dialogue is added later.
2673880 2677680 But the original soundtrack, you can<br />actually hear the sound of... Of trains.
2677842 2680010 Because right outside<br />there was a big container wharf,
2680094 2683180 and there were these trains that<br />were running backwards and forwards
2683264 2686141 with containers, loading them on<br />and off, and shunting engines.
2686225 2688925 And it was as noisy as all hell,<br />but it was actually...
2689020 2693191 It was the biggest warehouse<br />we could find in the Wellington area.
2693357 2696610 And... And it's the only place we could<br />actually fit this set into
2696694 2699614 because it was a fairly huge build.
2699780 2702074 And it was also one of the last things<br />that we ever shot.
2702158 2705453 I... I remember these days<br />that we were filming Denethor
2705620 2710416 was our last... Probably the last four<br />or five weeks of principal photography
2710583 2712126 in December 2000.
2712293 2716130 So I always look at this stuff and<br />I just remember how exhausted I was.
2716923 2722261 I was almost falling over with tiredness<br />when this stuff was being done.
2724931 2728893 Sean's fantastic. It's so compelling.
2729060 2730510 We could have kept using him.
2730645 2733897 All the... The women who lusted after<br />Sean Bean were called Beanstalkers.
2733981 2736066 -Yes, that's right.<br />-There were a few of them on our crew.
2736150 2737526 -Yes.<br />-Philippa possibly being
2737610 2739820 -the queen of the Beanstalkers.<br />-No, I wasn't.
2739904 2741322 I was restrained.
2741489 2743199 Yeah.
2745493 2747995 John Noble is a really interesting actor.
2748162 2751249 He is someone that, you know,<br />is not very well-known
2751415 2753500 just from the mere fact<br />he hasn't made many films.
2753584 2756587 But he's a very experienced<br />stage actor in Australia.
2756754 2759173 And Denethor is a very<br />Shakespearean character,
2759340 2760924 and John's done a lot of Shakespeare.
2761008 2764303 And when we auditioned him,<br />he was making the lines come to life,
2764387 2768015 and giving them meaning in a way<br />that I'd never heard before.
2768182 2770643 You know, I could... The...<br />The archaic language
2770810 2772352 was suddenly making sense to me
2772436 2775230 because he was putting all<br />the emphasis on the right words,
2775314 2777691 and delivering it in such a...<br />A wonderful way.
2777775 2779985 And that's one of the reasons<br />why I wanted to cast him
2780069 2783769 was that I just... I just loved<br />his interpretation of... Of that language.
2785533 2787576 We also didn't want to put a beard on him
2787660 2789369 because I think when you read the book
2789453 2791580 he's even described as having<br />a beard in the book.
2791664 2794291 But we just ended up with<br />so many people with beards,
2794375 2798671 so many old guys in positions<br />of authority having long beards
2798838 2801882 that we actually made a conscious<br />decision to have Denethor clean-shaven.
2801966 2805720 Just to separate him from Gandalf.<br />From Saruman, from Théoden.
2811934 2814234 And of course he's not sitting<br />on the throne…
2817398 2817898 He's sitting at the foot of the throne<br />in the chair of the steward.
2818065 2821415 Yeah, I've always loved the steward idea.<br />The idea of the steward...
2823404 2825781 That's what you face when you're making<br />movies, is just these little things
2825865 2828200 which, sort of,<br />you take for granted in a book,
2828284 2829785 but, you know, how do you describe
2829869 2831995 without stopping the story<br />dead in its tracks?
2832079 2835082 How do you describe the concept<br />of what a steward is
2835249 2836959 as opposed to a king?
2837126 2840671 And I... You know, it was the little<br />challenges like that that were ultimately...
2840755 2842172 Some of those were the most<br />annoying things, weren't they
2842256 2843382 when we were writing it?
2843466 2848137 It was... It was just trying to not<br />grind the story to a halt
2848304 2850890 to get some of these<br />fundamental ideas across.
2867448 2870450 A lot of this scene was done with<br />Ian McKellen by himself, of course
2870534 2871994 then we shot Billy Boyd
2872286 2875456 against a blue screen much later<br />and composited him in.
2875623 2878501 So Ian had to be looking down<br />at an invisible Pippin
2878667 2881003 whenever he was reacting to Pippin.
2885966 2888594 The history of Gondor<br />was something that I'm...
2888761 2890387 Actually got quite fascinated about,
2890471 2893432 and I think it's an interesting part<br />of the back-story,
2893599 2896227 but very difficult to use in the movie.
2896394 2900314 And we did shoot this...<br />This lecture that Gandalf gives to Pippin.
2900481 2903359 Didn't really use much of it<br />in the theatrical cut.
2903526 2906069 You know, and it's not<br />hugely relevant to the story,
2906153 2908853 but I do love the language that...<br />That Tolkien used.
2919166 2922419 This shot here is possibly one of<br />my favorite shots in the movie
2922503 2924463 which never made it<br />into the theatrical cut.
2924547 2926423 And hardly any of this really existed.
2926507 2928425 I just think it's ended up<br />being so majestic,
2928509 2931178 and I'm thrilled to actually see the<br />shot, to tell you the truth, finished
2931262 2934306 at last after about four years<br />of being in development.
2934473 2935306 It's lovely.
2939770 2940854 Traveling around and...
2940938 2943440 -It's all right. What's wrong with that?<br />-No, no, just needed it.
2943524 2946424 -But we're back with our actors. Ian...<br />-Eight more frames.
2949989 2952739 I could have traveled a bit<br />further down the other side.
2953492 2955744 It's all to do with traveling down<br />the other side.
2955828 2958247 -It is, really.<br />-Getting to the other side.
2959248 2961917 I'm glad this shot's back in there.<br />I quite like it.
2966255 2970050 I was always intrigued in the book,<br />the proximity of Minas Tirith to Mordor.
2970217 2972302 I always liked the idea that Mordor<br />seemed to be this place
2972386 2974513 that was so far away,<br />that everyone was trying to get to,
2974597 2977641 and yet the city is kind of just,<br />like, right in front of it.
2977725 2979726 And I was always looking forward to<br /><i>Return of the King</i>
2979810 2982687 to actually visualize that.<br />Because it's right on the front lines.
2982771 2986025 And there's just this<br />creepy mountain ridge.
2986192 2988568 And everything that was happening<br />to Frodo and Sam
2988652 2990112 is happening just over there.
2990196 2992280 And that's one of the good things<br />with this movie is that
2992364 2996911 even though Frodo and Sam don't get to,<br />you know, to physically interact
2997077 2999527 with our other characters<br />until the very end
2999622 3002416 you... You... You have a proximity<br />between characters
3002500 3004251 that we haven't had<br />in the earlier movies.
3004335 3007003 And so you have Gandalf and Pippin<br />talking about Frodo and Sam,
3007087 3010508 and you know that they are<br />over there somewhere
3010674 3012134 in those mountains<br />that they're looking at.
3012218 3014845 And that was always, I thought,<br />a useful thing for our story.
3014929 3017529 It was also the tension of,<br />will the Rohirrim arrive?
3018349 3018390 It was also the tension of,<br />will the Rohirrim arrive?
3018724 3020309 Will they come?
3030945 3034445 This was a little scene that Fran<br />directed, this scene, during pickups.
3034990 3037740 Yes. Yes, it was a cold day<br />and we were chasing the sun.
3040412 3042262 -Freezing on that...<br />-It was horrible.
3047461 3049911 I always looked on this scene<br />as being a mirror...
3052800 3056428 "If I take one more step, I will go further<br />from home than I've ever gone before."
3056512 3059223 -Yeah.<br />-And... And Frodo encourages him.
3059390 3062518 And here, in the third movie,<br />the roles are reversed,
3062685 3065270 and it's Frodo that can't make<br />that step forward,
3065354 3067064 and Sam has to support him.
3067231 3070233 And that was really the way that<br />this scene was deliberately designed
3070317 3072069 to mirror the earlier one.
3077825 3079910 The day that we shot the statue<br />was a different day.
3079994 3082162 This is back in our original shoot<br />now four years ago,
3082246 3085207 and Sir Edmund Hillary,<br />the Everest mountaineer
3085374 3089211 the man who conquered Everest<br />in 1953, he came on set,
3089378 3092088 and we were shooting this scene<br />with Sir Edmund watching us.
3092172 3093772 Oh, he came to visit me as well.
3094800 3095968 -Yeah?<br />-We had Howard.
3096135 3098678 -It was Howard's first visit.<br />-Yeah, Howard Shore was there as well.
3098762 3099763 -Yeah. Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
3099930 3102474 And Howard was with us<br />and Sir Edmund came by.
3102641 3105185 -Yeah.<br />-I was shooting with Liv that day.
3108606 3112106 Sean Astin and Elijah Wood were<br />incredibly impressed with Ed Hillary…
3114111 3115362 Just because he is one<br />of the most famous explorers, you know.
3115446 3118323 He... He's achieved something<br />that is obviously so historic.
3118407 3122286 And his face appears on our $5 note,<br />the New Zealand $5 note.
3122453 3124412 So I remember scrambling around<br />in my wallet
3124496 3127146 to give Elijah and Sean $5<br />so they could get him
3127291 3129000 -to sign the note for them.<br />-Oh, that's cool.
3129084 3131670 And I... Fortunately, I did have<br />some $5 notes on me.
3131754 3135090 So I remember giving it to them<br />so they could get his autograph.
3135257 3136607 But that... That's illegal.
3137009 3138510 What, to deface money?
3138844 3141471 -Well, yeah, that's...<br />-They can sue them, arrest them.
3141555 3144892 Yeah, well, that's Frodo and Sam<br />what did it.
3145726 3149730 -Nothing to do with you.<br />-I was only the supplier of the cash.
3154610 3156760 This was always an<br />important scene for me…
3159990 3160824 Because it was an opportunity<br />to connect Frodo and Sam
3160908 3164160 directly with other characters. In<br />this case, obviously, Pippin and Gandalf.
3164244 3169291 And I love the way that the conversation<br />is about where Frodo and Sam are.
3169458 3172211 And you... We intercut between the two.
3172378 3174629 And somehow there's a feeling<br />that Gandalf knows.
3174713 3177049 He can feel that... Where they are.
3177216 3179176 Yeah, no, no, no, I agree.
3182971 3185974 Shots like this one were just done<br />with Ian McKellen standing on a box
3186058 3189352 a couple of feet higher than normal,<br />and we had the camera over his shoulder
3189436 3191980 looking down at Billy Boyd, and<br />Billy was just walking on the ground,
3192064 3195317 and Ian was on a box, and it's amazing<br />what you can get away with.
3195401 3199780 We... We figured out so many<br />simple tricks to cheat the scale.
3203492 3205953 Like this shot here has Billy Boyd<br />on his knees.
3206120 3208920 He's simply kneeling with his elbows<br />up on the railing,
3209039 3210415 and Ian standing behind him.
3210499 3212667 There's no special effect here,<br />it's just the two actors
3212751 3215003 shot at the same time,<br />and we just said to Billy:
3215087 3218187 "Just kneel down and suddenly<br />you'll become the Hobbit height."
3221468 3225018 We started to focus the storytelling<br />around this as a catalyst moment...
3226765 3227099 We started to focus the storytelling<br />around this as a catalyst moment,
3227266 3228666 for the beginning of war.
3228767 3232479 And... And to us it was very important<br />to get to this moment reasonably quickly.
3232563 3236442 It had been set up, discussed,<br />the story was moving towards it,
3236608 3239458 and we... We knew that we needed<br />to actually begin it,
3239570 3243490 and that we could spark it<br />off the balcony scene, the march out.
3243657 3245575 So that, in fact,<br />the mechanics of the story
3245659 3248078 were actually starting to kind of...<br />To get into motion.
3248162 3251289 Because otherwise there was a danger<br />of endless sort of dithering about,
3251373 3253792 but nothing actually beginning.
3259590 3260591 Oh, cameo.
3267514 3268015 It's Captain Pagwash.
3268348 3269683 Oh, that's terrible.
3269850 3271800 Oh, dear, oh, dear, there's no respect.
3275355 3275689 ...that's coming up later<br />in this extended edition.
3275856 3279443 It's, like, back to its full glory.
3283864 3285240 That was really something<br />we did in pickups.
3285324 3288535 We really built the Witch-king<br />up in a way.
3288702 3291454 We always had the scene where<br />Éowyn kills him on the battlefield
3291538 3295166 which happens much later, obviously,<br />but we never really had much early stuff
3295250 3298400 with the Witch-king preparing<br />for the attack on Minas Tirith.
3298545 3302174 And so all of these sequences with him<br />were ones that we added
3302591 3304510 during post-production.
3304676 3307221 The Witch-king was identified,<br />really, by us
3307387 3309556 as one of our principal villains<br />of this film, because, again
3309640 3311307 we have the same old bloody problem<br />with Sauron
3311391 3315646 is that he's a flaming eye, and he can't<br />make any sort of physical appearance.
3315813 3318314 And it was always a problem,<br />and we obviously did, at some point
3318398 3320275 think about having Sauron<br />appear on the battlefield,
3320359 3322409 but we ultimately abandoned that idea.
3322569 3326369 And we really felt that the Witch-king<br />was have... Gonna have to substitute
3326532 3329117 as the chief villain<br />for quite a lot of the movie
3329201 3331620 until we actually enter Mordor itself.
3331787 3335237 It is a puzzle, it was a puzzle.<br />It's, "Where does the Witch-king go?"
3335457 3337584 We've gotta set him up as a villain.<br />How do you do that?
3337668 3340128 Where is the best place to do that?<br />Oh, my God, of course.
3340212 3342762 We have our main characters<br />moving towards his lair.
3342923 3346551 So somehow we have to work it into<br />this thing that... That Gandalf is saying.
3346635 3349220 So it is about tension, you know,<br />but it's also about
3349304 3352304 getting through exposition<br />in a way that is not deadening.
3352432 3354782 Well, we had so many<br />different versions of this.
3357771 3359355 I mean, it died in the first hour, there was...<br />You just wanted to run out of the theater.
3359439 3360489 -It was...<br />-Screaming.
3360607 3363193 Yeah, there was nothing...<br />There was no engine driving the story.
3363277 3365153 It was without dramatic tension.
3365320 3368907 And so for us it was about<br />retrieving that and finding that,
3369074 3371034 and doing whatever we<br />had to do to, you know
3371118 3373161 bring back some story dynamics.
3379543 3381878 ...Tolkien artwork existing<br />before we started making the movie.
3381962 3383964 You know, Minas Tirith and Helm's Deep,
3385048 3388384 and Rivendell and Hobbiton had all been<br />drawn and painted on various books,
3388468 3390678 and calendars over the years.<br />But I don't think anyone
3390762 3392388 had ever illustrated Minas Morgul.
3392472 3395308 It was... It was a blank. It was<br />like something that no one ever did.
3395392 3399313 And I remember saying to them...<br />To Alan Lee and John Howe
3399479 3401397 when they arrived in New Zealand<br />at the very beginning, saying:
3401481 3404025 "You know what? I... I don't know<br />what Minas Morgul looks like.
3404109 3406945 I've never seen a picture of it.<br />I can kind of imagine it from the book,
3407029 3408279 but it's gonna be interesting."
3408363 3411700 And John was the person that drove<br />the design and he sat down,
3411867 3413576 and came up with this sort of fortress.
3413660 3417289 Because Minas Morgul is<br />a sister city to Minas Tirith
3417456 3420000 that they used to both be<br />Númenórean cities.
3420167 3421876 I mean, this used to be a good-guy city,
3421960 3425422 but it was subsequently...<br />In a war of a bygone age
3425589 3428800 it was overrun by Orcs, and the Orcs<br />have basically commandeered it.
3428884 3431470 And so we wanted the city<br />to have an old beauty
3431637 3435641 a place of wisdom and sort of elegance.<br />But it's been bastardized,
3435807 3442147 so that it has this, you know,<br />this commandeered kind of decaying look.
3444274 3447777 A great piece of sound design where<br />the sound sort of sucks to silence
3447861 3451531 just before that lightning bolt goes up.
3451698 3453951 I thought the guys did a great job.
3454117 3457267 And I never thought that<br />that was going to work, that... That...
3459456 3462856 It's just such a connection too.<br />I mean, I love Gandalf and Pippin…
3465170 3467005 And Frodo and Sam<br />are right underneath it.
3467089 3472427 And it's just so valuable. I just...<br />I, you know, it's... Just love the way
3472594 3476494 that we can finally get some connection<br />between these different story lines.
3478892 3482145 The helmet of the Witch-king<br />was redesigned during our pickups.
3482312 3485023 We had an earlier Witch-king<br />helmet design
3485190 3488610 that we thought we were going to use,<br />and we actually shot some footage
3488694 3490653 of that design<br />back in principal photography.
3490737 3494616 But we ultimately felt he looked like...<br />Too much like Sauron, that Sauron's look...
3494700 3497452 His appearance in the prologue<br />of the <i>Fellowship of the Ring</i>
3497536 3500086 was... Quite evoked the feeling<br />of the Witch-king.
3500205 3501873 And we thought that people<br />would get the two mixed up,
3501957 3503833 and they'd think that Sauron<br />was on the back of the Nazgûl,
3503917 3508463 so we had Weta do a radical redesign<br />on the Witch-king's helmet.
3508630 3511174 And I just said, "Listen, whatever you do,<br />make it look completely different
3511258 3513676 to Sauron's helmet.<br />There can be no confusion."
3513760 3516679 And Christian Rivers drove the design,<br />and we ended up coming up
3516763 3519099 with this very iconic Witch-king helmet
3519266 3521935 which does set him apart<br />from any other character.
3522519 3525605 So that was a valuable thing to do<br />at the last minute.
3532279 3535406 I remember the original footage<br />of this scene with them walking out.
3535490 3538201 There's a lot of takes that are just<br />ruined by the way that the Orcs are moving.
3538285 3542456 And we ended up picking the very best bits<br />and pieces that we could for the cut.
3542622 3545291 They end up looking like those creatures<br />out of <i>Wizard of Oz.</i>
3545375 3547825 Yeah. The Orcs should have been<br />relatively easy...
3551590 3553466 And partly it was the performance<br />of the Orcs, that we ended up...
3553550 3556550 And it wasn't anybody's fault,<br />it's just almost by osmosis...
3556636 3562934 We ended up with sort of waddling,<br />bent over, sort of duck-walking Orcs.
3563101 3565520 And everyone who was an Orc<br />felt you had to walk
3565604 3569941 like a monkey with a full...<br />With a nappy, with a diaper that was full.
3570108 3572568 You know, it was interesting,<br />but it too often evoked
3572652 3576114 a sort of Witchiepoo from<br /><i>H.R. Pufnstuf</i> kind of look
3576490 3578282 where we had hook noses and big chins.
3578366 3580827 And the Orcs, whatever way<br />you looked at them
3580994 3582704 they were ultimately just not scary.
3582788 3584455 Not in the way that the Uruk-hai were.
3584539 3586499 The Uruk-hai, we managed to get<br />a lot of menace out of them
3586583 3589002 in the Helm's Deep scenes<br />and stuff, but...
3589169 3591546 We actually set aside<br />some time during pickups,
3591630 3593131 and we had Richard Taylor and his guys
3593215 3596415 redesign the prosthetics of the Orcs,<br />redesign the costumes,
3596510 3599513 and what you see in the finished<br /><i>Return of the King</i> now
3599679 3602057 is a combination of some of our old Orcs,
3602224 3605018 but a lot of the close-ups<br />and featured characters
3605185 3608688 are the new Orcs that we re-shot<br />on pickups, just to make them look
3608772 3610565 a little bit more scary.
3610732 3613232 This was a scene that we did<br />on-set motion capture.
3613360 3615194 All of the motion capture<br />that Andy Serkis was doing
3615278 3619991 was done live as we were filming Elijah<br />and Sean on the set at the same time.
3620158 3623036 Usually it's done later<br />in a studio in post-production.
3627833 3632045 In Minas Tirith, you know, we built a big<br />set in the quarry where Helm's Deep was.
3632212 3635590 And we actually used the Helm's Deep<br />as part of the Minas Tirith set.
3635674 3636925 We just painted it white.
3637092 3640803 And I noticed in the back of the shot<br />just then, there was a big curved wall
3640887 3642847 which was actually the Helm's Deep wall.
3642931 3645600 There's the curved wall<br />on the left-hand side.
3645767 3649771 But Minas Tirith was a lot bigger<br />and it's more expansive than Helm's Deep.
3655902 3659114 Osgiliath was mostly a miniature<br />for the wide shots,
3659281 3662825 and then the close-up stuff was done...<br />The original shooting was done
3662909 3665828 out in a parking lot in the Hutt Valley<br />near a railway station,
3665912 3668664 and then in the pickups, and<br />we're looking at pickup footage here
3668748 3670708 where Faramir is walking through the city
3670792 3672168 they were done in a studio.
3672252 3675088 During our pickups we rebuilt the set.
3677924 3681135 In addition to the Witch-king, we wanted<br />to create another Orc character
3681219 3683519 who was like the general<br />on the battlefield.
3683680 3685890 Because we felt that our Orcs<br />were so anonymous
3685974 3688184 that we wanted to actually personify<br />one or two of them
3688268 3690854 just to give our villainy a focus.
3694858 3699446 The character that we're being<br />introduced to here just very briefly
3699613 3701156 is Gothmog.
3701615 3704326 We have a teasing shot<br />of his deformed hand here.
3704492 3707537 And I had the Weta guys come up<br />with the idea of Gothmog
3707704 3711917 as a sort of Elephant Man-style Orc,<br />some... An Orc who has been stricken
3712083 3716630 by some elephantiasis-type disease<br />and deformity.
3716796 3719882 Just because I wanted to, you know,<br />create a very distinctive character.
3719966 3723678 The name Gothmog is used by Tolkien,<br />but the physical description,
3723845 3727095 and characteristics are sort of<br />something that we came up with.
3727182 3730682 He was the lieutenant, probably one<br />of the Nazgûl, actually, Gothmog…
3732687 3734021 But he was one of the lieutenants<br />who captained the armies Pelennor.
3734105 3736605 The shot that we're looking<br />at now of the guards...
3739486 3740487 -That's...<br />-Kirk.
3740654 3743364 ...Kirk, our stunt coordinator,<br />who usually just coordinates.
3743448 3746409 He's not on-screen, and he just usually<br />controls the stunt guys.
3746493 3747952 But I said,<br />"Why don't you just put the suit on,
3748036 3749453 and have the honor of doing<br />the last shot."
3749537 3752415 And so we filmed Kurt<br />rolling down the stairs, he crashed
3752499 3754417 we did it three or four times,<br />and then we wrapped,
3754501 3755901 and we had our big party.
3756002 3759005 And that was the...<br />The end of our <i>Lord of the Rings</i> filming.
3766012 3768556 Here, that chap there<br />who's giving everyone spears
3768640 3772185 is actually Royd Tolkien,<br />J.R.R. Tolkien's great-grandson.
3772352 3775702 The Tolkien family have had<br />a fairly hands-off relationship with us.
3775855 3779859 Royd had seen <i>Fellowship of the Ring,</i><br />and he'd seen <i>The Two Towers,</i>
3780026 3783446 and he obviously realized that what we<br />were doing was okay, so he wrote to us,
3783530 3785615 and said, "Listen, I'd love to come<br />to New Zealand and visit."
3785699 3788034 And we said, "Do you want to be an extra?<br />Do you want to be a soldier?"
3788118 3790203 And he was... He was very happy to.
3799129 3801422 This sequence is a rather<br />elaborate combination
3801506 3804675 of a sequence we originally shot, which<br />you're looking at now with the water.
3804759 3806636 Which is, again, our wet set,<br />what we called it.
3806720 3809805 It's the same water that the guys<br />went on their horses outside Isengard.
3809889 3812600 It's the Dead Marshes, it's the...<br />Outside Moria.
3812767 3816354 We used a multipurpose little puddle<br />of water that we created.
3817522 3821025 John Mahaffie directed a lot of this scene<br />of the Orcs coming off their boats.
3821109 3824696 And then I directed the stuff<br />with David Wenham here.
3824863 3829326 So this is a really tricky little intercut<br />between new footage and old footage.
3829492 3833455 We had no water when I was shooting.<br />We just had David and the rocks.
3835540 3836958 So that's an old shot.
3837125 3841171 You know, and then this shot here<br />is an old. These splashes are all old.
3841379 3843172 There's stuff that John Mahaffie shot.
3843256 3845341 But whenever you see David<br />fighting with a sword
3845425 3847677 it's the new stuff that we did<br />in the studio.
3847761 3850179 Because we never really had Faramir<br />as part of this battle,
3850263 3853725 and obviously he's there,<br />he's commanding the army.
3853892 3857520 And we wanted to give him<br />some decent fight footage
3857687 3859814 just to help strengthen his character,
3859898 3862248 and his commitment to defending<br />Minas Tirith.
3869282 3871826 The beacon sequence is one of my<br />favorite scenes in the film.
3871910 3873160 -Me too.<br />-And it's one of those scenes
3873244 3876080 that Tolkien wrote about, but he<br />didn't make a sort of big deal of it.
3876164 3879167 I loved getting Alan Lee to come up<br />with some ideas,
3879334 3882378 for what it would look like,<br />and what would it actually be?
3882462 3885048 So Alan designed basically<br />what you're seeing here.
3885215 3889219 And Barrie Osborne did most<br />of the directing of this sequence.
3889386 3891345 It was a day that I was shooting<br />something else,
3891429 3893597 and so he had Billy Boyd<br />and this beacon was built
3893681 3896142 in the same quarry as Minas Tirith.
3896309 3898894 And Barrie pretty much directed<br />all of the sequence
3898978 3900521 where Pippin lights the beacon.
3900605 3902481 What I love about the beacons<br />is the concept
3902565 3905526 of who actually are the guys<br />who have to sit up there all day long
3905610 3909155 with some matches or a flint,<br />waiting to set light to them.
3909322 3911407 And I... I imagine that it's been<br />hundreds of years,
3911491 3912908 and these things have never been lit.
3912992 3915077 It's a job that gets passed down<br />from father to son.
3915161 3918706 And some old man hands his young son<br />the matches and says:
3918873 3922502 "Now it's your turn, my boy,"<br />and, "I never got the order to light,
3922669 3925671 but maybe some point in your lifetime,<br />you'll have to light it.
3925755 3927507 "Make sure these matches stay dry."
3927674 3930259 And they must have a very lonely,<br />solitary lifestyle
3930343 3934096 -living up there by these beacons, and...<br />-This is what you were thinking about?
3934180 3936724 -Yeah. This is... This is what was... I was...<br />-This was our problem.
3936808 3938517 I was thinking there might be a TV series
3938601 3939769 and...<br /><i>-The Beacon Boy.</i>
3939853 3942503 <i>-The Beacon People.</i><br />-You might get put on beacon duty.
3945358 3949008 You reckon it's like... It's like a<br />sort of national service in the army
3950780 3951906 that it's something that all young people<br />have to do before they get a real career.
3951990 3953199 Yeah.
3954742 3957370 When Pippin and Gandalf are riding to<br />Minas Tirith, the beacons are already lit.
3957454 3961499 So we obviously changed the position<br />in the story for our beacon sequence.
3961666 3964210 A lot of the flames that we see<br />in the distance
3964377 3967755 are little CG flames that we edit<br />in post-production.
3967922 3970841 The beacon that you're looking at here<br />was actually built on the mountains.
3970925 3974303 And we helicoptered the beacon in and<br />the little hut that these guys live in,
3974387 3978725 and we... We flew around in the<br />helicopter and shot it being set on fire.
3978892 3982269 But what you see here is real, there's<br />none of this is a... A special effect
3982353 3985565 apart from the distant beacon<br />that lights at the very end.
3985732 3988984 But the hills are real, those beautiful<br />clouds that are in the valley were all real.
3989068 3992363 It was all just absolutely the way it was<br />on the morning that we shot it.
3992447 3994747 And then we just added in<br />those distant flames.
3994908 3997159 This is a helicopter sequence<br />that David Nowell
3997243 3999243 our wonderful aerial DP, shot for us.
3999329 4001372 Obviously none of these fires<br />are actually there.
4001456 4004125 We added the flames in later<br />on the computer.
4005168 4007503 I just love the majestical size<br />of the sequence,
4007587 4010437 and Howard does a beautiful<br />musical track through here.
4011257 4012207 Ah, stunning score.
4012800 4013750 Ah, stunning score.
4024938 4026988 And finally Aragorn is back in the story.
4030109 4030985 That was one of our concerns, wasn't it.<br />About this film
4031069 4035657 is that for a while Aragorn sort of actually<br />just sits and waits for something to happen.
4036157 4039577 And I think we got away with it, but it's<br />not... You know, it was always our worry
4039661 4042163 because we wanted, obviously,<br />his character to...
4042372 4044707 No, if you had a choice<br />you would never do it that way.
4044791 4045875 No, but it's the way
4045959 4047585 -that Tolkien devised it in the book.<br />-Tolkien wrote it.
4047669 4051269 And... And it was important to get<br />to this moment as quickly as possible.
4053091 4054216 Because it basically energizes and...<br />And, you know, brings Aragorn
4054300 4055850 back into our narrative now.
4055969 4058419 It was about sort of trying<br />to create a mystery…
4061307 4062349 As to what...<br />What he actually was meant to do.
4062433 4065936 And that his path lay in another direction.<br />And that eventually he would have to go,
4066020 4069315 and become who he was born to be.<br />As Elrond says...
4069482 4071317 -Yeah.<br />-...and raise the Army of the Dead.
4071401 4073611 We tried to foreshadow that<br />without giving it away too much.
4073695 4074988 Yeah.
4084247 4087497 This was difficult, again,<br />because you have... You have Théoden...
4089502 4090794 We're having to go<br />somewhere else, not to Gondor
4090878 4095508 which you would normally do in a film, you<br />would have them all set off for Gondor.
4095675 4098219 But in actual fact, we needed them<br />to go to Dunharrow
4098303 4101096 which again is... Took a...<br />Took quite a bit of sleight of hand.
4101180 4103930 And just how do you explain that<br />to an audience, to say:
4106519 4108604 ...have been lit now, and they've<br />gotta rush off to help the Gondor,
4108688 4111440 but no, they're actually just gonna<br />pop off to a place called Dunharrow
4111524 4115474 "that we don't... Know nothing about,<br />and wait for a while instead of rushing."
4115862 4119281 So it was these little obstacles<br />that Tolkien's book kind of presented
4119365 4121450 in terms of...<br />As you say, if you were doing this
4121534 4125412 as an original screenplay, some of these<br />things you would actually not do, you'd...
4125496 4128207 You'd change the story line, but...
4128374 4130876 Dunharrow was something that we needed,<br />because it's the entrance
4130960 4134610 to the Paths of the Dead, and that's<br />ultimately why we had to go there.
4143139 4146851 A nice little sequence with<br />Merry, who's... Dom's on his knees,
4147018 4149645 and that's Kiran, our scale double,<br />kneeling down there.
4149729 4153065 This was filmed, obviously, on our Edoras<br />location down in the South Island
4153149 4156069 that we built, and part of<br />the original photography.
4161282 4164077 ...that we could never really<br />develop properly...
4164243 4166037 ...because we didn't have time.
4166871 4168771 This was another little pickup we did.
4173211 4174962 ...and so we shot the Orlando piece<br />with Brett...
4175046 4177756 ...John's double, on the back of the horse<br />and then we shot the close-ups of John.
4177840 4180926 And we just shot them in front<br />of the blue screen and we... We found
4181010 4184138 an old shot from<br />the South Island location
4184305 4186015 that we had done<br />about three years earlier
4186099 4188892 that served as a background plate<br />for the shot with Orlando.
4188976 4191576 It was actually filmed<br />in the Wellington parking lot.
4192480 4194732 The thing that's really happening<br />in <i>Return of the King</i>
4194816 4198277 which we did flirt with the idea<br />of originally in our scriptwriting
4198361 4201511 is that there is a broad assault<br />happening on Middle-earth
4201656 4203866 at this point in time.<br />That... That there's actually...
4203950 4206800 Lothlórien, where Galadriel<br />comes from, is being attacked.
4206953 4210247 And Lothlórien is on fire and there's<br />fighting between Elves and Orcs.
4210331 4214252 And Lothlórien, the northern mountains<br />where the Dwarves are based
4214419 4217254 is being attacked. And so<br />there's a war that's broken out
4217338 4219966 that Sauron has attacked<br />on multiple fronts.
4220133 4223177 And whilst that's spectacular<br />and it would have been kind of exciting...
4223261 4225804 And believe me, I would have<br />loved to have shown that...
4225888 4229142 It's difficult, because the film<br />is much better served
4229308 4232812 by focusing it on one central<br />battlefront, which is Minas Tirith.
4232979 4235356 And, you know, you have a problem<br />with Minas Tirith being attacked,
4235440 4237691 and you have to solve<br />the problem of how they defend it,
4237775 4239109 and ultimately what that leads to.
4239193 4241612 And once you have these battles<br />breaking out in other places
4241696 4243155 you've got to follow up on those.
4243239 4245407 And, you know,<br />who wins the Lothlórien battle?
4245491 4247242 I mean, how does that<br />suddenly resolve itself?
4247326 4249426 Shoot it as a pickup for the 25th edition.
4250288 4251955 -Twenty-fifth anniversary? You mean...<br />-Yeah.
4252039 4253374 ...we should shoot<br />all that and put it in the...?
4253458 4255125 Get Haldir out of retirement and...
4255209 4257809 Well, the Elves are immortal.<br />They... They won't age.
4259338 4261507 At least the Elvish actors will stay<br />as young as they are today.
4261591 4264510 Faramir's duty, obviously,<br />is to hold Osgiliath
4264677 4268138 which is really on the outskirts of<br />Minas Tirith, the real target of the Orcs.
4268222 4271225 But to get there they have to<br />take over this ruined city. And...
4271309 4274353 And Faramir is fighting as desperately<br />as he possibly can.
4274520 4277231 And it was important that there<br />was nothing about what Faramir did
4277315 4280776 that was a failure. That he was ultimately<br />overwhelmed by the numbers of Orcs.
4280860 4284154 He just could do nothing about it.<br />The size of his force was dwarfed
4284238 4285823 by the enemy that they were against.
4285907 4289368 But we wanted to show Faramir's<br />determination and his heroism
4289535 4291954 at trying to do his duty<br />as best he could.
4292121 4295374 But ultimately, you know, once you're<br />being overrun and the battle is lost
4295458 4298168 your then responsibility<br />is to save the lives of your men
4298252 4300045 which is why he orders the retreat.
4300129 4303298 That it's just hopeless and he has<br />to try to get back to Minas Tirith
4303382 4306594 because that's when...<br />Where his men can be best used.
4306969 4310319 That was a funny shot, because<br />we had Faramir in one of the takes...
4312058 4314852 And the camera then sort of pans off<br />to the sky so that you can see it.
4314936 4317355 And there was a big Air New Zealand jet.
4317522 4319072 -Was there?<br />-That's right. Yeah.
4319232 4321400 -I don't remember that.<br />-It was very funny.
4322109 4324859 I remember this day because<br />we did a press conference…
4327240 4328115 After we shot this actual footage<br />of these guys under the Nazgûl attack.
4328199 4330535 We then wrapped early<br />that day and we went,
4330701 4333579 and we did our very first press<br />conference in front of the media.
4333663 4337124 It was in... Towards the end<br />of the year 2000.
4339669 4344131 Gothmog is played by<br />Lawrence Makoare, who played Lurtz.
4344298 4348344 When we decided to add an Orc character<br />to <i>Return of the King,</i> we just thought:
4348511 4351555 "Let's give it to Lawrence. Let's...<br />Let's get Lawrence to do it again."
4351639 4354683 And the wonderful thing with prosthetics,<br />that if you have a... A great actor
4354767 4359438 like Lawrence who is just so brilliant at<br />pushing energy through that rubber mask
4359605 4363705 you can then create a completely different<br />character for the same actor to play.
4369198 4372785 See, this was a sequence<br />that we had a little bit of trouble
4372952 4374328 because we... We've put it
4374412 4376580 in a completely different<br />place to how... Where it was shot.
4376664 4379666 If you remember when Gandalf<br />and Pippin arrive at Minas Tirith,
4379750 4382461 for the very first time<br />and they get to the brow of the hill,
4382545 4384046 and stop and they look at the city
4384130 4387090 what was gonna happen was that<br />they were gonna see this retreat.
4387174 4389324 And then they were gonna go and intervene
4389468 4391568 before they even had gone into the city.
4391721 4393764 But we... We've now<br />put the sequence much later,
4393848 4398060 and we had Gandalf actually leaving<br />from the gates of the city itself.
4405651 4408153 I love this shot. I love the way<br />we're on a tracking vehicle,
4408237 4411240 and suddenly the camera whips<br />around, and there's Minas Tirith.
4411324 4415119 Which is... Gives it such a reality,<br />because you're on this bumpy vehicle,
4415286 4417579 and it's a shot that you don't expect<br />is suddenly gonna become
4417663 4419498 a special-effects shot.<br />But boom, there it is.
4419582 4422167 But that just shows you what you can do<br />these days with the tracking,
4422251 4425420 and putting miniatures into shots that<br />are rough and bumpy. In the old days
4425504 4428757 everything had to be so smooth,<br />and, like, motion-control cameras
4428841 4431426 had to be used if you were gonna<br />put miniatures into things.
4431510 4434310 But now there's such a degree<br />of freedom and flexibility.
4440186 4443481 This was a wonderful set that Grant Major
4443648 4446150 designed for us in the quarry.
4446317 4449028 And Minas Tirith was really<br />just one huge set.
4449195 4453866 And the big gateway into this courtyard<br />was the... The central focus.
4454033 4455993 And then up the hill
4456160 4458787 was all the little streets<br />and the alleyways, which you see
4458871 4461164 in all the other sequences<br />that we used for Minas Tirith.
4461248 4464961 It was actually quite extensive, and it<br />was a complex network of streets
4465127 4468130 that enabled us to shoot different<br />scenes and different places.
4468214 4471049 And looking up the street one scene,<br />down the street the next,
4471133 4475388 and this alleyway, that alleyway. And<br />we kept making the city look different
4475554 4479392 which was the beauty of the set<br />that got built. We were able to do that.
4479558 4482227 And occasionally we would make<br />the set look a lot taller
4482311 4484062 by adding miniature buildings<br />to the top of it.
4484146 4487525 But a lot of what you see<br />in these scenes is the actual...
4487692 4490392 The set that was built,<br />because it was pretty enormous.
4498244 4500746 This... Now, this is a scene<br />that I'm glad is back in.
4500830 4504130 Ah, yeah. It's one of my favorite<br />scenes between the two of them
4505918 4507461 picking up on the tension between the...<br />The father and the son.
4507545 4509945 I mean, it's one of the problems<br />with the film…
4512758 4515803 Rude to either David Wenham or John Noble
4515970 4518555 because, you know, they both<br />do superb work in this scene,
4518639 4520739 but they're secondary characters. And...
4520850 4523936 It's just one of those real difficulties<br />that you have so much in the film.
4524020 4527398 It's too long, it's too much going on,
4527565 4529692 and it's the secondary characters
4529859 4531944 that are the ones that,<br />ultimately, are expendable.
4532028 4535280 And it's a horrible term to use,<br />but there's nothing wrong with this scene.
4535364 4538534 And thank God it can actually be.<br />You know, put onto a DVD.
4538701 4541620 Because it's... It's...<br />It's important for these two characters.
4541704 4542997 But then...
4543456 4544956 -You know...<br />-You can feel it…
4549545 4550129 -Which is actually the better cut.<br />-It's where it needed to go.
4550296 4551380 -It needed to go.<br />-Yeah.
4551464 4554007 And, you know, you've just<br />heard this horr... You know
4554091 4557303 Gandalf has got a real bad feeling<br />about Cirith Ungol,
4557470 4559054 and that's where you need to go.
4559138 4561056 And... And yet this was<br />the only place for it
4561140 4564740 because you can't come back to this<br />moment, you needed to play it now.
4564894 4567396 And so that's why I understand<br />that it can't be in there.
4567480 4569580 But it's great that it is in this version.
4582828 4586040 It's interesting, I remember<br />the Sean Bean moment. We were in...
4586207 4588257 -Yeah, we were in that Manapouri...<br />-Yeah.
4591420 4591504 The Manapouri community hall.<br />And we were shooting the Black Gates
4591670 4593171 -in <i>The Two Towers.<br />-Two Towers,</i> yeah.
4593255 4594756 When Frodo and Sam were<br />crawling on the rocks.
4594840 4596550 -And Sean was going home.<br />-Yeah.
4596717 4598969 That's right. Sean was out there,<br />he was filming some other stuff,
4599053 4600679 and he was heading home to England.
4600763 4603890 And we were thinking, "Do we need<br />any more... Any more shots of Boromir?"
4603974 4605684 -Yeah.<br />-And we came up with the idea
4605768 4607102 of putting him in... In this scene.
4607186 4610086 But it was this image that he sees<br />Boromir and not Faramir.
4610773 4610898 But it was this image that he sees<br />Boromir and not Faramir.
4611065 4612815 Just... Just to explain to people…
4615903 4615945 The scene between<br />Denethor and Faramir in the hall
4616112 4618280 was a scene that we were<br />gonna be shooting about a year later.
4618364 4620214 -Yeah.<br />-Like it was on our schedule,
4620366 4622784 and it was actually...<br />All of the Faramir-Denethor scenes
4622868 4625662 were all the last thing that we were<br />shooting in December 2000.
4625746 4629041 And we were, like, with Sean Bean<br />in 1999 in the South Island
4629208 4633129 looking ahead, a year ahead,<br />and thinking, "Well, if we wanted
4633295 4634629 we could put him<br />in the scene with Denethor,
4634713 4636298 but we better...<br />We're going to have to shoot it now."
4636382 4639217 We got no idea what... Really what<br />that scene was gonna end up like.
4639301 4641970 But we just shot Sean against<br />some blacks that we hung
4642054 4644974 on the stage of this little hall,<br />right on the corner,
4645141 4647434 and just getting him<br />to walk forward, smiling,
4647518 4649895 and getting some alternative performance.
4652898 4655609 These scenes that we're looking<br />at now, if you can imagine
4655693 4659029 that at the beginning of the shoot we<br />started to film <i>The Fellowship of the Ring,</i>
4659113 4660822 and we filmed the Hobbits<br />arriving at Bree
4660906 4663117 we filmed the Hobbits leaving Hobbiton
4663284 4665911 the Black Rider scene on the road...<br />All of the scenes from <i>Fellowship.</i>
4665995 4669498 We went down to Queenstown having<br />only filmed <i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
4669582 4672626 And we were gonna continue on<br />filming <i>Fellowship</i> in Queenstown
4672710 4675212 except it was raining<br />and we couldn't go outside
4675296 4676588 which is where we were supposed to shoot.
4676672 4679549 And so we found the only studio space<br />we could in Queenstown
4679633 4682511 which was a very small squash court<br />in the back of a hotel.
4682595 4686098 We could only think of one set<br />that we could build in this tiny room
4686265 4689726 which was the ledge of Cirith Ungol,<br />because it was a very small set.
4689810 4691353 It was just this little piece of rock.
4691437 4694982 So we built it and we had to go in<br />as soon as it started raining.
4695149 4697776 I said to Sean and Elijah.<br />"Guys, I'm sorry to do this to you,
4697860 4700987 and I hate doing it, but we gotta go<br />and we gotta shoot the scenes
4701071 4702697 on the ledge from <i>Return of the King.</i>"
4702781 4705033 And I remember the utter horror<br />on their faces
4705117 4707994 of, like... Because they had only just<br />been doing that early stuff on <i>Fellowship.</i>
4708078 4710580 There was about six weeks<br />into the beginning of filming
4710664 4713083 of a... Of a year and a half.<br />And they had to start doing
4713167 4716503 these incredibly key, important<br />sequences from <i>Return of the King.</i>
4716587 4721383 So suddenly we had to take our mind<br />from leaving Hobbiton to the ledge,
4721550 4724386 and what would they be like?<br />How dirty would their clothing look like?
4724470 4727431 How... How much dirt and grime<br />would be on their faces?
4727598 4729891 What would their hair be like<br />after this journey?
4729975 4732686 And we hadn't filmed anything else<br />of them on the journey.
4732770 4735564 And we had to try to...<br />To imagine what they would look like.
4735648 4738066 And so what you're looking at here<br />with these scenes is, like...
4738150 4742947 Is us in this panicky kind of mode,<br />trying to put ourselves
4743113 4747113 into a completely different movie, and<br />a very key moment of a different movie.
4747201 4748751 And we didn't have Andy either.
4749370 4752170 No, Andy Serkis hadn't joined us<br />at that point in time…
4754625 4755376 So we had other people playing<br />Gollum instead of Andy.
4755542 4759492 And Andy eventually got to do the mo-cap<br />for it and... And the voice, obviously.
4759630 4761630 But he... He did that about three years
4762508 4765094 after the scenes themselves were shot.
4767012 4768597 And that's Lawrence Makoare, isn't it?
4768681 4771267 He also plays Gothmog,<br />who also plays Lurtz.
4771433 4773978 -Yeah.<br />-This was actually a key scene,
4774144 4777272 for us, because it... It was two of our<br />new characters that we created,
4777356 4779774 for the villainy, the Witch-king,<br />who did exist earlier,
4779858 4783111 but this is a new scene of him,<br />and Gothmog, our new character
4783195 4785113 interacting and talking about the attack.
4785197 4788491 And this... This was really the reason<br />that we created these characters
4788575 4791953 because we wanted the villains<br />to have a voice on the battlefield.
4792037 4794287 It couldn't just be Sauron<br />stuck in his tower.
4794415 4796374 And we wanted them to have their general
4796458 4800879 just as Gandalf is the general<br />of the good army.
4801171 4804071 This was the last scene we wrote<br />during the original shoot.
4806343 4809305 It was just before we were<br />about to wrap, finally.
4809471 4811471 It was literally the last scene written.
4811557 4814142 It was written because we had<br />an instinct that at that time
4814226 4817229 we felt that if Pippin was going<br />to be invested in saving Faramir,
4817313 4820065 and that he had this connection,<br />that it might be a good idea
4820149 4822249 to have a scene between the two of them.
4827156 4827239 Because when Faramir rides out<br />and Pippin is singing the song
4827406 4829407 -he's obviously touched with the grief.<br />-Yeah.
4829491 4832702 And then later on he's motivated<br />to try to save Faramir off the pyre.
4832786 4834246 -Exactly.<br />-And we realized
4834413 4837999 that we just don't... Didn't have any<br />connection between Faramir and Pippin.
4838083 4840933 That why would Pippin be caring<br />if he didn't know the guy?
4845758 4849058 You were both on sets filming madly,<br />trying to get things finished.
4851138 4853306 And I remember... We'd had this<br />discussion, and I had to write something.
4853390 4857603 And I remember at 11:00 at night,<br />trying to wake you both up.
4857770 4861565 You were both curled up on sofas,<br />and I was trying to read you stuff.
4861732 4863108 And you were both asleep.
4863275 4865026 -And Jan and I actually...<br />-I was so tired.
4865110 4868610 -...sent it out, regardless, the next...<br />-I was so tired in those days.
4868947 4870697 -Those last days of shooting.<br />-Yeah.
4873786 4877286 And I was... I was... I literally...<br />I think I managed to wake up Fran.
4878916 4880917 We have to wrap, and suddenly<br />there's a new scene to shoot.
4881001 4883587 And I remember it caused<br />everybody a lot of anxiety.
4883837 4886715 But, you know, we managed to squeeze<br />it in. I shot it very simply.
4886799 4888550 I shot it<br />basically in, like, two shots, really.
4888634 4892805 And the guys just did a few takes for us,<br />and we did it in a couple of hours
4892971 4894681 you know, we shot it and squeezed it in.
4894765 4897517 But it evokes to some degree<br />the Beregond relationship
4897601 4898701 -in the books.<br />-Yes.
4898811 4901730 Which is what I actually... It's a<br />part of the book I... I really like.
4901814 4904816 And I do regret that we never were able<br />to put that in the movie, where Pippin...
4904900 4906901 -It was just one more character.<br />-For people that haven't read the book
4906985 4910697 it's when Pippin befriends<br />a Gondorian soldier called Beregond.
4910864 4913825 And Beregond actually takes Pippin<br />under his wing, more so than Gandalf.
4913909 4916786 And he takes Pippin around the city<br />and talks about the city, and...
4916870 4920916 And it's a relationship, which, it doesn't<br />ultimately particularly go anywhere,
4921083 4923877 but it's quite sweet. And...<br />And this always reminds me
4923961 4926061 of the Beregond stuff, although we use...
4930676 4932719 But we also wanted to show here<br />why Faramir was about to do
4932803 4937015 what he was about to do, which is<br />his own personal sense of failure.
4937182 4939268 We found out that Pippin is the only son.
4939435 4942395 We imagine that he probably had a lot<br />of pressure on him from his father,
4942479 4945941 and had been maybe a disappointment<br />to his dad in some ways.
4946108 4949527 I remember Billy thinking about that,<br />that instead of settling down,
4949611 4951780 and thinking about becoming<br />the Thain of the Shire
4951864 4954574 Peregrin was running around<br />the woods with his mate, Merry
4954658 4956117 all of the time and getting into trouble.
4956201 4958411 And so there was this connection<br />between the two of them,
4958495 4960455 and that's why we wanted him<br />to be wearing
4960539 4963041 which is not from the book,<br />Faramir's armor.
4963208 4965858 Because Pippin is wearing<br />Faramir's childhood armor...
4968547 4971925 Because in the book Merry gets given<br />Théoden's childhood armor, doesn't he?
4972009 4973343 Yeah.
4973510 4976429 I love the way that John's playing<br />this scene with his sort of...
4976513 4980893 His disinterest or his... He seemingly is<br />disinterested in... In the fate of Faramir.
4981059 4984979 And it's... And he's doing it beautifully,<br />the way that he's manipulating the situation.
4985063 4987649 And Pippin is almost realizing<br />the manipulation that's occurring
4987733 4992446 isn't he, that Faramir, who's had it, you<br />feel, all his life, is just giving in to it.
4992613 4995713 It was also the reason to understand<br />why Faramir would do this.
4997743 5000870 He understands in this moment, when<br />his father says, "Yes, I... I wish that"
5000954 5003039 that it doesn't really matter<br />what he does now.
5003123 5006251 He cannot ever and will not ever<br />earn his father's love.
5006418 5008295 So it kind of doesn't matter.
5008462 5010464 It puts him in that very dark place.
5010631 5014731 Well, I've always felt that there was an<br />inherent threat to Pippin in this scene
5015969 5018680 because he says, "is there a<br />captain here who will do his lord's will?"
5018764 5022601 And if Faramir doesn't, at that point,<br />step in and say, "I will do it"
5022768 5024644 then there was a sense that maybe<br />Pippin would be ordered out.
5024728 5026078 But that's what Denethor
5027981 5028857 wants to achieve,<br />is he wants Faramir to step in.
5028941 5031291 -So if it's not one, it's the other?<br />-Yes. Yeah.
5039117 5040967 This is Sean's last shot in the film.
5045791 5047091 And it's Andy's last shot.
5047251 5050295 Well, it's actually not, because<br />we shot one of him in... At Forma...
5050379 5051963 -In England, yeah.<br />-...when we were in post,
5052047 5055467 but Andy's second-to-last shot, we...
5055634 5059134 It was just a little coda we put<br />on the front of this scene, wasn't it?
5060931 5065269 We felt that you needed to see Sam<br />trying not to fall asleep.
5065978 5068814 So this is obviously a big departure<br />from the book.
5068981 5072881 Yes, it is. And one of... One of the<br />things that happened very, very early on,
5074236 5078740 and this is going back to '97-'98,<br />we were writing <i>Return of the King,</i>
5078907 5082307 and this actually didn't change...<br />These are probably gray pages
5082452 5084871 that were shot as... As they were.
5085038 5087248 -And...<br />-Original pages that were never revised.
5087332 5090232 Not really revised.<br />I think, Fran, you did some revision…
5092546 5093546 During ADR and stuff,<br />on some of the lines.
5093630 5097509 But the actual concept of Frodo<br />sending Sam away
5097676 5101426 came because we felt... We really felt<br />the lack of dramatic development
5101513 5103223 in this situation.
5103390 5106768 There was a... A number of reasons.<br />One was to provide conflict,
5106935 5110564 and to continue the conflict.<br />And to have this sort of journey
5110731 5113816 up the stairs, where all it's<br />about really is how tired they are,
5113900 5116319 and how cold they are<br />and how hungry they are
5116403 5119865 is actually not that interesting on a...<br />In terms of film.
5120032 5124369 We also felt that the scheming of Gollum<br />needed to have a payoff
5124536 5126538 that he's been scheming against Sam.
5126705 5129541 We needed to pay it off,<br />he needed to win.
5129708 5131834 And we also felt very strongly<br />that we wanted...
5131918 5134963 I remember Fran sort of instinctively<br />knowing this
5135130 5139885 that Frodo had to enter that cave alone,<br />that he had to go in there alone, and...
5140052 5144056 Because as it plays in...<br />In the book, they go in together
5144222 5147851 there's a kind of a... Them getting<br />separated that is, again
5148018 5151188 inherently not that dramatic<br />as it plays out.
5151355 5154650 And we wanted that...<br />For Sam, just, again, to prove
5154816 5157819 that he's never going to leave Frodo,<br />and to turn up.
5157986 5163075 Which gives you that great gunslinger shot<br />that Pete put in when Sam does turn up,
5163241 5167746 and Frodo's about to be put away<br />for food by Shelob.
5167913 5170763 But yeah, that... That's the rationale<br />about why we made
5170916 5174795 this quite significant diversion<br />from the actual book.
5174961 5177211 -It's building up tension. It's just...<br />-Yeah.
5180425 5183303 It... It's doing what was sort of threatened,<br />which is that Gollum could break up
5183387 5185013 -Frodo and Sam's friendship.<br />-Yeah.
5185097 5187056 It's threatened in the book,<br />and we actually wanted
5187140 5188308 -to go beyond the threat...<br />-Yeah.
5188392 5191102 ...and make it a reality,<br />because that's just, you know...
5191186 5193636 ...making it ultimately more dramatic<br />for a movie.
5193772 5195273 Yeah.
5196858 5200403 And also, I can't remember what happens<br />in the book. It's terrible, isn't it?
5200487 5201488 -You...<br />-Yeah.
5201655 5203948 -I just forget the book.<br />-Yeah. What's us and what's that.
5204032 5205658 The movie, the book,<br />everything gets kind of muddled up.
5205742 5206952 -Yeah.<br />-So in the book
5207119 5209537 Frodo and Sam both go into<br />Shelob's tunnel, don't they?
5209621 5211789 -Yes, they do.<br />-And we wanted in the movie...
5211873 5214542 We thought it would be so much more<br />scary for Frodo to be in there alone.
5214626 5216044 -Yeah.<br />-And the only way we could do that
5216128 5218839 was to get Sam...<br />So it fulfilled several purposes...
5219005 5220205 -Yeah.<br />-...really, to us.
5220298 5223385 It gave us this great ability<br />to then have a period of time
5223552 5225303 where Frodo was all by himself.
5227139 5228806 I remember looking at an early cut, and...
5228890 5231476 And the way that I had shot<br />this scene originally
5231643 5235271 is that... is that Elijah was playing<br />very fierce and very... A lot of hate...
5235355 5239317 Hatred, wasn't he? A lot of anger,<br />and we just thought that wasn't working
5239484 5241284 -eh, Fran?<br />-It didn't feel true…
5245490 5245699 Through the writing of the scripts<br />and shooting the film,
5245866 5248076 so it was... It felt like we needed<br />to pull it back
5248160 5254791 from being a kind of quivering rage,<br />to a more conflicted moment for him.
5254958 5257758 -He's being...<br />-So was it...? It was one of those things…
5260338 5262090 And there was a moment<br />where we had Elijah free,
5262174 5264175 and we had a camera free,<br />and you grabbed him,
5264259 5267428 and just popped him sort of against<br />a green screen, didn't you, actually?
5267512 5268930 -Yeah.<br />-I remember, it was against green...
5269014 5270098 -Because...<br />-...it wasn't on the set at all.
5270182 5274182 Well, there are things that are preying<br />on him here, and one thing is paranoia
5275437 5279148 which is... It's the fulfillment of...<br />Of Gollum's promise, which is, you know:
5279232 5281032 "He will try to take it." So it's...
5281151 5285822 It's the Ring having a powerful effect<br />on how Frodo is perceiving Sam.
5286031 5293031 But it's also a sense of Sam's<br />actively jeopardizing the mission now too.
5293205 5295873 The infighting with him and Gollum<br />has got to the point where...
5295957 5297626 -Yeah.<br />-...Sam is threatening
5297793 5299795 their ability to move forward.
5299961 5302964 And he sees that as something<br />that has to be protected at all costs.
5303048 5307886 So he doesn't see many options for himself<br />but to send Sam away.
5308053 5311890 Ultimately, he pays the price for that<br />by having to face Shelob.
5312057 5315107 So that is the price for...<br />For not believing in your friends.
5315227 5317186 -Unless it's...<br />-It seems... It seemed to have a degree
5317270 5320620 -of, you know, logic to it.<br />-It feels more truthful that way too.
5323819 5328406 When he says it: "No. Sam, it's you,"<br />that Sam is holding him back,
5328573 5332494 and so all of these things<br />Gollum has succeeded in planting, and...
5332661 5335372 And the Ring has succeeded in planting.
5336915 5339959 And, actually, the other thing<br />that this scene does, ironically
5340043 5341961 is it shocks all the fans of the book.
5342045 5343921 All the people who know the end<br />of the story
5344005 5346174 are now on the edge of their seat,<br />because if we can do that
5346258 5348308 what the hell else are we about to do?
5350512 5354912 This was originally edited to be continuous<br />after Faramir leaves the hallway... The hall.
5355767 5358186 So he talks to Denethor.<br />And then we go straight into this.
5358270 5362107 But in rearranging the structure,<br />we put a little bit of a time gap,
5362274 5365485 and went to the Frodo and Sam<br />on the ledge.
5366695 5371616 We were very careful to pick extras<br />that we felt had the right sort of face
5371783 5375120 because we tried to handpick our extras<br />as much as possible
5375287 5379332 to give the best character faces,<br />and obviously find people
5379499 5384963 that could actually show a degree<br />of sadness and despair.
5385130 5388925 Because it's not that easy to do.<br />It's something quite difficult.
5393221 5400103 Everything was shot at 48 frames a second,<br />apart from this dialogue scene.
5409529 5412156 It was quite difficult to actually get<br />the horses to walk down the hill
5412240 5414158 because I remember that being<br />very slippery
5414242 5417328 that there were cobblestones on this<br />Minas Tirith set, which was a quarry,
5417412 5419580 and we had to put<br />new horseshoes on the horses
5419664 5422167 because normally they have<br />steel horseshoes.
5422334 5424669 But we had to put rubber shoes<br />on their feet
5424836 5427421 which means that they...<br />All the horses had to be re...
5427505 5429705 -Whatever you call it, re-shoed or...?<br />-Shod.
5429841 5433291 Shod. Otherwise they were slipping<br />on the cobblestones, and so they...
5433553 5435680 It was quite a big deal at the time.
5441394 5445523 And at the quarry here, the doors open<br />and you just saw the back stone cliff
5445690 5448317 of the quarry, but I think we had<br />a big blue screen out there,
5448401 5452071 and we managed to actually make it look<br />like it's Osgiliath in the distance.
5452155 5457577 Geoff Murphy shot some of the horse action<br />on Pelennor Fields
5457869 5460288 which I think he did a really good job.
5466127 5468254 I remember we had to reshoot some of this
5468338 5470340 because I wanted the horse charge
5470507 5473551 to be just with the armor-plated<br />Gondorians.
5473718 5476888 And that word hadn't got through<br />to second unit, so they shot...
5477055 5479557 They mixed it up with some Rangers,<br />like Faramir's Rangers
5479641 5482894 in the green and brown costumes,<br />and it just didn't look...
5483061 5485229 So I actually had them shoot it<br />all over again,
5485313 5487148 and just put<br />the silver-suited guys there.
5487232 5489567 You occasionally see some of the others<br />in the background
5489651 5492862 just to make up the numbers, but I<br />just wanted the... Sort of the knights
5492946 5494948 the shining suits of the knights.
5498201 5501051 I always loved that line,<br />"Sing me a song. Master Hobbit."
5503456 5504999 -Oh, so the line's in the book...<br />-Over the charge up."
5505083 5506792 -But this actually came off that...<br />-...but does he sing in the book?
5506876 5509754 It came off that line, but I'd also<br />gone out to a karaoke evening
5509838 5516838 with... With Billy and Dom and Orlando and<br />Elijah and Liv, and I'd heard Billy sing.
5517012 5519096 I remember coming back to you,<br />Franny, and saying:
5519180 5522391 "God, Billy Boyd has got the most<br />amazing voice, we've gotta use it."
5522475 5526604 And then we remembered this line,<br />"Give us a song, Master Hobbit."
5526771 5529271 So if you hadn't gone<br />to that karaoke night, you...
5530608 5531192 -This scene may never have existed.<br />-I don't know.
5531359 5532860 -Well, no, I mean that's interesting.<br />-Well, that's true.
5532944 5534820 -It's how those little connections happen...<br />-Maybe he couldn't sing.
5534904 5537032 ...and how you get the ideas for things.
5537198 5540618 I gave Billy some lyrics<br />and just found something from the book.
5540785 5544914 And he had, like, a day or two to come up<br />with some music, and he did.
5545081 5546791 So Billy actually<br />composed the tune itself?
5546875 5549675 -He did, actually. Yeah, he did.<br />-Yeah, that's beautiful.
5552672 5555716 I remember we came up with the idea<br />of the eating during this too
5555800 5557302 because there's something...
5557469 5561139 There's something very nasty<br />about eating and violence.
5561306 5563975 You know, the sort of, the... The...<br />And a sense of violence,
5564059 5566519 and a sense of killing his own son
5566686 5569814 while shoving strawberries<br />and tomatoes into his mouth.
5569981 5572981 And it's... It's just, I don't know,<br />it's something that's...
5573109 5575059 Well, it's cracking and spurting and...
5576362 5579407 -Yeah, the tomato is...<br />-It's... It's that...
5580075 5582410 -It's so... It's very venal.<br />-Juices.
5582577 5584621 -Yeah.<br />-It is.
5584996 5587196 But it's a bit...<br />It's sort of uncomfortable.
5590335 5590835 ...the fact that he's stuffing things<br />into his mouth...
5591002 5594422 ...than it would be if he was just sitting<br />in a chair, doing exactly the same dialogue.
5594506 5597092 It's sort of the fact that<br />he's sort of enjoying...
5597258 5600469 Because usually in situations like this,<br />when there's life-and-death situations,
5600553 5605016 and it's war and it's, you know,<br />huge threat, you would lose your appetite.
5605183 5607833 And the fact that he's sitting there<br />kind of eating
5607936 5611689 even that helps sort of show his...<br />How deranged he is,
5611856 5614442 and how sort of disconnected<br />from it all he is.
5616027 5620198 This shot here, we did during pickups,<br />and we didn't really have anything
5620365 5623034 from the original shoot<br />that showed Gandalf's reaction
5623118 5625370 to the loss of Faramir and his men,
5625537 5628237 and so we came up with something<br />very simple, and...
5628540 5631042 Just to sort of give us the mood.
5638341 5641386 This was shot in the South Island<br />near Queenstown,
5641553 5643220 and it's one of my favorite locations,<br />actually.
5643304 5646474 I don't know why, but I just love the<br />fields and the trees and the mountains,
5646558 5649060 and the wonderful, huge, big army camp.
5649227 5651395 Lots of extras.<br />One of our biggest extra days.
5651479 5656484 This would have been at least 300 soldiers<br />and about a hundred horses, probably.
5656651 5659320 It was a difficult bit of the story,<br />as we've talked about earlier
5659404 5663491 just having to somehow justify why, in<br />this urgent rush to get to Minas Tirith
5663575 5667119 they have the luxury of sort of stopping<br />and waiting and camping for a while.
5667203 5668996 But the scene between Aragorn<br />and Théoden here
5669080 5671332 is designed to somehow account for that.
5671499 5674199 We finally figured out that they have<br />an expectation...
5676671 5679771 -That there is not that many.<br />-Yeah, that Théoden is wanting…
5682886 5683761 They're all gathering<br />at this meeting place, but it's...
5683845 5686555 -It's all driving, hopefully, the narrative.<br />-It takes away the urgency
5686639 5688057 from the story a little bit,<br />that's the problem.
5688141 5691691 I know, but we were trying to drive<br />narratively towards this decision
5693396 5694522 that Aragorn must make, because he knows
5694606 5697525 they don't have enough men.<br />They... He knows time is against them.
5697609 5701487 So that when he is confronted with Elrond<br />saying. "You need more men"...
5701654 5704654 This was a sort of a dodgy bit<br />of the story too, because it…
5707118 5707744 That the camp that they're all waiting<br />for... For the soldiers to arrive
5707911 5711289 is the pathway<br />to the Paths of the Dead. It's just...
5711456 5713207 It's one of those weird<br />geographical things that...
5713291 5714334 Yeah.
5714500 5718504 I don't know, it... I just found it<br />a little bit icky around here, but...
5718671 5721671 Of course, this doesn't actually happen<br />this way in the book.
5722091 5722467 It is something that we changed.
5722634 5725719 Yeah, but... But the pathways,<br />the Paths of the Dead are still here.
5725803 5726429 -Those are in the book. Dunharrow...<br />-Yes.
5726596 5729396 ...was the way that you go<br />towards the Paths of the Dead.
5734229 5736079 -...taken that path. I believe.<br />-Yeah.
5742570 5745239 That shot of the ghost was so subtle<br />in the theatrical version...
5745323 5746740 -Too subtle, isn't it?<br />-...that we have...
5746824 5750161 We... We've done a thing on the DVD<br />to make him a bit more obvious.
5752497 5755797 No, but you won't in this DVD<br />that we're talking about right now...
5757669 5760213 Make the ghost a bit more<br />obvious and clear.
5760922 5763883 There was one point in an earlier draft<br />that we had Aragorn
5763967 5765567 looking at a vision of Arwen.
5765677 5768888 Because we were always thinking of ways<br />in which to connect the two characters.
5768972 5770890 And at one point he looks up at the path,
5770974 5773100 and he doesn't see the<br />King of the Dead as he does now.
5773184 5775561 He sees Arwen, who...<br />Who talks about his fate.
5775728 5778522 But we felt that we had to substitute that<br />for the King of the Dead.
5778606 5780984 And instead we put Arwen<br />into Aragorn's dream.
5781150 5784500 She is the one in the book that remind him<br />of the Paths of the Dead.
5785738 5788338 At this moment,<br />Philippa's thumbing through the book.
5788533 5791369 -Yeah.<br />-Looking for the appropriate moment.
5791536 5794163 "The days are short. If thou have haste,<br />remember the Paths of the Dead."
5794247 5795623 Yeah.
5796624 5798774 This... This was to really earn<br />the moment…
5801921 5803964 That we wanted to be some sense<br />of camaraderie between these two.
5804048 5807218 They were two characters that had really<br />had nothing much to do with each other
5807302 5809803 in the story up until now,<br />and so we wanted a connection
5809887 5811222 to start to form.
5816269 5817394 ...find him his helmet and suit him up.
5817478 5820428 It's Théoden's childhood armor<br />in the book, but of course…
5822900 5826050 Because we've already used<br />some of Faramir's childhood armor.
5829449 5832410 This was all shot in the studio,<br />a very, very tiny studio.
5832577 5836497 And we just put a few little dead pine trees<br />around and some wind through their hair.
5836581 5840752 But it was done under fairly minimal<br />circumstances during pickups, where
5840918 5842711 because you're just shooting<br />some extra scenes
5842795 5844838 you can't really afford<br />to build big sets or anything.
5844922 5847842 So we improvised,<br />and just in this little tin shed
5848009 5849718 put a few tents and some trees around,
5849802 5852752 and we sort of get away with it,<br />it doesn't look too bad.
5860104 5863983 And there was a little bit of extension there.<br />Where we just put the end of the scene in
5864067 5867867 that we originally shot, where Éomer<br />is really trying to dissuade Éowyn
5867987 5871532 from the idea of going to battle.<br />He sort of knows what she's thinking.
5871616 5874619 He has his suspicions<br />that she's gonna try to do something,
5874786 5876203 and he's trying to warn her off.
5876287 5878747 It's a bond between a brother and a sister<br />where each of them really knows
5878831 5880040 what the other is thinking.
5880124 5882424 It was also, we wanted to set up<br />her heroism…
5885296 5886714 Because he predicts that he would flee or<br />she would flee, their courage would fail.
5886798 5887799 And what we love
5888132 5891386 about her in that moment all alone<br />is that it doesn't fail.
5891552 5895052 The set at Dunharrow ended up<br />being filmed in four different locations.
5897058 5898434 The horse riding up the zigzag track<br />is at the quarry
5898518 5900227 that we shot Helm's Deep<br />and everything in.
5900311 5902229 Inside the tent is obviously in a studio.
5902313 5905817 We also filmed around near Island Bay,<br />some of the tent scenes
5905983 5908444 where Aragorn goes out<br />into Théoden's tent.
5908611 5910738 We filmed some near Mount Victoria
5910905 5913240 which was the scenes<br />where they're departing.
5913324 5915409 And then we built a piece<br />of Dunharrow Plateau
5915493 5917286 in the backlot at Stone Street<br />for pickups.
5917370 5920915 It's an amalgam of four or five<br />different sets or different locations.
5921082 5923917 Which is kind of weird, because it's such<br />a simple little... Little sequence
5924001 5927296 in a contained area, that you'd think we<br />could have just done it all in one place.
5927380 5929330 But it didn't work out that way at all.
5929465 5933302 It was actually quite a weird,<br />difficult little sequence to film.
5942728 5945078 One of the things that we always<br />wanted to do…
5948109 5948526 Or one of the things that we were<br />working towards with Arwen's story
5948693 5954198 is that she, in giving up her immortality,<br />sort of symbolized, really, by the Evenstar
5954365 5958411 which is a device that we came up...<br />A visual device which we came up with
5958578 5961330 that she would begin to become vulnerable
5961497 5964333 to the evil of the world<br />as it was growing
5964500 5968504 the evil of... Of Sauron as...<br />As he grows stronger.
5968671 5970464 And that was part of her protection.
5970548 5976429 She was one of the last born of her people,<br />and so was more vulnerable, in a way.
5976596 5979724 And so we wanted to sort of<br />have this about her
5979891 5982059 that this is a conscious decision<br />that she makes.
5982143 5986731 And that the longer she stays in<br />this world, the more vulnerable she is.
5986898 5993738 And we push it to a point where<br />she literally is becoming mortal,
5993905 5998284 and that any grace that was conferred<br />on her by being one of the Eldar
5998451 6000411 she has forsaken, she has given away.
6000578 6003414 And so she is dying,<br />literally dying, and it...
6003581 6005781 We wanted to push it<br />to the ultimate point
6005917 6011005 of Aragorn needing to destroy Sauron...<br />The failure of Frodo or Aragorn to...
6011172 6015843 To confront Sauron or to destroy the Ring,<br />would mean the death of Arwen.
6016260 6018804 And this is something that she's facing.
6025144 6028194 The presence of Elrond is the result<br />of us totally changing…
6030566 6031192 The broken-sword story, that
6031359 6034027 you know, as we've talked about<br />in earlier commentaries
6034111 6037490 Aragorn carries the broken sword with him
6037657 6040742 almost from the very beginning<br />of <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i> in the book.
6040826 6043162 And in the film we didn't want that<br />to happen.
6043329 6046373 We wanted the moment of the re-forging<br />of the sword to have a significance,
6046457 6050127 and to mark a particular point<br />in the... In the story
6050294 6052964 where the importance of that can be felt.
6053130 6055758 And so we had the broken sword<br />at Rivendell
6055925 6059475 we had it obviously being re-forged<br />at this particular point in time.
6059595 6062764 And then the question became,<br />"How does Aragorn actually get it?"
6062848 6066519 And it... We really just needed a courier<br />to deliver the sword.
6066686 6070439 And... And I know that we debated whether<br />it should be Arwen a long time ago,
6070523 6073609 and we ended up with Elrond<br />really feeling like the right person to...
6073693 6078739 To deliver the sword, and to basically<br />lay out to Aragorn what he has to do.
6085454 6088904 In the book, really, Elrond sends his sons<br />to Aragorn, so textually...
6090501 6092586 -But not with the re-forged sword, is it?<br />-No, no.
6092670 6094463 -He doesn't, because he already has it.<br />-It already has happened, yeah.
6094547 6096590 But he does, in terms<br />of the Paths of the Dead
6096674 6100761 send his sons with a message to...<br />To remember the Paths of the Dead.
6100928 6103222 So, you know,<br />textually, I think it's okay.
6103389 6106392 It's also... It's just the whole<br />rules of storytelling
6106559 6108977 which says you can't introduce<br />a new character here,
6109061 6112356 or perhaps a character<br />that you really don't care about.
6112523 6115275 Because you're missing this opportunity<br />for the personal investment
6115359 6120197 that Elrond has<br />in Aragorn taking up that sword.
6128539 6129639 The sword was so long.
6133919 6135504 I remember Viggo, when he first,<br />you know, came across the sword, he...
6135588 6138007 He really had worries<br />about fighting with it
6138174 6141260 because he was used to fighting<br />with a shorter sword.
6141427 6145138 And it was also so long that you couldn't<br />actually put the scabbard around your wai...
6145222 6146472 You know, on your belt,
6146557 6148141 and walk around with the sword<br />in the scabbard
6148225 6150143 because it was just dragging behind you.
6150227 6152980 And your arms weren't long enough<br />to actually pull the sword out
6153064 6155065 from a scabbard that was around<br />your waist.
6155149 6156817 So therefore we never had the scabbard.
6156901 6158944 Once Aragorn pulls it out<br />of the scabbard here
6159028 6161196 which he's able to do, because it...<br />He was just holding the scabbard
6161280 6163740 rather than having it strapped on,<br />we'd never bothered
6163824 6166326 with the scabbard anymore,<br />that he only just carries the sword
6166410 6167619 around with him the whole time.
6167703 6169663 Because it was just...<br />The thing was so huge
6169747 6170831 that it was actually
6170915 6174251 physically, it was too long<br />to be able to do anything with.
6174418 6177212 He straps it to his horse, he<br />doesn't put it around his... On his belt.
6177296 6180758 We just carry the sword into<br />the Paths of the Dead as a naked sword.
6187306 6188932 With our tiny set that we have here.
6189016 6190601 And this was particularly memorable<br />this day
6190685 6192436 because it was in the middle of a storm.
6192520 6196106 And I have a lot of admiration for Viggo<br />and Miranda's concentration here
6196190 6200319 because what you're listening to is<br />dialogue that's recorded later in ADR
6200486 6203614 it's edited in, you know,<br />after we finished shooting.
6203781 6207952 But the original dialogue was them talking<br />with the sound of this tin shed
6208119 6211163 crashing and rattling in the wind<br />and the rain.
6211330 6214500 And it was just a... It was a huge storm,<br />and it was so loud
6214667 6216376 that it was actually quite hard<br />to concentrate.
6216460 6218795 And yet, you know,<br />look at the two actors there
6218879 6222800 absolutely in the moment,<br />and ignoring everything else.
6233144 6235144 Did you put in, "I have wished you joy"?
6235438 6237988 Well, I... I liked the line too,<br />and I just thought:
6240317 6244803 Yeah, something he actually<br />does say to her.
6245656 6249577 We wanted to shift her<br />from a state of sort of despair
6249744 6253330 over Aragorn leaving her,<br />which Fran and I always felt made her...
6253497 6256247 Slightly weakened her,<br />that she was slightly suicidal
6256333 6259044 because some guy has ridden off<br />and left her
6259211 6264091 to actually being left by everybody<br />and everything that she loves.
6264258 6265467 Was that what we were doing?
6265551 6269429 Well, yeah, that's why we put that line in,<br />"Why can he not fight for those he loves?"
6269513 6271182 -Yes.<br />-That is a pickup scene.
6271348 6273600 -Yes, that's right.<br />-We didn't want to victimize her
6273684 6275311 in that scene.
6275478 6279482 And the first time we shot it, we...<br />We felt that she was too overwhelmed...
6279648 6281859 -Yes.<br />-...by being rejected.
6282026 6285446 -Yes.<br />-And we didn't want to overplay that part.
6285613 6288763 I liked the idea that the three friends<br />are the ones going up…
6291035 6292411 The Paths of the Dead, that they don't<br />have Elrond's sons taking it on.
6292495 6294037 -I think it's kind of...<br />-Or the rest of the Dúnedain.
6294121 6296832 Yeah, the Dúnedain. That's right...<br />Because all of the Dúnedain Rangers
6296916 6299167 all show up, don't they,<br />to be with Aragorn as well?
6299251 6302295 I think it's better that it's just<br />our principals, our three guys
6302379 6304005 it sort of just focuses it a bit more.
6304089 6309302 It just becomes very difficult<br />to introduce new people into the story.
6309386 6313336 This was a sort of interesting story thing<br />that we actually wrote about it here.
6315017 6317436 Because we thought,<br />"My God, we've got Aragorn"
6317603 6320188 who's one of their heroes,<br />who's now leaving the guys,
6320272 6322772 and they all feel that<br />he is riding with them,
6322900 6325610 and obviously riding to Minas Tirith,<br />and yet he's suddenly deviating
6325694 6327238 "off onto another path."
6327404 6329489 Which doesn't really happen<br />quite like this in the book.
6329573 6333911 And... And so we actually wrote this scene<br />to talk about exactly that
6334245 6336329 that they felt that he was<br />abandoning them.
6336413 6339792 Rather than have the audience feel it<br />and us not to address it
6339959 6341668 we actually addressed it,<br />didn't we, sort of
6341752 6344152 sort of head-on and made it<br />part of the story.
6349176 6350009 He knows now.
6354431 6355015 He knows that he is going to his death.
6355182 6359436 And he's not... He's not doing it<br />for vainglorious reasons,
6359603 6362898 but to do what he should have done<br />in the beginning
6363065 6366277 which is to leave a better world for...
6366443 6369530 Or... Or to at least give<br />the young people
6369697 6372992 the hope of a better world<br />to leave behind.
6373158 6376458 That's why he's saying, "You shall live<br />to see these days renewed."
6376620 6380082 Which is a particularly beautiful<br />sentiment, which we always loved.
6385629 6387798 Was this directed by you, Fran,<br />and John Mahaffie?
6387882 6389132 Of principal photography.
6393137 6396237 Yeah, I think this is...<br />It's one of my favorite little scenes.
6402813 6404713 It's quiet and it's kind of dignified.
6408235 6411385 It's vulnerable, but it's not<br />hysterical, or... Or over the top.
6417661 6421361 This location is a place called the<br />Pinnacles, which is in the Wairarapa...
6423125 6427420 And it's a kind of a... It's a great, distinctive<br />location that I have used in the past.
6427504 6430507 I shot the opening scene in a film<br />called <i>Braindead</i> here.
6431133 6432885 It... It was Skull Island.
6433052 6435596 And then when we were<br />making <i>King Kong</i> in 1996
6435763 6437931 a version of <i>Kong</i><br />that ultimately didn't happen
6438015 6440267 we had a big set-piece action scene
6440434 6442634 that we were gonna shoot<br />on location here.
6443145 6446190 And since <i>Kong</i> was canned in those days
6446357 6450778 I still had the idea for the location<br />going into <i>Lord of the Rings,</i>
6450945 6454281 and thinking it would be a great<br />entrance to the Paths of the Dead.
6454365 6456658 What was it...? What were you<br />gonna shoot <i>Kong</i> there?
6456742 6459292 -What was the scene?<br />-Oh, it was gonna be a scene...
6462539 6464750 In the version of <i>Kong</i> we're making now
6464917 6467043 we won't be able to use<br />this location a third time.
6467127 6468545 I think we... We've done it.
6468712 6473550 It's... We've popped our cookies<br />in terms of using the Pinnacles.
6473717 6475302 -But it's an amazing place.<br />-It's a...
6475386 6477805 It's a great place to actually be part of.
6477972 6479622 It's a hell of a helicopter ride.
6483102 6484269 It's... It's... That was one of<br />the worst chopper...
6484353 6485979 Chopper rides we ever took, eh, Fran?
6486063 6488273 -Yeah.<br />-It was so bumpy.
6488440 6491440 -We were terrified.<br />-It was good going the day I was there…
6493737 6495322 And it was really nice.<br />But, yeah. No, helicopters aren't good
6495406 6497741 -if it's a stormy condition.<br />-It's dodgy.
6497908 6499784 And we go into this little studio set.
6499868 6502495 I quite liked this set, actually.<br />It was quite bizarre.
6502579 6505540 Had the idea of having this little<br />entrance-way, but then having
6505624 6508474 these pine trees...<br />These dead pine trees overhanging,
6508585 6511435 so it was almost like a tunnel<br />under the pine branches.
6518595 6520639 Of course, this was just a little<br />bloody tin shed, wasn't it?
6520723 6521848 -Yeah.<br />-Near the airport.
6521932 6526854 It's always difficult to make studio sets<br />look like they're... They're really exteriors.
6527021 6529564 It always has to do with the lighting,<br />because you can't actually get
6529648 6532943 the huge degree of light<br />that you have from the sun.
6533110 6535821 And the lights of the studio<br />are too close.
6535988 6539866 They're not as far away as the sun, so<br />the angle of the light feels all wrong,
6539950 6541326 and the coverage of the light.
6541410 6543860 And it just... They always look<br />a bit fake, but...
6544455 6545747 You know, we did our best here.
6545831 6547958 We've put a lot of smoke into it,
6548709 6551002 and you try to fiddle around with it<br />in the grading as well
6551086 6554548 to color timing, to make it look<br />as realistic as possible.
6555132 6558182 I think coming off those other shots<br />of that gray landscape…
6560596 6560763 You get away with it.
6560971 6562847 That have just preceded it,<br />you know, the Pinnacles.
6562931 6564599 It... It segues it. I think it does.
6564683 6567683 Ideally you'd want a studio with<br />big skylights, wouldn't you?
6567978 6571228 Well, the higher... The... The...<br />The taller the roof, the better.
6573400 6573776 You know, if you have a high ceiling<br />on a stage
6573942 6576569 you can get some big lights<br />up top and shine them down.
6576653 6577988 Yeah.
6580699 6583327 And everything is energized<br />back at the camp.
6583494 6587956 The bit of Dunharrow that was built up<br />by Mount Victoria in an old quarry
6588123 6591126 very close to where we shot<br />the Hobbits hiding under the tree
6591210 6593545 in the very first...<br />Our very first day of shooting,
6593629 6596129 for the beginning of<br /><i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
6598467 6601970 A little bit different to the book, isn't it,<br />the way that Merry gets told to stay behind?
6602054 6604764 It was sort of similar, but obviously<br />the whole Dernhelm thing
6604848 6606100 which is coming up.
6606266 6608616 I mean... I... I...<br />I don't ever believe that...
6609353 6612355 I mean, Merry must be the stupidest Hobbit<br />on earth if he doesn't realize
6612439 6615192 that the guy that he's riding with<br />is actually Éowyn.
6615359 6619059 Because in the book he think... He<br />believes that it's Dernhelm, doesn't he?
6619196 6621281 -And we just didn't want to do that.<br />-No, we made it...
6621365 6623865 It would make Merry look<br />terribly, terribly dumb...
6623992 6626453 -Not able to recognize...<br />-Yeah.
6626620 6627912 ...Miranda under the helmet.
6627996 6631625 So we changed it all to make it<br />obvious from the very beginning.
6631792 6633793 And we didn't do<br />the Dernhelm thing at all.
6633877 6637255 It was just one of... One of those story<br />things which doesn't work in the movies.
6637339 6638715 No.
6639591 6642291 The original chopper shot<br />that you're looking at now
6642386 6644429 with all the CG horses in it,<br />that was a chopper shot
6644513 6646763 of Gandalf's cart heading<br />towards Hobbiton.
6646849 6650769 I looked at everything we had shot, and<br />the best aerial shot I could think of
6650853 6653229 where we had enough flat ground<br />to put all these hundreds,
6653313 6656441 and thousands of horses,<br />was a shot that... That we had done,
6656525 6658151 and we hadn't actually used it<br />in the movie
6658235 6660653 where there was an aerial shot<br />of Gandalf's cart,
6660737 6662489 for the beginning of<br /><i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
6662573 6667578 So I got Weta to paint out Gandalf's cart<br />and to put in all the CG horses.
6667744 6669746 There's no real horses there at all
6670080 6671331 they're just completely digital.
6671415 6673833 So we've extended the beginning<br />of this scene a little bit,
6673917 6676086 but there was a little bit<br />that we didn't put in
6676170 6678570 which is them finding<br />a skeleton with a torch.
6678672 6684261 You know, and... And Viggo did a little<br />thing with a flint and got the torch going.
6684428 6686179 But even when I was doing<br />the Extended Cut
6686263 6690113 I thought that was extending it just a<br />wee bit unnecessarily too far, so...
6690642 6693687 You have this, obviously,<br />this famous speech of Legolas'
6693854 6698066 which is very evocative and... And...<br />And Orlando did a nice job, and so...
6698233 6700401 I didn't want to show any of<br />what he's talking about
6700485 6704030 because I wanted it to be more<br />from Aragorn and Gimli's point of view.
6704114 6708264 And, of course, he's, you know... He's...<br />Legolas is seeing things that they're not.
6713081 6715667 Didn't have any close-ups<br />of John for this scene originally.
6715751 6718378 But we shot all this stuff<br />against blue screen in actual fact.
6718462 6720880 If you can imagine looking at these,<br />just, well, it was on a stage.
6720964 6722715 We didn't have any set,<br />because it was in pickups,
6722799 6726219 and we literally didn't have a set finished<br />or any caves or tunnels or anything.
6726303 6729764 So we just shot against blue and...<br />And Weta put the set in afterwards.
6729848 6732142 It was like... This is really like<br />what filmmaking is today
6732226 6734561 where you can shoot actors<br />against blue screen,
6734645 6736355 and add everything in later on.
6736730 6741985 I... I found this ghost stuff quite tricky,<br />because you don't quite know what to do.
6742736 6746323 It's... You don't want to get too<br /><i>Haunted Mansion-y</i>
6746490 6749743 kind of, you know, generic ghost stuff.
6749910 6752162 And yet you have to have something.
6752329 6755248 And we sort of avoided it in<br />the theatrical cut to some degree
6755332 6757876 because I never quite knew<br />what these smoky tendrils,
6757960 6759294 and hands would be like.
6759378 6762380 And we had played it more for comedy. We<br />played it through Gimli's point of view
6762464 6765466 which I think is... If in doubt,<br />get to have a laugh with Gimli.
6765550 6768000 -It was the...<br /><i>-The John Rhys-Davies Variety Hour.</i>
6769096 6771046 -Yeah.<br />-Yeah, he was good, though, John.
6773600 6775750 -Yeah.<br />-He brings the stuff to life so well.
6778188 6780648 -Good setup on the skulls.<br />-The skulls, yeah.
6780732 6781982 His helmet looks too low.
6784778 6785153 It looks like it's crashing into<br />the bridge of his nose.
6785320 6786420 Oh, yeah, probably is.
6786863 6789783 That's... He's a lot smaller,<br />that's probably what it was.
6789950 6792619 Oh, yeah, it might be.
6800711 6803661 So this is where the theatrical version<br />obviously kicked in.
6806049 6810095 I... I find, you know... I know that<br />we were designing these ghosts for ages,
6810262 6811888 and we never quite knew<br />what to do with them.
6811972 6813640 -Yeah.<br />-And then we had this idea
6813724 6818854 of having a... A skull underneath<br />the fleshy sort of zombie makeup,
6819021 6820772 so that you morphed between the two.
6820856 6822732 And then we... We were<br />in the middle of doing that,
6822816 6826069 and <i>Pirates of the Caribbean</i> came out,<br />and so we all rushed to look at that,
6826153 6828154 and of course they did<br />a sort of similar thing.
6828238 6830657 But not quite the same as us,<br />but we thought:
6830824 6833159 "Oh, my God, just in the year<br />that we're trying to do
6833243 6835536 these ghost things and come up<br />with something different
6835620 6838915 you know, <i>Pirates</i> has got some<br />really nice-looking stuff."
6839082 6841251 So we... We didn't really change<br />what we were doing,
6841335 6845088 but I, you know... The ghosts<br />were the... Always the bane of my life.
6845255 6848967 I just think they're a problem story-wise,<br />because once you've got a ghost army
6849051 6850927 you've basically got<br />an unstoppable force.
6851011 6854097 You've got a... You know,<br />an immortal army that can't be killed.
6854181 6859144 And I just thought, "Well, there's no<br />dramatic tension, there's no real sense
6859311 6862564 of 'Will Aragorn triumph or not?'<br />if you have ghosts."
6862731 6865233 And so what we tried to do<br />in the original scene here
6865317 6868319 is to have the ghosts, but to not have<br />any sense of whether or not
6868403 6871353 Aragorn has actually managed to...<br />To wrangle them or not.
6871448 6873032 Which is sort of how we<br />cut the theatrical version.
6873116 6875952 There's a little bit more on the tail<br />of this Extended Cut.
6876036 6877412 Yeah.
6880332 6882250 I like the idea of the<br />ghostly city, though.
6882334 6884043 That was... I thought that<br />was kind of neat
6884127 6888673 where you're in a big rock cavern, but<br />then not only are the ghosts visible,
6888840 6892761 but the city that they live in is<br />sort of visible in a ghostly kind of way.
6892928 6894762 The buildings are almost ghosts<br />of buildings
6894846 6896696 rather than just ghosts of people.
6896807 6899393 And so I kind of quite like<br />that idea, but...
6899559 6902509 So there's a few things in here<br />that were quite good, but...
6903313 6907275 I don't know, I just... I felt<br />particularly uninspired, I have to say...
6907442 6909319 -It's...<br />-...just in how you deal
6909486 6912336 with the ghosts in terms of<br />the narrative of the story.
6916743 6920893 -...of sort of slightly <i>The Twelve Tasks of...</i><br />-It's a wee bit Dungeons & Dragons...
6924459 6926252 -Yeah.<br />-...in those role-playing games.
6926336 6929214 And it does get... I mean,<br />obviously Tolkien invented it,
6929381 6932383 so you can't blame him for ripping off<br />Dungeons & Dragons,
6932467 6936054 but it is just one step removed from<br />where we've been in the movies.
6936221 6938723 -Yeah.<br />-It's... Yeah...
6939182 6942982 So in the end, we... Yeah, as you said,<br />the tension of this scene ended up...
6944312 6948525 We wanted it to revolve around<br />whether Aragorn fails or not.
6948692 6952529 And to reveal at the end,<br />at the last minute, that he doesn't.
6952696 6955949 But, again, in the...<br />When it came to the theatrical, it...
6956116 6958716 It really was a case<br />of getting through this stuff
6958869 6960995 as quickly as possible,<br />because it didn't really add too much
6961079 6962706 to the story, did it?
6962873 6964523 No. And we don't... In the book…
6968336 6968628 The Army of the Dead don't<br />actually come to Minas Tirith, do they?
6968795 6973383 It's just Aragorn and the Corsair ships<br />sailing Arwen's banner
6973550 6976386 which Elrond's sons have given him.
6976553 6978971 -And it's just a little different.<br />-They do destroy the Corsairs, though.
6979055 6980755 Yeah, they destroy the Corsairs...
6984227 6986771 But then we... We needed<br />a strong enough force
6986938 6989065 to defeat the Orcs<br />who were at Minas Tirith.
6989149 6991485 -Yeah.<br />-So we decided to use the ghosts
6991651 6993695 -in that way, didn't we?<br />-Yeah.
6996865 6999534 What's interesting is that<br />all these... This whole army
6999618 7001619 got entombed in the mountain,<br />didn't they, by...?
7001703 7006291 -Yeah.<br />-By Isildur many hundreds of years earlier.
7009461 7012672 The shot of the skulls rolling across<br />the floor was the last thing ever shot,
7012756 7016406 for the <i>Lord of the Rings,</i> which I<br />actually shot about three weeks ago.
7016760 7020764 I shot the shot of the skulls after we<br />won the Academy Award for Best Film.
7020931 7023391 I said... Said to the guys,<br />"It's probably the only time in history
7023475 7026894 that you've finished shooting<br />the last shot after you've won the Oscar."
7026978 7030428 -It's just kind of one of the weird things.<br />-There's probably rules...
7032442 7033652 All right.
7038198 7041448 So I kind of like the idea that<br />somehow you're evoking the fact...
7043328 7045455 These guys would have died,<br />they would have starved to death,
7045539 7048124 or whatever,<br />and died within the mountain.
7048291 7051753 And it's their ghosts that are...<br />That are continuing to live on.
7051920 7054422 But where are their arms and legs?
7054589 7056189 Ah, that's a very good question.
7058009 7059635 -And their ribs and their...?<br />-Do you think somebody
7059719 7061387 -stacked them somewhere?<br />-Well, maybe it was just
7061471 7062638 one of those stackings,<br />one of those tombs
7062722 7064765 where somebody went along afterwards<br />and stacked all their skulls
7064849 7066893 in a big pile,<br />and it's that that's given way.
7066977 7069354 The head room. The head cave collapsed
7069521 7071689 rather than the arm cave and the leg cave
7071773 7074484 which wouldn't be as interesting-looking.
7074651 7076601 This was always a good scene, you know.
7080198 7082798 Well, it's one of those<br />situations where, you know…
7085579 7087872 Because you never know whether<br />or not, you know, he got...
7087956 7089916 -Aragorn and the guys took the ships over.<br />-True.
7090000 7092127 But here you're setting up the ships.
7092294 7096631 And of course later on we also show them<br />being taken over by the Corsairs.
7096798 7099258 So you're leaving nothing<br />to anybody's imagination.
7099342 7102721 It's... It's all being kind of shown<br />one beat at a time.
7102887 7104848 But interesting-enough scenes.
7105015 7107715 If we'd been more obedient<br />to what the book had done…
7110395 7111270 We would have suffered a terrible loss<br />of story tension, because...
7111354 7114304 Well, the book in this...<br />In the case of the Corsair ships…
7116860 7117319 And you don't know<br />who is on them, do you?
7117485 7119335 -No.<br />-You get it told in recounting
7119863 7122657 -that Aragorn took over the ships...<br />-Yeah.
7122824 7124033 ...with the Army of the Dead and things.
7124117 7126494 So it's all a bit...<br />Sort of ass-about-face in the book.
7126578 7127871 Yeah.
7129998 7133292 I remember it being quite a big deal<br />to drag David behind this horse.
7133376 7136087 It was... Everyone was very worried at...<br />That if the horse bolted
7136171 7138130 he could get dragged along.<br />And he had a...
7138214 7140800 A sort of a quick-release thing,<br />that actually in David's hand
7140884 7144136 he had a little string that was attached<br />to a little mechanism on the stirrup.
7144220 7147470 And if the horse started to...<br />To panic and take off dragging him,
7147599 7150476 ...he could pull the string<br />and in theory it would release his foot.
7150560 7152562 I mean, fortunately, we never had to<br />find out if it was gonna...
7152646 7154522 If it was gonna work or not.
7155565 7158777 Like we revamped Gollum after<br /><i>Two Towers,</i> we revamped the Wargs.
7158943 7160611 We thought we'd be using them<br />more than we did,
7160695 7163155 but they're actually a hell of a lot<br />better than <i>The Two Towers</i>' Wargs.
7163239 7164824 They make you want to go back<br />and redo all of the stuff
7164908 7166242 in <i>The Two Towers</i> again.
7166326 7168578 -That's a new Warg shot.<br />-That's fantastic.
7168745 7171539 We didn't put it in the theatrical,<br />but I always quite liked it.
7171623 7172666 That was great.
7172832 7175032 What... What's going on<br />between the two Orcs?
7176002 7178602 -What are they saying?<br />-It's just him trying to be...
7181383 7183175 -His sort of pride is damaged...<br />-I love it. That's great.
7183259 7185928 ...by trying to make a sexy dis...<br />Dismount off his horse.
7186012 7188431 -Oh, okay. Okay.<br />-That's fantastic.
7192435 7195897 Now, the mayor of Wellington,<br />who at the time was Mark Blumsky
7196064 7198691 the mayor of Wellington was<br />actually throwing these heads.
7198775 7201402 He came out to visit the set<br />on the day we were shooting this,
7201486 7203863 and I thought, "Oh, well,<br />if he's... If he's here to visit"
7203947 7206574 he may as well make himself helpful."<br />So we put him up on the wall with the...
7206658 7209703 With buckets of rubber heads<br />and had him toss them down.
7209869 7212419 -He was a... A severed-head-chucker.<br />-A head-tosser.
7213998 7215083 A head-tosser.
7218169 7221119 I like John's reaction,<br />John did that really well. I mean...
7223466 7224383 The thing with the character of Denethor<br />is that John was always juggling
7224467 7227567 of what's too much, what's too little?<br />And it was difficult.
7228054 7230723 He did give us lots of variations<br />in the cut, that he did
7230807 7233309 much smaller performances,<br />he did big ones.
7233476 7237426 And it... It was always a bit Shakespearean,<br />I felt, the character of Denethor,
7237522 7239983 and I wanted to choose the moments
7240150 7243153 that had a slightly Shakespearean<br />quality to them.
7253079 7259294 We took a... A lead off our Helm's Deep<br />experience from <i>The Two Towers</i>
7259461 7264841 in trying to have the civilians<br />under attack as much as the soldiers.
7265008 7267719 Because you feel... You feel more emotion
7267886 7269929 once you see civilians<br />running and panicking
7270013 7274309 than you do if soldiers<br />are getting hurt. So we...
7274476 7276018 That's the old<br />women-and-children question.
7276102 7278354 The women-and-children question, yeah.
7278521 7282221 -The Orcs have got catapults, haven't they?<br />-The Orcs have got catapults…
7284694 7286404 And they're immensely powerful<br />counterweight weapons.
7286488 7288531 We... We used it in Minas Tirith to our...
7288615 7291284 To best effect,<br />because I like the idea that the...
7291451 7294412 That the boulders that Minas Tirith<br />fires are huge.
7294579 7296580 Like, I wanted them to be<br />about the size of a house.
7296664 7298416 I mean, at the end of the day,<br />they're not
7298500 7300550 they're about the size of a small car.
7302754 7305254 I was always worried about<br />Gandalf smashing that...
7305715 7307007 -Oh, I love it, that's a...<br />-I know.
7307091 7308968 Well, I was always worried about it.<br />I thought, "Oh, God"
7309052 7310469 -people are going to hate that."<br />-It's not Tolkien.
7310553 7313703 -It's not very Tolkien at all.<br />-No, and it's very Peter Jackson.
7315225 7317825 No, no. No, no, no.<br />It was... It was... It was great.
7320313 7321480 And then the first time I saw<br />the film screened,
7321564 7323232 -so many people cheered that I...<br />-Yeah.
7323316 7326820 -It's a total film moment.<br />-Yeah, it is.
7328071 7331921 Basil, our stunt rider, did a great job<br />riding Shadowfax up onto the stairs
7333409 7335359 which he did right up the staircase.
7338206 7341334 I love the shot of the big boulder<br />landing in amongst the Orcs.
7341501 7343651 I really wanted people<br />to feel the weight,
7343753 7346464 and feel the destructive power<br />of these rocks.
7348591 7351302 This shot here is what I call<br />the <i>Pearl Harbor</i> shot.
7351469 7353971 We actually did a previs on<br />this shot about two years before
7354055 7356682 <i>Pearl Harbor</i> came out,<br />then I saw the shot from <i>Pearl Harbor</i>
7356766 7360102 with the bomb coming out of the plane<br />and going down towards the <i>Arizona.</i>
7360186 7361486 And I thought, "Oh, God"
7361646 7364064 that's our boulder shot."<br />but I thought, "Oh, well
7364148 7367318 I can't be too worried about<br />that sort of thing."
7368611 7372782 And I like the fact that the only... That<br />they have no sort of ammunition as such,
7372949 7374492 so they're ripping bits of the city off
7374576 7377996 which is why we used<br />architectural elements
7378162 7380373 of the city to be flung into the air.
7380540 7383990 It's as if their... Their... The only<br />thing they can fire at the Orcs
7385336 7389257 is bits of their own city,<br />which I thought was a... A nice idea.
7391384 7396139 I just like the way that... The brutality<br />of all of these huge, big lumps of masonry.
7396306 7397890 Because you don't<br />normally think in movies
7397974 7401019 when people fire things from...<br />From... From catapults
7401185 7403479 you don't...<br />It doesn't really have much impact.
7403563 7408359 But I wanted to make the impact<br />of each of these things quite substantial.
7412405 7414555 And then the battle moves along in phases
7414699 7420330 because they... They initially have this<br />catapult and trebuchet kind of exchange.
7420496 7422123 And then the Nazgûls come,
7422290 7424875 and these things are really like<br />Stukas, aren't they?
7424959 7426961 Like Stuka dive-bombers and...
7427837 7431257 And flying down. And this was<br />another difficult thing to portray
7431424 7434552 not the Nazgûl themselves, but<br />the fact that they're supposed to be
7434636 7436763 spreading fear through the city.
7436930 7438639 Because, you know,<br />what can these things do?
7438723 7439923 What damage can they do?
7440016 7445229 I mean, they can obviously pluck people<br />with their claws or mouths or whatever,
7445396 7448315 but that... That's not going to make<br />a significant impact in the battle.
7448399 7451486 But what... What they're supposed<br />to do is be spreading fear,
7451653 7455782 and a loss of morale and a loss<br />of confidence through the defenders
7455949 7457491 which is the idea of the Nazgûls.
7457575 7460369 But it's, again, a very hard thing<br />to show on film, the...
7460453 7463122 You know, how do these things<br />make people scared?
7463289 7468002 And I don't know, we didn't really<br />do that fantastically well
7468419 7469670 apart from a few shots.
7469754 7472047 But I love these sorts of...<br />I just wanted this stuff...
7472131 7473591 This battle to be as dynamic as possible.
7473675 7475426 I wanted it to feel very different<br />from Helm's Deep
7475510 7477595 because I remember one of<br />the big problems we thought
7477679 7479305 we were going into here,<br />was the fact that:
7479389 7482391 We saw a battle of Helm's Deep,<br />now what can we do differently?
7482475 7485311 So we tried to stay away from<br />the iconography of Helm's Deep
7485395 7486770 with the ladders and the archers.
7486854 7489189 There's very little arrow firing<br />that happens here.
7489273 7490691 There's a wee bit, but not much
7490775 7493611 because arrow firing was<br />a signature of Helm's Deep.
7493778 7495905 -We tried to do things differently.<br />-Yeah.
7496239 7499199 I also liked the fact that the attack's<br />in daylight, for the most part.
7499283 7501368 I mean, there's a bit<br />of nighttime stuff later,
7501452 7505248 but, I... You know, it's good<br />that it's not sort of disguised
7505415 7509752 in the shroud of darkness,<br />but in this broad, you know, open day.
7511379 7513529 Oh, cool, you've got the attack<br />on the gate?
7516634 7519178 Now, obviously, you don't have to explain<br />why they bring Grond up
7519262 7520804 because Minas Tirith has got a big gate,
7520888 7523015 and they need a big...<br />A big battering ram.
7523099 7525684 So this was a little bit redundant<br />in the sense that you don't have to
7525768 7528518 show them failing to justify<br />the appearance of Grond.
7532483 7535444 Really to give Gandalf the role<br />of a general and a commander,
7535528 7538948 and make him very hands-on,<br />we wanted the focus of the battle
7539115 7542577 to be Gandalf trying to<br />out-strategize the Orcs,
7542744 7544787 and to give him a real hands-on feeling.
7544871 7546914 And... And we wanted him to get<br />his hands dirty, as they say
7546998 7548832 rather than just be shouting out commands
7548916 7551711 to actually be doing<br />some fighting himself.
7555631 7562472 Suffice to say that this is a mixture<br />of Ian plus a stuntman
7562638 7564932 who is also doing some of the fighting.
7565516 7567685 -Although Ian was a really good sort...<br />-He is.
7567769 7569436 ...in terms of throwing<br />himself into this, he...
7569520 7571022 -Yeah.<br />-He would, you know
7571189 7573732 -he'd really give it a go.<br />-He's pretty good with a sword.
7573816 7574233 -...he'd really give it a go.<br />-He's pretty good with a sword.
7574400 7577300 Battles are always much more<br />interesting if you see them...
7579781 7580448 And obviously we wanted to do<br />some of it through Pippin
7580615 7584118 not just about Gandalf, but also<br />have Pippin's experience of war.
7584285 7588498 I know Fran actually shot some<br />of the images of Pippin panicking,
7588664 7594295 and people running past him and<br />being knocked over, just to try to feel
7594462 7597562 that we were seeing something<br />from a Hobbit's point of view.
7597882 7602970 The thing about Mordor is that you have to<br />admire their tenacity, don't you?
7603054 7605472 -What, they just keep on attacking?<br />-They keep on coming.
7605556 7607266 -Yeah, I mean they have great kind of...<br />-They sort of channel that...
7607350 7609602 Channel that hatred as best they can.
7609769 7613269 -Yeah, they're very goal-focused.<br />-They probably go to psychiatrists…
7616109 7618902 So they can sort of work themselves up.<br />Sort of anti-psychiatrists.
7618986 7620486 I admire their relentlessness.
7620696 7624324 -Are you relating to the Orcs, Franny?<br />-I'm afraid I am.
7624408 7626202 -Has it come to this?<br />-Yes.
7627245 7630295 Well, with Grond we wanted it to be<br />towed by some creatures…
7632542 7633751 Because no one else knew what...
7633835 7635711 Oh, actually,<br />Tolkien talks about "great beasts."
7635795 7638464 He says, "And great beasts<br />are pulling Grond."
7638631 7642134 So he did have something in the book,<br />but nothing to give you any clue
7642218 7644137 as to what these great beasts were.
7644345 7648141 So Weta went to considerable lengths<br />to actually sculpt and design
7648307 7651018 a maquette and scan it<br />and build these things
7651185 7654564 which only ended up being<br />in one or two shots.
7663676 7666176 So here we are at the<br />beginning of the second disc.
7666637 7670037 -We're only halfway through.<br />-And I can't believe that some of you...
7670725 7672768 Shouldn't you get some sleep<br />or something and maybe
7672852 7674687 come back tomorrow?
7675772 7678399 This was the cameo scene, wasn't it?<br />Where everybody thought
7678483 7680776 it would be fun to dress up<br />as a pirate for the day.
7680860 7684322 We've got Andrew Lesnie, our DP,<br />Rick Porras, co-producer
7684489 7687617 Richard Taylor and Gino<br />from Weta Workshop were there.
7687784 7690084 You don't really need this scene<br />at all, but...
7690953 7693653 -Not... Not at all.<br />-No, I think "painful" is a good...
7698795 7701338 Look, I did a big fall onto the deck,<br />a big stunt fall,
7701422 7704672 and I didn't... I refused to have<br />any knee pads or elbow pads,
7704801 7707551 and I just hit the deck each time.<br />It hurt like hell.
7707804 7709722 -But we didn't even see it.<br />-Well, no. No.
7709806 7713206 What's the point in suffering for your art<br />if we don't get to see it?
7714602 7717313 The body fall was quite loud.
7718231 7720681 -What?<br />-No, that's the moment at which the film…
7724278 7728199 You know, a fantasy<br />movie into a Monty Python moment.
7728366 7729992 We...
7732829 7734371 There's nothing wrong with<br />Monty Python, though.
7734455 7736624 Underachievers.
7738167 7741253 I just want to say that while this was<br />going on, what were we doing, Fran?
7741337 7744882 -We were... We were trying to...<br />-Trying to save the film
7746008 7748511 from the clutches of the pirates.
7756936 7761315 I'm most proud of the way that he acts,<br />if you like, if you can call it acting
7761482 7763025 which it obviously is.
7763192 7767321 The subtleties and beautiful animation,<br />beautiful animation.
7767488 7771242 And obviously Andy Serkis<br />gave us the reference.
7771450 7773786 It's one of the last Gollum scenes<br />that we did too.
7773870 7778082 It's sort of the culmination of Gollum.<br />It's as good as Gollum ever got.
7780293 7782795 One of the pieces of design that I wanted<br />to do with Shelob's tunnel
7782879 7787383 was to make the ground undulating<br />so that you walk uphill and downhill
7787550 7790219 as you're making your way through<br />the tunnel. Because often in studios
7790303 7793013 you know, people think about the<br />round caves, but they... They think...
7793097 7795974 They sort of end up being quite flat<br />on the floor of a studio,
7796058 7799478 so I deliberately wanted to make it...<br />Which sort of comes across here
7799562 7802064 the way that you go around.<br />And those cobwebs...
7802231 7806485 Cobwebs are quite difficult. They were<br />made of some weird epoxy, rubbery stuff.
7807653 7813159 I like the bony kind of debris on<br />the floor too, little hints and clues.
7817788 7821166 And a lot of this stuff is supposed to be<br />us seeing things before Frodo does.
7821250 7824503 So we start to see skeletons<br />and bits of remains
7824670 7827131 before Frodo realizes quite where he is.
7829967 7832428 Is that a Gollum POV, or is that a...?
7835973 7839393 Yeah, I kind of... Though it<br />could be anything, of course.
7841020 7842813 And I remember<br />one of the character things
7842897 7844606 we were worried about with this sequence
7844690 7846400 was just to redeem Frodo in some respects
7846484 7849820 because the previous scenes we've<br />seen of him, he's sort of sent Sam home.
7849904 7851280 He's acted like a real bastard.
7851364 7853699 And now we wanted to help suddenly<br />get sympathy back for him.
7853783 7856577 So we just had to sort of fine-tune it.
7861457 7863793 ...non-idealized view of womanhood.
7868965 7872015 -She's got hairy legs.<br />-Well, she can't... She hasn't shaved
7872510 7875846 and... And she's having a bit of trouble<br />squeezing through places
7875930 7878265 she could get through before.
7878599 7880393 So we had some sympathy for her.
7889735 7891885 ...because this never happened<br />in the books.
7892029 7894990 We didn't want to feel like Sam<br />was coming to the rescue as such
7895074 7897117 because otherwise it would take<br />a lot of the tension away
7897201 7899453 from what was happening to Frodo.
7901789 7904589 If anyone looking at this movie has...<br />Still has doubts
7904709 7907210 that, you know, Shelob should have<br />been at the end of <i>The Two Towers</i>
7907294 7911007 I just say, well, look at what happens<br />from this point on
7911173 7912841 till the end for Frodo and Sam,
7912925 7917095 and imagine that being<br />their entire story in <i>Return of the King.</i>
7917179 7919306 You actually... If you stop and think<br />about it, you just couldn't do it.
7919390 7921892 You couldn't actually... You'd end up<br />having half of <i>Return of the King</i>
7921976 7924676 in <i>Two Towers,</i> if that's<br />what you wanted to do, so…
7938451 7940494 You're running in some syrup<br />and you can't get away.
7940578 7942955 It's like one of those nightmarish<br />situations
7943122 7946417 where it's just pulling you down<br />and dragging you down and…
7952882 7955759 Being a lot of fun to shoot, because<br />it is... It's where you can just...
7955843 7958220 You can have fun as a filmmaker,<br />because you can indulge
7958304 7960472 in all your own fears<br />and all your own anxieties.
7960556 7964310 And... And I'm terrified of spiders.<br />I hate cobwebs. I hate all that stuff.
7964477 7970900 And I kind of had a lot of fun trying to<br />just make a scene that was scary for me.
7971358 7975529 And we finally get the Galadriel phial,<br />the starlight
7975696 7978240 paid off after setting it up<br />all that time ago.
7979075 7981326 The first image of Shelob I wanted<br />to do was something that I'd seen
7981410 7985539 in National Geographic documentaries,<br />which was looking down a little
7985706 7990169 spider hole and seeing a group of legs<br />bunched in the darkness, sort of just legs.
7990336 7992170 -Disgusting.<br />-I wanted that to be the first image,
7992254 7997218 and then have her sort of coming out<br />of the hole and see her full size.
8007269 8010188 There's this horrible spider we have<br />in our gardens in New Zealand.
8010272 8014360 It's quite small. It's about an inch long,<br />and it's a sort of tunnel-web.
8014527 8016946 And when I was a kid at Pukerua Bay.<br />We always...
8017113 8019031 I always used to find these things<br />in the garden.
8019115 8021658 And I used to be digging around<br />the garden a lot, because I used to
8021742 8024142 dig trenches to do World War I<br />battle films...
8024286 8027331 -As you do.<br />-...and dig little roads and tunnels,
8027498 8029041 for my Matchbox toys and stuff.
8029125 8031877 And... And these bloody tunnel-webs,<br />they live in holes,
8031961 8037174 and I'd always find them. And I'd run<br />screaming away and run for Dad
8037383 8040783 because he wasn't scared of spiders.<br />And he could get rid of them.
8041554 8043388 No, funnel-webs are a different type<br />of spider.
8043472 8047122 But a tunnel-web is that little thing<br />with the orange body with the fat...
8052022 8054816 And all of the Americans that work<br />at Weta obviously didn't know
8054900 8057778 what I was talking about,<br />but Christian Rivers went home,
8057862 8061698 and he dug around in his garden, and<br />he brought one to work in a glass jar.
8061782 8063533 -Oh, wow.<br />-The following day he'd found one...
8063617 8065702 He'd got one out of his garden.<br />And he's terrified of spiders too,
8065786 8067913 so it was a really brave thing<br />that Christian did.
8067997 8071083 And we had that at Weta<br />as the model for Shelob.
8077631 8082970 He's got bungees around his<br />arms and ankles, and he's...
8083137 8086264 We kind of... We... I don't even know<br />what the cobwebs were made of,
8086348 8089267 but they're made of this stringy-like,<br />almost like hot melt glue.
8089351 8091061 And we used to have sheets<br />of the cobwebs that
8091145 8094690 every time we did a take.<br />We'd have to reapply cobwebs.
8094857 8098027 And all of the stretchiness<br />of the cobwebs was... Was there.
8098194 8099945 That was what it was...<br />The stuff was really like.
8100029 8104074 It was super stretchy,<br />but like SuperBall-type material.
8107036 8110206 We were always wanting to use<br />Andy Serkis as reference.
8110372 8112958 And so we shot this scene very late.
8113125 8116879 It was almost one of the last scenes<br />that we shot for <i>Return of the King.</i>
8117046 8119131 And then we went to London to do<br />scoring with Howard Shore,
8119215 8122593 and Weta was animating the scene.<br />And so we didn't really
8122760 8126060 have the proper reference we needed<br />from Andy for the close-ups.
8126430 8128849 So we had Andy come to the house<br />in London that we were staying in,
8128933 8131351 and we... And I had just got<br />my Handycam camera
8131435 8134146 my video camera, and I... And we videoed
8134480 8138192 Andy lying on the floor in the hallway<br />of this house in London,
8138359 8141319 and videoed his performance<br />of the shots that you're seeing now
8141403 8143780 these close-ups of Gollum looking<br />up at Frodo.
8143864 8147785 And we then cut those into the Avid<br />and we sent those back to Weta
8147952 8150621 as the guide for the animators.
8155876 8158295 Gollum always knows the Ring is going<br />to be destroyed, doesn't he?
8158379 8161779 And he just wants to sort of change<br />his mind. Or does he not realize?
8161966 8163300 -No, not really, not in time.<br />-No, but we felt that it was important
8163384 8165802 -because we have a lot of...<br />-No, Frodo tells him.
8165886 8167986 At what...?<br />At what point does he tell him?
8170391 8174436 "You will never have it, and I'm here<br />to destroy it." And, you know…
8180067 8184905 It sort of just is a bit weird because<br />Gollum would be so against destroying it.
8185072 8187365 But Gollum is not sure why they want<br />to go to Mordor,
8187449 8189868 and he's just leading them there.<br />But obviously just with the hope
8189952 8192287 at one point... At some point<br />he's going to snatch the Ring.
8192371 8197126 But he's not entirely sure why they<br />want to go, and he doesn't ask.
8197293 8198627 Well, they don't tell him.
8198794 8202130 But there has to be that moment where he<br />realizes what Frodo is going to do.
8202214 8205634 And he realizes that the Ring,<br />the actual existence of the Ring
8205801 8209847 not just for himself, but the existence<br />is in jeopardy, is in danger
8210014 8213392 because Frodo is now bent<br />on destroying it.
8214643 8218188 I always liked this moment, and we<br />didn't actually have Cate Blanchett
8218272 8221317 with us at the time that we<br />shot Elijah in the forest.
8221483 8223818 That's a real forest on the South Island,<br />and we did it as a pickup,
8223902 8229616 so we used one of our focus pullers,<br />Jac Fitzgerald.
8229783 8235622 She put on Galadriel's costume, and<br />it's her... It's her that's standing here.
8235789 8239918 And this is obviously a shot of Cate<br />Blanchett we did a long time earlier.
8240085 8242838 But we used Jac for the person
8243005 8247092 who actually reaches down<br />and offers her hand.
8248635 8250637 We felt it was important to remind people
8250721 8253682 that Galadriel was entrusting<br />this mission to Frodo.
8253849 8256935 And it was just a way of re-motivating<br />Frodo, wasn't it?
8257102 8259479 -I love it. It's...<br />-Taking him from the point of despair
8259563 8262358 into re-energizing him back<br />on his mission again.
8268530 8271241 He has to keep going.<br />And she's kind of saying to him:
8271909 8274661 "You can't do this.<br />You have to keep going."
8286006 8289551 It's just a moment that further develops<br />the friendship
8289718 8292554 between Éowyn and Merry,<br />and tells us something
8292721 8295932 about what these characters are feeling<br />on the eve of their own battle
8296016 8297851 that they're heading towards.
8306026 8307945 -Yeah.<br />-I like their performances.
8308112 8312658 It's just unfortunate that... That in<br />terms of the narrative momentum
8312825 8315494 it sort of slowed things down<br />at a time when
8315661 8318330 we couldn't afford to have it<br />in the theatrical.
8318497 8320332 -No.<br />-It was really nice.
8324920 8329258 -...between her and Merry.<br />-Yeah.
8329425 8332425 It's also when she says.<br />"Courage, Merry, for our friends"
8332553 8337641 before she rides into battle.<br />She's actually referencing this moment.
8344148 8347317 I like that scene too, because the look<br />in there... What Dominic does
8347401 8350737 with that performance is...<br />Earns that great line that Théoden says.
8350821 8353699 He's terrified, but he's going<br />into battle nonetheless.
8353866 8356785 And they realize that he's... This<br />little Hobbit is absolutely terrified,
8356869 8358787 but that he's gonna go and fight anyway.
8358871 8361957 And I think that's what that moment<br />is about as well.
8367129 8369881 Hopefully it doesn't look like we did,<br />but it was used extensively
8369965 8373302 in <i>Two Towers,</i> obviously,<br />for all the Rohan, the Warg battle,
8373469 8375428 and the refugees moving<br />across the mountains.
8375512 8379475 A great location.<br />It's out of Queenstown, in New Zealand.
8381810 8384980 So returning to our medieval history,<br />these are now catapults
8385147 8387232 as opposed to trebuchets.
8387399 8391653 And Geoff Murphy shot a lot of this<br />fireball stuff, didn't he
8391820 8394656 -the fireballs landing in the city?<br />-Yes, it was.
8394823 8396617 Done on our set.
8398327 8401277 -Is that all CGI there? That's all...<br />-That's all CGI, yeah.
8402748 8404958 We often shot the miniature Minas Tirith,
8405125 8407920 and then we projected<br />the miniature footage
8408086 8413717 onto a computer model of the city,<br />so we could get some different angles,
8413884 8416344 and slightly different camera moves<br />if we had to.
8416428 8417846 Grond is a big miniature
8418096 8419746 that is about 8 or 9 foot long.
8421558 8426438 And this... This set, which was<br />the Court of the Kings
8426605 8428398 was actually right next to<br />a railway station.
8428482 8432778 It was built basically in the same<br />parking lot as the Osgiliath ruins,
8432945 8437783 and our wet set was built,<br />out in the Hutt Valley, Wingate.
8440619 8446792 Now we're finally getting to put<br />Faramir's life in jeopardy again.
8446959 8448585 Oh, this is a new shot, the tree.
8448669 8450795 We never quite figured out how<br />to use the tree in the movie,
8450879 8454675 but that shot of the bloom<br />was supposed to be just a clue
8454841 8456676 wasn't it, that the king was returning.
8456760 8459679 And no matter what Denethor was doing,<br />or thought he was doing
8459763 8463013 there was no way he could stop<br />the inevitability of the fate
8463517 8465435 of that fact that Aragorn was now<br />heading back there.
8465519 8468188 It's almost like he's...<br />Aragorn commands the ghost army
8468272 8470732 he's heading towards<br />Minas Tirith, and so the tree
8470816 8473443 just pops out one little flower, so...<br />Pop.
8473610 8475560 -And...<br />-It seems a bit premature to me.
8476071 8478781 -Yeah. Well, the tree...<br />-It's a beautiful moment. I like it.
8478865 8480701 -It's an optimistic tree.<br />-It is.
8483328 8485163 "...so I might just have one little<br />flower come out."
8485247 8487916 But we never quite figured out... I don't<br />know quite what the rules of the tree are,
8488000 8490600 and aren't, and it doesn't<br />really matter, does it?
8501013 8503139 ...in such a way that you had<br />to cross this viaduct...
8503223 8505683 ...this bridge, to go to what was<br />essentially the cemetery...
8505767 8507727 ...which was on the mountainside<br />at the back of the city.
8507811 8510230 And something just wonderful<br />about the tombs and graveyards.
8510314 8512065 I remember in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>
8512149 8515694 we had the Dwarf graveyard and Moria.<br />And you have this old tombs.
8515861 8520657 In fact, in <i>Kong</i> we're planning on having<br />a big graveyard cemetery on Skull Island.
8520824 8523201 And they're gonna come across it.<br />Something evocative,
8523285 8525412 and spooky about this.
8538717 8541719 The Wargs are quite subtle.<br />You don't really see them that much.
8541803 8544556 They're in a few shots, but the trolls<br />obviously are a bit more noticeable.
8544640 8548059 So these shots were done very quickly.<br />They were done in, like, the last
8548143 8551772 two, three, four weeks of<br />post-production on the film.
8551938 8556568 We had some plates, and some of<br />the plates were not shot with the idea
8556735 8560405 of putting trolls into them. But we<br />managed to squeeze trolls in nonetheless,
8560489 8563950 and just make it seem<br />like that all of the forces of Mordor
8564117 8568330 were just rampaging into the city.<br />Make it as desperate as possible.
8568497 8572501 It was one of those sequences where we<br />didn't have... We didn't really shoot it
8572668 8575629 in an incredibly planned kind of way.
8575796 8577996 But it... It... We managed<br />to take the shots,
8578507 8581207 and put them together<br />in a reasonably good sequence.
8582302 8585096 I wanted Shelob to be very old.<br />I wanted her to be ancient.
8585180 8588933 That was the idea with all the growths and<br />the sort of little tumor-y kind of things
8589017 8591436 on her face, just to make her feel<br />like she's been around,
8591520 8593146 for God knows how long.
8603573 8605283 -It's a great shot.<br />-Which was an idea we had on the set.
8605367 8607828 We were playing around<br />with the wide-angle lens,
8607994 8610747 and the camera on a crane, and we<br />were just looking for interesting angles.
8610831 8613082 And we came up with this angle, we...<br />And then we decided
8613166 8616169 to make it... To really<br />feature it as a shot.
8617713 8620214 This is an image that's off<br />one of Alan Lee's paintings, isn't it
8620298 8625137 off... On <i>The Two Towers</i> cover.<br />Looking up the staircase.
8625303 8627639 But I like the fact that the spider<br />is being really creepy,
8627723 8633228 and sneaky and spooky. And this...<br />This is the one that gets a great gasp.
8636690 8639317 And Elijah was great. They gave him<br />some Alka-Seltzer tablets
8639401 8642863 which he had in his mouth,<br />which is what creates the foam
8643029 8644864 that he put two of these big tablets<br />in his mouth,
8644948 8647784 and just worked up all the foam<br />and just squeezed out
8647868 8651121 the... The saliva at the right time.
8651288 8657669 And Frodo has become a digital<br />double here, the CG version of Frodo.
8658962 8661506 Now, the hand that comes in here<br />when Sam appears
8661590 8664133 is actually not Sean Astin's hand.<br />We won't... We won't talk about
8664217 8665760 whose hand it is,<br />but I guess if you watch...
8665844 8668694 If you watch the documentary material,<br />you might find out.
8670140 8672183 This was tough for Sean.<br />Because, obviously
8672267 8675917 like any of these monster fights,<br />you know, you're reacting to nothing.
8676021 8679941 And this... This fight was shot back<br />in principal photography,
8680108 8682318 and we really didn't know what<br />Shelob was gonna look like.
8682402 8684613 In fact, Shelob was designed<br />at the very end.
8684780 8687865 I mean, all the way through the shooting,<br />we never had Shelob...
8687949 8690034 Even a drawing of Shelob,<br />particularly, and...
8690118 8694122 And we only really worked on<br />her design this last 12 months.
8694289 8697542 Sean was literally just going for it<br />and not having a clue
8697709 8701421 what he was really reacting to<br />or acting against.
8706802 8710639 ...that he grabbed hold of, so we could<br />see his hands grabbing something.
8710806 8713806 -But they weren't mandibles.<br />-Some of this... This was later.
8714476 8717353 -This was shot in pickup.<br />-A couple of these shots were later, yeah.
8717437 8720649 And that's a transfer from<br />a digital double to Sean Astin
8720816 8722817 where it's a digital double rolling<br />off the back,
8722901 8726571 and then when he lands,<br />we do a little morph into the real actor.
8730325 8732410 I thought the animators did<br />a great job with this
8732494 8735079 after the stab. I mean, that looks<br />like a real wounded spider.
8735163 8737663 Not that I've ever seen<br />a spider wounded like that.
8744965 8748718 ...who were concentrating on...<br />On Shelob...
8748969 8752472 -...that really managed to capture...<br />-It's genius.
8752848 8756685 ...a good spider. I just wanted it<br />to feel like a real spider too.
8756852 8760689 That it wasn't one of those<br />kind of movie, robotic things.
8760856 8762691 I wanted it to scuttle and move.
8762858 8764359 It moves fast. It moves slow.
8764526 8769865 It does... You know, it's totally motivated<br />by what... By what she's trying to achieve.
8785255 8788758 -Sort of. They're related to her.<br />-They all descended off the same...
8788925 8792220 -Ungoliant.<br />-Ungoliant, who was with Shelob when...
8792387 8794972 -I don't even know how to say it.<br />-Is that sort of <i>The Silmarillion?</i>
8795056 8797517 -Like a sort of... That was the...<br />-She's a Maiar.
8798727 8801271 -That was a god...<br />-Like the Balrog, yeah.
8804900 8806609 -She's a descendant, yeah.<br />-...off of her, yeah.
8806693 8810093 So Shelob is a descendant and the<br />ones in <i>The Hobbit</i> are descendants.
8811489 8815660 Shelob, she's more, you know,<br />of this world.
8824753 8829132 I don't know how he went to the toilet,<br />but he couldn't go to the toilet.
8829299 8831468 Not that I was aware of. He was...
8831635 8834011 He was literally wrapped up<br />in this stuff in the morning,
8834095 8836765 and had to just sort of...<br />Because it was just...
8836932 8839517 It took so long, and we couldn't<br />sort of slip him in and out of it.
8839601 8843396 He was just bundled up like this<br />for a long, long time.
8844606 8847025 He couldn't even scratch his nose.
8852447 8855408 So was this Sean Astin's audition scene,<br />wasn't it?
8858536 8860330 And, actually, Sean struggled.
8860497 8863374 I was a bit dubious, I remember,<br />how he would handle the English stuff.
8863458 8865376 Actually, what was funny was<br />a lot of the English actors
8865460 8867879 who were auditioning found this<br />scene really hard.
8867963 8870131 Sean Astin just nailed it.
8870799 8872801 It was really moving.
8884813 8888233 Steven has played Orcs before for us.<br />He was...
8888400 8890443 He did a couple of Orcs in<br /><i>The Two Towers.</i>
8890527 8892946 And Peter Tait is actually<br />the Corsair captain
8893113 8895907 the guy sitting on the bridge<br />of the Corsair ship.
8896074 8900453 And he did this other role for us.<br />Obviously, in makeup, as the Uruk-hai.
8908420 8910296 Always difficult to make<br />these Orcs feel real,
8910380 8912674 but I really like what Steven does.
8913633 8916427 And this is pretty much the moment<br />that <i>The Two Towers</i> novel
8916511 8918561 actually ends, isn't it, with Frodo
8918680 8920432 -being carried away?<br />-Yes. Yes.
8920598 8923184 So if you were being strictly accurate<br />to the book
8923268 8925718 that would have been<br />the end of <i>The Two Towers.</i>
8930692 8933486 "The Choices of Master Samwise."
8946791 8949335 ...on the top of the pyre,<br />that we thought to save him...
8949419 8953256 ...having to spend literally days and days<br />just lying on top of a pyre...
8953423 8956634 And of course there was situations where<br />there were going to be flames as well
8956718 8959428 that we built a dummy. And a<br />lot of the shots that you're seeing
8959512 8962139 are actually the silicone dummy.<br />The very big close-ups of his face
8962223 8964934 are the real David Wenham. Anything<br />that's not in a big close-up is...
8965018 8968563 Is this incredibly realistic dummy<br />that we just used to save him the...
8968730 8971066 The trouble of having to lie there.
8974986 8976821 Yeah, that was a little in-camera cheat...
8976905 8979805 -That's really clever.<br />-...because we had... We had Kiran…
8981951 8984954 Already in position, so he could<br />just pop up at the right time.
8985038 8986706 Actually it was Fon.<br />It was Fon that got...
8986790 8989840 Another one of our scale doubles<br />that actually got thrown out.
8990126 8992176 -She always did Pippin, didn't she?<br />-Yeah.
8998510 9000970 ...amongst the big people is usually Fon.
9001137 9004641 And Kiran did Frodo pretty much,<br />didn't he? Yeah.
9005642 9008519 Billy worked very closely with Fon,<br />who was a female, a lady.
9008603 9011189 And Billy really got on well with her,
9011356 9015068 and instructed her how to walk<br />like him and perform like him.
9015235 9016736 And she was very, very good.
9016903 9020031 Some of these shots of Gandalf<br />were little pickups that we did.
9020281 9022867 Because we had all these wonderful,<br />big wide shots
9022951 9027789 great, you know, vistas, but we didn't<br />really have much coverage of Ian himself,
9027956 9030125 so we set up a little shoot,
9030291 9034462 and did some close-ups of him<br />giving orders and instructions.
9034629 9037214 Then we shot some of these<br />big miniature shots, which were
9037298 9040969 again, to make the...<br />Break the picture open.
9042137 9044887 This little sequence here was one<br />where we added trolls.
9044973 9048601 They were all shots that were done<br />never intending for trolls to be in them.
9048685 9051437 But I gave them to Weta, and I said,<br />"Can you just sneak me in a troll
9051521 9054983 "here and there?" And you'll see a<br />few shots coming through here
9055150 9061197 where we do... We do just sneak in<br />the occasional CG monster.
9066035 9071332 It was important in the story to try to build<br />the despair, to try to really make it seem
9071499 9074711 like this battle was really...<br />Was turning into a defeat
9074878 9076962 that it was... They were on the back foot
9077046 9081509 the Gondorians and Gandalf,<br />and that it was fairly hopeless
9081676 9085638 because it gives a value, obviously.<br />To the arrival of Théoden.
9092145 9096024 ...with the Extended Cut.<br />The Extended Cut changes the story.
9096191 9097942 It does a little bit, yeah.
9098109 9101404 We always thought Gandalf<br />would react to this showdown
9101571 9104532 with the Witch-king, and that the...
9104699 9106826 The Rohirrim would turn up<br />at that moment.
9109037 9110663 -Yes.<br />-...in our script, and we altered it,
9110747 9113791 for the theatrical version, but...<br />You know, the confrontation with
9113875 9116585 the Witch-king was something... I<br />can't remember why we didn't put it in
9116669 9119469 -the theatrical version.<br />-Because it didn't ever work.
9121466 9124116 It's... In the book it works on<br />a different level and…
9126846 9130396 About a character who arrives,<br />threatens to do something, and then
9130516 9133561 flies away again, having not actually...
9133728 9137190 Well, he broke Gandalf's staff,<br />but there was just the sense...
9137357 9140860 Made him less frightening.<br />And less potent as a character.
9141069 9143445 It was like an event that threatened<br />to happen but then didn't.
9143529 9146532 And we really felt it<br />in the pacing of the film.
9148785 9150411 ...and more kind of exciting.
9152038 9155588 -"I'm gonna wait to kill you, even though..."<br />-"I'll come back to you."
9158878 9162507 I mean, I like the stuff on Mount Doom<br />with Frodo and Sam.
9162674 9167262 But for some reason, this scene,<br />I feel most proud of this scene.
9168930 9172892 It's weird where things happen, because,<br />you know, this is obviously in the book,
9172976 9174351 and it's something that we<br />were working on.
9174435 9177104 I remember when we were<br />working on the script for this
9177188 9180566 when we were writing the script for<br />Miramax. It would have been about 1997.
9180650 9183444 I remember on a Sunday afternoon we took
9183611 9187448 our kids out to their grandparents...<br />Out to my mother and father's house.
9187615 9192453 And I remember going for a quiet<br />walk in their garden by myself.
9192620 9196457 And this scene, which I guess we must<br />have just been writing at that time...
9196624 9199085 This scene just played itself<br />out in my head,
9199252 9202213 and I suddenly got the idea<br />for all the different shots,
9202297 9205633 and all the angles and all the moments.<br />Just sort of the whole scene
9205717 9208636 came together in that garden.
9208803 9211639 And I just hung on to that memory.
9211806 9214892 I didn't write it down.<br />I just had it ingrained in my head.
9215059 9219981 It was about four years later that I was<br />actually in Twizel, in the South Island
9220148 9224902 shooting the scene. And then another<br />three years after I shot it
9225069 9227404 before it was actually<br />released in the movie.
9227488 9232702 I just have... This particular scene has<br />this long gestation.
9232869 9235663 For that reason I'm very fond of it.
9237415 9240417 It was Bernard's idea... Bernard<br />Hill's idea, who's playing Théoden
9240501 9244839 to do this rattle along the spears.<br />This was an idea that came late.
9245006 9247800 And it happened...<br />Virtually, you know, for me
9247967 9251762 it was something Bernard suggested just<br />before we were due... Due to shoot it.
9251846 9255391 He'd come up with the idea of riding<br />along and... And... And dragging
9255558 9257851 the sword along the spears.<br />He thought it was almost
9257935 9261188 like something that Théoden does<br />to raise the morale of his troops.
9261272 9263691 It was a really neat idea.<br />It was hard for Bernard to do
9263775 9266694 because he's left-handed.<br />And yet I wanted him to ride
9266778 9270030 towards the camera, so I remember<br />the look on his face, because he had
9270114 9273464 rehearsed it with the horses,<br />holding the sword in his left hand.
9273701 9275911 And I said, "Well, hang on, Bernard.<br />The camera is here.
9275995 9278790 The horses are here,<br />and if you use your left hand
9278956 9280791 you're gonna have to be<br />riding away from us.
9280875 9285380 But I want you riding towards us, because<br />that's how it's gonna look the best."
9285546 9288424 And so, suddenly,<br />he had to have the sword
9288591 9291802 in the hand he's not used to<br />holding it in, which really threw him.
9291886 9295681 But he managed to make it work very well.
9296391 9300060 And it also shows... I mean, from a purely<br />cinematic point of view, it shows
9300144 9303231 the scale of these horse charges.<br />This is 6000 horses
9303398 9306066 which is exactly what Tolkien<br />describes in the book.
9306150 9309278 And interestingly, you know, you see<br />6000 horses in those one or two
9309362 9312448 big wide shots that we have here.<br />And, interestingly enough, in...
9312532 9317412 In Napoleonic battles, the Battle of<br />Waterloo, the French heavy cavalry
9317578 9320540 that charged the English was 6000
9320873 9322958 horses, exactly... Exactly the same size.
9323042 9327255 So this is historically what these<br />battles used to be like.
9327422 9330842 I mean, unbelievable seeing<br />6000 horses in one spot.
9334637 9335847 -Stunning.<br />-Yeah.
9336013 9338515 It works so beautifully<br />with the spirit of the charge.
9338599 9339892 Yeah.
9344772 9347274 ...up on the hill. And then from<br />the time the horses start charging...
9347358 9350736 ...Geoff Murphy did a lot of the shooting<br />of the actual horse charge...
9350820 9353197 ...which we're obviously tracking<br />vehicles with cameras in the back...
9353281 9355115 ...of the vehicle, driving at high speed.
9355199 9359787 We had to prepare a whole big field<br />in Twizel for the horses to get up on
9359954 9362664 because one of the most<br />dangerous things in scenes like this...
9362748 9365459 And it's gonna sound silly, but<br />you have to think about it for a moment
9365543 9367420 are actually rabbit holes.
9367587 9371215 That if you are out on the South Island of<br />New Zealand, there is a plague of rabbits.
9371299 9373300 And there were just<br />rabbit holes everywhere.
9373384 9375386 And you have horses galloping<br />at high speed
9375470 9379932 they put... One horse puts a foot down a<br />rabbit hole, one, you are going to injure
9380099 9383599 that horse terrifically. But if<br />you are in the middle of a charge
9383686 9386730 you are also gonna have all the<br />other horses piling up, and so
9386814 9390735 we had to be incredibly vigilant,<br />and we had to go over and over and over
9390902 9393946 this field with a fine-toothed comb<br />to make sure that all the rabbit holes
9394030 9396156 were filled in, because we<br />had to fill them in with dirt,
9396240 9397908 and prepare it. And it's dangerous.
9397992 9401913 It's very dangerous to be galloping<br />at a high speed like this.
9406584 9409086 Here's John back in his<br />Shakespearean mode.
9409253 9413966 He did very, very well in just<br />managing to get the fine balance
9414133 9418012 I think, between a... You know, a fully<br />Shakespearean-size performance,
9418179 9423226 and keeping some element of reality<br />to it. It was a real tough role to play.
9426687 9430037 -...over a very expensive wig.<br />-Well, that's right, and we didn't...
9432151 9434351 ...and do all that,<br />so we got it in one take.
9437073 9438699 Oh, it probably did.
9448876 9452004 None of this really is happening<br />in quite the way that you see it.
9452088 9456717 But if you look at the shot-by-shot, we<br />just edit together little tiny pieces
9456884 9459386 because it was dangerous, and there<br />was fire, and there were scale doubles,
9459470 9461805 and there were... You know,<br />there were all sorts of reasons
9461889 9466227 why this was real tough<br />to actually stage.
9468187 9470856 And so we never staged it<br />as a complete sequence.
9471023 9473901 We just did tiny pieces of it<br />and cut them together
9474068 9475986 which is all that<br />you have to do, obviously.
9476070 9478280 We added a few CG flames in.<br />Here and there,
9478364 9480575 but most of the flames<br />were actually real.
9485079 9488082 His father can look<br />into the eyes of that son,
9488249 9491961 and see his own failure,<br />and that for a parent like Denethor
9492128 9494922 it's like looking into a mirror<br />and receiving back
9495089 9497258 -the bad version of yourself.<br />-Yeah.
9500761 9503722 ...the horse rearing up,<br />kicking its hooves with nobody there.
9503806 9506016 And then as a separate pass.<br />We shot the stuntman being
9506100 9511731 jerked back onto the pyre.<br />And we combined the two elements.
9511897 9515109 And this was just another image<br />that I had in my head way back
9515276 9518613 at the very beginning.<br />As I just wanted the flaming Denethor
9518779 9521699 to jump off the prow of<br />the city and plummet, and now...
9521866 9525453 It could never happen in real life,<br />because the distance between
9525620 9528289 where the tomb is<br />and where the prow is, is so far.
9528456 9530457 He'd have to be running<br />about a mile to get there.
9530541 9531792 Poetic license.
9532126 9534526 Because I just liked the image<br />of him plummeting.
9539091 9544472 It was very hard from a stunt point of<br />view to actually shoot really good fighting
9544639 9548309 between horsemen and Orcs,<br />because it's just half the horses
9548476 9551979 shy away, and... You know,<br />from actually getting close to people,
9552146 9555232 and once you are waving spears<br />and swords around
9555399 9558569 it's just... It was always just... The<br />thing we had to do was just cutting it
9558653 9562323 very sharp and tight.<br />Because none of the actual fighting
9562490 9567536 we filmed was really that great.<br />We just had to fake it a wee bit.
9572333 9575377 Yeah, this was the scene that<br />I was really looking forward to doing.
9575461 9578964 I got to admit that if there was<br />one visual-effects sequence
9579131 9582831 in the entire <i>Lord of the Rings</i> that<br />I'd been waiting to do for years,
9582968 9585554 and years and years,<br />it was the mûmakil. It was this scene.
9585638 9587472 Because I... You know,<br />right at the beginning
9587556 9589266 when we first came up with the idea
9589350 9592937 of doing <i>Lord of the Rings,</i><br />I just was waiting to do this.
9593104 9595731 And I had to wait till the very end,<br />because we didn't...
9595815 9599765 We didn't really put this scene together<br />properly until the beginning of 2003
9599902 9602196 when we were in our post-production.
9603030 9606534 I wanted the tusks of the mûmakil<br />to be more than just sort of tusks.
9606701 9610037 I wanted them to have big, like,<br />maces swinging off chains,
9610329 9613790 and to be... You know, to have all sorts<br />of supplementary weapons on their tusks
9613874 9617962 like big iron spikes that they've<br />sort of put on there as well.
9624927 9629056 ...and... And in one of the earlier<br />versions there were so many shots...
9629223 9633185 ...of mûmakil taking arrows, that audience<br />sympathy was really with them.
9633352 9638232 I mean, you were really hating the Rohirrim<br />for wounding these animals. You really...
9638399 9641777 Well, when they would rear up,<br />and they would wave their paws around...
9641861 9643611 And there was just this sense of...
9645114 9648464 -Paws? Mûmakil don't have paws.<br />-No, I know... I know what you mean.
9649744 9651411 There were a few shots that made it look
9651495 9653595 like the mûmakil were really distressed.
9653748 9655707 And they were like circus...<br />Circus elephants.
9655791 9657292 I think it's because we're used to...
9657376 9659754 We're sort of programmed to be
9659920 9663090 a bit disgusted by the way<br />circus elephants are abused,
9663257 9666343 and they're whipped and they're made<br />to perform these silly tricks and things.
9666427 9669555 And it was feeling a bit like<br />a trained circus elephant
9669722 9672933 in some form of distress, wasn't it?<br />It was just... It was like...
9673017 9676717 It was pressing those buttons. It was<br />making you feel a bit sorry for them.
9680274 9681901 ...which was horrible.
9682067 9684217 But that... That one<br />didn't survive either.
9688115 9690815 ...in order to try to swing<br />the sympathy the other way.
9692411 9695289 ...because when you removed<br />those shots, it was fine.
9695456 9696956 I thought Shane was fantastic.
9697082 9698582 -The driver.<br />-Yeah, the driver.
9700795 9702963 ...and he's been doing stunts with us<br />since the very beginning.
9703047 9706633 This was just about the only time you<br />see him actually without an Orc mask on.
9706717 9708051 He's usually an Uruk-hai or an Orc.
9708135 9710679 But he has such a great presence<br />to play the driver,
9710763 9713891 and we thought Shane's<br />actually got the perfect face.
9716060 9718710 -Oh, that's a great pileup, isn't it, that one?<br />-Yeah.
9719438 9721064 ...or Miranda's stunt double on a horse...
9721148 9723984 ...and we put all the<br />battle action in afterwards.
9724151 9726069 We shot a lot of elements<br />of background horses
9726153 9728864 galloping left and right,<br />and we were able to take those,
9728948 9731825 and put them into all sorts of different<br />shots and build the battlefield up
9731909 9734536 add a lot of CG horses<br />and make it seem a lot busier.
9734620 9737914 If you look at these original plates<br />in the documentary on the green screen
9737998 9741710 that they're so much less spectacular<br />than what you're seeing here. It's...
9741794 9744629 It's amazing what you can do.<br />I just get excited by this stuff
9744713 9747925 because it opens up so many<br />possibilities for filmmakers
9748092 9750469 you know, that anything is possible now.
9751095 9753180 Once the mûmakil hits the ground here
9753347 9756642 it becomes a huge polystyrene<br />model that Richard Taylor made.
9756809 9760813 Which I think, if you ask Richard,<br />is probably about his proudest creation
9760980 9763565 in the entire experience of doing<br /><i>Lord of the Rings,</i> was the
9763649 9767361 full-sized mûmakil,<br />which he made for principal photography.
9767528 9769279 And we put it up in Queen Elizabeth Park.
9769363 9772032 And it's enormous, and then we...
9772199 9774451 There was talk about destroying it,<br />and I... And I said to them:
9774535 9777287 "Oh, I think we should just store it."<br />And they said, "Store it for what?"
9777371 9779331 You know, "We finished it, we filmed it."<br />And I said:
9779415 9781792 "Oh, you never know if we're<br />going to need it again." And then
9781876 9783960 sure enough, we dragged it out,<br />and we put it on our field
9784044 9786755 in the parking lot at Stone Street<br />for doing pickups.
9786839 9789800 And we did a lot of pickups with that...<br />With that mûmakil lying there
9789884 9791218 -didn't we?<br />-Yeah.
9791385 9795389 The entire Witch-king fight was shot there<br />and all the stuff with Éowyn fighting.
9795556 9798756 And now we've kept it,<br />because they said... After that they said:
9798893 9801311 "Oh, we should destroy it now,<br />shouldn't we?" And I said, "No, no, no.
9801395 9803595 I might want to put it<br />in my garden one day."
9805399 9807651 ...as opposed to painting it in later?
9812156 9815534 ...and it... It avoids having to edit<br />every single shot.
9815701 9817828 And it's also something<br />that people can jump around.
9817912 9821790 They can move around it. It<br />becomes... It becomes just part of a set.
9821957 9825335 You know, otherwise, you may as well<br />create everything on a computer.
9825419 9828419 You know, but you don't.<br />You build... You still build rooms
9829089 9831049 you still build pieces of set<br />for things to happen,
9831133 9833427 and it just became part of the set.
9842144 9845144 Now, this is an important scene<br />that was written as a pickup.
9848651 9851903 It's right at the end of <i>The Return<br />of the King</i> when Tolkien describes
9851987 9855574 what Frodo sees when<br />he's on the boat sailing out.
9855741 9859119 I always was very moved by it,<br />that it was completely pertinent
9859286 9862586 to have it in the story, not...<br />Not to have it just at the end
9862748 9864875 to give it a value to the characters
9865042 9868212 as the story was unfolding<br />and things were increasingly grim.
9868379 9871131 And this scene tells you<br />about Frodo's destiny.
9871548 9874551 So it has a... Has a good function<br />in terms of the storytelling.
9874635 9876428 Because when... When Frodo does leave
9876512 9878388 you have a sense of where...<br />To where he's going.
9878472 9880891 It's also quite nice to get<br />some relief from the battle,
9880975 9885688 and break away from the fighting<br />and come to look at the other side of it.
9888482 9891532 ...at the beginning of the year,<br />before we shot any pickups...
9891777 9893904 ...there was a sense that you last saw...
9894071 9897992 ...Gandalf and Pippin saving Faramir<br />from the funeral pyre...
9898450 9900744 ...and then you had this whole sequence<br />where the Rohirrim arrive...
9900828 9903288 ...they basically do what they're doing.<br />Aragorn arrives...
9903372 9906166 ...with the Army of the Dead,<br />and yet there's no...
9906333 9910086 There's... There's no reactions of Gandalf<br />or Pippin. They sort of disappear.
9910170 9912797 Somehow we wanted to see something<br />of their reaction to what was happening.
9912881 9914925 But... But this is great,<br />because it's not just...
9915009 9917909 It's not a literal reaction<br />to the events outside the city.
9919513 9922933 It's actually a continuation of what<br />they're experiencing within the city.
9923017 9924518 It's their darkest hour.
9929857 9931566 Pippin changes at the end of the scene.
9931650 9933569 Yeah.
9941452 9945205 And she would literally shoot these takes<br />until she could not stand up anymore
9945289 9947624 because she's not strong.<br />I mean, she was fit,
9947708 9949042 and she was great with the sword,
9949126 9951127 but she's obviously<br />not a tough stunt person.
9951211 9954548 And so we had these long fight routines.<br />And she would literally
9954715 9956800 get towards the end and collapse.<br />You could almost see
9956884 9960763 Miranda's batteries winding down<br />as her energy was sapping away
9960929 9962472 swinging and swinging and swinging.
9962556 9964641 And she ended up in tears<br />at the end of some of it.
9964725 9969730 She was just fighting so intensely<br />that she would bring herself to tears.
9969897 9972691 And we'd... And, you know, we'd stop<br />and we'd reset and she'd go again.
9972775 9975027 And she was just really brave.
9979114 9981533 She looked like she had been<br />beaten to a pulp.
9984244 9987580 ...with the Witch-king in his old helmet,<br />back in the days of principal photography.
9987664 9990334 And we made that decision<br />to redesign the helmet,
9990501 9993169 and that meant that we had to<br />basically reshoot the fight.
9993253 9996131 And we also changed the weapon too.<br />Because we...
9996298 9998598 We felt that the fight<br />wasn't that interesting.
10003430 10006016 ...because they knew you'd like it bigger.<br />And then when you saw it...
10006100 10008150 ...you wanted it 50 percent bigger again.
10010437 10013524 It looked like it could just<br />take off her head with one hit.
10013941 10017778 A lot of this stuff was just swinging<br />with a stick. He was holding a stick,
10017945 10021145 and the chain and the mace<br />was added in the computer later on.
10022574 10024451 It was always difficult to imagine<br />the... The...
10024535 10026703 The relationship between the river<br />and the docks and the city.
10026787 10028830 It was just one of those things<br />that you don't really think about.
10028914 10031249 But obviously it became<br />important to us to have to...
10031333 10033544 -To stage this stuff.<br />-Yeah.
10037881 10039591 -Joel Tolbeck plays him.<br />-Yes.
10039758 10042052 We... We used to nickname him<br />George, didn't we?
10042136 10045636 And we used to imagine that that<br />was possibly his mother's skull on it.
10051270 10053070 -She went everywhere with him.<br />-Yeah.
10059820 10061780 That's one of the weird things<br />with these extended cuts, isn't it?
10061864 10064908 You sometimes wonder whether<br />you're taking a backwards step.
10067536 10069913 Well, we have. We've seen<br />almost the same image, which is why
10069997 10071581 -we took it out of the theatrical version.<br />-Yeah.
10071665 10073667 -We just saved it for here.<br />-Yeah.
10079298 10081148 Meanwhile, back on Pelennor Fields...
10084887 10087637 This is a lot of people's<br />favorite moment in the book,
10087764 10090893 and a lot of people's<br />favorite moment in the movie.
10096690 10098692 She did. This gets a huge cheer.
10105782 10108368 Sometimes when you see a movie<br />for the first time with an audience
10108452 10111663 you really just don't know what's<br />going to happen at certain moments.
10111747 10113498 And we were always worried<br />that we didn't think
10113582 10115583 this was necessarily<br />as powerful as it should be.
10115667 10117917 But the cheering<br />that I heard in the cinema
10118045 10120672 it makes you feel good,<br />and you think, "Oh, okay, it works."
10120756 10122341 There's a huge sense of relief.
10124843 10127930 Viggo, in this fight scene here, it's...<br />The moment's passed,
10128096 10129973 but the first Orc that Viggo kills
10130057 10131891 -is actually his son. Henry.<br />-Henry.
10131975 10134311 But Henry played a young boy<br />at Helm's Deep
10134478 10135828 three or four years ago.
10135979 10139023 And... And here in pickups he was this...<br />He came back to New Zealand,
10139107 10140483 and he was, like, this young man.
10140567 10142110 -He's taller than his dad, isn't he?<br />-Yeah.
10142194 10144738 And so Viggo wanted<br />to use him in the movie.
10144905 10146657 And we stuck him in an Orc suit,
10146823 10149826 and he was actually part of the stunt<br />team. And he was... He took the first...
10149910 10152913 He was the first Orc that Aragorn<br />kills on Pelennor Fields.
10154414 10157083 This is a sequence that we obviously<br />didn't use in the theatrical cut,
10157167 10159252 but it was really just to<br />finish Gothmog off
10159336 10161045 that we felt we had<br />established this character,
10161129 10163798 and we wanted to give him a death,<br />and make it meaningful
10163882 10166885 to, you know, Éowyn,<br />who Gothmog has been attacking.
10169054 10172004 -We wanted Aragorn to save someone.<br />-And I like the irony...
10173392 10176937 He doesn't know, obviously,<br />that Éowyn is part of the battle.
10177396 10182484 Now, this was a scene that was created<br />just because of the fact
10182651 10186029 that Legolas' stunts in<br /><i>Fellowship</i> and <i>Two Towers</i>
10186196 10187947 had gone down so well with audiences.
10188031 10190992 And we actually didn't have<br />anything in <i>Return of the King</i> for him.
10191076 10194454 You know, we had had the skateboarding<br />down the Helm's Deep steps,
10194621 10197540 and the jumping on the horse and<br />the cave-troll stuff in <i>Fellowship.</i> And...
10197624 10200002 And we didn't have anything for...<br />For Legolas.
10200168 10203380 So seeing how well the other<br />scenes played, I...
10203547 10206507 I thought, "Okay, well, we've<br />gotta design something for him to do."
10206591 10208491 And the only thing I could think of
10208635 10211721 in terms of where he is in the story<br />was to give him something with a mûmakil.
10211805 10214766 And so we invented this whole sequence.
10214933 10218228 The Weta animation department<br />actually did a sort of animatic for me
10218312 10220647 before Orlando arrived<br />in New Zealand of what he could do.
10220731 10223900 So I was able to show Orlando, because<br />most of it's a computer Orlando.
10223984 10226134 There's obviously a few shots of the real
10226611 10228611 -Orly who we shot...<br />-That's real Orly.
10228739 10231491 And we shot this whole sequence<br />with Orly in one day.
10231658 10233827 We only had a day
10234244 10236996 because he was only in New Zealand...<br />He was shooting <i>Ned Kelly</i> in Australia
10237080 10239415 I think it was, wasn't it?<br />Or was he about to head off...
10239499 10241376 -Don't know.<br />-...to <i>Troy</i> or something? I can't...
10241460 10242836 -I can't remember.<br />-Yeah.
10243003 10245505 And he was only able<br />to be with us for three days,
10245589 10248633 and so we did the dri... We did the<br />drinking competition on one day
10248717 10250510 we did something else another day,<br />and we had one day
10250594 10252994 to shoot all of this<br />entire sequence with him.
10253680 10256600 Which we... Which we did<br />by planning it very carefully.
10268028 10271198 And this... This shot we did<br />deliberately to try to actually
10271365 10274368 explain the sort of dynamics<br />that the ghosts
10274534 10276661 are moving through. Killing all the Orcs.
10276745 10279706 Because you end up with a situation where<br />you've got so many Orcs everywhere
10279790 10282125 all the way through the city,<br />right the way to the very top
10282209 10286129 that we just had to somehow explain<br />why they suddenly all disappeared.
10286296 10290550 And the fact that the ghosts had<br />gone through and dealt with them all.
10295097 10298892 And this is a sequence that Fran<br />directed pretty much, didn't you?
10299059 10300894 I love this scene.
10301061 10303605 In fact, you re-shot it. We shot it once
10303772 10307526 in the principal photog...<br />Photography out at Queen Elizabeth Park.
10307692 10311071 And then we shot it again<br />with revised dialogue, didn't we?
10314241 10317327 Particularly it ended, actually,<br />as it does in the book, with him saying:
10317411 10320455 "I wish I could have seen<br />Éomer one last time."
10320622 10322457 And we felt that was sort of wrong,<br />didn't we?
10322541 10324491 -We had to redo it.<br />-Yes, that was, yes.
10324584 10326545 But it was also
10326711 10330507 which I really like,<br />which was the take Fran had on it
10330674 10332050 which is that
10332217 10335929 in the very first go-round<br />she was a lot more weepy
10336096 10337639 a lot more distraught.
10337806 10339724 But this feels a lot more real.
10344688 10346981 ...of <i>Return of the King,</i><br />and we gave him his farewell.
10347065 10351236 You know, we presented him a sword, and<br />we gave him a big speech and a party.
10351403 10355198 And then we decided that we wanted<br />to reshoot this after he had already left.
10355282 10358076 But fortunately he was on holiday<br />down in the South Island,
10358160 10360161 and hadn't actually left New Zealand yet.
10360245 10362873 And so we called him up and said,<br />"Look, we...
10363039 10365124 We gave you a farewell party<br />the other day,
10365208 10367877 but would you mind coming back<br />for just one more day of shooting?
10367961 10371089 Because we just would like<br />to do this extra scene."
10374301 10376928 We knew that they were<br />both up for it, and they... They really...
10377012 10380812 That's why you went there, which I thought<br />was such a cool thing to do, Pete.
10382267 10386146 It's his last scene that he ever shot<br />for <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>
10389441 10391692 It was really about<br />the bravery of her character,
10391776 10396907 and that... That she only cries<br />after he's gone. She wouldn't do that...
10397073 10399173 -Yeah.<br />-...you know, as... As he was dying.
10399618 10401495 So it didn't feel right. That we...
10401661 10404372 The earlier scene we had shot,<br />she was quite tearful all the way through.
10404456 10407006 And in a way,<br />it sort of wore itself out, didn't it?
10411004 10412589 That's what she tried to do.
10412756 10414674 -She tried to save him.<br />-Yes.
10426978 10431107 This scene was partially written<br />as a way of justifying
10431525 10434110 the obvious question. I mean, if I was<br />an audience member watching this
10434194 10437238 I'd be saying, "Well, they gotta<br />go in and take Mordor, right"
10437322 10439449 because they haven't killed Sauron.<br />So why don't they just keep
10439533 10441534 all these ghosts with them,<br />because the ghosts can't be killed.
10441618 10443661 And they can go and they can beat<br />any bad guy in the world
10443745 10445788 "if they've got this ghost army.<br />It's invincible."
10445872 10448040 And so we had to actually<br />get rid of the ghosts,
10448124 10451461 and we had to have Gimli<br />ask the audience question:
10451628 10453754 "Well, hang on, Aragorn,<br />I think these guys are pretty useful.
10453838 10455506 -Why don't we just hang on to them?"<br />-Yeah.
10455590 10459553 And Aragorn has made a vow<br />to release them if they help him.
10459719 10461304 And then the king is such a bastard.
10461388 10463890 The King of the Dead<br />is such a difficult guy
10464057 10465975 he doesn't want to do anything<br />for a noble reason
10466059 10467227 he just wants to...
10467435 10470188 Aragorn to fulfill his vow,<br />and he sort of puts it on Aragorn
10470272 10472023 to actually do the honorable thing,<br />which Aragorn...
10472107 10473483 -And he does.<br />-...promised he would.
10473567 10477362 And he... And he does. So we...<br />We wrote this as a way of justifying
10477529 10480829 what we thought was a tricky<br />little kind of story logic problem.
10482826 10485203 ...flying Frodo and the Ring<br />to Mount Doom.
10486580 10487705 -Yeah, Middle-earth taxi.<br />-Yeah.
10487789 10490000 As many people have said.
10491918 10494629 ...they would have been taken out<br />by the Nazgûl, the eagles.
10494713 10497213 -They couldn't have done it.<br />-When Frodo decided…
10500343 10501802 Why they didn't just summon up
10501886 10504736 Gwaihir the eagle and fly<br />to Mount Doom and drop it in.
10507309 10508768 Yeah, I know, I thought... I knew that.
10508852 10511146 -You knew that?<br />-I knew that.
10522991 10527287 Which, again, was only taken out purely for<br />pacing reasons, that we just felt that...
10527454 10529622 We were sort of panicking<br />a wee bit, I guess, not...
10529706 10531874 Not really knowing how the film<br />was going to play.
10531958 10534794 And we just wanted<br />to push forward to the climax
10534961 10538011 of the movie on Mount Doom<br />as quickly as we possibly could.
10540634 10543094 -...was emotionally drain you so that...<br />-Yeah, that's true.
10543178 10545028 But by the time you got to the end
10545138 10548600 you kind of were all emotioned out,<br />weren't you?
10548767 10552017 And the weight of the front of the movie<br />started to crush the end.
10556191 10559110 -And this is like the second night.<br />-Yeah.
10560820 10562489 It's Liv's song.
10565367 10567767 -And the singing by Liv.<br />-And the singing by Liv.
10570288 10571622 -...to images of herself.<br />-Yes.
10571706 10573333 -Yeah.<br />-I like it because
10573500 10576050 if you want to see it...<br />Arwen singing to Éowyn
10576169 10581466 that it's a shared understanding<br />of how painful it can be to love someone.
10585637 10588431 She's hitting notes there<br />that are really, really difficult.
10588515 10590141 She's got a beautiful voice, Liv.
10590225 10595689 And that was one of the things we wanted<br />to do, was to... Was to hear her sing.
10607158 10610202 And then in the Extended Cut<br />we've got exactly the same scene.
10610286 10612330 It hasn't changed, but it's now nighttime
10612414 10614314 which is what you can do with film.
10614416 10616417 You can fiddle with little buttons,<br />turn the knobs,
10616501 10620880 and either... Either make it day or night<br />now with computer-controlled color timing.
10621047 10623466 It's sort of... It's a bit less<br />important to know
10623550 10627200 what time of the day it is when<br />you're actually shooting it originally.
10629055 10630355 -During the cutting.<br />-Yeah.
10635061 10638231 ...was in or out, as to what time<br />of the... Of the day it was.
10638398 10641651 It works better as a nighttime scene.<br />Because it's much more poignant.
10641735 10644445 You can imagine that Pippin has been<br />searching for hours for Merry.
10644529 10646280 He knows he's there,<br />and he just can't find him
10646364 10648240 because there's thousands<br />of bodies on the battlefield.
10648324 10650974 -So it has that poignancy, which is nice.<br />-And this...
10654164 10655414 This is the moment where we see
10655498 10657584 -that Pippin has grown up.<br />-Yeah.
10661880 10665091 I was always fascinated by the way<br />that Tolkien would describe these
10665175 10668177 particular structures as... As having<br />been built by the Númenóreans.
10668261 10670930 You know, they were good-guy towers.
10671097 10674642 Both Minas Morgul and Cirith Ungol<br />were... Were forts...
10674809 10678104 Fortresses that were built by the...<br />The Gondorians
10678271 10681524 essentially, in the old days, and they<br />had been taken over by the Orcs.
10681608 10683359 So I always liked the idea.
10683526 10686279 It gave us a lot of fun<br />with the design of the places
10686446 10689574 to make it seem like<br />they had been occupied by Orcs
10689741 10692786 who have put some<br />of their own architectural
10692952 10697957 style into the buildings, whacking on bits<br />of iron and rusty spikes on all the parapets.
10706466 10707801 -Is it?<br />-Yeah.
10712305 10714555 -Does his wig really fall off?<br />-Yeah, it does.
10715642 10716809 -Whereabouts? Let's just watch.<br />-There.
10716893 10719395 -Is it?<br />-Yes, it's in that toss across.
10719562 10720647 -Oh, is it?<br />-Yeah.
10724317 10726367 ...and go back<br />and check it out right now.
10727445 10729905 The fight scene here. We've<br />extended this a little... Little bit.
10729989 10732339 This was trimmed down<br />in the theatrical version.
10732492 10735942 Because it is... It's gratuitous,<br />and it's kind of a little bit silly.
10736496 10738080 -How can you say that?<br />-Probably more than
10738164 10740499 a little bit silly, but I...<br />I always quite liked it.
10740583 10742585 We had a lot of fun shooting it.<br />Just these guys
10742669 10744044 bashing the hell out of each other.
10744128 10747423 So I put a little bit more of it<br />back in the extended version.
10750885 10752136 Which is... It's a little bit silly
10752220 10753345 -in the book as well.<br />-Yeah.
10753429 10757029 It's slightly unbelievable, and it's very<br />convenient, because it means
10757183 10760853 that all the baddies are dead by the<br />time Sam has to go in and find Frodo.
10760937 10763272 Otherwise... It was almost like<br />Tolkien figuring out a way of
10763356 10766776 how... How on earth do I get Sam<br />into the tower? And he had to invent
10766860 10769195 a rationale.<br />Which would create the place...
10769362 10771562 -You know, mean the place was empty.<br />-He did.
10771656 10774450 The problem with a scene like this<br />is that once you have your bad guys
10774534 10778120 beating the hell out of each other,<br />they stop becoming a potent force.
10778204 10780354 -Well, they never win.<br />-They don't ever win.
10781374 10782924 -Yeah.<br />-They never hit anything.
10783084 10785920 Thousands of them get killed, and they...<br />They're sort of threatening,
10786004 10788339 but they never actually<br />deliver the goods.
10789883 10795054 We did have a... A bit with Sam<br />going past the Watchers too.
10795221 10798599 The Watchers are those statues at the<br />Gate who are meant as sort of a weird
10798683 10802979 kind of a psychic barrier<br />that he has to break through.
10803855 10806065 Which I thought about putting in the...<br />The Extended Cut.
10806149 10809318 And I ultimately didn't, because<br />it does slow the pace down a wee bit.
10809402 10813072 But maybe one day for<br />the 25th anniversary edition we can...
10813239 10815889 We can put that in.<br />We'll keep that one up our sleeve.
10817118 10819495 I've always quite liked this moment.<br />It's another slightly silly...
10819579 10821622 There's a bit of silliness<br />around Cirith Ungol,
10821706 10825501 but, you know, these guys thinking<br />that some huge, big muscular superhero
10825585 10828337 is coming up the stairs, and then<br />they found out that it's just little Sam.
10828421 10829880 This was just about the only time that...
10829964 10832716 That Sean ever got to actually do<br />any fighting with his sword.
10832800 10836679 You know, he... He was in three movies,<br />and he did sword training,
10836846 10839599 and he was so into<br />wanting to be the hero.
10839766 10842560 And, like, this...<br />This little fight was about it,
10843061 10846021 and most of it was done by Kiran,<br />the little scale double.
10846105 10849955 I mean, Sean got to do... Swing a sword<br />around about three times in close-ups.
10853154 10856240 The mithril vest shot is another little<br />addition that we did, because obviously
10856324 10859827 we were adding in a subplot that we<br />took out of the theatrical version
10859911 10862955 which is about the mithril vest.<br />It pays off with the Mouth of Sauron
10863039 10865457 who is a character you'll see<br />coming up shortly.
10865541 10869003 Cirith Ungol was a miniature about<br />12 foot tall. I really like the miniature.
10869087 10871463 We've... We've hung on to that one,<br />because it's a beautiful big model.
10871547 10874008 Just have to build<br />a big enough room to put it in.
10880473 10884060 Steven Ure is... is a really great Orc.<br />He was one of our favorite Orcs.
10884227 10889440 And as I said earlier, he sort of appeared<br />as several Orcs over the trilogy.
10892610 10894320 He's from Orc-land.
10898449 10900326 ...almost two years before the film<br />was gonna come out.
10900410 10903704 And <i>Empire</i> magazine had just put<br />a picture of Frodo on the front cover,
10903788 10905414 and it was the first time<br /><i>Lord of the Rings</i>
10905498 10907416 had ever had a cover photo<br />on any magazine.
10907500 10910794 This was the day we were shooting this<br />scene, and everyone crowded around.
10910878 10914006 And we were so excited that... That<br />there was an image from the movie
10914090 10915841 that we were still<br />in the middle of shooting.
10915925 10918761 It was... Had actually started<br />to pop up on a magazine cover.
10918845 10920846 It was sort of a really, kind of...<br />Those things
10920930 10923933 give you a bit of a morale boost,<br />especially when you're a year into
10924017 10926144 shooting a difficult movie.
10926894 10930064 In the book, Sam puts the Ring on,<br />doesn't he, at one stage
10930231 10933067 just prior...? Earlier than this.<br />Which was something we avoided, that...
10933151 10935528 -Didn't we, in the script?<br />-Yeah. It was…
10938865 10941116 The thought was very late in coming to us
10941200 10944078 on how to shape this scene, wasn't it?<br />And in the end, we...
10944162 10946289 It was a bit of a salvage in ADR.
10946456 10951627 But we... At this stage,<br />we were playing Frodo the...
10951794 10957175 First off, we were playing Frodo's<br />relief and in... And... And intense need
10957341 10959761 almost a junkie's need,<br />to get the Ring back.
10959927 10963389 But we pulled back on that<br />because we also realized this scene
10963556 10967435 needed to show, actually,<br />the opposite. It needed to show
10967602 10971189 that Sam could so easily<br />and so quickly go there.
10971355 10973816 And that by taking it back,<br />Frodo was helping him.
10976694 10979321 ...he was actually doing it<br />to save Sam and to help Sam.
10979405 10981115 -We'd seen the junkie...<br />-So it gave Frodo
10981199 10982950 a heroic kind of moment.
10983117 10985577 And that was only done with the way<br />that we cut it together.
10985661 10987287 -Like, it wasn't shot that way.<br />-No.
10987371 10990583 But we just kept cutting back<br />to more shots of Sam waiting
10990750 10992334 which were from all different takes.
10992418 10994837 Because he... He wasn't waiting<br />for so long in the original take,
10994921 10998465 but we took a... A bit of waiting from<br />take two, a bit of waiting from take three
10998549 11001176 a bit of waiting from take four,<br />stitched them all together,
11001260 11003429 so that we... We were able<br />to create this feeling
11003513 11005139 that he wasn't handing the Ring over.
11005223 11007516 Because in the original performance,<br />he just... He just says:
11007600 11009351 "Give me the Ring,"<br />and Sam just hands it to him.
11009435 11011835 It was like there was no tension<br />at all in there.
11015775 11017443 There was... And... And the hesitation<br />was actually concern at Frodo's state
11017527 11020279 not actually his own desire<br />to keep the Ring
11020446 11022614 which actually you've managed<br />to construct really well there,
11022698 11024325 so it was a good save.
11024492 11026994 Because, originally, I think we...
11027161 11029664 It was one of those things<br />where we actually
11029831 11034127 realized we'd played the junkie beat<br />through in... In <i>Two Towers,</i> hadn't we?
11034293 11037922 By the time we got to <i>The Two Towers</i><br />pickups, we'd... We'd done that.
11038089 11041425 And at this stage, Frodo's fully<br />aware of the evil of the Ring,
11041592 11044470 and he also knows it's gonna kill Sam.
11048516 11050643 ...because he turned away from Sam...
11050810 11052645 -...when he should not have.<br />-Yeah.
11052812 11057400 But has learned from that and knows<br />what Sam must now turn away from.
11061404 11064031 -...and that's Frodo must carry that thing.<br />-It's a... It's a redeeming moment for him.
11064115 11065074 -It is.<br />-Yeah.
11065158 11066408 I wish we'd had that thought, though
11066492 11068892 because I think we could've<br />written it better.
11069996 11071038 -Yeah.
11071205 11073905 -But... But we did okay in the end.<br />-We got through it.
11076419 11077920 -Yeah.<br />-This was the last day of shooting.
11078004 11082133 This was done in the morning on our very<br />last day of principal photography.
11084177 11087927 -...was him putting on the coat, wasn't it?<br />-Which I never put in the movie.
11090474 11092601 And it doesn't appear<br />in the Extended Cut either.
11092685 11095020 This sequence replaces the one<br />in the tent
11095104 11096814 because that was another thing<br />that was in the book
11096898 11100776 that didn't quite work, we felt, in<br />the film, is that we're establishing...
11100943 11104279 You know, we've spent so long with<br />Aragorn making his way to Minas Tirith
11104363 11106115 that in the book, of course,<br />he gets there, and he says:
11106199 11109749 "Well, I can't enter the city,<br />because I'm not king yet." is that right?
11114415 11116875 ...and too difficult for us<br />to get into in the film.
11116959 11119587 So this... This council of war<br />happens in the book,
11119754 11122804 but it happens on a tent<br />on the remains of the battlefield.
11128971 11133017 ...and the ride of the knights of Dol<br />Amroth is a great moment in the book...
11133184 11137230 ...but we just could not bring a new<br />character in at this moment into the story.
11139732 11143527 Arnold Schwarzenegger.<br />"I am Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth.
11143694 11145362 I've come to help you with my knights."
11145446 11147990 -What are you doing?<br />-I don't know.
11148157 11150107 -This is what we have to deal with.<br />-No.
11150201 11154038 "I am Prince Imrahil of Dol Amroth."<br />He's got a great name.
11154205 11156790 It's a shame. Because that was one<br />of the cool things in the book, is that
11156874 11160127 a few people turn up from<br />different outlying counties
11160294 11162337 don't they, to come to Minas Tirith<br />to help in the battle,
11162421 11165549 and to bolster up the armies, and...<br />That was in one of our earlier scripts.
11165633 11168761 Prince Imrahil was in our Miramax draft,<br />if I remember rightly.
11168928 11171681 He... He was there for a while.<br />He made his appearance.
11172473 11173474 Yeah.
11173766 11176018 This was a scene that<br />we didn't use in the movie.
11176102 11178187 It's kind of cool. We just liked the idea
11178271 11181857 because, of course.<br />We were in our time-crunching mode
11182024 11185402 we thought it was a great cut to go<br />from Gimli saying his little line about:
11185486 11188530 "What are we waiting for?"<br />Which was a... A John Rhys-Davies ad-lib.
11188614 11190157 And then cut straight to Viggo
11190241 11192952 with the crown on his chest<br />marching out to war.
11193119 11197623 And that was just a real tempting jump cut<br />to make that pushed the movie along,
11197790 11201627 and got you really going. But this is<br />how we originally conceived the sequence
11201711 11204964 which was to be challenging Sauron.
11205131 11206590 Which is obviously... It's irrelevant.
11206674 11210803 It's more relevant to some degree<br />in the fact that when we shot this
11210970 11215308 we had already filmed Aragorn<br />and Sauron actually fighting outside
11215474 11218101 the Black Gate.<br />So this was the personal challenge
11218185 11220313 that was gonna bring Sauron to the Gate.
11220479 11223232 And it... It still works in the context<br />of the film
11223399 11224442 -because...<br />-Yep.
11224608 11226610 Because he's basically challenging<br />Sauron's armies
11226694 11228794 to come out to meet them, which is fine.
11232491 11234118 -And there's the dream.<br />-Yeah.
11235703 11237103 Yeah, so it's... It's there.
11238998 11241417 Different momentum to this part<br />of the film now.
11241584 11244503 And different motivation, actually,<br />for Sauron.
11261562 11263856 And it's good to have this stuff<br />back in too.
11264023 11268069 It's one of those difficult situations<br />where you're taking two characters,
11268235 11270696 and having them fall in love<br />very quickly.
11270863 11273949 And... And we did shoot these scenes,<br />but I guess we just decided
11274033 11275200 in the theatrical cut of...
11275284 11278120 Of, you know, we had to just stick with<br />our main central characters
11278204 11280956 which at this point in time,<br />were really Aragorn and his gang,
11281040 11286754 and Frodo and Sam. And we...<br />We had to just exclude other plot lines
11286921 11289965 because we felt we wanted to<br />concentrate and tighten up the climax.
11290049 11292968 But this is nice, and this does certainly<br />earn you the moment of them
11293052 11294852 being together at the coronation.
11299767 11301643 I think... I think it's really great that<br />Éowyn and Faramir
11301727 11304479 -who are two troubled characters...<br />-Pretty damaged.
11304563 11306023 -...get together. And that's great...<br />-Yeah.
11306107 11306982 -...and that's...<br />-Yeah.
11307066 11308775 You know, we never really<br />were able to celebrate that
11308859 11309985 -in the theatrical version...<br />-Yeah.
11310069 11311404 ...but it's... It has a...
11311737 11312837 Its poignancy is here.
11316450 11318786 -He's kind of more fragile.<br />-Yeah.
11331924 11336303 Not that it's, you know, amazing, but I<br />just like... Love the idea of these Orcs,
11336470 11340266 and Frodo and Sam being caught out.
11340433 11343227 I love it in the book, and...
11343394 11344686 So I enjoyed shooting it,
11344770 11349692 and I was quite sad to actually see it<br />leave the theatrical version.
11349859 11353236 Again, it was just a pacing thing, but I<br />know that there was a lot of people that
11353320 11356782 I think, quite rightly,<br />commented in the reviews and things
11356949 11359368 that... That Frodo and Sam<br />sort of reach Mordor,
11359452 11362371 and appear to go quite unmolested
11362538 11365415 you know, towards the volcano<br />in the theatrical version.
11365499 11369544 So this does certainly make it seem a lot<br />harder for them to actually get there
11369628 11370629 which is great.
11375301 11378637 This was filmed on a real volcano,<br />Ruapehu
11378804 11381704 in the middle of the North Island<br />of New Zealand, and...
11381807 11382891 It was one of those great days.
11382975 11386228 We shot it over, I think, a couple<br />of days, and it was fun. We had...
11386312 11388230 The Orcs are the New Zealand army
11388397 11390608 -in these scenes.<br />-Yeah.
11390774 11392734 They're all soldiers<br />from a nearby army camp
11392818 11394736 because that... This area of New Zealand
11394820 11398532 is a very military...<br />Sort of is a training zone for the army,
11398699 11401243 so we were able to pull in<br />a bunch of soldiers and...
11401327 11402777 And put them in the Orc gear.
11409376 11412421 ...in coming to us was the. "10,000 Orcs<br />now lie between Frodo and Sam."
11412505 11415841 Remember? The emptying of the land,<br />giving it that physical thing
11415925 11419136 about why the Orcs were on the move,<br />tying it in to Frodo and Sam
11419220 11422180 suddenly stumbling across these Orcs<br />who are on their way to the front.
11422264 11424014 -We know exactly why they...<br />-Right.
11426894 11429271 ...to try to draw the Orcs away<br />from Frodo and Sam. And here they are.
11429355 11430439 They're actually in the army
11430523 11431857 -marching towards Aragorn.<br />-I know. I know.
11431941 11435778 Which I kind of... I think is a...<br />Is a neat little twist.
11442368 11444537 This is one of my favorite prosthetics.
11444703 11449083 This guy here, who is...<br />A guy called Phil Grieve, who's played
11449250 11453045 another two or three Orcs for us<br />in other scenes in <i>Two Towers.</i>
11453212 11457466 He... He was... He was an Orc, and he...<br />This makeup just works so well.
11457633 11460844 It's like... Some prosthetic makeup looks<br />a bit silly and cheesy, and...
11460928 11464223 And other makeup just seems to fit.<br />And... And this one is great.
11464390 11468936 I love his white eye<br />and his eaten-away nose.
11469103 11472189 He's had, like, some...<br />Some moths or some insects
11472356 11474316 have had a bit of a nibble at his nose.
11474400 11476443 -Yuck.<br />-It's sort of rotted away.
11476610 11479280 This is potentially very confusing.
11479446 11482157 It was quite hard to sort of<br />edit this to try to make sense
11482241 11484368 because it was quite busy.
11484535 11486620 They... They escape in a different way<br />in the book, don't they?
11486704 11488038 Something to do with a bridge<br />where they...
11488122 11489206 -Don't they end up hanging...<br />-Yeah.
11489290 11491291 -...under a bridge or something?<br />-Under a bridge, yeah.
11491375 11494420 The movie is so vividly etched<br />into your mind
11494587 11496838 I get to the point where<br />I can't remember the differences
11496922 11498423 between the book and the film.
11498507 11500967 Or I can't remember if something<br />was in the book,
11501051 11504179 or if it was an early idea for a...<br />For a scene that we dropped.
11504263 11506765 My memory is just so muddy<br />about all this stuff.
11506849 11508099 -I know.<br />-I haven't obviously picked up
11508183 11509935 the book and actually read<br />the book for years.
11510019 11511853 I read little bits and pieces of it
11511937 11514898 -during pickups.<br />-We were, like, continually reading it...
11514982 11518332 -But not reading it. You're reading it...<br />-But not reading it, yeah.
11519778 11520862 And then you're putting it down,
11520946 11522697 and you're reading a completely<br />different section,
11522781 11525951 and you... You lose the experience<br />of the book as a whole.
11526118 11529955 And I... Now my mind is so muddled up<br />as to what... Which is what.
11530122 11531582 I know.
11531749 11532999 This was a real location.
11533667 11535919 It was called the boulder field,<br />which is...
11536086 11539632 It's like a... A field of large rocks
11539798 11542300 that have been deposited<br />during some volcanic eruption,
11542384 11544428 or a lava flow or a mudflow.
11544595 11546388 And this is...<br />It's just quite amazing to be there.
11546472 11551435 It's this just endless sea of boulders<br />for miles and miles.
11554229 11556857 It was a great...<br />A great place to do Mordor.
11557024 11561487 Obviously the volcano<br />is not quite that shape.
11562738 11566158 This is more establishing<br />the difficulty for Frodo, and...
11569119 11571830 Much more of the effort to cross<br />the plains of Gorgoroth, wasn't it?
11571914 11574083 -Yeah, yeah.<br />-And the climb.
11577461 11582675 Most of it's here, and this... This little<br />scene leads up to them throwing away the armor.
11582841 11585844 I wish we'd made a little bit more of Sam<br />throwing the pots and pans away
11585928 11588054 because it's such a lovely moment<br />in the book.
11588138 11591099 And we have it here, but it's...<br />It's not... I just wished...
11591183 11592767 -It is heartbreaking.<br />-It was one of those things
11592851 11593935 that was just done as a hurry.
11594019 11595520 -I remember when this was shot...<br />-Yeah.
11595604 11599692 ...we were rushing to get scenes finished,<br />and we were behind schedule.
11599858 11602695 And it was...<br />We couldn't sort of dwell on it.
11602861 11606532 But it needed that extra close-up of Sam<br />just saying goodbye
11606699 11611328 to his trusty pots and pans,<br />and we never... We never had that.
11625801 11628428 ...and I only found out<br />when I saw my name on the call sheet.
11628512 11630973 Peter had neglected to tell me.
11631932 11635227 And then I was horrified,<br />because I didn't know what to do.
11635394 11638564 We did shoot this scene twice.<br />We had another run at it,
11638731 11643652 but we shot this out on<br />the Ruapehu stony plain
11643819 11648699 with this big expansive ground at<br />the foot of one of our active volcanoes.
11648866 11650617 It's an extraordinary landscape.
11650784 11654913 It is not that high, I hasten to add.<br />That landscape is a model.
11662254 11666467 It's interesting, because, as far as<br />extras go, it's a very important fact
11666633 11669010 that if you're gonna have people<br />portraying the army
11669094 11671597 then the very best people<br />to use are the army.
11671764 11674683 And they do bring reality to the fact<br />that they're soldiers
11674767 11677478 which you wouldn't get<br />from normal extras.
11677644 11679521 This was shot the day after<br />we did the scene
11679605 11681815 in the beginning of <i>The Two Towers</i><br />where they climb up,
11681899 11683525 and they talk about lembas bread.
11683609 11685652 And they sit down and take<br />the lembas bread out of their pack.
11685736 11687362 Then the next day<br />we're in the same location.
11687446 11689030 It was almost...<br />It was about 10 feet away
11689114 11690990 from where we did that <i>Two Towers</i> scene
11691074 11692617 we did this bit for <i>Return of the King.</i>
11692701 11695036 That was the first time that the guys had<br />ever worn this makeup
11695120 11697622 with all the parched lips<br />and the cracked skin and things,
11697706 11700542 and I really... I really like it.
11700709 11703044 We had to... We had to replace the sky<br />in a lot of these scenes
11703128 11707173 because any... Any time we were shooting<br />Mordor, we had to have clouds in the sky
11707257 11709592 because of the big cloud. And I<br />remember a lot of the Mordor stuff
11709676 11711887 was in blue skies and sun.
11712304 11715933 So we had to have Weta<br />do a major sky replacement,
11716099 11719102 for a lot of the Mordor scenes<br />to get clouds there.
11719269 11723774 Which is sometimes not that easy, to pull<br />a matte off the edge of people's hair,
11723941 11726985 and replace the sky above them.<br />And especially if...
11727152 11728820 Because sometimes the sky<br />tends to burn out,
11728904 11732991 and you lose your edges around the<br />hairline, and it's a... Gets a bit tricky.
11736662 11740999 This was inspired by a scene in the book<br />of Frodo swatting invisible flies
11741166 11743918 walking along,<br />which I always remember that passage,
11744002 11746171 and wanted to portray it in the movie.
11746338 11750676 This particular scene is Sean Astin's last<br />scene that we ever shot of him as Sam.
11750843 11753720 It was his last day on<br /><i>Return of the King</i> pickups.
11753887 11757683 Finished the scene, and then we had<br />a party for him straight afterwards.
11759977 11761770 We did develop the Eyeball in this film.
11761854 11764397 It looks sort of the same.<br />But we actually had it moving around
11764481 11766691 which I don't think we did<br />in the earlier films, did we?
11766775 11768943 We... We realized in this one<br />that we had to have the Eye
11769027 11772155 actually physically searching<br />for Frodo and Sam.
11774116 11775466 -Yeah, it is. It is.<br />-It is.
11778537 11780163 And it's more powerful.
11782791 11784209 Yeah.
11787421 11791508 It's the only bit of wide, flat desert<br />land in New Zealand that we could find.
11791675 11796221 And it was in the... It was near Ruapehu<br />on the army munitions training ground.
11796388 11800851 And this particular landscape had about<br />40 years of bombs dropped on it.
11801018 11803729 Hand grenades, mortars.<br />Bombs from aircraft.
11803896 11806314 And this was a sort of a no-go area.<br />It was an area that...
11806398 11809692 That nobody ever goes, because there's<br />so much unexploded ammo there.
11809776 11811736 And we said to the army,<br />"Listen, you've gotta help us.
11811820 11814823 This is the only place we can film.<br />We need a flat desert landscape,
11814907 11817659 and this is the only place in New<br />Zealand we can find this landscape."
11817743 11820995 The army guys sort of rolled their heads,<br />looking like, "Oh, my God."
11821079 11823540 And I think if it was up to some<br />of those junior officers
11823624 11824999 they would've told us just<br />to get stuffed.
11825083 11826668 But fortunately the government<br />said to them:
11826752 11828461 "Listen, you've gotta help<br />the <i>Lord of the Rings</i> people."
11828545 11831840 So the army had to go through<br />a bomb-disposal exercise.
11832007 11835594 They had to have their bomb-disposal<br />people clear decades' worth
11835761 11839348 of unexploded munitions.<br />They had to clear it from this huge area.
11839514 11841766 And on the day that we arrived<br />to do the shooting here
11841850 11845812 we had a big lecture from the army officer<br />who basically had it laid out on a table
11845896 11848398 about 10 different types of bombs<br />and hand grenades.
11848482 11850733 And said,<br />"Listen, this is what you might find.
11850817 11854445 If you see any one of these objects lying<br />on the ground, you are to stay still
11854529 11857907 put up your hand, and a bomb-disposal<br />person will come over straightaway."
11857991 11861077 And so we had bomb-disposal people<br />surrounding us while we were shooting
11861161 11864247 ready to jump in if...<br />If any one of us kicked something
11864414 11866916 with our toe and looked down<br />and found it was a bomb on the ground.
11867000 11869050 -Quite a tense time.<br />-But didn't they say:
11878261 11881390 So the Mouth of Sauron<br />is played by Bruce Spence.
11881556 11884267 Well, you'd certainly remember him<br />if you had seen <i>Mad Max 2</i>
11884351 11886019 which is <i>The Road Warrior,</i><br />I think it's called.
11886103 11889690 And he plays the autogiro,<br />the little helicopter pilot.
11889856 11892150 And he's, along with Christopher Lee...<br />He's...
11892234 11893860 And Brad Dourif, he's the other actor
11893944 11897405 that actually was cut out completely<br />out of... Out of <i>Return of the King.</i>
11897489 11899539 So it was great to have him<br />back in again.
11899658 11902410 And he's described as the Mouth of Sauron,<br />and so I wanted Weta to...
11902494 11904997 To design a helmet<br />that just featured his mouth.
11906832 11909417 And so they did something that<br />deliberately sort of...
11909501 11911044 It just didn't feature eyes.
11911211 11913630 It was just... And the design of it was...
11913797 11918010 Everything was emphasizing the...<br />The... Where the mouth was.
11918176 11920326 And we shot Bruce and...<br />And did the stuff,
11920470 11923070 and he had a little prosthetic<br />on around his lips.
11923223 11924307 And then when we were in post
11924391 11926476 I just felt that the Mouth of Sauron<br />wasn't distinctive enough,
11926560 11928436 and it wasn't sort of memorable enough.
11928520 11931314 And so what we ended up doing,<br />which I think worked really well,
11931398 11932774 and I... I'm really quite pleased with it
11932858 11937195 is we took Bruce Spence's original<br />prosthetic mouth,
11937362 11940615 and we simply cut it out,<br />and we enlarged it,
11940782 11942283 and we pasted it back on again.
11942367 11947622 So that the mouth that you're seeing here<br />is exactly what we shot at the time
11947789 11950625 except about 50 percent bigger<br />than his real mouth.
11950792 11952627 And it's a disturbing effect
11952794 11954420 because you don't quite know<br />what's wrong with it.
11954504 11958383 But it looks weird.<br />It looks sort of unnatural.
11966016 11968852 Another Aragorn beheading.<br />It was great to...
11969019 11972230 Heads getting chopped off tends<br />to pop up in these extended cuts.
11973231 11975581 Something I'm quite grateful for,<br />I have to say.
11977861 11981211 One of the main problems was that<br />all the characters are engaging
11982074 11984574 in the possible death of Frodo<br />at a time that
11984701 11987301 because the film is back<br />in chronological order
11987454 11989247 we know that Frodo's alive and well.
11989331 11994002 And so suddenly your characters are<br />playing things that we are not buying into.
11994377 11997923 Because in the... In the book,<br />it's played in a way that you
11998090 11999757 the reader of the book,<br />could possibly think
11999841 12001009 that Frodo is dead at this stage.
12001093 12004221 You actually are believing<br />what the Mouth of Sauron's saying.
12004387 12007098 When we restructured the film<br />to be more chronological
12007182 12010982 it just didn't work anymore in that<br />way. We couldn't make it work anymore.
12014606 12017776 This was a very small studio set<br />surrounded by green screen.
12017943 12020278 The rocks were made<br />of a spongy sort of stuff.
12020445 12022155 They look like very sharp, jagged rocks.
12022239 12026368 It would've been dangerous to have<br />the actors falling on them and tumbling.
12026535 12031623 So we made the rocks out of a sponge,<br />and they were actually like soft rubber.
12033458 12035544 Galloping back over the minefield again.
12035710 12038880 It added a certain degree of tension<br />to the days we were shooting here.
12038964 12041674 And the army guys were looking<br />at how far away they were galloping,
12041758 12042842 and I think they were thinking:
12042926 12045136 "God, they're... They're going into a bit<br />that we haven't cleared."
12045220 12047221 Because they were going<br />a long way away, and I was...
12047305 12050183 I was getting a bit nervous about it.
12051560 12054771 Viggo did this speech really well.<br />He did it just as you see it.
12054938 12056648 He did about six or seven takes.
12056815 12059442 He was shouting so much,<br />his voice was getting hoarser,
12059526 12062654 and hoarser as the...<br />The takes were... Were going through.
12065115 12067765 -Is that a word, "hoarser"?<br />-Well, it is... It is now.
12069452 12072580 And that's... Again, that's the<br />New Zealand army that he's addressing.
12072664 12074665 And it was good. It was a real<br />sort of military moment
12074749 12076751 because Viggo<br />was throwing himself into it,
12076835 12079337 and the soldiers were responding<br />really well and appropriately.
12079421 12081714 It's the sort of thing that<br />I guess soldiers expect to hear
12081798 12084898 from some general, don't they?<br />When they're... When they're...
12090348 12091182 -Well, you don't know.<br />-No, we don't know.
12091266 12092934 -Hey, Gallipoli.<br />-Gallipoli.
12110493 12113121 ...but it was so dangerous<br />that Sean and Elijah...
12113288 12116791 ...actually had safety wires on them when<br />they were climbing up that... That bank.
12116875 12119502 It was a lot steeper<br />than it ended up looking on film,
12119586 12120962 and we had to paint the wires out
12121046 12123548 because you can see them<br />trailing on behind them.
12123632 12126468 And it was on the side of a real volcano.
12129221 12130930 This is, I think... This is...<br />This is my favorite bit
12131014 12132974 -of Howard Shore music.<br />-Yeah.
12133141 12135191 -It's beautiful.<br />-The flute that he plays.
12135352 12138729 I think this is probably, if I had<br />to name my favorite track of music...
12138813 12141763 -Is it the whistle?<br />-Yeah, the whistle, rather. The whistle.
12141858 12144402 -It's beautiful.<br />-Oh, he's a genius.
12144569 12146571 And I remember shooting this stuff.<br />Remember this day?
12146655 12148656 -It was on the side of the volcano.<br />-Yeah.
12148740 12151493 And we had big lights,<br />and these are all real rocks,
12151660 12152994 and this stuff isn't rubber.
12153078 12157249 They were clamoring up, and it was...<br />It was quite a steep slope.
12157415 12162212 And yeah, it was kind of<br />dramatic stuff to film.
12168426 12169969 -I did. I gave it up for a year.<br />-We had to stop writing
12170053 12171846 -to go to the...<br />-I had to get the patches.
12171930 12173830 The pharmacy, to get you some patches.
12175016 12177811 Oh, God. That means you are.
12178103 12181648 This stuff was an amalgam of original<br />footage and some pickups we did.
12181815 12184692 We shot, like, this little exchange<br />between Legolas and Gimli
12184776 12186319 during pickups separately
12186403 12188070 because they weren't in the country<br />at the same time.
12188154 12190823 We shot Orlando first<br />and then John Rhys-Davies later
12190907 12195107 because we wanted to introduce a little<br />bit more character stuff into this climax.
12197163 12200013 And also wrapping up their little story<br />that was in there.
12200166 12201459 That was really sweet.
12205755 12207132 This was shot in a hurry.
12207299 12211261 It was done on the edge of a volcano,<br />and it was done at the late afternoon.
12211428 12214055 It was the... It was the same day that<br />we'd shot all the crawling-up stuff.
12214139 12216724 And it was one of those situations<br />where I hadn't planned the day too well
12216808 12220186 because I had spent, like, three-quarters<br />of the day shooting them crawling
12220270 12221729 shot after shot of them crawling.
12221813 12225358 And then this long dialogue scene got<br />squashed into the last two or three hours.
12225442 12228945 It's... Sometimes you set out on the day.<br />And you don't quite judge it properly,
12229029 12231405 and you end up realizing,<br />when it's too late
12231489 12235243 that you've emphasized... You've spent<br />most of your time on the wrong thing.
12235327 12238579 And I realized, "Oh, God. I've got this<br />incredibly important dialogue scene"
12238663 12240581 "to shoot." And...<br />And we were literally losing the light.
12240665 12241916 The sun was going down fast.
12242000 12245253 It was about 4:00 in the afternoon<br />when we started.
12245420 12250342 And so, what we did is we just<br />did it in... In basically in two shots
12250508 12252093 because that's all we had time for.
12252177 12255179 We did... We started by shooting<br />the close-ups of Sean and Elijah,
12255263 12257682 and we shot them together.<br />So we had one camera
12257766 12261519 our A camera on Elijah and our B camera<br />on Sean, which you don't normally do.
12261603 12264063 Normally, you shoot one actor,<br />and then you turn the cameras around,
12264147 12266774 and you shoot the other actor separately,<br />but I didn't have time for that.
12266858 12269308 So I actually did what they call<br />cross coverage
12269444 12272154 where you're shooting...<br />You're shooting them both simultaneously.
12272238 12275288 And we did... We did three takes,<br />is all that we had time for.
12275408 12278869 And we literally couldn't do a fourth take.<br />Because we were losing the light so fast.
12278953 12281247 And we had time to do one wide shot,<br />which I also needed,
12281331 12283374 and I did that<br />with an A and B camera as well.
12283458 12287462 So when it cuts to the wide shot<br />of them picking him up and stuff
12287629 12289729 that's... That's the other, wider camera.
12289881 12295303 And it's just... It was done as a rush,<br />but they threw themselves into it.
12295470 12298681 And Sean was amazing. Elijah was great.
12298848 12303269 And what you see here is what we got<br />in a hurry at the end of the day.
12313905 12316155 We were back here,<br />and we'd seen the rushes,
12316282 12318243 and we sent the boys a fax.
12318410 12320995 And we made it look really formal,<br />like it was a memo.
12321079 12324624 On the next page we...<br />We put, "You made us cry."
12332632 12336678 It was based around the idea<br />that Sauron is coming out to face Aragorn.
12336845 12339847 And what you're seeing here of Aragorn<br />walking towards the Eye
12339931 12342224 Viggo was actually walking<br />towards Sauron on the day
12342308 12344352 that we shot it four years ago<br />on the desert.
12344436 12346187 He's moving towards Annatar.
12346354 12348440 Well, yeah. Well, don't get...
12348606 12351693 It was a vision. A vision<br />which turns out to be Sauron.
12355613 12357406 And we thought,<br />"Well, he's just an eyeball,
12357490 12360285 so it's gonna have to be<br />a kind of projected vision."
12360452 12362078 And we also thought<br />it would be interesting
12362162 12366416 because you didn't want the big<br />14-foot warrior to come out immediately
12366583 12371296 that... That you're waiting to see the most<br />hideous being on the earth, the most...
12371463 12374757 An embodiment of evil.<br />And in fact he's beautiful.
12374924 12378219 So we had this conceit for a long time<br />that we just threw out there
12378303 12380012 that actually Sauron would appear,
12380096 12382932 and he would be the most beautiful man<br />you've ever seen
12383016 12386978 which is, of course, Annatar, the<br />way it... In which he fought the Elves.
12387145 12389772 -Sauron the Fair.<br />-Yeah, Sauron the Fair. Yeah.
12393151 12394860 ...and we were back to the beginning<br />of the first one...
12394944 12396529 ...not coming up with anything new<br />or different.
12396613 12398239 -It was the same imagery...<br />-Yeah.
12398323 12400492 ...that when Sauron's bashing...
12400658 12403870 -...the hell out of Isildur at the beginning.<br />-Yeah.
12406706 12408499 -...which have your showdown between...<br />-Yeah, yeah.
12408583 12410460 ...your big hero and your villain.
12417509 12420637 We'd shot a version<br />of this scene similar.
12420803 12424349 Similar, but not as good<br />in our original shoot.
12424516 12427017 And it was this... It was the...<br />I think it was about the first time
12427101 12428894 we ever filmed anything with Gollum,
12428978 12431397 and we didn't really know<br />what we were doing,
12431481 12433131 and how it was all gonna work.
12433274 12436068 And I realized when I looked at the<br />footage that we did the first time around
12436152 12439322 that the fight was just not<br />gonna be very good
12439489 12441616 because we hadn't shot it properly.
12441783 12446037 We hadn't quite done it in the way<br />that we subsequently
12446204 12448804 got much more experience<br />at doing Gollum's scenes.
12450458 12451876 -"Sméagol lied"?<br />-No.
12456548 12459049 I mean, we did write some new dialogue<br />for it and changed it a bit,
12459133 12461093 but it was basically redoing something
12461177 12465306 that we had a crack at<br />about three years earlier.
12468059 12471145 "Sméagol promised, Sméagol lied,"<br />to show that actually everyone
12471229 12475233 who'd been sucked in by how nice<br />Sméagol was had misunderstood
12475400 12477277 the true nature of his character.
12482323 12484023 This was great cutting here, Pete.
12488413 12490414 Well, it's gonna make the difference<br />with these sorts of scenes
12490498 12494794 that you have any number of ways<br />you can go. We just shot lots of fighting.
12494961 12496170 You always shoot too much,
12496254 12498797 and then you just pick out<br />the very best little bits and pieces.
12498881 12501050 And there's so many ways<br />you could cut it together
12501134 12504429 and... And you have to figure out<br />how long are you gonna stay
12504596 12506296 with the Black Gate's battle
12507307 12509016 before you go to back to Frodo and Sam
12509100 12510684 and... And where are Frodo<br />and Sam gonna be?
12510768 12515565 And it's just a range of possibilities.
12522238 12526534 ...we should bring the moth in to at least tie<br />it back in to the old <i>Fellowship</i> imagery...
12526618 12528744 ...that we had.<br />Because it is in the book, of course...
12528828 12530997 ...that the eagles arrive at the end.
12531164 12535877 It does make you wonder why they didn't<br />summon an eagle at Rivendell,
12536044 12538796 and just have the eagle fly to Mordor.
12538963 12540131 Because the Nazgûl
12540465 12541674 would have taken them out.
12541758 12543384 Yes, I know. We've already discussed that,<br />haven't we?
12543468 12545511 Everybody always says that, but...
12546596 12549682 When we were editing<br /><i>The Return of the King</i> last year
12549849 12551475 I remember at one stage thinking:
12551559 12555021 "You know, what if...? If I keep going<br />in chronological order
12555188 12558107 I'm gonna run out of time,<br />and the last, you know
12558274 12560860 half an hour of the film<br />is gonna get rushed."
12561027 12563571 And I knew that the editing of this<br />was gonna be something
12563655 12568618 that was... Had to be felt right. So I<br />jumped out of cutting earlier material,
12568785 12570995 and I just started to edit.
12571162 12573956 And I said, "If I... If I'm gonna spend<br />any time on something
12574040 12577918 in this film in the editing room, it's<br />gotta be these last climactic sequences.
12578002 12581130 And... And if I'm rushing things at<br />the end, I'd rather rush other stuff."
12581214 12586135 So I... I jumped onto this, and I spent<br />a lot of time with Jamie Selkirk
12587220 12591224 editing this sequence<br />and really trying to make it work.
12591391 12594727 And we tried two or three different things,<br />and then eventually it just sort of clicked.
12594811 12597855 We just... We just got it,<br />and it worked and...
12598022 12600372 -It's really good.<br />-And it never really changed.
12603194 12605144 I can't remember now. I can't remember.
12606406 12607656 -All the rest of it.<br />-All the rest of it.
12607740 12609617 Everything else.
12616040 12618584 It was just a bit of stone wall, really
12618751 12621086 was just about all it was,<br />with a little piece of rock.
12621170 12625091 And most of the wide shots are a<br />miniature, and we just put so much smoke,
12625258 12627843 and colored light in there<br />that we... We got away with it.
12627927 12631889 It was actually... I'm... I'm quite<br />pleased with the way that it ended up
12632056 12633725 considering how simple it was.
12636060 12639063 -Who designed the Crack of Doom?<br />-I... I actually feel it was mainly John Howe.
12639147 12643097 At the beginning I... I think that was one<br />of the things that we got John to do.
12647655 12650408 But at the time it probably wasn't<br />such a dodgy name.
12650575 12652242 -Why is it dodgy?<br />-Well, it just sounds like
12652326 12656246 something out of Dungeons & Dragons or,
12656330 12659542 you know, sort of B-grade fantasy.
12659709 12662309 -Don't you think, "Crack of Doom"?<br />-The sex industry.
12663087 12666591 -Oh, God.<br />-Hey, shush, shush, shush.
12673681 12676975 ...because... Because in one way or<br />another everything's leading up to it...
12677059 12679311 ...and... And you just don't want it<br />to be disappointing.
12679395 12682899 And it's tricky for the actors.<br />It's tricky for... For everybody.
12683065 12687403 Sean and Elijah are always just...<br />Just committed to it so, so deeply.
12687570 12689405 I... That's an image<br />I always wanted to see
12689489 12692533 which was Gollum on top<br />of the invisible Frodo's shoulders.
12692617 12695369 I thought that would look really cool.
12696788 12699688 Now, the... The interesting thing<br />with this troll is that
12699791 12702210 this is using the Sauron fight footage.
12702376 12705076 We painted Sauron out, and...<br />And we put the troll in
12705213 12708340 because we never shot anything<br />of Aragorn fighting the troll.
12708424 12710926 We shot a little bit of him at the end,<br />actually, lying on the ground,
12711010 12714096 but we decided that the best fight<br />footage we could use was actually
12714180 12718059 the original footage of him<br />fighting Sauron.
12719644 12721145 I didn't wanna wimp out
12721312 12724440 at showing the whole thing<br />of Frodo's finger getting bitten off.
12724524 12727776 I wanted that to be fairly graphic, just<br />to be what it was, with lots of blood
12727860 12730112 because I just... I thought at<br />this stage in the movie you...
12730196 12734659 You... You just can't afford to...<br />To not go there, you know.
12741749 12744168 ...a film camera through, obviously.
12744335 12747964 Unless you have one of those cameras<br />that they stick up your bottom.
12748130 12749423 But we won't talk about that.
12749507 12753553 But, in a computer,<br />you can actually just pass through
12753719 12756055 a tiny object like a Ring and...
12756222 12757272 -Sorry.<br />-Laparoscopic!
12757390 12761477 Laparoscopic... A laparoscopic camera<br />passing through the Ring.
12761644 12763855 -Yes, indeed.<br />-Don't even...
12766065 12768067 -I think he is.<br />-I know.
12773072 12776116 ...on his two feet rather than all fours<br />for this moment at the end.
12776200 12777701 In fact, there was a couple<br />of times earlier
12777785 12780788 when I talked about Gollum lurching<br />to his feet, and he just refused.
12780872 12782581 Andy said, "No, we've gotta do that<br />in the Crack of Doom.
12782665 12784124 We've gotta save that.<br />We've gotta save that."
12784208 12785292 I think he was probably thinking:
12785376 12788045 "How can I show the Ring empowering<br />my character?"
12788212 12790589 He really wanted to make something<br />of the fact that the Ring,
12790673 12793551 and standing up like a normal<br />human being was a way
12793718 12796968 that Andy felt he... He could actually<br />show the Ring doing that.
12802727 12805312 ...and then accidentally<br />falling into the... The lava...
12805396 12806814 ...which is basically what<br />happens in the book.
12806898 12810984 I just, personally... I know why Tolkien<br />did it, and I know all the arguments for it,
12811068 12812945 but I just never wanted to do that.
12813029 12815614 I felt so strongly that Frodo<br />had to be some part of it.
12815698 12816699 Yes.
12816866 12818242 -We shot it three ways.<br />-We did.
12818326 12820744 We shot... The first time,<br />we shot Frodo murdering him
12820828 12822478 basically just shoving him in.
12822580 12825165 Then we shot the book,<br />which was Gollum dancing around,
12825249 12827292 -and tripping and falling in himself.<br />-Which didn't work either.
12827376 12829253 And then... Then we did this version
12829337 12831380 which was actually done right...<br />Right at the very end, wasn't it?
12831464 12835134 It was done on...<br />On just about Elijah's last day, I think.
12837094 12838929 This is the shot that was the last shot
12839013 12842013 that Weta delivered<br />for the theatrical <i>Return of the King.</i>
12842141 12845770 This is... This was being worked on<br />right up until it was too late
12845937 12847437 because it was a tough shot to do.
12847521 12850441 How do you show this bloody Ring<br />finally being destroyed?
12850608 12853108 Originally this wasn't gonna be<br />the way it was cut.
12855404 12857281 ...then we were gonna show all of this...<br />The saving sequence.
12857365 12858991 We're gonna have the two separated,
12859075 12861775 but we ended up editing it.<br />Like, crosscutting it
12861911 12865706 between the two events to make it seem<br />like it was all happening at the same time.
12865790 12867840 Yeah, that was a late thought, wasn't it?
12872171 12876271 It felt like the climax of the film was<br />dissipated over too great a period of time.
12876425 12878344 And that was when we all talked about:
12878970 12880220 "Well, you know, what if...?
12880304 12881680 What if we collapsed it all<br />into one moment?"
12881764 12883307 Yes.
12888980 12891816 And you actually dread it<br />because you're just worried
12891983 12893692 that it's not gonna live up<br />to expectations.
12893776 12896821 And it was basically<br />the destruction of Mordor.
12896988 12898614 What happens when the Ring<br />gets destroyed?
12898698 12899907 I mean, that... That's a big question.
12899991 12904370 And it's not... You know, it's not described<br />in great detail by Tolkien in the book,
12904537 12905829 but what happens to all the Orcs?
12905913 12908790 I mean, do they all drop down dead<br />when the Ring's destroyed, or...?
12908874 12909833 I mean, what happens?
12909917 12912817 -What happens to...? To Sauron?<br />-No, they do talk about it.
12915339 12916757 It's one of those things that's scary.
12916841 12919051 It's especially frightening<br />to have to visualize it
12919135 12921428 because you're worried that<br />you're not gonna do it justice, and...
12921512 12925516 We decided early on that<br />the destruction of the Black Tower
12925683 12929645 was gonna be a digital model,<br />not a model that we would blast apart
12929812 12933190 with pyrotechnics, like often you see<br />miniatures being destroyed
12933274 12935943 with little explosions.<br />And film them with slow motion.
12936027 12939030 And so we had one of our CG artists,<br />Gray Horsefield
12939196 12943159 spend literally months and months<br />building and designing
12943325 12945869 the destruction of Barad-dûr.<br />And he ultimately delivered the goods.
12945953 12949206 He did a great job, but it was a<br />very complicated job for him
12949373 12952459 to do it in the computer, and then...<br />I wanted some really biblical size.
12952543 12956964 I always regarded this as being...<br />This is... This has gotta be biblical,
12957131 12961052 and it's... Not just in size and scale<br />but also in the way you...
12961218 12963512 You portray the events.
12963679 12965639 It... It's like the parting<br />of the Red Sea, isn't it?
12965723 12972063 It's like... It's just some apocalyptic<br />vision, and I wanted it to have that scale
12972229 12974898 because I think the film deserves it<br />or the three movies deserve it.
12974982 12979152 You... You get to this point, you've earned...<br />You've earned your sort of a... You...
12979236 12982907 You've earned the moment where you<br />can get to see this finally happen
12983074 12985909 because you've been trying to get<br />to this place and this moment in time,
12985993 12988204 for, like, you know, 10 or 11 hours.
12989538 12991415 -It's deliverance.<br />-Well, it is.
13002843 13004970 We actually realized one<br />of those things...
13005304 13007806 We thought that we'd shot the end<br />of <i>The Return of the King</i>
13007890 13010517 you know, three or four years ago<br />in our original shoot.
13010601 13012144 But when we came to edit
13012353 13013353 this film together
13013437 13015564 we actually realized that one<br />of the things we hadn't really shot
13015648 13018692 was the reaction of everybody else<br />to the destruction of the Ring.
13018776 13022195 We literally just hadn't done it, because<br />we had... I hadn't thought about it, really.
13022279 13024779 I think I'd shot Gandalf reacting,<br />but nobody else.
13024907 13028828 And so when each of our actors<br />came out for pickups last year
13028994 13032539 they each had their turn, because they<br />were in the country at different times.
13032623 13035459 They weren't all together.<br />So they each had their turn at reacting
13035543 13038462 to the... To the...<br />The destruction of Mordor.
13038629 13040964 And I'd put them in the costume<br />and have a few extras behind them,
13041048 13042174 and explain what was going on.
13042258 13046095 And so, you know, Viggo did it,<br />Ian did it again
13046262 13048806 Orlando did it, Billy did it, Dom did it.
13048973 13050516 They each had to do their bit.
13050683 13054061 And I wanted their reactions to be,<br />obviously, appropriate to their character,
13054145 13055896 and to be different from each other.
13055980 13058648 So we just went through a variety<br />of different performances.
13058732 13061443 And it's a hard thing to react to, because<br />you're literally just staring at
13061527 13063177 a piece of tape on the wall,
13063320 13067992 and yet you've got to portray<br />this cataclysmic, emotional event.
13068159 13070535 And I thought all of...<br />All of them did really well, you know.
13070619 13074373 There wasn't a... There wasn't<br />a bum note in the house, as they say.
13077668 13079368 The lava's all computer generated.
13079503 13081505 I think it's a combination, actually,<br />of computer generated,
13081589 13086510 and sort of a... A milk and syrup<br />mixture that they blasted in the air.
13096353 13098563 This scene wasn't so difficult<br />to shoot, really.
13098647 13100816 These scenes are sometimes a bit easier
13100983 13102651 because I had a fairly clear idea<br />in my mind
13102735 13105885 about what I wanted this scene<br />to feel like and to look like.
13106447 13109147 Some scenes you...<br />You know the moment you write them,
13109241 13111451 or the moment you think about them.<br />You know what you want them to be.
13111535 13113287 And they're ultimately easy.
13113454 13116414 So for, you know, a couple of years later,<br />you find yourself on the set, shooting,
13116498 13117708 and it's not so bad.
13117875 13119876 Other scenes like the destruction scenes,
13119960 13124173 or Frodo and... With the Ring<br />in the Crack of Doom
13124340 13125841 you dread some of these scenes
13125925 13128093 because you type them into the script
13128886 13130971 you talk about them,<br />but you really don't quite know
13131055 13133515 what they have to be<br />or what they should be like.
13133599 13136477 And you kind of dread the day<br />when you have to shoot them.
13136644 13139104 And you just hope that<br />when you arrive on that day
13139188 13140522 you've actually got a good idea.
13140606 13142482 And sometimes you do,<br />and sometimes you don't.
13142566 13144526 And usually, the...<br />The great thing I've discovered, though
13144610 13147737 is that if I don't have good ideas<br />on the day, often the actors do.
13147821 13151491 And sometimes you show up on set, and<br />you're just relying on the actors, you know.
13151575 13153326 And if I don't have a good idea.<br />I might just say:
13153410 13156371 "Okay, boys, well, let's just block<br />the scene and run it through and...
13156455 13157956 "And show me what you think," you know.
13158040 13162086 And I sort of let...<br />Let them come up with something.
13164421 13167174 This was another moment<br />which I always imagined too
13167341 13169176 which was just this fade to black.
13169260 13171678 Because I wanted a real feeling<br />that it might have been the end,
13171762 13174098 and I wanted this long black patch.
13174265 13177851 And then I just wanted this image.<br />This was an image that was based,
13178018 13180896 or inspired, by a painting<br />that John Howe did.
13181063 13183440 It was this moment. This exact moment.
13183607 13185985 -And I remember seeing the painting.<br />-Yeah.
13186151 13188236 It was... It was while we were<br />in pre-production on the film
13188320 13189821 we hadn't shot anything yet and...
13189905 13196120 And that painting just gave me a sense<br />of exactly what this moment should be.
13204295 13206713 And then I wanted this to...<br />I never had a problem with this.
13206797 13211093 This is one of those sequences<br />that I had ingrained in my mind
13211260 13215556 about two or three years<br />before we ever shot it.
13216598 13218600 I sort of had this feeling<br />of what I wanted to do
13218684 13222229 with this fade to white and then<br />the dissolve through to Frodo in the bed.
13222313 13223813 -You know...<br />-It never changed.
13229278 13232128 I mean, you got to imagine,<br />you know, what...? What do...?
13232281 13235200 If you're... If you're one of<br />our actors playing
13235367 13237410 Frodo's friends, you know,<br />the other members of the Fellowship
13237494 13239496 I mean, what do you do?
13239663 13242374 What does your character do<br />when they see Frodo alive?
13242541 13245794 And I know... I remember<br />that discussion with Ian.
13245961 13248672 And I said to him,<br />"Well, what...? What would Gandalf do?"
13248756 13252217 And Ian thought, and he said,<br />"I think Gandalf would laugh."
13252843 13255304 And so I said, "Okay, that sounds good.
13255471 13256930 Let's laugh then."
13257097 13258974 -And that's what he did.<br />-It's the... It's...
13259058 13260908 -And it's back where they were.<br />-Yeah.
13264480 13266180 -Talks about him laughing...<br />-Yeah.
13266273 13267274 ...and his joy.
13270069 13272320 ...everyone having to react<br />to the destruction of the Ring...
13272404 13273655 ...that we just talked about, you know.
13273739 13276283 Now they're having to react to Frodo,<br />seeing Frodo again.
13276367 13277868 And... And so it's...
13278035 13279995 It's important moments...<br />Moment for the characters.
13280079 13282873 It's so important to get them<br />all together again.
13290047 13293634 It's really interesting. There was<br />such a strong reaction amongst
13293801 13295302 -people who had seen the film. And...<br />-Yeah.
13295386 13297846 And there was...<br />And there was some people that,
13298013 13301141 -for this, they sobbed at this moment.<br />-Yeah, yeah.
13301308 13304228 And then other people<br />absolutely hated it.
13304395 13306397 Of course, I think it's fantastic.
13309566 13311067 I mean, I know if I was<br />watching the movie
13311151 13312986 I'd... I'd want to see<br />this sort of scene, though.
13313070 13315770 I mean, this is...<br />It's exactly what I would wanna see.
13318200 13321100 ...where at that moment,<br />all you can hear is the sniffling.
13321245 13323956 And it's like, "It's working."
13338804 13341473 I'm really very happy with this.
13350107 13353026 We'd written a whole conversation,<br />and I remember on the day
13353110 13356210 people turned up with those pages,<br />and you threw it all out.
13365914 13369209 This was another image that I had from<br />the beginning, of this climb up the prow.
13369293 13372087 Actually, I always imagined it<br />with confetti streaming down.
13372171 13376633 I always thought of that being,<br />like, a rain of confetti
13376800 13379970 sweeping past the camera<br />as you rise up past the...
13380137 13382305 Past the prow. I think that's what...<br />What was in our storyboards.
13382389 13384391 But we never... We never did that<br />in the movie at the end of the day.
13384475 13387644 Or petals, those little rose petals,<br />it was gonna be, not confetti.
13387728 13392232 This was a combination of original stuff<br />that we shot, with the crowd stuff
13392399 13394799 was... And the wide shots<br />were originally shot.
13394902 13400365 But we did pickups of the close-ups<br />of Gandalf and Aragorn basically
13400532 13403619 where... Where they were re-shot.
13418509 13420409 ...that was his last shot on the film.
13422846 13424764 Yeah, that was... Yeah, that was his last.<br />It's interesting
13424848 13427898 you remember all those last shots,<br />don't you? You remember?
13429603 13432753 -...I remember thinking I was gonna get...<br />-Being told about it.
13433148 13434983 No, I was on the makeup stage with Andy
13435067 13436151 -and... And we wrapped late.<br />-Yeah.
13436235 13437610 -Oh, that's right.<br />-And you wrapped before us.
13437694 13438945 -That's right.<br />-I tried to get down there.
13439029 13440906 -Yeah, you did.<br />-That's right.
13444326 13447287 Because it was done at the time he<br />was doing everything else in the film
13447371 13449414 he obviously didn't have a beard.<br />So it was fake.
13449498 13452542 But when he came out to New Zealand<br />to do pickups, we... We said to him:
13452626 13454126 "Listen, can you grow a beard?
13454378 13457046 And we'll reshoot all the close-ups<br />of you with a real beard"
13457130 13458339 because the beard looked kind of fake.
13458423 13461134 And that was one of the reasons that we<br />wanted to reshoot the close-ups, actually.
13461218 13464220 And so he grew this beard,<br />and it was the first thing that we shot.
13464304 13467754 And then we had him shave it off<br />and do the rest of his Aragorn stuff.
13473438 13477838 It was Viggo's idea to sing the song, which<br />is in the book, isn't it? That Aragorn sings?
13479903 13482322 -Oh, okay. Oh, okay. He said he...<br />-He doesn't sing... No.
13482406 13483407 -No.<br />-No.
13483574 13484575 Oh.
13484741 13486591 But, I mean, it's great. It's very...
13489121 13491748 It's one of those things<br />that could work or might not work.
13491832 13493166 -Yeah.<br />-And...
13493333 13495752 But, you know, I...<br />I just think it's unexpected.
13495919 13499172 I mean, to have him turn around<br />and then to start singing
13499339 13501508 is... is unusual. It's...<br />It's unexpected.
13501592 13502967 It... It feels like Tolkien.
13503051 13504511 And so therefore I think<br />it's a good thing to do.
13504595 13505596 It is Tolkien.
13505762 13509099 I think just the mere fact that<br />it's a surprise alone
13509266 13511184 -makes it sort of interesting, and then it...<br />-Yeah.
13511268 13513770 I just think it's nice for his character.
13515355 13517107 This is a lovely moment for Liv.
13517274 13520068 Another one of those major events,<br />something we've been waiting for,
13520152 13522529 for three movies,<br />to get these two finally together.
13522613 13525823 And just figuring out how to shoot<br />this stuff is kind of tricky because...
13525907 13528368 Often, shooting it<br />just in a simple, elegant way
13528452 13530996 is better than making it overly complex.
13531163 13533540 When we redid this.<br />Some of this stuff in pickups
13533624 13537168 it was primarily for the beard, really,<br />because the fake beard did look fake.
13537252 13539902 And we changed the staging of it<br />a wee bit, didn't we?
13541548 13544259 -You wanted Elrond to be there with Arwen.<br />-That's right...
13544343 13546010 She was in a separate...<br />In separate shots
13546094 13548430 with an incredibly unusual hairstyle.
13551016 13554645 -Yeah.<br />-Elrond's hairstyle was very, very unusual.
13562235 13564780 And then I wanted them<br />to have a real good kiss
13564946 13567657 which we didn't have in<br />the original shooting either, did we?
13567741 13568992 I wanted them to just...
13569326 13573371 I just felt like they... They... They needed<br />to just... Because it was one of those...
13573455 13576583 It's a bit like what we were saying<br />with Gandalf, is "What do you do"
13576667 13578793 when you see Frodo's alive?"<br />Well, you laugh.
13578877 13581170 And what would these two do<br />when they come together, and you think:
13581254 13582547 "Well, of course, what would they do?
13582631 13586050 "They'd... They'd grab each other and...<br />And have a hell of a great kiss," you know.
13586134 13588553 We just felt that's<br />the most obvious thing to do and...
13588637 13590763 And it also just breaks that formality,<br />you know
13590847 13593547 all the... The pompous ceremony<br />that's been going on.
13593684 13596812 -Just... Just get them together.<br />-Yeah.
13603110 13605779 This moment here<br />is probably my favorite moment
13605946 13609533 out of the entire trilogy, I would say.
13622254 13624904 This is a moment<br />when there's always a huge sniffle
13625048 13627050 in the audience when the film's playing.
13627134 13629511 And it's usually me.
13632055 13634974 It's interesting with the ending,<br />because this whole sequence
13635058 13638102 has copped, I guess,<br />the most criticism of <i>Return of the King.</i>
13638186 13641314 I wonder whether some of the criticism<br />was due to the bladder factor.
13641398 13643399 When I think, a lot of people,<br />they were getting to this point
13643483 13646319 they were just wanting the film to end<br />so they could rush out to the toilet.
13646403 13649989 So the fact that there was scene after<br />scene after scene for another 20 minutes
13650073 13652409 that possibly accentuated the sort of...
13652576 13655579 The whole multiple-ending thing<br />for some people.
13657456 13658665 -Oh.<br />-Now this...
13658832 13662669 This is interesting, this stuff here,<br />because we actually shot a little epilogue
13662753 13665004 that's for the other characters,<br />that we never used.
13665088 13667090 And I'm not using it<br />in the Extended Cut either
13667174 13669426 because it just doesn't really need it.
13669593 13672262 But we did a little bit of showing
13672429 13677684 what happened to Legolas,<br />to Gimli, to Faramir and Éowyn.
13682773 13685316 The scenes that have gone in<br />are the scenes that I just thought
13685400 13686484 would be fun to have in.
13686568 13688111 And... And fun is actually the word.
13688195 13692282 Not because they need to be in to<br />make the film better, not because they...
13692449 13695327 Putting them in<br />sometimes can make the film worse.
13695494 13697871 But those are not the reasons why.
13698038 13701124 The reasons why is that I think<br />they're just fun to have in and...
13701208 13703668 And, you know, the scenes that I don't<br />think are particularly fun to put in
13703752 13705962 I don't put it in, you know.<br />It's just that's...
13706046 13708548 Actually, fun is kind of<br />the best way to describe it.
13708632 13709682 I'm not... I'm not...
13709800 13714513 I don't make any decisions<br />any deeper than that, really.
13719142 13722479 This scene in the pub here is actually<br />one that we shot in pickups.
13722646 13725523 That... That all of the rest of the...<br />Of this last 20 minutes, is...
13725607 13728609 Most of it is original footage<br />that we did in our principal photography.
13728693 13731822 But this one sequence here,<br />we didn't have.
13731988 13734907 Oh, and Sam's wedding, too.<br />We didn't have. Those two sequences.
13734991 13737035 But this was important to me
13737202 13740497 because I felt that it actually<br />was what Tolkien had in mind.
13740664 13742206 And I wanted to dramatize it
13742290 13745293 because he had been a soldier<br />in the First World War.
13745460 13746753 And one of the things that...
13746837 13749964 That just about all veterans<br />of the First World War talk about
13750048 13752049 is the sense of coming home<br />to their families,
13752133 13754928 and their village, where they left from,
13755095 13758348 and they've been thoroughly changed<br />by the experience.
13758515 13760808 They've gone through horrors<br />that they could never describe.
13760892 13762769 And they literally couldn't talk<br />to anyone about it,
13762853 13764855 so therefore nobody understood.
13765021 13769071 And the only people that understood were<br />those other friends that had been to war.
13769234 13772988 And I wanted that feeling amongst<br />those four guys, that they were there,
13773154 13776616 but no one else knew<br />how heroic they really were.
13776783 13780328 And they didn't expect to be<br />treated like heroes either.
13780495 13783706 And I thought that was very true<br />to what Tolkien would have experienced
13783790 13786125 coming back from<br />the First World War, himself.
13786209 13787544 And then we didn't have...
13787711 13791381 We didn't have Sam's wedding<br />originally shot, either.
13791548 13795635 And we thought that this was a pickup<br />that we should do. It was worth doing.
13803059 13805394 ...I think that we should bear<br />some responsibility for that...
13805478 13807105 ...in terms of the storytelling.
13807272 13810149 Ultimate... Ultimately, if the point<br />is about the destruction of Frodo
13810233 13813361 then the audience<br />should be given that expectation
13813737 13815780 that they will know then<br />that there is more to come.
13815864 13818282 -But we never actually made that point.<br />-No, we didn't.
13818366 13819951 And if we had...
13820118 13823371 You know, had a bit more time,<br />dare I say, to shape the story
13823538 13825998 we could've... We probably would've<br />got there in the end, you know.
13826082 13828334 -We would have got there in the end.<br />-We'd have found a way to do that,
13828418 13830670 but we ran out of time to shape the end
13830837 13834387 in the way that I think we probably<br />could've alleviated some of this.
13838136 13840721 I remember I had a line in there<br />that was Frodo in VO going:
13840805 13843975 "Bilbo always told me<br />that the great stories never end."
13844142 13846102 -And Fran was saying...<br />-I wouldn't let her use it.
13846186 13848786 You wouldn't... You wouldn't let us<br />put it in there
13848897 13850857 because she was terrified<br />that it would point out
13850941 13853041 the fact that the story's never-ending.
13859991 13864371 That back shot of Frodo is referencing<br />the back shot on Bilbo.
13869876 13873171 The effects of this journey,<br />because this is...
13873338 13876688 This is some two or three years after<br />they've gotten home, isn't it?
13876841 13881388 And we... We did makeup on Elijah,<br />just make him seem pale and gaunt
13881554 13884808 like the color's never quite<br />come back into his cheeks.
13884975 13887686 And we wanted him to feel very...
13887978 13891228 I mean, "depressed" is not quite<br />the right word, but... But the...
13891314 13894066 The way that we shot the scene was<br />with colors that were sort of muted.
13894150 13897950 Everything was in shades of brown.<br />There wasn't any bright colors on the set.
13898071 13899739 We made sure the costumes weren't bright.
13899823 13905078 We did a lot of just subtle things to try<br />to... To make the whole atmosphere seem drab.
13907998 13909582 He's not going to get better.
13917465 13919718 But no mind, we got there in the end.
13931062 13933023 Is that Elijah's last shot, Pete?
13936526 13938876 In fact, the...<br />The bit at the end when he says:
13939487 13942387 "There's room for a little more,"<br />was the very last moment.
13943533 13945785 But we had Elijah recording<br />a lot more voice-over,
13945869 13948246 but it just felt too... Too much talking.
13948413 13950456 I can't even remember now<br />what we ended up using.
13950540 13954640 Not... Not a great deal, because a lot of<br />this just played better with music and...
13955462 13958562 -No, we used... There's some... Some...<br />-I don't quite... Yeah.
13959674 13961124 -...wrote and recorded.<br />-Yeah.
13963887 13965846 These were second-unit shots<br />done on Matamata
13965930 13967974 on the same farm as where<br />Hobbiton was built.
13968058 13970708 It was just around the corner<br />from Hobbiton, actually.
13972228 13974314 And this was
13974689 13976232 shot a long time ago.
13976399 13979318 That's a long, long time ago,<br />when Ian Holm was out in New Zealand
13979402 13981863 doing the stuff for<br /><i>Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
13982030 13984323 Because Ian...<br />Bilbo didn't appear in <i>The Two Towers,</i>
13984407 13987410 and he was just in this last sequence in
13987577 13990080 <i>Return of the King,</i><br />but as a much older Bilbo.
13990246 13994334 And so Richard Taylor did this<br />prosthetic makeup and Gino and...
13994501 13996669 I know that Ian Holm was very taken<br />with the... With the makeup.
13996753 14000631 He loved standing in front of the mirror<br />and looking at it and playing with it.
14000715 14002341 I think he was very impressed with it.
14002425 14003927 It is pretty nice. It's a...
14004094 14008014 Old-men makeup is<br />a difficult thing to do,
14008389 14011184 and I... And I think this<br />works pretty well.
14013937 14015730 Grey Havens is another one<br />of those places
14015814 14018065 that hasn't really been illustrated<br />a great deal.
14018149 14020609 There's... There's a couple of<br />nice paintings that...
14020693 14023113 That have been done with it.
14023279 14026366 But I let...<br />We let Alan Lee go crazy on it.
14026533 14028909 And I remember actually<br />we were shooting in Hobbiton
14028993 14033748 the actual village of Hobbiton, when<br />Alan came on set one day in a windy field,
14033915 14038545 and was showing me his first<br />drawings of... Of the Grey Havens.
14039170 14040922 And...
14041089 14043841 And the very first drawing that<br />Alan ever showed me, I just said:
14043925 14046927 "Yep, that's perfect. That's exactly<br />what we... What we want to do."
14047011 14049263 And we never changed it, actually.<br />We never changed the concept
14049347 14052767 from that very first sketch<br />of this incredible harbor with these
14052851 14056062 buildings up the sides<br />of the harbor and towers.
14056479 14058398 And it was very Elvish.
14058565 14060775 Because I've never quite imagined<br />what the Grey Havens looks like.
14060859 14061985 No.
14066281 14068825 ...that this was meant<br />to represent death...
14068992 14070535 ...or at least in our minds...
14070702 14074330 ...whether or not that's what<br />Professor Tolkien was signifying.
14074497 14076332 That's what we wanted it to be.
14076499 14079794 And the fact that... That...
14079961 14082672 That if you're mortal<br />and you get on that boat
14082839 14088261 it... It's basically saying that you are<br />dying, and that's in fact what Frodo's doing.
14088428 14091639 A lot of people pick up on it,<br />but some people don't.
14096394 14099189 ...spiritually not... Not going to death.
14102775 14104736 ...but he's not coming back.
14109490 14111840 She was only in New Zealand<br />for about two weeks.
14111951 14114286 And she shot all of her scenes<br />for <i>The Fellowship of the Ring.</i>
14114370 14116288 And then all of her<br />little bits and pieces
14116372 14118791 appearing in <i>The Two Towers</i><br />and <i>Return of the King</i>
14118875 14120042 were all shot at the same time.
14120126 14122503 And we needed Cate to be here<br />at the Grey Havens,
14122587 14125256 but it wasn't when we were shooting<br />the scene with the rest of the guys.
14125340 14129051 So we shot her all by herself against<br />blue screen, doing her little moments.
14129135 14130636 And that was... Was shot with her
14130720 14133472 several months before we did the rest<br />of the scene with everybody else.
14133556 14135474 So we didn't even quite know<br />what the scene was gonna be like
14135558 14137560 7... when we shot her shots.
14143399 14145484 That... That's only recently<br />turned up, hasn't it?
14145568 14146611 Yeah.
14149656 14152283 And they... They will understand<br />the meaning of it
14152450 14156579 because we never really got into<br />what the power of the three Rings were,
14156746 14160750 or, in fact, who the three Ring...<br />Ring-bearers of the Elven Rings were.
14160917 14163753 But they are in fact, Elrond
14163920 14168716 Galadriel, as she shows Frodo in...<br />In... In <i>Fellowship,</i>
14168883 14174097 and Gandalf. And you'll see here that<br />he is wearing Narya, the Ring of Fire.
14174264 14175890 Yeah.
14183898 14186233 And I don't mean that in the sense<br />of it being emotional
14186317 14190029 because that was okay and... And<br />the guys were doing an amazing job.
14190196 14193366 But we shot this scene in one day
14193533 14196452 very, very difficult, very emotional
14196619 14201207 lots of tears, because, you know,<br />they're not pretending.
14201374 14204710 They're... They're doing this stuff for real<br />to get themselves worked up into the emotion.
14204794 14209841 And we looked at it the following day,<br />and most of the footage was out of focus.
14210008 14214137 It was actually one of the most disastrous<br />days of shooting that we ever did.
14214304 14215971 Particularly because of what it was.
14216055 14221185 It was, like, we could not believe that<br />it was out of focus, most of the footage.
14221352 14224814 And we actually...<br />I had to break the news to the guys.
14224981 14228531 I remember walking on set and saying,<br />"You know that Grey Havens stuff?"
14228651 14232029 "Yeah, yeah." "Well, I had a look<br />at the... At the dailies last night."
14232113 14236743 "Oh, yeah, yeah?"<br />"And it was all out of focus."
14236868 14238744 And I remember them looking at me.<br />And I remember them saying:
14238828 14240955 "You... You're joking right?<br />You're kidding.
14241039 14242389 Yeah, this is not serious."
14243166 14245542 And I had to say, "Yeah,<br />and we're gonna have to reshoot it."
14245626 14248504 And we actually had to go back<br />and film it again.
14248671 14250589 And, you know,<br />it's one of those weird things
14250673 14254093 where you never quite know whether<br />it was as good the second time around.
14254177 14257680 I mean, I think it was, and I certainly<br />think they're doing an amazing job here.
14257764 14260683 But, you know, that's...
14265855 14268816 -No, it wasn't. It was another focus puller.<br />-He didn't bugger this scene up.
14268900 14270693 -It was...<br />-No, no, somebody else.
14270860 14272862 Colin had gone to Australia, and
14273029 14276783 shortly thereafter<br />we begged him to return.
14296636 14299736 -And I just think it's beautiful.<br />-Yeah, that's very beautiful.
14305395 14308314 You know what I always remember, too,<br />when you talk about multiple endings?
14308398 14312485 And I... I think people have<br />to understand that this...
14312652 14317407 We're not ending one film,<br />as you said, Pete, we're ending three.
14317573 14320243 And this scene in particular<br />is doing that.
14323746 14325846 -That's the problem.<br />-That's not a problem.
14328126 14330169 ...and, you know, the vast majority do...
14330253 14332504 ...are people who were never gonna<br />engage in these movies...
14332588 14335638 -...or they engage in it to a certain...<br />-I think that's true.
14338428 14340846 I think some people like certain types<br />of films, and other people don't.
14340930 14343640 And... And... And, you know, no one's<br />gonna buy into any of this stuff
14343724 14346374 if they fundamentally don't like<br /><i>Lord of the Rings.</i>
14350606 14351899 ...and seeing it with the guys.
14351983 14353359 -Seeing it with Elijah...<br />-Yeah.
14353443 14355695 -...and Billy and Dom and you.<br />-Yeah.
14355862 14358614 And it was phenomenal, and it worked.
14362577 14365329 ...who aren't familiar with the book,<br />they really are in the dark here.
14365413 14367498 When does this movie end, exactly?
14367665 14369459 I would have no idea, because…
14376716 14378926 And you have the gigantic<br />climatic sequence,
14379010 14382429 and you have a small wrap-out, kind<br />of coda, which may be a few minutes...
14382513 14384556 You know, there's only really one way<br />of knowing...
14384640 14386590 And 20 minutes later, we're still here.
14389353 14392148 ...and that's a... A Jell-O wrestle.
14392315 14395765 Where everybody that likes the...<br />Likes the endings goes on one side,
14395902 14398904 and everybody that doesn't goes on<br />the other, and they just wrestle it out
14398988 14400823 in a big pit of Jell-O.
14400990 14403242 And the ones that are left standing<br />at the end, are right.
14403326 14405676 And that's the only way to really<br />figure it out.
14406996 14408998 I think he's right.
14417882 14420426 I've worked with Sean's dad. John Astin,
14420593 14422428 and with Sean, and now Ally.
14422595 14424945 So I've worked with<br />three generations of Astins.
14426224 14427624 This is kind of interesting.
14427767 14430853 And I remember this day in particular,<br />another one of those little memories.
14430937 14434773 I was... I was... I was standing here<br />with Sean as we were shooting this scene.
14434857 14439654 And I said to him...<br />Because this was January 2000,
14439820 14441780 and I remember saying to him,<br />"You know what, Sean?
14441864 14443449 The scene that we're shooting<br />at the moment
14443533 14447036 it's gonna be nearly four years<br />before anybody sees this."
14447203 14449830 And... It both... It's, you know...<br />We looked at each other,
14449914 14452374 and it just seemed like<br />an incredible thought at the time.
14452458 14453625 And, you know, it's amazing.
14453709 14455544 It's amazing to me now<br />that four years has gone by,
14455628 14457588 and I'm looking at this, and I remem...<br />Remember that comment.
14457672 14459322 -And that's Sarah's...<br />-Sarah's...
14461551 14463594 Right. Oh, that was Sarah's baby.<br />Yeah, of course it was.
14463678 14467098 So, like, Sean and Sarah<br />both had their kids there.
14467306 14468933 Yeah.
14479569 14481821 I always wanted to end on the Hobbit.
14486075 14488327 -Because that's a...<br />-Yeah, that was obviously important, yeah.
14488411 14490705 That at least after everything we've done
14490871 14493221 we ended up on the same page<br />at the very end.
14495751 14498963 -That's right.<br />-...we honored the last line.
14504302 14508013 We just had the credits beginning,<br />and we kept the credits just very basic
14508097 14510975 which were just white letters<br />on black background.
14511142 14513894 And then because<br />this is truly the last credits
14514061 14516772 these are the genuine final credits.
14516939 14519733 I wanted them to feel like<br />they're the end of the three films.
14519817 14523070 So that you could chop the credits<br />off the first two almost,
14523237 14526198 and join it all together,<br />and these would become the final credits.
14526282 14528492 So I wanted them to look<br />and feel different
14528576 14531287 which is why we had Alan Lee do sketches.
14531454 14534790 Alan didn't actually do<br />many sketches for this.
14534957 14537042 We... We just looked in his...<br />In his notebook
14537126 14538210 because he kept these original...
14538294 14540796 These amazing sketch pads, or notebooks
14540963 14543006 all the way through the six years<br />he's worked on the films.
14543090 14547303 And we went through and raided a<br />lot of his little sketches and doodles
14547470 14550056 to be in the background of these shots.
14550222 14553059 And then we had Alan sketch<br />the actors' faces, though.
14553225 14554893 They were... They were special sketches
14554977 14556937 that he did just for this credit roll.
14557021 14558647 I just wanted to do something that...
14558731 14560899 And I... I loved the idea,<br />it was actually something
14560983 14562734 that I was talking about once<br />with Ian McKellen.
14562818 14565988 And we were talking about<br />how in the old movies
14566155 14569200 it was a particular fad<br />in the '60s, from memory
14569367 14571994 where you would sometimes have credits
14572161 14575330 where there'd be little shots of actors<br />when their names come up.
14575414 14577916 And sometimes they sort of would smile<br />or acknowledge the camera,
14578000 14580002 and do a little nod of the head.
14584340 14587759 -...this... These particular images.<br />-Yeah, we... We picked stills of the actors...
14587843 14591764 ...and then we had Alan sketch on them,<br />and then we sort of did a half mixture.
14591931 14594392 They... They're not pure sketches<br />you're seeing.
14594558 14599188 They're sketches with a little mix<br />of actors' skin tones and flesh tones
14599355 14601857 just very subtly underneath.
14609031 14611283 I remember when we were having<br />a meeting about
14611367 14614412 who was gonna do the vocals for the...<br />For the end song.
14614578 14618541 And... Actually, we hadn't decided<br />whether it was gonna be male or female,
14618708 14622211 but then we decided that...<br />Who...? Who was it?
14622378 14627258 The question was, who was the voice<br />of this final song gonna be?
14627425 14631053 And we decided<br />it was gonna be Galadriel, really,
14631220 14636642 and that led you back to a very, very<br />early thought you'd had, a long time ago
14636809 14638977 one of your favorite singers,<br />Annie Lennox
14639061 14640771 whose voice you've always loved.
14640855 14642398 And you... And it was...
14642565 14645067 When you said it, it was so right.
14645234 14646777 It was one of those thoughts<br />that was so right
14646861 14649488 that everybody in the room got it<br />and understood it.
14649572 14653409 And thank God she said yes.<br />She did a phenomenal job.
14656370 14658748 And you never know really
14658914 14662042 -when... When you don't have any...<br />-No.
14662209 14664378 ...personal experience of someone,<br />how it's going to be.
14664462 14667712 -Yeah, collaboratively.<br />-But it just turned out to be really good.
14678684 14682480 ...she would be the right person and...<br />And she so was.
14686942 14688944 ...a young man called Cameron Duncan.
14693324 14694700 ...to complete <i>The Return of the King...</i>
14694784 14698621 ...we met Cameron, who's a...<br />A young New Zealand filmmaker.
14698788 14700956 He was 16 years old at the time.
14701123 14704794 And he was a very...<br />A very gifted filmmaker.
14708005 14710048 Yeah, right, you see a lot of work<br />from young filmmakers,
14710132 14713552 and this kid was the real thing.<br />It was, like, stunning, actually
14713636 14715095 -just how clever he was...<br />-Yeah.
14715179 14717765 -...frightening at that... That age. Yeah.<br />-Yeah.
14721268 14723118 ...when we were shooting the pickups.
14723270 14727858 And he... It was a great thrill for him<br />to watch everything happening.
14728025 14730319 -Yeah, yeah.<br />-But Cameron had had
14730486 14733072 cancer the year before.
14733239 14736033 And during the...
14736242 14741872 Early in 2003, he had a diagnosis<br />of secondary... Relapse.
14742039 14744834 He had metastases that were found<br />in his lungs.
14745000 14746752 And so it was throughout that year
14746836 14750464 he also underwent various forms<br />of... Of chemotherapy.
14750631 14754481 And so his time with us was limited<br />because it would be in between treatments.
14754635 14757935 He'd be... He'd be going away<br />overseas to... To receive treatments.
14758055 14760307 And he was getting sicker.
14760724 14765521 And when we were in England<br />in August and writing
14765688 14767522 we were thinking about writing this song.
14767606 14772152 Cameron was very much with us in...<br />Certainly in spirit.
14772319 14773445 He was... He was actually getting...
14773529 14776031 He was getting chemo<br />at that time in New Zealand,
14776198 14778450 but he was calling us and e-mailing us.
14778534 14781036 -And he was making a little film.<br />-He was making a... A short film.
14781120 14782329 <i>-Strike Zone.</i> Yep.<br />-Another short film
14782413 14785249 which is called <i>Strike Zone,</i> which
14785416 14787418 -is a great testament to him...<br />-Yeah.
14787585 14790337 ...and... You know, his abilities<br />as a filmmaker...
14790504 14792840 ...and just who he is as a person.
14793007 14799346 And... And it was during that time<br />that it became more apparent to me
14799513 14803726 that he wasn't probably gonna<br />beat this thing
14803893 14809023 even though that wasn't something that<br />you like... You let yourself think about.
14809189 14812025 It felt like that he probably wasn't<br />gonna beat the cancer.
14812109 14814778 And so it was... It was odd
14814945 14819450 because of... The song is very much<br />about, you know, Frodo's passing.
14819617 14823996 But it, personally, for me,<br />was also about
14824163 14828584 reconciling the conflicted feelings<br />about lit... Cameron,
14828751 14832004 and what he was facing.
14832171 14833756 And…
14836800 14840012 We're having to write this with Annie.<br />And it was one job
14840179 14842681 on top of everything else that you were<br />doing with the film at the time.
14842765 14845515 You were doing ADR.<br />You were helping me with the edit
14845601 14846935 trying to fix the problems of the film.
14847019 14848895 And you had these lyrics to write,<br />and you were struggling.
14848979 14852942 And I remember it was only when you<br />sort of made a conscious decision
14853108 14856612 to write the song about Cameron<br />that it suddenly just went click.
14856779 14857780 -Didn't it?<br />-Yeah.
14857947 14859322 It was that sort of moment<br />when you decided
14859406 14861032 -it was about something...<br />-Yeah.
14861116 14863661 -...that you... That you cared about.<br />-Yeah.
14863827 14867748 -Yeah, and it...<br />-Or somebody.
14870000 14872002 So...
14872169 14874880 And Cameron, in fact, he...
14875047 14877883 Philippa and I, on the day that we...
14878050 14882304 We were done with editing the film,<br />it was in November
14882471 14887476 of 2003
14887643 14888978 we...
14889144 14890437 Philippa and I went out.
14890604 14892564 -We went... We were...<br />-We went shopping.
14892648 14895609 Shopping. And Cameron at that point,<br />he had gone to Houston...
14895693 14898486 To a hospital in Houston to have<br />an experimental chemo
14898570 14902032 to try and beat these<br />fast-growing tumors in his lungs.
14902199 14905327 And we got home<br />from our first day out, wasn't it?
14909289 14913168 ...what next, and what if this doesn't<br />work? This treatment doesn't work?
14913335 14915754 And we had driven home<br />from Eastbourne the whole way.
14915838 14919675 And I put the song on<br />because I'd fallen in love with it and...
14919842 14923846 And... And we were playing it and...
14924013 14926890 But we were feeling like,<br />"Well, there's maybe this,
14927057 14931228 and he can look at doing this."<br />And... Anyway, we got home.
14933731 14937609 ...which was very unusual<br />to find him there.
14937776 14940738 And he told us that Cameron had died
14941030 14942614 a few hours earlier.
14942781 14944575 And...
14944950 14947494 And it was odd, because it was...<br />I mean, it was...
14947661 14951623 It was terribly shocking to me,<br />even though I had...
14951790 14955711 Knew that I had... Should expect it.<br />It was incredibly shocking.
14955878 14959715 And... And...
14959882 14964720 It was... It kind of came at the end of...<br />Right at the end of the film.
14964887 14967848 It was like two things coming together.
14968015 14970433 It was a great shame he never saw it,<br />in fact, because...
14970517 14972644 -I know, that's the one thing...<br />-I know. He loved it.
14972728 14975146 ...is that he would have loved<br />to have seen the film.
14975230 14978150 And he... His body was<br />brought back on the...
14978317 14980277 Weirdly, on the Air New Zealand plane
14980444 14983363 that had Frodo painted on the side,<br />which...
14983530 14985930 -Which... His family...<br />-Which he would've loved.
14986075 14987909 ...brought him back,<br />Sharon and Rhys and...
14987993 14989943 And Tarryn and Chanel brought him home.
14995250 15000756 I mean, that was the first time that anybody<br />had ever heard the song outside of us
15000923 15003342 was we played it at his funeral.
15003509 15005260 -Yeah.<br />-So that...
15005427 15008597 You know, the song has a...<br />Has a connection,
15008764 15011475 for us with Cameron that's...<br />That is very profound.
15011642 15014269 Yep. We did...
15021318 15024196 I know all kids are special,<br />but he was extra special.
15024822 15027282 And a lot of people felt it.
15031870 15034790 ...to the fans out there, thank you.
15034957 15038707 The ones... Especially the ones who<br />have bothered to listen to us raving on.
15041839 15044591 Can we...? Can we say thank you to them?
15044758 15047177 Because you did...
15047344 15051431 In the end, you did inspire us,<br />and you did keep us on our toes and...
15051515 15053183 -Yeah, I... I agree with that.<br />-You did make us wanna...
15053267 15054434 I agree with that. I mean, I...
15054518 15057768 -You know, it... It's... It's...<br />-You're a big part of this movie.
15060649 15063943 And, you know, you get a lot of letters<br />with people's ideas, you know:
15064027 15065695 "Why don't you do this.<br />Why don't you do that?"
15065779 15068114 And that... That's not really<br />how fans influence you.
15068198 15070409 But what... What it is
15070576 15074329 is it's the realization that there's<br />such an expectation out there
15074496 15078041 that you become terrified of...<br />Of letting the fans down.
15078208 15081586 And it... And it's the fear factor.<br />Which is actually a valuable thing
15081670 15084506 because I think fear is<br />a great motivating force.
15084673 15087425 And you... You realize<br />you have a responsibility to people
15087509 15090303 who care so much about this book,<br />not to let them down.
15090387 15095267 And I've really appreciated that. I've<br />actually appreciated all of the fans'...
15095434 15097060 Their... Their enjoyment of these films
15097144 15099646 and... And the sense of responsibility<br />that that's given us
15099730 15101898 to have to deliver them<br />the best possible film we could make.
15101982 15105861 Because that forces us to go above
15106028 15108738 where we might naturally<br />have stopped in our standards.
15108822 15111199 But we go further<br />because there's other people
15111283 15113618 -that care so much about this, not just us.<br />-Yeah.
15113702 15117205 And that's actually a really valuable thing,<br />and I... And I feel... Feel so grateful.
15117289 15121126 I think it has had a significant impact<br />on shaping these films.
15121293 15122669 Yeah.
15126215 15130135 A bit like Frodo on the rock,<br />"It's over. It's done."
15134348 15137226 Is that the concept of...<br />Of it being done
15137392 15140312 is only just very minor<br />in the sense of our own work.
15140479 15143064 You know, okay, we don't have to<br />go in and mix the film anymore.
15143148 15145525 We don't have to look at<br />visual-effects shots anymore.
15145609 15147194 But, man, this is never done.
15147361 15150029 This is gonna be part of our lives for...<br />Till the day we die.
15150113 15152657 I mean, that's the...<br />The reality of it is now that you...
15152741 15155577 This is something that's so big<br />that you can't walk away from it.
15155661 15158580 So the... So... So the concept<br />like a normal movie...
15158747 15160373 And we've done it in the past<br />with other films
15160457 15163543 where you can say, "Okay, that film is<br />finished. We're moving on to our next film."
15163627 15165254 And you literally... The...
15165504 15167923 The other films do fade away eventually.
15168090 15171176 You know, especially some of the...<br />The early films we've made.
15171260 15174346 And you literally, you know,<br />hardly ever hear of them again.
15174513 15176682 But this one isn't gonna be like that.
15176848 15181270 This one is gonna be there,<br />big, front and center, for evermore.
15181436 15183355 Absolutely.
15186066 15188116 ...and you go through,<br />and you follow Sam?
15189569 15191819 -Oh, they got lost on... Last Friday.<br />-Did it?
15194116 15196117 I think that we lo...<br />When we lost that footage
15196201 15199705 we really lost the true <i>rappel</i> on the...<br />On the film.
15203292 15205001 -The kids were incredible.<br />-That sort of jumping forward.
15205085 15207585 -With Merry and Pippin.<br />-And... And Frodo grown up.
15213593 15215929 ...where Sam goes to the post office<br />to check his mail the following day.
15216013 15219558 And the scene where he takes his dog<br />to the vet was also a great one.
15220809 15223312 So we just need to
15223478 15226898 let these people get to bed, and we... We<br />better go looking for this lost footage.
15226982 15230232 -I'm a bit disturbed about that.<br />-I know, you've lost a lot of it.
15230319 15231903 -Yeah.<br />-How...? How much do you think
15231987 15234437 -that lost footage is valued at?<br />-I don't know.
15236575 15237659 Okay.
15237826 15239411 -So thank you.<br />-Thank you.
15239578 15241538 Yes, thank you.
