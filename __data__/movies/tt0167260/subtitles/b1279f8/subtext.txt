659366 662578 We are sitting on a field of victory...
662744 666206 ...enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
667291 671128 The salted pork is particularly good.
671670 674047 Salted pork?
674756 678677 -Huh. Hobbits.<br />-We're under orders from Treebeard...

700574 702576 ...locked in his tower.
705245 706580 Show yourself.
706830 708540 Be careful.
709291 711960 Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.
712127 714213 Well, let's just have his head<br />and be done with it.
714379 716465 No.
716798 719134 We need him alive.
720135 722679 We need him to talk.
724556 728810 SARUMAN: You have fought many wars<br />and slain many men, Théoden King...
728977 730479 ...and made peace afterwards.
730646 735567 Can we not take counsel together<br />as we once did, my old friend?
735776 738987 Can we not have peace, you and I?
739154 741031 We shall have peace.
742991 745077 We shall have peace...
745285 749331 ...when you answer<br />for the burning of the Westfold...
749498 752209 ...and the children that lie dead there!
753001 757172 We shall have peace<br />when the lives of the soldiers...
757339 759383 ...whose bodies were hewn<br />even as they lay dead...
759549 763095 ...against the gates of the Hornburg,<br />are avenged!
764680 770227 When you hang from a gibbet<br />for the sport of your own crows...
771186 773397 ...we shall have peace.
776191 778860 Gibbets and crows?
779194 780445 Dotard!
781905 784741 What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?
785742 788245 <i>Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.</i>
788412 791373 Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dûr itself...
791540 795544 ...along with the crowns of the seven kings<br />and the rods of the Five Wizards!
795711 798630 Your treachery has already cost<br />many lives.
798839 801216 Thousands more are now at risk.
801383 803719 But you could save them, Saruman.
803885 806221 You were deep in the enemy's counsel.
806388 809641 So you have come here for information.
810559 812394 I have some for you.
817858 820777 Something festers<br />in the heart of Middle-earth.
820944 823238 Something that you have failed to see.
825741 829244 But the Great Eye has seen it.
830245 833957 Even now he presses his advantage.
835751 839087 His attack will come soon.
841256 843425 You're all going to die.
845927 849139 But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?
849306 853935 You cannot think that this Ranger<br />will ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.
854102 860192 This exile, crept from the shadows,<br />will never be crowned king.
861526 865197 Gandalf does not hesitate<br />to sacrifice those closest to him...
866114 868325 ...those he professes to love.
869409 873955 Tell me, what words of comfort<br />did you give the Halfling...
874122 876500 ...before you sent him to his doom?
876666 878585 [SIGHS]
879544 884299 The path that you have set him on<br />can only lead to death.
884633 886802 I've heard enough!
886968 888804 Shoot him.<br />Stick an arrow in his gob.
889304 890972 GANDALF:<br />No.
891431 893642 Come down, Saruman...
893809 897729 -...and your life will be spared.<br />-Save your pity and your mercy.
897938 899231 I have no use for it!
908532 909991 GANDALF:<br />Saruman...
911034 912994 ...your staff is broken.
913161 915038 [GASPS]
925006 928510 Gríma, you need not follow him.
929678 932347 You were not always as you are now.
932514 935350 You were once a Man of Rohan.
935517 936726 Come down.
936893 939604 A Man of Rohan?
940522 942774 What is the house of Rohan...
942983 946611 ...but a thatched barn<br />where brigands drink in the reek...
946778 950532 ...and their brats roll on the floor<br />with the dogs?
951032 957497 The victory at Helm's Deep does not<br />belong to you, Théoden Horse-master.
958081 962711 You are a lesser son of greater sires.
965046 966715 <i>Gríma...</i>
967549 969426 ...come down.
969759 971219 Be free of him.
971386 975390 -Free? He will never be free.<br />-No.
975724 978393 Get down, cur!
978560 979895 [GRUNTS]
980061 981396 Saruman!

988403 993617 You withdraw your guard, and I will tell you<br />where your doom will be decided.

1413161 1416664 What's it saying, my precious, my love?
1416831 1420460 Is Sméagol losing his nerve?
1421085 1423504 No. Not.
1423671 1427884 Never. Sméagol hates nasty Hobbitses.
1428051 1432889 Sméagol wants to see them dead.
1433056 1435600 And we will.
1435767 1439854 Sméagol did it once.<br />He can do it again.

1456412 1460792 First we must lead them to her.
1461709 1466714 We lead them to the Winding Stair.

1469717 1472720 Up, up, up, up,<br />up the stairs we go...
1472887 1479268 ...until we come to the tunnel.
1479644 1482772 And when they go in...
1482939 1485733 ...there's no coming out.
1486651 1489570 She's always hungry.
1490279 1494492 She always needs to feed.
1494659 1496077 She must eat.
1496244 1498413 All she gets is filthy Orcses.
1498579 1501290 And they doesn't taste very nice,<br />does they, precious?
1501916 1503584 No.
1503751 1508423 Not very nice at all, my love.
1508589 1511426 She hungers for sweeter meats.
1511592 1513428 Hobbit meat.
1513594 1518433 And when she throws away the bones<br />and the empty clothes...
1518599 1521644 ...then we will find it.
1521811 1526149 And take it for me!
1527942 1529318 For us.
1529819 1532822 Yes. We meant "for us."
1532989 1536451 Gollum. Gollum.

1552967 1554594 No, Sam! Leave him alone!
1555470 1558139 I heard it from his own mouth.<br />He means to murder us.
1558306 1562477 Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly.

1591172 1594759 We can't do this by ourselves, Sam.<br />Not without a guide.
1595635 1598513 I need you on my side.
1599263 1601641 I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.
1603142 1606062 I know, Sam. I know.
1606646 1608606 Trust me.
1608773 1611192 Come, Sméagol.
1624038 1626415 [SNORING]
1679093 1680595 What time is it?
1682930 1684432 Not yet dawn.
1691314 1694358 I dreamed I saw a great wave...
1694525 1698529 ...climbing over green lands<br />and above the hills.
1699780 1702283 I stood upon the brink.
1703159 1706329 It was utterly dark in the abyss<br />before my feet.
1708289 1711042 A light shone behind me...
1711667 1714128 ...but I could not turn.
1714295 1717673 I could only stand there, waiting.
1719133 1721844 Night changes many thoughts.
1722261 1724388 Sleep, Éowyn.
1724972 1727183 Sleep...
1729894 1731812 ...while you can.
1755920 1758214 The stars are veiled.
1759215 1762718 Something stirs in the east.
1763386 1766514 A sleepless malice.
1768599 1771394 The Eye of the enemy is moving.
1784824 1787535 MERRY:<br />What are you doing?
1789912 1791998 [SNORING LIGHTLY]
1792164 1793624 MERRY [WHISPERING]:<br />Pippin!

1817732 1820401 -What, are you mad?<br />-I just want to look at it.
1820568 1821652 Just one more time.
1821902 1823988 MERRY:<br />Put it back.
1834248 1836083 Pippin.

1891847 1893099 Fool of a Took!
1905569 1907655 [WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY]
1911659 1913953 [GASPING]
1914203 1916414 Look at me.
1918374 1922503 Gandalf, forgive me.
1922670 1924547 GANDALF:<br />Look at me.
1924713 1926549 What did you see?
1930052 1932138 A tree.
1933097 1934974 There was a white tree...
1935141 1936642 ...in a courtyard of stone.
1939437 1940729 It was dead.
1944900 1946735 The city was burning.
1946902 1950281 Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
1950948 1952992 I saw...
1956370 1957746 I saw him.
1960749 1963002 I could hear his voice in my head.
1963169 1965588 And what did you tell him?
1965754 1967590 Speak!
1971760 1974930 He asked me my name.<br />I didn't answer.
1975097 1976557 He hurt me.
1976724 1979185 What did you tell him<br />about Frodo and the Ring?
1982688 1985149 There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.
1985983 1988235 A fool...
1988402 1990696 ...but an honest fool he remains.
1991155 1994700 He told Sauron nothing<br />of Frodo and the Ring.
1995743 1998120 We've been strangely fortunate.
1998287 2002166 Pippin saw in the palantír<br />a glimpse of the enemy's plan.
2003083 2007046 Sauron moves to strike<br />the city of Mines Tirith.
2007630 2011383 His defeat at Helm's Deep<br />showed our enemy one thing.
2011550 2013886 He knows the heir of Elendil<br />has come forth.
2014053 2016180 Men are not as weak as he supposed.
2016347 2020142 There is courage still, strength<br />enough perhaps to challenge him.
2020351 2022228 Sauron fears this.
2022394 2026732 He will not risk the peoples of<br />Middle-earth uniting under one banner.
2027900 2030319 He will raze Minas Tirith<br />to the ground...
2030486 2033989 ...before he sees a king<br />return to the throne of Men.
2034156 2038077 If the beacons of Gondor are lit,<br />Rohan must be ready for war.
2038994 2041205 Tell me...
2041372 2045167 ...why should we ride to the aid<br />of those who did not come to ours?
2049046 2050881 What do we owe Gondor?
2052007 2054051 -I will go.<br />-No!
2054218 2057388 -They must be warned.<br />-They will be.
2060808 2063352 You must come to Minas Tirith<br />by another road.
2063894 2068357 Follow the river.<br />Look to the black ships.
2069316 2071277 Understand this:
2071443 2075114 Things are now in motion<br />that cannot be undone.
2076615 2078701 I ride for Minas Tirith...
2080953 2083622 ...and I won't be going alone.
2085374 2089044 Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,<br />Peregrin Took, you are the worst.
2090045 2091714 Hurry! Hurry!
2093215 2094633 Where are we going?
2094800 2096051 Why did you look?
2096218 2098971 Why do you always have to look?
2099138 2102224 -I don't know. I can't help it.<br />-You never can.
2102683 2104101 I'm sorry, all right?
2106186 2109106 -I won't do it again.<br />-Don't you understand?
2109857 2111817 The enemy thinks you have the Ring.
2111984 2115738 He's going to be looking for you, Pip.<br />They have to get you out of here.
2117156 2119825 And you--? You're coming with me?
2122036 2123454 Merry?
2123621 2124913 Come on.
2130419 2131795 How far is Minas Tirith?
2131962 2134590 Three days' ride, as the Nazgûl flies.
2134757 2138260 And you better hope we don't have<br />one of those on our tail.
2138969 2140471 Here.
2140638 2142431 Something for the road.
2143307 2145267 The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
2145434 2149438 I know you've run out.<br />You smoke too much, Pippin.
2149605 2152107 But-- But we'll see each other soon.
2155444 2157946 -Won't we?<br />-I don't know.
2159823 2161992 [TEARFULLY]<br />I don't know what's going to happen.
2162159 2163869 -Merry.<br />-Run, Shadowfax.
2164036 2165496 Show us the meaning of haste.
2165663 2167581 Merry!
2178050 2179176 Merry!
2189645 2191146 He's always followed me...
2191814 2193857 ...everywhere I went...
2194191 2195984 ...since before we were tweens.
2197152 2201073 I would get him into<br />the worst sort of trouble...
2201240 2203325 ...but I was always there to get him out.
2205786 2207663 Now he's gone.
2209331 2212251 Just like Frodo and Sam.
2212876 2215629 One thing I have learned about Hobbits:
2215796 2217464 They're a most hardy folk.
2218006 2221719 Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.

2359606 2361400 What did you see?
2362025 2365362 I looked into your future,<br />and I saw death.
2365904 2368031 But there is also life.
2369950 2373996 You saw there was a child.<br />You saw my son.

2381920 2384131 Nothing is certain.
2385841 2388552 Some things are certain.
2392347 2395183 If I leave him now...
2395350 2397978 ...I will regret it forever.

2591296 2593090 Make way!

2628542 2630377 The tree of the king.
2630544 2633213 Lord Denethor, however,<br />is not king.
2633380 2636049 He is a steward only,<br />a caretaker of the throne.
2636800 2640345 Now listen carefully.<br />Lord Denethor is Boromir's father.
2640887 2644683 To give him news of his beloved son's<br />death would be most unwise.
2645142 2648603 And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.
2649479 2652232 And say nothing of Aragorn either.
2654067 2657946 In fact, it's better if you<br />don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.

2700113 2704826 I come with tidings in this dark hour,<br />and with counsel.
2705785 2709164 Perhaps you come to explain this.
2714794 2719341 Perhaps you come to tell me<br />why my son is dead.

2731895 2733647 [ARROW IMPACTS]<br />[GRUNTS]
2733813 2736816 Boromir died to save us...
2736983 2738652 ...my kinsman and me.
2738818 2742322 -He fell defending us from many foes.<br />-Pippin.
2747827 2751289 I offer you my service, such as it is...
2751831 2753833 ...in payment of this debt.
2756002 2759339 This is my first command to you.
2760048 2763510 How did you escape<br />and my son did not...
2763843 2766179 ...so mighty a man as he was?
2766846 2770183 The mightiest man<br />may be slain by one arrow...
2770433 2772352 ...and Boromir was pierced by many.
2776481 2778191 Get up.
2778358 2782988 My lord, there will be a time<br />to grieve for Boromir...
2783446 2785198 ...but it is not now.
2785907 2788118 War is coming.
2788451 2792872 The enemy is on your doorstep.<br />As steward, you are charged...
2793039 2797210 ...with the defense of this city.<br />Where are Gondor's armies?
2797377 2802257 You still have friends.<br />You are not alone in this fight.
2802424 2806928 Send word to Théoden of Rohan.<br />Light the beacons.
2808513 2812058 You think you are wise, Mithrandir.
2812225 2815270 Yet for all your subtleties,<br />you have not wisdom.
2817397 2821568 Do you think the eyes<br />of the White Tower are blind?
2821735 2824821 I have seen more than you know.
2824988 2828199 With your left hand you would use me<br />as a shield against Mordor.
2828366 2831244 And with your right<br />you'd seek to supplant me.
2831411 2835123 I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.
2835290 2841254 Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears<br />of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
2841421 2846259 And I tell you now, I will not bow<br />to this Ranger from the North...
2846426 2850930 ...last of a ragged house<br />long bereft of lordship.
2851097 2856936 Authority is not given to you<br />to deny the return of the king, steward.
2857103 2861524 The rule of Gondor is mine<br />and no other's.
2866696 2868490 GANDALF:<br />Come.
2876414 2879000 All has turned to vain ambition.
2879167 2882629 He would even use his grief<br />as a cloak.
2885507 2888301 A thousand years<br />this city has stood.
2889386 2891805 Now, at the whim of a madman,<br />it will fall.
2893014 2895225 And the White Tree,<br />the tree of the king...
2895392 2896935 ...will never bloom again.
2897102 2898812 PIPPIN:<br />Why are they still guarding it?
2898978 2901022 GANDALF:<br />They guard it because they have hope.
2901189 2903817 A faint and fading hope<br />that one day it will flower.
2903983 2908738 That a king will come<br />and this city will be as it once was...
2908905 2911825 ...before it fell into decay.
2911991 2915245 The old wisdom borne out<br />of the West was forsaken.
2915412 2919707 Kings made tombs more splendid<br />than the houses of the living...
2919916 2921835 ...and counted the old names<br />of their descent...
2922001 2924796 ...dearer than the names of their sons.
2924963 2930009 Childless lords sat in aged halls,<br />musing on heraldry...
2930176 2935515 ...or in high, cold towers,<br />asking questions of the stars.
2935682 2939477 And so the people of Gondor<br />fell into ruin.
2940437 2942772 The line of kings failed.
2943481 2945859 The White Tree withered.
2946568 2950738 The rule of Gondor was given over<br />to lesser men.
2961458 2962709 Mordor.
2963209 2966880 Yes, there it lies.
2967714 2971050 This city has dwelt ever<br />in the sight of its shadow.
2971259 2972886 [THUNDER ROLLING]
2973052 2974721 A storm is coming.
2975388 2978308 This is not the weather of the world.
2978475 2980685 This is a device of Sauron's making.
2980852 2984606 A broil of fume<br />he sends ahead of his host.
2985190 2987650 The Orcs of Mordor<br />have no love of daylight...
2987817 2989652 ...so he covers the face of the sun...
2989819 2993573 ...to ease their passage<br />along the road to war.
2993740 2997035 When the Shadow of Mordor<br />reaches this city...
2997744 2999454 ...it will begin.
3001122 3002707 Well...
3003082 3004417 ...Minas Tirith...
3006336 3007712 ...very impressive.
3007879 3010548 -So where are we off to next?<br />-Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.
3010715 3012926 There's no leaving this city.
3015261 3018389 Help must come to us.
3019974 3022644 SAM:<br />It must be getting near teatime.
3022810 3026523 Leastways, it would be in decent places<br />where there is still teatime.
3026689 3030276 We're not in decent places.
3035823 3037075 Mr. Frodo?
3040119 3041329 What is it?
3043790 3046167 It's just a feeling.
3048586 3050755 I don't think I'll be coming back.
3055260 3057804 Yes, you will. Of course you will.
3058429 3060306 That's just morbid thinking.
3060765 3063226 We're going there and back again...
3063393 3065687 ...just like Mr. Bilbo.
3066646 3068773 You'll see.
3076948 3080577 FRODO: I think these lands<br />were once part of the kingdom of Gondor.
3084956 3089002 Long ago, when there was a king.
3109647 3112483 Mr. Frodo, look.
3114110 3116863 The king has got a crown again.
3127999 3132253 Come on, Hobbits!<br />Mustn't stop now. This way.

3143806 3145975 [COUGHING]
3149103 3153149 So I imagine this is just<br />a ceremonial position.
3153316 3157570 I mean, they don't actually expect me<br />to do any fighting.
3158404 3161658 -Do they?<br />-You're in the service of the steward now.
3161824 3165203 You'll have to do as you're told,<br />Peregrin Took.
3169248 3171751 Ridiculous Hobbit.

3184639 3186474 Thank you.
3195858 3198111 There's no more stars.
3198611 3199821 Is it time?
3200988 3202740 Yes.
3205368 3207036 It's so quiet.
3208037 3212291 It's the deep breath before the plunge.
3213459 3216337 I don't want to be in a battle...
3217171 3222135 ...but waiting on the edge of one<br />I can't escape is even worse.
3225680 3229308 Is there any hope, Gandalf,<br />for Frodo and Sam?
3230643 3233771 GANDALF:<br />There never was much hope.
3235732 3237483 Just a fool's hope.
3243364 3246159 Our enemy is ready.
3246325 3248995 His full strength's gathered.

3261674 3263217 MAN:<br />Come on.
3264343 3267680 This will be the end of Gondor<br />as we know it.
3267847 3271225 Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.
3272185 3276522 If the river is taken,<br />if the garrison at Osgiliath falls...
3276689 3280359 ...the last defense of this city<br />will be gone.
3280526 3284572 But we have the White Wizard.<br />That's got to count for something.
3290453 3292038 Gandalf?
3295750 3299420 GANDALF: <i>Sauron has yet to reveal<br />his deadliest servant...</i>
3299879 3303716 <i>...the one who will lead<br />Mordor's armies in war.</i>
3303883 3309055 <i>The one they say no living man can kill.</i>
3310056 3312225 The Witch-king of Angmar.
3313309 3315686 You've met him before.
3316354 3318940 He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.

6435637 6437180 ...to come to his aid...
6437347 6439098 ...to fight.

11880763 11884517 Is there any in this rout<br />with authority to treat with me?
11884892 11888020 We do not come to treat with Sauron...

12061902 12065322 ...when we forsake our friends<br />and break all bonds of fellowship.

12227609 12229862 It'll be spring soon.
12230612 12233365 And the orchards will be in blossom.
12233449 12237161 And the birds will be nesting<br />in the hazel thicket.
12238579 12242583 And they'll be sowing<br />the summer barley in the lower fields...
12243625 12247963 ...and eating the first<br />of the strawberries with cream.

14549220 14553266 <i>Lay down</i>
14554893 14559272 <i>Your sweet and weary head</i>
14560982 14564611 <i>Night is falling</i>
14565278 14570116 <i>You have come<br />To journey's end</i>
14570784 14574579 <i>Sleep now</i>
14574663 14580335 <i>And dream<br />Of the ones who came before</i>
14582128 14586091 <i>They are calling</i>
14586174 14590303 <i>From across<br />The distant shore</i>
14591930 14596851 <i>Why do you weep?</i>
14596935 14602023 <i>What are these tears<br />Upon your face?</i>
14602107 14607237 <i>Soon you will see</i>
14607320 14612367 <i>All of your fears<br />Will pass away</i>
14612450 14617664 <i>Safe in my arms</i>
14617747 14622335 <i>You're only sleeping</i>
14622419 14627507 <i>What can you see</i>
14627590 14632887 <i>On the horizon?</i>
14632971 14637559 <i>Why do the white gulls</i>
14637642 14642397 <i>Call?</i>
14643565 14648236 <i>Across the sea</i>
14648319 14653700 <i>A pale moon rises</i>
14653783 14656578 <i>The ships have come</i>
14656661 14662500 <i>To carry you home</i>
14664711 14669299 <i>And all will turn</i>
14669382 14674804 <i>To silver glass</i>
14674888 14679267 <i>A light on the water</i>
14679350 14684939 <i>All souls pass</i>
14685023 14689235 <i>Hope fades</i>
14690820 14695742 <i>Into the world of night</i>
14696409 14700246 <i>Through shadows falling</i>
14701080 14706252 <i>Out of memory and time</i>
14706920 14710632 <i>Don't say</i>
14711424 14716429 <i>We have come now to the end</i>
14717263 14721768 <i>White shores are calling</i>
14721851 14725480 <i>You and I will meet again</i>
14725563 14732070 <i>And you'll be here<br />In my arms</i>
14733279 14737367 <i>Just sleeping</i>
14737450 14742372 <i>What can you see</i>
14742455 14747502 <i>On the horizon?</i>
14747585 14752507 <i>Why do the white gulls</i>
14752590 14758054 <i>Call?</i>
14758137 14763351 <i>Across the sea</i>
14763434 14768523 <i>A pale moon rises</i>
