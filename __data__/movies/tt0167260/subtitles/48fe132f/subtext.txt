77500 79124 Smeagol!
79293 81535 I've got one!
82171 84164 I've got a fish, Smeag. Smeagol!
84340 87459 Pull it in. Go on. Go on. Go on. Pull it in.
95684 97511 Deagol!
154908 156735 Deagol?
159288 161529 Deagol.
177347 179423 Give us that, Deagol, my love.
184395 185676 Why?
186772 189014 Because...
189191 192940 it's my birthday and I wants it.
286995 292238 My precious.
299799 302716 They cursed us.
302885 304260 Murderer.
304429 306884 "Murderer" they called us.
307056 311847 They cursed us and drove us away.
312978 314686 Gollum.
314854 316563 Gollum.
316732 318688 Gollum.
322237 325238 And we wept, precious.
325406 328989 We wept to be so alone.
331579 335363 - and cool<br />- So nice for feet
336376 340753 And we only wish To catch a fish
340922 344172 So juicy sweet
349931 354058 And we forgot the taste of bread...
354226 357844 the sound of trees...
358730 361934 the softness of the wind.
362567 368238 We even forgot our own name.
376373 382790 My precious.
427047 429288 Wake up!
430342 432002 Wake up!
432177 433969 Wake up, sleepies.
434137 436010 We must go, yes.
436181 438850 We must go at once.
442395 445479 Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?
447692 450230 I've gone and had too much.
451612 453355 Must be getting late.
453530 455025 No.
455199 457108 It isn't.
457284 460320 It isn't midday yet.
460496 463069 The days are growing darker.
467336 469543 Come on!
471966 474207 Must go! No time!
474384 476756 Not before Mr. Frodo's had something to eat.
476928 479799 No time to lose, silly.
488565 489845 Here.
493070 494896 What about you?
495071 498440 Oh, no, I'm not hungry.<br />Leastways, not for lembas bread.
499034 500408 Sam.
502996 504538 All right.
504705 507196 We don't have that much left.
507375 510245 We have to be careful or we're going to run out.
512421 515339 You go ahead and eat that, Mr. Frodo.
515507 516918 I've rationed it.
517426 519086 There should be enough.
521263 522461 For what?
524141 525884 The journey home.
533733 536058 Come, Hobbitses.
537445 539319 Very close now.
539489 542739 Very close to Mordor.
542909 545578 No safe places here.
545745 547903 Hurry.
600298 602006 It's good.
602926 604669 Definitely from the Shire.
606888 609011 Longbottom Leaf.
614354 618683 I feel like I'm back at The Green Dragon.
619775 623025 - Green Dragon.<br />- A mug of ale in my hand.
623195 627774 Putting my feet up on a settle after a hard day's work.
628367 631818 Only, you've never done a hard day's work.
644633 647669 Welcome, my lords...
647844 650086 to Isengard!
650472 654220 You young rascals! A merry hunt you've led us on...
654392 659386 and now we find you feasting and... and smoking!
659564 662731 We are sitting on a field of victory...
662900 666400 enjoying a few well-earned comforts.
667488 671320 The salted pork is particularly good.
671868 674240 Salted pork?
675454 678870 - Hobbits.<br />- We're under orders from Treebeard...
679041 681876 who's taken over management of Isengard.
684421 687422 Young Master Gandalf.
687591 692170 I'm glad you've come.
692346 696758 Wood and water, stock and stone I can master.
696933 700599 But there is a wizard to manage here...
700770 702763 locked in his tower.
705441 706770 Show yourself.
707026 708734 Be careful.
709528 712198 Even in defeat, Saruman is dangerous.
712365 714488 Well, let's just have his head and be done with it.
714659 716698 No.
717036 719361 We need him alive.
720373 722946 We need him to talk.
724836 729046 You have fought many wars and<br />slain many men, Theoden King...
729214 730708 and made peace afterwards.
730883 735841 Can we not take counsel together<br />as we once did, my old friend?
736012 739216 Can we not have peace, you and I?
739391 741300 We shall have peace.
743228 745351 We shall have peace...
745522 749566 when you answer for the burning of the Westfold...
749735 752486 and the children that lie dead there!
753238 757402 We shall have peace when the lives of the soldiers...
757575 759652 whose bodies were hewn even as they lay dead...
759828 763363 against the gates of the Hornburg, are avenged!
764916 770503 When you hang from a gibbet for<br />the sport of your own crows...
771422 773664 we shall have peace.
776427 779131 Gibbets and crows?
779472 780716 Dotard!
782182 785017 What do you want, Gandalf Greyhame?
786019 788511 Let me guess. The Key of Orthanc.
788689 791606 Or perhaps the Keys of Barad-dur itself...
791775 795772 along with the crowns of the seven<br />kings and the rods of the Five Wizards!
795946 798899 Your treachery has already cost many lives.
799074 801446 Thousands more are now at risk.
801618 803990 But you could save them, Saruman.
804162 806450 You were deep in the enemy's counsel.
806623 809908 So you have come here for information.
810793 812621 I have some for you.
818092 821046 Something festers in the heart of Middle-earth.
821220 823462 Something that you have failed to see.
825975 829474 But the Great Eye has seen it.
830521 834221 Even now he presses his advantage.
835984 839318 His attack will come soon.
841532 843655 You're all going to die.
846161 849411 But you know this, don't you, Gandalf?
849581 854207 You cannot think that this Ranger will<br />ever sit upon the throne of Gondor.
854378 860463 This exile, crept from the<br />shadows, will never be crowned king.
861802 865466 Gandalf does not hesitate to<br />sacrifice those closest to him...
866389 868595 those he professes to love.
869642 874185 Tell me, what words of comfort<br />did you give the Halfling...
874355 877391 before you sent him to his doom?
879818 884528 The path that you have set<br />him on can only lead to death.
884865 887024 I've heard enough!
887201 889027 Shoot him. Stick an arrow in his gob.
889536 891196 No.
891664 893870 Come down, Saruman...
894041 897990 - and your life will be spared.<br />- Save your pity and your mercy.
898170 899498 I have no use for it!
908721 910180 Saruman...
911224 914391 your staff is broken.
925279 928731 Grima, you need not follow him.
929908 932578 You were not always as you are now.
932745 935580 You were once a Man of Rohan.
935748 936993 Come down.
937166 939871 A Man of Rohan?
940795 943036 What is the house of Rohan...
943213 946879 but a thatched barn where brigands drink in the reek...
947050 950751 and their brats roll on the floor with the dogs?
951263 957716 The victory at Helm's Deep does not<br />belong to you, Theoden Horse-master.
958353 962931 You are a lesser son of greater sires.
965276 966984 Grima...
967821 969694 come down.
970031 971442 Be free of him.
971617 975614 - Free? He will never be free.<br />- No.
975995 978617 Get down, cur!
980374 981655 Saruman!
981834 984455 You were deep in the enemy's counsel.
984962 987121 Tell us what you know!
988633 993875 You withdraw your guard, and I will<br />tell you where your doom will be decided.
994054 997589 I will not be held prisoner here.
1024709 1026252 Send word to all our allies...
1026419 1029337 and to every corner of<br />Middle-earth that still stands free.
1029880 1033001 The enemy moves against us. We<br />need to know where he will strike.
1052194 1056144 The filth of Saruman...
1056323 1060154 is washing away.
1060327 1064870 Trees will come back to live here.
1065373 1067532 Young trees.
1067709 1069915 - Wild trees.<br />- Pippin!
1079387 1081546 Bless my bark!
1081723 1083596 Peregrin Took!
1083767 1086388 I'll take that, my lad.
1086560 1088435 Quickly, now.
1138611 1144197 Tonight we remember those who gave<br />their blood to defend this country.
1144867 1146907 Hail the victorious dead.
1147077 1148488 Hail!
1159465 1161374 No pauses.
1161550 1165714 - No spills.<br />- And no regurgitation.
1166221 1167881 So it's a drinking game?
1169433 1172137 Last one standing wins.
1176481 1178474 What'll we drink to? Let's drink to victory!
1178650 1180061 To victory!
1192660 1194530 Westu, Aragorn, hál.<br />(Be thou, Aragorn, well.)
1224027 1225687 I am happy for you.
1226070 1228479 He is an honorable man.
1228907 1231362 You are both honorable men.
1233203 1238541 It was not Theoden of Rohan<br />who led our people to victory.
1246716 1248542 Don't listen to me.
1249385 1250879 You are young.
1251053 1253379 And tonight is for you.
1267736 1269396 Here, here.
1270906 1276825 It's the Dwarves that go<br />swimming with little, hairy women.
1282209 1283453 I feel something.
1285587 1288077 A slight tingle in my fingers.
1288798 1290375 I think it's affecting me.
1292302 1294009 What did I say?
1294178 1297512 He can't hold his liquor.
1304855 1306184 Game over.
1306356 1309773 Oh, you can search far and wide<br />You can drink the whole town dry
1309943 1313893 But you'll never find a beer so brown<br />But you'll never find a beer so brown
1314073 1318449 As the one we drink in our hometown<br />As the one we drink in our hometown
1318619 1322533 You can drink your fancy ales<br />You can drink them by the flagon
1322706 1325872 But the only brew for the brave and true
1328504 1329783 Pippin!
1330255 1333291 But the only brew for the brave and true
1333633 1336338 Comes from The Green Dragon
1339056 1341890 Thank you! I win!
1343643 1346134 No news of Frodo?
1346312 1349812 No word. Nothing.
1350650 1352808 We have time.
1354320 1357605 Every day, Frodo moves closer to Mordor.
1358365 1360442 Do we know that?
1364288 1365996 What does your heart tell you?
1373047 1376380 That Frodo is alive.
1378552 1380343 Yes.
1382931 1385089 Yes, he's alive.
1387352 1390187 Too risky. Too risky.
1390355 1391600 Thieves.
1391773 1393812 They stole it from us.
1393983 1397483 Kill them. Kill them. Kill them both.
1399530 1402365 Quiet! Mustn't wake them.
1402533 1405071 Mustn't ruin it now.
1405244 1407321 But they knows.
1407497 1409370 They knows.
1409540 1412161 They suspects us.
1413377 1416911 What's it saying, my precious, my love?
1417089 1420671 Is Smeagol losing his nerve?
1421343 1423715 No. Not.
1423888 1428134 Never. Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.
1428308 1433136 Smeagol wants to see them dead.
1433313 1435851 And we will.
1436024 1440069 Smeagol did it once. He can do it again.
1443406 1446076 It's ours!
1446242 1448912 Ours!
1450038 1452908 We must get the precious. We must get it back.
1453082 1456498 Patience! Patience, my love.
1456669 1461047 First we must lead them to her.
1461924 1466918 We lead them to the Winding Stair.
1467096 1469765 Yes, the stairs. And then?
1469932 1472932 Up, up, up, up, up the stairs we go...
1473102 1479519 until we come to the tunnel.
1479900 1483020 And when they go in...
1483195 1485982 there's no coming out.
1486907 1489778 She's always hungry.
1490536 1494746 She always needs to feed.
1494914 1496325 She must eat.
1496500 1498622 All she gets is filthy Orcses.
1498794 1501545 And they doesn't taste very nice, does they, precious?
1502172 1503796 No.
1503965 1508674 Not very nice at all, my love.
1508845 1511632 She hungers for sweeter meats.
1511806 1513633 Hobbit meat.
1513807 1518636 And when she throws away the<br />bones and the empty clothes...
1518813 1521897 then we will find it.
1522066 1526394 And take it for me!
1528155 1529566 For us.
1530074 1533075 Yes. We meant "for us."
1533243 1536695 Gollum. Gollum.
1536872 1541368 The precious will be ours...
1541542 1546039 once the Hobbitses are dead!
1546548 1548007 You treacherous little toad!
1550718 1553007 No! No! Master!
1553179 1554804 No, Sam! Leave him alone!
1555682 1558351 I heard it from his own mouth. He means to murder us.
1558517 1562681 Never! Smeagol wouldn't hurt a fly.
1564190 1566763 He's a horrid, fat Hobbit...
1566943 1568521 who hates Smeagol...
1568694 1571482 and who makes up nasty lies.
1571656 1574324 You miserable little maggot! I'll stove your head in!
1574700 1575980 Sam!
1576368 1578657 Call me a liar? You're a liar!
1579621 1583535 - You scare him off, we're lost!<br />- I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.
1583709 1586876 - I won't wait around for him to kill us!<br />- I'm not sending him away.
1587212 1588541 You don't see it, do you?
1588964 1590374 He's a villain.
1591383 1595001 We can't do this by ourselves,<br />Sam. Not without a guide.
1595846 1598716 I need you on my side.
1599516 1601841 I'm on your side, Mr. Frodo.
1603353 1606307 I know, Sam. I know.
1606856 1608849 Trust me.
1609025 1611397 Come, Smeagol.
1679343 1680802 What time is it?
1683139 1684633 Not yet dawn.
1691563 1694599 I dreamed I saw a great wave...
1694774 1698773 climbing over green lands and above the hills.
1700030 1702485 I stood upon the brink.
1703408 1706575 It was utterly dark in the abyss before my feet.
1708496 1711283 A light shone behind me...
1711916 1714324 but I could not turn.
1714502 1717918 I could only stand there, waiting.
1719382 1722086 Night changes many thoughts.
1722468 1724627 Sleep, Eowyn.
1725179 1727421 Sleep...
1730142 1732016 while you can.
1756167 1758456 The stars are veiled.
1759463 1762961 Something stirs in the east.
1763633 1766752 A sleepless malice.
1768763 1771550 The Eye of the enemy is moving.
1784987 1787692 What are you doing?
1792327 1793786 Pippin!
1801295 1803038 Pippin?
1815933 1817262 Pippin.
1817936 1820605 - What, are you mad?<br />- I just want to look at it.
1820772 1821886 Just one more time.
1822148 1824224 Put it back.
1834494 1836285 Pippin.
1842793 1844288 No!
1849382 1850628 Pippin.
1853971 1855169 He is here.
1855347 1857635 I see you.
1860643 1862268 Pippin!
1876910 1879661 Help! Gandalf, help!
1881414 1883287 Someone help him!
1889672 1890870 Pippin!
1892008 1893252 Fool of a Took!
1914362 1916569 Look at me.
1918533 1922661 Gandalf, forgive me.
1922829 1924703 Look at me.
1924872 1926700 What did you see?
1930211 1932287 A tree.
1933256 1935130 There was a white tree...
1935300 1936794 in a courtyard of stone.
1939596 1940875 It was dead.
1945059 1946885 The city was burning.
1947060 1950430 Minas Tirith? Is that what you saw?
1951107 1953145 I saw...
1956528 1957904 I saw him.
1960908 1963150 I could hear his voice in my head.
1963327 1965734 And what did you tell him?
1965912 1967739 Speak!
1971918 1975084 He asked me my name. I didn't answer.
1975255 1976714 He hurt me.
1976882 1979337 What did you tell him about Frodo and the Ring?
1982846 1985301 There was no lie in Pippin's eyes.
1986140 1988382 A fool...
1988559 1990848 but an honest fool he remains.
1991312 1994847 He told Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
1995900 1998272 We've been strangely fortunate.
1998444 2002311 Pippin saw in the palantir a<br />glimpse of the enemy's plan.
2003241 2007190 Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas Tirith.
2007787 2011535 His defeat at Helm's Deep showed our enemy one thing.
2011707 2014032 He knows the heir of Elendil has come forth.
2014209 2016332 Men are not as weak as he supposed.
2016503 2020287 There is courage still, strength<br />enough perhaps to challenge him.
2020507 2022381 Sauron fears this.
2022550 2026880 He will not risk the peoples of<br />Middle-earth uniting under one banner.
2028056 2030464 He will raze Minas Tirith to the ground...
2030642 2034141 before he sees a king return to the throne of Men.
2034312 2038226 If the beacons of Gondor are<br />lit, Rohan must be ready for war.
2039150 2041356 Tell me...
2041527 2045311 why should we ride to the aid of<br />those who did not come to ours?
2049201 2051028 What do we owe Gondor?
2052162 2054202 - I will go.<br />- No!
2054373 2057539 - They must be warned.<br />- They will be.
2060963 2063501 You must come to Minas Tirith by another road.
2064049 2068510 Follow the river. Look to the black ships.
2069471 2071429 Understand this:
2071598 2075263 Things are now in motion that cannot be undone.
2076770 2078845 I ride for Minas Tirith...
2081107 2083777 and I won't be going alone.
2085528 2089193 Of all the inquisitive Hobbits,<br />Peregrin Took, you are the worst.
2090199 2091860 Hurry! Hurry!
2093370 2094779 Where are we going?
2094954 2096199 Why did you look?
2096373 2099123 Why do you always have to look?
2099291 2102375 - I don't know. I can't help it.<br />- You never can.
2102837 2104247 I'm sorry, all right?
2106340 2109258 - I won't do it again.<br />- Don't you understand?
2110011 2111967 The enemy thinks you have the Ring.
2112137 2115885 He's going to be looking for you,<br />Pip. They have to get you out of here.
2117309 2119979 And you...? You're coming with me?
2122189 2123599 Merry?
2123774 2125054 Come on.
2130572 2131948 How far is Minas Tirith?
2132115 2134736 Three days' ride, as the Nazgul flies.
2134909 2138409 And you better hope we don't<br />have one of those on our tail.
2139122 2140616 Here.
2140790 2142582 Something for the road.
2143460 2145416 The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
2145587 2149584 I know you've run out. You smoke too much, Pippin.
2149757 2152248 But... But we'll see each other soon.
2155596 2158087 - Won't we?<br />- I don't know.
2160101 2162140 I don't know what's going to happen.
2162311 2164019 - Merry.<br />- Run, Shadowfax.
2164188 2165646 Show us the meaning of haste.
2165814 2167724 Merry!
2178202 2179316 Merry!
2189796 2191290 He's always followed me...
2191965 2194004 everywhere I went...
2194342 2196133 since before we were tweens.
2197303 2201217 I would get him into the worst sort of trouble...
2201390 2203466 but I was always there to get him out.
2205936 2207811 Now he's gone.
2209482 2212399 Just like Frodo and Sam.
2213027 2215778 One thing I have learned about Hobbits:
2215946 2217607 They're a most hardy folk.
2218156 2221857 Foolhardy, maybe. He's a Took.
2236341 2238629 Take her by the safest road.
2238802 2241293 A ship lies anchored in the Grey Havens.
2241471 2245338 It waits to carry her across the sea.
2245516 2248886 The last journey of Arwen Undomiel.
2314500 2317585 There is nothing for you here...
2318087 2320293 only death.
2327596 2328877 Lady Arwen...
2329807 2331715 we cannot delay.
2334186 2335430 My lady!
2354831 2357452 - Tell me what you have seen.<br />- Arwen.
2357625 2359582 You have the gift of foresight.
2359752 2361544 What did you see?
2362171 2365505 I looked into your future, and I saw death.
2366050 2368172 But there is also life.
2370096 2374140 You saw there was a child. You saw my son.
2374767 2377304 That future is almost gone.
2377478 2379470 But it is not lost.
2382066 2384272 Nothing is certain.
2385986 2388691 Some things are certain.
2392493 2395327 If I leave him now...
2395495 2398116 I will regret it forever.
2399207 2401532 It is time.
2406797 2410581 From the ashes a fire shall be woken
2410760 2414176 A light from the shadow shall spring
2414346 2417632 Renewed shall be blade that was broken
2425023 2428227 The crownless again shall be king
2431989 2434028 Re-forge the sword.
2435700 2436380 Ada.<br />(Father.)
2468899 2471604 Your hands are cold.
2474988 2478109 The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
2481537 2483446 This was my choice.
2485290 2487579 Whether by your will or not...
2488919 2493213 there is no ship now that can bear me hence.
2540427 2543263 We've just passed into the realm of Gondor.
2554900 2557141 Minas Tirith.
2557736 2560061 City of kings.
2591435 2593227 Make way!
2622423 2624251 It's the tree.
2624425 2626085 Gandalf. Gandalf.
2626260 2628502 Yes, the White Tree of Gondor.
2628679 2630506 The tree of the king.
2630681 2633351 Lord Denethor, however, is not king.
2633518 2636186 He is a steward only, a caretaker of the throne.
2636937 2640472 Now listen carefully. Lord<br />Denethor is Boromir's father.
2641025 2644809 To give him news of his beloved<br />son's death would be most unwise.
2645278 2648730 And do not mention Frodo or the Ring.
2649616 2652368 And say nothing of Aragorn either.
2654204 2658071 In fact, it's better if you<br />don't speak at all, Peregrin Took.
2688238 2694738 Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,<br />lord and steward of Gondor.
2700249 2704957 I come with tidings in this<br />dark hour, and with counsel.
2705920 2709290 Perhaps you come to explain this.
2714929 2719472 Perhaps you come to tell me why my son is dead.
2733948 2736948 Boromir died to save us...
2737118 2738778 my kinsman and me.
2738953 2742452 - He fell defending us from many foes.<br />- Pippin.
2747962 2751412 I offer you my service, such as it is...
2751965 2753958 in payment of this debt.
2756136 2759469 This is my first command to you.
2760182 2763633 How did you escape and my son did not...
2763976 2766302 so mighty a man as he was?
2766980 2770313 The mightiest man may be slain by one arrow...
2770567 2772476 and Boromir was pierced by many.
2776615 2778322 Get up.
2778491 2783117 My lord, there will be a time to grieve for Boromir...
2783579 2785322 but it is not now.
2786040 2788246 War is coming.
2788584 2792996 The enemy is on your doorstep.<br />As steward, you are charged...
2793172 2797335 with the defense of this city.<br />Where are Gondor's armies?
2797509 2802385 You still have friends. You<br />are not alone in this fight.
2802556 2807052 Send word to Theoden of Rohan. Light the beacons.
2808645 2812180 You think you are wise, Mithrandir.
2812357 2815394 Yet for all your subtleties, you have not wisdom.
2817529 2821692 Do you think the eyes of the White Tower are blind?
2821866 2824951 I have seen more than you know.
2825120 2828323 With your left hand you would<br />use me as a shield against Mordor.
2828498 2831368 And with your right you'd seek to supplant me.
2831542 2835243 I know who rides with Theoden of Rohan.
2835421 2841376 Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears<br />of this Aragorn, son of Arathorn.
2841552 2846380 And I tell you now, I will not bow<br />to this Ranger from the North...
2846557 2851053 last of a ragged house long bereft of lordship.
2851228 2857064 Authority is not given to you to<br />deny the return of the king, steward.
2857234 2861647 The rule of Gondor is mine and no other's.
2866827 2868618 Come.
2876545 2879118 All has turned to vain ambition.
2879297 2882748 He would even use his grief as a cloak.
2885637 2888423 A thousand years this city has stood.
2889516 2891923 Now, at the whim of a madman, it will fall.
2893144 2895350 And the White Tree, the tree of the king...
2895521 2897064 will never bloom again.
2897231 2900600 - Why are they still guarding it?<br />- They guard it because they have hope.
2900777 2903943 A faint and fading hope that one day it will flower.
2904113 2908858 That a king will come and this<br />city will be as it once was...
2909035 2911951 before it fell into decay.
2912121 2915371 The old wisdom borne out of the West was forsaken.
2915540 2919834 Kings made tombs more splendid<br />than the houses of the living...
2920045 2921954 and counted the old names of their descent...
2922130 2924917 dearer than the names of their sons.
2925092 2930132 Childless lords sat in aged<br />halls, musing on heraldry...
2930305 2935644 or in high, cold towers, asking questions of the stars.
2935810 2939594 And so the people of Gondor fell into ruin.
2940565 2942890 The line of kings failed.
2943609 2945981 The White Tree withered.
2946695 2950859 The rule of Gondor was given over to lesser men.
2961585 2962830 Mordor.
2963337 2967002 Yes, there it lies.
2967841 2971175 This city has dwelt ever in the sight of its shadow.
2973179 2974839 A storm is coming.
2975515 2978433 This is not the weather of the world.
2978601 2980808 This is a device of Sauron's making.
2980979 2984727 A broil of fume he sends ahead of his host.
2985316 2987771 The Orcs of Mordor have no love of daylight...
2987944 2989771 so he covers the face of the sun...
2989946 2993694 to ease their passage along the road to war.
2993867 2997152 When the Shadow of Mordor reaches this city...
2997870 2999578 it will begin.
3001248 3002826 Well...
3003209 3004537 Minas Tirith...
3006462 3007873 very impressive.
3008046 3010668 - So where are we off to next?<br />- Oh, it's too late for that, Peregrin.
3010841 3013048 There's no leaving this city.
3015387 3018590 Help must come to us.
3020100 3022770 It must be getting near teatime.
3022936 3026637 Leastways, it would be in decent<br />places where there is still teatime.
3026815 3030398 We're not in decent places.
3035949 3037194 Mr. Frodo?
3040245 3041442 What is it?
3043915 3046287 It's just a feeling.
3048711 3050870 I don't think I'll be coming back.
3055385 3057922 Yes, you will. Of course you will.
3058554 3060427 That's just morbid thinking.
3060890 3063345 We're going there and back again...
3063517 3065806 just like Mr. Bilbo.
3066771 3068894 You'll see.
3077072 3080690 I think these lands were once<br />part of the kingdom of Gondor.
3085080 3089124 Long ago, when there was a king.
3109771 3112605 Mr. Frodo, look.
3114232 3116984 The king has got a crown again.
3128122 3132368 Come on, Hobbits! Mustn't stop now. This way.
3149225 3153270 So I imagine this is just a ceremonial position.
3153437 3157685 I mean, they don't actually<br />expect me to do any fighting.
3158526 3161776 - Do they?<br />- You're in the service of the steward now.
3161945 3165315 You'll have to do as you're told, Peregrin Took.
3169369 3171861 Ridiculous Hobbit.
3173040 3175246 Guard of the Citadel.
3184760 3186586 Thank you.
3195978 3198220 There's no more stars.
3198731 3199930 Is it time?
3201109 3202852 Yes.
3205488 3207148 It's so quiet.
3208157 3212404 It's the deep breath before the plunge.
3213580 3216449 I don't want to be in a battle...
3217292 3222249 but waiting on the edge of one<br />I can't escape is even worse.
3225800 3229418 Is there any hope, Gandalf, for Frodo and Sam?
3230762 3233882 There never was much hope.
3235851 3237594 Just a fool's hope.
3243483 3246270 Our enemy is ready.
3246444 3249114 His full strength's gathered.
3249281 3252779 Not only Orcs, but Men as well.
3252951 3255987 Legions of Haradrim from the south...
3256162 3258866 mercenaries from the coast.
3259040 3261613 All will answer Mordor's call.
3261792 3263334 Come on.
3264462 3267795 This will be the end of Gondor as we know it.
3267965 3271334 Here the hammer stroke will fall hardest.
3272303 3276632 If the river is taken, if the<br />garrison at Osgiliath falls...
3276807 3280472 the last defense of this city will be gone.
3280644 3284689 But we have the White Wizard.<br />That's got to count for something.
3290570 3292148 Gandalf?
3295867 3299532 Sauron has yet to reveal his deadliest servant...
3299996 3303828 the one who will lead Mordor's armies in war.
3304000 3309160 The one they say no living man can kill.
3310173 3312331 The Witch King of Angmar.
3313425 3315798 You've met him before.
3316470 3319044 He stabbed Frodo on Weathertop.
3325605 3328309 He is the lord of the Nazgul...
3328774 3331230 the greatest of the Nine.
3331401 3335020 Minas Morgul is his lair.
3338492 3342026 The Dead City.
3342203 3347411 Very nasty place. Full of enemies.
3354633 3356791 Quick. Quick.
3356968 3360965 They will see. They will see.
3370230 3375521 Come away. Come away. Look, we have found it.
3375695 3379562 The way into Mordor.
3379740 3384070 The secret stair.
3384494 3386866 Climb.
3407141 3409893 - No, Mr. Frodo!<br />- Not that way!
3414732 3417603 - What's it doing?<br />- No.
3417777 3420861 - They're calling me.<br />- No.
3450517 3453471 Hide! Hide!
3497021 3499856 I can feel his blade.
3511534 3513658 We come to it at last.
3515496 3518367 The great battle of our time.
3557538 3560787 Come away, Hobbits. We climb. We must climb.
3570675 3573676 The board is set.
3573844 3576383 The pieces are moving.
3578933 3581603 Up, up, up the stairs we go.
3581769 3584438 And then it's into the tunnel.
3584605 3587809 Hey, what's in this tunnel?
3588358 3591110 You listen to me, and you listen good and proper.
3591278 3594196 Anything happens to him, you have me to answer to.
3594364 3595942 One sniff something's not right...
3596117 3599283 one hair stands up on the back of my head, it's over.
3599494 3602164 No more slinker. No more stinker.
3602497 3605119 You're gone. Got it?
3606001 3607993 I'm watching you.
3613341 3615334 What was that about?
3615510 3617917 Nothing. Just clearing something up.
3624560 3627431 Peregrin Took, my lad, there is a task now to be done.
3627605 3632183 Another opportunity for one of the<br />Shire-folk to prove their great worth.
3637031 3638609 You must not fail me.
3672857 3675941 It's been very quiet across the river.
3676110 3678435 The Orcs are lying low.
3678613 3680605 The garrison may have moved out.
3681741 3684445 We've sent scouts to Cair Andros.
3684619 3687904 If the Orcs attack from the<br />north, we'll have some warning.
3713229 3714428 Quiet.
3718526 3720484 We need 10 more.
3741799 3743341 Kill him!
3760651 3763058 They're not coming from the north.
3764488 3768817 To the river. Quick. Quick. Go. Come on.
3772287 3773864 Faster.
3787010 3789382 Draw swords.
3843940 3846513 Hold! Hold them!
3926811 3928686 What?
3941242 3942653 Amon Din
3948458 3951494 The beacon. The beacon of Amon Din is lit.
3954755 3958967 Hope is kindled.
4051349 4055727 The beacons of Minas Tirith! The beacons are lit!
4056938 4058562 Gondor calls for aid.
4069074 4071992 And Rohan will answer.
4072411 4075198 Muster the Rohirrim.
4090303 4092261 Assemble the army at Dunharrow.
4092430 4096808 As many men as can be found. You have two days.
4096976 4102267 On the third, we ride for Gondor and war.
4103232 4104561 - Forward.<br />- Very good, sir.
4104734 4106062 - Gamling.<br />- My lord.
4106235 4107813 Make haste across the Riddermark.
4107988 4110110 Summon every able-bodied man to Dunharrow.
4110281 4111859 I will.
4115953 4119120 - Will you ride with us?<br />- Just to the encampment.
4119289 4123204 It's tradition for the women of<br />the court to farewell the men.
4129758 4131668 The men have found their captain.
4131844 4135177 They will follow you into battle, even to death.
4135347 4136925 You have given us hope.
4140143 4142101 Excuse me.
4143438 4144932 I have a sword.
4145232 4146607 Please accept it.
4147734 4152230 I offer you my service, Theoden King.
4155658 4157734 And gladly I accept it.
4158828 4162908 You shall be Meriadoc, esquire of Rohan.
4167795 4168993 Horse-Men.
4169672 4175295 I wish I could muster a legion of<br />Dwarves, fully armed and filthy.
4175678 4178632 Your kinsmen may have no need to ride to war.
4178806 4182222 I fear war already marches on their own lands.
4200702 4204153 So it is before the walls of Minas Tirith...
4204331 4208198 the doom of our time will be decided.
4210795 4216335 Now is the hour. Riders of Rohan, oaths you have taken.
4216509 4220043 Now, fulfill them all. To lord and land!
4263137 4265095 Faramir!
4271395 4275096 We can't hold them. The city is lost.
4275691 4278775 Tell the men to break cover. We ride for Minas Tirith.
4287536 4289778 Nazgul.
4292166 4294621 Take cover!
4294793 4297331 Nazgul!
4297504 4301169 Fall back. Fall back to Minas Tirith!
4307764 4309638 Fall back!
4316689 4321268 - Retreat! Retreat!<br />- Run for your lives!
4345509 4349838 The age of Men is over.
4350013 4355636 The time of the Orc has come.
4358021 4360346 - Keep going.<br />- It's the Nazgul.
4361983 4364355 Take cover, my lord!
4364652 4365981 It's coming!
4371534 4374903 - It's Mithrandir.<br />- The White Rider!
4414868 4416243 Pull!
4433970 4436377 Mithrandir.
4436555 4438299 They broke through our defenses.
4438474 4440680 They've taken the bridge and the west bank.
4441769 4445932 - Battalions of Orcs are crossing the river.<br />- It is as the Lord Denethor predicted.
4446106 4450649 - Long has he foreseen this doom.<br />- Foreseen and done nothing.
4454030 4456439 Faramir?
4458368 4462200 This is not the first Halfling<br />to have crossed your path.
4462372 4464578 No.
4465917 4467459 You've seen Frodo and Sam?
4468336 4471752 - Where? When?<br />- In Ithilien.
4471923 4473999 Not two days ago.
4474467 4478927 Gandalf, they're taking the road to the Morgul Vale.
4479639 4482260 And then the pass of Cirith Ungol.
4484477 4486849 What does that mean?
4487021 4491931 - What's wrong?<br />- Faramir, tell me everything.
4492109 4494148 Tell me all you know.
4495321 4498736 This is how you would serve your city?
4498908 4502193 You would risk its utter ruin?
4503245 4504822 I did what I judged to be right.
4505538 4508539 What you judged to be right.
4509167 4515040 You sent the Ring of Power into Mordor<br />in the hands of a witless Halfling.
4519010 4523838 It should have been brought back<br />to the Citadel to be kept safe.
4525475 4527017 Hidden.
4527435 4530187 Dark and deep in the vaults...
4530354 4532513 not to be used.
4536694 4541570 Unless at the uttermost end of need.
4542033 4544072 I would not use the Ring.
4544243 4547328 Not if Minas Tirith were falling<br />in ruin and I alone could save her.
4547663 4552490 Ever you desire to appear lordly and gracious...
4552668 4554910 as a king of old.
4556713 4560462 Boromir would have remembered his father's need.
4560884 4563340 He would have brought me a kingly gift.
4563553 4566091 Boromir would not have brought the Ring.
4566515 4569634 He would have stretched out his hand to<br />this thing and taken it. He would've fallen.
4569809 4572051 - You know nothing of this matter!<br />- He would have kept it for his own.
4573939 4576097 And when he returned...
4577233 4578893 you would not have known your son.
4579068 4581606 Boromir was loyal to me!
4581779 4584352 Not some wizard's pupil!
4592498 4593826 Father?
4606512 4608421 My son.
4634664 4636039 Leave me.
4669614 4672152 Careful, master. Careful.
4672492 4675410 Very far to fall.
4677914 4681828 Very dangerous are the stairs.
4684504 4687042 Come, master.
4692846 4696012 Come to Smeagol.
4702354 4703848 Mr. Frodo.
4704857 4706399 Get back, you!
4706567 4708773 Don't touch him!
4712906 4715741 Why does he hates poor Smeagol?
4715909 4719610 What has Smeagol ever done to him?
4719788 4722160 Master?
4722957 4726409 Master carries heavy burden.
4726586 4732007 Smeagol knows. Heavy, heavy burden.
4732175 4735425 Fat one cannot know.
4737472 4740223 Smeagol look after master.
4741434 4743641 He wants it.
4743811 4748354 He needs it. Smeagol sees it in his eye.
4748524 4753980 Very soon he will ask you for it. You will see.
4754155 4758022 The fat one will take it from you.
4765248 4769578 Send forth all legions.
4769753 4773798 Do not stop the attack until the city is taken.
4774508 4777628 Slay them all.
4779304 4785093 - What of the wizard?<br />- I will break him.
4788438 4790845 Where are Theoden's riders?
4791023 4793597 Will Rohan's army come?
4793776 4796018 Mithrandir.
4797071 4800938 Courage is the best defense that you have now.
4805747 4808451 What were you thinking, Peregrin Took?
4810542 4816248 What service can a Hobbit<br />offer such a great lord of Men?
4816423 4817918 It was well-done.
4821094 4825139 A generous deed should not<br />be checked with cold counsel.
4825890 4828429 You are to join the tower guard.
4828977 4831977 I didn't think they would find<br />any livery that would fit me.
4832147 4834602 Once belonged to a young boy of the city.
4834774 4836316 A very foolish one...
4836484 4840731 who wasted many hours slaying dragons<br />instead of attending to his studies.
4840905 4843657 - This was yours?<br />- Yes, it was mine.
4843825 4845616 My father had it made for me.
4846661 4847990 Well...
4848163 4850154 I'm taller than you were then.
4850331 4853665 Though I'm not likely to grow anymore, except sideways.
4856629 4858669 Never fitted me either.
4858839 4861675 Boromir was always the soldier.
4864679 4867086 They were so alike, he and my father.
4869183 4870808 Proud.
4870976 4872174 Stubborn even.
4873938 4875432 But strong.
4876940 4880107 I think you have strength of a different kind.
4880736 4883191 And one day your father will see it.
4887367 4891151 Here do I swear fealty and service to Gondor...
4891329 4892824 in peace or war...
4893457 4895912 in living or dying...
4897294 4898538 from...
4901214 4904001 From this hour henceforth...
4904175 4906084 until my lord release me...
4907595 4909801 or death take me.
4910389 4912880 And I shall not forget it...
4913058 4916428 nor fail to reward that which is given.
4924028 4926316 Fealty with love.
4927405 4929066 Valor with honor.
4930659 4933992 Disloyalty with vengeance.
4942629 4946709 I do not think we should so lightly<br />abandon the outer defenses...
4946883 4949635 defenses that your brother long held intact.
4949802 4952293 - What would you have me do?<br />- I will not yield...
4952472 4955259 the river in Pelennor unfought.
4955433 4957093 Osgiliath must be retaken.
4957268 4959308 My lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
4959979 4962766 Much must be risked in war.
4965401 4969351 Is there a captain here who still<br />has the courage to do his lord's will?
4975577 4978827 You wish now that our places had been exchanged...
4979790 4982625 that I had died and Boromir had lived.
4986046 4987789 Yes.
4988465 4990671 I wish that.
4999058 5001549 Since you were robbed of Boromir...
5003396 5006314 I will do what I can in his stead.
5014490 5018950 If I should return, think better of me, Father.
5021038 5024656 That will depend on the manner of your return.
5107956 5110281 What are you up to?
5110458 5111703 Sneaking off, are we?
5112419 5114245 Sneaking?
5115254 5117412 Sneaking?
5118841 5122007 Fat Hobbit is always so polite.
5122178 5127254 Smeagol shows them secret ways<br />that nobody else could find...
5127433 5129591 and they say "sneak."
5130227 5132801 Sneak?
5133438 5136143 Very nice friend. Oh, yes, my precious.
5136316 5138938 - Very nice, very nice.<br />- All right. All right!
5140195 5142401 You just startled me is all.
5142906 5144733 What were you doing?
5146368 5148490 Sneaking.
5148870 5151955 Fine. Have it your own way.
5154209 5156700 I'm sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo.
5157087 5159043 We have to be moving on.
5164218 5165796 It's dark still.
5165970 5168176 It's always dark here.
5172435 5174343 It's gone!
5175563 5178433 - The Elven bread.<br />- What?
5178607 5180066 That's all we have left.
5184154 5186646 He took it. He must have!
5187157 5190408 Smeagol? No, no, not poor Smeagol.
5190577 5193495 Smeagol hates nasty Elf bread.
5193664 5196830 You're a lying rat! What did you do with it?!
5197000 5198542 He doesn't eat it.
5199545 5201870 - He can't have taken it.<br />- Look.
5202922 5204750 What's this?
5207427 5210761 Crumbs on his jacketses. He took it!
5211472 5213133 He took it.
5213975 5218186 I seen him. He's always stuffing<br />his face when master's not looking.
5218355 5220146 That's a filthy lie!
5220314 5222521 You stinking, two-faced sneak!
5222691 5223937 - Sam!<br />- Call me...
5224110 5225355 Stop it!
5226362 5227560 Sam!
5228864 5232482 - I'll kill him!<br />- Sam! No!
5233536 5239075 Oh, my... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it<br />to go so far. I was just so... So angry.
5239249 5241372 Here, just... Let's<br />just rest a bit.
5241543 5243619 - I'm all right.<br />- No.
5243795 5246880 No, you're not all right. You're exhausted.
5247048 5249171 It's that Gollum.
5249342 5251051 It's this place.
5251219 5253792 It's that thing around your neck.
5257309 5258589 I could help a bit.
5258768 5261437 I could carry it for a while.
5261605 5263348 Carry it for a while.
5263523 5264768 I could carry it... I could carry it.
5265400 5270856 Share the load... Share the<br />load... the load... the load.
5271030 5272229 Get away!
5272407 5273984 I don't want to keep it.
5277579 5279570 I just want to help.
5281624 5284246 See? See?
5284418 5287834 He wants it for himself.
5288006 5289713 Shut up, you!
5290257 5292084 Go away! Get out of here!
5292259 5294086 No, Sam.
5294261 5295506 It's you.
5299725 5301432 I'm sorry, Sam.
5303103 5304478 But he's a liar.
5304646 5307315 He's poisoned you against me.
5308734 5310642 You can't help me anymore.
5312612 5314485 You don't mean that.
5316992 5318783 Go home.
5398821 5400612 Faramir!
5400781 5402690 Faramir!
5404201 5406241 Your father's will has turned to madness.
5407412 5409452 Do not throw away your life so rashly.
5410207 5412532 Where does my allegiance lie if not here?
5413168 5416086 This is the city of the Men of Numenor.
5416713 5419500 I will gladly give my life to defend her beauty...
5419674 5422878 her memory, her wisdom.
5425263 5428679 Your father loves you, Faramir.
5429392 5432393 He will remember it before the end.
5502004 5503546 Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
5506529 5508023 Well...
5508573 5510197 yes.
5510909 5514657 At least, well enough for my own people.
5516289 5518696 But we have no songs for great halls...
5519750 5520995 and evil times.
5521835 5525002 And why should your songs be unfit for my halls?
5527800 5529211 Come, sing me a song.
5540271 5543604 Home is behind
5543773 5547522 The world ahead
5549946 5555782 And there are many paths to tread
5557578 5561113 Through shadow
5561290 5565454 To the edge of night
5567129 5572207 Until the stars are all alight
5575221 5579549 Mist and shadow
5579725 5584018 Cloud and shade
5586398 5589732 All shall fade
5592112 5596109 All shall
5601872 5604244 Fade
5628647 5632099 March! March!
5632276 5637483 March! March! March!
5640952 5643277 Make way for the king.
5644789 5646780 Make way.
5649250 5651290 The king is here.
5653255 5654879 My lord.
5656133 5658089 Hail to you, sire.
5658552 5659749 Grimbold, how many?
5659928 5662383 I bring 500 men from the Westfold, my lord.
5663348 5666017 We have 300 more from Fenmarch, Theoden King.
5667143 5671092 - Where are the riders from Snowborn?<br />- None have come, my lord.
5688164 5690287 Six thousand spears.
5691333 5693326 Less than half of what I'd hoped for.
5693627 5696996 Six thousand will not be enough<br />to break the lines of Mordor.
5699758 5701501 More will come.
5701885 5704839 Every hour lost hastens Gondor's defeat.
5705013 5707586 We have till dawn, then we must ride.
5727076 5729401 The horses are restless...
5729579 5731073 and the men are quiet.
5731539 5734658 They grow nervous in the shadow of the mountain.
5737128 5739001 That road there...
5739922 5741998 where does that lead?
5742758 5746590 It is the road to the Dimholt,<br />the door under the mountain.
5747304 5750305 None who venture there ever return.
5751516 5753390 That mountain is evil.
5776332 5778159 Aragorn.
5778918 5780827 Let's find some food.
5797311 5798722 There.
5799688 5802689 A true esquire of Rohan.
5806320 5808312 I'm ready.
5809907 5811186 Sorry.
5811367 5813607 It isn't all that dangerous.
5814119 5816444 It's not even sharp.
5817122 5820538 Well, that's no good. You won't<br />kill many Orcs with a blunt blade.
5820709 5822203 Come on.
5826380 5828872 To the smithy. Go!
5830343 5832881 You should not encourage him.
5833054 5835509 You should not doubt him.
5835682 5838967 I do not doubt his heart, only the reach of his arm.
5841688 5843265 Why should Merry be left behind?
5843439 5846060 He has as much cause to go to war as you.
5848235 5851401 Why can he not fight for those he loves?
5854658 5857659 You know as little of war as that Hobbit.
5858912 5860988 When the fear takes him...
5861164 5866206 and the blood and the screams and<br />the horror of battle take hold...
5866586 5868744 do you think he would stand and fight?
5871299 5872924 He would flee.
5873093 5875132 And he would be right to do so.
5877347 5881297 War is the province of Men, Eowyn.
5916968 5920669 I choose a mortal life.
5923600 5926470 I wish I could've seen him...
5927604 5930309 one last time.
5941492 5942903 Sir?
5944746 5947319 King Theoden awaits you, my lord.
5968101 5970058 I take my leave.
5984700 5985946 My lord Elrond.
5986536 5990035 I come on behalf of one whom I love.
5993125 5995118 Arwen is dying.
5999923 6003968 She will not long survive the<br />evil that now spreads from Mordor.
6004720 6008089 The light of the Evenstar is failing.
6008265 6012263 As Sauron's power grows, her strength wanes.
6012436 6016184 Arwen's life is now tied to the fate of the Ring.
6016940 6019513 The Shadow is upon us, Aragorn.
6019902 6021561 The end has come.
6021946 6024566 It will not be our end, but his.
6025323 6028906 You ride to war, but not to victory.
6029911 6033576 Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith, this you know.
6033748 6038161 But in secret he sends another force<br />which will attack from the river.
6038628 6042044 A fleet of Corsair ships sails from the south.
6042674 6044750 They'll be in the city in two days.
6045259 6048094 You're outnumbered, Aragorn.
6048804 6050928 You need more men.
6051307 6053051 There are none.
6054810 6058724 There are those who dwell in the mountain.
6067739 6069898 Murderers...
6070075 6071486 traitors.
6073954 6076112 You would call upon them to fight?
6076289 6077867 They believe in nothing.
6078041 6080164 They answer to no one.
6080335 6083419 They will answer to the king of Gondor.
6090553 6095678 Anduril, the Flame of the West,<br />forged from the shards of Narsil.
6109989 6114402 Sauron will not have forgotten the Sword of Elendil.
6128465 6133210 The blade that was broken shall return to Minas Tirith.
6133387 6135794 The man who can wield the power of this sword...
6135972 6139839 can summon to him an army more<br />deadly than any that walks this earth.
6141686 6143844 Put aside the Ranger.
6144022 6147355 Become who you were born to be.
6147525 6149518 Take the Dimholt road.
6153240 6155430 Ónen i-Estel Edain.<br />(I give hope to the Dúnedain.)
6159180 6163440 Ú-chebin Estel anim.<br />(I have kept no hope for myself.)
6175552 6177213 Why are you doing this?
6177679 6180882 The war lies to the east. You<br />cannot leave on the eve of battle.
6183310 6185385 You cannot abandon the men.
6186688 6188265 Eowyn...
6188439 6190646 We need you here.
6191776 6193650 Why have you come?
6195321 6197278 Do you not know?
6206582 6209583 It is but a shadow and a thought that you love.
6213505 6215914 I cannot give you what you seek.
6229438 6233352 I have wished you joy since first I saw you.
6252502 6254790 Just where do you think you're off to?
6254962 6256291 Not this time.
6256464 6258670 This time you must stay, Gimli.
6261386 6264220 Have you learned nothing of<br />the stubbornness of Dwarves?
6264389 6268053 You might as well accept it.<br />We're going with you, laddie.
6290372 6292530 - What's happening?<br />- Where is he going?
6292874 6294748 Where's he going?
6297337 6299376 I don't understand.
6303802 6305593 Lord Aragorn!
6306012 6308716 Why does he leave on the eve of battle?
6309933 6312009 He leaves because there is no hope.
6312685 6314808 He leaves because he must.
6314978 6316687 Too few have come.
6316856 6319014 We cannot defeat the armies of Mordor.
6321527 6323187 No...
6323612 6324857 we cannot.
6327741 6331525 But we will meet them in battle nonetheless.
6345967 6347711 I have left instruction.
6350388 6353638 The people are to follow your rule in my stead.
6360231 6362473 Take up my seat in the Golden Hall.
6363735 6366570 Long may you defend Edoras...
6366738 6369063 if the battle goes ill.
6370157 6373573 What other duty would you have me do, my lord?
6375788 6377745 Duty?
6379917 6381245 No.
6389551 6391674 I would have you smile again...
6395098 6400093 not grieve for those whose time has come.
6404941 6408440 You shall live to see these days renewed...
6412782 6415533 and no more despair.
6421749 6425449 What kind of army would linger in such a place?
6425628 6427455 One that is cursed.
6429424 6431961 Long ago, the Men of the Mountains swore an oath...
6432384 6435136 to the last king of Gondor...
6435721 6437298 to come to his aid...
6437472 6439180 to fight.
6439683 6441841 But when the time came...
6442478 6445098 when Gondor's need was dire...
6445271 6447145 they fled...
6447315 6450685 vanishing into the darkness of the mountain.
6451736 6454061 And so Isildur cursed them...
6455615 6459482 never to rest until they had fulfilled their pledge.
6463790 6466956 Who shall call them from the grey twilight?
6467418 6469660 The forgotten people.
6469837 6472328 The heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
6472799 6474672 From the north shall he come.
6475176 6476835 Need shall drive him.
6477929 6481427 He shall pass the door to the Paths of the Dead.
6499908 6503194 The very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.
6508750 6510707 The way is shut.
6511461 6513418 It was made by those who are dead.
6514046 6516288 And the Dead keep it.
6516841 6518383 The way is shut.
6529729 6531223 Brego!
6534734 6537438 I do not fear death.
6549748 6552156 Well, this is a thing unheard-of.
6552334 6556996 An Elf will go underground where a Dwarf dare not?
6557172 6558500 Oh.
6558673 6561508 Oh, I'd never hear the end of it.
6576524 6578766 We must ride light and swift.
6578943 6580686 It is a long road ahead.
6580861 6583946 And man and beast must reach the<br />end with the strength to fight.
6589453 6592454 Little Hobbits do not belong in war, Master Meriadoc.
6592789 6594782 All my friends have gone to battle.
6594958 6596832 I would be ashamed to be left behind.
6597002 6599125 It is a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.
6599296 6601668 And none of my riders can bear you as a burden.
6602674 6604797 I want to fight.
6605302 6607294 I will say no more.
6624112 6626069 Ride with me.
6627532 6628942 My lady.
6629116 6631488 Form up! Move out!
6631661 6634864 Form up! Move out!
6637958 6639156 Ride!
6639335 6642289 Ride now to Gondor!
6683920 6685663 What is it?
6685838 6687380 What do you see?
6687631 6689754 I see shapes of men.
6692428 6693803 And of horses.
6694555 6695753 Where?
6695931 6698885 Pale banners like shreds of cloud.
6701312 6703517 Spears rise...
6704147 6707599 like winter-thickets through a shroud of mist.
6708860 6711018 The Dead are following.
6712239 6713733 They have been summoned.
6714408 6716234 The Dead?
6716618 6718326 Summoned?
6718745 6720619 I knew that.
6723958 6725702 Very good.
6726419 6728495 Very good! Legolas!
6766458 6767868 Do not look down.
6820469 6825594 Who enters my domain?
6829353 6831558 One who will have your allegiance.
6834523 6839862 The Dead do not suffer the living to pass.
6840196 6842865 You will suffer me.
6866387 6869757 The way is shut.
6870934 6875394 It was made by those who are dead.
6875772 6879935 And the Dead keep it.
6889076 6892161 The way is shut.
6893915 6896536 Now you must die.
6900421 6903256 I summon you to fulfill your oath.
6903591 6908548 None but the king of Gondor may command me.
6914143 6916300 That line was broken.
6918939 6921145 It has been remade.
6929073 6930616 Fight for us...
6930784 6933322 and regain your honor.
6937498 6938827 What say you?
6951053 6952595 What say you?
6953347 6955139 You waste your time, Aragorn.
6955308 6958474 They had no honor in life, they have none now in death.
6958978 6961469 I am Isildur's heir.
6962023 6963979 Fight for me...
6964566 6968149 and I will hold your oaths fulfilled.
6972074 6974031 What say you?
6981958 6984165 You have my word!
6984460 6988459 Fight, and I will release you from this living death!
6989925 6991419 What say you?!
6994721 6997675 Stand, you traitors!
7024624 7025656 Out!
7047021 7048599 Legolas!
7049733 7050930 Run!
7117256 7119331 We fight.
7129685 7132258 Open the gate! Quick!
7163301 7165293 Quick! Hurry!
7179065 7180690 Faramir!
7181694 7184943 Say not that he has fallen.
7186115 7187657 They were outnumbered.
7188074 7189652 None survived.
7190368 7192361 Fear.
7192913 7196116 The city is rank with it.
7198460 7200915 Let us ease their pain.
7201171 7202914 Release the prisoners.
7203089 7205047 Catapults!
7218395 7221847 My sons are spent.
7222900 7225817 My line has ended.
7228656 7230067 He's alive!
7230240 7233407 The House of Stewards has failed.
7233577 7235035 He needs medicine, my lord.
7236080 7238748 My line has ended!
7240250 7242243 My lord!
7255766 7257592 Rohan...
7258351 7260758 has deserted us.
7275200 7278403 Theoden's betrayed me.
7289548 7291375 Abandon your posts!
7292426 7296340 Flee! Flee for your lives!
7306481 7308023 Prepare for battle!
7308566 7311732 Hurry, men! To the wall! Defend the wall!
7312904 7314861 Over here!
7315615 7317987 Return to your posts!
7328794 7331415 Send these foul beasts into the abyss.
7341598 7343057 Stay where you are.
7360032 7361443 We need more rubble!
7361617 7363491 Watch out!
7363661 7366199 Down to the lower levels. Quick!
7368082 7369624 Double up, men!
7438609 7441610 Hold them back! Do not give in to fear.
7442113 7445611 Stand to your posts! Fight!
7486280 7487904 Not at the towers!
7488073 7491074 Aim for the trolls! Kill the trolls!
7491827 7493654 Bring them down!
7528779 7530819 Fight them back!
7530990 7532983 Peregrin Took!
7533868 7537034 - Go back to the Citadel!<br />- They'd called us out to fight.
7552720 7555092 This is no place for a Hobbit.
7580830 7582289 Guard of the Citadel, indeed.
7582916 7586249 Now, back, up the hill. Quickly. Quick!
7597596 7600550 What are you doing, you useless scum?!
7600724 7602682 The door won't give. It's too strong.
7609024 7611431 Get back there and smash it down.
7611609 7613602 But nothing can breach it.
7616531 7618773 Grond will breach it.
7622203 7624279 Bring up the wolf's head.
7627458 7632797 Grond! Grond! Grond! Grond!
7633131 7636963 Grond! Grond! Grond!
7638886 7642302 Grond! Grond! Grond!
7643015 7646680 Grond! Grond! Grond!
7647102 7651266 Grond! Grond! Grond!
7651440 7655141 Grond! Grond! Grond!
7671200 7672973 You may go no further.
7676413 7678916 You will not enter Gondor.
7679541 7681961 Who are you to deny us passage?
7682044 7686006 Legolas, fire a warning shot past the bosun's ear.
7687779 7689343 Mind your aim.
7696078 7698623 That's it. Right. We warned you.
7698831 7700812 Prepare to be boarded.
7702585 7703721 Boarded?
7703732 7705713 By you and whose army?
7707173 7708945 This army.
7726150 7727609 In there.
7729695 7731415 What is this place?
7735951 7739235 Master must go inside the tunnel.
7740904 7744397 Now that I'm here, I don't think I want to.
7747055 7748776 It's the only way.
7751383 7753155 Go in...
7753635 7755841 or go back.
7758681 7761302 I can't go back.
7774113 7776657 - What's that smell?<br />- Orcses' filth.
7776668 7779615 Orcses come in here sometimes.
7785218 7786469 Hurry.
7791734 7793298 This way.
7796322 7797938 Smeagol?
7799085 7801066 Over here.
7810190 7812536 It's sticky. What is it?
7813318 7815038 You will see.
7815612 7817489 Oh, yes.
7817958 7820822 You will see.
7830105 7831669 Smeagol?
7833442 7834467 Smeagol!
7837091 7838760 Smeagol!
7848352 7849809 Sam.
7950275 7952590 And you, Frodo Baggins...
7952600 7957536 I give you the light of<br />Earendil, our most beloved star.
7958773 7961995 May it be a light for you in dark places...
7962036 7965628 when all other lights go out.
7965654 7969512 Aiya Earendil Elenion Ancalima!<br />(Hail Earendil brightest of the Stars!)
8042135 8044952 Naughty little fly.
8045576 8048913 Why does he cry?
8049330 8052510 Caught in a web
8052927 8055137 Soon you'll be...
8055513 8057340 Eaten.
8095469 8097387 Got away, did it, precious?
8097815 8099587 Not this time.
8099796 8102765 - Not this time!<br />- No!
8110066 8112941 It wasn't us. It wasn't us!
8113872 8116427 Smeagol wouldn't hurt master.
8116583 8118106 We promised.
8118564 8121014 You must believe us.
8121119 8122660 It was the precious.
8123465 8127621 The precious made us do it.
8145048 8147643 I have to destroy it, Smeagol.
8157091 8159987 I have to destroy it for both our sakes.
8170438 8171495 No!
8195045 8197140 I'm so sorry, Sam.
8202031 8204187 I'm so sorry.
8230496 8234761 This task was appointed to you, Frodo of the Shire.
8236283 8238421 If you do not find a way...
8239933 8241549 no one will.
8275280 8277395 The scouts report Minas Tirith is surrounded.
8277886 8279852 The lower level's in flames.
8280597 8282771 Everywhere, legions of the enemy advance.
8283569 8284768 Time is against us.
8284820 8286065 Make ready!
8286332 8288065 Take heart, Merry.
8288418 8290451 It will soon be over.
8291514 8292745 My lady...
8293495 8295873 you are fair and brave...
8296394 8298636 and have much to live for...
8300252 8302284 and many who love you.
8305466 8307800 I know it is too late to turn aside.
8308959 8311546 I know there is not much point now in hoping.
8312921 8316518 If I were a knight of Rohan, capable of great deeds...
8316519 8319471 But<br />- I'm not.
8319907 8321481 I'm a Hobbit.
8324630 8326695 And I know I can't save Middle-earth.
8330490 8332398 I just want to help my friends.
8334817 8335988 Frodo.
8337320 8338579 Sam.
8340656 8342206 Pippin.
8343993 8347225 More than anything, I wish I could see them again.
8351187 8353252 Prepare to move out!
8353627 8356870 Make haste. We ride through the night.
8373292 8374283 To battle.
8374960 8376264 To battle.
8399568 8400932 Back to the gate!
8401653 8403384 Hurry!
8423550 8427785 I am steward of the House of Anarion.
8428242 8430431 Thus have I walked.
8431891 8434811 And thus now will I sleep.
8441015 8442804 Gondor is lost.
8443517 8446718 There is no hope for Men.
8461868 8464161 Why do the fools fly?
8466091 8468790 Better to die sooner than late.
8471252 8472995 For die we must.
8485642 8488978 No tomb for Denethor and Faramir.
8489812 8495339 No long, slow sleep of death embalmed.
8496016 8500645 We shall burn, like the heathen kings of old.
8504775 8506153 Bring wood and oil.
8509415 8510325 Steady.
8511031 8512539 Steady.
8527401 8529695 You are soldiers of Gondor.
8530216 8534543 No matter what comes through that<br />gate, you will stand your ground.
8540820 8541821 Run!
8544240 8545544 Volley!
8546451 8547866 Fire!
8661543 8663263 Let him go, you filth.
8665317 8666704 Let him go!
8668320 8670405 You will not touch him again.
8673690 8675150 Come on and finish it.
8785309 8786433 Back!
8797665 8798812 Mr. Frodo.
8808613 8810074 Oh, no.
8810699 8812207 Frodo.
8812836 8814376 Mr. Frodo.
8819322 8820448 Wake up.
8824566 8826704 Don't leave me here alone.
8828529 8830666 Don't go where I can't follow.
8835098 8836245 Wake up.
8843178 8845107 Not asleep.
8847453 8849174 Dead.
8868099 8869975 You get back, you scum!
8879412 8880976 What's this?
8881831 8884729 Looks like old Shelob's been having a bit of fun.
8886554 8888900 Killed another one, has she?
8889213 8891038 No.
8893957 8896058 This fellow ain't dead.
8896063 8898232 Not dead?
8898753 8904175 - She jabs him with her stinger,<br />and he goes as limp as a boned fish.
8904853 8907460 Then she has her way with them.
8908033 8910067 That's how she likes to feed.
8910223 8912152 Fresh blood.
8912361 8914550 Get him to the tower!
8918252 8920003 Samwise, you fool.
8920045 8922892 This scum will be awake in a couple of hours.
8923204 8925446 Then he'll wish he'd never been born.
8949949 8952973 The house of his spirit crumbles.
8954329 8955580 He is burning.
8956883 8958239 Already burning.
8958604 8960168 He's not dead.
8960950 8962514 He's not dead!
8964599 8966276 No! No!
8966789 8968770 No! No!
8969239 8971220 He's not dead!
8971741 8975026 - Farewell, Peregrin, son of Paladin.<br />- No! No! No!
8975234 8978363 I release you from my service.
8979718 8984045 Go now and die in what way seems best to you.
8986402 8988456 Pour oil on the wood!
8990353 8992216 Come on, soldier! Move it!
8992960 8995638 - Hurry along there! Hurry along!<br />- Gandalf!
8996297 8997548 Where is Gandalf?
8999008 9000050 Gandalf!
9005837 9006880 Retreat!
9009070 9010790 The city is breached!
9010946 9013866 Fall back! To the second level!
9017724 9019496 Get the women and children out!
9019601 9021269 Get them out!
9021540 9022885 Retreat!
9022989 9024971 Come on. Come on, move.
9025179 9029506 Move into the city. Kill all in your path.
9037587 9039829 Take them down!
9060630 9063446 Fight! Fight to the last man!
9063602 9065114 Fight for your lives!
9065524 9066457 Gandalf!
9070713 9071891 Gandalf!
9071996 9074655 Denethor has lost his mind!
9074863 9077053 He's burning Faramir alive!
9077094 9079034 Up! Quickly!
9086124 9087323 Go back to the abyss.
9089148 9092484 Fall into the nothingness that<br />awaits you and your master.
9092837 9099158 Do you not know death when you see it, old man?
9099366 9103402 This is my hour.
9113651 9114641 Gandalf!
9123890 9127102 You have failed.
9128165 9133045 The world of Men will fall.
9190236 9191330 Courage, Merry.
9191904 9193990 Courage for our friends.
9197817 9200945 Form ranks, you maggots. Form ranks!
9200976 9204156 Pikes in front. Archers behind.
9212393 9215573 Eomer, take your Eored down the left flank.
9215813 9216877 Flank ready.
9217346 9219796 Gamling, follow the king's banner down the center.
9219953 9223759 Grimbold, take your company<br />right after you pass the wall.
9224071 9226470 Forth, and fear no darkness!
9226887 9230536 Arise, arise, Riders of Theoden!
9230911 9236062 Spears shall be shaken...<br />Shields shall be splintered...
9236375 9239868 a sword-day, a red day...
9240191 9243545 and the sun rises!
9251598 9256082 Whatever happens, stay with me. I'll look after you.
9262286 9264319 Ride now!
9265831 9267693 Ride now!
9268542 9271357 Ride! Ride for ruin...
9271566 9274746 and the world's ending!
9276153 9280064 - Death!<br />- Death!
9281158 9284234 - Death!<br />- Death!
9285006 9286841 - Death!<br />- Death!
9287258 9291533 - Death!<br />- Death!
9295652 9298154 For Eorlingas!
9341269 9342573 Fire!
9346795 9348620 Death!
9352165 9353886 Charge!
9353938 9355025 Fire at will!
9413006 9415873 Set a fire in our flesh.
9433776 9435424 Stay this madness!
9439845 9444182 You may triumph in the field of battle for a day...
9444818 9448353 but against the power that has risen in the east...
9448718 9451585 there is no victory.
9481145 9482814 No!
9482876 9485733 You will not take my son from me!
9485764 9487871 No!
9499080 9500487 Faramir.
9514303 9518004 So passes Denethor, son of Ecthelion.
9545948 9548034 Drive them to the river!
9550380 9552674 Make safe the city!
9592452 9594172 Re-form the line!
9595372 9597248 Re-form the line!
9604443 9607206 Sound the charge! Take them head-on!
9607675 9609865 Charge!
9688692 9689943 Cut him down!
9716949 9719399 Take the reins. Pull him left!
9721797 9722892 Left!
9740670 9742130 Aim for their heads!
9748177 9751514 Bring it down! Bring it down! Bring it down!
9757196 9758135 Merry!
9765381 9766789 Merry!
9840246 9842175 I didn't think it would end this way.
9843531 9844990 End?
9846367 9848588 No, the journey doesn't end here.
9850871 9853801 Death is just another path...
9854667 9856669 one that we all must take.
9857638 9861204 The grey rain curtain of this world rolls back...
9861308 9864749 and all turns to silver glass.
9867043 9868816 And then you see it.
9870734 9873247 What, Gandalf?
9874415 9875854 See what?
9876975 9878982 White shores...
9880859 9883101 and beyond.
9884665 9886541 A far green country...
9887303 9890034 under a swift sunrise.
9894205 9895926 Well...
9895978 9897542 that isn't so bad.
9897563 9898845 No.
9901191 9902807 No, it isn't.
9919125 9922514 Rally to me! To me!
9943472 9947851 Feast on his flesh.
9952283 9954420 I will kill you if you touch him.
9954431 9959947 Do not come between the Nazgul and his prey.
10028920 10032309 Late as usual, pirate scum!
10032543 10034342 There's knife-work here needs doing.
10034394 10038213 Come on, you sea rats! Get off your ships!
10053345 10055721 There's plenty for the both of us.
10055821 10058167 May the best Dwarf win.
10075528 10077755 You fool.
10077926 10081342 No man can kill me.
10083713 10086890 Die now.
10097529 10099563 I am no man.
10116089 10119588 - 15! 16!<br />- 17!
10127391 10129301 Merry!
10171309 10173101 Legolas!
10195500 10197872 33, 34.
10244965 10247337 That still only counts as one!
10247467 10249667 Come on, then. Come on!
10293387 10296222 I know your face...
10298006 10299927 Eowyn.
10302521 10304893 My eyes darken.
10305983 10307421 No.
10308235 10309924 No.
10311931 10314438 I am going to save you.
10315763 10318109 You already did.
10321790 10323414 Eowyn...
10324866 10327409 my body is broken.
10332420 10334922 You have to let me go.
10340787 10343382 I go to my fathers...
10344833 10347689 in whose mighty company...
10348107 10351482 I shall not now feel ashamed.
10368054 10369709 Eowyn.
10416174 10418671 Release us.
10420527 10422302 Bad idea.
10422456 10426183 Very handy in a tight spot, these<br />lads, despite the fact they're dead.
10426209 10428468 You gave us your word.
10430145 10432335 I hold your oath fulfilled.
10433560 10435019 Go.
10435724 10437561 Be at peace.
10480862 10482801 Merry.
10483375 10486711 No!
10490256 10493019 No!
10516668 10520598 With a sigh.
10520713 10524476 You turn away.
10524613 10528648 With a deepening heart.
10528679 10533580 No more words to say.
10533705 10537229 You will find.
10537281 10545779 That the world has changed forever.
10570470 10578280 And the trees are now turning from green to gold.
10582148 10586965 And the sun is now fading.
10587070 10597142 I wish I could hold you closer.
10599973 10601250 Merry!
10602793 10604900 Merry!
10616244 10618071 Merry.
10620540 10621785 Merry, it's me.
10624398 10625961 It's Pippin.
10628464 10630753 I knew you'd find me.
10630925 10632123 Yes.
10634554 10636630 Are you going to leave me?
10637181 10638889 No, Merry.
10640184 10642426 I'm going to look after you.
10686125 10687848 Hands off!
10688002 10691189 That shiny shirt, that's mine.
10691442 10695606 It's going to the Great Eye,<br />along with everything else.
10697125 10701035 I don't take orders from stinking Morgul-rats!
10701817 10706978 You touch it, and I'll stick this blade in your gut.
10727467 10729396 The scum tried to knife me.
10729448 10731390 Kill him!
10834551 10836617 That's for Frodo!
10836897 10839124 And for the Shire!
10842528 10844838 And that's for my old Gaffer!
10874277 10877663 Stop your squealing, you dunghill rat.
10878761 10883501 I'm gonna bleed you like a stuck pig.
10890752 10892506 Not if I stick you first.
10892629 10894193 Sam!
10899250 10901335 Oh, Sam, I'm so sorry.
10901387 10903520 Sorry for everything.
10903733 10907690 - Let's get you out of here.<br />- It's too late. It's over.
10907800 10910733 They've taken it. Sam...
10911501 10913027 they took the Ring.
10913743 10916489 Begging your pardon, but they haven't.
10928445 10930672 I thought I'd lost you.
10931052 10932759 So I took it.
10933919 10936005 Only for safekeeping.
10937256 10939009 Give it to me.
10942521 10944769 Give me the Ring, Sam.
10949403 10950689 Sam.
10952270 10954238 Give me the Ring.
10974949 10976250 You must understand.
10979745 10981593 The Ring is my burden.
10982769 10984927 It will destroy you, Sam.
10988086 10990064 Come on, Mr. Frodo.
10991371 10993027 We best find you some clothes.
10993196 10996232 You can't go walking through<br />Mordor in naught but your skin.
11017970 11020176 We did it, Mr. Frodo.
11020681 11022969 We made it to Mordor.
11024309 11025969 There are so many of them.
11026937 11029510 We'll never get through unseen.
11034642 11037986 It's him, the Eye.
11045705 11048327 We have to go in there, Mr. Frodo.
11048792 11050831 There's nothing for it.
11053838 11058251 Come on. Let's just make it down the hill for starters.
11067435 11070852 Frodo has passed beyond my sight.
11072127 11074994 The darkness is deepening.
11075046 11077340 If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.
11077351 11079776 It's only a matter of time.
11081250 11083689 He has suffered a defeat, yes but...
11084743 11089227 behind the walls of Mordor, our enemy is regrouping.
11089383 11091156 Let him stay there.
11091166 11094044 Let him rot! Why should we care?
11094107 11099445 Because 10,000 Orcs now stand<br />between Frodo and Mount Doom.
11106118 11108672 I've sent him to his death.
11110185 11111507 No.
11112010 11114428 There is still hope for Frodo.
11114773 11118901 He needs time and safe passage<br />across the plains of Gorgoroth.
11119986 11122559 - We can give him that.<br />- How?
11122906 11125610 Draw out Sauron's armies.
11125773 11127906 Empty his lands.
11128119 11131203 Then we gather our full strength<br />and march on the Black Gate.
11131768 11134832 We cannot achieve victory through strength of arms.
11135001 11136578 Not for ourselves.
11136773 11142381 But we can give Frodo his chance if<br />we keep Sauron's Eye fixed upon us.
11144176 11147960 Keep him blind to all else that moves.
11148712 11149921 A diversion.
11150068 11151890 Certainty of death...
11151997 11154811 small chance of success...
11155646 11157265 what are we waiting for?
11157836 11160264 Sauron will suspect a trap.
11161068 11163107 He will not take the bait.
11164613 11167104 Oh, I think he will.
11201420 11204131 Long have you hunted me.
11204339 11206320 Long have I eluded you.
11207937 11209733 No more.
11211378 11213858 Behold the Sword of Elendil.
11258350 11260862 The city has fallen silent.
11262521 11265578 There is no warmth left in the sun.
11266379 11268087 It grows so cold.
11271071 11274128 It's just the damp of the first spring rain.
11280508 11283721 I do not believe this darkness will endure.
11312309 11313925 Look, the Orcs...
11314395 11316460 they're moving off.
11317512 11319588 You see, Mr. Frodo...
11319765 11322090 some luck at last.
11322267 11324094 Move it, you slugs!
11325343 11328764 Come on! Faster!
11336656 11339888 Come along, you coldhearted wretched scum...
11339899 11344448 I'll whip you down to the bone, you...
11347292 11348960 Come on!
11349127 11351338 What have I told you?
11351358 11353652 No evation...
11354642 11356467 Now move it!
11358292 11359796 Get up!
11360169 11362848 Come on, you slugs!
11362984 11366633 You two are going straight to the front line!
11366811 11372107 Now, move it! Go on! Fall<br />in! Move it! Move it! Move it!
11384672 11388478 To the Gate, you slugs! Now, move it!
11397914 11401507 Don't you know we're at war?
11423825 11426695 Company, halt!
11430498 11433908 Inspection!
11434043 11436540 Sam, help me.
11436702 11438539 Mr. Frodo!
11441237 11443796 Stand up, Mr. Frodo. Stand up!
11443948 11445796 It's so heavy.
11454897 11456101 Oh, no.
11461726 11463729 What do I do? What do we do?
11466783 11467946 - Hit me.<br />- What?
11468087 11470157 Hit me, Sam. Start fighting.
11470328 11471906 Get off of me!
11472570 11474906 Nobody pushes me, you filthy maggot.
11483518 11485589 Get off of me!
11486490 11488420 Break it up! Break it up!
11490974 11495594 Oi! I'll have your guts if you<br />don't shut this rabble down!
11495614 11498053 Go, Sam. Now!
11506979 11508531 Move along, scum!
11508699 11510608 Back in the line!
11511097 11512910 You maggots!
11513548 11516580 Get back into the line, you slugs!
11518918 11522452 Dig it, you slugs. Move it.
11571156 11573300 I can't...
11573450 11577219 I can't... I can't manage the Ring, Sam.
11577308 11578548 It's... It's...
11578716 11581299 It's such a weight to carry.
11582156 11583219 It's...
11583356 11585354 Such a weight.
11590289 11592792 We're going that way. Straight as we can.
11594147 11597380 There's no point carrying<br />anything we're not sure to need.
11612446 11614377 Mr. Frodo.
11615835 11617381 Look.
11619850 11621801 There is light...
11622143 11623707 and beauty up there...
11623968 11626437 that no shadow can touch.
11677458 11679114 Take mine.
11679595 11681739 There's a few drops left.
11696904 11699540 There will be none left for the return journey.
11700449 11703637 I don't think there will be<br />a return journey, Mr. Frodo.
11756493 11758683 Frodo, get down!
11760403 11762354 Hide!
11772499 11774538 Frodo!
11780319 11781792 Where are they?
11817855 11820913 Let the Lord of the Black Land come forth!
11821818 11824674 Let justice be done upon him!
11868113 11872125 My master, Sauron the Great, bids thee welcome.
11877966 11881677 Is there any in this rout with<br />authority to treat with me?
11882033 11885184 We do not come to treat with Sauron...
11885317 11887872 faithless and accursed.
11887882 11891886 Tell your master this: The<br />armies of Mordor must disband.
11891990 11894806 He is to depart these lands, never to return.
11895744 11898324 Old Greybeard.
11899654 11904042 I have a token I was bidden to show thee.
11909049 11910377 Frodo.
11913219 11914678 Frodo.
11915399 11916878 - Silence.<br />- No!
11917484 11919052 Silence!
11920821 11924600 The Halfling was dear to thee, I see.
11925513 11929687 Know that he suffered greatly at the hands of his host.
11935053 11940953 Who would've thought one so<br />small could endure so much pain?
11943551 11945705 And he did, Gandalf.
11945845 11947620 He did.
11954552 11956129 And who is this?
11956220 11958379 Isildur's heir?
11958514 11961556 It takes more to make a king<br />than a broken Elvish blade.
11966282 11968886 I guess that concludes negotiations.
11971026 11972224 I do not believe it.
11974206 11975613 I will not.
11991671 11993504 Pull back.
11993756 11995838 Pull back!
12008041 12010102 It's gone, Mr. Frodo.
12012003 12015549 The light's passed on, away towards the north.
12015653 12017569 Something's drawn its gaze.
12035047 12037840 Hold your ground! Hold your ground.
12039687 12043924 Sons of Gondor, of Rohan, my brothers!
12046725 12048682 I see in your eyes...
12049019 12053105 the same fear that would take the heart of me.
12055066 12058820 A day may come when the courage of Men fails...
12058841 12062439 when we forsake our friends and<br />break all bonds of fellowship.
12062469 12065285 But it is not this day.
12065545 12068613 An hour of wolves and shattered shields...
12068778 12071659 when the age of Men comes crashing down.
12071801 12074288 But it is not this day.
12074460 12076120 This day we fight!
12078214 12082254 By all that you hold dear on this good earth...
12082426 12086673 I bid you stand, Men of the West!
12175132 12178677 Never thought I'd die fighting<br />side by side with an Elf.
12179146 12181471 What about side by side with a friend?
12184985 12186770 Aye.
12187592 12189404 I could do that.
12219706 12221803 Do you remember the Shire, Mr. Frodo?
12224763 12227016 It'll be spring soon.
12227787 12230523 And the orchards will be in blossom.
12230655 12234361 And the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket.
12235712 12239741 And they'll be sowing the summer<br />barley in the lower fields...
12240769 12245167 and eating the first of the strawberries with cream.
12247077 12249578 Do you remember the taste of strawberries?
12251143 12252883 No, Sam.
12253020 12256005 I can't recall the taste of food...
12257139 12260424 nor the sound of water...
12260580 12264183 nor the touch of grass.
12265115 12266689 I'm...
12267566 12268941 naked in the dark.
12270589 12272899 There's... there's nothing.
12273040 12277780 No veil between me and the wheel of fire.
12279035 12280944 I can see him...
12281329 12283031 with my waking eyes.
12284040 12286537 Then let us be rid of it...
12287116 12289368 once and for all.
12290088 12292164 Come on, Mr. Frodo.
12292329 12294961 I can't carry it for you...
12295353 12297424 but I can carry you.
12297960 12299714 Come on!
12330127 12333081 Aragorn.
12344620 12348374 Elessar.
12359218 12361646 For Frodo.
12396598 12398103 Look, Mr. Frodo.
12398788 12401025 A doorway.
12401603 12403273 We're almost there.
12405617 12409567 Clever Hobbits to climb so high!
12423499 12425170 Mustn't go that way.
12426679 12429177 Mustn't hurt the precious.
12429338 12431092 You swore!
12431267 12433343 You swore on the precious!
12435229 12437187 Smeagol promised!
12438097 12440100 Smeagol lied.
12492577 12494493 Frodo!
12521564 12523349 Eagles.
12524744 12526269 The eagles are coming!
12549091 12550964 Frodo!
12556181 12557503 I'm here, Sam.
12564940 12566606 Destroy it!
12577139 12580445 Go on! Now!
12580580 12583159 Throw it in the fire!
12596533 12599223 What are you waiting for?
12601069 12603472 Just let it go!
12636676 12638918 The Ring is mine.
12642463 12644217 No.
12644601 12645923 No.
12654350 12657029 No!
12761434 12763339 Yes!
12764510 12766217 Yes!
12767325 12770216 Precious! Precious!
12770349 12773557 Precious! Precious!
12826445 12828314 Give me your hand!
12836663 12839071 Take my hand!
12841720 12843080 No!
12850323 12852300 Don't you let go.
12856891 12858469 Don't let go.
12860072 12861562 Reach!
12950733 12953604 Frodo!
12954174 12957196 Frodo!
13038527 13040396 It's gone.
13044835 13046610 It's done.
13047077 13049112 Yes, Mr. Frodo.
13050466 13052905 It's over now.
13078566 13080938 I can see the Shire.
13083154 13085479 The Brandywine River.
13087586 13089609 Bag End.
13091913 13094659 Gandalf's fireworks.
13095041 13098831 The lights in the Party Tree.
13100306 13103457 Rosie Cotton dancing.
13104581 13107296 She had ribbons in her hair.
13110212 13113176 If ever I was to marry someone...
13114070 13116343 it would've been her.
13117771 13119847 It would've been her.
13131952 13135202 I'm glad to be with you, Samwise Gamgee...
13139459 13142418 here at the end of all things.
13252069 13254150 Gandalf?
13273757 13275791 Frodo!
13295549 13297397 Gimli!
13400339 13404129 Now come the days of the king.
13409098 13411464 May they be blessed.
13431724 13434414 This day does not belong to one man...
13434539 13436455 but to all.
13438084 13441043 Let us together rebuild this world...
13441212 13445459 that we may share in the days of peace.
13457582 13461753 Et Earello...<br />(Out of the Great Sea...)
13462014 13469365 Endorenna utulien.<br />(to Middle-Earth I am come.)
13470929 13474787 Sinome maruvan...<br />(In this place will I abide...)
13475621 13481564 ar Hildinyar...<br />(and my heirs...)
13482398 13491470 tenn' Ambar-metta.<br />(unto the ending of the world.)
13499915 13501375 Hannon le.<br />(Thank you.)
13599909 13602027 My friends...
13607312 13610002 you bow to no one.
13654129 13656293 And thus it was.
13656423 13660082 A Fourth Age of Middle-earth began.
13660228 13662798 And the Fellowship of the Ring...
13662939 13667467 though eternally bound by friendship and love...
13667631 13670049 was ended.
13675035 13679858 Thirteen months to the day since<br />Gandalf sent us on our long journey...
13679987 13684240 we found ourselves looking upon a familiar sight.
13686765 13689490 We were home.
13696045 13697918 Hi.
13715074 13717311 Hey, watch the pumpkin.
13765383 13766982 More of the same, Rosie.
13767156 13769148 Good night, lads.
13826693 13830712 How do you pick up the threads of an old life?
13832011 13834259 How do you go on...
13834409 13839637 when in your heart you begin to understand...
13840874 13843848 there is no going back?
13844523 13848230 There are some things that time cannot mend...
13848694 13851653 some hurts that go too deep...
13853386 13856242 that have taken hold.
13894363 13896279 Mr. Frodo?
13899577 13900994 What is it?
13902809 13906780 It's been four years to the day since Weathertop, Sam.
13907449 13910164 It's never really healed.
13914122 13919388 "There and Back Again." A<br />Hobbit's tale by Bilbo Baggins.
13920066 13923924 And "The Lord of the Rings" by Frodo Baggins.
13924393 13926593 You finished it.
13929450 13930975 Not quite.
13931744 13934355 There's room for a little more.
13936957 13941200 Bilbo once told me his part in this tale would end...
13941336 13944653 that each of us must come and go in the telling.
13945507 13948373 Bilbo's story was now over.
13948844 13951792 There would be no more journeys for him...
13951920 13953503 save one.
13954214 13957863 Tell me again, lad, where are we going?
13957967 13960001 To the harbor, Bilbo.
13960157 13962882 The Elves have accorded you a special honor...
13963024 13965677 a place on the last ship to leave Middle-earth.
13967351 13969053 Frodo...
13970479 13975022 any chance of seeing that old Ring of mine again?
13975641 13977893 The one I gave you.
13981532 13983690 I'm sorry, Uncle.
13986224 13988866 I'm afraid I lost it.
13989039 13990831 Oh.
13991385 13992917 Pity.
13995660 13999538 I should like to have held it one last time.
14028661 14033744 Well, here's a sight I have never seen before.
14047899 14051264 The power of the Three Rings is ended.
14052017 14054846 The time has come...
14054989 14058274 for the dominion of Men.
14058795 14062276 I Aear can ven na mar.<br />(The sea calls us home.)
14070681 14072861 I think I'm...
14073028 14077415 quite ready for another adventure.
14108479 14110778 Farewell...
14110929 14113702 my brave Hobbits.
14115621 14117655 My work is now finished.
14121460 14126461 Here at last, on the shores of the sea...
14127091 14129968 comes the end of our Fellowship.
14133503 14136005 I will not say, "Do not weep"...
14136683 14140681 for not all tears are an evil.
14158215 14160155 It is time, Frodo.
14165670 14167704 What does he mean?
14170154 14173045 We set out to save the Shire, Sam.
14174637 14177389 And it has been saved.
14181050 14183729 But not for me.
14184647 14187103 You don't mean that.
14188296 14190393 You can't leave.
14198828 14201574 The last pages are for you, Sam.
14414663 14417534 My dear Sam
14419460 14422793 You cannot always be torn in two.
14422953 14427091 You will have to be one and whole for many years.
14427697 14433299 You have so much to enjoy and to be and to do.
14434422 14437724 Your part in the story will go on.
14438437 14440222 Well...
14442086 14443815 I'm back.
