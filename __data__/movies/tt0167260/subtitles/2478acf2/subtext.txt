1432518 1434433 under one banner.

2151758 2153847 Where are Gondor's armies?
2153847 2155892 You still have friends.

2168688 2171865 Yet for all your subtleties,<br />you have not wisdom.
2173910 2178219 Do you think the eyes<br />of the White Tower are blind?
2178219 2181483 I have seen more than you know.

2187924 2191754 I know who rides<br />with Theoden of Rohan.
2191754 2193452 Oh, yes.
2193452 2197891 Word has reached my ears of this<br />Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

2242501 2246200 they don't actually expect me<br />to do any fighting...
2246200 2247549 do they?
2247549 2250987 You're in the service<br />of the steward now.

8737163 8738207 How?
8738207 8741297 Draw out Sauron's armies.
8741297 8743647 Empty his lands.

10942888 10947458 It's been four years to the day<br />since Weathertop, Sam.
10947458 10950243 It's never really healed.

10971134 10974441 There's room for a little more.
10977053 10981448 FRODO:<br />Bilbo once told me his part<br />in this tale would end,
10981448 10985583 that each of us must come<br />and go in the telling.

11015613 11018355 The one I gave you.
11021488 11023751 Sorry, Uncle.
11026276 11029018 I'm afraid I lost it.

11197969 11200189 It is time, Frodo.
