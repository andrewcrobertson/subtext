60761 61693 <i>The case against Mr. Komarov</i>

69136 71303 <i>orchestrated by this man,</i>

323657 326258 Nice grouping, Grandpa.
327293 330295 Yeah, not bad.
331764 334199 Is that it?
334600 337803 Yep. We found him.
337904 340605 It's not good, John.
341474 343942 Hospital or morgue?
344977 346845 Worse.
347547 351316 When was the last time<br />you spoke to this kid?
352518 354653 It's been a while.
355588 358357 Maybe a few years, even.
359425 363528 Last time I saw him,<br />it was pretty ugly.
365131 367332 Well, there's<br />a few different<br />versions in there,
367334 373105 but my people are pretty sure<br />he's being held<br />at a Moscow prison
373107 375607 awaiting sentencing.
375609 377576 What's he charged with?
377578 379311 It's a nasty sheet.
381314 384516 He'll be lucky<br />to get life.
387320 390856 He can never get<br />out of his own way.
391858 394626 He had a lot of problems.
396629 399030 He's still my kid.
400099 401233 I know.
401235 406671 But it's Russia.<br />They do things<br />differently over there.
409075 410842 Me, too.
413446 414813 Good luck, Poppy.

1865064 1865762 <i>What happened?</i>
1865764 1868198 <i>Some sort of attack</i><br /><i>on the courthouse.</i>
1868200 1869266 <i>Who took him?</i>
1869268 1870467 <i>They don't know yet.</i>
1870469 1872636 <i>What do you mean</i><br /><i>you don't know?</i>
1872770 1873337 <i>Eh...</i>
1873339 1874872 <i>...well it's confusing...</i>
1874874 1878408 <i>Eyewitnesses say</i><br /><i>they saw Komarov...</i>
1879110 1881111 <i>...with an American.</i>
1882213 1884581 <i>What American?</i>
1887252 1889686 John McClane.
1891656 1893223 Let's go.
1896027 1897594 After you.
1897996 1900097 Yeah, I got him.<br />Okay, I'm on it.
1900099 1903333 Look, Mike,<br />we had an unexpected delay.<br />I'm sorry.
1903335 1903800 I understand.
1903802 1906036 This is the last guy on earth<br />I expected to see.
1906038 1908705 Listen to me, Yuri,<br />you have half of Moscow<br />looking for you.
1908707 1910641 I need you to get dressed.<br />Why am I here?
1910643 1913510 Please put on these clothes.<br />Trust me.
1913512 1916346 This is the key to your cuffs.<br />Take these.
1916348 1917514 Oh, my Jesus.
1917516 1918916 Are you okay?<br />What?
1918918 1922152 Do you have<br />the file on Chagarin?
1923054 1925622 This is what you<br />been doing, Jack?
1926090 1927457 Spy shit?
1929527 1930627 This is it?
1930629 1934464 You're a spy? Oh, my God.
1936067 1940003 The 007 of Plainfield,<br />New Jersey.
1940271 1941505 Very nice.
1941507 1943941 McClane, shut up.
1943943 1945742 Take it easy, Oddjob.
1945744 1947477 I'm on vacation.
1947479 1948578 Your mom will be pleased.
1948580 1951181 We thought you were<br />doing drugs or something.
1951183 1951715 Mr. Komarov.
1951717 1955185 Or selling drugs,<br />but that was me, really.
1955187 1958689 Do you have<br />the file on Chagarin?
1958790 1960824 Yes, or no?
1962260 1963026 It's very simple, Yuri.
1963028 1966330 You give me the file,<br />and I get you out of Russia.
1966332 1970033 And you're a free man.<br />What do you say?
1971803 1976173 It's not about me.<br />I don't care about my life.
1977308 1978608 Well, that's the deal.
1978610 1980344 It's the only deal.
1981112 1983347 Come on.
1983715 1987050 Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
1987452 1989286 What's it gonna be?
1990655 1992589 Yes or no?
1992591 1996126 The clock is ticking, Yuri.<br />Come on.
1996694 1998829 You will get me out of here?
1998831 1999696 Only the three of you?
1999698 2001832 Whoa, Nijinsky.<br />I'm not in the gang.
2001834 2004468 I just got off the plane.<br />I'm still jet-lagged.
2004470 2008305 I'm not involved in this.<br />Huh, Jack?
2010208 2013510 Only if I can take<br />my daughter with me.
2016247 2019082 Chagarin's people<br />will kill her.
2020885 2023553 Fine. Make it quick.
2024489 2025355 Ah.
2025357 2026923 Where's the file?
2026925 2030827 It's in a vault in Prypiat,<br />but the key<br />is here in Moscow.
2030829 2032429 At Hotel Ukraina.
2034799 2039903 Make your call.<br />We're going to the Ukraina,<br />let's go.
2047479 2048578 <i>It's papa...</i>
2050215 2051948 <i>I'm fine, Sunshine...</i>
2052250 2053583 <i>...we'll talk later.</i>
2054018 2054484 <i>Listen.</i>
2054486 2058221 <i>I'll be waiting for you</i><br /><i>where your mother and I</i><br /><i>shared our first dance.</i>
2058389 2059456 <i>Now.</i>
2060792 2062926 <i>Hurry! Hurry! You understand?</i>
2072236 2076206 Mike, listen, I'm sorry<br />about this morning, man.
2077408 2079910 It's fine.
2080545 2083413 Okay, let's go.
2087618 2088919 Contact!
2091556 2093156 Down! Get down!
2093158 2095358 Go! Get down! Go, go, go!
2098429 2100130 John, cover!
2115513 2116880 Come on, buddy!
2119016 2121284 Go! Go!
2127358 2129092 That's right, jerk-off!
2129094 2130460 All right, let's move, John!
2130462 2131795 I'm on fucking vacation!
2131797 2134464 Come on, time to hustle.<br />Watch your head.
2136000 2137000 McClane, move it.
2137002 2139569 8,000 fucking miles for this?
2144008 2146276 Get down, Yuri. Stay low!
2146278 2147544 Head down.
2147546 2149646 Come on. Go, go!
2163127 2164995 Safe house, my ass.
2170234 2171635 He knows how old we are, no?
2171637 2172969 Come on.
2177708 2178742 Here, here, here.
2178744 2181178 Sit down.<br />You're all right.
2181180 2182679 Let me look at you.
2182681 2184548 It's all right.<br />You're fine.
2184550 2186449 What are you doing?
2187618 2187984 Jack.
2187986 2190387 Calm down, Yuri, okay?<br />You're gonna be just fine.
2190389 2193823 Here, put this on, stay warm.
2194625 2197727 What was that, John?<br />Five minutes?<br />Five minutes?
2197729 2199596 You blew a three-year op<br />in five minutes!
2199598 2201765 You're welcome!<br />What do you want me to do?
2203801 2204935 Unbelievable.
2204937 2205368 Unbelievable.
2205370 2208605 I'm so fucking burned.<br />I got no friends in<br />this town anymore.
2208607 2212342 What about your<br />people at Langley?<br />Just give them a call.
2212344 2215045 Give me your phone.
2221819 2224354 It's a two-year contract<br />on that phone.
2224356 2227290 What are you carrying?<br />Give me that.
2228526 2230927 All right.<br />You got any cash on you?
2231495 2232662 Some American money.
2232664 2235432 What are you talking about?<br />We need to keep on moving.
2235434 2239736 We have to get<br />this guy to a doctor.<br />To medical attention, Jack.
2239738 2240370 The mission stands.
2240372 2242973 Your mission is<br />bleeding out over there.
2242975 2246009 The mission continues.<br />We go to the hotel.
2249013 2253383 Come on, let's move.<br />Let's move.
2264662 2265295 This is nuts.
2265297 2267264 What, are you going to go out<br />and kill somebody else now?
2267266 2269566 Why all this trouble<br />for just one guy?
2269568 2271901 He's a political prisoner.
2271969 2272535 Not that you care, John,
2272537 2274838 but it's a matter<br />of national security,<br />all right?
2274840 2279376 He's got the goods to<br />stop Viktor Chagarin,<br />and we need that to happen.
2279378 2279976 Well, great, Jack.
2279978 2281845 Let's drop him<br />off at the Embassy,<br />and we can go home.
2281847 2285582 Are you kidding me?<br />After what happened<br />at the safe house?
2285750 2287183 Look,<br />it doesn't work like that,<br />all right?
2287185 2289653 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and I'm a burnable asset.
2289655 2293123 So, I now need that file<br />to un-fuck this mission.
2293125 2294457 Any more questions?
2294459 2295392 Yeah, just one.
2295394 2298528 How come you never called<br />and told me where you were?
2298663 2300730 Like you'd give a shit.
2311442 2314244 All right,<br />hold up, hold up.
2316681 2320717 Okay, Yuri,<br />listen to me, all right?<br />We're almost done.
2320719 2323019 As soon as we get that key,<br />we're gonna grab the file,
2323021 2326022 get you and your daughter<br />out of Russia, all right?
2326024 2327691 All right.
2328025 2331761 Listen to me,<br />you're doing good.<br />All right?
2331763 2335131 I need you to<br />hang here a second.<br />Keep an eye on him, John.
2335133 2335498 Hey, hey.
2335500 2340370 What is it with<br />all this "John" shit?<br />Whatever happened to "Dad?"
2340638 2342706 Good question.
2344975 2348578 In Russia, we have<br />word for men like him.
2349013 2350847 <i>"Krutoi."</i>
2351082 2354217 It means "tough,"<br />"hard."
2354219 2358455 In America, it means<br />"juvenile delinquent."
2359990 2362625 Is he your only child?
2363594 2367063 No. I got a daughter, too.
2367665 2370100 You?
2372269 2375605 I have only my  <i>Solnyschka.</i>
2375607 2379976 When she was little,<br />I was working all the time.
2379978 2383913 I believed work was<br />all that mattered.
2388586 2391588 I screwed my<br />kid's life up, too.
2391590 2392155 You work all the time
2392157 2395091 around the clock<br />most of the time,<br />when you're a cop.
2395093 2401931 I just thought that<br />working all the time<br />was a good thing, you know?
2407204 2409439 I didn't help him<br />at all.
2411976 2414444 It's never too late,
2415446 2416946 I hope.
2419517 2421751 Okay, let's go.
2429960 2433596 All right,<br />Yuri, which part of the<br />building is the ballroom in?
2433598 2434497 Main tower.
2434499 2436499 Main tower.<br />Which floor?
2436501 2437500 Top floor.
2437502 2439035 Top floor.
2439037 2439636 What about security?
2439638 2442272 You remember any guards?<br />Cameras? Anything like that?
2442274 2444073 I don't know.
2444075 2445275 Well,<br />I need you to remember.
2445277 2447577 I was in prison<br />for five years,<br />how should I know?
2447579 2449546 Everything could<br />have changed.<br />I know.
2449548 2453183 Just think, all right?<br />Picture it in your head.
2453317 2455318 The ballroom<br />was closed in '89.
2455320 2457720 I think it's under<br />construction now.
2457722 2458955 So that floor's<br />unsecured.
2458957 2461591 I don't know! Listen!<br />My daughter is in there.
2461593 2462992 I'm scared to death,<br />let's go!
2462994 2465295 Just calm down, Yuri.
2490054 2492922 I guess you have<br />done that before.
2495259 2496893 Smart.
2499163 2501764 I could have done it.
2544308 2546709 Irina?
2547344 2549746 Irina?
2555352 2557654 Irina?
2562359 2563793 Papa.
2567298 2569132 Irina.<br />Papa!
2571769 2574170 That's tender.
2574172 2576673 Really? I wouldn't know.
2586817 2588618 Need a hug?
2590387 2593323 We're not really<br />a hugging family.
2593325 2595158 That's right.
2595894 2598194 <i>We just have to</i><br /><i>get one thing...</i>
2598196 2601130 <i>...and then we're leaving</i><br /><i>Moscow for good.</i>
2601665 2602498 <i>OK?</i>
2602666 2603366 <i>OK.</i>
2610975 2612342 <i>Who are they?</i>
2615012 2617480 The young one<br />works for CIA.
2617548 2621084 The old one is his father.<br />Americans.
2622287 2623987 <i>Then thank God for them.</i>
2625389 2627857 There's something<br />no good about this.
2627859 2629993 Just shut up,<br />all right?
2631261 2632862 I'm telling you, Jack,
2633330 2635264 this smells bad.
2636834 2638167 Just stop, okay?
2638169 2642839 This might seem like a totally<br />foreign concept, you know?
2642841 2645341 I know you love<br />to just run in,<br />making shit up.
2645343 2647310 But like any professional,<br />I have a plan.
2647312 2649445 So let's just<br />stick to it, okay?
2649447 2650546 Just move your plan along.
2650548 2653683 All right, Yuri, come on.<br />Let's grab the key,<br />get out of here.
2653685 2655351 Yes.
2655619 2657820 Just take a moment.
2675873 2677306 How you doing?
2679677 2681411 Fine.
2690554 2693156 How did you get<br />over here so quick?
2696260 2697694 Well...
2698162 2700496 I took Garden Ring.
2700498 2705835 Oh, the Garden Ring.<br />Supposed to<br />always be bad, right?
2715679 2716746 Hey, John.
2716748 2718514 Did you get stuck in traffic?
2720350 2723119 I have it! I have it.
2725989 2728224 Welcome, Americans.
2734031 2736499 Put your goddamn<br />guns down, asshole!
2744776 2747310 <i>Papa, what is going on?</i>
2750481 2752615 Give me your weapons.
2752983 2754550 Come and get them.
2760758 2762258 Really?
2763127 2764594 Really.
2767064 2768464 Papa.
2770701 2772135 Yuri.
2772137 2773636 Do it.
2775038 2777607 I thought you were<br />a problem child.
2795058 2798628 This a part of your plan,<br />Mr. Professional?
2800999 2802698 <i>What are you doing?</i>
2802833 2804867 <i>It's about money, papa...</i>
2804869 2806369 <i>...millions of dollars.</i>
2806371 2807570 <i>You think life was</i><br /><i>easy for me?</i>
2807572 2810606 <i>While you were sitting</i><br /><i>in prison being a victim?</i>
2811642 2812742 But,
2812744 2815545 I'm your father.
2817014 2819148 And I am your daughter.
2819550 2822351 We should kill<br />the old man now.
2822353 2824020 We still need him.
2824022 2825888 But them you can kill.
2826056 2827857 Thank you.
2830894 2832161 Hi.
2832996 2835998 I don't know if I'm<br />saying this right.
2837267 2838501 Hi.
2840003 2844540 Do you know what I hate<br />about the Americans?
2845509 2846976 Everything.
2847911 2850546 Especially cowboys.
2868866 2873569 I could have been a dancer.<br />I swear to God.
2877741 2880776 But nobody supported me.
2885082 2886315 You two
2888485 2891187 have been such a
2891189 2894624 pain in the ass!
2911875 2913609 I prefer dancing, really.
2913611 2919949 But killing is much,<br />much better than<br />working in a grocery shop!
2924021 2925388 Jesus Christ!
2927725 2928858 Nice one.
2941939 2945074 You guys. So arrogant.
2945076 2947576 It's not 1986, you know.
2949413 2951547 Reagan is dead.
2958756 2961857 Sorry. Oh, God.
2971268 2973135 What's funny there?
2973603 2974971 Can't tell you.
2975105 2978474 It's not you.<br />I love these outfits.
2978942 2981811 You guys are<br />looking good.
2989419 2991854 That was enough, thank you.
2995058 2996459 Let's dance.
3013710 3015211 Come on! Come on!
3027391 3028324 Jack!
3028326 3032294 Remember<br />the last time we talked<br />just before you went away?
3033397 3034397 Oh, no! No, no!
3034399 3038067 You're not gonna<br />open up to me<br />right before we die!
3039069 3041270 No,<br />that's not your thing, John.
3041272 3041871 What's my thing?
3041873 3045241 Fucking killing bad guys,<br />that's your thing!
3046276 3048577 You're not gonna die today!
3075739 3077706 Go!
3109706 3111173 Shit!
3111708 3112942 Fuck.
3113677 3115678 We're finished, John.
3124688 3126822 I can't believe this.
3132796 3135965 I can't believe this.<br />This is unbelievable.
3143940 3146575 Jack. Hey!
3154251 3155484 Jesus!
3158989 3160222 Come on!
3167230 3169098 Let's get out<br />of this building!
3184749 3185814 <i>Where are they?</i>
3190120 3191353 Come on.
3215413 3217513 <i>Alik, that's it. We're done!</i>
3217515 3218214 <i>Let's go!</i>
3218216 3219215 <i>Break left!</i>
3219217 3220349 <i>Copy, Commander.</i>
3254318 3255618 <i>Do you have him?</i>
3255685 3256952 Yes.
3256954 3258053 <i>And the file?</i>
3258055 3260055 <i>Does he have it?</i>
3260057 3262625 <i>I need that file, Alik.</i>
3262627 3264660 He's taking us to it.
3265428 3268364 <i>No more mistakes, Alik.</i>
3268366 3270699 <i>And when you have the file...</i>
3270934 3273235 <i>...kill them both.</i>
3274604 3275938 Yes, sir.
3293857 3295257 Shit.
3299362 3301830 That was exciting.
3301832 3304800 Yeah. Loads of fun.
3305568 3307970 You wanna go again?
3310740 3312274 Are you shot?
3312276 3313442 No.
3313543 3315144 No, I'm fine.
3315412 3317413 Let me take a look at that.
3317415 3319448 It's fine.
3320050 3320883 Oh, fuck.
3320885 3325220 I can't believe she betrayed<br />her father for Chagarin.
3326122 3328824 I don't understand that.
3330193 3332828 Someday you will.
3333396 3335064 Kids.
3337967 3340703 What's our next move?
3340937 3343005 I don't know.
3343007 3345040 You don't know?<br />I don't know, all right?
3345042 3348077 I mean, I'm out of moves.<br />I don't know.
3348178 3350012 I don't know.
3351114 3353015 I screwed up.
3353416 3355484 I blew the mission.
3362392 3364927 Well, then we're done, right?
3364929 3366028 Yeah, we're done.
3366030 3367429 We're done.
3367431 3368997 We should just go home.
3368999 3372201 We'll stop by<br />a little pharmacy<br />on our way out of Moscow,
3372203 3376071 get you some Merthiolate<br />or mercury
3376073 3377906 and fix up your<br />little scratches, here.
3377908 3380843 Get you home.<br />Get a little toy set.
3380845 3385280 Get yourself a nice<br />warm glass of milk<br />with a little Bosco in it.
3385282 3387182 Get your CIA slippers.
3387184 3388384 All right.
3388386 3390519 What?<br />I get it.
3390820 3393555 What the hell are we gonna do?
3393923 3396225 What's in the file?
3396227 3399261 Evidence on Chagarin.
3402532 3404600 Evidence about what?
3405034 3407736 Chernobyl.
3409839 3411306 Look, listen to me.
3411308 3413142 Komarov and<br />Chagarin used to have this
3413144 3418747 nasty little<br />side-racket going on<br />back in the day.
3419716 3423952 They siphoned<br />weapons-grade uranium,<br />got greedy,
3424053 3426989 caused the meltdown.
3427924 3431326 Then, you know, they fell out.
3431328 3434596 Former partners, bad break-up.
3435732 3437800 Scumbags.
3438101 3439802 So, Chagarin had<br />Komarov thrown in jail.
3439804 3443038 You know, put him in a hole,<br />forget about him.
3443040 3445607 Doesn't have to worry anymore.
3446342 3449311 So what happened<br />to rescuesque?
3449313 3452114 Well, he grew a conscience.
3453383 3455717 Yeah, well, that figures.
3455719 3459655 Listen, Chagarin is bad news.<br />He's the real deal.
3459657 3464526 If we see this guy in control,<br />we're gonna see<br />the whole thing fall apart.
3464528 3468130 I'm talking terrorism,
3468132 3470199 WMDs,
3470600 3472201 nukes.
3475538 3478507 Someone has to stop him.
3479175 3482678 Well, that's what we do.
3483480 3489051 We go out to Chiapep<br />and we do our thing.
3490453 3492087 Our thing?
3492089 3493388 Yeah.
3493857 3497192 We go out there<br />and kill a lot of scumbags.
3503032 3505968 What? You got<br />something better to do?
3505970 3509137 All right. Pull it.
3509139 3511406 You're not gonna cry,<br />are you?
3511408 3512774 Just pull it.
3512776 3515677 Everybody needs a good cry<br />once in a while, Jack.
3515679 3517713 Don't be ashamed.<br />Pull it.
3517715 3518514 You remember that time when
3518516 3523385 you and Ralphie Mauser<br />were gonna have<br />that house-painting job?
3523387 3524887 Got your finger<br />caught in the ladder,
3524889 3526788 you cried for<br />about five, six days.
3526790 3528590 John, just pull it!
3528658 3530859 All right.
3530861 3533228 On three. Here you go.
3533230 3535531 One, two...
3540236 3541570 Good God.
3541572 3543438 Jesus.
3544374 3547309 When was the last time<br />you had a tetanus shot?
3552482 3554283 You all right?
3554285 3555651 Yeah.
3556653 3558587 We need a car.
3558955 3560522 Atta boy.
3560524 3562391 Back to work.
3581277 3584580 Hey, Watergate,<br />how's that lock coming?
3584582 3586315 Almost there.
3586317 3588584 Here, try these.
3589485 3590252 Come on.
3590254 3592821 Oh, stealing. That's nice.<br />Real nice, John.
3592823 3596391 Yeah, I'm up for the<br />Father of the Year award.
3598361 3599661 Whoa.
3601931 3602864 All right.
3602866 3605467 How'd you know all of these<br />guns were gonna be here?
3605469 3607369 It's a Chechen hangout.
3607371 3609204 Owner doesn't like<br />guns in the club,
3609206 3611573 so these bozos leave<br />them in their cars.
3611575 3613942 You learn a lot<br />in three years.
3613944 3615210 Yeah.
3620450 3623485 Are we really<br />going to Chernobyl?
3623753 3625554 Yeah.
3626322 3627990 The Chernobyl.
3628257 3630125 The radioactive joint?<br />Meltdown?
3630127 3632194 That's the one.
3632895 3634997 It's not the Chernobyl<br />in Switzerland, right?
3634999 3638834 With all the skiing and<br />the snow and everything?
3638836 3641370 You mean Grenoble?
3641738 3645741 No, sorry,<br />we're not going to Grenoble.
3651447 3654850 Eddie Collins's kid<br />took him on<br />vacation last year.
3654852 3656551 They went down to Boca.
3656553 3657386 Oh, yeah?
3657388 3658820 Spent four days at the track.
3658822 3660922 Well, that's nice.
3660924 3662724 That's relaxing.
3662726 3665627 Oh, yeah. Sure.
3666329 3668697 We have to go to Chernobyl?
3668699 3670632 Yeah, sorry about that.
3670634 3674436 But all the radioactive stuff<br />is out, right?
3709707 3712207 <i>Is it as you remember, papa?</i>
3712275 3714009 <i>I don't want to remember.</i>
3715845 3716945 <i>Tough.</i>
3719115 3720282 <i>The file...</i>
3720450 3722184 <i>...is in the inner vault.</i>
3724320 3727656 Very touching.<br />Let's move.
3751247 3753582 Which one is it?
3753584 3756418 <i>Get moving, old goat.</i>
3772835 3777739 Couple of fresh coats of paint<br />and a weedwacker<br />and it's good to go.
3784814 3787883 You know,<br />at first, they denied<br />anything even happened.
3787885 3790719 Held a children's<br />parade the next day<br />to prove it.
3790721 3796057 24 hours later,<br />50,000 residents<br />were evacuated.
3796492 3798894 Never came back.
3799328 3803799 As soon as they<br />get in that vault,<br />Komarov's a dead man.
3806169 3807969 All right.
3851814 3854015 You got a plan?
3854817 3856318 Not really.
3856719 3858620 I kind of thought<br />we'd just wing it.
3858622 3864359 You know,<br />run in, guns blazing,<br />making shit up as we go.
3865094 3866728 Yeah?<br />Yeah.
3870166 3871766 What is this? A pirate gun?
3871768 3874703 Yeah. It's old school, man.
3874705 3876204 Like you, right?
3876206 3878206 Yeah, like me.
3879909 3883979 One of these days,<br />I'm gonna have<br />a long talk with you.
3900396 3902264 Look, Jack,
3902665 3905500 I'm sorry your<br />partner got killed.
3906302 3911506 I'm sorry<br />I fucked up your day.<br />That wasn't my plan.
3912375 3914075 I caused you problems.
3914077 3918413 You know, I came here<br />for something else.
3921250 3925186 And all that other bullshit.<br />I mean,
3928357 3930759 I had a pretty good day.
3932295 3936097 It's fun,<br />running around with you.
3941504 3943705 It's good to see you.
3949345 3952213 I love you, boy.
3957586 3959387 You, too.
3960756 3963825 I want you to know<br />I got your back.
3966996 3969497 I got yours, too.
3973002 3977272 All right.<br />Let's go kill<br />some motherfuckers.
3998729 3999494 <i>Key.</i>
4082611 4085480 Okay,<br />what the fuck is this?
4085482 4089984 I'm losing my patience.<br />The fucking file<br />better be here.
4093355 4097225 Radiation has<br />been pooling in this room<br />for decades.
4098662 4102297 You've underestimated<br />us, Daddy dearest.
4102431 4104699 <i>Bring it in!</i>
4148110 4149978 Atta boy.
4155152 4155884 <i>Come on! Come on!</i>
4155886 4162557 Compound 27-4.<br />It neutralizes radiation,<br />trust me.
4175638 4178840 What's this remind you of?
4180309 4181543 Newark.
4200129 4204566 All clear.<br />We can ditch the suits.
4228390 4231726 The hell is that?
4232528 4237098 One billion euros worth<br />of enriched uranium.
4238434 4240134 What?
4240536 4244205 Don't worry,<br />it's stable in this form.
4244207 4245540 File!
4246775 4250712 Irina, cut the crap,<br />please.
4250714 4255016 No one here is<br />speaking about uranium.<br />Where's the file?
4255719 4258786 No more games,<br />where is the file?
4263759 4267095 That's no longer<br />your concern.
4291621 4292887 <i>Sunshine...</i>
4293355 4294789 <i>...you did well.</i>
4298260 4299894 <i>I told you...</i>
4300029 4301796 <i>...everything would work out.</i>
4304533 4305867 <i>Come to papa.</i>
4319082 4320748 <i>Pap, you're a genius.</i>
4322017 4322917 <i>I know.</i>
4327790 4328890 <i>Load it up.</i>
4331994 4332760 <i>Pegasus?</i>
4333395 4334562 <i>Do you copy?</i>
4382811 4385880 A lot of hardware<br />for a file.
4394457 4396357 <i>Wheels up in five minutes.</i>
4397059 4397959 <i>Perfect.</i>
4438902 4439500 <i>Here you go, sir.</i>
4439502 4442670 <i>Team extraction completed.</i><br /><i>She's all yours.</i>
4442871 4443638 <i>Good.</i>
4473770 4475536 <i>Are you inside?</i>
4475704 4477004 <i>Yes, yes, Viktor.</i>
4478974 4480641 <i>I'm inside.</i>
4483245 4484579 <i>Yuri?</i>
4485747 4486981 <i>You surprised?</i>
4488283 4491752 <i>I'm in the same place</i><br /><i>where it all started...</i>
4492020 4494255 <i>...before you betrayed me.</i>
4494756 4495923 <i>Remember...</i>
4496892 4500394 <i>...you promised to</i><br /><i>give me my life back.</i>
4501096 4502897 <i>You gave it back to me.</i>
4504132 4505600 <i>I thank you for that.</i>
4507669 4509370 <i>And now...</i>
4509372 4511405 <i>...I'm going to take yours.</i>
4540670 4543170 <i>Static 4, we are ready</i><br /><i>for take off.</i>
4544873 4547742 <i>Static 4, do you copy?</i>
4552681 4554415 Yuri!
4557853 4559186 Yuri.
4559188 4561856 Where's the dancer?
4561858 4564592 You okay? You hurt?
4564594 4566327 No.
4568931 4570197 I'm good.
4573468 4575503 I'm all right.
4579675 4582610 What's in these boxes?
4585047 4587615 Thank God you're here,<br />Jack.
4588417 4589617 We have to leave.
4589619 4591819 They're coming<br />back any minute.
4593922 4596857 Just let me<br />get the file.
4596859 4598893 What's in the boxes?
4601997 4604632 It's U-235.
4606001 4608736 Weapons-grade uranium.
4610339 4612707 Armored cases.
4617980 4619747 The bomb kind?
4621083 4623851 Yeah, the bomb kind.
4629191 4630992 Not so fast, Eddie.
4630994 4632526 Are you crazy?
4633095 4634695 Yeah, a little bit.
4634697 4636530 I'm getting the file.
4637366 4640735 No. No, you're not.
4640737 4644338 The key.<br />It's your vault,<br />isn't it, Yuri?
4644340 4647441 What? No. No, I...
4647443 4649844 You put this<br />shit in here, right?
4649846 4651078 What? No.
4651080 4652313 Right?
4652381 4654715 I didn't know, Jack.
4662958 4665126 Is that the dancer<br />down there?
4665128 4666460 What are you talking about?
4666462 4669163 That's a tough break<br />for a good athlete.
4669398 4671999 Jack, you know me.
4673870 4677338 Yeah, I know you. I know you.
4678573 4680675 I know him better.
4682310 4687081 Never was a file,<br />was there, Yuri?
4696091 4698225 Of course there was no file.
4698360 4700761 It was simply bait.
4700862 4703597 What I needed<br />was in this vault.
4703599 4705332 Chagarin was<br />the only one with enough
4705334 4708369 power and influence<br />to get me out of jail.
4709004 4711706 I used him.
4713075 4715209 I used you.
4717212 4719547 It's about money.
4719549 4721382 When's it not about money?
4721384 4723150 You want to arrest me?
4724119 4728956 You're out of<br />your jurisdiction,<br />Detective McClane, aren't you?
4728958 4732626 I wouldn't worry too much<br />about being arrested.
4733428 4735596 See, my boy
4735964 4738265 is in the CIA.
4738267 4740735 No phone call.
4741203 4742703 Spy shit.
4742705 4747541 Goddamn Americans.<br />You think you're so smart.
4747543 4751879 No, I'm not that smart.<br />I'm just on vacation.
4751881 4753914 My boy here,
4754616 4756917 he gonna put<br />a whooping on you.
4762257 4764625 Move!
4769831 4774969 You can say<br />goodbye to your daughter,<br />you dumbwit fuck.
4779741 4782610 Where's your<br />little Soltschanitsa?
4795524 4797691 Shit!<br />God damn it!

4884881 4887915 What the hell is in<br />those goddamn grenades?
4894756 4896090 Go get him!
4896092 4898926 I'm going to the helicopter!
4952815 4954615 <i>Vadim, watch the tail.</i>
4954617 4957284 <i>Copy. You are at 120 meters...</i>
4957953 4959119 <i>...115 meters...</i>
4985347 4987614 <i>There is small arms fire</i><br /><i>coming from the roof.</i>

5336898 5338265 No.
5339334 5341268 I didn't think so.
5342603 5344604 You're hearing things.
5345173 5348241 You got swimmer's ear.
5356217 5360320 We're not gonna grow any<br />third arms or anything,<br />are we?
5360322 5361521 No.
5361523 5363857 You might lose your hair.
5364058 5365525 Laugh it up, kid.
5365527 5368595 This is you,<br />five years from now.

5389718 5391785 I'm your father.
5392286 5395989 Have some respect<br />for your father.
5396391 5398158 Let me ask you something.
5399494 5400794 Do you go<br />looking for trouble
5400796 5404598 or does it always<br />just seem to find you?
5405967 5409603 You know,<br />after all these years,
5409605 5413273 I still ask myself<br />the same question.
