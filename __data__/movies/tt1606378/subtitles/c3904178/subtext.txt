52510 55638 The authorities in Russia<br />are bracing themselves today
55722 57724 for mass protests against the trial
57807 60101 of former billionaire Yuri Komarov.
60185 63480 The case against Mr. Komarov<br />has caused widespread division
63563 67275 amongst the Russian public, some<br />of whom view his incarceration
67358 70320 as a political maneuver<br />orchestrated by this man,
70403 73490 Defense Minister candidate<br />Viktor Chagarin.
73573 75784 (door creaks)

101684 103603 I'm prepared<br />to pay for my sins.
107065 109776 You should prepare<br />yourself too.
111486 112737 Yuri,
114155 117742 let's be civil about this.<br />We were friends once...
119452 121412 ...we could be again.
123039 124499 Just give me the file...
126000 129546 ...and I'll hand your life<br />back to you.
132215 134926 Forget this stupid trial.
137220 139013 I don't want my life back.
146271 153236 You think I'm going<br />to let you talk tomorrow?
155238 157282 No one is going to hear you!
158741 160785 I own everybody in that courtroom.
163246 164914 You don't own me.
177093 179429 Mike!
179512 180722 Chagarin's making a move<br />on Komarov.
181764 184017 -Shit.<br />-See who we got local.

364947 367617 Well, there is a few different<br />versions in there,
367700 370578 but, uh, my people are<br />pretty sure he's being held at
370661 374624 a Moscow prison, awaiting sentencing.
374707 376584 What's he charged with?

2263678 2265179 Come on, this is nuts.
2265263 2267181 What, are you going to go out<br />and kill somebody else now?
2267265 2268849 Why all this trouble for just one guy?
2268933 2270518 He's a political prisoner.
2270601 2273187 Look, not that you care, John,<br />but it's a matter
2273271 2274522 of national security, all right?
2274605 2276524 He's got the goods<br />to stop Viktor Chagarin,
2276607 2278484 and we need that to happen.
2278567 2280111 Well, great, Jack-- let's drop him off
2280194 2281779 at the embassy and we can go home.
2281862 2284365 Are you kidding me?<br />After what happened at the safe house?
2284448 2286367 Look, it doesn't work like that,<br />all right?
2286450 2289287 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and I'm a burnable asset.
2289370 2292206 So, I now need that file<br />to unfuck this mission.
2292290 2293499 Any more questions?
2293582 2295293 Yeah, just one:
2295376 2297336 How come you never called<br />and told me where you were?
2297420 2299964 Like you give a shit.
2302591 2305428 (machines and tools<br />buzzing and whirring)
2310641 2313436 All right, hold up, hold up.
2316314 2317565 Okay.
2317648 2318816 Okay, Yuri,<br />listen to me, all right?
2318899 2320359 We're almost done, all right?
2320443 2322945 Soon as we get that key,<br />we're going to grab the file,
2323029 2325114 get you and your daughter<br />out of Russia, all right?

2334457 2335750 Hey. Hey.
2335833 2337501 What is it with all this "John" shit?
2337585 2339420 Whatever happened to "Dad"?
2339503 2341630 Good question.
2344508 2347386 In Russia, we have word<br />for men like him.
2347470 2349638 (speaks Russian word)
2349722 2353267 It means "tough, hard."
2353351 2356479 In America, it means<br />"juvenile delinquent."
2359065 2362443 Is he your only child?
2362526 2364028 No.
2364111 2366489 I got a daughter, too.
2366572 2369283 You?
2371452 2374622 I have only my Solnyschka.
2374705 2378376 When she was little,<br />I was working all the time.
2379668 2382963 I believed work was all that mattered.
2387718 2389512 I screwed my kid's life up, too.
2390679 2392056 You work all the time,
2392139 2393224 around the clock,
2393307 2394892 most of the time<br />when you're a cop.

2398562 2401065 a good, a good thing, you know?
2405694 2408447 I didn't help him at all.
2411075 2414120 It's never too late.

2435349 2437476 -Top floor.<br />-Top floor.
2437560 2439103 What about security?
2439186 2441605 You remember any guards,<br />cameras, anything like that?
2441689 2443107 I don't know.
2443190 2444817 Well, I-I...<br />I need you to remember.
2444900 2446318 I was in prison for five years.
2446402 2447486 How should I know?

2452450 2454493 The ballroom was closed in '89.
