1821219 1823324 Shut up. Shut up, John.
1823488 1825399 I swear to God,<br />I will put a bullet in you this time.
1825557 1827059 Who do you think you're talking to?
1827225 1828636 The last person I want to see.
1829027 1830370 Well, maybe you missed<br />the whole part back there
1830528 1832439 where I saved you and Papa Geppetto here
1832564 1834475 from a whole bunch of Russian bad guys.
1834632 1836634 You saved? You saved?
1836801 1838178 That's right, saved.
1838236 1839271 (SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
1839337 1840816 - Shut up.<br />- Shut up.
1841005 1842575 You're a world class screw-up,<br />you know that, John?
1842740 1845220 I'm a screw-up? I'm a screw-up?
1845376 1846377 I'm still your father.
1846477 1848081 Yeah, nothing I can do about that.
1848546 1849684 What a joke.
1849848 1851350 Just shut up.<br />Try not to touch anything, all right?
1851516 1853154 You've done enough goddamn damage.
1855486 1857693 The appointment is next week...
1857922 1859367 We will begin immediately.
1859424 1861370 Excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped.
1862327 1864407 I'll call you back. There is a problem with Komarov.
1864429 1865339 What happened?
1865763 1867283 Some sort of attack on the courthouse.
1867599 1868703 Who took him?
1868766 1869767 They don't know yet.
1870235 1871612 What do you mean you don't know?
1872036 1872536 Eh...
1872871 1874350 ...well it's confusing...
1874839 1877376 Eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov...
1878610 1880089 ...with an American.
1881579 1883559 What American?
1886451 1888522 COLLINS: John McClane.
1890855 1892061 Let's go.

1900131 1902475 JACK: Look, Mike,<br />we had an unexpected delay. I'm sorry.
1902533 1903568 I understand.
1903635 1905876 JACK: This is the last guy on earth<br />I expected to see.
1906037 1908397 Listen to me, Yuri,<br />you have half of Moscow looking for you.
1908473 1910233 - I need you to get dressed.<br />- Why am I here?
1910375 1913083 Please put on these clothes. Trust me.
1913244 1915383 This is the key to your cuffs. Take these.
1915546 1916786 Oh, my Jesus.
1916948 1918427 COLLINS: Are you okay?<br />KOMAROV: What?
1918583 1920995 Do you have the file on Chagarin?
1922720 1924461 This is what you been doing, Jack?
1925223 1926293 Spy shit?
1928726 1930171 This is it?
1930328 1933309 (LAUGHING) You're a spy? Oh, my God.
1935667 1938841 The 007 of Plainfield, New Jersey.
1939470 1940676 Very nice.
1940838 1942909 McClane, shut up.
1943274 1944776 Take it easy, Oddjob.
1944943 1946786 I'm on vacation.
1946945 1948288 Your mom will be pleased.
1948446 1950255 We thought you were<br />doing drugs or something.
1950415 1951450 Mr. Komarov.
1951582 1954153 Or selling drugs, but that was me, really.
1954852 1957526 Do you have the file on Chagarin?
1957956 1959663 Yes, or no?
1961592 1962935 It's very simple, Yuri.
1963027 1965303 You give me the file,<br />and I get you out of Russia.
1965997 1968876 And you're a free man. What do you say?
1971602 1975015 It's not about me. I don't care about my life.
1976641 1977711 Well, that's the deal.
1977875 1979183 It's the only deal.
1980178 1982180 Come on.
1983181 1985889 Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
1986718 1988129 What's it gonna be?
1989854 1991993 Yes or no?
1992156 1994966 The clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on.
1996127 1998004 You will get me out of here?
1998162 1999232 Only the three of you?
1999397 2001638 Whoa, Nijinsky. I'm not in the gang.
2001799 2004075 I just got off the plane. I'm still jet-lagged.
2004235 2007148 I'm not involved in this. Huh, Jack?
2009874 2012354 Only if I can take my daughter with me.
2015813 2017918 Chagarin's people will kill her.
2020251 2022390 Fine. Make it quick.
2023588 2024623 Ah.
2024689 2026066 Where's the file?
2027091 2030004 It's in a vault in Prypiat,<br />but the key is herein Moscow.

2187852 2189772 Calm down, Yuri, okay?<br />You're gonna be just fine.
2189854 2192664 Here, put this on, stay warm.
2194625 2197265 What was that, John?<br />Five minutes? Five minutes?
2197428 2199169 You blew a three-year op in five minutes!
2199330 2200970 You're welcome!<br />What do you want me to do?

2205369 2208475 I'm so fucking burned.<br />I got no friends in this town anymore.
2208639 2211449 What about your people at Langley?<br />Just give them a call.
2211609 2213885 Give me your phone.
2216080 2217718 (PHONE SHATTERS)
2221619 2223826 It's a two-year contract on that phone.
2223988 2226127 What are you carrying? Give me that.
2228125 2229763 All right. You got any cash on you?
2230861 2232431 Some American money.
2232597 2235043 What are you talking about?<br />We need to keep on moving.
2235499 2238844 We have to get this guy to a doctor.<br />To medical attention, Jack.
2239003 2240004 The mission stands.
2240204 2242548 Your mission is bleeding out over there.
2242707 2244846 The mission continues. We go to the hotel.
2248646 2252219 Come on, let's move. Let's move.
2263861 2264999 This is nuts.
2265296 2266900 What, are you going to go out<br />and kill somebody else now?
2267064 2268805 Why all this trouble for just one guy?
2269033 2270740 He's a political prisoner.
2271302 2272406 Not that you care, John,
2272570 2274880 but it's a matter<br />of national security, all right?
2275039 2278486 He's got the goods to stop Viktor<br />Chagarin, and we need that to happen.
2278643 2279713 Well, great, Jack.
2279877 2281754 Let's drop him off at the Embassy,<br />and we can go home.
2281912 2284415 Are you kidding me?<br />After what happened at the safe house?
2285750 2287093 Look, it doesn't work like that, all right?
2287251 2289371 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and I'm a burnable asset.
2289420 2292230 So, I now need that file<br />to un-fuck this mission.
2292423 2293493 Any more questions?
2293658 2295103 Yeah, just one.
2295259 2297364 How come you never called<br />and told me where you were?
2298062 2299564 Like you'd give a shit.
2311075 2313077 All right, hold up, hold up.
2316881 2320158 Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right?<br />We're almost done.
2320718 2322857 As soon as we get that key,<br />we're gonna grab the file,
2323054 2325056 get you and your daughter<br />out of Russia, all right?
2325222 2326530 KOMAROV: All right.
2327825 2331705 Listen to me, you're doing good. All right?
2331862 2334182 I need you to hang here a second.<br />Keep an eye on him, John.
2334265 2335403 Hey, hey.
2335566 2339207 What is it with all this "John" shit?<br />Whatever happened to "Dad?"
2339837 2341544 Good question.
2344675 2347417 In Russia, we have word for men like him.
2348179 2349681 <i>"Krutoi."</i>
2350614 2353788 It means "tough," "hard."
2353951 2357296 In America, it means "juvenile delinquent."
2359357 2361462 Is he your only child?
2363060 2365904 No. I got a daughter, too.
2366731 2368938 You?
2371802 2374646 I have only my <i>Solnyschka.</i>
2375373 2378820 When she was little,<br />I was working all the time.
2379710 2382748 I believed work was all that mattered.
2388152 2390655 I screwed my kid's life up, too.
2390921 2391922 You work all the time
2391989 2394902 around the clock most of the time,<br />when you're a cop.
2395326 2400776 I just thought that working all the<br />time was a good thing, you know?
2406737 2408273 I didn't help him at all.
2411342 2413288 It's never too late,
2414612 2415784 I hope.
2418749 2420592 Okay, let's go.
2430294 2432672 All right, Yuri, which part of<br />the building is the ballroom in?
2432763 2433764 Main tower.
2433931 2435501 Main tower. Which floor?
2435599 2436634 Top floor.
2436700 2438304 Top floor.
2438402 2439437 What about security?
2439503 2441346 You remember any guards?<br />Cameras? Anything like that?
2441505 2443382 I don't know.
2443541 2445043 Well, I need you to remember.
2445209 2447211 I was in prison for five years,<br />how should I know?
2447478 2449185 - Everything could have changed.<br />- I know.
2449346 2452020 Just think, all right? Picture it in your head.
2452850 2454830 The ballroom was closed in '89.
2454952 2456954 I think it's under construction now.
2457288 2458733 JACK: So that floor's unsecured.
2458889 2461199 KOMAROV: I don't know! Listen!<br />My daughter is in there.
2461258 2462532 I'm scared to death, let's go!

2585983 2587462 Need a hug?
2590087 2592363 We're not really a hugging family.
2592523 2594093 That's right.
2595859 2597338 We just have to get one thing...
2598195 2600106 ...and then we're leaving Moscow for good.
2600931 2601466 OKAY?
2601932 2602432 OKAY.
2610374 2611318 Who are they?
2614545 2616354 The young one works for CIA.
2617214 2619956 The old one is his father. Americans.
2621785 2622957 Then thank God for them.
2625155 2627294 There's something no good about this.
2627458 2628869 Just shut up, all right?
2630628 2631732 I'm telling you, Jack,
2632630 2634132 this smells bad.
2636166 2637804 Just stop, okay?
2638168 2642514 This might seem like a totally<br />foreign concept, you know?
2642673 2644983 I know you love<br />to just run in, making shit up.
2645075 2646748 But like any professional, I have a plan.
2646910 2648719 So let's just stick to it, okay?
2648879 2650483 Just move your plan along.
2650914 2652757 All right, Yuri, come on.<br />Let's grab the key, get out of here.
2652816 2654227 Yes.
2654918 2656693 Just take a moment.

2690220 2692029 How did you get over here so quick?
2695392 2696564 Well...

2794858 2797498 This a part of your plan, Mr. Professional?
2800531 2801669 What are you doing?
2802366 2803845 It's about money, papa...
2804401 2805903 ...millions of dollars.
2806303 2807577 You think life was easy for me?
2807671 2809591 While you were sitting in prison being a victim?

2812075 2814419 I'm your father.
2816413 2818017 And I am your daughter.
2819249 2821490 We should kill the old man now.
2821652 2822995 We still need him.
2823387 2824764 But then you can kill.

4682077 4685957 Never was a file, was there, Yuri?
4695624 4697103 Of course there was no file.
4697659 4699639 It was simply bait.
4700462 4703238 What I needed was in this vault.
4703398 4705036 Chagarin was the only one with enough
4705100 4707239 power and influence to get me out of jail.
4708170 4710582 I used him.
4712307 4714082 I used you.
4716578 4718683 It's about money.
4718980 4720584 When's it not about money?
4720749 4722023 KOMAROV: You want to arrest me?
4724286 4728757 You're out of your jurisdiction,<br />Detective McClane, aren't you?
4728957 4731494 I wouldn't worry too much<br />about being arrested.
4732627 4734470 See, my boy

4893955 4894956 Go get him!
4895557 4897730 I'm going to the helicopter!

5070799 5072142 CG's shifted...
5073034 5074411 I've got full forward cyclic.
5105400 5106902 I can't hold it.
5109804 5110839 Jesus Christ!
5116578 5117579 Well done,
5118213 5119783 Mr. Super-spy.
5122650 5126393 What a shame your father<br />won't be alive to see you promoted.
5126454 5127489 (LAUGHING)
5127555 5129296 Neither will you.
5139033 5140034 (SCREAMS)
5144139 5146517 Hey! Jack!
5148743 5150620 Hang on, John!

5300795 5301967 Dad!
5304332 5305333 Right here.
5332660 5334298 Did you just call me Dad?
5335963 5337101 No.
5338633 5340112 I didn't think so.
5341936 5343438 You're hearing things.
5344505 5347076 You got swimmer's ear.
5356150 5359154 We're not gonna grow any third arms<br />or anything, are we?
5359320 5360492 No.
5360955 5362696 You might lose your hair.
5363324 5364462 Laugh it up, kid.
5365093 5367630 This is you, five years from now.
5368096 5370098 It's rainwater. You'll be fine.
5370264 5373438 Besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.
5374969 5376846 Now you're a McClane?
5377004 5380315 Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane.
5380475 5381954 John McClane Junior.
5382977 5385423 Well, that makes you a "senior."
5385580 5387082 That's right.
5387248 5388818 Try not to forget it.
5388983 5390621 I'm your father.
5392019 5394829 Have some respect for your father.
5395790 5396996 Let me ask you something.
5399026 5400437 Do you go looking for trouble
5400495 5403442 or does it always just seem to find you?
5405533 5408514 You know, after all these years,
5409370 5412112 I still ask myself the same question.
