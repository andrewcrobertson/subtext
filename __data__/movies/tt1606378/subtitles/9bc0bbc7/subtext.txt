60393 61727 <i>The case against Mr. Komarov</i>
61894 65064 <i>has caused widespread division<br />amongst the Russian public,</i>
65231 68526 <i>some of whom view his incarceration<br />as a political maneuver</i>
68693 73656 <i>orchestrated by this man, defense<br />minister candidate Viktor Chagarin.</i>
80121 81455 <i>What do you want Viktor?</i>
94635 96345 <i>Why are you doing this?</i>
97888 99682 <i>What do you want to accomplish tomorrow?</i>
101684 103894 <i>I'm prepared to pay for my sins.</i>
107356 110234 <i>You should prepare yourself too.</i>
111902 112528 <i>Yuri,</i>
114322 118492 <i>let's be civil about this. We were friends once...</i>
119493 121370 <i>...we could be again.</i>
123247 124832 <i>Just give me the file...</i>
126042 129879 <i>...and I'll hand your life back to you.</i>
132256 135009 <i>Forget this stupid trial.</i>
137511 139221 <i>I don't want my life back.</i>
146646 152735 <i>You think I'm going to let you talk tomorrow?</i>
155363 157573 <i>No one is going to hear you!</i>
158574 161202 <i>I own everybody in that courtroom.</i>
163287 164455 <i>You don't own me.</i>
177093 178302 Mike.
179345 181681 Chagarin's making a move on Komarov.
182306 184016 -Shit.<br />-I'll see if we got local.
253252 254754 <i>We are ready to get started.</i>
255337 256380 <i>Make the call.</i>
262344 264805 <i>You won't disappoint me?</i>

317441 319235 McClane.
321070 322905 Hey, Murph, how you doing?
323072 325199 Nice grouping, Grandpa.
326575 329245 Yeah, not bad.
331080 333123 Is that it?
333958 336752 Yep. We found him.
337378 339547 It's not good, John.
340881 342883 Hospital or morgue?
344134 345761 Worse.
347429 350266 When was the last time<br />you spoke to this kid?
351851 353602 It's been a while.
355062 357273 Maybe a few years, even.
359233 362444 Last time I saw him, it was pretty ugly.
365114 367533 Well, there's<br />a few different versions in there,
367700 372413 but my people are pretty sure<br />he's being held at a Moscow prison
372580 374915 awaiting sentencing.
375082 376876 What's he charged with?
377042 378252 It's a nasty sheet.
380880 383465 He'll be lucky to get life.
387052 389805 He can never get out of his own way.
391348 393559 He had a lot of problems.
395978 397813 He's still my kid.
399356 401066 I know.
401233 405613 But it's Russia.<br />They do things differently over there.
408282 409783 Me, too.
412828 413954 Good luck, Poppy.
414038 415039 Thanks, kid.

563103 564188 <i>Did he?</i>
565314 566982 <i>I'll testify under oath.</i>

1924463 1928384 where I saved you and Papa Geppetto here<br />from a whole bunch of Russian bad guys.
1928551 1930553 You saved? You saved?

1996452 1997495 I understand.
1997578 1999788 This is the last guy on earth<br />I expected to see.
1999955 2002249 Listen to me, Yuri, you have<br />half of Moscow looking for you.
2002416 2004126 -I need you to get dressed.<br />-Why am I here?
2004293 2007004 Please put on these clothes.<br />Trust me.
2007171 2009298 This is the key to your cuffs. Take these.
2009465 2010716 Oh, my Jesus.
2010883 2012343 -Are you okay?<br />-What?
2012510 2014929 Do you have the file on Chagarin?
2016639 2018390 This is what you been doing, Jack?

2034782 2036825 McClane, shut up.
2037201 2038702 Take it easy, Odd job.
2038869 2040704 I'm on vacation.
2040871 2042206 Your mum will be pleased.
2042373 2044166 We thought you were<br />doing drugs or something.
2044333 2045376 Mr. Komarov.
2045501 2048087 Or selling drugs,<br />but that was me, really.
2048796 2051465 Do you have the file on Chagarin?
2051882 2053592 Yes, or no?
2055511 2056845 It's very simple, Yuri.
2056971 2059223 You give me the file,<br />and I get you out of Russia.
2059932 2062810 And you're a free man. What do you say?
2065521 2068941 It's not about me.<br />I don't care about my life.
2070568 2071652 Well, that's the deal.
2071819 2073112 It's the only deal.
2074113 2076115 Come on.
2077116 2079827 Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
2080661 2082037 What's it gonna be?
2083789 2085916 Yes or no?
2086083 2088877 The clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on.
2090045 2091922 You will get me out of here?
2092089 2093173 Only the three of you?
2093340 2095551 Whoa, Nijinsky. I'm not in the gang.
2095718 2098012 I just got off the plane.<br />I'm still jet-lagged.
2098178 2101056 I'm not involved in this. Huh, Jack?
2103809 2106270 Only if I can take my daughter with me.
2109732 2111859 Chagarin's people will kill her.
2114194 2116322 Fine. Make it quick.
2118616 2119992 Where's the file?
2121035 2123912 It's in a vault in Prypiat, but the key<br />is here in Moscow.
2124079 2125205 At Hotel Ukraina.
2126665 2127666 Shit.
2128834 2132671 Make your call.<br />We're going to the Ukraina, let's go.
2140763 2141555 <i>It's papa...</i>
2143682 2144850 <i>I'm fine, Sunshine...</i>
2145684 2146477 <i>...we'll talk later.</i>
2147227 2147728 <i>Listen.</i>
2148854 2151106 <i>I'll be waiting for you<br />where your mother and I shared our first dance.</i>
2151565 2152358 <i>Now.</i>
2154360 2155819 <i>Hurry! Hurry! You understand?</i>
2166121 2168957 Mike, listen, I'm sorry about<br />this morning, man.
2170501 2172670 It's fine.
2173712 2176173 Okay, let's go.
2180678 2181679 Contact!
2184723 2186266 Down! Get down!
2186517 2188102 Go! Get down! Go, go, go!
2191605 2192898 John, cover!
2208622 2209623 Come on, buddy!
2212084 2214044 Go! Go!
2220676 2222386 That's right, jerk-off!
2222469 2223637 All right, let's move, John!
2223804 2225180 I'm on fucking vacation!
2225347 2227224 Come on, time to hustle.<br />Watch your head.
2229268 2230269 McClane, move it.
2230436 2232312 8,000 fucking miles for this?
2237401 2239153 Get down, Yuri. Stay low!
2239403 2240529 Head down.
2240654 2242406 Come on. Go, go!
2256378 2257755 Safe house, my ass.
2263677 2265721 -He knows how old we are, no?<br />-Come on.
2270934 2271935 Here, here, here.
2272186 2274271 Sit down. You're all right.
2274438 2275689 Let me look at you.
2276273 2277608 It's all right. You're fine.
2277775 2279193 What are you doing?
2280694 2281695 Jack.
2281779 2283614 Calm down, Yuri, okay?<br />You're gonna be just fine.
2283781 2286575 Here, put this on, stay warm.
2288535 2291205 What was that, John? Five minutes?<br />Five minutes?
2291371 2293081 You blew a three-year op<br />in five minutes!
2293248 2294541 You're welcome!<br />What do you want me to do?
2296919 2297920 Unbelievable.
2298045 2299129 Unbelievable.
2299296 2302382 I'm so fucking burned.<br />I got no friends in this town anymore.
2302549 2305385 What about your people at Langley?<br />Just give them a call.
2305552 2307805 Give me your phone.
2315562 2317731 It's a two-year contract on that phone.
2317898 2320067 What are you carrying? Give me that.
2322069 2323695 All right. You got any cash on you?
2324780 2326365 Some American money.
2326532 2328951 What are you talking about?<br />We need to keep on moving.
2329409 2332746 We have to get this guy to a doctor.<br />To medical attention, Jack.
2332913 2333914 The mission stands.
2334122 2336458 Your mission is bleeding out over there.
2336625 2338752 The mission continues.<br />We go to the hotel.
2342589 2346134 Come on, let's move. Let's move.
2357771 2358939 This is nuts.
2359231 2360816 What, are you going to go out<br />and kill somebody else now?
2360983 2362734 Why all this trouble for just one guy?
2362943 2364653 He's a political prisoner.
2365237 2366321 Not that you care, John,
2366488 2368782 but it's a matter of national security,<br />all right?
2368949 2372411 He's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin,<br />and we need that to happen.
2372578 2373620 Well, great, Jack.
2373787 2375664 Let's drop him off at the Embassy,<br />and we can go home.
2375831 2378333 Are you kidding me?<br />After what happened at the safe house?
2379668 2381003 Look, it doesn't work like that,<br />all right?
2381169 2383171 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and I'm a burnable asset.
2383338 2386133 So, I now need that file<br />to un-fuck this mission.
2386341 2387426 Any more questions?
2387593 2389011 Yeah, just one.
2389177 2391305 How come you never called<br />and told me where you were?
2391972 2393473 Like you'd give a shit.
2411742 2412784 Shit.
2413327 2415120 Well, we're not going in the front door.
2425255 2427257 All right, hold up, hold up.
2431053 2434348 Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right?<br />We're almost done.
2434890 2437017 As soon as we get that key,<br />we're gonna grab the file,
2437225 2439227 get you and your daughter<br />out of Russia, all right?
2439394 2440687 All right.
2442022 2445859 Listen to me, you're doing good.<br />All right?
2446026 2448278 I need you to hang here a second.<br />Keep an eye on him, John.
2448445 2449571 Hey, hey.
2449738 2453367 What is it with all this "John" shit?<br />Whatever happened to "Dad?"
2454034 2455702 Good question.
2458872 2461583 In Russia, we have word for men like him.
2462376 2463877 <i>"Krutoi."</i>
2464795 2467965 It means "tough," "hard."
2468131 2471468 In America, it means<br />"juvenile delinquent."
2473553 2475639 Is he your only child?
2477224 2480060 No. I got a daughter, too.
2480894 2483105 You?
2485983 2488819 I have only my <i>Solnyschka.</i>
2489569 2492990 When she was little,<br />I was working all the time.
2493907 2496910 I believed work was all that mattered.
2502332 2504835 I screwed my kid's life up, too.
2505085 2506086 You work all the time
2506169 2509089 around the clock<br />most of the time, when you're a cop.
2509506 2514928 I just thought that working all the time<br />was a good thing, you know?
2520934 2522436 I didn't help him at all.
2525522 2527441 It's never too late,
2528775 2529943 I hope.
2532946 2534781 Okay, let's go.
2544458 2546835 All right, Yuri, which part of the<br />building is the ballroom in?
2546960 2547961 Main tower.
2548128 2549671 Main tower. Which floor?
2549796 2550797 Top floor.
2550881 2552466 Top floor.
2552591 2553592 What about security?
2553675 2555510 You remember any guards?<br />Cameras? Anything like that?
2555677 2557554 I don't know.
2557721 2559222 Well, I need you to remember.
2559389 2561391 I was in prison for five years,<br />how should I know?
2561641 2563351 -Everything could have changed.<br />-I know.
2563518 2566188 Just think, all right?<br />Picture it in your head.
2567022 2571151 The ballroom was closed in '89.<br />I think it's under construction now.
2571485 2572903 So that floor's unsecured.
2573070 2575489 I don't know! Listen!<br />My daughter is in there.
2575655 2578825 -I'm scared to death, let's go!<br />-Just calm down, Yuri.
2603892 2605936 I guess you have done that before.
2608563 2609898 Smart.
2612734 2614778 I could have done it.
2657571 2659739 Irina?
2660574 2662742 Irina?
2668582 2670667 Irina?
2675672 2676798 Papa.
2680760 2682262 -Irina.<br />-Papa!
2685140 2687142 That's tender.
2687767 2689686 Really? I wouldn't know.
2700197 2701656 Need a hug?
2704284 2706578 We're not really a hugging family.
2706745 2708288 That's right.
2710081 2711541 <i>We just have to get one thing...</i>
2712417 2714294 <i>...and then we're leaving Moscow for good.</i>
2715128 2715670 <i>OK?</i>
2716129 2716546 <i>OK.</i>
2724596 2725513 <i>Who are they?</i>
2728767 2730560 The young one works for CIA.
2731436 2734147 The old one is his father.<br />Americans.
2735982 2737150 <i>Then thank God for them.</i>
2739361 2741488 There's something no good about this.
2741655 2743073 Just shut up, all right?
2744824 2745951 I'm telling you, Jack,
2746826 2748328 this smells bad.
2750372 2751998 Just stop, okay?
2752374 2756711 This might seem like a totally<br />foreign concept, you know?
2756878 2759172 I know you love to just run in,<br />making shit up.
2759297 2760966 But like any professional,<br />I have a plan.
2761132 2762926 So let's just stick to it, okay?
2763093 2764552 Just move your plan along.
2765136 2766846 All right, Yuri, come on.<br />Let's grab the key, get out of here.
2767013 2768431 Yes.
2769140 2770892 Just take a moment.
2789369 2790370 How you doing?
2792998 2794499 Fine.
2804426 2806219 How did you get over here so quick?
2809597 2810765 Well...
2811683 2814477 I took Garden Ring.
2814728 2818898 Oh, the Garden Ring.<br />Supposed to always be bad, right?
2829034 2830160 Hey, John.
2830452 2831578 Did you get stuck in traffic?
2833913 2836207 I have it! I have it.
2839502 2841421 Welcome, Americans.
2847969 2849804 Put your goddamn guns down, asshole!
2858521 2860482 <i>Papa, what is going on?</i>
2864069 2865695 Give me your weapons.
2866488 2867739 Come and get them.
2874120 2875330 Really?
2876498 2877665 Really.
2880418 2881544 Papa.
2884089 2886716 -Yuri.<br />-Do it.
2888885 2890678 I thought you were a problem child.
2909072 2911699 This a part of your plan, Mr. Professional?
2914744 2915870 <i>What are you doing?</i>
2916579 2918039 <i>It's about money, papa...</i>
2918623 2920125 <i>...millions of dollars.</i>
2920500 2921793 <i>You think life was easy for me?</i>
2921876 2923795 <i>While you were sitting in prison being a victim?</i>
2924963 2926131 But,
2926297 2928633 I'm your father.
2930635 2932220 And I am your daughter.
2935682 2937934 We should kill the old man now.
2938101 2939436 We still need him.
2939853 2941187 But them you can kill.
2941646 2943189 Thank you.
2946443 2947485 Hi.
2949195 2951322 I don't know if I'm saying this right.
2952824 2953825 Hi.
2956161 2959831 Do you know what I hate<br />about the Americans?
2961124 2962250 Everything.
2963710 2965837 Especially cowboys.
2998495 3002332 I could have been a dancer.<br />I swear to God.
3007086 3009547 But nobody supported me.
3014093 3015094 You two
3017597 3020099 have been such a
3020308 3023394 pain in the ass!
3034447 3035448 Come on, come on!
3041246 3043122 I prefer dancing, really.
3043831 3048670 But killing is much, much better than<br />working in a grocery shop!
3053091 3054133 Jesus Christ!
3056803 3057804 Nice one.
3071150 3073820 You guys. So arrogant.
3074320 3076322 It's not 1986, you know.
3078491 3080285 Reagan is dead.
3087834 3090587 Sorry. Oh, God.
3100513 3101848 What's funny there?
3102682 3103683 Can't tell you.
3104642 3107186 It's not you. I love these outfits.
3108354 3110523 You guys are looking good.
3118781 3120867 That was enough, thank you.
3124162 3125204 Let's dance.
3142930 3143931 Come on! Come on!
3156319 3157403 Jack!
3158279 3161032 Remember the last time we talked<br />just before you went away?
3162492 3164160 Oh, no! No, no!
3164327 3166788 You're not gonna<br />open up to me right before we die!
3168539 3170208 No, that's not your thing, John.
3170375 3171501 What's my thing?
3171668 3173961 Fucking killing bad guys,<br />that's your thing!
3175588 3177298 You're not gonna die today!
3204701 3206452 Go!
3238651 3239902 Shit!
3240653 3241654 Fuck.
3242905 3244365 We're finished, John.
3254792 3256669 <i>I'm taking care of it now.</i>
3267680 3269223 I can't believe this.
3276063 3278316 I can't believe this.<br />This is unbelievable.
3286657 3288826 Jack. Hey!
3296834 3297835 Jesus!
3301547 3302548 Come on!
3310431 3311432 Let's get out of this building!
3327615 3328241 <i>Where are they?</i>
3334413 3335414 Come on.
3360356 3362024 <i>Alik, that's it. We're done!</i>
3362108 3362692 <i>Let's go!</i>
3362942 3363609 <i>Break left!</i>
3363901 3364610 <i>Copy, Commander.</i>
3398978 3399896 <i>Do you have him?</i>
3400062 3401480 Yes.
3401647 3402481 <i>And the file?</i>
3402732 3404317 <i>Does he have it?</i>
3404901 3407153 <i>I need that file, Alik.</i>
3407320 3408821 He's taking us to it.
3410281 3412658 <i>No more mistakes, Alik.</i>
3413326 3414994 <i>And when you have the file...</i>
3415745 3417496 <i>...kill them both.</i>
3419081 3420124 Yes, sir.
3438351 3439435 Shit.
3443981 3446317 That was exciting.
3446484 3448986 Yeah. Loads of fun.
3450196 3452156 You wanna go again?
3455326 3456452 Are you shot?
3456619 3457620 No.
3458120 3459330 No, I'm fine.
3460164 3461707 Let me take a look at that.
3461874 3463626 It's fine.
3464543 3465962 Oh, fuck.
3466128 3469382 I can't believe she betrayed<br />her father for Chagarin.
3470841 3473010 I don't understand that.
3474887 3477014 Someday you will.
3477848 3479225 Kids.
3482687 3484897 What's our next move?
3485564 3487650 I don't know.
3488067 3489986 -You don't know?<br />-I don't know, all right?
3490236 3492238 I mean, I'm out of moves. I don't know.
3492738 3494198 I don't know.
3495658 3497201 I screwed up.
3498077 3499662 I blew the mission.
3507253 3509380 Well, then we're done, right?
3509547 3511924 -Yeah, we're done.<br />-We're done.
3512091 3514343 We should just go home.
3514510 3517096 We'll stop by a little pharmacy<br />on our way out of Moscow,
3517263 3520891 get you some Merthiolate<br />or mercury
3521058 3522601 and fix up your little scratches, here.
3522935 3525855 Get you home. Get a little toy set.
3526355 3529775 Get yourself a nice warm glass of milk<br />with a little Bosco in it.
3529942 3531569 Get your CIA slippers.
3531736 3532862 All right.
3533029 3534697 -What?<br />-I get it.
3535614 3537742 What the hell are we gonna do?
3538617 3540703 What's in the file?
3540911 3543456 Evidence on Chagarin.
3547251 3548794 Evidence about what?
3549587 3551922 Chernobyl.
3554550 3556135 Look, listen to me.
3556302 3558304 Komarov and Chagarin used to have this
3558471 3562933 nasty little side-racket going on<br />back in the day.
3564977 3568147 They siphoned weapons-grade uranium,<br />got greedy,
3568731 3571150 caused the meltdown.
3572735 3575905 Then, you know, they fell out.
3576155 3578783 Former partners, bad break-up.
3580242 3581994 Scumbags.
3583079 3584830 So, Chagarin had Komarov thrown in jail.
3584997 3587666 You know, put him in a hole,<br />forget about him.
3587833 3589794 Doesn't have to worry anymore.
3591295 3593506 So what happened to rescuesque?
3594131 3596300 Well, he grew a conscience.
3598177 3600763 Yeah, well, that figures.
3600930 3605184 Listen, Chagarin is bad news.<br />He's the real deal.
3605351 3609021 If we see this guy in control,<br />we're gonna see the whole thing fall apart.
3609188 3612358 I'm talking terrorism,
3612525 3614360 WMDs,
3615027 3616362 nukes.
3620199 3622701 Someone has to stop him.
3623953 3626872 Well, that's what we do.
3628666 3633212 We go out to Chiapep<br />and we do our thing.
3634880 3636465 Our thing?
3636549 3637550 Yeah.
3638884 3641387 We go out there<br />and kill a lot of scumbags.
3647977 3650396 What? You got something better to do?
3650563 3653566 All right. Pull it.
3654066 3655776 You're not gonna cry, are you?
3655943 3657778 Just pull it.
3657945 3660030 Everybody needs a good cry<br />once in a while, Jack.
3660531 3662241 -Don't be ashamed.<br />-Pull it.
3662449 3664034 You remember that time when
3664201 3668289 you and Ralphie Mauser were gonna have<br />that house-painting job?
3668455 3671292 Got your finger caught in the ladder,<br />you cried for about five, six days.
3671458 3672751 John, just pull it!
3673210 3675379 All right.
3675546 3677464 On three. Here you go.
3677798 3679717 One, two...
3684722 3685890 Good God.
3686056 3687600 Jesus.
3689435 3691478 When was the last time<br />you had a tetanus shot?
3697109 3698569 You all right?
3698736 3699945 Yeah.
3701280 3702781 We need a car.
3703449 3704950 Atta boy.
3705117 3706452 Back to work.
3726263 3729016 Hey, Watergate, how's that lock coming?
3729183 3730809 Almost there.
3730976 3732770 Here, try these.
3733979 3735147 Come on.
3735314 3737775 Oh, stealing. That's nice.<br />Real nice, John.
3738025 3740569 Yeah, I'm up for the<br />Father of the Year award.
3752748 3753791 Whoa.
3756335 3757795 All right.
3758003 3759964 How'd you know all of these<br />guns were gonna be here?
3760130 3762132 It's a Chechen hangout.
3762299 3766011 Owner doesn't like guns in the club,<br />so these bozos leave them in their cars.
3766428 3768264 You learn a lot in three years.
3768347 3769348 Yeah.
3785406 3786865 You sleeping?
3789702 3790869 I was.
3792871 3794081 Jet-lag.
3800921 3804425 Jeez, when was the last time<br />we were in a car together?
3807052 3809054 Drive home from Trenton.
3810097 3813100 I had to bail you out for that<br />weapons charge.
3813642 3814643 Yeah?
3815811 3818188 No, it was the fire thing, right?
3818397 3820190 When you set South Philly on fire,<br />you mean?
3823902 3826530 We had to take out a second mortgage<br />on the house to make your bail.
3826613 3828741 Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
3829575 3830909 It was funny.
3843297 3845591 Are we really going to Chernobyl?
3846133 3847634 Yeah.
3848761 3850095 The Chernobyl.
3851096 3852431 The radioactive joint? Meltdown?
3852598 3854266 That's the one.
3855934 3857936 It's not the Chernobyl<br />in Switzerland, right?
3858103 3861273 With all the skiing and<br />the snow and everything?
3861440 3863442 You mean Grenoble?
3864777 3867821 No, sorry, we're not going to Grenoble.
3874787 3877289 Eddie Collins's kid<br />took him on vacation last year.
3877456 3878791 They went down to Boca.
3878957 3881126 -Oh, yeah?<br />-Spent four days at the track.
3881335 3883003 Well, that's nice.
3883379 3885047 That's relaxing.
3885214 3887716 Oh, yeah. Sure.
3889051 3891136 We have to go to Chernobyl?
3891303 3893138 Yeah, sorry about that.
3893639 3896517 But all the radioactive stuff<br />is out, right?
3932511 3934346 <i>Is it as you remember, papa?</i>
3934972 3936140 <i>I don't want to remember.</i>
3938225 3939059 <i>Tough.</i>
3941687 3942396 <i>The file...</i>
3943147 3944314 <i>...is in the inner vault.</i>
3947025 3949695 Very touching. Let's move.
3974094 3975596 Which one is it?
3976263 3978557 <i>Get moving, old goat.</i>
4013258 4016762 Couple of fresh coats of paint<br />and a weedwacker and it's good to go.
4024937 4027773 You know, at first, they denied<br />anything even happened.
4027940 4030526 Held a children's parade the next day<br />to prove it.
4031026 4035113 24 hours later,<br />50,000 residents were evacuated.
4035989 4037950 Never came back.
4039660 4042829 As soon as they get in that vault,<br />Komarov's a dead man.
4045457 4047000 All right.
4097551 4099386 You got a plan?
4100512 4101680 Not really.
4102889 4105017 I kind of thought we'd just wing it.
4105183 4109730 You know, run in, guns blazing,<br />making shit up as we go.
4110856 4112107 -Yeah?<br />-Yeah.
4116111 4117571 What is this? A pirate gun?
4117738 4120240 Yeah. It's old school, man.
4120532 4121533 Like you, right?
4121950 4123577 Yeah, like me.
4126538 4129374 One of these days,<br />I'm gonna have a long talk with you.
4146099 4147643 Look, Jack,
4148727 4150896 I'm sorry your partner got killed.
4152898 4156902 I'm sorry I fucked up your day.<br />That wasn't my plan.
4158236 4160238 I caused you problems.
4160405 4163784 You know, I came here for something else.
4167579 4170582 And all that other bullshit. I mean,
4174336 4176129 I had a pretty good day.
4178590 4181468 It's fun, running around with you.
4187432 4189101 It's good to see you.
4195190 4197609 I love you, boy.
4203323 4204783 You, too.
4207035 4209204 I want you to know I got your back.
4212874 4214876 I got yours, too.
4219297 4222634 All right.<br />Let's go kill some motherfuckers.
4244489 4244990 <i>Key.</i>
4335831 4338542 Okay, what the fuck is this?
4339042 4342420 I'm losing my patience.<br />The fucking file better be here.
4347133 4349761 Radiation has been pooling<br />in this room for decades.
4352597 4354808 You've underestimated us,<br />Daddy dearest.
4355433 4357227 <i>Bring it in!</i>
4410822 4412324 Atta boy.
4417829 4418622 <i>Come on! Come on!</i>
4419706 4424711 Compound 27-4.<br />It neutralizes radiation, trust me.
4464042 4467754 All clear. We can ditch the suits.
4505500 4508336 The hell is that?
4510088 4513717 One billion euros worth of<br />enriched uranium.
4515260 4516761 What?
4517971 4521016 Don't worry, it's stable in this form.
4521099 4522142 File!
4524352 4528189 Irina, cut the crap, please.
4528606 4532068 No one here is speaking about uranium.<br />Where's the file?
4533194 4535530 No more games, where is the file?
4541202 4543913 That's no longer your concern.
4568938 4569773 <i>Sunshine...</i>
4570648 4571649 <i>...you did well.</i>
4575570 4576780 <i>I told you...</i>
4577572 4578656 <i>...everything would work out.</i>
4581826 4582744 <i>Come to papa.</i>
4596508 4597634 <i>Pap, you're a genius.</i>
4599177 4599803 <i>I know.</i>
4605100 4605767 <i>Load it up.</i>
4609145 4609646 <i>Pegasus?</i>
4610688 4611439 <i>Do you copy?</i>
4660321 4662699 A lot of hardware for a file.
4672000 4673251 <i>Wheels up in five minutes.</i>
4674210 4674836 <i>Perfect.</i>
4716211 4717212 <i>Here you go, sir.</i>
4717545 4719547 <i>Team extraction completed. She's all yours.</i>
4720048 4720506 <i>Good.</i>
4751079 4752413 <i>Are you inside?</i>
4752997 4753873 <i>Yes, yes, Viktor.</i>
4756292 4757502 <i>I'm inside.</i>
4760421 4761464 <i>Yuri?</i>
4763007 4763841 <i>You surprised?</i>
4766177 4768638 <i>I'm in the same place where it all started...</i>
4769555 4771140 <i>...before you betrayed me.</i>
4772058 4772809 <i>Remember...</i>
4774769 4777272 <i>...you promised to give me my life back.</i>
4778523 4779774 <i>You gave it back to me.</i>
4781567 4782485 <i>I thank you for that.</i>
4784946 4786197 <i>And now...</i>
4786948 4788283 <i>...I'm going to take yours.</i>
4818479 4820064 <i>Static 4, we are ready for take off.</i>
4822275 4824610 <i>Static 4, do you copy?</i>
4829741 4831242 Yuri!
4834912 4836331 Yuri.
4836497 4838666 Where's the dancer?
4839125 4841461 You okay? You hurt?
4841627 4843129 No.
4846007 4847008 I'm good.
4850762 4852305 I'm all right.
4857018 4859437 What's in these boxes?
4862523 4864442 Thank God you're here, Jack.
4865610 4866944 We have to leave.
4867278 4868613 They're coming back any minute.
4871366 4873868 Just let me get the file.
4874160 4875703 What's in the boxes?
4879207 4881459 It's U-235.
4883294 4885546 Weapons-grade uranium.
4887507 4889509 Armored cases.
4895181 4896557 The bomb kind?
4898309 4900645 Yeah, the bomb kind.
4906484 4907985 Not so fast, Eddie.
4908152 4909320 Are you crazy?
4910363 4911864 Yeah, a little bit.
4912031 4913324 I'm getting the file.
4914659 4917495 No. No, you're not.
4918371 4921499 The key.<br />It's your vault, isn't it, Yuri?
4921666 4924710 What? No. No, I...
4925044 4926838 You put this shit in here, right?
4927004 4929132 -What? No.<br />-Right?
4929632 4931509 I didn't know, Jack.
4940476 4942145 Is that the dancer down there?
4942520 4943896 What are you talking about?
4944188 4945982 That's a tough break for a good athlete.
4946649 4949193 Jack, you know me.
4951320 4954157 Yeah, I know you. I know you.
4955825 4957493 I know him better.
4960037 4963875 Never was a file, was there, Yuri?
4973551 4975052 Of course there was no file.
4975595 4977555 It was simply bait.
4978389 4981184 What I needed was in this vault.
4981350 4985188 Chagarin was the only one with enough<br />power and influence to get me out of jail.
4986105 4988524 I used him.
4990234 4992028 I used you.
4994530 4996616 It's about money.
4996908 4998534 When's it not about money?
4998701 4999952 You want to arrest me?
5002246 5006709 You're out of your jurisdiction,<br />Detective McClane, aren't you?
5006918 5009420 I wouldn't worry too much<br />about being arrested.
5010588 5012423 See, my boy
5013132 5015092 is in the CIA.
5015426 5017553 No phone call.
5018471 5019764 Spy shit.
5020431 5024560 Goddamn Americans.<br />You think you're so smart.
5025269 5028898 No, I'm not that smart.<br />I'm just on vacation.
5029065 5030733 My boy here,
5032276 5033736 he gonna put a whooping on you.
5039283 5041452 Move!
5047833 5051796 You can say goodbye to your daughter,<br />you dumbwit fuck.
5057301 5059428 Where's your little Soltschanitsa?
5072817 5074485 -Shit!<br />-God damn it!
5079490 5080491 Shit!
5104223 5105099 <i>Irina, I'm going to the roof..</i>
5105766 5106350 <i>The roof!</i>
5109562 5110855 Jack!
5129206 5130082 <i>Set at 91.</i>
5130374 5131125 <i>Power plant?</i>
5131459 5132293 <i>All good to go.</i>
5132376 5132918 <i>Let's go!</i>
5163115 5164116 Subtle.
5164784 5166911 What the hell is in<br />those goddamn grenades?
5174085 5175086 Go get him!
5175670 5177755 I'm going to the helicopter!
5232393 5234145 <i>Vadim, watch the tail.</i>
5234311 5236313 <i>Copy. You are at 120 meters...</i>
5237398 5238149 <i>...115 meters...</i>
5265426 5266677 <i>There is small arms fire coming from the roof</i>
5281525 5282067 <i>We have a guest.</i>
5283110 5285029 <i>Watch the tail for me there.</i>
5293204 5293704 <i>Come on!</i>
5294205 5295080 <i>Come on, hurry!</i>
5295790 5297708 <i>Vadim, give me firing control now...</i>
5298584 5299210 <i>Engaging!</i>
5305466 5306467 Jack!
5309595 5310137 <i>Shoot him!</i>
5310596 5311555 <i>With pleasure, papa.</i>
5318395 5320314 I'm on fucking vacation!
5323234 5324443 <i>Vadim! He is there! I see him!</i>
5332076 5334161 The shit we do for our kids.
5334578 5336330 Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.
5340960 5341919 <i>What happened?</i>
5350928 5352263 <i>CG's shifted...</i>
5353138 5354515 <i>I've got full forward cyclic.</i>
5385504 5387006 <i>I can't hold it.</i>
5389925 5390968 Jesus Christ!
5396682 5397683 Well done,
5398309 5399894 Mr. Super-spy.
5402771 5406525 What a shame your father<br />won't be alive to see you promoted.
5407651 5409403 Neither will you.
5424251 5426629 Hey! Jack!
5428839 5430716 Hang on, John!
5468379 5469588 John!
5475302 5476679 Come on!
5485354 5486689 <i>We're out of ammunition!</i>
5487231 5488107 <i>Shit.</i>
5489108 5489984 <i>Bastards.</i>
5490484 5492236 <i>What the hell are you doing?</i>
5495114 5495948 <i>This is for you, papa.</i>
5560012 5561013 John!
5563807 5564808 John!
5566351 5567352 John!
5574985 5575986 John!
5580908 5582076 Dad!
5584453 5585454 Right here.
5612773 5614358 Did you just call me Dad?
5616068 5617194 No.
5618737 5620197 I didn't think so.
5622032 5623534 You're hearing things.
5624618 5627204 You got swimmer's ear.
5636255 5639258 We're not gonna grow any<br />third arms or anything, are we?
5639424 5640592 No.
5641051 5642803 You might lose your hair.
5643428 5644555 Laugh it up, kid.
5645222 5647724 This is you, five years from now.
5648225 5650227 It's rainwater. You'll be fine.
5650394 5653564 Besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.
5655065 5656942 Now you're a McClane?
5657109 5660404 Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane.
5660571 5662072 John McClane Junior.
5663073 5665534 Well, that makes you a "senior."
5665701 5667202 That's right.
5667369 5668912 Try not to forget it.
5669079 5670747 I'm your father.
5672124 5674918 Have some respect for your father.
5675919 5677087 Let me ask you something.
5679131 5683552 Do you go looking for trouble or<br />does it always just seem to find you?
5685637 5688599 You know, after all these years,
5689474 5692227 I still ask myself the same question.
