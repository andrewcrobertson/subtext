52803 55522 The authorities in russia<br />are bracing themselves today
55681 57854 For mass protests<br />against the trial
57975 60148 Of former billionaire<br />yuri komarov.
60310 61653 The case against mr. Komarov
61812 64986 Has caused widespread division<br />amongst the russian public,
65148 68493 Some of whom view his incarceration<br />as a political maneuver
68652 71030 Orchestrated by this man,
71154 73577 Defense minister<br />candidate viktor chagarin.
80122 81465 What do you want viktor?
94636 96354 Why are you doing this?
97889 99687 What do you want to accomplish tomorrow?
101685 103904 I'm prepared to pay for my sins.
107357 110201 You should prepare yourself too.
111903 112529 Yuri,
114323 118499 Let's be civil about this. We were friends once...
119494 121371 ...Are could be again.
123248 124841 Just give me the file...
126043 129889 ...And i'll hand your life back to you.
132257 135010 Forget this stupid trial.
137512 139230 I don't want my life hack.
146647 152780 You think i'm going to let you talk tomorrow?
155364 157583 No one is going to hear you!
158575 161203 I own everybody in that courtroom.
163288 164460 You don't own me.
177052 178269 Mike.
179304 181648 Chagarin's making<br />a move on komarov.
182265 183983 Shit.<br />I'll see if we got local.
253211 254713 We are ready to get started.
255297 256344 Make the call.
262345 264814 You won't disappoint me?
270520 272693 Have i ever disappointed you?
278069 278820 Anton.
281364 283366 Alik, it's viktor.
283825 286419 Yuri komarov says hello...
287496 288713 It's time to grab him.
289706 290548 Yuri komarov?
292250 293251 ...And goodbye.
317400 319243 Mcclane.
321071 322914 Hey, murph, how you doing?
323073 325167 Nice grouping, grandpa.
326576 329204 Yeah, not bad.
331081 333083 Is that it?
333917 336716 Yep. We found him.
337337 339510 It's not good, john.
340841 342843 Hospital or morgue?
344094 345767 Worse.
347389 350233 When was the last time<br />you spoke to this kid?
351810 353562 It's been a while.
355021 357274 Maybe a few years, even.
359192 362446 Last time i saw him,<br />it was pretty ugly.
365115 367493 Well, there's a few different<br />versions in there,
367659 372381 But my people are pretty sure he's<br />being held at a moscow prison
372539 374883 Awaiting sentencing.
375041 376839 What's he charged with?
377002 378219 It's a nasty sheet.
380839 383433 He'll be lucky to get life.
387012 389765 He can never get<br />out of his own way.
391308 393527 He had a lot of problems.
395937 397814 He's still my kid.
399316 401034 I know.
401192 405572 But it's russia. They do<br />things differently over there.
408241 409743 Me, too.
412787 413913 Good luck, poppy.
413997 414964 Thanks, kid.
429012 431481 God damn you! God damn it!
444861 447831 Welcome to john f.<br />Kennedy international airport.

539164 541917 I was told you had something to offer me?
545045 547514 You're looking for evidence against yuri komarov?
550967 552310 Perhaps.
556931 559104 Put me in the courtroom with him...
559768 562817 ...And i'll testify that komarov hired me to murder anton.
563104 564196 Did he?
565315 566988 I'll testify under oath.

2283782 2286581 Here, put this on, stay warm.
2288536 2291210 What was that, john? Five minutes?<br />Five minutes?
2291372 2293090 You blew a three-Year op<br />in five minutes!
2293249 2294889 You're welcome!<br />What do you want me to do?
2296920 2299139 Unbelievable.
2299297 2302392 I'm so fucking burned. I got no<br />friends in this town anymore.
2302550 2305394 What about your people at langley?<br />Just give them a call.
2305553 2307806 Give me your phone.
2315563 2317736 It's a two-Year contract<br />on that phone.
2317899 2320072 What are you carrying?<br />Give me that.
2322070 2323697 All right.<br />You got any cash on you?
2324781 2326374 Some american money.
2326533 2328956 What are you talking about?<br />We need to keep on moving.
2329410 2332755 We have to get this guy to a doctor.<br />To medical attention, jack.
2332914 2333915 The mission stands.
2334123 2336467 Your mission is<br />bleeding out over there.
2336626 2338754 The mission continues.<br />We go to the hotel.
2342590 2346140 Come on, let's move.<br />Let's move.
2357772 2358944 This is nuts.
2359232 2360825 What, are you going to go out<br />and kill somebody else now?
2360984 2362736 Why all this trouble<br />for just one guy?
2362944 2364662 He's a political prisoner.
2365238 2366330 Not that you care, john,
2366489 2368787 But it's a matter of national<br />security, all right?
2368950 2372420 He's got the goods to stop viktor<br />chagarin, and we need that to happen.
2372579 2373626 Well, great, jack.
2373788 2375665 Let's drop him off at the<br />embassy, and we can go home.
2375832 2378335 Are you kidding me? After what<br />happened at the safe house?
2379669 2381012 Look, it doesn't work<br />like that, all right?
2381170 2383290 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and i'm a burnable asset.
2383339 2386138 So, i now need that file<br />to un-Fuck this mission.
2386342 2387434 Any more questions?
2387594 2389016 Yeah, just one.
2389178 2391306 How come you never called<br />and told me where you were?
2391973 2393475 Like you'd give a shit.
2411743 2412790 Shit.
2413328 2415126 Well, we're not going in the front door.
2425256 2427258 All right, hold up, hold up.
2431054 2434354 Okay, yuri, listen to me, all right?<br />We're almost done.
2434891 2437019 As soon as we get that key,<br />we're gonna grab the file,
2437226 2439228 Get you and your daughter<br />out of russia, all right?
2439395 2440692 All right.
2442023 2445869 Listen to me, you're doing good.<br />All right?
2446027 2448347 I need you to hang here a second.<br />Keep an eye on him, john.
2448446 2449572 Hey, hey.
2449739 2453369 What is it with all this "john" shit?<br />Whatever happened to "dad?"
2454035 2455708 Good question.
2458873 2461592 In russia, we have<br />word for men like him.
2462377 2463879 "krutoi."
2464796 2467970 It means "tough,"<br />"hard."
2468132 2471477 In america, it means<br />"juvenile delinquent."
2473554 2475648 Is he your only child?
2477225 2480069 No. I got a daughter, too.
2480895 2483114 You?
2485984 2488828 I have only my solnyschka.
2489570 2492995 When she was little,<br />i was working all the time.
2493908 2496912 I believed work was<br />all that mattered.
2502333 2504836 I screwed my<br />kid's life up, too.
2505086 2506087 You work all the time
2506170 2509094 Around the clock most of the<br />time, when you're a cop.
2509507 2514934 I just thought that working all the<br />time was a good thing, you know?
2520935 2522437 I didn't help him at all.
2525523 2527446 It's never too late,
2528776 2529948 I hope.
2532947 2534790 Okay, let's go.
2544459 2546939 All right, yuri, which part of<br />the building is the ballroom in?
2546961 2547962 Main tower.
2548129 2549676 Main tower.<br />Which floor?
2549797 2552471 Top floor.
2552592 2553593 What about security?
2553676 2555519 You remember any guards?<br />Cameras? Anything like that?
2555678 2557555 I don't know.
2557722 2559224 Well, i need you to remember.
2559390 2561392 I was in prison for five<br />years, how should i know?
2561642 2563360 Everything could have changed.<br />I know.
2563519 2566193 Just think, all right?<br />Picture it in your head.
2567023 2568991 The ballroom was closed in '89.
2569150 2571152 I think it's under<br />construction now.
2571486 2572908 So that floor's<br />unsecured.
2573071 2575369 I don't know! Listen!<br />My daughter is in there.
2575448 2576700 I'm scared to death, let's go!
2576783 2578330 Just calm down, yuri.
2603893 2605941 I guess you have<br />done that before.
2608564 2609907 Smart.
2612735 2614783 I could have done it.
2657572 2659745 Irina?
2660575 2662748 Irina?
2668583 2670677 Irina?
2675673 2676799 Papa.
2680761 2682263 Irina.<br />Papa!
2685141 2687143 That's tender.
2687768 2689691 Really? I wouldn't know.
2700156 2701624 Need a hug?
2704285 2706538 We're not really<br />a hugging family.
2706704 2708297 That's right.
2710041 2711509 We just have to get one thing...
2712376 2714299 ...And then we're leaving moscow for good.
2715129 2715630 Ok?
2716130 2716630 Ok.
2724555 2725477 Who are they?
2728726 2730524 The young one works for cia.
2731395 2734148 The old one is his father.<br />Americans.
2735983 2737155 Then thank god for them.
2739320 2741493 There's something<br />no good about this.
2741656 2743033 Just shut up, all right?
2744825 2745917 I'm telling you, jack,
2746827 2748329 This smells bad.
2750331 2752004 Just stop, okay?
2752333 2756713 This might seem like a totally<br />foreign concept, you know?
2756879 2759177 I know you love to just<br />run in, making shit up.
2759298 2760971 But like any professional,<br />i have a plan.
2761133 2762931 So let's just<br />stick to it, okay?
2763094 2764562 Just move your plan along.
2765137 2766855 All right, yuri, come on. Let's<br />grab the key, get out of here.
2767014 2768436 Yes.
2769141 2770893 Just take a moment.
2789370 2790371 How you doing?
2792999 2794501 Fine.
2804427 2806225 How did you get<br />over here so quick?
2809598 2810770 Well...
2811684 2814483 I took garden ring.
2814729 2818905 Oh, the garden ring. Supposed<br />to always be bad, right?
2829035 2830161 Hey, john.
2830453 2831613 Did you get stuck in traffic?
2833914 2836212 I have it! I have it.
2839503 2841426 Welcome, americans.
2847970 2849813 Put your goddamn<br />guns down, asshole!
2858522 2860490 Papa, what is going on?
2864070 2865697 Give me your weapons.
2866489 2867741 Come and get them.
2874121 2875338 Really?
2876499 2877671 Really.
2880419 2881545 Papa.
2884090 2885307 Yuri.
2885466 2886718 Do it.
2888886 2890684 I thought you were<br />a problem child.
2909073 2911701 This a part of your plan,<br />mr. Professional?
2914745 2915871 What are you doing?
2916580 2918048 It's about money, papa...
2918624 2920126 ...Millions of dollars.
2920501 2921798 You think life was easy for me?
2921877 2923800 While you were sitting in prison being a victim?
2924964 2926136 But.
2926298 2928642 I'm your father.
2930636 2932229 And i am your daughter.
2935683 2937936 We should kill the old man now.
2938102 2939445 We still need him.
2939854 2941197 But then you can kill.
2941647 2943194 Thank you.
2946444 2947491 Hi.
2949196 2951324 I don't know if i'm<br />saying this right.
2952825 2953826 Hi.
2956203 2959878 Do you know what i hate<br />about the americans?
2961167 2962293 Everything.
2963711 2965884 Especially cowboys.
2998496 3002342 I could have been a dancer.<br />I swear to god.
3007087 3009556 But nobody supported me.
3014094 3015095 You two
3017598 3020101 Have been such a
3020309 3023404 Pain in the ass!
3034448 3035449 Come on, come on!
3041288 3043131 I prefer dancing, really.
3043874 3048721 But killing is much, much better<br />than working in a grocery shop!
3053133 3054134 Jesus christ!
3056845 3057846 Nice one.
3071193 3073867 You guys. So arrogant.
3074363 3076331 It's not 1986, you know.
3078534 3080332 Reagan is dead.
3087876 3090629 Sorry. Oh, god.
3100514 3101891 What's funny there?
3102725 3103726 Can't tell you.
3104685 3107188 It's not you.<br />I love these outfits.
3108355 3110528 You guys are looking good.
3118782 3120876 That was enough, thank you.
3124163 3125210 Let's dance.
3142931 3143932 Come on! Come on!
3156320 3157412 Jack!
3158280 3161033 Remember the last time we talked<br />just before you went away?
3162493 3164166 Oh, no! No, no!
3164328 3166797 You're not gonna open up<br />to me right before we die!
3168540 3170213 No,<br />that's not your thing, john.
3170376 3171502 What's my thing?
3171669 3173967 Fucking killing bad guys,<br />that's your thing!
3175589 3177307 You're not gonna die today!
3204702 3206454 Go!
3238652 3239904 Shit!
3240654 3241655 Fuck.
3242906 3244374 We're finished, john.
3254793 3256841 I'm taking care of it now.
3267681 3269228 I can't believe this.
3276148 3278367 I can't believe this.<br />This is unbelievable.
3286658 3288831 Jack. Hey!
3296877 3297878 Jesus!
3301632 3302633 Come on!
3310516 3311756 Let's get out of this building!
3327699 3328325 Where are they?
3334414 3335415 Come on.
3360274 3361901 Alik, that's it. We're done!
3361984 3362610 Let's go!
3362818 3363489 Break left!
3363777 3364528 Copy, commander.
3398896 3399818 Do you have him?
3399980 3401402 Yes.
3401565 3402361 And the file?
3402649 3404242 Does he have it?
3404818 3407037 I need that file, alik.
3407195 3408742 He's taking us to it.
3410157 3412580 No more mistakes, alik.
3413201 3414874 And when you have the file...
3415662 3417414 ...Kill them both.
3418999 3420000 Yes, sir.
3438226 3439352 Shit.
3443857 3446201 That was exciting.
3446360 3448863 Yeah. Loads of fun.
3450072 3452040 You wanna go again?
3455202 3456374 Are you shot?
3456536 3457537 No.
3458038 3459210 No, i'm fine.
3460040 3461587 Let me take a look at that.
3461750 3463548 It's fine.
3464419 3465887 Oh, fuck.
3466046 3469300 I can't believe she betrayed<br />her father for chagarin.
3470717 3472890 I don't understand that.
3474763 3476891 Someday you will.
3477724 3479146 Kids.
3482562 3484781 What's our next move?
3485440 3487568 I don't know.
3487985 3489908 You don't know?<br />I don't know, all right?
3490112 3492160 I mean, i'm out of moves.<br />I don't know.
3492614 3494082 I don't know.
3495575 3497077 I screwed up.
3497995 3499588 I blew the mission.
3507129 3509257 Well, then we're done, right?
3509423 3510595 Yeah, we're done.
3510716 3511842 We're done.

3535532 3537626 What the hell are we gonna do?
3538493 3540621 What's in the file?
3540787 3543336 Evidence on chagarin.
3547127 3548674 Evidence about what?

3554468 3556061 Look, listen to me.
3556219 3558221 Komarov and<br />chagarin used to have this
3558388 3562814 Nasty little side-Racket<br />going on back in the day.
3564853 3568027 They siphoned weapons-Grade<br />uranium, got greedy,
3568648 3571071 Caused the meltdown.
3572652 3575826 Then, you know, they fell out.
3576031 3578659 Former partners, bad break-Up.
3580160 3581878 Scumbags.
3582996 3584748 So, chagarin had<br />komarov thrown in jail.
3584915 3587589 You know, put him in a hole,<br />forget about him.

3600847 3605068 Listen, chagarin is bad news.<br />He's the real deal.
3605227 3608948 If we see this guy in control, we're<br />gonna see the whole thing fall apart.
3609106 3612280 I'm talking terrorism,
3612442 3614285 Wmds,
3614903 3616280 Nukes.

3818398 3820196 When you set south philly<br />on fire, you mean?
3823903 3826584 We had to take out a second mortgage<br />on the house to make your bail.
3826614 3828742 Yeah, i'm sorry about that.
3829576 3830919 It was funny.

3855935 3857937 It's not the chernobyl<br />in switzerland, right?
3858104 3861278 With all the skiing and<br />the snow and everything?
3861441 3863443 You mean grenoble?

3976347 3978600 Get moving, old goat.
4013259 4016763 Couple of fresh coats of paint and<br />a weedwacker and it's good to go.
4024938 4027782 You know, at first, they<br />denied anything even happened.
4027941 4030535 Held a children's parade<br />the next day to prove it.
4031027 4035123 24 hours later, 50,000<br />residents were evacuated.
4035990 4037958 Never came back.
4039661 4042835 As soon as they get in that<br />vault, komarov's a dead man.
4045458 4047005 All right.
4097552 4099395 You got a plan?
4100513 4101685 Not really.

5679132 5681260 Do you go looking for trouble
5681426 5683554 Or does it always<br />just seem to find you?
5685638 5688608 You know,<br />after all these years,
5689475 5692228 I still ask myself<br />the same question.
5731226 5735356 I had a dream last night<br />that i was piloting a plane
5735521 5739025 And all the passengers<br />were drunk and insane
5739150 5742370 I crash landed<br />in a louisiana swamp
5742445 5745995 Shot up a horde of zombies<br />but i come out on top
5746074 5748202 What's it all about?
5748326 5751626 Guess it just reflects my mood
5753581 5757256 Sitting in the dirt<br />feeling kind of hurt
5757335 5762842 All i hear is doom and gloom
5764342 5768597 And all is darkness
5768680 5770808 In my room
5771849 5777356 Through the light,<br />your face i see
5779065 5784117 Baby, take a chance baby,<br />won't you dance with me
5786447 5789701 Lost all that treasure<br />in an overseas war
5789784 5793630 It just goes to show you<br />don't get what you paid for
5793746 5797125 Battle to the rich<br />and you worry about the poor
5797208 5801088 Put my feet up on the couch<br />and lock all the doors
5801170 5802547 What's that funky noise?
5802880 5806601 It's the tightening<br />of the screws
5807969 5811769 Sitting in the dirt<br />feeling kind of hurt
5811973 5817355 All i hear is doom and gloom
5819355 5822199 But when those drums
5822275 5825154 Go boom, boom, boom
5826362 5829536 Through the night
5829615 5833165 Your face i see
5833536 5839384 Baby, take a chance baby,<br />won't you dance with me
5841669 5842670 Yeah!
5842962 5847308 Baby, won't you dance with me
5847383 5849101 Ah, yeah
5869447 5873668 Fracking deep for oil but<br />there's nothing in the sump
5873743 5877373 There's kids all picking<br />at the garbage dump
5877455 5881050 I am running out of water<br />so i better prime the pump
5881125 5885301 I am trying to stay sober<br />but i end up drunk
5885380 5890136 We'll be eating dirt living<br />on the side of the road
5892303 5894146 There's some food for thought
5894222 5897977 Kind of makes your head explode
5899727 5901445 Feeling kind of hurt
5902105 5903277 Yeah!
5903356 5906360 But all i hear
5906484 5909283 Is doom and gloom
5910405 5914751 And all is darkness
5914826 5917170 In my room
5917703 5920832 Through the night
5920915 5924135 Your face i see
5925461 5927714 Baby, take a chance
5928297 5931517 Won't you dance with me
5931926 5933223 Yeah!
5933594 5934595 Come on!
5935096 5937849 Baby, won't you dance with me
5939684 5941778 I'm feeling kind of hurt
5941853 5944857 Baby, won't you dance with me
5945606 5947324 Oh, yeah!
5947400 5949118 Sitting in the dirt
5949193 5953198 Baby, won't you dance with me
