80122 81456 What do you want Viktor?
94636 96345 Why are you doing this?
97890 99682 What do you want to accomplish tomorrow?
101685 103895 I'm prepared to pay for my sins.
107357 110193 You should prepare yourself too.
111904 112904 Yuri,
114323 118493 let's be civil about this. We were friends once...
119495 121370 ...we could be again.
123248 124832 Just give me the file...
126043 129879 ...and I'll hand your life back to you.
132257 135009 Forget this stupid trial.
137513 139222 I don't want my life back.
146647 152777 You think I'm going to let you talk tomorrow?
155364 157573 No one is going to hear you!
158575 161202 I own everybody in that courtroom.
163288 164455 You don't own me.
177052 178261 Mike.
179304 181639 Chagarin's making a move on Komarov.
182266 183975 Shit. I'll see if we got local.
253211 254712 We are ready to get started.
255297 256339 Make the call.
262346 264805 You won't disappoint me?
270520 272688 Have I ever disappointed you?
278070 279070 Anton.
281365 283366 Alik, it's Viktor.
283825 286410 Yuri Komarov says hello...
287496 288704 It's time to grab him.
289706 290706 Yuri Komarov?
292250 293250 ...and GOODBYE.
317401 319235 McClane.
321071 322905 Hey, Murph, how you doing?
323073 325157 Nice grouping, Grandpa.
326576 329203 Yeah, not bad.
331081 333082 Is that it?
333917 336711 Yep. We found him.
337337 339505 It's not good, John.
340841 342842 Hospital or morgue?
344094 345761 Worse.
347389 350224 When was the last time you spoke to this kid?
351810 353561 It's been a while.
355021 357273 Maybe a few years, even.
359192 362445 Last time I saw him, it was pretty ugly.
365115 367491 Well, there's a few different versions in there,
367659 372371 but my people are pretty sure he's<br />being held at a Moscow prison
372539 374874 awaiting sentencing.
375041 376834 What's he charged with?
377002 378210 It's a nasty sheet.
380839 383424 He'll be lucky to get life.
387012 389764 He can never get out of his own way.
391308 393517 He had a lot of problems.
395937 397813 He's still my kid.
399316 401025 I know.
401193 405571 But it's Russia. They do things differently over there.
408241 409742 Me, too.
412788 413913 Good luck, Poppy.
413997 414997 Thanks, kid.

454454 456330 McClane, good luck.
456414 457414 See you soon.
539164 541916 I was told you had something to offer me?
545045 547504 You're looking for evidence against Yuri Komarov?
550967 552301 Perhaps.
556932 559099 Put me in the courtroom with him...
559768 562811 ...and I'll testify that Komarov hired me<br />to murder Anton.
563104 564188 Did he?
565315 566982 I'll testify under oath.
568860 570861 That's good enough, isn't it?
614614 616532 ...Draganskiy courthouse?
616700 618117 You speak Russian?
619285 620953 How did I do?
621121 624540 Well, you asked for a large bag of hair
624708 627209 on the way to Taganskaya courthouse.
628211 630629 But I got it. I got it.
630797 632214 Good.
633633 635384 Traffic sucks here,too, huh?
635468 636510 Sex?
637554 639680 You want sex? Sexy clubs?
639889 641849 No. No sex.
642225 643851 It sucks, this traffic.
644394 645811 What is it? An accident?
646020 647521 No.
647856 649732 Garden Ring. Is bad.

1325074 1327575 No, sir, Moscow police will have shut down<br />the Garden Ring.

1917416 1919501 I swear to God, I will put<br />a bullet in you this time.
1919501 1921001 Who do you think<br />you're talking to?
1921169 1922545 The last person I want to see.
1922963 1924464 Well, maybe you missed the whole part back there
1924464 1926340 where I saved you and Papa Geppetto here
1926508 1928384 from a whole bunch of Russian bad guys.
1928552 1930553 You saved? You saved?
1930720 1932096 That's right, saved.
1933265 1934723 Shut up. Shut up.

1936685 1939145 I'm a screw-up?<br />I'm a screw-up?
1939312 1940312 I'm still your father.
1940397 1942022 Yeah, nothing I can do about that.

1951867 1953284 We will begin immediately.
1953368 1955286 Excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped.
1956246 1958289 I'll call you back. There is a problem with Komarov.
1958373 1959373 What happened?
1959708 1961268 Some sort of attack on the courthouse.
1961543 1962626 Who took him?
1962711 1963711 They don't know yet.
1964171 1965546 What do you mean you don't know?
1965964 1966780 Eh...
1966798 1968257 ...well it's confusing...
1968758 1971302 Eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov...
1972554 1974013 ...with an American.
1975515 1977475 What American?
1980395 1982438 John McClane.
1984774 1985983 Let's go.

1994075 1996368 Look, Mike, we had an unexpected delay.<br />I'm sorry.
1996453 1997495 I understand.
1997579 1999788 This is the last guy on eartHi expected to see.
1999956 2002317 Listen to me, Yuri, you have<br />half of Moscow looking for you.
2002417 2004126 I need you to get dressed.<br />Why am I here?
2004294 2007004 Please put on these clothes. Trust me.
2007172 2009298 This is the key to your cuffs. Take these.
2009466 2010716 Oh, my Jesus.
2010884 2012343 Are you okay? What?
2012511 2014929 Do you have the file on Chagarin?
2016640 2018390 This is what you been doing, Jack?
2019142 2020226 Spy shit?
2022646 2024104 This is it?
2024272 2027233 You're a spy? Oh, my God.
2029611 2032780 The 007 of Plainfield, New Jersey.
2033406 2034615 Very nice.
2034783 2036825 McClane, shut up.
2037202 2038702 Take it easy, Oddjob.
2038870 2040704 I'm on vacation.
2040872 2042206 Your mom will be pleased.
2042374 2044174 We thought you were<br />doing drugs or something.
2044334 2045376 Mr. Komarov.
2045502 2048087 Or selling drugs, but that was me, really.
2048797 2051465 Do you have the file on Chagarin?
2051883 2053592 Yes, or no?
2055512 2056845 It's very simple, Yuri.
2056972 2059223 You give me the file,<br />and I get you out of Russia.
2059933 2062810 And you're a free man.<br />What do you say?
2065522 2068941 It's not about me.<br />I don't care about my life.
2070569 2071652 Well, that's the deal.
2071820 2073112 It's the only deal.
2074114 2076115 Come on.
2077117 2079827 Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
2080662 2082037 What's it gonna be?
2083790 2085916 Yes or no?
2086084 2088877 The clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on.
2090046 2091922 You will get me out of here?
2092090 2093173 Only the three of you?
2093341 2095551 Whoa, Nijinsky. I'm not in the gang.
2095719 2098012 I just got off the plane. I'm still jet-lagged.
2098179 2101056 I'm not involved in this. Huh, Jack?
2103810 2106270 Only if I can take my daughter with me.
2109733 2111859 Chagarin's people will kill her.
2114195 2116322 Fine. Make it quick.
2117532 2118532 Ah.
2118617 2119992 Where's the file?
2121036 2123912 It's in a vault in Prypiat, but<br />the key is here in Moscow.
2124080 2125205 At Hotel Ukraina.
2126666 2127666 Shit.
2128835 2132671 Make your call. We're going to the Ukraina, let's go.
2140764 2141764 It's papa...
2143683 2144850 I'm fine, Sunshine...
2145685 2146685 ...we 'll talk later.
2147228 2148228 Listen.
2148855 2151555 I'll be waiting for you<br />where your mother and I shared our first dance.
2151566 2152566 Now.
2154361 2155819 Hurry! Hurry! You understand?
2166122 2168957 Mike, listen, I'm sorry about this morning, man.
2170502 2172670 It's fine.
2173713 2176173 Okay, let's go.
2180679 2181679 Contact!
2184724 2186266 Down! Get down!
2186518 2188102 Go! Get down! Go, go, go!
2191606 2192898 John, cover!
2208623 2209623 Come on, buddy!
2212085 2214044 Go! Go!
2220677 2222386 That's right, jerk-off!
2222470 2223637 All right, let's move, John!
2223805 2225180 I'm on fucking vacation!
2225348 2227224 Come on, time to hustle.<br />Watch your head.
2229269 2230269 McClane, move it.
2230437 2232312 8, 000 fucking miles for this?
2237402 2239153 Get down, Yuri. Stay low!
2239404 2240529 Head down.
2240655 2242406 Come on. Go, go!
2256379 2257755 Safe house, my ass.
2263678 2264736 He knows how old we are, no?
2264763 2265763 Come on.
2270935 2271935 Here, here, here.
2272187 2274271 Sit down. You're all right.
2274439 2275689 Let me look at you.
2276274 2277608 It's all right. You're fine.
2277776 2279193 What are you doing?
2280695 2281695 Jack.
2281780 2283782 Calm down, Yuri, okay?<br />You're gonna be just fine.
2283782 2286575 Here, put this on, stay warm.
2288536 2291205 What was that, John?<br />Five minutes? Five minutes?
2291372 2293081 You blew a three-year op in five minutes!
2293249 2294929 You're welcome!<br />What do you want me to do?
2296920 2299129 Unbelievable.
2299297 2302382 I'm so fucking burned.<br />I got no friends in this town anymore.
2302550 2305385 What about your people at Langley?<br />Just give them a call.
2305553 2307805 Give me your phone.
2315563 2317731 It's a two-year contract on that phone.
2317899 2320067 What are you carrying?<br />Give me that.
2322070 2323695 All right.<br />You got any cash on you?
2324781 2326365 Some American money.
2326533 2328951 What are you talking about?<br />We need to keep on moving.
2329410 2332746 We have to get this guy to a doctor.<br />To medical attention, Jack.
2332914 2333914 The mission stands.
2334123 2336458 Your mission is bleeding out over there.
2336626 2338752 The mission continues.<br />We go to the hotel.
2342590 2346134 Come on, let's move.<br />Let's move.
2357772 2358939 This is nuts.
2359232 2360977 What, are you going to go out and<br />kill somebody else now?
2360984 2362734 Why all this trouble for just one guy?
2362944 2364653 He's a political prisoner.
2365238 2366321 Not that you care, John,
2366489 2368782 but it's a matter of national security, all right?
2368950 2372411 He's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin,<br />and we need that to happen.
2372579 2373620 Well, great, Jack.
2373788 2375810 Let's drop him off at the Embassy, and we can go home.
2375832 2378333 Are you kidding me?<br />After what happened at the safe house?
2379669 2381070 Look, it doesn't work like that, all right?
2381170 2383220 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and I'm a burnable asset.
2383339 2386133 So, I now need that file to un-fuck this mission.
2386342 2387426 Any more questions?
2387594 2389011 Yeah, just one.
2389178 2391305 How come you never called and told me where you were?
2391973 2393473 Like you'd give a shit.
2411743 2412784 Shit.
2413328 2415120 Well, we're not going in the front door.
2425256 2427257 All right, hold up, hold up.
2431054 2434348 Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right?<br />We're almost done.
2434891 2437017 As soon as we get that key,<br />we're gonna grab the file,
2437226 2439327 get you and your daughter out of Russia, all right?
2439395 2440687 All right.
2442023 2445859 Listen to me, you're doing good.<br />All right?
2446027 2448437 I need you to hang here a second.<br />Keep an eye on him, John.
2448446 2449571 Hey, hey.
2449739 2453367 What is it with all this "John" shit?<br />Whatever happened to "Dad?"
2454035 2455702 Good question.
2458873 2461583 In Russia, we have word for men like him.
2462377 2463877 "Krutoi."
2464796 2467965 It means "tough", "hard".
2468132 2471468 In America, it means "juvenile delinquent".
2473554 2475639 Is he your only child?
2477225 2480060 No. I got a daughter, too.
2480895 2483105 You?
2485984 2488819 I have only my Solnyschka <i>(Sunshine)</i>.
2489570 2492990 When she was little, I was working all the time.
2493908 2496910 I believed work was all that mattered.
2502333 2504835 I screwed my kid's life up, too.
2505086 2506086 You work all the time
2506170 2509089 around the clock most of the time, when you're a cop.
2509507 2514928 I just thought that working all the<br />time was a good thing, you know?
2520935 2522436 I didn't help him at all.
2525523 2527441 It's never too late,
2528776 2529943 I hope.
2532947 2534781 Okay, let's go.
2544459 2546959 All right, Yuri,<br />which part of the building is the ballroom in?
2546961 2547961 Main tower.
2548129 2549671 Main tower. Which floor?
2549797 2552466 Top floor.
2552592 2553592 What about security?
2553676 2555676 You remember any guards?<br />Cameras? Anything like that?
2555678 2557554 I don't know.
2557722 2559222 Well, I need you to remember.
2559390 2561391 I was in prison for five years, how should I know?
2561642 2563351 Everything could have changed.<br />I know.
2563519 2566188 Just think, all right?<br />Picture it in your head.
2567023 2568982 The ballroom was closed in '89.
2569150 2571151 I think it's under construction now.
2571486 2572903 So that floor's unsecured.
2573071 2575363 I don't know! Listen!<br />My daughter is in there.
2575448 2576698 I'm scared to death, let's go!
2576783 2578325 Just calm down, Yuri.
2603893 2605936 I guess you have done that before.
2608564 2609898 Smart.
2612735 2614778 I could have done it.
2657572 2658572 Irina?
2675673 2676798 Papa.
2680761 2682262 Irina. Papa!
2685141 2687142 That's tender.
2687768 2689686 Really? I wouldn't know.
2700156 2701615 Need a hug?
2704285 2706536 We're not really a hugging family.
2706704 2708288 That's right.
2710041 2711499 We just have to get one thing...
2712376 2714294 ...and then we 're leaving Moscow for good.
2715129 2716129 OK?
2716130 2717130 OK.
2724555 2725555 Who are they?
2728726 2730518 The young one works for CIA.
2731395 2734147 The old one is his father.<br />Americans.
2735983 2737150 Then thank God for them.
2739320 2741488 There's something no good about this.
2741656 2743031 Just shut up, all right?
2744825 2745909 I'm telling you, Jack,
2746827 2748328 this smells bad.
2750331 2751998 Just stop, okay?
2752333 2756711 This might seem like a totally foreign concept,<br />you know?
2756879 2759172 I know you love to just run in, making shit up.
2759298 2760978 But like any professional, I have a plan.
2761133 2762926 So let's just stick to it, okay?
2763094 2764552 Just move your plan along.
2765137 2767007 All right, Yuri, come on.<br />Let's grab the key, get out of here.
2767014 2768431 Yes.
2769141 2770892 Just take a moment.
2789370 2790370 How you doing?
2792999 2794499 Fine.
2804427 2806219 How did you get over here so quick?
2809598 2810765 Well...
2811684 2814477 I took Garden Ring.
2814729 2818898 Oh, the Garden Ring.<br />Supposed to always be bad, right?
2829035 2830160 Hey, John.
2830453 2831613 Did you get stuck in traffic?
2833914 2836207 I have it! I have it.
2839503 2841421 Welcome, Americans.
2847970 2849804 Put your goddamn guns down, asshole!
2858522 2860482 Papa, what is going on?
2864070 2865695 Give me your weapons.
2866489 2867739 Come and get them.
2874121 2875330 Really?
2876499 2877665 Really.
2880419 2881544 Papa.
2884090 2885298 Yuri.
2885466 2886716 Do it.
2888886 2890678 I thought you were a problem child.
2909073 2911699 This a part of your plan, Mr. Professional?
2914745 2915870 What are you doing?
2916580 2918039 It's about money, papa...
2918624 2920125 ...millions of dollars.
2920501 2921793 You think life was easy for me?
2921877 2923797 While you were sitting in prison being a victim?
2924964 2926131 But,
2926298 2928633 I'm your father.
2930636 2932220 And I am your daughter.
2935683 2937934 We should kill the old man now.
2938102 2939435 We still need him.
2939854 2941187 But them you can kill.
2941647 2943189 Thank you.
2946443 2947485 Hi.
2949196 2951322 I don't know if I'm saying this right.
2952825 2953825 Hi.
2956203 2959873 Do you know what I hate about the Americans?
2961167 2962292 Everything.
2963711 2965879 Especially cowboys.
2998495 3002332 I could have been a dancer.<br />I swear to God.
3007087 3009547 But nobody supported me.
3014094 3015094 You two
3017598 3020099 have been such a
3020309 3023394 pain in the ass!
3034448 3035448 Come on, come on!
3041288 3043122 I prefer dancing, really.
3043874 3048711 But killing is much, much better than<br />working in a grocery shop!
3053133 3054133 Jesus Christ!
3056845 3057845 Nice one.
3071193 3073861 You guys. So arrogant.
3074363 3076322 It's not 1 986, you know.
3078534 3080326 Reagan is dead.
3087876 3090628 Sorry. Oh, God.
3100514 3101889 What's funny there?
3102725 3103725 Can't tell you.
3104685 3107186 It's not you. I love these outfits.
3108355 3110523 You guys are looking good.
3118782 3120867 That was enough, thank you.
3124163 3125204 Let's dance.
3142931 3143931 Come on! Come on!
3156320 3157403 Jack!
3158280 3161032 Remember the last time we talked<br />just before you went away?
3162493 3164160 Oh, no! No, no!
3164328 3166788 You're not gonna open up<br />to me right before we die!
3168540 3170208 No, that's not your thing, John.
3170376 3171501 What's my thing?
3171668 3173961 Fucking killing bad guys, that's your thing!
3175589 3177298 You're not gonna die today!
3204701 3206452 Go!
3238652 3239902 Shit!
3240654 3241654 Fuck.
3242906 3244365 We're finished, John.
3254793 3256836 I'm taking care of it now.
3267681 3269223 I can't believe this.
3276148 3278357 I can't believe this.<br />This is unbelievable.
3286658 3288826 Jack. Hey!
3296877 3297877 Jesus!
3301632 3302632 Come on!
3310515 3311755 Let's get out of this building!
3327699 3328699 Where are they?
3334414 3335414 Come on.
3360274 3361899 Alik, that's it. We 're done!
3361984 3362808 Let's go!
3362818 3363684 Break left!
3363777 3364777 Copy, Commander.
3398895 3399812 Do you have him?
3399980 3401397 Yes.
3401565 3402556 And the file?
3402649 3404233 Does he have it?
3404818 3407028 I need that file, Alik.
3407195 3408738 He's taking us to it.
3410157 3412575 No more mistakes, Alik.
3413201 3414869 And when you have the file...
3415662 3417413 ...kill them both.
3418999 3419999 Yes, sir.
3438226 3439352 Shit.
3443857 3446192 That was exciting.
3446360 3448861 Yeah. Loads of fun.
3450072 3452031 You wanna go again?
3455202 3456369 Are you shot?
3456536 3457536 No.
3458038 3459205 No, I'm fine.
3460040 3461582 Let me take a look at that.
3461750 3463542 It's fine.
3464419 3465878 Oh, fuck.
3466046 3469298 I can't believe she betrayed<br />her father for Chagarin.
3470717 3472885 I don't understand that.
3474763 3476889 Someday you will.
3477724 3479141 Kids.
3482562 3484772 What's our next move?
3485440 3487566 I don't know.
3487984 3489902 You don't know?<br />I don't know, all right?
3490112 3492154 I mean, I'm out of moves.<br />I don't know.
3492614 3494073 I don't know.
3495575 3497076 I screwed up.
3497994 3499578 I blew the mission.
3507129 3509255 Well, then we're done, right?
3509423 3510589 Yeah, we're done.
3510715 3511841 We're done.
3512008 3514260 We should just go home.
3514428 3517012 We'll stop by a little pharmacy<br />on our way out of Moscow,
3517180 3520766 get you some Merthiolate or mercury
3520934 3522776 and fix up your little scratches, here.
3522853 3525771 Get you home.<br />Get a little toy set.
3526273 3529692 Get yourself a nice warm glass of milk<br />with a little Bosco in it.
3529860 3531444 Get your CIA slippers.
3531611 3532778 All right.
3532946 3534613 What? I get it.
3535532 3537616 What the hell are we gonna do?
3538493 3540619 What's in the file?
3540787 3543330 Evidence on Chagarin.
3547127 3548669 Evidence about what?
3549463 3551797 Chernobyl.
3554468 3556051 Look, listen to me.
3556219 3558220 Komarov and Chagarin used to have this
3558388 3562808 nasty little side-racket going on back in the day.
3564853 3568022 They siphoned weapons-grade uranium, got greedy,
3568648 3571066 caused the meltdown.
3572652 3575821 Then, you know, they fell out.
3576031 3578657 Former partners, bad break-up.
3580160 3581869 Scumbags.
3582996 3584747 So, Chagarin had Komarov thrown in jail.
3584915 3587583 You know, put him in a hole, forget about him.
3587751 3589668 Doesn't have to worry anymore.
3591171 3593380 So what happened to rescuesque?
3594007 3596175 Well, he grew a conscience.
3598053 3600679 Yeah, well, that figures.
3600847 3605059 Listen, Chagarin is bad news.<br />He's the real deal.
3605227 3608938 If we see this guy in control,<br />we're gonna see the whole thing fall apart.
3609105 3612274 I'm talking terrorism,
3612442 3614276 WMDs,
3614903 3616278 nukes.
3620116 3622576 Someone has to stop him.
3623870 3626747 Well, that's what we do.
3628542 3633128 We go out to Chiapep and we do our thing.
3634798 3636382 Our thing?
3636466 3637466 Yeah.
3638802 3641262 We go out there and kill a lot of scumbags.
3647894 3650312 What? You got something better to do?
3650480 3653440 All right. Pull it.
3653984 3655693 You're not gonna cry, are you?
3655860 3657695 Just pull it.
3657862 3659905 Everybody needs a good cry once in a while, Jack.
3660407 3662116 Don't be ashamed. Pull it.
3662367 3663909 You remember that time when
3664077 3668205 you and Ralphie Mauser<br />were gonna have that house-painting job?
3668373 3669823 Got your finger caught in the ladder,
3669833 3671208 you cried for about five, six days.
3671376 3672668 John, just pull it!
3673086 3675254 All right.
3675422 3677381 On three. Here you go.
3677716 3679592 One, two...
3684598 3685764 Good God.
3685932 3687516 Jesus.
3689352 3691395 When was the last time<br />you had a tetanus shot?
3696985 3698444 You all right?
3698611 3699737 Yeah.
3701156 3702656 We need a car.
3703325 3704825 Atta boy.
3704993 3706452 Back to work.
3726139 3728932 Hey, Watergate, how's that lock coming?
3729100 3730684 Almost there.
3730852 3732644 Here, try these.
3733897 3735064 Come on.
3735231 3737649 Oh, stealing. That's nice.<br />Real nice, John.
3737942 3740486 Yeah, I'm up for the Father of the Year award.
3752749 3753791 Whoa.
3756336 3757795 All right.
3758004 3760031 How'd you know all of these<br />guns were gonna be here?
3760131 3762132 It's a Chechen hangout.
3762300 3764051 Owner doesn't like guns in the club,
3764177 3766011 so these bozos leave them in their cars.
3766429 3768263 You learn a lot in three years.
3768348 3769348 Yeah.
3785407 3786865 You sleeping?
3789702 3790869 I was.
3792872 3794123 Jet-lag.
3800922 3804425 Jeez, when was the last time<br />we were in a car together?
3807053 3809054 Drive home from Trenton.
3810098 3813100 I had to bail you out for that weapons charge.
3813643 3814643 Yeah?
3815812 3818188 No, it was the fire thing, right?
3818398 3820190 When you set South Philly on fire, you mean?
3823903 3826600 We had to take out a second mortgage<br />on the house to make your bail.
3826614 3828740 Yeah, I'm sorry about that.
3829576 3830909 It was funny.
3843298 3845591 Are we really going to Chernobyl?
3846134 3847634 Yeah.
3848761 3850095 The Chernobyl.
3851097 3852431 The radioactive joint?<br />Meltdown?
3852599 3854266 That's the one.
3855935 3857936 It's not the Chernobyl in Switzerland, right?
3858104 3861273 With all the skiing and the snow and everything?
3861441 3863442 You mean Grenoble?
3864777 3867821 No, sorry, we're not going to Grenoble.
3874787 3877289 Eddie Collins's kid took him on vacation last year.
3877457 3878790 They went down to Boca.
3878958 3879958 Oh, yeah?
3880126 3881326 Spent four days at the track.
3881336 3883003 Well, that's nice.
3883379 3885047 That's relaxing.
3885215 3887716 Oh, yeah. Sure.
3889052 3891136 We have to go to Chernobyl?
3891304 3893138 Yeah, sorry about that.
3893640 3896517 But all the radioactive stuff is out, right?
3932554 3934388 Is it as you remember, papa?
3935014 3936181 I don't want to remember.
3938309 3939309 Tough.
3941729 3942729 The file...
3943189 3944356 ...is in the inner vault.
3947110 3949736 Very touching.<br />Let's move.
3974178 3975679 Which one is it?
3976347 3978599 Get moving, old goat.
4013259 4016762 Couple of fresh coats of paint and<br />a weedwacker and it's good to go.
4024937 4027773 You know, at first, they denied anything even happened.
4027940 4030525 Held a children's parade the next day to prove it.
4031027 4035113 24 hours later, 50, 000 residents were evacuated.
4035990 4037949 Never came back.
4039661 4042829 As soon as they get in that<br />vault, Komarov's a dead man.
4045458 4047000 All right.
4097552 4099386 You got a plan?
4100513 4101680 Not really.
4102890 4105016 I kind of thought we'd just wing it.
4105184 4109729 You know, run in, guns blazing,<br />making shit up as we go.
4110857 4112107 Yeah? Yeah.
4116112 4117571 What is this? A pirate gun?
4117738 4120240 Yeah. It's old school, man.
4120533 4121533 Like you, right?
4121951 4123577 Yeah, like me.
4126539 4129374 One of these days, I'm gonna<br />have a long talk with you.
4146100 4147642 Look, Jack,
4148728 4150896 I'm sorry your partner got killed.
4152899 4156902 I'm sorry I fucked up your day.<br />That wasn't my plan.
4158237 4160238 I caused you problems.
4160406 4163783 You know, I came here for something else.
4167580 4170582 And all that other bullshit. I mean,
4174337 4176129 I had a pretty good day.
4178591 4181468 It's fun, running around with you.
4187433 4189100 It's good to see you.
4195191 4197609 I love you, boy.
4203324 4204783 You, too.
4207036 4209204 I want you to know I got your back.
4212875 4214876 I got yours, too.
4219298 4222634 All right. Let's go kill some motherfuckers.
4244490 4245490 Key.
4335831 4338541 Okay, what the fuck is this?
4339043 4342420 I'm losing my patience.<br />The fucking file better be here.
4347093 4349678 Radiation has been pooling in this room for decades.
4352556 4354766 You've underestimated us, Daddy dearest.
4355351 4358395 Bring it in!
4410823 4412323 Atta boy.
4417997 4418997 Come on! Come on!
4419707 4424961 Compound 27-4. It neutralizes radiation, trust me.
4464376 4468087 All clear.<br />We can ditch the suits.
4505501 4508336 The hell is that?
4510089 4513716 One billion euros worth of enriched uranium.
4515261 4516761 What?
4517972 4521015 Don't worry, it's stable in this form.
4521100 4522141 File!
4524144 4527981 Irina, cut the crap, please.
4528440 4531859 No one here is speaking about uranium.<br />Where's the file?
4533070 4535405 No more games, where is the file?
4540995 4543705 That's no longer your concern.
4568731 4569731 Sunshine...
4570441 4571482 ...you did well.
4575362 4576571 I told you...
4577364 4578684 ...everything would work out.
4581660 4582660 Come to papa.
4596342 4597425 Pap, you're a genius.
4599011 4600011 I know.
4604892 4605892 Load it up.
4608937 4609937 Pegasus?
4610481 4611481 Do you copy?
4660114 4662490 A lot of hardware for a file.
4671792 4673042 Wheels up in five minutes.
4674002 4675002 Perfect.
4716003 4717003 Here you go, sir.
4717337 4719338 Team extraction completed. She's all yours.
4719840 4720840 Good.
4750871 4752205 Are you inside?
4752831 4753831 Yes, yes, Viktor.
4756084 4757335 I'm inside.
4760214 4761255 Yuri?
4762841 4763841 You surprised?
4766011 4768429 I'm in the same place where it all started...
4769348 4770932 ...before you betrayed me.
4771850 4772850 Remember...
4774561 4777063 ...you promised to give me my life back.
4778357 4779565 You gave it back to me.
4781360 4782360 I thank you for that.
4784738 4786030 And now...
4786740 4788074 ...I'm going to take yours.
4818272 4819856 Static 4, we are ready for take off.
4822067 4824402 Static 4, do you copy?
4829575 4831033 Yuri!
4834705 4836122 Yuri.
4836290 4838457 Where's the dancer?
4838917 4841252 You okay? You hurt?
4841420 4842920 No.
4845799 4846799 I'm good.
4850596 4852096 I'm all right.
4856810 4859228 What's in these boxes?
4862316 4864233 Thank God you're here, Jack.
4865444 4866777 We have to leave.
4867070 4868446 They're coming back any minute.
4871158 4873659 Just let me get the file.
4873952 4875494 What's in the boxes?
4878999 4881250 It's U-235.
4883128 4885338 Weapons-grade uranium.
4887299 4889300 Armored cases.
4894973 4896349 The bomb kind?
4898143 4900478 Yeah, the bomb kind.
4906318 4907777 Not so fast, Eddie.
4907986 4909153 Are you crazy?
4910155 4911656 Yeah, a little bit.
4911823 4913157 I'm getting the file.
4914493 4917328 No. No, you're not.
4918163 4921290 The key. It's your vault, isn't it, Yuri?
4921458 4924502 What? No. No, I...
4924836 4926629 You put this shit in here, right?
4926797 4927797 What? No.
4927923 4928923 Right?
4929424 4931342 I didn't know, Jack.
4940268 4941936 Is that the dancer down there?
4942312 4943688 What are you talking about?
4944022 4945773 That's a tough break for a good athlete.
4946441 4948985 Jack, you know me.
4951113 4953948 Yeah, I know you. I know you.
4955617 4957284 I know him better.
4959830 4963708 Never was a file, was there, Yuri?
4973385 4974844 Of course there was no file.
4975387 4977388 It was simply bait.
4978223 4980975 What I needed was in this vault.
4981143 4983019 Chagarin was the only one with enough
4983103 4984979 power and influence to get me out of jail.
4985897 4988315 I used him.
4990068 4991819 I used you.
4994322 4996407 It's about money.
4996742 4998325 When's it not about money?
4998493 4999744 You want to arrest me?
5002039 5006500 You're out of your jurisdiction,<br />Detective McClane, aren't you?
5006710 5009253 I wouldn't worry too much about being arrested.
5010380 5012214 See, my boy
5012924 5014925 is in the CIA.
5015218 5017344 No phone call.
5018263 5019597 Spy shit.
5020265 5024351 Goddamn Americans.<br />You think you're so smart.
5025062 5028689 No, I'm not that smart.<br />I'm just on vacation.
5028857 5030524 My boy here,
5032069 5033527 he gonna put a whooping on you.
5039076 5041243 Move!
5047626 5051587 You can say goodbye to your<br />daughter, you dumbwit fuck.
5057135 5059220 Where's your little Soltschanitsa?
5072651 5074318 Shit! God damn it!
5079324 5080324 Shit!
5104015 5105375 Irina, I'm going to the roof...
5105559 5106559 The roof!
5109354 5110646 McClane: Jack!
5129040 5130040 Set at 91.
5130167 5131216 Power plant?
5131251 5132200 All good to go.
5132210 5133210 Let's go!
5163116 5164116 Subtle.
5164784 5166911 What the hell is in those goddamn grenades?
5174085 5175085 Go get him!
5175670 5177755 I'm going to the helicopter!
5232394 5234144 Vadim, watch the tail.
5234312 5236313 Copy. You are at 120 meters...
5237399 5238399 ...115 meters...
5265427 5267307 There is small arms fire coming from the roof.
5281526 5282526 We have a guest.
5283111 5285029 Watch the tail for me there.
5293204 5294204 Come on!
5294205 5295205 Come on, hurry!
5295790 5297708 Vadim, give me firing control now...
5298585 5299585 Engaging!
5305467 5306467 McClane: Jack!
5309596 5310587 Shoot him!
5310597 5311597 With pleasure, papa.
5318396 5320314 I'm on fucking vacation!
5323234 5324474 Vadim! He is there! I see him!
5332077 5334161 The shit we do for our kids.
5334579 5336330 Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.
5340960 5341960 What happened?
5350929 5352262 CG' s shifted...
5353139 5354515 I've got full forward cyclic.
5385505 5387005 I can ' t hold it.
5389926 5390968 Jesus Christ!
5396683 5397683 Well done,
5398309 5399893 Mr. Super-spy.
5402772 5406483 What a shame your father won't be alive<br />to see you promoted.
5407652 5409403 Neither will you.
5424252 5426628 Hey! Jack!
5428840 5430716 Hang on, John!
5468379 5469588 John!
5475303 5476678 Come on!
5485355 5486688 We 're out of ammunition!
5487232 5488232 Shit.
5489108 5490108 Bastards.
5490485 5492236 What the hell are you doing?
5495114 5496114 This is for you, papa.
5560013 5567352 John!
5574986 5575986 John!
5580908 5582075 Dad!
5584454 5585454 Right here.
5612774 5614358 Did you just call me Dad?
5616069 5617194 No.
5618738 5620197 I didn't think so.
5622033 5623533 You're hearing things.
5624619 5627204 You got swimmer's ear.
5636255 5639257 We're not gonna grow any third arms<br />or anything, are we?
5639425 5640592 No.
5641052 5642803 You might lose your hair.
5643429 5644554 LaugHit up, kid.
5645223 5647724 This is you, five years from now.
5648226 5650227 It's rainwater.<br />You'll be fine.
5650394 5653563 Besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.
5655066 5656942 Now you're a McClane?
5657110 5660403 Yeah, I'm a McClane.<br />John McClane.
5660571 5662072 John McClane Junior.
5663074 5665534 Well, that makes you a "senior."
5665701 5667202 That's right.
5667370 5668912 Try not to forget it.
5669080 5670747 I'm your father.
5672125 5674918 Have some respect for your father.
5675920 5677087 Let me ask you something.
5679132 5681258 Do you go looking for trouble
5681425 5683552 or does it always just seem to find you?
5685638 5688598 You know, after all these years,
5689475 5692227 I still ask myself the same question.
