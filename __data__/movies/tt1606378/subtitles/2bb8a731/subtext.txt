1917416 1919496 I swear to God, I will put<br />a bullet in you this time.
1919501 1921003 Who do you think<br />you're talking to?
1921169 1922546 The last person I want to see.
1922963 1924306 Well, maybe you missed<br />the whole part back there
1924464 1926341 where I saved you<br />and Papa Geppetto here
1926508 1928385 from a whole bunch<br />of Russian bad guys.
1928552 1930554 You saved? You saved?
1930720 1932097 That's right, saved.
1932180 1933181 (SPEAKING RUSSIAN)
1933265 1934733 Shut up.<br />Shut up.
1934933 1936526 You're a world class screw-up,<br />you know that, John?
1936685 1939154 I'm a screw-up?<br />I'm a screw-up?
1939312 1940313 I'm still your father.
1940397 1942024 Yeah,<br />nothing I can do about that.
1942482 1943608 What a joke.
1943775 1945277 Just shut up. Try not to<br />touch anything, all right?
1945444 1947071 You've done<br />enough goddamn damage.
1949406 1951625 <i>The appointment is next week...</i>
1951867 1953289 <i>We will begin immediately.</i>
1953368 1955291 <i>Excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped.</i>
1956246 1958326 <i>I'll call you back. There is a problem with Komarov.</i>
1958373 1959249 <i>What happened?</i>
1959708 1961228 <i>Some sort of attack on the courthouse.</i>
1961543 1962635 <i>Who took him?</i>
1962711 1963712 <i>They don't know yet.</i>
1964171 1965548 <i>What do you mean you don't know?</i>
1965964 1966464 <i>Eh...</i>
1966798 1968266 <i>...well it's confusing...</i>
1968758 1971307 <i>Eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov...</i>
1972554 1974022 <i>...with an American.</i>
1975515 1977483 <i>What American?</i>
1980395 1982443 John McClane.
1984774 1985991 Let's go.
1989112 1990364 After you.
1991490 1993913 Yeah, I got him.<br />Okay, I'm on it.
1994075 1996373 Look, Mike, we had an unexpected delay.<br />I'm sorry.
1996453 1997500 I understand.
1997579 1999798 This is the last guy on earth<br />I expected to see.
1999956 2002316 Listen to me, Yuri, you have<br />half of Moscow looking for you.
2002417 2004135 I need you to get dressed.<br />Why am I here?
2004294 2007013 Please put on these clothes.<br />Trust me.
2007172 2009300 This is the key to your cuffs.<br />Take these.
2009466 2010718 Oh, my Jesus.
2010884 2012352 Are you okay?<br />What?
2012511 2014934 Do you have<br />the file on Chagarin?
2016640 2018392 This is what you<br />been doing, Jack?
2019142 2020234 Spy shit?
2022646 2024114 This is it?
2024272 2027242 (LAUGHING)<br />You're a spy? Oh, my God.
2029611 2032785 The 007 of Plainfield,<br />New Jersey.
2033406 2034623 Very nice.
2034783 2036831 McClane, shut up.
2037202 2038704 Take it easy, Oddjob.
2038870 2040713 I'm on vacation.
2040872 2042215 Your mom will be pleased.
2042374 2044172 We thought you were<br />doing drugs or something.
2044334 2045381 Mr. Komarov.
2045502 2048096 Or selling drugs,<br />but that was me, really.
2048797 2051471 Do you have<br />the file on Chagarin?
2051883 2053601 Yes, or no?
2055512 2056855 It's very simple, Yuri.
2056972 2059225 You give me the file,<br />and I get you out of Russia.
2059933 2062812 And you're a free man.<br />What do you say?
2065522 2068947 It's not about me.<br />I don't care about my life.
2070569 2071661 Well, that's the deal.
2071820 2073117 It's the only deal.
2074114 2076116 Come on.
2077117 2079836 Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
2080662 2082039 What's it gonna be?
2083790 2085918 Yes or no?
2086084 2088883 The clock is ticking, Yuri.<br />Come on.
2090046 2091923 You will get me out of here?
2092090 2093182 Only the three of you?
2093341 2095560 Whoa, Nijinsky.<br />I'm not in the gang.
2095719 2098017 I just got off the plane.<br />I'm still jet-lagged.
2098179 2101058 I'm not involved in this.<br />Huh, Jack?
2103810 2106279 Only if I can take<br />my daughter with me.
2109733 2111861 Chagarin's people<br />will kill her.
2114195 2116323 Fine. Make it quick.
2117532 2118533 Ah.
2118617 2119994 Where's the file?
2121036 2123915 It's in a vault in Prypiat, but<br />the key is here in Moscow.
2124080 2125206 At Hotel Ukraina.

2288536 2291210 What was that, John? Five minutes?<br />Five minutes?
2291372 2293090 You blew a three-year op<br />in five minutes!
2293249 2294889 You're welcome!<br />What do you want me to do?
2296920 2299139 Unbelievable.
2299297 2302392 I'm so fucking burned. I got no<br />friends in this town anymore.
2302550 2305394 What about your people at Langley?<br />Just give them a call.
2305553 2307806 Give me your phone.
2310016 2311643 (PHONE SHATTERS)
2315563 2317736 It's a two-year contract<br />on that phone.
2317899 2320072 What are you carrying?<br />Give me that.
2322070 2323697 All right.<br />You got any cash on you?
2324781 2326374 Some American money.
2326533 2328956 What are you talking about?<br />We need to keep on moving.
2329410 2332755 We have to get this guy to a doctor.<br />To medical attention, Jack.
2332914 2333915 The mission stands.
2334123 2336467 Your mission is<br />bleeding out over there.
2336626 2338754 The mission continues.<br />We go to the hotel.
2342590 2346140 Come on, let's move.<br />Let's move.
2357772 2358944 This is nuts.
2359232 2360825 What, are you going to go out<br />and kill somebody else now?
2360984 2362736 Why all this trouble<br />for just one guy?
2362944 2364662 He's a political prisoner.
2365238 2366330 Not that you care, John,
2366489 2368787 but it's a matter of national<br />security, all right?
2368950 2372420 He's got the goods to stop Viktor<br />Chagarin, and we need that to happen.
2372579 2373626 Well, great, Jack.
2373788 2375665 Let's drop him off at the<br />Embassy, and we can go home.
2375832 2378335 Are you kidding me? After what<br />happened at the safe house?
2379669 2381012 Look, it doesn't work<br />like that, all right?
2381170 2383290 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and I'm a burnable asset.
2383339 2386138 So, I now need that file<br />to un-fuck this mission.
2386342 2387434 Any more questions?
2387594 2389016 Yeah, just one.
2389178 2391306 How come you never called<br />and told me where you were?
2391973 2393475 Like you'd give a shit.
2411743 2412790 Shit.
2413328 2415126 Well, we're not going in the front door.
2425256 2427258 All right, hold up, hold up.
2431054 2434354 Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right?<br />We're almost done.
2434891 2437019 As soon as we get that key,<br />we're gonna grab the file,
2437226 2439228 get you and your daughter<br />out of Russia, all right?
2439395 2440692 All right.
2442023 2445869 Listen to me, you're doing good.<br />All right?
2446027 2448347 I need you to hang here a second.<br />Keep an eye on him, John.
2448446 2449572 Hey, hey.
2449739 2453369 What is it with all this "John" shit?<br />Whatever happened to "Dad?"
2454035 2455708 Good question.
2458873 2461592 In Russia, we have<br />word for men like him.
2462377 2463879 <i>"Krutoi."</i>
2464796 2467970 It means "tough,"<br />"hard."
2468132 2471477 In America, it means<br />"juvenile delinquent."
2473554 2475648 Is he your only child?
2477225 2480069 No. I got a daughter, too.
2480895 2483114 You?
2485984 2488828 I have only my <i>Solnyschka.</i>
2489570 2492995 When she was little,<br />I was working all the time.
2493908 2496912 I believed work was<br />all that mattered.
2502333 2504836 I screwed my<br />kid's life up, too.
2505086 2506087 You work all the time
2506170 2509094 around the clock most of the<br />time, when you're a cop.
2509507 2514934 I just thought that working all the<br />time was a good thing, you know?
2520935 2522437 I didn't help him at all.
2525523 2527446 It's never too late,
2528776 2529948 I hope.
2532947 2534790 Okay, let's go.
2544459 2546939 All right, Yuri, which part of<br />the building is the ballroom in?
2546961 2547962 Main tower.
2548129 2549676 Main tower.<br />Which floor?
2549797 2552471 Top floor.
2552592 2553593 What about security?
2553676 2555519 You remember any guards?<br />Cameras? Anything like that?
2555678 2557555 I don't know.
2557722 2559224 Well, I need you to remember.
2559390 2561392 I was in prison for five<br />years, how should I know?
2561642 2563360 Everything could have changed.<br />I know.
2563519 2566193 Just think, all right?<br />Picture it in your head.
2567023 2568991 The ballroom was closed in '89.
2569150 2571152 I think it's under<br />construction now.
2571486 2572908 JACK: So that floor's<br />unsecured.
2573071 2575369 KOMAROV: I don't know! Listen!<br />My daughter is in there.
