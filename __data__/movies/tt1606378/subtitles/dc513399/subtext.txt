61561 62979 <i>The case against Mr. Komarov</i>
63063 66316 <i>has caused widespread division<br />amongst the Russian public,</i>
66399 69778 <i>some of whom view his incarceration<br />as a political maneuver</i>

120704 122580 <i>...we could be again.</i>
124457 126042 <i>Just give me the file...</i>
127252 131131 <i>...and I'll hand your life back to you.</i>
133466 136261 <i>Forget this stupid trial.</i>
138763 140473 <i>I don't want my life back.</i>

183516 185185 -Shit.<br />-I'll see if we got local.
254421 255922 <i>We are ready to get started.</i>
256506 257590 <i>Make the call.</i>

322280 324199 Hey, Murph, how you doing?
324282 326368 Nice grouping, Grandpa.
327786 330413 Yeah, not bad.
332290 334334 Is that it?
335168 337921 Yep. We found him.
338546 340715 It's not good, John.
342050 344052 Hospital or morgue?
345345 346971 Worse.
348598 351434 When was the last time<br />you spoke to this kid?
353019 354771 It's been a while.
356231 358483 Maybe a few years, even.
360402 363655 Last time I saw him, it was pretty ugly.
366324 368785 Well, there's<br />a few different versions in there,
368868 373665 but my people are pretty sure<br />he's being held at a Moscow prison
373748 376167 awaiting sentencing.
376251 378128 What's he charged with?
378211 379421 It's a nasty sheet.
382048 384634 He'll be lucky to get life.
388221 390974 He can never get out of his own way.
392559 394728 He had a lot of problems.
396896 398898 He's still my kid.
400567 402318 I know.
402402 406781 But it's Russia.<br />They do things differently over there.
409451 410952 Me, too.
413997 415165 Good luck, Poppy.

431598 434601 This isn't your fault. You know?

1911703 1914497 Please put on these clothes.<br />Trust me.
1914581 1916791 This is the key to your cuffs. Take these.
1916875 1918168 Oh, my Jesus.
1918251 1919836 -Are you okay?<br />-What?
1919919 1922297 Do you have the file on Chagarin?
1924049 1925759 This is what you been doing, Jack?
1926551 1927594 Spy shit?
1930055 1931556 This is it?
1931639 1934601 You're a spy? Oh, my God.
1936978 1940148 The 007 of Plainfield, New Jersey.
1940774 1942067 Very nice.
1942150 1944235 McClane, shut up.
1944611 1946196 Take it easy, Oddjob.
1946279 1948198 I'm on vacation.
1948281 1949699 Your mom will be pleased.
1949783 1951659 We thought you were<br />doing drugs or something.
1951743 1952827 Mr. Komarov.
1952911 1955455 Or selling drugs,<br />but that was me, really.
1956164 1958833 Do you have the file on Chagarin?
1959292 1960960 Yes, or no?
1962921 1964255 It's very simple, Yuri.
1964339 1966633 You give me the file,<br />and I get you out of Russia.
1967300 1970178 And you're a free man. What do you say?
1972931 1976309 It's not about me.<br />I don't care about my life.
1977977 1979104 Well, that's the deal.
1979187 1980480 It's the only deal.
1981481 1983483 Come on.
1984484 1987195 Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
1988029 1989447 What's it gonna be?
1991157 1993410 Yes or no?
1993493 1996287 The clock is ticking, Yuri. Come on.
1997455 1999416 You will get me out of here?
1999499 2000625 Only the three of you?
2000709 2003044 Whoa, Nijinsky. I'm not in the gang.
2003128 2005463 I just got off the plane.<br />I'm still jet-lagged.
2005547 2008466 I'm not involved in this. Huh, Jack?
2011177 2013680 Only if I can take my daughter with me.
2017142 2019227 Chagarin's people will kill her.
2021563 2023690 Fine. Make it quick.
2026026 2027360 Where's the file?
2028403 2031406 It's in a vault in Prypiat, but the key<br />is here in Moscow.
2031489 2032574 At Hotel Ukraina.
2036202 2040040 Make your call.<br />We're going to the Ukraina, let's go.
2048173 2049174 <i>It's papa...</i>
2051051 2052218 <i>I'm fine, Sunshine...</i>
2053053 2053887 <i>...we'll talk later.</i>
2054596 2055597 <i>Listen.</i>
2056222 2058516 <i>I'll be waiting for you<br />where your mother and I shared our first dance.</i>
2058933 2059934 <i>Now.</i>
2061728 2063229 <i>Hurry! Hurry! You understand?</i>
2073531 2076368 Mike, listen, I'm sorry about<br />this morning, man.
2077911 2080080 It's fine.
2081081 2083583 Okay, let's go.
2088088 2089089 Contact!
2092092 2093677 Down! Get down!
2093927 2095512 Go! Get down! Go, go, go!
2099015 2100266 John, cover!
2116032 2117033 Come on, buddy!
2119452 2121454 Go! Go!
2128086 2129796 That's right, jerk-off!
2129879 2131131 All right, let's move, John!
2131214 2132674 I'm on fucking vacation!
2132757 2134634 Come on, time to hustle.<br />Watch your head.
2136636 2137721 McClane, move it.
2137804 2139723 8,000 fucking miles for this?
2144811 2146563 Get down, Yuri. Stay low!
2146813 2147981 Head down.
2148064 2149816 Come on. Go, go!
2163788 2165165 Safe house, my ass.
2171046 2173131 -He knows how old we are, no?<br />-Come on.
2178345 2179471 Here, here, here.
2179554 2181765 Sit down. You're all right.
2181848 2183058 Let me look at you.
2183683 2185101 It's all right. You're fine.
2185185 2186603 What are you doing?
2188063 2189105 Jack.
2189189 2191107 Calm down, Yuri, okay?<br />You're gonna be just fine.
2191191 2193985 Here, put this on, stay warm.
2195945 2198656 What was that, John? Five minutes?<br />Five minutes?
2198740 2200575 You blew a three-year op<br />in five minutes!
2200658 2201910 You're welcome!<br />What do you want me to do?
2204329 2205372 Unbelievable.
2205455 2206623 Unbelievable.
2206706 2209876 I'm so fucking burned.<br />I got no friends in this town anymore.
2209959 2212837 What about your people at Langley?<br />Just give them a call.
2212921 2215215 Give me your phone.
2222931 2225225 It's a two-year contract on that phone.
2225308 2227435 What are you carrying? Give me that.
2229437 2231064 All right. You got any cash on you?
2232190 2233817 Some American money.
2233900 2236361 What are you talking about?<br />We need to keep on moving.
2236820 2240240 We have to get this guy to a doctor.<br />To medical attention, Jack.
2240323 2241449 The mission stands.
2241533 2243952 Your mission is bleeding out over there.
2244035 2246162 The mission continues.<br />We go to the hotel.
2249958 2253545 Come on, let's move. Let's move.
2265181 2266307 This is nuts.
2266599 2268309 What, are you going to go out<br />and kill somebody else now?
2268393 2270103 Why all this trouble for just one guy?
2270353 2272063 He's a political prisoner.
2272605 2273815 Not that you care, John,
2273898 2276276 but it's a matter of national security,<br />all right?
2276359 2279863 He's got the goods to stop Viktor Chagarin,<br />and we need that to happen.
2279946 2281114 Well, great, Jack.
2281197 2283158 Let's drop him off at the Embassy,<br />and we can go home.
2283241 2285744 Are you kidding me?<br />After what happened at the safe house?
2287078 2288496 Look, it doesn't work like that,<br />all right?
2288580 2290665 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and I'm a burnable asset.
2290749 2293668 So, I now need that file<br />to un-fuck this mission.
2293752 2294878 Any more questions?
2294961 2296504 Yeah, just one.
2296588 2298673 How come you never called<br />and told me where you were?
2299382 2300800 Like you'd give a shit.
2312395 2314397 All right, hold up, hold up.
2318193 2321488 Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right?<br />We're almost done.
2322030 2324282 As soon as we get that key,<br />we're gonna grab the file,
2324366 2326451 get you and your daughter<br />out of Russia, all right?
2326534 2327827 All right.
2329162 2333083 Listen to me, you're doing good.<br />All right?
2333166 2335502 I need you to hang here a second.<br />Keep an eye on him, John.
2335585 2336795 Hey, hey.
2336878 2340507 What is it with all this "John" shit?<br />Whatever happened to "Dad?"
2341174 2342842 Good question.
2346012 2348723 In Russia, we have word for men like him.
2349516 2351017 <i>"Krutoi."</i>
2351935 2355188 It means "tough," "hard."
2355271 2358608 In America,  it means<br />"juvenile delinquent."
2360694 2362779 Is he your only child?
2364364 2367200 No. I got a daughter, too.
2368034 2370245 You?
2373123 2375959 I have only my <i>Solnyschka.</i>
2376710 2380130 When she was little,<br />I was working all the time.
2381047 2384050 I believed work was all that mattered.
2389472 2391975 I screwed my kid's life up, too.
2392225 2393226 You work all the time
2393309 2396229 around the clock<br />most of the time, when you're a cop.
2396646 2402068 I just thought that working all the time<br />was a good thing, you know?
2408074 2409576 I didn't help him at all.
2412662 2414581 It's never too late,
2415915 2417083 I hope.
2420086 2421921 Okay, let's go.
2431598 2434017 All right, Yuri, which part of the<br />building is the ballroom in?
2434100 2435185 Main tower.
2435268 2436853 Main tower. Which floor?
2436936 2437937 Top floor.
2438021 2439647 Top floor.
2439731 2440732 What about security?
2440815 2442734 You remember any guards?<br />Cameras? Anything like that?
2442817 2444778 I don't know.
2444861 2446446 Well, I need you to remember.
2446529 2448531 I was in prison for five years,<br />how should I know?
2448782 2450575 -Everything could have changed.<br />-I know.
2450658 2453328 Just think, all right?<br />Picture it in your head.
2454162 2458291 The ballroom was closed in '89.<br />I think it's under construction now.
2458625 2460126 So that floor's unsecured.
2460210 2462712 I don't know! Listen!<br />My daughter is in there.
2462796 2465965 -I'm scared to death, let's go!<br />-Just calm down, Yuri.
2491032 2493076 I guess you have done that before.
2495704 2497038 Smart.
2499874 2501918 I could have done it.
2544711 2546880 Irina?
2547714 2549883 Irina?
2555722 2557807 Irina?
2562812 2563938 Papa.
2567901 2569402 -Irina.<br />-Papa!
2572280 2574282 That's tender.
2574908 2576826 Really? I wouldn't know.
2587295 2588755 Need a hug?
2591424 2593760 We're not really a hugging family.
2593843 2595428 That's right.
2597180 2598640 <i>We just have to get one thing...</i>
2599516 2601434 <i>...and then we're leaving Moscow for good.</i>
2602268 2603186 <i>OK?</i>
2603269 2604270 <i>OK.</i>
2611695 2612612 <i>Who are they?</i>
2615865 2617659 The young one works for CIA.
2618535 2621287 The old one is his father.<br />Americans.
2623123 2624290 <i>Then thank God for them.</i>
2626459 2628712 There's something no good about this.
2628795 2630171 Just shut up, all right?
2631965 2633049 I'm telling you, Jack,
2633967 2635468 this smells bad.
2637470 2639139 Just stop, okay?
2639472 2643893 This might seem like a totally<br />foreign concept, you know?
2643977 2646312 I know you love to just run in,<br />making shit up.
2646396 2648148 But like any professional,<br />I have a plan.
2648231 2650108 So let's just stick to it, okay?
2650191 2651609 Just move your plan along.
2652235 2654070 All right, Yuri, come on.<br />Let's grab the key, get out of here.
2654154 2655530 Yes.
2656239 2657991 Just take a moment.
2676509 2677510 How you doing?
2680096 2681598 Fine.
2691524 2693360 How did you get over here so quick?
2696696 2697864 Well...
2698782 2701576 I took Garden Ring.
2701868 2706039 Oh, the Garden Ring.<br />Supposed to always be bad, right?
2716132 2717258 Hey, John.
2717550 2718718 Did you get stuck in traffic?
2721054 2723306 I have it! I have it.
2726601 2728561 Welcome, Americans.
2735068 2736903 Put your goddamn guns down, asshole!
2745620 2747580 <i>Papa, what is going on?</i>
2751167 2752794 Give me your weapons.
2753586 2754838 Come and get them.
2761261 2762429 Really?
2763596 2764764 Really.
2767517 2768643 Papa.
2771187 2773815 -Yuri.<br />-Do it.
2775984 2777777 I thought you were a problem child.
2796171 2798798 This a part of your plan, Mr. Professional?
2801843 2802969 <i>What are you doing?</i>
2803678 2805138 <i>It's about money, papa...</i>
2805722 2807223 <i>...millions of dollars.</i>
2807640 2808892 <i>You think life was easy for me?</i>
2808975 2810894 <i>While you were sitting in prison being a victim?</i>
2812062 2813313 But,
2813396 2815732 I'm your father.
2817734 2819319 And I am your daughter.
2820570 2822906 We should kill the old man now.
2822989 2824324 We still need him.
2824699 2826076 But them you can kill.
2826493 2828036 Thank you.
2831331 2832332 Hi.
2834084 2836169 I don't know if I'm saying this right.
2837671 2838672 Hi.
2841049 2844719 Do you know what I hate<br />about the Americans?
2846012 2847180 Everything.
2848598 2850725 Especially cowboys.
2869911 2873748 I could have been a dancer.<br />I swear to God.
2878545 2880964 But nobody supported me.
2885510 2886511 You two
2889055 2891641 have been such a
2891725 2894811 pain in the ass!
2912704 2914581 I prefer dancing, really.
2915290 2920128 But killing is much, much better than<br />working in a grocery shop!
2924549 2925592 Jesus Christ!
2928261 2929262 Nice one.
2942609 2945278 You guys. So arrogant.
2945779 2947781 It's not 1986, you know.
2949949 2951743 Reagan is dead.
2959292 2962045 Sorry. Oh, God.
2971971 2973306 What's funny there?
2974140 2975141 Can't tell you.
2976101 2978645 It's not you. I love these outfits.
2979813 2981981 You guys are looking good.
2990240 2992325 That was enough, thank you.
2995620 2996663 Let's dance.
3014389 3015390 Come on! Come on!
3027777 3028862 Jack!
3029738 3032490 Remember the last time we talked<br />just before you went away?
3033950 3035702 Oh, no! No, no!
3035785 3038246 You're not gonna<br />open up to me right before we die!
3039998 3041750 No, that's not your thing, John.
3041833 3043043 What's my thing?
3043126 3045420 Fucking killing bad guys,<br />that's your thing!
3047047 3048757 You're not gonna die today!
3076159 3077911 Go!
3110110 3111361 Shit!
3112112 3113113 Fuck.
3114155 3115657 We're finished, John.
3125458 3127002 I can't believe this.
3133925 3136136 I can't believe this.<br />This is unbelievable.
3144477 3146563 Jack. Hey!
3154654 3155655 Jesus!
3159409 3160410 Come on!
3168293 3169294 Let's get out of this building!
3185477 3186478 <i>Where are they?</i>
3190523 3191524 Come on.
3216383 3218009 <i>Alik, that's it. We're done!</i>
3218093 3218843 <i>Let's go!</i>
3218927 3219803 <i>Break left!</i>
3219886 3220887 <i>Copy, Commander.</i>
3255005 3256006 <i>Do you have him?</i>
3256089 3257590 Yes.
3257674 3258675 <i>And the file?</i>
3258758 3260343 <i>Does he have it?</i>
3260927 3263221 <i>I need that file, Alik.</i>
3263304 3264848 He's taking us to it.
3266266 3268685 <i>No more mistakes, Alik.</i>
3269310 3270979 <i>And when you have the file...</i>
3271771 3273523 <i>...kill them both.</i>
3275108 3276109 Yes, sir.
3294336 3295462 Shit.
3299966 3302385 That was exciting.
3302469 3304971 Yeah. Loads of fun.
3306181 3308141 You wanna go again?
3311311 3312562 Are you shot?
3312645 3313646 No.
3314147 3315315 No, I'm fine.
3316149 3317776 Let me take a look at that.
3317859 3319652 It's fine.
3320528 3322072 Oh, fuck.
3322155 3325408 I can't believe she betrayed<br />her father for Chagarin.
3326826 3328995 I don't understand that.
3330872 3332999 Someday you will.
3333833 3335251 Kids.
3338672 3340882 What's our next move?
3341549 3343677 I don't know.
3344094 3346137 -You don't know?<br />-I don't know, all right?
3346221 3348264 I mean, I'm out of moves. I don't know.
3348723 3350183 I don't know.
3351685 3353186 I screwed up.
3354104 3355689 I blew the mission.
3363238 3365448 Well, then we're done, right?
3365532 3368034 -Yeah, we're done.<br />-We're done.
3368118 3370453 We should just go home.
3370537 3373206 We'll stop by a little pharmacy<br />on our way out of Moscow,
3373289 3376960 get you some Merthiolate<br />or mercury
3377043 3378586 and fix up your little scratches, here.
3378962 3381881 Get you home. Get a little toy set.
3382382 3385885 Get yourself a nice warm glass of milk<br />with a little Bosco in it.
3385969 3387637 Get your CIA slippers.
3387721 3388972 All right.
3389055 3390724 -What?<br />-I get it.
3391641 3393727 What the hell are we gonna do?
3394602 3396813 What's in the file?
3396896 3399441 Evidence on Chagarin.
3403236 3404779 Evidence about what?
3405572 3407907 Chernobyl.
3410577 3412245 Look, listen to me.
3412328 3414414 Komarov and Chagarin used to have this
3414497 3418918 nasty little side-racket going on<br />back in the day.
3420962 3424132 They siphoned weapons-grade uranium,<br />got greedy,
3424758 3427177 caused the meltdown.
3428762 3432057 Then, you know, they fell out.
3432140 3434768 Former partners, bad break-up.
3436269 3437979 Scumbags.
3439105 3440940 So, Chagarin had Komarov thrown in jail.
3441024 3443777 You know, put him in a hole,<br />forget about him.
3443860 3445779 Doesn't have to worry anymore.
3447280 3449491 So what happened to rescuesque?
3450116 3452285 Well, he grew a conscience.
3454162 3456873 Yeah, well, that figures.
3456956 3461252 Listen, Chagarin is bad news.<br />He's the real deal.
3461336 3465131 If we see this guy in control,<br />we're gonna see the whole thing fall apart.
3465215 3468468 I'm talking terrorism,
3468551 3470387 WMDs,
3471012 3472389 nukes.
3476226 3478687 Someone has to stop him.
3479979 3482857 Well, that's what we do.
3484651 3489239 We go out to Chiapep<br />and we do our thing.
3490907 3492492 Our thing?
3492575 3493576 Yeah.
3494911 3497372 We go out there<br />and kill a lot of scumbags.
3504004 3506506 What? You got something better to do?
3506589 3509551 All right. Pull it.
3510093 3511886 You're not gonna cry, are you?
3511970 3513888 Just pull it.
3513972 3516016 Everybody needs a good cry<br />once in a while, Jack.
3516516 3518226 -Don't be ashamed.<br />-Pull it.
3518476 3520103 You remember that time when
3520186 3524399 you and Ralphie Mauser were gonna have<br />that house-painting job?
3524482 3527402 Got your finger caught in the ladder,<br />you cried for about five, six days.
3527485 3528778 John, just pull it!
3529195 3531448 All right.
3531531 3533491 On three. Here you go.
3533825 3535702 One, two...
3540707 3541958 Good God.
3542042 3543626 Jesus.
3545462 3547505 When was the last time<br />you had a tetanus shot?
3553094 3554637 You all right?
3554721 3555972 Yeah.
3557265 3558767 We need a car.
3559434 3561019 Atta boy.
3561102 3562395 Back to work.
3582248 3585126 Hey, Watergate, how's that lock coming?
3585210 3586878 Almost there.
3586961 3588755 Here, try these.
3590006 3591257 Come on.
3591341 3593760 Oh, stealing. That's nice.<br />Real nice, John.
3594052 3596596 Yeah, I'm up for the<br />Father of the Year award.
3598807 3599849 Whoa.
3602394 3603978 All right.
3604062 3606106 How'd you know all of these<br />guns were gonna be here?
3606189 3608274 It's a Chechen hangout.
3608358 3612070 Owner doesn't like guns in the club,<br />so these bozos leave them in their cars.
3612487 3614322 You learn a lot in three years.
3614406 3615407 Yeah.
3621413 3623665 Are we really going to Chernobyl?
3624249 3625750 Yeah.
3626835 3628169 The Chernobyl.
3629170 3630588 The radioactive joint? Meltdown?
3630672 3632382 That's the one.
3634009 3636094 It's not the Chernobyl<br />in Switzerland, right?
3636177 3639431 With all the skiing and<br />the snow and everything?
3639514 3641558 You mean Grenoble?
3642892 3645937 No, sorry, we're not going to Grenoble.
3652861 3655447 Eddie Collins's kid<br />took him on vacation last year.
3655530 3656990 They went down to Boca.
3657073 3659200 -Oh, yeah?<br />-Spent four days at the track.
3659451 3661119 Well, that's nice.
3661494 3663246 That's relaxing.
3663329 3665832 Oh, yeah. Sure.
3667167 3669294 We have to go to Chernobyl?
3669377 3671212 Yeah, sorry about that.
3671755 3674632 But all the radioactive stuff<br />is out, right?
3710669 3712504 <i>Is it as you remember, papa?</i>
3713129 3714297 <i>I don't want to remember.</i>
3716383 3717217 <i>Tough.</i>
3719844 3720845 <i>The file...</i>
3721304 3722472 <i>...is in the inner vault.</i>
3725225 3727852 Very touching. Let's move.
3752252 3753753 Which one is it?
3754421 3756715 <i>Get moving, old goat.</i>
3774399 3777944 Couple of fresh coats of paint<br />and a weedwacker and it's good to go.
3786119 3788997 You know, at first, they denied<br />anything even happened.
3789080 3791666 Held a children's parade the next day<br />to prove it.
3792167 3796254 24 hours later,<br />50,000 residents were evacuated.
3797130 3799090 Never came back.
3800800 3803970 As soon as they get in that vault,<br />Komarov's a dead man.
3806639 3808141 All right.
3852352 3854187 You got a plan?
3855355 3856523 Not really.
3857691 3859943 I kind of thought we'd just wing it.
3860026 3864531 You know, run in, guns blazing,<br />making shit up as we go.
3865657 3866908 -Yeah?<br />-Yeah.
3870912 3872455 What is this? A pirate gun?
3872539 3875041 Yeah. It's old school, man.
3875375 3876376 Like you, right?
3876751 3878378 Yeah, like me.
3881381 3884175 One of these days,<br />I'm gonna have a long talk with you.
3900900 3902444 Look, Jack,
3903570 3905697 I'm sorry your partner got killed.
3907741 3911703 I'm sorry I fucked up your day.<br />That wasn't my plan.
3913079 3915165 I caused you problems.
3915248 3918585 You know, I came here for something else.
3922380 3925383 And all that other bullshit. I mean,
3929137 3930930 I had a pretty good day.
3933391 3936269 It's fun, running around with you.
3942233 3943902 It's good to see you.
3949991 3952410 I love you, boy.
3958124 3959584 You, too.
3961836 3964005 I want you to know I got your back.
3967676 3969678 I got yours, too.
3974099 3977477 All right.<br />Let's go kill some motherfuckers.
3999290 4000291 <i>Key.</i>
4083583 4086252 Okay, what the fuck is this?
4086753 4090173 I'm losing my patience.<br />The fucking file better be here.
4094803 4097430 Radiation has been pooling<br />in this room for decades.
4100266 4102477 You've underestimated us,<br />Daddy dearest.
4103103 4104771 <i>Bring it in!</i>
4148648 4150150 Atta boy.
4155822 4156656 <i>Come on! Come on!</i>
4157699 4162954 Compound 27-4.<br />It neutralizes radiation, trust me.
4176384 4179012 What's this remind you of?
4180597 4181598 Newark.
4201034 4204746 All clear. We can ditch the suits.
4229062 4231898 The hell is that?
4233650 4237278 One billion euros worth of<br />enriched uranium.
4238822 4240323 What?
4241574 4244619 Don't worry, it's stable in this form.
4244703 4245745 File!
4247747 4251584 Irina, cut the crap, please.
4252002 4255422 No one here is speaking about uranium.<br />Where's the file?
4256589 4258925 No more games, where is the file?
4264597 4267267 That's no longer your concern.
4292292 4293126 <i>Sunshine...</i>
4294002 4295045 <i>...you did well.</i>
4298965 4300133 <i>I told you...</i>
4300967 4302052 <i>...everything would work out.</i>
4305221 4306139 <i>Come to papa.</i>
4319903 4320987 <i>Pap, you're a genius.</i>
4322572 4323573 <i>I know.</i>

4332499 4333958 <i>Pegasus?</i>
4334042 4335043 <i>Do you copy?</i>
4383717 4386052 A lot of hardware for a file.
4395395 4396604 <i>Wheels up in five minutes.</i>
4397564 4398565 <i>Perfect.</i>
4439606 4440607 <i>Here you go, sir.</i>
4440940 4442942 <i>Team extraction completed. She's all yours.</i>
4443443 4444444 <i>Good.</i>
4474474 4475809 <i>Are you inside?</i>
4476393 4477268 <i>Yes, yes, Viktor.</i>
4479646 4480897 <i>I'm inside.</i>
4483817 4484818 <i>Yuri?</i>
4486403 4487237 <i>You surprised?</i>
4489572 4491991 <i>I'm in the same place where it all started...</i>
4492951 4494494 <i>...before you betrayed me.</i>
4495453 4496454 <i>Remember...</i>
4498164 4500667 <i>...you promised to give me my life back.</i>
4501918 4503169 <i>You gave it back to me.</i>
4504963 4505839 <i>I thank you for that.</i>
4508341 4509592 <i>And now...</i>
4510343 4511678 <i>...I'm going to take yours.</i>
4541875 4543418 <i>Static 4, we are ready for take off.</i>
4545670 4548006 <i>Static 4, do you copy?</i>
4553136 4554596 Yuri!
4558266 4559809 Yuri.
4559893 4562062 Where's the dancer?
4562520 4564939 You okay? You hurt?
4565023 4566524 No.
4569402 4570403 I'm good.
4574157 4575700 I'm all right.
4580413 4582791 What's in these boxes?
4585919 4587796 Thank God you're here, Jack.
4589005 4590340 We have to leave.
4590632 4592008 They're coming back any minute.
4594761 4597263 Just let me get the file.
4597555 4599099 What's in the boxes?
4602602 4604813 It's U-235.
4606690 4608942 Weapons-grade uranium.
4610902 4612904 Armored cases.
4618576 4619953 The bomb kind?
4621705 4624040 Yeah, the bomb kind.
4629879 4631464 Not so fast, Eddie.
4631548 4632716 Are you crazy?
4633758 4635343 Yeah, a little bit.
4635427 4636720 I'm getting the file.
4638054 4640890 No. No, you're not.
4641766 4644936 The key.<br />It's your vault, isn't it, Yuri?
4645020 4648106 What? No. No, I...
4648440 4650275 You put this shit in here, right?
4650358 4652485 -What? No.<br />-Right?
4652986 4654904 I didn't know, Jack.
4663830 4665498 Is that the dancer down there?
4665874 4667292 What are you talking about?
4667584 4669336 That's a tough break for a good athlete.
4670003 4672547 Jack, you know me.
4674674 4677510 Yeah, I know you. I know you.
4679179 4680847 I know him better.
4683391 4687270 Never was a file, was there, Yuri?
4696946 4698406 Of course there was no file.
4698990 4700950 It was simply bait.
4701785 4704621 What I needed was in this vault.
4704704 4708541 Chagarin was the only one with enough<br />power and influence to get me out of jail.
4709501 4711878 I used him.
4713630 4715382 I used you.
4717884 4720011 It's about money.
4720303 4721971 When's it not about money?
4722055 4723348 You want to arrest me?
4725600 4730188 You're out of your jurisdiction,<br />Detective McClane, aren't you?
4730271 4732816 I wouldn't worry too much<br />about being arrested.
4733942 4735777 See, my boy
4736528 4738488 is in the CIA.
4738780 4740907 No phone call.
4741866 4743159 Spy shit.
4743827 4747914 Goddamn Americans.<br />You think you're so smart.
4748623 4752335 No, I'm not that smart.<br />I'm just on vacation.
4752419 4754087 My boy here,
4755630 4757090 he gonna put a whooping on you.
4762637 4764806 Move!
4771229 4775150 You can say goodbye to your daughter,<br />you dumbwit fuck.
4780697 4782782 Where's your little Soltschanitsa?
4796212 4797881 -Shit!<br />-God damn it!
4802886 4803887 Shit!
4827619 4828495 <i>Irina, I'm going to the roof...</i>

4895270 4896271 Go get him!
4896896 4898898 I'm going to the helicopter!
4953620 4955413 <i>Vadim, watch the tail.</i>
4955497 4957540 <i>Copy. You are at 120 meters...</i>
4958625 4959626 <i>...115 meters...</i>
4986653 4987862 <i>There is small arms fire coming from the roof.</i>
5002752 5004254 <i>We have a guest.</i>
5004337 5006256 <i>Watch the tail for me there.</i>
5014389 5015306 <i>Come on!</i>

5030822 5031740 <i>Shoot him!</i>
5031823 5032741 <i>With pleasure, papa.</i>
5039622 5041541 I'm on fucking vacation!
5044419 5045670 <i>Vadim! He is there! I see him!</i>
5053303 5055388 The shit we do for our kids.
5055764 5057557 Yippee ki-yay, motherfucker.
5062187 5063104 <i>What happened?</i>
5072113 5073448 <i>CG's shifted...</i>
5074366 5075742 <i>I've got full forward cyclic.</i>
5106731 5108233 <i>I can't hold it.</i>
5111111 5112153 Jesus Christ!
5117909 5118910 Well done,
5119536 5121121 Mr. Super-spy.
5123957 5127752 What a shame your father<br />won't be alive to see you promoted.
5128878 5130630 Neither will you.
5145478 5147814 Hey! Jack!
5150066 5151943 Hang on, John!
5189606 5190815 John!

5211711 5213463 <i>What the hell are you doing?</i>
5216341 5217175 <i>This is for you, papa.</i>
5281239 5282240 John!

5305638 5306639 Right here.
5334000 5335377 Did you just call me Dad?
5337295 5338421 No.
5339964 5341424 I didn't think so.
5343259 5344761 You're hearing things.
5345845 5348390 You got swimmer's ear.
5357482 5360568 We're not gonna grow any<br />third arms or anything, are we?
5360652 5361820 No.
5362278 5364030 You might lose your hair.
5364656 5365782 Laugh it up, kid.
5366408 5368952 This is you, five years from now.
5369411 5371496 It's rainwater. You'll be fine.
5371579 5374749 Besides, it's hard to kill a McClane.
5376292 5378253 Now you're a McClane?
5378336 5381715 Yeah, I'm a McClane. John McClane.
5381798 5383258 John McClane Junior.
5384300 5386803 Well, that makes you a "senior."
5386886 5388471 That's right.
5388555 5390223 Try not to forget it.
5390306 5391933 I'm your father.
5393351 5396146 Have some respect for your father.
5397105 5398314 Let me ask you something.
5400358 5404738 Do you go looking for trouble or<br />does it always just seem to find you?
5406865 5409826 You know, after all these years,
5410702 5413413 I still ask myself the same question.
