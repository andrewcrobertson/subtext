55680 57850 for mass protests<br />against the trial
57970 60140 of former billionaire<br />Yuri Komarov.
60310 61650 The case against Mr. Komarov
61810 64980 has caused widespread division<br />amongst the Russian public,
65140 68490 some of whom view his incarceration<br />as a political maneuver
68650 71030 orchestrated by this man,
71150 73570 defense minister<br />candidate Viktor Chagarin.
80120 81460 What do you want Viktor?

119490 121370 ...are could be again.
123240 124840 Just give me the file...
126040 129880 ...and I'll hand your life back to you.
132250 135010 Forget this stupid trial.
137510 139230 I don't want my life hack.
146640 152780 You think I'm going to let you talk tomorrow?

372530 374880 awaiting sentencing.
375040 376830 What's he charged with?
377000 378210 It's a nasty sheet.

1934930 1936520 You're a world class screw-up,<br />you know that, John?
1936680 1939150 I'm a screw-up?<br />I'm a screw-up?
1939310 1940310 I'm still your father.
1940390 1942020 Yeah,<br />nothing I can do about that.
1942480 1943600 What a joke.
1943770 1945270 Just shut up. Try not to<br />touch anything, all right?
1945440 1947070 You've done<br />enough goddamn damage.
1949400 1951620 The appointment is next week...
1951860 1953280 We will begin immediately.
1953360 1955290 Excuse me, sir. Komarov has escaped.
1956240 1958320 I'll call you back. There is a problem with Komarov.
1958370 1959240 What happened?
1959700 1961220 Some sort of attack on the courthouse.
1961540 1962630 Who took him?
1962710 1963710 They don't know yet.
1964170 1965540 What do you mean you don't know?
1965960 1966460 Eh...
1966790 1968260 ...well it's confusing...
1968750 1971300 Eyewitnesses say they saw Komarov...
1972550 1974020 ...with an American.
1975510 1977480 What American?
1980390 1982440 John McClane.
1984770 1985990 Let's go.
1989110 1990360 After you.
1991490 1993910 Yeah, I got him.<br />Okay, I'm on it.
1994070 1996370 Look, Mike, we had an unexpected delay.<br />I'm sorry.
1996450 1997500 I understand.
1997570 1999790 This is the last guy on earth<br />I expected to see.
1999950 2002310 Listen to me, Yuri, you have<br />half of Moscow looking for you.
2002410 2004130 I need you to get dressed.<br />Why am I here?
2004290 2007010 Please put on these clothes.<br />Trust me.
2007170 2009300 This is the key to your cuffs.<br />Take these.
2009460 2010710 Oh, my Jesus.
2010880 2012350 Are you okay?<br />What?
2012510 2014930 Do you have<br />the file on Chagarin?
2016640 2018390 This is what you<br />been doing, Jack?
2019140 2020230 Spy shit?
2022640 2024110 This is it?
2024270 2027240 (LAUGHING)<br />You're a spy? Oh, my God.
2029610 2032780 The 007 of Plainfield,<br />New Jersey.
2033400 2034620 Very nice.
2034780 2036830 McClane, shut up.
2037200 2038700 Take it easy, Oddjob.
2038870 2040710 I'm on vacation.
2040870 2042210 Your mom will be pleased.
2042370 2044170 We thought you were<br />doing drugs or something.
2044330 2045380 Mr. Komarov.
2045500 2048090 Or selling drugs,<br />but that was me, really.
2048790 2051470 Do you have<br />the file on Chagarin?
2051880 2053600 Yes, or no?
2055510 2056850 It's very simple, Yuri.
2056970 2059220 You give me the file,<br />and I get you out of Russia.
2059930 2062810 And you're a free man.<br />What do you say?
2065520 2068940 It's not about me.<br />I don't care about my life.
2070560 2071660 Well, that's the deal.
2071820 2073110 It's the only deal.
2074110 2076110 Come on.
2077110 2079830 Come on, Yuri. Help yourself.
2080660 2082030 What's it gonna be?
2083790 2085910 Yes or no?
2086080 2088880 The clock is ticking, Yuri.<br />Come on.
2090040 2091920 You will get me out of here?
2092090 2093180 Only the three of you?
2093340 2095560 Whoa, Nijinsky.<br />I'm not in the gang.
2095710 2098010 I just got off the plane.<br />I'm still jet-lagged.
2098170 2101050 I'm not involved in this.<br />Huh, Jack?
2103810 2106270 Only if I can take<br />my daughter with me.
2109730 2111860 Chagarin's people<br />will kill her.
2114190 2116320 Fine. Make it quick.
2117530 2118530 Ah.
2118610 2119990 Where's the file?
2121030 2123910 It's in a vault in Prypiat, but<br />the key is here in Moscow.
2124080 2125200 At Hotel Ukraina.
2126660 2127660 Shit.
2128830 2132680 Make your call. We're going<br />to the Ukraina, let's go.

2277770 2279190 What are you doing?
2280690 2281690 Jack.
2281780 2283700 Calm down, Yuri, okay?<br />You're gonna be just fine.
2283780 2286580 Here, put this on, stay warm.
2288530 2291210 What was that, John? Five minutes?<br />Five minutes?
2291370 2293090 You blew a three-year op<br />in five minutes!
2293240 2294880 You're welcome!<br />What do you want me to do?
2296920 2299130 Unbelievable.
2299290 2302390 I'm so fucking burned. I got no<br />friends in this town anymore.
2302550 2305390 What about your people at Langley?<br />Just give them a call.
2305550 2307800 Give me your phone.
2310010 2311640 (PHONE SHATTERS)
2315560 2317730 It's a two-year contract<br />on that phone.
2317890 2320070 What are you carrying?<br />Give me that.
2322070 2323690 All right.<br />You got any cash on you?
2324780 2326370 Some American money.
2326530 2328950 What are you talking about?<br />We need to keep on moving.
2329410 2332750 We have to get this guy to a doctor.<br />To medical attention, Jack.
2332910 2333910 The mission stands.
2334120 2336460 Your mission is<br />bleeding out over there.
2336620 2338750 The mission continues.<br />We go to the hotel.
2342590 2346140 Come on, let's move.<br />Let's move.
2357770 2358940 This is nuts.
2359230 2360820 What, are you going to go out<br />and kill somebody else now?
2360980 2362730 Why all this trouble<br />for just one guy?
2362940 2364660 He's a political prisoner.
2365230 2366330 Not that you care, John,
2366480 2368780 but it's a matter of national<br />security, all right?
2368950 2372420 He's got the goods to stop Viktor<br />Chagarin, and we need that to happen.
2372570 2373620 Well, great, Jack.
2373780 2375660 Let's drop him off at the<br />Embassy, and we can go home.
2375830 2378330 Are you kidding me? After what<br />happened at the safe house?
2379660 2381010 Look, it doesn't work<br />like that, all right?
2381170 2383290 It's a huge diplomatic mess,<br />and I'm a burnable asset.
2383330 2386130 So, I now need that file<br />to un-fuck this mission.
2386340 2387430 Any more questions?
2387590 2389010 Yeah, just one.
2389170 2391300 How come you never called<br />and told me where you were?
2391970 2393470 Like you'd give a shit.
2411740 2412790 Shit.
2413320 2415120 Well, we're not going in the front door.
2425250 2427250 All right, hold up, hold up.
2431050 2434350 Okay, Yuri, listen to me, all right?<br />We're almost done.
2434890 2437010 As soon as we get that key,<br />we're gonna grab the file,
2437220 2439220 get you and your daughter<br />out of Russia, all right?
2439390 2440690 All right.
2442020 2445860 Listen to me, you're doing good.<br />All right?
2446020 2448340 I need you to hang here a second.<br />Keep an eye on him, John.
2448440 2449570 Hey, hey.
2449730 2453360 What is it with all this "John" shit?<br />Whatever happened to "Dad?"
2454030 2455700 Good question.
2458870 2461590 In Russia, we have<br />word for men like him.
2462370 2463870 "Krutoi."
2464790 2467970 It means "tough,"<br />"hard."
2468130 2471470 In America, it means<br />"juvenile delinquent."
2473550 2475640 Is he your only child?
2477220 2480060 No. I got a daughter, too.
2480890 2483110 You?
2485980 2488820 I have only my Solnyschka.
2489570 2492990 When she was little,<br />I was working all the time.
2493900 2496910 I believed work was<br />all that mattered.
2502330 2504830 I screwed my<br />kid's life up, too.
2505080 2506080 You work all the time
2506170 2509090 around the clock most of the<br />time, when you're a cop.
2509500 2514930 I just thought that working all the<br />time was a good thing, you know?
2520930 2522430 I didn't help him at all.
2525520 2527440 It's never too late,
2528770 2529940 I hope.
2532940 2534790 Okay, let's go.
2544450 2546930 All right, Yuri, which part of<br />the building is the ballroom in?
2546960 2547960 Main tower.
2548120 2549670 Main tower.<br />Which floor?
2549790 2552470 Top floor.
2552590 2553590 What about security?
2553670 2555510 You remember any guards?<br />Cameras? Anything like that?
2555670 2557550 I don't know.
2557720 2559220 Well, I need you to remember.
2559390 2561390 I was in prison for five<br />years, how should I know?
2561640 2563360 Everything could have changed.<br />I know.
2563510 2566190 Just think, all right?<br />Picture it in your head.
2567020 2568990 The ballroom was closed in '89.
2569150 2571150 I think it's under<br />construction now.
2571480 2572900 JACK: So that floor's<br />unsecured.
2573070 2575360 KOMAROV: I don't know! Listen!<br />My daughter is in there.
2575440 2576700 I'm scared to death, let's go!
2576780 2578330 (WHISTLES)<br />Just calm down, Yuri.

2704280 2706530 We're not really<br />a hugging family.
2706700 2708290 That's right.
2710040 2711500 We just have to get one thing...
2712370 2714290 ...and then we're leaving Moscow for good.
2715120 2715630 OK?
2716130 2716630 OK.
2724550 2725470 Who are they?
2728720 2730520 The young one works for CIA.
2731390 2734140 The old one is his father.<br />Americans.
2735980 2737150 Then thank God for them.
2739320 2741490 There's something<br />no good about this.
2741650 2743030 Just shut up, all right?
2744820 2745910 I'm telling you, Jack,
2746820 2748320 this smells bad.
2750330 2752000 Just stop, okay?
2752330 2756710 This might seem like a totally<br />foreign concept, you know?
2756870 2759170 I know you love to just<br />run in, making shit up.
2759290 2760970 But like any professional,<br />I have a plan.
2761130 2762930 So let's just<br />stick to it, okay?
2763090 2764560 Just move your plan along.
2765130 2766850 All right, Yuri, come on. Let's<br />grab the key, get out of here.
2767010 2768430 Yes.
2769140 2770890 Just take a moment.
2789370 2790370 How you doing?
2792990 2794500 Fine.
2804420 2806220 How did you get<br />over here so quick?
2809590 2810770 Well...

2914740 2915870 What are you doing?
2916580 2918040 It's about money, papa...
2918620 2920120 ...millions of dollars.
2920500 2921790 You think life was easy for me?
2921870 2923800 While you were sitting in prison being a victim?
2924960 2926130 But.
2926290 2928640 I'm your father.
2930630 2932220 And I am your daughter.
2935680 2937930 We should kill the old man now.
2938100 2939440 We still need him.
2939850 2941190 But then you can kill.

4975380 4977380 It was simply bait.
4978220 4980970 What I needed<br />was in this vault.
4981140 4983020 Chagarin was<br />the only one with enough
4983100 4984980 power and influence<br />to get me out of jail.
4985890 4988320 I used him.

4998490 4999740 You want to arrest me?
5002030 5006510 You're out of your jurisdiction,<br />Detective McClane, aren't you?

5689470 5692220 I still ask myself<br />the same question.
5725300 5727100 (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
5731220 5735350 I had a dream last night<br />That I was piloting a plane
5735520 5739020 And all the passengers<br />were drunk and insane
5739150 5742370 I crash landed<br />in a Louisiana swamp
5742440 5745990 Shot up a horde of zombies<br />But I come out on top
5746070 5748200 What's it all about?
5748320 5751620 Guess it just reflects my mood
5753580 5757250 Sitting in the dirt<br />Feeling kind of hurt
5757330 5762840 All I hear is doom and gloom
5764340 5768590 And all is darkness
5768680 5770800 In my room
5771840 5777350 Through the light,<br />your face I see
5779060 5784110 Baby, take a chance Baby,<br />won't you dance with me
5786440 5789700 Lost all that treasure<br />in an overseas war
5789780 5793630 It just goes to show you<br />don't get what you paid for
5793740 5797120 Battle to the rich<br />and you worry about the poor
5797200 5801080 Put my feet up on the couch<br />And lock all the doors
5801170 5802540 What's that funky noise?
5802880 5806600 It's the tightening<br />of the screws
5807960 5811760 Sitting in the dirt<br />Feeling kind of hurt
5811970 5817350 All I hear is doom and gloom
5819350 5822190 But when those drums
5822270 5825150 Go boom, boom, boom
5826360 5829530 Through the night
5829610 5833160 Your face I see
5833530 5839380 Baby, take a chance Baby,<br />won't you dance with me
5841660 5842670 Yeah!
5842960 5847300 Baby, won't you dance with me
5847380 5849100 Ah, yeah
5869440 5873660 Fracking deep for oil But<br />there's nothing in the sump
5873740 5877370 There's kids all picking<br />at the garbage dump
5877450 5881050 I am running out of water<br />so I better prime the pump
5881120 5885300 I am trying to stay sober<br />but I end up drunk
5885380 5890130 We'll be eating dirt Living<br />on the side of the road
5892300 5894140 There's some food for thought
5894220 5897970 Kind of makes your head explode
5899720 5901440 Feeling kind of hurt
5902100 5903270 Yeah!
5903350 5906360 But all I hear
5906480 5909280 Is doom and gloom
5910400 5914750 And all is darkness
5914820 5917170 In my room
5917700 5920830 Through the night
5920910 5924130 Your face I see
5925460 5927710 Baby, take a chance
5928290 5931510 Won't you dance with me
5931920 5933220 Yeah!
