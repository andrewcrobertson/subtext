579371 584501 who could really help you socially and<br />as a result in your career.

658492 664790 This rucks came to my house and pasted<br />on all my things..private things.
664998 667167 Please, make them stop.
672673 674633 Mrs...<br />- Ganush.
676051 681515 Mrs. Ganush, the bank is informing you,<br />they intend to repossess your property...
681557 683433 ..at 325 Brandon Street today
683475 686395 But that is my house for 30 years.
687771 692192 And I make every payment, until this<br />sickness took my eye.
692818 696780 I hope to have more money soon, I just<br />need a little more time.
696905 700200 I don't think my manager's gonna<br />extend you anymore credit
701910 706165 Please,<br />won't you try?
710627 713422 Ok.<br />- Bless u.
714673 715883 Bless u.
721972 725642 We have an elderly woman, asking for an<br />extension on her mortgage payments.
725934 729188 She's on a fixed income and<br />she had some medical problems.
729396 731481 There got to be something we can do<br />to help her.
739531 742618 Well, apparently we already granted<br />her two extensions.
742910 746580 And you know, in these kind of foreclosure<br />we seize the trapped aqua-date.
746622 749041 And the bank makes a sizeable<br />amount in fees.
749416 751126 We have to throw her<br />out of her house?
751752 753003 It's a tough decision.
754880 756381 Your call.
781573 783283 I will take care of it.
803428 804304 Mrs Ganush...
804721 806223 I'm sorry, Mrs. Ganush.
806265 809393 But another extension on<br />the loan is out of the question
809434 811270 What?<br />- I would like to help,
811311 814648 but it isn't...<br />- No..Please, this is my house.
814898 816859 Where would I live?
817442 819236 You used your granddaughter<br />as reference
819278 820320 Maybe you could stay with her?
820445 822281 I would not burden her.
823073 826034 And there are several fine,<br />living facilities...
826076 831165 A nursing home?<br />No, I would never live in one of those places.
832416 834168 I really sorry.
860027 862779 I'm..proud woman with<br />this problem
863113 866283 And never ever begged for anything.
868118 871538 But now, I beg infront you..
871663 874958 I humble..I can sit for you..<br />- Mrs. Ganush, please stand up.
875000 878378 I pray for you, on my mother's grave...
878629 881632 I beg you<br />- Please, let go, let go!
881632 883759 Security!<br />Stop!
885511 887804 Over here,Billy. Over here.<br />- I'm coming.
897439 900567 You..shamed me...
909034 912955 I beg you and you shamed me
914748 916792 I think your business is<br />finished here, ma'am.
917334 918377 Let's go.
924716 925968 Mrs Ganush...
937521 939648 It's alright, ma'am.<br />Let's go!
945821 948198 I never saw anything quite like<br />that before.
949199 950117 You okay?
952536 954538 You handled that just right, you know?
966133 968385 Good night!<br />See you tomorrow.
972306 975309 You know, I just finished going over<br />this McPherson loan.
975350 977394 This is very impressive work.
977603 978395 Thanks.
978687 981315 Would you mind taking this home tonight<br />and finishing it up...
981356 984276 ..because I would like to show to the Regional<br />VP in the morning.
984484 986111 I would love to.<br />- Really?
986361 987529 Thank you.
987738 991491 Oh, and as far as that Asst. Manager's<br />position goes..
991992 993702 You're at the top of the list.
1108525 1111904 You've shamed me.
1113488 1115908 You will get what you deserve!
1233483 1235402 I beat you, you bitch!
1311812 1313647 Soon it will be you!
1313772 1315816 You will come begging to me.
1357024 1358859 We asked to send some officers over<br />to talk with her,
1358901 1360277 She's not gonna bother you anymore.
1360319 1361653 Incase, don't even think about her.
1361778 1363071 And I'm gonna call Mr. Jacks and...
1363238 1365491 Just make sure he walks you to<br />your car every night, ok ?
1365949 1366825 - Ok.
1367951 1372080 You say, you're okay.<br />You're okay, right?
1372372 1373540 I'm fine.
1374833 1377377 What, what's the matter?
1378587 1383091 It's just that..may be I could have got<br />her another extension.
1383133 1384676 Chris, no,<br />don't do that.
1384718 1387596 You said, the bank granted this woman<br />two extensions already, right?
1387930 1389932 I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage<br />you will loose your house...
1389973 1392059 what's this woman expect?<br />It's not your fault.
1392726 1394728 Can't beat yourself up over it.
1419711 1422464 What is it?<br />What's wrong?
1422506 1424091 Did you hear that?
1424091 1425092 - What?
1425926 1427553 Really? You didn't?
1428762 1430973 - No, what?
1434726 1436311 I know this is gonna sound weird,
1436311 1438438 but I wanna get my fortune, right!
1440357 1443026 Now, are you kidding?
1444486 1447197 Come on Chris,<br />I read your fortune for you.
1447406 1450784 Eh..in the near future, we gonna<br />get in the car, go home & relax.
1450784 1451910 I really need to do this.
1452786 1454830 Why, because of what happened<br />with that woman?
1455497 1458333 Chris, I really think we should just<br />get to home now.
1460377 1462087 Can you do this for me?
1470679 1472723 Pray to god,<br />none of my students see me here...
1474558 1478520 Only class I'll be able to teach,like,<br />hypocracy one on one.
1480981 1482691 So many things to choose from here,
1482733 1484359 unfortunately not one am looking for...
1484401 1485986 ..which is a weird little dried monkey head.
1486153 1488280 Oh, wait, never mind!<br />He's got one.
1491408 1494244 I'm Rham Jas.<br />Seer.
1494411 1496288 I'm Christine,<br />and this is Clay.
1496497 1498415 You probaly already knew that, right?
1500792 1501960 Just kidding.
1502961 1506006 How can I help you?<br />- I would like have my fortune, right?
1506215 1507925 Can you do that?
1507966 1510427 - I have the abilities to see<br />certain energies.
1510511 1514014 Sometimes these energies, are foretell<br />to things to come.
1514056 1515641 $60, please.
1515682 1517684 - Seriously?<br />- Yes.
1517726 1518685 60...
1519269 1521146 Doesn't that seem little cheap<br />for this weird thing?
1521480 1525150 If your not serious...<br />Please, go.
1525192 1526443 Alright.<br />C'mon, Chris.
1526610 1527778 Wait, wait, I'll pay.
1527819 1531490 Oh, you know what,<br />I got it.
1531532 1533158 I got it.
1534910 1537246 Platinum card, very good.
1542417 1543836 Thank you.
1544461 1546505 Here, here.<br />- Thanks.
1550467 1551802 Ah..ah, please.
1555514 1558267 So, you wish to know something about<br />your destiny?
1558308 1559268 - Yes.
1559309 1561311 Very good, lets see what the fate<br />has in store!
1561353 1563647 You know, Freud said destiny was not<br />a act of fate...
1563689 1567150 But rather s'thing created by subconscious to<br />control our conscious choices.
1567317 1568861 That's true!
1568902 1572155 But we cannot attempt to understand<br />the world, by intellect alone.
1572197 1574700 Oh, Karl Jung.<br />- Yes.
1575325 1578328 From his teachings,<br />"Psycological Types"
1578370 1579329 So...
1579454 1581915 Jung, new-age's favourite psychologist.
1581957 1584209 - Because he wasn't afraid to bring God<br />into the equation
1584251 1586170 Wow! He wasn't afraid to bring God...
1586211 1589214 Clay, Clay..c'mon !<br />- Ok, I know..c'mon, let's start
1589214 1589965 Shall we?
1590007 1591717 I'm ready.<br />- Ok.
1592009 1595262 Please, give me your hand<br />- Okay.
1603645 1605230 You work with money.
1606356 1607608 That's right.
1608901 1610819 And you recently lost something?
1613030 1615782 No,<br />No, I don't think so.
1615824 1618327 - No..no,<br />you haven't lost anything...
1620120 1622623 but something has been taken<br />from you.
1623457 1624708 No.
1625375 1627252 A button.<br />- Oh my God.
1627461 1628504 Yes.
1629213 1630923 Why would he say she's missing<br />a button, so what?
1631048 1632216 Clay, this was really strange!
1632257 1634635 The old woman from today, she took<br />a button from my sleeve.
1634676 1638222 Why would she do that?<br />- You both, please be just quiet?
1711086 1713088 I think that's enough for tonight.
1713130 1714298 What's wrong?
1714548 1717551 I'm tired and I see it's<br />become quite late.
1717885 1720804 I will of course refund your money.<br />- Wait, wait ...
1721054 1722598 Did you see something?
1724057 1726977 A dark spirit has come upon you.<br />- What do you mean?
1727144 1729438 Oh, you...<br />- You...the dead or visiting the graveyard?
1729521 1730522 No.
1730564 1733358 - You play the Ouija board or sort with<br />who practise the black art?
1733400 1735527 Alright, take it easy,man. C'mon!<br />No, Wait..wait.
1735527 1736528 No, no..I didn't!
1737654 1740157 Perhaps, someone has cursed you.
1745913 1747915 Then how did he know all that?
1747956 1750042 Know what?<br />Did you lost a button?
1751210 1752503 By the way, he didn't really<br />know that much,
1752544 1754046 He makes a couple of good guesses...
1754087 1757424 He stirs you up and leaves you<br />all these questions.
1757508 1760385 And conveniently, his business card.
1760636 1763263 Come on, Chris.<br />He's a scam artist.
1763430 1766433 But he didn't want the money, he tried<br />to give it back, remember?
1767017 1770395 Well, he sorta tried. But in the end<br />he took it, didn't?
1773482 1774900 I guess so.
1799007 1801343 I gotta go tow in the car,<br />you gonna be ok?
1801343 1802636 Yeah.<br />- Alright?
1802678 1805639 Kitty, care for her.<br />- I'm see you in an hour.
2035244 2036954 Here, put that on your lip.<br />- Thank you.
2036995 2038580 I can't beleive she came to the house.
2038622 2040499 This is so nasty..<br />I'm calling the cops
2040541 2043252 It wasn't her<br />- Who was it then?
2043502 2045796 I don't know, I couldn't see<br />who was.
2045838 2047339 Ofcourse, it's her.<br />Had to be her.
2047381 2049383 No, Clay.<br />It wasn't anyone.
2049424 2051510 It was somebody<br />Chris, there had to be somebody
2051552 2053262 The lights were out, so I couldn't see<br />who it was but I guess...
2053303 2055681 Clay, there wasn't anybody here.
2056473 2058308 Then, who did this?
2059726 2061854 Who...<br />Who hit you in the face?
2068861 2072281 I think, it's just reaction of her being<br />attacked earlier in the day.
2072322 2074741 - Yeah, classic symptoms of<br />post-traumatic stress.
2074783 2078078 - Yeah, she showing signs of panicking,<br />apparently yeah, so...
2078078 2080747 Let me walk you out.<br />- No, no, no...I'm fine.
2080789 2081832 - Alright.
2088672 2091091 How you doing?<br />- Better.
2091383 2093510 Especially after the doctor explained<br />it to me.
2093552 2097514 He..he said that victims of violence,<br />they re-experience trauma
2098056 2101643 I misinterpreted it to be something<br />more than it was.
2102144 2103228 It happens.
2104313 2106732 I just.., I feel...
2107733 2111028 kind of embarrassed.<br />- Are you kidding? No...
2111153 2112946 You never have to be embarrassed<br />with me.
2121788 2125876 Listen, I was thinking may be we could<br />take a little trip on saturday
2125918 2127878 Get on the train and go<br />to Santa Barbara.
2127920 2130005 Your folks cabin?<br />- Yeah, if you aren't afraid of the cabin
2130047 2132382 Oh, my God..I would love to!<br />Yeah, okay.
2132466 2135093 That would be so exciting.<br />- Oh baby, you gonna love it.
2135135 2135886 You gonna love it.
2135928 2137596 I'll make sure you see this trees..<br />and...
2137638 2140474 It's private, it would be great,<br />it would be good...
2140516 2144019 And I think we need to..we can..<br />We can just talk.
2145771 2147147 or...fuck!
2272648 2273774 What?
2275275 2276276 What's wrong?
2276902 2278654 I couldn't...<br />I couldn't wake up!
2280239 2282991 It's ok, ok.<br />Come here.
2283283 2284576 It's just a dream.
2297256 2299633 Oh baby, that's the rent-a-car, they<br />dropped off this morning.
2300008 2301844 - Thanks<br />Sure.
2302469 2304596 I love you<br />- I love you too.
2306557 2311019 Hey baby...try not to piss off<br />any old ladies today, ok.
2329830 2332666 Hey, Christine. What...<br />you just getting here?
2332708 2334001 What you the hour monitor?
2334042 2336378 Haha, very funny, Christine.
2336420 2338255 Oh, What's this?
2339506 2340674 What do you want?
2340883 2343635 I'm here to finish me teaching<br />the loan procedures.
2346138 2348599 I have got a lot on my mind.<br />Can we do this tommorrow?
2348891 2350350 - Sure.<br />Okay.
2350392 2353353 I will just tell Mr.Jacks, you don't have<br />the time right now. Maybe...
2353562 2356398 No, no.<br />Ok, I'll do it.
2356523 2357691 Ok.
2359485 2362112 We were going over the asset based<br />lending guidelines.
2362488 2363363 - Alrite.
2363822 2368160 Let's say your client is a company that<br />can't get traditional bank financing.
2378754 2381298 And?<br />- And...
2386220 2390307 And?<br />- And...
2393352 2397022 Hey, get your filthy pig knuckles<br />off my desk!
2404780 2407616 Christine...blood!<br />Brown.
2408075 2410869 Christine...your nose.
2411495 2413872 Yeah, sure...can you hold?
2414748 2418210 Here, let me help you<br />- No, it's going outta control.
2419294 2420629 What is with you?
2421588 2423423 Mr. Jacks?<br />Did I get any in my mouth?
2423465 2424925 Oh, my God!<br />Did I get any in my mouth?
2425425 2427344 Let me check & get you cleaned.
2427594 2431056 I'm so sorry!<br />Oh, my God!
2431390 2433392 What was that about?<br />It's just a nose bleed.
2433767 2435352 Did I get any in my mouth?
2490199 2491575 What is it?
2495621 2498874 Hi, I came to see Sylvia Ganush,<br />is she here?
2499249 2500459 Who are you?
2501418 2504338 I am...a friend of hers.
2505130 2506840 Someone...<br />- Wait.
2509676 2513222 I know who you are!<br />Grandma told me, you would come.
2513805 2516767 You're the woman from the bank.<br />The one who took her out
2517184 2520729 Actually it was the bank that took the house.<br />I..I mean, I just work there.
2521355 2524942 Infact, I tried to help your grandma<br />get the house back.
2524942 2526485 But my boss wouldn't let me.
2526735 2530489 Are you gonna stand here on my porch<br />and lie to my face?
2535828 2536829 No.
2537538 2540332 You used to be a real fat girl,<br />didn't you?
2546588 2549007 Ya<br />- I can tell.
2550384 2551969 You're not welcome here.
2552886 2557474 Wait...I need to see her,<br />I need her to forgive me.
2557891 2559476 And I'll get her the house back.
2559518 2561937 And you gonna make everything alright<br />for her, is that it?
2561979 2562980 Yes.
2564898 2566191 Come on.
2580831 2582082 Where is she?
2634468 2637846 Get off me!<br />Get off me!
2653946 2656949 Still gonna make everything alright<br />for her?
2658492 2661203 You deserve everything that's coming to!
2670003 2672965 I beleive what plagues you is Lamia
2673006 2675342 Lamia, that's the word the old woman used.
2675384 2676510 "The Black Goat"
2676468 2679721 Only summoned by the Gypsies<br />for their darkest deeds.
2679972 2682099 For the first 3 Days, the Lamia appears as a...
2682140 2684685 ..nasty spirit that torments it's victim.
2685269 2688438 After that it reveals itself to be a<br />taker of souls.
2688480 2690899 And comes for the owner of<br />the cursed object.
2690983 2692651 Cursed object?<br />What object?
2692651 2695904 Something taken from the victim,<br />cursed and given back.
2700117 2701368 This?
2703370 2704746 What if I just burn it?
2704788 2708458 Am afraid, no matter what condition<br />the button is in,
2708500 2710085 You would still be the owner.
2710127 2713130 Alamia would still come to take you<br />- Take me where?
2720179 2722014 Then how do I get rid of this?
2722055 2724308 You could attempt to appease the spirit
2724641 2726560 The simplest way would be a blood offering.
2726810 2730355 A small creature could be sacrified.<br />Ah..a chicken perhaps...
2730397 2731565 No way!
2731607 2733150 Look, I'm a vegetarian.
2733192 2735402 I volunteered..<br />it's a puppy shelter for Christ's sake!
2735569 2737696 I'm not going around killing animals!
2737738 2739865 You will be surprised,<br />what you'll be willing to do...
2739907 2741617 ..when Lamia comes for you.
2744703 2746288 This will show you, how.
2762513 2763514 Hi!
2987659 2989661 Here, Kitty, Kitty.
3011140 3012934 Here, Kitty, Kitty.
3024737 3026447 Chris.<br />Chris?
3027573 3028700 Chris?
3031160 3033913 Hey, there you are!<br />What you doing out here?
3034080 3035456 Baby, I called the bank and they said<br />you left early...
3035498 3036916 And your not answering my calls!
3037542 3039127 Is that blood?
3041879 3044841 No!<br />Why would there be blood?
3044882 3047844 Baby, there's blood on your sleeve.
3047927 3051848 Oh, no...it was just tomato juice.
3051889 3055893 I was cutting tomato in the kitchen and<br />it must have gotten on my sleeve.
3058730 3063401 Hey Chris, Why don't we do<br />this dinner another time?
3063609 3066279 You had a rough couple of days,<br />I feel it's better.
3066321 3070033 No, I..I want to go to the dinner.<br />- I know, but...
3070158 3072035 You sure, you feeling alright?
3073494 3076539 Honestly..I haven't been.
3082337 3086841 But I think...I think everything's<br />gonna be ok now.
3089260 3090928 I really do.
3095850 3097060 What do you think?
3100813 3102315 You look beautiful.
3106152 3108488 Gosh, it's such a nice day.<br />- Ya, it really is.
3108696 3110740 Would be nice inside too.
3114160 3115411 They gonna love you.
3118790 3121000 Clay! Hi, mother!<br />Good to see you.
3121000 3122794 This is Christine<br />this is my mom, Trudy.
3122835 3126631 Hello, Christine. - Hello.<br />It's very nice to meet you.
3127548 3129634 Please, come in.<br />Come in.
3130468 3133012 Hey, Dad! - Hey, son!<br />How are you? Good to see you.
3133221 3136099 This is Christine<br />Christine, this is my dad, Leonard.
3136849 3139560 You have a beautiful home<br />- Oh, thank you very much.
3141104 3142897 Can I get you a drink?<br />- Wine?
3143314 3144190 Sure.
3144565 3147485 Come down.<br />I'll be right back.
3147902 3150113 I'll take a Chardonnay.<br />- Yes, dear.
3151614 3154367 I hope you do not mind.<br />- Oh, how thoughtful.
3154409 3155994 Home-made?<br />- Yes.
3156494 3163209 What type of cake you would call that?<br />- It's called...a Harvest cake.
3163626 3168423 Something...you make in a farm?<br />- No...
3171384 3174095 I mean not anymore,<br />we used to...
3174178 3177974 When we had a gaggle of geese.<br />Geese?
3178057 3179767 Well, right around the harvest time,
3179809 3183354 Thats when the goose eggs will<br />make a real dense yolk..
3183396 3185023 Makes for a rich cake.
3187442 3189694 Well, just...thank you.
3190486 3192488 Hey, here we are..<br />Sorry..
3192905 3194490 Why don't you join us<br />in the dining room?
3194532 3196159 - Yeah, let's go.<br />Ok.
3198328 3200455 Oh, Jesus!<br />Hecuba?
3200997 3203875 Never did understand that damned animal.<br />Hate cats.
3203875 3207253 That is so strange!<br />Hecuba is usually very sweet.
3207545 3209964 Oh, that's okay.<br />I had a cat, I understand.
3211674 3213259 We have a cat.
3215136 3218931 What you mean? It's not like<br />something's happened to him.
3220892 3223019 How am I supposed to now?
3223561 3226064 You know how cats are.<br />They come and they go.
3230151 3231402 That's true.
3233571 3236950 Well, let's...<br />- Yes, yes, please.
3237408 3239285 So how's the coin collection, son?
3239494 3242163 It's my dad's favorite topic.<br />I see, he's still a...
3242664 3243790 Huh!<br />It's good, it's good.
3243831 3247293 Infact, Christine just got me a 1929<br />Standing Liberty quarter at a bank.
3247377 3248294 Really?<br />- Isn't that crazy?
3248336 3249295 That's rare.
3249462 3252632 Oh, I just think that job of bank teller<br />must be so difficult?
3252715 3256260 With all counting and repetition,<br />you must get very tedious.
3256302 3259263 Yes, you're right.<br />But I'm not a teller.
3259305 3262141 Oh? - Yeah mom, I thought<br />I told you, Christine's a loan officier.
3262225 3265436 Handles other loans for small businesses<br />and homes for banks...
3265436 3268773 And she's expecting promotion, so...<br />Right, Chris ?
3269023 3272151 If I can close this one account,<br />I'm working on. It would really help.
3272276 3274153 That must be a very important loan
3274195 3276489 - It's the biggest my branch<br />has ever handled!
3276948 3278533 And how did that come to you?
3280034 3282245 Well, I was reading the<br />Wall Street journal...
3282287 3285832 And came cross this medical supply company<br />that was looking to expand...
3285873 3287458 ..but didn't have the liquidity.
3287667 3290503 So, I met up with their CFO and<br />presented a formula...
3290586 3293089 ..for re-structuring some of their<br />long-term acts.
3293589 3295842 Sounds-like you got luck's going<br />for you, Christine.
3296009 3298219 Well, your mother must be<br />very proud of you.
3299637 3300805 - I suppose.
3306811 3309480 I don't see much of my mother.<br />- Why is that?
3309647 3312442 Well, it's..it's...her personal..
3312483 3313901 I'm speaking to Christine.
3318072 3322785 Well, ever since my dad died,<br />she doesn't talk much...
3323244 3329667 She just stays in the farm and<br />keeps to herself.
3329709 3331711 Because...<br />Because?
3332462 3336049 Because...her husband died, mom,<br />she wants to be by herself.
3336174 3338718 Why don't...<br />- Because my mother is an alcoholic.
3342930 3344641 I'm sorry.
3346225 3349354 It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.
3350063 3352732 I have to say, I find your honesty<br />very refreshing.
3353816 3357278 My father had a drinking problem.<br />I was always too ashamed to admit it.
3358237 3359864 You got backbone.
3360615 3363451 Not like that last girl you brought by.<br />What was her name?
3364285 3365244 - Alice.<br />We don't have to..
3365286 3366245 - Alicia.
3366287 3367956 - Alicia.<br />She was dreadful, Christine.
3368164 3371125 She was ill-mannered, no amibition at all.
3371960 3373836 Well, they met on the internet.<br />- What is that?
3373878 3376047 "They met on the internet", really?<br />What does that mean?
3376089 3378925 May I beat it out of him?<br />- No, not at all.
3378967 3379926 - Thank you very much.
3379968 3385014 You know, I think, I would try some of<br />that cake of yours.
3386724 3391270 You only..you only just like it, if you hate<br />delicious things.
3402657 3404284 Harvest cake, huh?<br />- That's right.
3404784 3406452 Must get this recipe.<br />- Not so sweet, isn't?
3406828 3408371 Did you hear something?
3409122 3411374 - No.<br />You, ok?
3412750 3414794 I like that a lot.<br />- I do like that.
3415712 3419090 And mom, you sure I met her<br />on the Internet?
3419132 3420633 It was bit misleading...
3439611 3441279 You have to find her a mate.
3441696 3444073 You can't even trust things that<br />you hear or...
3444115 3445908 ..people that write about themselves.<br />- Very nice!
3445908 3448411 And pictures are false half the time.<br />Is that true?
3448453 3450747 Ya, it's true..<br />- I don't think it's a misconception..
3450747 3453041 ..to think that people of good breeding<br />and success
3453207 3458671 ..should be able to make potential...<br />in realistic situations, isn't it?
3468014 3469641 Would you, Christine?
3472101 3474687 No, no !<br />Ofcourse, no.
3475063 3478816 But, but..we did, remember the bar, Chris?<br />What you talking about.
3479192 3481319 Oh my God, that's right.<br />- Shit.
3481361 3482654 ...is straight.
3482737 3485990 It's not a...., mom.<br />It's a bar.
3487075 3489077 Yeah, we heard that!<br />- So, met at the bar.
3489327 3491287 We set-up the date on the internet.
3492372 3493456 You, ok?
3494749 3495917 Ok?
3496709 3497835 Here, have some...
3498044 3499504 ....on the wrong plate.
3501214 3502507 Oh, my God!
3513977 3515603 Sorry, I didn't..<br />I din't...
3523987 3526114 Okay, I hear you!
3526197 3529575 Leave me alone,<br />just leave the hell alone!
3529617 3531369 Please, there's no one there.
3537834 3541045 I think I better go.<br />- Yes, I think that would be best.
3542880 3546009 Hey, Chris!<br />- Don't follow her, she's a sick girl.
3546092 3548720 No, she needs my help.<br />- Let her go.
3550471 3551681 Wait!
3552724 3554142 What's the matter?
3555435 3559605 Look, I did what you said!<br />I killed that little kitty.
3559814 3561566 You're so full of shit!
3561607 3564152 These are illusive and powerful forces,<br />we are dealing with.
3564193 3565903 There are no guarantees!
3584297 3587383 You speak directly to the black spirit.
3587592 3590011 You must dissuade it from taking<br />your soul.
3590261 3593514 And soon.<br />I know someone who could help us.
3593765 3595683 And I'm supposed to trust you?
3595975 3600146 Tomorrow is the third day.<br />After that Lamia will come after you.
3600313 3601689 We can't let that happen!
3602815 3605902 But you must understand...<br />the woman who can help us,
3606110 3608571 ..must herself at great risk.
3608613 3610281 She will not do that for free.
3610657 3612241 What you need from me?
3612408 3614953 $10,000...cash.
3615787 3617246 By tomorrow.
3631135 3633554 Mr. Jacks?<br />Ya.
3633680 3635390 This is kinda awkward of me
3635431 3637433 And I know it's not officially apt.
3638810 3642313 But I was wondering if I could get an<br />advance for the new position.
3642313 3644565 - What the..the Asst. Manager's position?
3645024 3648695 - Yes. See one of my family members<br />is really sick.
3649404 3652365 They're not gonna die..but they could..<br />- Christine..Christine!
3652907 3654117 There is a problem.
3654117 3657078 The McPherson deal was cancelled<br />last night.
3657287 3658997 - What?<br />Ya.
3659539 3663042 Right after I informed the Regional Office that<br />we had this big loan handing..
3663126 3666129 I find out, they just made the deal over,<br />with First National!
3666754 3669549 I gotten into a call to see what<br />excatly happened..but...
3669716 3673678 Right now, this does not look too good<br />for you or for me.
3674429 3679559 So this Asst. Manager's promotion<br />has been delayed.
3679767 3682603 Infact you know, I think with everything<br />that's been happening,
3682645 3685815 I think, I'm gonna have to give<br />this job to Stu.
3686899 3689360 Stu...?<br />I see.
3689694 3692322 I'm sorry, look,<br />if you got family problems...
3692322 3695366 may be you should take the day off,<br />sort them out and...
3763309 3764769 So, how much?
3764894 3768648 $3800 for everything.<br />- Including my jewellery?
3768773 3769941 - Including!
3769983 3772110 But this stuff is worth so much<br />more than that!
3772694 3776864 Please?<br />This is all I have, I'm begging you.
3777865 3779659 Take it or leave it!
3789002 3791379 Chris?<br />Chris...?
3794048 3795258 Baby?
3814652 3816946 I thought, you relax for sometime, alright?
3818281 3823411 I'm...thought I screwed it,<br />I'm eating ice cream.
3827123 3829125 I paid Rham Jas.
3832587 3836382 - What?<br />You kidding me?
3836633 3837925 I paid him.
3838509 3841471 - Why? I mean,<br />I thought that you didn't beleive.
3842388 3845058 I..I don't know<br />what I beleive in anymore.
3845391 3849854 I really don't...but..<br />I know you beleive in this
3849979 3853733 I know, how important is this<br />to you and...
3853775 3855944 ..I know how much pain this is<br />causing you.
3857153 3860531 And, uhh...and also remembered,
3861574 3866913 I remember a promise that I made,<br />That I fell in love with you.
3867747 3869916 I told myself that..I would...
3870750 3875004 I would always look out for you<br />and always would take care of you.
3876130 3877882 So, I paid him.
3881260 3884305 You remember the night,<br />you fell in love with me?
3884347 3886599 I rememeber, every second of that.
3888893 3890603 Oh, my God.
3903366 3905618 You sure, you don't want me to<br />go in with you?
3905702 3907203 - He said, I should come alone.
3907245 3910164 - Yeah, I know-I know,<br />he told me the same thing.
3946868 3949829 Christine, if you would be,<br />the pleasure with introduction,
3949954 3951247 Shaun San Dena!
3955335 3957879 Welcome!<br />- How do you do?
3958755 3960882 Shaun San Dena's a experienced medium
3960923 3963926 By the more, she's personally even<br />touched the Lamia!
3964385 3967555 I first encountered this spirit,<br />many years ago...
3967889 3969307 ..in this very house.
3969807 3972518 And..what happened?
3973645 3977357 - I lost a young boy's soul...
3977732 3979025 ..to the beast!
3984072 3988284 I have waited, these long years,
3988785 3992580 ..for a chance at redeeming myself.
3992997 3996793 A chance to destory the foul thing.<br />And...
3996834 3999420 It's time to go,<br />Please?
4003925 4007595 Tonight,<br />my chance will come!
4008262 4012350 But to summon it,<br />I will need your help.
4013351 4015561 Can you be strong?
4017981 4019274 - I will try.
4024320 4027615 My late hushand, Sandok,<br />was also a medium.
4027782 4031035 He choose this site to build the house<br />upon because..
4031119 4034080 ..he felt, certain forces of the<br />world are here.
4034998 4040878 At this place, there is a particular..<br />confluence...
4047385 4049679 A particular confluence of forces which...
4049721 4053099 ..allows a doorway to be opened through<br />which we may pass.
4057228 4060189 And through which,<br />others may pass into our world.
4065945 4068072 Please, be seated.
4096392 4097560 What's going on?
4097602 4100563 - Everything we doing is for your own good.<br />Please...
4101481 4103816 Christine..<br />please.
4108237 4109656 Thank you.
4128967 4134180 Holy Spirit...<br />Bless us!
4140186 4144107 Once the spirit has entered me,<br />put my hand upon the animal.
4144649 4147860 Do you understand?<br />- Yes.
4147902 4150989 I'll force the spirit of Lamia,<br />into the goat.
4151489 4154909 Milos, that's when you strike.<br />- Yes, I'll do that.
4154993 4156995 You strike it hard!
4157036 4158621 I understand.
4169507 4171509 We all must be receptive!
4186399 4187859 What am I supposed to do?
4187984 4190278 You must allow the darkness in!
4190445 4193531 You must invite the dead,<br />to come into your spirit!
4194490 4197660 I'm scared!<br />- Yes.
4197744 4199329 Now, repeat these words.
4199829 4202540 I welcome the dead...<br />into my soul!
4206294 4209922 I welcome the dead into my soul!<br />- You must beleive it!
4210715 4213676 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4215094 4218806 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4218973 4222310 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4222518 4225688 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4225730 4229025 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4229067 4232320 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4232362 4236366 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4237742 4240578 We're waiting holy spirits,<br />are you with us?
4240620 4243790 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4243831 4245792 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4245833 4247418 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4247418 4248586 I welcome the dead into my..
4252423 4255301 Something else is here with us.
4255927 4257720 Yes.
4285957 4289460 It is not Lamia!<br />It is...
4290128 4293715 The spirit of someone..<br />Lost it's soul...
4293881 4295508 ..from years ago.
4295883 4299178 Sometimes they settle once<br />and linger by the door!
4299846 4303016 There are others here, as well.
4313276 4317071 Speak out, spirit!<br />Speak out!
4329751 4331878 He is coming!
4434606 4437775 He now inhibits the body of<br />Shaun San Dena!
4441404 4446993 Lamia-a-a-a-a!
4450747 4452749 Lamia, what is it,<br />you desire?
4452790 4457170 I desire, the soul of Christine Brown!
4457462 4460798 We will feast upon it,<br />while she festers in the grave!
4461257 4464344 No, it was my manager Jim Jacks,<br />He was the one...
4464385 4465553 Silence!
4465803 4470016 Lamia, sure you can be dissuaded from taking<br />this insignificant woman.
4470141 4472935 Sure, she is not worthy of her greatness!
4481861 4483571 No!
4487450 4491537 I come for you, Christine.
4492956 4494540 You are mine!
4499587 4504968 No...you tricked me,<br />you black-hearted who-o-o-o-ore!
4505051 4506344 Now, Milos...now!
4506386 4507345 You bitch-h-h!
4520817 4522735 Away, I say, evil spirit!
4538960 4540128 Lamia!
4540503 4542130 I was the one who summoned you,<br />into this circle.
4542380 4544382 I command you to leave,<br />this instance!
4547510 4550013 She has great chest!
4551806 4553933 Christine-e-e-e!
4559480 4564402 I don't want your cat,<br />you dirty, little whore queen!
4575622 4580001 Shaun San Dena!<br />You must banish the spirit!
4580376 4581461 Yes.
4613451 4614577 Milos?
4615536 4616829 Oh, my God!
4617372 4619415 I'm ok.<br />- My God.
4619499 4621668 I'm ok.<br />- Oh, my God.
4624295 4626673 You did it.<br />- Thank, God.
4628299 4631219 I tried...<br />- Are you ok?
4631511 4633721 Oh, my God!<br />Help me!
4638351 4639936 Call the ambulance.
4643940 4645483 Is she breathing?
4647151 4648319 - No!
4651698 4653116 Oh, God.
4694574 4697619 It's so sad.<br />- Yes.
4697660 4699621 It's strange, how things work out.
4699871 4704292 She waited 40 years for another chance,<br />to overcome the Lamia.
4705918 4711299 And finally, on the last night of her life,<br />she did!
4711382 4713676 No, I'm afraid you misunderstand!
4714969 4717764 Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.
4718014 4720850 This is our lesson, tonight!<br />I'm sorry.
4721184 4722894 But I saw her get rid of that thing.
4722936 4727357 - No, you saw her drive it from the seance.<br />That is all.
4727398 4730360 He will be back.<br />The goat was never slaughtered.
4731444 4734113 This night is through...
4734197 4738034 Lamia will come for the owner of<br />the cursed object.
4741245 4743957 Unless, ofcourse,<br />if you're no longer the owner.
4744082 4745291 Here, the button.
4754175 4758471 Give a gift to, then<br />you have given the curse away.
4761641 4763434 Why didn't you tell me this before?
4763476 4766980 Because Lamia will tear the soul of<br />whoever you give that to.
4767146 4769148 They'll burn in hell for eternity.
4771192 4777156 And I would have send them there!<br />- I, your accomplice!
4778366 4783246 Whatever you decide,<br />left a warning.
4803641 4805226 Is it over?
4806311 4807895 - It's over.
4817030 4819490 You'll burn in hell!
4819699 4824412 You'll burn in hell!<br />- You bitch, you will burn in hell!
4824621 4826456 Your time's coming!
4826998 4828458 You'll burn in hell!
4828458 4830084 You ok?
4830501 4832378 Oh, shit!
4846809 4848603 You sure, yourself ok with the<br />San Barbara trip? - Ya.
4848645 4849395 Ya?<br />- I'm fine.
4849479 4851064 And what..what time should I get you?
4851105 4853358 - It's better, if I meet you at the station.
4853524 4855526 There's something, I got to do on the way.
4855568 4857153 - I can do it, lemme do it on the way...
4857278 4859822 - No, no, I got it under control.
4860448 4863242 Meet you up at 07.30...<br />Wait, where's my envelope?
4863284 4865703 What envelope?<br />- It was in my purse, I just had it.
4866245 4868414 It's just an envelope!<br />- No, it's gotta be here!
4868456 4870458 If it's here, we will find it eventually.
4871626 4874462 Oh, my God,<br />I thought I lose it!
4874879 4875755 Ok!
4876839 4878758 07.30, don't be late!
4916170 4918214 Are you sure,<br />you don't want anything else?
4918464 4919382 - No.
4919424 4922218 - So you're just gonna sit here,<br />drinking coffee on your own?
4922552 4925930 - Yes.<br />May be..what is it to you?
4925972 4929851 Honey, I'm earning my money on tips.<br />Coffee drinkers don't tip!
4929976 4934147 Honey, just keep the coffee coming and<br />I'll give you a tip, you won't forget.
4976105 4978608 Oh, my gosh,<br />that smells good.
4980485 4982987 Your the sweetest person in the world.
4986199 4988910 Never mind, what's it about, Stu.<br />Just get here in 10 mins or...
4988910 4991537 I gonna tell Mr. Jacks something,<br />you don't me to tell him.
4992455 4995124 - Oh, yeah?<br />About what?
4995166 4998544 Well, for starters, that you stole the McPherson<br />loan file off my desk...
4998586 5000588 ..and gave it to First National!
5000797 5001965 Now, you got 9 minutes!
5006594 5009555 Give me another.<br />- Seriously?
5017647 5020358 Oh God, Christine,<br />please don't betray me.
5020525 5023653 I mean, if my dad finds out...<br />Just tell me what you want?
5023695 5026990 I need to give something to you.<br />A little gift!
5027115 5028408 A gift...?
5030451 5031744 I don't understand!<br />I thought you called me down here...
5031786 5033413 because I gave that loan to<br />First National...
5033496 5035999 Look, you don't need to understand!<br />Just shut up!
5038584 5040295 Now, this gift that I'm giving you...
5040336 5042922 ..will become your property,<br />you will be the owner, alight?
5046259 5047677 - Ok.
5052974 5054225 Ok.
5057854 5059188 What?
5060273 5061024 Forget it.
5063276 5064944 I thought, you wanted to give it to me<br />because of the loan stuff...
5064986 5066654 Just leave!
5069282 5072910 Ok!<br />Thank you so much, Christine.
5078625 5080793 But your not gonna tell my dad, right?
5080793 5081794 Go!<br />- Ok.
5092847 5095141 Who does...this?
5104275 5106945 GANUSH SYLVIA
5115954 5118206 Well, is it possible?
5119207 5122001 There are gypsy blessings,<br />which also works with dead.
5122251 5126506 They give gifts to their departed,<br />very favourite to the deceased soul.
5126631 5128925 But truelly, the soul never dies.
5130927 5134180 Yes, I do beleive you could give<br />the curse...
5134222 5135473 ..to someone who has passed on.
5135848 5138393 But you must give a formal gift,<br />to the cursed object,
5138434 5139477 ..to the deceased.
5138935 5143898 - Oh, I'll do better than that!<br />I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!
5143940 5145525 How many gifts...
5216929 5218222 GANUSH
5252215 5253925 I'm giving it back to you!
5256260 5258179 You gonna take this thing!
5259931 5261849 Are you gonna take this thing?
5265019 5266187 Take it!
5279409 5281828 That's the last of my hair,<br />you're cutting!
5287500 5292964 I, Christine Brown, do hereby,<br />make a formal gift...
5293006 5296134 ..this button, to you, Sylvia Ganush.
5297802 5299804 Choke on it, bitch!
5314569 5316446 Goodbye!
5405952 5408913 Hi, it's Christine, leave a message and<br />I'll call you back.
5409497 5411207 Christine, it's Jim.<br />Jim Jacks.
5411749 5413334 I'm sorry, I'm calling so early...
5413376 5415503 But last night, I found out some<br />troubling information...
5415545 5418339 ..about our friend Stu Rubin.
5418381 5421718 Apparently, he stole your file on<br />the McPherson loan...
5421759 5425096 ..and then tried to broke his own deal<br />with First National.
5425221 5427140 I guess,<br />he thought he wouldn't find out.
5427223 5428933 And we wouldn't have either, except that,
5428975 5433688 An hour ago he came by my house and<br />tried to pin the whole thing on you!
5434355 5438401 After I confronted him about<br />a few inconsistencies in the story...
5438443 5443072 ..he broke down crying, well,<br />we won't be seeing him around anymore.
5443990 5445700 So, I just wanted you to know that,
5445742 5447201 Come, monday morning,
5447243 5450955 ..that Asst. Manager's postion will be<br />waiting for you.
5491913 5492622 Hi!
5492664 5493873 Good morning.
5493998 5497418 I'm sorry. But...<br />- I just...I just want this coat.
5497460 5498753 We are not open yet!
5498753 5500755 My boyfriend and I are taking<br />this really...
5500797 5502507 ..special trip this morning.
5504092 5504968 Please.
5514269 5515144 Hi!
5516020 5517605 Hey, oh!<br />Wo-o-w!
5518231 5519732 Oh God,<br />so glad you are here!
5519774 5520608 So many things I wanna to tell.
5520650 5521818 You wanna listen to something,<br />I have to say?
5521859 5523278 Although I have it straight in my head?
5523319 5525196 - Ok, go right ahead.
5525238 5527532 You never stopped looking out for me.
5528241 5529951 Thank you for that.
