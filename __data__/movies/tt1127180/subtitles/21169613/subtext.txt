385568 389197 I think we can make this work. I'll call<br />you this afternoon and let you know.
389305 390363 - Thank you so much.<br />- Thank you.
390473 392407 - You're welcome.<br />- Thank you.
392808 394070 - Thank you.<br />- Have a great day.
394143 395810 - Yeah, you, too. Have a good day.<br />- Okay.
395811 397472 - Thank you.<br />- Bye.
409825 412316 - Here you go, Mr. Jacks.<br />- Thank you.
415164 416756 Mr. Jacks?
417666 422000 I was wondering if you'd made any decision<br />regarding the assistant manager's position.
422404 426602 Well, I'm still deciding, and right<br />now, it's between Stu and yourself.
426675 427937 Stu Rubin, the new guy?
428010 431810 Well, I know he's new, but he's also<br />quite aggressive, and we like that.
431914 434508 You know, Stu's someone who's not<br />afraid to crunch the numbers
434617 436448 and make the tough decisions.
436519 439113 I'm perfectly capable of<br />making the tough decisions.
439188 442521 I'll let you know as<br />soon as I decide. Okay?
443359 445927 In the meantime, take him through<br />our loan qualifying procedures,
445928 448362 just in case, all right?
448964 450192 Okay.
451534 454526 And would you mind taking<br />your lunch break now?
454637 455695 Sure.
455805 458968 And maybe on your way back, you<br />could pick me up a Turkey club?
459041 463944 Turkey club, excellent choice! You<br />mind picking one up for me? Thanks.
464380 465972 And spicy mustard.
467383 468850 - What have you got?<br />- Could I get your approval on this?
468951 470680 - This is the loan we talked about before.<br />- The loan.
470786 471980 Exactly.
472488 474183 - Good one, huh?<br />- One-point-five?
474290 475770 Absolutely, and it'll<br />be one of many.
479895 483296 Well, Professor, congratulations on<br />making it through your first week.
483399 486562 Thank you very much. Mmm.
486669 491402 - I thought you'd have a full beard by now.<br />- So did I. I'm a little disappointed.
491674 494905 Man, this thing. That's it.<br />I'm done. I'm out.
495911 497742 Chris, don't even bother.
498747 500044 I gotta get a new one.
500149 503641 I'm telling you, you're gonna drive<br />yourself nuts. It's completely
504253 505584 broken.
508357 514421 - Was broken.<br />- You are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.
514930 518161 I almost forgot. Found<br />it at the bank.
518934 520492 What is this?
522004 527203 No way! Wow. It's a 1929 Standing<br />Liberty, and it's almost fully struck.
527376 529071 You found this in regular<br />circulation at the bank?
529178 530236 I did.
530346 533543 I'm gonna add this to my<br />nerdy coin collection.
534350 535612 - Thank you, baby.<br />- Okay.
535718 537618 Thanks for thinking of me.
539054 540783 - All right. Bye.<br />- Bye.
540890 543017 - See you later.<br />- I'll see you later, okay?
545461 546951 - Dr Dalton.<br />- <i>Hello, dear.</i>
547296 549628 - Hi, Mom.<br />- <i>What are you doing?</i>
549732 551393 Christine just came over<br />and brought some lunch,
551467 554027 - and I'm correcting some papers.<br />- <i>Christine? The one from the farm?</i>
554136 556798 Yeah, Mom, the girl I've been<br />dating for almost a year,
556906 559033 the girl who's coming for dinner.<br />We're still on for dinner?
559141 561541 - <i>I'm sure she's a very sweet girl.</i><br />- She is. I can't wait for you...
561644 564135 <i>But you know your father and I just<br />have certain expectations for you</i>.
564246 566908 - I can't really do the expectations...<br />- <i>I understand Amy Kulick is looking</i>
566982 568643 - <i>for someone to play tennis with</i>.<br />- Yeah, I...
568751 571276 <i>You know, she graduated<br />from Yale Law with honours,</i>
571387 573719 <i>and she's a very<br />successful attorney now.</i>
573822 576120 - I know. You told me.<br />- <i>Yeah, that's the kind of girl.</i>
576225 578557 - <i>I would love to see you with.</i><br />- Mother...
578661 582324 <i>She's the kind of woman who<br />could really help you socially</i>
582431 584296 <i>and, as a result,<br />in your career.</i>
584400 586595 <i>And that's the kind of thing you<br />should be thinking about now</i>.
586669 588466 - Mother, I don't wanna...<br />- <i>You can't be playing around</i>
588570 589594 <i>with little girls<br />off the farm.</i>
589672 592106 I think you're really gonna... I<br />think you're really gonna like...
592174 593574 <i>It's time to really<br />find a partner.</i>
598948 601280 Christine, you<br />messed up my order.
602184 605779 - No, I didn't.<br />- Yeah, I said no Mayo.
607690 609521 You never said that.
612027 614587 You know what? Don't sweat it.<br />It's okay.
629812 632474 Mr. Jacks, by the way,<br />aren't you a Laker fan?
632548 633606 I am a Laker fan.
633716 636150 My Mom is having this thing on Sunday.<br />I can't use these.
636218 637981 - Are you serious?<br />- Yeah. Absolutely. You want them?
638053 639384 - These are great seats!<br />- They are great seats.
639488 641046 This is where they bring<br />the hot dogs right to you.
641390 642982 Yes, it is. You are gonna<br />hobnob with celebs.
643058 645026 - You sure that's okay?<br />- Absolutely, it's okay. Yeah.
645127 646822 - Well, thank you, Stu.<br />- Take them. Absolutely.
646895 648487 - Wow.<br />- Say hey to Kobe for me.
648564 650054 Of course.
654169 655659 Will you help me?
656572 658369 Of course. What<br />can I do for you?
658474 663002 Your trucks are at my house. The<br />men are packing all my things,
663345 666508 private things. Please,<br />make them stop.
673088 675022 - Mrs...<br />- Ganush.
676425 679189 Mrs. Ganush, the bank<br />is informing you
679261 683493 of their intent to repossess your<br />property at 325 Brandon Street today.
683599 686659 But this is my<br />home for 30 years.
687603 691869 And I make every payment until<br />the sickness took my eye.
692708 697008 I hope to have more money soon. I<br />just need a little more time. You...
697112 700445 I don't think my manager's going<br />to extend you any more credit.
702184 705711 Please. Won't you try?
710726 712887 - Okay.<br />- Bless you.
714797 716287 Bless you!
721904 723394 We have an elderly<br />woman asking
723472 725963 for an extension on<br />her mortgage payment.
726075 729567 She's on a fixed income, and<br />she's had some medical problems.
729645 732637 There's gotta be something<br />we can do to help her.
739321 742722 Well, apparently, we've already<br />granted her two extensions.
742991 746791 And, you know, on this type of<br />foreclosure, we seize the trapped equity
746895 749329 and the bank makes a<br />sizable amount in fees.
749431 751626 We would have to throw<br />her out of her house.
751733 753428 It's a tough decision.
754770 756101 Your call.
781463 783124 I'll take care of it.
803318 806287 Mrs. Ganush. I'm<br />sorry, Mrs. Ganush,
806388 809152 but another extension on the<br />loan is out of the question.
809224 811715 - What? - I would like to help,<br />but it is in the bank's...
811827 816230 No, please, this is my home.<br />Where will I live?
817566 820296 You list your granddaughter as a reference.<br />Maybe you could stay with her.
820402 821994 I would not burden her.
823505 826167 And there are several fine assisted<br />living facilities for the elderly...
826241 831076 A nursing home? No, I would never<br />live in one of those places.
833148 834843 I'm really sorry.
859608 862372 I am proud woman, Miss Brown,
862778 865713 and never have I<br />begged for anything.
867883 871114 But now, I beg for you.
871620 873952 - I humble myself before you.<br />- Mrs. Ganush. Mrs. Ganush, please.
874056 876718 - Please stand up.<br />- I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.
876792 879784 On my mother's grave, I beg you!
880295 884061 Please let go. Let go!<br />Security! Stop!
886068 888901 - Over here, Billy! Over here!<br />- We're coming.
897412 899812 You shame me.
909391 913088 I beg you, and you shame me.
914429 916590 I think your business is<br />finished here, ma'am.
917332 918765 Let's go.
925107 926267 Mrs. Ganush...
933615 935173 Get out of here!
938453 940444 - Come on, ma'am.<br />- Let's go.
945794 948592 I never saw anything<br />quite like that before.
949197 950755 Are you okay?
952701 955192 You handled that just<br />right, you know.
966048 968778 - Good night. See you tomorrow.<br />- Okay.
971887 975118 You know, I just finished going<br />over this McPherson loan.
975223 978624 - This is very impressive work.<br />- Thanks.
978727 981161 Would you mind taking this home<br />tonight and finishing it up?
981229 984494 Because I would like to show it to<br />the regional veep in the morning.
984566 986363 - I would love to.<br />- Great.
986468 987833 Thank you.
987903 991395 And as far as that assistant<br />manager's position goes,
992174 994472 you're at the top of the list.
1108256 1111191 You shamed me.
1235650 1237811 I beat you, you old bitch!
1267515 1268675 No!
1296544 1299638 Lamia.
1314129 1318156 Soon it will be you who<br />comes begging to me.
1349497 1352523 - She's right over there.<br />- Thank you, thank you.
1353101 1354329 Hey!
1359174 1361165 Once they send some officers<br />over to have a talk with her,
1361276 1362538 she's not gonna be bothering<br />you any more, okay?
1362610 1364100 So don't even think about her.
1364212 1365736 And I'm gonna call Mr<br />Jacks and just make sure
1365847 1368008 he can have somebody walk you<br />to your car every night, okay?
1368116 1369344 Okay.
1369884 1373684 I just thank God you're okay.<br />You are okay, right?
1374522 1375784 I'm fine.
1377125 1379457 What? What's the matter?
1380628 1385258 It's just that maybe I could have gotten<br />her another extension on her loan.
1385366 1386731 Chris, no, don't do that.
1386801 1389964 You said the bank granted this woman<br />two extensions already, right?
1390071 1392130 I'm sorry, if you don't pay your<br />mortgage, you lose your house.
1392240 1394902 What does this woman expect?<br />It's not your fault.
1394976 1397536 You can't beat<br />yourself up over it.
1404486 1407250 I mean, what'd she expect?<br />It's not your fault.
1407322 1410485 And regardless of what you may<br />or may not have been able to do,
1410759 1413387 that's still no<br />justification for her...
1421669 1423899 What is it? What's wrong?
1424439 1427408 - Did you hear that?<br />- What?
1427842 1429332 Really? You didn't?
1430845 1432506 No. What?
1436851 1440014 I know this is gonna sound weird,<br />but I wanna get my fortune read.
1441089 1445025 Now? Are you kidding?
1446694 1449527 Come on, Chris. I'll read<br />your fortune for you.
1450031 1452022 In the near future, we are<br />gonna get in the car,
1452133 1455034 - go home and relax.<br />- Clay, I really want to do this.
1455136 1457866 Why? Because of what happened<br />with that old woman?
1457972 1461271 Chris, I really think we<br />should just get you home now.
1463044 1464636 Can you do this for me?
1472554 1475387 I pray to God none of my<br />students see me here.
1476891 1480122 The only class I'll be able to<br />teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.
1482897 1484956 Yeah, there's so many<br />things to choose from here.
1485066 1488627 Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,<br />which is a weird little dried monkey head.
1488736 1490897 Wait, no, never<br />mind, he's got one.
1493575 1495907 I am Rham Jas, seer.
1496744 1499162 I'm Christine<br />and this is Clay.
1499163 1501579 But you probably already<br />knew that, right?
1503251 1506186 - Just kidding.<br />- How can I help you?
1506254 1509849 I would like to have my fortune read.<br />Can you do that?
1509924 1512984 I have the ability to<br />see certain energies.
1513094 1516689 Sometimes these energies are a<br />foretoken of things to come.
1516764 1518026 $60, please.
1518099 1519862 - Seriously?<br />- Yes.
1519934 1523597 Sixty... Doesn't that seem a little<br />steep for this sort of thing?
1523705 1528506 - If you're not serious, please go.<br />- All right. Come on, Chris.
1528610 1531170 Wait, wait! I'll... I'll pay.
1531279 1534442 No, you know what? You know what?<br />I got it. I got it.
1535116 1539280 - There you go.<br />- Platinum card. Very good.
1545393 1546621 Thank you.
1547195 1548594 - Here, here, baby.<br />- Thanks.
1548696 1549890 Sure.
1552300 1555064 Uh-uh. Please.
1555970 1556959 Okay.
1557705 1560572 So, you wish to know<br />something of your destiny.
1560642 1561802 - Yes.<br />- Very good.
1561910 1563477 Let's see what the<br />fates have in store.
1563478 1565742 You know, Freud said destiny<br />was not an act of fate,
1565813 1567576 but rather something created<br />by our subconscious
1567649 1569446 to control our<br />conscious choices.
1569550 1574578 That's true. But we cannot attempt to<br />understand the world by intellect alone.
1575256 1576985 - Carl Jung.<br />- Yes.
1577659 1580719 From his treatise<br /><i>Psychological Types.</i>
1580828 1582529 So...
1582530 1584250 Jung, the New Agers'<br />favourite psychologist.
1584332 1586596 Because he wasn't afraid to<br />bring God into the equation.
1586668 1587965 Well, he wasn't afraid<br />to bring God into...
1588069 1589770 Clay, Clay, come on.
1589771 1591470 Let's do it. I know. Come on.<br />Let's start.
1591572 1593335 - Shall we?<br />- I'm ready.
1593975 1595101 Very well. Please,<br />give me your hand.
1595176 1596837 Okay.
1597345 1599074 This way. Okay.
1605853 1607343 You work with money.
1608690 1609748 That's right.
1611092 1613458 And you've recently<br />lost something.
1615630 1621091 - No, I don't think so.<br />- No. No, you haven't lost anything.
1622203 1624535 But something's been<br />taken from you.
1625440 1626600 No.
1627208 1630143 - A button.<br />- Oh, my God. Yes!
1631045 1632876 Well, anyone can see she's<br />missing a button! So what?
1632981 1634314 But, Clay, it was<br />really strange.
1634315 1636715 The old woman today, she took<br />a button from my sleeve.
1636818 1640652 - Why would she do that?<br />- If you would both please just be quiet!
1713294 1716457 - I think that's enough for tonight.<br />- What's wrong?
1716564 1719329 I'm tired, and I see<br />it's become quite late.
1719330 1722093 I will, of course,<br />refund your money.
1722203 1724728 Wait, wait, wait! Did<br />you see something?
1726307 1727934 A dark spirit has come upon you.
1728042 1729475 - What do you mean?<br />- Well, he's...
1729577 1731442 Did you blaspheme the dead<br />while visiting a graveyard?
1731546 1733605 - No!<br />- Did you play with a Ouija board
1733714 1735545 or consort with those who<br />practise the black arts?
1735650 1736947 All right, take it easy, man.<br />Come on.
1737051 1739076 Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay.<br />No. No, I didn't.
1739821 1741982 Perhaps someone has cursed you.
1748396 1752162 - Then how did he know all that?<br />- Know what? That you lost a button?
1753000 1754490 And by the way, he didn't<br />really know that much.
1754602 1756502 He makes a couple of<br />good guesses, then he...
1756604 1759505 He stirs you up, and then he leaves<br />you with all these questions
1759607 1762167 and, conveniently,<br />his business card.
1762844 1765335 Come on, Chris,<br />he's a scam artist.
1765746 1768840 But he didn't want the money. He<br />tried to give it back, remember?
1768950 1772681 Well, he sort of tried, but in<br />the end, he took it, didn't he?
1775690 1777180 I guess so.
1801182 1802444 I gotta go meet the guy<br />that's towing your car,
1802550 1803539 so you gonna be okay?
1803684 1805948 - Yeah.<br />- All right. Kitty, take care of her.
1806053 1807714 - I'll see you in about an hour. Love you.<br />- Okay.
1807855 1809049 Okay.
1990471 1991733 Damn it.
2037284 2038945 - Here. Put that on your lip.<br />- Thank you.
2039086 2042522 I can't believe she came to the house.<br />This is so nuts. I'm calling the cops.
2042623 2045751 - It wasn't her.<br />- Who was it then?
2045860 2049057 - I don't know. I couldn't see who it was.<br />- Of course it was her. It had to be her.
2049130 2051064 No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!
2051132 2053293 It was somebody. Chris,<br />it had to be somebody.
2053434 2054867 The lights were out. You just<br />couldn't see who it was,
2054969 2058132 - but I'm guessing it was...<br />- Clay, there wasn't anybody here.
2058973 2060702 Then who did this?
2061642 2063872 Who hit you in the face?
2066046 2067206 Huh?
2071318 2074219 I think it's just a reaction to her<br />being attacked earlier in the day.
2074321 2076812 Yeah. Classic symptoms of<br />post-traumatic stress.
2076957 2080324 Yeah, she's showing signs of<br />panic and paranoia. So...
2080461 2082895 - Do you want me to walk you out, man?<br />- No, no, no, I'll be fine.
2082997 2084328 All right.
2087668 2089158 Hey, hey.
2090738 2091966 How you doing?
2092072 2093232 - Better.<br />- Yeah?
2093340 2095399 Especially after the<br />doctor explained it to me.
2095509 2097443 He said that victims<br />of violence,
2097511 2099979 - they re-experience.<i>..</i><br />- Re-experience their trauma.
2100347 2103748 I misinterpreted it to be<br />something more than it was.
2104685 2108177 - Happens.<br />- I just... I feel...
2109323 2111257 - What?<br />- Kind of embarrassed.
2111358 2115089 Are you kidding? No. You never<br />have to be embarrassed with me.
2117431 2118693 Okay?
2124004 2127997 Hey, listen, I was thinking maybe we<br />could take a little trip on Saturday,
2128108 2130872 - get on the train and go to Santa Barbara.<br />- Your folks' cabin.
2131011 2132512 Yeah, if you're up<br />for it, the cabin.
2132513 2134777 - Oh, my God, I would love to!<br />- Yeah? Good.
2134882 2137180 - That'd be so exciting.<br />- Baby, you're gonna love it.
2137284 2138308 - You're gonna love it.<br />- Okay, good.
2138385 2139443 I'm excited for you to see it.
2139553 2141111 - There's trees and it's private.<br />- That would be great.
2141222 2142712 It'll be great. It'll be good.
2142857 2148227 I think we need to. And we can just...<br />We can just talk and stuff.
2276090 2277352 What?
2278759 2282695 - What's the matter?<br />- I couldn't... I couldn't wake up.
2283664 2288033 It's okay. Okay. Come here.<br />It was just a dream.
2300714 2303444 Baby, that's the rental car<br />they dropped off this morning.
2303550 2305177 - Okay? Sure.<br />- Thanks.
2306053 2308112 - Love you.<br />- Love you, too.
2310024 2314051 Hey, baby, try not to piss off<br />any old ladies today, okay?
2332913 2334403 Hey, Christine?
2334915 2337349 - What, are you just getting here?<br />- What are you, the hall monitor?
2337418 2339750 Ha, ha. Very funny, Christine.
2340587 2342214 What's this?
2342856 2344517 What do you want?
2344591 2347856 I need you to finish teaching<br />me the loan procedures.
2349763 2352698 I've got a lot on my mind.<br />Can we do this tomorrow?
2352766 2354028 - Sure.<br />- Okay.
2354101 2356365 I'll just tell Mr. Jacks that you<br />don't have the time right now.
2356437 2359770 - Maybe he can tell me.<br />- No, no! Okay, I'll do it.
2360274 2361536 Okay.
2362776 2366041 We were going over the<br />asset-based lending guidelines.
2366113 2371107 Right. Let's say your client is a company<br />that can't get traditional bank financing.
2382396 2384626 - And?<br />- And.<i>..</i>
2389803 2391134 And?
2393307 2394638 And...
2397077 2400137 And get your filthy pig<br />knuckle off my desk!
2408288 2410779 Christine Blood... Brown.
2411658 2413922 Christine. Your nose.
2415429 2416987 Sure, can you hold?
2417131 2419463 - Let me help you.<br />- No, no, I've got it under control.
2419833 2421824 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
2423170 2425502 God! Oh, my God! Stop it!
2426440 2427668 Mr. Jacks!
2427808 2429503 - Did I get any in my mouth?<br />- Oh, my God!
2429643 2432840 - Did I get any in my mouth?<br />- Let me take you over here to get clean.
2432946 2436279 I'm so sorry! Oh, my God!
2436350 2439012 - What was that about?<br />- It's just a nosebleed.
2439153 2442350 - Did I get any in my mouth?<br />- We'll clean you up. We have antiseptic.
2495209 2496676 What is it?
2500681 2503741 Hi. I came to see Sylvia Ganush.<br />Is she here?
2504384 2505874 Who are you?
2506753 2509347 I'm a friend of hers.
2510023 2511752 - Someone...<br />- Wait.
2514761 2518595 I know who you are. Grandma<br />told me you would come.
2518866 2522199 You are the woman from the bank,<br />the one who took her house.
2522269 2524103 Actually, it was the bank<br />that took the house.
2524104 2526265 I mean, I just work there.
2526607 2530099 In fact, I tried to help your<br />grandma get the house back,
2530210 2531768 but my boss wouldn't let me.
2531879 2535610 Are you going to stand here on<br />my porch and lie to my face?
2541255 2543440 No.
2543441 2545624 You used to be a real<br />fat girl, didn't you?
2552299 2554426 - Yeah.<br />- I can tell.
2555469 2557403 You are not welcome here.
2558238 2561139 Wait! Wait. I need to see her.
2561241 2564301 I need her to forgive me. And<br />I'll get her the house back.
2564444 2567413 And you are gonna make everything<br />all right for her, is that it?
2567481 2568641 Yes.
2570117 2571482 Come on.
2586667 2588259 Where is she?
2640387 2644050 - Get her off me! Get her off me!<br />- Come! Don't look.
2645692 2649150 - Grab her shoulder.<br />- Be a man! Lift her up!
2655369 2659066 - Be careful.<br />- Let's roll the dice!
2659873 2663070 Still going to make<br />everything all right for her?
2664511 2667537 You deserve everything<br />that is coming to you.
2673920 2675080 One more time!
2675589 2678683 I believe what plagues<br />you is the Lamia.
2678759 2681023 Lamia, that's the word<br />the old woman used.
2681094 2685087 The Black Goat, only summoned by<br />gypsies for their darkest deeds.
2685899 2691360 For the first three days, the Lamia appears<br />as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.
2691438 2694373 After that, it reveals itself<br />to be a taker of souls,
2694441 2696875 and it comes for the owner<br />of the accursed object.
2696943 2698433 Accursed object. What object?
2698545 2701946 Something taken from the<br />victim, cursed and given back.
2705952 2707249 This?
2709423 2710617 What if I just burn it?
2710757 2713783 I'm afraid no matter what<br />condition the button is in,
2714294 2717786 you would still be the owner. The<br />Lamia would still come to take you.
2717931 2719592 Take me where?
2726306 2730572 - Then how do I get rid of this?<br />- You could attempt to appease the spirit.
2730644 2732578 The simplest way would<br />be a blood offering.
2732646 2736582 A small creature could be<br />sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.
2736650 2738743 No way! Look, I'm a vegetarian.
2738819 2741754 I volunteer at the puppy<br />shelter, for Christ's sake.
2741822 2743915 I don't go around<br />killing animals.
2743990 2745991 You will be surprised what<br />you'll be willing to do
2745992 2748153 when the Lamia comes for you.
2750497 2752488 This will show you how.
2768648 2769808 Hi!
2996810 2998505 Here, kitty, kitty.
3020066 3021897 Chris! Chris?
3023570 3024832 Chris?
3026539 3029440 Hey, there you are. What<br />are you doing out here?
3029542 3031203 Baby, I called the bank.<br />They said you left early.
3031277 3034769 You're not answering my calls.<br />Is that blood?
3037517 3040179 No. Why would there be blood?
3040253 3043222 Yeah, baby, there's... There's<br />blood on your sleeve.
3043289 3045348 - Are you bleeding?<br />- No.
3046025 3047219 It was just tomato juice.
3047293 3052026 I was cutting a tomato in the kitchen<br />and it must have gotten on my sleeve.
3054033 3058436 Hey, Chris, why don't we do<br />this dinner another time?
3059305 3061967 You've had a rough couple of days.<br />I think it's better.
3062075 3064134 No, I want to go to the dinner.
3064244 3067577 I know, but are you sure<br />you're feeling all right?
3069382 3071714 Honestly, I haven't been.
3077957 3079549 But I think...
3079893 3082794 I think that everything<br />is gonna be okay now.
3084631 3086258 I really do.
3091137 3092798 What do you think?
3096443 3098172 You look beautiful.
3101748 3104911 - God, it's such a nice day!<br />- It really is. My God.
3104984 3107248 It's gonna be nice inside, too.
3109923 3111823 They're gonna love you.
3114594 3116186 - Clayton.<br />- Hello, Mother.
3116296 3117524 Good to see you.<br />This is Christine.
3117630 3119621 - That's my Mom, Trudy.<br />- Hello, Christine.
3119699 3121792 Hello. It's very<br />nice to meet you.
3122135 3124603 - Well.<br />- Please, come in. Come in.
3124671 3125763 Yes.
3126206 3127468 - Hey, Dad, how are you?<br />- Hey, son.
3127540 3129269 Good to see you, sir.
3129342 3131105 This is Christine. Christine,<br />this is my Dad, Leonard.
3131177 3132269 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hi, Maria. Thank you.
3132345 3135940 - You have a beautiful home.<br />- Well, thank you very much.
3136716 3138274 - Can I get you a drink?<br />- Yeah, wine?
3138351 3139716 - Do you guys want?<br />- Sure.
3139819 3143619 - Okay. Come help me.<br />- I'll be right back.
3143990 3146515 - I'll take a Chardonnay!<br />- Yes, dear.
3147460 3150156 - I hope you don't mind.<br />- How thoughtful.
3150230 3151891 - Homemade?<br />- Yes.
3151998 3154796 And what type of cake<br />would you call that?
3155335 3156859 It's called
3158071 3159299 a harvest cake.
3159372 3162466 Is that something you<br />would make on a farm?
3163376 3164570 No.
3166813 3172479 I mean, not any more. We used to<br />when we had a gaggle of geese.
3172552 3175214 - Geese?<br />- Well, right around the harvest time,
3175321 3178415 that's when your goose eggs<br />will make a real dense yolk.
3178992 3180983 It makes for a rich cake.
3183263 3185231 Well, just thank you.
3186232 3188564 - Here we are.<br />- Sorry to interrupt the bonding sesh.
3188668 3189862 - Why don't you join us in the dining room?<br />- Good.
3189936 3192666 - Yeah, let's go. It's right in here.<br />- Okay.
3194207 3195765 - Jeez.<br />- Hecuba.
3196776 3199438 I never did understand that damned animal.<br />I hate cats.
3199546 3203175 That is so strange. Hecuba<br />is usually very sweet.
3203249 3206082 That's okay. I had a cat.<br />I understand.
3206753 3209244 You mean... You mean<br />you have a cat.
3210523 3211854 What do you mean? Did<br />something happen?
3211925 3213950 Unless something<br />happened to him.
3216629 3218790 Well, how am I supposed to know?
3219198 3222361 I mean, you know how cats are.<br />They come and they go.
3225471 3227029 That's true.
3229375 3232310 - Well, should...<br />- Well... Yes. Yes, please.
3233079 3235309 So, how's the coin<br />collection, son?
3235415 3238282 That's my Dad's way of saying,<br />"So, you're still a huge nerd?"
3238384 3240716 It's good. It's good. In<br />fact, Christine just got me
3240787 3242755 a 1929 Standing Liberty<br />quarter at her bank.
3242822 3244881 - Really?<br />- Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.
3244958 3248257 I just think the job of a bank<br />teller must be so difficult,
3248328 3251991 with all that counting and repetition.<br />It must get very tedious.
3252098 3253292 Yes, you're right,
3253800 3255563 - but I'm not a teller.<br />- Oh?
3255635 3257432 Yeah, Mom, I told you.<br />Christine's a loan officer.
3257503 3260836 She handles all the loans for small<br />businesses and homes for her bank.
3260940 3264467 And she's up for this big promotion, so...<br />Right, Chris?
3264577 3267740 If I could close this one account that<br />I'm working on, it would really help.
3267814 3269907 That must be a very<br />important loan.
3269983 3272816 It's the biggest that my<br />branch has ever handled.
3272919 3275080 And how did that come to you?
3275421 3277582 Well, I was reading the<br /><i>Wall Street Journal</i>
3277657 3279955 and came across this<br />medical supply company
3280026 3283462 that was looking to expand but<br />didn't have the liquidity.
3283529 3286430 So I met with their CFO<br />and presented a formula
3286499 3289263 for restructuring some<br />of their long-term debt.
3289335 3291929 Sounds like you've got a lot<br />going for you, Christine.
3292005 3294872 Well, your mother must<br />be very proud of you.
3295108 3296507 I suppose.
3302482 3304450 I don't see much of my mother.
3304517 3306116 Why is that?
3306117 3307757 Wow, Mom, that's...<br />It's kind of personal.
3307820 3309879 I'm speaking to Christine.
3313693 3318494 Well, ever since my Dad died,<br />she doesn't talk much.
3318965 3325336 She just stays on the farm and<br />keeps to herself because...
3326673 3328140 Because?
3328207 3331973 Because her husband died, Mom, and<br />she just wants to be by herself.
3332045 3335139 - Why don't...<br />- Because my mother's an alcoholic.
3336849 3337873 Oh.
3339385 3340875 I'm sorry.
3341921 3344651 It's certainly nothing<br />to be ashamed of.
3345324 3348589 I have to say, I find your<br />honesty very refreshing.
3349495 3352828 My father had a drinking problem, and<br />I was always too ashamed to admit it.
3354067 3355932 You've got backbone.
3356602 3358331 Unlike that last<br />girl he brought by.
3358404 3359996 - What was her name?<br />- Alice.
3360073 3361597 - We don't have to...<br />- Alicia!
3361708 3363835 - Alicia.<br />- She was dreadful, Christine.
3363910 3367004 She was ill-mannered,<br />no ambition at all.
3367080 3368206 - That's not really...<br />- They met on the Internet.
3368281 3369373 - There you go.<br />- What is that,
3369449 3370507 - "They met on the Internet"?<br />- Really?
3370583 3372847 - What does that mean?<br />- Am I being too hard on him?
3372919 3373943 No, not at all.
3374053 3375384 - There you go. Thank you very much.<br />- Thanks a lot...
3375455 3377116 You know, I think I will try<br />some of that cake of yours.
3377223 3379823 ...for tossing me under the bus.<br />- Look at that. It looks great.
3380359 3382589 - You're gonna like it.<br />- It looks so interesting.
3382695 3386062 You only dislike it if you<br />hate delicious things.
3387700 3389691 - Well, that counts us out.<br />- Not my problem.
3391070 3392094 Lovely.
3392205 3393772 Thank you, Christine.<br />This is wonderful.
3393773 3395604 It also changed the<br />subject nicely.
3395708 3397437 Thank you. That looks good!
3398377 3399901 - Harvest cake, huh?<br />- That's right.
3399979 3402379 - We'll have to get this recipe.<br />- It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?
3402448 3404279 Did you hear something?
3404751 3406378 No. You okay?
3407053 3408213 Tasty!
3408488 3410956 - I like it a lot.<br />- I do like it.
3411624 3415754 You know, Mom, when you say we met on<br />the Internet, it's a little misleading.
3434180 3436910 Yes, well you need to do<br />that to find a good mate.
3436983 3438507 - She has a Facebook...<br />- You can't even trust
3438618 3440745 the things you hear or that<br />people write about themselves.
3440820 3441833 Very nice.
3441834 3442845 Even the pictures are<br />false half the time.
3442955 3444155 - Isn't that true?<br />- It's true.
3444257 3446282 - It doesn't really count.<br />- I don't think it's a misconception
3446359 3447986 to think that people<br />of good breeding
3448094 3450193 and success should be<br />able to meet potential
3450194 3452292 life partners in a<br />realistic situation.
3452365 3453957 Well, you also have<br />a thing about bars.
3463609 3465372 Would you, Christine?
3467713 3472514 - No. No, of course not.<br />- What? What... But we did.
3472618 3474483 We met at a bar, Chris.<br />What are you talking about?
3474554 3476351 - Oh, my God, that's right!<br />- She...
3476455 3480858 - You two better get your stories straight.<br />- It's not a Klan rally, Mom. It's a bar.
3482562 3486999 Yeah, we met... We met at a bar, and<br />we set up the date on the Internet.
3487967 3490993 You okay? You okay?
3491304 3495832 Some water? Baby, have some...<br />Went down the wrong pipe.
3496809 3498140 Oh, my God!
3510022 3512490 I'm sorry, I don't... There<br />must be a window open.
3513693 3514853 Chris?
3519232 3521063 Okay, I hear you!
3521167 3522657 - What in the hell?<br />- Leave me alone.
3522768 3525168 - Just leave me the hell alone!<br />- Hey! Hey! Chris! Stop it!
3525271 3527364 Baby! There's no one there.
3530009 3531101 Okay.
3533446 3536779 - I think I'd better go.<br />- Yes, I think that would be best.
3537383 3541376 - I know. Wait, Chris...<br />- Don't follow her! She's a sick girl.
3541454 3543888 - Mom, she needs my help.<br />- Let her go.
3546125 3547183 Wait!
3548394 3550294 What's the matter?
3550796 3554789 Look, I did what you said! I<br />killed that little kitty!
3555234 3557065 You're so full of shit!
3557136 3559934 These are elusive and powerful<br />forces we are dealing with.
3560039 3561973 There are no guarantees.
3579492 3582393 We must speak directly<br />to this dark spirit.
3582929 3586660 We must dissuade it from<br />taking your soul, and soon.
3587833 3591735 - I know someone who can help us.<br />- And I'm supposed to trust you?
3591837 3595898 Tomorrow is the third day. After<br />that, the Lamia will come for you.
3596008 3599171 We can't let that happen.<br />But you must understand,
3600246 3603841 the woman who can help us must<br />put herself at great risk.
3604183 3607675 - She will not do that for free.<br />- What do you need from me?
3608020 3610250 $10,000 cash
3611757 3613019 by tomorrow.
3626539 3628268 - Mr. Jacks.<br />- Yeah?
3628874 3633208 This is kind of awkward for me,<br />and I know it's not official yet,
3634280 3637977 but I was wondering if I could get<br />an advance for the new position.
3638050 3640280 What, the assistant<br />manager's position?
3640386 3643617 Yes. See, one of my family<br />members is really sick.
3645057 3648117 - They're not gonna die, but they could.<br />- Christine. Christine.
3648227 3652857 There's a problem. The McPherson<br />deal was cancelled last night.
3652965 3654398 - What?<br />- Yeah.
3655067 3658798 Right after I informed the regional<br />office that we had this big loan pending,
3658904 3662396 I find out that they just made<br />their deal over at First National.
3662508 3664476 Now, I gotta call in to see<br />what exactly happened,
3664477 3668413 but right now, this does not<br />look too good for you or for me.
3669982 3674248 So, this assistant manager<br />promotion has been delayed.
3675354 3678323 In fact, you know, I think, with<br />everything that's been happening,
3678424 3681587 I think I'm gonna have<br />to give this job to Stu.
3682495 3684258 Stu. I see.
3685331 3687993 I'm sorry. Look, if you've<br />got family problems,
3688100 3691592 maybe you should take the day<br />off, sort them out and...
3759672 3762835 - So, how much?<br />- $3,800 for everything.
3762975 3765808 - Including my jewellery?<br />- Including.
3765911 3768778 But this stuff is worth<br />so much more than that.
3768848 3773080 Please. This is all I have.<br />I'm begging you.
3774487 3776250 Take it or leave it.
3784864 3786695 Chris? Chris?
3790202 3791362 Baby?
3810556 3813218 I thought you were<br />lactose intolerant.
3814560 3815720 I am.
3816896 3820127 But then I thought, "Screw<br />it, I'm eating ice cream."
3823402 3825063 I paid Rham Jas.
3828574 3831566 What? You're kidding me.
3832411 3833969 I paid him.
3835047 3838073 Why? I mean, I thought<br />that you didn't believe.
3838551 3841543 I don't know what I<br />believe in any more.
3841654 3845420 I really don't, but I know<br />that you believe in this.
3846559 3848186 I know how important<br />it is to you,
3848260 3851661 and I know how much pain<br />this is causing you.
3853232 3856827 And, I also remembered...
3857603 3860333 I remembered a<br />promise that I made
3861440 3863772 the night I fell<br />in love with you.
3863909 3866104 I told myself that I would...
3866845 3870781 I would always look out for you.<br />I'd always take care of you.
3872618 3874108 So I paid him.
3877289 3880122 You remember the night that<br />you fell in love with me?
3880259 3883251 I remember the second I<br />fell in love with you.
3884964 3886363 Oh, my God.
3899478 3901708 You sure you don't want<br />me to go in with you?
3901814 3903247 He said I should come alone.
3903315 3906648 Yeah, I know, I know he did.<br />He told me the same thing.
3942988 3944683 Christine, if you will permit me
3944823 3947986 the pleasure of an<br />introduction, Shaun San Dena.
3951363 3953923 - Welcome.<br />- How do you do?
3954867 3957097 Shaun San Dena is an<br />experienced medium.
3957202 3960296 Furthermore, she's personally<br />been touched by the Lamia.
3960372 3964866 I first encountered this spirit<br />many years ago in this very house.
3966211 3967872 And what happened?
3969948 3974783 I lost a young boy's<br />soul to the beast.
3980225 3983991 I have waited these long years
3985064 3988556 for a chance at<br />redeeming myself,
3989068 3992196 a chance to destroy<br />the foul thing.
3992871 3995066 - And...<br />- <i>Tetièko,</i> please.
4000245 4003237 Tonight, my chance will come.
4004416 4008079 But to summon it, I<br />will need your help.
4009555 4011216 Can you be strong?
4013926 4015257 I'll try.
4020432 4023595 My late husband, Sandor,<br />was also medium.
4024203 4026103 He chose this site to<br />build a house upon
4026238 4030106 because he sensed certain<br />forces at work here.
4031276 4034768 In this place, there<br />is a particular...
4043622 4045112 A particular<br />confluence of forces
4045257 4048385 which allows a doorway to be opened<br />through which we may pass...
4053465 4056730 ...and through which others<br />may pass into our world.
4062474 4064135 Please be seated.
4092471 4093495 What's going on?
4093605 4096472 Everything we're doing<br />is for your own good.
4096473 4099339 Please. Christine, please.
4104950 4106281 Thank you.
4136215 4140208 Once the spirit has entered me,<br />put my hand upon the animal.
4140819 4143379 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes.
4144022 4147037 I force the spirit of the<br />Lamia into the goat.
4147038 4150052 Milos, that's when you strike.
4153065 4154555 I understand.
4165511 4167502 We all must be receptive.
4182427 4186261 - What am I supposed to do?<br />- You must allow the darkness in.
4186398 4190027 You must invite the dead to<br />co-mingle with your spirit.
4190903 4193064 - I'm scared.<br />- Yes.
4194072 4198736 Now repeat these words, "I<br />welcome the dead into my soul."
4202447 4205905 - I welcome the dead into my soul.<br />- You must believe it!
4206685 4209051 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4210556 4213684 - I welcome the dead into my soul.<br />- I welcome the dead into my soul.
4215093 4217220 - I welcome the dead into my soul.<br />...lnto my soul.
4218463 4223867 I welcome the dead into my soul.<br />I welcome the dead into my soul.
4224036 4232036 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4233478 4234706 I welcome the dead...
4237282 4243118 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4243221 4244745 I welcome the dead into...
4248327 4250625 Something else is here with us.
4252264 4253322 Yes.
4281994 4283928 This is not the Lamia.
4283996 4287261 It is the spirit of some
4287933 4291300 unsettled soul from years ago.
4292270 4295330 Sometimes the unsettled<br />ones linger by the door.
4296441 4299103 There are others here, as well.
4309354 4312289 Begone, foolish spirits! Begone!
4325971 4327404 She is coming.
4430642 4433509 Who now inhabits the<br />body of Shaun San Dena?
4437649 4440743 Lamia!
4446858 4448917 Lamia, what is it you desire?
4448994 4453328 I desire the soul<br />of Christine Brown!
4453598 4457295 We will feast upon it as<br />she festers in the grave!
4457369 4459929 No! It was my<br />manager, Jim Jacks!
4460005 4461870 - He was the one! He was...<br />- Silence!
4461973 4466205 Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded<br />from taking this insignificant woman.
4466311 4469212 Surely she is not worthy<br />of your greatness.
4478056 4479455 No!
4483495 4486862 I come for you, Christine.
4489067 4490625 You're mine!
4495841 4497069 No!
4497242 4501042 You tricked me! You<br />black-hearted whore!
4501146 4503706 - Now, Milos, now!<br />- You bitch.
4517095 4518995 Away, unclean spirit.
4535080 4536411 Lamia!
4536514 4541110 As one who summoned you to this circle,<br />I command you to leave this instant.
4547559 4549049 Christine!
4555700 4560228 I don't want your cat,<br />you dirty pork queen!
4571650 4573277 Shaun San Dena!
4574252 4576220 You must banish the spirit!
4576388 4577412 Yes!
4609821 4611083 Milos!
4611923 4615757 - Oh, my God. I'm okay.<br />- Thank God!
4615827 4617761 - I'm okay.<br />- Unbelievable!
4620365 4622356 - You did it!<br />- Thank God.
4624502 4625867 I tried.
4625971 4626995 Are you okay?
4627772 4629603 Oh, my God. Help me!
4634512 4636275 Call an ambulance.
4640151 4641778 Is she breathing?
4643355 4644879 No.
4647993 4649290 Oh, my gosh.
4690769 4693260 - It's so sad.<br />- Yes.
4693838 4696170 Strange how things work out.
4696241 4700200 She waited 40 years for another<br />chance to overcome the Lamia,
4701946 4706576 and finally, on the last<br />night of her life, she did.
4707452 4710012 No, I'm afraid you<br />misunderstand.
4711256 4714123 The Lamia cannot be<br />banished by a medium.
4714559 4717528 This is our lesson tonight.<br />I'm sorry.
4717595 4719529 - But I saw her get rid of the thing.<br />- No.
4719597 4722896 You saw her drive it from a séance.<br />That is all.
4723601 4726627 It will be back. The goat<br />was never slaughtered.
4727439 4729566 When this night is through,
4730375 4734038 the Lamia will come for the<br />owner of the accursed object.
4737715 4740099 Unless, of course, you<br />are no longer the owner.
4740100 4742482 Do you have the button?
4750328 4754059 Make a gift of it and you've<br />given the curse away.
4757735 4759430 Why didn't you tell<br />me this before?
4759504 4763065 Because the Lamia will tear the soul<br />out of whoever you give that to.
4763141 4765666 They'll burn in<br />hell for eternity.
4767445 4770505 And I would have<br />sent them there.
4771116 4773414 And I would be your accomplice.
4774986 4778752 Whatever you decide,<br />you have till morning.
4799878 4801209 Is it over?
4802547 4803878 It's over.
4807719 4808845 Clay!
4813391 4815359 You will burn in hell!
4815727 4820391 You will burn in hell! You<br />bitch, you'll burn in hell!
4820899 4822696 Your turn's coming!
4823234 4825668 - You will burn in hell!<br />- You okay?
4826838 4828203 Holy shit.
4842420 4844411 Okay, you sure you're still okay<br />about the Santa Barbara trip?
4844556 4845580 - Yeah, I'm fine.<br />- Yeah?
4845690 4849592 - And what time should I get you?<br />- It's better if I meet you at the station.
4849727 4851194 There's something I've<br />gotta do on the way.
4851262 4853355 I can do it. You want me<br />to do it on my way to...
4853431 4855865 No! No. I've got<br />it under control.
4856568 4859435 We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the...<br />Wait! Where's my envelope?
4859571 4862039 - What envelope?<br />- It was in my purse. I just had it!
4862106 4864199 - It's just an envelope.<br />- No, it's gotta be here!
4864275 4867210 It's here, so we'll<br />find it eventually.
4867879 4869210 - Oh, my God.<br />- Okay.
4869280 4871942 I thought I'd lost it. Okay.
4873284 4875275 Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.
4893304 4895795 Dad, can we go to<br />the Angel game?
4896307 4898122 What about the Dodgers?
4898123 4899936 We're only gonna be<br />in town for a few days.
4902747 4905978 I'm sure if I just tell him<br />how much I care about you,
4906117 4908415 I mean, he's gotta understand.
4912156 4914420 Are you sure you don't<br />want anything else?
4914492 4915481 No.
4915627 4918755 So you're just gonna sit here<br />drinking coffee all night long.
4918830 4922095 Yes. Maybe! What's it to you?
4922166 4926398 Honey, I make my money on tips.<br />Coffee drinkers don't tip.
4926504 4930406 Honey, just keep the coffee coming or<br />I'll give you a tip you won't forget.
4972216 4975947 Oh, my gosh. What a<br />delightful surprise.
4976888 4979618 You're the sweetest<br />person in the world.
4982293 4983954 Never mind what it's about, Stu.
4984062 4986030 Just get here in 10 minutes<br />or I'm gonna tell Mr. Jacks
4986130 4988325 something you don't<br />want me to tell him.
4988399 4990731 <i>Oh, yeah? Like what?</i>
4991069 4994800 Well, for starters, that you stole<br />the McPherson loan file off my desk
4994906 4998239 and gave it to First National.<br />Now you got nine minutes!
5003214 5005409 - Give me another.<br />- Seriously?
5013758 5016142 Oh, God, Christine,<br />please don't tell on me.
5016143 5018525 I mean, if my Dad<br />ever finds out...
5018596 5021895 - Just tell me what you want.<br />- I need to give something to you.
5021999 5024092 - A little gift.<br />- A gift?
5025570 5027868 But I don't understand. I<br />thought you called me down here
5027939 5029839 because I gave that loan<br />to First National...
5029941 5033069 Look, you don't need to understand.<br />Just shut up!
5035012 5037242 Now, this gift that I'm giving<br />you, it'll become your property.
5037348 5039942 You'll be the owner, all right?
5042787 5044084 Okay.
5049460 5050586 Okay.
5053798 5055095 What?
5056534 5057592 Forget it.
5058970 5061097 But I thought you wanted to give<br />it to me 'cause of the loan stuff.
5061205 5062570 Just leave.
5065710 5068645 Okay. Thank you so<br />much, Christine.
5075420 5077081 - But you're not gonna tell my Dad, right?<br />- Go!
5077155 5078247 Okay.
5089167 5091158 Who does deserve this?
5112023 5114116 Well? Is it possible?
5115359 5118419 There are gypsy blessings<br />bestowed upon the dead.
5118529 5120622 They give gifts<br />to their departed
5120765 5125031 to curry favour with the deceased's<br />soul, for, truly, the soul never dies.
5126871 5131865 Yes. I do believe you can give the<br />curse to someone who has passed on,
5132210 5135668 <i>but you must make a formal gift of<br />the accursed object to the deceased</i>.
5135780 5139477 I'll do better than that. I'll<br />shove it down her goddamn throat!
5140151 5141550 I'm gonna get some...
5248259 5250284 I'm giving it back to you!
5252229 5254424 You're gonna take this thing.
5255967 5258458 Are you gonna take this thing?
5260838 5262396 Take it!
5275519 5278352 That's the last of my<br />hair you're getting!
5283761 5289791 I, Christine Brown, do hereby<br />make a formal gift of this button
5289867 5292199 to you, Sylvia Ganush!
5294105 5296039 Choke on it, bitch!
5311055 5312522 Goodbye.
5401912 5404881 <i>Hi, It's Christine. Leave a<br />message and I'll call you back.</i>

5408052 5409417 <i>I'm sorry I'm<br />calling so early,</i>
5409487 5414049 <i>but last night, I found some troubling<br />information about our friend Stu Rubin.</i>
5414325 5417783 <i>Apparently, he stole your<br />file on the McPherson loan</i>
5417895 5421228 <i>and then tried to broker his<br />own deal at First National.</i>
5421298 5423266 <i>I guess he thought we<br />wouldn't find out.</i>
5423334 5425996 <i>And we wouldn't have either,<br />except that an hour ago,</i>
5426103 5429903 <i>he came by my house and tried<br />to pin the whole thing on you</i>.
5430975 5434502 <i>After I confronted him about a few<br />inconsistencies in his story,</i>
5434612 5438981 <i>he broke down crying and, well, we<br />won't be seeing him around any more</i>.
5440117 5443348 <i>So I just wanted you to know<br />that, come Monday morning</i>,
5443454 5447185 <i>that assistant manager's position<br />will be waiting for you</i>.
5459003 5461437 <i>Passenger Benson,<br />please meet your party</i>
5461505 5463598 <i>at the concourse<br />ticket counter.</i>
5466277 5467710 - <i>Welcome to Union Station.</i><br />- Cookie, miss?
5467812 5469479 - No, thanks.<br />- <i>We appreciate you choosing</i>
5469480 5471977 <i>train travel as your<br />mode of transportation,</i>
5471978 5474474 <i>and we wish you a<br />pleasant journey</i>.
5488065 5489726 Hi. Good morning.
5490067 5493230 - I'm sorry, we're not open.<br />- I just... I just want this coat.
5493370 5494394 We're not open yet.
5494538 5498565 My boyfriend and I are taking this<br />really special trip this morning.
5499910 5501002 Please?
5503848 5506749 <i>Northbound Surf liner,<br />service to Van Nuys,</i>
5506917 5509852 <i>Simi Valley, Oxnard,<br />Santa Barbara,</i>
5509920 5511854 - <i>San Luis Obispo...</i><br />- Clay?
5511922 5514413 - Hey!<br />- Hey! Oh, man! Hi.
5514525 5516965 God, I'm so glad you're here. So<br />many things I wanna tell you.
5517061 5518187 Wait, there's<br />something I wanna say
5518262 5521197 - while I have it straight in my head.<br />- Okay. Go ahead.
5521265 5523733 You never stopped<br />believing in me.
5524568 5526263 Thank you for that.
5527571 5532099 And there's something else, something<br />that I couldn't admit to before.
5532776 5537713 I could have given Mrs. Ganush another<br />extension on her loan, but I didn't.
5539884 5543411 It was my decision, and<br />it was wrong of me.
5553464 5555398 You have such a good heart.
5557935 5559459 You're so beautiful right now.
5562139 5564573 - Do you like my new coat?<br />- I do. I really do.
5564642 5566303 - What happened to the old one, though?<br />- I threw it out.
5566443 5569071 - And I never want to see it again.<br />- Oh, no.
5569313 5571230 That's too bad, because I...<br />Look what I found.
5571231 5573147 I found this in the car.
5573617 5574982 I thought...
5575486 5577920 And I thought maybe you could...
5578789 5580916 I thought maybe you<br />could sew it back on.
5580991 5584154 And I think you might have<br />my Standing Liberty quarter,
5584295 5586820 'cause the envelopes<br />kind of look the same.
5586931 5589422 Chris, what's wrong?
5590434 5592766 - Oh, my God!<br />- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
5593437 5595234 - Oh, God.<br />- Hey, hey. Hey! Hey!
5595339 5597671 Stop! Chris! Oh, God!
5598909 5603243 Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, no!<br />Hey! Oh, God, no!
5608352 5610013 Hey, no!
5615759 5617021 Help me!
5621532 5622760 Help me!
5623701 5625191 Help me!
