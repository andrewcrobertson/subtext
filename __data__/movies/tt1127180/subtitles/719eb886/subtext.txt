385719 389348 I think we can make this work.<br />I'll call you this afternoon and let you know.
389456 390514 - Thank you so much.<br />- Thank you.
390624 392558 - You're welcome.<br />- Thank you.
392959 394221 - Thank you.<br />- Have a great day.
394294 395886 - Yeah, you, too. Have a good day.<br />- Okay.
395962 397623 - Thank you.<br />- Bye.
409976 412467 - Here you go, Mr Jacks.<br />- Thank you.
415315 416907 Mr Jacks?
417817 422151 I was wondering if you'd made any decision<br />regarding the assistant manager's position.
422555 426753 Well, I'm still deciding, and right now,<br />it's between Stu and yourself.
426826 428088 Stu Rubin, the new guy?
428161 431961 Well, I know he's new, but he's also<br />quite aggressive, and we like that.
432065 434659 You know, Stu's someone who's<br />not afraid to crunch the numbers
434768 436599 and make the tough decisions.
436670 439264 I'm perfectly capable of<br />making the tough decisions.
439339 442672 I'll let you know as soon as I decide. Okay?
443510 445978 In the meantime, take him through<br />our loan qualifying procedures,
446079 448513 just in case, all right?
449115 450343 Okay.
451685 454677 And would you mind<br />taking your lunch break now?
454788 455846 Sure.
455956 459119 And maybe on your way back,<br />you could pick me up a turkey club?
459192 464095 Turkey club, excellent choice!<br />You mind picking one up for me? Thanks.
464531 466123 And spicy mustard.
467534 469001 - What have you got?<br />- Could I get your approval on this?
469102 470831 - This is the loan we talked about before.<br />- The loan.
470937 472131 Exactly.
472639 474334 - Good one, huh?<br />- One-point-five?
474441 475499 Absolutely, and it'll be one of many.
480046 483447 Well, Professor, congratulations<br />on making it through your first week.
483550 486713 Thank you very much. Mmm.
486820 491553 - I thought you'd have a full beard by now.<br />- So did I. I'm a little disappointed.
491825 495056 Man, this thing. That's it. I'm done. I'm out.
496062 497893 Chris, don't even bother.
498898 500195 I gotta get a new one.
500300 503792 I'm telling you, you're gonna<br />drive yourself nuts. It's completely
504404 505735 broken.
508508 514572 - Was broken.<br />- You are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.
515081 518312 I almost forgot. Found it at the bank.
519085 520643 What is this?
522155 527354 No way! Wow. It's a 1929 Standing Liberty,<br />and it's almost fully struck.
527527 529222 You found this in<br />regular circulation at the bank?
529329 530387 I did.
530497 533694 I'm gonna add this<br />to my nerdy coin collection.
534501 535763 - Thank you, baby.<br />- Okay.
535869 537769 Thanks for thinking of me.
539205 540934 - All right. Bye.<br />- Bye.
541041 543168 - See you later.<br />- I'll see you later, okay?
545612 547102 - Dr Dalton.<br />- <i>Hello, dear.</i>
547447 549779 - Hi, Mom.<br />- <i>What are you doing?</i>
549883 551544 Christine just came over<br />and brought some lunch,
551618 554178 - and I'm correcting some papers.<br />- <i>Christine? The one from the farm?</i>
554287 556949 Yeah, Mom, the girl I've been<br />dating for almost a year,
557057 559184 the girl who's coming for dinner.<br />We're still on for dinner?
559292 561692 - <i>I'm sure she's a very sweet girl.</i><br />- She is. I can't wait for you...
561795 564286 <i>But you know your father and I</i><br /><i>just have certain expectations for you</i>.
564397 567059 - I can't really do the expectations...<br />- <i>I understand Amy Kulick is looking</i>
567133 568794 - <i>for someone to play tennis with</i>.<br />- Yeah, I...
568902 571427 <i>You know, she graduated</i><br /><i>from Yale Law with honours,</i>
571538 573870 <i>and she's a very successful attorney now.</i>
573973 576271 - I know. You told me.<br />- <i>Yeah, that's the kind of girl</i>
576376 578708 - <i>I would love to see you with.</i><br />- Mother...
578812 582475 <i>She's the kind of woman</i><br /><i>who could really help you socially</i>
582582 584447 <i>and, as a result, in your career.</i>
584551 586746 <i>And that's the kind of thing you</i><br /><i>should be thinking about now</i>.
586820 588617 - Mother, I don't wanna...<br />- <i>You can't be playing around</i>
588721 589745 <i>with little girls off the farm.</i>
589823 592257 I think you're really gonna...<br />I think you're really gonna like...
592325 593587 <i>It's time to really find a partner.</i>
599099 601431 Christine, you messed up my order.
602335 605930 - No, I didn't.<br />- Yeah, I said no mayo.
607841 609672 You never said that.
612178 614738 You know what? Don't sweat it. It's okay.
629963 632625 Mr Jacks, by the way,<br />aren't you a Laker fan?
632699 633757 I am a Laker fan.
633867 636301 My mom is having this thing on Sunday.<br />I can't use these.
636369 638132 - Are you serious?<br />- Yeah. Absolutely. You want them?
638204 639535 - These are great seats!<br />- They are great seats.
639639 641197 This is where they<br />bring the hot dogs right to you.
641541 643133 Yes, it is.<br />You are gonna hobnob with celebs.
643209 645177 - You sure that's okay?<br />- Absolutely, it's okay. Yeah.
645278 646973 - Well, thank you, Stu.<br />- Take them. Absolutely.
647046 648638 - Wow.<br />- Say hey to Kobe for me.
648715 650205 Of course.
654320 655810 Will you help me?
656723 658520 Of course. What can I do for you?
658625 663153 Your trucks are at my house.<br />The men are packing all my things,
663496 666659 private things. Please, make them stop.
673239 675173 - Mrs...<br />- Ganush.
676576 679340 Mrs Ganush, the bank is informing you
679412 683644 of their intent to repossess your property<br />at 325 Brandon Street today.
683750 686810 But this is my home for 30 years.
687754 692020 And I make every payment<br />until the sickness took my eye.
692859 697159 I hope to have more money soon.<br />I just need a little more time. You...
697263 700596 I don't think my manager's going<br />to extend you any more credit.
702335 705862 Please. Won't you try?
710877 713038 - Okay.<br />- Bless you.
714948 716438 Bless you!
722055 723545 We have<br />an elderly woman asking
723623 726114 for an extension on her mortgage payment.
726226 729718 She's on a fixed income,<br />and she's had some medical problems.
729796 732788 There's gotta be something<br />we can do to help her.
739472 742873 Well, apparently,<br />we've already granted her two extensions.
743142 746942 And, you know, on this type of foreclosure,<br />we seize the trapped equity
747046 749480 and the bank makes a sizable amount in fees.
749582 751777 We would have to<br />throw her out of her house.
751884 753579 It's a tough decision.
754921 756252 Your call.
781614 783275 I'll take care of it.
803469 806438 Mrs Ganush. I'm sorry, Mrs Ganush,
806539 809303 but another extension on the loan<br />is out of the question.
809375 811866 - What?<br />- I would like to help, but it is in the bank's...
811978 816381 No, please, this is my home.<br />Where will I live?
817717 820447 You list your granddaughter as a reference.<br />Maybe you could stay with her.
820553 822145 I would not burden her.
823656 826318 And there are several fine assisted<br />living facilities for the elderly...
826392 831227 A nursing home? No, I would<br />never live in one of those places.
833299 834994 I'm really sorry.
859759 862523 I am proud woman, Miss Brown,
862929 865864 and never have I begged for anything.
868034 871265 But now, I beg for you.
871771 874103 - I humble myself before you.<br />- Mrs Ganush. Mrs Ganush, please.
874207 876869 - Please stand up.<br />- I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.
876943 879935 On my mother's grave, I beg you!
880446 884212 Please let go. Let go! Security! Stop!
886219 889052 - Over here, Billy! Over here!<br />- We're coming.
897563 899963 You shame me.
909542 913239 I beg you, and you shame me.
914580 916741 I think your business<br />is finished here, ma'am.
917483 918916 Let's go.
925258 926418 Mrs Ganush...
933766 935324 Get out of here!
938604 940595 - Come on, ma'am.<br />- Let's go.
945945 948743 I never saw anything quite like that before.
949348 950906 Are you okay?
952852 955343 You handled that just right, you know.
966199 968929 - Good night. See you tomorrow.<br />- Okay.
972038 975269 You know, I just finished<br />going over this McPherson loan.
975374 978775 - This is very impressive work.<br />- Thanks.
978878 981312 Would you mind taking this<br />home tonight and finishing it up?
981380 984645 Because I would like to show it<br />to the regional veep in the morning.
984717 986514 - I would love to.<br />- Great.
986619 987984 Thank you.
988054 991546 And as far as that<br />assistant manager's position goes,
992325 994623 you're at the top of the list.
1108407 1111342 You shamed me.
1235801 1237962 I beat you, you old bitch!
1267666 1268826 No!
1296695 1299789 Lamia.
1314280 1318307 Soon it will be you<br />who comes begging to me.
1349648 1352674 - She's right over there.<br />- Thank you, thank you.
1353252 1354480 Hey!
1359325 1361316 Once they send some officers<br />over to have a talk with her,
1361427 1362689 she's not gonna be<br />bothering you any more, okay?
1362761 1364251 So don't even think about her.
1364363 1365887 And I'm gonna call<br />Mr Jacks and just make sure
1365998 1368159 he can have somebody walk you<br />to your car every night, okay?
1368267 1369495 Okay.
1370035 1373835 I just thank God you're okay.<br />You are okay, right?
1374673 1375935 I'm fine.
1377276 1379608 What? What's the matter?
1380779 1385409 It's just that maybe I could have<br />gotten her another extension on her loan.
1385517 1386882 Chris, no, don't do that.
1386952 1390115 You said the bank granted this woman<br />two extensions already, right?
1390222 1392281 I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage,<br />you lose your house.
1392391 1395053 What does this woman expect?<br />It's not your fault.
1395127 1397687 You can't beat yourself up over it.
1404637 1407401 I mean, what'd she expect?<br />It's not your fault.
1407473 1410636 And regardless of what you may<br />or may not have been able to do,
1410910 1413538 that's still no justification for her...
1421820 1424050 What is it? What's wrong?
1424590 1427559 - Did you hear that?<br />- What?
1427993 1429483 Really? You didn't?
1430996 1432657 No. What?
1437002 1440165 I know this is gonna sound weird,<br />but I wanna get my fortune read.
1441240 1445176 Now? Are you kidding?
1446845 1449678 Come on, Chris. I'll read your fortune for you.
1450182 1452173 In the near future,<br />we are gonna get in the car,
1452284 1455185 - go home and relax.<br />- Clay, I really want to do this.
1455287 1458017 Why? Because of<br />what happened with that old woman?
1458123 1461422 Chris, I really think<br />we should just get you home now.
1463195 1464787 Can you do this for me?
1472705 1475538 I pray to God<br />none of my students see me here.
1477042 1480273 The only class I'll be able to<br />teach is, like, Hypocrisy 101.
1483048 1485107 Yeah, there's so many things<br />to choose from here.
1485217 1488778 Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,<br />which is a weird little dried monkey head.
1488887 1491048 Wait, no, never mind, he's got one.
1493726 1496058 I am Rham Jas, seer.
1496895 1501730 - I'm Christine and this is Clay.<br />- But you probably already knew that, right?
1503402 1506337 - Just kidding.<br />- How can I help you?
1506405 1510000 I would like to have my fortune read.<br />Can you do that?
1510075 1513135 I have the ability to see certain energies.
1513245 1516840 Sometimes these energies<br />are a foretoken of things to come.
1516915 1518177 $60, please.
1518250 1520013 - Seriously?<br />- Yes.
1520085 1523748 Sixty... Doesn't that seem a little<br />steep for this sort of thing?
1523856 1528657 - If you're not serious, please go.<br />- All right. Come on, Chris.
1528761 1531321 Wait, wait! I'll... I'll pay.
1531430 1534593 No, you know what?<br />You know what? I got it. I got it.
1535267 1539431 - There you go.<br />- Platinum card. Very good.
1545544 1546772 Thank you.
1547346 1548745 - Here, here, baby.<br />- Thanks.
1548847 1550041 Sure.
1552451 1555215 Uh-uh. Please.
1556121 1557110 Okay.
1557856 1560723 So, you wish to know<br />something of your destiny.
1560793 1561953 - Yes.<br />- Very good.
1562061 1563551 Let's see what the fates have in store.
1563629 1565893 You know, Freud said<br />destiny was not an act of fate,
1565964 1567727 but rather something<br />created by our subconscious
1567800 1569597 to control our conscious choices.
1569701 1574729 That's true. But we cannot attempt to<br />understand the world by intellect alone.
1575407 1577136 - Carl Jung.<br />- Yes.
1577810 1580870 From his treatise <i>Psychological Types.</i>
1580979 1584380 - So...<br />- Jung, the New Agers' favourite psychologist.
1584483 1586747 Because he wasn't<br />afraid to bring God into the equation.
1586819 1588116 Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God into...
1588220 1591621 - Clay, Clay, come on.<br />- Let's do it. I know. Come on. Let's start.
1591723 1593486 - Shall we?<br />- I'm ready.
1594126 1595252 Very well. Please, give me your hand.
1595327 1596988 Okay.
1597496 1599225 This way. Okay.
1606004 1607494 You work with money.
1608841 1609899 That's right.
1611243 1613609 And you've recently lost something.
1615781 1621242 - No, I don't think so.<br />- No. No, you haven't lost anything.
1622354 1624686 But something's been taken from you.
1625591 1626751 No.
1627359 1630294 - A button.<br />- Oh, my God. Yes!
1631196 1633027 Well, anyone can see<br />she's missing a button! So what?
1633132 1634360 But, Clay, it was really strange.
1634466 1636866 The old woman today,<br />she took a button from my sleeve.
1636969 1640803 - Why would she do that?<br />- If you would both please just be quiet!
1713445 1716608 - I think that's enough for tonight.<br />- What's wrong?
1716715 1722244 I'm tired, and I see it's become quite late.<br />I will, of course, refund your money.
1722354 1724879 Wait, wait, wait! Did you see something?
1726458 1728085 A dark spirit has come upon you.
1728193 1729626 - What do you mean?<br />- Well, he's...
1729728 1731593 Did you blaspheme the dead<br />while visiting a graveyard?
1731697 1733756 - No!<br />- Did you play with a Ouija board
1733865 1735696 or consort with those<br />who practise the black arts?
1735801 1737098 All right, take it easy, man. Come on.
1737202 1739227 Wait. Clay, Clay, Clay. No. No, I didn't.
1739972 1742133 Perhaps someone has cursed you.
1748547 1752313 - Then how did he know all that?<br />- Know what? That you lost a button?
1753151 1754641 And by the way,<br />he didn't really know that much.
1754753 1756653 He makes a couple<br />of good guesses, then he...
1756755 1759656 He stirs you up, and then he leaves you<br />with all these questions
1759758 1762318 and, conveniently, his business card.
1762995 1765486 Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.
1765897 1768991 But he didn't want the money.<br />He tried to give it back, remember?
1769101 1772832 Well, he sort of tried,<br />but in the end, he took it, didn't he?
1775841 1777331 I guess so.
1801333 1802595 I gotta go meet<br />the guy that's towing your car,
1802701 1803690 so you gonna be okay?
1803835 1806099 - Yeah.<br />- All right. Kitty, take care of her.
1806204 1807865 - I'll see you in about an hour. Love you.<br />- Okay.
1808006 1809200 Okay.
1990622 1991884 Damn it.
2037435 2039096 - Here. Put that on your lip.<br />- Thank you.
2039237 2042673 I can't believe she came to the house.<br />This is so nuts. I'm calling the cops.
2042774 2045902 - It wasn't her.<br />- Who was it then?
2046011 2049208 - I don't know. I couldn't see who it was.<br />- Of course it was her. It had to be her.
2049281 2051215 No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!
2051283 2053444 It was somebody.<br />Chris, it had to be somebody.
2053585 2055018 The lights were out.<br />You just couldn't see who it was,
2055120 2058283 - but I'm guessing it was...<br />- Clay, there wasn't anybody here.
2059124 2060853 Then who did this?
2061793 2064023 Who hit you in the face?
2066197 2067357 Huh?
2071469 2074370 I think it's just a reaction to<br />her being attacked earlier in the day.
2074472 2076963 Yeah.<br />Classic symptoms of post-traumatic stress.
2077108 2080475 Yeah, she's showing<br />signs of panic and paranoia. So...
2080612 2083046 - Do you want me to walk you out, man?<br />- No, no, no, I'll be fine.
2083148 2084479 All right.
2087819 2089309 Hey, hey.
2090889 2092117 How you doing?
2092223 2093383 - Better.<br />- Yeah?
2093491 2095550 Especially after<br />the doctor explained it to me.
2095660 2097594 He said that victims of violence,
2097662 2100130 - they re-experience.<i>..</i><br />- Re-experience their trauma.
2100498 2103899 I misinterpreted it to be<br />something more than it was.
2104836 2108328 - Happens.<br />- I just... I feel...
2109474 2111408 - What?<br />- Kind of embarrassed.
2111509 2115240 Are you kidding? No.<br />You never have to be embarrassed with me.
2117582 2118844 Okay?
2124155 2128148 Hey, listen, I was thinking maybe<br />we could take a little trip on Saturday,
2128259 2131023 - get on the train and go to Santa Barbara.<br />- Your folks' cabin.
2131162 2132527 Yeah, if you're up for it, the cabin.
2132664 2134928 - Oh, my God, I would love to!<br />- Yeah? Good.
2135033 2137331 - That'd be so exciting.<br />- Baby, you're gonna love it.
2137435 2138459 - You're gonna love it.<br />- Okay, good.
2138536 2139594 I'm excited for you to see it.
2139704 2141262 - There's trees and it's private.<br />- That would be great.
2141373 2142863 It'll be great. It'll be good.
2143008 2148378 I think we need to.<br />And we can just... We can just talk and stuff.
2276241 2277503 What?
2278910 2282846 - What's the matter?<br />- I couldn't... I couldn't wake up.
2283815 2288184 It's okay. Okay.<br />Come here. It was just a dream.
2300865 2303595 Baby, that's the rental car<br />they dropped off this morning.
2303701 2305328 - Okay? Sure.<br />- Thanks.
2306204 2308263 - Love you.<br />- Love you, too.
2310175 2314202 Hey, baby, try not to piss off<br />any old ladies today, okay?
2333064 2334554 Hey, Christine?
2335066 2337500 - What, are you just getting here?<br />- What are you, the hall monitor?
2337569 2339901 Ha, ha. Very funny, Christine.
2340738 2342365 What's this?
2343007 2344668 What do you want?
2344742 2348007 I need you to finish teaching<br />me the loan procedures.
2349914 2352849 I've got a lot on my mind.<br />Can we do this tomorrow?
2352917 2354179 - Sure.<br />- Okay.
2354252 2356516 I'll just tell Mr Jacks<br />that you don't have the time right now.
2356588 2359921 - Maybe he can tell me.<br />- No, no! Okay, I'll do it.
2360425 2361687 Okay.
2362927 2366192 We were going over<br />the asset-based lending guidelines.
2366264 2371258 Right. Let's say your client is a company<br />that can't get traditional bank financing.
2382547 2384777 - And?<br />- And.<i>..</i>
2389954 2391285 And?
2393458 2394789 And...
2397228 2400288 And get your filthy pig knuckle off my desk!
2408439 2410930 Christine Blood... Brown.
2411809 2414073 Christine. Your nose.
2415580 2417138 Sure, can you hold?
2417282 2419614 - Let me help you.<br />- No, no, I've got it under control.
2419984 2421975 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
2423321 2425653 God! Oh, my God! Stop it!
2426591 2427819 Mr Jacks!
2427959 2429654 - Did I get any in my mouth?<br />- Oh, my God!
2429794 2432991 - Did I get any in my mouth?<br />- Let me take you over here to get clean.
2433097 2436430 I'm so sorry! Oh, my God!
2436501 2439163 - What was that about?<br />- It's just a nosebleed.
2439304 2442501 - Did I get any in my mouth?<br />- We'll clean you up. We have antiseptic.
2495360 2496827 What is it?
2500832 2503892 Hi. I came to see Sylvia Ganush. Is she here?
2504535 2506025 Who are you?
2506904 2509498 I'm a friend of hers.
2510174 2511903 - Someone...<br />- Wait.
2514912 2518746 I know who you are.<br />Grandma told me you would come.
2519017 2522350 You are the woman from the bank,<br />the one who took her house.
2522420 2524183 Actually, it was the bank<br />that took the house.
2524255 2526416 I mean, I just work there.
2526758 2530250 In fact, I tried to help your<br />grandma get the house back,
2530361 2531919 but my boss wouldn't let me.
2532030 2535761 Are you going to stand here<br />on my porch and lie to my face?
2541406 2545775 - No.<br />- You used to be a real fat girl, didn't you?
2552450 2554577 - Yeah.<br />- I can tell.
2555620 2557554 You are not welcome here.
2558389 2561290 Wait! Wait. I need to see her.
2561392 2564452 I need her to forgive me.<br />And I'll get her the house back.
2564595 2567564 And you are gonna make everything<br />all right for her, is that it?
2567632 2568792 Yes.
2570268 2571633 Come on.
2586818 2588410 Where is she?
2640538 2644201 - Get her off me! Get her off me!<br />- Come! Don't look.
2645843 2649301 - Grab her shoulder.<br />- Be a man! Lift her up!
2655520 2659217 - Be careful.<br />- Let's roll the dice!
2660024 2663221 Still going to make<br />everything all right for her?
2664662 2667688 You deserve everything<br />that is coming to you.
2674071 2675231 One more time!
2675740 2678834 I believe what plagues you is the Lamia.
2678910 2681174 Lamia, that's the word the old woman used.
2681245 2685238 The Black Goat, only summoned<br />by gypsies for their darkest deeds.
2686050 2691511 For the first three days, the Lamia appears<br />as a nasty spirit that torments its victim.
2691589 2694524 After that, it reveals<br />itself to be a taker of souls,
2694592 2697026 and it comes for the owner<br />of the accursed object.
2697094 2698584 Accursed object. What object?
2698696 2702097 Something taken from the victim,<br />cursed and given back.
2706103 2707400 This?
2709574 2710768 What if I just burn it?
2710908 2713934 I'm afraid no matter<br />what condition the button is in,
2714445 2717937 you would still be the owner.<br />The Lamia would still come to take you.
2718082 2719743 Take me where?
2726457 2730723 - Then how do I get rid of this?<br />- You could attempt to appease the spirit.
2730795 2732729 The simplest way<br />would be a blood offering.
2732797 2736733 A small creature could be sacrificed,<br />a chicken perhaps.
2736801 2738894 No way! Look, I'm a vegetarian.
2738970 2741905 I volunteer at the puppy shelter,<br />for Christ's sake.
2741973 2744066 I don't go around killing animals.
2744141 2746075 You will be surprised<br />what you'll be willing to do
2746143 2748304 when the Lamia comes for you.
2750648 2752639 This will show you how.
2768799 2769959 Hi!
2996961 2998656 Here, kitty, kitty.
3020217 3022048 Chris! Chris?
3023721 3024983 Chris?
3026690 3029591 Hey, there you are.<br />What are you doing out here?
3029693 3031354 Baby, I called the bank.<br />They said you left early.
3031428 3034920 You're not answering my calls.<br />Is that blood?
3037668 3040330 No. Why would there be blood?
3040404 3043373 Yeah, baby, there's...<br />There's blood on your sleeve.
3043440 3045499 - Are you bleeding?<br />- No.
3046176 3047370 It was just tomato juice.
3047444 3052177 I was cutting a tomato in the kitchen<br />and it must have gotten on my sleeve.
3054184 3058587 Hey, Chris, why don't we<br />do this dinner another time?
3059456 3062118 You've had a rough couple of days.<br />I think it's better.
3062226 3064285 No, I want to go to the dinner.
3064395 3067728 I know, but are you sure<br />you're feeling all right?
3069533 3071865 Honestly, I haven't been.
3078108 3079700 But I think...
3080044 3082945 I think that everything<br />is gonna be okay now.
3084782 3086409 I really do.
3091288 3092949 What do you think?
3096594 3098323 You look beautiful.
3101899 3105062 - God, it's such a nice day!<br />- It really is. My God.
3105135 3107399 It's gonna be nice inside, too.
3110074 3111974 They're gonna love you.
3114745 3116337 - Clayton.<br />- Hello, Mother.
3116447 3117675 Good to see you. This is Christine.
3117781 3119772 - That's my mom, Trudy.<br />- Hello, Christine.
3119850 3121943 Hello. It's very nice to meet you.
3122286 3124754 - Well.<br />- Please, come in. Come in.
3124822 3125914 Yes.
3126357 3127619 - Hey, Dad, how are you?<br />- Hey, son.
3127691 3129420 Good to see you, sir.
3129493 3131256 This is Christine.<br />Christine, this is my dad, Leonard.
3131328 3132420 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Hi, Maria. Thank you.
3132496 3136091 - You have a beautiful home.<br />- Well, thank you very much.
3136867 3138425 - Can I get you a drink?<br />- Yeah, wine?
3138502 3139867 - Do you guys want?<br />- Sure.
3139970 3143770 - Okay. Come help me.<br />- I'll be right back.
3144141 3146666 - I'll take a Chardonnay!<br />- Yes, dear.
3147611 3150307 - I hope you don't mind.<br />- How thoughtful.
3150381 3152042 - Homemade?<br />- Yes.
3152149 3154947 And what type of cake would you call that?
3155486 3157010 It's called
3158222 3159450 a harvest cake.
3159523 3162617 Is that something you would make on a farm?
3163527 3164721 No.
3166964 3172630 I mean, not any more.<br />We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.
3172703 3175365 - Geese?<br />- Well, right around the harvest time,
3175472 3178566 that's when your goose eggs<br />will make a real dense yolk.
3179143 3181134 It makes for a rich cake.
3183414 3185382 Well, just thank you.
3186383 3188715 - Here we are.<br />- Sorry to interrupt the bonding sesh.
3188819 3190013 - Why don't you join us in the dining room?<br />- Good.
3190087 3192817 - Yeah, let's go. It's right in here.<br />- Okay.
3194358 3195916 - Jeez.<br />- Hecuba.
3196927 3199589 I never did understand<br />that damned animal. I hate cats.
3199697 3203326 That is so strange.<br />Hecuba is usually very sweet.
3203400 3206233 That's okay. I had a cat. I understand.
3206904 3209395 You mean... You mean you have a cat.
3210674 3212005 What do you mean?<br />Did something happen?
3212076 3214101 Unless something happened to him.
3216780 3218941 Well, how am I supposed to know?
3219349 3222512 I mean, you know how cats are.<br />They come and they go.
3225622 3227180 That's true.
3229526 3232461 - Well, should...<br />- Well... Yes. Yes, please.
3233230 3235460 So, how's the coin collection, son?
3235566 3238433 That's my dad's way of saying,<br />"So, you're still a huge nerd?"
3238535 3240867 It's good. It's good.<br />In fact, Christine just got me
3240938 3242906 a 1929 Standing Liberty quarter at her bank.
3242973 3245032 - Really?<br />- Isn't that crazy? Yeah, it's rare.
3245109 3248408 I just think the job of a bank<br />teller must be so difficult,
3248479 3252142 with all that counting and repetition.<br />It must get very tedious.
3252249 3253443 Yes, you're right,
3253951 3255714 - but I'm not a teller.<br />- Oh?
3255786 3257583 Yeah, Mom, I told you.<br />Christine's a loan officer.
3257654 3260987 She handles all the loans<br />for small businesses and homes for her bank.
3261091 3264618 And she's up for this big<br />promotion, so... Right, Chris?
3264728 3267891 If I could close this one account that<br />I'm working on, it would really help.
3267965 3270058 That must be a very important loan.
3270134 3272967 It's the biggest that my branch<br />has ever handled.
3273070 3275231 And how did that come to you?
3275572 3277733 Well, I was reading<br />the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>
3277808 3280106 and came across<br />this medical supply company
3280177 3283613 that was looking to expand<br />but didn't have the liquidity.
3283680 3286581 So I met with their CFO<br />and presented a formula
3286650 3289414 for restructuring<br />some of their long-term debt.
3289486 3292080 Sounds like you've got<br />a lot going for you, Christine.
3292156 3295023 Well, your mother must be very proud of you.
3295259 3296658 I suppose.
3302633 3304601 I don't see much of my mother.
3304668 3307865 - Why is that?<br />- Wow, Mom, that's... It's kind of personal.
3307971 3310030 I'm speaking to Christine.
3313844 3318645 Well, ever since my dad died,<br />she doesn't talk much.
3319116 3325487 She just stays on the farm<br />and keeps to herself because...
3326824 3328291 Because?
3328358 3332124 Because her husband died, Mom,<br />and she just wants to be by herself.
3332196 3335290 - Why don't...<br />- Because my mother's an alcoholic.
3337000 3338024 Oh.
3339536 3341026 I'm sorry.
3342072 3344802 It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.
3345475 3348740 I have to say,<br />I find your honesty very refreshing.
3349646 3352979 My father had a drinking problem,<br />and I was always too ashamed to admit it.
3354218 3356083 You've got backbone.
3356753 3358482 Unlike that last girl he brought by.
3358555 3360147 - What was her name?<br />- Alice.
3360224 3361748 - We don't have to...<br />- Alicia!
3361859 3363986 - Alicia.<br />- She was dreadful, Christine.
3364061 3367155 She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.
3367231 3368357 - That's not really...<br />- They met on the Internet.
3368432 3369524 - There you go.<br />- What is that,
3369600 3370658 - "They met on the Internet"?<br />- Really?
3370734 3372998 - What does that mean?<br />- Am I being too hard on him?
3373070 3374094 No, not at all.
3374204 3375535 - There you go. Thank you very much.<br />- Thanks a lot...
3375606 3377267 You know, I think I will try<br />some of that cake of yours.
3377374 3378705 - ...for tossing me under the bus.<br />- Look at that. It looks great.
3380510 3382740 - You're gonna like it.<br />- It looks so interesting.
3382846 3386213 You only dislike it<br />if you hate delicious things.
3387851 3389842 - Well, that counts us out.<br />- Not my problem.
3391221 3392245 Lovely.
3392356 3393846 Thank you, Christine.<br />This is wonderful.
3393924 3395755 It also changed the subject nicely.
3395859 3397588 Thank you. That looks good!
3398528 3400052 - Harvest cake, huh?<br />- That's right.
3400130 3402530 - We'll have to get this recipe.<br />- It sounds so quaint, doesn't it?
3402599 3404430 Did you hear something?
3404902 3406529 No. You okay?
3407204 3408364 Tasty!
3408639 3411107 - I like it a lot.<br />- I do like it.
3411775 3415905 You know, Mom, when you say we<br />met on the Internet, it's a little misleading.
3434331 3437061 Yes, well you need<br />to do that to find a good mate.
3437134 3438658 - She has a Facebook...<br />- You can't even trust
3438769 3440896 the things you hear or that<br />people write about themselves.
3440971 3442996 - Very nice.<br />- Even the pictures are false half the time.
3443106 3444300 - Isn't that true?<br />- It's true.
3444408 3446433 - It doesn't really count.<br />- I don't think it's a misconception
3446510 3448137 to think that people of good breeding
3448245 3452443 and success should be able to meet<br />potential life partners in a realistic situation.
3452516 3454108 Well, you also have a thing about bars.
3463760 3465523 Would you, Christine?
3467864 3472665 - No. No, of course not.<br />- What? What... But we did.
3472769 3474634 We met at a bar, Chris.<br />What are you talking about?
3474705 3476502 - Oh, my God, that's right!<br />- She...
3476606 3481009 - You two better get your stories straight.<br />- It's not a Klan rally, Mom. It's a bar.
3482713 3487150 Yeah, we met... We met at a bar,<br />and we set up the date on the Internet.
3488118 3491144 You okay? You okay?
3491455 3495983 Some water? Baby, have some...<br />Went down the wrong pipe.
3496960 3498291 Oh, my God!
3510173 3512641 I'm sorry, I don't...<br />There must be a window open.
3513844 3515004 Chris?
3519383 3521214 Okay, I hear you!
3521318 3522808 - What in the hell?<br />- Leave me alone.
3522919 3525319 - Just leave me the hell alone!<br />- Hey! Hey! Chris! Stop it!
3525422 3527515 Baby! There's no one there.
3530160 3531252 Okay.
3533597 3536930 - I think I'd better go.<br />- Yes, I think that would be best.
3537534 3541527 - I know. Wait, Chris...<br />- Don't follow her! She's a sick girl.
3541605 3544039 - Mom, she needs my help.<br />- Let her go.
3546276 3547334 Wait!
3548545 3550445 What's the matter?
3550947 3554940 Look, I did what you said!<br />I killed that little kitty!
3555385 3557216 You're so full of shit!
3557287 3560085 These are elusive and powerful forces<br />we are dealing with.
3560190 3562124 There are no guarantees.
3579643 3582544 We must speak directly to this dark spirit.
3583080 3586811 We must dissuade it from<br />taking your soul, and soon.
3587984 3591886 - I know someone who can help us.<br />- And I'm supposed to trust you?
3591988 3596049 Tomorrow is the third day.<br />After that, the Lamia will come for you.
3596159 3599322 We can't let that happen.<br />But you must understand,
3600397 3603992 the woman who can help us<br />must put herself at great risk.
3604334 3607826 - She will not do that for free.<br />- What do you need from me?
3608171 3610401 $10,000 cash
3611908 3613170 by tomorrow.
3626690 3628419 - Mr Jacks.<br />- Yeah?
3629025 3633359 This is kind of awkward for me,<br />and I know it's not official yet,
3634431 3638128 but I was wondering if I could get<br />an advance for the new position.
3638201 3640431 What, the assistant manager's position?
3640537 3643768 Yes. See, one of my family<br />members is really sick.
3645208 3648268 - They're not gonna die, but they could.<br />- Christine. Christine.
3648378 3653008 There's a problem.<br />The McPherson deal was cancelled last night.
3653116 3654549 - What?<br />- Yeah.
3655218 3658949 Right after I informed the regional office<br />that we had this big loan pending,
3659055 3662547 I find out that they just made<br />their deal over at First National.
3662659 3664524 Now, I gotta call in to see<br />what exactly happened,
3664628 3668564 but right now, this does not<br />look too good for you or for me.
3670133 3674399 So, this assistant manager<br />promotion has been delayed.
3675505 3678474 In fact, you know, I think, with<br />everything that's been happening,
3678575 3681738 I think I'm gonna have<br />to give this job to Stu.
3682646 3684409 Stu. I see.
3685482 3688144 I'm sorry.<br />Look, if you've got family problems,
3688251 3691743 maybe you should take the day off,<br />sort them out and...
3759823 3762986 - So, how much?<br />- $3,800 for everything.
3763126 3765959 - Including my jewellery?<br />- Including.
3766062 3768929 But this stuff is worth<br />so much more than that.
3768999 3773231 Please. This is all I have. I'm begging you.
3774638 3776401 Take it or leave it.
3785015 3786846 Chris? Chris?
3790353 3791513 Baby?
3810707 3813369 I thought you were lactose intolerant.
3814711 3815871 I am.
3817047 3820278 But then I thought,<br />"Screw it, I'm eating ice cream."
3823553 3825214 I paid Rham Jas.
3828725 3831717 What? You're kidding me.
3832562 3834120 I paid him.
3835198 3838224 Why? I mean, I thought<br />that you didn't believe.
3838702 3841694 I don't know what I believe in any more.
3841805 3845571 I really don't,<br />but I know that you believe in this.
3846710 3848337 I know how important it is to you,
3848411 3851812 and I know how much pain<br />this is causing you.
3853383 3856978 And, I also remembered...
3857754 3860484 I remembered a promise that I made
3861591 3863923 the night I fell in love with you.
3864060 3866255 I told myself that I would...
3866996 3870932 I would always look out for you.<br />I'd always take care of you.
3872769 3874259 So I paid him.
3877440 3880273 You remember the night<br />that you fell in love with me?
3880410 3883402 I remember the second<br />I fell in love with you.
3885115 3886514 Oh, my God.
3899629 3901859 You sure you don't<br />want me to go in with you?
3901965 3903398 He said I should come alone.
3903466 3906799 Yeah, I know, I know he did.<br />He told me the same thing.
3943139 3944834 Christine, if you will permit me
3944974 3948137 the pleasure of an introduction,<br />Shaun San Dena.
3951514 3954074 - Welcome.<br />- How do you do?
3955018 3957248 Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.
3957353 3960447 Furthermore, she's personally<br />been touched by the Lamia.
3960523 3965017 I first encountered this spirit<br />many years ago in this very house.
3966362 3968023 And what happened?
3970099 3974934 I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.
3980376 3984142 I have waited these long years
3985215 3988707 for a chance at redeeming myself,
3989219 3992347 a chance to destroy the foul thing.
3993022 3995217 - And...<br />- <i>Teti�ko,</i> please.
4000396 4003388 Tonight, my chance will come.
4004567 4008230 But to summon it, I will need your help.
4009706 4011367 Can you be strong?
4014077 4015408 I'll try.
4020583 4023746 My late husband, Sandor,<br />was also medium.
4024354 4026254 He chose this site to build a house upon
4026389 4030257 because he sensed<br />certain forces at work here.
4031427 4034919 In this place, there is a particular...
4043773 4045263 A particular confluence of forces
4045408 4048536 which allows a doorway to be opened<br />through which we may pass...
4053616 4056881 ...and through which others<br />may pass into our world.
4062625 4064286 Please be seated.
4092622 4093646 What's going on?
4093756 4099490 Everything we're doing is for your<br />own good. Please. Christine, please.
4105101 4106432 Thank you.
4136366 4140359 Once the spirit has entered me,<br />put my hand upon the animal.
4140970 4143530 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes.
4144173 4150203 I force the spirit of the Lamia into the goat.<br />Milos, that's when you strike.
4153216 4154706 I understand.
4165662 4167653 We all must be receptive.
4182578 4186412 - What am I supposed to do?<br />- You must allow the darkness in.
4186549 4190178 You must invite the dead<br />to co-mingle with your spirit.
4191054 4193215 - I'm scared.<br />- Yes.
4194223 4198887 Now repeat these words,<br />"I welcome the dead into my soul."
4202598 4206056 - I welcome the dead into my soul.<br />- You must believe it!
4206836 4209202 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4210707 4213835 - I welcome the dead into my soul.<br />- I welcome the dead into my soul.
4215244 4217371 - I welcome the dead into my soul.<br />- ...into my soul.
4218614 4224018 I welcome the dead into my soul.<br />I welcome the dead into my soul.
4224187 4233562 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4233629 4234857 I welcome the dead...
4237433 4243269 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4243372 4244896 I welcome the dead into...
4248478 4250776 Something else is here with us.
4252415 4253473 Yes.
4282145 4284079 This is not the Lamia.
4284147 4287412 It is the spirit of some
4288084 4291451 unsettled soul from years ago.
4292421 4295481 Sometimes the unsettled<br />ones linger by the door.
4296592 4299254 There are others here, as well.
4309505 4312440 Begone, foolish spirits! Begone!
4326122 4327555 She is coming.
4430793 4433660 Who now inhabits the<br />body of Shaun San Dena?
4437800 4440894 Lamia!
4447009 4449068 Lamia, what is it you desire?
4449145 4453479 I desire the soul of Christine Brown!
4453749 4457446 We will feast upon it<br />as she festers in the grave!
4457520 4460080 No! It was my manager, Jim Jacks!
4460156 4462021 - He was the one! He was...<br />- Silence!
4462124 4466356 Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded<br />from taking this insignificant woman.
4466462 4469363 Surely she is not worthy of your greatness.
4478207 4479606 No!
4483646 4487013 I come for you, Christine.
4489218 4490776 You're mine!
4495992 4497220 No!
4497393 4501193 You tricked me! You black-hearted whore!
4501297 4503857 - Now, Milos, now!<br />- You bitch.
4517246 4519146 Away, unclean spirit.
4535231 4536562 Lamia!
4536665 4541261 As one who summoned you to this circle,<br />I command you to leave this instant.
4547710 4549200 Christine!
4555851 4560379 I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!
4571801 4573428 Shaun San Dena!
4574403 4576371 You must banish the spirit!
4576539 4577563 Yes!
4609972 4611234 Milos!
4612074 4615908 - Oh, my God. I'm okay.<br />- Thank God!
4615978 4617912 - I'm okay.<br />- Unbelievable!
4620516 4622507 - You did it!<br />- Thank God.
4624653 4626018 I tried.
4626122 4627146 Are you okay?
4627923 4629754 Oh, my God. Help me!
4634663 4636426 Call an ambulance.
4640302 4641929 Is she breathing?
4643506 4645030 No.
4648144 4649441 Oh, my gosh.
4690920 4693411 - It's so sad.<br />- Yes.
4693989 4696321 Strange how things work out.
4696392 4700351 She waited 40 years for another<br />chance to overcome the Lamia,
4702097 4706727 and finally, on the last<br />night of her life, she did.
4707603 4710163 No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.
4711407 4714274 The Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.
4714710 4717679 This is our lesson tonight. I'm sorry.
4717746 4719680 - But I saw her get rid of the thing.<br />- No.
4719748 4723047 You saw her drive it from a s�ance.<br />That is all.
4723752 4726778 It will be back.<br />The goat was never slaughtered.
4727590 4729717 When this night is through,
4730526 4734189 the Lamia will come for the owner<br />of the accursed object.
4737866 4742633 Unless, of course, you are no longer<br />the owner. Do you have the button?
4750479 4754210 Make a gift of it and<br />you've given the curse away.
4757886 4759581 Why didn't you tell me this before?
4759655 4763216 Because the Lamia will tear the soul<br />out of whoever you give that to.
4763292 4765817 They'll burn in hell for eternity.
4767596 4770656 And I would have sent them there.
4771267 4773565 And I would be your accomplice.
4775137 4778903 Whatever you decide, you have till morning.
4800029 4801360 Is it over?
4802698 4804029 It's over.
4807870 4808996 Clay!
4813542 4815510 You will burn in hell!
4815878 4820542 You will burn in hell!<br />You bitch, you'll burn in hell!
4821050 4822847 Your turn's coming!
4823385 4825819 - You will burn in hell!<br />- You okay?
4826989 4828354 Holy shit.
4842571 4844562 Okay, you sure you're still okay<br />about the Santa Barbara trip?
4844707 4845731 - Yeah, I'm fine.<br />- Yeah?
4845841 4849743 - And what time should I get you?<br />- It's better if I meet you at the station.
4849878 4851345 There's something I've gotta do on the way.
4851413 4853506 I can do it. You want me<br />to do it on my way to...
4853582 4856016 No! No. I've got it under control.
4856719 4859586 We'll meet at, like, 7:30 at the...<br />Wait! Where's my envelope?
4859722 4862190 - What envelope?<br />- It was in my purse. I just had it!
4862257 4864350 - It's just an envelope.<br />- No, it's gotta be here!
4864426 4867361 It's here, so we'll find it eventually.
4868030 4869361 - Oh, my God.<br />- Okay.
4869431 4872093 I thought I'd lost it. Okay.
4873435 4875426 Bye. 7:30. Don't be late.
4893455 4895946 Dad, can we go to the Angel game?
4896458 4900087 - What about the Dodgers?<br />- We're only gonna be in town for a few days.
4902898 4906129 I'm sure if I just tell him<br />how much I care about you,
4906268 4908566 I mean, he's gotta understand.
4912307 4914571 Are you sure<br />you don't want anything else?
4914643 4915632 No.
4915778 4918906 So you're just gonna sit here<br />drinking coffee all night long.
4918981 4922246 Yes. Maybe! What's it to you?
4922317 4926549 Honey, I make my money on tips.<br />Coffee drinkers don't tip.
4926655 4930557 Honey, just keep the coffee coming<br />or I'll give you a tip you won't forget.
4972367 4976098 Oh, my gosh. What a delightful surprise.
4977039 4979769 You're the sweetest person in the world.
4982444 4984105 Never mind what it's about, Stu.
4984213 4986181 Just get here in 10 minutes<br />or I'm gonna tell Mr Jacks
4986281 4988476 something you don't want me to tell him.
4988550 4990882 <i>Oh, yeah? Like what?</i>
4991220 4994951 Well, for starters, that you stole<br />the McPherson loan file off my desk
4995057 4998390 and gave it to First National.<br />Now you got nine minutes!
5003365 5005560 - Give me another.<br />- Seriously?
5013909 5018676 Oh, God, Christine, please don't tell on me.<br />I mean, if my dad ever finds out...
5018747 5022046 - Just tell me what you want.<br />- I need to give something to you.
5022150 5024243 - A little gift.<br />- A gift?
5025721 5028019 But I don't understand.<br />I thought you called me down here
5028090 5029990 because I gave that loan to First National...
5030092 5033220 Look, you don't need to understand.<br />Just shut up!
5035163 5037393 Now, this gift that I'm giving you,<br />it'll become your property.
5037499 5040093 You'll be the owner, all right?
5042938 5044235 Okay.
5049611 5050737 Okay.
5053949 5055246 What?
5056685 5057743 Forget it.
5059121 5061248 But I thought you wanted to give it to me<br />'cause of the loan stuff.
5061356 5062721 Just leave.
5065861 5068796 Okay. Thank you so much, Christine.
5075571 5077232 - But you're not gonna tell my dad, right?<br />- Go!
5077306 5078398 Okay.
5089318 5091309 Who does deserve this?
5112174 5114267 Well? Is it possible?
5115510 5118570 There are gypsy blessings<br />bestowed upon the dead.
5118680 5120773 They give gifts to their departed
5120916 5125182 to curry favour with the deceased's soul,<br />for, truly, the soul never dies.
5127022 5132016 Yes. I do believe you can give the curse<br />to someone who has passed on,
5132361 5135819 <i>but you must make a formal gift</i><br /><i>of the accursed object to the deceased</i>.
5135931 5139628 I'll do better than that.<br />I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!
5140302 5141701 I'm gonna get some...
5248410 5250435 I'm giving it back to you!
5252380 5254575 You're gonna take this thing.
5256118 5258609 Are you gonna take this thing?
5260989 5262547 Take it!
5275670 5278503 That's the last of my hair you're getting!
5283912 5289942 I, Christine Brown,<br />do hereby make a formal gift of this button
5290018 5292350 to you, Sylvia Ganush!
5294256 5296190 Choke on it, bitch!
5311206 5312673 Goodbye.
5402063 5405032 <i>Hi, It's Christine.</i><br /><i>Leave a message and I'll call you back.</i>
5405767 5408099 <i>Christine, it's Jim, Jim Jacks</i>.
5408203 5409568 <i>I'm sorry I'm calling so early,</i>
5409638 5414200 <i>but last night, I found some troubling</i><br /><i>information about our friend Stu Rubin.</i>
5414476 5417934 <i>Apparently, he stole your</i><br /><i>file on the McPherson loan</i>
5418046 5421379 <i>and then tried to broker</i><br /><i>his own deal at First National.</i>
5421449 5423417 <i>I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.</i>
5423485 5426147 <i>And we wouldn't have either,</i><br /><i>except that an hour ago,</i>
5426254 5430054 <i>he came by my house and tried</i><br /><i>to pin the whole thing on you</i>.
5431126 5434653 <i>After I confronted him about</i><br /><i>a few inconsistencies in his story,</i>
5434763 5439132 <i>he broke down crying and, well,</i><br /><i>we won't be seeing him around any more</i>.
5440268 5443499 <i>So I just wanted you to know that,</i><br /><i>come Monday morning</i>,
5443605 5447336 <i>that assistant manager's</i><br /><i>position will be waiting for you</i>.
5459154 5461588 <i>Passenger Benson,</i><br /><i>please meet your party</i>
5461656 5463749 <i>at the concourse ticket counter.</i>
5466428 5467861 - <i>Welcome to Union Station.</i><br />- Cookie, miss?
5467963 5469521 - No, thanks.<br />- <i>We appreciate you choosing</i>

5488216 5489877 Hi. Good morning.
5490218 5493381 - I'm sorry, we're not open.<br />- I just... I just want this coat.
5493521 5494545 We're not open yet.
5494689 5498716 My boyfriend and I are<br />taking this really special trip this morning.
5500061 5501153 Please?
5503999 5506900 <i>Northbound Surfliner,</i><br /><i>service to Van Nuys,</i>
5507068 5510003 <i>Simi Valley, Oxnard, Santa Barbara,</i>
5510071 5512005 - <i>San Luis Obispo...</i><br />- Clay?
5512073 5514564 - Hey!<br />- Hey! Oh, man! Hi.
5514676 5517076 God, I'm so glad you're here.<br />So many things I wanna tell you.
5517212 5518338 Wait, there's something I wanna say
5518413 5521348 - while I have it straight in my head.<br />- Okay. Go ahead.
5521416 5523884 You never stopped believing in me.
5524719 5526414 Thank you for that.
5527722 5532250 And there's something else,<br />something that I couldn't admit to before.
5532927 5537864 I could have given Mrs Ganush<br />another extension on her loan, but I didn't.
5540035 5543562 It was my decision, and it was wrong of me.
5553615 5555549 You have such a good heart.
5558086 5559610 You're so beautiful right now.
5562290 5564724 - Do you like my new coat?<br />- I do. I really do.
5564793 5566454 - What happened to the old one, though?<br />- I threw it out.
5566594 5569222 - And I never want to see it again.<br />- Oh, no.
5569464 5573298 That's too bad, because I... Look<br />what I found. I found this in the car.
5573768 5575133 I thought...
5575637 5578071 And I thought maybe you could...
5578940 5581067 I thought maybe you could sew it back on.
5581142 5584305 And I think you might have<br />my Standing Liberty quarter,
5584446 5586971 'cause the envelopes kind of look the same.
5587082 5589573 Chris, what's wrong?
5590585 5592917 - Oh, my God!<br />- Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
5593588 5595385 - Oh, God.<br />- Hey, hey. Hey! Hey!
5595490 5597822 Stop! Chris! Oh, God!
5599060 5603394 Hey! Hey! Hey, hey, no!<br />Hey! Oh, God, no!
5608503 5610164 Hey, no!
5615910 5617172 Help me!
5621683 5622911 Help me!
5623852 5625342 Help me!
5626187 5628178 Help me, please!
