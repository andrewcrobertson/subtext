412596 414806 Stu, you mean, the new guy ?<br />- I know he's new,
414759 417387 but he is also quite aggresive,<br />I really like that.
417402 420613 You know, Stu is someone who's<br />not afraid to crunch the numbers.
420525 421651 Make the tough decisions.

424210 427422 I'll let you know, as soon as<br />I decide, ok?
428174 431302 In the meantime, take me through<br />all long qualifying procedures,

558927 564057 who could really help you socially and<br />as a result in your career.

634897 641195 This rucks came to my house and pasted<br />on all my things..private things.
641143 643312 Please, make them stop.
648513 650473 Mrs...<br />- Ganush.
651756 657220 Mrs. Ganush, the bank is informing you,<br />they intend to repossess your property...
657043 658919 ..at 325 Brandon Street today
658884 661804 But that is my house for 30 years.
663009 667430 And I make every payment, until this<br />sickness took my eye.
667855 671817 I hope to have more money soon, I just<br />need a little more time.
671779 675074 I don't think my manager's gonna<br />extend you anymore credit
676585 680840 Please,<br />won't you try?
684955 687750 Ok.<br />- Bless u.
688840 690050 Bless u.
695848 699518 We have an elderly woman, asking for an<br />extension on her mortgage payments.
699652 702906 She's on a fixed income and<br />she had some medical problems.
702976 705061 There got to be something we can do<br />to help her.
712707 715794 Well, apparently we already granted<br />her two extensions.
715952 719622 And you know, in these kind of foreclosure<br />we seize the trapped aqua-date.
719516 721935 And the bank makes a sizeable<br />amount in fees.
722199 723909 We have to throw her<br />out of her house?
724442 725693 It's a tough decision.
727445 728946 Your call.
753075 754785 I will take care of it.
774059 774935 Mrs Ganush...
775301 776803 I'm sorry, Mrs. Ganush.
776783 779911 But another extension on<br />the loan is out of the question
779826 781662 What?<br />- I would like to help,
781628 784965 but it isn't...<br />- No..Please, this is my house.
785072 787033 Where would I live?
787515 789309 You used your granddaughter<br />as reference
789278 790320 Maybe you could stay with her?
790398 792234 I would not burden her.
792922 795883 And there are several fine,<br />living facilities...
795805 800894 A nursing home?<br />No, I would never live in one of those places.
801892 803644 I really sorry.
828404 831156 I'm..proud woman with<br />this problem
831367 834537 And never ever begged for anything.
836172 839592 But now, I beg infront you..
839576 842871 I humble..I can sit for you..<br />- Mrs. Ganush, please stand up.
842780 846158 I pray for you, on my mother's grave...
846265 849268 I beg you<br />- Please, let go, let go!
849148 851275 Security!<br />Stop!
852872 855165 Over here,Billy. Over here.<br />- I'm coming.
864325 867453 You..shamed me...
875458 879379 I beg you and you shamed me
880945 882989 I think your business is<br />finished here, ma'am.
883428 884471 Let's go.
890516 891768 Mrs Ganush...
902811 904938 It's alright, ma'am.<br />Let's go!
910780 913157 I never saw anything quite like<br />that before.
914023 914941 You okay?
917227 919229 You handled that just right, you know?
930283 932535 Good night!<br />See you tomorrow.
936210 939213 You know, I just finished going over<br />this McPherson loan.
939133 941177 This is very impressive work.
941296 942088 Thanks.
942337 944965 Would you mind taking this home tonight<br />and finishing it up...
944899 947819 ..because I would like to show to the Regional<br />VP in the morning.
947903 949530 I would love to.<br />- Really?
949705 950873 Thank you.
951027 954780 Oh, and as far as that Asst. Manager's<br />position goes..
955112 956822 You're at the top of the list.
1067003 1070382 You've shamed me.
1071768 1074188 You will get what you deserve!
1186983 1188902 I beat you, you bitch!
1262192 1264027 Soon it will be you!
1264074 1266118 You will come begging to me.
1305603 1307438 We asked to send some officers over<br />to talk with her,
1307405 1308781 She's not gonna bother you anymore.
1308766 1310100 Incase, don't even think about her.
1310167 1311460 And I'm gonna call Mr. Jacks and...
1311569 1313822 Just make sure he walks you to<br />your car every night, ok ?
1314172 1315048 - Ok.
1316094 1320223 You say, you're okay.<br />You're okay, right?
1320339 1321507 I'm fine.
1322702 1325246 What, what's the matter?
1326307 1330811 It's just that..may be I could have got<br />her another extension.
1330672 1332215 Chris, no,<br />don't do that.
1332194 1335072 You said, the bank granted this woman<br />two extensions already, right?
1335278 1337280 I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage<br />you will loose your house...
1337239 1339325 what's this woman expect?<br />It's not your fault.
1339883 1341885 Can't beat yourself up over it.
1365793 1368546 What is it?<br />What's wrong?
1368476 1370061 Did you hear that?
1369998 1370999 - What?
1371760 1373387 Really? You didn't?
1374483 1376694 - No, what?
1380209 1381794 I know this is gonna sound weird,
1381731 1383858 but I wanna get my fortune, right!
1385616 1388285 Now, are you kidding?
1389581 1392292 Come on Chris,<br />I read your fortune for you.
1392384 1395762 Eh..in the near future, we gonna<br />get in the car, go home & relax.
1395628 1396754 I really need to do this.
1397550 1399594 Why, because of what happened<br />with that woman?
1400153 1402989 Chris, I really think we should just<br />get to home now.
1404839 1406549 Can you do this for me?
1414730 1416774 Pray to god,<br />none of my students see me here...
1418455 1422417 Only class I'll be able to teach,like,<br />hypocracy one on one.
1424622 1426332 So many things to choose from here,
1426304 1427930 unfortunately not one am looking for...
1427906 1429491 ..which is a weird little dried monkey head.
1429588 1431715 Oh, wait, never mind!<br />He's got one.
1434634 1437470 I'm Rham Jas.<br />Seer.
1437517 1439394 I'm Christine,<br />and this is Clay.
1439520 1441438 You probaly already knew that, right?
1443644 1444812 Just kidding.
1445726 1448771 How can I help you?<br />- I would like have my fortune, right?
1448851 1450561 Can you do that?
1450532 1452993 - I have the abilities to see<br />certain energies.
1452976 1456479 Sometimes these energies, are foretell<br />to things to come.
1456379 1457964 $60, please.
1457941 1459943 - Seriously?<br />- Yes.
1459903 1460862 60...
1461385 1463262 Doesn't that seem little cheap<br />for this weird thing?
1463508 1467178 If your not serious...<br />Please, go.
1467072 1468323 Alright.<br />C'mon, Chris.
1468433 1469601 Wait, wait, I'll pay.
1469594 1473265 Oh, you know what,<br />I got it.
1473159 1474785 I got it.
1476403 1478739 Platinum card, very good.
1483611 1485030 Thank you.
1485573 1487617 Here, here.<br />- Thanks.
1491340 1492675 Ah..ah, please.
1496186 1498939 So, you wish to know something about<br />your destiny?
1498869 1499829 - Yes.
1499830 1501832 Very good, lets see what the fate<br />has in store!
1501792 1504086 You know, Freud said destiny was not<br />a act of fate...
1504035 1507496 But rather s'thing created by subconscious to<br />control our conscious choices.
1507519 1509063 That's true!
1509041 1512294 But we cannot attempt to understand<br />the world, by intellect alone.
1512204 1514707 Oh, Karl Jung.<br />- Yes.
1515208 1518211 From his teachings,<br />"Psycological Types"
1518131 1519090 So...
1519172 1521633 Jung, new-age's favourite psychologist.
1521576 1523828 - Because he wasn't afraid to bring God<br />into the equation
1523778 1525697 Wow! He wasn't afraid to bring God...
1525660 1528663 Clay, Clay..c'mon !<br />- Ok, I know..c'mon, let's start
1528543 1529294 Shall we?
1529305 1531015 I'm ready.<br />- Ok.
1531227 1534480 Please, give me your hand<br />- Okay.
1542400 1543985 You work with money.
1545003 1546255 That's right.
1547446 1549364 And you recently lost something?
1551411 1554163 No,<br />No, I don't think so.
1554093 1556596 - No..no,<br />you haven't lost anything...
1558218 1560721 but something has been taken<br />from you.
1561422 1562673 No.
1563264 1565141 A button.<br />- Oh my God.
1565267 1566310 Yes.
1566949 1568659 Why would he say she's missing<br />a button, so what?
1568711 1569879 Clay, this was really strange!
1569872 1572250 The old woman from today, she took<br />a button from my sleeve.
1572194 1575740 Why would she do that?<br />- You both, please be just quiet?
1645561 1647563 I think that's enough for tonight.
1647523 1648691 What's wrong?
1648885 1651888 I'm tired and I see it's<br />become quite late.
1652089 1655008 I will of course refund your money.<br />- Wait, wait ...
1655132 1656676 Did you see something?
1658015 1660935 A dark spirit has come upon you.<br />- What do you mean?
1660979 1663273 Oh, you...<br />- You...the dead or visiting the graveyard?
1663261 1664262 No.
1664263 1667057 - You play the Ouija board or sort with<br />who practise the black art?
1666986 1669113 Alright, take it easy,man. C'mon!<br />No, Wait..wait.
1669028 1670029 No, no..I didn't!
1671070 1673573 Perhaps, someone has cursed you.
1679000 1681002 Then how did he know all that?
1680962 1683048 Know what?<br />Did you lost a button?
1684086 1685379 By the way, he didn't really<br />know that much,
1685367 1686869 He makes a couple of good guesses...
1686849 1690186 He stirs you up and leaves you<br />all these questions.
1690133 1693010 And conveniently, his business card.
1693137 1695764 Come on, Chris.<br />He's a scam artist.
1695820 1698823 But he didn't want the money, he tried<br />to give it back, remember?
1699264 1702642 Well, he sorta tried. But in the end<br />he took it, didn't?
1705471 1706889 I guess so.
1729979 1732315 I gotta go tow in the car,<br />you gonna be ok?
1732222 1733515 Yeah.<br />- Alright?
1733504 1736465 Kitty, care for her.<br />- I'm see you in an hour.
1956806 1958516 Here, put that on your lip.<br />- Thank you.
1958487 1960072 I can't beleive she came to the house.
1960049 1961926 This is so nasty..<br />I'm calling the cops
1961892 1964603 It wasn't her<br />- Who was it then?
1964735 1967029 I don't know, I couldn't see<br />who was.
1966978 1968479 Ofcourse, it's her.<br />Had to be her.
1968459 1970461 No, Clay.<br />It wasn't anyone.
1970421 1972507 It was somebody<br />Chris, there had to be somebody
1972464 1974174 The lights were out, so I couldn't see<br />who it was but I guess...
1974145 1976523 Clay, there wasn't anybody here.
1977189 1979024 Then, who did this?
1980313 1982441 Who...<br />Who hit you in the face?
1989084 1992504 I think, it's just reaction of her being<br />attacked earlier in the day.
1992407 1994826 - Yeah, classic symptoms of<br />post-traumatic stress.
1994770 1998065 - Yeah, she showing signs of panicking,<br />apparently yeah, so...
1997934 2000603 Let me walk you out.<br />- No, no, no...I'm fine.
2000537 2001580 - Alright.
2008106 2010525 How you doing?<br />- Better.
2010709 2012836 Especially after the doctor explained<br />it to me.
2012791 2016753 He..he said that victims of violence,<br />they re-experience trauma
2017116 2020703 I misinterpreted it to be something<br />more than it was.
2021041 2022125 It happens.
2023124 2025543 I just.., I feel...
2026407 2029702 kind of embarrassed.<br />- Are you kidding? No...
2029691 2031484 You never have to be embarrassed<br />with me.
2039902 2043990 Listen, I was thinking may be we could<br />take a little trip on saturday
2043868 2045828 Get on the train and go<br />to Santa Barbara.
2045790 2047875 Your folks cabin?<br />- Yeah, if you aren't afraid of the cabin
2047832 2050167 Oh, my God..I would love to!<br />Yeah, okay.
2050155 2052782 That would be so exciting.<br />- Oh baby, you gonna love it.
2052718 2053469 You gonna love it.
2053479 2055147 I'll make sure you see this trees..<br />and...
2055121 2057957 It's private, it would be great,<br />it would be good...
2057884 2061387 And I think we need to..we can..<br />We can just talk.
2062930 2064306 or...fuck!
2184753 2185879 What?
2187275 2188276 What's wrong?
2188837 2190589 I couldn't...<br />I couldn't wake up!
2192042 2194794 It's ok, ok.<br />Come here.
2194964 2196257 It's just a dream.
2208381 2210758 Oh baby, that's the rent-a-car, they<br />dropped off this morning.
2211023 2212859 - Thanks<br />Sure.
2213386 2215513 I love you<br />- I love you too.
2217311 2221773 Hey baby...try not to piss off<br />any old ladies today, ok.
2239657 2242493 Hey, Christine. What...<br />you just getting here?
2242420 2243713 What you the hour monitor?
2243701 2246037 Haha, very funny, Christine.
2245985 2247820 Oh, What's this?
2248948 2250116 What do you want?
2250270 2253022 I'm here to finish me teaching<br />the loan procedures.
2255315 2257776 I have got a lot on my mind.<br />Can we do this tommorrow?
2257959 2259418 - Sure.<br />Okay.
2259400 2262361 I will just tell Mr.Jacks, you don't have<br />the time right now. Maybe...
2262444 2265280 No, no.<br />Ok, I'll do it.
2265287 2266455 Ok.
2268131 2270758 We were going over the asset based<br />lending guidelines.
2271014 2271889 - Alrite.
2272295 2276633 Let's say your client is a company that<br />can't get traditional bank financing.
2286632 2289176 And?<br />- And...
2293801 2297888 And?<br />- And...
2300649 2304319 Hey, get your filthy pig knuckles<br />off my desk!
2311621 2314457 Christine...blood!<br />Brown.
2314785 2317579 Christine...your nose.
2318069 2320446 Yeah, sure...can you hold?
2321192 2324654 Here, let me help you<br />- No, it's going outta control.
2325557 2326892 What is with you?
2327760 2329595 Mr. Jacks?<br />Did I get any in my mouth?
2329562 2331022 Oh, my God!<br />Did I get any in my mouth?
2331444 2333363 Let me check & get you cleaned.
2333527 2336989 I'm so sorry!<br />Oh, my God!
2337171 2339173 What was that about?<br />It's just a nose bleed.
2339454 2341039 Did I get any in my mouth?
2393638 2395014 What is it?
2398844 2402097 Hi, I came to see Sylvia Ganush,<br />is she here?
2402327 2403537 Who are you?
2404410 2407330 I am...a friend of hers.
2407974 2409684 Someone...<br />- Wait.
2412339 2415885 I know who you are!<br />Grandma told me, you would come.
2416303 2419265 You're the woman from the bank.<br />The one who took her out
2419548 2423093 Actually it was the bank that took the house.<br />I..I mean, I just work there.
2423553 2427140 Infact, I tried to help your grandma<br />get the house back.
2426997 2428540 But my boss wouldn't let me.
2428718 2432472 Are you gonna stand here on my porch<br />and lie to my face?
2437449 2438450 No.
2439091 2441885 You used to be a real fat girl,<br />didn't you?
2447781 2450200 Ya<br />- I can tell.
2451425 2453010 You're not welcome here.
2453828 2458416 Wait...I need to see her,<br />I need her to forgive me.
2458633 2460218 And I'll get her the house back.
2460195 2462614 And you gonna make everything alright<br />for her, is that it?
2462558 2463559 Yes.
2465361 2466654 Come on.
2480659 2481910 Where is she?
2532160 2535538 Get off me!<br />Get off me!
2550862 2553865 Still gonna make everything alright<br />for her?
2555227 2557938 You deserve everything that's coming to!
2566279 2569241 I beleive what plagues you is Lamia
2569163 2571499 Lamia, that's the word the old woman used.
2571446 2572572 "The Black Goat"
2572487 2575740 Only summoned by the Gypsies<br />for their darkest deeds.
2575851 2577978 For the first 3 Days, the Lamia appears as a...
2577933 2580478 ..nasty spirit that torments it's victim.
2580937 2584106 After that it reveals itself to be a<br />taker of souls.
2584020 2586439 And comes for the owner of<br />the cursed object.
2586424 2588092 Cursed object?<br />What object?
2588025 2591278 Something taken from the victim,<br />cursed and given back.
2595194 2596445 This?
2598317 2599693 What if I just burn it?
2599679 2603349 Am afraid, no matter what condition<br />the button is in,
2603243 2604828 You would still be the owner.
2604805 2607808 Alamia would still come to take you<br />- Take me where?
2614457 2616292 Then how do I get rid of this?
2616258 2618511 You could attempt to appease the spirit
2618741 2620660 The simplest way would be a blood offering.
2620823 2624368 A small creature could be sacrified.<br />Ah..a chicken perhaps...
2624268 2625436 No way!
2625429 2626972 Look, I'm a vegetarian.
2626951 2629161 I volunteered..<br />it's a puppy shelter for Christ's sake!
2629233 2631360 I'm not going around killing animals!
2631316 2633443 You will be surprised,<br />what you'll be willing to do...
2633399 2635109 ..when Lamia comes for you.
2638004 2639589 This will show you, how.
2655104 2656105 Hi!
2871282 2873284 Here, Kitty, Kitty.
2893827 2895621 Here, Kitty, Kitty.
2906883 2908593 Chris.<br />Chris?
2909606 2910733 Chris?
2913050 2915803 Hey, there you are!<br />What you doing out here?
2915853 2917229 Baby, I called the bank and they said<br />you left early...
2917215 2918633 And your not answering my calls!
2919177 2920762 Is that blood?
2923342 2926304 No!<br />Why would there be blood?
2926225 2929187 Baby, there's blood on your sleeve.
2929149 2933070 Oh, no...it was just tomato juice.
2932953 2936957 I was cutting tomato in the kitchen and<br />it must have gotten on my sleeve.
2939521 2944192 Hey Chris, Why don't we do<br />this dinner another time?
2944206 2946876 You had a rough couple of days,<br />I feel it's better.
2946810 2950522 No, I..I want to go to the dinner.<br />- I know, but...
2950494 2952371 You sure, you feeling alright?
2953697 2956742 Honestly..I haven't been.
2962188 2966692 But I think...I think everything's<br />gonna be ok now.
2968835 2970503 I really do.
2975163 2976373 What do you think?
2979928 2981430 You look beautiful.
2985054 2987390 Gosh, it's such a nice day.<br />- Ya, it really is.
2987497 2989541 Would be nice inside too.
2992743 2993994 They gonna love you.
2997189 2999399 Clay! Hi, mother!<br />Good to see you.
2999311 3001105 This is Christine<br />this is my mom, Trudy.
3001073 3004869 Hello, Christine. - Hello.<br />It's very nice to meet you.
3005598 3007684 Please, come in.<br />Come in.
3008402 3010946 Hey, Dad! - Hey, son!<br />How are you? Good to see you.
3011045 3013923 This is Christine<br />Christine, this is my dad, Leonard.
3014529 3017240 You have a beautiful home<br />- Oh, thank you very much.
3018614 3020407 Can I get you a drink?<br />- Wine?
3020736 3021612 Sure.
3021937 3024857 Come down.<br />I'll be right back.
3025141 3027352 I'll take a Chardonnay.<br />- Yes, dear.
3028705 3031458 I hope you do not mind.<br />- Oh, how thoughtful.
3031389 3032974 Home-made?<br />- Yes.
3033391 3040106 What type of cake you would call that?<br />- It's called...a Harvest cake.
3040239 3045036 Something...you make in a farm?<br />- No...
3047688 3050399 I mean not anymore,<br />we used to...
3050371 3054167 When we had a gaggle of geese.<br />Geese?
3054095 3055805 Well, right around the harvest time,
3055777 3059322 Thats when the goose eggs will<br />make a real dense yolk..
3059221 3060848 Makes for a rich cake.
3063106 3065358 Well, just...thank you.
3066029 3068031 Hey, here we are..<br />Sorry..
3068352 3069937 Why don't you join us<br />in the dining room?
3069914 3071541 - Yeah, let's go.<br />Ok.
3073559 3075686 Oh, Jesus!<br />Hecuba?
3076121 3078999 Never did understand that damned animal.<br />Hate cats.
3078885 3082263 That is so strange!<br />Hecuba is usually very sweet.
3082408 3084827 Oh, that's okay.<br />I had a cat, I understand.
3086373 3087958 We have a cat.
3089697 3093492 What you mean? It's not like<br />something's happened to him.
3095224 3097351 How am I supposed to now?
3097786 3100289 You know how cats are.<br />They come and they go.
3104114 3105365 That's true.
3107398 3110777 Well, let's...<br />- Yes, yes, please.
3111082 3112959 So how's the coin collection, son?
3113085 3115754 It's my dad's favorite topic.<br />I see, he's still a...
3116128 3117254 Huh!<br />It's good, it's good.
3117249 3120711 Infact, Christine just got me a 1929<br />Standing Liberty quarter at a bank.
3120654 3121571 Really?<br />- Isn't that crazy?
3121574 3122533 That's rare.
3122656 3125826 Oh, I just think that job of bank teller<br />must be so difficult?
3125779 3129324 With all counting and repetition,<br />you must get very tedious.
3129223 3132184 Yes, you're right.<br />But I'm not a teller.
3132107 3134943 Oh? - Yeah mom, I thought<br />I told you, Christine's a loan officier.
3134910 3138121 Handles other loans for small businesses<br />and homes for banks...
3137993 3141330 And she's expecting promotion, so...<br />Right, Chris ?
3141437 3144565 If I can close this one account,<br />I'm working on. It would really help.
3144561 3146438 That must be a very important loan
3146403 3148697 - It's the biggest my branch<br />has ever handled!
3149047 3150632 And how did that come to you?
3152010 3154221 Well, I was reading the<br />Wall Street journal...
3154173 3157718 And came cross this medical supply company<br />that was looking to expand...
3157616 3159201 ..but didn't have the liquidity.
3159339 3162175 So, I met up with their CFO and<br />presented a formula...
3162141 3164644 ..for re-structuring some of their<br />long-term acts.
3165025 3167278 Sounds-like you got luck's going<br />for you, Christine.
3167348 3169558 Well, your mother must be<br />very proud of you.
3170832 3172000 - I suppose.
3177720 3180389 I don't see much of my mother.<br />- Why is that?
3180443 3183238 Well, it's..it's...her personal..
3183166 3184584 I'm speaking to Christine.
3188533 3193246 Well, ever since my dad died,<br />she doesn't talk much...
3193499 3199922 She just stays in the farm and<br />keeps to herself.
3199706 3201708 Because...<br />Because?
3202349 3205936 Because...her husband died, mom,<br />she wants to be by herself.
3205913 3208457 Why don't...<br />- Because my mother is an alcoholic.
3212400 3214111 I'm sorry.
3215564 3218693 It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.
3219249 3221918 I have to say, I find your honesty<br />very refreshing.
3222853 3226315 My father had a drinking problem.<br />I was always too ashamed to admit it.
3227098 3228725 You got backbone.
3229381 3232217 Not like that last girl you brought by.<br />What was her name?
3232905 3233864 - Alice.<br />We don't have to..
3233866 3234825 - Alicia.
3234827 3236496 - Alicia.<br />She was dreadful, Christine.
3236629 3239590 She was ill-mannered, no amibition at all.
3240274 3242150 Well, they met on the internet.<br />- What is that?
3242116 3244285 "They met on the internet", really?<br />What does that mean?
3244238 3247074 May I beat it out of him?<br />- No, not at all.
3247002 3247961 - Thank you very much.
3247963 3253009 You know, I think, I would try some of<br />that cake of yours.
3254450 3258996 You only..you only just like it, if you hate<br />delicious things.
3269748 3271375 Harvest cake, huh?<br />- That's right.
3271790 3273458 Must get this recipe.<br />- Not so sweet, isn't?
3273753 3275296 Did you hear something?
3275956 3278208 - No.<br />You, ok?
3279439 3281483 I like that a lot.<br />- I do like that.
3282283 3285661 And mom, you sure I met her<br />on the Internet?
3285567 3287068 It was bit misleading...
3305230 3306898 You have to find her a mate.
3307232 3309609 You can't even trust things that<br />you hear or...
3309555 3311348 ..people that write about themselves.<br />- Very nice!
3311276 3313779 And pictures are false half the time.<br />Is that true?
3313720 3316014 Ya, it's true..<br />- I don't think it's a misconception..
3315922 3318216 ..to think that people of good breeding<br />and success
3318284 3323748 ..should be able to make potential...<br />in realistic situations, isn't it?
3332502 3334129 Would you, Christine?
3336426 3339012 No, no !<br />Ofcourse, no.
3339270 3343023 But, but..we did, remember the bar, Chris?<br />What you talking about.
3343234 3345361 Oh my God, that's right.<br />- Shit.
3345317 3346610 ...is straight.
3346638 3349891 It's not a...., mom.<br />It's a bar.
3350803 3352805 Yeah, we heard that!<br />- So, met at the bar.
3352966 3354926 We set-up the date on the internet.
3355889 3356973 You, ok?
3358172 3359340 Ok?
3360054 3361180 Here, have some...
3361335 3362795 ....on the wrong plate.
3364379 3365672 Oh, my God!
3376634 3378260 Sorry, I didn't..<br />I din't...
3386245 3388372 Okay, I hear you!
3388367 3391745 Leave me alone,<br />just leave the hell alone!
3391651 3393403 Please, there's no one there.
3399540 3402751 I think I better go.<br />- Yes, I think that would be best.
3404385 3407514 Hey, Chris!<br />- Don't follow her, she's a sick girl.
3407469 3410097 No, she needs my help.<br />- Let her go.
3411674 3412884 Wait!
3413837 3415255 What's the matter?
3416440 3420610 Look, I did what you said!<br />I killed that little kitty.
3420645 3422397 You're so full of shit!
3422366 3424911 These are illusive and powerful forces,<br />we are dealing with.
3424849 3426559 There are no guarantees!
3444152 3447238 You speak directly to the black spirit.
3447316 3449735 You must dissuade it from taking<br />your soul.
3449879 3453132 And soon.<br />I know someone who could help us.
3453243 3455161 And I'm supposed to trust you?
3455365 3459536 Tomorrow is the third day.<br />After that Lamia will come after you.
3459530 3460906 We can't let that happen!
3461933 3465020 But you must understand...<br />the woman who can help us,
3465097 3467558 ..must herself at great risk.
3467500 3469168 She will not do that for free.
3469462 3471046 What you need from me?
3471144 3473689 $10,000...cash.
3474388 3475847 By tomorrow.
3489125 3491544 Mr. Jacks?<br />Ya.
3491568 3493278 This is kinda awkward of me
3493250 3495252 And I know it's not officially apt.
3496494 3499997 But I was wondering if I could get an<br />advance for the new position.
3499857 3502109 - What the..the Asst. Manager's position?
3502460 3506131 - Yes. See one of my family members<br />is really sick.
3506666 3509627 They're not gonna die..but they could..<br />- Christine..Christine!
3510029 3511239 There is a problem.
3511191 3514152 The McPherson deal was cancelled<br />last night.
3514235 3515945 - What?<br />Ya.
3516397 3519900 Right after I informed the Regional Office that<br />we had this big loan handing..
3519841 3522844 I find out, they just made the deal over,<br />with First National!
3523325 3526120 I gotten into a call to see what<br />excatly happened..but...
3526169 3530131 Right now, this does not look too good<br />for you or for me.
3530694 3535824 So this Asst. Manager's promotion<br />has been delayed.
3535819 3538655 Infact you know, I think with everything<br />that's been happening,
3538583 3541753 I think, I'm gonna have to give<br />this job to Stu.
3542667 3545128 Stu...?<br />I see.
3545351 3547979 I'm sorry, look,<br />if you got family problems...
3547874 3550918 may be you should take the day off,<br />sort them out and...
3616034 3617494 So, how much?
3617555 3621309 $3800 for everything.<br />- Including my jewellery?
3621280 3622448 - Including!
3622442 3624569 But this stuff is worth so much<br />more than that!
3625045 3629215 Please?<br />This is all I have, I'm begging you.
3630010 3631804 Take it or leave it!
3640703 3643080 Chris?<br />Chris...?
3645548 3646758 Baby?
3665331 3667625 I thought, you relax for sometime, alright?
3668816 3673946 I'm...thought I screwed it,<br />I'm eating ice cream.
3677306 3679308 I paid Rham Jas.
3682552 3686347 - What?<br />You kidding me?
3686437 3687729 I paid him.
3688238 3691200 - Why? I mean,<br />I thought that you didn't beleive.
3691962 3694632 I..I don't know<br />what I beleive in anymore.
3694846 3699309 I really don't...but..<br />I know you beleive in this
3699251 3703005 I know, how important is this<br />to you and...
3702896 3705065 ..I know how much pain this is<br />causing you.
3706139 3709517 And, uhh...and also remembered,
3710384 3715723 I remember a promise that I made,<br />That I fell in love with you.
3716311 3718480 I told myself that..I would...
3719195 3723449 I would always look out for you<br />and always would take care of you.
3724360 3726112 So, I paid him.
3729286 3732331 You remember the night,<br />you fell in love with me?
3732250 3734502 I rememeber, every second of that.
3736615 3738325 Oh, my God.
3750511 3752763 You sure, you don't want me to<br />go in with you?
3752754 3754255 - He said, I should come alone.
3754236 3757155 - Yeah, I know-I know,<br />he told me the same thing.
3792281 3795242 Christine, if you would be,<br />the pleasure with introduction,
3795244 3796537 Shaun San Dena!
3800410 3802954 Welcome!<br />- How do you do?
3803694 3805821 Shaun San Dena's a experienced medium
3805776 3808779 By the more, she's personally even<br />touched the Lamia!
3809100 3812270 I first encountered this spirit,<br />many years ago...
3812464 3813882 ..in this very house.
3814306 3817017 And..what happened?
3817991 3821703 - I lost a young boy's soul...
3821915 3823208 ..to the beast!
3828002 3832214 I have waited, these long years,
3832528 3836323 ..for a chance at redeeming myself.
3836572 3840368 A chance to destory the foul thing.<br />And...
3840256 3842842 It's time to go,<br />Please?
3847065 3850735 Tonight,<br />my chance will come!
3851229 3855317 But to summon it,<br />I will need your help.
3856115 3858325 Can you be strong?
3860561 3861854 - I will try.
3866647 3869942 My late hushand, Sandok,<br />was also a medium.
3869971 3873224 He choose this site to build the house<br />upon because..
3873175 3876136 ..he felt, certain forces of the<br />world are here.
3876900 3882780 At this place, there is a particular..<br />confluence...
3888793 3891087 A particular confluence of forces which...
3891036 3894414 ..allows a doorway to be opened through<br />which we may pass.
3898244 3901205 And through which,<br />others may pass into our world.
3906614 3908741 Please, be seated.
3935848 3937016 What's going on?
3937010 3939971 - Everything we doing is for your own good.<br />Please...
3940735 3943070 Christine..<br />please.
3947221 3948640 Thank you.
3967126 3972339 Holy Spirit...<br />Bless us!
3977898 3981819 Once the spirit has entered me,<br />put my hand upon the animal.
3982183 3985394 Do you understand?<br />- Yes.
3985306 3988393 I'll force the spirit of Lamia,<br />into the goat.
3988750 3992170 Milos, that's when you strike.<br />- Yes, I'll do that.
3992115 3994117 You strike it hard!
3994076 3995661 I understand.
4006051 4008053 We all must be receptive!
4022270 4023730 What am I supposed to do?
4023792 4026086 You must allow the darkness in!
4026155 4029241 You must invite the dead,<br />to come into your spirit!
4030039 4033209 I'm scared!<br />- Yes.
4033163 4034748 Now, repeat these words.
4035165 4037876 I welcome the dead...<br />into my soul!
4041372 4045000 I welcome the dead into my soul!<br />- You must beleive it!
4045617 4048578 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4049822 4053534 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4053546 4056883 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4056950 4060120 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4060034 4063329 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4063238 4066491 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4066402 4070406 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4071568 4074404 We're waiting holy spirits,<br />are you with us?
4074331 4077501 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4077414 4079375 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4079336 4080921 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4080858 4082026 I welcome the dead into my..
4085664 4088542 Something else is here with us.
4089028 4090821 Yes.
4117862 4121365 It is not Lamia!<br />It is...
4121867 4125454 The spirit of someone..<br />Lost it's soul...
4125470 4127097 ..from years ago.
4127393 4130688 Sometimes they settle once<br />and linger by the door!
4131198 4134368 There are others here, as well.
4144093 4147888 Speak out, spirit!<br />Speak out!
4159911 4162038 He is coming!
4260590 4263759 He now inhibits the body of<br />Shaun San Dena!
4267117 4272706 Lamia-a-a-a-a!
4276088 4278090 Lamia, what is it,<br />you desire?
4278049 4282429 I desire, the soul of Christine Brown!
4282535 4285871 We will feast upon it,<br />while she festers in the grave!
4286179 4289266 No, it was my manager Jim Jacks,<br />He was the one...
4289182 4290350 Silence!
4290544 4294757 Lamia, sure you can be dissuaded from taking<br />this insignificant woman.
4294709 4297503 Sure, she is not worthy of her greatness!
4305962 4307672 No!
4311328 4315415 I come for you, Christine.
4316615 4318199 You are mine!
4322982 4328363 No...you tricked me,<br />you black-hearted who-o-o-o-ore!
4328228 4329521 Now, Milos...now!
4329510 4330469 You bitch-h-h!
4343366 4345284 Away, I say, evil spirit!
4360787 4361955 Lamia!
4362268 4363895 I was the one who summoned you,<br />into this circle.
4364070 4366072 I command you to leave,<br />this instance!
4368996 4371499 She has great chest!
4373121 4375248 Christine-e-e-e!
4380489 4385411 I don't want your cat,<br />you dirty, little whore queen!
4395988 4400367 Shaun San Dena!<br />You must banish the spirit!
4400553 4401638 Yes.
4432310 4433436 Milos?
4434312 4435605 Oh, my God!
4436075 4438118 I'm ok.<br />- My God.
4438117 4440286 I'm ok.<br />- Oh, my God.
4442722 4445100 You did it.<br />- Thank, God.
4446567 4449487 I tried...<br />- Are you ok?
4449651 4451861 Oh, my God!<br />Help me!
4456218 4457803 Call the ambulance.
4461585 4463128 Is she breathing?
4464668 4465836 - No!
4469034 4470452 Oh, God.
4510202 4513247 It's so sad.<br />- Yes.
4513165 4515126 It's strange, how things work out.
4515288 4519709 She waited 40 years for another chance,<br />to overcome the Lamia.
4521094 4526475 And finally, on the last night of her life,<br />she did!
4526340 4528634 No, I'm afraid you misunderstand!
4529784 4532579 Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.
4532708 4535544 This is our lesson, tonight!<br />I'm sorry.
4535752 4537462 But I saw her get rid of that thing.
4537434 4541855 - No, you saw her drive it from the seance.<br />That is all.
4541718 4544680 He will be back.<br />The goat was never slaughtered.
4545603 4548272 This night is through...
4548246 4552083 Lamia will come for the owner of<br />the cursed object.
4555014 4557726 Unless, ofcourse,<br />if you're no longer the owner.
4557738 4558947 Here, the button.
4567429 4571725 Give a gift to, then<br />you have given the curse away.
4574597 4576390 Why didn't you tell me this before?
4576359 4579863 Because Lamia will tear the soul of<br />whoever you give that to.
4579883 4581885 They'll burn in hell for eternity.
4583768 4589732 And I would have send them there!<br />- I, your accomplice!
4590656 4595536 Whatever you decide,<br />left a warning.
4614924 4616509 Is it over?
4617488 4619072 - It's over.
4627780 4630240 You'll burn in hell!
4630342 4635055 You'll burn in hell!<br />- You bitch, you will burn in hell!
4635068 4636903 Your time's coming!
4637351 4638811 You'll burn in hell!
4638752 4640378 You ok?
4640714 4642591 Oh, shit!
4656372 4658166 You sure, yourself ok with the<br />San Barbara trip? - Ya.
4658135 4658885 Ya?<br />- I'm fine.
4658936 4660521 And what..what time should I get you?
4660497 4662750 - It's better, if I meet you at the station.
4662820 4664822 There's something, I got to do on the way.
4664783 4666368 - I can do it, lemme do it on the way...
4666424 4668968 - No, no, I got it under control.
4669468 4672262 Meet you up at 07.30...<br />Wait, where's my envelope?
4672191 4674610 What envelope?<br />- It was in my purse, I just had it.
4675034 4677203 It's just an envelope!<br />- No, it's gotta be here!
4677157 4679159 If it's here, we will find it eventually.
4680201 4683037 Oh, my God,<br />I thought I lose it!
4683324 4684200 Ok!
4685206 4687125 07.30, don't be late!
4722970 4725014 Are you sure,<br />you don't want anything else?
4725173 4726091 - No.
4726095 4728889 - So you're just gonna sit here,<br />drinking coffee on your own?
4729098 4732476 - Yes.<br />May be..what is it to you?
4732382 4736261 Honey, I'm earning my money on tips.<br />Coffee drinkers don't tip!
4736226 4740397 Honey, just keep the coffee coming and<br />I'll give you a tip, you won't forget.
4780518 4783021 Oh, my gosh,<br />that smells good.
4784723 4787225 Your the sweetest person in the world.
4790210 4792921 Never mind, what's it about, Stu.<br />Just get here in 10 mins or...
4792813 4795440 I gonna tell Mr. Jacks something,<br />you don't me to tell him.
4796217 4798886 - Oh, yeah?<br />About what?
4798820 4802198 Well, for starters, that you stole the McPherson<br />loan file off my desk...
4802103 4804105 ..and gave it to First National!
4804226 4805394 Now, you got 9 minutes!
4809792 4812753 Give me another.<br />- Seriously?
4820405 4823116 Oh God, Christine,<br />please don't betray me.
4823168 4826296 I mean, if my dad finds out...<br />Just tell me what you want?
4826212 4829507 I need to give something to you.<br />A little gift!
4829496 4830789 A gift...?
4832699 4833992 I don't understand!<br />I thought you called me down here...
4833981 4835608 because I gave that loan to<br />First National...
4835623 4838126 Look, you don't need to understand!<br />Just shut up!
4840508 4842219 Now, this gift that I'm giving you...
4842190 4844776 ..will become your property,<br />you will be the owner, alight?
4847877 4849295 - Ok.
4854325 4855576 Ok.
4859010 4860344 What?
4861333 4862084 Forget it.
4864216 4865884 I thought, you wanted to give it to me<br />because of the loan stuff...
4865858 4867526 Just leave!
4869983 4873611 Ok!<br />Thank you so much, Christine.
4878954 4881122 But your not gonna tell my dad, right?
4881036 4882037 Go!<br />- Ok.
4892610 4894904 Who does...this?
4903582 4906252 GANUSH SYLVIA
4914796 4917048 Well, is it possible?
4917919 4920713 There are gypsy blessings,<br />which also works with dead.
4920842 4925097 They give gifts to their departed,<br />very favourite to the deceased soul.
4925048 4927342 But truelly, the soul never dies.
4929173 4932426 Yes, I do beleive you could give<br />the curse...
4932336 4933587 ..to someone who has passed on.
4933898 4936443 But you must give a formal gift,<br />to the cursed object,
4936381 4937424 ..to the deceased.
4936862 4941825 - Oh, I'll do better than that!<br />I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!
4941667 4943252 How many gifts...
5011749 5013042 GANUSH
5045629 5047339 I'm giving it back to you!
5049513 5051432 You gonna take this thing!
5053038 5054956 Are you gonna take this thing?
5057923 5059091 Take it!
5071740 5074159 That's the last of my hair,<br />you're cutting!
5079509 5084973 I, Christine Brown, do hereby,<br />make a formal gift...
5084795 5087923 ..this button, to you, Sylvia Ganush.
5089400 5091402 Choke on it, bitch!
5105499 5107376 Goodbye!
5193242 5196203 Hi, it's Christine, leave a message and<br />I'll call you back.
5196646 5198356 Christine, it's Jim.<br />Jim Jacks.
5198808 5200393 I'm sorry, I'm calling so early...
5200370 5202497 But last night, I found out some<br />troubling information...
5202453 5205247 ..about our friend Stu Rubin.
5205176 5208513 Apparently, he stole your file on<br />the McPherson loan...
5208419 5211756 ..and then tried to broke his own deal<br />with First National.
5211743 5213662 I guess,<br />he thought he wouldn't find out.
5213666 5215376 And we wouldn't have either, except that,
5215348 5220061 An hour ago he came by my house and<br />tried to pin the whole thing on you!
5220514 5224560 After I confronted him about<br />a few inconsistencies in the story...
5224439 5229068 ..he broke down crying, well,<br />we won't be seeing him around anymore.
5229765 5231475 So, I just wanted you to know that,
5231447 5232906 Come, monday morning,
5232888 5236600 ..that Asst. Manager's postion will be<br />waiting for you.
5275779 5276488 Hi!
5276500 5277709 Good morning.
5277781 5281201 I'm sorry. But...<br />- I just...I just want this coat.
5281105 5282398 We are not open yet!
5282346 5284348 My boyfriend and I are taking<br />this really...
5284309 5286019 ..special trip this morning.
5287473 5288349 Please.
5297244 5298119 Hi!
5298925 5300510 Hey, oh!<br />Wo-o-w!
5301048 5302549 Oh God,<br />so glad you are here!
5302530 5303364 So many things I wanna to tell.
5303371 5304539 You wanna listen to something,<br />I have to say?
5304532 5305951 Although I have it straight in my head?
5305934 5307811 - Ok, go right ahead.
5307776 5310070 You never stopped looking out for me.
5310660 5312370 Thank you for that.
