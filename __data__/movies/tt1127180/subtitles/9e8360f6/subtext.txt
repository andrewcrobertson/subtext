385766 387267 I think we can make this work.
387268 389394 I'll call you this<br />afternoon and let you know.
389395 390478 - Thank you so much.<br />- Thank you.
390479 392939 - You're welcome.<br />- Thank you.

409957 411332 Here you go, Mr. Jacks.
411333 413294 <font color="#cf685c">MR. JACKS: Thank you.
415296 416296 Mr. Jacks?
417798 420258 I was wondering if you'd<br />made any decision regarding
420259 422302 the assistant manager's position.
422303 424012 Oh, well, I'm still deciding,
424013 426806 and right now, it's<br />between Stu and yourself.
426807 428099 Stu Rubin, the new guy?
428100 428933 Well, I know he's new,
428934 431978 but he's also quite<br />aggressive, and we like that.
431979 433438 You know, Stu's someone who's not afraid
433439 436649 to crunch the numbers and<br />make the tough decisions.
436650 439277 I'm perfectly capable of<br />making the tough decisions.
439278 441696 I'll let you know as soon as I decide.
441697 442697 Okay?
443532 444699 In the meantime, take him through
444700 449203 our loan qualifying procedures,<br />just in case, all right?
449204 450204 Okay.
451623 453374 <font color="#cf685c">MR. JACKS: Oh, and would you mind taking
453375 454917 your lunch break now?
454918 455918 Sure.
455919 456961 And maybe on your way back,
456962 459130 you could pick me up a turkey club?
459131 461466 Turkey club, excellent choice.
461467 462550 You mind picking one up for me?
462551 463551 Thanks.
464553 466013 And spicy mustard.
467473 468639 - What have you got?<br />- Get your approval on this?
468640 470016 This is the loan we talked
470017 470850 about before.<br />- Oh, the loan.
470851 471851 Exactly.
472770 473811 Big one, huh?
473812 474645 <font color="#cf685c">MR. JACKS: 1.5.
474646 478025 Absolutely, it'll be one of many.
480027 480985 Well, Professor,
480986 483488 congratulations on making<br />it through your first week.
483489 485531 Thank you very much.
485532 486783 Mm.
486784 488951 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: Thought you'd have a full beard by now.
488952 489994 So did I.
489995 491537 I'm a little disappointed.
491538 492705 Oh, man, this thing.
493540 494374 That's it.<br />I'm done.
494375 495375 I'm out.
496085 498836 Chris, don't even bother.
498837 500296 I gotta get a new one.
500297 501631 I'm telling you, you're<br />gonna drive yourself nuts.
501632 505761 It's completely broken.
508472 509806 Was broken.
509807 513268 You are cocky and sexy and unbelievable.
515062 517188 I almost forgot.
517189 519190 Found it at the bank.
519191 520401 What is this?
522152 523361 No way!
523362 525446 Wow, it's a 1929 Standing Liberty,
525447 527490 and it's almost fully struck.
527491 529367 You found this in regular<br />circulation at the bank?
529368 530410 I did.
530411 534539 I'm gonna add this to<br />my nerdy coin collection.
534540 535832 - Okay.<br />- Thank you, baby.
535833 538251 Thanks for thinking of me.
539211 540044 All right.
540045 541003 - Bye.<br />- Bye.
541004 544550 - See you later.<br />- I'll see you later, okay?
545551 546384 Dr. Dalton.
546385 548636 - Hello, dear.<br />- Oh, hi, Mom.
548637 550012 What are you doing?
550013 551597 Christine just came over,<br />brought some lunch, and
551598 552807 I'm correcting some papers.<br />- Christine?
552808 554142 Oh, the one from the farm?
554143 555810 Yeah, Mom, the girl I've been dating
555811 558688 for almost a year,<br />the girl who's coming for dinner.
558689 559647 We're still on for dinner?<br />- I'm sure she's
559648 560565 a very sweet girl.
560566 561399 She is.
561400 562483 I can't wait for you to--<br />- But, you know, your father
562484 564777 and I just have certain<br />expectations for you.
564778 565611 I can't really do
565612 566737 the expectations.<br />- I understand Amy Kulick is
566738 568489 looking for someone to play tennis with.
568490 569824 - Yeah, I.<br />- You know, she graduated
569825 571534 from Yale Law with honors,
571535 573786 and she's a very successful attorney now.
573787 575288 I know.<br />You told me.
575289 576539 Yeah, that's the kind of girl
576540 578416 I would love to see you with.
578417 579709 - Mother--<br />- She's the kind of woman
579710 582628 who could really help you socially
582629 584547 and, as a result, in your career.
584548 585423 And that's the kind of thing
585424 586716 you should be thinking about now.
586717 587758 Mother, I don't wanna--
587759 589093 You can't be playing around
589094 590720 with little girls off the farm.
590721 591554 I think you're really gonna like--
591555 595350 It's time to really find a partner.
598479 602356 Mm, Christine, you messed up my order.
602357 603983 No, I didn't.
603984 605861 Yeah, I said no mayo.
607821 609615 You never said that.
612284 613117 Know what?<br />Don't sweat it.
613118 614118 It's okay.
630052 632762 Mr. Jacks, by the way,<br />aren't you a Laker fan?
632763 633804 <font color="#cf685c">MR. JACKS: I am a Laker fan.
633805 635348 My mom is having this thing on Sunday.
635349 636307 I can't use these.
636308 637475 - Are you serious?<br />- Yeah.
637476 638726 Absolutely, you want them?<br />- These are great seats!
638727 639602 They are great seats.
639603 640436 <font color="#cf685c">MR. JACKS: This is where they bring
640437 641604 the hot dogs right to you.<br />- Yes, it is.
641605 643064 You are gonna hobnob with celebs.
643065 644023 <font color="#cf685c">MR. JACKS: You sure that's okay?
644024 645149 Absolutely, it's okay.
645150 646150 Yeah.<br />- Well, thank you, Stu.
646151 647735 Take them. Absolutely.
647736 650614 Say hey to Kobe for me.<br />- Of course.
654284 655827 Will you help me?
656745 657578 Of course.
657579 658621 What can I do for you?
658622 660915 Your trucks are at my house.
660916 665253 The men are packing all<br />my things, private things.
665254 667630 Please, make them stop.
673387 674303 Mrs.--
674304 675304 Ganush.
676682 680059 Mrs. Ganush, the bank is<br />informing you of their intent
680060 683771 to repossess your property<br />at 325 Brandon Street today.
683772 686650 But this is my home for 30 years.
687776 691905 And I make every payment until<br />the sickness took my eye.
692906 694574 I hope to have more money soon.
694575 697243 I just need a little more time.
697244 698494 You--<br />- I don't think my manager's
698495 701289 going to extend you any more credit.
701290 702331 Oh.
702332 704792 Please.
704793 705919 Won't you try?
710924 712425 Okay.
712426 713426 Bless you.
715012 716012 Bless you!
722102 724186 We have an elderly woman<br />asking for an extension
724187 726272 on her mortgage payment.
726273 727273 She's on a fixed income,
727274 729859 and she's had some medical problems.
729860 733905 There's gotta be something<br />we can do to help her.
739536 741329 Well, apparently, we've already granted
741330 743080 her two extensions.
743081 744790 And, you know, on this<br />type of foreclosure,
744791 746959 we seize the trapped equity
746960 749587 and the bank makes a<br />sizable amount in fees.
749588 751839 We would have to throw<br />her out of her house.
751840 753800 It's a tough decision.
754968 755968 Your call.
781620 783497 I'll take care of it.
803558 805142 Mrs. Ganush.
805143 806477 I'm sorry, Mrs. Ganush,
806478 809313 but another extension on the<br />loan is out of the question.
809314 810231 What?
810232 812024 I would like to help,<br />but it is in the bank's--
812025 815277 No, please, this is my home.
815278 816738 Where will I live?
817781 819448 You list your<br />granddaughter as a reference.
819449 820574 Maybe you could stay with her.
820575 822619 I would not burden her.
823620 826163 And there are several fine<br />assisted living facilities
826164 828290 for the elderly.<br />- A nursing home?
828291 832087 No, I would never live<br />in one of those places.
833338 834881 I'm really sorry.
859781 862992 I am proud woman, Miss Brown,
862993 866037 and never have I begged for anything.
868123 870000 But now, I beg for you.
871752 873878 I humble myself before you.<br />- Mrs. Ganush, Mrs. Ganush,
873879 876839 please, please stand up.<br />- I, Sylvia Ganush, beg.
876840 879468 On my mother's grave, I beg you!
880385 881385 Please let go.
881386 882344 Let go!
882345 883429 Security!
883430 884430 Stop!
886391 887224 Over here, Billy!
887225 889685 Over here!<br />- We're coming.
897569 898779 You shame me.
909581 911875 I beg you, and you shame me.
914669 917546 I think your business<br />is finished here, ma'am.
917547 918547 Let's go.
925263 926305 Mrs. Ganush.
938568 939693 Go, ma'am.
939694 941238 Let's go.
945992 949411 I never saw anything<br />quite like that before.
949412 950455 Are you okay?
952916 956044 You handled that just right, you know.
966221 967054 Good night.
967055 968055 See you tomorrow.
968056 969266 Okay.
972060 975354 You know, I just finished<br />going over this McPherson loan.
975355 978023 This is very impressive work.
978024 978858 Thanks.
978859 980401 Would you mind taking this home tonight
980402 981360 and finishing it up?
981361 982653 Because I would like to show it
982654 984697 to the regional veep in the morning.
984698 985865 I would love to.
985866 987867 - Great.<br />- Thank you.
987868 992371 Oh, and as far as that<br />assistant manager's position goes,
992372 994791 you're at the top of the list.
1108530 1109823 You shamed me.
1235824 1238118 I beat you, you old bitch!
1267689 1268939 No!
1296843 1297843 Lamia.
1314402 1318031 Soon it will be you who<br />comes begging to me.
1349979 1350854 She's right over there.
1350855 1353357 Thank you, thank you.
1353358 1354358 Hey.
1359364 1361323 Once they send some officers<br />over to have a talk with her,
1361324 1362824 she's not gonna be<br />bothering you anymore, okay?
1362825 1364326 So don't even think about her.
1364327 1365911 And I'm gonna call Mr. Jacks<br />and just make sure
1365912 1368205 he can have somebody walk you<br />to your car every night, okay?
1368206 1370123 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: Okay.
1370124 1372793 Just thank God you're okay.
1372794 1374711 You are okay, right?
1374712 1375712 I'm fine.
1377340 1378757 What?
1378758 1380759 What's the matter?
1380760 1382053 It's just that
1383096 1385555 maybe I could have gotten her<br />another extension on her loan.
1385556 1386932 Chris, no, don't do that.
1386933 1387933 You said the bank granted
1387934 1390269 this woman two extensions already, right?
1390270 1391561 I'm sorry, if you don't pay your mortgage,
1391562 1392396 you lose your house.
1392397 1393730 What does this woman expect?
1393731 1395023 It's not your fault.
1395024 1396424 You can't beat yourself up over it.
1421843 1423468 What is it?
1423469 1424594 What's wrong?
1424595 1426805 Did you hear that?
1426806 1428015 What?
1428016 1429726 Really?<br />You didn't?
1431102 1432102 No.
1432103 1433103 What?
1436983 1438483 I know this is gonna sound weird,
1438484 1441320 but I wanna get my fortune read.
1442989 1444323 Now?
1444324 1445616 Are you kidding?
1446826 1447909 Come on, Chris.
1447910 1449745 I'll read your fortune for you.
1449746 1452164 Mm, in the near future, we<br />are gonna get in the car,
1452165 1452998 go home, and relax.<br />- Clay, I really want
1452999 1453999 to do this.
1455251 1458128 Why, because of what<br />happened with that old woman?
1458129 1462258 Chris, I really think we<br />should just get you home now.
1463176 1465886 Can you do this for me?
1472727 1477105 Pray to God none of<br />my students see me here.
1477106 1478607 The only class I'll be able to teach is,
1478608 1480234 like, Hypocrisy 101.
1483154 1485030 Hm, so many things to choose from here.
1485031 1486531 Unfortunately, not what I'm looking for,
1486532 1488867 which is a weird little dried monkey head.
1488868 1490619 Oh, wait, no, never mind, he's got one.
1490620 1493747 Shh.
1493748 1495541 I am Rham Jas, seer.
1496876 1499127 I'm Christine and this is Clay.
1499128 1500648 You probably already knew that, right?
1503549 1505258 Just kidding.
1505259 1506426 How can I help you?
1506427 1508804 I would like to have my fortune read.
1508805 1510180 Can you do that?
1510181 1513183 I have the ability to<br />see certain energies.
1513184 1516895 Sometimes these energies are<br />a foretoken of things to come.
1516896 1518230 $60, please.
1518231 1519356 Seriously?
1519357 1520190 Yes.
1520191 1521691 60.
1521692 1523860 Doesn't that seem a little<br />steep for this sort of thing?
1523861 1526739 If you're not serious, please go.
1527657 1528740 All right.<br />Come on, Chris.
1528741 1529699 Wait, wait.
1529700 1531368 I'll pay.<br />- Oh.
1531369 1532369 No, you know what?
1532370 1533703 All right.<br />I got it.
1533704 1534704 I got it.
1535498 1537290 There you go.
1537291 1538458 Platinum card.
1538459 1539751 Very good.
1545633 1547342 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: Thank you.
1547343 1548343 Here. Here.
1548344 1549637 - Thanks.<br />- Sure.
1552557 1554015 Ah, ah.
1554016 1555016 Please.
1557812 1560772 So, you wish to know<br />something of your destiny.
1560773 1562065 - Yes.<br />- Very good.
1562066 1563692 Let's see what the fates have in store.
1563693 1565152 You know, Freud said destiny was not
1565153 1567070 an act of fate, but<br />rather something created
1567071 1569614 by our subconscious to<br />control our conscious choices.
1569615 1570866 That's true.
1570867 1572075 But we cannot attempt to understand
1572076 1574786 the world by intellect alone.
1574787 1576329 Oh, Carl Jung.
1576330 1580042 Yes, from his treatise<br />Psychological Types.
1581002 1581835 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: So--
1581836 1584379 Jung, New Agers' favorite psychologist.
1584380 1586798 Because he wasn't afraid to<br />bring God into the equation.
1586799 1588258 Well, he wasn't afraid to bring God--
1588259 1589551 - Clay, Clay, come on.<br />- Let's do it.
1589552 1590719 I know.<br />Come on.
1590720 1591636 Let's start.
1591637 1592596 Shall we?
1592597 1593722 I'm ready.
1593723 1596475 Well, please, give me your hand.
1596476 1597476 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: Okay.
1597477 1598310 This way.
1598311 1599311 Okay.
1606027 1607653 You work with money.
1608779 1609989 That's right.
1611407 1615869 And you've recently lost something.
1615870 1617662 No, I don't think so.
1617663 1619206 No.
1619207 1622292 No, you haven't lost anything.
1622293 1625629 But something's been taken from you.
1625630 1626630 No.
1627548 1628548 A button.
1628549 1629758 Oh, my God.
1629759 1631218 Yes.
1631219 1632928 Well, anyone can see<br />she's missing a button.
1632929 1634387 So what?<br />- Clay, it was really strange.
1634388 1637015 The old woman today, she<br />took a button from my sleeve.
1637016 1638058 Why would she do that?
1638059 1641187 You would both please just be quiet.
1713467 1715343 I think that's enough for tonight.
1715344 1716720 What's wrong?
1716721 1720223 I'm tired, and I see<br />it's become quite late.
1720224 1722392 I will, of course, refund your money.
1722393 1723476 Wait, wait, wait!
1723477 1725271 Did you see something?
1726522 1728106 A dark spirit has come upon you.
1728107 1729232 What do you mean?
1729233 1730567 - Well, he's--<br />- Did you blaspheme the dead
1730568 1731818 while visiting a graveyard?
1731819 1732652 No!
1732653 1733778 Did you play with a Ouija board
1733779 1735697 or consort with those who<br />practice the black arts?
1735698 1736698 All right, take it easy, man.
1736699 1737782 Come on.<br />- Wait, Clay, Clay, Clay.
1737783 1739160 No. No, I didn't.
1740161 1742120 Perhaps someone has cursed you.
1748544 1750462 Then how did he know all that?
1750463 1753089 Know what, that you lost a button?
1753090 1754716 And by the way, he didn't<br />really know that much.
1754717 1756092 He makes a couple of good guesses,
1756093 1757385 then he stirs you up,
1757386 1759721 and then he leaves you<br />with all these questions
1759722 1762349 and, conveniently, his business card.
1763184 1765935 Come on, Chris, he's a scam artist.
1765936 1767437 But he didn't want the money.
1767438 1769147 He tried to give it back, remember?
1769148 1770774 Well, he sort of tried,
1770775 1773903 but in the end, he took it, didn't he?
1775863 1776906 I guess so.
1801430 1802889 I gotta go meet the guy<br />that's towing your car,
1802890 1803765 so you gonna be okay?
1803766 1804724 - Yeah.<br />- All right.
1804725 1806226 Kitty, take care of her.
1806227 1807060 I'll see you in about an hour.
1807061 1807936 Love you.<br />- Okay.
1807937 1808937 Okay.
2037249 2038791 Here, put that on your lip.
2038792 2039667 - Thank you.<br />- I can't believe
2039668 2040668 she came to the house.
2040669 2041628 This is so nuts.
2041629 2042670 I'm calling the cops.
2042671 2044339 It wasn't her.
2044340 2046007 Who was it then?
2046008 2047967 I don't know, I couldn't see who it was.
2047968 2049218 Of course it was her, had to be her.
2049219 2051346 No, Clay, it wasn't anyone!
2051347 2052388 It was somebody.
2052389 2053514 Chris, it had to be somebody.
2053515 2055058 The lights were out, you<br />just couldn't see who it was,
2055059 2056142 but I'm guessing it was--<br />- Clay, there wasn't
2056143 2057186 anybody here.
2059104 2060731 Then who did this?
2062691 2064652 Who hit you in the face?
2066320 2067320 Huh?
2071617 2072784 I think it's just a reaction
2072785 2074619 to her being attacked earlier in the day.
2074620 2077038 Yeah, classic symptoms<br />of post-traumatic stress.
2077039 2078039 Yeah, she's showing signs
2078040 2080583 of panic and paranoia, so.
2080584 2081793 Want me to walk you out, man?
2081794 2083044 No, no, no, no, I'm fine.
2083045 2084170 All right.
2087841 2088884 Oh, hey, hey.
2090886 2092178 How you doing?
2092179 2093471 - Better.<br />- Yeah?
2093472 2095765 Especially after the<br />doctor explained it to me.
2095766 2098101 He said that victims of violence, they--
2098102 2100478 Re-experience their trauma.
2100479 2104816 I misinterpreted it to be<br />something more than it was.
2104817 2106401 Happens.
2106402 2107945 I just, I feel...
2109488 2111489 - What?<br />- Kind of embarrassed.
2111490 2112407 Are you kidding?
2112408 2113533 No.
2113534 2117620 You never have to be embarrassed with me.
2117621 2118621 Okay?
2124169 2125962 Hey, listen, I was thinking<br />maybe we could take
2125963 2128256 a little trip on Saturday,
2128257 2130008 get on the train and go to Santa Barbara.
2130009 2131134 Your folks' cabin.
2131135 2132260 Yeah, if you're up for it, the cabin.
2132261 2133761 Oh, my God,<br />I would love to!
2133762 2134846 Yeah?<br />Oh, good.
2134847 2135680 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: That'd be so exciting.
2135681 2137473 Oh, baby, you're gonna love it.
2137474 2138891 You're gonna love it, I'm<br />excited for you to see.
2138892 2139726 There's trees
2139727 2141352 and it's private.<br />- That would be great.
2141353 2142186 It'll be great.
2142187 2143021 It'll be good.
2143022 2144022 I think we need to.
2144023 2147651 And we can just, we can<br />just talk and stuff.
2276238 2277238 What?
2278907 2281200 What's the matter?
2281201 2282911 I couldn't wake up.
2283954 2284787 It's okay.
2284788 2285913 Okay.
2285914 2287123 Come here.
2287124 2291044 Was just a dream.
2300804 2301804 Oh, baby, that's the rental car
2301805 2303723 they dropped off this morning.
2303724 2304557 Okay?<br />- Thanks.
2304558 2306225 Sure.
2306226 2307185 Love you.
2307186 2308395 Love you too.
2310105 2314234 Hey, baby, try not to piss<br />off any old ladies today, okay?
2333212 2335129 Hey, Christine?
2335130 2336380 What, are you just getting here?
2336381 2337590 What are you, the hall monitor?
2337591 2339842 Ha, ha, very funny, Christine.
2339843 2340801 Oh.
2340802 2341802 What's this?
2343013 2344805 What do you want?
2344806 2348894 I need you to finish teaching<br />me the loan procedures.
2349978 2350937 I've got a lot on my mind.
2350938 2352897 Can we do this tomorrow?
2352898 2354357 - Sure.<br />- Okay.
2354358 2355524 I'll just tell Mr. Jacks
2355525 2356525 that you don't have the time right now.
2356526 2358736 Maybe he can tell me.<br />- No, no!
2358737 2360404 Okay, I'll do it.
2360405 2361405 Okay.
2362991 2366327 We were going over the<br />asset-based lending guidelines.
2366328 2367245 Right.
2367246 2368788 Let's say your client is a company
2368789 2371457 that can't get traditional bank financing.
2382552 2383761 And?
2383762 2386723 Uh, and.
2390060 2391060 And?
2393563 2394563 And.
2397484 2401113 And get your filthy pig<br />knuckle off my desk!
2408370 2410371 Christine Blood.
2410372 2411747 Brown.
2411748 2413457 Christine.
2413458 2414458 Your nose.
2415335 2417378 Uh, sure, can you hold?
2417379 2418212 Let me help you.
2418213 2419213 No, no, I've got it under control.
2419214 2420631 Oh, my God!
2420632 2421632 Oh, my God!
2422759 2423968 Oh, God!
2423969 2424969 Oh, my God!
2424970 2426512 Stop it!
2426513 2427888 Mr. Jacks!
2427889 2428931 - Did I get any in my mouth?<br />- Mr. Jacks--
2428932 2431225 - Oh, my God!<br />- Did I get any in my mouth?
2431226 2433019 Let me take you over here to get clean.
2433020 2434979 - I'm so sorry!<br />- Why did you do that?
2434980 2436605 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: Oh, my God!
2436606 2437565 <font color="#cf685c">MR. JACKS: What was that about?
2437566 2439191 - It's just a nosebleed.<br />- Disgusting, ugh!
2439192 2440860 <font color="#cf685c">MR. JACKS: Did I get any in my mouth?
2440861 2441694 We'll clean you up.
2441695 2442695 We have antiseptic.
2442696 2444740 There's blood everywhere.
2495332 2497042 What is it?
2500837 2501670 Hi.
2501671 2502963 I came to see Sylvia Ganush.
2502964 2504465 Is she here?
2504466 2506884 Who are you?
2506885 2508762 I'm a friend of hers.
2510055 2511348 Someone--<br />- Wait.
2514935 2517061 I know who you are.
2517062 2519021 Grandma told me you would come.
2519022 2522525 You are the woman from the bank,<br />the one who took her house.
2522526 2524235 Actually, it was the<br />bank that took the house.
2524236 2526821 I mean, I just work there.
2526822 2530324 In fact, I tried to help your<br />grandma get the house back,
2530325 2531992 but my boss wouldn't let me.
2531993 2534286 Are you going to stand here on my porch
2534287 2535831 and lie to my face?
2541420 2542837 No.
2542838 2546550 You used to be a real<br />fat girl, didn't you?
2552431 2553514 Yeah.
2553515 2554558 I can tell.
2555767 2558436 You are not welcome here.
2558437 2559770 Wait!
2559771 2561355 Wait, I need to see her.
2561356 2563232 I need her to forgive me.
2563233 2564567 And I'll get her the house back.
2564568 2566652 And you're gonna make<br />everything all right for her,
2566653 2567528 is that it?
2567529 2568529 Yes.
2570282 2571282 Come on.
2586840 2588049 Where is she?
2640602 2642353 Get her off me!
2642354 2643395 Get her off me!<br />- Come!
2643396 2644396 Don't look.
2645982 2647399 Grab her shoulder.
2647400 2648901 No, no, lift her up!
2655450 2657451 Be careful.
2657452 2660079 Let's roll the dice!
2660080 2664667 Still going to make<br />everything all right for her?
2664668 2667127 You deserve everything<br />that is coming to you.
2675929 2678847 I believe what plagues you is the Lamia.
2678848 2681225 Lamia, that's the<br />word the old woman used.
2681226 2682643 The Black Goat,
2682644 2686021 only summoned by gypsies<br />for their darkest deeds.
2686022 2687147 For the first three days,
2687148 2689358 the Lamia appears as a nasty spirit
2689359 2691569 that torments its victim.
2691570 2694530 After that, it reveals itself<br />to be a taker of souls,
2694531 2697074 and it comes for the owner<br />of the accursed object.
2697075 2697908 Accursed object.
2697909 2698742 What object?
2698743 2702872 Something taken from the<br />victim, cursed and given back.
2706084 2707084 This?
2709588 2710921 What if I just burn it?
2710922 2714425 I'm afraid no matter what<br />condition the button is in,
2714426 2716260 you would still be the owner.
2716261 2718345 The Lamia would still come to take you.
2718346 2719972 Take me where?
2726521 2728105 Then how do I get rid of this?
2728106 2730941 You could attempt to appease the spirit.
2730942 2732776 The simplest way would<br />be a blood offering.
2732777 2736864 A small creature could be<br />sacrificed, a chicken perhaps.
2736865 2737698 No way!
2737699 2738991 Look, I'm a vegetarian.
2738992 2741952 I volunteer at the puppy<br />shelter, for Christ's sake.
2741953 2744163 I don't go around killing animals.
2744164 2746040 You will be surprised<br />what you'll be willing to do
2746041 2748418 when the Lamia comes for you.
2750712 2752547 This will show you how.
2768855 2769855 Hi!
2996958 2998501 Here, kitty, kitty.
3020231 3021315 Chris?
3021316 3023734 Chris?
3023735 3024735 Chris?
3026696 3028280 Hey, there you are.
3028281 3029656 What you doing out here?
3029657 3030490 Baby, I called the bank.
3030491 3031325 They said you left early.
3031326 3033452 You're not answering my calls.
3033453 3034579 Is that blood?
3037707 3038832 No.
3038833 3040375 Why would there be blood?
3040376 3043462 Yeah, baby, there's<br />blood on your sleeve.
3043463 3044463 - Oh.<br />- Are you bleeding?
3044464 3047466 No, um, it was just tomato juice.
3047467 3049801 I was cutting a tomato in the kitchen
3049802 3052847 and it must have gotten on my sleeve.
3054223 3058353 Hey, Chris, why don't we<br />do this dinner another time?
3059520 3061355 You've had a rough couple of days.
3061356 3062189 I think it's better.
3062190 3064399 No, I want to go to the dinner.
3064400 3068529 I know, but are you sure<br />you're feeling all right?
3069530 3071741 Honestly, I haven't been.
3078081 3082126 But I think that everything<br />is gonna be okay now.
3085338 3086338 I really do.
3091344 3092804 What do you think?
3096641 3098183 You look beautiful.
3101813 3103355 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: God, it's such a nice day.
3103356 3104690 It really is.
3104691 3108068 God, it's gonna be nice inside too.
3110071 3111948 They're gonna love you.
3114826 3116410 - Clayton.<br />- Hello, Mother.
3116411 3117786 Good to see you, this is Christine.
3117787 3118912 That's my mom, Trudy.
3118913 3119788 Hello, Christine.
3119789 3120664 Hello.
3120665 3122499 It's very nice to meet you.
3122500 3123458 Oh. Well.
3123459 3124459 Please, come in.
3124460 3125460 Come in.
3126337 3127295 - Hey, Dad.<br />- Hey, son.
3127296 3129506 How are you?<br />Good to see you, sir.
3129507 3131299 This is Christine, Christine,<br />this is my dad, Leonard.
3131300 3132217 - Nice to meet you.<br />- Oh, hi, Maria.
3132218 3133635 Thank you.<br />- You have a beautiful home.
3133636 3136930 Oh, well, thank you very much.
3136931 3137806 Can I get you a drink?
3137807 3138640 Yeah, wine?
3138641 3140058 Do you guys want?<br />- Sure.
3140059 3142227 Okay, come help me.
3142228 3144146 - I'll be right back.<br />- Mm-hm.
3144147 3145105 I'll take a Chardonnay!
3145106 3147649 Yes, dear.
3147650 3148608 I hope you don't mind.
3148609 3150360 Oh, how thoughtful.
3150361 3151194 Homemade?
3151195 3152154 Yes.
3152155 3155073 And what type of cake<br />would you call that?
3155074 3158286 Uh, it's called a, um, harvest cake.
3159495 3163582 Is that something you<br />would make on a farm?
3163583 3164583 No.
3166961 3168045 I mean, not anymore.
3168046 3171424 We used to when we had a gaggle of geese.
3172717 3173675 Geese?
3173676 3175343 Well, right around the harvest time,
3175344 3179139 that's when your goose eggs<br />will make a real dense yolk.
3179140 3180933 Makes for a rich cake.
3181809 3183435 Mm.
3183436 3185229 Well, just, thank you.
3186397 3187439 - Here we are.<br />- Sorry to interrupt
3187440 3188815 the bonding sesh.
3188816 3190108 Why don't you join<br />us in the dining room?
3190109 3190942 - Yeah, let's go.<br />- Yeah.
3190943 3191777 Okay.
3191778 3192861 It's right in here.
3194030 3195197 Whoa, jeez.
3195198 3196198 Hecuba.
3196949 3198784 Never did understand that damned animal.
3198785 3199701 Hate cats.
3199702 3201203 That is so strange.
3201204 3203413 Hecuba is usually very sweet.
3203414 3204581 Oh, that's okay.
3204582 3205415 I had a cat.
3205416 3206917 I understand.
3206918 3209045 You mean you have a cat.
3212090 3213410 Unless something happened to him.
3216844 3219346 Well, how am I supposed to know?
3219347 3220347 I mean, you know how cats are.
3220348 3222141 They come and they go.
3225770 3226896 That's true.
3229524 3231024 - Well.<br />- Well.
3231025 3233235 Yes. Yes, please.
3233236 3235612 So, how's the coin collection, son?
3235613 3236655 That's my dad's way of saying,
3236656 3237906 "So, you're still a huge nerd?"
3238741 3239658 It's good.<br />It's good.
3239659 3240617 In fact, Christine just got me
3240618 3242911 a 1929 Standing Liberty<br />quarter at her bank.
3242912 3243995 - Really?<br />- Isn't that crazy?
3243996 3245080 Yeah, it's rare.
3245081 3246123 Oh, I just think the job
3246124 3248416 of a bank teller must be so difficult,
3248417 3250836 with all that counting and repetition.
3250837 3252295 Must get very tedious.
3252296 3255465 Yes, you're right, but I'm not a teller.
3255466 3256466 - Oh?<br />- Yeah, Mom, I told you.
3256467 3257467 Christine's a loan officer.
3257468 3258760 - Ah.<br />- She handles all the loans
3258761 3261012 for small businesses<br />and homes for her bank.
3261013 3263682 And she's up for this big promotion, so.
3263683 3264724 Right, Chris?
3264725 3266768 If I could close this one<br />account that I'm working on,
3266769 3268103 it would really help.
3268104 3270147 Well, that must be<br />a very important loan.
3270148 3273024 It's the biggest that my<br />branch has ever handled.
3273025 3275527 And how did that come to you?
3275528 3277988 Well, I was reading<br />the Wall Street Journal
3277989 3280157 and came across this<br />medical supply company
3280158 3283660 that was looking to expand,<br />but didn't have the liquidity.
3283661 3286580 So I met with their CFO<br />and presented a formula
3286581 3289499 for restructuring some<br />of their long-term debt.
3289500 3292127 Sounds like you've got a<br />lot going for you, Christine.
3292128 3295255 Well, your mother must<br />be very proud of you.
3295256 3296256 I suppose.
3302430 3304639 Uh, I don't see much of my mother.
3304640 3305473 Why is that?
3305474 3308143 Wow, Mom, that's, it's kind of personal.
3308144 3309603 I'm speaking to Christine.
3313524 3315901 Uh, well, ever since my dad died,
3315902 3318029 um, she doesn't talk much.
3319197 3320239 She just, uh,
3321699 3325703 stays on the farm and<br />keeps to herself because...
3326954 3328288 Because?
3328289 3330415 Because her husband died, Mom,
3330416 3332167 and she just wants to be by herself.
3332168 3333001 Why don't--
3333002 3335880 Because my mother's an alcoholic.
3337048 3338048 Oh.
3339717 3340717 I'm sorry.
3342386 3345555 It's certainly nothing to be ashamed of.
3345556 3349643 Have to say, I find your<br />honesty very refreshing.
3349644 3350769 My father had a drinking problem,
3350770 3354105 and I was always too ashamed to admit it.
3354106 3355733 You've got backbone.
3356734 3358401 Unlike that last girl he brought by.
3358402 3359945 What was her name?
3359946 3360946 - Alice.<br />- We don't have to--
3360947 3361780 Alicia!
3361781 3362614 - Alicia.<br />- Oh.
3362615 3364032 She was dreadful, Christine.
3364033 3367494 She was ill-mannered, no ambition at all.
3367495 3368578 Well, they met on the internet.
3368579 3369454 There you go.<br />- Oh, what is that?
3369455 3370455 "They met on the internet"?
3370456 3371748 - Really?<br />- What does that mean?
3371749 3373083 Am I being too hard on him?
3373084 3374542 - No, not at all.<br />- There you go.
3374543 3375627 Thank you very much.<br />- Oh, thanks a lot.
3375628 3377629 You know, I think I will try<br />some of that cake of yours.
3377630 3378630 - Toss me under the bus.<br />- Look at that.
3378631 3380111 It looks great, you're gonna like it.
3381092 3382759 Looks so interesting.
3382760 3386889 You only dislike it if<br />you hate delicious things.
3398567 3400026 Harvest cake, huh?
3400027 3401278 We have to get this recipe.<br />- It sounds so quaint,
3401279 3402696 doesn't it?
3402697 3405031 Did you hear something?
3405032 3406032 No.
3406033 3407367 You okay?
3407368 3408576 Tasty.
3408577 3410495 - I like it a lot.<br />- I do like it.
3410496 3411830 - Mm-hm.<br />- Mm!
3411831 3414416 You know, Mom, when you<br />say we met on the internet,
3414417 3415709 it's a little misleading.
3434562 3435520 Well, you need to do that
3435521 3437147 to find a good mate.
3437148 3438523 - She has a Facebook.<br />- You can't even trust
3438524 3441026 the things you hear or that<br />people write about themselves.
3441027 3442152 - Very nice.<br />- Even the pictures are
3442153 3443194 false half the time.
3443195 3444988 Is that true?<br />- Oh, it's true.
3444989 3446823 I don't think it's a<br />misconception to think
3446824 3449784 that people of good breeding<br />and success should be able
3449785 3453788 to meet potential life partners<br />in a realistic situation.
3463716 3465426 Would you, Christine?
3467845 3468845 No.
3468846 3469971 No, of course not.
3469972 3470930 What?
3470931 3472682 What, but we did.
3472683 3473975 We met at a bar, Chris.
3473976 3474851 What are you talking about?
3474852 3476478 Oh, my God, that's right.
3476479 3478063 You two better get<br />your stories straight.
3478064 3480023 It's not a Klan rally, Mom.
3480024 3481316 It's a bar.
3482568 3484362 Yeah, we met at a bar,
3485279 3486839 and we set up the date on the internet.
3488199 3489783 You okay?
3490618 3491451 You okay?
3491452 3492535 Want water?
3492536 3496289 Baby, have some, went down the wrong pipe.
3497124 3498167 Oh, my God!
3510262 3511304 I'm sorry, I don't, uh,
3511305 3513848 there must be a window open.
3513849 3515308 Chris?
3519063 3521856 Okay, I hear you!
3521857 3522857 Leave me alone!
3522858 3524692 Just leave me the hell alone!
3524693 3525527 Stop it!
3525528 3527738 Baby, there's no one there.
3530157 3531157 Okay.
3533619 3535328 I think I'd better go.
3535329 3538540 Yes, I think that would be best.
3538541 3540083 - Wait, Chris.<br />- Don't follow her.
3540084 3541459 She's a sick girl.
3541460 3542877 Mom, she needs my help.
3542878 3543921 Let her go.
3545631 3548591 Wait!
3548592 3549592 What's the matter?
3551011 3553388 Look, I did what you said!
3553389 3555515 I killed that little kitty!
3555516 3557350 You're so full of shit!
3557351 3560186 These are elusive and powerful<br />forces we are dealing with.
3560187 3562148 There are no guarantees!
3579665 3583168 We must speak directly<br />to this dark spirit.
3583169 3588006 We must dissuade it from<br />taking your soul, and soon.
3588007 3589549 I know someone who can help us.
3589550 3591843 And I'm supposed to trust you?
3591844 3594012 Tomorrow is the third day.
3594013 3596222 After that, the Lamia will come for you.
3596223 3598266 We can't let that happen.
3598267 3600351 But you must understand,
3600352 3604355 the woman who can help us must<br />put herself at great risk.
3604356 3606483 She will not do that for free.
3606484 3608151 What do you need from me?
3608152 3610529 $10,000, cash, by tomorrow.
3626670 3627837 Mr. Jacks.
3627838 3629172 Yeah?
3629173 3631633 This is kind of awkward for me,
3631634 3634427 and I know it's not official yet,
3634428 3636846 but I was wondering if<br />I could get an advance
3636847 3638181 for the new position.
3638182 3640642 What, the assistant manager's position?
3640643 3641809 Yes.
3641810 3645271 See, one of my family<br />members is really sick.
3645272 3646940 They're not gonna die,
3646941 3648399 but they could.<br />- Christine, Christine.
3648400 3650193 There's a problem.
3650194 3653029 The McPherson deal was<br />canceled last night.
3653030 3654030 What?<br />- Yeah.
3655241 3656950 Right after I informed the regional office
3656951 3658952 that we had this big loan pending,
3658953 3660411 I find out that they just made their deal
3660412 3662580 over at First National.
3662581 3664624 Now, I gotta call in to<br />see what exactly happened,
3664625 3667210 but right now, this does not look
3667211 3670088 too good for you or for me.
3670089 3674218 So, this assistant manager<br />promotion has been delayed.
3675511 3676970 In fact, you know, I think,
3676971 3678555 with everything that's been happening,
3678556 3682767 I think I'm gonna have<br />to give this job to Stu.
3682768 3683768 Stu.
3683769 3684769 I see.
3685479 3686396 I'm sorry.
3686397 3688189 Look, if you've got family problems,
3688190 3692319 maybe you should take the<br />day off, sort them out and...
3759803 3761220 So, how much?
3761221 3763473 3,800 for everything.
3763474 3764974 Including my jewelry?
3764975 3766017 Including.
3766018 3769145 But this stuff is worth<br />so much more than that.
3769146 3770188 Please.
3770189 3771731 This is all I have.
3771732 3773025 I'm begging you.
3774610 3777070 Take it or leave it.
3784995 3786454 Chris?
3786455 3787455 Chris?
3790376 3791376 Baby?
3810813 3813774 Thought you were lactose intolerant.
3814733 3815733 I am.
3817069 3821156 But then I thought, screw<br />it, I'm eating ice cream.
3823575 3825035 I paid Rham Jas.
3828789 3829789 What?
3830916 3832709 You're kidding me.
3832710 3833752 I paid him.
3835170 3838965 Why, I mean, I thought<br />that you didn't believe.
3838966 3841759 I don't know what I believe in anymore.
3841760 3846681 I really don't, but I know<br />that you believe in this.
3846682 3848433 I know how important it is to you,
3848434 3852146 and I know how much pain<br />this is causing you.
3853272 3855149 And, I also remembered,
3857693 3860487 I remembered a promise that I made
3861572 3864115 the night I fell in love with you.
3864116 3868203 I told myself that I would<br />always look out for you.
3869621 3871874 I'd always take care of you.
3872875 3874001 So I paid him.
3877463 3880465 You remember the night that<br />you fell in love with me?
3880466 3885178 I remember the second<br />I fell in love with you.
3885179 3886221 Oh, my God.
3899651 3902028 You sure you don't want<br />me to go in with you?
3902029 3903404 He said I should come alone.
3903405 3904238 Yeah, I know, I know.
3904239 3906366 He told me the same thing.
3943070 3945196 Christine, if you will<br />permit me the pleasure
3945197 3948075 of an introduction, Shaun San Dena.
3951578 3953120 Welcome.
3953121 3954914 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: How do you do?
3954915 3957333 Shaun San Dena is an experienced medium.
3957334 3960586 Furthermore, she's personally<br />been touched by the Lamia.
3960587 3964006 I first encountered<br />this spirit many years ago
3964007 3966300 in this very house.
3966301 3967969 And what happened?
3970264 3973642 I lost a young boy's soul to the beast.
3980399 3982860 I have waited these long years
3985320 3988031 for a chance at redeeming myself,
3989408 3992994 a chance to destroy the foul thing.
3992995 3995038 And--<br />- Tetiechko, please.
4000335 4002880 Tonight, my chance will come.
4004673 4007968 But to summon it, I will need your help.
4009678 4011138 Can you be strong?
4014224 4015224 I'll try.
4020689 4024275 My late husband,<br />Sandor, was also medium.
4024276 4026319 He chose this site to build a house upon
4026320 4030115 because he sensed certain<br />forces at work here.
4031533 4034494 In this place, there is a particular
4043754 4046505 A particular confluence of<br />forces which allows a doorway
4046506 4049133 to be opened through which we may pass.
4053639 4056307 And through which others<br />may pass into our world.
4062564 4064775 Please be seated.
4092636 4093719 What's going on?
4093720 4096097 Everything we're doing<br />is for your own good.
4096098 4097098 Please.
4097891 4099351 Christine, please.
4105107 4106107 Thank you.
4136471 4140933 Once the spirit has entered me,<br />put my hand upon the animal.
4140934 4142643 Do you understand?
4142644 4144145 Yes.
4144146 4147732 I force the spirit of<br />the Lamia into the goat.
4147733 4150609 Milos, that's when you strike.
4150610 4151610 Si, Tetiechko.
4153363 4154364 I understand.
4165625 4167836 We all must be receptive.
4182601 4184351 What am I supposed to do?
4184352 4186562 You must allow the darkness in.
4186563 4191150 You must invite the dead to<br />co-mingle with your spirit.
4191151 4192735 I'm scared.
4192736 4194153 Yes.
4194154 4198574 Now repeat these words:<br />I welcome the dead into my soul.
4202537 4204288 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4204289 4206791 You must believe it!
4206792 4209419 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4210837 4214048 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4215050 4224100 I welcome the dead into my soul.
4224101 4232858 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4237572 4243410 I welcome the dead into my soul!
4243411 4244578 I welcome the dead into my--
4248542 4251253 Something else is here with us.
4252504 4253504 Yes.
4282117 4284243 It is not the Lamia.
4284244 4288373 It is the spirit of some<br />unsettled soul from years ago.
4292419 4296463 Sometimes the unsettled<br />ones linger by the door.
4296464 4299176 There are others here, as well.
4309603 4311687 Begone, foolish spirits!
4311688 4312897 Begone!
4326077 4327204 She is coming.
4430765 4434561 Who now inhabits the<br />body of Shaun San Dena?
4437856 4438856 Lamia.
4446990 4449116 Lamia, what is it you desire?
4449117 4452329 I desire the soul of Christine Brown!
4453747 4457583 We will feast upon it as<br />she festers in the grave!
4457584 4458417 No!
4458418 4460169 It was my manager, Jim Jacks!
4460170 4462046 He was the one!<br />- Silence!
4462047 4464173 Lamia, surely you can be dissuaded
4464174 4466425 from taking this insignificant woman.
4466426 4469553 Surely she is not worthy<br />of your greatness.
4478313 4479313 No!
4483693 4485820 I come for you, Christine.
4489282 4490991 You're mine!
4495955 4496830 No!
4496831 4498791 You tricked me!
4498792 4501377 You black-hearted whore!
4501378 4502252 Now, Milos, now!
4502253 4503253 You bitch!
4517227 4519104 Away, unclean spirit!
4535161 4536745 Lamia!
4536746 4538705 As one who summoned you to this circle,
4538706 4540457 I command you to leave this instant!
4547799 4548799 Christine!
4555890 4559519 I don't want your cat,<br />you dirty pork queen!
4572031 4573949 Shaun San Dena!
4573950 4576827 - Si.<br />- You must banish the spirit!
4576828 4577953 Yes!
4609944 4611154 Milos!
4612030 4613906 Oh, my God.
4613907 4614740 I'm okay.
4614741 4615908 Thank God!
4615909 4616867 I'm okay.
4616868 4620454 Unbelievable!
4620455 4621663 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: You did it!
4621664 4623208 Thank God.
4624667 4625667 I tried.
4626377 4627920 Are you okay?
4627921 4629046 Oh, my God.
4629047 4630047 Help me!
4634802 4636429 Call an ambulance.
4640350 4641893 Is she breathing?
4643520 4644520 No.
4648066 4649192 Oh, my gosh.
4690900 4692484 It's so sad.
4692485 4694027 Yes.
4694028 4696363 Strange how things work out.
4696364 4698615 She waited 40 years for another chance
4698616 4700410 to overcome the Lamia,
4702078 4706207 and finally, on the last<br />night of her life, she did.
4707584 4710461 No, I'm afraid you misunderstand.
4711421 4714631 The Lamia cannot be banished by a medium.
4714632 4716800 This is our lesson tonight.
4716801 4717676 I'm sorry.
4717677 4718969 But I saw her get rid
4718970 4719803 of the thing.<br />- No.
4719804 4722431 You saw her drive it from a seance.
4722432 4723724 That is all.
4723725 4725058 It will be back.
4725059 4727603 The goat was never slaughtered.
4727604 4730480 When this night is through,
4730481 4734611 the Lamia will come for the<br />owner of the accursed object.
4737822 4740616 Unless, of course, you<br />are no longer the owner.
4740617 4742493 Do you have the button?
4750418 4754505 Make a gift of it and<br />you've given the curse away.
4757842 4759551 Why didn't you tell me this before?
4759552 4761178 Because the Lamia will tear the soul
4761179 4763305 out of whoever you give that to.
4763306 4766100 They'll burn in hell for eternity.
4767685 4771271 And I would have sent them there.
4771272 4773650 I would be your accomplice.
4775109 4778655 Whatever you decide,<br />you have till morning.
4800009 4801052 Is it over?
4802762 4803762 It's over.
4807809 4808934 Clay!
4813606 4815857 You will burn in hell!
4815858 4818151 You will burn in hell!
4818152 4821113 You bitch, you'll burn in hell!
4821114 4823407 Your turn's coming!
4823408 4824950 You will burn in hell!
4824951 4825951 You okay?
4826911 4827911 Holy shit.
4842760 4843719 Okay, you sure you're still okay
4843720 4844678 about the Santa Barbara trip?
4844679 4845637 - Yeah, I'm fine.<br />- Yeah?
4845638 4847264 And what time should I get you?
4847265 4849850 It's better if I meet<br />you at the station.
4849851 4851768 There's something I've<br />gotta do on the way.
4851769 4853520 I can do it,<br />you want me to do it on my way to--
4853521 4854521 No!<br />No.
4854522 4856857 I've got it under control.
4856858 4857899 Meet at, like, 7:30 at--
4857900 4859693 Wait!<br />Where's my envelope?
4859694 4860986 - What envelope?<br />- It was in my purse.
4860987 4862320 I just had it!
4862321 4864448 It's just an envelope.<br />- No, it's gotta be here!
4864449 4867617 It's here, so we'll find it eventually.
4867618 4868994 Oh, my God.
4868995 4871538 - Okay.<br />- I thought I'd lost it.
4871539 4872539 Okay.
4873332 4874166 Bye.<br />- 7:30.
4874167 4875293 Don't be late.
4893561 4896438 Dad, can we go to the Angel game?
4896439 4897981 What about the Dodgers?
4897982 4900150 We're only gonna be<br />in town for a few days.
4900151 4902819 But if there's a home game...
4902820 4906239 I'm sure if I just tell him<br />how much I care about you,
4906240 4907491 I mean, he's gotta understand.
4912413 4914831 Are you sure you don't want anything else?
4914832 4915665 No.
4915666 4916500 So you're just gonna sit
4916501 4918960 here drinking coffee all night long?
4918961 4919961 Yes.
4921005 4922255 Maybe!<br />What's it to you?
4922256 4924508 Honey, I make my money on tips.
4924509 4926551 Coffee drinkers don't tip.
4926552 4928094 Honey, just keep the coffee coming
4928095 4931390 or I'll give you a tip you won't forget.
4972306 4973723 Oh, my gosh.
4973724 4976768 What a delightful surprise.
4976769 4979729 Well, you're the sweetest<br />person in the world.
4982483 4984192 Never mind what it's about, Stu.
4984193 4985193 Just get here in 10 minutes
4985194 4986486 or I'm gonna tell Mr. Jacks something
4986487 4988572 you don't want me to tell him.
4988573 4990156 Oh, yeah?
4990157 4991157 Like what?
4991158 4994202 Well, for starters, that you<br />stole the McPherson loan file
4994203 4997372 off my desk and gave it to First National.
4997373 4998748 Now you got nine minutes!
5003337 5004588 Give me another.
5004589 5005589 Seriously?
5014015 5016683 Oh, God, Christine,<br />please don't tell on me.
5016684 5018727 I mean, if my dad ever finds out,
5018728 5020020 just tell me what you want.
5020021 5022105 I need to give something to you.
5022106 5023440 A little gift.
5023441 5024441 A gift?
5025735 5027068 But I don't understand.
5027069 5028028 I thought you called me down here
5028029 5030030 because I gave that<br />loan to First National.
5030031 5031364 Look, you don't need to understand!
5031365 5032366 Just shut up!
5035119 5036494 Now, this gift that I'm giving you,
5036495 5037662 it'll become your property.
5037663 5040207 You'll be the owner, all right?
5043085 5044085 Okay.
5049592 5050592 Okay.
5054055 5055055 What?
5056766 5057766 Forget it.
5059185 5060393 But I thought you wanted to give it to me
5060394 5061311 'cause of the loan stuff.
5061312 5062355 Just leave.
5065858 5067192 Okay.
5067193 5069570 Thank you so much, Christine.
5075576 5076785 But you're not gonna tell my dad, right?
5076786 5077786 Go!<br />- Okay.
5089173 5091133 Who does deserve this?
5112196 5113071 Well?
5113072 5114281 Is it possible?
5115491 5118660 There are gypsy blessings<br />bestowed upon the dead.
5118661 5120662 They give gifts to their departed
5120663 5123164 to curry favor with the deceased's soul,
5123165 5125793 for, truly, the soul never dies.
5127128 5128712 Yes.
5128713 5130296 I do believe you can give the curse
5130297 5132382 to someone who has passed on,
5132383 5133842 but you must make a formal gift
5133843 5135885 of the accursed object to the deceased.
5135886 5137679 Oh, I'll do better than that.
5137680 5140306 I'll shove it down her goddamn throat!
5140307 5141683 I'm gonna get some.
5248541 5250626 I'm giving it back to you!
5252378 5254755 You're gonna take this thing!
5256215 5258676 Are you gonna take this thing?
5261095 5262095 Take it!
5275734 5278945 That's the last of my hair you're getting!
5284034 5285578 I, Christine Brown,
5286912 5289038 do hereby make a formal gift
5289039 5292084 of this button to you, Sylvia Ganush!
5294336 5295880 Choke on it, bitch!
5311270 5312270 Goodbye.
5402027 5402986 Hi, it's Christine.
5402987 5405738 Leave a message and I'll call you back.
5405739 5408241 Christine, it's Jim, Jim Jacks.
5408242 5410243 I'm sorry I'm calling so<br />early, but last night,
5410244 5412078 I found some troubling information
5412079 5414497 about our friend Stu Rubin.
5414498 5418001 Apparently, he stole your<br />file on the McPherson loan
5418002 5421546 and then tried to broker his<br />own deal at First National.
5421547 5423423 I guess he thought we wouldn't find out.
5423424 5426217 And we wouldn't have, either,<br />except that an hour ago,
5426218 5431097 he came by my house and tried<br />to pin the whole thing on you.
5431098 5432307 After I confronted him
5432308 5434684 about a few inconsistencies in his story,
5434685 5437061 he broke down crying and, well,
5437062 5440148 we won't be seeing him around anymore.
5440149 5443526 So I just wanted you to know<br />that, come Monday morning,
5443527 5447656 that assistant manager's<br />position will be waiting for you.
5459251 5461252 <font color="#cf685c">ANNOUNCER: Passenger Benson,<br />please meet your party
5461253 5463881 at the concourse ticket counter.

5467968 5469552 - Cookie, Miss?<br />- No, thanks.

5488280 5490239 Hi. Good morning.
5490240 5493826 - I'm sorry, we're not open.<br />- Oh, I just want this coat.
5493827 5494702 We're not open yet.
5494703 5495953 My boyfriend and I are taking
5495954 5499083 this really special trip this morning.
5500250 5501250 Please?

5512137 5513054 - Hey.<br />- Hey!
5513055 5514055 Oh, man!
5514765 5516682 God, I'm so glad you're<br />here, so many things
5516683 5517558 I wanna tell you.<br />- Wait, there's something
5517559 5519519 I wanna say while I have<br />it straight in my head.
5519520 5521396 Okay.<br />Go ahead.
5521397 5524774 You never stopped believing in me.
5524775 5526318 Thank you for that.
5527694 5528528 And there's something else,
5528529 5531990 something that I couldn't admit to before.
5533033 5535368 I could have given Mrs. Ganush
5535369 5538997 another extension on<br />her loan, but I didn't.
5540165 5543710 It was my decision,<br />and it was wrong of me.
5553554 5555931 You have such a good heart.
5558225 5560686 You're so beautiful right now.
5562271 5563563 <font color="#cf685c">CHRISTINE: Do you like my new coat?
5563564 5564730 I do.<br />I really do.
5564731 5565731 What happened to the old one, though?
5565732 5566566 I threw it out.
5566567 5568067 And I never want to see it again.
5568068 5569402 Oh, no.
5569403 5571571 Oh, that's too bad, 'cause<br />I, look what I found.
5571572 5573532 I found this in the car.
5575576 5578828 And I thought maybe you could...
5578829 5581205 I thought maybe you could sew it back on.
5581206 5584542 Yeah, I think you might have<br />my Standing Liberty quarter,
5584543 5587336 'cause the envelopes<br />kind of look the same.
5587337 5589755 Chris, what's wrong?
5590799 5593968 - Oh, my God!<br />- Hey, hey, hey, hey!
5593969 5595511 Hey, hey, hey, hey!
5595512 5596387 Stop!<br />Chris!
