44674 47474 Who cares about<br />winning? Let's get drunk!
47476 48843 Now we're going<br />into the lightning round.
48845 50578 Let's do it.
50580 52112 So from now on, you'll<br />be shouting out your answers.
52114 52880 Get you drunk, Merkins.<br />You too, Borgs.
52882 55316 I'm thirsty. Huh?
55318 57618 I need four shots of vodka,<br />four shots of water.
57620 59554 I want you to send the vodka<br />over to the Merkins'.
59556 61489 Send the water to us.<br />You understand?
61491 63325 What former<br />Supreme Court Justice...
63327 65260 - Oliver Wendell Holmes!<br />- Correct.
65262 66593 Yes!
66595 69230 Again, I'd like to ask<br />the players to allow me to...
69232 70463 To finish the question.
70465 72499 Very funny.
72501 74769 Okay, okay.<br />This is getting embarrassing.
74771 76804 So we need to focus.
76806 78439 'Cause this isn't a game.
78441 80040 It literally is.
80042 82310 Bill, do not test me<br />right now.
82312 84579 Looks like we're<br />down to two teams.
84581 86647 So for double points,
86649 89650 what is the name<br />of the purple Teletubby?
89652 92488 - Tinky Winky!<br />- You're both correct.
93890 95722 He always carried a...
95724 97457 - Red purse.<br />- Yeah.
97459 100061 - And he loved big hugs.<br />- Big hugs.
100063 102564 I know. I'm Max.
102566 104064 Annie.
121584 122883 Ha-ha! You're never<br />gonna be able to
122885 124352 hold on to Asia! You hear me?
124354 126219 Hey, if you take Kamchatka,<br />and I take Mongolia,
126221 127489 we could trap Linda<br />in the middle.
127491 128755 - Starve out her armies.<br />- Hey!
128757 129957 You can't form alliances.
129959 132092 Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?
132094 134063 You're high-fiving Hitler?
135731 138199 All right,<br />you got this. Last one.
138201 141301 Oh, that's Twilight Saga:<br />Breaking Dawn.
141303 142703 Yes!
142705 143871 I'm up, I feel good.
143873 145039 Two words.
145041 146775 Bill. Overweight.
146777 148009 - No.<br />- Single. Out of work.
148011 149076 What the fuck?
149078 150610 Hairy.
150612 152347 Carry, marry.
152349 153480 Marry!
153482 155550 You. Me.
155552 156683 Marry me?
156685 158552 Dude, we got it! We got it!
158554 160253 Annie, will you?
160255 161588 Will you marry me?
161590 163790 - Is that a yes? That's a yes!<br />- Yeah!
163792 166394 I'm really happy for you guys.
179541 181474 - Lot of pressure here.<br />- Yeah.
181476 183044 You miss,<br />you lose it all.
183046 184412 Stay outta my head.
184414 185445 And you know you have<br />a distinct advantage
185447 186647 with the smaller hands, right?
186649 188316 Your goal posts<br />are not as big.
188318 189516 Well, I guess you<br />should've married Uma Thurman.
189518 190683 Yeah, that would've<br />been great.
190685 191785 There's a snap,
191787 192953 here's the hold.
192955 194955 - Ooh!<br />- And a text.
194957 196591 That was interference.
196593 198025 Sorry, honey. I know<br />how much that meant to you.
198027 200593 - Come on.<br />- Dr. Chin is ready for you.
200595 202096 Uh, great.
202098 203698 I think we've determined<br />why you've been
203700 204866 having trouble conceiving.
204868 207034 - Okay. Let's have it.<br />- Okay, great.
207036 210070 Oh, what's that look? Is it me?<br />Of course it's me.
210072 212039 I'm not loving your semen.
212041 214175 - Oh?<br />- Your count is excellent,
214177 216443 but your motility<br />is well below normal.
216445 218412 - That's too bad.<br />- What would cause that?
218414 221549 It can be genetic,<br />environmental factors.
221551 223852 Nine times out of 10, though,<br />it's psychological.
223854 226653 Have you been feeling<br />anxious or stressed?
226655 228355 No, I don't think so.<br />Not really.
228357 231126 Uh...<br />He's always a little stressed.
231128 232794 You don't have to write...<br />I'm not...
232796 233927 Honey, she's writing it down.
233929 236430 Well, Max is very competitive.
236432 237498 As am I.
237500 238598 We sure are.
238600 240134 One of the reasons<br />I fell in love with him.
240136 241568 Maybe that makes him<br />a little more prone
241570 244271 to stress than normal people.
244273 245505 "Normal people"?
245507 247342 How long has this<br />been going on, Max?
247344 248876 It's not going on.
248878 251679 Oh, well, you did say<br />even when you were a kid,
251681 253948 you would freak out<br />if you lost at anything.
253950 255181 Oh, I was a kid.
255183 256717 Especially if you lost<br />to your brother.
256719 258185 Hmm.
258187 260086 Hey, is that what this is?
260088 261155 No.
261157 262589 You have been so uptight
262591 264391 since you found out that<br />Brooks is coming to town.
264393 266060 I don't think that's true.
266062 267562 - Could that be a factor in all this?<br />- Let's be fair.
267564 270165 Sibling rivalry<br />can be very powerful.
270167 272333 Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.
272335 273867 - The what?<br />- The brothers.
273869 275435 I'm not sure<br />why we're discussing this.
275437 276903 She's not a therapist.
276905 279105 You're not a therapist, right?<br />With all respect.
279107 280673 - No, but I am a doctor.<br />- Sure.
280675 282610 And I believe in treating<br />the whole patient.
282612 284345 So, what is it<br />about your brother
284347 286280 that makes you<br />feel emasculated?
286282 287749 Are we gonna do this?
287751 289483 We're right next to the room<br />where I masturbated.
289485 292754 I think he has it in his head<br />that Brooks is cooler
292756 295956 and more successful<br />and hotter than he is.
295958 297158 I never said "hotter."
297160 298658 He's charming.
298660 301261 That's interesting.<br />And is he single?
301263 302596 What's that?
302598 303898 I don't know<br />if I mentioned it,
303900 305932 but Keith and I<br />are on a trial separation.
305934 307300 - Oh.<br />- Keith?
307302 309136 Uh, Keith.
309138 311238 So, do you think your brother would<br />wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?
311240 312406 Gosh, I don't know.
312408 313973 Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.
313975 315343 Hurts a little.
315345 318379 Now, is he a tall fella?<br />'Cause I'm only 5'2".
318381 319913 We're all done with my semen?
319915 321382 He is taller than Max.
321384 322749 Good.
322751 324252 But he did date<br />this ballerina once,
324254 325422 and she was just<br />a teeny-tiny little thing.
345107 347307 Ooh.<br />Honey, Gary.
347309 348742 Don't mention<br />game night, okay?
348744 349744 Mmm-hmm.
349746 351511 - Good evening, Max.<br />- Hey, Gary.
351513 352980 - Annie.<br />- Hello there.
352982 355182 Hi, Gary!
355184 356884 Just checking the mail.
356886 358218 Oh, yeah?
358220 359285 Some people check it<br />earlier in the day,
359287 360588 but there's always a risk
360590 363891 that the mail carrier<br />hasn't come yet.
363893 368564 This spares me the chance of<br />a futile trip to the mailbox.
370165 371764 Uh-huh.
371766 375838 Plus, it allows Bastian here<br />the opportunity to urinate.
376905 378605 You have a good one.
378607 380107 Any plans for this evening?
380109 382042 No.
382044 383509 Perhaps a game night?
383511 384677 We're just gonna stay in,
384679 386314 - just the two of us.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
386316 388182 - Boring.<br />- Mmm.
388184 390617 I see.
390619 394891 I do hope you keep me in mind<br />for any future game nights.
395758 397089 You bet.
397091 400627 I've always enjoyed the<br />camaraderie of good friends
400629 404230 competing in games<br />of chance and skill.
404232 406968 Yeah. Yeah, well,<br />we'll do that,
406970 411338 but tonight it's just<br />the two of us.
411340 414611 Three bags of Tostitos Scoops,<br />I notice.
420316 423016 There was a special<br />on these tonight.
423018 424718 Three for one.
424720 426553 Three for one?
426555 427687 Yup.
427689 429792 How can that be profitable<br />for Frito-Lay?
431093 432996 These corporations,
434297 435428 I don't know<br />what they're doing.
436566 439766 Well, you two<br />enjoy each other.
439768 444574 It's often we don't appreciate<br />what we have until it's gone.
448677 450343 - I think that's it.<br />- Okay.
450345 451648 Bye-bye!
457819 459954 If Gary sees the others<br />coming, we're screwed.
459956 461588 No, no, honey,<br />it's not gonna be a problem.
461590 463824 I was very clear with everyone<br />to park far away
463826 466060 and just to sneak in quietly,<br />you know.
466062 467360 But now, I mean,
467362 468629 you don't think<br />we're being dicks, do you?
468631 469930 Should we just<br />still invite the guy?
469932 471264 He really seemed<br />like he wanted to play.
471266 473367 No, no.<br />Debbie was our friend,
473369 474468 and Gary was just<br />the creepy husband
474470 475737 that we had to put up with.
475739 476870 That's true.
476872 478538 He's only gotten worse<br />since the divorce.
478540 481108 Yeah, we don't owe him<br />anything, right? Fuck him!
507737 508968 Hi!
508970 510473 Hi.
513609 515409 Can we help you?
515411 517110 I'm okay.
517112 518745 Hey!
518747 520080 Of course. Ryan, why are you<br />coming in through the window?
520082 523450 You said sneak in so RoboCop<br />wouldn't see us.
523452 525086 I meant sneak in<br />through the door.
525088 526385 Well, you were super vague.
526387 527788 - I wasn't vague at all.<br />- Wine?
527790 529222 I know I didn't say,<br />"Break the succulents."
529224 530923 Hey.
530925 532592 I'm not dressed for this nonsense.<br />This is ridiculous.
532594 533927 It's like Night<br />of the Living Dead in here.
533929 535596 Yeah, you are asking<br />a lot from us, Max.
535598 536830 I didn't say to come<br />through the window.
536832 538533 This is Max.<br />We used to work together.
538535 540533 His wife, Annie. Michelle,<br />and that guy's Kevin.
540535 542001 - What's up, buddy?<br />- The door's right there.
542003 543004 Guys, this is Madison.
543006 544538 Yeah, you brought her<br />last week.
544540 546506 You work at Forever 21, right?
546508 548609 - No, no.<br />- I work at Sephora.
548611 551144 - I'm confused.<br />- Different girl.
551146 552879 Same look, same voice.
552881 553947 Nice to meet you.
553949 555651 You, too.
557719 559219 - That's yours.<br />- It's...
559221 561688 No. I think you're<br />supposed to kiss it, right?
561690 562722 Welcome.
562724 564158 Do you guys have a bathroom?
564160 565659 There's one just down<br />the hall. You need it?
565661 567427 Okay, is it on<br />the right or the left?
567429 569129 I don't wanna go<br />in the wrong room.
569131 570331 The one with the toilet.
570333 571398 - Can't miss it.<br />- Okay.
574303 575501 - Oh, boy.<br />- Dude!
575503 576870 - Oh. Wow.<br />- Right?
576872 578139 Where'd you find her?<br />A TED Talk?
578141 579407 No, at Chipotle.
579409 580807 Let me ask you<br />something, Ryan.
580809 582341 Aren't you sick of losing<br />game night every week
582343 583543 because of the dates<br />you bring?
583545 585812 They're not always that bad.
588483 590083 Heather, seriously.
590085 591653 How many photos of you with<br />the dog filter do you need?
593554 595755 "Dennis" isn't a word.
595757 598158 Yeah, it is.<br />It's my daddy's name, so...
598160 601327 These are the elite,<br />the very best, the...
601329 602562 Oh, oh. White people!
602564 604297 - What?<br />- Oh, Jesus.
604299 605666 Okay, unlike you psychos,
605668 607634 I don't give a shit<br />about winning game night.
607636 609269 I don't need that validation.
609271 611873 But you do need the validation<br />of dating Instagram models?
611875 613139 Absolutely.
613141 615442 I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br />I'm not like you, Michelle.
615444 616809 We didn't all meet<br />our soulmate
616811 618078 when we were 10 years old.
618080 619145 Fourteen.
619147 620414 - Oh, sorry.<br />- Fourteen.
620416 621916 And we didn't get married<br />until we were 19.
621918 623450 - See, that's gross.<br />- You know what, Ryan?
623452 626019 I hope one day you get to meet<br />a lovely, young lady.
626021 628589 So you can love her as much as I<br />love my sweet baby right here.
628591 630557 Yes, find her.<br />Look how cute this...
630559 631825 - Hey, look at this.<br />- So much love.
631827 633059 Let's look at him<br />when we do it.
633061 634562 - Hey, everybody.<br />- Find the love!
634564 635828 Grab your drinks.<br />Let's go play, come on.
635830 637865 Dude, do you know<br />what rich people
637867 639432 are doing on their game<br />nights these days?
639434 640768 What's that?
640770 642269 - Fight clubs.<br />- What?
642271 643604 I just read about 'em.
643606 645306 They pay poor people<br />to fight each other,
645308 646841 and then they bet<br />on the winner.
646843 648708 - No, that's not a real thing.<br />- Yes, it is!
648710 650344 If you can have anything<br />you want in this world,
650346 652846 you have to raise the stakes<br />or life gets boring.
652848 654815 The Kennedys used to have<br />fight clubs at their compound.
654817 656616 Honey, listen, you gotta<br />stop reading BuzzFeed
656618 658118 every second of the damn day.
658120 659720 How about some Charades?<br />Should we start with Charades?
659722 660788 - Let's go!<br />- Yeah!
660790 661989 It's been a while, huh?
661991 663591 Do you wanna wait for Brooks?
663593 665091 I don't think we need to.<br />No, he's late.
665093 666125 Wait, hold up.
666127 667494 - Brooks is in town?<br />- Yeah.
667496 669062 I thought he was working<br />in Europe.
669064 671264 He was, yeah. He's apparently<br />back for some business.
671266 672399 Haven't seen him yet.
672401 674366 - But we can get started.<br />- Yeah!
674368 675469 Who wants to start?
675471 677137 Who are you guys<br />talking about?
677139 679605 Max's brother. He's this super<br />successful venture capitalist.
679607 680874 Yeah, he was<br />the first to invest
680876 682176 in Panera Bread, you know?
682178 684077 The Fuji Apple Salad<br />was his idea.
684079 685611 - A lot of investors.<br />- Yeah.
685613 687581 He's like the Mark Wahlberg<br />to Max's Donnie.
687583 689350 Well...
689352 691384 Which is a huge compliment<br />because Donnie was fucking great
691386 692485 in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?
692487 693653 He was.
693655 695121 Was he in The Sixth Sense?
695123 696255 He sure is, yeah.
696257 697357 You know who is not<br />in The Sixth Sense?
697359 698692 Mark Wahlberg.
698694 701264 Mark would never take<br />a role that small.
702899 704932 Is that right, Madison?
704934 706667 Man, I haven't seen him<br />since the wedding.
706669 708668 - Remember that speech he gave?<br />- Yes.
708670 710236 And then he paid for that<br />whole fireworks display!
710238 711806 - Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!<br />- Little over the top.
711808 713407 Let's get started.<br />I'm gonna start us off.
713409 714740 Yes, let's start!
714742 716176 We gotta pick teams first.
716178 717778 - Movie?<br />- It's a movie. Okay.
717780 719211 Dude, we have no teams.
719213 721481 - You just give up?<br />- Better not be Brooks.
735330 737730 You didn't tell him<br />to park up the street?
737732 739636 I did, yeah,<br />like, three times.
740135 741538 Hey!
742338 744707 He got a Stingray, huh?
747809 749609 Turn off your car!
749611 750980 What's that?
753549 755316 Hello, again.
755318 756616 Mmm...
756618 758620 Still wearing the uniform.
759756 761187 Hey, bud,<br />I'm sorry I'm late.
761189 763389 I hope you didn't start<br />game night without me.
765327 766592 Did you not get my texts?
766594 768495 What text?
768497 769933 Oh, hello, Officer.
771633 773299 Why's that guy staring at us?
773301 775168 Gary, I want you<br />to meet my brother, Brooks.
775170 778806 We're having a little family<br />three-man game night tonight.
778808 780273 Wait, what do you mean<br />three-man?
780275 781841 You said that Michelle<br />and Ryan and Kevin were...
781843 783476 No, no, no.<br />Just gonna be us three.
783478 784879 I can see 'em in the doorway.
784881 786846 There's a whole mess<br />of people. Hey, guys!
786848 788716 - There they are.<br />- Hey!
788718 789883 These guys are leaving.
789885 791284 Take off, guys.
791286 793322 We had a little bit<br />of a mix-up with the...
794357 795923 - God damn it!<br />- What?
795925 797591 We didn't want him to know<br />we were having a game night.
797593 801128 He used to come, and we don't<br />like him anymore, so...
801130 802729 Oh.
802731 804230 You know,<br />I think he knows now.
804232 805566 He sure does.
805568 808969 Maxi Pad,<br />come on, bring it in.
808971 812505 I haven't<br />seen you in a year!
812507 815542 Hey, you smell good.
815544 816876 What is that?
816878 818745 Is that Selsun Blue?<br />Head and Shoulders?
818747 820313 Why do you assume<br />it's a dandruff shampoo?
820315 821716 Well, I mean,<br />you've always been
821718 823017 a little bit of a snowstorm.
823019 824051 Hey, would you<br />hold that for a second?
824053 825686 - Yup.<br />- Hey, guys!
825688 828389 - You look good, stranger.<br />- Wanna drink?
828391 829756 It's been forever.
829758 831325 I know, and that's my fault.<br />I'm so sorry.
831327 832926 Sweet ride, Brooks.
832928 834961 Oh, you like that? I just<br />got her a couple weeks ago.
834963 836263 What is that? A Corvette?
836265 839466 It's a 1976 rally red<br />Stingray coupe.
839468 840868 It was my dream car as a kid.
840870 842769 And that's what gave me<br />the idea to get it.
842771 844873 You know what?<br />I love your house.
845708 846940 Are you being sarcastic?
846942 848140 No, I mean, I love your house.
848142 849976 It reminds me<br />of Mom and Dad's.
849978 851979 Makes me think<br />of simpler times.
851981 853013 Simpler?
853015 855014 So how long<br />are you in town for?
855016 856082 You know, I'm not sure.
856084 857884 It depends on how many clients
857886 859786 the firm's gonna be having me<br />schmooze while I'm here.
860923 862121 But hopefully for a while.
862123 864426 I don't get to see you guys,<br />and I...
866194 869062 God, I really miss you, man.<br />I really do.
869064 870929 Oh.
870931 872365 Miss you, too, Brooks.
872367 874835 And go!
874837 876570 Shock-rocker.<br />Dated Rose McGowan.
876572 878205 Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.
878207 879272 Yep. You got it.
879274 880975 - Quick story.<br />- There's no pausing.
880977 882275 You remember<br />the urban myth where
882277 884110 Marilyn Manson<br />had the ribs taken out,
884112 885678 so he could go down<br />on himself?
885680 887113 Yeah.
887115 888115 You don't mind me telling<br />the story, do you, Max?
888117 889548 You're in the middle of a...
889550 891652 You were 14 years old.<br />It's an adorable story.
891654 892851 I forbid it.
892853 895322 I'm a little curious.
895324 897191 Did you blow yourself?
897193 899158 You know the bungee cords<br />on roof racks?
899160 901828 - Yeah.<br />- Max took one of those bungee cords
901830 902895 and he put it around his neck.
902897 904130 Here he goes.
904132 905631 And then he wrapped it<br />behind his legs,
905633 907833 so he could squish his face<br />down into his crotch.
907835 909336 But the problem was
909338 912239 that it got stuck!<br />He couldn't unhook it.
912241 915075 And about an hour later,
915077 917711 Mom comes home,<br />and she finds him there.
917713 919211 Shit!
919213 920815 Her little pretzel boy<br />on his bedroom floor naked.
920817 923216 Little pretzel boy?
923218 925519 Great story.<br />Are we back on now?
925521 927053 So?
927055 927922 So what?
927924 929322 Did you suck it?
929324 930956 Let's go. Come on. Brooks.
930958 933192 Back to it. Come on.<br />Play the game.
933194 935229 Poor man's Johnny Depp,<br />starred in Jericho.
935231 937063 Skeet Ulrich.
937065 939666 UN Secretary General,<br />'92 to '96.
939668 941134 Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
941136 943937 This guy. He hated kids<br />in Jurassic Park.
943939 945172 Sam Neill.
945174 947039 Dubstep DJ,<br />looks like Corey Feldman.
947041 948308 - Skrillex.<br />- Yep.
948310 949442 Rappers love<br />this Cubist painter.
949444 950443 Picasso!
950445 951845 Big cat shot<br />by asshole dentist.
951847 953346 - Cecil the lion!<br />- Time!
953348 955548 - How many?<br />- Seven!
955550 958121 Seven!
959088 960519 You're up, pretzel boy.
960521 961822 Whoo! Go, Max!
961824 963791 - Come on, Max.<br />- All right. Here we go.
963793 965828 And kick it, go!
967630 968895 Oh, this is easy!
968897 970364 Annie, the famous actor<br />that we met
970366 972068 at the airport<br />about eight years ago.
973535 975034 Who?
975036 976471 Only actor we've ever met<br />at an airport who's famous.
977272 978437 Bobby Flay?
978439 979639 Not an actor.
979641 981475 This fellow was in front of us<br />at the Sbarro.
981477 983876 We were wondering why he wasn't<br />in the first-class lounge.
983878 986013 Oh, yes, yes.
986015 987313 Who was that?
987315 988715 God damn it!
988717 989850 Max, there's a whole room of<br />people to help you out here.
989852 991018 - Use us.<br />- Good point.
991020 993287 He was the Incredible Hulk.
993289 994455 Eric Bana.
994457 996190 - Other one.<br />- Uh, Mark Ruffalo.
996192 998024 - Other one.<br />- Lou Ferrigno.
998026 1000094 Holy shit! Primal Fear.
1000096 1001894 Richard Gere never played<br />the Incredible Hulk.
1001896 1004163 - Time.<br />- Motherfucking Ed Norton!
1004165 1005432 Oh!
1005434 1006600 Primal Fear!
1006602 1007801 Oh, my God!
1007803 1009068 He was the Hulk.
1009070 1010637 - The Hulk.<br />- I forgot that.
1010639 1012505 Max. Zero points.
1012507 1015375 I'd say he blew it,<br />but he won't tell us, will he?
1018078 1019980 Shit! Did you?
1019982 1022349 I can't believe<br />I didn't get Bob Barker.
1022351 1023616 Hey, guys!
1023618 1025284 What do you say we do this<br />at my house next week?
1025286 1026452 - House? What house?<br />- Ooh. Really?
1026454 1027988 Since I don't know<br />how long
1027990 1029355 I'm gonna be here,<br />I rented a place.
1029357 1030957 It's only a couple miles away.
1030959 1032491 You know,<br />it's up on Broadmoor.
1032493 1033861 Ooh! Swanky neighborhood.
1033863 1036997 It's a very cool house.<br />But it's just me there alone.
1036999 1039065 It'd be great<br />to have you guys come over.
1039067 1041534 Oh, well,<br />it's kind of a tradition
1041536 1042869 to have game nights here.
1042871 1044238 But you know what?
1044240 1046205 Let's let him show off<br />his big house, huh?
1046207 1047840 That's the spirit!
1047842 1050210 Trust me,
1050212 1054580 this will be a game night<br />to remember.
1054582 1055882 - Oh, boy.<br />- Mmm.
1055884 1057683 - Promise?<br />- Good night, everybody.
1057685 1059152 I love you much. Drive safely.
1059154 1060354 - Kisses!<br />- All right.
1060356 1061887 - Take it easy.<br />- Bye.
1061889 1064593 That little motherfucker.
1065228 1066124 Whoa!
1066126 1068361 Well, I mean, come on.
1068363 1070763 We don't see him<br />in over a year.
1070765 1073467 He shows up<br />in your dream car,
1073469 1074634 insults our house,
1074636 1076435 and then tells an embarrassing<br />story about you,
1076437 1078805 right before your turn just<br />to throw you off your game.
1078807 1080173 Welcome to my whole life.
1080175 1081607 Why are you suddenly<br />so worked up about it?
1081609 1083410 Well, 'cause now he's messing<br />with your balls
1083412 1085878 and literally killing<br />millions of our babies.
1085880 1087448 Well,<br />that's a little dramatic,
1087450 1089415 but, yeah, you know.<br />I mean, that's Brooks.
1089417 1091652 I thought that this was just<br />regular old brother stuff,
1091654 1093319 - but I totally see it now.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1093321 1095521 He undermines you<br />every chance he gets.
1095523 1096522 Yeah. Yeah.
1096524 1098525 - It's crazy!<br />- Thank you, Annie.
1098527 1100693 I've never won<br />a single game against him.
1100695 1104666 I just... I think we gotta<br />fix this Brooks thing.
1105867 1107166 - Fix it?<br />- Yeah.
1107168 1108268 What are you suggesting?
1108270 1110569 I'm suggesting<br />we beat his ass.
1110571 1112440 Jesus Christ.
1113876 1115541 Good evening.
1115543 1117646 We're gonna skip the cleanup?
1123085 1124917 Sure you don't wanna<br />take a Lyft?
1124919 1126685 No, no. I am not getting<br />drunk tonight.
1126687 1128020 - Good evening!<br />- I'm gonna stay alert and ready.
1128022 1130123 Jesus, Gary!
1130125 1131357 Where are you headed?
1131359 1134794 We are going to, uh,<br />to my brother's.
1134796 1136963 Another game night?
1136965 1139633 No. No, absolutely not.
1139635 1142035 We're going to, um,
1142037 1144538 - have some dinner.<br />- Eat.
1144540 1146138 I see.
1146140 1148040 Pity. I was going<br />to invite you over
1148042 1150778 for a dinner I'm hosting.
1150780 1153512 I've purchased<br />four lamb shanks
1153514 1155647 that I've been simmering<br />in a broth
1155649 1158751 of red wine and rosemary.
1158753 1161821 - That sounds so yummy, though.<br />- Damn it.
1161823 1165357 It was actually<br />Debbie's recipe.
1165359 1169095 I like to think she left<br />behind her recipe cards
1169097 1170963 as a gesture of goodwill,
1170965 1176171 but it was most likely<br />an unintentional oversight.
1182010 1185114 Well, here we go.
1186147 1187582 What?
1188716 1190051 I'm sorry?
1190918 1192919 I thought you said something.
1192921 1195355 - No.<br />- Nope, not us.
1195357 1196358 Okay.
1199159 1201062 Have fun.
1204265 1206866 Oh, fuck me.
1206868 1208634 A guy who rents a house<br />this big
1208636 1210202 must be making up<br />for something
1210204 1211838 pretty small, I'd say.
1211840 1214574 No, no. No, I've seen his dick.<br />It's pretty great.
1214576 1216412 Well, I tried.
1217913 1219278 - Hey!<br />- Hey!
1219280 1220880 - Hey!<br />- How are you doing, beautiful?
1220882 1222883 - Good, good. Really fancy.<br />- Very nice house, Tony Stark.
1222885 1225786 Should we give our drink<br />orders to JARVIS?
1225788 1227353 No, I got the Tony Stark part,
1227355 1228688 but then you went<br />full nerd on me.
1228690 1230257 I kinda lost you,<br />but please do come in.
1230259 1231590 - All right.<br />- Thanks, Cap.
1231592 1233292 - Hi, guys!<br />- What's up?
1233294 1237029 Boy, could sleep four<br />on that couch. Look at that.
1237031 1238733 Oh, hello, friends.
1239799 1242535 Hey, let me introduce you<br />to my date. This is Sarah.
1242537 1244604 Sarah is head of company<br />accounting at our office.
1244606 1246138 Well,<br />corporate communications.
1246140 1247574 And she's also British,
1247576 1249142 which means<br />she's smart as shit.
1249144 1250977 - I'm Irish.<br />- Okay? Same island.
1250979 1252412 Well, it's really not.
1252414 1253311 - Nice to meet you. Hi.<br />- Nice to meet you, too.
1253313 1254547 - I'm Max.<br />- Annie.
1254549 1255816 So, you can't<br />always judge a book
1255818 1257584 by its past covers, can you?
1257586 1259618 - Mmm.<br />- Almost a saying.
1259620 1260953 - Here you go.<br />- Hey, Brooks.
1260955 1262221 - Cheers.<br />- We didn't know
1262223 1263522 if you had any games,<br />so we thought
1263524 1265192 we'd bring you<br />a few of our favorites.
1265194 1266893 Hey, look at that.
1266895 1268627 Whoa!
1268629 1270196 - Huh.<br />- The poor games.
1270198 1272397 I told you<br />we're taking it up a notch.
1272399 1275402 The game that we're gonna<br />play tonight is so epic
1275404 1277804 that we don't need a board,<br />and we do not need pieces.
1277806 1279772 Still didn't need<br />to throw them across the room.
1279774 1281107 I was being theatrical.
1281109 1283076 Holy shit!<br />Are we doing a fight club?
1283078 1284711 A what?
1284713 1286046 It's when rich people pay poor<br />people to fight each other...
1286048 1287180 Hey, hey, hey!<br />Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.
1287182 1288182 Stop with<br />the fight club, okay.
1288184 1290115 - It's nonsense.<br />- No.
1290117 1291683 Ryan believes<br />everything he reads.
1291685 1292751 Thank you.
1292753 1295190 So, what are we playing?
1298159 1299926 In the next hour,
1299928 1302828 someone in this room<br />is going to be taken,
1302830 1304497 and it's gonna be up to you<br />to find them
1304499 1306132 before they are murdered.
1306134 1308167 Oh! It's a murder<br />mystery party.
1308169 1309702 Not just<br />any murder mystery.
1309704 1311871 I found this company.<br />They do it super real.
1311873 1313373 They use legit actors.
1313375 1316143 You're not gonna know<br />what's real and what's fake.
1316145 1318010 - Fun!<br />- But that's not all.
1318012 1320145 Because whoever<br />finds the victim
1320147 1322617 wins the grand prize.
1324319 1326118 The keys to the Stingray.
1326120 1327953 - What?<br />- Wow.
1327955 1330256 Just the keys?
1330258 1331958 No, Ryan, the whole car.
1331960 1333993 Oh, yes! Oh, man!
1333995 1335694 You're so lucky I brought you<br />to this game night
1335696 1338263 - and not one of Max and Annie's.<br />- Hey!
1338265 1339932 No, I just mean<br />'cause this is better.
1339934 1341300 Oh.
1341302 1342602 You're not gonna actually<br />give away your car?
1342604 1344737 Oh, it's just a tax write-off.
1344739 1347574 And the Audi,<br />it's more practical.
1347576 1349174 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
1349176 1351076 Okay. How do we start?
1351078 1353279 We just wait for it to begin.
1353281 1355749 Maybe play a drinking game<br />to pass the time?
1355751 1358151 This group does not play<br />drinking games.
1358153 1360621 Tonight we do, Max.
1360623 1362521 - Oh. "Never Have I Ever."<br />- Good one!
1362523 1364156 Can you believe<br />this guy?
1364158 1366226 Yeah,<br />he's ridiculous.
1366228 1367859 Beautiful house, though.
1367861 1369564 Good champagne.
1373402 1375404 Here we go.
1376471 1379271 Yup. We're at the house.
1379273 1381443 We'll let you know<br />when we have him.
1397291 1399491 Jesus Christ!
1399493 1401426 What's with that knife?
1401428 1403229 It's for the cheese.
1403231 1405733 Okay, all right.<br />Just, you know,
1406799 1408167 really aggressive way<br />to carry a knife.
1408169 1409836 Oh no, I've got one.
1409838 1413506 Never have I ever<br />connected my work computer
1413508 1414840 to the projector<br />in the conference room
1414842 1417442 when it was open<br />on a WebMD page
1417444 1418744 for chlamydia symptoms.
1418746 1421013 - That's not cool!<br />- Drink!
1421015 1423115 Just for the record,<br />I did not have chlamydia.
1423117 1424351 It was pubic dermatitis.
1424353 1426086 You get it from<br />not washing your crotch.
1426088 1427421 - Okay.<br />- Good for you.
1427423 1429789 I... I like her.
1429791 1432092 Listen, you're not supposed to<br />single people out in this game.
1432094 1434294 It's supposed to be<br />generic things, like,
1434296 1436162 "Never have I ever slept<br />with a celebrity."
1436164 1438263 Oh, I didn't know. Okay.
1438265 1439432 Whoops.
1439434 1440733 - Mmm?<br />- Ooh.
1443672 1444637 What?
1444639 1446605 You slept with a celebrity?
1446607 1448874 No, I was taking a drink<br />separate from the game.
1448876 1450644 - That was bad timing.<br />- Mmm.
1450646 1452278 I see how you would<br />think, but it's not.
1452280 1453579 Well, then why<br />are you breathing
1453581 1455413 like you just got off<br />the elliptical?
1455415 1457284 I'm not. I'm...
1457286 1459619 Come on, babe.<br />Whose turn is it?
1459621 1462454 Uh, it's Max.<br />Max, it's your turn. Huh?
1462456 1464324 I'm not playing a drinking<br />game. Who was it?
1464326 1465892 What's the deal with that?
1465894 1467493 They've been<br />together since middle school.
1467495 1468327 Uh, it's somebody<br />else's turn.
1468329 1469796 - Oh. Oh!<br />- Yeah!
1469798 1471265 How could you possibly have<br />had sex with a celebrity
1471267 1472932 when we've only had sex<br />with each other?
1472934 1475268 Please, can you not make this<br />one of your things right now?
1475270 1476903 How is this one of my things?
1476905 1480173 Yeah, Brooks, this is why<br />we don't play drinking games.
1482944 1485010 It looks like<br />the game is afoot.
1485012 1486246 Oh!
1486248 1487780 Thank you, God!
1487782 1489952 Oh, boy.<br />Let's buckle up, huh?
1492154 1495188 - Brooks Davis?<br />- Yes.
1495190 1496923 - Oh, shit.<br />- Ooh!
1496925 1498460 This is good.
1499094 1500963 Agent Henderson.
1501796 1502796 FBI.
1502798 1505865 Sunglasses at night.<br />It's legit.
1505867 1506868 Sit down, please.
1508103 1509603 I'll get right to the point.
1509605 1512704 The Bureau has been tracking
1512706 1514539 a ring<br />of violent kidnappers
1514541 1517477 in this very neighborhood.
1517479 1520949 And we have reason to believe<br />that one of you
1522183 1523516 may be their next victim.
1525521 1526653 That's terrible news.
1526655 1529955 Contained within<br />these dossiers
1529957 1533826 are the clues you will require<br />to find the kidnappers.
1533828 1536162 You'd like for us<br />to do that, yeah?
1536164 1538531 The Bureau's... What's<br />the Bureau's role in this?
1538533 1540499 Maybe you guys could take<br />my wife in for questioning
1540501 1541933 because, apparently,<br />she got a secret life
1541935 1543269 - I don't know nothing about.<br />- Baby, this is...
1543271 1544606 Shut up, all of you!
1545339 1546574 Wow.
1547408 1549308 It's not a joke.
1549310 1550609 You people are in real danger,
1550611 1552044 and you're<br />running out of time.
1552046 1555949 And I, Agent Henderson,<br />will not stand idly by
1555951 1560118 while innocent civilians<br />are slaughtered on my watch.
1560120 1561453 I told you<br />this is gonna be great.
1561455 1563155 - It's so good!<br />- So good.
1563157 1564790 But before we get started,
1564792 1566994 I'm required to ask if any of<br />you have any food allergies.
1567729 1568764 Peanuts?
1569496 1570696 Who the hell are you?
1570698 1572164 Oh!
1572166 1573999 Now, wait a second. I know<br />you're method and all,
1574001 1575836 but you can't just come in here<br />and break the door.
1575838 1578337 I do not mind this game.
1578339 1580007 Are you crazy?
1594990 1596825 It's very well done.
1598026 1599692 No!
1599694 1602528 That is a strong table.
1602530 1604196 Oh, watch out!<br />He's packing heat!
1604198 1605298 Hell no!
1610637 1612840 Oh! Oh!
1636297 1637533 Come on!
1650278 1653179 You're just making<br />this harder on yourself!
1656184 1657983 Oh, shit!
1657985 1660586 Guys, make sure you get a piece<br />of this cheese. It's just...
1660588 1661721 Cut me one.
1661723 1663122 Try it with the quince.
1670632 1672597 Oh, my God!
1672599 1673833 Now he's back.
1673835 1675134 Stop fighting, asshole!
1675136 1676236 Help me! This isn't...
1676238 1678837 The Independent Spirit Award<br />goes to...
1678839 1681007 Let's go!
1681009 1682008 Bye-bye!
1682010 1683742 First one that follows us<br />gets shot!
1683744 1685545 Okay, roger that.<br />You drive safe.
1685547 1687613 Come on,<br />motherfucker!
1687615 1688949 - Bye.<br />- That was amazing.
1688951 1689882 Really good.
1689884 1691218 - That was really good.<br />- Wow.
1691220 1693385 Mmm. No, there's something<br />about this
1693387 1695989 that just doesn't feel right.
1695991 1698324 How could you cheat on me<br />with a celebrity?
1698326 1699792 I didn't cheat on you.
1699794 1702428 It was before we got married<br />when we took that break.
1702430 1704698 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1704700 1706132 I've been living<br />in the matrix.
1706134 1709236 Agent Henderson, you just<br />gonna keep lying there?
1709238 1710368 Is any of this real?
1710370 1712137 Well, don't kick him!
1712139 1713071 Stop.
1713073 1714673 He's a regular<br />Daniel Day-Lewis.
1714675 1716575 I thought<br />we both agreed
1716577 1718576 that we wouldn't hook up with<br />anybody else during that break.
1718578 1721212 Yeah, but then you went and got<br />a hand job from Karen Waller.
1721214 1723016 - No, don't do that.<br />- Boop! Boop! Boop!
1723018 1725183 Because it was over<br />the pants, all right?
1725185 1726618 It was, and it hurt.
1726620 1728387 It was very dry,<br />and I didn't climax.
1728389 1730288 Just admit it,<br />you guys did more than that.
1730290 1732491 Don't turn this around on me.<br />Do not do that.
1732493 1734026 Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!
1734028 1735260 Damn it,<br />they got the jump on us.
1735262 1737096 - Come on. Come on now!<br />- Shit, Kev!
1737098 1739198 All right. Here's the first<br />clue. Looks like a riddle.
1739200 1740633 "With shiny fangs..."
1740635 1742201 "...my bloodless bite..."
1742203 1745438 "...will bring together what's<br />mostly white."
1745440 1747140 Donald Trump.
1747142 1751477 "Bloodless bite."<br />It's not a vampire. Um...
1751479 1752878 I'll just google it.
1752880 1754313 It's so inconsistent,<br />isn't it?
1754315 1756016 I mean, they stage this<br />super realistic fight.
1756018 1758951 They give us an FBI dossier<br />but with riddles.
1758953 1760853 It's like, let's pick a tone.<br />Let's stick with it.
1760855 1762821 But that's the game.<br />You wanna win this car or not?
1762823 1764256 Yeah, yeah.<br />More than anything,
1764258 1765924 but I feel like Brooks<br />is setting me up.
1765926 1767593 Do you get that feeling,<br />you know?
1767595 1769528 That this is some game
1769530 1771198 where somehow<br />he's gonna humiliate me?
1773201 1775166 Mmm-hmm.
1775168 1778104 Well, let's not play<br />by his rules.
1778106 1780173 "My bloodless bite,<br />my bloodless, bloodless bite.
1780175 1782342 "Bloodless bite, bloodless<br />bite, bloodless bite."
1782344 1785444 Can you stop chanting<br />"bloodless bite"?
1785446 1787480 - Trying to think.<br />- Yeah.
1787482 1790249 Oh, shit!
1790251 1793118 Max and Annie must have<br />figured it out.
1793120 1795788 Right. We need to find<br />an advantage.
1795790 1799124 Advantage, advantage,<br />advantage...
1799126 1800426 Brooks' wallet?
1800428 1802930 Oh, you think we should steal<br />all of his shit!
1803364 1804430 No.
1807970 1808968 Wait.
1808970 1810935 Hi, yeah.<br />I lost my credit card.
1810937 1812971 I was wondering if you could tell me<br />what the last few charges I made were.
1812973 1814807 What are you doing?
1814809 1816875 If we can find out the name of the<br />murder mystery place he used,
1816877 1818344 we can go to their office and pay<br />them off to give us the final clue.
1818346 1819980 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1819982 1824051 You're, like, a double threat.<br />Brains, and you're British.
1825153 1826085 Thanks.
1826087 1828855 Okay. What has shiny fangs
1828857 1831824 that bites<br />white things together?
1831826 1832991 A stapler!
1832993 1835127 And the white things<br />are paper.
1835129 1838664 Yes! You are so smart<br />and unfaithful!
1838666 1841002 - Oh, there it is.<br />- Yes!
1841869 1843702 Look at that.
1843704 1845741 - Flash drive.<br />- Put it in the desktop.
1848076 1849708 Okay.
1849710 1851176 Another riddle.
1851178 1854279 "I'm brown and old by day,<br />white and young by night.
1854281 1855247 "My eyes are glass.
1855249 1857249 "I have nine faces<br />but no head.
1857251 1859085 "I sing to the sky<br />but have no voice.
1859087 1861956 "I'm everywhere and nowhere."
1863758 1865458 What the fuck is that?
1866861 1868192 I mean, how cool<br />are we? Right?
1868194 1869729 Very, very cool.<br />We are very cool.
1869731 1871230 You're the cool one.
1871232 1873566 You know, tracking the phone<br />is just a great idea.
1873568 1875233 Still on Route 18, huh?
1875235 1877002 We're catching up to him.<br />Here we come, Brooksie.
1877004 1878703 Can you imagine<br />the look on his face
1878705 1879972 when we find him so fast?
1879974 1882040 You know, baby,<br />I can feel my sperm
1882042 1883609 already coming back to life.
1883611 1884810 - Perfect.<br />- Yeah.
1884812 1886378 So we'll win<br />your brother's car,
1886380 1887980 and then we'll go make<br />a baby in it.
1887982 1889382 Yeah! We'll make him watch us.
1889384 1891017 - Yeah.<br />- Huh?
1891019 1892851 - I don't wanna do that.<br />- No, me neither.
1892853 1894086 Sorry, don't know<br />why I said that.
1894088 1895255 - I'm not into that.<br />- Not a great idea.
1895257 1896488 Okay.
1896490 1898024 Okay, great. Thank you.<br />All right, I got the name
1898026 1899124 and the address<br />of the games company.
1899126 1900392 - Let's go.<br />- Yes!
1900394 1901527 All we have to do now,
1901529 1903762 figure out what<br />"bloodless bite" means.
1903764 1906265 No, we don't. That's why...
1906267 1908901 - Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.<br />- Doesn't matter. Let's go.
1908903 1910402 How you gonna<br />be old and young?
1910404 1912837 - That doesn't make sense.<br />- I know.
1912839 1915307 Guys, hey, how's it goin'?
1915309 1918611 I just wanted to wish you<br />the best of luck tonight. Bye.
1921648 1922882 - No.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1922884 1924416 What are...<br />What are you doing?
1924418 1926018 Just being a dick.
1926020 1928220 Oh, come on.
1928222 1930522 - Don't kick him, Ryan!<br />- He's such a good actor!
1930524 1931759 Ryan!
1932694 1934961 God damn it!
1934963 1936127 Baby, hand me those matches.
1936129 1937563 I'm about to burn<br />this door down.
1937565 1938932 You're gonna light a fire
1938934 1940200 in a windowless room<br />that we're trapped in?
1940202 1941733 You slept with Bill Nye<br />the Science Guy.
1941735 1942801 He talked to you about flames?
1942803 1944071 What about that?
1958552 1960719 Where could he be?
1960721 1962755 His phone stopped<br />right here, huh?
1965592 1966994 - Hear that?<br />- Yeah.
1968628 1969828 Ugh.
1969830 1971163 Found it!
1971165 1972698 He must have known<br />we were tracking him.
1972700 1974336 Well, they outsmarted us.
1976537 1978270 Hang on.
1979273 1981140 Isn't that one of the actors?
1981142 1983709 Guess they're not<br />so smart after all, huh?
1983711 1987480 Guess not.<br />We are nailing this!
1987482 1989080 Why are we crouching?
1989082 1991152 I don't know. It feels right.
1994789 1996387 Oh, it's horrible in here.
1996389 1999558 Yeah, it's sticky.<br />Shoes are shot.
1999560 2000893 Ooh. There he is, there he is.
2000895 2001961 Don't let him see you.<br />Come on.
2001963 2003261 Sit down right here.
2003263 2005632 Bartender, sir,<br />can I ask you a question?
2005634 2006965 Um...
2006967 2008400 You, um...
2008402 2010737 You didn't happen to see<br />a fellow brought in here,
2010739 2012005 looks a little bit like me,
2012007 2014440 but he's got a little bit<br />of a sharper chin
2014442 2015973 and higher cheekbones?
2015975 2017910 So, a better-looking guy?
2017912 2019978 No, well,<br />I wouldn't call it that.
2019980 2021583 I didn't see nothing.
2022983 2024616 - Oh, boy. You hear that?<br />- Huh. Yeah.
2024618 2026484 That double negative?<br />"Didn't see nothing"?
2026486 2027886 - It's a little forced, right?<br />- Yeah, I think he's in on it.
2027888 2029154 - 'Course he is.<br />- Look at those tats.
2029156 2031624 So fresh, probably fake.
2031626 2033992 Tell you what.<br />Let's give him a test, okay?
2033994 2035426 Let's order a couple of drinks
2035428 2036929 that only a real bartender<br />would know how to make.
2036931 2038130 - Right?<br />- Oh! Smart! Yes.
2038132 2039464 - Sir! Excuse me. Hi.<br />- Barkeep.
2039466 2041032 Totally forgot<br />to order drinks.
2041034 2043035 Yes, uh...
2043037 2046074 Could I please have<br />a vodka tonic?
2047607 2048840 Well done, honey.
2048842 2051142 I'm gonna have<br />a Harvey Wallbanger.
2051144 2053879 Okay? Appreciate it.
2053881 2055381 Jesus! Did you see that look?
2055383 2056682 Guy doesn't know<br />what's going on.
2056684 2057850 Think you stumped him.
2057852 2059584 Some regional theater hack.
2059586 2061486 Huh?
2061488 2064288 - Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?<br />- Yeah.
2064290 2066292 It's nice<br />to get out of the house.
2066294 2068560 You know, we're not gonna be able to<br />do stuff like this if we have kids.
2068562 2069528 - What?<br />- Yeah.
2069530 2071129 - Why not?<br />- Well, I don't know.
2071131 2072631 I was thinking about it.<br />Remember Dan and Linda?
2072633 2074433 Remember how much time<br />we used to spend with them?
2074435 2077336 Just tons of fun, and then<br />they had those twins.
2077338 2079104 Boom! Off the grid, right?
2079106 2080538 Last time we saw them
2080540 2082375 was their Christmas card<br />with the wonky kids on it.
2082377 2085711 Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.<br />They look so happy.
2085713 2087013 But you know what I mean.
2087015 2088650 - We don't see 'em.<br />- Vodka tonic.
2089751 2091283 Harvey Wallbanger.
2091285 2092651 - Appreciate it.<br />- Thank you.
2092653 2094222 Cheers.
2097057 2098557 - Did he get it right?<br />- Huh.
2098559 2100493 I do not know. I realized I've<br />never had one of these,
2100495 2103029 but that is a tasty drink.<br />It's kind of tart.
2103031 2104830 You wanna try it?<br />Oh! Honey!
2104832 2106232 Honey! There's Brooks!
2106234 2107767 Brooks is here.<br />Brooks is here.
2107769 2109167 We're about to win this thing!
2109169 2111236 - Yes, yes!<br />- Look who came in here.
2111238 2113439 Oh! No! I think he made us.
2113441 2115741 So what? It's over. What, are<br />they gonna try to stop us?
2115743 2117176 - Let's go.<br />- Yeah, probably.
2117178 2120011 But that's why I brought this.
2120013 2121647 Jesus Christ, honey!<br />Where did you get a gun?
2121649 2124250 No, no, that's the fake gun<br />from Brooks' fight.
2124252 2125651 Oh, yeah.<br />Boy, that looks real.
2125653 2127053 - Yeah, well, you know...<br />- Look at that.
2127055 2128520 Brooks never spares<br />any expense.
2128522 2130555 - Yeah, that's true.<br />- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?
2130557 2132323 - Why, what are you doing?<br />- Lead?
2132325 2135194 Any of you<br />fucking pricks move,
2135196 2139131 and I'll execute every<br />motherfucking last one of you!
2139133 2140533 Very nice, honey.
2140535 2142500 Pulp Fiction, anybody?<br />Right? It's a classic.
2142502 2143535 We love films.
2143537 2145203 Okay, what the fuck<br />is this shit?
2145205 2146471 Well, you're gonna<br />hand over the keys
2146473 2148006 'cause we're gonna take<br />my brother.
2148008 2149941 - Bullshit.<br />- Oh, you know what's bullshit
2149943 2151778 is your bald, ugly face.
2151780 2153111 Uh-uh. No, that's personal.
2153113 2154846 Come on, honey,<br />let's just keep it fun.
2154848 2156582 All right, I'm sorry I called<br />you bald, you little bitch!
2156584 2158250 Well, that's,<br />again, you know...
2158252 2159519 - Let the gun do the talking.<br />- Okay.
2159521 2160886 - Come on.<br />- Ah!
2160888 2163154 On your knees. Hands in<br />the air. Heads on the ground.
2163156 2164357 - Good. Good. Great.<br />- Eyes closed.
2164359 2165658 That's it.<br />Get 'em up, reach for it.
2165660 2167359 - Hands up! That's right.<br />- There we go.
2167361 2169361 - All right, hands in the air!<br />- Get 'em up!
2169363 2171029 - Yep.<br />- Yo, where's my head go?
2171031 2172497 - Down.<br />- On the floor.
2172499 2173698 Just rest it.
2173700 2175334 How am I supposed<br />to put my hands in the air
2175336 2176368 - with my head on the ground?<br />- Fucking exactly.
2176370 2178069 I did have the same question.
2179473 2182040 Child's pose?<br />Do you guys know child's pose?
2182042 2183174 Fuck is a child's pose, man?
2183176 2184308 You've never done yoga?
2184310 2186812 - Okay, wow.<br />- No?
2186814 2188147 - Cover me.<br />- Show 'em, baby.
2188149 2189647 - All right. Arms out.<br />- Here she comes.
2189649 2191616 Knees apart if you have<br />back problems.
2191618 2193486 And if you're<br />doing it right,
2193488 2195787 you're really gonna feel that<br />lumbar opening up back there.
2195789 2197423 Let's put your head down.
2197425 2200125 Come on. I don't wanna have<br />to use this. Okay?
2200127 2202227 Okay.
2202229 2203495 Can't you just tell me<br />who it was?
2203497 2205229 I know you, Kev.<br />If I tell you,
2205231 2206933 you'll just obsess<br />about it even more.
2206935 2208401 Okay, fine. How about this?
2208403 2210602 If I guess it right,<br />you tell me.
2210604 2211671 Fine.
2211673 2212738 Was it an actor?
2212740 2214105 Yes. That tower is unstable.
2214107 2216475 I'm not stable!<br />Was he over 40?
2216477 2217743 Yes. Be careful.
2217745 2219845 Okay. American?
2219847 2221115 Yes.
2223017 2225149 It's Tommy Lee Jones.
2225151 2226687 What? Ew. No.
2228254 2231055 Denzel? Was it Denzel?<br />Denzel Washington?
2231057 2233158 It wasn't, unfortunately.
2233160 2235060 Thank God.
2235062 2236895 Um... Be careful.
2236897 2239298 Oh! Sweet freedom.
2239300 2240966 Oh, my...
2240968 2243201 You see, this dumbass thought<br />he can keep us locked in here.
2243203 2246238 But guess what?<br />You can't lock us in here!
2246240 2248540 You see, hate put us in here!
2248542 2249408 Okay, baby.
2249410 2250942 But love is gonna bust us out!
2250944 2252479 Oh, my God!
2254716 2255881 Oh, my God!
2255883 2257350 Kev... Kev, are you okay?
2257352 2259220 Baby, I fell down.
2267562 2269395 There it is.
2269397 2273131 Yes, I'm so glad<br />I invited you tonight!
2273133 2274600 Yeah, me too.
2274602 2276267 I usually bring these girls<br />I wanna sleep with,
2276269 2277636 and they just suck!
2277638 2280272 You're like<br />a breath of fresh air.
2280274 2282006 Aw, thanks.
2282008 2283174 I usually go out with men
2283176 2284377 I find interesting<br />and non-stupid,
2284379 2285877 so this is a bit new<br />for me, too.
2285879 2287082 Whoa!
2287682 2288546 Are we cool?
2288548 2290482 Did I say something wrong?
2290484 2291917 No.
2291919 2294319 No, I mean I was wondering why<br />you asked me along tonight,
2294321 2296689 and now I know you<br />just needed a ringer, so...
2296691 2297823 Oh, did you...
2297825 2299558 You thought this was a date?<br />I didn't...
2299560 2303462 No, actually.<br />Well, I was hoping it wasn't.
2303464 2305230 Then why are you<br />wearing lipstick?
2305232 2306732 - I'm not.<br />- Yeah, you are.
2306734 2308066 What are you...
2308068 2309600 You can't touch<br />a girl's mouth.
2309602 2311270 Why? Are you scared I'm<br />gonna smear your lipstick...
2311272 2313138 Oh, my God! You bit me!
2313140 2314238 Yeah, and I'll bite you again.
2314240 2315341 There's lipstick on here.
2315343 2316941 Oh, shut up!
2316943 2319078 I see you wiping off<br />that date lipstick!
2321149 2322214 Ow!
2322216 2324452 That really hurt a little bit.
2325653 2327118 Hello?
2327120 2329187 Hello?
2336030 2337432 Um, excuse me?
2342368 2344171 Yeah, okay.
2344738 2345805 Um...
2345807 2346808 Hello?
2350510 2352746 Oh, oh! Oh, shit!
2355381 2356650 Holy shit!
2357385 2358817 My God!
2358819 2360551 Come on! Bloody hell!
2360553 2362087 - What?<br />- Phew!
2362089 2365390 You guys scared me so bad.<br />What are you doing?
2365392 2366959 What the fuck is that?
2366961 2370062 Oh. Well, I just came from<br />a six-hour murder mystery
2370064 2371662 where I played the corpse.
2371664 2373665 I must have dozed off before<br />I had a chance to clean up.
2373667 2376134 Well, you scared<br />the shit out of us.
2376136 2377602 Really? Thank you.
2377604 2379337 Actually that means a lot<br />'cause I do my own makeup.
2379339 2381774 What kind of party<br />has a pregnant corpse?
2381776 2384042 No, I'm actually pregnant,<br />this isn't part of it.
2384044 2385111 This is just...
2385113 2386278 Oh!
2386280 2387312 - Congrats.<br />- Thank you!
2388716 2390982 Um, we want you<br />to give us the final clue
2390984 2394419 to the murder mystery<br />Brooks Davis ordered.
2394421 2396488 Oh, my gosh.<br />But that would ruin the fun.
2396490 2399524 We don't want the fun.<br />We just wanna win.
2399526 2401660 Yeah, I can't do that.
2412439 2414676 This change your mind?
2419647 2420782 No.
2422115 2423816 Don't...
2423818 2425953 What about this?
2434127 2435330 Mmm.
2436464 2437995 You drive a hard bargain.<br />Okay.
2437997 2440467 Let's take it up a notch.
2453481 2455881 I was hoping I wasn't<br />gonna have to dig this deep,
2455883 2457716 but okay.
2457718 2459787 Final offer.
2466227 2467658 You know what?<br />It doesn't matter
2467660 2469962 how slowly you slide it over!
2469964 2472564 Okay? It's $17!<br />How much do you want?
2472566 2474366 Um, I don't know.<br />Probably 100.
2474368 2475500 Give her 100.
2475502 2477305 I don't have 100.
2478138 2480308 How much have you got?
2480975 2484575 - $17.<br />- $17?
2484577 2486546 You brought $17 out?
2489082 2491116 Nice!
2491118 2492417 - Thank you!<br />- Cool.
2492419 2494953 Oh! So you're just<br />gonna keep it. I gotcha.
2494955 2496955 Stay back!
2496957 2498323 Hey, buddy,<br />can you just give us
2498325 2499424 the answer<br />to the second riddle
2499426 2500526 'cause we're way behind.
2500528 2501794 Don't you get it?
2501796 2503462 That was not<br />supposed to happen.
2505231 2507933 Oh, what now? You guys already<br />did the breaking-in thing.
2507935 2510435 Shut up! And get on the floor,<br />all of you!
2510437 2513939 Whoa! Ron, you okay?
2513941 2515906 No, Nathan, I'm not okay.
2515908 2518544 Two guys came in here<br />and attacked me.
2518546 2520379 - Oh, my God.<br />- I know!
2520381 2523082 And I quit Disney Cruises<br />for this bullshit.
2523084 2525250 "Look in your jacket pocket."
2525252 2527252 We can check, but that<br />doesn't make any sense.
2527254 2528553 I'm not wearing a jacket.
2528555 2531223 Maybe it means a,<br />like a book jacket.
2531225 2533591 Why would a book<br />have a jacket?
2535796 2536928 Murder We Wrote.
2536930 2538729 Glenda, something terrible<br />has happened.
2538731 2540564 - What?<br />- Nathan and I showed up for the take away,
2540566 2542468 and Ron had been attacked.
2542470 2545069 - Where? At the Brooks Davis house?<br />- Yes.
2545071 2546340 - Huh?<br />- What?
2547207 2548741 Is everyone okay?
2548743 2550642 No, no.<br />I'm not okay, Glenda!
2550644 2554245 I have a throbbing headache,<br />and they took the host!
2554247 2555913 - Who took him?<br />- Kidnappers!

2630323 2632189 Listen, I'm not a venture<br />capitalist. I'm a smuggler!
2632191 2633459 A smuggler?
2633461 2634892 Yeah,<br />I made a mistake.
2634894 2636495 I sold The Bulgarian's egg<br />to a different guy.
2636497 2638196 And I have to get it back<br />to him, or he's gonna kill me!
2638198 2639598 "The Bulgarian's egg"?
2639600 2641098 Wasn't that the third<br />Harry Potter book?
2641100 2642267 Wait, I'm confused.
2642269 2643567 So this isn't the end<br />of this whole thing?
2643569 2644970 No, it is the end, okay?
2644972 2646770 You said, whoever catches you<br />gets the car.
2646772 2649040 We found you, we get the car.<br />Game over.
2649042 2651276 No! I'm telling you!<br />This is all real!
2651278 2652977 The shitty actors<br />are real? Come on.
2652979 2655279 How about that ridiculous<br />fight? Was that real?
2655281 2656580 Is this gun real?
2656582 2657716 Oh, no, Annie!
2657718 2660151 Oh, no. Oh, no.<br />Bang, bang.
2662122 2663124 Ow!
2671865 2672763 Blood!
2672765 2675566 Oh, my God! I shot you!
2675568 2677002 You fucking shot me!
2677004 2679104 Cut me loose<br />before we all get shot!
2679106 2680037 Come on, untie me!
2680039 2681372 - Get me out of here!<br />- Oh, God!
2683109 2684475 Help me. Help!

2688314 2690415 - Come on, come on, come on.<br />- God damn it!
2690417 2691750 - Hey!<br />- Where are the guns?
2691752 2693087 - Here, here!<br />- Go!
2694455 2695587 You shot me.
2695589 2697154 I know, I feel terrible.
2697156 2698589 - Come on, man!<br />- Go! Go, go!
2698591 2699658 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2699660 2701091 Come on, bitch!
2701093 2702660 - Oh, my God!<br />- Move your ass!
2702662 2704328 - Honey, get in!<br />- Go, go!
2704330 2705732 Go, go, go!
2706732 2708568 Holy shit!
2709569 2712872 Hold up!<br />Hold up, motherfucker!
2713807 2716042 - God damn it!<br />- Man, come on!
2717611 2720044 Brooks, what the fuck is going<br />on with you? Start talking!
2720046 2722546 I've lied to you and<br />the family about what I do.
2722548 2724582 I buy and I sell illegal shit
2724584 2725750 for people<br />on the black market.
2725752 2726984 Really?<br />So you're a criminal?
2726986 2728222 Oh, my God!<br />They're following us!
2729856 2731490 But I made a mistake<br />because there's this guy,
2731492 2733091 they call him The Bulgarian.
2733093 2734926 He's got his fingers in all<br />these pies around the world.
2734928 2736928 - What kind of pies?<br />- Illegal pies, Max.
2736930 2738662 You know, the kind of pies<br />that have heroin in 'em
2738664 2739830 and guns and sex slaves.
2739832 2741433 You know,<br />all that kind of stuff.
2741435 2743734 But he just wanted me to help<br />him find this Faberge egg.
2743736 2746104 Fuck that! Faberge egg?
2746106 2747805 - Are you kidding me?<br />- No, I'm serious.
2747807 2749441 And I found it!
2749443 2751442 But then there was this other<br />guy, this Marlon Freeman.
2751444 2753444 He's willing to pay twice<br />as much for the same egg.
2753446 2755214 So what? So you screwed over<br />the Bulgarian guy,
2755216 2757015 and those fellows behind us<br />work for him,
2757017 2758383 and they just happen to crash<br />your murder mystery party?
2758385 2762187 I know, right?<br />What are the odds of that?
2762189 2763857 - Oh, too close, too close!<br />- Careful, careful!
2765792 2767225 Watch out! Watch out!
2767227 2768229 Oh, oh!
2770698 2772096 - Shit!<br />- Sorry! You okay?
2772098 2773397 - Yeah, I'm all right.<br />- Okay.
2773399 2774633 We need to go to the cops now!
2774635 2775868 - Yeah, right now! Let's go!<br />- No!
2775870 2777136 - We can't go to the cops!<br />- Why?
2777138 2778636 The Bulgarian's got<br />a ton of moles.
2778638 2779906 On his face?
2781475 2783042 No, in the police department.
2783044 2784312 Look out!
2785611 2787113 Careful!
2791584 2793119 Oh, my God!<br />This is insane!
2807267 2809567 If you call the cops, I'll be<br />dead before I get to jail.
2809569 2811502 Why don't we just get a hold<br />of this Marlon Freeman guy
2811504 2813270 and buy the egg back from him?
2813272 2814908 I couldn't find him if I wanted to.<br />That name's an alias.
2818711 2820013 - Gun, gun, gun! Duck!<br />- Oh, oh...
2830256 2832424 Okay, these guys are not<br />stopping. What do we do?
2832426 2835826 They're not gonna stop<br />until they get me.
2835828 2838662 I'm sorry I dragged<br />you guys into this.
2838664 2841034 I'm sorry for a lot of things.
2843269 2845105 - Hey! What are you doing?<br />- What is he doing?
2846372 2848740 - I love you, Max!<br />- Brooks, don't be an idiot!
2851010 2852213 Stop the car!
2860821 2863391 - Shit! Go, go, go!<br />- Okay, okay, okay!
2866560 2868959 Fuck! What are we gonna do?<br />They're gonna kill my brother.
2868961 2870828 Oh, Annie, I feel faint.<br />I'm gonna pass out.
2870830 2872796 Oh, honey, we'll get you<br />to a hospital, okay?
2872798 2874165 No, no, no! No hospitals.
2874167 2875633 This is a gunshot wound,<br />they'll call the cops.
2875635 2876801 Shit, shit! Okay.
2876803 2880171 So, we go<br />to a mob doctor, right?
2880173 2881772 Do you know one of those,<br />sweetheart?
2881774 2883274 - No.<br />- No.
2883276 2885877 What about a veterinarian<br />that works for the mob?
2885879 2887578 - You know one of those?<br />- No.
2887580 2889214 Come on. Why are you pitching<br />all the mob stuff?
2889216 2890549 Because I'm losing<br />my shit here!
2890551 2891649 I get it.
2891651 2892783 You're gonna have to do it.
2892785 2894086 - What?<br />- Yup.
2894088 2895319 You're gonna have<br />to take the bullet out.
2895321 2896520 I don't wanna do it.
2896522 2897855 You think I want you<br />to take the bullet out?
2897857 2898890 I've seen you try<br />to cut a chicken.
2898892 2900225 We have no other option.
2900227 2902694 Oh, my God!<br />This is so bad!
2902696 2904331 I hate game night!
2907700 2909836 Thank you!
2910569 2911970 Hey!
2911972 2913470 Oh, thank God. Listen, Annie.<br />It's all real.
2913472 2914805 Oh, no, I know.
2914807 2916506 Brooks is caught up<br />in something and...
2916508 2918008 Okay, where are you guys?
2918010 2919410 We're all at Brooks's.<br />We need to talk to the cops.
2919412 2921814 No! No, no, no!<br />Do not talk to the cops!
2921816 2923048 What? Why? What's going on?
2923050 2924482 - Are you guys okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2924484 2926819 We're fine, we're fine.<br />I shot Max, but he's fine.
2926821 2928153 What?
2928155 2929520 Look. We will meet you<br />back at our house.
2929522 2931189 Whatever you do,<br />do not tell the cops anything.
2931191 2933493 Brooks's life depends on it.
2938365 2939832 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2939834 2941066 Okay.
2941068 2942433 I got a bunch of stuff.
2942435 2944002 Yeah.
2944004 2946037 Pocket knife. Tweezers.
2946039 2947406 Sewing kit. Gauze.
2947408 2949174 Good, good. All right.<br />Wow, you did great!
2949176 2951776 Yeah. And they didn't<br />have rubbing alcohol.
2951778 2953176 And they don't sell<br />hard liquor,
2953178 2954812 so I got you<br />this lovely Chard.
2954814 2957048 Good idea.<br />Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.
2957050 2959383 What else did you get?<br />More good stuff?
2959385 2961852 What is helpful in<br />Country Living?
2961854 2963421 Oh, that's for later.
2963423 2965656 There's a corn chowder recipe<br />that looks really good.
2965658 2967926 - You love corn chowder, huh?<br />- Sweet. I do, yeah.
2967928 2968993 - That'll cheer you up.<br />- Thank you.
2968995 2970462 Okay. And then, a squeaky toy.
2970464 2972062 - Huh.<br />- For your mouth.
2972064 2973397 - For the pain.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2973399 2975000 Okay. Well, hopefully<br />I won't need this.
2975002 2977002 - Okay, let's see this bad boy.<br />- All right.
2977004 2978203 Yeah, careful.
2978205 2979904 - Okay.<br />- All right.
2981006 2982439 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
2982441 2984075 - We're gonna push past it.<br />- No problem. No problem.
2984077 2985377 - We'll get the bullet out.<br />- Let's just google.
2985379 2987011 Honey, can you return<br />the text later?
2987013 2987879 This is instructions<br />on how to remove a bullet.
2987881 2989046 Oh, sorry.
2989048 2990381 It's an alt-right<br />militia website,
2990383 2992283 so I'm just gonna ignore<br />the racist stuff.
2992285 2993618 - Good. Good, good.<br />- Yeah?
2993620 2995520 Okay. "Step one,<br />sterile gloves."
2995522 2996788 Check!
2996790 2998089 We're doing<br />the best we can, right?
2998091 2999857 Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.
2999859 3001225 "Step two."
3001227 3004263 Um... Okay.<br />"Disinfect wound."
3004265 3006564 Right, yeah.<br />That's gonna sting, isn't it?
3006566 3007765 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
3007767 3009332 - Let's do it.<br />- Okay?
3011071 3013571 That smarts, huh?
3013573 3015173 Yeah.
3015175 3017508 Gonna administer anesthetic.
3017510 3018442 We don't have that.
3018444 3020044 Just gonna skip that one.<br />Okay.
3020046 3021345 "Step four, apply pressure<br />above the wound."
3021347 3023381 Here, you squeeze that there.
3023383 3024982 - I got it.<br />- Great. Thank you.
3024984 3027285 We're just gonna make<br />two tiny incisions...
3027287 3028218 Oh, my God.
3028220 3029421 On either side<br />of the wound.
3029423 3031423 Easy-peasy.
3031425 3032656 This is fun, huh?
3032658 3034424 - Are you having fun?<br />- No.
3034426 3035926 - Let's get the bullet.<br />- Okay. Here we go.
3035928 3037229 Let's get in there and get it.
3037231 3038863 Nice and small,<br />nice and small, baby.
3038865 3040564 Okay. Yeah, yeah. Tiny, teeny.
3044171 3046738 That's not small.<br />That's really big!
3046740 3048272 So big?
3048274 3049941 Way too big, baby. It's<br />a bullet, not a grapefruit.
3049943 3052176 I'm sorry! I'm sorry. This is<br />my first time. I don't know...
3052178 3053879 Oh, there's so much blood.
3055149 3056814 No, no.<br />Don't you start doing that.
3056816 3058450 No, you're gonna make...
3061321 3062687 - I'm sorry.<br />- Stop it.
3062689 3064288 I'm looking at you<br />and you're making me...
3064290 3065689 Well, don't look at me.<br />I won't look at it.
3065691 3067691 - Push through. Let's go.<br />- Okay. All right, okay.
3067693 3069227 - No more cutting.<br />- Oh, shit.
3069229 3070160 Just get the tweezers<br />and get the bullet out, baby.
3070162 3071162 Shit, shit, shit. Um...
3071164 3072229 What? What happened?
3072231 3073497 Phone went to sleep.
3073499 3075100 You gotta set it<br />so that thing stays on.
3075102 3076368 - No. My phone doesn't do that.<br />- Sure it does.
3076370 3078169 Same phone as mine.<br />Just change it.
3078171 3079638 Just gonna touch it with my nose<br />every 30 seconds. It's fine.
3079640 3080872 Don't be afraid of your phone.
3080874 3082140 Get in there,<br />go to the settings,
3082142 3083408 go to display<br />and change the timing
3083410 3084442 so that it doesn't revert<br />to sleep mode.
3084444 3085743 - Revert?<br />- Yeah.
3085745 3087278 What are you, Steve Jobs?<br />I'm not reverting anything.
3087280 3088212 I'm just not afraid<br />of my phone, honey.
3088214 3089546 It's so fucking simple.
3089548 3091415 Shh! Quiet.<br />I know what I'm doing, okay?
3091417 3092649 Do you?
3092651 3093817 Yes.
3093819 3095819 - Here she goes.<br />- Here we go.
3095821 3097120 You're like a dolphin.
3097122 3099156 All right.<br />This part's gonna hurt.
3099158 3100625 I don't... I don't doubt it.
3100627 3101825 Okay, let's do this.
3101827 3103294 Okay.
3104365 3105863 Ooh... Oh, wait.
3105865 3107732 What is that?
3107734 3109000 You hear that?
3109002 3110502 What's that sound?<br />What's that sound?
3110504 3111535 Is that the bullet?
3111537 3114171 - That's bone!<br />- What?
3114173 3115906 That's not right.
3115908 3119877 Okay. What do the racists say<br />if you can't find the bullet?
3119879 3121379 Yeah, that's bone.<br />You got the bone.
3121381 3123515 I'm looking at my bone.<br />Look right here.
3123517 3126986 Max,<br />did you get shot twice?
3129955 3131522 That's the exit wound.
3131524 3133091 Oh, it came out!
3133093 3134892 Yup. Nothing to remove.
3134894 3136227 The bullet has exited the arm.
3136229 3138029 Well, let's just sew<br />that sucker up, huh?
3138031 3139332 Yeah.
3140499 3143301 No, no. Honey, don't,<br />don't look at...
3143303 3144636 Stop it.
3146972 3148205 I'm sorry.
3148207 3149807 Now, the Bulgarian's guys<br />have Brooks,
3149809 3151276 and the only way<br />to save him
3151278 3152977 is to get that egg from this<br />Marlon Freeman guy.
3152979 3155747 I can't believe your brother's<br />been lying to us this whole time.
3155749 3157381 He's even cooler<br />than we thought.
3157383 3159785 Honey, I think you sewed<br />my arm to my sleeve.
3159787 3162187 I didn't even know Morgan<br />Freeman collected Faberge eggs.
3162189 3164089 Aren't those worth<br />millions of dollars?
3164091 3165924 It's Marlon Freeman,<br />but that's just an alias.
3165926 3168258 Somehow, we gotta find out his<br />real name, find out his address.
3168260 3170394 - Police computer.<br />- What do you mean?
3170396 3172662 I once dated this girl<br />whose father was a cop.
3172664 3174566 She showed me<br />her dad's police computer.
3174568 3177468 It has a database with<br />every known alias on it.
3177470 3180171 I bet we could find Marlon<br />Wayans' real name on it.
3180173 3181540 So, if we called her up,
3181542 3183006 would she let you go<br />on her dad's computer?
3183008 3185542 No. No way! That ended badly.
3185544 3187345 So, how are we gonna get into<br />a police computer
3187347 3188546 without the cops knowing?
3188548 3189781 - Billy Bob Thornton!<br />- What?
3189783 3191149 - What?<br />- You slept with
3191151 3193384 - Billy Bob, didn't you?<br />- Hang on, hang on!
3193386 3195722 I know where we can<br />get on a police computer.
3197356 3200091 - Hey!<br />- Gary!
3200093 3202026 Goodness.
3202028 3204194 To what do Bastian and I<br />owe the pleasure?
3204196 3205729 Well, we were<br />all just talking,
3205731 3208566 and we realized we haven't had<br />a game night in ages.
3208568 3211269 - Just the seven of us.<br />- So...
3211271 3213238 I thought you were going<br />to your brother's house.
3213240 3214705 I never said that.
3214707 3216674 Come on, Gare Bear. Live<br />a little! It's the weekend!
3216676 3218743 We were just saying how you<br />were always better at games
3218745 3220111 than Debbie was.
3220113 3222747 I'll thank you<br />not to besmirch my ex-wife.
3222749 3224216 That woman is an angel.
3224218 3228754 Oh. Yeah, she was much better<br />at games than you.
3228756 3235162 I will admit I have eagerly<br />awaited a visit such as this.
3241167 3242933 Where'd he go?
3242935 3244701 Do we follow him?
3244703 3245736 It seems like it.
3245738 3247640 - Ryan, you go first.<br />- I'm scared.
3253914 3256948 Help yourself to popped corn<br />with sea salt.
3256950 3259383 Oh! Oh!
3259385 3261551 Yummy, yummy.
3261553 3263220 I can't believe<br />that you read my mind.
3263222 3264522 I was craving popcorn.
3264524 3266957 You have a framed photo<br />of game night?
3266959 3268325 Doesn't everyone<br />have photographs
3268327 3270563 of their best friends<br />in their homes?
3272131 3275133 Of course. We do.
3275135 3277000 Max, you wanna go first?
3277002 3279069 Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.
3279071 3280537 Oh. There's a loose one.
3280539 3283207 Always in the middle.<br />That's where you wanna go.
3283209 3284741 Can I use your john<br />real quick?
3284743 3287213 Of course. It's the end<br />of the hall, next to our...
3290651 3292419 My bedroom.
3293854 3294855 Okay.
3317109 3318845 Oh, no, Gary.
3346606 3350875 So, Sarah, how long<br />have you two been a couple?
3350877 3353544 Oh, no! No, we're not.<br />We just...
3353546 3355513 We work together.<br />I wouldn't, um...
3355515 3356580 I wouldn't do that thing.
3356582 3359383 I see. I thought I detected
3359385 3362386 a certain chemistry<br />between the two of you.
3362388 3365423 No. No way.
3365425 3368158 - No, that's not...<br />- Mmm. Mmm.
3368160 3369426 Then again,<br />I'm not the best judge
3369428 3371930 of chemistry<br />in the world.
3379772 3381372 Hmm.
3381374 3383310 Oh, because<br />your wife left you.
3383943 3384944 Oh, shit.
3394521 3396856 Hello, Donald Anderton.
3405798 3407501 Oh!
3408401 3410767 So many possible moves.
3410769 3413239 I just don't know<br />where to begin.
3415073 3417741 Um, maybe... Ooh...
3417743 3419144 - Decision-making.<br />- Come on, Annie.
3419146 3420076 Just make up your mind.<br />Please.
3420078 3421281 - No!<br />- No?
3423383 3426520 Yup, take your time.
3458084 3461622 Oh, Brooks. What have you<br />gotten yourself into?
3478703 3483707 Oh, shit. Where did you<br />come from, little guy?
3483709 3488011 Son of a bitch.<br />Hey! What are you, a vampire?
3488013 3490716 Oh, God. Oh, God.
3493419 3496854 Oh, my God.<br />Has that got it?
3496856 3501394 No, that doesn't got it.<br />God damn it. Come on!
3505263 3506466 No!
3508267 3509500 I should go check on him.
3509502 3510901 I think he's fine.
3510903 3514040 - He cried out.<br />- Tell me about Debbie.
3517010 3518875 I beg your pardon.
3518877 3520076 Oh, just, I...
3520078 3523482 I never met her. I'd love<br />to hear all about her.
3534227 3535727 Where do I begin?
3535729 3537194 All right,<br />you wanna take a bath?
3537196 3538529 We'll take a little bath.
3538531 3543570 There we go. Okay.<br />All right. Here we go.
3545571 3548742 There we go, huh? Huh?
3550010 3551709 Oh, it's so much worse.
3551711 3553778 Oh, God.<br />And what did I do to this?
3553780 3555482 What the fuck is this thing?
3556883 3558049 Oh, Debbie.
3558051 3559553 Oh!
3566892 3569694 Okay. Fuck this.
3569696 3571629 Hey, guys, Gary was right.<br />It's awful late.
3571631 3573029 Let's get home,<br />get to bed, huh?
3573031 3574332 Get out of his hair.
3574334 3576366 We haven't finished the game.<br />It's your turn, Max.
3576368 3577769 Oh, my turn, huh?
3577771 3580404 Okay, be careful now, Max.<br />Oh!
3580406 3582339 Well, game over.<br />I went in a little hot.
3582341 3583441 Why did you...
3583443 3585408 Thanks.<br />Good to see you, Gary.
3585410 3587745 When shall we play next?
3587747 3590684 Soon.<br />We'll call you.
3595555 3598589 Bastian. Baby!
3600026 3602392 So, how are we supposed<br />to get this egg
3602394 3604127 out of<br />Donald Anderton's house?
3604129 3606830 I don't know.<br />I'm gonna figure it out.
3606832 3609801 "Unknown Caller."<br />Please don't be Gary.
3609803 3610935 Hello?
3610937 3612806 We have your brother.
3613339 3614471 Um...
3614473 3615906 Okay. We know<br />where the egg is,
3615908 3617341 and we're actually<br />on our way there right now.
3617343 3618942 We can do a swap, okay?<br />Please don't hurt Brooks.
3618944 3620845 Meet us on the East<br />4th Street bridge
3620847 3622879 at midnight.<br />If you're late, he dies.
3622881 3624883 - Oh, my God.<br />- Um...
3624885 3627988 Boy, that's less than<br />an hour from now.
3629055 3630053 Hello?
3630055 3631754 What's up<br />with this guy's voice?
3631756 3633558 He sounds like a monster.
3633560 3635225 He's using<br />a voice changer, Ryan.
3635227 3637897 He still sounds like<br />a scary monster.
3641100 3645435 And we are here.
3645437 3646904 All right, you guys head home,
3646906 3648339 and I will call as soon as<br />I get the egg, all right?
3648341 3650040 What? Wait a second, wait.<br />I'm going with you.
3650042 3652142 No, Annie. It could be very<br />dangerous in there, okay?
3652144 3653778 Listen, you know,<br />Brooks shouldn't have dragged
3653780 3655412 any of us into this,<br />but he is my brother.
3655414 3656781 And it's up to me to fix it.
3656783 3658082 No, bullshit!<br />We're all in this together!
3658084 3659783 - Ryan!<br />- No, no. No. Max is right.
3659785 3662986 You guys should go home,<br />but you and I are doing this.
3662988 3665223 Okay, what happens<br />if you guys don't make it out?
3665225 3666857 We don't come<br />to game night
3666859 3668024 because we're dying to play<br />Charades and shit.
3668026 3669627 We come because<br />we love you guys.
3669629 3671261 Honestly, this is<br />the best part of our week.
3671263 3674099 Mine, too. And I have a lot<br />of options on the weekend.
3674935 3676801 Wow. You guys...
3676803 3679136 Thank you. That's very nice.
3679138 3681973 Aw, good friends.
3681975 3683741 You should probably go,<br />though, right?
3683743 3685676 I mean,<br />you don't even know us.
3685678 3687278 Yeah, why are you still here?
3687280 3691549 Oh. I don't know.<br />I just got caught up in it.
3691551 3693183 Also, if I go home now,<br />and then I read
3693185 3694884 in the newspaper tomorrow<br />that you all died,
3694886 3698492 I'll feel shit that I left,<br />so I'm gonna stick around.
3699492 3701691 You still read the newspaper?
3701693 3703593 That's what you got from that?
3703595 3705164 How are we gonna<br />get into this place?
3707432 3709668 Go! Go! Go! Go!
3716276 3718810 Okay.
3718812 3720676 Looks like they got<br />a party going on.
3720678 3721947 This could be good.
3733959 3736729 Where is everybody?
3752245 3753647 No way!
3761854 3764287 It's some kind of<br />rich guy's fight club.
3764289 3767159 I knew it. They are real.
3771062 3772131 Come on!
3783443 3787477 That's my Boomer!<br />That's my Boomer!
3787479 3790214 Man, this is some<br />Django Unchained bullshit.
3790216 3791881 Water!
3791883 3794984 That's my boy!<br />Good boy! Good boy!
3794986 3797453 Rich people are fucked up!
3797455 3799723 Kramer, get Logan ready!
3799725 3802725 Okay, minimum buy-in<br />is now 10 grand.
3802727 3804160 Okay, I think<br />we should split up.
3804162 3805863 Yeah.<br />And let's start upstairs.
3805865 3807397 Anybody finds the egg,<br />just text the others, okay?
3807399 3809566 And for God's sake, be careful<br />with it. All right?
3809568 3811870 - Gotcha. I got it.<br />- Be safe.
3813305 3815173 What are you...<br />What are you doing?
3815175 3817374 Who says the egg<br />isn't in here?
3817376 3820343 Also, I have a really good<br />feeling about Logan.
3820345 3823881 Egg, egg, egg.<br />Wow! This is some bedroom.
3823883 3825616 Does it remind you<br />of your celebrity boyfriend's?
3825618 3826850 Are you still on this?
3826852 3828486 Yes, I'm still on this,<br />Michelle.
3828488 3829787 That's all I can think about.
3829789 3831421 And that's saying a lot,<br />considering we got
3831423 3833924 Eyes Wide Fight Club<br />going on downstairs.
3833926 3835892 Why is this<br />so important to you?
3835894 3837560 Because, Michelle, look,
3837562 3839696 I am losing my mind here.<br />Okay?
3839698 3841064 We were broken up at the time.
3841066 3842765 I got a hand job<br />from Karen Waller,
3842767 3844868 so you had every right to.
3844870 3846306 So, why not just tell me?
3848240 3850275 Okay, fine.
3851943 3853609 It was 10 years ago.
3853611 3855011 I was at a gas station,
3855013 3857416 and I noticed a guy<br />at the next pump.
3859084 3863120 It was Denzel Washington.
3863122 3864324 Hold up.
3865725 3868191 It actually was Denzel?
3868193 3869261 Yeah.
3873298 3874964 He was really nice.
3874966 3877000 He made some joke<br />about how premium gas
3877002 3878836 is probably the same<br />as regular.
3878838 3880069 I took a chance,<br />and I asked him
3880071 3881571 if he wanted to get drinks.
3881573 3883441 He said yes.
3883443 3884875 We both got a little tipsy.
3884877 3886910 I offered to pay for drinks,<br />and he let me,
3886912 3889115 which I thought<br />was pretty cool.
3889847 3892317 We danced for hours.
3894921 3896752 Eventually, we ended up<br />back at his place,
3896754 3899858 and one thing led to another.
3901294 3904361 It was just this crazy thing<br />that happened
3904363 3906363 and, in a weird way,<br />it made me realize
3906365 3910069 the only person<br />I ever wanna be with is you.
3911669 3913002 Nah.
3913004 3914772 Nah. I don't believe it.
3914774 3916307 - Oh, you...<br />- Mmm-mmm.
3916309 3918542 Well, I took a picture<br />with him at the club.
3918544 3920345 I put it in a hidden folder.
3921546 3922848 Denzel and Michelle.
3928488 3930187 Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.
3930189 3931055 Yeah, it is.
3931057 3932756 Mmm. No, it's not.
3932758 3935160 Dude looks<br />a lot like Denzel,
3935794 3937261 but it's not him.
3937263 3939296 You're crazy. That's...<br />Look at that, that's Denzel.
3939298 3941799 Okay, let me ask you this.<br />Did he say he was Denzel?
3941801 3943700 Well, no...
3943702 3946470 He tried to introduce himself,<br />and I cut him off
3946472 3949141 because I told him<br />I knew who he was.
3951310 3953644 - What kind of car did he drive?<br />- A BMW.
3953646 3955513 - Hmm.<br />- Three series.
3955515 3958549 Mmm. What was his place like?
3958551 3961054 It was a two-bedroom condo.
3962588 3967625 And he used the spare room<br />as an office, so...
3967627 3969426 Do you hear<br />what you're saying right now?
3969428 3972062 Hold on, let me see.
3972064 3974434 When you zoom in,<br />the nose gives it away, right?
3975533 3976866 - Goddamn!<br />- Mmm-hmm.
3976868 3978736 Look, don't beat yourself up<br />about it, okay?
3978738 3980370 There is some good news.
3980372 3982872 If you wanna get with Denzel,
3982874 3985109 he's standing right here!
3985111 3990013 Because the real<br />Denzel ain't got shit on me!
3992350 3996419 Honey, how does this monster<br />have five kids?
3996421 3998354 We don't get to have one.
3998356 4000790 Well, his wife looks like<br />she's about 15.
4000792 4004060 Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.
4004062 4006296 Right, right. No, I know,<br />honey. We're just gonna...
4006298 4010167 We're gonna keep plugging away<br />until something sticks, okay?
4010169 4013037 Gee, you really sound like a<br />guy who wants to have a kid.
4013039 4014337 Well, you know, I'm just...
4014339 4016173 I'm a little distracted<br />right now, honey,
4016175 4017674 as you might imagine.
4017676 4021745 Look, if you're not into this,<br />you kinda gotta tell me.
4021747 4023214 Listen.
4023216 4027683 I wanna have a baby, but<br />how do I explain this? Um...
4027685 4030654 Do you remember how we used to<br />play Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes
4030656 4032522 and we could play all night?
4032524 4034390 Do you remember this one time, I<br />made it all the way up to level 86,
4034392 4036292 - and you were not too far behind, right?<br />- 85, but...
4036294 4037662 And then I kicked your ass<br />at Galaga.
4037664 4039595 - So anyway, what is the point?<br />- Mmm... Anyway.
4039597 4041799 Do you remember<br />how we stayed alive so long?
4041801 4043667 All we did was<br />we ate the pellets.
4043669 4046839 We never ate the fruit because<br />the fruit is how they get you.
4048240 4049874 Oh, you're doing a metaphor!
4049876 4051441 Yes, but here's the problem.
4051443 4054078 No matter how long you and I<br />stayed alive in the game,
4054080 4056149 neither one of us ever made it<br />up to the leader board.
4057249 4059183 And you think<br />if we have a baby,
4059185 4060683 we'll be officially<br />settling down,
4060685 4063220 and you'll never make it<br />onto the leader board of life?
4063222 4064888 That's such a good metaphor.
4064890 4066055 Yeah, no, it's not.
4066057 4068191 - It's kind of bullshit.<br />- Why?
4068193 4069894 - What are we, 16 years old?<br />- No.
4069896 4073095 - You wanna go backpacking through Europe? Huh?<br />- Uh-uh.
4073097 4075098 You wanna, like,<br />have some wine coolers
4075100 4078368 on a football field<br />with Rebecca De Mornay?
4078370 4079602 Not specifically.
4079604 4082471 You know who's always gone<br />for the fruit, Max?
4082473 4084575 Your criminal brother,<br />and that is why
4084577 4086944 the ghosts<br />are about to eat him!
4086946 4088578 Look who's embracing<br />the metaphor.
4088580 4091415 I was so...<br />Wow. You know what?
4091417 4093250 All this time,<br />I've just been thinking
4093252 4095185 that if I helped you<br />beat Brooks,
4095187 4097053 you would be less stressed.
4097055 4098956 But you don't wanna<br />beat Brooks.
4098958 4101494 You wanna be Brooks.
4103095 4105431 I'm gonna look somewhere else.
4117508 4120344 Come on, Logan!<br />Boomer ain't shit!
4120346 4121644 Hey, ADHD!
4121646 4123315 We're supposed to be<br />looking for the...
4125885 4128588 Holy shit. I'm right again.
4130623 4132089 Wait, where are you going?
4132091 4133991 Everybody's watching the fight.<br />I'm gonna go grab it.
4133993 4137163 - No, don't fucking...<br />- Be cool, be cool.
4152377 4154580 Oh, shit!
4157716 4158718 Who the hell are you?
4159752 4160885 Me?
4160887 4162986 Yeah. Who are you?
4162988 4164721 And what are you doing<br />with my egg?
4164723 4166689 Oh. I was just admiring it.
4166691 4169193 I got a bunch of these<br />fancy-pants eggs
4169195 4171362 back at home. In my mansion.
4171364 4174167 - Uh-huh.<br />- This one's ugly. Hmm.
4175068 4176633 Does anybody know this guy?
4176635 4179268 I certainly hope so.
4179270 4182505 I'm the CEO<br />of Cyberdyne Systems.
4182507 4184773 I should go.
4184775 4186009 Boomer, take him down.
4186011 4188181 Everyone hold on<br />a goddamn second!
4192650 4193849 Boomer!
4198658 4199790 Hey, any luck yet?
4199792 4201024 - No.<br />- You?
4201026 4203260 Go! Go! Go!<br />I got it! I got it!
4203262 4205062 Let's go! Come on!
4215074 4216474 Sorry. Sorry.
4216476 4217643 Hey, Ryan! Ryan!
4218110 4219609 Oh, shit.
4219611 4221045 Um, uh...
4221047 4222679 Okay, okay.
4222681 4224149 Shit! Okay.
4227218 4230756 Michelle, I'm open!<br />Hit me. Baby.
4232658 4234858 - Oh-ho-ho!<br />- Security!
4234860 4236493 No, you don't.
4236495 4237960 Oh, shit!
4237962 4239162 Kev, up here! Throw it!
4239164 4240430 I got it!
4240432 4243666 Oh! Oh, my God, yes, yes!<br />Yes, yes, yes!
4243668 4247938 Oh, no! No! No!<br />Get away! Get away!
4251677 4253209 Okay. Oh!
4253211 4254678 Go to the other side!
4254680 4256479 Oh, my God!
4256481 4258514 Annie! Annie,<br />where are you?
4258516 4261486 - Max! Max!<br />- Over here! Hey!
4268226 4269660 No! No, no.
4271829 4273231 Get off me!
4276802 4277867 No!
4277869 4279204 Oh!
4280137 4282175 That was easy.
4290749 4295184 Man, glass tables<br />are acting weird tonight.
4295186 4297720 Go, go, go!
4297722 4299223 Get in the van!
4299225 4300956 Get in, get in, get in!
4300958 4302992 - Get 'em!<br />- Get 'em!
4317776 4319609 So, you don't wanna<br />have a baby,
4319611 4321513 so we can do<br />more shit like that?
4322213 4324480 No. No.
4324482 4326517 Is that the fruit<br />you were thinking about?
4326519 4329053 Mmm-mmm.<br />That's not the fruit. No.
4329055 4330720 Hey, thanks for the assist.
4330722 4332622 Yeah.
4332624 4335593 I don't even know why<br />I really did it.
4335595 4337126 Do you think it's 'cause<br />you're falling for me?
4339864 4340899 I...
4341734 4343767 Not... Not sure.
4343769 4346135 Ugh. I was joking.
4346137 4348839 Oh. Okay. Yeah.
4348841 4351207 Aren't you gonna say<br />you were joking, too?
4351209 4354077 - Do you want me to?<br />- Oh, my God,
4354079 4355679 - Stop it.<br />- Okay, fine.
4355681 4357447 It's two minutes to 12:00.<br />Where the hell is this bridge?
4357449 4358948 GPS says<br />it's right around here,
4358950 4360550 but I don't see it.
4360552 4362484 Oh, oh. Oh.<br />There it is. 4th Street.
4362486 4365288 Oh, shit!
4369962 4372528 - Oh, my.<br />- That's great.
4372530 4374833 That's great. Now they're<br />gonna kill my brother.
4376802 4377837 Oh, God!
4378669 4380804 Hold on.
4380806 4383740 I'm not an expert, but these<br />gems look plastic to me.
4383742 4386309 "Made in China."<br />Is this thing not even real?
4386311 4388144 Maybe just that sticker<br />was made in China.
4388146 4389379 - Let's let them talk.<br />- Can I see?
4389381 4390648 Hey,<br />why would The Bulgarian
4390650 4392549 ask Brooks to bring him<br />a fake egg?
4392551 4395518 Uh, I don't think<br />he wanted an egg at all.
4395520 4398723 I think he wanted<br />what was inside the egg.
4399525 4401858 "WITSEC."<br />What is that?
4401860 4403093 Um...
4403095 4405231 We could ask them?
4421879 4423913 You tell anyone<br />we were coming here?
4423915 4425415 No.
4425417 4426616 I've got your egg.
4426618 4429251 - You do?<br />- Yeah, but we broke it.
4429253 4430720 - What?<br />- Well, it was a fake.
4430722 4432589 But we have the list of names<br />that was inside.
4432591 4434293 That's what you wanted, right?
4437395 4439661 Okay. Get on the ground.
4439663 4441831 We've got what you want.<br />Can't you just let us go?
4441833 4444535 I said, "On the ground!"
4444537 4446303 You too, playboy, get over<br />there. Get on the ground.
4446305 4447804 Yeah.
4447806 4449906 None of that<br />child pose shit, either.
4449908 4452474 The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,<br />probably you guys, too.
4452476 4454077 Why did you come here?
4454079 4455745 Because you're my brother,<br />and I can't just let you die,
4455747 4459349 even though<br />you might deserve it.
4459351 4461952 You're unbelievable,<br />you know that?
4461954 4464420 You've always been<br />a better person than me.
4464422 4466322 You gotta shut up. Okay?
4466324 4469225 Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.
4469227 4472027 I'm not the carefree dude that<br />wins at everything he touches.
4472029 4473130 You know how I win?
4473132 4474630 I cheat.<br />I cheat at everything.
4474632 4476868 I even cheated when we were<br />kids playing Battleship.
4478637 4479768 What?
4479770 4481904 Didn't you ever wonder<br />why I made you sit
4481906 4483238 with your back to the TV?
4483240 4486309 It was so I could see<br />your ships in the reflection.
4486311 4489846 I mean, I even took five grand<br />every time we played Monopoly
4489848 4491581 before we even<br />started playing the game.
4491583 4495085 I cheated at the Game of Life.<br />And at the game of life.
4495087 4496553 You son of a bitch.
4496555 4499855 - You son of a bitch!<br />- Yo, sit down.
4499857 4501890 - What about you, Princess?<br />- I don't have anything.
4501892 4505562 But it didn't stop there,<br />because when we grew up, Max,
4505564 4508598 you went off<br />to college, and I...
4508600 4510966 You got a career, you...
4510968 4513803 You married the greatest girl<br />in the world.
4513805 4515938 I knew I couldn't keep up<br />with that success.
4515940 4517707 So I...
4517709 4520009 I told everyone that I got<br />a job on Wall Street.
4520011 4521577 And I did.
4521579 4524350 Selling coke to traders.
4525618 4527317 You didn't invest in Panera?
4527319 4528885 I ate at Panera.
4528887 4530554 Jesus Christ.
4530556 4532054 What's going on?
4532056 4533924 But that's why I've been<br />trying to make it up to you.
4533926 4535558 That's what this whole<br />game night was about.
4535560 4539630 See, I had it rigged<br />so that you'd finally win.
4539632 4542631 The last clue<br />was gonna lead you...
4542633 4544102 Your jacket pocket.
4554245 4555480 Huh.
4557449 4559719 Surprise.
4562753 4565221 I even managed to fuck<br />that up, though. I'm so sorry.
4565223 4569326 I'm so sorry, Max.
4569328 4571560 I think we're gonna be okay,<br />though. I got a feeling.
4571562 4572931 You want us to kill them all?
4574098 4575465 - What?<br />- Okay.
4575467 4576566 Wait, wait.<br />Just let us go.
4576568 4577968 We won't tell anyone anything.
4577970 4579868 We got you the list!
4579870 4582607 - What the fuck, man?<br />- Fuck! God damn it!
4584476 4585541 - Oh, shit. The fuzz.<br />- Fuck, man!
4585543 4587077 Freeze!
4587079 4587978 Gary?
4587980 4589411 Don't even think<br />about it, pig.
4589413 4591380 Can't say I care<br />for that nomenclature.
4594352 4595654 Get down!
4596421 4598423 Come on, bitch!
4605530 4607031 God damn it!
4614640 4616605 Hey, isn't that your neighbor?
4616607 4618308 When did Gary<br />get so cool?
4618310 4620477 - Oh, my God!<br />- Everybody okay?
4620479 4622179 - You're cool-ass Gary.<br />- You all right?
4622181 4624380 Fine, thank you.
4624382 4626416 Though, in sliding,<br />my belt buckle
4626418 4628452 may have inadvertently<br />scratched
4628454 4629920 the finish of my squad car.
4629922 4631653 How did you know<br />we were in trouble?
4631655 4634491 The nocturnal Jenga game,
4634493 4636660 my blood-spattered<br />marital souvenirs,
4636662 4640796 and Max's curious search<br />history piqued my interest.
4640798 4643198 - Right. Oh, God.<br />- You, uh...
4643200 4645033 You saved our lives.
4645035 4646635 Thank you.
4646637 4648506 Just doing my job.
4649641 4650941 - Oh, my God!<br />- Oh!
4650943 4653012 - Shit!<br />- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
4654145 4656313 Gary!
4656315 4658548 Hello? I need<br />an ambulance. Officer down.
4658550 4659782 - Oh, shit!<br />- Hang in there, pal.
4659784 4661416 Hang on, hang on, pal.
4661418 4662652 Hang on.<br />You're gonna be all right.
4662654 4663786 We're gonna<br />get you to a hospital.
4663788 4665421 Okay, look at me. Gary, look.
4665423 4667456 You have got<br />a lot to live for, okay?
4667458 4668691 Do I?
4668693 4670193 - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br />- Yeah.
4670195 4671797 I have no wife.
4673464 4675264 - No friends.<br />- That's not true.
4675266 4676465 No, don't say that.
4676467 4677567 You got us.<br />We're your friends.
4677569 4678935 You've got us.
4678937 4682906 You don't even like<br />spending time with me.
4682908 4684240 Yes, we do.<br />We just...
4684242 4686175 We've been a little selfish,<br />that's all.
4686177 4687609 - Right, right.<br />- I'm sorry about that.
4687611 4689045 Oh, God. Oh, God.
4689047 4692014 - Bastian.<br />- Huh?
4692016 4694416 Someone please take care<br />of Bastian.
4694418 4697621 Gary, you are gonna take care<br />of Bastian yourself, okay?
4697623 4699255 Listen. As soon as you get out<br />of the hospital,
4699257 4701160 you're gonna come to every<br />single game night we have.
4702494 4704294 Don't...
4704296 4705362 Yeah?
4705364 4707529 Don't you
4707531 4709568 ever
4710334 4712268 exclude me again.
4712270 4715006 - Never exclude you again, pal.<br />- No.
4717008 4719443 - Oh, God. What is that?<br />- What's that?
4719445 4721844 Is that a blood clot?
4721846 4723979 It's a blood capsule.
4723981 4726683 - Huh?<br />- A blood capsule?
4726685 4731557 And that is how you do<br />a game night.
4734193 4735226 What?
4737495 4739095 I've duped you all.
4739097 4740897 Wha...
4740899 4742866 Hold on a second.<br />Are you telling me
4742868 4744300 that this whole thing<br />was a game?
4746070 4748138 What? What?
4748140 4749605 - They, they...<br />- Shit!
4749607 4751374 I'm sorry. They got up.<br />They got up.
4751376 4753143 When I learned you stopped<br />inviting me to your game nights,
4753145 4755911 I hijacked Brooks'<br />murder mystery party
4755913 4758413 and I staged a kidnapping<br />of my own.
4758415 4759816 You gotta be kidding me.
4759818 4761318 What better way<br />to prove my worth
4761320 4762719 as a game night participant?
4762721 4764920 Well, what about these dudes?<br />Are they actors?
4764922 4767157 Oh, no. They're...<br />They're felons.
4767159 4768291 Felons?
4768293 4769893 I was able to shave some<br />time off of their parole
4769895 4772661 in exchange for<br />this little side project.
4772663 4774730 - We square now?<br />- Thank you, gentlemen.
4774732 4776032 That lady hit me with the car.
4776034 4777901 Hey, what the hell kinda<br />psycho are you?
4777903 4780469 You put us through all this,<br />just for your own amusement?
4780471 4784240 No, no. Just the opposite.<br />For your amusement.
4784242 4785175 Did everyone have fun?
4785177 4786975 - No! No.<br />- Yeah. No.
4786977 4789880 - No fun! I got shot!<br />- By me!
4789882 4791413 I don't see<br />how that's possible.
4791415 4792749 My men were using blanks.
4792751 4794751 Well, that was my gun.<br />It was a real gun.
4794753 4797152 So, this whole thing,<br />the Faberge egg,
4797154 4798990 The Bulgarian.<br />That was you?
4800592 4801724 You've lost me.
4801726 4804094 The egg, the WITSEC list?
4804096 4806332 It's all you.<br />All part of your game?
4809333 4812167 This is a list of people in the<br />Federal Witness Protection program.
4812169 4814737 - How did you get this?<br />- From inside the egg.
4814739 4815837 Stop fucking with us.<br />It's over!
4815839 4817107 I'm not fudging with you.
4817109 4818977 I honestly have no idea<br />what...
4820878 4824080 Oh, boy. Yikes!
4824082 4825314 I mean, how stupid<br />do you think we are?
4825316 4826883 - Hey, Max...<br />- Gang, are we looking
4826885 4829051 at the big twist here?<br />He gets shot again!
4829053 4830687 And by who?<br />A couple of new characters
4830689 4831987 you introduce<br />at the last minute.
4831989 4833756 Dude, you've jumped the shark!
4833758 4835358 Do you go to the magic shop<br />to buy a bunch
4835360 4837395 - of these little bullets?<br />- No.
4839530 4840929 Hang on.
4840931 4842165 This is Officer Kingsbury.
4842167 4843700 We got a 10-00<br />on the 4th Street...
4847137 4849307 Which one of you<br />is Brooks Davis?
4852177 4854380 It's funny, you don't look<br />like an asshole.
4855580 4858113 Do I look like<br />as asshole to you?
4858115 4859447 No.
4859449 4861250 One of us has to be the<br />asshole in this transaction
4861252 4863051 because otherwise<br />I'd have my egg,
4863053 4864621 and you'd have your money.
4864623 4867826 But instead, we've wasted<br />our night tracking you down.
4869092 4870792 Now we're gonna<br />have to kill you.
4870794 4872996 - What? No, no, no, no.<br />- What?
4872998 4874464 Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?
4874466 4877634 Hi, I'm Max.<br />I'm Brooks' brother.
4877636 4879768 And you know, look.<br />He screwed up.
4879770 4881203 - Right? You got greedy.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4881205 4882404 He admits it.
4882406 4884674 Good news is, though,<br />that we got your egg.
4884676 4886876 It is broken.<br />Uh, my screw-up.
4886878 4889813 But, um, I got the list.
4889815 4891413 Which I bet you've been after<br />this whole time.
4891415 4892648 What about this?
4892650 4895285 How about
4895287 4896819 you take this list
4896821 4899354 for free, and we all go<br />our separate ways?
4899356 4900990 Nobody gets hurt.
4900992 4904693 Uh, except the poor folks<br />on this list, I'm guessing.
4906597 4907800 Okay.
4908266 4909432 Okay?
4909434 4911634 Deal. Makes perfect sense.
4911636 4913769 No, no. You give him<br />that list, he's gonna kill me.
4913771 4915440 That's nonsense.
4918342 4920475 What the hell<br />is wrong with you?
4920477 4921943 I'm just trying to buy myself<br />some time.
4921945 4923545 Not much.
4923547 4925917 We're just gonna cut it out<br />of you on the jet. Take him.
4929287 4931086 Don't follow us, Max.<br />I'm serious!
4931088 4933391 I'm not worried about that.
4936793 4938327 You just letting them go?
4938329 4940662 Yeah, they've done<br />nothing wrong.
4940664 4942865 Only this one.
4942867 4944567 - Let's go.<br />- Don't follow us!
4944569 4947437 Gary! He's breathing.
4947439 4948804 You know, the only<br />private air terminal
4948806 4949871 around here is at Conway.
4949873 4951808 Yeah. How are we<br />gonna get there?
4951810 4953443 Brooks' house is not<br />that far from here.
4953445 4954747 But our car's not there.
4955980 4957315 Yeah, it is.
4966925 4968357 You know,<br />you don't have to do this
4968359 4970259 because I can just<br />poop it out.
4970261 4972562 We're not gonna go digging<br />through your feces.
4972564 4973929 That's disgusting!
4973931 4976032 Now, hold still<br />while I cut your stomach open.
4976034 4977503 No, no! No! Whoa!
4978669 4980071 What the hell?
4982039 4983907 - Is that...<br />- That's my brother.
4983909 4985608 Get us in the air.
4985610 4986845 Now!
4997788 4999023 - Hold on!<br />- Oh!
5002360 5003792 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, you?
5003794 5004997 - Yup, good.<br />- Okay.
5009635 5011233 Okay, okay. What's our plan?
5011235 5013870 I have one idea.<br />It's so crazy,
5013872 5015170 though, baby,<br />it just might work.
5015172 5016639 You're gonna crash the car<br />into the plane,
5016641 5018340 like Liam Neeson in Taken 3?
5018342 5020211 He did that in Taken 3, huh?
5024347 5025749 - All right, are you ready?<br />- Uh-huh.
5025751 5027418 Here we go!
5029553 5031155 Oh, my God!
5032723 5034924 Uh, you missed it.
5034926 5036261 Thanks, baby.
5041097 5042432 Brooks, we're coming!
5042434 5044035 Whoo!
5061453 5065257 Well, at least I got to<br />drive it for 10 minutes.
5067325 5068258 Oh, my God.
5068260 5069858 - We have to hide.<br />- Yeah.
5069860 5071027 Okay. Go.
5071029 5074196 Oh, shit! Shit!
5074198 5076501 Go, go, go! It's stuck.
5077703 5078971 Fuck!
5079538 5081073 God damn it!
5098823 5100188 Where you at, lady?
5100190 5103158 Come on, you little bitch.
5103160 5106395 I know you're back here<br />somewhere.
5106397 5110265 Let's end this shit.<br />I won't kill you. Come out!
5110267 5112301 Come on,<br />get your ass out here!
5112303 5114402 Turn on the belt!
5114404 5115971 - I'm not gonna hurt you.<br />- Look at the box!
5115973 5118774 - Just come on out, let's talk!<br />- Can you charade it to me?
5118776 5121077 Charades?
5121079 5123278 That's some<br />cute full-circle bullshit.
5123280 5125148 Here we go. Three words.
5125150 5127486 Come on, lady. Where are you?
5129788 5130953 Turn.
5130955 5132520 Turn, turn, turn. Turn.
5132522 5133590 On.
5133592 5136461 Turn on. Turn on what?<br />Turn on what?
5138163 5140261 Turn on belt?
5140263 5143101 Turn on belt!
5152110 5154513 Boy, that's a slow belt.
5164989 5166255 Hey!
5166257 5169559 - Okay.<br />- Oh, God! Annie!
5171962 5173362 Oh, boy, that was...
5173364 5174563 You saw what I was going for,<br />though, right?
5174565 5176265 Yeah, yeah.<br />But then did you see
5176267 5177901 when I hit him<br />with the fire extinguisher?
5177903 5180068 - I sure did. I sure did, yeah.<br />- That was cool, right? Yeah.
5180070 5181670 - Yeah.<br />- Great.
5181672 5182839 Do you want this?
5182841 5184974 I don't want you to have it,<br />Calamity Jane.
5184976 5186341 All right, look.
5186343 5188544 I think I saw a hatch<br />at the top of the plane.
5188546 5190312 Maybe I can get<br />the drop on him.
5190314 5192048 - "The drop?"<br />- Yup, yeah.
5192050 5193448 - Who are you?<br />- Why don't you go use the emergency phone?
5193450 5194483 Call for help.<br />I'm gonna do the drop.
5194485 5196719 Okay. You're not Liam Neeson!
5196721 5199091 - That hurts my feelings!<br />- I'm sorry!
5208967 5210702 That's enough of this shit.
5231021 5232223 Max!
5233357 5234890 I can't get the drop<br />on anyone tonight.
5234892 5236224 Put that little knife down!
5236226 5238126 Right now! That's it.
5238128 5240263 Ahh!
5240265 5242200 Right in my bullet hole.
5247305 5249307 Come on, come on, come on.
5252843 5254046 Shit!
5258283 5259484 Stop!
5260851 5262053 Drop it!
5263788 5265220 Wait, wait. Um...
5265222 5268493 You don't have to do this.<br />I have kids at home.
5269293 5271059 Not with that ass you don't.
5271061 5272827 Oh. Well...
5272829 5274330 Thank you.
5274332 5275697 You're welcome.
5277569 5280105 Shit!
5282373 5284741 Yes!
5284743 5286709 Oh, no, he died!
5317208 5319709 And that's how you get<br />the drop on someone!
5319711 5320811 Oh, my God!
5321913 5323312 Oh. Oh!
5323314 5325417 - I gotcha! I gotcha!<br />- This is high.
5326883 5328184 You're amazing.
5328186 5329684 - You can cut me loose now.<br />- Thank you!
5329686 5330719 Okay. Okay, okay.
5330721 5332721 - Uh...<br />- Yeah. In the bag.
5332723 5334122 - This? Okay.<br />- Look in the bag.
5334124 5336157 - That's right.<br />- Okay.
5336159 5337492 Oh! Thank you!
5337494 5339530 - Okay. You all right?<br />- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
5343066 5345201 Whoa. Well, look at that.
5345203 5346568 You put a bungee cord<br />in your hand,
5346570 5348770 you go straight<br />to the pervy place, don't you?
5348772 5352274 Hey. You saved my life.<br />Thank you.
5352276 5353776 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
5353778 5356379 I mean, I just saw a man die,<br />but I'm... I'm okay.
5357582 5359081 Is that a knife<br />in your bullet hole?
5359083 5361153 Uh-huh. Hey.<br />I wanna have a baby.
5361852 5363051 Uh, what?
5363053 5364487 I used to think<br />that I wanted Brooks' life,
5364489 5366220 but, you know,<br />turns out he was just...
5366222 5367724 You're a loser.<br />He's a loser.
5367726 5368590 Uh, guilty.
5368592 5370526 But us making a family?
5370528 5373895 That's not pellets.<br />That's the fruit.
5373897 5375798 That's fruit, it's fruit.
5375800 5377265 Wait. What's going on?
5377267 5379367 Plus, think about all the<br />dum-dums that have kids, right?
5379369 5380569 And think about<br />how much better
5380571 5382004 our kid is gonna be<br />than their kids.
5382006 5384240 It's gonna beat their kids<br />at everything.
5384242 5385640 It's taken you this long<br />to see that?
5385642 5387710 Our baby is gonna crush<br />every other baby.
5387712 5389711 I'm sorry, that's right. And<br />not in that peak-too-early,
5389713 5391147 you know,<br />kid actor kind of way.
5391149 5392581 Mmm-mmm. No.
5392583 5394316 We will parcel out<br />his or her gifts over time.
5394318 5395617 - Absolutely.<br />- Yes.
5395619 5396885 We gotta teach it Mandarin<br />right away.
5396887 5398019 'Cause China's the future.
5398021 5399221 - It sure is.<br />- Yeah.
5399223 5401193 - You're the future.<br />- Oh, my God.
5404361 5405596 Hmm?
5406698 5409267 And that concludes<br />my game night.
5410034 5411133 - What?<br />- What?
5411135 5412501 It went exactly as I planned.
5412503 5415537 You learned every lesson<br />that I wanted you to.
5415539 5417609 Trevor, you can get up now.
5422579 5423946 I'm just fucking with you.
5423948 5425380 But that would've been<br />really cool, right?
5425382 5426948 You're such a dick.
5436628 5439062 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Hey!
5439064 5441464 - Hey, hey!<br />- Hey!
5441466 5442764 Come on, come on.
5442766 5444533 Hey, thanks for letting me<br />host again, huh?
5444535 5446501 Well, it's not like<br />we had a choice, huh?
5446503 5448438 Only 36 months to go.
5448440 5449705 Oh, time will fly.
5449707 5450872 - Can I get you a beer?<br />- Uh, yeah.
5450874 5452742 - Come on!<br />- Hey, listen, Brooks.
5452744 5455643 I know you're probably feeling<br />pretty humbled by all of this.
5455645 5457412 But, honestly, I think<br />you're gonna come out
5457414 5459148 the other side<br />a much better man.
5459150 5460549 Oh! Hey, look.
5460551 5461983 I completely agree.
5461985 5464086 You remember the WITSEC list<br />that I swallowed?
5464088 5465455 - Sure.<br />- I pooped it out,
5465457 5468791 sold it for $3 million<br />on the black market.
5468793 5471160 - Are you serious?<br />- Pretty sweet, huh?
5471162 5473428 Brooks, everybody on that list<br />is gonna get killed.
5473430 5474830 Oh, no, Max,<br />I'm not a monster.
5474832 5477398 I tipped everyone off<br />that they were in danger.
5477400 5479867 For $20,000 apiece.
5479869 5481937 You're unbelievable.
5481939 5483005 Thank you. It's not like
5483007 5484438 I'm gonna live<br />in this dump forever.
5484440 5485674 As soon as<br />this cuff comes off,
5485676 5486742 I'm gonna buy that house<br />I was renting.
5486744 5488279 I'm moving in with Johanna.
5489079 5490212 There she is.
5490214 5492747 - Hey, Dr. Chin!<br />- Hey, Max.
5492749 5494316 - Let's play.<br />- Yeah.
5494318 5495951 Uh, The Crying Game?
5495953 5497620 Uh, Boys Don't Cry?
5497622 5499688 Is that a tear?<br />Is that the actor?
5499690 5501122 - Mr. Potato Head.<br />- Are you drawing the actor?
5501124 5502325 - Cry-Baby?<br />- Yes!
5502327 5504527 - Time!<br />- It was The Green Mile.
5504529 5507429 - What?<br />- How is that The Green Mile?
5507431 5510198 This is me<br />at the Regal Cinema crying
5510200 5513670 as I did through<br />much of the film.
5513672 5515170 How we supposed<br />to know that, Gary?
5515172 5518742 I assume everyone cried<br />during The Green Mile.
5519577 5521577 - So, who's next?<br />- I'll go.
5521579 5523144 - Yeah!<br />- Go, baby.
5523146 5524345 Nice try, Gary.
5524347 5526215 And go!
5526217 5527515 Uh...
5527517 5529184 - It's a rock.<br />- A bean? A rock!
5529186 5530719 - A ball?<br />- That's a...
5530721 5532087 - Burger. Is that a burger?<br />- Football!
5532089 5533456 No, oh, that's<br />a dinner roll, right?
5533458 5534724 - A bun!<br />- Bread?
5534726 5536258 Is it a bun?<br />Looks like a bun.
5536260 5537626 French loaf?
5537628 5538993 Is this a motion picture?
5538995 5540528 A bun is in a house.<br />On a train.
5540530 5541831 Are we supposed<br />to announce it?
5541833 5542898 - Microwave?<br />- It's being cooked.
5542900 5544367 It's in an oven.<br />Bun in the oven!
5544369 5545468 Yes, yes, yes!
5545470 5547835 Wait. What?
5547837 5549373 Yes.
5550473 5551874 You pregnant?
5551876 5553445 We did it.
5561084 5563652 Oh, my gosh!<br />They're having a baby!
5563654 5565557 They're having a baby!
5566423 5568424 Oh, my God!
5974864 5976197 How you doing?
5976199 5978133 - Hi.<br />- I'm Kenny.
5978135 5979934 Nice to meet you, Kenny.
5981437 5984005 Usually people cut me off<br />and say they know who I am.
5984007 5985107 Oh, yeah?
5985109 5987378 Yeah. I didn't<br />catch your name.
5987979 5989814 I'm Debbie.
