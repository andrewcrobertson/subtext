39949 43339 Whoo!
43429 45624 Who cares about<br />winning? Let's get drunk!
46309 47789 Let's do it.
47870 50338 Let's get you drunk, Merkins.<br />You, too, Borgs.
50430 52261 I'm thirsty. Huh?
53470 55779 I need four shots of vodka,<br />four shots of water.
55870 57766 I want you to send the vodka<br />over to the Merkins.
57790 59508 Send the water to us. You understand?
59590 61287 What former<br />Supreme Court Justice...
61311 62903 - Oliver Wendell Holmes!<br />- Correct.
62991 64344 Yes!
64431 67070 Again, I'd like to ask the players<br />to allow me to...
67151 68789 T o finish the question.
68951 70304 Very funny.
70511 72502 Okay, okay.<br />This is getting embarrassing,
72591 74469 so we need to focus
74632 76065 because this isn't a game.
76272 77751 It literally is.
77912 80187 Bill, do not test me right now.
80272 81952 Looks like<br />we're down to two teams.
82352 84502 So, for double points,
84592 86867 what is the name<br />of the purple Teletubby?
87672 90233 - Tinky Winky!<br />- You're both correct.
91713 93351 He always carried a...
93513 95265 - Red purse.<br />- Yeah.
95433 98072 - And he loved big hugs.<br />- Big hugs.
98233 100144 I know. I'm Max.
100313 101666 Annie.
119715 121731 Ha-ha! You're never gonna be able<br />to hold on to Asia! You hear me?
121755 123905 Hey, if you take Kamchatka,<br />and I take Mongolia,
124115 125475 we could trap Linda in the middle.
125515 126651 - Starve out her armies.<br />- Hey!
126675 127824 You can't form alliances.
128035 129674 Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?
129836 131554 You're high-fiving Hitler?
133876 135707 All right, you got this. Last one.
136396 139035 Oh, that's Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.
139236 140385 Yes!
140556 141556 I'm up. I feel good.
141756 142791 Two words.
142956 144470 Bill. Overweight.
144677 145792 - No.<br />- Single. Out of work.
145877 146877 What the fuck?
146957 148276 Hairy.
148437 149916 Uh, carry, marry.
150077 151146 Marry!
151317 152955 You. Me.
153037 154037 Marry me?
154117 155757 Dude, we got it! We got it!
156237 158308 Annie, will you?
158398 159877 Will you marry me?
159958 161438 - Is that a yes? That's a yes!<br />- Yeah!
161558 163708 I'm really happy for you guys.
177599 179319 - Ooh, lot of pressure here.<br />- Yeah.
179399 180719 You miss, you lose it all.
180799 181834 Stay out of my head.
181919 183855 And you know you have a distinct<br />advantage with the smaller hands, right?
183879 185359 Your goal posts are not as big.
185520 187296 Well, I guess you<br />should've married Uma Thurman.
187320 188560 Yeah, that would've been great.
188600 190800 There's a snap. Here's the hold.
191400 192879 - Ooh!<br />- And a text.
192960 194154 That was interference.
194240 195896 Sorry, honey. I know how much<br />that meant to you.
195920 197478 Come on.
197560 198880 Dr. Chin is ready for you.
198961 200030 Uh, great.
200121 202794 I think we've determined why you've<br />been having trouble conceiving.
202961 205555 - Okay. Let's have it.<br />- Okay, great.
205721 207916 Oh, what's that look? Is it me?<br />Of course, it's me.
208001 210071 I'm not loving your semen.
210161 211230 Oh?
211321 214314 Your count is excellent,<br />but your motility is well below normal.
214482 216359 - That's too bad.<br />- What would cause that?
216522 219355 It can be genetic,<br />environmental factors.
219522 221831 Nine times out of 10, though,<br />it's psychological.
222002 224516 Have you been feeling<br />anxious or stressed?
224722 226839 No, I don't think so. Not really.
227003 228482 Uh... He's always a little stressed.
229403 230659 You don't have to write... I'm not...
230683 231843 Honey, she's writing it down.
231963 235194 Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.
235323 236323 We sure are.
236443 238019 One of the reasons<br />I fell in love with him.
238043 241878 Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more<br />prone to stress than normal people.
242044 243955 "Normal people"?
244044 245380 How long has this been going on, Max?
245404 246598 It's not going on.
247084 249552 Oh, well, you did say,<br />even when you were a kid,
249644 251714 you would freak out<br />if you lost at anything.
252164 254421 - Oh, I was a kid.<br />- Especially if you lost to your brother.
254445 255560 Hmm.
256205 258002 Hey, is that what this is?
258085 259085 No.
259165 262874 You have been so uptight since you<br />found out that Brooks is coming to town.
262965 264541 - I don't think that's true.<br />- Could that be a factor in all this?
264565 265565 Let's be fair.
265645 267955 Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.
268046 270116 Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.
270286 271878 - The what?<br />- The brothers.
272046 274606 I'm not sure why we're discussing this.<br />She's not a therapist.
274766 276757 You're not a therapist, right?<br />With all respect.
276926 278439 - No, but I am a doctor.<br />- Sure.
278526 280482 And I believe in<br />treating the whole patient.
280566 283639 So, what is it about your brother<br />that makes you feel emasculated?
283807 285240 Are we gonna do this?
285407 287223 We're right next to the room<br />where I masturbated.
287247 290637 I think he has it in his head<br />that Brooks is cooler
290727 293799 and more successful<br />and hotter than he is.
293887 295162 I never said hotter.
295328 296807 He's charming.
297008 299283 That's interesting. And is he single?
299448 300448 What's that?
300528 303804 I don't know if I mentioned it, but<br />Keith and I are on a trial separation.
303888 305207 - Oh.<br />- Keith?
305768 306803 Uh, Keith.
306888 309145 So, do you think your brother would<br />wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?
309169 310238 Gosh, I don't know.
310409 311808 Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.
311969 313402 Hurts a little.
313609 315998 Now, is he a tall fellow?<br />'Cause I'm only 5'2".
316169 317522 We're all done with my semen?
317689 319122 He is taller than Max.
319289 321519 - Good.<br />- But he did date this ballerina once,
321609 323407 and she was<br />just a teeny-tiny little thing.
342611 343885 Ooh.
343971 346326 Honey, Gary.<br />Don't mention game night, okay?
346411 347446 Mmm-hmm.
347531 349328 - Good evening, Max.<br />- Hey, Gary.
349491 350686 - Annie.<br />- Hello there.
350852 352444 Hi, Gary!
352932 354445 Just checking the mail.
354532 355567 Oh, yeah?
355652 357228 Some people check it earlier in the day,
357252 361086 but there's always a risk<br />that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.
362092 366450 This spares me the chance<br />of a futile trip to the mailbox.
368093 369242 Uh-huh.
369333 373645 Plus, it allows Bastian here<br />the opportunity to urinate.
374733 376451 You have a good one.
376613 377808 Any plans for this evening?
377974 379248 No.
379894 381293 Perhaps a game night?
381454 382853 We're just gonna stay in,
382974 384248 - just the two of us.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
384334 385926 - Boring.<br />- Mmm.
386094 387413 I see.
388614 393450 I do hope you keep me in mind<br />for any future game nights.
393655 394655 You bet.
394735 398444 I've always enjoyed<br />the camaraderie of good friends
398655 401567 competing in games of chance and skill.
402135 404888 Yeah.<br />Yeah, well, we'll do that,
405055 408685 but tonight, it's just the two of us.
409296 412368 Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.
418256 420566 There was a special on these tonight.
421057 422206 Three for one.
422377 423776 Three for one?
424417 425452 Yup.
425537 427732 How can that be profitable<br />for Frito Lay?
428977 430854 These corporations,
432217 434058 I don't know what they're doing.
434458 437018 Well, you two enjoy each other.
437818 442289 It's often we don't appreciate<br />what we have until it's gone.
446698 448291 - I think that's it.<br />- Okay.
448499 449614 Bye-bye!
455899 458129 If Gary sees the others coming,<br />we're screwed.
458299 459555 No, no, honey,<br />it's not gonna be a problem.
459579 461696 I was very, very clear with everyone<br />to park far away
461860 463737 and just to sneak in quietly, you know.
463900 466414 But now, I mean, you don't think<br />we're being dicks, do you?
466580 468036 I mean,<br />should we just still invite the guy?
468060 469276 He really seemed like he wanted to play.
469300 471131 No, no. Debbie was our friend,
471300 473476 and Gary was just the creepy husband<br />that we had to put up with.
473500 474501 That's true.
474581 476117 He's only gotten worse<br />since the divorce.
476141 478894 Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?<br />Fuck him!
505503 506618 Hi!
506783 508182 Hi.
511583 513175 Can we help you?
513343 514537 I'm okay.
514903 515904 Hey!
516064 518000 Of course. Ryan, why are you<br />coming in through the window?
518024 521300 You said sneak in<br />so RoboCop wouldn't see us.
521464 522824 I meant sneak in through the door.
522944 524138 Well, you were super vague.
524304 525544 - I wasn't vague at all.<br />- Wine?
525664 527240 I know I didn't say,<br />"Break the succulents."
527264 529494 - Hey.<br />- I'm not dressed for this nonsense.
529585 530585 This is ridiculous.
530665 531721 It's like<br />Night of the Living Dead in here.
531745 533345 Yeah, you are asking a lot from us, Max.
533425 534841 I didn't say<br />to come through the window.
534865 536385 This is Max. We used to work together.
536505 537641 - His wife, Annie. Michelle.<br />- Hey!
537665 538665 And that guy, Kevin.
538745 539841 - What's up, buddy?<br />- The door was right there.
539865 540900 Guys, this is Madison.
540985 542338 Yeah, you brought her last week.
542505 544383 You work at Forever 21, right?
544546 546582 - No, no.<br />- I work at Sephora.
546666 549021 - I'm confused.<br />- Different girl.
549186 550505 Same look, same voice.
550666 551735 Nice to meet you.
551946 553466 You, too.
555706 557186 - That's yours.<br />- It's...
557347 559338 No. I think you're<br />supposed to kiss it, right?
559507 560542 Welcome.
560667 562100 Do you guys have a bathroom?
562267 563643 There's one just down the hall.<br />You need it?
563667 566818 Okay, is it on the right or the left?<br />I don't wanna go in the wrong room.
566987 568136 The one with the toilet.
568307 569376 - Can't miss it.<br />- Okay.
572188 573621 - Oh, boy.<br />- Dude!
573788 575824 - Wow. Where'd you find her? TED Talk?<br />- Right?
575988 577262 No, at Chipotle.
577428 578484 Let me ask you something, Ryan.
578508 580204 Aren't you sick of<br />losing game night every week
580228 581404 because of the dates you bring?
581428 583339 They're not always that bad.
586509 587544 Heather, seriously.
587629 589789 How many photos of you<br />with the dog filter do you need?
591509 593659 Uh... "Dennis" isn't a word.
593869 596429 Uh, yeah, it is.<br />It's my daddy's name, so...
596589 599343 These are the elite,<br />the very best, the...
599430 600499 Oh, oh! White people!
600590 602182 - What?<br />- Oh, Jesus.
602270 603464 Okay, unlike you psychos,
603670 605430 I don't give a shit<br />about winning game night.
605630 607109 I don't need that validation.
607270 609551 But you do need the validation<br />of dating Instagram models?
609670 610705 Absolutely.
610870 613180 I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br />I'm not like you, Michelle.
613351 615819 We didn't all meet our soul mate<br />when we were 10 years old.
615911 616911 14.
616991 617991 - Oh, sorry.<br />- 14.
618071 619791 And we didn't get married<br />until we were 19.
619871 621623 - See, that's gross.<br />- You know what, Ryan?
621711 623906 I hope one day you<br />get to meet a lovely, young lady.
624071 626528 So you can love her as much as<br />I love my sweet baby right here.
626552 628349 Yes, find her. Look how cute this...
628512 629808 - Hey, look at this.<br />- So much love.
629832 630888 Let's look at him when we do it.
630912 632408 - Hey, everybody, grab your drinks.<br />- Find the love!
632432 633660 Let's go play, come on.
633832 637108 Dude, do you know what rich people are<br />doing on their game nights these days?
637272 638591 What's that?
638792 640073 - Fight clubs.<br />- What?
640153 641302 I just read about them.
641473 643543 They pay poor people<br />to fight each other,
643673 644849 and then they bet on the winner.
644873 646593 - No, that's not a real thing.<br />- Yes, it is!
646713 648449 If you can have anything<br />you want in this world,
648473 650589 you have to raise the stakes,<br />or life gets boring.
650753 652953 The Kennedys used to have fight clubs<br />at their compound.
653033 655970 Honey, listen, you gotta stop reading<br />BuzzFeed every second of the damn day.
655994 657690 How about some charades?<br />Huh, should we start with charades?
657714 658770 - Let's go!<br />- Yeah!
658794 659943 It's been a while, huh?
660114 661513 Do you wanna wait for Brooks?
661674 662890 I don't think we need to. No, he's late.
662914 665189 - Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?<br />- Yeah.
665354 666570 I thought he was working in Europe.
666594 668950 He was, yeah. He's apparently back<br />for some business.
669155 670155 Haven't seen him yet.
670315 672465 - But we can get started.<br />- Yeah!
672635 674731 - Who wants to start?<br />- Who are you guys talking about?
674755 677394 Max's brother. He's this super<br />successful venture capitalist.
677555 680115 Yeah, he was the first to invest<br />in Panera Bread, you know?
680275 681994 The Fuji Apple Salad was his idea.
682156 683556 - A lot of investors.<br />- Yeah.
683756 685476 He's like the Mark Wahlberg<br />to Max's Donnie.
685516 686551 Well...
686676 687745 Which is a huge compliment
687836 690350 because Donnie was fucking great<br />in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?
690436 691551 He was.
691636 693035 Was he in The Sixth Sense?
693196 695437 He sure is, yeah.<br />You know who is not in The Sixth Sense?
695517 696632 Mark Wahlberg.
696797 699231 Mark would never take a role that small.
700917 703033 Is that right, Madison?
703197 704613 Man, I haven't seen him<br />since the wedding.
704637 706628 - Remember that speech he gave?<br />- Yes.
706797 708373 And then he paid<br />for that whole firework display!
708397 709654 - Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!<br />- Little over the top.
709678 711318 Let's get started.<br />I'm gonna start us off.
711358 712854 - Yes, let's start!<br />- Here we go. Let's do it.
712878 714654 We gotta pick teams first.
714678 715774 - Movie?<br />- It's a movie. Okay.
715798 717574 - Dude, we have no teams.<br />- You just give up?
717598 719111 Better not be Brooks.
733439 735555 You didn't tell him<br />to park up the street?
735719 737119 I did, yeah, like, three times.
737960 739188 Hey!
740200 742430 He got a Stingray, huh?
745800 747233 Turn off your car!
747560 748754 What's that?
751481 752960 Hello, again.
753361 754476 Mmm...
754561 756313 Still wearing the uniform.
757721 759074 Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.
759241 761232 I hope you didn't start<br />game night without me.
763201 764351 Did you not get my text?
764522 765955 What text?
766402 767721 Oh, hello, Officer.
769562 771234 Why's that guy staring at us?
771402 773122 Gary, I want you<br />to meet my brother, Brooks.
773242 776712 We're having a little family<br />three-man game night tonight.
776882 778203 Wait, what do you mean three-man?
778283 779939 You said that Michelle<br />and Ryan and Kevin were...
779963 781442 No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.
781603 782803 I can see them in the doorway.
782883 784760 There's a whole mess of people.<br />Hey, guys!
784923 786356 - There they are.<br />- Hey!
786523 787797 These guys are leaving.
787883 788883 Take off, guys.
788963 791193 We had a little bit<br />of a mix-up with the, um...
792244 793518 - God damn it!<br />- What?
793684 795540 We didn't want him to know<br />that we're having a game night.
795564 798954 He used to come, and we don't<br />like him anymore, so...
799044 800272 Oh.
800684 802003 You know, I think he knows now.
802164 803313 He sure does.
803484 806921 Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.
807405 810158 I haven't seen you in a year!
810325 813283 Hey, you smell good.
813445 816642 What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?<br />Head and Shoulders?
816805 818445 Why do you assume<br />it's a dandruff shampoo?
818605 820982 Well, I mean, you've always<br />been a little bit of a snowstorm.
821006 822462 - Hey, would you hold that for a second?<br />- Yup.
822486 823555 Hey, guys!
823726 826240 Well, you look good, stranger.
826446 827446 It's been forever.
827606 829278 I know, and that's my fault.<br />I'm so sorry.
829606 830834 Sweet ride, Brooks.
831006 832942 Oh, you like that?<br />I just got her a couple weeks ago.
832966 834116 What is that? A Corvette?
834287 837199 It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.
837367 838561 It was my dream car as a kid.
838727 840638 And that's what<br />gave me the idea to get it.
840727 842604 You know what? I love your house.
843647 844762 Are you being sarcastic?
844967 846127 No, I mean I love your house.
846207 847846 It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.
848008 849441 Makes me think of simpler times.
849608 850961 "Simpler"?
851128 853039 Uh, so, how long are you in town for?
853128 854197 You know, I'm not sure.
854368 855767 It depends on how many clients
855848 857968 the firm's gonna be<br />having me schmooze while I'm here.
859048 860088 But hopefully for a while.
860168 862478 I don't get to see you guys, and I...
864249 866809 God, I really miss you, man.<br />I really do.
866889 868481 Oh.
869089 870568 Miss you, too, Brooks.
870929 871998 And go!
872809 874481 Shock-rocker. Dated Rose McGowan.
874570 876003 Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.
876210 877279 Yep. You got it.
877370 879281 - Quick story.<br />- There's no pausing.
879450 882146 You remember the urban myth where<br />Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out
882170 883410 so he could go down on himself?
883570 884605 Yeah.
884690 886106 You don't mind me telling the story,<br />do you, Max?
886130 887250 You're in the middle of a...
887290 889486 You were 14 years old.<br />It's an adorable story.
889651 890651 I forbid it.
890851 893001 I'm a little curious.
893171 894968 Did you blow yourself?
895251 896827 You know the bungee cords on roof racks?
896851 897851 Yeah.
897931 900968 Max took one of those bungee cords,<br />and he put it around his neck.
901131 902132 Here he goes.
902212 903588 And then he wrapped it behind his legs
903612 905887 so he could squish his face<br />down into his crotch,
906052 907565 but the problem was
907732 910326 that it got stuck!<br />He couldn't unhook it.
911212 913282 And about an hour later
913452 915727 Mom comes home, and she finds him there.
915892 916928 Shit!
917093 919053 Her little pretzel boy<br />on his bedroom floor naked.
919613 921333 Little pretzel boy?
921373 923250 Great story. Are we back on now?
923413 924687 So?
925013 926013 "So" what?
926173 927288 Did you suck it?
927653 929069 Let's go. Come on. Brooks.
929093 930494 Back to it. Come on. Play the game.
931254 933051 Poor man's Johnny Depp,<br />starred in Jericho.
933214 934567 Skeet Ulrich.
935094 937483 UN Secretary General '92 to '96.
937694 938734 Oh, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
939174 941972 This guy. He hated kids<br />in Jurassic Park.
942134 943134 Uh, Sam Neill.
943294 945047 Dubstep DJ, looks like Corey Feldman.
945135 946135 - Skrillex.<br />- Yep.
946215 948285 - Rappers love this Cubist painter.<br />- Picasso!
948495 950815 - Big cat shot by asshole dentist.<br />- Cecil the lion!
950935 952288 Time!
952375 953444 - How many?<br />- Seven!
953535 954570 Seven!
957095 958324 You're up, pretzel boy.
958496 959496 Whoo! Go, Max!
959736 961647 - Come on, Max.<br />- All right. Here we go.
961816 963613 And kick it. Go!
965376 966376 Oh, this is easy!
966456 970005 Annie, the famous actor that we met<br />at the airport about eight years ago.
971417 972417 Who?
972577 974657 Only actor we've ever met<br />at an airport who's famous.
975097 976212 Bobby Flay?
976377 979335 Not an actor. This fellow was<br />in front of us at the Sbarro.
979497 981778 We were wondering why he<br />wasn't in the first-class lounge.
981937 983495 Oh, yes, yes.
984017 985018 Who was that?
985178 986213 God damn it!
986298 987834 Max, there's a whole room of people<br />to help you out here.
987858 988927 - Use us.<br />- Good point.
989458 991058 He was the Incredible Hulk.
991218 992253 Eric Bana.
992458 994369 - Other one.<br />- Um, Mark Ruffalo.
994538 995898 - Other one.<br />- Lou Ferrigno.
996018 998009 Holy shit! Primal Fear.
998218 1000019 Richard Gere never played<br />the Incredible Hulk.
1000099 1002010 - Time.<br />- Motherfucking Ed Norton!
1002139 1003288 Oh!
1003379 1004414 Primal Fear!
1004579 1005728 Oh, my God!
1005899 1006899 He was the Hulk.
1007019 1008577 - The Hulk.<br />- I forgot that.
1008659 1010456 Max. Zero points.
1010619 1013453 I'd say he blew it,<br />but he won't tell us, will he?
1016100 1017852 Shit! Did you?
1018020 1020056 I can't believe I didn't get Bob Barker.
1020220 1023292 Hey, guys! What do you say<br />we do this at my house next week?
1023700 1024916 - House? What house?<br />- Ooh. Really?
1024940 1027461 Since I don't know how long<br />I'm gonna be here, I rented a place.
1027621 1029020 It's only a couple miles away.
1029181 1030534 You know, it's up on Broadmoor.
1030701 1032134 Oh! Swanky neighborhood.
1032301 1034861 It's a very cool house,<br />but it's just me there alone.
1035021 1036932 It'd be great<br />to have you guys come over.
1037101 1040731 Oh, well, it's kind of a tradition<br />to have game nights here.
1040902 1042096 But you know what?
1042302 1044213 Let's let him show off<br />his big house, huh?
1044382 1045656 That's the spirit!
1045822 1047096 Trust me.
1048502 1052051 This will be a game night to remember.
1052742 1053937 - Oh, boy.<br />- Mmm.
1054023 1055058 Promise?
1055143 1057199 Good night, everybody.<br />I love you much. Drive safely.
1057223 1058338 - Kisses!<br />- All right.
1058503 1060061 - Take it easy.<br />- Bye.
1060223 1062862 That little motherfucker.
1063223 1064338 Whoa!
1064423 1066618 Well, I mean, come on.
1066783 1068775 We don't see him in over a year.
1068944 1071504 He shows up in your dream car,
1071664 1074542 insults our house, and then tells<br />an embarrassing story about you
1074704 1076864 right before your turn<br />just to throw you off your game.
1076984 1079704 Welcome to my whole life. Why are you<br />suddenly so worked up about it?
1079864 1081585 Well, cause now<br />he's messing with your balls
1081745 1083701 and literally killing<br />millions of our babies.
1083865 1085503 Well, that's a little dramatic,
1085665 1087621 but, yeah, you know,<br />I mean, that's Brooks.
1087785 1089945 I thought that this<br />was just regular old brother stuff,
1090025 1091321 - but I totally see it now.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1091345 1093256 He undermines you every chance he gets.
1093345 1094460 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1094545 1096423 - It's crazy!<br />- Thank you, Annie.
1096586 1098702 You know, I've never won<br />a single game against him.
1098906 1099906 I just...
1099986 1102580 I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.
1103866 1105060 - Fix it?<br />- Yeah.
1105226 1106226 What are you suggesting?
1106386 1108456 I'm suggesting we beat his ass.
1108666 1110464 Jesus Christ.
1111867 1113619 Good evening.
1113787 1115698 We're gonna skip the cleanup?
1121107 1122825 Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?
1122988 1124706 No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.
1124868 1126204 - I'm gonna stay alert and ready.<br />- Evening!
1126228 1127388 Jesus, Gary!
1128428 1129577 Where are you headed?
1129748 1132387 We are going to, uh, to my brother's.
1132748 1134864 Another game night?
1135068 1137378 No. No, absolutely not.
1137549 1139141 We're going to, um,
1140069 1141104 have some dinner.
1141269 1142304 Eat.
1142429 1143862 I see.
1144189 1147898 Pity. I was going to invite you<br />over for a dinner I'm hosting.
1148749 1151583 I've purchased four lamb shanks
1151750 1156585 that I've been simmering<br />in a broth of red wine and rosemary.
1156950 1158622 That sounds so yummy, though.
1158710 1159710 Damn it.
1159790 1161985 It was actually Debbie's recipe.
1163470 1169307 I like to think she left behind her<br />recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,
1171231 1174701 but it was most likely<br />an unintentional oversight.
1180032 1182910 Well, here we go.
1184272 1185546 What?
1186632 1187826 I'm sorry?
1188912 1190709 I thought you said something.
1190992 1192790 - No.<br />- Nope, not us.
1193233 1194268 Okay.
1197193 1198831 Have fun.
1202353 1203911 Oh, fuck me.
1204833 1206631 A guy who rents a house this big
1206794 1209911 must be making up for something<br />pretty small, I'd say.
1210074 1212463 No, no. No, I've seen his dick.<br />It's pretty great.
1212634 1214431 Well, I tried.
1215874 1217148 - Hey!<br />- Hey!
1217314 1218570 - Hey!<br />- How are you doing, beautiful?
1218594 1221029 - Good, good. Really fancy.<br />- Very nice house, Tony Stark.
1221195 1223275 Should we give<br />our drink orders to Jarvis?
1223715 1226468 No, I got the Tony Stark part,<br />but then you went full nerd on me.
1226635 1228211 I kind of lost you,<br />but please do come in.
1228235 1229235 All right.
1229315 1230384 - Thanks, Cap.<br />- Hi, guys!
1230475 1231475 What's up?
1231555 1235026 Boy, could sleep four<br />on that couch. Look at that.
1235116 1236834 Oh, hello, friends.
1236996 1240511 Hey, let me introduce you to my date.<br />This is Sarah.
1240676 1242667 Sarah is head of company accounting<br />at our office.
1242836 1244076 Well, corporate communications.
1244156 1247069 And she's also British,<br />which means she's smart as shit.
1247277 1248949 - I'm Irish.<br />- Okay? Same island.
1249117 1250232 Well, it's really not.
1250317 1251453 - Nice to meet you. Hi.<br />- Nice to meet you, too.
1251477 1252592 - I'm Max.<br />- Annie.
1252677 1255669 So, you can't always judge a book<br />by its past covers, can you?
1255837 1257873 - Mmm.<br />- Almost a saying.
1258077 1259197 - Here you go.<br />- Hey, Brooks.
1259317 1260813 - Cheers.<br />- We didn't know if you had any games,
1260837 1263068 so we thought we'd bring you<br />a few of our favorites.
1263238 1264751 Hey, look at that.
1265198 1266790 Whoa!
1266878 1268238 - Huh.<br />- The poor games.
1268278 1270189 I told you we're taking it up a notch.
1270358 1273316 The game that we're<br />gonna play tonight is so epic
1273478 1275834 that we don't need a board,<br />and we do not need pieces.
1275999 1277695 Still didn't need to throw them<br />across the room.
1277719 1278947 I was being theatrical.
1279119 1280871 Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?
1281039 1282074 A what?
1282159 1284175 It's when rich people<br />pay poor people to fight each other...
1284199 1286695 Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.<br />Stop with the fight club, okay?
1286719 1287993 - It's nonsense.<br />- No.
1288159 1289559 Ryan believes everything he reads.
1289720 1291233 Thank you.
1291400 1293675 So, what are we playing?
1296200 1300830 In the next hour, someone in this room<br />is going to be taken.
1301040 1303999 And it's gonna be up to you to find them<br />before they are murdered.
1304161 1306117 Oh! It's a murder mystery party.
1306281 1308033 Not just any murder mystery.
1308201 1309737 I found this company.<br />They do it super real.
1309761 1310830 They use legit actors.
1310921 1313993 You're not gonna know<br />what's real and what's fake.
1314161 1316357 - Fun!<br />- But that's not all
1316522 1320674 because whoever finds the victim<br />wins the grand prize.
1322482 1324074 The keys to the Stingray.
1324242 1325834 - What?<br />- Wow.
1326002 1327640 Just the keys?
1328322 1329755 No, Ryan, the whole car.
1329923 1332039 Oh, yes! Oh, man!
1332243 1333859 You're so lucky I brought you<br />to this game night
1333883 1335953 - and not one of Max and Annie's.<br />- Hey!
1336163 1338723 - No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.<br />- Oh.
1338923 1341198 You're not gonna actually<br />give away your car?
1341363 1342796 Oh, it's just a tax write-off.
1343003 1345313 And the Audi, it's more practical.
1345764 1347197 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
1347364 1349434 Okay. How do we start?
1349604 1351356 We just wait for it to begin.
1351524 1354038 Maybe play a drinking game<br />to pass the time?
1354204 1356160 This group does not play drinking games.
1356324 1358361 Tonight we do, Max.
1359285 1360821 - Oh! "Never Have I Ever."<br />- Good one!
1360845 1362245 Can you believe this guy?
1362285 1364196 Yeah, he's ridiculous.
1364365 1365844 Beautiful house, though.
1366005 1367597 Good champagne.
1371606 1373358 Here we go.
1374766 1377041 Yup. We're at the house.
1377486 1379920 We'll let you know when we have him.
1395567 1397398 Jesus Christ!
1397567 1399286 What's with that knife?
1399488 1401080 It's for the cheese.
1401248 1403808 Okay, all right. Just, you know,
1403968 1406277 really aggressive way to carry a knife.
1407128 1408128 Oh, no, I've got one.
1408288 1411803 Never have I ever<br />connected my work computer
1411968 1415359 to the projector in the conference room<br />when it was open on a WebMD page
1415529 1416598 for chlamydia symptoms.
1416769 1417804 That's not cool!
1417969 1419084 Drink!
1419249 1421126 Just for the record,<br />I did not have chlamydia.
1421289 1424122 It was pubic dermatitis. You get it<br />from not washing your crotch, so...
1424289 1425465 - Okay.<br />- Good for you.
1425489 1427560 I... I like her.
1427970 1429986 And, listen, you're not supposed<br />to single people out in this game.
1430010 1432160 It's supposed to be generic things, like
1432330 1434082 "Never have I ever slept<br />with a celebrity."
1434250 1436081 Oh, I didn't know. Okay.
1436170 1437285 Whoops.
1437370 1438439 - Mmm?<br />- Ooh.
1441651 1442686 What?
1442771 1444568 You slept with a celebrity?
1444731 1447325 No, I was taking a drink<br />separate from the game.
1447411 1448547 - That was bad timing.<br />- Mmm.
1448571 1450171 I see how you would think, but it's not.
1450291 1453052 Well, then why are you breathing<br />like you just got off the elliptical?
1453491 1455164 I'm not. I'm...
1455612 1457887 Come on, babe.<br />Whose turn is it?
1458012 1460321 Uh, it's Max. Max, it's your turn. Huh?
1460492 1462369 I'm not playing a drinking game.<br />Who was it?
1462532 1463572 What's the deal with that?
1463612 1464788 They've been together<br />since middle school.
1464812 1465868 It's somebody else's turn.
1465892 1466892 - Oh. Oh!<br />- Yeah!
1467012 1469029 How could you possibly<br />have had sex with a celebrity
1469053 1470930 when we've only had sex with each other?
1471093 1473349 Please, can you not make this<br />one of your things right now?
1473373 1474533 How is this one of my things?
1475333 1478211 Yeah, Brooks, this is why<br />we don't play drinking games.
1481333 1483086 It looks like the game is afoot.
1483174 1484448 Oh!
1484574 1486053 Thank you, God!
1486214 1488170 Oh, boy. Let's buckle up, huh?
1490374 1491887 Brooks Davis?
1492174 1493209 Yes.
1493294 1494886 - Oh, shit.<br />- Ooh!
1495054 1496488 This is good.
1497175 1499006 Agent Henderson.
1499815 1500850 FBI.
1501015 1503734 Sunglasses at night. It's legit.
1503895 1504964 Sit down, please.
1506215 1507728 I'll get right to the point.
1507895 1512651 The Bureau has been tracking a ring<br />of violent kidnappers
1512816 1514932 in this very neighborhood.
1515656 1519012 And we have reason to believe<br />that one of you
1520296 1521809 may be their next victim.
1523817 1525033 That's terrible news.
1525057 1528333 Contained within these dossiers
1528537 1532132 are the clues you will require<br />to find the kidnappers.
1532297 1534253 You'd like for us to do that, yeah?
1534817 1536737 The Bureau's...<br />What's the Bureau's role in this?
1536817 1538714 Maybe you guys could take my wife<br />in for questioning
1538738 1540474 because, apparently, she got a<br />secret life I don't know nothing about.
1540498 1542773 - Baby, this is...<br />- Shut up, all of you!
1542858 1544007 Wow.
1545578 1547296 It's not a joke.
1547458 1550177 You people are in real danger,<br />and you're running out of time.
1550338 1554093 And I, Agent Henderson,<br />will not stand idly by
1554259 1558377 while innocent civilians<br />are slaughtered on my watch.
1558539 1559795 I told you<br />this is gonna be great.
1559819 1561650 - It's so good!<br />- So good.
1561859 1562995 But, uh, before we get started,
1563019 1565301 I'm required to ask if any of you<br />have any food allergies.
1565740 1566775 Peanuts?
1567780 1568929 Who the hell are you?
1569020 1570089 Oh!
1570180 1571916 Now wait a second.<br />I know your method and all,
1571940 1574236 but you can't just come in here<br />and break the door.
1574260 1576296 I do not mind this game.
1576500 1578058 Are you crazy?
1593062 1594814 It's very well done.
1596102 1597251 No!
1597942 1599534 That is a strong table.
1600702 1602135 Oh, watch out! He's packing heat!
1602302 1603337 Hell no!
1608863 1610819 Oh! Oh!
1634385 1635420 Come on!
1648666 1651180 You're just making this<br />harder on yourself!
1654266 1655266 Oh, shit!
1656186 1658620 Guys, make sure you<br />get a piece of this cheese. It's just...
1658786 1661096 - Cut me one.<br />- Try it with the quince.
1668827 1670226 Oh, my God!
1670827 1671862 Now he's back.
1671947 1673283 Stop fighting, asshole!
1673307 1674422 Help me! This isn't...
1674507 1676863 The Independent Spirit Award goes to...
1677108 1678828 Let's go!
1679068 1680068 Bye-bye!
1680228 1681786 First one that follows us gets shot!
1681988 1683626 Okay, roger that. You drive safe.
1683828 1685420 Come on, motherfucker!
1685828 1687978 - That was amazing.<br />- Really good.
1688148 1689468 - That was really good.<br />- Wow.
1689749 1693742 Mmm. No, there's something about this<br />that just doesn't feel right.
1694269 1696544 How could you cheat on me<br />with a celebrity?
1696709 1697744 I didn't cheat on you.
1697909 1700423 It was before we got married<br />when we took that break.
1700589 1702820 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1702990 1704126 I've been living in The Matrix.
1704150 1707142 Agent Henderson,<br />you just gonna keep lying there?
1707350 1708430 Is any of this real?
1708510 1710102 Well, don't kick him!
1710710 1712750 - Stop.<br />- He's a regular Daniel Day-Lewis.
1712870 1713966 I thought we both agreed
1713990 1716869 that we wouldn't hook up<br />with anybody else during that break.
1717071 1719471 Yeah, but then you went<br />and got a hand job from Karen Waller.
1719551 1721367 - No, don't do that.<br />- Boop! Boop! Boop!
1721391 1723268 Because it was over the pants,<br />all right?
1723431 1726787 It was, and it hurt. It was very dry,<br />and I didn't climax.
1726951 1728607 Just admit it.<br />You guys did more than that.
1728631 1730543 Don't turn this around on me.<br />Do not do that.
1730752 1731912 Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!
1732232 1733288 Damn it, they got the jump on us.
1733312 1734312 - Come on.<br />- Shit, Kev!
1734392 1735392 Come on now!
1735472 1737288 All right. Here's the first clue.<br />Looks like a riddle.
1737312 1738791 "With shiny fangs..."
1738952 1740590 "My bloodless bite..."
1740752 1743550 "Will bring together<br />what's mostly white."
1743712 1745510 Donald Trump.
1745673 1749461 "Bloodless bite." It's not a vampire.<br />Um...
1749633 1750952 I'll just Google it.
1751113 1752353 It's so inconsistent, isn't it?
1752393 1754193 I mean, they stage<br />this super realistic fight.
1754313 1757146 They give us an FBI dossier<br />but with riddles.
1757313 1759250 It's like, let's pick a tone.<br />Let's stick with it.
1759274 1761170 But that's the game.<br />You wanna win this car or not?
1761194 1762593 Yeah, yeah. More than anything,
1762754 1764354 but I feel like Brooks is setting me up.
1764434 1765794 Do you get that feeling? You know,
1765954 1769424 that this is some game<br />where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?
1771194 1772628 Mmm-hmm.
1773515 1775665 Well, let's not play by his rules.
1777075 1778731 "My bloodless bite, my bloodless,<br />bloodless bite.
1778755 1780711 "Bloodless bite, bloodless bite,<br />bloodless bite."
1780875 1783105 Can you stop chanting "bloodless bite"?<br />It's just...
1783675 1785667 - Trying to think.<br />- Yeah.
1786196 1788710 Oh, shit!
1789236 1791386 Max and Annie must have figured it out.
1791556 1793751 Right. We need to find an advantage.
1794116 1797552 Advantage, advantage, advantage...
1797836 1798836 Brooks' wallet?
1798996 1801147 You think we should steal<br />all of his shit!
1801717 1802717 No.
1807197 1809188 Hi, yeah. I lost my credit card.
1809277 1811213 I was wondering if you could tell me<br />what the last few charges I made were.
1811237 1812306 What are you doing?
1812477 1814214 If we can find out the name<br />of the murder mystery place he used,
1814238 1816454 we can go to their office and<br />pay them off to give us the final clue.
1816478 1817877 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1818038 1822156 You're, like, a double threat.<br />Brains and you're British.
1823158 1824307 Thanks.
1824518 1829912 Okay. What has shiny fangs<br />that bites white things together?
1830079 1831079 A stapler!
1831239 1833230 And the white things are paper.
1833399 1836311 Yes! You are so smart and unfaithful!
1836559 1837594 Oh, there it is.
1837759 1838874 Yes!
1839999 1841718 Look at that.
1841880 1843677 - Flash drive.<br />- Put it in the desktop.
1846000 1847000 Okay.
1847840 1848909 Another riddle.
1849080 1852277 "I'm brown and old by day,<br />white and young by night.
1852440 1853440 "My eyes are glass.
1853600 1855478 "I have nine faces but no head.
1855641 1857359 "I sing to the sky but have no voice.
1857521 1860115 "I'm everywhere and nowhere."
1861841 1863718 What the fuck is that?
1865081 1866400 I mean, how cool are we?
1866601 1868058 - Very, very cool. We are very cool.<br />- Right?
1868082 1871438 You're the cool one. You know,<br />tracking the phone is just a great idea.
1871602 1872876 Still on Route 18, huh?
1873042 1875202 We're catching up to them.<br />Here we come, Brooksie.
1875242 1877915 Can you imagine the look on his face<br />when we find him so fast?
1878082 1881472 You know, baby, I can feel my sperm<br />already coming back to life.
1881642 1882792 - Perfect.<br />- Yeah.
1882963 1886114 So we'll win your brother's car,<br />and then we'll go make a baby in it.
1886283 1888194 - Yeah! We'll make him watch us. Huh?<br />- Yeah.
1889163 1891074 - I don't wanna do that.<br />- No, me neither.
1891243 1892619 - Sorry, don't know why I said that.<br />- I'm not into that.
1892643 1894201 - Not a great idea.<br />- Okay.
1894363 1895591 Okay, great. Thank you.
1895804 1897180 All right, I got the name<br />and the address of the games company.
1897204 1898398 - Let's go.<br />- Yes!
1898564 1901476 All we have to do now,<br />figure out what "bloodless bite" means.
1902044 1903272 No, we don't. That's why...
1904764 1907198 - Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.<br />- Doesn't matter. Let's go.
1907364 1908922 How you gonna be old and young?
1909084 1910837 - That doesn't make sense.<br />- I know.
1911005 1913519 Guys, hey, how's it goin'?
1913685 1916802 I just wanted to wish you<br />the best of luck tonight. Bye.
1919765 1920959 - No.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1921165 1922484 What are... What are you doing?
1922645 1924079 Just being a dick.
1924206 1926436 Oh!
1926526 1928622 - Don't kick him, Ryan!<br />- He's such a good actor!
1928646 1929681 Ryan!
1929766 1932155 God damn it!
1933286 1935726 Baby, hand me those matches.<br />I'm about to burn this door down.
1935886 1938423 You're gonna light a fire in<br />a windowless room that we're trapped in?
1938447 1941063 You slept with Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br />He talked to you about flames?
1941087 1942156 What about that?
1956568 1958365 Where could he be?
1958768 1961236 His phone stopped right here, huh?
1963688 1964917 - Hear that?<br />- Yeah.
1966809 1967878 Ugh.
1968129 1969198 Found it!
1969369 1970889 He must've known we were tracking him.
1971009 1972522 Well, they outsmarted us.
1974529 1975529 Hang on.
1977449 1979088 Isn't that one of the actors?
1979490 1981560 Guess they're not<br />so smart after all, huh?
1981770 1984648 Guess not. We are nailing this!
1985850 1987026 Why are we crouching?
1987050 1989245 I don't know. It feels right.
1993011 1994683 Oh, it's horrible in here.
1994851 1997570 - Yeah, it's sticky. Shoes are shot.<br />- Ugh.
1998211 2000107 Ooh. There he is. There he is.<br />Don't let him see you. Come on.
2000131 2001450 Sit down right here.
2001611 2003886 Bartender, sir,<br />can I ask you a question?
2003971 2005040 Um...
2005291 2006407 You, um...
2006492 2008687 You didn't happen to see a fellow<br />brought in here,
2008852 2010080 looks a little bit like me,
2010252 2012482 but he's got a little bit<br />of a sharper chin
2012652 2013926 and higher cheekbones?
2014092 2015764 So a better-looking guy?
2016132 2017963 No, well, I wouldn't call it that.
2018212 2019691 I didn't see nothing.
2021173 2022891 - Oh, boy. You hear that?<br />- Huh. Yeah.
2023053 2024429 That double negative?<br />"Didn't see nothing"?
2024453 2026229 - It's a little forced, right?<br />- Yeah, I think he's in on it.
2026253 2027669 - 'Course he is.<br />- Look at those tats.
2027693 2029411 So fresh, probably fake.
2029973 2032168 Tell you what.<br />Let's give him a test, okay?
2032333 2035110 Let's order a couple of drinks that only<br />a real bartender would know how to make.
2035134 2036169 Oh, smart! Yes.
2036254 2037687 - Sir! Excuse me. Hi.<br />- Barkeep.
2037854 2039294 Totally forgot to order drinks.
2039414 2040529 Yes, uh...
2041134 2043932 Could I please have a vodka tonic?
2045734 2046769 Well done, honey.
2046934 2049210 I'm gonna have a Harvey Wallbanger.
2049375 2051331 Okay? Appreciate it.
2051935 2053493 Jesus! Did you see that look?
2053655 2054831 Guy doesn't know what's going on.
2054855 2055924 Think you stumped him.
2056095 2057972 Regional theater hack.
2058055 2059454 Huh?
2059935 2062370 - Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?<br />- Yeah.
2062536 2063712 It's nice to get out of the house.
2063736 2066576 You know, we're not gonna be able<br />to do stuff like this if we have kids.
2066616 2067685 - What?<br />- Yeah.
2067776 2069016 - Why not?<br />- Well, I don't know.
2069136 2070752 I was thinking about it.<br />Remember Dan and Linda?
2070776 2072736 Remember how much time<br />we used to spend with them?
2072896 2075695 Just tons of fun.<br />And then they had those twins.
2075857 2077210 Boom! Off the grid, right?
2077417 2079487 Last time we saw them<br />was their Christmas card
2079577 2080617 with the wonky kids on it.
2080737 2083535 Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.<br />They look so happy.
2083617 2084811 But you know what I mean.
2085857 2087737 - We don't see them...<br />- Vodka tonic.
2087977 2089457 Harvey Wallbanger.
2089618 2090738 - Appreciate it.<br />- Thank you.
2090898 2092377 Cheers.
2095258 2096327 Did he get it right?
2096658 2098874 Huh. I do not know. I realized I've<br />never had one of these,
2098898 2101128 but that is a tasty drink.<br />It's kind of tart.
2101298 2103130 You wanna try it? Oh! Honey!
2103299 2104493 Honey! There's Brooks!
2104659 2107127 Brooks is here. Brooks is here.<br />We're about to win this thing!
2107299 2109449 - Yes, yes!<br />- Look who came in here.
2109659 2111968 Oh! No! I think he made us.
2112139 2113875 So what? It's over.<br />What, are they gonna try to stop us?
2113899 2115218 - Let's go.<br />- Yeah, probably.
2115379 2118258 But that's why I brought this.
2118460 2120076 Jesus Christ, honey!<br />Where did you get a gun?
2120100 2122330 No, no, that's the fake gun<br />from Brooks' fight.
2122500 2124855 - Oh, yeah. Boy, that looks real.<br />- Yeah, well, you know...
2124940 2126476 - Brooks never spares any expense.<br />- Look at that.
2126500 2128889 - Yeah, that's true.<br />- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?
2129060 2130095 Why? What are you doing?
2130221 2131221 Lead?
2131301 2133417 Any of you fucking pricks move,
2133581 2137176 and I'll execute every motherfucking<br />last one of you!
2137261 2138376 Very nice, honey.
2138461 2140292 Pulp Fiction, anybody?<br />Right? It's a classic.
2140381 2141609 We love films.
2141701 2143498 Okay, what the fuck is this shit?
2143581 2145758 Well, you're gonna hand over the keys<br />'cause we're gonna take my brother.
2145782 2146817 Bullshit.
2146902 2150053 Oh! You know what's bullshit<br />is your bald, ugly face.
2150142 2152638 Uh-uh. No, that's personal.<br />Come on, honey, let's just keep it fun.
2152662 2154937 All right, I'm sorry I called you bald,<br />you little bitch!
2155022 2156580 Well, that's, again, you know...
2156662 2158893 - Let the gun do the talking. Come on.<br />- Okay. Ah!
2159023 2160741 On your knees. Hands in the air.
2160903 2162519 - Good. Good. Great.<br />- Heads on the ground. Eyes closed.
2162543 2164023 That's it. Get them up, reach for it.
2164103 2165839 - Hands up! That's right.<br />- There we go.
2165863 2167623 - All right, hands in the air!<br />- Get them up!
2167783 2169136 - Yep.<br />- Yo, where's my head go?
2169343 2170571 - Down.<br />- On the floor.
2170743 2171859 Just rest it.
2171944 2173240 How am I supposed<br />to put my hands in the air
2173264 2174600 - with my head on the ground?<br />- Fucking exactly.
2174624 2176262 I did have the same question.
2177624 2180184 Child's pose?<br />Do you guys know child's pose?
2180344 2181464 Fuck is a child's pose, man?
2181544 2182600 You've never done yoga?
2182624 2183664 - Okay, wow.<br />- No?
2185064 2186225 - Cover me.<br />- Show them, baby.
2186305 2188121 - All right. Arms out.<br />- Here she comes.
2188145 2189863 Knees apart if you have back problems.
2189945 2191105 And if you're doing it right,
2191185 2194097 you're really gonna feel that<br />lumbar opening up back there.
2194185 2195281 Let's put your head down.
2195305 2198183 Come on. I don't wanna have to use this.<br />Okay?
2198425 2199859 Okay.
2200466 2201899 Can't you just tell me who it was?
2201986 2205023 I know you, Kev. If I tell you,<br />you'll just obsess about it even more.
2205106 2206619 Okay, fine. How about this?
2206706 2208617 If I guess it right, you tell me.
2208706 2209775 Fine.
2209866 2210866 Was it an actor?
2211026 2212175 Yes. That tower is unstable.
2212346 2214383 I'm not stable! Was he over 40?
2214547 2215547 Yes. Be careful.
2215707 2217823 Okay. American?
2217987 2219102 Yes.
2221027 2222745 It's Tommy Lee Jones.
2223227 2224626 What? Ew. No.
2226307 2228868 Denzel? Was it Denzel?<br />Denzel Washington?
2229028 2231223 It wasn't, unfortunately.
2231388 2232582 Thank God.
2234068 2235342 Um... Be careful.
2235508 2237146 Oh! Sweet freedom.
2237228 2238866 Oh, my God!
2238948 2241309 You see, this dumbass thought<br />he can keep us locked in here.
2241429 2244227 But guess what?<br />You can't lock us in here!
2244429 2246465 You see, hate put us in here!
2246629 2248938 - Okay, baby.<br />- But love is gonna bust us out!
2249109 2250542 - Ahh!<br />- Oh, my God!
2252829 2253864 Oh, my God!
2254029 2255463 Kev! Kev, are you okay?
2255630 2257222 Baby, I fell down.
2265630 2267029 There it is.
2267670 2271186 Yes, I'm so glad I invited you tonight!
2271271 2272420 Yeah, me, too.
2272591 2275822 I usually bring these girls<br />I wanna sleep with, and they just suck!
2275991 2278425 You're like a breath of fresh air.
2278511 2280024 Aw, thanks.
2280191 2282552 I usually go out with men<br />I find interesting and non-stupid,
2282632 2284145 so this is a bit new for me, too.
2284232 2285426 Whoa!
2285672 2286672 Are we cool?
2286872 2288385 Did I say something wrong?
2288552 2289552 No.
2289632 2292146 No, I mean I was wondering why you<br />asked me along tonight,
2292352 2294661 and now I know you<br />just needed a ringer, so...
2295032 2297706 Oh, did you... You thought<br />this was a date? I didn't...
2297913 2301144 No, actually.<br />Well, I was hoping it wasn't.
2301593 2303311 Then why are you wearing lipstick?
2303473 2304667 - I'm not.<br />- Yeah, you are.
2304833 2306027 What are you...
2306193 2307512 You can't touch a girl's mouth.
2307673 2309489 Why? Are you scared I'm<br />gonna smear your lipstick...
2309513 2311186 Oh, my God! You bit me!
2311354 2312450 Yeah, and I'll bite you again.
2312474 2313509 There's lipstick on here.
2313674 2315187 Oh, shut up!
2315354 2317231 I see you wiping off that date lipstick!
2319194 2320343 Ow!
2320434 2322470 That really hurt a little bit.
2323755 2325074 Hello?
2325315 2326873 Hello?
2334475 2335703 Um, excuse me?
2340636 2342149 Yeah, okay.
2342956 2344025 Um...
2344116 2345116 Hello?
2348956 2350947 Oh, oh! Oh, shit!
2353637 2354706 Holy shit!
2355637 2356752 God!
2357197 2358717 Come on! Bloody hell!
2358877 2360026 - What?<br />- Phew!
2360357 2363315 You guys scared me so bad.<br />What are you doing?
2363477 2364705 What the fuck is that?
2365518 2367236 Oh. Well, I just came from
2367318 2369334 a six-hour murder mystery<br />where I played the corpse.
2369358 2371918 I must've dozed off<br />before I had a chance to clean up.
2371998 2374148 Well, you scared the shit out of us.
2374238 2375353 Really? Thank you.
2375438 2377478 Actually that means a lot<br />'cause I do my own makeup.
2377598 2379954 What kind of party<br />has a pregnant corpse?
2380119 2383236 No, I'm actually pregnant.<br />This isn't part of it. This is just...
2383319 2384354 Oh!
2384439 2385508 - Congrats.<br />- Thank you!
2387079 2389468 Um, we want you<br />to give us the final clue
2389559 2392597 to the murder mystery<br />Brooks Davis ordered.
2392680 2394591 Oh, my gosh.<br />But that would ruin the fun.
2394680 2397353 We don't want the fun.<br />We just wanna win.
2397440 2399112 Yeah, I can't do that.
2410641 2412677 This change your mind?
2417561 2418710 No.
2420122 2421475 Don't...
2421882 2424032 What about this?
2432202 2433476 Mmm.
2434563 2435996 You drive a hard bargain. Okay.
2436163 2438472 Let's take it up a notch.
2451764 2455439 I was hoping I wasn't<br />gonna have to dig this deep, but okay.
2455604 2457674 Final offer.
2464445 2467881 You know what? It doesn't matter<br />how slowly you slide it over!
2468085 2470315 Okay? It's $17! How much do you want?
2471165 2473360 - Um, I don't know. Probably $100.<br />- Give her $100.
2473765 2475279 I don't have a hundred.
2476166 2478122 How much have you got?
2478766 2479881 $17.
2480126 2481923 $17?
2483046 2484559 You brought $17 out?
2487086 2488917 Nice!
2489287 2490402 - Thank you!<br />- Cool.
2490887 2492843 So you're just gonna keep it. I got you.
2493567 2495080 Stay back!
2495167 2497183 Hey, buddy, can you just give us<br />the answer to the second riddle,
2497207 2498435 'cause we're way behind.
2498527 2499846 Don't you get it?
2499927 2501599 That was not supposed to happen.
2503688 2505997 Oh, what now? You guys already<br />did the breaking-in thing.
2506088 2508522 Shut up! And get on the floor,<br />all of you!
2508808 2509877 Whoa!
2509968 2511959 Ron, you okay?
2512088 2513999 No, Nathan, I'm not okay.
2514088 2516728 Two guys came in here and attacked me.
2516809 2518447 - Oh, my God.<br />- I know!
2518529 2521566 And I quit Disney Cruises<br />for this bullshit.
2523849 2525425 We can check,<br />but that doesn't make any sense.
2525449 2526677 I'm not wearing a jacket.
2526849 2529238 Maybe it means, like a book jacket.
2529409 2531844 Why would a book have a jacket?
2533730 2534730 Murder We Wrote.
2534850 2536266 Glenda, something terrible has happened.
2536290 2537290 What?
2537410 2538826 Nathan and I<br />showed up for the takeaway,
2538850 2540568 and Ron had been attacked.
2540730 2542050 Where? At the Brooks Davis house?
2542130 2543250 - Yes.<br />- Huh?
2543290 2544291 What?
2545411 2546890 Is everyone okay?
2547051 2548769 No, no. I'm not okay, Glenda!
2548931 2552287 I have a throbbing headache,<br />and they took the host!
2552451 2554123 - Who took him?<br />- Kidnappers!
2554291 2556885 Real ones! Dangerous fucking criminals!
2567372 2570372 I'm packed and I'm holding<br />I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden
2570452 2571601 She lives for me
2571773 2573047 - Sing into the mic.<br />- Jesus!
2573133 2574168 No.
2574253 2577848 Her own motivation<br />She goes round, and she goes down on me
2578013 2579048 And you, Tats?
2579213 2581966 You got something to say? No? Boop.
2582133 2584363 Coming over you<br />Keep on smiling, what we go through
2584813 2587453 One stop to the rhythm that divides you
2587614 2590731 I see you eyeing that, Ponytail.<br />Not on my watch!
2590814 2592691 Bingo! Bingo! I got them, baby.<br />Let's do this.
2592854 2595209 Yes! Okay.
2596654 2598167 Hey, hey, Brooks!
2598334 2600451 - Guess who it is!<br />- Oh!
2600615 2603448 Ready? Hello!
2603735 2605071 - Look at that face!<br />- Oh, shit.
2605095 2606130 That is priceless!
2606215 2607791 You did not expect us this early,<br />did you?
2607815 2610045 I've gotta capture this moment.<br />Honey, get in there.
2610215 2612046 We'll take a quick little selfie here
2612215 2614605 and send it off to the losers.<br />One, two, three.
2614776 2616050 Cheese!
2616136 2617330 Ha!
2617416 2618512 Perfect. Oh, speak of the devil.
2618536 2620652 There's Ryan now,<br />probably calling begging for help.
2620736 2621736 - Ugh!<br />- Ignore.
2621816 2623374 This is not a game, Max!
2624056 2626969 Jesus! Guys, it's a wrap in here, okay?
2627377 2628377 Show's over!
2628457 2630433 Listen, I'm not a venture capitalist.<br />I'm a smuggler!
2630457 2633255 - A smuggler?<br />- Yeah, I made a mistake.
2633337 2634553 I sold the Bulgarian's egg<br />to a different guy.
2634577 2636353 And I have to get it back to him,<br />or he's gonna kill me!
2636377 2639217 "The Bulgarian's egg"? Wasn't that<br />the third Harry Potter book? Come on.
2639337 2641818 Wait, I'm confused. So, this isn't<br />the end of this whole thing?
2641938 2643053 No, it is the end, okay?
2643218 2644936 You said, whoever catches you<br />gets the car.
2645098 2647248 We found you, we get the car. Game over.
2647418 2649534 No! I'm telling you! This is all real!
2649898 2651394 The shitty actors are real?<br />Come on.
2651418 2653258 How about that ridiculous fight?<br />Was that real?
2653378 2654778 Is this gun real?
2654859 2655859 Oh, no, Annie!
2655939 2658214 Oh, no. Oh, no. Bang, bang.
2660379 2661379 Ow!
2669740 2670775 Blood!
2670940 2673534 Oh, my God! I shot you!
2673700 2675179 You fucking shot me!
2675340 2676932 Cut me loose before we all get shot!
2677140 2678140 Come on, untie me!
2678460 2679700 - Get me out of here!<br />- Oh, God!
2681140 2682415 Help me. Help.
2682581 2683730 Oh, my God!
2683941 2686117 - Go out! Go, go, go!<br />- What the fuck did you do to me?
2686141 2687813 Come on, come on, come on.
2688261 2689933 - Hey!<br />- Where are the guns?
2692501 2693536 You shot me.
2693741 2695254 I know. I feel terrible.
2695421 2696758 - Come on, man!<br />- Go! Go, go!
2696782 2697878 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2697902 2698958 Come on, come on, come on!
2698982 2700358 - Oh, my God!<br />- Move your ass!
2700382 2702134 - Honey, get in!<br />- Go, go!
2702302 2703576 Go, go, go!
2704902 2706460 Holy shit!
2707702 2710536 Hold up! Hold up, motherfucker!
2711903 2714019 - God damn it!<br />- Man, come on!
2716063 2718159 Brooks, what the fuck<br />is going on with you? Start talking!
2718183 2720617 I've lied to you<br />and the family about what I do.
2720703 2723662 I buy and I sell illegal shit for people<br />in the black market.
2723744 2725018 Really? So you're a criminal?
2725104 2726424 Oh, my God! They're following us!
2728104 2729440 But I made a mistake,<br />because there's this guy.
2729464 2730520 They call him the Bulgarian.
2730544 2732853 He's got his fingers in all these pies<br />around the world.
2733024 2735015 - What kind of pies?<br />- Illegal pies, Max.
2735104 2737921 You know, the kind of pies that have<br />heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.
2737945 2739001 You know, all that kind of stuff.
2739025 2741778 But he just wanted me to help him<br />find this Fabergé egg.
2741865 2744220 Fuck that! Fabergé egg?
2744305 2745841 - Are you kidding me?<br />- No, I'm serious.
2745865 2746865 And I found it!
2746945 2749584 But then there was this other guy,<br />this Marlon Freeman.
2749665 2751736 He's willing to pay twice as much<br />for the same egg.
2751826 2753362 So what? So you screwed over<br />the Bulgarian guy
2753386 2754722 and those fellows behind us<br />work for him,
2754746 2756562 and they just happen to crash your<br />murder mystery party?
2756586 2758861 I know, right?<br />What are the odds of that?
2760346 2762186 - Oh, too close, too close!<br />- Careful, careful!
2763826 2765055 Watch out! Watch out!
2765147 2766147 Oh, oh!
2768827 2770055 - Shit!<br />- Sorry! You okay?
2770227 2771262 Yeah, I'm all right.
2771347 2773781 - We need to go to the cops now!<br />- Yeah, right now! Let's go!
2773947 2775163 - We can't go to the cops!<br />- Why?
2775187 2776587 The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.
2776627 2777742 On his face?
2779428 2780747 No, in the police department.
2780908 2782227 Look out!
2783628 2784981 Careful!
2789588 2790987 Oh, my God! This is insane!
2805429 2807705 If you call the cops,<br />I'll be dead before I get to jail.
2807870 2809446 Why don't we just get a hold<br />of this Marlon Freeman guy
2809470 2810606 and buy the egg back from him?
2810630 2812870 I couldn't find him if I wanted to.<br />That name's an alias.
2816750 2818342 - Gun, gun, gun! Duck!<br />- Oh, oh...
2828391 2830461 Okay, these guys are not stopping.<br />What do we do?
2830631 2833703 They're not gonna stop<br />until they get me.
2833871 2835783 I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this.
2835872 2836872 Oh, my God!
2837032 2839262 I'm sorry for a lot of things.
2841592 2844112 - Hey! What are you doing?<br />- What is he doing? What is he doing?
2844552 2846543 - I love you, Max!<br />- Brooks, don't be an idiot!
2849113 2850113 Stop the car!
2858873 2861307 - Shit! Go, go, go!<br />- Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
2864794 2867075 Fuck! What are we gonna do?<br />They're gonna kill my brother.
2867114 2868834 Oh, Annie, I feel faint.<br />I'm gonna pass out.
2868874 2870671 Oh, honey, we'll get you<br />to a hospital, okay?
2870834 2872108 No, no, no! No hospitals.
2872274 2873610 This is a gunshot wound,<br />they'll call the cops.
2873634 2874634 Shit, shit! Okay.
2874714 2877229 So we go to a mob doctor, right?
2878315 2879771 Do you know one of those, sweetheart?
2879795 2881513 - No.<br />- No.
2881675 2883595 What about a veterinarian<br />that works for the mob?
2883915 2885633 - You know one of those?<br />- No.
2885795 2887371 Come on. Why are you pitching<br />all the mob stuff?
2887395 2889512 - I think 'cause I'm losing my shit here!<br />- I get it.
2889676 2890756 You're gonna have to do it.
2890796 2891796 - What?<br />- Yup.
2891876 2893132 You're gonna have<br />to take the bullet out.
2893156 2894412 I don't wanna... I don't wanna do it.
2894436 2895652 You think I want you<br />to take the bullet out?
2895676 2898036 I've seen you try to cut a chicken.<br />We have no other option.
2898116 2900505 Oh, my God! This is so bad!
2900676 2902234 I hate game night!
2905837 2907197 Thank you!
2908757 2909757 Hey!
2909837 2911557 Oh, thank God.<br />Listen, Annie. It's all real.
2911597 2912597 Oh, no, I know.
2912677 2914269 Brooks is caught up in something and...
2914477 2915830 Okay, where are you guys?
2915917 2917574 We're all at Brooks'.<br />Waiting to talk to the cops.
2917598 2919828 No! No, no, no! Do not talk to the cops!
2919998 2921078 What? Why? What's going on?
2921238 2922558 - Are you guys okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2922638 2924788 We're fine. We're fine.<br />I shot Max, but he's fine.
2924878 2925878 What?
2925958 2927374 Look. We will meet you<br />back at our house.
2927398 2929238 Whatever you do,<br />do not tell the cops anything.
2929318 2931594 Brooks's life depends on it.
2936279 2937678 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2937879 2938994 Okay.
2939159 2940194 I got a bunch of stuff.
2940279 2941279 Yeah.
2941839 2944034 Pocket knife. Tweezers.
2944119 2945553 Sewing kit. Gauze.
2945680 2947256 Good, good. All right.<br />Wow, you did great!
2947280 2949714 Yeah.<br />And they didn't have rubbing alcohol.
2949880 2952678 And they don't sell hard liquor,<br />so I got you this lovely chard.
2952840 2954956 Good idea. Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.
2955120 2956997 What else did you get, huh?<br />More good stuff?
2957560 2959791 What is helpful in Country Living?
2959961 2963715 Oh, that's for later. There's a corn<br />chowder recipe. It looks really good.
2963881 2965841 - You love corn chowder, huh?<br />- Sweet. I do, yeah.
2965881 2967017 - That'll cheer you up.<br />- Thank you.
2967041 2968520 Okay. And then a squeaky toy.
2969041 2970076 - Huh.<br />- For your mouth.
2970241 2971241 - For the pain.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2971401 2973002 Okay. Well, hopefully I won't need this.
2973082 2974879 - Okay, let's see this bad boy.<br />- All right.
2975082 2976151 Yeah, careful.
2976322 2977960 - Okay.<br />- All right.
2979202 2980202 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
2980362 2981498 - We're gonna push past it.<br />- No problem. No problem.
2981522 2982778 - We're gonna get the bullet out.<br />- Let's just Google.
2982802 2984218 Honey, can you return the text later?
2984242 2986083 This is instructions<br />on how to remove a bullet.
2986923 2988619 - Oh, sorry.<br />- It's an alt-right militia website,
2988643 2990283 so I'm just gonna<br />ignore the racist stuff.
2990403 2991472 - Good. Good, good.<br />- Yeah?
2991683 2993116 Okay. "Step one, sterile gloves."
2993563 2994791 Check!
2994963 2996139 We're doing the best we can, right?
2996163 2997881 Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.
2998043 2999557 "Step two."
2999644 3002238 Um... Okay. "Disinfect wound."
3002444 3004400 Right, yeah.<br />That's gonna sting, isn't it?
3004484 3005883 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
3005964 3007283 - Let's do it.<br />- Okay?
3009164 3011359 That smarts, huh?
3011524 3013276 Yeah.
3013445 3015401 Gonna administer anesthetic.
3015565 3017701 - We don't have that.<br />- Just gonna skip that one. Okay.
3017725 3019445 "Step four,<br />apply pressure above the wound."
3019485 3021396 Here, you squeeze that there.
3021485 3022581 - I got it.<br />- Great. Thank you.
3022605 3025165 We're just gonna<br />make two tiny incisions...
3025245 3026821 - Oh, my God.<br />- On either side of the wound.
3026845 3029041 Easy-peasy. Huh?
3029326 3030520 This is fun, huh?
3030646 3032477 - Are you having fun?<br />- No.
3032606 3033675 Let's get the bullet.
3033766 3035182 - Okay. Here we go.<br />- Let's get in there and get it.
3035206 3037382 - Nice and small, nice and small, baby.<br />- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
3037406 3038475 Tiny, teeny.
3042247 3044556 That's not small. That's really big!
3044727 3045762 So big?
3045847 3047963 Way too big, baby.<br />It's a bullet, not a grapefruit.
3048047 3050263 I'm sorry! I'm sorry.<br />This is my first time. I don't know...
3050287 3051766 Oh, there's so much blood.
3053127 3056279 - No, no. Don't you start doing that.<br />- No, you're gonna make...
3059768 3060803 - I'm sorry.<br />- Stop it.
3060928 3062344 I'm looking at you,<br />and you're making me...
3062368 3063824 Well, don't look at me.<br />I won't look at it.
3063848 3065624 - Push through. Let's go.<br />- Okay. All right, okay.
3065648 3066744 - No more cutting.<br />- Oh, shit.
3066768 3067904 Just get the tweezers<br />and get the bullet out, baby.
3067928 3069157 Shit, shit, shit. Um...
3069249 3071365 - What? What happened?<br />- Phone went to sleep.
3071449 3072745 You gotta set it so that thing stays on.
3072769 3073985 - No. My phone doesn't do that.<br />- Sure it does.
3074009 3075385 Same phone as mine. Just change it.
3075409 3077745 Just gonna touch it with my nose<br />every 30 seconds. It's fine.
3077769 3079225 Don't be afraid of your phone.<br />Get in there, go to the settings,
3079249 3081985 go to "Display" and change the timing<br />so that it doesn't revert to sleep mode.
3082009 3083045 - Revert?<br />- Yeah.
3083130 3084786 What are you, Steve Jobs?<br />I'm not reverting anything. No.
3084810 3085906 No, I'm just<br />unafraid of my phone, honey.
3085930 3086930 It's so fucking simple.
3087410 3089128 Shh! Quiet. I know what I'm doing, okay?
3089330 3090524 Do you?
3090610 3091610 Yes.
3091810 3093562 - Here we go. Here we go.<br />- Here she goes.
3093730 3095209 You're like a dolphin.
3095370 3097089 All right. This part's gonna hurt.
3097251 3098400 I don't... I don't doubt it.
3098571 3099970 Okay, let's do this.
3100411 3101411 Okay.
3102571 3103765 Ooh... Oh, wait.
3104331 3105651 What is that?
3105691 3106691 You hear that?
3106811 3108324 What's that sound? What's that sound?
3108411 3109639 Is that the bullet?
3109811 3112087 - That's bone!<br />- What?
3112172 3113730 That's not right.
3114172 3118006 Okay. Um, what do the racists say<br />if you can't find the bullet?
3118092 3119508 Yeah, that's bone. You got the bone.
3119532 3121523 I'm looking at my bone. Look right here.
3121692 3124765 Max, did you get shot twice?
3127973 3129088 That's the exit wound.
3129613 3131126 Oh, it came out!
3131253 3132732 Yup. Nothing to remove.
3132893 3134093 The bullet has exited the arm.
3134213 3135469 Well, let's just sew<br />that sucker up, huh?
3135493 3136493 Yeah.
3138774 3141413 No, no. Honey, don't, don't look at...
3141494 3142529 Stop it.
3144934 3146003 I'm sorry.
3146334 3148950 Now, the Bulgarian's guys have Brooks,<br />and the only way to save him
3148974 3151204 is to get that egg<br />from this Marlon Freeman guy.
3151295 3153889 I can't believe your brother's been<br />lying to us this whole time.
3153975 3155693 He's even cooler than we thought.
3155775 3158164 Honey, I think you sewed my arm<br />to my sleeve.
3158255 3160431 I didn't even know<br />Morgan Freeman collected Fabergé eggs.
3160455 3162252 Aren't those worth millions of dollars?
3162335 3164291 It's Marlon Freeman,<br />but that's just an alias.
3164375 3166512 Somehow, we gotta find out<br />his real name, find out his address.
3166536 3168686 - Police computer.<br />- What do you mean?
3168776 3170846 I once dated this girl<br />whose father was a cop.
3170936 3172892 She showed me her dad's police computer.
3172976 3175774 It has a database with<br />every known alias on it.
3175856 3178495 I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'<br />real name on it.
3178576 3181193 So, if we called her up, would she<br />let you go on her dad's computer?
3181217 3183526 No. No. No way! That ended badly.
3183817 3186657 So how are we gonna get into a police<br />computer without the cops knowing?
3186697 3188073 - Billy Bob Thornton!<br />- What?
3188097 3190133 - What?<br />- You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?
3190217 3194575 Hang on. Hang on. I know<br />where we can get on a police computer.
3195698 3197928 - Hey!<br />- Gary!
3198298 3199617 Goodness.
3200298 3202254 To what do<br />Bastian and I owe the pleasure?
3202418 3203817 Well, we were all just talking,
3203978 3206732 and we realized<br />we haven't had a game night in ages,
3206899 3208457 just the seven of us.
3208539 3209539 So...
3209619 3211575 I thought you were going<br />to your brother's house.
3211659 3212808 I never said that.
3212899 3215015 Come on, Gare Bear.<br />Live a little! It's the weekend!
3215099 3218216 We were just saying how you were always<br />better at games than Debbie was.
3218299 3220495 I'll thank you<br />not to besmirch my ex-wife.
3220940 3222419 That woman is an angel.
3222500 3226732 Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games<br />than you.
3227300 3233296 I will admit I have eagerly awaited<br />a visit such as this.
3239381 3240655 Where'd he go?
3241301 3242814 Do we follow him?
3242901 3244095 It seems like it.
3244181 3245819 - Ryan, you go first.<br />- I'm scared.
3252582 3255050 Help yourself to popped corn<br />with sea salt.
3255142 3256973 Oh! Oh!
3257862 3259341 Yummy, yummy.
3259862 3262457 I can't believe that you read my mind.<br />I was craving popcorn.
3262623 3264932 You have a framed photo of game night?
3265143 3268931 Doesn't everyone have photographs<br />of their best friends in their homes?
3270423 3272778 Of course. We do.
3273383 3275135 Max, uh, you wanna go first?
3275223 3277101 Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.
3277744 3278938 Oh. There's a loose one.
3279024 3281413 Always in the middle.<br />That's where you wanna go.
3281504 3282903 Can I use your john real quick?
3282984 3285373 Of course.<br />It's the end of the hall, next to our...
3288944 3290663 My bedroom.
3292145 3293180 Okay.
3315706 3317379 Oh, no, Gary.
3345029 3348544 So, Sarah, how long have you two<br />been a couple?
3349389 3351857 Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...
3351989 3355106 We work together. I wouldn't, um...<br />I wouldn't do that thing.
3355189 3360662 I see. I thought I detected a certain<br />chemistry between the two of you.
3360790 3363350 No. No way.
3363990 3366140 - No, that's not...<br />- Mmm. Mmm.
3366470 3370099 Then again, I'm not the best judge<br />of chemistry in the world.
3378071 3379220 Hmm.
3379831 3381503 Oh, because your wife left you.
3382071 3383299 Oh, shit.
3393032 3395182 Hello, Donald Anderton.
3404233 3406189 Oh!
3406873 3411389 So many possible moves.<br />I just don't know where to begin.
3413393 3414952 Um, maybe... Ooh...
3416274 3417890 - Decision-making.<br />- Come on, Annie. Just make up your mind.
3417914 3419472 - No!<br />- Please! No?
3421714 3424626 Yup, take your time.
3456717 3459515 Oh, Brooks. What have you<br />gotten yourself into?
3476798 3480871 Oh, shit. Where did you<br />come from, little guy?
3482238 3486118 Son of a bitch.<br />Hey! What are you, a vampire?
3486359 3488998 Oh, God. Oh, God.
3491879 3495235 Oh, my God. Has that got it?
3495399 3499279 No, that doesn't got it.<br />God damn it. Come on!
3503800 3504800 No!
3506680 3507680 I should go check on him.
3507760 3509160 I think he's fine.
3509400 3512393 - He cried out.<br />- Tell me about Debbie.
3515241 3516469 I beg your pardon.
3517201 3521672 Oh, just I... I never met her.<br />I'd love to hear all about her.
3532642 3534075 Where do I begin?
3534242 3536836 All right, you wanna take a bath?<br />We'll take a little bath.
3537002 3541793 There we go. Okay.<br />All right. Here we go.
3544043 3546876 There we go, huh? Huh?
3548363 3549557 Oh, it's so much worse.
3550243 3553680 Oh, God. And what did I do to this?<br />What the fuck is this thing?
3555204 3556319 Oh, Debbie.
3556404 3557598 Oh!
3565164 3567599 Okay. Fuck this.
3568205 3570036 Hey, guys, Gary was right.<br />It's awful late.
3570125 3572434 Let's get home, get to bed, huh?<br />Get out of his hair.
3572525 3574720 We haven't finished the game.<br />It's your turn, Max.
3574885 3576113 Oh, my turn, huh?
3576285 3578799 Okay, be careful now, Max.<br />Oh!
3578885 3580604 Well, game over. I went in a little hot.
3580766 3583678 - Why did you...<br />- Thanks! Good to see you, Gary.
3583846 3585962 When shall we play next?
3586046 3589038 Soon. We'll call you.
3593887 3596765 Bastian. Baby!
3598527 3602566 So, how are we supposed to get this egg<br />out of Donald Anderton's house?
3602647 3604285 I don't know. I'm gonna figure it out.
3605367 3608007 "Unknown Caller." Please don't be Gary.
3608088 3610682 - Hello?<br />- We have your brother.
3611568 3612717 Um...
3612808 3614321 Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,
3614408 3615624 and we're actually<br />on our way there right now.
3615648 3617384 We can do a swap, okay?<br />Please don't hurt Brooks.
3617408 3621322 Meet us on the East 4th Street bridge<br />at midnight. If you're late, he dies.
3621409 3622842 - Oh, my God.<br />- Um...
3623409 3625969 Boy, that's less than an hour from now.
3627409 3628478 Hello?
3628569 3631720 What's up with this guy's voice?<br />He sounds like a monster.
3631889 3633641 He's using a voice changer, Ryan.
3633729 3636039 He still sounds like a scary monster.
3639370 3643124 And we are here.
3643730 3644786 All right. You guys head home,
3644810 3646146 and I will call as soon<br />as I get the egg, all right?
3646170 3648321 What? Wait a second. Wait.<br />I'm going with you.
3648491 3650547 No, Annie. It could be very, very<br />dangerous in there, okay?
3650571 3652852 Listen, Brooks shouldn't have<br />dragged any of us into this,
3652891 3654627 but he is my brother,<br />and it's up to me to fix it.
3654651 3656721 No, bullshit!<br />We're all in this together!
3656811 3658927 No, no, no. Max is right.<br />You guys should go home,
3659091 3661286 but you and I are doing this.
3661451 3663807 Okay, what happens<br />if you guys don't make it out?
3663892 3666228 We don't come to game night because<br />we're dying to play charades and shit.
3666252 3667572 We come because we love you guys.
3667612 3669728 Honestly, this is<br />the best part of our week.
3669812 3672963 Mine, too. And I have<br />a lot of options on the weekend.
3673052 3675122 Wow. You guys...
3675252 3677244 Thank you. That's very nice.
3677973 3679770 Aw, good friends.
3680453 3683684 You should probably go, though, right?<br />I mean, you don't even know us.
3684093 3685651 Yeah, why are you still here?
3685733 3689089 Oh, I don't know.<br />I just got caught up in it.
3689173 3691165 Also, if I go home now,
3691254 3693070 and then I read in the newspaper<br />tomorrow that you all died,
3693094 3697053 I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,<br />so I'm gonna stick around.
3697814 3699850 You still read the newspaper?
3700014 3701811 That's what you got from that?
3701894 3703886 How are we gonna get into this place?
3705735 3707771 Go! Go! Go! Go!
3714215 3715694 Okay.
3717256 3720168 Looks like they got a party going on.<br />This could be good.
3732377 3734845 Where is everybody?
3750538 3751766 No way!
3760299 3762415 It's some kind of rich guy's fight club.
3762499 3765332 I knew it. They are real.
3769379 3770448 Come on!
3781860 3785250 That's my Boomer! That's my Boomer!
3786061 3787972 Man, this is some<br />Django Unchained bullshit.
3788061 3789061 Water!
3789981 3793337 That's my boy! Good boy! Good boy!
3793541 3795691 Rich people are fucked up!
3795861 3798011 Kramer, get Logan ready!
3798181 3801015 Okay, minimum buy in is now 10 grand.
3801222 3802575 Okay, I think we should split up.
3802742 3803982 Yeah. And let's start upstairs.
3804022 3805982 Anybody finds the egg,<br />just text the others, okay?
3806022 3807878 And for God's sake, be careful with it.<br />All right?
3807902 3808902 Got you. I got it.
3809022 3810137 Be safe.
3812302 3813663 What are you...<br />What are you doing?
3813743 3815017 Who says the egg isn't in here?
3816023 3818821 Also, I have a really good feeling<br />about Logan.
3818983 3822214 Egg, egg, egg.<br />Wow! This is some bedroom.
3822383 3824039 Does it remind you<br />of your celebrity boyfriend's?
3824063 3825212 Are you still on this?
3825343 3827904 Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.<br />That's all I can think about.
3827984 3829053 And that's saying a lot,
3829144 3832261 considering we got Eyes Wide Fight Club<br />going on downstairs.
3832464 3834216 Why is this so important to you?
3834424 3837973 Because, Michelle, look,<br />I am losing my mind here. Okay?
3838144 3839543 We were broken up at the time.
3839704 3843015 I got a hand job from Karen Waller,<br />so you had every right to.
3843225 3844499 So why not just tell me?
3846585 3848621 Okay, fine.
3850385 3851864 It was 10 years ago.
3852065 3855775 I was at a gas station,<br />and I noticed a guy at the next pump.
3857626 3861096 It was Denzel Washington.
3861346 3862574 Hold up.
3864106 3866176 It actually was Denzel?
3866266 3867335 Yeah.
3871587 3873259 He was really nice.
3873347 3877135 He made some joke about how premium gas<br />is probably the same as regular.
3877227 3879821 I took a chance, and I asked him<br />if he wanted to get drinks.
3879907 3881135 He said yes.
3881787 3883301 We both got a little tipsy.
3883388 3885140 I offered to pay for drinks,<br />and he let me,
3885268 3886747 which I thought was pretty cool.
3888268 3890577 We danced for hours.
3893308 3894948 Eventually, we ended up<br />back at his place,
3895028 3897941 and one thing led to another.
3899909 3902821 It was just<br />this crazy thing that happened,
3902909 3904581 and, in a weird way, it made me realize
3904669 3908105 the only person<br />I ever wanna be with is you.
3909949 3910950 Nah.
3911430 3912909 Nah. I don't believe it.
3913190 3914828 - Oh, you...<br />- Mmm-mmm.
3914910 3916787 Well, I took a picture with him<br />at the club.
3916950 3918702 I put it in a hidden folder.
3919790 3920905 Denzel and Michelle.
3926711 3928190 Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.
3928471 3929699 Yeah, it is.
3929871 3931020 Mmm. No, it's not.
3931151 3933506 Dude looks a lot like Denzel,
3934271 3935340 but, uh, it's not him.
3935511 3937706 You're crazy. That's...<br />Look at that, that's Denzel.
3937872 3939912 Okay, let me ask you this.<br />Did he say he was Denzel?
3939992 3941391 Well, no.
3942312 3944951 He tried to introduce himself,<br />and I cut him off
3945032 3947341 because I told him I knew who he was.
3949912 3951983 - What kind of car did he drive?<br />- A BMW.
3952073 3953301 - Hmm.<br />- Three series.
3953393 3956112 Mmm. What was his place like?
3956913 3959268 It... It was a two-bedroom condo.
3961233 3965671 And he used the, um, spare room<br />as an office, so...
3966194 3967794 Do you hear<br />what you're saying right now?
3967954 3969512 Hold on, let me see.
3970514 3972709 When you zoom in,<br />the nose gives it away, right?
3973954 3975273 - God damn!<br />- Mmm-hmm.
3975354 3978346 Look, don't beat yourself up about it,<br />okay? There is some good news.
3978514 3981234 If you wanna get with Denzel, huh,
3981315 3983351 he's standing right here!
3983435 3988225 Because the real Denzel<br />ain't got shit on me.
3990955 3996076 I mean, how does this monster have<br />five kids? We don't get to have one.
3996796 3998991 Well, his wife looks like<br />she's about 15.
3999116 4002426 Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.
4002596 4004791 Right, right. No, I know, honey.<br />We're just gonna...
4004956 4008552 We're gonna keep plugging away<br />until something sticks, okay?
4008637 4011390 Gee, you really sound like a guy<br />who wants to have a kid.
4011517 4012597 Well, you know, I'm just...
4012677 4015794 I'm a little distracted right now,<br />honey, as you might imagine.
4015877 4019586 Look, if you're not into this,<br />you kind of gotta tell me.
4020197 4021198 Listen.
4021878 4025029 I wanna have a baby,<br />but how do I explain this? Um...
4026358 4028918 Do you remember how we used to play<br />Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes,
4028998 4030094 and we could play all night?
4030118 4032374 Do you remember, this one time,<br />I made it all the way up to level 86,
4032398 4034775 - and you were not too far behind, right?<br />- Eighty-five, but...
4034799 4036279 And then I kicked your ass at Galaga.
4036319 4038199 - So anyway, what is the point?<br />- Mmm... Anyway,
4038239 4040150 do you remember<br />how we stayed alive so long?
4040239 4042150 All we did was we ate the pellets.
4042239 4044958 We never ate the fruit<br />because the fruit is how they get you.
4046799 4048152 Oh, you're doing a metaphor!
4048240 4049719 Yes, but here's the problem.
4049800 4052268 No matter how long you and I<br />stayed alive in the game,
4052360 4054480 neither one of us ever made it<br />up to the leader board.
4055720 4057631 And you think if we have a baby,
4057720 4059119 we'll be officially settling down,
4059200 4061589 and you'll never make it<br />onto the leader board of life?
4061680 4063273 That's such a good metaphor.
4063361 4065636 Yeah, no, it's not.<br />It's kind of bullshit.
4065721 4066721 Why?
4066801 4068598 - What are we, 16 years old?<br />- No.
4068761 4071434 You wanna go backpacking<br />through Europe? Huh?
4071601 4074434 You wanna, like, have some wine coolers<br />on a football field
4074521 4076194 with Rebecca De Mornay?
4076362 4078034 Not specifically.
4078202 4080762 You know<br />who's always gone for the fruit, Max?
4080922 4085120 Your criminal brother, and that is why<br />the ghosts are about to eat him!
4085282 4087000 Look who's embracing the metaphor.
4087082 4088561 I'm so... I'm... Wow.
4089042 4091716 You know what? All this time,<br />I've just been thinking
4091803 4095921 that if I helped you beat Brooks,<br />you would be less stressed.
4096003 4099473 But you don't wanna beat Brooks.<br />You wanna be Brooks.
4101603 4103400 I'm gonna look somewhere else.
4116124 4118480 Come on, Logan! Boomer ain't shit!
4118565 4120044 Hey, ADHD!
4120125 4121685 We're supposed to be looking for the...
4124245 4126884 Holy shit. I'm right again.
4129005 4130597 Wait, where are you going?
4130685 4132662 Everybody's watching the fight.<br />I'm gonna go grab it.
4132686 4135519 - No, don't fucking...<br />- Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.
4147567 4148567 Kill him!
4150567 4152478 Oh, shit!
4156127 4157127 Who the hell are you?
4158167 4159168 Me?
4159248 4162240 Yeah. Who are you?<br />And what are you doing with my egg?
4162928 4165158 Oh. I was just admiring it.
4165248 4169287 I got a bunch of these fancy-pants eggs<br />back at home. In my mansion.
4169808 4172003 - Uh-huh.<br />- This one's ugly. Hmm.
4173529 4174928 Does anybody know this guy?
4175009 4180686 I certainly hope so.<br />I'm the CEO of Cyberdyne Systems.
4180769 4182327 I should go.
4183209 4184403 Boomer, take him down.
4184489 4186446 Everyone hold on a goddamn second!
4191010 4192159 Boomer!
4197050 4198050 Hey, any luck yet?
4198210 4199325 - No.<br />- You?
4199490 4203450 Go! Go! Go! I got it! I got it!<br />Let's go! Come on!
4213571 4214828 Sorry. Sorry.
4214852 4216046 Hey, Ryan! Ryan!
4216492 4217766 Oh, shit.
4218132 4219451 No!
4219532 4220965 Okay, okay.
4221052 4222405 Shit!
4225612 4228923 Michelle, I'm open! Hit me.<br />Hit me. Baby.
4231213 4232612 - Oh-ho-ho!<br />- Security!
4232773 4234092 No, you don't.
4234733 4236246 Holy shit!
4236333 4237561 Kev, up here! Throw it!
4237653 4238653 I got it!
4239333 4241609 Oh! Oh, my God, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes!
4242294 4246048 Oh, no! No! No! Get away! Get away!
4250054 4251646 Okay. Oh!
4251974 4253453 Go to the other side!
4253534 4254887 Oh, my God!
4254974 4256931 Annie! Annie, where are you?
4257015 4259734 - Max! Max!<br />- Over here! Hey!
4266735 4267929 No, no, no!
4270256 4271484 Get off me!
4275416 4276416 No!
4278496 4280487 That was easy.
4282937 4284655 Oh.
4289257 4292329 Man, glass tables<br />are acting weird tonight.
4293177 4294815 Go, go, go!
4295257 4297010 Get in! Get in the van!
4297098 4298690 Get in, get in, get in!
4298778 4300814 Get them! Get them!
4316339 4319729 So, you don't wanna have a baby,<br />so we can do more shit like that?
4320539 4322530 No. No.
4322859 4325090 Is that the fruit<br />you were thinking about?
4325260 4327137 Mmm-mmm.<br />That's not the fruit. No.
4327300 4328813 Hey, thanks for the assist.
4328980 4330459 Yeah.
4330940 4333295 I don't even know why<br />I really did it.
4334020 4335860 Do you think<br />it's 'cause you're falling for me?
4338061 4339061 I...
4339941 4341613 Not... Not sure.
4341941 4344535 Ugh. I was joking.
4344701 4346259 Oh. Okay. Yeah.
4347301 4349257 Aren't you gonna say<br />you were joking, too?
4349421 4350649 Do you want me to?
4350821 4352238 - Oh, my God, you're making this weird.<br />- No, I'm not.
4352262 4353775 - Stop it.<br />- Okay, fine.
4353862 4355958 It's two minutes to 12:00.<br />Where the hell is this bridge?
4355982 4359019 GPS says it's right around here,<br />but I don't see it.
4359102 4360899 Oh, oh. Oh. There it is. 4th Street.
4360982 4362262 Oh, shit!
4368383 4370374 - Oh, my!<br />- That's great.
4370943 4373059 That's great.<br />Now they're gonna kill my brother.
4375103 4376172 Oh, God!
4376743 4378142 Hold on.
4379143 4382341 I'm not an expert,<br />but these gems look plastic to me.
4382424 4384619 "Made in China."<br />Is this thing not even real?
4384704 4386501 Maybe just that sticker<br />was made in China.
4386584 4387920 - Let's let them talk.<br />- Can I see?
4387944 4390744 Hey, why would the Bulgarian<br />ask Brooks to bring him a fake egg?
4390824 4393817 Uh, I don't think he wanted<br />an egg at all.
4393905 4396897 I think he wanted<br />what was inside the egg.
4397865 4399981 "WITSEC." What is that?
4400105 4401140 Um...
4401225 4402897 We could ask them?
4420226 4422104 You tell anyone<br />we were coming here?
4422267 4423586 No.
4423747 4424896 I've got your egg.
4424987 4425987 You do?
4426067 4427546 Yeah, but we broke it.
4427707 4429140 - What?<br />- Well, it was a fake.
4429267 4430883 But we have the list of names<br />that was inside.
4430907 4432306 That's what you wanted, right?
4435708 4437778 Okay. Get on the ground.
4437868 4439724 We've got what you want.<br />Can't you just let us go?
4439748 4442023 I said, "On the ground!"
4442948 4444724 You, too, playboy, get over there.<br />Get on the ground.
4444748 4445863 Yeah.
4445948 4447748 None of that<br />child pose bullshit, either.
4448348 4450909 The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,<br />probably you guys, too.
4451069 4452297 Why did you come here?
4452589 4454365 Because you're my brother,<br />and I can't just let you die,
4454389 4455565 even though you might deserve it.
4455589 4457705 Yeah, it's me. We got them all here.
4457869 4460463 You're unbelievable, you know that?
4460629 4462780 You've always<br />been a better person than me.
4462950 4464542 You gotta shut up. Okay?
4464710 4467622 Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.
4467790 4470463 I'm not the carefree dude<br />that wins at everything he touches.
4470550 4472984 You know how I win?<br />I cheat. I cheat at everything.
4473070 4475186 I even cheated when we were kids<br />playing Battleship.
4476911 4478139 What?
4478231 4481701 Didn't you ever wonder why I made you<br />sit with your back to the TV?
4481791 4484589 It was so I could see your ships<br />in the reflection.
4484671 4488186 I mean, I even took five grand<br />every time we played Monopoly
4488271 4489872 before we even started playing the game.
4489952 4493342 I cheated at the Game of Life.<br />And at the game of life.
4493512 4494831 You son of a bitch.
4494912 4497107 - You son of a bitch!<br />- Sit down.
4498192 4500208 - What about you, Princess?<br />- I don't have anything.
4500232 4503669 But it didn't stop there<br />because, when we grew up, Max,
4503753 4506028 you went off to college, and I...
4507113 4509149 You got a career.
4509353 4511947 You married the greatest girl<br />in the world.
4512113 4513944 I knew I couldn't keep up<br />with that success.
4514113 4515990 So I...
4516193 4518310 I told everyone that I got a job<br />on Wall Street.
4518474 4519873 And I did.
4520074 4522827 Selling coke to traders.
4524194 4525343 You didn't invest in Panera?
4525514 4526913 I ate at Panera.
4527074 4528632 Jesus Christ.
4528714 4530511 What's going on?
4530594 4532451 But that's why I've been trying<br />to make it up to you.
4532475 4533851 That's what this whole game night<br />was about.
4533875 4536867 See, I had it rigged<br />so that you'd finally win.
4537915 4540827 The last clue was gonna lead you...
4540915 4542234 Your jacket pocket.
4551996 4553429 Huh.
4555836 4557588 Surprise!
4560797 4563755 I even managed to fuck that up, though.<br />I'm so sorry.
4563837 4565828 I'm so sorry, Max.
4567717 4569867 I think we're gonna be okay, though.<br />I got a feeling.
4569957 4571151 You want us to kill them all?
4572237 4573273 What?
4573358 4575014 - Okay.<br />- Wait, wait. Just let us go.
4575038 4576214 We won't tell anyone anything.
4576238 4577998 We got you the list!
4578198 4580632 - What the fuck, man?<br />- Fuck! God damn it!
4582638 4583934 - Oh, shit. The fuzz.<br />- Fuck, man!
4583958 4585277 Freeze!
4585518 4586554 Gary?
4586639 4587735 Don't even think about it, pig.
4587759 4589319 Can't say I care for that nomenclature.
4592599 4593714 Get down!
4594559 4596311 Come on, bitch!
4597879 4598879 Motherfucker!
4603640 4605039 God damn it!
4613160 4614594 Hey, isn't that your neighbor?
4615081 4616337 When did Gary get so cool?
4616361 4617396 Oh, my God!
4617481 4618596 Everybody okay?
4618721 4620377 - You're a cool-ass cat, Gary.<br />- You all right?
4620401 4621993 Fine, thank you,
4622801 4626510 though, in sliding, my belt buckle<br />may have inadvertently scratched
4626601 4628160 the finish of my squad car.
4628242 4629834 How did you know we were in trouble?
4629922 4632072 The nocturnal Jenga game,
4632962 4635157 my blood-spattered marital souvenirs,
4635282 4638911 and Max's curious search history<br />piqued my interest.
4639002 4641357 - Right. Oh, God.<br />- You, uh...
4641442 4643161 You saved our lives.
4643243 4644392 Thank you.
4645043 4646283 Just doing my job.
4648083 4649232 - Oh, my God!<br />- Oh!
4649323 4651393 - Shit!<br />- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
4652603 4653638 Gary!
4655083 4656780 Hello? I need an ambulance.<br />Officer down.
4656804 4658300 - Oh, shit!<br />- Hang in there, pal.
4658324 4659677 Hang on. Hang on, pal.
4659764 4660940 Hang on. You're gonna be all right.
4660964 4662140 We're gonna get you to a hospital.
4662164 4663802 Okay, look at me. Gary, look.
4663884 4665840 You have got a lot to live for, okay?
4665924 4666924 Do I?
4667004 4668483 - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br />- Yeah.
4668564 4670442 I have no wife.
4671885 4673557 - No friends.<br />- That's not true.
4673725 4674840 No, don't say that.
4675005 4676861 - You got us. We're your friends.<br />- You've got us.
4676885 4681356 You don't even like<br />spending time with me.
4681445 4682764 Yes, we do. We just...
4682845 4684518 We've been a little selfish. That's all.
4684606 4686342 - Right, right.<br />- You know, I'm sorry about that.
4686366 4687366 Oh, God. Oh, God.
4687446 4689243 - Bastian.<br />- Huh?
4690606 4693200 Someone please take care of Bastian.
4693286 4696437 Gary, you are gonna take care of Bastian<br />yourself, okay?
4696526 4697703 Listen, soon as you get out<br />of the hospital,
4697727 4699807 you're gonna come to every single<br />game night we have.
4700927 4702246 Don't...
4702607 4703676 Yeah?
4703767 4706679 Don't you ever
4708527 4710518 exclude me again.
4710608 4713486 - Never exclude you again, pal.<br />- No.
4715248 4717557 - Oh, God. What is that?<br />- What's that?
4717648 4719604 Is that a blood clot?
4720168 4722477 It's a blood capsule.
4722568 4724240 - Huh?<br />- A blood capsule?
4725129 4728838 And that is how<br />you do a game night.
4732489 4733558 What?
4735689 4737327 I've duped you all.
4737409 4738410 Wha...
4739330 4742606 Hold on a second. Are you telling me<br />that this whole thing was a game?
4745170 4746398 - What? What?<br />- Damn!
4746490 4747490 Shit!
4747610 4749328 I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.
4749410 4751706 When I learned you stopped inviting me<br />to your game nights,
4751730 4754529 I hijacked<br />Brooks's murder mystery party,
4754611 4756442 and I staged a kidnapping of my own.
4756531 4758010 You gotta be kidding me.
4758091 4761288 What better way to prove my worth<br />as a game night participant?
4761371 4763407 Well, what about these dudes?<br />Are they actors?
4763491 4765447 Oh, no. They're... They're felons.
4765531 4766532 Felons?
4766612 4768268 I was able to shave some time off<br />of their parole
4768292 4770487 in exchange<br />for this little side project.
4770732 4771847 We square now?
4771932 4773251 Thank you, gentlemen.
4773332 4774606 That lady hit me with the car.
4774692 4776308 Hey, what the hell kind of psycho<br />are you?
4776332 4778926 You put us through all this,<br />just for your own amusement?
4779012 4782369 No, no. Just the opposite.<br />For your amusement.
4782453 4783602 Did everyone have fun?
4783733 4785371 - No! No.<br />- Yeah. No.
4785453 4787091 No fun! I got shot!
4787173 4788242 By me!
4788333 4790893 I don't see how that's possible.<br />My men were using blanks.
4790973 4792929 Well, that was my gun.<br />It was a real gun.
4793013 4795687 So, this whole thing, the Fabergé egg,
4795774 4797287 the Bulgarian, that was you?
4798974 4800043 You've lost me.
4800134 4802284 The egg, the WITSEC list?
4802374 4804410 It's all you. All part of your game?
4808015 4810591 This is a list of people in<br />the Federal Witness Protection program.
4810615 4811730 How did you get this?
4811815 4814204 From inside the egg.<br />Stop fucking with us. It's over!
4814295 4817014 I'm not fudging with you.<br />I honestly have no idea what...
4819015 4821371 Oh, boy. Yikes!
4822256 4824032 - I mean, how stupid do you think we are?<br />- Hey, Max.
4824056 4826092 Gang, are we looking<br />at the big twist here?
4826176 4827689 He gets shot again!
4827776 4830432 And by who? A couple of new characters<br />you introduce at the last minute.
4830456 4831969 Dude, you've jumped the shark!
4832056 4833648 Do you go to the magic shop
4833736 4835977 - to buy a bunch of these little bullets?<br />- No.
4838057 4839410 Hang on.
4839497 4842455 This is Officer Kingsbury.<br />We got a 10-00 on the 4th Street.
4845457 4847687 Which one of you is Brooks Davis?
4850498 4853137 It's funny.<br />You don't look like an asshole.
4853898 4855934 Do I look like an asshole to you?
4856498 4857567 No.
4857658 4859933 One of us has to be the asshole<br />in this transaction
4860018 4862613 because otherwise I'd have my egg,<br />and you'd have your money.
4862699 4866055 But instead, we've wasted our night<br />tracking you down.
4867819 4869537 Now, we're gonna have to kill you.
4869619 4871257 - What? No, no, no, no.<br />- What?
4871619 4873052 Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?
4873219 4876097 Hi, I'm Max.<br />I'm Brooks's brother.
4876180 4878250 And, you know, look. He screwed up.
4878340 4879596 - Right? You got greedy.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4879620 4880655 He admits it.
4880740 4882617 Good news is, though,<br />that we got your egg.
4883100 4885455 It is broken. Uh, my screw up.
4885540 4888008 But, um, I got the list.
4888100 4889900 which I bet you've been after<br />this whole time.
4889981 4890981 What about this?
4891061 4892972 How about
4893621 4897614 you take this list for free,<br />and we all go our separate ways?
4897701 4899657 Nobody gets hurt.
4899741 4902699 Uh, except the poor folks on this list,<br />I'm guessing.
4904902 4906017 Okay.
4906702 4907702 Okay?
4907822 4910382 Deal. Makes perfect sense.
4910462 4912462 No, no. You give him that list,<br />he's gonna kill me.
4912502 4913821 That's nonsense.
4916742 4918574 What the hell is wrong with you?
4919063 4921019 I'm just trying to buy myself some time.
4921103 4924175 Not much. We're just gonna<br />cut it out of you on the jet. Take him.
4927743 4929415 Don't follow us, Max. I'm serious!
4929503 4931620 I'm not worried about that.
4935264 4936743 You just letting them go?
4936824 4938894 Yeah, they've done nothing wrong.
4939024 4941015 Only this one.
4941344 4942777 - Let's go.<br />- Don't follow us!
4942864 4944900 Gary! He's breathing.
4946065 4948321 You know, the only private air terminal<br />around here is at Conway.
4948345 4949903 Yeah. How are we gonna get there?
4950425 4951881 Brooks's house is<br />not that far from here.
4951905 4953020 But our car's not there.
4954225 4955374 Yeah, it is.
4965266 4967985 You know, you don't have to do this<br />because I can just poop it out.
4968826 4972136 We're not gonna go digging<br />through your feces. That's disgusting!
4972266 4974303 Now, hold still<br />while I cut your stomach open.
4974387 4975706 No, no! No! Whoa!
4976987 4978261 What the hell?
4980547 4982344 - Is that...<br />- That's my brother.
4982427 4983985 Get us in the air.
4984067 4985067 Now!
4996188 4997223 - Hold on!<br />- Oh!
5000869 5002143 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, you?
5002229 5003344 - Yup, good.<br />- Okay.
5008029 5009621 Okay, okay. What's our plan?
5009709 5011108 I have one idea.
5011189 5013464 It's so crazy, though, baby,<br />it just might work.
5013549 5014726 You're gonna<br />crash the car into the plane,
5014750 5016581 like Liam Neeson in Taken 3?
5016950 5018542 He did that in Taken 3, huh?
5023110 5025030 - All right, are you ready? Here we go!<br />- Uh-huh.
5026590 5028183 Oh, my God!
5031551 5033303 Uh, you missed it.
5033391 5034540 Thanks, baby.
5039631 5040700 Brooks, we're coming!
5040791 5041861 Whoo!
5060113 5063583 Well, at least I got<br />to drive it for 10 minutes.
5065833 5066948 Oh, my God.
5067113 5068228 - We have to hide.<br />- Yeah.
5068393 5069509 Okay. Go.
5069594 5072745 Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!
5072994 5074552 Go, go, go! It's stuck.
5075914 5076983 Fuck!
5077914 5079313 God damn it!
5097276 5098550 Where you at, lady?
5098636 5100627 Come on, you little bitch.
5101596 5103427 I know you're back here somewhere.
5104956 5107754 Let's end this shit.<br />I won't kill you. Come out!
5108796 5110673 Come on, get your ass out here!
5110837 5112065 Turn on the belt!
5112157 5113157 What?
5113237 5114613 - I'm not gonna hurt you.<br />- Look at the box!
5114637 5117026 - Let's talk!<br />- Can you charade it to me?
5117117 5118948 Charades?
5119557 5121752 That's some cute full-circle bullshit.
5121837 5123475 Here we go. Three words.
5123597 5124713 Come on, lady.
5124798 5125833 Where are you?
5128278 5129313 Turn.
5129398 5130592 Turn, turn, turn. Turn.
5131078 5132113 On.
5132198 5135031 Turn on. Turn on what? Turn on what?
5136558 5138629 Turn on belt?
5138799 5141359 Turn on belt!
5150319 5152550 Boy, that's a slow belt.
5163520 5165033 Hey!
5165400 5167710 Oh, God! Annie!
5170401 5171959 Oh, boy, that was...
5172041 5173257 You saw what I was going for,<br />though, right?
5173281 5174281 Yeah, yeah.
5174401 5176697 But then did you see when I hit him<br />with the fire extinguisher?
5176721 5178977 - I sure did. I sure did, yeah.<br />- That was cool, right? Yeah.
5179001 5180071 - Yeah.<br />- Great.
5180162 5181162 Do you want this?
5181282 5183477 Well, I don't want you to have it,<br />Calamity Jane.
5183562 5184756 All right, look.
5184842 5187117 I think I saw a hatch<br />at the top of the plane.
5187202 5188521 Maybe I can get the drop on him.
5188602 5190035 - "The drop"?<br />- Yup, yeah.
5190122 5191122 Who are you?
5191202 5192298 Why don't you go use<br />the emergency phone? Call for help.
5192322 5193322 I'm gonna do the drop.
5193402 5195359 Okay. You're not Liam Neeson!
5195443 5197354 - That hurts my feelings!<br />- I'm sorry!
5207524 5209196 That's enough of this shit.
5229245 5230245 Max!
5231725 5233141 I can't get the drop on anyone tonight.
5233165 5234359 Put that little knife down!
5234445 5236038 Right now! That's it.
5236486 5238078 Ahh!
5238486 5240446 Right in my bullet hole.
5245366 5247118 Come on, come on, come on.
5250927 5251927 Shit!
5256527 5257527 Stop!
5258847 5260166 Drop it!
5262007 5263043 Wait, wait. Um...
5263408 5266957 You don't have to do this.<br />I have kids at home.
5267568 5269047 Not with that ass you don't.
5269448 5270563 Oh.
5270648 5272286 Well, thank you.
5272608 5273677 You're welcome.
5276649 5278765 Shit!
5280609 5282042 Yes!
5282849 5284840 Oh, no, he died!
5315451 5317966 And that's how<br />you get the drop on someone!
5318052 5319121 Oh, my God!
5319972 5321371 Oh. Oh!
5321452 5323329 - I got you! I got you!<br />- This is high.
5325092 5326127 You're amazing.
5326212 5327772 - You can cut me loose now.<br />- Thank you!
5327892 5329086 Okay. Okay, okay.
5329252 5331004 - Uh...<br />- Yeah. In the bag.
5331172 5332973 - This? Okay.<br />- Look in the bag. That's right.
5333213 5334441 Okay.
5334853 5335888 Oh! Thank you!
5335973 5337929 - Okay. You all right?<br />- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
5340813 5341882 Whoa.
5341973 5343247 Well, look at that.
5343453 5345091 You put a bungee cord in your hand,
5345173 5347130 you go straight to the pervy place,<br />don't you?
5347254 5348254 Hey.
5348334 5350052 You saved my life. Thank you.
5350534 5351933 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
5352014 5354528 I mean, I just saw a man die,<br />but I'm... I'm okay.
5355934 5357811 Is that a knife in your bullet hole?
5357894 5359533 Uh-huh. Hey. I wanna have a baby.
5360095 5361210 Uh, what?
5361295 5362591 I used to think that<br />I wanted Brooks' life,
5362615 5364287 but, you know, turns out he was just...
5364375 5365933 You're a loser. He's a loser.
5366015 5367050 Uh, guilty.
5367135 5368648 But us making a family?
5368855 5371892 That's... That's not pellets.<br />That's the fruit.
5372055 5373774 That's fruit. It's fruit.
5373856 5375175 Wait. What's going on?
5375456 5377731 Plus, think about all the dumdums<br />that have kids, right?
5377816 5380472 And think about how much better<br />our kid is gonna be than their kids.
5380496 5382327 It's gonna beat their kids<br />at everything.
5382456 5383969 It's taken you this long to see that?
5384056 5385967 Our baby is gonna crush<br />every other baby.
5386056 5388033 That's right. That's right.<br />And not in that "peak too early,"
5388057 5389353 you know, "kid actor" kind of way,<br />you know?
5389377 5390377 Mmm-mmm. No.
5390457 5392413 We will parcel out<br />his or her gifts over time.
5392497 5393566 - Absolutely.<br />- Yes.
5393657 5394993 We gotta teach it Mandarin right away.
5395017 5396057 'Cause China's the future.
5396137 5397365 - It sure is.<br />- Yeah.
5397457 5399175 - You're the future.<br />- Oh, my God.
5402578 5404091 Hmm?
5405058 5407492 And that concludes my game night.
5408298 5409572 What?
5409658 5410754 It went exactly as I planned.
5410778 5413850 You learned every lesson<br />that I wanted you to.
5413938 5415770 Trevor, you can get up now.
5420979 5423699 I'm just fucking with you, but that<br />would've been really cool, right?
5423739 5425179 You're such a dick.
5434940 5436976 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Hey!
5438220 5439653 - Hey, hey!<br />- Hey!
5439820 5442654 Come on, come on. Hey, thanks<br />for letting me host again, huh?
5442821 5444618 Well, it's not like we had a choice.
5444781 5446533 Only 36 months to go.
5446701 5447957 Oh, time will fly.
5447981 5449237 - Can I get you a beer?<br />- Uh, yeah.
5449261 5450819 - Come on!<br />- Hey, listen, Brooks.
5451221 5453940 I know you're probably feeling<br />pretty humbled by all of this.
5454021 5457298 But, honestly, I think you're gonna come<br />out the other side a much better man.
5457702 5458851 Oh! Hey, look.
5458942 5460341 I completely agree.
5460422 5462094 You remember the WITSEC list<br />I swallowed?
5462182 5463376 - Sure.<br />- I pooped it out,
5463502 5466175 sold it for $3 million<br />on the black market.
5467062 5468893 - Are you serious?<br />- Pretty sweet, huh?
5469623 5471623 Brooks, everybody on that list<br />is gonna get killed.
5471783 5473102 Oh, no, Max, I'm not a monster.
5473303 5475498 I tipped everyone off<br />that they were in danger.
5475663 5477619 For $20,000 apiece.
5478743 5480079 You're unbelievable.
5480103 5482537 Thank you. It's not like<br />I'm gonna live in this dump forever.
5482623 5485320 As soon as this cuff comes off,<br />I'm gonna buy that house I was renting.
5485344 5486663 I'm moving in with Johanna.
5487264 5488333 There she is.
5488424 5489459 Hey, Dr. Chin!
5489544 5491023 Hey, Max.
5491104 5492457 - Let's play.<br />- Yeah.
5493264 5494413 Uh, The Crying Game?
5494824 5495859 Uh, Boys Don't Cry?
5495944 5497856 Is that a tear? No, is that the actor?
5498025 5499361 - Mr. Potato Head.<br />- Are you drawing the actor?
5499385 5500454 - Cry-Baby?<br />- Yes!
5500585 5501654 Time!
5501745 5503622 - It was The Green Mile.<br />- What?
5503705 5505263 How is that The Green Mile?
5505865 5508299 This is me at the Regal Cinema crying
5508425 5510894 as I did through much of the film.
5511986 5513586 How were we supposed to know that, Gary?
5513626 5516823 I assume everyone cried<br />during The Green Mile.
5517786 5518786 So, who's next?
5518866 5519866 I'll go.
5519946 5521265 - Yeah!<br />- Go, baby!
5521346 5522482 - Yeah!<br />- Nice try, Gary.
5522506 5524019 And go!
5524586 5525622 Uh...
5525707 5527363 - It's a rock.<br />- A bean? A rock!
5527387 5528661 - A ball?<br />- That's a...
5528747 5530163 - Burger. Is that a burger?<br />- Football! Football!
5530187 5531763 No, oh,<br />that's a dinner roll, right?
5531787 5532981 - A bun!<br />- Bread?
5533067 5534864 Is it a bun? Looks like a bun.
5534947 5535947 French loaf?
5536027 5538203 - Is this a motion picture?<br />- Bun is in a house. On a train.
5538227 5539444 Aren't you supposed<br />to announce it?
5539468 5541324 - Microwave?<br />- It's being cooked. It's in an oven.
5541348 5542884 - Bun in the oven!<br />- Yes, yes, yes!
5542908 5545786 Wait. What?
5546188 5547621 Yes.
5548748 5549817 You pregnant?
5549908 5551387 We did it.
5559509 5561784 Oh, my gosh!<br />They're having a baby!
5561869 5563507 They're having a baby!
5973139 5974413 How you doing?
5974499 5976410 - Hi.<br />- I'm Kenny.
5976499 5978091 Nice to meet you, Kenny.
5979339 5982252 Usually people cut me off<br />and say they know who I am.
5982340 5985457 - Oh, yeah?<br />- Yeah. I didn't catch your name.
5986300 5987813 I'm Debbie.
