54889 57182 I need four shots of vodka,<br />four shots of water.

215883 217759 - That's too bad.<br />- What would cause that?
217927 220762 It can be genetic,<br />environmental factors.
220930 223223 Nine times out of 10, though,<br />it's psychological.
223391 225934 Have you been feeling<br />anxious or stressed?
226102 228228 No, I don't think so. Not really.
228396 229896 Uh... He's always a little stressed.
230815 231898 You don't have to write... I'm not...
232066 233149 Honey, she's writing it down.
233359 236611 Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.
236737 237737 We sure are.
237822 239280 One of the reasons<br />I fell in love with him.
239448 243284 Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more<br />prone to stress than normal people.
243452 245370 "Normal people"?
245454 246621 How long has this been going on, Max?
246789 247997 It's not going on.
248499 250959 Oh, well, you did say,<br />even when you were a kid,
251043 253128 you would freak out<br />if you lost at anything.
253546 255672 - Oh, I was a kid.<br />- Especially if you lost to your brother.
255840 256965 Hmm.
257591 259384 Hey, is that what this is?
259468 260468 No.
260553 264264 You have been so uptight since you<br />found out that Brooks is coming to town.
264348 265890 - I don't think that's true.<br />- Could that be a factor in all this?
265975 266975 Let's be fair.
267059 269352 Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.
269437 271521 Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.
271689 273273 - The what?<br />- The brothers.
273441 275984 I'm not sure why we're discussing this.<br />She's not a therapist.
276152 278153 You're not a therapist, right?<br />With all respect.
278320 279821 - No, but I am a doctor.<br />- Sure.
279905 281865 And I believe in<br />treating the whole patient.
281949 285034 So, what is it about your brother<br />that makes you feel emasculated?
285202 286619 Are we gonna do this?
286787 288455 We're right next to the room<br />where I masturbated.
288622 292041 I think he has it in his head<br />that Brooks is cooler
292126 295211 and more successful<br />and hotter than he is.
295296 296546 I never said hotter.
296714 298214 He's charming.
298382 300675 That's interesting. And is he single?
300843 301843 MAX: What's that?
301927 305180 I don't know if I mentioned it, but<br />Keith and I are on a trial separation.
305264 306598 - Oh.<br />- Keith?
307141 308183 Uh, Keith.
308267 310226 So, do you think your brother would<br />wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?
310561 311644 Gosh, I don't know.
311812 313188 Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.
313355 314814 Hurts a little. (SCOFFS)
314982 317400 Now, is he a tall fellow?<br />'Cause I'm only 5'2".
317568 318902 We're all done with my semen?
319069 320528 He is taller than Max.
320696 322906 <i>- Good.<br />- But he did date this ballerina once,</i>
322990 324782 and she was<br />just a teeny-tiny little thing.

345346 347722 Honey, Gary.<br />Don't mention game night, okay?
347806 348848 Mmm-hmm.
348933 350725 - Good evening, Max.<br />- Hey, Gary.
350893 352060 - Annie.<br />- Hello there.
352228 353853 Hi, Gary!
354313 355855 Just checking the mail.
355940 356940 Oh, yeah?
357024 358483 <i>Some people check it earlier in the day,</i>
358651 362487 but there's always a risk<br />that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.
363489 367825 This spares me the chance<br />of a futile trip to the mailbox.
369495 370620 Uh-huh.
370704 375041 Plus, it allows Bastian here<br />the opportunity to urinate.
376126 377835 You have a good one.
378003 379212 Any plans for this evening?
379380 380630 MAX: No.
381298 382674 Perhaps a game night?
382841 384259 We're just gonna stay in,
384343 385635 - just the two of us.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
385719 387303 - Boring.<br />- Mmm.
387471 388805 I see.
390015 394852 I do hope you keep me in mind<br />for any future game nights.
395020 396020 You bet.
396105 399857 I've always enjoyed<br />the camaraderie of good friends
400025 402944 competing in games of chance and skill.
403529 406281 (STAMMERING) Yeah.<br />Yeah, well, we'll do that,
406448 410076 but tonight, it's just the two of us.
410661 413746 Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.
419628 421963 There was a special on these tonight.
422423 423590 Three for one.
423757 425174 Three for one?
425801 426843 Yup.
426927 429137 How can that be profitable<br />for Frito Lay?

433601 435435 - I don't know what they're doing.<br />- (CHUCKLES)
435853 438396 Well, you two enjoy each other.
439189 443693 It's often we don't appreciate<br />what we have until it's gone.
448073 449699 MAX: I think that's it.<br />ANNIE: Okay.
449867 450992 Bye-bye!
457291 459500 If Gary sees the others coming,<br />we're screwed.
459668 460793 No, no, honey,<br />it's not gonna be a problem.
460961 463087 I was very, very clear with everyone<br />to park far away
463255 465131 and just to sneak in quietly, you know.
465299 467800 But now, I mean, you don't think<br />we're being dicks, do you?
467968 469344 I mean,<br />should we just still invite the guy?
469428 470511 He really seemed like he wanted to play.
470679 472513 No, no. Debbie was our friend,
472681 474807 and Gary was just the creepy husband<br />that we had to put up with.
474892 475892 That's true.
475976 477352 He's only gotten worse<br />since the divorce.
477519 480271 Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?<br />Fuck him!

519395 522689 You said sneak in<br />so RoboCop wouldn't see us.
522856 524148 I meant sneak in through the door.
524316 525525 Well, you were super vague.
525693 526859 - I wasn't vague at all.<br />- Wine?

563647 564856 There's one just down the hall.<br />You need it?
565023 568192 Okay, is it on the right or the left?<br />I don't wanna go in the wrong room.
568360 569527 The one with the toilet.

579872 581497 Aren't you sick of<br />losing game night every week
581582 582623 because of the dates you bring?

603645 604854 Okay, unlike you psychos,
605022 606814 I don't give a shit<br />about winning game night.
606982 608483 I don't need that validation.
608650 610860 But you do need the validation<br />of dating Instagram models?
611028 612069 Absolutely.
612237 614572 I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br />I'm not like you, Michelle.

619453 621162 And we didn't get married<br />until we were 19.

623081 625291 I hope one day you<br />get to meet a lovely, young lady.

638639 639972 What's that?
640140 641349 - (WHISPERS) Fight clubs.<br />- What?
641517 642683 I just read about them.
642851 644936 They pay poor people<br />to fight each other,
645020 646020 and then they bet on the winner.
646230 647897 - No, that's not a real thing.<br />- Yes, it is!

663038 664121 I don't think we need to. No, he's late.
664289 666541 - Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?<br />- MAX: Yeah.
666708 667792 I thought he was working in Europe.

685102 686811 He's like the Mark Wahlberg<br />to Max's Donnie.
686895 687937 Well...
688021 689105 Which is a huge compliment
689189 691732 because Donnie was fucking great<br />in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?

748916 750124 (SHOUTS) What's that?
752836 754337 Hello, again.
754713 755838 Mmm...
755923 757673 Still wearing the uniform.
759092 760426 Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.
760594 762595 I hope you didn't start<br />game night without me.
762679 764055 (MAX SHUSHING)
764556 765723 Did you not get my text?
765891 767308 What text?
767768 769060 Oh, hello, Officer.
770938 772605 Why's that guy staring at us?
772773 774440 Gary, I want you<br />to meet my brother, Brooks.
774608 778069 We're having a little family<br />three-man game night tonight.
778236 779487 Wait, what do you mean three-man?
779655 781155 You said that Michelle<br />and Ryan and Kevin were...
781323 782782 No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.
782950 784075 I can see them in the doorway.
784242 786118 There's a whole mess of people.<br />Hey, guys!
786286 787703 MAX: There they are.<br />RYAN: Hey!
787871 789163 These guys are leaving.
789247 790247 Take off, guys.
790332 792541 We had a little bit<br />of a mix-up with the, um...
793585 794877 - God damn it!<br />- What?
795045 796754 We didn't want him to know<br />that we're having a game night.
796922 800299 He used to come, and we don't<br />like him anymore, so...
800384 801634 Oh.
802052 803344 You know, I think he knows now.
803512 804679 He sure does.
804846 808265 Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.
808767 811519 (LAUGHS) I haven't seen you in a year!
811687 814647 Hey, you smell good.
814815 817984 What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?<br />Head and Shoulders?
818151 819777 Why do you assume<br />it's a dandruff shampoo?
819945 822196 Well, I mean, you've always<br />been a little bit of a snowstorm.
822364 823656 - Hey, would you hold that for a second?<br />- Yup.
823824 824907 Hey, guys!
825075 827618 Well, you look good, stranger.
827786 828786 It's been forever.
828954 830621 I know, and that's my fault.<br />I'm so sorry.
830956 832206 Sweet ride, Brooks.
832374 834166 Oh, you like that?<br />I just got her a couple weeks ago.
834334 835459 What is that? A Corvette?
835627 838546 It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.
838714 839922 It was my dream car as a kid.
840090 842008 And that's what<br />gave me the idea to get it.
842092 843968 You know what? I love your house.
845012 846137 Are you being sarcastic?
846304 847388 No, I mean I love your house.
847556 849181 It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.
849349 850808 Makes me think of simpler times.
850976 852309 "Simpler"?
852477 854395 Uh, so, how long are you in town for?
854479 855563 You know, I'm not sure.
855731 857106 It depends on how many clients
857190 859191 the firm's gonna be<br />having me schmooze while I'm here.
859276 860317 (BOTH LAUGHING)
860402 861444 <i>But hopefully for a while.</i>
861528 863821 I don't get to see you guys, and I...
865615 868159 God, I really miss you, man.<br />I really do.
868243 869827 - Oh.<br />- (BROOKS SIGHS)
870454 871912 Miss you, too, Brooks.
872289 873372 RYAN: And go!
874166 875833 Shock-rocker. Dated Rose McGowan.
875917 877376 Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.
877544 878627 Yep. You got it.
878712 880629 - Quick story.<br />- There's no pausing.
880797 883340 You remember the urban myth where<br />Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out
883508 884592 so he could go down on himself?
884926 885968 ALL: Yeah.
886053 887303 You don't mind me telling the story,<br />do you, Max?
887471 888471 You're in the middle of a...
888638 890848 You were 14 years old.<br />It's an adorable story.
891016 892016 I forbid it.
892184 894351 I'm a little curious.
894519 896312 Did you blow yourself?
896605 898105 You know the bungee cords on roof racks?
898190 899190 Yeah.
899274 902318 Max took one of those bungee cords,<br />and he put it around his neck.
902486 903486 Here he goes.
903570 904862 And then he wrapped it behind his legs
904946 907239 so he could squish his face<br />down into his crotch,
907407 908908 <i>- (ALL GASP)<br />- but the problem was</i>
909076 911660 that it got stuck!<br />He couldn't unhook it.
912579 914622 - (ALL LAUGHING)<br />- And about an hour later
914790 917083 Mom comes home, and she finds him there.
917250 918292 KEVIN: Shit!
918460 919919 Her little pretzel boy<br />on his bedroom floor naked.
920962 922546 - (LAUGHING CONTINUES)<br />- Little pretzel boy?
922714 924590 Great story. Are we back on now?
924758 926050 So?
926343 927343 "So" what?
927511 928636 Did you suck it?
929012 930262 - (ALL LAUGHING)<br />- Let's go. Come on. Brooks.
930430 931764 Back to it. Come on. Play the game.
932599 934391 Poor man's Johnny Depp,<br />starred in Jericho.
934559 935935 Skeet Ulrich.
936436 938854 UN Secretary General '92 to '96.
939022 940064 Oh, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
940524 943317 <i>This guy. He hated kids<br />in Jurassic Park.</i>
943485 944485 Uh, Sam Neill.
944653 946403 Dubstep DJ, looks like Corey Feldman.
946488 947488 - Skrillex.<br />- BROOKS: Yep.
947572 949657 - Rappers love this Cubist painter.<br />- Picasso!
949825 952118 <i>- Big cat shot by asshole dentist.<br />- KEVIN: Cecil the lion!</i>
952285 953619 - Time!<br />- (GRUNTS)
953703 954787 - How many?<br />- KEVIN: Seven!
954871 955913 Seven!
955997 957206 (CHEERING)
958458 959667 You're up, pretzel boy.
959835 960835 ANNIE: Whoo! Go, Max!
961086 963003 - Come on, Max.<br />- All right. Here we go.
963171 964964 RYAN: And kick it. Go!
966716 967716 Oh, this is easy!
967801 971345 Annie, the famous actor that we met<br />at the airport about eight years ago.
972764 973764 Who?
973932 975766 Only actor we've ever met<br />at an airport who's famous.
976434 977560 Bobby Flay?
977727 980688 Not an actor. This fellow was<br />in front of us at the Sbarro.
980856 983107 We were wondering why he<br />wasn't in the first-class lounge.
983275 984859 Oh, yes, yes.
985360 986360 Who was that?
986528 987570 God damn it!
987654 989029 Max, there's a whole room of people<br />to help you out here.
989197 990281 - Use us.<br />- Good point.
990782 992408 (STAMMERING) He was the Incredible Hulk.
992576 993617 BOTH: Eric Bana.
993785 995703 - Other one.<br />- MICHELLE: Um, Mark Ruffalo.
995871 997204 - Other one.<br />- KEVIN: Lou Ferrigno.
997372 999373 Holy shit! Primal Fear.
999541 1001292 Richard Gere never played<br />the Incredible Hulk.
1001459 1003377 - Time.<br />- Motherfucking Ed Norton!
1003461 1004628 ALL: Oh!
1004713 1005754 <i>Primal Fear!</i>
1005922 1007089 Oh, my God!
1007257 1008257 <i>RYAN: He was the Hulk.</i>
1008341 1009925 <i>KEVIN: The Hulk.<br />RYAN: I forgot that.</i>
1010010 1011802 Max. Zero points.
1011970 1014805 I'd say he blew it,<br />but he won't tell us, will he?
1015015 1016348 (ALL LAUGHING)
1017434 1019185 <i>RYAN: Shit! Did you?</i>
1019352 1021395 I can't believe I didn't get Bob Barker.
1021563 1024648 Hey, guys! What do you say<br />we do this at my house next week?
1025025 1026108 - House? What house?<br />- Ooh. Really?
1026276 1028777 Since I don't know how long<br />I'm gonna be here, I rented a place.
1028945 1030362 It's only a couple miles away.
1030530 1031864 You know, it's up on Broadmoor.
1032032 1033490 Oh! Swanky neighborhood.
1033658 1036202 It's a very cool house,<br />but it's just me there alone.
1036369 1038287 It'd be great<br />to have you guys come over.
1038455 1042082 Oh, well, it's kind of a tradition<br />to have game nights here.
1042250 1043459 But you know what?
1043627 1045544 Let's let him show off<br />his big house, huh?
1045712 1047004 BROOKS: That's the spirit!
1047172 1048422 Trust me.
1049841 1053385 This will be a game night to remember.
1054095 1055262 - Oh, boy.<br />- Mmm.
1055347 1056388 Promise?
1056473 1058390 Good night, everybody.<br />I love you much. Drive safely.
1058558 1059683 - Kisses!<br />- All right.
1059851 1061393 KEVIN: Take it easy.<br />ALL: Bye.
1061561 1064188 That little motherfucker.
1064564 1065689 Whoa!
1065774 1067942 Well, I mean, come on.
1068109 1070110 We don't see him in over a year.
1070278 1072821 He shows up in your dream car,
1072989 1075866 insults our house, and then tells<br />an embarrassing story about you
1076034 1078160 right before your turn<br />just to throw you off your game.
1078328 1081038 Welcome to my whole life. Why are you<br />suddenly so worked up about it?
1081206 1082915 Well, cause now<br />he's messing with your balls
1083083 1085042 and literally killing<br />millions of our babies.
1085210 1086835 Well, that's a little dramatic,
1087003 1088963 but, yeah, you know,<br />I mean, that's Brooks.
1089130 1091173 I thought that this<br />was just regular old brother stuff,
1091341 1092508 - but I totally see it now.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1092676 1094593 He undermines you every chance he gets.
1094678 1095803 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1095887 1097763 - It's crazy!<br />- Thank you, Annie.
1097931 1100057 You know, I've never won<br />a single game against him.
1100225 1101225 I just...
1101309 1103936 I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.
1105188 1106397 - Fix it?<br />- Yeah.
1106564 1107564 What are you suggesting?
1107732 1109817 I'm suggesting we beat his ass.
1109985 1111819 Jesus Christ.
1113196 1114947 Good evening.
1115115 1117032 - We're gonna skip the cleanup?<br />- (CHUCKLES)
1122455 1124164 Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?
1124332 1126041 No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.
1126209 1127376 - I'm gonna stay alert and ready.<br />- GARY: Evening!
1127544 1128711 - Jesus, Gary!<br />- (ANNIE GASPS)
1129754 1130921 Where are you headed?
1131089 1133716 We are going to, uh, to my brother's.
1134092 1136218 Another game night?
1136386 1138721 No. No, absolutely not.
1138888 1140472 We're going to, um,
1141391 1142433 have some dinner.
1142600 1143642 Eat.
1143768 1145185 I see.
1145520 1149231 Pity. I was going to invite you<br />over for a dinner I'm hosting.
1150066 1152901 I've purchased four lamb shanks
1153069 1157906 that I've been simmering<br />in a broth of red wine and rosemary.
1158283 1159950 That sounds so yummy, though.
1160035 1161035 Damn it.
1161119 1163329 It was actually Debbie's recipe.
1164789 1170627 I like to think she left behind her<br />recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,
1172547 1176050 but it was most likely<br />an unintentional oversight.
1181348 1184224 Well, here we go.
1185602 1186894 GARY: What?
1187979 1189146 I'm sorry?
1190231 1192024 I thought you said something.
1192317 1194109 - No.<br />- Nope, not us.
1194569 1195611 Okay.
1198531 1200157 - (CAR ENGINE STARTS)<br />- Have fun.
1203661 1205245 MAX: Oh, fuck me.
1206164 1207956 A guy who rents a house this big
1208124 1211251 must be making up for something<br />pretty small, I'd say.
1211419 1213796 No, no. No, I've seen his dick.<br />It's pretty great.
1213963 1215756 Well, I tried.
1217217 1218467 - Hey!<br />- MAX: Hey!
1218635 1219760 - ANNIE: Hey!<br />- How are you doing, beautiful?
1219928 1222346 - Good, good. Really fancy.<br />- Very nice house, Tony Stark.
1222514 1224390 Should we give<br />our drink orders to Jarvis? (CHUCKLES)
1225058 1227810 No, I got the Tony Stark part,<br />but then you went full nerd on me.
1227977 1229478 I kind of lost you,<br />but please do come in.
1229562 1230562 All right.
1230647 1231730 - Thanks, Cap.<br />- Hi, guys!
1231815 1232815 ALL: What's up?
1232899 1236360 Boy, could sleep four<br />on that couch. Look at that.
1236444 1238153 Oh, hello, friends.
1238321 1241824 Hey, let me introduce you to my date.<br />This is Sarah.
1241991 1243992 Sarah is head of company accounting<br />at our office.
1244160 1245327 Well, corporate communications.
1245495 1248414 And she's also British,<br />which means she's smart as shit.
1248581 1250290 - I'm Irish.<br />- Okay? Same island.
1250458 1251542 Well, it's really not.
1251626 1252709 <i>- Nice to meet you. Hi.<br />- Nice to meet you, too.</i>
1252794 1253919 - I'm Max.<br />- Annie.
1254003 1257005 So, you can't always judge a book<br />by its past covers, can you?
1257173 1259216 - ANNIE: Mmm.<br />- Almost a saying.
1259384 1260467 - Here you go.<br />- Hey, Brooks.
1260635 1262094 - Cheers.<br />- We didn't know if you had any games,
1262178 1264388 so we thought we'd bring you<br />a few of our favorites.
1264556 1266098 Hey, look at that.
1266516 1268100 - (CLATTERS)<br />- ALL: Whoa!
1268184 1269435 MAX: Huh.<br />MICHELLE: The poor games.
1269602 1271520 I told you we're taking it up a notch.
1271688 1274648 The game that we're<br />gonna play tonight is so epic
1274816 1277151 that we don't need a board,<br />and we do not need pieces.
1277318 1278861 Still didn't need to throw them<br />across the room.
1279028 1280279 I was being theatrical.
1280447 1282197 Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?
1282365 1283407 A what?
1283491 1285367 It's when rich people<br />pay poor people to fight each other...
1285535 1287870 Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.<br />Stop with the fight club, okay?
1288037 1289329 - It's nonsense.<br />- No.
1289497 1290873 Ryan believes everything he reads.
1291040 1292541 Thank you.
1292709 1295002 So, what are we playing?
1297505 1302176 In the next hour, someone in this room<br />is going to be taken.
1302343 1305304 And it's gonna be up to you to find them<br />before they are murdered.
1305472 1307431 Oh! It's a murder mystery party.
1307599 1309349 <i>BROOKS: Not just any murder mystery.</i>
1309517 1310976 I found this company.<br />They do it super real.
1311060 1312144 They use legit actors.
1312228 1315314 You're not gonna know<br />what's real and what's fake.
1315482 1317691 <i>- Fun!<br />- But that's not all</i>
1317859 1321987 because whoever finds the victim<br />wins the grand prize.
1323781 1325407 The keys to the Stingray.
1325575 1327159 - What?<br />- Wow.
1327327 1328952 Just the keys?
1329621 1331079 No, Ryan, the whole car.
1331247 1333373 Oh, yes! Oh, man!
1333541 1335042 You're so lucky I brought you<br />to this game night
1335210 1337294 - and not one of Max and Annie's.<br />- Hey!
1337462 1340047 - No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.<br />- Oh.
1340256 1342508 You're not gonna actually<br />give away your car?
1342675 1344134 Oh, it's just a tax write-off.
1344302 1346637 And the Audi, it's more practical.
1347096 1348514 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
1348681 1350766 Okay. How do we start?
1350934 1352684 We just wait for it to begin.
1352852 1355354 Maybe play a drinking game<br />to pass the time?
1355522 1357481 This group does not play drinking games.
1357649 1359691 Tonight we do, Max.
1360610 1361985 - Oh! "Never Have I Ever. "<br />- RYAN: Good one!
1362153 1363445 (QUIETLY) Can you believe this guy?
1363613 1365531 (QUIETLY) Yeah, he's ridiculous.
1365698 1367157 Beautiful house, though.
1367325 1368909 Good champagne.
1372914 1374665 Here we go.
1376084 1378377 Yup. We're at the house.

1400817 1402401 It's for the cheese.
1402569 1405112 Okay, all right. Just, you know,
1405280 1407614 really aggressive way to carry a knife.
1408449 1409449 Oh, no, I've got one.
1409617 1413120 Never have I ever<br />connected my work computer

1420545 1422421 Just for the record,<br />I did not have chlamydia.
1422589 1425424 It was pubic dermatitis. You get it<br />from not washing your crotch, so...

1426801 1428885 I... I like her.
1429262 1431138 And, listen, you're not supposed<br />to single people out in this game.
1431306 1433473 It's supposed to be generic things, like
1433641 1435392 "Never have I ever slept<br />with a celebrity. "
1435560 1437394 Oh, I didn't know. Okay.

1444068 1445861 You slept with a celebrity?
1446029 1448655 No, I was taking a drink<br />separate from the game.

1463838 1464838 What's the deal with that?

1467216 1468216 - Oh. Oh!<br />- Yeah!
1468301 1470177 How could you possibly<br />have had sex with a celebrity
1470345 1472220 when we've only had sex with each other?
1472388 1474514 Please, can you not make this<br />one of your things right now?
1474682 1475807 How is this one of my things?
1476643 1479519 Yeah, Brooks, this is why<br />we don't play drinking games.
1479604 1480604 (POUNDING ON DOOR)
1482649 1484399 It looks like the game is afoot.

1507507 1509049 I'll get right to the point.
1509217 1513970 The Bureau has been tracking a ring<br />of violent kidnappers
1514138 1516223 in this very neighborhood.
1516974 1520310 And we have reason to believe<br />that one of you

1533616 1535575 You'd like for us to do that, yeah?
1536119 1537953 The Bureau's...<br />What's the Bureau's role in this?
1538121 1539871 Maybe you guys could take my wife<br />in for questioning
1540039 1541707 because, apparently, she got a<br />secret life I don't know nothing about.

1544168 1545335 Wow.

1691023 1695026 Mmm. No, there's something about this<br />that just doesn't feel right.
1695570 1697821 How could you cheat on me<br />with a celebrity?
1697989 1699030 I didn't cheat on you.
1699198 1701700 It was before we got married<br />when we took that break.

1722680 1724556 Because it was over the pants,<br />all right?
1724724 1728059 It was, and it hurt. It was very dry,<br />and I didn't climax.
1728227 1729769 Just admit it.<br />You guys did more than that.

1735693 1736693 Come on now!
1736777 1738528 All right. Here's the first clue.<br />Looks like a riddle.
1738613 1740071 "With shiny fangs... "
1740239 1741865 "My bloodless bite... "

1746954 1750749 "Bloodless bite. " It's not a vampire.<br />Um...
1750917 1752250 I'll just Google it.
1752418 1753585 It's so inconsistent, isn't it?
1753669 1755420 I mean, they stage<br />this super realistic fight.
1755588 1758423 They give us an FBI dossier<br />but with riddles.
1758591 1760383 It's like, let's pick a tone.<br />Let's stick with it.
1760551 1762302 But that's the game.<br />You wanna win this car or not?
1762470 1763887 Yeah, yeah. More than anything,
1764055 1765555 but I feel like Brooks is setting me up.
1765723 1767057 Do you get that feeling? You know,
1767224 1770727 that this is some game<br />where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?
1772480 1773939 Mmm-hmm.
1774815 1776942 Well, let's not play by his rules.
1778361 1779861 "My bloodless bite, my bloodless,<br />bloodless bite.
1780029 1781988 "Bloodless bite, bloodless bite,<br />bloodless bite. "
1782156 1784407 Can you stop chanting "bloodless bite"?<br />It's just...
1784951 1786952 - Trying to think.<br />- Yeah.
1787495 1789996 - (CAR ENGINE STARTS)<br />- Oh, shit!
1790539 1792666 <i>Max and Annie must have figured it out.</i>

1800299 1802425 You think we should steal<br />all of his shit!
1803010 1804010 No.
1805054 1806221 (DIALING CELL PHONE)
1808474 1810475 Hi, yeah. I lost my credit card.
1810559 1812352 I was wondering if you could tell me<br />what the last few charges I made were.
1812520 1813603 What are you doing?
1813771 1815355 If we can find out the name<br />of the murder mystery place he used,
1815523 1817607 we can go to their office and<br />pay them off to give us the final clue.
1817775 1819150 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1819318 1823446 You're, like, a double threat.<br />Brains and you're British.
1824448 1825615 Thanks.
1825783 1831204 Okay. What has shiny fangs<br />that bites white things together?
1831372 1832372 A stapler!
1832540 1834499 And the white things are paper.
1834667 1837585 Yes! You are so smart and unfaithful!
1837837 1838878 Oh, there it is.
1839046 1840171 Yes!

1847263 1848263 Okay.
1849140 1850181 KEVIN: Another riddle.
1850349 1853560 "I'm brown and old by day,<br />white and young by night.

1854895 1856771 "I have nine faces but no head.

1869368 1872704 You're the cool one. You know,<br />tracking the phone is just a great idea.

1879378 1882756 You know, baby, I can feel my sperm<br />already coming back to life.
1882923 1884090 - Perfect.<br />- Yeah.
1884258 1887385 So we'll win your brother's car,<br />and then we'll go make a baby in it.
1887553 1889471 - Yeah! We'll make him watch us. Huh?<br />- Yeah.
1890431 1892348 - I don't wanna do that.<br />- No, me neither.
1892516 1893767 - Sorry, don't know why I said that.<br />- I'm not into that.

2074156 2076950 Just tons of fun.<br />And then they had those twins.
2077117 2078493 Boom! Off the grid, right?
2078661 2080745 Last time we saw them<br />was their Christmas card
2080829 2081829 with the wonky kids on it.
2081997 2084791 Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.<br />They look so happy.

2708915 2711750 COLIN: Hold up! Hold up, motherfucker!
2712002 2713043 (SCREAMS)
2713128 2715254 - God damn it!<br />- Man, come on!
2717299 2719300 Brooks, what the fuck<br />is going on with you? Start talking!
2719384 2721844 I've lied to you<br />and the family about what I do.
2721928 2724889 I buy and I sell illegal shit for people<br />in the black market.
2724973 2726223 Really? So you're a criminal?
2726308 2727433 Oh, my God! They're following us!
2729311 2730603 But I made a mistake,<br />because there's this guy.
2730687 2731687 They call him the Bulgarian.
2731771 2734064 He's got his fingers in all these pies<br />around the world.
2734232 2736233 - What kind of pies?<br />- Illegal pies, Max.
2736318 2739069 You know, the kind of pies that have<br />heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.
2739154 2740154 You know, all that kind of stuff.
2740238 2742990 But he just wanted me to help him<br />find this Faberg� egg.
2743074 2745451 Fuck that! Faberg� egg?
2745535 2746994 - Are you kidding me?<br />- No, I'm serious.
2747078 2748078 And I found it!
2748163 2750789 But then there was this other guy,<br />this Marlon Freeman.
2750874 2752958 He's willing to pay twice as much<br />for the same egg.
2753043 2754501 <i>So what? So you screwed over<br />the Bulgarian guy</i>
2754586 2755878 and those fellows behind us<br />work for him,
2755962 2757713 and they just happen to crash your<br />murder mystery party?
2757797 2760090 I know, right?<br />What are the odds of that?
2761551 2762801 - Oh, too close, too close!<br />- Careful, careful!
2765055 2766263 Watch out! Watch out!
2766348 2767348 Oh, oh!
2770060 2771268 - Shit!<br />- Sorry! You okay?
2771436 2772478 Yeah, I'm all right.
2772562 2774980 - We need to go to the cops now!<br />- Yeah, right now! Let's go!
2775148 2776231 - We can't go to the cops!<br />- MAX: Why?
2776399 2777691 The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.
2777859 2778943 On his face?
2780654 2781946 No, in the police department.
2782113 2783447 Look out!
2784824 2786200 <i>- Careful!<br />- (HORNS BLARING)</i>
2790789 2792206 Oh, my God! This is insane!
2806638 2808931 If you call the cops,<br />I'll be dead before I get to jail.
2809099 2810599 Why don't we just get a hold<br />of this Marlon Freeman guy
2810684 2811767 and buy the egg back from him?
2811851 2813936 I couldn't find him if I wanted to.<br />That name's an alias.
2817941 2819566 - Gun, gun, gun! Duck!<br />- Oh, oh...
2829619 2831662 Okay, these guys are not stopping.<br />What do we do?
2831830 2834915 They're not gonna stop<br />until they get me.
2835083 2837001 I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this.
2837085 2838085 ANNIE: Oh, my God!
2838253 2840462 I'm sorry for a lot of things.
2842799 2843882 - Hey! What are you doing?<br />- What is he doing? What is he doing?
2845760 2847761 - I love you, Max!<br />- Brooks, don't be an idiot!
2848638 2849638 (GRUNTING)
2850306 2851306 MAX: Stop the car!
2857981 2859398 (BROOKS GROANING)
2860066 2862526 - Shit! Go, go, go!<br />- Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
2865989 2868157 Fuck! What are we gonna do?<br />They're gonna kill my brother.
2868324 2869908 Oh, Annie, I feel faint.<br />I'm gonna pass out.
2870076 2871869 Oh, honey, we'll get you<br />to a hospital, okay?
2872037 2873328 No, no, no! No hospitals.
2873496 2874747 This is a gunshot wound,<br />they'll call the cops.
2874831 2875831 Shit, shit! Okay.
2875915 2878459 So we go to a mob doctor, right?
2879502 2880836 Do you know one of those, sweetheart?
2881004 2882713 - No.<br />- No.
2882881 2884590 What about a veterinarian<br />that works for the mob?
2885133 2886842 - You know one of those?<br />- No.
2887010 2888427 Come on. Why are you pitching<br />all the mob stuff?
2888595 2890721 - I think 'cause I'm losing my shit here!<br />- I get it.
2890889 2891930 You're gonna have to do it.
2892015 2893015 - What?<br />- Yup.
2893099 2894183 <i>You're gonna have<br />to take the bullet out.</i>
2894350 2895476 I don't wanna... I don't wanna do it.
2895643 2896727 You think I want you<br />to take the bullet out?
2896895 2899146 I've seen you try to cut a chicken.<br />We have no other option.
2899314 2901732 (SOBS) Oh, my God! This is so bad!
2901900 2903442 I hate game night!
2907030 2908363 - Thank you!<br />- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
2909949 2910949 Hey!
2911034 2912701 Oh, thank God.<br />Listen, Annie. It's all real.
2912786 2913786 <i>Oh, no, I know.</i>
2913870 2915496 Brooks is caught up in something and...
2915663 2917039 Okay, where are you guys?
2917123 2918707 We're all at Brooks'.<br />Waiting to talk to the cops.
2918792 2921043 <i>No! No, no, no! Do not talk to the cops!</i>
2921211 2922252 What? Why? What's going on?
2922420 2923670 <i>- Are you guys okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.</i>
2923838 2926006 We're fine. We're fine.<br />I shot Max, but he's fine.
2926091 2927091 What?
2927175 2928509 <i>Look. We will meet you<br />back at our house.</i>
2928593 2930427 Whatever you do,<br />do not tell the cops anything.
2930512 2932805 Brooks's life depends on it.
2937477 2938894 <i>- Hey.<br />- Hi.</i>
2939062 2940187 Okay.
2940355 2941396 I got a bunch of stuff.
2941481 2942481 Yeah.
2943024 2945234 Pocket knife. Tweezers.
2945318 2946777 Sewing kit. Gauze.
2946861 2948320 Good, good. All right.<br />Wow, you did great!
2948488 2950906 Yeah.<br />And they didn't have rubbing alcohol.
2951074 2953867 And they don't sell hard liquor,<br />so I got you this lovely chard.
2954035 2956161 Good idea. Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.
2956329 2958205 What else did you get, huh?<br />More good stuff?
2958748 2960999 What is helpful in Country Living?
2961167 2964920 Oh, that's for later. There's a corn<br />chowder recipe. It looks really good.
2965088 2966922 - You love corn chowder, huh?<br />- Sweet. I do, yeah.
2967090 2968173 - That'll cheer you up.<br />- Thank you.
2968258 2969716 Okay. And then a squeaky toy.
2970260 2971260 - Huh.<br />- For your mouth.
2971427 2972427 - For the pain.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2972595 2974096 Okay. Well, hopefully I won't need this.

2980395 2981395 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
2981563 2982563 - We're gonna push past it.<br />- No problem. No problem.
2982730 2983814 - We're gonna get the bullet out.<br />- Let's just Google.
2983982 2985274 Honey, can you return the text later?
2985441 2987192 This is instructions<br />on how to remove a bullet.
2988111 2989653 - Oh, sorry.<br />- It's an alt-right militia website,
2989821 2991446 so I'm just gonna<br />ignore the racist stuff.
2991614 2992698 - Good. Good, good.<br />- Yeah?
2992866 2994324 Okay. "Step one, sterile gloves. "
2994742 2995993 Check!

3000832 3003458 Um... Okay. "Disinfect wound. "
3003626 3005586 Right, yeah.<br />That's gonna sting, isn't it?
3005670 3007087 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
3007172 3008463 - Let's do it.<br />- Okay?

3023813 3026356 We're just gonna<br />make two tiny incisions...
3026441 3027941 - Oh, my God.<br />- On either side of the wound.
3028026 3030235 Easy-peasy. Huh?
3030528 3031737 This is fun, huh?
3031821 3033697 - Are you having fun?<br />- No.

3038620 3039661 Tiny, teeny.
3039913 3041496 (TOY SQUEAKING)
3043458 3045751 That's not small. That's really big!
3045919 3046960 So big?
3047045 3049171 Way too big, baby.<br />It's a bullet, not a grapefruit.
3049255 3051381 I'm sorry! I'm sorry.<br />This is my first time. I don't know...
3051466 3052966 Oh, there's so much blood.

3060975 3062017 - I'm sorry.<br />- Stop it.
3062101 3063477 I'm looking at you,<br />and you're making me...
3063561 3064937 Well, don't look at me.<br />I won't look at it.
3065021 3066772 - Push through. Let's go.<br />- Okay. All right, okay.
3066856 3067856 - No more cutting.<br />- Oh, shit.
3067941 3069024 Just get the tweezers<br />and get the bullet out, baby.
3069108 3070359 Shit, shit, shit. Um...
3070443 3072569 - What? What happened?<br />- Phone went to sleep.
3072654 3073862 You gotta set it so that thing stays on.
3073947 3075113 - No. My phone doesn't do that.<br />- Sure it does.
3075198 3076531 Same phone as mine. Just change it.
3076616 3078867 Just gonna touch it with my nose<br />every 30 seconds. It's fine.
3078952 3080369 Don't be afraid of your phone.<br />Get in there, go to the settings,
3080453 3083121 go to "Display" and change the timing<br />so that it doesn't revert to sleep mode.
3083206 3084248 - Revert?<br />- Yeah.
3084332 3085916 What are you, Steve Jobs?<br />I'm not reverting anything. No.
3086000 3087042 No, I'm just<br />unafraid of my phone, honey.
3087126 3088126 It's so fucking simple.
3088586 3090337 Shh! Quiet. I know what I'm doing, okay?
3090505 3091713 Do you?
3091798 3092798 Yes.

3098429 3099596 I don't... I don't doubt it.
3099764 3101139 Okay, let's do this.
3101599 3102599 - (EXHALES)<br />- Okay.

3103768 3104977 Ooh... Oh, wait.
3105520 3106520 - (CLICKING SOUND)<br />- What is that?
3106896 3107896 You hear that?
3107981 3109523 What's that sound? What's that sound?
3109607 3110857 Is that the bullet?
3110984 3113277 - (GASPS) That's bone!<br />- What?
3113361 3114903 That's not right.
3115363 3119199 Okay. Um, what do the racists say<br />if you can't find the bullet?
3119284 3120617 Yeah, that's bone. You got the bone.
3120702 3122703 I'm looking at my bone. Look right here.
3122870 3125956 (GASPS) Max, did you get shot twice?
3127083 3128250 (SIGHS)
3129168 3130294 That's the exit wound.
3130795 3132337 Oh, it came out!
3132422 3133922 Yup. Nothing to remove.
3134090 3135299 The bullet has exited the arm.
3135383 3136591 Well, let's just sew<br />that sucker up, huh?
3136676 3137676 Yeah.
3139971 3142597 No, no. Honey, don't, don't look at...
3142682 3143724 - (GAGS)<br />- Stop it.
3143808 3145934 (BOTH GAGGING)
3146102 3147185 ANNIE: I'm sorry.
3147520 3149980 Now, the Bulgarian's guys have Brooks,<br />and the only way to save him
3150148 3152399 is to get that egg<br />from this Marlon Freeman guy.
3152483 3155068 I can't believe your brother's been<br />lying to us this whole time.
3155153 3156862 He's even cooler than we thought.
3156946 3159364 Honey, I think you sewed my arm<br />to my sleeve.
3159449 3161575 I didn't even know<br />Morgan Freeman collected Faberg� eggs.
3161659 3163452 Aren't those worth millions of dollars?
3163536 3165495 It's Marlon Freeman,<br />but that's just an alias.
3165580 3167622 Somehow, we gotta find out<br />his real name, find out his address.
3167707 3169875 - Police computer.<br />- MAX: What do you mean?
3169959 3172044 I once dated this girl<br />whose father was a cop.
3172128 3174087 She showed me her dad's police computer.
3174172 3176965 It has a database with<br />every known alias on it.
3177050 3179676 I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'<br />real name on it.
3179761 3182304 So, if we called her up, would she<br />let you go on her dad's computer?
3182388 3184723 No. No. No way! That ended badly.
3185016 3187809 So how are we gonna get into a police<br />computer without the cops knowing?
3187894 3189186 - Billy Bob Thornton!<br />- MICHELLE: What?
3189270 3191313 - What?<br />- You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?
3191397 3195776 Hang on. Hang on. I know<br />where we can get on a police computer.
3196861 3199112 - Hey!<br />- ALL: Gary!
3199489 3200781 Goodness.
3201491 3203450 To what do<br />Bastian and I owe the pleasure?
3203618 3204993 Well, we were all just talking,
3205161 3207913 and we realized<br />we haven't had a game night in ages,
3208081 3209623 just the seven of us.
3209707 3210707 So...
3210792 3212751 I thought you were going<br />to your brother's house.
3212835 3214002 I never said that.
3214087 3216213 Come on, Gare Bear.<br />Live a little! It's the weekend!
3216297 3219383 We were just saying how you were always<br />better at games than Debbie was.
3219467 3221676 I'll thank you<br />not to besmirch my ex-wife.
3222136 3223595 That woman is an angel.
3223679 3227933 Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games<br />than you.
3228476 3234481 I will admit I have eagerly awaited<br />a visit such as this.
3240571 3241822 Where'd he go?
3242490 3243990 Do we follow him?
3244075 3245283 MAX: It seems like it.
3245368 3246993 - Ryan, you go first.<br />- I'm scared.
3253751 3256253 Help yourself to popped corn<br />with sea salt.
3256337 3258171 Oh! Oh!
3259048 3260507 <i>(GROANS) Yummy, yummy.</i>
3261050 3263635 I can't believe that you read my mind.<br />I was craving popcorn.
3263803 3266138 You have a framed photo of game night?
3266305 3270100 Doesn't everyone have photographs<br />of their best friends in their homes?
3271602 3273979 ANNIE: Ofcourse. We do.
3274564 3276314 Max, uh, you wanna go first?
3276399 3278275 Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.
3278901 3280110 Oh. There's a loose one.
3280194 3282612 Always in the middle.<br />That's where you wanna go.
3282697 3284072 Can I use your john real quick?
3284157 3286575 Of course.<br />It's the end of the hall, next to our...
3287743 3289953 (BREATHES DEEPLY)
3290121 3291830 My bedroom.
3293332 3294374 Okay.
3316898 3318565 Oh, no, Gary.
3346219 3349721 So, Sarah, how long have you two<br />been a couple?
3350556 3353058 Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...
3353142 3356269 We work together. I wouldn't, um...<br />I wouldn't do that thing.
3356354 3361858 I see. I thought I detected a certain<br />chemistry between the two of you.
3361943 3364528 - (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)<br />- No. No way.
3365154 3367322 - No, that's not...<br />- Mmm. Mmm.
3367657 3371284 Then again, I'm not the best judge<br />of chemistry in the world. (CHUCKLES)

3414579 3416121 Um, maybe... Ooh...

3419083 3420625 - No!<br />- Please! No?

3457872 3460665 Oh, Brooks. What have you<br />gotten yourself into?
3477975 3482020 Oh, shit. Where did you<br />come from, little guy?
3483397 3487275 Son of a bitch.<br />Hey! What are you, a vampire?
3487526 3490153 Oh, God. Oh, God.
3493032 3496409 Oh, my God. Has that got it?
3496577 3500455 No, that doesn't got it.<br />God damn it. Come on!
3504960 3505960 No!
3507838 3508838 I should go check on him.
3508923 3510215 - (ALL EXCLAIM)<br />- I think he's fine.
3510549 3513551 - He cried out.<br />- SARAH: Tell me about Debbie.
3516389 3517639 I beg your pardon.
3518349 3522852 Oh, just I... I never met her.<br />I'd love to hear all about her.
3533781 3535240 Where do I begin?
3535408 3537992 All right, you wanna take a bath?<br />We'll take a little bath.
3538160 3542956 There we go. Okay.<br />All right. Here we go.
3545209 3548044 There we go, huh? Huh?
3549505 3550714 Oh, it's so much worse.

3571277 3573611 Let's get home, get to bed, huh?<br />Get out of his hair.
3573696 3575864 We haven't finished the game.<br />It's your turn, Max.
3576031 3577282 Oh, my turn, huh?
3577450 3579951 Okay, be careful now, Max.<br />Oh! (GROANS)
3580035 3581745 Well, game over. I went in a little hot.

3603809 3605435 I don't know. I'm gonna figure it out.
3606520 3609147 "Unknown Caller. " Please don't be Gary.
3609231 3611858 - Hello?<br />- MAN: (DISTORTED) We have your brother.
3612735 3613860 Um...
3613944 3615487 Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,
3615571 3616696 and we're actually<br />on our way there right now.
3616781 3618490 We can do a swap, okay?<br />Please don't hurt Brooks.
3618574 3622494 <i>Meet us on the East 4th Street bridge<br />at midnight. If you're late, he dies.</i>
3622578 3623995 - Oh, my God.<br />- Um...
3624580 3627123 Boy, that's less than an hour from now.
3628542 3629626 Hello?
3629710 3632879 What's up with this guy's voice?<br />He sounds like a monster.
3633047 3634798 He's using a voice changer, Ryan.
3634882 3637217 He still sounds like a scary monster.
3640513 3644265 KEVIN: And we are here.
3644892 3645892 All right. You guys head home,
3645976 3647227 and I will call as soon<br />as I get the egg, all right?
3647311 3649479 What? Wait a second. Wait.<br />I'm going with you.
3649647 3651648 No, Annie. It could be very, very<br />dangerous in there, okay?
3651732 3653942 Listen, Brooks shouldn't have<br />dragged any of us into this,
3654026 3655735 but he is my brother,<br />and it's up to me to fix it.
3655820 3657862 No, bullshit!<br />We're all in this together!
3657947 3660073 No, no, no. Max is right.<br />You guys should go home,
3660241 3662450 but you and I are doing this.
3662618 3664953 Okay, what happens<br />if you guys don't make it out?
3665037 3667330 We don't come to game night because<br />we're dying to play charades and shit.
3667414 3668665 We come because we love you guys.
3668749 3670875 Honestly, this is<br />the best part of our week.
3670960 3674128 Mine, too. And I have<br />a lot of options on the weekend.
3674213 3676297 Wow. You guys...
3676382 3678383 Thank you. That's very nice.
3679134 3680927 Aw, good friends.
3681595 3684848 You should probably go, though, right?<br />I mean, you don't even know us.
3685224 3686808 Yeah, why are you still here?
3686892 3690228 Oh, I don't know.<br />I just got caught up in it.
3690312 3692313 Also, if I go home now,
3692398 3694148 and then I read in the newspaper<br />tomorrow that you all died,
3694233 3698194 I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,<br />so I'm gonna stick around.
3698946 3700989 You still read the newspaper?
3701156 3702949 That's what you got from that?
3703033 3705034 How are we gonna get into this place?
3706871 3708913 Go! Go! Go! Go!
3715379 3716838 Okay. (SHUSHING)

3799338 3802173 Okay, minimum buy in is now 10 grand.
3802341 3803716 Okay, I think we should split up.
3803884 3805009 Yeah. And let's start upstairs.
3805177 3807011 Anybody finds the egg,<br />just text the others, okay?
3807179 3808972 And for God's sake, be careful with it.<br />All right?
3809056 3810056 Got you. I got it.
3810140 3811265 ANNIE: Be safe.
3813435 3814727 What are you...<br />What are you doing?
3814895 3816145 Who says the egg isn't in here?
3817147 3819941 Also, I have a really good feeling<br />about Logan.
3820109 3823361 Egg, egg, egg.<br />Wow! This is some bedroom.
3823529 3825029 Does it remind you<br />of your celebrity boyfriend's?
3825197 3826364 Are you still on this?
3826490 3829033 Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.<br />That's all I can think about.
3829118 3830201 And that's saying a lot,
3830285 3833413 considering we got Eyes Wide Fight Club<br />going on downstairs.
3833580 3835373 Why is this so important to you?
3835541 3839127 Because, Michelle, look,<br />I am losing my mind here. Okay?
3839294 3840670 We were broken up at the time.
3840838 3844173 I got a hand job from Karen Waller,<br />so you had every right to.
3844341 3845633 So why not just tell me?
3847720 3849762 Okay, fine.
3851515 3853016 <i>It was 10 years ago.</i>
3853183 3856936 <i>I was at a gas station,<br />and I noticed a guy at the next pump.</i>
3858772 3862233 <i>It was Denzel Washington.</i>
3862484 3863735 Hold up.
3865237 3867321 It actually was Denzel?
3867406 3868489 Yeah.
3872703 3874412 <i>He was really nice.</i>
3874496 3878291 <i>He made some joke about how premium gas<br />is probably the same as regular.</i>
3878375 3880960 <i>I took a chance, and I asked him<br />if he wanted to get drinks.</i>
3881045 3882295 <i>He said yes.</i>
3882921 3884422 <i>We both got a little tipsy.</i>
3884506 3886299 <i>I offered to pay for drinks,<br />and he let me,</i>
3886383 3887884 <i>which I thought was pretty cool.</i>
3889386 3891721 <i>We danced for hours.</i>
3894433 3896059 <i>Eventually, we ended up<br />back at his place,</i>
3896143 3899062 <i>and one thing led to another.</i>
3901023 3903941 It was just<br />this crazy thing that happened,
3904026 3905735 and, in a weird way, it made me realize
3905819 3909238 the only person<br />I ever wanna be with is you.
3911075 3912075 Nah.
3912576 3914035 Nah. I don't believe it.
3914328 3915953 - Oh, you...<br />- Mmm-mmm. (CHUCKLES)
3916038 3917914 Well, I took a picture with him<br />at the club.
3918082 3919832 I put it in a hidden folder.
3920918 3922043 Denzel and Michelle.
3927841 3929300 Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.
3929593 3930843 Yeah, it is.
3931011 3932178 Mmm. No, it's not.
3932262 3934639 Dude looks a lot like Denzel,
3935390 3936474 but, uh, it's not him.
3936642 3938851 You're crazy. That's...<br />Look at that, that's Denzel.
3939019 3940937 Okay, let me ask you this.<br />Did he say he was Denzel?
3941105 3942522 Well, no.
3943440 3946067 He tried to introduce himself,<br />and I cut him off
3946151 3948486 because I told him I knew who he was.
3951031 3953116 - What kind of car did he drive?<br />- A BMW.
3953200 3954450 - Hmm.<br />- Three series.
3954535 3957245 Mmm. What was his place like?
3958038 3960414 It... It was a two-bedroom condo.
3962376 3966796 And he used the, um, spare room<br />as an office, so...
3967339 3968923 Do you hear<br />what you're saying right now?
3969091 3970633 Hold on, let me see. (CLEARS THROAT)
3971635 3973845 KEVIN: When you zoom in,<br />the nose gives it away, right?
3975097 3976389 - God damn!<br />- Mmm-hmm.
3976473 3979475 Look, don't beat yourself up about it,<br />okay? There is some good news.
3979643 3982353 (IMITATES DENZEL WASHINGTON)<br />If you wanna get with Denzel, huh,
3982437 3984480 he's standing right here!

3992072 3997201 I mean, how does this monster have<br />five kids? We don't get to have one.
3997911 4000121 Well, his wife looks like<br />she's about 15.
4000247 4003541 Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.
4003709 4005918 Right, right. No, I know, honey.<br />We're just gonna...
4006086 4009672 We're gonna keep plugging away<br />until something sticks, okay?
4009756 4012508 Gee, you really sound like a guy<br />who wants to have a kid.
4012634 4013676 Well, you know, I'm just...
4013802 4016929 I'm a little distracted right now,<br />honey, as you might imagine.
4017014 4020725 Look, if you're not into this,<br />you kind of gotta tell me.
4021310 4022310 Listen.
4023020 4026147 I wanna have a baby,<br />but how do I explain this? Um...
4027482 4030026 Do you remember how we used to play<br />Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes,
4030110 4031152 and we could play all night?
4031236 4033446 Do you remember, this one time,<br />I made it all the way up to level 86,
4033530 4035823 - and you were not too far behind, right?<br />- Eighty-five, but...
4035908 4037366 And then I kicked your ass at Galaga.
4037451 4039285 - So anyway, what is the point?<br />- Mmm... Anyway,
4039369 4041287 do you remember<br />how we stayed alive so long?
4041371 4043289 All we did was we ate the pellets.
4043373 4046083 We never ate the fruit<br />because the fruit is how they get you.
4047920 4049295 Oh, you're doing a metaphor!
4049379 4050838 Yes, but here's the problem.
4050923 4053382 No matter how long you and I<br />stayed alive in the game,
4053467 4055301 neither one of us ever made it<br />up to the leader board.
4056845 4058763 And you think if we have a baby,
4058847 4060223 we'll be officially settling down,
4060307 4062725 and you'll never make it<br />onto the leader board of life?
4062809 4064393 That's such a good metaphor.
4064478 4066771 Yeah, no, it's not.<br />It's kind of bullshit.
4066855 4067855 Why?
4067940 4069732 - What are we, 16 years old?<br />- No.
4069900 4072568 You wanna go backpacking<br />through Europe? Huh?
4072736 4075571 You wanna, like, have some wine coolers<br />on a football field
4075656 4077323 with Rebecca De Mornay?
4077491 4079158 Not specifically.
4079326 4081869 You know<br />who's always gone for the fruit, Max?
4082037 4086249 Your criminal brother, and that is why<br />the ghosts are about to eat him!
4086416 4088125 Look who's embracing the metaphor.
4088210 4089669 I'm so... I'm... Wow.
4090170 4092838 You know what? All this time,<br />I've just been thinking
4092923 4097051 that if I helped you beat Brooks,<br />you would be less stressed.
4097135 4100596 But you don't wanna beat Brooks.<br />You wanna be Brooks.

4317439 4320858 So, you don't wanna have a baby,<br />so we can do more shit like that?
4321651 4323652 No. No.
4323945 4326197 Is that the fruit<br />you were thinking about?
4326364 4328240 Mmm-mmm.<br />That's not the fruit. No.
4328408 4329909 Hey, thanks for the assist.
4330076 4331577 Yeah.
4332037 4334413 I don't even know why<br />I really did it. (CHUCKLES)
4335123 4336624 Do you think<br />it's 'cause you're falling for me?
4336791 4338209 (BOTH LAUGH)
4339169 4340169 I...
4341046 4342713 Not... Not sure.
4343048 4345633 Ugh. I was joking.
4345800 4347343 Oh. Okay. Yeah.
4348386 4350346 Aren't you gonna say<br />you were joking, too?
4350514 4351764 Do you want me to?
4351932 4353182 - Oh, my God, you're making this weird.<br />- No, I'm not.
4353350 4354892 - Stop it.<br />- Okay, fine.
4354976 4356936 It's two minutes to 12:00.<br />Where the hell is this bridge?
4357062 4360105 GPS says it's right around here,<br />but I don't see it.
4360190 4361982 Oh, oh. Oh. There it is. 4th Street.

4372035 4374161 That's great.<br />Now they're gonna kill my brother.
4376206 4377289 ANNIE: Oh, God!
4377832 4379250 Hold on.
4380252 4383420 I'm not an expert,<br />but these gems look plastic to me.
4383505 4385714 "Made in China. "<br />Is this thing not even real?
4385799 4387591 Maybe just that sticker<br />was made in China.
4387676 4388717 - Let's let them talk.<br />- MAX: Can I see?
4389052 4391845 <i>KEVIN: Hey, why would the Bulgarian<br />ask Brooks to bring him a fake egg?</i>
4391930 4394932 Uh, I don't think he wanted<br />an egg at all.
4395016 4398018 I think he wanted<br />what was inside the egg.
4398979 4401063 "WITSEC." What is that?
4401189 4402231 Um...
4402315 4403983 We could ask them?
4421334 4423210 VAL: You tell anyone<br />we were coming here?
4423378 4424670 No.
4424838 4426005 I've got your egg.
4426089 4427089 You do?
4427173 4428632 Yeah, but we broke it.
4428800 4430259 - What?<br />- Well, it was a fake.
4430343 4431927 But we have the list of names<br />that was inside.
4432012 4433387 That's what you wanted, right?
4436808 4438892 Okay. Get on the ground.
4438977 4440769 We've got what you want.<br />Can't you just let us go?
4440854 4443105 I said, "On the ground!"
4444024 4445774 You, too, playboy, get over there.<br />Get on the ground.
4445859 4446942 COLIN: Yeah.
4447027 4448152 <i>VAL: None of that<br />child pose bullshit, either.</i>
4449446 4451989 The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,<br />probably you guys, too.
4452157 4453407 Why did you come here?
4453700 4455409 Because you're my brother,<br />and I can't just let you die,
4455493 4456577 even though you might deserve it.
4456661 4458787 Yeah, it's me. We got them all here.
4458955 4461540 You're unbelievable, you know that?
4461708 4463876 You've always<br />been a better person than me.
4464044 4465628 You gotta shut up. Okay?
4465795 4468714 Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.
4468882 4471550 I'm not the carefree dude<br />that wins at everything he touches.
4471635 4474094 You know how I win?<br />I cheat. I cheat at everything.
4474179 4476263 I even cheated when we were kids<br />playing Battleship.
4478016 4479224 What?
4479309 4482811 Didn't you ever wonder why I made you<br />sit with your back to the TV?
4482896 4485689 It was so I could see your ships<br />in the reflection.
4485774 4489276 I mean, I even took five grand<br />every time we played Monopoly
4489361 4490861 before we even started playing the game.
4491029 4494448 I cheated at the Game ofLife.<br />And at the game of life.
4494616 4495908 You son of a bitch.
4495992 4498202 <i>- You son of a bitch!<br />- VAL: Sit down.</i>
4499287 4501163 - What about you, Princess?<br />- I don't have anything.
4501331 4504750 But it didn't stop there<br />because, when we grew up, Max,
4504834 4507127 you went off to college, and I...
4508213 4510255 You got a career.
4510423 4513050 You married the greatest girl<br />in the world.
4513218 4515052 I knew I couldn't keep up<br />with that success.
4515220 4517096 So I...
4517263 4519390 I told everyone that I got a job<br />on Wall Street.
4519557 4520974 And I did.
4521142 4523936 Selling coke to traders.
4525271 4526438 You didn't invest in Panera?
4526606 4527981 I ate at Panera.
4528149 4529733 Jesus Christ.
4529818 4531610 VAL: What's going on?
4531695 4533487 But that's why I've been trying<br />to make it up to you.
4533571 4534863 That's what this whole game night<br />was about.
4534948 4537950 See, I had it rigged<br />so that you'd finally win.
4538993 4541912 The last clue was gonna lead you...
4541996 4543330 Your jacket pocket.
4553091 4554508 ANNIE: Huh.
4556928 4558679 Surprise! (CHUCKLES)
4561891 4564852 I even managed to fuck that up, though.<br />I'm so sorry.
4564936 4566937 I'm so sorry, Max. (SIGHS)
4567689 4568731 (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
4568815 4570941 I think we're gonna be okay, though.<br />I got a feeling.
4571025 4572234 You want us to kill them all?
4573319 4574361 What?
4574446 4576029 - Okay.<br />- ANNIE: Wait, wait. Just let us go.
4576114 4577239 We won't tell anyone anything.
4577323 4578949 - We got you the list!<br />- (SIRENS APPROACHING)
4579284 4581702 - What the fuck, man?<br />- COLIN: Fuck! God damn it!
4583705 4584955 - Oh, shit. The fuzz.<br />- Fuck, man!
4585039 4586373 Freeze!
4586583 4587624 MAX: Gary?
4587709 4588751 Don't even think about it, pig.
4588835 4590419 Can't say I care for that nomenclature.
4590670 4591712 (YELLS)
4591796 4592838 (ALL GASPING)
4593673 4594798 MAX: Get down!

4617447 4618489 RYAN: Oh, my God!
4618573 4619698 Everybody okay?
4619783 4621408 - You're a cool-ass cat, Gary.<br />- You all right?
4621493 4623076 Fine, thank you,
4623870 4627581 though, in sliding, my belt buckle<br />may have inadvertently scratched
4627665 4629249 the finish of my squad car.
4629334 4630918 How did you know we were in trouble?
4631002 4633170 The nocturnal Jenga game,
4634047 4636256 my blood-spattered marital souvenirs,
4636341 4640010 and Max's curious search history<br />piqued my interest.
4640094 4642429 - Right. Oh, God.<br />- You, uh...
4642514 4644223 You saved our lives.
4644307 4645474 Thank you.
4646100 4647351 - Just doing my job.<br />- (GUNSHOT)

4657862 4659321 ANNIE: Oh, shit!<br />MAX: Hang in there, pal.
4659405 4660739 <i>Hang on. Hang on, pal.</i>
4660824 4661949 Hang on. You're gonna be all right.
4662033 4663158 We're gonna get you to a hospital.
4663243 4664868 Okay, look at me. Gary, look.
4664953 4666912 You have got a lot to live for, okay?
4666996 4667996 Do I?
4668081 4669540 MAX: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br />ANNIE: Yeah.
4669624 4671500 I have no wife.
4672961 4674628 - No friends.<br />- MAX: That's not true.
4674796 4675921 No, don't say that.
4676089 4677798 - You got us. We're your friends.<br />- You've got us.
4677966 4682427 You don't even like<br />spending time with me.
4682512 4683846 Yes, we do. We just...
4683930 4685597 We've been a little selfish. That's all.
4685682 4687349 - Right, right.<br />- You know, I'm sorry about that.
4687433 4688433 Oh, God. Oh, God.
4688518 4690310 - (WEAKLY) Bastian.<br />- MAX: Huh?
4691688 4694273 Someone please take care of Bastian.
4694357 4697526 Gary, you are gonna take care of Bastian<br />yourself, okay?
4697610 4698735 Listen, soon as you get out<br />of the hospital,
4698820 4700445 you're gonna come to every single<br />game night we have.
4701990 4703323 Don't...
4703700 4704741 MAX: Yeah?
4704826 4707744 Don't you ever
4709581 4711582 exclude me again.
4711666 4714543 - Never exclude you again, pal.<br />- ANNIE: No.
4716337 4718630 - Oh, God. What is that?<br />- What's that?
4718715 4720674 ANNIE: Is that a blood clot?
4721259 4723552 It's a blood capsule.
4723636 4725304 - ANNIE: Huh?<br />- A blood capsule?
4726180 4729933 And that is how<br />you do a game night. (CHUCKLES)
4733563 4734646 What?
4736774 4738400 I've duped you all.
4738484 4739484 MICHELLE: Wha...
4740403 4743697 Hold on a second. Are you telling me<br />that this whole thing was a game?
4744032 4746158 - (BOTH GRUNTING)<br />- (SCREAMS)

4747577 4748577 SARAH: Shit!
4748661 4750412 I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.
4750496 4752706 When I learned you stopped inviting me<br />to your game nights,
4752790 4755584 I hijacked<br />Brooks's murder mystery party,
4755668 4757502 and I staged a kidnapping of my own.
4757587 4759087 You gotta be kidding me.
4759172 4762341 What better way to prove my worth<br />as a game night participant?
4762425 4764468 Well, what about these dudes?<br />Are they actors?
4764552 4766511 Oh, no. They're... They're felons.
4766596 4767596 Felons?
4767680 4769264 I was able to shave some time off<br />of their parole
4769349 4771558 in exchange<br />for this little side project.
4771809 4772935 We square now?
4773019 4774311 Thank you, gentlemen.
4774395 4775687 That lady hit me with the car.
4775772 4777314 Hey, what the hell kind of psycho<br />are you?
4777398 4779983 You put us through all this,<br />just for your own amusement?
4780068 4783445 No, no. Just the opposite.<br />For your amusement.
4783529 4784696 Did everyone have fun?
4784781 4786448 ALL: No! No.<br />RYAN: Yeah. No.
4786532 4788158 No fun! I got shot!
4788242 4789326 By me!
4789410 4791954 I don't see how that's possible.<br />My men were using blanks.
4792038 4793997 Well, that was my gun.<br />It was a real gun.
4794082 4796750 So, this whole thing, the Faberg� egg,
4796834 4798377 the Bulgarian, that was you?
4800046 4801129 You've lost me.
4801214 4803340 The egg, the WITSEC list?
4803424 4805467 It's all you. All part of your game?
4809097 4811598 This is a list of people in<br />the Federal Witness Protection program.
4811683 4812808 How did you get this?
4812892 4815268 From inside the egg.<br />Stop fucking with us. It's over!
4815353 4818063 I'm not fudging with you.<br />I honestly have no idea what... (GROANS)
4820066 4822442 Oh, boy. Yikes!
4823319 4825028 - I mean, how stupid do you think we are?<br />- Hey, Max.
4825113 4827155 Gang, are we looking<br />at the big twist here?
4827240 4828740 He gets shot again!
4828825 4831451 And by who? A couple of new characters<br />you introduce at the last minute.
4831536 4833036 Dude, you've jumped the shark!
4833121 4834705 Do you go to the magic shop
4834789 4836581 - to buy a bunch of these little bullets?<br />- No. (SCREAMS)
4839127 4840460 Hang on.
4840545 4843505 This is Officer Kingsbury.<br />We got a 10-00 on the 4th Street.
4843589 4844589 - (GROANS)<br />- (ALL GASP)
4846509 4848760 Which one of you is Brooks Davis?
4851556 4854182 It's funny.<br />You don't look like an asshole.
4854976 4857019 Do I look like an asshole to you?
4857562 4858645 No.
4858730 4860981 One of us has to be the asshole<br />in this transaction
4861065 4863692 because otherwise I'd have my egg,<br />and you'd have your money.
4863776 4867112 But instead, we've wasted our night<br />tracking you down.
4868865 4870615 Now, we're gonna have to kill you.
4870700 4872325 - What? No, no, no, no.<br />- What?
4872660 4874119 Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?
4874287 4877164 Hi, I'm Max. (STAMMERS)<br />I'm Brooks's brother.
4877248 4879332 And, you know, look. He screwed up.
4879417 4880584 - Right? You got greedy.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4880668 4881710 He admits it.
4881794 4883670 Good news is, though,<br />that we got your egg.
4884172 4886506 It is broken. Uh, my screw up.
4886591 4889092 But, um, I got the list.
4889177 4890969 <i>which I bet you've been after<br />this whole time.</i>
4891054 4892054 What about this?
4892138 4894056 How about
4894682 4898685 you take this list for free,<br />and we all go our separate ways?
4898770 4900729 Nobody gets hurt.
4900813 4903774 Uh, except the poor folks on this list,<br />I'm guessing.
4904192 4905400 (CHUCKLES)
4905943 4907069 Okay.
4907779 4908779 Okay?
4908863 4911448 Deal. Makes perfect sense.
4911532 4913283 No, no. You give him that list,<br />he's gonna kill me.
4913576 4914868 (LAUGHING) That's nonsense.
4916329 4917329 (GULPS)
4917789 4919623 What the hell is wrong with you?
4920124 4922084 I'm just trying to buy myself some time.
4922168 4925253 Not much. We're just gonna<br />cut it out of you on the jet. Take him.
4928800 4930467 Don't follow us, Max. I'm serious!
4930551 4932677 I'm not worried about that.
4934222 4935472 (MICHELLE YELPING)
4936307 4937808 You just letting them go?
4937892 4939976 Yeah, they've done nothing wrong.
4940061 4942062 Only this one.
4942396 4943855 - Let's go.<br />- Don't follow us!
4943940 4945941 Gary! He's breathing.
4947110 4949319 You know, the only private air terminal<br />around here is at Conway.
4949403 4950946 Yeah. How are we gonna get there?
4951489 4952864 Brooks's house is<br />not that far from here.
4952949 4954074 But our car's not there.
4955284 4956451 Yeah, it is.
4966337 4969047 You know, you don't have to do this<br />because I can just poop it out.
4969882 4973218 We're not gonna go digging<br />through your feces. That's disgusting!
4973302 4975345 Now, hold still<br />while I cut your stomach open.
4975429 4976763 No, no! No! Whoa!
4978057 4979307 What the hell?
4981602 4983395 - Is that...<br />- That's my brother.
4983479 4985021 Get us in the air.
4985106 4986106 Now!
4997243 4998285 - Hold on!<br />- Oh!
5001914 5003206 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, you?
5003291 5004416 - Yup, good.<br />- Okay.
5009088 5010672 Okay, okay. What's our plan?
5010756 5012174 (STAMMERS) I have one idea.
5012258 5014509 It's so crazy, though, baby,<br />it just might work.
5014594 5015719 You're gonna<br />crash the car into the plane,
5015803 5017637 like Liam Neeson in Taken 3?
5018014 5019598 He did that in Taken 3, huh?
5024145 5025896 - All right, are you ready? Here we go!<br />- Uh-huh.

5173085 5174252 You saw what I was going for,<br />though, right?
5174337 5175337 Yeah, yeah.
5175421 5177672 But then did you see when I hit him<br />with the fire extinguisher?
5177757 5179966 - I sure did. I sure did, yeah.<br />- That was cool, right? Yeah.
5180051 5181134 - Yeah.<br />- Great.
5181218 5182218 Do you want this?
5182303 5184512 Well, I don't want you to have it,<br />Calamity Jane.
5184597 5185805 All right, look.
5185890 5188141 I think I saw a hatch<br />at the top of the plane.
5188225 5189559 Maybe I can get the drop on him.
5189643 5191061 - "The drop"?<br />- Yup, yeah.
5191145 5192145 Who are you?
5192229 5193271 Why don't you go use<br />the emergency phone? Call for help.

5361106 5362232 Uh, what?
5362316 5363566 I used to think that<br />I wanted Brooks' life,
5363651 5365318 but, you know, turns out he was just...
5365402 5366945 You're a loser. He's a loser.
5367029 5368071 Uh, guilty.
5368155 5369697 But us making a family?
5369865 5372909 That's... That's not pellets.<br />That's the fruit.
5373077 5374786 That's fruit. It's fruit.
5374870 5376204 Wait. What's going on?
5376497 5378748 Plus, think about all the dumdums<br />that have kids, right?
5378832 5381417 And think about how much better<br />our kid is gonna be than their kids.
5381502 5383378 It's gonna beat their kids<br />at everything.
5383462 5385004 It's taken you this long to see that?
5385089 5387006 Our baby is gonna crush<br />every other baby.
5387091 5389008 That's right. That's right.<br />And not in that "peak too early,"
5389093 5390301 you know, "kid actor" kind of way,<br />you know?
5390386 5391386 Mmm-mmm. No.
5391470 5393429 We will parcel out<br />his or her gifts over time.
5393514 5394597 - Absolutely.<br />- Yes.
5394682 5395974 We gotta teach it Mandarin right away.
5396058 5397058 'Cause China's the future.
5397142 5398393 - It sure is.<br />- Yeah.

5410698 5411698 It went exactly as I planned.
5411782 5414867 You learned every lesson<br />that I wanted you to.
5414952 5416786 Trevor, you can get up now.
5422001 5424669 I'm just fucking with you, but that<br />would've been really cool, right?

5448986 5450194 - Can I get you a beer?<br />- Uh, yeah.
5450279 5451821 - Come on!<br />- Hey, listen, Brooks.
5452239 5454949 I know you're probably feeling<br />pretty humbled by all of this.
5455034 5458328 But, honestly, I think you're gonna come<br />out the other side a much better man.
5458704 5459871 Oh! Hey, look.
5459955 5461372 I completely agree.
5461457 5463124 You remember the WITSEC list<br />I swallowed?
5463208 5464417 - Sure.<br />- I pooped it out,
5464501 5467211 sold it for $3 million<br />on the black market.
5468088 5469922 - Are you serious?<br />- Pretty sweet, huh?
5470633 5472634 Brooks, everybody on that list<br />is gonna get killed.
5472801 5474135 Oh, no, Max, I'm not a monster.
5474303 5476512 I tipped everyone off<br />that they were in danger.
5476680 5478640 For $20,000 apiece.
5479767 5481017 - (LAUGHING)<br />- You're unbelievable.
5481101 5483561 Thank you. It's not like<br />I'm gonna live in this dump forever.
5483646 5486272 As soon as this cuff comes off,<br />I'm gonna buy that house I was renting.
5486357 5487690 I'm moving in with Johanna.

5506877 5509337 This is me at the Regal Cinema crying
5509421 5511923 as I did through much of the film.
5513008 5514467 How were we supposed to know that, Gary?
5514635 5517845 I assume everyone cried<br />during The Green Mile.
5518806 5519806 So, who's next?
5519890 5520890 I'll go.
5520974 5522266 - Yeah!<br />- MAX: Go, baby!
