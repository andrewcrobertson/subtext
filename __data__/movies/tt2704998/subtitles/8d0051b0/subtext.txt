41360 44751 Whoo!
44840 47036 Who cares about<br />winning? Let's get drunk!
47720 49200 Let's do it.
49280 51749 Let's get you drunk, Merkins.<br />You, too, Borgs.
51840 53672 I'm thirsty. Huh?
54880 57190 I need four shots of vodka,<br />four shots of water.
57280 59112 I want you to send the vodka<br />over to the Merkins.
59200 60919 Send the water to us. You understand?
61000 62639 <i>What former<br />Supreme Court Justice...</i>
62720 64313 - Oliver Wendell Holmes!<br /><i>- Correct.</i>
64400 65754 Yes!
65840 68480 <i>Again, I'd like to ask the players<br />to allow me to...</i>
68560 70199 To finish the question.
70360 71714 <i>Very funny.</i>
71920 73912 Okay, okay.<br />This is getting embarrassing,
74000 75878 so we need to focus
76040 77474 because this isn't a game.
77680 79160 It literally is.
79320 81596 Bill, do not test me right now.
81680 83114 <i>Looks like<br />we're down to two teams.</i>
83760 85911 <i>So, for double points,</i>
86000 88276 <i>what is the name<br />of the purple Teletubby?</i>
89080 91640 - Tinky Winky!<br /><i>- You're both correct.</i>
93120 94759 He always carried a...
94920 96673 - Red purse.<br />- Yeah.
96840 99480 - And he loved big hugs.<br />- Big hugs.
99640 101552 I know. I'm Max.
101720 103074 Annie.
121120 122998 Ha-ha! You're never gonna be able<br />to hold on to Asia! You hear me?
123160 125311 Hey, if you take Kamchatka,<br />and I take Mongolia,
125520 126749 we could trap Linda in the middle.
126920 127910 <i>- Starve out her armies.</i><br />- Hey!
128080 129230 You can't form alliances.
129440 131079 Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?
131240 132959 You're high-fiving Hitler?
135280 137112 <i>All right, you got this. Last one.</i>
137800 140440 Oh, that's <i>Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.</i>
140640 141790 Yes!
141960 142950 I'm up. I feel good.
143160 144196 Two words.
144360 145874 Bill. Overweight.
146080 147196 - No.<br />- Single. Out of work.
147280 148270 What the fuck?
148360 149680 Hairy.
149840 151320 Uh, carry, marry.
151480 152550 Marry!
152720 154359 You. Me.
154440 155430 Marry me?
155520 157113 Dude, we got it! We got it!
157640 159711 Annie, will you?
159800 161280 Will you marry me?
161360 162794 - Is that a yes? That's a yes!<br />- Yeah!
162960 165111 I'm really happy for you guys.
179000 180639 - Ooh, lot of pressure here.<br />- Yeah.
180800 182075 You miss, you lose it all.
182200 183236 Stay out of my head.
183320 185198 And you know you have a distinct<br />advantage with the smaller hands, right?
185280 186760 Your goal posts are not as big.
186920 188639 Well, I guess you<br />should've married Uma Thurman.
188720 189870 Yeah, that would've been great.
190000 192151 There's a snap. Here's the hold.
192800 194280 - Ooh!<br />- And a text.
194360 195555 That was interference.
195640 197233 <i>Sorry, honey. I know how much<br />that meant to you.</i>
197320 198879 Come on.
198960 200280 Dr. Chin is ready for you.
200360 201430 Uh, great.
201520 204194 I think we've determined why you've<br />been having trouble conceiving.
204360 206955 - Okay. Let's have it.<br />- Okay, great.
207120 209316 Oh, what's that look? Is it me?<br />Of course, it's me.
209400 211471 I'm not loving your semen.
211560 212630 Oh?
212720 215713 <i>Your count is excellent,<br />but your motility is well below normal.</i>
215880 217758 - That's too bad.<br />- What would cause that?
217920 220754 It can be genetic,<br />environmental factors.
220920 223230 Nine times out of 10, though,<br />it's psychological.
223400 225915 Have you been feeling<br />anxious or stressed?
226120 228237 No, I don't think so. Not really.
228400 229880 Uh... He's always a little stressed.
230800 231870 You don't have to write... I'm not...
232080 233150 Honey, she's writing it down.
233360 236592 Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.
236720 237710 We sure are.
237840 239274 One of the reasons<br />I fell in love with him.
239440 243275 Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more<br />prone to stress than normal people.
243440 245352 "Normal people"?
245440 246635 How long has this been going on, Max?
246800 247995 It's not going on.
248480 250949 Oh, well, you did say,<br />even when you were a kid,
251040 253111 you would freak out<br />if you lost at anything.
253560 255677 - Oh, I was a kid.<br />- Especially if you lost to your brother.
255840 256956 Hmm.
257600 259398 Hey, is that what this is?
259480 260470 No.
260560 264270 You have been so uptight since you<br />found out that Brooks is coming to town.
264360 265874 - I don't think that's true.<br />- Could that be a factor in all this?
265960 266950 Let's be fair.
267040 269350 Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.
269440 271511 Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.
271680 273273 - The what?<br />- The brothers.
273440 276000 I'm not sure why we're discussing this.<br />She's not a therapist.
276160 278152 You're not a therapist, right?<br />With all respect.
278320 279834 - No, but I am a doctor.<br />- Sure.
279920 281877 And I believe in<br />treating the whole patient.
281960 285032 So, what is it about your brother<br />that makes you feel emasculated?
285200 286634 Are we gonna do this?
286800 288439 We're right next to the room<br />where I masturbated.
288640 292031 I think he has it in his head<br />that Brooks is cooler
292120 295192 and more successful<br />and hotter than he is.
295280 296555 I never said hotter.
296720 298200 He's charming.
298400 300676 That's interesting. And is he single?
300840 301830 What's that?
301920 305197 I don't know if I mentioned it, but<br />Keith and I are on a trial separation.
305280 306600 - Oh.<br />- Keith?
307160 308196 Uh, Keith.
308280 310237 So, do you think your brother would<br />wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?
310560 311630 Gosh, I don't know.
311800 313200 Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.
313360 314794 Hurts a little.
315000 317390 Now, is he a tall fellow?<br />'Cause I'm only 5'2".
317560 318914 We're all done with my semen?
319080 320514 He is taller than Max.
320680 322911 <i>- Good.</i><br />- But he did date this ballerina once,
323000 324798 and she was<br />just a teeny-tiny little thing.
344000 345275 Ooh.
345360 347716 Honey, Gary.<br />Don't mention game night, okay?
347800 348836 Mmm-hmm.
348920 350718 - Good evening, Max.<br />- Hey, Gary.
350880 352075 - Annie.<br />- Hello there.
352240 353833 Hi, Gary!
354320 355834 Just checking the mail.
355920 356956 Oh, yeah?
357040 358474 <i>Some people check it earlier in the day,</i>
358640 362475 but there's always a risk<br />that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.
363480 367838 This spares me the chance<br />of a futile trip to the mailbox.
369480 370630 Uh-huh.
370720 375033 Plus, it allows Bastian here<br />the opportunity to urinate.
376120 377839 You have a good one.
378000 379195 Any plans for this evening?
379360 380635 No.
381280 382680 Perhaps a game night?
382840 384240 We're just gonna stay in,
384360 385635 - just the two of us.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
385720 387313 - Boring.<br />- Mmm.
387480 388800 I see.
390000 394836 I do hope you keep me in mind<br />for any future game nights.
395040 396030 You bet.
396120 399830 I've always enjoyed<br />the camaraderie of good friends
400040 402953 competing in games of chance and skill.
403520 406274 Yeah.<br />Yeah, well, we'll do that,
406440 410070 but tonight, it's just the two of us.
410680 413752 Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.
419640 421950 There was a special on these tonight.
422440 423590 Three for one.
423760 425160 Three for one?
425800 426836 Yup.
426920 429116 How can that be profitable<br />for Frito Lay?
430360 432238 These corporations,
433600 435432 I don't know what they're doing.
435840 438400 Well, you two enjoy each other.
439200 443672 It's often we don't appreciate<br />what we have until it's gone.
448080 449673 - I think that's it.<br />- Okay.
449880 450996 Bye-bye!
457280 459511 If Gary sees the others coming,<br />we're screwed.
459680 460796 No, no, honey,<br />it's not gonna be a problem.
460960 463077 I was very, very clear with everyone<br />to park far away
463240 465118 and just to sneak in quietly, you know.
465280 467795 But now, I mean, you don't think<br />we're being dicks, do you?
467960 469360 I mean,<br />should we just still invite the guy?
469440 470510 He really seemed like he wanted to play.
470680 472512 No, no. Debbie was our friend,
472680 474797 and Gary was just the creepy husband<br />that we had to put up with.
474880 475870 That's true.
475960 477360 He's only gotten worse<br />since the divorce.
477520 480274 Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?<br />Fuck him!
506880 507996 Hi!
508160 509560 Hi.
512960 514553 Can we help you?
514720 515915 I'm okay.
516280 517270 Hey!
517440 519238 Of course. Ryan, why are you<br />coming in through the window?
519400 522677 You said sneak in<br />so RoboCop wouldn't see us.
522840 524160 I meant sneak in through the door.
524320 525515 Well, you were super vague.
525680 526875 - I wasn't vague at all.<br />- Wine?
527040 528474 I know I didn't say,<br />"Break the succulents."
528640 530871 - Hey.<br />- I'm not dressed for this nonsense.
530960 531950 This is ridiculous.
532040 533030 It's like<br /><i>Night of the Living Dead</i> in here.
533120 534713 Yeah, you are asking a lot from us, Max.
534800 536075 I didn't say<br />to come through the window.
536240 537720 This is Max. We used to work together.
537880 538950 - His wife, Annie. Michelle.<br />- Hey!
539040 540030 And that guy, Kevin.
540120 541156 - What's up, buddy?<br />- The door was right there.
541240 542276 Guys, this is Madison.
542360 543714 Yeah, you brought her last week.
543880 545758 You work at Forever 21, right?
545920 547957 - No, no.<br />- I work at Sephora.
548040 550396 - I'm confused.<br />- Different girl.
550560 551880 Same look, same voice.
552040 553110 Nice to meet you.
553320 554754 You, too.
557080 558560 - That's yours.<br />- It's...
558720 560712 No. I think you're<br />supposed to kiss it, right?
560880 561916 Welcome.
562040 563474 Do you guys have a bathroom?
563640 564835 There's one just down the hall.<br />You need it?
565040 568192 Okay, is it on the right or the left?<br />I don't wanna go in the wrong room.
568360 569510 The one with the toilet.
569680 570750 - Can't miss it.<br />- Okay.
573560 574994 - Oh, boy.<br />- Dude!
575160 577197 - Wow. Where'd you find her? TED Talk?<br />- Right?
577360 578635 No, at Chipotle.
578800 579790 Let me ask you something, Ryan.
579880 581473 Aren't you sick of<br />losing game night every week
581600 582636 because of the dates you bring?
582800 584712 They're not always that bad.
587880 588916 Heather, seriously.
589000 590753 How many photos of you<br />with the dog filter do you need?
592880 595031 Uh... "Dennis" isn't a word.
595240 597800 Uh, yeah, it is.<br />It's my daddy's name, so...
597960 600714 These are the elite,<br />the very best, the...
600800 601870 Oh, oh! White people!
601960 603553 - What?<br />- Oh, Jesus.
603640 604835 Okay, unlike you psychos,
605040 606793 I don't give a shit<br />about winning game night.
607000 608480 I don't need that validation.
608640 610871 But you do need the validation<br />of dating Instagram models?
611040 612076 Absolutely.
612240 614550 I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br />I'm not like you, Michelle.
614720 617189 We didn't all meet our soul mate<br />when we were 10 years old.
617280 618270 14.
618360 619350 - Oh, sorry.<br />- 14.
619440 621159 And we didn't get married<br />until we were 19.
621240 622993 - See, that's gross.<br />- You know what, Ryan?
623080 625276 I hope one day you<br />get to meet a lovely, young lady.
625440 627750 So you can love her as much as<br />I love my sweet baby right here.
627920 629718 Yes, find her. Look how cute this...
629880 631109 - Hey, look at this.<br />- So much love.
631200 632190 Let's look at him when we do it.
632280 633634 - Hey, everybody, grab your drinks.<br /><i>- Find the love!</i>
633800 635029 Let's go play, come on.
635200 638477 Dude, do you know what rich people are<br />doing on their game nights these days?
638640 639960 What's that?
640160 641355 - Fight clubs.<br />- What?
641520 642670 I just read about them.
642840 644911 They pay poor people<br />to fight each other,
645040 646030 and then they bet on the winner.
646240 647879 - No, that's not a real thing.<br />- Yes, it is!
648080 649673 If you can have anything<br />you want in this world,
649840 651957 you have to raise the stakes,<br />or life gets boring.
652120 654237 <i>The Kennedys used to have fight clubs<br />at their compound.</i>
654400 657199 Honey, listen, you gotta stop reading<br />BuzzFeed every second of the damn day.
657360 658999 How about some charades?<br />Huh, should we start with charades?
659080 660070 <i>- Let's go!<br />- Yeah!</i>
660160 661310 It's been a while, huh?
661480 662880 Do you wanna wait for Brooks?
663040 664110 I don't think we need to. No, he's late.
664280 666556 - Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?<br /><i>- Yeah.</i>
666720 667790 I thought he was working in Europe.
667960 670316 He was, yeah. He's apparently back<br />for some business.
670520 671510 Haven't seen him yet.
671680 673831 - But we can get started.<br />- Yeah!
674000 675957 - Who wants to start?<br />- Who are you guys talking about?
676120 678760 Max's brother. He's this super<br />successful venture capitalist.
678920 681480 Yeah, he was the first to invest<br />in Panera Bread, you know?
681640 683359 The Fuji Apple Salad was his idea.
683520 684920 - A lot of investors.<br />- Yeah.
685120 686793 He's like the Mark Wahlberg<br />to Max's Donnie.
686880 687916 Well...
688040 689110 Which is a huge compliment
689200 691715 because Donnie was fucking great<br />in <i>The Sixth Sense,</i> wasn't he?
691800 692916 He was.
693000 694400 Was he in <i>The Sixth Sense?</i>
694560 696677 He sure is, yeah.<br />You know who is not in <i>The Sixth Sense?</i>
696880 697996 Mark Wahlberg.
698160 700595 Mark would never take a role that small.
702280 704397 Is that right, Madison?
704560 705835 Man, I haven't seen him<br />since the wedding.
706000 707992 - Remember that speech he gave?<br />- Yes.
708160 709594 And then he paid<br />for that whole firework display!
709760 710955 - Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!<br />- Little over the top.
711040 712633 Let's get started.<br />I'm gonna start us off.
712720 714154 - Yes, let's start!<br />- Here we go. Let's do it.
714240 715959 We gotta pick teams first.
716040 717076 <i>- Movie?<br />- It's a movie. Okay.</i>
717160 718799 <i>- Dude, we have no teams.<br />- You just give up?</i>
718960 720474 Better not be Brooks.
734800 736917 You didn't tell him<br />to park up the street?
737080 738480 I did, yeah, like, three times.
739320 740549 Hey!
741560 743791 He got a Stingray, huh?
747160 748594 Turn off your car!
748920 750115 What's that?
752840 754320 Hello, again.
754720 755836 Mmm...
755920 757673 Still wearing the uniform.
759080 760434 Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.
760600 762592 I hope you didn't start<br />game night without me.
764560 765710 Did you not get my text?
765880 767314 What text?
767760 769080 Oh, hello, Officer.
770920 772593 Why's that guy staring at us?
772760 774433 Gary, I want you<br />to meet my brother, Brooks.
774600 778071 We're having a little family<br />three-man game night tonight.
778240 779469 Wait, what do you mean three-man?
779640 781154 You said that Michelle<br />and Ryan and Kevin were...
781320 782800 No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.
782960 784076 I can see them in the doorway.
784240 786118 There's a whole mess of people.<br />Hey, guys!
786280 787714 - There they are.<br />- Hey!
787880 789155 These guys are leaving.
789240 790230 Take off, guys.
790320 792551 We had a little bit<br />of a mix-up with the, um...
793600 794875 - God damn it!<br />- What?
795040 796759 We didn't want him to know<br />that we're having a game night.
796920 800311 He used to come, and we don't<br />like him anymore, so...
800400 801629 Oh.
802040 803360 You know, I think he knows now.
803520 804670 He sure does.
804840 808277 Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.
808760 811514 I haven't seen you in a year!
811680 814639 Hey, you smell good.
814800 817998 What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?<br />Head and Shoulders?
818160 819753 Why do you assume<br />it's a dandruff shampoo?
819960 822191 Well, I mean, you've always<br />been a little bit of a snowstorm.
822360 823635 - Hey, would you hold that for a second?<br />- Yup.
823840 824910 Hey, guys!
825080 827595 Well, you look good, stranger.
827800 828790 It's been forever.
828960 830633 I know, and that's my fault.<br />I'm so sorry.
830960 832189 Sweet ride, Brooks.
832360 834158 Oh, you like that?<br />I just got her a couple weeks ago.
834320 835470 What is that? A Corvette?
835640 838553 It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.
838720 839915 It was my dream car as a kid.
840080 841992 And that's what<br />gave me the idea to get it.
842080 843958 You know what? I love your house.
845000 846116 Are you being sarcastic?
846320 847390 No, I mean I love your house.
847560 849199 It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.
849360 850794 Makes me think of simpler times.
850960 852314 "Simpler"?
852480 854392 Uh, so, how long are you in town for?
854480 855550 You know, I'm not sure.
855720 857120 It depends on how many clients
857200 859192 the firm's gonna be<br />having me schmooze while I'm here.
860400 861436 <i>But hopefully for a while.</i>
861520 863830 I don't get to see you guys, and I...
865600 868160 God, I really miss you, man.<br />I really do.
868240 869833 Oh.
870440 871920 Miss you, too, Brooks.
872280 873350 And go!
874160 875833 Shock-rocker. Dated Rose McGowan.
875920 877354 Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.
877560 878630 Yep. You got it.
878720 880632 - Quick story.<br />- There's no pausing.
880800 883360 You remember the urban myth where<br />Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out
883520 884590 so he could go down on himself?
884920 885956 Yeah.
886040 887315 You don't mind me telling the story,<br />do you, Max?
887480 888470 You're in the middle of a...
888640 890836 You were 14 years old.<br />It's an adorable story.
891000 891990 I forbid it.
892200 894351 I'm a little curious.
894520 896318 Did you blow yourself?
896600 898114 You know the bungee cords on roof racks?
898200 899190 Yeah.
899280 902318 Max took one of those bungee cords,<br />and he put it around his neck.
902480 903470 Here he goes.
903560 904880 And then he wrapped it behind his legs
904960 907236 so he could squish his face<br />down into his crotch,
907400 908914 <i>but the problem was</i>
909080 911675 that it got stuck!<br />He couldn't unhook it.
912560 914631 And about an hour later
914800 917076 Mom comes home, and she finds him there.
917240 918276 <i>Shit!</i>
918440 919920 Her little pretzel boy<br />on his bedroom floor naked.
920960 922553 Little pretzel boy?
922720 924598 Great story. Are we back on now?
924760 926035 So?
926360 927350 "So" what?
927520 928636 Did you suck it?
929000 930275 Let's go. Come on. Brooks.
930440 931760 Back to it. Come on. Play the game.
932600 934398 Poor man's Johnny Depp,<br />starred in <i>Jericho.</i>
934560 935914 Skeet Ulrich.
936440 938830 UN Secretary General '92 to '96.
939040 940076 Oh, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
940520 943319 This guy. He hated kids<br />in <i>Jurassic Park.</i>
943480 944470 Uh, Sam Neill.
944640 946393 Dubstep DJ, looks like Corey Feldman.
946480 947470 - Skrillex.<br />- Yep.
947560 949631 - Rappers love this Cubist painter.<br />- Picasso!
949840 952116 - Big cat shot by asshole dentist.<br /><i>- Cecil the lion!</i>
952280 953634 Time!
953720 954790 - How many?<br /><i>- Seven!</i>
954880 955916 Seven!
958440 959669 You're up, pretzel boy.
959840 960830 Whoo! Go, Max!
961080 962992 - Come on, Max.<br />- All right. Here we go.
963160 964958 And kick it. Go!
966720 967710 Oh, this is easy!
967800 971350 Annie, the famous actor that we met<br />at the airport about eight years ago.
972760 973750 Who?
973920 975752 Only actor we've ever met<br />at an airport who's famous.
976440 977556 Bobby Flay?
977720 980679 Not an actor. This fellow was<br />in front of us at the Sbarro.
980840 983116 We were wondering why he<br />wasn't in the first-class lounge.
983280 984839 Oh, yes, yes.
985360 986350 Who was that?
986520 987556 God damn it!
987640 989040 Max, there's a whole room of people<br />to help you out here.
989200 990270 - Use us.<br />- Good point.
990800 992393 He was the Incredible Hulk.
992560 993596 Eric Bana.
993800 995712 - Other one.<br /><i>- Um, Mark Ruffalo.</i>
995880 997200 - Other one.<br /><i>- Lou Ferrigno.</i>
997360 999352 Holy shit! <i>Primal Fear.</i>
999560 1001279 Richard Gere never played<br />the Incredible Hulk.
1001440 1003352 - Time.<br />- Motherfucking Ed Norton!
1003480 1004630 Oh!
1004720 1005756 <i>Primal Fear!</i>
1005920 1007070 Oh, my God!
1007240 1008230 <i>He was the Hulk.</i>
1008360 1009919 <i>- The Hulk.<br />- I forgot that.</i>
1010000 1011798 Max. Zero points.
1011960 1014794 I'd say he blew it,<br />but he won't tell us, will he?
1017440 1019193 <i>Shit! Did you?</i>
1019360 1021397 I can't believe I didn't get Bob Barker.
1021560 1024632 Hey, guys! What do you say<br />we do this at my house next week?
1025040 1026110 - House? What house?<br />- Ooh. Really?
1026280 1028749 Since I don't know how long<br />I'm gonna be here, I rented a place.
1028960 1030360 It's only a couple miles away.
1030520 1031874 You know, it's up on Broadmoor.
1032040 1033474 Oh! Swanky neighborhood.
1033640 1036200 It's a very cool house,<br />but it's just me there alone.
1036360 1038272 It'd be great<br />to have you guys come over.
1038440 1042070 Oh, well, it's kind of a tradition<br />to have game nights here.
1042240 1043435 But you know what?
1043640 1045552 Let's let him show off<br />his big house, huh?
1045720 1046995 That's the spirit!
1047160 1048435 Trust me.
1049840 1053390 This will be a game night to remember.
1054080 1055275 - Oh, boy.<br />- Mmm.
1055360 1056396 Promise?
1056480 1058392 Good night, everybody.<br />I love you much. Drive safely.
1058560 1059676 - Kisses!<br />- All right.
1059840 1061399 <i>- Take it easy.<br />- Bye.</i>
1061560 1064200 That little motherfucker.
1064560 1065676 Whoa!
1065760 1067956 Well, I mean, come on.
1068120 1070112 We don't see him in over a year.
1070280 1072840 He shows up in your dream car,
1073000 1075879 insults our house, and then tells<br />an embarrassing story about you
1076040 1078157 right before your turn<br />just to throw you off your game.
1078320 1081040 Welcome to my whole life. Why are you<br />suddenly so worked up about it?
1081200 1082919 Well, cause now<br />he's messing with your balls
1083080 1085037 and literally killing<br />millions of our babies.
1085200 1086839 Well, that's a little dramatic,
1087000 1088957 but, yeah, you know,<br />I mean, that's Brooks.
1089120 1091157 I thought that this<br />was just regular old brother stuff,
1091360 1092510 - but I totally see it now.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1092680 1094592 He undermines you every chance he gets.
1094680 1095796 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1095880 1097758 - It's crazy!<br />- Thank you, Annie.
1097920 1100037 You know, I've never won<br />a single game against him.
1100240 1101230 I just...
1101320 1103915 I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.
1105200 1106395 - Fix it?<br />- Yeah.
1106560 1107550 What are you suggesting?
1107720 1109791 I'm suggesting we beat his ass.
1110000 1111798 Jesus Christ.
1113200 1114953 Good evening.
1115120 1117032 We're gonna skip the cleanup?
1122440 1124159 Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?
1124320 1126039 No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.
1126200 1127350 - I'm gonna stay alert and ready.<br />- Evening!
1127560 1128710 Jesus, Gary!
1129760 1130910 Where are you headed?
1131080 1133720 We are going to, uh, to my brother's.
1134080 1136197 Another game night?
1136400 1138710 No. No, absolutely not.
1138880 1140473 We're going to, um,
1141400 1142436 have some dinner.
1142600 1143636 Eat.
1143760 1145194 I see.
1145520 1149230 Pity. I was going to invite you<br />over for a dinner I'm hosting.
1150080 1152914 I've purchased four lamb shanks
1153080 1157916 that I've been simmering<br />in a broth of red wine and rosemary.
1158280 1159953 That sounds so yummy, though.
1160040 1161030 Damn it.
1161120 1163316 It was actually Debbie's recipe.
1164800 1170637 I like to think she left behind her<br />recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,
1172560 1176031 but it was most likely<br />an unintentional oversight.
1181360 1184239 Well, here we go.
1185600 1186875 What?
1187960 1189155 I'm sorry?
1190240 1192038 I thought you said something.
1192320 1194118 - No.<br />- Nope, not us.
1194560 1195596 Okay.
1198520 1200159 Have fun.
1203680 1205239 Oh, fuck me.
1206160 1207958 A guy who rents a house this big
1208120 1211238 must be making up for something<br />pretty small, I'd say.
1211400 1213790 No, no. No, I've seen his dick.<br />It's pretty great.
1213960 1215758 Well, I tried.
1217200 1218475 - Hey!<br />- Hey!
1218640 1219756 - Hey!<br />- How are you doing, beautiful?
1219920 1222355 - Good, good. Really fancy.<br />- Very nice house, Tony Stark.
1222520 1224398 Should we give<br />our drink orders to Jarvis?
1225040 1227794 No, I got the Tony Stark part,<br />but then you went full nerd on me.
1227960 1229474 I kind of lost you,<br />but please do come in.
1229560 1230550 All right.
1230640 1231710 - Thanks, Cap.<br />- Hi, guys!
1231800 1232790 <i>What's up?</i>
1232880 1236351 Boy, could sleep four<br />on that couch. Look at that.
1236440 1238159 Oh, hello, friends.
1238320 1241836 Hey, let me introduce you to my date.<br />This is Sarah.
1242000 1243992 Sarah is head of company accounting<br />at our office.
1244160 1245310 Well, corporate communications.
1245480 1248393 And she's also British,<br />which means she's smart as shit.
1248600 1250273 - I'm Irish.<br />- Okay? Same island.
1250440 1251556 Well, it's really not.
1251640 1252710 <i>- Nice to meet you. Hi.</i><br />- Nice to meet you, too.
1252800 1253916 - I'm Max.<br />- Annie.
1254000 1256993 So, you can't always judge a book<br />by its past covers, can you?
1257160 1259197 - Mmm.<br />- Almost a saying.
1259400 1260470 - Here you go.<br />- Hey, Brooks.
1260640 1262074 - Cheers.<br />- We didn't know if you had any games,
1262160 1264391 so we thought we'd bring you<br />a few of our favorites.
1264560 1266074 Hey, look at that.
1266520 1268113 Whoa!
1268200 1269429 - Huh.<br /><i>- The poor games.</i>
1269600 1271512 I told you we're taking it up a notch.
1271680 1274639 The game that we're<br />gonna play tonight is so epic
1274800 1277156 that we don't need a board,<br />and we do not need pieces.
1277320 1278879 Still didn't need to throw them<br />across the room.
1279040 1280269 I was being theatrical.
1280440 1282193 Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?
1282360 1283396 A what?
1283480 1285358 It's when rich people<br />pay poor people to fight each other...
1285520 1287876 Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.<br />Stop with the fight club, okay?
1288040 1289315 - It's nonsense.<br />- No.
1289480 1290880 Ryan believes everything he reads.
1291040 1292554 Thank you.
1292720 1294996 So, what are we playing?
1297520 1302151 In the next hour, someone in this room<br />is going to be taken.
1302360 1305319 And it's gonna be up to you to find them<br />before they are murdered.
1305480 1307437 Oh! It's a murder mystery party.
1307600 1309353 <i>Notjust any murder mystery.</i>
1309520 1310954 I found this company.<br />They do it super real.
1311080 1312150 They use legit actors.
1312240 1315312 You're not gonna know<br />what's real and what's fake.
1315480 1317676 - Fun!<br /><i>- But that's not all</i>
1317840 1321993 because whoever finds the victim<br />wins the grand prize.
1323800 1325393 The keys to the Stingray.
1325560 1327153 - What?<br />- Wow.
1327320 1328959 Just the keys?
1329640 1331074 No, Ryan, the whole car.
1331240 1333357 Oh, yes! Oh, man!
1333560 1335040 You're so lucky I brought you<br />to this game night
1335200 1337271 - and not one of Max and Annie's.<br />- Hey!
1337480 1340040 - No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.<br />- Oh.
1340240 1342516 You're not gonna actually<br />give away your car?
1342680 1344114 Oh, it's just a tax write-off.
1344320 1346630 And the Audi, it's more practical.
1347080 1348514 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
1348680 1350751 Okay. How do we start?
1350920 1352673 We just wait for it to begin.
1352840 1355355 Maybe play a drinking game<br />to pass the time?
1355520 1357477 This group does not play drinking games.
1357640 1359677 Tonight we do, Max.
1360600 1362000 - Oh! "Never Have I Ever."<br />- Good one!
1362160 1363435 Can you believe this guy?
1363600 1365512 Yeah, he's ridiculous.
1365680 1367160 Beautiful house, though.
1367320 1368913 Good champagne.
1372920 1374673 Here we go.
1376080 1378356 Yup. We're at the house.
1378800 1381235 We'll let you know when we have him.
1396880 1398712 Jesus Christ!
1398880 1400599 What's with that knife?
1400800 1402393 It's for the cheese.
1402560 1405120 Okay, all right. Just, you know,
1405280 1407590 really aggressive way to carry a knife.
1408440 1409430 Oh, no, I've got one.
1409600 1413116 Never have I ever<br />connected my work computer
1413280 1416671 to the projector in the conference room<br />when it was open on a WebMD page
1416840 1417910 <i>for chlamydia symptoms.</i>
1418080 1419116 <i>That's not cool!</i>
1419280 1420396 Drink!
1420560 1422438 Just for the record,<br />I did not have chlamydia.
1422600 1425434 It was pubic dermatitis. You get it<br />from not washing your crotch, so...
1425600 1426590 <i>- Okay.<br />- Good for you.</i>
1426800 1428871 I... I like her.
1429280 1431112 And, listen, you're not supposed<br />to single people out in this game.
1431320 1433471 It's supposed to be generic things, like
1433640 1435393 "Never have I ever slept<br />with a celebrity."
1435560 1437392 Oh, I didn't know. Okay.
1437480 1438596 Whoops.
1438680 1439750 - Mmm?<br />- Ooh.
1442960 1443996 What?
1444080 1445878 You slept with a celebrity?
1446040 1448635 No, I was taking a drink<br />separate from the game.
1448720 1449790 <i>- That was bad timing.</i><br />- Mmm.
1449880 1451439 <i>I see how you would think, but it's not.</i>
1451600 1454115 Well, then why are you breathing<br />like you just got off the elliptical?
1454800 1456473 I'm not. I'm...
1456920 1459196 Come on, babe.<br />Whose turn is it?
1459320 1461630 Uh, it's Max. Max, it's your turn. Huh?
1461800 1463678 I'm not playing a drinking game.<br />Who was it?
1463840 1464830 What's the deal with that?
1464920 1465956 They've been together<br />since middle school.
1466120 1467110 <i>It's somebody else's turn.</i>
1467200 1468190 - Oh. Oh!<br />- Yeah!
1468320 1470152 How could you possibly<br />have had sex with a celebrity
1470360 1472238 when we've only had sex with each other?
1472400 1474517 Please, can you not make this<br />one of your things right now?
1474680 1475796 How is this one of my things?
1476640 1479519 Yeah, Brooks, this is why<br />we don't play drinking games.
1482640 1484393 It looks like the game is afoot.
1484480 1485755 Oh!
1485880 1487360 Thank you, God!
1487520 1489477 <i>Oh, boy. Let's buckle up, huh?</i>
1491680 1493194 Brooks Davis?
1493480 1494516 Yes.
1494600 1496193 - Oh, shit.<br />- Ooh!
1496360 1497794 This is good.
1498480 1500312 Agent Henderson.
1501120 1502156 FBI.
1502320 1505040 Sunglasses at night. It's legit.
1505200 1506270 Sit down, please.
1507520 1509034 I'll get right to the point.
1509200 1513956 The Bureau has been tracking a ring<br />of violent kidnappers
1514120 1516237 in this very neighborhood.
1516960 1520317 And we have reason to believe<br />that one of you
1521600 1523114 may be their next victim.
1525120 1526190 <i>That's terrible news.</i>
1526360 1529637 Contained within these dossiers
1529840 1533436 are the clues you will require<br />to find the kidnappers.
1533600 1535557 You'd like for us to do that, yeah?
1536120 1537952 The Bureau's...<br />What's the Bureau's role in this?
1538120 1539873 Maybe you guys could take my wife<br />in for questioning
1540040 1541713 because, apparently, she got a<br />secret life I don't know nothing about.
1541800 1544076 - Baby, this is...<br />- Shut up, all of you!
1544160 1545310 Wow.
1546880 1548599 It's not a joke.
1548760 1551480 You people are in real danger,<br />and you're running out of time.
1551640 1555395 And I, Agent Henderson,<br />will not stand idly by
1555560 1559679 while innocent civilians<br />are slaughtered on my watch.
1559840 1560910 I told you<br />this is gonna be great.
1561120 1562952 - It's so good!<br />- So good.
1563160 1564150 But, uh, before we get started,
1564320 1566391 I'm required to ask if any of you<br />have any food allergies.
1567040 1568076 Peanuts?
1569080 1570230 Who the hell are you?
1570320 1571390 Oh!
1571480 1573073 Now wait a second.<br />I know you're method and all,
1573240 1575436 but you can't just come in here<br />and break the door.
1575560 1577597 I do not mind this game.
1577800 1579359 Are you crazy?
1594360 1596113 It's very well done.
1597400 1598550 No!
1599240 1600833 That is a strong table.
1602000 1603434 Oh, watch out! He's packing heat!
1603600 1604636 Hell no!
1610160 1612117 Oh! Oh!
1635680 1636716 Come on!
1649960 1652475 You're just making this<br />harder on yourself!
1655560 1656550 Oh, shit!
1657480 1659915 Guys, make sure you<br />get a piece of this cheese. It's just...
1660080 1662390 - Cut me one.<br />- Try it with the quince.
1670120 1671520 <i>Oh, my God!</i>
1672120 1673156 Now he's back.
1673240 1674435 Stop fighting, asshole!
1674600 1675716 Help me! This isn't...
1675800 1678156 The Independent Spirit Award goes to...
1678400 1679550 Let's go!
1680360 1681350 Bye-bye!
1681520 1683079 First one that follows us gets shot!
1683280 1684919 Okay, roger that. You drive safe.
1685120 1686713 Come on, motherfucker!
1687120 1689271 - That was amazing.<br />- Really good.
1689440 1690760 - That was really good.<br />- Wow.
1691040 1695034 Mmm. No, there's something about this<br />that just doesn't feel right.
1695560 1697836 How could you cheat on me<br />with a celebrity?
1698000 1699036 I didn't cheat on you.
1699200 1701715 It was before we got married<br />when we took that break.
1701880 1704111 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1704280 1705270 <i>I've been living in The Matrix.</i>
1705440 1708433 Agent Henderson,<br />you just gonna keep lying there?
1708640 1709630 Is any of this real?
1709800 1711393 Well, don't kick him!
1712000 1713992 - Stop.<br />- He's a regular Daniel Day-Lewis.
1714160 1715196 <i>I thought we both agreed</i>
1715280 1718159 <i>that we wouldn't hook up<br />with anybody else during that break.</i>
1718360 1720670 Yeah, but then you went<br />and got a hand job from Karen Waller.
1720840 1722513 <i>- No, don't do that.</i><br />- Boop! Boop! Boop!
1722680 1724558 Because it was over the pants,<br />all right?
1724720 1728077 It was, and it hurt. It was very dry,<br />and I didn't climax.
1728240 1729754 Just admit it.<br />You guys did more than that.
1729920 1731832 Don't turn this around on me.<br />Do not do that.
1732040 1733190 Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!
1733520 1734510 Damn it, they got the jump on us.
1734600 1735590 - Come on.<br />- Shit, Kev!
1735680 1736670 Come on now!
1736760 1738513 All right. Here's the first clue.<br />Looks like a riddle.
1738600 1740080 "With shiny fangs..."
1740240 1741879 "My bloodless bite..."
1742040 1744839 "Will bring together<br />what's mostly white."
1745000 1746798 Donald Trump.
1746960 1750749 "Bloodless bite." It's not a vampire.<br />Um...
1750920 1752240 I'll just Google it.
1752400 1753595 It's so inconsistent, isn't it?
1753680 1755433 I mean, they stage<br />this super realistic fight.
1755600 1758434 They give us an FBI dossier<br />but with riddles.
1758600 1760398 It's like, let's pick a tone.<br />Let's stick with it.
1760560 1762313 But that's the game.<br />You wanna win this car or not?
1762480 1763880 Yeah, yeah. More than anything,
1764040 1765554 but I feel like Brooks is setting me up.
1765720 1767040 Do you get that feeling? You know,
1767240 1770711 that this is some game<br />where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?
1772480 1773914 Mmm-hmm.
1774800 1776951 Well, let's not play by his rules.
1778360 1779874 "My bloodless bite, my bloodless,<br />bloodless bite.
1780040 1781997 "Bloodless bite, bloodless bite,<br />bloodless bite."
1782160 1784391 Can you stop chanting "bloodless bite"?<br />It's just...
1784960 1786952 - Trying to think.<br />- Yeah.
1787480 1789995 Oh, shit!
1790520 1792671 <i>Max and Annie must have figured it out.</i>
1792840 1795036 Right. We need to find an advantage.
1795400 1798837 Advantage, advantage, advantage...
1799120 1800110 Brooks' wallet?
1800280 1802431 You think we should steal<br />all of his shit!
1803000 1803990 No.
1808480 1810472 Hi, yeah. I lost my credit card.
1810560 1812358 I was wondering if you could tell me<br />what the last few charges I made were.
1812520 1813590 What are you doing?
1813760 1815353 If we can find out the name<br />of the murder mystery place he used,
1815520 1817591 we can go to their office and<br />pay them off to give us the final clue.
1817760 1819160 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1819320 1823439 You're, like, a double threat.<br />Brains and you're British.
1824440 1825590 Thanks.
1825800 1831194 Okay. What has shiny fangs<br />that bites white things together?
1831360 1832350 A stapler!
1832520 1834512 And the white things are paper.
1834680 1837593 Yes! You are so smart and unfaithful!
1837840 1838876 Oh, there it is.
1839040 1840156 Yes!
1841280 1842999 Look at that.
1843160 1844958 - Flash drive.<br />- Put it in the desktop.
1847280 1848270 Okay.
1849120 1850190 Another riddle.
1850360 1853558 "I'm brown and old by day,<br />white and young by night.
1853720 1854710 "My eyes are glass.
1854880 1856758 "I have nine faces but no head.
1856920 1858639 "I sing to the sky but have no voice.
1858800 1861395 "I'm everywhere and nowhere."
1863120 1864998 What the fuck is that?
1866360 1867680 I mean, how cool are we?
1867880 1869200 - Very, very cool. We are very cool.<br />- Right?
1869360 1872717 You're the cool one. You know,<br />tracking the phone is just a great idea.
1872880 1874155 Still on Route 18, huh?
1874320 1876312 <i>We're catching up to them.<br />Here we come, Brooksie.</i>
1876520 1879194 Can you imagine the look on his face<br />when we find him so fast?
1879360 1882751 You know, baby, I can feel my sperm<br />already coming back to life.
1882920 1884070 - Perfect.<br /><i>- Yeah.</i>
1884240 1887392 So we'll win your brother's car,<br />and then we'll go make a baby in it.
1887560 1889472 - Yeah! We'll make him watch us. Huh?<br />- Yeah.
1890440 1892352 - I don't wanna do that.<br />- No, me neither.
1892520 1893749 - Sorry, don't know why I said that.<br />- I'm not into that.
1893920 1895479 - Not a great idea.<br />- Okay.
1895640 1896869 Okay, great. Thank you.
1897080 1898309 All right, I got the name<br />and the address of the games company.
1898480 1899675 - Let's go.<br />- Yes!
1899840 1902753 All we have to do now,<br />figure out what "bloodless bite" means.
1903320 1904549 No, we don't. That's why...
1906040 1908475 - Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.<br />- Doesn't matter. Let's go.
1908640 1910199 How you gonna be old and young?
1910360 1912113 - That doesn't make sense.<br />- I know.
1912280 1914795 Guys, hey, how's it goin'?
1914960 1918078 I just wanted to wish you<br />the best of luck tonight. Bye.
1921040 1922235 - No.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1922440 1923760 What are... What are you doing?
1923920 1925354 Just being a dick.
1925480 1927711 <i>Oh!</i>
1927800 1929757 - Don't kick him, Ryan!<br />- He's such a good actor!
1929920 1930956 <i>Ryan!</i>
1931040 1933430 <i>God damn it!</i>
1934560 1936950 Baby, hand me those matches.<br />I'm about to burn this door down.
1937160 1939550 You're gonna light a fire in<br />a windowless room that we're trapped in?
1939720 1942189 You slept with Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br />He talked to you about flames?
1942360 1943430 What about that?
1957840 1959638 Where could he be?
1960040 1962509 His phone stopped right here, huh?
1964960 1966189 - Hear that?<br />- Yeah.
1968080 1969150 Ugh.
1969400 1970470 Found it!
1970640 1972074 He must've known we were tracking him.
1972280 1973794 Well, they outsmarted us.
1975800 1976790 Hang on.
1978720 1980359 Isn't that one of the actors?
1980760 1982831 <i>Guess they're not<br />so smart after all, huh?</i>
1983040 1985919 Guess not. We are nailing this!
1987120 1988156 Why are we crouching?
1988320 1990516 I don't know. It feels right.
1994280 1995953 Oh, it's horrible in here.
1996120 1998840 - Yeah, it's sticky. Shoes are shot.<br />- Ugh.
1999480 2001233 Ooh. There he is. There he is.<br />Don't let him see you. Come on.
2001400 2002720 Sit down right here.
2002880 2005156 Bartender, sir,<br />can I ask you a question?
2005240 2006310 Um...
2006560 2007676 You, um...
2007760 2009956 You didn't happen to see a fellow<br />brought in here,
2010120 2011349 looks a little bit like me,
2011520 2013751 but he's got a little bit<br />of a sharper chin
2013920 2015195 and higher cheekbones?
2015360 2017033 So a better-looking guy?
2017400 2019232 No, well, I wouldn't call it that.
2019480 2020960 I didn't see nothing.
2022440 2024159 - Oh, boy. You hear that?<br />- Huh. Yeah.
2024320 2025549 That double negative?<br />"Didn't see nothing"?
2025720 2027359 - It's a little forced, right?<br />- Yeah, I think he's in on it.
2027520 2028749 - 'Course he is.<br />- Look at those tats.
2028960 2030679 So fresh, probably fake.
2031240 2033436 Tell you what.<br />Let's give him a test, okay?
2033600 2036320 Let's order a couple of drinks that only<br />a real bartender would know how to make.
2036400 2037436 Oh, smart! Yes.
2037520 2038954 - Sir! Excuse me. Hi.<br />- Barkeep.
2039120 2040474 Totally forgot to order drinks.
2040680 2041796 Yes, uh...
2042400 2045199 Could I please have a vodka tonic?
2047000 2048036 Well done, honey.
2048200 2050476 I'm gonna have a Harvey Wallbanger.
2050640 2052597 Okay? Appreciate it.
2053200 2054759 Jesus! Did you see that look?
2054920 2055956 Guy doesn't know what's going on.
2056120 2057190 Think you stumped him.
2057360 2059238 Regional theater hack.
2059320 2060720 Huh?
2061200 2063635 - Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?<br />- Yeah.
2063800 2064790 It's nice to get out of the house.
2065000 2067231 You know, we're not gonna be able<br />to do stuff like this if we have kids.
2067880 2068950 - What?<br />- Yeah.
2069040 2070235 - Why not?<br />- Well, I don't know.
2070400 2071880 I was thinking about it.<br />Remember Dan and Linda?
2072040 2073997 Remember how much time<br />we used to spend with them?
2074160 2076959 Just tons of fun.<br />And then they had those twins.
2077120 2078474 Boom! Off the grid, right?
2078680 2080751 Last time we saw them<br />was their Christmas card
2080840 2081830 with the wonky kids on it.
2082000 2084799 Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.<br />They look so happy.
2084880 2086075 But you know what I mean.
2087120 2088759 - We don't see them...<br />- Vodka tonic.
2089240 2090720 Harvey Wallbanger.
2090880 2091996 - Appreciate it.<br />- Thank you.
2092160 2093640 Cheers.
2096520 2097590 Did he get it right?
2097920 2099957 Huh. I do not know. I realized I've<br />never had one of these,
2100160 2102391 but that is a tasty drink.<br />It's kind of tart.
2102560 2104392 <i>You wanna try it? Oh! Honey!</i>
2104560 2105755 Honey! There's Brooks!
2105920 2108389 Brooks is here. Brooks is here.<br />We're about to win this thing!
2108560 2110711 - Yes, yes!<br />- Look who came in here.
2110920 2113230 Oh! No! I think he made us.
2113400 2114993 So what? It's over.<br />What, are they gonna try to stop us?
2115160 2116480 - Let's go.<br />- Yeah, probably.
2116640 2119519 But that's why I brought this.
2119720 2121200 Jesus Christ, honey!<br />Where did you get a gun?
2121360 2123591 No, no, that's the fake gun<br />from Brooks' fight.
2123760 2126116 - Oh, yeah. Boy, that looks real.<br />- Yeah, well, you know...
2126200 2127600 - Brooks never spares any expense.<br />- Look at that.
2127760 2130150 - Yeah, that's true.<br />- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?
2130320 2131356 Why? What are you doing?
2131480 2132470 Lead?
2132560 2134677 Any of you fucking pricks move,
2134840 2138436 and I'll execute every motherfucking<br />last one of you!
2138520 2139636 Very nice, honey.
2139720 2141552 <i>Pulp Fiction,</i> anybody?<br />Right? It's a classic.
2141640 2142869 We love films.
2142960 2144758 Okay, what the fuck is this shit?
2144840 2146911 Well, you're gonna hand over the keys<br />'cause we're gonna take my brother.
2147040 2148076 Bullshit.
2148160 2151312 Oh! You know what's bullshit<br />is your bald, ugly face.
2151400 2153790 Uh-uh. No, that's personal.<br />Come on, honey, let's just keep it fun.
2153920 2156196 All right, I'm sorry I called you bald,<br />you little bitch!
2156280 2157839 Well, that's, again, you know...
2157920 2160151 - Let the gun do the talking. Come on.<br />- Okay. Ah!
2160280 2161999 On your knees. Hands in the air.
2162160 2163640 - Good. Good. Great.<br />- Heads on the ground. Eyes closed.
2163800 2165200 That's it. Get them up, reach for it.
2165360 2166953 - Hands up! That's right.<br />- There we go.
2167120 2168873 - All right, hands in the air!<br />- Get them up!
2169040 2170394 - Yep.<br />- Yo, where's my head go?
2170600 2171829 - Down.<br />- On the floor.
2172000 2173116 Just rest it.
2173200 2174429 How am I supposed<br />to put my hands in the air
2174520 2175795 - with my head on the ground?<br />- Fucking exactly.
2175880 2177519 I did have the same question.
2178880 2181440 Child's pose?<br />Do you guys know child's pose?
2181600 2182636 Fuck is a child's pose, man?
2182800 2183790 <i>You've never done yoga?</i>
2183880 2184916 - Okay, wow.<br />- No?
2186320 2187390 - Cover me.<br />- Show them, baby.
2187560 2189233 <i>- All right. Arms out.</i><br />- Here she comes.
2189400 2191119 Knees apart if you have back problems.
2191200 2192350 And if you're doing it right,
2192440 2195353 you're really gonna feel that<br />lumbar opening up back there.
2195440 2196476 Let's put your head down.
2196560 2199439 Come on. I don't wanna have to use this.<br />Okay?
2199680 2201114 Okay.
2201720 2203154 Can't you just tell me who it was?
2203240 2206278 I know you, Kev. If I tell you,<br />you'll just obsess about it even more.
2206360 2207874 Okay, fine. How about this?
2207960 2209872 If I guess it right, you tell me.
2209960 2211030 Fine.
2211120 2212110 Was it an actor?
2212280 2213430 Yes. That tower is unstable.
2213600 2215637 I'm not stable! Was he over 40?
2215800 2216790 Yes. Be careful.
2216960 2219077 Okay. American?
2219240 2220356 Yes.
2222280 2223999 It's Tommy Lee Jones.
2224480 2225880 What? Ew. No.
2227560 2230120 Denzel? Was it Denzel?<br />Denzel Washington?
2230280 2232476 It wasn't, unfortunately.
2232640 2233835 Thank God.
2235320 2236595 <i>Um... Be careful.</i>
2236760 2238399 Oh! Sweet freedom.
2238480 2240119 Oh, my God!
2240200 2242510 You see, this dumbass thought<br />he can keep us locked in here.
2242680 2245479 But guess what?<br />You can't lock us in here!
2245680 2247717 You see, hate put us in here!
2247880 2250190 - Okay, baby.<br />- But love is gonna bust us out!
2250360 2251794 - Ahh!<br />- Oh, my God!
2254080 2255116 Oh, my God!
2255280 2256714 Kev! Kev, are you okay?
2256880 2258473 Baby, I fell down.
2266880 2268280 There it is.
2268920 2272436 Yes, I'm so glad I invited you tonight!
2272520 2273670 Yeah, me, too.
2273840 2277072 I usually bring these girls<br />I wanna sleep with, and they just suck!
2277240 2279675 You're like a breath of fresh air.
2279760 2281274 Aw, thanks.
2281440 2283796 I usually go out with men<br />I find interesting and non-stupid,
2283880 2285394 so this is a bit new for me, too.
2285480 2286675 Whoa!
2286920 2287910 Are we cool?
2288120 2289634 Did I say something wrong?
2289800 2290790 No.
2290880 2293395 No, I mean I was wondering why you<br />asked me along tonight,
2293600 2295910 and now I know you<br />just needed a ringer, so...
2296280 2298954 Oh, did you... You thought<br />this was a date? I didn't...
2299160 2302392 No, actually.<br />Well, I was hoping it wasn't.
2302840 2304559 Then why are you wearing lipstick?
2304720 2305915 - I'm not.<br />- Yeah, you are.
2306080 2307275 What are you...
2307440 2308760 You can't touch a girl's mouth.
2308920 2310593 Why? Are you scared I'm<br />gonna smear your lipstick...
2310760 2312433 Oh, my God! You bit me!
2312600 2313636 Yeah, and I'll bite you again.
2313720 2314756 There's lipstick on here.
2314920 2316434 Oh, shut up!
2316600 2318478 I see you wiping off that date lipstick!
2320440 2321590 Ow!
2321680 2323717 That really hurt a little bit.
2325000 2326320 Hello?
2326560 2328119 Hello?
2335720 2336949 Um, excuse me?
2341880 2343394 Yeah, okay.
2344200 2345270 Um...
2345360 2346350 Hello?
2350200 2352192 Oh, oh! Oh, shit!
2354880 2355950 Holy shit!
2356880 2357996 God!
2358440 2359954 Come on! Bloody hell!
2360120 2361270 - What?<br />- Phew!
2361600 2364559 You guys scared me so bad.<br />What are you doing?
2364720 2365949 What the fuck is that?
2366760 2368479 Oh. Well, I just came from
2368560 2370517 a six-hour murder mystery<br />where I played the corpse.
2370600 2373160 I must've dozed off<br />before I had a chance to clean up.
2373240 2375391 Well, you scared the shit out of us.
2375480 2376596 Really? Thank you.
2376680 2378672 Actually that means a lot<br />'cause I do my own makeup.
2378840 2381196 What kind of party<br />has a pregnant corpse?
2381360 2384478 No, I'm actually pregnant.<br />This isn't part of it. This is just...
2384560 2385596 Oh!
2385680 2386750 - Congrats.<br /><i>- Thank you!</i>
2388320 2390710 Um, we want you<br />to give us the final clue
2390800 2393838 to the murder mystery<br />Brooks Davis ordered.
2393920 2395832 Oh, my gosh.<br />But that would ruin the fun.
2395920 2398594 We don't want the fun.<br />We just wanna win.
2398680 2400353 Yeah, I can't do that.
2411880 2413917 This change your mind?
2418800 2419950 No.
2421360 2422714 Don't...
2423120 2425271 What about this?
2433440 2434715 Mmm.
2435800 2437234 You drive a hard bargain. Okay.
2437400 2439710 Let's take it up a notch.
2453000 2456676 I was hoping I wasn't<br />gonna have to dig this deep, but okay.
2456840 2458911 Final offer.
2465680 2469117 You know what? It doesn't matter<br />how slowly you slide it over!
2469320 2471551 Okay? It's $17! How much do you want?
2472400 2474596 - Um, I don't know. Probably $100.<br />- Give her $100.
2475000 2476514 I don't have a hundred.
2477400 2479357 How much have you got?
2480000 2481116 $17.
2481360 2483158 $17?
2484280 2485794 <i>You brought $17 out?</i>
2488320 2490152 Nice!
2490520 2491636 - Thank you!<br />- Cool.
2492120 2494077 So you're just gonna keep it. I got you.
2494800 2496314 Stay back!
2496400 2498357 Hey, buddy, can you just give us<br />the answer to the second riddle,
2498440 2499669 'cause we're way behind.
2499760 2501080 Don't you get it?
2501160 2502833 That was not supposed to happen.
2504920 2507230 Oh, what now? You guys already<br />did the breaking-in thing.
2507320 2509755 Shut up! And get on the floor,<br />all of you!
2510040 2511110 Whoa!
2511200 2513192 Ron, you okay?
2513320 2515232 No, Nathan, I'm not okay.
2515320 2517960 Two guys came in here and attacked me.
2518040 2519679 - Oh, my God.<br />- I know!
2519760 2522798 And I quit Disney Cruises<br />for this bullshit.
2525080 2526514 We can check,<br />but that doesn't make any sense.
2526680 2527909 I'm not wearing a jacket.
2528080 2530470 Maybe it means, like a book jacket.
2530640 2533075 Why would a book have a jacket?
2534960 2535950 Murder We Wrote.
2536080 2537434 Glenda, something terrible has happened.
2537520 2538510 What?
2538640 2539994 <i>Nathan and I<br />showed up for the takeaway,</i>
2540080 2541799 <i>and Ron had been attacked.</i>
2541960 2543189 Where? At the Brooks Davis house?
2543360 2544396 <i>- Yes.</i><br />- Huh?
2544520 2545510 What?
2546640 2548120 Is everyone okay?
2548280 2549999 <i>No, no. I'm not okay, Glenda!</i>
2550160 2553517 I have a throbbing headache,<br />and they took the host!
2553680 2555353 - Who took him?<br /><i>- Kidnappers!</i>
2555520 2558115 Real ones! Dangerous fucking criminals!
2568600 2571513 <i>I'm packed and I'm holding<br />I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden</i>
2571680 2572830 <i>She lives for me</i>
2573000 2574275 - Sing into the mic.<br />- Jesus!
2574360 2575396 No.
2575480 2579076 <i>Her own motivation<br />She goes round, and she goes down on me</i>
2579240 2580276 And you, Tats?
2580440 2583194 You got something to say? No? Boop.
2583360 2585591 <i>Coming over you<br />Keep on smiling, what we go through</i>
2586040 2588680 <i>One stop to the rhythm that divides you</i>
2588840 2591958 I see you eyeing that, Ponytail.<br />Not on my watch!
2592040 2593918 Bingo! Bingo! I got them, baby.<br />Let's do this.
2594080 2596436 Yes! Okay.
2597880 2599394 Hey, hey, Brooks!
2599560 2601677 - Guess who it is!<br />- Oh!
2601840 2604674 Ready? Hello!
2604960 2606155 <i>- Look at that face!</i><br />- Oh, shit.
2606320 2607356 That is priceless!
2607440 2608840 You did not expect us this early,<br />did you?
2609040 2611271 I've gotta capture this moment.<br />Honey, get in there.
2611440 2613272 We'll take a quick little selfie here
2613440 2615830 and send it off to the losers.<br />One, two, three.
2616000 2617275 Cheese!
2617360 2618555 Ha!
2618640 2619630 Perfect. Oh, speak of the devil.
2619760 2621877 There's Ryan now,<br />probably calling begging for help.
2621960 2622950 - Ugh!<br />- Ignore.
2623040 2624599 This is not a game, Max!
2625280 2628193 Jesus! Guys, it's a wrap in here, okay?
2628600 2629590 <i>Show's over!</i>
2629680 2631512 Listen, I'm not a venture capitalist.<br />I'm a smuggler!
2631680 2634479 - A smuggler?<br />- Yeah, I made a mistake.
2634560 2635710 I sold the Bulgarian's egg<br />to a different guy.
2635800 2637439 And I have to get it back to him,<br />or he's gonna kill me!
2637600 2640399 "The Bulgarian's egg"? Wasn't that<br />the third <i>Harry Potter</i> book? Come on.
2640560 2642950 Wait, I'm confused. So, this isn't<br />the end of this whole thing?
2643160 2644276 No, it is the end, okay?
2644440 2646159 You said, whoever catches you<br />gets the car.
2646320 2648471 We found you, we get the car. Game over.
2648640 2650757 No! I'm telling you! This is all real!
2651120 2652474 <i>The shitty actors are real?<br />Come on.</i>
2652640 2654438 How about that ridiculous fight?<br />Was that real?
2654600 2656000 Is this gun real?
2656080 2657070 Oh, no, Annie!
2657160 2659436 Oh, no. Oh, no. Bang, bang.
2661600 2662590 Ow!
2670960 2671996 Blood!
2672160 2674755 Oh, my God! I shot you!
2674920 2676400 You fucking shot me!
2676560 2678153 Cut me loose before we all get shot!
2678360 2679350 Come on, untie me!
2679680 2680716 <i>- Get me out of here!</i><br />- Oh, God!
2682360 2683635 Help me. Help.
2683800 2684950 Oh, my God!
2685160 2687197 - Go out! Go, go, go!<br />- What the fuck did you do to me?
2687360 2689033 Come on, come on, come on.
2689480 2691153 - Hey!<br />- Where are the guns?
2693720 2694756 You shot me.
2694960 2696474 I know. I feel terrible.
2696640 2697915 - Come on, man!<br />- Go! Go, go!
2698000 2699036 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2699120 2700110 Come on, come on, come on!
2700200 2701520 - Oh, my God!<br /><i>- Move your ass!</i>
2701600 2703353 - Honey, get in!<br /><i>- Go, go!</i>
2703520 2704795 <i>Go, go, go!</i>
2706120 2707679 Holy shit!
2708920 2711754 Hold up! Hold up, motherfucker!
2713120 2715237 - God damn it!<br />- Man, come on!
2717280 2719317 Brooks, what the fuck<br />is going on with you? Start talking!
2719400 2721835 I've lied to you<br />and the family about what I do.
2721920 2724879 I buy and I sell illegal shit for people<br />in the black market.
2724960 2726235 Really? So you're a criminal?
2726320 2727436 Oh, my God! They're following us!
2729320 2730595 But I made a mistake,<br />because there's this guy.
2730680 2731670 They call him the Bulgarian.
2731760 2734070 He's got his fingers in all these pies<br />around the world.
2734240 2736232 - What kind of pies?<br />- Illegal pies, Max.
2736320 2739074 You know, the kind of pies that have<br />heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.
2739160 2740150 You know, all that kind of stuff.
2740240 2742994 But he just wanted me to help him<br />find this Fabergé egg.
2743080 2745436 Fuck that! Fabergé egg?
2745520 2747000 - Are you kidding me?<br />- No, I'm serious.
2747080 2748070 And I found it!
2748160 2750800 But then there was this other guy,<br />this Marlon Freeman.
2750880 2752951 He's willing to pay twice as much<br />for the same egg.
2753040 2754520 <i>So what? So you screwed over<br />the Bulgarian guy</i>
2754600 2755875 and those fellows behind us<br />work for him,
2755960 2757713 and they just happen to crash your<br />murder mystery party?
2757800 2760076 I know, right?<br />What are the odds of that?
2761560 2762789 - Oh, too close, too close!<br />- Careful, careful!
2765040 2766269 Watch out! Watch out!
2766360 2767350 Oh, oh!
2770040 2771269 - Shit!<br />- Sorry! You okay?
2771440 2772476 Yeah, I'm all right.
2772560 2774995 - We need to go to the cops now!<br />- Yeah, right now! Let's go!
2775160 2776230 - We can't go to the cops!<br />- Why?
2776400 2777675 The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.
2777840 2778956 On his face?
2780640 2781960 No, in the police department.
2782120 2783440 Look out!
2784840 2786194 <i>Careful!</i>
2790800 2792200 Oh, my God! This is insane!
2806640 2808916 If you call the cops,<br />I'll be dead before I get to jail.
2809080 2810594 Why don't we just get a hold<br />of this Marlon Freeman guy
2810680 2811750 and buy the egg back from him?
2811840 2813911 I couldn't find him if I wanted to.<br />That name's an alias.
2817960 2819553 - Gun, gun, gun! Duck!<br />- Oh, oh...
2829600 2831671 Okay, these guys are not stopping.<br />What do we do?
2831840 2834912 They're not gonna stop<br />until they get me.
2835080 2836992 I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this.
2837080 2838070 Oh, my God!
2838240 2840471 I'm sorry for a lot of things.
2842800 2843870 - Hey! What are you doing?<br />- What is he doing? What is he doing?
2845760 2847752 - I love you, Max!<br />- Brooks, don't be an idiot!
2850320 2851310 <i>Stop the car!</i>
2860080 2862515 - Shit! Go, go, go!<br />- Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
2866000 2868151 Fuck! What are we gonna do?<br />They're gonna kill my brother.
2868320 2869913 Oh, Annie, I feel faint.<br />I'm gonna pass out.
2870080 2871878 Oh, honey, we'll get you<br />to a hospital, okay?
2872040 2873315 No, no, no! No hospitals.
2873480 2874755 This is a gunshot wound,<br />they'll call the cops.
2874840 2875830 Shit, shit! Okay.
2875920 2878435 So we go to a mob doctor, right?
2879520 2880840 Do you know one of those, sweetheart?
2881000 2882719 - No.<br />- No.
2882880 2884599 What about a veterinarian<br />that works for the mob?
2885120 2886839 - You know one of those?<br />- No.
2887000 2888434 Come on. Why are you pitching<br />all the mob stuff?
2888600 2890717 - I think 'cause I'm losing my shit here!<br />- I get it.
2890880 2891916 You're gonna have to do it.
2892000 2892990 - What?<br />- Yup.
2893080 2894196 <i>You're gonna have<br />to take the bullet out.</i>
2894360 2895476 I don't wanna... I don't wanna do it.
2895640 2896710 You think I want you<br />to take the bullet out?
2896880 2899156 I've seen you try to cut a chicken.<br />We have no other option.
2899320 2901710 Oh, my God! This is so bad!
2901880 2903439 I hate game night!
2907040 2908360 Thank you!
2909960 2910950 Hey!
2911040 2912713 Oh, thank God.<br />Listen, Annie. It's all real.
2912800 2913790 <i>Oh, no, I know.</i>
2913880 2915473 Brooks is caught up in something and...
2915680 2917034 Okay, where are you guys?
2917120 2918713 We're all at Brooks'.<br />Waiting to talk to the cops.
2918800 2921031 <i>No! No, no, no! Do not talk to the cops!</i>
2921200 2922236 What? Why? What's going on?
2922440 2923669 - Are you guys okay?<br /><i>- Yeah, yeah.</i>
2923840 2925991 We're fine. We're fine.<br />I shot Max, but he's fine.
2926080 2927070 What?
2927160 2928514 <i>Look. We will meet you<br />back at our house.</i>
2928600 2930432 Whatever you do,<br />do not tell the cops anything.
2930520 2932796 Brooks's life depends on it.
2937480 2938880 - Hey.<br /><i>- Hi.</i>
2939080 2940196 Okay.
2940360 2941396 I got a bunch of stuff.
2941480 2942470 Yeah.
2943040 2945236 Pocket knife. Tweezers.
2945320 2946754 Sewing kit. Gauze.
2946880 2948314 Good, good. All right.<br />Wow, you did great!
2948480 2950915 Yeah.<br />And they didn't have rubbing alcohol.
2951080 2953879 And they don't sell hard liquor,<br />so I got you this lovely chard.
2954040 2956157 Good idea. Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.
2956320 2958198 What else did you get, huh?<br />More good stuff?
2958760 2960991 What is helpful in <i>Country Living?</i>
2961160 2964915 Oh, that's for later. There's a corn<br />chowder recipe. It looks really good.
2965080 2966912 - You love corn chowder, huh?<br />- Sweet. I do, yeah.
2967080 2968150 - That'll cheer you up.<br />- Thank you.
2968240 2969720 Okay. And then a squeaky toy.
2970240 2971276 - Huh.<br />- For your mouth.
2971440 2972430 - For the pain.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2972600 2974080 Okay. Well, hopefully I won't need this.
2974280 2976078 - Okay, let's see this bad boy.<br />- All right.
2976280 2977350 Yeah, careful.
2977520 2979159 - Okay.<br />- All right.
2980400 2981390 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
2981560 2982550 - We're gonna push past it.<br />- No problem. No problem.
2982720 2983790 - We're gonna get the bullet out.<br />- Let's just Google.
2984000 2985275 Honey, can you return the text later?
2985440 2987193 This is instructions<br />on how to remove a bullet.
2988120 2989634 - Oh, sorry.<br />- It's an alt-right militia website,
2989840 2991433 so I'm just gonna<br />ignore the racist stuff.
2991600 2992670 - Good. Good, good.<br />- Yeah?
2992880 2994314 Okay. "Step one, sterile gloves."
2994760 2995989 Check!
2996160 2997196 We're doing the best we can, right?
2997360 2999079 Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.
2999240 3000754 "Step two."
3000840 3003435 Um... Okay. "Disinfect wound."
3003640 3005597 Right, yeah.<br />That's gonna sting, isn't it?
3005680 3007080 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
3007160 3008480 - Let's do it.<br />- Okay?
3010360 3012556 That smarts, huh?
3012720 3014473 Yeah.
3014640 3016597 Gonna administer anesthetic.
3016760 3018752 - We don't have that.<br />- Just gonna skip that one. Okay.
3018920 3020513 "Step four,<br />apply pressure above the wound."
3020680 3022592 Here, you squeeze that there.
3022680 3023716 - I got it.<br />- Great. Thank you.
3023800 3026360 We're just gonna<br />make two tiny incisions...
3026440 3027954 - Oh, my God.<br />- On either side of the wound.
3028040 3030236 Easy-peasy. Huh?
3030520 3031715 This is fun, huh?
3031840 3033672 - Are you having fun?<br />- No.
3033800 3034870 Let's get the bullet.
3034960 3036314 - Okay. Here we go.<br />- Let's get in there and get it.
3036400 3038517 - Nice and small, nice and small, baby.<br />- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
3038600 3039670 Tiny, teeny.
3043440 3045750 That's not small. That's really big!
3045920 3046956 So big?
3047040 3049157 Way too big, baby.<br />It's a bullet, not a grapefruit.
3049240 3051391 I'm sorry! I'm sorry.<br />This is my first time. I don't know...
3051480 3052960 Oh, there's so much blood.
3054320 3057472 - No, no. Don't you start doing that.<br />- No, you're gonna make...
3060960 3061996 - I'm sorry.<br />- Stop it.
3062120 3063474 I'm looking at you,<br />and you're making me...
3063560 3064914 Well, don't look at me.<br />I won't look at it.
3065040 3066759 - Push through. Let's go.<br />- Okay. All right, okay.
3066840 3067830 - No more cutting.<br />- Oh, shit.
3067960 3069030 Just get the tweezers<br />and get the bullet out, baby.
3069120 3070349 Shit, shit, shit. Um...
3070440 3072557 - What? What happened?<br />- Phone went to sleep.
3072640 3073869 You gotta set it so that thing stays on.
3073960 3075110 - No. My phone doesn't do that.<br />- Sure it does.
3075200 3076520 Same phone as mine. Just change it.
3076600 3078876 Just gonna touch it with my nose<br />every 30 seconds. It's fine.
3078960 3080360 Don't be afraid of your phone.<br />Get in there, go to the settings,
3080440 3083114 go to "Display" and change the timing<br />so that it doesn't revert to sleep mode.
3083200 3084236 - Revert?<br />- Yeah.
3084320 3085913 What are you, Steve Jobs?<br />I'm not reverting anything. No.
3086000 3087036 No, I'm just<br />unafraid of my phone, honey.
3087120 3088110 It's so fucking simple.
3088600 3090319 Shh! Quiet. I know what I'm doing, okay?
3090520 3091715 Do you?
3091800 3092790 Yes.
3093000 3094753 - Here we go. Here we go.<br /><i>- Here she goes.</i>
3094920 3096400 <i>You're like a dolphin.</i>
3096560 3098279 All right. This part's gonna hurt.
3098440 3099590 I don't... I don't doubt it.
3099760 3101160 Okay, let's do this.
3101600 3102590 Okay.
3103760 3104955 Ooh... Oh, wait.
3105520 3106510 What is that?
3106880 3107870 You hear that?
3108000 3109514 What's that sound? What's that sound?
3109600 3110829 Is that the bullet?
3111000 3113276 - That's bone!<br />- What?
3113360 3114919 That's not right.
3115360 3119195 Okay. Um, what do the racists say<br />if you can't find the bullet?
3119280 3120600 Yeah, that's bone. You got the bone.
3120720 3122712 I'm looking at my bone. Look right here.
3122880 3125952 Max, did you get shot twice?
3129160 3130276 That's the exit wound.
3130800 3132314 Oh, it came out!
3132440 3133920 Yup. Nothing to remove.
3134080 3135275 The bullet has exited the arm.
3135400 3136595 Well, let's just sew<br />that sucker up, huh?
3136680 3137670 Yeah.
3139960 3142600 No, no. Honey, don't, don't look at...
3142680 3143716 Stop it.
3146120 3147190 <i>I'm sorry.</i>
3147520 3149989 Now, the Bulgarian's guys have Brooks,<br />and the only way to save him
3150160 3152391 is to get that egg<br />from this Marlon Freeman guy.
3152480 3155075 I can't believe your brother's been<br />lying to us this whole time.
3155160 3156879 He's even cooler than we thought.
3156960 3159350 Honey, I think you sewed my arm<br />to my sleeve.
3159440 3161557 I didn't even know<br />Morgan Freeman collected Fabergé eggs.
3161640 3163438 Aren't those worth millions of dollars?
3163520 3165477 It's Marlon Freeman,<br />but that's just an alias.
3165560 3167631 Somehow, we gotta find out<br />his real name, find out his address.
3167720 3169871 - Police computer.<br />- What do you mean?
3169960 3172031 I once dated this girl<br />whose father was a cop.
3172120 3174077 She showed me her dad's police computer.
3174160 3176959 It has a database with<br />every known alias on it.
3177040 3179680 I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'<br />real name on it.
3179760 3182320 So, if we called her up, would she<br />let you go on her dad's computer?
3182400 3184710 No. No. No way! That ended badly.
3185000 3187799 So how are we gonna get into a police<br />computer without the cops knowing?
3187880 3189200 - Billy Bob Thornton!<br /><i>- What?</i>
3189280 3191317 - What?<br />- You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?
3191400 3195758 Hang on. Hang on. I know<br />where we can get on a police computer.
3196880 3199111 - Hey!<br />- Gary!
3199480 3200800 Goodness.
3201480 3203437 To what do<br />Bastian and I owe the pleasure?
3203600 3205000 Well, we were all just talking,
3205160 3207914 and we realized<br />we haven't had a game night in ages,
3208080 3209639 just the seven of us.
3209720 3210710 So...
3210800 3212757 I thought you were going<br />to your brother's house.
3212840 3213990 I never said that.
3214080 3216197 Come on, Gare Bear.<br />Live a little! It's the weekend!
3216280 3219398 We were just saying how you were always<br />better at games than Debbie was.
3219480 3221676 I'll thank you<br />not to besmirch my ex-wife.
3222120 3223600 That woman is an angel.
3223680 3227913 Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games<br />than you.
3228480 3234477 I will admit I have eagerly awaited<br />a visit such as this.
3240560 3241835 Where'd he go?
3242480 3243994 Do we follow him?
3244080 3245275 It seems like it.
3245360 3246999 - Ryan, you go first.<br />- I'm scared.
3253760 3256229 Help yourself to popped corn<br />with sea salt.
3256320 3258152 Oh! Oh!
3259040 3260520 <i>Yummy, yummy.</i>
3261040 3263635 I can't believe that you read my mind.<br />I was craving popcorn.
3263800 3266110 You have a framed photo of game night?
3266320 3270109 Doesn't everyone have photographs<br />of their best friends in their homes?
3271600 3273956 <i>Of course. We do.</i>
3274560 3276313 Max, uh, you wanna go first?
3276400 3278278 Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.
3278920 3280115 Oh. There's a loose one.
3280200 3282590 Always in the middle.<br />That's where you wanna go.
3282680 3284080 Can I use your john real quick?
3284160 3286550 Of course.<br />It's the end of the hall, next to our...
3290120 3291839 My bedroom.
3293320 3294356 Okay.
3316880 3318553 Oh, no, Gary.
3346200 3349716 So, Sarah, how long have you two<br />been a couple?
3350560 3353029 Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...
3353160 3356278 We work together. I wouldn't, um...<br />I wouldn't do that thing.
3356360 3361833 I see. I thought I detected a certain<br />chemistry between the two of you.
3361960 3364520 No. No way.
3365160 3367311 - No, that's not...<br />- Mmm. Mmm.
3367640 3371270 Then again, I'm not the best judge<br />of chemistry in the world.
3379240 3380390 Hmm.
3381000 3382673 Oh, because your wife left you.
3383240 3384469 Oh, shit.
3394200 3396351 Hello, Donald Anderton.
3405400 3407357 Oh!
3408040 3412557 So many possible moves.<br />I just don't know where to begin.
3414560 3416119 Um, maybe... Ooh...
3417440 3418920 - Decision-making.<br />- Come on, Annie. Just make up your mind.
3419080 3420639 - No!<br />- Please! No?
3422880 3425793 Yup, take your time.
3457880 3460679 Oh, Brooks. What have you<br />gotten yourself into?
3477960 3482034 Oh, shit. Where did you<br />come from, little guy?
3483400 3487280 Son of a bitch.<br />Hey! What are you, a vampire?
3487520 3490160 Oh, God. Oh, God.
3493040 3496397 Oh, my God. Has that got it?
3496560 3500440 No, that doesn't got it.<br />God damn it. Come on!
3504960 3505950 No!
3507840 3508830 I should go check on him.
3508920 3510195 I think he's fine.
3510560 3513553 - He cried out.<br />- Tell me about Debbie.
3516400 3517629 I beg your pardon.
3518360 3522832 Oh, just I... I never met her.<br />I'd love to hear all about her.
3533800 3535234 Where do I begin?
3535400 3537995 All right, you wanna take a bath?<br />We'll take a little bath.
3538160 3542951 There we go. Okay.<br />All right. Here we go.
3545200 3548034 There we go, huh? Huh?
3549520 3550715 Oh, it's so much worse.
3551400 3554837 Oh, God. And what did I do to this?<br />What the fuck is this thing?
3556360 3557476 Oh, Debbie.
3557560 3558755 Oh!
3566320 3568755 Okay. Fuck this.
3569360 3571192 Hey, guys, Gary was right.<br />It's awful late.
3571280 3573590 Let's get home, get to bed, huh?<br />Get out of his hair.
3573680 3575876 We haven't finished the game.<br />It's your turn, Max.
3576040 3577269 Oh, my turn, huh?
3577440 3579955 Okay, be careful now, Max.<br />Oh!
3580040 3581759 Well, game over. I went in a little hot.
3581920 3584833 - Why did you...<br />- Thanks! Good to see you, Gary.
3585000 3587117 When shall we play next?
3587200 3590193 Soon. We'll call you.
3595040 3597919 Bastian. Baby!
3599680 3603720 So, how are we supposed to get this egg<br />out of Donald Anderton's house?
3603800 3605439 I don't know. I'm gonna figure it out.
3606520 3609160 "Unknown Caller." Please don't be Gary.
3609240 3611835 - Hello?<br /><i>- We have your brother.</i>
3612720 3613870 Um...
3613960 3615474 Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,
3615560 3616676 and we're actually<br />on our way there right now.
3616800 3618473 We can do a swap, okay?<br />Please don't hurt Brooks.
3618560 3622474 <i>Meet us on the East 4th Street bridge<br />at midnight. If you're late, he dies.</i>
3622560 3623994 - Oh, my God.<br />- Um...
3624560 3627120 Boy, that's less than an hour from now.
3628560 3629630 Hello?
3629720 3632872 What's up with this guy's voice?<br />He sounds like a monster.
3633040 3634793 He's using a voice changer, Ryan.
3634880 3637190 He still sounds like a scary monster.
3640520 3644275 And we are here.
3644880 3645870 All right. You guys head home,
3645960 3647235 and I will call as soon<br />as I get the egg, all right?
3647320 3649471 What? Wait a second. Wait.<br />I'm going with you.
3649640 3651632 No, Annie. It could be very, very<br />dangerous in there, okay?
3651720 3653951 Listen, Brooks shouldn't have<br />dragged any of us into this,
3654040 3655713 but he is my brother,<br />and it's up to me to fix it.
3655800 3657871 No, bullshit!<br />We're all in this together!
3657960 3660077 No, no, no. Max is right.<br />You guys should go home,
3660240 3662436 but you and I are doing this.
3662600 3664956 Okay, what happens<br />if you guys don't make it out?
3665040 3667316 We don't come to game night because<br />we're dying to play charades and shit.
3667400 3668675 We come because we love you guys.
3668760 3670877 Honestly, this is<br />the best part of our week.
3670960 3674112 Mine, too. And I have<br />a lot of options on the weekend.
3674200 3676271 Wow. You guys...
3676400 3678392 Thank you. That's very nice.
3679120 3680918 Aw, good friends.
3681600 3684832 You should probably go, though, right?<br />I mean, you don't even know us.
3685240 3686799 Yeah, why are you still here?
3686880 3690237 Oh, I don't know.<br />I just got caught up in it.
3690320 3692312 Also, if I go home now,
3692400 3694153 and then I read in the newspaper<br />tomorrow that you all died,
3694240 3698200 I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,<br />so I'm gonna stick around.
3698960 3700997 You still read the newspaper?
3701160 3702958 That's what you got from that?
3703040 3705032 How are we gonna get into this place?
3706880 3708917 Go! Go! Go! Go!
3715360 3716840 Okay.
3718400 3721313 Looks like they got a party going on.<br />This could be good.
3733520 3735989 Where is everybody?
3751680 3752909 No way!
3761440 3763557 It's some kind of rich guy's fight club.
3763640 3766474 I knew it. They are real.
3770520 3771590 Come on!
3783000 3786391 That's my Boomer! That's my Boomer!
3787200 3789112 Man, this is some<br /><i>Django Unchained</i> bullshit.
3789200 3790190 Water!
3791120 3794477 That's my boy! Good boy! Good boy!
3794680 3796831 Rich people are fucked up!
3797000 3799151 Kramer, get Logan ready!
3799320 3802154 Okay, minimum buy in is now 10 grand.
3802360 3803714 Okay, I think we should split up.
3803880 3804996 Yeah. And let's start upstairs.
3805160 3806992 Anybody finds the egg,<br />just text the others, okay?
3807160 3808958 And for God's sake, be careful with it.<br />All right?
3809040 3810030 Got you. I got it.
3810160 3811276 Be safe.
3813440 3814715 What are you...<br />What are you doing?
3814880 3816155 Who says the egg isn't in here?
3817160 3819959 Also, I have a really good feeling<br />about Logan.
3820120 3823352 Egg, egg, egg.<br />Wow! This is some bedroom.
3823520 3825034 Does it remind you<br />of your celebrity boyfriend's?
3825200 3826350 Are you still on this?
3826480 3829040 Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.<br />That's all I can think about.
3829120 3830190 And that's saying a lot,
3830280 3833398 considering we got <i>Eyes Wide Fight Club</i><br />going on downstairs.
3833600 3835353 Why is this so important to you?
3835560 3839110 Because, Michelle, look,<br />I am losing my mind here. Okay?
3839280 3840680 We were broken up at the time.
3840840 3844151 I got a hand job from Karen Waller,<br />so you had every right to.
3844360 3845635 So why not just tell me?
3847720 3849757 Okay, fine.
3851520 3853000 <i>It was 10 years ago.</i>
3853200 3856910 <i>I was at a gas station,<br />and I noticed a guy at the next pump.</i>
3858760 3862231 <i>It was Denzel Washington.</i>
3862480 3863709 Hold up.
3865240 3867311 It actually was Denzel?
3867400 3868470 Yeah.
3872720 3874393 <i>He was really nice.</i>
3874480 3878269 <i>He made some joke about how premium gas<br />is probably the same as regular.</i>
3878360 3880955 <i>I took a chance, and I asked him<br />if he wanted to get drinks.</i>
3881040 3882269 <i>He said yes.</i>
3882920 3884434 <i>We both got a little tipsy.</i>
3884520 3886273 <i>I offered to pay for drinks,<br />and he let me,</i>
3886400 3887880 <i>which I thought was pretty cool.</i>
3889400 3891710 <i>We danced for hours.</i>
3894440 3896033 <i>Eventually, we ended up<br />back at his place,</i>
3896160 3899073 <i>and one thing led to another.</i>
3901040 3903953 It was just<br />this crazy thing that happened,
3904040 3905713 and, in a weird way, it made me realize
3905800 3909237 the only person<br />I ever wanna be with is you.
3911080 3912070 Nah.
3912560 3914040 Nah. I don't believe it.
3914320 3915959 - Oh, you...<br />- Mmm-mmm.
3916040 3917918 Well, I took a picture with him<br />at the club.
3918080 3919833 I put it in a hidden folder.
3920920 3922036 Denzel and Michelle.
3927840 3929320 Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.
3929600 3930829 Yeah, it is.
3931000 3932150 Mmm. No, it's not.
3932280 3934636 Dude looks a lot like Denzel,
3935400 3936470 but, uh, it's not him.
3936640 3938836 You're crazy. That's...<br />Look at that, that's Denzel.
3939000 3940912 Okay, let me ask you this.<br />Did he say he was Denzel?
3941120 3942520 Well, no.
3943440 3946080 He tried to introduce himself,<br />and I cut him off
3946160 3948470 because I told him I knew who he was.
3951040 3953111 - What kind of car did he drive?<br />- A BMW.
3953200 3954429 - Hmm.<br />- Three series.
3954520 3957240 Mmm. What was his place like?
3958040 3960396 It... It was a two-bedroom condo.
3962360 3966798 And he used the, um, spare room<br />as an office, so...
3967320 3968913 Do you hear<br />what you're saying right now?
3969080 3970639 Hold on, let me see.
3971640 3973836 When you zoom in,<br />the nose gives it away, right?
3975080 3976400 - God damn!<br />- Mmm-hmm.
3976480 3979473 Look, don't beat yourself up about it,<br />okay? There is some good news.
3979640 3982360 If you wanna get with Denzel, huh,
3982440 3984477 he's standing right here!
3984560 3989351 Because the real Denzel<br />ain't got shit on me.
3992080 3997200 I mean, how does this monster have<br />five kids? We don't get to have one.
3997920 4000116 Well, his wife looks like<br />she's about 15.
4000240 4003551 Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.
4003720 4005916 Right, right. No, I know, honey.<br />We're just gonna...
4006080 4009676 We're gonna keep plugging away<br />until something sticks, okay?
4009760 4012514 Gee, you really sound like a guy<br />who wants to have a kid.
4012640 4013676 Well, you know, I'm just...
4013800 4016918 I'm a little distracted right now,<br />honey, as you might imagine.
4017000 4020710 Look, if you're not into this,<br />you kind of gotta tell me.
4021320 4022310 Listen.
4023000 4026152 I wanna have a baby,<br />but how do I explain this? Um...
4027480 4030040 Do you remember how we used to play<br /><i>Pac-Man</i> at Fisker Lanes,
4030120 4031156 and we could play all night?
4031240 4033436 Do you remember, this one time,<br />I made it all the way up to level 86,
4033520 4035830 - and you were not too far behind, right?<br />- Eighty-five, but...
4035920 4037354 And then I kicked your ass at <i>Galaga.</i>
4037440 4039272 - So anyway, what is the point?<br />- Mmm... Anyway,
4039360 4041272 do you remember<br />how we stayed alive so long?
4041360 4043272 All we did was we ate the pellets.
4043360 4046080 We never ate the fruit<br />because the fruit is how they get you.
4047920 4049274 Oh, you're doing a metaphor!
4049360 4050840 Yes, but here's the problem.
4050920 4053389 No matter how long you and I<br />stayed alive in the game,
4053480 4055312 neither one of us ever made it<br />up to the leader board.
4056840 4058752 And you think if we have a baby,
4058840 4060240 we'll be officially settling down,
4060320 4062710 and you'll never make it<br />onto the leader board of life?
4062800 4064393 That's such a good metaphor.
4064480 4066756 Yeah, no, it's not.<br />It's kind of bullshit.
4066840 4067830 Why?
4067920 4069718 - What are we, 16 years old?<br />- No.
4069880 4072554 You wanna go backpacking<br />through Europe? Huh?
4072720 4075554 You wanna, like, have some wine coolers<br />on a football field
4075640 4077313 with Rebecca De Mornay?
4077480 4079153 Not specifically.
4079320 4081880 You know<br />who's always gone for the fruit, Max?
4082040 4086239 Your criminal brother, and that is why<br />the ghosts are about to eat him!
4086400 4088119 Look who's embracing the metaphor.
4088200 4089680 I'm so... I'm... Wow.
4090160 4092834 You know what? All this time,<br />I've just been thinking
4092920 4097039 that if I helped you beat Brooks,<br />you would be less stressed.
4097120 4100591 But you don't wanna beat Brooks.<br />You wanna be Brooks.
4102720 4104518 I'm gonna look somewhere else.
4117240 4119596 Come on, Logan! Boomer ain't shit!
4119680 4121160 Hey, ADHD!
4121240 4122560 We're supposed to be looking for the...
4125360 4128000 Holy shit. I'm right again.
4130120 4131713 Wait, where are you going?
4131800 4133712 Everybody's watching the fight.<br />I'm gonna go grab it.
4133800 4136634 - No, don't fucking...<br />- Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.
4148680 4149670 <i>Kill him!</i>
4151680 4153592 Oh, shit!
4157240 4158230 Who the hell are you?
4159280 4160270 Me?
4160360 4163353 Yeah. Who are you?<br />And what are you doing with my egg?
4164040 4166271 Oh. I was just admiring it.
4166360 4170400 I got a bunch of these fancy-pants eggs<br />back at home. In my mansion.
4170920 4173116 - Uh-huh.<br />- This one's ugly. Hmm.
4174640 4176040 Does anybody know this guy?
4176120 4181798 I certainly hope so.<br />I'm the CEO of Cyberdyne Systems.
4181880 4183439 I should go.
4184320 4185515 Boomer, take him down.
4185600 4187557 Everyone hold on a goddamn second!
4192120 4193270 Boomer!
4198160 4199150 Hey, any luck yet?
4199320 4200436 - No.<br />- You?
4200600 4204560 Go! Go! Go! I got it! I got it!<br />Let's go! Come on!
4214680 4215796 Sorry. Sorry.
4215960 4217155 Hey, Ryan! Ryan!
4217600 4218875 Oh, shit.
4219240 4220560 No!
4220640 4222074 Okay, okay.
4222160 4223514 Shit!
4226720 4230031 Michelle, I'm open! Hit me.<br />Hit me. Baby.
4232320 4233720 - Oh-ho-ho!<br />- Security!
4233880 4235200 No, you don't.
4235840 4237354 Holy shit!
4237440 4238669 Kev, up here! Throw it!
4238760 4239750 I got it!
4240440 4242716 Oh! Oh, my God, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes!
4243400 4247155 Oh, no! No! No! Get away! Get away!
4251160 4252753 Okay. Oh!
4253080 4254560 <i>Go to the other side!</i>
4254640 4255994 Oh, my God!
4256080 4258037 <i>Annie! Annie, where are you?</i>
4258120 4260840 - Max! Max!<br /><i>- Over here! Hey!</i>
4267840 4269035 <i>No, no, no!</i>
4271360 4272589 Get off me!
4276520 4277510 <i>No!</i>
4279600 4281592 That was easy.
4284040 4285759 Oh.
4290360 4293432 Man, glass tables<br />are acting weird tonight.
4294280 4295919 Go, go, go!
4296360 4298113 Get in! Get in the van!
4298200 4299793 Get in, get in, get in!
4299880 4301917 Get them! Get them!
4317440 4320831 So, you don't wanna have a baby,<br />so we can do more shit like that?
4321640 4323632 No. No.
4323960 4326191 Is that the fruit<br />you were thinking about?
4326360 4328238 Mmm-mmm.<br />That's not the fruit. No.
4328400 4329914 Hey, thanks for the assist.
4330080 4331560 Yeah.
4332040 4334396 I don't even know why<br />I really did it.
4335120 4336634 Do you think<br />it's 'cause you're falling for me?
4339160 4340150 I...
4341040 4342713 Not... Not sure.
4343040 4345635 Ugh. I was joking.
4345800 4347359 Oh. Okay. Yeah.
4348400 4350357 Aren't you gonna say<br />you were joking, too?
4350520 4351749 Do you want me to?
4351920 4353195 - Oh, my God, you're making this weird.<br />- No, I'm not.
4353360 4354874 - Stop it.<br />- Okay, fine.
4354960 4356917 It's two minutes to 12:00.<br />Where the hell is this bridge?
4357080 4360118 GPS says it's right around here,<br />but I don't see it.
4360200 4361998 Oh, oh. Oh. There it is. 4th Street.
4362080 4363196 Oh, shit!
4369480 4371472 - Oh, my!<br />- That's great.
4372040 4374157 That's great.<br />Now they're gonna kill my brother.
4376200 4377270 Oh, God!
4377840 4379240 Hold on.
4380240 4383438 I'm not an expert,<br />but these gems look plastic to me.
4383520 4385716 "Made in China."<br />Is this thing not even real?
4385800 4387598 Maybe just that sticker<br />was made in China.
4387680 4388716 - Let's let them talk.<br />- Can I see?
4389040 4391839 <i>Hey, why would the Bulgarian<br />ask Brooks to bring him a fake egg?</i>
4391920 4394913 Uh, I don't think he wanted<br />an egg at all.
4395000 4397993 I think he wanted<br />what was inside the egg.
4398960 4401077 "WITSEC." What is that?
4401200 4402236 Um...
4402320 4403993 We could ask them?
4421320 4423198 You tell anyone<br />we were coming here?
4423360 4424680 No.
4424840 4425990 I've got your egg.
4426080 4427070 You do?
4427160 4428640 Yeah, but we broke it.
4428800 4430234 - What?<br />- Well, it was a fake.
4430360 4431919 But we have the list of names<br />that was inside.
4432000 4433400 That's what you wanted, right?
4436800 4438871 Okay. Get on the ground.
4438960 4440758 We've got what you want.<br />Can't you just let us go?
4440840 4443116 I said, "On the ground!"
4444040 4445759 You, too, playboy, get over there.<br />Get on the ground.
4445840 4446956 <i>Yeah.</i>
4447040 4448156 <i>None of that<br />child pose bullshit, either.</i>
4449440 4452000 The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,<br />probably you guys, too.
4452160 4453389 Why did you come here?
4453680 4455399 Because you're my brother,<br />and I can't just let you die,
4455480 4456550 even though you might deserve it.
4456680 4458797 Yeah, it's me. We got them all here.
4458960 4461555 You're unbelievable, you know that?
4461720 4463871 You've always<br />been a better person than me.
4464040 4465633 You gotta shut up. Okay?
4465800 4468713 Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.
4468880 4471554 I'm not the carefree dude<br />that wins at everything he touches.
4471640 4474075 You know how I win?<br />I cheat. I cheat at everything.
4474160 4476277 I even cheated when we were kids<br />playing <i>Battleship.</i>
4478000 4479229 What?
4479320 4482791 Didn't you ever wonder why I made you<br />sit with your back to the TV?
4482880 4485679 It was so I could see your ships<br />in the reflection.
4485760 4489276 I mean, I even took five grand<br />every time we played <i>Monopoly</i>
4489360 4490874 before we even started playing the game.
4491040 4494431 I cheated at the <i>Game of Life.</i><br />And at the game of life.
4494600 4495920 You son of a bitch.
4496000 4498196 - You son of a bitch!<br /><i>- Sit down.</i>
4499280 4501158 - What about you, Princess?<br />- I don't have anything.
4501320 4504757 But it didn't stop there<br />because, when we grew up, Max,
4504840 4507116 you went off to college, and I...
4508200 4510237 You got a career.
4510440 4513035 You married the greatest girl<br />in the world.
4513200 4515032 I knew I couldn't keep up<br />with that success.
4515200 4517078 So I...
4517280 4519397 I told everyone that I got a job<br />on Wall Street.
4519560 4520960 And I did.
4521160 4523914 Selling coke to traders.
4525280 4526430 You didn't invest in Panera?
4526600 4528000 I ate at Panera.
4528160 4529719 Jesus Christ.
4529800 4531598 What's going on?
4531680 4533478 But that's why I've been trying<br />to make it up to you.
4533560 4534880 That's what this whole game night<br />was about.
4534960 4537953 See, I had it rigged<br />so that you'd finally win.
4539000 4541913 The last clue was gonna lead you...
4542000 4543320 Your jacket pocket.
4553080 4554514 Huh.
4556920 4558673 Surprise!
4561880 4564839 I even managed to fuck that up, though.<br />I'm so sorry.
4564920 4566912 I'm so sorry, Max.
4568800 4570951 I think we're gonna be okay, though.<br />I got a feeling.
4571040 4572235 You want us to kill them all?
4573320 4574356 What?
4574440 4576033 - Okay.<br /><i>- Wait, wait. Just let us go.</i>
4576120 4577236 We won't tell anyone anything.
4577320 4578959 We got you the list!
4579280 4581715 - What the fuck, man?<br />- Fuck! God damn it!
4583720 4584949 - Oh, shit. The fuzz.<br />- Fuck, man!
4585040 4586360 Freeze!
4586600 4587636 <i>Gary?</i>
4587720 4588756 Don't even think about it, pig.
4588840 4590399 Can't say I care for that nomenclature.
4593680 4594796 Get down!
4595640 4597393 Come on, bitch!
4598960 4599950 Motherfucker!
4604720 4606120 God damn it!
4614240 4615674 Hey, isn't that your neighbor?
4616160 4617355 <i>When did Gary get so cool?</i>
4617440 4618476 Oh, my God!
4618560 4619676 Everybody okay?
4619800 4621393 - You're a cool-ass cat, Gary.<br />- You all right?
4621480 4623073 Fine, thank you,
4623880 4627590 though, in sliding, my belt buckle<br />may have inadvertently scratched
4627680 4629239 the finish of my squad car.
4629320 4630913 How did you know we were in trouble?
4631000 4633151 The nocturnal <i>Jenga</i> game,
4634040 4636236 my blood-spattered marital souvenirs,
4636360 4639990 and Max's curious search history<br />piqued my interest.
4640080 4642436 - Right. Oh, God.<br />- You, uh...
4642520 4644239 You saved our lives.
4644320 4645470 Thank you.
4646120 4647349 Just doing my job.
4649160 4650310 - Oh, my God!<br />- Oh!
4650400 4652471 - Shit!<br />- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
4653680 4654716 Gary!
4656160 4657753 <i>Hello? I need an ambulance.<br />Officer down.</i>
4657880 4659314 - Oh, shit!<br />- Hang in there, pal.
4659400 4660754 <i>Hang on. Hang on, pal.</i>
4660840 4661956 Hang on. You're gonna be all right.
4662040 4663156 We're gonna get you to a hospital.
4663240 4664879 Okay, look at me. Gary, look.
4664960 4666917 You have got a lot to live for, okay?
4667000 4667990 Do I?
4668080 4669560 - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br />- Yeah.
4669640 4671518 I have no wife.
4672960 4674633 - No friends.<br />- That's not true.
4674800 4675916 No, don't say that.
4676080 4677799 - You got us. We're your friends.<br />- You've got us.
4677960 4682432 You don't even like<br />spending time with me.
4682520 4683840 Yes, we do. We just...
4683920 4685593 We've been a little selfish. That's all.
4685680 4687353 - Right, right.<br />- You know, I'm sorry about that.
4687440 4688430 Oh, God. Oh, God.
4688520 4690318 - Bastian.<br />- Huh?
4691680 4694275 Someone please take care of Bastian.
4694360 4697512 Gary, you are gonna take care of Bastian<br />yourself, okay?
4697600 4698716 Listen, soon as you get out<br />of the hospital,
4698800 4700439 you're gonna come to every single<br />game night we have.
4702000 4703320 Don't...
4703680 4704750 Yeah?
4704840 4707753 Don't you ever
4709600 4711592 exclude me again.
4711680 4714559 - Never exclude you again, pal.<br />- No.
4716320 4718630 - Oh, God. What is that?<br />- What's that?
4718720 4720677 Is that a blood clot?
4721240 4723550 It's a blood capsule.
4723640 4725313 - Huh?<br />- A blood capsule?
4726200 4729910 And that is how<br />you do a game night.
4733560 4734630 What?
4736760 4738399 I've duped you all.
4738480 4739470 Wha...
4740400 4743677 Hold on a second. Are you telling me<br />that this whole thing was a game?
4746240 4747469 - What? What?<br />- Damn!
4747560 4748550 Shit!
4748680 4750399 I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.
4750480 4752711 When I learned you stopped inviting me<br />to your game nights,
4752800 4755599 I hijacked<br />Brooks's murder mystery party,
4755680 4757512 and I staged a kidnapping of my own.
4757600 4759080 You gotta be kidding me.
4759160 4762358 What better way to prove my worth<br />as a game night participant?
4762440 4764477 Well, what about these dudes?<br />Are they actors?
4764560 4766517 Oh, no. They're... They're felons.
4766600 4767590 Felons?
4767680 4769273 I was able to shave some time off<br />of their parole
4769360 4771556 in exchange<br />for this little side project.
4771800 4772916 We square now?
4773000 4774320 Thank you, gentlemen.
4774400 4775675 That lady hit me with the car.
4775760 4777319 Hey, what the hell kind of psycho<br />are you?
4777400 4779995 You put us through all this,<br />just for your own amusement?
4780080 4783437 No, no. Just the opposite.<br />For your amusement.
4783520 4784670 Did everyone have fun?
4784800 4786439 - No! No.<br />- Yeah. No.
4786520 4788159 No fun! I got shot!
4788240 4789310 By me!
4789400 4791960 I don't see how that's possible.<br />My men were using blanks.
4792040 4793997 Well, that was my gun.<br />It was a real gun.
4794080 4796754 So, this whole thing, the Fabergé egg,
4796840 4798354 the Bulgarian, that was you?
4800040 4801110 You've lost me.
4801200 4803351 The egg, the WITSEC list?
4803440 4805477 It's all you. All part of your game?
4809080 4811595 This is a list of people in<br />the Federal Witness Protection program.
4811680 4812796 How did you get this?
4812880 4815270 From inside the egg.<br />Stop fucking with us. It's over!
4815360 4818080 I'm not fudging with you.<br />I honestly have no idea what...
4820080 4822436 Oh, boy. Yikes!
4823320 4825039 - I mean, how stupid do you think we are?<br />- Hey, Max.
4825120 4827157 Gang, are we looking<br />at the big twist here?
4827240 4828754 He gets shot again!
4828840 4831435 And by who? A couple of new characters<br />you introduce at the last minute.
4831520 4833034 Dude, you've jumped the shark!
4833120 4834713 Do you go to the magic shop
4834800 4836598 - to buy a bunch of these little bullets?<br />- No.
4839120 4840474 Hang on.
4840560 4843519 This is Officer Kingsbury.<br />We got a 10-00 on the 4th Street.
4846520 4848751 Which one of you is Brooks Davis?
4851560 4854200 It's funny.<br />You don't look like an asshole.
4854960 4856997 Do I look like an asshole to you?
4857560 4858630 No.
4858720 4860996 One of us has to be the asshole<br />in this transaction
4861080 4863675 because otherwise I'd have my egg,<br />and you'd have your money.
4863760 4867117 But instead, we've wasted our night<br />tracking you down.
4868880 4870599 Now, we're gonna have to kill you.
4870680 4872319 - What? No, no, no, no.<br />- What?
4872680 4874114 Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?
4874280 4877159 Hi, I'm Max.<br />I'm Brooks's brother.
4877240 4879311 And, you know, look. He screwed up.
4879400 4880595 - Right? You got greedy.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4880680 4881716 He admits it.
4881800 4883678 Good news is, though,<br />that we got your egg.
4884160 4886516 It is broken. Uh, my screw up.
4886600 4889069 But, um, I got the list.
4889160 4890958 <i>which I bet you've been after<br />this whole time.</i>
4891040 4892030 What about this?
4892120 4894032 How about
4894680 4898674 you take this list for free,<br />and we all go our separate ways?
4898760 4900717 Nobody gets hurt.
4900800 4903759 Uh, except the poor folks on this list,<br />I'm guessing.
4905960 4907076 Okay.
4907760 4908750 Okay?
4908880 4911440 Deal. Makes perfect sense.
4911520 4913273 No, no. You give him that list,<br />he's gonna kill me.
4913560 4914880 That's nonsense.
4917800 4919632 What the hell is wrong with you?
4920120 4922077 I'm just trying to buy myself some time.
4922160 4925232 Not much. We're just gonna<br />cut it out of you on the jet. Take him.
4928800 4930473 Don't follow us, Max. I'm serious!
4930560 4932677 I'm not worried about that.
4936320 4937800 You just letting them go?
4937880 4939951 Yeah, they've done nothing wrong.
4940080 4942072 Only this one.
4942400 4943834 - Let's go.<br />- Don't follow us!
4943920 4945957 Gary! He's breathing.
4947120 4949316 You know, the only private air terminal<br />around here is at Conway.
4949400 4950959 Yeah. How are we gonna get there?
4951480 4952880 Brooks's house is<br />not that far from here.
4952960 4954076 But our car's not there.
4955280 4956430 Yeah, it is.
4966320 4969040 You know, you don't have to do this<br />because I can just poop it out.
4969880 4973191 We're not gonna go digging<br />through your feces. That's disgusting!
4973320 4975357 Now, hold still<br />while I cut your stomach open.
4975440 4976760 No, no! No! Whoa!
4978040 4979315 What the hell?
4981600 4983398 - Is that...<br />- That's my brother.
4983480 4985039 Get us in the air.
4985120 4986110 Now!
4997240 4998276 - Hold on!<br />- Oh!
5001920 5003195 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, you?
5003280 5004396 - Yup, good.<br />- Okay.
5009080 5010673 Okay, okay. What's our plan?
5010760 5012160 I have one idea.
5012240 5014516 It's so crazy, though, baby,<br />it just might work.
5014600 5015716 You're gonna<br />crash the car into the plane,
5015800 5017632 like Liam Neeson in <i>Taken 3?</i>
5018000 5019593 He did that in <i>Taken 3,</i> huh?
5024160 5025879 - All right, are you ready? Here we go!<br />- Uh-huh.
5027640 5029233 Oh, my God!
5032600 5034353 Uh, you missed it.
5034440 5035590 Thanks, baby.
5040680 5041750 Brooks, we're coming!
5041840 5042910 Whoo!
5061160 5064631 Well, at least I got<br />to drive it for 10 minutes.
5066880 5067996 Oh, my God.
5068160 5069276 - We have to hide.<br />- Yeah.
5069440 5070556 Okay. Go.
5070640 5073792 Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!
5074040 5075599 Go, go, go! It's stuck.
5076960 5078030 Fuck!
5078960 5080360 <i>God damn it!</i>
5098320 5099595 Where you at, lady?
5099680 5101672 Come on, you little bitch.
5102640 5104472 <i>I know you're back here somewhere.</i>
5106000 5108799 Let's end this shit.<br />I won't kill you. Come out!
5109840 5111718 <i>Come on, get your ass out here!</i>
5111880 5113109 Turn on the belt!
5113200 5114190 What?
5114280 5115600 <i>- I'm not gonna hurt you.</i><br />- Look at the box!
5115680 5118070 <i>- Let's talk!</i><br />- Can you charade it to me?
5118160 5119992 Charades?
5120600 5122796 That's some cute full-circle bullshit.
5122880 5124519 Here we go. Three words.
5124640 5125756 Come on, lady.
5125840 5126876 Where are you?
5129320 5130356 Turn.
5130440 5131635 Turn, turn, turn. Turn.
5132120 5133156 On.
5133240 5136074 Turn on. Turn on what? Turn on what?
5137600 5139671 Turn on belt?
5139840 5142400 Turn on belt!
5151360 5153591 Boy, that's a slow belt.
5164560 5166074 Hey!
5166440 5168750 Oh, God! Annie!
5171440 5172999 Oh, boy, that was...
5173080 5174230 You saw what I was going for,<br />though, right?
5174320 5175310 Yeah, yeah.
5175440 5177671 But then did you see when I hit him<br />with the fire extinguisher?
5177760 5179956 - I sure did. I sure did, yeah.<br />- That was cool, right? Yeah.
5180040 5181110 - Yeah.<br />- Great.
5181200 5182190 Do you want this?
5182320 5184516 Well, I don't want you to have it,<br />Calamity Jane.
5184600 5185795 All right, look.
5185880 5188156 I think I saw a hatch<br />at the top of the plane.
5188240 5189560 Maybe I can get the drop on him.
5189640 5191074 - "The drop"?<br />- Yup, yeah.
5191160 5192150 Who are you?
5192240 5193276 Why don't you go use<br />the emergency phone? Call for help.
5193360 5194350 I'm gonna do the drop.
5194440 5196397 Okay. You're not Liam Neeson!
5196480 5198392 - That hurts my feelings!<br />- I'm sorry!
5208560 5210233 That's enough of this shit.
5230280 5231270 Max!
5232760 5234114 I can't get the drop on anyone tonight.
5234200 5235395 Put that little knife down!
5235480 5237073 Right now! That's it.
5237520 5239113 Ahh!
5239520 5241352 Right in my bullet hole.
5246400 5248153 Come on, come on, come on.
5251960 5252950 Shit!
5257560 5258550 Stop!
5259880 5261200 Drop it!
5263040 5264076 Wait, wait. Um...
5264440 5267990 You don't have to do this.<br />I have kids at home.
5268600 5270080 Not with that ass you don't.
5270480 5271596 Oh.
5271680 5273319 Well, thank you.
5273640 5274710 You're welcome.
5277680 5279797 Shit!
5281640 5283074 Yes!
5283880 5285872 Oh, no, he died!
5316480 5318995 And that's how<br />you get the drop on someone!
5319080 5320150 Oh, my God!
5321000 5322400 Oh. Oh!
5322480 5324358 - I got you! I got you!<br />- This is high.
5326120 5327156 You're amazing.
5327240 5328754 - You can cut me loose now.<br />- Thank you!
5328920 5330115 Okay. Okay, okay.
5330280 5332033 - Uh...<br />- Yeah. In the bag.
5332200 5333953 - This? Okay.<br />- Look in the bag. That's right.
5334240 5335469 Okay.
5335880 5336916 Oh! Thank you!
5337000 5338957 - Okay. You all right?<br />- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
5341840 5342910 Whoa.
5343000 5344275 <i>Well, look at that.</i>
5344480 5346119 <i>You put a bungee cord in your hand,</i>
5346200 5348157 you go straight to the pervy place,<br />don't you?
5348280 5349270 Hey.
5349360 5351079 You saved my life. Thank you.
5351560 5352960 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
5353040 5355555 I mean, I just saw a man die,<br />but I'm... I'm okay.
5356960 5358838 Is that a knife in your bullet hole?
5358920 5360559 Uh-huh. Hey. I wanna have a baby.
5361120 5362236 Uh, what?
5362320 5363549 I used to think that<br />I wanted Brooks' life,
5363640 5365313 but, you know, turns out he was just...
5365400 5366959 You're a loser. He's a loser.
5367040 5368076 Uh, guilty.
5368160 5369674 But us making a family?
5369880 5372918 That's... That's not pellets.<br />That's the fruit.
5373080 5374799 That's fruit. It's fruit.
5374880 5376200 Wait. What's going on?
5376480 5378756 Plus, think about all the dumdums<br />that have kids, right?
5378840 5381400 And think about how much better<br />our kid is gonna be than their kids.
5381520 5383352 It's gonna beat their kids<br />at everything.
5383480 5384994 It's taken you this long to see that?
5385080 5386992 Our baby is gonna crush<br />every other baby.
5387080 5388992 That's right. That's right.<br />And not in that "peak too early,"
5389080 5390309 you know, "kid actor" kind of way,<br />you know?
5390400 5391390 Mmm-mmm. No.
5391480 5393437 We will parcel out<br />his or her gifts over time.
5393520 5394590 - Absolutely.<br />- Yes.
5394680 5395955 We gotta teach it Mandarin right away.
5396040 5397030 'Cause China's the future.
5397160 5398389 - It sure is.<br />- Yeah.
5398480 5400199 - You're the future.<br />- Oh, my God.
5403600 5405114 Hmm?
5406080 5408515 And that concludes my game night.
5409320 5410595 What?
5410680 5411670 It went exactly as I planned.
5411800 5414872 You learned every lesson<br />that I wanted you to.
5414960 5416792 Trevor, you can get up now.
5422000 5424674 I'm just fucking with you, but that<br />would've been really cool, right?
5424760 5426194 You're such a dick.
5435960 5437997 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Hey!
5439240 5440674 - Hey, hey!<br />- Hey!
5440840 5443674 Come on, come on. Hey, thanks<br />for letting me host again, huh?
5443840 5445638 Well, it's not like we had a choice.
5445800 5447553 Only 36 months to go.
5447720 5448915 Oh, time will fly.
5449000 5450195 - Can I get you a beer?<br />- Uh, yeah.
5450280 5451839 - Come on!<br />- Hey, listen, Brooks.
5452240 5454960 I know you're probably feeling<br />pretty humbled by all of this.
5455040 5458317 But, honestly, I think you're gonna come<br />out the other side a much better man.
5458720 5459870 Oh! Hey, look.
5459960 5461360 I completely agree.
5461440 5463113 You remember the WITSEC list<br />I swallowed?
5463200 5464395 - Sure.<br />- I pooped it out,
5464520 5467194 sold it for $3 million<br />on the black market.
5468080 5469912 - Are you serious?<br />- Pretty sweet, huh?
5470640 5472632 Brooks, everybody on that list<br />is gonna get killed.
5472800 5474120 Oh, no, Max, I'm not a monster.
5474320 5476516 I tipped everyone off<br />that they were in danger.
5476680 5478637 For $20,000 apiece.
5479760 5480989 You're unbelievable.
5481120 5483555 Thank you. It's not like<br />I'm gonna live in this dump forever.
5483640 5486280 As soon as this cuff comes off,<br />I'm gonna buy that house I was renting.
5486360 5487680 I'm moving in with Johanna.
5488280 5489350 There she is.
5489440 5490476 Hey, Dr. Chin!
5490560 5492040 Hey, Max.
5492120 5493474 - Let's play.<br />- Yeah.
5494280 5495430 Uh, <i>The Crying Game?</i>
5495840 5496876 Uh, <i>Boys Don't Cry?</i>
5496960 5498872 <i>Is that a tear? No, is that the actor?</i>
5499040 5500235 <i>- Mr. Potato Head.<br />- Are you drawing the actor?</i>
5500400 5501470 <i>- Cry-Baby?</i><br />- Yes!
5501600 5502670 Time!
5502760 5504638 - It was <i>The Green Mile.</i><br />- What?
5504720 5506279 How is that <i>The Green Mile?</i>
5506880 5509315 This is me at the Regal Cinema crying
5509440 5511909 as I did through much of the film.
5513000 5514480 How were we supposed to know that, Gary?
5514640 5517838 I assume everyone cried<br />during <i>The Green Mile.</i>
5518800 5519790 So, who's next?
5519880 5520870 I'll go.
5520960 5522280 - Yeah!<br />- Go, baby!
5522360 5523350 - Yeah!<br />- Nice try, Gary.
5523520 5525034 And go!
5525600 5526636 Uh...
5526720 5528234 <i>- It's a rock.<br />- A bean? A rock!</i>
5528400 5529675 <i>- A ball?<br />- That's a...</i>
5529760 5530955 - Burger. Is that a burger?<br /><i>- Football! Football!</i>
5531200 5532714 No, oh,<br />that's a dinner roll, right?
5532800 5533995 - A bun!<br /><i>- Bread?</i>
5534080 5535878 Is it a bun? Looks like a bun.
5535960 5536950 <i>French loaf?</i>
5537040 5539157 - Is this a motion picture?<br /><i>- Bun is in a house. On a train.</i>
5539240 5540390 Aren't you supposed<br />to announce it?
5540480 5542073 - Microwave?<br />- It's being cooked. It's in an oven.
5542360 5543714 - Bun in the oven!<br /><i>- Yes, yes, yes!</i>
5543920 5546799 Wait. What?
5547200 5548634 Yes.
5549760 5550830 You pregnant?
5550920 5552400 We did it.
5560520 5562796 Oh, my gosh!<br />They're having a baby!
5562880 5564519 They're having a baby!
5974120 5975395 How you doing?
5975480 5977392 <i>- Hi.</i><br />- I'm Kenny.
5977480 5979073 <i>Nice to meet you, Kenny.</i>
5980320 5983233 Usually people cut me off<br />and say they know who I am.
5983320 5986438 <i>- Oh, yeah?</i><br />- Yeah. I didn't catch your name.
5987280 5988794 I'm Debbie.
