41360 44750 - (PEOPLE CHEERING)<br />- MAX: Whoo!
44840 47035 (LAUGHS) Who cares about winning?<br />Let's get drunk!
47720 49199 Let's do it.
49280 51748 - Let's get you drunk, Merkins.<br />- You, too, Borgs.
51840 53671 I'm thirsty. Huh?
54880 57189 I need four shots of vodka,<br />four shots of water.
57280 59176 I want you to send the vodka<br />over to the Merkins.
59200 60918 Send the water to us. You understand?
61000 62696 CARTER: What former<br />Supreme Court Justice...
62720 64312 - Oliver Wendell Holmes!<br />- Correct.
64400 65753 ALL: Yes!
65840 68479 Again, I'd like to ask the players<br />to allow me to...
68560 70198 To finish the question.
70360 71713 - (ALL LAUGHING)<br />- Very funny.
71920 73911 Okay, okay.<br />This is getting embarrassing,
74000 75877 so we need to focus
76040 77473 because this isn't a game.
77680 79159 It literally is.
79320 81595 Bill, do not test me right now.
81680 83360 CARTER: Looks like<br />we're down to two teams.
83760 85910 So, for double points,
86000 88275 what is the name<br />of the purple Teletubby?
89080 91640 - BOTH: Tinky Winky!<br />- CARTER: You're both correct.
93120 94758 He always carried a...
94920 96672 - Red purse.<br />- Yeah.
96840 99479 - And he loved big hugs.<br />- Big hugs.
99640 101551 I know. I'm Max.
101720 103073 Annie.
121120 123136 Ha-ha! You're never gonna be able<br />to hold on to Asia! You hear me?
123160 125310 Hey, if you take Kamchatka,<br />and I take Mongolia,
125520 126880 we could trap Linda in the middle.
126920 128056 - MAX: Starve out her armies.<br />- Hey!
128080 129229 You can't form alliances.
129440 131078 Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?
131240 132958 You're high-fiving Hitler?
135280 137111 MAX: All right, you got this. Last one.
137800 140439 Oh, that's Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.
140640 141789 - (ALL GROAN)<br />- Yes!
141960 142960 I'm up. I feel good.
143160 144195 Two words.
144360 145873 Bill. Overweight.
146080 147195 - No.<br />- Single. Out of work.
147280 148280 What the fuck?
148360 149679 Hairy.
149840 151319 Uh, carry, marry.
151480 152549 Marry!
152720 154358 You. Me.
154440 155440 Marry me?
155520 157160 - (WHOOPING)<br />- Dude, we got it! We got it!
157640 159710 Annie, will you?
159800 161279 - (GASPS)<br />- Will you marry me?
161360 162840 - Is that a yes? That's a yes!<br />- Yeah!
162960 165110 I'm really happy for you guys.
165840 168400 (ALL CHEERING)
179000 180720 - ANNIE: Ooh, lot of pressure here.<br />- MAX: Yeah.
180800 182120 ANNIE: You miss, you lose it all.
182200 183235 MAX: Stay out of my head.
183320 185256 And you know you have a distinct<br />advantage with the smaller hands, right?
185280 186759 Your goal posts are not as big.
186920 188696 Well, I guess you<br />should've married Uma Thurman.
188720 189960 Yeah, that would've been great.
190000 192200 - There's a snap. Here's the hold.<br />- (CELL PHONE CHIMES)
192800 194279 - Ooh!<br />- And a text.
194360 195554 That was interference.
195640 197296 ANNIE: Sorry, honey. I know how much<br />that meant to you.
197320 198878 MAX: Come on.
198960 200279 Dr. Chin is ready for you.
200360 201429 Uh, great.
201520 204193 I think we've determined why you've<br />been having trouble conceiving.
204360 206954 - MAX: Okay. Let's have it.<br />- ANNIE: Okay, great.
207120 209315 Oh, what's that look? Is it me?<br />Of course, it's me.
209400 211470 I'm not loving your semen.
211560 212629 Oh?
212720 215712 Your count is excellent,<br />but your motility is well below normal.
215880 217757 - That's too bad.<br />- What would cause that?
217920 220753 It can be genetic,<br />environmental factors.
220920 223229 Nine times out of 10, though,<br />it's psychological.
223400 225914 Have you been feeling<br />anxious or stressed?
226120 228236 No, I don't think so. Not really.
228400 229879 Uh... He's always a little stressed.
230800 232056 You don't have to write... I'm not...
232080 233240 Honey, she's writing it down.
233360 236591 Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.
236720 237720 We sure are.
237840 239416 One of the reasons<br />I fell in love with him.
239440 243274 Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more<br />prone to stress than normal people.
243440 245351 "Normal people"?
245440 246776 How long has this been going on, Max?
246800 247994 It's not going on.
248480 250948 Oh, well, you did say,<br />even when you were a kid,
251040 253110 you would freak out<br />if you lost at anything.
253560 255816 - Oh, I was a kid.<br />- Especially if you lost to your brother.
255840 256955 Hmm.
257600 259397 Hey, is that what this is?
259480 260480 No.
260560 264269 You have been so uptight since you<br />found out that Brooks is coming to town.
264360 265936 - I don't think that's true.<br />- Could that be a factor in all this?
265960 266960 Let's be fair.
267040 269349 Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.
269440 271510 Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.
271680 273272 - The what?<br />- The brothers.
273440 276000 I'm not sure why we're discussing this.<br />She's not a therapist.
276160 278151 You're not a therapist, right?<br />With all respect.
278320 279833 - No, but I am a doctor.<br />- Sure.
279920 281876 And I believe in<br />treating the whole patient.
281960 285032 So, what is it about your brother<br />that makes you feel emasculated?
285200 286633 Are we gonna do this?
286800 288616 We're right next to the room<br />where I masturbated.
288640 292030 I think he has it in his head<br />that Brooks is cooler
292120 295192 and more successful<br />and hotter than he is.
295280 296554 I never said hotter.
296720 298199 He's charming.
298400 300675 That's interesting. And is he single?
300840 301840 MAX: What's that?
301920 305196 I don't know if I mentioned it, but<br />Keith and I are on a trial separation.
305280 306599 - Oh.<br />- Keith?
307160 308195 Uh, Keith.
308280 310536 So, do you think your brother would<br />wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?
310560 311629 Gosh, I don't know.
311800 313199 Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.
313360 314793 Hurts a little. (SCOFFS)
315000 317389 Now, is he a tall fellow?<br />'Cause I'm only 5'2".
317560 318913 We're all done with my semen?
319080 320513 He is taller than Max.
320680 322910 - Good.<br />- But he did date this ballerina once,
323000 324797 and she was<br />just a teeny-tiny little thing.
344000 345274 Ooh.
345360 347715 Honey, Gary.<br />Don't mention game night, okay?
347800 348835 Mmm-hmm.
348920 350717 - Good evening, Max.<br />- Hey, Gary.
350880 352074 - Annie.<br />- Hello there.
352240 353832 Hi, Gary!
354320 355833 Just checking the mail.
355920 356955 Oh, yeah?
357040 358616 Some people check it earlier in the day,
358640 362474 but there's always a risk<br />that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.
363480 367837 This spares me the chance<br />of a futile trip to the mailbox.
369480 370629 Uh-huh.
370720 375032 Plus, it allows Bastian here<br />the opportunity to urinate.
376120 377838 You have a good one.
378000 379194 Any plans for this evening?
379360 380634 MAX: No.
381280 382679 Perhaps a game night?
382840 384239 We're just gonna stay in,
384360 385634 - just the two of us.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
385720 387312 - Boring.<br />- Mmm.
387480 388799 I see.
390000 394835 I do hope you keep me in mind<br />for any future game nights.
395040 396040 You bet.
396120 399829 I've always enjoyed<br />the camaraderie of good friends
400040 402952 competing in games of chance and skill.
403520 406273 (STAMMERING) Yeah.<br />Yeah, well, we'll do that,
406440 410069 but tonight, it's just the two of us.
410680 413752 Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.
419640 421949 There was a special on these tonight.
422440 423589 Three for one.
423760 425159 Three for one?
425800 426835 Yup.
426920 429115 How can that be profitable<br />for Frito Lay?
430360 432237 These corporations,
433600 435440 - I don't know what they're doing.<br />- (CHUCKLES)
435840 438400 Well, you two enjoy each other.
439200 443671 It's often we don't appreciate<br />what we have until it's gone.
448080 449672 - MAX: I think that's it.<br />- ANNIE: Okay.
449880 450995 Bye-bye!
457280 459510 If Gary sees the others coming,<br />we're screwed.
459680 460936 No, no, honey,<br />it's not gonna be a problem.
460960 463076 I was very, very clear with everyone<br />to park far away
463240 465117 and just to sneak in quietly, you know.
465280 467794 But now, I mean, you don't think<br />we're being dicks, do you?
467960 469416 I mean,<br />should we just still invite the guy?
469440 470656 He really seemed like he wanted to play.
470680 472511 No, no. Debbie was our friend,
472680 474856 and Gary was just the creepy husband<br />that we had to put up with.
474880 475880 That's true.
475960 477496 He's only gotten worse<br />since the divorce.
477520 480273 - Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?<br />- Fuck him!
480360 481509 (RUSTLING)
501840 502840 (ANNIE SCREAMS)
506880 507995 Hi!
508160 509559 Hi.
512960 514552 ANNIE: Can we help you?
514720 515914 I'm okay.
516280 517280 Hey!
517440 519376 Of course. Ryan, why are you<br />coming in through the window?
519400 522676 You said sneak in<br />so RoboCop wouldn't see us.
522840 524200 I meant sneak in through the door.
524320 525514 Well, you were super vague.
525680 526920 - I wasn't vague at all.<br />- Wine?
527040 528616 I know I didn't say,<br />"Break the succulents."
528640 530870 - RYAN: Hey.<br />- I'm not dressed for this nonsense.
530960 531960 This is ridiculous.
532040 533096 It's like<br />Night of the Living Dead in here.
533120 534720 Yeah, you are asking a lot from us, Max.
534800 536216 MAX: I didn't say<br />to come through the window.
536240 537760 This is Max. We used to work together.
537880 539016 - His wife, Annie. Michelle.<br />- Hey!
539040 540040 And that guy, Kevin.
540120 541216 - What's up, buddy?<br />- The door was right there.
541240 542275 Guys, this is Madison.
542360 543713 Yeah, you brought her last week.
543880 545757 You work at Forever 21, right?
545920 547956 - MAX: No, no.<br />- I work at Sephora.
548040 550395 - I'm confused.<br />- Different girl.
550560 551879 Same look, same voice.
552040 553109 Nice to meet you.
553320 554840 - You, too.<br />- (MADISON AND MAX CHUCKLE)
557080 558559 - That's yours.<br />- It's...
558720 560711 No. I think you're<br />supposed to kiss it, right?
560880 561915 Welcome.
562040 563473 Do you guys have a bathroom?
563640 565016 There's one just down the hall.<br />You need it?
565040 568191 Okay, is it on the right or the left?<br />I don't wanna go in the wrong room.
568360 569509 The one with the toilet.
569680 570749 - Can't miss it.<br />- Okay.
570880 572438 (BOTH LAUGH)
573560 574993 - Oh, boy.<br />- Dude!
575160 577196 - Wow. Where'd you find her? TED Talk?<br />- Right?
577360 578634 No, at Chipotle.
578800 579856 Let me ask you something, Ryan.
579880 581576 Aren't you sick of<br />losing game night every week
581600 582776 because of the dates you bring?
582800 584711 They're not always that bad.
585040 586712 (IMITATES VELOCIRAPTOR)
587880 588915 Heather, seriously.
589000 591160 How many photos of you<br />with the dog filter do you need?
592880 595030 Uh... "Dennis" isn't a word.
595240 597800 Uh, yeah, it is.<br />It's my daddy's name, so...
597960 600713 These are the elite,<br />the very best, the...
600800 601869 Oh, oh! White people!
601960 603552 - What?<br />- Oh, Jesus.
603640 604834 Okay, unlike you psychos,
605040 606800 I don't give a shit<br />about winning game night.
607000 608479 I don't need that validation.
608640 610921 But you do need the validation<br />of dating Instagram models?
611040 612075 Absolutely.
612240 614549 I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br />I'm not like you, Michelle.
614720 617188 We didn't all meet our soul mate<br />when we were 10 years old.
617280 618280 14.
618360 619360 - Oh, sorry.<br />- 14.
619440 621160 And we didn't get married<br />until we were 19.
621240 622992 - See, that's gross.<br />- You know what, Ryan?
623080 625275 I hope one day you<br />get to meet a lovely, young lady.
625440 627896 So you can love her as much as<br />I love my sweet baby right here.
627920 629717 Yes, find her. Look how cute this...
629880 631176 - Hey, look at this.<br />- So much love.
631200 632256 Let's look at him when we do it.
632280 633776 - Hey, everybody, grab your drinks.<br />- MICHELLE: Find the love!
633800 635028 Let's go play, come on.
635200 638476 Dude, do you know what rich people are<br />doing on their game nights these days?
638640 639959 What's that?
640160 641440 - (WHISPERS) Fight clubs.<br />- What?
641520 642669 I just read about them.
642840 644910 They pay poor people<br />to fight each other,
645040 646216 and then they bet on the winner.
646240 647960 - No, that's not a real thing.<br />- Yes, it is!
648080 649816 If you can have anything<br />you want in this world,
649840 651956 you have to raise the stakes,<br />or life gets boring.
652120 654320 The Kennedys used to have fight clubs<br />at their compound.
654400 657336 Honey, listen, you gotta stop reading<br />BuzzFeed every second of the damn day.
657360 659056 How about some charades?<br />Huh, should we start with charades?
659080 660136 - RYAN: Let's go!<br />- MICHELLE: Yeah!
660160 661309 It's been a while, huh?
661480 662879 Do you wanna wait for Brooks?
663040 664256 I don't think we need to. No, he's late.
664280 666555 - Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?<br />- MAX: Yeah.
666720 667936 I thought he was working in Europe.
667960 670315 He was, yeah. He's apparently back<br />for some business.
670520 671520 Haven't seen him yet.
671680 673830 - But we can get started.<br />- Yeah!
674000 676096 - MAX: Who wants to start?<br />- Who are you guys talking about?
676120 678759 Max's brother. He's this super<br />successful venture capitalist.
678920 681480 Yeah, he was the first to invest<br />in Panera Bread, you know?
681640 683358 The Fuji Apple Salad was his idea.
683520 684920 - A lot of investors.<br />- KEVIN: Yeah.
685120 686840 He's like the Mark Wahlberg<br />to Max's Donnie.
686880 687915 Well...
688040 689109 Which is a huge compliment
689200 691714 because Donnie was fucking great<br />in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?
691800 692915 He was.
693000 694399 Was he in The Sixth Sense?
694560 696800 He sure is, yeah.<br />You know who is not in The Sixth Sense?
696880 697995 Mark Wahlberg.
698160 700594 Mark would never take a role that small.
702280 704396 Is that right, Madison?
704560 705976 Man, I haven't seen him<br />since the wedding.
706000 707991 - Remember that speech he gave?<br />- Yes.
708160 709736 And then he paid<br />for that whole firework display!
709760 711016 - Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!<br />- Little over the top.
711040 712680 Let's get started.<br />I'm gonna start us off.
712720 714216 - Yes, let's start!<br />- Here we go. Let's do it.
714240 716016 - We gotta pick teams first.<br />- (CAR HORN HONKING)
716040 717136 - ANNIE: Movie?<br />- MICHELLE: It's a movie. Okay.
717160 718936 - RYAN: Dude, we have no teams.<br />- KEVIN: You just give up?

737080 738479 I did, yeah, like, three times.

741560 743790 He got a Stingray, huh?

752840 754319 Hello, again.
754720 755835 Mmm...
755920 757672 Still wearing the uniform.
759080 760433 Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.
760600 762591 I hope you didn't start<br />game night without me.
762680 764033 (MAX SHUSHING)
764560 765709 Did you not get my text?
765880 767313 What text?
767760 769079 Oh, hello, Officer.
770920 772592 Why's that guy staring at us?
772760 774480 Gary, I want you<br />to meet my brother, Brooks.
774600 778070 We're having a little family<br />three-man game night tonight.
778240 779560 Wait, what do you mean three-man?
779640 781296 You said that Michelle<br />and Ryan and Kevin were...
781320 782799 No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.
782960 784160 I can see them in the doorway.
784240 786117 - There's a whole mess of people.<br />- Hey, guys!
786280 787713 - MAX: There they are.<br />- RYAN: Hey!
787880 789154 These guys are leaving.
789240 790240 Take off, guys.
790320 792550 We had a little bit<br />of a mix-up with the, um...
793600 794874 - God damn it!<br />- What?
795040 796896 We didn't want him to know<br />that we're having a game night.
796920 800310 He used to come, and we don't<br />like him anymore, so...
800400 801628 Oh.
802040 803359 You know, I think he knows now.
803520 804669 He sure does.
804840 808276 Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.
808760 811513 (LAUGHS) I haven't seen you in a year!
811680 814638 Hey, you smell good.
814800 817997 What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?<br />Head and Shoulders?
818160 819800 Why do you assume<br />it's a dandruff shampoo?
819960 822336 Well, I mean, you've always<br />been a little bit of a snowstorm.
822360 823816 - Hey, would you hold that for a second?<br />- Yup.
823840 824909 Hey, guys!
825080 827594 Well, you look good, stranger.
827800 828800 It's been forever.
828960 830632 I know, and that's my fault.<br />I'm so sorry.
830960 832188 Sweet ride, Brooks.
832360 834296 Oh, you like that?<br />I just got her a couple weeks ago.
834320 835469 What is that? A Corvette?
835640 838552 It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.
838720 839914 It was my dream car as a kid.
840080 841991 And that's what<br />gave me the idea to get it.
842080 843957 You know what? I love your house.
845000 846115 Are you being sarcastic?
846320 847480 No, I mean I love your house.
847560 849198 It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.
849360 850793 Makes me think of simpler times.
850960 852313 "Simpler"?
852480 854391 Uh, so, how long are you in town for?
854480 855549 You know, I'm not sure.
855720 857119 It depends on how many clients
857200 859256 the firm's gonna be<br />having me schmooze while I'm here.
859280 860315 (BOTH LAUGHING)
860400 861440 But hopefully for a while.
861520 863829 I don't get to see you guys, and I...
865600 868160 God, I really miss you, man.<br />I really do.
868240 869832 - Oh.<br />- (BROOKS SIGHS)
870440 871919 Miss you, too, Brooks.
872280 873349 RYAN: And go!
874160 875832 Shock-rocker. Dated Rose McGowan.
875920 877353 Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.
877560 878629 Yep. You got it.
878720 880631 - Quick story.<br />- There's no pausing.
880800 883496 You remember the urban myth where<br />Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out
883520 884760 so he could go down on himself?
884920 885955 ALL: Yeah.
886040 887456 You don't mind me telling the story,<br />do you, Max?
887480 888600 You're in the middle of a...
888640 890835 You were 14 years old.<br />It's an adorable story.
891000 892000 I forbid it.
892200 894350 I'm a little curious.
894520 896317 Did you blow yourself?
896600 898176 You know the bungee cords on roof racks?
898200 899200 Yeah.
899280 902317 Max took one of those bungee cords,<br />and he put it around his neck.
902480 903480 Here he goes.
903560 904936 And then he wrapped it behind his legs
904960 907235 so he could squish his face<br />down into his crotch,
907400 908913 - (ALL GASP)<br />- but the problem was
909080 911674 that it got stuck!<br />He couldn't unhook it.
912560 914630 - (ALL LAUGHING)<br />- And about an hour later
914800 917075 Mom comes home, and she finds him there.
917240 918275 KEVIN: Shit!
918440 920400 Her little pretzel boy<br />on his bedroom floor naked.
920960 922680 - (LAUGHING CONTINUES)<br />- Little pretzel boy?
922720 924597 Great story. Are we back on now?
924760 926034 So?
926360 927360 "So" what?
927520 928635 Did you suck it?
929000 930416 - (ALL LAUGHING)<br />- Let's go. Come on. Brooks.
930440 931840 Back to it. Come on. Play the game.
932600 934397 Poor man's Johnny Depp,<br />starred in Jericho.
934560 935913 Skeet Ulrich.
936440 938829 UN Secretary General '92 to '96.
939040 940080 Oh, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
940520 943318 This guy. He hated kids<br />in Jurassic Park.
943480 944480 Uh, Sam Neill.
944640 946392 Dubstep DJ, looks like Corey Feldman.
946480 947480 - Skrillex.<br />- BROOKS: Yep.
947560 949630 - Rappers love this Cubist painter.<br />- Picasso!
949840 952160 - Big cat shot by asshole dentist.<br />- KEVIN: Cecil the lion!
952280 953633 - Time!<br />- (GRUNTS)
953720 954789 - How many?<br />- KEVIN: Seven!
954880 955915 Seven!
956000 957194 (CHEERING)
958440 959668 You're up, pretzel boy.
959840 960840 ANNIE: Whoo! Go, Max!
961080 962991 - Come on, Max.<br />- All right. Here we go.
963160 964957 RYAN: And kick it. Go!
966720 967720 Oh, this is easy!
967800 971349 Annie, the famous actor that we met<br />at the airport about eight years ago.
972760 973760 Who?
973920 976000 Only actor we've ever met<br />at an airport who's famous.
976440 977555 Bobby Flay?
977720 980678 Not an actor. This fellow was<br />in front of us at the Sbarro.
980840 983121 We were wondering why he<br />wasn't in the first-class lounge.
983280 984838 Oh, yes, yes.
985360 986360 Who was that?
986520 987555 God damn it!
987640 989176 Max, there's a whole room of people<br />to help you out here.
989200 990269 - Use us.<br />- Good point.
990800 992400 (STAMMERING) He was the Incredible Hulk.
992560 993595 BOTH: Eric Bana.
993800 995711 - Other one.<br />- MICHELLE: Um, Mark Ruffalo.
995880 997240 - Other one.<br />- KEVIN: Lou Ferrigno.
997360 999351 Holy shit! Primal Fear.
999560 1001360 Richard Gere never played<br />the Incredible Hulk.
1001440 1003351 - Time.<br />- Motherfucking Ed Norton!
1003480 1004629 ALL: Oh!
1004720 1005755 Primal Fear!
1005920 1007069 Oh, my God!
1007240 1008240 RYAN: He was the Hulk.
1008360 1009918 - KEVIN: The Hulk.<br />- RYAN: I forgot that.
1010000 1011797 Max. Zero points.
1011960 1014793 I'd say he blew it,<br />but he won't tell us, will he?
1015000 1016353 (ALL LAUGHING)
1017440 1019192 RYAN: Shit! Did you?
1019360 1021396 I can't believe I didn't get Bob Barker.
1021560 1024632 Hey, guys! What do you say<br />we do this at my house next week?
1025040 1026256 - House? What house?<br />- Ooh. Really?
1026280 1028800 Since I don't know how long<br />I'm gonna be here, I rented a place.
1028960 1030359 It's only a couple miles away.
1030520 1031873 You know, it's up on Broadmoor.
1032040 1033473 Oh! Swanky neighborhood.
1033640 1036200 It's a very cool house,<br />but it's just me there alone.
1036360 1038271 It'd be great<br />to have you guys come over.
1038440 1042069 Oh, well, it's kind of a tradition<br />to have game nights here.
1042240 1043434 But you know what?
1043640 1045551 Let's let him show off<br />his big house, huh?
1045720 1046994 BROOKS: That's the spirit!
1047160 1048434 Trust me.
1049840 1053389 This will be a game night to remember.
1054080 1055274 - Oh, boy.<br />- Mmm.
1055360 1056395 Promise?
1056480 1058536 Good night, everybody.<br />I love you much. Drive safely.
1058560 1059675 - Kisses!<br />- All right.
1059840 1061398 - KEVIN: Take it easy.<br />- ALL: Bye.
1061560 1064199 That little motherfucker.
1064560 1065675 Whoa!
1065760 1067955 Well, I mean, come on.
1068120 1070111 We don't see him in over a year.
1070280 1072840 He shows up in your dream car,
1073000 1075878 insults our house, and then tells<br />an embarrassing story about you
1076040 1078200 right before your turn<br />just to throw you off your game.
1078320 1081040 Welcome to my whole life. Why are you<br />suddenly so worked up about it?
1081200 1082920 Well, cause now<br />he's messing with your balls
1083080 1085036 and literally killing<br />millions of our babies.
1085200 1086838 Well, that's a little dramatic,
1087000 1088956 but, yeah, you know,<br />I mean, that's Brooks.
1089120 1091280 I thought that this<br />was just regular old brother stuff,
1091360 1092656 - but I totally see it now.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1092680 1094591 He undermines you every chance he gets.
1094680 1095795 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1095880 1097757 - It's crazy!<br />- Thank you, Annie.
1097920 1100036 You know, I've never won<br />a single game against him.
1100240 1101240 I just...
1101320 1103914 I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.
1105200 1106394 - Fix it?<br />- Yeah.
1106560 1107560 What are you suggesting?
1107720 1109790 I'm suggesting we beat his ass.
1110000 1111797 Jesus Christ.
1113200 1114952 Good evening.
1115120 1117031 - We're gonna skip the cleanup?<br />- (CHUCKLES)
1122440 1124158 Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?
1124320 1126038 No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.
1126200 1127536 - I'm gonna stay alert and ready.<br />- GARY: Evening!
1127560 1128720 - Jesus, Gary!<br />- (ANNIE GASPS)
1129760 1130909 Where are you headed?
1131080 1133719 We are going to, uh, to my brother's.
1134080 1136196 Another game night?
1136400 1138709 No. No, absolutely not.
1138880 1140472 We're going to, um,
1141400 1142435 have some dinner.
1142600 1143635 Eat.
1143760 1145193 I see.
1145520 1149229 Pity. I was going to invite you<br />over for a dinner I'm hosting.
1150080 1152913 I've purchased four lamb shanks
1153080 1157915 that I've been simmering<br />in a broth of red wine and rosemary.
1158280 1159952 That sounds so yummy, though.
1160040 1161040 Damn it.
1161120 1163315 It was actually Debbie's recipe.
1164800 1170636 I like to think she left behind her<br />recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,
1172560 1176030 but it was most likely<br />an unintentional oversight.
1181360 1184238 Well, here we go.
1185600 1186874 GARY: What?
1187960 1189154 I'm sorry?
1190240 1192037 I thought you said something.
1192320 1194117 - No.<br />- Nope, not us.
1194560 1195595 Okay.
1198520 1200158 - (CAR ENGINE STARTS)<br />- Have fun.
1203680 1205238 MAX: Oh, fuck me.
1206160 1207957 A guy who rents a house this big
1208120 1211237 must be making up for something<br />pretty small, I'd say.
1211400 1213789 No, no. No, I've seen his dick.<br />It's pretty great.
1213960 1215757 Well, I tried.
1217200 1218474 - Hey!<br />- MAX: Hey!
1218640 1219896 - ANNIE: Hey!<br />- How are you doing, beautiful?
1219920 1222354 - Good, good. Really fancy.<br />- Very nice house, Tony Stark.
1222520 1224600 Should we give<br />our drink orders to Jarvis? (CHUCKLES)
1225040 1227793 No, I got the Tony Stark part,<br />but then you went full nerd on me.
1227960 1229536 I kind of lost you,<br />but please do come in.
1229560 1230560 All right.
1230640 1231709 - Thanks, Cap.<br />- Hi, guys!
1231800 1232800 ALL: What's up?
1232880 1236350 Boy, could sleep four<br />on that couch. Look at that.
1236440 1238158 Oh, hello, friends.
1238320 1241835 Hey, let me introduce you to my date.<br />This is Sarah.
1242000 1243991 Sarah is head of company accounting<br />at our office.
1244160 1245400 Well, corporate communications.
1245480 1248392 And she's also British,<br />which means she's smart as shit.
1248600 1250272 - I'm Irish.<br />- Okay? Same island.
1250440 1251555 Well, it's really not.
1251640 1252776 - Nice to meet you. Hi.<br />- Nice to meet you, too.
1252800 1253915 - I'm Max.<br />- Annie.
1254000 1256992 So, you can't always judge a book<br />by its past covers, can you?
1257160 1259196 - ANNIE: Mmm.<br />- Almost a saying.
1259400 1260520 - Here you go.<br />- Hey, Brooks.
1260640 1262136 - Cheers.<br />- We didn't know if you had any games,
1262160 1264390 so we thought we'd bring you<br />a few of our favorites.
1264560 1266073 Hey, look at that.
1266520 1268112 - (CLATTERS)<br />- ALL: Whoa!
1268200 1269560 - MAX: Huh.<br />- MICHELLE: The poor games.
1269600 1271511 I told you we're taking it up a notch.
1271680 1274638 The game that we're<br />gonna play tonight is so epic
1274800 1277155 that we don't need a board,<br />and we do not need pieces.
1277320 1279016 Still didn't need to throw them<br />across the room.
1279040 1280268 I was being theatrical.
1280440 1282192 Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?
1282360 1283395 A what?
1283480 1285496 It's when rich people<br />pay poor people to fight each other...
1285520 1288016 Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.<br />Stop with the fight club, okay?
1288040 1289314 - It's nonsense.<br />- No.
1289480 1290879 Ryan believes everything he reads.
1291040 1292553 Thank you.
1292720 1294995 So, what are we playing?
1297520 1302150 In the next hour, someone in this room<br />is going to be taken.
1302360 1305318 And it's gonna be up to you to find them<br />before they are murdered.
1305480 1307436 Oh! It's a murder mystery party.
1307600 1309352 BROOKS: Not just any murder mystery.
1309520 1311056 I found this company.<br />They do it super real.
1311080 1312149 They use legit actors.
1312240 1315312 You're not gonna know<br />what's real and what's fake.
1315480 1317675 - Fun!<br />- But that's not all
1317840 1321992 because whoever finds the victim<br />wins the grand prize.
1323800 1325392 The keys to the Stingray.
1325560 1327152 - What?<br />- Wow.
1327320 1328958 Just the keys?
1329640 1331073 No, Ryan, the whole car.
1331240 1333356 Oh, yes! Oh, man!
1333560 1335176 You're so lucky I brought you<br />to this game night
1335200 1337270 - and not one of Max and Annie's.<br />- Hey!
1337480 1340040 - No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.<br />- Oh.
1340240 1342515 You're not gonna actually<br />give away your car?
1342680 1344113 Oh, it's just a tax write-off.
1344320 1346629 And the Audi, it's more practical.
1347080 1348513 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
1348680 1350750 Okay. How do we start?
1350920 1352672 We just wait for it to begin.
1352840 1355354 Maybe play a drinking game<br />to pass the time?
1355520 1357476 This group does not play drinking games.
1357640 1359676 Tonight we do, Max.
1360600 1362136 - Oh! "Never Have I Ever."<br />- RYAN: Good one!
1362160 1363560 (QUIETLY) Can you believe this guy?
1363600 1365511 (QUIETLY) Yeah, he's ridiculous.
1365680 1367159 Beautiful house, though.
1367320 1368912 Good champagne.
1372920 1374672 Here we go.
1376080 1378355 Yup. We're at the house.
1378800 1381234 We'll let you know when we have him.

1396880 1398711 (GASPS) Jesus Christ!
1398880 1400598 What's with that knife?
1400800 1402392 It's for the cheese.
1402560 1405120 Okay, all right. Just, you know,
1405280 1407589 really aggressive way to carry a knife.
1408440 1409440 Oh, no, I've got one.
1409600 1413115 Never have I ever<br />connected my work computer
1413280 1416670 to the projector in the conference room<br />when it was open on a WebMD page
1416840 1417909 for chlamydia symptoms.
1418080 1419115 RYAN: That's not cool!
1419280 1420395 SARAH: Drink!
1420560 1422437 Just for the record,<br />I did not have chlamydia.
1422600 1425433 It was pubic dermatitis. You get it<br />from not washing your crotch, so...
1425600 1426776 - ANNIE: Okay.<br />- MAX: Good for you.
1426800 1428870 I... I like her.
1429280 1431296 And, listen, you're not supposed<br />to single people out in this game.
1431320 1433470 It's supposed to be generic things, like
1433640 1435392 "Never have I ever slept<br />with a celebrity."
1435560 1437391 Oh, I didn't know. Okay.
1437480 1438595 BROOKS: Whoops.
1438680 1439749 - SARAH: Mmm?<br />- Ooh.
1439840 1441114 (KEVIN CHUCKLES)
1442960 1443995 What?
1444080 1445877 You slept with a celebrity?
1446040 1448634 No, I was taking a drink<br />separate from the game.
1448720 1449856 - That was bad timing.<br />- MAX: Mmm.
1449880 1451480 I see how you would think, but it's not.
1451600 1454361 Well, then why are you breathing<br />like you just got off the elliptical?
1454800 1456472 I'm not. I'm...
1456920 1459195 (SCOFFS) Come on, babe.<br />Whose turn is it?
1459320 1461629 Uh, it's Max. Max, it's your turn. Huh?
1461800 1463677 I'm not playing a drinking game.<br />Who was it?
1463840 1464880 What's the deal with that?
1464920 1466096 They've been together<br />since middle school.
1466120 1467176 MICHELLE: It's somebody else's turn.
1467200 1468200 - Oh. Oh!<br />- Yeah!
1468320 1470336 How could you possibly<br />have had sex with a celebrity
1470360 1472237 when we've only had sex with each other?
1472400 1474656 Please, can you not make this<br />one of your things right now?
1474680 1475840 How is this one of my things?
1476640 1479518 Yeah, Brooks, this is why<br />we don't play drinking games.
1479600 1480600 (POUNDING ON DOOR)
1482640 1484392 It looks like the game is afoot.
1484480 1485754 Oh!
1485880 1487359 - Thank you, God!<br />- (SCOFFS)
1487520 1489476 MAX: Oh, boy. Let's buckle up, huh?
1491680 1493193 Brooks Davis?
1493480 1494515 Yes.
1494600 1496192 - Oh, shit.<br />- ALL: Ooh!

1505200 1506269 Sit down, please.
1507520 1509033 I'll get right to the point.
1509200 1513955 The Bureau has been tracking a ring<br />of violent kidnappers
1514120 1516236 in this very neighborhood.
1516960 1520316 And we have reason to believe<br />that one of you
1521600 1523113 may be their next victim.
1523200 1524428 (RYAN LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)
1525120 1526336 - (CHUCKLES)<br />- MAX: That's terrible news.
1526360 1529636 Contained within these dossiers
1529840 1533435 are the clues you will require<br />to find the kidnappers.
1533600 1535556 You'd like for us to do that, yeah?
1536120 1538040 The Bureau's...<br />What's the Bureau's role in this?
1538120 1540016 Maybe you guys could take my wife<br />in for questioning
1540040 1541776 because, apparently, she got a<br />secret life I don't know nothing about.
1541800 1544075 - Baby, this is...<br />- Shut up, all of you!
1544160 1545309 Wow.
1546880 1548598 It's not a joke.
1548760 1551479 You people are in real danger,<br />and you're running out of time.
1551640 1555394 And I, Agent Henderson,<br />will not stand idly by
1555560 1559678 while innocent civilians<br />are slaughtered on my watch.
1559840 1561096 (LAUGHING) I told you<br />this is gonna be great.
1561120 1562951 - It's so good!<br />- So good.
1563160 1564296 But, uh, before we get started,
1564320 1566601 I'm required to ask if any of you<br />have any food allergies.
1567040 1568075 Peanuts?
1569080 1570229 Who the hell are you?
1570320 1571389 - (GROANS)<br />- Oh!
1571480 1573216 Now wait a second.<br />I know you're method and all,
1573240 1575536 but you can't just come in here<br />and break the door. (GROANS)
1575560 1577596 - (GUESTS EXCLAIM)<br />- I do not mind this game.
1577800 1579358 - Are you crazy?<br />- (GRUNTS)
1580800 1583109 (BOTH GRUNTING)
1594360 1596112 It's very well done.
1597400 1598549 No!

1602000 1603433 Oh, watch out! He's packing heat!

1680360 1681360 Bye-bye!
1681520 1683078 First one that follows us gets shot!
1683280 1684918 Okay, roger that. You drive safe.
1685120 1686712 KIDNAPPER: Come on, motherfucker!
1687120 1689270 - That was amazing.<br />- Really good.
1689440 1690759 - That was really good.<br />- Wow.
1691040 1695033 Mmm. No, there's something about this<br />that just doesn't feel right.
1695560 1697835 How could you cheat on me<br />with a celebrity?
1698000 1699035 I didn't cheat on you.
1699200 1701714 It was before we got married<br />when we took that break.
1701880 1704110 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1704280 1705416 I've been living in The Matrix.
1705440 1708432 Agent Henderson,<br />you just gonna keep lying there?
1708640 1709720 KEVIN: Is any of this real?
1709800 1711392 Well, don't kick him!
1712000 1714040 - MICHELLE: Stop.<br />- He's a regular Daniel Day-Lewis.
1714160 1715256 KEVIN: I thought we both agreed
1715280 1718158 that we wouldn't hook up<br />with anybody else during that break.
1718360 1720760 Yeah, but then you went<br />and got a hand job from Karen Waller.
1720840 1722656 - KEVIN: No, don't do that.<br />- RYAN: Boop! Boop! Boop!
1722680 1724557 Because it was over the pants,<br />all right?
1724720 1728076 It was, and it hurt. It was very dry,<br />and I didn't climax.
1728240 1729896 Just admit it.<br />You guys did more than that.
1729920 1731831 Don't turn this around on me.<br />Do not do that.
1732040 1733200 Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!
1733520 1734576 Damn it, they got the jump on us.
1734600 1735600 - Come on.<br />- Shit, Kev!
1735680 1736680 Come on now!
1736760 1738576 All right. Here's the first clue.<br />Looks like a riddle.
1738600 1740079 "With shiny fangs..."
1740240 1741878 "My bloodless bite..."
1742040 1744838 "Will bring together<br />what's mostly white."
1745000 1746797 Donald Trump.
1746960 1750748 "Bloodless bite." It's not a vampire.<br />Um...
1750920 1752239 I'll just Google it.
1752400 1753640 It's so inconsistent, isn't it?
1753680 1755480 I mean, they stage<br />this super realistic fight.
1755600 1758433 They give us an FBI dossier<br />but with riddles.
1758600 1760536 It's like, let's pick a tone.<br />Let's stick with it.
1760560 1762456 But that's the game.<br />You wanna win this car or not?
1762480 1763879 Yeah, yeah. More than anything,
1764040 1765640 but I feel like Brooks is setting me up.
1765720 1767080 Do you get that feeling? You know,
1767240 1770710 that this is some game<br />where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?
1772480 1773913 Mmm-hmm.
1774800 1776950 Well, let's not play by his rules.
1778360 1780016 "My bloodless bite, my bloodless,<br />bloodless bite.
1780040 1781996 "Bloodless bite, bloodless bite,<br />bloodless bite."
1782160 1784390 Can you stop chanting "bloodless bite"?<br />It's just...
1784960 1786951 - Trying to think.<br />- Yeah.
1787480 1789994 - (CAR ENGINE STARTS)<br />- Oh, shit!
1790520 1792670 Max and Annie must have figured it out.
1792840 1795035 Right. We need to find an advantage.
1795400 1798836 Advantage, advantage, advantage...
1799120 1800120 Brooks' wallet?
1800280 1802430 You think we should steal<br />all of his shit!
1803000 1804000 No.
1805040 1806234 (DIALING CELL PHONE)
1808480 1810471 Hi, yeah. I lost my credit card.
1810560 1812496 I was wondering if you could tell me<br />what the last few charges I made were.
1812520 1813589 What are you doing?
1813760 1815496 If we can find out the name<br />of the murder mystery place he used,
1815520 1817736 we can go to their office and<br />pay them off to give us the final clue.
1817760 1819159 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1819320 1823438 You're, like, a double threat.<br />Brains and you're British.
1824440 1825589 Thanks.
1825800 1831193 Okay. What has shiny fangs<br />that bites white things together?
1831360 1832360 A stapler!
1832520 1834511 And the white things are paper.
1834680 1837592 Yes! You are so smart and unfaithful!
1837840 1838875 Oh, there it is.
1839040 1840155 Yes!
1841280 1842998 Look at that.
1843160 1844957 - Flash drive.<br />- Put it in the desktop.
1847280 1848280 Okay.
1849120 1850189 KEVIN: Another riddle.
1850360 1853557 "I'm brown and old by day,<br />white and young by night.
1853720 1854720 "My eyes are glass.
1854880 1856757 "I have nine faces but no head.
1856920 1858638 "I sing to the sky but have no voice.
1858800 1861394 "I'm everywhere and nowhere."
1863120 1864997 What the fuck is that?
1865080 1866274 (MAX LAUGHS)
1866360 1867679 I mean, how cool are we?
1867880 1869336 - Very, very cool. We are very cool.<br />- Right?
1869360 1872716 You're the cool one. You know,<br />tracking the phone is just a great idea.
1872880 1874154 Still on Route 18, huh?
1874320 1876480 MAX: We're catching up to them.<br />Here we come, Brooksie.
1876520 1879193 Can you imagine the look on his face<br />when we find him so fast?
1879360 1882750 You know, baby, I can feel my sperm<br />already coming back to life.
1882920 1884069 - Perfect.<br />- Yeah.
1884240 1887391 So we'll win your brother's car,<br />and then we'll go make a baby in it.
1887560 1889471 - Yeah! We'll make him watch us. Huh?<br />- Yeah.
1890440 1892351 - I don't wanna do that.<br />- No, me neither.
1892520 1893896 - Sorry, don't know why I said that.<br />- I'm not into that.
1893920 1895478 - Not a great idea.<br />- Okay.
1895640 1896868 Okay, great. Thank you.
1897080 1898456 All right, I got the name<br />and the address of the games company.
1898480 1899674 - Let's go.<br />- Yes!
1899840 1902752 All we have to do now,<br />figure out what "bloodless bite" means.
1903320 1904548 No, we don't. That's why...
1906040 1908474 - Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.<br />- Doesn't matter. Let's go.
1908640 1910198 How you gonna be old and young?
1910360 1912112 - That doesn't make sense.<br />- I know.
1912280 1914794 Guys, hey, how's it goin'?
1914960 1918077 I just wanted to wish you<br />the best of luck tonight. Bye.
1921040 1922234 - BOTH: No.<br />- KEVIN: Mmm-mmm.
1922440 1923759 What are... What are you doing?
1923920 1925353 Just being a dick.
1925480 1927710 - (BANGING ON DOOR)<br />- KEVIN: Oh!
1927800 1929896 - SARAH: Don't kick him, Ryan!<br />- He's such a good actor!
1929920 1930955 KEVIN: Ryan!
1931040 1933429 God damn it!
1934560 1937000 Baby, hand me those matches.<br />I'm about to burn this door down.
1937160 1939696 You're gonna light a fire in<br />a windowless room that we're trapped in?
1939720 1942336 You slept with Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br />He talked to you about flames?
1942360 1943429 What about that?
1957840 1959637 Where could he be?
1960040 1962508 His phone stopped right here, huh?
1962600 1964636 (CELL PHONE RINGING)
1964960 1966188 - Hear that?<br />- Yeah.
1967000 1968000 (GASPS)
1968080 1969149 Ugh.
1969400 1970469 Found it!
1970640 1972160 He must've known we were tracking him.
1972280 1973793 Well, they outsmarted us.
1975800 1976800 Hang on.
1977400 1978594 (ANNIE GASPS)
1978720 1980358 Isn't that one of the actors?
1980760 1982830 MAX: Guess they're not<br />so smart after all, huh?
1983040 1985918 Guess not. We are nailing this!
1987120 1988296 (WHISPERS) Why are we crouching?
1988320 1990515 (WHISPERS) I don't know. It feels right.
1994280 1995952 Oh, it's horrible in here.
1996120 1998839 - Yeah, it's sticky. Shoes are shot.<br />- Ugh.
1999480 2001376 Ooh. There he is. There he is.<br />Don't let him see you. Come on.
2001400 2002719 Sit down right here.
2002880 2005155 Bartender, sir,<br />can I ask you a question?
2005240 2006309 Um...
2006560 2007675 You, um...
2007760 2009955 You didn't happen to see a fellow<br />brought in here,
2010120 2011348 looks a little bit like me,
2011520 2013750 but he's got a little bit<br />of a sharper chin
2013920 2015194 and higher cheekbones?
2015360 2017032 So a better-looking guy?
2017400 2019231 No, well, I wouldn't call it that.
2019480 2020959 I didn't see nothing.
2022440 2024158 - Oh, boy. You hear that?<br />- Huh. Yeah.
2024320 2025696 That double negative?<br />"Didn't see nothing"?
2025720 2027496 - It's a little forced, right?<br />- Yeah, I think he's in on it.
2027520 2028936 - 'Course he is.<br />- Look at those tats.
2028960 2030678 So fresh, probably fake.
2031240 2033435 Tell you what.<br />Let's give him a test, okay?
2033600 2036376 Let's order a couple of drinks that only<br />a real bartender would know how to make.
2036400 2037435 Oh, smart! Yes.
2037520 2038953 - Sir! Excuse me. Hi.<br />- Barkeep.
2039120 2040560 MAX: Totally forgot to order drinks.
2040680 2041795 Yes, uh...
2042400 2045198 Could I please have a vodka tonic?
2047000 2048035 Well done, honey.
2048200 2050475 I'm gonna have a Harvey Wallbanger.
2050640 2052596 Okay? Appreciate it.
2053200 2054758 Jesus! Did you see that look?
2054920 2056096 Guy doesn't know what's going on.
2056120 2057189 Think you stumped him.
2057360 2059237 Regional theater hack.
2059320 2060719 - (LAUGHS)<br />- Huh?
2061200 2063634 - Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?<br />- Yeah.
2063800 2064976 It's nice to get out of the house.
2065000 2067840 You know, we're not gonna be able<br />to do stuff like this if we have kids.
2067880 2068949 - What?<br />- Yeah.
2069040 2070280 - Why not?<br />- Well, I don't know.
2070400 2072016 I was thinking about it.<br />Remember Dan and Linda?
2072040 2074000 Remember how much time<br />we used to spend with them?
2074160 2076958 Just tons of fun.<br />And then they had those twins.
2077120 2078473 Boom! Off the grid, right?
2078680 2080750 Last time we saw them<br />was their Christmas card
2080840 2081880 with the wonky kids on it.
2082000 2084798 Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.<br />They look so happy.
2084880 2086074 But you know what I mean.
2087120 2089000 - We don't see them...<br />- BARTENDER: Vodka tonic.
2089240 2090719 Harvey Wallbanger.
2090880 2092000 - Appreciate it.<br />- Thank you.
2092160 2093639 Cheers.
2096520 2097589 Did he get it right?
2097920 2100136 Huh. I do not know. I realized I've<br />never had one of these,
2100160 2102390 but that is a tasty drink.<br />It's kind of tart.
2102560 2104391 You wanna try it? Oh! Honey!
2104560 2105754 Honey! There's Brooks!
2105920 2108388 Brooks is here. Brooks is here.<br />We're about to win this thing!
2108560 2110710 - Yes, yes!<br />- Look who came in here.
2110920 2113229 Oh! No! I think he made us.
2113400 2115136 So what? It's over.<br />What, are they gonna try to stop us?
2115160 2116479 - Let's go.<br />- Yeah, probably.
2116640 2119518 But that's why I brought this.
2119720 2121336 Jesus Christ, honey!<br />Where did you get a gun?
2121360 2123590 No, no, that's the fake gun<br />from Brooks' fight.
2123760 2126115 - Oh, yeah. Boy, that looks real.<br />- Yeah, well, you know...
2126200 2127736 - Brooks never spares any expense.<br />- Look at that.
2127760 2130149 - Yeah, that's true.<br />- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?
2130320 2131355 Why? What are you doing?
2131480 2132480 Lead?
2132560 2134676 Any of you fucking pricks move,

2144840 2147016 Well, you're gonna hand over the keys<br />'cause we're gonna take my brother.
2147040 2148075 Bullshit.
2148160 2151311 Oh! You know what's bullshit<br />is your bald, ugly face.
2151400 2153896 Uh-uh. No, that's personal.<br />Come on, honey, let's just keep it fun.

2165360 2167096 - Hands up! That's right.<br />- MAX: There we go.
2167120 2168880 - All right, hands in the air!<br />- Get them up!
2169040 2170393 - Yep.<br />- Yo, where's my head go?
2170600 2171828 - Down.<br />- On the floor.
2172000 2173115 Just rest it.
2173200 2174496 How am I supposed<br />to put my hands in the air
2174520 2175856 - with my head on the ground?<br />- Fucking exactly.

2187560 2189376 - ANNIE: All right. Arms out.<br />- Here she comes.
2189400 2191118 Knees apart if you have back problems.
2191200 2192360 And if you're doing it right,
2192440 2195352 you're really gonna feel that<br />lumbar opening up back there.
2195440 2196536 MAX: Let's put your head down.
2196560 2199438 Come on. I don't wanna have to use this.<br />Okay? (CHUCKLES)
2199680 2201113 - (GRUNTS)<br />- Okay.
2201720 2203153 Can't you just tell me who it was?
2203240 2206277 I know you, Kev. If I tell you,<br />you'll just obsess about it even more.
2206360 2207873 Okay, fine. How about this?
2207960 2209871 If I guess it right, you tell me.
2209960 2211029 Fine.
2211120 2212120 Was it an actor?
2212280 2213429 Yes. That tower is unstable.
2213600 2215636 I'm not stable! Was he over 40?
2215800 2216800 Yes. Be careful.
2216960 2219076 Okay. American?
2219240 2220355 Yes.

2227560 2230120 Denzel? Was it Denzel?<br />Denzel Washington?
2230280 2232475 It wasn't, unfortunately.
2232640 2233834 (SIGHS) Thank God.
2235320 2236594 Um... Be careful.

2266880 2268279 There it is.
2268920 2272435 Yes, I'm so glad I invited you tonight!
2272520 2273669 Yeah, me, too.
2273840 2277071 I usually bring these girls<br />I wanna sleep with, and they just suck!
2277240 2279674 You're like a breath of fresh air.
2279760 2281273 Aw, thanks.
2281440 2283800 I usually go out with men<br />I find interesting and non-stupid,
2283880 2285393 so this is a bit new for me, too.
2285480 2286674 Whoa!
2286920 2287920 Are we cool?
2288120 2289633 Did I say something wrong?
2289800 2290800 No.
2290880 2293394 No, I mean I was wondering why you<br />asked me along tonight,
2293600 2295909 and now I know you<br />just needed a ringer, so...
2296280 2298953 Oh, did you... You thought<br />this was a date? I didn't...
2299160 2302391 (LAUGHS) No, actually.<br />Well, I was hoping it wasn't.
2302840 2304558 Then why are you wearing lipstick?
2304720 2305914 - I'm not.<br />- Yeah, you are.
2306080 2307274 What are you...
2307440 2308759 You can't touch a girl's mouth.
2308920 2310736 Why? Are you scared I'm<br />gonna smear your lipstick...
2310760 2312432 Oh, my God! You bit me!
2312600 2313696 Yeah, and I'll bite you again.
2313720 2314755 There's lipstick on here.

2364720 2365948 What the fuck is that?
2366760 2368478 Oh. Well, I just came from
2368560 2370576 a six-hour murder mystery<br />where I played the corpse.
2370600 2373160 I must've dozed off<br />before I had a chance to clean up.
2373240 2375390 Well, you scared the shit out of us.
2375480 2376595 Really? Thank you.
2376680 2378720 Actually that means a lot<br />'cause I do my own makeup.
2378840 2381195 What kind of party<br />has a pregnant corpse?
2381360 2384477 No, I'm actually pregnant.<br />This isn't part of it. This is just...

2390800 2393837 to the murder mystery<br />Brooks Davis ordered.
2393920 2395831 Oh, my gosh.<br />But that would ruin the fun.
2395920 2398593 We don't want the fun.<br />We just wanna win.
2398680 2400352 Yeah, I can't do that.

2453000 2456675 I was hoping I wasn't<br />gonna have to dig this deep, but okay.
2456840 2458910 Final offer.
2465680 2469116 You know what? It doesn't matter<br />how slowly you slide it over!
2469320 2471550 Okay? It's $17! How much do you want?
2472400 2474595 - Um, I don't know. Probably $100.<br />- Give her $100.
2475000 2476513 (SOFTLY) I don't have a hundred.
2477400 2479356 How much have you got?
2480000 2481115 $17.
2481360 2483157 $17?

2498440 2499668 'cause we're way behind.
2499760 2501079 Don't you get it?
2501160 2502832 That was not supposed to happen.
2504920 2507229 Oh, what now? You guys already<br />did the breaking-in thing.
2507320 2509754 Shut up! And get on the floor,<br />all of you!

2525080 2526656 We can check,<br />but that doesn't make any sense.
2526680 2527908 I'm not wearing a jacket.
2528080 2530469 Maybe it means, like a book jacket.

2717280 2719376 Brooks, what the fuck<br />is going on with you? Start talking!
2719400 2721834 I've lied to you<br />and the family about what I do.
2721920 2724878 I buy and I sell illegal shit for people<br />in the black market.
2724960 2726234 Really? So you're a criminal?
2726320 2727640 Oh, my God! They're following us!
2729320 2730656 But I made a mistake,<br />because there's this guy.
2730680 2731736 They call him the Bulgarian.
2731760 2734069 He's got his fingers in all these pies<br />around the world.
2734240 2736231 - What kind of pies?<br />- Illegal pies, Max.
2736320 2739136 You know, the kind of pies that have<br />heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.
2739160 2740216 You know, all that kind of stuff.
2740240 2742993 But he just wanted me to help him<br />find this Fabergé egg.
2743080 2745435 Fuck that! Fabergé egg?
2745520 2747056 - Are you kidding me?<br />- No, I'm serious.
2747080 2748080 And I found it!
2748160 2750799 But then there was this other guy,<br />this Marlon Freeman.
2750880 2752950 He's willing to pay twice as much<br />for the same egg.
2753040 2754576 So what? So you screwed over<br />the Bulgarian guy
2754600 2755936 and those fellows behind us<br />work for him,
2755960 2757776 and they just happen to crash your<br />murder mystery party?
2757800 2760075 I know, right?<br />What are the odds of that?
2761560 2763400 - Oh, too close, too close!<br />- Careful, careful!
2765040 2766268 Watch out! Watch out!
2766360 2767360 Oh, oh!
2770040 2771268 - Shit!<br />- Sorry! You okay?
2771440 2772475 Yeah, I'm all right.
2772560 2774994 - We need to go to the cops now!<br />- Yeah, right now! Let's go!
2775160 2776376 - We can't go to the cops!<br />- MAX: Why?
2776400 2777800 The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.
2777840 2778955 On his face?
2780640 2781959 No, in the police department.
2782120 2783439 Look out!
2784840 2786193 - Careful!<br />- (HORNS BLARING)
2790800 2792199 Oh, my God! This is insane!
2806640 2808915 If you call the cops,<br />I'll be dead before I get to jail.
2809080 2810656 Why don't we just get a hold<br />of this Marlon Freeman guy
2810680 2811816 and buy the egg back from him?
2811840 2814080 I couldn't find him if I wanted to.<br />That name's an alias.
2817960 2819552 - Gun, gun, gun! Duck!<br />- Oh, oh...
2829600 2831670 Okay, these guys are not stopping.<br />What do we do?
2831840 2834912 They're not gonna stop<br />until they get me.
2835080 2836991 I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this.
2837080 2838080 ANNIE: Oh, my God!
2838240 2840470 I'm sorry for a lot of things.
2842800 2845320 - Hey! What are you doing?<br />- What is he doing? What is he doing?
2845760 2847751 - I love you, Max!<br />- Brooks, don't be an idiot!
2848640 2849640 (GRUNTING)
2850320 2851320 MAX: Stop the car!
2858000 2859399 (BROOKS GROANING)
2860080 2862514 - Shit! Go, go, go!<br />- Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
2866000 2868281 Fuck! What are we gonna do?<br />They're gonna kill my brother.
2868320 2870040 Oh, Annie, I feel faint.<br />I'm gonna pass out.
2870080 2871877 Oh, honey, we'll get you<br />to a hospital, okay?
2872040 2873314 No, no, no! No hospitals.
2873480 2874816 This is a gunshot wound,<br />they'll call the cops.
2874840 2875840 Shit, shit! Okay.
2875920 2878434 So we go to a mob doctor, right?
2879520 2880976 Do you know one of those, sweetheart?
2881000 2882718 - No.<br />- No.
2882880 2884800 What about a veterinarian<br />that works for the mob?
2885120 2886838 - You know one of those?<br />- No.
2887000 2888576 Come on. Why are you pitching<br />all the mob stuff?
2888600 2890716 - I think 'cause I'm losing my shit here!<br />- I get it.
2890880 2891960 You're gonna have to do it.
2892000 2893000 - What?<br />- Yup.
2893080 2894336 You're gonna have<br />to take the bullet out.
2894360 2895616 I don't wanna... I don't wanna do it.
2895640 2896856 You think I want you<br />to take the bullet out?
2896880 2899240 I've seen you try to cut a chicken.<br />We have no other option.
2899320 2901709 (SOBS) Oh, my God! This is so bad!
2901880 2903438 I hate game night!
2907040 2908400 - Thank you!<br />- (CELL PHONE RINGING)
2909960 2910960 Hey!
2911040 2912760 Oh, thank God.<br />Listen, Annie. It's all real.
2912800 2913800 Oh, no, I know.
2913880 2915472 Brooks is caught up in something and...
2915680 2917033 Okay, where are you guys?
2917120 2918776 We're all at Brooks'.<br />Waiting to talk to the cops.
2918800 2921030 No! No, no, no! Do not talk to the cops!
2921200 2922280 What? Why? What's going on?
2922440 2923760 - Are you guys okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2923840 2925990 We're fine. We're fine.<br />I shot Max, but he's fine.
2926080 2927080 What?
2927160 2928576 Look. We will meet you<br />back at our house.
2928600 2930440 Whatever you do,<br />do not tell the cops anything.
2930520 2932795 Brooks's life depends on it.
2937480 2938879 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2939080 2940195 Okay.
2940360 2941395 I got a bunch of stuff.
2941480 2942480 Yeah.
2943040 2945235 Pocket knife. Tweezers.
2945320 2946753 Sewing kit. Gauze.
2946880 2948456 Good, good. All right.<br />Wow, you did great!
2948480 2950914 Yeah.<br />And they didn't have rubbing alcohol.
2951080 2953878 And they don't sell hard liquor,<br />so I got you this lovely chard.
2954040 2956156 Good idea. Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.
2956320 2958197 What else did you get, huh?<br />More good stuff?
2958760 2960990 What is helpful in Country Living?
2961160 2964914 Oh, that's for later. There's a corn<br />chowder recipe. It looks really good.
2965080 2967040 - You love corn chowder, huh?<br />- Sweet. I do, yeah.
2967080 2968216 - That'll cheer you up.<br />- Thank you.
2968240 2969719 Okay. And then a squeaky toy.
2970240 2971275 - Huh.<br />- For your mouth.
2971440 2972440 - For the pain.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2972600 2974200 Okay. Well, hopefully I won't need this.
2974280 2976077 - Okay, let's see this bad boy.<br />- All right.
2976280 2977349 Yeah, careful.
2977520 2979158 - Okay.<br />- All right.
2979240 2980376 - (ANNIE INHALES SHARPLY)<br />- (MAX GROANS)
2980400 2981400 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
2981560 2982696 - We're gonna push past it.<br />- No problem. No problem.
2982720 2983976 - We're gonna get the bullet out.<br />- Let's just Google.
2984000 2985416 Honey, can you return the text later?
2985440 2987280 This is instructions<br />on how to remove a bullet.
2988120 2989816 - Oh, sorry.<br />- It's an alt-right militia website,
2989840 2991480 so I'm just gonna<br />ignore the racist stuff.
2991600 2992669 - Good. Good, good.<br />- Yeah?
2992880 2994313 Okay. "Step one, sterile gloves."
2994760 2995988 Check!
2996160 2997336 We're doing the best we can, right?
2997360 2999078 Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.
2999240 3000753 "Step two."
3000840 3003434 Um... Okay. "Disinfect wound."
3003640 3005596 Right, yeah.<br />That's gonna sting, isn't it?
3005680 3007079 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
3007160 3008479 - Let's do it.<br />- Okay?
3008800 3010233 - (MUFFLED GROANS)<br />- (TOY SQUEAKING)
3010360 3012555 That smarts, huh?
3012720 3014472 - Yeah.<br />- (WHIMPERS)
3014640 3016596 Gonna administer anesthetic.
3016760 3018896 - We don't have that.<br />- Just gonna skip that one. Okay.
3018920 3020640 "Step four,<br />apply pressure above the wound."
3020680 3022591 Here, you squeeze that there.
3022680 3023776 - I got it.<br />- Great. Thank you.
3023800 3026360 We're just gonna<br />make two tiny incisions...
3026440 3028016 - Oh, my God.<br />- On either side of the wound.
3028040 3030235 Easy-peasy. Huh?
3030520 3031714 This is fun, huh?
3031840 3033671 - Are you having fun?<br />- No.
3033800 3034869 Let's get the bullet.
3034960 3036376 - Okay. Here we go.<br />- Let's get in there and get it.
3036400 3038576 - Nice and small, nice and small, baby.<br />- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
3038600 3039669 Tiny, teeny.
3039920 3041478 (TOY SQUEAKING)
3043440 3045749 That's not small. That's really big!
3045920 3046955 So big?
3047040 3049156 Way too big, baby.<br />It's a bullet, not a grapefruit.
3049240 3051456 I'm sorry! I'm sorry.<br />This is my first time. I don't know...
3051480 3052959 Oh, there's so much blood.
3053080 3054195 (GAGGING)
3054320 3057471 No, no. Don't you start doing that.<br />No, you're gonna make... (GAGS)
3057960 3059598 (BOTH GAGGING)
3060960 3061995 - I'm sorry.<br />- Stop it.
3062120 3063536 I'm looking at you,<br />and you're making me...
3063560 3065016 Well, don't look at me.<br />I won't look at it.
3065040 3066816 - Push through. Let's go.<br />- Okay. All right, okay.
3066840 3067936 - No more cutting.<br />- Oh, shit.
3067960 3069096 Just get the tweezers<br />and get the bullet out, baby.
3069120 3070348 Shit, shit, shit. Um...
3070440 3072556 - What? What happened?<br />- Phone went to sleep.
3072640 3073936 You gotta set it so that thing stays on.
3073960 3075176 - No. My phone doesn't do that.<br />- Sure it does.
3075200 3076576 Same phone as mine. Just change it.
3076600 3078936 Just gonna touch it with my nose<br />every 30 seconds. It's fine.
3078960 3080416 Don't be afraid of your phone.<br />Get in there, go to the settings,
3080440 3083176 go to "Display" and change the timing<br />so that it doesn't revert to sleep mode.
3083200 3084235 - Revert?<br />- Yeah.
3084320 3085976 What are you, Steve Jobs?<br />I'm not reverting anything. No.
3086000 3087096 No, I'm just<br />unafraid of my phone, honey.
3087120 3088120 It's so fucking simple.
3088600 3090318 Shh! Quiet. I know what I'm doing, okay?
3090520 3091714 Do you?
3091800 3092800 Yes.
3093000 3094752 - Here we go. Here we go.<br />- Here she goes.
3094920 3096399 You're like a dolphin.
3096560 3098278 All right. This part's gonna hurt.
3098440 3099589 I don't... I don't doubt it.
3099760 3101159 Okay, let's do this.
3101600 3102600 - (EXHALES)<br />- Okay.
3102680 3103680 (GASPS)
3103760 3104954 Ooh... Oh, wait.
3105520 3106840 - (CLICKING SOUND)<br />- What is that?
3106880 3107880 You hear that?
3108000 3109513 What's that sound? What's that sound?
3109600 3110828 Is that the bullet?
3111000 3113275 - (GASPS) That's bone!<br />- What?
3113360 3114918 That's not right.
3115360 3119194 Okay. Um, what do the racists say<br />if you can't find the bullet?
3119280 3120696 Yeah, that's bone. You got the bone.
3120720 3122711 I'm looking at my bone. Look right here.
3122880 3125952 (GASPS) Max, did you get shot twice?
3127080 3128229 (SIGHS)
3129160 3130275 That's the exit wound.
3130800 3132313 Oh, it came out!
3132440 3133919 Yup. Nothing to remove.
3134080 3135280 The bullet has exited the arm.
3135400 3136656 Well, let's just sew<br />that sucker up, huh?
3136680 3137680 Yeah.
3139960 3142599 No, no. Honey, don't, don't look at...
3142680 3143715 - (GAGS)<br />- Stop it.
3143800 3145916 (BOTH GAGGING)
3146120 3147189 ANNIE: I'm sorry.
3147520 3150136 Now, the Bulgarian's guys have Brooks,<br />and the only way to save him
3150160 3152390 is to get that egg<br />from this Marlon Freeman guy.
3152480 3155074 I can't believe your brother's been<br />lying to us this whole time.
3155160 3156878 He's even cooler than we thought.
3156960 3159349 Honey, I think you sewed my arm<br />to my sleeve.
3159440 3161616 I didn't even know<br />Morgan Freeman collected Fabergé eggs.
3161640 3163437 Aren't those worth millions of dollars?
3163520 3165476 It's Marlon Freeman,<br />but that's just an alias.
3165560 3167696 Somehow, we gotta find out<br />his real name, find out his address.
3167720 3169870 - Police computer.<br />- MAX: What do you mean?
3169960 3172030 I once dated this girl<br />whose father was a cop.
3172120 3174076 She showed me her dad's police computer.
3174160 3176958 It has a database with<br />every known alias on it.
3177040 3179679 I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'<br />real name on it.
3179760 3182376 So, if we called her up, would she<br />let you go on her dad's computer?
3182400 3184709 No. No. No way! That ended badly.
3185000 3187840 So how are we gonna get into a police<br />computer without the cops knowing?
3187880 3189256 - Billy Bob Thornton!<br />- MICHELLE: What?
3189280 3191316 - What?<br />- You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?
3191400 3195757 Hang on. Hang on. I know<br />where we can get on a police computer.
3196880 3199110 - Hey!<br />- ALL: Gary!
3199480 3200799 Goodness.
3201480 3203436 To what do<br />Bastian and I owe the pleasure?
3203600 3204999 Well, we were all just talking,
3205160 3207913 and we realized<br />we haven't had a game night in ages,
3208080 3209638 just the seven of us.
3209720 3210720 So...
3210800 3212756 I thought you were going<br />to your brother's house.
3212840 3213989 I never said that.
3214080 3216196 Come on, Gare Bear.<br />Live a little! It's the weekend!
3216280 3219397 We were just saying how you were always<br />better at games than Debbie was.
3219480 3221675 I'll thank you<br />not to besmirch my ex-wife.
3222120 3223599 That woman is an angel.
3223680 3227912 Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games<br />than you.
3228480 3234476 I will admit I have eagerly awaited<br />a visit such as this.
3240560 3241834 Where'd he go?
3242480 3243993 Do we follow him?
3244080 3245274 MAX: It seems like it.
3245360 3246998 - Ryan, you go first.<br />- I'm scared.
3253760 3256228 Help yourself to popped corn<br />with sea salt.
3256320 3258151 Oh! Oh!
3259040 3260519 (GROANS) Yummy, yummy.
3261040 3263634 I can't believe that you read my mind.<br />I was craving popcorn.
3263800 3266109 You have a framed photo of game night?
3266320 3270108 Doesn't everyone have photographs<br />of their best friends in their homes?
3271600 3273955 ANNIE: Of course. We do.
3274560 3276312 Max, uh, you wanna go first?
3276400 3278277 Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.
3278920 3280114 Oh. There's a loose one.
3280200 3282589 Always in the middle.<br />That's where you wanna go.
3282680 3284079 Can I use your john real quick?
3284160 3286549 Of course.<br />It's the end of the hall, next to our...
3287760 3289955 (BREATHES DEEPLY)
3290120 3291838 My bedroom.
3293320 3294355 Okay.
3316880 3318552 Oh, no, Gary.
3346200 3349715 So, Sarah, how long have you two<br />been a couple?
3350560 3353028 Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...
3353160 3356277 We work together. I wouldn't, um...<br />I wouldn't do that thing.
3356360 3361832 I see. I thought I detected a certain<br />chemistry between the two of you.
3361960 3364520 - (CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)<br />- No. No way.
3365160 3367310 - No, that's not...<br />- Mmm. Mmm.
3367640 3371269 Then again, I'm not the best judge<br />of chemistry in the world. (CHUCKLES)
3371800 3373313 (ALL CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY)
3379240 3380389 Hmm.
3381000 3382672 Oh, because your wife left you.
3383240 3384468 KEVIN: Oh, shit.
3394200 3396350 Hello, Donald Anderton.

3405400 3407356 - Oh! (GROANS)<br />- (ANNIE SIGHS)
3408040 3412556 So many possible moves.<br />I just don't know where to begin.
3414560 3416118 Um, maybe... Ooh...
3417440 3419056 - Decision-making.<br />- Come on, Annie. Just make up your mind.
3419080 3420638 - No!<br />- Please! No?
3422880 3425792 Yup, take your time.
3433920 3435751 (SNIFFING)
3457880 3460678 Oh, Brooks. What have you<br />gotten yourself into?
3477960 3482033 Oh, shit. Where did you<br />come from, little guy?
3483400 3487279 Son of a bitch.<br />Hey! What are you, a vampire?
3487520 3490159 Oh, God. Oh, God.
3493040 3496396 Oh, my God. Has that got it?
3496560 3500439 No, that doesn't got it.<br />God damn it. Come on!
3504960 3505960 No!
3507840 3508840 I should go check on him.
3508920 3510320 - (ALL EXCLAIM)<br />- I think he's fine.
3510560 3513552 - He cried out.<br />- SARAH: Tell me about Debbie.
3516400 3517628 I beg your pardon.
3518360 3522831 Oh, just I... I never met her.<br />I'd love to hear all about her.
3533800 3535233 Where do I begin?
3535400 3537994 All right, you wanna take a bath?<br />We'll take a little bath.
3538160 3542950 There we go. Okay.<br />All right. Here we go.
3545200 3548033 There we go, huh? Huh?
3549520 3550714 Oh, it's so much worse.
3551400 3554836 Oh, God. And what did I do to this?<br />What the fuck is this thing?
3556360 3557475 Oh, Debbie.
3557560 3558754 Oh!
3566320 3568754 Okay. Fuck this.
3569360 3571191 Hey, guys, Gary was right.<br />It's awful late.
3571280 3573589 Let's get home, get to bed, huh?<br />Get out of his hair.
3573680 3575875 We haven't finished the game.<br />It's your turn, Max.
3576040 3577268 Oh, my turn, huh?
3577440 3579954 Okay, be careful now, Max.<br />Oh! (GROANS)
3580040 3581758 Well, game over. I went in a little hot.
3581920 3584832 - GARY: Why did you...<br />- Thanks! Good to see you, Gary.
3585000 3587116 When shall we play next?
3587200 3590192 ANNIE: (STAMMERS) Soon. We'll call you.
3591040 3592040 (DOOR CLOSES)
3595040 3597918 Bastian. Baby!
3598360 3599656 - (CELL PHONE RINGING)<br />- (KEVIN SIGHS)
3599680 3603719 So, how are we supposed to get this egg<br />out of Donald Anderton's house?
3603800 3605438 I don't know. I'm gonna figure it out.
3606520 3609159 "Unknown Caller." Please don't be Gary.
3609240 3611834 - Hello?<br />- MAN: (DISTORTED) We have your brother.
3612720 3613869 Um...
3613960 3615473 Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,
3615560 3616776 and we're actually<br />on our way there right now.
3616800 3618536 We can do a swap, okay?<br />Please don't hurt Brooks.
3618560 3622473 Meet us on the East 4th Street bridge<br />at midnight. If you're late, he dies.
3622560 3623993 - Oh, my God.<br />- Um...
3624560 3627120 Boy, that's less than an hour from now.
3628560 3629629 Hello?
3629720 3632871 What's up with this guy's voice?<br />He sounds like a monster.
3633040 3634792 He's using a voice changer, Ryan.
3634880 3637189 He still sounds like a scary monster.
3640520 3644274 KEVIN: And we are here.
3644880 3645936 All right. You guys head home,
3645960 3647296 and I will call as soon<br />as I get the egg, all right?
3647320 3649470 What? Wait a second. Wait.<br />I'm going with you.
3649640 3651696 No, Annie. It could be very, very<br />dangerous in there, okay?
3651720 3654001 Listen, Brooks shouldn't have<br />dragged any of us into this,
3654040 3655776 but he is my brother,<br />and it's up to me to fix it.
3655800 3657870 No, bullshit!<br />We're all in this together!
3657960 3660076 No, no, no. Max is right.<br />You guys should go home,
3660240 3662435 but you and I are doing this.
3662600 3664955 Okay, what happens<br />if you guys don't make it out?
3665040 3667376 We don't come to game night because<br />we're dying to play charades and shit.
3667400 3668720 We come because we love you guys.
3668760 3670876 Honestly, this is<br />the best part of our week.
3670960 3674111 Mine, too. And I have<br />a lot of options on the weekend.
3674200 3676270 Wow. You guys...
3676400 3678391 Thank you. That's very nice.
3679120 3680917 Aw, good friends.
3681600 3684831 You should probably go, though, right?<br />I mean, you don't even know us.
3685240 3686798 Yeah, why are you still here?
3686880 3690236 Oh, I don't know.<br />I just got caught up in it.
3690320 3692311 Also, if I go home now,
3692400 3694216 and then I read in the newspaper<br />tomorrow that you all died,
3694240 3698199 I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,<br />so I'm gonna stick around.
3698960 3700996 You still read the newspaper?
3701160 3702957 That's what you got from that?
3703040 3705031 How are we gonna get into this place?
3706880 3708916 Go! Go! Go! Go!
3715360 3716839 Okay. (SHUSHING)
3718400 3721312 Looks like they got a party going on.<br />This could be good.
3733520 3735988 KEVIN: Where is everybody?
3744160 3745957 (PEOPLE SHOUTING)
3751680 3752908 No way!
3761440 3763556 It's some kind of rich guy's fight club.
3763640 3766473 I knew it. They are real.
3770520 3771589 Come on!
3783000 3786390 That's my Boomer! That's my Boomer!
3787200 3789111 Man, this is some<br />Django Unchained bullshit.
3789200 3790200 Water!
3791120 3794476 That's my boy! Good boy! Good boy!
3794680 3796830 Rich people are fucked up!
3797000 3799150 Kramer, get Logan ready!
3799320 3802153 Okay, minimum buy in is now 10 grand.
3802360 3803713 Okay, I think we should split up.
3803880 3805120 Yeah. And let's start upstairs.
3805160 3807120 Anybody finds the egg,<br />just text the others, okay?
3807160 3809016 And for God's sake, be careful with it.<br />All right?
3809040 3810040 Got you. I got it.
3810160 3811275 ANNIE: Be safe.
3813440 3814800 What are you...<br />What are you doing?
3814880 3816154 Who says the egg isn't in here?
3817160 3819958 Also, I have a really good feeling<br />about Logan.
3820120 3823351 Egg, egg, egg.<br />Wow! This is some bedroom.
3823520 3825176 Does it remind you<br />of your celebrity boyfriend's?
3825200 3826349 Are you still on this?
3826480 3829040 Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.<br />That's all I can think about.
3829120 3830189 And that's saying a lot,
3830280 3833397 considering we got Eyes Wide Fight Club<br />going on downstairs.
3833600 3835352 Why is this so important to you?
3835560 3839109 Because, Michelle, look,<br />I am losing my mind here. Okay?
3839280 3840679 We were broken up at the time.
3840840 3844150 I got a hand job from Karen Waller,<br />so you had every right to.
3844360 3845634 So why not just tell me?
3847720 3849756 Okay, fine.
3851520 3852999 It was 10 years ago.
3853200 3856909 I was at a gas station,<br />and I noticed a guy at the next pump.
3858760 3862230 It was Denzel Washington.
3862480 3863708 Hold up.
3865240 3867310 It actually was Denzel?
3867400 3868469 Yeah.
3872720 3874392 He was really nice.
3874480 3878268 He made some joke about how premium gas<br />is probably the same as regular.
3878360 3880954 I took a chance, and I asked him<br />if he wanted to get drinks.
3881040 3882268 He said yes.
3882920 3884433 We both got a little tipsy.
3884520 3886272 I offered to pay for drinks,<br />and he let me,
3886400 3887879 which I thought was pretty cool.
3889400 3891709 We danced for hours.
3894440 3896080 Eventually, we ended up<br />back at his place,
3896160 3899072 and one thing led to another.
3901040 3903952 It was just<br />this crazy thing that happened,
3904040 3905712 and, in a weird way, it made me realize
3905800 3909236 the only person<br />I ever wanna be with is you.
3911080 3912080 Nah.
3912560 3914039 Nah. I don't believe it.
3914320 3915958 - Oh, you...<br />- Mmm-mmm. (CHUCKLES)
3916040 3917917 Well, I took a picture with him<br />at the club.
3918080 3919832 I put it in a hidden folder.
3920920 3922035 Denzel and Michelle.
3927840 3929319 Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.
3929600 3930828 Yeah, it is.
3931000 3932149 Mmm. No, it's not.
3932280 3934635 Dude looks a lot like Denzel,
3935400 3936469 but, uh, it's not him.
3936640 3938835 You're crazy. That's...<br />Look at that, that's Denzel.
3939000 3941040 Okay, let me ask you this.<br />Did he say he was Denzel?
3941120 3942519 Well, no.
3943440 3946079 He tried to introduce himself,<br />and I cut him off
3946160 3948469 because I told him I knew who he was.
3951040 3953110 - What kind of car did he drive?<br />- A BMW.
3953200 3954428 - Hmm.<br />- Three series.
3954520 3957239 Mmm. What was his place like?
3958040 3960395 It... It was a two-bedroom condo.
3962360 3966797 And he used the, um, spare room<br />as an office, so...
3967320 3968920 Do you hear<br />what you're saying right now?
3969080 3970638 Hold on, let me see. (CLEARS THROAT)
3971640 3973835 KEVIN: When you zoom in,<br />the nose gives it away, right?
3975080 3976399 - God damn!<br />- Mmm-hmm.
3976480 3979472 Look, don't beat yourself up about it,<br />okay? There is some good news.
3979640 3982359 (IMITATES DENZEL WASHINGTON)<br />If you wanna get with Denzel, huh,
3982440 3984476 he's standing right here!
3984560 3989350 (LAUGHS) Because the real Denzel<br />ain't got shit on me.
3989480 3990708 (BOTH LAUGHING)
3992080 3997200 I mean, how does this monster have<br />five kids? We don't get to have one.
3997920 4000115 Well, his wife looks like<br />she's about 15.
4000240 4003550 Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.
4003720 4005915 Right, right. No, I know, honey.<br />We're just gonna...
4006080 4009675 We're gonna keep plugging away<br />until something sticks, okay?
4009760 4012513 Gee, you really sound like a guy<br />who wants to have a kid.
4012640 4013720 Well, you know, I'm just...
4013800 4016917 I'm a little distracted right now,<br />honey, as you might imagine.
4017000 4020709 Look, if you're not into this,<br />you kind of gotta tell me.
4021320 4022320 Listen.
4023000 4026151 I wanna have a baby,<br />but how do I explain this? Um...
4027480 4030040 Do you remember how we used to play<br />Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes,
4030120 4031216 and we could play all night?
4031240 4033496 Do you remember, this one time,<br />I made it all the way up to level 86,
4033520 4035896 - and you were not too far behind, right?<br />- Eighty-five, but...
4035920 4037400 And then I kicked your ass at Galaga.
4037440 4039320 - So anyway, what is the point?<br />- Mmm... Anyway,
4039360 4041271 do you remember<br />how we stayed alive so long?
4041360 4043271 All we did was we ate the pellets.
4043360 4046079 We never ate the fruit<br />because the fruit is how they get you.
4047920 4049273 Oh, you're doing a metaphor!
4049360 4050839 Yes, but here's the problem.
4050920 4053388 No matter how long you and I<br />stayed alive in the game,
4053480 4055600 neither one of us ever made it<br />up to the leader board.
4056840 4058751 And you think if we have a baby,
4058840 4060239 we'll be officially settling down,
4060320 4062709 and you'll never make it<br />onto the leader board of life?
4062800 4064392 That's such a good metaphor.
4064480 4066755 Yeah, no, it's not.<br />It's kind of bullshit.
4066840 4067840 Why?
4067920 4069717 - What are we, 16 years old?<br />- No.
4069880 4072553 You wanna go backpacking<br />through Europe? Huh?
4072720 4075553 You wanna, like, have some wine coolers<br />on a football field
4075640 4077312 with Rebecca De Mornay?
4077480 4079152 Not specifically.
4079320 4081880 You know<br />who's always gone for the fruit, Max?
4082040 4086238 Your criminal brother, and that is why<br />the ghosts are about to eat him!
4086400 4088118 Look who's embracing the metaphor.
4088200 4089679 I'm so... I'm... Wow.
4090160 4092833 You know what? All this time,<br />I've just been thinking
4092920 4097038 that if I helped you beat Brooks,<br />you would be less stressed.
4097120 4100590 But you don't wanna beat Brooks.<br />You wanna be Brooks.
4102720 4104517 I'm gonna look somewhere else.

4302560 4304312 (ALL PANTING)
4317440 4320830 So, you don't wanna have a baby,<br />so we can do more shit like that?
4321640 4323631 No. No.
4323960 4326190 Is that the fruit<br />you were thinking about?
4326360 4328237 Mmm-mmm.<br />That's not the fruit. No.
4328400 4329913 Hey, thanks for the assist.
4330080 4331559 Yeah.
4332040 4334395 I don't even know why<br />I really did it. (CHUCKLES)
4335120 4336776 Do you think<br />it's 'cause you're falling for me?
4336800 4338199 (BOTH LAUGH)
4339160 4340160 I...
4341040 4342712 Not... Not sure.
4343040 4345634 Ugh. I was joking.
4345800 4347358 Oh. Okay. Yeah.
4348400 4350356 Aren't you gonna say<br />you were joking, too?
4350520 4351748 Do you want me to?
4351920 4353336 - Oh, my God, you're making this weird.<br />- No, I'm not.
4353360 4354873 - Stop it.<br />- Okay, fine.
4354960 4357056 It's two minutes to 12:00.<br />Where the hell is this bridge?
4357080 4360117 GPS says it's right around here,<br />but I don't see it.
4360200 4361997 Oh, oh. Oh. There it is. 4th Street.
4362080 4363360 - Oh, shit!<br />- (BRAKES SCREECHING)
4363720 4365517 - (MAX GRUNTS)<br />- (ALL GASP)
4369480 4371471 - Oh, my!<br />- That's great.
4372040 4374156 That's great.<br />Now they're gonna kill my brother.
4376200 4377269 ANNIE: Oh, God!
4377840 4379239 Hold on.
4380240 4383437 I'm not an expert,<br />but these gems look plastic to me.
4383520 4385715 "Made in China."<br />Is this thing not even real?
4385800 4387597 Maybe just that sticker<br />was made in China.
4387680 4389016 - Let's let them talk.<br />- MAX: Can I see?
4389040 4391840 KEVIN: Hey, why would the Bulgarian<br />ask Brooks to bring him a fake egg?
4391920 4394912 Uh, I don't think he wanted<br />an egg at all.
4395000 4397992 I think he wanted<br />what was inside the egg.
4398960 4401076 "WITSEC." What is that?
4401200 4402235 Um...
4402320 4403992 We could ask them?
4421320 4423197 VAL: You tell anyone<br />we were coming here?
4423360 4424679 No.
4424840 4425989 I've got your egg.
4426080 4427080 You do?
4427160 4428639 Yeah, but we broke it.
4428800 4430233 - What?<br />- Well, it was a fake.
4430360 4431976 But we have the list of names<br />that was inside.
4432000 4433399 That's what you wanted, right?
4436800 4438870 Okay. Get on the ground.
4438960 4440816 We've got what you want.<br />Can't you just let us go?
4440840 4443115 I said, "On the ground!"
4444040 4445816 You, too, playboy, get over there.<br />Get on the ground.
4445840 4446955 COLIN: Yeah.
4447040 4448840 VAL: None of that<br />child pose bullshit, either.
4449440 4452000 The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,<br />probably you guys, too.
4452160 4453388 Why did you come here?
4453680 4455456 Because you're my brother,<br />and I can't just let you die,
4455480 4456656 even though you might deserve it.
4456680 4458796 Yeah, it's me. We got them all here.
4458960 4461554 You're unbelievable, you know that?
4461720 4463870 You've always<br />been a better person than me.
4464040 4465632 You gotta shut up. Okay?
4465800 4468712 Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.
4468880 4471553 I'm not the carefree dude<br />that wins at everything he touches.
4471640 4474074 You know how I win?<br />I cheat. I cheat at everything.
4474160 4476276 I even cheated when we were kids<br />playing Battleship.
4478000 4479228 What?
4479320 4482790 Didn't you ever wonder why I made you<br />sit with your back to the TV?
4482880 4485678 It was so I could see your ships<br />in the reflection.
4485760 4489275 I mean, I even took five grand<br />every time we played Monopoly
4489360 4490960 before we even started playing the game.
4491040 4494430 I cheated at the Game of Life.<br />And at the game of life.
4494600 4495919 You son of a bitch.
4496000 4498195 - You son of a bitch!<br />- VAL: Sit down.
4499280 4501296 - What about you, Princess?<br />- I don't have anything.
4501320 4504756 But it didn't stop there<br />because, when we grew up, Max,
4504840 4507115 you went off to college, and I...
4508200 4510236 You got a career.
4510440 4513034 You married the greatest girl<br />in the world.
4513200 4515031 I knew I couldn't keep up<br />with that success.
4515200 4517077 So I...
4517280 4519396 I told everyone that I got a job<br />on Wall Street.
4519560 4520959 And I did.
4521160 4523913 Selling coke to traders.
4525280 4526429 You didn't invest in Panera?
4526600 4527999 I ate at Panera.
4528160 4529718 Jesus Christ.
4529800 4531597 VAL: What's going on?
4531680 4533536 But that's why I've been trying<br />to make it up to you.
4533560 4534936 That's what this whole game night<br />was about.
4534960 4537952 See, I had it rigged<br />so that you'd finally win.
4539000 4541912 The last clue was gonna lead you...
4542000 4543319 Your jacket pocket.
4553080 4554513 ANNIE: Huh.
4556920 4558672 Surprise! (CHUCKLES)
4561880 4564838 I even managed to fuck that up, though.<br />I'm so sorry.
4564920 4566911 I'm so sorry, Max. (SIGHS)
4567680 4568776 (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
4568800 4570950 I think we're gonna be okay, though.<br />I got a feeling.
4571040 4572234 You want us to kill them all?
4573320 4574355 What?
4574440 4576096 - Okay.<br />- ANNIE: Wait, wait. Just let us go.
4576120 4577296 We won't tell anyone anything.
4577320 4579080 - We got you the list!<br />- (SIRENS APPROACHING)
4579280 4581714 - What the fuck, man?<br />- COLIN: Fuck! God damn it!
4583720 4585016 - Oh, shit. The fuzz.<br />- Fuck, man!
4585040 4586359 Freeze!
4586600 4587635 MAX: Gary?
4587720 4588816 Don't even think about it, pig.
4588840 4590400 Can't say I care for that nomenclature.
4590680 4591715 (YELLS)
4591800 4592835 (ALL GASPING)
4593680 4594795 MAX: Get down!
4595640 4597392 COLIN: Come on, bitch!
4598960 4599960 Motherfucker!
4601280 4602280 (GROANS)
4603360 4604360 (GROANING)
4604720 4606119 God damn it!
4614240 4615673 Hey, isn't that your neighbor?
4616160 4617416 KEVIN: When did Gary get so cool?
4617440 4618475 RYAN: Oh, my God!
4618560 4619675 Everybody okay?
4619800 4621456 - You're a cool-ass cat, Gary.<br />- You all right?
4621480 4623072 Fine, thank you,
4623880 4627589 though, in sliding, my belt buckle<br />may have inadvertently scratched
4627680 4629238 the finish of my squad car.
4629320 4630912 How did you know we were in trouble?
4631000 4633150 The nocturnal Jenga game,
4634040 4636235 my blood-spattered marital souvenirs,
4636360 4639989 and Max's curious search history<br />piqued my interest.
4640080 4642435 - Right. Oh, God.<br />- You, uh...
4642520 4644238 You saved our lives.
4644320 4645469 Thank you.
4646120 4647360 - Just doing my job.<br />- (GUNSHOT)
4649160 4650309 - RYAN: Oh, my God!<br />- ALL: Oh!
4650400 4652470 - SARAH: Shit!<br />- KEVIN: Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
4653680 4654715 ANNIE: Gary!
4656160 4657856 SARAH: Hello? I need an ambulance.<br />Officer down.
4657880 4659376 - ANNIE: Oh, shit!<br />- MAX: Hang in there, pal.
4659400 4660753 Hang on. Hang on, pal.
4660840 4662016 Hang on. You're gonna be all right.
4662040 4663216 We're gonna get you to a hospital.
4663240 4664878 Okay, look at me. Gary, look.
4664960 4666916 You have got a lot to live for, okay?
4667000 4668000 Do I?
4668080 4669559 - MAX: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br />- ANNIE: Yeah.
4669640 4671517 I have no wife.
4672960 4674632 - No friends.<br />- MAX: That's not true.
4674800 4675915 No, don't say that.
4676080 4677936 - You got us. We're your friends.<br />- You've got us.
4677960 4682431 You don't even like<br />spending time with me.
4682520 4683839 Yes, we do. We just...
4683920 4685592 We've been a little selfish. That's all.
4685680 4687416 - Right, right.<br />- You know, I'm sorry about that.
4687440 4688440 Oh, God. Oh, God.
4688520 4690317 - (WEAKLY) Bastian.<br />- MAX: Huh?
4691680 4694274 Someone please take care of Bastian.
4694360 4697511 Gary, you are gonna take care of Bastian<br />yourself, okay?
4697600 4698776 Listen, soon as you get out<br />of the hospital,
4698800 4700880 you're gonna come to every single<br />game night we have.
4702000 4703319 Don't...
4703680 4704749 MAX: Yeah?
4704840 4707752 Don't you ever
4709600 4711591 exclude me again.
4711680 4714558 - Never exclude you again, pal.<br />- ANNIE: No.
4716320 4718629 - Oh, God. What is that?<br />- What's that?
4718720 4720676 ANNIE: Is that a blood clot?
4721240 4723549 It's a blood capsule.
4723640 4725312 - ANNIE: Huh?<br />- A blood capsule?
4726200 4729909 And that is how<br />you do a game night. (CHUCKLES)
4733560 4734629 What?
4736760 4738398 I've duped you all.
4738480 4739480 MICHELLE: Wha...
4740400 4743676 Hold on a second. Are you telling me<br />that this whole thing was a game?
4744040 4746156 - (BOTH GRUNTING)<br />- (SCREAMS)
4746240 4747468 - What? What?<br />- KEVIN: Damn!
4747560 4748560 SARAH: Shit!
4748680 4750398 I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.
4750480 4752776 When I learned you stopped inviting me<br />to your game nights,
4752800 4755598 I hijacked<br />Brooks's murder mystery party,
4755680 4757511 and I staged a kidnapping of my own.
4757600 4759079 You gotta be kidding me.
4759160 4762357 What better way to prove my worth<br />as a game night participant?
4762440 4764476 Well, what about these dudes?<br />Are they actors?
4764560 4766516 Oh, no. They're... They're felons.
4766600 4767600 Felons?
4767680 4769336 I was able to shave some time off<br />of their parole
4769360 4771555 in exchange<br />for this little side project.
4771800 4772915 We square now?
4773000 4774319 Thank you, gentlemen.
4774400 4775674 That lady hit me with the car.
4775760 4777376 Hey, what the hell kind of psycho<br />are you?
4777400 4779994 You put us through all this,<br />just for your own amusement?
4780080 4783436 No, no. Just the opposite.<br />For your amusement.
4783520 4784669 Did everyone have fun?
4784800 4786438 - ALL: No! No.<br />- RYAN: Yeah. No.
4786520 4788158 No fun! I got shot!
4788240 4789309 By me!
4789400 4791960 I don't see how that's possible.<br />My men were using blanks.
4792040 4793996 Well, that was my gun.<br />It was a real gun.
4794080 4796753 So, this whole thing, the Fabergé egg,
4796840 4798353 the Bulgarian, that was you?
4800040 4801109 You've lost me.
4801200 4803350 The egg, the WITSEC list?
4803440 4805476 It's all you. All part of your game?
4809080 4811656 This is a list of people in<br />the Federal Witness Protection program.
4811680 4812795 How did you get this?
4812880 4815269 From inside the egg.<br />Stop fucking with us. It's over!
4815360 4818079 I'm not fudging with you.<br />I honestly have no idea what... (GROANS)
4820080 4822435 Oh, boy. Yikes!
4823320 4825096 - I mean, how stupid do you think we are?<br />- Hey, Max.
4825120 4827156 Gang, are we looking<br />at the big twist here?
4827240 4828753 He gets shot again!
4828840 4831496 And by who? A couple of new characters<br />you introduce at the last minute.
4831520 4833033 Dude, you've jumped the shark!
4833120 4834712 Do you go to the magic shop
4834800 4837040 - to buy a bunch of these little bullets?<br />- No. (SCREAMS)
4839120 4840473 Hang on.
4840560 4843518 This is Officer Kingsbury.<br />We got a 10-00 on the 4th Street.
4843600 4844600 - (GROANS)<br />- (ALL GASP)
4846520 4848750 Which one of you is Brooks Davis?
4851560 4854199 It's funny.<br />You don't look like an asshole.
4854960 4856996 Do I look like an asshole to you?
4857560 4858629 No.
4858720 4860995 One of us has to be the asshole<br />in this transaction
4861080 4863674 because otherwise I'd have my egg,<br />and you'd have your money.
4863760 4867116 But instead, we've wasted our night<br />tracking you down.
4868880 4870598 Now, we're gonna have to kill you.
4870680 4872318 - What? No, no, no, no.<br />- What?
4872680 4874113 Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?
4874280 4877158 Hi, I'm Max. (STAMMERS)<br />I'm Brooks's brother.
4877240 4879310 And, you know, look. He screwed up.
4879400 4880656 - Right? You got greedy.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4880680 4881715 He admits it.
4881800 4883677 Good news is, though,<br />that we got your egg.
4884160 4886515 It is broken. Uh, my screw up.
4886600 4889068 But, um, I got the list.
4889160 4890960 Which I bet you've been after<br />this whole time.
4891040 4892040 What about this?
4892120 4894031 How about
4894680 4898673 you take this list for free,<br />and we all go our separate ways?
4898760 4900716 Nobody gets hurt.
4900800 4903758 Uh, except the poor folks on this list,<br />I'm guessing.
4904200 4905394 (CHUCKLES)
4905960 4907075 Okay.
4907760 4908760 Okay?
4908880 4911440 Deal. Makes perfect sense.
4911520 4913520 No, no. You give him that list,<br />he's gonna kill me.
4913560 4914879 (LAUGHING) That's nonsense.
4916320 4917320 (GULPS)
4917800 4919631 What the hell is wrong with you?
4920120 4922076 I'm just trying to buy myself some time.
4922160 4925232 Not much. We're just gonna<br />cut it out of you on the jet. Take him.
4928800 4930472 Don't follow us, Max. I'm serious!
4930560 4932676 I'm not worried about that.
4934240 4935468 (MICHELLE YELPING)
4936320 4937799 You just letting them go?
4937880 4939950 Yeah, they've done nothing wrong.
4940080 4942071 Only this one.
4942400 4943833 - Let's go.<br />- Don't follow us!
4943920 4945956 Gary! He's breathing.
4947120 4949376 You know, the only private air terminal<br />around here is at Conway.
4949400 4950958 Yeah. How are we gonna get there?
4951480 4952936 Brooks's house is<br />not that far from here.
4952960 4954075 But our car's not there.
4955280 4956429 Yeah, it is.
4966320 4969039 You know, you don't have to do this<br />because I can just poop it out.
4969880 4973190 We're not gonna go digging<br />through your feces. That's disgusting!
4973320 4975356 Now, hold still<br />while I cut your stomach open.
4975440 4976759 No, no! No! Whoa!
4978040 4979314 What the hell?
4981600 4983397 - Is that...<br />- That's my brother.
4983480 4985038 Get us in the air.
4985120 4986120 Now!
4997240 4998275 - Hold on!<br />- Oh!
5001920 5003194 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, you?
5003280 5004395 - Yup, good.<br />- Okay.
5009080 5010672 Okay, okay. What's our plan?
5010760 5012159 (STAMMERS) I have one idea.
5012240 5014515 It's so crazy, though, baby,<br />it just might work.
5014600 5015776 You're gonna<br />crash the car into the plane,
5015800 5017631 like Liam Neeson in Taken 3?
5018000 5019592 He did that in Taken 3, huh?

5115680 5118069 - Let's talk!<br />- Can you charade it to me?
5118160 5119991 Charades?
5120600 5122795 That's some cute full-circle bullshit.
5122880 5124518 Here we go. Three words.

5171440 5172998 Oh, boy, that was...
5173080 5174296 You saw what I was going for,<br />though, right?
5174320 5175320 Yeah, yeah.
5175440 5177736 But then did you see when I hit him<br />with the fire extinguisher?
5177760 5180016 - I sure did. I sure did, yeah.<br />- That was cool, right? Yeah.
5180040 5181109 - Yeah.<br />- Great.
5181200 5182200 Do you want this?
5182320 5184515 Well, I don't want you to have it,<br />Calamity Jane.
5184600 5185794 All right, look.
5185880 5188155 I think I saw a hatch<br />at the top of the plane.
5188240 5189559 Maybe I can get the drop on him.
5189640 5191073 - "The drop"?<br />- Yup, yeah.
5191160 5192160 Who are you?
5192240 5193336 Why don't you go use<br />the emergency phone? Call for help.

5344480 5346118 You put a bungee cord in your hand,
5346200 5348156 you go straight to the pervy place,<br />don't you?
5348280 5349280 Hey.
5349360 5351078 You saved my life. Thank you.
5351560 5352959 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
5353040 5355554 I mean, I just saw a man die,<br />but I'm... I'm okay.
5355640 5356834 (ANNIE GASPS)
5356960 5358837 Is that a knife in your bullet hole?
5358920 5360558 Uh-huh. Hey. I wanna have a baby.
5361120 5362235 Uh, what?
5362320 5363616 I used to think that<br />I wanted Brooks' life,
5363640 5365312 but, you know, turns out he was just...
5365400 5366958 You're a loser. He's a loser.
5367040 5368075 Uh, guilty.
5368160 5369673 But us making a family?
5369880 5372917 That's... That's not pellets.<br />That's the fruit.
5373080 5374798 That's fruit. It's fruit.
5374880 5376199 Wait. What's going on?
5376480 5378755 Plus, think about all the dumdums<br />that have kids, right?
5378840 5381496 And think about how much better<br />our kid is gonna be than their kids.
5381520 5383351 It's gonna beat their kids<br />at everything.
5383480 5384993 It's taken you this long to see that?
5385080 5386991 Our baby is gonna crush<br />every other baby.
5387080 5389056 That's right. That's right.<br />And not in that "peak too early,"
5389080 5390376 you know, "kid actor" kind of way,<br />you know?
5390400 5391400 Mmm-mmm. No.
5391480 5393436 We will parcel out<br />his or her gifts over time.
5393520 5394589 - Absolutely.<br />- Yes.
5394680 5396016 We gotta teach it Mandarin right away.
5396040 5397080 'Cause China's the future.
5397160 5398388 - It sure is.<br />- Yeah.
5398480 5400198 - You're the future.<br />- Oh, my God.
5403600 5405113 ANNIE: Hmm?
5406080 5408514 And that concludes my game night.
5409320 5410594 BOTH: What?
5410680 5411776 It went exactly as I planned.
5411800 5414872 You learned every lesson<br />that I wanted you to.
5414960 5416791 Trevor, you can get up now.
5422000 5424720 I'm just fucking with you, but that<br />would've been really cool, right?
5424760 5426200 - You're such a dick.<br />- (ANNIE SIGHS)
5426280 5428748 (ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

5440840 5443673 Come on, come on. Hey, thanks<br />for letting me host again, huh?
5443840 5445637 Well, it's not like we had a choice.
5445800 5447552 BROOKS: Only 36 months to go.
5447720 5448976 - ANNIE: Oh, time will fly.<br />- (LAUGHS)
5449000 5450256 - Can I get you a beer?<br />- Uh, yeah.
5450280 5451838 - Come on!<br />- Hey, listen, Brooks.
5452240 5454959 I know you're probably feeling<br />pretty humbled by all of this.
5455040 5458316 But, honestly, I think you're gonna come<br />out the other side a much better man.
5458720 5459869 Oh! Hey, look.
5459960 5461359 I completely agree.
5461440 5463112 You remember the WITSEC list<br />I swallowed?
5463200 5464394 - Sure.<br />- I pooped it out,
5464520 5467193 sold it for $3 million<br />on the black market.
5468080 5469911 - Are you serious?<br />- Pretty sweet, huh?
5470640 5472640 Brooks, everybody on that list<br />is gonna get killed.
5472800 5474119 Oh, no, Max, I'm not a monster.
5474320 5476515 I tipped everyone off<br />that they were in danger.
5476680 5478636 For $20,000 apiece.
5479760 5481096 - (LAUGHING)<br />- You're unbelievable.
5481120 5483554 Thank you. It's not like<br />I'm gonna live in this dump forever.
5483640 5486336 As soon as this cuff comes off,<br />I'm gonna buy that house I was renting.
5486360 5487679 I'm moving in with Johanna.
5488280 5489349 There she is.
5489440 5490475 Hey, Dr. Chin!
5490560 5492039 Hey, Max.
5492120 5493473 - Let's play.<br />- Yeah.
5494280 5495429 Uh, The Crying Game?
5495840 5496875 Uh, Boys Don't Cry?
5496960 5498871 Is that a tear? No, is that the actor?
5499040 5500376 - Mr. Potato Head.<br />- Are you drawing the actor?
5500400 5501469 - Cry-Baby?<br />- Yes!
5501600 5502669 Time!
5502760 5504637 - It was The Green Mile.<br />- ALL: What?
5504720 5506278 How is that The Green Mile?
5506880 5509314 This is me at the Regal Cinema crying
5509440 5511908 as I did through much of the film.
5513000 5514600 How were we supposed to know that, Gary?
5514640 5517837 I assume everyone cried<br />during The Green Mile.
5518800 5519800 So, who's next?
5519880 5520880 I'll go.
5520960 5522279 - Yeah!<br />- MAX: Go, baby!
5522360 5523496 - ALL: Yeah!<br />- MICHELLE: Nice try, Gary.
5523520 5525033 And go!
5525600 5526635 ANNIE: Uh...
5526720 5528376 - MAX: It's a rock.<br />- MICHELLE: A bean? A rock!
5528400 5529674 - A ball?<br />- KEVIN: That's a...
5529760 5531176 - Burger. Is that a burger?<br />- RYAN: Football! Football!
5531200 5532776 MAX: No, oh,<br />that's a dinner roll, right?
5532800 5533994 - A bun!<br />- MICHELLE: Bread?
5534080 5535877 Is it a bun? Looks like a bun.
5535960 5536960 SARAH: French loaf?
5537040 5539216 - Is this a motion picture?<br />- MAX: Bun is in a house. On a train.
5539240 5540456 GARY: Aren't you supposed<br />to announce it?
5540480 5542336 - SARAH: Microwave?<br />- MAX: It's being cooked. It's in an oven.
5542360 5543896 - Bun in the oven!<br />- SARAH: Yes, yes, yes!
5543920 5546798 - (KEVIN LAUGHS)<br />- Wait. What?
5547200 5548633 Yes.
5549760 5550829 You pregnant?
5550920 5552399 We did it.
5560520 5562795 RYAN: Oh, my gosh!<br />They're having a baby!
