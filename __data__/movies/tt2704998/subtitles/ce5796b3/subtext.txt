41374 44752 -(PEOPLE CHEERING)<br />-MAX: Whoo!
44835 47045 (LAUGHS) Who cares about<br />winning? Let's get drunk!
47713 49214 Let's do it.
49298 51758 Let's get you drunk, Merkins.<br />You, too, Borgs.
51842 53677 I'm thirsty. Huh?
54887 57180 I need four shots of vodka,<br />four shots of water.
57265 59100 I want you to send the vodka<br />over to the Merkins.
59183 60934 Send the water to us. You understand?
61018 62644 CARTER: What former<br />Supreme Court Justice--
62728 64312 -Oliver Wendell Holmes!<br />-Correct.
64397 65773 ALL: Yes!
65856 68483 Again, I'd like to ask the players<br />to allow me to--
68568 70194 To finish the question.
70361 71737 -(ALL LAUGHING)<br />-Very funny.
71904 73906 Okay, okay.<br />This is getting embarrassing,
73990 75866 SO we need to focus
76033 77492 because this isn't a game.
77660 79161 It literally is.
79328 81580 Bill, do not test me right now.
81664 83123 CARTER: Looks like<br />we're down to two teams.
83749 85917 So, for double points,
86002 88295 what is the name<br />of the purple Teletubby?
89088 91632 BOTH: Tinky Winky!<br />CARTER: You're both correct.
93134 94760 He always carried a--
94927 96678 -Red purse.<br />-Yeah.
96846 99473 -And he loved big hugs.<br />-Big hugs.
99640 101558 I know. I'm Max.
101726 103060 Annie.
121120 122996 Ha-ha! You're never gonna be able<br />to hold on to Asia! You hear me?
123164 125332 Hey, if you take Kamchatka,<br />and I take Mongolia,
125499 126750 we could trap Linda in the middle.
126917 127918 -MAX: Starve out her armies.<br />-Hey!
128085 129252 You can't form alliances.
129420 131088 Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?
131255 132965 You're high-fiving Hitler?
135259 137135 MAX: All right, you got this. Last one.
137803 140430 Oh, that's Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.
140640 141807 -(ALL GROAN)<br />-Yes!
141974 142975 I'm up. I feel good.
143142 144184 Two words.
144352 145895 Bill. Overweight.
146062 147188 -No.<br />-Single. Out of work.
147271 148272 What the fuck?
148356 149690 Hairy.
149857 151316 Uh, carry, marry.
151484 152568 Marry!
152735 154361 You. Me.
154445 155446 Marry me?
155529 157113 -(WHOOPING)<br />-Dude, we got it! We got it!
157657 159700 Annie, will you?
159784 161285 -(GASPS)<br />-Will you marry me?
161369 162787 -Is that a yes? That's a yes!<br />-Yeah!
162953 165121 I'm really happy for you guys.
165831 168416 (ALL CHEERING)
179011 180637 ANNIE: Ooh, lot of pressure here.<br />MAX: Yeah.
180805 182097 ANNIE: You miss, you lose it all.
182181 183223 MAX: Stay out of my head.
183307 185183 And you know you have a distinct<br />advantage with the smaller hands, right?
185267 186768 Your goal posts are not as big.
186936 188646 Well, I guess you<br />should've married Uma Thurman.
188729 189896 Yeah, that would've been great.
189980 192148 -There's a snap. Here's the hold.<br />-(CELL PHONE CHIMES)
192817 194276 -Ooh!<br />-And a text.
194360 195569 That was interference.
195653 197237 ANNIE: Sorry, honey. I know how much<br />that meant to you.
197321 198864 MAX: Come on.
198948 200282 Dr. Chin is ready for you.
200366 201450 Uh, great.
201534 204203 I think we've determined why you've<br />been having trouble conceiving.
204370 206955 MAX: Okay. Let's have it.<br />ANNIE: Okay, great.
207123 209333 Oh, what's that look? Is it me?<br />Of course, it's me.
209417 211460 I'm not loving your semen.
211544 212628 Oh?
212712 215715 Your count is excellent,<br />but your motility is well below normal.
215881 217757 -That's too bad.<br />-What would cause that?
217925 220761 It can be genetic,<br />environmental factors.
220928 223221 Nine times out of 10, though,<br />it's psychological.
223389 225933 Have you been feeling<br />anxious or stressed?
226100 228227 No, I don't think so. Not really.
228394 229895 Uh... He's always a little stressed.
230813 231897 You don't have to write... I'm not...
232064 233148 Honey, she's writing it down.
233357 236610 Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.
236736 237737 We sure are.
237820 239279 One of the reasons<br />I fell in love with him.
239447 243284 Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more<br />prone to stress than normal people.
243451 245369 "Normal people"?
245453 246620 How long has this been going on, Max?
246787 247996 It's not going on.
248497 250957 Oh, well, you did say,<br />even when you were a Kid,
251041 253126 you would freak out<br />if you lost at anything.
253544 255671 -Oh, I was a kid.<br />-Especially if you lost to your brother.
255838 256964 Hmm.
257590 259383 Hey, is that what this is?
259467 260468 No.
260551 264263 You have been so uptight since you<br />found out that Brooks is coming to town.
264346 265889 -I don't think that's true.<br />-Could that be a factor in all this?
265973 266974 Let's be fair.
267057 269350 Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.
269435 271520 Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.
271687 273271 -The what?<br />-The brothers.
273439 275983 I'm not sure why we're discussing this.<br />She's not a therapist.
276150 278152 You're not a therapist, right?<br />With all respect.
278319 279820 -No, but I am a doctor.<br />-Sure.
279904 281864 And I believe in<br />treating the whole patient.
281947 285033 So, what is it about your brother<br />that makes you feel emasculated?
285201 286619 Are we gonna do this?
286786 288454 We're right next to the room<br />where I masturbated.
288621 292041 I think he has it in his head<br />that Brooks is cooler
292124 295210 and more successful<br />and hotter than he is.
295294 296545 I never said hotter.
296712 298213 He's charming.
298380 300673 That's interesting. And is he single?
300841 301842 MAX: What's that?
301926 305179 I don't know if I mentioned it, but<br />Keith and I are on a trial separation.
305262 306596 -Oh.<br />-Keith?
307139 308181 Uh, Keith.
308265 310225 So, do you think your brother would<br />wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?
310559 311643 Gosh, I don't know.
311811 313187 Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.
313354 314813 Hurts a little. (SCOFFS)
314980 317399 Now, is he a tall fellow?<br />"Cause I'm only 5'2".
317566 318900 We're all done with my semen?
319068 320527 He is taller than Max.
320694 322904 -Good.<br />-But he did date this ballerina once,
322988 324781 and she was<br />just a teeny-tiny little thing.
344009 345260 Ooh.
345344 347721 Honey, Gary.<br />Don't mention game night, okay?
347805 348847 Mmm-hmm.
348931 350724 -Good evening, Max.<br />-Hey, Gary.
350891 352058 -Annie.<br />-Hello there.
352226 353852 Hi, Gary!
354311 355854 Just checking the mail.
355938 356939 Oh, yeah?
357022 358481 Some people check it earlier in the day,
358649 362486 but there's always a risk<br />that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.
363487 367824 This spares me the chance<br />of a futile trip to the mailbox.
369493 370619 Uh-huh.
370703 375040 Plus, it allows Bastian here<br />the opportunity to urinate.
376125 377835 You have a good one.
378002 379211 Any plans for this evening?
379378 380629 MAX: No.
381297 382673 Perhaps a game night?
382840 384258 We're just gonna stay in,
384341 385633 -just the two of us.<br />-Mmm-hmm.
385718 387302 -Boring.<br />-Mmm.
387469 388803 I see.
390014 394514 I do hope you keep me in mind<br />for any future game nights.
395019 396020 You bet.
396103 399856 I've always enjoyed<br />the camaraderie of good friends
400024 402943 competing in games of chance and skill.
403527 406279 (STAMMERING) Yeah.<br />Yeah, well, we'll do that,
406447 410075 but tonight, it's just the two of us.
410659 413745 Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.
419627 421962 There was a special on these tonight.
422421 423588 Three for one.
423756 425174 Three for one?
425799 426841 Yup.
426926 429136 How can that be profitable<br />for Frito Lay?
430346 432222 These corporations,
433599 435434 - I don't know what they're doing.<br />-(CHUCKLES)
435851 438395 Well, you two enjoy each other.
439188 443688 It's often we don't appreciate<br />what we have until it's gone.
448072 449698 MAX: I think that's it.<br />ANNIE: Okay.
449865 450991 Bye-bye!
457289 459499 If Gary sees the others coming,<br />we're screwed.
459667 460793 No, no, honey,<br />it's not gonna be a problem.
460960 463087 I was very, very clear with everyone<br />to park far away
463253 465129 and just to sneak in quietly, you know.
465297 467799 But now, I mean, you don't think<br />we're being dicks, do you?
467967 469343 I mean,<br />should we just still invite the guy?
469426 470510 He really seemed like he wanted to play.
470678 472513 No, no. Debbie was our friend,
472680 474807 and Gary was just the creepy husband<br />that we had to put up with.
474890 475891 That's true.
475975 477351 He's only gotten worse<br />since the divorce.
477518 480270 Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?<br />Fuck him!
480354 481521 (RUSTLING)
501834 502835 (ANNIE SCREAMS)
506880 508006 Hi!
508173 509549 Hi.
512970 514554 ANNIE: Can we help you?
514722 515931 I'm okay.
516265 517266 Hey!
517433 519226 Of course. Ryan, why are you<br />coming in through the window?
519393 522687 You said sneak in<br />so RoboCop wouldn't see us.
522855 524147 I meant sneak in through the door.
524314 525523 Well, you were super vague.
525691 526858 -I wasn't vague at all.<br />-Wine?
527026 528485 I know I didn't say,<br />"Break the succulents."
528652 530862 -RYAN: Hey.<br />-I'm not dressed for this nonsense.
530946 531947 This is ridiculous.
532031 533032 It's like<br />Night of the Living Dead in here.
533115 534699 Yeah, you are asking a lot from us, Max.
534783 536075 MAX: I didn't say<br />to come through the window.
536243 537702 This is Max. We used to work together.
537870 538954 -His wife, Annie. Michelle.<br />-Hey!
539038 540039 And that guy, Kevin.
540122 541164 -What's up, buddy?<br />-The door was right there.
541248 542290 Guys, this is Madison.
542374 543708 Yeah, you brought her last week.
543876 545752 You work at Forever 21, right?
545919 547962 -MAX: No, no.<br />-I work at Sephora.
548047 550382 -I'm confused.<br />-Different girl.
550549 551883 Same look, same voice.
552051 553135 Nice to meet you.
553302 554761 -You, too.<br />-(MADISON AND MAX CHUCKLE)
557097 558556 -That's yours.<br />-It's...
558724 560726 No. I think you're<br />supposed to kiss it, right?
560893 561935 Welcome.
562019 563478 Do you guys have a bathroom?
563645 564854 There's one just down the hall.<br />You need it?
565022 568191 Okay, is it on the right or the left?<br />I don't wanna go in the wrong room.
568358 569525 The one with the toilet.
569693 570777 -Can't miss it.<br />-Okay.
570861 572445 (BOTH LAUGH)
573572 574990 -Oh, boy.<br />-Dude!
575157 577200 -Wow. Where'd you find her? TED Talk?<br />-Right?
577367 578618 No, at Chipotle.
578786 579787 Let me ask you something, Ryan.
579870 581496 Aren't you sick of<br />losing game night every week
581580 582622 because of the dates you bring?
582790 584708 They're not always that bad.
585042 586710 (IMITATES VELOCIRAPTOR)
587878 588920 Heather, seriously.

592883 595051 Uh... "Dennis" isn't a word.
595219 597804 Uh, yeah, it is.<br />It's my daddy's name, so...
597971 600723 These are the elite,<br />the very best, the--
600808 601892 Oh, oh! White people!
601975 603559 -What?<br />-Oh, Jesus.
603644 604853 Okay, unlike you psychos,
605020 606813 I don't give a shit<br />about winning game night.
606980 608481 I don't need that validation.
608649 610859 But you do need the validation<br />of dating Instagram models?
611026 612068 Absolutely.
612236 614571 I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br />I'm not like you, Michelle.
614738 617198 We didn't all meet our soul mate<br />when we were 10 years old.
617282 618283 14.
618367 619368 -Oh, sorry.<br />-14.
619451 621161 And we didn't get married<br />until we were 19.
621245 622996 -See, that's gross.<br />-You know what, Ryan?
623080 625290 I hope one day you<br />get to meet a lovely, young lady.
625457 627750 So you can love her as much as<br />I love my sweet baby right here.
627918 629711 Yes, find her. Look how cute this...
629878 631129 -Hey, look at this.<br />-So much love.

633799 635050 Let's go play, come on.
635217 638470 Dude, do you know what rich people are<br />doing on their game nights these days?
638637 639971 What's that?
640139 641348 -(WHISPERS) Fight clubs.<br />-What?
641515 642682 I just read about them.
642850 644935 They pay poor people<br />to fight each other,
645018 646019 and then they bet on the winner.
646228 647896 -No, that's not a real thing.<br />-Yes, it is!
648063 649689 If you can have anything<br />you want in this world,
649857 651942 you have to raise the stakes,<br />or life gets boring.
652109 654236 The Kennedys used to have fight clubs<br />at their compound.
654403 657197 Honey, listen, you gotta stop reading<br />BuzzFeed every second of the damn day.
657364 658990 How about some charades?<br />Huh, should we start with charades?
659074 660075 RYAN: Let's go!<br />MICHELLE: Yeah!
660159 661326 It's been a while, huh?
661493 662869 Do you wanna wait for Brooks?
663036 664120 I don't think we need to. No, he's late.
664288 666540 -Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?<br />-MAX: Yeah.
666707 667791 I thought he was working in Europe.
667958 670335 He was, yeah. He's apparently back<br />for some business.
670502 671503 Haven't seen him yet.
671670 673838 -But we can get started.<br />-Yeah!
674006 675966 -MAX: Who wants to start?<br />-Who are you guys talking about?
676133 678760 Max's brother. He's this super<br />successful venture capitalist.
678927 681471 Yeah, he was the first to invest<br />in Panera Bread, you know?
681638 683348 The Fuji Apple Salad was his idea.
683515 684933 -A lot of investors.<br />-KEVIN: Yeah.
685100 686810 He's like the Mark Wahlberg<br />to Max's Donnie.
686894 687936 Well...
688020 689104 Which is a huge compliment
689188 691732 because Donnie was fucking great<br />in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?
691815 692899 He was.
692983 694401 Was he in The Sixth Sense?
694568 696695 He sure is, yeah.<br />You know who is not in The Sixth Sense?
696862 697988 Mark Wahlberg.
698155 700615 Mark would never take a role that small.
702284 704411 Is that right, Madison?
704578 705829 Man, I haven't seen him<br />since the wedding.
705996 707998 -Remember that speech he gave?<br />-Yes.
708165 709583 And then he paid<br />for that whole firework display!
709750 710959 -Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!<br />-Little over the top.
711043 712627 Let's get started.<br />I'm gonna start us off.

754711 755837 Mmm...
755921 757672 Still wearing the uniform.
759091 760425 Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.
760592 762594 I hope you didn't start<br />game night without me.
762678 764054 (MAX SHUSHING)
764554 765721 Did you not get my text?
765889 767307 What text?
767766 769058 Oh, hello, Officer.
770936 772604 Why's that guy staring at us?
772771 774439 Gary, I want you<br />to meet my brother, Brooks.
774606 778067 We're having a little family<br />three-man game night tonight.
778235 779486 Wait, what do you mean three-man?
779653 781154 You said that Michelle<br />and Ryan and Kevin were--
781321 782780 No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.
782948 784074 I can see them in the doorway.
784241 786117 There's a whole mess of people.<br />Hey, guys!
786285 787703 MAX: There they are.<br />RYAN: Hey!
787869 789161 These guys are leaving.
789246 790247 Take off, guys.
790330 792540 We had a little bit<br />of a mix-up with the, um...
793583 794875 -God damn it!<br />-What?
795043 796753 We didn't want him to know<br />that we're having a game night.
796920 800298 He used to come, and we don't<br />like him anymore, so...
800382 801633 Oh.
802050 803342 You know, I think he knows now.
803510 804677 He sure does.
804845 808265 Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.
808765 811517 (LAUGHS) I haven't seen you in a year!
811685 814646 Hey, you smell good.
814813 817982 What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?<br />Head and Shoulders?
818150 819776 Why do you assume<br />it's a dandruff shampoo?
819943 822195 Well, I mean, you've always<br />been a little bit of a snowstorm.
822362 823654 -Hey, would you hold that for a second?<br />-Yup.
823822 824906 Hey, guys!
825073 827617 Well, you look good, stranger.
827784 828785 It's been forever.
828952 830620 I know, and that's my fault.<br />I'm so sorry.
830954 832205 Sweet ride, Brooks.
832372 834165 Oh, you like that?<br />I just got her a couple weeks ago.
834333 835459 What is that? A Corvette?
835625 838544 It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.
838712 839921 It was my dream car as a kid.
840088 842006 And that's what<br />gave me the idea to get it.
842090 843966 You know what? I love your house.
845010 846136 Are you being sarcastic?
846303 847387 No, I mean I love your house.
847554 849180 It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.
849348 850807 Makes me think of simpler times.
850974 852308 "Simpler"?
852476 854394 Uh, so, how long are you in town for?
854478 855562 You know, I'm not sure.
855729 857105 It depends on how many clients
857189 859191 the firm's gonna be<br />having me schmooze while I'm here.
859274 860316 (BOTH LAUGHING)
860400 861442 But hopefully for a while.
861526 863819 I don't get to see you guys, and I...
865614 868158 God, I really miss you, man.<br />I really do.
868241 869825 -Oh.<br />(BROOKS SIGHS)
870452 871911 Miss you, too, Brooks.
872287 873371 RYAN: And go!
874164 875832 Shock-rocker. Dated Rose McGowan.
875916 877375 Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.
877542 878626 Yep. You got it.
878710 880628 -Quick story.<br />-There's no pausing.
880796 883340 You remember the urban myth where<br />Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out
883507 884591 so he could go down on himself?
884925 885967 ALL: Yeah.
886051 887302 You don't mind me telling the story,<br />do you, Max?
887469 888470 You're in the middle of a--
888637 890847 You were 14 years old.<br />It's an adorable story.
891014 892015 I forbid it.
892182 894350 I'm a little curious.
894518 896311 Did you blow yourself?
896603 898104 You know the bungee cords on roof racks?
898188 899189 Yeah.
899272 902316 Max took one of those bungee cords,<br />and he put it around his neck.
902484 903485 Here he goes.
903568 904860 And then he wrapped it behind his legs
904945 907238 so he could squish his face<br />down into his crotch,
907406 908907 -(ALL GASP)<br />-but the problem was
909074 911659 that it got stuck!<br />He couldn't unhook it.
912577 914620 -(ALL LAUGHING)<br />-And about an hour later
914788 917081 Mom comes home, and she finds him there.
917249 918291 KEVIN: Shit!
918458 919917 Her little pretzel boy<br />on his bedroom floor naked.
920961 922545 -(LAUGHING CONTINUES)<br />-Little pretzel boy?
922712 924588 Great story. Are we back on now?
924756 926048 So?
926341 927342 "So" what?
927509 928635 Did you suck it?
929010 930261 -(ALL LAUGHING)<br />-Let's go. Come on. Brooks.
930429 931763 Back to it. Come on. Play the game.
932597 934390 Poor man's Johnny Depp,<br />starred in Jericho.
934558 935934 Skeet Ulrich.
936435 938854 UN Secretary General '92 to '96.
939020 940062 Oh, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
940522 943316 This guy. He hated kids<br />in Jurassic Park.
943483 944484 Uh, Sam Neill.
944651 946402 Dubstep DJ, looks like Corey Feldman.
946486 947487 -Skrillex.<br />-BROOKS: Yep.
947571 949656 -Rappers love this Cubist painter.<br />-Picasso!
949823 952116 -Big cat shot by asshole dentist.<br />-KEVIN: Cecil the lion!
952284 953618 -Time!<br />-(GRUNTS)
953702 954786 -How many?<br />-KEVIN: Seven!
954870 955912 Seven!
955996 957205 (CHEERING)
958457 959666 You're up, pretzel boy.
959833 960834 ANNIE: Whoo! Go, Max!
961084 963002 -Come on, Max.<br />-All right. Here we go.
963170 964963 RYAN: And kick it. Go!
966715 967716 Oh, this is easy!
967799 971344 Annie, the famous actor that we met<br />at the airport about eight years ago.
972762 973763 Who?
973930 975765 Only actor we've ever met<br />at an airport who's famous.
976433 977559 Bobby Flay?
977726 980687 Not an actor. This fellow was<br />in front of us at the Sbarro.
980854 983106 We were wondering why he<br />wasn't in the first-class lounge.
983273 984857 Oh, yes, yes.
985358 986359 Who was that?
986526 987568 God damn it!
987652 989028 Max, there's a whole room of people<br />to help you out here.
989196 990280 -Use us.<br />-Good point.
990780 992406 (STAMMERING) He was the Incredible Hulk.
992574 993616 BOTH: Eric Bana.
993783 995701 -Other one.<br />-MICHELLE: Um, Mark Ruffalo.
995869 997203 -Other one.<br />-KEVIN: Lou Ferrigno.
997370 999372 Holy shit! Primal Fear.
999539 1001290 Richard Gere never played<br />the Incredible Hulk.
1001458 1003376 -Time.<br />-Motherfucking Ed Norton!
1003460 1004627 ALL: Oh!
1004711 1005753 Primal Fear!
1005921 1007088 Oh, my God!
1007255 1008256 RYAN: He was the Hulk.
1008340 1009924 KEVIN: The Hulk.<br />RYAN: I forgot that.
1010008 1011801 Max. Zero points.
1011968 1014804 I'd say he blew it,<br />but he won't tell us, will he?
1015013 1016347 (ALL LAUGHING)
1017432 1019183 RYAN: Shit! Did you?
1019351 1021394 I can't believe I didn't get Bob Barker.
1021561 1024647 Hey, guys! What do you say<br />we do this at my house next week?
1025023 1026107 -House? What house?<br />-Ooh. Really?
1026274 1028776 Since I don't know how long<br />I'm gonna be here, I rented a place.
1028944 1030362 It's only a couple miles away.
1030529 1031863 You know, it's up on Broadmoor.
1032030 1033489 Oh! Swanky neighborhood.
1033657 1036201 It's a very cool house,<br />but it's just me there alone.
1036368 1038286 It'd be great<br />to have you guys come over.
1038453 1042081 Oh, well, it's kind of a tradition<br />to have game nights here.
1042249 1043458 But you know what?
1043625 1045543 Let's let him show off<br />his big house, huh?
1045710 1047002 BROOKS: That's the spirit!
1047170 1048421 Trust me.
1049839 1053384 This will be a game night to remember.
1054094 1055261 -Oh, boy.<br />-Mmm.
1055345 1056387 Promise?
1056471 1058389 Good night, everybody.<br />I love you much. Drive safely.
1058557 1059683 -Kisses!<br />-All right.
1059849 1061392 KEVIN: Take it easy.<br />ALL: Bye.
1061560 1064187 That little motherfucker.
1064563 1065689 <i>Whoa!</i>
1065772 1067940 Well, I mean, come on.
1068108 1070110 We don't see him in over a year.
1070277 1072821 He shows up in your dream car,
1072988 1075865 insults our house, and then tells<br />an embarrassing story about you
1076032 1078159 right before your turn<br />just to throw you off your game.
1078326 1081037 Welcome to my whole life. Why are you<br />suddenly so worked up about it?
1081204 1082914 Well, cause now<br />he's messing with your balls
1083081 1085041 and literally killing<br />millions of our babies.
1085208 1086834 Well, that's a little dramatic,
1087002 1088962 but, yeah, you know,<br />I mean, that's Brooks.
1089129 1091172 I thought that this<br />was just regular old brother stuff,
1091339 1092506 -but I totally see it now.<br />-Mmm-mmm.
1092674 1094592 He undermines you every chance he gets.
1094676 1095802 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1095885 1097761 -It's crazy!<br />-Thank you, Annie.
1097929 1100056 You know, I've never won<br />a single game against him.
1100223 1101224 I just...
1101308 1103935 I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.
1105186 1106395 -Fix it?<br />-Yeah.
1106563 1107564 What are you suggesting?
1107731 1109816 I'm suggesting we beat his ass.
1109983 1111818 Jesus Christ.
1113194 1114945 Good evening.
1115113 1117031 -We're gonna skip the cleanup?<br />-(CHUCKLES)
1122454 1124164 Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?
1124331 1126041 No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.
1126207 1127374 -I'm gonna stay alert and ready.<br />-GARY: Evening!
1127542 1128709 -Jesus, Gary!<br />-(ANNIE GASPS)
1129753 1130920 Where are you headed?
1131087 1133714 We are going to, uh, to my brother's.
1134090 1136217 Another game night?
1136384 1138719 No. No, absolutely not.
1138887 1140471 We're going to, um,
1141389 1142431 have some dinner.
1142599 1143641 Eat.
1143767 1145185 I see.
1145518 1149230 Pity. I was going to invite you<br />over for a dinner I'm hosting.
1150065 1152901 I've purchased four lamb shanks
1153068 1157568 that I've been simmering<br />in a broth of red wine and rosemary.
1158281 1159949 That sounds so yummy, though.
1160033 1161034 Damn it.
1161117 1163327 It was actually Debbie's recipe.
1164788 1169288 I like to think she left behind her<br />recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,
1172545 1176048 but it was most likely<br />an unintentional oversight.
1181346 1184223 Well, here we go.
1185600 1186892 GARY: What?
1187977 1189144 I'm sorry?
1190230 1192023 I thought you said something.
1192315 1194108 -No.<br />-Nope, not us.
1194567 1195609 Okay.
1198530 1200156 -(CAR ENGINE STARTS)<br />-Have fun.
1203660 1205244 MAX: Oh, fuck me.
1206162 1207955 A guy who rents a house this big
1208123 1211251 must be making up for something<br />pretty small, I'd say.
1211418 1213795 No, no. No, I've seen his dick.<br />It's pretty great.
1213962 1215755 Well, I tried.
1217215 1218466 -Hey!<br />-MAX: Hey!
1218633 1219759 -ANNIE: Hey!<br />-How are you doing, beautiful?
1219926 1222345 -Good, good. Really fancy.<br />-Very nice house, Tony Stark.
1222512 1224388 Should we give<br />our drink orders to Jarvis? (CHUCKLES)
1225056 1227808 No, I got the Tony Stark part,<br />but then you went full nerd on me.
1227976 1229477 I kind of lost you,<br />but please do come in.
1229561 1230562 All right.
1230645 1231729 -Thanks, Cap.<br />-Hi, guys!
1231813 1232814 ALL: What's up?
1232897 1236358 Boy, could sleep four<br />on that couch. Look at that.
1236443 1238153 Oh, hello, friends.
1238319 1241822 Hey, let me introduce you to my date.<br />This is Sarah.
1241990 1243992 Sarah is head of company accounting<br />at our office.
1244159 1245326 Well, corporate communications.
1245493 1248412 And she's also British,<br />which means she's smart as shit.
1248580 1250290 -I'm Irish.<br />-Okay? Same island.
1250457 1251541 Well, it's really not.
1251624 1252708 -Nice to meet you. Hi.<br />-Nice to meet you, too.
1252792 1253918 -I'm Max.<br />-Annie.
1254002 1257005 So, you can't always judge a book<br />by its past covers, can you?
1257172 1259215 -ANNIE: Mmm.<br />-Almost a saying.
1259382 1260466 -Here you go.<br />-Hey, Brooks.
1260633 1262092 -Cheers.<br />-We didn't know if you had any games,
1262177 1264387 so we thought we'd bring you<br />a few of our favorites.
1264554 1266097 Hey, look at that.
1266514 1268098 -(CLATTERS)<br />-ALL: Whoa!
1268183 1269434 MAX: Huh.<br />MICHELLE: The poor games.
1269601 1271519 I told you we're taking it up a notch.
1271686 1274647 The game that we're<br />gonna play tonight is so epic
1274814 1277149 that we don't need a board,<br />and we do not need pieces.
1277317 1278860 Still didn't need to throw them<br />across the room.
1279027 1280278 I was being theatrical.
1280445 1282196 Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?
1282363 1283405 A what?
1283490 1285366 It's when rich people<br />pay poor people to fight each other--
1285533 1287868 Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.<br />Stop with the fight club, okay?
1288036 1289328 -It's nonsense.<br />-No.
1289496 1290872 Ryan believes everything he reads.
1291039 1292540 Thank you.
1292707 1295000 So, what are we playing?
1297504 1302004 In the next hour, someone in this room<br />is going to be taken.
1302342 1305303 And it's gonna be up to you to find them<br />before they are murdered.
1305470 1307430 Oh! It's a murder mystery party.
1307597 1309348 BROOKS: Not just any murder mystery.
1309516 1310975 I found this company.<br />They do it super real.
1311059 1312143 They use legit actors.
1312227 1315313 You're not gonna know<br />what's real and what's fake.
1315480 1317690 -Fun!<br />-But that's not all
1317857 1321986 because whoever finds the victim<br />wins the grand prize.
1323780 1325406 The keys to the Stingray.
1325573 1327157 -What?<br />-Wow.
1327325 1328951 Just the keys?
1329619 1331078 No, Ryan, the whole car.
1331246 1333373 Oh, yes! Oh, man!
1333540 1335041 You're so lucky I brought you<br />to this game night
1335208 1337293 -and not one of Max and Annie's.<br />-Hey!
1337460 1340045 -No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.<br />-Oh.
1340255 1342507 You're not gonna actually<br />give away your car?
1342674 1344133 Oh, it's just a tax write-off.
1344300 1346635 And the Audi, it's more practical.
1347095 1348513 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
1348680 1350765 Okay. How do we start?
1350932 1352683 We just wait for it to begin.
1352851 1355353 Maybe play a drinking game<br />to pass the time?
1355520 1357480 This group does not play drinking games.
1357647 1359690 Tonight we do, Max.
1360608 1361984 -Oh! "Never Have I Ever."<br />-RYAN: Good one!
1362151 1363443 (QUIETLY) Can you believe this guy?
1363611 1365529 (QUIETLY) Yeah, he's ridiculous.
1365697 1367156 Beautiful house, though.
1367323 1368907 Good champagne.
1372912 1374663 Here we go.
1376082 1378375 Yup. We're at the house.
1378793 1381253 We'll let you know when we have him.
1385300 1386801 (CLATTERING IN DISTANCE)
1396895 1398730 (GASPS) Jesus Christ!
1398897 1400607 What's with that knife?
1400815 1402399 It's for the cheese.
1402567 1405111 Okay, all right. Just, you know,
1405278 1407613 really aggressive way to carry a knife.
1408448 1409449 Oh, no, I've got one.
1409616 1413119 Never have I ever<br />connected my work computer
1413286 1416664 to the projector in the conference room<br />when it was open on a WebMD page
1416831 1417915 for chlamydia symptoms.
1418082 1419124 RYAN: That's not cool!
1419292 1420418 SARAH: Drink!
1420543 1422419 Just for the record,<br />I did not have chlamydia.
1422587 1425423 It was pubic dermatitis. You get it<br />from not washing your crotch, so...
1425590 1426591 ANNIE: Okay.<br />MAX: Good for you.
1426799 1428884 I... I like her.
1429260 1431136 And, listen, you're not supposed<br />to single people out in this game.
1431304 1433472 It's supposed to be generic things, like
1433640 1435391 "Never have I ever slept<br />with a celebrity."
1435558 1437393 Oh, I didn't know. Okay.
1437477 1438603 BROOKS: Whoops.
1438686 1439770 -SARAH: Mmm?<br />-Ooh.
1439854 1441105 (KEVIN CHUCKLES)
1442941 1443983 What?
1444067 1445860 You slept with a celebrity?
1446027 1448654 No, I was taking a drink<br />separate from the game.
1448738 1449780 -That was bad timing.<br />-MAX: Mmm.
1449864 1451448 I see how you would think, but it's not.
1451616 1454118 Well, then why are you breathing<br />like you just got off the elliptical?
1454786 1456496 I'm not. I'm...
1456913 1459206 (SCOFFS) Come on, babe.<br />Whose turn is it?
1459332 1461625 Uh, it's Max. Max, it's your turn. Huh?
1461793 1463669 I'm not playing a drinking game.<br />Who was it?
1463836 1464837 What's the deal with that?
1464921 1465963 They've been together<br />since middle school.
1466130 1467131 MICHELLE: It's somebody else's turn.
1467215 1468216 -Oh. Oh!<br />-Yeah!
1468299 1470175 How could you possibly<br />have had sex with a celebrity
1470343 1472219 when we've only had sex with each other?
1472387 1474514 Please, can you not make this<br />one of your things right now?
1474681 1475807 How is this one of my things?
1476641 1479518 Yeah, Brooks, this is why<br />we don't play drinking games.
1479602 1480603 (POUNDING ON DOOR)
1482647 1484398 It looks like the game is afoot.
1484482 1485774 Oh!
1485858 1487359 -Thank you, God!<br />-(SCOFFS)
1487527 1489487 MAX: Oh, boy. Let's buckle up, huh?
1491698 1493199 Brooks Davis?
1493491 1494533 Yes.
1494617 1496201 -Oh, shit.<br />-ALL: Ooh!
1496369 1497787 This is good.
1498496 1500331 Agent Henderson.
1501124 1502166 FBI.
1502333 1505044 Sunglasses at night. It's legit.
1505211 1506295 Sit down, please.
1507505 1509048 I'll get right to the point.
1509215 1513715 The Bureau has been tracking a ring<br />of violent kidnappers
1514137 1516222 in this very neighborhood.
1516973 1520309 And we have reason to believe<br />that one of you
1521602 1523103 may be their next victim.
1523187 1524438 (RYAN LAUGHS EXCITEDLY)
1525106 1526190 -(CHUCKLES)<br />-MAX: That's terrible news.
1526357 1529651 Contained within these dossiers
1529819 1533447 are the clues you will require<br />to find the kidnappers.
1533614 1535574 You'd like for us to do that, yeah?
1536117 1537952 The Bureau's...<br />What's the Bureau's role in this?
1538119 1539870 Maybe you guys could take my wife<br />in for questioning
1540038 1541706 because, apparently, she got a<br />secret life I don't know nothing about.
1541789 1544082 -Baby, this is--<br />-Shut up, all of you!
1544167 1545334 Wow.
1546878 1548588 It's not a joke.
1548755 1551466 You people are in real danger,<br />and you're running out of time.
1551632 1555385 And I, Agent Henderson,<br />will not stand idly by
1555553 1559682 while innocent civilians<br />are slaughtered on my watch.
1559849 1560933 (LAUGHING) I told you<br />this is gonna be great.
1561100 1562976 -It's so good!<br />-So good.
1563144 1564145 But, uh, before we get started,
1564312 1566397 I'm required to ask if any of you<br />have any food allergies.
1567023 1568065 Peanuts?
1569067 1570234 Who the hell are you?
1570318 1571402 -(GROANS)<br />-Oh!
1571486 1573070 Now wait a second.<br />I know you're method and all,
1573237 1575447 but you can't just come in here<br />and break the door. (GROANS)
1575573 1577616 -(GUESTS EXCLAIM)<br />- I do not mind this game.
1577784 1579368 -Are you crazy?<br />-(GRUNTS)
1580787 1583122 (BOTH GRUNTING)
1594342 1596135 It's very well done.
1597386 1598553 No!
1599222 1600848 That is a strong table.
1602016 1603434 Oh, watch out! He's packing heat!
1603601 1604643 Hell no!
1606562 1608605 (GRUNTING CONTINUES)
1608689 1609856 (KIDNAPPER YELLING)

1649939 1652483 KIDNAPPER: You're just making this<br />harder on yourself!
1653609 1655485 (ALL GRUNTING)
1655570 1656571 KIDNAPPER: Oh, shit!
1657488 1659907 Guys, make sure you<br />get a piece of this cheese. It's just...
1660074 1662409 -Cut me one.<br />-Try it with the quince.
1663327 1665329 (ALL GRUNTING)
1670126 1671502 -SARAH: Oh, my God!<br />-(GROANS)
1672128 1673170 Now he's back.
1673254 1674421 KIDNAPPER: Stop fighting, asshole!
1674589 1675715 Help me! This isn't--
1675798 1678175 The Independent Spirit Award goes to...
1678384 1679551 -KIDNAPPER: Let's go!<br />-(MUFFLED SCREAMING)
1680344 1681345 Bye-bye!
1681512 1683096 First one that follows us gets shot!
1683264 1684932 Okay, roger that. You drive safe.
1685099 1686725 KIDNAPPER: Come on, motherfucker!
1687101 1689269 -That was amazing.<br />-Really good.
1689437 1690771 -That was really good.<br />-Wow.
1691022 1695026 Mmm. No, there's something about this<br />that just doesn't feel right.
1695568 1697820 How could you cheat on me<br />with a celebrity?
1697987 1699029 I didn't cheat on you.
1699197 1701699 It was before we got married<br />when we took that break.
1701866 1704118 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1704285 1705286 I've been living in The Matrix.
1705453 1708456 Agent Henderson,<br />you just gonna keep lying there?
1708623 1709624 KEVIN: Is any of this real?
1709790 1711416 Well, don't kick him!
1712001 1714003 -MICHELLE: Stop.<br />-He's a regular Daniel Day-Lewis.
1714170 1715212 KEVIN: I thought we both agreed
1715296 1718173 that we wouldn't hook up<br />with anybody else during that break.
1718341 1720676 Yeah, but then you went<br />and got a hand job from Karen Waller.
1720843 1722511 KEVIN: No, don't do that.<br />RYAN: Boop! Boop! Boop!
1722678 1724554 Because it was over the pants,<br />all right?
1724722 1728058 It was, and it hurt. It was very dry,<br />and I didn't climax.
1728226 1729769 Just admit it.<br />You guys did more than that.
1729936 1731854 Don't turn this around on me.<br />Do not do that.
1732021 1733188 Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!
1733522 1734523 Damn it, they got the jump on us.
1734607 1735608 -Come on.<br />-Shit, Kev!
1735691 1736692 Come on now!
1736776 1738527 All right. Here's the first clue.<br />Looks like a riddle.
1738611 1740070 "With shiny fangs..."
1740238 1741864 "My bloodless bite..."
1742031 1744825 "Will bring together<br />what's mostly white."
1744992 1746785 Donald Trump.
1746953 1750748 "Bloodless bite." It's not a vampire.<br />Um...
1750915 1752249 I'll just Google it.
1752416 1753583 It's so inconsistent, isn't it?
1753668 1755419 I mean, they stage<br />this super realistic fight.
1755586 1758422 They give us an FBI dossier<br />but with riddles.
1758589 1760382 It's like, let's pick a tone.<br />Let's stick with it.
1760549 1762300 But that's the game.<br />You wanna win this car or not?
1762468 1763886 Yeah, yeah. More than anything,
1764053 1765554 but I feel like Brooks is setting me up.
1765721 1767055 Do you get that feeling? You know,
1767223 1770726 that this is some game<br />where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?
1772478 1773937 Mmm-hmm.
1774814 1776941 Well, let's not play by his rules.
1778359 1779860 "My bloodless bite, my bloodless,<br />bloodless bite.
1780027 1781987 "Bloodless bite, bloodless bite,<br />bloodless bite."
1782154 1784406 Can you stop chanting "bloodless bite"?<br />It's just...
1784949 1786951 -Trying to think.<br />-Yeah.
1787493 1789995 -(CAR ENGINE STARTS)<br />-Oh, shit!
1790538 1792665 Max and Annie must have figured it out.
1792832 1795042 Right. We need to find an advantage.
1795418 1798838 Advantage, advantage, advantage...
1799130 1800131 Brooks' wallet?
1800298 1802425 You think we should steal<br />all of his shit!
1803009 1804010 No.
1805052 1806219 (DIALING CELL PHONE)
1808472 1810474 Hi, yeah. I lost my credit card.
1810558 1812351 I was wondering if you could tell me<br />what the last few charges I made were.
1812518 1813602 What are you doing?
1813769 1815353 If we can find out the name<br />of the murder mystery place he used,
1815521 1817606 we can go to their office and<br />pay them off to give us the final clue.
1817773 1819149 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1819317 1823446 You're, like, a double threat.<br />Brains and you're British.
1824447 1825614 Thanks.
1825781 1830281 Okay. What has shiny fangs<br />that bites white things together?
1831370 1832371 A stapler!
1832538 1834498 And the white things are paper.
1834665 1837584 Yes! You are so smart and unfaithful!
1837835 1838877 Oh, there it is.
1839045 1840171 Yes!
1841297 1843007 Look at that.
1843174 1844967 -Flash drive.<br />-Put it in the desktop.
1847261 1848262 Okay.
1849138 1850180 KEVIN: Another riddle.
1850348 1853559 “I'm brown and old by day,<br />white and young by night.
1853726 1854727 "My eyes are glass.
1854894 1856770 "I have nine faces but no head.
1856937 1858647 "I sing to the sky but have no voice.
1858814 1861399 “I'm everywhere and nowhere."
1863110 1864986 What the fuck is that?
1865071 1866280 (MAX LAUGHS)
1866364 1867698 I mean, how cool are we?
1867865 1869199 -Very, very cool. We are very cool.<br />-Right?
1869367 1872703 You're the cool one. You know,<br />tracking the phone is just a great idea.
1872870 1874162 Still on Route 18, huh?
1874330 1876332 MAX: We're catching up to them.<br />Here we come, Brooksie.
1876499 1879210 Can you imagine the look on his face<br />when we find him so fast?
1879377 1882755 You know, baby, I can feel my sperm<br />already coming back to life.
1882922 1884089 -Perfect.<br />-Yeah.
1884256 1887384 So we'll win your brother's car,<br />and then we'll go make a baby in it.
1887551 1889469 -Yeah! We'll make him watch us. Huh?<br />-Yeah.
1890429 1892347 -I don't wanna do that.<br />-No, me neither.
1892515 1893766 -Sorry, don't know why I said that.<br />-I'm not into that.
1893933 1895476 -Not a great idea.<br />-Okay.
1895643 1896894 Okay, great. Thank you.
1897061 1898312 All right, I got the name<br />and the address of the games company.
1898479 1899688 -Let's go.<br />-Yes!
1899855 1902774 All we have to do now,<br />figure out what "bloodless bite" means.
1903317 1904568 No, we don't. That's why...
1906028 1908488 -Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.<br />-Doesn't matter. Let's go.
1908656 1910199 How you gonna be old and young?
1910366 1912117 -That doesn't make sense.<br />-I know.
1912284 1914786 Guys, hey, how's it goin'?
1914954 1918082 I just wanted to wish you<br />the best of luck tonight. Bye.
1921043 1922252 BOTH: No.<br />KEVIN: Mmm-mmm.
1922420 1923754 What are... What are you doing?

1931053 1933430 God damn it!
1934557 1936976 Baby, hand me those matches.<br />I'm about to burn this door down.
1937143 1939562 You're gonna light a fire in<br />a windowless room that we're trapped in?
1939728 1942188 You slept with Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br />He talked to you about flames?
1942356 1943440 What about that?
1957830 1959623 Where could he be?
1960040 1962500 His phone stopped right here, huh?
1962585 1964628 (CELL PHONE RINGING)
1964962 1966213 -Hear that?<br />-Yeah.
1967006 1968007 (GASPS)
1968090 1969174 Ugh.
1969383 1970467 Found it!
1970634 1972093 He must've known we were tracking him.
1972261 1973804 Well, they outsmarted us.
1975806 1976807 Hang on.
1977391 1978600 (ANNIE GASPS)
1978726 1980352 Isn't that one of the actors?
1980769 1982854 MAX: Guess they're not<br />So smart after all, huh?
1983022 1985899 Guess not. We are nailing this!
1987109 1988151 (WHISPERS) Why are we crouching?
1988319 1990529 (WHISPERS) I don't know. It feels right.
1994283 1995951 Oh, it's horrible in here.
1996118 1998829 -Yeah, it's sticky. Shoes are shot.<br />-Ugh.
1999497 2001248 Ooh. There he is. There he is.<br />Don't let him see you. Come on.
2001415 2002707 Sit down right here.
2002875 2005168 Bartender, sir,<br />can I ask you a question?
2005252 2006336 Um...
2006545 2007671 You, um...
2007755 2009965 You didn't happen to see a fellow<br />brought in here,
2010132 2011341 looks a little bit like me,
2011509 2013761 but he's got a little bit<br />of a sharper chin
2013928 2015179 and higher cheekbones?
2015346 2017056 So a better-looking guy?
2017389 2019224 No, well, I wouldn't call it that.
2019475 2020976 I didn't see nothing.
2022436 2024146 -Oh, boy. You hear that?<br />-Huh. Yeah.
2024313 2025564 That double negative?<br />"Didn't see nothing"?
2025731 2027357 -It's a little forced, right?<br />-Yeah, I think he's in on it.
2027525 2028776 -'Course he is.<br />-Look at those tats.
2028943 2030694 So fresh, probably fake.
2031237 2033447 Tell you what.<br />Let's give him a test, okay?
2033614 2036325 Let's order a couple of drinks that only<br />a real bartender would know how to make.
2036408 2037450 Oh, smart! Yes.
2037535 2038953 -Sir! Excuse me. Hi.<br />-Barkeep.
2039119 2040495 MAX: Totally forgot to order drinks.
2040663 2041789 Yes, uh...
2042414 2045208 Could I please have a vodka tonic?
2047002 2048044 Well done, honey.
2048212 2050464 I'm gonna have a Harvey Wallbanger.
2050631 2052591 Okay? Appreciate it.
2053217 2054760 Jesus! Did you see that look?
2054927 2055969 Guy doesn't know what's going on.
2056136 2057178 Think you stumped him.
2057346 2059222 Regional theater hack.
2059306 2060724 -(LAUGHS)<br />-Huh?
2061183 2063643 -Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?<br />-Yeah.
2063811 2064812 It's nice to get out of the house.
2064979 2067231 You know, we're not gonna be able<br />to do stuff like this if we have kids.
2067898 2068940 -What?<br />-Yeah.

2070401 2071860 I was thinking about it.<br />Remember Dan and Linda?
2072027 2073987 Remember how much time<br />we used to spend with them?
2074154 2076948 Just tons of fun.<br />And then they had those twins.
2077116 2078492 Boom! Off the grid, right?
2078659 2080744 Last time we saw them<br />was their Christmas card
2080828 2081829 with the wonky kids on it.
2081996 2084790 Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.<br />They look so happy.
2084873 2086082 But you know what I mean.

2115154 2116488 -Let's go.<br />-Yeah, probably.
2116655 2119532 But that's why I brought this.
2119700 2121201 Jesus Christ, honey!<br />Where did you get a gun?
2121368 2123578 No, no, that's the fake gun<br />from Brooks' fight.
2123746 2126123 -Oh, yeah. Boy, that looks real.<br />-Yeah, well, you know...

2375497 2376581 Really? Thank you.

2721927 2724888 I buy and I sell illegal shit for people<br />in the black market.
2724971 2726222 Really? So you're a criminal?
2726306 2727432 Oh, my God! They're following us!
2729309 2730601 But I made a mistake,<br />because there's this guy.
2730685 2731686 They call him the Bulgarian.
2731770 2734063 He's got his fingers in all these pies<br />around the world.
2734231 2736233 -What kind of pies?<br />-illegal pies, Max.
2736316 2739068 You know, the kind of pies that have<br />heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.
2739152 2740153 You know, all that kind of stuff.
2740237 2742989 But he just wanted me to help him<br />find this Faberge egg.
2743073 2745450 Fuck that! Faberge egg?
2745533 2746992 -Are you kidding me?<br />-No, I'm serious.
2747077 2748078 And I found it!
2748161 2750788 But then there was this other guy,<br />this Marlon Freeman.
2750872 2752957 He's willing to pay twice as much<br />for the same egg.
2753041 2754500 So what? So you screwed over<br />the Bulgarian guy
2754584 2755876 and those fellows behind us<br />work for him,
2755961 2757712 and they just happen to crash your<br />murder mystery party?
2757796 2760089 I know, right?<br />What are the odds of that?
2761549 2762800 -Oh, too close, too close!<br />-Careful, careful!
2765053 2766262 Watch out! Watch out!
2766346 2767347 Oh, oh!
2770058 2771267 -Shit!<br />-Sorry! You okay?
2771434 2772476 Yeah, I'm all right.
2772560 2774979 -We need to go to the cops now!<br />-Yeah, right now! Let's go!
2775146 2776230 -We can't go to the cops!<br />-MAX: Why?
2776398 2777690 The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.
2777857 2778941 On his face?
2780652 2781944 No, in the police department.
2782112 2783446 Look out!
2784823 2786199 -Careful!<br />-(HORNS BLARING)
2790787 2792205 Oh, my God! This is insane!
2806636 2808929 If you call the cops,<br />I'll be dead before I get to jail.
2809097 2810598 Why don't we just get a hold<br />of this Marlon Freeman guy
2810682 2811766 and buy the egg back from him?
2811850 2813935 I couldn't find him if I wanted to.<br />That name's an alias.
2817939 2819565 -Gun, gun, gun! Duck!<br />-Oh, oh...
2829617 2831660 Okay, these guys are not stopping.<br />What do we do?
2831828 2834914 They're not gonna stop<br />until they get me.
2835081 2836999 I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this.
2837083 2838084 ANNIE: Oh, my God!
2838251 2840461 I'm sorry for a lot of things.
2842797 2843881 -Hey! What are you doing?<br />-What is he doing? What is he doing?
2845759 2847761 -I love you, Max!<br />-Brooks, don't be an idiot!
2848636 2849637 (GRUNTING)
2850305 2851306 MAX: Stop the car!
2857979 2859397 (BROOKS GROANING)
2860065 2862525 -Shit! Go, go, go!<br />-Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
2865987 2868155 Fuck! What are we gonna do?<br />They're gonna kill my brother.
2868323 2869907 Oh, Annie, I feel faint.<br />I'm gonna pass out.
2870075 2871868 Oh, honey, we'll get you<br />to a hospital, okay?
2872035 2873327 No, no, no! No hospitals.
2873495 2874746 This is a gunshot wound,<br />they'll call the cops.
2874829 2875830 Shit, shit! Okay.
2875914 2878458 So we go to a mob doctor, right?
2879501 2880835 Do you know one of those, sweetheart?
2881002 2882712 -No.<br />-No.
2882879 2884589 What about a veterinarian<br />that works for the mob?
2885131 2886841 -You know one of those?<br />-No.
2887008 2888426 Come on. Why are you pitching<br />all the mob stuff?
2888593 2890720 - I think 'cause I'm losing my shit here!<br />- I get it.
2890887 2891929 You're gonna have to do it.
2892013 2893014 -What?<br />-Yup.
2893098 2894182 You're gonna have<br />to take the bullet out.
2894349 2895475 I don't wanna... I don't wanna do it.
2895642 2896726 You think I want you<br />to take the bullet out?
2896893 2899145 I've seen you try to cut a chicken.<br />We have no other option.
2899312 2901731 (SOBS) Oh, my God! This is so bad!
2901898 2903441 I hate game night!
2907028 2908362 -Thank you!<br />-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
2909948 2910949 Hey!
2911032 2912700 Oh, thank God.<br />Listen, Annie. It's all real.
2912784 2913785 Oh, no, I know.
2913868 2915494 Brooks is caught up in something and...
2915662 2917038 Okay, where are you guys?
2917122 2918706 We're all at Brooks'.<br />Waiting to talk to the cops.
2918790 2921042 No! No, no, no! Do not talk to the cops!
2921209 2922251 What? Why? What's going on?
2922419 2923670 -Are you guys okay?<br />-Yeah, yeah.
2923837 2926005 We're fine. We're fine.<br />I shot Max, but he's fine.
2926089 2927090 What?
2927173 2928507 Look. We will meet you<br />back at our house.
2928591 2930426 Whatever you do,<br />do not tell the cops anything.
2930510 2932803 Brooks's life depends on it.
2937475 2938893 -Hey.
2939060 2940186 Okay.
2940353 2941395 I got a bunch of stuff.
2941479 2942480 Yeah.
2943022 2945232 Pocket knife. Tweezers.
2945316 2946775 Sewing kit. Gauze.
2946860 2948319 Good, good. All right.<br />Wow, you did great!
2948486 2950905 Yeah.<br />And they didn't have rubbing alcohol.
2951072 2953866 And they don't sell hard liquor,<br />so I got you this lovely chard.
2954033 2956160 Good idea. Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.
2956327 2958203 What else did you get, huh?<br />More good stuff?
2958746 2960998 What is helpful in Country Living?
2961166 2964919 Oh, that's for later. There's a corn<br />chowder recipe. It looks really good.
2965086 2966921 -You love corn chowder, huh?<br />-Sweet. I do, yeah.
2967088 2968172 -That'll cheer you up.<br />-Thank you.
2968256 2969715 Okay. And then a squeaky toy.
2970258 2971259 -Huh.<br />-For your mouth.
2971426 2972427 -For the pain.<br />-Mmm-hmm.
2972594 2974095 Okay. Well, hopefully I won't need this.
2974262 2976097 -Okay, let's see this bad boy.<br />-All right.
2976264 2977348 Yeah, careful.
2977515 2979141 -Okay.<br />-All right.
2979225 2980309 -(ANNIE INHALES SHARPLY)<br />-(MAX GROANS)
2980393 2981394 -Okay.<br />-Okay.
2981561 2982562 -We're gonna push past it.<br />-No problem. No problem.
2982729 2983813 -We're gonna get the bullet out.<br />-Let's just Google.
2983980 2985272 Honey, can you return the text later?
2985440 2987191 This is instructions<br />on how to remove a bullet.
2988109 2989652 -Oh, sorry.<br />-It's an alt-right militia website,
2989819 2991445 so I'm just gonna<br />ignore the racist stuff.
2991613 2992697 -Good. Good, good.<br />-Yeah?
2992864 2994323 Okay. "Step one, sterile gloves."
2994741 2995992 Check!
2996159 2997201 We're doing the best we can, right?
2997368 2999078 Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.
2999245 3000746 "Step two."
3000830 3003457 Um... Okay. "Disinfect wound."
3003625 3005585 Right, yeah.<br />That's gonna sting, isn't it?
3005668 3007086 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
3007170 3008462 -Let's do it.<br />-Okay?
3008796 3010255 -(MUFFLED GROANS)<br />(TOY SQUEAKING)
3010340 3012550 That smarts, huh?
3012717 3014468 -Yeah.<br />-(WHIMPERS)
3014636 3016596 Gonna administer anesthetic.
3016763 3018765 -We don't have that.<br />-Just gonna skip that one. Okay.
3018932 3020516 "Step four,<br />apply pressure above the wound."
3020683 3022601 Here, you squeeze that there.
3022685 3023727 - I got it.<br />-Great. Thank you.
3023811 3026355 We're just gonna<br />make two tiny incisions...
3026439 3027940 -Oh, my God.<br />-On either side of the wound.
3028024 3030234 Easy-peasy. Huh?
3030527 3031736 This is fun, huh?
3031819 3033695 -Are you having fun?<br />-No.
3033780 3034864 Let's get the bullet.
3034948 3036324 -Okay. Here we go.<br />-Let's get in there and get it.
3036407 3038534 -Nice and small, nice and small, baby.<br />-Okay. Yeah, yeah.
3038618 3039660 Tiny, teeny.
3039911 3041495 (TOY SQUEAKING)
3043456 3045749 That's not small. That's really big!
3045917 3046959 So big?
3047043 3049170 Way too big, baby.<br />It's a bullet, not a grapefruit.
3049254 3051381 I'm sorry! I'm sorry.<br />This is my first time. I don't know...
3051464 3052965 Oh, there's so much blood.
3053091 3054217 (GAGGING)
3054300 3057469 No, no. Don't you start doing that.<br />No, you're gonna make... (GAGS)
3057971 3059597 (BOTH GAGGING)
3060974 3062016 -I'm sorry.<br />-Stop it.
3062100 3063476 I'm looking at you,<br />and you're making me...
3063560 3064936 Well, don't look at me.<br />I won't look at it.
3065019 3066770 -Push through. Let's go.<br />-Okay. All right, okay.
3066854 3067855 -No more cutting.<br />-Oh, shit.
3067939 3069023 Just get the tweezers<br />and get the bullet out, baby.
3069107 3070358 Shit, shit, shit. Um...
3070441 3072568 -What? What happened?<br />-Phone went to sleep.
3072652 3073861 You gotta set it so that thing stays on.
3073945 3075112 -No. My phone doesn't do that.<br />-Sure it does.
3075196 3076530 Same phone as mine. Just change it.
3076614 3078866 Just gonna touch it with my nose<br />every 30 seconds. It's fine.
3078950 3080368 Don't be afraid of your phone.<br />Get in there, go to the settings,
3080451 3083120 go to "Display" and change the timing<br />so that it doesn't revert to sleep mode.
3083204 3084246 -Revert?<br />-Yeah.
3084330 3085914 What are you, Steve Jobs?<br />I'm not reverting anything. No.
3085999 3087041 No, I'm just<br />unafraid of my phone, honey.
3087125 3088126 It's so fucking simple.
3088585 3090336 Shh! Quiet. I know what I'm doing, okay?
3090503 3091712 Do you?
3091796 3092797 Yes.
3093006 3094757 -Here we go. Here we go.<br />-Here she goes.
3094924 3096383 You're like a dolphin.
3096551 3098261 All right. This part's gonna hurt.
3098428 3099595 I don't... I don't doubt it.
3099762 3101138 Okay, let's do this.
3101598 3102599 -(EXHALES)<br />-Okay.
3102682 3103683 (GASPS)
3103766 3104975 Ooh... Oh, wait.
3105518 3106519 -(CLICKING SOUND)<br />-What is that?
3106894 3107895 You hear that?
3107979 3109522 What's that sound? What's that sound?
3109606 3110857 Is that the bullet?
3110982 3113275 -(GASPS) That's bone!<br />-What?
3113359 3114902 That's not right.
3115361 3119198 Okay. Um, what do the racists say<br />if you can't find the bullet?
3119282 3120616 Yeah, that's bone. You got the bone.
3120700 3122702 I'm looking at my bone. Look right here.
3122869 3125955 (GASPS) Max, did you get shot twice?
3127081 3128248 (SIGHS)
3129167 3130293 That's the exit wound.
3130793 3132336 Oh, it came out!
3132420 3133921 Yup. Nothing to remove.
3134088 3135297 The bullet has exited the arm.
3135381 3136590 Well, let's just sew<br />that sucker up, huh?
3136674 3137675 Yeah.
3139969 3142596 No, no. Honey, don't, don't look at...
3142680 3143722 -(GAGS)<br />-Stop it.
3143806 3145933 (BOTH GAGGING)
3146100 3147184 ANNIE: I'm sorry.
3147518 3149978 Now, the Bulgarian's guys have Brooks,<br />and the only way to save him
3150146 3152398 is to get that egg<br />from this Marlon Freeman guy.
3152482 3155067 I can't believe your brother's been<br />lying to us this whole time.
3155151 3156861 He's even cooler than we thought.
3156944 3159363 Honey, I think you sewed my arm<br />to my sleeve.
3159447 3161574 I didn't even know<br />Morgan Freeman collected Fabergé eggs.
3161658 3163451 Aren't those worth millions of dollars?
3163534 3165494 It's Marlon Freeman,<br />but that's just an alias.
3165578 3167621 Somehow, we gotta find out<br />his real name, find out his address.
3167705 3169873 -Police computer.<br />-MAX: What do you mean?
3169957 3172042 I once dated this girl<br />whose father was a cop.
3172126 3174086 She showed me her dad's police computer.
3174170 3176964 It has a database with<br />every known alias on it.
3177048 3179675 I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'<br />real name on it.
3179759 3182303 So, if we called her up, would she<br />let you go on her dad's computer?
3182387 3184722 No. No. No way! That ended badly.
3185014 3187808 So how are we gonna get into a police<br />computer without the cops knowing?
3187892 3189184 -Billy Bob Thornton!<br />-MICHELLE: What?
3189268 3191311 -What?<br />-You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?
3191396 3195775 Hang on. Hang on. I know<br />where we can get on a police computer.
3196859 3199111 -Hey!<br />-ALL: Gary!
3199487 3200779 Goodness.
3201489 3203449 To what do<br />Bastian and I owe the pleasure?
3203616 3204992 Well, we were all just talking,
3205159 3207911 and we realized<br />we haven't had a game night in ages,
3208079 3209622 just the seven of us.
3209706 3210707 So...
3210790 3212750 I thought you were going<br />to your brother's house.
3212834 3214001 I never said that.
3214085 3216212 Come on, Gare Bear.<br />Live a little! It's the weekend!
3216295 3219381 We were just saying how you were always<br />better at games than Debbie was.
3219465 3221675 I'll thank you<br />not to besmirch my ex-wife.
3222135 3223594 That woman is an angel.
3223678 3227932 Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games<br />than you.
3228474 3232974 I will admit I have eagerly awaited<br />a visit such as this.
3240570 3241821 Where'd he go?
3242488 3243989 Do we follow him?
3244073 3245282 MAX: It seems like it.
3245366 3246992 -Ryan, you go first.<br />-I'm scared.
3253750 3256252 Help yourself to popped corn<br />with sea salt.
3256335 3258170 Oh! Oh!
3259046 3260505 (GROANS) Yummy, yummy.
3261048 3263633 I can't believe that you read my mind.<br />I was craving popcorn.
3263801 3266136 You have a framed photo of game night?
3266304 3270099 Doesn't everyone have photographs<br />of their best friends in their homes?
3271601 3273978 ANNIE: Of course. We do.
3274562 3276313 Max, uh, you wanna go first?
3276397 3278273 Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.
3278900 3280109 Oh. There's a loose one.
3280193 3282612 Always in the middle.<br />That's where you wanna go.
3282695 3284071 Can I use your john real quick?
3284155 3286574 Of course.<br />It's the end of the hall, next to our...
3287742 3289952 (BREATHES DEEPLY)
3290119 3291829 My bedroom.
3293331 3294373 Okay.
3316896 3318564 Oh, no, Gary.
3346217 3349720 So, Sarah, how long have you two<br />been a couple?
3350555 3353057 Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...
3353140 3356268 We work together. I wouldn't, um...<br />I wouldn't do that thing.
3356352 3360852 I see. I thought I detected a certain<br />chemistry between the two of you.
3361941 3364526 -(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)<br />-No. No way.
3365152 3367320 -No, that's not...<br />-Mmm. Mmm.
3367655 3371283 Then again, I'm not the best judge<br />of chemistry in the world. (CHUCKLES)
3371784 3373327 (ALL CHUCKLE AWKWARDLY)
3379250 3380417 Hmm.
3381002 3382670 Oh, because your wife left you.
3383254 3384463 KEVIN: Oh, shit.
3394181 3396349 Hello, Donald Anderton.

3408029 3412529 So many possible moves.<br />I just don't know where to begin.
3414577 3416120 Um, maybe... Ooh...
3417455 3418914 -Decision-making.<br />-Come on, Annie. Just make up your mind.
3419081 3420624 -No!<br />-Please! No?
3422877 3425796 Yup, take your time.
3433930 3435765 (SNIFFING)
3457870 3460664 Oh, Brooks. What have you<br />gotten yourself into?
3477974 3482019 Oh, shit. Where did you<br />come from, little guy??
3483396 3487274 Son of a bitch.<br />Hey! What are you, a vampire?
3487525 3490152 Oh, God. Oh, God.
3493030 3496408 Oh, my God. Has that got it?
3496575 3500453 No, that doesn't got it.<br />God damn it. Come on!
3504959 3505960 No!
3507837 3508838 I should go check on him.
3508921 3510213 -(ALL EXCLAIM)<br />- I think he's fine.
3510548 3513551 -He cried out.<br />-SARAH: Tell me about Debbie.
3516387 3517638 I beg your pardon.
3518347 3522847 Oh, just ... I never met her.<br />I'd love to hear all about her.
3533779 3535238 Where do I begin?
3535406 3537991 All right, you wanna take a bath?<br />We'll take a little bath.
3538159 3542659 There we go. Okay.<br />All right. Here we go.
3545207 3548043 There we go, huh? Huh?
3549503 3550712 Oh, it's so much worse.
3551380 3554841 Oh, God. And what did I do to this?<br />What the fuck is this thing?
3556343 3557469 Oh, Debbie.
3557553 3558762 Oh!
3566312 3568772 Okay. Fuck this.
3569356 3571191 Hey, guys, Gary was right.<br />It's awful late.
3571275 3573610 Let's get home, get to bed, huh?<br />Get out of his hair.
3573694 3575862 We haven't finished the game.<br />It's your turn, Max.
3576030 3577281 Oh, my turn, huh?
3577448 3579950 Okay, be careful now, Max.<br />Oh! (GROANS)
3580034 3581744 Well, game over. I went in a little hot.
3581911 3584830 -GARY: Why did you--<br />-Thanks! Good to see you, Gary.
3584997 3587124 When shall we play next?
3587208 3590211 ANNIE: (STAMMERS) Soon. We'll call you.
3591045 3592046 (DOOR CLOSES)
3595049 3597926 Bastian. Baby!
3598344 3599595 -(CELL PHONE RINGING)<br />-(KEVIN SIGHS)
3599678 3603723 So, how are we supposed to get this egg<br />out of Donald Anderton's house?
3603808 3605434 I don't know. I'm gonna figure it out.
3606519 3609146 "Unknown Caller." Please don't be Gary.
3609230 3611857 -Hello?<br />-MAN: (DISTORTED) We have your brother.
3612733 3613859 Um...
3613943 3615486 Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,
3615569 3616695 and we're actually<br />on our way there right now.
3616779 3618489 We can do a swap, okay?<br />Please don't hurt Brooks.
3618572 3622492 Meet us on the East 4th Street bridge<br />at midnight. If you're late, he dies.
3622576 3623994 -Oh, my God.<br />-Um...
3624578 3627122 Boy, that's less than an hour from now.
3628541 3629625 Hello?
3629708 3632877 What's up with this guy's voice?<br />He sounds like a monster.
3633045 3634796 He's using a voice changer, Ryan.
3634880 3637215 He still sounds like a scary monster.
3640511 3644264 KEVIN: And we are here.
3644890 3645891 All right. You guys head home,
3645975 3647226 and I will call as soon<br />as I get the egg, all right?
3647309 3649477 What? Wait a second. Wait.<br />I'm going with you.
3649645 3651647 No, Annie. It could be very, very<br />dangerous in there, okay?
3651730 3653940 Listen, Brooks shouldn't have<br />dragged any of us into this,
3654024 3655734 but he is my brother,<br />and it's up to me to fix it.
3655818 3657861 No, bullshit!<br />We're all in this together!
3657945 3660072 No, no, no. Max is right.<br />You guys should go home,
3660239 3662449 but you and I are doing this.
3662616 3664951 Okay, what happens<br />if you guys don't make it out?
3665035 3667328 We don't come to game night because<br />we're dying to play charades and shit.
3667413 3668664 We come because we |love you guys.
3668747 3670874 Honestly, this is<br />the best part of our week.
3670958 3674127 Mine, too. And I have<br />a lot of options on the weekend.
3674211 3676296 Wow. You guys...
3676380 3678382 Thank you. That's very nice.
3679133 3680926 Aw, good friends.
3681594 3684847 You should probably go, though, right?<br />I mean, you don't even know us.
3685222 3686806 Yeah, why are you still here?
3686891 3690227 Oh, I don't know.<br />I just got caught up in it.
3690311 3692313 Also, if I go home now,
3692396 3694147 and then I read in the newspaper<br />tomorrow that you all died,
3694231 3698193 I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,<br />so I'm gonna stick around.
3698944 3700987 You still read the newspaper?
3701155 3702948 That's what you got from that?
3703032 3705034 How are we gonna get into this place?
3706869 3708912 Go! Go! Go! Go!
3715377 3716836 Okay. (SHUSHING)
3718380 3721299 Looks like they got a party going on.<br />This could be good.
3733520 3735980 KEVIN: Where is everybody?
3744156 3745949 (PEOPLE SHOUTING)
3751664 3752915 No way!
3761423 3763550 It's some kind of rich guy's fight club.
3763634 3766470 I knew it. They are real.
3770516 3771600 Come on!
3782987 3786407 That's my Boomer! That's my Boomer!
3787199 3789117 Man, this is some<br />Django Unchained bullshit.
3789201 3790202 Water!
3791120 3794498 That's my boy! Good boy! Good boy!
3794665 3796833 Rich people are fucked up!
3797001 3799169 Kramer, get Logan ready!
3799336 3802172 Okay, minimum buy in is now 10 grand.
3802339 3803715 Okay, I think we should split up.
3803882 3805008 Yeah. And let's start upstairs.
3805175 3807010 Anybody finds the egg,<br />just text the others, okay?
3807177 3808970 And for God's sake, be careful with it.<br />All right?
3809054 3810055 Got you. I got it.
3810139 3811265 ANNIE: Be safe.
3813434 3814726 What are you...<br />What are you doing?
3814893 3816144 Who says the egg isn't in here?
3817146 3819940 Also, I have a really good feeling<br />about Logan.
3820107 3823360 Egg, egg, egg.<br />Wow! This is some bedroom.
3823527 3825028 Does it remind you<br />of your celebrity boyfriend's?
3825195 3826362 Are you still on this?
3826488 3829032 Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.<br />That's all I can think about.
3829116 3830200 And that's saying a lot,
3830284 3833412 considering we got Eyes Wide Fight Club<br />going on downstairs.
3833579 3835372 Why is this so important to you?
3835539 3839125 Because, Michelle, look,<br />I am losing my mind here. Okay?
3839293 3840669 We were broken up at the time.
3840836 3844172 I got a hand job from Karen Waller,<br />so you had every right to.
3844340 3845632 So why not just tell me?
3847718 3849761 Okay, fine.
3851513 3853014 It was 10 years ago.
3853182 3856935 I was at a gas station,<br />and I noticed a guy at the next pump.
3858771 3862232 It was Denzel Washington.
3862483 3863734 Hold up.
3865235 3867320 It actually was Denzel?
3867404 3868488 Yeah.
3872701 3874411 He was really nice.
3874495 3878290 He made some joke about how premium gas<br />is probably the same as regular.
3878374 3880959 I took a chance, and I asked him<br />if he wanted to get drinks.
3881043 3882294 He said yes.
3882920 3884421 We both got a little tipsy.
3884505 3886298 I offered to pay for drinks,<br />and he let me,
3886382 3887883 which I thought was pretty cool.
3889385 3891720 We danced for hours.
3894431 3896057 Eventually, we ended up<br />back at his place,
3896141 3899060 and one thing led to another.
3901021 3903940 It was just<br />this crazy thing that happened,
3904024 3905734 and, in a weird way, it made me realize
3905818 3909238 the only person<br />I ever wanna be with is you.
3911073 3912074 Nah.
3912574 3914033 Nah. I don't believe it.
3914326 3915952 -Oh, you...<br />-Mmm-mmm. (CHUCKLES)
3916036 3917912 Well, I took a picture with him<br />at the club.
3918080 3919831 I put it in a hidden folder.
3920916 3922042 Denzel and Michelle.
3927840 3929299 Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.
3929591 3930842 Yeah, it is.
3931009 3932176 Mmm. No, it's not.
3932261 3934638 Dude looks a lot like Denzel,
3935389 3936473 but, uh, it's not him.
3936640 3938850 You're crazy. That's...<br />Look at that, that's Denzel.
3939017 3940935 Okay, let me ask you this.<br />Did he say he was Denzel?
3941103 3942521 Well, no.
3943439 3946066 He tried to introduce himself,<br />and I cut him off
3946150 3948485 because I told him I knew who he was.
3951029 3953114 -What kind of car did he drive?<br />-A BMW.
3953198 3954449 -Hmm.<br />-Three series.
3954533 3957244 Mmm. What was his place like?
3958036 3960413 It... It was a two-bedroom condo.
3962374 3966795 And he used the, um, spare room<br />as an office, so...
3967337 3968921 Do you hear<br />what you're saying right now?
3969089 3970632 Hold on, let me see. (CLEARS THROAT)
3971633 3973843 KEVIN: When you zoom in,<br />the nose gives it away, right?
3975095 3976387 -God damn!<br />-Mmm-hmm.
3976472 3979475 Look, don't beat yourself up about it,<br />okay? There is some good news.
3979641 3982352 (IMITATES DENZEL WASHINGTON)<br />If you wanna get with Denzel, huh,
3982436 3984479 he's standing right here!
3984563 3989063 (LAUGHS) Because the real Denzel<br />ain't got shit on me.
3989485 3990736 (BOTH LAUGHING)
3992070 3996570 I mean, how does this monster have<br />five kids? We don't get to have one.
3997910 4000120 Well, his wife looks like<br />she's about 15.
4000245 4003539 Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.
4003707 4005917 Right, right. No, I know, honey.<br />We're just gonna...
4006084 4009670 We're gonna keep plugging away<br />until something sticks, okay?
4009755 4012507 Gee, you really sound like a guy<br />who wants to have a kid.
4012633 4013675 Well, you know, I'm just...
4013800 4016928 I'm a little distracted right now,<br />honey, as you might imagine.
4017012 4020724 Look, if you're not into this,<br />you kind of gotta tell me.
4021308 4022309 Listen.
4023018 4026146 I wanna have a baby,<br />but how do I explain this? Um...
4027481 4030025 Do you remember how we used to play<br />Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes,
4030108 4031150 and we could play all night?
4031235 4033445 Do you remember, this one time,<br />I made it all the way up to level 86,
4033529 4035822 -and you were not too far behind, right?<br />-Eighty-five, but...
4035906 4037365 And then I kicked your ass at Galaga.
4037449 4039284 -So anyway, what is the point?<br />-Mmm... Anyway,
4039368 4041286 do you remember<br />how we stayed alive so long?
4041370 4043288 All we did was we ate the pellets.
4043372 4046083 We never ate the fruit<br />because the fruit is how they get you.
4047918 4049294 Oh, you're doing a metaphor!
4049378 4050837 Yes, but here's the problem.
4050921 4053381 No matter how long you and I<br />stayed alive in the game,
4053465 4055300 neither one of us ever made it<br />up to the leader board.
4056843 4058761 And you think if we have a baby,
4058845 4060221 we'll be officially settling down,
4060305 4062724 and you'll never make it<br />onto the leader board of life?
4062808 4064392 That's such a good metaphor.
4064476 4066769 Yeah, no, it's not.<br />It's kind of bullshit.
4066853 4067854 Why?
4067938 4069731 -What are we, 16 years old?<br />-No.
4069898 4072567 You wanna go backpacking<br />through Europe? Huh?
4072734 4075570 You wanna, like, have some wine coolers<br />on a football field
4075654 4077322 with Rebecca De Mornay?
4077489 4079157 Not specifically.
4079324 4081868 You know<br />who's always gone for the fruit, Max?
4082035 4086247 Your criminal brother, and that is why<br />the ghosts are about to eat him!
4086415 4088125 Look who's embracing the metaphor.
4088208 4089667 I'm so... I'm... Wow.
4090168 4092837 You know what? All this time,<br />I've just been thinking
4092921 4097050 that if I helped you beat Brooks,<br />you would be less stressed.
4097134 4100595 But you don't wanna beat Brooks.<br />You wanna be Brooks.
4102723 4104516 I'm gonna look somewhere else.

4323944 4326196 Is that the fruit<br />you were thinking about?
4326363 4328239 Mmm-mmm.<br />That's not the fruit. No.
4328406 4329907 Hey, thanks for the assist.
4330075 4331576 Yeah.
4332035 4334412 I don't even know why<br />I really did it. (CHUCKLES)
4335121 4336622 Do you think<br />it's 'cause you're falling for me?
4336790 4338208 (BOTH LAUGH)
4339167 4340168 I...
4341044 4342712 Not... Not sure.
4343046 4345631 Ugh. I was joking.
4345799 4347342 Oh. Okay. Yeah.
4348385 4350345 Aren't you gonna say<br />you were joking, too?
4350512 4351763 Do you want me to?
4351930 4353181 -Oh, my God, you're making this weird.<br />-No, I'm not.
4353348 4354891 -Stop it.<br />-Okay, fine.
4354975 4356935 It's two minutes to 12:00.<br />Where the hell is this bridge?
4357060 4360104 GPS says it's right around here,<br />but I don't see it.
4360188 4361981 Oh, oh. Oh. There it is. 4th Street.
4362065 4363191 -Oh, shit!<br />-(BRAKES SCREECHING)
4363733 4365526 -(MAX GRUNTS)<br />-(ALL GASP)
4369489 4371491 -Oh, my!<br />-That's great.
4372033 4374160 That's great.<br />Now they're gonna kill my brother.
4376204 4377288 ANNIE: Oh, God!
4377831 4379249 Hold on.
4380250 4383419 I'm not an expert,<br />but these gems look plastic to me.
4383503 4385713 "Made in China."<br />Is this thing not even real?
4385797 4387590 Maybe just that sticker<br />was made in China.
4387674 4388716 -Let's let them talk.<br />-MAX: Can I see?
4389050 4391844 KEVIN: Hey, why would the Bulgarian<br />ask Brooks to bring him a fake egg?
4391928 4394931 Uh, I don't think he wanted<br />an egg at all.
4395015 4398018 I think he wanted<br />what was inside the egg.
4398977 4401062 "WITSEC." What is that?
4401187 4402229 Um...
4402314 4403982 We could ask them?
4421333 4423209 VAL: You tell anyone<br />we were coming here?
4423376 4424668 No.
4424836 4426003 I've got your egg.
4426087 4427088 You do?
4427172 4428631 Yeah, but we broke it.
4428798 4430257 -What?<br />-Well, it was a fake.
4430342 4431926 But we have the list of names<br />that was inside.
4432010 4433386 That's what you wanted, right?
4436806 4438891 Okay. Get on the ground.
4438975 4440768 We've got what you want.<br />Can't you just let us go?
4440852 4443104 I said, "On the ground!"
4444022 4445773 You, too, playboy, get over there.<br />Get on the ground.
4445857 4446941 COLIN: Yeah.
4447025 4448151 VAL: None of that<br />child pose bullshit, either.
4449444 4451988 The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,<br />probably you guys, too.
4452155 4453406 Why did you come here?
4453698 4455408 Because you're my brother,<br />and I can't just let you die,
4455492 4456576 even though you might deserve it.
4456660 4458787 Yeah, it's me. We got them all here.
4458954 4461539 You're unbelievable, you know that?
4461706 4463874 You've always<br />been a better person than me.
4464042 4465626 You gotta shut up. Okay?
4465794 4468713 Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.
4468880 4471549 I'm not the carefree dude<br />that wins at everything he touches.
4471633 4474093 You know how I win?<br />I cheat. I cheat at everything.
4474177 4476262 I even cheated when we were kids<br />playing Battleship.
4478014 4479223 What?
4479307 4482810 Didn't you ever wonder why I made you<br />sit with your back to the TV?
4482894 4485688 It was so I could see your ships<br />in the reflection.
4485772 4489275 I mean, I even took five grand<br />every time we played Monopoly
4489359 4490860 before we even started playing the game.
4491027 4494447 I cheated at the Game of Life.<br />And at the game of life.
4494614 4495906 You son of a bitch.
4495991 4498201 -You son of a bitch!<br />-VAL: Sit down.
4499285 4501161 -What about you, Princess?<br />- I don't have anything.
4501329 4504749 But it didn't stop there<br />because, when we grew up, Max,
4504833 4507126 you went off to college, and I...
4508211 4510254 You got a career.
4510422 4513049 You married the greatest girl<br />in the world.
4513216 4515051 I knew I couldn't keep up<br />with that success.
4515218 4517094 Sol...
4517262 4519389 I told everyone that I got a job<br />on Wall Street.
4519556 4520974 And I did.
4521141 4523935 Selling coke to traders.
4525270 4526437 You didn't invest in Panera?
4526604 4527980 I ate at Panera.
4528148 4529732 Jesus Christ.
4529816 4531609 VAL: What's going on?
4531693 4533486 But that's why I've been trying<br />to make it up to you.
4533570 4534862 That's what this whole game night<br />was about.
4534946 4537949 See, I had it rigged<br />so that you'd finally win.
4538992 4541911 The last clue was gonna lead you...
4541995 4543329 Your jacket pocket.
4553089 4554507 ANNIE: Huh.
4556926 4558677 Surprise! (CHUCKLES)
4561890 4564851 I even managed to fuck that up, though.<br />I'm so sorry.
4564934 4566936 I'm so sorry, Max. (SIGHS)
4567687 4568729 (SIRENS WAILING IN DISTANCE)
4568813 4570940 I think we're gonna be okay, though.<br />I got a feeling.
4571024 4572233 You want us to kill them all?
4573318 4574360 What?
4574444 4576028 -Okay.<br />-ANNIE: Walit, wait. Just let us go.
4576112 4577238 We won't tell anyone anything.
4577322 4578948 -We got you the list!<br />-(SIRENS APPROACHING)
4579282 4581701 -What the fuck, man?<br />-COLIN: Fuck! God damn it!
4583703 4584954 -Oh, shit. The fuzz.<br />-Fuck, man!
4585038 4586372 Freeze!
4586581 4587623 MAX: Gary?
4587707 4588749 Don't even think about it, pig.
4588833 4590417 Can't say I care for that nomenclature.
4590668 4591710 (YELLS)
4591795 4592837 (ALL GASPING)
4593671 4594797 MAX: Get down!
4595632 4597383 COLIN: Come on, bitch!
4598968 4599969 Motherfucker!
4601262 4602263 (GROANS)
4603348 4604349 (GROANING)
4604724 4606100 God damn it!
4614234 4615693 Hey, isn't that your neighbor?
4616152 4617361 KEVIN: When did Gary get so cool?
4617445 4618487 RYAN: Oh, my God!
4618571 4619697 Everybody okay?
4619781 4621407 -You're a cool-ass cat, Gary.<br />-You all right?
4621491 4623075 Fine, thank you,
4623868 4627580 though, in sliding, my belt buckle<br />may have inadvertently scratched
4627664 4629248 the finish of my squad car.
4629332 4630916 How did you know we were in trouble?
4631000 4633168 The nocturnal Jenga game,
4634045 4636255 my blood-spattered marital souvenirs,
4636339 4640009 and Max's curious search history<br />piqued my interest.
4640093 4642428 -Right. Oh, God.<br />-You, uh...
4642512 4644222 You saved our lives.
4644305 4645472 Thank you.
4646099 4647350 -Just doing my job.<br />-(GUNSHOT)
4649144 4650311 RYAN: Oh, my God!<br />ALL: Oh!
4650395 4652480 SARAH: Shit!<br />KEVIN: Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
4653690 4654732 ANNIE: Gary!
4656151 4657777 SARAH: Hello? I need an ambulance.<br />Officer down.
4657861 4659320 ANNIE: Oh, shit!<br />MAX: Hang in there, pal.
4659404 4660738 Hang on. Hang on, pal.
4660822 4661948 Hang on. You're gonna be all right.
4662031 4663157 We're gonna get you to a hospital.
4663241 4664867 Okay, look at me. Gary, look.
4664951 4666911 You have got a lot to live for, okay?
4666995 4667996 Do 1?
4668079 4669538 MAX: Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br />ANNIE: Yeah.
4669622 4671498 I have no wife.
4672959 4674627 -No friends.<br />-MAX: That's not true.
4674794 4675920 No, don't say that.
4676087 4677797 -You got us. We're your friends.<br />-You've got us.
4677964 4682426 You don't even like<br />spending time with me.
4682510 4683844 Yes, we do. We just...
4683928 4685596 We've been a little selfish. That's all.
4685680 4687348 -Right, right.<br />-You know, I'm sorry about that.
4687432 4688433 Oh, God. Oh, God.
4688516 4690309 -(WEAKLY) Bastian.<br />-MAX: Huh?
4691686 4694271 Someone please take care of Bastian.
4694355 4697524 Gary, you are gonna take care of Bastian<br />yourself, okay?
4697609 4698735 Listen, soon as you get out<br />of the hospital,
4698818 4700444 you're gonna come to every single<br />game night we have.
4701988 4703322 Don't...
4703698 4704740 MAX: Yeah?
4704824 4707743 Don't you ever
4709579 4711581 exclude me again.
4711664 4714541 -Never exclude you again, pal.<br />-ANNIE: No.
4716336 4718629 -Oh, God. What is that?<br />-What's that?
4718713 4720673 ANNIE: Is that a blood clot?
4721257 4723550 It's a blood capsule.
4723635 4725303 -ANNIE: Huh?<br />-A blood capsule?
4726179 4729932 And that is how<br />you do a game night. (CHUCKLES)
4733561 4734645 What?
4736773 4738399 I've duped you all.
4738483 4739484 MICHELLE: Wha...
4740401 4743695 Hold on a second. Are you telling me<br />that this whole thing was a game?
4744030 4746157 -(BOTH GRUNTING)<br />-(SCREAMS)
4746241 4747492 -What? What?<br />-KEVIN: Damn!
4747575 4748576 SARAH: Shit!
4748660 4750411 I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.
4750495 4752705 When I learned you stopped inviting me<br />to your game nights,
4752789 4755583 I hijacked<br />Brooks's murder mystery party,
4755667 4757502 and I staged a kidnapping of my own.
4757585 4759086 You gotta be kidding me.
4759170 4762339 What better way to prove my worth<br />as a game night participant?
4762423 4764466 Well, what about these dudes?<br />Are they actors?
4764550 4766510 Oh, no. They're... They're felons.
4766594 4767595 Felons?
4767679 4769263 I was able to shave some time off<br />of their parole
4769347 4771557 in exchange<br />for this little side project.
4771808 4772934 We square now?
4773017 4774309 Thank you, gentlemen.
4774394 4775686 That lady hit me with the car.
4775770 4777313 Hey, what the hell kind of psycho<br />are you?
4777397 4779982 You put us through all this,<br />just for your own amusement?
4780066 4783444 No, no. Just the opposite.<br />For your amusement.
4783528 4784695 Did everyone have fun?
4784779 4786447 ALL: No! No.<br />RYAN: Yeah. No.
4786531 4788157 No fun! I got shot!
4788241 4789325 By me!
4789409 4791953 I don't see how that's possible.<br />My men were using blanks.
4792036 4793996 Well, that was my gun.<br />It was a real gun.
4794080 4796749 So, this whole thing, the Faberge egg,
4796833 4798376 the Bulgarian, that was you?
4800044 4801128 You've lost me.
4801212 4803339 The egg, the WITSEC list?
4803423 4805466 It's all you. All part of your game?
4809095 4811597 This is a list of people in<br />the Federal Witness Protection program.
4811681 4812807 How did you get this?
4812890 4815267 From inside the egg.<br />Stop fucking with us. It's over!
4815351 4818062 I'm not fudging with you.<br />I honestly have no idea what... (GROANS)
4820064 4822441 Oh, boy. Yikes!
4823318 4825028 -I mean, how stupid do you think we are?<br />-Hey, Max.
4825111 4827154 Gang, are we looking<br />at the big twist here?
4827238 4828739 He gets shot again!
4828823 4831450 And by who? A couple of new characters<br />you introduce at the last minute.
4831534 4833035 Dude, you've jumped the shark!
4833119 4834703 Do you go to the magic shop
4834787 4836580 -to buy a bunch of these little bullets?<br />-No. (SCREAMS)
4839125 4840459 Hang on.
4840543 4843504 This is Officer Kingsbury.<br />We got a 10-00 on the 4th Street.
4843588 4844589 -(GROANS)<br />-(ALL GASP)
4846507 4848759 Which one of you is Brooks Davis?
4851554 4854181 It's funny.<br />You don't look like an asshole.
4854974 4857017 Do I look like an asshole to you?
4857560 4858644 No.
4858728 4860980 One of us has to be the asshole<br />in this transaction
4861064 4863691 because otherwise I'd have my egg,<br />and you'd have your money.
4863775 4867111 But instead, we've wasted our night<br />tracking you down.
4868863 4870614 Now, we're gonna have to kill you.
4870698 4872324 -What? No, no, no, no.<br />-What?
4872658 4874117 Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?
4874285 4877162 Hi, I'm Max. (STAMMERS)<br />I'm Brooks's brother.
4877246 4879331 And, you know, look. He screwed up.
4879415 4880582 -Right? You got greedy.<br />-Oh, yeah.
4880666 4881708 He admits it.
4881793 4883669 Good news is, though,<br />that we got your egg.
4884170 4886505 It is broken. Uh, my screw up.
4886589 4889091 But, um, I got the list.
4889175 4890968 Which I bet you've been after<br />this whole time.
4891052 4892053 What about this?
4892136 4894054 How about
4894680 4898684 you take this list for free,<br />and we all go our separate ways?
4898768 4900728 Nobody gets hurt.
4900812 4903773 Uh, except the poor folks on this list,<br />I'm guessing.
4904190 4905399 (CHUCKLES)
4905942 4907068 Okay.
4907777 4908778 Okay?
4908861 4911446 Deal. Makes perfect sense.
4911531 4913282 No, no. You give him that list,<br />he's gonna kill me.
4913574 4914866 (LAUGHING) That's nonsense.
4916327 4917328 (GULPS)
4917787 4919622 What the hell is wrong with you?
4920123 4922083 I'm just trying to buy myself some time.
4922166 4925252 Not much. We're just gonna<br />cut it out of you on the jet. Take him.
4928798 4930466 Don't follow us, Max. I'm serious!
4930550 4932677 I'm not worried about that.
4934220 4935471 (MICHELLE YELPING)
4936305 4937806 You just letting them go?
4937890 4939975 Yeah, they've done nothing wrong.
4940059 4942061 Only this one.
4942395 4943854 -Let's go.<br />-Don't follow us!
4943938 4945940 Gary! He's breathing.
4947108 4949318 You know, the only private air terminal<br />around here is at Conway.
4949402 4950945 Yeah. How are we gonna get there?
4951487 4952863 Brooks's house is<br />not that far from here.
4952947 4954073 But our car's not there.
4955283 4956450 Yeah, it is.
4966335 4969046 You know, you don't have to do this<br />because I can just poop it out.
4969881 4973217 We're not gonna go digging<br />through your feces. That's disgusting!
4973301 4975344 Now, hold still<br />while I cut your stomach open.
4975428 4976762 No, no! No! Whoa!
4978055 4979306 What the hell?
4981601 4983394 -Is that--<br />-That's my brother.
4983478 4985021 Get us in the air.
4985104 4986105 Now!
4997241 4998283 -Hold on!<br />-Oh!
5001913 5003205 -You all right?<br />-Yeah, you?
5003289 5004415 -Yup, good.<br />-Okay.
5009086 5010670 Okay, okay. What's our plan?
5010755 5012173 (STAMMERS) I have one idea.
5012256 5014508 It's so crazy, though, baby,<br />it just might work.
5014592 5015718 You're gonna<br />crash the car into the plane,
5015801 5017636 like Liam Neeson in Taken 3?
5018012 5019596 He did that in Taken 3, huh?
5024143 5025894 -All right, are you ready? Here we go!<br />-Uh-huh.
5025978 5027521 (BOTH SCREAMING)
5027647 5029231 ANNIE: Oh, my God!
5032610 5034361 Uh, you missed it. (CHUCKLES)

5374869 5376203 Wait. What's going on?
5376495 5378747 Plus, think about all the dumdums<br />that have kids, right?
5378831 5381416 And think about how much better<br />our kid is gonna be than their kids.
5381500 5383376 It's gonna beat their kids<br />at everything.
5383460 5385003 It's taken you this long to see that?
5385087 5387005 Our baby is gonna crush<br />every other baby.
5387089 5389007 That's right. That's right.<br />And not in that "peak too early,"
5389091 5390300 you know, "kid actor" kind of way,<br />you know?

5452237 5454948 I know you're probably feeling<br />pretty humbled by all of this.
5455032 5458326 But, honestly, I think you're gonna come<br />out the other side a much better man.
5458702 5459869 Oh! Hey, look.
5459954 5461372 I completely agree.

5463207 5464416 -Sure.<br />-I pooped it out,
5464500 5467211 sold it for $3 million<br />on the black market.
5468087 5469922 -Are you serious?<br />-Pretty sweet, huh?
5470631 5472633 Brooks, everybody on that list<br />is gonna get killed.
5472800 5474134 Oh, no, Max, I'm not a monster.
5474301 5476511 I tipped everyone off<br />that they were in danger.
5476679 5478639 For $20,000 apiece.
5479765 5481016 -(LAUGHING)<br />-You're unbelievable.
5481100 5483560 Thank you. It's not like<br />I'm gonna live in this dump forever.
5483644 5486271 As soon as this cuff comes off,<br />I'm gonna buy that house I was renting.
5486355 5487689 I'm moving in with Johanna.

5506875 5509335 This is me at the Regal Cinema crying
5509420 5511922 as I did through much of the film.
5513007 5514466 How were we supposed to know that, Gary?
5514633 5517844 I assume everyone cried<br />during The Green Mile.
5518804 5519805 So, who's next?
5519888 5520889 I'll go.
