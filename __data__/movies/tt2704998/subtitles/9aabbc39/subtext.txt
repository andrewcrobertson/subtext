39960 43350 Whoo!
43440 45635 Who cares about<br />winning? Let's get drunk!
46320 47799 Let's do it.
47880 50348 Let's get you drunk, Merkins.<br />You, too, Borgs.
50440 52271 I'm thirsty. Huh?
53480 55789 I need four shots of vodka,<br />four shots of water.
55880 57776 I want you to send the vodka<br />over to the Merkins.
57800 59518 Send the water to us. You understand?
59600 61296 What former<br />Supreme Court Justice...
61320 62912 - Oliver Wendell Holmes!<br />- Correct.
63000 64353 Yes!
64440 67079 Again, I'd like to ask the players<br />to allow me to...
67160 68798 T o finish the question.
68960 70313 Very funny.
70520 72511 Okay, okay.<br />This is getting embarrassing,
72600 74477 so we need to focus
74640 76073 because this isn't a game.
76280 77759 It literally is.
77920 80195 Bill, do not test me right now.
80280 81960 Looks like<br />we're down to two teams.
82360 84510 So, for double points,
84600 86875 what is the name<br />of the purple Teletubby?
87680 90240 - Tinky Winky!<br />- You're both correct.
91720 93358 He always carried a...
93520 95272 - Red purse.<br />- Yeah.
95440 98079 - And he loved big hugs.<br />- Big hugs.
98240 100151 I know. I'm Max.
100320 101673 Annie.
119720 121736 Ha-ha! You're never gonna be able<br />to hold on to Asia! You hear me?
121760 123910 Hey, if you take Kamchatka,<br />and I take Mongolia,
124120 125480 we could trap Linda in the middle.
125520 126656 - Starve out her armies.<br />- Hey!
126680 127829 You can't form alliances.
128040 129678 Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?
129840 131558 You're high-fiving Hitler?
133880 135711 All right, you got this. Last one.
136400 139039 Oh, that's Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.
139240 140389 Yes!
140560 141560 I'm up. I feel good.
141760 142795 Two words.
142960 144473 Bill. Overweight.
144680 145795 - No.<br />- Single. Out of work.
145880 146880 What the fuck?
146960 148279 Hairy.
148440 149919 Uh, carry, marry.
150080 151149 Marry!
151320 152958 You. Me.
153040 154040 Marry me?
154120 155760 Dude, we got it! We got it!
156240 158310 Annie, will you?
158400 159879 Will you marry me?
159960 161440 - Is that a yes? That's a yes!<br />- Yeah!
161560 163710 I'm really happy for you guys.
177600 179320 - Ooh, lot of pressure here.<br />- Yeah.
179400 180720 You miss, you lose it all.
180800 181835 Stay out of my head.
181920 183856 And you know you have a distinct<br />advantage with the smaller hands, right?
183880 185359 Your goal posts are not as big.
185520 187296 Well, I guess you<br />should've married Uma Thurman.
187320 188560 Yeah, that would've been great.
188600 190800 There's a snap. Here's the hold.
191400 192879 - Ooh!<br />- And a text.
192960 194154 That was interference.
194240 195896 Sorry, honey. I know how much<br />that meant to you.
195920 197478 Come on.
197560 198879 Dr. Chin is ready for you.
198960 200029 Uh, great.
200120 202793 I think we've determined why you've<br />been having trouble conceiving.
202960 205554 - Okay. Let's have it.<br />- Okay, great.
205720 207915 Oh, what's that look? Is it me?<br />Of course, it's me.
208000 210070 I'm not loving your semen.
210160 211229 Oh?
211320 214312 Your count is excellent,<br />but your motility is well below normal.
214480 216357 - That's too bad.<br />- What would cause that?
216520 219353 It can be genetic,<br />environmental factors.
219520 221829 Nine times out of 10, though,<br />it's psychological.
222000 224514 Have you been feeling<br />anxious or stressed?
224720 226836 No, I don't think so. Not really.
227000 228479 Uh... He's always a little stressed.
229400 230656 You don't have to write... I'm not...
230680 231840 Honey, she's writing it down.
231960 235191 Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.
235320 236320 We sure are.
236440 238016 One of the reasons<br />I fell in love with him.
238040 241874 Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more<br />prone to stress than normal people.
242040 243951 "Normal people"?
244040 245376 How long has this been going on, Max?
245400 246594 It's not going on.
247080 249548 Oh, well, you did say,<br />even when you were a kid,
249640 251710 you would freak out<br />if you lost at anything.
252160 254416 - Oh, I was a kid.<br />- Especially if you lost to your brother.
254440 255555 Hmm.
256200 257997 Hey, is that what this is?
258080 259080 No.
259160 262869 You have been so uptight since you<br />found out that Brooks is coming to town.
262960 264536 - I don't think that's true.<br />- Could that be a factor in all this?
264560 265560 Let's be fair.
265640 267949 Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.
268040 270110 Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.
270280 271872 - The what?<br />- The brothers.
272040 274600 I'm not sure why we're discussing this.<br />She's not a therapist.
274760 276751 You're not a therapist, right?<br />With all respect.
276920 278433 - No, but I am a doctor.<br />- Sure.
278520 280476 And I believe in<br />treating the whole patient.
280560 283632 So, what is it about your brother<br />that makes you feel emasculated?
283800 285233 Are we gonna do this?
285400 287216 We're right next to the room<br />where I masturbated.
287240 290630 I think he has it in his head<br />that Brooks is cooler
290720 293792 and more successful<br />and hotter than he is.
293880 295154 I never said hotter.
295320 296799 He's charming.
297000 299275 That's interesting. And is he single?
299440 300440 What's that?
300520 303796 I don't know if I mentioned it, but<br />Keith and I are on a trial separation.
303880 305199 - Oh.<br />- Keith?
305760 306795 Uh, Keith.
306880 309136 So, do you think your brother would<br />wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?
309160 310229 Gosh, I don't know.
310400 311799 Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.
311960 313393 Hurts a little.
313600 315989 Now, is he a tall fellow?<br />'Cause I'm only 5'2".
316160 317513 We're all done with my semen?
317680 319113 He is taller than Max.
319280 321510 - Good.<br />- But he did date this ballerina once,
321600 323397 and she was<br />just a teeny-tiny little thing.
342600 343874 Ooh.
343960 346315 Honey, Gary.<br />Don't mention game night, okay?
346400 347435 Mmm-hmm.
347520 349317 - Good evening, Max.<br />- Hey, Gary.
349480 350674 - Annie.<br />- Hello there.
350840 352432 Hi, Gary!
352920 354433 Just checking the mail.
354520 355555 Oh, yeah?
355640 357216 Some people check it earlier in the day,
357240 361074 but there's always a risk<br />that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.
362080 366437 This spares me the chance<br />of a futile trip to the mailbox.
368080 369229 Uh-huh.
369320 373632 Plus, it allows Bastian here<br />the opportunity to urinate.
374720 376438 You have a good one.
376600 377794 Any plans for this evening?
377960 379234 No.
379880 381279 Perhaps a game night?
381440 382839 We're just gonna stay in,
382960 384234 - just the two of us.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
384320 385912 - Boring.<br />- Mmm.
386080 387399 I see.
388600 393435 I do hope you keep me in mind<br />for any future game nights.
393640 394640 You bet.
394720 398429 I've always enjoyed<br />the camaraderie of good friends
398640 401552 competing in games of chance and skill.
402120 404873 Yeah.<br />Yeah, well, we'll do that,
405040 408669 but tonight, it's just the two of us.
409280 412352 Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.
418240 420549 There was a special on these tonight.
421040 422189 Three for one.
422360 423759 Three for one?
424400 425435 Yup.
425520 427715 How can that be profitable<br />for Frito Lay?
428960 430837 These corporations,
432200 434040 I don't know what they're doing.
434440 437000 Well, you two enjoy each other.
437800 442271 It's often we don't appreciate<br />what we have until it's gone.
446680 448272 - I think that's it.<br />- Okay.
448480 449595 Bye-bye!
455880 458110 If Gary sees the others coming,<br />we're screwed.
458280 459536 No, no, honey,<br />it's not gonna be a problem.
459560 461676 I was very, very clear with everyone<br />to park far away
461840 463717 and just to sneak in quietly, you know.
463880 466394 But now, I mean, you don't think<br />we're being dicks, do you?
466560 468016 I mean,<br />should we just still invite the guy?
468040 469256 He really seemed like he wanted to play.
469280 471111 No, no. Debbie was our friend,
471280 473456 and Gary was just the creepy husband<br />that we had to put up with.
473480 474480 That's true.
474560 476096 He's only gotten worse<br />since the divorce.
476120 478873 Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?<br />Fuck him!
505480 506595 Hi!
506760 508159 Hi.
511560 513152 Can we help you?
513320 514514 I'm okay.
514880 515880 Hey!
516040 517976 Of course. Ryan, why are you<br />coming in through the window?
518000 521276 You said sneak in<br />so RoboCop wouldn't see us.
521440 522800 I meant sneak in through the door.
522920 524114 Well, you were super vague.
524280 525520 - I wasn't vague at all.<br />- Wine?
525640 527216 I know I didn't say,<br />"Break the succulents."
527240 529470 - Hey.<br />- I'm not dressed for this nonsense.
529560 530560 This is ridiculous.
530640 531696 It's like<br />Night of the Living Dead in here.
531720 533320 Yeah, you are asking a lot from us, Max.
533400 534816 I didn't say<br />to come through the window.
534840 536360 This is Max. We used to work together.
536480 537616 - His wife, Annie. Michelle.<br />- Hey!
537640 538640 And that guy, Kevin.
538720 539816 - What's up, buddy?<br />- The door was right there.
539840 540875 Guys, this is Madison.
540960 542313 Yeah, you brought her last week.
542480 544357 You work at Forever 21, right?
544520 546556 - No, no.<br />- I work at Sephora.
546640 548995 - I'm confused.<br />- Different girl.
549160 550479 Same look, same voice.
550640 551709 Nice to meet you.
551920 553440 You, too.
555680 557159 - That's yours.<br />- It's...
557320 559311 No. I think you're<br />supposed to kiss it, right?
559480 560515 Welcome.
560640 562073 Do you guys have a bathroom?
562240 563616 There's one just down the hall.<br />You need it?
563640 566791 Okay, is it on the right or the left?<br />I don't wanna go in the wrong room.
566960 568109 The one with the toilet.
568280 569349 - Can't miss it.<br />- Okay.
572160 573593 - Oh, boy.<br />- Dude!
573760 575796 - Wow. Where'd you find her? TED Talk?<br />- Right?
575960 577234 No, at Chipotle.
577400 578456 Let me ask you something, Ryan.
578480 580176 Aren't you sick of<br />losing game night every week
580200 581376 because of the dates you bring?
581400 583311 They're not always that bad.
586480 587515 Heather, seriously.
587600 589760 How many photos of you<br />with the dog filter do you need?
591480 593630 Uh... "Dennis" isn't a word.
593840 596400 Uh, yeah, it is.<br />It's my daddy's name, so...
596560 599313 These are the elite,<br />the very best, the...
599400 600469 Oh, oh! White people!
600560 602152 - What?<br />- Oh, Jesus.
602240 603434 Okay, unlike you psychos,
603640 605400 I don't give a shit<br />about winning game night.
605600 607079 I don't need that validation.
607240 609521 But you do need the validation<br />of dating Instagram models?
609640 610675 Absolutely.
610840 613149 I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br />I'm not like you, Michelle.
613320 615788 We didn't all meet our soul mate<br />when we were 10 years old.
615880 616880 14.
616960 617960 - Oh, sorry.<br />- 14.
618040 619760 And we didn't get married<br />until we were 19.
619840 621592 - See, that's gross.<br />- You know what, Ryan?
621680 623875 I hope one day you<br />get to meet a lovely, young lady.
624040 626496 So you can love her as much as<br />I love my sweet baby right here.
626520 628317 Yes, find her. Look how cute this...
628480 629776 - Hey, look at this.<br />- So much love.
629800 630856 Let's look at him when we do it.
630880 632376 - Hey, everybody, grab your drinks.<br />- Find the love!
632400 633628 Let's go play, come on.
633800 637076 Dude, do you know what rich people are<br />doing on their game nights these days?
637240 638559 What's that?
638760 640040 - Fight clubs.<br />- What?
640120 641269 I just read about them.
641440 643510 They pay poor people<br />to fight each other,
643640 644816 and then they bet on the winner.
644840 646560 - No, that's not a real thing.<br />- Yes, it is!
646680 648416 If you can have anything<br />you want in this world,
648440 650556 you have to raise the stakes,<br />or life gets boring.
650720 652920 The Kennedys used to have fight clubs<br />at their compound.
653000 655936 Honey, listen, you gotta stop reading<br />BuzzFeed every second of the damn day.
655960 657656 How about some charades?<br />Huh, should we start with charades?
657680 658736 - Let's go!<br />- Yeah!
658760 659909 It's been a while, huh?
660080 661479 Do you wanna wait for Brooks?
661640 662856 I don't think we need to. No, he's late.
662880 665155 - Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?<br />- Yeah.
665320 666536 I thought he was working in Europe.
666560 668915 He was, yeah. He's apparently back<br />for some business.
669120 670120 Haven't seen him yet.
670280 672430 - But we can get started.<br />- Yeah!
672600 674696 - Who wants to start?<br />- Who are you guys talking about?
674720 677359 Max's brother. He's this super<br />successful venture capitalist.
677520 680080 Yeah, he was the first to invest<br />in Panera Bread, you know?
680240 681958 The Fuji Apple Salad was his idea.
682120 683520 - A lot of investors.<br />- Yeah.
683720 685440 He's like the Mark Wahlberg<br />to Max's Donnie.
685480 686515 Well...
686640 687709 Which is a huge compliment
687800 690314 because Donnie was fucking great<br />in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?
690400 691515 He was.
691600 692999 Was he in The Sixth Sense?
693160 695400 He sure is, yeah.<br />You know who is not in The Sixth Sense?
695480 696595 Mark Wahlberg.
696760 699194 Mark would never take a role that small.
700880 702996 Is that right, Madison?
703160 704576 Man, I haven't seen him<br />since the wedding.
704600 706591 - Remember that speech he gave?<br />- Yes.
706760 708336 And then he paid<br />for that whole firework display!
708360 709616 - Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!<br />- Little over the top.
709640 711280 Let's get started.<br />I'm gonna start us off.
711320 712816 - Yes, let's start!<br />- Here we go. Let's do it.
712840 714616 We gotta pick teams first.
714640 715736 - Movie?<br />- It's a movie. Okay.
715760 717536 - Dude, we have no teams.<br />- You just give up?
717560 719073 Better not be Brooks.
733400 735516 You didn't tell him<br />to park up the street?
735680 737079 I did, yeah, like, three times.
737920 739148 Hey!
740160 742390 He got a Stingray, huh?
745760 747193 Turn off your car!
747520 748714 What's that?
751440 752919 Hello, again.
753320 754435 Mmm...
754520 756272 Still wearing the uniform.
757680 759033 Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.
759200 761191 I hope you didn't start<br />game night without me.
763160 764309 Did you not get my text?
764480 765913 What text?
766360 767679 Oh, hello, Officer.
769520 771192 Why's that guy staring at us?
771360 773080 Gary, I want you<br />to meet my brother, Brooks.
773200 776670 We're having a little family<br />three-man game night tonight.
776840 778160 Wait, what do you mean three-man?
778240 779896 You said that Michelle<br />and Ryan and Kevin were...
779920 781399 No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.
781560 782760 I can see them in the doorway.
782840 784717 There's a whole mess of people.<br />Hey, guys!
784880 786313 - There they are.<br />- Hey!
786480 787754 These guys are leaving.
787840 788840 Take off, guys.
788920 791150 We had a little bit<br />of a mix-up with the, um...
792200 793474 - God damn it!<br />- What?
793640 795496 We didn't want him to know<br />that we're having a game night.
795520 798910 He used to come, and we don't<br />like him anymore, so...
799000 800228 Oh.
800640 801959 You know, I think he knows now.
802120 803269 He sure does.
803440 806876 Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.
807360 810113 I haven't seen you in a year!
810280 813238 Hey, you smell good.
813400 816597 What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?<br />Head and Shoulders?
816760 818400 Why do you assume<br />it's a dandruff shampoo?
818560 820936 Well, I mean, you've always<br />been a little bit of a snowstorm.
820960 822416 - Hey, would you hold that for a second?<br />- Yup.
822440 823509 Hey, guys!
823680 826194 Well, you look good, stranger.
826400 827400 It's been forever.
827560 829232 I know, and that's my fault.<br />I'm so sorry.
829560 830788 Sweet ride, Brooks.
830960 832896 Oh, you like that?<br />I just got her a couple weeks ago.
832920 834069 What is that? A Corvette?
834240 837152 It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.
837320 838514 It was my dream car as a kid.
838680 840591 And that's what<br />gave me the idea to get it.
840680 842557 You know what? I love your house.
843600 844715 Are you being sarcastic?
844920 846080 No, I mean I love your house.
846160 847798 It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.
847960 849393 Makes me think of simpler times.
849560 850913 "Simpler"?
851080 852991 Uh, so, how long are you in town for?
853080 854149 You know, I'm not sure.
854320 855719 It depends on how many clients
855800 857920 the firm's gonna be<br />having me schmooze while I'm here.
859000 860040 But hopefully for a while.
860120 862429 I don't get to see you guys, and I...
864200 866760 God, I really miss you, man.<br />I really do.
866840 868432 Oh.
869040 870519 Miss you, too, Brooks.
870880 871949 And go!
872760 874432 Shock-rocker. Dated Rose McGowan.
874520 875953 Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.
876160 877229 Yep. You got it.
877320 879231 - Quick story.<br />- There's no pausing.
879400 882096 You remember the urban myth where<br />Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out
882120 883360 so he could go down on himself?
883520 884555 Yeah.
884640 886056 You don't mind me telling the story,<br />do you, Max?
886080 887200 You're in the middle of a...
887240 889435 You were 14 years old.<br />It's an adorable story.
889600 890600 I forbid it.
890800 892950 I'm a little curious.
893120 894917 Did you blow yourself?
895200 896776 You know the bungee cords on roof racks?
896800 897800 Yeah.
897880 900917 Max took one of those bungee cords,<br />and he put it around his neck.
901080 902080 Here he goes.
902160 903536 And then he wrapped it behind his legs
903560 905835 so he could squish his face<br />down into his crotch,
906000 907513 but the problem was
907680 910274 that it got stuck!<br />He couldn't unhook it.
911160 913230 And about an hour later
913400 915675 Mom comes home, and she finds him there.
915840 916875 Shit!
917040 919000 Her little pretzel boy<br />on his bedroom floor naked.
919560 921280 Little pretzel boy?
921320 923197 Great story. Are we back on now?
923360 924634 So?
924960 925960 "So" what?
926120 927235 Did you suck it?
927600 929016 Let's go. Come on. Brooks.
929040 930440 Back to it. Come on. Play the game.
931200 932997 Poor man's Johnny Depp,<br />starred in Jericho.
933160 934513 Skeet Ulrich.
935040 937429 UN Secretary General '92 to '96.
937640 938680 Oh, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
939120 941918 This guy. He hated kids<br />in Jurassic Park.
942080 943080 Uh, Sam Neill.
943240 944992 Dubstep DJ, looks like Corey Feldman.
945080 946080 - Skrillex.<br />- Yep.
946160 948230 - Rappers love this Cubist painter.<br />- Picasso!
948440 950760 - Big cat shot by asshole dentist.<br />- Cecil the lion!
950880 952233 Time!
952320 953389 - How many?<br />- Seven!
953480 954515 Seven!
957040 958268 You're up, pretzel boy.
958440 959440 Whoo! Go, Max!
959680 961591 - Come on, Max.<br />- All right. Here we go.
961760 963557 And kick it. Go!
965320 966320 Oh, this is easy!
966400 969949 Annie, the famous actor that we met<br />at the airport about eight years ago.
971360 972360 Who?
972520 974600 Only actor we've ever met<br />at an airport who's famous.
975040 976155 Bobby Flay?
976320 979278 Not an actor. This fellow was<br />in front of us at the Sbarro.
979440 981721 We were wondering why he<br />wasn't in the first-class lounge.
981880 983438 Oh, yes, yes.
983960 984960 Who was that?
985120 986155 God damn it!
986240 987776 Max, there's a whole room of people<br />to help you out here.
987800 988869 - Use us.<br />- Good point.
989400 991000 He was the Incredible Hulk.
991160 992195 Eric Bana.
992400 994311 - Other one.<br />- Um, Mark Ruffalo.
994480 995840 - Other one.<br />- Lou Ferrigno.
995960 997951 Holy shit! Primal Fear.
998160 999960 Richard Gere never played<br />the Incredible Hulk.
1000040 1001951 - Time.<br />- Motherfucking Ed Norton!
1002080 1003229 Oh!
1003320 1004355 Primal Fear!
1004520 1005669 Oh, my God!
1005840 1006840 He was the Hulk.
1006960 1008518 - The Hulk.<br />- I forgot that.
1008600 1010397 Max. Zero points.
1010560 1013393 I'd say he blew it,<br />but he won't tell us, will he?
1016040 1017792 Shit! Did you?
1017960 1019996 I can't believe I didn't get Bob Barker.
1020160 1023232 Hey, guys! What do you say<br />we do this at my house next week?
1023640 1024856 - House? What house?<br />- Ooh. Really?
1024880 1027400 Since I don't know how long<br />I'm gonna be here, I rented a place.
1027560 1028959 It's only a couple miles away.
1029120 1030473 You know, it's up on Broadmoor.
1030640 1032073 Oh! Swanky neighborhood.
1032240 1034800 It's a very cool house,<br />but it's just me there alone.
1034960 1036871 It'd be great<br />to have you guys come over.
1037040 1040669 Oh, well, it's kind of a tradition<br />to have game nights here.
1040840 1042034 But you know what?
1042240 1044151 Let's let him show off<br />his big house, huh?
1044320 1045594 That's the spirit!
1045760 1047034 Trust me.
1048440 1051989 This will be a game night to remember.
1052680 1053874 - Oh, boy.<br />- Mmm.
1053960 1054995 Promise?
1055080 1057136 Good night, everybody.<br />I love you much. Drive safely.
1057160 1058275 - Kisses!<br />- All right.
1058440 1059998 - Take it easy.<br />- Bye.
1060160 1062799 That little motherfucker.
1063160 1064275 Whoa!
1064360 1066555 Well, I mean, come on.
1066720 1068711 We don't see him in over a year.
1068880 1071440 He shows up in your dream car,
1071600 1074478 insults our house, and then tells<br />an embarrassing story about you
1074640 1076800 right before your turn<br />just to throw you off your game.
1076920 1079640 Welcome to my whole life. Why are you<br />suddenly so worked up about it?
1079800 1081520 Well, cause now<br />he's messing with your balls
1081680 1083636 and literally killing<br />millions of our babies.
1083800 1085438 Well, that's a little dramatic,
1085600 1087556 but, yeah, you know,<br />I mean, that's Brooks.
1087720 1089880 I thought that this<br />was just regular old brother stuff,
1089960 1091256 - but I totally see it now.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1091280 1093191 He undermines you every chance he gets.
1093280 1094395 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1094480 1096357 - It's crazy!<br />- Thank you, Annie.
1096520 1098636 You know, I've never won<br />a single game against him.
1098840 1099840 I just...
1099920 1102514 I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.
1103800 1104994 - Fix it?<br />- Yeah.
1105160 1106160 What are you suggesting?
1106320 1108390 I'm suggesting we beat his ass.
1108600 1110397 Jesus Christ.
1111800 1113552 Good evening.
1113720 1115631 We're gonna skip the cleanup?
1121040 1122758 Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?
1122920 1124638 No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.
1124800 1126136 - I'm gonna stay alert and ready.<br />- Evening!
1126160 1127320 Jesus, Gary!
1128360 1129509 Where are you headed?
1129680 1132319 We are going to, uh, to my brother's.
1132680 1134796 Another game night?
1135000 1137309 No. No, absolutely not.
1137480 1139072 We're going to, um,
1140000 1141035 have some dinner.
1141200 1142235 Eat.
1142360 1143793 I see.
1144120 1147829 Pity. I was going to invite you<br />over for a dinner I'm hosting.
1148680 1151513 I've purchased four lamb shanks
1151680 1156515 that I've been simmering<br />in a broth of red wine and rosemary.
1156880 1158552 That sounds so yummy, though.
1158640 1159640 Damn it.
1159720 1161915 It was actually Debbie's recipe.
1163400 1169236 I like to think she left behind her<br />recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,
1171160 1174630 but it was most likely<br />an unintentional oversight.
1179960 1182838 Well, here we go.
1184200 1185474 What?
1186560 1187754 I'm sorry?
1188840 1190637 I thought you said something.
1190920 1192717 - No.<br />- Nope, not us.
1193160 1194195 Okay.
1197120 1198758 Have fun.
1202280 1203838 Oh, fuck me.
1204760 1206557 A guy who rents a house this big
1206720 1209837 must be making up for something<br />pretty small, I'd say.
1210000 1212389 No, no. No, I've seen his dick.<br />It's pretty great.
1212560 1214357 Well, I tried.
1215800 1217074 - Hey!<br />- Hey!
1217240 1218496 - Hey!<br />- How are you doing, beautiful?
1218520 1220954 - Good, good. Really fancy.<br />- Very nice house, Tony Stark.
1221120 1223200 Should we give<br />our drink orders to Jarvis?
1223640 1226393 No, I got the Tony Stark part,<br />but then you went full nerd on me.
1226560 1228136 I kind of lost you,<br />but please do come in.
1228160 1229160 All right.
1229240 1230309 - Thanks, Cap.<br />- Hi, guys!
1230400 1231400 What's up?
1231480 1234950 Boy, could sleep four<br />on that couch. Look at that.
1235040 1236758 Oh, hello, friends.
1236920 1240435 Hey, let me introduce you to my date.<br />This is Sarah.
1240600 1242591 Sarah is head of company accounting<br />at our office.
1242760 1244000 Well, corporate communications.
1244080 1246992 And she's also British,<br />which means she's smart as shit.
1247200 1248872 - I'm Irish.<br />- Okay? Same island.
1249040 1250155 Well, it's really not.
1250240 1251376 - Nice to meet you. Hi.<br />- Nice to meet you, too.
1251400 1252515 - I'm Max.<br />- Annie.
1252600 1255592 So, you can't always judge a book<br />by its past covers, can you?
1255760 1257796 - Mmm.<br />- Almost a saying.
1258000 1259120 - Here you go.<br />- Hey, Brooks.
1259240 1260736 - Cheers.<br />- We didn't know if you had any games,
1260760 1262990 so we thought we'd bring you<br />a few of our favorites.
1263160 1264673 Hey, look at that.
1265120 1266712 Whoa!
1266800 1268160 - Huh.<br />- The poor games.
1268200 1270111 I told you we're taking it up a notch.
1270280 1273238 The game that we're<br />gonna play tonight is so epic
1273400 1275755 that we don't need a board,<br />and we do not need pieces.
1275920 1277616 Still didn't need to throw them<br />across the room.
1277640 1278868 I was being theatrical.
1279040 1280792 Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?
1280960 1281995 A what?
1282080 1284096 It's when rich people<br />pay poor people to fight each other...
1284120 1286616 Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.<br />Stop with the fight club, okay?
1286640 1287914 - It's nonsense.<br />- No.
1288080 1289479 Ryan believes everything he reads.
1289640 1291153 Thank you.
1291320 1293595 So, what are we playing?
1296120 1300750 In the next hour, someone in this room<br />is going to be taken.
1300960 1303918 And it's gonna be up to you to find them<br />before they are murdered.
1304080 1306036 Oh! It's a murder mystery party.
1306200 1307952 Not just any murder mystery.
1308120 1309656 I found this company.<br />They do it super real.
1309680 1310749 They use legit actors.
1310840 1313912 You're not gonna know<br />what's real and what's fake.
1314080 1316275 - Fun!<br />- But that's not all
1316440 1320592 because whoever finds the victim<br />wins the grand prize.
1322400 1323992 The keys to the Stingray.
1324160 1325752 - What?<br />- Wow.
1325920 1327558 Just the keys?
1328240 1329673 No, Ryan, the whole car.
1329840 1331956 Oh, yes! Oh, man!
1332160 1333776 You're so lucky I brought you<br />to this game night
1333800 1335870 - and not one of Max and Annie's.<br />- Hey!
1336080 1338640 - No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.<br />- Oh.
1338840 1341115 You're not gonna actually<br />give away your car?
1341280 1342713 Oh, it's just a tax write-off.
1342920 1345229 And the Audi, it's more practical.
1345680 1347113 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
1347280 1349350 Okay. How do we start?
1349520 1351272 We just wait for it to begin.
1351440 1353954 Maybe play a drinking game<br />to pass the time?
1354120 1356076 This group does not play drinking games.
1356240 1358276 Tonight we do, Max.
1359200 1360736 - Oh! "Never Have I Ever."<br />- Good one!
1360760 1362160 Can you believe this guy?
1362200 1364111 Yeah, he's ridiculous.
1364280 1365759 Beautiful house, though.
1365920 1367512 Good champagne.
1371520 1373272 Here we go.
1374680 1376955 Yup. We're at the house.
1377400 1379834 We'll let you know when we have him.
1395480 1397311 Jesus Christ!
1397480 1399198 What's with that knife?
1399400 1400992 It's for the cheese.
1401160 1403720 Okay, all right. Just, you know,
1403880 1406189 really aggressive way to carry a knife.
1407040 1408040 Oh, no, I've got one.
1408200 1411715 Never have I ever<br />connected my work computer
1411880 1415270 to the projector in the conference room<br />when it was open on a WebMD page
1415440 1416509 for chlamydia symptoms.
1416680 1417715 That's not cool!
1417880 1418995 Drink!
1419160 1421037 Just for the record,<br />I did not have chlamydia.
1421200 1424033 It was pubic dermatitis. You get it<br />from not washing your crotch, so...
1424200 1425376 - Okay.<br />- Good for you.
1425400 1427470 I... I like her.
1427880 1429896 And, listen, you're not supposed<br />to single people out in this game.
1429920 1432070 It's supposed to be generic things, like
1432240 1433992 "Never have I ever slept<br />with a celebrity."
1434160 1435991 Oh, I didn't know. Okay.
1436080 1437195 Whoops.
1437280 1438349 - Mmm?<br />- Ooh.
1441560 1442595 What?
1442680 1444477 You slept with a celebrity?
1444640 1447234 No, I was taking a drink<br />separate from the game.
1447320 1448456 - That was bad timing.<br />- Mmm.
1448480 1450080 I see how you would think, but it's not.
1450200 1452961 Well, then why are you breathing<br />like you just got off the elliptical?
1453400 1455072 I'm not. I'm...
1455520 1457795 Come on, babe.<br />Whose turn is it?
1457920 1460229 Uh, it's Max. Max, it's your turn. Huh?
1460400 1462277 I'm not playing a drinking game.<br />Who was it?
1462440 1463480 What's the deal with that?
1463520 1464696 They've been together<br />since middle school.
1464720 1465776 It's somebody else's turn.
1465800 1466800 - Oh. Oh!<br />- Yeah!
1466920 1468936 How could you possibly<br />have had sex with a celebrity
1468960 1470837 when we've only had sex with each other?
1471000 1473256 Please, can you not make this<br />one of your things right now?
1473280 1474440 How is this one of my things?
1475240 1478118 Yeah, Brooks, this is why<br />we don't play drinking games.
1481240 1482992 It looks like the game is afoot.
1483080 1484354 Oh!
1484480 1485959 Thank you, God!
1486120 1488076 Oh, boy. Let's buckle up, huh?
1490280 1491793 Brooks Davis?
1492080 1493115 Yes.
1493200 1494792 - Oh, shit.<br />- Ooh!
1494960 1496393 This is good.
1497080 1498911 Agent Henderson.
1499720 1500755 FBI.
1500920 1503639 Sunglasses at night. It's legit.
1503800 1504869 Sit down, please.
1506120 1507633 I'll get right to the point.
1507800 1512555 The Bureau has been tracking a ring<br />of violent kidnappers
1512720 1514836 in this very neighborhood.
1515560 1518916 And we have reason to believe<br />that one of you
1520200 1521713 may be their next victim.
1523720 1524936 That's terrible news.
1524960 1528236 Contained within these dossiers
1528440 1532035 are the clues you will require<br />to find the kidnappers.
1532200 1534156 You'd like for us to do that, yeah?
1534720 1536640 The Bureau's...<br />What's the Bureau's role in this?
1536720 1538616 Maybe you guys could take my wife<br />in for questioning
1538640 1540376 because, apparently, she got a<br />secret life I don't know nothing about.
1540400 1542675 - Baby, this is...<br />- Shut up, all of you!
1542760 1543909 Wow.
1545480 1547198 It's not a joke.
1547360 1550079 You people are in real danger,<br />and you're running out of time.
1550240 1553994 And I, Agent Henderson,<br />will not stand idly by
1554160 1558278 while innocent civilians<br />are slaughtered on my watch.
1558440 1559696 I told you<br />this is gonna be great.
1559720 1561551 - It's so good!<br />- So good.
1561760 1562896 But, uh, before we get started,
1562920 1565201 I'm required to ask if any of you<br />have any food allergies.
1565640 1566675 Peanuts?
1567680 1568829 Who the hell are you?
1568920 1569989 Oh!
1570080 1571816 Now wait a second.<br />I know you're method and all,
1571840 1574136 but you can't just come in here<br />and break the door.
1574160 1576196 I do not mind this game.
1576400 1577958 Are you crazy?
1592960 1594712 It's very well done.
1596000 1597149 No!
1597840 1599432 That is a strong table.
1600600 1602033 Oh, watch out! He's packing heat!
1602200 1603235 Hell no!
1608760 1610716 Oh! Oh!
1634280 1635315 Come on!
1648560 1651074 You're just making this<br />harder on yourself!
1654160 1655160 Oh, shit!
1656080 1658514 Guys, make sure you<br />get a piece of this cheese. It's just...
1658680 1660989 - Cut me one.<br />- Try it with the quince.
1668720 1670119 Oh, my God!
1670720 1671755 Now he's back.
1671840 1673176 Stop fighting, asshole!
1673200 1674315 Help me! This isn't...
1674400 1676755 The Independent Spirit Award goes to...
1677000 1678720 Let's go!
1678960 1679960 Bye-bye!
1680120 1681678 First one that follows us gets shot!
1681880 1683518 Okay, roger that. You drive safe.
1683720 1685312 Come on, motherfucker!
1685720 1687870 - That was amazing.<br />- Really good.
1688040 1689359 - That was really good.<br />- Wow.
1689640 1693633 Mmm. No, there's something about this<br />that just doesn't feel right.
1694160 1696435 How could you cheat on me<br />with a celebrity?
1696600 1697635 I didn't cheat on you.
1697800 1700314 It was before we got married<br />when we took that break.
1700480 1702710 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1702880 1704016 I've been living in The Matrix.
1704040 1707032 Agent Henderson,<br />you just gonna keep lying there?
1707240 1708320 Is any of this real?
1708400 1709992 Well, don't kick him!
1710600 1712640 - Stop.<br />- He's a regular Daniel Day-Lewis.
1712760 1713856 I thought we both agreed
1713880 1716758 that we wouldn't hook up<br />with anybody else during that break.
1716960 1719360 Yeah, but then you went<br />and got a hand job from Karen Waller.
1719440 1721256 - No, don't do that.<br />- Boop! Boop! Boop!
1721280 1723157 Because it was over the pants,<br />all right?
1723320 1726676 It was, and it hurt. It was very dry,<br />and I didn't climax.
1726840 1728496 Just admit it.<br />You guys did more than that.
1728520 1730431 Don't turn this around on me.<br />Do not do that.
1730640 1731800 Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!
1732120 1733176 Damn it, they got the jump on us.
1733200 1734200 - Come on.<br />- Shit, Kev!
1734280 1735280 Come on now!
1735360 1737176 All right. Here's the first clue.<br />Looks like a riddle.
1737200 1738679 "With shiny fangs..."
1738840 1740478 "My bloodless bite..."
1740640 1743438 "Will bring together<br />what's mostly white."
1743600 1745397 Donald Trump.
1745560 1749348 "Bloodless bite." It's not a vampire.<br />Um...
1749520 1750839 I'll just Google it.
1751000 1752240 It's so inconsistent, isn't it?
1752280 1754080 I mean, they stage<br />this super realistic fight.
1754200 1757033 They give us an FBI dossier<br />but with riddles.
1757200 1759136 It's like, let's pick a tone.<br />Let's stick with it.
1759160 1761056 But that's the game.<br />You wanna win this car or not?
1761080 1762479 Yeah, yeah. More than anything,
1762640 1764240 but I feel like Brooks is setting me up.
1764320 1765680 Do you get that feeling? You know,
1765840 1769310 that this is some game<br />where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?
1771080 1772513 Mmm-hmm.
1773400 1775550 Well, let's not play by his rules.
1776960 1778616 "My bloodless bite, my bloodless,<br />bloodless bite.
1778640 1780596 "Bloodless bite, bloodless bite,<br />bloodless bite."
1780760 1782990 Can you stop chanting "bloodless bite"?<br />It's just...
1783560 1785551 - Trying to think.<br />- Yeah.
1786080 1788594 Oh, shit!
1789120 1791270 Max and Annie must have figured it out.
1791440 1793635 Right. We need to find an advantage.
1794000 1797436 Advantage, advantage, advantage...
1797720 1798720 Brooks' wallet?
1798880 1801030 You think we should steal<br />all of his shit!
1801600 1802600 No.
1807080 1809071 Hi, yeah. I lost my credit card.
1809160 1811096 I was wondering if you could tell me<br />what the last few charges I made were.
1811120 1812189 What are you doing?
1812360 1814096 If we can find out the name<br />of the murder mystery place he used,
1814120 1816336 we can go to their office and<br />pay them off to give us the final clue.
1816360 1817759 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1817920 1822038 You're, like, a double threat.<br />Brains and you're British.
1823040 1824189 Thanks.
1824400 1829793 Okay. What has shiny fangs<br />that bites white things together?
1829960 1830960 A stapler!
1831120 1833111 And the white things are paper.
1833280 1836192 Yes! You are so smart and unfaithful!
1836440 1837475 Oh, there it is.
1837640 1838755 Yes!
1839880 1841598 Look at that.
1841760 1843557 - Flash drive.<br />- Put it in the desktop.
1845880 1846880 Okay.
1847720 1848789 Another riddle.
1848960 1852157 "I'm brown and old by day,<br />white and young by night.
1852320 1853320 "My eyes are glass.
1853480 1855357 "I have nine faces but no head.
1855520 1857238 "I sing to the sky but have no voice.
1857400 1859994 "I'm everywhere and nowhere."
1861720 1863597 What the fuck is that?
1864960 1866279 I mean, how cool are we?
1866480 1867936 - Very, very cool. We are very cool.<br />- Right?
1867960 1871316 You're the cool one. You know,<br />tracking the phone is just a great idea.
1871480 1872754 Still on Route 18, huh?
1872920 1875080 We're catching up to them.<br />Here we come, Brooksie.
1875120 1877793 Can you imagine the look on his face<br />when we find him so fast?
1877960 1881350 You know, baby, I can feel my sperm<br />already coming back to life.
1881520 1882669 - Perfect.<br />- Yeah.
1882840 1885991 So we'll win your brother's car,<br />and then we'll go make a baby in it.
1886160 1888071 - Yeah! We'll make him watch us. Huh?<br />- Yeah.
1889040 1890951 - I don't wanna do that.<br />- No, me neither.
1891120 1892496 - Sorry, don't know why I said that.<br />- I'm not into that.
1892520 1894078 - Not a great idea.<br />- Okay.
1894240 1895468 Okay, great. Thank you.
1895680 1897056 All right, I got the name<br />and the address of the games company.
1897080 1898274 - Let's go.<br />- Yes!
1898440 1901352 All we have to do now,<br />figure out what "bloodless bite" means.
1901920 1903148 No, we don't. That's why...
1904640 1907074 - Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.<br />- Doesn't matter. Let's go.
1907240 1908798 How you gonna be old and young?
1908960 1910712 - That doesn't make sense.<br />- I know.
1910880 1913394 Guys, hey, how's it goin'?
1913560 1916677 I just wanted to wish you<br />the best of luck tonight. Bye.
1919640 1920834 - No.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1921040 1922359 What are... What are you doing?
1922520 1923953 Just being a dick.
1924080 1926310 Oh!
1926400 1928496 - Don't kick him, Ryan!<br />- He's such a good actor!
1928520 1929555 Ryan!
1929640 1932029 God damn it!
1933160 1935600 Baby, hand me those matches.<br />I'm about to burn this door down.
1935760 1938296 You're gonna light a fire in<br />a windowless room that we're trapped in?
1938320 1940936 You slept with Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br />He talked to you about flames?
1940960 1942029 What about that?
1956440 1958237 Where could he be?
1958640 1961108 His phone stopped right here, huh?
1963560 1964788 - Hear that?<br />- Yeah.
1966680 1967749 Ugh.
1968000 1969069 Found it!
1969240 1970760 He must've known we were tracking him.
1970880 1972393 Well, they outsmarted us.
1974400 1975400 Hang on.
1977320 1978958 Isn't that one of the actors?
1979360 1981430 Guess they're not<br />so smart after all, huh?
1981640 1984518 Guess not. We are nailing this!
1985720 1986896 Why are we crouching?
1986920 1989115 I don't know. It feels right.
1992880 1994552 Oh, it's horrible in here.
1994720 1997439 - Yeah, it's sticky. Shoes are shot.<br />- Ugh.
1998080 1999976 Ooh. There he is. There he is.<br />Don't let him see you. Come on.
2000000 2001319 Sit down right here.
2001480 2003755 Bartender, sir,<br />can I ask you a question?
2003840 2004909 Um...
2005160 2006275 You, um...
2006360 2008555 You didn't happen to see a fellow<br />brought in here,
2008720 2009948 looks a little bit like me,
2010120 2012350 but he's got a little bit<br />of a sharper chin
2012520 2013794 and higher cheekbones?
2013960 2015632 So a better-looking guy?
2016000 2017831 No, well, I wouldn't call it that.
2018080 2019559 I didn't see nothing.
2021040 2022758 - Oh, boy. You hear that?<br />- Huh. Yeah.
2022920 2024296 That double negative?<br />"Didn't see nothing"?
2024320 2026096 - It's a little forced, right?<br />- Yeah, I think he's in on it.
2026120 2027536 - 'Course he is.<br />- Look at those tats.
2027560 2029278 So fresh, probably fake.
2029840 2032035 Tell you what.<br />Let's give him a test, okay?
2032200 2034976 Let's order a couple of drinks that only<br />a real bartender would know how to make.
2035000 2036035 Oh, smart! Yes.
2036120 2037553 - Sir! Excuse me. Hi.<br />- Barkeep.
2037720 2039160 Totally forgot to order drinks.
2039280 2040395 Yes, uh...
2041000 2043798 Could I please have a vodka tonic?
2045600 2046635 Well done, honey.
2046800 2049075 I'm gonna have a Harvey Wallbanger.
2049240 2051196 Okay? Appreciate it.
2051800 2053358 Jesus! Did you see that look?
2053520 2054696 Guy doesn't know what's going on.
2054720 2055789 Think you stumped him.
2055960 2057837 Regional theater hack.
2057920 2059319 Huh?
2059800 2062234 - Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?<br />- Yeah.
2062400 2063576 It's nice to get out of the house.
2063600 2066440 You know, we're not gonna be able<br />to do stuff like this if we have kids.
2066480 2067549 - What?<br />- Yeah.
2067640 2068880 - Why not?<br />- Well, I don't know.
2069000 2070616 I was thinking about it.<br />Remember Dan and Linda?
2070640 2072600 Remember how much time<br />we used to spend with them?
2072760 2075558 Just tons of fun.<br />And then they had those twins.
2075720 2077073 Boom! Off the grid, right?
2077280 2079350 Last time we saw them<br />was their Christmas card
2079440 2080480 with the wonky kids on it.
2080600 2083398 Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.<br />They look so happy.
2083480 2084674 But you know what I mean.
2085720 2087600 - We don't see them...<br />- Vodka tonic.
2087840 2089319 Harvey Wallbanger.
2089480 2090600 - Appreciate it.<br />- Thank you.
2090760 2092239 Cheers.
2095120 2096189 Did he get it right?
2096520 2098736 Huh. I do not know. I realized I've<br />never had one of these,
2098760 2100990 but that is a tasty drink.<br />It's kind of tart.
2101160 2102991 You wanna try it? Oh! Honey!
2103160 2104354 Honey! There's Brooks!
2104520 2106988 Brooks is here. Brooks is here.<br />We're about to win this thing!
2107160 2109310 - Yes, yes!<br />- Look who came in here.
2109520 2111829 Oh! No! I think he made us.
2112000 2113736 So what? It's over.<br />What, are they gonna try to stop us?
2113760 2115079 - Let's go.<br />- Yeah, probably.
2115240 2118118 But that's why I brought this.
2118320 2119936 Jesus Christ, honey!<br />Where did you get a gun?
2119960 2122190 No, no, that's the fake gun<br />from Brooks' fight.
2122360 2124715 - Oh, yeah. Boy, that looks real.<br />- Yeah, well, you know...
2124800 2126336 - Brooks never spares any expense.<br />- Look at that.
2126360 2128749 - Yeah, that's true.<br />- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?
2128920 2129955 Why? What are you doing?
2130080 2131080 Lead?
2131160 2133276 Any of you fucking pricks move,
2133440 2137035 and I'll execute every motherfucking<br />last one of you!
2137120 2138235 Very nice, honey.
2138320 2140151 Pulp Fiction, anybody?<br />Right? It's a classic.
2140240 2141468 We love films.
2141560 2143357 Okay, what the fuck is this shit?
2143440 2145616 Well, you're gonna hand over the keys<br />'cause we're gonna take my brother.
2145640 2146675 Bullshit.
2146760 2149911 Oh! You know what's bullshit<br />is your bald, ugly face.
2150000 2152496 Uh-uh. No, that's personal.<br />Come on, honey, let's just keep it fun.
2152520 2154795 All right, I'm sorry I called you bald,<br />you little bitch!
2154880 2156438 Well, that's, again, you know...
2156520 2158750 - Let the gun do the talking. Come on.<br />- Okay. Ah!
2158880 2160598 On your knees. Hands in the air.
2160760 2162376 - Good. Good. Great.<br />- Heads on the ground. Eyes closed.
2162400 2163880 That's it. Get them up, reach for it.
2163960 2165696 - Hands up! That's right.<br />- There we go.
2165720 2167480 - All right, hands in the air!<br />- Get them up!
2167640 2168993 - Yep.<br />- Yo, where's my head go?
2169200 2170428 - Down.<br />- On the floor.
2170600 2171715 Just rest it.
2171800 2173096 How am I supposed<br />to put my hands in the air
2173120 2174456 - with my head on the ground?<br />- Fucking exactly.
2174480 2176118 I did have the same question.
2177480 2180040 Child's pose?<br />Do you guys know child's pose?
2180200 2181320 Fuck is a child's pose, man?
2181400 2182456 You've never done yoga?
2182480 2183520 - Okay, wow.<br />- No?
2184920 2186080 - Cover me.<br />- Show them, baby.
2186160 2187976 - All right. Arms out.<br />- Here she comes.
2188000 2189718 Knees apart if you have back problems.
2189800 2190960 And if you're doing it right,
2191040 2193952 you're really gonna feel that<br />lumbar opening up back there.
2194040 2195136 Let's put your head down.
2195160 2198038 Come on. I don't wanna have to use this.<br />Okay?
2198280 2199713 Okay.
2200320 2201753 Can't you just tell me who it was?
2201840 2204877 I know you, Kev. If I tell you,<br />you'll just obsess about it even more.
2204960 2206473 Okay, fine. How about this?
2206560 2208471 If I guess it right, you tell me.
2208560 2209629 Fine.
2209720 2210720 Was it an actor?
2210880 2212029 Yes. That tower is unstable.
2212200 2214236 I'm not stable! Was he over 40?
2214400 2215400 Yes. Be careful.
2215560 2217676 Okay. American?
2217840 2218955 Yes.
2220880 2222598 It's Tommy Lee Jones.
2223080 2224479 What? Ew. No.
2226160 2228720 Denzel? Was it Denzel?<br />Denzel Washington?
2228880 2231075 It wasn't, unfortunately.
2231240 2232434 Thank God.
2233920 2235194 Um... Be careful.
2235360 2236998 Oh! Sweet freedom.
2237080 2238718 Oh, my God!
2238800 2241160 You see, this dumbass thought<br />he can keep us locked in here.
2241280 2244078 But guess what?<br />You can't lock us in here!
2244280 2246316 You see, hate put us in here!
2246480 2248789 - Okay, baby.<br />- But love is gonna bust us out!
2248960 2250393 - Ahh!<br />- Oh, my God!
2252680 2253715 Oh, my God!
2253880 2255313 Kev! Kev, are you okay?
2255480 2257072 Baby, I fell down.
2265480 2266879 There it is.
2267520 2271035 Yes, I'm so glad I invited you tonight!
2271120 2272269 Yeah, me, too.
2272440 2275671 I usually bring these girls<br />I wanna sleep with, and they just suck!
2275840 2278274 You're like a breath of fresh air.
2278360 2279873 Aw, thanks.
2280040 2282400 I usually go out with men<br />I find interesting and non-stupid,
2282480 2283993 so this is a bit new for me, too.
2284080 2285274 Whoa!
2285520 2286520 Are we cool?
2286720 2288233 Did I say something wrong?
2288400 2289400 No.
2289480 2291994 No, I mean I was wondering why you<br />asked me along tonight,
2292200 2294509 and now I know you<br />just needed a ringer, so...
2294880 2297553 Oh, did you... You thought<br />this was a date? I didn't...
2297760 2300991 No, actually.<br />Well, I was hoping it wasn't.
2301440 2303158 Then why are you wearing lipstick?
2303320 2304514 - I'm not.<br />- Yeah, you are.
2304680 2305874 What are you...
2306040 2307359 You can't touch a girl's mouth.
2307520 2309336 Why? Are you scared I'm<br />gonna smear your lipstick...
2309360 2311032 Oh, my God! You bit me!
2311200 2312296 Yeah, and I'll bite you again.
2312320 2313355 There's lipstick on here.
2313520 2315033 Oh, shut up!
2315200 2317077 I see you wiping off that date lipstick!
2319040 2320189 Ow!
2320280 2322316 That really hurt a little bit.
2323600 2324919 Hello?
2325160 2326718 Hello?
2334320 2335548 Um, excuse me?
2340480 2341993 Yeah, okay.
2342800 2343869 Um...
2343960 2344960 Hello?
2348800 2350791 Oh, oh! Oh, shit!
2353480 2354549 Holy shit!
2355480 2356595 God!
2357040 2358560 Come on! Bloody hell!
2358720 2359869 - What?<br />- Phew!
2360200 2363158 You guys scared me so bad.<br />What are you doing?
2363320 2364548 What the fuck is that?
2365360 2367078 Oh. Well, I just came from
2367160 2369176 a six-hour murder mystery<br />where I played the corpse.
2369200 2371760 I must've dozed off<br />before I had a chance to clean up.
2371840 2373990 Well, you scared the shit out of us.
2374080 2375195 Really? Thank you.
2375280 2377320 Actually that means a lot<br />'cause I do my own makeup.
2377440 2379795 What kind of party<br />has a pregnant corpse?
2379960 2383077 No, I'm actually pregnant.<br />This isn't part of it. This is just...
2383160 2384195 Oh!
2384280 2385349 - Congrats.<br />- Thank you!
2386920 2389309 Um, we want you<br />to give us the final clue
2389400 2392437 to the murder mystery<br />Brooks Davis ordered.
2392520 2394431 Oh, my gosh.<br />But that would ruin the fun.
2394520 2397193 We don't want the fun.<br />We just wanna win.
2397280 2398952 Yeah, I can't do that.
2410480 2412516 This change your mind?
2417400 2418549 No.
2419960 2421313 Don't...
2421720 2423870 What about this?
2432040 2433314 Mmm.
2434400 2435833 You drive a hard bargain. Okay.
2436000 2438309 Let's take it up a notch.
2451600 2455275 I was hoping I wasn't<br />gonna have to dig this deep, but okay.
2455440 2457510 Final offer.
2464280 2467716 You know what? It doesn't matter<br />how slowly you slide it over!
2467920 2470150 Okay? It's $17! How much do you want?
2471000 2473195 - Um, I don't know. Probably $100.<br />- Give her $100.
2473600 2475113 I don't have a hundred.
2476000 2477956 How much have you got?
2478600 2479715 $17.
2479960 2481757 $17?
2482880 2484393 You brought $17 out?
2486920 2488751 Nice!
2489120 2490235 - Thank you!<br />- Cool.
2490720 2492676 So you're just gonna keep it. I got you.
2493400 2494913 Stay back!
2495000 2497016 Hey, buddy, can you just give us<br />the answer to the second riddle,
2497040 2498268 'cause we're way behind.
2498360 2499679 Don't you get it?
2499760 2501432 That was not supposed to happen.
2503520 2505829 Oh, what now? You guys already<br />did the breaking-in thing.
2505920 2508354 Shut up! And get on the floor,<br />all of you!
2508640 2509709 Whoa!
2509800 2511791 Ron, you okay?
2511920 2513831 No, Nathan, I'm not okay.
2513920 2516559 Two guys came in here and attacked me.
2516640 2518278 - Oh, my God.<br />- I know!
2518360 2521397 And I quit Disney Cruises<br />for this bullshit.
2523680 2525256 We can check,<br />but that doesn't make any sense.
2525280 2526508 I'm not wearing a jacket.
2526680 2529069 Maybe it means, like a book jacket.
2529240 2531674 Why would a book have a jacket?
2533560 2534560 Murder We Wrote.
2534680 2536096 Glenda, something terrible has happened.
2536120 2537120 What?
2537240 2538656 Nathan and I<br />showed up for the takeaway,
2538680 2540398 and Ron had been attacked.
2540560 2541880 Where? At the Brooks Davis house?
2541960 2543080 - Yes.<br />- Huh?
2543120 2544120 What?
2545240 2546719 Is everyone okay?
2546880 2548598 No, no. I'm not okay, Glenda!
2548760 2552116 I have a throbbing headache,<br />and they took the host!
2552280 2553952 - Who took him?<br />- Kidnappers!
2554120 2556714 Real ones! Dangerous fucking criminals!
2567200 2570200 I'm packed and I'm holding<br />I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden
2570280 2571429 She lives for me
2571600 2572874 - Sing into the mic.<br />- Jesus!
2572960 2573995 No.
2574080 2577675 Her own motivation<br />She goes round, and she goes down on me
2577840 2578875 And you, Tats?
2579040 2581793 You got something to say? No? Boop.
2581960 2584190 Coming over you<br />Keep on smiling, what we go through
2584640 2587279 One stop to the rhythm that divides you
2587440 2590557 I see you eyeing that, Ponytail.<br />Not on my watch!
2590640 2592517 Bingo! Bingo! I got them, baby.<br />Let's do this.
2592680 2595035 Yes! Okay.
2596480 2597993 Hey, hey, Brooks!
2598160 2600276 - Guess who it is!<br />- Oh!
2600440 2603273 Ready? Hello!
2603560 2604896 - Look at that face!<br />- Oh, shit.
2604920 2605955 That is priceless!
2606040 2607616 You did not expect us this early,<br />did you?
2607640 2609870 I've gotta capture this moment.<br />Honey, get in there.
2610040 2611871 We'll take a quick little selfie here
2612040 2614429 and send it off to the losers.<br />One, two, three.
2614600 2615874 Cheese!
2615960 2617154 Ha!
2617240 2618336 Perfect. Oh, speak of the devil.
2618360 2620476 There's Ryan now,<br />probably calling begging for help.
2620560 2621560 - Ugh!<br />- Ignore.
2621640 2623198 This is not a game, Max!
2623880 2626792 Jesus! Guys, it's a wrap in here, okay?
2627200 2628200 Show's over!
2628280 2630256 Listen, I'm not a venture capitalist.<br />I'm a smuggler!
2630280 2633078 - A smuggler?<br />- Yeah, I made a mistake.
2633160 2634376 I sold the Bulgarian's egg<br />to a different guy.
2634400 2636176 And I have to get it back to him,<br />or he's gonna kill me!
2636200 2639040 "The Bulgarian's egg"? Wasn't that<br />the third Harry Potter book? Come on.
2639160 2641640 Wait, I'm confused. So, this isn't<br />the end of this whole thing?
2641760 2642875 No, it is the end, okay?
2643040 2644758 You said, whoever catches you<br />gets the car.
2644920 2647070 We found you, we get the car. Game over.
2647240 2649356 No! I'm telling you! This is all real!
2649720 2651216 The shitty actors are real?<br />Come on.
2651240 2653080 How about that ridiculous fight?<br />Was that real?
2653200 2654599 Is this gun real?
2654680 2655680 Oh, no, Annie!
2655760 2658035 Oh, no. Oh, no. Bang, bang.
2660200 2661200 Ow!
2669560 2670595 Blood!
2670760 2673354 Oh, my God! I shot you!
2673520 2674999 You fucking shot me!
2675160 2676752 Cut me loose before we all get shot!
2676960 2677960 Come on, untie me!
2678280 2679520 - Get me out of here!<br />- Oh, God!
2680960 2682234 Help me. Help.
2682400 2683549 Oh, my God!
2683760 2685936 - Go out! Go, go, go!<br />- What the fuck did you do to me?
2685960 2687632 Come on, come on, come on.
2688080 2689752 - Hey!<br />- Where are the guns?
2692320 2693355 You shot me.
2693560 2695073 I know. I feel terrible.
2695240 2696576 - Come on, man!<br />- Go! Go, go!
2696600 2697696 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2697720 2698776 Come on, come on, come on!
2698800 2700176 - Oh, my God!<br />- Move your ass!
2700200 2701952 - Honey, get in!<br />- Go, go!
2702120 2703394 Go, go, go!
2704720 2706278 Holy shit!
2707520 2710353 Hold up! Hold up, motherfucker!
2711720 2713836 - God damn it!<br />- Man, come on!
2715880 2717976 Brooks, what the fuck<br />is going on with you? Start talking!
2718000 2720434 I've lied to you<br />and the family about what I do.
2720520 2723478 I buy and I sell illegal shit for people<br />in the black market.
2723560 2724834 Really? So you're a criminal?
2724920 2726240 Oh, my God! They're following us!
2727920 2729256 But I made a mistake,<br />because there's this guy.
2729280 2730336 They call him the Bulgarian.
2730360 2732669 He's got his fingers in all these pies<br />around the world.
2732840 2734831 - What kind of pies?<br />- Illegal pies, Max.
2734920 2737736 You know, the kind of pies that have<br />heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.
2737760 2738816 You know, all that kind of stuff.
2738840 2741593 But he just wanted me to help him<br />find this Fabergé egg.
2741680 2744035 Fuck that! Fabergé egg?
2744120 2745656 - Are you kidding me?<br />- No, I'm serious.
2745680 2746680 And I found it!
2746760 2749399 But then there was this other guy,<br />this Marlon Freeman.
2749480 2751550 He's willing to pay twice as much<br />for the same egg.
2751640 2753176 So what? So you screwed over<br />the Bulgarian guy
2753200 2754536 and those fellows behind us<br />work for him,
2754560 2756376 and they just happen to crash your<br />murder mystery party?
2756400 2758675 I know, right?<br />What are the odds of that?
2760160 2762000 - Oh, too close, too close!<br />- Careful, careful!
2763640 2764868 Watch out! Watch out!
2764960 2765960 Oh, oh!
2768640 2769868 - Shit!<br />- Sorry! You okay?
2770040 2771075 Yeah, I'm all right.
2771160 2773594 - We need to go to the cops now!<br />- Yeah, right now! Let's go!
2773760 2774976 - We can't go to the cops!<br />- Why?
2775000 2776400 The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.
2776440 2777555 On his face?
2779240 2780559 No, in the police department.
2780720 2782039 Look out!
2783440 2784793 Careful!
2789400 2790799 Oh, my God! This is insane!
2805240 2807515 If you call the cops,<br />I'll be dead before I get to jail.
2807680 2809256 Why don't we just get a hold<br />of this Marlon Freeman guy
2809280 2810416 and buy the egg back from him?
2810440 2812680 I couldn't find him if I wanted to.<br />That name's an alias.
2816560 2818152 - Gun, gun, gun! Duck!<br />- Oh, oh...
2828200 2830270 Okay, these guys are not stopping.<br />What do we do?
2830440 2833512 They're not gonna stop<br />until they get me.
2833680 2835591 I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this.
2835680 2836680 Oh, my God!
2836840 2839070 I'm sorry for a lot of things.
2841400 2843920 - Hey! What are you doing?<br />- What is he doing? What is he doing?
2844360 2846351 - I love you, Max!<br />- Brooks, don't be an idiot!
2848920 2849920 Stop the car!
2858680 2861114 - Shit! Go, go, go!<br />- Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
2864600 2866881 Fuck! What are we gonna do?<br />They're gonna kill my brother.
2866920 2868640 Oh, Annie, I feel faint.<br />I'm gonna pass out.
2868680 2870477 Oh, honey, we'll get you<br />to a hospital, okay?
2870640 2871914 No, no, no! No hospitals.
2872080 2873416 This is a gunshot wound,<br />they'll call the cops.
2873440 2874440 Shit, shit! Okay.
2874520 2877034 So we go to a mob doctor, right?
2878120 2879576 Do you know one of those, sweetheart?
2879600 2881318 - No.<br />- No.
2881480 2883400 What about a veterinarian<br />that works for the mob?
2883720 2885438 - You know one of those?<br />- No.
2885600 2887176 Come on. Why are you pitching<br />all the mob stuff?
2887200 2889316 - I think 'cause I'm losing my shit here!<br />- I get it.
2889480 2890560 You're gonna have to do it.
2890600 2891600 - What?<br />- Yup.
2891680 2892936 You're gonna have<br />to take the bullet out.
2892960 2894216 I don't wanna... I don't wanna do it.
2894240 2895456 You think I want you<br />to take the bullet out?
2895480 2897840 I've seen you try to cut a chicken.<br />We have no other option.
2897920 2900309 Oh, my God! This is so bad!
2900480 2902038 I hate game night!
2905640 2907000 Thank you!
2908560 2909560 Hey!
2909640 2911360 Oh, thank God.<br />Listen, Annie. It's all real.
2911400 2912400 Oh, no, I know.
2912480 2914072 Brooks is caught up in something and...
2914280 2915633 Okay, where are you guys?
2915720 2917376 We're all at Brooks'.<br />Waiting to talk to the cops.
2917400 2919630 No! No, no, no! Do not talk to the cops!
2919800 2920880 What? Why? What's going on?
2921040 2922360 - Are you guys okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2922440 2924590 We're fine. We're fine.<br />I shot Max, but he's fine.
2924680 2925680 What?
2925760 2927176 Look. We will meet you<br />back at our house.
2927200 2929040 Whatever you do,<br />do not tell the cops anything.
2929120 2931395 Brooks's life depends on it.
2936080 2937479 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2937680 2938795 Okay.
2938960 2939995 I got a bunch of stuff.
2940080 2941080 Yeah.
2941640 2943835 Pocket knife. Tweezers.
2943920 2945353 Sewing kit. Gauze.
2945480 2947056 Good, good. All right.<br />Wow, you did great!
2947080 2949514 Yeah.<br />And they didn't have rubbing alcohol.
2949680 2952478 And they don't sell hard liquor,<br />so I got you this lovely chard.
2952640 2954756 Good idea. Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.
2954920 2956797 What else did you get, huh?<br />More good stuff?
2957360 2959590 What is helpful in Country Living?
2959760 2963514 Oh, that's for later. There's a corn<br />chowder recipe. It looks really good.
2963680 2965640 - You love corn chowder, huh?<br />- Sweet. I do, yeah.
2965680 2966816 - That'll cheer you up.<br />- Thank you.
2966840 2968319 Okay. And then a squeaky toy.
2968840 2969875 - Huh.<br />- For your mouth.
2970040 2971040 - For the pain.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2971200 2972800 Okay. Well, hopefully I won't need this.
2972880 2974677 - Okay, let's see this bad boy.<br />- All right.
2974880 2975949 Yeah, careful.
2976120 2977758 - Okay.<br />- All right.
2979000 2980000 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
2980160 2981296 - We're gonna push past it.<br />- No problem. No problem.
2981320 2982576 - We're gonna get the bullet out.<br />- Let's just Google.
2982600 2984016 Honey, can you return the text later?
2984040 2985880 This is instructions<br />on how to remove a bullet.
2986720 2988416 - Oh, sorry.<br />- It's an alt-right militia website,
2988440 2990080 so I'm just gonna<br />ignore the racist stuff.
2990200 2991269 - Good. Good, good.<br />- Yeah?
2991480 2992913 Okay. "Step one, sterile gloves."
2993360 2994588 Check!
2994760 2995936 We're doing the best we can, right?
2995960 2997678 Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.
2997840 2999353 "Step two."
2999440 3002034 Um... Okay. "Disinfect wound."
3002240 3004196 Right, yeah.<br />That's gonna sting, isn't it?
3004280 3005679 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
3005760 3007079 - Let's do it.<br />- Okay?
3008960 3011155 That smarts, huh?
3011320 3013072 Yeah.
3013240 3015196 Gonna administer anesthetic.
3015360 3017496 - We don't have that.<br />- Just gonna skip that one. Okay.
3017520 3019240 "Step four,<br />apply pressure above the wound."
3019280 3021191 Here, you squeeze that there.
3021280 3022376 - I got it.<br />- Great. Thank you.
3022400 3024960 We're just gonna<br />make two tiny incisions...
3025040 3026616 - Oh, my God.<br />- On either side of the wound.
3026640 3028835 Easy-peasy. Huh?
3029120 3030314 This is fun, huh?
3030440 3032271 - Are you having fun?<br />- No.
3032400 3033469 Let's get the bullet.
3033560 3034976 - Okay. Here we go.<br />- Let's get in there and get it.
3035000 3037176 - Nice and small, nice and small, baby.<br />- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
3037200 3038269 Tiny, teeny.
3042040 3044349 That's not small. That's really big!
3044520 3045555 So big?
3045640 3047756 Way too big, baby.<br />It's a bullet, not a grapefruit.
3047840 3050056 I'm sorry! I'm sorry.<br />This is my first time. I don't know...
3050080 3051559 Oh, there's so much blood.
3052920 3056071 - No, no. Don't you start doing that.<br />- No, you're gonna make...
3059560 3060595 - I'm sorry.<br />- Stop it.
3060720 3062136 I'm looking at you,<br />and you're making me...
3062160 3063616 Well, don't look at me.<br />I won't look at it.
3063640 3065416 - Push through. Let's go.<br />- Okay. All right, okay.
3065440 3066536 - No more cutting.<br />- Oh, shit.
3066560 3067696 Just get the tweezers<br />and get the bullet out, baby.
3067720 3068948 Shit, shit, shit. Um...
3069040 3071156 - What? What happened?<br />- Phone went to sleep.
3071240 3072536 You gotta set it so that thing stays on.
3072560 3073776 - No. My phone doesn't do that.<br />- Sure it does.
3073800 3075176 Same phone as mine. Just change it.
3075200 3077536 Just gonna touch it with my nose<br />every 30 seconds. It's fine.
3077560 3079016 Don't be afraid of your phone.<br />Get in there, go to the settings,
3079040 3081776 go to "Display" and change the timing<br />so that it doesn't revert to sleep mode.
3081800 3082835 - Revert?<br />- Yeah.
3082920 3084576 What are you, Steve Jobs?<br />I'm not reverting anything. No.
3084600 3085696 No, I'm just<br />unafraid of my phone, honey.
3085720 3086720 It's so fucking simple.
3087200 3088918 Shh! Quiet. I know what I'm doing, okay?
3089120 3090314 Do you?
3090400 3091400 Yes.
3091600 3093352 - Here we go. Here we go.<br />- Here she goes.
3093520 3094999 You're like a dolphin.
3095160 3096878 All right. This part's gonna hurt.
3097040 3098189 I don't... I don't doubt it.
3098360 3099759 Okay, let's do this.
3100200 3101200 Okay.
3102360 3103554 Ooh... Oh, wait.
3104120 3105440 What is that?
3105480 3106480 You hear that?
3106600 3108113 What's that sound? What's that sound?
3108200 3109428 Is that the bullet?
3109600 3111875 - That's bone!<br />- What?
3111960 3113518 That's not right.
3113960 3117794 Okay. Um, what do the racists say<br />if you can't find the bullet?
3117880 3119296 Yeah, that's bone. You got the bone.
3119320 3121311 I'm looking at my bone. Look right here.
3121480 3124552 Max, did you get shot twice?
3127760 3128875 That's the exit wound.
3129400 3130913 Oh, it came out!
3131040 3132519 Yup. Nothing to remove.
3132680 3133880 The bullet has exited the arm.
3134000 3135256 Well, let's just sew<br />that sucker up, huh?
3135280 3136280 Yeah.
3138560 3141199 No, no. Honey, don't, don't look at...
3141280 3142315 Stop it.
3144720 3145789 I'm sorry.
3146120 3148736 Now, the Bulgarian's guys have Brooks,<br />and the only way to save him
3148760 3150990 is to get that egg<br />from this Marlon Freeman guy.
3151080 3153674 I can't believe your brother's been<br />lying to us this whole time.
3153760 3155478 He's even cooler than we thought.
3155560 3157949 Honey, I think you sewed my arm<br />to my sleeve.
3158040 3160216 I didn't even know<br />Morgan Freeman collected Fabergé eggs.
3160240 3162037 Aren't those worth millions of dollars?
3162120 3164076 It's Marlon Freeman,<br />but that's just an alias.
3164160 3166296 Somehow, we gotta find out<br />his real name, find out his address.
3166320 3168470 - Police computer.<br />- What do you mean?
3168560 3170630 I once dated this girl<br />whose father was a cop.
3170720 3172676 She showed me her dad's police computer.
3172760 3175558 It has a database with<br />every known alias on it.
3175640 3178279 I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'<br />real name on it.
3178360 3180976 So, if we called her up, would she<br />let you go on her dad's computer?
3181000 3183309 No. No. No way! That ended badly.
3183600 3186440 So how are we gonna get into a police<br />computer without the cops knowing?
3186480 3187856 - Billy Bob Thornton!<br />- What?
3187880 3189916 - What?<br />- You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?
3190000 3194357 Hang on. Hang on. I know<br />where we can get on a police computer.
3195480 3197710 - Hey!<br />- Gary!
3198080 3199399 Goodness.
3200080 3202036 To what do<br />Bastian and I owe the pleasure?
3202200 3203599 Well, we were all just talking,
3203760 3206513 and we realized<br />we haven't had a game night in ages,
3206680 3208238 just the seven of us.
3208320 3209320 So...
3209400 3211356 I thought you were going<br />to your brother's house.
3211440 3212589 I never said that.
3212680 3214796 Come on, Gare Bear.<br />Live a little! It's the weekend!
3214880 3217997 We were just saying how you were always<br />better at games than Debbie was.
3218080 3220275 I'll thank you<br />not to besmirch my ex-wife.
3220720 3222199 That woman is an angel.
3222280 3226512 Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games<br />than you.
3227080 3233076 I will admit I have eagerly awaited<br />a visit such as this.
3239160 3240434 Where'd he go?
3241080 3242593 Do we follow him?
3242680 3243874 It seems like it.
3243960 3245598 - Ryan, you go first.<br />- I'm scared.
3252360 3254828 Help yourself to popped corn<br />with sea salt.
3254920 3256751 Oh! Oh!
3257640 3259119 Yummy, yummy.
3259640 3262234 I can't believe that you read my mind.<br />I was craving popcorn.
3262400 3264709 You have a framed photo of game night?
3264920 3268708 Doesn't everyone have photographs<br />of their best friends in their homes?
3270200 3272555 Of course. We do.
3273160 3274912 Max, uh, you wanna go first?
3275000 3276877 Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.
3277520 3278714 Oh. There's a loose one.
3278800 3281189 Always in the middle.<br />That's where you wanna go.
3281280 3282679 Can I use your john real quick?
3282760 3285149 Of course.<br />It's the end of the hall, next to our...
3288720 3290438 My bedroom.
3291920 3292955 Okay.
3315480 3317152 Oh, no, Gary.
3344800 3348315 So, Sarah, how long have you two<br />been a couple?
3349160 3351628 Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...
3351760 3354877 We work together. I wouldn't, um...<br />I wouldn't do that thing.
3354960 3360432 I see. I thought I detected a certain<br />chemistry between the two of you.
3360560 3363120 No. No way.
3363760 3365910 - No, that's not...<br />- Mmm. Mmm.
3366240 3369869 Then again, I'm not the best judge<br />of chemistry in the world.
3377840 3378989 Hmm.
3379600 3381272 Oh, because your wife left you.
3381840 3383068 Oh, shit.
3392800 3394950 Hello, Donald Anderton.
3404000 3405956 Oh!
3406640 3411156 So many possible moves.<br />I just don't know where to begin.
3413160 3414718 Um, maybe... Ooh...
3416040 3417656 - Decision-making.<br />- Come on, Annie. Just make up your mind.
3417680 3419238 - No!<br />- Please! No?
3421480 3424392 Yup, take your time.
3456480 3459278 Oh, Brooks. What have you<br />gotten yourself into?
3476560 3480633 Oh, shit. Where did you<br />come from, little guy?
3482000 3485879 Son of a bitch.<br />Hey! What are you, a vampire?
3486120 3488759 Oh, God. Oh, God.
3491640 3494996 Oh, my God. Has that got it?
3495160 3499039 No, that doesn't got it.<br />God damn it. Come on!
3503560 3504560 No!
3506440 3507440 I should go check on him.
3507520 3508920 I think he's fine.
3509160 3512152 - He cried out.<br />- Tell me about Debbie.
3515000 3516228 I beg your pardon.
3516960 3521431 Oh, just I... I never met her.<br />I'd love to hear all about her.
3532400 3533833 Where do I begin?
3534000 3536594 All right, you wanna take a bath?<br />We'll take a little bath.
3536760 3541550 There we go. Okay.<br />All right. Here we go.
3543800 3546633 There we go, huh? Huh?
3548120 3549314 Oh, it's so much worse.
3550000 3553436 Oh, God. And what did I do to this?<br />What the fuck is this thing?
3554960 3556075 Oh, Debbie.
3556160 3557354 Oh!
3564920 3567354 Okay. Fuck this.
3567960 3569791 Hey, guys, Gary was right.<br />It's awful late.
3569880 3572189 Let's get home, get to bed, huh?<br />Get out of his hair.
3572280 3574475 We haven't finished the game.<br />It's your turn, Max.
3574640 3575868 Oh, my turn, huh?
3576040 3578554 Okay, be careful now, Max.<br />Oh!
3578640 3580358 Well, game over. I went in a little hot.
3580520 3583432 - Why did you...<br />- Thanks! Good to see you, Gary.
3583600 3585716 When shall we play next?
3585800 3588792 Soon. We'll call you.
3593640 3596518 Bastian. Baby!
3598280 3602319 So, how are we supposed to get this egg<br />out of Donald Anderton's house?
3602400 3604038 I don't know. I'm gonna figure it out.
3605120 3607759 "Unknown Caller." Please don't be Gary.
3607840 3610434 - Hello?<br />- We have your brother.
3611320 3612469 Um...
3612560 3614073 Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,
3614160 3615376 and we're actually<br />on our way there right now.
3615400 3617136 We can do a swap, okay?<br />Please don't hurt Brooks.
3617160 3621073 Meet us on the East 4th Street bridge<br />at midnight. If you're late, he dies.
3621160 3622593 - Oh, my God.<br />- Um...
3623160 3625720 Boy, that's less than an hour from now.
3627160 3628229 Hello?
3628320 3631471 What's up with this guy's voice?<br />He sounds like a monster.
3631640 3633392 He's using a voice changer, Ryan.
3633480 3635789 He still sounds like a scary monster.
3639120 3642874 And we are here.
3643480 3644536 All right. You guys head home,
3644560 3645896 and I will call as soon<br />as I get the egg, all right?
3645920 3648070 What? Wait a second. Wait.<br />I'm going with you.
3648240 3650296 No, Annie. It could be very, very<br />dangerous in there, okay?
3650320 3652601 Listen, Brooks shouldn't have<br />dragged any of us into this,
3652640 3654376 but he is my brother,<br />and it's up to me to fix it.
3654400 3656470 No, bullshit!<br />We're all in this together!
3656560 3658676 No, no, no. Max is right.<br />You guys should go home,
3658840 3661035 but you and I are doing this.
3661200 3663555 Okay, what happens<br />if you guys don't make it out?
3663640 3665976 We don't come to game night because<br />we're dying to play charades and shit.
3666000 3667320 We come because we love you guys.
3667360 3669476 Honestly, this is<br />the best part of our week.
3669560 3672711 Mine, too. And I have<br />a lot of options on the weekend.
3672800 3674870 Wow. You guys...
3675000 3676991 Thank you. That's very nice.
3677720 3679517 Aw, good friends.
3680200 3683431 You should probably go, though, right?<br />I mean, you don't even know us.
3683840 3685398 Yeah, why are you still here?
3685480 3688836 Oh, I don't know.<br />I just got caught up in it.
3688920 3690911 Also, if I go home now,
3691000 3692816 and then I read in the newspaper<br />tomorrow that you all died,
3692840 3696799 I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,<br />so I'm gonna stick around.
3697560 3699596 You still read the newspaper?
3699760 3701557 That's what you got from that?
3701640 3703631 How are we gonna get into this place?
3705480 3707516 Go! Go! Go! Go!
3713960 3715439 Okay.
3717000 3719912 Looks like they got a party going on.<br />This could be good.
3732120 3734588 Where is everybody?
3750280 3751508 No way!
3760040 3762156 It's some kind of rich guy's fight club.
3762240 3765073 I knew it. They are real.
3769120 3770189 Come on!
3781600 3784990 That's my Boomer! That's my Boomer!
3785800 3787711 Man, this is some<br />Django Unchained bullshit.
3787800 3788800 Water!
3789720 3793076 That's my boy! Good boy! Good boy!
3793280 3795430 Rich people are fucked up!
3795600 3797750 Kramer, get Logan ready!
3797920 3800753 Okay, minimum buy in is now 10 grand.
3800960 3802313 Okay, I think we should split up.
3802480 3803720 Yeah. And let's start upstairs.
3803760 3805720 Anybody finds the egg,<br />just text the others, okay?
3805760 3807616 And for God's sake, be careful with it.<br />All right?
3807640 3808640 Got you. I got it.
3808760 3809875 Be safe.
3812040 3813400 What are you...<br />What are you doing?
3813480 3814754 Who says the egg isn't in here?
3815760 3818558 Also, I have a really good feeling<br />about Logan.
3818720 3821951 Egg, egg, egg.<br />Wow! This is some bedroom.
3822120 3823776 Does it remind you<br />of your celebrity boyfriend's?
3823800 3824949 Are you still on this?
3825080 3827640 Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.<br />That's all I can think about.
3827720 3828789 And that's saying a lot,
3828880 3831997 considering we got Eyes Wide Fight Club<br />going on downstairs.
3832200 3833952 Why is this so important to you?
3834160 3837709 Because, Michelle, look,<br />I am losing my mind here. Okay?
3837880 3839279 We were broken up at the time.
3839440 3842750 I got a hand job from Karen Waller,<br />so you had every right to.
3842960 3844234 So why not just tell me?
3846320 3848356 Okay, fine.
3850120 3851599 It was 10 years ago.
3851800 3855509 I was at a gas station,<br />and I noticed a guy at the next pump.
3857360 3860830 It was Denzel Washington.
3861080 3862308 Hold up.
3863840 3865910 It actually was Denzel?
3866000 3867069 Yeah.
3871320 3872992 He was really nice.
3873080 3876868 He made some joke about how premium gas<br />is probably the same as regular.
3876960 3879554 I took a chance, and I asked him<br />if he wanted to get drinks.
3879640 3880868 He said yes.
3881520 3883033 We both got a little tipsy.
3883120 3884872 I offered to pay for drinks,<br />and he let me,
3885000 3886479 which I thought was pretty cool.
3888000 3890309 We danced for hours.
3893040 3894680 Eventually, we ended up<br />back at his place,
3894760 3897672 and one thing led to another.
3899640 3902552 It was just<br />this crazy thing that happened,
3902640 3904312 and, in a weird way, it made me realize
3904400 3907836 the only person<br />I ever wanna be with is you.
3909680 3910680 Nah.
3911160 3912639 Nah. I don't believe it.
3912920 3914558 - Oh, you...<br />- Mmm-mmm.
3914640 3916517 Well, I took a picture with him<br />at the club.
3916680 3918432 I put it in a hidden folder.
3919520 3920635 Denzel and Michelle.
3926440 3927919 Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.
3928200 3929428 Yeah, it is.
3929600 3930749 Mmm. No, it's not.
3930880 3933235 Dude looks a lot like Denzel,
3934000 3935069 but, uh, it's not him.
3935240 3937435 You're crazy. That's...<br />Look at that, that's Denzel.
3937600 3939640 Okay, let me ask you this.<br />Did he say he was Denzel?
3939720 3941119 Well, no.
3942040 3944679 He tried to introduce himself,<br />and I cut him off
3944760 3947069 because I told him I knew who he was.
3949640 3951710 - What kind of car did he drive?<br />- A BMW.
3951800 3953028 - Hmm.<br />- Three series.
3953120 3955839 Mmm. What was his place like?
3956640 3958995 It... It was a two-bedroom condo.
3960960 3965397 And he used the, um, spare room<br />as an office, so...
3965920 3967520 Do you hear<br />what you're saying right now?
3967680 3969238 Hold on, let me see.
3970240 3972435 When you zoom in,<br />the nose gives it away, right?
3973680 3974999 - God damn!<br />- Mmm-hmm.
3975080 3978072 Look, don't beat yourself up about it,<br />okay? There is some good news.
3978240 3980959 If you wanna get with Denzel, huh,
3981040 3983076 he's standing right here!
3983160 3987950 Because the real Denzel<br />ain't got shit on me.
3990680 3995800 I mean, how does this monster have<br />five kids? We don't get to have one.
3996520 3998715 Well, his wife looks like<br />she's about 15.
3998840 4002150 Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.
4002320 4004515 Right, right. No, I know, honey.<br />We're just gonna...
4004680 4008275 We're gonna keep plugging away<br />until something sticks, okay?
4008360 4011113 Gee, you really sound like a guy<br />who wants to have a kid.
4011240 4012320 Well, you know, I'm just...
4012400 4015517 I'm a little distracted right now,<br />honey, as you might imagine.
4015600 4019309 Look, if you're not into this,<br />you kind of gotta tell me.
4019920 4020920 Listen.
4021600 4024751 I wanna have a baby,<br />but how do I explain this? Um...
4026080 4028640 Do you remember how we used to play<br />Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes,
4028720 4029816 and we could play all night?
4029840 4032096 Do you remember, this one time,<br />I made it all the way up to level 86,
4032120 4034496 - and you were not too far behind, right?<br />- Eighty-five, but...
4034520 4036000 And then I kicked your ass at Galaga.
4036040 4037920 - So anyway, what is the point?<br />- Mmm... Anyway,
4037960 4039871 do you remember<br />how we stayed alive so long?
4039960 4041871 All we did was we ate the pellets.
4041960 4044679 We never ate the fruit<br />because the fruit is how they get you.
4046520 4047873 Oh, you're doing a metaphor!
4047960 4049439 Yes, but here's the problem.
4049520 4051988 No matter how long you and I<br />stayed alive in the game,
4052080 4054200 neither one of us ever made it<br />up to the leader board.
4055440 4057351 And you think if we have a baby,
4057440 4058839 we'll be officially settling down,
4058920 4061309 and you'll never make it<br />onto the leader board of life?
4061400 4062992 That's such a good metaphor.
4063080 4065355 Yeah, no, it's not.<br />It's kind of bullshit.
4065440 4066440 Why?
4066520 4068317 - What are we, 16 years old?<br />- No.
4068480 4071153 You wanna go backpacking<br />through Europe? Huh?
4071320 4074153 You wanna, like, have some wine coolers<br />on a football field
4074240 4075912 with Rebecca De Mornay?
4076080 4077752 Not specifically.
4077920 4080480 You know<br />who's always gone for the fruit, Max?
4080640 4084838 Your criminal brother, and that is why<br />the ghosts are about to eat him!
4085000 4086718 Look who's embracing the metaphor.
4086800 4088279 I'm so... I'm... Wow.
4088760 4091433 You know what? All this time,<br />I've just been thinking
4091520 4095638 that if I helped you beat Brooks,<br />you would be less stressed.
4095720 4099190 But you don't wanna beat Brooks.<br />You wanna be Brooks.
4101320 4103117 I'm gonna look somewhere else.
4115840 4118195 Come on, Logan! Boomer ain't shit!
4118280 4119759 Hey, ADHD!
4119840 4121400 We're supposed to be looking for the...
4123960 4126599 Holy shit. I'm right again.
4128720 4130312 Wait, where are you going?
4130400 4132376 Everybody's watching the fight.<br />I'm gonna go grab it.
4132400 4135233 - No, don't fucking...<br />- Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.
4147280 4148280 Kill him!
4150280 4152191 Oh, shit!
4155840 4156840 Who the hell are you?
4157880 4158880 Me?
4158960 4161952 Yeah. Who are you?<br />And what are you doing with my egg?
4162640 4164870 Oh. I was just admiring it.
4164960 4168999 I got a bunch of these fancy-pants eggs<br />back at home. In my mansion.
4169520 4171715 - Uh-huh.<br />- This one's ugly. Hmm.
4173240 4174639 Does anybody know this guy?
4174720 4180397 I certainly hope so.<br />I'm the CEO of Cyberdyne Systems.
4180480 4182038 I should go.
4182920 4184114 Boomer, take him down.
4184200 4186156 Everyone hold on a goddamn second!
4190720 4191869 Boomer!
4196760 4197760 Hey, any luck yet?
4197920 4199035 - No.<br />- You?
4199200 4203159 Go! Go! Go! I got it! I got it!<br />Let's go! Come on!
4213280 4214536 Sorry. Sorry.
4214560 4215754 Hey, Ryan! Ryan!
4216200 4217474 Oh, shit.
4217840 4219159 No!
4219240 4220673 Okay, okay.
4220760 4222113 Shit!
4225320 4228630 Michelle, I'm open! Hit me.<br />Hit me. Baby.
4230920 4232319 - Oh-ho-ho!<br />- Security!
4232480 4233799 No, you don't.
4234440 4235953 Holy shit!
4236040 4237268 Kev, up here! Throw it!
4237360 4238360 I got it!
4239040 4241315 Oh! Oh, my God, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes!
4242000 4245754 Oh, no! No! No! Get away! Get away!
4249760 4251352 Okay. Oh!
4251680 4253159 Go to the other side!
4253240 4254593 Oh, my God!
4254680 4256636 Annie! Annie, where are you?
4256720 4259439 - Max! Max!<br />- Over here! Hey!
4266440 4267634 No, no, no!
4269960 4271188 Get off me!
4275120 4276120 No!
4278200 4280191 That was easy.
4282640 4284358 Oh.
4288960 4292032 Man, glass tables<br />are acting weird tonight.
4292880 4294518 Go, go, go!
4294960 4296712 Get in! Get in the van!
4296800 4298392 Get in, get in, get in!
4298480 4300516 Get them! Get them!
4316040 4319430 So, you don't wanna have a baby,<br />so we can do more shit like that?
4320240 4322231 No. No.
4322560 4324790 Is that the fruit<br />you were thinking about?
4324960 4326837 Mmm-mmm.<br />That's not the fruit. No.
4327000 4328513 Hey, thanks for the assist.
4328680 4330159 Yeah.
4330640 4332995 I don't even know why<br />I really did it.
4333720 4335560 Do you think<br />it's 'cause you're falling for me?
4337760 4338760 I...
4339640 4341312 Not... Not sure.
4341640 4344234 Ugh. I was joking.
4344400 4345958 Oh. Okay. Yeah.
4347000 4348956 Aren't you gonna say<br />you were joking, too?
4349120 4350348 Do you want me to?
4350520 4351936 - Oh, my God, you're making this weird.<br />- No, I'm not.
4351960 4353473 - Stop it.<br />- Okay, fine.
4353560 4355656 It's two minutes to 12:00.<br />Where the hell is this bridge?
4355680 4358717 GPS says it's right around here,<br />but I don't see it.
4358800 4360597 Oh, oh. Oh. There it is. 4th Street.
4360680 4361960 Oh, shit!
4368080 4370071 - Oh, my!<br />- That's great.
4370640 4372756 That's great.<br />Now they're gonna kill my brother.
4374800 4375869 Oh, God!
4376440 4377839 Hold on.
4378840 4382037 I'm not an expert,<br />but these gems look plastic to me.
4382120 4384315 "Made in China."<br />Is this thing not even real?
4384400 4386197 Maybe just that sticker<br />was made in China.
4386280 4387616 - Let's let them talk.<br />- Can I see?
4387640 4390440 Hey, why would the Bulgarian<br />ask Brooks to bring him a fake egg?
4390520 4393512 Uh, I don't think he wanted<br />an egg at all.
4393600 4396592 I think he wanted<br />what was inside the egg.
4397560 4399676 "WITSEC." What is that?
4399800 4400835 Um...
4400920 4402592 We could ask them?
4419920 4421797 You tell anyone<br />we were coming here?
4421960 4423279 No.
4423440 4424589 I've got your egg.
4424680 4425680 You do?
4425760 4427239 Yeah, but we broke it.
4427400 4428833 - What?<br />- Well, it was a fake.
4428960 4430576 But we have the list of names<br />that was inside.
4430600 4431999 That's what you wanted, right?
4435400 4437470 Okay. Get on the ground.
4437560 4439416 We've got what you want.<br />Can't you just let us go?
4439440 4441715 I said, "On the ground!"
4442640 4444416 You, too, playboy, get over there.<br />Get on the ground.
4444440 4445555 Yeah.
4445640 4447440 None of that<br />child pose bullshit, either.
4448040 4450600 The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,<br />probably you guys, too.
4450760 4451988 Why did you come here?
4452280 4454056 Because you're my brother,<br />and I can't just let you die,
4454080 4455256 even though you might deserve it.
4455280 4457396 Yeah, it's me. We got them all here.
4457560 4460154 You're unbelievable, you know that?
4460320 4462470 You've always<br />been a better person than me.
4462640 4464232 You gotta shut up. Okay?
4464400 4467312 Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.
4467480 4470153 I'm not the carefree dude<br />that wins at everything he touches.
4470240 4472674 You know how I win?<br />I cheat. I cheat at everything.
4472760 4474876 I even cheated when we were kids<br />playing Battleship.
4476600 4477828 What?
4477920 4481390 Didn't you ever wonder why I made you<br />sit with your back to the TV?
4481480 4484278 It was so I could see your ships<br />in the reflection.
4484360 4487875 I mean, I even took five grand<br />every time we played Monopoly
4487960 4489560 before we even started playing the game.
4489640 4493030 I cheated at the Game of Life.<br />And at the game of life.
4493200 4494519 You son of a bitch.
4494600 4496795 - You son of a bitch!<br />- Sit down.
4497880 4499896 - What about you, Princess?<br />- I don't have anything.
4499920 4503356 But it didn't stop there<br />because, when we grew up, Max,
4503440 4505715 you went off to college, and I...
4506800 4508836 You got a career.
4509040 4511634 You married the greatest girl<br />in the world.
4511800 4513631 I knew I couldn't keep up<br />with that success.
4513800 4515677 So I...
4515880 4517996 I told everyone that I got a job<br />on Wall Street.
4518160 4519559 And I did.
4519760 4522513 Selling coke to traders.
4523880 4525029 You didn't invest in Panera?
4525200 4526599 I ate at Panera.
4526760 4528318 Jesus Christ.
4528400 4530197 What's going on?
4530280 4532136 But that's why I've been trying<br />to make it up to you.
4532160 4533536 That's what this whole game night<br />was about.
4533560 4536552 See, I had it rigged<br />so that you'd finally win.
4537600 4540512 The last clue was gonna lead you...
4540600 4541919 Your jacket pocket.
4551680 4553113 Huh.
4555520 4557272 Surprise!
4560480 4563438 I even managed to fuck that up, though.<br />I'm so sorry.
4563520 4565511 I'm so sorry, Max.
4567400 4569550 I think we're gonna be okay, though.<br />I got a feeling.
4569640 4570834 You want us to kill them all?
4571920 4572955 What?
4573040 4574696 - Okay.<br />- Wait, wait. Just let us go.
4574720 4575896 We won't tell anyone anything.
4575920 4577680 We got you the list!
4577880 4580314 - What the fuck, man?<br />- Fuck! God damn it!
4582320 4583616 - Oh, shit. The fuzz.<br />- Fuck, man!
4583640 4584959 Freeze!
4585200 4586235 Gary?
4586320 4587416 Don't even think about it, pig.
4587440 4589000 Can't say I care for that nomenclature.
4592280 4593395 Get down!
4594240 4595992 Come on, bitch!
4597560 4598560 Motherfucker!
4603320 4604719 God damn it!
4612840 4614273 Hey, isn't that your neighbor?
4614760 4616016 When did Gary get so cool?
4616040 4617075 Oh, my God!
4617160 4618275 Everybody okay?
4618400 4620056 - You're a cool-ass cat, Gary.<br />- You all right?
4620080 4621672 Fine, thank you,
4622480 4626189 though, in sliding, my belt buckle<br />may have inadvertently scratched
4626280 4627838 the finish of my squad car.
4627920 4629512 How did you know we were in trouble?
4629600 4631750 The nocturnal Jenga game,
4632640 4634835 my blood-spattered marital souvenirs,
4634960 4638589 and Max's curious search history<br />piqued my interest.
4638680 4641035 - Right. Oh, God.<br />- You, uh...
4641120 4642838 You saved our lives.
4642920 4644069 Thank you.
4644720 4645960 Just doing my job.
4647760 4648909 - Oh, my God!<br />- Oh!
4649000 4651070 - Shit!<br />- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
4652280 4653315 Gary!
4654760 4656456 Hello? I need an ambulance.<br />Officer down.
4656480 4657976 - Oh, shit!<br />- Hang in there, pal.
4658000 4659353 Hang on. Hang on, pal.
4659440 4660616 Hang on. You're gonna be all right.
4660640 4661816 We're gonna get you to a hospital.
4661840 4663478 Okay, look at me. Gary, look.
4663560 4665516 You have got a lot to live for, okay?
4665600 4666600 Do I?
4666680 4668159 - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br />- Yeah.
4668240 4670117 I have no wife.
4671560 4673232 - No friends.<br />- That's not true.
4673400 4674515 No, don't say that.
4674680 4676536 - You got us. We're your friends.<br />- You've got us.
4676560 4681031 You don't even like<br />spending time with me.
4681120 4682439 Yes, we do. We just...
4682520 4684192 We've been a little selfish. That's all.
4684280 4686016 - Right, right.<br />- You know, I'm sorry about that.
4686040 4687040 Oh, God. Oh, God.
4687120 4688917 - Bastian.<br />- Huh?
4690280 4692874 Someone please take care of Bastian.
4692960 4696111 Gary, you are gonna take care of Bastian<br />yourself, okay?
4696200 4697376 Listen, soon as you get out<br />of the hospital,
4697400 4699480 you're gonna come to every single<br />game night we have.
4700600 4701919 Don't...
4702280 4703349 Yeah?
4703440 4706352 Don't you ever
4708200 4710191 exclude me again.
4710280 4713158 - Never exclude you again, pal.<br />- No.
4714920 4717229 - Oh, God. What is that?<br />- What's that?
4717320 4719276 Is that a blood clot?
4719840 4722149 It's a blood capsule.
4722240 4723912 - Huh?<br />- A blood capsule?
4724800 4728509 And that is how<br />you do a game night.
4732160 4733229 What?
4735360 4736998 I've duped you all.
4737080 4738080 Wha...
4739000 4742276 Hold on a second. Are you telling me<br />that this whole thing was a game?
4744840 4746068 - What? What?<br />- Damn!
4746160 4747160 Shit!
4747280 4748998 I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.
4749080 4751376 When I learned you stopped inviting me<br />to your game nights,
4751400 4754198 I hijacked<br />Brooks's murder mystery party,
4754280 4756111 and I staged a kidnapping of my own.
4756200 4757679 You gotta be kidding me.
4757760 4760957 What better way to prove my worth<br />as a game night participant?
4761040 4763076 Well, what about these dudes?<br />Are they actors?
4763160 4765116 Oh, no. They're... They're felons.
4765200 4766200 Felons?
4766280 4767936 I was able to shave some time off<br />of their parole
4767960 4770155 in exchange<br />for this little side project.
4770400 4771515 We square now?
4771600 4772919 Thank you, gentlemen.
4773000 4774274 That lady hit me with the car.
4774360 4775976 Hey, what the hell kind of psycho<br />are you?
4776000 4778594 You put us through all this,<br />just for your own amusement?
4778680 4782036 No, no. Just the opposite.<br />For your amusement.
4782120 4783269 Did everyone have fun?
4783400 4785038 - No! No.<br />- Yeah. No.
4785120 4786758 No fun! I got shot!
4786840 4787909 By me!
4788000 4790560 I don't see how that's possible.<br />My men were using blanks.
4790640 4792596 Well, that was my gun.<br />It was a real gun.
4792680 4795353 So, this whole thing, the Fabergé egg,
4795440 4796953 the Bulgarian, that was you?
4798640 4799709 You've lost me.
4799800 4801950 The egg, the WITSEC list?
4802040 4804076 It's all you. All part of your game?
4807680 4810256 This is a list of people in<br />the Federal Witness Protection program.
4810280 4811395 How did you get this?
4811480 4813869 From inside the egg.<br />Stop fucking with us. It's over!
4813960 4816679 I'm not fudging with you.<br />I honestly have no idea what...
4818680 4821035 Oh, boy. Yikes!
4821920 4823696 - I mean, how stupid do you think we are?<br />- Hey, Max.
4823720 4825756 Gang, are we looking<br />at the big twist here?
4825840 4827353 He gets shot again!
4827440 4830096 And by who? A couple of new characters<br />you introduce at the last minute.
4830120 4831633 Dude, you've jumped the shark!
4831720 4833312 Do you go to the magic shop
4833400 4835640 - to buy a bunch of these little bullets?<br />- No.
4837720 4839073 Hang on.
4839160 4842118 This is Officer Kingsbury.<br />We got a 10-00 on the 4th Street.
4845120 4847350 Which one of you is Brooks Davis?
4850160 4852799 It's funny.<br />You don't look like an asshole.
4853560 4855596 Do I look like an asshole to you?
4856160 4857229 No.
4857320 4859595 One of us has to be the asshole<br />in this transaction
4859680 4862274 because otherwise I'd have my egg,<br />and you'd have your money.
4862360 4865716 But instead, we've wasted our night<br />tracking you down.
4867480 4869198 Now, we're gonna have to kill you.
4869280 4870918 - What? No, no, no, no.<br />- What?
4871280 4872713 Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?
4872880 4875758 Hi, I'm Max.<br />I'm Brooks's brother.
4875840 4877910 And, you know, look. He screwed up.
4878000 4879256 - Right? You got greedy.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4879280 4880315 He admits it.
4880400 4882277 Good news is, though,<br />that we got your egg.
4882760 4885115 It is broken. Uh, my screw up.
4885200 4887668 But, um, I got the list.
4887760 4889560 which I bet you've been after<br />this whole time.
4889640 4890640 What about this?
4890720 4892631 How about
4893280 4897273 you take this list for free,<br />and we all go our separate ways?
4897360 4899316 Nobody gets hurt.
4899400 4902358 Uh, except the poor folks on this list,<br />I'm guessing.
4904560 4905675 Okay.
4906360 4907360 Okay?
4907480 4910040 Deal. Makes perfect sense.
4910120 4912120 No, no. You give him that list,<br />he's gonna kill me.
4912160 4913479 That's nonsense.
4916400 4918231 What the hell is wrong with you?
4918720 4920676 I'm just trying to buy myself some time.
4920760 4923832 Not much. We're just gonna<br />cut it out of you on the jet. Take him.
4927400 4929072 Don't follow us, Max. I'm serious!
4929160 4931276 I'm not worried about that.
4934920 4936399 You just letting them go?
4936480 4938550 Yeah, they've done nothing wrong.
4938680 4940671 Only this one.
4941000 4942433 - Let's go.<br />- Don't follow us!
4942520 4944556 Gary! He's breathing.
4945720 4947976 You know, the only private air terminal<br />around here is at Conway.
4948000 4949558 Yeah. How are we gonna get there?
4950080 4951536 Brooks's house is<br />not that far from here.
4951560 4952675 But our car's not there.
4953880 4955029 Yeah, it is.
4964920 4967639 You know, you don't have to do this<br />because I can just poop it out.
4968480 4971790 We're not gonna go digging<br />through your feces. That's disgusting!
4971920 4973956 Now, hold still<br />while I cut your stomach open.
4974040 4975359 No, no! No! Whoa!
4976640 4977914 What the hell?
4980200 4981997 - Is that...<br />- That's my brother.
4982080 4983638 Get us in the air.
4983720 4984720 Now!
4995840 4996875 - Hold on!<br />- Oh!
5000520 5001794 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, you?
5001880 5002995 - Yup, good.<br />- Okay.
5007680 5009272 Okay, okay. What's our plan?
5009360 5010759 I have one idea.
5010840 5013115 It's so crazy, though, baby,<br />it just might work.
5013200 5014376 You're gonna<br />crash the car into the plane,
5014400 5016231 like Liam Neeson in Taken 3?
5016600 5018192 He did that in Taken 3, huh?
5022760 5024680 - All right, are you ready? Here we go!<br />- Uh-huh.
5026240 5027832 Oh, my God!
5031200 5032952 Uh, you missed it.
5033040 5034189 Thanks, baby.
5039280 5040349 Brooks, we're coming!
5040440 5041509 Whoo!
5059760 5063230 Well, at least I got<br />to drive it for 10 minutes.
5065480 5066595 Oh, my God.
5066760 5067875 - We have to hide.<br />- Yeah.
5068040 5069155 Okay. Go.
5069240 5072391 Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!
5072640 5074198 Go, go, go! It's stuck.
5075560 5076629 Fuck!
5077560 5078959 God damn it!
5096920 5098194 Where you at, lady?
5098280 5100271 Come on, you little bitch.
5101240 5103071 I know you're back here somewhere.
5104600 5107398 Let's end this shit.<br />I won't kill you. Come out!
5108440 5110317 Come on, get your ass out here!
5110480 5111708 Turn on the belt!
5111800 5112800 What?
5112880 5114256 - I'm not gonna hurt you.<br />- Look at the box!
5114280 5116669 - Let's talk!<br />- Can you charade it to me?
5116760 5118591 Charades?
5119200 5121395 That's some cute full-circle bullshit.
5121480 5123118 Here we go. Three words.
5123240 5124355 Come on, lady.
5124440 5125475 Where are you?
5127920 5128955 Turn.
5129040 5130234 Turn, turn, turn. Turn.
5130720 5131755 On.
5131840 5134673 Turn on. Turn on what? Turn on what?
5136200 5138270 Turn on belt?
5138440 5141000 Turn on belt!
5149960 5152190 Boy, that's a slow belt.
5163160 5164673 Hey!
5165040 5167349 Oh, God! Annie!
5170040 5171598 Oh, boy, that was...
5171680 5172896 You saw what I was going for,<br />though, right?
5172920 5173920 Yeah, yeah.
5174040 5176336 But then did you see when I hit him<br />with the fire extinguisher?
5176360 5178616 - I sure did. I sure did, yeah.<br />- That was cool, right? Yeah.
5178640 5179709 - Yeah.<br />- Great.
5179800 5180800 Do you want this?
5180920 5183115 Well, I don't want you to have it,<br />Calamity Jane.
5183200 5184394 All right, look.
5184480 5186755 I think I saw a hatch<br />at the top of the plane.
5186840 5188159 Maybe I can get the drop on him.
5188240 5189673 - "The drop"?<br />- Yup, yeah.
5189760 5190760 Who are you?
5190840 5191936 Why don't you go use<br />the emergency phone? Call for help.
5191960 5192960 I'm gonna do the drop.
5193040 5194996 Okay. You're not Liam Neeson!
5195080 5196991 - That hurts my feelings!<br />- I'm sorry!
5207160 5208832 That's enough of this shit.
5228880 5229880 Max!
5231360 5232776 I can't get the drop on anyone tonight.
5232800 5233994 Put that little knife down!
5234080 5235672 Right now! That's it.
5236120 5237712 Ahh!
5238120 5240080 Right in my bullet hole.
5245000 5246752 Come on, come on, come on.
5250560 5251560 Shit!
5256160 5257160 Stop!
5258480 5259799 Drop it!
5261640 5262675 Wait, wait. Um...
5263040 5266589 You don't have to do this.<br />I have kids at home.
5267200 5268679 Not with that ass you don't.
5269080 5270195 Oh.
5270280 5271918 Well, thank you.
5272240 5273309 You're welcome.
5276280 5278396 Shit!
5280240 5281673 Yes!
5282480 5284471 Oh, no, he died!
5315080 5317594 And that's how<br />you get the drop on someone!
5317680 5318749 Oh, my God!
5319600 5320999 Oh. Oh!
5321080 5322957 - I got you! I got you!<br />- This is high.
5324720 5325755 You're amazing.
5325840 5327400 - You can cut me loose now.<br />- Thank you!
5327520 5328714 Okay. Okay, okay.
5328880 5330632 - Uh...<br />- Yeah. In the bag.
5330800 5332600 - This? Okay.<br />- Look in the bag. That's right.
5332840 5334068 Okay.
5334480 5335515 Oh! Thank you!
5335600 5337556 - Okay. You all right?<br />- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
5340440 5341509 Whoa.
5341600 5342874 Well, look at that.
5343080 5344718 You put a bungee cord in your hand,
5344800 5346756 you go straight to the pervy place,<br />don't you?
5346880 5347880 Hey.
5347960 5349678 You saved my life. Thank you.
5350160 5351559 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
5351640 5354154 I mean, I just saw a man die,<br />but I'm... I'm okay.
5355560 5357437 Is that a knife in your bullet hole?
5357520 5359158 Uh-huh. Hey. I wanna have a baby.
5359720 5360835 Uh, what?
5360920 5362216 I used to think that<br />I wanted Brooks' life,
5362240 5363912 but, you know, turns out he was just...
5364000 5365558 You're a loser. He's a loser.
5365640 5366675 Uh, guilty.
5366760 5368273 But us making a family?
5368480 5371517 That's... That's not pellets.<br />That's the fruit.
5371680 5373398 That's fruit. It's fruit.
5373480 5374799 Wait. What's going on?
5375080 5377355 Plus, think about all the dumdums<br />that have kids, right?
5377440 5380096 And think about how much better<br />our kid is gonna be than their kids.
5380120 5381951 It's gonna beat their kids<br />at everything.
5382080 5383593 It's taken you this long to see that?
5383680 5385591 Our baby is gonna crush<br />every other baby.
5385680 5387656 That's right. That's right.<br />And not in that "peak too early,"
5387680 5388976 you know, "kid actor" kind of way,<br />you know?
5389000 5390000 Mmm-mmm. No.
5390080 5392036 We will parcel out<br />his or her gifts over time.
5392120 5393189 - Absolutely.<br />- Yes.
5393280 5394616 We gotta teach it Mandarin right away.
5394640 5395680 'Cause China's the future.
5395760 5396988 - It sure is.<br />- Yeah.
5397080 5398798 - You're the future.<br />- Oh, my God.
5402200 5403713 Hmm?
5404680 5407114 And that concludes my game night.
5407920 5409194 What?
5409280 5410376 It went exactly as I planned.
5410400 5413472 You learned every lesson<br />that I wanted you to.
5413560 5415391 Trevor, you can get up now.
5420600 5423320 I'm just fucking with you, but that<br />would've been really cool, right?
5423360 5424800 You're such a dick.
5434560 5436596 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Hey!
5437840 5439273 - Hey, hey!<br />- Hey!
5439440 5442273 Come on, come on. Hey, thanks<br />for letting me host again, huh?
5442440 5444237 Well, it's not like we had a choice.
5444400 5446152 Only 36 months to go.
5446320 5447576 Oh, time will fly.
5447600 5448856 - Can I get you a beer?<br />- Uh, yeah.
5448880 5450438 - Come on!<br />- Hey, listen, Brooks.
5450840 5453559 I know you're probably feeling<br />pretty humbled by all of this.
5453640 5456916 But, honestly, I think you're gonna come<br />out the other side a much better man.
5457320 5458469 Oh! Hey, look.
5458560 5459959 I completely agree.
5460040 5461712 You remember the WITSEC list<br />I swallowed?
5461800 5462994 - Sure.<br />- I pooped it out,
5463120 5465793 sold it for $3 million<br />on the black market.
5466680 5468511 - Are you serious?<br />- Pretty sweet, huh?
5469240 5471240 Brooks, everybody on that list<br />is gonna get killed.
5471400 5472719 Oh, no, Max, I'm not a monster.
5472920 5475115 I tipped everyone off<br />that they were in danger.
5475280 5477236 For $20,000 apiece.
5478360 5479696 You're unbelievable.
5479720 5482154 Thank you. It's not like<br />I'm gonna live in this dump forever.
5482240 5484936 As soon as this cuff comes off,<br />I'm gonna buy that house I was renting.
5484960 5486279 I'm moving in with Johanna.
5486880 5487949 There she is.
5488040 5489075 Hey, Dr. Chin!
5489160 5490639 Hey, Max.
5490720 5492073 - Let's play.<br />- Yeah.
5492880 5494029 Uh, The Crying Game?
5494440 5495475 Uh, Boys Don't Cry?
5495560 5497471 Is that a tear? No, is that the actor?
5497640 5498976 - Mr. Potato Head.<br />- Are you drawing the actor?
5499000 5500069 - Cry-Baby?<br />- Yes!
5500200 5501269 Time!
5501360 5503237 - It was The Green Mile.<br />- What?
5503320 5504878 How is that The Green Mile?
5505480 5507914 This is me at the Regal Cinema crying
5508040 5510508 as I did through much of the film.
5511600 5513200 How were we supposed to know that, Gary?
5513240 5516437 I assume everyone cried<br />during The Green Mile.
5517400 5518400 So, who's next?
5518480 5519480 I'll go.
5519560 5520879 - Yeah!<br />- Go, baby!
5520960 5522096 - Yeah!<br />- Nice try, Gary.
5522120 5523633 And go!
5524200 5525235 Uh...
5525320 5526976 - It's a rock.<br />- A bean? A rock!
5527000 5528274 - A ball?<br />- That's a...
5528360 5529776 - Burger. Is that a burger?<br />- Football! Football!
5529800 5531376 No, oh,<br />that's a dinner roll, right?
5531400 5532594 - A bun!<br />- Bread?
5532680 5534477 Is it a bun? Looks like a bun.
5534560 5535560 French loaf?
5535640 5537816 - Is this a motion picture?<br />- Bun is in a house. On a train.
5537840 5539056 Aren't you supposed<br />to announce it?
5539080 5540936 - Microwave?<br />- It's being cooked. It's in an oven.
5540960 5542496 - Bun in the oven!<br />- Yes, yes, yes!
5542520 5545398 Wait. What?
5545800 5547233 Yes.
5548360 5549429 You pregnant?
5549520 5550999 We did it.
5559120 5561395 Oh, my gosh!<br />They're having a baby!
5561480 5563118 They're having a baby!
5972720 5973994 How you doing?
5974080 5975991 - Hi.<br />- I'm Kenny.
5976080 5977672 Nice to meet you, Kenny.
5978920 5981832 Usually people cut me off<br />and say they know who I am.
5981920 5985037 - Oh, yeah?<br />- Yeah. I didn't catch your name.
5985880 5987393 I'm Debbie.
