41360 44750 Whoo!
44840 47035 Who cares about<br />winning? Let's get drunk!
47720 49199 Let's do it.
49280 51748 Let's get you drunk, Merkins.<br />You, too, Borgs.
51840 53671 I'm thirsty. Huh?
54880 57189 I need four shots of vodka,<br />four shots of water.
57280 59176 I want you to send the vodka<br />over to the Merkins.
59200 60918 Send the water to us. You understand?
61001 62697 What former<br />Supreme Court Justice...
62721 64313 - Oliver Wendell Holmes!<br />- Correct.
64401 65754 Yes!
65841 68480 Again, I'd like to ask the players<br />to allow me to...
68561 70199 T o finish the question.
70361 71714 Very funny.
71921 73912 Okay, okay.<br />This is getting embarrassing,
74001 75878 so we need to focus
76041 77474 because this isn't a game.
77681 79160 It literally is.
79321 81596 Bill, do not test me right now.
81681 83361 Looks like<br />we're down to two teams.
83761 85911 So, for double points,
86001 88276 what is the name<br />of the purple Teletubby?
89081 91641 - Tinky Winky!<br />- You're both correct.
93121 94759 He always carried a...
94921 96673 - Red purse.<br />- Yeah.
96841 99480 - And he loved big hugs.<br />- Big hugs.
99641 101552 I know. I'm Max.
101721 103074 Annie.
121121 123137 Ha-ha! You're never gonna be able<br />to hold on to Asia! You hear me?
123161 125311 Hey, if you take Kamchatka,<br />and I take Mongolia,
125521 126881 we could trap Linda in the middle.
126921 128057 - Starve out her armies.<br />- Hey!
128081 129230 You can't form alliances.
129441 131079 Worked for Hitler, right? Hmm?
131241 132959 You're high-fiving Hitler?
135281 137112 All right, you got this. Last one.
137801 140440 Oh, that's Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn.
140641 141790 Yes!
141961 142961 I'm up. I feel good.
143161 144196 Two words.
144361 145874 Bill. Overweight.
146081 147196 - No.<br />- Single. Out of work.
147281 148281 What the fuck?
148361 149680 Hairy.
149841 151320 Uh, carry, marry.
151481 152550 Marry!
152721 154359 You. Me.
154441 155441 Marry me?
155521 157161 Dude, we got it! We got it!
157641 159711 Annie, will you?
159801 161280 Will you marry me?
161361 162841 - Is that a yes? That's a yes!<br />- Yeah!
162961 165111 I'm really happy for you guys.
179001 180721 - Ooh, lot of pressure here.<br />- Yeah.
180801 182121 You miss, you lose it all.
182201 183236 Stay out of my head.
183321 185257 And you know you have a distinct<br />advantage with the smaller hands, right?
185281 186760 Your goal posts are not as big.
186921 188697 Well, I guess you<br />should've married Uma Thurman.
188721 189961 Yeah, that would've been great.
190001 192201 There's a snap. Here's the hold.
192801 194280 - Ooh!<br />- And a text.
194361 195555 That was interference.
195641 197297 Sorry, honey. I know how much<br />that meant to you.
197321 198879 Come on.
198961 200280 Dr. Chin is ready for you.
200361 201430 Uh, great.
201521 204194 I think we've determined why you've<br />been having trouble conceiving.
204361 206955 - Okay. Let's have it.<br />- Okay, great.
207121 209316 Oh, what's that look? Is it me?<br />Of course, it's me.
209401 211471 I'm not loving your semen.
211561 212630 Oh?
212721 215713 Your count is excellent,<br />but your motility is well below normal.
215881 217758 - That's too bad.<br />- What would cause that?
217921 220754 It can be genetic,<br />environmental factors.
220921 223230 Nine times out of 10, though,<br />it's psychological.
223401 225915 Have you been feeling<br />anxious or stressed?
226121 228237 No, I don't think so. Not really.
228401 229880 Uh... He's always a little stressed.
230801 232057 You don't have to write... I'm not...
232081 233241 Honey, she's writing it down.
233361 236592 Well, Max is very competitive. As am I.
236721 237721 We sure are.
237841 239417 One of the reasons<br />I fell in love with him.
239441 243275 Maybe, uh, that makes him a little more<br />prone to stress than normal people.
243441 245352 "Normal people"?
245441 246777 How long has this been going on, Max?
246801 247995 It's not going on.
248481 250949 Oh, well, you did say,<br />even when you were a kid,
251041 253111 you would freak out<br />if you lost at anything.
253561 255817 - Oh, I was a kid.<br />- Especially if you lost to your brother.
255841 256956 Hmm.
257601 259398 Hey, is that what this is?
259481 260481 No.
260561 264270 You have been so uptight since you<br />found out that Brooks is coming to town.
264361 265937 - I don't think that's true.<br />- Could that be a factor in all this?
265961 266961 Let's be fair.
267041 269350 Sibling rivalry can be very powerful.
269441 271511 Cain and Abel, the Baldwins.
271681 273273 - The what?<br />- The brothers.
273441 276001 I'm not sure why we're discussing this.<br />She's not a therapist.
276161 278152 You're not a therapist, right?<br />With all respect.
278321 279834 - No, but I am a doctor.<br />- Sure.
279921 281877 And I believe in<br />treating the whole patient.
281961 285033 So, what is it about your brother<br />that makes you feel emasculated?
285201 286634 Are we gonna do this?
286801 288617 We're right next to the room<br />where I masturbated.
288641 292031 I think he has it in his head<br />that Brooks is cooler
292121 295193 and more successful<br />and hotter than he is.
295281 296555 I never said hotter.
296721 298200 He's charming.
298401 300676 That's interesting. And is he single?
300841 301841 What's that?
301921 305197 I don't know if I mentioned it, but<br />Keith and I are on a trial separation.
305281 306600 - Oh.<br />- Keith?
307161 308196 Uh, Keith.
308281 310537 So, do you think your brother would<br />wanna grab a cup of coffee with me?
310561 311630 Gosh, I don't know.
311801 313200 Well, it doesn't hurt to ask.
313361 314794 Hurts a little.
315001 317390 Now, is he a tall fellow?<br />'Cause I'm only 5'2".
317561 318914 We're all done with my semen?
319081 320514 He is taller than Max.
320681 322911 - Good.<br />- But he did date this ballerina once,
323001 324798 and she was<br />just a teeny-tiny little thing.
344001 345275 Ooh.
345361 347716 Honey, Gary.<br />Don't mention game night, okay?
347801 348836 Mmm-hmm.
348921 350718 - Good evening, Max.<br />- Hey, Gary.
350881 352075 - Annie.<br />- Hello there.
352241 353833 Hi, Gary!
354321 355834 Just checking the mail.
355921 356956 Oh, yeah?
357041 358617 Some people check it earlier in the day,
358641 362475 but there's always a risk<br />that the mail carrier hasn't come yet.
363481 367838 This spares me the chance<br />of a futile trip to the mailbox.
369481 370630 Uh-huh.
370721 375033 Plus, it allows Bastian here<br />the opportunity to urinate.
376121 377839 You have a good one.
378001 379195 Any plans for this evening?
379361 380635 No.
381281 382680 Perhaps a game night?
382841 384240 We're just gonna stay in,
384361 385635 - just the two of us.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
385721 387313 - Boring.<br />- Mmm.
387481 388800 I see.
390001 394836 I do hope you keep me in mind<br />for any future game nights.
395041 396041 You bet.
396121 399830 I've always enjoyed<br />the camaraderie of good friends
400041 402953 competing in games of chance and skill.
403521 406274 Yeah.<br />Yeah, well, we'll do that,
406441 410070 but tonight, it's just the two of us.
410681 413753 Three bags of Tostitos Scoops, I notice.
419641 421950 There was a special on these tonight.
422441 423590 Three for one.
423761 425160 Three for one?
425801 426836 Yup.
426921 429116 How can that be profitable<br />for Frito Lay?
430361 432238 These corporations,
433601 435441 I don't know what they're doing.
435841 438401 Well, you two enjoy each other.
439201 443672 It's often we don't appreciate<br />what we have until it's gone.
448081 449673 - I think that's it.<br />- Okay.
449881 450996 Bye-bye!
457281 459511 If Gary sees the others coming,<br />we're screwed.
459681 460937 No, no, honey,<br />it's not gonna be a problem.
460961 463077 I was very, very clear with everyone<br />to park far away
463241 465118 and just to sneak in quietly, you know.
465281 467795 But now, I mean, you don't think<br />we're being dicks, do you?
467961 469417 I mean,<br />should we just still invite the guy?
469441 470657 He really seemed like he wanted to play.
470681 472512 No, no. Debbie was our friend,
472681 474857 and Gary was just the creepy husband<br />that we had to put up with.
474881 475881 That's true.
475961 477497 He's only gotten worse<br />since the divorce.
477521 480274 Yeah, we don't owe him anything, right?<br />Fuck him!
506881 507996 Hi!
508161 509560 Hi.
512961 514553 Can we help you?
514721 515915 I'm okay.
516281 517281 Hey!
517441 519377 Of course. Ryan, why are you<br />coming in through the window?
519401 522677 You said sneak in<br />so RoboCop wouldn't see us.
522841 524201 I meant sneak in through the door.
524321 525515 Well, you were super vague.
525681 526921 - I wasn't vague at all.<br />- Wine?
527041 528617 I know I didn't say,<br />"Break the succulents."
528641 530871 - Hey.<br />- I'm not dressed for this nonsense.
530961 531961 This is ridiculous.
532041 533097 It's like<br />Night of the Living Dead in here.
533121 534721 Yeah, you are asking a lot from us, Max.
534801 536217 I didn't say<br />to come through the window.
536241 537761 This is Max. We used to work together.
537881 539017 - His wife, Annie. Michelle.<br />- Hey!
539041 540041 And that guy, Kevin.
540121 541217 - What's up, buddy?<br />- The door was right there.
541241 542276 Guys, this is Madison.
542361 543714 Yeah, you brought her last week.
543881 545758 You work at Forever 21, right?
545921 547957 - No, no.<br />- I work at Sephora.
548041 550396 - I'm confused.<br />- Different girl.
550561 551880 Same look, same voice.
552041 553110 Nice to meet you.
553321 554841 You, too.
557081 558560 - That's yours.<br />- It's...
558721 560712 No. I think you're<br />supposed to kiss it, right?
560881 561916 Welcome.
562041 563474 Do you guys have a bathroom?
563641 565017 There's one just down the hall.<br />You need it?
565041 568192 Okay, is it on the right or the left?<br />I don't wanna go in the wrong room.
568361 569510 The one with the toilet.
569681 570750 - Can't miss it.<br />- Okay.
573561 574994 - Oh, boy.<br />- Dude!
575161 577197 - Wow. Where'd you find her? TED Talk?<br />- Right?
577361 578635 No, at Chipotle.
578801 579857 Let me ask you something, Ryan.
579881 581577 Aren't you sick of<br />losing game night every week
581601 582777 because of the dates you bring?
582801 584712 They're not always that bad.
587881 588916 Heather, seriously.
589001 591161 How many photos of you<br />with the dog filter do you need?
592881 595031 Uh... "Dennis" isn't a word.
595241 597801 Uh, yeah, it is.<br />It's my daddy's name, so...
597961 600714 These are the elite,<br />the very best, the...
600801 601870 Oh, oh! White people!
601961 603553 - What?<br />- Oh, Jesus.
603641 604835 Okay, unlike you psychos,
605041 606801 I don't give a shit<br />about winning game night.
607001 608480 I don't need that validation.
608641 610922 But you do need the validation<br />of dating Instagram models?
611041 612076 Absolutely.
612241 614550 I'm sorry. I'm sorry<br />I'm not like you, Michelle.
614721 617189 We didn't all meet our soul mate<br />when we were 10 years old.
617281 618281 14.
618361 619361 - Oh, sorry.<br />- 14.
619441 621161 And we didn't get married<br />until we were 19.
621241 622993 - See, that's gross.<br />- You know what, Ryan?
623081 625276 I hope one day you<br />get to meet a lovely, young lady.
625441 627897 So you can love her as much as<br />I love my sweet baby right here.
627921 629718 Yes, find her. Look how cute this...
629881 631177 - Hey, look at this.<br />- So much love.
631201 632257 Let's look at him when we do it.
632281 633777 - Hey, everybody, grab your drinks.<br />- Find the love!
633801 635029 Let's go play, come on.
635201 638477 Dude, do you know what rich people are<br />doing on their game nights these days?
638641 639960 What's that?
640161 641441 - Fight clubs.<br />- What?
641521 642670 I just read about them.
642841 644911 They pay poor people<br />to fight each other,
645041 646217 and then they bet on the winner.
646241 647961 - No, that's not a real thing.<br />- Yes, it is!
648081 649817 If you can have anything<br />you want in this world,
649841 651957 you have to raise the stakes,<br />or life gets boring.
652121 654321 The Kennedys used to have fight clubs<br />at their compound.
654401 657337 Honey, listen, you gotta stop reading<br />BuzzFeed every second of the damn day.
657361 659057 How about some charades?<br />Huh, should we start with charades?
659081 660137 - Let's go!<br />- Yeah!
660161 661310 It's been a while, huh?
661481 662880 Do you wanna wait for Brooks?
663041 664257 I don't think we need to. No, he's late.
664281 666556 - Wait, hold up. Brooks is in town?<br />- Yeah.
666721 667937 I thought he was working in Europe.
667961 670316 He was, yeah. He's apparently back<br />for some business.
670521 671521 Haven't seen him yet.
671681 673831 - But we can get started.<br />- Yeah!
674001 676097 - Who wants to start?<br />- Who are you guys talking about?
676121 678760 Max's brother. He's this super<br />successful venture capitalist.
678921 681481 Yeah, he was the first to invest<br />in Panera Bread, you know?
681641 683359 The Fuji Apple Salad was his idea.
683521 684921 - A lot of investors.<br />- Yeah.
685121 686841 He's like the Mark Wahlberg<br />to Max's Donnie.
686881 687916 Well...
688041 689110 Which is a huge compliment
689201 691715 because Donnie was fucking great<br />in The Sixth Sense, wasn't he?
691801 692916 He was.
693001 694400 Was he in The Sixth Sense?
694561 696801 He sure is, yeah.<br />You know who is not in The Sixth Sense?
696881 697996 Mark Wahlberg.
698161 700595 Mark would never take a role that small.
702281 704397 Is that right, Madison?
704561 705977 Man, I haven't seen him<br />since the wedding.
706001 707992 - Remember that speech he gave?<br />- Yes.
708161 709737 And then he paid<br />for that whole firework display!
709761 711017 - Oh, my gosh! The fireworks!<br />- Little over the top.
711041 712681 Let's get started.<br />I'm gonna start us off.
712721 714217 - Yes, let's start!<br />- Here we go. Let's do it.
714241 716017 We gotta pick teams first.
716041 717137 - Movie?<br />- It's a movie. Okay.
717161 718937 - Dude, we have no teams.<br />- You just give up?
718961 720474 Better not be Brooks.
734801 736917 You didn't tell him<br />to park up the street?
737081 740501 I did, yeah, like, three times.<br />Hey!
741561 743791 He got a Stingray, huh?
747161 748594 Turn off your car!
748921 750115 What's that?
752841 754320 Hello, again.
754721 755836 Mmm...
755921 757673 Still wearing the uniform.
759081 760434 Hey, bud, I'm sorry I'm late.
760601 762592 I hope you didn't start<br />game night without me.
764561 765710 Did you not get my text?
765881 767314 What text?
767761 769080 Oh, hello, Officer.
770921 772593 Why's that guy staring at us?
772761 774481 Gary, I want you<br />to meet my brother, Brooks.
774601 778071 We're having a little family<br />three-man game night tonight.
778241 779561 Wait, what do you mean three-man?
779641 781297 You said that Michelle<br />and Ryan and Kevin were...
781321 782800 No, no, no. Just gonna be us three.
782961 784161 I can see them in the doorway.
784241 786118 There's a whole mess of people.<br />Hey, guys!
786281 787714 - There they are.<br />- Hey!
787881 789155 These guys are leaving.
789241 790241 Take off, guys.
790321 792551 We had a little bit<br />of a mix-up with the, um...
793601 794875 - God damn it!<br />- What?
795041 796897 We didn't want him to know<br />that we're having a game night.
796921 800311 He used to come, and we don't<br />like him anymore, so...
800401 801629 Oh.
802041 803360 You know, I think he knows now.
803521 804670 He sure does.
804841 808277 Maxi Pad, come on, bring it in.
808761 811514 I haven't seen you in a year!
811681 814639 Hey, you smell good.
814801 817998 What is that? Is that Selsun Blue?<br />Head and Shoulders?
818161 819801 Why do you assume<br />it's a dandruff shampoo?
819961 822337 Well, I mean, you've always<br />been a little bit of a snowstorm.
822361 823817 - Hey, would you hold that for a second?<br />- Yup.
823841 824910 Hey, guys!
825081 827595 Well, you look good, stranger.
827801 828801 It's been forever.
828961 830633 I know, and that's my fault.<br />I'm so sorry.
830961 832189 Sweet ride, Brooks.
832361 834297 Oh, you like that?<br />I just got her a couple weeks ago.
834321 835470 What is that? A Corvette?
835641 838553 It's a 1976 rally red Stingray coupe.
838721 839915 It was my dream car as a kid.
840081 841992 And that's what<br />gave me the idea to get it.
842081 843958 You know what? I love your house.
845001 846116 Are you being sarcastic?
846321 847481 No, I mean I love your house.
847561 849199 It reminds me of Mom and Dad's.
849361 850794 Makes me think of simpler times.
850961 852314 "Simpler"?
852481 854392 Uh, so, how long are you in town for?
854481 855550 You know, I'm not sure.
855721 857120 It depends on how many clients
857201 859321 the firm's gonna be<br />having me schmooze while I'm here.
860401 861441 But hopefully for a while.
861521 863830 I don't get to see you guys, and I...
865601 868161 God, I really miss you, man.<br />I really do.
868241 869833 Oh.
870441 871920 Miss you, too, Brooks.
872281 873350 And go!
874161 875833 Shock-rocker. Dated Rose McGowan.
875921 877354 Oh! Ah, Marilyn Manson.
877561 878630 Yep. You got it.
878721 880632 - Quick story.<br />- There's no pausing.
880801 883497 You remember the urban myth where<br />Marilyn Manson had the ribs taken out
883521 884761 so he could go down on himself?
884921 885956 Yeah.
886041 887457 You don't mind me telling the story,<br />do you, Max?
887481 888601 You're in the middle of a...
888641 890836 You were 14 years old.<br />It's an adorable story.
891001 892001 I forbid it.
892201 894351 I'm a little curious.
894521 896318 Did you blow yourself?
896601 898177 You know the bungee cords on roof racks?
898201 899201 Yeah.
899281 902318 Max took one of those bungee cords,<br />and he put it around his neck.
902481 903481 Here he goes.
903561 904937 And then he wrapped it behind his legs
904961 907236 so he could squish his face<br />down into his crotch,
907401 908914 but the problem was
909081 911675 that it got stuck!<br />He couldn't unhook it.
912561 914631 And about an hour later
914801 917076 Mom comes home, and she finds him there.
917241 918276 Shit!
918441 920401 Her little pretzel boy<br />on his bedroom floor naked.
920961 922681 Little pretzel boy?
922721 924598 Great story. Are we back on now?
924761 926035 So?
926361 927361 "So" what?
927521 928636 Did you suck it?
929001 930417 Let's go. Come on. Brooks.
930441 931841 Back to it. Come on. Play the game.
932601 934398 Poor man's Johnny Depp,<br />starred in Jericho.
934561 935914 Skeet Ulrich.
936441 938830 UN Secretary General '92 to '96.
939041 940081 Oh, Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
940521 943319 This guy. He hated kids<br />in Jurassic Park.
943481 944481 Uh, Sam Neill.
944641 946393 Dubstep DJ, looks like Corey Feldman.
946481 947481 - Skrillex.<br />- Yep.
947561 949631 - Rappers love this Cubist painter.<br />- Picasso!
949841 952161 - Big cat shot by asshole dentist.<br />- Cecil the lion!
952281 953634 Time!
953721 954790 - How many?<br />- Seven!
954881 955916 Seven!
958441 959669 You're up, pretzel boy.
959841 960841 Whoo! Go, Max!
961081 962992 - Come on, Max.<br />- All right. Here we go.
963161 964958 And kick it. Go!
966721 967721 Oh, this is easy!
967801 971350 Annie, the famous actor that we met<br />at the airport about eight years ago.
972761 973761 Who?
973921 976001 Only actor we've ever met<br />at an airport who's famous.
976441 977556 Bobby Flay?
977721 980679 Not an actor. This fellow was<br />in front of us at the Sbarro.
980841 983122 We were wondering why he<br />wasn't in the first-class lounge.
983281 984839 Oh, yes, yes.
985361 986361 Who was that?
986521 987556 God damn it!
987641 989177 Max, there's a whole room of people<br />to help you out here.
989201 990270 - Use us.<br />- Good point.
990801 992401 He was the Incredible Hulk.
992561 993596 Eric Bana.
993801 995712 - Other one.<br />- Um, Mark Ruffalo.
995881 997241 - Other one.<br />- Lou Ferrigno.
997361 999352 Holy shit! Primal Fear.
999561 1001361 Richard Gere never played<br />the Incredible Hulk.
1001441 1003352 - Time.<br />- Motherfucking Ed Norton!
1003481 1004630 Oh!
1004721 1005756 Primal Fear!
1005921 1007070 Oh, my God!
1007241 1008241 He was the Hulk.
1008361 1009919 - The Hulk.<br />- I forgot that.
1010001 1011798 Max. Zero points.
1011961 1014794 I'd say he blew it,<br />but he won't tell us, will he?
1017441 1019193 Shit! Did you?
1019361 1021397 I can't believe I didn't get Bob Barker.
1021561 1024633 Hey, guys! What do you say<br />we do this at my house next week?
1025041 1026257 - House? What house?<br />- Ooh. Really?
1026281 1028801 Since I don't know how long<br />I'm gonna be here, I rented a place.
1028961 1030360 It's only a couple miles away.
1030521 1031874 You know, it's up on Broadmoor.
1032041 1033474 Oh! Swanky neighborhood.
1033641 1036201 It's a very cool house,<br />but it's just me there alone.
1036361 1038272 It'd be great<br />to have you guys come over.
1038441 1042070 Oh, well, it's kind of a tradition<br />to have game nights here.
1042241 1043435 But you know what?
1043641 1045552 Let's let him show off<br />his big house, huh?
1045721 1046995 That's the spirit!
1047161 1048435 Trust me.
1049841 1053390 This will be a game night to remember.
1054081 1055275 - Oh, boy.<br />- Mmm.
1055361 1056396 Promise?
1056481 1058537 Good night, everybody.<br />I love you much. Drive safely.
1058561 1059676 - Kisses!<br />- All right.
1059841 1061399 - Take it easy.<br />- Bye.
1061561 1064200 That little motherfucker.
1064561 1065676 Whoa!
1065761 1067956 Well, I mean, come on.
1068121 1070112 We don't see him in over a year.
1070281 1072841 He shows up in your dream car,
1073001 1075879 insults our house, and then tells<br />an embarrassing story about you
1076041 1078201 right before your turn<br />just to throw you off your game.
1078321 1081041 Welcome to my whole life. Why are you<br />suddenly so worked up about it?
1081201 1082921 Well, cause now<br />he's messing with your balls
1083081 1085037 and literally killing<br />millions of our babies.
1085201 1086839 Well, that's a little dramatic,
1087001 1088957 but, yeah, you know,<br />I mean, that's Brooks.
1089121 1091281 I thought that this<br />was just regular old brother stuff,
1091361 1092657 - but I totally see it now.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1092681 1094592 He undermines you every chance he gets.
1094681 1095796 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
1095881 1097758 - It's crazy!<br />- Thank you, Annie.
1097921 1100037 You know, I've never won<br />a single game against him.
1100241 1101241 I just...
1101321 1103915 I think we gotta fix this Brooks thing.
1105201 1106395 - Fix it?<br />- Yeah.
1106561 1107561 What are you suggesting?
1107721 1109791 I'm suggesting we beat his ass.
1110001 1111798 Jesus Christ.
1113201 1114953 Good evening.
1115121 1117032 We're gonna skip the cleanup?
1122441 1124159 Sure you don't wanna take a Lyft?
1124321 1126039 No, no. I am not getting drunk tonight.
1126201 1127537 - I'm gonna stay alert and ready.<br />- Evening!
1127561 1128721 Jesus, Gary!
1129761 1130910 Where are you headed?
1131081 1133720 We are going to, uh, to my brother's.
1134081 1136197 Another game night?
1136401 1138710 No. No, absolutely not.
1138881 1140473 We're going to, um,
1141401 1142436 have some dinner.
1142601 1143636 Eat.
1143761 1145194 I see.
1145521 1149230 Pity. I was going to invite you<br />over for a dinner I'm hosting.
1150081 1152914 I've purchased four lamb shanks
1153081 1157916 that I've been simmering<br />in a broth of red wine and rosemary.
1158281 1159953 That sounds so yummy, though.
1160041 1161041 Damn it.
1161121 1163316 It was actually Debbie's recipe.
1164801 1170637 I like to think she left behind her<br />recipe cards as a gesture of goodwill,
1172561 1176031 but it was most likely<br />an unintentional oversight.
1181361 1184239 Well, here we go.
1185601 1186875 What?
1187961 1189155 I'm sorry?
1190241 1192038 I thought you said something.
1192321 1194118 - No.<br />- Nope, not us.
1194561 1195596 Okay.
1198521 1200159 Have fun.
1203681 1205239 Oh, fuck me.
1206161 1207958 A guy who rents a house this big
1208121 1211238 must be making up for something<br />pretty small, I'd say.
1211401 1213790 No, no. No, I've seen his dick.<br />It's pretty great.
1213961 1215758 Well, I tried.
1217201 1218475 - Hey!<br />- Hey!
1218641 1219897 - Hey!<br />- How are you doing, beautiful?
1219921 1222355 - Good, good. Really fancy.<br />- Very nice house, Tony Stark.
1222521 1224601 Should we give<br />our drink orders to Jarvis?
1225041 1227794 No, I got the Tony Stark part,<br />but then you went full nerd on me.
1227961 1229537 I kind of lost you,<br />but please do come in.
1229561 1230561 All right.
1230641 1231710 - Thanks, Cap.<br />- Hi, guys!
1231801 1232801 What's up?
1232881 1236351 Boy, could sleep four<br />on that couch. Look at that.
1236441 1238159 Oh, hello, friends.
1238321 1241836 Hey, let me introduce you to my date.<br />This is Sarah.
1242001 1243992 Sarah is head of company accounting<br />at our office.
1244161 1245401 Well, corporate communications.
1245481 1248393 And she's also British,<br />which means she's smart as shit.
1248601 1250273 - I'm Irish.<br />- Okay? Same island.
1250441 1251556 Well, it's really not.
1251641 1252777 - Nice to meet you. Hi.<br />- Nice to meet you, too.
1252801 1253916 - I'm Max.<br />- Annie.
1254001 1256993 So, you can't always judge a book<br />by its past covers, can you?
1257161 1259197 - Mmm.<br />- Almost a saying.
1259401 1260521 - Here you go.<br />- Hey, Brooks.
1260641 1262137 - Cheers.<br />- We didn't know if you had any games,
1262161 1264391 so we thought we'd bring you<br />a few of our favorites.
1264561 1266074 Hey, look at that.
1266521 1268113 Whoa!
1268201 1269561 - Huh.<br />- The poor games.
1269601 1271512 I told you we're taking it up a notch.
1271681 1274639 The game that we're<br />gonna play tonight is so epic
1274801 1277156 that we don't need a board,<br />and we do not need pieces.
1277321 1279017 Still didn't need to throw them<br />across the room.
1279041 1280269 I was being theatrical.
1280441 1282193 Holy shit! Are we doing a fight club?
1282361 1283396 A what?
1283481 1285497 It's when rich people<br />pay poor people to fight each other...
1285521 1288017 Hey, hey, hey! Ryan, Ryan, Ryan.<br />Stop with the fight club, okay?
1288041 1289315 - It's nonsense.<br />- No.
1289481 1290880 Ryan believes everything he reads.
1291041 1292554 Thank you.
1292721 1294996 So, what are we playing?
1297521 1302151 In the next hour, someone in this room<br />is going to be taken.
1302361 1305319 And it's gonna be up to you to find them<br />before they are murdered.
1305481 1307437 Oh! It's a murder mystery party.
1307601 1309353 Not just any murder mystery.
1309521 1311057 I found this company.<br />They do it super real.
1311081 1312150 They use legit actors.
1312241 1315313 You're not gonna know<br />what's real and what's fake.
1315481 1317676 - Fun!<br />- But that's not all
1317841 1321993 because whoever finds the victim<br />wins the grand prize.
1323801 1325393 The keys to the Stingray.
1325561 1327153 - What?<br />- Wow.
1327321 1328959 Just the keys?
1329641 1331074 No, Ryan, the whole car.
1331241 1333357 Oh, yes! Oh, man!
1333561 1335177 You're so lucky I brought you<br />to this game night
1335201 1337271 - and not one of Max and Annie's.<br />- Hey!
1337481 1340041 - No, I just mean, 'cause this is better.<br />- Oh.
1340241 1342516 You're not gonna actually<br />give away your car?
1342681 1344114 Oh, it's just a tax write-off.
1344321 1346630 And the Audi, it's more practical.
1347081 1348514 Yeah, that makes sense to me.
1348681 1350751 Okay. How do we start?
1350921 1352673 We just wait for it to begin.
1352841 1355355 Maybe play a drinking game<br />to pass the time?
1355521 1357477 This group does not play drinking games.
1357641 1359677 Tonight we do, Max.
1360601 1362137 - Oh! "Never Have I Ever."<br />- Good one!
1362161 1363561 Can you believe this guy?
1363601 1365512 Yeah, he's ridiculous.
1365681 1367160 Beautiful house, though.
1367321 1368913 Good champagne.
1372921 1374673 Here we go.
1376081 1378356 Yup. We're at the house.
1378801 1381235 We'll let you know when we have him.
1396881 1398712 Jesus Christ!
1398881 1400599 What's with that knife?
1400801 1402393 It's for the cheese.
1402561 1405121 Okay, all right. Just, you know,
1405281 1407590 really aggressive way to carry a knife.
1408441 1409441 Oh, no, I've got one.
1409601 1413116 Never have I ever<br />connected my work computer
1413281 1416671 to the projector in the conference room<br />when it was open on a WebMD page
1416841 1417910 for chlamydia symptoms.
1418081 1419116 That's not cool!
1419281 1420396 Drink!
1420561 1422438 Just for the record,<br />I did not have chlamydia.
1422601 1425434 It was pubic dermatitis. You get it<br />from not washing your crotch, so...
1425601 1426777 - Okay.<br />- Good for you.
1426801 1428871 I... I like her.
1429281 1431297 And, listen, you're not supposed<br />to single people out in this game.
1431321 1433471 It's supposed to be generic things, like
1433641 1435393 "Never have I ever slept<br />with a celebrity."
1435561 1437392 Oh, I didn't know. Okay.
1437481 1438596 Whoops.
1438681 1439750 - Mmm?<br />- Ooh.
1442961 1443996 What?
1444081 1445878 You slept with a celebrity?
1446041 1448635 No, I was taking a drink<br />separate from the game.
1448721 1449857 - That was bad timing.<br />- Mmm.
1449881 1451481 I see how you would think, but it's not.
1451601 1454362 Well, then why are you breathing<br />like you just got off the elliptical?
1454801 1456473 I'm not. I'm...
1456921 1459196 Come on, babe.<br />Whose turn is it?
1459321 1461630 Uh, it's Max. Max, it's your turn. Huh?
1461801 1463678 I'm not playing a drinking game.<br />Who was it?
1463841 1464881 What's the deal with that?
1464921 1466097 They've been together<br />since middle school.
1466121 1467177 It's somebody else's turn.
1467201 1468201 - Oh. Oh!<br />- Yeah!
1468321 1470337 How could you possibly<br />have had sex with a celebrity
1470361 1472238 when we've only had sex with each other?
1472401 1474657 Please, can you not make this<br />one of your things right now?
1474681 1475841 How is this one of my things?
1476641 1479519 Yeah, Brooks, this is why<br />we don't play drinking games.
1482641 1484393 It looks like the game is afoot.
1484481 1485755 Oh!
1485881 1487360 Thank you, God!
1487521 1489477 Oh, boy. Let's buckle up, huh?
1491681 1493194 Brooks Davis?
1493481 1494516 Yes.
1494601 1496193 - Oh, shit.<br />- Ooh!
1496361 1497794 This is good.
1498481 1500312 Agent Henderson.
1501121 1502156 FBI.
1502321 1505040 Sunglasses at night. It's legit.
1505201 1506270 Sit down, please.
1507521 1509034 I'll get right to the point.
1509201 1513956 The Bureau has been tracking a ring<br />of violent kidnappers
1514121 1516237 in this very neighborhood.
1516961 1520317 And we have reason to believe<br />that one of you
1521601 1523114 may be their next victim.
1525121 1526337 That's terrible news.
1526361 1529637 Contained within these dossiers
1529841 1533436 are the clues you will require<br />to find the kidnappers.
1533601 1535557 You'd like for us to do that, yeah?
1536121 1538041 The Bureau's...<br />What's the Bureau's role in this?
1538121 1540017 Maybe you guys could take my wife<br />in for questioning
1540041 1541777 because, apparently, she got a<br />secret life I don't know nothing about.
1541801 1544076 - Baby, this is...<br />- Shut up, all of you!
1544161 1545310 Wow.
1546881 1548599 It's not a joke.
1548761 1551480 You people are in real danger,<br />and you're running out of time.
1551641 1555395 And I, Agent Henderson,<br />will not stand idly by
1555561 1559679 while innocent civilians<br />are slaughtered on my watch.
1559841 1561097 I told you<br />this is gonna be great.
1561121 1562952 - It's so good!<br />- So good.
1563161 1564297 But, uh, before we get started,
1564321 1566602 I'm required to ask if any of you<br />have any food allergies.
1567041 1568076 Peanuts?
1569081 1570230 Who the hell are you?
1571481 1573217 Now wait a second.<br />I know you're method and all,
1573241 1575537 but you can't just come in here<br />and break the door.
1575561 1577597 I do not mind this game.
1577801 1579359 Are you crazy?
1594361 1596113 It's very well done.
1597401 1598550 No!
1599241 1600833 That is a strong table.
1602001 1603434 Oh, watch out! He's packing heat!
1603601 1604636 Hell no!
1610161 1612117 Oh! Oh!
1635681 1636716 Come on!
1649961 1652475 You're just making this<br />harder on yourself!
1655561 1656561 Oh, shit!
1657481 1659915 Guys, make sure you<br />get a piece of this cheese. It's just...
1660081 1662390 - Cut me one.<br />- Try it with the quince.
1670121 1671520 Oh, my God!
1672121 1673156 Now he's back.
1673241 1674577 Stop fighting, asshole!
1674601 1675716 Help me! This isn't...
1675801 1678156 The Independent Spirit Award goes to...
1678401 1680121 Let's go!
1680361 1681361 Bye-bye!
1681521 1683079 First one that follows us gets shot!
1683281 1684919 Okay, roger that. You drive safe.
1685121 1686713 Come on, motherfucker!
1687121 1689271 - That was amazing.<br />- Really good.
1689441 1690760 - That was really good.<br />- Wow.
1691041 1695034 Mmm. No, there's something about this<br />that just doesn't feel right.
1695561 1697836 How could you cheat on me<br />with a celebrity?
1698001 1699036 I didn't cheat on you.
1699201 1701715 It was before we got married<br />when we took that break.
1701881 1704111 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
1704281 1705417 I've been living in The Matrix.
1705441 1708433 Agent Henderson,<br />you just gonna keep lying there?
1708641 1709721 Is any of this real?
1709801 1711393 Well, don't kick him!
1712001 1714041 - Stop.<br />- He's a regular Daniel Day-Lewis.
1714161 1715257 I thought we both agreed
1715281 1718159 that we wouldn't hook up<br />with anybody else during that break.
1718361 1720761 Yeah, but then you went<br />and got a hand job from Karen Waller.
1720841 1722657 - No, don't do that.<br />- Boop! Boop! Boop!
1722681 1724558 Because it was over the pants,<br />all right?
1724721 1728077 It was, and it hurt. It was very dry,<br />and I didn't climax.
1728241 1729897 Just admit it.<br />You guys did more than that.
1729921 1731832 Don't turn this around on me.<br />Do not do that.
1732041 1733201 Don't you Johnnie Cochran me!
1733521 1734577 Damn it, they got the jump on us.
1734601 1735601 - Come on.<br />- Shit, Kev!
1735681 1736681 Come on now!
1736761 1738577 All right. Here's the first clue.<br />Looks like a riddle.
1738601 1740080 "With shiny fangs..."
1740241 1741879 "My bloodless bite..."
1742041 1744839 "Will bring together<br />what's mostly white."
1745001 1746798 Donald Trump.
1746961 1750749 "Bloodless bite." It's not a vampire.<br />Um...
1750921 1752240 I'll just Google it.
1752401 1753641 It's so inconsistent, isn't it?
1753681 1755481 I mean, they stage<br />this super realistic fight.
1755601 1758434 They give us an FBI dossier<br />but with riddles.
1758601 1760537 It's like, let's pick a tone.<br />Let's stick with it.
1760561 1762457 But that's the game.<br />You wanna win this car or not?
1762481 1763880 Yeah, yeah. More than anything,
1764041 1765641 but I feel like Brooks is setting me up.
1765721 1767081 Do you get that feeling? You know,
1767241 1770711 that this is some game<br />where somehow he's gonna humiliate me?
1772481 1773914 Mmm-hmm.
1774801 1776951 Well, let's not play by his rules.
1778361 1780017 "My bloodless bite, my bloodless,<br />bloodless bite.
1780041 1781997 "Bloodless bite, bloodless bite,<br />bloodless bite."
1782161 1784391 Can you stop chanting "bloodless bite"?<br />It's just...
1784961 1786952 - Trying to think.<br />- Yeah.
1787481 1789995 Oh, shit!
1790521 1792671 Max and Annie must have figured it out.
1792841 1795036 Right. We need to find an advantage.
1795401 1798837 Advantage, advantage, advantage...
1799121 1800121 Brooks' wallet?
1800281 1802431 You think we should steal<br />all of his shit!
1803001 1804001 No.
1808481 1810472 Hi, yeah. I lost my credit card.
1810561 1812497 I was wondering if you could tell me<br />what the last few charges I made were.
1812521 1813590 What are you doing?
1813761 1815497 If we can find out the name<br />of the murder mystery place he used,
1815521 1817737 we can go to their office and<br />pay them off to give us the final clue.
1817761 1819160 Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
1819321 1823439 You're, like, a double threat.<br />Brains and you're British.
1824441 1825590 Thanks.
1825801 1831194 Okay. What has shiny fangs<br />that bites white things together?
1831361 1832361 A stapler!
1832521 1834512 And the white things are paper.
1834681 1837593 Yes! You are so smart and unfaithful!
1837841 1838876 Oh, there it is.
1839041 1840156 Yes!
1841281 1842999 Look at that.
1843161 1844958 - Flash drive.<br />- Put it in the desktop.
1847281 1848281 Okay.
1849121 1850190 Another riddle.
1850361 1853558 "I'm brown and old by day,<br />white and young by night.
1853721 1854721 "My eyes are glass.
1854881 1856758 "I have nine faces but no head.
1856921 1858639 "I sing to the sky but have no voice.
1858801 1861395 "I'm everywhere and nowhere."
1863121 1864998 What the fuck is that?
1866361 1867680 I mean, how cool are we?
1867881 1869337 - Very, very cool. We are very cool.<br />- Right?
1869361 1872717 You're the cool one. You know,<br />tracking the phone is just a great idea.
1872881 1874155 Still on Route 18, huh?
1874321 1876481 We're catching up to them.<br />Here we come, Brooksie.
1876521 1879194 Can you imagine the look on his face<br />when we find him so fast?
1879361 1882751 You know, baby, I can feel my sperm<br />already coming back to life.
1882921 1884070 - Perfect.<br />- Yeah.
1884241 1887392 So we'll win your brother's car,<br />and then we'll go make a baby in it.
1887561 1889472 - Yeah! We'll make him watch us. Huh?<br />- Yeah.
1890441 1892352 - I don't wanna do that.<br />- No, me neither.
1892521 1893897 - Sorry, don't know why I said that.<br />- I'm not into that.
1893921 1895479 - Not a great idea.<br />- Okay.
1895641 1896869 Okay, great. Thank you.
1897081 1898457 All right, I got the name<br />and the address of the games company.
1898481 1899675 - Let's go.<br />- Yes!
1899841 1902753 All we have to do now,<br />figure out what "bloodless bite" means.
1903321 1904549 No, we don't. That's why...
1906041 1908475 - Oh, yeah, no. Yeah, no.<br />- Doesn't matter. Let's go.
1908641 1910199 How you gonna be old and young?
1910361 1912113 - That doesn't make sense.<br />- I know.
1912281 1914795 Guys, hey, how's it goin'?
1914961 1918078 I just wanted to wish you<br />the best of luck tonight. Bye.
1921041 1922235 - No.<br />- Mmm-mmm.
1922441 1923760 What are... What are you doing?
1923921 1925354 Just being a dick.
1925481 1927711 Oh!
1927801 1929897 - Don't kick him, Ryan!<br />- He's such a good actor!
1929921 1930956 Ryan!
1931041 1933430 God damn it!
1934561 1937001 Baby, hand me those matches.<br />I'm about to burn this door down.
1937161 1939697 You're gonna light a fire in<br />a windowless room that we're trapped in?
1939721 1942337 You slept with Bill Nye the Science Guy.<br />He talked to you about flames?
1942361 1943430 What about that?
1957841 1959638 Where could he be?
1960041 1962509 His phone stopped right here, huh?
1964961 1966189 - Hear that?<br />- Yeah.
1968081 1969150 Ugh.
1969401 1970470 Found it!
1970641 1972161 He must've known we were tracking him.
1972281 1973794 Well, they outsmarted us.
1975801 1976801 Hang on.
1978721 1980359 Isn't that one of the actors?
1980761 1982831 Guess they're not<br />so smart after all, huh?
1983041 1985919 Guess not. We are nailing this!
1987121 1988297 Why are we crouching?
1988321 1990516 I don't know. It feels right.
1994281 1995953 Oh, it's horrible in here.
1996121 1998840 - Yeah, it's sticky. Shoes are shot.<br />- Ugh.
1999481 2001377 Ooh. There he is. There he is.<br />Don't let him see you. Come on.
2001401 2002720 Sit down right here.
2002881 2005156 Bartender, sir,<br />can I ask you a question?
2005241 2006310 Um...
2006561 2007676 You, um...
2007761 2009956 You didn't happen to see a fellow<br />brought in here,
2010121 2011349 looks a little bit like me,
2011521 2013751 but he's got a little bit<br />of a sharper chin
2013921 2015195 and higher cheekbones?
2015361 2017033 So a better-looking guy?
2017401 2019232 No, well, I wouldn't call it that.
2019481 2020960 I didn't see nothing.
2022441 2024159 - Oh, boy. You hear that?<br />- Huh. Yeah.
2024321 2025697 That double negative?<br />"Didn't see nothing"?
2025721 2027497 - It's a little forced, right?<br />- Yeah, I think he's in on it.
2027521 2028937 - 'Course he is.<br />- Look at those tats.
2028961 2030679 So fresh, probably fake.
2031241 2033436 Tell you what.<br />Let's give him a test, okay?
2033601 2036377 Let's order a couple of drinks that only<br />a real bartender would know how to make.
2036401 2037436 Oh, smart! Yes.
2037521 2038954 - Sir! Excuse me. Hi.<br />- Barkeep.
2039121 2040561 Totally forgot to order drinks.
2040681 2041796 Yes, uh...
2042401 2045199 Could I please have a vodka tonic?
2047001 2048036 Well done, honey.
2048201 2050476 I'm gonna have a Harvey Wallbanger.
2050641 2052597 Okay? Appreciate it.
2053201 2054759 Jesus! Did you see that look?
2054921 2056097 Guy doesn't know what's going on.
2056121 2057190 Think you stumped him.
2057361 2059238 Regional theater hack.
2059321 2060720 Huh?
2061201 2063635 - Well, this is kind of fun, isn't it?<br />- Yeah.
2063801 2064977 It's nice to get out of the house.
2065001 2067841 You know, we're not gonna be able<br />to do stuff like this if we have kids.
2067881 2068950 - What?<br />- Yeah.
2069041 2070281 - Why not?<br />- Well, I don't know.
2070401 2072017 I was thinking about it.<br />Remember Dan and Linda?
2072041 2074001 Remember how much time<br />we used to spend with them?
2074161 2076959 Just tons of fun.<br />And then they had those twins.
2077121 2078474 Boom! Off the grid, right?
2078681 2080751 Last time we saw them<br />was their Christmas card
2080841 2081881 with the wonky kids on it.
2082001 2084799 Yeah, I love those Christmas cards.<br />They look so happy.
2084881 2086075 But you know what I mean.
2087121 2089001 - We don't see them...<br />- Vodka tonic.
2089241 2090720 Harvey Wallbanger.
2090881 2092001 - Appreciate it.<br />- Thank you.
2092161 2093640 Cheers.
2096521 2097590 Did he get it right?
2097921 2100137 Huh. I do not know. I realized I've<br />never had one of these,
2100161 2102391 but that is a tasty drink.<br />It's kind of tart.
2102561 2104392 You wanna try it? Oh! Honey!
2104561 2105755 Honey! There's Brooks!
2105921 2108389 Brooks is here. Brooks is here.<br />We're about to win this thing!
2108561 2110711 - Yes, yes!<br />- Look who came in here.
2110921 2113230 Oh! No! I think he made us.
2113401 2115137 So what? It's over.<br />What, are they gonna try to stop us?
2115161 2116480 - Let's go.<br />- Yeah, probably.
2116641 2119519 But that's why I brought this.
2119721 2121337 Jesus Christ, honey!<br />Where did you get a gun?
2121361 2123591 No, no, that's the fake gun<br />from Brooks' fight.
2123761 2126116 - Oh, yeah. Boy, that looks real.<br />- Yeah, well, you know...
2126201 2127737 - Brooks never spares any expense.<br />- Look at that.
2127761 2130150 - Yeah, that's true.<br />- Okay. Follow my lead, huh?
2130321 2131356 Why? What are you doing?
2131481 2132481 Lead?
2132561 2134677 Any of you fucking pricks move,
2134841 2138436 and I'll execute every motherfucking<br />last one of you!
2138521 2139636 Very nice, honey.
2139721 2141552 Pulp Fiction, anybody?<br />Right? It's a classic.
2141641 2142869 We love films.
2142961 2144758 Okay, what the fuck is this shit?
2144841 2147017 Well, you're gonna hand over the keys<br />'cause we're gonna take my brother.
2147041 2148076 Bullshit.
2148161 2151312 Oh! You know what's bullshit<br />is your bald, ugly face.
2151401 2153897 Uh-uh. No, that's personal.<br />Come on, honey, let's just keep it fun.
2153921 2156196 All right, I'm sorry I called you bald,<br />you little bitch!
2156281 2157839 Well, that's, again, you know...
2157921 2160151 - Let the gun do the talking. Come on.<br />- Okay. Ah!
2160281 2161999 On your knees. Hands in the air.
2162161 2163777 - Good. Good. Great.<br />- Heads on the ground. Eyes closed.
2163801 2165281 That's it. Get them up, reach for it.
2165361 2167097 - Hands up! That's right.<br />- There we go.
2167121 2168881 - All right, hands in the air!<br />- Get them up!
2169041 2170394 - Yep.<br />- Yo, where's my head go?
2170601 2171829 - Down.<br />- On the floor.
2172001 2173116 Just rest it.
2173201 2174497 How am I supposed<br />to put my hands in the air
2174521 2175857 - with my head on the ground?<br />- Fucking exactly.
2175881 2177519 I did have the same question.
2178881 2181441 Child's pose?<br />Do you guys know child's pose?
2181601 2182721 Fuck is a child's pose, man?
2182801 2183857 You've never done yoga?
2183881 2184921 - Okay, wow.<br />- No?
2186321 2187481 - Cover me.<br />- Show them, baby.
2187561 2189377 - All right. Arms out.<br />- Here she comes.
2189401 2191119 Knees apart if you have back problems.
2191201 2192361 And if you're doing it right,
2192441 2195353 you're really gonna feel that<br />lumbar opening up back there.
2195441 2196537 Let's put your head down.
2196561 2199439 Come on. I don't wanna have to use this.<br />Okay?
2199681 2201114 Okay.
2201721 2203154 Can't you just tell me who it was?
2203241 2206278 I know you, Kev. If I tell you,<br />you'll just obsess about it even more.
2206361 2207874 Okay, fine. How about this?
2207961 2209872 If I guess it right, you tell me.
2209961 2211030 Fine.
2211121 2212121 Was it an actor?
2212281 2213430 Yes. That tower is unstable.
2213601 2215637 I'm not stable! Was he over 40?
2215801 2216801 Yes. Be careful.
2216961 2219077 Okay. American?
2219241 2220356 Yes.
2222281 2223999 It's Tommy Lee Jones.
2224481 2225880 What? Ew. No.
2227561 2230121 Denzel? Was it Denzel?<br />Denzel Washington?
2230281 2232476 It wasn't, unfortunately.
2232641 2233835 Thank God.
2235321 2236595 Um... Be careful.
2236761 2238399 Oh! Sweet freedom.
2238481 2240119 Oh, my God!
2240201 2242561 You see, this dumbass thought<br />he can keep us locked in here.
2242681 2245479 But guess what?<br />You can't lock us in here!
2245681 2247717 You see, hate put us in here!
2247881 2250190 - Okay, baby.<br />- But love is gonna bust us out!
2250361 2251794 - Ahh!<br />- Oh, my God!
2254081 2255116 Oh, my God!
2255281 2256714 Kev! Kev, are you okay?
2256881 2258473 Baby, I fell down.
2266881 2268280 There it is.
2268921 2272436 Yes, I'm so glad I invited you tonight!
2272521 2273670 Yeah, me, too.
2273841 2277072 I usually bring these girls<br />I wanna sleep with, and they just suck!
2277241 2279675 You're like a breath of fresh air.
2279761 2281274 Aw, thanks.
2281441 2283801 I usually go out with men<br />I find interesting and non-stupid,
2283881 2285394 so this is a bit new for me, too.
2285481 2286675 Whoa!
2286921 2287921 Are we cool?
2288121 2289634 Did I say something wrong?
2289801 2290801 No.
2290881 2293395 No, I mean I was wondering why you<br />asked me along tonight,
2293601 2295910 and now I know you<br />just needed a ringer, so...
2296281 2298954 Oh, did you... You thought<br />this was a date? I didn't...
2299161 2302392 No, actually.<br />Well, I was hoping it wasn't.
2302841 2304559 Then why are you wearing lipstick?
2304721 2305915 - I'm not.<br />- Yeah, you are.
2306081 2307275 What are you...
2307441 2308760 You can't touch a girl's mouth.
2308921 2310737 Why? Are you scared I'm<br />gonna smear your lipstick...
2310761 2312433 Oh, my God! You bit me!
2312601 2313697 Yeah, and I'll bite you again.
2313721 2314756 There's lipstick on here.
2314921 2316434 Oh, shut up!
2316601 2318478 I see you wiping off that date lipstick!
2320441 2321590 Ow!
2321681 2323717 That really hurt a little bit.
2325001 2326320 Hello?
2326561 2328119 Hello?
2335721 2336949 Um, excuse me?
2341881 2343394 Yeah, okay.
2344201 2345270 Um...
2345361 2346361 Hello?
2350201 2352192 Oh, oh! Oh, shit!
2354881 2355950 Holy shit!
2356881 2357996 God!
2358441 2359961 Come on! Bloody hell!
2360121 2361270 - What?<br />- Phew!
2361601 2364559 You guys scared me so bad.<br />What are you doing?
2364721 2365949 What the fuck is that?
2366761 2368479 Oh. Well, I just came from
2368561 2370577 a six-hour murder mystery<br />where I played the corpse.
2370601 2373161 I must've dozed off<br />before I had a chance to clean up.
2373241 2375391 Well, you scared the shit out of us.
2375481 2376596 Really? Thank you.
2376681 2378721 Actually that means a lot<br />'cause I do my own makeup.
2378841 2381196 What kind of party<br />has a pregnant corpse?
2381361 2384478 No, I'm actually pregnant.<br />This isn't part of it. This is just...
2384561 2385596 Oh!
2385681 2386750 - Congrats.<br />- Thank you!
2388321 2390710 Um, we want you<br />to give us the final clue
2390801 2393838 to the murder mystery<br />Brooks Davis ordered.
2393921 2395832 Oh, my gosh.<br />But that would ruin the fun.
2395921 2398594 We don't want the fun.<br />We just wanna win.
2398681 2400353 Yeah, I can't do that.
2411881 2413917 This change your mind?
2418801 2419950 No.
2421361 2422714 Don't...
2423121 2425271 What about this?
2433441 2434715 Mmm.
2435801 2437234 You drive a hard bargain. Okay.
2437401 2439710 Let's take it up a notch.
2453001 2456676 I was hoping I wasn't<br />gonna have to dig this deep, but okay.
2456841 2458911 Final offer.
2465681 2469117 You know what? It doesn't matter<br />how slowly you slide it over!
2469321 2471551 Okay? It's $17! How much do you want?
2472401 2474596 - Um, I don't know. Probably $100.<br />- Give her $100.
2475001 2476514 I don't have a hundred.
2477401 2479357 How much have you got?
2480001 2481116 $17.
2481361 2483158 $17?
2484281 2485794 You brought $17 out?
2488321 2490152 Nice!
2490521 2491636 - Thank you!<br />- Cool.
2492121 2494077 So you're just gonna keep it. I got you.
2494801 2496314 Stay back!
2496401 2498417 Hey, buddy, can you just give us<br />the answer to the second riddle,
2498441 2499669 'cause we're way behind.
2499761 2501080 Don't you get it?
2501161 2502833 That was not supposed to happen.
2504921 2507230 Oh, what now? You guys already<br />did the breaking-in thing.
2507321 2509755 Shut up! And get on the floor,<br />all of you!
2510041 2511110 Whoa!
2511201 2513192 Ron, you okay?
2513321 2515232 No, Nathan, I'm not okay.
2515321 2517960 Two guys came in here and attacked me.
2518041 2519679 - Oh, my God.<br />- I know!
2519761 2522798 And I quit Disney Cruises<br />for this bullshit.
2525081 2526657 We can check,<br />but that doesn't make any sense.
2526681 2527909 I'm not wearing a jacket.
2528081 2530470 Maybe it means, like a book jacket.
2530641 2533075 Why would a book have a jacket?
2534961 2535961 Murder We Wrote.
2536081 2537497 Glenda, something terrible has happened.
2537521 2538521 What?
2538641 2540057 Nathan and I<br />showed up for the takeaway,
2540081 2541799 and Ron had been attacked.
2541961 2543281 Where? At the Brooks Davis house?
2543361 2544481 - Yes.<br />- Huh?
2544521 2545521 What?
2546641 2548120 Is everyone okay?
2548281 2549999 No, no. I'm not okay, Glenda!
2550161 2553517 I have a throbbing headache,<br />and they took the host!
2553681 2555353 - Who took him?<br />- Kidnappers!
2555521 2558115 Real ones! Dangerous fucking criminals!
2568601 2571601 I'm packed and I'm holding<br />I'm smiling, she's living, she's golden
2571681 2572830 She lives for me
2573001 2574275 - Sing into the mic.<br />- Jesus!
2574361 2575396 No.
2575481 2579076 Her own motivation<br />She goes round, and she goes down on me
2579241 2580276 And you, Tats?
2580441 2583194 You got something to say? No? Boop.
2583361 2585591 Coming over you<br />Keep on smiling, what we go through
2586041 2588680 One stop to the rhythm that divides you
2588841 2591958 I see you eyeing that, Ponytail.<br />Not on my watch!
2592041 2593918 Bingo! Bingo! I got them, baby.<br />Let's do this.
2594081 2596436 Yes! Okay.
2597881 2599394 Hey, hey, Brooks!
2599561 2601677 - Guess who it is!<br />- Oh!
2601841 2604674 Ready? Hello!
2604961 2606297 - Look at that face!<br />- Oh, shit.
2606321 2607356 That is priceless!
2607441 2609017 You did not expect us this early,<br />did you?
2609041 2611271 I've gotta capture this moment.<br />Honey, get in there.
2611441 2613272 We'll take a quick little selfie here
2613441 2615830 and send it off to the losers.<br />One, two, three.
2616001 2617275 Cheese!
2617361 2618555 Ha!
2618641 2619737 Perfect. Oh, speak of the devil.
2619761 2621877 There's Ryan now,<br />probably calling begging for help.
2621961 2622961 - Ugh!<br />- Ignore.
2623041 2624599 This is not a game, Max!
2625281 2628193 Jesus! Guys, it's a wrap in here, okay?
2628601 2629601 Show's over!
2629681 2631657 Listen, I'm not a venture capitalist.<br />I'm a smuggler!
2631681 2634479 - A smuggler?<br />- Yeah, I made a mistake.
2634561 2635777 I sold the Bulgarian's egg<br />to a different guy.
2635801 2637577 And I have to get it back to him,<br />or he's gonna kill me!
2637601 2640441 "The Bulgarian's egg"? Wasn't that<br />the third Harry Potter book? Come on.
2640561 2643041 Wait, I'm confused. So, this isn't<br />the end of this whole thing?
2643161 2644276 No, it is the end, okay?
2644441 2646159 You said, whoever catches you<br />gets the car.
2646321 2648471 We found you, we get the car. Game over.
2648641 2650757 No! I'm telling you! This is all real!
2651121 2652617 The shitty actors are real?<br />Come on.
2652641 2654481 How about that ridiculous fight?<br />Was that real?
2654601 2656000 Is this gun real?
2656081 2657081 Oh, no, Annie!
2657161 2659436 Oh, no. Oh, no. Bang, bang.
2661601 2662601 Ow!
2670961 2671996 Blood!
2672161 2674755 Oh, my God! I shot you!
2674921 2676400 You fucking shot me!
2676561 2678153 Cut me loose before we all get shot!
2678361 2679361 Come on, untie me!
2679681 2680921 - Get me out of here!<br />- Oh, God!
2682361 2683635 Help me. Help.
2683801 2684950 Oh, my God!
2685161 2687337 - Go out! Go, go, go!<br />- What the fuck did you do to me?
2687361 2689033 Come on, come on, come on.
2689481 2691153 - Hey!<br />- Where are the guns?
2693721 2694756 You shot me.
2694961 2696474 I know. I feel terrible.
2696641 2697977 - Come on, man!<br />- Go! Go, go!
2698001 2699097 Whoa, whoa, whoa!
2699121 2700177 Come on, come on, come on!
2700201 2701577 Oh, my God!<br />Move your ass!
2701601 2704801 Honey, get in!<br />Go, go, go!
2706121 2707679 Holy shit!
2708921 2711754 Hold up! Hold up, motherfucker!
2713121 2715237 - God damn it!<br />- Man, come on!
2717281 2719377 Brooks, what the fuck<br />is going on with you? Start talking!
2719401 2721835 I've lied to you<br />and the family about what I do.
2721921 2724879 I buy and I sell illegal shit for people<br />in the black market.
2724961 2726235 Really? So you're a criminal?
2726321 2727641 Oh, my God! They're following us!
2729321 2730657 But I made a mistake,<br />because there's this guy.
2730681 2731737 They call him the Bulgarian.
2731761 2734070 He's got his fingers in all these pies<br />around the world.
2734241 2736232 - What kind of pies?<br />- Illegal pies, Max.
2736321 2739137 You know, the kind of pies that have<br />heroin in them and guns and sex slaves.
2739161 2740217 You know, all that kind of stuff.
2740241 2742994 But he just wanted me to help him<br />find this Fabergé egg.
2743081 2745436 Fuck that! Fabergé egg?
2745521 2747057 - Are you kidding me?<br />- No, I'm serious.
2747081 2748081 And I found it!
2748161 2750800 But then there was this other guy,<br />this Marlon Freeman.
2750881 2752951 He's willing to pay twice as much<br />for the same egg.
2753041 2754577 So what? So you screwed over<br />the Bulgarian guy
2754601 2755937 and those fellows behind us<br />work for him,
2755961 2757777 and they just happen to crash your<br />murder mystery party?
2757801 2760076 I know, right?<br />What are the odds of that?
2761561 2763401 - Oh, too close, too close!<br />- Careful, careful!
2765041 2766269 Watch out! Watch out!
2766361 2767361 Oh, oh!
2770041 2771269 - Shit!<br />- Sorry! You okay?
2771441 2772476 Yeah, I'm all right.
2772561 2774995 - We need to go to the cops now!<br />- Yeah, right now! Let's go!
2775161 2776377 - We can't go to the cops!<br />- Why?
2776401 2777801 The Bulgarian's got a ton of moles.
2777841 2778956 On his face?
2780641 2781960 No, in the police department.
2782121 2783440 Look out!
2784841 2786194 Careful!
2790801 2792200 Oh, my God! This is insane!
2806641 2808916 If you call the cops,<br />I'll be dead before I get to jail.
2809081 2810657 Why don't we just get a hold<br />of this Marlon Freeman guy
2810681 2811817 and buy the egg back from him?
2811841 2814081 I couldn't find him if I wanted to.<br />That name's an alias.
2817961 2819553 - Gun, gun, gun! Duck!<br />- Oh, oh...
2829601 2831671 Okay, these guys are not stopping.<br />What do we do?
2831841 2834913 They're not gonna stop<br />until they get me.
2835081 2836992 I'm sorry I dragged you guys into this.
2837081 2838081 Oh, my God!
2838241 2840471 I'm sorry for a lot of things.
2842801 2845321 - Hey! What are you doing?<br />- What is he doing? What is he doing?
2845761 2847752 - I love you, Max!<br />- Brooks, don't be an idiot!
2850321 2851321 Stop the car!
2860081 2862515 - Shit! Go, go, go!<br />- Oh, my God! Okay, okay.
2866001 2868282 Fuck! What are we gonna do?<br />They're gonna kill my brother.
2868321 2870041 Oh, Annie, I feel faint.<br />I'm gonna pass out.
2870081 2871878 Oh, honey, we'll get you<br />to a hospital, okay?
2872041 2873315 No, no, no! No hospitals.
2873481 2874817 This is a gunshot wound,<br />they'll call the cops.
2874841 2875841 Shit, shit! Okay.
2875921 2878435 So we go to a mob doctor, right?
2879521 2880977 Do you know one of those, sweetheart?
2881001 2882719 - No.<br />- No.
2882881 2884801 What about a veterinarian<br />that works for the mob?
2885121 2886839 - You know one of those?<br />- No.
2887001 2888577 Come on. Why are you pitching<br />all the mob stuff?
2888601 2890717 - I think 'cause I'm losing my shit here!<br />- I get it.
2890881 2891961 You're gonna have to do it.
2892001 2893001 - What?<br />- Yup.
2893081 2894337 You're gonna have<br />to take the bullet out.
2894361 2895617 I don't wanna... I don't wanna do it.
2895641 2896857 You think I want you<br />to take the bullet out?
2896881 2899241 I've seen you try to cut a chicken.<br />We have no other option.
2899321 2901710 Oh, my God! This is so bad!
2901881 2903439 I hate game night!
2907041 2908401 Thank you!
2909961 2910961 Hey!
2911041 2912761 Oh, thank God.<br />Listen, Annie. It's all real.
2912801 2913801 Oh, no, I know.
2913881 2915473 Brooks is caught up in something and...
2915681 2917034 Okay, where are you guys?
2917121 2918777 We're all at Brooks'.<br />Waiting to talk to the cops.
2918801 2921031 No! No, no, no! Do not talk to the cops!
2921201 2922281 What? Why? What's going on?
2922441 2923761 - Are you guys okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2923841 2925991 We're fine. We're fine.<br />I shot Max, but he's fine.
2926081 2927081 What?
2927161 2928577 Look. We will meet you<br />back at our house.
2928601 2930441 Whatever you do,<br />do not tell the cops anything.
2930521 2932796 Brooks's life depends on it.
2937481 2938880 - Hey.<br />- Hi.
2939081 2940196 Okay.
2940361 2941396 I got a bunch of stuff.
2941481 2942481 Yeah.
2943041 2945236 Pocket knife. Tweezers.
2945321 2946754 Sewing kit. Gauze.
2946881 2948457 Good, good. All right.<br />Wow, you did great!
2948481 2950915 Yeah.<br />And they didn't have rubbing alcohol.
2951081 2953879 And they don't sell hard liquor,<br />so I got you this lovely chard.
2954041 2956157 Good idea. Way to pivot, yep. Good girl.
2956321 2958198 What else did you get, huh?<br />More good stuff?
2958761 2960991 What is helpful in Country Living?
2961161 2964915 Oh, that's for later. There's a corn<br />chowder recipe. It looks really good.
2965081 2967041 - You love corn chowder, huh?<br />- Sweet. I do, yeah.
2967081 2968217 - That'll cheer you up.<br />- Thank you.
2968241 2969720 Okay. And then a squeaky toy.
2970241 2971276 - Huh.<br />- For your mouth.
2971441 2972441 - For the pain.<br />- Mmm-hmm.
2972601 2974201 Okay. Well, hopefully I won't need this.
2974281 2976078 - Okay, let's see this bad boy.<br />- All right.
2976281 2977350 Yeah, careful.
2977521 2979159 - Okay.<br />- All right.
2980401 2981401 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
2981561 2982697 - We're gonna push past it.<br />- No problem. No problem.
2982721 2983977 - We're gonna get the bullet out.<br />- Let's just Google.
2984001 2985417 Honey, can you return the text later?
2985441 2987281 This is instructions<br />on how to remove a bullet.
2988121 2989817 - Oh, sorry.<br />- It's an alt-right militia website,
2989841 2991481 so I'm just gonna<br />ignore the racist stuff.
2991601 2992670 - Good. Good, good.<br />- Yeah?
2992881 2994314 Okay. "Step one, sterile gloves."
2994761 2995989 Check!
2996161 2997337 We're doing the best we can, right?
2997361 2999079 Okay. Yeah. We're getting by.
2999241 3000754 "Step two."
3000841 3003435 Um... Okay. "Disinfect wound."
3003641 3005597 Right, yeah.<br />That's gonna sting, isn't it?
3005681 3007080 Yeah, a little bit. Yeah.
3007161 3008480 - Let's do it.<br />- Okay?
3010361 3012556 That smarts, huh?
3012721 3014473 Yeah.
3014641 3016597 Gonna administer anesthetic.
3016761 3018897 - We don't have that.<br />- Just gonna skip that one. Okay.
3018921 3020641 "Step four,<br />apply pressure above the wound."
3020681 3022592 Here, you squeeze that there.
3022681 3023777 - I got it.<br />- Great. Thank you.
3023801 3026361 We're just gonna<br />make two tiny incisions...
3026441 3028017 - Oh, my God.<br />- On either side of the wound.
3028041 3030236 Easy-peasy. Huh?
3030521 3031715 This is fun, huh?
3031841 3033672 - Are you having fun?<br />- No.
3033801 3034870 Let's get the bullet.
3034961 3036377 - Okay. Here we go.<br />- Let's get in there and get it.
3036401 3038577 - Nice and small, nice and small, baby.<br />- Okay. Yeah, yeah.
3038601 3039670 Tiny, teeny.
3043441 3045750 That's not small. That's really big!
3045921 3046956 So big?
3047041 3049157 Way too big, baby.<br />It's a bullet, not a grapefruit.
3049241 3051457 I'm sorry! I'm sorry.<br />This is my first time. I don't know...
3051481 3052960 Oh, there's so much blood.
3054321 3057472 - No, no. Don't you start doing that.<br />- No, you're gonna make...
3060961 3061996 - I'm sorry.<br />- Stop it.
3062121 3063537 I'm looking at you,<br />and you're making me...
3063561 3065017 Well, don't look at me.<br />I won't look at it.
3065041 3066817 - Push through. Let's go.<br />- Okay. All right, okay.
3066841 3067937 - No more cutting.<br />- Oh, shit.
3067961 3069097 Just get the tweezers<br />and get the bullet out, baby.
3069121 3070349 Shit, shit, shit. Um...
3070441 3072557 - What? What happened?<br />- Phone went to sleep.
3072641 3073937 You gotta set it so that thing stays on.
3073961 3075177 - No. My phone doesn't do that.<br />- Sure it does.
3075201 3076577 Same phone as mine. Just change it.
3076601 3078937 Just gonna touch it with my nose<br />every 30 seconds. It's fine.
3078961 3080417 Don't be afraid of your phone.<br />Get in there, go to the settings,
3080441 3083177 go to "Display" and change the timing<br />so that it doesn't revert to sleep mode.
3083201 3084236 - Revert?<br />- Yeah.
3084321 3085977 What are you, Steve Jobs?<br />I'm not reverting anything. No.
3086001 3087097 No, I'm just<br />unafraid of my phone, honey.
3087121 3088121 It's so fucking simple.
3088601 3090319 Shh! Quiet. I know what I'm doing, okay?
3090521 3091715 Do you?
3091801 3092801 Yes.
3093001 3094753 - Here we go. Here we go.<br />- Here she goes.
3094921 3096400 You're like a dolphin.
3096561 3098279 All right. This part's gonna hurt.
3098441 3099590 I don't... I don't doubt it.
3099761 3101160 Okay, let's do this.
3101601 3102601 Okay.
3103761 3104955 Ooh... Oh, wait.
3105521 3106841 What is that?
3106881 3107881 You hear that?
3108001 3109514 What's that sound? What's that sound?
3109601 3110829 Is that the bullet?
3111001 3113276 - That's bone!<br />- What?
3113361 3114919 That's not right.
3115361 3119195 Okay. Um, what do the racists say<br />if you can't find the bullet?
3119281 3120697 Yeah, that's bone. You got the bone.
3120721 3122712 I'm looking at my bone. Look right here.
3122881 3125953 Max, did you get shot twice?
3129161 3130276 That's the exit wound.
3130801 3132314 Oh, it came out!
3132441 3133920 Yup. Nothing to remove.
3134081 3135281 The bullet has exited the arm.
3135401 3136657 Well, let's just sew<br />that sucker up, huh?
3136681 3137681 Yeah.
3139961 3142600 No, no. Honey, don't, don't look at...
3142681 3143716 Stop it.
3146121 3147190 I'm sorry.
3147521 3150137 Now, the Bulgarian's guys have Brooks,<br />and the only way to save him
3150161 3152391 is to get that egg<br />from this Marlon Freeman guy.
3152481 3155075 I can't believe your brother's been<br />lying to us this whole time.
3155161 3156879 He's even cooler than we thought.
3156961 3159350 Honey, I think you sewed my arm<br />to my sleeve.
3159441 3161617 I didn't even know<br />Morgan Freeman collected Fabergé eggs.
3161641 3163438 Aren't those worth millions of dollars?
3163521 3165477 It's Marlon Freeman,<br />but that's just an alias.
3165561 3167697 Somehow, we gotta find out<br />his real name, find out his address.
3167721 3169871 - Police computer.<br />- What do you mean?
3169961 3172031 I once dated this girl<br />whose father was a cop.
3172121 3174077 She showed me her dad's police computer.
3174161 3176959 It has a database with<br />every known alias on it.
3177041 3179680 I bet we could find Marlon Wayans'<br />real name on it.
3179761 3182377 So, if we called her up, would she<br />let you go on her dad's computer?
3182401 3184710 No. No. No way! That ended badly.
3185001 3187841 So how are we gonna get into a police<br />computer without the cops knowing?
3187881 3189257 - Billy Bob Thornton!<br />- What?
3189281 3191317 - What?<br />- You slept with Billy Bob, didn't you?
3191401 3195758 Hang on. Hang on. I know<br />where we can get on a police computer.
3196881 3199111 - Hey!<br />- Gary!
3199481 3200800 Goodness.
3201481 3203437 To what do<br />Bastian and I owe the pleasure?
3203601 3205000 Well, we were all just talking,
3205161 3207914 and we realized<br />we haven't had a game night in ages,
3208081 3209639 just the seven of us.
3209721 3210721 So...
3210801 3212757 I thought you were going<br />to your brother's house.
3212841 3213990 I never said that.
3214081 3216197 Come on, Gare Bear.<br />Live a little! It's the weekend!
3216281 3219398 We were just saying how you were always<br />better at games than Debbie was.
3219481 3221676 I'll thank you<br />not to besmirch my ex-wife.
3222121 3223600 That woman is an angel.
3223681 3227913 Oh. Yeah, she was much better at games<br />than you.
3228481 3234477 I will admit I have eagerly awaited<br />a visit such as this.
3240561 3241835 Where'd he go?
3242481 3243994 Do we follow him?
3244081 3245275 It seems like it.
3245361 3246999 - Ryan, you go first.<br />- I'm scared.
3253761 3256229 Help yourself to popped corn<br />with sea salt.
3256321 3258152 Oh! Oh!
3259041 3260520 Yummy, yummy.
3261041 3263635 I can't believe that you read my mind.<br />I was craving popcorn.
3263801 3266110 You have a framed photo of game night?
3266321 3270109 Doesn't everyone have photographs<br />of their best friends in their homes?
3271606 3273961 Of course. We do.
3274566 3276318 Max, uh, you wanna go first?
3276406 3278283 Okay, I'll start. I'll do it.
3278926 3280120 Oh. There's a loose one.
3280206 3282595 Always in the middle.<br />That's where you wanna go.
3282686 3284085 Can I use your john real quick?
3284166 3286555 Of course.<br />It's the end of the hall, next to our...
3290126 3291844 My bedroom.
3293326 3294361 Okay.
3316886 3318558 Oh, no, Gary.
3346206 3349721 So, Sarah, how long have you two<br />been a couple?
3350566 3353034 Oh, no! No, we're not. We just...
3353166 3356283 We work together. I wouldn't, um...<br />I wouldn't do that thing.
3356366 3361838 I see. I thought I detected a certain<br />chemistry between the two of you.
3361966 3364526 No. No way.
3365166 3367316 - No, that's not...<br />- Mmm. Mmm.
3367646 3371275 Then again, I'm not the best judge<br />of chemistry in the world.
3379246 3380395 Hmm.
3381006 3382678 Oh, because your wife left you.
3383246 3384474 Oh, shit.
3394206 3396356 Hello, Donald Anderton.
3405406 3407362 Oh!
3408046 3412562 So many possible moves.<br />I just don't know where to begin.
3414566 3416124 Um, maybe... Ooh...
3417446 3419062 - Decision-making.<br />- Come on, Annie. Just make up your mind.
3419086 3420644 - No!<br />- Please! No?
3422886 3425798 Yup, take your time.
3457886 3460684 Oh, Brooks. What have you<br />gotten yourself into?
3477966 3482039 Oh, shit. Where did you<br />come from, little guy?
3483406 3487285 Son of a bitch.<br />Hey! What are you, a vampire?
3487526 3490165 Oh, God. Oh, God.
3493046 3496402 Oh, my God. Has that got it?
3496566 3500445 No, that doesn't got it.<br />God damn it. Come on!
3504966 3505966 No!
3507846 3508846 I should go check on him.
3508926 3510326 I think he's fine.
3510566 3513558 - He cried out.<br />- Tell me about Debbie.
3516406 3517634 I beg your pardon.
3518366 3522837 Oh, just I... I never met her.<br />I'd love to hear all about her.
3533806 3535239 Where do I begin?
3535406 3538000 All right, you wanna take a bath?<br />We'll take a little bath.
3538166 3542956 There we go. Okay.<br />All right. Here we go.
3545206 3548039 There we go, huh? Huh?
3549526 3550720 Oh, it's so much worse.
3551406 3554842 Oh, God. And what did I do to this?<br />What the fuck is this thing?
3556366 3557481 Oh, Debbie.
3557566 3558760 Oh!
3566326 3568760 Okay. Fuck this.
3569366 3571197 Hey, guys, Gary was right.<br />It's awful late.
3571286 3573595 Let's get home, get to bed, huh?<br />Get out of his hair.
3573686 3575881 We haven't finished the game.<br />It's your turn, Max.
3576046 3577274 Oh, my turn, huh?
3577446 3579960 Okay, be careful now, Max.<br />Oh!
3580046 3581764 Well, game over. I went in a little hot.
3581926 3584838 - Why did you...<br />- Thanks! Good to see you, Gary.
3585006 3587122 When shall we play next?
3587206 3590198 Soon. We'll call you.
3595046 3597924 Bastian. Baby!
3599686 3603725 So, how are we supposed to get this egg<br />out of Donald Anderton's house?
3603806 3605444 I don't know. I'm gonna figure it out.
3606526 3609165 "Unknown Caller." Please don't be Gary.
3609246 3611840 - Hello?<br />- We have your brother.
3612726 3613875 Um...
3613966 3615479 Okay. Uh, we know where the egg is,
3615566 3616782 and we're actually<br />on our way there right now.
3616806 3618542 We can do a swap, okay?<br />Please don't hurt Brooks.
3618566 3622479 Meet us on the East 4th Street bridge<br />at midnight. If you're late, he dies.
3622566 3623999 - Oh, my God.<br />- Um...
3624566 3627126 Boy, that's less than an hour from now.
3628566 3629635 Hello?
3629726 3632877 What's up with this guy's voice?<br />He sounds like a monster.
3633046 3634798 He's using a voice changer, Ryan.
3634886 3637195 He still sounds like a scary monster.
3640526 3644280 And we are here.
3644886 3645942 All right. You guys head home,
3645966 3647302 and I will call as soon<br />as I get the egg, all right?
3647326 3649476 What? Wait a second. Wait.<br />I'm going with you.
3649646 3651702 No, Annie. It could be very, very<br />dangerous in there, okay?
3651726 3654007 Listen, Brooks shouldn't have<br />dragged any of us into this,
3654046 3655782 but he is my brother,<br />and it's up to me to fix it.
3655806 3657876 No, bullshit!<br />We're all in this together!
3657966 3660082 No, no, no. Max is right.<br />You guys should go home,
3660246 3662441 but you and I are doing this.
3662606 3664961 Okay, what happens<br />if you guys don't make it out?
3665046 3667382 We don't come to game night because<br />we're dying to play charades and shit.
3667406 3668726 We come because we love you guys.
3668766 3670882 Honestly, this is<br />the best part of our week.
3670966 3674117 Mine, too. And I have<br />a lot of options on the weekend.
3674206 3676276 Wow. You guys...
3676406 3678397 Thank you. That's very nice.
3679126 3680923 Aw, good friends.
3681606 3684837 You should probably go, though, right?<br />I mean, you don't even know us.
3685246 3686804 Yeah, why are you still here?
3686886 3690242 Oh, I don't know.<br />I just got caught up in it.
3690326 3692317 Also, if I go home now,
3692406 3694222 and then I read in the newspaper<br />tomorrow that you all died,
3694246 3698205 I'll just... I'll feel shit that I left,<br />so I'm gonna stick around.
3698966 3701002 You still read the newspaper?
3701166 3702963 That's what you got from that?
3703046 3705037 How are we gonna get into this place?
3706886 3708922 Go! Go! Go! Go!
3715366 3716845 Okay.
3718406 3721318 Looks like they got a party going on.<br />This could be good.
3733526 3735994 Where is everybody?
3751686 3752914 No way!
3761446 3763562 It's some kind of rich guy's fight club.
3763646 3766479 I knew it. They are real.
3770526 3771595 Come on!
3783006 3786396 That's my Boomer! That's my Boomer!
3787206 3789117 Man, this is some<br />Django Unchained bullshit.
3789206 3790206 Water!
3791126 3794482 That's my boy! Good boy! Good boy!
3794686 3796836 Rich people are fucked up!
3797006 3799156 Kramer, get Logan ready!
3799326 3802159 Okay, minimum buy in is now 10 grand.
3802366 3803719 Okay, I think we should split up.
3803886 3805126 Yeah. And let's start upstairs.
3805166 3807126 Anybody finds the egg,<br />just text the others, okay?
3807166 3809022 And for God's sake, be careful with it.<br />All right?
3809046 3810046 Got you. I got it.
3810166 3811281 Be safe.
3813446 3814806 What are you...<br />What are you doing?
3814886 3816160 Who says the egg isn't in here?
3817166 3819964 Also, I have a really good feeling<br />about Logan.
3820126 3823357 Egg, egg, egg.<br />Wow! This is some bedroom.
3823526 3825182 Does it remind you<br />of your celebrity boyfriend's?
3825206 3826355 Are you still on this?
3826486 3829046 Yes, I'm still on this, Michelle.<br />That's all I can think about.
3829126 3830195 And that's saying a lot,
3830286 3833403 considering we got Eyes Wide Fight Club<br />going on downstairs.
3833606 3835358 Why is this so important to you?
3835566 3839115 Because, Michelle, look,<br />I am losing my mind here. Okay?
3839286 3840685 We were broken up at the time.
3840846 3844156 I got a hand job from Karen Waller,<br />so you had every right to.
3844366 3845640 So why not just tell me?
3847726 3849762 Okay, fine.
3851526 3853005 It was 10 years ago.
3853206 3856915 I was at a gas station,<br />and I noticed a guy at the next pump.
3858766 3862236 It was Denzel Washington.
3862486 3863714 Hold up.
3865246 3867316 It actually was Denzel?
3867406 3868475 Yeah.
3872726 3874398 He was really nice.
3874486 3878274 He made some joke about how premium gas<br />is probably the same as regular.
3878366 3880960 I took a chance, and I asked him<br />if he wanted to get drinks.
3881046 3882274 He said yes.
3882926 3884439 We both got a little tipsy.
3884526 3886278 I offered to pay for drinks,<br />and he let me,
3886406 3887885 which I thought was pretty cool.
3889406 3891715 We danced for hours.
3894446 3896086 Eventually, we ended up<br />back at his place,
3896166 3899078 and one thing led to another.
3901046 3903958 It was just<br />this crazy thing that happened,
3904046 3905718 and, in a weird way, it made me realize
3905806 3909242 the only person<br />I ever wanna be with is you.
3911086 3912086 Nah.
3912566 3914045 Nah. I don't believe it.
3914326 3915964 - Oh, you...<br />- Mmm-mmm.
3916046 3917923 Well, I took a picture with him<br />at the club.
3918086 3919838 I put it in a hidden folder.
3920926 3922041 Denzel and Michelle.
3927843 3929322 Yeah, baby, that's not Denzel.
3929603 3930831 Yeah, it is.
3931003 3932152 Mmm. No, it's not.
3932283 3934638 Dude looks a lot like Denzel,
3935403 3936472 but, uh, it's not him.
3936643 3938838 You're crazy. That's...<br />Look at that, that's Denzel.
3939003 3941043 Okay, let me ask you this.<br />Did he say he was Denzel?
3941123 3942522 Well, no.
3943443 3946082 He tried to introduce himself,<br />and I cut him off
3946163 3948472 because I told him I knew who he was.
3951043 3953113 - What kind of car did he drive?<br />- A BMW.
3953203 3954431 - Hmm.<br />- Three series.
3954523 3957242 Mmm. What was his place like?
3958043 3960398 It... It was a two-bedroom condo.
3962363 3966800 And he used the, um, spare room<br />as an office, so...
3967323 3968923 Do you hear<br />what you're saying right now?
3969083 3970641 Hold on, let me see.
3971643 3973838 When you zoom in,<br />the nose gives it away, right?
3975083 3976402 - God damn!<br />- Mmm-hmm.
3976483 3979475 Look, don't beat yourself up about it,<br />okay? There is some good news.
3979643 3982362 If you wanna get with Denzel, huh,
3982443 3984479 he's standing right here!
3984563 3989353 Because the real Denzel<br />ain't got shit on me.
3992083 3997203 I mean, how does this monster have<br />five kids? We don't get to have one.
3997923 4000118 Well, his wife looks like<br />she's about 15.
4000243 4003553 Uh... Yeah. My sperm are fine.
4003723 4005918 Right, right. No, I know, honey.<br />We're just gonna...
4006083 4009678 We're gonna keep plugging away<br />until something sticks, okay?
4009763 4012516 Gee, you really sound like a guy<br />who wants to have a kid.
4012643 4013723 Well, you know, I'm just...
4013803 4016920 I'm a little distracted right now,<br />honey, as you might imagine.
4017003 4020712 Look, if you're not into this,<br />you kind of gotta tell me.
4021323 4022323 Listen.
4023003 4026154 I wanna have a baby,<br />but how do I explain this? Um...
4027483 4030043 Do you remember how we used to play<br />Pac-Man at Fisker Lanes,
4030123 4031219 and we could play all night?
4031243 4033499 Do you remember, this one time,<br />I made it all the way up to level 86,
4033523 4035899 - and you were not too far behind, right?<br />- Eighty-five, but...
4035923 4037403 And then I kicked your ass at Galaga.
4037443 4039323 - So anyway, what is the point?<br />- Mmm... Anyway,
4039363 4041274 do you remember<br />how we stayed alive so long?
4041363 4043274 All we did was we ate the pellets.
4043363 4046082 We never ate the fruit<br />because the fruit is how they get you.
4047923 4049276 Oh, you're doing a metaphor!
4049363 4050842 Yes, but here's the problem.
4050923 4053391 No matter how long you and I<br />stayed alive in the game,
4053483 4055603 neither one of us ever made it<br />up to the leader board.
4056843 4058754 And you think if we have a baby,
4058843 4060242 we'll be officially settling down,
4060323 4062712 and you'll never make it<br />onto the leader board of life?
4062803 4064395 That's such a good metaphor.
4064483 4066758 Yeah, no, it's not.<br />It's kind of bullshit.
4066843 4067843 Why?
4067923 4069720 - What are we, 16 years old?<br />- No.
4069883 4072556 You wanna go backpacking<br />through Europe? Huh?
4072723 4075556 You wanna, like, have some wine coolers<br />on a football field
4075643 4077315 with Rebecca De Mornay?
4077483 4079155 Not specifically.
4079323 4081883 You know<br />who's always gone for the fruit, Max?
4082043 4086241 Your criminal brother, and that is why<br />the ghosts are about to eat him!
4086403 4088121 Look who's embracing the metaphor.
4088203 4089682 I'm so... I'm... Wow.
4090163 4092836 You know what? All this time,<br />I've just been thinking
4092923 4097041 that if I helped you beat Brooks,<br />you would be less stressed.
4097123 4100593 But you don't wanna beat Brooks.<br />You wanna be Brooks.
4102723 4104520 I'm gonna look somewhere else.
4117243 4119598 Come on, Logan! Boomer ain't shit!
4119683 4121162 Hey, ADHD!
4121243 4122803 We're supposed to be looking for the...
4125363 4128002 Holy shit. I'm right again.
4130123 4131715 Wait, where are you going?
4131803 4133779 Everybody's watching the fight.<br />I'm gonna go grab it.
4133803 4136636 - No, don't fucking...<br />- Be cool. Be cool. Be cool.
4148683 4149683 Kill him!
4151683 4153594 Oh, shit!
4157243 4158243 Who the hell are you?
4159283 4160283 Me?
4160363 4163355 Yeah. Who are you?<br />And what are you doing with my egg?
4164043 4166273 Oh. I was just admiring it.
4166363 4170402 I got a bunch of these fancy-pants eggs<br />back at home. In my mansion.
4170923 4173118 - Uh-huh.<br />- This one's ugly. Hmm.
4174643 4176042 Does anybody know this guy?
4176123 4181800 I certainly hope so.<br />I'm the CEO of Cyberdyne Systems.
4181883 4183441 I should go.
4184323 4185517 Boomer, take him down.
4185603 4187559 Everyone hold on a goddamn second!
4192123 4193272 Boomer!
4198163 4199163 Hey, any luck yet?
4199323 4200438 - No.<br />- You?
4200603 4204562 Go! Go! Go! I got it! I got it!<br />Let's go! Come on!
4214683 4215939 Sorry. Sorry.
4215963 4217157 Hey, Ryan! Ryan!
4217603 4218877 Oh, shit.
4219243 4220562 No!
4220643 4222076 Okay, okay.
4222163 4223516 Shit!
4226723 4230033 Michelle, I'm open! Hit me.<br />Hit me. Baby.
4232323 4233722 - Oh-ho-ho!<br />- Security!
4233883 4235202 No, you don't.
4235843 4237356 Holy shit!
4237443 4238671 Kev, up here! Throw it!
4238763 4239763 I got it!
4240443 4242718 Oh! Oh, my God, yes, yes! Yes, yes, yes!
4243403 4247157 Oh, no! No! No! Get away! Get away!
4251163 4252755 Okay. Oh!
4253083 4254562 Go to the other side!
4254643 4255996 Oh, my God!
4256083 4258039 Annie! Annie, where are you?
4258123 4260842 - Max! Max!<br />- Over here! Hey!
4267843 4269037 No, no, no!
4271363 4272591 Get off me!
4276523 4277523 No!
4279603 4281594 That was easy.
4284043 4285761 Oh.
4290363 4293435 Man, glass tables<br />are acting weird tonight.
4294283 4295921 Go, go, go!
4296363 4298115 Get in! Get in the van!
4298203 4299795 Get in, get in, get in!
4299883 4301919 Get them! Get them!
4317443 4320833 So, you don't wanna have a baby,<br />so we can do more shit like that?
4321643 4323634 No. No.
4323963 4326193 Is that the fruit<br />you were thinking about?
4326363 4328240 Mmm-mmm.<br />That's not the fruit. No.
4328403 4329916 Hey, thanks for the assist.
4330083 4331562 Yeah.
4332043 4334398 I don't even know why<br />I really did it.
4335123 4336963 Do you think<br />it's 'cause you're falling for me?
4339163 4340163 I...
4341043 4342715 Not... Not sure.
4343043 4345637 Ugh. I was joking.
4345803 4347361 Oh. Okay. Yeah.
4348403 4350359 Aren't you gonna say<br />you were joking, too?
4350523 4351751 Do you want me to?
4351923 4353339 - Oh, my God, you're making this weird.<br />- No, I'm not.
4353363 4354876 - Stop it.<br />- Okay, fine.
4354963 4357059 It's two minutes to 12:00.<br />Where the hell is this bridge?
4357083 4360120 GPS says it's right around here,<br />but I don't see it.
4360203 4362000 Oh, oh. Oh. There it is. 4th Street.
4362083 4363363 Oh, shit!
4369483 4371474 - Oh, my!<br />- That's great.
4372043 4374159 That's great.<br />Now they're gonna kill my brother.
4376203 4377272 Oh, God!
4377843 4379242 Hold on.
4380243 4383440 I'm not an expert,<br />but these gems look plastic to me.
4383523 4385718 "Made in China."<br />Is this thing not even real?
4385803 4387600 Maybe just that sticker<br />was made in China.
4387683 4389019 - Let's let them talk.<br />- Can I see?
4389043 4391843 Hey, why would the Bulgarian<br />ask Brooks to bring him a fake egg?
4391923 4394915 Uh, I don't think he wanted<br />an egg at all.
4395003 4397995 I think he wanted<br />what was inside the egg.
4398963 4401079 "WITSEC." What is that?
4401203 4402238 Um...
4402323 4403995 We could ask them?
4421323 4423200 You tell anyone<br />we were coming here?
4423363 4424682 No.
4424843 4425992 I've got your egg.
4426083 4427083 You do?
4427163 4428642 Yeah, but we broke it.
4428803 4430236 - What?<br />- Well, it was a fake.
4430363 4431979 But we have the list of names<br />that was inside.
4432003 4433402 That's what you wanted, right?
4436803 4438873 Okay. Get on the ground.
4438963 4440819 We've got what you want.<br />Can't you just let us go?
4440843 4443118 I said, "On the ground!"
4444043 4445819 You, too, playboy, get over there.<br />Get on the ground.
4445843 4446958 Yeah.
4447043 4448843 None of that<br />child pose bullshit, either.
4449443 4452003 The Bulgarian's gonna kill me,<br />probably you guys, too.
4452163 4453391 Why did you come here?
4453683 4455459 Because you're my brother,<br />and I can't just let you die,
4455483 4456659 even though you might deserve it.
4456683 4458799 Yeah, it's me. We got them all here.
4458963 4461557 You're unbelievable, you know that?
4461723 4463873 You've always<br />been a better person than me.
4464043 4465635 You gotta shut up. Okay?
4465803 4468715 Listen. I'm a fraud, Max.
4468883 4471556 I'm not the carefree dude<br />that wins at everything he touches.
4471643 4474077 You know how I win?<br />I cheat. I cheat at everything.
4474163 4476279 I even cheated when we were kids<br />playing Battleship.
4478003 4479231 What?
4479323 4482793 Didn't you ever wonder why I made you<br />sit with your back to the TV?
4482883 4485681 It was so I could see your ships<br />in the reflection.
4485763 4489278 I mean, I even took five grand<br />every time we played Monopoly
4489363 4490963 before we even started playing the game.
4491043 4494433 I cheated at the Game of Life.<br />And at the game of life.
4494603 4495922 You son of a bitch.
4496003 4498198 - You son of a bitch!<br />- Sit down.
4499283 4501299 - What about you, Princess?<br />- I don't have anything.
4501323 4504759 But it didn't stop there<br />because, when we grew up, Max,
4504843 4507118 you went off to college, and I...
4508203 4510239 You got a career.
4510443 4513037 You married the greatest girl<br />in the world.
4513203 4515034 I knew I couldn't keep up<br />with that success.
4515203 4517080 So I...
4517283 4519399 I told everyone that I got a job<br />on Wall Street.
4519563 4520962 And I did.
4521163 4523916 Selling coke to traders.
4525283 4526432 You didn't invest in Panera?
4526603 4528002 I ate at Panera.
4528163 4529721 Jesus Christ.
4529803 4531600 What's going on?
4531683 4533539 But that's why I've been trying<br />to make it up to you.
4533563 4534939 That's what this whole game night<br />was about.
4534963 4537955 See, I had it rigged<br />so that you'd finally win.
4539003 4541915 The last clue was gonna lead you...
4542003 4543322 Your jacket pocket.
4553083 4554516 Huh.
4556923 4558675 Surprise!
4561883 4564841 I even managed to fuck that up, though.<br />I'm so sorry.
4564923 4566914 I'm so sorry, Max.
4568803 4570953 I think we're gonna be okay, though.<br />I got a feeling.
4571043 4572237 You want us to kill them all?
4573323 4574358 What?
4574443 4576099 - Okay.<br />- Wait, wait. Just let us go.
4576123 4577299 We won't tell anyone anything.
4577323 4579083 We got you the list!
4579283 4581717 - What the fuck, man?<br />- Fuck! God damn it!
4583723 4585019 - Oh, shit. The fuzz.<br />- Fuck, man!
4585043 4586362 Freeze!
4586603 4587638 Gary?
4587723 4588819 Don't even think about it, pig.
4588843 4590403 Can't say I care for that nomenclature.
4593683 4594798 Get down!
4595643 4597395 Come on, bitch!
4598963 4599963 Motherfucker!
4604723 4606122 God damn it!
4614243 4615676 Hey, isn't that your neighbor?
4616163 4617419 When did Gary get so cool?
4617443 4618478 Oh, my God!
4618563 4619678 Everybody okay?
4619803 4621459 - You're a cool-ass cat, Gary.<br />- You all right?
4621483 4623075 Fine, thank you,
4623883 4627592 though, in sliding, my belt buckle<br />may have inadvertently scratched
4627683 4629241 the finish of my squad car.
4629323 4630915 How did you know we were in trouble?
4631003 4633153 The nocturnal Jenga game,
4634043 4636238 my blood-spattered marital souvenirs,
4636363 4639992 and Max's curious search history<br />piqued my interest.
4640083 4642438 - Right. Oh, God.<br />- You, uh...
4642523 4644241 You saved our lives.
4644323 4645472 Thank you.
4646123 4647363 Just doing my job.
4649163 4650312 - Oh, my God!<br />- Oh!
4650403 4652473 - Shit!<br />- Oh, shit! Oh, shit!
4653683 4654718 Gary!
4656163 4657859 Hello? I need an ambulance.<br />Officer down.
4657883 4659379 - Oh, shit!<br />- Hang in there, pal.
4659403 4660756 Hang on. Hang on, pal.
4660843 4662019 Hang on. You're gonna be all right.
4662043 4663219 We're gonna get you to a hospital.
4663243 4664881 Okay, look at me. Gary, look.
4664963 4666919 You have got a lot to live for, okay?
4667003 4668003 Do I?
4668083 4669562 - Yeah. Yeah, yeah.<br />- Yeah.
4669643 4671520 I have no wife.
4672963 4674635 - No friends.<br />- That's not true.
4674803 4675918 No, don't say that.
4676083 4677939 - You got us. We're your friends.<br />- You've got us.
4677963 4682434 You don't even like<br />spending time with me.
4682523 4683842 Yes, we do. We just...
4683923 4685595 We've been a little selfish. That's all.
4685683 4687419 - Right, right.<br />- You know, I'm sorry about that.
4687443 4688443 Oh, God. Oh, God.
4688523 4690320 - Bastian.<br />- Huh?
4691683 4694277 Someone please take care of Bastian.
4694363 4697514 Gary, you are gonna take care of Bastian<br />yourself, okay?
4697603 4698779 Listen, soon as you get out<br />of the hospital,
4698803 4700883 you're gonna come to every single<br />game night we have.
4702003 4703322 Don't...
4703683 4704752 Yeah?
4704843 4707755 Don't you ever
4709603 4711594 exclude me again.
4711683 4714561 - Never exclude you again, pal.<br />- No.
4716323 4718632 - Oh, God. What is that?<br />- What's that?
4718723 4720679 Is that a blood clot?
4721243 4723552 It's a blood capsule.
4723643 4725315 - Huh?<br />- A blood capsule?
4726203 4729912 And that is how<br />you do a game night.
4733563 4734632 What?
4736763 4738401 I've duped you all.
4738483 4739483 Wha...
4740403 4743679 Hold on a second. Are you telling me<br />that this whole thing was a game?
4746243 4747471 - What? What?<br />- Damn!
4747563 4748563 Shit!
4748683 4750401 I'm sorry. They got up. They got up.
4750483 4752779 When I learned you stopped inviting me<br />to your game nights,
4752803 4755601 I hijacked<br />Brooks's murder mystery party,
4755683 4757514 and I staged a kidnapping of my own.
4757603 4759082 You gotta be kidding me.
4759163 4762360 What better way to prove my worth<br />as a game night participant?
4762443 4764479 Well, what about these dudes?<br />Are they actors?
4764563 4766519 Oh, no. They're... They're felons.
4766603 4767603 Felons?
4767683 4769339 I was able to shave some time off<br />of their parole
4769363 4771558 in exchange<br />for this little side project.
4771803 4772918 We square now?
4773003 4774322 Thank you, gentlemen.
4774403 4775677 That lady hit me with the car.
4775763 4777379 Hey, what the hell kind of psycho<br />are you?
4777403 4779997 You put us through all this,<br />just for your own amusement?
4780083 4783439 No, no. Just the opposite.<br />For your amusement.
4783523 4784672 Did everyone have fun?
4784803 4786441 - No! No.<br />- Yeah. No.
4786523 4788161 No fun! I got shot!
4788243 4789312 By me!
4789403 4791963 I don't see how that's possible.<br />My men were using blanks.
4792043 4793999 Well, that was my gun.<br />It was a real gun.
4794083 4796756 So, this whole thing, the Fabergé egg,
4796843 4798356 the Bulgarian, that was you?
4800043 4801112 You've lost me.
4801203 4803353 The egg, the WITSEC list?
4803443 4805479 It's all you. All part of your game?
4809083 4811659 This is a list of people in<br />the Federal Witness Protection program.
4811683 4812798 How did you get this?
4812883 4815272 From inside the egg.<br />Stop fucking with us. It's over!
4815363 4818082 I'm not fudging with you.<br />I honestly have no idea what...
4820083 4822438 Oh, boy. Yikes!
4823323 4825099 - I mean, how stupid do you think we are?<br />- Hey, Max.
4825123 4827159 Gang, are we looking<br />at the big twist here?
4827243 4828756 He gets shot again!
4828843 4831499 And by who? A couple of new characters<br />you introduce at the last minute.
4831523 4833036 Dude, you've jumped the shark!
4833123 4834715 Do you go to the magic shop
4834803 4837043 - to buy a bunch of these little bullets?<br />- No.
4839123 4840476 Hang on.
4840563 4843521 This is Officer Kingsbury.<br />We got a 10-00 on the 4th Street.
4846523 4848753 Which one of you is Brooks Davis?
4851563 4854202 It's funny.<br />You don't look like an asshole.
4854963 4856999 Do I look like an asshole to you?
4857563 4858632 No.
4858723 4860998 One of us has to be the asshole<br />in this transaction
4861083 4863677 because otherwise I'd have my egg,<br />and you'd have your money.
4863763 4867119 But instead, we've wasted our night<br />tracking you down.
4868883 4870601 Now, we're gonna have to kill you.
4870683 4872321 - What? No, no, no, no.<br />- What?
4872683 4874116 Mr. Bulgarian, I'm assuming?
4874283 4877161 Hi, I'm Max.<br />I'm Brooks's brother.
4877243 4879313 And, you know, look. He screwed up.
4879403 4880659 - Right? You got greedy.<br />- Oh, yeah.
4880683 4881718 He admits it.
4881803 4883680 Good news is, though,<br />that we got your egg.
4884163 4886518 It is broken. Uh, my screw up.
4886603 4889071 But, um, I got the list.
4889163 4890963 which I bet you've been after<br />this whole time.
4891043 4892043 What about this?
4892123 4894034 How about
4894683 4898676 you take this list for free,<br />and we all go our separate ways?
4898763 4900719 Nobody gets hurt.
4900803 4903761 Uh, except the poor folks on this list,<br />I'm guessing.
4905963 4907078 Okay.
4907763 4908763 Okay?
4908883 4911443 Deal. Makes perfect sense.
4911523 4913523 No, no. You give him that list,<br />he's gonna kill me.
4913563 4914882 That's nonsense.
4917803 4919634 What the hell is wrong with you?
4920123 4922079 I'm just trying to buy myself some time.
4922163 4925235 Not much. We're just gonna<br />cut it out of you on the jet. Take him.
4928803 4930475 Don't follow us, Max. I'm serious!
4930563 4932679 I'm not worried about that.
4936323 4937802 You just letting them go?
4937883 4939953 Yeah, they've done nothing wrong.
4940083 4942074 Only this one.
4942403 4943836 - Let's go.<br />- Don't follow us!
4943923 4945959 Gary! He's breathing.
4947123 4949379 You know, the only private air terminal<br />around here is at Conway.
4949403 4950961 Yeah. How are we gonna get there?
4951483 4952939 Brooks's house is<br />not that far from here.
4952963 4954078 But our car's not there.
4955283 4956432 Yeah, it is.
4966323 4969042 You know, you don't have to do this<br />because I can just poop it out.
4969883 4973193 We're not gonna go digging<br />through your feces. That's disgusting!
4973323 4975359 Now, hold still<br />while I cut your stomach open.
4975443 4976762 No, no! No! Whoa!
4978043 4979317 What the hell?
4981603 4983400 - Is that...<br />- That's my brother.
4983483 4985041 Get us in the air.
4985123 4986123 Now!
4997243 4998278 - Hold on!<br />- Oh!
5001923 5003197 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, you?
5003283 5004398 - Yup, good.<br />- Okay.
5009083 5010675 Okay, okay. What's our plan?
5010763 5012162 I have one idea.
5012243 5014518 It's so crazy, though, baby,<br />it just might work.
5014603 5015779 You're gonna<br />crash the car into the plane,
5015803 5017634 like Liam Neeson in Taken 3?
5018003 5019595 He did that in Taken 3, huh?
5024163 5026083 - All right, are you ready? Here we go!<br />- Uh-huh.
5027643 5029235 Oh, my God!
5032603 5034355 Uh, you missed it.
5034443 5035592 Thanks, baby.
5040683 5041752 Brooks, we're coming!
5041843 5042912 Whoo!
5061163 5064633 Well, at least I got<br />to drive it for 10 minutes.
5066883 5067998 Oh, my God.
5068163 5069278 - We have to hide.<br />- Yeah.
5069443 5070558 Okay. Go.
5070643 5073794 Oh, shit! Shit! Shit!
5074043 5075601 Go, go, go! It's stuck.
5076963 5078032 Fuck!
5078963 5080362 God damn it!
5098323 5099597 Where you at, lady?
5099683 5101674 Come on, you little bitch.
5102643 5104474 I know you're back here somewhere.
5106003 5108801 Let's end this shit.<br />I won't kill you. Come out!
5109843 5111720 Come on, get your ass out here!
5111883 5113111 Turn on the belt!
5113203 5114203 What?
5114283 5115659 - I'm not gonna hurt you.<br />- Look at the box!
5115683 5118072 - Let's talk!<br />- Can you charade it to me?
5118163 5119994 Charades?
5120603 5122798 That's some cute full-circle bullshit.
5122883 5124521 Here we go. Three words.
5124643 5125758 Come on, lady.
5125843 5126878 Where are you?
5129323 5130358 Turn.
5130443 5131637 Turn, turn, turn. Turn.
5132123 5133158 On.
5133243 5136076 Turn on. Turn on what? Turn on what?
5137603 5139673 Turn on belt?
5139843 5142403 Turn on belt!
5151363 5153593 Boy, that's a slow belt.
5164563 5166076 Hey!
5166443 5168752 Oh, God! Annie!
5171443 5173001 Oh, boy, that was...
5173083 5174299 You saw what I was going for,<br />though, right?
5174323 5175323 Yeah, yeah.
5175443 5177739 But then did you see when I hit him<br />with the fire extinguisher?
5177763 5180019 - I sure did. I sure did, yeah.<br />- That was cool, right? Yeah.
5180043 5181112 - Yeah.<br />- Great.
5181203 5182203 Do you want this?
5182323 5184518 Well, I don't want you to have it,<br />Calamity Jane.
5184603 5185797 All right, look.
5185883 5188158 I think I saw a hatch<br />at the top of the plane.
5188243 5189562 Maybe I can get the drop on him.
5189643 5191076 - "The drop"?<br />- Yup, yeah.
5191163 5192163 Who are you?
5192243 5193339 Why don't you go use<br />the emergency phone? Call for help.
5193363 5194363 I'm gonna do the drop.
5194443 5196399 Okay. You're not Liam Neeson!
5196483 5198394 - That hurts my feelings!<br />- I'm sorry!
5208563 5210235 That's enough of this shit.
5230283 5231283 Max!
5232763 5234179 I can't get the drop on anyone tonight.
5234203 5235397 Put that little knife down!
5235483 5237075 Right now! That's it.
5237523 5239115 Ahh!
5239523 5241483 Right in my bullet hole.
5246403 5248155 Come on, come on, come on.
5251963 5252963 Shit!
5257563 5258563 Stop!
5259883 5261202 Drop it!
5263043 5264078 Wait, wait. Um...
5264443 5267992 You don't have to do this.<br />I have kids at home.
5268603 5270082 Not with that ass you don't.
5270483 5271598 Oh.
5271683 5273321 Well, thank you.
5273643 5274712 You're welcome.
5277683 5279799 Shit!
5281643 5283076 Yes!
5283883 5285874 Oh, no, he died!
5302222 5309974 Subtitle Sync by: Aren Zo<br />Insta: @aren.zo
5316483 5318997 And that's how<br />you get the drop on someone!
5319083 5320152 Oh, my God!
5321003 5322402 Oh. Oh!
5322483 5324360 - I got you! I got you!<br />- This is high.
5326123 5327158 You're amazing.
5327243 5328803 - You can cut me loose now.<br />- Thank you!
5328923 5330117 Okay. Okay, okay.
5330283 5332035 - Uh...<br />- Yeah. In the bag.
5332203 5334003 - This? Okay.<br />- Look in the bag. That's right.
5334243 5335471 Okay.
5335883 5336918 Oh! Thank you!
5337003 5338959 - Okay. You all right?<br />- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
5341843 5342912 Whoa.
5343003 5344277 Well, look at that.
5344483 5346121 You put a bungee cord in your hand,
5346203 5348159 you go straight to the pervy place,<br />don't you?
5348283 5349283 Hey.
5349363 5351081 You saved my life. Thank you.
5351563 5352962 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
5353043 5355557 I mean, I just saw a man die,<br />but I'm... I'm okay.
5356963 5358840 Is that a knife in your bullet hole?
5358923 5360561 Uh-huh. Hey. I wanna have a baby.
5361123 5362238 Uh, what?
5362323 5363619 I used to think that<br />I wanted Brooks' life,
5363643 5365315 but, you know, turns out he was just...
5365403 5366961 You're a loser. He's a loser.
5367043 5368078 Uh, guilty.
5368163 5369676 But us making a family?
5369883 5372920 That's... That's not pellets.<br />That's the fruit.
5373083 5374801 That's fruit. It's fruit.
5374883 5376202 Wait. What's going on?
5376483 5378758 Plus, think about all the dumdums<br />that have kids, right?
5378843 5381499 And think about how much better<br />our kid is gonna be than their kids.
5381523 5383354 It's gonna beat their kids<br />at everything.
5383483 5384996 It's taken you this long to see that?
5385083 5386994 Our baby is gonna crush<br />every other baby.
5387083 5389059 That's right. That's right.<br />And not in that "peak too early,"
5389083 5390379 you know, "kid actor" kind of way,<br />you know?
5390403 5391403 Mmm-mmm. No.
5391483 5393439 We will parcel out<br />his or her gifts over time.
5393523 5394592 - Absolutely.<br />- Yes.
5394683 5396019 We gotta teach it Mandarin right away.
5396043 5397083 'Cause China's the future.
5397163 5398391 - It sure is.<br />- Yeah.
5398483 5400201 - You're the future.<br />- Oh, my God.
5403603 5405116 Hmm?
5406083 5408517 And that concludes my game night.
5409323 5410597 What?
5410683 5411779 It went exactly as I planned.
5411803 5414875 You learned every lesson<br />that I wanted you to.
5414963 5416794 Trevor, you can get up now.
5422003 5424723 I'm just fucking with you, but that<br />would've been really cool, right?
5424763 5426203 You're such a dick.
5435963 5437999 - Hey! Hey!<br />- Hey!
5439243 5440676 - Hey, hey!<br />- Hey!
5440843 5443676 Come on, come on. Hey, thanks<br />for letting me host again, huh?
5443843 5445640 Well, it's not like we had a choice.
5445803 5447555 Only 36 months to go.
5447723 5448979 Oh, time will fly.
5449003 5450259 - Can I get you a beer?<br />- Uh, yeah.
5450283 5451841 - Come on!<br />- Hey, listen, Brooks.
5452243 5454962 I know you're probably feeling<br />pretty humbled by all of this.
5455043 5458319 But, honestly, I think you're gonna come<br />out the other side a much better man.
5458723 5459872 Oh! Hey, look.
5459963 5461362 I completely agree.
5461443 5463115 You remember the WITSEC list<br />I swallowed?
5463203 5464397 - Sure.<br />- I pooped it out,
5464523 5467196 sold it for $3 million<br />on the black market.
5468083 5469914 - Are you serious?<br />- Pretty sweet, huh?
5470643 5472643 Brooks, everybody on that list<br />is gonna get killed.
5472803 5474122 Oh, no, Max, I'm not a monster.
5474323 5476518 I tipped everyone off<br />that they were in danger.
5476683 5478639 For $20,000 apiece.
5479763 5481099 You're unbelievable.
5481123 5483557 Thank you. It's not like<br />I'm gonna live in this dump forever.
5483643 5486339 As soon as this cuff comes off,<br />I'm gonna buy that house I was renting.
5486363 5487682 I'm moving in with Johanna.
5488283 5489352 There she is.
5489443 5490478 Hey, Dr. Chin!
5490563 5492042 Hey, Max.
5492123 5493476 - Let's play.<br />- Yeah.
5494283 5495432 Uh, The Crying Game?
5495843 5496878 Uh, Boys Don't Cry?
5496963 5498874 Is that a tear? No, is that the actor?
5499043 5500379 - Mr. Potato Head.<br />- Are you drawing the actor?
5500403 5501472 - Cry-Baby?<br />- Yes!
5501603 5502672 Time!
5502763 5504640 - It was The Green Mile.<br />- What?
5504723 5506281 How is that The Green Mile?
5506883 5509317 This is me at the Regal Cinema crying
5509443 5511911 as I did through much of the film.
5513003 5514603 How were we supposed to know that, Gary?
5514643 5517840 I assume everyone cried<br />during The Green Mile.
5518803 5519803 So, who's next?
5519883 5520883 I'll go.
5520963 5522282 - Yeah!<br />- Go, baby!
5522363 5523499 - Yeah!<br />- Nice try, Gary.
5523523 5525036 And go!
5525603 5526638 Uh...
5526723 5528379 - It's a rock.<br />- A bean? A rock!
5528403 5529677 - A ball?<br />- That's a...
5529763 5531179 - Burger. Is that a burger?<br />- Football! Football!
5531203 5532779 No, oh,<br />that's a dinner roll, right?
5532803 5533997 - A bun!<br />- Bread?
5534083 5535880 Is it a bun? Looks like a bun.
5535963 5536963 French loaf?
5537043 5539219 - Is this a motion picture?<br />- Bun is in a house. On a train.
5539243 5540459 Aren't you supposed<br />to announce it?
5540483 5542339 - Microwave?<br />- It's being cooked. It's in an oven.
5542363 5543899 - Bun in the oven!<br />- Yes, yes, yes!
5543923 5546801 Wait. What?
5547203 5548636 Yes.
5549763 5550832 You pregnant?
5550923 5552402 We did it.
5560523 5562798 Oh, my gosh!<br />They're having a baby!
5562883 5564521 They're having a baby!
5974123 5975397 How you doing?
5975483 5977394 - Hi.<br />- I'm Kenny.
5977483 5979075 Nice to meet you, Kenny.
5980323 5983235 Usually people cut me off<br />and say they know who I am.
5983323 5986440 - Oh, yeah?<br />- Yeah. I didn't catch your name.
5987283 5988796 I'm Debbie.
