113997 115915 Allan, bomb squad ...
115999 119293 special services, state police and the FBI!
119378 122797 Lieutenant Jurgenson, Upummer!<br />I want you to go to St. Johns Emergency ...
122880 125633 in case we got any walk-ins from the street.
125717 127969 - Take that down -<br />- Kramer, get the city engineer!
128053 130805 I gotta find out a damage report.<br />It's very important.
130889 133558 Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want<br />to blow up a department store?
133642 135893 Did you ever see a woman<br />miss a shoe sale?
135978 139147 Connie, I want you to get started<br />on the witness sheet. Ricky, you and Joe ...
139230 141649 you make sure the uniforms<br />got it cordoned off there.
141733 144944 And you don't let<br />the damn TV crews in. Benson!
145028 147989 - Inspector, phone.<br />- Not now. Benson! Traffic!
148073 151826 We get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3:00,<br />or we got the traffic jam from hell!
151910 153828 - Walter!<br />- Yeah?
153912 157290 I think you'd better take this.
159209 161127 Major Case Unit,<br />Inspector Cobb.
161210 164172 Said Simple Simon to<br />the pie man going to the fair ...
164256 166174 "Give me your pies ...
166258 168843 or I'll cave your head in."
168927 172430 You see, Bonwit's was just to make sure<br />I had your attention.
172514 175892 Is there a detective<br />named McClane there?
175976 181063 - He's on suspension.<br />- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.
181148 183774 - Who is this?<br />- Call me Simon.
183859 187028 - What do you want?<br />- I want to play a game.
187112 190072 - What kind of game?<br />- "Simon Says."
191450 194076 Simon's going to tell<br />Lieutenant McClane what to do ...
194160 197496 and Lieutenant McClane<br />is going to do it.
197580 201042 Non-compliance<br />will result in a penalty.
201126 205922 - What penalty?<br />- Another big bang in a very public place.
208800 211761 What is it that you want<br />Lieutenant McClane to do?
211845 217058 Simon says Lieutenant McClane is to go to the<br />corner of 138th Street und Amsterdam ...
217142 219936 - which is in Harlem if I'm not mistaken.<br />- Kowalski!
220020 222980 Lambert!<br />You know where to find McClane?
223065 225775 Well, I kinda doubt<br />you're gonna find him in church.
225859 228736 Well, you better find out<br />what rock he's under ...
228820 230905 and kick it over.
242250 244627 John.
244710 246671 Thanks.
253762 256305 Give me some more.<br />Come on.
257557 260643 Jesus, John.<br />You look like shit.
263313 267608 Where did we leave off with that roster?
267693 271153 We got three killings in<br />Red Hook the past two nights.
271238 273656 Put Miner on it.<br />And Genetti.
273740 275950 The mayor's office will call<br />before the day's out.
276034 280454 Next: 14 dump trucks stolen<br />from a yard in Staten Island.
280539 284750 Fourteen. Jesus! Is somebody starting<br />a construction company?
284835 287628 Nah, it was John's landlady<br />going to clean his apartment.
290048 292258 Insurance fraud.
292342 294844 That's a priority out in California.
294928 297388 The contractor splits the money<br />with the thieves.
297472 299432 We had that out in Jersey<br />a couple years ago, Joe. Remember?
299516 301517 See what Kelly can do with it.
303687 305980 Hey, what was<br />the lottery number last night?
306064 307898 4667.
307983 311819 You still bettin' your badge, Rick?
311903 314697 Yeah. 6991 every week.
316325 318409 6991. Lucky number.
318493 320870 Half the cops in New York<br />play their badges.
320954 323080 How are the kids, John?
324958 327710 I hear they're okay.
327794 330713 Did you talk with Holly?
332132 334467 No, I didn't talk to Holly.
334550 337011 Coming up on it, Inspector.
338263 340514 Is it hot in here<br />or am I just scared to death?
340599 343059 You want to make sure<br />the gun's secure?
343143 345686 Yeah, it's good.
352694 356072 You know, you're the first woman<br />since Holly who's seen me do this.
356156 358199 I'm honored.
358283 360659 Yeah, so was she.
362662 367249 So, where's the backup gonna be?
370462 373464 We're gonna drop back<br />to 128th Street.
373548 376050 What?
376134 379178 Ten blocks?<br />Are you fucking kidding me?
379262 382139 Oh, man, that's just great.<br />Hey, Walter, what is all this about, huh?
382224 385351 If we don't do it, this guy says he's gonna<br />blow up another public place.
385435 388771 - Well, why me? What does it got to do with me?<br />- I have no idea.
388855 391023 He just said it had to be you.
391108 394443 Well, it's nice to be needed.
394528 396445 Frankly, John,<br />you haven't been -
396530 399281 Hey, Walter, how about you mind<br />your fucking business about Holly, huh?
399366 401700 Between you and Simon ...
401785 405037 you're fucking up<br />a perfectly good hangover.
407374 410501 Okay.
417843 421262 We'll be back to pick you up in 15 minutes.
421346 424682 Take your time.<br />I expect to be dead in four.
424766 427143 Let's go, Billy!
449166 451417 Oh, man.
478153 480821 - Hey, yo, Uncle!<br />- Come look at this.
482949 486827 - It's ten after 9:00. Why aren't you in school?<br />- Tony wants to sell you this.
486912 490206 Tony? That no-neck dude<br />they call "Bad T"?
490290 492583 He says he found it<br />in a Dumpster.
492667 494627 He keeps stealing from people,<br />they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.
494710 497755 No, he didn't steal it.<br />He says his uncle gave it to him.
497839 500758 Mm-hmm. Hand me<br />that newspaper over there.
503929 507806 Don't ever let people use you. You're running<br />all over town with stolen property.
507890 511560 If you get caught, you get in trouble while he<br />gets to deny the whole thing and walk away.
511645 515523 You - You mean you want us<br />to take it back to Tony?
515607 519109 No, I'll take it back<br />to Tony, with a message.
520153 522154 - Now, where you goin'?<br />- School.
522239 524365 - Why?<br />- To get educated.
524449 526617 - Why?<br />- So we can go to college.
526700 528869 - And why is that important?<br />- To get 'espect.
528954 531080 "Respect."<br />Now, who's the bad guys?
531164 533541 - Guys who sell drugs.<br />- Guys who have guns.
533625 535918 - And who's the good guys?<br />- We're the good guys.
536002 538212 - Who's gonna help you?<br />- Nobody.
538296 540464 - So who's gonna help you?<br />- We're gonna help ourselves.
540549 543842 - And who do we not want to help us?<br />- White people.
543927 545886 That's right.
545970 548389 Now get on outta here.<br />Go to school.
552519 555521 - Uncle, you better come look at this.<br />- What?
555605 558649 - There's a white man standing in the street.<br />- I seen one.
558733 560651 Not like this.
570370 573080 Dial 911. Tell the police<br />to get up here quick.
573164 576166 Somebody's about to get killed.
576250 579420 - And get your butts to school. You hear me?<br />- Yeah.
579504 581505 All right.
585552 587845 You better back off, man.
605780 609491 - Morning.<br />- Good morning.
609576 612286 You having a nice day, sir?<br />You feeling all right?
612370 615164 Not to get too personal ...
615248 617458 but a white man standing<br />in the middle of Harlem ...
617542 619918 wearing a sign that says<br />"I Hate Niggers" ...
620003 623464 has either got some serious personal issues<br />or not all his dogs are barking.
623548 625549 Hey!
625634 630262 I'm talkin' to you! Now you got about<br />10 seconds before those guys see you.
630347 633307 When they do, they will kill you.<br />You understand?
633390 636477 You are about to have<br />a very bad day.
636560 638896 Tell me about it.
638980 641774 Sir, this is a police matter.<br />For your own safety, I'm gonna ask you ...
641858 644109 - to step across the street.<br />- You're damn right it's a police matter!
644194 647529 For your own safety, I suggest you hide<br />your butt in my shop till the police get here.
647614 650574 What the fuck!
650659 653369 Aw, shit!
659376 661460 - Listen, I'm a cop.<br />- What?
661544 664254 I'm on a case. Somebody blew up<br />Bonwit Teller's an hour ago.
664339 666256 - Did you hear about that on the news?<br />- Yeah.
666340 668967 The same asshole who did that said I gotta do<br />this or he's gonna blow up something else.
669052 670636 - Do you understand?<br />- Shit.
670720 672638 - Listen, I got a gun -<br />- They got 10 guns.
672722 674640 - You should get across the street!<br />- Look, start acting crazy.
674724 676975 - What?<br />- Like Looney Tunes. You know, like Bellevue?
677060 681480 - Hey, Zeus, this a friend of yours?<br />- He look like a friend of mine?
681564 685651 I think the dude just escaped from<br />some hospital, you know? Like Bellevue?
689906 694076 I am the ...  voice of my own god.
694160 696245 And my god -
696329 698747 I told the librarian that I had<br />a bad headache, but she didn't believe me.
698832 701709 I really do have a bad headache, though.<br />I have a very bad headache!
701793 704086 - And my head does not feel -<br />- Oh, man, you shut the fuck -
704170 707423 You've made a very bad mistake.
707507 710092 Poke it through his head.
710176 712594 Cut this shit off him!
712679 715556 Fellas! Fellas!<br />Nature boy here hates niggers.
715640 717725 Now, what are we<br />gonna do about that?
717809 719768 Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo! Hold up! Hold up!
719853 722479 - Oh, shit!
725900 728026 - Back! Back up!<br />- Hey, what are you trippin' on?
728110 730946 Back the fuck up! Now!
731030 734116 Come on, man. Get up.
734200 737536 Get up! Get outta here!
737620 739747 Stop the c -<br />Stop the goddamn cab!
739830 742916 - Don't shoot! Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!<br />- Get up! Come on! Get up!
743000 744918 Back up! I mean it!
745003 748088 I don't want to, but I will!<br />You know I will! Come on, drive! Drive!
748173 750841 - Drive!<br />- Get the fuck outta here!
750925 753469 Drive! Drive!
753553 756805 Don't stop, don't stop! Just keep driving!<br />Run the red light! Drive!
756890 759266 - That's all I got!<br />- Put that fuckin' money away!<br />Nobody's robbing you, asshole.
759350 761268 - Don't kill me!<br />- Shit!
761352 764938 - Just run all the lights! Drive!<br />- Oh, man! Damn!
765023 767024 - That cut deep?<br />- How the hell would I know?
767108 769359 Just keep pressure on it.
769444 771361 - Oh, fuck!<br />- Goddamn!
771446 773363 - Jesús, right?
773448 775532 - John McClane. I owe you one -<br />- Damn right, you owe me!
775617 778494 - You got any idea what those guys<br />are doing to my shop right now?<br />- Chill out, Jesús!
778578 781205 "Chill out"? What the fuck? Are you trying<br />to relate to me? Talk like a white man!
781289 783207 Jesús, I'm sorry<br />you got involved, all right?
783290 785209 Why do you keep calling me Jesús?<br />I look Puerto Rican to you?
785293 787711 - Guy back there called you Jesús, didn't he?<br />- He didn't say Jesús!
787796 790589 He said, "Hey, Zeus!"<br />My name is Zeus.
790673 794134 - Zeus?<br />- Yeah, Zeus! As in father of Apollo? Mt. Olympus?
794219 797137 "Don't fuck with me or<br />I'll shove a lightning bolt up your ass!"
797222 799640 Zeus!<br />You got a problem with that?
799724 802768 No, I don't have a problem with that.
802852 804812 Downtown. Police Plaza.
804896 807105 Oh-ho!<br />Oh, that's just great.
811152 813445 Get a record<br />of all his collars, recent releases ...
813530 816615 and a list of anybody else<br />he might have looked at sideways.
818159 820160 It's a textbook megalomania.
820245 823205 It's a pathological state<br />in which fantasies of control ...
823289 825332 or omnipotence predominate.
825416 828919 He wants control over him - over his actions,<br />his thoughts, even his emotions.
829003 830796 Sounds like you got<br />a secret admirer, John.
830880 833006 Yeah, maybe he'll<br />send me some flowers.
833090 836301 - Everybody knows you like pansies.<br />- It's not that kind of emotion.
836386 838720 - This guy is ugly.<br />- How is that?
838805 841640 Nothing wrong with him<br />a shower wouldn't cure.
841724 843809 Beer is normally<br />taken internally, John.
843893 847688 - Just get me some aspirins, will ya?<br />- Okay. Hold this here.
847772 852359 - This is Fred Schiller, John. He's a -<br />- A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
852443 855779 Yes, I was saying that we're dealing<br />with a megalomaniacal personality ...
855864 857781 with possible<br />paranoid schizophrenia.
857866 860117 Hey, how about we just<br />skip down to the part ...
860200 862119 where you tell me what the fuck<br />this has to do with me, huh?
862203 866290 I don't know. I mean, what I do know is<br />it does have specifically to do with you.
866374 868876 This guy wants to pound<br />on you till you crumble.
868960 872963 - He wants you to dance to his tune, and then -<br />- Put on a dress and fuck me?
873047 877217 I was going to say kill you.
877302 880178 He's sitting on<br />an awful lot of rage ...
880263 883557 and it could be manifested physically<br />if he's stressed.
883640 886101 Someone he arrested?<br />Somebody he pissed off?
886185 889313 - That could be one hell of a long list.<br />- Fuck you, Joe.
889397 892024 See, these people don't<br />like to work anonymously.
892108 894359 They want you to know<br />who's doing it to you.
894444 898363 So this name Simon is probably not an alias.<br />It's probably Simon or some variation.
898448 902492 Simon, Robert E. Busted in '86,<br />extortion, kidnapping, 10 to 15.
902577 906705 Did seven years for good behavior. Released<br />on a state work-furlough two months ago.
906789 908707 - Check it.<br />- Thanks, Rick.
908790 911919 Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman<br />who kidnapped his partner's daughter.
912003 914838 He's a fuck-up, not a psycho.<br />The guy we're looking for is nuts.
914923 917841 A nut who knows a lot<br />about bombs.
917926 920802 We found this in a playground.<br />Professional.
920887 924389 Very cool stuff. You know, boom!
924474 927976 - You think you should slam it<br />around like that, Charlie?<br />- It's unmixed. You can't hurt it.
928060 930687 This stuff is cutting edge.<br />It's a binary liquid.
930772 935651 - A what?<br />- Like epoxy, two liquids.
935735 938487 Now, either one by itself ...
939822 943241 you got nothing,<br />but mix 'em -
954379 958006 Ricky?
960050 963011 Charlie, you're gonna be wearing<br />that chair up your ass!
963096 966306 - Christ Almighty, Charlie!<br />- Like I said, very cool stuff.
966390 969017 Now, with a package like this,<br />you get a warning.
969102 973063 Now, the bomb has to arm itself.<br />You'll see the red liquid ...
973147 975607 pump into the clear<br />before it detonates.
975692 979027 - How long before?<br />- Ten seconds, two minutes.
979112 981029 It could be anything.
981114 984116 But once it's mixed,<br />be somewhere else.
984200 986410 That stuff has gotta<br />be pretty rare.
986494 989454 We oughta be able to find out if<br />any of it's missing somewhere.
989539 991790 Already did.<br />Livermore Labs theft over the weekend.
991874 994167 He got enough to make<br />another one, Joe?
994252 997421 - About 2,000 pounds.<br />- Of that?
997505 1000924 The detonating mechanism<br />could be anything - radio, electrical.
1001009 1003593 Hell, you could use a beeper<br />and phone it in.
1003678 1005804 Inspector?<br />Inspector, it's him.
1005888 1008056 He's got a double Alberti feedback loop on it.
1008140 1010308 - A nasty little trick I believe once used in Lebanon.<br />- Charlie. Charlie!
1010393 1012519 - Charlie, shh!<br />- What -
1012603 1014896 You wanna start the trace?
1020987 1023155 Simon.
1023239 1026533 He wore the board,<br />walked the street and survived.
1026617 1029911 Where are my pigeons now?
1029996 1031997 Pigeons?
1032080 1035709 I had two pigeons, bright and gay,<br />fly from me the other day.
1035793 1039046 Why was it they did go?<br />You cannot tell. You do not know.
1039130 1043050 - You mean McClane?<br />- No, I mean Santa Claus.
1045636 1049056 - Yeah, I'm here.<br />- Ah, there after all. And your friend?
1049140 1051266 Carver! Carver!
1051350 1054061 Come on. We need you in the other room.<br />Let's go! Come on!
1054145 1056063 They need you. Go.
1056147 1058982 - Yeah, he's here too.<br />- And may I speak with him?
1061069 1064988 - Well, is the ebony Samaritan there now?<br />- You got a problem with ebony?
1065073 1068325 No, no. My only problem<br />is that I went to some trouble ...
1068409 1070577 preparing that game for McClane.
1070660 1072913 You interfered with a well-laid plan.
1072997 1077250 Yeah? Well, you can stick<br />your well-laid plan up your well-laid ass.
1079420 1082798 That was not smart.<br />There are lives at stake here!
1082882 1084883 Not enough time, Inspector.
1084967 1087177 You better hope he calls back.
1087260 1089888 He will.
1089972 1094101 Ricky, you wanna tell those people<br />to shut the hell up out there?
1094185 1097145 Hey, keep it down here!
1105154 1108615 Simon, he wasn't speaking<br />for all of us.
1108699 1111785 That was unpleasant.<br />Don't let it happen again.
1111869 1114079 So, what's your name, boy?
1114163 1116373 - Don't call me boy.<br />- I'm sorry.
1116457 1119042 It was a poor attempt<br />at humor.
1119127 1121211 I was going to send<br />you home with a chiding ...
1121295 1123755 - but now I think perhaps you should join the game.<br />- We got him!
1123840 1126049 It's a pay phone in Oslo.
1126134 1128301 - No, wait, they say it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Norway?
1128386 1131763 - Wait. Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Forget it!
1131848 1134808 Australia? He's scrambling up their system.<br />They don't know where he is.
1134892 1138019 Having fun with<br />the phone company, are we?
1138104 1140730 Simon says,<br />McClane and the Samaritan ...
1140815 1143900 will go to the subway station<br />at 72nd and Broadway.
1143985 1147404 I will call you in 15 minutes on the pay phone<br />outside the station.
1147488 1151074 No police. Failure to answer<br />will constitute non-compliance.
1151159 1153535 Do you understand me, John?
1153619 1156746 Oh, yes, I understand. I understand<br />that you're a fuckin' wacko ...
1156830 1159166 that likes to play kids' games,<br />that's what I understand.
1159250 1161209 - Hardly.<br />- "Hardly"?
1161294 1164629 Well, then, who are you?<br />Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?
1164714 1167132 Shoplifting? Purse snatching?
1167216 1169176 Cross-dressing? What?
1169260 1173388 You c-c-couldn't catch me if I stole<br />your ch-ch-chair with you in it.
1173472 1176725 My ch-ch-chair with me in it?<br />Ooh-hoo! That's very exciting.
1176809 1179144 Let me ask you a question,<br />bonehead.
1179228 1181563 Why are you trying to k-k-k-k-kill me?
1181647 1183607 - John, John, calm yourself.<br />- Huh?
1183690 1186693 Why don't you come on down here<br />and we'll figure this out like a couple of men?
1186777 1188695 Just come on down here.
1188779 1191573 - If killing you was all I wanted,<br />you'd be dead by now.<br />- Simon.
1191657 1195368 This is Inspector Cobb. I can appreciate<br />your feelings for McClane ...
1195453 1198121 but believe me,<br />the jerk isn't worth it.
1198206 1200665 He stepped on so many toes<br />in this department ...
1200750 1203376 by this time next month<br />he's going to be a security guard.
1203460 1205670 His own wife wants nothing<br />to do with him ...
1205755 1208840 and he's about two steps shy<br />of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.
1208925 1211343 One step. One step!
1211427 1213637 Now listen to me.
1213720 1217390 You sound like a real smart guy.<br />What is it that you want?
1217475 1219559 Are you talking about money?
1219644 1222354 Well, whatever, whatever.
1222438 1225190 McClane is a toilet bug.
1225274 1228902 Now what would it take just to forget him<br />and live happily ever after?
1228986 1231071 You know, money is shit to me.
1231155 1235242 I would not give up McClane<br />for all the gold in your Fort Knox.
1235326 1237953 72nd Street subway,<br />pay phone, 15 minutes.
1238037 1240455 McClane and the Samaritan.
1240539 1243208 If you're competent in the least,<br />you've found the briefcase.
1243292 1246253 So you know what I mean<br />by penalty.
1248673 1251341 I wanna thank you for that<br />vote of confidence, Walter.
1251425 1254678 Well, I thought it was worth a try.<br />This guy's a raving maniac.
1254762 1257222 He couldn't be any clearer<br />if he got it from a case history.
1257306 1260517 He gave you clues to his identity.<br />He spoke German.
1260600 1264604 He called it "your Fort Knox."<br />And he stammered when McClane pushed him.
1264689 1267607 Now, you believe this guy<br />really can't be bought?
1267692 1271569 There's no chance. The very mention<br />of money only enraged him further.
1278786 1281871 - What's that?<br />- It's your shield.
1281956 1284958 - You asking me to be a cop again, Walter?<br />- Ricky, get him his gun.
1285042 1287502 - You didn't answer my question.<br />- Joe, this time they go with back -
1287586 1291673 Hey! You didn't answer<br />my question, Walter.
1291757 1293675 Are you done, Lieutenant?
1293759 1296136 Now, you two<br />better get going ...
1296220 1298471 if you're going to get up<br />to 72nd Street on time.
1298556 1301141 - Joe, this time they go with backup.<br />- You got it.
1301225 1303977 - Come on, you guys!<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />I'm not going anywhere.
1304060 1308148 - Simon says you gotta go!<br />- I'm not jumping through hoops for some psycho.
1308232 1311109 That's a white man with white problems.<br />You deal with him.
1311193 1313320 Call me when he crosses<br />110th Street.
1313404 1316156 Hey! Why'd you save my ass?
1316240 1320243 I didn't. I stopped a white cop<br />from getting killed in Harlem.
1320328 1322954 One white cop gets killed today ...
1323039 1326207 tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,<br />all of them with itchy trigger fingers.
1326292 1328877 Got it?
1328960 1331588 Get him back.
1331672 1335216 - Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?<br />- Chinatown.
1335300 1337344 Shit.
1337428 1340263 Zeus! Yo, partner!<br />Wait up!
1340348 1342515 Hey, hey, hey, hey.<br />I ain't your partner.
1342600 1346936 I ain't your neighbor, your brother<br />or your friend. I'm your total stranger.
1347020 1349272 Okay. Stranger ...
1349357 1352984 you know where that park<br />is at 115th Street and St. Nicholas?
1354445 1356446 Yeah, it's in Harlem.
1356530 1359282 Where do you think<br />we found that bomb?
1359367 1364662 Listen, this guy doesn't care<br />about skin color, even if you do.
1366874 1370418 - What am I doin'?<br />- Cheer up. Things could be worse.
1370503 1373129 I was working on<br />a nice, fat suspension ...
1373214 1376299 smokin' cigarettes<br />and watching Captain Kangaroo.
1376384 1378385 Come on.
1380805 1382931 Is that the phone?
1384392 1388019 They made it to the phone.
1388104 1390897 - But there's a problem.<br />- What do you mean? How big a problem?
1390980 1393191 Oh, about 300 pounds.
1393275 1395110 Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
1395194 1397195 - We need this phone for official police business.<br />- Do you mind?
1397279 1399280 - Honey, I'm a cop. I need the phone right now -<br />- I'm sorry, but I -
1399365 1402742 - Get off the damn phone, lady! Police business!<br />- Well, I never!
1402827 1407038 - I can get used to this.<br />- I'm sure you can find a phone<br />across the street, ma'am.
1407123 1409833 Let's get something straight. I'm the only one<br />here on official police business.
1409917 1412752 - Don't ever do that shit again.<br />- Let's get something else straight.
1412837 1416965 You need me a lot more than I need you.<br />You don't like the way I do things, fine.
1417049 1419759 I quit.
1424890 1428393 All right, I need you.
1434817 1438153 All right, I need you more<br />than you need me.
1441030 1442824 Hello.
1442908 1445577 Birds of a feather flock together.<br />So do pigs and swine.
1445660 1448872 Rats and mice have their chance,<br />as will I have mine.
1448956 1450915 Nice. lt rhymes.
1451000 1454586 - Why was the phone busy? Who were you calling?<br />- The psychic hotline.
1454670 1456629 I'd advise you to take this<br />more seriously.
1456714 1458631 Look, it's a public phone!<br />What do you want me to say?
1458716 1462760 You can simply say there was a fat woman<br />on it and it took you a minute to get her off?
1464388 1467557 Now, John, there's a significant amount<br />of explosive ...
1467640 1469934 in the trash receptacle<br />next to you.
1471770 1474314 Try to run,<br />and it goes up now.
1474398 1478026 - Nobody's gonna run, but<br />I got 100 people out here.<br />- That's the point.
1478110 1480445 Now, do I have your attention?
1480529 1483072 As I was going to St. Ives,<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1483157 1486993 Every wife had seven sacks. Every sack<br />had seven cats. Every cat had seven kittens.
1487077 1490163 Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.<br />How many were going to St. Ives?
1490247 1493875 - My phone number is 555 -<br />- No, no, no! Wait! I didn't get all that! Say it again!
1493959 1498004 - Not a chance. My phone<br />number is 555 and the answer.<br />- But I didn't-
1498088 1500507 Call me in 30 seconds or die.
1502635 1504969 All right, seven guys<br />with seven wives -
1505054 1507680 - Shut up, McClane. I'm good at this.<br />- Seven guys with seven wives -
1507765 1510183 Shut the fuck up, McClane!<br />He said seven wives with seven sacks.
1510267 1514187 - Seven times seven is 49. Now tell me the rest.<br />- Uh, a sack with seven -
1514270 1516189 - Weren't you listening?<br />- Yeah! I didn't hear every fuckin' -
1516273 1518608 - What is wrong with you?<br />- Besides having a bad fucking<br />hangover, for one thing!
1518692 1520527 All right, all right!
1520610 1524447 Seven wives times seven, 49. With seven cats.<br />Seven times 49 is ...  343, right?
1524532 1526407 - Are you asking me or telling me?<br />- I'm telling you.
1526492 1530328 343 times seven is -<br />One, zero, 24. 2,401!
1530412 1532956 - That's what you got, right?<br />- Yeah, that's what I got.
1533040 1535041 - Is that it, 2,401?<br />- That's it. Dial.
1535125 1537627 555-2401.
1539463 1541881 - No, wait, wait! It's a trick, it's a trick.<br />- What? What do you mean?
1541966 1545093 - I forgot about the man.<br />- What man? Fuck the man! We got 10 seconds!
1545177 1547428 He said, how many were going<br />to St. Ives, right?
1547513 1551516 The riddle begins: As I was going to St. Ives,<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1551600 1554227 - The guy and his wives aren't going anywhere.<br />- What are they doing?
1554310 1556980 Sittin' in the fuckin' road waiting on -<br />How the hell should I know, McClane?
1557064 1560233 - Who's going to St. Ives then?<br />- The guy. Just the guy.
1560317 1562569 - Just one guy? Just one guy.<br />- The answer's one.
1562653 1564946 - How do you dial one?<br />- 555-0001.
1565030 1567365 Zero, zero, one.<br />Just one guy's goin'?
1567449 1570702 - Hello, John.<br />- Yeah, piece of cake! Give<br />us something harder next time.
1570786 1574539 - But you're 10 seconds late.<br />- No, no! The answer is one!
1574623 1577667 There's a bomb in the trash!<br />Get down!
1577750 1580003 Get down!
1580087 1582255 There's a bomb!
1582339 1585049 Get down!<br />There's a bomb!
1587886 1590346 Welcome to New York.
1594350 1598187 Here, you can have it.<br />Come on. Come on. Let's go.
1612244 1614412 No bomb.
1620085 1623880 - Yeah.<br />- I didn't say, Simon says.
1623964 1628676 It's 9:50, John.<br />The number 3 train is arriving now.
1628760 1632138 I left something provocative on that train, John.
1632222 1634932 Simon says,<br />get to the pay phone ...
1635017 1638144 next to the news kiosk in<br />Wall Street station by 10:20 ...
1638228 1641439 or the number 3 train<br />and its passengers vaporize.
1641523 1645068 Use any means of travel<br />other than civilian, I blow the train.
1645152 1647820 Attempt to evacuate the subway,<br />I blow the train.
1647905 1652450 - I'll call you in 30 minutes. Be there.<br />- We're fucked.
1652534 1655828 Ninety blocks in 30 minutes<br />in New York traffic?
1655913 1658164 It could be double that.
1658248 1660875 We don't even have a car!
1660959 1663044 Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!<br />I'm a cop! I'm a cop!
1663128 1665296 - I am requisitioning this car<br />for official police business.<br />- What are you doing?
1665380 1667423 - Thank you very much.<br />- What the fuck are you doing to my car?
1667508 1669342 - Get in, get in!<br />- Pretty slick.
1669426 1672345 I used to drive a cab.<br />The fastest way south is -
1672429 1675765 What the fuck are you doing?
1679478 1681437 What were you saying?
1681522 1685650 I was saying, I used to drive a cab,<br />and Ninth Avenue was the fastest way south.
1685734 1688027 But we seem to be going east.
1691907 1694575 Where the hell are you going, McClane?
1694660 1696786 I told you Ninth Avenue<br />was the quickest way south!
1696870 1699414 Stop with that goddamn yelling!<br />I know what I'm doing!
1699498 1701082 Not even God knows<br />what you're doing!
1701166 1703835 They're headed east on 72nd<br />towards the park.
1703919 1707130 - But Wall Street is south!<br />- Man, stop yelling at me! I got a bad headache.
1707214 1710258 And the best way south is not Ninth Avenue.<br />It's through the park.
1712553 1716931 Oh, dear. I told you that<br />Park Drive is always jammed.
1717015 1721144 I didn't say Park Drive.
1721228 1723521 I said through the park.
1726275 1729152 Shit! We lost 'em.<br />They're in the park headed south.
1729236 1731571 Get outta here!
1731655 1734031 Fucking prick!
1739496 1742123 I got him, Connie.<br />He's taking the scenic route.
1742207 1744709 - Outta the way!<br />- Oh, man.
1747337 1749797 Get out - Get out of the way.
1754928 1756763 Watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it, watch it!
1756847 1758848 Are you aiming for these people?
1758932 1761058 No. Well, maybe that mime.
1761143 1763478 Whoa!
1763562 1765354 Tree! Tree! Tree!
1767608 1769609 - Whoa!
1769693 1771402 What's goin' on here?
1774030 1775865 Look out! Whoa!
1775949 1779452 Tree! Tree!
1779536 1782079 - Just hang on.<br />- Rock! Rock! Rock!
1785375 1788002 Whoa!
1788086 1791464 Hey, look out!
1791548 1794926 McClane!<br />McClane, watch it.
1799848 1802683 McClane!
1807940 1810441 - Out of the way.<br />- How do Catholics do their thing?
1810526 1814987 - North, south, west, east. How much time?<br />- Twenty-seven minutes.
1815072 1818574 Ha! 72nd and Broadway<br />to Central Park South in three minutes!
1818659 1822161 That's gotta be a fuckin' record.
1822246 1823996 Aw, get out!
1824080 1826374 Yeah.
1826458 1828501 Now what?
1834340 1836759 - We need a fire truck.<br />- What?
1836844 1839136 To follow!
1842140 1846102 - 911.<br />- Lt. John McClane, N.Y.P.D., access number 7479.
1846186 1849522 Calling from a civilian transmitter.<br />Get me an emergency dispatcher right away.
1849606 1851524 Dispatch. Go ahead.
1851608 1854318 I got two officers down at the corner<br />of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue!
1854403 1856320 Need an ambulance! Over!
1856405 1859240 Emergency calls on the west side go to<br />Roosevelt Hospital. That's two blocks from here.
1886435 1888477 Slow the fuck down, McClane!
1888562 1890563 - Kinda like football, isn't it?<br />- What?
1890647 1893566 Get yourself a blocker<br />and head for the end zone!
1895819 1898696 If you'd said Wall Street,<br />we could've followed him all the way.
1898780 1901115 Wrong! South of 14th Street's<br />a different hospital.
1901199 1904160 - Oh.<br />- It's St. Luke's. Hang on.
1912544 1914420 Time?
1914504 1916547 10:02.
1916632 1921177 - We're halfway there with 18 minutes to go.<br />- Fuck this! Hang on.
1935275 1937985 Get out of there!<br />Slide over and take the wheel.
1938070 1940655 - Where you going?<br />- We should be ahead of that train. Right?
1940739 1942698 - You're not gonna get on that train -<br />- I'm gonna get on that train!
1942783 1944700 - You gotta get to that pay phone by 10:20!<br />- What are you gonna do?
1944785 1948037 I'm gonna get that bomb! Listen, you fail,<br />I cover your ass. I fail, you cover my ass.
1948120 1950790 And if we both fail?
1950874 1954961 Then we're both fucked. Go now!<br />Drive! Get to that phone booth by 10:20!
1955045 1958381 - Go!<br />- My lucky fuckin' day.
1961718 1964095 Shit! Look out!<br />Get out!
1966765 1968683 Look out! Look out!
1968767 1971727 Look out! Get out of the way!
1975315 1979110 This is a bad idea!
1979194 1982613 Oh!
1997004 1999255 Whoa!
2005303 2007430 - Excuse me! Excuse me!<br />- Hey!
2007514 2010599 Just get out of the way, please!

2234824 2236742 I'm here.
2236826 2239578 - And McClane?<br />- He's on his way.
2239663 2242248 Uh, you know, he's a little slow.<br />He's kinda out of shape.
2242332 2246961 The rules applied to both of you.<br />I'm afraid this is non-compliance.
2247045 2249964 Good-bye.
2255679 2257680 Trust me, guys.
2259224 2261850 Duck.

2358740 2361367 What -
2365038 2367790 You can see right down into the subway.
2367874 2370209 - How many fire trucks do you count?<br />- You guys! You guys!
2370293 2372252 How can you see it<br />from up here?
2372337 2374713 Damn! Get in there.
2374798 2378467 Officer, tell those people<br />to get the hell back, will ya?
2378550 2381470 We got a shitload of cuts and bruises,<br />a couple concussions ...
2381554 2384390 some old guy's pacemaker stopped,<br />and a pregnant girl's water broke.
2384474 2386642 And that's all.<br />How are you doin', John?
2386726 2389144 I still can't hear too good.
2389229 2391146 Well, it's a miracle<br />you're still alive.
2391230 2393399 - It's a goddamn miracle.<br />- Yeah, that's the problem, Joe.
2393483 2395943 - What?<br />- The miracle part.
2396027 2398654 What are the odds of us<br />making it down here on time?
2398738 2401156 Zip.
2401240 2404660 That bomb was gonna go off no matter what.<br />He wanted it to go off right down here.
2404744 2407204 Take this off me, Dave.
2407288 2409915 Well, what's so special<br />about this place?
2409999 2411917 - I don't know. Something just doesn't add up.<br />- Lt. McClane?
2412000 2415254 - Huh?<br />- They're asking for you and a Mr. Carver.
2415338 2418173 Where?
2418258 2420467 John?
2421636 2425597 John, this is Andy Cross<br />with the FBI
2425682 2427599 This is Mr. Jarvis. He's-
2427684 2430144 I'm, uh, with another agency.
2430228 2434356 - It's good to meet you.<br />- This is Lieutenant McClane. This is Mr. Carver.
2435984 2438944 We got a couple of questions first.
2439028 2441447 Do you recognize this guy?
2443950 2446493 No.
2446578 2448871 How about this one?
2451624 2453750 Mm-mmm.
2453835 2455961 How about you?
2457338 2459965 Did you recognize<br />the voice on the phone?
2460049 2462050 No.
2462135 2466221 Did you notice any cars<br />following you?
2466306 2468849 No.
2468933 2472102 Anybody following you at all?<br />Any kind of surveillance?
2472187 2475272 Telephone? House?<br />Anything unusual at all?
2475356 2478400 Well ...
2478485 2481278 now that you mention it,<br />I have experienced a -
2481362 2483906 you know, like a burning<br />sensation between my toes.
2483990 2487868 I thought it was just some athlete's foot<br />or something. I don't know.
2490079 2493415 We read your jacket, Lieutenant.<br />We were told you would be cooperative.
2493500 2495834 - Cooperate with what?<br />- Hey, now wait a minute. He will be.
2495919 2498337 We're just wasting time here<br />in this goddamn van.
2498420 2501548 You want to share information,<br />how about sending a little our way as well?
2501633 2503509 We wanna hear<br />what he knows first.
2503593 2506178 - What the hell? You give us pictures and then-<br />- We want to hear what he knows.
2506262 2509765 Hey, I know as much<br />as you know. All right?
2509849 2512601 There's a guy out there<br />setting off bombs.
2512685 2516021 He calls himself Simon.<br />He speaks with a German accent.
2516105 2518941 And for some reason,<br />he's very angry with me.
2519025 2522110 Now, maybe you can tell me<br />why, fellas. Huh?
2527408 2530369 The first man there<br />is Methias Targo.
2530453 2533539 Was Hungarian army.<br />Explosives expert.
2533623 2535666 - Now we believe he's working for the Iranians.<br />- Working?
2535750 2538502 Freelance terrorism. By contract.
2539963 2542756 - Who's the girl?<br />- Targo's other half.
2542840 2546510 Rumor is Israelis slipped a bomb in<br />between their sheets. Uh, he wasn't at home...
2546594 2548762 but they think maybe they got her.
2548846 2552891 The second man was an obscure<br />colonel in the East German Army.
2552976 2556937 He ran an infiltration unit. The kind of thing<br />the Nazis did at the Battle of the Bulge.
2557020 2559022 English-speaking troops-
2559107 2561650 Yeah, yeah, I saw the movie.
2561734 2566822 All we know of him is the G.D.R. medical records<br />show he suffers from migraines.
2566906 2569700 His name is Peter Krieg.
2572287 2575747 Well, that is<br />an exceptional report, fellas.
2575832 2578584 Now, do you want to tell me<br />what the hell this has to do with me?
2578668 2581295 The name Gruber mean<br />anything to you, Lieutenant?
2585633 2587968 It rings a bell, yeah.
2588052 2590053 - L.A.<br />- What?
2590138 2592556 That thing in the building in L.A.
2594225 2596268 Peter Krieg ...
2596352 2600355 was born Simon Peter Gruber.
2600440 2604693 He's Hans Gruber's brother.
2607405 2609781 Holy shit.
2609866 2612951 Yeah, it's that thing in L.A.
2613036 2615912 We figure he's got you<br />fitted up for a toe tag ...
2615997 2619082 and he's gonna do anything<br />to get it tied.
2619167 2622169 Inspector!<br />Inspector, it's him.
2624172 2626089 Don't let him know we're here.
2628593 2632304 - Simon.<br />- Inspector.
2632388 2635307 Now, who from the FBI<br />is in the van, I wonder?
2635390 2638560 Let's see. Almost certainly Cross.<br />Come on, Andrew. Say hello.
2638645 2640562 Hello.
2640647 2643815 And I know you never run alone,<br />so say hello, Bill.
2643900 2647069 Still trying to butch up by<br />chewing on your glasses, huh?
2649155 2653992 This, gentlemen, as they say,<br />is where the plot thickens.
2654077 2657704 I have put 2,400 pounds of explosive<br />in one of the 1,446 schools ...
2657789 2659873 in greater New York.
2659957 2664252 It is fitted with a timer set<br />to explode at exactly 3:00 p.m.
2665463 2668090 Thank you.<br />Your silence says I'm understood.
2668174 2670759 Did you say 2,400 pounds?
2670843 2673095 Yes, but please don't interrupt again!
2673179 2676306 Simon says, if you attempt<br />to evacuate schools ...
2676390 2678308 the bomb will be detonated<br />by radio.
2678393 2680560 And, gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.
2680645 2685023 Repeat, one school will be dismissed<br />at 3:00 p.m. permanently, unless -
2685108 2687025 Unless what?
2687110 2689569 Unless John McClane and his new best<br />friend complete the tasks I set them.
2689654 2691321 John, are you listening?
2693990 2698704 - Yeah.<br />- The pay phone beyond<br />Hope, Tompkins Square Park.
2698788 2701540 Twenty minutes.<br />Go by foot. No rush.
2701624 2705794 If you're really clever, you'll  learn the<br />location of the bomb and the code to disarm it.
2705878 2708046 Oh, and by the way, gentlemen ...
2708130 2711216 we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.
2711300 2715971 The only problem is the darn things seem<br />to respond to police and FBI frequencies.
2716055 2719141 So if I were you,<br />I'd keep off your radios.
2719225 2721685 Simon, wait.
2725314 2728400 2,400 pounds<br />of that liquid stuff.
2728484 2731778 My God.<br />Get me the commissioner.
2731863 2734531 He's doing a press conference.<br />He's supposed to be here in half an hour.
2734615 2738076 Ricky, get every senior officer on the site.<br />Get 'em here right away.
2738160 2740912 You're not gonna give me<br />any jurisdictional nonsense on this?
2740997 2745208 I got two kids in the school on 64th Street.<br />What can I do to help you?
2745293 2747461 - How many men have you got?<br />- Seventy-five.
2747545 2750088 But if I push the panic button,<br />I can get 500 from Washington.
2750173 2752591 - When?<br />- 2:30, 3:00.
2752675 2754634 Between now and then -
2754719 2759097 We're gonna have to do this<br />all by ourselves. Let's go.
2759182 2762476 Now, Tompkins Square Park is more than<br />two miles away, so you guys better get running.
2762560 2765145 No radios.<br />You take my telephone.
2765229 2768440 You get anything, you call me through<br />the switchboard. Good luck.
2768524 2771401 Thanks. Find that bomb.
2771486 2774070 - Ricky, where are they?<br />- Right over here.
2774155 2776531 - The senior man present is Chief Allen.<br />- Chief of what?
2776616 2778867 - Transit.<br />- Okay, thanks, Ricky.
2778950 2781828 Gentlemen, we have<br />a decision to make. Chief Allen.
2781913 2784498 The man who has done this<br />has told us ...
2784582 2789586 that he has planted another very large bomb<br />in a school here in the New York area.
2789670 2794049 And he has told us that we cannot evacuate,<br />but he has not said that we cannot search.
2794133 2797135 Now, I recommend we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody -
2797220 2801306 I'm talking about police, transit, sanitation,<br />fire, even the goddamn librarians -
2801390 2805435 and we start searching schools,<br />and I mean right now.
2805520 2808104 I'm talking about 1,000 buildings<br />within the city limits.
2808189 2810816 And we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it in.
2810900 2813819 Now, I'd like to keep the media<br />out of this as long as possible ...
2813903 2816613 because if they get in,<br />we've got a panic.
2816697 2818740 Are we in agreement?
2818825 2821785 Come on, guys! Let's go!
2821869 2824329 Move it out! Move it out!
2824413 2827624 No radio contact.<br />No radio contact.
2836926 2839678 They bought it.
2839762 2841930 You can begin.
2856820 2859114 Hook, line ...
2862285 2864828 and sinker.
2869375 2872002 All right now, men, let's go! Let's go!
2905745 2909205 Sergeant Turley!<br />Sergeant Turley!
2909290 2912250 In the last five minutes, the volume<br />in calls in here has tripled!
2912335 2916171 - What the hell is goin' on?<br />- Stop. Let me explain.
2916255 2919674 For the rest of the day, we're supposed to handle<br />the department's communications.
2919759 2923303 - What do you mean "handle"?<br />- They're shutting down the police band.
2923387 2925889 All calls will be coming<br />through this switchboard.
2925973 2928224 And I'm gonna marry<br />Donald Trump!
2928309 2932312 Walsh, what's going on?<br />Why'd everybody tear out of here?
2932396 2936149 Come on, Pamela. Look at your watch!<br />It's coming up on shift change.
2936233 2938485 The bean counters<br />are worried about overtime ...
2938569 2941321 so we sent everybody<br />back to the precinct to punch out.
2941405 2945116 - The next shift is gonna be here in a minute.<br />- You are so full of shit, Walsh.
2945200 2947410 Thank you.
2954377 2956711 What the hell?
2965763 2968473 Hey! Whoa!<br />Whoa! Whoa!
2968557 2971643 Detective. Bob Thompson.
2971727 2974229 City Engineer's Office.
2974313 2977107 We'd like to get<br />an idea of the damage.
2978859 2982070 Man, you guys<br />really got here fast.
2983280 2986825 Well, it's Wall Street, sir.
2986909 2989369 A lot of money here.
2989453 2993748 A lot of opinion makers the mayor<br />doesn't wanna piss off, you know?
2995835 2998169 Is this it?
3000256 3003258 Holy Toledo!
3003342 3006011 Somebody had fun.
3006095 3010598 I'd appreciate it if you'd show<br />my associates the way down.
3012309 3015186 Yeah. Yeah, sure. Jimmy!
3015270 3019065 You got the flashlight?<br />Murphy, come on! You too!
3019150 3021693 - Rick Walsh.<br />- John Gunther.
3021777 3024070 Come on, gentlemen.<br />Let's go.
3027199 3030577 You were probably at the World Trades.<br />You know what that mess was.
3063360 3067072 Please inform Mr. Little<br />that Mr. Vanderfloog is here.
3067156 3070658 Mr. Vanderfloog?
3070743 3073578 There's a Mr. Vanderfloog for Mr. Little.
3091806 3094766 - A lot of steam down here.<br />- Yeah, yeah. We snapped a<br />couple of the steam pipes.
3094850 3097185 It's like a sauna.
3097269 3099604 - We got the subway guys<br />to shut down the third rail.<br />- Emergency lighting.
3099688 3102398 Yeah, emergency lights,<br />and there's still some light - Hey!
3102483 3104067 No shooting!
3104150 3106277 Speak English!
3106362 3108822 Otto doesn't speak English.<br />Do you, Otto?
3108906 3113326 - Where the hell did we get this guy?<br />- He's one of Targo's thugs.
3113410 3115286 Pull all the way up!
3115370 3117539 Pull all the way!<br />Pull all the way!
3124213 3127132 So what's up with this L.A. thing?<br />You famous or something?
3127216 3129467 Yeah, for<br />about five minutes.
3129552 3132303 - Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?<br />- Fuck you.
3132388 3134806 - You know this guy Simon we were talking to?<br />- Yeah.
3134890 3138685 I threw his little brother off the 32nd floor<br />of the Nakatomi Towers out in L.A.
3138769 3141563 - I guess he's a little pissed off about it.<br />- Wait a minute.
3141647 3144399 You mean to tell me I'm in this shit<br />because some white cop ...
3144483 3146693 threw some white asshole's<br />brother off a roof?
3192198 3194741 Mr. Vanderfloog?<br />Felix Little, Corporate Relations.
3194825 3198286 Sorry you had to wait, but apparently<br />there was an explosion in the subway.
3198370 3201539 - It's played hell with our alarms, I'm afraid.<br />- I trust there's nothing wrong.
3201624 3204500 Oh, no. Good Lord, no.<br />Safe and secure.
3204585 3207545 Now, you were concerned<br />about a currency exchange?
3207630 3210840 We are not a commercial bank,<br />in the normal sense.
3210925 3213635 We're - We're primarily, uh ...
3213719 3216262 governments, central banks,<br />that sort of thing.
3216347 3220058 - Apart from the depository, of course.<br />- Of course.
3220142 3222810 And you are in the flower business,<br />Mr. Vanderfloog?
3226607 3228775 Back! Back! Come on!
3252174 3254509 Come on!
3268649 3271526 Oh, no, Mr. Vanderfloog,<br />that's the vault elevator.
3273153 3276572 I'm sorry.<br />Our alarms are sonic and seismic.
3276657 3279200 Two things which, I'm afraid,<br />do not react well to explosions.
3279285 3283246 You know, this subway business<br />has knocked all our systems into a cocked hat.
3283330 3286416 In fact, we've had to give up<br />and pull the plug on the whole thing.
3286500 3288418 The repair people<br />are downstairs now.
3288502 3290461 - Good Lord!<br />- Yes, yes.
3290546 3293715 Heavens to Betsy if anyone knew!
3296302 3300471 But ...  I thought this was a currency exchange.
3300556 3303975 Oh, I think we'll go<br />straight to the withdrawal.
3307396 3310064 Danke.
3352190 3354859 Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here<br />and take a look at this?
3354943 3357278 Something's going on.
3357363 3360448 - What do you think, guys?<br />You'll be able to fix that?<br />- Just a minute now.
3365037 3367413 - Okay, I'll be right back.<br />- Down!
3372294 3374545 Stay back!
3374630 3377423 Stay back!
3409873 3412291 Come on. Come on! Shit!
3421093 3424095 - Come on!<br />- Front desk.
3424179 3426472 Call the police. Get your ass<br />down here right now! I'm under attack!
3426557 3431018 - Just relax, mate. Maybe you'll live through this.<br />- Shit!
3454293 3457211 I think he's dead, my dear.
3458880 3461257 All right, let's see to<br />the office work.
3505344 3508596 $140 billion!
3510057 3512975 Ten times what's in Kentucky!
3513060 3516812 Fort Knox - ha - is for tourists!
3530452 3532745 Yeah? McClane.
3532829 3536165 John, you're out of shape.<br />You barely made it.
3536250 3539961 Yeah, well, we all barely make it.<br />What do you want us to do?
3540045 3542922 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3543006 3545466 Huh? What -
3545550 3548886 - What'd he say?<br />- What has four legs and is always ready to travel?
3548970 3552431 What's the matter with you?<br />Don't you have kids? That's an elephant joke.
3558230 3560731 Whoa.
3560816 3562733 That a bomb?
3562818 3565861 - Yeah. Go - Go ahead and grab it.<br />- No, you're the cop.
3565946 3568614 - Man, Simon said you're supposed<br />to be helpin' with this.<br />- I'm helpin'.
3568699 3571909 - Well, when are you gonna start helpin'?<br />- After you get the bomb.
3589469 3592346 - Careful.<br />- I'm being careful.
3592430 3596767 - Don't open it.<br />- What? I gotta open it. It's gonna be all right.
3609364 3613034 Shit! Shit!<br />I told you not to open it!
3617706 3619957 I trust you see the message.
3620042 3622543 It has a proximity circuit,<br />so, please, don't run.
3622628 3624795 Yeah, I got it.<br />We're not gonna run.
3624880 3628924 - How do we turn this thing off?<br />- On the fountain, there should be two jugs.
3629009 3632803 Do you see them?<br />A five-gallon and a three-gallon.
3632888 3636974 Fill one of the jugs with exactly<br />four gallons of water.
3637059 3641562 Place it on the scale, and the timer<br />will stop. You must be precise.
3641647 3645191 One ounce or more less<br />will result in detonation.
3645275 3647943 - If you're still alive in five minutes, we'll speak.<br />- Wait! Wait a sec -
3652824 3656243 - I don't get it. You get it?<br />- No.
3657162 3660456 Get the jugs.
3660540 3663417 Obviously, we can't fill the three-gallon jug<br />with four gallons, right?
3663502 3666712 - Obviously.<br />- All right, I know. Here we go.
3666797 3670091 - We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?<br />- Uh-huh.
3670175 3672843 We pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug ...
3672928 3675763 giving us exactly three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug, right?
3675847 3677765 Right. Then what?
3677849 3681268 - Now, take the three-gallon jug, fill that a third -<br />- No, no. He said be precise.
3681353 3683270 - Shit!<br />- Exactly four gallons.
3683355 3686273 Every cop in 50 miles is runnin' his ass off,<br />and I'm playin' kids' games in a park.
3686358 3690903 Hey! You want to focus<br />on the problem at hand?
3707003 3710548 I thought you said you knew!<br />You said don't say anything if you don't know.
3710632 3713050 - Gimme the fuckin' jug. We're<br />startin' over. Pour that out.<br />- We can't start over.
3713135 3715052 - We can't start over. We can't start over.<br />- We're starting over.
3715137 3717596 Gimme the jug or I'm gonna put<br />my foot up your ass, you dumb mother-
3717680 3721225 - Say it! You were gonna call<br />me a nigger, weren't you?<br />- No, I wasn't!
3721309 3724645 - Yes, you were. What were you gonna call me?<br />- Asshole! How's that?
3724730 3728983 Asshole! You got some fuckin' problem with me<br />'cause I'm white, Zeus? Is that it?
3729067 3732069 Have I oppressed you?<br />Have I oppressed your people somehow?
3732154 3735448 - You don't like me 'cause you're a racist!<br />- What?
3735532 3737283 You don't like me<br />'cause I'm white.
3737367 3741245 I don't like you because you're<br />gonna get me killed. How much time?
3741329 3744749 Aw, shit! We got less than a minute.<br />Throw this thing away.
3744833 3748335 We can't take it off of there. It'll detonate.<br />Wait a second. Wait a second.
3750422 3753090 - I got it! Exactly two gallons in here, right?<br />- Right.
3753175 3755843 - Leaving exactly one gallon of empty space, right?<br />- Yeah.
3755927 3759805 A full five gallons here. Pour one gallon out<br />of the five gallons into there, we have -
3759890 3762141 - Exactly four gallons!<br />- Yes!
3762225 3764643 Pour it in there. Come on.<br />Come on!
3765812 3767772 Don't spill it.<br />Don't spill it!
3767856 3771275 - Good, good, good. Exactly four gallons.<br />- You did it, McClane.
3771359 3773778 - Put it on the thing! Get it down there!<br />- Oh, shit
3781703 3784538 Congratulations.<br />You're still alive.
3784623 3787291 - Huh?<br />- Congratulations.
3787375 3790920 - Yeah, we did it.<br />- You surprise me again, John.
3791004 3792922 This is becoming an ugly habit.
3793006 3795758 Yeah, well, I don't have the time<br />right now, Simon. Listen.
3795842 3798594 Deal's a deal.<br />Where's the school bomb?
3798678 3801847 On the contrary,<br />you have lots of time.
3801932 3804225 You have ...
3804309 3807353 two hours and 47 minutes precisely.
3807437 3810898 - Plenty of time to test those wits of yours.<br />- Hey! Hey!
3810982 3815152 Hey, listen, jerk-off? Let me tell you somethin'.<br />I got a bad fuckin' hangover!
3815237 3818405 And I'm a little sick of these fuckin' riddles!<br />Now, where is the school bomb?
3818490 3822618 Temper, John.<br />The road to truth has many turns.
3822702 3826163 You will find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3826248 3830543 When you undertake the trip it suggests,<br />ask yourself this question:
3830627 3834255 What is 21 out of 42?
3836299 3839426 We're behind.<br />We should abandon the rest and go.
3839510 3842054 Relax, Targo.<br />There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3842138 3846725 He's sending us to the home team dugout<br />at Yankee Stadium. Why?
3846810 3849562 Well, we're the home team.<br />Are we supposed to find something there?
3849646 3854817 - What's 21 out of 42?<br />- Twenty-one again. Half of 42. Forty-two what?
3854900 3857903 - How many players are on the Yankees ball club?<br />- Twenty-five.
3857988 3861532 - What else is 21? Black Jack.<br />- It's a club.
3861616 3864243 It's a wild-goose chase<br />is what it is.
3868290 3870624 Where's the nearest "A" train?
3870709 3874461 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br />You know, some kid might find that.
3876464 3878883 You're right.
3882637 3886473 Come back here!<br />You little sons of bitches!
3886558 3889101 Hey, you!<br />I remember you!
3890896 3893397 Hey, hey, where are you going?<br />Come here. What are ya doin'?
3893480 3895858 - Let me go, dick-head.<br />- Watch your mouth.
3895942 3899904 You wanna go down to juvenile hall<br />for a Butterfinger, is that it?
3899988 3902740 Look around, man.<br />All the cops are into somethin'.
3902824 3904867 It's Christmas.<br />You could steal city hall!
3912208 3914752 - Come on! Let's go. Come on!<br />- My bike!
3914836 3917087 - That's my bike!<br />- Yeah, it's Christmas!
3917172 3920841 - Hey, hey, where are ya going?<br />Yankee Stadium's that way.<br />- That's my bike, you asshole!
3927349 3930142 Why don't ya just run over<br />everybody in the whole street?
3930226 3933020 McClane, what the fuck<br />are we doing back down here?
3933104 3935940 Let me ask you somethin'.<br />What is it that Wall Street doesn't have?
3936024 3938108 What, is this stuff-catchin'?<br />You're talkin' in riddles.
3938193 3942237 No, no, stay with me! What is it<br />that Wall Street does not have? Schools.
3942322 3946075 - And what is it they have a shitload of?<br />- What?
3952582 3954792 I'll be back in a minute.
3954876 3957753 What am I supposed to do<br />with this?
3957837 3960339 Give it to those guys over there.
3960423 3963842 - He's here.<br />- Perhaps you could be a little more specific.
3963927 3968514 McClane is here.<br />He's walking toward the bank.
3968598 3971809 And the black man<br />is coming toward me.
3971893 3977398 Oh, no, that's a pity. And after we've gone<br />to all that trouble at the stadium.
3977482 3979608 Simon, kill him.
3979693 3983445 Stop toying with him<br />and kill him now.
3983530 3985656 Okay, so be it.
3985740 3990786 May he rest in peace.<br />I'll inform Karl in the lobby.
3990870 3993789 - You pack up your team and get out of there.<br />- And this one?
3993873 3995541 Officer.
3998920 4001755 Yeah, I'm afraid I'm gonna need<br />an answer on that issue.
4007053 4010723 - Let him go.<br />- Understood. Yes, sir?
4010807 4014518 John McClane says to give you this.
4014602 4017563 Wait, wait! Jesus!<br />Don't open it. It's a bomb.
4017647 4019314 - Another?<br />- Yeah?
4019399 4023068 Oh! I see. Um, we'll take care of that.<br />We better move now.
4023153 4028574 Sir, thank you so much for your assistance.<br />We really appreciate it. Thank you.
4047719 4051013 Hey! You - You leavin'<br />this place unguarded?
4072160 4074661 - How ya doin'?<br />- All right.
4074746 4077414 John McClane, N.Y.P.D.
4077499 4079500 Are ya all right?
4079584 4082211 Yeah.<br />It's ...  laundry day.
4083338 4085672 What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
4085757 4088258 Has it been quiet like this<br />all morning here?
4088343 4091720 - Well -<br />- Except for that big explosion<br />a couple of hours ago.
4091805 4095766 - Have you seen anything strange<br />happen in the last hour or so?<br />- No.
4095850 4100145 - We've had cops in here pretty<br />steady since the subway thing.<br />- Yeah, right.
4100230 4103774 We were just gonna make a round<br />on the vault floor if you wanna tag along.
4103858 4106110 Sure, yeah.<br />I think I will.
4106194 4110072 - What do you think of this<br />heat this late in the year?<br />- Indian summer, huh?
4110156 4115119 Yeah, it feels like it's gonna rain like dogs<br />and cats later. Here's one of your guys.
4115203 4118122 Detective, uh, Otto,<br />isn't it?
4118206 4120165 John McClane.
4122544 4124503 Mike, how ya doin'?
4126880 4130717 I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna take the stairs<br />just for the exercise.
4130802 4135848 And on a hot day like this- But it seems like<br />I always end up riding the lift.
4162709 4165794 Hey, what was the lottery<br />number last night? Huh?
4165879 4168297 You guys play<br />the lottery? No?
4168380 4171133 Uh, my wife buys me<br />two tickets every week.
4171217 4173635 For the last 10 years, plays the same<br />two numbers all the time.
4173720 4176305 I said, "Honey, why don't<br />you play a different number?"
4176389 4179725 She says, "Well, those are my lucky numbers."<br />I got the tickets right here.
4182937 4187232 Put that fuckin' gun down!<br />Put the fuckin' gun down now!
4191404 4194907 Put it down!
4200288 4202414 Hello?
4202498 4204666 Anybody down here?
4213843 4217012 Put your hands up!<br />Put your fuckin' hands up now!
4217096 4219765 No, John!<br />No, no, God, it's me!
4221850 4224770 - Jesus Christ, you almost gave me a heart attack.<br />- You all right?
4224854 4226688 - Huh?<br />- You all right?
4226773 4229316 - Yeah, yeah, it's not my blood.<br />- What the hell's goin' on down here?
4229400 4232319 Go take a look in there.
4254175 4257761 Hey, McClane.<br />Where the hell is everybody?
4257845 4261265 Simon "fuckin"' says!
4261349 4264601 I should've seen it comin' a mile away.<br />This was never about revenge.
4264686 4267854 - It's about a goddamn heist.<br />- What was in the room?
4267939 4269815 This.
4269899 4273402 What is this? Oh, shit!<br />Is this gold?
4273486 4277114 - Yeah, it's gold.<br />- This is heavy! They cleaned<br />out a whole room of this?
4277198 4281451 - Yeah.<br />- You know, that would've taken<br />like a-a tank or a, uh, uh-
4281536 4283620 A dump truck.
4283705 4285622 Fourteen great big<br />dump trucks.
4285707 4287833 - We almost got hit by a dump truck.<br />- Shit!
4287917 4290210 Damn! Slow down! Shit!
4290295 4292254 - Put that shit down.<br />- No fuckin' way.
4292338 4294298 - They ain't gonna let you keep it.<br />- Yeah, yeah, we'll see.
4294382 4296341 - We're gonna need a car.<br />- A car?
4302515 4304808 - You know how to hot-wire this thing?<br />- Of course I can.
4304892 4308478 I'm an electrician.<br />Only problem is -
4311899 4313859 Takes too fuckin' long.
4326289 4330751 - They're not on the bridge.<br />- Down there, McClane. The F.D.R.
4333212 4335630 Let's go, let's go!<br />Come on!
4335715 4337674 Aw, shit!
4337759 4340510 - What?<br />- They shot the phone.
4340595 4343305 Aw, too bad. Come on.<br />What's 21 out of 42?
4343389 4345932 - I don't have a clue.<br />- What about Yankee Stadium?
4346017 4349061 We'll get there. But that son of a bitch<br />is not gettin' off on Manhattan!
4349145 4352981 Jesus Christ! Who do you think<br />you are, lady, Hillary Clinton?
4353066 4355650 That's it! Hillary Clinton!<br />The 42nd president.
4355735 4359988 - She'd be the 43rd president.<br />- All right. Who's the 21st?
4360073 4361990 - I don't know.<br />- You don't know?
4362075 4364368 - No, I don't know. Do you know?<br />- No!
4364452 4367954 Well? What kinda engine does this piece<br />of shit have? Step on it!
4368039 4371124 It's a Yugo. It's built for economy,<br />not speed.
4372960 4376213 - Whoa! What are ya doin'?<br />- I'm gonna get us another phone.
4379926 4383470 Wait, wait, wait. Hey!<br />Who was the 21st president?
4383554 4385639 Go fuck yourself!
4387266 4391103 - That guy was pissed.<br />- He'll feel better when he looks in the backseat.
4391187 4395941 - Oh, shit, that was my gold bar!<br />- This is McClane. Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.
4396025 4398693 - John, where the hell are you?<br />- Walter, it's not a revenge. It's a heist.
4398778 4401321 - What?<br />- There's gold in the Federal Reserve ...
4401406 4403698 and they took a shitload of it.
4403783 4406326 - They're headed north in dump trucks.<br />- Have you been drinking?
4406410 4408912 No, not since this morning.
4408996 4411748 Listen, there's a line of dump trucks<br />northbound on the F.D.R. at about 70th.
4411833 4414501 You gotta close the bridge and get<br />some helicopters over there right away.
4414585 4417254 I couldn't close<br />a hot dog stand right now.
4417338 4420257 I'm spread all over hell.<br />What about this damn bomb?
4420340 4422551 Find out who the 21st president was.<br />It's got something to do with this.
4422635 4424469 John! John, the 21st what?
4424554 4428557 Walter? Shit!<br />Goddamn cellular fuckin' phones!
4428640 4430600 - Get hold of Munson in Triborough.<br />- Inspector.
4430685 4433645 Tell him to close all the East River bridges<br />north of 59th street.
4433729 4435939 - Lookin' for dump trucks.<br />- Dump trucks?
4436023 4439860 McClane says there are dump trucks headed<br />up the F.D.R. loaded with gold.
4439944 4442988 Walter, they don't allow<br />dump trucks on the F.D.R.!
4443072 4445490 - Connie!<br />- All right! You don't want I should argue ...
4445575 4448034 I won't argue,<br />no matter how stupid it is.
4448119 4451413 K-9, bring it around to the back.<br />Check out the boiler room.
4451497 4453415 Find anything, Charlie?
4453499 4456960 I could spend a week in here<br />with an X-ray machine and still not find it.
4457044 4460422 You don't have a week. You got five more<br />minutes, then we're movin' up to 86th street.
4460506 4462466 We're goin'<br />as fast as we can.
4462550 4464468 What's up?
4464552 4467554 McClane was mentioning something<br />about the Federal Reserve Building.
4467638 4471266 - Isn't that right near that<br />Wall Street bomb site we just left?<br />- Yeah.
4476397 4479774 How long do you want us to stay here?
4479859 4482444 The men at the stadium,<br />stay or go?
4482528 4485071 Karl should have checked in by now.
4485156 4487073 Moment.
4493247 4497667 Come on, come on.
4497752 4500879 Stay where you are.<br />McClane may still turn up.
4500963 4503632 Relax, Targo.<br />If he is still alive ...
4503716 4507677 he won't be talking to anyone.
4507762 4509721 It's the next turn-off.
4509805 4513475 Hi, it's Elvis Duran.<br />You're on the air. What's up?
4513559 4516853 First of all, I just wanna tell you<br />what a great show you got.
4516938 4519773 - I listen to you all the time.<br />- Thank you. What do you wanna talk about?
4519857 4523818 You know all those cop cars screaming around<br />everywhere? You know what they're up to?
4523903 4528323 There's a bomb in a school.<br />My cousin's a cop.
4528407 4531201 - Here you go, my dear.<br />- Somebody put a big<br />bomb in a school somewhere.
4531285 4533328 Only they don't know<br />which one.
4533412 4536039 So they're searching all of them.
4536123 4538959 - Shh.<br />- Every school in the metropolitan area.
4539043 4541336 Holy shit!
4541420 4544506 - Doris, can you get a hold of my wife?<br />- Annie?
4544590 4549636 Turley! Half the goddamn<br />city just called 911!

4618372 4622917 See? It goes from here all the<br />way out to the Catskill Mountains.
4623002 4627714 - What does?<br />- That! The water pipe! Goes for about 60 miles!
4634055 4635972 - Hey, you the foreman?<br />- Yeah.
4636057 4640685 N.Y.P.D. You had any extra dump trucks come<br />through here in the last couple of minutes?
4640770 4642687 I'm gonna write<br />those fuckin' clowns up.
4642772 4645065 They better start payin' attention to work orders,<br />or I'm gonna kick some butt.
4645149 4649402 - Who you talkin' about?<br />- The dozen idiots who tore ass up the tube!
4649487 4651446 We're not loadin' up there.<br />We're loadin' over here!
4651530 4653990 So much for bridges<br />and helicopters.
4654075 4658161 - You got a map showin' me where this tunnel goes?<br />- Yeah, right here.
4659914 4663583 We run pretty much up under the Saw Mill<br />until you get up to the Coffer Dam.
4663668 4666378 From there on, we've already brought<br />the water down from the reservoir.
4666462 4670799 - Anybody get in or outta there?<br />- Yeah. There's a vent shaft every two miles.
4670883 4674552 - No, I mean with a truck?<br />- At the Coffer Dam. You can get a truck in there.
4674637 4678348 You can get there on the surface.<br />Follow Saw Mill River Parkway. It's about 20 miles.
4678432 4682060 - I'm gonna meet you right there, all right?<br />- What am I supposed to do?
4682144 4685230 - You're gonna go up to Yankee Stadium.<br />- McClane.
4685314 4688983 - Go! Get outta here! We got less than two hours.<br />- Goddamn it!
4694532 4696449 Hey! Is somethin' wrong?
4696534 4701579 480 yards of rock moved so far.<br />Now, that's 10 times the Hoover Dam.
4701664 4706042 Right now, there's 516 feet<br />of rock above our heads.
4706127 4708878 This part is phase three<br />of tunnel three.
4708963 4711798 Planning for it<br />began back in 1954 ...
4711882 4714718 but construction didn't begin<br />till June of 1970.
4714802 4717512 You know what the most interesting part<br />of tunnel three is?
4717596 4719806 - What's that, Jerry?<br />- The valves. Each one-
4726564 4730275 A big departure from tunnels one and two.
4730359 4734779 Come on!<br />What a hell of a place to break down.
4734864 4737198 Hold it a minute, Jerry.<br />Let me have your hard hat.
4737283 4739909 - You got a jacket?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah, here.

4765019 4768813 Cute little red-and-white suit.<br />I'm surprised you didn't see him.
4771358 4774694 What is it with you guys<br />and these phones?
4774779 4777280 This'll gimme somethin'.
4777364 4780700 Holy shit! ls that guy dead?

4784288 4788124 Yeah. I want you to get<br />ahold of a guy named Cobb.
4788209 4792003 Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.<br />He's the head of my police unit.
4792087 4795757 Get him down here. Find him.<br />Tell him you were with John McClane.
4795840 4799594 - Tell him to find out who the 21st president was.<br />- Chester A. Arthur.
4799678 4802347 - What?<br />- Chester A. Arthur.
4802430 4806518 1881 to 1885.<br />Nominated Vice President in 1880.
4806602 4809896 Did you know he was collector of customs<br />right here in New York?
4809980 4813983 No, I didn't know that, Jerry.<br />Take care of yourself.
4877506 4880675 TV's got us. TV's got us.<br />We gotta release these traffic guys.
4880759 4882760 No, traffic jams<br />we can take care of later.
4882845 4885555 - You find out what the hell<br />is wrong with this thing!<br />- The frequencies are jammed.
4885639 4887724 - What about Ricky?<br />- I don't know. I can't get ahold of him.
4887808 4890351 - But, Walter, Federal Reserve.<br />- Yeah?

4909330 4913666 In half an hour, you're gonna have a riot<br />at every school in this city.
4918880 4922425 We'll start at the top floor.<br />Put 20 men on each floor.
4922509 4924928 Send the other 50 men<br />down to the basement with us.
4925012 4927805 - What about McClane?<br />- Not a word. I'm getting nothing but busy signals.
4927890 4929891 Westchester's probably<br />worse than we are.
4929975 4932769 This is kinda puttin' all our eggs in one basket.<br />What if McClane's wrong?
4932853 4934312 - Walter.<br />- Yeah?
4934396 4936898 This is Principal Martinez.<br />Principal Martinez, Inspector Cobb.
4936982 4939317 - How do you do, Inspector?<br />- How do you do, Principal Martinez?
4939400 4941361 I don't want to alarm<br />your children.
4941445 4943863 I wonder if you could move them<br />all into the auditorium and keep them calm.
4961799 4965718 We are coming to the dam.<br />You can call the rear guard.
4970933 4974936 Rear guard,<br />you can close up now.
4975020 4979816 We've reached the dam.<br />You can come up now. Nils?
4979900 4983861 You can close in now! Nils!
4983946 4986489 Attention! Attention!<br />Nils is dead.
4986573 4990493 I repeat, Nils is dead,<br />fuck-head. So's his pal.
4990577 4994414 And those four guys from the East German<br />All-Stars, your boys down at the bank ...
4994498 4997000 they're gonna be a little late.
4997084 4999377 John.
4999460 5004757 In the back of the truck you're driving,<br />there's $13 billion worth in gold bullion.
5004842 5008428 - I wonder, would a deal be out of the question?<br />- Yeah, I got a deal for you.
5008512 5012265 Crawl out from under that rock you're hiding<br />under and I'll drive this truck up your ass.
5012349 5014809 How colorful.
5021275 5025445 - I told you not to toy with him!<br />- Thank you. That's very helpful.
5028782 5031701 You've jeopardized the mission<br />and the contract!
5034120 5038791 We are vuInerable till we reach the ship.<br />I'm going to put an end to this.

5051847 5053765 We drown him.
5065194 5067111 Walter!
5067196 5072116 Take a look at this. Janitor said this one was<br />delivered this morning. About 10:30, right?
5072200 5075244 - Not hooked up.<br />- Yeah?
5075329 5077997 Okay. Now, take a look<br />at the front.
5079625 5082627 We drill the hinges.<br />Get everybody out.
5233445 5237365 McClane!
5237449 5239408 - McClane!<br />- Where are ya?
5239493 5244372 Over here! You got a hell of a way<br />off laggin' somebody down! You all right?
5244456 5247166 - Did you go to Yankee Stadium?<br />- Yeah. There's nobody there.
5247250 5249418 - You didn't see nobody?<br />- No!

5256050 5260012 "Oh, no, I didn't see nobody.<br />Nobody's following us." Go, go, go!
5264393 5267270 It's not rigged.<br />Pull it.
5278240 5282034 Well, I'd say you could call off<br />your search.
5282119 5284787 - Can you stop it?<br />- I shouldn't even touch it.
5284870 5288958 Who knows what kind of booby traps this<br />thing's got. What about the code?
5289042 5291419 - No word.<br />- When do we evacuate?
5291503 5294922 - Simon says he sees one kid<br />leave the building, boom!<br />- Fine, there's a chance ...
5295007 5298467 that somebody's watchin', but we can't<br />stand here with our thumb up our ass ...

5371290 5374377 Mr. Lambert here is<br />from the fire department ...
5374460 5378839 and today he wants us to<br />practice a brand-new fire drill.
5378924 5382468 So, I want you to divide in half,<br />and I want half of you to go over here -
5382552 5385846 - teachers will help them -<br />and line up against the wall.<br />- Open the door.

5390977 5394021 All right? Everybody up, please.<br />Teachers, please help them.
5394106 5397733 Fire drill, my ass!<br />That guy ain't from the fire department.
5397818 5402613 - Maybe it's 'cause of the radio.<br />- You mean like they're after us? Nah.
5402697 5406033 - Tony squealed on us.<br />- No, he didn't.
5406118 5409537 - Come on!<br />- Well, where you going?
5412249 5416335 Let me drive! Let me drive!<br />Goddamn it!
5416420 5419338 Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
5419423 5422258 - Of course he put the bomb up in that school.<br />- Why would he do that?
5422342 5426846 Make sure he got your complete attention!
5428473 5430599 - Jesus! Jesus!<br />- Find the fuse panel!
5430684 5433144 - What?<br />- The fuse panel! Where's the fuse panel to this car?
5433228 5435771 - It's right here! Right here!<br />- Pull out the anti-lock brakes fuse.
5435856 5439066 - Shit, I don't know which one it is.<br />- Well, then yank 'em all out.
5439150 5442862 - There.<br />- Put your head fuckin' down.<br />This is gonna be really bad.
5442946 5446657 Listen to me. Hang the fuck on, all right?
5473018 5475436 Oh, what the fuck happened?
5475520 5478022 You got a "Triple A" card?
5478106 5480483 - Keep moving. Keep moving.<br />- Excuse me.
5480567 5482860 I got the janitors making a last sweep<br />of the building right now.
5482944 5484945 Thank you, Ms. Martinez.
5502255 5504173 Come on.
5507719 5510095 Stay down!<br />Stay low!
5519356 5521273 Oh, man!
5523902 5526195 - What the fuck are you doin'?<br />- Interrogatin' him.
5526279 5528280 What's he gonna tell you,<br />"I'm dead"?
5528365 5530282 I ain't gonna know till I ask him.
5530367 5533327 Go around and see if there's<br />any aspirins in that glove box.
5533410 5535663 No way. You do it.
5542170 5546674 Ten quarters. The guy in the dump truck<br />had 10 quarters.
5546758 5550344 - Exactly ten quarters.<br />- Well, maybe they were making<br />long-distance phone calls.
5550428 5553097 No. It's for the bridge.
5553180 5555474 - What?<br />- It's for the toll on the bridge.
5557560 5559895 There, there! Down on the wharf!
5559980 5562815 Dump trucks!<br />Right there! Right there!
5562899 5567069 Christ, they got it loaded on a ship already.
5568780 5570948 Shit! How 'bout the Coast Guard?
5571032 5573200 It'd take 'em an hour to get here.<br />- Shit!
5573285 5575286 Shit!
5575370 5577413 - We can jump.<br />- What?
5577497 5580332 - We can jump.<br />- Outta your fuckin' mind?<br />It's 100 feet down to the deck!
5580417 5584587 - But not to the crane it isn't.<br />- The cables would cut you in half.
5584670 5586630 - I can make it.<br />- Bullshit. Get down.
5586715 5589800 Get down. Look in the back of<br />that car for some gloves.
5592720 5595931 Six booby traps, four dead ends -
5603273 5607318 Okay, honey, let's dance.
5607402 5611488 We're gonna have sort of a race.<br />So when I say go, I want you all to run like crazy.
5611573 5615618 All of you follow the police officer and<br />the fireman. You guys are my front runners.
5615702 5618120 Walter, I think we're<br />cuttin' this a little thin.
5618204 5621665 No, Joe, we're gonna wait.<br />McClane still may get the code.
5623960 5627129 - Line me up with that crane!<br />- There, there, right there.
5627213 5630507 - Right there. You're okay.<br />- All right, I see it now.
5630592 5634303 - Shit, this is gonna take a miracle. Swing it.<br />- Keep your fingers crossed.
5634387 5636513 Okay, come on, come on.<br />You almost got it.
5636598 5638849 Almost, almost.<br />Yeah, all right!
5638933 5641101 Where you goin'?<br />You in a hurry?
5641186 5643187 I'm goin' first this time,<br />all right?
5644898 5647483 We have the intercom rigged, sir.
5647567 5651779 Walter, the kids may be fine, but you wait<br />much longer, and I'm gonna pee in my pants.
5651863 5654907 We're gonna wait, Connie.
5654990 5656992 Six more minutes.
5671383 5673384 - Yo, McClane. Down there.<br />- What?
5683812 5686939 Oh, shit!<br />Go, go. Go, man! Go, go, go!
5712757 5715342 Oh, boy ...
5715427 5718303 am I glad you talked me<br />outta jumpin'.
5744414 5746874 Fuck.
5746958 5749501 Get his feet.
5787874 5789833 We go find Simon ...
5789918 5793045 and drag him to the ship-to-shore radio<br />and beat that fuckin' code out of him.
5793129 5794922 Here, take this.
5795006 5797341 - How does it work?<br />- You don't know how to shoot a gun?
5797425 5799885 Look, all brothers don't know how<br />to shoot guns, you racist motherfucker.
5799969 5803722 Sue me. Just yank back on that<br />and pull the trigger.
5803807 5805724 - That's it.<br />- That's it?
5805809 5807810 That's it.<br />Just don't shoot yourself.
5807894 5811063 Hey, don't be no hero.<br />You find him, you come get me.
5827622 5830165 Hey, Katya!
5838049 5840717 Stupid. Stupid!
5881426 5883552 You have the autopilot set?
5883636 5886138 - Yes, sir.<br />- Good.
5891394 5893478 Don't fuckin' move.
5899777 5901862 Oh, the Samaritan.
5901946 5906742 - Gimme the goddamn code.<br />- Code? Oh!
5906826 5910203 You mean for the school?<br />I'm sorry, I can't do that.
5910288 5914207 You call in that code right now<br />or I blow your sick ass ...
5914292 5916960 into the next world.
5917045 5919046 If that's what<br />you gotta do.
5930350 5933268 You gotta take the safety catch off.
5933353 5935854 Oh, goddamn!
5935939 5939066 - See, that works. Now, where's McClane?<br />- Shit!
5956459 5958377 What was that?
5962215 5964341 He said, "Don't shoot."
5964425 5968512 Charlie, we're gonna<br />have to go with the evacuation.

6032452 6035829 Going to arrest me, "bunny"?
6035913 6040042 No. I don't think<br />I'm gonna arrest you.
6040960 6043253 I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.
6053556 6057476 - I knew it was bullshit. There's nobody watching.<br />- Time to get Charlie out.
6057560 6059853 Let's move, Charles.<br />Time's up.
6059937 6063315 - Give me another 30 seconds.<br />- It takes a minute - 15 if you're a kid, Charlie.
6063399 6066985 And last I looked, you weren't too light<br />on your feet. Now move!

6196157 6200285 - Shit, it's too far!<br />- Over here. Down.
6205540 6207709 No guts, no glory.
6207793 6210462 There's a big black-and-white<br />fuckin' boat in the middle of the harbor.
6210546 6214257 - Stay on the line.<br />- Yeah, sure, I'll stay on the line.
6230524 6232859 Pancake syrup?
6232944 6236821 Stupid. Stupid. Asshole.
6237865 6240075 Hello, John McClane.
6240159 6243578 There was never any bomb<br />in the school, was there?
6243663 6246331 Of course not.
6246415 6251753 I'm a soldier, not a monster.<br />Even though I sometimes work for monsters.
6251837 6256132 No. The real bomb<br />is on this ship.
6259512 6262097 Coast Guard.
6262180 6264599 I was tellin' 'em<br />where the boat was.
6264684 6267102 Game over, huh?
6267186 6270188 Not quite over.
6270273 6273608 Bridgeport Coast Guard,<br />come in, please.
6273693 6278363 - They put you on hold?<br />- She told me to stay on the line.
6280740 6284536 Oh, God, I love this country.
6284620 6288290 You know,<br />your brother was an asshole.
6288374 6291793 - He really was an asshole.<br />- He was - He was an asshole.
6291877 6295255 You got his number, yeah.<br />Yeah, okay.
6297383 6301845 Forgive me.<br />Would you help Mr. McClane below?
6301929 6304723 Careful now.
6306058 6309686 Now, do you have<br />the communiqué?
6309770 6312814 - Bridgeport Radio. Come in, please, Bridgeport.<br />- Coast Guard.
6312898 6314816 - Are you there, dear?<br />- Yes, we're here.
6314900 6318153 - Do you have the ability to record a message?<br />- Yes.
6318237 6321364 - Then please begin now.<br />- All right.
6326412 6329622 This is a communiqué from the C.R.F.
6329707 6333460 For too long, the West has conspired<br />to steal the wealth of the world ...
6333544 6336671 consigning the balance of humanity<br />to economic starvation.
6336756 6339966 Today, we will level<br />the playing field.
6340050 6343094 In a few minutes, the contents<br />of the Federal Reserve Bank ...
6343179 6346348 the gold your economies<br />are built of ...
6346432 6351102 will be redistributed by explosive across<br />the bottom of the Long Island Sound.
6352646 6356274 If you are not in gridlock,<br />I invite you to come and watch.
6361155 6364240 - You're gonna blow it all up?<br />- That's the idea.
6364325 6366743 There are some gentlemen<br />in the Middle East who seem to think ...
6366827 6369204 that they'll make<br />a great deal of money.
6369288 6374042 See the men safely off the ship,<br />and I'll see you in the port-side launch.
6374126 6378088 What the hell's all this<br />got to do with killin' McClane?
6378172 6380173 Life has its little bonuses.
6380257 6383259 Didn't I hear you say you<br />didn't even like your brother?
6383344 6386096 There's a difference between not liking<br />one's brother and not caring ...
6386180 6388848 when some dumb Irish flatfoot<br />drops him out of a window.
6388933 6390975 Hey, I didn't even know<br />that motherfucker!
6391060 6393144 Yes, and I never invited you<br />aboard the ship.
6393229 6395146 No riddle is gonna stop this motherfucker?
6395230 6398525 No code, no riddle,<br />no fancy little countdown.
6398609 6401861 Hey, fuck-head.<br />Yeah, you, fuck-head.
6403489 6406074 There's just one thing<br />I gotta know.
6406158 6408743 You got any aspirins?
6408828 6411830 I've had a bad fuckin'<br />headache all day long.
6412957 6416418 Must be your lucky day.
6416502 6420463 Keep the bottle.
6431725 6434978 Where is the gold?
6435062 6438189 He's betrayed us.
6438274 6441025 The containers are filled with that.
6473559 6476394 If I hadn't have saved your fuckin' ass,<br />I wouldn't be sittin' here with you ...
6476479 6478730 about to blow up with<br />$100 billion in fuckin' gold!
6478814 6481149 Yeah, well, I got some bad news.<br />You're only gonna blow up with me.
6481233 6483485 - What?<br />- There's no gold on this boat.
6483569 6486154 - How do you know that?<br />- 'Cause I know the man, I know the family.
6486238 6488823 The only thing better than blowin' up<br />$100 billion worth of gold ...
6488908 6490992 is makin' people<br />think you did.
6491076 6494329 - Well, where is it?<br />- He must've have switched it<br />back on the dock somewhere.
6494413 6497499 - Oh, yeah. That's supposed<br />to make me feel better?<br />- No.
6497583 6499792 You're wrong about the other thing, though.<br />You're not gonna die.
6499877 6502795 You know some cop trick about handcuffs<br />that's gonna get us outta this?
6502880 6505131 Yeah, use a key.
6505216 6508134 - You know how to pick this lock?<br />- Is this some black shit again?
6508219 6511137 Will you stop with that racial shit?<br />Are you a fuckin' locksmith or not?
6511222 6514516 - Yeah, yeah, I can do it if<br />I had somethin' to do it with.<br />- How 'bout a splinter ...
6514600 6517685 - of that cable I slid down?<br />- That might work.
6517770 6521981 - Hold on.<br />- What the fuck are you doin'?
6525110 6527904 Oh, fuck! Shit!
6527988 6531366 - How's that? That big enough?<br />- Shit, yeah, that might work.
6531450 6534702 All right, then I'm gonna<br />drop it in your hands. Cup your hand.
6534787 6537789 - Don't drop this motherfucker, all right?<br />- Get - All right, come on.
6537873 6539791 - Ya ready? Ready?<br />- One ...
6539875 6541709 two - Spit it.
6541794 6545213 - Yeah! Come on, come on. Move your hands.<br />- Get it?
6545297 6548174 All right, okay.
6548259 6552262 - Damn, McClane, you know,<br />I was just startin' to like you.<br />- Well, don't. I'm an asshole.
6552346 6554389 What are you<br />talkin' about now?
6554473 6557350 - I lied to you, Zeus.<br />- About what?
6557434 6561437 - Remember I said Weiss found<br />that bomb up in Harlem?<br />- Yeah.
6561522 6565066 - They found it in Chinatown.<br />- Now that's low, even for<br />a white motherfucker like you.
6565150 6567652 I told you<br />I was an asshole.
6567736 6570154 What the fuck was that?
6570239 6572865 I don't know.
6572950 6575827 - It was the only way I could<br />get you to come with me.<br />- Uh-huh.
6575910 6577829 - You got a wife, McClane?<br />- Yeah.
6577913 6580832 I'm surprised anybody would<br />stay with you long enough to be married.
6580916 6583626 Well, she didn't stick around too long.<br />We're sort of separated.
6583710 6585628 What the fuck is<br />"sort of separated"?
6585713 6588298 Well, she was in L.A.,<br />I was in New York.
6588382 6592176 We had a fight on the phone,<br />she hung up. I didn't call her back.
6592260 6595763 - How long ago was that?<br />- About a year ago now.
6595848 6599100 A year -
6599184 6602228 What the fuck you laughin' about?
6602313 6605648 You threw away your marriage because you were<br />too fuckin' stupid to pick up the phone?
6605733 6608234 What, you think that's funny, huh?<br />You laugh at other people's misfortunes?
6608319 6610445 I bet you blame that shit<br />on your wife, too, right?
6610529 6615408 My wife is a very stubborn woman. Yes!
6615492 6619662 - You better stop fuckin'<br />laughin' and undo these cuffs!<br />- I'm almost there!
6619747 6622749 How's that for concentration?<br />Aw, shit!
6622833 6625460 - What?<br />- Fuck! I dropped the thing!
6625544 6627837 - You dropped the fuckin' thing?<br />- Goddamn it!
6627920 6630465 - Oh, shit! Where did it go?<br />- Find it, all right?
6630549 6632550 I don't fuckin' see it.
6632635 6635053 What the fuck is that?
6635137 6638014 I think I made it mad.
6638098 6642185 - Just go, McClane. Get the fuck outta here!<br />- I gotta fuckin' do somethin'.
6642269 6645480 Goddamn it, McClane!<br />Listen to me!
6645564 6647982 Just go.
6648067 6652153 Have a hard enough time gettin' through the day<br />without havin' your death on my conscience.
6652237 6654697 - Shut the fuck up and think, all right?<br />- Tools. Check the engine room.
6654782 6657033 There's no time!
6657117 6659410 - What the hell's it doin' now?<br />- It's mixin'.
6659495 6661829 Shit!
6661914 6664624 - What the hell are you doin'?<br />- Get ready. Lean forward.
6664708 6667502 - What?<br />- Lean forward, goddamn it!
6667586 6671172 - Now it's gonna go fast. Lean forward.<br />- What the fuck you doin'?
6671256 6675176 - Oh, no, no!<br />- Lean forward! Get ready. Move your hands.
6675260 6679514 - Motherfuckin' shit! Shit! Oh, goddamn! Goddamn!<br />- Let's go. Let's go.
6679598 6682642 - Come on! Come on!<br />- Oh, fuck, my leg! Ow!

6695572 6698449 - Run, goddamn it! Run! Come on!<br />- I am!
6698534 6700535 - All right? Watch it, watch it!<br />- Yeah.

6733026 6737196 - I got shot in the leg. How do ya think I'm doin'?<br />- He's gonna be just fine.
6737280 6741284 - How 'bout you?<br />- All right. Got Ricky out of there?
6743287 6746247 Yeah, they found him.
6746330 6749333 - Are you gonna be all right?<br />- Got a bad headache.
6749418 6752545 - Think they're mad at me?<br />- I wouldn't worry about them.
6752629 6756215 They'll get to you eventually, but right now<br />they're busy with this salvage operation, I guess.
6756300 6759594 No! Dre -<br />Dredges. Dredges!
6759678 6762764 - They're wastin' their time.<br />There's no gold out there.<br />- What do you mean?
6762848 6765641 He took it with him.<br />He beat me.
6765726 6768227 - John, he beat all of us.<br />- He wasn't playin' against you.
6768312 6771397 Fuck that, McClane!<br />You're still alive, aren't ya?
