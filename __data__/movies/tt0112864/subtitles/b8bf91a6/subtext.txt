116300 118663 State Police and the FBI!
119011 120116 Lieutenant Jurgensen.
120118 122523 You plummer, I want you to<br />go to St. John's Emergency.
122773 124899 In case we got any walk-ins<br />from the street.
125688 127584 Kramer, get the city engineer!
128200 130582 I got to find out a damage report.<br />It's very important.
130584 133189 Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want<br />to blow up a department store?
133300 135006 Did you ever see a woman<br />miss a shoe sale?
135400 137600 Connie, I want you to get started<br />on the witness sheet.
137791 139035 Ricky you and Joe,
139036 141100 you make sure the uniforms<br />got it cordoned off there.
141293 143760 And you don't let the damn TV crews in.
144238 144892 Benson!
145000 146649 Inspector, phone.<br />Not now.
146650 148100 Benson! Traffic!
148323 150208 We get Fifth Avenue<br />cleared up by 3:00,
150210 151782 or we got the traffic jam from hell!
152009 153299 Walter!<br />Yeah?
153610 155585 I think you'd better take this.
159127 160877 Major Case Unit, Inspector Cobb.
161467 163752 <i>Said Simple Simon to the pie man<br />going to the fair.</i>
163761 165099 <i>Give me your pies...</i>
166100 167684 <i>or I'll cave your head in.</i>
168998 171502 <i>You see, Bonwit's was just<br />to make sure I had your attention.</i>
172537 174869 <i>Is there a detective named McClane there?</i>
175926 177150 He's on suspension.
177151 178717 <i>No Walter, he's not.</i>
179444 180539 <i>Not today.</i>
181000 181905 Who is this?
181983 183433 <i>Call me Simon.</i>
183782 184569 What do you want?
185010 186476 <i>I want to play a game.</i>
187000 188011 What kind of game?
188332 189825 <i>Simon says.</i>
191297 193866 <i>Simon's going to tell<br />Lieutenant McClane what to do,</i>
194005 196158 <i>and Lieutenant McClane is going to do it.</i>
197377 199855 <i>Non compliance will result in a penalty.</i>
201000 202186 What penalty?
202729 205348 <i>Another big bang in a very public place.</i>
208700 211149 <i>What is it that you want<br />Lieutenant McClane to do?</i>
211619 214318 <i>Simon says Lieutenant McClane<br />is to go to the corner</i>
214320 216580 <i>of 138th Street und Amsterdam,</i>
217009 219300 <i>which is in Harlem if I'm not mistaken.</i>
219302 221190 Kowalski! Lambert!
221602 223060 Do you know where to find McClane?
223600 225600 Well, I kinda doubt<br />you're gonna find him in church.
225634 228054 Well, you better find out<br />what rock he's under...
229359 230534 and kick it over.
242690 243523 John.
245100 245906 Thanks.
253757 255465 Gve me some more.<br />Come on.
257500 258703 Jesus, John.
258997 260166 You look like shit.
264918 266657 Where did we leave off with that roster?
267600 270792 We got three killings in Red Hook<br />the past two nights.
271281 272407 Put Miner on it.
272886 273778 And Genetti.
273780 275394 The mayor's office will call<br />before the day's out.
275716 279863 Next, 14 dump trucks stolen<br />from a yard in Staten Island.
280500 282627 Fourteen! Jesus!
282628 284617 Is somebody starting<br />a construction company?
284889 287289 Nah, it was John's landlady<br />going to clean his apartment.
289608 290904 Insurance fraud.
292100 294229 That's a priority out in California.
295200 297200 The contractor splits the money<br />with the thieves.
297202 299566 We had that out in Jersey<br />a couple years ago, Joe. Remember?
299865 301320 See what Kelly can do with it.
303475 305375 Hey, what was the lottery number<br />last night?
305700 307079 4667.
309706 311200 You still betting your badge, Rick?
311730 312513 Yeah,
312936 314937 6991 every week.
316500 318398 6991, lucky number.
318759 320745 Half the cops in New York<br />play their badges.
321425 322831 How're the kids, John?
324943 326083 I hear they're ok.
327900 329023 Did you talk with Holly?
333100 334302 No, I didn't talk to Holly.
334304 335656 Coming up on it, Inspector.
338098 340198 Is it hot in here,<br />or am I just scared to death?
340405 342051 You wanna make sure<br />the gun's secure?
343935 344989 Yeah, it's good.
353288 355751 You know, you're the first woman<br />since Holly who's seen me do this.
356025 357282 I'm honored.
357661 358526 Yeah...
359603 360763 so was she.
363676 364488 So,
365227 366884 where's the backup gonna be?
370300 371443 We're gonna drop back,
371610 373039 to 128th Street.
373856 374560 What?
376035 377950 Ten blocks?<br />Are you fucking kidding me?
379170 382446 Oh, man, that's just great!<br />Hey, Walter, what is all this about?
382615 385380 If we don't do it, this guy says he's<br />gonna blow up another public place.
385406 387328 Well, why me?<br />What does it got to do with me?
387353 390406 I have no idea.<br />He just said it had to be you.
392724 394005 It's nice to be needed.
395600 396898 Frankly John, you haven't been...
396900 399357 Hey Walter, how about you mind<br />your fucking business about Holly?
400600 401642 Between you and Simon,
401643 403449 you're fucking up<br />a perfectly good hangover.
407196 407944 Ok.
418306 421100 We'll be back to pick you up<br />in 15 minutes.
421186 422159 Take your time.
422728 424123 I expect to be dead before.
425296 426398 Let's go, Billy!
449600 450590 Oh, man.
478080 479007 Hey, yo, Uncle.
479477 480893 Come look at this.
482923 484902 It's ten after 9:00.<br />Why aren't you in school?
485082 486490 Tony wants to sell you this.
486711 487331 Tony?
487757 489631 That no-neck dude they call Bad T?
489922 491822 He says he found it in a Dumpster.
492100 494578 He keeps stealing from people,<br />they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.
494700 495979 No, he didn't steal it.
495980 497600 He says his uncle gave it to him.
499200 500741 Hand me that newspaper over there.
503528 505328 Don't ever let people use you.
505558 507694 You're running all over town<br />with stolen property.
507800 509600 If you get caught, you get in trouble
509602 511802 while he gets to deny<br />the whole thing and walk away.
512300 515400 You mean, you want us<br />to take it back to Tony?
515600 516396 No,
516397 517596 I'll take it back to Tony,
518107 519185 with a message.
519925 520760 Now,
520761 521737 where you going?
521954 523173 School.<br />Why?
523174 524325 To get educated?
524440 525249 Why?
525250 526661 So we can go to college.
526663 527942 And why is that important?
527943 528975 To get espect.
528977 531069 Respect.<br />And who's the bad guys?
531200 532592 Guys who sell drugs.
532879 533862 Guys who have guns.
533864 535664 And who's the good guys?<br />We're the good guys.
536000 537098 Who's gonna help you?
537099 537995 Nobody.
537997 540470 So who's gonna help you?<br />We're gonna help ourselves.
540530 542044 And who do we not want to help us?
542091 543044 White people.
543046 544096 That's right.
545688 547515 Now, get on outta here.<br />Go to school.
552989 554818 Uncle, you better come look at this.
554819 555459 What?
555600 557600 There's a white man standing<br />in the street.
557675 558733 I seen one.
558734 560375 Not like this.
570647 572042 Dial 911.
572043 574662 Tell the police to get up here quick.<br />Somebody's about to get killed.
576076 577733 And get your butts to school.<br />You hear me?
578200 579226 Yeah. Yeah.
579228 580128 Alright.
605720 606620 Morning.
608094 609181 Good morning.
609600 610957 You having a nice day, sir?
611678 613043 You feeling alright?
613045 614645 Not to get too personal,
614825 617100 but a white man standing<br />in the middle of Harlem
617125 619472 wearing a sign that says I hate niggers
619739 621900 has either got some serious<br />personal issues.
621996 623817 Or not all his dogs are barking.
624713 626413 Hey, I'm talking to you!
627500 629944 Now, you got about ten seconds<br />before those guys see you.
630196 632956 When they do, they will kill you.<br />You understand?
633259 636315 You are about to have a very bad day.
637136 638376 Tell me about it.
639995 641918 Sir, this is a police matter.<br />For your own safety, I'm gonna...
641920 643388 You damn right it's a police matter!
643390 644995 For your own safety,<br />I suggest you hide
644996 646609 your butt in my shop<br />till the police get here.
646767 648317 What the fuck?
650600 651741 Oh shit.
660000 661200 Listen, I'm a cop.<br />What?
661359 663630 I'm on a case, somebody blew up<br />Bonwit Teller's an hour ago.
663709 664871 Did you hear about that on the news?<br />Yeah.
664934 666430 The same asshole that did that said
666432 668581 I got to come to Harlem and do this<br />or he's gonna blow up something else.
668583 670167 Do you understand?<br />Shit, shit, shit.
670187 671031 Listen, I got a gun.
671032 672319 You should get across the street.<br />They got ten guns.
672321 674283 You should get across the street!<br />Look, start acting crazy, alright?
674305 676312 What? Like Looney Tunes.<br />You know, like Bellevue?
677000 678835 Hey Zeus, this a friend of yours?
678961 680606 He look like a friend of mine?
681600 683507 I think the dude just<br />escaped from some hospital.
683508 685552 You know, like Bellevue?
689548 690770 I am...
692255 693595 the voice of my own god.
696500 698600 I told the librarian that I had a bad<br />headache, but she didn't believe me.
698668 701737 I really do have a bad headache, though.<br />I have a very bad headache!
701739 703689 And my head does not feel...
705007 707400 Who in the fuck, you've made<br />a very bad mistake.
707600 709363 Put it through his head.<br />Bust his head.
710500 711734 Cut this shit off!
712470 713868 Fellas! Fellas!
714415 716009 Nature boy here hates niggers.
716010 717500 Now, what are we gonna do about that?
717502 719442 Fight him!<br />Yo, yo, yo, yo!
719443 720458 Hold up! Hold up!
720700 721334 Shit!
723600 724780 Get him! Get him!
725900 727641 Back! Back up!
727642 728800 Hey, what you tripping on?
729000 730171 Back the fuck up!
730419 731063 Now!
731208 732362 Hey, you better quit that, boy!
732364 733240 Come on, man, get up.
733298 734416 Get up! Get outta here!
737838 739847 Stop the cab!<br />Stop the goddam cab!
739849 741009 Don't shoot! No, don't shoot me!
741011 742000 Don't shoot!<br />Don't move that cab! Get up!
742002 743007 Come on, get up!
743290 744498 Yo, you saying you gonna kill us?
744578 746460 I don't want to, but I will!<br />You know I will!
746462 748040 Come on.<br />Drive! Drive!
748077 749728 Drive! Go! Go! Go!
749729 750849 Drive, goddam it!<br />Get the fuck outta here!

755317 756898 Run the red light! Drive!<br />Don't shoot me, man!
756900 758548 That's all I got.<br />Man, put that fucking money away!
758550 759965 Nobody's robbing you, asshole!<br />Don't kill me!
759988 761000 I theft you. Shit!
761114 762609 Just run all the lights! Drive!
762611 763489 We got a bus!<br />Oh, man.
763748 764443 Damn!
764859 766970 That cut deep?<br />How the hell would I know?
766972 768311 Just keep pressure on it.
769400 770395 Oh, fuck!
771798 772878 Jesus, right?
773106 775526 John McClane. I owe you one.<br />Damn right, you owe me!
775528 777829 You got any idea what those guys<br />are doing to my shop right now?
777831 779293 Chill out, Jesus!<br />Chill out? What the fuck?
779295 780387 We'll send a car for...<br />Are you trying to relate to me?
780389 781378 Talk like a white man!
781380 782918 Ok. Jesus, I'm sorry you<br />got involved, alright?
782920 785010 Why do you keep calling me Jesus?<br />I look Puerto Rican to you?
785016 786472 Guy back there called you Jesus.
786474 787798 Didn't he?<br />He didn't say Jesus!
787800 789185 He said. Hey, Zeus.
789229 791074 My name is Zeus.<br />Zeus?
791076 791965 Yeah, Zeus!
791966 794079 As in father of Apollo, mount Olympus!
794200 797000 Don't fuck with me, or I'll shove<br />a lightning bolt up your ass!
797085 797820 Zeus!
797821 799097 You got a problem with that?
800328 801541 No.<br />Shit!
801542 802726 I don't have a problem with that.
803098 804679 Downtown. Police Plaza.
805257 806656 That's just great.
818566 819949 It's textbook megalomania.
819950 821781 It's a pathological state
821800 824684 in which fantasies of control<br />or omnipotence predominate.
825232 826333 He wants control over him.
826345 828271 He wants control over his<br />actions, over his thoughts,
828272 829114 even his emotions.
829247 830959 Sounds like you got<br />a secret admirer, John.
831076 832702 Yeah, maybe he'll send me<br />some flowers.
832900 834323 Everybody knows you like pansies.
834641 836200 It's not that kind of emotion.
836400 837690 This guy is ugly.
838100 838946 How is that?
838998 841315 Nothing wrong with him<br />a shower would not cure.
841448 843941 Beer is normally taken internally, John.
844422 845620 Just get me some aspirins, will ya?
845622 847218 Yeah, ok. Hold this here.
848800 850756 This is Fred Schiller, John and he's a...
850800 852214 A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
852573 855014 Yes. I was saying that we're dealing with a...
855130 857898 megalomaniacal personality<br />with possible paranoid schizophrenia.
857900 859480 Hey, hey, how about<br />we just skip down
859481 861671 to the part where you tell me<br />what the fuck this has to do with me?
862300 863060 I don't know.
863643 866382 What I do know is it does<br />have specifically to do with you.
866400 869158 This guy wants to pound on you<br />till you crumble.
869751 871898 He wants you to dance<br />to his tune and then...
871900 873088 Put on a dress and fuck me?
875147 876892 I was going to say, kill you.
878111 880051 He's sitting on an awful lot of rage,
880209 883638 and it could be manifested physically<br />if he's stressed.
883704 885913 Somebody he arrested?<br />Somebody he pissed off?
886112 887656 That could be one hell of a long list.
887789 888844 Fuck you, Joe.
889035 891520 See, these people don't like<br />to work anonymously.
891522 893699 They want you to know<br />who's doing it to you.
893941 896098 So this name Simon<br />is probably not an alias.
896100 898300 It's probably Simon or some variation.
898328 902400 Simon, Robert E. Busted in '86,<br />extortion, kidnapping, ten to fifteen.
902700 906000 Did seven years for good behaviour.<br />Released on a state work-furlough two months ago.
906170 907869 Check it.<br />Thanks, Rick.
908238 911700 Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman<br />who kidnapped his partner's daughter.
911900 914700 He's a fuckup, not a psycho.<br />The guy we're looking for is nuts.
914900 916909 A nut who knows a lot about bombs.
917660 919488 We found this in a playground.
919666 920623 Professional!
920741 922522 Very cool stuff. You know.
923055 923793 Boom!
924171 925880 You think you should slam it<br />around like that, Charlie?
925882 927480 When it's unmixed, you can't hurt it.
927782 929174 This stuff is cutting edge.
929292 930533 It's a binary liquid.
930800 931601 A what?
931948 933155 Like epoxy.
933716 934926 Two liquids.
935634 937553 Either one by itself...
939900 940950 you got nothing,
941318 942906 but mix them...
954500 955413 Ricky.
960500 962620 Charlie, you're gonna be wearing<br />that shirt up your ass!
962622 964229 Christ Almighty, Charlie!
964300 965932 Like I said, very cool stuff.
966600 968816 Now, with a package like this,<br />you get a warning.
969067 970967 Now, the bomb has to arm itself.
971181 975230 You'll see the red liquid pump into<br />the clear before it detonates.
975595 976953 How long before?
977164 978900 Ten seconds, two minutes.
979156 980328 Could be anything.
980887 982104 But once it's mixed,
983100 984404 be somewhere else.
984489 986119 This stuff has got to be pretty rare.
986496 988588 We oughta be able to find out<br />if any of it's missing somewhere.
988590 989342 I already did.
989994 991725 Livermore Labs theft over the weekend.
992000 993558 He got enough to make<br />another one, Joe?
994421 995717 About 2,000 pounds.
996288 997267 Of that?
997560 999503 Well, the detonating<br />mechanism could be anything,
999527 1000800 radio, electrical.
1001100 1003173 Hell, you could use a beeper<br />and phone it in.
1003450 1004250 Inspector?
1004658 1007438 Inspector, it's him.<br />He's got a double Alberti feedback loop on it.
1007724 1010613 A nasty little trick I believe once used in Lebanon.<br />Charlie. Charlie!
1010718 1011535 Charlie.<br />What?
1012598 1013738 Wanna start the trace?
1021526 1022469 Simon.
1023188 1025945 <i>He wore the board,<br />walked the street and survived.</i>
1026425 1027520 <i>Hauptmann Walter.</i>
1027774 1029290 <i>Where are my pigeons now?</i>
1029735 1030676 Pigeons?
1031900 1033130 <i>I had two pigeons,</i>
1033131 1035435 <i>bright and gay,<br />fly from me the other day.</i>
1035700 1037063 <i>Why was it they did go?</i>
1037162 1038968 <i>You cannot tell.<br />You do not know.</i>
1039100 1040260 You mean McClane?
1040784 1043027 <i>No, I mean Santa Claus.</i>
1045421 1046344 Yeah, I'm here.
1047164 1049266 <i>There after all and your friend?</i>
1049867 1052439 Carver! Carver! Come on.<br />We need you in the other room.
1052700 1054394 Let's go! Come on!
1054395 1055532 They need you. Go.
1056059 1057194 Yeah, he's here too.
1057195 1058831 <i>And may I speak with him?</i>
1061019 1063119 <i>Well, is the ebony Samaritan there now?</i>
1063364 1064782 You got a problem with ebony?
1064783 1065900 <i>No, no.</i>
1066200 1069976 <i>My only problem is that I went to some<br />trouble preparing that game for McClane.</i>
1070600 1072441 <i>You interfered with a well-laid plan.</i>
1072900 1076900 Yeah? Well, you can stick your<br />well-laid plan up your well-laid ass.
1079379 1080792 That was not smart.
1081155 1083235 There are lives at stake here!
1083477 1084798 Not enough time, Inspector.
1084799 1086473 You better hope he calls back.
1087300 1088331 He will.
1090810 1093818 Ricky, you wanna tell those people<br />to shut the hell up out there!
1093864 1095591 Hey, keep it down here!
1105060 1105846 Simon,
1107052 1108582 he wasn't speaking for all of us.
1108800 1111576 <i>That was unpleasant.<br />Don't let it happen again.</i>
1112200 1113811 <i>So, what's your name, boy?</i>
1113912 1115131 Don't call me boy.
1115511 1116369 <i>I'm sorry.</i>
1116607 1118595 <i>It was a poor attempt at humor.</i>
1118921 1121123 <i>I was going to send you home<br />with a chiding,</i>
1121400 1122856 <i>but now I think perhaps</i><br />We got him!
1122858 1124012 <i>You should join the game.</i>
1124160 1125238 It's a pay phone,
1125279 1126322 in Oslo.
1126400 1128200 No wait, they say it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />Norway?
1128400 1131000 No, wait. No, wait.<br />Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.
1131200 1132562 Forget it! Australia?
1132563 1133627 He's scrambling up their system.
1133629 1134645 They don't know where he is.
1135000 1137338 <i>Having fun with<br />the phone company, are we?</i>
1138000 1139259 <i>Simon says,</i>
1139260 1140822 <i>McClane and the Samaritan,</i>
1140824 1143735 <i>will go to the subway station<br />at 72nd and Broadway.</i>
1143911 1147208 <i>I will call you in 15 minutes<br />on the pay phone outside the station.</i>
1147400 1148220 <i>No police.</i>
1148221 1150809 <i>Failure to answer will<br />constitute noncompliance.</i>
1151200 1153500 <i>Do you understand me, John?</i>
1153800 1155020 Oh, yes, I understand.
1155708 1157355 I understand that you're a fucking wacko
1157357 1159266 that likes to play kids games,<br />that's what I understand.
1159311 1160269 <i>Hardly.</i>
1160270 1161371 Hardly?
1161496 1163400 Well, then, who are you?<br />Somebody I sent up?
1163726 1164664 What'd you do?
1164800 1166830 Shoplifting? Purse snatching?
1167424 1168800 Cross dressing? What?
1169200 1173300 <i>You c-c-couldn't catch me if I stole<br />your ch-chair with you in it.</i>
1173500 1175680 My ch-ch-ch-chair with me in it?
1176533 1177506 That's very exciting.
1177508 1178828 Let me ask you a question, bonehead.
1178915 1181407 Why are you trying to k-k-k-kill me?
1181435 1183400 <i>John, John, calm yourself.</i>
1183402 1184975 Why don't you come on down<br />here to Police Plaza
1184977 1186634 and we'll figure this out<br />like a couple of men?
1186900 1187867 Come on down here.
1188321 1189825 <i>If killing you was all I wanted</i>
1189827 1191253 Simon?<br /><i>You'd be dead by now.</i>
1191388 1192599 This is Inspector Cobb.
1192600 1194782 I can appreciate your feelings for McClane.
1195400 1197308 Believe me, the jerk isn't worth it.
1198200 1200418 He's stepped on so many<br />toes in this department
1200420 1202820 by this time next month<br />he's gonna be a security guard.
1203266 1205266 His own wife wants nothing to do with him.
1205500 1208729 And he's about two steps shy<br />of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.
1208900 1210139 One step. One step.
1211609 1212713 Now listen to me.
1213600 1215263 You sound like a real smart guy.
1216158 1217293 What is it that you want?
1217337 1218875 <i>Are you talking about money?</i>
1219435 1221003 Well, whatever, whatever.
1222405 1224471 McClane is a toilet bug.
1225121 1228421 Now what would it take just to forget<br />him and live happily ever after?
1228712 1230512 <i>You know, money is shit to me.</i>
1230735 1232287 <i>I would not give up McClane</i>
1232510 1234955 <i>for all the gold in your Fort Knox.</i>
1235300 1236915 <i>72nd Street subway,</i>
1236916 1238404 <i>pay phone, 15 minutes.</i>
1238429 1240209 <i>McClane and the Samaritan.</i>
1240600 1243100 <i>If you're competent in the least,<br />you've found the briefcase</i>
1243298 1245832 <i>so you know what I mean by penalty.</i>
1249043 1251043 I wanna thank you for that vote<br />of confidence, Walter.
1251297 1252895 Well, I thought it was worth a try.
1253317 1254580 This guy's a raving maniac.
1254582 1257139 Well he, he couldn't be any clearer<br />if he got it from a case history.
1257290 1259129 He gave you clues to his identity.
1259388 1260489 He spoke German.
1260490 1262233 He called it your Fort Knox.
1262437 1264300 And he stammered<br />when McClane pushed him.
1264367 1266317 Now, you believe this guy<br />really can't be bought?
1266566 1267540 There's no chance.
1267541 1270234 The very mention of money<br />only enraged him further.
1278745 1279463 What's that?
1279894 1281394 It's your shield.
1282500 1283895 You asking me to be a cop again, Walter?
1283897 1285121 Ricky, get him his gun, alright?
1285123 1287180 You didn't answer my question. Hey!<br />Joe, this time they...
1288983 1290731 You didn't answer my question, Walter.
1292332 1293733 Are you done, Lieutenant?
1295200 1298300 Now, you two better get going if you're<br />going to get up to 72nd Street on time.
1298600 1300628 Joe, this time they go with backup.<br />You got it.
1301055 1301878 Come on, you guys!
1302714 1304025 I'm not going anywhere.
1304027 1305702 Simon says you got to go!
1305704 1308062 I'm not jumping through<br />hoops for some psycho!
1308109 1310047 That's a white man with white problems.
1310048 1311043 You deal with him.
1311106 1313226 Call me when he crosses 110th Street.<br />Hey!
1315103 1316243 Why'd you save my ass?
1316245 1317192 I didn't.
1317807 1320125 I stopped a white cop from<br />getting killed in Harlem.
1320400 1322255 One white cop gets killed today
1322338 1324429 tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,
1324430 1326129 all of them with itchy trigger fingers.
1326131 1326978 Got it?
1329162 1330355 Get him back.
1332898 1334180 Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?
1334181 1334998 Chinatown.
1335400 1336218 Shit.
1337400 1338226 Zeus!
1338708 1340370 Yo, partner! Wait up!
1340372 1342220 Hey, hey, hey, hey!<br />I ain't your partner.
1342279 1344384 I ain't your neighbour,<br />your brother or your friend.
1344385 1345779 I'm your total stranger.
1347300 1348706 Ok, stranger...
1349840 1352940 you know where that park is<br />at 115th Street and St Nicholas?
1355292 1356574 Yeah, it's in Harlem.
1356575 1358075 Where do you think<br />we found that bomb?
1359151 1359924 Listen,
1360810 1362620 this guy doesn't care about skin color,
1363379 1364522 even if you do.
1366624 1367889 What am I doing?
1367890 1369938 Cheer up. Things could be worse.
1370900 1372639 I was working on a nice, fat suspension,
1373200 1375709 smoking cigarettes<br />and watching Captain Kangaroo.
1375936 1376759 Come on.
1380900 1382700 Is that the phone?
1386396 1388496 Ok, they made it to the phone,<br />but there is a problem.
1388800 1390777 <i>Well, what do you mean?<br />How big a problem?</i>
1390812 1392496 Oh, about 300 pounds.
1393100 1394331 And they're probably going to end up...
1394333 1396374 Ma'am, we need<br />this phone for official police business.
1396376 1397125 Do you mind!
1397127 1398987 Honey, I'm a cop.<br />I need the phone right now.
1399157 1401526 Get off the damn phone, lady!<br />Police business!
1401768 1403829 Well, I never!<br />I can get used to this.
1404298 1406716 I'm sure you can find a phone<br />across the street, ma'am.
1407200 1408176 Let's get something straight.
1408178 1409915 I'm the only one here<br />on official police business.
1409917 1412600 Don't ever do that shit again.<br />Let's get something else straight.
1412800 1414900 You need me a lot more<br />than I need you.
1414997 1417078 You don't like the way I do things, fine.
1417079 1418000 I quit.
1426843 1428056 Alright, I need you.
1434651 1436707 Alright, I need you<br />more than you need me.

1450810 1453178 Why was the phone busy?<br />Who were you calling?
1453614 1454745 The Psychic Hotline.
1454747 1456547 <i>I'd advise you to take this<br />more seriously.</i>
1456549 1458518 Look, it's a public phone!<br />What do you want me to say?

1551134 1552816 The guy and his wives<br />aren't going anywhere.
1553088 1554000 What are they doing?

1558209 1559885 The guy. Just the guy.
1560465 1562500 Just one guy? Just one guy.<br />The answer's one.
1562582 1565367 How do you dial one?<br />555-0001.

1652966 1654459 Ninety blocks in 30 minutes?
1654500 1655621 In New York traffic?
1656563 1657856 It could be double that.
1658454 1659650 We don't even have a car!
1661100 1663100 Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!<br />I'm a cop! I'm a cop!
1663102 1665296 I am requisitioning this car<br />for official police business.
1665298 1666552 What are you doing?<br />Thank you very much.
1666554 1667908 What the fuck you doing to my car?<br />Get in! Get in!
1667910 1670049 Pretty slick.<br />Listen, I used to drive a cab.
1670050 1671344 The fastest way south is...
1672300 1674700 What the fuck are you doing?
1679600 1680649 What were you saying?
1681319 1683725 I was saying I used to drive a cab.
1683727 1685692 Ninth Avenue is the fastest way south.
1686325 1687906 But we seem to be going east.
1694100 1695461 Where the hell are you going, McClane?
1695515 1697163 I told you Ninth Avenue was<br />the quickest way south!
1697182 1699091 Stop with that goddam yelling!<br />I know what I'm doing!
1699093 1700901 Not even God knows what you're doing!
1700967 1703492 They're headed east on 72nd<br />towards the park.
1703494 1704651 But Wall Street is south!
1704653 1706675 Man, stop yelling at me,<br />I got a bad headache!
1707147 1710254 And the best way south is not<br />Ninth Avenue, it's through the park.
1712300 1714600 Oh, dear.
1714800 1716900 I told you the park drive<br />is always jammed.
1716902 1718302 I didn't say park drive.
1721600 1722732 I said through the park.
1726247 1727783 Shit! We lost them.
1727784 1729000 They're in the park headed south.
1730400 1731485 Get outta here!
1732542 1733531 Fucking prick!
1739557 1741607 I got him, Connie.<br />He's taking the scenic route.

1754600 1756400 Watch it, watch it, watch it,<br />watch it! Oh, my God!
1756794 1758400 Are you...<br />Are you aiming for these people?
1758402 1758952 No.

2365388 2367244 You can see right down into the subway.
2367664 2368929 How many fire trucks do you count?
2368956 2371268 You guys! You guys!<br />How can you see it from up here?
2373351 2374633 Damn! Get in there.
2374734 2377067 Officer, tell those people<br />to get the hell back, will ya?
2378894 2380648 We got a shitload of cuts and bruises,
2380655 2383086 a couple concussions some<br />old guy's pacemaker stopped,
2383087 2385193 and a pregnant girl's<br />water broke and that's all.
2385624 2386648 How're you doing, John?
2386650 2388088 Still can't hear too good.
2389170 2392075 Well, it's a miracle you're still alive.<br />It's a goddam miracle.
2392300 2393765 Yeah, that's the problem, Joe.
2393766 2394600 What?
2394800 2395686 The miracle part.
2396645 2398747 What are the odds of us<br />making it down here on time?
2399790 2400320 Zip.
2400716 2402298 That bomb was gonna go<br />off no matter what.
2402300 2404153 He wanted it to go off right down here.
2404600 2405826 Take this off me, Dave.
2407274 2408915 Well, what's so special about this place?
2409608 2411338 I don't know.<br />Something just doesn't add up.
2411340 2412199 Lieutenant McClane?
2413498 2415283 They're asking for you and a Mr Carver.
2417371 2418902 Where?<br />John?
2421700 2424710 John, this is Andy Cross with the FBI.
2426000 2429900 This is MrJarvis. He's...<br />I'm, with another agency.
2430300 2431565 It's good to meet you.
2431566 2432900 This is Lieutenant McClane.
2432973 2434495 This is Mr Carver.
2436200 2438407 We've got a couple of questions first.
2439219 2440451 Do you recognize this guy?
2445553 2446370 No.
2447550 2448700 How about this one?
2453489 2454637 How about you?
2456955 2458732 Did you recognize<br />the voice on the phone?
2459462 2460383 No.
2461611 2462565 Did you...
2462979 2464775 notice any cars following you?
2467820 2468583 No.
2468995 2470455 Anybody following you at all?
2470621 2472001 Any kind of surveillance?
2472487 2474612 Telephone? House?<br />Anything unusual at all?
2476481 2477185 Well,
2478360 2480674 now that you mention it,<br />I have experienced a...
2481400 2483880 you know, like a burning sensation<br />between my toes.
2483882 2486719 I thought it was just some athlete's<br />foot or something.
2490100 2491407 We read your jacket, Lieutenant.
2492306 2494000 We were told you would be cooperative.
2494300 2495834 Cooperate with what?<br />Hey, now wait a minute.
2495836 2497263 He will be.<br />We're wasting time here,
2497278 2499055 You wanna share information,<br />in this goddam van.
2499205 2500820 How about sending<br />a little our way as well?
2500822 2502975 Look, we wanna hear<br />what he knows first.
2502976 2504354 What the hell, you give us pictures and...
2504356 2506298 Look we want to hear what he knows first.
2506300 2508013 Hey, I know as much as you know alright?
2509851 2511526 There's a guy out there setting off bombs.
2512543 2513851 He calls himself Simon.
2514152 2515679 He speaks with a German accent.
2516400 2518725 And for some reason<br />he's very angry with me.
2519413 2521313 And maybe you can tell me why, fellas?
2527490 2529381 The first man there is Methias Targo.
2529718 2531267 Was Hungarian army.
2531350 2532575 Explosives expert.
2532677 2534301 Now we believe<br />he's working for the Iranians.
2534342 2535042 Working?
2535235 2536799 Freelance terrorism,
2536987 2538145 by contract.
2539896 2541696 Who's the girl?<br />Targo's other half.
2541873 2545248 Rumor is the Israelis slipped a bomb<br />in between their sheets, so...
2545609 2548040 He wasn't at home,<br />but they think maybe they got her.
2548500 2549422 The second man,
2549601 2551116 was an obscure colonel,
2551117 2552600 in the East German army.
2553000 2554307 He ran an infiltration unit.
2554333 2557078 The kind of thing the Nazis did<br />at the Battle of the Bulge.
2557257 2559242 English-speaking troops...
2559243 2560708 Yeah, yeah, I saw the movie.
2561559 2563136 All we know of him is...
2563137 2566459 the G.D.R. medical records<br />show he suffers from migraines.
2566780 2569480 His name is Peter Krieg.
2572186 2574791 Well, that is an exceptional report, fellas.
2575900 2578281 Now do you wanna tell me<br />what the hell this has to do with me?
2578428 2580806 The name Gruber mean anything<br />to you, Lieutenant?
2585801 2586955 It rings a bell, yeah.
2588340 2589059 L.A.
2589600 2591399 What?<br />That thing in the building in L.A.
2594166 2595279 Peter Krieg,
2596036 2596965 was born,
2597021 2600050 Simon Peter Gruber.
2601500 2604146 He's Hans Gruber's brother.
2608800 2609619 Oh, shit.
2609620 2611864 Yeah, it's that thing in L.A.
2613000 2616039 We figure he's got you<br />fitted up for a toe tag,
2616041 2618948 and he's gonna do anything to get it tied.
2619043 2620055 Inspector!
2620719 2622080 Inspector, it's him!
2623489 2625178 Don't let him know we're here.
2629141 2630059 Simon.
2630542 2631958 <i>Inspector.</i>
2632400 2635048 <i>Now, who from the FBI<br />is in the van, I wonder?</i>
2635298 2637298 <i>Let's see.<br />Almost certainly Cross.</i>
2637445 2639434 <i>Come on, Andrew. Say hello.</i><br />Hello.
2640349 2643600 <i>And I know you never run alone,<br />so say hello, Bill.</i>
2643685 2646704 <i>Still trying to butch up<br />by chewing on your glasses?</i>
2649000 2650969 <i>This, gentlemen as they say,</i>
2650970 2652955 <i>is where the plot thickens.</i>
2653824 2656222 <i>I have put 2,400 pounds of explosive</i>
2656224 2659400 <i>in one of the 1,446 schools<br />in greater New York.</i>
2659510 2663595 <i>It is fitted with a timer<br />set to explode at exactly 3:00 pm.</i>
2665455 2666381 <i>Thank you.</i>
2666382 2668129 <i>Your silence says I'm understood.</i>
2668131 2670908 Did you say 2,400 pounds?
2670910 2672710 <i>Yes, but please don't interrupt again.</i>
2672976 2674136 <i>Simon says,</i>
2674410 2677800 <i>if you attempt to evacuate schools<br />the bomb will be detonated by radio.</i>
2677896 2680115 <i>And gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.</i>
2680251 2683227 <i>Repeat, one school will<br />be dismissed at 3:00 pm,</i>
2683482 2684394 <i>permanently.</i>
2684498 2685934 <i>Unless...</i><br />Unless what?
2686126 2690100 <i>Unless John McClane and his new best<br />friend complete the tasks I set them.</i>
2690329 2691563 <i>John are you listening?</i>
2693951 2694904 Yeah.
2695644 2698443 <i>The pay phone beyond Hope,<br />Tomkins Square Park.</i>
2698604 2701103 <i>Twenty minutes.<br />Go by foot. No rush.</i>
2701577 2704378 <i>If you're really clever you'll<br />learn the location of the bomb</i>
2704380 2705838 <i>and the code to disarm it.</i>
2706000 2707800 <i>Oh and by the way gentlemen,</i>
2707934 2710786 <i>we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.</i>
2711091 2715600 <i>The only problem is the darn things seem<br />to respond to police and FBI frequencies.</i>
2715733 2716918 <i>So if I were you,</i>
2716919 2718617 <i>I'd keep off your radios.</i>
2719073 2720364 Simon, wait.
2725232 2728080 Twenty-four hundred pounds<br />of that liquid stuff.
2728500 2729471 My God.
2730651 2731600 Get me the commissioner.
2731800 2734676 He's doing a press conference.<br />He's supposed to be here in half an hour.
2734822 2737822 Alright, Ricky, get every senior officer<br />on the site and get them here right away.
2738035 2740300 You're not gonna give me<br />any jurisdictional nonsense on this?
2740381 2742962 I got two kids in the school on 64th Street.
2744404 2746304 What can I do to help you?<br />How many men have you got?
2746600 2747502 Seventy-five.
2747503 2748730 But if I push the panic button,
2748731 2750071 I can get 500 from Washington.
2750200 2750816 When?
2750817 2752149 2:30, 3:00.
2752500 2753889 Between now and then...
2754789 2756863 We're gonna have<br />to do this all by ourselves.
2757028 2758071 Let's go.
2759100 2762300 And Tomkins Square Park is more than<br />2 miles away so you guys better get running.
2762500 2764141 No radios.<br />You take my telephone.
2764800 2766805 You get anything,<br />you call me through the switchboard.
2767200 2767859 Good luck.
2768300 2769197 Thanks.
2769640 2770794 Find that bomb.
2771600 2772495 Ricky, where are they?
2772496 2773500 Right over here.
2773502 2776156 The senior man present is Chief Allen.<br />Chief of what?
2776600 2778350 Transit.<br />Ok, thanks, Ricky.
2778789 2780877 Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.
2780878 2781690 Chief Allen.
2782000 2783353 The man who has done this,
2783613 2784699 has told us that he has planted
2784700 2786457 another very large bomb
2786458 2788767 in a school here in the New York area.
2789600 2791101 And he has told us<br />that we cannot evacuate,
2791102 2793819 but he has not said<br />that we cannot search.
2794468 2797323 Now, I recommend we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody,
2797325 2799887 I'm talking about police,<br />transit, sanitation, fire,
2800004 2801445 even the goddam librarians,
2801447 2803271 and we start searching schools,
2803272 2805151 and I mean right now.
2805362 2808176 I'm talking about a thousand buildings<br />within the city limits
2808178 2810733 and we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it in.
2810916 2813852 Now, I'd like to keep the media<br />out of this as long as possible
2813854 2816229 because if they get in,<br />we've got a panic.
2816900 2818124 Are we in agreement?
2818900 2820240 Come on, guys. Let's go!
2822100 2827200 Move it out! Move it out!<br />No radio contact. No radio contact.
2836854 2838130 They bought it.
2840542 2841530 You can begin.
2856735 2857570 Hook,
2858133 2859014 line,
2862300 2864052 and sinker.
2905800 2906782 Sergeant Turley!
2907561 2908858 Sergeant Turley!
2909057 2912200 In the last five minutes, the volume<br />of calls in here has tripled!
2912204 2915350 What the hell is going on?<br />Stop. Let me explain.
2916333 2917456 For the rest of the day,
2917458 2919643 we're supposed to handle<br />the department's communications.
2919645 2921131 What do you mean handle?
2921790 2923419 They're shutting down the police band.
2923981 2925999 All calls will be coming<br />through this switchboard.
2926000 2928100 And I'm gonna marry Donald Trump!
2928204 2929916 Walsh, what's going on?
2930361 2932404 Why'd everybody tear out of here?
2932773 2934610 Come on, Pamela.<br />Look at your watch!
2934910 2936625 It's coming up on shift change.
2936800 2938600 The bean counters are worried<br />about overtime,
2938625 2941430 so we sent everybody back<br />to the precinct to punch out.
2941432 2943140 The next shift is gonna<br />be here in a minute.
2943141 2945032 You are so full of shit, Walsh!
2945575 2946600 Thank you.
2954545 2955663 What the hell?
2965800 2966416 Hey!
2968375 2969364 Detective,
2969869 2971066 Bob Thompson,
2971683 2973193 city engineer's office.
2974500 2976265 We'd like to get an idea of the damage.
2978882 2981882 Man, you guys really got here fast.
2983200 2983926 Well,
2984950 2986286 it's Wall Street, sir.
2987121 2988260 A lot of money here.
2989283 2991101 A lot of opinion makers,
2991632 2993997 the mayor doesn't<br />wanna piss off, you know?
2995737 2996736 Is this it?
3000200 3001715 Holy Toledo!
3003400 3005093 Somebody had fun.
3006383 3009680 I'd appreciate it if you'd show<br />my associates the way down.
3012413 3013799 Yeah. Yeah, sure.
3013988 3014826 Jimmy!
3015200 3016590 You got the flashlight?
3016864 3018480 Murphy, come on, you too!
3019181 3021281 Rick Walsh.<br />John Gunther.
3021675 3022983 Come on, gentlemen. Let's go!
3027500 3029076 You were probably at the World Trades.
3029287 3030669 You know what that mess was.
3063400 3066701 Please inform Mr Little<br />that Mr Vanderfloog is here.
3067200 3068468 Mr Vanderfloog?
3071800 3073768 There's a Mr Vanderfloog for Mr Little.
3088300 3089533 Go down 20 metres!
3090755 3091821 Come on!
3091900 3092786 A lot of steam down here.
3092812 3094801 Yeah, yeah. We snapped<br />a couple of the steam pipes.
3094900 3095863 It's like a sauna.
3096010 3098802 We got the subway guys<br />to shut down the third rail.
3098850 3099797 It's on emergency lighting.
3099799 3101521 Yeah, emergency lights,<br />and there is still some light.
3101615 3102388 Hey!
3103500 3104469 No shooting!
3105595 3107567 Speak English!<br />Otto doesn't speak English!
3107568 3108514 Do you Otto?
3108854 3110298 Where the hell did we get this guy?
3110299 3111712 He's one of Targo's thugs.
3114307 3115505 Pull all the way up!
3115588 3117305 Pull all the way!<br />Pull all the way!
3124500 3126806 So what's up with this L.A. thing?<br />You famous or something?
3127200 3128665 Yeah, for about five minutes.
3129408 3131659 Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?<br />Fuck you.
3132300 3133847 You know this guy<br />Simon we're talking to?
3133849 3134434 Yeah.
3134700 3138500 I threw his little brother off the 32nd<br />floor of Nakatomi Towers out in L.A.
3139421 3141121 I guess he's a little pissed off about it.
3141249 3143331 Wait a minute.<br />You mean to tell me I'm in this shit...
3143451 3146428 because some white cop threw some<br />white asshole's brother off a roof?
3192390 3194752 Mr Vanderfloog?<br />Felix Little, corporate relations.
3194851 3197951 Sorry you had to wait, but apparently<br />there was an explosion in the subway.
3198300 3200074 It's played hell with our alarms,<br />I'm afraid.
3200400 3201548 I trust there is nothing wrong.
3201549 3203776 Oh, no. Good Lord, no.<br />Safe and secure.
3204500 3207400 Now, you were concerned<br />about a currency exchange?
3207600 3210699 We are not a commercial bank,<br />in the normal sense.
3210900 3211727 We're...
3211966 3213212 We're primarily...
3213941 3216570 governments, central banks,<br />that sort of thing.
3216742 3218587 Apart from the depository, of course.
3218588 3219799 Of course.<br />Yeah.
3220051 3222600 And you are in the flower business,<br />Mr Vanderfloog?
3226262 3227620 Back! Back!
3227957 3228911 Come on!
3253900 3254740 Come on!
3269063 3271441 Oh, no, Mr Vanderfloog,<br />that's the vault elevator.
3273105 3274040 Sorry is not.
3274181 3276378 Our alarms are sonic and seismic.
3276468 3279207 Two things which, I'm afraid,<br />do not react well to explosions.
3279400 3282955 You know, this subway business has<br />knocked all our systems into a cocked hat.
3283400 3285909 In fact, we've had to give up<br />and pull the plug on the whole thing.
3286400 3287951 The repair people<br />are downstairs now.
3288350 3289933 Good Lord!<br />Yes, yes.
3290407 3292898 Heavens to Betsy!<br />If anyone knew!
3296922 3297630 But...
3298180 3300009 I thought this was a<br />currency exchange.
3301280 3303800 I think we'll go straight to the withdrawal.
3307661 3308676 Go to bed.
3352300 3354700 Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here<br />and take a look at this?
3354827 3356104 Something's going on.
3357500 3359300 What do you think, guys?<br />You'll be able to fix that?
3359374 3360786 Just a minute now.
3365100 3366168 Ok, I'll be right back.
3366435 3367421 Down!
3372400 3373214 Stay back!
3374700 3375669 Stay back!
3409800 3411273 Come on. Come on.
3411485 3412188 Shit.
3422500 3424039 Come on.<br /><i>Front desk.</i>
3424100 3426800 Yes. Call the police. Get your ass<br />down here right now! I'm under attack!
3427000 3429900 <i>Hey, just relax, mate.<br />Maybe you'll live through this.</i>
3430200 3430889 Shit!
3454162 3455448 I think he's dead, my dear.
3458900 3461206 Alright.<br />Let's see to the office work.
3506400 3508531 $140 billion.
3509800 3511658 Ten times what's in Kentucky.
3513000 3514224 Fort Knox.
3514852 3516040 It's for tourists.
3530200 3531924 Yeah. McClane.
3532400 3534256 <i>John, you're out of shape?</i>
3534257 3535698 <i>You barely made it.</i>
3536062 3537888 Yeah, well, we all barely make it.
3538272 3539462 What do you want us to do?
3539800 3542271 <i>What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?</i>
3542800 3543627 What?
3544085 3546100 What... What did he say?
3546500 3548500 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3548635 3550208 What's the matter with you?<br />Don't you have kids?
3550895 3552076 That's an elephant joke.
3560500 3561399 That a bomb?
3562800 3563930 Yeah. Go, go ahead and grab it.
3564214 3565290 No. You're the cop.
3565621 3567400 Man, Simon said you're supposed<br />to be helping with this.
3567425 3568325 I'm helping.
3568529 3569763 Well, when're you gonna start helping?
3569764 3571041 After you get the bomb.
3589200 3590073 Careful.
3590655 3591600 I'm being careful.
3591900 3592801 Don't open it.
3592802 3593485 What?
3593900 3594865 I got to open it.
3595632 3596866 And it's gonna be alright.
3609200 3610674 Shit! Shit!
3610862 3612854 I told you not to open it!
3617600 3619056 <i>I trust you see the message.</i>
3619819 3622570 <i>It has a proximity circuit,<br />so, please, don't run.</i>
3623300 3624885 Yeah, I got it.<br />We're not gonna run.
3625074 3626400 How do we turn this thing off?
3626700 3628662 On the fountain there should be two jugs.
3628811 3629793 <i>Do you see them?</i>
3630100 3631974 <i>A five-gallon and a three-gallon.</i>
3632614 3634164 <i>Fill one of the jugs</i>
3634166 3636436 <i>with exactly four gallons of water...</i>
3636551 3638132 <i>and place it on the scale</i>
3638133 3639851 <i>and the timer will stop.</i>
3640200 3641666 <i>You must be precise.</i>
3641667 3644600 <i>One ounce more or less<br />will result in detonation.</i>
3644900 3647013 <i>If you're still alive in five minutes,<br />we'll speak then.</i>
3647015 3648077 Wait! Wait a sec...
3652700 3653954 I don't get it. Do you get it?
3653955 3654651 No.
3656900 3658032 Get the jugs.
3660500 3663709 Obviously, we can't fill the three-gallon jug<br />with four gallons of water, right?
3663800 3664465 Obviously.
3664466 3665968 Alright. I know. Here we go.
3666475 3669042 We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?
3669600 3670345 Ok. Now.
3670450 3672736 We pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug,
3673000 3675697 giving us exactly three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug, right?
3675800 3676816 Right. Ok.<br />Then what?
3676855 3679999 Now, take the three-gallon jug,<br />fill that a third of the way up...
3680000 3681433 No. He said be precise.<br />Shit!
3681493 3682579 Exactly four gallons.
3682610 3686012 Every cop in 50 miles is running his ass off,<br />and I'm out here playing kids games in a park.
3686229 3686884 Hey!
3688200 3690482 You wanna focus on the problem at hand?
3706878 3707958 I thought you said you knew!
3708262 3710005 You said don't say anything<br />if you don't know!
3710020 3711394 I thought you said...<br />Gve me the fucking jug.
3711396 3712759 We're starting over.<br />No! We can't now!
3712761 3713896 We can start over!<br />Pour that out!
3713944 3715346 We're starting over.<br />Gve me the fucking jug.
3715348 3716845 I'm gonna put my foot up<br />your ass, you dumb mother...
3716847 3717842 Say it! Say it!
3719034 3720703 What?<br />You were gonna call me a nigger, weren't you?
3720711 3721477 No, I wasn't!
3721500 3722905 Yes, you were.<br />What were you gonna call me?
3722907 3723844 Asshole!
3724200 3725700 How's that, asshole?
3725900 3728066 You got some fucking problem<br />with me because I'm white, Zeus?
3728137 3730051 Is that it? Have I oppressed you?
3730052 3731831 Have I oppressed your people somehow?
3732000 3734372 I'll tell you what your problem is.<br />You don't like me because you're a racist!
3735000 3735518 What?
3735541 3737347 You're a racist.<br />You don't like me because I'm white.
3737349 3739620 I don't like you because<br />you're gonna get me killed!
3740127 3741116 How much time?
3741365 3742131 Oh shit!
3742246 3743352 We got less than a minute.
3743705 3745758 Throw this thing away.<br />No, we can't take it off of there.
3745773 3747731 It'll detonate. Just, wait.<br />Wait a second. Wait a second.
3750300 3752622 I got it! I got it!<br />Exactly two gallons in here, right?
3752624 3753104 Right.
3753106 3755324 Leaving exactly one gallon<br />of empty space, right?
3755340 3757100 Yeah.<br />A full five gallons here, right?
3757102 3758382 Right.<br />If you pour one gallon
3758383 3759999 out of the five gallons<br />into there we have exactly...
3760001 3761403 Four gallons in there! Yes!
3761405 3762391 Pour it in there! Come on!
3763206 3764002 Come on!
3765500 3767000 Don't spill. Don't spill it!
3768109 3770248 Good, good, good!<br />Exactly four gallons.
3770249 3771061 You did it, McClane.
3771070 3772210 Put it on the thing!<br />Get it down there!
3772211 3773170 Oh, shit.
3781535 3784635 Congratulations.<br />You're still alive.
3785624 3787100 <i>Congratulations.</i>
3787300 3788200 Yeah, we did it.
3788201 3790447 You surprise me again, John.
3790900 3792968 This is becoming an ugly habit.
3793100 3795654 Yeah, well, I don't have the time<br />right now, Simon. Listen.
3796264 3797245 Deal's a deal.
3797246 3798500 Where's the school bomb?
3798502 3801021 On the contrary,<br />you have lots of time.
3801720 3802526 You have...
3804100 3807130 two hours and 47 minutes precisely.
3807300 3809710 Plenty of time to test those wits of yours.
3809900 3810732 <i>Hey! Hey!</i>
3810734 3812025 Hey, listen, jerk-off!
3812200 3814800 Let me tell you something!<br />I got a bad fucking hangover, alright?
3815011 3817913 And I'm a little sick of these fucking<br />riddles! Now, where is the school bomb?
3817915 3819217 <i>Temper, John.</i>
3819319 3821908 The road to truth has many turns.
3822500 3825344 You will find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3826100 3828392 When you undertake<br />the trip it suggests,
3828607 3830207 ask yourself this question:
3830500 3833264 What is 21 out of 42?
3836300 3838802 We're behind.<br />We should abandon the rest and go.
3838900 3840070 Relax, Targo.
3840071 3841986 There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3842199 3845129 He's sending us to the home<br />team dugout at Yankee Stadium.
3845772 3846486 Why?
3846700 3847858 Well, we're the home team.
3847860 3849147 Are we supposed<br />to find something there?
3849300 3850985 What's 21 out of 42?
3851300 3854365 Twenty-one again.<br />Half of 42. Forty-two what?
3854800 3857453 How many players are on the Yankees ball club?<br />Twenty-five.
3857803 3859152 What else is 21?
3859304 3860533 Blackjack.
3861009 3862814 It's a club. It's a wild goose chase,
3862815 3863887 is what it is.
3868200 3869612 Where's the nearest A train?
3870500 3871656 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3872400 3874051 You know, some kid might find that.
3876175 3877082 You're right.
3883544 3885638 Come back here!<br />You little sons of bitches!
3886159 3888475 Hey, you! I remember you!
3890500 3892114 Hey, hey, hey. Where're you going?<br />Come here.
3892116 3894761 What are you doing? What are you doing?<br />Let me go! Let me go, dick-head.
3895000 3896093 Watch your mouth.
3896500 3899051 You wanna go down to juvenile hall<br />for a Butterfinger? Is that it?
3899770 3902409 Look around, man.<br />All the cops are into something.
3902800 3904800 It's Christmas.<br />You could steal City Hall.
3912200 3913900 Come on. Let's go. Come on.<br />My bike.
3914208 3916408 Yo, that's my bike!<br />Yeah. It's Christmas.
3916500 3918060 Hey, hey, hey!<br />Where're you going?
3918062 3920888 Yankee Stadium's that way!<br />That's my bike, you asshole!
3927400 3930033 Why don't you just run over everybody<br />in the whole street?
3930354 3931288 McClane,
3931889 3933098 what the fuck are we doing<br />back down here?
3933100 3934056 Let me ask you something.
3934378 3935990 What is it that Wall Street doesn't have?
3936085 3937866 What, is this stuff catching?<br />You're talking in riddles.
3937868 3938768 No, no. Stay with me.
3938770 3940474 What is it that Wall Street does not have?
3940476 3941592 What?<br />Schools.
3941944 3943600 And what is it they have a shitload of?
3943904 3944769 What?
3953217 3954596 I'll be back in a minute.
3955050 3956600 What am I supposed to do with this?
3958500 3959983 Give it to those guys over there.
3960400 3961408 He's here.
3961800 3963700 Perhaps you could be<br />a little more specific.
3963759 3965082 McClane is here.
3965810 3967595 He's walking toward the bank.
3969200 3971317 And the black man is coming toward me.
3971900 3973706 Oh, now that's a pity.
3974806 3977200 And after we've gone to all<br />that trouble at the stadium.
3977232 3979500 Simon, kill him.
3979700 3982200 Stop toying with him and kill him now.
3983304 3984712 Ok. So be it.
3985705 3987074 May he rest in peace.
3987390 3990259 I'll inform Karl in the lobby.
3990900 3992716 You pack up your team<br />and get out of there.
3992763 3993474 And this one?
3995000 3995911 Officer.
3999100 4001600 Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm afraid<br />I'm gonna need an answer on that issue.
4007100 4008251 Let him go.
4008467 4009393 Understood.
4009394 4010418 Yes, sir?
4010982 4013318 John McClane, says to give you this.
4015100 4017085 Wait, wait. Jesus, don't open it.<br />It's a bomb.
4017800 4019059 Another?<br />Yeah.
4019559 4020278 I see...
4020811 4022149 Oh, we'll take care of that.
4022400 4024941 We better move now.<br />Sir, thank you so much for your assistance.
4025078 4026913 We really appreciate it.<br />Thank you.
4047400 4048008 Hey!
4048803 4050630 Do you leaving this place unguarded?
4072000 4072862 How ya doing?
4073322 4073986 Alright.
4074700 4076909 John McClane. NYPD.
4077500 4078542 Are you alright?
4079596 4080643 Yeah.
4080974 4082085 It's laundry day.
4083165 4084764 What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
4085506 4087502 Has it been quiet like this<br />all morning here?
4088200 4089872 Well...<br />Except for that big explosion
4089873 4091012 a couple of hours ago.
4091505 4094192 I mean, have you seen anything strange<br />happen in the last hour or so?
4094800 4095514 No.
4095667 4098329 And we've had cops in here<br />pretty steady since the subway thing.
4098336 4099192 Yeah.
4100058 4102759 We were just gonna make a round on<br />the vault floor, if you wanna tag along.
4103059 4105459 Sure. Yeah. I think I will.
4105900 4107694 Now, what do you think of this heat<br />this late in the year?
4108300 4109643 Indian summer?
4110100 4113455 Yeah, it feels like, it's gonna rain<br />like dogs and cats later.
4113600 4114795 Here's one of your guys.
4114796 4116109 Detective...
4116110 4117424 Otto, isn't it?
4118000 4119107 John McClane.
4122600 4124300 Hey, Mike. How ya doing?
4126600 4129782 I keep telling myself I'm gonna<br />take the stairs just for the exercise.
4130600 4132146 And on a hot day like this.
4132674 4135110 But it seems like I always end up<br />riding the lift.
4162700 4164315 Hey, what was the lottery number<br />last night?
4164900 4166756 Any of you guys play the lottery?
4166757 4167557 No?
4169098 4170972 My wife buys me two tickets every week.
4171400 4173468 For the last ten years,<br />plays the same two numbers all the time.
4173470 4175697 I said, Honey, why don't you play<br />a different number?
4175699 4176605 She goes, well...
4176746 4178159 those are my lucky numbers.
4178161 4179371 I got the tickets right here.
4183378 4184695 Put that fucking gun down!
4184763 4186239 Put that fucking gun down now!
4192868 4193922 Put it down!
4200300 4201612 Hello!
4202500 4204388 Anybody down here?
4215146 4215926 Put your hands up!
4215927 4217159 Put your fucking hands up now!<br />No, no, no!
4217161 4219561 No, no, no! John, no!<br />No! God, it's me! It's me!
4222100 4223896 Jesus Christ, you almost<br />gave me a heart attack.
4223897 4224800 You alright?
4225335 4226329 You alright?
4226500 4227937 Yeah, yeah. It's not my blood.
4227938 4228898 What the hell's going on down here?
4228900 4230045 Go take a look in there.
4254000 4255331 Hey, McClane.
4255909 4257363 Where the hell is everybody?
4257754 4259450 Simon fucking says!
4261356 4262878 I should have seen it<br />coming a mile away.
4262880 4264383 This was never about revenge.
4264405 4265822 It's about a goddam heist.
4266155 4267585 What was in the room?
4267729 4268750 This.
4269366 4270498 What is this?
4271361 4273998 Oh, shit! Is this gold?<br />Yeah, it's gold.
4274000 4275397 Damn, this is heavy!
4275398 4277091 They cleaned out a whole room of this?
4277100 4277661 Yeah.
4277663 4279092 You know, that would have taken like a...
4279489 4280538 tank or...
4281274 4282600 A dump truck.
4283605 4285486 Fourteen great big dump trucks.
4285998 4287860 We almost got hit by a dump truck.<br />Shit!
4288400 4290900 Damn. Slow down! Shit!<br />Put that shit down.
4291100 4292149 No fucking way.
4292150 4293240 They ain't gonna let you keep it.
4293242 4295482 Yeah, yeah, we'll see.<br />We're gonna need a car.
4295583 4296379 A car?
4302607 4305760 You know how to hot-wire this thing?<br />Of course I can. I'm an electrician.
4306100 4307608 Only problem is...
4311772 4313201 takes too fucking long.
4326000 4327235 Not on the bridge!
4327236 4329530 Down there, McClane. The FDR.
4333200 4334388 Let's go, let's go. Come on!
4336985 4338262 Oh, shit!<br />What?
4339152 4341500 They shot the phone.<br />Oh, too bad.
4341867 4343608 Come on. What's 21 out of 42?
4343609 4344725 I don't have a clue.
4344727 4345896 Well, what about Yankee stadium?
4345922 4348330 We'll get there, but that son of a<br />bitch is not getting off of Manhattan.
4348700 4350500 Move!<br />Jesus Christ!
4350605 4352200 Who do you think you are, lady,<br />Hillary Clinton?
4352400 4354100 That's it! Hillary Clinton.<br />What?
4354219 4355399 The 42nd president.
4355400 4356900 No. She'd be the 43rd president.
4356984 4358936 Alright, alright, but who's the 21st?
4360899 4362154 I don't know.<br />You don't know?
4362156 4363300 No, I don't know! Do you know?
4363400 4364583 No!<br />Well?
4365600 4367235 What kind of engine does this piece<br />of shit have?
4367237 4368463 Come on, step on it!<br />It's a Yugo.
4368476 4370055 It's built for economy, not speed.
4373500 4375635 John what are you doing?<br />I'm gonna get us another phone.
4379200 4380539 Wait, wait, wait!<br />Wait, wait, wait!
4381364 4383349 Hey, who was the 21st president?
4383350 4384757 Go fuck yourself!
4387300 4388417 That guy was pissed.
4388542 4390385 He'll feel better when<br />he looks in the back seat.
4391200 4393100 Oh, shit.<br />That was my gold bar!
4393300 4395577 This is McClane.<br />Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.
4396000 4397470 John, where the hell are you?
4397471 4399305 Walter, it's not a revenge.<br />It's a heist.
4399307 4399967 What?
4399969 4402790 There's gold in the Federal Reserve,<br />and they took a shitload of it.
4403051 4404668 They're headed north in dump trucks.
4404669 4406279 Have you been drinking, McClane?
4406685 4408351 No, not since this morning.
4408612 4411784 Listen. There's a line of dump trucks<br />northbound on the FDR at about 70th.
4411800 4414500 You got to close the bridge and get some<br />helicopters over there right away.
4414680 4416929 I couldn't close a hot dog stand<br />right now.
4416947 4419747 I'm spread all over hell.<br />What about this damn bomb?
4419853 4422698 Find out who the 21st president was.<br />It's got something to do with this.
4422700 4424400 John! John, the 21st what?
4424500 4425418 Walter!
4425419 4428300 Shit! Goddam cellular fucking phones!
4428700 4430400 Get hold of Munson in Triborough.<br />Inspector.
4430532 4433154 Tell him to close all the East River<br />bridges north of 59th Street.
4433684 4435600 Looking for dump trucks.<br />Dump trucks?
4435900 4437134 McClane says,
4437317 4439820 there are dump trucks headed<br />up the FDR loaded with gold.
4439900 4443271 Walter, they don't allow<br />dump trucks on the FDR!
4443300 4444463 Connie!<br />Alright.
4444465 4445560 You don't want I should argue.
4445562 4447754 I won't argue, no matter how stupid it is.
4448100 4450900 K-9, bring it around to the back.<br />Check out the boiler room.
4451098 4452495 Find anything, Charlie?
4453130 4456351 I could spend a week in here with<br />an X-ray machine and still not find it.
4456500 4458683 You don't have a week, Charlie.<br />You got five more minutes.
4458685 4459874 Then we're moving up to 86th Street.
4459900 4461571 We're going as fast as we can.
4462258 4463345 What's up?
4463966 4467194 McClane was mentioning something<br />about the Federal Reserve Building.
4467700 4470092 Isn't that right near that Wall<br />Street bomb site we just left?
4470094 4470773 Yeah.
4477500 4479512 <i>How long do you want us to stay here?</i>
4479900 4482226 The men at the stadium.<br />Stay or go?
4482500 4484360 Karl should have checked in by now.
4484900 4485844 Moment.
4494100 4495157 Come on. Come on.
4497500 4498571 Stay where you are.
4498743 4500280 McClane may still turn up.
4501900 4503895 Relax, Targo.<br />If he is still alive...
4505604 4507270 he won't be talking to anyone.
4508221 4509521 It's the next turn-off.
4511100 4513200 Hi. It's Elvis Duran.<br />You're on the air. What's up?
4513400 4516005 <i>First of all, I just wanna tell you<br />what a great show you got.</i>
4516535 4517934 <i>I listen to you all the time.</i>
4518153 4519594 Thank you. Thank you. What<br />do you wanna talk about?
4519670 4522570 <i>Well, you know all those cop cars<br />screaming around everywhere?</i>
4522736 4523896 <i>You know what they're up to?</i>
4523941 4526153 There's a bomb in a school.
4526681 4527747 <i>My cousin's a cop.</i>
4528148 4530118 Here you go, my dear.<br /><i>Somebody put a big bomb</i>
4530119 4531093 <i>in a school somewhere.</i>
4531144 4533274 7-5...<br /><i>Only they don't know which one.</i>
4533800 4535565 2-0-7...<br /><i>So they're searching all of them.</i>
4535593 4536582 10-2...
4536753 4539046 <i>Every school in the metropolitan area.</i>
4539131 4540574 Holy shit.
4541400 4542700 Doris!<br />Annie?
4542722 4544411 Doris, can you get a hold<br />of my wife?
4545300 4546311 Turley!
4546312 4549559 Half the goddam city just called 9-1-1!
4552300 4554000 They're gone.<br />What?
4554200 4556300 They're gone!<br />Who is this guy, Houdini?
4556400 4557106 Shit!

4560500 4561798 This thing got air bags?
4561799 4563706 Your side does.<br />I don't know about my...
4565300 4567100 McClane!
4587200 4589000 In the truck, let me see the hands.
4590500 4592200 Put them on the door!
4596300 4598440 Don't kill me!<br />Don't shoot me!
4600417 4602384 You a truck driver?<br />No, I'm a beautician.
4602386 4603800 Of course I'm a truck driver!
4605837 4608280 Where are you taking this truck?<br />The aqueduct.
4609300 4611102 What are you taking a dump truck<br />to the race track for?
4611114 4614294 No, the aqueduct. The aque...<br />The water aqueduct!
4614906 4615825 Aqueduct?
4618500 4619194 See?
4619601 4622425 Goes from here all the way<br />up to the Catskill Mountains.
4622983 4625428 What does?<br />That! The water pipe!
4625433 4627533 Goes for about 60 miles.
4634572 4636066 Hey, you the foreman?<br />Yeah.
4636098 4637236 NYPD.
4637827 4640780 You had any, like, extra dump trucks come<br />through here in the last couple of minutes?
4640785 4642394 I'm gonna write those fucking clowns up.
4642396 4644794 They better start paying attention to work<br />orders or we're gonna kick some butt.
4644796 4645997 Who? Who are you talking about?
4645999 4648010 The dozen idiots who tore ass up the tube!
4648500 4650928 We're not loading up there any more.<br />We're loading over here.
4651600 4653476 So much for bridges and helicopters.
4653900 4655998 You got a map that shows me<br />where this tunnel goes?
4656000 4657191 Yeah. Right here.
4659555 4663250 We run pretty much up under the Saw<br />Mill till you get up to the Coffer Dam.
4663500 4666200 From there on, we've already brought<br />the water down from the reservoir.
4666500 4668118 Anybody get in or outta there?
4668144 4670523 Yeah. There's a vent shaft<br />every two miles.
4670525 4672600 No. I mean with a truck.<br />At the Coffer Dam.
4672602 4673891 You can get a truck in there.
4673892 4675031 You can get there on the surface.
4675033 4677134 Just follow the Saw Mill<br />River Parkway up there.
4677135 4678204 It's about 20 miles.
4678206 4680128 Alright. I'm gonna meet you<br />right there, alright?
4680628 4682291 Wait, wait!<br />What am I supposed to do?
4682391 4685209 You're gonna go up to Yankee Stadium.<br />McClane!
4685211 4687228 Go! Get outta here.<br />We got less than two hours.
4687284 4688590 Goddam it!
4694300 4696500 Hey! Is something wrong?
4696800 4699357 480 yards of rock moved so far.
4699400 4701300 Now, that's ten times the Hoover Dam.
4701456 4705400 Right now, there is 516 feet of rock<br />above our heads.
4705700 4708300 This part is phase three of tunnel three.
4708600 4711500 Planning for it began back in 1954,
4711700 4714400 but construction didn't begin till June of 1970.
4714600 4717000 You know what the most interesting part<br />of tunnel three is?
4717200 4719893 What's that, Jerry?<br />The valves. Each one...
4726500 4729780 A big departure<br />from tunnels one and two.
4731200 4732291 Come on!
4732762 4734731 What a hell of a place to break down.
4734733 4737357 Hold it a minute, Jerry.<br />Let me have your hard hat.
4737700 4738664 You got a jacket?
4738665 4739629 Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.
4740500 4741765 Wait here a minute.
4742800 4744750 Wait until he gets alongside the door.
4745870 4746907 Hey, fellas.
4746908 4748800 Mickey O'Brian, aqueduct security.
4749100 4752321 Hey, listen. We got a report of a guy<br />coming through here with eight reindeer.
4759896 4761145 Yeah, they said he was a...
4761704 4764264 jolly, old, fat guy with a snowy-white beard.
4764700 4766900 Cute little red and white suit.<br />I'm surprised you didn't see him.
4770900 4772957 What is it with you guys<br />and these phones?
4774800 4776244 This'll give me something.
4777400 4779712 Holy shit! Is that guy dead?
4780700 4781680 Yes, Jerry.
4782361 4784265 I'm afraid he is.<br />Jesus Christ.
4784900 4787900 Yeah. I want you to get a hold<br />of a guy named Cobb.
4788100 4789003 Walter Cobb.
4789004 4790364 C-O-B-B.
4790365 4791853 He's the head of my police unit.
4792000 4793519 Get him down here. Find him.
4793520 4795300 Tell him you were with John McClane.
4795600 4798314 Tell him to find out who<br />the 21st president was.
4798340 4799705 Chester A. Arthur.
4800456 4801186 What?
4801187 4804159 Chester A. Arthur. 1881 to 1885.
4804200 4806307 Nominated vice president in 1880.
4806342 4808909 Did you know he was the collector<br />of customs right here in New York?
4809700 4811478 No, I didn't know that, Jerry.
4812000 4813337 Take care of yourself.
4868103 4869403 Yes or no?
4870418 4871490 He move.
4877900 4880723 TV's got us. TV's got us.<br />We got to release these traffic guys.
4880815 4882853 No. Traffic jams<br />we can take care of later.
4882861 4884376 You find out what the hell<br />is wrong with this thing!
4884378 4885825 Frequencies are jammed.<br />What about Ricky?
4885826 4887100 I don't know.<br />I can't get a hold of him.
4887300 4889378 But Walter, Federal Reserve.<br />Yeah?
4889500 4891548 Biggest gold storage in the world.
4894200 4895585 You get a unit back down there.
4895694 4897662 Find Ricky. Find out what<br />the hell is going on.
4897669 4898974 Walter!<br />Yeah?
4899100 4900408 You got to hear this.
4904900 4907000 Christ, I thought we were<br />going in the back way.
4907129 4908810 This is the back way, Walter.
4910100 4912913 In half an hour, you're gonna have<br />a riot at every school in this city.
4919600 4922367 We'll start at the top floor.<br />Put 20 men on each floor.
4922369 4924768 Send the other 50 men<br />down to the basement with us.
4924907 4926369 What about McClane? Not a word.
4926377 4927885 I'm getting nothing.<br />Busy signals.
4927887 4929578 Westchester's probably<br />worse than we are.
4929586 4931694 This is kinda putting all our eggs<br />in one basket, isn't it?
4931724 4933020 I mean, what if McClane's wrong?
4933022 4933987 Walter?<br />Yeah?
4934000 4936665 This is Principal Martinez.<br />Principal Martinez, Inspector Cobb.
4936801 4939056 How do you do, Inspector?<br />How do you do, Principal Martinez?
4939228 4940591 I don't want to alarm your children.
4940789 4943825 I wonder if you could move them all<br />into the auditorium and keep them calm.
4962500 4963704 We are coming to the dam.
4963942 4965399 You can call the rear guard.
4971026 4973100 Rear guard, you can close up now.
4974867 4977500 We've reached the dam.<br />You can come up now.
4979100 4981303 Nils, you can close in now.
4983000 4983765 Nils!
4984203 4986492 Attention, attention.<br />Nils is dead.
4986600 4988804 <i>I repeat, Nils is dead fuck-head.</i>
4988805 4989993 <i>So is his pal.</i>
4990100 4992673 <i>And those four guys<br />from the East German all-stars,</i>
4992787 4994487 <i>your boys down at the bank</i>
4994500 4996057 they're gonna be a little late.
4996474 4997588 John.
4999279 5003976 In the back of the truck you're driving,<br />there is $13 billion worth in gold bullion.
5004945 5007043 I wonder, would a deal<br />be out of the question?
5007069 5008499 <i>Yeah, I got a deal for ya.</i>
5008695 5012100 Crawl out from under that rock you're hiding<br />under and I'll drive this truck up your ass.
5013500 5014620 How colorful.
5020900 5023000 I told you not to toy with him.
5023136 5024936 Thank you. That's very helpful.
5028500 5031016 You've jeopardized the mission<br />and the contract.
5033900 5035700 We are vulnerable till we reach the ship.
5035806 5037281 I'm going to put an end to this.
5040083 5040986 Stop!
5044500 5046514 Targo! Targo!
5046600 5047872 Here! Come here!
5050100 5051475 We blow the dam.<br />What?
5052200 5053313 We drown him.
5065700 5066741 Walter!
5067200 5068127 Take a look at this.
5068353 5071363 The janitor said this one was delivered<br />this morning about 10:30, right?
5073262 5074191 Not hooked up.
5074193 5076693 Yeah? Ok. Now take a look at the front.
5080300 5082400 We drill the hinges.<br />Get everybody out.
5233570 5234415 McClane!
5237400 5238987 McClane!<br />Where are you?
5239078 5240209 Over here!
5240800 5243468 You got a hell of a way<br />of flagging somebody down!
5243616 5244481 You alright?
5244482 5245877 Did you go to Yankee Stadium?
5245900 5248408 Yeah! There's nobody there!<br />You didn't see nobody?
5248415 5249018 No!
5249324 5250653 Nobody was following you?
5250655 5252494 I'm telling you.<br />He's jerking us around.
5253217 5254922 Oh, shit! Jesus!<br />Come on! Come on!
5254986 5256555 Oh, no! I didn't see nobody.
5256600 5257761 Nobody's following us.
5257831 5258988 Go, go, go!
5264190 5265392 It's not rigged.
5265658 5266533 Pull it.
5278100 5278753 Well,
5279348 5281616 I'd say you could call off your search.
5282100 5284300 Can you stop it?<br />I should not even touch it.
5284500 5287040 Who knows what kind of booby<br />traps this thing's got.
5288022 5288998 What about the code?
5289198 5290098 No word.
5290558 5291630 When do we evacuate?
5291896 5294097 Simon says he sees one kid<br />leave the building, boom!
5294099 5297212 Fine. There's a chance that somebody's<br />still watching but we can't stand here
5297214 5300084 with our thumb up our ass waiting<br />for this freaking thing to blow up!
5300086 5300942 Ok.
5306998 5308199 Shit! Shit!
5308215 5309488 Get your head down!
5309490 5311992 Come on, Zeus, hold it steady!<br />Hold it steady!
5317200 5318598 Go! Go!<br />Outta the way!
5318600 5320289 Go around him!<br />Go around him!
5332998 5334766 I found out who's the 21st president.
5334768 5336585 Who?<br />Some guy named Arthur.
5337182 5339297 Chester A. Arthur?<br />Chester A. Arthur. That's it. Yeah.

5366680 5367259 Hi, kids!
5367261 5370123 I know you usually have<br />assembly on Fridays,
5370124 5371313 but today is special.
5371400 5374100 Mr Lambert here<br />is from the fire department,
5374324 5378134 and today he wants us to practice<br />a brand-new fire drill.
5378211 5380272 So, I want you to divide in half,
5380273 5382037 and I want half of you to go over here.
5382200 5383340 Teachers will help them,<br />Open the door.
5383366 5385425 And line up against the wall.
5385506 5387507 The other half will go in this direction.
5387508 5390676 Please do it very quietly<br />and very quickly.
5390824 5393824 Alright? Everybody up, please.<br />Teachers, please help them.
5394000 5395246 Fire drill, my ass.
5395247 5397100 That guy ain't from the fire department.
5397500 5399513 Maybe it's because of the radio.
5399740 5401477 You mean, like, they're after us?
5401478 5402400 Nah.
5402900 5404658 Tony squealed on us.
5404659 5405800 No, he didn't.
5405922 5406747 Come on.
5408377 5409443 Well, where you going?
5412200 5413363 Let me drive! Let me drive!
5413364 5414500 Go, go, go!
5414723 5415789 Goddam it!
5418400 5419890 Why the hell didn't you tell me before?
5419891 5421398 Of course he put the bomb up<br />in that school.
5421400 5422316 Why would he do that?
5422318 5424077 Make sure he got<br />your complete attention.
5428500 5430588 Jesus! Jesus!<br />Find the fuse panel.
5430678 5432178 What?<br />The fuse panel.
5432181 5434070 Where's the fuse panel to this car?<br />It's right here! It's right here!
5434151 5436478 Pull out the anti-lock brakes fuse.<br />Shit, I don't know which one it is.
5436480 5437846 Well, then yank them all out then.
5439000 5439740 There.
5439766 5441525 Put your head down.<br />Put your head fucking down.
5441559 5443260 This is gonna be really bad.
5443700 5444534 Listen to me.
5444921 5446412 Hang the fuck on, alright?
5473643 5475042 What the fuck happened?
5476492 5478025 You got a triple-A card?
5478027 5479317 Keep moving.<br />Excuse me.
5479341 5480396 Keep moving.
5480559 5483079 I got the janitors making a last sweep<br />of the building right now.
5483081 5484720 Thank you, Miss Martinez.
5502200 5503083 Come on.
5504928 5507453 Alright, five stud, three nines, one...
5507535 5509094 Stay down! Stay low!
5519037 5520012 Oh, man!
5523946 5525961 What the fuck are you doing?<br />Interrogating him.
5526000 5527700 Well, what's he gonna tell you,<br />I'm dead?
5527795 5529700 Well, I ain't gonna know<br />till I ask him, am I?
5529970 5532554 Go around and see if there is<br />any aspirins in that glove box.
5534400 5535787 No way. You do it.
5541900 5543215 Ten quarters.
5544300 5547285 The guy in the dump truck<br />had ten quarters. Exactly ten quarters.
5547287 5549260 Well, maybe they were making<br />long distance phone calls.
5550043 5550974 No.
5552200 5553361 For the bridge.
5553629 5555229 What?<br />It's for the toll on the bridge.
5557400 5559492 There! There!<br />Down on the wharf.
5559700 5561679 Dump trucks.<br />Right there! Right there!
5564400 5566367 Christ, they got it loaded<br />on a ship already.
5568800 5569504 Shit!
5570098 5571289 How about the Coast Guard?
5571461 5573135 It'd take them an hour to get here.<br />Shit!
5573300 5574203 Shit!
5575373 5576296 We can jump.
5576398 5577032 What?
5577346 5578085 We can jump.
5578093 5580000 Outta your fucking mind!<br />It's 100 feet down to the deck!
5580200 5583116 But not to the crane, it isn't.<br />The cables would cut you in half.
5584800 5586500 I can make it.<br />Bullshit. Get down.
5586582 5588582 Get down. Look in the back<br />of that car for some gloves.
5592930 5595454 Six booby traps, four dead ends.
5596000 5598600 And a partridge in a pear tree
5603000 5604562 Ok, honey.
5605800 5607005 Let's dance.
5607263 5608588 We're gonna have sort of a race.
5608589 5611176 So when I say go,<br />I want you all to run like crazy.
5611178 5613532 All of you. You follow<br />the police officer and the fireman.
5613670 5615205 You guys are my front runners, ok?
5615700 5616425 Walter?
5617051 5618083 Think we're cutting this a little thin?
5618085 5619779 No, Joe. We're gonna wait.
5619780 5621402 McClane still may get the code.
5624000 5625188 Line me up with that crane!
5625189 5626800 There. There.<br />Right there. Right there.
5626830 5628931 Alright. Now I see it.<br />I see it. Now I see it.
5630653 5631181 Shit.
5631182 5633146 This is gonna take a miracle.<br />Keep your fingers crossed.
5633195 5634252 Swing it. Swing it.
5635627 5637542 Come on. You almost got it.<br />Almost. Almost.
5637759 5638907 Yeah!<br />Alright.
5639444 5641400 Where are you going?<br />What, are you in a hurry?
5641600 5643200 I'm going first this time, alright?
5644462 5645938 We have the intercom rigged, sir.
5647500 5649005 <i>Walter, the kids may be fine,</i>
5649006 5651647 <i>but you wait much longer<br />and I'm gonna pee in my pants.</i>
5651805 5653233 We're gonna wait, Connie.
5654900 5655959 Six more minutes.
5671000 5672700 Yo, McClane.<br />What?
5672702 5673607 Down there.
5683800 5684563 Oh, shit.
5684564 5686700 Go, go, man! Go, go, go!
5714018 5714867 Boy.
5715800 5718204 Am I glad you talked me outta jumping.
5744607 5745436 Fuck.
5746700 5747898 Get his feet.
5788546 5789660 We go find Simon
5789820 5791498 and drag him to the ship-to-shore radio
5791500 5793135 and beat that fucking code out of him.
5793137 5794087 Here. Take this.
5794767 5795624 How's it work?
5795700 5796941 You don't know how to shoot a gun?
5796967 5799762 Look, all brothers don't know how to<br />shoot guns, you racist motherfucker.
5799890 5800691 Sue me.
5800999 5802723 Just yank back on that<br />and pull the trigger.
5803566 5804254 That's it.
5804256 5805591 That's it?<br />That's it.
5805592 5806919 Just don't shoot yourself.
5808053 5808660 Hey,
5809037 5811158 don't be no hero.<br />You find him, you come get me.
5828800 5830158 Hey, Katya!
5838000 5840300 Stupid. Stupid.
5882700 5884197 You have the autopilot set?
5884198 5885190 Yes, sir.
5885659 5886408 Good.
5891937 5893893 Don't fucking move.
5900887 5901946 The Samaritan.
5902110 5903440 Gve me the goddam code.
5903441 5904339 Code?
5906600 5907746 You mean for the school.
5908705 5910171 I'm sorry. I can't do that.
5910300 5912475 You call in that code right now...
5912700 5915600 or I blow your sick ass into the next world.
5917283 5918783 If that's what you got to do.
5932064 5933387 You got to take the safety catch off.
5934749 5935482 God...
5935869 5936956 damn!<br />See. That works.
5937107 5937641 Suck.
5937784 5938878 Now where's McClane?
5956500 5957457 What was that?

6040700 6041826 I'm gonna fucking...
6053400 6055287 I knew it was bullshit.<br />There's nobody watching.
6055700 6056900 Time to get Charlie out.
6057700 6058536 Let's move, Charles.
6058537 6059138 <i>Time's up.</i>
6059729 6061112 Give me another 30 seconds.
6061200 6063200 <i>Takes a minute-15<br />if you're a kid, Charlie.</i>
6063300 6065813 And last I looked, you weren't too light<br />on your feet. Now move!
6067000 6069076 Up here! Help us!<br />Oh, my God!
6069344 6070606 Up here! Come on!
6070607 6071600 Look over here!

6076800 6077529 Hey!
6079106 6080517 Any one marked four!
6081600 6082573 What's going on, Walter?
6083600 6085349 <i>We still have kids in the building.</i>
6091000 6091960 I'm staying.
6092282 6094019 <i>No, Charlie. Get outta there.</i>
6095805 6098620 You ever see that show<br />called The Addams Family?
6098800 6101175 They got a motherfucker on there<br />called Lurch.
6101700 6103800 You don't think I'm gonna let you<br />get to that gun, do you?

6173044 6175037 Mayday, mayday.<br />Bridgeport Coast Guard.
6175397 6176807 Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.
6189900 6191093 Come on, kids.
6196200 6197616 Shit, it's too far!
6197617 6198800 Over here. Down.
6205400 6206700 No guts, no glory.
6207877 6210072 There's a big black-and-white fucking<br />boat in the middle of the harbor.
6210140 6212340 <i>Please stay on the line.</i><br />Yeah, sure. I'll stay on the line.
6230900 6232494 Pancake syrup?
6238200 6239661 Hello, John McClane.
6241470 6243470 There was never any bomb<br />in the school, was there?
6243927 6245013 Of course not.
6246100 6247954 I'm a soldier, not a monster.
6248800 6250887 Even though I sometimes work<br />for monsters.
6252000 6254800 No. The real bomb is on this ship.
6259200 6260351 Coast Guard.
6261900 6263524 I was telling them where the boat was.
6265288 6266386 Game over.
6267200 6268406 Not quite over.
6270400 6272293 Bridgeport Coast Guard.<br />Come in, please.
6273700 6275150 They put you on hold?
6276600 6278067 She told me to stay on the line.
6282800 6284470 Oh, God, I love this country.
6284775 6286517 You know, your<br />brother was an asshole.
6288832 6290589 Yeah, he really was an asshole.<br />He was...
6290591 6292584 He was an asshole.<br />You, you got his number.
6292698 6293136 Ok.
6294441 6295242 Yeah.
6297300 6298234 Forgive me.
6298917 6300641 Would you help Mr McClane below?
6302400 6303737 Careful now.
6305900 6306642 Now,
6306967 6308551 do you have the communique?
6309500 6311554 Bridgeport radio come in, please.<br />Bridgeport.
6311734 6313434 <i>Coast Guard.</i><br />Are you there, dear?
6313499 6314374 <i>Yes, we're here.</i>
6314554 6316056 Do you have the ability to record...
6316466 6317378 a message?
6317600 6319057 <i>Yes.</i><br />Then please begin now.
6319700 6320454 <i>Right.</i>
6326200 6328631 <i>This is a communique from the CRF.</i>
6329000 6332700 <i>For too long, the West has conspired<br />to steal the wealth of the world,</i>
6333000 6336330 <i>consigning the balance of humanity<br />to economic starvation.</i>
6336800 6339500 <i>Today, we will level the playing field.</i>
6339800 6343135 <i>In a few minutes, the contents<br />of the Federal Reserve Bank,</i>
6343556 6345700 <i>the gold your economies are built on,</i>
6346000 6348700 <i>will be redistributed by explosive</i>
6349000 6350878 <i>across the bottom<br />of the Long Island Sound.</i>
6352600 6354429 <i>If you are not in gridlock,</i>
6354430 6356278 <i>I invite you to come and watch.</i>
6361000 6362877 You're gonna blow it all up?
6362878 6364157 That's the idea.
6364300 6366151 There are some gentlemen<br />in the Middle East,
6366153 6368603 who seem to think that they'll make<br />a great deal of money.
6369200 6372372 See the men safely off the ship, and<br />I'll see you in the port-side launch.
6373968 6376121 The hell's all this<br />got to do with killing McClane?
6378100 6379981 Life has its little bonuses.
6380595 6382895 Didn't I hear you say<br />you didn't even like your brother?
6382900 6385166 There's a difference, you know,<br />between not liking one's brother,
6385200 6388769 and not caring when some dumb Irish<br />flatfoot drops him out of a window.
6389000 6390955 Hey, I didn't even know<br />that motherfucker!
6391100 6393312 Yes, and I never invited you<br />aboard this ship.
6393500 6395098 No riddle is gonna stop<br />this motherfucker?
6395100 6397916 No code, no riddle,<br />no fancy little countdown.
6398200 6399262 Hey, fuck-head.
6400078 6401700 Yeah, you. Fuck-head.
6403400 6404998 There's just one thing I got to know.
6406821 6408093 You got any aspirins?
6408511 6411162 I've had a bad fucking<br />headache all day long.
6414524 6416087 Must be your lucky day.
6417800 6418800 Keep the bottle.
6431754 6433454 Where is the gold?
6436100 6437555 He's betrayed us.
6438300 6440140 The containers are filled with that.
6469548 6470497 Ok, go faster.
6473449 6476021 If I hadn't have saved your fucking ass,<br />I would not be sitting here with you
6476023 6478493 about to blow up with $100 billion<br />in fucking gold!
6478600 6479928 Yeah, well, I got some bad news.
6479929 6481198 You're only gonna blow up with me.
6481200 6482900 What?<br />There's no gold on this boat.
6483000 6483944 How do you know that?
6483945 6485700 Because I know the man,<br />I know the family.
6486100 6489003 The only thing better than blowing up<br />$100 billion with the gold,
6489696 6490925 is making people think you did.
6490927 6491917 Yeah? Well, where is it?
6492175 6494129 I don't know. He must have switched<br />it back on the dock somewhere.
6494200 6496000 Oh, yeah.<br />That's supposed to make me feel better?
6496137 6496737 No.
6497248 6499225 You're wrong about the other thing, though.<br />You're not gonna die.
6499400 6502491 Yeah, you know some cop trick about<br />handcuffs that's gonna get us outta this?
6502600 6503880 Yeah. Use a key.
6505432 6507948 You know how to pick this lock?<br />Is this some black shit again?
6507950 6510783 Will you stop with that racial shit?<br />Are you a fucking locksmith or not?
6510785 6513100 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do it<br />if I had something to do it with.
6513300 6515276 How about a splinter<br />of that cable I slid down?
6515351 6516168 That might work.
6519400 6521020 Hold on.<br />Fuck are you doing?
6525588 6527206 Fuck! Shit!
6527564 6528840 How's that? That big enough?
6529000 6531000 Shit. Yeah.<br />Yeah, that might work.
6531200 6533665 Alright. Then I'm gonna drop it<br />in your hands. Cup your hands.
6534603 6536629 Don't drop this motherfucker, alright?
6536641 6537916 Get it right. Come on.<br />You ready?
6537917 6539396 One. Ready?
6539574 6540266 Two.
6540594 6541546 Spit it.
6542011 6542716 Yeah!
6542959 6544504 Get it?<br />Come on. Come on. Move your hands.
6545408 6546398 Alright. Ok.
6547922 6549954 Damn, McClane. You know,<br />I was just starting to like you.
6550400 6551962 Yeah? Well, don't.<br />I'm an asshole.
6552234 6553619 What are you talking about now?
6554100 6555483 I lied to you, Zeus.
6555484 6556423 About what?
6557200 6558270 You remember I said.
6558418 6560211 Weiss found that bomb up in Harlem?
6560215 6560928 Yeah.
6560929 6562098 They found it down in Chinatown.
6562658 6565095 Now that's low, even for a white<br />motherfucker like you.
6565220 6566652 I told you I was an asshole.
6567700 6569047 What the fuck was that?
6570000 6571055 I don't know.
6572500 6574630 Look, it was the only way<br />I could get you to come with me.
6575704 6576930 You got a wife, McClane?
6577100 6577680 Yeah.
6578048 6580384 I'm surprised anybody'd stay with<br />you long enough to be married.
6580408 6583408 Yeah. Well, she didn't stick around<br />too long. We're sorta separated.
6583600 6585100 What the fuck is sorta separated?
6585200 6588000 Well, she was in L.A, I was in New York.
6588300 6590052 Had a fight on the phone.<br />She hung up.
6590470 6591800 I didn't call her back.
6592100 6593364 How long ago was that?
6594190 6595494 About a year ago now.
6599200 6600816 What the fuck are you laughing about?
6602000 6605600 You threw away your marriage because you were<br />too fucking stupid to pick up the phone?
6605900 6608417 What, you think that's funny?<br />You laugh at other people's misfortunes?
6608419 6610144 I bet you blame that shit<br />on your wife too, right?
6610146 6612146 Well, my wife is a very<br />stubborn woman, yes.
6615381 6617600 You better stop fucking laughing<br />and undo these cuffs.
6617900 6619379 I'm almost there!
6620100 6621930 There! How's that for concentration?
6622013 6623051 Oh, shit!<br />What?
6623417 6624745 Fuck! I dropped the thing!
6624760 6626401 Dropped the fucking thing?<br />Goddam it!
6627300 6628734 Shit! Where is it?<br />Where did it go?
6628756 6629901 Find it. Find it, alright?
6629903 6631205 I don't fucking see it.
6633467 6634592 What the fuck is that?
6636300 6637656 I think I made it mad.
6639488 6641119 Just go, McClane.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
6641121 6643606 Gotta fucking do something!<br />Goddam it, McClane! Listen to me!
6645500 6647098 Just go.
6648000 6650898 Have a hard enough time getting through the day<br />without having your death on my conscience, man.
6650900 6652500 Shut the fuck up and think, alright?
6652525 6653791 Ok, ok.<br />Tools. Tools.
6653809 6655305 Check the engine room.<br />There's no time!
6657200 6659072 What the hell's it doing now?<br />It's mixing.

6747968 6749131 Got a bad headache.
6749800 6751014 Think they're mad at me?
6751015 6752400 I would not worry about them.
6752600 6753813 They'll get to you eventually,
6753814 6756137 but right now they're busy with<br />this salvage operation, I guess.
6756200 6758091 No! Dre... Dredges!
6758369 6759343 Dredges!
6759598 6761498 They're just wasting their time.<br />There's no gold out there.

6763800 6764895 He beat me.
6765483 6767000 John, he beat all of us.
6767300 6768604 He wasn't playing against you.
6768605 6769800 Fuck that, McClane.
