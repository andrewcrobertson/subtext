975542 978945 How long before?<br />Ten seconds, two minutes.
979012 981014 It could be anything.
981081 984051 But once it's mixed,<br />be somewhere else.

2478276 2481112 now that you mention it,<br />I have experienced a--
2481179 2483915 you know, like a burning<br />sensation between my toes.
2483982 2487786 I thought it was just some<br />athlete's foot or something.<br />I don't know.
2490055 2493291 We read your jacket,<br />Lieutenant. We were told<br />you would be cooperative.
2493358 2495761 Cooperate with what?<br />Hey, now wait a minute.<br />He will be.

2506104 2509708 Hey, I know as much<br />as you know. All right?
2509775 2512410 There's a guy out there<br />setting off bombs.
2512477 2515914 He calls himself Simon.<br />He speaks with a German accent.
2515981 2518884 And for some reason,<br />he's very angry with me.
2518950 2521987 Now, maybe you can tell me<br />why, fellas. Huh?
2527192 2530361 The first man there<br />is Methias Targo.
2530428 2533364 Was Hungarian army.<br />Explosives expert.
2533431 2535601 Now we believe<br />he's working for the Iranians.<br />Working?

2540138 2542641 [ Cobb ] Who's the girl?<br />[ Cross ]<br />Targo's other half.
2542708 2546477 Rumor is Israelis slipped<br />a bomb in between their sheets.<br />Uh, he wasn't at home,
2546544 2548614 but they think<br />maybe they got her.
2548680 2552751 [ Jarvis ]<br />The second man was an obscure<br />colonel in the East German Army.
2552818 2556788 He ran an infiltration unit.<br />The kind of thing the Nazis did<br />at the Battle of the Bulge.
2556855 2558857 English-speaking troops--
2558924 2561559 Yeah, yeah,<br />I saw the movie.
2561627 2566698 All we know of him is<br />the G.D.R. medical records<br />show he suffers from migraines.
2566765 2569668 His name is Peter Krieg.
2572137 2575607 Well, that is<br />an exceptional report,<br />fellas.
2575674 2578576 Now, do you want to tell me<br />what the hell this<br />has to do with me?
2578644 2581146 The name Gruber mean<br />anything to you, Lieutenant?
2585516 2587819 It rings a bell, yeah.
2587886 2589921 L.A.<br />[ Cobb ]<br />What?
2589988 2592357 That thing in<br />the building in L.A.
2594192 2596261 Peter Krieg...
2596327 2600331 was born Simon Peter Gruber.
2600398 2604670 He's Hans Gruber's brother.

2609741 2612878 Yeah, it's that thing<br />in L.A.
2612944 2615847 We figure he's got you<br />fitted up for a toe tag,
2615914 2618950 and he's gonna do anything<br />to get it tied.
2619017 2622053 Inspector!<br />Inspector, it's him.
2624022 2625991 Don't let him know<br />we're here.
2628559 2632163 Simon.<br />[ Simon ]<br />Inspector.
2632230 2635233 Now, who from the F.B.I.<br />is in the van, I wonder?

2638503 2640405 Hello.
2640471 2643809 And I know you never run alone,<br />so say hello, Bill.

2646978 2649014 [ Simon Snickering ]
2649080 2653785 This, gentlemen, as they say,<br />is where the plot thickens.
2653852 2657588 I have put<br />2,400 pounds of explosive<br />in one of the 1,446 schools...
2657655 2659691 in greater New York.
2659758 2664029 It is fitted with<br />a timer set to explode<br />at exactly 3:00 p.m.
2665330 2667966 Thank you. Your silence<br />says I'm understood.
2668033 2670769 [ Cobb ]<br />Did you say 2,400 pounds?
2670836 2673004 [ Simon ]<br />Yes, but please don't<br />interrupt again!
2673071 2676141 Simon says, if you attempt<br />to evacuate schools,
2676207 2678176 the bomb will be detonated<br />by radio.
2678243 2680478 And, gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.
2680545 2684750 Repeat, one school will be<br />dismissed at 3:00 p.m.<br />permanently, unless--
2684816 2686852 Unless what?
2686918 2689520 Unless John McClane<br />and his new best friend<br />complete the tasks I set them.

2698730 2701499 Twenty minutes.<br />Go by foot. No rush.
2701566 2705703 If you're really clever, you'll<br />learn the location of the bomb<br />and the code to disarm it.
2705771 2707973 Oh, and by the way, gentlemen,
2708039 2711042 we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.
2711109 2715947 The only problem is the<br />darn things seem to respond to<br />police and F.B.I. frequencies.
2716014 2718984 So if I were you,<br />I'd keep off your radios.
2719050 2721486 Simon, wait.<br />[ Dial Tone ]
2725156 2728193 2,400 pounds<br />of that liquid stuff.
2728259 2731696 My God.<br />Get me the commissioner.
2731763 2734465 [ Woman ] He's doing a<br />press conference. He's supposed<br />to be here in half an hour.
2734532 2738069 Ricky, get every<br />senior officer on the site.<br />Get 'em here right away.
2738136 2740772 You're not gonna give me<br />any jurisdictional nonsense<br />on this?
2740839 2745076 I got two kids<br />in the school on 64th Street.<br />What can I do to help you?
2745143 2747378 How many men have you got?<br />Seventy-five.
2747445 2749915 But if I push the panic button,<br />I can get 500 from Washington.
2749981 2752517 - When?<br />- 2:30, 3:00.
2752583 2754485 Between now and then--
2754552 2758957 We're gonna have to do this<br />all by ourselves. Let's go.
2759024 2762493 Now, Tompkins Square Park<br />is more than two miles away,<br />so you guys better get running.
2762560 2765163 No radios.<br />You take my telephone.
2765230 2768433 You get anything, you call<br />me through the switchboard.<br />Good luck.
2768499 2771269 Thanks.<br />Find that bomb.
2771336 2774039 Ricky, where are they?<br />Right over here.
2774105 2776507 The senior man present<br />is Chief Allen.<br />Chief of what?
2776574 2778877 Transit.<br />Okay, thanks, Ricky.
2778944 2781813 Gentlemen, we have<br />a decision to make.<br />Chief Allen.
2781880 2784482 The man who has done this<br />has told us...
2784549 2789554 that he has planted another<br />very large bomb in a school<br />here in the New York area.
2789620 2794059 And he has told us that we<br />cannot evacuate, but he has not<br />said that we cannot search.
2794125 2796995 Now, I recommend<br />we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody--
2797062 2801232 I'm talking about police,<br />transit, sanitation, fire,<br />even the goddamn librarians--
2801299 2805370 and we start searching schools,<br />and I mean right now.
2805436 2808073 I'm talking about<br />1,000 buildings<br />within the city limits.
2808139 2810675 And we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it in.
2810741 2813778 Now, I'd like to keep the media<br />out of this as long as possible,
2813845 2816547 because if they get in,<br />we've got a panic.
2816614 2818583 Are we in agreement?

6326253 6329457 [ Simon's Voice ]<br />This is a communiqué<br />from the C.R.F.
6329524 6333294 For too long, the West<br />has conspired to steal<br />the wealth of the world,
6333361 6336598 consigning<br />the balance of humanity<br />to economic starvation.
6336664 6339901 Today, we will level<br />the playing field.
6339967 6342937 In a few minutes, the contents<br />of the Federal Reserve Bank,
6343004 6346273 the gold your economies<br />are built of,
6346340 6350912 will be redistributed<br />by explosive across the bottom<br />of the Long Island Sound.
6352714 6356083 If you are not in gridlock,<br />I invite you to come and watch.
6361055 6364158 You're gonna<br />blow it all up?<br />[ Simon ] That's the idea.
6364225 6366694 There are some gentlemen<br />in the Middle East<br />who seem to think...
6366761 6369163 that they'll make<br />a great deal of money.
6369230 6374001 See the men safely off the ship,<br />and I'll see you in<br />the port-side launch.
6374068 6378105 [ Zeus ]<br />What the hell's all this<br />got to do with killin' McClane?
6378172 6380074 Life has its little bonuses.
6380141 6383210 Didn't I hear you say you<br />didn't even like your brother?
6383277 6386013 There's a difference<br />between not liking<br />one's brother and not caring...
6386080 6388750 when some dumb Irish flatfoot<br />drops him out of a window.
6388816 6390885 Hey, I didn't even know<br />that motherfucker!
6390952 6393054 Yes, and I never invited you<br />aboard the ship.
6393120 6395022 [ Zeus ]<br />No riddle is gonna stop<br />this motherfucker?
6395089 6398526 No code, no riddle,<br />no fancy little countdown.
6398593 6401796 Hey, fuck-head.<br />Yeah, you, fuck-head.
6403465 6406067 There's just one thing<br />I gotta know.

6408736 6411739 I've had a bad fuckin'<br />headache all day long.

6481075 6483377 What?<br />There's no gold<br />on this boat.
6483444 6486113 How do you know that?<br />'Cause I know the man,<br />I know the family.
6486180 6488716 The only thing better<br />than blowin' up $100 billion<br />worth of gold...
6488783 6491018 is makin' people<br />think you did.
6491085 6494221 Well, where is it?<br />He must've have switched it<br />back on the dock somewhere.
6494288 6497391 Oh, yeah. That's supposed<br />to make me feel better?<br />No.
6497458 6499661 You're wrong about<br />the other thing, though.<br />You're not gonna die.
6499727 6502630 You know some cop trick<br />about handcuffs that's gonna<br />get us outta this?
6502697 6505099 Yeah, use a key.
6505166 6508135 You know how to pick<br />this lock?<br />Is this some black shit again?
6508202 6511172 Will you stop with<br />that racial shit? Are you<br />a fuckin' locksmith or not?
6511238 6514508 Yeah, yeah, I can do it if<br />I had somethin' to do it with.<br />How 'bout a splinter...
