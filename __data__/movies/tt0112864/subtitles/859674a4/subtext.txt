197598 200499 Noncompliance will<br />result in a penalty.

202603 205663 Another big bang<br />in a very public place.
208609 211510 What is it that you want<br />Lieutenant McClane to do?
211612 213512 Simon says<br />Lieutenant McClane
213614 217015 is to go to the corner of 138th Street<br />und Amsterdam,

915148 918049 A nut who knows<br />a lot about bombs.
918151 919982 We found this<br />in a playground.
920086 921986 Professional.<br />Very cool stuff.
922088 923487 You know, boom.
923590 926491 Think you should slam it around<br />like that, Charlie?
926593 928220 It's unmixed.<br />Can't hurt it.
928328 930888 This stuff is cutting edge,<br />a binary liquid.
930997 932055 A what?
932165 933792 Like epoxy.
933900 935367 Two liquids.
935468 938562 Either one<br />by itself...
940073 941506 you got nothing.
941608 943337 But mix them...
954587 955815 Ricky.
959192 960284 Aah!
960393 963191 Charlie, you'll be wearing that chair<br />up your ass!
963296 965127 Christ almighty, Charlie!
965231 967131 Like I said,<br />very cool stuff.
967233 968632 With a package<br />like this,
968735 969963 you get a warning.
970069 971969 The bomb<br />has to arm itself.
972071 974471 The red liquid<br />pumps into the clear
974574 975802 before it detonates.
975909 977308 How long before?
977410 979207 10 seconds, 2 minutes.
979312 980711 Could be anything.
980813 982940 But once it's mixed...
983049 984311 be somewhere else.
984417 986817 This stuff has got<br />to be pretty rare.
986920 989650 Find out if any of it's<br />missing someplace.
989756 991986 Livermore labs--<br />theft over the weekend.
992091 994355 Got enough to make<br />another one, Joe?
994460 996291 About 2,000 pounds.
996396 997624 Of that?
997730 999789 The detonating mechanism<br />can be anything--
999899 1001127 radio, electrical.
1001234 1004135 You could use a beeper<br />and phone it in.
1004237 1005295 Inspector!<br />It's him.
1005405 1007635 He's got a feedback<br />loop on it.
1007740 1008968 A nasty<br />little trick--
1009075 1010508 Charlie. Charlie.
1010610 1011668 What?
1011778 1013712 Want to start the trace?
1021187 1023087 Simon.
1023189 1026420 He bought a board, walked the street,<br />and survived.
1026526 1027925 [ Speaking German ]
1028027 1029927 Where are my pigeons now?
1030029 1031758 Pigeons?
1031864 1034264 I had two pigeons,<br />bright and gay,
1034367 1035766 fly from me the other day.
1035868 1037563 Why was it<br />that they did go?
1037670 1039228 You cannot tell.<br />You do not know.
1039339 1040897 You mean McClane.
1041007 1043567 No. I mean Santa Claus.
1045511 1046910 Yeah, I'm here.
1047013 1048412 Ah. There after all.
1048514 1049913 And your friend?
1050016 1052746 Come on.<br />We need you in the other room.
1052852 1054251 Let's go. Come on.
1054354 1056254 They need you. Go.
1056356 1057653 Yeah, he's here, too.
1057757 1059190 May I speak with him?
1061127 1063527 Well, is the ebony samaritan<br />there now?
1063630 1065530 You got a problem<br />with ebony?
1065632 1067532 No, no. My only problem is
1067634 1069534 that I went<br />to some trouble
1069636 1071035 preparing that game<br />for McClane.
1071137 1073367 You interfered<br />with a well-laid plan.
1073473 1075532 You can stick<br />your well-laid plan
1075642 1076973 up your well-laid ass.
1077076 1079476 [ Dial Tone ]
1079579 1080978 That was not smart.
1081080 1083310 There are lives<br />at stake here.
1083416 1085043 Not enough time,<br />Inspector.
1085151 1087312 You better hope<br />he calls back.
1087420 1088944 He will.
1089055 1090215 [ Chattering Outside ]
1090323 1091551 Ricky, tell those people
1091658 1094252 to shut the hell up<br />out there!
1094360 1095759 Hey! Keep it down here!

1105271 1107000 Simon.
1107106 1109336 He wasn't speaking<br />for all of us.
1109442 1110670 That was unpleasant.
1110777 1112176 Don't let it<br />happen again.
1112278 1114007 So what's your name,<br />boy?
1114113 1115512 Don't call me boy.
1115615 1118846 I'm sorry.<br />It was a poor attempt at humor.
1118951 1121351 I would send you home<br />with a chiding,
1121454 1123684 but now I think<br />you should join the game.
1123790 1126054 We got him.<br />A pay phone in Oslo.
1126159 1127456 Wait. They say it's Mexico.
1127560 1128458 Norway?
1128561 1130791 Now they're saying<br />it's Juarez, Mexico.
1130897 1131921 Forget it.
1132031 1133430 He's scrambling up<br />the system.
1133533 1134966 They don't know<br />where he is.
1135068 1137901 Having fun with the phone company,<br />are we?
1138004 1140234 Simon says McClane<br />and the samaritan
1140340 1142240 will go to<br />the subway station
1142342 1143570 at 72nd and Broadway.
1143676 1145576 I'll call you<br />in 15 minutes
1145678 1147908 on the pay phone<br />outside the station.
1148014 1149106 No police.
1149215 1151274 Failure to answer will constitute<br />noncompliance.
1151384 1153614 Do you understand me, John?
1153720 1155278 Oh, yes, I understand.
1155388 1157288 I understand<br />you're a fucking wacko
1157390 1159290 who likes to play<br />kid's games.
1159392 1160290 Hardly.
1160393 1161360 Hardly?
1161461 1163861 Then who are you,<br />somebody I sent up?
1163963 1167023 What did you do, shoplifting,<br />purse snatching...
1167133 1168361 cross-dressing, what?
1168468 1170368 You c-c-couldn't<br />catch me
1170470 1173530 if I stole your ch-chair<br />with you in it.
1173639 1176369 My ch-ch-chair<br />with me in it?
1176476 1178876 Let me ask you<br />a question, bonehead--
1178978 1181378 Why are you trying<br />to k-k-k-kill me?
1181481 1183210 John, John,<br />calm yourself.
1183316 1185216 Why don't you<br />come down here
1185318 1187878 and we'll figure this out<br />like men?
1187987 1190217 If killing you<br />was all I wanted,
1190323 1191722 you'd be dead by now.
1191824 1193382 Simon, this is Inspector Cobb.
1193493 1195723 I can appreciate your feelings<br />for McClane,
1195828 1198228 but believe me,<br />the jerk isn't worth it.
1198331 1201232 He stepped on so many toes<br />in this department,
1201334 1203564 next month he'll be<br />a security guard.
1203669 1206069 His wife wants nothing<br />to do with him,
1206172 1209073 and he's two steps shy<br />of becoming an alcoholic.
1209175 1211507 One step, one step.
1211611 1213340 Now listen to me.
1213446 1215846 You sound like a real smart guy.
1215948 1217506 What is it you want?
1217617 1219517 Are you talking<br />about money?
1219619 1222179 Well, whatever, whatever.
1222288 1224381 McClane is a toilet bug.
1224490 1226219 Now what would it take
1226325 1229226 just to forget him<br />and live happily ever after?
1229328 1230727 Money is shit to me.
1230830 1232730 I would not give up McClane
1232832 1235232 for all the gold<br />in your Fort Knox.
1235334 1238098 72nd Street subway, pay phone,<br />15 minutes.
1238204 1239603 McClane and the samaritan.
1239705 1241605 If you're competent<br />in the least,
1241707 1242935 you've found the briefcase,
1243042 1246443 so you know what<br />I mean by penalty.
1246546 1247877 [ Dial Tone ]
1247980 1250881 I want to thank you for that vote<br />of confidence.
1250983 1253213 I thought it was<br />worth a try.
1253319 1254786 This guy's a raving maniac.
1254887 1256286 He couldn't be any clearer.
1256389 1258949 He gave you clues<br />to his identity,
1259058 1260286 he spoke German,
1260393 1262452 he called it<br />your Fort Knox,
1262562 1264962 and he stammered when McClane<br />pushed him.
1265064 1267760 You believe this guy<br />really can't be bought?
1267867 1270768 The very mention of money only<br />enraged him further.
1278711 1280110 What's that?
1280213 1282113 It's your shield.
1282215 1285116 You asking me<br />to be a cop again?
1285218 1286776 Ricky, get him his gun.
1286886 1288615 Hey!

1316415 1317382 I didn't.
1317483 1318882 I stopped a white cop
1318985 1320384 from getting killed in Harlem.

1355254 1356585 Yeah. That's in Harlem.

1368367 1370426 Cheer up. Things could be worse.

1625724 1628818 The number three train<br />is arriving now.
1628928 1632329 I left something provocative<br />on that train, John.

1652718 1656620 90 blocks in 30 minutes<br />in New York traffic?
1656722 1658314 It could be double that.
1658424 1660824 We don't even have a car!
1660926 1662985 Hey, hey, sir!<br />I'm a cop.
1663095 1665655 I'm requisitioning this car<br />for official police business.
1665764 1667561 Thanks very much. Get in.
1667666 1670066 Pretty slick.<br />I used to drive a cab.
1670169 1672399 The fastest way south is--aah!

1680679 1683580 I was saying<br />I used to drive a cab,
1683682 1686082 and 9th Avenue is<br />the fastest way south.
1686185 1688176 We seem to be going east.

1693592 1695457 Where the hell<br />are you going?
1695561 1696926 9th Avenue's<br />the quickest way--

1701333 1703995 They're headed east<br />on 72nd towards the park.
1704103 1705331 Wall Street is south!
1705437 1707337 Stop yelling.<br />I got a headache.
1707439 1709839 The best way south<br />is not 9th.
1709942 1711500 It's through the park.
1711610 1713373 Oh, dear.
1714813 1717077 I told you Park Drive's<br />always jammed.
1717182 1718945 I didn't say Park Drive.

2482681 2484114 between my toes.
2484215 2486615 I thought it was just some<br />athlete's foot
2486718 2487946 or something.
2489688 2491588 We read your jacket,<br />Lieutenant.
2491690 2494591 We were told you<br />would be cooperative.
2494693 2496092 Cooperate with what?

2497696 2499163 You want to share<br />information,

2509474 2512375 There's a guy out there<br />setting off bombs.
2512477 2513876 He calls himself Simon.
2513978 2516310 He speaks with<br />a German accent.
2516414 2519144 For some reason,<br />he's very angry with me.
2519250 2522151 Maybe you can tell me why,<br />fellas, huh?
2527158 2529854 The first man there<br />is Mathias Targo.
2529961 2532054 Was Hungarian army,<br />explosives expert.
2532163 2534563 Now we believe he's working<br />for the Iranians.
2534666 2535564 Working?
2535667 2536861 Freelance terrorism,
2536968 2538697 by contract.

2540672 2542071 Targo's other half.
2542173 2544573 Rumor is the Israelis<br />slipped a bomb
2544676 2545574 in between their sheets.
2545677 2546701 He wasn't at home,
2546811 2548711 but they think they got her.
2548813 2551213 The second man<br />was an obscure colonel
2551316 2553216 in the East German army.
2553318 2554580 Ran an infiltration unit,
2554686 2558087 the thing the Nazis did<br />at the Battle of the Bulge--

2559524 2560752 I saw the movie.

2610175 2612575 Yeah. It's that thing in L.A.
2612677 2616078 We figured he's got you fitted up<br />for a toe tag,

2642407 2643806 so say hello, Bill.
2643908 2646809 Still trying to butch up<br />by chewing on your glasses?
2646911 2648538 Ha ha ha ha.
2648646 2651046 This, gentlemen, as they say,
2651149 2654175 is where the plot thickens.
2654285 2656685 I have put 2,400 pounds<br />of explosives
2656788 2659689 in one of the 1,446 schools<br />in greater New York.
2659791 2661691 It is fitted with a timer
2661793 2664694 set to explode<br />at exactly 3 p.m.
2664796 2666661 Thank you.
2666764 2668561 Your silence says<br />I'm understood.
2668666 2671066 Did you say<br />2,400 pounds?
2671169 2673069 Yes, but please<br />don't interrupt again.
2673171 2676504 Simon says, if you attempt<br />to evacuate schools,
2676608 2679008 the bomb will be detonated<br />by radio.
2679110 2681010 Gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.
2681112 2684013 Repeat, one school<br />will be dismissed at 3 p.m.
2684115 2685013 permanently, unless--
2685116 2686344 Unless what?
2686451 2688578 Unless John McClane<br />and his new best friend
2688686 2690586 complete the tasks<br />I set them.
2690688 2692553 John, are you listening?
2694158 2695750 Yeah.
2695860 2697691 There's a pay phone<br />beyond Hope,
2697795 2698693 Tompkins Square Park.
2698796 2701390 20 minutes, go by foot.<br />No rush.
2701499 2703194 If you're really clever,
2703301 2705997 you'll learn the location of the bomb<br />and the disarming code.
2706104 2707628 By the way, gentlemen,
2707739 2711038 we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.
2711142 2712541 The only problem is
2712644 2715545 the darn things respond<br />to police and FBI frequencies.
2715647 2719344 If I were you,<br />I'd keep off your radios.

2754385 2757218 we're going to have to<br />do this all by ourselves.

2759390 2761790 Tompkins Square Park<br />is more than 2 miles away.

2778376 2779274 Thanks, Ricky.
2779377 2781777 Gentlemen,<br />we have a decision to make.
2781879 2784279 Chief Allen,<br />the man who has done this
2784382 2787283 has told us he's planted<br />a very large bomb
2787385 2789285 in a New York school.
2789387 2791287 He's told us<br />we cannot evacuate,
2791389 2794256 but he has not said<br />we cannot search.
2794359 2797260 I recommend we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody--

2800365 2801764 even the goddamn<br />librarians--
2801866 2803561 and we start<br />searching schools,
2803668 2805295 and I mean right now.
2805403 2807803 I'm talking about<br />a thousand buildings,
2807905 2810999 and we have 3 hours and 15 minutes<br />to do it.
2811109 2814010 I'd like to keep the media<br />out of this
2814112 2816945 because if they get in,<br />we've got a panic.

3723913 3725141 Asshole! How's that? Asshole!
3725248 3727580 You got some fucking problem<br />because I'm white?
3727684 3728912 Have I oppressed you?
3729018 3731350 Have I oppressed<br />your people somehow?
3731454 3734355 You don't like me<br />'cause you're a racist!
3734457 3735583 What?
3735692 3737922 You don't like me<br />'cause I'm white!

3788578 3790409 You surprise me again,<br />John.
3790513 3793038 This is becoming<br />an ugly habit.

3798821 3801722 On the contrary,<br />you have lots of time.
3801824 3803849 You have...
3803960 3807361 2 hours and 47 minutes<br />precisely.

3819575 3822476 The road to truth<br />has many turns.
3822578 3826480 You'll find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3826582 3828982 When you undertake<br />the trip it suggests,
3829085 3830484 ask yourself<br />this question--
3830586 3834249 What is 21 out of 42?
3836159 3837319 We're behind.
3837427 3839622 We should abandon<br />the rest and go.
3839729 3842197 Relax, Targo.<br />There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3842298 3846701 He's sending us to the home team dugout<br />at Yankee Stadium.
3846803 3849203 We supposed to find<br />something there?
3849305 3851136 What's 21 out of 42?
3851240 3853140 21 again.<br />Half of 42.
3853242 3854174 42 what?
3854277 3857144 How many players<br />on the Yankees ball club?
3857246 3858144 25.
3858247 3859646 What else is 21?
3859749 3860647 Blackjack.
3860750 3861648 It's a club.
3861751 3864652 It's a wild goose chase<br />is what it is.
3867957 3870357 Where's the nearest<br />''A'' train?
3870460 3871859 Wait, wait, wait, wait.
3871961 3875795 You know,<br />some kid might find that.
3875898 3877388 You're right.

4088944 4090377 Except for<br />that big explosion
4090479 4091878 a couple of hours ago.
4091981 4094347 Seen anything strange<br />happen in the last hour?
4094450 4097351 No. We've had cops<br />in here pretty steady
4097453 4098852 since the subway thing.

4518907 4520465 Thanks. What's on your mind?
4520576 4522476 Those cop cars speeding<br />around everywhere--
4522578 4523943 you know what<br />they're up to?
4524046 4526412 There's a bomb<br />in a school.
4526515 4527914 My cousin's a cop.
4528016 4531315 Somebody put a big bomb<br />in a school somewhere.
4531420 4533320 Only they don't know<br />which one.

4640729 4642856 I'm writing<br />those fuckin' clowns up!
4642965 4645229 They better start paying attention<br />to work orders.

4649037 4651938 We're not loading up there anymore.<br />We're loading over here.
4652040 4653940 So much for bridges<br />and helicopters.
4654042 4656442 Got a map showing<br />where this tunnel goes?
4656545 4657944 Yeah, right here.
4659047 4661106 We run pretty much<br />up under the saw mill
4661216 4663616 till you get up<br />to the coffer dam.
4663719 4666552 After that, we've already brought<br />the reservoir water down.
4666655 4668919 Any way in or out<br />of there?
4669024 4670958 There's vent shafts<br />every 2 miles.
4671059 4672617 I mean with a truck.
4672728 4675629 At the coffer dam.<br />You can get a truck in there.
4675731 4678495 Follow saw mill parkway up there.<br />It's about 20 miles.
4678600 4680500 I'll meet you right there,<br />O.K.?

4699187 4701587 Now, that's 10 times<br />the Hoover Dam.
4701690 4705182 Right now, there's 560 feet of rock<br />above our head.
4705294 4707922 This part is phase three<br />of tunnel three.
4708030 4710931 Planning for it<br />began back in 1954,
4711033 4713433 But construction didn't begin<br />till June of 1970.
4713535 4716936 You know what the most interesting part<br />of tunnel three is?
4717039 4718267 What's that, Jerry?
4718373 4719931 The valves. Each one...

4759848 4762749 Yeah, they said he was<br />a jolly old fat guy
4762851 4764409 with a snowy white beard.
4764519 4766077 Cute red and white suit.
4766188 4768088 I'm surprised<br />you didn't see him.
4770692 4773092 What's with you guys<br />and these phones?
4774963 4775861 Give me something.

5585039 5586802 I can make it.
5586908 5589877 Get down.<br />Look in the car for some gloves.
5592914 5594541 Six booby traps,
5594649 5596082 four dead ends,
5596184 5598744 # And a partridge<br />in a pear tree ##
5602990 5605390 O.K., honey...
5605493 5607484 let's dance.
5607595 5609392 We're going to have a race.
5609497 5611897 When I say ''go,''<br />run like crazy.
5611999 5614399 Follow the police officer<br />and the firemen.
5614502 5617403 Walter, I think we're cutting this<br />a little thin.
5617505 5619405 No. We're going to wait.
5619507 5621839 McClane still<br />may get the code.
5621943 5624036 [ Horn Blows ]
5624145 5625772 Line me up<br />with that crane.
5625880 5627142 Right there.
5627248 5629011 You're O.K.
5630785 5632753 This will take a miracle.
5632853 5634377 Keep your fingers crossed.
5635489 5637116 You almost got it.
5637225 5639022 Yeah! All right.
5639126 5641594 Where you going?<br />You in a hurry?
5641696 5643288 I'm going first this time.
5643397 5645922 We have the intercom rigged, sir.
5646033 5648433 Walter, the kids may be fine,
5648536 5650128 But you wait much longer
5650238 5651933 and I'll pee<br />in my pants.
5652039 5654030 We're going to wait,<br />Connie.
5654141 5656132 Six more minutes.
5670491 5671458 Yo.
5671559 5672617 McClane.

5715670 5718400 you talked me<br />out of jumping.

5793314 5794713 Here. Take this.
5794815 5796214 How's it work?
5796317 5798683 You don't know how<br />to shoot a gun?
5798786 5801118 All brothers don't know<br />how to shoot guns.
5801222 5804123 Yank back on that,<br />pull the trigger.
5804225 5805283 That's it?
5805393 5806792 Just don't shoot yourself.
5806894 5808794 Hey. Don't be no hero.

5951672 5952661 Nicht schiessen!
5955509 5957443 What was that?
5962016 5964507 He said, ''Don't shoot.''

6040527 6041960 I'm kind of weak.
6052539 6054439 I knew it was bullshit.
6054541 6055940 There's nobody watching.
6056043 6057442 Time to get Charlie out.
6057544 6058636 Time's up.
6058746 6060646 Give me another 30 seconds.

6237858 6240224 Hello, John McClane.
6240327 6243728 There was never<br />any bomb in the school.
6243831 6245423 Of course not.
6245532 6247932 I'm a soldier,<br />not a monster,
6248035 6251368 even though I sometimes<br />work for monsters.
6251471 6252870 No.
6252973 6255373 The real bomb<br />is on this ship.
6258979 6260913 Coast Guard.
6261014 6264882 I was telling them<br />where the boat was.

6282669 6284694 Oh, God,<br />I love this country.
6284805 6287501 You know,<br />your brother was an asshole.
6287608 6289405 He really<br />was an asshole.
6289509 6290908 He was an asshole.
6291011 6292911 You got his number.
6294147 6295409 Yeah, O.K.
6297017 6298450 Forgive me.
6298552 6301419 Would you help<br />Mr. McClane below?
6301521 6302579 Ohh.
6302689 6304850 Careful now.
6304958 6308587 Now, do you have<br />the communique?

6315302 6317702 Will you be able<br />to record a message?
6317804 6318702 Yes.
6318805 6320636 Then please begin now.
6325979 6328379 This is a communiqu�<br />from the CRF.
6328482 6329779 For too long,
6329883 6331282 the West has conspired
6331385 6333615 to steal the wealth<br />of the world,
6333720 6335620 consigning the balance of humanity
6335722 6337781 to economic starvation.
6337891 6340382 Today, we will level<br />the playing field.
6340494 6343258 In minutes, the contents<br />of the federal reserve bank--
6343363 6346491 the gold your economies<br />are built on--
6346600 6348898 will be redistributed<br />by explosive
6349002 6352733 Across the bottom<br />of the Long Island Sound.
6352839 6354898 If you are not<br />in gridlock,
6355008 6356373 come and watch.
6360647 6362911 You going<br />to blow it all up?
6363016 6364415 That's the idea.
6364518 6366418 Some gentlemen<br />in the Middle East
6366520 6368920 think they'll make<br />lots of money.
6369022 6371422 See the men<br />safely off the ship,
6371525 6373925 and I'll see you<br />on the launch.
6374027 6376655 What's this got to do<br />with killing McClane?
6378031 6379931 Life has its little bonuses.
6380033 6382934 Didn't you say you didn't<br />even like your brother?
6383036 6385266 There's a difference<br />between not liking one's brother
6385372 6387772 and not caring when<br />some dumb Irish flatfoot
6387874 6389000 drops him out a window.
6389109 6391134 I didn't even know<br />that motherfucker.
6391244 6393439 I never invited you<br />aboard this ship.
6393547 6395947 No riddle's going to stop<br />this motherfucker?
6396049 6398449 No code, no riddle,<br />no fancy countdown.
6398552 6400349 Hey, fuckhead.
6400454 6402012 Yeah, you--fuckhead.
6402122 6406218 Just one thing<br />I got to know--
6406326 6407953 you got any aspirins?
6408061 6410461 I've had a bad<br />fucking headache
6410564 6411929 all day long.
6414568 6416536 Must be your lucky day.
6418005 6419404 Keep the bottle.
6419506 6420564 Right.
6431918 6433749 Where is the gold?
6435255 6437086 He's betrayed us.
6437190 6440125 The containers<br />are filled with that...
6463717 6465742 [ Speaking German ]
6473727 6476127 If I hadn't saved<br />your fucking ass,
6476229 6479130 I wouldn't be here about to blow up<br />with $100 billion.
6479232 6481632 You're only going<br />to blow up with me.
6481735 6483464 There's no gold<br />on this boat.
6483570 6484969 How do you know?
6485072 6486471 I know the family.
6486573 6489474 Only thing better than blowing up<br />$100 billion
6489576 6491407 is making people<br />think you did.
6491511 6492910 Well, where is it?
6493013 6494913 He must have<br />switched it somewhere.
6495015 6497415 That supposed to make me<br />feel better?
6497517 6498575 You're wrong.
6498685 6500084 You're not<br />going to die.
6500187 6503088 You know some cop trick<br />about handcuffs to get us out?
6503190 6504589 Yeah. Use a key.
6504691 6506921 You know how<br />to pick this lock?
6507027 6509427 Is this some<br />black shit again?
6509529 6511929 Are you a fucking locksmith<br />or not?
6512032 6514432 I need something<br />to do it with.
6514534 6516934 How about a splinter<br />of that cable?
6519372 6520430 Hold on.
6520540 6522940 What the fuck<br />are you doing?
6523043 6525170 Uh!
6525278 6527109 Fuck! Shit!
6527214 6529114 How's that?<br />that big enough?
6529216 6530615 Yeah. That might work.
6530717 6533117 I'm going to drop it<br />in your hand.
6533220 6534619 Cup your hand.
6534721 6536120 Don't drop<br />this motherfucker.
6536223 6538123 Get it in the right.
6538225 6539283 You ready?
6539392 6541826 1... 2... spit it.
6541928 6542986 Yeah!
6543096 6543994 Get it?
6544097 6545359 Move your hands.
6545465 6546955 O.K.
6547067 6548125 Damn, McClane,
6548235 6550567 I was just starting<br />to like you.
6550670 6552069 Don't. I'm an asshole.
6552172 6554072 What are you<br />talking about?
6554174 6555573 I lied to you.
6555675 6556835 About what?
6556943 6560572 Remember I said Weiss<br />found that bomb up in Harlem?
6560680 6563080 They found it<br />down in Chinatown.
6563183 6566584 That's low even for a white<br />motherfucker like you.
6566686 6567812 [ Beep ]
6567921 6569821 What the fuck was that?
6569923 6571322 I don't know.
6571424 6573824 Look, it was the only way
6573927 6576418 to get you to come with me.
6576530 6577997 You got a wife?
6578098 6580430 I'm surprised anybody<br />could stay with you
6580534 6581933 long enough to be married.
6582035 6583434 She didn't stick around.
6583537 6584936 We're sort of separated.
6585038 6587939 She was in L.A.,<br />I was in New York,
6588041 6590441 we had a fight<br />on the phone,
6590544 6593445 she hung up,<br />I didn't call her back.
6593547 6595447 How long ago was that?
6595549 6596948 About a year ago.
6597050 6598278 [ Laughing ]
6598385 6600785 What the fuck<br />you laughing about?
6600887 6602787 You threw away<br />your marriage
6602889 6605289 because you were<br />too fucking stupid
6605392 6607292 to pick up the phone?
6607394 6608793 You think that's funny?
6608895 6611227 I bet you blame your wife, too.
6611331 6614232 My wife is a very stubborn woman.
6614334 6616234 You better stop<br />fucking laughing
6616336 6617735 and undo these cuffs.
6617837 6618826 They're almost...
6618939 6619837 there!
6619940 6621339 How's that<br />for concentration?
6621441 6622408 [ Clatter]
6622509 6623567 Oh, shit!
6623677 6625611 I dropped the pin.
6625712 6627111 Goddamn it!
6627214 6628408 Where'd it go?
6628515 6629504 Find it!
6629616 6631015 I don't see it.
