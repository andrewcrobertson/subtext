114125 116225 Allen, Bomb Squad,<br />Special Services...
116325 118826 State Police and the FBI!
119125 122725 Lieutenant Jurgenson, Upummer! I want<br />you to go to St. John's Emergency...
123025 125325 in case we got any walk-ins<br />from the street.
125525 128025 - Take that down there and get it faxed.<br />- Kramer, get the city engineer!
128225 130425 I gotta find out a damage report.<br />It's very important.
130725 133125 Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want<br />to blow up a department store?
133325 135125 Did you ever see a woman<br />miss a shoe sale?
135425 137625 Connie, I want you to get started<br />on the witness sheet.
137925 141125 Ricky, you and Joe, you make sure<br />the uniforms got it cordoned off there.
141425 144725 And you don't let<br />the damn TV crews in. Benson!
145025 148125 - Inspector, phone.<br />- Not now. Benson! Traffic!
148525 151726 We get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3:00,<br />or we got the traffic jam from hell!
151926 153726 - Walter!<br />- Yeah?
153926 157226 I think you'd better take this.
159326 161426 Major Case Unit,<br />Inspector Cobb.
161626 163626 Said Simple Simon to the pie man<br />going to the fair...
163826 165926 "Give me your pies...
166126 168926 or I'll cave your head in."
169126 172326 You see, Bonwit's was just<br />to make sure I had your attention.
172626 175726 Is there a detective<br />named McClane there?
176026 180726 - He's on suspension.<br />- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.
181026 183626 - Who is this?<br />- Call me Simon.
183926 186826 - What do you want?<br />- I want to play a game.
187026 189826 - What kind of game?<br />- "Simon says."
191526 193926 Simon's going to tell<br />Lt McClane what to do...
194126 197226 and Lt McClane is going to do it.
197626 200726 Noncompliance will result<br />in a penalty.
201026 202726 What penalty?
203026 206126 Another big bang<br />in a very public place.
208726 211526 What is it that you want<br />Lt McClane to do?
211826 214126 Simon says Lt McClane<br />is to go to the corner...
214426 217026 of 138th Street und Amsterdam...
217226 219326 which is in Harlem<br />if I'm not mistaken.
219526 223427 Kowalski! Lambert!<br />Do you know where to find McClane?
223627 225627 Well, I kinda doubt<br />you're gonna find him in church.
225927 229127 Well, you better find out<br />what rock he's under...
229527 230927 and kick it over.
242827 246527 - John.<br />- Thanks.
254027 255927 Gimme some more. Come on.
257527 260427 Jesus, John.<br />You look like shit.
265027 267427 Where did we leave off<br />with that roster?
267627 271127 We got three killings in Red Hook<br />the past two nights.
271527 273627 Put Miner on it.<br />And Genetti.
273827 275727 The mayor's office will call<br />before the day's out.
275927 280227 Next, 14 dump trucks stolen<br />from a yard in Staten Island.
280527 284827 Fourteen! Jesus! Is somebody<br />starting a construction company?
285127 287527 Nah, it was John's landlady<br />going to clean his apartment.
290027 292027 Insurance fraud.
292127 294928 That's a priority<br />out in California.
295228 297228 The contractor splits the money<br />with the thieves.
297428 299928 We had that out in Jersey<br />a couple years ago, Joe. Remember?
300128 303328 See what Kelly can do with it.
303628 305528 Hey, what was the lottery number<br />last night?
305728 307828 - 4667.<br />- 4667.
309828 311628 You still bettin' your badge, Rick?
311828 314428 Yeah, 6991 every week.
316528 318628 6991, lucky number.
318928 321628 Half the cops in New York<br />play their badges.
321928 324828 How're the kids, John?
325128 327728 I hear they're okay.
327928 330228 Did you talk with Holly?
333128 336228 - No, I didn't talk to Holly.<br />- Coming up on it, Inspector.
338228 340328 Is it hot in here,<br />or am I just scared to death?
340528 343828 You wanna make sure<br />the gun's secure?
344128 346128 Yeah, it's good.
353528 356028 You know, you're the first woman<br />since Holly who's seen me do this.
356328 360528 - I'm honoured.<br />- Yeah, so was she.
363928 367029 So, where's the backup gonna be?
370329 373329 We're gonna drop back<br />to 128th Street.
373629 375929 What?
376229 378929 Ten blocks?<br />Are you fucking kidding me?
379129 382529 Oh, man, that's just great! Hey, Walter,<br />what is all this about, huh?
382929 386029 - If we don't do it, this guy says he's<br />gonna blow up another public place.<br />- Well, why me?
386329 390529 - What does it got to do with me?<br />- I have no idea. He just said<br />it had to be you.
392929 395629 It's nice to be needed.
395929 399129 - Frankly, John, you haven't been...<br />- Hey, Walter, how 'bout you mind your<br />fucking business about Holly, huh?
400629 404129 Between you and Simon, you're<br />fucking up a perfectly good hangover.
407429 409229 Okay.
418529 421129 We'll be back to pick you up<br />in 15 minutes.
421429 424529 Take your time.<br />I expect to be dead in four.
425529 428029 Let's go, Billy!
449630 451330 Oh, man.
478330 481230 - Hey, yo, Uncle.<br />- Come look at this.
483130 485130 It's ten after 9:00.<br />Why aren't you in school?
485230 489630 - Tony wants to sell you this.<br />- Tony? That no-neck dude<br />they call Bad T?
490030 491930 He says he found it<br />in a Dumpster.
492130 494530 He keeps stealing from people,<br />they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.
494730 497630 No, he didn't steal it.<br />He says his uncle gave it to him.
497930 500930 Mm-hmm. Hand me<br />that newspaper over there.
503730 505530 Don't ever let people use you.
505830 507631 You're runnin' all over town<br />with stolen property.
507831 509631 If you get caught,<br />you get in trouble...
509831 512031 while he gets to deny<br />the whole thing and walk away.
512331 515431 You... You mean you want us<br />to take it back to Tony?
515631 518831 No, I'll take it back to Tony,<br />with a message.
520131 522531 - Now, where you goin'?<br />- School.
522831 524531 - Why?<br />- To get educated?
524831 526631 - Why?<br />- So we can go to college.
526731 528831 - And why is that important?<br />- To get "espect."
529131 530931 "Respect."<br />And who's the bad guys?
531231 533831 - Guys who sell drugs.<br />- Guys who have guns.
534031 535831 - And who's the good guys?<br />- We're the good guys.
536031 537931 - Who's gonna help you?<br />- Nobody.
538131 540331 - So who's gonna help you?<br />- We're gonna help ourselves.
540631 542931 - And who do we not want to help us?<br />- White people.<br />- White people.
543231 545731 That's right.
545931 549231 Now, get on outta here.<br />Go to school.
553231 555431 - Uncle, you better come look at this.<br />- What?
555631 557631 There's a white man<br />standing in the street.
557831 560531 - I seen one.<br />- Not like this.
570431 572931 Dial 9-1-1. Tell the police<br />to get up here quick.
573331 577931 Somebody's about to get killed. And get<br />your butts to school. You hear me?
578231 580432 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah.<br />- All right.
584432 587432 - I paid 500 bucks...<br />- You better back off, man.
596432 599132 - Hey, man!<br />- He ain't so big.
605932 609332 - Morning.<br />- Good morning.
609632 612932 You having a nice day, sir?<br />You feeling all right?
613232 615032 Not to get too personal...
615332 617132 but a white man standin'<br />in the middle of Harlem...
617332 619632 wearin' a sign that says<br />"I hate niggers"...
619932 621932 has either got some serious<br />personal issues...
622232 624632 or not all his dogs are barkin'.
624832 627332 Hey, I'm talkin' to you!
627532 630132 Now, you got about ten seconds<br />before those guys see you.
630432 633132 When they do, they will kill you.<br />You understand?
633432 637032 You are about to have<br />a very bad day.
637332 640832 Tell me about it.<br />Sir, this is a police matter.
641132 643632 - For your own safety, I'm gonna<br />ask you to step across the street.<br />- You damn right it's a police matter!
643832 646632 For your own safety, I suggest<br />you hide your butt in my shop<br />till the police get here.
646932 649032 What the fuck?
650632 653233 Aw, shit.
660033 661733 - Listen, I'm a cop. I'm on a case.<br />- What?
662033 664233 Somebody blew up<br />Bonwit Teller's an hour ago.<br />Did you hear about that on the news?
664433 666233 - Yeah.<br />- The same asshole that did that said...
666433 668233 I gotta come to Harlem and do this<br />or he's gonna blow up something else.
668333 670133 - Do you understand?<br />- Shit, shit, shit.
670433 672133 - Listen, I got a gun.<br />You should get across the street.<br />- They got ten guns.
672433 674233 - You should get across the street!<br />- Look, start acting crazy, all right?
674433 676733 - What?<br />- Like Looney Tunes.<br />You know, like Bellevue?
677033 681333 - Hey, Zeus, this a friend of yours?<br />- He look like a friend of mine?
681633 685533 I think the dude just escaped from<br />some hospital. You know, like Bellevue?
689933 693933 I am the voice of my own god.
694233 696233 And my god did...
696533 698633 I told the librarian that I had a bad<br />headache, but she didn't believe me.
698833 701533 I really do have a bad headache, though.<br />I have a very bad headache!
701833 705133 - And my head does not feel...<br />- Oh, man, shut the fuck...
705533 707433 - Who in the fuck...<br />- You've made a very bad mistake.<br />- Kick his ass.
707633 710333 - Put it through his head.<br />- Bust his head.
710533 714033 Cut this shit off!<br />Fellas! Fellas!
714333 717533 Nature boy here hates niggers.<br />Now, what are we gonna do about that?
717833 720433 - Fight him!<br />- Yo, yo, yo, yo!<br />Hold up! Hold up! Hold up!
720733 723434 - Oh, shit!<br />- Yeah!
723634 725734 Get him! Get him!
725934 728834 - Back! Back up!<br />- Hey, what you trippin' on?
729034 732234 - Back the fuck up! Now!<br />- Hey, you better quit that, boy!
732634 736034 Come on, man, get up.<br />Get up! Get outta here!
737734 739634 Stop the c...<br />Stop the goddam cab!
739934 742034 - Don't shoot!<br />No, don't shoot me! Don't shoot!<br />- Don't move that cab! Get up!
742334 744134 - Come on, get up!<br />- Yo, you sayin' you gonna kill us?
744334 747934 I mean it! I don't want to, but I will!<br />You know I will! Come on. Drive! Drive!
748234 750734 - Drive! Go! Go! Go! Drive, goddam it!<br />-  Get the fuck outta here!
750934 754034 Drive! Drive!<br />Don't stop! Don't stop!
754434 756734 - Just keep driving!<br />Run the red light! Drive!<br />- Don't shoot me, man! That's all I got!
756934 758734 - That's all I got.<br />- Man, put that fuckin' money away!
758934 760734 - Nobody's robbing you, asshole!<br />- Don't kill me!<br />- Nobody's gonna kill you!
760934 762634 - Shit!<br />- Just run all the lights! Drive!
762934 764834 - Oh, man! Damn!<br />- We got a bus.
765034 766834 - That cut deep?<br />- How the hell would I know?
767034 769134 Just keep pressure on it.
769434 771634 Oh, fuck!
771934 775334 - Jesus, right? John McClane.<br />I owe you one.<br />- Damn right, you owe me!
775634 778434 - You got any idea what those guys<br />are doin' to my shop right now?<br />- Chill out, Jesus!
778734 780534 - We'll send a car for...<br />- "Chill out"? What the fuck?<br />Are you tryin' to relate to me?
780734 782834 - Talk like a white man!<br />- Okay. Jesus, I'm sorry<br />you got involved, all right?
783134 785134 Why do you keep calling me Jesus?<br />I look Puerto Rican to you?
785334 787634 - Guy back there<br />called you Jesus, didn't he?<br />- He didn't say Jesus!
787834 790834 - He said, "Hey, Zeus." My name is Zeus.<br />- Zeus?
791134 794035 Yeah, Zeus! As in father of Apollo!<br />Mount Olympus!
794235 797035 "Don't fuck with me, or I'll shove<br />a lightning bolt up your ass!"
797235 800235 Zeus! You got a problem with that?
800535 803035 - No, I don't have a problem with that.<br />- Shit!
803335 807035 - Downtown. Police Plaza.<br />- That's just great.
812235 813935 Get a record of all his collars,<br />recent releases...
814235 816135 and a list of anybody else<br />he might have looked at sideways.
816435 818535 It's probably as long as your arm,<br />so I'm gonna need some help with it.
818835 821635 It's textbook megalomania.<br />It's a pathological state...
821835 825035 in which fantasies of control<br />or omnipotence predominate.
825335 828835 He wants control over him.<br />He wants control over his actions,<br />over his thoughts, even his emotions.
829035 832635 - Sounds like you got<br />a secret admirer, John.<br />- Yeah, maybe he'll send me some flowers.
832935 836235 - Everybody knows you like pansies.<br />- It's not tha0 kind o- emotion.
836435 838635 - This guy is ugly.<br />- How is that?
838835 841535 Nothin' wrong with him<br />a shower wouldn't cure.
841735 844135 Beer is normally taken<br />internally, John.
844535 847535 - Just get me some aspirins, will ya?<br />- Yeah, okay. Hold this here.
848835 850635 This is Fred Schiller, John,<br />and he's a...
850835 854435 - A shrink. Yeah, I got it.<br />- Yes. I was saying that we're dealing...
854735 857735 with a megalomaniacal personality<br />with possible paranoid schizophrenia.
857935 861935 Hey, hey, how about we just skip down<br />to the part where you tell me what<br />the fuck this has to do with me, huh?
862335 866136 I don't know. I mean,<br />what I do know is it does have<br />specifically to do with you.
866436 869636 This guy wants to pound on you<br />till you crumble.
869936 871736 He wants you to dance<br />to his tune and then...
871936 874836 Put on a dress and fuck me?
875036 877136 I was going to say kill you.
877336 880036 - Pick up five, goddam it!<br />- He's sitting on an awful lot of rage...
880336 883536 and it could be manifested physically<br />if he's stressed.
883936 886036 Somebody he arrested?<br />Somebody he pissed off?
886336 888936 - That could be one hell of a long list.<br />- Fuck you, Joe.
889236 891336 See, these people don't like<br />to work anonymously.
891536 893836 They want you to know<br />who's doing it to you.
894036 895836 So this name "Simon"<br />is probably not an alias.
896136 898336 It's probably "Simon"<br />or some variation.
898636 902436 "Simon, Robert E. Busted in '86,<br />extortion, kidnapping, ten to fifteen.
902736 906036 Did seven years for good behaviour.<br />Released on a state work-furlough<br />two months ago."
906436 908236 - Check it.<br />- Thanks, Rick.
908436 911736 Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman<br />who kidnapped his partner's daughter.
911936 914736 He's a fuckup, not a psycho.<br />The guy we're lookin' for is nuts.
914936 917736 A nut who knows a lot about bombs.
918036 920636 We found this in a playground.<br />Professional!
920936 923836 Very cool stuff.<br />You know, boom!
924036 927836 - You think you should<br />slam it around like that, Charlie?<br />- When it's unmixed, you can't hurt it.
928136 930636 This stuff is cutting edge.<br />It's a binary liquid.
930836 933636 - A what?<br />- Like epoxy.
933836 935636 Two liquids.
935936 938437 Either one by itself...
939937 943137 you got nothin', but mix 'em...
954537 956237 Ricky.
960537 962937 Charlie, you're gonna be wearing<br />that shirt up your ass!
963237 966337 - Christ Almighty, Charlie!<br />- Like I said, very cool stuff.
966637 968937 Now, with a package like this,<br />you get a warning.
969237 971137 Now, the bomb has to arm itself.
971437 975537 You'll see the red liquid<br />pump into the clear before it detonates.
975737 978937 - How long before?<br />- Ten seconds, two minutes.
979237 981037 Could be anything.
981237 984537 But once it's mixed,<br />be somewhere else.
984737 986537 This stuff has gotta be pretty rare.
986737 988537 We oughta be able to find out<br />if any of it's missin' somewhere.
988837 991737 I already did. Livermore Labs<br />theft over the weekend.
992037 994137 He got enough to make<br />another one, Joe?
994337 997337 - About 2,000 pounds.<br />- Of that?
997637 1000837 Well, the detonating mechanism<br />could be anything... radio, electrical.
1001137 1003437 Hell, you could use a beeper<br />and phone it in.
1003737 1007737 - Inspector? Inspector, it's him.<br />- He's got a double Alberti<br />feedback loop on it.
1008037 1010838 - A nasty little trick<br />I believe once used in Lebanon.<br />- Charlie. Charlie!
1011038 1012538 - Charlie, shh!<br />- What?
1012738 1014538 Wanna start the trace?
1021838 1023138 Simon.
1023438 1026338 He wore the board,<br />walked the street and survived.
1027938 1031738 - Where are my pigeons now?<br />- Pigeons?
1031938 1035338 I had two pigeons, bright and gay,<br />fly from me the other day.
1035738 1038938 Why was it they did go?<br />You cannot tell. You do not know.
1039138 1042838 - You mean McClane?<br />- No, I mean Santa Claus.
1045538 1049738 - Yeah, I'm here.<br />- Ah, there after all. And your friend?
1050038 1052538 Carver! Carver! Come on.<br />We need you in the other room.
1052738 1055938 - Let's go! Come on!<br />- They need you. Go.
1056238 1058938 - Yeah, he's here too.<br />- And may I speak with him?
1061238 1063338 Well, is the ebony<br />Samaritan there now?
1063538 1065938 - You got a problem with ebony?<br />- No, no.
1066238 1070238 My only problem is that I went to some<br />trouble preparing that game for McClane.
1070638 1072738 You interfered<br />with a well-laid plan.
1072938 1076938 Yeah? Well, you can stick your<br />well-laid plan up your well-laid ass.
1079538 1083439 That was not smart.<br />There are lives at stake here!
1083739 1087139 - Not enough time, Inspector.<br />- You better hope he calls back.
1087339 1088839 He will.
1091139 1094039 Ricky, you wanna tell those people<br />to shut the hell up out there!
1094239 1097039 Hey, keep it down here!
1105239 1108539 Simon, he wasn't speaking<br />for all of us.
1108839 1112039 That was unpleasant.<br />Don't let it happen again.
1112239 1115339 - So, what's your name, boy?<br />- Don't call me "boy."
1115639 1118839 I'm sorry.<br />It was a poor attempt at humour.
1119039 1121139 I was going to send you home<br />with a chiding...
1121439 1124039 - but now I think perhaps<br />you should join the game.<br />- We got him!
1124239 1126239 It's a pay phone in Oslo.
1126439 1128239 - No, w-wait, they say<br />it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Norway?
1128439 1131039 No, wait. No, wait. N-Now<br />they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.
1131239 1134639 Forget it! Australia?<br />He's scrambling up their system.<br />They don't know where he is.
1135039 1137839 Having fun with<br />the phone company, are we?
1138039 1140739 Simon says,<br />McClane and the Samaritan...
1140939 1143739 will go to the subway station<br />at 72nd and Broadway.
1143939 1147139 I will call you in 15 minutes<br />on the pay phone outside the station.
1147439 1150939 No police. Failure to answer<br />will constitute noncompliance.
1151239 1153540 Do you understand me, John?
1153840 1156840 Oh, yes, I understand. I understand<br />that you're a fuckin' wacko...
1157240 1159240 that likes to play kids games,<br />that's what I understand.
1159440 1161240 - Hardly.<br />- Hardly?
1161340 1164540 Well, then, who are you?<br />Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?
1164840 1168840 Shoplifting? Purse snatching?<br />Cross dressing? What?
1169240 1173340 You c-c-couldn't catch me if I stole<br />your ch-chair with you in it.
1173540 1177240 My ch-ch-ch-chair with me in it?<br />Ooh-hoo! That's very exciting.
1177640 1181340 Let me ask you a question, bonehead.<br />Why are you trying to k-k-k-kill me?
1181640 1184640 - John, John, calm yourself.<br />- Why don't you come on<br />down here to Police Plaza...
1184840 1186640 and we'll figure this out<br />like a couple of men, huh?
1186940 1189840 - Just come on down here.<br />- If killing you was all I wanted...
1190040 1192440 - Simon, this is Inspector Cobb.<br />- you'd be dead by now.
1192640 1195240 I can appreciate your feelings<br />for McClane...
1195440 1198040 but believe me,<br />the jerk isn't worth it.
1198240 1200440 He's stepped on so many toes<br />in this department...
1200640 1203040 by this time next month<br />he's gonna be a security guard.
1203440 1205440 His own wife wants<br />nothing to do with him...
1205540 1208540 and he's about two steps shy<br />of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.
1208940 1211340 One step. One step.
1211540 1213340 Now listen to me.
1213640 1217240 You sound like a real smart guy.<br />What is it that you want?
1217440 1219440 Are you talking about money?
1219640 1222240 Well, whatever, whatever.
1222540 1225041 McClane is a toilet bug.
1225241 1228541 Now what would it take just to forget<br />him and live happily ever after?
1228941 1230741 You know, money is shit to me.
1230941 1235041 I would not give up McClane<br />for all the gold in your Fort Knox.
1235341 1238341 72nd Street subway,<br />pay phone, 15 minutes.
1238541 1240441 McClane and the Samaritan.
1240641 1243141 If you're competent in the least,<br />you've found the briefcase...
1243441 1246241 so you know what I mean by penalty.
1249241 1251241 I wanna thank you for that vote<br />of confidence, Walter.
1251541 1254341 Well, I thought it was worth a try.<br />This guy's a raving maniac.
1254741 1257241 Well, he-he couldn't be any clearer<br />if he got it from a case history.
1257441 1259341 He gave you clues<br />to his identity.
1259641 1262341 He spoke German.<br />He called it "your Fort Knox."
1262641 1264341 And he stammered<br />when McClane pushed him.
1264541 1266541 Now, you believe this guy<br />really can't be bought?
1266741 1270741 There's no chance. The very mention<br />of money only enraged him further.
1278941 1282241 - What's that?<br />- It's your shield.
1282541 1284841 - You askin' me to be<br />a cop again, Walter?<br />- Ricky, get him his gun, all right?
1285141 1288841 - You didn't answer my question. Hey!<br />- Joe, this time they...
1289141 1293541 - You didn't answer my question, Walter.<br />- Are you done, Lieutenant?
1295242 1298342 Now, you two better get going if you're<br />going to get up to 72nd Street on time.
1298642 1301142 - Joe, this time they go with backup.<br />- You got it.
1301342 1303942 - Come on, you guys!<br />- I'm not goin' anywhere.
1304142 1308142 - Simon says you gotta go!<br />- I'm not jumpin' through hoops<br />for some psycho!
1308542 1311042 That's a white man with white problems.<br />You deal with him.
1311242 1316042 - Call me when he crosses 110th Street.<br />- Hey! Why'd you save my ass?
1316342 1320142 I didn't. I stopped a white cop<br />from gettin' killed in Harlem.
1320442 1322242 One white cop gets killed today...
1322542 1325942 tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,<br />all of 'em with itchy trigger fingers.
1326242 1330442 - Got it?<br />- Get him back.
1333042 1335142 - Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?<br />- Chinatown.
1335442 1337342 Shit.
1337442 1340242 Zeus! Yo, partner! Wait up!
1340542 1342342 Hey, hey, hey, hey!<br />I ain't your partner.
1342642 1346142 I ain't your neighbour, your brother<br />or your friend. I'm your total stranger.
1347342 1349442 Okay, stranger...
1349742 1352842 you know where that park is<br />at 115th Street and St Nicholas?
1355542 1359042 - Yeah, it's in Harlem.<br />- Where do you think<br />we found that bomb?
1359342 1364442 Listen, this guy doesn't care<br />about skin colour, even if you do.
1367043 1370643 - What am I doin'?<br />- Cheer up. Things could be worse.
1370943 1373043 I was workin'<br />on a nice, fat suspension...
1373243 1375243 smokin' cigarettes<br />and watchin' Captain Kangaroo.
1376143 1377643 Come on.
1380943 1382743 Is that the phone?
1386643 1388743 Okay, they made it to the phone,<br />but there's a problem.
1388843 1390743 Well, what do you mean?<br />How big a problem?
1391043 1392943 Oh, about 300 pounds.
1393143 1395143 - And they're probably going to end up<br />having to get an operation.<br />- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
1395343 1397143 - We need this phone<br />for official police business.<br />- Do you mind!
1397443 1399143 - Honey, I'm a cop.<br />I need the phone right now.<br />- I'm sorry, but I can no...
1399443 1401743 Get off the damn phone, lady!<br />Police business!
1401943 1404243 - Well, I never!<br />- I can get used to this.
1404443 1407043 I'm sure you can find a phone<br />across the street, ma'am.
1407243 1409843 Let's get something straight.<br />I'm the only one here<br />on official police business.
1410043 1412643 - Don't ever do that shit again.<br />- Let's get somethin' else straight.
1412843 1414943 You need me<br />a lot more than I need you.
1415243 1418043 You don't like the way<br />I do things, fine. I quit.
1421543 1423343 I don't know.
1427043 1429343 All right, I need you.
1434843 1437944 All right, I need you<br />more than you need me.
1442144 1445444 - Hello!<br />- Birds of a feather flock together.<br />So do pigs and swine.
1445844 1448744 Rats and mice have their chance,<br />as will I have mine.
1448944 1450744 Nice. Rhymes.
1451044 1454544 - Why was the phone busy?<br />Who were you calling?<br />- The Psychic Hotline.
1454744 1456544 I'd advise you to take this<br />more seriously.
1456744 1458544 Look, it's a public phone!<br />What do you want me to say?
1458744 1462744 You can simply say<br />there was a fat woman on it, and it<br />took you a minute to get her off!
1464344 1467744 Now, John, there's a significant<br />amount of explosive...
1468144 1469944 in the trash receptacle next to you.
1471744 1474044 Try to run,<br />and it goes up now.
1474344 1476344 Nobody's gonna run, but I got<br />a hundred people out here!
1476644 1480144 That's the point.<br />Now, do I have your attention?
1480544 1482944 As I was going to St Ives,<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1483244 1485744 Every wife had seven sacks.<br />Every sack had seven cats.
1485944 1488344 Every cat had seven kittens.<br />Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.
1488644 1491844 How many were going to St Ives?<br />My phone number is 555...
1492144 1494844 - No, no, no! Wait! I didn't<br />get all that! Say it again!<br />- Not a chance.
1495144 1498144 - My phone number is 555 and the answer.<br />- But I didn't...
1498344 1500544 Call me in 30 seconds or die.
1503644 1506044 - All right,<br />seven guys with seven wives makes...<br />- Shut up, McClane. I'm good at this.
1506444 1509845 - Seven guys with seven wives makes...<br />- Shut the fuck up, McClane!<br />He said seven wives with seven sacks.
1510045 1512445 - Seven times seven is 49.<br />Now tell me the rest.<br />- Seven wives?
1512745 1514745 - A sack with...<br />s-seven sacks with seven...<br />- Weren't you listening?
1515045 1516945 - Yeah, I was listening.<br />I didn't hear every fuckin' thing...<br />- What the heck is wrong with you?
1517145 1519845 - Well, I... Besides having<br />a bad fuckin' hangover, for one thing!<br />- All right, all right, all right.
1520045 1522145 Seven wives times seven, 49.<br />With seven cats.
1522345 1524445 Seven times 49 is 343, right?
1524645 1527945 - What, are you asking me or telling me?<br />- I'm telling you. 343 times seven is...
1528245 1532145 One, zero, 24. 2,401.<br />That's what you got, right?
1532345 1534345 Yeah, that's what I got.<br />Is that it, 2,401?
1534545 1537845 - That's it. Dial. 555-2401.<br />- 555-2401.
1539445 1542245 - No, wait, wait!<br />It's a trick. It's a trick.<br />- What? What? What do you mean?
1542545 1545045 - I forgot about the man.<br />- What man? Fuck the man!<br />We got ten seconds left!
1545345 1547445 He said how many were going<br />to St Ives, right?
1547545 1550845 The riddle begins: As I was going to<br />St Ives, I met a man with seven wives.
1551245 1554045 - The guy and his wives<br />aren't goin' anywhere.<br />- What are they doing?
1554245 1556745 Sittin' in the fuckin' road<br />waitin' on a mo...<br />How the hell should I know, McClane?
1556945 1560245 - Well, who's going to St Ives then?<br />- The guy. Just the guy.
1560645 1562545 - Just one guy? Just one guy.<br />- The answer's one.
1562745 1565245 - How do you dial one?<br />- 555-0001.
1565545 1568245 - Zero, zero, one. Just one guy's going?<br />- Hello, John.
1568445 1570745 Yeah, piece of cake.<br />Give us somethin' harder next time.
1570945 1573545 - But you're ten seconds late.<br />- No, no! The answer is one! The...
1573745 1576245 - Boom!<br />- There's a bomb in the trash! Get down!<br />- Everybody, get down!
1576445 1579545 Get down! There's a bomb!<br />Everybody, get down!
1579845 1582246 There's a bomb!
1582446 1584946 Get down! There's a bomb!
1588046 1590246 - Welcome to New York.<br />- Really.
1592346 1595746 They were just talking.<br />Here, you can have it. Come on.
1595946 1598146 - Come on, let's go.<br />- I'm getting outta here right now.
1606146 1609046 - I told you it wasn't a bomb.<br />- I thought there was a bomb!
1612446 1614346 No bomb.
1620346 1623646 - Yeah.<br />- I didn't say "Simon says."
1623946 1628546 It's 9:50,John.<br />The number 3 train is arriving now.
1628846 1632046 I left something provocative<br />on that train, John.
1632346 1634546 Simon says,<br />get to the pay phone...
1634746 1637946 next to the news kiosk<br />in Wall Street Station by 10:20...
1638246 1641346 - Half an hour.<br />- or the number 3 train<br />and its passengers vaporize.
1641646 1644946 Use any means of travel<br />other than civilian, I blow the train.
1645246 1647646 Attempt to evacuate the subway,<br />I blow the train.
1648046 1650746 I'll call you in 30 minutes.<br />Be there.
1652647 1654347 - We're fucked.<br />- Ninety blocks in 30 minutes?
1654547 1658047 In New York traffic?<br />It could be double that.
1658347 1660947 We don't even have a car!
1661147 1663147 Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!<br />I'm a cop! I'm a cop!
1663347 1665747 - I am requisitioning this car<br />for official police business.<br />- Hey, what are you doing?
1666047 1668447 - Thank you very much. Get in! Get in!<br />- What the fuck you doing to my car?<br />- Pretty slick.
1668747 1671947 Listen, I used to drive a cab.<br />The fastest way south is...
1672347 1674747 What the fuck are you doing?
1679647 1683747 - What were you sayin'?<br />- I was saying I used to drive a cab.
1683947 1687847 Ninth Avenue is the fastest way south.<br />But we seem to be going east.
1694147 1697047 Where the hell are you going, McClane?<br />I told you Ninth Avenue<br />was the quickest way south!
1697447 1700947 - Stop with that goddam yelling!<br />I know what I'm doing!<br />- Not even God knows what you're doing!
1701247 1703747 They're headed east on 72nd<br />towards the park.
1704047 1707147 - But Wall Street is south!<br />- Man, stop yelling at me!<br />I got a bad headache!
1707447 1710647 And the best way south is not<br />Ninth Avenue, it's through the park.
1712347 1714647 Oh, dear.
1714847 1716947 I told you the park drive<br />is always jammed.
1717147 1719747 I didn't say park drive.
1721647 1723547 I said through the park.
1726448 1729048 Shit! We lost 'em.<br />They're in the park headed south.
1730448 1733848 - Get outta here!<br />- Fucking prick!
1739748 1742848 I got him, Connie.<br />He's taking the scenic route.
1743248 1745548 - Outta the way!<br />- Oh, man.
1748248 1750248 Get out! Get outta there!
1754648 1756448 Watch it, watch it, watch it,<br />watch it! Oh, my God!
1756648 1758448 Are you... Are you aiming<br />for these people?
1758648 1761048 No. Well, maybe that mime.
1761248 1764348 Tree! Tree! Tree!
1767748 1771348 What's goin' on here?
1773748 1775848 Look out!
1777148 1780148 - Tree! Tree!<br />- Just hang on.
1780448 1783048 Rock! Rock! Rock!
1788248 1791348 Hey, look out down there!
1791548 1795248 McClane! McClane, watch it.
1798549 1801449 McClane!
1807049 1809349 Come on! Outta the way!
1809549 1812049 - How do Catholics do their thing?<br />- North, south, west, east.
1813049 1814949 - How much time?<br />- Twenty-seven minutes.
1815149 1818449 Ha! 72nd and Broadway<br />to Central Park South in three minutes!
1820049 1822049 That's gotta be a fuckin' record.
1822349 1824949 Come on, get out...
1825149 1827749 Yeah. Now what?
1834449 1836649 - We need a fire truck.<br />- What?
1836949 1838749 To follow.
1842349 1844549 - 9-1-1.<br />- Lt John McClane, NYPD.
1844749 1847549 Access number 7479.<br />Calling from a civilian transmitter.
1847849 1850949 - Get me an emergency<br />dispatcher right away.<br />- Dispatch. Go ahead.
1851249 1853649 I got two officers down at the corner<br />of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue!
1853849 1855949 Need an ambulance! Over!
1856249 1859149 Emergency calls on the west side<br />go to Roosevelt Hospital.<br />That's two blocks from here.
1886850 1889750 - Slow the fuck down, McClane!<br />- Kinda like football, isn't it?
1890050 1893250 - What?<br />- Get yourself a blocker<br />and head for the end zone!
1896350 1898650 If you'd said Wall Street,<br />we could've followed him all the way.
1898850 1901050 Wrong! South of 14th Street's<br />a different hospital!
1901250 1904050 St Luke's. Hang on.
1913550 1916450 - Time?<br />- 10:02.
1916750 1919050 We're halfway there<br />with 18 minutes to go.
1919350 1921150 Fuck this! Hang on.
1934450 1937750 Hang on. Get outta there!<br />Slide over and take the wheel.
1937950 1940051 - Where you goin'?<br />- We should be ahead<br />of that train, right?
1940251 1943351 - You're not gonna get on that train...<br />- I'm gonna get on that train! You gotta<br />get to that pay phone by 10:20!
1943651 1945451 - What are you gonna do?<br />- I'm gonna get that bomb.
1945651 1948251 Listen, you fail, I cover your ass.<br />I fail, you cover my ass.
1948651 1951951 - And if we both fail?<br />- Then we're both fucked.
1952151 1955651 Go now! Drive! Get to that<br />phone booth by 10:20! Go!

2160754 2163354 Hey, listen, bro,<br />I was here first.

2167554 2170054 Put your hands up!
2186154 2189954 - I have to answer that phone.<br />- Just shut up and get 'em in the air!
2190254 2193654 Watch it! Excuse me! Pardon me!<br />Watch, watch your back! Watch it!
2193954 2196154 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />I'm a New York police officer.
2196354 2200254 I'm gonna ask you to calmly<br />and quietly start moving towards<br />the other end of the car.
2200554 2203454 Go now, please! Go now!

2218454 2221554 Look, if you have to shoot me...
2221954 2224855 then you go ahead<br />and you shoot me!
2225055 2229455 But I have to answer this phone,<br />all right?
2234955 2238555 - I'm here.<br />- And McClane?
2238955 2242055 He's on his way. Uh, you know, he's<br />a little slow. He's kinda out of shape.
2242255 2246755 The rules applied to both of you.<br />I'm afraid this is noncompliance.
2247055 2248955 Goodbye.
2255755 2260055 Trust me, guys. Duck.
2297056 2299756 Hey, get outta there!<br />Get outta there! Duck, asshole!
2323956 2325756 Oh, my God!
2351556 2352856 McClane?
2359856 2361156 What?
2365656 2369057 - You can see right down into the subway.<br />- How many fire trucks do you count?
2369357 2372157 - You guys! You guys!<br />- How can you see it from up here?
2372957 2374757 Damn! Get in there.
2375057 2378757 Officer, tell those people<br />to get the hell back, will ya?
2379057 2381457 We got a shitload of cuts and bruises,<br />a couple concussions...
2381757 2384257 some old guy's pacemaker stopped,<br />and a pregnant girl's water broke.
2384557 2386557 And that's all.<br />How're you doin', John?
2386857 2388957 Still can't hear too good.
2389157 2392157 Well, it's a miracle you're still alive.<br />It's a goddam miracle.
2392357 2394657 - Yeah, that's the problem, Joe.<br />- What?
2394857 2398557 The miracle part. What are the odds<br />of us makin' it down here on time?
2399957 2402057 - Zip.<br />- That bomb was gonna go off<br />no matter what.
2402357 2404457 He wanted it to go off<br />right down here.
2404657 2407057 Take this off me, Dave.
2407457 2409557 Well, what's so special<br />about this place?
2409757 2412257 - I don't know.<br />Something just doesn't add up.<br />- Lt McClane?
2412657 2415157 They're asking for you and a Mr Carver.
2418457 2419757 - Where?<br />- John?
2421757 2425657 John, this is Andy Cross<br />with the FBI.
2426057 2429957 - This is Mr Jarvis. He's...<br />- I'm, uh, with another agency.
2430357 2432957 - It's good to meet you.<br />- This is Lt McClane.
2433257 2435957 This is Mr Carver.
2436257 2438757 We've got<br />a couple of questions first.
2439057 2441158 Do you recognize this guy?
2445758 2448758 - No.<br />- How about this one?
2453258 2455458 How about you?
2457458 2459758 Did you recognize<br />the voice on the phone?
2459958 2461758 No.
2461958 2464558 Did you, uh, notice<br />any cars following you?
2468058 2470558 - No.<br />- Anybody following you at all?
2470758 2473258 Any kind of surveillance?<br />Telephone? House?
2473558 2476458 Anything unusual at all?
2476758 2481158 Well, now that you mention it,<br />I have experienced a...
2481458 2483858 you know, like a burning sensation<br />between my toes.
2484058 2487158 I thought it was just some athlete's<br />foot or something. I don't know.
2490158 2494058 We read your jacket, Lieutenant.<br />We were told you would be cooperative.
2494358 2496158 - Cooperate with what?<br />What do you mean cooperate?<br />- Hey, now wait a minute. He will be.
2496458 2498958 - We're wasting time<br />here in this goddam van.<br />- You wanna share information...
2499158 2500958 how about sending<br />a little our way as well?
2501158 2503358 - Look, we wanna hear<br />what he knows first.<br />- What the hell?
2503558 2506158 - You give us pictures, and then you...<br />- Look, we want to hear<br />what he knows first.
2506358 2508558 Hey, I know as much as you know.<br />All right?
2510058 2512559 There's a guy out there<br />settin' off bombs.
2512759 2516259 He calls himself Simon.<br />He speaks with a German accent.
2516459 2519259 And, for some reason,<br />he's very angry with me.
2519559 2522159 Now, maybe you can tell me<br />why, fellas.
2527659 2531459 The first man there is Methias Targo.<br />Was Hungarian army.
2531659 2534259 Explosives expert. Now we believe<br />he's working for the Iranians.
2534659 2538459 - Working?<br />- Freelance terrorism, by contract.
2540159 2541959 - Who's the girl?<br />- Targo's other half.
2542159 2544559 Rumour is the Israelis slipped a bomb<br />in between their sheets.
2544759 2548359 Uh, he wasn't at home,<br />but they think maybe they got her.
2548559 2552659 The second man was an obscure colonel<br />in the East German army.
2553059 2557259 He ran an infiltration unit.<br />The kind of thing the Nazis did<br />at the Battle of the Bulge.
2557559 2560459 - English-speaking troops...<br />- Yeah, yeah, I saw the movie.
2561759 2566659 All we know of him is the G.D.R. medical<br />records show he suffers from migraines.
2567059 2569759 His name is Peter Krieg.
2572359 2575659 Well, that is<br />an exceptional report, fellas.
2575959 2578459 Now do you wanna tell me<br />what the hell this has to do with me?
2578659 2581259 The name Gruber mean anything<br />to you, Lieutenant?
2585760 2589360 - It rings a bell, yeah.<br />- LA.
2589660 2592460 - What?<br />- That thing in the building in LA.
2594460 2596960 Peter Krieg was born...
2597160 2600260 Simon Peter Gruber.
2601560 2604660 He's Hans Gruber's brother.
2608860 2612760 - Oh, shit.<br />- Yeah, it's that thing in LA.
2613060 2615960 We figure he's got you<br />fitted up for a toe tag...
2616260 2619060 and he's gonna do anything<br />to get it tied.
2619260 2621960 Inspector!<br />Inspector, it's him!
2623760 2625960 Don't let him know we're here.
2629360 2632160 - Simon.<br />- Inspector.
2632460 2635160 Now, who from the FBI<br />is in the van, I wonder?
2635460 2637460 Let's see.<br />Almost certainly Cross.
2637660 2640260 - Come on, Andrew. Say hello.<br />- Hello.
2640560 2643660 And I know you never run alone,<br />so say hello, Bill.
2643960 2647060 Still trying to butch up<br />by chewing on your glasses, huh?
2649060 2653761 This, gentlemen, as they say,<br />is where the plot thickens.
2654161 2656261 I have put 2,400 pounds of explosive...
2656361 2659461 in one of the 1,446 schools<br />in greater New York.
2659861 2664061 It is fitted with a timer<br />set to explode at exactly 3:00 pm.
2665661 2668061 Thank you.<br />Your silence says I'm understood.
2668261 2670861 Did you say 2,400 pounds?
2671061 2672861 Yes, but please<br />don't interrupt again.
2673161 2675761 Simon says, if you attempt<br />to evacuate schools...
2675961 2677861 the bomb will be detonated<br />by radio.
2678161 2680161 And, gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.
2680461 2684261 Repeat, one school will be dismissed<br />at 3:00 pm, permanently.
2684661 2686261 - Unless...<br />- Unless what?
2686461 2690161 Unless John McClane and his new best<br />friend complete the tasks I set them.
2690461 2692461 John, are you listening?
2694161 2695661 Yeah.
2695861 2698561 The pay phone beyond Hope,<br />Tomkins Square Park.
2698861 2701461 Twenty minutes.<br />Go by foot. No rush.
2701761 2705661 If you're really clever,<br />you'll learn the location of the bomb<br />and the code to disarm it.
2706061 2707861 Oh, and by the way, gentlemen...
2708161 2710961 we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.
2711261 2713461 The only problem is<br />the darn things seem to respond...
2713761 2715661 to police and FBI frequencies.
2715961 2719061 So, if I were you,<br />I'd keep off your radios.
2719361 2721061 Simon, wait.
2725462 2728262 Twenty-four hundred pounds<br />of that liquid stuff.
2728562 2731662 My God.<br />Get me the commissioner.
2731862 2734562 He's doing a press conference. He's<br />supposed to be here in half an hour.
2734962 2737962 All right, Ricky, get<br />every senior officer on the site<br />and get 'em here right away.
2738262 2740362 You're not gonna give me<br />any jurisdictional nonsense on this?
2740662 2742962 I got two kids<br />in the school on 64th Street.
2744662 2746562 - What can I do to help you?<br />- How many men have you got?
2746662 2749962 Seventy-five. But if I push the panic<br />button, I can get 500 from Washington.
2750262 2752362 - When?<br />- 2:30, 3:00.
2752562 2754762 Between now and then...
2755062 2758862 We're gonna have to do this<br />all by ourselves. Let's go.
2759162 2762362 And Tomkins Square Park<br />is more than two miles away,<br />so you guys better get running.
2762562 2764562 No radios.<br />You take my telephone.
2764862 2768162 You get anything, you call me<br />through the switchboard. Good luck.
2768362 2771462 Thanks.<br />Find that bomb.
2771762 2773562 - Ricky, where are they?<br />- Right over here.
2773862 2776462 - The senior man present is Chief Allen.<br />- Chief of what?
2776662 2778862 - Transit.<br />- Okay, thanks, Ricky.
2779062 2781862 Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.<br />Chief Allen.
2782062 2784562 The man who has done this<br />has told us that he has planted...
2784762 2789362 another very large bomb in a school<br />here in the New York area.
2789662 2793962 And he has told us that we cannot<br />evacuate, but he has not said<br />that we cannot search.
2794262 2797063 Now, I recommend we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody...
2797263 2799463 I'm talking about police,<br />transit, sanitation, fire...
2799663 2801463 even the goddam librarians...
2801763 2805263 and we start searching schools,<br />and I mean right now.
2805563 2808163 I'm talking about a thousand buildings<br />within the city limits...
2808363 2810763 and we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it in.
2810963 2813663 Now, I'd like to keep the media<br />out of this as long as possible...
2813863 2816663 because if they get in,<br />we've got a panic.
2816963 2818663 Are we in agreement?
2818963 2821863 Come on, guys. Let's go!
2822163 2827263 Move it out! Move it out!<br />No radio contact. No radio contact.
2837063 2841763 They bought it.<br />You can begin.
2856963 2859263 Hook, line...
2862363 2864363 and sinker.
2869564 2871964 All right now, men.<br />Let's go! Let's go!
2875064 2876464 Let's go!
2888064 2890764 - Hey, hold on. Let me go over there.<br />- I gotta get through!
2905864 2909064 Sergeant Turley!<br />Sergeant Turley!
2909264 2912264 In the last five minutes, the volume<br />of calls in here has tripled!
2912464 2916064 - What the hell is goin' on?<br />- Stop. Let me explain.
2916464 2919564 For the rest of the day,<br />we're supposed to handle<br />the department's communications.
2919764 2921664 What do you mean "handle"?
2921964 2925764 They're shutting down the police band.<br />All calls will be coming<br />through this switchboard.
2926064 2928164 And I'm gonna marry Donald Trump!
2928464 2932664 Walsh, what's going on?<br />Why'd everybody tear out of here?
2932964 2936664 Come on, Pamela. Look at your watch!<br />It's comin' up on shift change.
2936864 2938664 The bean counters are worried<br />about overtime...
2938964 2941165 so we sent everybody back<br />to the precinct to punch out.
2941365 2944965 - The next shift<br />is gonna be here in a minute.<br />- You are so full of shit, Walsh!
2945265 2947065 Thank you.
2954665 2956365 What the hell?
2968565 2972965 Detective, Bob Thompson,<br />city engineer's office.
2974565 2977065 We'd like to get an idea<br />of the damage.
2979065 2982065 Man, you guys really<br />got here fast.
2983265 2986865 Well, it's Wall Street, sir.
2987265 2989265 A lot of money here.
2989465 2994065 A lot of opinion makers the mayor<br />doesn't wanna piss off, you know?
2995865 2997665 Is this it?
3000265 3003165 Holy Toledo!
3003465 3006265 Somebody had fun.
3006565 3010465 I'd appreciate it if you'd show<br />my associates the way down.
3012566 3015066 Yeah. Yeah, sure. Jimmy!
3015266 3019066 You got the flashlight?<br />Murphy, come on, you too!
3019466 3021566 - Rick Walsh.<br />- John Gunther.
3021866 3023966 Come on, gentlemen. Let's go!
3027566 3030366 You were probably at the World Trades.<br />You know what that mess was.
3063466 3066966 Please inform Mr Little<br />that Mr Vanderfloog is here.
3067266 3069066 Mr Vanderfloog?
3071866 3073966 There's a Mr Vanderfloog<br />for Mr Little.
3088367 3091567 Go down 20 metres! Come on!
3091967 3094767 - A lot of steam down here.<br />- Yeah, yeah. We snapped<br />a couple of the steam pipes.
3094967 3098767 It's like a sauna. We got the subway<br />guys to shut down the third rail.
3099067 3102367 - It's on emergency lighting.<br />- Yeah, emergency lights, and<br />there's still some light... Hey!
3103567 3106267 No shooting!<br />Speak English!
3106467 3108767 Otto doesn't speak English,<br />do you, Otto?
3109067 3111867 - Where the hell did we get this guy?<br />- He's one of Targo's thugs.
3114867 3117467 Pull all the way up!<br />Pull all the way! Pull all the way!
3124567 3127067 So what's up with this LA thing?<br />You famous or somethin'?
3127267 3129367 Yeah, for about five minutes.
3129667 3132067 - Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?<br />- Fuck you.
3132367 3134567 - You know this guy Simon<br />we're talking to?<br />- Yeah.
3134767 3138467 I threw his little brother off the 32nd<br />floor of Nakatomi Towers out in LA.
3139567 3141267 I guess he's a little<br />pissed off about it.
3141567 3143367 Wait a minute.<br />You mean to tell me I'm in this shit...
3143667 3146567 'cause some white cop threw some<br />white asshole's brother off a roof?
3192568 3194768 Mr Vanderfloog?<br />Felix Little, corporate relations.
3195068 3198168 Sorry you had to wait, but apparently<br />there was an explosion in the subway.
3198368 3200268 It's played hell<br />with our alarms, I'm afraid.
3200468 3204168 - I trust there's nothing wrong.<br />- Oh, no. Good Lord, no. Safe and secure.
3204568 3207468 Now, you were concerned<br />about a currency exchange?
3207668 3210668 W-We are not a commercial bank,<br />in the normal sense.
3210968 3213468 We're... We're primarily...
3213768 3216768 governments, central banks,<br />that sort of thing.
3216968 3219068 - Apart from the depository, of course.<br />- Of course.
3219268 3222668 Yeah. And you are in the flower<br />business, Mr Vanderfloog?
3226769 3228669 Back! Back! Come on!
3253969 3255469 Come on!
3268769 3271769 Oh, no, Mr Vanderfloog,<br />that's the vault elevator.
3273269 3276369 I'm sorry. Our alarms<br />are sonic and seismic...
3276669 3279069 two things which, I'm afraid,<br />do not react well to explosions.
3279469 3283269 You know, th-this subway business<br />has knocked all our systems<br />into a cocked hat.
3283469 3286169 In fact, we've had to give up<br />and pull the plug on the whole thing.
3286469 3289069 - The repair people are downstairs now.<br />- Good Lord!
3289469 3292769 Yes, yes. Heavens to Betsy!<br />If anyone knew!
3297169 3300370 But I thought this was<br />a currency exchange.
3300570 3303870 Oh, I think we'll go straight<br />to the withdrawal.
3352370 3354770 Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here<br />and take a look at this?
3355070 3357270 Somethin's going on.
3357570 3359370 What do you think, guys?<br />You'll be able to fix that?
3359570 3361270 Just a minute now.
3365170 3367370 Okay, I'll be right back. Down!
3372471 3374471 Stay back!
3374771 3377371 Stay back!
3409871 3412171 Come on. Come on. Shit.
3422571 3423971 - Come on.<br />- Front desk.
3424171 3426871 Yes. Call the police. Get your ass<br />down here right now! I'm under attack!
3427071 3429971 Hey, just relax, mate.<br />Maybe you'll live through this.
3430271 3431971 Shit!
3454072 3457072 I think he's dead, my dear.
3458972 3461172 All right.<br />Let's see to the office work.
3481472 3483772 God! It's Fort Knox!
3506472 3509672 $140 billion.
3509872 3511872 Ten times what's in Kentucky.
3513073 3515973 Fort Knox. Ha!<br />It's for tourists.
3530273 3532273 Yeah. McClane.
3532473 3535873 John, you're out of shape?<br />You barely made it.
3536273 3539673 Yeah, well, we all barely make it.<br />What do you want us to do?
3539873 3542573 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3542873 3546173 - What?<br />- What did he say?
3546573 3548573 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3548773 3552273 What's the matter with you? Don't you<br />have kids? That's an elephant joke.
3560573 3562573 That a bomb?
3562873 3565573 - Yeah. Go, go ahead and grab it.<br />- No. You're the cop.
3565873 3568373 - Man, Simon said you're supposed to be<br />helpin' with this.<br />- I'm helpin'.
3568673 3571573 - Well, when're you gonna start helpin'?<br />- After you get the bomb.
3589274 3591674 - Careful.<br />- I'm being careful.
3591974 3593774 - Don't open it.<br />- What?
3593974 3596674 I gotta open it.<br />Uh, it's gonna be all right.
3609274 3612974 Shit! Shit!<br />I told you not to open it!
3617674 3619774 I trust you see the message.
3620074 3623174 It has a proximity circuit,<br />so, please, don't run.
3623374 3626474 Yeah, I got it. We're not gonna run.<br />How do we turn this thing off?
3626774 3629874 On the fountain there should be<br />two jugs. Do you see them?
3630174 3632474 A five-gallon and a three-gallon.
3632774 3636474 Fill one of the jugs<br />with exactly four gallons of water...
3636774 3640074 and place it on the scale<br />and the timer will stop.
3640274 3644674 You must be precise. One ounce more<br />or less will result in detonation.
3644974 3646874 If you're still alive in five minutes,<br />we'll speak then.
3647074 3648874 Wait! Wait a sec...
3652774 3654674 - I don't get it. Do you get it?<br />- No.
3656975 3658775 Get the jugs.
3660575 3663675 Obviously, we can't fill<br />the three-gallon jug with<br />four gallons of water, right?
3663875 3666375 - Obviously.<br />- All right. I know. Here we go.
3666675 3669375 We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?
3669675 3672675 Okay. Now, we pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug...
3673075 3675575 giving us exactly three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug, right?
3675875 3679675 - Right. Then what?<br />- Okay. Now, take the three-gallon jug,<br />fill that a third of the way up...
3680075 3682375 - No, no, no. He said be precise.<br />Exactly four gallons.<br />- Shit!
3682575 3686175 Every cop in 50 miles is runnin'<br />his ass off, and I'm out here<br />playin' kids games in a park.
3688275 3690775 You wanna focus<br />on the problem at hand?
3707075 3709675 I thought you said you knew! You said<br />don't say anything if you don't know!
3709975 3711675 I thought you said... Gimme the fuckin'<br />jug. We're startin' over.
3711975 3713775 - No! We can't start over!<br />We can't start over!<br />- Pour that out! We're startin' over!
3713875 3716475 - We can't start over.<br />- Gimme the fuckin' jug, or I'm gonna put<br />my foot up your ass, you dumb mother...
3716775 3719375 - Say it! Say it!<br />- What?
3719575 3721375 - You were gonna call me<br />a nigger, weren't you?<br />- No, I wasn't!
3721575 3723975 - Yes, you were.<br />What were you gonna call me?<br />- Asshole!
3724275 3725775 How's that, asshole?
3725975 3727876 You got some fuckin' problem<br />with me 'cause I'm white, Zeus?
3728076 3731776 Is that it? Have I oppressed you?<br />Have I oppressed your people somehow?
3732076 3734776 I'll tell you what your problem is. You<br />don't like me 'cause you're a racist!
3735076 3737176 - What?<br />- You're a racist.<br />You don't like me 'cause I'm white.
3737476 3740176 I don't like you<br />because you're gonna get me killed!
3740376 3742176 How much time?<br />Aw, shit!
3742376 3744376 We got less than a minute.<br />Throw this thing away.
3744576 3746376 No, we can't take it off of there.<br />It'll detonate. Just, wait.
3746676 3748876 Wait a second. Wait a second.
3750376 3752476 I got it! I got it!<br />Exactly two gallons in here, right?
3752676 3755076 - Right.<br />- Leaving exactly one gallon<br />of empty space, right?
3755276 3757176 - Yeah.<br />- A full five gallons here, right?
3757376 3759676 - Right.<br />- If you pour one gallon out of the five<br />gallons into there we have exactly...
3759976 3762976 - Four gallons in there!<br />- Yes!<br />- Pour it in there! Come on!
3763376 3765276 Come on!
3765576 3767776 Don't spill. Don't spill it!
3767976 3770676 - Good, good, good! Exactly four gallons.<br />- You did it, McClane.
3770976 3773676 - Put it on the thing!<br />Get it down there!<br />- Oh, shit.
3781776 3784876 Congratulations.<br />You're still alive.
3785276 3787176 Congratulations.
3787376 3790776 - Yeah, we did it.<br />- You surprise me again, John.
3790976 3792876 This is becoming an ugly habit.
3793176 3796076 Yeah, well, I don't have the time<br />right now, Simon. Listen.
3796276 3798577 Deal's a deal.<br />Where's the school bomb?
3798777 3801677 On the contrary,<br />you have lots of time.
3801977 3803977 You have...
3804177 3806977 two hours and 47 minutes precisely.
3807377 3809677 Plenty of time<br />to test those wits of yours.
3809977 3812077 Hey! Hey! Hey, listen, jerk-off!
3812277 3814877 Let me tell you somethin'!<br />I got a bad fuckin' hangover, all right?
3815177 3817777 And I'm a little sick of these fuckin'<br />riddles! Now, where is the school bomb?
3817977 3822277 Temper, John.<br />The road to truth has many turns.
3822577 3825877 You will find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3826177 3830177 When you undertake the trip it suggests,<br />ask yourself this question:
3830577 3834077 What is 21 out of 42?
3836377 3838777 We're behind.<br />We should abandon the rest and go.
3838977 3841977 Relax, Targo.<br />There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3842177 3846477 He's sending us to the home team dugout<br />at Yankee Stadium. Why?
3846777 3849077 Well, we're the home team. Are we<br />supposed to find something there?
3849377 3851177 What's 21 out of 42?
3851377 3854577 Twenty-one again.<br />Half of 42. Forty-two what?
3854877 3857677 - How many players<br />are on the Yankees ball club?<br />- Twenty-five.
3857977 3861377 - What else is 21? Blackjack.<br />- It's a club.
3861677 3864077 It's a wild goose chase,<br />is what it is.
3868277 3870378 Where's the nearest "A" train?
3870578 3872378 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
3872478 3874578 You know,<br />some kid might find that.
3876378 3878178 You're right.
3883778 3886178 Come back here!<br />You little sons of bitches!
3886378 3888978 Hey, you! I remember you!
3890578 3892378 Hey, hey, hey. Where're you going?<br />Come here. What are you doin'?
3892678 3894778 - What are you doin'?<br />- Let me go! Let me go, dick-head.
3895078 3896478 Watch your mouth.
3896578 3899678 You wanna go down to juvenile hall<br />for a Butterfinger? Is that it?
3899978 3902678 Look around, man.<br />All the cops are into somethin'.
3902878 3904878 It's Christmas.<br />You could steal City Hall.
3912278 3913978 - Come on. Let's go. Come on.<br />- My bike.
3914178 3916378 - Yo, that's my bike!<br />- Yeah. It's Christmas.
3916578 3920678 - Hey, hey, hey! Where're you going?<br />Yankee Stadium's that way!<br />- That's my bike, you asshole!
3927478 3930378 Why don't you just run over everybody<br />in the whole street?
3930578 3932978 McClane, what the fuck<br />are we doin' back down here?
3933178 3935778 Let me ask you somethin'. What is it<br />that Wall Street doesn't have?
3936078 3937878 What, is this stuff catchin'?<br />You're talkin' in riddles.
3938078 3940478 - No, no. Stay with me. What is it<br />that Wall Street does not have?<br />- What?
3940778 3943779 Schools. And what is it<br />they have a shitload of?
3944179 3946079 What?
3953479 3956679 - I'll be back in a minute.<br />- What am I supposed to do with this?
3958579 3960279 Give it to those guys over there.
3960479 3961579 He's here.
3961879 3963779 Perhaps you could be<br />a little more specific.
3963979 3967979 McClane is here.<br />He's walking toward the bank.
3969279 3971679 And the black man<br />is coming toward me.
3971979 3974679 Oh, now that's a pity.
3974979 3977279 And after we've gone to all<br />that trouble at the stadium.
3977479 3979579 Simon, kill him.
3979779 3982279 Stop toying with him<br />and kill him now.
3983579 3985579 Okay. So be it.
3985879 3990679 May he rest in peace.<br />I'll inform Karl in the lobby.
3990979 3993779 - You pack up your team<br />and get out of there.<br />- And this one?
3995079 3996779 Officer.
3999179 4001679 Yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm afraid<br />I'm gonna need an answer on that issue.
4007179 4010679 - Let him go.<br />- Understood. Yes, sir?
4010879 4013480 John McClane says to give you this.
4015180 4017580 Wait, wait. Jesus, don't open it.<br />It's a bomb.
4017880 4019280 - Another?<br />- Yeah.
4019580 4022280 Oh, I see. Um, oh,<br />we'll take care of that.
4022480 4024780 We better move now. Sir,<br />thank you so much for your assistance.
4025080 4027280 We really appreciate it.<br />Thank you.
4030380 4033280 What are you doing?
4035380 4039680 - I don't want to ride with it.<br />- Some kid could...
4040080 4041980 Put it in the back.
4047480 4051080 Hey! Y-You, you,<br />leavin' this place unguarded?
4060280 4061980 I understand.
4072080 4074580 - How ya doin'?<br />- All right.
4074780 4077280 John McClane. NYPD.
4077580 4082080 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah. It's laundry day.
4083480 4085481 What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
4085681 4088081 Has it been quiet like this<br />all morning here?
4088281 4091481 - Well...<br />- Except for that big explosion<br />a couple of hours ago.
4091781 4094681 I mean, have you seen anything strange<br />happen in the last hour or so?
4094881 4098081 No. And we've had cops in here<br />pretty steady since the subway thing.
4098481 4100081 Yeah.
4100281 4102981 We were just gonna make a round on<br />the vault floor, if you wanna tag along.
4103281 4105681 Sure. Yeah. I think I will.
4105981 4108081 Now, what do you think of this heat<br />this late in the year?
4108381 4109981 Eh, Indian summer, huh?
4110181 4113381 Yeah, it feels like it's gonna rain<br />like dogs and cats later.
4113681 4117781 - Here's one of your guys.<br />- Detective, uh, Otto, isn't it?
4118081 4119881 John McClane.
4122681 4124381 Hey, Mike. How ya doin'?
4126681 4130281 I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna<br />take the stairs just for the exercise.
4130681 4132581 And on a hot day like this.
4132881 4135581 But it seems like I always end up<br />riding the lift.
4162782 4164782 Hey, what was the lottery number<br />last night?
4164982 4168082 Any of you guys<br />play the lottery? No?
4168382 4171282 Ah, my wife buys me two tickets<br />every week.
4171482 4173482 For the last ten years,<br />plays the same two numbers all the time.
4173682 4175482 I said, "Honey, why don't you play<br />a different number?"
4175782 4178182 She goes,<br />"Well, those are my lucky numbers."
4178382 4180482 I got the tickets right here.
4182482 4186082 Put that fuckin' gun down!<br />Put that fuckin' gun down now!
4193082 4194882 Put it down!
4200382 4202382 Hello!
4202582 4204682 Anybody down here?
4215082 4216982 - Put your hands up!<br />Put your fuckin' hands up now!<br />- No, no, no!
4217282 4219682 John, no!<br />No! God, it's me! It's me!
4222182 4224882 - Jesus Christ,<br />you almost gave me a heart attack.<br />- You all right?
4225082 4226482 You all right?
4226582 4228683 - Yeah, yeah. It's not my blood.<br />- What the hell's goin' on down here?
4228983 4230683 Go take a look in there.
4254083 4257583 Hey, McClane.<br />Where the hell is everybody?
4257783 4259683 Simon fuckin' says!
4261583 4264383 I should've seen it comin' a mile away.<br />This was never about revenge.
4264583 4267583 - It's about a goddam heist.<br />- Wh-Wh-What was in the room?
4267883 4271283 - This.<br />- What is this?
4271583 4273883 - Oh, shit! Is this gold?<br />- Yeah, it's gold.
4274083 4276983 Damn, this is heavy!<br />They cleaned out a whole room of this?
4277183 4281183 - Yeah.<br />- You know, that would've taken<br />like a, a, a, a tank, or a, or a, a...
4281483 4283683 A dump truck.
4283883 4285883 Fourteen great big dump trucks.
4286183 4288283 - We almost got hit by a dump truck.<br />- Shit!
4288483 4290983 - Damn. Slow down! Shit!<br />- Put that shit down.
4291183 4293183 - No fuckin' way.<br />- They ain't gonna let you keep it.
4293383 4295483 - Yeah, yeah, we'll see.<br />- We're gonna need a car.
4295783 4297283 A car?
4302684 4305984 - You know how to hot-wire this thing?<br />- Of course I can. I'm an electrician.
4306184 4307984 Only problem is...
4311784 4313784 takes too fuckin' long.
4326084 4329884 - Not on the bridge!<br />- Down there, McClane. The FDR.
4333284 4335084 Let's go, let's go. Come on!
4336584 4339084 - Oh, shit!<br />- What?
4339384 4341784 - They shot the phone.<br />- Oh, too bad.
4342084 4344584 - Come on. What's 21 out of 42?<br />- I don't have a clue.
4344884 4348584 - Well, what about Yankee stadium?<br />- We'll get there, but that son of<br />a bitch is not gettin' off of Manhattan.
4348784 4350584 - Move!<br />- Jesus Christ!
4350784 4352284 Who do you think you are, lady,<br />Hillary Clinton?
4352484 4354184 - That's it! Hillary Clinton.<br />- What?
4354384 4356984 - The 42nd president.<br />- No. She'd be the 43rd president.
4357184 4361184 - All right, all right.<br />But who's the 21 st?<br />- I don't know.
4361584 4363384 - You don't know?<br />- No, I don't know! Do you know?
4363484 4365384 - No!<br />- Well?
4365684 4367684 What kind of engine does this piece<br />of shit have? Come on, step on it!
4367884 4370985 It's a Yugo. It's built<br />for economy, not speed.
4373585 4375885 - What are you doin'?<br />- I'm gonna get us another phone.
4379285 4381685 Wait, wait, wait!
4381885 4385085 - Hey, who was the 21 st president?<br />- Go fuck yourself!
4387385 4390885 - That guy was pissed.<br />- He'll feel better<br />when he looks in the back seat.
4391285 4393185 Oh, shit.<br />That was my gold bar!
4393385 4395885 This is McClane.<br />Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.
4396085 4399285 - John, where the hell are you?<br />- Walter, it's not a revenge.<br />It's a heist.
4399585 4402885 - What?<br />- There's gold in the Federal Reserve,<br />and they took a shitload of it.
4403285 4406685 - They're headed north in dump trucks.<br />- Have you been drinking, McClane?
4406885 4408685 No, not since this morning.
4408885 4411685 Listen. There's a line of dump trucks<br />northbound on the FDR at about 70th.
4411885 4414385 You gotta close the bridge and get some<br />helicopters over there right away.
4414585 4416685 I couldn't close a hot dog stand<br />right now.
4416985 4419785 I'm spread all over hell.<br />What about this damn bomb?
4420085 4422585 Find out who the 21 st president was.<br />It's got somethin' to do with this.
4422785 4424485 John! John, the 21 st what?
4424585 4428385 Walter! Shit!<br />Goddam cellular fuckin' phones!
4428785 4430485 - Get hold of Munson in Triborough.<br />- Inspector.
4430785 4433585 Tell him to close all the East River<br />bridges north of 59th Street.
4433885 4435685 - Lookin' for dump trucks.<br />- Dump trucks?
4435985 4439685 McClane says there are dump trucks<br />headed up the FDR loaded with gold.
4439985 4443086 Walter, they don't allow<br />dump trucks on the FDR!
4443386 4445386 - Connie!<br />- All right.<br />You don't want I should argue.
4445686 4447986 I won't argue,<br />no matter how stupid it is.
4448186 4450986 K-9, bring it around to the back.<br />Check out the boiler room.
4451286 4452986 Find anything, Charlie?
4453186 4456286 I could spend a week in here with<br />an X-ray machine and still not find it.
4456586 4459786 You don't have a week, Charlie.<br />You got five more minutes. Then<br />we're movin' up to 86th Street.
4459986 4462186 We're goin' as fast as we can.
4462486 4463886 What's up?
4464186 4467486 McClane was mentioning something<br />about the Federal Reserve Building.
4467786 4471186 - Isn't that right near that Wall Street<br />bomb site we just left?<br />- Yeah.
4477586 4479686 How long do you want us<br />to stay here?
4479986 4482386 The men at the stadium.<br />Stay or go?
4482586 4484786 Karl should have checked in by now.
4484986 4486986 Moment.
4494186 4496186 Come on. Come on.
4497586 4500686 Stay where you are.<br />McClane may still turn up.
4501986 4505486 Relax, Targo.<br />If he is still alive...
4505886 4508186 he won't be talking to anyone.
4508386 4509686 It's the next turn-off.
4511186 4513286 Hi. It's Elvis Duran.<br />You're on the air. What's up?
4513486 4516387 First of all, I just wanna tell you<br />what a great show you got.
4516687 4519387 - I listen to you all the time.<br />- Thank you. Thank you.<br />What do you wanna talk about?
4519687 4522587 Well, you know all those cop cars<br />screamin'around everywhere?
4522987 4526187 You know what they're up to?<br />There's a bomb in a school.
4526387 4528587 - My cousin's a cop.<br />- Here you go, my dear.
4528787 4531087 Somebody put a big bomb<br />in a school somewhere.
4531387 4533587 - Seven. Five.<br />- Only they don't know which one.
4533887 4535787 - 207...<br />- So they're searching all of them.
4535987 4538887 - Shh. Shh.<br />- Every school in the metropolitan area.

4552387 4554087 - They're gone.<br />- What?

4556487 4558587 Shit! Down there! Down there!
4560587 4564087 - This thing got air bags?<br />- Your side does. I don't know about my...
4565387 4567187 McClane!
4587288 4589088 In the truck,<br />let me see the hands.
4590588 4592288 Put 'em on the door!
4596388 4598688 Don't kill me! Don't shoot me!
4600388 4602188 - You a truck driver?<br />- No, I'm a beautician.
4602388 4604688 Of course I'm a truck driver!
4605988 4609088 - Where are you takin' this truck?<br />- The aqueduct.
4609388 4611088 What are you takin' a dump truck<br />to the race track for?
4611288 4615888 - No, the aqueduct. The aque...<br />The water aqueduct!<br />- Aqueduct?
4618588 4622788 See? Goes from here all the way up<br />to the Catskill Mountains.
4623188 4624988 - What does?<br />- That! The water pipe!
4625288 4627388 Goes for about 60 miles.
4634588 4635888 - Hey, you the foreman?<br />- Yeah.
4636088 4640488 NYPD. You had any, like,<br />extra dump trucks come through here<br />in the last couple of minutes?
4640788 4642588 I'm gonna write<br />those fuckin' clowns up.
4642888 4644988 They better start<br />payin' attention to work orders,<br />or we're gonna kick some butt.
4645288 4648388 - Who? Who are you talkin' about?<br />- Ah, the dozen idiots<br />who tore ass up the tube!
4648588 4651488 We're not loadin' up there any more.<br />We're loadin' over here.
4651688 4653688 So much for bridges and helicopters.
4653988 4655788 You got a map that shows me<br />where this tunnel goes?
4656088 4657789 Yeah. Right here.
4659789 4663289 We run pretty much up<br />under the Saw Mill<br />till you get up to the Coffer Dam.
4663589 4666289 From there on, we've already brought<br />the water down from the reservoir.
4666589 4670689 - Anybody get in or outta there?<br />- Yeah. There's a vent shaft<br />every two miles.
4670989 4672389 - No. I mean with a truck.<br />- At the Coffer Dam.
4672589 4674889 You can get a truck in there.<br />You can get there on the surface.
4675089 4678189 Just follow the Saw Mill River Parkway<br />up there. It's about 20 miles.
4678489 4680289 All right. I'm gonna meet you<br />right there, all right?
4680489 4681989 Wait, wait!<br />Wh-What am I supposed to do?
4682189 4685089 - You're gonna go up to Yankee Stadium.<br />- McClane!
4685389 4687189 Go! Get outta here.<br />We got less than two hours.
4687389 4689189 Goddam it!
4694389 4696589 Hey! Is somethin' wrong?
4696889 4699189 480 yards of rock moved so far.
4699489 4701389 Now, that's ten times<br />the Hoover Dam.
4701689 4705489 Right now, there's 516 feet of rock<br />above our heads.
4705789 4708389 This part is phase three<br />of tunnel three.
4708689 4711589 Planning for it began<br />back in 1954...
4711789 4714489 but construction didn't begin<br />till June of 1970.
4714689 4717089 You know what the most interesting part<br />of tunnel three is?
4717289 4719689 - What's that, Jerry?<br />- The valves. Each one...
4726589 4730890 A big departure<br />from tunnels one and two.
4731190 4734490 Come on! What a hell of a place<br />to break down.
4734690 4737390 Hold it a minute, Jerry.<br />Let me have your hard hat.
4737790 4740390 - You got a jacket?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.
4740590 4742690 Wait here a minute.
4742890 4745390 Wait until he gets<br />alongside the door.
4745590 4748890 Hey, fellas.<br />Mickey O'Brian, aqueduct security.
4749190 4752090 Hey, listen. We got a report of a guy<br />comin' through here with eight reindeer.
4759790 4764490 Yeah, they said he was a jolly, old,<br />fat guy with a snowy-white beard.
4764790 4767390 Cute little red and white suit.<br />I'm surprised you didn't see him.
4770990 4773290 What is it with you guys<br />and these phones?
4774890 4777190 This'll give me somethin'.
4777490 4780490 Holy shit! Is that guy dead?
4780790 4784590 - Yes, Jerry. I'm afraid he is.<br />- Jesus Christ.
4784990 4787990 Yeah. I want you to get ahold<br />of a guy named Cobb.
4788190 4791690 Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.<br />He's the head of my police unit.
4792090 4795390 Get him down here. Find him.<br />Tell him you were with John McClane.
4795690 4799490 - Tell him to find out<br />who the 21 st president was.<br />- Chester A. Arthur.
4800891 4803991 - What?<br />- Chester A. Arthur. 1881 to 1885.
4804291 4806491 Nominated vice president in 1880.
4806691 4809591 Did you know he was the collector<br />of customs right here in New York?
4809791 4811791 No, I didn't know that, Jerry.
4812091 4813791 Take care of yourself.
4843591 4845691 Now?
4845991 4849391 No, there's only one of them.
4863391 4865591 Yes or no?
4867991 4868891 Yes or no?
4871792 4875092 No.<br />We need the other one too.
4877992 4880692 TV's got us. TV's got us.<br />We gotta release these traffic guys.
4880992 4882592 No. Traffic jams<br />we can take care of later.
4882792 4885092 - You find out what the hell<br />is wrong with this thing!<br />- Frequencies are jammed.
4885292 4887192 - What about Ricky?<br />- I don't know.<br />I can't get ahold of him.
4887392 4889392 - But, Walter, Federal Reserve.<br />- Yeah?

4897592 4898892 - Walter!<br />- Yeah?
4899192 4900892 You gotta hear this.
4904992 4907092 Christ, I thought we were<br />going in the back way.
4907292 4909992 This is the back way, Walter.
4910192 4913092 In half an hour, you're gonna have<br />a riot at every school in this city.
4919692 4922292 We'll start at the top floor.<br />Put 20 men on each floor.
4922592 4924792 Send the other 50 men<br />down to the basement with us.
4925092 4926992 - What about McClane?<br />- Not a word. I'm gettin' nothin'.
4927192 4929092 - Busy signals.<br />- Westchester's probably worse<br />than we are.
4929392 4931592 This is kinda puttin' all our eggs<br />in one basket, isn't it?
4931792 4933892 - I mean, what if McClane's wrong?<br />- Walter?<br />- Yeah?
4934092 4936592 This is Principal Martinez.<br />Principal Martinez, Inspector Cobb.
4936792 4939192 - How do you do, Inspector?<br />- How do you do, Principal Martinez?
4939492 4943693 I don't want to alarm your children.<br />I wonder if you could move them all<br />into the auditorium and keep them calm.
4962593 4965593 We are coming to the dam.<br />You can call the rear guard.
4970993 4973193 Rear guard, you can close up now.
4975093 4977593 We've reached the dam.<br />You can come up now.
4979193 4982793 Nils, you can close in now.
4983093 4986393 - Nils!<br />- Attention, attention. Nils is dead.
4986693 4989993 I repeat, Nils is dead, fuck-head.<br />So is his pal.
4990193 4992493 And those four guys<br />from the East German all-stars...
4992693 4994393 your boys down at the bank...
4994593 4996493 they're gonna be a little late.
4996693 4999293 John.
4999493 5004793 In the back of the truck you're driving,<br />there's $13 billion worth<br />in gold bullion.
5005193 5008293 - I wonder, would a deal<br />be out of the question?<br />- Yeah, I got a deal for ya.
5008593 5012193 Crawl out from under that rock<br />you're hidin' under, and I'll drive<br />this truck up your ass.
5013593 5014894 How colourful.
5020994 5023094 I told you not to toy with him.
5023394 5025194 Thank you. That's very helpful.
5028594 5031294 You've jeopardized the mission<br />and the contract.
5033994 5035794 We are vulnerable<br />till we reach the ship.
5035994 5037794 I'm going to put an end to this.
5040294 5042394 Stop!
5044594 5046394 Targo! Targo!

5074194 5076894 - Yeah?<br />- Okay. Now take a look at the front.

5245797 5248197 - Yeah! There's nobody there!<br />- You didn't see nobody?
5248397 5250597 - No!<br />- Nobody was followin' you?
5250897 5252897 I'm tellin' you.<br />He's jerkin' us around.

5264397 5266597 It's not rigged. Pull it.
5278197 5281897 Well, I'd say you could<br />call off your search.
5282197 5284397 - Can you stop it?<br />- I shouldn't even touch it.
5284597 5288797 Who knows what kind of booby traps<br />this thing's got. What about the code?
5289097 5290597 No word.
5290797 5293897 - When do we evacuate?<br />- Simon says he sees one kid<br />leave the building, boom!
5294297 5297397 Fine. There's a chance<br />that somebody's still watchin',<br />but we can't stand here...

5394099 5397199 Fire drill, my ass.<br />That guy ain't from the fire department.
5397599 5399399 Maybe it's 'cause of the radio.
5399699 5402499 You mean, like, they're after us? Nah.
5402799 5405899 - Tony squealed on us.<br />- No, he didn't.
5406099 5409399 - Come on.<br />- Well, where you goin'?
5412299 5414599 - Let me drive! Let me drive!<br />- Go, go, go!
5414799 5416299 Goddam it!
5418499 5421099 Why the hell didn't you tell me before?<br />Of course he put the bomb up<br />in that school.
5421499 5423999 - Why would he do that?<br />- Make sure he got<br />your complete attention.

5528101 5529801 Well, I ain't gonna know<br />till I ask him, am I?
5530001 5533201 Go around and see if there's<br />any aspirins in that glove box.
5534501 5536601 No way. You do it.
5542001 5544101 Ten quarters.
5544401 5547101 The guy in the dump truck<br />had ten quarters. Exactly ten quarters.
5547401 5550101 Well, maybe they were makin'<br />long distance phone calls.
5550301 5553501 No. For the bridge.
5553801 5555401 - What?<br />- It's for the toll on the bridge.
5557501 5559501 There! There! Down on the wharf.

5568901 5571001 Shit! How about the Coast Guard?
5571201 5573201 - It'd take 'em an hour to get here.<br />- Shit!
5573401 5576201 Shit! We can jump.
5576401 5577701 - What?<br />- We can jump.
5577901 5580101 Outta your fuckin' mind!<br />It's 100 feet down to the deck!
5580301 5583501 - But not to the crane, it isn't.<br />- The cables would cut you in half.
5584901 5586601 - I can make it.<br />- Bullshit. Get down.
5586802 5588802 Get down. Look in the back<br />of that car for some gloves.
5592802 5595802 Six booby traps, four dead ends...
5596102 5598702 And a partridge in a pear tree
5603102 5605702 Okay, honey.

5607502 5611002 We're gonna have sort of a race.<br />So when I say go, I want you all<br />to run like crazy.
5611202 5613502 All of you. You follow<br />the police officer and the fireman.
5613702 5615502 You guys are my front runners, okay?
5615802 5617902 Walter, think we're cuttin' this<br />a little thin?
5618102 5621502 No, Joe. We're gonna wait.<br />McClane still may get the code.
5624102 5626902 - Line me up with that crane!<br />- There. There. Right there. Right there.
5627102 5630402 - All right.<br />I see it now. I see it.<br />- Right there. You're okay.
5630602 5632902 - Shit. This is gonna take a miracle.<br />- Keep your fingers crossed.

5635402 5639402 Come on. Come on. You almost got it.<br />Almost. Almost. Yeah! All right.

5644702 5647402 We have the intercom rigged, sir.
5647602 5651602 Walter, the kids may be fine,<br />but you wait much longer and<br />I'm gonna pee in my pants.
5652002 5653802 We're gonna wait, Connie.
5655002 5656702 Six more minutes.
5671103 5672803 - Yo, McClane.<br />- What?
5673003 5674303 Down there.
5683903 5686803 Oh, shit. Go, go, man!<br />Go, go, go!
5712903 5715603 Oh, boy.

5758404 5760504 There's something you should see.
5760804 5762704 Later.
5763904 5767004 - It's important.<br />- Later.
5767204 5768104 Now.
5771104 5773604 This was in a container.
5788504 5792904 We go find Simon<br />and drag him to the ship-to-shore radio<br />and beat that fuckin' code out of him.
5793304 5795604 - Here. Take this.<br />- How's it work?
5795804 5799704 - You don't know how to shoot a gun?<br />- Look, all brothers don't know how<br />to shoot guns, you racist motherfucker.
5800104 5804105 Sue me. Just yank back on that<br />and pull the trigger. That's it.
5804305 5807605 - That's it?<br />- That's it. Just don't shoot yourself.
5808005 5810905 Hey, don't be no hero.<br />You find him, you come get me.
5828905 5830705 Hey, Katya!
5838105 5840405 Stupid. Stupid.
5882806 5885606 - You have the autopilot set?<br />- Yes, sir.
5885906 5887606 Good.
5892106 5894406 Don't fuckin' move.
5899706 5901806 Oh, the Samaritan.
5902006 5905406 - Gimme the goddam code.<br />- Code?
5906706 5910106 You mean for the school.<br />I'm sorry. I can't do that.
5910406 5912506 You call in that code right now...
5912806 5915706 or I blow your sick ass<br />into the next world.
5917606 5919106 If that's what you gotta do.
5932006 5935706 - You gotta take the safety catch off.<br />- Oh, goddam!
5936006 5939006 See. That works.<br />Now where's McClane?
5956607 5958307 What was that?
5962407 5964307 He said, "Don't shoot."
5964607 5968407 Okay, Charlie. We're gonna<br />have to go with the evacuation.
5968707 5971307 - We're gonna go.<br />- All right. You heard the man.<br />Let's go! Let's go!
5971607 5973007 - Move! Move! Move!<br />- We're gonna go!<br />- Let's go, men!

6008107 6012107 What are they doin'?<br />Yo, where you goin'?
6012507 6014407 - Hey, where you goin'?<br />- What's goin' on?
6014507 6018508 I see you all day, little man.<br />Policeman.
6020208 6022808 And you don't go away.
6023008 6025008 Yeah, I'm that fuckin'<br />Energizer bunny.
6027708 6030008 Where are you going now, huh?
6032508 6035608 Going to arrest me, "bunny"?
6035808 6037608 No.
6037808 6040608 I don't think<br />I'm gonna arrest you.
6040808 6043108 I'm gonna fuckin'...
6053508 6055608 I knew it was bullshit.<br />There's nobody watchin'.
6055808 6057608 Time to get Charlie out.
6057808 6060908 - Let's move, Charles. Time's up.<br />- Give me another 30 seconds.
6061308 6063308 Takes a minute-15<br />if you're a kid, Charlie.
6063408 6065808 And last I looked, you weren't too light<br />on your feet. Now move!
6067108 6069608 - Up here!<br />- Help us!<br />- Oh, my God!
6069908 6071708 - Come on!<br />- Look over here!
6071908 6074008 - Christ, get 'em outta there!<br />- Rooms are locked!
6074208 6076708 - The rooms are locked!<br />- Get outta the way!
6076908 6081408 Hey! Any one marked four!
6081708 6083508 What's goin' on, Walter?
6083708 6086008 We still have kids<br />in the building.
6091109 6093909 - I'm stayin'.<br />- No, Charlie. Get outta there.
6096009 6098709 You ever see that show<br />called The Addams Family?
6098909 6101509 They got a motherfucker on there<br />called Lurch.
6101809 6103909 You don't think I'm gonna let you<br />get to that gun, do you?
6109009 6110309 Fuck!
6129809 6131809 Help! Help! Help!
6132109 6134009 Four! Fuck it!<br />Get outta the way!
6146309 6148709 - Where are they, Walter?<br />- Still in.
6155309 6157609 No guts, no glory.
6160510 6163510 If we get to the roof,<br />we can jump to the next building!
6163910 6166910 - Shit!<br />- Outta the way.
6167210 6170310 Okay. Come on.
6170510 6172610 Get him up here. Get him up here!<br />Come on! Come on!
6172810 6176410 Mayday, mayday. Bridgeport Coast Guard.<br />Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.
6190010 6191810 Come on, kids.
6196310 6198910 - Shit, it's too far!<br />- Over here. Down.
6205510 6206810 No guts, no glory.
6207910 6209810 There's a big black-and-white fuckin'<br />boat in the middle of the harbour.
6210110 6212510 - Please stay on the line.<br />- Yeah, sure. I'll stay on the line.
6231011 6232811 Pancake syrup?
6238311 6240011 Hello, John McClane.
6241511 6243511 There was never any bomb<br />in the school, was there?
6243711 6246011 Of course not.
6246211 6248711 I'm a soldier, not a monster...
6248911 6251811 even though I sometimes work<br />for monsters.
6252111 6254911 No. The real bomb is on this ship.
6259311 6261711 Coast Guard.
6262011 6266911 I was tellin' 'em where the boat was.<br />Game over, huh?
6267311 6270211 Not quite over.
6270511 6273511 Bridgeport Coast Guard.<br />Come in, please.
6273811 6276411 They put you on hold?
6276711 6278411 She told me to stay on the line.
6282911 6286211 - Oh, God, I love this country.<br />- You know, your brother was an asshole.
6289111 6291211 - You know, he really was an asshole.<br />- He was... He was an asshole.
6291411 6295211 You, you got his number, yeah?<br />Yeah, okay.
6297411 6300811 Forgive me.<br />Would you help Mr McClane below?
6302512 6304612 Careful now.
6306012 6309412 Now, do you have the communique?
6309612 6311312 Bridgeport radio,<br />come in, please. Bridgeport.
6311612 6313312 - Coast Guard.<br />- Are you there, dear?
6313612 6317312 - Yes, we're here.<br />- Do you have the ability<br />to record a message?
6317712 6319612 - Yes.<br />- Then please begin now.
6319812 6321112 Right.
6326312 6328912 This is a communique<br />from the CRF.
6329112 6332812 For too long, the West has conspired<br />to steal the wealth of the world...
6333112 6336712 consigning the balance of humanity<br />to economic starvation.
6336912 6339612 Today, we will level<br />the playing field.
6339912 6343012 In a few minutes, the contents<br />of the Federal Reserve Bank...
6343212 6345812 the gold your economies<br />are built on...
6346112 6348812 will be redistributed by explosive...
6349112 6350912 across the bottom<br />of the Long Island Sound.
6352712 6356112 If you are not in gridlock,<br />I invite you to come and watch.
6361112 6364112 - You're gonna blow it all up?<br />- That's the idea.
6364412 6366212 There are some gentlemen<br />in the Middle East...
6366412 6369012 who seem to think that they'll make<br />a great deal of money.
6369312 6372812 See the men safely off the ship, and<br />I'll see you in the port-side launch.
6374113 6376513 The hell's all this<br />got to do with killin' McClane?
6378213 6380313 Life has its little bonuses.
6380513 6382813 Didn't I hear you say<br />you didn't even like your brother?
6383013 6385113 There's a difference, you know,<br />between not liking one's brother...
6385313 6388713 and not caring when some dumb Irish<br />flatfoot drops him out of a window.
6389113 6390913 Hey, I didn't even know<br />that motherfucker!
6391213 6393313 Yes, and I never invited you<br />aboard this ship.
6393613 6395113 No riddle is gonna stop<br />this motherfucker?
6395213 6397913 No code, no riddle,<br />no fancy little countdown.
6398313 6401813 Hey, fuck-head.<br />Yeah, you. Fuck-head.
6403513 6406713 There's just one thing<br />I gotta know.
6407013 6411613 You got any aspirins? I've had<br />a bad fuckin' headache all day long.
6414713 6416313 Must be your lucky day.
6417913 6419413 Keep the bottle.
6431813 6433513 Where is the gold?
6436213 6438213 He's betrayed us.
6438413 6441013 The containers<br />are filled with that.
6473814 6476014 If I hadn't have saved your fuckin' ass,<br />I wouldn't be sittin' here with you...
6476114 6478314 about to blow up with $100 billion<br />in fuckin' gold!
6478714 6481114 Yeah, well, I got some bad news.<br />You're only gonna blow up with me.
6481314 6483014 - What?<br />- There's no gold on this boat.
6483114 6485814 - How do you know that?<br />- 'Cause I know the man.<br />I know the family.
6486214 6490714 The only thing better than blowin' up<br />$100 billion worth of gold is makin'<br />people think you did.
6491114 6494014 - Yeah? Well, where is it?<br />- I don't know. He must have switched it<br />back on the dock somewhere.
6494314 6496114 Oh, yeah. That's supposed<br />to make me feel better?
6496314 6499314 No. You're wrong about the other thing,<br />though. You're not gonna die.
6499514 6502514 Yeah? You know<br />some cop trick about handcuffs<br />that's gonna get us outta this?
6502714 6505214 Yeah. Use a key.
6505614 6507814 - You know how to pick this lock?<br />- Is this some black shit again?
6508114 6510514 Will you stop with that racial shit?<br />Are you a fuckin' locksmith or not?
6510714 6513214 Yeah, yeah, yeah. I can do it<br />if I had somethin' to do it with.
6513414 6516414 - How about a splinter<br />of that cable I slid down?<br />- That might work.
6519515 6521715 - Hold on.<br />- Fuck are you doin'?
6525215 6528815 Oh, fuck! Shit!<br />How's that? That big enough?
6529115 6531115 Shit. Yeah.<br />Yeah, that might work.
6531315 6534315 All right. Then I'm gonna drop it<br />in your hands. Cup your hands.
6534515 6536315 Don't drop this motherfucker,<br />all right?
6536515 6539415 - Get, get it right. Come on. One...<br />- You ready? Ready?
6539615 6541615 Two... Spit it.
6541815 6545015 - Yeah! Get it?<br />- Come on. Come on. Move your hands.
6545415 6547715 All right. Okay.
6548015 6550215 Damn, McClane. You know,<br />I was just startin' to like you.
6550515 6553915 - Yeah? Well, don't. I'm an asshole.<br />- What are you talkin' about now?
6554215 6556915 - I lied to you, Zeus.<br />- About what?
6557315 6560115 You remember I said<br />Weiss found that bomb up in Harlem?
6560315 6562015 - Yeah.<br />- They found it down in Chinatown.
6562215 6565015 Oh, now that's low...<br />even for a white motherfucker like you.
6565215 6567615 I told you I was an asshole.
6567815 6569815 What the fuck was that?
6570115 6572415 I don't know.
6572615 6574615 Look, it was the only way<br />I could get you to come with me.
6574915 6576915 You got a wife, McClane?
6577215 6580115 - Yeah.<br />- I'm surprised anybody'd stay with you<br />long enough to be married.
6580415 6583415 Yeah. Well, she didn't stick around<br />too long. We're sorta separated.
6583715 6585215 What the fuck is "sorta separated"?
6585315 6588115 Well, she was in LA,<br />I was in New York.
6588416 6591916 Had a fight on the phone. She hung up.<br />I didn't call her back.
6592216 6595416 - How long ago was that?<br />- About a year ago now.
6595716 6597416 About a yea...
6599316 6601816 What the fuck<br />are you laughin' about?
6602116 6605716 You threw away your marriage<br />because you were too fuckin' stupid<br />to pick up the phone?
6606016 6608216 What, you think that's funny, huh?<br />You laugh at other people's misfortunes?
6608416 6610116 I bet you blame that shit<br />on your wife too, right?
6610316 6612316 Well, my wife<br />is a very stubborn woman, yes.
6615316 6617716 You better stop fuckin' laughin'<br />and undo these cuffs.
6618016 6620016 I'm almost there!
6620216 6622616 There! How's that for concentration?<br />Oh, shit!
6622916 6624416 - What?<br />- Fuck! I dropped the thing!
6624616 6627116 - Dropped the fucking thing?<br />- Goddam it!
6627416 6629616 - Shit! Where is it? Where did it go?<br />- Find it. Find it, all right?
6629816 6632416 I don't fuckin' see it.
6633716 6636216 What the fuck is that?
6636416 6639116 I think I made it mad.
6639416 6640816 Just go, McClane.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
6641116 6644216 - Gotta fuckin' do somethin'!<br />- Goddam it, McClane! Listen to me!
6645616 6647916 Just go.
6648116 6650716 Have a hard enough time gettin' through<br />the day without havin' your death<br />on my conscience, man.
6651016 6652916 - Shut the fuck up and think, all right?<br />- Okay, okay.
6653116 6655916 - Tools. Tools. Check the engine room.<br />- There's no time!
6657316 6659116 - What the hell's it doin' now?<br />- It's mixin'.
6659316 6660717 Shit!
6662517 6664317 - What the hell are you doin'?<br />- Get ready. Lean forward.
6664517 6666917 - What?<br />- Lean forward, goddam it!
6667117 6669017 What? The fuck you doin'?
6669217 6671017 Now it's gonna go fast.<br />Lean forward.
6671117 6673617 - Oh, no, no!<br />- Lean forward! Get ready!<br />Move your hands!

6693817 6696217 - No, damn it!<br />- Run, goddam it!
6696417 6698417 - I am, you...<br />- Come on!
6698617 6700517 - All right? Watch! Watch! Watch!<br />- Yeah.

6735318 6738118 - He's gonna be just fine.<br />- How about you?
6738418 6741118 I'm all right.<br />Did ya get Ricky out of there?
6743118 6744918 Yeah, they found him.
6746518 6749618 - Are you gonna be all right?<br />- Got a bad headache.
6749918 6752518 - Think they're mad at me?<br />- I wouldn't worry about them.
