91781 93649 Allan, bomb squad,
93716 96987 special services,<br />state police and the F.B.I.!
97053 100490 Lieutenant Jurgenson, Upummer!<br />I want you to go to St. Johns Emergency...
100556 103393 in case we got any walk-ins<br />from the street.
103459 105661 - Take that down...<br />- Kramer, get the city engineer!
105728 108598 I gotta find out a damage report.<br />It's very important.
108664 111301 Bonwit Teller. Who the hell would want to<br />blow up a department store?
111367 113669 Did you ever see a woman<br />miss a shoe sale?
113736 117007 Connie, I want you to get started<br />on the witness sheet. Ricky, you and Joe,
117073 119409 you make sure the uniforms<br />got it cordoned off there.
119475 122612 And you don't let the damn TV crews in.<br />Benson!
122678 125781 - Inspector, phone.<br />- Not now. Benson! Traffic!
125848 129619 We get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3:00,<br />or we got the traffic jam from hell!
129685 131687 - Walter!<br />- Yeah?
131754 135091 I think you'd better take this.
136959 138794 Major Case Unit,<br />Inspector Cobb.
138861 141931 Said Simple Simon to<br />the pie man going to the fair,
141998 143933 give me your pies...
144000 146602 or I'll cave your head in.
146669 150173 You see, Bonwit's was just to make sure<br />I had your attention.
150240 153609 Is there a detective<br />named McClane there?
153676 158848 - He's on suspension.<br />- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.
158914 161451 - Who is this?<br />- Call me Simon.
161517 164854 - What do you want?<br />- I want to play a game.
164920 167623 - What kind of game?<br />- Simon Says.
169359 171927 Simon's going to tell<br />Lieutenant McClane what to do,
171994 175231 and Lieutenant McClane<br />is going to do it.
175298 178768 Noncompliance<br />will result in a penalty.
178834 183606 - What penalty?<br />- Another big bang in a very public place.
186542 189445 What is it that you want<br />Lieutenant McClane to do?
189512 194750 Simon says Lieutenant McClane is to go to<br />the corner of 138th Street und Amsterdam,
194817 197620 - which is in Harlem if I'm not mistaken.<br />- Kowalski!
197687 200690 Lambert! You know<br />where to find McClane?
200756 203493 Well, I kinda doubt<br />you're gonna find him in church.
203559 206562 Well, you better find out<br />what rock he's under,
206629 208564 and kick it over.
219942 222445 John.
222512 224414 Thanks.
231421 234124 Give me some more.<br />Come on.
235291 238461 Jesus, John.<br />You look like shit.
240963 245401 Where did we leave off<br />with that roster?
245468 248938 We got three killings in<br />Red Hook the past two nights.
249004 251441 Put Miner on it.<br />And Genetti.
251507 253743 The mayor's office will call<br />before the day's out.
253809 258114 Next, 14 dump trucks stolen<br />from a yard in Staten Island.
258181 262518 Fourteen. Jesus!<br />Is somebody starting a construction company?
262585 265321 Nah, it was John's landlady<br />going to clean his apartment.
267823 270059 Insurance fraud.
270126 272595 That's a priority out in California.
272662 275064 The contractor splits the money<br />with the thieves.
275131 277167 We had that out in Jersey a couple<br />years ago, Joe. Remember?
277233 279202 See what Kelly can do with it.
281437 283773 Hey, what was the lottery<br />number last night?
283839 285608 4667.
285675 289679 You still bettin' your badge, Rick?
289745 292448 Yeah. 6991 every week.
294049 296252 6991. Lucky number.
296319 298688 Half the cops in New York<br />play their badges.
298754 300723 How are the kids, John?
302625 305428 I hear they're okay.
305495 308431 Did you talk with Holly?
309932 312202 No, I didn't talk to Holly.
312268 314504 Coming up on it, Inspector.
315871 318241 Is it hot in here<br />or am I just scared to death?
318308 320810 You want to make sure<br />the gun's secure?
320876 323413 Yeah, it's good.
330320 333823 You know, you're the first woman since Holly<br />who's seen me do this.
333889 335925 I'm honored.
335991 338394 Yeah, so was she.
340396 344867 So, where's the backup gonna be?
348204 351106 We're gonna drop back<br />to 128th Street.
351173 353676 What?
353743 356912 Ten blocks?<br />Are you fucking kidding me?
356979 359949 Oh, man, that's just great.<br />Hey, Walter, what is all this about, huh?
360015 363018 If we don't do it, this guy says<br />he's gonna blow up another public place.
363085 366456 - Well, why me? What does it got to do with me?<br />- I have no idea.
366522 368624 He just said it had to be you.
368691 372194 Well, it's nice to be needed.
372262 374129 Frankly, John,<br />you haven't been...
374196 377032 Hey, Walter, how about you mind<br />your fucking business about Holly, huh?
377099 379435 Between you and Simon,
379502 382772 you're fucking up<br />a perfectly good hangover.
385107 388210 Okay.
395585 398888 We'll be back<br />to pick you up in 15 minutes.
398954 402325 Take your time.<br />I expect to be dead in four.
402392 404794 Let's go, Billy!
426882 429151 Oh, man.
455778 458481 Hey, yo, Uncle!<br />Come look at this.
460583 464520 - It's ten after 9:00. Why aren't you in school?<br />- Tony wants to sell you this.
464587 467823 Tony? That no-neck dude<br />they call Bad T?
467890 470259 He says he found it<br />in a Dumpster.
470326 472261 He keeps stealing from people,<br />they're gonna find him in a Dumpster.
472328 475498 No, he didn't steal it.<br />He says his uncle gave it to him.
475565 478501 Hand me that newspaper over there.
481571 485508 Don't ever let people use you.<br />You're running all over town with stolen property.
485575 489379 If you get caught, you get in trouble while<br />he gets to deny the whole thing and walk away.
489445 493315 You... You mean you want us<br />to take it back to Tony?
493383 496786 No, I'll take it back to Tony,<br />with a message.
497820 499955 - Now, where you goin'?<br />- School.
500022 502124 - Why?<br />- To get educated.
502191 504394 - Why?<br />- So we can go to college.
504460 506562 - And why is that important?<br />- To get 'espect.
506629 508764 Respect.<br />Now, who's the bad guys?
508831 511333 - Guys who sell drugs.<br />- Guys who have guns.
511401 513603 - And who's the good guys?<br />- We're the good guys.
513669 515905 - Who's gonna help you?<br />- Nobody.
515971 518173 - So who's gonna help you?<br />- We're gonna help ourselves.
518240 521444 - And who do we not want to help us?<br />- White people.
521511 523579 That's right.
523646 526015 Now get on outta here.<br />Go to school.
530185 533188 - Uncle, you better come look at this.<br />- What?
533255 536325 - There's a white man standing in the street.<br />- I seen one.
536392 538428 Not like this.
548037 550706 Dial 911. Tell the police<br />to get up here quick.
550773 553909 Somebody's about to get killed.
553976 557112 - And get your butts to school. You hear me?<br />- Yeah.
557179 559314 All right.
563318 565588 You better back off, man.
583473 587142 - Morning.<br />- Good morning.
587209 589979 You having a nice day, sir?<br />You feeling all right?
590045 592882 Not to get too personal,
592948 595084 but a white man standing<br />in the middle of Harlem...
595150 597553 wearing a sign that says<br />I Hate Niggers...
597620 601190 has either got some serious personal issues<br />or not all his dogs are barking.
601256 603258 Hey!
603325 607963 I'm talkin' to you! Now you got about<br />10 seconds before those guys see you.
608030 610933 When they do, they will kill you.<br />You understand?
611000 614236 You are about to have<br />a very bad day.
614303 616539 Tell me about it.
616606 619408 Sir, this is a police matter.<br />For your own safety, I'm gonna ask you...
619475 621911 - to step across the street.<br />- You're damn right it's a police matter!
621977 625314 For your own safety, I suggest you hide your butt<br />in my shop till the police get here.
625380 628250 What the fuck!
628317 631020 Aw, shit!
637159 639161 - Listen, I'm a cop.<br />- What?
639228 641931 I'm on a case. Somebody blew up<br />Bonwit Teller's an hour ago.
641997 644399 - Did you hear about that on the news?<br />- Yeah.
644466 646736 The same asshole who did that said<br />I gotta do this or he's gonna blow up something else.
646802 648403 - Do you understand?<br />- Shit.
648470 650305 - Listen, I got a gun...<br />- They got 10 guns.
650372 652274 - You should get across the street!<br />- Look, start acting crazy.
652341 654610 - What?<br />- Like Looney Tunes. You know, like Bellevue?
654677 659214 - Hey, Zeus, this a friend of yours?<br />- He look like a friend of mine?
659281 663252 I think the dude just escaped<br />from some hospital, you know? Like Bellevue?
667623 671894 I am the voice of my own god.
671961 674029 And my god...
674096 676431 I told the librarian that I had a bad headache,<br />but she didn't believe me.
676498 679334 I really do have a bad headache though.<br />I have a very bad headache!
679401 681771 - And my head does not feel...<br />- Oh, man, you shut the fuck...
681837 685107 You've made a very bad mistake.
685174 687743 Poke it through his head.
687810 690212 Cut this shit off him!
690279 693348 Fellas! Fellas!<br />Nature boy here hates niggers.
693415 695350 Now, what are we<br />gonna do about that?
695417 697519 Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo!<br />Hold up! Hold up!
697587 700222 Oh, shit!
703659 705661 - Back! Back up!<br />- Hey, what are you trippin' on?
705728 708698 Back the fuck up! Now!
708764 711867 Come on, man. Get up.
711934 715337 Get up! Get outta here!
715404 717439 Stop the c...<br />Stop the goddamn cab!
717506 720576 - Don't shoot! Don't shoot me! Don't shoot!<br />- Get up! Come on! Get up!
720643 722544 Back up! I mean it!
722612 725781 I don't want to, but I will!<br />You know I will! Come on, drive! Drive!
725848 728450 - Drive!<br />- Get the fuck outta here!
728517 731220 Drive! Drive!
731286 734523 Don't stop, don't stop! Just keep driving!<br />Run the red light! Drive!
734590 736859 - That's all I got!<br />- Put that fuckin' money away! Nobody's robbing you, asshole.
736926 738961 - Don't kill me!<br />- Shit!
739028 742698 - Just run all the lights! Drive!<br />- Oh, man! Damn!
742765 744734 - That cut deep?<br />- How the hell would I know?
744800 747136 Just keep pressure on it.
747202 749004 Oh, fuck! Goddamn!
749071 751073 Jesús, right?
751140 753375 - John McClane. I owe you one...<br />- Damn right, you owe me!
753442 756278 - You got any idea what those guys are doing to my shop right now?<br />- Chill out, Jesús!
756345 758914 Chill out? What the fuck? Are you trying to<br />relate to me? Talk like a white man!
758981 760983 Jesús, I'm sorry<br />you got involved, all right?
761050 762985 Why do you keep calling me Jesús?<br />I look Puerto Rican to you?
763052 765487 - Guy back there called you Jesús, didn't he?<br />- He didn't say Jesús!
765554 768257 He said, hey, Zeus!<br />My name is Zeus.
768323 771927 - Zeus?<br />- Yeah, Zeus! As in father of Apollo? Mt. Olympus?
771994 774830 Don't fuck with me or<br />I'll shove a lightning bolt up your ass!
774897 777299 Zeus! You got<br />a problem with that?
777366 780502 - No, I don't have a problem with that.<br />- Shit!
780569 782537 Downtown. Police Plaza.
782604 784740 Oh, that's just great.
788744 791180 Get a record of all his collars,<br />recent releases...
791246 794249 and a list of anybody else<br />he might have looked at sideways.
795851 797920 It's a textbook megalomania.
797987 800856 It's a pathological state<br />in which fantasies of control...
800923 803225 or omnipotence predominate.
803292 806696 He wants control over him,<br />over his actions, his thoughts, even his emotions.
806762 808563 Sounds like you got<br />a secret admirer, John.
808630 810632 Yeah, maybe he'll send me some flowers.
810700 813936 - Everybody knows you like pansies.<br />- It's not that kind of emotion.
814003 816338 - This guy is ugly.<br />- How is that?
816405 819241 Nothing wrong with him<br />a shower wouldn't cure.
819308 821443 Beer is normally<br />taken internally, John.
821510 825380 - Just get me some aspirins, will ya?<br />- Okay. Hold this here.
825447 830152 - This is Fred Schiller, John. He's a...<br />- A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
830219 833555 Yes, I was saying that we're dealing with<br />a megalomaniacal personality...
833622 835390 with possible<br />paranoid schizophrenia.
835457 837559 Hey, how about we just<br />skip down to the part...
837626 839795 where you tell me what the fuck<br />this has to do with me, huh?
839862 843999 I don't know. I mean, what I do know<br />is it does have specifically to do with you.
844066 846601 This guy wants to pound<br />on you till you crumble.
846668 850773 - He wants you to dance to his tune, and then...<br />- Put on a dress and fuck me?
850840 854944 I was going to say kill you.
855010 857813 He's sitting on<br />an awful lot of rage,
857880 861216 and it could be manifested physically<br />if he's stressed.
861283 863919 Someone he arrested?<br />Somebody he pissed off?
863986 867056 - That could be one hell of a long list.<br />- Fuck you, Joe.
867122 869792 See, these people don't like<br />to work anonymously.
869859 871994 They want you to know<br />who's doing it to you.
872061 875965 So this name Simon is probably not an alias.<br />It's probably Simon or some variation.
876031 880102 Simon, Robert E.<br />Busted in '86, extortion, kidnapping, 10 to 15.
880169 884506 Did seven years for good behavior.<br />Released on a state work-furlough two months ago.
884573 886575 - Check it.<br />- Thanks, Rick.
886641 889578 Bob Simons was a bankrupt businessman<br />who kidnapped his partner's daughter.
889644 892614 He's a fuck-up, not a psycho.<br />The guy we're looking for is nuts.
892681 895650 A nut who knows a lot<br />about bombs.
895717 898487 We found this in a playground.<br />Professional.
898553 902024 Very cool stuff.<br />You know, boom!
902091 905795 - You think you should slam it around like that, Charlie?<br />- It's unmixed. You can't hurt it.
905861 908297 This stuff is cutting edge.<br />It's a binary liquid.
908363 913468 - A what?<br />- Like epoxy, two liquids.
913535 916171 Now, either one by itself...
917406 920976 you got nothing,<br />but mix 'em...
932121 935757 Ricky?
937659 940729 Charlie, you're gonna be wearing<br />that chair up your ass!
940796 944033 - Christ Almighty, Charlie!<br />- Like I said, very cool stuff.
944099 946668 Now, with a package like this,<br />you get a warning.
946735 950840 Now, the bomb has to arm itself.<br />You'll see the red liquid...
950906 953275 pump into the clear<br />before it detonates.
953342 956745 - How long before?<br />- Ten seconds, two minutes.
956812 958814 It could be anything.
958881 961851 But once it's mixed,<br />be somewhere else.
961917 964186 That stuff has gotta<br />be pretty rare.
964253 967189 We oughta be able to find out if<br />any of it's missing somewhere.
967256 969391 Already did.<br />Livermore Labs theft over the weekend.
969458 971861 He got enough to make<br />another one, Joe?
971927 975030 - About 2,000 pounds.<br />- Of that?
975097 978733 The detonating mechanism could be<br />anything... radio, electrical.
978800 981270 Hell, you could use a beeper<br />and phone it in.
981336 983505 Inspector?<br />Inspector, it's him.
983572 985740 He's got a double Alberti<br />feedback loop on it.
985807 987943 - A nasty little trick I believe once used in Lebanon.<br />- Charlie. Charlie!
988010 990145 - Charlie, shh!<br />- What...
990212 992514 You wanna start the trace?
998653 1000789 Simon.
1000856 1004226 He wore the board,<br />walked the street and survived.
1004293 1007596 Where are my pigeons now?
1007662 1009664 Pigeons?
1009731 1013402 I had two pigeons, bright and gay,<br />fly from me the other day.
1013468 1016838 Why was it they did go?<br />You cannot tell. You do not know.
1016906 1020842 - You mean McClane?<br />- No, I mean Santa Claus.
1023345 1026781 - Yeah, I'm here.<br />- Ah, there after all. And your friend?
1026848 1029084 Carver! Carver!
1029151 1031753 Come on. We need you in the other room.<br />Let's go! Come on!
1031820 1033655 They need you. Go.
1033722 1036591 - Yeah, he's here too.<br />- And may I speak with him?
1038760 1042664 - Well, is the ebony Samaritan there now?<br />- You got a problem with ebony?
1042731 1046035 No, no. My only problem<br />is that I went to some trouble...
1046101 1048237 preparing that game<br />for McClane.
1048303 1050605 You interfered with<br />a well-laid plan.
1050672 1054876 Yeah? Well, you can stick your well-laid<br />plan up your well-laid ass.
1057212 1060582 That was not smart.<br />There are lives at stake here!
1060649 1062651 Not enough time, Inspector.
1062717 1064920 You better hope<br />he calls back.
1064987 1067589 He will.
1067656 1071860 Ricky, you wanna tell those people<br />to shut the hell up out there?
1071927 1074829 Hey, keep it down here!
1083038 1086341 Simon, he wasn't speaking<br />for all of us.
1086408 1089578 That was unpleasant.<br />Don't let it happen again.
1089644 1091813 So, what's your name, boy?
1091880 1094083 - Don't call me boy.<br />- I'm sorry.
1094149 1096685 It was a poor attempt at humor.
1096751 1098853 I was going to send<br />you home with a chiding,
1098920 1101556 - but now I think perhaps you should join the game.<br />- We got him!
1101623 1103725 It's a pay phone in Oslo.
1103792 1105927 - No, wait, they say it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Norway?
1105995 1109531 - Wait. Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Forget it!
1109598 1112501 Australia? He's scrambling up their system.<br />They don't know where he is.
1112567 1115837 Having fun with<br />the phone company, are we?
1115904 1118440 Simon says,<br />McClane and the Samaritan...
1118507 1121643 will go to the subway station<br />at 72nd and Broadway.
1121710 1125214 I will call you in 15 minutes<br />on the pay phone outside the station.
1125280 1128817 No police. Failure to answer will<br />constitute noncompliance.
1128883 1131353 Do you understand me, John?
1131420 1134456 Oh, yes, I understand.<br />I understand that you're a fuckin' wacko...
1134523 1136758 that likes to play kids' games,<br />that's what I understand.
1136825 1138860 - Hardly.<br />- Hardly?
1138927 1142264 Well, then, who are you?<br />Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?
1142331 1144866 Shoplifting?<br />Purse snatching?
1144933 1146868 Cross-dressing? What?
1146935 1151206 You couldn't catch me<br />if I stole your chair with you in it.
1151273 1154376 My chair with me in it?<br />That's very exciting.
1154443 1156911 Let me ask you a question, bonehead.
1156978 1159148 Why are you trying to kill me?
1159214 1161283 John, John, calm yourself.
1161350 1164386 Why don't you come on down here<br />and we'll figure this out like a couple of men?
1164453 1166455 Just come on down here.
1166521 1169391 - If killing you was all I wanted, you'd be dead by now.<br />- Simon.
1169458 1173095 This is Inspector Cobb.<br />I can appreciate your feelings for McClane,
1173162 1175730 but believe me,<br />the jerk isn't worth it.
1175797 1178467 He stepped on so many toes<br />in this department,
1178533 1181136 by this time next month<br />he's going to be a security guard.
1181203 1183438 His own wife wants nothing<br />to do with him,
1183505 1186475 and he's about two steps shy of becoming<br />a full-blown alcoholic.
1186541 1189010 One step. One step!
1189078 1191380 Now listen to me.
1191446 1195084 You sound like a real smart guy.<br />What is it that you want?
1195150 1197186 Are you talking about money?
1197252 1200021 Well, whatever, whatever.
1200089 1202924 McClane is a toilet bug.
1202991 1206561 Now what would it take just to forget him<br />and live happily ever after?
1206628 1208763 You know,<br />money is shit to me.
1208830 1213001 I would not give up McClane<br />for all the gold in your Fort Knox.
1213068 1215737 72nd Street subway,<br />pay phone, 15 minutes.
1215804 1218073 McClane and the Samaritan.
1218140 1220975 If you're competent in the least,<br />you've found the briefcase.
1221042 1223912 So you know what I mean<br />by penalty.
1226415 1229050 I wanna thank you for that<br />vote of confidence, Walter.
1229118 1232487 Well, I thought it was worth a try.<br />This guy's a raving maniac.
1232554 1234856 He couldn't be any clearer<br />if he got it from a case history.
1234923 1238160 He gave you clues to his identity.<br />He spoke German.
1238227 1242231 He called it your Fort Knox.<br />And he stammered when McClane pushed him.
1242297 1245234 Now, you believe this guy<br />really can't be bought?
1245300 1249304 There's no chance. The very mention of money<br />only enraged him further.
1256511 1259648 - What's that?<br />- It's your shield.
1259714 1262684 - You asking me to be a cop again, Walter?<br />- Ricky, get him his gun.
1262751 1265254 - You didn't answer my question.<br />- Joe, this time they go with back...
1265320 1269324 Hey! You didn't answer<br />my question, Walter.
1269391 1271393 Are you done, Lieutenant?
1271460 1273795 Now, you two better get going...
1273862 1276265 if you're going to get up<br />to 72nd Street on time.
1276331 1278900 - Joe, this time they go with backup.<br />- You got it.
1278967 1281736 - Come on, you guys!<br />- I'm not going anywhere.
1281803 1285807 - Simon says you gotta go!<br />- I'm not jumping through hoops for some psycho.
1285874 1288710 That's a white man with white problems.<br />You deal with him.
1288777 1291045 Call me when he crosses<br />110th Street.
1291112 1293848 Hey!<br />Why'd you save my ass?
1293915 1298019 I didn't. I stopped a white cop from<br />getting killed in Harlem.
1298086 1300755 One white cop gets killed today,
1300822 1303892 tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,<br />all of them with itchy trigger fingers.
1303958 1306661 Got it?
1306728 1309364 Get him back.
1309431 1312901 - Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?<br />- Chinatown.
1312967 1315069 Shit.
1315136 1318072 Zeus! Yo, partner!<br />Wait up!
1318139 1320175 Hey, hey, hey, hey.<br />I ain't your partner.
1320242 1324713 I ain't your neighbor, your brother or your friend.<br />I'm your total stranger.
1324779 1326948 Okay. Stranger,
1327015 1330652 you know where that park is<br />at 115th Street and St. Nicholas?
1332120 1334189 Yeah, it's in Harlem.
1334256 1336958 Where do you think<br />we found that bomb?
1337025 1342397 Listen, this guy doesn't care<br />about skin color, even if you do.
1344599 1348203 - What am I doin'?<br />- Cheer up. Things could be worse.
1348270 1350805 I was working on<br />a nice, fat suspension,
1350872 1353975 smokin' cigarettes<br />and watching Captain Kangaroo.
1354042 1356177 Come on.
1358213 1360382 Is that the phone?
1362050 1365754 They made it to the phone.
1365820 1368690 - But there's a problem.<br />- What do you mean? How big a problem?
1368757 1370792 Oh, about 300 pounds.
1370859 1372827 Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
1372894 1374896 - We need this phone for official police business.<br />- Do you mind?
1374963 1376965 - Honey, I'm a cop. I need the phone right now...<br />- I'm sorry, but I...
1377031 1380402 - Get off the damn phone, lady! Police business!<br />- Well, I never!
1380469 1384839 - I can get used to this.<br />- I'm sure you can find a phone across the street, ma'am.
1384906 1387609 Let's get something straight.<br />I'm the only one here on official police business.
1387676 1390412 - Don't ever do that shit again.<br />- Let's get something else straight.
1390479 1394583 You need me a lot more than I need you.<br />You don't like the way I do things, fine.
1394649 1397486 I quit.
1402557 1405994 All right, I need you.
1412434 1415804 All right, I need you more<br />than you need me.
1418740 1420675 Hello.
1420742 1423378 Birds of a feather flock together.<br />So do pigs and swine.
1423445 1426681 Rats and mice have their chance,<br />as will I have mine.
1426748 1428683 Nice. It rhymes.
1428750 1432354 - Why was the phone busy? Who were you calling?<br />- The psychic hotline.
1432421 1434423 I'd advise you to take this<br />more seriously.
1434489 1436591 Look, it's a public phone!<br />What do you want me to say?
1436658 1440495 You can simply say there was a fat woman on it<br />and it took you a minute to get her off!
1442096 1445300 Now, John,<br />there's a significant amount of explosive...
1445367 1447636 in the trash receptacle<br />next to you.
1449504 1452006 Try to run,<br />and it goes up now.
1452073 1455677 - Nobody's gonna run, but I got 100 people out here.<br />- That's the point.
1455744 1458079 Now, do I have your attention?
1458146 1460682 As I was going to St. Ives,<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1460749 1464753 Every wife had seven sacks. Every sack<br />had seven cats. Every cat had seven kittens.
1464819 1467922 Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.<br />How many were going to St. Ives?
1467989 1471693 - My phone number is 555...<br />- No, no, no! Wait! I didn't get all that! Say it again!
1471760 1475630 - Not a chance. My phone number is 555 and the answer.<br />- But I didn't...
1475697 1478166 Call me in 30 seconds or die.
1480402 1482737 All right, seven guys<br />with seven wives...
1482804 1485306 - Shut up, McClane. I'm good at this.<br />- Seven guys with seven wives...
1485374 1487942 Shut the fuck up, McClane!<br />He said seven wives with seven sacks.
1488009 1491880 - Seven times seven is 49. Now tell me the rest.<br />- A sack with seven...
1491946 1494048 - Weren't you listening?<br />- Yeah! I didn't hear every fuckin'...
1494115 1496284 - What is wrong with you?<br />- Besides having a bad fucking hangover, for one thing!
1496351 1498420 All right, all right!
1498487 1502090 Seven wives times seven, 49.<br />With seven cats. Seven times 49 is 343, right?
1502156 1504225 - Are you asking me or telling me?<br />- I'm telling you.
1504292 1507996 343 times seven is...<br />One, zero, 24. 2401!
1508062 1510632 - That's what you got, right?<br />- Yeah, that's what I got.
1510699 1512634 - Is that it, 2401?<br />- That's it. Dial.
1512701 1515103 555-2401.
1517138 1519474 - No, wait, wait! It's a trick, it's a trick.<br />- What? What do you mean?
1519541 1522811 - I forgot about the man.<br />- What man? Fuck the man! We got 10 seconds!
1522877 1525179 He said, how many were going<br />to St. Ives, right?
1525246 1529183 As I was going to St. Ives,<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1529250 1531986 - The guy and his wives aren't going anywhere.<br />- What are they doing?
1532053 1534723 Sittin' in the fuckin' road waiting on...<br />How the hell should I know, McClane?
1534789 1537892 - Who's going to St. Ives then?<br />- The guy. Just the guy.
1537959 1540294 - Just one guy? Just one guy.<br />- The answer's one.
1540361 1542664 - How do you dial one?<br />- 555-0001.
1542731 1545133 Zero, zero, one.<br />Just one guy's goin'?
1545199 1548302 - Hello, John.<br />- Yeah, piece of cake! Give us something harder next time.
1548369 1552173 - But you're 10 seconds late.<br />- No, no! The answer is one!
1552240 1555410 There's a bomb in the trash!<br />Get down!
1555477 1557612 Get down!
1557679 1559881 There's a bomb!
1559948 1562751 Get down!<br />There's a bomb!
1565587 1567989 Welcome to New York.
1571993 1575864 Here, you can have it.<br />Come on. Come on. Let's go.
1589978 1592046 No bomb.
1597752 1601656 - Yeah.<br />- I didn't say, Simon says.
1601723 1606394 It's 9:50, John.<br />The number 3 train is arriving now.
1606461 1609798 I left something provocative<br />on that train, John.
1609864 1612701 Simon says,<br />get to the pay phone...
1612767 1615837 next to the news kiosk in<br />Wall Street station by 10:20,
1615904 1619140 or the number 3 train<br />and its passengers vaporize.
1619207 1622811 Use any means of travel other than civilian,<br />I blow the train.
1622877 1625614 Attempt to evacuate the subway,<br />I blow the train.
1625680 1630084 - I'll call you in 30 minutes. Be there.<br />- We're fucked.
1630151 1633488 Ninety blocks in 30 minutes<br />in New York traffic?
1633555 1635790 It could be double that.
1635857 1638627 We don't even have a car!
1638693 1640695 Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!<br />I'm a cop! I'm a cop!
1640762 1643031 - I am requisitioning this car for official police business.<br />- What are you doing?
1643097 1645233 - Thank you very much.<br />- What the fuck are you doing to my car?
1645299 1647035 - Get in, get in!<br />- Pretty slick.
1647101 1650071 I used to drive a cab.<br />The fastest way south is...
1650138 1653542 What the fuck are you doing?
1657245 1659347 What were you saying?
1659413 1663384 I was saying, I used to drive a cab,<br />and Ninth Avenue was the fastest way south.
1663451 1665754 But we seem to be going east.
1669490 1672226 Where the hell<br />are you going, McClane?
1672293 1674596 I told you Ninth Avenue<br />was the quickest way south!
1674663 1677031 Stop with that goddamn yelling!<br />I know what I'm doing!
1677098 1678800 Not even God knows<br />what you're doing!
1678867 1681502 They're headed east on 72nd<br />towards the park.
1681570 1684906 - But Wall Street is south!<br />- Man, stop yelling at me! I got a bad headache.
1684973 1688042 And the best way south is not Ninth Avenue.<br />It's through the park.
1690211 1694716 Oh, dear. I told you that<br />Park Drive is always jammed.
1694783 1698787 I didn't say Park Drive.
1698853 1701122 I said through the park.
1703992 1706861 Shit! We lost 'em.<br />They're in the park headed south.
1706928 1709363 Get outta here!
1709430 1711766 Fucking prick!
1717138 1719774 I got him, Connie.<br />He's taking the scenic route.
1719841 1722410 - Outta the way!<br />- Oh, man.
1725013 1727582 Get out...<br />Get out of the way.
1732587 1734689 Watch it, watch it,<br />watch it, watch it, watch it!
1734756 1736557 Are you aiming<br />for these people?
1736625 1738727 No. Well, maybe that mime.
1741362 1743031 Tree! Tree! Tree!
1747435 1749070 What's goin' on here?
1751673 1753574 Look out!
1753642 1757145 Tree! Tree!
1757211 1759814 - Just hang on.<br />- Rock! Rock! Rock!
1765787 1769257 Hey, look out!
1769323 1772694 McClane!<br />McClane, watch it.
1777565 1780501 McClane!
1785573 1788209 - Out of the way.<br />- How do Catholics do their thing?
1788276 1792613 - North, south, west, east. How much time?<br />- Twenty-seven minutes.
1792681 1796384 72nd and Broadway to Central Park South<br />in three minutes!
1796450 1799821 That's gotta be<br />a fuckin' record.
1799888 1801723 Aw, get out!
1801790 1804192 Yeah.
1804258 1806260 Now what?
1812000 1814435 - We need a fire truck.<br />- What?
1814502 1816871 To follow!
1819741 1823778 - 911.<br />- Lt. John McClane, N.Y.P.D., access number 7479.
1823845 1827148 Calling from a civilian transmitter.<br />Get me an emergency dispatcher right away.
1827215 1829283 Dispatch. Go ahead.
1829350 1831920 I got two officers down at the corner<br />of 14th Street and Ninth Avenue!
1831986 1834422 Need an ambulance! Over!
1834488 1836858 Emergency calls on the west side go to<br />Roosevelt Hospital. That's two blocks from here.
1864052 1866154 Slow the fuck down, McClane!
1866220 1868222 - Kinda like football, isn't it?<br />- What?
1868289 1871225 Get yourself a blocker<br />and head for the end zone!
1873494 1876364 If you'd said Wall Street,<br />we could've followed him all the way.
1876430 1878833 Wrong! South of 14th Street's<br />a different hospital.
1878900 1881903 It's St. Luke's. Hang on.
1890211 1892046 Time?
1892113 1894315 10:02.
1894382 1898920 - We're halfway there with 18 minutes to go.<br />- Fuck this! Hang on.
1910832 1912934 Hang on.
1913001 1915636 - Get out of there!<br />- Slide over and take the wheel.
1915703 1918406 - Where you going?<br />- We should be ahead of that train. Right?
1918472 1920441 - You're not gonna get on that train...<br />- I'm gonna get on that train!
1920508 1922743 - You gotta get to that pay phone by 10:20!<br />- What are you gonna do?
1922811 1925713 I'm gonna get that bomb! Listen, you fail,<br />I cover your ass. I fail, you cover my ass.
1925780 1928516 And if we both fail?
1928582 1932686 Then we're both fucked. Go now! Drive!<br />Get to that phone booth by 10:20!
1932753 1936090 - Go!<br />- My lucky fuckin' day.
1939493 1941863 Shit! Look out!<br />Get out!
1944498 1946400 Look out! Look out!
1946467 1949370 Look out!<br />Get out of the way!
1952941 1956777 This is a bad idea!
1983037 1985106 - Excuse me! Excuse me!<br />- Hey!
1985173 1988276 Just get out of the way, please!
2000021 2002190 112 Wall Street.
2002256 2005159 Wait. This isn't a taxi.<br />You don't understand.
2005226 2007561 Your light's on.<br />I'll make it simple.
2007628 2011265 112 Wall Street, or I'll have<br />your medallion suspended.
2011332 2014402 What, you don't like<br />white people?
2014468 2016905 112 Wall Street?
2016971 2019073 You got it.
2022410 2024445 Come on.

2138126 2141195 Hey, listen, bro,<br />I was here first.

2173894 2176430 I'm gonna ask you to calmly<br />and quietly start moving...
2176497 2178399 towards the other<br />end of the car.

2196150 2199153 Look, if you have to shoot me,

2202623 2205493 But I have to answer this phone!
2205559 2208529 All right?
2212566 2214402 I'm here.
2214468 2217338 - And McClane?<br />- He's on his way.
2217405 2219907 You know, he's a little slow.<br />He's kinda out of shape.
2219973 2224745 The rules applied to both of you.<br />I'm afraid this is noncompliance.
2224812 2227748 Good-bye.
2233254 2235389 Trust me, guys.
2236890 2239527 Duck.
2273861 2277565 Hey, get outta there! Get outta there!<br />Duck, asshole!
2327248 2330017 McClane?
2336357 2339026 What...
2342730 2345599 You can see right down<br />into the subway.
2345666 2347968 - How many fire trucks do you count?<br />- You guys! You guys!
2348035 2350070 How can you see it<br />from up here?
2350137 2352473 Damn! Get in there.
2352540 2356109 Officer, tell those people<br />to get the hell back, will ya?
2356176 2359146 We got a shitload of cuts and bruises,<br />a couple concussions,
2359213 2362182 some old guy's pacemaker stopped,<br />and a pregnant girl's water broke.
2362250 2364385 And that's all.<br />How are you doin', John?
2364452 2366787 I still can't hear too good.
2366854 2368822 Well, it's a miracle<br />you're still alive.
2368889 2371124 - It's a goddamn miracle.<br />- Yeah, that's the problem, Joe.
2371191 2373661 - What?<br />- The miracle part.
2373727 2376297 What are the odds of us<br />making it down here on time?
2376364 2378932 Zip.
2378999 2382370 That bomb was gonna go off no matter what.<br />He wanted it to go off right down here.
2382436 2384838 Take this off me, Dave.
2384905 2387675 Well, what's so special<br />about this place?
2387741 2389643 - I don't know. Something just doesn't add up.<br />- Lt. McClane?
2389710 2392913 They're asking for you<br />and a Mr. Carver.
2392980 2395983 Where?
2396049 2398252 John?
2399487 2403324 John, this is Andy Cross<br />with the F.B.I.
2403391 2405293 This is Mr. Jarvis.<br />He's...
2405359 2407895 I'm with another agency.
2407961 2411965 - It's good to meet you.<br />- This is Lieutenant McClane. This is Mr. Carver.
2413801 2416537 We got a couple of<br />questions first.
2416604 2419239 Do you recognize this guy?
2421709 2424244 No.
2424312 2426580 How about this one?
2431485 2433654 How about you?
2434955 2437691 Did you recognize<br />the voice on the phone?
2437758 2439693 No.
2439760 2443931 Did you notice any cars<br />following you?
2443997 2446600 No.
2446667 2449770 Anybody following you at all?<br />Any kind of surveillance?
2449837 2453006 Telephone? House?<br />Anything unusual at all?
2453073 2456009 Well,
2456076 2458912 now that you mention it,<br />I have experienced a...
2458979 2461715 you know, like a burning<br />sensation between my toes.
2461782 2465586 I thought it was just some athlete's foot<br />or something. I don't know.
2467855 2471091 We read your jacket, Lieutenant.<br />We were told you would be cooperative.
2471158 2473561 - Cooperate with what?<br />- Hey, now wait a minute. He will be.
2473627 2476063 We're just wasting time here<br />in this goddamn van.
2476129 2479299 You want to share information,<br />how about sending a little our way as well?
2479367 2481569 We wanna hear<br />what he knows first.
2481635 2483837 - What the hell? You give us pictures and then...<br />- We want to hear what he knows.
2483904 2487508 Hey, I know as much<br />as you know. All right?
2487575 2490210 There's a guy out there<br />setting off bombs.
2490277 2493714 He calls himself Simon.<br />He speaks with a German accent.
2493781 2496684 And for some reason,<br />he's very angry with me.
2496750 2499787 Now, maybe you can tell me<br />why, fellas.
2504992 2508161 The first man there<br />is Methias Targo.
2508228 2511164 Was Hungarian army.<br />Explosives expert.
2511231 2513401 - Now we believe he's working for the Iranians.<br />- Working?
2513467 2516069 Freelance terrorism.<br />By contract.
2517938 2520441 - Who's the girl?<br />- Targo's other half.
2520508 2524277 Rumor is Israelis slipped a bomb in<br />between their sheets. He wasn't at home,
2524344 2526414 but they think<br />maybe they got her.
2526480 2530551 The second man was an obscure<br />colonel in the East German Army.
2530618 2534588 He ran an infiltration unit. The kind of thing<br />the Nazis did at the Battle of the Bulge.
2534655 2536657 English-speaking troops...
2536724 2539359 Yeah, yeah,<br />I saw the movie.
2539427 2544498 All we know of him is the G.D.R. medical records<br />show he suffers from migraines.
2544565 2547468 His name is Peter Krieg.
2549937 2553407 Well, that is<br />an exceptional report, fellas.
2553474 2556376 Now, do you want to tell me<br />what the hell this has to do with me?
2556444 2558946 The name Gruber mean<br />anything to you, Lieutenant?
2563316 2565619 It rings a bell, yeah.
2565686 2567721 - L.A.<br />- What?
2567788 2570157 That thing in<br />the building in L.A.
2571992 2574061 Peter Krieg...
2574127 2578131 was born Simon Peter Gruber.
2578198 2582470 He's Hans Gruber's brother.
2585038 2587475 Holy shit.
2587541 2590678 Yeah, it's that thing in L.A.
2590744 2593647 We figure he's got you<br />fitted up for a toe tag,
2593714 2596750 and he's gonna do anything<br />to get it tied.
2596817 2599853 Inspector!<br />Inspector, it's him.
2601822 2603791 Don't let him know<br />we're here.
2606359 2609963 - Simon.<br />- Inspector.
2610030 2613033 Now, who from the F.B.I.<br />is in the van, I wonder?
2613100 2616236 Let's see. Almost certainly Cross.<br />Come on, Andrew. Say hello.
2616303 2618205 Hello.
2618271 2621609 And I know you never run alone,<br />so say hello, Bill.
2621675 2624712 Still trying to butch up by<br />chewing on your glasses, huh?
2626880 2631585 This, gentlemen, as they say,<br />is where the plot thickens.
2631652 2635388 I have put 2,400 pounds of explosive<br />in one of the 1,446 schools...
2635455 2637491 in greater New York.
2637558 2641829 It is fitted with a timer set to explode<br />at exactly 3:00 p.m.
2643130 2645766 Thank you. Your silence<br />says I'm understood.
2645833 2648569 Did you say 2,400 pounds?
2648636 2650804 Yes, but please don't<br />interrupt again!
2650871 2653941 Simon says, if you attempt<br />to evacuate schools,
2654007 2655976 the bomb will be detonated<br />by radio.
2656043 2658278 And, gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.
2658345 2662550 Repeat, one school will be dismissed<br />at 3:00 p.m. permanently, unless...
2662616 2664652 Unless what?
2664718 2667320 Unless John McClane and his new best friend<br />complete the tasks I set them.
2667387 2668989 John, are you listening?
2671792 2676463 - Yeah.<br />- The pay phone beyond Hope, Tompkins Square Park.
2676530 2679299 Twenty minutes.<br />Go by foot. No rush.
2679366 2683503 If you're really clever, you'll learn<br />the location of the bomb and the code to disarm it.
2683571 2685773 Oh, and by the way, gentlemen,
2685839 2688842 we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.
2688909 2693747 The only problem is the darn things seem to<br />respond to police and F.B.I. frequencies.
2693814 2696784 So if I were you,<br />I'd keep off your radios.
2696850 2699286 Simon, wait.
2702956 2705993 2,400 pounds of that liquid stuff.
2706059 2709496 My God.<br />Get me the commissioner.
2709563 2712265 He's doing a press conference.<br />He's supposed to be here in half an hour.
2712332 2715869 Ricky, get every senior officer on the site.<br />Get 'em here right away.
2715936 2718572 You're not gonna give me<br />any jurisdictional nonsense on this?
2718639 2722876 I got two kids in the school on 64th Street.<br />What can I do to help you?
2722943 2725178 - How many men have you got?<br />- Seventy-five.
2725245 2727715 But if I push the panic button,<br />I can get 500 from Washington.
2727781 2730317 - When?<br />- 2:30, 3:00.
2730383 2732285 Between now and then...
2732352 2736757 We're gonna have to do this<br />all by ourselves. Let's go.
2736824 2740293 Now, Tompkins Square Park is more than<br />two miles away, so you guys better get running.
2740360 2742963 No radios.<br />You take my telephone.
2743030 2746233 You get anything, you call me<br />through the switchboard. Good luck.
2746299 2749069 Thanks.<br />Find that bomb.
2749136 2751839 - Ricky, where are they?<br />- Right over here.
2751905 2754307 - The senior man present is Chief Allen.<br />- Chief of what?
2754374 2756677 - Transit.<br />- Okay, thanks, Ricky.
2756744 2759613 Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.<br />Chief Allen.
2759680 2762282 The man who has done this<br />has told us...
2762349 2767354 that he has planted another very large bomb<br />in a school here in the New York area.
2767420 2771859 And he has told us that we cannot evacuate,<br />but he has not said that we cannot search.
2771925 2774795 Now, I recommend we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody...
2774862 2779032 I'm talking about police, transit,<br />sanitation, fire, even the goddamn librarians...
2779099 2783170 and we start searching schools,<br />and I mean right now.
2783236 2785873 I'm talking about 1,000 buildings<br />within the city limits.
2785939 2788475 And we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it in.
2788541 2791578 Now, I'd like to keep the media<br />out of this as long as possible,
2791645 2794347 because if they get in,<br />we've got a panic.
2794414 2796383 Are we in agreement?
2796449 2799586 Come on, guys! Let's go!
2799653 2801989 Move it out!<br />Move it out!
2802055 2805258 No radio contact.<br />No radio contact.
2814567 2817370 They bought it.
2817437 2819606 You can begin.
2834521 2836857 Hook, line...
2839960 2842662 and sinker.
2847134 2849770 All right now, men, let's go!<br />Let's go!
2883570 2886840 Sergeant Turley!<br />Sergeant Turley!
2886907 2890010 In the last five minutes,<br />the volume in calls in here has tripled!
2890077 2893881 - What the hell is goin' on?<br />- Stop. Let me explain.
2893947 2897417 For the rest of the day, we're supposed<br />to handle the department's communications.
2897484 2901088 - What do you mean handle?<br />- They're shutting down the police band.
2901154 2903690 All calls will be coming<br />through this switchboard.
2903757 2906026 And I'm gonna marry<br />Donald Trump!
2906093 2910163 Walsh, what's going on?<br />Why'd everybody tear out of here?
2910230 2913934 Come on, Pamela. Look at your watch!<br />It's coming up on shift change.
2914001 2916236 The bean counters<br />are worried about overtime,
2916303 2919006 so we sent everybody back<br />to the precinct to punch out.
2919072 2922776 - The next shift is gonna be here in a minute.<br />- You are so full of shit, Walsh.
2922843 2925145 Thank you.
2932185 2934354 What the hell?
2943563 2946199 Hey!
2946266 2949436 Detective.<br />Bob Thompson.
2949502 2951972 City Engineer's Office.
2952039 2954908 We'd like to get<br />an idea of the damage.
2956676 2959847 Man, you guys<br />really got here fast.
2960981 2964584 Well, it's Wall Street, sir.
2964651 2967220 A lot of money here.
2967287 2971391 A lot of opinion makers<br />the mayor doesn't wanna piss off, you know?
2973560 2975963 Is this it?
2977898 2980934 Holy Toledo!
2981001 2983670 Somebody had fun.
2983736 2988275 I'd appreciate it<br />if you'd show my associates the way down.
2990010 2992980 Yeah. Yeah, sure.<br />Jimmy!
2993046 2996816 You got the flashlight?<br />Murphy, come on! You too!
2996884 2999519 - Rick Walsh.<br />- John Gunther.
2999586 3001889 Come on, gentlemen.<br />Let's go.
3004858 3008295 You were probably at the World Trades.<br />You know what that mess was.
3041028 3044731 Please inform Mr. Little<br />that Mr. Vanderfloog is here.
3044797 3048401 Mr. Vanderfloog?
3048468 3051304 There's a Mr. Vanderfloog<br />for Mr. Little.
3069589 3072525 - A lot of steam down here.<br />- Yeah, yeah. We snapped a couple of the steam pipes.
3072592 3074962 It's like a sauna.
3075028 3077364 - We got the subway guys to shut down the third rail.<br />- Emergency lighting.
3077430 3080100 Yeah, emergency lights, and there's<br />still some light... Hey!
3080167 3081868 No shooting!
3081935 3084037 Speak English!
3084104 3086606 Otto doesn't speak English.<br />Do you, Otto?
3086673 3091111 - Where the hell did we get this guy?<br />- He's one of Targo's thugs.
3091178 3093046 Pull all the way up!
3093113 3095248 Pull all the way!<br />Pull all the way!
3101854 3104891 So what's up with this L.A. thing?<br />You famous or something?
3104958 3107227 Yeah, for about five minutes.
3107294 3110097 - Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?<br />- Fuck you.
3110163 3112599 - You know this guy Simon we were talking to?<br />- Yeah.
3112665 3116469 I threw his little brother off the 32nd floor<br />of the Nakatomi Towers out in L.A.
3116536 3119372 - I guess he's a little pissed off about it.<br />- Wait a minute.
3119439 3122175 You mean to tell me I'm in this shit<br />because some white cop...
3122242 3124411 threw some white asshole's<br />brother off a roof?
3169889 3172559 Mr. Vanderfloog?<br />Felix Little, Corporate Relations.
3172625 3175995 Sorry you had to wait, but apparently<br />there was an explosion in the subway.
3176063 3179266 - It's played hell with our alarms, I'm afraid.<br />- I trust there's nothing wrong.
3179332 3182269 Oh, no. Good Lord, no.<br />Safe and secure.
3182335 3185305 Now, you were concerned<br />about a currency exchange?
3185372 3188475 We are not a commercial bank,<br />in the normal sense.
3188541 3191378 We're...<br />We're primarily...
3191444 3194114 governments, central banks,<br />that sort of thing.
3194181 3197717 - Apart from the depository, of course.<br />- Of course.
3197784 3200487 And you are in the flower business,<br />Mr. Vanderfloog?
3204257 3206493 Back! Back! Come on!
3229849 3232252 Come on!
3246433 3249269 Oh, no, Mr. Vanderfloog,<br />that's the vault elevator.
3250803 3254407 I'm sorry. Our alarms are<br />sonic and seismic.
3254474 3256943 Two things which, I'm afraid,<br />do not react well to explosions.
3257009 3260947 You know, this subway business<br />has knocked all our systems into a cocked hat.
3261013 3264184 In fact, we've had to give up<br />and pull the plug on the whole thing.
3264251 3266186 The repair people<br />are downstairs now.
3266253 3268255 - Good Lord!<br />- Yes, yes.
3268321 3271424 Heavens to Betsy<br />if anyone knew!
3273993 3278265 But I thought this was<br />a currency exchange.
3278331 3281734 Oh, I think we'll go<br />straight to the withdrawal.
3285037 3287707 Danke.
3329916 3332685 Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here<br />and take a look at this?
3332752 3335021 Something's going on.
3335087 3338225 - What do you think, guys? You'll be able to fix that?<br />- Just a minute now.
3342729 3345232 Okay, I'll be right back.<br />Down!
3349936 3352205 Stay back!
3352272 3355242 Stay back!
3387540 3389942 Come on. Come on!<br />Shit!
3398818 3401854 - Come on!<br />- Front desk.
3401921 3404156 Call the police. Get your ass down here<br />right now! I'm under attack!
3404223 3408695 - Just relax, mate. Maybe you'll live through this.<br />- Shit!
3432084 3434854 I think he's dead, my dear.
3436589 3439025 All right, let's see to<br />the office work.
3483102 3486373 $140 billion!
3487707 3490643 Ten times what's in Kentucky!
3490710 3494581 Fort Knox is for tourists!
3508227 3510597 Yeah? McClane.
3510663 3513933 John, you're out of shape.<br />You barely made it.
3514000 3517737 Yeah, well, we all barely make it.<br />What do you want us to do?
3517804 3520607 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3520673 3523175 What...
3523242 3526546 - What'd he say?<br />- What has four legs and is always ready to travel?
3526613 3530082 What's the matter with you? Don't you have kids?<br />That's an elephant joke.
3538458 3540727 That a bomb?
3540793 3543496 - Yeah. Go... Go ahead and grab it.<br />- No, you're the cop.
3543563 3546298 - Man, Simon said you're supposed to be helpin' with this.<br />- I'm helpin'.
3546365 3549669 - Well, when are you gonna start helpin'?<br />- After you get the bomb.
3567253 3570089 - Careful.<br />- I'm being careful.
3570156 3574561 - Don't open it.<br />- What? I gotta open it. It's gonna be all right.
3587006 3590677 Shit! Shit!<br />I told you not to open it!
3595482 3597717 I trust you see the message.
3597784 3600352 It has a proximity circuit,<br />so, please, don't run.
3600419 3602489 Yeah, I got it.<br />We're not gonna run.
3602555 3606726 - How do we turn this thing off?<br />- On the fountain, there should be two jugs.
3606793 3610463 Do you see them?<br />A five-gallon and a three-gallon.
3610530 3614801 Fill one of the jugs<br />with exactly four gallons of water.
3614867 3619205 Place it on the scale, and the timer will stop.<br />You must be precise.
3619271 3623009 One ounce or more less<br />will result in detonation.
3623075 3625712 - If you're still alive in five minutes, we'll speak.<br />- Wait! Wait a sec...
3630583 3633920 - I don't get it. You get it?<br />- No.
3634954 3638224 Get the jugs.
3638290 3641093 Obviously, we can't fill the three-gallon<br />jug with four gallons, right?
3641160 3644396 - Obviously.<br />- All right, I know. Here we go.
3644463 3647867 We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?
3647934 3650469 We pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug,
3650537 3653372 giving us exactly three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug, right?
3653439 3655542 Right. Then what?
3655608 3658845 - Now, take the three-gallon jug, fill that a third...<br />- No, no. He said be precise.
3658911 3661247 - Shit!<br />- Exactly four gallons.
3661313 3664483 Every cop in 50 miles is runnin' his ass off,<br />and I'm playin' kids' games in a park.
3664551 3668621 Hey! You want to focus<br />on the problem at hand?
3684671 3688307 I thought you said you knew!<br />You said don't say anything if you don't know.
3688374 3690877 - Gimme the fuckin' jug. We're startin' over. Pour that out.<br />- We can't start over.
3690943 3692679 - We can't start over. We can't start over.<br />- We're starting over.
3692745 3695347 Gimme the jug or I'm gonna put<br />my foot up your ass, you dumb mother...
3695414 3699018 - Say it! You were gonna call me a nigger, weren't you?<br />- No, I wasn't!
3699085 3702421 - Yes, you were. What were you gonna call me?<br />- Asshole! How's that?
3702488 3706826 Asshole! You got some fuckin' problem with me<br />'cause I'm white, Zeus? Is that it?
3706893 3709829 Have I oppressed you?<br />Have I oppressed your people somehow?
3709896 3713099 - You don't like me 'cause you're a racist!<br />- What?
3713165 3715134 You don't like me 'cause I'm white.
3715201 3718871 I don't like you because you're gonna<br />get me killed. How much time?
3718938 3722308 Aw, shit! We got less than a minute.<br />Throw this thing away.
3722374 3726012 We can't take it off of there. It'll detonate.<br />Wait a second. Wait a second.
3728147 3730883 - I got it! Exactly two gallons in here, right?<br />- Right.
3730950 3733620 - Leaving exactly one gallon of empty space, right?<br />- Yeah.
3733686 3737624 A full five gallons here. Pour one gallon<br />out of the five gallons into there, we have...
3737690 3739859 - Exactly four gallons!<br />- Yes!
3739926 3742294 Pour it in there. Come on.<br />Come on!
3743562 3745431 Don't spill it. Don't spill it!
3745497 3749035 - Good, good, good. Exactly four gallons.<br />- You did it, McClane.
3749101 3751537 - Put it on the thing! Get it down there!<br />- Oh, shit!
3759511 3762314 Congratulations.<br />You're still alive.
3762381 3765017 Congratulations.
3765084 3768655 - Yeah, we did it.<br />- You surprise me again, John.
3768721 3770556 This is becoming<br />an ugly habit.
3770623 3773559 Yeah, well, I don't have the time<br />right now, Simon. Listen.
3773626 3776428 Deal's a deal.<br />Where's the school bomb?
3776495 3779531 On the contrary,<br />you have lots of time.
3779598 3781934 You have...
3782001 3785104 two hours and 47 minutes precisely.
3785171 3788641 - Plenty of time to test those wits of yours.<br />- Hey! Hey!
3788708 3792812 Hey, listen, jerk-off! Let me tell you somethin'.<br />I got a bad fuckin' hangover!
3792879 3796148 And I'm a little sick of these fuckin' riddles!<br />Now, where is the school bomb?
3796215 3800319 Temper, John.<br />The road to truth has many turns.
3800386 3803790 You will find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3803856 3808227 When you undertake the trip it suggests,<br />ask yourself this question...
3808294 3811964 What is 21 out of 42?
3814066 3817136 We're behind.<br />We should abandon the rest and go.
3817203 3819906 Relax, Targo.<br />There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3819972 3824476 He's sending us to the home team<br />dugout at Yankee Stadium. Why?
3824543 3827346 Well, we're the home team.<br />Are we supposed to find something there?
3827413 3832484 - What's 21 out of 42?<br />- Twenty-one again. Half of 42. Forty-two what?
3832551 3835722 - How many players are on the Yankees ball club?<br />- Twenty-five.
3835788 3839191 - What else is 21? Blackjack.<br />- It's a club.
3839258 3842061 It's a wild-goose chase<br />is what it is.
3845965 3848367 Where's the nearest A train?
3848434 3852138 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br />You know, some kid might find that.
3854240 3856709 You're right.
3860379 3864316 Come back here!<br />You little sons of bitches!
3864383 3866886 Hey, you!<br />I remember you!
3868587 3871090 Hey, hey, where are you going?<br />Come here. What are ya doin'?
3871157 3873559 - Let me go, dick-head.<br />- Watch your mouth.
3873625 3877730 You wanna go down to juvenile hall<br />for a Butterfinger, is that it?
3877797 3880366 Look around, man.<br />All the cops are into somethin'.
3880432 3882701 It's Christmas.<br />You could steal city hall!
3889942 3892578 - Come on! Let's go. Come on!<br />- My bike!
3892644 3894814 - That's my bike!<br />- Yeah, it's Christmas!
3894881 3898450 - Hey, hey, where are ya going? Yankee Stadium's that way.<br />- That's my bike, you asshole!
3905124 3907960 Why don't ya just run over everybody<br />in the whole street?
3908027 3910729 McClane, what the fuck<br />are we doing back down here?
3910797 3913599 Let me ask you somethin'.<br />What is it that Wall Street doesn't have?
3913665 3915968 What, is this stuff catchin'?<br />You're talkin' in riddles.
3916035 3920039 No, no, stay with me! What is it<br />that Wall Street does not have? Schools.
3920106 3923876 - And what is it they have a shitload of?<br />- What?
3930416 3932584 I'll be back in a minute.
3932651 3935421 What am I supposed to do with this?
3935487 3938157 Give it to those guys over there.
3938224 3941493 - He's here.<br />- Perhaps you could be a little more specific.
3941560 3946198 McClane is here.<br />He's walking toward the bank.
3946265 3949568 And the black man<br />is coming toward me.
3949635 3955241 Oh, no, that's a pity. And after we've gone<br />to all that trouble at the stadium.
3955307 3957309 Simon, kill him.
3957376 3961247 Stop toying with him<br />and kill him now.
3961313 3963349 Okay, so be it.
3963415 3968520 May he rest in peace.<br />I'll inform Karl in the lobby.
3968587 3971523 - You pack up your team and get out of there.<br />- And this one?
3971590 3973259 Officer.
3976595 3979398 Yeah, I'm afraid<br />I'm gonna need an answer on that issue.
3984837 3988440 - Let him go.<br />- Understood. Yes, sir?
3988507 3992311 John McClane says<br />to give you this.
3992378 3995381 Wait, wait! Jesus!<br />Don't open it. It's a bomb.
3995447 3997116 - Another?<br />- Yeah?
3997183 4000819 I see. We'll take care of that.<br />We better move now.
4000887 4006292 Sir, thank you so much for your assistance.<br />We really appreciate it. Thank you.
4025444 4028747 Hey! You...<br />You leavin' this place unguarded?
4049902 4052471 - How ya doin'?<br />- All right.
4052538 4055041 John McClane, N.Y.P.D.
4055107 4057176 Are ya all right?
4057243 4060012 Yeah. It's laundry day.
4061113 4063382 What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
4063449 4065884 Has it been quiet like this<br />all morning here?
4065952 4069488 - Well...<br />- Except for that big explosion a couple of hours ago.
4069555 4073559 - Have you seen anything strange happen in the last hour or so?<br />- No.
4073625 4077863 - We've had cops in here pretty steady since the subway thing.<br />- Yeah, right.
4077930 4081600 We were just gonna make a round<br />on the vault floor if you wanna tag along.
4081667 4083835 Sure, yeah. I think I will.
4083902 4087839 - What do you think of this heat this late in the year?<br />- Indian summer, huh?
4087906 4092878 Yeah, it feels like it's gonna rain like dogs<br />and cats later. Here's one of your guys.
4092945 4095814 Detective Otto, isn't it?
4095881 4097984 John McClane.
4100186 4102254 Mike, how ya doin'?
4104690 4108560 I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna take<br />the stairs just for the exercise.
4108627 4113532 And on a hot day like this...<br />But it seems like I always end up riding the lift.
4140426 4143429 Hey, what was the lottery<br />number last night?
4143495 4146098 You guys play the lottery?<br />No?
4146165 4148834 My wife buys me<br />two tickets every week.
4148900 4151403 For the last 10 years,<br />plays the same two numbers all the time.
4151470 4154006 I said, Honey, why don't you play<br />a different number?
4154073 4157443 She says, well, those are my lucky numbers.<br />I got the tickets right here.
4160679 4164916 Put that fuckin' gun down!<br />Put the fuckin' gun down now!
4169121 4172658 Put it down!
4177929 4180099 Hello?
4180166 4182368 Anybody down here?
4191643 4194813 Put your hands up!<br />Put your fuckin' hands up now!
4194880 4197483 No, John!<br />No, no, God, it's me!
4199651 4202621 - Jesus Christ, you almost gave me a heart attack.<br />- You all right?
4202688 4204490 You all right?
4204556 4207059 - Yeah, yeah, it's not my blood.<br />- What the hell's goin' on down here?
4207126 4210096 Go take a look in there.
4231783 4235387 Hey, McClane.<br />Where the hell is everybody?
4235454 4238957 Simon fuckin' says!
4239024 4242361 I should've seen it comin' a mile away.<br />This was never about revenge.
4242428 4245697 - It's about a goddamn heist.<br />- What was in the room?
4245764 4247499 This.
4247566 4251137 What is this? Oh, shit!<br />Is this gold?
4251203 4254840 - Yeah, it's gold.<br />- This is heavy! They cleaned out a whole room of this?
4254906 4259111 - Yeah.<br />- You know, that would've taken like a tank or a...
4259178 4261313 A dump truck.
4261380 4263349 Fourteen great big dump trucks.
4263415 4265684 - We almost got hit by a dump truck.<br />- Shit!
4265751 4268019 Damn! Slow down! Shit!
4268086 4269921 - Put that shit down.<br />- No fuckin' way.
4269988 4272057 - They ain't gonna let you keep it.<br />- Yeah, yeah, we'll see.
4272124 4274160 - We're gonna need a car.<br />- A car?
4280132 4282501 - You know how to hot-wire this thing?<br />- Of course I can.
4282568 4286205 I'm an electrician. Only problem is...
4289708 4291577 Takes too fuckin' long.
4303989 4308394 - They're not on the bridge.<br />- Down there, McClane. The F.D.R.
4310996 4313465 Let's go, let's go! Come on!
4313532 4315367 Aw, shit!
4315434 4318270 - What?<br />- They shot the phone.
4318337 4321139 Aw, too bad. Come on.<br />What's 21 out of 42?
4321207 4323742 - I don't have a clue.<br />- What about Yankee Stadium?
4323809 4326878 We'll get there. But that son of a bitch<br />is not gettin' off on Manhattan!
4326945 4330682 Jesus Christ! Who do you think<br />you are, lady, Hillary Clinton?
4330749 4333452 That's it! Hillary Clinton!<br />The 42nd president.
4333519 4337623 - She'd be the 43rd president.<br />- All right. Who's the 21st?
4337689 4339658 - I don't know.<br />- You don't know?
4339725 4342060 - No, I don't know. Do you know?<br />- No!
4342127 4345664 Well? What kinda engine does this piece<br />of shit have? Step on it!
4345731 4348767 It's a Yugo.<br />It's built for economy, not speed.
4350702 4353839 - What are ya doin'?<br />- I'm gonna get us another phone.
4357643 4360946 Wait, wait, wait.<br />Hey! Who was the 21st president?
4361012 4362914 Go fuck yourself!
4364983 4368920 - That guy was pissed.<br />- He'll feel better when he looks in the backseat.
4368987 4373759 - Oh, shit, that was my gold bar!<br />- This is McClane. Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.
4373825 4376462 - John, where the hell are you?<br />- Walter, it's not a revenge. It's a heist.
4376528 4379130 - What?<br />- There's gold in the Federal Reserve,
4379197 4381533 and they took a shitload of it.
4381600 4384102 - They're headed north in dump trucks.<br />- Have you been drinking?
4384169 4386738 No, not since this morning.
4386805 4389441 Listen, there's a line of dump trucks<br />northbound on the F.D.R. at about 70th.
4389508 4392311 You gotta close the bridge<br />and get some helicopters over there right away.
4392378 4394913 I couldn't close<br />a hot dog stand right now.
4394980 4398049 I'm spread all over hell.<br />What about this damn bomb?
4398116 4400286 Find out who the 21st president was.<br />It's got something to do with this.
4400352 4402220 John! John, the 21st what?
4402288 4406358 Walter? Shit!<br />Goddamn cellular fuckin' phones!
4406425 4408260 - Get hold of Munson in Triborough.<br />- Inspector.
4408327 4411397 Tell him to close all the East River<br />bridges north of 59th street.
4411463 4413765 - Lookin' for dump trucks.<br />- Dump trucks?
4413832 4417636 McClane says there are dump trucks<br />headed up the F.D.R. loaded with gold.
4417703 4420772 Walter, they don't allow<br />dump trucks on the F.D.R.!
4420839 4423309 - Connie!<br />- All right! You don't want I should argue,
4423375 4425811 I won't argue,<br />no matter how stupid it is.
4425877 4429214 K-9, bring it around to the back.<br />Check out the boiler room.
4429281 4431182 Find anything, Charlie?
4431249 4434620 I could spend a week in here<br />with an X-ray machine and still not find it.
4434686 4438189 You don't have a week. You got five more minutes,<br />then we're movin' up to 86th street.
4438256 4440158 We're goin' as fast as we can.
4440225 4442160 What's up?
4442227 4445263 McClane was mentioning something<br />about the Federal Reserve Building.
4445331 4448934 - Isn't that right near that Wall Street bomb site we just left?<br />- Yeah.
4454105 4457509 How long do you want us<br />to stay here?
4457576 4460111 The men at the stadium,<br />stay or go?
4460178 4462881 Karl should have<br />checked in by now.
4462948 4464850 Moment.
4470922 4475461 Come on, come on.
4475527 4478597 Stay where you are.<br />McClane may still turn up.
4478664 4481467 Relax, Targo.<br />If he is still alive,
4481533 4485371 he won't be talking to anyone.
4485437 4487539 It's the next turnoff.
4487606 4491209 Hi, it's Elvis Duran.<br />You're on the air. What's up?
4491276 4494480 First of all, I just wanna tell you<br />what a great show you got.
4494546 4497483 - I listen to you all the time.<br />- Thank you. What do you wanna talk about?
4497549 4501587 You know all those cop cars screaming around<br />everywhere? You know what they're up to?
4501653 4506091 There's a bomb in a school.<br />My cousin's a cop.
4506157 4509027 - Here you go, my dear.<br />- Somebody put a big bomb in a school somewhere.
4509094 4511029 Only they don't know which one.
4511096 4513765 So they're searching all of them.
4513832 4516768 Every school in<br />the metropolitan area.
4516835 4519004 Holy shit!
4519070 4522207 - Doris, can you get a hold of my wife?<br />- Annie?
4522273 4527413 Turley! Half the goddamn city<br />just called 911!
4529114 4531082 They're gone.
4531149 4533018 - What?<br />- They're gone!
4533084 4536488 - Who is this guy? Houdini?<br />- Shit! Down there! Down there!
4538457 4542060 - This thing got air bags?<br />- Your side does. I don't know about my...
4542127 4544830 McClane!
4565316 4568253 In the truck,<br />let me see the hands.
4568319 4570856 Put 'em on the door!
4573925 4576528 Don't kill me!<br />Don't shoot me!
4578464 4582501 - You a truck driver?<br />- No, I'm a beautician. Of course I'm a truck driver!
4582568 4584536 Where you takin' this truck?
4584603 4589207 - The aqueduct.<br />- What are ya takin' a dump truck to the racetrack for?
4589274 4593745 - No, the aqueduct. The aque... The water aqueduct!<br />- Aqueduct?
4596181 4600719 See? It goes from here all the way<br />out to the Catskill Mountains.
4600786 4605491 - What does?<br />- That! The water pipe! Goes for about 60 miles!
4611530 4613665 - Hey, you the foreman?<br />- Yeah.
4613732 4618169 N.Y.P.D. You had any extra dump trucks<br />come through here in the last couple of minutes?
4618236 4620438 I'm gonna write<br />those fuckin' clowns up.
4620506 4622908 They better start payin' attention to work orders,<br />or I'm gonna kick some butt.
4622974 4627112 - Who you talkin' about?<br />- The dozen idiots who tore ass up the tube!
4627178 4629280 We're not loadin' up there.<br />We're loadin' over here!
4629347 4631617 So much for bridges<br />and helicopters.
4631683 4635721 - You got a map showin' me where this tunnel goes?<br />- Yeah, right here.
4637723 4641326 We run pretty much up under the Saw Mill<br />until you get up to the Coffer Dam.
4641392 4644195 From there on, we've already brought<br />the water down from the reservoir.
4644262 4648534 - Anybody get in or outta there?<br />- Yeah. There's a vent shaft every two miles.
4648600 4652337 - No, I mean with a truck?<br />- At the Coffer Dam. You can get a truck in there.
4652403 4656141 You can get there on the surface.<br />Follow Saw Mill River Parkway. It's about 20 miles.
4656207 4659845 - I'm gonna meet you right there, all right?<br />- What am I supposed to do?
4659911 4663048 - You're gonna go up to Yankee Stadium.<br />- McClane.
4663114 4666752 - Go! Get outta here! We got less than two hours.<br />- Goddamn it!
4671857 4674259 Hey! Is somethin' wrong?
4674325 4679264 480 yards of rock moved so far.<br />Now, that's 10 times the Hoover Dam.
4679330 4683802 Right now, there's 516 feet<br />of rock above our heads.
4683869 4686638 This part is phase three<br />of tunnel three.
4686705 4689608 Planning for it<br />began back in 1954,
4689675 4692377 but construction didn't begin<br />till June of 1970.
4692443 4695213 You know what the most interesting part<br />of tunnel three is?
4695280 4697583 - What's that, Jerry?<br />- The valves. Each one...
4704289 4708059 A big departure<br />from tunnels one and two.
4708126 4712631 Come on! What a hell<br />of a place to break down.
4712698 4714933 Hold it a minute, Jerry.<br />Let me have your hard hat.
4715000 4717603 - You got a jacket?<br />- Yeah, yeah, yeah, here.
4717669 4719805 Wait here a minute.
4719871 4723141 Wait until he gets<br />alongside the door.
4723208 4726812 Hey, fellas. Mickey O'Brien,<br />aqueduct security.
4726878 4730015 Hey, listen, we got a report of a guy<br />comin' through here with eight reindeer...
4737555 4742594 Yeah, they said he was a jolly, old, fat guy<br />with a snowy white beard.
4742661 4746632 Cute little red-and-white suit.<br />I'm surprised you didn't see him.
4749034 4752437 What is it with you guys<br />and these phones?
4752503 4755006 This'll gimme somethin'.
4755073 4758343 Holy shit!<br />Is that guy dead?
4758409 4761947 - Yes, Jerry. I'm afraid he is.<br />- Jesus Christ!
4762013 4765917 Yeah. I want you to get<br />ahold of a guy named Cobb.
4765984 4769655 Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.<br />He's the head of my police unit.
4769721 4773491 Get him down here. Find him.<br />Tell him you were with John McClane.
4773558 4777395 - Tell him to find out who the 21st president was.<br />- Chester A. Arthur.
4777462 4780098 - What?<br />- Chester A. Arthur.
4780165 4784269 1881 to 1885.<br />Nominated Vice President in 1880.
4784335 4787739 Did you know he was collector of customs<br />right here in New York?
4787806 4791777 No, I didn't know that, Jerry.<br />Take care of yourself.
4855273 4858209 TV's got us. TV's got us.<br />We gotta release these traffic guys.
4858276 4860545 No, traffic jams<br />we can take care of later.
4860611 4863281 - You find out what the hell is wrong with this thing!<br />- The frequencies are jammed.
4863348 4865550 - What about Ricky?<br />- I don't know. I can't get ahold of him.
4865616 4868053 - But, Walter, Federal Reserve.<br />- Yeah?
4868119 4871489 Biggest gold storage in the world.
4871556 4875226 You get a unit back down there.<br />Find Ricky. Find out what the hell is goin' on.
4875293 4878764 - Walter! You gotta hear this.<br />- Yeah?
4883101 4886872 - Christ, I thought we were going in the back way!<br />- This is the back way, Walter.
4886938 4891309 In half an hour, you're gonna have a riot<br />at every school in this city.
4896581 4900151 We'll start at the top floor.<br />Put 20 men on each floor.
4900218 4902620 Send the other 50 men<br />down to the basement with us.
4902687 4905656 - What about McClane?<br />- Not a word. I'm getting nothing but busy signals.
4905723 4907625 Westchester's probably<br />worse than we are.
4907692 4910228 This is kinda puttin' all our eggs in one basket.<br />What if McClane's wrong?
4910295 4912130 - Walter.<br />- Yeah?
4912197 4914599 This is Principal Martinez.<br />Principal Martinez, Inspector Cobb.
4914665 4917035 - How do you do, Inspector?<br />- How do you do, Principal Martinez?
4917102 4919270 I don't want to alarm<br />your children.
4919337 4921472 I wonder if you could move them<br />all into the auditorium and keep them calm.
4939524 4943361 We are coming to the dam.<br />You can call the rear guard.
4948733 4952637 Rear guard,<br />you can close up now.
4952703 4957608 We've reached the dam.<br />You can come up now. Nils?
4957675 4961679 You can close in now!<br />Nils!
4961746 4964215 Attention! Attention!<br />Nils is dead.
4964282 4968119 I repeat, Nils is dead, fuck-head.<br />So's his pal.
4968186 4972090 And those four guys from the East German All-Stars,<br />your boys down at the bank,
4972157 4974659 they're gonna be a little late.
4974725 4977062 John.
4977128 4982533 In the back of the truck you're driving,<br />there's $13 billion worth in gold bullion.
4982600 4986137 - I wonder, would a deal be out of the question?<br />- Yeah, I got a deal for you.
4986204 4989908 Crawl out from under that rock you're hiding<br />under and I'll drive this truck up your ass.
4989975 4992477 How colorful.
4998950 5003154 - I told you not to toy with him!<br />- Thank you. That's very helpful.
5006457 5009494 You've jeopardized the mission<br />and the contract!
5011829 5016434 We are vulnerable till we reach the ship.<br />I'm going to put an end to this.
5017903 5020171 Stop!
5022340 5024642 Targo! Targo!
5024709 5026878 Here! Come here!

5029614 5031549 We drown him.
5042527 5044896 Walter!

5049935 5053004 - Not hooked up.<br />- Yeah?
5053071 5055606 Okay. Now, take a look<br />at the front.
5057342 5060345 We drill the hinges.<br />Get everybody out.

5215166 5217168 - McClane!<br />- Where are ya?
5217235 5222006 Over here! You got a hell of a way of flaggin'<br />somebody down! You all right?
5222073 5224942 - Did you go to Yankee Stadium?<br />- Yeah. There's nobody there.
5225009 5227112 - You didn't see nobody?<br />- No!
5227178 5230781 - Nobody was followin' you?<br />- I'm tellin' ya, he's jerkin' us around!
5230848 5233751 - Oh, shit! Jesus!<br />- Come on, come on, come on!
5233818 5237655 - Oh, no, I didn't see nobody. Nobody's following us.<br />- Go, go, go!
5242127 5245096 It's not rigged. Pull it.
5255873 5259710 Well, I'd say<br />you could call off your search.
5259777 5262613 - Can you stop it?<br />- I shouldn't even touch it.
5262680 5266784 Who knows what kind of booby traps<br />this thing's got. What about the code?
5266851 5269354 - No word.<br />- When do we evacuate?
5269420 5272723 - Simon says he sees one kid leave the building, boom!<br />- Fine, there's a chance...
5272790 5276261 that somebody's watchin',<br />but we can't stand here with our thumb up our ass...

5344229 5348866 Hi, kids. I know you usually have<br />assembly on Fridays, but today is special.
5348933 5352036 Mr. Lambert here is<br />from the fire department...
5352102 5356674 and today he wants us to<br />practice a brand-new fire drill.
5356741 5360177 So, I want you to divide in half,<br />and I want half of you to go over here...
5360245 5363514 teachers will help them...<br />and line up against the wall.
5363581 5368653 The other half will go in this direction.<br />Please do it very quietly and very quickly.
5368719 5371822 All right? Everybody up, please.<br />Teachers, please help them.
5371889 5375360 Fire drill, my ass!<br />That guy ain't from the fire department.
5375426 5380365 - Maybe it's 'cause of the radio.<br />- You mean like they're after us? Nah.
5380431 5383668 - Tony squealed on us.<br />- No, he didn't.
5383734 5387338 - Come on!<br />- Well, where you going?
5389907 5394044 Let me drive! Let me drive!<br />Goddamn it!
5394111 5397081 Why the hell<br />didn't you tell me before?
5397147 5399984 - Of course he put the bomb up in that school.<br />- Why would he do that?
5400050 5404555 Make sure he got<br />your complete attention!
5406257 5408225 - Jesus! Jesus!<br />- Find the fuse panel!
5408293 5410895 - What?<br />- The fuse panel! Where's the fuse panel to this car?
5410961 5413398 - It's right here! Right here!<br />- Pull out the anti-lock brakes fuse.
5413464 5416834 - Shit, I don't know which one it is.<br />- Well, then yank 'em all out.
5416901 5420671 - There.<br />- Put your head fuckin' down. This is gonna be really bad.
5420738 5424442 Listen to me.<br />Hang the fuck on, all right?
5450668 5453237 Oh, what the fuck happened?
5453304 5455806 You got a Triple A card?
5455873 5458175 - Keep moving. Keep moving.<br />- Excuse me.
5458242 5460545 I got the janitors making a last<br />sweep of the building right now.
5460611 5462680 Thank you, Ms. Martinez.
5480030 5481932 Come on.
5485403 5487772 Stay down! Stay low!
5497081 5498916 Oh, man!
5501652 5503854 - What the fuck are you doin'?<br />- Interrogatin' him.
5503921 5506123 What's he gonna tell you,<br />I'm dead?
5506190 5508025 I ain't gonna know<br />till I ask him.
5508092 5511095 Go around and see if there's<br />any aspirins in that glove box.
5511161 5513364 No way. You do it.
5519937 5524409 Ten quarters.<br />The guy in the dump truck had 10 quarters.
5524475 5528145 - Exactly ten quarters.<br />- Well, maybe they were making long-distance phone calls.
5528212 5530815 No. It's for the bridge.
5530881 5533083 - What?<br />- It's for the toll on the bridge.
5535386 5537622 There, there!<br />Down on the wharf!
5537688 5540658 Dump trucks!<br />Right there! Right there!
5540725 5544795 Christ, they got it loaded<br />on a ship already.
5546497 5548766 Shit!<br />How 'bout the Coast Guard?
5548833 5550935 - It'd take 'em an hour to get here.<br />- Shit!
5551001 5553070 Shit!
5553137 5555172 - We can jump.<br />- What?
5555239 5558108 - We can jump.<br />- Outta your fuckin' mind? It's 100 feet down to the deck!
5558175 5562346 - But not to the crane it isn't.<br />- The cables would cut you in half.
5562413 5564314 - I can make it.<br />- Bullshit. Get down.
5564381 5567585 Get down. Look in the back of<br />that car for some gloves.
5570387 5573658 Six booby traps, four dead ends...
5573724 5576794 <i>And a partridge in a pear tree</i>
5581098 5585135 Okay, honey, let's dance.
5585202 5589273 We're gonna have sort of a race.<br />So when I say go, I want you all to run like crazy.
5589339 5593444 All of you follow the police officer and the fireman.<br />You guys are my front runners.
5593511 5595880 Walter, I think we're cuttin'<br />this a little thin.
5595946 5599383 No, Joe, we're gonna wait.<br />McClane still may get the code.
5601786 5604922 - Line me up with that crane!<br />- There, there, right there.
5604989 5608292 - Right there. You're okay.<br />- All right, I see it now.
5608358 5612096 - Shit, this is gonna take a miracle. Swing it.<br />- Keep your fingers crossed.
5612162 5614331 Okay, come on, come on.<br />You almost got it.
5614398 5616601 Almost, almost.<br />Yeah, all right!
5616667 5618803 Where you goin'?<br />You in a hurry?
5618869 5620905 I'm goin' first this time, all right?
5622673 5625309 We have the intercom rigged, sir.
5625375 5629480 Walter, the kids may be fine, but you wait<br />much longer, and I'm gonna pee in my pants.
5629547 5632583 We're gonna wait, Connie.
5632650 5634752 Six more minutes.
5649066 5651068 - Yo, McClane. Down there.<br />- What?
5661612 5664682 Oh, shit! Go, go. Go, man!<br />Go, go, go!

5765549 5767584 We go find Simon...
5767652 5770721 and drag him to the ship-to-shore radio<br />and beat that fuckin' code out of him.
5770788 5772757 Here, take this.
5772823 5775159 - How does it work?<br />- You don't know how to shoot a gun?
5775225 5777728 Look, all brothers don't know how to shoot guns,<br />you racist motherfucker.
5777795 5781498 Sue me. Just yank back on that<br />and pull the trigger.
5781565 5783567 - That's it.<br />- That's it?
5783634 5785469 That's it.<br />Just don't shoot yourself.
5785535 5788806 Hey, don't be no hero.<br />You find him, you come get me.
5805422 5807825 Hey, Katya!
5815866 5818368 Stupid. Stupid!
5859109 5861345 You have the autopilot set?
5861411 5863881 - Yes, sir.<br />- Good.
5869219 5871155 Don't fuckin' move.
5877527 5879663 Oh, the Samaritan.
5879730 5884401 - Gimme the goddamn code.<br />- Code?
5884468 5888005 You mean for the school?<br />I'm sorry, I can't do that.
5888072 5891876 You call in that code right now<br />or I blow your sick ass...
5891942 5894711 into the next world.
5894779 5896847 If that's what you gotta do.
5908092 5910995 You gotta take<br />the safety catch off.
5911061 5913530 Oh, goddamn!
5913597 5916867 - See, that works. Now, where's McClane?<br />- Shit!
5934251 5936086 What was that?
5939890 5941992 He said, don't shoot.
5942059 5946363 Charlie, we're gonna have to go<br />with the evacuation.
5946430 5949133 - We're gonna go!<br />- You heard the man. Let's go! Let's go!

5986203 5989539 What are they doin'?<br />Yo, where you goin'?
5989606 5992676 - Hey, where you goin'?<br />- What's goin' on?
5992742 5996313 I see you all day, little man.<br />Policeman.
5996380 6000250 And you don't go away.
6000317 6002887 Yeah, I'm that fuckin'<br />Energizer bunny.
6005789 6008425 Where are you going now, huh?
6010127 6013463 Going to arrest me, bunny?
6013530 6017567 No. I don't think<br />I'm gonna arrest you.
6018735 6021038 I'm gonna fuckin' kill you.
6031381 6035152 - I knew it was bullshit. There's nobody watching.<br />- Time to get Charlie out.
6035219 6037621 Let's move, Charles.<br />Time's up.
6037687 6040958 - Give me another 30 seconds.<br />- It takes a minute-15 if you're a kid, Charlie.
6041025 6044661 And last I looked, you weren't too light<br />on your feet. Now move!
6044728 6046931 - Up here!<br />- Oh, my God!
6049166 6051902 - Christ, get 'em outta there!<br />- The rooms are locked!

6069186 6073523 - I'm stayin'.<br />- No, Charlie, get outta there!

6123207 6126576 - Where are they, Walter?<br />- Still in.
6133217 6135419 No guts, no glory.
6138122 6141491 If we get to the roof, we can<br />jump to the next building!
6141558 6144061 - Shit!<br />- Outta the way.
6144128 6146096 Okay, come on.
6148265 6150500 Come on. Get him up here!<br />Come on, come on!
6150567 6154304 Mayday. Mayday. Bridgeport Coast Guard.<br />Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.
6167917 6170287 Come on, kids.
6173890 6178062 - Shit, it's too far!<br />- Over here. Down.
6183200 6185502 No guts, no glory.
6185569 6188305 There's a big black-and-white<br />fuckin' boat in the middle of the harbor.
6188372 6192076 - Stay on the line.<br />- Yeah, sure, I'll stay on the line.
6208192 6210694 Pancake syrup?
6210760 6214498 Stupid. Stupid. Asshole.
6215665 6217767 Hello, John McClane.
6217834 6221405 There was never any bomb<br />in the school, was there?
6221471 6224040 Of course not.
6224108 6229413 I'm a soldier, not a monster.<br />Even though I sometimes work for monsters.
6229479 6233783 No. The real bomb is on this ship.
6237154 6239923 Coast Guard.
6239989 6242292 I was tellin' 'em<br />where the boat was.
6242359 6244828 Game over, huh?
6244894 6247997 Not quite over.
6248064 6251268 Bridgeport Coast Guard,<br />come in, please.
6251335 6256039 - They put you on hold?<br />- She told me to stay on the line.
6258475 6262279 Oh, God, I love this country.
6262346 6265982 You know, your brother<br />was an asshole.
6266049 6269486 - He really was an asshole.<br />- He was... He was an asshole.
6269553 6273089 You got his number, yeah.<br />Yeah, okay.
6275192 6279696 Forgive me.<br />Would you help Mr. McClane below?
6279763 6282432 Careful now.
6283667 6287537 Now, do you have the communiqué?
6287604 6290507 - Bridgeport Radio. Come in, please, Bridgeport.<br />- Coast Guard.
6290574 6292542 - Are you there, dear?<br />- Yes, we're here.
6292609 6295945 - Do you have the ability to record a message?<br />- Yes.
6296012 6299183 - Then please begin now.<br />- All right.
6304053 6307257 This is a communiqué from the C.R.F.
6307324 6311094 For too long, the West has conspired<br />to steal the wealth of the world,
6311161 6314398 consigning the balance of humanity<br />to economic starvation.
6314464 6317701 Today, we will level<br />the playing field.
6317767 6320737 In a few minutes, the contents<br />of the Federal Reserve Bank,
6320804 6324073 the gold your economies<br />are built of,
6324140 6328712 will be redistributed by explosive<br />across the bottom of the Long Island Sound.
6330514 6333883 If you are not in gridlock,<br />I invite you to come and watch.
6338855 6341958 - You're gonna blow it all up?<br />- That's the idea.
6342025 6344494 There are some gentlemen in the Middle East<br />who seem to think...
6344561 6346963 that they'll make<br />a great deal of money.
6347030 6351801 See the men safely off the ship,<br />and I'll see you in the port-side launch.
6351868 6355905 What the hell's all this<br />got to do with killin' McClane?
6355972 6357874 Life has its little bonuses.
6357941 6361010 Didn't I hear you say you<br />didn't even like your brother?
6361077 6363813 There's a difference between not liking<br />one's brother and not caring...
6363880 6366550 when some dumb Irish flatfoot<br />drops him out of a window.
6366616 6368685 Hey, I didn't even know<br />that motherfucker!
6368752 6370854 Yes, and I never invited you<br />aboard the ship.
6370920 6372822 No riddle is gonna stop<br />this motherfucker?
6372889 6376326 No code, no riddle,<br />no fancy little countdown.
6376393 6379596 Hey, fuck-head.<br />Yeah, you, fuck-head.
6381265 6383867 There's just one thing<br />I gotta know.
6383933 6386470 You got any aspirins?
6386536 6389539 I've had a bad fuckin'<br />headache all day long.
6390740 6394244 Must be your lucky day.
6394311 6398282 Keep the bottle.
6409393 6412796 Where is the gold?
6412862 6415899 He's betrayed us.
6415965 6418702 The containers<br />are filled with that.
6451267 6454070 If I hadn't have saved your fuckin' ass,<br />I wouldn't be sittin' here with you...
6454137 6456373 about to blow up with<br />$100 billion in fuckin' gold!
6456440 6458808 Yeah, well, I got some bad news.<br />You're only gonna blow up with me.
6458875 6461177 - What?<br />- There's no gold on this boat.
6461244 6463913 - How do you know that?<br />- 'Cause I know the man, I know the family.
6463980 6466516 The only thing better than blowin' up<br />$100 billion worth of gold...
6466583 6468818 is makin' people think you did.
6468885 6472021 - Well, where is it?<br />- He must've have switched it back on the dock somewhere.
6472088 6475191 - Oh, yeah. That's supposed to make me feel better?<br />- No.
6475258 6477461 You're wrong about the other thing though.<br />You're not gonna die.
6477527 6480430 You know some cop trick about handcuffs<br />that's gonna get us outta this?
6480497 6482899 Yeah, use a key.
6482966 6485935 - You know how to pick this lock?<br />- Is this some black shit again?
6486002 6488972 Will you stop with that racial shit?<br />Are you a fuckin' locksmith or not?
6489038 6492308 - Yeah, yeah, I can do it if I had somethin' to do it with.<br />- How 'bout a splinter...
6492376 6495479 - of that cable I slid down?<br />- That might work.
6495545 6499716 - Hold on.<br />- What the fuck are you doin'?
6502919 6505722 Oh, fuck! Shit!
6505789 6509092 - How's that? That big enough?<br />- Shit, yeah, that might work.
6509158 6512362 All right, then I'm gonna drop it<br />in your hands. Cup your hand.
6512429 6515465 - Don't drop this motherfucker, all right?<br />- Get... All right, come on.
6515532 6517434 - Ya ready? Ready?<br />- One...
6517501 6519503 Two... Spit it.
6519569 6522972 - Yeah! Come on, come on. Move your hands.<br />- Get it?
6523039 6526009 All right, okay.
6526075 6530113 - Damn, McClane, you know, I was just startin' to like you.<br />- Well, don't. I'm an asshole.
6530179 6532181 What are you<br />talkin' about now?
6532248 6535051 - I lied to you, Zeus.<br />- About what?
6535118 6539222 - Remember I said Weiss found that bomb up in Harlem?<br />- Yeah.
6539288 6542726 - They found it in Chinatown.<br />- Now that's low, even for a white motherfucker like you.
6542792 6545462 I told you<br />I was an asshole.
6545529 6547931 What the fuck was that?
6547997 6550700 I don't know.
6550767 6553537 It was the only way I could<br />get you to come with me.
6553603 6555505 - You got a wife, McClane?<br />- Yeah.
6555572 6558675 I'm surprised anybody would stay<br />with you long enough to be married.
6558742 6561411 Well, she didn't stick around too long.<br />We're sort of separated.
6561478 6563447 What the fuck is<br />sort of separated?
6563513 6566049 Well, she was in L.A.,<br />I was in New York.
6566115 6569919 We had a fight on the phone, she hung up.<br />I didn't call her back.
6569986 6573457 - How long ago was that?<br />- About a year ago now.
6573523 6576860 A year...
6576926 6580063 What the fuck<br />you laughin' about?
6580129 6583366 You threw away your marriage because<br />you were too fuckin' stupid to pick up the phone?
6583433 6585935 What, you think that's funny, huh?<br />You laugh at other people's misfortunes?
6586002 6588104 I bet you blame that shit<br />on your wife too, right?
6588171 6593176 My wife is a very<br />stubborn woman. Yes!
6593242 6597346 - You better stop fuckin' laughin' and undo these cuffs!<br />- I'm almost there!
6597413 6600517 How's that for concentration?<br />Aw, shit!
6600584 6603119 - What?<br />- Fuck! I dropped the thing!
6603186 6605655 - You dropped the fuckin' thing?<br />- Goddamn it!
6605722 6608291 - Oh, shit! Where did it go?<br />- Find it, all right?
6608357 6610293 I don't fuckin' see it.
6610359 6612729 What the fuck is that?
6612796 6615665 I think I made it mad.
6615732 6619869 - Just go, McClane. Get the fuck outta here!<br />- I gotta fuckin' do somethin'.
6619936 6623172 Goddamn it, McClane!<br />Listen to me!
6623239 6625675 Just go.
6625742 6629979 Have a hard enough time gettin' through the day<br />without havin' your death on my conscience.
6630046 6632516 - Shut the fuck up and think, all right?<br />- Tools. Check the engine room.
6632582 6634818 There's no time!
6634884 6637220 - What the hell's it doin' now?<br />- It's mixin'.
6637286 6639623 Shit!
6639689 6642425 - What the hell are you doin'?<br />- Get ready. Lean forward.
6642492 6645228 - What?<br />- Lean forward, goddamn it!
6645294 6648932 - Now it's gonna go fast. Lean forward.<br />- What the fuck you doin'?
6648998 6653002 - Oh, no, no!<br />- Lean forward! Get ready. Move your hands.
6653069 6657340 - Motherfuckin' shit! Shit! Oh, goddamn! Goddamn!<br />- Let's go. Let's go.
6657406 6660443 - Come on! Come on!<br />- Oh, fuck, my leg!
6660510 6662311 Get upstairs!
6662378 6665915 Come on! Go, go, go, go!<br />Get upstairs!
6665982 6669385 Oh, shit!<br />Ow, damn it, my foot!
6669452 6673122 Let's go. Let's go! Down there<br />at the back of the boat. Come on!
6673189 6676092 - Run, goddamn it! Run! Come on!<br />- I am!
6676159 6678327 - All right?<br />- Watch it, watch it! Yeah.
6678394 6680530 Let's go down there<br />to the back...
6708692 6710660 How's he doin'?
6710727 6714964 - I got shot in the leg. How do ya think I'm doin'?<br />- He's gonna be just fine.
6715031 6719002 - How 'bout you?<br />- All right. Got Ricky out of there?
6721104 6724040 Yeah, they found him.
6724107 6727110 - Are you gonna be all right?<br />- Got a bad headache.
6727176 6730379 - Think they're mad at me?<br />- I wouldn't worry about them.
6730446 6733883 They'll get to you eventually, but right now<br />they're busy with this salvage operation, I guess.
6733950 6737353 No! Dre...<br />Dredges. Dredges!
6737420 6740523 - They're wastin' their time. There's no gold out there.<br />- What do you mean?
6740590 6743326 He took it with him.<br />He beat me.
6743392 6746029 - John, he beat all of us.<br />- He wasn't playin' against you.
6746095 6749098 Fuck that, McClane!<br />You're still alive, aren't ya?
6750600 6753837 - Well, aren't ya?<br />- Yeah.
6753903 6756706 So, we lost. Lambert.
6756773 6759408 Would you give him a quarter?
6759475 6761177 Asshole.
6763012 6765514 - Take it easy now.<br />- I got him. That's it.
6765581 6767550 Yeah, this is collect<br />from John.
6767617 6770286 Thanks, guys.<br />Appreciate this.
6774658 6778094 Yeah, Carmine, just tell 'em<br />you'll accept the charges.
6778161 6780596 That son of a bitch<br />had aspirin.
6780664 6785802 Yeah, it's John. Yeah, I'm hangin' in there.<br />Is Holly there? I'll hold on.

6846963 6849565 which country we want to buy!
6854704 6858341 And remember,<br />this is all due...
6858407 6863913 to the gullibility<br />of the New York Police Department!

6921137 6923807 Padre?
6946695 6950166 Lights!<br />Douse those lights!
6970887 6975458 Hey, dick-head,<br />did I come at a bad time?
6980729 6984067 I think she's pissed at you, McClane!
6993609 6996112 Go! Go!
7004820 7007123 - He's under us right now. Come back around.<br />- Run, motherfucker!
7007190 7011027 - What've you got out your side?<br />- Look like roaches with the lights comin' on.
7013696 7017300 - Are we going to Nova Scotia?<br />- You go with the trucks!
7017366 7021037 I have something personal<br />to finish.

7052969 7055104 What the fuck?
7055171 7059075 - Oh, shit! What the fuck is this smoke back here?<br />- We got a chopper behind us!
7059142 7061744 You got a gun on board?<br />What is this?
7064613 7068284 I can't see a goddamn thing. Hold it still.<br />I can't see a goddamn thing.
7072155 7074991 - Oh, shit!<br />- Oh, shit!
7075058 7078361 What do you mean...<br />Oh, shit?
7078427 7082298 - All right, hang on, hang on. We're goin' down.<br />- Between high-tension wires?
7082365 7084968 Hey, McClane, what the fuck!
7086835 7090439 Hey, we got smoke! We got fuckin' smoke<br />and shit flyin' on me here!

7109225 7113196 Look out! Here he comes!
7113262 7115931 - I can't get out, McClane!<br />- Get him outta here.
7115999 7119135 - Where are you goin'?<br />- I'm gonna try and get his attention.
7138021 7141857 Oh, shit! It just keeps<br />gettin' better and better.
