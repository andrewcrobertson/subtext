96986 100739 Lieutenant Jergenson, Hugh Palmer -<br />go to St John's Emergency
100823 103659 in case we got any walk-ins from the street.
103742 108456 Kramer, get the city engineers. I got to find<br />out the damage report. It's important.
108539 111208 Bonwit Teller.<br />Who'd blow up a department store?
111292 113252 Ever see a woman miss a shoe sale?
113335 115713 Connie, get started on a witness sheet.
115796 119216 Ricky, you and Joe make sure<br />the uniforms got it cordoned off.
119300 122845 And you don't let the damn TV crews in.<br />Benson?
122928 124597 - Inspector? Phone.<br />- Not now.
124680 129935 Benson - traffic. We get Fifth Avenue cleared<br />up by 3:00 or we got the traffic jam from hell.
130019 131687 - Walter!<br />- Yeah?
131770 135357 I think you'd better take this.
137193 139403 Major Case Unit. Inspector Cobb.
139487 143991 <i> Said Simple Simon to the</i><br /><i>pieman going to the fair, "Give me your pies...</i>
144074 146869 <i>or I'll cave your head in."</i>
146952 150414 <i>You see, Bonwit's was just</i><br /><i>to make sure I had your attention.</i>
150498 153876 <i>Is there a detective named McClane there?</i>
153959 158964 - He's on suspension.<br /><i>- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.</i>
159048 161717 - Who is this?<br /><i>- Call me Simon.</i>
161801 164887 - What do you want?<br /><i>- I want to play a game.</i>
164970 168349 - What kind of game?<br /><i>- Simon Says.</i>
169391 171936 <i>Simon will tell Lieutenant McClane</i><br /><i>what to do,</i>
172019 175439 <i>and Lieutenant McClane is going to do it.</i>
175523 180611 <i>- Noncompliance will result in a penalty.</i><br />- What penalty?
180694 184198 <i>Another big bang in a very public place.</i>
186659 189578 What is it that you want<br />Lieutenant McClane to do?
189662 195042 <i>Simon says Lieutenant McClane is to go to</i><br /><i>the corner of 138th Street and Amsterdam.</i>
195126 199630 <i>- Which is in Harlem, if I'm not mistaken.</i><br />- Kowalski! Lambert!
199713 203801 - Do you know where to find McClane?<br />- I doubt you'll find him in church.
203884 208889 Well, you'd better find out<br />what rock he's under... and kick it over.
220734 223195 John?
223279 224738 Thanks.
231745 234039 Gimme some more. Come on.
235583 238711 Jesus, John. You look like shit.
242923 245634 Where did we leave off with that roster?
245718 249305 Well, we got three killings<br />in Red Hook the past two nights.
249388 253726 Put Miner on it. And Genetti.<br />The mayor's office'll call later today.
253809 258481 Next, 14 dump trucks stolen<br />from a yard in Staten Island.
258564 262860 14? Jesus. Is somebody startin'<br />a construction company?
262943 267615 Nah, it was John's landlady<br />gonna clean his apartment.
267698 270075 Insurance fraud.
270159 273329 The trucks are probably<br />already out in California.
273412 277875 The contractor splits the money with the<br />thieves. We had it out in Jersey awhile ago.
277958 281420 See what Kelly can do with it.
281504 285966 - What was the lottery number last night?<br />- 4667.
287760 290930 - Still bettin' your badge, Rick?<br />- Yeah.
291013 294350 6991 every week.
294433 296685 6991. Lucky number.
296769 299730 Half the cops in New York play their badges.
299814 302942 How are the kids, John?
303025 305736 I hear they're OK.
305820 308364 Did you talk with Holly?
311033 314578 - No, I didn't talk to Holly.<br />- Comin' up on it, Inspector.
315996 318374 Is it hot in here or am I just scared to death?
318457 321127 You wanna make sure the gun's secure?
321919 324046 Yeah, it's good.
331220 334014 You're the first woman since Holly<br />to see me do this.
334098 337476 - I'm honoured.<br />- Yeah.
337560 339770 So was she.
340688 345276 So, where's the backup gonna be?
348279 351532 We're gonna drop back to 128th Street.
352116 353993 What?
354076 357079 Ten blocks? Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
357163 360458 Oh, man, that's just great.<br />Walter, what is all this about?
360541 363461 If we don't do what he says,<br />he'll blow up a public place.
363544 366839 - Why me? What's he got to do with me?<br />- I have no idea.
366922 369383 He just said it had to be you.
370843 373637 It's nice to be needed.
373721 378476 - Frankly, you haven't been much...<br />- Mind your fuckin' business about Holly.
378559 382396 You and Simon are fuckin' up<br />a perfectly good hangover.
385107 386984 OK.
396327 399288 We'll be back to pick you up in 15 minutes.
399371 402750 Take your time. I expect to be dead in four.
403375 405211 Let's go, Billy.
427733 429610 Man.
456387 459640 - Yo, Uncle.<br />- Come look at this.
460933 464687 - It's after nine. Why aren't you in school?<br />- Tony wants to sell you this.
464770 467940 Tony? That no-neck dude they call Bad T?
468023 469984 He says he found it in a dumpster.
470067 472653 He keeps stealin',<br />they'll find <i>him</i> in a dumpster.
472736 475823 He didn't steal it.<br />He says his uncle gave it to him.
475906 477241 Mm-hm.
477324 479910 Hand me that newspaper over there.
481537 485624 Don't ever let people use you.<br />You're runnin' around with stolen property.
485708 489587 If you get caught, you get in trouble,<br />while he denies it and walks away.
489670 493549 You mean, you want us<br />to take it back to Tony?
493632 497970 No. I'll take it back to Tony, with a message.
498053 500681 - Now, where you goin'?<br />- School.
500764 502433 - Why?<br />- To get educated.
502516 504643 - Why?<br />- So we can go to college.
504727 506937 - And why is that important?<br />- To get 'espect.
507021 509106 "Respect". Now, who's the bad guys?
509190 511692 - Guys who sell drugs.<br />- Guys who have guns.
511775 513944 - And who's the good guys?<br />- We are.
514028 515988 - Who's gonna help you?<br />- Nobody.
516071 518491 - So who's gonna help you?<br />- We help ourselves.
518574 520910 - Who do we not want to help us?<br />- White people.
520993 523788 That's right.
523871 527374 Now get on outta here. Go to school.
531086 533547 - Uncle, you'd better come look at this.<br />- What?
533631 536675 - There's a white man standing in the street.<br />- I seen one.
536759 538677 Not like this.
548395 554151 Dial 911. Tell the police to get up here quick.<br />Somebody's about to get killed.
554235 557154 - Then get your butts to school, you hear me?<br />- Yeah.
557238 559323 All right.
563327 565412 Back off, man.
583764 587518 - Morning.<br />- Good morning.
587601 591105 You havin' a nice day, sir?<br />You feelin' all right?
591188 592773 Not to get too personal,
592857 597611 but a white man standing in Harlem<br />wearin' a sign that says "I hate niggers"
597695 602658 has either got some serious personal issues<br />or not all his dogs are barkin'.
602741 605369 Hey. I'm talkin' to you.
605453 608289 You got about ten seconds<br />before those guys see you.
608372 611208 When they do, they will kill you.<br />You understand?
611292 615087 You are about to have a very bad day.
615171 619800 Tell me about it. Sir, this is a police matter.<br />For your own safety...
619884 624680 Damn right it is. For <i>your</i> own safety, hide<br />your butt in my shop till the police get here.
624763 627141 What the fuck...?
628684 631437 Oh, shit.
638068 642865 I'm a cop. I'm on a case. Somebody blew up<br />Bonwit Teller's. Did you hear about that?
642948 647411 The asshole that did that said I had to do this,<br />or he's gonna blow up somethin' else.
647495 648662 Shit, shit, shit.
648746 650581 - I got a gun.<br />- They got ten guns.
650664 654794 Look, start acting crazy.<br />Like loony tunes, you know? Like Bellevue.
654877 659423 - Hey, Zeus. This a friend of yours?<br />- He look like a friend of mine?
659507 664887 I think the dude just escaped from<br />some hospital, you know? Like Bellevue.
667807 672102 I am the... voice of my own god.
672186 674146 And my god...
674230 679652 I told the librarian that I had a bad headache,<br />but she didn't believe me. I really do, though.
679735 683572 - My head does not feel good!<br />- Shut the fuck up.
683656 686867 You've made a very bad mistake.
688452 690412 Cut that shit off.
690496 695793 Fellas, fellas. Nature Boy here hates niggers.<br />Now what are we gonna do about that?
696335 698587 Yo, yo, hold up, hold up...
698671 699922 Shit.
703926 706095 - Back! Back up.<br />- What you trippin' on?
707012 709223 Back the fuck up. Now!
710349 712184 Come on, man, get up.
713435 715563 Get outta here.
715646 719316 - Stop the cab. Stop the goddamn cab.<br />- Don't shoot me.
719400 721318 Get up. Come on, get up.
721402 724447 Back up. I don't want to, but I will.<br />You know I will.
724530 726115 Come on. Drive.
726198 728868 - Drive! Go! Go!<br />- Get the fuck outta here.
728951 731370 Drive. Drive.
731454 734832 Don't stop, don't stop, just keep drivin'.<br />Run the red light.
734915 738419 - That's all I got.<br />- Put that fuckin' money away, asshole.
738502 740671 - Shit.<br />- Just run all the lights. Drive.
740754 742882 - You got it, boss.<br />- Damn.
742965 744758 - That cut deep?<br />- How would I know?
744842 747178 Just keep pressure on it.
747261 749722 Oh, fuck.
749805 752266 Jesus, right? John McClane. I owe you one.
752349 755311 Damn right. You know what<br />those guys are doing to my shop?
755394 759064 - Chill out.<br />- You relating to me? Talk like a white man.
759148 760608 Look, Jesus, I'm sorry...
760691 764445 - "Jesus"? I look Puerto Rican to you?<br />- Guy back there called you Jesus.
764528 768574 He didn't say "Jesus", he said, "Hey, Zeus".<br />My name is Zeus.
768657 770201 - Zeus?<br />- Yeah, Zeus.
770284 775039 As in father of Apollo? Don't fuck with me<br />or I'll shove a lightning bolt up your ass?
775122 777708 Zeus! You got a problem with that?
778334 781045 No. I don't have a problem with that.
781128 785174 - Downtown. Police Plaza.<br />- Oh, that's just great.
789178 795142 I need a record of his collars, recent releases,<br />and anybody he might've looked at sideways.
796393 797853 It's textbook megalomania.
797937 803150 It's a pathological state in which fantasies<br />of control or omnipotence predominate.
803234 806946 He wants control over him -<br />his actions, thoughts, even his emotions.
807029 810658 - Sounds like a secret admirer.<br />- Maybe he'll send me flowers.
810741 816163 - Everybody knows you like pansies.<br />- It's not that kind of emotion. This guy's ugly.
816247 819667 - How is that?<br />- Nothin' wrong a shower wouldn't cure.
819750 822419 Beer is normally taken internally, John.
822503 826757 - Just give me some aspirins, will you?<br />- Yeah, OK. Hold this here.
826841 830511 - This is Fred Schiller, John. He's a...<br />- Shrink. Yeah, I got it.
830594 835808 Yes. We're dealing with a megalomaniacal<br />personality with paranoid schizophrenic...
835891 840146 Let's skip down to the part where you<br />tell me what the fuck this has to do with me.
840229 844358 I don't know. What I do know is<br />it does have specifically to do with you.
844441 847695 This guy wants to pound on you<br />until you crumble.
847778 853075 - He wants you to dance to his tune, then...<br />- Put on a dress and fuck me?
853159 855286 I was going to say "kill you".
856120 858122 He's sitting on an awful lot of rage.
858205 861625 And it could be manifested physically<br />if he's stressed.
861709 865754 - Somebody he arrested or pissed off...<br />- That could be one helluva long list.
865838 868966 - Fuck you, Joe.<br />- These people don't like anonymity.
869049 873846 They want you to know who's doing it to you.<br />So this name Simon is probably not an alias.
873929 876307 It's probably Simon or some variation.
876390 881812 Simon, Robert E. Extortion, kidnapping.<br />10-15. Did seven years for good behaviour.
881896 884732 - Released on work furlough two months ago.<br />- Check it.
884815 886192 Thanks, Rick.
886275 889945 He was a bankrupt businessman<br />who kidnapped his partner's daughter.
890029 892865 He's a fuck-up, not a psycho.<br />The guy we want is nuts.
892948 895868 A nut who knows a lot about bombs.
895951 901916 We found this in a playground. Professional.<br />Very cool stuff. You know... boom.
901999 906003 - Should you slam it around like that?<br />- It's unmixed. You can't hurt it.
906086 909882 - This stuff is cutting-edge. It's a binary liquid.<br />- A what?
909965 912718 Like epoxy. Two liquids.
913761 916555 Either one by itself...
917848 921310 You got nothin'. But mix 'em...
932404 934031 Ricky?
938536 941038 You're gonna be wearin'<br />that shirt up your ass!
941122 944458 - Christ almighty, Charlie!<br />- Like I said, very cool stuff.
944542 947086 Now, with a package like this<br />you get a warning.
947169 949046 The bomb has to arm itself.
949130 953592 You'll see the red liquid<br />pump into the clear before it detonates.
953676 957054 - How long before?<br />- Ten seconds, two minutes.
957138 962143 Could be anything.<br />But once it's mixed, be somewhere else.
962226 966313 This stuff has got to be rare. We ought<br />to be able to find out if any is missing.
966397 969817 I already did. Livermore Labs.<br />Theft over the weekend.
969900 974113 - He got enough to make another one, Joe?<br />- About 2,000 pounds.
974196 975448 Of that?
975531 978951 The detonating mechanism can be anything.<br />Radio, electrical...
979034 981412 Hell, you could use a beeper and phone it in.
981495 983831 Inspector? Inspector, it's him.
983914 986834 This one's got a double<br />Alberti feedback loop on it...
986917 989545 Charlie? Charlie.
990463 991505 Start the trace.
999638 1001182 Simon.
1001265 1004435 <i>He wore the board,</i><br /><i>walked the street and survived.</i>
1004518 1007855 <i>Hauptmann Walter,</i><br /><i>where are my pigeons now?</i>
1007938 1009773 Pigeons?
1009857 1013527 <i>"I had two pigeons bright and gay</i><br /><i>fly from me the other day."</i>
1013611 1017072 <i>"Why was it they did go?</i><br /><i>You cannot tell, you do not know."</i>
1017156 1021452 - You mean McClane?<br /><i>- No, I mean Santa Claus.</i>
1023537 1027792 - Yeah, I'm here.<br /><i>- Ah, there after all. And your friend?</i>
1027875 1031545 Carver. Carver.<br />We need you in the other room. Let's go.
1031629 1034089 - Come on.<br />- They need you. Go.
1034173 1037092 - Yeah, he's here, too.<br /><i>- And may I speak with him?</i>
1039053 1042723 <i>- Is the ebony Samaritan there now?</i><br />- You got a problem with ebony?
1042807 1044141 <i>No, no.</i>
1044225 1048395 <i>My only problem is that I went to some</i><br /><i>trouble preparing that game for McClane.</i>
1048479 1050731 <i>You interfered with a well-laid plan.</i>
1050815 1055194 Yeah? Well, you can stick your well-laid plan<br />up your well-laid ass.
1057446 1061450 That was not smart.<br />There are lives at stake here.
1061534 1065204 - Not enough time, Inspector.<br />- You'd better hope he calls back.
1065287 1066872 He will.
1068833 1072128 Ricky, you wanna tell those people<br />to shut up out there?
1072211 1074213 Hey. Keep it down here.
1083097 1086600 Simon... He wasn't speaking for all of us.
1086684 1090020 <i>That was unpleasant.</i><br /><i>Don't let it happen again.</i>
1090104 1093399 <i>- So, what's your name, boy?</i><br />- Don't call me "boy".
1093482 1096777 <i>I'm sorry. It was a poor attempt at humour.</i>
1096861 1099238 <i>I was going to send you home with a chiding.</i>
1099321 1104994 <i>- But now I think you should join the game.</i><br />- We got him. It's a payphone. In Oslo.
1105077 1106328 Norway?
1106412 1109790 - Wait. Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Forget it.
1109874 1112835 Australia? He's scrambling up their system.
1112918 1115838 <i>Having fun with the phone company, are we?</i>
1115921 1118674 <i>Simon says McClane and the Samaritan</i>
1118757 1121760 <i>will go to the subway station</i><br /><i>at 72nd and Broadway.</i>
1121844 1125139 <i>I will call you in 15 minutes</i><br /><i>on the payphone outside the station.</i>
1125222 1129018 <i>No police. Failure to answer</i><br /><i>will constitute non-compliance.</i>
1129101 1131604 <i>Do you understand me, John?</i>
1131687 1133606 Oh, yes, I understand.
1133689 1137193 I understand you're a fuckin' wacko<br />that likes to play kids' games.
1137276 1139236 <i>- Hardly.</i><br />- Hardly?
1139320 1141781 Well, who are you? Somebody I sent up?
1141864 1145409 What did you do?<br />Shoplifting? Purse-snatching?
1145493 1146952 Cross-dressing? What?
1147036 1151415 <i>You c-c-couldn't catch me</i><br /><i>if I stole your ch-ch-chair with you in it.</i>
1151499 1155294 My ch-ch-chair with me in it?<br />Ooh! That's very exciting.
1155377 1159298 Let me ask you a question, bonehead.<br />Why are you trying to k-k-kill me?
1159381 1161300 John, John. calm yourself.
1161383 1166222 Why don't you come on down here and we'll<br />figure this out like a couple of men, huh?
1166305 1170518 <i>- If killing you was all I wanted, you'd be dead.</i><br />- Simon. This is Inspector Cobb.
1170601 1176065 I can appreciate your feelings for McClane.<br />But believe me, the jerk isn't worth it.
1176148 1181153 He's stepped on so many toes here, by this<br />time next month he'll be a security guard.
1181237 1183405 His own wife wants nothing to do with him,
1183489 1186659 and he's about two steps shy<br />of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.
1186742 1189370 One step, one step.
1189453 1191539 Now, listen to me.
1191622 1195209 You sound like a real smart guy.<br />What is it that you want?
1195292 1199338 <i>- Are you talking about money?</i><br />- Well, whatever, whatever.
1200381 1202925 McClane is a toilet bug.
1203008 1206595 What would it take just to forget him<br />and live happily ever after?
1206679 1208639 <i>You know, money is shit to me.</i>
1208722 1213102 <i>I would not give up McClane</i><br /><i>for all the gold in your Fort Knox.</i>
1213185 1218023 <i>72nd Street subway payphone, 15 minutes,</i><br /><i>McClane and the Samaritan.</i>
1218107 1221152 <i>If you're competent in the least,</i><br /><i>you found the briefcase,</i>
1221235 1224447 <i>so you know what I mean by penalty.</i>
1227032 1231078 - Thanks for that vote of confidence, Walter.<br />- I thought it was worth a try.
1231162 1235124 - This guy's a raving maniac.<br />- He's as clear as a case history.
1235207 1238419 He gave clues to his identity.<br />He spoke German,
1238502 1242256 he said "your Fort Knox", and he stammered<br />when McClane pushed him.
1242339 1245634 - You believe this guy really can't be bought?<br />- No chance.
1245718 1249054 The very mention of money<br />only enraged him further.
1256729 1260357 - What's that?<br />- It's your shield.
1260441 1262985 - Are you asking me to be a cop again?<br />- Get his gun.
1263068 1264612 - You didn't answer me.<br />- Joe...
1264695 1266864 Hey.
1266947 1269742 You didn't answer my question, Walter.
1270409 1273120 Are you done, Lieutenant?
1273204 1276499 You two better get going<br />to get up to 72nd Street on time.
1276582 1279502 - Joe, this time they go with backup.<br />- You got it.
1279585 1281837 Whoa, whoa. I'm not goin' anywhere.
1281921 1286008 - Simon says you gotta go.<br />- I'm not jumpin' through hoops for a psycho.
1286091 1289094 That's a white man with white problems.<br />You deal with him.
1289178 1292056 - Call me when he crosses 110th Street.<br />- Hey.
1293098 1295726 - Why'd you save my ass?<br />- I didn't.
1295810 1298270 I stopped a white cop<br />gettin' killed in Harlem.
1298354 1302316 One white cop gets killed today,<br />tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,
1302399 1305569 all of 'em with itchy trigger fingers. Got it?
1306987 1308656 Get him back.
1310866 1313661 - Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?<br />- Chinatown.
1313744 1315371 Shit.
1315454 1318290 Yo! Yo, partner. Wait up.
1318374 1322336 I ain't your partner. I ain't your neighbour,<br />your brother or your friend.
1322419 1325047 I'm your total stranger.
1325131 1327758 OK, stranger.
1327842 1332096 You know where that park is<br />at 115th Street and St Nicholas?
1333305 1337101 - Yeah, it's in Harlem.<br />- Where do you think we found that bomb?
1337184 1341355 Listen. This guy doesn't<br />care about skin colour.
1341438 1343816 Even if you do.
1344900 1348446 - What am I doin'?<br />- Cheer up. Things could be worse.
1348529 1353284 I was workin' on a fat suspension, smokin'<br />cigarettes and watchin' <i>Captain Kangaroo.</i>
1353951 1355828 Come on.
1364128 1366672 They made it to the phone,<br />but there's a problem.
1366755 1371844 <i>- What do you mean? How big a problem?</i><br />- About 300 pounds.
1371927 1374805 - Excuse me, ma'am. We need this phone.<br />- Do you mind?
1374889 1377141 - Honey, I'm a cop.<br />- I'm sorry, but...
1377224 1379602 Get off the damn phone! Police business!
1379685 1382146 - Well, I never.<br />- I can get used to this.
1382229 1385065 I'm sure you can find a phone<br />across the street.
1385149 1388944 Let's get something straight.<br />I'm the only one on police business.
1389028 1392698 Let's get somethin' else straight.<br />You need me more than I need you.
1392782 1396535 You don't like the way I do things, fine. I quit.
1404794 1407505 All right, I need you.
1412635 1416180 All right, I need you more than you need me.
1419934 1420601 Hello?
1420684 1423604 <i>Birds of a feather flock together,</i><br /><i>so do pigs and swine.</i>
1423687 1426649 <i>Rats and mice have their chance,</i><br /><i>as will I have mine.</i>
1426732 1428609 Nice. It rhymes.
1428692 1432613 <i>- The phone was busy. Who were you calling?</i><br />- The psychic hotline.
1432696 1436200 <i>- Take this more seriously.</i><br />- It's a public phone. What can I say?
1436283 1442081 <i>Simply say there was a fat woman on it</i><br /><i>and it took you a minute to get her off.</i>
1442164 1448003 <i>Now, John, there's a significant amount of</i><br /><i>explosive in the trash receptacle next to you.</i>
1449630 1454260 <i>- Try to run and it goes up now.</i><br />- Nobody's running, but I got 100 people here.
1454343 1458180 <i>That's the point.</i><br /><i>Now, do I have your attention?</i>
1458264 1460933 <i>As I was going to St lves</i><br /><i>I met a man with seven wives.</i>
1461016 1465104 <i>Every wife had seven sacks. Every sack had</i><br /><i>seven cats. Every cat had seven kittens.</i>
1465187 1469942 <i>Kittens, cats, sacks and wives, how many</i><br /><i>were going to St lves? My phone number is...</i>
1470025 1472945 - Wait. I didn't get that. Say it again.<br /><i>- Not a chance.</i>
1473028 1478742 <i>My phone number is 555 and the answer.</i><br /><i>Call me in 30 seconds or die. </i>
1481412 1484206 - Seven guys with seven...<br />- Shut up. I'm good at this.
1484290 1486292 - Seven guys and...<br />- Shut the fuck up!
1486375 1490504 He said seven wives with seven sacks.<br />7 times 7 is 49. Tell me the rest.
1490588 1493507 - A sack with seven sacks...<br />- Weren't you listening?
1493591 1496635 - What is wrong with you?<br />- A bad fuckin' hangover!
1496719 1499430 All right. Seven wives times seven, 49.
1499513 1502475 With seven cats.<br />Seven times 49 is... 343, right?
1502558 1507938 - You askin' me or tellin' me?<br />- I'm telling you. 343 times seven is...
1508022 1510983 - 2,401. That's what you got, right?<br />- Yeah.
1511066 1515863 - Is that it? 2401?<br />- That's it, dial. 555-2401.
1517323 1520284 - No, wait. It's a trick.<br />- What do you mean?
1520367 1523078 - I forgot the man.<br />- Fuck the man! We got ten seconds.
1523162 1525289 He said, "How many were going to St lves?"
1525372 1529084 The riddle begins, "As I was going to St lves<br />I met a man with seven wives."
1529168 1531086 The guy and his wives are going nowhere.
1531170 1534590 - What are they doin'?<br />- Sittin' in the fuckin' road! How do I know?
1534673 1538344 - Who's going to St lves, then?<br />- The guy. Just the guy.

1540554 1542973 - How do you dial one?<br />- 555-0001.
1543057 1546185 - 0001. Just one guy's goin'.<br /><i>- Hello, John.</i>
1546268 1548729 Piece of cake. Give us something harder.

1551565 1554360 - <i>Boom.</i><br />- There's a bomb in the trash!

1565871 1568040 Welcome to New York.
1570084 1572086 They were just talking.
1572169 1576257 Let's get out of here. Come on.<br />Come on, let's go.
1590354 1592523 Bomb.
1598154 1599029 Yeah.
1599113 1601699 <i>I didn't say "Simon says".</i>
1601782 1606704 <i>It's 9:50, John.</i><br /><i>The number 3 train is arriving now.</i>

1630769 1634482 90 blocks in 30 minutes in New York traffic?
1634565 1638944 It could be double that.<br />We don't even have a car.
1639028 1642865 Hey, sir! I'm a cop. I am requisitioning<br />this car for police business.
1642948 1645451 What you doing?!<br />What you doing with my cab?
1645534 1649413 Pretty slick. I used to drive a cab.<br />The fastest way south is...
1650414 1652917 What the fuck are you doing?!
1657505 1659298 What were you sayin'?
1659381 1664261 I was saying, I used to drive a cab<br />and Ninth Avenue was the fastest way south.
1664345 1666096 But we seem to be going east.
1671852 1674814 Where the hell are you goin'?<br />I told you Ninth Avenue was...
1674897 1679110 - Stop yelling. I know what I'm doin'!<br />- Not even God knows what you're doin'.
1679193 1681862 They're headed east on 72nd<br />towards the park.
1681946 1685157 - Wall Street is south.<br />- Stop yellin' at me. I got a headache.
1685241 1689995 And the best way south is not Ninth Avenue.<br />It's through the park.
1690079 1691288 Oh, dear.
1692665 1696877 - I told you Park Drive was always jammed.<br />- I didn't say Park Drive.
1699338 1701632 I said through the park.
1704343 1707221 Shit. We lost 'em.<br />They're in the park, headed south.

1812368 1814787 - We need a fire truck.<br />- What?
1814870 1816956 To follow.
1820042 1822503 - <i>911.</i><br />- Lieutenant John McClane, NYPD,

1833806 1837309 Emergency calls go to Roosevelt Hospital,<br />two blocks from here.
1864587 1866505 Slow the fuck down, McClane.
1866589 1870342 Kinda like football, isn't it?<br />Get a blocker, head for the end zone.
1873846 1876265 Say Wall Street, he'd have gone all the way.
1876348 1881479 Wrong. South of 14th Street's<br />a different hospital. St Luke's.
1881562 1883272 Hang on.
1891363 1893574 Time?

1921560 1924939 - What are you gonna do?<br />- Get that bomb. You fail, I cover your ass.
1925022 1928859 - I fail, you cover mine.<br />- And if we both fail?
1928943 1933447 Then we're both fucked. Go now, drive.<br />Get to that phone booth by 10:20. Go.

2414136 2416972 We got a couple of questions first.
2417056 2419642 You recognise this guy?
2423604 2425606 No.
2425689 2427983 How about this one?
2431028 2433864 - Mm-mm.<br />- How about you?
2434865 2437576 Did you recognise the voice on the phone?
2437660 2439578 No.
2439662 2442748 Have you noticed<br />any cars following you, or...?
2445918 2446877 No.
2446961 2450131 Anybody following you at all?<br />Any kind of surveillance?
2450214 2453509 Telephone, house, anything unusual at all?
2454552 2456345 Well...
2456428 2461934 Now that you mention it, I have experienced<br />a... burning sensation between my toes.
2462017 2465563 I thought it was just some<br />athlete's foot or somethin'.
2468023 2472111 We read your jacket, Lieutenant.<br />We were told you would be cooperative.
2472194 2475281 - Cooperate with what? We're wasting time.<br />- Wait a minute.
2475364 2479034 You want to share information,<br />how about sending a little our way?
2479118 2482121 - We wanna hear what he knows first.<br />- What the hell?
2482204 2487710 - We want to hear what he knows first.<br />- Hey, I know as much as you know, all right?
2487793 2492006 There's a guy out there settin' off bombs.<br />He calls himself Simon.
2492089 2496969 He speaks with a German accent,<br />and for some reason he's very angry with me.
2497052 2500139 Now maybe you can tell me why, fellas, huh?
2505478 2507688 First man there is Mathias Targo.
2507772 2512276 Was Hungarian army. Explosives expert.<br />Now we believe he's working for the Iranians.
2512359 2516572 - Working?<br />- Freelance terrorism. By contract.
2517782 2519784 - Who's the girl?<br />- Targo's other half.
2519867 2523537 Rumour is the Israelis slipped a bomb<br />in between their sheets.
2523621 2526373 He wasn't at home,<br />but they think maybe they got her.
2526457 2530836 The second man was an obscure colonel<br />in the East German army.
2530920 2535216 Ran an infiltration unit, the kind of thing<br />the Nazis did at the Battle of the Bulge.
2535299 2538636 - English-speaking troops...<br />- Yeah, I saw the movie.
2539595 2544850 All we know of him is the GDR medical<br />records show he suffers from migraines.
2544934 2548062 His name is Peter Krieg.
2550189 2553734 Well, that is an exceptional report, fellas.
2553818 2556362 Now do you wanna tell me<br />what this has to do with me?
2556445 2560407 The name "Gruber" mean<br />anything to you, Lieutenant?
2563661 2566288 It rings a bell, yeah.
2566372 2569625 LA. That thing in the building in LA.
2572211 2578425 Peter Krieg was born Simon Peter Gruber.
2579426 2582763 He's Hans Gruber's brother.
2586892 2590855 - Shit.<br />- Yeah. It's that thing in LA.
2590938 2596944 We figure he's got you fitted up for a toe tag,<br />and he's gonna do anything to get it tied.
2597278 2600197 Inspector. Inspector, it's him.
2601532 2604160 Don't let him know we're here.
2607288 2610249 - Simon.<br />- <i>Inspector.</i>
2610332 2613169 <i>Now, who from the FBI</i><br /><i>is in the van, I wonder?</i>
2613252 2616589 <i>Let's see. Almost certainly Cross.</i><br /><i>Come on, Andrew, say hello.</i>
2616672 2618215 Hello.
2618299 2621635 <i>And I know you never run alone,</i><br /><i>so say hello, Bill.</i>
2621719 2625473 <i>Still trying to butch up</i><br /><i>by chewing on your glasses?</i>
2627099 2630853 <i>This, gentlemen, as they say,</i><br /><i>is where the plot thickens.</i>
2632104 2637568 <i>I have put 2400 pounds of explosive in</i><br /><i>one of the 1446 schools in Greater New York.</i>
2637651 2642406 <i>It is fitted with a timer</i><br /><i>set to explode at exactly 3pm.</i>
2643449 2645993 <i>Thank you. Your silence says I'm understood.</i>
2646076 2650831 - Did you say 2400 pounds?<br /><i>- Yes, but please don't interrupt again.</i>
2650915 2655753 <i>Simon says, if you attempt to evacuate</i><br /><i>schools, the bomb will be detonated by radio.</i>
2655836 2658130 <i>And, gentlemen, someone will be watching.</i>
2658214 2662968 <i>Repeat- one school will be dismissed</i><br /><i>at 3pm, permanently. Unless...</i>
2663052 2664136 Unless what?
2664220 2668307 <i>Unless John McClane and his new best friend</i><br /><i>complete the tasks I set them.</i>
2668390 2670476 <i>John, are you listening?</i>
2672061 2673521 Yeah.
2673604 2676565 <i>The payphone beyond Hope,</i><br /><i>Tompkins Square Park.</i>
2676649 2679485 <i>20 minutes. Go by foot. No rush.</i>
2679568 2683823 <i>If you're clever you'll learn the location</i><br /><i>of the bomb and the code to disarm it.</i>
2683906 2688953 <i>Oh, and by the way, gentlemen, we got</i><br /><i>something of a bargain on radio detonators.</i>
2689036 2693582 <i>The only problem is the darn things seem</i><br /><i>to respond to police and FBI frequencies.</i>
2693666 2697169 <i>So, if I were you, I'd keep off your radios.</i>
2697253 2699338 Simon, wait...
2703175 2707346 2400 pounds of that liquid stuff. My God.
2708514 2709807 Get the commissioner.
2709890 2712685 He's in a press conference.<br />He's due in half an hour.
2712768 2715938 Ricky, get every senior officer on the site<br />here right away.
2716021 2718399 You gonna try any jurisdictional nonsense?
2718482 2723237 I got two kids in the school on 64th Street.<br />What can I do to help you?
2723320 2725489 - How many men have you got?<br />- 75.
2725573 2728117 If I push the panic button, I can get 500.
2728200 2730286 - When?<br />- Two thirty, three o'clock.
2730369 2732663 Between now and then...
2732746 2737126 We're gonna have to do this<br />all by ourselves. Let's go.
2737209 2741172 The park is over two miles away,<br />so you guys better get running. No radios.
2741255 2745176 Take my telephone. You get anything,<br />you call me through the switchboard.
2745259 2747553 - Good luck.<br />- Thanks.
2747636 2749555 Find that bomb.
2749638 2751557 - Ricky, where are they?<br />- Over here.
2751640 2754477 - Senior man present is Chief Allen.<br />- Chief of what?
2754560 2756771 - Transit.<br />- OK, thanks, Ricky.
2756854 2761275 Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.<br />Chief Allen. The man who has done this
2761358 2767406 has told us he has planted another very large<br />bomb in a school here in the New York area.
2767490 2772077 He has told us that we cannot evacuate,<br />but he has not said that we cannot search.
2772161 2775164 I recommend we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody -
2775247 2779376 police, transit, sanitation, fire,<br />even the goddamn librarians -
2779460 2783214 and we start searching schools,<br />and I mean right now.
2783297 2786133 There's a thousand buildings<br />within the city limits,
2786217 2788844 and we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it in.
2788928 2791764 I'd like to keep the media out<br />as long as possible,
2791847 2796769 because if they get in, we've got a panic.<br />Are we in agreement?
2796852 2799855 All right, come on, guys. Let's go.
2799939 2802066 Move it out. Move it out.
2802149 2806320 No radio contact.<br />There will be no radio contact.
2814954 2817081 They bought it.
2818541 2820000 You can begin.
2834682 2837810 Hook, line...
2840312 2842815 and sinker.
2847403 2850072 You heard the man. Let's go. Let's go.
2883773 2887026 Sergeant Turley. Sergeant Turley!
2887109 2891197 In the last five minutes the volume of calls<br />has tripled. What is going on?
2891280 2894200 Stop. Let me explain.
2894283 2897495 For the rest of the day,<br />we're to handle our communication.
2897578 2901916 - What do you mean, "handle"?<br />- They're shutting down the police band.
2901999 2906212 - All calls will be through this switchboard.<br />- And I'll marry Donald Trump.
2906545 2910674 Walsh, what's goin' on?<br />Why'd everybody tear out of here?
2910758 2912843 Come on, Pamela, look at your watch.
2912927 2916514 It's shift change.<br />The bean-counters worry about overtime,
2916597 2920768 so we sent everybody back to the precinct<br />to punch out. The next shift is coming.
2920851 2923187 You are so full of shit, Walsh.
2923646 2925731 Thank you.
2932321 2934406 What the hell...?
2943791 2946293 Hey, whoa. Whoa, whoa!
2946377 2952174 Detective. Bob Thompson,<br />City Engineers' Office.
2952258 2954969 We'd like to get an idea of the damage.
2957179 2960141 Man, you guys really got here fast.
2961100 2962852 Well...
2962935 2964979 It's Wall Street, sir.
2965062 2967231 Lot of money here.
2967314 2972695 Lot of opinion-makers the mayor<br />doesn't want to piss off, you know.
2973737 2975823 Is this it?
2978117 2980411 Holy Toledo.
2981454 2984248 Somebody had fun.
2984331 2988627 I'd appreciate it if you'd show<br />my associates the way down.
2990379 2991839 Yeah, yeah, sure.
2991922 2997136 Jimmy. You got the flashlight?<br />Murphy, come on. You too.
2997219 2999555 - Rick Walsh.<br />- John Gunther.
2999638 3001766 Come on, gentlemen, let's go.
3005227 3008606 You were probably at the World Trade.<br />You know what that mess was.
3041388 3045142 Please inform Mr Little<br />that Mr Vanderfloog is here.
3045226 3047436 Mr Vanderfloog?
3049563 3052274 There's a Mr Vanderfloog for Mr Little.
3066163 3069750 Go down 20 metres.<br />Come on.
3069834 3073921 - A lot of steam down here.<br />- Yeah, we snapped a couple of steam pipes.
3074004 3076590 The subway guys shut down the third rail.
3076674 3079176 - Some emergency lighting.<br />- There's still some...
3079260 3081387 Hey!
3081470 3083472 No shooting.
3083556 3086767 - Speak English.<br />- Otto doesn't speak English. Do you, Otto?
3086851 3091397 - Where the hell did we get this guy?<br />- He's one of Targo's thugs.
3092565 3095609 Pull all the way up.<br />Pull all the way. Pull all the way,
3102575 3105119 What's this LA thing?<br />You famous or somethin'?
3105202 3107413 Yeah, for about five minutes.
3107496 3110124 - Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?<br />- Fuck you.
3110207 3112543 - This guy Simon we're talkin' to?<br />- Yeah.
3112626 3117298 I threw his little brother off the 32nd floor<br />of Nakatomi Towers out in LA.
3117381 3119592 I guess he's a little pissed off about it.
3119675 3124722 So I'm in this shit cos some white cop threw<br />some white asshole's brother off a roof?
3169975 3172686 Mr Vanderfloog?<br />Felix Little, corporate relations.
3172770 3176190 Sorry you had to wait,<br />but there was an explosion in the subway.
3176273 3178109 It's played hell with our alarms.
3178192 3182363 - I trust there's nothing wrong?<br />- Oh, no. Good Lord, no. Safe and secure.
3182446 3185533 Now, you were concerned<br />about a currency exchange.
3185616 3188786 We are not a commercial bank<br />in the normal sense.
3188869 3194291 We're primarily... governments,<br />central banks, that sort of thing.
3194375 3197962 - Apart from the depository, of course.<br />- Of course.
3198045 3200881 And you are in the flower business,<br />Mr Vanderfloog?
3204635 3206720 Back! Back!<br />Come on!
3231537 3232580 Come on.
3246677 3250890 Oh, no, Mr Vanderfloog,<br />that's the vault elevator.
3250973 3254351 I'm sorry. Our alarms are sonic and seismic,
3254435 3257730 two things which, I'm afraid,<br />do not react well to explosions.
3257813 3261317 This subway business has knocked<br />our systems into a cocked hat.
3261400 3264320 We've had to give up<br />and pull the plug on the whole thing.
3264403 3268491 - The repair people are downstairs now.<br />- Good Lord.
3268574 3271702 Heavens to Betsy, if anyone knew...
3274955 3278918 But I thought this was a currency exchange.
3279001 3282046 I think we go straight to the withdrawal.
3285549 3288135 <i>Dank u wel.</i>
3296519 3298604 <i>Ich bin fertig.</i>
3330177 3335307 Captain, you wanna come down here<br />and take a look at this? Something's goin' on.
3335391 3338477 - Think you'll be able to fix that?<br />- Just a minute, now.
3343065 3344316 OK. I'll be right back.
3344400 3346527 Down!
3350448 3352658 Stay back.
3353075 3355494 Stay back!
3387943 3390362 Come on, come on.
3401081 3404543 <i>- Front desk?</i><br />- Call the police. I'm under attack!
3404627 3408297 <i>Hey, just relax, mate.</i><br /><i>Maybe you'll live through this.</i>
3408380 3409632 Shit!
3432196 3434365 I think he's dead, my dear.
3436951 3439328 <i>Lieutenant,</i> see to the office workers.
3439411 3441914 It's being done<i>, Herr Oberst.</i>
3444792 3446752 And the square?
3446836 3449421 Perimeter secure<i>, Herr Oberst.</i>
3483664 3486876 One hundred and forty billion dollars!
3487918 3490880 Ten times what's in Kentucky.
3490963 3492798 Fort Knox. Huh!
3492882 3495092 It's for tourists.
3508314 3510483 Yeah? McClane.
3510566 3513986 <i>John, you're out of shape. You barely made it.</i>
3514069 3517740 Yeah, well, we all barely make it.<br />What do you want us to do?
3517823 3520910 <i>What has four legs</i><br /><i>and is always ready to travel?</i>
3520993 3523245 - Huh?<br /><i>- </i>
3523329 3524371 What'd he say?
3524455 3527166 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3527249 3530503 Don't you have kids? That's an elephantjoke.
3536217 3538511 Whoa.
3538594 3540721 That a bomb?
3540805 3543599 - Yeah. Just go ahead and grab it.<br />- No, you're the cop.
3543682 3546477 - Simon says you should be helpin'.<br />- I'm helpin'.
3546560 3550731 - When are you gonna start helpin'?<br />- After you get the bomb.
3567331 3569917 - Careful.<br />- What do you mean, "careful"?
3570000 3573671 - Don't open it.<br />- What? I gotta open it.
3573754 3576715 And it's gonna be all right.
3587226 3591147 <i>- </i><br />- Shit. Shit! I told you not to open it.
3595609 3597820 <i>I trust you see the message.</i>
3597903 3601240 <i>It has a proximity circuit, so please don't run.</i>
3601323 3604660 I got it. We're not gonna run.<br />How do we turn this thing off?
3604743 3606996 On the fountain there are two jugs.
3607079 3610708 <i>Do you see them?</i><br /><i>A five-gallon and a three-gallon.</i>
3610791 3616172 <i>Fill one of the jugs with exactly four gallons</i><br /><i>of water and place it on the scale,</i>
3616255 3619633 <i>and the timer will stop. You must be precise.</i>
3619717 3622887 <i>One ounce more or less</i><br /><i>will result in detonation.</i>
3622970 3626098 <i>- If you're alive in five minutes, we'll speak.</i><br />- Wait...
3630770 3633355 - I don't get it. Do you get it?<br />- No.
3635107 3637276 Get the jugs.
3638360 3641781 Obviously we can't fill<br />the three-gallon jug with four gallons.
3641864 3644617 - Obviously.<br />- All right, I know.
3644700 3647787 We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?
3647870 3650956 We pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug,
3651040 3654835 giving us exactly three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug, right?
3654919 3657922 Take the three-gallon jug,<br />fill it a third of the way up...
3658005 3660466 No. He said be precise. Exactly four gallons.
3660549 3666263 Every cop in 50 miles is runnin' his ass off<br />and I'm playing kids' games in the park.
3666347 3669016 You wanna focus on the problem at hand?
3685116 3688536 You said you knew! You said<br />don't say anything if you don't know!
3688619 3692206 - Gimme the jug! We're startin' over.<br />- No. We can't start over!
3692289 3694708 I'm gonna put my foot up your ass,<br />you dumb...
3694792 3697169 Say it, say it!
3697253 3699547 - You were gonna call me a nigger.<br />- I wasn't!
3699630 3703884 - What were you gonna call me?<br />- Asshole! How's that? Asshole!
3703968 3706971 You got some fuckin' problem<br />with me cos I'm white, Zeus?
3707054 3709932 Have I oppressed you?<br />Have I oppressed your people?
3710015 3712935 Your problem is<br />you don't like me cos you're a racist.
3713018 3715396 - What?<br />- You don't like me cos I'm white.
3715479 3719316 I don't like you because you're gonna<br />get me killed! How much time?
3719400 3721819 Shit! We got less than a minute.
3721902 3727116 - Throw this thing away.<br />- We can't. It'll detonate. Wait a second.
3728367 3730911 I got it. Exactly two gallons in here, right?
3730995 3733497 Leaving exactly one gallon of empty space.
3733581 3737418 Five gallons here. Pour one gallon<br />out of the five gallons into there.
3737501 3740421 - We have exactly four gallons in there.<br />- Four gallons! Yes!
3741338 3742756 Come on.
3743549 3745885 Don't spill it.
3745968 3748971 - Good. Exactly four gallons.<br />- You did it, McClane.
3749054 3751932 - Put it on the thing! Get it down there!<br />- Oh, shit.
3759815 3762693 Congratulations. You're still alive.
3763152 3765154 - Huh?<br />- <i>Congratulations.</i>
3765237 3766447 Yeah, we did it.
3766530 3771035 You surprise me again, John.<br />This is becoming an ugly habit.
3771118 3776707 I don't have the time right now, Simon. Listen,<br />a deal's a deal. Where's the school bomb?
3776791 3779794 On the contrary. You have lots of time.
3779877 3785299 You have... two hours<br />and 47 minutes precisely.
3785382 3789011 Plenty of time to test those wits of yours.
3789095 3794558 Listen, jerk-off. I got a bad fuckin' hangover<br />and I'm a little sick of these fuckin' riddles!
3794642 3797520 - Now, where is the school bomb?!<br /><i>- Temper, John.</i>
3797603 3800564 The road to truth has many turns.
3800648 3804110 You will find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3804193 3808447 When you undertake the trip it suggests,<br />ask yourself this question:
3808531 3811367 what is 21 out of 42?
3814411 3816956 We're behind. We should<br />abandon the rest and go.
3817039 3820167 Relax, Targo. There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3820251 3824713 He's sending us to the home team dugout<br />at Yankee Stadium. Why?
3824797 3827258 We're the home team.<br />We find something there?
3827341 3829260 What's 21 out of 42?
3829343 3832721 21 again. Half of 42. 42 what?
3832805 3835808 - How many men on the Yankees ball club?<br />- 25.
3835891 3838978 What else is 21? Blackjack.
3839061 3842440 - It's a club.<br />- It's a wild-goose chase is what it is.
3846235 3848487 Where's the nearest A train?
3848571 3852491 Wait, wait, wait, wait. You know,<br />some kid might find that.
3854326 3856412 You're right.
3861959 3864295 You little sons of bitches!
3864378 3866964 Hey, you! I'll remember you.
3868799 3871302 Hey, where are you goin'?<br />What are you doin'?
3871385 3874555 - Lemme go, dickhead.<br />- Watch your mouth.
3874638 3877808 You'd go to juvenile hall<br />for a Butterfinger, is that it?
3877892 3880770 Look around, man.<br />All the cops are into somethin'.
3880853 3884106 It's Christmas. You could steal City Hall.
3890321 3892948 - Come on. Let's go. Come on.<br />- My bike.
3893032 3895201 - That's my bike.<br />- Yeah, it's Christmas.
3895284 3898996 - Hey, Yankee Stadium's that way.<br />- That's my bike, you asshole.
3905544 3908464 Why don't you just run over<br />everybody in the street?
3908547 3912510 - McClane, what are we doin' back down here?<br />- Let me ask you something.
3912593 3916305 - What is it that Wall Street doesn't have?<br />- You're talkin' in riddles.
3916388 3918724 - What does Wall Street not have?<br />- What?
3918808 3922019 Schools. And what is it<br />they have a shitload of?
3922103 3924230 What?
3931487 3935908 - I'll be back in a minute.<br />- What am I supposed to do with this?
3936534 3938452 Give it to those guys over there.
3938536 3941956 - He's here.<br />- Perhaps you could be a little more specific.
3942039 3946043 McClane <i>ist hier.</i><br />He's walking toward the bank.
3947294 3949922 And the black man is coming toward me.
3950005 3955219 Oh, now that's a pity. And after we've<br />gone to all that trouble at the stadium.
3955302 3957721 Simon, kill him.
3957805 3961392 Stop toying with him and kill him now.
3961475 3965438 OK, so be it. May he rest in peace.
3965521 3968983 I'll inform Karl in the lobby.
3969066 3973028 - You pack up your team and get out of there.<br />- And this one?
3973112 3975197 Officer.
3977199 3980995 I'm afraid<br />I'm gonna need an answer on that issue.
3985249 3987793 - Let him go.<br />- Understood.
3987877 3991672 - Yes, sir?<br />- John McClane says to give you this.
3993215 3995843 Wait, wait. Jesus, don't open it. It's a bomb.
3995926 3997428 - Another?<br />- Yeah.
3997511 4001223 Oh, I see. We'll take care of that.<br />We'd better move now.
4001307 4006687 Sir, thank you so much for your assistance.<br />We really appreciate it. Thank you.
4025581 4029877 Hey! You are leaving this place unguarded?
4050147 4052775 - How you doin'?<br />- All right.
4052858 4055528 John McClane. NYPD.
4055611 4057613 Are you all right?
4057696 4061117 Yeah, it's laundry day.
4061200 4063410 What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
4063494 4066413 - Has it been quiet like this all morning here?<br />- Well...
4066497 4069583 Except for that big explosion<br />a couple of hours ago.
4069667 4072795 Have you seen anything strange<br />in the last hour or so?
4072878 4077258 No. And we've had cops in here pretty steady<br />since the subway thing.
4078134 4081095 We're gonna make a round of the vault.<br />Wanna tag along?
4081178 4083806 Sure. I think I will.
4083889 4087977 - What do you think of this heat?<br />- Indian summer, huh?
4088060 4091605 Yeah, feels like it's gonna rain<br />like dogs and cats later.
4091689 4095985 Here's one of your guys.<br />Detective... Otto, isn't it?
4096068 4098154 John McClane.
4100656 4103242 Hey, Mike, how you doin'?
4104702 4108539 I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna take the stairs<br />just for the exercise,
4108622 4110666 on a hot day like this.
4110749 4114378 But it seems like<br />I always end up riding the lift.
4140821 4143616 What was the lottery number last night?
4143699 4147161 You guys play the lottery? No?
4147244 4151540 My wife buys me two tickets every week.<br />For ten years she plays the same numbers.
4151624 4156128 I say, "Why not play a different number?"<br />She goes, "Those are my lucky numbers."
4156212 4158672 I got the tickets right here.
4161509 4165387 Put that fuckin' gun down!<br />Put the fuckin' gun down now!
4171102 4173062 Put it down.
4178400 4180528 Hello?
4180611 4182822 Anybody down here?
4193040 4195126 Put your fuckin' hands up, now!
4195209 4197878 John, no, no! It's me!
4200172 4203342 - You almost gave me a heart attack.<br />- You all right?
4203426 4205970 - You all right?<br />- Yeah. It's not my blood.
4206053 4210474 - What the hell's goin' on down here?<br />- Go take a look in there.
4232037 4235708 Hey, McClane. Where the hell is everybody?
4235791 4238419 Simon fuckin' says!
4239462 4244300 I should have seen it comin'. This was never<br />about revenge. It's about a goddamn heist.
4244383 4247470 - Well, what was in the room?<br />- This.
4247553 4249430 What is this?
4249513 4251974 - Oh, shit! is this gold?<br />- Yeah, it's gold.
4252057 4253559 Damn, this is heavy.
4253642 4259356 They cleaned out a whole room of this?<br />That would have taken, like, a tank or a...
4259440 4261734 A dump truck.
4261817 4263986 14 great big dump trucks.
4264069 4266405 - We almost got hit by a dump truck.<br />- Shit.
4266489 4267990 Damn. Slow down.
4268073 4270075 - Put that shit down.<br />- No fuckin' way.
4270159 4272369 - They won't let you keep it.<br />- We'll see.
4272453 4274371 - We're gonna need a car.<br />- A car?
4280628 4284256 - Know how to hot-wire this thing?<br />- Course I can. I'm an electrician.
4284340 4286634 Only problem is...
4289887 4292056 ...it takes too fuckin' long.
4304235 4308405 - Not on the bridge.<br />- Down there, McClane. The FDR.
4311325 4313536 Let's go, let's go. Come on.
4314578 4317206 - Oh, shit.<br />- What?
4317289 4319834 - I shot the phone.<br />- Too bad.
4319917 4322670 - What's 21 out of 42?<br />- I don't have a clue.
4322753 4327174 - What about Yankee Stadium?<br />- Later. That guy is not gettin' off Manhattan.
4327258 4330469 Jesus Christ!<br />Who do you think you are? Hillary Clinton?
4330553 4333764 That's it! Hillary Clinton. The 42nd president.
4333848 4338853 - No, she'd be the 43rd president.<br />- All right, all right, but who's the 21st?
4338936 4340604 - I don't know.<br />- You don't know?
4340688 4342022 - Do you know?<br />- No.
4342106 4343649 Well...
4343732 4349280 - What engine does this piece of shit have?<br />- It's a Yugo. It's built for economy, not speed.
4351991 4355911 - What are you doin'?<br />- I'm gonna get us another phone.
4357496 4359790 Wait, wait.
4359874 4363502 - Who was the 21st president?<br />- Go fuck yourself!
4365379 4369258 - That guy was pissed.<br />- He'll feel better if he checks the back seat.
4369341 4371427 Shit, that was <i>my</i> gold bar!
4371510 4374054 This is McClane. Get me Inspector Cobb.
4374138 4377433 - John, where are you?<br /><i>- It's not a revenge. It's a heist.</i>
4377516 4378392 What?
4378476 4382855 Federal Reserve gold, they took a shitload.<br />They're headed north in dump trucks.
4382938 4386567 - Have you been drinking, McClane?<br />- No, not since this morning.
4386650 4389862 There's dump trucks<br />northbound on the FDR at about 70th.
4389945 4392615 Close the bridge<br />and get some helicopters over.
4392698 4397787 I couldn't close a hot dog stand. I'm spread<br />all over. What about this damn bomb?
4397870 4400664 Find out who the 21st president was.<br />It's connected.
4400748 4403542 - John? The 21st what?<br />- Walter?
4403626 4406670 Shit. Goddamn cellular fuckin' phones.
4406754 4411675 Tell Munson at Triborough to close all<br />the East River bridges north of 59th Street.
4411759 4413886 - Look for dump trucks.<br />- Dump trucks?
4413969 4418057 McClane says there are dump trucks<br />headed up the FDR loaded with gold.
4418140 4421102 Walter, they don't allow<br />dump trucks on the FDR.
4421185 4422394 Connie!
4422478 4426148 You don't want I should argue, I won't argue,<br />no matter how stupid it is.
4426232 4431195 Canine, check out the boiler room.<br />Did you find anything, Charlie?
4431278 4434532 I could spend a week here with<br />an x-ray machine and not find it.
4434615 4437952 You have five more minutes,<br />then we're movin' up to 86th Street.
4438035 4440329 We're goin' as fast as we can.
4440412 4441914 What's up?
4441997 4445668 McClane mentioned something about<br />the Federal Reserve building.
4445751 4449422 - Isn't that near that Wall Street bomb site?<br />- Yeah.
4455636 4457888 <i> How long do you want us to stay here?</i>
4457972 4460558 The men at the stadium. Stay or go?
4460641 4463394 - Karl should have checked in by now.<br />- <i>Moment.</i>
4472236 4474363 Come on, come on.
4475614 4479034 Stay where you are.<br />McClane may still turn up.
4479952 4486208 Relax, Targo. If he is still alive...<br />he won't be talking to anyone.
4486292 4487877 It's the next turn off.
4489170 4491380 Elvis Duran. You're on the air. What's up?
4491464 4496218 <i>First of all I wanna tell you what a great show</i><br /><i>you got. I listen to you all the time.</i>
4496302 4500806 - Thanks. What d'you wanna talk about?<br /><i>- All those cop cars screaming around.</i>
4500890 4504393 <i>You know what they're up to?</i><br /><i>There's a bomb. In a school.</i>
4504477 4506479 <i>My cousin's a cop.</i>
4506562 4509315 <i>Somebody put a big bomb</i><br /><i>in a school somewhere.</i>
4509398 4514069 <i>Only they don't know which one,</i><br /><i>so they're searching all of 'em.</i>
4514153 4517114 - Shh!<br /><i>- Every school in the metropolitan area.</i>
4517198 4519450 Holy shit.
4519533 4522661 Doris! Doris, can you get ahold of my wife?
4523370 4527750 Turley! Half the goddamn city just called 911!
4530377 4531837 They're gone.
4531921 4533380 - What?<br />- They're gone!
4533464 4535341 - Who is this guy? Houdini?<br />- Shit.
4535424 4536884 Down there, down there!
4538511 4542389 - This thing got air bags?<br />- Your side does. I don't know about mi...
4543099 4545101 McClane!
4565412 4568415 In the truck. Let me see the hands.
4568499 4571001 Put 'em on the door.
4574380 4577091 Don't kill me! Don't shoot me!
4578384 4582847 - You a truck driver?<br />- No, I'm a beautician. Of course I am!
4583889 4586767 - Where are you takin' this truck?<br />- The aqueduct.
4586851 4589603 What are you takin' it to the racetrack for?
4589687 4594191 - No, the aqueduct. The water aqueduct.<br />- "Aqueduct"?
4596527 4601031 See? It goes from here all the way<br />up to the Catskill Mountains.
4601115 4603117 - What does?<br />- That. The water pipe.
4603451 4605703 Goes for about 60 miles.
4612626 4614086 - You the foreman?<br />- Yeah.
4614170 4618716 NYPD. You had any extra dump trucks<br />come through in the last couple of minutes?
4618799 4623179 I'm gonna write those clowns up.<br />They better pay attention to work orders.
4623262 4626390 - Who?<br />- The dozen idiots who tore ass up the tube.
4626474 4629560 We're not loadin' up there any more.<br />We're loadin' here.
4629643 4632062 So much for bridges and helicopters.
4632146 4636275 - Got a map to show where this tunnel goes?<br />- Yeah, right here.
4637693 4641447 We run up under the Saw Mill<br />until you get up to the cofferdam.
4641530 4644492 From there on we've already<br />brought the water down.
4644575 4648913 - Any way to get in or out of there?<br />- There's a vent shaft every two miles.
4648996 4651957 - No, I mean with a truck.<br />- At the cofferdam you can.
4652041 4656462 You can get there on the surface. Follow<br />Saw Mill River Parkway. It's about 20 miles.
4656545 4658464 I'm gonna meet you there, all right?
4658547 4662093 - What am I supposed to do?<br />- Go up to Yankee Stadium.
4662593 4665387 - McClane!<br />- Go. We got less than two hours.
4665471 4667306 Goddammit.
4672645 4675523 Hey! Somethin' wrong?
4675606 4679527 480 yards of rock moved so far.<br />Now, that's ten times the Hoover Dam.
4679610 4683697 Right now there's 516 feet<br />of rock above our heads.
4683781 4686575 This part is phase three of tunnel three.
4686659 4692540 Planning for it began back in 1954, but<br />construction didn't begin till June of 1970.
4692623 4695251 You know the most interesting<br />part of this tunnel?
4695334 4697962 - What's that, Jerry?<br />- The valves. Each one...
4704677 4708431 ...big departure from tunnels one and two.
4708514 4710891 Come on.
4710975 4715771 - What a helluva place to break down.<br />- Hold it, Jerry. Let me have your hard hat.
4715855 4718649 - You got ajacket?<br />- Yeah, yeah. Here.
4718732 4720192 Wait here a minute.
4720943 4723571 Wait until he gets alongside the door.
4723654 4727074 Fellas? Mickey O'Brien, aqueduct security.
4727158 4731579 We had a report of a guy comin'<br />through here with eight reindeer.
4738002 4742757 They said he was ajolly old fat guy<br />with a snowy white beard.
4742840 4747595 Cute little red and white suit.<br />I'm surprised you didn't see him.
4749138 4752516 What is it with you guys and these phones?
4752600 4755394 Maybe this'll give me somethin'.
4755478 4758606 Holy shit. Is that guy dead?
4758689 4761233 Yes, Jerry. I'm afraid he is.
4761317 4763903 - Jesus Christ.<br />- Yeah.
4763986 4768532 I want you to get ahold of a guy named Cobb.<br />Walter Cobb, C-o-b-b.
4768616 4771494 He's the head of my police unit.<br />Get him down here.
4771577 4776165 Tell him you were with John McClane. Tell<br />him to find out who the 21st president was.
4776248 4778501 Chester A Arthur.
4778584 4780461 - What?<br />- Chester A Arthur.
4780544 4784632 1881 to 1885.<br />Nominated vice president in 1880.
4784715 4787802 Did you know he was<br />collector of customs in New York?
4787885 4790137 No, I didn't know that, Jerry.
4790221 4792348 Take care of yourself.
4856120 4860791 - TV's got us. We gotta release Traffic.<br />- No. Traffic jams we can clear later.
4860875 4863669 What is wrong with this thing?<br />What about Ricky?
4863753 4866922 I can't get ahold of him.<br />But, Walter, Federal Reserve...
4867006 4870134 - Yeah?<br />- Biggest gold storage in the world.
4872178 4875639 You get a unit back there. Find Ricky.<br />Find out what is goin' on.
4875723 4879059 Walter! You gotta hear this.
4883105 4888152 - I thought we were going in the back way.<br />- This is the back way, Walter.
4888235 4892448 In half an hour you're gonna have a riot<br />at every school in the city.
4897912 4900498 Start at the top floor.<br />Put 20 men on each floor.
4900581 4903000 Send the other 50<br />down to the basement with us.
4903084 4907213 - What about McClane?<br />- I'm gettin' nothing. Busy signal.
4907296 4909715 This is puttin' all our eggs in one basket.
4909799 4912426 - I mean, what if McClane's wrong?<br />- Walter!
4912510 4914887 This is Principal Martinez. Inspector Cobb.
4914970 4917056 - How do you do?<br />- How do you do?
4917139 4922019 I don't wanna alarm the children. Please move<br />them to the auditorium and keep them calm.
4940538 4943791 We are coming to the dam.<br />You can call the rearguard.
4949088 4951841 Rearguard, you can close up now.
4952967 4957096 We've reached the dam.<br />You can come up now.
4957179 4960015 Nils, you can close in now.
4961058 4964603 - Nils?<br />- Attention, attention. Nils is dead.
4964687 4968190 <i>I repeat- Nils is dead, fuckhead. So is his pal.</i>
4968274 4972528 <i>And those four guys from the East German</i><br /><i>All-Stars, your boys down at the bank?</i>
4972611 4974572 They're gonna be a little late.
4974655 4976365 John.
4977408 4982997 In the back of the truck you're driving<br />there's 13 billion dollars in gold bullion.
4983080 4986542 - Would a deal be out of the question?<br /><i>- Yeah, I got a deal for ya.</i>
4986625 4991464 Crawl out from under that rock you're hiding<br />under and I'll drive this truck up your ass.
4991547 4992965 How colourful.
4999096 5001223 I told you not to toy with him!
5001307 5004018 Thank you. That's very helpful.
5006645 5009774 You have jeopardised the mission<br />and the contract.
5012026 5018157 We're vulnerable till we've reached the ship.<br />I'm going to put an end to this.
5018240 5019575 Stop!
5022620 5024705 Targo! Targo!
5024789 5027083 Here. Come here!
5028209 5030294 - We blow the dam.<br />- What?
5030377 5031921 We drown him.
5038803 5041889 Yanni, get that up there.
5043933 5045226 Walter!
5045309 5051273 Look at this. The janitor said this one was<br />delivered this morning. About 10:30, right?
5051357 5053067 - Not hooked up.<br />- Yeah?
5053150 5055986 OK, now take a look at the front.
5058447 5060658 We drill the hinges. Get everybody out.
5195042 5196419 Agh!
5211600 5213686 McClane!
5215563 5217231 - McClane!<br />- Where are you?
5217314 5218774 Over here.
5218858 5222486 You got a helluva way of flaggin'<br />somebody down. You all right?
5222570 5225281 - Did you go to Yankee Stadium?<br />- Yeah. Nobody there.
5225364 5228742 You didn't see nobody?<br />Nobody was followin' you?
5228826 5232538 I'm tellin' you, he's jerkin' us around.
5232621 5235791 - Come on.<br />- "I didn't see nobody. Nobody followed..."
5235875 5238169 Go! Go! Go!
5242298 5244884 It's not rigged. Pull it.
5256187 5260149 Well, I'd say you could call off your search.
5260232 5262902 - Can you stop it?<br />- I shouldn't even touch it.
5262985 5267072 Who knows what kind of booby traps<br />this thing's got? What about the code?
5267156 5269950 - No word.<br />- When do we evacuate?
5270034 5273954 - Simon says he sees one kid leave, boom.<br />- So maybe somebody's watchin'.
5274038 5278667 But we can't stand here with our thumb<br />up our ass waitin' for this thing to blow up!
5285216 5288385 - Shit! Shit!<br />- Keep your head down!
5288469 5290137 Hold it steady!
5295351 5298270 - Outta the way!<br />- Go around him!
5311033 5313369 - I found out who's the 21st president.<br />- Who?
5313452 5316580 - Some guy named Arthur.<br />- Chester A Arthur?
5316664 5319625 - That's it.<br />- Chester A Arthur Elementary School?
5344400 5349572 Hi, kids. I know you usually have<br />assembly on Fridays, but today's special.
5349655 5352324 Mr Lambert here is from the fire department,
5352408 5356245 and today he wants us to practise<br />a brand-new fire drill.
5356328 5361250 So I want you to divide in half. Half of you<br />go over here - teachers will help them -
5361333 5363544 and line up against the wall.
5363627 5369425 The other half will go this way.<br />Please do it very quietly and very quickly.
5369508 5372094 Everybody up, please. Teachers, help them.
5372178 5375598 Fire drill, my ass.<br />That guy ain't from the fire department.
5375681 5380728 - Maybe it's because of the radio.<br />- You mean, like, they're after us? Nah.
5380811 5383939 - Tony squealed on us.<br />- No, he didn't.
5384023 5387693 - Come on.<br />- Where you goin'?
5390362 5394492 - Let me drive! Let me drive!<br />- Go ahead. Goddammit.
5396410 5399246 Why didn't you say?<br />Of course he put the bomb in that school.
5399330 5402249 - Why would he do that?<br />- To get your complete attention.
5407838 5410841 Find the fuse panel.<br />Where's the fuse panel?
5410925 5413344 - Here.<br />- Pull out the antilock brake fuse.
5413427 5417640 - Shit, I don't know which it is.<br />- Yank 'em all out, then.
5417723 5421685 Put your head down. Put it down,<br />This is gonna be really bad.
5421769 5424897 Listen to me. Hang the fuck on, all right?
5451132 5454635 What the fuck happened?
5454718 5456137 You got a Triple A card?
5456220 5458639 Keep moving. Keep moving.
5458722 5461392 I've got the janitors making a last sweep now.
5461475 5463102 Thank you, Miss Martinez.
5480327 5482329 Come on.
5483080 5485708 Five-card stud, threes and nines are wild.
5486041 5488127 Stay down! Stay low!
5497178 5499054 Oh, man.
5502016 5504059 - What are you doin'?<br />- Interrogating him.
5504143 5508022 - What's he gonna tell you? "I'm dead"?<br />- I ain't gonna know till I ask him.
5508105 5512401 Go around and see<br />if there's any aspirins in that glove box.
5512485 5514862 No way. You do it.
5520201 5525331 Ten quarters. The guy in the dump truck<br />had ten quarters. Exactly ten quarters.
5525414 5528292 Maybe they were makin'<br />long-distance phone calls.
5528375 5530377 No.
5530461 5533506 It's for the bridge.<br />It's for the toll on the bridge.
5535508 5539845 There! Down on the wharf!<br />Dump trucks. Right there.
5542640 5545726 Christ, they got it loaded on a ship already.
5546769 5547812 Shit.
5547895 5551315 - How about the Coast Guard?<br />- It'd take 'em an hour to get here.
5551398 5553526 Shit.
5553609 5556654 - We can jump.<br />- What? You're outta your fuckin' mind.
5556737 5559615 - It's 100 feet down to the deck.<br />- But not to the crane.
5559698 5562952 The cables would cut you in half.
5563035 5564745 - I can make it.<br />- Bullshit.
5564829 5567915 Get down. Look in the back of that car<br />for some gloves.
5570835 5574046 Six booby traps, four dead ends,
5574130 5576966 and a partridge in a pear tree.
5581220 5583764 OK, honey.
5583848 5585433 Let's dance.
5585516 5589228 We're gonna have a race. So when I say go,<br />I want you all to run like crazy.
5589311 5593691 Follow the police officer and the fireman.<br />You guys are my front runners.
5593774 5596068 Walter. Think we're cuttin' this thin?
5596152 5599822 No, Joe, we're gonna wait.<br />McClane still may get the code.
5602074 5605411 - Line me up with that crane.<br />- There. Right there.
5605494 5607872 - Right there. You're OK.<br />- I see it now.
5608831 5612460 - This'll take a miracle.<br />- Keep your fingers crossed. Swing it.
5614128 5615796 You almost got it. Almost...
5615880 5617673 Yeah! All right.
5617757 5621302 - Where you goin'? You in a hurry?<br />- I'm goin' first this time.
5622678 5625598 We have the intercom rigged, sir.
5625681 5629894 <i>The kids may be fine, but you wait much</i><br /><i>longer and I'm gonna pee in my pants.</i>
5629977 5632813 We're gonna wait, Connie.
5632897 5635316 Six more minutes.
5649497 5651499 McClane. Down there.
5661926 5665096 Shit. Go, man, go.
5674522 5676148 Aaaagh!
5685032 5686700 Aaagh!
5690871 5692915 Oh, boy.
5693958 5696419 Am I glad you talked me outtajumpin'.
5724947 5727199 Get his feet.
5766572 5771160 We find Simon, drag him to the ship-to-shore<br />radio and beat that code out of him.
5771243 5772870 Here. Take this.
5772953 5775081 - How does it work?<br />- You can't shoot a gun?
5775164 5778000 All brothers don't know<br />how to shoot guns, you racist.
5778084 5781754 Sue me. Just yank back on that<br />and pull the trigger.
5781837 5783631 - That's it.<br />- That's it?
5783714 5785925 Just don't shoot yourself.
5786008 5789178 Hey, don't be no hero.<br />You find him, you come get me.
5807071 5810074 Hey, Katya! <i>Was ist mit dem Essen?</i><br /><i>Ich will heut noch was haben.</i>
5819708 5823087 <i>- Irgendwann geht's wohl los, nicht?</i><br /><i>- Wann gibt's denn was zu essen?</i>
5849572 5852158 <i> Eins, neun, sieben...</i>
5852241 5857121 <i>Dreiundzwanzig Meilen...</i><br /><i>Drei, vier, vierzig Meilen.</i>
5860833 5863711 - You have the autopilot set?<br />- Yes, sir.
5863794 5865796 Good.
5870176 5872762 Don't fuckin' move.
5877892 5881562 - Oh. The Samaritan.<br />- Gimme the goddamn code.
5881645 5884690 Code? Oh!
5884774 5888319 You mean, for the school?<br />I'm sorry, I can't do that.
5888402 5894366 You call in that code right now,<br />or I'll blow your sick ass into the next world.
5895451 5898370 If that's what you gotta do.
5910091 5912468 You got to take the safety catch off.
5912551 5913803 Goddamn!
5913886 5917223 See, that works. Now, where's McClane?
5934573 5936575 What was that?
5940413 5942415 He said, "Don't shoot".
5942748 5946627 <i> OK, Charlie. We're gonna</i><br /><i>have to go with the evacuation.</i>
5946710 5949505 - We're gonna go.<br />- You heard the man. Let's go!
5949588 5951298 We're gonna go.
5951382 5955219 On my mark. Five, four, three, two, one.
5955302 5957138 Go! Go, go, go, go!
5959682 5963269 Let's do it.<br />OK, gang. Let's go!
5963352 5966147 Go, go, go! Hip-hop, hip-hop.<br />Come on, everybody.
5966230 5969483 Let's go. Run, run, run, run. We're gonna win!
5969567 5971652 Go, go, go, go, go!
5972278 5974113 Keep movin'. On your left.
5986208 5988753 What are they doin'?
5988836 5991046 Hey, where you goin'?
5992548 5996844 I see you all day, little man. Policeman.
5998304 6000931 And you don't go away.
6001015 6004268 Yeah, I'm that fuckin' Energizer Bunny.
6005770 6008272 Where are you going now, eh?
6010524 6013652 Going to arrest me, Bunny?
6015946 6018741 I don't think I'm gonna arrest you.
6018824 6020910 I'm gonna fuckin'...
6031462 6035674 - I knew it was bullshit. Nobody's watching.<br />- Time to get Charlie out.
6035758 6037760 Let's move, Charles. Time's up.
6037843 6041430 - Give me another 30 seconds.<br /><i>- It takes a minute 15 if you're a kid.</i>
6041514 6044058 And you're not too light on your feet.<br />Now move!
6045184 6047770 - Up here!<br />- Oh, my God.
6049980 6054151 - Christ, get 'em out of there!<br />- The rooms are locked!
6055069 6058739 Hey! Any one marked "4".
6059782 6064995 - What's goin' on, Walter?<br /><i>- We still have kids in the building.</i>
6069125 6072753 - I'm stayin'.<br /><i>- No, Charlie, get outta there.</i>
6074004 6076882 You ever see that show called<br /><i>The Addams Family</i>?
6076966 6079718 They got a motherfucker on there<br />called Lurch.
6079802 6083472 You don't think I'm gonna let you<br />get to that gun, do you?
6086892 6088853 Fuck.
6109623 6113210 4... 4... Fuck it!<br />Get out of the way!
6124221 6126974 - Where are they, Walter?<br /><i>- Still in.</i>
6133397 6135816 No guts, no glory.
6138569 6141781 If we get to the roof<br />we can jump to the next building.
6141864 6144408 - Shit!<br />- Out of the way.
6145117 6147286 OK, come on.
6148621 6150790 Get 'em up here. Come on.
6150873 6154752 Mayday. Mayday.<br />Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.
6168182 6170267 Come on, kids.
6174271 6176565 Shit, it's too far.
6183489 6184949 No guts, no glory.
6185908 6188119 It's a big black-and-white fuckin' boat.
6188202 6190704 <i>- Please stay on the line.</i><br />- Yeah, sure.
6209056 6210933 Pancake syrup?
6211267 6213602 Stupid, stupid.
6213686 6216230 Asshole.
6216313 6218232 Hello, John McClane.
6219567 6222153 There was never any bomb<br />in the school, was there?
6222236 6224321 Of course not.
6224405 6226782 I'm a soldier, not a monster.
6226866 6230077 Even though I sometimes work for monsters.
6230161 6233080 No, the real bomb is on this ship.
6237501 6239920 Coast Guard.
6240004 6243424 I was telling 'em where the boat was.
6243507 6247303 - Game over, huh?<br />- Not quite over.
6248471 6251724 Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in, please.
6251807 6254560 They put you on hold?
6254643 6257313 She told me to stay on the line.
6260941 6265529 - Oh, God, I love this country.<br />- Your brother was an asshole.
6266989 6271786 - He really was an asshole.<br />- He was an asshole. You got his number.
6275414 6279210 Forgive me.<br />Would you help Mr McClane below?
6280544 6282838 Careful now.
6284006 6287676 Now, do you have the communiqu�?
6287760 6290638 - Bridgeport radio, come in, please.<br /><i>- Coast Guard.</i>
6290721 6292515 - Oh, you're there, dear.<br />- <i>Yes.</i>
6292598 6296060 - Have you the ability to record a message?<br />- <i>Yes.</i>
6296143 6298354 - Then please begin now.<br />- <i>Right.</i>
6304401 6307113 <i> This is a communiqu� from the CRF.</i>
6307196 6311075 <i>For too long the West has conspired</i><br /><i>to steal the wealth of the world,</i>
6311158 6314829 <i>consigning the balance of humanity</i><br /><i>to economic starvation.</i>
6314912 6317873 <i>Today we will level the playing field.</i>
6317957 6321210 <i>In a few minutes the contents</i><br /><i>of the Federal Reserve Bank,</i>
6321293 6324130 <i>the gold your economies are built on,</i>
6324213 6329218 <i>will be redistributed by explosive</i><br /><i>across the bottom of the Long Island Sound.</i>
6330761 6335433 <i>If you are not in gridlock,</i><br /><i>I invite you to come and watch.</i>
6339145 6342356 - You're gonna blow it all up?<br />- That's the idea.
6342440 6347153 There are some gentlemen in the Middle East<br />who think they'll make a great deal of money.
6347236 6351866 See the men safely off the ship<br />and I'll see you in the port-side launch.
6351949 6356078 What the hell's all this<br />got to do with killin' McClane?
6356162 6358581 Life has its little bonuses.
6358664 6360958 You said you didn't even like your brother.
6361041 6363377 There's a difference between not liking him
6363461 6366964 and not caring when some Irish flatfoot<br />drops him out of a window.
6367047 6371510 - I didn't even know that motherfucker!<br />- And I never invited you aboard this ship.
6371594 6376223 - No riddle's gonna stop this motherfucker?<br />- No code, no riddle, no fancy countdown.
6376307 6378309 Hey, fuckhead.
6378392 6380019 Yeah, you, fuckhead.
6381437 6384231 There's just one thing I gotta know.
6384940 6389945 You got any aspirins?<br />I've had a bad fuckin' headache all day long.
6392865 6395868 Must be your lucky day.
6395951 6398579 Keep the bottle.<br />Run.
6409840 6413135 Where is the gold?
6414261 6420184 He's betrayed us.<br />The containers are filled with that.
6441956 6444458 <i>Warten Sie. Jetzt.</i>
6447503 6451549 <i>- Los geht's. Aber schnell.</i><br /><i>- Volle Fahrt voraus.</i>
6451882 6456554 If I hadn't saved your ass I wouldn't be<br />about to blow up with $100 billion of gold.
6456637 6459140 I got bad news.<br />You're only gonna blow up with me.
6459223 6461100 - What?<br />- There's no gold.
6461183 6464019 - How d'you know?<br />- I know the man, I know the family.
6464103 6468983 The only thing better than blowin' up<br />all that gold is makin' people think he did.
6469066 6472445 - Where is it?<br />- I don't know. Back at the docks somewhere.
6472528 6477450 - Is that supposed to make me feel better?<br />- No. But you're wrong, you're not gonna die.
6477533 6483497 - You know some cop trick about handcuffs?<br />- Yeah, use a key.
6483581 6486041 - Can you pick this lock?<br />- Is this black shit?
6486125 6488753 Stop that racial shit.<br />Are you a locksmith or not?
6488836 6491255 I could do it if I had somethin' to do it with.
6491338 6495509 - Like a splinter of that cable I slid down?<br />- That might work.
6497553 6500681 - Hold on.<br />- What the fuck are you doin'?
6503684 6505686 Fuck! Shit!
6505770 6509190 - How's that? That big enough?<br />- Yeah. That might work.
6509273 6512568 All right. I'm gonna drop it in your hands.<br />Cup your hands.
6512651 6515446 - Don't drop this motherfucker.<br />- I'm gettin' right.
6515529 6519784 - You ready? Ready?<br />- One, two... Spit it.
6519867 6520993 Yeah!
6521077 6523370 - You get it?<br />- Come on, move your hands.
6526040 6530211 - Damn. I was just startin' to like you.<br />- Yeah, well, don't. I'm an asshole.
6530294 6532296 What are you talkin' about now?
6532379 6535216 - I lied to you, Zeus.<br />- About what?
6535299 6540638 You remember I said Weiss found that bomb<br />up in Harlem? They found it in Chinatown.
6540721 6543182 That's low. Even for a white fucker like you.
6543265 6545768 I told you I was an asshole.
6545851 6548145 What the fuck was that?
6548229 6550689 I don't know.
6550773 6553859 It was the only way<br />I could get you to come with me.
6553943 6555945 - You got a wife, McClane?<br />- Yeah.
6556028 6558614 I'm surprised anybody<br />stayed with you that long.
6558697 6561492 She didn't stick around.<br />We're sort of separated.
6561575 6566288 - What the fuck is "sort of separated"?<br />- Well, she was in LA, I was in New York.
6566372 6570042 We had a fight on the phone, she hung up...<br />I didn't call her back.
6570126 6572420 How long ago was that?
6572503 6575631 - About a year ago now.<br />- About a year?
6577258 6580052 What the fuck are you laughin' about?
6580136 6583931 You threw away your marriage cos<br />you were too stupid to pick up the phone?
6584014 6588227 - You think that's funny?<br />- I bet you blame that shit on your wife, too.
6588310 6590604 My wife is a very stubborn woman, yes.
6593441 6596777 - Stop fuckin' laughin' and undo these cuffs!<br />- I'm almost...
6596861 6600114 There. How's that for concentration?
6600197 6603576 - Oh, shit. Fuck. I dropped the thing.<br />- You dropped it?
6603659 6605244 Goddammit.
6605327 6607455 - Shit. Where'd it go?<br />- Just find it.
6607538 6610624 I don't fuckin' see it.
6610708 6613210 <i>- </i><br />- What the fuck is that?
6614420 6617006 I think I made it mad.
6617590 6619925 - Get outta here.<br />- Gotta do somethin'.
6620009 6623596 Goddammit, McClane, listen to me!
6623679 6626098 Just go.
6626182 6630686 I've had a hard enough day without your<br />death on my conscience. Shut up and think.
6630770 6635191 - Tools. Check the engine room.<br />- There's no time!
6635274 6638986 - What the hell's it doin' now?<br />- It's mixing. Shit!
6640446 6644325 - What the hell are you doin'?<br />- Get ready. Lean forward, goddammit.
6647119 6650331 - It's gonna go fast. Lean forward.<br />- Oh, no.
6650414 6652750 Get ready. Move your hands.
6653375 6655795 - Fuckin' shit!<br />- Come on, let's go.
6655878 6657630 Goddamn. Goddamn!
6657713 6660758 - Come on!<br />- Oh, fuck, my leg.
6660841 6661926 Agh!
6662009 6664845 Get upstairs. Come on, go, go, go, go!
6664929 6666388 Go! Get upstairs.
6667389 6669809 Oh, shit. Goddammit, my foot.
6669892 6673604 Let's go. Down here,<br />to the back of the boat. Come on.
6673687 6676607 - Run, goddammit!<br />- I am.
6676690 6680027 All right? Watch it. Down here at the back.
6709140 6710599 How's he doin'?
6710683 6713227 I got shot in the leg. How you think I'm doin'?
6713310 6715438 He's gonna be just fine.
6715521 6719400 - How 'bout you?<br />- I'm all right. Did you get Ricky outta there?
6721277 6723362 Yeah, they found him.
6724572 6727450 - Are you gonna be all right?<br />- I got a bad headache.
6727533 6730661 - Think they're mad at me?<br />- I wouldn't worry about them.
6730745 6734331 They'll get to you, but they're busy<br />with this salvage operation.
6734415 6737710 No. Dredges. Dredges.
6737793 6739879 There's no gold out there.
6739962 6743507 - What do you mean?<br />- He took it with him. He beat me.
6743591 6746343 - He beat all of us.<br />- He wasn't playing against you.
6746427 6750931 Fuck that, McClane.<br />You're still alive, aren't you?
6751557 6754310 - Well, aren't you?<br />- Yeah.
6754393 6756437 So he lost.
6756520 6759815 Lambert, would you give him a quarter?
6759899 6761525 Asshole.
6765905 6768491 Yeah, it's collect. From John.
6775539 6778584 Carmen? Just tell him<br />you'll accept the charges.
6778667 6781045 Son of a bitch had aspirin.
6781670 6785091 Yeah, it's John.<br />I'm hanging in there. Is Holly there?
6785174 6787259 I'll hold on.
6803025 6804568 Zeus, hold on!
6804652 6807029 <i>John? John?</i>

6981203 6984457 Whoa-ho!<br />I think she's pissed at you, McClane.
7005186 7007605 He's under us right now.<br />Come on back around.
7007688 7011400 - What's out your side?<br />- Look like roaches with the lights comin' on.
7013986 7017740 - Are we going to Nova Scotia?<br />- You go with the trucks.
7017823 7020951 I have something personal to finish.
7022995 7025164 Let's go to work.
7038344 7041806 That's right. Run, motherfuckers!<br />The exterminators are here.
7041889 7043390 Whoo!
7053359 7054860 What the fuck...?
7054944 7059073 - Oh, shit. There's smoke back here.<br />- We got a chopper behind us.
7059156 7062118 You got a gun on board? What is this?
7065413 7068749 I can't see a goddamn thing. Hold it still.
7072628 7073712 Oh, shit!
7073796 7076715 - Oh, shit.<br />- What do you mean, "Oh, shit"?
7078884 7082721 - All right, hang on. We're goin' down.<br />- See those high-tension wires?
7082805 7085349 Hey, McClane. What the fuck...?
7087268 7090771 Hey, we got smoke. We got fuckin' smoke<br />and shit flyin' on me here!
7093566 7095609 - Truck!<br />- Hold on. Here we go.
7101949 7105786 We gotta get out of here. They're<br />gonna start shootin' at us any second.
7105870 7107246 Get him out.
7107329 7112126 - The belt's stuck. I can't get it off.<br />- Look out. Here he comes.
7113210 7116213 - I can't get out, McClane.<br />- Get him outta here.
7116297 7119550 - Where you goin'?<br />- To try and get his attention.
7138486 7140154 Shit.
7140237 7143240 This keeps gettin' better and better.
7147703 7151290 I had no idea Canada could be this much fun.
7156378 7159924 Just give me somethin' to shoot at.<br />Come on, one shot.
7160007 7162593 Show me that smilin' face.
7183656 7185658 Say hello to your brother.

7211809 7215146 - Looks like you got his attention.<br />- Yeah, looks like it.
7217606 7222069 - Think we should call a fire truck?<br />- Fuck him. Let him cook.
7223612 7225865 - Oh, shit.<br />- What?
7226907 7228284 What?
7228367 7231912 - I left Holly hangin' on hold.<br />- Call her back.
7232955 7237710 - I don't know. She's gonna be pissed.<br />- She'll get over it.
7238294 7240546 I don't know, Zeus.
7241380 7245801 Like I said, she's a very stubborn woman.
7245885 7249388 Yeah, she'd have to be<br />to stay married to you.
