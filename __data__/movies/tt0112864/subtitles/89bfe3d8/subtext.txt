818151 820153 It's a textbook megalomania.

823281 825325 Or omnipotence predominate.
825408 828911 He wants control over him— over his<br />actions, his thoughts, even his emotions.
828995 830788 Sounds like you got<br />a secret admirer, John.
830872 832999 Yeah, maybe he'll<br />send me some flowers.
833082 836294 - Everybody knows you like pansies.<br />- It's not that kind of emotion.
836377 838713 - This guy is ugly.<br />- How is that?
838796 841632 Nothing wrong with him<br />a shower wouldn't cure.

847764 852352 - This is Fred Schiller, John. He's a—<br />- A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
852435 855772 Yes, I was saying that we're dealing<br />with a megalomaniacal personality...
855855 857774 with possible<br />paranoid schizophrenia.
857857 860109 Hey, how about we just<br />skip down to the part...
860193 862171 where you tell me what the fuck<br />this has to do with me, huh?
862195 866282 I don't know. I mean, what I do know is<br />it does have specifically to do with you.
866366 868868 This guy wants to pound<br />on you till you crumble.
868951 872955 - He wants you to dance to his tune, and then—<br />- Put on a dress and fuck me?
873039 877210 - I was going to say kill you.
877293 880171 He's sitting on<br />an awful lot of rage...
880254 883549 and it could be manifested physically<br />if he's stressed.
883633 886094 Someone he arrested?<br />Somebody he pissed off?
886177 889305 - That could be one hell of a long list.<br />- Fuck you, Joe.
889389 892016 See, these people don't<br />like to work anonymously.
892100 894352 They want you to know<br />who's doing it to you.

1082873 1084875 Not enough time, Inspector.
1084959 1087169 You better hope he calls back.
1087253 1089880 - He will.
1089964 1094093 Ricky, you wanna tell those people<br />to shut the hell up out there?
1094176 1097138 Hey, keep it down here!
1097221 1100182 [ Chattering Stops I
1105146 1108608 Simon, he wasn't speaking<br />for all of us.
1108691 1111777 That was unpleasant.<br />Don't let it happen again.
1111861 1114071 So, what's your name, boy?
1114155 1116365 - Don't call me boy.<br />- I'm sorry.
1116449 1119035 It was a poor attempt at humor.
1119118 1121203 I was going to send<br />you home with a chiding...
1121287 1123807 - but now I think perhaps you should join the game.<br />- We got him!
1123831 1126042 It's a pay phone in Oslo.
1126125 1128353 - [Connie I No, wait, they say it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Norway?
1128377 1131756 - Wait. Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Forget it!
1131839 1134800 Australia? He's scrambling up their system.<br />They don't know where he is.
1134884 1138012 Having fun with<br />the phone company, are we?
1138095 1140723 Simon says,<br />McClane and the Samaritan...
1140806 1143893 will go to the subway station<br />at 72nd and Broadway.
1143976 1147396 I will call you in 15 minutes on<br />the pay phone outside the station.
1147480 1151067 No police. Failure to answer<br />will constitute noncompliance.

1153611 1156739 Oh, yes, I understand. I understand<br />that you're a fuckin' wacko...
1156822 1159158 that likes to play kids' games,<br />that's what I understand.
1159241 1161202 - Hardly.<br />- “Hardly”?
1161285 1164622 Well, then, who are you?<br />Somebody I sent up? What'd you do?
1164705 1167124 Shoplifting? Purse snatching?
1167208 1169168 Cross-dressing? What?
1169251 1173381 You c-c-couldn't catch me if I stole<br />your ch-ch-chair with you in it.
1173464 1176717 My ch-ch-chair with me in it?<br />Ooh-hoo! That's very exciting.
1176801 1179136 Let me ask you a question,<br />bonehead.
1179220 1181555 Why are you trying to k-k-k-k-kill me?

1183683 1186745 Why don't you come on down here and<br />we'll figure this out like a couple of men?
1186769 1188688 - Just come on down here.
1188771 1191565 - If killing you was all I wanted,<br />you'd be dead by now.<br />- Simon.
1191649 1195361 This is Inspector Cobb. I can appreciate<br />your feelings for McClane...
1195444 1198114 but believe me,<br />the jerk isn't worth it.
1198197 1199739 He stepped on so many toes<br />in this department...
1199740 1200658 He stepped on so many toes<br />in this department...
1200741 1203369 by this time next month<br />he's going to be a security guard.
1203452 1205663 His own wife wants nothing<br />to do with him...
1205746 1208833 and he's about two steps shy<br />of becoming a full-blown alcoholic.
1208916 1211335 One step. One step!
1211419 1213629 Now listen to me.
1213713 1217383 You sound like a real smart guy.<br />What is it that you want?

1225266 1228894 Now what would it take just to forget him<br />and live happily ever after?
1228978 1231063 You know, money is shit to me.

1254754 1257214 He couldn't be any clearer<br />if he got it from a case history.
1257298 1260509 He gave you clues to his identity.<br />He spoke German.
1260593 1264597 He called it “your Fort Knox.”<br />And he stammered when McClane pushed him.
1264680 1267600 Now, you believe this<br />guy really can't be bought?
1267683 1271562 There's no chance. The very mention<br />of money only enraged him further.
1278778 1281864 - What's that?<br />- It's your shield.
1281947 1284950 - You asking me to be a cop again, Walter?<br />- Ricky, get him his gun.

1483148 1486986 Every wife had seven sacks. Every sack had<br />seven cats. Every cat had seven kittens.
1487069 1490155 Kittens, cats, sacks and wives.<br />How many were going to St. Ives?

1507756 1510235 Shut the fuck up, McClane!<br />He said seven wives with seven sacks.
1510259 1514179 - Seven times seven is 49. Now tell me the rest.<br />- Uh, a sack with seven...
1514263 1516241 - Weren't you listening?<br />- Yeah! I didn't hear every fuckin'...
1516265 1518660 - What is wrong with you?<br />- Besides having a bad fucking<br />hangover, for one thing!
1518684 1520519 All right, all right!
1520602 1524440 Seven wives times seven, 49. With seven<br />cats. Seven times 49 is... 343, right?
1524523 1526459 - Are you asking me or telling me?<br />- I'm telling you.
1526483 1530320 343 times seven is—<br />One, zero, 24.2,401!
1530404 1532948 - That's what you got, right?<br />- Yeah, that's what I got.
1533032 1535034 - Is that it, 2,401?<br />- That's it. Dial.

1541957 1545085 - I forgot about the man.<br />- What man? Fuck the man! We got 10 seconds!
1545169 1547421 He said, how many were going<br />to St. Ives, right?
1547504 1551508 The riddle begins: As I was going to<br />St. Ives, I met a man with seven wives.

1628752 1632131 - I left something<br />provocative on that train, John.

1655904 1658157 It could be double that.

1694651 1696778 I told you Ninth Avenue<br />was the quickest way south!
1696862 1699406 Stop with that goddamn yelling!<br />I know what I'm doing!

1701158 1703827 They're headed east on 72nd<br />towards the park.
1703911 1707122 - But Wall Street is south!<br />- Man, stop yelling at me! I got a bad headache.
1707206 1710250 And the best way south is not Ninth Avenue.<br />It's through the park.
1712544 1716924 Oh, dear. I told you that<br />Park Drive is always jammed.
1717007 1721136 - I didn't say Park Drive.

1940730 1942750 - You're not gonna get on that train—<br />- I'm gonna get on that train!
1942774 1944752 - You gotta get to that pay phone by 10:20!<br />- What are you gonna do?

2673171 2676299 Simon says, if you attempt<br />to evacuate schools...
2676382 2678301 the bomb will be detonated<br />by radio.
2678384 2680553 And, gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.
2680636 2685016 Repeat, one school will be dismissed<br />at 3:00 p.m. permanently, unless...
2685099 2687018 Unless what?

2708122 2711209 we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.
2711292 2715963 The only problem is the darn things seem to<br />respond to police and F.B.I. frequencies.

3198362 3201532 - It's played hell with our alarms, I'm afraid.<br />- I trust there's nothing wrong.
3201615 3204493 Oh, no. Good Lord, no.<br />Safe and secure.
3204576 3207538 Now, you were concerned<br />about a currency exchange?
3207621 3210833 We are not a commercial bank,<br />in the normal sense.
3210916 3213627 We're— We're primarily, uh...
3213711 3216255 governments, central banks,<br />that sort of thing.
3216338 3220050 - Apart from the depository, of course.<br />- Of course.
3220134 3222803 And you are in the flower business,<br />Mr. Vanderfloog?
3226598 3228767 Back! Back! Come on!
3252166 3254501 Come on!
3268640 3271518 Oh, no, Mr. Vanderfloog,<br />that's the vault elevator.
3273145 3276565 I'm sorry.<br />Our alarms are sonic and seismic.
3276648 3279193 Two things which, I'm afraid,<br />do not react well to explosions.
3279276 3283238 You know, this subway business has<br />knocked all our systems into a cocked hat.
3283322 3286408 In fact, we've had to give up<br />and pull the plug on the whole thing.
3286492 3288410 The repair people<br />are downstairs now.
3288494 3290454 - Good Lord!<br />- Yes, yes.
3290537 3293707 - Heavens to Betsy if anyone knew!
3296293 3300464 - But... I thought this<br />was a currency exchange.
3300547 3303967 Oh, I think we'll go<br />straight to the withdrawal.
3304051 3307304 [ Gun Hisses I
3307387 3310057 Danke.
3352182 3354852 Hey, Captain, you wanna come down here<br />and take a look at this?
3354935 3357271 Something's going on.
3357354 3360440 - What do you think, guys?<br />You'll be able to fix that?<br />- Just a minute now.
3365028 3367406 - Okay, I'll be right back.<br />- [Screams I Down!
3372286 3374538 - Stay back!
3374621 3377416 Stay back!
3409865 3412284 Come on. Come on! Shit!
3421084 3424087 - Come on!<br />- Front desk.
3424171 3426524 Call the police. Get your ass<br />down here right now! I'm under attack!
3426548 3431011 - Just relax, mate. Maybe you'll live through this.<br />- Shit!
3454284 3457204 I think he's dead, my dear.
3458872 3461249 All right, let's see to<br />the office work.
3505335 3508588 $7140 billion!
3510048 3512968 Ten times what's in Kentucky!
3513051 3516805 Fort Knox— ha— is for tourists!
3530444 3532738 Yeah? McClane.
3532821 3536158 John, you're out of<br />shape. You barely made it.
3536241 3539953 Yeah, well, we all barely make it.<br />What do you want us to do?
3540037 3542914 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3542998 3545459 - Huh? What...
3545542 3548879 - What'd he say?<br />- What has four legs and is always ready to travel?
3548962 3552424 What's the matter with you? Don't<br />you have kids? That's an elephant joke.
3558221 3560724 Whoa.
3560807 3562726 That a bomb?
3562809 3565854 - Yeah. Go— Go ahead and grab it.<br />- No, you're the cop.
3565937 3568666 - Man, Simon said you're supposed<br />to be helpin' with this.<br />- I'm helpin'.
3568690 3571902 - Well, when are you gonna start helpin'?<br />- After you get the bomb.
3589461 3592339 - Careful.<br />- I'm being careful.
3592422 3596760 - Don't open it.<br />- What? I gotta open it. It's gonna be all right.
3609356 3613026 Shit! Shit!<br />I told you not to open it!
3617697 3619950 I trust you see the message.
3620033 3622536 It has a proximity circuit,<br />so, please, don't run.
3622619 3624788 Yeah, I got it.<br />We're not gonna run.
3624871 3628917 - How do we turn this thing off?<br />- On the fountain, there should be two jugs.
3629000 3632796 Do you see them?<br />A five-gallon and a three-gallon.
3632879 3636967 Fill one of the jugs with exactly<br />four gallons of water.
3637050 3641555 Place it on the scale, and the timer<br />will stop. You must be precise.
3641638 3645183 One ounce or more less<br />will result in detonation.
3645267 3648227 - If you're still alive in five minutes, we'll speak.<br />- Wait! Wait a sec...
3652816 3656236 - 1 don't get it. You get it?<br />- No.
3657154 3660448 Get the jugs.
3660532 3663410 Obviously, we can't fill the<br />three-gallon jug with four gallons, right?
3663493 3666705 - Obviously.<br />- All right, I know. Here we go.
3666788 3670083 - We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?<br />- Uh-huh.
3670167 3672836 We pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug...
3672919 3675755 giving us exactly three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug, right?
3675839 3677757 Right. Then what?
3677841 3681261 - Now, take the three-gallon jug, fill that a third—<br />- No, no. He said be precise.
3681344 3683263 - Shit!<br />- Exactly four gallons.
3683346 3686325 Every cop in 50 miles is runnin' his ass<br />off, and I'm playin' kids' games in a park.
3686349 3690896 Hey! You want to focus<br />on the problem at hand?
3706995 3710540 I thought you said you knew! You<br />said don't say anything if you don't know.
3710624 3713102 - Gimme the fuckin' jug.<br />We're startin' over. Pour that out.<br />- We can't start over.
3713126 3715104 - We can't start over. We can't start over.<br />- We're starting over.
3715128 3717648 Gimme the jug or I'm gonna put<br />my foot up your ass, you dumb mother...
3717672 3721218 - Say it! You were gonna call me<br />a nigger, weren't you?<br />- No, I wasn't!
3721301 3724638 - Yes, you were. What were you gonna call me?<br />- Asshole! How's that?
3724721 3728975 Asshole! You got some fuckin' problem<br />with me ‘cause I'm white, Zeus? Is that it?
3729059 3732062 Have I oppressed you?<br />Have I oppressed your people somehow?
3732145 3735440 - You don't like me 'cause you're a racist!<br />- What?
3735523 3737275 You don't like me<br />‘cause I'm white.
3737359 3741238 I don't like you because you're<br />gonna get me killed. How much time?
3741321 3744741 - Aw, shit! We got less than a minute.<br />Throw this thing away.
3744824 3748328 We can't take it off of there. It'll<br />detonate. Wait a second. Wait a second.
3750413 3753083 - I got it! Exactly two gallons in here, right?<br />- Right.
3753166 3755835 - Leaving exactly one gallon<br />of empty space, right?<br />- Yeah.
3755919 3759798 A full five gallons here. Pour one gallon out<br />of the five gallons into there, we have...
3759881 3762133 - Exactly four gallons!<br />- Yes!
3762217 3764636 Pour it in there. Come on.<br />Come on!
3765804 3767764 Don't spill it.<br />Don't spill it!
3767847 3771268 - Good, good, good. Exactly four gallons.<br />- You did it, McClane.
3771351 3773770 - Put it on the thing! Get it down there!<br />- Oh, shit!
3781695 3784531 Congratulations.<br />You're still alive.
3784614 3787284 - Huh?<br />- Congratulations.
3787367 3790912 - Yeah, we did it.<br />- You surprise me again, John.
3790996 3792914 This is becoming an ugly habit.
3792998 3795750 Yeah, well, I don't have the time<br />right now, Simon. Listen.
3795834 3798586 Deal's a deal.<br />Where's the school bomb?
3798670 3801840 On the contrary,<br />you have lots of time.
3801923 3804217 You have...
3804301 3807345 two hours and 47 minutes precisely.
3807429 3810890 - Plenty of time to test those wits of yours.<br />- Hey! Hey!
3810974 3815145 Hey, listen, jerk-off! Let me tell you<br />somethin'. I got a bad fuckin' hangover!
3815228 3818398 And I'm a little sick of these fuckin'<br />riddles! Now, where is the school bomb?
3818481 3822610 Temper, John.<br />The road to truth has many turns.
3822694 3826156 You will find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3826239 3830535 When you undertake the trip it suggests,<br />ask yourself this question:
3830618 3834247 - What is 21 out of 42?
3836291 3839419 We're behind.<br />We should abandon the rest and go.
3839502 3842047 Relax, Targo.<br />There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3842130 3846718 He's sending us to the home team dugout<br />at Yankee Stadium. Why?
3846801 3849554 Well, we're the home team.<br />Are we supposed to find something there?
3849637 3854809 - What's 21 out of 42?<br />- Twenty-one again. Half of 42. Forty-two what?
3854893 3857896 - How many players are on the Yankees ball club?<br />- Twenty-five.
3857979 3861524 - What else is 21? Blackjack.<br />- It's a club.
3861608 3864235 It's a wild-goose chase<br />is what it is.
3868281 3870617 Where's the nearest “A” train?
3870700 3874454 Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br />You know, some kid might find that.

3960415 3963835 - He's here.<br />- Perhaps you could be a little more specific.
3963918 3968506 McClane is here.<br />He's walking toward the bank.
3968590 3971801 And the black man<br />is coming toward me.
3971885 3977390 Oh, no, that's a pity. And after we've gone<br />to all that trouble at the stadium.
3977474 3979601 Simon, kill him.

4173711 4176297 I said, “Honey, why don't<br />you play a different number?”
4176381 4179717 She says, “Well, those are my lucky<br />numbers.” I got the tickets right here.

4353057 4355643 That's it! Hillary Clinton!<br />The 42nd president.
4355726 4359981 - She'd be the 43rd president.<br />- All right. Who's the 21st?
4360064 4361983 - I don't know.<br />- You don't know?
4362066 4364360 - No, I don't know. Do you know?<br />- No!
4364443 4367947 Well? What kinda engine does this piece<br />of shit have? Step on it!
4368030 4371117 It's a Yugo. It's built for economy,<br />not speed.
4372952 4376205 - Whoa! What are ya doin'?<br />- I'm gonna get us another phone.
4379917 4383462 Wait, wait, wait. Hey!<br />Who was the 21st president?
4383546 4385631 Go fuck yourself!
4387258 4391095 - That guy was pissed.<br />- He'll feel better when he looks in the backseat.
4391178 4395933 - Oh, shit, that was my gold bar!<br />- This is McClane. Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.
4396017 4398745 - John, where the hell are you?<br />- Walter, it's not a revenge. It's a heist.
4398769 4401314 - What?<br />- There's gold in the Federal Reserve...
4401397 4403691 and they took a shitload of it.
4403774 4406319 - They're headed north in dump trucks.<br />- Have you been drinking?
4406402 4408905 No, not since this morning.
4408988 4411800 Listen, there's a line of dump trucks<br />northbound on the F.D.R. at about 70th.
4411824 4414553 You gotta close the bridge and get<br />some helicopters over there right away.

4424545 4428549 - Walter? Shit! Goddamn<br />cellular fuckin' phones!
4428633 4430593 - Get hold of Munson in Triborough.<br />- Inspector.

4439936 4442980 Walter, they don't allow<br />dump trucks on the F.D.R.!

4453491 4456953 I could spend a week in here with<br />an X-ray machine and still not find it.

4500955 4503624 Relax, Targo.<br />If he is still alive...
4503708 4507670 - he won't be talking to anyone.

4708954 4711790 Planning for it<br />began back in 1954...
4711874 4714710 but construction didn't begin<br />till June of 1970.

4927881 4929883 Westchester's probably<br />worse than we are.
4929967 4932821 This is kinda puttin' all our eggs in<br />one basket. What if McClane's wrong?
