908574 909909 Bob Simons was<br />a bankrupt businessman
909992 911577 who kidnapped<br />his partner's daughter.
911660 913078 He's a fuck-up,<br />not a psycho.
913162 914538 The guy we're looking for<br />is nuts.
914622 917499 A nut who knows a lot<br />about bombs.
917583 920461 We found this in a playground.<br />Professional.
920544 924173 -Very cool stuff.<br />You know, boom!<br />-(slams briefcase)
924256 925925 You think you should slam it<br />around like that, Charlie?
926008 927801 It's unmixed.<br />You can't hurt it.
927885 930512 This stuff is cutting edge.<br />It's a binary liquid.
930596 935476 -A what?<br />-Like epoxy, two liquids.
935559 938354 Now, either one<br />by itself...
939480 943150 you got nothing,<br />but mix 'em--
954244 957957 Ricky?
958040 959625 -(loud blast)<br />-(screaming)
959708 962836 Charlie,<br />you're gonna be wearing<br />that chair up your ass!
962920 965965 -Christ Almighty, Charlie!<br />-(chuckling) Like I said,<br />very cool stuff.
966048 968592 Now, with a package like this,<br />you get a warning.
968676 970135 Now, the bomb<br />has to arm itself.
970219 972888 You'll see the red liquid
972972 975349 pump into the clear<br />before it detonates.
975432 978602 -How long before?<br />-Ten seconds, two minutes.
978686 980938 It could be anything.
981021 983899 But once it's mixed,<br />be somewhere else.
983983 986193 That stuff has gotta<br />be pretty rare.
986276 989196 We oughta be able to find out f<br />any of it's missing somewhere.
989279 991490 Already did.<br />Livermore Labs theft<br />over the weekend.
991573 993993 He got enough to make<br />another one, Joe?
994076 997121 -About 2,000 pounds.<br />-Of that?
997204 1000582 CHARLIE:<br />The detonating mechanism could<br />be anything-- radio, electrical.
1000666 1003335 Hell, you could use a beeper<br />and phone it in.
1003419 1005546 Inspector?<br />Inspector, it's him.
1005629 1007923 CHARLIE:<br />He's got a double Alberti<br />feedback loop on it.
1008007 1010009 -A nasty little trick<br />I believe once used in Lebanon.<br />-Charlie. Charlie!
1010092 1012261 -Charlie, shh!<br />-What--
1012344 1014638 You wanna start<br />the trace?
1020728 1022938 Simon.
1023022 1026191 SIMON:<br />He wore the board, walked<br />the street and survived.
1026275 1029528 (speaks German)<br />Where are my pigeons now?
1029611 1031613 Pigeons?
1031697 1035367 I had two pigeons,<br />bright and gay,<br />fly from me the other day.
1035451 1038954 Why was it they did go?<br />You cannot tell.<br />You do not know.
1039038 1043083 -You mean McClane?<br />-No, I mean Santa Claus.
1045419 1048922 -Yeah, I'm here.<br />-Ah, there after all.<br />And your friend?
1049006 1051050 RICKY:<br />Carver! Carver!
1051133 1053677 Come on. We need you<br />in the other room.<br />Let's go! Come on!
1053761 1055679 They need you. Go.
1055763 1058974 -Yeah, he's here too.<br />-And may I speak with him?
1060476 1063020 Well, is the ebony<br />Samaritan there now?
1063103 1064688 You got a problem with ebony?
1064772 1066565 No, no. My only problem
1066648 1068067 is that I went<br />to some trouble
1068150 1070360 preparing that game<br />for McClane.
1070444 1072571 You interfered with<br />a well-laid plan.
1072654 1077034 Yeah? Well, you can<br />stick your well-laid plan<br />up your well-laid ass.
1077117 1079078 (dial tone)
1079161 1082539 COBB:<br />That was not smart.<br />There are lives at stake here!
1082623 1084541 Not enough time,<br />Inspector.
1084625 1086919 You better hope<br />he calls back.
1087002 1089546 -He will.<br />-(loud chattering)
1089630 1093926 Ricky, you wanna tell<br />those people to shut<br />the hell up out there?
1094009 1096887 RICKY:<br />Hey, keep it down here!
1096970 1100140 (chattering stops)
1101725 1103727 (phone rings)
1105229 1108440 Simon, he wasn't speaking<br />for all of us.
1108524 1111652 SIMON:<br />That was unpleasant.<br />Don't let it happen again.
1111735 1113821 So, what's your name,<br />boy?
1113904 1116156 -Don't call me boy.<br />-I'm sorry.
1116240 1118659 It was a poor attempt<br />at humor.
1118742 1120994 I was going to send<br />you home with a chiding,
1121078 1123580 -but now I think perhaps<br />you should join the game.<br />-We got him!
1123664 1125666 It's a pay phone in Oslo.
1125749 1128168 -CONNIE: No, wait,<br />they say it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />-Norway?
1128252 1131505 -Wait. Now they're saying<br />it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />-CONNIE: Forget it!
1131588 1134508 Australia? He's<br />scrambling up their system.<br />They don't know where he is.
1134591 1137803 SIMON: Having fun with<br />the phone company, are we?
1137886 1140514 Simon says,<br />McClane and the Samaritan
1140597 1143600 will go to the subway station<br />at 72nd and Broadway.
1143684 1147187 I will call you in<br />15 minutes on the pay phone<br />outside the station.
1147271 1150774 No police.<br />Failure to answer will<br />constitute noncompliance.
1150858 1153193 Do you understand me,<br />John?
1153277 1154653 Oh, yes, I understand.
1154736 1156488 I understand that<br />you're a fuckin' wacko
1156572 1158740 that likes to play kids' games,<br />that's what I understand.
1158824 1161034 -Hardly.<br />-(imitating Simon's accent)<br />"Hardly"?
1161118 1164329 Well, then, who are you?<br />Somebody I sent up?<br />What'd you do?
1164413 1166790 Shoplifting?<br />Purse snatching?
1166874 1168792 Cross-dressing?<br />What?
1168876 1170669 You c-c-couldn't catch me
1170752 1173172 if I stole your ch-ch-chair<br />with you in it.
1173255 1176341 My ch-ch-chair with me in it?<br />Ooh-hoo! That's very exciting.
1176425 1178802 Let me ask you a question,<br />bonehead.
1178886 1181221 Why are you trying<br />to k-k-k-k-kill me?
1181305 1183223 -John, John, calm yourself.<br />-Huh?
1183307 1184766 Why don't you<br />come on down here
1184850 1186226 and we'll figure this out<br />like a couple of men?
1186310 1188478 -Just come on down here.<br />-(Simon chuckling)
1188562 1191440 -If killing you was all I<br />wanted, you'd be dead by now.<br />-Simon.
1191523 1195194 This is Inspector Cobb.<br />I can appreciate your<br />feelings for McClane,
1195277 1197696 but believe me,<br />the jerk isn't worth it.
1197779 1200490 He stepped on so many toes<br />in this department,
1200574 1203243 by this time next month<br />he's going to be<br />a security guard.
1203327 1205495 His own wife wants nothing<br />to do with him,
1205579 1208457 and he's about<br />two steps shy of becoming<br />a full-blown alcoholic.
1208540 1211084 (whispering)<br />One step. One step!
1211168 1213420 Now listen to me.
1213503 1217090 You sound like a real smart guy.<br />What is it that you want?
1217174 1219259 Are you talking<br />about money?
1219343 1222095 Well, whatever, whatever.
1222179 1224848 McClane is a toilet bug.
1224932 1228602 Now what would it take<br />just to forget him and<br />live happily ever after?
1228685 1230771 SIMON:<br />You know, money<br />is shit to me.
1230854 1232272 I would not give up McClane
1232356 1235192 for all the gold<br />in your Fort Knox.
1235275 1237778 72nd Street subway,<br />pay phone, 15 minutes.
1237861 1240280 McClane<br />and the Samaritan.
1240364 1242950 If you're competent<br />in the least, you've<br />found the briefcase.
1243033 1245911 So you know what I mean<br />by penalty.
1245994 1248455 (dial tone)
1248538 1251208 I wanna thank you for that<br />vote of confidence, Walter.
1251291 1252584 Well, I thought<br />it was worth a try.
1252668 1254544 This guy's a raving maniac.
1254628 1256838 He couldn't be any<br />clearer if he got it<br />from a case history.
1256922 1260259 He gave you clues<br />to his identity.<br />He spoke German.
1260342 1261468 He called it<br />"your Fort Knox."
1261551 1264263 And he stammered<br />when McClane pushed him.
1264346 1267266 COBB:<br />Now, you believe this guy<br />really can't be bought?
1267349 1271395 There's no chance.<br />The very mention of money<br />only enraged him further.
1278568 1281613 -What's that?<br />-COBB: It's your shield.
1281697 1284700 -You asking me to be<br />a cop again, Walter?<br />-Ricky, get him his gun.
1284783 1287327 -You didn't answer my question.<br />-Joe, this time<br />they go with back--
1287411 1291331 Hey! You didn't answer<br />my question, Walter.
1291415 1293500 Are you done,<br />Lieutenant?
1293583 1295836 Now, you two<br />better get going
1295919 1298255 if you're going to get up<br />to 72nd Street on time.
1298338 1300841 -Joe, this time<br />they go with backup.<br />-You got it.
1300924 1303719 -COBB: Come on, you guys!<br />-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />I'm not going anywhere.
1303802 1307806 -Simon says you gotta go!<br />-I'm not jumping through hoops<br />for some psycho.
1307889 1310684 That's a white man<br />with white problems.<br />You deal with him.
1310767 1312978 Call me when he crosses<br />110th Street.
1313061 1315814 Hey!<br />Why'd you save my ass?
1315897 1319985 I didn't.<br />I stopped a white cop from<br />getting killed in Harlem.
1320068 1322654 One white cop<br />gets killed today,
1322738 1325824 tomorrow we got a thousand<br />white cops, all of them<br />with itchy trigger fingers.
1325907 1328660 Got it?
1328744 1331371 Get him back.
1331455 1334833 -Charlie, where'd<br />you find that bomb?<br />-Chinatown.
1334916 1336918 Shit.
1337002 1339880 Zeus! Yo, partner!<br />Wait up!
1339963 1342257 Hey, hey, hey, hey.<br />I ain't your partner.
1342341 1343967 I ain't your neighbor,<br />your brother or your friend.
1344051 1346678 I'm your total stranger.
1346762 1348889 Okay. Stranger,
1348972 1352726 you know where that park<br />is at 115th Street<br />and St. Nicholas?
1354019 1356229 Yeah, it's in Harlem.
1356313 1358899 Where do you think<br />we found that bomb?
1358982 1362402 Listen, this guy doesn't<br />care about skin color,
1362486 1364488 even if you do.
1366656 1370285 -What am I doin'?<br />-Cheer up.<br />Things could be worse.
1370369 1372788 I was working on<br />a nice, fat suspension,
1372871 1375957 smokin' cigarettes<br />and watching Captain Kangaroo.
1376041 1378377 Come on.
1380379 1381505 Is that the phone?
1384007 1387677 -(car horns honking)<br />-CONNIE: Okay,<br />they made it to the phone.
1387761 1390597 -But there's a problem.<br />-COBB: What do you mean?<br />How big a problem?
1390680 1392391 Oh, about 300 pounds.
1392474 1394434 -(chattering)<br />-Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
1394518 1396770 -We need this phone for<br />official police business.<br />-Do you mind?
1396853 1398814 -Honey, I'm a cop. I need<br />the phone right now--<br />-I'm sorry, but I--
1398897 1401942 -Get off the damn phone,<br />lady, Police business!<br />-Well, I never!
1402025 1403944 I can get used to this.
1404027 1406822 I'm sure you can find a phone<br />across the street, ma'am.
1406905 1409616 Let's get something straight.<br />I'm the only one here<br />on official police business.
1409699 1412494 -Don't ever do that shit again.<br />-Let's get something else<br />straight.
1412577 1414496 You need me a lot more<br />than I need you.
1414579 1416498 You don't like the way<br />I do things, fine.
1416581 1419584 -I quit.<br />-(phone ringing)
1424589 1428051 -(ringing)<br />-All right, I need you.
1430595 1432597 (ringing)
1434516 1436059 All right, I need you<br />more than you need me.
1436143 1437853 (ringing continues)
1440772 1442441 Hello.
1442524 1443942 SIMON:<br />Birds of a feather<br />flock together.
1444025 1445402 So do pigs and swine.
1445485 1446862 Rats and mice<br />have their chance,
1446945 1448655 as will I have mine.
1448738 1450615 Nice. It rhymes.
1450699 1452075 Why was the phone busy?
1452159 1454411 -Who were you calling?<br />-The psychic hotline.
1454494 1456455 I'd advise you to take this<br />more seriously.
1456538 1458540 Look, it's a public phone!<br />What do you want me to say?
1458623 1460000 You can simply say<br />there was a fat woman on it
1460083 1464004 and it took you a minute<br />to get her off!
1464087 1467424 Now, John, there's<br />a significant amount<br />of explosive
1467507 1469718 in the trash receptacle<br />next to you.
1471595 1473972 Try to run,<br />and it goes up now.
1474055 1477642 -Nobody's gonna run, but<br />I got 100 people out here.<br />-That's the point.
1477726 1479978 Now, do I have<br />your attention?
1480061 1482647 As I was going to St. Ives,<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1482731 1486693 Every wife had seven sacks.<br />Every sack had seven cats.<br />Every cat had seven kittens.
1486776 1488069 Kittens, cats,<br />sacks and wives.
1488153 1489905 How many were going<br />to St. Ives?
1489988 1492532 -My phone number is 555--<br />-No, no, no! Wait!
1492616 1493658 I didn't get all that!<br />Say it again!
1493742 1495702 Not a chance.
1495785 1497913 -My phone number<br />is 555 and the answer.<br />-But I didn't--
1497996 1500123 Call me in 30 seconds<br />or die.
1500207 1502083 (dial tone)
1502167 1504669 All right, seven guys<br />with seven wives--
1504753 1507339 -Shut up, McClane.<br />I'm good at this.<br />-Seven guys with seven wives--
1507422 1509883 Shut the fuck up, McClane!<br />He said seven wives<br />with seven sacks.
1509966 1513595 -Seven times seven is 49.<br />Now tell me the rest.<br />-Uh, a sack with seven--
1513678 1515931 -Weren't you listening?<br />-Yeah! I didn't hear<br />every fuckin'--
1516014 1518350 -What is wrong with you?<br />-Besides having a bad fucking<br />hangover, for one thing!
1518433 1520393 All right, all right!
1520477 1523980 Seven wives times seven, 49.<br />With seven cats. Seven times<br />49 is... 343, right?
1524064 1526066 -Are you asking me<br />or telling me?<br />-I'm telling you.
1526149 1529903 343 times seven is--<br />One, zero, 24. 2,401!
1529986 1532656 -That's what you got, right?<br />-Yeah, that's what I got.
1532739 1534658 -Is that it, 2,401?<br />-That's it. Dial.
1534741 1538995 BOTH:<br />555-2401.
1539079 1541540 -No, wait, wait!<br />It's a trick, it's a trick.<br />-What? What do you mean?
1541623 1544793 -I forgot about the man.<br />-What man? Fuck the man!<br />We got 10 seconds!
1544876 1547128 He said, how many were going<br />to St. Ives, right?
1547212 1551132 The riddle begins:<br />As I was going to St. Ives,<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1551216 1553969 -The guy and his wives<br />aren't going anywhere.<br />-What are they doing?
1554052 1556721 Sittin' in the fuckin' road<br />waiting on-- How the hell<br />should I know, McClane?
1556805 1559849 -Who's going<br />to St. Ives then?<br />-The guy. Just the guy.
1559933 1562143 -Just one guy?<br />Just one guy.<br />-The answer's one.
1562227 1564646 -How do you dial one?<br />-555-0001.
1564729 1566481 Zero, zero, one.<br />Just one guy's goin'?
1566565 1568066 SIMON: Hello, John.
1568149 1570110 Yeah, piece of cake! Give us<br />something harder next time.
1570193 1573989 -But you're 10 seconds late.<br />-No, no! The answer is one!
1574072 1577450 There's a bomb<br />in the trash!<br />Get down!
1577534 1579578 McLANE (shouting):<br />Get down!
1579661 1581830 There's a bomb!
1581913 1584791 Get down!<br />There's a bomb!
1587627 1590005 MAN:<br />Welcome to New York.
1592007 1593842 (crowd chattering)
1593925 1597929 Here, you can have it.<br />Come on. Come on. Let's go.
1600849 1602934 (Simon laughing)
1611985 1614029 No bomb.
1615572 1619701 (Simon laughing)
1619784 1623580 -Yeah.<br />-I didn't say,<br />Simon says.
1623663 1628418 It's 9:50, John.<br />The number 3 train<br />is arriving now.
1628501 1631755 -I left something provocative<br />on that train, John.<br />-(subway train rumbling)
1631838 1634633 Simon says,<br />get to the pay phone
1634716 1637761 next to the news kiosk in<br />Wall Street station by 10:20,
1637844 1640972 or the number 3 train<br />and its passengers vaporize.

1644851 1647646 Attempt to evacuate the<br />subway, I blow the train.
1647729 1650649 I'll call you in 30 minutes.<br />Be there.
1650732 1652108 We're fucked.
1652192 1655528 Ninety blocks in 30 minutes<br />in New York traffic?
1655612 1657822 It could be double that.
1657906 1660533 We don't even<br />have a car!
1660617 1662661 Hey! Hey! Sir! Sir!<br />I'm a cop! I'm a cop!
1662744 1664913 -I am requisitioning this car<br />for official police business.<br />-What are you doing?
1664996 1667123 -Thank you very much.<br />-What the fuck are you<br />doing to my car?
1667207 1668917 -Get in, get in!<br />-Pretty slick.

1672087 1675548 -(tires squealing)<br />-CAB DRIVER: What the fuck<br />are you doing?
1675632 1679052 -(car horns honking)<br />-(Zeus screaming)
1679135 1681221 What were you saying?
1681304 1685183 I was saying, I used to<br />drive a cab, and Ninth Avenue<br />was the fastest way south.
1685266 1687686 But we seem<br />to be going east.
1687769 1691189 -(brakes screeching)<br />-(car horns honking)
1691272 1694025 -(horn honking)<br />-Where the hell<br />are you going, McClane?
1694109 1696528 I told you Ninth Avenue<br />was the quickest way south!
1696611 1698863 Stop with that goddamn yelling!<br />I know what I'm doing!
1698947 1700699 Not even God knows<br />what you're doing!
1700782 1703493 They're headed east on 72nd<br />towards the park.
1703576 1706871 -But Wall Street is south!<br />-Man, stop yelling at me!<br />I got a bad headache.
1706955 1709999 And the best way south<br />is not Ninth Avenue.<br />It's through the park.
1710083 1712085 (horn honking)
1712168 1716756 Oh, dear. I told you that<br />Park Drive is always jammed.
1716840 1720802 -I didn't say Park Drive.<br />-(tires squealing)
1720885 1723012 I said<br />through the park.
1723096 1725890 -(horn honking)<br />-(brakes screeching)
1725974 1728852 Shit! We lost 'em.<br />They're in the park<br />headed south.

2429885 2433973 -It's good to meet you.<br />-This is Lieutenant McClane.<br />This is Mr. Carver.
2435808 2438644 CROSS:<br />We got a couple of<br />questions first.
2438727 2440020 Do you recognize this guy?
2443691 2446360 No.
2446444 2448696 CROSS:<br />How about this one?
2451157 2453492 Mm-mmm.
2453576 2454702 CROSS:<br />How about you?
2456996 2459665 Did you recognize<br />the voice on the phone?
2459748 2461667 No.
2461750 2465838 Did you notice any cars<br />following you?
2465921 2468549 No.
2468632 2471760 Anybody following you at all?<br />Any kind of surveillance?
2471844 2474847 Telephone? House?<br />Anything unusual at all?
2474930 2477850 (sighs)<br />Well,
2477933 2480769 now that you mention it,<br />I have experienced a--
2480853 2483606 you know, like a burning<br />sensation between my toes.
2483689 2487651 I thought it was just some<br />athlete's foot or something.<br />I don't know.
2489862 2492990 We read your jacket,<br />Lieutenant. We were told<br />you would be cooperative.
2493073 2495576 -Cooperate with what?<br />-Hey, now wait a minute.<br />He will be.
2495659 2497495 We're just wasting time here<br />in this goddamn van.
2497578 2499330 You want to share information,
2499413 2501332 how about sending a little<br />our way as well?
2501415 2503584 We wanna hear<br />what he knows first.
2503667 2505794 -COBB: What the hell?<br />You give us pictures and then--<br />-We want to hear what he knows.
2505878 2509548 Hey, I know as much<br />as you know. All right?
2509632 2512092 There's a guy out there<br />setting off bombs.
2512176 2515679 He calls himself Simon.<br />He speaks with a German accent.
2515763 2518682 And for some reason,<br />he's very angry with me.
2518766 2521810 Now, maybe you can<br />tell me why, fellas.<br />Huh?
2526899 2530027 The first man there<br />is Methias Targo.
2530110 2533030 Was Hungarian Army.<br />Explosives expert.
2533113 2535366 -Now we believe he's<br />working for the Iranians.<br />-Working?
2535449 2537910 Freelance terrorism.<br />By contract.
2539828 2542414 -McCLANE: Who's the girl?<br />-CROSS: Targo's other half.
2542498 2544750 Rumor is Israelis slipped<br />a bomb in between their sheets.
2544833 2546085 Uh, he wasn't at home,
2546168 2548420 but they think<br />maybe they got her.
2548504 2549630 JARVIS:<br />The second man was
2549713 2552591 an obscure colonel<br />in the East German Army.
2552675 2556595 He ran an infiltration unit.<br />The kind of thing the Nazis did<br />at the Battle of the Bulge.
2556679 2558639 English-speaking troops--
2558722 2561392 Yeah, yeah,<br />I saw the movie.
2561475 2562851 All we know of him is
2562935 2566564 the G.D.R. medical records<br />show he suffers from migraines.
2566647 2569608 His name is Peter Krieg.
2571860 2575447 Well, that is<br />an exceptional report,<br />fellas.
2575531 2578450 Now, do you want to tell me<br />what the hell this<br />has to do with me?
2578534 2580869 The name Gruber mean<br />anything to you, Lieutenant?
2585165 2587543 It rings a bell, yeah.
2587626 2589628 -L.A.<br />-COBB: What?
2589712 2592047 That thing in<br />the building in L.A.
2593882 2595884 Peter Krieg...
2595968 2599972 was born Simon Peter Gruber.
2600055 2604518 He's Hans Gruber's brother.
2606895 2609565 -(phone ringing)<br />-(whispers) Holy shit.
2609648 2612693 Yeah, it's that thing<br />in L.A.
2612776 2615696 We figure he's got you<br />fitted up for a toe tag,
2615779 2618741 and he's gonna do anything<br />to get it tied.
2618824 2621869 Inspector!<br />Inspector, it's him.
2623871 2625873 Don't let him know<br />we're here.
2628250 2631879 -Simon.<br />-SIMON: Inspector.
2631962 2634965 Now, who from the F.B.I.<br />is in the van, I wonder?
2635049 2638135 Let's see.<br />Almost certainly Cross.<br />Come on, Andrew. Say hello.
2638218 2640095 Hello.
2640179 2643599 And I know you never run<br />alone, so say hello, Bill.
2643682 2646644 Still trying to butch up by<br />chewing on your glasses, huh?
2646727 2648771 (Simon snickering)
2648854 2653609 This, gentlemen, as they say,<br />is where the plot thickens.
2653692 2655819 I have put<br />2,400 pounds of explosive
2655903 2659531 in one of the 1,446 schools<br />in greater New York.
2659615 2662951 It is fitted with<br />a timer set to explode<br />at exactly 3:00 p.m.
2664995 2667665 Thank you. Your silence<br />says I'm understood.
2667748 2670542 COBB:<br />Did you say 2,400 pounds?
2670626 2672795 SIMON:<br />Yes, but please don't<br />interrupt again!
2672878 2675923 Simon says, if you attempt<br />to evacuate schools,
2676006 2677925 the bomb will be detonated<br />by radio.
2678008 2680177 And, gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.
2680260 2684556 Repeat, one school will be<br />dismissed at 3:00 p.m.<br />permanently, unless--
2684640 2686809 Unless what?
2686892 2688018 Unless John McClane<br />and his new best friend
2688102 2689186 complete the tasks<br />I set them.
2689269 2690979 John, are you listening?
2693774 2698570 -Yeah.<br />-The pay phone beyond Hope,<br />Tompkins Square Park.
2698654 2701240 Twenty minutes.<br />Go by foot. No rush.
2701323 2703951 If you're really clever,<br />you'll learn the location<br />of the bomb
2704034 2705536 and the code to disarm it.
2705619 2707663 Oh, and by the way,<br />gentlemen,
2707746 2710749 we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.
2710833 2712918 The only problem is the<br />darn things seem to respond
2713001 2715671 to police and F.B.I.<br />frequencies.
2715754 2718716 So if I were you,<br />I'd keep off your radios.
2718799 2721135 -Simon, wait.<br />-(dial tone)
2724888 2727891 2,400 pounds<br />of that liquid stuff.
2727975 2731520 My God.<br />Get me the commissioner.
2731603 2732771 WOMAN: He's doing a<br />press conference.
2732855 2734690 He's supposed to be here<br />in half an hour.
2734773 2737860 Ricky, get every<br />senior officer on the site.<br />Get 'em here right away.
2737943 2740612 You're not gonna give me<br />any jurisdictional nonsense<br />on this?
2740696 2744867 I got two kids<br />in the school on 64th Street.<br />What can I do to help you?
2744950 2747077 -How many men have you got?<br />-Seventy-five.
2747161 2749705 But if I push the panic button,<br />I can get 500 from Washington.
2749788 2752166 -When?<br />-2:30, 3:00.
2752249 2754084 Between now and then--
2754168 2758756 We're gonna have to do this<br />all by ourselves. Let's go.
2758839 2762092 Now, Tompkins Square Park<br />is more than two miles away,<br />so you guys better get running.
2762176 2764803 No radios.<br />You take my telephone.
2764887 2768015 You get anything, you call<br />me through the switchboard.<br />Good luck.
2768098 2770934 Thanks.<br />Find that bomb.
2771018 2773729 -Ricky, where are they?<br />-Right over here.
2773812 2776106 -The senior man present<br />is Chief Allen.<br />-Chief of what?
2776190 2778609 -Transit.<br />-Okay, thanks, Ricky.
2778692 2781612 Gentlemen, we have<br />a decision to make.<br />Chief Allen.
2781695 2784114 The man who has done this<br />has told us
2784198 2786033 that he has planted another<br />very large bomb
2786116 2789203 in a school<br />here in the New York area.
2789286 2791038 And he has told us that we<br />cannot evacuate,
2791121 2793832 but he has not said<br />that we cannot search.
2793916 2796794 Now, I recommend<br />we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody--
2796877 2799046 I'm talking about police,<br />transit, sanitation, fire,
2799129 2800923 even the goddamn librarians--
2801006 2805052 and we start searching schools,<br />and I mean right now.
2805135 2807805 I'm talking about<br />1,000 buildings<br />within the city limits.
2807888 2810265 And we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it in.
2810349 2813560 Now, I'd like to<br />keep the media out of this<br />as long as possible,
2813644 2816230 because if they get in,<br />we've got a panic.
2816313 2818232 Are we in agreement?
2818315 2821568 -MAN:<br />Come on, guys! Let's go!<br />-(sirens wailing)
2821652 2823904 MAN (on P.A.):<br />Move it out!<br />Move it out!
2823987 2827157 No radio contact.<br />No radio contact.
2836333 2839169 They bought it.
2839253 2841588 You can begin.
2841672 2846176 (sirens blaring)
2846260 2849263 (tires squealing)
2849346 2851890 (sirens continue)
2856353 2858897 Hook, line...
2861900 2864736 -and sinker.<br />-(horn honking)
2869074 2871702 OFFICER:<br />All right now, men,<br />let's go! Let's go!
2871785 2874788 (officers shouting, chattering)
2879293 2884298 (sirens wailing)
2890429 2892931 -(phones ringing)<br />-(voices overlapping)
2895934 2898145 -(ringing continues)<br />-(voices continue)
2905235 2908697 Sergeant Turley!<br />Sergeant Turley!
2908780 2911950 In the last five minutes,<br />the volume in calls in here<br />has tripled!
2912034 2915078 -What the hell is goin' on?<br />-Stop. Let me explain.
2915162 2916955 For the rest of the day,
2917039 2919333 we're supposed to handle<br />the department's communications.
2919416 2921376 What do you mean "handle"?
2921460 2923045 They're shutting down<br />the police band.
2923128 2925464 All calls will be coming<br />through this switchboard.
2925547 2927925 And I'm gonna marry<br />Donald Trump!
2928008 2930093 Walsh, what's going on?
2930177 2932095 Why'd everybody<br />tear out of here?
2932179 2934389 Come on, Pamela.<br />Look at your watch!
2934473 2935891 It's coming up on<br />shift change.
2935974 2938101 The bean counters<br />are worried about overtime,
2938185 2940938 so we sent everybody<br />back to the precinct<br />to punch out.
2941021 2942814 The next shift<br />is gonna be here in a minute.
2942898 2944691 You are so full of shit,<br />Walsh.
2944775 2947069 Thank you.
2950781 2953992 (engines roaring)
2954076 2956244 What the hell?
2965420 2968048 Hey! Whoa!<br />Whoa! Whoa!
2968131 2971301 (American accent)<br />Detective.<br />Bob Thompson.
2971385 2973929 City Engineer's Office.
2974012 2976932 We'd like to get<br />an idea of the damage.
2978517 2981770 Man, you guys<br />really got here fast.
2982938 2986400 Well, it's<br />Wall Street, sir.
2986483 2989069 A lot of money here.
2989152 2993490 A lot of opinion makers<br />the mayor doesn't wanna<br />piss off, you know?
2995409 2998036 Is this it?
2999913 3002874 Holy Toledo!
3002958 3005460 Somebody had fun.
3005544 3010257 I'd appreciate it if<br />you'd show my associates<br />the way down.
3011967 3014970 Yeah. Yeah, sure.<br />Jimmy!
3015053 3018807 You got the flashlight?<br />Murphy, come on! You too!
3018890 3021393 -Rick Walsh.<br />-John Gunther.
3021476 3023979 Come on, gentlemen.<br />Let's go.
3026857 3028817 You were probably<br />at the World Trades.
3028900 3030235 You know what<br />that mess was.
3047127 3050130 (alarm bell ringing)
3052591 3055552 (ringing continues)
3062976 3064853 (Swedish accent)<br />Please inform Mr. Little
3064936 3066521 that Mr. Vanderfloog<br />is here.
3066605 3070233 -SECURITY GUARD:<br />Mr. Vanderfloog?<br />-(alarm ringing)
3070317 3073236 GUARD:<br />There's a Mr. Vanderfloog<br />for Mr. Little.
3086666 3091338 (shouting in German)
3091421 3094424 -A lot of steam down here.<br />-Yeah, yeah. We snapped<br />a couple of the steam pipes.
3094508 3096968 It's like a sauna.
3097052 3099262 -We got the subway guys to<br />shut down the third rail.<br />-MAN: Emergency lighting.
3099346 3102099 Yeah, emergency lights,<br />and there's still some light--<br />Hey!
3102182 3103850 -(gunfire)<br />-No shooting!
3103934 3106019 -(speaking German)<br />-Speak English!
3106103 3108480 Otto doesn't speak English.<br />Do you, Otto?
3108563 3113110 -Where the hell<br />did we get this guy?<br />-He's one of Targo's thugs.
3113193 3115028 (Targo speaking German)<br />Pull all the way up!
3115112 3117239 Pull all the way!<br />Pull all the way!
3123620 3126832 So what's up<br />with this L.A. thing?<br />You famous or something?
3126915 3129126 Yeah, for<br />about five minutes.
3129209 3132003 -Don't tell me.<br />Rodney King, right?<br />-Fuck you.
3132087 3134422 -You know this guy Simon<br />we were talking to?<br />-Yeah.
3134506 3136466 I threw his little brother<br />off the 32nd floor of
3136550 3138301 the Nakatomi Towers<br />out in L.A.
3138385 3141221 -I guess he's a little<br />pissed off about it.<br />-Wait a minute.
3141304 3144099 You mean to tell me<br />I'm in this shit<br />because some white cop
3144182 3146351 threw some white asshole's<br />brother off a roof?
3158321 3161199 (alarm bell ringing)
3176506 3179176 -(alarm stops)<br />-(elevator bell dings)
3191646 3194065 Mr. Vanderfloog?<br />Felix Little,<br />Corporate Relations.
3194149 3195442 Sorry you had to wait,
3195525 3197944 but apparently there was<br />an explosion in the subway.
3198028 3199946 It's played hell<br />with our alarms, I'm afraid.
3200030 3201114 I trust there's<br />nothing wrong.
3201198 3204117 Oh, no. Good Lord, no.<br />Safe and secure.
3204201 3207162 Now, you were concerned<br />about a currency exchange?
3207245 3210332 We are not<br />a commercial bank,<br />in the normal sense.
3210415 3213335 We're--<br />We're primarily, uh,
3213418 3216046 governments, central banks,<br />that sort of thing.
3216129 3217380 Apart from the depository,<br />of course.
3217464 3219591 Of course.
3219674 3222469 And you are in<br />the flower business,<br />Mr. Vanderfloog?
3226264 3228475 Back! Back!<br />Come on!
3251665 3254209 Come on!
3266179 3268265 (rattling loudly)
3268348 3271226 Oh, no, Mr. Vanderfloog,<br />that's the vault elevator.
3272686 3276314 I'm sorry.<br />Our alarms are<br />sonic and seismic.
3276398 3278775 Two things which,<br />I'm afraid, do not react<br />well to explosions.
3278858 3280277 You know,<br />this subway business
3280360 3282779 has knocked all our systems<br />into a cocked hat.
3282862 3286157 In fact, we've had to<br />give up and pull the plug<br />on the whole thing.
3286241 3288159 The repair people<br />are downstairs now.
3288243 3290120 -Good Lord!<br />-(chuckling) Yes, yes.
3290203 3293415 -Heavens to Betsy<br />if anyone knew!<br />-(beeping)
3295834 3297711 -(beeping)<br />-But...
3297794 3300171 I thought this was<br />a currency exchange.
3300255 3303508 Oh, I think we'll go<br />straight to the withdrawal.
3303591 3306720 (gun hisses)
3306803 3309597 Danke.
3316438 3319274 -(gun cocks)<br />-(speaking German)
3344883 3348261 -(rumbling)<br />-(bricks rattling)
3351765 3354517 Hey, Captain,<br />you wanna come down here<br />and take a look at this?
3354601 3356811 Something's going on.
3356895 3360273 -What do you think, guys?<br />You'll be able to fix that?<br />-Just a minute now.
3364527 3367197 -Okay, I'll be right back.<br />-(screams) Down!
3371701 3374120 -GUARD: Stay back!<br />-(gunfire)
3374204 3377207 Stay back!
3409406 3411825 Come on. Come on!<br />Shit!
3420667 3423586 -GUARD: Come on!<br />-MAN (on phone):<br />Front desk.
3423670 3425839 Call the police. Get your ass<br />down here right now!<br />I'm under attack!
3425922 3429134 Just relax, mate.<br />Maybe you'll live through this.
3429217 3430552 Shit!
3434764 3436724 (screaming)
3441396 3444732 (screaming continues)
3444816 3447777 -(screaming)<br />-(blade whooshing)
3447861 3450447 (groaning)
3453867 3456703 I think he's dead,<br />my dear.
3458455 3460790 All right, let's see to<br />the office work.
3460874 3464377 (man speaking German)
3466421 3470383 (speaking German)
3481394 3483396 God! It's Fort Knox.
3486608 3489569 (German)
3504834 3508296 $140 billion!
3509547 3512509 Ten times<br />what's in Kentucky!
3512592 3516554 Fort Knox-- ha--<br />is for tourists!
3518473 3521893 (phone ringing)
3524479 3526648 (ringing continues)
3530026 3532403 Yeah? McClane.<br />(panting)
3532487 3535740 SIMON:<br />John, you're out of shape.<br />You barely made it.
3535823 3539577 Yeah, well,<br />we all barely make it.<br />What do you want us to do?
3539661 3542413 What has four legs<br />and is always ready<br />to travel?
3542497 3544874 -Huh? What--<br />-(dial tone)
3544958 3548378 -What'd he say?<br />-What has four legs and<br />is always ready to travel?
3548461 3550672 What's the matter with you?<br />Don't you have kids?
3550755 3551881 That's an elephant joke.
3553341 3556344 (grunting, panting)
3557804 3560306 Whoa.<br />(panting)
3560390 3562559 That a bomb?
3562642 3564644 -Yeah. Go--<br />Go ahead and grab it.<br />-No, you're the cop.
3564727 3565812 Man, Simon said you're<br />supposed to be helpin'<br />with this.
3565895 3568022 I'm helpin'.
3568106 3571526 -Well, when are you<br />gonna start helpin'?<br />-After you get the bomb.
3589002 3591879 -Careful.<br />-I'm being careful.
3591963 3594632 -Don't open it.<br />-What? I gotta open it.
3594716 3596509 It's gonna be all right.
3599178 3601764 (latches click open)
3604058 3606811 (whirring, beeping)
3608855 3612567 Shit! Shit!<br />I told you not to open it!
3612650 3615903 (cell phone ringing)
3617405 3619490 SIMON:<br />I trust you see the message.
3619574 3622076 It has a proximity circuit,<br />so, please, don't run.
3622160 3624370 Yeah, I got it.<br />We're not gonna run.
3624454 3625622 How do we<br />turn this thing off?
3625705 3628499 On the fountain,<br />there should be two jugs.
3628583 3632420 Do you see them?<br />A five-gallon<br />and a three-gallon.
3632503 3636674 Fill one of the jugs<br />with exactly<br />four gallons of water.
3636758 3639510 Place it on the scale,<br />and the timer will stop.
3639594 3641012 You must be precise.
3641095 3644891 One ounce or more less<br />will result in detonation.
3644974 3647644 -If you're still alive<br />in five minutes, we'll speak.<br />-Wait! Wait a sec--
3647727 3652482 -(receiver clicks off)<br />-(computer ticking)
3652565 3655902 -I don't get it.<br />You get it?<br />-No.
3656861 3660031 Get the jugs.
3660114 3661407 Obviously, we can't<br />fill the three-gallon jug
3661491 3662867 with four gallons<br />of water, right?
3662950 3666120 -Obviously.<br />-All right, I know.<br />Here we go.
3666204 3669666 -We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?<br />-Uh-huh.
3669749 3672418 Okay, now,<br />we pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug,
3672502 3675129 giving us exactly three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug, right?
3675213 3677006 Right.<br />Then what?
3677090 3678841 Now,<br />take the three-gallon jug,
3678925 3680718 -fill that a third--<br />-No, no. He said be precise.
3680802 3682845 -Shit!<br />-Exactly four gallons.
3682929 3684722 Every cop in 50 miles<br />is runnin' his ass off,
3684806 3686140 and I'm playin'<br />kids' games in a park.
3686224 3690561 Hey! You want to focus<br />on the problem at hand?

3711791 3713042 -Pour that out.<br />-We can't start over.
3713126 3715044 -We can't start over.<br />-We're starting over.
3715128 3716087 Gimme the jug or I'm gonna<br />put my foot up your ass,<br />you dumb mother--

3718131 3720925 -You were gonna call me<br />a nigger, weren't you?<br />-No, I wasn't!
3721008 3724095 -Yes, you were.<br />What were you gonna call me?<br />-Asshole! How's that?
3724178 3726180 Asshole! You got some<br />fuckin' problem with me
3726264 3728725 'cause I'm white, Zeus?<br />Is that it?
3728808 3731728 Have I oppressed you?<br />Have I oppressed<br />your people somehow?
3731811 3734981 -You don't like me<br />'cause you're a racist!<br />-What?
3735064 3736858 You don't like me<br />'cause I'm white.
3736941 3738985 I don't like you because<br />you're gonna get me killed.
3739068 3741195 -How much time?<br />-(ticking continues)
3741279 3744115 Aw, shit!<br />We got less than a minute.<br />Throw this thing away.
3744198 3747952 We can't take it off of there.<br />It'll detonate. Just wait,<br />wait a second. Wait a second.
3750037 3752790 -I got it! Exactly<br />two gallons in here, right?<br />-Right.
3752874 3755126 -Leaving exactly one gallon<br />of empty space, right?<br />-Yeah.
3755209 3756961 A full five gallons here.
3757044 3759547 Pour one gallon out of<br />the five gallons into there,<br />we have--
3759630 3761758 -BOTH: Exactly four gallons!<br />-Yes!
3761841 3764135 Pour it in there. Come on.<br />Come on!
3764218 3767263 Don't spill it.<br />Don't spill it!
3767346 3770933 -Good, good, good.<br />Exactly four gallons.<br />-You did it, McClane.
3771017 3773269 -Put it on the thing!<br />Get it down there!<br />-Oh, shit! (gasps)
3773352 3776731 -(beeping)<br />-(laughing)
3776814 3779817 (phone ringing)
3781235 3784071 Congratulations.<br />You're still alive.
3784155 3786699 -Huh?<br />-Congratulations.
3786783 3787909 Yeah, we did it.
3787992 3790620 You surprise me again, John.
3790703 3792580 This is becoming<br />an ugly habit.
3792663 3795500 Yeah, well, I don't have<br />the time right now, Simon.<br />Listen.
3795583 3798085 Deal's a deal.<br />Where's the school bomb?
3798169 3801255 On the contrary,<br />you have lots of time.
3801339 3803758 You have...
3803841 3806928 two hours and 47 minutes<br />precisely.
3807011 3810473 -Plenty of time to test<br />those wits of yours.<br />-Hey! Hey!
3810556 3811933 Hey, listen, jerk-off!
3812016 3814811 Let me tell you somethin'.<br />I got a bad fuckin' hangover!
3814894 3817814 And I'm a little sick<br />of these fuckin' riddles!<br />Now, where is the school bomb?
3817897 3819023 Temper, John.
3819106 3822235 The road to truth<br />has many turns.
3822318 3825780 You will find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3825863 3827615 When you undertake<br />the trip it suggests,
3827698 3830117 ask yourself this question:
3830201 3833996 -What is 21 out of 42?<br />-(phone beeps off)
3836040 3839085 We're behind.<br />We should abandon<br />the rest and go.
3839168 3841712 Relax, Targo.<br />There's not a cop<br />for 20 blocks.
3841796 3846217 He's sending us to<br />the home team dugout<br />at Yankee Stadium. Why?
3846300 3849136 Well, we're the home team.<br />Are we supposed to find<br />something there?
3849220 3854225 -What's 21 out of 42?<br />-Twenty-one again.<br />Half of 42. Forty-two what?
3854308 3857687 -How many players are on<br />the Yankees ball club?<br />-Twenty-five.
3857770 3861107 -What else is 21?<br />Blackjack.<br />-It's a club.
3861190 3863943 It's a wild-goose chase<br />is what it is.
3864026 3865611 (panting)
3867905 3870199 Where's the nearest<br />"A" train?
3870283 3872034 Wait, wait, wait,<br />wait, wait.
3872118 3874120 You know,<br />some kid might find that.
3876163 3878791 You're right.
3882253 3886173 MAN: Come back here!<br />You little sons of bitches!
3886257 3888259 Hey, you!<br />I remember you!

3916829 3918873 Hey, hey, where are ya going?<br />Yankee Stadium's that way.
3918956 3920374 That's my bike,<br />you asshole!
3923419 3926923 (truck horn blaring)
3927006 3929884 Why don't ya just<br />run over everybody<br />in the whole street?
3929967 3932678 McClane, what the fuck<br />are we doing back down here?
3932762 3935348 Let me ask you somethin'.<br />What is it that<br />Wall Street doesn't have?
3935431 3937892 What, is this stuff catchin'?<br />You're talkin' in riddles.
3937975 3941896 No, no, stay with me!<br />What is it that Wall Street<br />does not have? Schools.
3941979 3945900 -And what is it<br />they have a shitload of?<br />-What?
3952198 3954325 I'll be back in a minute.
3954408 3957286 What am I supposed to do<br />with this?
3957370 3959956 McCLANE:<br />Give it to those guys<br />over there.
3960039 3961248 He's here.
3961332 3963334 Perhaps you could be<br />a little more specific.
3963417 3968005 McClane is here.<br />He's walking toward the bank.
3968089 3971300 And the black man<br />is coming toward me.
3971384 3977056 Oh, no, that's a pity.<br />And after we've gone to all<br />that trouble at the stadium.
3977139 3979141 Simon, kill him.
3979225 3983020 Stop toying with him<br />and kill him now.
3983104 3985147 Okay, so be it.
3985231 3990319 May he rest in peace.<br />I'll inform Karl in the lobby.
3990403 3993364 -You pack up your team<br />and get out of there.<br />-And this one?
3993447 3995199 Officer.
3998452 4001288 Yeah, I'm afraid<br />I'm gonna need an answer<br />on that issue.
4006836 4010256 -Let him go.<br />-Understood. Yes, sir?
4010339 4014176 (panting)<br />John McClane says<br />to give you this.
4014260 4017221 -(latches clicking)<br />-Wait, wait! Jesus!<br />Don't open it. It's a bomb.
4017304 4018889 -Another?<br />-Yeah?
4018973 4020391 Oh! I see. Um,
4020474 4022768 we'll take care of that.<br />We better move now.
4022852 4028107 Sir, thank you so much<br />for your assistance. We really<br />appreciate it. Thank you.
4029900 4033863 What are you doing?
4035114 4036907 I don't wanna ride with it.
4036991 4039243 Some kid could...
4039326 4042872 Put it in the back.
4047251 4050463 Hey! You-- You leavin'<br />this place unguarded?
4050546 4053090 (tires screeching)
4054091 4056302 (tires squealing)
4059555 4061307 I understand.
4061390 4063350 (alarm beeps)
4071817 4074195 -How ya doin'?<br />-All right.
4074278 4076947 John McClane, N.Y.P.D.
4077031 4079033 Are ya all right?
4079116 4081869 Yeah.<br />It's... laundry day.
4081952 4085164 What can I do for you,<br />Lieutenant?
4085247 4087750 Has it been quiet like this<br />all morning here?
4087833 4091212 -Well--<br />-Except for that big explosion<br />a couple of hours ago.
4091295 4093756 Have you seen anything strange<br />happen in the last hour or so?
4093839 4095299 No.
4095382 4097510 We've had cops in here pretty<br />steady since the subway thing.
4097593 4099720 Yeah, right.
4099804 4103349 We were just gonna make<br />a round on the vault floor<br />if you wanna tag along.
4103432 4105518 Sure, yeah.<br />I think I will.
4105601 4107103 What do you think of this heat<br />this late in the year?
4107186 4109522 Indian summer, huh?
4109605 4114777 Yeah, it feels like it's gonna<br />rain like dogs and cats later.<br />Here's one of your guys.
4114860 4117530 Detective, uh, Otto,<br />isn't it?
4117613 4120032 John McClane.
4122076 4124161 Mike, how ya doin'?
4126539 4130376 I keep tellin' myself<br />I'm gonna take the stairs<br />just for the exercise.
4130459 4135422 And on a hot day like this--<br />But it seems like I always<br />end up riding the lift.
4162241 4165202 Hey, what was the lottery<br />number last night? Huh?
4165286 4167913 You guys play<br />the lottery? No?
4167997 4170541 Uh, my wife buys me<br />two tickets every week.
4170624 4173169 For the last 10 years,<br />plays the same two numbers<br />all the time.
4173252 4175921 I said, "Honey, why don't<br />you play a different number?"
4176005 4179341 She says, "Well,<br />those are my lucky numbers."<br />I got the tickets right here.
4182469 4186640 McCLANE:<br />Put that fuckin' gun down!<br />Put the fuckin' gun down now!
4186724 4190060 -(grunting,<br />punches landing)<br />-(yelling in German)
4191061 4194440 -(German)<br />-Put it down!
4194523 4196984 (gunshots)
4197067 4199612 (gunshot)
4199695 4202031 Hello?
4202114 4204283 Anybody down here?
4204366 4207494 -(elevator bell rings)<br />-(groaning)
4213083 4214418 (metal clangs)
4214501 4216587 Put your hands up!<br />Put your fuckin' hands up now!
4216670 4219340 No, John!<br />No, no, God, it's me!
4221508 4224428 -Jesus Christ, you almost<br />gave me a heart attack.<br />-You all right?
4224511 4226263 -Huh?<br />-You all right?
4226347 4227514 Yeah, yeah,<br />it's not my blood.
4227598 4228974 What the hell's<br />goin' on down here?
4229058 4232102 Go take a look<br />in there.
4253624 4257294 Hey, McClane.<br />Where the hell is everybody?
4257378 4260714 Simon "fuckin'" says!
4260798 4264176 I should've seen it<br />comin' a mile away.<br />This was never about revenge.
4264260 4265344 It's about<br />a goddamn heist.
4265427 4267471 What was in the room?
4267554 4269306 -This.<br />-(metal clangs)
4269390 4273018 What is this? Oh, shit!<br />Is this gold?
4273102 4274353 -Yeah, it's gold.<br />-Damn, this is heavy!
4274436 4276563 They cleaned out<br />a whole room of this?
4276647 4280985 -Yeah.<br />-You know, that would've taken<br />like a-a tank or a, uh, uh--
4281068 4283195 A dump truck.
4283279 4285197 Fourteen great big<br />dump trucks.
4285281 4287491 -We almost got hit<br />by a dump truck.<br />-Shit!
4287574 4289743 Damn! Slow down!<br />Shit!
4289827 4291704 -Put that shit down.<br />-No fuckin' way.
4291787 4293998 -They ain't gonna<br />let you keep it.<br />-Yeah, yeah, we'll see.
4294081 4296208 -We're gonna need a car.<br />-A car?
4302089 4304383 -You know how<br />to hot-wire this thing?<br />-Of course I can.
4304466 4308095 I'm an electrician.<br />Only problem is--
4308178 4311473 (engine sputtering,<br />starting)
4311557 4313517 Takes too fuckin' long.
4318731 4321692 (horn honking)
4325696 4326655 McCLANE:<br />They're not on the bridge.
4326739 4330242 Down there, McClane.<br />The F.D.R.
4330326 4332619 (truck horns honking)
4332703 4335331 Let's go, let's go!<br />Come on!
4335414 4337249 Aw, shit!
4337333 4340127 -What?<br />-They shot the phone.
4340210 4342713 Aw, too bad. Come on.<br />What's 21 out of 42?
4342796 4345466 -I don't have a clue.<br />-What about Yankee Stadium?
4345549 4348552 We'll get there.<br />But that son of a bitch is not<br />gettin' off on Manhattan!
4348635 4350095 -(horn honking)<br />-Jesus Christ!
4350179 4352473 Who do you think you are,<br />lady, Hillary Clinton?
4352556 4355225 That's it! Hillary Clinton!<br />The 42nd president.
4355309 4359438 -She'd be the 43rd president.<br />-All right. Who's the 21st?
4359521 4361482 -I don't know.<br />-You don't know?
4361565 4363817 -No, I don't know.<br />Do you know?<br />-No!
4363901 4367488 Well? What kinda engine<br />does this piece of shit have?<br />Come on, step on it!
4367571 4370366 It's a Yugo.<br />It's built for<br />economy, not speed.
4372576 4375662 -Whoa! What are ya doin'?<br />-I'm gonna get us<br />another phone.
4375746 4379458 -(horn honking)<br />-(tires screeching)
4379541 4382753 Wait, wait, wait. Hey!<br />Who was the 21st president?
4382836 4384546 Go fuck yourself!
4386173 4387716 That guy was pissed.
4387800 4390636 He'll feel better when<br />he looks in the backseat.
4390719 4392388 Oh, shit,<br />that was my gold bar!
4392471 4395391 This is McClane.<br />Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.
4395474 4398227 -John, where the hell are you?<br />-Walter, it's not a revenge.<br />It's a heist.
4398310 4400771 -What?<br />-There's gold in<br />the Federal Reserve,
4400854 4403232 and they took<br />a shitload of it.
4403315 4405734 -They're headed north<br />in dump trucks.<br />-Have you been drinking?
4405818 4408487 No, not since this morning.
4408570 4411240 Listen, there's a line<br />of dump trucks northbound<br />on the F.D.R. at about 70th.
4411323 4414034 You gotta close the bridge<br />and get some helicopters<br />over there right away.
4414118 4416703 I couldn't close<br />a hot dog stand right now.
4416787 4419832 I'm spread all over hell.<br />What about this damn bomb?
4419915 4422126 Find out who the 21st<br />president was. It's got<br />something to do with this.
4422209 4424169 John! John,<br />the 21st what?
4424253 4428298 -Walter? Shit! Goddamn<br />cellular fuckin' phones!<br />-(banging phone)
4428382 4430175 -Get hold of Munson<br />in Triborough.<br />-Inspector.
4430259 4433303 Tell him to close<br />all the East River bridges<br />north of 59th street.
4433387 4435597 -Lookin' for dump trucks.<br />-Dump trucks?
4435681 4437224 McClane says there are<br />dump trucks
4437307 4439518 headed up the F.D.R.<br />loaded with gold.
4439601 4442521 Walter, they don't allow<br />dump trucks on the F.D.R.!
4442604 4445190 -Connie!<br />-All right! You don't<br />want I should argue,
4445274 4447526 I won't argue,<br />no matter how stupid it is.
4447609 4451071 K-9, bring it<br />around to the back.<br />Check out the boiler room.
4451155 4452614 COBB:<br />Find anything, Charlie?
4452698 4454324 I could spend a week in here<br />with an X-ray machine
4454408 4455409 and still not find it.
4455492 4458245 You don't have a week.
4458328 4459913 You got five more minutes, then<br />we're movin' up to 86th street.
4459997 4461915 We're goin'<br />as fast as we can.
4461999 4463917 What's up?
4464001 4467171 McClane was mentioning<br />something about the<br />Federal Reserve Building.
4467254 4469673 Isn't that right near<br />that Wall Street bomb site<br />we just left?
4469756 4470799 Yeah.
4475846 4479433 MAN (on walkie-talkie):<br />How long do you want us<br />to stay here?
4479516 4481852 The men at the stadium,<br />stay or go?
4481935 4484646 -Karl should have<br />checked in by now.<br />-(phone ringing)
4484730 4486648 TARGO:<br />Moment.
4486732 4490194 (ringing)
4490277 4492654 (ringing continues)
4492738 4497326 -Come on, come on.<br />-(ringing continues)
4497409 4500454 Stay where you are.<br />McClane may still turn up.
4500537 4503332 Relax, Targo.<br />If he is still alive...
4503415 4504374 (touch tones)
4504458 4507252 he won't be talking<br />to anyone.
4507336 4509379 It's the next turnoff.
4509463 4512925 Hi, it's Elvis Duran.<br />You're on the air.<br />What's up?
4513008 4515928 SIMON: First of all,<br />I just wanna tell you<br />what a great show you got.
4516011 4517513 I listen to you all the time.
4517596 4519348 Thank you, thank you.<br />What do you wanna talk about?
4519431 4521725 You know all those cop cars<br />screaming around everywhere?
4521808 4523352 You know what they're up to?
4523435 4527773 There's a bomb in a school.<br />My cousin's a cop.
4527856 4530734 -Here you go, my dear.<br />-SIMON: Somebody put a big<br />bomb in a school somewhere.
4530817 4532736 Only they don't know<br />which one.
4532819 4535489 -So they're searching<br />all of them.<br />-(counting)
4535572 4538492 -Shh.<br />-Every school in<br />the metropolitan area.
4538575 4540744 Holy shit!
4540827 4543914 -Doris, can you get<br />a hold of my wife?<br />-Annie?
4543997 4546333 -(phones ringing)<br />-Turley!
4546416 4549419 Half the goddamn city<br />just called 911!
4550921 4552881 They're gone.
4552965 4554800 -What?<br />-They're gone!
4554883 4556385 Who is this guy? Houdini?

4604433 4606310 Where you takin'<br />this truck?
4606393 4608020 The aqueduct.

4611023 4613984 No, the aqueduct. The aque--<br />The water aqueduct!
4614067 4615652 Aqueduct?
4617904 4622451 TRUCK DRIVER: See?<br />It goes from here all the way<br />out to the Catskill Mountains.
4622534 4627372 -What does?<br />-That! The water pipe!<br />Goes for about 60 miles!
4633378 4635547 -Hey, you the foreman?<br />-MAN: Yeah.
4635631 4639801 N.Y.P.D. You had any extra<br />dump trucks come through here<br />in the last couple of minutes?
4639885 4642262 I'm gonna write<br />those fuckin' clowns up.
4642346 4644640 They better start payin'<br />attention to work orders,<br />or I'm gonna kick some butt.
4644723 4648810 -Who you talkin' about?<br />-The dozen idiots<br />who tore ass up the tube!
4648894 4650937 We're not loadin' up there.<br />We're loadin' over here!
4651021 4653398 So much for bridges<br />and helicopters.
4653482 4656652 -You got a map showin' me<br />where this tunnel goes?<br />-Yeah, right here.
4659571 4660989 We run pretty much<br />up under the Saw Mill
4661073 4662991 until you get<br />up to the Coffer Dam.
4663075 4665786 From there on, we've already<br />brought the water down<br />from the reservoir.
4665869 4668246 Any way to get<br />in or outta there?
4668330 4670374 Yeah. There's a vent shaft<br />every two miles.
4670457 4672250 -No, I mean with a truck?<br />-At the Coffer Dam.
4672334 4673752 You can get<br />a truck in there.
4673835 4675629 You can get there<br />on the surface.
4675712 4677881 Just follow<br />Saw Mill River Parkway.<br />It's about 20 miles.
4677964 4679800 I'm gonna meet you<br />right there, all right?
4679883 4681593 Wait, what am I<br />supposed to do?
4681677 4682761 You're gonna go up<br />to Yankee Stadium.
4682844 4684763 McClane.
4684846 4688517 -Go! Get outta here!<br />We got less than two hours.<br />-Goddamn it!
4693605 4695899 Hey! Is somethin' wrong?
4695982 4698860 TRUCK DRIVER: 480 yards<br />of rock moved so far.
4698944 4700904 Now, that's 10 times<br />the Hoover Dam.
4700987 4705534 Right now, there's 516 feet<br />of rock above our heads.
4705617 4708370 This part is phase three<br />of tunnel three.
4708453 4711331 Planning for it<br />began back in 1954,
4711415 4713959 but construction didn't begin<br />till June of 1970.
4714042 4716878 You know what<br />the most interesting part<br />of tunnel three is?
4716962 4719506 -What's that, Jerry?<br />-The valves. Each one--
4726054 4729850 -A big departure from<br />tunnels one and two.<br />-(horn honking)
4729933 4734479 -(honking)<br />-Come on! What a hell<br />of a place to break down.
4734563 4736773 Hold it a minute, Jerry.<br />Let me have your hard hat.
4736857 4739484 -You got a jacket?<br />-Yeah, yeah, yeah, here.
4739568 4741611 Wait here a minute.
4741695 4744823 Wait until he gets<br />alongside the door.
4744906 4748535 Hey, fellas. Mickey O'Brien,<br />aqueduct security.
4748618 4751747 Hey, listen, we got a report<br />of a guy comin' through here<br />with eight reindeer--

4760964 4764426 jolly, old, fat guy<br />with a snowy white beard.
4764509 4766470 Cute little<br />red-and-white suit.
4766553 4768555 I'm surprised<br />you didn't see him.
4770807 4774060 What is it with you guys<br />and these phones?
4774144 4776730 This'll gimme somethin'.
4776813 4780025 -Holy shit!<br />Is that guy dead?<br />-(patting body)
4780108 4783737 -Yes, Jerry.<br />I'm afraid he is.<br />-Jesus Christ!
4783820 4787657 Yeah. I want you to get<br />ahold of a guy named Cobb.
4787741 4791536 Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.<br />He's the head of<br />my police unit.
4791620 4795207 Get him down here.<br />Find him. Tell him<br />you were with John McClane.
4795290 4799044 -Tell him to find out<br />who the 21st president was.<br />-Chester A. Arthur.
4799127 4801797 -What?<br />-Chester A. Arthur.
4801880 4806009 1881 to 1885.<br />Nominated Vice President<br />in 1880.
4806092 4809554 Did you know he was<br />collector of customs<br />right here in New York?
4809638 4813683 No, I didn't know that, Jerry.<br />Take care of yourself.
4843797 4845173 Now?
4845257 4848176 No, there's only one of them.
4863400 4865068 Yes or no?
4871032 4873159 No!
4873243 4875203 We'll follow him.
4877038 4879833 TV's got us. TV's got us.<br />We gotta release<br />these traffic guys.
4879916 4882210 No, traffic jams<br />we can take care of later.
4882294 4885005 -You find out what the hell<br />is wrong with this thing!<br />-The frequencies are jammed.
4885088 4887215 -What about Ricky?<br />-I don't know.<br />I can't get ahold of him.
4887299 4889885 -But, Walter,<br />Federal Reserve.<br />-Yeah?
4889968 4893179 Biggest gold storage<br />in the world.
4893263 4895515 You get a unit<br />back down there.<br />Find Ricky.
4895599 4897017 Find out what<br />the hell is goin' on.
4897100 4898768 -Walter!<br />-Yeah?
4898852 4900729 You gotta hear this.
4902314 4904858 (object smacking window)
4904941 4906693 Christ, I thought we were<br />going in the back way!
4906776 4908737 This is the back way,<br />Walter.
4908820 4913158 In half an hour,<br />you're gonna have a riot<br />at every school in this city.
4914743 4918246 (crowd shouting)
4918330 4921917 COBB:<br />We'll start at the top floor.<br />Put 20 men on each floor.
4922000 4924336 Send the other 50 men<br />down to the basement with us.
4924419 4927255 -What about McClane?<br />-Not a word. I'm getting<br />nothing but busy signals.
4927339 4929257 Westchester's probably<br />worse than we are.
4929341 4931217 This is kinda puttin'<br />all our eggs in one basket.
4931301 4932636 What if McClane's wrong?
4932719 4933803 -Walter.<br />-Yeah?
4933887 4934930 This is Principal Martinez.
4935013 4936139 Principal Martinez,<br />Inspector Cobb.
4936222 4937599 How do you do, Inspector?
4937682 4938767 How do you do,<br />Principal Martinez?
4938850 4940977 I don't want to alarm<br />your children.
4941061 4943229 I wonder if you could move them<br />all into the auditorium<br />and keep them calm.
4961247 4965168 TARGO:<br />We are coming to the dam.<br />You can call the rear guard.
4970423 4974344 Rear guard,<br />you can close up now.
4974427 4979349 We've reached the dam.<br />You can come up now.<br />Nils?
4979432 4983353 You can close in now!<br />Nils!
4983436 4985897 Attention! Attention!<br />Nils is dead.
4985981 4989859 I repeat, Nils is dead,<br />fuck-head. So's his pal.
4989943 4993822 And those four guys<br />from the East German All-Stars,<br />your boys down at the bank,
4993905 4995240 they're gonna be<br />a little late.
4995323 4998785 John.
4998868 5000286 In the back of the truck<br />you're driving,
5000370 5004207 there's $13 billion<br />worth in gold bullion.
5004290 5006209 I wonder, would a deal<br />be out of the question?
5006292 5007877 Yeah, I got a deal for you.
5007961 5009796 Crawl out from under that rock<br />you're hiding under,
5009879 5011673 and I'll drive this truck<br />up your ass.
5011756 5014217 How colorful.
5020849 5023059 TARGO:<br />I told you not to<br />toy with him!
5023143 5025103 Thank you.<br />That's very helpful.
5028189 5031234 You've jeopardized the mission<br />and the contract!
5031317 5033445 (speaking German)
5033528 5036239 We are vulnerable<br />till we reach the ship.
5036322 5038199 I'm going to put<br />an end to this.
5039784 5042078 Stop!
5044122 5046291 Targo! Targo!

5051296 5053214 We drown him.
5053298 5056217 (speaking German)
5064267 5065810 Walter!
5065894 5067771 Take a look at this.
5067854 5071691 Janitor said this one<br />was delivered this morning.<br />About 10:30, right?
5071775 5074778 -Not hooked up.<br />-Yeah?
5074861 5077363 Okay. Now, take a look<br />at the front.
5079115 5082160 We drill the hinges.<br />Get everybody out.

5269472 5272475 (beeping)
5277647 5281484 Well, I'd say<br />you could call off<br />your search.
5281567 5284320 -Can you stop it?<br />-I shouldn't even<br />touch it.
5284404 5287282 Who knows what kind of<br />booby traps this thing's got.
5287365 5288408 What about the code?
5288491 5291119 -No word.<br />-When do we evacuate?
5291202 5294372 -Simon says he sees one kid<br />leave the building, boom!<br />-Fine, there's a chance

5366069 5370573 Hi, kids. I know you usually<br />have assembly on Fridays,<br />but today is special.
5370656 5373701 Mr. Lambert here is<br />from the fire department,
5373785 5378331 and today<br />he wants us to practice<br />a brand-new fire drill.
5378414 5382085 So, I want you to divide<br />in half, and I want half of you<br />to go over here--
5382168 5385338 -teachers will help them--<br />and line up against the wall.<br />-Open the door.

5390468 5393554 All right?<br />Everybody up, please.<br />Teachers, please help them.
5393638 5397183 Fire drill, my ass!<br />That guy ain't from<br />the fire department.
5397266 5399018 Maybe it's 'cause of<br />the radio.
5399102 5402188 You mean like they're<br />after us? Nah.
5402271 5405400 -Tony squealed on us.<br />-No, he didn't.
5405483 5409278 -Come on!<br />-Well, where you going?
5411697 5415785 Let me drive!<br />Let me drive!<br />Goddamn it!
5415868 5418788 -(horns honking)<br />-Why the hell didn't you<br />tell me before?
5418871 5421707 -Of course he put the bomb<br />up in that school.<br />-Why would he do that?
5421791 5423543 Make sure he got<br />your complete attention!
5424752 5426462 (gunshots continue)
5427880 5430133 -Jesus! Jesus!<br />-Find the fuse panel!
5430216 5432635 -What?<br />-The fuse panel! Where's<br />the fuse panel to this car?
5432718 5435221 -It's right here! Right here!<br />-Pull out the anti-lock brakes<br />fuse.
5435304 5438558 -Shit, I don't know<br />which one it is.<br />-Well, then yank 'em all out.
5438641 5441144 -There.<br />-Put your head fuckin' down.<br />Put your head fuckin' down.
5441227 5442478 This is gonna be really bad.
5442562 5444647 -(gunshots continue)<br />-Listen to me.
5444730 5446399 Hang the fuck on, all right?
5467795 5470339 (engine dies)
5472467 5475094 Oh,<br />what the fuck happened?
5475178 5477555 (groans)<br />You got a "Triple A" card?
5477638 5479891 -PRINCIPAL MARTINEZ:<br />Keep moving. Keep moving.<br />-Excuse me.
5479974 5482268 I got the janitors making<br />a last sweep of the building<br />right now.
5482351 5484520 Thank you, Ms. Martinez.
5501829 5503706 -Come on.<br />-(laughs)
5503789 5507251 (chattering)

5512048 5514634 (horns honking)
5518846 5520765 Oh, man!
5523518 5525561 -What the fuck are you doin'?<br />-Interrogatin' him.
5525645 5527772 What's he gonna tell you,<br />"I'm dead"?
5527855 5529690 I ain't gonna know<br />till I ask him.
5529774 5532735 Go around and see<br />if there's any aspirins<br />in that glove box.
5532818 5535154 No way.<br />You do it.
5535238 5537657 (coins jingling)
5541661 5543663 Ten quarters.
5543746 5546165 The guy in the dump truck<br />had 10 quarters.
5546249 5549835 -Exactly ten quarters.<br />-Well, maybe they were making<br />long-distance phone calls.
5549919 5552505 No.<br />It's for the bridge.
5552588 5554840 -What?<br />-It's for the toll<br />on the bridge.
5557260 5559345 ZEUS: There, there!<br />Down on the wharf!
5559428 5562473 Dump trucks!<br />Right there! Right there!
5562557 5566602 -(horns honking)<br />-Christ, they got it loaded<br />on a ship already.
5568354 5570523 Shit!<br />How 'bout the Coast Guard?
5570606 5572608 -McCLANE: It'd take 'em<br />an hour to get here.<br />-Shit!
5572692 5574777 Shit!

6237397 6239441 Hello, John McClane.
6239524 6243195 (sighs)<br />There was never any bomb<br />in the school, was there?
6243278 6245822 Of course not.
6245906 6248200 I'm a soldier,<br />not a monster.
6248283 6251119 Even though I sometimes<br />work for monsters.
6251203 6255415 No. The real bomb<br />is on this ship.
6258919 6261505 Coast Guard.
6261588 6263924 I was tellin' 'em<br />where the boat was.
6264007 6266426 (chuckles)<br />Game over, huh?
6266510 6269554 Not quite over.
6269638 6273058 Bridgeport Coast Guard,<br />come in, please.
6273141 6277813 -They put you on hold?<br />-(chuckles) She told me<br />to stay on the line.
6277896 6280107 (laughing)
6280190 6284027 (chuckling)<br />Oh, God, I love this country.
6284111 6287614 You know, your brother<br />was an asshole.
6287698 6291159 -He really was an asshole.<br />-(laughs) He was--<br />He was an asshole.
6291243 6294997 You got his number, yeah.<br />Yeah, okay.
6297040 6301336 Forgive me. Would you<br />help Mr. McClane below?
6301420 6304214 -(groaning)<br />-Careful now.
6305340 6309177 Now, do you have<br />the communiqué?
6309261 6312139 -Bridgeport Radio.<br />Come in, please, Bridgeport.<br />-WOMAN: Coast Guard.
6312222 6314182 -Are you there, dear?<br />-Yes, we're here.
6314266 6317519 -Do you have the ability<br />to record a message?<br />-Yes.
6317602 6320981 -Then please begin now.<br />-All right.
6325652 6328989 SIMON'S VOICE:<br />This is a communiqué<br />from the C.R.F.
6329072 6332826 For too long, the West<br />has conspired to steal<br />the wealth of the world,
6332909 6336079 consigning<br />the balance of humanity<br />to economic starvation.
6336163 6339333 Today, we will level<br />the playing field.
6339416 6342336 In a few minutes, the contents<br />of the Federal Reserve Bank,
6342419 6345630 the gold your economies<br />are built on,
6345714 6347966 will be redistributed<br />by explosive
6348050 6350302 across the bottom<br />of the Long Island Sound.
6352304 6355599 If you are not in gridlock,<br />I invite you to come<br />and watch.
6360520 6363565 -You're gonna blow it all up?<br />-SIMON: That's the idea.
6363648 6366151 There are some gentlemen<br />in the Middle East<br />who seem to think
6366234 6368403 that they'll make<br />a great deal of money.
6368487 6370030 See the men<br />safely off the ship,
6370113 6373408 and I'll see you in<br />the port-side launch.
6373492 6375952 ZEUS:<br />What the hell's all this<br />got to do with killin' McClane?
6377537 6379456 Life has its little bonuses.
6379539 6382584 Didn't I hear you say<br />you didn't even<br />like your brother?
6382667 6385420 There's a difference between<br />not liking one's brother and<br />not caring
6385504 6388173 when some dumb Irish flatfoot<br />drops him out of a window.
6388256 6390258 Hey, I didn't even know<br />that motherfucker!
6390342 6392386 Yes, and I never invited you<br />aboard the ship.
6392469 6394388 ZEUS:<br />No riddle is gonna stop<br />this motherfucker?
6394471 6398016 No code, no riddle,<br />no fancy little countdown.
6398100 6401269 Hey, fuck-head.<br />Yeah, you, fuck-head.
6403021 6405482 There's just one thing<br />I gotta know.
6405565 6408151 You got any aspirins?
6408235 6410904 I've had a bad fuckin'<br />headache all day long.
6412406 6415992 (chuckling)<br />Must be your lucky day.
6416076 6420080 -(laughing)<br />-Keep the bottle.<br />(German)
6431091 6434344 Where is the gold?
6434428 6437431 He's betrayed us.
6437514 6440350 -The containers<br />are filled with that.<br />-(metal clanging)
6463498 6466126 (Man speaking German)
6468795 6471298 -(German)<br />-(German)
6472841 6474176 If I hadn't have saved<br />your fuckin' ass,
6474259 6475635 I wouldn't<br />be sittin' here with you
6475719 6478096 about to blow up with<br />$100 billion in fuckin' gold!
6478180 6480390 Yeah, well, I got<br />some bad news. You're only<br />gonna blow up with me.
6480474 6482726 -What?<br />-There's no gold<br />on this boat.
6482809 6485520 -How do you know that?<br />-'Cause I know the man,<br />I know the family.
6485604 6488106 The only thing better<br />than blowin' up<br />$100 billion worth of gold
6488190 6489900 is makin' people<br />think you did.
6489983 6491485 -Yeah, well, where is it?<br />-I don't know.
6491568 6493528 He must've have switched it<br />back on the dock somewhere.
6493612 6496656 -Oh, yeah. That's supposed<br />to make me feel better?<br />-No.
6496740 6499117 You're wrong about<br />the other thing, though.<br />You're not gonna die.
6499201 6502078 You know some cop trick<br />about handcuffs that's gonna<br />get us outta this?
6502162 6504372 Yeah, use a key.
6504456 6505373 You know how to<br />pick this lock?
6505457 6507459 Is this some<br />black shit again?
6507542 6510504 Will you stop with<br />that racial shit? Are you<br />a fuckin' locksmith or not?
6510587 6512714 Yeah, yeah, I can do it if<br />I had somethin' to do it with.
6512797 6514591 How 'bout a splinter<br />of that cable I slid down?
6514674 6517135 That might work.
6517219 6521389 -(grunting) Hold on.<br />-What the fuck are you doin'?
6522390 6524518 (groans)
6524601 6527354 Oh, fuck!<br />Shit!
6527437 6528647 How's that?<br />That big enough?
6528730 6530690 Shit, yeah,<br />that might work.
6530774 6534110 All right, then I'm gonna<br />drop it in your hands.<br />Cup your hand.
6534194 6536071 Don't drop this<br />motherfucker, all right?
6536154 6537197 Get-- All right, come on.
6537280 6539157 -Ya ready? Ready?<br />-One,
6539241 6541243 two-- Spit it.
6541326 6542702 -Yeah!<br />-Get it?
6542786 6544579 Come on, come on.<br />Move your hands.
6544663 6547582 All right, okay.
6547666 6550168 Damn, McClane, you know,<br />I was just startin' to like you.
6550252 6551628 Yeah, well, don't.<br />I'm an asshole.
6551711 6553713 What are you<br />talkin' about now?
6553797 6556633 -I lied to you, Zeus.<br />-About what?
6556716 6560762 -Remember I said Weiss found<br />that bomb up in Harlem?<br />-Yeah.
6560845 6562722 -They found it in Chinatown.<br />-Now that's low,
6562806 6564349 even for a white motherfucker<br />like you.
6564432 6567143 I told you<br />I was an asshole.
6567227 6569563 -(alarm beeping)<br />-What the fuck was that?
6569646 6572315 I don't know.
6572399 6575193 -It was the only way I could<br />get you to come with me.<br />-Uh-huh.
6575277 6577195 -You got a wife, McClane?<br />-Yeah.
6577279 6578697 I'm surprised anybody<br />would stay with you
6578780 6580323 long enough to be married.
6580407 6581741 Well, she didn't<br />stick around too long.
6581825 6583159 We're sort of separated.
6583243 6585203 What the fuck is<br />"sort of separated"?
6585287 6587747 Well, she was in L.A.,<br />I was in New York.
6587831 6591543 We had a fight<br />on the phone, she hung up.<br />I didn't call her back.
6591626 6592669 How long ago was that?
6592752 6595255 (sighs)<br />About a year ago now.
