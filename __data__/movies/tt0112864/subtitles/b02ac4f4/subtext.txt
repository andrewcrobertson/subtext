114197 118910 Alan - bomb squad, special services,<br />state police and the FBI.
118952 122747 Lieutenant Jergenson, Hugh Palmer -<br />go to St John's Emergency
122789 125667 in case we got any walk-ins from the street.
125709 130463 Kramer, get the city engineers. I got to find<br />out the damage report. It's important.
130505 133216 Bonwit Teller.<br />Who'd blow up a department store?
133258 135260 Ever see a woman miss a shoe sale?
135301 137679 Connie, get started on a witness sheet.
137721 141224 Ricky, you and Joe make sure<br />the uniforms got it cordoned off.
141266 144853 And you don't let the damn TV crews in.<br />Benson?
144894 146563 - Inspector? Phone.<br />- Not now.
146604 151943 Benson - traffic. We get Fifth Avenue cleared<br />up by 3:00 or we got the traffic jam from hell.
151985 153695 - Walter!<br />- Yeah?
153737 157323 I think you'd better take this.
159159 161411 Major Case Unit. Inspector Cobb.
161453 166041 Said Simple Simon to the pieman<br />going to the fair, "Give me your pies,
166082 168877 or I'll cave your head in."
168918 172422 You see, Bonwit's was just<br />to make sure I had your attention.
172464 175884 Is there a detective named McClane there?
175925 180972 - He's on suspension.<br />- No, Walter, he's not. Not today.
181014 183725 - Who is this?<br />- Call me Simon.
183767 186853 - What do you want?<br />- I want to play a game.
186895 190273 - What kind of game?<br />- Simon Says.
191316 193943 Simon will tell Lieutenant McClane<br />what to do,
193985 197405 and Lieutenant McClane is going to do it.
197447 202577 - Noncompliance will result in a penalty.<br />- What penalty?
202619 206122 Another big bang in a very public place.
208583 211544 What is it that you want<br />Lieutenant McClane to do?
211586 217050 Simon says Lieutenant McClane is to go to<br />the corner of 138th Street <i>und </i>Amsterdam.
217092 221638 - Which is in Harlem, if I'm not mistaken.<br />- Kowalski! Lambert!
221680 225850 - Do you know where to find McClane?<br />- I doubt you'll find him in church.
225892 230855 Well, you better find out<br />what rock he's under and kick it over.
242701 245203 John?
245245 246705 Thanks.
253712 256006 Gimme some more. Come on.
257507 260635 Jesus, John. You look like shit.
264889 267600 Where did we leave off with that roster?
267642 271271 Well, we got three killings<br />in Red Hook the past two nights.
271312 275692 Put Miner on it. And Genetti.<br />The mayor's office'll call later today.
275734 280530 Next, 14 dump trucks stolen<br />from a yard in Staten Island.
280572 284868 14? Jesus. Is somebody startin'<br />a construction company?
284909 289622 Nah, it was John's landlady<br />gonna clean his apartment.
289664 292083 Insurance fraud.
292125 295337 The trucks are probably<br />already out in California.
295378 299883 The contractor splits the money with the<br />thieves. We had it out in Jersey a while ago.
299924 302427 See what Kelly can do with it.
303470 307932 - What was the lottery number last night?<br />- 4667.
309726 312937 - Still bettin' your badge, Rick?<br />- Yeah.
312979 316316 6991 every week.
316358 318693 6991. Lucky number.
318735 321696 Half the cops in New York play their badges.
321738 324949 How are the kids, John?
324991 327702 I hear they're OK.
327744 330288 Did you talk with Holly?
332957 336503 - No, I didn't talk to Holly.<br />- Comin' up on it, Inspector.
337921 340340 Is it hot in here or am I just scared to death?
340382 343051 You wanna make sure the gun's secure?
343885 346012 Yeah, it's good.
353186 356022 You're the first woman since Holly<br />to see me do this.
356064 359484 - I'm honoured.<br />- Yeah.
359526 361736 So was she.
363738 367242 So, where's the backup gonna be?
370203 373456 We're gonna drop back to 128th Street.
374082 375959 What?
376001 379087 Ten blocks? Are you fuckin' kiddin' me?
379129 382382 Man, that's just great.<br />Walter, what is all this about?
382424 385427 If we don't do what he says,<br />he'll blow up a public place.
385468 388847 - Why me? What's he got to do with me?<br />- I have no idea.
388888 391349 He just said it had to be you.
392767 395603 It's nice to be needed.
395645 400442 - Frankly, you haven't been much...<br />- Mind your fuckin' business about Holly.
400483 404320 You and Simon are fuckin' up<br />a perfectly good hangover.
407073 408950 OK.
418293 421296 We'll be back to pick you up in 15 minutes.
421338 424716 Take your time. I expect to be dead in four.
425300 427135 Let's go, Billy.
449657 451534 Man.
478353 481606 - Yo, Uncle.<br />- Come look at this.
482899 486695 - Why aren't you in school?<br />- Tony wants to sell you this.
486736 489906 Tony? That no-neck dude they call Bad T?
489948 491991 He says he found it in a dumpster.
492033 494619 He keeps stealin', they'll find him in one.
494661 497747 He didn't steal it.<br />He says his uncle gave it to him.
499249 501835 Hand me that newspaper over there.
503503 507632 Don't ever let people use you.<br />You're runnin' around with stolen property.
507674 511553 If you get caught, you get in trouble,<br />while he denies it and walks away.
511594 515515 You mean, you want us<br />to take it back to Tony?
515557 519936 No. I'll take it back to Tony, with a message.
519978 522647 - Now, where you goin'?<br />- School.
522689 524399 - Why?<br />- To get educated.
524441 526609 - Why?<br />- So we can go to college.
526651 528945 - Why is that important?<br />- To get 'espect.
528987 531072 Respect. Now, who's the bad guys?
531114 533658 - Guys who sell drugs.<br />- Guys who have guns.
533700 535910 - And who's the good guys?<br />- We are.
535952 537996 - Who's gonna help you?<br />- Nobody.
538038 540498 - So who's gonna help you?<br />- We help ourselves.
540540 542917 - Who do we not want to help us?<br />- White people.
542959 545795 That's right.
545837 549299 Now get on outta here. Go to school.
553053 555513 - Uncle, you better come look at this.<br />- What?
555555 558683 - There's a white man standing in the street.<br />- I seen one.
558725 560643 Not like this.
570320 576117 Dial 911. Tell the police to get up here quick.<br />Somebody's about to get killed.
576159 579120 - Then get your butts to school, you hear me?<br />- Yeah.
579162 581247 All right.
605730 609484 - Morning.<br />- Good morning.
609526 613113 You havin' a nice day, sir?<br />You feelin' all right?
613154 615156 Not to get too personal,
615198 619577 but a white man standing in Harlem<br />wearin' a sign that says "I hate niggers"
619619 624624 has either got some serious personal issues<br />or not all his dogs are barkin'.
624666 627419 Hey. I'm talkin' to you.
627460 630296 You got about ten seconds<br />before those guys see you.
630338 633258 When they do, they will kill you.<br />You understand?
633299 637095 You are about to have a very bad day.
637137 641808 Tell me about it. Sir, this is a police matter.<br />For your own safety...
641850 646688 Damn right it is. For your own safety, hide<br />your butt in my shop till the police get here.
646730 649107 What the fuck...?
650650 653403 Oh, shit.
660035 664873 I'm a cop. I'm on a case. Somebody blew up<br />Bonwit Teller's. Did you hear about that?
664914 669419 The asshole that did that said I had to do this,<br />or he's gonna blow up somethin' else.
669461 670712 Shit, shit, shit.
670754 672630 - I got a gun.<br />- They got ten guns.
672672 676843 Look, start acting crazy.<br />Like loony tunes, you know? Like Bellevue.
676885 681473 - Hey, Zeus. This a friend of yours?<br />- He look like a friend of mine?
681514 686895 I think the dude just escaped from<br />some hospital, you know? Like Bellevue.
689773 694110 I am the voice of my own god.
694152 696154 And my god...
696196 701659 I told the librarian that I had a bad headache,<br />but she didn't believe me. I really do, though.
701701 705580 - My head does not feel good.<br />- Shut the fuck up.
705622 708833 You've made a very bad mistake.
710418 712420 Cut that shit off.
712462 717759 Fellas, fellas. Nature Boy here hates niggers.<br />Now what are we gonna do about that?
718259 720595 Yo, yo, hold up, hold up...
720637 721888 Shit.
725892 728061 Back! Back up.
728937 731147 Back the fuck up. Now!
732357 734192 Come on, man, get up.
735443 737612 Get outta here.
737654 741366 - Stop the cab. Stop the goddamn cab.<br />- Don't shoot me.
741408 743326 Get up. Come on, get up.
743368 746496 Back up. I don't want to, but I will.<br />You know I will.
746538 748123 Come on. Drive.
748164 750875 - Drive! Go! Go!<br />- Get the fuck outta here.
750917 753378 Drive. Drive.
753420 756881 Don't stop, don't stop, just keep drivin'.<br />Run the red light.
756923 760427 - That's all I got.<br />- Put that fuckin' money away, asshole.
760468 762679 - Shit.<br />- Just run all the lights. Drive.
762721 764889 - You got it, boss.<br />- Damn.
764931 766766 - That cut deep?<br />- How would I know?
766808 769185 Just keep pressure on it.
769227 771730 Oh, fuck.
771771 774274 Jesus, right? John McClane. I owe you one.
774315 777318 Damn right. You know what<br />those guys are doing to my shop?
777360 781072 - Chill out.<br />- You relating to me? Talk like a white man.
781114 782574 Look, Jesus, I'm sorry...
782615 786453 - "Jesus"? I look Puerto Rican to you?<br />- Guy back there called you Jesus.
786494 790582 He didn't say "Jesus", he said, "Hey, Zeus".<br />My name is Zeus.
790623 792208 - Zeus?<br />- Yeah, Zeus.
792250 797088 As in father of Apollo? Don't fuck with me<br />or I'll shove a lightning bolt up your ass?
797130 799716 Zeus. You got a problem with that?
800342 803053 No. I don't have a problem with that.
803094 807140 - Downtown. Police Plaza.<br />- Oh, that's just great.
811186 817150 I need a record of his collars, recent releases,<br />and anybody he might've looked at sideways.
818360 819861 Textbook megalomania.
819903 825158 It's a pathological state in which fantasies<br />of control or omnipotence predominate.
825200 828953 He wants control over him -<br />his actions, thoughts, even his emotions.
828995 832624 - Sounds like a secret admirer.<br />- Maybe he'll send me flowers.
832665 834626 Everybody knows you like pansies.
834668 838129 It's not that kind of emotion. This guy is ugly.
838171 841299 - How is that?<br />- Nothin' wrong a shower wouldn't cure.
841341 844386 Beer is normally taken internally, John.
844427 848723 - Just give me some aspirins, will you?<br />- Yeah, OK. Hold this here.
848765 852435 - This is Fred Schiller, John. He's a...<br />- Shrink. Yeah, I got it.
852477 857732 Yes. We're dealing with a megalomaniacal<br />personality with paranoid schizophrenic...
857774 862112 Let's skip down to the part where you<br />tell me what the fuck this has to do with me.
862153 866366 I don't know. What I do know is<br />it does have specifically to do with you.
866408 869661 This guy wants to pound on you<br />until you crumble.
869703 875041 - He wants you to dance to his tune, then...<br />- Put on a dress and fuck me?
875083 877210 I was going to say "kill you".
878044 880088 He's sitting on an awful lot of rage.
880130 883591 And it could be manifested physically<br />if he's stressed.
883633 887721 - Somebody he arrested or pissed off...<br />- That could be one helluva long list.
887762 890932 - Fuck you, Joe.<br />- These people don't like anonymity.
890974 895812 They want you to know who's doing it to you.<br />So this name Simon is probably not an alias.
895854 898273 It's probably Simon or some variation.
898314 903778 Simon, Robert E. Extortion, kidnapping.<br />10-15. Did seven years for good behaviour.
903820 906656 - Released on work furlough two months ago.<br />- Check it.
906698 908158 Thanks, Rick.
908199 911870 He was a bankrupt businessman<br />who kidnapped his partner's daughter.
911911 914831 He's a fuck-up, not a psycho.<br />The guy we want is nuts.
914873 917792 A nut who knows a lot about bombs.
917834 923840 We found this in a playground. Professional.<br />Very cool stuff. You know... boom.
923882 927969 - Should you slam it around like that?<br />- It's unmixed. You can't hurt it.
928011 931848 - This stuff is cutting-edge. It's a binary liquid.<br />- A what?
931890 934642 Like epoxy. Two liquids.
935727 938521 Either one by itself...
939773 943234 You got nothin'. But mix 'em...
954329 955955 Ricky?
960460 963004 You're gonna be wearin'<br />that shirt up your ass!
963046 966383 - Christ almighty, Charlie.<br />- Like I said, very cool stuff.
966424 969052 Now, with a package like this<br />you get a warning.
969094 971012 The bomb has to arm itself.
971054 975558 You'll see the red liquid<br />pump into the clear before it detonates.
975600 979020 - How long before?<br />- Ten seconds, two minutes.
979062 984109 Could be anything.<br />But once it's mixed, be somewhere else.
984150 988238 This stuff has got to be rare. We ought<br />to be able to find out if any is missing.
988279 991741 I already did. Livermore Labs.<br />Theft over the weekend.
991783 996079 - He got enough to make another one, Joe?<br />- About 2,000 pounds.
996121 997414 Of that?
997455 1000959 The detonating mechanism can be anything.<br />Radio, electrical...
1001001 1003378 Hell, you could use a beeper and phone it in.
1003420 1005839 Inspector? Inspector, it's him.
1005880 1008883 This one's got a double<br />Alberti feedback loop on it...
1008925 1011553 Charlie? Charlie.
1012470 1013513 Start the trace.
1021604 1023231 Simon.
1023273 1026443 He wore the board,<br />walked the street and survived.
1026484 1029904 <i>Hauptmann </i>Walter,<br />where are my pigeons now?
1029946 1031781 Pigeons?
1031823 1035577 "I had two pigeons bright and gay<br />fly from me the other day."
1035618 1039122 "Why was it they did go?<br />You cannot tell, you do not know."
1039164 1043460 - You mean McClane?<br />- No, I mean Santa Claus.
1045545 1049841 - Yeah, I'm here.<br />- Ah, there after all. And your friend?
1049883 1053553 Carver. Carver.<br />We need you in the other room. Let's go.
1053595 1056097 - Come on.<br />- They need you. Go.
1056139 1059059 - Yeah, he's here, too.<br />- And may I speak with him?
1061061 1064773 - Is the ebony Samaritan there now?<br />- You got a problem with ebony?
1064814 1070445 No. My only problem is that I went to some<br />trouble preparing that game for McClane.
1070487 1072781 You interfered with a well-laid plan.
1072822 1077535 Yeah? Well, you can stick your well-laid plan<br />up your well-laid ass.
1079454 1083500 That was not smart.<br />There are lives at stake here.
1083541 1087253 - Not enough time, Inspector.<br />- You better hope he calls back.
1087295 1088880 He will.
1090799 1094177 Ricky, you wanna tell those people<br />to shut up out there?
1094219 1096221 Hey. Keep it down here.
1105105 1108608 Simon. He wasn't speaking for all of us.
1108650 1112028 That was unpleasant.<br />Don't let it happen again.
1112070 1115407 - So, what's your name, boy?<br />- Don't call me "boy".
1115448 1118785 I'm sorry. It was a poor attempt at humour.
1118827 1121246 I was going to send you home with a chiding.
1121287 1127043 - But now I think you should join the game.<br />- We got him. It's a payphone. In Oslo.
1127085 1128378 Norway?
1128420 1131840 - Wait. Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.<br />- Forget it.
1131881 1134884 Australia? He's scrambling up their system.
1134926 1137887 Having fun with the phone company, are we?
1137929 1140682 Simon says McClane and the Samaritan
1140724 1143810 will go to the subway station<br />at 72nd and Broadway.
1143852 1147188 I will call in 15 minutes<br />on the payphone outside the station.
1147230 1151026 No police. Failure to answer<br />will constitute noncompliance.
1151067 1153653 Do you understand me, John?
1153695 1155613 Yes, I understand.
1155655 1159242 I understand you're a fuckin' wacko<br />that likes to play kids' games.
1159284 1161244 - Hardly.<br />- Hardly?
1161286 1163830 Well, who are you? Somebody I sent up?
1163872 1167417 What did you do?<br />Shoplifting? Purse-snatching?
1167459 1169002 Cross-dressing?
1169044 1173423 You c-c-couldn't catch me<br />if I stole your ch-ch-chair with you in it.
1173465 1177302 My ch-ch-chair with me in it?<br />That's very exciting.
1177344 1181306 Let me ask you a question, bonehead.<br />Why are you trying to k-k-kill me?
1181348 1183308 John, calm yourself.
1183350 1188271 Why don't you come on down here and we'll<br />figure this out like a couple of men, huh?
1188313 1192567 - If killing you was all I wanted, you'd be dead.<br />- Simon. This is Inspector Cobb.
1192609 1198114 I can appreciate your feelings for McClane.<br />But believe me, the jerk isn't worth it.
1198156 1203203 He's stepped on so many toes here, by this<br />time next month he'll be a security guard.
1203244 1205413 His own wife wants nothing to do with him,
1205455 1208708 and he's about two steps shy<br />of becoming an alcoholic.
1208750 1211378 One step, one step.
1211419 1213588 Now, listen to me.
1213630 1217258 You sound like a real smart guy.<br />What is it that you want?
1217300 1221346 - Are you talking about money?<br />- Well, whatever.
1222347 1224933 McClane is a toilet bug.
1224974 1228645 What would it take just to forget him<br />and live happily ever after?
1228687 1230647 You know, money is shit to me.
1230689 1235110 I would not give up McClane<br />for all the gold in your Fort Knox.
1235151 1240031 72nd Street subway payphone, 15 minutes,<br />McClane and the Samaritan.
1240073 1243159 If you're competent in the least,<br />you found the briefcase,
1243201 1246413 so you know what I mean by penalty.
1248998 1253128 - Thanks for that vote of confidence, Walter.<br />- I thought it was worth a try.
1253169 1257173 - This guy's a raving maniac.<br />- He's as clear as a case history.
1257215 1260468 He gave clues to his identity.<br />He spoke German,
1260510 1264264 he said "your Fort Knox", and he stammered<br />when McClane pushed him.
1264305 1267684 - You believe this guy really can't be bought?<br />- No chance.
1267726 1271062 The very mention of money<br />only enraged him further.
1278737 1282407 - What's that?<br />- It's your shield.
1282449 1284993 - Are you asking me to be a cop again?<br />- Get his gun.
1285035 1286619 You didn't answer me.
1286661 1288913 Hey.
1288955 1291750 You didn't answer my question, Walter.
1292375 1295128 Are you done, Lieutenant?
1295170 1298548 You two better get going<br />to get up to 72nd Street on time.
1298590 1301509 - Joe, this time they go with backup.<br />- You got it.
1301551 1303887 I'm not goin' anywhere.
1303928 1308058 - Simon says you gotta go.<br />- I'm not jumpin' through hoops for a psycho.
1308099 1311144 That's a white man with white problems.<br />You deal with him.
1311186 1313813 Call me when he crosses 110th Street.
1315106 1317817 - Why'd you save my ass?<br />- I didn't.
1317859 1320362 I stopped a white cop<br />gettin' killed in Harlem.
1320403 1324366 One white cop gets killed today,<br />tomorrow we got a thousand white cops,
1324407 1327577 all of 'em with itchy trigger fingers. Got it?
1328995 1330663 Get him back.
1332916 1335710 - Charlie, where'd you find that bomb?<br />- Chinatown.
1335752 1337462 Shit.
1337504 1340340 Yo, partner. Wait up.
1340382 1344386 I ain't your partner. I ain't your neighbour,<br />your brother or your friend.
1344427 1347097 I'm your total stranger.
1347138 1349808 OK, stranger.
1349849 1354104 You know where that park is<br />at 115th Street and St Nicholas?
1355313 1359150 - Yeah, it's in Harlem.<br />- Where do you think we found that bomb?
1359192 1363446 Listen. This guy doesn't<br />care about skin colour.
1363488 1365865 Even if you do.
1366908 1370495 - What am I doin'?<br />- Cheer up. Things could be worse.
1370537 1375250 I was workin' on a fat suspension, smokin'<br />cigarettes and watchin' <i>Captain Kangaroo.</i>
1375959 1377836 Come on.
1386177 1388722 They made it to the phone,<br />but there's a problem.
1388763 1393893 - What do you mean? How big a problem?<br />- About 300 pounds.
1393935 1396896 - Excuse me, ma'am. We need this phone.<br />- Do you mind?
1396938 1399190 - Honey, I'm a cop.<br />- I'm sorry, but...
1399232 1401693 Get off the damn phone. Police business.
1401735 1404195 - Well, I never.<br />- I can get used to this.
1404237 1407157 I'm sure you can find a phone<br />across the street.
1407198 1410994 Let's get something straight.<br />I'm the only one on police business.
1411036 1414748 Let's get somethin' else straight.<br />You need me more than I need you.
1414789 1418418 You don't like the way I do things, fine. I quit.
1426801 1429512 All right, I need you.
1434642 1438188 All right, I need you more than you need me.
1441941 1442650 Hello?
1442692 1445653 Birds of a feather flock together,<br />so do pigs and swine.
1445695 1448698 Rats and mice have their chance,<br />as will I have mine.
1448740 1450700 Nice. It rhymes.
1450742 1454662 - The phone was busy. Who were you calling?<br />- The psychic hotline.
1454704 1458249 - Take this more seriously.<br />- It's a public phone. What can I say?
1458291 1464130 Simply say there was a fat woman on it<br />and it took you a minute to get her off.
1464172 1470011 Now, John, there's a significant amount of<br />explosive in the trash receptacle next to you.
1471638 1476309 - Try to run and it goes up now.<br />- Nobody's running, but I got 100 people here.
1476351 1480230 That's the point.<br />Now, do I have your attention?
1480271 1482982 As I was going to St Ives<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1483024 1487153 Every wife had seven sacks. Every sack had<br />seven cats. Every cat had seven kittens.
1487195 1491991 Kittens, cats, sacks and wives, how many<br />were going to St Ives? My phone number is...
1492033 1494994 - Wait. I didn't get that. Say it again.<br />- Not a chance.
1495036 1500750 My phone number is 555 and the answer.<br />Call me in 30 seconds or die.
1503378 1506256 - Seven guys with seven...<br />- Shut up. I'm good at this.
1506297 1508299 - Seven guys and...<br />- Shut the fuck up.
1508341 1512595 He said seven wives with seven sacks.<br />7 times 7 is 49. Tell me the rest.
1512637 1515598 - A sack with seven sacks...<br />- Weren't you listening?
1515640 1518685 - What is wrong with you?<br />- A bad fuckin' hangover.
1518727 1521521 All right. Seven wives times seven, 49.
1521563 1524524 With seven cats.<br />Seven times 49 is... 343, right?
1524566 1529988 - You askin' me or tellin' me?<br />- I'm telling you. 343 times seven is...
1530030 1533033 - 2,401. That's what you got, right?<br />- Yeah.
1533074 1537871 - Is that it? 2401?<br />- That's it, dial. 555-2401.
1539330 1542375 - No, wait. It's a trick.<br />- What do you mean?
1542417 1545128 - I forgot the man.<br />- Fuck the man. We got ten seconds.
1545170 1547339 He said, "How many were going to St Ives?"
1547380 1551134 The riddle begins, "As I was going to St Ives<br />I met a man with seven wives."
1551176 1554095 - The guy and his wives are going nowhere.<br />- What they doin'?
1554137 1556639 Sittin' in the fuckin' road. How do I know?
1556681 1560393 - Who's going to St Ives, then?<br />- The guy. Just the guy.
1560435 1562479 - Just one guy.<br />- The answer's one.
1562520 1565023 - How do you dial one?<br />- 555-0001.
1565065 1568193 - 0001. Just one guy's goin'.<br />- Hello, John.
1568234 1570779 Piece of cake. Give us something harder.
1570820 1573490 - But you're ten seconds late.<br />- The answer is one.
1573531 1576326 - Boom.<br />- There's a bomb in the trash.
1582374 1584959 Get down. There's a bomb.
1587879 1590048 Welcome to New York.
1592133 1594135 They were just talking.
1594177 1598264 Let's get out of here. Come on.<br />Come on, let's go.
1612320 1614489 Bomb.
1620161 1621079 Yeah.
1621121 1623748 I didn't say "Simon says".
1623790 1628712 It's 9:50, John.<br />The number 3 train is arriving now.
1628753 1632173 I left something provocative<br />on that train, John.
1632215 1637971 Simon says get to the payphone next to<br />the news kiosk in Wall Street station by 10:20,
1638013 1641433 or the number 3 train<br />and its passengers vaporise.
1641474 1644978 Use any means of travel other than civilian,<br />I blow the train.
1645020 1647814 Attempt to evacuate the subway,<br />I blow the train.
1647856 1652444 - I call you in 30 minutes. Be there.<br />- We're fucked.
1652819 1656614 90 blocks in 30 minutes in New York traffic?
1656656 1661036 It could be double that.<br />We don't even have a car.
1661077 1664956 Hey, sir. I'm a cop. I am requisitioning<br />this car for police business.
1664998 1667542 What you doing?<br />What you doing with my cab?
1667584 1671463 Pretty slick. I used to drive a cab.<br />The fastest way south is...
1672464 1674966 What the fuck are you doing?
1679554 1681389 What were you sayin'?
1681431 1686353 I was saying, I used to drive a cab<br />and Ninth Avenue was the fastest way south.
1686394 1688146 But we seem to be going east.
1693860 1696863 Where the hell you goin'?<br />I told you Ninth Avenue was...
1696905 1701201 - Stop yelling. I know what I'm doin'.<br />- Not even God knows what you're doin'.
1701242 1703912 They're headed east on 72nd<br />towards the park.
1703953 1707207 - Wall Street is south.<br />- Stop yellin' at me. I got a headache.
1707248 1712087 And the best way south is not Ninth Avenue.<br />It's through the park.
1712128 1713338 Oh, dear.
1714714 1718927 - I told you Park Drive was always jammed.<br />- I didn't say Park Drive.
1721388 1723682 I said through the park.
1726351 1729229 Shit. We lost 'em.<br />They're in the park, headed south.
1730438 1732691 Get outta here.
1732732 1734818 Fuckin' prick.
1739614 1742242 I got him, Connie.<br />He's takin' the scenic route.
1743076 1745704 - Outta the way.<br />- Oh, man.
1755046 1757966 Watch it, watch it.<br />Are you aiming for these people?
1758008 1759134 No.
1759175 1761177 Well, maybe that mime.
1763013 1764514 Tree! Tree! Tree!
1769728 1771479 What's goin' on here, man?
1777027 1779571 Tree! Tree!
1779612 1782198 - Hang on.<br />- Rock! Rock!
1785452 1786995 Oh, shit.
1793293 1796463 McClane, watch it.
1798465 1800717 McClane!
1808016 1809476 Outta the way.
1809517 1812729 - How do Catholics do that thing?<br />- North, south, west, east.
1812771 1815065 - How much time?<br />- 27 minutes.
1815732 1819819 72nd and Broadway<br />to Central Park South in three minutes.
1819861 1822238 That's gotta be a fuckin' record.
1822280 1824115 Ah, get out...
1825658 1828244 Yeah. Now what?
1834376 1836836 - We need a fire truck.<br />- What?
1836878 1838963 To follow.
1842092 1844594 - 911.<br />- Lieutenant John McClane, NYPD,
1844636 1847764 access number 7479,<br />calling from a civilian transmitter.
1847806 1851059 - Get me an emergency dispatcher now.<br />- Dispatch. Go ahead.
1851101 1855772 I got two officers down at 14th Street<br />and Ninth Avenue. Need an ambulance. Over.
1855814 1859317 Emergency calls go to Roosevelt Hospital,<br />two blocks from here.
1886594 1888555 Slow the fuck down, McClane.
1888596 1892350 Kinda like football, isn't it?<br />Get a blocker, head for the end zone.
1895854 1898314 Say Wall Street, he'd have gone all the way.
1898356 1903611 Wrong. South of 14th Street's<br />a different hospital. St Luke's.
1903653 1905363 Hang on.
1913455 1915665 Time?
1915707 1919127 10:02. We're halfway there,<br />with 18 minutes to go.
1919169 1921338 Fuck this. Hang on.
1934267 1935352 Hang on.
1936102 1937979 Slide over and take the wheel.
1938021 1940774 - Where you goin'?<br />- We should be ahead of that train.
1940815 1943610 I'm gonna get on it.<br />Get to that payphone by 10:20.
1943651 1947030 - What you gonna do?<br />- Get that bomb. You fail, I cover your ass.
1947072 1950950 - I fail, you cover my ass.<br />- And if we both fail?
1950992 1955538 Then we're both fucked. Go now, drive.<br />Get to that phone booth by 10:20. Go.
1955580 1958500 This is my lucky fuckin' day.
1961795 1962754 Shit.
1962796 1964798 Look out. Look out.
1966716 1968551 Look out. Look out.
1968593 1971179 Look out. Get outta the way.
1976393 1979270 This is a bad idea.
2005380 2008633 Excuse me, excuse me.<br />Get out of the way, please.
2023231 2027485 - 112 Wall Street.<br />- Wait. This isn't a taxi. You don't understand.
2027527 2033533 Your light's on. I'll make it simple. 112 Wall<br />Street or I'll have your medallion suspended.
2033575 2036870 What? You don't like white people?
2036911 2039831 112 Wall Street.
2039873 2041541 You got it.
2052802 2056139 Move your legs.<br />Get your legs outta the way. Sorry.
2098598 2099891 Shit.
2101059 2102519 Excuse me. Watch out.
2102560 2105355 Excuse me, sir. Pardon me, please.
2108149 2112779 You wanna step out here for a minute?<br />I'm a cop. Step out here for a minute, please.
2140098 2143351 Excuse me, please.<br />Can we get through here, please?
2143393 2144936 Excuse me.
2144978 2146938 Excuse me, please. Pardon me.
2146980 2150150 Excuse me, sir, I'm expecting a call.<br />I need that phone.
2150191 2153028 Why don't you use the other phone?
2156906 2160410 Sir, please. I need to use that phone.
2160452 2163455 Listen, bro. I was here first.
2163496 2165540 "Bro"?
2165582 2167375 Get away from the goddamn phone.
2167417 2170337 Get your hands up.
2186102 2190190 - I have to answer that.<br />- Just shut up and get 'em in the air.
2190231 2193777 Watch it, excuse me, pardon me.<br />Watch your backs.
2193818 2196321 Ladies and gentlemen, I'm a police officer.
2196363 2200325 I'm gonna ask you to calmly and quietly<br />move to the other end of the car.
2200367 2203661 Go now, please. Go now.
2203703 2205163 Fuck.
2205205 2209668 Don't hit this. Watch out.<br />Watch it. Watch it. Go.
2212253 2215924 I have to answer that phone.
2215965 2218259 Get 'em up.
2218301 2224933 Look. If you have to shoot me,<br />then you go ahead and you shoot me.
2224974 2229646 But I have to answer this phone. All right?
2234776 2236653 I'm here.
2236695 2240323 - And McClane?<br />- He's on his way.
2240365 2244619 - He's a little slow. He's kinda out of shape.<br />- The rules applied to both of you.
2244661 2248289 I'm afraid this is noncompliance. Goodbye.
2255714 2257799 Trust me, guys.
2259676 2261970 Duck.
2297047 2299966 Get outta there.<br />Duck, asshole.
2351434 2353520 McClane?
2365073 2369285 - You can see right into the subway.<br />- How many fire trucks do you count?
2369327 2372330 - You guys, you guys.<br />- How can you see from up here?
2374708 2378837 Officer, tell those people to<br />get the hell back, will ya?
2378878 2381464 We got cuts and bruises, a few concussions,
2381506 2385677 some guy's pacemaker stopped and<br />a pregnant girl's water broke. That's all.
2385719 2388930 - How are you doin', John?<br />- Still can't hear too good.
2388972 2392183 It's a miracle you're still alive.<br />A goddamned miracle.
2392225 2394728 - That's the problem, Joe.<br />- What?
2394769 2398732 The miracle part. What are the odds<br />of us makin' it here on time?
2399691 2400775 Zip.
2400817 2404529 That bomb was gonna go off no matter what.<br />He wanted it to go off, right here.
2404571 2407240 Take this off me, Dave.
2407282 2409617 What's so special about this place?
2409659 2413413 - I don't know. Something doesn't add up.<br />- Lieutenant McClane?
2413455 2418084 - They're asking for you and a Mr Carver.<br />- Where?
2418460 2420337 John?
2421671 2425884 John, this is Andy Cross. With the FBI.
2425925 2430221 - This is Bill Jarvis. He's...<br />- I'm with another agency.
2430263 2434934 - It's good to meet you.<br />- This is Lieutenant McClane and Mr Carver.
2436144 2439022 We got a couple of questions first.
2439064 2441649 Recognise this guy?
2445612 2447655 No.
2447697 2449991 How about this one?
2453703 2455872 How about you?
2456831 2459626 Did you recognise the voice on the phone?
2459668 2461586 No.
2461628 2464714 Have you noticed any cars following you?
2467884 2468885 No.
2468927 2472138 Anybody following you at all?<br />Any kind of surveillance?
2472180 2475475 Telephone, house, anything unusual at all?
2476518 2478353 Well...
2478395 2483942 Now that you mention it, I have experienced<br />a burning sensation between my toes.
2483983 2487529 I thought it was just some<br />athlete's foot or somethin'.
2490031 2494160 We read your jacket, Lieutenant.<br />We were told you would be cooperative.
2494202 2497330 - Cooperate with what? We're wasting time.<br />- Wait a minute.
2497372 2501084 You want to share information,<br />how about sending a little our way?
2501126 2504170 - We wanna hear what he knows first.<br />- What the hell?
2504212 2509759 - We want to hear what he knows first.<br />- Hey, I know as much as you know, all right?
2509801 2514055 There's a guy out there settin' off bombs.<br />He calls himself Simon.
2514097 2519019 He speaks with a German accent,<br />and for some reason he's very angry with me.
2519060 2522147 Now, maybe you can tell me why, fellas, huh?
2527444 2529738 First man there is Mathias Targo.
2529779 2534325 Was Hungarian army. Explosives expert.<br />Now we believe he's working for the Iranians.
2534367 2538580 - Working?<br />- Freelance terrorism. By contract.
2539789 2541791 - Who's the girl?<br />- Targo's other half.
2541833 2545587 Rumour is the Israelis slipped a bomb<br />in between their sheets.
2545628 2548381 He wasn't at home,<br />but they think maybe they got her.
2548423 2552844 The second man was an obscure colonel<br />in the East German army.
2552886 2557265 Ran an infiltration unit, the kind of thing<br />the Nazis did at the Battle of the Bulge.
2557307 2560643 - English-speaking troops...<br />- Yeah, I saw the movie.
2561603 2566900 All we know of him is the GDR medical<br />records show he suffers from migraines.
2566941 2570070 His name is Peter Krieg.
2572197 2575742 Well, that is an exceptional report, fellas.
2575784 2578411 Now you wanna tell me<br />what this has to do with me?
2578453 2582415 The name "Gruber" mean<br />anything to you, Lieutenant?
2585669 2588338 It rings a bell, yeah.
2588380 2591633 LA. That thing in the building in LA.
2594219 2600433 Peter Krieg was born Simon Peter Gruber.
2601393 2604729 He's Hans Gruber's brother.
2608858 2612862 - Shit.<br />- Yeah. It's that thing in LA.
2612904 2618868 We figure he's got you fitted up for a toe tag,<br />and he's gonna do anything to get it tied.
2619244 2622205 Inspector. Inspector, it's him.
2623540 2626167 Don't let him know we're here.
2629295 2632298 - Simon.<br />- Inspector.
2632340 2635218 Now, who from the FBI<br />is in the van, I wonder?
2635260 2638638 Let's see. Almost certainly Cross.<br />Come on, Andrew, say hello.
2638680 2640265 Hello.
2640306 2643685 And I know you never run alone,<br />so say hello, Bill.
2643727 2647480 Still trying to butch up<br />by chewing on your glasses?
2649107 2652861 This, gentlemen, as they say,<br />is where the plot thickens.
2654112 2659617 I have put 2400 pounds of explosive in<br />one of the 1446 schools in Greater New York.
2659659 2664414 It is fitted with a timer<br />set to explode at exactly 3pm.
2665415 2668001 Thank you. Your silence says I'm understood.
2668043 2672881 - Did you say 2400 pounds?<br />- Yes, but please don't interrupt again.
2672922 2677802 Simon says, if you attempt to evacuate<br />schools, the bomb will be detonated by radio.
2677844 2680138 And, gentlemen, someone will be watching.
2680180 2685060 Repeat - one school will be dismissed<br />at 3pm, permanently. Unless...
2685101 2686227 Unless what?
2686269 2690357 Unless John McClane and his new best friend<br />complete the tasks I set them.
2690398 2692484 John, are you listening?
2694110 2695570 Yeah.
2695612 2698656 The payphone beyond Hope,<br />Tompkins Square Park.
2698698 2701534 20 minutes. Go by foot. No rush.
2701576 2705872 If you're clever you'll learn the location<br />of the bomb and the code to disarm it.
2705914 2711002 Oh, and by the way, gentlemen, we got<br />something of a bargain on radio detonators.
2711044 2715632 The only problem is the darn things seem<br />to respond to police and FBI frequencies.
2715674 2719260 So, if I were you, I'd keep off your radios.
2719302 2721388 Simon, wait.
2725183 2729354 2400 pounds of that liquid stuff. My God.
2730522 2731856 Get the commissioner.
2731898 2734734 He's in a press conference.<br />He's due in half an hour.
2734776 2737987 Ricky, get every senior officer on the site<br />here right away.
2738029 2740448 You gonna try any jurisdictional nonsense?
2740490 2745245 I got two kids in the school on 64th Street.<br />What can I do to help you?
2745286 2747539 - How many men have you got?<br />- 75.
2747580 2750166 If I push the panic button, I can get 500.
2750208 2752377 - When?<br />- Two thirty, three o'clock.
2752419 2754713 Between now and then...
2754754 2759217 We're gonna have to do this<br />all by ourselves. Let's go.
2759259 2763263 The park is over two miles away,<br />so you guys better get running. No radios.
2763304 2767267 Take my telephone. You get anything,<br />you call me through the switchboard.
2767308 2769602 - Good luck.<br />- Thanks.
2769644 2771604 Find that bomb.
2771646 2773648 - Ricky, where are they?<br />- Over here.
2773690 2776526 - Senior man present is Chief Allen.<br />- Chief of what?
2776568 2778862 - Transit.<br />- OK, thanks, Ricky.
2778903 2781906 Gentlemen, we have a decision to make.<br />Chief Allen.
2781948 2784325 The man who has done this has told us
2784367 2789456 he has planted another very large bomb<br />in a school here in the New York area.
2789497 2794127 He has told us that we cannot evacuate,<br />but he has not said that we cannot search.
2794169 2797297 I recommend we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody -
2797339 2801509 police, transit, sanitation, fire,<br />even the goddamn librarians -
2801551 2805347 and we start searching schools,<br />and I mean right now.
2805388 2808266 There's a thousand buildings<br />within the city limits,
2808308 2810977 and we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it in.
2811019 2813938 I'd like to keep the media out<br />as long as possible,
2813980 2818943 because if they get in, we've got a panic.<br />Are we in agreement?
2818985 2822030 All right, come on, guys. Let's go.
2822072 2824199 Move it out. Move it out.
2824240 2828411 No radio contact.<br />There will be no radio contact.
2837045 2839172 They bought it.
2840632 2842092 You can begin.
2856773 2859901 Hook, line...
2862404 2864906 and sinker.
2869452 2872122 You heard the man. Let's go. Let's go.
2905864 2909159 Sergeant Turley. Sergeant Turley.
2909200 2913329 In the last five minutes the volume of calls<br />has tripled. What is going on?
2913371 2916332 Stop. Let me explain.
2916374 2919627 For the rest of the day,<br />we're to handle our communication.
2919669 2924007 - What do you mean, "handle"?<br />- They're shutting down the police band.
2924049 2928219 - All calls will be through this switchboard.<br />- And I'll marry Donald Trump.
2928595 2932807 Walsh, what's goin' on?<br />Why'd everybody tear out of here?
2932849 2934934 Come on, Pamela, look at your watch.
2934976 2938605 It's shift change.<br />The bean-counters worry about overtime,
2938646 2942901 so we sent everybody back to the precinct<br />to punch out. The next shift is coming.
2942942 2945278 You are so full of shit, Walsh.
2945737 2947822 Thank you.
2954412 2956498 What the hell...?
2968468 2974307 Detective. Bob Thompson,<br />City Engineers' Office.
2974349 2977060 We'd like to get an idea of the damage.
2979270 2982232 Man, you guys really got here fast.
2983191 2984984 Well...
2985026 2987112 It's Wall Street, sir.
2987153 2989364 Lot of money here.
2989406 2994786 Lot of opinion-makers the mayor<br />doesn't want to piss off, you know.
2995829 2997914 Is this it?
3000208 3002502 Holy Toledo.
3003503 3006381 Somebody had fun.
3006423 3010719 I'd appreciate it if you'd show<br />my associates the way down.
3012512 3013972 Yeah, yeah, sure.
3014014 3019269 Jimmy. You got the flashlight?<br />Murphy, come on. You too.
3019310 3021688 - Rick Walsh.<br />- John Gunther.
3021730 3023857 Come on, gentlemen, let's go.
3027360 3030739 You were probably at the World Trade.<br />You know what that mess was.
3063438 3067275 Please inform Mr Little<br />that Mr Vanderfloog is here.
3067317 3069527 Mr Vanderfloog?
3071654 3074366 There's a Mr Vanderfloog for Mr Little.
3088254 3091883 Go down 20 metres.<br />Come on.
3091925 3096054 - A lot of steam down here.<br />- Yeah, we snapped a couple of steam pipes.
3096096 3098598 The subway guys shut down the third rail.
3098640 3102560 - Some emergency lighting.<br />- Yeah. There's still some...
3103520 3105605 No shooting.
3105647 3108900 - Speak English.<br />- Otto doesn't speak English. Do you, Otto?
3108942 3113488 - Where the hell did we get this guy?<br />- He's one of Targo's thugs.
3114656 3117701 Pull all the way up. Pull all the way.
3124624 3127252 What's this LA thing?<br />You famous or somethin'?
3127293 3129504 Yeah, for about five minutes.
3129546 3132215 - Don't tell me. Rodney King, right?<br />- Fuck you.
3132257 3134634 - This guy Simon we're talkin' to?<br />- Yeah.
3134676 3139431 I threw his little brother off the 32nd floor<br />of Nakatomi Towers out in LA.
3139472 3141766 I guess he's a little pissed off about it.
3141808 3146855 So I'm in this shit cos some white cop threw<br />some white asshole's brother off a roof?
3192025 3194778 Vanderfloog? Felix Little, corporate relations.
3194819 3198281 Sorry you had to wait,<br />but there was an explosion in the subway.
3198323 3200200 It's played hell with our alarms.
3200241 3204496 - I trust there's nothing wrong?<br />- Oh, no. Good Lord, no. Safe and secure.
3204537 3207665 Now, you were concerned<br />about a currency exchange.
3207707 3210919 We are not a commercial bank<br />in the normal sense.
3210960 3216424 We're primarily governments,<br />central banks, that sort of thing.
3216466 3220095 - Apart from the depository, of course.<br />- Of course.
3220136 3222972 And you are in the flower business,<br />Mr Vanderfloog?
3253586 3254629 Come on.
3268768 3273023 Oh, no, Mr Vanderfloog,<br />that's the vault elevator.
3273064 3276443 Sorry. Our alarms are sonic and seismic,
3276484 3279863 two things which, I'm afraid,<br />do not react well to explosions.
3279904 3283450 This subway business has knocked<br />our systems into a cocked hat.
3283491 3286411 We've had to give up<br />and pull the plug on the whole thing.
3286453 3290623 - The repair people are downstairs now.<br />- Good Lord.
3290665 3293793 Heavens to Betsy, if anyone knew...
3297005 3301051 But I thought this was a currency exchange.
3301092 3304137 I think we go straight to the withdrawal.
3352227 3357399 Captain, you wanna come down here<br />and take a look at this? Something's goin' on.
3357440 3360527 - Think you'll be able to fix that?<br />- Just a minute, now.
3365156 3366408 OK. I'll be right back.
3366449 3368576 Down!
3372455 3374499 Stay back.
3375083 3377544 Stay back.
3409993 3412412 Come on, come on.
3423173 3426593 - Front desk?<br />- Call the police. I'm under attack.
3426634 3430347 Hey, just relax, mate.<br />Maybe you'll live through this.
3430388 3431639 Shit.
3454204 3456373 I think he's dead, my dear.
3458958 3461378 <i>Leutnant, </i>see to the office workers.
3461419 3463922 It's being done, <i>Herr Oberst.</i>
3466841 3468843 And the square?
3468885 3471471 Perimeter secure, <i>Herr Oberst.</i>
3505672 3508883 One hundred and forty billion dollars.
3509926 3512929 Ten times what's in Kentucky.
3512971 3514806 Fort Knox.
3514848 3517058 It's for tourists.
3530321 3532574 Yeah? McClane.
3532615 3536036 John, you're out of shape. You barely made it.
3536077 3539789 Yeah, well, we all barely make it.<br />What do you want us to do?
3539831 3542959 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3545337 3546421 What'd he say?
3546463 3549257 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3549299 3552552 Don't you have kids? That's an elephant joke.
3560602 3562771 That a bomb?
3562812 3565648 - Yeah. Just go ahead and grab it.<br />- No, you're the cop.
3565690 3568526 - Simon says you should be helpin'.<br />- I'm helpin'.
3568568 3572739 - When are you gonna start helpin'?<br />- After you get the bomb.
3589297 3591966 - Careful.<br />- What do you mean, "careful"?
3592008 3595720 - Don't open it.<br />- What? I gotta open it.
3595762 3598723 And it's gonna be all right.
3609234 3613154 Shit. Shit! I told you not to open it.
3617617 3619869 I trust you see the message.
3619911 3623289 It has a proximity circuit, so please don't run.
3623331 3626710 I got it. We're not gonna run.<br />How do we turn this thing off?
3626751 3629045 On the fountain there are two jugs.
3629087 3632757 Do you see them?<br />A five-gallon and a three-gallon.
3632799 3638221 Fill one of the jugs with exactly four gallons<br />of water and place it on the scale,
3638263 3641683 and the timer will stop. You must be precise.
3641725 3644894 One ounce more or less<br />will result in detonation.
3644936 3648064 - If you're alive in five minutes, we'll speak.<br />- Wait.
3652777 3655363 - I don't get it. Do you get it?<br />- No.
3657115 3659284 Get the jugs.
3660368 3663830 Obviously we can't fill<br />the three-gallon jug with four gallons.
3663872 3666666 - Obviously.<br />- All right, I know.
3666708 3669836 We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?
3669878 3673048 We pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug,
3673089 3676885 giving us exactly three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug, right?
3676926 3679971 Take the three-gallon jug,<br />fill it a third of the way up...
3680013 3682515 No. He said be precise. Exactly four gallons.
3682557 3688313 Every cop in 50 miles is runnin' his ass off<br />and I'm playing kids' games in the park.
3688355 3690982 You wanna focus on the problem at hand?
3707165 3710627 You said you knew. You said<br />don't say anything if you don't know.
3710669 3714255 - Gimme the jug. We're startin' over.<br />- No. We can't start over.
3714297 3716800 I'm gonna put my foot up your ass,<br />you dumb...
3716841 3719219 Say it, say it.
3719260 3721638 - You were gonna call me a nigger.<br />- I wasn't.
3721680 3725975 - What were you gonna call me?<br />- Asshole! How's that? Asshole!
3726017 3729062 You got some fuckin' problem<br />with me cos I'm white, Zeus?
3729104 3732065 Have I oppressed you?<br />Have I oppressed your people?
3732107 3735026 Your problem is<br />you don't like me cos you're a racist.
3735068 3737529 - What?<br />- You don't like me cos I'm white.
3737570 3741449 I don't like you because you're gonna<br />get me killed. How much time?
3741491 3743910 Shit. We got less than a minute.
3743952 3749165 - Throw this thing away.<br />- We can't. It'll detonate. Wait a second.
3750417 3753003 I got it. Exactly two gallons in here, right?
3753044 3755588 Leaving exactly one gallon of empty space.
3755630 3759509 Five gallons here. Pour one gallon<br />out of the five gallons into there.
3759551 3762470 We have exactly four gallons in there.
3763346 3764764 Come on.
3765598 3767976 Don't spill it.
3768018 3771062 - Good. Exactly four gallons.<br />- You did it, McClane.
3771104 3773982 - Put it on the thing. Get it down there.<br />- Oh, shit.
3781865 3784743 Congratulations. You're still alive.
3785744 3788496 - Congratulations.<br />- Yeah, we did it.
3788538 3793126 You surprise me again, John.<br />This is becoming an ugly habit.
3793168 3798798 I don't have the time right now, Simon. Listen,<br />a deal's a deal. Where's the school bomb?
3798840 3801885 On the contrary. You have lots of time.
3801926 3807390 You have two hours<br />and 47 minutes precisely.
3807432 3811102 Plenty of time to test those wits of yours.
3811144 3816649 Listen, jerk-off. I got a bad fuckin' hangover<br />and I'm a little sick of these fuckin' riddles.
3816691 3819611 - Now, where is the school bomb?<br />- Temper, John.
3819652 3822655 The road to truth has many turns.
3822697 3826201 You will find an envelope<br />under the rim of the fountain.
3826242 3830538 When you undertake the trip it suggests,<br />ask yourself this question:
3830580 3833416 what is 21 out of 42?
3836461 3839005 We're behind. We should<br />abandon the rest and go.
3839047 3842258 Relax, Targo. There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3842300 3846805 He's sending us to the home team dugout<br />at Yankee Stadium. Why?
3846846 3849349 We're the home team.<br />We find something there?
3849391 3851393 What's 21 out of 42?
3851434 3854813 21 again. Half of 42. 42 what?
3854854 3857899 - How many men on the Yankees ball club?<br />- 25.
3857941 3861069 What else is 21? Blackjack.
3861111 3864489 - It's a club.<br />- It's a wild-goose chase is what it is.
3868284 3870578 Where's the nearest A train?
3870620 3874541 Wait, wait. You know,<br />some kid might find that.
3876376 3878461 You're right.
3884009 3886428 You little sons of bitches!
3886469 3889014 Hey, you! I'll remember you.
3890849 3893351 Hey, where are you goin'?<br />What are you doin'?
3893393 3896646 - Lemme go, dickhead.<br />- Watch your mouth.
3896688 3899899 You'd go to juvenile hall<br />for a Butterfinger, is that it?
3899941 3902819 Look around, man.<br />All the cops are into somethin'.
3902861 3906114 It's Christmas. You could steal City Hall.
3912328 3914998 - Come on. Let's go. Come on.<br />- My bike.
3915040 3917250 - That's my bike.<br />- Yeah, it's Christmas.
3917292 3921004 - Hey, Yankee Stadium's that way.<br />- That's my bike, you asshole.
3927594 3930555 Why don't you just run over<br />everybody in the street?
3930597 3934601 - McClane, what are we doin' back down here?<br />- Let me ask you something.
3934642 3938396 - What is it that Wall Street doesn't have?<br />- You're talkin' in riddles.
3938438 3940815 - What does Wall Street not have?<br />- What?
3940857 3944110 Schools. And what is it<br />they have a shitload of?
3944152 3946279 What?
3953495 3957916 - I'll be back in a minute.<br />- What am I supposed to do with this?
3958541 3960543 Give it to those guys over there.
3960585 3964005 - He's here.<br />- Perhaps you could be a little more specific.
3964047 3968051 McClane <i>ist hier.<br /></i>He's walking toward the bank.
3969344 3971971 And the black man is coming toward me.
3972013 3977268 Oh, now that's a pity. And after we've<br />gone to all that trouble at the stadium.
3977310 3979771 Simon, kill him.
3979813 3983441 Stop toying with him and kill him now.
3983483 3987529 OK, so be it. May he rest in peace.
3987570 3991074 I'll inform Karl in the lobby.
3991116 3995120 - You pack up your team and get out of there.<br />- And this one?
3995161 3997247 Officer.
3999249 4001960 I'm afraid I need an answer on that issue.
4007257 4009884 - Let him go.<br />- Understood.
4009926 4013763 - Yes, sir?<br />- John McClane says to give you this.
4015265 4017892 Wait, wait. Jesus, don't open it. It's a bomb.
4017934 4019519 - Another?<br />- Yeah.
4019561 4023273 Oh, I see. We'll take care of that.<br />We'd better move now.
4023314 4028695 Sir, thank you so much for your assistance.<br />We really appreciate it. Thank you.
4048798 4051926 You are leaving this place unguarded?
4072155 4074866 - How you doin'?<br />- All right.
4074908 4077577 John McClane. NYPD.
4077619 4079704 Are you all right?
4079746 4083166 Yeah, it's laundry day.
4083208 4085502 What can I do for you, Lieutenant?
4085543 4088463 - Has it been quiet like this all morning here?<br />- Well...
4088505 4091633 Except for that big explosion<br />a couple of hours ago.
4091675 4094886 Have you seen anything strange<br />in the last hour or so?
4094928 4099307 No. And we've had cops in here pretty steady<br />since the subway thing.
4100141 4103144 We're gonna make a round of the vault.<br />Wanna tag along?
4103186 4105855 Sure. I think I will.
4105897 4110026 - What do you think of this heat?<br />- Indian summer, huh?
4110068 4113655 Yeah, feels like it's gonna rain<br />like dogs and cats later.
4113697 4118076 Here's one of your guys.<br />Detective Otto, isn't it?
4118118 4120203 John McClane.
4122706 4125291 Hey, Mike, how you doin'?
4126710 4130630 I keep tellin' myself I'm gonna take the stairs<br />just for the exercise,
4130672 4132757 on a hot day like this.
4132799 4136428 But it seems like<br />I always end up riding the lift.
4162829 4165665 What was the lottery number last night?
4165707 4169210 You guys play the lottery? No?
4169252 4173590 My wife buys me two tickets every week.<br />For ten years she plays the same numbers.
4173631 4178178 I say, "Why not play a different number?"<br />She goes, "Those are my lucky numbers."
4178219 4180680 I got the tickets right here.
4183600 4187437 Put that fuckin' gun down.<br />Put the fuckin' gun down now.
4193151 4195111 Put it down.
4200408 4202577 Hello?
4202619 4204829 Anybody down here?
4215090 4217175 Put your fuckin' hands up.
4217217 4219928 John, no, no. It's me.
4222180 4225392 - You almost gave me a heart attack.<br />- You all right?
4225433 4228019 - You all right?<br />- Yeah. It's not my blood.
4228061 4232482 - What the hell's goin' on down here?<br />- Go take a look in there.
4254087 4257799 Hey, McClane. Where the hell is everybody?
4257841 4260468 Simon fuckin' says.
4261469 4266349 I should have seen it comin'. This was never<br />about revenge. It's about a goddamn heist.
4266391 4269561 - Well, what was in the room?<br />- This.
4269602 4271479 What is this?
4271521 4274065 - Shit, is this gold?<br />- Yeah, it's gold.
4274107 4275608 Damn, this is heavy.
4275650 4281448 They cleaned out a whole room of this?<br />That would have taken, like, a tank or a...
4281489 4283783 A dump truck.
4283825 4286036 14 great big dump trucks.
4286077 4288455 - We almost got hit by a dump truck.<br />- Shit.
4288496 4290040 Damn. Slow down.
4290081 4292125 - Put that shit down.<br />- No fuckin' way.
4292167 4294419 - They won't let you keep it.<br />- We'll see.
4294461 4296338 - We're gonna need a car.<br />- A car?
4302635 4306306 - Know how to hot-wire this thing?<br />- Course I can. I'm an electrician.
4306348 4308683 Only problem is...
4311936 4313980 it takes too fuckin' long.
4326242 4330413 - Not on the bridge.<br />- Down there, McClane. The FDR.
4333375 4335418 Let's go, come on.
4336586 4339297 - Oh, shit.<br />- What?
4339339 4341883 - I shot the phone.<br />- Too bad.
4341925 4344719 - What's 21 out of 42?<br />- I don't have a clue.
4344761 4349224 - What about Yankee Stadium?<br />- Later. That guy is not gettin' off Manhattan.
4349265 4352519 Jesus Christ!<br />Who do you think you are? Hillary Clinton?
4352560 4355855 That's it! Hillary Clinton. The 42nd president.
4355897 4360902 - No, she'd be the 43rd president.<br />- All right, all right, but who's the 21st?
4360944 4362654 - I don't know.<br />- You don't know?
4362696 4364948 - Do you know?<br />- No.
4365699 4371246 - What engine does this piece of shit have?<br />- It's a Yugo. It's built for economy, not speed.
4374040 4377961 - What are you doin'?<br />- I'm gonna get us another phone.
4379504 4381840 Wait, wait.
4381881 4385510 - Who was the 21st president?<br />- Go fuck yourself.
4387429 4391307 - That guy was pissed.<br />- He'll feel better if he checks the back seat.
4391349 4393518 Shit, that was my gold bar.
4393560 4396104 This is McClane. Get me Inspector Cobb.
4396146 4399482 - John, where are you?<br />- It's not a revenge. It's a heist.
4399524 4400442 What?
4400483 4404904 Federal Reserve gold, they took a shitload.<br />They're headed north in dump trucks.
4404946 4408616 - Have you been drinking, McClane?<br />- No, not since this morning.
4408658 4411911 There's dump trucks<br />northbound on the FDR at about 70th.
4411953 4414664 Close the bridge<br />and get some helicopters over.
4414706 4419794 I couldn't close a hot dog stand. I'm spread<br />all over. What about this damn bomb?
4419836 4422756 Find out who the 21st president was.<br />It's connected.
4422797 4425592 - John? The 21st what?<br />- Walter?
4425633 4428720 Shit. Goddamn cellular fuckin' phones.
4428762 4433725 Tell Munson at Triborough to close all<br />the East River bridges north of 59th Street.
4433767 4435894 - Look for dump trucks.<br />- Dump trucks?
4435935 4440106 McClane says there are dump trucks<br />headed up the FDR loaded with gold.
4440148 4443193 Walter, they don't allow<br />dump trucks on the FDR.
4443234 4444444 Connie!
4444486 4448239 You don't want I should argue, I won't argue,<br />no matter how stupid it is.
4448281 4453286 Canine, check out the boiler room.<br />Did you find anything, Charlie?
4453328 4456623 I could spend a week here with<br />an x-ray machine and not find it.
4456664 4460001 You have five more minutes,<br />then we're movin' up to 86th Street.
4460043 4462379 We're goin' as fast as we can.
4462420 4463963 What's up?
4464005 4467717 McClane mentioned something about<br />the Federal Reserve building.
4467759 4471429 - Isn't that near that Wall Street bomb site?<br />- Yeah.
4477644 4479938 How long do you want us to stay here?
4479979 4482607 The men at the stadium. Stay or go?
4482649 4485402 Karl should have checked in by now.
4494202 4496329 Come on, come on.
4497622 4501042 Stay where you are.<br />McClane may still turn up.
4501960 4508299 Relax, Targo. If he is still alive,<br />he won't be talking to anyone.
4508341 4509926 It's the next turnoff.
4511177 4513430 Elvis Duran. You're on the air. What's up?
4513471 4518268 First of all I wanna tell you what a great show<br />you got. I listen to you all the time.
4518309 4522856 - Thanks. What d'you wanna talk about?<br />- All those cop cars screaming around.
4522897 4526443 You know what they're up to?<br />There's a bomb. In a school.
4526484 4528528 My cousin's a cop.
4528570 4531364 Somebody put a big bomb<br />in a school somewhere.
4531406 4536786 Only they don't know which one,<br />so they're searching all of 'em.
4536828 4539164 Every school in the metropolitan area.
4539205 4541499 Holy shit.
4541541 4544669 Doris! Doris, can you get ahold of my wife?
4545378 4549758 Turley! Half the goddamn city just called 911.
4552385 4553845 They're gone.
4553887 4555388 - What?<br />- They're gone.
4555430 4557390 - Who is this guy? Houdini?<br />- Shit.
4557432 4558892 Down there, down there.
4560477 4564397 - This thing got air bags?<br />- Your side does. I don't know about mi...
4565065 4567067 McClane!
4587504 4590548 In the truck. Let me see the hands.
4590590 4593093 Put 'em on the door.
4596471 4599182 Don't kill me. Don't shoot me.
4600475 4604938 - You a truck driver?<br />- No, I'm a beautician. Of course I am.
4605980 4608858 - Where are you takin' this truck?<br />- The aqueduct.
4608900 4611736 What are you takin' it to the racetrack for?
4611778 4616282 - No, the aqueduct. The water aqueduct.<br />- "Aqueduct"?
4618576 4623164 See? It goes from here all the way<br />up to the Catskill Mountains.
4623206 4625125 - What does?<br />- That. The water pipe.
4625500 4627752 Goes for about 60 miles.
4634718 4636219 - You the foreman?<br />- Yeah.
4636261 4640890 NYPD. You had any extra dump trucks<br />come through in the last couple of minutes?
4640932 4645311 I'm gonna write those clowns up.<br />They better pay attention to work orders.
4645353 4648565 - Who?<br />- The dozen idiots who tore ass up the tube.
4648606 4651735 We're not loadin' up there any more.<br />We're loadin' here.
4651776 4654195 So much for bridges and helicopters.
4654237 4658366 - Got a map to show where this tunnel goes?<br />- Yeah, right here.
4659784 4663538 We run up under the Saw Mill<br />until you get up to the cofferdam.
4663580 4666624 From there on we've already<br />brought the water down.
4666666 4671046 - Any way to get in or out of there?<br />- There's a vent shaft every two miles.
4671087 4674049 - No, I mean with a truck.<br />- At the cofferdam you can.
4674090 4678553 You can get there on the surface. Follow<br />Saw Mill River Parkway. It's about 20 miles.
4678595 4680597 I'm gonna meet you there, all right?
4680638 4684184 - What am I supposed to do?<br />- Go up to Yankee Stadium.
4684642 4687479 - McClane!<br />- Go. We got less than two hours.
4687520 4689356 Goddammit.
4695695 4697614 Somethin' wrong?
4697655 4701659 480 yards of rock moved so far.<br />Now, that's ten times the Hoover Dam.
4701701 4705830 Right now there's 516 feet<br />of rock above our heads.
4705872 4708708 This part is phase three of tunnel three.
4708750 4714714 Planning for it began back in 1954, but<br />construction didn't begin till June of 1970.
4714756 4717384 You know the most interesting<br />part of this tunnel?
4717425 4720053 - What's that, Jerry?<br />- The valves. Each one...
4726810 4730563 ..big departure from tunnels one and two.
4731314 4733024 Come on.
4733066 4737904 - What a helluva place to break down.<br />- Hold it, Jerry. Let me have your hard hat.
4737946 4740824 - You got a jacket?<br />- Yeah, here.
4740865 4742325 Wait here a minute.
4743034 4745745 Wait until he gets alongside the door.
4745787 4749207 Fellas? Mickey O'Brien, aqueduct security.
4749249 4753670 We had a report of a guy comin'<br />through here with eight reindeer.
4760093 4764931 They said he was a jolly old fat guy<br />with a snowy white beard.
4764973 4769728 Cute little red and white suit.<br />I'm surprised you didn't see him.
4771271 4774691 What is it with you guys and these phones?
4774733 4777527 Maybe this'll give me somethin'.
4777569 4780780 Holy shit. Is that guy dead?
4780822 4783408 Yes, Jerry. I'm afraid he is.
4783450 4786077 - Jesus Christ.<br />- Yeah.
4786119 4790749 I want you to get ahold of a guy named Cobb.<br />Walter Cobb, C-o-b-b.
4790790 4793626 He's the head of my police unit.<br />Get him down here.
4793668 4798298 Tell him you were with John McClane. Tell<br />him to find out who the 21st president was.
4798340 4800675 Chester A Arthur.
4800717 4802594 - What?<br />- Chester A Arthur.
4802635 4806765 1881 to 1885.<br />Nominated vice president in 1880.
4806806 4809934 Did you know he was<br />collector of customs in New York?
4809976 4812270 No, I didn't know that, Jerry.
4812312 4814439 Take care of yourself.
4878211 4882924 - TV's got us. We gotta release Traffic.<br />- No. Traffic jams we can clear later.
4882966 4885802 What is wrong with this thing?<br />What about Ricky?
4885844 4889055 I can't get ahold of him.<br />But, Walter, Federal Reserve...
4889097 4892225 - Yeah?<br />- Biggest gold storage in the world.
4894310 4897814 You get a unit back there. Find Ricky.<br />Find out what is goin' on.
4897856 4901234 Walter! You gotta hear this.
4905238 4910326 - I thought we were going in the back way.<br />- This is the back way, Walter.
4910368 4915040 In half an hour you're gonna have a riot<br />at every school in the city.
4920086 4922630 Start at the top floor.<br />Put 20 men on each floor.
4922672 4925216 Send the other 50<br />down to the basement with us.
4925258 4929346 - What about McClane?<br />- I'm gettin' nothing. Busy signal.
4929387 4931848 This is puttin' all our eggs in one basket.
4931890 4934559 - I mean, what if McClane's wrong?<br />- Walter!
4934601 4937020 This is Principal Martinez. Inspector Cobb.
4937062 4939189 - How do you do?<br />- How do you do?
4939230 4944110 I don't wanna alarm the children. Please move<br />them to the auditorium and keep them calm.
4962671 4965965 We are coming to the dam.<br />You can call the rearguard.
4971179 4973932 Rearguard, you can close up now.
4975141 4979270 We've reached the dam.<br />You can come up now.
4979312 4982148 Nils, you can close in now.
4983149 4986736 - Nils?<br />- Attention, attention. Nils is dead.
4986778 4990323 I repeat - Nils is dead, fuckhead. So is his pal.
4990365 4994703 And those four guys from the East German<br />All-Stars, your boys down at the bank?
4994744 4996746 They're gonna be a little late.
4996788 4998456 John.
4999499 5005088 In the back of the truck you're driving<br />there's 13 billion dollars in gold bullion.
5005130 5008675 - Would a deal be out of the question?<br />- Yeah, I got a deal for ya.
5008717 5013596 Crawl out from under that rock you're hiding<br />under and I'll drive this truck up your ass.
5013638 5015056 How colourful.
5021146 5023356 I told you not to toy with him.
5023398 5026109 Thank you. That's very helpful.
5028778 5031906 You have jeopardized the mission<br />and the contract.
5034159 5040290 We're vulnerable till we've reached the ship.<br />I'm going to put an end to this.
5040331 5041666 Stop!
5044753 5046838 Targo! Targo!
5046880 5049174 Here. Come here.
5050342 5052469 - We blow the dam.<br />- What?
5052510 5054012 We drown him.
5060894 5064022 Yanni, get that up there.
5066024 5067359 Walter!
5067400 5073406 Look at this. The janitor said this one was<br />delivered this morning. About 10:30, right?
5073448 5075158 - Not hooked up.<br />- Yeah?
5075200 5078036 OK, now take a look at the front.
5080497 5082665 We drill the hinges. Get everybody out.
5233650 5235735 McClane!
5237612 5239322 - McClane!<br />- Where are you?
5239364 5240865 Over here.
5240907 5244577 You got a helluva way of flaggin'<br />somebody down. You all right?
5244619 5247372 - Did you go to Yankee Stadium?<br />- Yeah. Nobody there.
5247414 5250834 You didn't see nobody?<br />Nobody was followin' you?
5250875 5253128 I'm tellin' you, he's jerkin' us around.
5253169 5255171 Oh, shit! Damn! Come on.
5255213 5257882 "No, I didn't see nobody. Nobody followed..."
5257924 5260218 Go! Go! Go!
5264305 5266891 It's not rigged. Pull it.
5278236 5282240 Well, I'd say you could call off your search.
5282282 5284993 - Can you stop it?<br />- I shouldn't even touch it.
5285035 5289164 Who knows what kind of booby traps<br />this thing's got? What about the code?
5289205 5292042 - No word.<br />- When do we evacuate?
5292083 5296046 - Simon says he sees one kid leave, boom.<br />- So maybe somebody's watchin'.
5296087 5300675 But we can't stand here with our thumb<br />up our ass waitin' for this thing to blow up.
5307265 5310477 - Shit.<br />- Keep your head down.
5310518 5312187 Hold it steady.
5317400 5320320 - Outta the way.<br />- Go around him.
5333041 5335418 - I found out who's the 21st president.<br />- Who?
5335460 5338672 - Some guy named Arthur.<br />- Chester A Arthur?
5338713 5341633 - That's it.<br />- Chester A Arthur Elementary School?
5366449 5371663 Hi, kids. I know you usually have<br />assembly on Fridays, but today's special.
5371705 5374416 Mr Lambert here is from the fire department,
5374457 5378294 and today he wants us to practise<br />a brand-new fire drill.
5378336 5383299 So I want you to divide in half. Half of you<br />go over here - teachers will help them -
5383341 5385635 and line up against the wall.
5385677 5391516 The other half will go this way.<br />Please do it very quietly and very quickly.
5391558 5394144 Everybody up, please. Teachers, help them.
5394185 5397647 Fire drill, my ass.<br />That guy ain't from the fire department.
5397689 5402777 - Maybe it's because of the radio.<br />- You mean, like, they're after us? Nah.
5402819 5405989 - Tony squealed on us.<br />- No, he didn't.
5406031 5409701 - Come on.<br />- Where you goin'?
5412412 5416541 - Let me drive.<br />- Go ahead. Goddammit.
5418460 5421338 Why didn't you say?<br />Of course he put it in that school.
5421379 5424299 - Why would he do that?<br />- To get your complete attention.
5429888 5432932 Find the fuse panel.<br />Where's the fuse panel?
5432974 5435435 - Here.<br />- Pull out the antilock brake fuse.
5435477 5439731 - Shit, I don't know which it is.<br />- Yank 'em all out, then.
5439773 5443735 Put your head down.<br />This is gonna be really bad.
5443777 5446905 Listen to me. Hang the fuck on, all right?
5473723 5476685 What the fuck happened?
5476726 5478186 You got a Triple A card?
5478228 5480772 Keep moving.
5480814 5483525 I've got the janitors making a last sweep now.
5483566 5485193 Thank you, Miss Martinez.
5502377 5504379 Come on.
5505171 5507757 Five-card stud, threes and nines are wild.
5508091 5510176 Stay down. Stay low.
5519269 5521104 Oh, man.
5524065 5526192 - What you doin'?<br />- Interrogating him.
5526234 5530113 - What's he gonna tell you? "I'm dead"?<br />- I ain't gonna know till I ask him.
5530155 5534492 Go around and see<br />if there's any aspirins in that glove box.
5534534 5536953 No way. You do it.
5542292 5547464 Ten quarters. The guy in the dump truck<br />had ten quarters. Exactly ten quarters.
5547505 5550425 Maybe they were makin'<br />long-distance phone calls.
5550467 5552469 No.
5552510 5555513 It's for the bridge.<br />It's for the toll on the bridge.
5557557 5561895 There. Down on the wharf.<br />Dump trucks. Right there.
5564731 5567817 Christ, they got it loaded on a ship already.
5568818 5569944 Shit.
5569986 5573406 - How about the Coast Guard?<br />- It'd take 'em an hour to get here.
5573448 5575658 Shit.
5575700 5578787 - We can jump.<br />- What? You're outta your fuckin' mind.
5578828 5581706 - It's 100 feet down to the deck.<br />- But not to the crane.
5581748 5585043 The cables would cut you in half.
5585085 5586836 - I can make it.<br />- Bullshit.
5586878 5589964 Get down. Look in the back of that car<br />for some gloves.
5592884 5596179 Six booby traps, four dead ends,
5596221 5599057 and a partridge in a pear tree.
5603269 5605855 OK, honey.
5605897 5607524 Let's dance.
5607565 5611319 We're gonna have a race. So when I say go,<br />I want you all to run like crazy.
5611361 5615824 Follow the police officer and the fireman.<br />You guys are my front runners.
5615865 5618201 Walter. Think we're cuttin' this thin?
5618243 5621913 No, Joe, we're gonna wait.<br />McClane still may get the code.
5624165 5627502 - Line me up with that crane.<br />- There. Right there.
5627544 5629921 - Right there. You're OK.<br />- I see it now.
5630922 5634551 - This'll take a miracle.<br />- Keep your fingers crossed. Swing it.
5636177 5637887 You almost got it. Almost...
5637929 5639806 Yeah! All right.
5639848 5643393 - Where you goin'? You in a hurry?<br />- I'm goin' first this time.
5644728 5647689 We have the intercom rigged, sir.
5647731 5652027 The kids may be fine, but you wait much<br />longer and I'm gonna pee in my pants.
5652068 5654904 We're gonna wait, Connie.
5654946 5657365 Six more minutes.
5671546 5673548 McClane. Down there.
5684017 5687187 Shit. Go, man, go.
5712921 5714964 Oh, boy.
5716007 5718468 Am I glad you talked me outta jumpin'.
5747038 5749290 Get his feet.
5788663 5793293 We find Simon, drag him to the ship-to-shore<br />radio and beat that code out of him.
5793335 5794961 Here. Take this.
5795003 5797213 - How's it work?<br />- You can't shoot a gun?
5797255 5800091 All brothers don't know<br />how to shoot guns, you racist.
5800133 5803887 Sue me. Just yank back on that<br />and pull the trigger.
5803928 5805764 - That's it.<br />- That's it?
5805805 5808099 Just don't shoot yourself.
5808141 5811311 Hey, don't be no hero.<br />You find him, you come get me.
5882924 5885844 - You have the autopilot set?<br />- Yes, sir.
5885885 5887887 Good.
5892267 5894853 Don't fuckin' move.
5901109 5903695 - The Samaritan.<br />- Gimme the goddamn code.
5903737 5906823 Code?
5906865 5910493 You mean, for the school?<br />I'm sorry, I can't do that.
5910535 5916458 You call in that code right now,<br />or I'll blow your sick ass into the next world.
5917542 5920462 If that's what you gotta do.
5932223 5934559 You got to take the safety catch off.
5935977 5939314 See, that works. Now, where's McClane?
5956664 5958667 What was that?
5962504 5964464 He said, "Don't shoot".
5964839 5968760 OK, Charlie. We're gonna<br />have to go with the evacuation.
5968802 5971638 - We're gonna go.<br />- You heard the man. Let's go.
5971680 5973431 We're gonna go.
5973473 5977394 On my mark. Five, four, three, two, one.
5977435 5979270 Go!
5981773 5985360 Let's do it.<br />OK, gang. Let's go.
5985402 5988279 Go, go, go. Hip-hop, hip-hop.<br />Come on, everybody.
5988321 5991574 Let's go. Run, run, run. We're gonna win.
5991616 5993743 Go!
5994327 5996162 Keep movin'. On your left.
6008341 6010885 What are they doin'?
6010927 6013138 Hey, where you goin'?
6014639 6018935 I see you all day, little man. Policeman.
6020395 6023064 And you don't go away.
6023106 6026359 Yeah, I'm that fuckin' Energizer Bunny.
6027861 6030363 Where are you going now?
6032657 6035744 Going to arrest me, Bunny?
6038038 6040874 I don't think I'm gonna arrest you.
6040915 6043001 I'm gonna fuckin'...
6053511 6057807 - I knew it was bullshit. Nobody's watching.<br />- Time to get Charlie out.
6057849 6059851 Let's move, Charles. Time's up.
6059893 6063521 - Give me another 30 seconds.<br />- It takes a minute 15 if you're a kid.
6063563 6066107 And you're not too light on your feet.<br />Now move.
6067275 6069861 - Up here!<br />- Oh, my God.
6072072 6076242 - Christ, get 'em out of there.<br />- The rooms are locked.
6079371 6081873 Any one marked "4".
6081915 6087128 - What's goin' on, Walter?<br />- We still have kids in the building.
6091257 6094886 - I'm stayin'.<br />- No, Charlie, get outta there.
6096137 6099015 You ever see that show called<br /><i>The Addams Family </i>?
6099057 6101893 They got a motherfucker on there<br />called Lurch.
6101935 6105605 You don't think I'm gonna let you<br />get to that gun, do you?
6108983 6110944 Fuck.
6131798 6135343 4... 4... Fuck it.<br />Get out of the way.
6146354 6149107 - Where are they, Walter?<br />- Still in.
6155530 6157949 No guts, no glory.
6160702 6163913 If we get to the roof<br />we can jump to the next building.
6163955 6166499 - Shit.<br />- Out of the way.
6167250 6169419 OK, come on.
6170754 6172922 Get 'em up here. Come on.
6172964 6176843 Mayday. Mayday.<br />Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in.
6190273 6192359 Come on, kids.
6196404 6198698 Shit, it's too far.
6205622 6207082 No guts, no glory.
6207999 6210335 It's a big black-and-white fuckin' boat.
6210377 6212837 - Please stay on the line.<br />- Yeah, sure.
6231189 6233024 Pancake syrup?
6233566 6235777 Stupid, stupid.
6235819 6238363 Asshole.
6238405 6240323 Hello, John McClane.
6241700 6244327 There was never any bomb<br />in the school, was there?
6244369 6246496 Of course not.
6246538 6248915 I'm a soldier, not a monster.
6248957 6252210 Even though I sometimes work for monsters.
6252252 6255171 No, the real bomb is on this ship.
6259592 6262053 Coast Guard.
6262095 6265598 I was telling 'em where the boat was.
6265640 6269436 - Game over, huh?<br />- Not quite over.
6270603 6273898 Bridgeport Coast Guard, come in, please.
6273940 6276735 They put you on hold?
6276776 6279446 She told me to stay on the line.
6283033 6286578 - God, I love this country.<br />- Your brother was an asshole.
6289080 6293877 - He really was an asshole.<br />- He was an asshole. You got his number.
6297505 6301301 Forgive me.<br />Would you help Mr McClane below?
6302635 6304929 Careful, now.
6306139 6309809 Now, do you have the communiqué?
6309851 6312771 - Bridgeport radio, come in, please.<br />- Coast Guard.
6312812 6314647 - Oh, you're there, dear.<br />- Yes.
6314689 6318234 - Have you the ability to record a message?<br />- Yes.
6318276 6320445 - Then please begin now.<br />- Right.
6326534 6329287 This is a communiqué from the CRF.
6329329 6333249 For too long the West has conspired<br />to steal the wealth of the world,
6333291 6336961 consigning the balance of humanity<br />to economic starvation.
6337003 6340048 Today we will level the playing field.
6340090 6343343 In a few minutes the contents<br />of the Federal Reserve Bank,
6343385 6346304 the gold your economies are built on,
6346346 6351351 will be redistributed by explosive<br />across the bottom of the Long Island Sound.
6352852 6357524 If you are not in gridlock,<br />I invite you to come and watch.
6361277 6364489 - You're gonna blow it all up?<br />- That's the idea.
6364531 6369285 There are some gentlemen in the Middle East<br />who think they'll make a great deal of money.
6369327 6374082 See the men safely off the ship<br />and I'll see you in the port-side launch.
6374124 6378294 What the hell's all this<br />got to do with killin' McClane?
6378336 6380797 Life has its little bonuses.
6380839 6383174 You said you didn't even like your brother.
6383216 6385593 There's a difference between not liking him
6385635 6389222 and not caring when some Irish flatfoot<br />drops him out of a window.
6389264 6393768 - I didn't even know that motherfucker.<br />- And I never invited you aboard this ship.
6393810 6398481 - No riddle's gonna stop this motherfucker?<br />- No code, no riddle, no fancy countdown.
6398523 6400608 Hey, fuckhead.
6400650 6402235 Yeah, you, fuckhead.
6403570 6406406 There's just one thing I gotta know.
6407115 6412120 You got any aspirins?<br />I've had a bad fuckin' headache all day long.
6415081 6418084 Must be your lucky day.
6418126 6420754 Keep the bottle.<br />Run.
6432015 6435310 Where is the gold?
6436436 6442359 He's betrayed us.<br />The containers are filled with that.
6474057 6478812 If I hadn't saved your ass I wouldn't be about<br />to blow up with $100 billion of gold.
6478853 6481356 I got bad news.<br />You're only gonna blow up with me.
6481398 6483316 - What?<br />- There's no gold.
6483358 6486236 - How d'you know?<br />- I know the man, I know the family.
6486277 6491199 The only thing better than blowin' up<br />all that gold is makin' people think he did.
6491241 6494661 - Where is it?<br />- I don't know. Back at the docks somewhere.
6494703 6499666 - Is that supposed to make me feel better?<br />- No. But you're wrong, you're not gonna die.
6499708 6505672 - You know some cop trick about handcuffs?<br />- Yeah, use a key.
6505714 6508258 - Can you pick this lock?<br />- Is this black shit?
6508299 6510927 Stop that racial shit.<br />Are you a locksmith or not?
6510969 6513471 I could do it if I had somethin' to do it with.
6513513 6517684 - Like a splinter of that cable I slid down?<br />- That might work.
6519728 6522897 - Hold on.<br />- What the fuck are you doin'?
6525900 6527902 Fuck! Shit!
6527944 6531406 - How's that? That big enough?<br />- Yeah. That might work.
6531448 6534826 All right. I'm gonna drop it in your hands.<br />Cup your hands.
6534868 6537662 - Don't drop this motherfucker.<br />- I'm gettin' right.
6537704 6542042 - You ready? Ready?<br />- One, two... Spit it.
6542083 6543209 Yeah.
6543251 6545587 - You get it?<br />- Come on, move your hands.
6548214 6552427 - Damn. I was just startin' to like you.<br />- Yeah, well, don't. I'm an asshole.
6552469 6554471 What are you talkin' about now?
6554512 6557390 - I lied to you, Zeus.<br />- About what?
6557432 6562812 You remember I said Weiss found that bomb<br />up in Harlem? They found it in Chinatown.
6562854 6565315 That's low. Even for a white fucker like you.
6565357 6567942 I told you I was an asshole.
6567984 6570278 What the fuck was that?
6570320 6572864 I don't know.
6572906 6575992 It was the only way<br />I could get you to come with me.
6576034 6578119 - You got a wife, McClane?<br />- Yeah.
6578161 6580747 I'm surprised anybody<br />stayed with you that long.
6580789 6583667 She didn't stick around.<br />We're sort of separated.
6583708 6588505 - What the fuck is "sort of separated"?<br />- Well, she was in LA, I was in New York.
6588546 6592217 We had a fight on the phone, she hung up...<br />I didn't call her back.
6592258 6594636 How long ago was that?
6594678 6597806 - About a year ago now.<br />- About a year?
6599474 6602227 What the fuck are you laughin' about?
6602268 6606106 You threw away your marriage cos<br />you were too stupid to pick up the phone?
6606147 6610402 - You think that's funny?<br />- I bet you blame that shit on your wife, too.
6610443 6612737 My wife is a very stubborn woman, yes.
6615573 6618952 - Stop fuckin' laughin' and undo these cuffs.<br />- I'm almost...
6618993 6622288 There. How's that for concentration?
6622330 6625750 - Oh, shit. Fuck. I dropped the thing.<br />- You dropped it?
6625792 6627419 Goddammit.
6627460 6629587 - Shit. Where'd it go?<br />- Just find it.
6629629 6632757 I don't fuckin' see it.
6633717 6636469 What the fuck is that?
6636511 6639097 I think I made it mad.
6639681 6642100 - Get outta here.<br />- Gotta do somethin'.
6642142 6645729 Goddammit, McClane, listen to me.
6645770 6648273 Just go.
6648314 6652902 I've had a hard enough day without your<br />death on my conscience. Shut up and think.
6652944 6657365 - Tools. Check the engine room.<br />- There's no time.
6657407 6661161 - What the hell's it doin' now?<br />- It's mixing. Shit!
6662579 6666499 - What the hell are you doin'?<br />- Get ready. Lean forward, goddammit.
6669294 6672505 - It's gonna go fast. Lean forward.<br />- Oh, no.
6672547 6674883 Get ready. Move your hands.
6675508 6677969 - Fuckin' shit.<br />- Come on, let's go.
6678011 6679763 Goddamn.
6679804 6682599 - Come on.<br />- Oh, fuck, my leg.

6735443 6737612 He's gonna be just fine.
6737654 6741574 - How 'bout you?<br />- I'm all right. Did you get Ricky outta there?
6743410 6745495 Yeah, they found him.
6746746 6749582 - Are you gonna be all right?<br />- I got a bad headache.
6749624 6752836 - Think they're mad at me?<br />- Don't worry about them.
6752877 6756506 They'll get to you, but they're busy<br />with this salvage operation.
6756548 6759884 No. Dredges. Dredges.
6759926 6762095 There's no gold out there.
6762137 6765724 - What do you mean?<br />- He took it with him. He beat me.
6765765 6768560 - He beat all of us.<br />- He wasn't playing against you.
6768601 6773148 Fuck that, McClane.<br />You're still alive, aren't you?
6773690 6776484 - Well, aren't you?<br />- Yeah.

6880964 6884175 to the g-g-gullibility
6884217 6886469 of the New York Police Department.

6938146 6939647 No rush.
6939689 6942609 And, Jurgen, you'll be the padre.
6969135 6971346 Lights! Douse those lights.
6993827 6996663 Hey, dickhead.
6996705 6999207 Did I come at a bad time?
7004087 7006589 I think she's pissed at you, McClane.
7027318 7029779 He's under us right now.<br />Come on back around.
7029821 7033533 - What's out your side?<br />- Look like roaches with the lights comin' on.
7036119 7039914 - Are we going to Nova Scotia?<br />- You go with the trucks.
7039956 7043084 I have something personal to finish.

7081331 7084292 You got a gun on board? What is this?
7087545 7090882 I can't see a goddamn thing. Hold it still.
7094761 7095887 Oh, shit.
7095929 7098848 - Oh, shit.<br />- What do you mean, "Oh, shit"?
7101017 7104896 - All right, hang on. We're goin' down.<br />- See those high-tension wires?
7104938 7107482 Hey, McClane. What the fuck...?
7109442 7112987 Hey, we got smoke. We got fuckin' smoke<br />and shit flyin' on me here.
7115740 7117784 - Truck!<br />- Hold on. Here we go.
7124124 7127961 We gotta get out of here.<br />They're gonna start shootin' at us any second.
7128003 7129421 Get him out.
7129462 7134259 - The belt's stuck. I can't get it off.<br />- Look out. Here he comes.
7135385 7138430 - I can't get out, McClane.<br />- Get him outta here.
7138471 7141683 - Where you goin'?<br />- To try and get his attention.
7160618 7162328 Shit.
7162370 7165373 This keeps gettin' better and better.
7169836 7173423 I had no idea Canada could be this much fun.
7178511 7182098 Just give me somethin' to shoot at.<br />Come on, one shot.
7182140 7184726 Show me that smilin' face.
7205830 7207832 Say hello to your brother.
7209793 7211544 Get out of here.
7227769 7230939 Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
7233942 7237278 - Looks like you got his attention.<br />- Yeah, looks like it.
7239781 7244285 - Think we should call a fire truck?<br />- Fuck him. Let him cook.
7245745 7247997 - Oh, shit.<br />- What?
7249040 7250500 What?
7250542 7254087 - I left Holly hangin' on hold.<br />- Call her back.
7255130 7259884 - I don't know. She's gonna be pissed.<br />- She'll get over it.
7260468 7262721 I don't know, Zeus.
7263513 7267976 Like I said, she's a very stubborn woman.
7268018 7271521 Yeah, she'd have to be<br />to stay married to you.
