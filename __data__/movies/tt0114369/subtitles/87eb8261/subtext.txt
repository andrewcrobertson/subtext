57843 61780 They were heard screaming at each<br />other for 2 hours. Nothing new.
61780 65010 Then they heard the gun go off.<br />Both barrels.
66286 67878 A crime of passion.
68688 69780 Yeah.
70290 73054 Just look at all the passion<br />on that wall.
73054 75787 This is a done deal.<br />All but the paperwork.
80132 81724 Did the kid see it?
81724 82858 What?
83468 84492 The kid?
85370 87305 What kind of question's that?
88206 92804 We'll be real glad when we get rid of<br />you, Somerset. Always these questions.
92804 96575 "Did the kid see it?"<br />Who gives a fuck?
96575 98584 He's dead.<br />His wife killed him.
98584 101313 Anything else has nothing<br />to do with us.
110629 111617 Detective Somerset?
113233 114822 I'm Detective Mills.
117069 120697 Just get in town 20 minutes ago,<br />they dump me here.
120697 121739 Look...
122340 123673 Mills?
123673 128610 - Let's find a bar. Sit and talk...<br />- I'd like to get to the precinct.
128610 131342 Not much time for<br />this transition thing.
132852 135685 I had a question,<br />when we spoke on the phone.
135685 136616 Yeah.
138258 139418 Why here?
140193 141782 I don't follow.
141782 144625 Well, all this effort<br />to get transferred.
145764 148256 It's the first question<br />that popped into my head.
149366 153703 Same reason as you. Or the reason<br />you had before you decided to quit.
156376 157806 You just met me.
158943 161311 Maybe I don't understand the question.
162615 164139 It's very simple.
164883 168544 You actually fought<br />to get reassigned here.
169389 172984 - I never saw it done that way.<br />- Thought I'd do some good.
172984 177496 It'd be great if we didn't start out<br />kicking each other in the balls.
179399 181560 - You're calling the shots.<br />- Yes.
183068 186502 I want you to look and<br />I want you to listen. Okay?
186502 190735 I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.<br />I've worked homicide 5 years.
190735 192502 - Not here.<br />- I understand.
192502 197014 Well, over the next 7 days, Detective,<br />do me the favor of remembering that.
273425 274675 SE7EN
377329 377362 MONDAY
377362 378082 MONDAY
422307 423240 Yeah.
423810 424798 Okay.
426045 427137 Say it again?
430048 434247 I thought we moved here<br />to get away from tractor pulls.
439324 440985 Serpico's got to go.
441560 444495 Well, you might want<br />to get rid of this little...
444495 447158 crusty, this eye, Serpico.
447158 448995 - Did you get it?<br />- Got it.
448995 450160 Good.
466786 467946 Coffee?
472524 475790 Nothing's been touched.<br />It's all like I found it.
475790 477625 What time was death established?
477625 479129 Like I said...
479129 480790 I didn't touch anything...
481365 484961 but he's had his face<br />in spaghetti for 45 minutes.
484961 487802 Wait. No one bothers<br />with vital signs?
487802 492742 Did I suffer? This guy ain't breathing<br />unless he's breathing spaghetti sauce.
492742 496076 - That's how it's done here?<br />- Excuse me, Detective.
496076 500983 He's sitting in his own piss and shit.<br />If he wasn't dead he would've stood up
501386 503411 - Alright.<br />- Thank you, Officer.
504156 505418 Thank you.
515234 516292 I wonder.
518903 522932 What was the point of the conversation<br />you were about to get into?
523341 527836 Don't know. How many times Barney Five<br />found dead bodies that weren't dead.
530081 531173 Drop it.
561447 565042 Somebody phone Guinness.<br />I think we've got a record here.
581734 583725 Better Homes and Gardens.
590543 592533 Spaghetti Sauce
594745 596302 Who said this was murder?
596816 598009 No one.
599985 601749 Guy's heart must be the size...
601749 603186 of a canned ham.
606259 608418 If this isn't a coronary...
608418 609586 well...
610326 611692 I don't know.
628846 630110 Whoops.
637288 639120 How about that.
649201 651192 We had this case once...
652138 654129 guy dead on the ground...
654129 656038 knife in his back.<br />Murder...
656038 657403 right?
659479 660571 Fuck!
661214 664807 Anyway, big insurance policy involved,<br />yeah? So the guy...
664807 666374 took the tip of the blade...
666374 668850 stuck it in his own shoulder blades.
668850 671947 He must've screwed up<br />'cause there was...
671947 673855 - multiples back there.<br />- Please be quiet.
684100 685365 Wait a minute.
685365 686461 What?
689206 690798 Got a bucket here.
691908 693003 What's in it?
698884 700043 Oh God!
700043 701711 Fucking vomit.
704056 705350 Any blood in it?
705892 708326 I didn't see any.<br />Help yourself.
713599 715567 Are you thinking it's poison?
716802 719326 Oh, wonderful. Very moody.
719326 721066 Think it's poison, Somerset?
721066 724234 You girls have got forensics<br />waiting outside.
724576 725839 We might not fit.
725839 728403 There's room. Light's the problem.
728403 729778 How are you?
730950 733076 Det. Mills, go help the officers...
733076 734676 question the neighbors.
737423 738581 What?
738581 740384 And send in forensics.
756105 757437 He's dead.
758945 760378 Thank you, Doctor.
766519 768951 You saw my files,<br />the things I've done?
770288 771278 Nope.
774024 777552 I did door-to-doors and walked<br />the beat. I did that shit...
777552 778721 a long time.
779966 781625 - And?<br />- My badge says...
781625 784600 "detective".<br />That's the same as yours.
785870 787964 Look, I made a decision.
788639 791403 I had to consider<br />the integrity of the scene...
791403 795072 not whether you were getting<br />enough time on the field.
795072 796239 Hey, man...
798048 801644 Just don't jerk me off. That's all<br />I ask. Don't jerk me off.
808057 809423 He's been dead...
809423 812157 a long time, and not from poison.
812157 813663 Oh, man.
813663 815826 How can you let yourself go like that?
816402 819269 It took 4 orderlies just<br />to get him on the table.
822240 827177 - How'd the fat fuck fit out his door?<br />- Please. Obviously he was a shut-in.
827177 830340 Look. See how big this stomach is?
830340 833283 And the strange thing is,<br />it stretches.
833283 836514 Look at the size of the<br />cardiac orifice, where the food...
836514 839350 I see that, but it means<br />nothing to me.
839350 841950 Okay, he's got lines of distention...
841950 843620 across the duodenum.
843620 845322 The interior wall's ripped open.
846932 849456 This man ate till he burst?
849456 854471 He didn't really burst. Not all the<br />way. He was hemorrhaging internally.
854471 857373 There was a hematoma<br />in the rectus and...
857373 860639 - the transverse abdominous muscles.<br />- He did die by eating?
860639 861873 Yes and no.
864115 865947 What about these bruises here?
867720 869711 I haven't figured that out yet.
869711 871721 Gun pressed against his head?
871721 873224 Pressed hard enough.
873224 874485 Fuck, yeah.
874894 877488 On the front, flush with the muzzle.
879629 883067 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have ourselves a homicide.
885903 890500 Killer put a bucket beneath him,<br />kept on serving. Took his time too.
890500 893509 Coroner said it could have lasted<br />more than 12 hours.
893509 896912 Victim's throat was swollen,<br />probably from the effort...
896912 899849 and there was a point<br />when he passed out.
899849 902080 That's when the killer kicked him...
902080 904086 - and he burst.<br />- Sadistic fucker.
904590 907423 When you want somebody dead,<br />you drive by and shoot.
907423 910360 You don't risk the time<br />it takes to do this...
910360 913364 - unless the act itself has meaning.<br />- Come on.
913831 918235 Somebody had a problem with a fat boy<br />and tortured him. Simple as that.
918235 919566 In the grocery bags...
919566 923163 we found 2 receipts. So,<br />the killer stopped and went back...
923163 924764 to the supermarket.
925509 926671 So?
928177 931547 Man, it's his thing.<br />I've been out in the rain all day.
931547 933605 - This is beginning.<br />- We've got...
933605 935551 one dead guy, not three.
935551 936778 No motive.
937788 940384 Don't start that big brain of yours...
940384 942051 cooking on this, alright?
942528 944461 I'd like to be reassigned.
945697 946788 Whoa.
946788 949129 What are you talking about?
949129 951134 This can't be my last duty.
951634 952865 It'll go on and on.
953370 955966 You're retiring in 6 days.
955966 959067 You've left unfinished<br />business before.
959067 963138 Those cases were taken as close<br />to conclusion as possible.
963980 966417 - And if I may speak freely?<br />- We're friends here.
966417 968248 It's his first assignment.
968248 972312 I knew it. This is not<br />my first assignment, you dick.
972312 973585 It's too soon.
973585 976990 I'm here. You can say that<br />shit to my face. Captain?
976990 978254 It's too soon for you.
979331 980320 Captain...
980320 982490 Can we talk in private?
982490 984000 This is a personal thing--
984403 985836 Just shut up, Mills.
985836 987769 I don't have anyone else...
987769 991173 to put on this and you know it.<br />This is Metro...
991173 994144 - you don't just get to swap.<br />- Give it to me.
995513 998778 He wants out, fuck him.<br />See you, have a nice time.
998778 1000113 Give it to me.
1000113 1002153 I'll put you on something else.
1004755 1006985 Go on, Mills, just go on.
1013029 1016297 I'm sorry, old buddy,<br />but it looks like you're stuck...
1016297 1018129 cleaning up the fat man.
1025477 1025576 TUESDAY
1025576 1026416 TUESDAY
1030682 1033444 MURDER HAS A NEW UPTOWN ADDRESS!
1033444 1035347 ATTORNEY FOUND MURDERED
1036422 1037943 Quiet down.
1038923 1041288 Alright, calm down. Calm down.
1041861 1043351 Quiet down.
1047029 1048462 Here's how it'll work:
1049034 1052626 I'll answer questions for 10 minutes<br />and 10 minutes only.
1053202 1058038 Ask those questions in a calm, sane,<br />orderly fashion or I will leave.
1058038 1059972 Detective? Detective?
1059972 1061979 - Can I have a moment?<br />- No.
1067219 1071883 I won't discuss the details of this<br />investigation, so don't bother asking.
1091076 1092737 What you got for me?
1092737 1094335 Nothing yet, boss.
1097650 1100813 Why don't you guys go get<br />a coffee, huh?
1102318 1106519 We have this breaking story.<br />Let's go downtown where attorney...
1106519 1109183 Eli Gould was found murdered today.
1109183 1113698 District Attorney Martin Talbot<br />is taking questions from reporters.
1117934 1120201 That's ridiculous and offensive.
1120201 1125105 There is no conflict, and any claim<br />there could be is irresponsible.
1126442 1127707 Now hold on.
1129278 1133115 I just met with law enforcement<br />officials and they...
1133115 1137414 assured me that they have their<br />very best men on this.
1137855 1140450 This will be the very definition...
1141794 1143227 of swift justice.
1145528 1147462 GREED
1166986 1168576 Pardon me, George.
1173057 1174082 Somerset.
1174082 1175317 Come in.
1176662 1178095 You heard the news?
1178095 1179596 Nope, haven't heard.
1179596 1182498 Eli Gould was found<br />murdered this morning.
1182498 1186001 Someone broke into his law firm<br />and bled him to death.
1186903 1189097 Wrote the word "greed"<br />on the floor.
1194913 1197711 - Greed?<br />- Yeah, in blood.
1197711 1200146 Mills is heading the investigation.
1201250 1202720 Excuse me. Excuse me.
1203989 1205182 Don't do that, please?
1208424 1210258 Good for him.
1210258 1211759 What will you do...
1211759 1213923 with yourself out there, Somerset?
1213923 1217261 Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.<br />Fix my house.
1217261 1218769 Don't you feel it?
1219269 1221034 Don't you feel that feeling?
1221837 1224432 You're not going to be a cop anymore.
1224432 1226270 That's the whole idea.
1228010 1229443 I don't think you'll leave.
1230315 1232374 Hell, you can't leave all this.
1234787 1236778 Guy's out walking his dog.
1236778 1238376 Gets attacked.
1238788 1241384 His watch is taken, his wallet.
1241384 1242788 And while he's lying...
1242788 1244451 on the sidewalk helpless...
1245194 1247961 his attacker stabs him in both eyes.
1249535 1252333 This happened last night<br />about 4 blocks from here.
1253202 1254260 I read about it.
1255207 1257105 I don't understand anymore.
1257540 1259374 It's the way it's always been.
1259374 1263313 - Maybe you're right.<br />- This work is what you're made for.
1263313 1265472 I don't think you can deny that.
1266615 1268142 Maybe I'm wrong.
1270453 1272720 The coroner sent this down for you.
1273392 1275826 Found them in<br />the fat boy's stomach...
1276228 1279663 mixed in with the food.<br />Looks like little pieces of...
1279663 1281491 - plastic.<br />- Set them on that desk.
1285804 1287326 They were...
1287326 1288634 fed to him.
1388173 1389162 Lord.
1389162 1391001 GLUTTONY
1397516 1401951 This was found behind the refrigerator<br />in the obesity murder scene.
1403255 1404950 "Long is the way
1404950 1408288 And hard, that out of hell<br />leads up to light."
1408288 1409622 It's from Milton.
1410326 1411796 "Paradise Lost."
1412364 1413353 Alright...
1413353 1414625 I'm confused.
1414625 1417134 It means that this is beginning.
1417134 1418461 GLUTTONY
1418461 1420630 This was behind<br />the same refrigerator...
1421038 1423028 written in grease.
1423028 1425201 There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.
1425777 1427038 Gluttony...
1429712 1430701 greed...
1433115 1435313 sloth, wrath...
1435313 1437511 pride, lust...
1438123 1439317 and envy.
1439825 1440883 Seven.
1440883 1441891 Hold on.
1442461 1444790 This is not even my desk.
1445694 1447961 You can expect five more of these.
1449567 1450796 Wait a minute.
1452134 1454230 I can't get involved in this.
1456441 1457669 Somerset.
1458277 1459505 He wanted it.
1461144 1462337 Damn!
1462337 1463903 I'm all over it.
1498414 1499384 Where to?
1502621 1504555 Far away from here.
1516601 1519125 - Just a few things to look up.<br />- Okay.
1519125 1520896 Sit where you'd like.
1521707 1523001 How's everybody?
1524039 1525566 Hiya, Smiley.

1766651 1769211 WEDNESDAY
1792942 1794536 Fucking Dante.
1795113 1799173 Goddamn poetry-writing fagot<br />piece of shit.
1799718 1800776 Fucker.
1811961 1813451 Good work, Officer.
1820471 1822232 Thank you, Lord.
1830212 1831739 Oh, oh, sorry.
1833317 1835146 I'll move in a second.
1847663 1850259 - You want your chair?<br />- You go ahead.
1850259 1851163 Yeah?
1890038 1890836 Phone.
1892009 1894478 Package deal.<br />Comes with the office.
1899615 1900641 Mills.
1901451 1902545 Honey...
1902545 1904482 You okay? Something wrong?
1905123 1909355 You dingleberry, I told you<br />not to call me here when I'm working.
1910559 1911992 Yeah. Why?
1914632 1916065 Why?
1920805 1922067 Okay.
1925977 1927171 It's my wife.
1927576 1928702 Sorry?
1929980 1931642 She'd like to speak to you.
1941759 1943588 This is Detective Somerset.
1945596 1948361 Well, yes, it's nice<br />to talk to you too.
1950000 1952365 I appreciate the offer, but...
1954939 1957201 Well, in that case I'd be delighted.
1958173 1960107 Yes, thank you very much.
1961346 1962438 Bye.
1965182 1966442 Honey, what...?
1974459 1975892 Well?
1975892 1977257 Sorry?
1978630 1982961 I'm invited to late supper<br />at your apartment. I accepted.
1982961 1984865 At my... How's that?
1985537 1986469 Tonight.
1993545 1995479 Hello, men.
1995479 1996807 - Hi, loser.<br />- Hi, idiot.
1999682 2001048 That's Tracy. Tracy...
2002818 2003913 Hello.
2004386 2006788 Glad to meet you.<br />I've heard a lot about you.
2008057 2010048 Except your first name.
2011326 2012660 It's William.
2013395 2015662 Well, it's a good name...
2015662 2016757 William.
2017500 2019663 William, I'd like you to meet David.
2019663 2023672 - David, this is William.<br />- Alright, I'll be right back.
2023672 2026938 - How are the kids?<br />- Good. They're in the room. Come in.
2028746 2030509 Aw, good dogs.
2030509 2033516 How are all the good dogs?<br />How are you, pretty?
2044528 2046121 Smells good.
2048166 2050463 Yeah, I mean, thank you.
2051202 2053465 Please have a seat, if you like.
2053465 2057530 - Would you like a drink?<br />- No. Thanks. I'll wait.
2058275 2061472 Throw that anywhere.<br />Excuse all this mess.
2061472 2063206 We're still unpacking.
2065782 2068376 I hear you were<br />high school sweethearts.
2070788 2072380 Pretty hokey, huh?
2073625 2075056 You know something?
2075626 2078152 On our first date I knew he was...
2078152 2079719 - the guy I'd marry.<br />- Really?
2081231 2083563 He was the funniest guy I ever met.
2088306 2089465 Really.
2092577 2095010 It's kind of rare nowadays.
2095010 2097342 I mean, that level of...
2097342 2098507 commitment.
2103320 2104753 Oh, don't worry.
2105322 2107585 I won't wear it to the dinner table.
2109260 2110521 No matter...
2110521 2113257 how often I see guns,<br />I just can't...
2113257 2114764 get used to them.
2115833 2117061 Same here.
2127378 2130039 - Why aren't you married, William?<br />- Tracy.
2130039 2131376 What the hell?
2131376 2133143 I was close once.
2134217 2135480 It just didn't happen.
2135480 2137487 It surprises me.
2138121 2139646 It really does.
2141059 2142083 Well...
2143561 2147724 Anyone who spends a significant amount<br />of time with me finds me disagreeable.
2148632 2150065 Just ask your husband.
2150065 2151226 Very true.
2151568 2153400 Very, very true.
2154137 2156231 How long have you lived here?
2157074 2158166 Too long.
2162146 2163476 How do you like it?
2165416 2166576 You know...
2167085 2169416 takes time. Settle in...
2170655 2172143 it'll be good.
2172143 2174349 Well, you get numb after awhile
2175827 2177760 There are things to any city...
2183501 2184695 Subway.
2185103 2187195 It'll go away in a minute.
2190942 2192603 This real estate guy.
2193277 2195871 Fucking piece of...<br />Sorry, honey.
2196780 2200045 He shows us the place a few times,<br />I think he's good.
2200045 2202780 He's efficient.<br />Tracy really likes him.
2203186 2207556 Then I start wondering why he'll only<br />bring us here 5 minutes at a time.
2207556 2209525 We found out the first night.
2209960 2212293 The soothing, relaxing...
2212797 2214628 vibrating home, huh?
2223141 2224472 I'm sorry.
2231648 2233583 Yeah, alright, laugh it up.
2236320 2238719 I don't know why you're laughing.
2242559 2244255 Alright, already.
2248331 2250492 He had to get into the building...
2250492 2254594 before the office closed.<br />Gould would have been working late?
2254594 2257902 I'm certain. He was the biggest<br />defense lawyer in town.
2257902 2261342 - Infamous, really.<br />- Body was found on Tuesday morning.
2261342 2265849 The office was closed on Monday.<br />So he could have gotten in on Friday.
2265849 2268976 Laid low till the cleaning crew left,<br />then had...
2268976 2272510 his way with Gould Saturday, Sunday,<br />maybe Monday.
2273023 2273853 Look.
2274925 2276722 Gould was bound, right arm free.
2276722 2278954 He was handed a butcher's knife.
2280931 2282831 Check out the scale.
2282831 2284161 A pound of flesh.
2290942 2292375 "One pound of flesh"
2292375 2294934 "No more no less<br />No cartilage...
2294934 2296206 No bone....
2296206 2298646 only flesh". "Merchant of Venice."
2298646 2300047 Didn't see it.
2300047 2303177 "This task done...<br />And he would Go Free".
2303753 2305380 I tell you that chair was...
2305380 2308152 - soaked through with sweat.<br />- Of course.
2308793 2311556 The killer wanted Gould<br />to take his time...
2312063 2314054 deciding which cut....
2314054 2315326 to make first.
2315931 2317331 Imagine it.
2317331 2319231 There's a gun in your face.
2319902 2322202 Which part of your body<br />is expendable?
2322840 2324568 The love handle.
2325076 2327670 Cut along the side<br />of his own stomach.
2328146 2332378 Let's take a fresh look at these.<br />The corpse is there, but...
2332378 2335907 Look through it.<br />Edit out your initial shock.
2335907 2341014 The trick is to find one item,<br />one detail and focus on it...
2341014 2343525 until it's an exhausted possibility.
2343525 2345561 I'll get another beer. Beer?
2345561 2347427 Wine, please.
2356340 2357704 He's preaching.
2358342 2359603 Punishing.
2361612 2364603 The sins were used<br />in medieval sermons.
2365449 2367576 7 cardinal virtues,<br />7 deadly sins...
2367576 2370916 - used as teaching tools.<br />- Yeah. Like in...
2370916 2374684 - "The Parson's Tale," and Dante.<br />- You read them?
2374684 2375885 Yeah.
2375885 2378427 Parts. Remember in "Purgatory"...
2378427 2382989 Dante and his buddy climb up the hill<br />and check out all the sinners?
2384168 2387831 - The Seven Terraces of Purgation.<br />- Yeah, right.
2387831 2391271 But there pride comes first,<br />not gluttony.
2391271 2392831 For now let's consider...
2392831 2395902 the books as the killer's inspiration.
2395902 2398949 The sermons were about atonement<br />for sin.
2398949 2401449 These murders are like<br />forced attrition.
2401449 2403009 Forced what?
2403009 2406284 Attrition's when you regret your sins,<br />but not because...
2406284 2410259 - you love God.<br />- Because there's a gun in your face.
2414097 2415291 No fingerprints.
2415291 2416797 Nope.
2416797 2419960 - Totally unrelated victims.<br />- Yep.
2419960 2422800 And no witnesses of any kind.
2422800 2424534 Which I don't get...
2424534 2427543 because the fucker<br />had to get back out.
2428445 2432710 In any major city, minding<br />your own business is a science.
2433483 2437010 In rape prevention, the first thing<br />they teach you is never cry for help.
2437822 2439483 Always yell, "Fire!".
2439483 2440989 Nobody answers help.
2440989 2443083 Holler "fire," they'll come.
2443083 2444889 That's fucked up.
2444889 2447726 He must have left<br />another puzzle piece.
2449800 2454065 You know what? Thank you for talking<br />this out, but I must sleep.
2454472 2455733 Walk the dogs.
2455733 2458331 This is just to satisfy my curiosity.
2458331 2462402 - I'm leaving at the end of the week.<br />- Shit. No, wait.
2463981 2467007 Gould's wife. She was out of town<br />at the time.
2467007 2470416 - So this means she saw something.<br />- What if it's a threat?
2470416 2474514 I put her in a safe house.<br />She wasn't too happy about it.
2482400 2485027 What if it isn't what she has seen...
2485027 2489333 but what she's supposed to see<br />but hasn't had the chance?
2489333 2491204 Yeah, okay. What?
2491204 2492764 I don't know.
2494612 2496545 But that's the one thing.
2541992 2543322 I'll sign us in.
2543827 2545318 Must see Mrs. Gould.
2552068 2553434 Mrs. Gould?
2559577 2562137 Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.<br />I truly am.
2562847 2564643 I don't understand.
2565081 2567710 I need you to look at each photo...
2568219 2569846 very carefully.
2569846 2573514 Look and see if there's anything<br />strange or...
2573514 2576184 out of place, anything at all.
2577094 2578458 I don't see anything.
2579429 2582023 Please, I can't do this right now.
2582023 2583190 Okay.
2584367 2585858 It's got to be now.
2585858 2587869 There may be something we missed.
2597447 2598641 Wait.
2598641 2599681 What?
2599681 2600806 Here.
2604288 2607382 This painting, it's upside down.
2615132 2617224 - Your men didn't move this?<br />- No.
2617224 2619666 Those shots were taken<br />before forensics.
2623139 2624231 Nothing.
2625476 2627501 There's got to be something.
2638422 2641083 - He moved the screws to rehang it.<br />- Yep.
2645429 2647021 What the fuck is that?
2648498 2649931 Switchblade.
2658108 2659871 Goddamn it.
2663179 2665614 There must be something.
2670788 2672880 He didn't paint the fucking thing.
2680797 2683766 No, he's fucking with us,<br />that's what he's doing.
2684969 2687199 See this, this is us.
2688972 2690634 Just wait a minute.
2693443 2696742 - Somerset's climbing on the furniture.<br />- Wait a minute.
2702318 2704184 You're kidding me.
2704184 2706246 Call the print lab.
2711494 2712826 Oh, man.
2716333 2717766 Honestly...
2717766 2720429 have you ever seen anything like this?
2724641 2726199 HELP ME
2726199 2729210 The swell pattern tells me<br />that they're not...
2729210 2731543 the victim's fingerprints.
2741891 2743791 I don't know, man.
2743791 2745987 I say he's whacked enough.
2747731 2748925 It doesn't fit.
2749733 2751393 He doesn't want to stop.
2751393 2752559 Who knows.
2752559 2756800 Freaks out there doing their<br />evil deeds they don't want to do.
2756800 2759398 "The voices made me do it".
2759398 2761409 "Jodie Foster made me do it".
2761409 2762945 It can take...
2762945 2767108 3 days to make a match,<br />so maybe you guys want to cross...
2767108 2768913 your fingers somewhere else.
2772489 2775422 You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,<br />didn't you?
2775422 2777255 About catching this guy.
2780764 2783358 Wish I still thought<br />the way you did.
2784835 2788202 Tell me what the hell it is<br />you think we're doing?
2789106 2790971 Picking up the pieces.
2792476 2797378 We're collecting all the evidence,<br />taking all the pictures and samples...
2797378 2799541 writing everything down...
2799541 2801949 noting the time things happened.
2803286 2804378 That's all?
2804989 2806547 That's all.
2806547 2810389 Putting everything into neat piles<br />and filing it away...
2810960 2814452 on the off chance it'll be needed<br />in the courtroom.
2817134 2820398 Picking up diamonds<br />on a deserted island...
2820398 2823634 saving them in case we get rescued.
2826710 2827733 Bullshit.
2830481 2834280 Even the most promising clues<br />usually only lead to others.
2835686 2839085 So many corpses roll away unrevenged.
2842059 2845652 Don't try to tell me you didn't<br />get that rush tonight.
2846829 2848262 I saw you.
2849166 2851157 We're getting somewhere.
2861311 2861344 THURSDAY
2861344 2862304 THURSDAY
2866684 2868344 Wake up, Glimmer Twins.
2868686 2870277 We got a winner.
2876492 2880259 He uses the name Victor.<br />His real name is Theodore Allen.
2880259 2882958 Homicide found his prints<br />at the scene.
2882958 2886695 He's got a long history<br />of serious mental illnesses.
2886695 2889431 He got a very strict<br />Southern Baptist upbringing.
2889940 2892965 Somewhere along the line<br />they fell short.
2892965 2896534 Victor dabbled in drugs, armed robbery<br />and assault, spent time...
2896534 2899809 in prison for the attempted rape<br />of a minor.
2899809 2903717 His lawyer made sure that didn't<br />last long. By the way...
2903717 2906550 the lawyer was Eli Gould,<br />the "greed" victim.
2906956 2909322 We'll stop this today,<br />ladies and germs.
2909322 2913887 Victor's been out of circulation for<br />awhile, but we've a residence for him.
2913887 2916489 - You're not buying this?<br />- Doesn't seem...
2916489 2918159 Like our guy, does it?
2918159 2919293 You tell me.
2920471 2922632 Our killer seems to have<br />more purpose.
2951501 2952992 You ever take a bullet?
2952992 2956197 Never in my thirty-four years,<br />knock on wood.
2958007 2959599 I've only taken my gun out...
2959599 2962201 3 times wanting to use it.
2962201 2963940 Never pulled the trigger.
2963940 2965208 Not once.
2965748 2966579 You?
2967117 2970951 Yeah. No, I never took a bullet,<br />but...
2970951 2973614 I pulled my gun once.<br />Shot it once.
2973614 2975782 - Really?<br />- It was my first one of these.
2975782 2978054 We were a secondary unit.
2978054 2980960 I was pretty shaky going in.<br />I was a rookie.
2981364 2986132 We bust open the door looking for this<br />junkie, the fucker opened fire on us.
2987371 2989304 One cop got hit in the arm.
2991375 2993070 Christ, what was his name?
2994677 2999137 It spun him like a top... no, Well,<br />more, you know, more like slow motion.
3000550 3002143 I remember...
3003820 3005413 riding in that ambulance...
3005413 3006820 and, well...
3006820 3008322 he died right there.
3008724 3009918 Right there.
3010827 3013056 Christ, what was his fucking name?
3090974 3093498 SWAT goes before dicks.
3097246 3098737 They love this.
3099650 3100708 Police!
3105922 3106911 Clear!
3131614 3133047 Good morning, sweetheart.
3134351 3137114 Get up now, motherfucker. Now!
3146362 3148126 Get up, you sack of shit.
3155038 3156197 Oh, fuck me.
3156806 3157739 Dicks!
3158442 3160568 You'll want to come<br />take a look at this.
3163947 3165072 Dicks!
3172389 3173650 Jesus.
3173650 3174918 Victor?
3174918 3177425 - What the hell?<br />- It's just Victor.
3177425 3179155 - Call an ambulance.<br />- What the fuck?
3179155 3180594 Hearse, I'd say.
3180594 3182152 Call for forensics.
3182152 3183824 Get your people out.
3183824 3185663 No one touches anything.
3185663 3188068 It's like a frigging wax sculpture.
3192074 3193335 Sloth.
3203085 3204280 Aw, man.
3204280 3205614 Goddamn.
3206088 3208454 Those pictures were dated 3 days ago.
3216766 3218291 This must be the first.
3218291 3219231 Look.
3220036 3222527 It's dated exactly one year ago today.
3224440 3226306 I got a hair sample. I got a...
3226306 3228639 stool sample. I got piss. I got...
3228639 3230043 fingernails.
3232382 3233780 He's laughing at us.
3233780 3236148 You got what you deserved.
3240056 3241489 He's alive! Cocksucker's alive!
3242559 3243889 Guns down!
3243889 3246224 Guns down!<br />Emergency on that ambulance!
3263380 3265974 - He's playing games.<br />- Aw, no shit.
3268418 3270851 We must forget our emotion.
3270851 3275914 - We must focus on the details<br />- I feed off my emotions. How's that?
3275914 3277425 Are you listening to me?
3277425 3278983 Yes, I can hear you.
3278983 3280757 - Excuse me.<br />- What are you doing?
3280757 3283594 - Closed crime scene. Leave.<br />- I got a right to be here.
3283594 3285032 I'm a U.P.I. photographer.
3286036 3288061 I got a fucking right to be here.
3288061 3289969 - Get out! Jesus.<br />- Fucking jerk.
3289969 3291974 I got your picture, man.
3291974 3294306 - I got your picture.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
3294306 3297244 Detective Mills.<br />M-I-L-L-S. Fuck off.
3297244 3299077 - You can spell!<br />- Fuck you!
3299916 3302315 How they get here so fucking quick?
3302315 3305980 They pay police for the information.<br />And they pay well.
3306655 3308646 Hey man, I'm sorry.
3310726 3312159 They piss me off.
3312159 3313489 It's okay.
3313489 3316190 It's impressive to see a man<br />feeding off his emotions.
3323106 3328373 1 year of immobility's right, judging<br />by the muscle and spine deterioration.
3328373 3332108 Blood tests show a smorgasbord<br />of drugs in his system.
3332108 3337050 Even an antibiotic, probably to keep<br />the bedsores from infecting.
3337686 3341782 Now, has he tried to speak<br />or communicate in any way?
3341782 3344724 Even if his brain were not mush,<br />which it is...
3344724 3347284 he chewed off his tongue long ago.
3349797 3350731 Doc.
3351967 3354960 Is there absolutely no chance<br />that he might survive?
3355804 3360469 He'd die of shock right now if you<br />shone a flashlight in his eyes.
3361311 3366146 He's had as much pain and suffering as<br />anyone I've encountered, give or take
3367217 3369811 and he still has hell<br />to look forward to.
3370219 3371481 Good night.
3384501 3386161 Hello, William.
3386161 3387827 It's Tracy.
3388405 3389463 Tracy?
3390106 3391164 Everything okay?
3391574 3394442 Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.
3394442 3395637 Where's David?
3395637 3399010 He's in the other room.<br />He's in the shower.
3399010 3402108 I'm sorry to call you like this.
3402108 3403675 Oh, it's all right.
3404688 3406155 What can I do for you?
3411760 3413786 I need someone to talk...
3413786 3416797 to. Do you think you could meet me...
3416797 3419164 somewhere, maybe tomorrow morning?
3420103 3421695 I don't understand.
3422938 3425806 I feel stupid calling, but...
3427110 3430204 you're the only person<br />that I know here.
3430614 3432172 There's no one else.
3432547 3434141 If you can...
3434141 3436708 just give me a call, okay?
3436708 3438481 I have to go now.
3439289 3440380 Good night.
3440380 3441481 Good night.
3446262 3446295 FRIDAY
3446295 3447015 FRIDAY
3451001 3452092 I mean...
3453003 3454766 you know this city so well.
3455672 3457105 You've been here...
3457105 3458697 so long.
3460476 3462034 It can be a hard place.
3462646 3465170 I don't know why I asked you to come.
3466815 3468909 Why don't you talk to him about it?
3469318 3471014 Tell him how you feel.
3472322 3475188 I can't. You know,<br />I can't be a burden.
3475188 3477021 Especially now.
3478994 3481088 I'll get used to things...
3481088 3482358 you know?
3482358 3484592 I wanted to talk to someone...
3484592 3487364 who's lived here for a long time.
3488070 3492905 I mean, upstate, it's<br />a completely different environment.
3496646 3501344 Did David tell you that I teach<br />fifth grade? Well, I did.
3503119 3504882 Yeah, he mentioned it.
3508123 3511114 I've been going around,<br />looking at schools...
3513362 3515456 but the conditions here are...
3515864 3517297 horrible.
3519135 3520795 What about private schools?
3523206 3524230 I don't know.
3526208 3528699 Tell me what's really bothering you.
3531481 3533914 David and I are going to have a baby.
3538987 3540148 Oh, Tracy. I...
3541824 3543257 I don't think I'm the one...
3543927 3545257 to talk to...
3545257 3548092 - about this.<br />- I hate this city.
3552402 3554427 I had a relationship once...
3555070 3557335 it was very much like a marriage.
3560242 3561835 We got pregnant.
3563079 3565239 This was a long time ago.
3571018 3574012 I remember getting up one morning<br />and going to work.
3576092 3580527 Just a day like any other, except<br />it was the first day after I knew...
3581197 3582128 about the pregnancy.
3584099 3586465 And I felt this fear...
3587036 3588867 the first time ever.
3591373 3592806 I remember thinking...
3593576 3596875 how can I bring a child<br />into a world like this?
3596875 3599880 How can a person grow up<br />with all this around them?
3607556 3609889 I told her I didn't want to have it.
3612061 3614027 And over the next few weeks...
3615231 3616891 I wore her down.
3619735 3621670 I want to have children.
3626309 3628333 I can tell you now that...
3629244 3631577 I know... I mean...
3633483 3635416 I'm positive that...
3635416 3638181 I made the right decision.
3638181 3641416 But not a day passes<br />that I don't wish...
3641416 3644186 that I had made a different choice.
3647831 3649264 If you don't...
3649264 3650422 keep...
3651768 3654931 the baby, I mean,<br />if that's your decision...
3657005 3659599 don't ever tell him you were pregnant.
3661177 3664271 but if you choose to have the baby...
3664947 3666438 then spoil that kid...
3666438 3668277 every chance you get.
3675190 3676248 That's...
3676248 3677452 about...
3677452 3679893 all the advice I can give you, Tracy.
3687036 3687967 I must go.
3688972 3690233 William.
3697313 3698643 Thank you.

3713320 3716681 Victor's landlord said there was cash<br />in the mail box...
3716681 3718419 the first of every month.
3723175 3724201 Quote:
3724680 3727587 "I never heard a single complaint<br />from the tenant...
3727587 3731296 in apartment 306, and nobody<br />ever complained about him.
3731296 3733468 The best tenant I've ever had."
3733468 3735915 - End quote.<br />- A landlord's dream.
3735915 3737958 A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.
3737958 3739692 Who pays the rent on time.
3740569 3742504 I'm sick of this waiting.
3742504 3743737 This is the job.
3745083 3746679 Why aren't we out there?
3746679 3750358 Why must we sit here rotting,<br />waiting till the lunatic...
3750358 3751871 does it again?-
3751871 3755041 "Lunatic" is dismissive.<br />Don't make that mistake.
3755041 3757820 Come on, he's insane. Look.
3757820 3762067 Right now he's probably dancing around<br />in his grandma's panties.
3762067 3764513 Yeah, rubbing himself<br />in peanut butter.
3765452 3766513 How's that?
3766513 3767923 I don't think so.
3769166 3771365 His luck'll run out.
3772342 3774372 He's not depending on luck.
3777459 3781736 We walked in there exactly 1 year<br />after he tied Victor to the bed.
3781736 3783576 One year to the day.
3783576 3785915 - He wanted us to.<br />- Don't know that for sure.
3785915 3787425 Oh, yes, we do.
3788564 3790262 This note he left...
3790670 3792610 his first words to us.
3792610 3795295 "Long is the way, and Hard,<br />that out of hell...
3795295 3796701 Leads up to Light."
3798840 3800433 Fuck him. So what?
3800433 3801873 He's right, so far.
3802444 3806938 Imagine the will it takes to keep<br />a man bound for a full year.
3806938 3809449 To sever his hand and to use it...
3809449 3811042 to plant fingerprints.
3811042 3814020 To insert tubes into his genitals.
3814020 3817058 This guy's methodical, exacting...
3817058 3819389 and worst of all, patient.
3819389 3821395 He's a nut bag.
3821395 3825398 Because the fucker's got<br />a library card doesn't make him Yoda.
3829871 3831065 You got money?
3831540 3833473 I got 50. Fifty bucks.
3833473 3835975 I propose a field trip. Come on.
3839813 3842647 We'll make a list.<br />At the top we'll put "Purgatory"...
3842647 3846654 "Canterbury Tales," anything relating<br />to the 7 deadly sins.
3846654 3848154 - Ask yourself.<br />- Wait.
3848154 3851248 What would he study<br />to do the things he's done?
3851248 3852987 What are his interests now?
3853895 3855590 Jack the Ripper, for instance.
3855996 3857657 - Where are we going?<br />- Library.
3871845 3874781 Coupons. Coupons.<br />Free coupons. Discount--
3874781 3876339 Discount coupons.
3877252 3881951 They must have had about 50 health<br />violations during the last inspection.
3881951 3885118 Sit across from me?<br />I don't want people thinking...
3885118 3886319 we're dating.
3886962 3888451 Give me your money.
3889764 3894225 I'll give you this, but<br />I ought to know what are we doing.
3899107 3900802 Somerset. How you doing?
3901275 3903801 Didn't expect a menage-a-trois.
3903801 3906311 It's not a problem. Sit down.
3911619 3914815 Only for you do I do this,<br />so it's a big risk.
3914815 3918119 - So we're in this fair and square.<br />- It's a deal.
3923565 3924828 About an hour.
3927136 3928830 Yep. Help yourself.
3931406 3933168 That was money well spent.
3934476 3935499 Yeah.
3943485 3944850 Alright.
3944850 3948685 Telling you this, I'm trusting you<br />more than I trust most people.
3948685 3951089 Good, 'cause I might punch you.
3952828 3956763 It's probably nothing, but even so,<br />it's no skin off our teeth.
3959801 3962828 The guy in the pizza parlor<br />is a friend from the Bureau.
3964672 3965935 Who, stinky man?
3966674 3971543 For years, the FBI's been hooked into<br />the library system, keeping records.
3971543 3975447 - Assessing fines?<br />- No, monitoring reading habits.
3975447 3976882 Look.
3976882 3978886 Certain books are flagged.
3978886 3981284 Books on, say, nuclear weapons...
3981688 3983383 "Mein Kampf".
3983859 3988726 Anyone who checks out a flagged book<br />has his library records fed to the FBI.
3988726 3991060 Wait. How is this legal?
3991060 3993929 Legal. illegal.<br />These terms don't apply.
3995404 3999397 You can't use the information<br />directly. It's just a useful guide.
3999808 4004470 It might sound silly, but you can't<br />get a library card without an ID...
4004470 4006741 and a current phone bill. See?
4008484 4010451 - So they run our list.<br />- Precisely.
4011219 4013484 If you want to know who's reading...
4013484 4017081 "Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"<br />and "Helter Skelter"...
4017081 4019648 the FBI's computers will tell us.
4019648 4021252 It could give us a name.
4021252 4024424 Of a college kid writing<br />a term paper...
4024424 4026090 on 20th-century crime.
4026734 4029100 At least you're out of the office.
4029100 4030603 Get a haircut.
4031505 4032938 How do you know this?
4032938 4033837 I don't.
4034508 4036773 - Neither do you.<br />- Exactly.
4044851 4047185 "Divine Comedy".
4047185 4051453 "History of Catholicism" A book<br />called "Murderers and Madmen".
4051453 4055018 "Modern Homicide Investigation".<br />"In Cold Blood".
4055598 4057690 "Of Human Bondage". Bondage?
4057690 4059698 It's not what you think.
4060201 4062191 The Marquis de Sade.
4062703 4064466 - Marquis de Sade.<br />- Whatever.
4064466 4067132 Works of St. Thomas Aqua something...
4067132 4069301 Saint Thomas Aquinas. There.
4069301 4071743 He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
4072413 4073811 Is that it?
4073811 4074712 Yep.
4075716 4078082 - Let's try it.<br />- Jonathan Doe?
4078685 4079913 Whatever.
4079913 4082717 We're sure about that name, are we?
4082717 4085156 You were, you saw it. John Doe.
4085627 4087652 You want to go back, I'll go back.
4088128 4090494 Let's take a look at him.<br />Talk to him.
4091199 4092826 This is crazy.
4092826 4094994 We'll just talk to him.
4095802 4098829 "Excuse me, sir. Do you<br />happen to be a serial killer?"
4102409 4103842 You do the talking.
4104945 4107507 Put that silver tongue of yours<br />to work.
4107507 4109244 You've talked to my wife?
4113253 4114516 Retarded.
4114922 4116914 Charlie's fucking Angels.
4117592 4119422 A name off a computer.
4123431 4124523 Mills.
4135444 4137206 - You hit?<br />- No.
4140347 4142282 He's going down!
4158865 4160391 Fifth floor!
4180556 4182989 Police. Is there a back way out?
4183592 4184820 Lock your door.
4187663 4189927 Get out of the fucking hall, please.
4215655 4216782 Get down!
4218994 4220391 Get the fuck down.
4317426 4318619 Goddamn it.
4381056 4383353 Get out of the fucking way. Clear.
4483859 4485222 Where are you going?
4485222 4487726 - I'm going in.<br />- No, no. Wait. Wait.
4489130 4491292 What? He fucking shot at us.
4491292 4492797 You can't go in.
4492797 4495735 - We need a warrant.<br />- We got probable cause. Come on.
4495735 4498637 Think about it. Think<br />how did we get here?
4498637 4502234 - I can't tell anyone about the Bureau.<br />- Get out of the way.
4502234 4506074 We have no reason to be here.<br />Would you listen to me?
4506074 4509914 - Get off, get the fuck off me.<br />- Alright, I'm sorry.
4509914 4511976 Just pay attention a minute?
4512552 4515920 With a hole like this,<br />we won't be able to prosecute.
4515920 4518824 The fucking guy'll walk.<br />That's what you want?
4518824 4521918 By the time we clear a warrant...<br />Fuck that.
4521918 4525592 We need a reason to knock on<br />this door.
4526735 4528168 Think about it.
4529737 4530829 Okay?
4533673 4534766 Okay, okay.
4535775 4538266 You're right. I'm all fucked up.
4538266 4540109 When you're right, you're right.
4548190 4549052 Well...
4549958 4551949 no point in arguing anymore.
4553360 4555157 Unless you can fix that..
4557699 4559632 You stupid son of a ...
4567941 4570034 How much money we got left?
4570911 4572503 So, yeah, I noticed...
4572503 4573945 this guy going out a lot...
4573945 4577677 when the murders were happening,<br />so I...
4578820 4581186 So you called Det. Somerset?
4581186 4583315 - She called Somerset.<br />- 'Cause this guy...
4583315 4586324 was creepy and shit,<br />and one of the murders...
4586324 4588987 - happened right over there.<br />- I told you the rest.
4589731 4591322 Got everything?
4591322 4593389 Have her sign. You must sign.
4594467 4595458 Good.
4596637 4597900 You did good.
4598239 4600672 - I did what you said.<br />- Here.
4600672 4602731 You get something to eat.
4606481 4608244 Everybody stay outside.
4669976 4671070 Victor.
4682556 4685253 Wild Bill's Leather
4783590 4784851 Fuck.
4794467 4795467 LUST
4804346 4805404 Somerset!
4814688 4816882 - What?<br />- We had him.
4817623 4819284 What are you saying?
4819284 4821386 The fucking photographer in...
4821386 4822554 the fucking stairs.
4827467 4829458 We had him and we let him go.
4836311 4838074 You're sure this is him?
4838074 4840637 Yep. Good. Get it out.
4841315 4845753 No pay stubs. No appointment books.<br />No addresses. Just this receipt.
4845753 4847913 - Keep looking!<br />- Wait, look at this.
4847913 4850922 This was under the bed.<br />His only source of funds?
4850922 4853585 We got his money. I like it.
4853585 4856094 Wait. You won't believe this.
4856094 4858962 We haven't found a fingerprint.<br />Not one.
4858962 4861900 Right. I don't believe you.<br />Keep looking.
4866672 4868266 We could use some more men.
4868266 4869503 I'm doing my best.
4870344 4873677 - What're you getting?<br />- There are 2,000 notebooks here...
4873677 4877012 and each notebook<br />contains about 250 pages.
4877012 4878847 What about the killings?
4880088 4884456 "What sick ridiculous puppets we are,<br />what a gross stage we dance on.
4884456 4886652 What fun, dancing and fucking.
4886652 4890356 Not a care in the world.<br />Not knowing that we're nothing.
4890356 4892797 We are not what was intended."
4892797 4894801 Wait, there's a lot more.
4896103 4899766 "On the subway today, a man came up<br />to start a conversation.
4900440 4904310 He made small talk, a lonely man<br />talking about the weather and things.
4904310 4906539 I tried to be pleasant and accomodating......
4906539 4909547 but my head began to hurt<br />from his banality.
4909547 4911777 I almost didn't notice it had happened...
4911777 4914217 but I suddenly threw up all over him.
4914789 4916722 He was not pleased...
4917123 4919150 and I couldn't stop laughing".
4920561 4922052 No dates.
4922052 4925222 Placed on the shelves<br />in no discernible order.
4926301 4928292 Just his mind poured out on paper.
4929637 4931331 Looks like a life's work.
4931331 4934842 With 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,<br />it'd still...
4934842 4937467 - take 2 months.<br />- I know.
4945253 4947583 Phone? Phone? Phone? Phone?
4951159 4952749 People, quiet!
4969008 4970441 I admire you.
4971612 4974878 I don't know how you found me,<br />but I was surprised!
4975949 4979440 I respect you law enforcement<br />officers more every day.
4979440 4982114 Well, I appreciate that, John.
4982456 4984219 - I tell you--<br />- No, listen:
4984219 4988556 I'll be re-adjusting my schedule<br />in light of today's setback.
4988556 4993623 I just had to call and express my<br />admiration. Sorry I had to hurt...
4993623 4996636 one of you, but I had<br />no choice, right?
4997137 5001905 You'll accept my apology? I'd like to<br />say more but that'd ruin the surprise.
5009048 5010141 Got it.
5014887 5016481 Everybody back to work.
5018824 5020088 You were right.
5020895 5022054 He's preaching.
5024498 5026898 These murders are his sermons to us.
5026898 5029833 Look, we know him. We know him.<br />We know him.
5033007 5034440 Who's the blonde?
5039047 5040342 Looks like a pro.
5040713 5041681 Maybe.
5042181 5044115 She caught John Doe's eye.
5046420 5049014 Wild Bills' Leather
5049757 5053351 - He came and collected it last night.<br />- Last night?
5053351 5055123 - Yeah.<br />- This man?
5055123 5058186 John Doe, easy name to remember.<br />He had a limp.
5058186 5062168 - What was this job you did for him?<br />- I've got a picture.
5062168 5064329 One sweet piece, actually.
5064329 5067133 I thought he was a performance artist.
5067133 5069199 You know the sort of guy that...
5069199 5072110 pisses in a cup on stage and then...
5072110 5073612 drinks it.
5073612 5074739 Performance art.
5075083 5076275 Right.
5079253 5081552 I think I undercharged him.
5081552 5083816 - You made this for him?<br />- I've made...
5083816 5085789 weirder shit than that.
5091530 5093021 They found the blonde.
5096271 5097704 The picture!
5097704 5099170 The picture!
5100539 5102270 Fucking pigs.
5104212 5107146 - I need you to move.<br />- I'll come out, but you guys...
5107146 5109547 Get the fuck out of the booth.
5109547 5111811 I've been in this cage the whole time.
5113119 5114552 Come on, this way.
5121561 5125657 -Can you do something about the music?<br />-We're looking for the guy.
5138744 5141909 You from homicide?<br />You better see this.
5151891 5153918 Get this thing off me.
5153918 5156020 Oh God, get it off of me.
5158266 5159699 Get him out of here, now!
5161235 5162896 I want to hear it again.
5163235 5164566 Tell me again.
5166972 5170204 You heard nothing strange,<br />saw nothing strange.
5174047 5176516 He asked me if I was married.
5176516 5179074 - I saw a gun in his hand.<br />- Where was the girl?
5179074 5181417 The what? What?
5181417 5184083 The prostitute. Where was she?
5184083 5186648 Someone comes to your establishment...
5186648 5190664 they want to go downstairs,<br />get some oo-la-la. Whatever.
5191164 5193324 They got to come to you. Yeah?
5193999 5194989 Yeah.
5194989 5196400 You didn't see anyone?
5197237 5200672 With a package? A knapsack?<br />Something under their arm?
5200672 5205177 Everybody that comes in there's got<br />to be a package under their arms.
5205177 5208771 Some guys are carrying suitcases<br />full of stuff.
5208771 5210840 She was just sitting on the bed.
5217859 5220453 Who tied her down? You or him?
5220453 5222962 Do you like what you do for a living?
5222962 5225021 All these things you see?
5225021 5228795 No, I don't.
5230271 5232364 But that's life, isn't it?
5236710 5238802 He had a gun. And...
5239414 5241472 he made it happen.
5244118 5246311 He made me do it.
5246619 5249054 He put that thing on me.
5249856 5252552 And he made me wear it.
5252552 5254320 Then he...
5254320 5256226 told me to fuck her.
5258065 5260362 And I did. I fucked her.
5261066 5262728 Oh, God! Oh, God!
5262728 5265168 Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.
5265905 5268569 The fucking gun was in my throat.
5268976 5270237 Fuck.
5273079 5275239 Oh, God. God.
5275239 5278181 God, help me.<br />Please, please, help me.
5296771 5298534 This won't have a happy ending.
5299672 5302266 - It's not possible.<br />- We catch him, I'll be happy enough.
5305346 5308780 If we catch John Doe and he turns out<br />to be the devil...
5308780 5310840 if he's Satan himself...
5310840 5313215 that might meet our expectations.
5313855 5315344 But he's not the devil.
5316789 5318451 He's just a man.
5319025 5320118 You know...
5320860 5324628 You bitch and you complain<br />and you tell me these things.
5325465 5328628 If you think you're preparing me<br />for hard time...
5328628 5329726 thanks, but...
5330302 5332566 But you got to be a hero.
5333539 5335302 You want to be a champion.
5335302 5338469 People don't want a champion.<br />They want cheeseburgers...
5338469 5341811 - play lotto and watch TV.<br />- How did you get like this?
5341811 5343315 I want to know.
5347989 5350685 It wasn't one thing,<br />I'll tell you that.
5351993 5353619 Go on.
5356496 5359829 I don't think I can continue to live<br />in a place...
5359829 5363667 that embraces and nurtures apathy<br />as if it was a virtue.
5363667 5365728 You aren't different or better.
5365728 5368502 I didn't say I was. I'm not.
5368502 5371840 Hell, I sympathize.<br />I sympathize completely.
5371840 5373847 Apathy is a solution.
5374382 5380286 I mean, it's easier to lose yourself<br />in drugs than it is to cope with life.
5380286 5384289 It's easier to steal what you want<br />than to earn it. It's easier...
5384289 5388954 to beat a child than to raise it.<br />Love costs. It takes effort, work.
5388954 5394127 We talk about mentally ill people.<br />We are talking about fucking crazies.
5394127 5395793 - No, we're not.<br />- Yes, today.
5395793 5399360 No, we're talking about<br />everyday life here.
5399360 5402704 You can't afford to be this naive.
5402704 5404539 Fuck off.
5404539 5406136 See, you...
5406136 5408146 You should listen to yourself.
5408146 5410306 Yeah. You say that...
5410306 5412873 the problem is people don't care.
5413721 5415813 So, I don't care about people.
5415813 5417721 Nonsense. You know why?
5417721 5419225 You care?
5419225 5421157 Want to know-- Damn right.
5421157 5422820 You'll make a difference.
5422820 5425387 Whatever. The point is that...
5425387 5428400 you're not quitting<br />because you believe...
5428400 5430402 these things you say.
5430402 5432164 You want to believe them...
5432164 5433672 because you're quitting.
5435409 5440346 And you want me to agree with you and<br />say "You're right, it's all fucked up.
5440346 5444578 It's a fucking mess. We should all go<br />live in a fucking log cabin."
5445485 5446918 But I won't.
5447686 5449588 I won't say that.
5450725 5453191 I don't agree with you. I do not.
5457097 5457927 I can't.
5468342 5469864 I'm going home.
5478018 5479213 Thank you, though.
5509815 5511646 I love you.
5512217 5513743 So much.
5521896 5523157 I know.
5583389 5583422 SUNDAY
5583422 5584142 SUNDAY
5585726 5587920 What's your emergency?
5589061 5590587 Could you repeat that?
5591831 5593493 I've done it again.
5600507 5601757 PRIDE
5603677 5605110 What have we got?
5605110 5607168 Sleeping pills.
5608347 5610110 Glued to one hand.
5610110 5611672 Telephone glued to the other.
5613387 5614648 You see what he did?
5615588 5617146 He sliced her up.
5617525 5619458 Then he bandaged her.
5619458 5621789 Call for help and you'll live.
5621789 5623691 But you'll be disfigured.
5625664 5628190 Or put yourself out<br />of your own misery.
5629203 5630463 Come on.
5630463 5631971 He cut off her nose.
5631971 5633802 To spite her face.
5633802 5635967 And he did it very recently.
5643449 5644542 Listen...
5645552 5648543 I've decided to stay on<br />till this is done.
5648543 5652489 One of two things'll happen.<br />Either we'll get John Doe...
5652489 5655654 or he'll kill 7 and this case<br />will never end.
5655654 5659061 Don't do me any favors. Thank you,<br />but I got it.
5659061 5664002 I'm asking to be your partner a few<br />more days. You'd be doing me a favor.
5674981 5677177 You knew I'd say yes. We're here.
5678150 5681347 Your wife called.<br />Get an answering machine.
5684157 5685351 Detective?
5686994 5688688 After this I'm gone.
5689494 5692226 - No big surprise.<br />- Detective!
5695101 5696592 You're looking for me.
5699405 5700498 Don't fucking move.
5700498 5701905 On the floor.
5701905 5704101 - Stay back.<br />- On the fucking floor.
5704101 5705371 I know you.
5705371 5706775 Now. Get down.
5707347 5708975 Get down on your stomach.
5708975 5710481 You piece of shit. Now!
5711150 5712914 All the way. All the way...
5712914 5714476 fucker. Down.
5714476 5715918 Faster.
5715918 5718150 Faster, fucker. Now.
5718150 5719987 Nose on the ground.
5723230 5726324 Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?
5726324 5729561 I'd like to speak<br />to my lawyer, please.
5731271 5732601 Goddamn it.
5734842 5739436 He cuts the skin off the tips of his<br />fingers. That's why we couldn't...
5739436 5741672 find 1 print in his apartment.
5741672 5744012 Seems he's done that for a while.
5744012 5746677 What about the bank accounts?<br />The guns?
5746677 5748847 So far everything is a dead end.
5748847 5751686 No credit history.<br />No employment records.
5751686 5754954 A 5-year old bank account<br />opened with cash.
5754954 5757360 We've tried tracing his furniture.
5757360 5759124 All we know about him...
5759124 5761690 is that he's independently wealthy...
5762268 5763632 well-educated...
5763632 5765137 and totally insane.
5765137 5767637 Because he's John Doe by choice.
5768240 5772199 - When can we question him?<br />- You can't. He goes to court now.
5772199 5776476 There's no way he'd turn himself in.<br />It doesn't make any sense.
5776476 5777708 There he sits.
5777708 5780150 It's not supposed to make any sense.
5780150 5781481 He's not finished.
5781481 5784648 He's pissing in our faces<br />and we're taking it.
5785292 5787315 You know what I'm saying.
5787315 5791387 For the first time ever,<br />you and I are in total agreement.
5791387 5792989 He wouldn't just stop.
5792989 5795056 So what the fuck, man?
5795056 5798730 He's 2 murders away<br />from completing his masterpiece.
5799806 5801672 We'll wait for his plea.
5805079 5805212 My client says there're 2 more bodies.<br />Two more victims hidden away.
5805212 5809739 My client says there're 2 more bodies.<br />Two more victims hidden away.
5809739 5814844 He will take Detectives Mills and<br />Somerset to these bodies, only them...
5814844 5817014 and only at 6 o'clock today.
5817014 5818217 Why us?
5818824 5820521 He says he admires you.
5821927 5823690 It's part of the game.
5823690 5828030 If they don't accept this offer,<br />these bodies will never be found.
5828030 5830730 Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.
5832106 5833539 We've got him.
5833539 5836542 Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.
5836542 5839101 He'll get his free room and board,<br />cable TV.
5839101 5843204 My wife doesn't even have cable.<br />Why are we discussing this?
5843204 5847615 No. Something stinks. And this one--<br />You. In your $3,000 suit...
5847615 5852056 and that smug smile on your face.<br />Dealing for that piece of shit.
5852056 5853353 I don't like it.
5853353 5855360 The law requires me to serve...
5855360 5858954 my clients and their interests<br />as best I can.
5858954 5861226 We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.
5861226 5862789 My client informs you that...
5862789 5865565 if you do not accept,<br />he'll plead insanity.
5866472 5867905 Let him try it.
5868609 5869802 I'd like to see it.
5869802 5873811 We know with the extreme nature<br />of these crimes I'd get him off...
5873811 5875313 with such a plea.
5875313 5877940 I won't let this conviction slide.
5877940 5881976 If you do accept under<br />his specific conditions, he'll sign...
5881976 5884820 a full confession,<br />plead guilty right now.
5885225 5887454 It's your case.<br />Make a decision.
5889061 5890655 Full confession.
5890655 5891923 I'm in.
5891923 5893829 It must be both of you.
5895168 5897431 If he were to claim insanity...
5897431 5900337 this conversation is admissible.
5900739 5902833 That he's blackmailing us<br />with his plea.
5902833 5905936 My client wants to remind you,<br />2 more are dead.
5905936 5909503 The press'd love to find out<br />the police weren't concerned...
5909503 5911949 about finding and burying them.
5911949 5914179 If in fact there are 2 more dead.
5914179 5915914 The lab report came.
5915914 5918685 They did a quickie on<br />Doe's clothing and fingernails.
5918685 5922284 They found blood from Doe's fingers,<br />blood from...
5922284 5925797 the woman who's face he cut off,<br />and blood from...
5925797 5927458 a third party...
5927458 5929364 as yet unidentified.
5932771 5935137 You'd be escorting an unarmed man.
5938043 5939672 Let's finish it.
5943382 5946409 If John Doe's head splits open<br />and a UFO flies out...
5946409 5948819 I want you to expect it.
5950722 5951985 I will.
5954793 5959664 If I accidentally shaved off a nipple,<br />would it be covered by workman's comp?
5964237 5965670 I suppose so.
5967306 5970172 If you were man enough<br />to file a claim...
5970172 5973042 I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.
5974079 5977277 I keep coming home late,<br />my wife'll think something's up.
5986324 5987350 You know...
5988829 5989851 Yeah.
5995936 5996923 What?
6067074 6068837 Will this wind hurt us?
6118123 6119351 Who are you, John?
6120293 6121726 Who are you really?
6122295 6123728 What do you mean?
6123728 6127699 At this stage, what harm can it do<br />to tell us about yourself?
6127699 6131396 Doesn't matter who I am.<br />Who I am means absolutely nothing.
6131396 6133302 Stay on your left up here.
6137311 6138503 Where are we heading?
6139744 6140972 You'll see.
6141579 6144846 We're not just going to pick up<br />2 more bodies, are we?
6145485 6147748 That wouldn't be shocking enough.
6147748 6150583 You've got newspapers<br />to think about, yeah?
6151891 6154257 Wanting people to listen...
6154257 6155588 you can't just...
6155588 6158096 tap them on the shoulder anymore.
6158096 6160655 You have to use a sledgehammer.
6160655 6163668 Then you'll get<br />their strict attention.
6163668 6165329 But the question is:
6165806 6168603 Why're you so special<br />that people should listen?
6168603 6170164 I'm not special.
6171177 6173271 I've never been exceptional.
6173914 6176677 This is, though. What I'm doing.
6176677 6177909 My work.
6177909 6179645 Your work, John?
6179645 6180914 Yes.
6181420 6184413 See, I don't see anything special<br />about it, John.
6185592 6186989 That's not true.
6186989 6190860 No, it is true. And the funny<br />thing is, all this work...
6191262 6195757 in 2 months, no one'll care,<br />or give a shit, or even remember.
6196369 6198860 You can't see the whole complete<br />act yet.
6199873 6201636 But when this is done...
6202874 6204342 when it's finished...
6205945 6207673 it's going to be...
6210548 6213485 People will barely be able<br />to comprehend.
6213954 6216217 But they won't be able to deny.
6217623 6219319 Could the freak be more vague?
6220293 6221954 As far as master plans go...
6222628 6224891 I really can't wait for you to see.
6224891 6226726 It's going to be something.
6227734 6230565 Know what?<br />I'll be standing next to you.
6230565 6233900 So when this thing happens,<br />be sure and let me know.
6233900 6235440 Don't want to miss it.
6235440 6237168 Oh, don't worry.
6237576 6238838 You won't.
6240746 6242681 You won't miss a thing.
6269441 6270931 What's so exciting?
6272012 6274137 It's not too far now.
6281353 6285882 I've tried to figure something in my<br />head. Maybe you can help me out.
6287659 6291597 When a person is insane,<br />as you clearly are, do you know...
6292030 6293556 that you're insane?
6294301 6296199 Maybe you're reading...
6296199 6298396 masturbating in your own feces...
6298396 6300463 Do you just stop and go:
6300463 6304133 "Wow, it's amazing how fucking crazy<br />I really am"?
6304133 6306905 You know? Do you guys do that?
6307313 6310306 It's more comfortable<br />for you to label me insane.
6310306 6311645 It's very comfortable.
6312319 6315481 It's not something I would expect<br />you to accept.
6315989 6319083 But I did not choose. I was chosen.
6319083 6320319 Whatever.
6320319 6322655 I don't doubt that you believe that.
6323396 6325420 but it seems that you're...
6325420 6327592 overlooking a contradiction.
6327592 6329065 Meaning what?
6330070 6331661 Glad you asked.
6333338 6335101 If you were chosen...
6335101 6337609 that is, by a higher...
6337609 6339610 power...
6339610 6341771 and if your hand was forced...
6342181 6345514 it seems strange to me<br />that you'd get such enjoyment.
6345918 6348444 You enjoyed torturing those people.
6349521 6352686 That doesn't seem to fit<br />with martyrdom, does it?
6354194 6355353 John?
6360266 6365034 I doubt I enjoyed it more than Det.<br />Mills would enjoy time alone with me...
6365034 6366798 in a room without windows.
6367672 6369039 Isn't that true?
6369609 6371042 How'd you like to...
6371042 6374137 - hurt me with impunity?<br />- That hurts my feelings.
6374137 6375976 I would never.
6375976 6378811 You wouldn't only because<br />there's consequences.
6379953 6382978 It's in those eyes of yours, though.
6382978 6385717 Nothing wrong with a man<br />taking pleasure in his work.
6386293 6389159 I won't deny my own personal desire...
6389159 6391389 to turn each sin against<br />the sinner.
6391963 6395661 Wait a minute, I thought all you did<br />was kill innocent people.
6397637 6400333 Innocent? Is that supposed<br />to be funny?
6401074 6402735 An obese man.
6402735 6405333 Disgusting man who could barely stand.
6405333 6409905 You'd point him out to your friends<br />so that they'd join you in mocking him.
6409905 6414418 If you saw him while you ate,<br />you couldn't finish your meal.
6415155 6418715 Then the lawyer. You had to<br />secretly thank me for that.
6419092 6422186 This is a man who dedicated<br />his life...
6422186 6427029 to making money by lying with every<br />breath he could muster to keep...
6427029 6429034 murderers and rapists...
6429034 6430762 - on the streets.<br />- Murderers?
6431670 6433900 - Murderers, like yourself?<br />- A woman...
6433900 6436873 so ugly inside that she<br />couldn't go on living...
6436873 6439275 if she couldn't be beautiful outside?
6439275 6443713 A drug dealer. A pederast, actually.<br />Let's not forget...
6443713 6446579 the disease-spreading whore.
6448820 6451289 Only in a world this shitty...
6451289 6455190 could you say they were innocent<br />and keep a straight face.
6458197 6459891 But that's the point.
6461301 6464463 We see a deadly sin<br />on every street corner...
6464463 6466061 in every home and we...
6466539 6467471 tolerate it.
6468039 6470804 We tolerate it because it's common.
6470804 6472310 It's trivial.
6472878 6475472 We tolerate it morning,<br />noon and night.
6478883 6480579 Well, not anymore.
6483056 6484920 I'm setting the example.
6486493 6488255 And what I've done will be...
6488255 6489659 puzzled over...
6490163 6491652 and studied...
6492831 6494264 and followed...
6496069 6497262 forever.
6498003 6499266 Yeah.
6500507 6501735 Delusions of grandeur.
6503842 6505606 You should be thanking me.
6506079 6507444 Why's that, John?
6507444 6510677 Because you'll be remembered<br />after this.
6510677 6514686 Realize, Detective, the only reason<br />that I'm here now...
6514686 6516847 is that I wanted to be.
6516847 6519619 No. We would have got you eventually.
6519619 6521124 Oh, really?
6521124 6525426 So what were you doing,<br />biding your time? Toying with me?
6525931 6529025 Allowing 5 "innocent" people<br />to die until...
6529025 6531534 you felt like springing your trap?
6531534 6533538 What was the indisputable...
6533538 6536632 evidence you were going to use on me,<br />right before...
6536632 6540373 I walked up to you and put my hands<br />in the air?
6540373 6542641 John. Calm down.
6542641 6545206 I remember us knocking on your door.
6546119 6547484 That's right.
6547484 6550887 And I seem to remember<br />breaking your face.
6555395 6557954 You're only alive<br />because I didn't kill you.
6557954 6559726 Okay. Sit back.
6559726 6561824 - I spared you.<br />- Sit back.
6561824 6564391 Remember that when you<br />look in the mirror...
6564391 6566664 for the rest of your life...
6566664 6570231 or should I say for the rest<br />of what life I allow you...
6570231 6571673 to have.
6571673 6573677 Sit back, you fucking freak!
6573677 6575304 Shut your fucking mouth!
6576815 6581253 You're no messiah. You're a movie<br />of the week. A fucking tee shirt...
6581654 6583177 at best.
6596436 6598766 Don't ask me to pity those people.
6598766 6603206 I don't mourn them any more than the<br />1000's that died at Sodom & Gomorrah.
6603206 6607871 Is that to say, John, that what<br />you were doing was God's good work?
6611115 6613880 The Lord works in mysterious ways.
6616121 6618556 Do you see those high-tension towers?
6618556 6620454 That's where we're headed.
6620454 6623119 I see it. 9 o'clock,<br />and follow that road.
6637310 6640141 There sure as shit is no ambush<br />out here.
6640141 6642306 No fucking nothing out here.
6643148 6646311 They'll come up behind us in about<br />2 minutes.
6646311 6648478 I want you to go way up.
6648478 6651922 In thirty seconds, bank east<br />on my mark. Thirty seconds.
6713887 6714819 I'll get him.
6721726 6722887 Get out.
6723795 6725056 Slowly.
6725797 6726990 Stop.
6727798 6729061 Stay.
6732237 6733498 What do you got?
6735074 6736335 A dead dog.
6738076 6739806 I didn't do that.
6746485 6747679 What time is it?
6748487 6749351 Why?
6749755 6751155 I'd like to know.
6754494 6755585 7:01.
6758829 6759989 It's close.
6760932 6762195 Let's go take a look.
6765838 6767030 It's this way.
6815487 6817752 Down. Down. Down.
6819490 6820650 Watch him.
6822226 6823284 There he goes.
6824396 6826556 It's good we have<br />some time to talk.
6832704 6835639 The guy in red.<br />Keep the crosshairs on him.
6843248 6844771 A van's coming down the road.
6845182 6846275 From the north.
6855659 6859619 Be ready for anything.<br />Wait for my signal. Wait for me.
6865436 6866462 Get out!
6869106 6870132 Out!
6870132 6872369 Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.
6872369 6873706 Step away.
6874445 6876436 Turn around. Hands on your head.
6877048 6878277 What's going on?
6879217 6880378 Why are you here?
6880378 6884387 I'm delivering a package<br />for this guy, David.
6884387 6885820 Detective...
6885820 6887154 David Mills.
6894298 6896234 Get it. Slowly.
6908880 6911576 A guy paid me $500<br />to bring it out here.
6911576 6913846 He wanted it here at exactly<br />7 o'clock.
6914418 6915681 Put it down.
6916822 6918186 We got a box.
6918186 6920851 We got a box.<br />Call the bomb squad.
6920851 6922552 Bomb squad. We got a box.
6922552 6924186 Face the van.
6924931 6926090 Hands up.
6933838 6934704 Turn.
6936373 6937704 Okay. Go.
6937704 6939266 Off you go. Go.
6941481 6943574 I'm sending the driver out on foot.
6947219 6948652 He's headed north, along the road.
6948652 6949981 Have him picked up.
6959664 6961257 Oh, I don't know.<br />I don't know.
6967838 6969329 I'm going to open it.
6969329 6972605 When I said I admired you,<br />I meant what I said.
6992063 6993121 It's blood.
6993121 6995793 You've made quite a life for yourself,<br />Detective.
6995793 6999463 - You should be very proud.<br />- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
7027132 7028655 California, stay away from here.
7028655 7031328 Stay away from here, now.<br />Don't, don't, don't come in here.
7031328 7033463 Whatever you hear, stay away.
7034405 7036498 John Doe has the upper hand.
7038076 7039407 Here he comes.
7039407 7041411 - Throw your gun down!<br />- What?
7041411 7043673 - I wish I could have lived like you.<br />- Shut up.
7043673 7044941 What the fuck you talkin' about?
7046485 7048315 Do you hear me, Detective?
7048315 7050047 I'm trying to tell you how much...
7050047 7052612 I admire you and your pretty wife.
7053557 7054717 What?
7054717 7055987 Tracy.
7056896 7059489 - What'd you fucking say?<br />- It's disturbing...
7059489 7062498 how easily a member of the press<br />can purchase...
7062498 7064502 information from the men<br />in your precinct.
7064502 7066400 What the fuck?
7066400 7068667 Throw your gun down!
7068667 7070731 I visited your home this morning...
7071576 7073237 after you left.
7074079 7075877 I tried to play husband.
7076414 7080008 I tried to taste the life<br />of a simple man.
7080008 7081347 Throw it away!
7081347 7083579 It didn't work out.
7083579 7085418 So...
7085418 7087423 I took a souvenir.
7089094 7090994 Her pretty head.
7095833 7098360 - What's, what's he talking about?<br />- Give me the gun.
7098360 7099699 What's goin' on over there?
7099699 7101797 Would you... Put the gun down.
7101797 7103271 I saw you with the box.<br />What was in the box?
7103271 7105206 Because I envy your normal life.
7105206 7106436 Put the gun down, David.
7106436 7108377 It seems that envy is my sin.
7108377 7110380 - What's in the box?<br />- Not until you give me the gun.
7110380 7111882 What's in the fucking box?
7112284 7113945 He just told you.
7113945 7117181 You lie! You're a fucking liar!<br />Shut up!
7117521 7120686 That's what he wants. He wan--<br />He wants you to shoot him.
7124762 7126195 No! No. You tell me.<br />You tell me that's not true.
7126195 7128458 - That's not true.<br />- Become vengeance, David.
7128458 7129795 She's all right. You tell me.
7129795 7131061 Become...
7131061 7132228 wrath.
7132228 7133463 Tell me she's all right!
7134039 7135563 If you murder a suspect, David...
7136874 7138967 you just throw it all away<br />and he knows it.
7139610 7141739 - She begged for her life, Detective.<br />- Shut up!
7141739 7144078 She begged for her life...
7144078 7146141 and for the life of the baby<br />inside of her.
7164668 7165999 He didn't know.
7179851 7181512 Give me the gun, David.
7189527 7191119 If you kill him...
7192597 7193963 he will win.
7198270 7200133 Oh God!
