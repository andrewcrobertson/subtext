58177 61228 Neighbors heard them screaming<br />at each other, like, for two hours.
61318 63591 Nothing new.<br />Then they heard the gun go off.
63681 64849 Both barrels.
66227 67708 A crime of passion.
68646 69862 Yeah.
70314 72921 Just look at all the passion<br />on that wall.
73011 75798 Yeah, well, this is a done deal.<br />All but the paperwork.
80282 81537 The kid see it?
81627 82730 What?
83452 84572 The kid.
85287 86860 What kind of fucking question is that?
88200 90121 We are all gonna be real glad...
90211 92761 ...when we get rid of you,<br />Somerset, you know that?
92851 95380 There's always these questions<br />with you. Did the kid see it?
95471 98712 Who gives a fuck? He's dead.<br />His wife killed him.
98803 101212 Anything else has<br />nothing to do with us.
109809 111233 Detective Somerset?
113274 114809 I'm Detective Mills.
114899 117714 Lieutenant, I apologize<br />for interrupting like this...
117804 120459 ...just get in town 20 minutes ago,<br />they dump me here.
120549 122170 Look...
122260 123541 Mills?
123631 126096 I thought we might<br />find a bar someplace. Sit, talk...
126186 128490 I'd like to get to the precinct.
128581 131198 You know, not much time for<br />this transition thing.
132684 135398 I meant to ask you something,<br />when we spoke on the phone before.
135489 136603 Yeah.
138309 139718 Why here?
139808 141637 I don't follow.
141728 144305 Well, all this effort<br />to get transferred.
145817 148858 It's the first question<br />that popped into my head.
148948 150845 I guess for the same reasons as you.
150945 153663 Or the same reasons you had<br />before you decided to quit, yeah?
156066 157698 You just met me.
158944 160906 Maybe I'm not understanding<br />the question.
162531 163770 It's very simple.
164793 168309 You actually fought<br />to get reassigned here.
169330 171387 I've just never seen it done<br />that way before.
171477 173844 I thought I could do some good.<br />It would be great...
173935 176951 ...if we didn't start out<br />kicking each other in the balls.
179283 180509 If you're calling the<br />shots, lieutenant...
180600 181705 Yes.
182965 186314 I want you to look<br />and I want you to listen, okay?
186404 189093 Now, I wasn't standing around<br />guarding the Taco Bell.
189183 191268 - I've worked Homicide five years.<br />- Not here.
191359 192360 I understand that.
192450 194256 Well, over the next<br />seven days, detective,...
194347 196771 ...you'll do me the favor<br />of remembering that.
208782 211534 Hey, hey. I almost died.
234933 237143 Shut the fuck up down there!
421285 423422 Hello? Yeah.
423512 424930 Okay.
425790 427291 Say it again.
429877 433808 I thought we moved here<br />to get away from tractor pulls.
439095 441235 Serpico's gotta go.
441325 445320 Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid<br />of this little crusty.
445410 447117 This eye, Serpico.
447207 448735 - Did you get it?<br />- Got it.
448825 449895 Good.
466581 468430 Coffee? No?
472378 475531 Nothing's been touched.<br />Everything's like I found it.
475621 477372 What time was death established?
477462 479013 Like I said...
479103 480667 ...I didn't touch anything.
481220 484683 But he's had his face in a plate of<br />spaghetti for about 45 minutes now.
484773 487607 Wait a minute.<br />No one bothers with vital signs?
487697 488979 Did I stutter?
489069 492529 This guy ain't breathing unless he<br />started breathing spaghetti sauce.
492619 495924 - So that's how it's done around here?<br />- I beg your pardon, detective.
496014 498909 But this guy's been sitting<br />in a pile of his own piss and shit.
498999 501334 If he wasn't dead,<br />he would've stood up by now.
501424 503901 - All right, thank you, officer.<br />- Okay.
503992 505378 Thank you.
515171 516491 I wonder.
518818 521096 What exactly was the point<br />of the conversation...
521186 523075 ...you were about to get into?
523165 524208 Don't know.
524299 527906 How many times has Barney Fife<br />found dead bodies that weren't dead?
529755 531221 Drop it.
561175 565163 Somebody phone Guinness.<br />I think we've got a record here.
581654 584031 <i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>
594625 596085 Who said this was murder?
596669 598129 No one.
599932 602960 Guy's heart's gotta be the size<br />of a canned ham.
606095 611691 If this isn't a coronary,<br />well, I don't know.
637084 639115 How about that?
649138 650840 We had this case once.
652016 653997 Guy dead on the ground.
654087 655368 Knife in his back.
655458 657090 Gotta be murder, right?
659273 660316 Fuck.
661150 663748 Anyway,<br />big insurance policy involved, yeah?
663838 668661 So the guy took the tip of the blade,<br />stuck it in his own shoulder blades.
668751 671118 And he must've screwed up a few<br />times because there was...
671208 672478 ...multiples back there.
672569 674111 Could you please be quiet?
684006 685301 Wait a minute.
685391 686595 What?
689220 690764 Got a bucket here.
691806 692944 What's in it?
698826 699936 God.
700027 701499 Fucking vomit.
704110 705549 Any blood in it?
705903 708302 I didn't see any. Help yourself.
713540 715453 Are you thinking it's poison?
716706 719144 Wonderful. Very moody.
719234 720974 Thinking it's poison, Somerset?
721064 724613 You girls have got Forensics<br />waiting outside.
724703 728612 - Don't know if we'll all fit, though.<br />- There's room, light's the problem.
728702 730595 - Hi, how are you?<br />- Hey.
730685 734676 Detective Mills, would you go help<br />the officers question the neighbors?
737392 738441 What?
738532 740487 Send in Forensics on<br />your way out, please.
756078 757509 He's dead.
758956 760555 Thank you, doctor.
766547 770227 You've seen my files, right?<br />You seen the things I've done.
770317 771669 Nope.
774138 776617 I did my time on door-to-doors<br />and walking the beat.
776708 778569 I did that shit for a long time.
779894 780986 And?
781076 784729 Badge on my belt says "detective."<br />That's the same as yours.
785858 788463 Look, I made a decision.
788553 791410 I had to consider<br />the integrity of the scene.
791500 793448 Couldn't worry whether you thought<br />you were getting enough...
793538 795131 ...on the playing field.
795221 796635 Hey, man...
797995 801554 ...just don't be jerking me off,<br />that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
808172 809903 He's been dead a long time.
809993 812124 And I can tell you,<br />it was not from poison.
812214 813642 Man.
813732 816387 How does someone<br />let themselves go like that?
816478 819321 It took four orderlies<br />just to get him on the table.
822311 824745 How'd the fat fuck<br />ever fit out his front door?
824835 827213 Please. It's obvious he was a shut-in.
827303 828678 Now, look at this.
828768 830461 See how big this stomach is?
830551 833334 And the strange thing<br />is, it stretches.
833424 836636 Here. Look at the size of the<br />cardiac orifice, where the food...
836727 839704 Wait, I see what you're pointing out,<br />but that means nothing to me.
839794 843776 Okay. He's got lines of distention<br />across the duodenum.
843867 846179 And the interior wall is ripped open.
847002 849367 This man ate till he burst?
849457 852079 He didn't really burst.<br />Not all the way.
852169 854630 He was hemorrhaging internally.
854721 858875 And there was a hematoma in the rectus<br />and transverse abdominis muscles.
858965 860416 So he did die by eating.
860507 861815 Yes and no.
864061 865956 What about these bruises up here?
867690 869657 Well, I haven't figured that out yet.
869747 871678 Gun pressed against his head?
871768 873103 Pressed hard enough, sure.
873194 874713 Fuck, yeah.
874803 877341 Marks from the front side,<br />flush with the muzzle.
879577 882713 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have ourselves a homicide.
885958 888787 Killer put a bucket beneath him,<br />kept on serving.
888877 890361 Took his time, too.
890451 893517 Coroner said this could've gone on<br />more than 12 hours.
893607 896666 Victim's throat was swollen,<br />probably from the effort.
896756 899780 And there was definitely a point<br />when he passed out.
899870 902492 That's when the killer kicked him<br />and he burst.
902582 904624 Sadistic fucker.
904714 907191 When you want somebody<br />dead, you drive by and shoot.
907281 910372 You don't risk the time it takes<br />to do this.
910462 913575 - Unless the act itself has meaning.<br />- Come on.
913665 917314 Somebody had a problem with the fat<br />boy and decided to torture him.
917404 918486 Simple as that.
918576 920640 In the grocery bags,<br />we found two receipts.
920730 923195 That means the killer stopped<br />in the middle...
923285 925495 ...and made a second trip<br />to the supermarket.
925585 926799 So?
928000 931332 Hey, man, it's his thing.<br />I've been out in the rain all day.
931422 932905 This is beginning.
932995 935617 We've got one dead guy, not three.
935707 937101 No motive.
937850 941486 Don't even start that big brain of<br />yours cooking on this, all right?
941576 944445 Please, I'd like to be reassigned.
944535 945682 - What?<br />- What?
945772 946772 What?
946863 949144 What in the hell are<br />you talking about?
949234 951555 This can't be my last duty.
951645 953518 It's just gonna go on and on and on.
953609 954758 You're retiring.
954848 957381 Six more days<br />and you're all the way gone.
957471 959323 Won't be the first time<br />you've left unfinished...
959413 963140 Those other cases were taken as close<br />to conclusion as humanly possible.
963230 964691 And if I may speak freely?
964781 966421 We're all friends here.
966511 968125 This should not be<br />his first assignment.
968215 969903 Come on, I knew it.
969993 972156 This is not my first<br />assignment, you dick.
972246 973463 It's too soon for him.
973553 976399 Hey, man, I'm right here.<br />You can say that shit to my face.
976490 978429 - Captain...<br />- It's too soon for you.
979468 981845 Captain, if we can<br />just talk in private?
981935 983978 This isn't working.<br />It's a personal thing.
984069 985818 - Maybe...<br />- Just shut up, Mills.
985908 989914 Look, I don't have anyone else<br />to put on this and you know it.
990004 992798 This is Metro. You don't<br />just get to swap.
992889 994713 Give it to me.
994803 996936 - Say what?<br />- Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.
997027 999113 Sorry, but see you later.<br />Have a nice time.
999203 1000203 Give it to me.
1000294 1002609 No, I'm putting you<br />on something else.
1004712 1006231 Go on, Mills.
1006322 1007677 Just go on.
1013068 1015227 I'm sorry, old buddy.
1015318 1018478 But it looks like you're stuck<br />cleaning up the fat man.
1035383 1037793 All right, here we go. Quiet down.
1038803 1041700 All right, calm down. Calm down.
1041790 1043787 Quiet down.
1043877 1045963 Calm down. Quiet down.
1046054 1048858 Now, here's how it's gonna work.
1048948 1053117 I'll answer questions for 10 minutes<br />and 10 minutes only.
1053207 1056544 If those questions do not come in a<br />calm, sane and orderly fashion...
1056635 1058028 ...I'm on my way out here.
1058118 1060037 Detective? Detective?
1060128 1062388 - Can I have a moment of your time?<br />- No.
1067183 1070319 I will not discuss the details<br />of this ongoing investigation...
1070409 1072131 ...so don't even bother asking.
1074023 1075963 <i>I've got shopping tools....</i>
1076053 1078291 <i>That's 25 Berlin.</i>
1083283 1085076 That looks like him.
1087036 1089293 <i>Three items for your case number.</i>
1091332 1094114 - What you guys got for me?<br />- Nothing yet, boss.
1097630 1101238 Why don't you guys,<br />go get a coffee?
1102343 1104445 <i>We have this breaking story for you.</i>
1104535 1106488 <i>We're going to go live downtown...</i>
1106578 1109959 <i>...where defense attorney Eli Gould<br />was found murdered this morning.</i>
1110050 1113904 <i>District Attorney Martin Talbot<br />is taking questions from reporters.</i>
1115523 1117856 <i>There could be a<br />conflict of interest...</i>
1117946 1120111 <i>That is ridiculous to the<br />point of being offensive.</i>
1120201 1122258 <i>There is no conflict whatsoever.</i>
1122348 1124378 <i>And any claim that there could be...</i>
1124468 1126258 <i>- ...is irresponsible.</i><br /><i>- Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.</i>
1126348 1128329 <i>- Hold on.</i><br /><i>- It's rumored you're far...</i>
1128419 1131184 <i>- ...from apprehending a suspect.</i><br /><i>- I've come from a meeting...</i>
1131275 1134309 <i>...of law enforcement officials<br />and they've assured me...</i>
1134876 1137861 <i>...they have their<br />very best men on this.</i>
1137961 1143599 <i>This will be the very definition<br />of swift justice.</i>
1167033 1168743 Pardon me, George.
1173122 1175708 - Somerset.<br />- Come in.
1176709 1179512 - Have you heard the news?<br />- Nope, haven't heard.
1179602 1182459 Eli Gould was found murdered<br />this morning.
1182549 1186343 Someone broke into his law firm<br />and bled him to death.
1186433 1189175 Wrote the word "greed" on the floor.
1194936 1197653 - Greed?<br />- Yeah, in blood.
1198143 1200654 Mills is heading up the investigation.
1200744 1203087 Excuse me. Excuse me?
1203945 1205613 Could you not do that, please?
1205704 1207023 Okay.
1208283 1210227 Well, good for him.
1210317 1213698 What in the hell are you gonna do<br />with yourself out there, Somerset?
1213788 1215986 I'll work, maybe on a farm.
1216076 1217286 Fix my house.
1217377 1219055 Don't you feel it?
1219145 1221555 Don't you feel that feeling?
1221645 1224081 You're not gonna be a cop anymore.
1224735 1226169 That's the whole idea.
1228279 1230126 I don't think you're leaving.
1230216 1232348 Hell, you can't leave all this.
1234869 1236756 Guy's out walking his dog.
1236846 1238698 Gets attacked.
1238788 1241387 His watch is taken, his wallet.
1241477 1244458 While he's lying there<br />on the sidewalk, helpless...
1245296 1247987 ...his attacker stabs<br />him in both eyes.
1249759 1252394 This happened just last night<br />about four blocks from here.
1253512 1255506 Yeah, I read about it.
1255596 1257575 I don't understand<br />this place any longer.
1257666 1259479 It's the way it's always been.
1259569 1260641 Maybe you're right.
1260731 1262157 You do this work.
1262248 1265759 You were made for it<br />and I don't think you can deny that.
1266817 1268364 Maybe I'm wrong.
1269539 1272769 The coroner<br />sent this down for you.
1273616 1277570 Found them in fat boy's stomach,<br />mixed in with food.
1277640 1279891 Looks like plastic,<br />little pieces of plastic.
1279982 1281499 Set them on the desk, please.
1286003 1287448 They were....
1287538 1288970 They were fed to him.
1388606 1389986 Lord.
1397656 1400117 This was found on the wall<br />behind the refrigerator...
1400208 1401916 ...in the obesity murder scene.
1403465 1408335 "Long is the way and hard<br />that out of hell leads up to light."
1408425 1410038 It's from Milton.
1410461 1411857 <i>Paradise Lost.</i>
1412630 1414670 All right, I'm confused.
1414760 1417490 It means that this is beginning.
1418719 1421110 This was found<br />behind the same refrigerator.
1421200 1423097 Written in grease.
1423187 1425514 There are seven deadly sins, captain.
1426060 1427211 Gluttony.
1430022 1431087 Greed.
1433317 1437408 Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...
1438433 1439729 ...and envy.
1440449 1442539 - Seven.<br />- Hold on.
1442630 1444391 This is not even my desk.
1445871 1447887 You can expect five more of these.
1449708 1451039 Now, wait a minute.
1452336 1454345 I can't get involved in this.
1456799 1458331 Somerset.
1458422 1459660 He wanted it.
1461512 1464051 - Damn.<br />- I'm all over it.
1465557 1467647 What's wrong with you?
1498215 1499623 Where you headed?
1502720 1504319 Far away from here.
1514148 1516568 - Thanks, George.<br />- How you doing?
1516658 1518342 Just a few things to look up.
1518432 1520773 Okay. Sit where you'd like.
1521739 1523248 How's everybody?
1524199 1525883 Hi, Smiley.
1526618 1528990 Come on, George,<br />the cards are getting cold.
1529081 1530456 Duty calls.
1546513 1548599 Gentlemen, gentlemen.
1549099 1550774 I'll never understand.
1551769 1553387 All these books...
1553477 1555876 ...a world of knowledge<br />at your fingertips.
1555966 1557740 What do you do?
1557831 1559860 You play poker all night.
1559950 1561845 Hey, we got culture.
1561935 1564009 Yeah, we got culture<br />coming out of our asses.
1566283 1567996 All right.
1568086 1570204 How's this for culture?
1727819 1730028 You know, Smiley...
1730118 1732047 ...you're really gonna miss us.
1733700 1735246 I just might.
1793010 1795139 Fucking Dante.
1795229 1799265 Goddamn poetry-writing faggot<br />piece of shit.
1799700 1801104 Fucker.
1809192 1810273 Yeah?
1812070 1813540 Good work, officer.
1820871 1822358 Thank you, Lord.
1830213 1831832 I'm sorry.
1833508 1835098 Be out of your way in a second.
1847814 1849983 - You want your chair?<br />- No. You go ahead.
1850074 1851407 Yeah?
1890148 1891243 Phone.
1892109 1894382 It's a package deal.<br />Comes with the office.
1899658 1901439 - Mills.<br /><i>- Honey.</i>
1902619 1905228 - Are you okay, something wrong?<br /><i>- No.</i>
1905319 1909662 You dingleberry, I, told you<br />not to call me here when I'm working.
1910627 1912394 Yeah. Why?
1912484 1913888 Why?
1914715 1917509 - Why?<br /><i>- Come on.</i>
1920887 1922482 Okay.
1926143 1927505 It's my wife.
1927595 1928768 Sorry?
1930147 1931663 She'd like to speak to you.
1941032 1943487 This is Detective Somerset.
1943577 1945574 <i>It's nice to speak with you.</i>
1945664 1948434 Well, it's nice to talk to you too.
1950000 1952309 I appreciate the offer, but...
1955046 1958186 - Well, in that case I'd be delighted.<br /><i>- Great.</i>
1958276 1961333 - Yes, thank you very much.<br /><i>- Thank you. See you later.</i>
1961423 1962610 Bye.
1965265 1966568 Hon, what...?
1974691 1976065 Well?
1976155 1978588 - Sorry?<br />- What?
1978678 1981333 I've been invited to a late supper<br />at your apartment.
1981423 1982929 I accepted.
1983019 1985105 At my... How's that?
1985553 1986836 Tonight.
1988580 1990372 <i>Twenty-one-fifty-seven.</i>
1993668 1995768 Hello, men.
1995859 1997781 - Hi, loser.<br />- Hi, idiot.
1999716 2001278 This is Tracy.
2002135 2003970 - Somerset.<br />- Hello.
2004429 2007611 I'm very happy to meet you.<br />I've heard a lot about you.
2008099 2010343 Except, of course, your first name.
2011436 2012961 It's William.
2013491 2016734 Well, it's a good name, William.
2017651 2019894 William, I'd like you to meet David.
2019984 2022314 - David, this is William.<br />- Okay, all right, I'm gonna...
2022404 2023588 I'll be right back.
2023678 2025932 - How are the kids?<br />- Good, they're in the room.
2026023 2027207 Come on in.
2028787 2030519 Good dogs.
2030610 2033593 How are you, good dogs?<br />How are you, pretty?
2035502 2037042 How are you?
2039047 2040496 How are you?
2041424 2042747 You are?
2044469 2046195 - Smells good.<br />- What?
2048069 2050025 Yeah. I mean, thank you.
2051701 2054713 Please have a seat, if you like.<br />Would you like something to drink?
2054803 2056512 No. No, thanks.
2056602 2057690 I'll wait.
2057780 2059349 Okay, you can just<br />throw that anywhere.
2059440 2063106 You'll have to excuse all this mess.<br />You know, we're still unpacking.
2065866 2068201 I understand you two<br />were high school sweethearts.
2070912 2072426 Pretty hokey?
2073665 2075563 You know something?
2075653 2078900 I knew on our first date that this<br />was the guy I was gonna marry.
2078990 2080160 Really?
2081298 2083590 He was the funniest guy I'd ever met.
2088388 2089533 Really?
2092726 2094761 Well, it's kind of rare nowadays,<br />you know.
2095228 2098362 I mean, that level of commitment.
2103445 2104799 Don't worry.
2105447 2108432 - I won't wear it to the dinner table.<br />- No.
2108522 2112042 You know, no matter how<br />often I see guns, I just...
2112133 2114833 I can't get used to them.
2115957 2117258 Same here.
2127385 2129057 Why aren't you married, William?
2129147 2131353 Trace, what the hell?
2131443 2132928 I was close once.
2134309 2135731 It just didn't happen.
2135821 2137415 It surprises me.
2138063 2139580 It really does.
2141066 2142174 Well....
2143360 2147318 Anyone who spends a significant amount<br />of time with me finds me disagreeable.
2148573 2149983 Just ask your husband.
2150073 2151490 Very true.
2151580 2153107 Very, very true.
2154204 2156066 So how long have you lived here?
2157082 2158248 Too long.
2162281 2163490 How are you liking it?
2165126 2169027 You know, takes time, settle in.
2170497 2171946 It'll be good.
2172037 2174012 Well, you get numb after awhile.
2175543 2177323 There are things to any city.
2183510 2184886 Subway.
2184977 2187883 - It will go away in a minute.<br />- It's nothing.
2190892 2192856 Real estate guy.
2192939 2194458 Fucking piece of....
2194548 2196423 Sorry, honey. He's....
2196513 2198954 He shows us the place a few times.
2199044 2200921 I think he's good. He's efficient.
2201012 2202553 Tracy really likes him.
2203071 2205231 Then I start wondering why<br />will he only bring us here...
2205321 2207441 ...five minutes at a time, yeah?
2207531 2209559 We found out the first night.
2209650 2214251 The soothing, relaxing,<br />vibrating home?
2222966 2224249 I'm sorry.
2231474 2233363 Yeah, all right, laugh it up.
2236745 2238478 I don't know why you're laughing.
2242402 2244075 All right, already.
2248157 2249801 The guy would've had to get in...
2249902 2252516 ...before the office was closed<br />and security tightened.
2252606 2254536 Now, Gould would've been working late.
2254637 2257885 I'm certain. He was the biggest<br />defense lawyer in town.
2257975 2259018 Infamous, really.
2259109 2261270 Now listen,<br />body was found on Tuesday morning.
2261360 2263934 The office was closed on<br />Monday, which means...
2264024 2265905 ...the guy could've<br />gotten in Friday...
2265996 2267809 ...laid low till the<br />cleaning crew left...
2267899 2270117 ...then had his way with<br />Gould all day Saturday...
2270207 2272504 ...Sunday, maybe even Monday.
2273133 2274726 Hey, look at this.
2274816 2277170 Gould was bound, right<br />arm almost free.
2277261 2278770 He was handed a butcher's knife.
2280815 2282628 Check out the scale.
2282718 2284246 A pound of flesh?
2284336 2285607 Yeah.
2290992 2293760 "One pound of flesh,<br />No more, no less."
2293851 2297533 "No cartilage, no bone,<br />but only flesh."
2297624 2299752 <i>- Merchant of Venice.</i><br />- Didn't see it.
2299842 2303081 "This task done and he would go free."
2303171 2306429 I'm telling you that chair<br />was soaked through with sweat.
2306519 2308001 Of course.
2308676 2311278 The killer would've wanted Gould<br />to take his time...
2311754 2315413 ...to sit and decide<br />which cut to make first.
2315503 2317154 Imagine it.
2317255 2319028 There's a gun in your face.
2319771 2322021 Which part of your body is expendable?
2322483 2324643 What about the love handle?
2324733 2327133 Cut along the side of his own stomach.
2328231 2330793 All right, let's take a<br />fresh look at these.
2330883 2333281 Even though the corpse is there,<br />look through it.
2333371 2335090 Edit out the initial shock.
2335181 2340796 Trick is to find one item,<br />one detail and focus on it...
2340886 2343417 ...until it's an<br />exhausted possibility.
2343507 2345402 Just gonna get another beer. Beer?
2345493 2347117 Wine, please.
2356259 2357516 He's preaching.
2358136 2359333 He's punishing.
2361525 2364282 The sins were used<br />in medieval sermons.
2365394 2367917 There were seven cardinal virtues<br />and seven deadly sins...
2368007 2369565 ...used as teaching tools.
2369655 2372247 Yeah, yeah, yeah,<br />like in, <i>The Parson's Tale</i> and...
2372337 2373985 What's this? Dante.
2374075 2376317 - You read them?<br />- Yeah.
2376407 2379446 Well, parts.<br />Hey, remember in, <i>Purgatory?</i>
2379536 2381885 Dante and his buddy,<br />they're climbing up the hill...
2381975 2384430 ...they're checking out<br />all the sinners, yeah?
2384520 2386025 Yeah, the seven<br />terraces of purgation.
2386115 2387663 Yeah, yeah, right.
2388041 2391317 But there, pride comes<br />first, not gluttony.
2391407 2393128 Yeah, well, for now, let's<br />just consider that...
2393218 2395480 ...the books were the<br />killer's inspiration.
2395570 2398549 The sermons<br />were about atonement for sin.
2399344 2401530 These murders are like<br />forced attrition.
2402097 2404241 - Forced what?<br />- Attrition.
2404331 2407125 It's when you regret your sins,<br />but not because you love God.
2407216 2410292 Like because someone's sticking<br />a fucking gun in your face.
2414318 2416655 - No fingerprints.<br />- Nope.
2416745 2419525 - Totally unrelated victims.<br />- Yup.
2420282 2422779 And no witnesses of any kind.
2422869 2424665 Which I don't get.
2424755 2427772 Because the fucker<br />had to get back out.
2428498 2432427 Well, in any major city, minding<br />your own business is a science.
2433045 2437285 The first thing they teach women in<br />rape prevention is never cry for help.
2437898 2439528 Always yell "Fire."
2439618 2440994 Nobody answers to "Help."
2441085 2442980 You holler "fire," they come running.
2443430 2444911 That's fucked up.
2445002 2447668 He must've left another puzzle piece.
2449978 2451021 You know what?
2451112 2453988 Thank you for talking this out,<br />but I gotta sleep.
2454858 2455893 Walk the dogs.
2455983 2458247 This is just strictly<br />to satisfy my curiosity.
2458337 2459737 I'm still leaving at<br />the end of the week.
2459827 2461084 Shit.
2461175 2462614 No, wait, wait.
2464201 2466960 Gould's wife.<br />She was out of town at the time.
2467050 2470079 - So this means she saw something.<br />- What if it's a threat?
2470170 2474053 Well, I put her in a safe house.<br />She wasn't too happy about it.
2482343 2485056 What if it isn't<br />something she has seen?
2485146 2489234 But something she's supposed to see,<br />but hasn't been given a chance?
2489726 2491103 Yeah, okay. What?
2491426 2492854 I don't know.
2494669 2496494 But that's the one thing.
2541975 2543661 Sign us in.
2543751 2546458 Gotta see Mrs. Gould.
2546548 2548492 ...treat me like a prisoner.
2548583 2551987 Why do you have a phone if I can't<br />make long distance phone calls?
2552078 2554444 - Mrs. Gould?<br />- Don't treat people like this.
2559664 2562279 Mrs. Gould, I am sorry. I truly am.
2562951 2564692 I don't understand.
2565146 2569460 Okay, I need you<br />to look at each photo very carefully.
2570118 2574905 Look and see if there's anything<br />strange or out of place.
2574995 2576504 Anything at all.
2577257 2579339 - I don't see anything.<br />- You're sure?
2579429 2582002 Please, I just... I can't<br />do this right now.
2582092 2583707 Okay.
2584298 2585883 It's got to be now.
2585974 2588117 There may be something<br />we haven't seen.
2597321 2598548 Wait.
2598806 2600641 - What?<br />- Here.
2604318 2607414 This painting, it's upside down.
2615234 2617278 - You sure your men didn't move this?<br />- No, no.
2617369 2619927 Those shots were taken<br />before forensics.
2623242 2624578 Nothing.
2625619 2627570 There's gotta be something.
2638591 2641032 - Moved the screws to rehang it.<br />- Yep.
2645598 2646965 What the fuck is that?
2648559 2649946 Switchblade.
2658235 2659763 Goddamn it.
2663240 2665470 There must be something.
2670915 2672898 He didn't paint the fucking thing.
2681050 2683496 No, he's fucking with us,<br />that's what he's doing.
2685147 2687399 See this? This is us.
2687706 2688839 Yeah.
2688930 2690335 Just wait a minute.
2693062 2695246 Now Somerset's climbing<br />on the furniture.
2695337 2697085 Just wait a minute.
2702363 2704308 You're kidding me.
2704399 2706085 Call the Print Lab.
2711580 2713085 Man.
2716377 2720727 Honestly, have you ever<br />seen anything like this?
2722716 2723880 No.
2726178 2729230 I can tell you, guys, just by<br />looking at the swirl pattern...
2729321 2731292 ...they're not the<br />victim's fingerprints.
2742027 2745722 I don't know, man.<br />I say he's whacked enough.
2747825 2748951 It doesn't fit.
2749743 2751320 He doesn't wants<br />us to help him stop.
2751410 2752492 Who knows?
2752582 2756687 So many freaks out there doing their<br />little evil deeds they don't wanna do.
2756777 2759829 "The voices made me do it.<br />My dog made me do it."
2759919 2761676 "Jodie Foster told me to do it."
2761766 2765620 You know, I've seen this baby take as<br />long as three days to make a match...
2765710 2768517 ...so maybe you guys wanna cross<br />your fingers somewhere else.
2772683 2775424 You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,<br />didn't you?
2775514 2778725 - About catching this guy.<br />- Yeah.
2780900 2783263 Wish I still thought the way you do.
2784945 2788973 Why don't you tell me what the hell<br />it is you think we're doing then.
2789064 2790858 Picking up the pieces.
2792488 2797322 We're collecting all the evidence,<br />taking all the pictures and samples.
2797412 2799498 Writing everything down.
2799588 2801788 Noting the time things happened.
2803422 2805932 - That's all?<br />- That's all.
2806784 2810224 Putting everything into neat<br />little piles and filing it away.
2811096 2814337 On the off chance it will ever<br />be needed in the courtroom.
2817228 2820252 Picking up diamonds<br />on a deserted island.
2820343 2823566 Saving them in case we get rescued.
2826946 2828148 Bullshit.
2830491 2834237 Even the most promising clues<br />usually only lead to others.
2835788 2839659 So many corpses roll away unrevenged.
2842002 2845587 Don't try to tell me<br />you didn't get that rush tonight.
2846757 2848080 I saw you.
2849260 2851013 We're getting somewhere.
2866819 2868594 Wake up, Glimmer Twins.
2868685 2870193 You've got a winner.
2876340 2880223 This guy goes by the name of Victor.<br />His real name is Theodore Allen.
2880313 2883092 His prints were found<br />at the scene by Homicide.
2883182 2886552 He's got a long history<br />of serious mental illness.
2886642 2889889 His parents gave him a very strict<br />Southern Baptist upbringing.
2889979 2893014 But somewhere along the line,<br />they fell short.
2893104 2895865 Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,<br />armed robbery and assault.
2895955 2899576 Spent time in prison here a while back<br />for the attempted rape of a minor.
2899666 2902191 But his lawyer saw to it<br />that didn't last long.
2902281 2905078 His lawyer, by the way,<br />is the recently deceased Eli Gould.
2905168 2906875 - Greed murder victim.<br />- Yes, sir.
2906965 2909687 We're gonna finish this thing<br />up today, ladies and germs.
2909777 2912154 Victor's been out of<br />circulation a while,...
2912244 2913964 ...but there's still a<br />residence in his name.
2914054 2915815 You're not buying all this, are you?
2915906 2919435 - Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?<br />- You tell me.
2920450 2922704 Our killer seems to have more purpose.
2951570 2953281 You ever take a bullet?
2953371 2956381 Never in my 34 years, knock wood.
2958160 2961571 I've only taken my gun out three times<br />with the intention of using it.
2962373 2963761 Never pulled the trigger.
2963851 2965066 Not once.
2965912 2967098 You?
2967188 2969799 Yeah, but, no, I never<br />took a bullet,...
2969900 2973530 ...but I pulled my gun<br />once, shot it once.
2973620 2975722 - Really?<br />- It was my first one of these.
2975812 2978085 We were a secondary unit.
2978175 2981233 I was pretty shaky going in.<br />I was a rookie then.
2981323 2984788 Anyway, we bust open the door<br />looking for this junkie and...
2984878 2987293 ...the fucker just opened fire on us.
2987383 2989421 One cop got hit in the arm.
2991276 2993203 Christ, what was his name?
2994822 2996853 Spun him like a top.
2996944 2999462 You know,<br />I mean, more like slow motion.
3000703 3002070 I remember...
3003789 3005603 ...riding in that ambulance.
3005693 3008252 Well, he died right there.
3008794 3010111 Right there.
3010838 3013155 Christ, what was his fucking name?
3025853 3029267 - All rise.<br />- Let's do it.
3029898 3032441 Go, go. Move.
3034737 3036081 Okay.
3055551 3056978 Get up there.
3091102 3093447 SWAT goes before dicks.
3094296 3095506 Hey.
3097049 3098388 They love this.
3099718 3101287 Police.
3102471 3103740 Clear.
3105891 3107634 - Clear.<br />- Clear.
3107724 3109028 Clear.
3122241 3123434 Clear.
3131602 3133505 Morning, sweetheart.
3134419 3135921 Get up now, motherfucker.
3136012 3137270 Now!
3146375 3148066 Get up, you sack of shit.
3154944 3156387 Fuck me.
3156942 3160565 Dicks, you'll wanna<br />come take a look at this.
3163671 3165000 Dicks!
3172416 3173706 Jesus.
3173796 3175605 - Victor?<br />- What the hell?
3175695 3177467 Yeah, it's just Victor.
3177557 3179293 - Call an ambulance.<br />- What is this?
3179383 3181562 - Hearse more like it.<br />- Also Forensics.
3181652 3183899 - California, get your people out.<br />- Go on now.
3183989 3185659 No one touches anything.
3185749 3188122 It's some frigging wax sculpture<br />or something.
3192102 3193317 "Sloth."
3202931 3204182 Man.
3204273 3206185 Goddamn.
3206275 3208453 Those pictures were<br />dated three days ago.
3216864 3219094 This must be the first one. Look.
3220119 3222353 It's dated exactly one year ago today.
3224761 3230102 I got a hair sample, I got a stool<br />sample, I got piss, I got fingernails.
3232559 3236141 - He's laughing at us.<br />- You got what you deserved.
3239404 3241023 He's alive, he's alive!
3241114 3243006 - That cocksucker's alive!<br />- Guns down.
3243097 3244803 - Still breathing!<br />- Guns down!
3244894 3246850 Emergency on that ambulance!
3253983 3255409 Coming through.
3263450 3265904 - He's playing games.<br />- No shit.
3267328 3270625 Look, we have to divorce ourselves<br />from emotion here.
3271300 3273475 No matter how hard it is,<br />we have to remain focused.
3273565 3276053 Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.<br />How's that?
3276143 3278766 - Are you listening to me?<br />- Yes, I can hear you.
3278856 3280651 - Excuse me.<br />- What are you doing?
3280741 3283464 - Closed crime scene, get out.<br />- I got a right to be here.
3283554 3285011 - UPI photographer.<br />- Get out.
3285102 3287850 - I got a fucking right to be here.<br />- Get out of here.
3287940 3289933 - Get out. Jesus.<br />- Fucking jerk. Fuck you.
3290023 3291580 - I got your picture, man.<br />- Yeah?
3291670 3293197 - I got your picture.<br />- Yeah?
3293288 3296772 Detective Mills, M-I-L-L-S, fuck off.
3296862 3299687 - I'm surprised you can spell.<br />- Fuck you.
3299778 3301796 How do they get here so fucking quick?
3302655 3304655 They pay police for the information.
3304745 3306149 And they pay well.
3306826 3308765 Hey, man, I'm sorry, I....
3308855 3310257 Those....
3310825 3313553 - You know, they piss me off.<br />- It's okay.
3313644 3316460 It's impressive to see a man<br />feeding off his emotions.
3323134 3325064 A year of immobility<br />seems about right...
3325154 3328274 ...judging by the deterioration<br />of the muscles and the spine.
3328364 3331879 Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord<br />of drugs in his system.
3331969 3333441 Even an antibiotic...
3333532 3337659 ...which must've been administered<br />to keep the bed sores from infecting.
3337749 3341856 Now, has he tried to speak<br />or communicate in any way?
3341946 3344680 Even if his brain were not mush,<br />which it is...
3344771 3347267 ...he chewed off<br />his own tongue long ago.
3349199 3350567 Doc.
3352032 3354650 Is there absolutely no chance<br />that he might survive?
3355739 3358141 Detective, he'd die<br />of shock right now...
3358232 3360404 ...if you were to shine a<br />flashlight in his eyes.
3361174 3362917 He's experienced about as much pain...
3363007 3364886 ...and suffering as<br />anyone I've encountered.
3364977 3366207 Give or take.
3367209 3369708 And he still has hell<br />to look forward to.
3370238 3371469 Good night.
3372923 3375539 <i>Tonight we bring you<br />the Charlie Parker Quintet.</i>
3375629 3378731 <i>Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on<br />piano, Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...</i>
3378821 3381046 <i>...Jimmy Woode, bass,<br />Kenny Clarke, drums,...</i>
3381136 3383469 <i>...and the alto saxophone<br />of Charlie Parker.</i>
3383560 3385923 - Yeah?<br /><i>- Hello, William?</i>
3386201 3389451 <i>- It's Tracy.</i><br />- Tracy?
3390149 3394028 - Is everything all right?<br /><i>- Yeah, yes, everything's fine.</i>
3394653 3396410 - Where's David?<br /><i>- He's just ...</i>
3396500 3398895 <i>He's in the other room.<br />He's in the shower.</i>
3398985 3401904 <i> I'm sorry to call you like this.</i>
3401995 3403655 It's all right.
3404455 3406008 What can I do for you, Tracy?
3407541 3408744 I....
3411795 3413742 I need someone to talk to.
3413833 3417295 Do you think<br />you could meet me somewhere...
3417386 3418982 ...maybe tomorrow morning?
3420137 3421711 I don't understand.
3422931 3425742 <i>I feel stupid calling, but...</i>
3427102 3429898 ...you're the only person<br />that I know here.
3430647 3432150 There's no one else.
3432566 3436603 <i>If you can, just,<br />give me a call, okay?</i>
3436693 3438367 <i>I have to go now.</i>
3439323 3441303 <i>- Well, good night.</i><br />- Good night.
3450959 3454611 I mean, you know this city so well.
3454963 3458919 You've been here so long.
3459843 3462392 It can be a hard place.
3462482 3465231 I don't know why I asked you to come.
3466850 3469186 Why don't you talk to him about it?
3469277 3471098 Tell him how you feel.
3472189 3475067 I can't. You know, I<br />can't be a burden.
3475158 3476803 Especially now.
3479029 3481064 I'll get used to things.
3481154 3483231 You know? I think I just....
3483322 3487319 I wanted to talk to someone who's<br />lived here for a long time and....
3487955 3493624 I mean, upstate, you know, it's a<br />completely different environment.
3496839 3499434 Did David tell you<br />that I teach fifth grade?
3499524 3501261 Well, I did.
3502886 3504727 He mentioned it.
3508016 3511301 I've been going around,<br />you know, looking at schools.
3513397 3517182 But the conditions here are horrible.
3519027 3520445 What about private schools?
3523240 3524650 I don't know.
3526253 3529059 Why don't you tell me<br />what's really bothering you, Tracy.
3531582 3533756 David and I are gonna have a baby.
3538672 3540036 Tracy, I....
3541800 3543677 I don't think I'm the...
3543768 3546200 I'm the one to talk to about this.
3546291 3548067 I hate this city.
3552352 3554277 I had a relationship once.
3555272 3556970 It was very much like a marriage.
3560235 3561640 We got pregnant.
3563071 3564970 This was a long time ago.
3570996 3573933 I remember getting up one morning<br />and going to work.
3576126 3577888 Just another day like<br />any other, except...
3577979 3580607 ...it was the first day<br />after I knew about...
3581144 3582565 ...the pregnancy.
3584187 3588674 And I felt this fear for<br />the first time ever.
3591391 3595796 I remember thinking how can I bring<br />a child into a world like this?
3595887 3599873 How can...? How can a person grow up<br />with all this around them?
3607501 3609392 I told her I didn't want to have it.
3612079 3613872 And over the next few weeks...
3615290 3616787 ...I wore her down.
3619670 3621698 I wanna have children.
3626343 3628330 I can tell you now that....
3629221 3631995 I'm... I know, I mean....
3633558 3637168 I'm positive<br />that I made the right decision.
3637646 3640017 But there's not a day that passes...
3640108 3644107 ...that I don't wish<br />that I had made a different choice.
3647698 3649892 If you don't keep....
3651702 3654828 The baby, I mean,<br />if that's your decision...
3657040 3659410 ...don't ever tell him<br />that you were pregnant.
3661180 3664137 But if you choose to have this baby...
3665090 3668196 ...you spoil that kid<br />every chance you get.
3675267 3679675 That's about all the advice<br />I can give you, Tracy.
3687154 3688798 I got to go.
3688888 3690181 William.
3697331 3698775 Thank you.
3712346 3714564 Victor's landlord said<br />there was an envelope...
3714654 3716257 ...of cash in the office mailbox...
3716348 3717994 ...the first of every month.
3723106 3724602 Quote:
3724692 3728240 "I never heard a single complaint<br />from the tenant in Apartment 306."
3728330 3730957 "And nobody ever<br />complained about him."
3731048 3733765 "He's the best tenant I've<br />ever had," end quote.
3733855 3735885 Yeah, a landlord's dream.
3735975 3737716 A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.
3737807 3739753 Who pays the rent on time.
3740582 3743747 - I'm sick of all this waiting.<br />- This is the job.
3744920 3746330 Why aren't we out there?
3746420 3748748 Why do we gotta sit here rotting,...
3748838 3751689 ...waiting till the<br />lunatic does it again?
3751779 3754803 It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.<br />Don't make that mistake.
3754893 3757484 Come on, he's insane. Look.
3757574 3761823 Right now he's probably dancing around<br />in his grandma's panties.
3761913 3764889 Yeah, rubbing himself<br />in peanut butter.
3764980 3767845 - How's that?<br />- I don't think so.
3768824 3771017 His luck will run out.
3772155 3773950 Not depending on luck.
3777244 3779019 We walked into that<br />apartment exactly...
3779110 3781175 ...one year after he<br />tied Victor to the bed.
3781265 3783274 One year to the day.
3783364 3785696 - He wanted us to.<br />- Don't know that for sure.
3785787 3787063 Yes, we do.
3788338 3789712 This note he left.
3790424 3792059 His first words to us.
3792514 3794012 "Long is the way, and hard,...
3794102 3795950 ...that out of Hell<br />leads up to Light."
3798765 3800048 Fuck him. So what?
3800138 3802102 He's right, so far.
3802192 3806745 Imagine the will it takes<br />to keep a man bound for a full year.
3806835 3810774 To sever his hand<br />and use it to plant fingerprints.
3810865 3813234 To insert tubes into his genitals.
3814072 3819044 This guy is methodical, exacting,<br />and worst of all, patient.
3819134 3821042 He's a nut bag.
3821133 3824956 And just because the fucker's got<br />a library card doesn't make him Yoda.
3829754 3833167 - How much money you got?<br />- I got like 50. 50 bucks.
3833257 3835783 I propose a field trip. Come on.
3839556 3840640 We'll make a list.
3840730 3843615 At the top we'll put <i>Purgatory,<br />Canterbury Tales.</i>
3843705 3846421 Anything relating<br />to the seven deadly sins.
3846511 3848062 - Ask yourself...<br />- Hey, wait, wait.
3848152 3850899 ...what would he study<br />to do the things he's done?
3850989 3852808 What are his interests now?
3853612 3855484 Jack the Ripper, for instance.
3855885 3858147 - Where are we going?<br />- Library.
3871498 3873680 Coupons, coupons, free coupons.
3873771 3876175 Discount... Discount coupons.
3877344 3881734 They must've had about 50 health<br />violations during the last inspection.
3881825 3883048 Could you at least<br />sit across from me?
3883148 3885880 I don't want people<br />thinking we're dating.
3886603 3887978 Give me your money.
3889578 3891115 I'm giving you this, but<br />for some reason,...
3891205 3893464 ...I don't think I<br />know what we're doing.
3896446 3897640 Fuck.
3898949 3901097 - Hey, Somerset, how you doing?<br />- Okay.
3901187 3903371 Didn't figure this<br />was a m├⌐nage ├á trois.
3903462 3904693 It's not a problem.
3904784 3906117 Sit down.
3910794 3914492 Only for you do I do this,<br />so it's a big risk.
3914582 3917024 So I figure we're<br />just fair and square.
3917115 3919726 - It's a deal.<br />- All right.
3923348 3924645 About an hour.
3926810 3928405 Yeah, help yourself.
3931074 3932784 Well, that was money well spent.
3934317 3935490 Yeah.
3943326 3944680 All right.
3944770 3948062 By telling you this, I'm trusting<br />you more than I trust most people.
3948153 3950618 Well, good,<br />because I'm ready to punch you.
3952711 3956082 It's probably nothing, but even if<br />it is, it's no skin off our teeth.
3959676 3962754 The guy in the pizza parlor<br />is a friend from the Bureau.
3964514 3965806 Who, stinky man?
3966558 3968229 See, for years the FBI's...
3968319 3970445 ...been hooked into the library<br />system, keeping records.
3970535 3975093 - Assessing fines?<br />- No, monitoring reading habits.
3975183 3976655 - Look.<br />- What?
3976745 3978664 Certain books are flagged.
3978754 3983408 Books on, say, nuclear weapons<br />and, well, <i>Mein Kampf.</i>
3983498 3985472 Anyone who checks out<br />a flagged book...
3985573 3988609 ...has his library records fed<br />into the FBI's computers then on.
3988699 3990818 Wait, wait, how is this legal?
3990908 3993677 Legal, illegal.<br />These terms don't apply.
3993767 3995104 You...
3995194 3999401 You can't use the information<br />directly. It's just a useful guide.
3999491 4002338 It might sound silly,<br />but you can't get a library card...
4002429 4006086 ...without, an ID<br />and a current phone bill, see?
4008216 4010967 - So they run a list.<br />- Precisely.
4011057 4014516 If you wanna know who's reading<br /><i>Purgatory</i> and <i>Paradise Lost...</i>
4014606 4019706 ...and <i>Helter Skelter,</i><br />the FBI's computers will tell us.
4019796 4021782 - It could give us a name.<br />- It could.
4021882 4023665 Could get a name of some<br />college kid writing...
4023755 4026531 ...a term paper on<br />20th-century crime.
4026621 4028748 At least you're out of the office.
4028839 4030564 Get a haircut.
4031581 4033766 - How do you know all this?<br />- I don't.
4034209 4036574 - Neither do you.<br />- Exactly.
4044594 4049059 <i>"The Divine Comedy.<br />History of Catholicism."</i>
4049149 4051292 There's a book called<br /><i>Murderers and Madmen.</i>
4051383 4054831 <i>"Modern Homicide Investigation,<br />In Cold Blood."</i>
4055426 4057397 <i>"Of Human Bondage</i>." Bondage?
4057487 4059851 - Not what you think.<br />- Okay.
4059941 4062362 <i>"The Marquis de Sade."</i>
4062452 4064288 - It's the Marquis de Sade.<br />- Whatever.
4064379 4066760 <i>"The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqua..."</i><br />Something.
4066850 4069193 Saint Thomas Aquinas. There it is.
4069283 4071511 He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
4072247 4074524 - Is that it?<br />- Yeah.
4075534 4078178 - Let's try it.<br />- Jonathan Doe?
4078268 4079605 Whatever.
4080000 4081297 We're sure about that name?
4081388 4082514 Yeah.
4082604 4085208 You saw it, John Doe.
4085298 4087831 You wanna go back, I'll go back.
4087932 4090401 Let's take a look at him. Talk to him.
4090932 4092496 This is crazy.
4092587 4094431 We'll just talk to him.
4095603 4098598 "Excuse me, sir. Are you by<br />any chance a serial killer?"
4100400 4101457 Okay.
4102193 4103767 You do the talking.
4104818 4106358 Put that silver tongue<br />of yours to work.
4106449 4108829 No.<br />You been talking to my wife?
4112372 4114080 This is retarded.
4114789 4116615 <i>Charlie's Fucking Angels.</i>

4180396 4183065 Police. Is there a back way out?
4183155 4184532 Lock your door.

4446996 4448265 No.
4468935 4470158 Mills.
4472438 4475304 - Mills, you okay?<br />- I'm all right.
4478027 4479461 I'm all right.
4483658 4485458 - Where are you going?<br />- I'm going in.
4485549 4487968 No,  no. Wait,   wait.
4488329 4490091 - Wait.<br />- What are you talking about?
4490181 4491605 - He shot at us.<br />- You can't.
4491695 4493475 - The hell we can't.<br />- We need a warrant.
4493565 4495431 We got probable cause. Come on.
4495521 4496755 Think about it, think.
4496845 4498456 How did we get here?
4498546 4501909 - I can't tell anyone this.<br />- Come on, out of the way.
4501999 4503833 We have no reason to be here.
4503923 4505856 - Will you listen to me?<br />- Get off.
4505946 4507494 - Listen to me, listen.<br />- Get the fuck off me.
4507585 4509600 All right, all right, I'm sorry.
4509691 4511730 But would you<br />just pay attention a minute?
4512406 4515777 If we leave a hole like this,<br />we won't be able to prosecute.
4515867 4518612 The fucking guy will walk.<br />Now, is that what you want?
4518702 4521571 By the time we clear a warrant,<br />someone else... No, fuck that.
4521661 4525342 We need a reason to<br />knock on this door.
4526492 4527713 Think about it.
4529537 4530669 Okay?
4533207 4535286 Okay, man. Okay.
4535376 4537924 You're right. I'm all fucked up.
4538015 4539736 When you're right, you're right.
4547983 4551175 Well, no point in arguing anymore.
4553186 4554653 Unless you can fix that.
4556689 4559280 You stupid son of a....
4567742 4569516 How much money we got left?
4570494 4574226 So, yeah, like, I noticed<br />this guy going out a lot.
4574316 4578289 When the murders was<br />happening, so I... So...
4578379 4579809 So you called Detective<br />Somerset, right?
4579899 4581816 Yeah, right, so I called<br />the detective,...
4581906 4584185 ...because this guy<br />was creepy and shit.
4584275 4586986 And one of the murders, it<br />happened right over there.
4587077 4589755 - Okay. I told you the rest.<br />- Called the cops.
4589845 4590952 - Good?<br />- Got your story.
4591042 4592909 - Have her sign. You gotta sign.<br />- Okay.
4592999 4595296 Okay? Good, good.
4595386 4598223 - All right.<br />- You did good.
4598313 4600666 - I did what you said.<br />- Here you go.
4600756 4602896 You get something to eat, all right?<br />You eat.
4606405 4608370 Everybody, stay outside.
4669844 4671181 Victor.
4804353 4806076 Somerset!
4807815 4810615 - Somerset!<br />- Yeah?
4814738 4816808 - What?<br />- We had him.
4817575 4818946 What are you talking about?
4819410 4822246 The fucking photographer<br />in the fucking stairs.
4827387 4829270 We had him and we let him go.
4836218 4837831 You're sure this is him?
4837921 4839327 Yup, good, good. Yup.
4839417 4841085 - Yeah, good, get it out.<br />- All right.
4841176 4844523 We've got nothing, no pay stubs,<br />no appointment books, no addresses.
4844613 4846533 - This is the best, this receipt.<br />- Keep looking.
4846624 4848506 Let me show you something.<br />This was under the bed.
4848596 4850710 His only source of funds.
4850800 4853134 No kidding, we got his money.<br />Fucking A, I like it.
4853224 4854362 - One thing.<br />- Yes?
4854452 4856011 You're probably not<br />gonna believe this.
4856102 4857537 We haven't found a fingerprint yet.
4857628 4861666 - Not a single one.<br />- You're right, I don't. Keep looking.
4866499 4867998 We could use some more men here.
4868088 4871592 Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.<br />What are you getting with all this?
4871682 4873735 There are 2000 notebooks<br />on these shelves.
4873825 4876827 And each notebook contains<br />about 250 pages.
4876917 4879840 Forget it. Anything<br />about the killings?
4879930 4884263 "What sick ridiculous puppets we are,<br />and what a gross stage we dance on."
4884353 4888311 "What fun we have dancing and fucking.<br />Not a care in the world."
4888401 4890152 "Not knowing that we are nothing."
4890242 4892574 "We are not what was intended."
4892664 4894762 No, wait, there's a lot more.
4896111 4899929 "On the subway today, a man came up<br />to me to start a conversation."
4900019 4904148 "He made small talk, a lonely man,<br />talking about the weather and things."
4904239 4906514 "I tried to be pleasant<br />and accommodating."
4906604 4909437 "But my head began to hurt<br />from his banality."
4909527 4911332 "I almost didn't notice<br />it had happened,...
4911422 4913910 ...but I suddenly threw<br />up all over him."
4914808 4918979 "He was not pleased.<br />And I couldn't stop laughing."
4920427 4922005 No dates.
4922096 4924711 Placed on the shelves<br />in no discernible order.
4926350 4928760 Just his mind poured out on paper.
4929603 4931079 Looks like a life's work.
4931169 4934566 If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour<br />shifts, it'd still take two months.
4934656 4937104 I know, I know.
4940531 4941957 Where's that phone?
4945025 4946737 Phone?
4946827 4947956 Phone?
4950916 4952468 People, quiet.
4967850 4969971 - Hello?<br /><i>- I admire you.</i>
4971520 4974456 <i>I don't know how you found me,<br />but imagine my surprise.</i>
4975858 4979059 <i>I respect you law enforcement agents<br />more every day.</i>
4979149 4982239 Well, I appreciate that, John.
4982329 4984114 - I tell you...<br /><i>- No, listen, all right?</i>
4984204 4988367 <i>I'll be re-adjusting my schedule<br />in light of today's little setback.</i>
4988457 4990956 <i>I just had to call<br />and express my admiration.</i>
4991046 4994025 <i>Sorry I had to hurt one of you...</i>
4994115 4996791 <i>...but I didn't really<br />have a choice, did I?</i>
4996881 4998601 <i>You will accept my apology, won't you?</i>
4998692 5001100 <i>I feel like saying more,<br />but I don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i>
5006084 5009080 <i>...adjusting my<br />schedule after today's little setback.</i>
5009170 5010489 Got it.
5014897 5016438 All right, everybody, back to work.
5018734 5020219 You were right.
5020310 5023335 - He's preaching.<br />- Yeah.
5024531 5026838 These murders are his sermons to us.
5026929 5030005 Look, we know him,<br />we know him, we know him.
5033040 5034415 Who's the blonde?
5038796 5040399 Looks like a pro.
5040489 5042039 Maybe.
5042130 5044413 She caught John Doe's eye.
5049765 5052272 Yeah, he came and<br />collected it last night.
5052362 5053968 - Last night?<br />- Yeah.
5054058 5055674 - This man?<br />- Yeah, John Doe.
5055764 5058005 It's an easy name to remember.<br />He had a limp.
5058095 5061838 - What was this job you did for him?<br />- I've got a picture of it. Hang on.
5061928 5064159 One sweet piece, actually.
5064249 5065529 I thought he was one of them...
5065620 5067676 ...performance artists,<br />that's what I thought.
5067767 5073601 You know, the sort of guy that pisses<br />in a cup on stage and, then drinks it.
5073692 5075814 Performance art.
5079002 5081213 I think I undercharged him, actually.
5081303 5082608 You made this for him?
5082699 5085815 Yeah, I've made weirder shit<br />than that. So what?
5091390 5092801 They found the blonde.
5096061 5097552 The picture.
5097642 5099054 The picture.
5100482 5101959 Fucking pigs.
5104027 5106893 - We need you to move, pal.<br />- I'll come out, but you guys...
5106983 5108336 Get the fuck out of the booth.
5108427 5110319 I've been in this<br />cage the whole time.
5110409 5112686 - Okay?<br />- I'm not fucking with you.
5112776 5114548 Come on, this way.
5121336 5123199 Can you do something<br />about this music?
5123289 5126117 Yeah, we're working on it.<br />We're looking for the guy.
5138645 5140465 You from Homicide? You...
5140556 5142730 - You better see this.<br />- Yeah. All right.
5144234 5146737 Hey, easy. Got him?
5148864 5151447 Get this thing off of me.
5151537 5153936 God, get this thing off of me!
5154026 5155733 Get this thing off of me!
5155823 5157825 - Get this off!<br />- Get him out of here, now.
5157916 5159805 Get him out of here, now!
5160834 5163065 Come on, I wanna hear it again.
5163155 5166659 - Tell me again.<br />- Just... I don't know.
5166749 5170364 You heard nothing strange,<br />you saw nothing strange.
5170454 5172207 - No.<br />- No.
5173764 5175476 He asked me if I was married.
5175566 5177846 And I could see he<br />had a gun in his hand.
5177936 5179081 Where was the girl?
5179171 5181324 The what? What?
5181414 5183891 The girl, the prostitute.<br />Where was she?
5183981 5186425 Someone comes to your establishment.
5186515 5189393 They want to go downstairs<br />and wanna get a little...
5189483 5191056 Whatever.
5191146 5194840 - They got to come to you, yeah?<br />- Yeah.
5194930 5196603 You didn't see anyone?
5197162 5200588 With a package? A knapsack?<br />Something under their arm?
5200678 5205030 Hey, everybody that comes in there's<br />got a package under their arms.
5205120 5208445 Some guys are carrying suitcases<br />full of stuff.
5208535 5211577 She was just sitting on the bed.
5217710 5220510 Who tied her down? You or him?
5220600 5223043 Do you like what you do for a living?
5223133 5225625 - These things you see?<br />- No.
5227109 5228507 No, I don't.
5230289 5232129 But that's life, isn't it?
5236577 5242469 He had a gun and he made it happen.
5244126 5245900 He made me do it.
5245990 5249527 He put that thing on me.
5249617 5252277 And he made me wear it.
5252367 5256513 Then he told me to fuck her.
5257931 5260793 And I did. I fucked her.
5260883 5262455 God.
5262545 5265175 God, he had a gun in my mouth.
5265265 5268757 The fucking gun was in my throat.
5268847 5270030 <i>Fuck.</i>
5272988 5274649 <i> God.</i>
5274739 5277572 <i>God, help me. Please, help me.</i>
5277662 5279781 <i>Please, please, help me.</i>
5296803 5299600 You know,<br />this isn't gonna have a happy ending.
5299690 5301288 - It's not possible.<br />- Hey, if we catch him,...
5301378 5302865 ...I'll be happy enough.
5305354 5308445 If we catch John Doe and he<br />turns out to be the devil...
5308535 5312167 I mean, if he's Satan himself, that<br />might live up to our expectations...
5312257 5315027 ...but he's not the devil.
5316698 5318114 He's just a man.
5319076 5320755 You know...
5320845 5324007 ...see, you bitch and you complain<br />and you tell me these things. These:
5325499 5329974 If you think you're preparing me<br />for hard times, thank you, but....
5330065 5332264 But you gotta be a hero.
5333590 5336938 You wanna be a champion. Let me tell<br />you, people don't want a champion.
5337028 5339469 They wanna eat cheeseburgers,<br />play lotto and watch TV.
5339560 5341453 How did you get like this?
5342057 5343696 I wanna know.
5347896 5350140 It wasn't one thing,<br />I can tell you that.
5351942 5353234 Go on.
5356446 5358507 I just don't think I can<br />continue to live in a place...
5358597 5360973 ...that embraces and<br />nurtures apathy...
5361063 5363841 ...as if it was a virtue.
5363931 5365856 You're no different, no better.
5365946 5368387 I didn't say I was different<br />or better. I'm not.
5368477 5371670 Hell, I sympathize.<br />I sympathize completely.
5371760 5374137 Apathy is a solution.
5374227 5379371 I mean, it's easier to lose yourself<br />in drugs than it is to cope with life.
5379461 5381021 It's easier to steal what you want...
5381111 5382694 - ...than it is to earn it.<br />- Yeah.
5382784 5385342 It's easier to beat a child<br />than it is to raise it.
5385432 5388314 Hell, love costs. It<br />takes effort and work.
5388405 5390964 We are talking about people<br />who are mentally ill.
5391076 5393891 We are talking<br />about people, fucking crazies.
5393981 5395489 - No. No, we're not.<br />- Yes, today.
5395579 5399197 We're talking about<br />everyday life here.
5400027 5402664 You can't afford to be this naive.
5402754 5404438 Fuck off.
5404528 5408880 See, you should listen to yourself.<br />Yeah.
5408970 5412987 You say that the problem<br />with people is that they don't care.
5413628 5415610 So I don't care about people.
5415700 5417686 It makes no sense. You know why?
5417776 5419885 - You care?<br />- You wanna know...?
5419975 5422574 - Damn right.<br />- And you're gonna make a difference?
5422686 5426991 Whatever, the point is, is that I<br />don't think you're quitting...
5427081 5430364 ...because you believe these things<br />you say. I don't.
5430455 5433477 I think you wanna believe them<br />because you're quitting.
5435650 5439102 You want me to agree and say,<br />"Yeah, yeah, you're right."
5439192 5441321 "It's all fucked up.<br />It's a fucking mess."
5441412 5444351 "We should all go live<br />in a fucking log cabin."
5445410 5447239 But I won't.
5447329 5448957 I won't say that.
5450290 5453118 I don't agree with you. I do not.
5457339 5458655 I can't.
5468308 5469867 I'm gonna go home.
5477859 5479422 Thank you, though.
5509724 5511560 I love you, honey.
5512060 5513737 So much.
5515397 5516985 So much.
5521695 5523123 I know.
5585467 5587152 911, what's your emergency?
5588803 5589929 Could you repeat that?
5590020 5593168 <i>I've gone and done it again.</i>
5603526 5604952 What have we got?
5605042 5606627 Sleeping pills.
5608073 5609739 Glued to one hand.
5609829 5611674 Telephone glued to the other.
5613161 5614575 You see what he did?
5615455 5616969 He sliced her up.
5617457 5619023 Then he bandaged her.
5619501 5621581 Call for help and you'll live.
5621672 5623275 But you'll be disfigured.
5624850 5627898 Or you can put yourself<br />out of your own misery.
5628927 5630231 Come on.
5630321 5631585 Cut off her nose.
5631675 5633411 To spite her face.
5633502 5636073 And he did it very recently.
5643233 5644449 Listen.
5645360 5647615 I've decided to stay<br />on till this is done.
5648343 5650431 I figure one of two<br />things will happen.
5650521 5652117 We'll get John Doe...
5652207 5655237 ...or he'll finish his series of seven<br />and this case will go on for years.
5655328 5658540 Hey man, you don't have to do me<br />any favors. Thank you, but I got it.
5658631 5662009 I'm requesting that you keep me on<br />as your partner for a few more days.
5662099 5663736 You'd be doing me a favor.
5674806 5676402 You knew I'd say yes.
5676492 5678032 - Hey, we're here.<br />- Wonderful.
5678123 5681393 Your wife called.<br />Get yourself an answering machine.
5683773 5684939 Detective?
5686651 5689248 After this, I'm gone.
5689338 5692436 - No big surprise.<br />- Detective!
5694909 5696535 You're looking for me.
5697023 5698175 Hey!
5699065 5701653 Don't you fucking move.<br />On the fucking floor.
5701743 5703036 Keep away from him!
5703127 5704952 - On the fucking floor.<br />- I know you.
5705043 5707129 Now. Get down.
5707219 5709930 Get down on your stomach,<br />you piece of shit.
5710021 5712004 Now. All the way!
5712094 5714234 All the way, fucker! Down!
5714324 5717039 Faster. Faster, fucker.
5717130 5720018 Now. Nose on the ground.
5723229 5726023 Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?
5726113 5729581 I'd like to speak to<br />my lawyer, please.
5731112 5732903 Goddamn it.
5734783 5737008 He cuts the skin off the tips<br />of his fingers.
5737098 5741438 That's why we couldn't find one single<br />usable print in his apartment.
5741528 5743981 Looks like he's been doing it<br />for a quite sometime.
5744071 5746488 What about the bank accounts?<br />The guns?
5746578 5748490 So far everything's a dead end.
5748580 5751433 No credit history. No<br />employment records.
5751523 5755275 His bank account's only 5 years<br />old and it was started with cash.
5755365 5757340 We're even trying to<br />trace his furniture.
5757441 5759937 About only thing we know<br />about that guy right now...
5760027 5764995 ...is that he's independently wealthy,<br />well-educated and totally insane.
5765085 5767129 Because he's John Doe by choice.
5767219 5768958 Okay, so when do we<br />get to question him?
5769048 5770097 You don't.
5770187 5771957 - He going to court now.<br />- What?
5772047 5774508 I'm telling you,<br />there's no way he'd turn himself in.
5774599 5776367 It doesn't make any sense.
5776468 5780034 Well, there he sits.<br />It's not supposed to make any sense.
5780135 5782946 - He's not finished.<br />- No, he's pissing in our faces.
5783036 5786777 We're just taking it like idiots.<br />You know what I'm talking about.
5787419 5790712 For the first time ever,<br />you and I are in total agreement.
5791589 5794766 - He wouldn't just stop.<br />- So, what the fuck, man?
5795176 5798623 He's two murders away<br />from completing his masterpiece.
5799806 5801536 We'll wait for his plea.
5805019 5809639 My client says there are two more<br />bodies. Two more victims hidden away.
5809740 5812622 He will take Detectives Mills<br />and Somerset to these bodies...
5812712 5816994 ...but only Detective Mills and<br />Somerset, only at 6:00 today.
5817084 5818422 Why us?
5818825 5820388 He says he admires you.
5822036 5823456 It's part of the game.
5823557 5826372 The client claims if the<br />detectives do not accept this...
5826462 5827975 ...these bodies<br />will never be found.
5828065 5830276 Frankly, I'm inclined<br />to let them rot.
5830366 5831815 Hey.
5831905 5833255 We've got him.
5833345 5835643 Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.
5835745 5838849 He's gonna get his free room and<br />board, get his free cable TV.
5838939 5842343 Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.<br />Why are we having this conversation?
5842433 5845085 - Mills.<br />- No. Hey, something stinks.
5845175 5846464 And this one here...
5846554 5850237 Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit<br />and that smug smile on your face...
5850327 5851829 ...dealing for that<br />shit, I don't like it...
5851919 5853099 Mills.
5853189 5855374 I am required by law<br />to serve my clients...
5855464 5857327 - ...to the best of my ability.<br />- Jesus.
5857417 5860700 - To serve their best interest.<br />- We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.
5860790 5863558 My client wishes inform you<br />if you do not accept...
5863648 5866414 ...he will plead insanity<br />across the board.
5866504 5868210 Let him try it.
5868300 5869539 I'd like to see him try.
5869629 5872722 Come on, now, we all know<br />the extreme nature of these crimes...
5872812 5875286 ...I could get him off<br />with such a plea.
5875376 5878059 I'm not letting this conviction slide.<br />I can tell you that.
5878149 5881938 He says that if you do accept<br />under his specific conditions...
5882028 5884952 ...he'll sign a full confession,<br />plead guilty right now.
5885042 5887566 It's your case. Make a decision.
5889062 5890811 Full confession.
5890912 5893692 - I'm in.<br />- It has to be the both of you.
5895109 5900632 If he were to claim insanity,<br />this conversation is admissible.
5900722 5902832 The fact that he's blackmailing us<br />with his plea.
5902922 5905878 And my client would like to remind you<br />two more are dead.
5905968 5907196 Press would have a field day...
5907286 5910577 ...if they find out the police<br />didn't seem concerned about them.
5910667 5913958 - Giving them a proper burial.<br />- If in fact there are two more dead.
5914048 5915911 Lab report came up from downtown.
5916001 5918492 They did a quickie on<br />Doe's clothing and nails.
5918583 5922027 They found blood from Doe.<br />From him slicing his fingers.
5922117 5924851 Blood from the woman<br />who's face he cut off.
5924942 5929132 And blood from a third party,<br />as yet unidentified.
5932855 5935220 You'd be escorting an unarmed man.
5937986 5939489 Let's finish it.
5943074 5946258 If John Doe's head splits open<br />and a UFO should fly out...
5946349 5948952 ...I want you to have expected it.
5950665 5951963 I will.
5954638 5957275 Hey, man, if I was<br />to accidentally shave off a nipple...
5957366 5959362 ...would it be covered<br />by workman's comp?
5963986 5965609 I suppose so.
5966848 5967956 - Yeah.<br />- If you were man enough...
5968047 5972450 ...to actually file a claim,<br />I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.
5973688 5976924 If I keep coming home late,<br />my wife's gonna think something's up.
5986034 5987103 You know....
5988703 5989842 Yeah.
5995835 5997024 What?
6068741 6070061 Let's go.
6100398 6102909 <i>C-Victor-5-5 take. Clear the TC.</i>
6103000 6104394 Pull around.
6105653 6108437 <i>There it is. Late-model black<br />sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>
6117999 6119390 Who are you, John?
6120251 6121570 Who are you really?
6122336 6123507 What do you mean?
6123597 6127753 At this stage, what harm can it do<br />to tell us a bit about yourself?
6127843 6131013 It doesn't matter who I am.<br />Who I am means absolutely nothing.
6131104 6133289 You need to stay on your left up here.
6137351 6138634 So where are we heading?
6139729 6141089 You'll see.
6141522 6144499 We're not just going to pick up<br />two more dead bodies, are we, John?
6145526 6147093 That wouldn't be shocking enough.
6147570 6150128 We've got newspapers<br />to think about, yeah?
6151783 6153754 Wanting people to listen...
6154160 6157763 ...you can't just tap them<br />on the shoulder anymore.
6157853 6160298 You have to hit them<br />with a sledgehammer.
6160388 6163478 And then you'll notice<br />you've got their strict attention.
6163568 6165521 But the question is:
6165611 6168632 What makes you so special<br />that people should listen?
6168722 6170175 I'm not special.
6171052 6173039 <i>I've never been exceptional.</i>
6173888 6177809 <i>This is, though, what I'm doing.<br />My work.</i>
6177899 6179482 Your work, John?
6179894 6181068 Yes.
6181158 6184806 See, I don't see anything<br />special about it, John.
6185566 6186670 That's not true.
6186760 6187898 No, it is true.
6187988 6190770 And the funny thing<br />is, all this work...
6191364 6193173 ...two months from now,<br />no one's gonna care.
6193263 6195766 No one's gonna give a shit,<br />no one's gonna remember.
6195856 6198799 You can't see the whole complete<br />act yet.
6199831 6201652 But when this is done...
6202750 6204279 ...when it's finished...
6205920 6207704 ...it's going to be....
6210424 6213835 People will barely be able<br />to comprehend.
6213926 6215851 But they won't be able to deny.
6217598 6219378 Could the freak be more vague?
6220226 6222489 I mean, as far as master<br />plans go, John...
6222579 6223730 I can't wait for you to see.
6223820 6226567 I really can't. It's really<br />going to be something.
6227606 6230431 Well, you know what?<br />I'm gonna be standing next to you.
6230521 6233936 So when this big thing happens,<br />you be sure and let me know.
6234026 6237418 - Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.<br />- Don't worry.
6237508 6238850 You won't.
6240598 6242304 You won't miss a thing.
6249315 6252614 <i>With the tour bus itself,<br />give two miles separation.</i>
6269376 6270860 What's so exciting?
6271908 6273546 It's not too far now.
6277551 6279303 <i>High-tension lines ahead.</i>
6279394 6281207 <i>Prepare for frequency change.</i>
6281297 6283381 I've been trying to figure something<br />in my head.
6283471 6285632 And maybe you can help me out, yeah?
6287407 6291731 When a person is insane,<br />as you clearly are...
6291822 6293858 ...do you know that you're insane?
6294360 6296613 Maybe you're sitting around,<br />reading <i>Guns and Ammo...</i>
6296704 6300242 ...masturbating in your own feces,<br />do you just stop and go:
6300333 6304060 "It is amazing how fucking crazy<br />I really am"?
6304151 6306282 Yeah? Do you guys do that?
6307373 6310051 It's more comfortable<br />for you to label me insane.
6310141 6311692 It's very comfortable.
6312211 6315019 It's not something I would expect<br />you to accept.
6315923 6318511 But I did not choose. I was chosen.
6318601 6319923 Well, whatever.
6320014 6322247 I don't doubt that you<br />believe that, John.
6323305 6326763 But seems to me that you're<br />overlooking a glaring contradiction.
6327559 6328917 Meaning what?
6330020 6331395 Glad you asked.
6333273 6334934 If you were chosen...
6335025 6338367 ...that is, by a higher power...
6339655 6341419 ...and if your hand was forced...
6342074 6345232 ...it seems strange to me that you'd<br />get such enjoyment out of it.
6345828 6348124 You enjoyed torturing those people.
6349415 6352391 This doesn't seem in keeping<br />with martyrdom, does it?
6354086 6355250 John?
6360134 6363098 I doubt I enjoyed it<br />any more than Detective Mills...
6363189 6366418 ...would enjoy time alone with me<br />in a room without windows.
6367474 6368906 Isn't that true?
6369601 6372632 How happy would it make you<br />to hurt me with impunity.
6372722 6374190 That hurts my feelings.
6375357 6376518 - I would never...<br />- You wouldn't...
6376608 6378534 ...because there's consequences.
6380029 6382257 It's in those eyes of yours, though.
6382747 6385789 Nothing wrong with a man<br />taking pleasure in his work.
6386243 6391416 I won't deny my own personal desire<br />to turn each sin against the sinner.
6392166 6395654 Wait a minute, I thought all you<br />did was kill innocent people.
6397421 6400299 Innocent? Is that<br />supposed to be funny?
6400883 6402401 An obese man.
6402491 6405026 A disgusting man<br />who could barely stand up.
6405116 6407684 If you saw him, you'd point<br />him out to your friends...
6407775 6409588 ...so they'd join you in mocking him.
6409678 6411861 A man, who if you saw him<br />while you were eating...
6411951 6414132 ...you wouldn't be able<br />to finish your meal.
6414938 6416232 And after him, lawyer.
6416322 6418919 You must've secretly been<br />thanking me for that one.
6419009 6421923 This is a man who<br />dedicated his life...
6422013 6426820 ...to making money by lying with<br />every breath that he could muster...
6426910 6429839 ...to keeping murderers and rapists<br />on the streets.
6429929 6431396 - Murderers?<br />- A woman.
6431486 6433640 - Murderers, John, like yourself?<br />- A woman...
6433730 6436513 ...so ugly inside that she<br />couldn't bear to go on living...
6436603 6438930 ...if she couldn't be beautiful<br />on the outside?
6439020 6443201 A drug dealer.<br />A drug dealing pederast, actually.
6443675 6446741 And let's not forget<br />the disease-spreading whore.
6448597 6450634 Only in a world this shitty...
6451183 6453513 ...could you try to say<br />these were innocent people...
6453604 6455343 ...and keep a straight face.
6458107 6459464 But that's the point.
6461151 6464219 We see a deadly sin<br />on every street corner...
6464310 6467815 ...in every home and we tolerate it.
6467905 6470701 We tolerate it<br />because it's common, it's....
6470791 6472065 It's trivial.
6472663 6475176 We tolerate it morning,<br />noon and night.
6478710 6480308 Well, not anymore.
6482881 6484686 I'm setting the example.
6486260 6488004 And what I've done is gonna be...
6488094 6489297 ...puzzled over...
6490055 6491366 ...and studied...
6492683 6493937 ...and followed...
6495894 6497098 ...forever.
6497729 6499059 Yeah.
6500399 6502194 Delusions of grandeur.
6503610 6505183 You should be thanking me.
6505904 6507390 Why's that, John?
6507480 6510405 Because you're going<br />to be remembered after this.
6510495 6514470 Realize, detective, the only reason<br />that I'm here right now...
6514560 6516561 ...is that I wanted to be.
6516651 6519238 No. No, we would've<br />got you eventually.
6519328 6520805 Really?
6520895 6525603 So, what were you doing, biding<br />your time? Toying with me?
6525693 6529108 Allowing five innocent<br />people to die...
6529198 6531329 ...until you felt like<br />springing your trap?
6531419 6533745 Tell me, what was the<br />indisputable evidence...
6533835 6535520 ...you were going to use on me...
6535610 6540081 ...right before I walked up to you<br />and put my hands in the air?
6540171 6542469 John, calm down.
6542559 6545181 I seem to remember us<br />knocking on your door.
6545271 6547136 That's right.
6547227 6550804 And I seem to remember<br />breaking your face.
6555412 6558204 You're only alive because<br />I didn't kill you.
6558294 6560426 - Okay, sit back.<br />- I spared you.
6560516 6561649 Sit back.
6561739 6564139 Remember that every time<br />you look in the mirror...
6564229 6566891 ...at that face of yours<br />for the rest of your life...
6566981 6568811 ...or should I say for the rest...
6568901 6571227 - ...of what life I allow you to have.<br />- Sit back.
6571318 6575221 Sit back, you fucking freak.<br />Shut your fucking mouth.
6576683 6579454 You're no messiah.<br />You're a movie of the week.
6579545 6582783 You're a fucking T-shirt at best.
6596286 6598535 Don't ask me to pity those people.
6598625 6599686 I don't mourn them any more...
6599777 6603067 ...than the thousands that died<br />at Sodom and Gomorrah.
6603158 6607866 Is that to say, John, that what you<br />were doing was God's good work?
6610884 6613673 The Lord works in mysterious ways.
6616098 6618625 Do you see those high-tension towers?
6618715 6620253 <i>- That's where we're headed.</i><br /><i>- I see where.</i>
6620344 6623348 <i>Right to your 9 o'clock<br />and follow that access road.</i>
6629861 6631502 <i>Your signal's breaking up, Viking.</i>
6631593 6635454 <i>Un-fucking-avoidable, Center. We're<br />in power-line city, deal with it.</i>
6637160 6640056 This sure as shit is<br />no ambush out here.
6640146 6642914 - No fucking nothing out here.<br />- Can't land anywhere near.
6643004 6645918 They're gonna be coming up<br />behind us in about two minutes.
6646008 6648349 I want you to go up, way up.
6648439 6651806 Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark.<br />Thirty seconds.
6713695 6714953 I'm getting him out.
6717532 6719640 <i>Target is now fully into standby.</i>
6720452 6721553 <i>Got you in sight.</i>
6721643 6722710 <i>Get out.</i>
6723580 6724911 Slowly.
6725707 6726865 Stop.
6727751 6728937 Stay.
6732047 6733308 What do you got?
6734883 6736132 Dead dog.
6737928 6739294 I didn't do that.
6743141 6745462 <i>We're holding on standby, copy?</i>
6746311 6747718 What time is it?
6748313 6750682 - Why?<br />- I'd like to know.
6754277 6755696 Seven-o-one.
6758657 6760006 It's close.
6760826 6762279 Let's go take a look.
6765747 6767091 It's this way.
6769835 6771973 <i>Bird 2, close your distance.</i>
6772063 6774607 <i>This is Bird 2. They're<br />away from the car.</i>
6774698 6776424 <i>Coming in closer.</i>
6778802 6782150 <i> We got them. Closing in.</i>
6782240 6784310 <i> Negative. Hold your go.</i>
6809576 6810755 Mills?
6815182 6817936 Down, down.
6819161 6820354 Watch him.
6821925 6823482 There he goes.
6824021 6826463 <i>It's good we have some time to talk.</i>
6830277 6831809 <i>Van approaching.</i>
6831899 6835761 Stay on the guy in red. Do not take<br />the crosshairs off the guy in red.
6839912 6842879 <i>He's going out<br />to meet the van. Just stay down.</i>
6842970 6845871 There's a van coming down the road.<br />From the north.
6855435 6858045 Be ready for anything, now.<br />Wait for my signal.
6858136 6859760 Wait for me.
6865236 6867103 Get out of the van!
6868774 6869817 <i>Out!</i>
6869908 6872133 Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.
6872224 6873656 Step away.
6874370 6876581 Turn around.<br />Put your hands on your head.
6876672 6878963 What the hell is going on?
6879053 6881722 <i>- What are you doing here?</i><br />- I'm delivering a package.
6881812 6884006 I got this package<br />for this guy, David.
6884420 6886700 Detective David Mills.
6894182 6896117 Get it. Slowly.
6897393 6899938 <i>Stay alert. He's opening<br />the back of the van.</i>
6900029 6901840 <i>We've got him in sight.</i>
6908029 6911408 This guy paid me 500 bucks<br />to bring it out here, man.
6911498 6913783 He said he wanted it<br />here at exactly 7:00.
6914197 6915399 Put it down.
6916412 6917820 <i>We got a box.</i>
6917910 6922555 We got a box. Call the bomb squad.<br />I need a bomb squad. We got a box.
6922645 6923969 Face the van.
6924754 6926175 Hands up.
6933638 6934791 Turn around.
6936140 6938618 Okay. Go. Off you go. Go.
6938708 6940777 <i>Do you want us to pick this guy up?</i>
6941271 6943572 I'm sending the driver out on foot.
6946004 6947121 <i>Got the driver in sight.</i>
6947223 6949632 He's headed north.<br />Have him picked up.
6959372 6960939 I don't know.
6967505 6969097 I'm gonna open it.
6969188 6972653 When I said I admired you,<br />I meant what I said.
6991772 6992856 It's blood.
6992947 6995129 You've made quite a<br />life for yourself.
6995762 6999290 - You should be very proud.<br />- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
7012806 7015001 <i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i>
7026898 7028358 California, stay away from here.
7028449 7030823 Stay away from here, now.<br />Don't come in here.
7031444 7033279 <i>Whatever you hear, stay away.</i>
7034364 7037554 John Doe has the upper hand. Mills!
7037644 7038866 Here he comes.
7038956 7041080 - Throw your gun down!<br />- What?
7041170 7043461 - I wish I could've lived like you.<br />- Shut up.
7043552 7046379 - What the fuck you talking about?<br />- Go away!
7046469 7048093 Do you hear me, detective?
7048184 7052652 I'm trying to tell you how much<br />I admire you and your pretty wife.
7053424 7055314 - What?<br />- Tracy.
7055404 7056622 Mills!
7056712 7057970 What'd you fucking say?
7058060 7062179 It's disturbing how easily a member of<br />the press can purchase information...
7062269 7064386 ...from the men in your precinct.
7064476 7066251 What the fuck?
7066341 7068372 <i>Throw your gun down!</i>
7068463 7070697 I visited your home this morning....
7071526 7073394 After you'd left.
7073484 7075836 - Mills!<br />- I tried to play husband.
7076280 7079655 I tried to taste the<br />life of a simple man.
7079745 7081095 Throw it away!
7081185 7082969 It didn't work out.
7083621 7084855 So....
7085456 7087130 I took a souvenir.
7089001 7090807 Her pretty head.
7090897 7092133 Mills.
7093005 7094237 Mills.
7095633 7096876 What's he talking about?
7096966 7099240 - Give me your gun.<br />- What's going on over there?
7099330 7100786 Put the gun down.
7100876 7103090 I saw you with a box.<br />What was in the box?
7103180 7105983 - Because I envy your normal life.<br />- Put the gun down, David.
7106073 7109409 - It seems that envy is my sin.<br />- What's in the box?
7109499 7111582 - Not until you give me the gun.<br />- What's in the box?
7111673 7113575 - Give me the gun.<br />- He just told you.
7113665 7116385 You lie. You're a fucking liar,...
7116475 7117610 - ...shut up.<br />- David.
7117700 7120312 That's what he wants.<br />He wants you to shoot him.
7120402 7123156 No! No.
7123995 7125788 You tell me that's not true.
7125879 7128179 - That's not true.<br />- Become vengeance, David.
7128270 7130708 - She's all right. You tell me.<br />- Become...
7131294 7133901 - ...wrath.<br />- Tell me she's all right!
7133991 7136631 - If you murder a suspect, David...<br />- No.
7136721 7139252 - You throw it all away, he knows it.<br />- No!
7139343 7141675 - She begged for her life.<br />- Shut up.
7141766 7146508 She begged for her life and for the<br />life of the baby inside of her.
7164535 7166052 He didn't know.
7179717 7181314 Give me the gun, David.
7186641 7187840 David.
7189435 7191070 If you kill him...
7192355 7193836 ...he will win.
7197819 7199620 God.
7199711 7201511 God.
7217226 7219352 Fuck, he shot him.
7241195 7243244 <i>Set it down somewhere.</i>
7244991 7246793 <i>Come on, set us down.</i>
7249704 7253053 <i>Holy Christ. Somebody call somebody.</i>
7253666 7255328 <i>Call somebody.</i>
7269974 7272460 Well, we'll take care of him.
7281694 7283340 Whatever he needs.
7284655 7286354 Where are you gonna be?
7288868 7290238 Around.
7294582 7295997 I'll be around.
