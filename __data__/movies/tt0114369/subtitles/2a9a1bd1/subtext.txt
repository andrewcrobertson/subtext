74480 77472 They were screaming at each other<br />for 2 hours. Nothing new.
77720 80792 Then they heard the gun go off.<br />Both barrels.
82160 83513 A crime of passion.
84480 84992 Yeah.
85920 88434 Just look at all the passion<br />on that wall.
88720 91234 This is a done deal.<br />All but the paperwork.
95440 96793 Did the kid see it?
97040 97597 What?
98680 99317 The kid.
100440 101873 What kind of question's that?
103200 106715 We'll be glad to<br />get rid of you, Somerset.
107480 108754 Always these questions.
109000 111958 "Did the kid see it?"<br />Who gives a fuck?
112200 112950 He's dead.
113200 115316 His wife killed him.<br />The rest is nothing to do with us.
124640 125595 Detective Somerset?
127160 128434 I'm Detective Mills.
131080 134072 I get in town 20 minutes ago,<br />they dump me here.
134280 135030 Look...
135960 136597 Mills?
137120 139680 Let's find a bar,<br />sit and talk...
139920 141751 I'd like to get to the precinct.
142000 144434 Not much time for<br />this transition thing.
145920 148639 I had a question,<br />when we spoke on the phone.
148840 149317 Yeah?
151200 153760 - Why here?<br />- I don't follow.
154680 157148 All this effort<br />to get transferred.
158440 160874 It's the first question<br />that popped into my head.
161440 162793 Same reasons as you,
163080 165913 or the reasons you had<br />before you decided to quit.
168360 169793 You just met me.
171040 173110 Maybe I don't understand<br />the question.
174480 175549 It's very simple.
176600 179990 You actually fought<br />to get reassigned here.
180960 184430 - I never saw it done that way.<br />- Thought I'd do some good.
184680 188639 Be great if we didn't start out<br />kicking each other in the balls.
190600 192750 - You're calling the shots.<br />- Yes.
194240 197198 I want you to look<br />and listen, okay?
197480 201314 I wasn't guarding a Taco Bell.<br />I worked homicide 5 years.
201560 203278 - Not here.<br />- I understand.
203520 207274 Over the next 7 days,<br />do me a favor and remember that.
423600 425238 Yeah. Okay.
427120 428109 Say it again?
431080 434914 I thought we moved here<br />to get away from tractor pulls.
439840 441398 Serpico's got to go.
442080 444674 You might want to get rid of...
445000 447150 this crusty. This eye, Serpico.
447560 448879 - Did you get it?<br />- Got it.
449160 449751 Good.
466360 467475 Coffee? No?
471760 474638 Nothing's been touched.<br />It's all like I found it.
474960 476393 What time was death established?
476640 477914 Like I said,
478200 479553 I didn't touch anything,
480240 483789 but he's had his face<br />in spaghetti for 45 minutes.
484040 485871 No one bothers with vital signs?
486520 487475 Did I stutter?
487720 490951 He ain't breathing unless<br />he's breathing spaghetti sauce.
491240 494118 - That's how it's done around here?<br />- I beg your pardon, Detective,
494360 497113 but the guy's sitting in a pile<br />of his own piss and shit.
497360 499237 If he wasn't dead,<br />he would have stood up by now.
499520 501158 - Alright.<br />- Thank you, officer.
502120 502757 Thank you.
512800 513550 I wonder...
516240 520074 what was the point<br />of that conversation?
520400 521071 I don't know.
521400 524995 How many times Barney Five found<br />dead bodies that weren't dead?
526800 527516 Drop it.
557800 560951 Phone Guinness.<br />I think we got a record here.
576480 578391 Better Homes and Gardens.
588760 590398 Who said this was murder?
590960 591517 No one.
594040 595393 Guy's heart must be
595640 596959 the size of a canned ham.
600080 601832 If this isn't a coronary,
602280 602837 well,
603920 604750 I don't know.
621360 622031 Whoops.
629720 630994 How about that?
641200 642918 We had this case once,
643920 645751 guy dead on the ground,
646000 647592 knife in his back.
647840 648829 Murder, right?
651120 651791 Fuck.
652720 655518 Big insurance policy involved.
655800 657552 Guy took the tip of the blade,
657840 659910 stuck it in<br />his own shoulder blades.
660160 662833 He must have screwed up<br />because there were...
663120 664872 ...multiples back there.<br />- Please be quiet.
674760 675556 Wait a minute.
675920 676477 What?
679680 680999 We got a bucket here.
682320 683196 What's in it?
688840 689431 My God!
690000 691399 Fucking vomit!
693960 694915 Any blood in it?
695600 697955 I didn't see any.<br />Help yourself.
703080 704911 Are you thinking it's poison?
706000 707877 Oh, wonderful. Very moody.
708640 710039 Think it's poison, Somerset?
710360 713158 You girls have got<br />forensics waiting outside.
713520 714748 We might not fit.
715000 717389 There's room.<br />Light's the problem.
717680 718396 How are you?
719560 721551 Detective Mills,<br />go help the officers
721800 723233 question the neighbors.
726040 726552 What?
726920 728672 And send in forensics.
743760 744715 He's dead.
746600 747715 Thank you, doctor.
753800 756075 You saw my files,<br />the things I've done?
757520 757952 Nope.
761040 764112 I did door-to-doors,<br />walked the beat, all that shit...
764400 765628 a long time.
766640 768073 - And?<br />- My badge says...
768320 771039 "detective", same as yours.
772440 774192 Look, I made a decision.
774960 777520 I had to consider<br />the integrity of the crime scene,
777760 780877 not whether you were getting<br />enough time in the field.
781280 781871 Hey, man...
783920 787390 Just don't jerk me off.<br />That's all I ask.
793680 794669 He's been dead...
794920 797559 a long time,<br />and not from poison.
797800 798437 Oh, man.
798960 801030 How can you<br />let yourself go like this?
801560 804358 It took four orderlies<br />just to get him on the table.
807120 809793 How'd the fat fuck<br />fit out his door?
810000 811672 It's obvious he was a shut-in.
812080 814230 See how big this stomach is?
814520 817432 Strange thing is, it stretches.
817960 821077 Look, the size of the<br />cardiac orifice, where the food...
821320 823754 I see that,<br />but it means nothing to me.
824000 825956 He's got lines of distention
826200 827599 across the duodenum.
827840 829319 The interior wall's ripped open.
830960 832871 This man ate till he burst?
833360 835828 No, he didn't burst all the way.
836080 838036 He was hemorrhaging internally.
838280 840748 There was a hematoma<br />in the rectus and...
841000 843833 ...the abdominal muscles.<br />- He did die by eating?
844080 844876 Yes and no.
847440 848998 What about these bruises here?
850840 852558 I haven't figured that out yet.
852840 854512 Gun pressed against his head?
854800 855994 Pressed hard enough.
856200 857030 Fuck, yeah.
857680 860240 On the front,<br />flush with the muzzle.
862160 865118 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have a homicide.
868480 872234 Killer put a bucket under him.<br />Took his time, too.
872680 875319 Coroner said<br />it could've lasted 12 hours.
875600 878637 Victim's throat was swollen,<br />probably from the effort,
878880 881519 and there was a point<br />when he passed out.
881760 883671 That's when the killer kicked him,
883920 885638 ...and he burst.<br />- Sadistic fucker.
885880 888633 When you want somebody dead,<br />you drive by and shoot.
888880 891235 You don't risk<br />the time it takes for this,
891480 894631 unless the act itself<br />has meaning.
895080 898959 Somebody had a problem with<br />a fat boy and tortured him. Simple.
899240 900355 In the grocer bags,
900560 904030 we found two receipts.<br />So the killer went back...
904280 905508 to the supermarket.
906280 906837 So?
908800 911837 It's his thing.<br />I've been out in the rain.
912080 913832 - This is a beginning.<br />- We've got...
914080 915672 one dead guy, not three.
916000 916830 No motive.
918120 920350 Don't start<br />that big brain of yours...
920600 922113 cooking on this, alright?
922640 924437 I'd like to be reassigned.
925080 925637 Whoa!
926680 928671 What are you talking about?
929040 931235 This can't be my last duty.
931480 932549 It'll go on and on.
932960 935190 You're retiring in 6 days.
935440 938273 You've left<br />unfinished business before.
938560 942348 The cases were taken<br />as close as possible to conclusion.
943080 945310 - May I speak freely?<br />- We're friends here.
945560 946959 It shouldn't be his first case.
947240 950994 I knew it. It's not<br />my first assignment, you dick.
951240 952229 It's too soon for him.
952480 955472 You can say that shit<br />to my face. Captain?
955720 956789 It's too soon for you.
957920 958511 Captain,
958920 960797 can we talk in private?
961040 962268 This is a personal thing...
962840 963909 Just shut up, Mills.
964240 965798 I don't have anyone else
966040 969077 to put on this.<br />This is Metro.
969320 972073 - You don't just get to swap.<br />- Give it to me.
972480 973117 What?
973360 976636 He wants out, fuck him.<br />See you, have a nice time.
976880 977676 Give it to me.
977920 979672 I'll put you on something else.
982280 984191 Go on, Mills, just go on.
990160 993118 I'm sorry, old buddy,<br />but it looks like you're stuck
993360 994873 cleaning up the fat man.
1012640 1013595 Quiet down.
1014840 1017115 Alright, calm down, calm down.
1017680 1018556 Quiet down.
1022720 1023948 Here's how it'll work:
1024560 1028075 I'll answer questions<br />for 10 minutes only.
1028720 1032679 Ask those questions in a calm,<br />orderly fashion, or I will leave.
1033280 1034793 Detective?
1035200 1036792 - Can I have a moment?<br />- No.
1042000 1044434 I won't discuss the details<br />of this investigation,
1044680 1046511 so don't bother asking.
1064960 1067428 - What you got for me?<br />- Nothing yet, boss.
1071280 1074113 Why don't you guys<br />go get a coffee?
1075760 1079469 We have this breaking story.<br />Let's go downtown, where attorney,
1079760 1082149 Eli Gould,<br />was found murdered today.
1082440 1086399 DA Martin Talbot is taking<br />questions from reporters.
1090640 1092631 That's ridiculous and offensive.
1092960 1094837 There is no conflict,
1095080 1097674 and any claim there could be<br />is irresponsible.
1098880 1099551 Now hold on.
1101520 1104910 I just met with<br />law enforcement officials,
1105240 1109233 and they have<br />their very best men on this.
1109920 1112275 This will be the definition
1113560 1114834 of swift justice.
1137720 1138869 Pardon me, George.
1143640 1145471 - Somerset...<br />- Come in.
1147040 1148234 You heard the news?
1148480 1149754 Nope, haven't heard.
1150000 1152514 Eli Gould was found murdered<br />this morning.
1152760 1156196 Someone broke into his law firm<br />and bled him to death.
1156840 1159070 Wrote the word "greed"<br />on the floor.
1164520 1166750 - Greed?<br />- Yeah, in blood.
1167560 1169437 Mills is heading the investigation.
1170600 1171794 Excuse me.
1173120 1174235 Don't do that, please?
1177400 1178628 Good for him.
1179280 1180395 What will you do...
1180640 1182551 with yourself out there, Somerset?
1182800 1185712 I'll work maybe on a farm.<br />Fix my house.
1185960 1187188 Don't you feel it?
1187800 1189518 Don't you feel that feeling?
1190080 1192355 You won't be a cop anymore.
1192800 1194233 That's the whole idea.
1196200 1197474 I don't think you'll leave.
1198200 1200191 You can't leave all this.
1202680 1204432 Guy's out walking his dog.
1204720 1205675 Gets attacked.
1206520 1208670 His watch is taken, his wallet.
1209040 1210268 And while he's lying on<br />the sidewalk,
1210520 1212033 helpless,
1212760 1215320 his attacker stabs him<br />in both eyes.
1216920 1219559 This happened last night,<br />four blocks from here.
1220560 1221390 I read about it.
1222520 1224078 I don't understand anymore.
1224760 1226113 It's the way it's always been.
1226480 1229916 - Maybe you're right.<br />- You were made for this work.
1230240 1232117 You can't deny that.
1233360 1234509 Maybe I'm wrong.
1236960 1238996 Coroner sent this for you.
1239920 1242275 Found them in<br />the fat boy's stomach,
1242640 1245632 mixed in with the food.<br />Looks like little pieces...
1245880 1247472 ...of plastic.<br />- Set them on that desk.
1251640 1252629 They were...
1253080 1254229 fed to him.
1349840 1350511 Lord.
1358840 1362753 This was found behind the fridge<br />in the obesity murder scene.
1364200 1365838 "Long is the way,
1366120 1368953 and hard, that out of Hell<br />leads up to the light."
1369320 1370070 It's from Milton.
1371120 1372519 "Paradise Lost"
1373080 1373717 Alright,
1373960 1375029 I'm confused.
1375360 1377351 It means that<br />this is a beginning.
1379240 1380912 This was behind the fridge,
1381160 1383151 written in grease.
1383400 1385356 There are 7 deadly sins, Captain.
1386040 1386790 Gluttony,
1389840 1390511 greed,
1393040 1394871 sloth, wrath,
1395240 1397037 pride, lust,
1397800 1398755 and envy.
1399880 1400357 Seven.
1400560 1400958 Hold on.
1401960 1403951 This is not even my desk.
1404440 1407432 You can expect 5 more of these.
1408720 1409755 Wait a minute.
1411280 1413157 I can't get involved in this.
1415560 1416310 Somerset.
1416960 1418279 He wanted it.
1420160 1420751 Damn!
1421200 1422599 I'm all over it.
1455600 1456237 Where to?
1459640 1461232 Far away from here.
1473360 1475316 - A few things to look up.<br />- Okay.
1475600 1477033 Sit where you like.
1477840 1478716 How's everybody?
1480160 1481309 Hiya, Smiley.
1482440 1484476 George, cards are getting cold.
1484880 1486074 Duty calls.
1501600 1502510 Gentlemen.
1503880 1505029 I'll never understand.
1506640 1508039 All these books,
1508280 1510396 a world of knowledge,
1510640 1513916 and what do you do?<br />Play poker all night.
1514360 1516157 We got culture.
1516440 1519398 We got culture<br />coming out our asses.
1522200 1524077 How's this for culture?
1675440 1676395 You know, Smiley...
1677560 1679198 you'll really miss us.
1680960 1682075 I just might.
1737880 1738915 Fucking Dante.
1740000 1743197 Goddamn poetry-writing<br />faggot piece of shit.
1744400 1744957 Fucker.
1756200 1757553 Good work, officer.
1764480 1765515 Thank you, Lord.
1773680 1774635 Oh, sorry.
1776680 1778159 I'll move in a second.
1790360 1792669 - You want your chair?<br />- No, you go ahead.
1792920 1793432 Yeah?
1831040 1831631 Phone.
1832960 1835235 Package deal.<br />Comes with the office.
1840160 1840751 Mills.
1842200 1844430 Honey. You okay?<br />Something wrong?
1845720 1849554 Dingleberry. I told you<br />not to call when I'm at work.
1850720 1851755 Yeah. Why?
1852480 1853037 Why?
1854600 1855316 Why?
1860480 1861071 Okay.
1865520 1866475 It's my wife.
1866960 1867597 Sorry?
1869400 1870879 She'd like to speak to you.
1880640 1882358 This is Detective Somerset.
1884280 1886919 Yes, it's nice<br />to talk to you too.
1888520 1890590 I appreciate the offer, but...
1893360 1895316 In that case, I'd be delighted.
1896440 1898078 Yes, thank you very much.
1899520 1900077 Bye.
1903040 1903916 Honey, what...?
1912040 1912597 Well?
1913560 1914788 - Sorry?<br />- What?
1916000 1919788 I'm invited to late supper<br />at your apartment. I accepted.
1920160 1921957 At my... how's that?
1922560 1923231 Tonight.
1930240 1931468 Hello, men.
1932160 1933354 - Hi, loser.<br />- Hi, idiot.
1936200 1937235 That's Tracy.
1939160 1939797 Hello.
1940760 1942955 Happy to meet you.<br />I've heard a lot about you.
1944240 1945992 Except your first name.
1947600 1948510 It's William.
1949320 1951231 Well, it's a good name.
1951520 1952077 William.
1953360 1955191 I'd like you to meet David.
1955520 1958637 - David, this is William.<br />- Alright, I'll be right back.
1959360 1961999 - How are the kids?<br />- Good, they're in the room.
1964080 1965195 Good dogs.
1965800 1968234 Good dogs.<br />How are you, pretty?
1979200 1980633 - Smells good.<br />- What?
1982680 1984272 Yeah. I mean, thanks.
1986080 1987638 Please have a seat, if you like.
1987880 1991270 - Would you like a drink?<br />- No, thanks. I'll wait.
1992320 1995312 Throw that anywhere.<br />Excuse all this mess.
1995600 1997192 We're still unpacking.
1999560 2002074 I hear you were<br />high school sweethearts.
2004320 2005070 Pretty hokey, huh?
2006960 2007790 You know something?
2008920 2011275 From the first date,<br />I knew he was...
2011560 2012834 ...the guy I'd marry.<br />- Really?
2015240 2016559 He was the funniest guy<br />I'd ever met.
2021240 2021831 Really.
2025240 2027276 It's kind of rare nowadays.
2027720 2029711 I mean, that level...
2029960 2030631 of commitment.
2035600 2036350 Don't worry.
2037440 2038998 I won't wear it to the table.
2041640 2042311 You know,
2042560 2044915 no matter how often I see guns,
2045200 2046110 I can't get used to them.
2047640 2048356 Same here.
2058600 2060989 - Why aren't you married, William?<br />- Tracy...
2061360 2062236 What the hell...?
2062640 2064153 I was close once.
2065320 2066355 It just didn't happen.
2066680 2068033 It surprises me.
2068960 2069790 It really does.
2071800 2072391 Well...
2074040 2077828 anyone who spends much time<br />with me finds me disagreeable.
2079080 2080399 Just ask your husband.
2080640 2081231 Very true.
2081920 2083319 Very, very true.
2084480 2086357 How long have you lived here?
2087280 2087917 Too long.
2091960 2093188 How do you like it?
2095120 2095916 You know,
2096760 2098671 takes time. Settle in,
2100040 2101029 it'll be good.
2101840 2103831 You get numb after a while.
2105040 2106996 There are things to any city.
2112600 2113316 Subway.
2113960 2115837 It'll go away in a minute.
2119600 2121431 Real estate guy.
2121840 2124195 Fucking piece of... sorry honey.
2125160 2128197 Shows us the place a few times,<br />I think he's good.
2128440 2130908 He's efficient.<br />Trace really likes it.
2131360 2135194 Then we wonder why he only<br />brings us here for 5 minutes.
2135640 2137312 We found out the first night.
2137800 2139870 The soothing, relaxing...
2140520 2141919 vibrating home.
2150440 2151190 I'm sorry.
2158640 2160358 Yeah, alright, laugh it up.
2163320 2165117 I don't know why you're laughing.
2169120 2170394 Alright, already.
2174640 2176517 He had to get into the building
2176720 2178915 before the office closed.
2179160 2181594 - Gould would've been working late.<br />- I'm certain.
2181840 2183751 The biggest defense lawyer<br />in town. Infamous, really.
2184080 2186958 The body was found<br />on Tuesday morning.
2187240 2191199 The office was closed Monday.<br />He could've gotten in Friday,
2191520 2194353 laid low till the cleaners left,<br />then had his way
2194600 2197797 with Gould Saturday, Sunday,<br />maybe Monday.
2198480 2199071 Look.
2200200 2201758 Gould was bound, right arm free.
2202080 2203957 He was handed a butcher's knife.
2205960 2208952 - Check out the scale.<br />- A pound of flesh.
2215600 2216749 "One pound of flesh,
2217000 2219070 no more, no less.<br />No cartilage,
2219360 2220110 no bone,
2220680 2222830 only flesh."<br />"Merchant of Venice"
2223120 2223950 Didn't see it.
2224320 2227357 "This task done,<br />and he would go free."
2227840 2229239 That chair was...
2229480 2231675 ...soaked with sweat.<br />- Of course.
2232680 2235353 The killer wanted Gould<br />to take his time,
2235800 2237518 deciding which cut
2237800 2239074 to make first.
2239360 2240429 Imagine it.
2240920 2242558 There's a gun in your face.
2243320 2245709 Which part of your body<br />is expendable?
2245920 2246875 The love handle.
2248080 2250548 Cut along the side<br />of his own stomach.
2251280 2255068 Let's take a fresh look.<br />The corpse is there, but...
2255400 2258472 Iook through it.<br />Edit out your initial shock.
2258720 2261632 The trick is to find<br />one item, one detail...
2261880 2263279 and focus on it...
2263560 2265790 till it's an exhausted possibility.
2266080 2267798 I'll get another beer. Beer?
2268120 2269269 Wine, please.
2278200 2279519 He's preaching.
2280120 2280870 Punishing.
2283240 2286391 The sins were used<br />in medieval sermons.
2286840 2288956 7 cardinal virtues, 7 deadly sins,
2289240 2292152 ...used as teaching tools.<br />- Yeah, like in...
2292440 2295796 - "The Parson's Tale" and Dante.<br />- You read them?
2296040 2296517 Yeah.
2297000 2299309 Parts.<br />Remember in "Purgatory"
2299560 2301198 Dante and his buddy<br />climb up...
2301440 2303829 the hill and check out<br />the sinners?
2305080 2307071 The 7 Terraces of Purgation.
2307320 2308036 Yeah, right.
2308720 2311632 But there, pride comes first,<br />not gluttony.
2311840 2313239 Let's consider the books
2313480 2315948 as the killer's inspiration.
2316200 2319158 The sermons were about<br />atonement for sin.
2319400 2321436 These murders are like<br />forced attrition.
2322120 2322757 Forced what?
2323160 2326118 Attrition's when you<br />regret your sins...
2326320 2329949 ...but not for love of God.<br />- Because of a gun in your face.
2333600 2334715 No fingerprints.
2335080 2335717 No.
2336400 2338868 Totally unrelated victims.
2339520 2341875 And no witnesses.
2342160 2343388 Which I don't get...
2343800 2346439 because the fucker<br />had to get back out.
2347480 2351075 In a major city,<br />minding your business is a science.
2352240 2355710 In rape prevention, they tell you<br />never to cry for help.
2356520 2357873 Always yell "fire!"
2358120 2359348 Nobody answers "help".
2359600 2361397 Holler "fire", they'll come.
2361800 2362789 That's fucked up.
2363280 2366431 He must have left<br />another puzzle piece.
2368080 2371868 Thanks for talking this out,<br />but I got to sleep.
2372240 2373468 I got to walk the dogs.
2373720 2375995 This is just to satisfy<br />my curiosity.
2376280 2379875 - I'm leaving the end of the week.<br />- Shit. No, wait.
2381680 2384319 Gould's wife was out of town.
2384560 2387518 - So this means she saw something.<br />- What if it's a threat?
2387800 2391588 I put her in a safehouse.<br />She wasn't happy about it.
2399200 2401475 What if it isn't<br />what she's seen,
2401800 2405634 but what she's supposed to<br />and hasn't yet?
2406120 2407269 Yeah, okay. What?
2407840 2408477 I don't know.
2410960 2412552 But that's the one thing.
2456400 2457150 I'll sign us in.
2458120 2459872 Gotta see Mrs. Gould.
2466120 2466791 Mrs. Gould?
2473360 2475590 Mrs. Gould, I'm sorry.<br />I truly am.
2476400 2477992 I don't understand.
2478640 2480835 I need you to look at each photo
2481560 2482834 very carefully.
2483320 2486392 See if anything's strange,
2486800 2489109 out of place, anything at all.
2490120 2491269 I don't see anything.
2491560 2492117 You're sure?
2492360 2494590 Please,<br />I can't do this right now.
2494920 2495557 Okay.
2497080 2498399 It's got to be now.
2498640 2500153 Maybe we missed something.
2509640 2510152 Wait.
2510760 2511272 What?
2511760 2512272 Here.
2516240 2518515 This painting, it's upside down.
2526480 2528277 - Your men didn't move this?<br />- No.
2528480 2530994 Those shots were taken<br />before forensics.
2534240 2534797 Nothing.
2536560 2538118 There's got to be something.
2548880 2551155 He moved the screws<br />to re-hang it.
2555560 2556675 What the fuck is that?
2558640 2559914 Switchblade.
2567840 2568716 Goddamn it.
2572680 2574398 There must be something.
2579960 2581598 He didn't paint the fucking thing.
2589560 2592154 No, he's fucking with us.
2593640 2595517 See this, this is us.
2597320 2598469 Just wait a minute.
2601640 2604518 - Somerset's climbing furniture.<br />- Wait a minute.
2610200 2611599 You're kidding me.
2612240 2613514 Call the print lab.
2618920 2619716 Oh, man.
2623640 2624390 Honestly...
2625040 2627429 have you ever seen<br />anything like this?
2629640 2630072 No.
2633160 2635720 The swell pattern tells me<br />they're not...
2635960 2637757 the victim's prints.
2649960 2651712 I say he's whacked enough.
2653680 2654829 It doesn't fit.
2655520 2657033 He doesn't want to stop.
2657320 2658116 Who knows.
2658560 2662189 Freaks doing their evil deeds<br />they don't want to.
2662400 2664755 "Voices made me do it."<br />"My dog made me do it."
2665040 2666632 "Jodie Foster told me to do it."
2667080 2668149 It can take...
2668400 2672075 3 days to make a match,<br />so maybe you guys want to...
2672320 2673878 cross your fingers somewhere else.
2677360 2680158 You meant what you said<br />to Mrs. Gould, didn't you?
2680360 2682635 - About catching this guy.<br />- Yeah.
2685400 2687675 Wish I still thought<br />the way you do.
2689320 2692471 What the hell<br />do you think we're doing?
2693320 2694719 Picking up the pieces.
2696560 2700439 Collecting evidence,<br />taking pictures and samples,
2701320 2703197 writing everything down,
2703480 2705550 noting the times things happened.
2707000 2707796 That's all?
2708480 2709196 That's all.
2710160 2713357 Putting everything into<br />neat piles...
2714280 2717397 and filing it, on the off chance<br />it'll be needed in a courtroom.
2720160 2723311 Picking up diamonds<br />on a desert island,
2723560 2726120 saving them in case<br />we get rescued.
2729440 2730190 Bullshit.
2732840 2736594 Even the most promising clues<br />only lead to others.
2737960 2741748 So many corpses roll away,<br />unrevenged.
2744160 2747630 Don't tell me<br />you didn't get that rush tonight.
2748640 2749470 I saw you.
2750960 2752837 We're getting somewhere.
2767680 2769193 Wake up, Glimmer Twins.
2769680 2770908 We got a winner.
2777080 2780595 He uses the name Victor.<br />Real name: Theodore Allen.
2780840 2783513 Homicide found his prints<br />at the scene.
2783800 2786792 He's got a long history<br />of serious mental illness.
2787040 2789429 He got a very strict,<br />Southern Baptist upbringing.
2790120 2792714 Somewhere along the line,<br />they fell short.
2793040 2796157 Victor dabbled in drugs,<br />armed robbery and assault.
2796400 2799312 Spent time in prison<br />for attempted rape of a minor.
2799560 2802518 His lawyer made sure<br />that didn't last long.
2802760 2806150 By the way, the lawyer was<br />Eli Gould, the "greed" victim.
2806440 2808431 We're finishing this today,<br />ladies and germs.
2808720 2812508 Victor's been out of circulation,<br />but we have a residence for him.
2812800 2815268 - You're not buying this.<br />- Doesn't seem like...
2815520 2818159 ...our guy, does it?<br />- You tell me.
2819240 2821310 Our killer seems to have<br />more purpose.
2849120 2850348 You ever take a bullet?
2850640 2853518 Never in my 34 years.<br />Knock wood.
2855280 2856679 I've only taken my gun out
2856920 2858990 three times,<br />intending to use it.
2859360 2860793 Never pulled the trigger.
2861000 2862069 Not once.
2862880 2863437 You?
2864000 2867151 No, I never took a bullet,<br />but...
2867440 2870113 I pulled my gun once.<br />Shot it once.
2870400 2872231 - Really?<br />- It was my first one of these.
2872480 2874357 We were a secondary unit.
2874640 2877393 I was shaky going in.<br />I was a rookie.
2877640 2880712 We bust open a door,<br />looking for this junkie,
2880960 2882313 and he opened fire on us.
2883560 2885232 One cop got hit in the arm.
2887320 2888719 What was his name?
2890840 2894719 It spun him like a top.<br />Well, more like slow motion.
2896160 2897115 I remember
2899200 2900474 riding in that ambulance...
2900880 2901596 and well...
2902240 2903468 he died right there.
2903960 2904676 Right there.
2906000 2907831 What was his fucking name?
2982760 2985354 SWAT goes before dicks.
2988840 2989875 They love this.
2991200 2991871 Police!
2997160 2997831 Clear!
3021760 3022988 Good morning, sweetheart.
3024520 3026795 Get up now motherfucker, now!
3036000 3037638 Get up, you sack of shit!
3044280 3044996 Fuck me!
3046080 3046796 Dicks!
3047520 3049670 You'll want to look at this.
3052800 3053437 Dicks!
3060960 3061756 Jesus.
3062280 3062871 Victor?
3063440 3065431 - What the hell?<br />- It's just Victor.
3065680 3068513 - Call an ambulance.<br />- Hearse, I'd say.
3068800 3070028 Call for forensics.
3070360 3073432 Get your people out.<br />No on touches anything.
3074280 3075793 It's like a wax sculpture.
3079840 3080556 Sloth.
3090440 3091031 Aw, man.
3091600 3092271 Goddamn.
3093280 3095271 The pictures<br />were dated 3 days ago.
3103360 3104793 This must be the first.
3105000 3105477 Look.
3106560 3108869 It's dated one year ago today.
3110800 3112392 I got a hair sample.
3112640 3114517 I got a stool sample, piss,
3114920 3115796 fingernails.
3118400 3119628 He's laughing at us.
3120000 3121752 You got what you deserved.
3125120 3127270 He's alive!<br />Cocksucker's alive!
3129600 3131636 Guns down!<br />Emergency on that ambulance!
3148160 3150674 - He's playing games.<br />- No shit.
3153040 3155156 We have to divorce our emotions.
3155400 3157311 We must focus on details.
3157560 3160279 I feed off my emotions,<br />how's that?
3160520 3162988 - Are you listening to me?<br />- Yes, I can hear you.
3163320 3164878 - Excuse me.<br />- What are you doing?
3165120 3167315 - Closed crime scene. Out!<br />- I got a right to be here.
3167560 3168913 I'm a UPI photographer.
3169920 3171638 I got a right to be here.
3171880 3173598 - Get out! Jesus!<br />- Fucking jerk!
3173840 3175319 I got your picture, man.
3175680 3176908 I got your picture.
3177200 3180112 Detective Mills, M-i-l-l-s.<br />Fuck off.
3180640 3182392 - You can spell.<br />- Fuck you.
3183040 3185110 How do they get here so quick?
3185520 3188956 The pay police for information.<br />They pay well.
3189760 3190988 Hey, man, I'm sorry.
3193600 3194715 They piss me off.
3194960 3195710 Okay.
3195960 3198758 It's impressive to see<br />a man feeding off his emotions.
3205400 3208198 One year of immobility,<br />judging by...
3208400 3210356 muscle and spine deterioration.
3210600 3213956 Blood tests show a smorgasbord<br />of drugs in his system.
3214200 3216236 Even an antibiotic,<br />probably to prevent
3216440 3219238 the bedsores from infecting.
3219520 3223035 Has he tried to speak,<br />or communicate in any way?
3223360 3226158 Even if his brain<br />were not mush, which it is,
3226400 3229472 he chewed off his tongue long ago.
3231120 3231632 Doc...
3232960 3236111 is there no chance<br />he might survive?
3236760 3239558 He'd die of shock now<br />if you shined a flashlight
3239800 3241392 in his eyes.
3242120 3246318 He's had as much pain<br />and suffering as anyone,
3247720 3250359 and he still has<br />Hell to look forward to.
3250720 3251436 Good night.
3264280 3266874 Hello, William. It's Tracy.
3268120 3268677 Tracy?
3269800 3270630 Everything okay?
3271080 3273230 Yeah. Yes, everything's fine.
3274080 3274956 Where's David?
3275160 3277993 In the other room,<br />in the shower.
3278400 3280789 Sorry to call you like this.
3281360 3282509 It's all right.
3283600 3285033 What can I do for you?
3290520 3292397 I need someone to talk to.
3292640 3295154 Do you think you could<br />meet me somewhere,
3295440 3297476 maybe tomorrow morning?
3298680 3299829 I don't understand.
3301240 3303959 I feel stupid calling,
3305240 3308277 but you're the only person<br />I know here.
3308640 3309993 There's no on else.
3310480 3311595 If you can,
3311960 3314076 give me a call, okay?
3314520 3315873 I have to go now.
3316920 3318672 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
3328120 3328757 I mean...
3329920 3331751 you know this city so well.
3332600 3333510 You've been here...
3334080 3334910 so long.
3337160 3338991 It can be a hard place.
3339320 3341675 I don't know why<br />I asked you to come.
3343360 3345191 Why don't you talk to him?
3345720 3347312 Tell him how you feel.
3348600 3351160 I can't be a burden.
3351400 3352674 Especially now.
3354960 3356598 I'll get used to things,
3357160 3357717 you know?
3358280 3360271 I wanted to talk to someone
3360520 3362909 who's lived here a long time.
3363720 3367633 Upstate, it's a completely<br />different environment.
3372120 3375908 Did David tell you<br />I teach 5th grade? I did.
3377960 3379598 He mentioned it.
3382920 3385639 I've been going around,<br />looking at schools,
3388000 3389956 but here the conditions here
3390400 3391276 are horrible.
3393440 3395158 What about private schools?
3397480 3398117 I don't know.
3400280 3402510 Tell me what's<br />really bothering you.
3405400 3407630 David and I<br />are going to have a baby.
3412320 3413469 Tracy, I...
3415320 3416548 I don't think I'm...
3417280 3418235 the one to talk to...
3418640 3421234 ...about this.<br />- I hate this city.
3425440 3427271 I had a relationship once.
3427960 3429871 It was like a marriage.
3432880 3434233 We got pregnant.
3435640 3437471 This was a long time ago.
3443080 3446197 I remember getting up<br />and going to work.
3448200 3452159 A day like any other,<br />but the first day after I knew
3453000 3453796 about the pregnancy.
3455960 3457837 And I felt this fear,
3458840 3459795 for the first time ever.
3462880 3464154 I remember thinking:
3464920 3467957 How can I bring a child<br />into a world like this?
3468200 3471078 How can a person grow up<br />with all this around them?
3478360 3480271 I told her I didn't want it.
3482600 3484397 Over the next few weeks,
3485640 3487358 I wore her down.
3489920 3491717 I want to have children.
3496320 3497912 I can tell you now that...
3499160 3501071 I know, I mean,
3503280 3504508 I'm positive that
3505160 3506912 I made the right decision.
3507680 3510638 But not a day passes<br />that I don't wish
3510880 3513440 that I'd made<br />a different choice.
3516840 3517716 If you don't...
3518080 3518751 keep the baby...
3520600 3523558 if that's your decision,
3525680 3528069 don't ever tell him<br />you were pregnant.
3529720 3532518 But if you choose to<br />have this baby,
3533320 3534469 then spoil that kid,
3534720 3536597 every chance you get.
3543120 3543836 That's about...
3544120 3544916 all the advice
3545360 3547316 I can give you, Tracy.
3554520 3555270 I got to go.
3556360 3556997 William,
3564480 3565151 thank you.
3578760 3579954 Victor's landlord said
3580200 3582668 there was cash in the mailbox,
3582920 3584399 first of every month.
3589240 3589797 Quote:
3590600 3593114 "I never heard a single complaint<br />from the tenant...
3593360 3596636 in apartment 306,<br />and nobody complained about him.
3596920 3598672 Best tenant I've ever had."
3598920 3600797 A landlord's dream.
3601000 3603036 A paralyzed tenant<br />with no tongue.
3603440 3604839 Who pays the rent on time.
3605800 3607438 I'm sick of this waiting.
3607640 3608629 This is the job.
3609920 3611592 Why aren't we out there?
3611800 3614872 Why sit here rotting,<br />waiting till the lunatic
3615120 3616269 does it again?
3616600 3619433 "Lunatic" is dismissive.<br />Don't make that mistake.
3619720 3622029 Come on. He's insane.<br />Look.
3622280 3626068 Right now he's dancing<br />in his grandma's panties.
3626320 3628709 Rubbing himself in peanut butter.
3629480 3631357 - How's that?<br />- I don't think so.
3633120 3634951 His luck will run out.
3636160 3637752 He's not depending on luck.
3641040 3644828 We walk in exactly one year<br />after Victor's tied to the bed.
3645080 3646399 One year to the day.
3646600 3649114 - He wanted us to.<br />- Don't know that for sure.
3649320 3650196 Oh, yes we do.
3651680 3655309 The note he left,<br />his first words to us:
3655560 3657915 "Long is the way and hard<br />that out of Hell
3658160 3660071 leads up to light."
3661560 3662879 Fuck him. So what?
3663160 3664434 He's right so far.
3665000 3668788 Imagine the will to keep<br />a man bound for a year.
3669360 3671510 To sever his hand<br />and to use it...
3671760 3673239 to plant fingerprints.
3673480 3675789 To insert tubes into<br />his genitals.
3676480 3678869 The guy's methodical, exacting
3679120 3680997 and worst of all, patient.
3681400 3682879 He's a nutbag.
3683160 3686675 Because he's got a library card<br />doesn't make him Yoda.
3691440 3692350 You got money?
3693080 3694559 I got 50 bucks.
3694880 3696950 I propose a field trip.<br />Come on.
3700760 3703354 We'll make a list.<br />At the top we put "Purgatory",
3703640 3707269 "Canterbury Tales"<br />anything on the 7 deadly sins.
3707560 3708788 - Ask yourself.<br />- Wait.
3709000 3711673 What would he study<br />to do things he's done?
3711920 3713399 What are his interests now?
3714200 3716156 Jack the Ripper, for instance.
3716400 3717913 - Where are we going?<br />- Library.
3731480 3734040 Coupons!<br />Free coupons!
3734280 3735599 Discount coupons!
3736920 3738956 They must have had<br />about 50 health violations
3739160 3741276 during the last inspection.
3741520 3744114 Sit across from me.<br />I don't want people thinking
3744320 3745548 we're dating.
3746040 3746950 Give me your money.
3748880 3752589 I'll give you this,<br />but I must know what we're doing.
3757720 3759312 Somerset. How you doing?
3759640 3762154 Didn't expect a m�nage � trois.
3762400 3764277 It's not a problem. Sit down.
3769680 3772478 Only for you do I do this.<br />It's a big risk.
3772840 3775832 - We're just fair and square.<br />- It's a deal.
3781120 3782394 About an hour.
3784520 3785839 Yeah. Help yourself.
3788680 3790352 That was money well spent.
3791680 3792157 Yeah.
3800280 3800917 Alright.
3801640 3805110 Telling you this, I'm trusting you<br />more than I trust most people.
3805360 3807430 Good, I'm about ready<br />to punch you.
3809240 3812630 It's probably nothing,<br />but it's no skin off our teeth.
3815880 3818678 The pizza parlor guy<br />is a friend from the FBI.
3820600 3821669 Who, stinky man?
3822520 3826308 For years, the FBI's been hooked<br />into the library system.
3826560 3828869 - Keeping records.<br />- Assessing fines?
3829080 3831640 No, monitoring reading habits.
3832120 3834031 Certain books are flagged.
3834400 3836470 Books on, say, nuclear weapons,
3836960 3838279 "Mein Kampf".
3838960 3843033 Anyone checks out a flagged book,<br />his library records go to the FBI.
3843760 3845671 Wait. How is this legal?
3845880 3848758 Legal, illegal.<br />These terms don't apply.
3850040 3853635 You can't use the information<br />directly. It's a guide.
3854200 3857988 Sounds silly, but you can't<br />get a library card
3858200 3860919 without an ID card<br />and current phone bill.
3862520 3864397 - So they run a list.<br />- Precisely.
3865280 3867157 If you want to know who's reading
3867360 3870636 "Purgatory", "Paradise Lost"<br />and "Helter Skelter",
3870880 3874236 the FBI's computers will tell us.<br />It could give us a name.
3875000 3877833 Of a college kid<br />writing a term paper
3878040 3879393 on 20th century crime.
3880120 3881997 At least you're out of the office.
3882360 3883270 Get a haircut.
3884840 3886796 - How do you know this?<br />- I don't.
3887400 3889356 - Neither do you.<br />- Exactly.
3897720 3899278 "Divine Comedy",
3899840 3903674 "History of Catholicism",<br />one called "Murderers and Madmen".
3903920 3907151 "Modern Homicide Investigation",<br />"In Cold Blood".
3907800 3909074 "Of Human Bondage".
3909320 3911311 - Bondage?<br />- It's not what you think.
3912160 3913798 Marquis de Sha-day.
3914520 3916238 - Marquis de Sade.<br />- Whatever.
3916480 3918789 Writings of Saint Thomas<br />Aqua-something.
3919040 3920792 Saint Thomas Aquinas.<br />There.
3921040 3923349 He wrote about<br />the 7 deadly sins.
3923960 3925518 - Is that it?<br />- Yep.
3927160 3929355 - Let's try it.<br />- Jonathan Doe?
3929880 3930676 Whatever.
3931360 3933237 We're sure about that name?
3933880 3936075 You were, you saw it.<br />John Doe.
3936600 3938352 You want to go back, I'll go back.
3939000 3941150 Let's take a look at him,<br />talk to him.
3941880 3943108 This is crazy.
3943480 3945357 We'll just talk to him.
3946360 3949193 "Excuse me, sir.<br />Are you a serial killer?"
3950960 3951597 Okay.
3952560 3953436 You do the talking.
3955200 3957395 Put that silver tongue<br />of yours to work.
3957640 3959198 You been talking to my wife?
3963080 3963990 Retarded.
3964520 3966511 Charlie's fucking Angels.
3967160 3969037 A name off a computer.
3972760 3973317 Mills.
3984280 3985793 - You hit?<br />- No.
3989080 3990308 He's going down.
4006840 4007750 Fifth floor.
4027400 4029072 Police.<br />Is there a back way out?
4030440 4031555 Lock your door.
4034360 4035873 Get out of the fucking hall.
4061240 4061831 Get down.
4064440 4065350 Get the fuck down!
4158880 4159551 Goddamn it!
4220080 4221832 Out of the fucking way! Clear!
4280760 4281351 Mills!
4283360 4283997 Go.
4318520 4319191 Where are you going?
4319800 4321711 - I'm going in.<br />- No, wait.
4323160 4325037 - Wait.<br />- What? He shot at us!
4325280 4326156 You can't go in.
4326400 4329551 - We need a warrant.<br />- We got probable cause. Come on.
4329800 4332598 Think how we got here.
4332840 4335752 - I can't tell about the FBI.<br />- Get out of the way.
4336000 4339629 We have no reason to be here.<br />Listen to me.
4339880 4343190 - Get the fuck off me.<br />- Alright. I'm sorry.
4343480 4345357 Just pay attention a minute.
4345840 4349196 With a hole like this,<br />we won't be able to prosecute.
4349440 4352079 The guy will walk.<br />That's what you want?
4352320 4355596 By the time we clear a warrant...<br />Fuck that!
4355840 4358798 We need a reason<br />to knock on this door.
4359680 4360351 Think about it.
4362600 4363191 Okay?
4367360 4367997 Okay.
4368280 4370510 You're right.<br />I'm all fucked up.
4370760 4371875 When you're right, you're right.
4380120 4380711 Well...
4381880 4383438 no point in arguing anymore.
4385080 4386672 Unless you can fix that.
4389280 4390793 You stupid son of a...
4399160 4400639 How much money we got left?
4401880 4404758 So, I noticed this guy<br />going out a lot,
4405040 4408828 when the murders was happening,<br />so I...
4409120 4411588 - So you called Detective Somerset?<br />- Right.
4411840 4413796 - She called Somerset.<br />- 'Cause this guy...
4414040 4416679 was creepy and shit<br />and one of the murders
4416960 4419758 ...happened over there.<br />- I told you the rest.
4420000 4421558 - Got everything?<br />- I got your story.
4421800 4423597 Have her sign.<br />You gotta sign.
4424800 4425391 Good.
4426840 4427716 You did good.
4428440 4430431 - I did what you said.<br />- Here.
4430680 4432398 You get something to eat.
4436240 4437673 Everybody stay outside.
4497080 4497751 Victor.
4606120 4606632 Fuck.
4626120 4626711 Somerset.
4636000 4637592 - What?<br />- We had him.
4638800 4639471 What are you saying?
4640560 4641993 Fucking photographer...
4642240 4643195 on the stairs.
4648080 4650150 We had him<br />and we let him go.
4656640 4657993 You sure this is him?
4658360 4661113 Yep. Good.<br />Get it out.
4661520 4663078 We've got nothing to go on.
4663280 4665999 No pay stubs, appointment books.<br />Just this receipt.
4666200 4667599 - Keep looking.<br />- Wait, look at this.
4667840 4670434 This was under the bed.<br />His only source of funds?
4670720 4672915 We got his money.<br />I like it.
4673160 4674991 You won't believe this.
4675760 4678069 We haven't found a fingerprint.<br />Not one.
4678360 4680874 Right. I don't believe you.<br />Keep looking.
4685720 4687039 We could us some more men.
4687280 4688349 I'm doing my best.
4689280 4692716 - What are you getting?<br />- There are 2,000 notebooks here.
4692960 4695474 Each one has about 250 pages.
4695720 4697358 What about the killings?
4698480 4702314 "We're sick, ridiculous puppets.<br />What gross stage we dance on.
4702560 4704676 What fun, dancing and fucking.
4704920 4708310 Not a care in the world.<br />Not knowing that we're nothing.
4708560 4710516 We are not what was intended."
4710760 4712193 Wait, there's a lot more.
4714040 4717271 "On the subway today,<br />a man started a conversation.
4717760 4721548 Small talk, a lonely man talking<br />about the weather and things.
4721880 4723552 I tried to be pleasant,
4723840 4727037 but my head began to hurt<br />from his banality.
4727280 4728713 I almost didn't notice,
4728960 4731394 but I suddenly<br />threw up all over him.
4731920 4733797 He was not pleased,
4734160 4736116 and I couldn't stop laughing."
4737320 4738230 No dates.
4738960 4741997 Placed on the shelves<br />in no discernable order.
4742960 4744712 His mind poured out on paper.
4745560 4747516 Looks like a life's work.
4747760 4750911 With 50 men,<br />reading 24 hour shifts,
4751160 4753037 ...it'd take 2 months.<br />- I know.
4761200 4763270 Phone? Phone?
4766640 4767550 People, quiet!
4783800 4784835 I admire you.
4786320 4789517 I don't know how you found me.<br />Imagine my surprise.
4790520 4793830 I respect you officers<br />more every day.
4794080 4796036 I appreciate that, John.
4796920 4798592 - I tell you...<br />- No, listen.
4798840 4802674 I'm readjusting my schedule<br />in light of today's setback.
4802920 4804990 I just had to call<br />to express my admiration.
4805240 4806639 Sorry I had to hurt...
4806880 4810111 one of you,<br />but I had no choice, did I?
4810360 4811839 Accept my apology?
4812080 4815277 I'd like to say more,<br />but that'd ruin the surprise.
4822400 4823116 Got it.
4828040 4829075 Everybody back to work.
4831640 4832629 You were right.
4833680 4834669 He's preaching.
4837080 4839196 These murders are<br />his sermons to us.
4839600 4842160 Look, we know him.<br />We know him.
4845360 4846713 Who's the blonde?
4851000 4852399 Looks like a 'pro'.
4852680 4853271 Maybe.
4854040 4856031 She caught John Doe's eye.
4861920 4864514 - He collected it last night.<br />- Last night?
4864760 4866239 - Yeah.<br />- This man?
4866480 4869677 Yeah, John Doe.<br />Easy name to remember. Had a limp.
4869920 4872878 - And the job you did for him?<br />- I've got a picture.
4873120 4875111 One sweet piece, actually.
4875360 4877715 I thought he was<br />a performance artist.
4877960 4879678 The sort of guy that
4879880 4882519 pisses in a cup on stage
4882760 4883954 and then drinks it.
4884160 4885070 Performance art.
4885520 4886157 Right.
4889560 4891437 I think I undercharged him.
4891760 4893716 - You made this for him?<br />- Yeah, I've made...
4893960 4895678 weirder shit than that.
4901040 4902712 They found the blonde.
4905800 4906596 The picture!
4907200 4908519 The picture!
4909880 4911074 Fucking pigs!
4913440 4916079 - I need you to move.<br />- I'll come out, but you guys...
4916360 4918191 Get out of the booth!
4918520 4920590 I've been in this cage<br />the whole time.
4922000 4923115 Come on, this way.
4930080 4933755 - Can you stop this music?<br />- We're looking for the guy.
4946640 4948631 You from Homicide?<br />You better...
4948880 4949835 see this.
4959160 4960832 Get this thing off me!
4961240 4963117 God, get it off me!
4965160 4966513 Get him out of here, now!
4968040 4969519 I want to hear it again.
4969960 4971188 Tell me again.
4973600 4976558 You heard nothing strange,<br />saw nothing strange.
4977240 4978150 - No.<br />- No?
4980400 4982311 He ask me if I was married.
4982800 4985030 - I saw a gun in his hand.<br />- Where was the girl?
4985440 4986953 The what?
4987600 4989955 The prostitute. Where was she?
4990240 4992754 Someone comes to<br />your establishment...
4993000 4996276 they want to go downstairs,<br />get some ooh-la-la. Whatever.
4996960 4998871 They got to come to you.
4999720 5000232 Yeah.
5000640 5001789 You didn't see anyone?
5002680 5005831 With a package? A knapsack?<br />Something under their arm?
5006080 5009959 Everybody comes in with<br />a package under their arm.
5010440 5013512 Some guys carry suitcases<br />full of stuff.
5013840 5015717 She was just sitting on the bed.
5022440 5024670 Who tied her down? You or him?
5025080 5027116 Do you like what you do?
5027480 5028799 These things you see?
5029080 5029637 No.
5031400 5032435 No, I don't.
5034360 5035236 But that's life,
5035440 5036031 isn't it?
5040680 5042079 He had a gun.
5044080 5045832 And he made it happen.
5047680 5049591 He made me do it.
5050120 5051997 He put me that thing on me.
5053160 5055310 He made me wear it.
5055800 5056391 Then he...
5057160 5059037 told me to fuck her.
5061080 5063116 And I did. I fucked her.
5063960 5065234 Oh, God! Oh, God!
5065560 5067710 He had a gun<br />in my mouth.
5068320 5071039 The fucking gun<br />was in my throat.
5071560 5072231 Fuck.
5075720 5077438 Oh, God. God.
5078120 5080634 God, help me.<br />Please, help me.
5098280 5099713 This won't have a happy ending.
5100920 5103354 - It's not possible.<br />- We catch him, I'll be happy.
5106480 5109597 If we catch John Doe<br />and he's the Devil,
5109880 5111472 if he's Satan himself,
5111720 5113790 that might meet<br />our expectations.
5114640 5115834 But he's not the Devil.
5117440 5118793 He's just a man.
5119600 5120271 You know?
5121400 5124198 You bitch and you complain<br />and you tell me these things.
5124440 5128274 If you think you're preparing me<br />for hard times,
5128720 5129630 thanks but...
5130280 5132271 But you got to be a hero.
5133480 5134959 You want to be a champion.
5135200 5138351 People don't want a champion.<br />They want cheeseburgers...
5138600 5141114 - play lotto and watch TV.<br />- How did you get like this?
5141560 5142595 I want to know.
5147240 5149708 It wasn't one thing,<br />I'll tell you that.
5151160 5151910 Go on.
5155440 5158477 I don't think I can continue<br />to live in a place...
5158720 5162110 that embraces, nurtures apathy<br />as if it was a virtue.
5162520 5164192 You aren't different or better.
5164520 5166829 I didn't say I was. I'm not.
5167120 5170032 Hell, I sympathize.<br />I sympathize completely.
5170320 5172072 Apathy is a solution.
5172520 5175830 It's easier to lose yourself<br />in drugs...
5176040 5177917 than it is to cope with life.
5178240 5181869 It's easier to steal what you want<br />than earn it. It's easier...
5182120 5186272 to beat a child than to raise it.<br />Love costs. It takes work.
5186640 5189108 We're talking about<br />mentally ill people.
5189360 5191316 We're talking about crazies.
5191600 5193033 - No, we're not.<br />- Yes. Today.
5193320 5196312 No, we're talking about<br />everyday life here.
5196680 5198989 You can't afford<br />to be this naive.
5199840 5201068 Fuck off.
5203360 5204679 You should listen to yourself.
5205160 5206513 Yeah. You say that...
5207120 5209429 the problem is people don't care.
5210120 5212076 So, I don't care<br />about people.
5212360 5213952 Nonsense. You know why?
5214680 5215396 You care?
5215640 5217278 Want to know? Damn right.
5217520 5218839 You'll make a difference.
5219080 5221275 Whatever. The point is that...
5221640 5224108 you're not quitting<br />because you believe...
5224360 5225952 these things you say.
5226440 5227668 You want to believe them...
5228000 5229558 because you're quitting.
5231240 5233800 And you want me<br />to agree with you and say,
5234040 5235951 "You're right, it's a fucking mess.
5236200 5239829 We should all go live in<br />a fucking log cabin."
5240840 5241750 But I won't.
5242720 5243630 I won't say that.
5245480 5248040 I don't agree with you.<br />I do not.
5252040 5252631 I can't.
5262760 5263795 I'm going home.
5272000 5273319 Thank you, though.
5302480 5303390 I love you.
5304760 5305875 So much.
5314000 5314716 I know.
5375080 5376957 911, What's your emergency?
5378440 5379589 Could you repeat that?
5380840 5382239 I've done it again.
5392400 5393196 What have we got?
5393880 5395074 Sleeping pills.
5396920 5398273 Glued to one hand.
5398600 5399999 Telephoned glued to the other.
5401680 5402829 You see what he did?
5403880 5405233 He sliced her up.
5405800 5407153 Then he bandaged her.
5407720 5409597 "Call for help and you'll live.
5409880 5411632 But you'll be disfigured.
5413480 5415789 Or put yourself out<br />of your own misery."
5416680 5417430 Come on.
5418120 5419314 He cut off her nose.
5419560 5421039 To spite her face.
5421280 5423271 He did it very recently.
5430520 5431157 Listen,
5432400 5435198 I've decided to stay on<br />till this is done.
5435520 5438671 One of two things will happen.<br />We'll get John Doe,
5438920 5442071 or he'll kill 7<br />and this case will never end.
5442320 5445471 Don't do me any favors.<br />Thanks, but I got it.
5445720 5448280 I'm asking to be<br />your partner a few days more.
5448520 5450158 You'd be doing me a favor.
5460880 5463110 You knew I'd say yes.<br />We're here!
5463480 5466631 Your wife called.<br />Get an answer machine.
5469520 5470270 Detective?
5472280 5473918 After this, I'm gone.
5474920 5476956 - No big surprise.<br />- Detective!
5480080 5481433 You're looking for me.
5484200 5485189 Don't fucking move.
5485640 5486436 On the floor!
5486800 5488472 - Stay back!<br />- On the fucking floor!
5488800 5489710 I know you.
5489920 5491148 Now, get down!
5491880 5493233 Get down on your stomach.
5493520 5494748 You piece of shit. Now!
5495080 5497036 All the way!<br />All the way, fucker!
5497760 5498431 Down!
5498880 5499630 Faster.
5500200 5502156 Faster, fucker. Now.
5502440 5503839 Nose on the ground.
5507320 5509914 Jesus Christ.<br />What the fuck is this?
5510160 5513152 I'd like to speak<br />to my lawyer, please.
5514880 5515869 Godamnit!
5518560 5522553 He cuts the skin off<br />his fingertips. That's why...
5522880 5524836 we found no prints<br />in his apartment.
5525120 5527111 He's been doing it for a while.
5527400 5529675 The bank accounts? The guns?
5529960 5531712 So far it's a dead end.
5531960 5534394 No credit history,<br />no employment records.
5534600 5537478 A 5 year old bank account<br />opened with cash.
5537760 5539876 We tried tracing his furniture.
5540200 5541519 All we know about him...
5541800 5544633 is he's independently wealthy,
5544880 5545710 well-educated,
5546080 5547672 and totally insane.
5547920 5550036 Because he's John Doe by choice.
5550480 5554189 - When can we question him?<br />- You don't. He goes to court now.
5554440 5558069 No way he'd turn himself in.<br />It makes no sense.
5558480 5559390 There he sits.
5559720 5561756 It's not supposed to<br />make any sense.
5562000 5563069 He's not finished.
5563320 5566153 He's pissing in our faces<br />and we're taking it.
5566840 5568319 You know what I'm saying.
5569000 5572470 For the first time,<br />you and I are in agreement.
5572760 5573988 He wouldn't just stop.
5574400 5575833 So what the fuck, man?
5576360 5579477 He's two murders away<br />from completing his masterpiece.
5580840 5582512 We'll wait for his plea.
5586120 5589954 My client says there are<br />two more bodies hidden away.
5590320 5593551 He will only take<br />Detectives Mills and Somerset
5593760 5595034 to these bodies,
5595280 5597157 only at 6 o'clock today.
5597400 5598276 Why us?
5599040 5600519 He says he admires you.
5602160 5603388 Part of the game.
5603720 5607679 If they don't accept the offer,<br />the bodies won't be found.
5608440 5610158 Frankly, I'd let them rot.
5611680 5612954 We've got him.
5613160 5615754 Downstairs, locked up.<br />He'll get...
5616000 5618230 free room and board, cable TV.
5618520 5622069 My wife doesn't even have cable!
5622360 5626478 Something stinks. And this one,<br />you, in your $3.000 suit,
5626800 5630679 smug smile on your face,<br />dealing for that piece of shit.
5631200 5631871 Mills!
5632120 5633792 The law requires me to serve...
5634000 5637151 my clients' interest<br />as best I can.
5637480 5639516 We don't make deals here,<br />Mr. Swarr.
5639760 5640954 My client informs you
5641160 5643720 that if you don't accept,<br />he'll plead insanity.
5644840 5645750 Let him try it.
5646640 5647629 I'd like to see it.
5647880 5651509 With the extreme nature<br />of these crimes, I'd get him off
5651760 5652909 with such a plea.
5653240 5655435 I won't let this conviction slide.
5655880 5659475 If you accept his conditions,<br />he'll sign a confession,
5659720 5662188 plead guilty right now.
5662520 5664715 It's your case.<br />Make a decision.
5666400 5668834 Full confession. I'm in.
5669280 5670872 Has to be both of you.
5672200 5674111 If he claims insanity,
5674440 5677193 this conversation is inadmissible.
5677560 5679471 Blackmailing with his plea.
5679720 5682234 My client wants to remind you,<br />two more are dead.
5682440 5685716 The press'd love to find out<br />the police weren't concerned
5685960 5688076 about finding and burying them.
5688360 5690237 If there are two more dead.
5690520 5691794 The lab report came.
5692040 5694554 They did a quickie on<br />Doe's clothes and fingernails.
5694800 5697917 They found blood<br />from Doe's fingers,
5698200 5701397 blood from the woman<br />whose face he cut off,
5701640 5703119 and a third party,
5703360 5704952 as yet unidentified.
5708440 5710431 You'd be escorting<br />an unarmed man.
5713400 5714799 Let's finish it.
5718280 5721113 If John Doe's head splits open<br />and a UFO flies out,
5721480 5723311 I want you to expect it.
5725560 5726231 I will.
5729280 5731794 If I accidentally<br />shave off a nipple,
5732040 5734110 would it be covered by<br />worker's comp?
5738560 5739549 I suppose so.
5741360 5743794 If you were man enough<br />to file a claim,
5744000 5746673 I'd buy you one myself.
5747520 5750717 I keep coming home late,<br />my wife'll think something's up.
5759400 5760037 You know...?
5761920 5762432 Yeah.
5768800 5769391 What?
5837160 5839037 Will this wind hurt us?
5885960 5887075 Who are you, John?
5888120 5889348 Who are you really?
5890000 5891274 What do you mean?
5891520 5894956 At this stage, there's no harm<br />telling us about yourself?
5895480 5898631 Doesn't matter who I am.<br />It means absolutely nothing.
5898920 5900478 Stay on your left up here.
5904240 5905514 Where are we heading?
5906880 5907710 You'll see.
5908600 5911751 We're not just picking up<br />two more bodies, are we?
5912360 5914191 That wouldn't be shocking enough.
5914440 5917113 You've got the papers<br />to think about, yeah?
5918400 5920391 Wanting people to listen,
5920640 5921675 you can't just...
5921880 5924110 tap them on the shoulder anymore.
5924360 5926396 You have to use a sledgehammer.
5926720 5929632 Then you'll get<br />their strict attention.
5929880 5931199 But the question is:
5931680 5934240 Why are you so special<br />that people should listen?
5934640 5935789 I'm not special.
5936800 5938711 I've never been exceptional.
5939440 5942034 This is, though.<br />What I'm doing.
5942280 5943110 My work.
5943560 5944788 Your work, John?
5945280 5945871 Yes.
5946480 5949358 I don't see anything<br />special about it, John.
5950720 5951789 That's not true.
5952040 5955794 No, it is. Funny thing is,<br />after all this work,
5956040 5960079 in 2 months no one'll care,<br />give a shit, or remember.
5960680 5963478 You can't see<br />the complete act yet.
5964400 5965992 But when this is done,
5967320 5968514 when it's finished,
5970240 5971434 it's going to be...
5974600 5977433 People will barely be able<br />to comprehend.
5977920 5979911 But they won't be able to deny.
5981320 5982958 Could the freak be more vague?
5984040 5985439 As far as master plans go...
5986120 5988236 I can't wait for you to see.
5988520 5990078 It's going to be something.
5991080 5993548 Know what?<br />I'll be standing next to you.
5993840 5996877 So when this thing happens,<br />be sure and let me know.
5997120 5998269 I don't want to miss it.
5998520 6001592 Don't worry. You won't.
6003520 6005590 You won't miss a thing.
6031000 6032433 What's so exciting?
6033600 6034999 It's not too far now.
6042560 6045836 I tried to figure out something.<br />Maybe you can help me?
6048600 6052388 When a person is insane,<br />as you clearly are,
6052640 6054153 do you know you're insane?
6055080 6056593 Maybe you're reading,
6056840 6058671 masturbating in your own feces,
6058920 6060592 do you just stop and go:
6060920 6064151 "Wow, it's amazing how<br />fucking crazy I really am"?
6064640 6066835 Yeah? You guys do that?
6067320 6070153 It's more comfortable for you<br />to label me insane.
6070400 6071515 It's very comfortable.
6072280 6075158 It's not something<br />I'd expect you to accept.
6075720 6078439 But I did not choose.<br />I was chosen.
6078720 6079755 Whatever.
6079960 6082349 I don't doubt<br />that you believe that.
6082920 6084399 But it seems that you're...
6084800 6086995 overlooking a contradiction.
6087200 6087996 Meaning what?
6089280 6090713 Glad you asked.
6092360 6093998 If you were chosen,
6094240 6096276 by a higher power,
6096520 6097236 if your hand was forced,
6098560 6100278 it seems strange
6100920 6103832 you'd get<br />such enjoyment.
6104560 6106790 You enjoyed torturing those people.
6107880 6110872 That doesn't seem to fit<br />with martyrdom, does it?
6112360 6112997 John?
6118360 6122433 I doubt I enjoyed it any more than<br />Mills would enjoy time with me
6122760 6124671 in a room without windows.
6125280 6126156 Isn't that true?
6126960 6128359 How'd you like to...
6128600 6131319 - hurt me with impunity?<br />- That hurts my feelings.
6131920 6133148 I would never.
6133400 6135868 Only because<br />there's consequences.
6137200 6139350 It's in your eyes, though.
6140000 6142514 Nothing wrong with a man<br />talking pleasure in his work.
6143040 6145759 I won't deny<br />my own personal desire...
6146000 6147911 to turn each sin<br />against the sinner.
6148640 6152076 Wait, I thought all you did<br />was kill innocent people.
6153920 6156434 Innocent?<br />Is that supposed to be funny?
6157360 6158270 An obese man.
6158960 6161349 A disgusting man<br />who could barely stand,
6161600 6165559 who you'd point out so your<br />friends would join you mocking him.
6165800 6169713 If you saw him while you ate,<br />you couldn't finish your meal.
6170720 6174190 Then the lawyer. You had to<br />secretly thank me for that.
6174640 6177279 A man dedicated to making money
6177600 6181434 by lying with every breath<br />he could muster to keep
6181680 6183955 murderers and rapists...
6184160 6185798 ...on the streets.<br />- Murderers?
6186640 6187390 Murderers, like yourself.
6187640 6191394 A woman so ugly inside,<br />she couldn't go on living
6191640 6193676 if she wasn't beautiful outside?
6193960 6197714 A drug dealer.<br />A pederast, actually.
6197960 6200872 Let's not forget<br />the disease-spreading whore.
6203200 6205236 Only in a world this shitty...
6205640 6209076 could you say they were innocent<br />and keep a straight face.
6212200 6213553 But that's the point.
6215040 6218032 We see a deadly sin<br />on every street corner,
6218280 6219713 in every home,
6220000 6220910 and we tolerate it.
6221520 6223795 We tolerate it because<br />it's common.
6224360 6225236 It's trivial.
6226080 6228719 We tolerate it morning,<br />noon and night.
6232000 6233353 Well, not anymore.
6235960 6237518 I'm setting the example.
6239200 6240713 And what I've done
6241040 6242189 will be puzzled over
6242720 6243835 and studied
6245320 6246514 and followed...
6248480 6249390 forever.
6250320 6250957 Yeah.
6252560 6253754 Delusions of grandeur.
6255880 6257472 You should be thanking me.
6258120 6259189 Why's that, John?
6259440 6262193 Because you'll be remembered<br />after this.
6262560 6266030 Realize, the only reason<br />that I'm here now...
6266440 6268317 is that I wanted to be.
6268560 6270790 No, we would have got you.
6271080 6271990 Really?
6272440 6276479 Were you biding your time?<br />Toying with me?
6277000 6279798 Allowing 5 "innocent" people<br />to die...
6280040 6282235 until you sprang your trap?
6282520 6284192 What was the evidence...
6284480 6287074 you were going to use on me...
6287320 6290710 right before I walked up<br />and put my hands in the air?
6291000 6292592 John. Calm down.
6292880 6295394 I remember us knocking<br />on your door.
6296480 6297356 That's right.
6297800 6300758 And I remember<br />breaking your face.
6305360 6307590 You're alive because<br />I didn't kill you.
6308000 6309274 Okay, sit back.
6309520 6310191 I spared you.
6310440 6311316 Sit back.
6311600 6313795 Remember that when you<br />look in the mirror...
6314040 6315917 for the rest of your life.
6316200 6319351 Or I should say<br />the rest of the life...
6319560 6320675 I allow you to have.
6320920 6322638 Sit back, you fucking freak!
6322920 6324319 Shut your fucking mouth.
6325920 6330072 You're no messiah.<br />You're a T-shirt,
6330480 6331469 at best.
6344600 6346909 Don't ask me<br />to pity those people.
6347160 6350835 I mourn them as much as the<br />thousands at Sodom and Gomorrah.
6351200 6355193 You're saying you were doing<br />God's good work?
6358760 6361433 The Lord works<br />in mysterious ways.
6363640 6365710 See those high-tension towers?
6366160 6367513 That's where we're headed.
6367760 6370479 I see it. 9 o'clock,<br />and follow that road.
6383840 6386479 There sure as shit<br />ain't no ambush out here.
6386720 6388915 No fucking nothing out here.
6389360 6392318 They'll come behind us<br />in about two minutes.
6392640 6394517 I want you to go way up.
6394760 6397797 In 30 seconds,<br />bank east on my mark.
6457320 6458196 I'll get him out.
6464880 6465517 Get out.
6466800 6467550 Slowly.
6468560 6469117 Stop.
6470720 6471391 Stay.
6474920 6475875 What do you got?
6477600 6478396 A dead dog.
6480520 6481589 I didn't do that.
6488560 6489595 What time is it?
6490480 6491196 Why?
6491680 6492829 I'd like to know.
6496160 6497195 7:01.
6500400 6501230 It's close.
6502400 6503594 Let's go take a look.
6507160 6508036 It's this way.
6554720 6556597 Down. Down. Down.
6558560 6559356 Watch him.
6561240 6562070 There he goes.
6563240 6565310 It's good we have<br />some time to talk.
6571320 6573959 The guy in red.<br />Keep the crosshairs on him.
6581480 6582754 A van's coming down the road.
6583240 6583911 From the north.
6593320 6597108 Be ready for anything.<br />Wait for my signal.
6602760 6603431 Get out!
6606200 6606916 Out!
6607240 6609117 Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot.
6609360 6610110 Step away.
6611240 6613117 Turn around.<br />Hands on your head.
6613760 6614636 What's going on?
6615880 6616835 Why are you here?
6617120 6620396 I'm delivering a package<br />to this guy, David.
6620880 6621790 Detective...
6622200 6623189 David Mills.
6630240 6631912 Get it. Slowly.
6644360 6646555 A guy paid me $500 to bring it.
6646920 6648990 He wanted it here<br />at exactly 7 o'clock.
6649640 6650755 Put it down.
6651960 6652995 We got a box.
6653280 6655589 We got a box.<br />Call the bomb squad.
6655920 6657239 Bomb squad, we got a box.
6657560 6658993 Face the van.
6659720 6660470 Hands up.
6668200 6668996 Turn around.
6670640 6671755 Okay, go.
6672080 6673479 Off you go. Go.
6675520 6677351 I sent the driver out on foot.
6681080 6682195 He's headed north.
6682440 6683156 Have him picked up.
6693040 6693756 I don't know.
6700760 6701590 I'm going to open it.
6702320 6705357 When I said I admired you,<br />I meant what I said.
6724040 6724756 It's blood.
6725080 6727275 You've made yourself quite a life.
6727760 6731070 - You should be very proud.<br />- Shut up, you piece of shit.
6757640 6758914 California, stay away.
6759160 6761037 Stay away. Don't come in here.
6761800 6763597 Whatever you hear, stay away.
6764760 6766512 John Doe has the upper hand.
6766840 6767431 Mills!
6768280 6769076 Here he comes.
6769560 6771118 - Throw your gun down.<br />- What?
6771360 6773476 - I wish I could've lived like you.<br />- Shut up.
6773720 6774630 What are you saying?
6776440 6777634 Do you hear me, Detective?
6778040 6779439 I'm trying to tell you...
6779680 6781989 how I admire you<br />and your pretty wife.
6783040 6783631 What?
6784320 6784991 Tracy.
6786200 6788509 - What did you fucking say?<br />- It's disturbing...
6788760 6791433 how easily a member<br />of the press can get...
6791680 6793238 information from your precinct.
6793560 6794629 What the fuck?
6795440 6796793 Throw your gun down!
6797600 6799477 I visited your home this morning,
6800280 6801759 after you left.
6802680 6804352 I tried to play husband.
6805000 6808151 I tried to taste<br />the life of a simple man.
6808440 6809270 Throw it away!
6809720 6811233 It didn't work out.
6811960 6812710 So...
6813720 6815472 I took a souvenir.
6817120 6818758 Her pretty head.
6823520 6825795 - What's he talking about?<br />- Give me your gun.
6826040 6827109 What's going on?
6828440 6829156 Put the gun down.
6829400 6830549 What was in the box?
6830840 6832353 I envy your normal life.
6832680 6833510 Drop the gun.
6833800 6835358 It seems envy is my sin.
6835600 6837272 - What's in the box?<br />- Give me the gun.
6837520 6838873 What's in the fucking box?
6839480 6840708 He just told you.
6840960 6843918 You lie! You're a<br />fucking liar! Shut up!
6844640 6847154 That's what he wants.<br />He wants you to shoot him.
6851240 6852434 Say it's not true.
6852720 6854631 - That's not true.<br />- Become vengeance.
6854920 6855955 She's all right.
6856280 6856996 Become...
6857640 6858197 wrath.
6858520 6859555 She's okay.
6860440 6861634 If you murder a suspect,
6863000 6865275 you throw it all away.<br />He knows that.
6865560 6867391 - She begged for her life.<br />- Shut up.
6867680 6869477 She begged for her life,
6869840 6871751 and for the baby inside her.
6889600 6890715 He didn't know.
6904200 6905838 Give me the gun, David.
6913560 6914390 If you kill him,
6916320 6917355 he will win.
6921640 6922709 Oh, God!
6923440 6924350 Oh, God!
6991520 6992919 We'll take care of him.
7001960 7003313 Whatever he needs.
7004800 7006028 Where are you going to be?
7008920 7009670 Around.
7014280 7015349 I'll be around.
7019920 7021672 Ernest Hemingway once wrote:
7022200 7026113 "The world is a fine place,<br />and worth fighting for".
7027280 7029430 I agree about the second part.
