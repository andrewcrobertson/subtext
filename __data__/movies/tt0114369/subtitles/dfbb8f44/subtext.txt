58102 61147 Neighbors heard them screaming<br />at each other, like, for two hours.
61314 63483 Nothing new. Then they<br />heard the gun go off.
63649 64817 Both barrels.
66152 68237 A crime of passion.
68571 70073 Yeah.
70239 72825 Just look at all the<br />passion on that wall.
72992 75912 Yeah, well, this is a<br />done deal. All but the paperwork.
80208 81542 The kid see it?
81709 83127 What?
83377 84962 The kid.
85213 86839 What kind of fucking<br />question is that?
88216 92470 We are all gonna be real glad when we get<br />rid of you, Somerset, you know that?
92845 95681 There's always these questions<br />with you. Did the kid see it?
95848 98392 Who gives a fuck? He's dead.<br />His wife killed him.
98851 101354 Anything else has nothing<br />to do with us.
109779 111864 Detective Somerset?
113199 114992 I'm Detective Mills.
115159 117578 Lieutenant, I apologize<br />for interrupting like this...
117745 120373 ...just get in town 20 minutes ago,<br />they dump me here.
120540 121958 Look, um...
122291 123501 Mills?
123668 126379 I thought we might<br />find a bar someplace. Sit, talk--
126546 128422 I'd like to get to the precinct.
128589 131676 You know, not much time<br />for this transition thing.
132677 135596 I meant to ask you something,<br />when we spoke on the phone before.
135763 136973 Yeah.
138224 139725 Why here?
139892 141561 I don't follow.
141727 144772 Well, all this effort<br />to get transferred.
145731 148693 It's the first question<br />that popped into my head.
149026 150736 I guess for the same reasons as you.
150903 154115 Or the same reasons you had<br />before you decided to quit, yeah?
155992 158202 You just met me.
158870 161414 Maybe I'm not understanding<br />the question.
162456 164208 It's very simple.
164709 168754 You actually fought<br />to get reassigned here.
169255 171299 I've just never seen it done<br />that way before.
171465 173885 I thought I could do some good.<br />It would be great...
174051 176762 ...if we didn't start out<br />kicking each other in the balls.
179265 181934 If you're calling the shots, lieutenant--<br />Yes.
183060 186314 I want you to look<br />and I want you to listen, okay?
186480 188941 Now, I wasn't standing around<br />guarding the Taco Bell.
189108 191194 I've worked Homicide five years.<br />Not here.
191360 192403 I understand that.
192570 197116 Well, over the next seven days, detective,<br />you'll do me the favor of remembering that.
208878 211631 Hey, hey. I almost died.
235029 237240 Shut the fuck up down there!
421382 423384 Hello? Yeah.
423551 424969 Okay.
425886 427388 Say it again.
429974 433686 I thought we moved here<br />to get away from tractor pulls.
439191 441318 Serpico's gotta go.
441485 445364 Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid<br />of this little crusty.
445531 447158 This eye, Serpico.
447324 448784 Did you get it?<br />Got it.
448951 450286 Good.
466677 468012 Coffee?<br />No?
472475 475561 Nothing's been touched.<br />Everything's like I found it.
475728 477396 What time was death established?
477563 479064 Like I said...
479231 480566 ...I didn't touch anything.
481317 484737 But he's had his face in a plate of<br />spaghetti for about 45 minutes now.
484904 487656 Wait a minute.<br />No one bothers with vital signs?
487823 488991 Did I stutter?
489158 492536 This guy ain't breathing unless he<br />started breathing spaghetti sauce.
492703 495915 So that's how it's done around here?<br />I beg your pardon, detective.
496081 499084 But this guy's been sitting<br />in a pile of his own piss and shit.
499251 501420 If he wasn't dead,<br />he would've stood up by now.
501587 503756 All right, thank you, officer.<br />Okay.
504089 505758 Thank you.
515267 516852 I wonder.
518938 523067 What exactly was the point of the<br />conversation you were about to get into?
523234 524276 Don't know.
524443 528364 How many times has Barney Fife<br />found dead bodies that weren't dead?
529907 531408 Drop it.
556642 557643 Oof.
561272 565359 Somebody phone Guinness.<br />I think we've got a record here.
581750 584128 <i>Better Homes and Gardens.</i>
585671 586672 Oof.
594722 596181 Who said this was murder?
596765 598225 No one.
600019 603522 Guy's heart's gotta be the size<br />of a canned ham.
606191 611989 If this isn't a coronary,<br />well, ha, ha, I don't know.
628714 630841 Whoops.
637181 639350 How about that?
649234 650986 We had this case once.
652112 654031 Guy dead on the ground.
654198 655366 Knife in his back.
655532 657576 Gotta be murder, right?
659370 660412 Fuck.
661246 663791 Anyway,<br />big insurance policy involved, yeah?
663957 668671 So the guy took the tip of the blade,<br />stuck it in his own shoulder blades.
668837 672508 And he must've screwed up a few times<br />because there was multiples back there.
672675 674593 Could you please be quiet?
684103 685145 Wait a minute.
685479 686689 What?
689316 691235 Got a bucket here.
691902 692945 What's in it?
696490 697825 Agh!
697991 699910 Oh, God.
700077 701704 Fucking vomit.
704206 705290 Any blood in it?
705999 708502 I didn't see any.<br />Help yourself.
713632 715634 Are you thinking it's poison?
716802 719179 Oh, wonderful. Very moody.
719346 720973 Thinking it's poison, Somerset?
721140 724601 You girls have got Forensics<br />waiting outside.
724768 728689 Don't know if we'll all fit, though.<br />There's room, light's the problem.
728856 730649 Hi, how are you?<br />Hey.
730816 735112 Detective Mills, would you go help<br />the officers question the neighbors?
737656 740325 What?<br />Send in Forensics on your way out, please.
756175 757968 He's dead.
759052 761013 Thank you, doctor.
766643 770189 You've seen my files, right?<br />You seen the things I've done.
770355 771815 Nope.
774234 776653 I did my time on door-to-doors<br />and walking the beat.
776820 779156 I did that shit for a long time.
779990 781033 And?
781200 784536 Badge on my belt says "detective."<br />That's the same as yours.
785954 788415 Look, I made a decision.
788707 791418 I had to consider<br />the integrity of the scene.
791585 795297 Couldn't worry whether you thought you<br />were getting enough on the playing field.
795464 796840 Hey, man...
798091 801595 ...just don't be jerking me off,<br />that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
808268 809937 He's been dead a long time.
810103 812147 And I can tell you,<br />it was not from poison.
812314 813482 Oh, man.
813649 815818 How does someone<br />let themselves go like that?
816360 819571 It took four orderlies<br />just to get him on the table.
822407 824785 How'd the fat fuck<br />ever fit out his front door?
824952 826954 Please.<br />It's obvious he was a shut-in.
827120 828539 Now, look at this.
828705 830249 See how big this stomach is?
830415 833252 And the strange thing is,<br />it stretches.
833418 836630 Here. Look at the size of the<br />cardiac orifice, where the food--
836797 839883 Wait, I see what you're pointing out,<br />but that means nothing to me.
840050 843512 Okay. He's got lines of distention<br />across the duodenum.
843929 846598 And the interior<br />wall is ripped open.
847099 849268 This man ate till he burst?
849434 851937 He didn't really burst.<br />Not all the way.
852104 854565 He was hemorrhaging internally.
854731 858944 And there was a hematoma in the rectus<br />and transverse abdominis muscles.
859111 860445 So he did die by eating.
860612 862155 Yes and no.
864157 865868 What about these bruises up here?
867786 869538 Well, I haven't<br />figured that out yet.
869913 871582 Gun pressed against his head?
871748 873083 Pressed hard enough, sure.
873250 874710 Fuck,yeah.
874877 877796 Marks from the front side,<br />flush with the muzzle.
879673 883385 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have ourselves a homicide.
886054 888807 Killer put a bucket<br />beneath him, kept on serving.
888974 890350 Took his time, too.
890517 893270 Coroner said this could've gone on<br />more than 12 hours.
893729 896732 Victim's throat was swollen,<br />probably from the effort.
896899 899776 And there was definitely a point<br />when he passed out.
899943 902487 That's when the killer kicked him<br />and he burst.
902654 904615 Oof.<br />Sadistic fucker, huh?
904781 907200 When you want somebody<br />dead, you drive by and shoot.
907367 910412 You don't risk the time<br />it takes to do this.
910579 913373 Unless the act itself has meaning.<br />Come on.
913749 917336 Somebody had a problem with the fat<br />boy and decided to torture him.
917502 918503 Simple as that.
918670 920672 In the grocery bags,<br />we found two receipts.
920839 923175 That means the killer stopped<br />in the middle...
923342 925469 ...and made a second trip<br />to the supermarket.
925636 927012 So?
928096 931350 Hey, man, it's his thing.<br />I've been out in the rain all day.
931516 932893 This is beginning.
933060 935354 We've got one dead guy,<br />not three.
935771 937564 No motive.
937898 941526 Don't even start that big brain of<br />yours cooking on this, all right?
941693 944529 Please, I'd like to be reassigned.
944696 945739 What?<br />What?
945906 948867 What, whoa?<br />What in the hell are you talking about?
949326 951411 This can't be my last duty.
951578 953538 It's just gonna go on<br />and on and on.
953705 954748 You're retiring.
954915 957084 Six more days<br />and you're all the way gone.
957250 959461 Won't be the first time<br />you've left unfinished--
959628 963173 Those other oases were taken as close<br />to conclusion as humanly possible.
963340 964716 And if I may speak freely?
964883 966218 We're all friends here.
966385 969888 This should not be his first assignment.<br />Oh, come on, I knew it.
970055 972182 This is not my first assignment,<br />you dick.
972349 973433 It's too soon for him.
973600 976395 Hey, man, I'm right here.<br />You can say that shit to my face.
976561 978230 Captain--<br />It's too soon for you.
979564 981733 Captain,<br />if we can just talk in private?
981900 983944 This isn't working.<br />It's a personal thing.
984111 985654 Maybe--<br />Just shut up, Mills.
985821 989741 Look, I don't have anyone else<br />to put on this and you know it.
989908 992703 This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.
992869 994496 Give it to me.
994663 996957 Say what?<br />Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.
997124 999251 Sorry, but see you later.<br />Have a nice time.
999418 1002087 Give it to me.<br />No, I'm putting you on something else.
1004631 1006133 Go on, Mills.
1006299 1007884 Just go on.
1013140 1014850 I'm sorry, old buddy.
1015017 1018520 But it looks like you're stuck<br />cleaning up the fat man.
1035454 1037497 All right, here we go. Quiet down.
1038874 1041418 All right, calm down.<br />Calm down.
1041585 1043295 Quiet down.
1043754 1045839 Calm down. Quiet down.
1046006 1048842 Now, here's how it's gonna work.
1049009 1052929 I'll answer questions for 10 minutes<br />and 10 minutes only.
1053096 1056433 If those questions do not come in a<br />calm, sane and orderly fashion...
1056600 1057809 ...I'm on my way out here.
1058018 1059811 Detective?<br />Detective?
1059978 1062355 Can I have a moment of your time?<br />No.
1067194 1070197 I will not discuss the details<br />of this ongoing investigation...
1070363 1071948 ...so don't even bother asking.
1074034 1075869 <i>I've got shopping tools...</i>
1076036 1078246 <i>That's 25 Berlin.</i>
1083293 1085087 That looks like him.
1087047 1089257 <i>Three items for your case number.</i>
1091343 1094262 What you guys got for me?<br />Nothing yet, boss.
1097641 1101394 Why don't you guys, uh,<br />go get a coffee, huh?
1102354 1104356 <i>We have this breaking story for you.</i>
1104523 1106399 <i>We're going to go live downtown...</i>
1106566 1109861 <i>...where defense attorney Eli Gould<br />was found murdered this morning.</i>
1110028 1113698 <i>District Attorney Martin Talbot<br />is taking questions from reporters.</i>
1115534 1117744 <i>There<br />could be a conflict of interest--</i>
1117911 1122040 <i>That is ridiculous to the point of being<br />offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever.</i>
1122207 1123875 <i>And any claim that there could be...</i>
1124042 1126294 <i>...is irresponsible.</i><br /><i>Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.</i>
1126461 1128296 <i>Hold on.</i><br /><i>It's rumored you're far...</i>
1128463 1131133 <i>...from apprehending a suspect.</i><br /><i> I've come from a meeting...</i>
1131299 1133927 <i>...of law enforcement officials<br />and they've assured me...</i>
1134886 1137806 <i>...they have their<br />very best men on this.</i>
1137973 1143145 <i>This will be the very definition<br />of swift justice.</i>
1167043 1168753 Pardon me, George.
1173133 1175719 Somerset.<br />Come in.
1176720 1179431 Have you heard the news?<br />Nope, haven't heard.
1179598 1182392 Eli Gould was found murdered<br />this morning.
1182559 1186313 Someone broke into his law firm<br />and bled him to death.
1186479 1189441 Wrote the word<br />"greed" on the floor.
1194946 1197532 Greed?<br />Yeah, in blood.
1198033 1200076 Mills is heading up<br />the investigation.
1200785 1202537 Uh, excuse me.<br />Excuse me?
1203955 1205624 Could you not do that, please?
1205790 1207167 Oh, okay.
1208293 1210128 Well, good for him.
1210295 1213632 What in the hell are you gonna do<br />with yourself out there, Somerset?
1213798 1215759 Oh, I'll work,<br />maybe on a farm.
1215926 1217135 Fix my house.
1217302 1218970 Don't you feel it?
1219137 1221306 Don't you feel that feeling?
1221473 1224434 You're not gonna be a cop anymore.
1224601 1226645 That's the whole idea.
1228146 1229940 I don't think you're leaving.
1230106 1232651 Hell, you can't leave all this.
1234736 1236571 Guy's out walking his dog.
1236738 1238448 Gets attacked.
1238615 1241326 His watch is taken,<br />his wallet.
1241493 1244913 While he's lying there<br />on the sidewalk, helpless...
1245163 1248375 ...his attacker stabs<br />him in both eyes.
1249626 1252295 This happened just last night<br />about four blocks from here.
1253380 1255340 Yeah, I read about it.
1255507 1259135 I don't understand this place any longer.<br />It's the way it's always been.
1259511 1260512 Maybe you're right.
1260679 1262013 You do this work.
1262180 1265850 You were made for it and I<br />don't think you can deny that.
1266685 1268561 Maybe I'm wrong.
1269396 1273149 Oh, uh, the coroner<br />sent this down for you.
1273483 1277362 Found them in fat boy's stomach,<br />mixed in with food.
1277529 1281449 Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic.<br />Set them on the desk, please.
1285870 1287247 They were, uh...
1287414 1288456 They were fed to him.
1388473 1389766 Oh, Lord.
1397524 1399984 This was found on the wall<br />behind the refrigerator...
1400151 1402320 ...in the obesity murder scene.
1403321 1408118 "Long is the way and hard<br />that out of hell leads up to light."
1408284 1410120 It's from Milton.
1410328 1412205 <i>Paradise Lost.</i>
1412497 1414416 All right, I'm confused.
1414582 1417419 It means that this is beginning.
1418586 1420588 This was found<br />behind the same refrigerator.
1421089 1422882 Written in grease.
1423049 1425760 There are seven deadly sins,<br />captain.
1425927 1427595 Gluttony.
1429889 1431516 Greed.
1433184 1436980 Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...
1438356 1439858 ...and envy.
1440316 1442235 Seven.<br />Hold on.
1442527 1444612 This is not even my desk.
1445738 1447782 You can expect five more of these.
1449576 1450618 Now, wait a minute.
1452203 1454789 I can't get involved in this.
1456666 1458084 Somerset.
1458251 1459961 He wanted it.
1461379 1464257 Damn.<br />I'm all over it.
1465425 1467886 What's wrong with you?
1498082 1499667 Where you headed?
1502587 1504589 Far away from here.
1514015 1516392 Thanks, George.<br />How you doing?
1516559 1518186 Just a few things to look up.
1518353 1520271 Okay. Sit where you'd like.
1521606 1522815 How's everybody?
1524067 1526110 Hi, Smiley.
1526486 1528780 Come on, George,<br />the cards are getting cold.
1528947 1530281 Duty calls.
1546381 1548466 Gentlemen, gentlemen.
1548967 1550009 I'll never understand.
1551636 1553137 All these books...
1553304 1555640 ...a world of knowledge<br />at your fingertips.
1555807 1557392 What do you do?
1557559 1559310 You play poker all night.
1559811 1561646 Hey, we got culture.
1561813 1563815 Yeah, we got culture<br />coming out of our asses.
1566150 1567819 All right.
1567986 1570029 How's this for culture?
1727687 1729480 You know, Smiley...
1730022 1732150 ...you're really gonna miss us.
1733568 1735403 I just might.
1792877 1794879 Fucking Dante.
1795046 1799425 Goddamn poetry-writing faggot<br />piece of shit.
1799592 1801177 Fucker.
1809060 1810394 Yeah?
1811938 1813940 Good work, officer.
1820738 1822907 Thank you, Lord.
1830081 1832333 Oh, I'm sorry.
1833376 1835586 Be out of your way in a second.
1847682 1849851 You want your chair?<br />No. You go ahead.
1850017 1851435 Yeah?
1890016 1891475 Phone.
1891976 1893102 It's a package deal.
1893269 1894312 Comes with the office.
1899525 1900985 Mills.<br /><i>Honey.</i>
1902486 1904739 Are you okay, something wrong?<br />No.
1905197 1909201 You dingleberry, I, uh, told you not<br />to call me here when I'm working.
1910494 1912163 Yeah. Why?
1912330 1913915 Why?
1914582 1917376 Why?<br />Come on.
1920755 1922340 Okay.
1926010 1927011 It's my wife.
1927470 1928554 Sorry?
1930014 1931474 She'd like to speak to you.
1940900 1943277 Uh, this is Detective Somerset.
1943444 1945363 <i>Oh, it's nice to speak with you.</i>
1945529 1948199 Well, it's nice to talk to you too.
1949867 1952203 I appreciate the offer, but--
1954914 1958000 Well, in that case I'd be delighted.<br />Great.
1958167 1961170 Yes, thank you very much.<br /><i>Thank you. See you later.</i>
1961337 1962672 Bye.
1965132 1966175 Hon, what--?
1974558 1975851 Well?
1976018 1978396 Sorry? Oh, uh.<br />What?
1978562 1981107 I've been invited to a late supper<br />at your apartment.
1981273 1982692 I accepted.
1982858 1985236 At my-- How's that?
1985403 1986988 Tonight.
1988447 1990491 <i>Twenty-one-fifty-seven.</i>
1993536 1995538 Hello, men.
1995705 1997873 Hi, loser.<br />Hi, idiot.
1999583 2000876 This is Tracy.
2002003 2004130 Somerset.<br />Hello.
2004296 2007800 I'm very happy to meet you.<br />I've heard a lot about you.
2007967 2009927 Except, of course,<br />your first name.
2011303 2012555 It's William.
2013347 2017018 Hmm, well,<br />it's a good name, William.
2017518 2019437 William,<br />I'd like you to meet David.
2019603 2022148 David, this is William.<br />Okay, all right, I'm gonna--
2022314 2023441 I'll be right back.
2023607 2025735 How are the kids?<br />Good, they're in the room.
2025901 2027361 Come on in.
2028654 2030322 Oh, good dogs.
2030489 2033367 How are you, good dogs?<br />How are you, pretty?
2035369 2037121 How are you?
2038914 2040458 How are you?
2041292 2042710 You are?
2044336 2046297 Smells good.<br />What?
2046464 2047882 Uh.<br />Oh.
2048049 2049675 Yeah.<br />I mean, thank you.
2051177 2054722 Um, please have a seat, if you like.<br />Would you like something to drink?
2054889 2056348 Uh, no. No, thanks.
2056515 2059018 I'll wait.<br />Okay, you can just throw that anywhere.
2059185 2063522 You'll have to excuse all this mess.<br />You know, we're still unpacking.
2065733 2067985 I understand you two<br />were high school sweethearts.
2068152 2069320 Mm-hm.
2070780 2072740 Pretty hokey, huh?
2073532 2075326 You know something?
2075534 2078704 I knew on our first date that this<br />was the guy I was gonna marry.
2078871 2080414 Really?<br />Mm-hm.
2081165 2083918 He was the funniest<br />guy I'd ever met.
2088255 2089298 Really?
2092593 2094929 Well, it's kind of rare<br />nowadays, you know.
2095096 2098849 I mean, that level of commitment.
2103312 2105147 Oh, don't worry.
2105314 2108192 I won't wear it to the dinner table.<br />No, ha, ha.
2108359 2111862 I, uh-- You know, no matter<br />how often I see guns, I just--
2112029 2114990 I can't get used to them.
2115825 2116909 Same here.
2127253 2128879 Why aren't you married, William?
2129046 2131215 Oh, Trace,<br />what the hell?
2131382 2133509 I was close once.
2134176 2135302 It just didn't happen.
2135719 2137763 It surprises me.
2137930 2139932 It really does.
2140933 2142393 Well...
2143227 2147857 Anyone who spends a significant amount<br />of time with me finds me disagreeable.
2148440 2149817 Just ask your husband.
2149984 2151318 Very true.
2151485 2153737 Very, very true.
2154071 2156532 So how long have you lived here?
2156949 2157992 Too long.
2162204 2163289 How are you liking it?
2165166 2169587 You know, takes time,<br />settle in.
2170546 2171964 It'll be good.
2172131 2174258 Well, you get numb after awhile.
2175593 2177094 There are things to any city.
2183559 2184935 Subway.
2185102 2188063 It will go away in a minute.<br />It's nothing.
2190941 2192902 Real estate guy.
2193068 2194403 Fucking piece of...
2194570 2196363 Sorry, honey.<br />He's...
2196530 2198866 He shows us the place<br />a few times.
2199033 2200910 I think he's good.<br />He's efficient.
2201076 2202953 Tracy really likes him.
2203120 2207458 Then I start wondering why will he only<br />bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah?
2207625 2209335 We found out the first night.
2209752 2214757 The soothing, relaxing,<br />vibrating home, huh?
2223015 2224808 I'm sorry.
2231523 2233442 Yeah, all right, laugh it up.
2236862 2238530 I don't know why you're laughing.
2242451 2244536 All right, already.
2248207 2249792 The guy would've had to get in...
2249959 2252503 ...before the office was closed<br />and security tightened.
2252670 2254505 Now, Gould would've<br />been working late.
2254672 2257716 I'm certain. He was the biggest<br />defense lawyer in town.
2257883 2258926 Infamous, really.
2259093 2261303 Now listen, body was found<br />on Tuesday morning.
2261470 2265641 The office was closed on Monday, which<br />means the guy could've gotten in Friday...
2265808 2270062 ...laid low till the cleaning crew left then<br />had his way with Gould all day Saturday...
2270229 2272773 ...Sunday, maybe even Monday.
2273148 2274692 Hey, look at this.
2274858 2277111 Gould was bound,<br />right arm almost free.
2277278 2278779 He was handed a<br />butcher's knife.
2280864 2282574 Check out the scale.
2282741 2283993 A pound of flesh?
2284368 2286120 Yeah.
2297673 2299717 <i>Merchant of Venice.</i><br />Didn't see it.
2299883 2303053 "This task done and<br />he would go free."
2303220 2306390 I'm telling you that chair<br />was soaked through with sweat.
2306557 2308309 Of course.
2308726 2311770 The killer would've wanted Gould<br />to take his time...
2311937 2315441 ...to sit and decide<br />which out to make first.
2315607 2317109 Imagine it.
2317276 2319570 There's a gun in your face.
2319820 2322656 Which part of your body<br />is expendable?
2322823 2324658 What about the love handle?
2324825 2327578 Cut along the side of<br />his own stomach.
2328245 2330748 All right, let's take a<br />fresh look at these.
2330914 2333208 Even though the corpse is there,<br />look through it.
2333375 2335085 Edit out the initial shock.
2335252 2340674 Trick is to find one item,<br />one detail and focus on it...
2340841 2343385 ...until it's an<br />exhausted possibility.
2343552 2345346 Just gonna get another beer.<br />Beer?
2345512 2347723 Uh, wine, please.
2356273 2357775 He's preaching.
2358150 2359735 He's punishing.
2361528 2364865 The sins were used<br />in medieval sermons.
2365282 2367993 There were seven cardinal virtues<br />and seven deadly sins...
2368160 2369453 ...used as teaching tools.
2369620 2372122 Yeah, yeah, yeah,<br />like in, uh, The Parson's Tale and--
2372289 2373791 What's this? Uh, Dante.
2373957 2376168 You read them?<br />Yeah.
2376335 2379421 Well, parts.<br />Hey, remember in, uh, Purgatory?
2379588 2381965 Dante and his buddy,<br />they're climbing up the hill...
2382132 2384301 ...they're checking out<br />all the sinners, yeah?
2384468 2387763 Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation.<br />Yeah, yeah, right.
2387930 2391183 But there, pride comes first,<br />not gluttony.
2391350 2395354 Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider<br />that the books were the killer's inspiration.
2395521 2398982 The sermons<br />were about atonement for sin.
2399233 2401276 These murders are<br />like forced attrition.
2401985 2404029 Forced what?<br />Attrition.
2404196 2406990 It's when you regret your sins,<br />but not because you love God.
2407157 2410202 Oh, like because someone's sticking<br />a fucking gun in your face.
2410369 2411829 Mm-hm.
2414206 2416583 No fingerprints.<br />Nope.
2416750 2420003 Totally unrelated victims.<br />Yup.
2420170 2422631 And no witnesses of any kind.
2422798 2424466 Which I don't get.
2424633 2427886 Because the fucker<br />had to get back out.
2428387 2432975 Well, in any major city, minding<br />your own business is a science.
2433392 2437020 The first thing they teach women in<br />rape prevention is never cry for help.
2437855 2439356 Always yell "Fire."
2439523 2440816 Nobody answers to "Help."
2440983 2442901 You holler "fire,"<br />they come running.
2443318 2444736 That's fucked up.
2444903 2448198 He must've left another<br />puzzle piece.
2449867 2450909 You know what?
2451076 2454371 Thank you for talking this<br />out, but I gotta sleep.
2454746 2458167 Walk the dogs.<br />This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.
2458333 2461044 I'm still leaving at the end of the week.<br />Oh, shit.
2461211 2462838 No, wait, wait.
2464089 2466842 Gould's wife. She was<br />out of town at the time.
2467009 2470220 So this means she saw something.<br />What if it's a threat?
2470387 2473056 Well, I put her in a safe house.<br />She wasn't too happy about it.
2482399 2484860 What if it isn't<br />something she has seen?
2485027 2489114 But something she's supposed to see,<br />but hasn't been given a chance?
2489615 2490991 Yeah, okay. What?
2491450 2493118 I don't know.
2494703 2496997 But that's the one thing.
2542042 2543669 Sign us in.
2543835 2545921 Gotta see Mrs. Gould.
2546421 2548423 treat me like a prisoner.
2548590 2551760 Why do you have a phone if I can't<br />make long distance phone calls?
2551927 2553011 Mrs. Gould?
2553178 2554596 Don't treat people like this.
2559643 2562104 Mrs. Gould, I am sorry.<br />I truly am.
2562896 2564606 I don't understand.
2565315 2569861 Okay, I need you to look at<br />each photo very carefully.
2570028 2574992 Look and see if there's anything<br />strange or out of place.
2575158 2576159 Um, anything at all.
2577202 2579246 I don't see anything.<br />You're sure?
2579413 2581915 Please, I just--<br />I can't do this right now.
2582082 2583709 Okay.
2584167 2585752 It's got to be now.
2585919 2588213 There may be something<br />we haven't seen.
2597055 2598473 Wait.
2598640 2600892 What?<br />Here.
2604271 2607858 This painting, it's upside down.
2615198 2617242 You sure your men didn't move this?<br />No,no.
2617409 2620120 Those shots were taken<br />before forensics.
2623206 2624666 Nothing.
2625584 2628211 There's gotta be something.
2638555 2641391 Moved the screws to rehang it.<br />Yep.
2645562 2647439 What the fuck is that?
2648523 2650275 Switchblade.
2658200 2660118 Goddamn it.
2663205 2666083 There must be something.
2670879 2673382 He didn't paint the fucking thing.
2681014 2684059 No, he's fucking with us,<br />that's what he's doing.
2685102 2687145 See this? This is us.
2687771 2688814 Yeah.
2688980 2690607 Just wait a minute.
2693026 2695153 Now Somerset's climbing<br />on the furniture.
2695320 2697280 Just wait a minute.
2702327 2703995 You're kidding me.
2704454 2706623 Call the Print Lab.
2711545 2713463 Oh, man.
2716341 2720971 Honestly, have you ever<br />seen anything like this?
2722681 2724099 No.
2726143 2728979 I can tell you, guys, just by<br />looking at the swirl pattern...
2729354 2731773 ...they're not the<br />victim's fingerprints.
2741992 2746496 I don't know, man.<br />I say he's whacked enough.
2747789 2748915 It doesn't fit.
2749708 2752461 He doesn't wants us to help him stop.<br />Who knows?
2752627 2756631 So many freaks out there doing their<br />little evil deeds they don't wanna do.
2756798 2759885 "The voices made me do it.<br />My dog made me do it.
2760051 2761845 Jodie Foster told me to do it."
2762012 2765599 You know, um, I've seen this baby take<br />as long as three days to make a match...
2765766 2769269 ...so maybe you guys wanna cross<br />your fingers somewhere else.
2772647 2775358 You meant what you said to<br />Mrs. Gould, didn't you?
2775525 2778737 About catching this guy.<br />Yeah.
2778904 2780030 Hmm.
2780864 2783784 Wish I still thought the way you do.
2784910 2788705 Why don't you tell me what the hell<br />it is you think we're doing then.
2789080 2791333 Picking up the pieces.
2792542 2797339 We're collecting all the evidence,<br />taking all the pictures and samples.
2797506 2799466 Writing everything down.
2799633 2802302 Noting the time things happened.
2803386 2806556 That's all?<br />That's all.
2806723 2810769 Putting everything into neat<br />little piles and filing it away.
2811061 2814898 On the off chance it will ever<br />be needed in the courtroom.
2817192 2820362 Picking up diamonds<br />on a deserted island.
2820529 2824074 Saving them in case we get rescued.
2826910 2828578 Bullshit.
2830455 2834751 Even the most promising clues<br />usually only lead to others.
2835752 2840006 So many corpses roll<br />away unrevenged.
2841967 2846179 Don't try to tell me<br />you didn't get that rush tonight.
2846721 2848598 I saw you.
2849224 2851268 We're getting somewhere.
2866783 2868159 Wake up, Glimmer Twins.
2868660 2870620 You've got a winner.
2876418 2880088 This guy goes by the name of Victor.<br />His real name is Theodore Allen.
2880255 2882924 His prints were found<br />at the scene by Homicide.
2883091 2886553 He's got a long history<br />of serious mental illness.
2886720 2889890 His parents gave him a very strict<br />Southern Baptist upbringing.
2890056 2892726 But somewhere along the line,<br />they fell short.
2893101 2895770 Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,<br />armed robbery and assault.
2895937 2899608 Spent time in prison here a while back<br />for the attempted rape of a minor.
2899774 2902235 But his lawyer saw to it<br />that didn't last long.
2902402 2904988 His lawyer, by the way,<br />is the recently deceased Eli Gould.
2905155 2906740 Greed murder victim.<br />Yes, sir.
2906907 2909659 We're gonna finish this thing<br />up today, ladies and germs.
2909826 2913830 Victor's been out of circulation a while,<br />but there's still a residence in his name.
2913997 2915707 You're not buying all this,<br />are you?
2915874 2919836 Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?<br />You tell me.
2920503 2922505 Our killer seems to<br />have more purpose.
2951534 2952827 You ever take a bullet?
2953370 2956665 Never in my 34 years,<br />knock wood.
2958124 2962170 I've only taken my gun out three times<br />with the intention of using it.
2962337 2963672 Never pulled the trigger.
2963838 2965799 Not once.
2965966 2967050 You?
2967217 2973390 Yeah, but, no, I never took a bullet,<br />but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.
2973556 2975600 Really?<br />It was my first one of these.
2975767 2977978 We were a secondary unit.
2978144 2981231 I was pretty shaky going in.<br />I was a rookie then.
2981398 2984693 Anyway, we bust open the door<br />looking for this junkie and, uh...
2984859 2987237 ...the fucker just<br />opened fire on us.
2987404 2989197 One cop got hit in the arm.
2991241 2993451 Christ, what was his name?
2994786 2996788 Spun him like a top.
2996955 2999040 You know,<br />I mean, more like slow motion.
3000667 3002585 I remember...
3003753 3005088 ...riding in that ambulance.
3005630 3008216 Well, he died right there.
3008758 3010427 Right there.
3010802 3012929 Christ, what was his fucking name?
3025817 3028987 All rise.<br />Let's do it. Let's do it.
3029863 3032407 Go, go, go. Move.
3034701 3036619 Okay.
3055638 3057307 Get up there.
3091049 3094094 SWAT goes before dicks.
3094260 3095720 Hey.
3097013 3099099 They love this.
3099682 3101434 Police.
3102435 3103812 Clear.
3105855 3107524 Clear.<br />Clear.
3107690 3108900 Clear.
3122205 3123706 Clear.
3131589 3133466 Morning, sweetheart.
3134384 3135885 Get up now, motherfucker.
3136052 3137345 Now!
3146396 3148439 Get up, you sack of shit.
3154988 3156739 Oh, fuck me.
3156906 3161077 Dicks, you'll wanna<br />come take a look at this.
3163872 3165498 Dicks!
3171004 3172213 Oof.
3172380 3173423 Jesus.
3173798 3175633 Victor?<br />What the hell?
3175800 3177051 Yeah, it's just Victor.
3177218 3179179 Call an ambulance.<br />What is this?
3179345 3181598 Hearse more like it.<br />Also Forensics.
3181764 3183975 California, get your people out.<br />Go on now.
3184142 3185602 No one touches anything.
3185768 3187937 It's some frigging wax<br />sculpture or something.
3192066 3193276 "Sloth."
3202827 3204078 Oh, man.
3204245 3206039 Goddamn.
3206206 3208917 Those pictures<br />were dated three days ago.
3216883 3219093 This must be the first one. Look.
3220094 3222430 It's dated exactly one<br />year ago today.
3224724 3230480 I got a hair sample, I got a stool<br />sample, I got piss, I got fingernails.
3232523 3236569 He's laughing at us.<br />You got what you deserved.
3239447 3241074 He's alive, he's alive!
3241241 3243034 That cocksucker's alive!<br />Guns down.
3243201 3246162 Still breathing!<br />Guns down! Emergency on that ambulance!
3254003 3255088 Corning through.
3263346 3266432 He's playing games.<br />No shit.
3267225 3270144 Look, we have to divorce ourselves<br />from emotion here.
3270311 3271354 Oh.
3271521 3273523 No matter how hard it is,<br />we have to remain focused.
3273690 3275858 Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.<br />How's that?
3276025 3278820 Are you listening to me?<br />Yes, I can hear you.
3278987 3280613 Excuse me.<br />What are you doing?
3280780 3283366 Closed crime scene, get out.<br />I got a right to be here.
3283533 3284909 UPI photographer.<br />Get out.
3285076 3287829 Hey, I got a fucking right to be here.<br />Get out of here.
3287996 3289914 Get out. Jesus.<br />Fucking jerk. Fuck you.
3290081 3291708 I got your picture, man.<br />Oh, yeah?
3291874 3293334 I got your picture.<br />Yeah?
3293501 3296546 Detective Mills,<br />M-I-L-L-S, fuck off.
3296713 3299007 I'm surprised you can spell.<br />Fuck you.
3299757 3302093 How do they get here<br />so fucking quick?
3302552 3304637 They pay police for<br />the information.
3304804 3305847 And they pay well.
3306723 3308683 Hey, man, I'm sorry, I...
3308850 3310518 Those, ugh...
3310810 3313396 You know, they piss me off.<br />It's okay.
3313563 3316065 It's impressive to see a man<br />feeding off his emotions.
3323031 3325074 A year of<br />immobility seems about right...
3325241 3328161 ...judging by the deterioration<br />of the muscles and the spine.
3328328 3331831 Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord<br />of drugs in his system.
3331998 3333249 Even an antibiotic...
3333416 3337628 ...which must've been administered<br />to keep the bed sores from infecting.
3337795 3341758 Now, has he tried to speak<br />or communicate in any way?
3341924 3344594 Even if his brain were not mush,<br />which it is...
3344761 3347638 ...he chewed off<br />his own tongue long ago.
3349140 3351225 Uh, Doc.
3352018 3355271 ls there absolutely no chance<br />that he might survive?
3355772 3361069 Detective, he'd die of shock right now if<br />you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.
3361235 3364781 He's experienced about as much pain<br />and suffering as anyone I've encountered.
3364947 3366783 Give or take.
3367241 3370244 And he still has hell<br />to look forward to.
3370495 3371537 Good night.
3372955 3375541 <i>Tonight we bring you<br />the Charlie Parker Quintet.</i>
3375708 3378711 <i>Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on<br />piano, Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...</i>
3378878 3383424 <i>...Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,<br />and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.</i>
3383591 3386135 Yeah?<br /><i>Hello, William?</i>
3386302 3390014 <i>It's Tracy.</i><br />Tracy?
3390181 3394519 Is everything all right?<br /><i>Yeah, yes, everything's fine.</i>
3394685 3396354 Where's David?<br /><i>He's just, uh--</i>
3396521 3398898 <i>He's in the other room.<br />He's in the shower.</i>
3399065 3401984 <i>Um, I'm sorry to<br />call you like this.</i>
3402151 3404028 Oh, it's all right. Um...
3404487 3406030 What can I do for you, Tracy?
3407573 3409158 I, uh...
3410118 3411661 Um, heh.
3411828 3413704 I need someone to talk to.
3413871 3417333 Do you think<br />you could meet me somewhere...
3417500 3419001 ...maybe tomorrow morning?
3420169 3422338 I don't understand.
3422964 3426050 <i>I feel stupid calling, but, uh...</i>
3427135 3430513 ...you're the only person<br />that I know here.
3430680 3432014 There's no one else.
3432598 3436644 <i>If you can, just, uh,<br />give me a call, okay?</i>
3436811 3438813 <i>I have to go now.</i>
3439355 3441691 <i>Well, good night.<br />Good night.</i>
3450992 3454829 I mean, you know this city so well.
3454996 3458958 You've been here so long.
3459876 3462211 It can be a hard place.
3462587 3465047 I don't know why I<br />asked you to come.
3466883 3469177 Why don't you talk to him about it?
3469343 3471012 Tell him how you feel.
3472221 3475057 I can't. You know,<br />I can't be a burden.
3475224 3477310 Especially now.
3479061 3481063 I'll get used to things.
3481230 3483191 You know? I think I just...
3483357 3487653 I wanted to talk to someone who's<br />lived here for a long time and...
3487987 3494202 I mean, upstate, you know, it's a<br />completely different environment.
3496871 3499373 Did David tell you<br />that I teach fifth grade?
3499540 3501209 Well, I did.
3502919 3505004 Uh, he mentioned it.
3508049 3511594 I've been going around,<br />you know, looking at schools.
3513429 3517767 But the conditions<br />here are horrible.
3519060 3520102 What about private schools?
3523272 3525233 I don't know.
3526275 3529445 Why don't you tell me<br />what's really bothering you, Tracy.
3531614 3534242 David and I are gonna have a baby.
3538704 3540706 Oh, Tracy, I...
3541832 3543709 I don't think I'm the, heh...
3543876 3546170 I'm the one to talk to about this.
3546337 3548589 I hate this city.
3552385 3554929 I had a relationship once.
3555304 3557306 It was very much like a marriage.
3560268 3562311 We got pregnant.
3563104 3565106 This was a long time ago.
3571028 3574323 I remember getting up one morning<br />and going to work.
3576158 3580871 Just another day like any other, except it<br />was the first day after I knew about...
3581455 3583082 ...the pregnancy.
3584208 3589338 And I felt this fear for<br />the first time ever.
3591424 3595761 I remember thinking how can I bring<br />a child into a world like this?
3595928 3600182 How can--? How can a person grow up<br />with all this around them?
3607690 3610109 I told her I didn't<br />want to have it.
3612111 3613904 And over the next few weeks...
3615323 3617325 ...I wore her down.
3619702 3621954 I wanna have children.
3626375 3628711 I can tell you now that...
3629253 3631380 I'm-- I know, I mean...
3633591 3637511 I'm positive<br />that I made the right decision.
3637678 3639972 But there's not a<br />day that passes...
3640139 3644602 ...that I don't wish<br />that I had made a different choice.
3647730 3650316 If you don't keep...
3651734 3655237 The baby, I mean,<br />if that's your decision...
3657073 3659492 ...don't ever tell him<br />that you were pregnant.
3661202 3664622 But if you choose to<br />have this baby...
3665122 3668668 ...you spoil that kid<br />every chance you get.
3675299 3680137 That's about all the advice<br />I can give you, Tracy.
3687186 3688771 I got to go.
3688938 3690606 William.
3697363 3698531 Thank you.
3712378 3716382 Victor's landlord said there was<br />an envelope of cash in the office mailbox...
3716549 3718634 ...the first of every month.
3723139 3724557 Quote:
3724724 3728185 "I never heard a single complaint<br />from the tenant in Apartment 306.
3728352 3730980 And nobody ever complained about him.<br />Heh.
3731147 3733733 He's the best tenant I've<br />ever had," end quote.
3733899 3735818 Yeah, a landlord's dream.
3735985 3737653 A paralyzed tenant<br />with no tongue.
3737820 3739447 Who pays the rent on time.
3740614 3743492 I'm sick of all this waiting.<br />This is the job.
3744952 3746287 Why aren't we out there, huh?
3746454 3751667 Why do we gotta sit here rotting,<br />waiting till the lunatic does it again?
3751834 3754712 It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.<br />Don't make that mistake.
3754879 3757506 Come on, he's insane.<br />Look.
3757673 3761635 Right now he's probably dancing<br />around in his grandma's panties.
3761802 3764764 Yeah, rubbing himself in<br />peanut butter. Ooh.
3765181 3768058 How's that?<br />I don't think so.
3768934 3771562 His luck will run out.
3772188 3774398 Not depending on luck.
3777276 3781113 We walked into that apartment exactly<br />one year after he tied Victor to the bed.
3781280 3783199 One year to the day.
3783365 3785659 He wanted us to.<br />Don't know that for sure.
3785826 3787578 Oh, yes, we do.
3788370 3790289 This note he left.
3790456 3792166 His first words to us.
3798798 3800007 Fuck him. So what?
3800174 3802051 He's right, so far.
3802218 3806722 Imagine the will it takes<br />to keep a man bound for a full year.
3806889 3810726 To sever his hand<br />and use it to plant fingerprints.
3810893 3813687 To insert tubes into his genitals.
3814104 3818901 This guy is methodical, exacting,<br />and worst of all, patient.
3819276 3821028 He's a nut bag.
3821195 3825449 And just because the fucker's got<br />a library card doesn't make him Yoda.
3829787 3833123 How much money you got?<br />I got like 50. 50 bucks.
3833290 3836252 I propose a field trip. Come on.
3839588 3840589 We'll make a list.
3840756 3843592 At the top we'll put <i>Purgatory,<br />Canterbury Tales.</i>
3843759 3846387 Anything relating<br />to the seven deadly sins.
3846554 3848013 Ask yourself--<br />Hey, wait, wait.
3848180 3850933 What would he study<br />to do the things he's done?
3851100 3853143 What are his interests now?
3853644 3855437 Jack the Ripper, for instance.
3855604 3857314 Where are we going?<br />Library.
3871620 3873497 Coupons, coupons, free coupons.
3873664 3876083 Discount-- Discount coupons.
3877376 3881630 They must've had about 50 health<br />violations during the last inspection.
3881797 3886468 Could you at least sit across from me?<br />I don't want people thinking we're dating.
3886635 3888637 Give me your money.
3889638 3893934 I'm giving you this, but for some reason,<br />I don't think I know what we're doing.
3896478 3897980 Fuck.
3898981 3901025 Hey, Somerset, how you doing?<br />Okay.
3901191 3904653 Didn't figure this was a ménage á trois.<br />It's not a problem.
3904820 3906488 Sit down.
3910826 3914330 Only for you do I do this,<br />so it's a big risk.
3914663 3916999 So I figure we're just<br />fair and square.
3917166 3919376 It's a deal.<br />All right.
3923380 3925090 About an hour.
3926842 3929136 Yeah, help yourself.
3931096 3933432 Well, that was money well spent.
3934350 3935684 Yeah.
3943359 3944652 All right.
3944818 3948030 By telling you this, I'm trusting<br />you more than I trust most people.
3948197 3950991 Well, good,<br />because I'm ready to punch you.
3952743 3956914 It's probably nothing, but even if<br />it is, it's no skin off our teeth.
3959708 3962503 The guy in the pizza parlor<br />is a friend from the Bureau.
3964546 3965631 Who, stinky man?
3966590 3970594 See, for years the FBI's been hooked<br />into the library system, keeping records.
3970761 3975099 Mm-hm. Assessing fines?<br />No, monitoring reading habits.
3975265 3976600 Look.<br />What?
3976767 3978644 Certain books are flagged.
3978811 3983399 Books on, say, nuclear weapons<br />and, well, <i>Mein Kampf.</i>
3983565 3985442 Anyone who checks out<br />a flagged book...
3985609 3988570 ...has his library records fed<br />into the FBI's computers then on.
3988737 3990739 Wait, wait, wait,<br />how is this legal?
3990906 3993742 Oh, legal, illegal.<br />These terms don't apply.
3993909 3995077 Oh.<br />You--
3995244 3999415 You can't use the information directly.<br />It's just a useful guide.
3999581 4002251 It might sound silly,<br />but you can't get a library card...
4002418 4004420 ...without, uh, an ID<br />and a current phone bill, see?
4008257 4010926 So they run a list.<br />Precisely.
4011093 4014471 If you wanna know who's reading<br /><i>Purgatory and Paradise Lost...</i>
4014638 4019643 ...and <i>Helter Skelter,</i><br />the FBI's computers will tell us.
4019810 4021770 It could give us a name.<br />It could.
4021937 4025774 Could get a name of some college kid<br />writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.
4026650 4028777 At least you're out of the office.
4028944 4030654 Get a haircut.
4031613 4033532 How do you know all this?<br />I don't.
4034241 4036827 Neither do you.<br />Exactly.
4044626 4048881 <i>"The Divine Comedy.<br />History of Catholicism."</i>
4049048 4051216 <i>There's a book called<br />Murderers and Madmen.</i>
4051383 4055179 <i>"Modern Homicide Investigation,<br />In Cold Blood.</i>
4055471 4057347 <i>Of Human Bondage."<br />Bondage?</i>
4057514 4059808 Not what you think.<br />Okay.
4059975 4062144 <i>"The Marquis de Sade."</i>
4062311 4064146 It's the Marquis de Sade.<br />Whatever.
4064313 4066690 <i>"The Writings of Saint<br />Thomas Aqua--" Something.</i>
4066857 4069109 Saint Thomas Aquinas.<br />There it is.
4069276 4072112 He wrote about the<br />seven deadly sins.
4072279 4074865 Is that it?<br />Yeah.
4075491 4078327 Let's try it.<br />Jonathan Doe?
4078494 4079578 Whatever.
4079745 4081330 We're sure about that name?
4081497 4082498 Yeah.
4082664 4085209 You saw it, John Doe.
4085375 4087795 You wanna go back, I'll go back.
4087961 4090214 Let's take a look at him.<br />Talk to him.
4090964 4092508 This is crazy.
4092674 4095469 Ah, we'll just talk to him.<br />Uh-huh.
4095636 4099056 "Excuse me, sir. Are you by<br />any chance a serial killer?"
4100432 4102059 Okay.
4102226 4104103 You do the talking.
4104895 4107064 Put that silver tongue of yours to work.<br />No.

4472471 4475891 Mills, you okay?<br />I'm all right.
4478059 4479728 I'm all right.

4485609 4488028 No, no, no.<br />Wait, wait, wait.
4488361 4490030 Wait.<br />What are you talking about?
4490197 4491573 He shot at us.<br />You can't.
4491740 4493533 The hell we can't.<br />We need a warrant.
4493700 4495410 We got probable cause. Come on.
4495577 4496745 Think about it, think.
4496912 4498413 How did we get here?<br />Huh?
4498580 4501791 I can't tell anyone this, I can't tell anyone.<br />Oh, come on, out of the way.
4501958 4503835 We have no reason to be here.
4504002 4505462 Will you listen to me?<br />Get off.
4505629 4507797 Listen to me, listen.<br />Get the fuck off me.
4507964 4509591 All right, all right, I'm sorry.
4509758 4512260 But would you<br />just pay attention a minute?
4512427 4515722 If we leave a hole like this,<br />we won't be able to prosecute.
4515889 4518558 The fucking guy will walk.<br />Now, is that what you want?
4518725 4521520 By the time we clear a warrant,<br />someone else-- No, fuck that.
4521686 4526024 We need a reason to knock on this door.<br />No,no.
4526525 4528318 Think about it.
4529569 4531154 Okay?
4533240 4535283 Okay, man. Okay.
4535450 4537994 You're right.<br />I'm all fucked up.
4538161 4540121 When you're right, you're right.
4548004 4552217 Well, no point in arguing anymore.
4553218 4554803 Unless you can fix that.
4556721 4559849 You stupid son of a...
4567774 4569734 How much money we got left?
4570527 4574239 So, yeah, like, I noticed<br />this guy going out a lot.
4574406 4577325 When the murders was<br />happening, so I, um...
4577492 4579828 So you called Detective<br />Somerset, right?
4579995 4584124 Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective,<br />because this guy was creepy and shit.
4584291 4587002 And one of the murders,<br />it happened right over there.
4587168 4589796 Okay. I told you the rest. You got it?<br />Called the cops.
4589963 4591006 Good?<br />Got your story.
4591172 4592882 Have her sign. You gotta sign.<br />Okay.
4593049 4595302 Okay?<br />Good, good, good.
4595468 4598179 All right.<br />You did good.
4598346 4600640 I did what you said.<br />Here you go.
4600807 4603351 You get something to eat, all right?<br />You eat.
4606438 4608565 Everybody, stay outside.
4669876 4671461 Victor.
4804385 4806721 Somerset!
4807847 4811226 Somerset!<br />Yeah?
4814771 4817315 What?<br />We had him.
4817607 4819275 What are you talking about?
4819442 4822904 The fucking photographer<br />in the fucking stairs.
4827408 4829869 We had him and we let him go.
4836251 4837794 You're sure this is him?
4837961 4839254 Yup, good, good.<br />Yup.
4839420 4841089 Yeah, good, get it out.<br />All right.
4841256 4844425 Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs,<br />no appointment books, no addresses.
4844592 4846427 This is the best, this receipt.<br />Keep looking.
4846594 4848555 Let me show you something.<br />This was under the bed.
4848721 4850682 Uh, his only source of funds.
4850849 4853184 No kidding, we got his money.<br />Fucking A, I like it.
4853351 4854435 One thing.<br />Yes?
4854602 4857564 You're probably not gonna believe this.<br />We haven't found a fingerprint yet.
4857730 4861734 Um, not a single one.<br />You're right, I don't. Keep looking.
4866531 4867991 We could use some<br />more men here.
4868157 4871578 Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.<br />What are you getting with all this?
4871744 4873746 There are 2000 notebooks<br />on these shelves.
4873913 4876791 And each notebook contains<br />about 250 pages.
4876958 4879586 Forget it.<br />Anything about the killings?
4880003 4884215 "What sick ridiculous puppets we are,<br />and what a gross stage we dance on.
4884382 4888303 What fun we have dancing and<br />fucking. Not a care in the world.
4888469 4890138 Not knowing that<br />we are nothing.
4890305 4892557 We are not what was intended."
4892724 4895143 No, wait, there's a lot more.
4896144 4899480 "On the subway today, a man came up<br />to me to start a conversation.
4900023 4904152 He made small talk, a lonely man,<br />talking about the weather and things.
4904319 4906446 I tried to be pleasant<br />and accommodating.
4906613 4909407 But my head began to hurt<br />from his banality.
4909574 4914537 I almost didn't notice it had happened,<br />but I suddenly threw up all over him.
4914829 4919626 He was not pleased.<br />And I couldn't stop laughing."
4920460 4921961 No dates.
4922128 4925465 Placed on the shelves<br />in no discernible order.
4926382 4929469 Just his mind poured<br />out on paper.
4929636 4931012 Looks like a life's work.
4931179 4934557 If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour<br />shifts, it'd still take two months.
4934724 4936476 I know, I know, I know.
4940563 4941814 Where's that phone?
4945193 4946778 Phone? Phone?
4946945 4948029 Phone?
4950949 4952951 People, quiet.
4967882 4970718 Hello?<br /><i>I admire you.</i>
4971552 4975139 <i>I don't know how you found me,<br />but imagine my surprise.</i>
4975890 4979018 <i>I respect you law enforcement<br />agents more every day.</i>
4979185 4982230 Well, I appreciate that,<br />John.
4982397 4984107 I tell you--<br /><i>No, listen, all right?</i>
4984273 4988361 <i>I'll be re-adjusting my schedule<br />in light of today's little setback.</i>
4988528 4990947 <i>I just had to call and<br />express my admiration.</i>
4991114 4993950 <i>Sorry I had to hurt<br />one of you...</i>
4994117 4996744 <i>...but I didn't really<br />have a choice, did I?</i>
4996911 4998621 <i>You will accept<br />my apology, won't you?</i>
4998788 5001207 <i>I feel like saying more, but I<br />don't wanna ruin the surprise.</i>
5006129 5009007 <i>--adjusting my<br />schedule after today's little setback.</i>
5009173 5010508 Got it.
5014929 5016764 All right, everybody,<br />back to work.
5018766 5020184 You were right.<br />Hmm?
5020351 5023938 Ugh, he's preaching.<br />Yeah.
5024564 5026566 These murders are<br />his sermons to us.
5027025 5030278 Look, we know him,<br />we know him, we know him.
5033072 5034824 Who's the blonde?
5038828 5040455 Looks like a pro.
5040621 5042040 Maybe.
5042206 5044542 She caught John Doe's eye.
5049797 5052341 Yeah, he came and<br />collected it last night.
5052508 5054010 Last night?<br />Yeah.
5054177 5055636 This man?<br />Yeah, John Doe.
5055803 5058014 It's an easy name to remember.<br />He had a limp.
5058181 5061809 What was this job you did for him?<br />I've got a picture of it. Hang on.
5061976 5064145 One sweet piece, actually.
5064312 5067648 I thought he was one of them performance<br />artists, that's what I thought.
5067815 5073571 You know, the sort of guy that pisses in<br />a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it.
5073738 5076115 Performance art.<br />Hmm.
5079035 5081204 I think I undercharged<br />him, actually.
5081370 5082622 You made this for him?
5082789 5085500 Yeah, I've made weirder shit<br />than that. So what?
5091422 5093216 They found the blonde.
5096094 5097512 The picture.
5097678 5098888 The picture.
5100515 5101933 Fucking pigs.
5104060 5106854 We need you to move, pal.<br />I'll come out, but you guys--
5107021 5110358 Get the fuck out of the booth.<br />I've been in this cage the whole time.
5110525 5112735 Okay?<br />I'm not fucking with you.
5112902 5114654 Come on, this way.
5121369 5123162 Can you do something<br />about this music?
5123329 5125957 Yeah, we're working on it.<br />We're looking for the guy.
5138678 5140388 You from Homicide?<br />You--
5140555 5142515 You better see this.<br />Yeah. All right.
5144267 5146769 Hey, easy. Got him?
5148896 5151232 Get this thing off of me.
5151607 5153442 Oh, God, get this thing off of me!
5154068 5155653 Get this thing off of me!
5155820 5157822 Get this off!<br />Get him out of here, now.
5157989 5159448 Get him out of here, now!
5160867 5162994 Come on, I wanna hear it again.
5163161 5166414 Tell me again.<br />Just-- I don't know.
5166789 5169917 You heard nothing strange,<br />you saw nothing strange.
5170459 5172086 No.<br />No.
5173796 5175464 He asked me if I was married.
5175631 5178676 And I could see he had a gun in his hand.<br />Where was the girl?
5178885 5181137 The what? What?
5181304 5183764 The girl, the prostitute.<br />Where was she?
5183973 5186434 Someone comes to<br />your establishment.
5186601 5189437 They want to go downstairs<br />and wanna get a little ooh la la.
5189604 5191105 Whatever.
5191272 5194650 They got to come to you, yeah?<br />Yeah.
5194817 5196194 You didn't see anyone?
5197195 5200573 With a package? A knapsack?<br />Something under their arm?
5200740 5204994 Hey, everybody that comes in there's<br />got a package under their arms.
5205161 5208539 Some guys are carrying<br />suitcases full of stuff.
5208706 5211334 She was<br />just sitting on the bed.
5217798 5220134 Who tied her down?<br />You or him?
5220635 5222929 Do you like what you<br />do for a living?
5223221 5226015 These things you see?<br />No.
5227141 5228809 No, I don't.
5230311 5232980 But that's life, isn't it?
5236609 5242323 He had a gun and he<br />made it happen.
5244158 5245868 He made me do it.
5246035 5249538 He put that thing on me.
5249705 5252333 And he made me wear it.
5252500 5256504 Then he told me to fuck her.
5257964 5260174 And I did. I fucked her.
5260967 5262426 Oh, God. Oh, God.
5262593 5264595 Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.
5264762 5268391 The fucking gun was in my throat.
5268975 5270017 <i>Fuck.</i>
5273020 5274605 <i>Oh, God, God.</i>
5274772 5277650 <i>God, help me.<br />Please, please, help me.</i>
5277817 5279527 <i>Please, please, help me.</i>
5296836 5299588 You know, this isn't gonna<br />have a happy ending.
5299755 5303175 It's not possible.<br />Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough.
5305386 5308097 If we catch John Doe<br />and he turns out to be the devil--
5308264 5312059 I mean, if he's Satan himself, that<br />might live up to our expectations...
5312226 5315104 ...but he's not the devil.
5316731 5318232 He's just a man.
5319108 5320735 You know...
5320901 5323738 ...see, you bitch and you complain<br />and you tell me these things. These:
5325531 5329493 If you think you're preparing me<br />for hard times, thank you, but...
5330161 5332830 But you gotta be a hero.
5333622 5336917 You wanna be a champion. Let me<br />tell you, people don't want a champion.
5337084 5339587 They wanna eat cheeseburgers,<br />play lotto and watch TV.
5339754 5341505 How did you get like this?
5342089 5344884 I wanna know.<br />Ah.
5347928 5350431 It wasn't one thing,<br />I can tell you that.
5351974 5353267 Go on.
5356479 5360941 I just don't think I can continue to live in<br />a place that embraces and nurtures apathy...
5361108 5363361 ...as if it was a virtue.
5363944 5365446 You're no different,<br />no better.
5365780 5368407 I didn't say I was different<br />or better. I'm not.
5368574 5371619 Hell, I sympathize.<br />I sympathize completely.
5371786 5374121 Apathy is a solution.
5374288 5378918 I mean, it's easier to lose yourself<br />in drugs than it is to cope with life.
5379085 5381128 Yeah.<br />It's easier to steal what you want...
5381295 5382797 ...than it is to earn it.<br />Yeah.
5382963 5385299 It's easier to beat a child<br />than it is to raise it.
5385466 5388260 Hell, love costs.<br />It takes effort and work.
5388427 5390971 We are talking about<br />people who are mentally ill.
5391138 5393849 We are talking about<br />people, fucking crazies.
5394016 5395476 No. No, we're not.<br />Yes, today.
5395643 5398896 We're talking about<br />everyday life here.
5400272 5402650 You can't afford to<br />be this naive.
5402817 5404402 Fuck off.
5404568 5408823 See, you should listen<br />to yourself. Yeah.
5408989 5412660 You say that the problem<br />with people is that they don't care.
5413661 5415496 So I don't care about people.
5415830 5417373 It makes no sense.<br />You know why?
5417832 5419834 Uh, you care?<br />You wanna know--?
5420000 5422503 Damn right.<br />And you're gonna make a difference?
5422670 5426966 Whatever, the point is, is that I<br />don't think you're quitting...
5427133 5430344 ...because you believe these things<br />you say. I don't.
5430511 5434014 I think you wanna believe them<br />because you're quitting.
5435683 5439103 You want me to agree and say,<br />"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
5439270 5441230 It's all fucked up.<br />It's a fucking mess.
5441397 5444817 We should all go live<br />in a fucking log cabin."
5445443 5447194 But I won't.
5447361 5449488 I won't say that.
5450322 5453742 I don't agree with you.<br />I do not.
5457371 5458914 I can't.
5468340 5470176 I'm gonna go home.
5477892 5479560 Thank you, though.
5509757 5511592 I love you, honey.
5512092 5514220 So much.
5515429 5517431 So much.
5521727 5523479 I know.
5585499 5588002 911, what's your emergency?
5588836 5589878 Could you repeat that?
5590045 5593507 <i>I've gone and done it again.</i>
5603559 5604768 What have we got?
5605102 5607354 Uh, sleeping pills.
5608105 5609690 Glued to one hand.
5609857 5611400 Telephone glued to the other.
5613193 5614361 You see what he did?
5615487 5616864 He sliced her up.
5617489 5618949 Then he bandaged her.
5619533 5621535 Call for help and you'll live.
5621702 5623996 But you'll be disfigured.
5624872 5627916 Or you can put yourself<br />out of your own misery.
5628959 5630044 Come on.
5630377 5631545 Cut off her nose.
5631712 5633380 To spite her face.
5633547 5636216 And he did it very recently.
5643265 5644725 Listen.
5645392 5650397 I've decided to stay on till this is done.<br />I figure one of two things will happen.
5650564 5655194 We'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series<br />of seven and this case will go on for years.
5655361 5658572 Hey man, you don't have to do me<br />any favors. Thank you, but I got it.
5658739 5662076 I'm requesting that you keep me<br />on as your partner for a few more days.
5662242 5664161 You'd be doing me a favor.
5674838 5676382 You knew I'd say yes.
5676548 5678008 Hey, we're here.<br />Wonderful.
5678175 5681637 Your wife called.<br />Get yourself an answering machine.
5683806 5685474 Detective?
5686684 5688936 After this, I'm gone.
5689436 5691939 No big surprise.<br />Detective!
5694942 5696318 You're looking for me.
5696777 5697778 Hey!
5699154 5701615 Don't you fucking move.<br />On the fucking floor.
5701782 5703075 Keep away from him!
5703242 5704952 On the fucking floor.<br />I know you.
5705119 5706495 Now. Get down.
5707204 5709915 Get down on your stomach,<br />you piece of shit.
5710082 5711959 Now. All the way!
5712126 5714294 All the way, fucker! Down!
5714461 5717005 Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker.
5717172 5720426 Now. Nose on the ground.
5723262 5726056 Jesus Christ.<br />What the fuck is this?
5726223 5729393 I'd like to speak to<br />my lawyer, please.
5731145 5733021 Goddamn it.
5734815 5736984 He cuts the skin off<br />the tips of his fingers.
5737151 5741405 That's why we couldn't find one<br />single usable print in his apartment.
5741572 5743907 Looks like he's been doing it<br />for a quite sometime.
5744074 5746493 What about the<br />bank accounts? The guns?
5746660 5748495 So far<br />everything's a dead end.
5748662 5751415 No credit history.<br />No employment records.
5751582 5755335 His bank account's only 5 years old<br />and it was started with cash.
5755502 5757379 We're even trying<br />to trace his furniture.
5757546 5759965 About only thing we know<br />about that guy right now...
5760132 5764970 ...is that he's independently wealthy,<br />well-educated and totally insane.
5765137 5767139 Because he's John Doe<br />by choice.
5767306 5769850 Okay, so when do we get to question him?<br />You don't.
5770017 5771852 He going to court now.<br />What?
5772019 5774480 I'm telling you, there's no<br />way he'd turn himself in.
5774646 5776273 It doesn't make any sense.
5776440 5780027 Well, there he sits.<br />It's not supposed to make any sense.
5780194 5782863 He's not finished.<br />No, he's pissing in our faces.
5783030 5787284 We're just taking it like idiots.<br />You know what I'm talking about.
5787451 5791371 For the first time ever,<br />you and I are in total agreement.
5791622 5795042 He wouldn't just stop.<br />Ugh, so, what the fuck, man?
5795209 5798420 He's two murders away<br />from completing his masterpiece.
5799838 5801924 We'll wait for his plea.
5805052 5809640 My client says there are two more bodies.<br />Two more victims hidden away.
5809807 5812601 He will take Detectives Mills<br />and Somerset to these bodies...
5812768 5816939 ...but only Detective Mills and<br />Somerset, only at 6:00 today.
5817105 5818690 Why us?
5818857 5820317 He says he admires you.
5822069 5823403 It's part of the game.
5823570 5826323 The client claims if the<br />detectives do not accept this...
5826490 5830410 ...these bodies will never be found.<br />Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.
5830577 5831829 Hey.
5831995 5833247 We've got him.
5833413 5835624 Downstairs, locked up.<br />Done deal.
5835791 5838836 He's gonna get his free room and<br />board, get his free cable TV.
5839002 5842464 Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.<br />Why are we having this conversation?
5842631 5845092 Mills.<br />No. Hey, something stinks.
5845259 5846426 And this one here--
5846593 5850264 Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit<br />and that smug smile on your face...
5850430 5853016 ...dealing for that shit, I don't like it--<br />Mills.
5853183 5855435 I am required by law<br />to serve my clients...
5855602 5857354 ...to the best of my ability.<br />Aw, Jesus.
5857521 5860983 To serve their best interest.<br />We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.
5861149 5863569 My client wishes inform you<br />if you do not accept...
5863735 5866363 ...he will plead insanity<br />across the board.
5866530 5868198 Let him try it.
5868365 5869491 I'd like to see him try.
5869658 5872661 Come on, now, we all know the<br />extreme nature of these crimes...
5872828 5875247 ...I could get him off<br />with such a plea.
5875414 5878125 I'm not letting this conviction<br />slide. I can tell you that.
5878292 5881920 He says that if you do accept<br />under his specific conditions...
5882087 5884715 ...he'll sign a full confession,<br />plead guilty right now.
5885090 5887301 It's your case.<br />Make a decision.
5889094 5890721 Full confession.
5890888 5893682 I'm in.<br />It has to be the both of you.
5895142 5900606 If he were to claim insanity,<br />this conversation is admissible.
5900772 5903025 The fact that he's blackmailing us<br />with his plea.
5903191 5905819 And my client would like to<br />remind you two more are dead.
5905986 5907487 Press would have a field day...
5907654 5910616 ...if they find out the police<br />didn't seem concerned about them.
5910782 5913994 Giving them a proper burial.<br />If in fact there are two more dead.
5914161 5918332 Lab report came up from downtown. They<br />did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.
5918498 5922002 They found blood from Doe.<br />From him slicing his fingers.
5922169 5924796 Blood from the woman<br />who's face he cut off.
5924963 5929676 And blood from a third party,<br />as yet unidentified.
5932888 5934973 You'd be escorting an<br />unarmed man.
5938018 5939478 Let's finish it.
5943106 5946109 If John Doe's head splits<br />open and a UFO should fly out...
5946526 5949029 ...I want you to have expected it.
5950697 5952366 I Will.
5954660 5956912 Hey, man, if I was to accidentally<br />shave off a nipple...
5957079 5958705 ...would it be covered<br />by workman's comp?
5958872 5959873 Hmm.
5964086 5966171 I suppose so.
5966880 5968382 Yeah.<br />If you were man enough...
5968548 5972761 ...to actually file a claim,<br />I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.
5973720 5976974 If I keep coming home late, my<br />wife's gonna think something's up.
5986066 5987567 You know...
5988735 5990028 Yeah.
5995867 5997160 What?
6068774 6069983 Let's go.
6100430 6102849 <i>C-Victor -5-5 take. Clear the TC.</i>
6103016 6104267 Pull around.
6105685 6108772 <i>There it is. Late-model black<br />sedan at your 10 o'clock.</i>
6118031 6119199 Who are you, John?
6120283 6122077 Who are you really?
6122369 6123453 What do you mean?
6123620 6127374 At this stage, what harm can it do<br />to tell us a bit about yourself?
6127874 6131044 It doesn't matter who I am.<br />Who I am means absolutely nothing.
6131211 6133130 You need to stay on<br />your left up here.
6137384 6139094 So where are we heading?
6139761 6140804 You'll see.
6141555 6145058 We're not just going to pick up<br />two more dead bodies, are we, John?
6145559 6147435 That wouldn't be shocking enough.
6147602 6150730 We've got newspapers<br />to think about, yeah?
6151815 6154025 Wanting people to listen...
6154192 6157737 ...you can't just tap them<br />on the shoulder anymore.
6157904 6160282 You have to hit them<br />with a sledgehammer.
6160448 6163410 And then you'll notice<br />you've got their strict attention.
6163577 6165453 But the question is:
6165620 6168290 What makes you so special<br />that people should listen?
6168832 6169958 I'm not special.
6171084 6173587 <i>I've never been exceptional.</i>
6173920 6177591 <i>This is, though, what I'm doing.<br />My work.</i>
6178049 6179342 Your work, John?
6179926 6181052 Yes.
6181219 6184181 See, I don't-- I don't see<br />anything special about it, John.
6185599 6186641 That's not true.
6186808 6187893 No, it is true.
6188059 6191229 And the funny thing is,<br />all this work...
6191396 6193398 ...two months from now,<br />no one's gonna care.
6193565 6195901 No one's gonna give a shit,<br />no one's gonna remember.
6196067 6199112 You can't see the whole<br />complete act yet.
6199863 6201448 But when this is done...
6202782 6204117 ...when it's finished...
6205952 6207454 ...it's going to be...
6210457 6213793 People will barely be able<br />to comprehend.
6213960 6216004 But they won't be able to deny.
6217631 6219090 Could the freak be more vague?
6220258 6222510 I mean, as far as master<br />plans go, John--
6222677 6226514 I can't wait for you to see. I really can't.<br />It's really going to be something.
6227599 6230310 Well, you know what?<br />I'm gonna be standing next to you.
6230477 6233730 So when this big thing happens,<br />you be sure and let me know.
6233897 6237400 Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.<br />Oh, don't worry.
6237567 6238610 You won't.
6240612 6242739 You won't miss a thing.
6249329 6252624 <i>With the tour bus<br />itself, give two miles separation.</i>
6269391 6270725 What's so exciting?
6271935 6273853 It's not too far now.
6277565 6279317 <i>High-tension lines ahead.</i>
6279484 6280652 <i>Prepare for<br />frequency change.</i>
6281278 6283571 I've been trying to figure<br />something in my head.
6283738 6286116 And maybe you can help<br />me out, yeah?
6287534 6291705 When a person is insane,<br />as you clearly are...
6291871 6294207 ...do you know that<br />you're insane?
6294374 6296793 Maybe you're sitting around,<br />reading Guns and Ammo...
6296960 6300213 ...masturbating in your own feces,<br />do you just stop and go:
6300380 6303883 "Wow, it is amazing how<br />fucking crazy I really am"?
6304217 6306553 Yeah?<br />Do you guys do that?
6307387 6310056 It's more comfortable<br />for you to label me insane.
6310223 6311433 It's very comfortable.
6312225 6315562 It's not something I would<br />expect you to accept.
6315937 6318732 But I did not choose.<br />I was chosen.
6319149 6322777 Well, whatever.<br />I don't doubt that you believe that, John.
6323320 6327407 But seems to me that you're<br />overlooking a glaring contradiction.
6327574 6328825 Meaning what?
6330035 6331953 Glad you asked.
6333288 6334914 If you were chosen...
6335081 6338918 ...that is, by a higher power...
6339669 6341504 ...and if your hand was forced...
6342088 6345175 ...it seems strange to me that you'd<br />get such enjoyment out of it.
6345842 6348720 You enjoyed torturing<br />those people.
6349429 6352932 This doesn't seem in keeping<br />with martyrdom, does it?
6354100 6355310 John?
6360148 6363026 I doubt I enjoyed it any<br />more than Detective Mills...
6363193 6366905 ...would enjoy time alone with me<br />in a room without windows.
6367489 6369282 Isn't that true?
6369616 6372535 How happy would it make you<br />to hurt me with impunity.
6372702 6373787 That hurts my feelings.
6375372 6378541 I would never--<br />You wouldn't because there's consequences.
6380043 6382670 It's in those eyes<br />of yours, though.
6382837 6385507 Nothing wrong with a man<br />taking pleasure in his work.
6386257 6391179 I won't deny my own personal desire<br />to turn each sin against the sinner.
6392180 6395433 Wait a minute, I thought all you<br />did was kill innocent people.
6397435 6400021 Innocent?<br />Is that supposed to be funny?
6400897 6402357 An obese man.
6402524 6405026 A disgusting man who<br />could barely stand up.
6405193 6409489 If you saw him, you'd point him out to your<br />friends so they'd join you in mocking him.
6409656 6411950 A man, who if you saw him<br />while you were eating...
6412117 6414661 ...you wouldn't be able<br />to finish your meal.
6414953 6418498 And after him, lawyer. You must've<br />secretly been thanking me for that one.
6418998 6421918 This is a man who<br />dedicated his life...
6422085 6426714 ...to making money by lying with<br />every breath that he could muster...
6426881 6429759 ...to keeping murderers and<br />rapists on the streets.
6429926 6431344 Murderers?<br />A woman.
6431511 6433596 Murderers, John, like yourself?<br />A woman...
6433763 6436474 ...so ugly inside that she<br />couldn't bear to go on living...
6436641 6438935 ...if she couldn't be<br />beautiful on the outside?
6439102 6443523 A drug dealer. A drug<br />dealing pederast, actually.
6443690 6446359 And let's not forget<br />the disease-spreading whore.
6448611 6451030 Only in a world this shitty...
6451197 6454909 ...could you try to say these were<br />innocent people and keep a straight face.
6458121 6459998 But that's the point.
6461166 6464210 We see a deadly sin<br />on every street corner...
6464377 6467255 ...in every home and we tolerate it.
6467922 6470675 We tolerate it<br />because it's common, it's...
6470842 6472510 It's trivial.
6472677 6475638 We tolerate it morning,<br />noon and night.
6478725 6480894 Well, not anymore.
6482896 6485273 I'm setting the example.
6486274 6487984 And what I've done is gonna be...
6488151 6489903 ...puzzled over...
6490069 6491905 ...and studied...
6492697 6494407 ...and followed...
6495909 6496951 ...forever.
6497744 6499537 Yeah.
6500413 6502749 Delusions of grandeur.
6503625 6505418 You should be thanking me.
6505919 6507128 Why's that, John?
6507295 6510423 Because you're going<br />to be remembered after this.
6510590 6514427 Realize, detective, the only reason<br />that I'm here right now...
6514594 6516638 ...is that I wanted to be.
6516804 6519307 No. No, we would've<br />got you eventually.
6519474 6520767 Oh, really?
6520934 6525188 So, what were you doing,<br />biding your time? Toying with me?
6525772 6531194 Allowing five innocent people to die<br />until you felt like springing your trap?
6531361 6535448 Tell me, what was the indisputable<br />evidence you were going to use on me...
6535615 6540078 ...right before I walked up to you<br />and put my hands in the air?
6540245 6542455 John, calm down.
6542622 6544999 I seem to remember us<br />knocking on your door.
6545333 6547168 Oh, that's right.
6547335 6550672 And I seem to remember<br />breaking your face.
6555426 6558263 You're only alive because<br />I didn't kill you.
6558429 6560390 Okay, sit back.<br />I spared you.
6560557 6561599 Sit back.
6561766 6564060 Remember that every time<br />you look in the mirror...
6564227 6566938 ...at that face of yours<br />for the rest of your life...
6567105 6568773 ...or should I say for the rest...
6568940 6571317 ...of what life I allow you to have.<br />Sit back.
6571484 6575071 Sit back, you fucking freak.<br />Shut your fucking mouth.
6576698 6579450 You're no messiah.<br />You're a movie of the week.
6579617 6583204 You're a fucking T-shirt at best.
6596301 6598553 Don't ask me to pity<br />those people.
6598720 6600138 I don't mourn them any more...
6600305 6602849 ...than the thousands that died<br />at Sodom and Gomorrah.
6603182 6607645 Is that to say, John, that what you<br />were doing was God's good work?
6610898 6614193 The Lord works in<br />mysterious ways.
6616112 6618239 Do you see those<br />high-tension towers?
6618698 6621034 <i>That's where we're headed.</i><br /><i>I see where.</i>
6621200 6623536 <i>Right to your 9 o'clock</i><br /><i>and follow that access road.</i>
6629876 6632045 <i>Your signal's<br />breaking up, Viking.</i>
6632211 6635673 <i>Un-fucking-avoidable, Center.</i><br /><i>We're in power-line city, deal with it.</i>
6637175 6640011 This sure as shit is no<br />ambush out here.
6640178 6642930 No fucking nothing out here.<br />Can't land anywhere near.
6643097 6645933 They're gonna be coming up<br />behind us in about two minutes.
6646100 6648353 I want you to go up,<br />way up.
6648519 6651648 Thirty seconds, bank east<br />on my mark. Thirty seconds.
6713710 6715461 I'm getting him out.
6717547 6719632 <i>Target is now fully into standby.</i>
6720466 6721467 <i>Got you in sight.</i>
6721634 6723052 <i>Get out.</i>
6723594 6725430 Slowly.
6725722 6727223 Stop.
6727765 6729308 Stay.
6732061 6733771 What do you got?
6734897 6736649 Dead dog.
6737942 6739485 I didn't do that.
6743156 6745324 <i>We're holdin on standby, copy?</i>
6746325 6747410 What time is it?
6748327 6750913 Why?<br />I'd like to know.
6754292 6755376 Seven-oh-one.
6758671 6759756 It's close.
6760840 6762008 Let's go take a look.
6765762 6766804 It's this way.
6769849 6771893 <i>Bird 2, close your distance.</i>
6772059 6774604 <i>This is Bird 2.<br />They're away from the car.</i>
6774771 6776939 <i>Coming in closer.</i>
6778816 6782195 <i>We got them.<br />We got them. Closing in.</i>
6782361 6783988 <i> Negative.<br />Negative. Hold your go.</i>
6809972 6811057 Mills?
6815311 6818356 Down, down, down.
6819357 6820858 Watch him.
6822109 6823945 There he goes.
6824153 6826322 <i>It's good we<br />have some time to talk.</i>
6830409 6831828 <i>Van approaching.</i>
6831994 6835414 Stay on the guy in red. Do not take<br />the crosshairs off the guy in red.
6840044 6842672 <i>He's going out to meet<br />the van. Just stay down.</i>
6843130 6846300 There's a van coming down the road.<br />From the north.
6855476 6858062 Be ready for anything, now.<br />Wait for my signal.
6858229 6859856 Wait for me.
6865278 6867321 Get out of the van!
6868739 6869782 <i>Out!</i>
6869949 6872118 Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.
6872285 6873953 Step away.
6874412 6876622 Turn around.<br />Put your hands on your head.
6876789 6878958 What the hell is going on?
6879125 6881919 <i>What are you doing here?</i><br />I'm delivering a package.
6882086 6883796 I got this package for<br />this guy, David.
6883963 6887258 Uh, Detective David Mills.
6894223 6896559 Get it.<br />Slowly.
6897435 6899979 <i>Stay alert.<br />He's opening the back of the van.</i>
6900146 6901814 <i>We've got him in sight.</i>
6908070 6911324 This guy paid me 500 bucks<br />to bring it out here, man.
6911490 6913576 He said he wanted it here<br />at exactly 7:00.
6914327 6915828 Put it down.
6916454 6917788 We got a box.
6917955 6922251 We got a box. Call the bomb squad.<br />I need a bomb squad. We got a box.
6922710 6924420 Face the van.
6924795 6926255 Hands up.
6933679 6935306 Turn around.
6936182 6938100 Okay. Go.<br />Off you go. Go.
6938267 6940394 <i>Do you want us<br />to pick this guy up?</i>
6941312 6943314 I'm sending the driver<br />out on foot.
6946192 6950154 <i>Got the driver in sight.</i><br />He's headed north. Have him picked up.
6959413 6961332 Oh, I don't know.
6967546 6969048 I'm gonna open it.
6969215 6973094 When I said I admired you,<br />I meant what I said.
6991737 6992822 It's blood.
6992989 6994740 You've made<br />quite a life for yourself.
6994907 6995950 Hmm.
6996117 6999245 You should be very proud.<br />Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
7012925 7014343 <i>Someone lost contact, copy.</i>
7026939 7028399 California,<br />stay away from here.
7028566 7031027 Stay away from here, now.<br />Don't come in here.
7031485 7033195 <i>Whatever you hear,<br />stay away.</i>
7034405 7037491 John Doe has the upper hand.<br />Mills!
7037908 7039035 Here he comes.
7039201 7041078 Throw your gun down!<br />What?
7041245 7043456 I wish I could've lived like you.<br />Shut up.
7043622 7046417 What the fuck you talking about?<br />Go away!
7046584 7047877 Do you hear me, detective?
7048044 7052381 I'm trying to tell you how much<br />I admire you and your pretty wife.
7053466 7055301 What?<br />Tracy.
7055468 7056677 Mills!
7056844 7057928 What'd you fucking say?
7058095 7062183 It's disturbing how easily a member of<br />the press can purchase information...
7062349 7064060 ...from the men in your precinct.
7064560 7066062 What the fuck?
7066479 7068355 <i>Throw your gun down!</i>
7068522 7070566 I visited your home this morning...
7071567 7073360 After you'd left.
7073527 7075654 Mills!<br />I tried to play husband.
7076322 7079575 I tried to taste the<br />life of a simple man.
7079784 7081035 Throw it away!
7081202 7083496 Tsk, it didn't work out.
7083662 7085331 So...
7085498 7087416 I took a souvenir.
7089043 7090753 Her pretty head.
7090920 7092505 Mills.
7093047 7094673 Mills.
7095674 7096842 What's he talking about?
7097009 7099386 Give me your gun.<br />What's going on over there?
7099553 7100846 Put the, ugh--<br />Put the gun down.
7101013 7103015 I saw you with a box.<br />What was in the box?
7103182 7106102 Because I envy your normal life.<br />Put the gun down, David.
7106268 7109230 It seems that envy is my sin.<br />Oh, what's in the box?
7109396 7111732 Not until you give me the gun.<br />What's in the box?
7111899 7113651 Give me the gun.<br />He just told you.
7113818 7117446 You lie. You're a fucking liar, shut up.<br />David.
7117613 7120366 That's what he wants.<br />He wants you to shoot him.
7120533 7123661 No! No.
7124036 7125830 You tell me that's not true.
7125996 7128124 That's not true.<br />Become vengeance, David.
7128290 7131168 Oh, she's all right. You tell me.<br />Become...
7131335 7133838 ...wrath.<br />Tell me she's all right!
7134004 7136132 If you murder a suspect, David--<br />No.
7136298 7138050 You throw<br />it all away, he knows it.
7138217 7139218 No!
7139385 7141387 She begged for her life.<br />Shut up.
7141554 7145224 She begged for her life and for<br />the life of the baby inside of her.
7161282 7162658 Oh.
7164577 7165786 He didn't know.
7179758 7181719 Give me the gun, David.
7186682 7188184 David.
7189476 7190895 If you kill him...
7192396 7194148 ...he will win.
7197860 7199695 Oh, God.
7199862 7202072 Oh, God.
7202781 7203949 Oh!
7217379 7219131 Oh, fuck, he shot him.
7241237 7243822 <i>Set it down somewhere.</i>
7245032 7247326 <i>Come on, set us down.</i>
7249745 7253540 <i>Holy Christ.<br />Somebody call somebody.</i>
7253707 7255542 <i>Call somebody.</i>
7270015 7273060 Well, we'll take care of him.
7281735 7283779 Whatever he needs.
7284697 7286198 Where are you gonna be?
7288909 7290286 Around.
7294623 7296542 I'll be around.
7300421 7302673 <i>Ernest Hemingway once wrote:</i>
7302840 7307261 <i>"The world is a fine place<br />and worth fighting for."</i>
7308095 7310681 <i>I agree with the second part.</i>
