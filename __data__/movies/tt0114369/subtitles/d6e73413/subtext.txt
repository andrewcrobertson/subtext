60102 63147 Neighbors heard them screaming<br />at each other, like, for two hours.
63314 65483 Nothing new.<br />Then they heard the gun go off.
65650 66817 Both barrels.
68152 70238 A crime of passion.
70571 72073 Yeah.
72240 74825 Just look at all the passion on that wall.
74992 77912 Yeah, well, this is a done deal.<br />All but the paperwork.
82208 83542 The kid see it?
83709 85127 What?
85378 86963 The kid.
87213 88839 What kind of fucking question is that?
90216 94470 We are all gonna be real glad when we<br />get rid of you, Somerset, you know that?
94845 97682 There's always these questions with you.<br />Did the kid see it?
97848 100393 Who gives a fuck? He's dead.<br />His wife killed him.
100851 103354 Anything else has nothing to do with us.
111779 113864 Detective Somerset?
115199 116993 I'm Detective Mills.
117159 119578 Lieutenant, I apologize<br />for interrupting like this...
119745 122373 just get in town 20 minutes ago,<br />they dump me here.
122540 123958 Look, um...
124292 125501 Mills?
125668 128379 I thought we might<br />find a bar some place. Sit, talk...
128546 130423 I'd like to get to the precinct.
130589 133676 You know,<br />not much time for this transition thing.
134677 137596 I meant to ask you something,<br />when we spoke on the phone before.
137763 138973 Yeah.
140224 141726 Why here?
141892 143561 I don't follow.
143728 146772 Well, all this effort to get transferred.
147732 150693 It's the first question<br />that popped into my head.
151027 152737 I guess for the same reasons as you.
152903 156115 Or the same reasons you had<br />before you decided to quit, yeah?
157992 160202 You just met me.
160870 163414 Maybe I'm not understanding<br />the question.
164457 166208 It's very simple.
166709 170755 You actually fought<br />to get reassigned here.
171255 173299 I've just never seen it done<br />that way before.
173466 175885 I thought I could do some good.<br />It would be great...
176052 178763 if we didn't start out<br />kicking each other in the balls.
181265 183934 - If you're calling the shots, lieutenant...<br />- Yes.
185061 188314 I want you to look<br />and I want you to listen, okay?
188481 190941 Now, I wasn't standing around<br />guarding the Taco Bell.
191108 193194 - I've worked Homicide five years.<br />- Not here.
193361 194403 I understand that.
194570 199116 Well, over the next seven days, detective,<br />you'll do me the favor of remembering that.
210878 213631 Hey, hey. I almost died.
237029 239240 Shut the fuck up down there!
423382 425384 Hello? Yeah.
425551 426969 Okay.
427886 429388 Say it again.
431974 435686 I thought we moved here<br />to get away from tractor pulls.
441191 443319 Serpico's gotta go.
443485 447364 Yeah, well, you might wanna get rid<br />of this little crusty.
447531 449158 This eye, Serpico.
449325 450784 - Did you get it?<br />- Got it.
450951 452286 Good.
468677 470012 Coffee? No?
474475 477561 Nothing's been touched.<br />Everything's like I found it.
477728 479396 What time was death established?
479563 481065 Like I said...
481231 482566 didn't touch anything.
483317 486737 But he's had his face in a plate of<br />spaghetti for about 45 minutes now.
486904 489657 Wait a minute.<br />No one bothers with vital signs?
489823 490991 Did I stutter?
491158 494536 This guy ain't breathing unless he<br />started breathing spaghetti sauce.
494703 497915 So that's how it's done around here?<br />I beg your pardon, detective.
498082 501085 But this guy's been sitting<br />in a pile of his own piss and shit.
501251 503420 If he wasn't dead,<br />he would've stood up by now.
503587 505756 - All right, thank you, officer.<br />- Okay.
506090 507758 Thank you.
517267 518852 I wonder.
520938 525067 What exactly was the point of the<br />conversation you were about to get into?
525234 526276 Don't know.
526443 530364 How many times has Barney Fife<br />found dead bodies that weren't dead?
531907 533409 Drop it.
558642 559643 Oof.
563272 567359 Somebody phone Guinness.<br />I think we've got a record here.
583751 586128 Better Homes and Gardens.
587671 588672 Oof.
596722 598182 Who said this was murder?
598766 600225 No one.
602019 605522 Guy's heart's gotta be the size<br />of a canned ham.
608192 613989 If this isn't a coronary,<br />well, ha, ha, I don't know.
630714 632841 Whoops.
639181 641350 How about that?
651235 652986 We had this case once.
654112 656031 Guy dead on the ground.
656198 657366 Knife in his back.
657533 659576 Gotta be murder, right?
661370 662412 Fuck.
663247 665791 Anyway,<br />big insurance policy involved, yeah?
665958 670671 So the guy took the tip of the blade,<br />stuck it in his own shoulder blades.
670838 674508 And he must've screwed up a few times<br />because there was multiples back there.
674675 676593 Could you please be quiet?
686103 687145 Wait a minute.
687479 688689 What?
691316 693235 Got a bucket here.
693902 694945 What's in it?
698490 699825 Agh!
699992 701910 Oh, God.
702077 703704 Fucking vomit.
706206 707291 Any blood in it?
708000 710502 I didn't see any. Help yourself.
715632 717634 Are you thinking it's poison?
718802 721179 Oh, wonderful. Very moody.
721346 722973 Thinking it's poison, Somerset?
723140 726602 You girls have got Forensics<br />waiting outside.
726768 730689 - Don't know if we'll all fit, though.<br />- There's room, light's the problem.
730856 732649 - Hi, how are you?<br />- Hey.
732816 737112 Detective Mills, would you go help<br />the officers question the neighbors?
739656 742326 - What?<br />- Send in Forensics on your way out, please.
758175 759968 He's dead.
761053 763013 Thank you, doctor.
768644 772189 You've seen my files, right?<br />You seen the things I've done.
772356 773815 Nope.
776234 778654 I did my time on door-to-doors<br />and walking the beat.
778820 781156 I did that shit for a long time.
781990 783033 And?
783200 786536 Badge on my belt says "detective."<br />That's the same as yours.
787955 790415 Look, I made a decision.
790707 793418 I had to consider<br />the integrity of the scene.
793585 797297 Couldn't worry whether you thought you<br />were getting enough on the playing field.
797464 798840 Hey, man...
800092 803595 just don't be jerking me off,<br />that's all I ask. Don't jerk me off.
810268 811937 He's been dead a long time.
812104 814147 And I can tell you,<br />it was not from poison.
814314 815482 Oh, man.
815649 817818 How does someone<br />let themselves go like that?
818360 821571 It took four orderlies<br />just to get him on the table.
824408 826785 How'd the fat fuck<br />ever fit out his front door?
826952 828954 Please. It's obvious he was a shut-in.
829121 830539 Now, look at this.
830706 832249 See how big this stomach is?
832416 835252 And the strange thing is, it stretches.
835419 838630 Here. Look at the size of the<br />cardiac orifice, where the food...
838797 841883 Wait, I see what you're pointing out,<br />but that means nothing to me.
842050 845512 Okay. He's got lines of distention<br />across the duodenum.
845929 848598 And the interior wall is ripped open.
849099 851268 This man ate till he burst?
851435 853937 He didn't really burst. Not all the way.
854104 856565 He was hemorrhaging internally.
856732 860944 And there was a hematoma in the rectus<br />and transverse abdominis muscles.
861111 862446 So he did die by eating.
862612 864156 Yes and no.
866158 867868 What about these bruises up here?
869786 871538 Well, I haven't figured that out yet.
871913 873582 Gun pressed against his head?
873749 875083 Pressed hard enough, sure.
875250 876710 Fuck, yeah.
876877 879796 Marks from the front side,<br />flush with the muzzle.
881673 885385 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />we have ourselves a homicide.
888055 890807 Killer put a bucket beneath him,<br />kept on serving.
890974 892350 Took his time, too.
892517 895270 Coroner said this could've gone on<br />more than 12 hours.
895729 898732 Victim's throat was swollen,<br />probably from the effort.
898899 901777 And there was definitely a point<br />when he passed out.
901943 904488 That's when the killer kicked him<br />and he burst.
904654 906615 Oof. Sadistic fucker, huh?
906782 909201 When you want somebody<br />dead, you drive by and shoot.
909367 912412 You don't risk the time it takes<br />to do this.
912579 915373 -Unless the act itself has meaning.<br />Come on.
915749 919336 Somebody had a problem with the fat boy<br />and decided to torture him.
919503 920504 Simple as that.
920670 922672 In the grocery bags,<br />we found two receipts.
922839 925175 That means the killer stopped<br />in the middle...
925342 927469 and made a second trip<br />to the supermarket.
927636 929012 So?
930097 933350 Hey, man, it's his thing.<br />I've been out in the rain all day.
933517 934893 This is beginning.
935060 937354 We've got one dead guy, not three.
937771 939564 No motive.
939898 943527 Don't even start that big brain of yours<br />cooking on this, all right?
943693 946530 Please, I'd like to be reassigned.
946696 947739 What?<br />What?
947906 950867 - What, whoa?<br />- What in the hell are you talking about?
951326 953411 This can't be my last duty.
953578 955539 It's just gonna go on and on and on.
955705 956748 You're retiring.
956915 959084 Six more days<br />and you're all the way gone.
959251 961461 Won't be the first time<br />you've left unfinished...
961628 965173 Those other cases were taken<br />as close to conclusion as humanly possible.
965340 966716 And if I may speak freely?
966883 968218 We're all friends here.
968385 971888 - This should not be his first assignment.<br />- Oh, come on, I knew it.
972055 974182 This is not my first assignment, you dick.
974349 975433 It's too soon for him.
975600 978395 Hey, man, I'm right here.<br />You can say that shit to my face.
978562 980230 - Captain...<br />- It's too soon for you.
981565 983733 Captain, if we can just talk in private?
983900 985944 This isn't working. It's a personal thing.
986111 987654 - Maybe...<br />- Just shut up, Mills.
987821 991741 Look, I don't have anyone else<br />to put on this and you know it.
991908 994703 This is Metro. You don't just get to swap.
994870 996496 Give it to me.
996663 998957 - Say what?<br />- Yeah, he doesn't want it, fuck him.
999124 1001251 Sorry, but see you later. Have a nice time.
1001418 1004087 - Give it to me.<br />- No, I'm putting you on something else.
1006631 1008133 Go on, Mills.
1008300 1009885 Just go on.
1015140 1016850 I'm sorry, old buddy.
1017017 1020520 But it looks like you're stuck<br />cleaning up the fat man.
1037454 1039497 All right, here we go. Quiet down.
1040874 1043418 All right, calm down. Calm down.
1043585 1045295 Quiet down.
1045754 1047839 Calm down. Quiet down.
1048006 1050842 Now, here's how it's gonna work.
1051009 1054930 I'll answer questions for 10 minutes<br />and 10 minutes only.
1055096 1058433 If those questions do not come in a calm,<br />sane and orderly fashion...
1058600 1059809 I'm on my way out here.
1060018 1061811 Detective? Detective?
1061978 1064356 - Can I have a moment of your time?<br />- No.
1069194 1072197 I will not discuss the details<br />of this ongoing investigation...
1072364 1073949 So don't even bother asking.
1076034 1077869 I've got shopping tools...
1078036 1080247 That's 25 Berlin.
1085293 1087087 That looks like him.
1089047 1091258 Three items for your case number.
1093343 1096263 -What you guys got for me?<br />Nothing yet, boss.
1099641 1103395 Why don't you guys, uh,<br />go get a coffee, huh?
1104354 1106356 We have this breaking story for you.
1106523 1108400 We're going to go live downtown...
1108566 1111861 where defense attorney Eli Gould<br />was found murdered this morning.
1112028 1115699 District Attorney Martin Talbot<br />is taking questions from reporters.
1117534 1119744 There could be a conflict of interest...
1119911 1124040 That is ridiculous to the point of being<br />offensive. There is no conflict whatsoever.
1124207 1125875 And any claim that there could be...
1126042 1128295 Is irresponsible.<br />REPORTER 2. Mr. Talbot, Mr. Talbot.
1128461 1130297 -Hold on.<br />It's rumored you're far...
1130463 1133133 from apprehending a suspect.<br />I've come from a meeting...
1133300 1135927 of law enforcement officials<br />and they've assured me...
1136886 1139806 they have their very best men on this.
1139973 1145145 This will be the very definition<br />of swift justice.
1169044 1170754 Pardon me, George.
1175133 1177719 - Somerset.<br />- Come in.
1178720 1181431 -Have you heard the news?<br />Nope, haven't heard.
1181598 1184392 Eli Gould was found murdered<br />this morning.
1184559 1188313 Someone broke into his law firm<br />and bled him to death.
1188480 1191441 Wrote the word "greed" ” on the floor.
1196946 1199532 -Greed?<br />Yeah, in blood.
1200033 1202077 Mills is heading up the investigation.
1202786 1204537 Uh, excuse me. Excuse me?
1205955 1207624 Could you not do that, please?
1207791 1209167 Oh, okay.
1210293 1212128 Well, good for him.
1212295 1215632 What in the hell are you gonna do<br />with yourself out there, Somerset?
1215799 1217759 Oh, I'll work, maybe on a farm.
1217926 1219135 Fix my house.
1219302 1220970 Don't you feel it?
1221137 1223306 Don't you feel that feeling?
1223473 1226434 You're not gonna be a cop anymore.
1226601 1228645 That's the whole idea.
1230146 1231940 I don't think you're leaving.
1232107 1234651 Hell, you can't leave all this.
1236736 1238571 Guy's out walking his dog.
1238738 1240448 Gets attacked.
1240615 1243326 His watch is taken, his wallet.
1243493 1246913 While he's lying there<br />on the sidewalk, helpless...
1247163 1250375 his attacker stabs him in both eyes.
1251626 1254295 This happened just last night<br />about four blocks from here.
1255380 1257340 Yeah, I read about it.
1257507 1261136 - I don't understand this place any longer.<br />- It's the way it's always been.
1261511 1262512 Maybe you're right.
1262679 1264013 You do this work.
1264180 1267851 You were made for it<br />and I don't think you can deny that.
1268685 1270562 Maybe I'm wrong.
1271396 1275150 Oh, uh, the coroner<br />sent this down for you.
1275483 1279362 Found them in fat boy's stomach,<br />mixed in with food.
1279529 1283450 - Looks like plastic, little pieces of plastic.<br />- Set them on the desk, please.
1287871 1289247 They were, uh...
1289414 1290457 They were fed to him.
1390473 1391766 Oh, Lord.
1399524 1401985 This was found on the wall<br />behind the refrigerator...
1402151 1404320 in the obesity murder scene.
1405321 1410118 "Long is the way and hard<br />that out of hell leads up to light."
1410285 1412120 It's from Milton.
1412328 1414205 Paradise Lost.
1414497 1416416 All right, I'm confused.
1416583 1419419 It means that this is beginning.
1420587 1422589 This was found<br />behind the same refrigerator.
1423089 1424882 Written in grease.
1425049 1427760 There are seven deadly sins, captain.
1427927 1429596 Gluttony.
1431889 1433516 Greed.
1435184 1438980 Sloth, wrath, pride, lust...
1440356 1441858 and envy.
1442317 1444235 - Seven.<br />- Hold on.
1444527 1446613 This is not even my desk.
1447739 1449782 You can expect five more of these.
1451576 1452619 Now, wait a minute.
1454203 1456789 I can't get involved in this.
1458666 1460084 Somerset.
1460251 1461961 He wanted it.
1463379 1466257 - Damn.<br />- I'm all over it.
1467425 1469886 What's wrong with you?
1500083 1501668 Where you headed?
1504587 1506589 Far away from here.
1516015 1518393 Thanks, George.<br />How you doing?
1518559 1520186 Just a few things to look up.
1520353 1522271 Okay. Sit where you'd like.
1523606 1524816 How's everybody?
1526067 1528111 Hi, Smiley.
1528486 1530780 Come on, George,<br />the cards are getting cold.
1530947 1532281 Duty calls.
1548381 1550466 Gentlemen, gentlemen.
1550967 1552009 I'll never understand.
1553636 1555138 All these books...
1555304 1557640 a world of knowledge<br />at your fingertips.
1557807 1559392 What do you do?
1559559 1561310 You play poker all night.
1561811 1563646 Hey, we got culture.
1563813 1565815 Yeah, we got culture<br />coming out of our asses.
1568151 1569819 Al right.
1569986 1572029 How's this for culture?
1729687 1731480 You know, Smiley...
1732023 1734150 you're really gonna miss us.
1735568 1737403 I just might.
1794877 1796879 Fucking Dante.
1797046 1801425 Goddamn poetry-writing faggot<br />piece of shit.
1801592 1803177 Fucker.
1811060 1812395 Yeah?
1813938 1815940 Good work, officer.
1822738 1824907 Thank you, Lord.
1832081 1834333 Oh, I'm sorry.
1835376 1837586 Be out of your way in a second.
1849682 1851851 - You want your chair?<br />- No. You go ahead.
1852018 1853436 Yeah?
1892016 1893476 Phone.
1893976 1895102 It's a package deal.
1895269 1896312 Comes with the office.
1901525 1902985 -Mills.<br />Honey.
1904487 1906739 - Are you okay, something wrong?<br />- No.
1907198 1911202 You dingleberry, I, uh, told you<br />not to call me here when I'm working.
1912495 1914163 Yeah. Why?
1914330 1915915 Why?
1916582 1919376 - Why?<br />- Come on.
1922755 1924340 Okay.
1928010 1929011 It's my wife.
1929470 1930554 Sorry?
1932014 1933474 She'd like to speak to you.
1942900 1945277 Uh, this is Detective Somerset.
1945444 1947363 Oh, it's nice to speak with you.
1947530 1950199 Well, it's nice to talk to you too.
1951867 1954203 I appreciate the offer, but...
1956914 1960000 - Well, in that case I'd be delighted.<br />- Great.
1960167 1963170 - Yes, thank you very much.<br />- Thank you. See you later.
1963337 1964672 Bye.
1967133 1968175 Hon, what...?
1976559 1977852 Well?
1978018 1980396 - Sorry? Oh, uh.<br />- What?
1980563 1983107 I've been invited to a late supper<br />at your apartment.
1983274 1984692 I accepted.
1984859 1987236 At my... How's that?
1987403 1988988 Tonight.
1990447 1992491 Twenty-one-fifty-seven.
1995536 1997538 Hello, men.
1997705 1999874 - Hi, loser.<br />- Hi, idiot.
2001584 2002877 This is Tracy.
2004003 2006130 - Somerset.<br />- Hello.
2006297 2009800 I'm very happy to meet you.<br />I've heard a lot about you.
2009967 2011927 Except, of course, your first name.
2013304 2014555 It's William.
2015347 2019018 Hmm, well, it's a good name, William.
2019518 2021437 William, I'd like you to meet David.
2021604 2024148 - David, this is William.<br />- Okay, all right, I'm gonna...
2024315 2025441 I'll be right back.
2025608 2027735 - How are the kids?<br />- Good, they're in the room.
2027902 2029361 Come on in.
2030654 2032323 Oh, good dogs.
2032489 2035367 How are you, good dogs?<br />How are you, pretty?
2037369 2039121 How are you?
2040915 2042458 How are you?
2043292 2044710 You are?
2046337 2048297 Smells good.<br />- What?
2048464 2049882 -Uh.
2050049 2051675 Yeah. I mean, thank you.
2053177 2056722 Um, please have a seat, if you like.<br />Would you like something to drink?
2056889 2058349 Uh, no. No, thanks.
2058515 2061018 - I'll wait.<br />- Okay, you can just throw that anywhere.
2061185 2065522 You'll have to excuse all this mess.<br />You know, we're still unpacking.
2067733 2069985 I understand you two<br />were high school sweethearts.
2070152 2071320 Mm-hm.
2072780 2074740 Pretty hokey, huh?
2075532 2077326 You know something?
2077534 2080704 I knew on our first date<br />that this was the guy I was gonna marry.
2080871 2082414 - Really?<br />- Mm-hm.
2083165 2085918 He was the funniest guy I'd ever met.
2090256 2091298 Really?
2094593 2096929 Well, it's kind of rare nowadays,<br />you know.
2097096 2100849 I mean, that level of commitment.
2105312 2107147 Oh, don't worry.
2107314 2110192 - I won't wear it to the dinner table.<br />- No, ha, ha.
2110359 2113862 I, uh... You know, no matter how<br />often I see guns, I just...
2114029 2116991 I can't get used to them.
2117825 2118909 Same here.
2129253 2130879 Why aren't you married, William?
2131046 2133215 Oh, Trace, what the hell?
2133382 2135509 I was close once.
2136176 2137303 It just didn't happen.
2137720 2139763 It surprises me.
2139930 2141932 It really does.
2142933 2144393 Well...
2145227 2149857 Anyone who spends a significant amount<br />of time with me finds me disagreeable.
2150441 2151817 Just ask your husband.
2151984 2153319 Very true.
2153485 2155738 Very, very true.
2156071 2158532 So how long have you lived here?
2158949 2159992 Too long.
2164204 2165289 How are you liking it?
2167166 2171587 You know, takes time, settle in.
2172546 2173964 It'll be good.
2174131 2176258 Well, you get numb after awhile.
2177593 2179094 There are things to any city.
2185559 2186935 Subway.
2187102 2190064 - It will go away in a minute.<br />- It's nothing.
2192941 2194902 Real estate guy.
2195069 2196403 Fucking piece of...
2196570 2198364 Sorry, honey. He's...
2198530 2200866 He shows us the place a few times.
2201033 2202910 I think he's good. He's efficient.
2203077 2204953 Tracy really likes him.
2205120 2209458 Then I start wondering why will he only<br />bring us here five minutes at a time, yeah?
2209625 2211335 We found out the first night.
2211752 2216757 The soothing, relaxing,<br />vibrating home, huh?
2225015 2226809 I'm sorry.
2233524 2235442 Yeah, all right, laugh it up.
2238862 2240531 I don't know why you're laughing.
2244451 2246537 All right, already.
2250207 2251792 The guy would've had to get in...
2251959 2254503 before the office was closed<br />and security tightened.
2254670 2256505 Now, Gould would've been working late.
2256672 2259716 I'm certain. He was the biggest<br />defense lawyer in town.
2259883 2260926 Infamous, really.
2261093 2263303 Now listen,<br />body was found on Tuesday morning.
2263470 2267641 The office was closed on Monday, which<br />means the guy could've gotten in Friday...
2267808 2272062 laid low till the cleaning crew left then<br />had his way with Gould all day Saturday...
2272229 2274773 Sunday, maybe even Monday.
2275149 2276692 Hey, look at this.
2276859 2279111 Gould was bound, right arm almost free.
2279278 2280779 He was handed a butcher's knife.
2282865 2284575 Check out the scale.
2284741 2285993 A pound of flesh?
2286368 2288120 Yeah.
2299673 2301717 - Merchant of Venice.<br />- Didn't see it.
2301884 2305053 "This task done and he would go free."
2305220 2308390 I'm telling you that chair<br />was soaked through with sweat.
2308557 2310309 Of course.
2310726 2313770 The killer would've wanted Gould<br />to take his time...
2313937 2317441 to sit and decide<br />which cut to make first.
2317608 2319109 Imagine it.
2319276 2321570 There's a gun in your face.
2321820 2324656 Which part of your body is expendable?
2324823 2326658 What about the love handle?
2326825 2329578 Cut along the side of his own stomach.
2330245 2332748 All right, let's take<br />a fresh look at these.
2332915 2335209 Even though the corpse is there,<br />look through it.
2335375 2337085 Edit out the initial shock.
2337252 2342674 Trick is to find one item,<br />one detail and focus on it...
2342841 2345385 until it's an exhausted possibility.
2345552 2347346 Just gonna get another beer. Beer?
2347513 2349723 Uh, wine, please.
2358273 2359775 He's preaching.
2360150 2361735 He's punishing.
2363529 2366865 The sins were used in medieval sermons.
2367282 2369993 There were seven cardinal virtues<br />and seven deadly sins...
2370160 2371453 used as teaching tools.
2371620 2374122 Yeah, yeah, yeah,<br />like in, uh, The Parson's Tale and...
2374289 2375791 What's this? Uh, Dante.
2375958 2378168 - You read them?<br />- Yeah.
2378335 2381421 Well, parts.<br />Hey, remember in, uh, Purgatory?
2381588 2383966 Dante and his buddy,<br />they're climbing up the hill...
2384132 2386301 they're checking out<br />all the sinners, yeah?
2386468 2389763 - Yeah, the seven terraces of purgation.<br />- Yeah, yeah, right.
2389930 2393183 But there, pride comes first, not gluttony.
2393350 2397354 Yeah, well, for now, let's just consider<br />that the books were the killer's inspiration.
2397521 2400983 The sermons<br />were about atonement for sin.
2401233 2403277 These murders are like forced attrition.
2403986 2406029 - Forced what?<br />- Attrition.
2406196 2408991 It's when you regret your sins,<br />but not because you love God.
2409157 2412202 Oh, like because someone's sticking<br />a fucking gun in your face.
2412369 2413829 Mm-hm.
2416206 2418584 - No fingerprints.<br />- Nope.
2418750 2422004 - Totally unrelated victims.<br />- Yup.
2422170 2424631 And no witnesses of any kind.
2424798 2426466 Which I don't get.
2426633 2429886 Because the fucker had to get back out.
2430387 2434975 Well, in any major city,<br />minding your own business is a science.
2435392 2439021 The first thing they teach women<br />in rape prevention is never cry for help.
2439855 2441356 Always yell "Fire."
2441523 2442816 Nobody answers to "Help."
2442983 2444901 You holler “fire," they come running.
2445319 2446737 That's fucked up.
2446903 2450198 He must've left another puzzle piece.
2451867 2452909 You know what?
2453076 2456371 Thank you for talking this out,<br />but I gotta sleep.
2456747 2460167 - Walk the dogs.<br />- This is just strictly to satisfy my curiosity.
2460334 2463045 - I'm still leaving at the end of the week.<br />- Oh, shit.
2463211 2464838 No, wait, wait.
2466089 2468842 Gould's wife.<br />She was out of town at the time.
2469009 2472220 - So this means she saw something.<br />- What if it's a threat?
2472387 2475057 Well, I put her in a safe house.<br />She wasn't too happy about it.
2484399 2486860 What if it isn't something she has seen?
2487027 2491114 But something she's supposed to see,<br />but hasn't been given a chance?
2491615 2492991 Yeah, okay. What?
2493450 2495118 I don't know.
2496703 2498997 But that's the one thing.
2544042 2545669 Sign us in.
2545836 2547921 Gotta see Mrs. Gould.
2548422 2550424 Treat me like a prisoner.
2550590 2553760 Why do you have a phone<br />if I can't make long distance phone calls?
2553927 2555011 Mrs. Gould?
2555178 2556596 Don't treat people like this.
2561643 2564104 Mrs. Gould, I am sorry. I truly am.
2564896 2566606 I don't understand.
2567315 2571862 Okay, I need you<br />to look at each photo very carefully.
2572028 2576992 Look and see if there's anything strange<br />or out of place.
2577159 2578160 Um, anything at all.
2579202 2581246 - I don't see anything.<br />- You're sure?
2581413 2583915 Please, I just... I<br />can't do this right now.
2584082 2585709 Okay.
2586168 2587753 It's got to be now.
2587919 2590213 There may be something<br />we haven't seen.
2599055 2600474 Wait.
2600640 2602893 - What?<br />- Here.
2606271 2609858 This painting, it's upside down.
2617199 2619242 - You sure your men didn't move this?<br />- No, no.
2619409 2622120 Those shots were taken before forensics.
2625207 2626666 Nothing.
2627584 2630212 There's gotta be something.
2640555 2643391 - Moved the screws to rehang it.<br />- Yep.
2647562 2649439 What the fuck is that?
2650524 2652275 Switchblade.
2660200 2662118 Goddamn it.
2665205 2668083 There must be something.
2672879 2675382 He didn't paint the fucking thing.
2683014 2686059 No, he's fucking with us,<br />that's what he's doing.
2687102 2689145 See this? This is us.
2689771 2690814 Yeah.
2690981 2692607 Just wait a minute.
2695026 2697153 Now Somerset's climbing<br />on the furniture.
2697320 2699281 Just wait a minute.
2704327 2705996 You're kidding me.
2706454 2708623 Call the Print Lab.
2713545 2715463 Oh, man.
2718341 2722971 Honestly, have you ever<br />seen anything like this?
2724681 2726099 No.
2728143 2730979 I can tell you, guys,<br />just by looking at the swirl pattern...
2731354 2733773 they're not the victim's fingerprints.
2743992 2748496 I don't know, man.<br />I say he's whacked enough.
2749789 2750916 It doesn't fit.
2751708 2754461 -He doesn't wants us to help him stop.<br />Who knows?
2754628 2758632 So many freaks out there doing their<br />little evil deeds they don't wanna do.
2758798 2761885 "The voices made me do it.<br />My dog made me do it.
2762052 2763845 Jodie Foster told me to do it."
2764012 2767599 You know, um, I've seen this baby take<br />as long as three days to make a match...
2767766 2771269 So maybe you guys<br />wanna cross your fingers somewhere else.
2774648 2777359 You meant what you said to Mrs. Gould,<br />didn't you?
2777525 2780737 - About catching this guy.<br />- Yeah.
2780904 2782030 Hmm.
2782864 2785784 Wish I still thought the way you do.
2786910 2790705 Why don't you tell me what the hell it is<br />you think we're doing then.
2791081 2793333 Picking up the pieces.
2794542 2799339 We're collecting all the evidence,<br />taking all the pictures and samples.
2799506 2801466 Writing everything down.
2801633 2804302 Noting the time things happened.
2805387 2808556 - That's all?<br />- That's all.
2808723 2812769 Putting everything into neat little piles<br />and filing it away.
2813061 2816898 On the off chance<br />it will ever be needed in the courtroom.
2819192 2822362 Picking up diamonds<br />on a deserted island.
2822529 2826074 Saving them in case we get rescued.
2828910 2830578 Bullshit.
2832455 2836751 Even the most promising clues<br />usually only lead to others.
2837752 2842007 So many corpses roll away unrevenged.
2843967 2848179 Don't try to tell me<br />you didn't get that rush tonight.
2848722 2850598 I saw you.
2851224 2853268 We're getting somewhere.
2868783 2870160 Wake up, Glimmer Twins.
2870660 2872620 You've got a winner.
2878418 2882088 This guy goes by the name of Victor.<br />His real name is Theodore Allen.
2882255 2884924 His prints were found<br />at the scene by Homicide.
2885091 2888553 He's got a long history<br />of serious mental illness.
2888720 2891890 His parents gave him<br />a very strict Southern Baptist upbringing.
2892057 2894726 But somewhere along the line,<br />they fell short.
2895101 2897771 Now, Victor dabbled in drugs,<br />armed robbery and assault.
2897937 2901608 Spent time in prison here a while back<br />for the attempted rape of a minor.
2901775 2904235 But his lawyer saw to it<br />that didn't last long.
2904402 2906988 His lawyer, by the way,<br />is the recently deceased Eli Gould.
2907155 2908740 -Greed murder victim.<br />Yes, sir.
2908907 2911659 We're gonna finish this thing up today,<br />ladies and germs.
2911826 2915830 Victor's been out of circulation a while,<br />but there's still a residence in his name.
2915997 2917707 You're not buying all this, are you?
2917874 2921836 - Doesn't seem like our guy, does it?<br />- You tell me.
2922504 2924506 Our killer seems to have more purpose.
2953535 2954828 You ever take a bullet?
2955370 2958665 Never in my 34 years, knock wood.
2960125 2964170 I've only taken my gun out three times<br />with the intention of using it.
2964337 2965672 Never pulled the trigger.
2965839 2967799 Not once.
2967966 2969050 You?
2969217 2975390 Yeah, but, no, I never took a bullet,<br />but I pulled my gun once, shot it once.
2975557 2977600 - Really?<br />- It was my first one of these.
2977767 2979978 We were a secondary unit.
2980145 2983231 I was pretty shaky going in.<br />I was a rookie then.
2983398 2986693 Anyway, we bust open the door<br />looking for this junkie and, uh...
2986860 2989237 the fucker just opened fire on us.
2989404 2991197 One cop got hit in the arm.
2993241 2995451 Christ, what was his name?
2996786 2998788 Spun him like a top.
2998955 3001040 You know,<br />I mean, more like slow motion.
3002667 3004586 I remember...
3005753 3007088 riding in that ambulance.
3007630 3010216 Well, he died right there.
3010758 3012427 Right there.
3012802 3014929 Christ, what was his fucking name?
3027817 3030987 All rise.<br />Let's do it. Let's do it.
3031863 3034407 Go, go, go. Move.
3036701 3038620 Okay.
3057639 3059307 Get up there.
3093049 3096094 SWAT goes before dicks.
3096261 3097720 Hey.
3099013 3101099 They love this.
3101683 3103434 Police.
3104435 3105812 Clear.
3107855 3109524 -Clear.<br />Clear.
3109691 3110900 Clear.
3124205 3125707 Clear.
3133589 3135466 Morning, sweetheart.
3136384 3137885 Get up now, motherfucker.
3138052 3139345 Now!
3148396 3150440 Get up, you sack of shit.
3156988 3158740 Oh, fuck me.
3158906 3163077 Dicks, you'll wanna<br />come take a look at this.
3165872 3167498 Dicks!
3173004 3174213 Oof.
3174380 3175423 Jesus.
3175798 3177633 -Victor?<br />What the hell?
3177800 3179052 Yeah, it's just Victor.
3179218 3181179 Call an ambulance.<br />What is this?
3181346 3183598 Hearse more like it.<br />Also Forensics.
3183765 3185975 -California, get your people out.<br />Go on now.
3186142 3187602 No one touches anything.
3187769 3189937 It's some frigging wax sculpture<br />or something.
3194067 3195276 "Sloth."”
3204827 3206079 Oh, man.
3206245 3208039 Goddamn.
3208206 3210917 Those pictures were dated three days ago.
3218883 3221094 This must be the first one. Look.
3222095 3224430 It's dated exactly one year ago today.
3226724 3232480 I got a hair sample, I got a stool sample,<br />I got piss, I got fingernails.
3234524 3238569 - He's laughing at us.<br />- You got what you deserved.
3241447 3243074 He's alive, he's alive!
3243241 3245034 -That cocksucker's alive!<br />Guns down.
3245201 3248162 - Still breathing!<br />- Guns down! Emergency on that ambulance!
3256003 3257088 Coming through.
3265346 3268433 - He's playing games.<br />- No shit.
3269225 3272145 Look, we have to divorce ourselves<br />from emotion here.
3272311 3273354 Oh.
3273521 3275561 No matter how hard it is,<br />we have to remain focused.
3275690 3277859 Hey, man, I feed off my emotions.<br />How's that?
3278025 3280820 - Are you listening to me?<br />- Yes, I can hear you.
3280987 3282613 Excuse me.<br />- What are you doing?
3282780 3285366 - Closed crime scene, get out.<br />- I got a right to be here.
3285533 3286909 - UPI photographer.<br />- Get out.
3287076 3289829 Hey, I got a fucking right to be here.<br />Get out of here.
3289996 3291914 - Get out. Jesus.<br />- Fucking jerk. Fuck you.
3292081 3293708 - I got your picture, man.<br />- Oh, yeah?
3293875 3295334 I got your picture.<br />Yeah?
3295501 3298546 Detective Mills, M-I-L-L-S, fuck off.
3298713 3301007 I'm surprised you can spell.<br />Fuck you.
3301757 3304093 How do they get here so fucking quick?
3304552 3306637 They pay police for the information.
3306804 3307847 And they pay well.
3308723 3310683 Hey, man, I'm sorry, I...
3310850 3312518 Those, ugh...
3312810 3315396 - You know, they piss me off.<br />- It's okay.
3315563 3318065 It's impressive to see a man<br />feeding off his emotions.
3325031 3327074 A year of immobility seems about right...
3327241 3330161 judging by the deterioration<br />of the muscles and the spine.
3330328 3333831 Blood tests show a whole smorgasbord<br />of drugs in his system.
3333998 3335249 Even an antibiotic...
3335416 3339629 which must've been administered<br />to keep the bed sores from infecting.
3339795 3343758 Now, has he tried to speak<br />or communicate in any way?
3343925 3346594 Even if his brain were not mush,<br />which it is...
3346761 3349639 he chewed off<br />his own tongue long ago.
3351140 3353226 Uh, Doc.
3354018 3357271 Is there absolutely no chance<br />that he might survive?
3357772 3363069 Detective, he'd die of shock right now if<br />you were to shine a flashlight in his eyes.
3363236 3366781 He's experienced about as much pain<br />and suffering as anyone I've encountered.
3366948 3368783 Give or take.
3369242 3372245 And he still has hell to look forward to.
3372495 3373538 Good night.
3374956 3377542 Tonight we bring you<br />the Charlie Parker Quintet.
3377708 3380711 Featuring Sir Charles Thompson on piano,<br />Herb Pomeroy's trumpet...
3380878 3385424 Jimmy Woode, bass, Kenny Clarke, drums,<br />and the alto saxophone of Charlie Parker.
3385591 3388135 -Yeah?<br />Hello, William?
3388302 3392014 - It's Tracy.<br />- Tracy?
3392181 3396519 -Is everything all right?<br />Yeah, yes, everything's fine.
3396686 3398354 -Where's David?<br />He's just, uh...
3398521 3400898 He's in the other room.<br />He's in the shower.
3401065 3403985 Um, I'm sorry to call you like this.
3404151 3406028 Oh, it's all right. Um...
3406487 3408030 What can I do for you, Tracy?
3409574 3411158 [, uh...
3412118 3413661 Um, heh.
3413828 3415705 I need someone to talk to.
3415871 3419333 Do you think<br />you could meet me somewhere...
3419500 3421002 maybe tomorrow morning?
3422169 3424338 I don't understand.
3424964 3428050 I feel stupid calling, but, uh...
3429135 3432513 you're the only person<br />that I know here.
3432680 3434015 There's no one else.
3434599 3438644 If you can, just, uh, give me a call, okay?
3438811 3440813 I have to go now.
3441355 3443691 - Well, good night.<br />- Good night.
3452992 3456829 I mean, you know this city so well.
3456996 3460958 You've been here so long.
3461876 3464211 It can be a hard place.
3464587 3467048 I don't know why I asked you to come.
3468883 3471177 Why don't you talk to him about it?
3471344 3473012 Tell him how you feel.
3474221 3477058 I can't. You know, I can't be a burden.
3477224 3479310 Especially now.
3481062 3483064 I'll get used to things.
3483230 3485191 You know? I think I just...
3485358 3489654 I wanted to talk to someone<br />who's lived here for a long time and...
3489987 3496202 I mean, upstate, you know,<br />it's a completely different environment.
3498871 3501374 Did David tell you<br />that I teach fifth grade?
3501540 3503209 Well, I did.
3504919 3507004 Uh, he mentioned it.
3510049 3513594 I've been going around,<br />you know, looking at schools.
3515429 3519767 But the conditions here are horrible.
3521060 3522140 What about private schools?
3525272 3527233 I don't know.
3528275 3531445 Why don't you tell me<br />what's really bothering you, Tracy.
3533614 3536242 David and I are gonna have a baby.
3540705 3542707 Oh, Tracy, I...
3543833 3545710 I don't think I'm the, heh...
3545876 3548170 I'm the one to talk to about this.
3548337 3550589 I hate this city.
3554385 3556929 I had a relationship once.
3557304 3559306 It was very much like a marriage.
3562268 3564311 We got pregnant.
3565104 3567106 This was a long time ago.
3573028 3576323 I remember getting up one morning<br />and going to work.
3578159 3582872 Just another day like any other, except<br />it was the first day after I knew about...
3583456 3585082 the pregnancy.
3586208 3591338 And I felt this fear<br />for the first time ever.
3593424 3597762 I remember thinking how can I bring a child<br />into a world like this?
3597928 3602183 How can...? How can a person grow up<br />with all this around them?
3609690 3612109 I told her I didn't want to have it.
3614111 3615905 And over the next few weeks...
3617323 3619325 wore her down.
3621702 3623954 I wanna have children.
3628375 3630711 I can tell you now that...
3631253 3633380 I'm... I know, I mean...
3635591 3639512 I'm positive<br />that I made the right decision.
3639678 3641972 But there's not a day that passes...
3642139 3646602 that I don't wish<br />that I had made a different choice.
3649730 3652316 If you don't keep...
3653734 3657238 The baby, I mean,<br />if that's your decision...
3659073 3661492 don't ever tell him<br />that you were pregnant.
3663202 3666622 But if you choose to have this baby...
3667122 3670668 you spoil that kid<br />every chance you get.
3677299 3682137 That's about all the advice<br />I can give you, Tracy.
3689186 3690771 I got to go.
3690938 3692606 William.
3699363 3700531 Thank you.
3714378 3718382 Victor's landlord said there was an<br />envelope of cash in the office mailbox...
3718549 3720634 the first of every month.
3725139 3726557 Quote:
3726724 3730185 "I never heard a single complaint<br />from the tenant in Apartment 306.
3730352 3732980 - And nobody ever complained about him.<br />- Heh.
3733147 3735733 He's the best tenant I've ever had,"<br />end quote.
3735900 3737818 Yeah, a landlord's dream.
3737985 3739653 A paralyzed tenant with no tongue.
3739820 3741447 Who pays the rent on time.
3742615 3745492 - I'm sick of all this waiting.<br />- This is the job.
3746952 3748287 Why aren't we out there, huh?
3748454 3753667 Why do we gotta sit here rotting,<br />waiting till the lunatic does it again?
3753834 3756712 It's dismissive to call him a lunatic.<br />Don't make that mistake.
3756879 3759506 Come on, he's insane. Look.
3759673 3763636 Right now he's probably dancing around<br />in his grandma's panties.
3763802 3766764 Yeah, rubbing himself in peanut butter.<br />Ooh.
3767181 3770059 - How's that?<br />- I don't think so.
3770935 3773562 His luck will run out.
3774188 3776398 Not depending on luck.
3779276 3783113 We walked into that apartment exactly<br />one year after he tied Victor to the bed.
3783280 3785199 One year to the day.
3785366 3787660 - He wanted us to.<br />- Don't know that for sure.
3787826 3789578 Oh, yes, we do.
3790371 3792289 This note he left.
3792456 3794166 His first words to us.
3800798 3802007 Fuck him. So what?
3802174 3804051 He's right, so far.
3804218 3808722 Imagine the will it takes<br />to keep a man bound for a full year.
3808889 3812726 To sever his hand<br />and use it to plant fingerprints.
3812893 3815688 To insert tubes into his genitals.
3816105 3820901 This guy is methodical, exacting,<br />and worst of all, patient.
3821276 3823028 He's a nut bag.
3823195 3827449 And just because the fucker's got<br />a library card doesn't make him Yoda.
3831787 3835124 - How much money you got?<br />- I got like 50.50 bucks.
3835290 3838252 I propose a field trip. Come on.
3841588 3842589 We'll make a list.
3842756 3845592 At the top we'll put Purgatory,<br />Canterbury Tales.
3845759 3848387 Anything relating<br />to the seven deadly sins.
3848554 3850014 - Ask yourself...<br />- Hey, wait, wait.
3850180 3852933 What would he study<br />to do the things he's done?
3853100 3855144 What are his interests now?
3855644 3857438 Jack the Ripper, for instance.
3857604 3859314 Where are we going?<br />Library.
3873620 3875497 Coupons, coupons, free coupons.
3875664 3878083 Discount... Discount coupons.
3879376 3883630 They must've had about 50 health<br />violations during the last inspection.
3883797 3888469 Could you at least sit across from me?<br />I don't want people thinking we're dating.
3888635 3890637 Give me your money.
3891638 3895934 I'm giving you this, but for some reason,<br />I don't think I know what we're doing.
3898479 3899980 Fuck.
3900981 3903025 Hey, Somerset, how you doing?<br />- Okay.
3903192 3906653 - Didn't figure this was a ménage a trots.<br />- It's not a problem.
3906820 3908489 Sit down.
3912826 3916330 Only for you do I do this,<br />so it's a big risk.
3916663 3918999 So I figure we're just fair and square.
3919166 3921376 - It's a deal.<br />- All right.
3925380 3927091 About an hour.
3928842 3931136 Yeah, help yourself.
3933097 3935432 Well, that was money well spent.
3936350 3937684 Yeah.
3945359 3946652 All right.
3946819 3950030 By telling you this, I'm trusting you more<br />than I trust most people.
3950197 3952991 Well, good,<br />because I'm ready to punch you.
3954743 3958914 It's probably nothing, but even<br />if it is, it's no skin off our teeth.
3961708 3964503 The guy in the pizza parlor<br />is a friend from the Bureau.
3966547 3967631 Who, stinky man?
3968590 3972594 See, for years the FBI's been hooked<br />into the library system, keeping records.
3972761 3977099 - Mm-hm. Assessing fines?<br />- No, monitoring reading habits.
3977266 3978600 - Look.<br />- What?
3978767 3980644 Certain books are flagged.
3980811 3985399 Books on, say, nuclear weapons<br />and, well, Mein Kampf.
3985566 3987442 Anyone who checks out a flagged book...
3987609 3990571 has his library records fed<br />into the FBI's computers then on.
3990737 3992739 Wait, wait, wait, how is this legal?
3992906 3995742 Oh, legal, illegal.<br />These terms don't apply.
3995909 3997077 -You...
3997244 4001415 You can't use the information directly.<br />It's just a useful guide.
4001582 4004251 It might sound silly,<br />but you can't get a library card...
4004418 4006458 without, uh, an ID<br />and a current phone bill, see?
4010257 4012926 - So they run a list.<br />- Precisely.
4013093 4016471 If you wanna know who's reading<br />Purgatory and Paradise Lost...
4016638 4021643 and Helter Skelter,<br />the FBI's computers will tell us.
4021810 4023770 - It could give us a name.<br />- It could.
4023937 4027774 Could get a name of some college kid<br />writing a term paper on 20th-century crime.
4028650 4030777 At least you're out of the office.
4030944 4032654 Get a haircut.
4033614 4035532 - How do you know all this?<br />- I don't.
4036241 4038827 - Neither do you.<br />- Exactly.
4046627 4050881 "The Divine Comedy.<br />History of Catholicism.”
4051048 4053217 There's a book called<br />Murderers and Madmen.
4053383 4057179 "Modern Homicide Investigation,<br />In Cold Blood.
4057471 4059348 Of Human Bondage." Bondage?
4059514 4061808 - Not what you think.<br />- Okay.
4061975 4064144 "The Marquis de Sade."
4064311 4066146 - It's the Marquis de Sade.<br />- Whatever.
4066313 4068690 "The Writings of Saint Thomas Aqua..."<br />Something.
4068857 4071109 Saint Thomas Aquinas. There it is.
4071276 4074112 He wrote about the seven deadly sins.
4074279 4076865 - Is that it?<br />- Yeah.
4077491 4080327 - Let's try it.<br />- Jonathan Doe?
4080494 4081578 Whatever.
4081745 4083330 We're sure about that name?
4083497 4084498 Yeah.
4084665 4087209 You saw it, John Doe.
4087376 4089795 You wanna go back, I'll go back.
4089962 4092214 Let's take a look at him. Talk to him.
4092965 4094508 This is crazy.
4094675 4097469 - Ah, we'll just talk to him.<br />- Uh-huh.
4097636 4101056 "Excuse me, Sir.<br />Are you by any chance a serial killer?"
4102432 4104059 Okay.
4104226 4106103 You do the talking.
4106895 4109064 - Put that silver tongue of yours to work.<br />- No.
4109231 4111483 You been talking to my wife?
4114403 4116655 This is retarded.
4116822 4118615 Charlie's Fucking Angels.
4119366 4121785 A name off a computer.
4125122 4126707 Mills.
4134131 4135632 Fuck.
4137217 4139553 - You hit?<br />- No.
4142139 4144641 He's going down, he's going down!
4160741 4162159 Fifth floor.
4162326 4163785 Mills.
4165412 4167414 Mommy?
4168081 4169416 Mommy?
4182429 4184723 Police. Is there a back way out?
4185223 4186266 Lock your door.
4188101 4191980 What the hell is going on, man?<br />- Get out of the fucking hall, please.
4217381 4218882 - Get down.<br />- Aah!
4219049 4220133 Hey.
4220675 4222010 Get the fuck down.
4251039 4252207 Aah!
4255669 4257254 Shit.
4258672 4261174 Get the fuck out of there.
4273019 4276690 Hey! Shut the fuck up!
4319107 4320317 Goddamn it.
4330827 4332204 Fuck.
4383046 4385674 Get out of the fucking way! Move!
4446192 4448028 Mills?
4449029 4450697 No.
4470967 4472427 Mills.
4474471 4477891 - Mills, you okay?<br />- I'm all right.
4480060 4481728 I'm all right.
4485690 4487442 Where are you going?<br />- I'm going in.
4487609 4490028 No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.
4490362 4492030 - Wait.<br />- What are you talking about?
4492197 4493573 - He shot at us.<br />- You can't.
4493740 4495533 - The hell we can't.<br />- We need a warrant.
4495700 4497410 We got probable cause. Come on.
4497577 4498745 Think about it, think.
4498912 4500413 - How did we get here?<br />- Huh?
4500580 4503792 - I can't tell anyone this, I can't tell anyone.<br />- Oh, come on, out of the way.
4503958 4505835 We have no reason to be here.
4506002 4507462 - Will you listen to me?<br />- Get off.
4507629 4509798 - Listen to me, listen.<br />- Get the fuck off me.
4509964 4511591 All right, all right, I'm sorry.
4511758 4514260 But would you<br />just pay attention a minute?
4514427 4517722 If we leave a hole like this,<br />we won't be able to prosecute.
4517889 4520558 The fucking guy will walk.<br />Now, is that what you want?
4520725 4523520 By the time we clear a warrant,<br />someone else... No, fuck that.
4523687 4528024 - We need a reason to knock on this door.<br />- No, no.
4528525 4530318 Think about it.
4531569 4533154 Okay?
4535240 4537283 Okay, man. Okay.
4537450 4539994 You're right. I'm all fucked up.
4540161 4542122 When you're right, you're right.
4550004 4554217 Well, no point in arguing anymore.
4555218 4556803 Unless you can fix that.
4558722 4561850 You stupid son of a...
4569774 4571735 How much money we got left?
4572527 4576239 So, yeah,<br />like, I noticed this guy going out a lot.
4576406 4579325 When the murders was happening,<br />so I, um...
4579492 4581828 - So...<br />- So you called Detective Somerset, right?
4581995 4586124 Yeah, right, right, so I called the detective,<br />because this guy was creepy and shit.
4586291 4589002 And one of the murders,<br />it happened right over there.
4589169 4591796 - Okay. I told you the rest. You got it?<br />- Called the cops.
4591963 4593006 - Good?<br />- Got your story.
4593173 4594883 - Have her sign. You gotta sign.<br />- Okay.
4595049 4597302 Okay? Good, good, good.
4597469 4600180 - All right.<br />- You did good.
4600346 4602640 I did what you said.<br />Here you go.
4602807 4605351 You get something to eat, all right?<br />You eat.
4608438 4610565 Everybody, stay outside.
4671876 4673461 Victor.
4806386 4808721 Somerset!
4809847 4813226 - Somerset!<br />- Yeah?
4816771 4819315 - What?<br />- We had him.
4819607 4821275 What are you talking about?
4821442 4824904 The fucking photographer<br />in the fucking stairs.
4829409 4831869 We had him and we let him go.
4838251 4839794 You're sure this is him?
4839961 4841254 Yup, good, good. Yup.
4841421 4843089 -Yeah, good, get it out.<br />All right.
4843256 4846426 Uh, we've got nothing, no pay stubs,<br />no appointment books, no addresses.
4846592 4848512 - This is the best, this receipt.<br />- Keep looking.
4848594 4850555 Let me show you something.<br />This was under the bed.
4850722 4852682 Uh, his only source of funds.
4852849 4855184 No kidding, we got his money.<br />Fucking A, I like it.
4855351 4856436 One thing.<br />Yes?
4856602 4859564 You're probably not gonna believe this.<br />We haven't found a fingerprint yet.
4859731 4863735 - Um, not a single one.<br />- You're right, I don't. Keep looking.
4868531 4869991 We could use some more men here.
4870158 4873578 Hey, man, I'm doing the best I can.<br />What are you getting with all this?
4873745 4875747 There are 2000 notebooks<br />on these shelves.
4875913 4878791 And each notebook contains<br />about 250 pages.
4878958 4881586 Forget it. Anything about the killings?
4882003 4886215 "What sick ridiculous puppets we are,<br />and what a gross stage we dance on.
4886382 4890303 What fun we have dancing and fucking.<br />Not a care in the world.
4890470 4892138 Not knowing that we are nothing.
4892305 4894557 We are not what was intended."
4894724 4897143 No, wait, there's a lot more.
4898144 4901481 "On the subway today, a man came up<br />to me to start a conversation.
4902023 4906152 He made small talk, a lonely man,<br />talking about the weather and things.
4906319 4908446 I tried to be pleasant and accommodating.
4908613 4911407 But my head began to hurt<br />from his banality.
4911574 4916537 I almost didn't notice it had happened,<br />but I suddenly threw up all over him.
4916829 4921626 He was not pleased.<br />And I couldn't stop laughing."
4922460 4923961 No dates.
4924128 4927465 Placed on the shelves<br />in no discernible order.
4928382 4931469 Just his mind poured out on paper.
4931636 4933012 Looks like a life's work.
4933179 4936557 If we had 50 men reading in 24-hour shifts,<br />it'd still take two months.
4936724 4938476 I know, I know, I know.
4942563 4943815 Where's that phone?
4947193 4948778 Phone? Phone?
4948945 4950029 Phone?
4952949 4954951 People, quiet.
4969882 4972718 -Hello?<br />I admire you.
4973553 4977140 I don't know how you found me,<br />but imagine my surprise.
4977890 4981018 I respect you law enforcement agents<br />more every day.
4981185 4984230 Well, I appreciate that, John.
4984397 4986107 - I tell you...<br />No, listen, all right?
4986274 4990361 I'll be re-adjusting my schedule<br />in light of today's little setback.
4990528 4992947 I just had to call<br />and express my admiration.
4993114 4995950 Sorry I had to hurt one of you...
4996117 4998744 - but I didn't really have a choice, did I?<br />- Hmm.
4998911 5000621 You will accept my apology, won't you?
5000788 5003207 I feel like saying more,<br />but I don't wanna ruin the surprise.
5008129 5011007 Adjusting my<br />schedule after today's little setback.
5011174 5012508 Got it.
5016929 5018764 All right, everybody, back to work.
5020766 5022185 -You were right.<br />Hmm?
5022351 5025938 - Ugh, he's preaching.<br />- Yeah.
5026564 5028566 These murders are his sermons to us.
5029025 5032278 Look, we know him,<br />we know him, we know him.
5035072 5036824 Who's the blonde?
5040828 5042455 Looks like a pro.
5042622 5044040 Maybe.
5044207 5046542 She caught John Doe's eye.
5051797 5054342 Yeah, he came and collected it last night.
5054508 5056010 Last night?<br />Yeah.
5056177 5057637 - This man?<br />- Yeah, John Doe.
5057803 5060014 It's an easy name to remember.<br />He had a limp.
5060181 5063809 - What was this job you did for him?<br />- I've got a picture of it. Hang on.
5063976 5066145 One sweet piece, actually.
5066312 5069649 I thought he was one of them<br />performance artists, that's what I thought.
5069815 5075571 You know, the sort of guy that pisses<br />in a cup on stage and, uh, then drinks it.
5075738 5078115 - Performance art.<br />- Hmm.
5081035 5083204 I think I undercharged him, actually.
5083371 5084622 You made this for him?
5084789 5087500 Yeah, |I've made weirder shit<br />than that. So what?
5093422 5095216 They found the blonde.
5098094 5099512 The picture.
5099679 5100888 The picture.
5102515 5103933 Fucking pigs.
5106060 5108854 We need you to move, pal.<br />I'll come out, but you guys...
5109021 5112358 Get the fuck out of the booth.<br />- I've been in this cage the whole time.
5112525 5114735 - Okay?<br />- I'm not fucking with you.
5114902 5116654 Come on, this way.
5123369 5125162 Can you do something<br />about this music?
5125329 5127957 Yeah, we're working on it.<br />We're looking for the guy.
5140678 5142388 You from Homicide? You...
5142555 5144515 - You better see this.<br />- Yeah. All right.
5146267 5148769 Hey, easy. Got him?
5150896 5153232 Get this thing off of me.
5153607 5155443 Oh, God, get this thing off of me!
5156068 5157653 Get this thing off of me!
5157820 5159822 -Get this off!<br />Get him out of here, now.
5159989 5161449 Get him out of here, now!
5162867 5164994 Come on, I wanna hear it again.
5165161 5168414 -Tell me again.<br />Just... I don't know.
5168789 5171917 You heard nothing strange,<br />you saw nothing strange.
5172460 5174086 -No.<br />No.
5175796 5177465 He asked me if I was married.
5177631 5180676 - And I could see he had a gun in his hand.<br />- Where was the girl?
5180885 5183137 The what? What?
5183304 5185765 The girl, the prostitute. Where was she?
5185973 5188434 Someone comes to your establishment.
5188601 5191437 They want to go downstairs<br />and wanna get a little ooh la la.
5191604 5193105 Whatever.
5193272 5196650 - They got to come to you, yeah?<br />- Yeah.
5196817 5198194 You didn't see anyone?
5199195 5202573 With a package? A knapsack?<br />Something under their arm?
5202740 5206994 Hey, everybody that comes in there's<br />got a package under their arms.
5207161 5210539 Some guys are carrying suitcases<br />full of stuff.
5210706 5213334 She was just sitting on the bed.
5219799 5222134 Who tied her down? You or him?
5222635 5224929 Do you like what you do for a living?
5225221 5228015 - These things you see?<br />- No.
5229141 5230810 No, I don't.
5232311 5234980 But that's life, isn't it?
5238609 5244323 He had a gun and he made it happen.
5246158 5247868 He made me do it.
5248035 5251539 He put that thing on me.
5251705 5254333 And he made me wear it.
5254500 5258504 Then he told me to fuck her.
5259964 5262174 And I did. I fucked her.
5262967 5264427 Oh, God. Oh, God.
5264593 5266595 Oh, God, he had a gun in my mouth.
5266762 5270391 The fucking gun was in my throat.
5270975 5272017 Fuck.
5275020 5276605 Oh, God, God.
5276772 5279650 God, help me. Please, please, help me.
5279817 5281527 Please, please, help me.
5298836 5301589 You know,<br />this isn't gonna have a happy ending.
5301755 5305176 - It's not possible.<br />- Hey, if we catch him, I'll be happy enough.
5307386 5310097 If we catch John Doe<br />and he turns out to be the devil...
5310264 5314059 I mean, if he's Satan himself,<br />that might live up to our expectations...
5314226 5317104 but he's not the devil.
5318731 5320232 He's just a man.
5321108 5322735 You know...
5322902 5325738 see, you bitch and you complain<br />and you tell me these things. These:
5327531 5331494 If you think you're preparing me<br />for hard times, thank you, but...
5332161 5334830 But you gotta be a hero.
5335623 5338918 You wanna be a champion. Let me<br />tell you, people don't want a champion.
5339084 5341587 They wanna eat cheeseburgers,<br />play lotto and watch TV.
5341754 5343506 How did you get like this?
5344089 5346884 - I wanna know.<br />- Ah.
5349929 5352431 It wasn't one thing, I can tell you that.
5353974 5355267 Go on.
5358479 5362942 I just don't think I can continue to live in<br />a place that embraces and nurtures apathy...
5363108 5365361 as if it was a virtue.
5365945 5367446 You're no different, no better.
5367780 5370407 I didn't say I was different or better.<br />I'm not.
5370574 5373619 Hell, I sympathize.<br />I sympathize completely.
5373786 5376121 Apathy is a solution.
5376288 5380918 I mean, it's easier to lose yourself<br />in drugs than it is to cope with life.
5381085 5383128 - Yeah.<br />- It's easier to steal what you want...
5383295 5384797 - than it is to earn it.<br />- Yeah.
5384964 5387299 It's easier to beat a child<br />than it is to raise it.
5387466 5390261 Hell, love costs. It takes effort and work.
5390427 5392972 We are talking<br />about people who are mentally ill.
5393138 5395849 We are talking<br />about people, fucking crazies.
5396016 5397476 - No. No, we're not.<br />- Yes, today.
5397643 5400896 We're talking about everyday life here.
5402273 5404650 You can't afford to be this naive.
5404817 5406402 Fuck off.
5406569 5410823 See, you should listen to yourself. Yeah.
5410990 5414660 You say that the problem<br />with people is that they don't care.
5415661 5417496 So I don't care about people.
5417830 5419373 It makes no sense. You know why?
5419832 5421834 - Uh, you care?<br />- You wanna know...?
5422001 5424503 - Damn right.<br />- And you're gonna make a difference?
5424670 5428966 Whatever, the point is,<br />is that I don't think you're quitting...
5429133 5432344 because you believe these things<br />you say. I don't.
5432511 5436015 I think you wanna believe them<br />because you're quitting.
5437683 5441103 You want me to agree and say,<br />"Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right.
5441270 5443230 It's all fucked up. It's a fucking mess.
5443397 5446817 We should all go live<br />in a fucking log cabin."”
5447443 5449194 But I won't.
5449361 5451488 I won't say that.
5452323 5455743 I don't agree with you. I do not.
5459371 5460914 I can't.
5470341 5472176 I'm gonna go home.
5479892 5481560 Thank you, though.
5511757 5513592 I love you, honey.
5514093 5516220 So much.
5517429 5519431 So much.
5523727 5525479 I know.
5587499 5590002 911, what's your emergency?
5590836 5591879 Could you repeat that?
5592045 5595507 I've gone and done it again.
5605559 5606769 What have we got?
5607102 5609354 Uh, sleeping pills.
5610105 5611690 Glued to one hand.
5611857 5613400 Telephone glued to the other.
5615194 5616361 You see what he did?
5617488 5618864 He sliced her up.
5619490 5620949 Then he bandaged her.
5621533 5623535 Call for help and you'll live.
5623702 5625996 But you'll be disfigured.
5626872 5629917 Or you can put yourself<br />out of your own misery.
5630959 5632044 Come on.
5632377 5633545 Cut off her nose.
5633712 5635380 To spite her face.
5635547 5638217 And he did it very recently.
5645265 5646725 Listen.
5647392 5652397 I've decided to stay on till this is done.<br />I figure one of two things will happen.
5652564 5657194 We'll get John Doe or he'll finish his series<br />of seven and this case will go on for years.
5657361 5660572 Hey man, you don't have to do me<br />any favors. Thank you, but I got it.
5660739 5664076 I'm requesting that you keep<br />me on as your partner for a few more days.
5664243 5666161 You'd be doing me a favor.
5676839 5678382 You knew I'd say yes.
5678549 5680008 -Hey, we're here.<br />Wonderful.
5680175 5683637 Your wife called.<br />Get yourself an answering machine.
5685806 5687474 Detective?
5688684 5690936 After this, I'm gone.
5691436 5693939 -No big surprise.<br />Detective!
5696942 5698318 You're looking for me.
5698777 5699778 Hey!
5701154 5703615 Don't you fucking move.<br />On the fucking floor.
5703782 5705075 Keep away from him!
5705242 5706952 On the fucking floor.<br />- I know you.
5707119 5708495 Now. Get down.
5709204 5711915 Get down on your stomach,<br />you piece of shit.
5712082 5713959 Now. All the way!
5714126 5716295 All the way, fucker! Down!
5716461 5719006 Faster. Faster. Faster, fucker.
5719172 5722426 Now. Nose on the ground.
5725262 5728056 Jesus Christ. What the fuck is this?
5728223 5731393 I'd like to speak to my lawyer, please.
5733145 5735022 Goddamn it.
5736815 5738984 He cuts the skin off the tips<br />of his fingers.
5739151 5743405 That's why we couldn't find one single<br />usable print in his apartment.
5743572 5745908 Looks like he's been doing it<br />for a quite sometime.
5746074 5748493 What about the bank accounts? The guns?
5748660 5750495 So far everything's a dead end.
5750662 5753415 No credit history. No employment records.
5753582 5757336 His bank account's only 5 years old<br />and it was started with cash.
5757502 5759379 We're even trying to trace his furniture.
5759546 5761965 About only thing we know about that guy<br />right now...
5762132 5766970 Is that he's independently wealthy,<br />well-educated and totally insane.
5767137 5769139 Because he's John Doe by choice.
5769306 5771850 -Okay, so when do we get to question him?<br />You don't.
5772017 5773852 -He going to court now.<br />What?
5774019 5776480 I'm telling you,<br />there's no way he'd turn himself in.
5776647 5778273 It doesn't make any sense.
5778440 5782027 Well, there he sits.<br />It's not supposed to make any sense.
5782194 5784863 - He's not finished.<br />- No, he's pissing in our faces.
5785030 5789284 We're just taking it like idiots.<br />You know what I'm talking about.
5789451 5793372 For the first time ever,<br />you and I are in total agreement.
5793622 5797042 -He wouldn't just stop.<br />Ugh, so, what the fuck, man?
5797209 5800420 He's two murders away<br />from completing his masterpiece.
5801838 5803924 We'll wait for his plea.
5807052 5811640 My client says there are two more bodies.<br />Two more victims hidden away.
5811807 5814601 He will take Detectives Mills<br />and Somerset to these bodies...
5814768 5818939 but only Detective Mills and Somerset,<br />only at 6:00 today.
5819106 5820691 Why us?
5820857 5822317 He says he admires you.
5824069 5825404 It's part of the game.
5825570 5828323 The client claims<br />if the detectives do not accept this...
5828490 5832411 - these bodies will never be found.<br />- Frankly, I'm inclined to let them rot.
5832577 5833829 Hey.
5833996 5835247 We've got him.
5835414 5837624 Downstairs, locked up. Done deal.
5837791 5840836 He's gonna get his free room and board,<br />get his free cable TV.
5841003 5844464 Hell, my wife doesn't even have cable.<br />Why are we having this conversation?
5844631 5847092 - Mills.<br />- No. Hey, something stinks.
5847259 5848427 And this one here...
5848593 5852264 Yeah, you, in your $3000 suit<br />and that smug smile on your face...
5852431 5855017 - dealing for that shit, I don't like it...<br />- Mills.
5855183 5857436 I am required by law to serve my clients...
5857602 5859354 - to the best of my ability.<br />- Aw, Jesus.
5859521 5862983 - To serve their best interest.<br />- We don't make deals here, Mr. Swarr.
5863150 5865569 My client wishes inform you<br />if you do not accept...
5865736 5868363 he will plead insanity across the board.
5868530 5870198 Let him try it.
5870365 5871491 I'd like to see him try.
5871658 5874661 Come on, now, we all know<br />the extreme nature of these crimes...
5874828 5877247 I could get him off with such a plea.
5877414 5880125 I'm not letting this conviction slide.<br />I can tell you that.
5880292 5883920 He says that if you do accept<br />under his specific conditions...
5884087 5886715 he'll sign a full confession,<br />plead guilty right now.
5887090 5889301 It's your case. Make a decision.
5891094 5892721 Full confession.
5892888 5895682 - I'm In.<br />- It has to be the both of you.
5897142 5902606 If he were to claim insanity,<br />this conversation is admissible.
5902773 5905025 The fact that he's blackmailing us<br />with his plea.
5905192 5907819 And my client would like to remind you<br />two more are dead.
5907986 5909488 Press would have a field day...
5909654 5912616 if they find out the police didn't seem<br />concerned about them.
5912783 5915994 - Giving them a proper burial.<br />- If in fact there are two more dead.
5916161 5920332 Lab report came up from downtown. They<br />did a quickie on Doe's clothing and nails.
5920499 5924002 They found blood from Doe.<br />From him slicing his fingers.
5924169 5926797 Blood from the woman<br />who's face he cut off.
5926963 5931676 And blood from a third party,<br />as yet unidentified.
5934888 5936973 You'd be escorting an unarmed man.
5940018 5941478 Let's finish it.
5945107 5948110 If John Doe's head splits open<br />and a UFO should fly out...
5948527 5951029 I want you to have expected it.
5952697 5954366 I will.
5956660 5958912 Hey, man, if I was<br />to accidentally shave off a nipple...
5959079 5960705 would it be covered<br />by workman's comp?
5960872 5961873 Hmm.
5966086 5968171 I suppose so.
5968880 5970382 - Yeah.<br />- If you were man enough...
5970549 5974761 to actually file a claim,<br />I'd buy you one out of my own pocket.
5975720 5978974 If I keep coming home late,<br />my wife's gonna think something's up.
5988066 5989568 You know...
5990735 5992028 Yeah.
5997868 5999161 What?
6070774 6071983 Let's go.
6102430 6104849 C-Victor-5-5 take. Clear the TC.
6105016 6106268 Pull around.
6107686 6110772 There it is.<br />Late-model black sedan at your 10 o'clock.
6120031 6121199 Who are you, John?
6122284 6124077 Who are you really?
6124369 6125453 What do you mean?
6125620 6129374 At this stage, what harm can it do<br />to tell us a bit about yourself?
6129874 6133044 It doesn't matter who I am.<br />Who I am means absolutely nothing.
6133211 6135130 You need to stay on your left up here.
6139384 6141094 So where are we heading?
6141761 6142804 You'll see.
6143555 6147058 We're not just going to pick up<br />two more dead bodies, are we, John?
6147559 6149436 That wouldn't be shocking enough.
6149602 6152731 We've got newspapers<br />to think about, yeah?
6153815 6156026 Wanting people to listen...
6156192 6159738 you can't just tap them<br />on the shoulder anymore.
6159904 6162282 You have to hit them<br />with a sledgehammer.
6162449 6165410 And then you'll notice<br />you've got their strict attention.
6165577 6167454 But the question is:
6167620 6170290 What makes you so special<br />that people should listen?
6170832 6171958 I'm not special.
6173084 6175587 I've never been exceptional.
6175920 6179591 This is, though, what I'm doing.<br />My work.
6180050 6181343 Your work, John?
6181926 6183053 Yes.
6183219 6186181 See, I don't... I don't see<br />anything special about it, John.
6187599 6188641 That's not true.
6188808 6189893 No, it is true.
6190060 6193229 And the funny thing is, all this work...
6193396 6195398 two months from now,<br />no one's gonna care.
6195565 6197901 No one's gonna give a shit,<br />no one's gonna remember.
6198068 6201112 You can't see the whole complete<br />act yet.
6201863 6203448 But when this is done...
6204783 6206117 when it's finished...
6207952 6209454 it's going to be...
6212457 6215794 People will barely be able<br />to comprehend.
6215960 6218004 But they won't be able to deny.
6219631 6221091 Could the freak be more vague?
6222258 6224511 I mean, as far as master plans go, John...
6224677 6228515 I can't wait for you to see. I really<br />can't. It's really going to be something.
6229599 6232310 Well, you know what?<br />I'm gonna be standing next to you.
6232477 6235730 So when this big thing happens,<br />you be sure and let me know.
6235897 6239401 -Because I wouldn't wanna miss it.<br />Oh, don't worry.
6239567 6240610 You won't.
6242612 6244739 You won't miss a thing.
6251329 6254624 With the tour bus itself,<br />give two miles separation.
6271391 6272725 What's so exciting?
6273935 6275854 It's not too far now.
6279566 6281317 High-tension lines ahead.
6281484 6282652 Prepare for frequency change.
6283278 6285572 I've been trying to figure something<br />in my head.
6285738 6288116 And maybe you can help me out, yeah?
6289534 6293705 When a person is insane,<br />as you clearly are...
6293872 6296207 do you know that you're insane?
6296374 6298793 Maybe you're sitting around,<br />reading Guns and Ammo...
6298960 6302213 masturbating in your own feces,<br />do you just stop and go:
6302380 6305884 "Wow, it is amazing how fucking crazy<br />I really am”?
6306217 6308553 Yeah? Do you guys do that?
6309387 6312056 It's more comfortable<br />for you to label me insane.
6312223 6313433 It's very comfortable.
6314225 6317562 It's not something I would expect<br />you to accept.
6317937 6320732 But I did not choose. I was chosen.
6321149 6324777 Well, whatever.<br />- I don't doubt that you believe that, John.
6325320 6329407 But seems to me that you're overlooking<br />a glaring contradiction.
6329574 6330825 Meaning what?
6332035 6333953 Glad you asked.
6335288 6336915 If you were chosen...
6337081 6340919 that is, by a higher power...
6341669 6343505 and if your hand was forced...
6344088 6347175 It seems strange to me<br />that you'd get such enjoyment out of it.
6347842 6350720 You enjoyed torturing those people.
6351429 6354933 This doesn't seem in keeping<br />with martyrdom, does it?
6356100 6357310 John?
6362148 6365026 I doubt I enjoyed it<br />any more than Detective Mills...
6365193 6368905 would enjoy time alone with me<br />in a room without windows.
6369489 6371282 Isn't that true?
6371616 6374536 How happy would it make you<br />to hurt me with impunity.
6374702 6375787 That hurts my feelings.
6377372 6380542 - I would never...<br />- You wouldn't because there's consequences.
6382043 6384671 It's in those eyes of yours, though.
6384837 6387507 Nothing wrong with a man<br />taking pleasure in his work.
6388258 6393179 I won't deny my own personal desire<br />to turn each sin against the sinner.
6394180 6397433 Wait a minute, I thought all you did<br />was kill innocent people.
6399435 6402021 Innocent? Is that supposed to be funny?
6402897 6404357 An obese man.
6404524 6407026 A disgusting man<br />who could barely stand up.
6407193 6411489 If you saw him, you'd point him out to your<br />friends so they'd join you in mocking him.
6411656 6413950 A man, who if you saw him<br />while you were eating...
6414117 6416661 you wouldn't be able<br />to finish your meal.
6416953 6420498 And after him, lawyer. You must've<br />secretly been thanking me for that one.
6420999 6423918 This is a man who dedicated his life...
6424085 6428715 to making money by lying<br />with every breath that he could muster...
6428881 6431759 to keeping murderers and rapists<br />on the streets.
6431926 6433344 - Murderers?<br />- A woman.
6433511 6435597 - Murderers, John, like yourself?<br />- A woman...
6435763 6438474 So ugly inside that she<br />couldn't bear to go on living...
6438641 6440935 if she couldn't be beautiful<br />on the outside?
6441102 6445523 A drug dealer.<br />A drug dealing pederast, actually.
6445690 6448359 And let's not forget<br />the disease-spreading whore.
6450612 6453031 Only in a world this shitty...
6453197 6456909 could you try to say these were<br />innocent people and keep a straight face.
6460121 6461998 But that's the point.
6463166 6466210 We see a deadly sin<br />on every street corner...
6466377 6469255 in every home and we tolerate it.
6469922 6472675 We tolerate it<br />because it's common, it's...
6472842 6474510 It's trivial.
6474677 6477639 We tolerate it morning, noon and night.
6480725 6482894 Well, not anymore.
6484896 6487273 I'm setting the example.
6488274 6489984 And what I've done is gonna be...
6490151 6491903 puzzled over...
6492070 6493905 and studied...
6494697 6496407 and followed...
6497909 6498951 forever.
6499744 6501537 Yeah.
6502413 6504749 Delusions of grandeur.
6505625 6507418 You should be thanking me.
6507919 6509128 Why's that, John?
6509295 6512423 Because you're going<br />to be remembered after this.
6512590 6516427 Realize, detective, the only reason<br />that I'm here right now...
6516594 6518638 Is that I wanted to be.
6518805 6521307 No. No, we would've got you eventually.
6521474 6522767 Oh, really?
6522934 6527188 So, what were you doing, biding your time?<br />Toying with me?
6527772 6533194 Allowing five innocent people to die<br />until you felt like springing your trap?
6533361 6537448 Tell me, what was the indisputable evidence<br />you were going to use on me...
6537615 6542078 right before I walked up to you<br />and put my hands in the air?
6542245 6544455 John, calm down.
6544622 6546999 I seem to remember us<br />knocking on your door.
6547333 6549168 Oh, that's right.
6549335 6552672 And I seem to remember<br />breaking your face.
6557427 6560263 You're only alive<br />because I didn't kill you.
6560430 6562390 - Okay, sit back.<br />- Ispared you.
6562557 6563599 Sit back.
6563766 6566060 Remember that every time<br />you look in the mirror...
6566227 6568938 at that face of yours<br />for the rest of your life...
6569105 6570773 or should I say for the rest...
6570940 6573317 of what life I allow you to have.<br />Sit back.
6573484 6577071 Sit back, you fucking freak.<br />Shut your fucking mouth.
6578698 6581451 You're no messiah.<br />You're a movie of the week.
6581617 6585204 You're a fucking T-shirt at best.
6598301 6600553 Don't ask me to pity those people.
6600720 6602138 I don't mourn them any more...
6602305 6604849 than the thousands that died<br />at Sodom and Gomorrah.
6605183 6609645 Is that to say, John, that what you<br />were doing was God's good work?
6612899 6616194 The Lord works in mysterious ways.
6618112 6620239 Do you see those high-tension towers?
6620698 6623034 That's where we're headed.<br />I see where.
6623201 6625536 Right to your 9 o'clock<br />and follow that access road.
6631876 6634045 Your signal's breaking up, Viking.
6634212 6637673 Un-fucking-avoidable, Center.<br />We're in power-line city, deal with it.
6639175 6642011 This sure as shit is no ambush out here.
6642178 6644931 - No fucking nothing out here.<br />- Can't land anywhere near.
6645097 6647934 They're gonna be coming up<br />behind us in about two minutes.
6648100 6650353 I want you to go up, way up.
6650520 6653648 Thirty seconds, bank east on my mark.<br />Thirty seconds.
6715710 6717461 I'm getting him out.
6719547 6721632 Target is now fully into standby.
6722466 6723467 Got you in sight.
6723634 6725052 Get out.
6725595 6727430 Slowly.
6727722 6729223 Stop.
6729765 6731309 Stay.
6734061 6735771 What do you got?
6736898 6738649 Dead dog.
6739942 6741485 I didn't do that.
6745156 6747325 We're holding on standby, copy?
6748326 6749410 What time is it?
6750328 6752914 - Why?<br />- I'd like to know.
6756292 6757376 Seven-oh-one.
6760671 6761756 It's close.
6762840 6764008 Let's go take a look.
6767762 6768804 It's this way.
6771849 6773893 Bird 2, close your distance.
6774060 6776604 This is Bird 2. They're away from the car.
6776771 6778940 Coming in closer.
6780816 6784195 We got them. We got them. Closing in.
6784362 6785988 Negative. Negative. Hold your go.
6811973 6813057 Mills?
6817311 6820356 Down, down, down.
6821357 6822858 Watch him.
6824110 6825945 There he goes.
6826153 6828322 It's good we have some time to talk.
6832410 6833828 Van approaching.
6833995 6837415 Stay on the guy in red. Do not take<br />the crosshairs off the guy in red.
6842044 6844672 He's going out<br />to meet the van. Just stay down.
6845131 6848300 There's a van coming down the road.<br />From the north.
6857476 6860062 Be ready for anything, now.<br />Wait for my signal.
6860229 6861856 Wait for me.
6867278 6869321 Get out of the van!
6870740 6871782 Out!
6871949 6874118 Jesus Christ, man. Don't shoot me.
6874285 6875953 Step away.
6876412 6878622 Turn around.<br />Put your hands on your head.
6878789 6880958 What the hell is going on?
6881125 6883919 What are you doing here?<br />- I'm delivering a package.
6884086 6885796 I got this package for this guy, David.
6885963 6889258 Uh, Detective David Mills.
6896223 6898559 Get it. Slowly.
6899435 6901979 Stay alert. He's opening<br />the back of the van.
6902146 6903814 We've got him in sight.
6910071 6913324 This guy paid me 500 bucks<br />to bring it out here, man.
6913491 6915576 He said he wanted it here at exactly 7:00.
6916327 6917828 Put it down.
6918454 6919789 We got a box.
6919955 6924251 We got a box. Call the bomb squad.<br />I need a bomb squad. We got a box.
6924710 6926420 Face the van.
6926796 6928255 Hands up.
6935679 6937306 Turn around.
6938182 6940101 Okay. Go. Off you go. Go.
6940267 6942394 Do you want us to pick this guy up?
6943312 6945314 I'm sending the driver out on foot.
6948192 6952154 Got the driver in sight.<br />- He's headed north. Have him picked up.
6961413 6963332 Oh, I don't know.
6969547 6971048 I'm gonna open it.
6971215 6975094 When I said I admired you,<br />I meant what I said.
6993737 6994822 It's blood.
6994989 6996740 You've made quite a life for yourself.
6996907 6997950 Hmm.
6998117 7001245 You should be very proud.<br />- Shut the fuck up, you piece of shit.
7014925 7016343 Someone lost contact, copy.
7028939 7030399 California, stay away from here.
7030566 7033027 Stay away from here, now.<br />Don't come in here.
7033485 7035196 Whatever you hear, stay away.
7036405 7039491 John Doe has the upper hand. Mills!
7039909 7041035 Here he comes.
7041202 7043078 Throw your gun down!<br />- What?
7043245 7045456 - I wish I could've lived like you.<br />- Shut up.
7045623 7048417 -What the fuck you talking about?<br />Go away!
7048584 7049877 Do you hear me, detective?
7050044 7054381 I'm trying to tell you how much<br />I admire you and your pretty wife.
7055466 7057301 - What?<br />- Tracy.
7057468 7058677 Mills!
7058844 7059929 What'd you fucking say?
7060095 7064183 It's disturbing how easily a member<br />of the press can purchase information...
7064350 7066060 from the men in your precinct.
7066560 7068062 What the fuck?
7068479 7070356 Throw your gun down!
7070522 7072566 I visited your home this morning...
7073567 7075361 After you'd left.
7075527 7077655 Mills!<br />- I tried to play husband.
7078322 7081575 I tried to taste the life of a simple man.
7081784 7083035 Throw it away!
7083202 7085496 Tsk, it didn't work out.
7085663 7087331 So...
7087498 7089416 I took a souvenir.
7091043 7092753 Her pretty head.
7092920 7094505 Mills.
7095047 7096674 Mills.
7097675 7098842 What's he talking about?
7099009 7101387 - Give me your gun.<br />- What's going on over there?
7101553 7102873 Put the, ugh... Put the gun down.
7103013 7105015 I saw you with a box.<br />What was in the box?
7105182 7108102 - Because I envy your normal life.<br />- Put the gun down, David.
7108269 7111230 - It seems that envy is my sin.<br />- Oh, what's in the box?
7111397 7113732 - Not until you give me the gun.<br />- What's in the box?
7113899 7115651 Give me the gun.<br />- He just told you.
7115818 7119446 -You lie. You're a fucking liar, shut up.<br />David.
7119613 7122366 That's what he wants.<br />He wants you to shoot him.
7122533 7125661 No! No.
7126036 7127830 You tell me that's not true.
7127997 7130124 - That's not true.<br />- Become vengeance, David.
7130291 7133168 - Oh, she's all right. You tell me.<br />- Become...
7133335 7135838 - wrath.<br />- Tell me she's all right!
7136005 7138132 - If you murder a suspect, David...<br />- No.
7138299 7140050 You throw it all away, he knows it.
7140217 7141218 No!
7141385 7143387 -She begged for her life.<br />Shut up.
7143554 7147224 She begged for her life<br />and for the life of the baby inside of her.
7163282 7164658 Oh.
7166577 7167786 He didn't know.
7181759 7183719 Give me the gun, David.
7188682 7190184 David.
7191477 7192895 If you kill him...
7194396 7196148 he will win.
7199860 7201695 Oh, God.
7201862 7204073 Oh, God.
7204782 7205949 Oh!
7219380 7221131 Oh, fuck, he shot him.
7243237 7245823 Set it down somewhere.
7247032 7249326 Come on, set us down.
7251745 7255541 Holy Christ. Somebody call somebody.
7255707 7257543 Call somebody.
7272015 7275060 Well, we'll take care of him.
7283735 7285779 Whatever he needs.
7286697 7288198 Where are you gonna be?
7290909 7292286 Around.
7296623 7298542 I'll be around.
7302421 7304673 Ernest Hemingway once wrote:
7304840 7309261 "The world is a fine place<br />and worth fighting for."”
7310095 7312681 I agree with the second part.
