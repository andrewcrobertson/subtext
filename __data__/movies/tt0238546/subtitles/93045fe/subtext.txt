90382 92717 There comes a time for every vampire...
92926 98139 When the idea of eternity<br />becomes momentarily unbearable.
98348 102560 Living and feeding in the shadows<br />with only your own company...
102770 106814 Rots into a solitary,<br />hollow existence.
107024 109609 Immortality seems like a good idea...
110068 113905 Until you realize you're<br />going to spend it alone.
114114 118659 So I slept, hoping the sounds of<br />the passing eras would fade out...
118911 121120 And a sort of death might happen.
121330 126042 But as I lay there, the world didn't<br />sound like the place I had left...
126502 129796 But something different.
130297 132423 Better....
163956 169293 It became worthwhile to rise again<br />as new gods were born and worshiped.
169503 172672 Night and day,<br />they were never alone.
172881 176717 I would become one of them.
205122 209333 Whether it was the meal or the<br />100 years of rest, I'm not sure.
209543 212920 But suddenly I was feeling<br />better than ever.
213213 215339 My senses so high...
215549 220344 They led me straight to the<br />instrument of my resurrection...
220554 224432 Playing in my old house.
253503 255421 Jesus.
256715 258299 Your voice....
258717 260176 Who the hell are you?
260385 264805 The question provoked an<br />irresistible urge.
265015 267934 I am the Vampire Lestat.
268143 270186 It just rolled out of my mouth.
270395 274106 With one sentence, I betrayed<br />everything about my kind.
274316 276317 Betrayed our code of secrecy.
276526 278569 Vampire?
279029 282365 That's funny.<br />Indeed.
282574 285076 Hilarious.
285994 287954 You're all...
288163 289872 So beautiful.
290457 294085 Your hands are...<br />Cold as death?
295170 297338 You're gonna kill us?<br />No.
297673 302468 All that you've ever dreamed of,<br />I'm going to make yours.
302678 305304 This is your lucky day.
305514 307890 It was a bold move, I admit.
308141 312478 But from that moment on they were<br />my friends, my children, my band.
312688 316273 Giving the world a new god. Me.

436978 439605 We go where we're told to,<br />like you.
439815 445111 How would you sum up your music?<br />Sex, blood and rock 'n' roll.
445779 447404 Okay, excuse me.
448740 450282 It's time.
450492 452159 May I present...
452369 456038 The Vampire Lestat.
460919 462169 Good evening.
463713 468425 Sorry I'm late. I was just<br />trying to catch my breakfast.
471179 474598 Okay, can we keep it short?<br />One at a time.
474933 476142 Yeah, you.
476560 480229 I may be wrong, but what<br />I remember about vampires is...
480438 483524 You generally keep your<br />identity secret.
483733 487153 Yes. But why hide it<br />in this day and age?
487362 490030 I've hidden in the shadows<br />for centuries.
490240 492992 It's time to share myself<br />with the world.
493535 498372 Could you prove it? You know, give<br />us a demonstration of your powers.
498582 503836 If you like, I can give you a private<br />demonstration in your hotel tonight.
507924 512261 Your first and only concert's<br />in Death Valley, just days away.
512512 515931 Why just the one?<br />I don't like repeating myself.
516141 520978 There are rumors about the<br />hidden meaning in your lyrics...
521188 524899 That you're giving away vampire<br />secrets. Something in all that?
525150 530529 Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few<br />old friends. Daring them to come out.
530739 535159 Won't these vampires be pissed off<br />that you're giving away secrets?
535869 539163 I imagine they are, yes.
539372 543000 Do you have anything to say<br />to the other vampires?
543210 546253 As a matter of fact, I do.
547839 552593 Come out, come out,<br />wherever you are.
554387 558015 See you all in Death Valley.
580121 584833 I heard Lestat keeps these girls<br />in his cellar. And it's nice.
585043 587753 They give you food and cable<br />and weed.
587963 589421 Please.
589673 594426 But you have to let him suck you<br />on your neck whenever he wants.
594636 597805 Doesn't sound too bad.<br />Done worse.
598014 599890 I'll say.<br />This way, Girls.
613446 616073 So this is Lestat's house?
616283 619618 It is this week.<br />We move around a lot.
619869 621328 Why is that?
622038 625291 What can I say? The guy is just....
626876 632423 Boss. I didn't see you there.<br />No. You wouldn't, would you?
635969 639388 Um, these are the girls<br />that you asked for.
640098 641640 Yes.
657324 660492 Do you want me to take<br />the girls home later?
660702 662870 No, thank you, Roger.
663079 665789 I'll make sure they're taken<br />care of.
668501 670544 You want some?
671546 673547 Want me?
674591 676342 You hungry?
680555 684058 You hungry for something else?
688229 690022 Come on.
690482 693984 Don't you want to have some fun?<br />Don't do that.
694277 696612 Are you ticklish?
696821 699490 I'm very ticklish.
765557 767724 Come out, come out...
767976 770394 Whoever you are.
778611 780320 Jesse.
782157 785325 Jesse.
785535 787077 A voice...
788037 790164 Calling to me...
790373 792458 In my dreams.
792667 796336 The same dream I've had since<br />I was 6.
796754 799590 I have a family of my own.
799924 802593 Not a strange dream, really.
802802 805512 One every orphan has.
833291 835125 I'm sorry, but you must go.
835335 839129 Why can't I stay with you?<br />Please, Aunt Maharet.
839339 842799 I don't want you to go.<br />But you must.
843259 846094 Aunt, you're bleeding.
852810 854770 You must be with your own.
854979 859691 I knew things were not normal.<br />This isn't the life for you.
859901 863987 I only knew I was part of them,<br />and being cast out.
864197 865447 Was I bad?
865657 867783 Had I done something wrong?
867992 870452 I'll always be watching over you.
870662 873121 I want to stay with you forever.

911661 913870 I'm Serena Altschul, MTV News.
914080 919001 Vampire turned Rocker Lestat has<br />returned with a new CD, Forsaken.
919210 921211 Although from New Orleans...
921421 924965 He claims to be an 18th century<br />French Nobleman...
925174 927843 Who has been asleep<br />for over 100 years.
928052 933890 Here's a look at the new video<br />from the debut album, Redeemer.
941107 947195 Give your life to my charms

969427 976600 ♪ The hunger inside given to<br />me, makes me what I am ♪

1002585 1005337 Like everyone, I assumed<br />Lestat was a joke.
1005546 1010676 A rock star with a gimmick. Then one<br />of his lyrics caught my attention.
1011010 1014262 "Take a walk down the aisle<br />at the end of the mile.
1014472 1017724 Give your life to my charms<br />in the Admiral's Arms."
1017934 1019476 That rang a bell.
1019686 1022312 I tracked down old leases in London.
1022522 1026692 It turns out in the late 1600s<br />there was a pub in Mile End...
1026901 1028777 Called the Admiral's Arms.
1028986 1032155 It had a reputation for<br />dealing with Black Magic...
1032365 1034950 And reports of people vanishing.
1035159 1040455 Here's where you could find the<br />Admiral's Arms in old London.
1040665 1043667 That part of London is mostly warehouses...
1043876 1048004 Meat packing plants and a<br />private club in the same location.
1049298 1052801 I think that it's a vampire coven.
1053010 1055762 And Lestat is leading us to it.
1057849 1060934 Who took this picture?<br />I did.
1061144 1064855 You're still an apprentice.<br />You don't do field work.
1065064 1066690 The Talamasca has a code.
1066899 1070527 I know. "Observe the dark realm,<br />but be not of it."
1070737 1073655 Well, it's held good for 12 centuries.
1073865 1077784 We record and observe,<br />but never interfere.
1077994 1080120 I had to see it for myself.
1083040 1085208 Is David aware of this?
1085752 1086793 Jesse?
1089338 1090380 Hello, David.
1091174 1094843 I was explaining...<br />Why don't you see me in my office?
1098097 1101266 This is a real coven.<br />In the middle of London.
1101476 1104853 All the more reason<br />to have told me first.
1106481 1108148 Listen, Jesse...
1111569 1114196 We know about Lestat.
1114614 1117407 What he's doing is unprecedented.
1118409 1119993 So why is he doing it?
1120203 1123789 Aren't you curious?<br />Don't you think we should find out?
1125208 1127375 Let me show you something.
1130463 1132380 What do you see?
1135092 1137719 Mid 1500s. Florence.
1138846 1140430 This one?
1144227 1147270 This man is in both.<br />Yes.
1149649 1151983 All the different paint samples...
1152693 1154569 All authentic.
1154779 1158448 Each painted at the time<br />of their particular style.
1164997 1167165 His name is Marius.
1168042 1170877 I've been tracing him for years.
1171337 1173421 My little obsession.
1173673 1176800 The closest we've come<br />to the original vampire.
1177093 1180720 Marius himself dates back to<br />400 B.C.
1184100 1186560 So he's older than Lestat.
1186769 1188937 He made Lestat.
1189647 1191022 How do you know that?
1191274 1194109 Because I have Lestat's journal.
1197530 1198947 I want to see it.
1201284 1204369 Promise me you'll never<br />go back to that place.
1235693 1239154 It was the winter of 1788.
1239363 1244326 And I was brought to a Mediterranean<br />Island by the man who made me.
1245703 1249372 If a man is what you'd call him.
1298881 1301299 Lestat, welcome.
1303386 1304803 Who are you?
1305054 1306972 Do I know you?
1309475 1313353 I am unknowable by nature,<br />but you may call me Marius.
1313562 1318400 I'm the lord of a great manor.<br />They'll send an army to look for me.
1318609 1321653 I doubt they'll find you,<br />Lord De Lioncourt.
1321862 1323863 You're a long way from home.
1353102 1354686 You're weak...
1358482 1361109 I can barely hear your heartbeat.
1362236 1367532 The future hastens.<br />An age beyond my antique reason.
1367742 1370702 You will help me understand<br />these times.
1371078 1373163 That's why I chose you.
1373539 1375123 Chose me for what?
1384967 1386426 Drink...
1386927 1388553 And live.
1389472 1392724 You've been brave enough<br />for one night, My Son.
1395478 1397687 Drink...
1399148 1401191 And learn.
1403486 1406112 Good, is it not?
1409909 1412494 No more. No more, Lestat.
1413913 1415789 No more!
1450116 1452534 Don't be afraid.
1452785 1455829 It's only your body that dies.
1470302 1472637 More.
1475015 1478518 I impressed my maker<br />with my thirst for things.
1478727 1481396 He set out to educate me<br />in the unknown.
1481605 1486192 Taught me all about the world,<br />its hidden history...
1486443 1488820 And about myself.
1494243 1496578 That's enough, My Son.
1499456 1502709 When you feed, hold back<br />from the moment of death.
1502918 1507505 Never take the last drop, or it<br />will draw you in and you will die.
1512928 1515263 Appreciate your prey.
1520394 1524689 Their blood that we take into<br />us carries with it life...
1524940 1529569 Their life, their knowledge,<br />their complexity.
1532615 1536159 My senses run amuck,<br />like a newborn child.
1536994 1542415 And as for my new powers, I was beside<br />myself with the pleasure of it all.
1544919 1546586 We've stayed long enough.
1546837 1548588 But we've spoken to no one.
1549131 1551925 A vampire's life is a life of discretion.
1552176 1553718 Discretion?
1554386 1556346 Why must we hide, Marius?
1556555 1559891 We are the powerful,<br />we are the immortal.
1560100 1563603 We should walk fearless<br />in the open, no?
1574281 1576532 That cannot be.
1577534 1580245 We're vulnerable during the day.
1580454 1584624 Mortals must never know about us,<br />for the sake of all our kind.
1585084 1587252 So I could never know her?
1587503 1589796 Not unless you wanted to kill her.
1597096 1598930 So I can never be known?
1601600 1604394 You must be dead to the world.
1605604 1607981 Come on, time to leave.
1668959 1671210 Sophia, run! Run!
1671545 1673963 Go! Go...
1674757 1676049 Lestat...
1676258 1678551 Stop her!
1679345 1680386 You must!
1718008 1721928 We must remain in the shadows.
1723305 1726891 You still have a few<br />lingering mortal emotions.
1727976 1731354 They'll serve you no good,<br />My Friend.
1743951 1745827 Forgive me.
1752876 1758965 The faces of my victims haunted<br />me, reminding me of my fate.
1759174 1761509 For nights and days I played...
1761718 1767432 Furious that I would never partake<br />of the simple joys of the world.
1767641 1769892 I was meant for more than this.
1809516 1811350 Marius?
1844468 1845927 Marius?
1892766 1895434 Would you like me to play for you?
2043417 2046043 What have you done, Lestat?
2055345 2059098 More!<br />I don't think so, My Lord.
2059307 2061308 Let me go.<br />No.
2061518 2065020 You've had the purest blood,<br />seen the oldest things.
2065230 2070651 Far too much for one as young as you.<br />Her blood is like liquid fire.
2070861 2072319 Who is she?
2077743 2079827 She's your mother.
2080036 2082079 She's my mother.
2082289 2086459 Akasha, the Queen of all<br />who are damned.
2087169 2089086 And he's her King.
2089546 2094717 Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this<br />earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.
2094926 2098888 They drank until Enkil<br />lost his will to drink.
2099097 2104018 Without her mate beside her, she also<br />lost hers. They became living statues.
2104227 2109899 She respects nothing except the taste<br />of blood, human and immortal alike.
2110233 2111776 No. Release me!
2117824 2120242 She made you quite powerful.
2120452 2122703 You'll not stop me!
2123914 2126791 Can I hear her blood in your voice?
2127626 2131128 In all the years of my care,<br />not once have they moved.
2131338 2135049 Until tonight. And she chose me.
2135967 2137551 I chose you.
2141598 2144934 Where are you going? Marius!
2174172 2175772 Marius?
2200156 2201699 Marius!
2202367 2208706 Many times since, I have called<br />to Marius. But there was no answer.
2209291 2213711 Just the endless procession<br />of days, months...
2213920 2215462 Years.
2216590 2220259 My teacher left me<br />to my darkest lesson.
2220468 2222636 That in the end, we are alone.
2223513 2229476 And there is nothing but the cold,<br />dark wasteland of eternity.
2254377 2257880 David thought the journal<br />would satisfy my curiosity.
2258506 2261675 But it only made me want to<br />know more.
2261885 2264553 I had to go back<br />to the Admiral's Arms.
2264763 2267181 I had no choice.

2375081 2376623 Hi.
2377500 2378959 Hi.<br />Come here often?
2379335 2381086 All the time.
2384924 2387760 I don't see any marks.
2387969 2390512 You haven't seen the rest of<br />my body.
2391556 2394099 Is that an invitation?
2394309 2396435 Sorry, I'm taken.
2396644 2398437 And...
2399105 2401190 Where is your host?
2401608 2402983 He's here somewhere.
2406654 2410324 This host, what's his name?
2414329 2415662 Marius.
2416498 2419208 Sorry, don't know the guy.
2419417 2423796 Of course not. He's an ancient.<br />There are no ancients left.
2424005 2426673 They all turned to dust.
2427050 2430260 So unless you've got him<br />in a bottle somewhere....
2430470 2433472 You're brave to joke.<br />I wish you could meet him.
2433681 2437351 And why is that?<br />Because you might learn something.
2440772 2442815 Excuse me.
2457163 2458831 Going somewhere?
2460750 2463752 Now this will only hurt a<br />little bit.
2464129 2467965 In fact, you might even enjoy it.
2468174 2469216 Don't do this.
2506880 2510257 That was quite a performance.
2510884 2513677 You should be more careful.
2514762 2518056 Thanks.<br />For what?
2518391 2520225 You saved me.
2520935 2522936 How presumptuous.
2523813 2527357 So you know Marius?
2529611 2531278 I know a lot of things.
2531487 2534198 Not how to stay alive, apparently.
2534490 2536658 I guess we have that in common.
2537202 2540120 Although I'm a little ahead<br />of the race here.
2540330 2542915 Well, I can fix that.
2543499 2547836 Your song "Redeemer" is about the<br />girl with the violin. Isn't it?
2549547 2550714 Yeah.
2550965 2552382 Is it?
2555303 2557596 What else do you think you know?
2560141 2562601 You're shaking.
2562810 2564228 Cold.
2565230 2566772 Still cold?
2566981 2572277 So.... Go on.<br />Tell me more about me.
2572528 2574154 You want....
2574364 2576323 What do I want?
2577700 2581161 You yearn.<br />What do I yearn?
2584540 2587292 For what do I yearn?
2587502 2589628 To walk with the living.
2591172 2595634 Out of the cold,<br />dark wasteland of eternity.
2599180 2600222 Well...
2602642 2605978 That makes you a very clever librarian.
2606187 2608689 Talamasca.
2608898 2612442 I knew I left that journal somewhere.
2615238 2619157 Was it a good read?<br />It touched me.
2619742 2621368 Did it, now?
2622870 2624663 Don't worry, Jesse.
2625164 2627708 Your kind never satisfies my thirst.
2630712 2634089 Lestat, I know something<br />that's not in your journal.
2636676 2637718 What?
2638177 2640637 You still have the violin,<br />don't you?
2641306 2643348 No, I understand.
2644309 2646059 After all, it's only human.
2702742 2704743 Clever librarian.
2714962 2718882 David, listen, I'm going to<br />Los Angeles for the concert.
2719550 2722594 I met him, David. I talked to Lestat.
2722929 2725097 What? Jesse?
2725306 2728850 Listen to me very carefully now.
2730520 2733397 You are no longer seeing<br />things clearly.
2733689 2737484 Lestat told the world that vampires<br />live among us. They're mad.
2737693 2742155 They'll be at the concert to kill him.<br />You've become obsessed with it.
2742365 2747160 I'm worried about you.<br />Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.
2747370 2749246 I'll check in and....
2750289 2751915 I'm sorry. I have to go.
2752125 2753708 No, Jesse...
2770560 2774521 The city of Lost Angels already<br />fed on the blood of youth.
2774730 2777941 My presence here barely<br />stirred a ripple.
2778151 2780569 We had three days till the concert.
2780778 2783280 I could feel something was coming.
2783489 2786658 I just couldn't figure out what.
2792707 2795584 And I've got nothing to elevate
2799380 2802632 I can't seem to concentrate
2805511 2808972 'Cause I've got nothing to consecrate
2819484 2821026 Marius.
2833039 2834831 Lestat.
2836209 2838627 It is good to see you, Lestat.
2840004 2841296 And you.
2841547 2845217 Still wearing the old fashions,<br />I see.
2846969 2849179 Old habits die hard.
2849388 2854518 How did you manage to slip<br />through the '50s in red velvet?
2855186 2856686 I slept.
2858022 2860315 Don't think you missed much.
2861484 2865195 Elvis.<br />Elvis, yes.
2867406 2869491 You're bigger than he is now.
2869825 2870867 So....
2871744 2873870 After all this time...
2874413 2876331 What's the occasion?
2876541 2882045 You've just become very hard to avoid<br />these days, at least in conversation.
2883047 2886591 What are you trying to prove, Lestat?<br />Please.
2886801 2890971 It's a little too late to come<br />over all paternal now, Marius.
2891180 2894975 Two hundred years<br />and not a word from you.
2896227 2899354 You almost cost me everything.
2902233 2903858 Now you've done it again.
2904527 2908029 This isn't the time to settle<br />old scores.
2909740 2912784 Vampires don't settle old scores.
2914912 2917289 We harbor them.
2921627 2923420 How did you find me?
2923921 2925338 I made you.
2925631 2927966 I've always known where you are.
2928801 2930218 Besides...
2930595 2934889 I just had to look for the most<br />gauche house on the block.
2936517 2941563 Come. Let me show you what it<br />means to live in the light.
2950323 2951573 Impressive.
2951782 2956161 Reminds me of old mad Druids running<br />around chanting in the forest.
2956370 2958455 A return to the primitive.
2959081 2961124 Out there, my fans...
2962418 2964044 They worship me.
2964420 2969549 Millions of arms reach out to embrace,<br />beg me to come into their lives.
2969759 2971718 It's what you always wanted.
2971927 2974596 With all my black little heart.
2975931 2979267 Did you think of anyone but yourself?
2979685 2982979 I only have myself.<br />You taught me that.
2983689 2987067 It may be time to get ready<br />for some company.
2987276 2992906 What's that supposed to mean?<br />Your music's woken an old friend.
2994825 2996451 Can't you hear it?
2996952 3000538 Or is the applause all you<br />can hear now?
3019642 3020975 Akasha.
3021769 3023436 Arisen.
3024063 3026898 She has taken the king's blood.
3027108 3029025 Absorbed his power.
3029652 3032779 Good. Let her come.
3033072 3035240 Cancel the concert.
3035533 3036908 Never.
3037451 3041413 You're no match for her, Lestat.<br />You're not a god.
3042123 3044916 We were once mortals too.
3045918 3048712 It is our heritage we protect.
3048921 3051715 Such reverence for mortals.
3051924 3054926 Then you should have left me<br />as one.
3115613 3120950 Scent is fading.<br />He was here too long ago.
3121160 3122869 You like him, do you?
3123996 3126039 He reminds me of someone.
3126248 3130960 All he's going to remind you<br />of soon is a pile of bones.
3131170 3134297 We're going to dismember him.<br />Bleed him dry.
3134507 3135673 Really?
3136967 3140386 Is that what you're going to do?
3318691 3322193 Old gods on new streets.
3322695 3326155 Not only had the concert sold<br />out among the living...
3326365 3329492 It seemed all the undead<br />were coming too.
3329702 3332537 There would be angry vampires<br />out there...
3332746 3336916 Frightened of the light I was<br />directing on all our kind.
3337167 3340670 Do you have anything to say<br />to the other vampires?
3340879 3344716 Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.
3345676 3349053 Come out, come out,<br />wherever you are.
3349847 3351889 They wanted me dead.
3352099 3353808 Let them try.
3354143 3355601 Bring it on.
3356020 3358813 Better dead than alone.
3374496 3377040 Hey, Honey. Want tickets for tomorrow?
3377249 3379042 Going to the show?<br />No.
3379251 3382962 Come on, I got them for $200.<br />$200? I don't think so.
3383172 3389052 What if I say 150?<br />150? You're gonna cut me a deal?
3389303 3393473 So, listen, just two girls, okay?<br />So how old are you again?
3396435 3399729 Check it out. Champagne?<br />Yeah.
3416872 3422001 Oh, my God, I can't believe it's<br />really you! I'm your biggest fan.
3424046 3425421 Boo.
3426381 3427673 Boo back.
3428592 3431219 Lestat, I came all the way<br />from Tarzana.
3431428 3432512 Really?
3433514 3435181 And you?<br />London.
3436433 3438976 A London Goth. I see.
3440104 3444816 It's funny, I would have<br />pegged you for a Talamascan.
3445776 3447652 Maybe in another life.
3447861 3449487 I'm an Episcopalian.
3449988 3453449 And I'm a frigging Buddhist.<br />Uh, Lestat....
3453659 3457995 Roger, would you take our little<br />Episcopalian back to church?
3458205 3460706 Just the one tonight? Sure.
3460916 3464168 Sweetheart, come on.<br />What?
3464837 3466504 Come on.<br />What?
3466713 3469882 It's a good thing.<br />Can I still go backstage?
3471635 3474178 Why are you following me?
3474429 3475888 What do you want?
3489361 3493698 So you come all this way<br />just to return this to me?
3493907 3496826 Out of the goodness of your heart?
3499496 3502165 I want you to show me what<br />it's like.
3502541 3505668 What what is like, exactly?
3505878 3508087 To be like you.
3511049 3513176 I don't have time for this.
3513552 3517805 All a vampire has is time.<br />Not this one.
3519766 3520975 Right.
3521226 3523895 The covens are coming for you.
3524104 3528774 How are you going to spend your last<br />night, as you always have, alone?
3528984 3530193 Why not?
3530903 3533321 Why not share it with me?
3537201 3538701 All right.
3541455 3544790 This may be painful for a mortal.
3545000 3548169 You're still attached to your skin.
3549213 3550922 I don't care.
3553508 3555343 Do you trust me?
3559097 3560640 Yes.
3569816 3572151 Then close your eyes.
3649521 3651480 Marius was right.
3651690 3654859 But I never understood<br />until I met you.
3655485 3657486 What do you mean?
3657696 3660990 You're beautiful to me<br />because you're human.
3661199 3663367 Your frailty...
3663618 3665578 Your short years...
3667998 3669707 Your heart...
3669916 3672710 Even as you think it's breaking.
3677090 3678883 All that...
3680302 3684972 Seems suddenly more precious<br />than anything I have ever known.
3688226 3691062 I'm not as precious as you think.
3700530 3701947 Do it.
3705577 3707036 Please.
3713293 3715586 Let me be with you.
3717839 3720424 Let me know everything.
3728558 3731102 You want to know everything?
3733188 3734772 Come, then.
3735065 3736899 I'll show you.
3759297 3762883 What is it?<br />What are we doing...?
3807637 3809180 Is she all right?
3813518 3816729 Get away! Get off me!
3825363 3827031 Now you see?
3827574 3828991 Are you ready?
3830785 3834038 Now do you want it, huh?
3837125 3838250 No.
3838710 3841378 Of course you don't.
3900647 3903440 They're pretty worked up.<br />How you feeling?
3903650 3905401 Hey, Girls, come on!
3906611 3909822 Okay, through here. Let him through!
3910198 3911615 Back off, Fella!
3911825 3913242 Come on, Children.
3913451 3915619 Okay, Guys. Come on!
3917956 3919999 Let him through.

3929551 3930801 Jesse!
3934681 3936140 Hello, David.

4403941 4405984 Akasha?
4406569 4409112 Why so surprised, My Love?
4409906 4411948 You called, I have come.
4413034 4414117 My love?
4414619 4417162 Never fear me, Lestat.
4418247 4420457 All your wishes have come true.
4420666 4422292 My wishes?
4424504 4428131 For a companion to share eternity.
4430635 4434513 You're bold, like your music.
4436390 4441353 You live your life in the open,<br />like I did long ago...
4442480 4444272 When I had a King.
4444816 4445941 Had a King?
4446359 4448068 He's no more.
4448861 4452322 Now you are my consort.
4453282 4455450 That's why I kept you safe.
4456577 4458161 Alive.
4459122 4460622 You?
4462375 4465168 You thought it was all you?
4468297 4471341 The ego of a King as well.
4471592 4473093 Yes.
4474345 4477681 I know you, Lestat.
4478099 4482185 I know that you crave to have<br />the world at your feet.
4483646 4487107 And I have come to give it to you.
4489026 4491027 Where are we?
4491863 4493822 We are home.
4494365 4499619 We live everywhere<br />and anywhere we choose.
4500037 4503748 The world is our garden.
4648561 4652689 All these years I'd hoped<br />this place was real.
4654859 4660196 For the first time in my life,<br />I feel like I'm home.
4660781 4664826 Strange that this journey<br />should lead me here.
4665036 4668288 This place that's haunted my dreams.
4673669 4676504 Aunt, you're bleeding.
4676714 4678923 You must be with your own.
4681552 4684054 I'll always be watching over you.
4684305 4687015 I want to stay with you forever.
4688225 4690727 Forever is a very long time.
4694065 4695732 Aunt Maharet.
4705743 4709329 You haven't aged,<br />you haven't changed at all.
4712249 4714626 I was once a mortal too.
4714919 4719005 I bore a child before Akasha took me.<br />I took care of that child...
4719215 4722926 And her children,<br />and her children's children.
4723427 4725678 This is our family.
4725888 4728473 My way of coping with eternity.
4730518 4735355 You are what keeps me connected<br />to the world of the living.
4735981 4740110 When your parents died, I brought<br />you here to take care of you.
4745616 4748410 Now is not the time.
4749787 4753581 You were seeking answers<br />and now you've found them.
4753958 4757710 The family is who you are.
4848719 4852847 Drinking my blood allows you<br />to live in the light.
4853057 4858019 And soon the sun will no<br />longer sting your eyes.
4859230 4863775 This is but a taste<br />of what we shall share, My Love.
4864860 4866569 My King...
4867404 4870281 Behold our kingdom.
4870950 4873326 A kingdom of corpses?
4875329 4878748 Why?<br />Why not?
4879416 4881167 This is why you have risen?
4881377 4884712 They believed in nothing.
4885089 4886673 Now they are nothing.
4893305 4896391 But you and I,<br />we will change all that.
4897601 4902313 We will give the world<br />something to believe in again.
4903482 4905567 Now come, My Love.
4905943 4908027 We have a score to settle.
4920165 4922792 Since my mortal death,<br />I have watched...
4923502 4927797 I have guided and cared<br />for my human family...
4928340 4931217 Generations beyond memory.
4933304 4936973 This is why we must fight Akasha.
4938309 4943146 For the sake of your great family.<br />The world we know will end.
4943480 4947483 The only way to prevent this<br />is through Akasha's destruction.
4947693 4949193 But how?
4949778 4952363 When she gives blood,<br />she's vulnerable.
4952573 4956492 Whoever takes the last of her<br />blood will not survive it.
4956702 4958328 What about Lestat?
4958537 4964500 Lestat has joined with Akasha.<br />He's lost to us now. Forget him.
4987191 4988775 My children.
4990944 4994072 It warms my blood<br />to see you all gathered...
4994531 4996115 Plotting against me.
4996325 4998743 Akasha.<br />Maharet.
4999578 5004415 You will address my king first.<br />Lestat, what has she done to you?
5007044 5009587 Lestat, step aside.
5010047 5011089 Never.
5011298 5013883 The world has changed<br />since you reigned.
5014093 5016260 Then we shall change it back.
5016553 5018721 Humans are animals...
5019390 5021391 Brute creatures.
5021600 5026771 Their destruction can only make sense.<br />We've found other ways to coexist.
5026980 5031359 In silence! In shadows and shame!<br />And for what?
5031568 5033569 For respect of mortals?
5033779 5035863 They are nothing to us.
5036073 5037949 They are merely food.
5038784 5040159 Akasha, please....
5040369 5043413 You think you can change my will?
5044081 5047041 I've had enough of this discussion.
5047251 5048793 Join me or die.
5049253 5050878 I will not.
5051088 5052880 I will not.<br />I will not.
5053090 5054674 I will not.
5062850 5064308 Do you love me?
5066186 5068896 Yes.<br />Then prove it.
5071024 5072442 Kill her.
5073527 5076612 She's nothing to me.<br />Just the same...
5077614 5079949 I'd like for you to kill her.
5083829 5088875 You will not touch her!<br />You still think to challenge me?
5092212 5096174 Now.<br />No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.
5096967 5098926 It's what I want.
5105309 5107477 How sweet.
5113650 5115234 I'm ready.
5192062 5194146 See, my children?
5195315 5197900 Remember your real family!
5199236 5200862 Or join hers.
5202114 5203698 Now...
5209121 5211289 Spoken like a true King.
5214459 5216127 Come.
5226263 5229682 You see how he obeys?
5230100 5231434 You will...
5232436 5235062 Or you will all die.
5240777 5242612 That is enough, Lestat.
5252539 5254457 That is enough, Lestat! Stop!
5322567 5325027 You kill me...
5325237 5328280 You kill yourselves.
5373368 5375161 Wait, Lestat.
5377956 5379415 You must stop.
5534404 5537615 She drank Akasha's last drop.
5539034 5542912 She took Akasha's death into herself.
5544289 5545956 She's not dead.
5546875 5549001 She sleeps.
5607602 5609311 Hello?
5641928 5643679 Oh, my God!
5644514 5646056 Jesse?
5647183 5648642 Hello, David.
5660322 5662448 David, this is Lestat.
5663033 5667036 Hello.<br />I have something for you.
5670915 5672666 I believe...
5672959 5675669 That you wanted this back.
5677797 5681592 Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
5691895 5693729 Can I ask...?<br />What's it like?
5693897 5694938 Yes.
5695357 5697649 Do you want to find out?
5698651 5700152 Me?
5700362 5702988 No, I'm too old to live forever.
5703323 5706241 Well, if you ever change your mind....
5709079 5710871 So this is goodbye.
5711831 5713165 Yes.
5772392 5774393 Hello, David.
