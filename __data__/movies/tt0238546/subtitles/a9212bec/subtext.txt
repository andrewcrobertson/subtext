89405 91805 <i>There comes a time</i><br /><i>for every vampire...</i>
91975 97242 <i>... when the idea of eternity becomes</i><br /><i>momentarily unbearable.</i>
97447 101645 <i>Living and feeding in the shadows</i><br /><i>with only your own company...</i>
101851 105844 <i>... rots into a solitary,</i><br /><i>hollow existence.</i>
106055 108683 <i>Immortality seems like a good idea...</i>
109125 112993 <i>... until you realize</i><br /><i>you're going to spend it alone.</i>
113196 117724 <i>So I slept, hoping the sounds</i><br /><i>of the passing eras would fade out...</i>
117967 120162 <i>... and a sort of death might happen.</i>
120370 125034 <i>But as I lay there, the world didn't</i><br /><i>sound like the place I had left...</i>
125542 128773 <i>... but something different.</i>
129345 131438 <i>Better...</i>
163012 168314 <i>It became worthwhile to rise again</i><br /><i>as new gods were born and worshiped.</i>
168518 171715 <i>Night and day, they were never alone.</i>
171921 175721 <i>I would become one of them.</i>
204153 208351 <i>Whether it was the meal or</i><br /><i>the 100 years of rest, I'm not sure.</i>
208558 211959 <i>But suddenly</i><br /><i>I was feeling better than ever.</i>
212228 214321 <i>My senses so high...</i>
214530 219365 <i>... they led me straight to the</i><br /><i>instrument of my resurrection...</i>
219569 223505 <i>... playing in my old house.</i>
252535 254469 Jesus.
255738 257330 Your voice...
257774 259207 Who the hell are you?
259409 263846 <i>The question provoked</i><br /><i>an irresistible urge.</i>
264047 266982 I am the vampire Lestat.
267183 269242 <i>It just rolled out of my mouth.</i>
269452 273115 <i>With one sentence,</i><br /><i>I betrayed everything about my kind.</i>
273323 275348 <i>Betrayed our code of secrecy.</i>
275558 277617 Vampire?
278061 281394 - That's funny.<br />- Indeed.
281631 284122 Hilarious.
285034 287002 You're all...
287203 288898 ...so beautiful.
289439 293102 - Your hands are...<br />- Cold as death?
294210 296371 - You're gonna kill us?<br />- No.
296679 301514 All that you've ever dreamed of,<br />I'm going to make yours.
301718 304346 This is your lucky day.
304554 306920 <i>It was a bold move, I admit.</i>
307123 311526 <i>But from that moment on they were</i><br /><i>my friends, my children, my band.</i>
311728 315289 <i>Giving the world a new god.</i><br /><i>Me.</i>
426442 432039 Okay, can I have your attention?<br />Okay, some questions. One at a time.
433249 435809 - Yeah, you.<br />- So why here in London?
436018 438612 We go where we're told to, like you.
438821 444123 - How would you sum up your music?<br />- Sex, blood and rock and roll.
444760 446455 Okay, excuse me.
447763 449287 It's time.
449499 451160 May I present...
451367 455064 ...the vampire Lestat.
459976 461204 <i>Good evening.</i>
462712 467445 <i>Sorry I'm late. I was just trying</i><br /><i>to catch my breakfast.</i>
470219 473655 Okay, can we keep it short?<br />One at a time.
473923 475117 Yeah, you.
475591 479254 I may be wrong, but what<br />I remember about vampires is...
479428 482522 ...you generally keep<br />your identity secret.
482732 486224 <i>Yes. But why hide it</i><br /><i>in this day and age?</i>
486402 489064 <i>I've hidden in the shadows</i><br /><i>for centuries.</i>
489272 492002 <i>It's time to share myself</i><br /><i>with the world.</i>
492575 497410 Could you prove it? You know, give us<br />a demonstration of your powers.
497613 502880 <i>If you like, I can give you a private</i><br /><i>demonstration in your hotel tonight.</i>
506956 511290 Your first and only concert's<br />in Death Valley, just days away.
511494 514952 - Why just the one?<br /><i>- I don't like repeating myself.</i>
515164 520033 There are rumors about<br />the hidden meaning in your lyrics...
520203 523934 ...that you're giving away<br />vampire secrets. Is that true?
524140 529578 <i>Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few</i><br /><i>old friends. Daring them to come out.</i>
529779 534216 Won't these vampires be pissed off<br />that you're giving away secrets?
534850 538217 <i>I imagine they are, yes.</i>
538421 542016 Do you have anything to say<br />to the other vampires?
542225 545285 <i>As a matter of fact, I do.</i>
546862 551629 <i>Come out, come out, wherever you are.</i>
553402 557031 <i>See you all in Death Valley.</i>
579161 583894 I heard Lestat keeps all these girls<br />in his cellar. And it's nice.
584100 586762 They give you food<br />and cable and weed.
586969 588459 Oh, please.
588671 593472 But you have to let him suck you<br />on your neck whenever he wants.
593676 596839 - Doesn't sound too bad.<br />- Done worse.
597046 598946 - I'll say.<br />- This way, girls.
612495 615123 So this is Lestat's house?
615331 618664 It is this week. We move around a lot.
618868 620358 Why is that?
621070 624301 What can I say? The guy is just...
625908 631403 - Boss. I didn't see you there.<br />- No. You wouldn't, would you?
634984 638420 These are the girls<br />that you asked for.
639121 640679 Yes.
656372 659535 Do you want me to take<br />the girls home later?
659742 661903 No, thank you, Roger.
662111 664773 I'll make sure they're taken care of.
667550 669575 You want some?
670586 672577 Want me?
673589 675318 You hungry?
679562 683089 You hungry for something else?
687269 688998 Come on.
689505 692963 - Don't you want to have some fun?<br />- Don't do that.
693309 695675 Are you ticklish?
695878 698540 I'm very ticklish.
764613 766774 Come out, come out...
766982 769416 ...whoever you are.
777593 779356 <i>Jesse.</i>
781197 784360 <i>Jesse.</i>
784567 786125 <i>A voice...</i>
787036 789197 <i>... calling to me...</i>
789405 791498 <i>... in my dreams.</i>
791707 795370 <i>The same dream I've had</i><br /><i>since I was 6.</i>
795778 798645 <i>I have a family of my own.</i>
798948 801610 <i>Not a strange dream, really.</i>
801817 804547 <i>One every orphan has.</i>
832314 834179 I'm sorry, but you must go.
834383 838183 Why can't I stay with you?<br />Please, Aunt Maharet.
838387 841845 I don't want you to go. But you must.
842291 845124 Aunt, you're bleeding.
851834 853859 You must be with your own.
854069 858733 <i>- I knew things were not normal.</i><br /><i>- This isn't the life I wanted for you.</i>
858941 863037 <i>I only knew I was part of them,</i><br /><i>and being cast out...</i>
863245 864542 <i>Was I bad?</i>
864747 866840 <i>Had I done something wrong?</i>
867049 869540 I'll always be watching over you.
869752 872220 I want to stay with you forever.
872421 874946 You can't.
910726 912921 <i>I'm Serena Altschul, MTV News.</i>
913128 918065 <i>Vampire turned rocker Lestat</i><br /><i>has returned with a new CD,</i> Forsaken.
918267 920258 <i>Although from New Orleans...</i>
920469 924064 <i>... he claims to be an 18th-century</i><br /><i>French nobleman...</i>
924239 926935 <i>... who has been asleep</i><br /><i>for over 100 years.</i>
927142 932910 <i>Here's a look at the new video</i><br /><i>from the debut album, "Redeemer."</i>
1001617 1004415 <i>Like everyone, I assumed</i><br /><i>Lestat was a joke.</i>
1004620 1009751 A rock star with a gimmick. Then one<br />of his lyrics caught my attention.
1010092 1013323 "Take a walk down the aisle<br />at the end of the mile.
1013495 1016828 Give your life to my charms<br />in the Admiral's Arms."
1017032 1018556 That rang a bell.
1018767 1021395 I tracked down old leases in London.
1021603 1025767 It turns out in the late 1600s<br />there was a pub in Mile End...
1025941 1027841 ...called the Admiral's Arms.
1028043 1031240 It had a reputation for dealing<br />with black magic...
1031447 1034007 ...and reports of people vanishing.
1034216 1039552 Here's where you could find<br />the Admiral's Arms in old London.
1039755 1042747 That part of London<br />is mostly warehouses...
1042958 1047088 ...meat-packing plants and<br />a private club in the same location.
1048397 1051833 I think that it's a vampire coven.
1052034 1054832 And Lestat is leading us to it.
1056905 1059999 - Who took this picture?<br />- I did.
1060209 1063940 You're still an apprentice.<br />You don't do field work.
1064146 1065773 The Talamasca has a code.
1065981 1069610 I know. "Observe the dark realm,<br />but be not of it."
1069818 1072753 Well, it's held good for 12 centuries.
1072955 1076891 We record and observe,<br />but never interfere.
1077092 1079185 I had to see it for myself.
1082097 1084292 Is David aware of this?
1084833 1085857 Jesse?
1088437 1089426 Hello, David.
1090205 1093936 - I was explaining...<br />- Why don't you see me in my office?
1097179 1100342 This is a real coven.<br />In the middle of London.
1100549 1103882 All the more reason<br />to have told me first.
1105554 1107181 Listen, Jesse...
1110659 1113219 ...we know about Lestat.
1113695 1116425 What he's doing is unprecedented.
1117466 1119058 So why is he doing it?
1119268 1122863 Aren't you curious?<br />Don't you think we should find out?
1124306 1126433 Let me show you something.
1129545 1131445 What do you see?
1134149 1136811 Mid-1500s. Florence.
1137920 1139478 This one?
1143292 1146352 - This man is in both.<br />- Yes.
1148697 1151063 All the different paint samples...
1151733 1153633 ...all authentic.
1153836 1157465 Each painted at the time<br />of their particular style.
1164079 1166240 His name is Marius.
1167115 1169948 I've been tracing him for years.
1170419 1172512 My little obsession.
1172721 1175849 The closest we've come<br />to the original vampire.
1176124 1179787 Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C.
1183131 1185656 So he's older than Lestat.
1185868 1188029 He made Lestat.
1188737 1190102 How do you know that?
1190305 1193172 Because I have Lestat's journal.
1196578 1198045 I want to see it.
1200382 1203442 Promise me you'll never<br />go back to that place.
1234783 1238241 <i>It was the winter of 1788.</i>
1238453 1243413 <i>And I was brought to a Mediterranean</i><br /><i>island by the man who made me.</i>
1244726 1248457 <i>If a man is what you'd call him.</i>
1297980 1300346 Lestat, welcome.
1302451 1303884 Who are you?
1304086 1306020 Do I know you?
1308557 1312459 I am unknowable by nature,<br />but you may call me Marius.
1312661 1317462 I'm the lord of a great manor.<br />They'll send an army to look for me.
1317666 1320692 I doubt they'll find you,<br />Lord de Lioncourt.
1320902 1322893 You're a long way from home.
1352134 1353761 You're weak...
1354269 1355736 ...near passing.
1357539 1360167 I can barely hear your heartbeat.
1361276 1366578 The future hastens.<br />An age beyond my antique reason.
1366782 1369751 You will help me understand<br />these times.
1370152 1372245 That's why I chose you.
1372621 1374145 Chose me for what?
1384066 1385465 Drink...
1386001 1387593 ...and live.
1388570 1391801 You've been brave enough<br />for one night, my son.
1394543 1396704 Drink...
1398213 1400204 ...and learn.
1402584 1405178 Good, is it not?
1408990 1411515 No more. No more, Lestat.
1412994 1414859 No more!
1449197 1451597 Don't be afraid.
1451867 1454893 It's only your body that dies.
1469384 1471716 More.
1474055 1477616 <i>I impressed my maker</i><br /><i>with my thirst for things.</i>
1477826 1480454 <i>He set out to educate me</i><br /><i>in the unknown.</i>
1480629 1485259 <i>Taught me all about the world,</i><br /><i>its hidden history...</i>
1485467 1487867 <i>... and about myself.</i>
1493341 1495673 That's enough, my son.
1498547 1501812 When you feed, hold back<br />from the moment of death.
1502017 1506579 Never take the last drop, or it will<br />draw you in and you will die.
1512027 1514325 Appreciate your prey.
1519467 1523767 Their blood that we take into us<br />carries with it life...
1523972 1528636 ...their life, their knowledge,<br />their complexity.
1531680 1535241 <i>My senses run amuck,</i><br /><i>like a newborn child.</i>
1536084 1541488 <i>And as for my new powers, I was beside</i><br /><i>myself with the pleasure of it all.</i>
1543992 1545653 We've stayed long enough.
1545860 1547657 But we've spoken to no one.
1548230 1550994 A vampire's life<br />is a life of discretion.
1551199 1552791 Discretion?
1553468 1555436 Why must we hide, Marius?
1555637 1558970 We are the powerful,<br />we are the immortal.
1559174 1562666 We should walk fearless<br />in the open, no?
1573388 1575652 That cannot be.
1576658 1579354 We're vulnerable during the day.
1579561 1583691 Mortals must never know about us,<br />for the sake of all our kind.
1584199 1586360 So I could never know her?
1586568 1588900 Not unless you wanted to kill her.
1596211 1598042 So I can never be known?
1600715 1603513 You must be dead to the world.
1604719 1607085 Come on, time to leave.
1668083 1670347 Sophia, run! Run!
1670685 1673051 Go! Go...
1673888 1675150 Lestat...
1675357 1677655 ...stop her!
1678426 1679484 You must!
1717098 1721000 We must remain in the shadows.
1722437 1725998 You still have a few<br />lingering mortal emotions.
1727108 1730441 They'll serve you no good, my friend.
1743024 1744958 Forgive me.
1752000 1758064 <i>The faces of my victims haunted me,</i><br /><i>reminding me of my fate.</i>
1758273 1760639 <i>For nights and days I played...</i>
1760842 1766576 <i>... furious that I would never partake</i><br /><i>of the simple joys of the world.</i>
1766781 1768976 <i>I was meant for more than this.</i>
1808590 1810490 Marius?
1891906 1894534 Would you like me to play for you?
2042557 2045151 What have you done, Lestat?
2054469 2058166 - More!<br />- I don't think so, my little lord.
2058406 2060431 - Let me go.<br />- No.
2060641 2064099 You've had the purest blood,<br />seen the oldest things.
2064312 2069773 - Far too much for one as young as you.<br />- Her blood is like liquid fire.
2069984 2071383 Who is she?
2076824 2078951 She's your mother.
2079160 2081219 She's my mother.
2081429 2085593 Akasha, the queen of all<br />who are damned.
2086234 2088168 And he's her king.
2088669 2093868 Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this<br />earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.
2094041 2098034 They drank until Enkil<br />lost his will to drink.
2098212 2103172 Without her mate beside her, she also<br />lost hers. They became living statues.
2103351 2108983 She respects nothing except the taste<br />of blood, human and immortal alike.
2109357 2110881 No. Release me!
2116964 2119364 She made you quite powerful.
2119534 2121764 You'll not stop me!
2123037 2125904 Can I hear her blood in your voice?
2126707 2130234 In all the years of my care,<br />not once have they moved.
2130444 2134141 Until tonight. And she chose me.
2135049 2136676 I chose you.
2140721 2144054 Where are you going?! Marius!
2201482 2207819 <i>Many times since, I have called</i><br /><i>to Marius. But there was no answer.</i>
2208356 2212850 <i>Just the endless procession</i><br /><i>of days, months...</i>
2213027 2214551 <i>... years.</i>
2215730 2219393 <i>My teacher left me</i><br /><i>to my darkest lesson.</i>
2219567 2221728 <i>That in the end, we are alone.</i>
2222637 2228598 <i>And there is nothing but the cold,</i><br /><i>dark wasteland of eternity.</i>
2253501 2256959 <i>David thought the journal</i><br /><i>would satisfy my curiosity.</i>
2257638 2260835 <i>But it only made me want</i><br /><i>to know more.</i>
2261008 2263704 <i>I had to go back</i><br /><i>to the Admiral's Arms.</i>
2263878 2266312 <i>I had no choice.</i>
2302817 2305809 <i>This is a fantastic place. I love it.</i>
2306487 2309251 You sure I can't get you a drink?
2310224 2311521 Soon.
2374188 2375746 Hi.
2376624 2378023 - Hi.<br />- Come here often?
2378459 2380222 All the time.
2384065 2386932 I don't see any marks.
2387101 2389626 You haven't seen the rest of my body.
2390638 2393266 Is that an invitation?
2393441 2395534 Sorry, I'm taken.
2395743 2397540 And...
2398245 2400304 ...where is your host?
2400714 2402079 He's here somewhere.
2405786 2409381 This host, what's his name?
2413427 2414724 Marius.
2415629 2418359 Sorry, don't know the guy.
2418532 2422969 - Of course not. He's an ancient.<br />- There aren't any ancients left.
2423137 2425799 They all turned to dust.
2426140 2429371 So unless you've got him in a bottle<br />somewhere...
2429543 2432637 You're brave to joke.<br />I wish you could meet him.
2432813 2436408 - And why is that?<br />- Because you might learn something.
2439887 2441878 Excuse me.
2456270 2457965 Going somewhere?
2459874 2462843 Now this will only hurt a little bit.
2463244 2467078 In fact, you might even enjoy it.
2467281 2468305 Don't do this.
2488936 2490426 Boo.
2505986 2509353 That was quite a performance.
2509990 2512754 You should be more careful.
2513894 2517193 - Thanks.<br />- For what?
2517531 2519362 You saved me.
2520034 2522025 How presumptuous.
2522937 2526464 So you know Marius?
2528742 2530403 I know a lot of things.
2530611 2533273 Not how to stay alive, apparently.
2533614 2535775 I guess we have that in common.
2536317 2539252 Although I'm a little ahead<br />of the race here.
2539453 2541978 Well, I can fix that.
2542623 2546957 Your song "Redeemer" is about<br />the girl with the violin. Isn't it?
2548662 2549822 Yeah.
2550064 2551463 Is it?
2554435 2556699 What else do you think you know?
2557805 2559067 I...
2559273 2561741 You're shaking.
2561942 2563341 Cold.
2564345 2565903 Still cold?
2567481 2571417 Go on. Tell me more about me.
2571652 2573279 You want...
2573487 2575421 What do I want?
2576824 2580260 - You yearn.<br />- What do I yearn?
2583631 2586395 For what do I yearn?
2586567 2588694 To walk with the living.
2590304 2594764 Out of the cold,<br />dark wasteland of eternity.
2598279 2599337 Well...
2601782 2605115 ...that makes you<br />a very clever librarian.
2605286 2607846 Talamasca.
2608022 2611514 I knew I left that journal somewhere.
2614361 2618229 - Was it a good read?<br />- It touched me.
2618832 2620493 Did it, now?
2621935 2623800 Don't worry, Jesse.
2624238 2626832 Your kind never satisfies my thirst.
2629843 2633210 Lestat, I know something<br />that's not in your journal.
2635783 2636772 What?
2637318 2639752 You still have the violin, don't you?
2640421 2642480 No, I understand.
2643424 2645187 After all, it's only human.
2701882 2703873 Clever librarian.
2714094 2717962 David, listen, I'm going<br />to Los Angeles for the concert.
2718665 2721725 <i>I met him, David. I talked to Lestat.</i>
2722002 2724197 What? Jesse?
2724405 2727966 Listen to me very carefully now.
2729610 2732579 You are no longer seeing<br />things clearly.
2732746 2736512 <i>Lestat told the world that vampires</i><br /><i>live among us. They're mad.</i>
2736683 2741245 <i>They'll be at the concert to kill him.</i><br /><i>You've become obsessed with it.</i>
2741422 2746155 <i>- I'm worried about you.</i><br />- Don't worry about me. I'll be okay.
2746360 2748260 I'll check in and...
2749329 2750956 I'm sorry. I have to go.
2751165 2752757 No, Jesse...
2769583 2773576 <i>The city of Lost Angels already</i><br /><i>fed on the blood of youth.</i>
2773754 2777019 <i>My presence here barely</i><br /><i>stirred a ripple.</i>
2777191 2779591 <i>We had three days till the concert.</i>
2779793 2782318 <i>I could feel something was coming.</i>
2782496 2785659 <i>I just couldn't figure out what.</i>
2818499 2820023 Marius.
2832079 2833842 Lestat.
2835215 2837683 It is good to see you, Lestat.
2838986 2840351 And you.
2840587 2844216 Still wearing the old fashions, I see.
2846026 2848187 Old habits die hard.
2848395 2853526 How did you manage to slip<br />through the '50s in red velvet?
2854234 2855701 I slept.
2857070 2859334 Don't think you missed much.
2860541 2864238 - Elvis.<br />- Elvis, yes.
2866446 2868471 You're bigger than he is now.
2868882 2869906 So...
2870784 2872911 After all this time...
2873453 2875387 ...what's the occasion?
2875556 2881085 You've just become very hard to avoid<br />these days, at least in conversation.
2882095 2885622 - What are you trying to prove, Lestat?<br />- Oh, please.
2885799 2890031 It's a little too late to come over<br />all paternal now, Marius.
2890237 2894003 Two hundred years<br />and not a word from you.
2895242 2898336 You almost cost me everything.
2901281 2902908 Now you've done it again.
2903517 2907078 This isn't the time to settle<br />old scores.
2908722 2911782 Vampires don't settle old scores.
2913894 2916328 We harbor them.
2920634 2922397 How did you find me?
2922970 2924335 I made you.
2924671 2927003 I've always known where you are.
2927808 2929275 Besides...
2929610 2933876 ...I just had to look for the most<br />gauche house on the block.
2935549 2939417 Come. Let me show you what it means<br />to live in the light.
2949319 2950616 Impressive.
2950787 2955190 Reminds me of old mad druids<br />running around chanting in the forest.
2955392 2957485 A return to the primitive.
2958128 2960153 Out there, my fans...
2961464 2963022 ...they worship me.
2963466 2968563 Millions of arms reach out to embrace,<br />beg me to come into their lives.
2968738 2970763 It's what you always wanted.
2970974 2973636 With all my black little heart.
2974978 2978311 Did you think of anyone but yourself?
2978715 2981980 I only have myself.<br />You taught me that.
2982719 2986120 It may be time to get ready<br />for some company.
2986289 2991921 - What's that supposed to mean?<br />- Your music's woken an old friend.
2993930 2995557 Can't you hear it?
2996065 2999626 Or is the applause all you<br />can hear now?
3018755 3020086 Akasha.
3020890 3022482 Arisen.
3023193 3025957 She has taken the king's blood.
3026229 3028129 Absorbed his power.
3028765 3031859 Good. Let her come.
3032202 3034329 Cancel the concert.
3034637 3035968 Never.
3036573 3040532 You're no match for her, Lestat.<br />You're not a god.
3041211 3044009 We were once mortals too.
3045048 3047881 It is our heritage we protect.
3048051 3050849 Such reverence for mortals.
3051054 3053989 Then you should have left me as one.
3114717 3120053 Scent is fading.<br />He was here too long ago.
3120256 3121985 You like him, do you?
3123126 3125151 He reminds me of someone.
3125361 3130025 All he's going to remind you of soon<br />is a pile of bones.
3130300 3133428 We're going to dismember him.<br />Bleed him dry.
3133603 3134797 Really?
3136039 3139475 Is that what you're going to do?
3317820 3321278 <i>Old gods on new streets.</i>
3321791 3325283 <i>Not only had the concert sold out</i><br /><i>among the living...</i>
3325461 3328589 <i>... it seemed all the undead</i><br /><i>were coming too.</i>
3328798 3331699 <i>There would be angry vampires</i><br /><i>out there...</i>
3331868 3336032 <i>... frightened of the light I was</i><br /><i>directing on all our kind.</i>
3336239 3339800 <i>Do you have anything to say</i><br /><i>to the other vampires?</i>
3340009 3343843 <i>Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.</i>
3344747 3348183 <i>Come out, come out, wherever you are.</i>
3348918 3351011 <i>They wanted me dead.</i>
3351220 3352881 <i>Let them try.</i>
3353256 3354723 <i>Bring it on.</i>
3355124 3357922 <i>Better dead than alone.</i>
3373609 3376134 Hey, honey. Want tickets for tomorrow?
3376312 3378143 - Going to the show?<br />- No.
3378314 3382080 - Come on, I got them for $200.<br />- $200?! I don't think so.
3382251 3388156 - What if I say 150?<br />- 150? You're gonna cut me a deal?
3388357 3392555 So, listen, just two girls, okay?<br />So how old are you again?
3395531 3398796 - Check it out. Champagne?<br />- Yeah.
3415985 3421082 Oh, my God, I can't believe<br />it's really you! I'm your biggest fan.
3423125 3424524 Boo.
3425494 3426791 Boo back.
3427697 3430325 Lestat, I came all the way<br />from Tarzana.
3430499 3431625 Really?
3432635 3434227 - And you?<br />- London.
3435504 3438098 A London Goth. I see.
3439208 3443907 It's funny, I would have pegged you<br />for a Talamascan.
3444847 3446781 Maybe in another life.
3446949 3448576 I'm an Episcopalian.
3449051 3452578 And I'm a frigging Buddhist.<br />Lestat...
3452755 3457089 Roger, would you take our little<br />Episcopalian back to church?
3457260 3459820 Just the one tonight? Sure.
3460029 3463294 - Sweetheart, come on.<br />- What?
3463966 3465593 - Come on.<br />- What?!
3465768 3468965 - It's a good thing.<br />- Can I still go backstage?
3470706 3473266 Why are you following me?
3473542 3474941 What do you want?
3488424 3492758 So you come all this way<br />just to return this to me?
3492962 3495931 Out of the goodness of your heart?
3498601 3501263 I want you to show me what it's like.
3501671 3504799 What what is like, exactly?
3504974 3507135 To be like you.
3510179 3512272 I don't have time for this.
3512682 3516914 - All a vampire has is time.<br />- Not this one.
3518854 3520082 Right.
3520356 3523018 The covens are coming for you.
3523192 3527891 How are you going to spend your last<br />night, as you always have, alone?
3528064 3529292 Why not?
3530032 3532398 Why not share it with me?
3536305 3537772 All right.
3540509 3543910 This may be painful for a mortal.
3544113 3547241 You're still attached to your skin.
3548317 3550012 I don't care.
3552621 3554418 Do you trust me?
3558227 3559717 Yes.
3568871 3571237 Then close your eyes.
3648651 3650619 Marius was right.
3650820 3653983 But I never understood<br />until I met you.
3654557 3656582 What do you mean?
3656759 3660160 You're beautiful to me<br />because you're human.
3660329 3662456 Your frailty...
3662731 3664665 ...your short years...
3667103 3668764 ...your heart...
3668971 3671804 ...even as you think it's breaking.
3676178 3677975 All that...
3679415 3684079 ...seems suddenly more precious<br />than anything I have ever known.
3687356 3690189 I'm not as precious as you think.
3699635 3701068 Do it.
3704640 3706130 Please.
3712414 3714644 Let me be with you.
3716952 3719546 Let me know everything.
3727663 3730188 You want to know everything?
3732301 3733893 Come, then.
3734170 3735967 I'll show you.
3758394 3760919 What is it? What are we doing..?
3806709 3808267 Is she all right?
3812615 3815778 Get away! Get off me!
3824493 3826120 Now you see?
3826662 3828095 Are you ready?
3829898 3833163 Now do you want it, huh?
3836238 3837364 No.
3837773 3840469 Of course you don't.
3899768 3902566 They're pretty worked-up.<br />How you feeling?
3902738 3904467 Hey, girls, come on!
3905708 3908871 Okay, through here. Let him through!
3909311 3910710 Back off, fella!
3910913 3912380 Come on, children.
3912581 3914742 Okay, guys. Come on!
3917086 3919054 Let him through.
3924626 3926025 Jesse!
3928630 3929927 Jesse!
3933802 3935269 Hello, David.
3936372 3939705 I must show you my new<br />paintings sometime.
4082851 4084045 Find Jesse.
4132501 4134469 You want more?
4137906 4142275 This one's for those<br />who've come for me.
4322090 4323352 Akasha.
4403004 4405029 Akasha?!
4405674 4408234 Why so surprised, my love?
4409010 4411069 You called, I have come.
4412147 4413205 My love?
4413715 4416275 Never fear me, Lestat.
4417352 4419582 All your wishes have come true.
4419754 4421415 My wishes?
4423625 4427186 For a companion to share eternity.
4429731 4433633 You're bold, like your music.
4435503 4440440 You live your life in the open,<br />like I did long ago...
4441610 4443373 ...when I had a king.
4443879 4445039 Had a king?
4445480 4447175 He's no more.
4447949 4451407 Now you are my consort.
4452387 4454548 That's why I kept you safe.
4455690 4457214 Alive.
4458226 4459716 You?
4461463 4464261 You thought it was all you?
4467402 4470462 The ego of a king as well.
4470672 4472162 Yes.
4473441 4476774 I know you, Lestat.
4477178 4481239 I know that you crave to have<br />the world at your feet.
4482751 4486209 And I have come to give it to you.
4488156 4490124 Where are we?
4490992 4492926 <i>We are home.</i>
4493495 4498728 <i>We live everywhere</i><br /><i>and anywhere we choose.</i>
4499134 4502865 <i>The world is our garden.</i>
4647682 4651812 <i>All these years I'd hoped</i><br /><i>this place was real.</i>
4653988 4659324 <i>For the first time in my life,</i><br /><i>I feel like I'm home.</i>
4659894 4663955 <i>Strange that this journey</i><br /><i>should lead me here.</i>
4664165 4667396 <i>This place that's haunted my dreams.</i>
4672774 4675607 <i>Aunt, you're bleeding.</i>
4675810 4678040 <i>You must be with your own.</i>
4680648 4683173 <i>I'll always be watching over you.</i>
4683384 4686114 <i>I want to stay with you forever.</i>
4687322 4689813 Forever is a very long time.
4693161 4694788 Aunt Maharet.
4704839 4708400 You haven't aged,<br />you haven't changed at all.
4711346 4713678 I was once a mortal too.
4714015 4718145 I bore a child before Akasha took me.<br />I took care of that child...
4718319 4721982 ...and her children,<br />and her children's children.
4722557 4724821 This is our family.
4724993 4727553 My way of coping with eternity.
4729597 4734432 You are what keeps me connected<br />to the world of the living.
4735103 4739233 When your parents died, I brought<br />you here to take care of you.
4744746 4747510 Now is not the time.
4748917 4752683 You were seeking answers<br />and now you've found them.
4753087 4756818 The family is who you are.
4847815 4851979 Drinking my blood allows you<br />to live in the light.
4852186 4857123 And soon the sun will no longer<br />sting your eyes.
4858326 4862820 This is but a taste<br />of what we shall share, my love.
4863965 4865660 My king...
4866501 4869402 ...behold our kingdom.
4870038 4872404 A kingdom of corpses?
4874409 4877810 - Why?<br />- Why not?
4878479 4880276 This is why you have risen?
4880448 4883781 They believed in nothing.
4884185 4885743 Now they are nothing.
4892427 4895487 But you and I,<br />we will change all that.
4896698 4901431 We will give the world something<br />to believe in again.
4902570 4904663 Now come, my love.
4905073 4907132 We have a score to settle.
4919220 4921882 Since my mortal death,<br />I have watched...
4922590 4926890 ...I have guided and cared<br />for my human family...
4927428 4930329 ...generations beyond memory.
4932433 4936096 This is why we must fight Akasha.
4937438 4942239 - For the sake of your great family.<br />- The world we know is about to end.
4942577 4946570 The only way to prevent this<br />is through Akasha's destruction.
4946781 4948271 But how?
4948883 4951511 When she gives blood,<br />she's vulnerable.
4951686 4955554 Whoever takes the last of her blood<br />will not survive it.
4955757 4957418 What about Lestat?
4957625 4963586 Lestat has joined with Akasha.<br />He's lost to us now. Forget him.
4986287 4987845 My children.
4990024 4993118 It warms my blood<br />to see you all gathered...
4993661 4995219 ...plotting against me.
4995430 4997864 - Akasha.<br />- Maharet.
4998666 5003501 - You will address my king first.<br />- Lestat, what has she done to you?
5006140 5008631 Lestat, step aside.
5009143 5010132 Never.
5010311 5012973 The world has changed<br />since you reigned.
5013181 5015342 Then we shall change it back.
5015683 5017810 Humans are animals...
5018486 5020477 ...brute creatures.
5020655 5025888 - Their destruction can only make sense.<br />- We've found other ways to coexist.
5026093 5030462 In silence! In shadows and shame!<br />And for what?
5030631 5032690 For respect of mortals?
5032867 5035028 They are nothing to us.
5035203 5037000 They are merely food.
5037839 5039272 Akasha, please...
5039474 5042500 You think you can change my will?
5043144 5046136 I've had enough of this discussion.
5046314 5047906 Join me or die.
5048316 5050011 I will not.
5050218 5052015 - I will not.<br />- I will not.
5052220 5053744 I will not.
5061929 5063362 Do you love me?
5065266 5067996 - Yes.<br />- Then prove it.
5070137 5071536 Kill her.
5072607 5075701 - She's nothing to me.<br />- Just the same...
5076677 5079077 ...I'd like for you to kill her.
5082950 5087944 - You will not touch her!<br />- You still think to challenge me?!
5091292 5095228 - Now.<br />- No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.
5096097 5098031 It's what I want.
5104405 5106566 How sweet.
5112747 5114339 I'm ready.
5191125 5193218 See, my children?
5194395 5197023 Remember your real family!
5198332 5199959 Or join hers.
5201235 5202759 Now...
5204672 5206537 ...give me my crown.
5208209 5210404 Spoken like a true king.
5213547 5215174 Come.
5225393 5228760 You see how he obeys?
5229230 5230561 You will...
5231565 5234125 ...or you will all die.
5239874 5241705 That is enough, Lestat.
5251619 5253553 That is enough, Lestat! Stop!
5321655 5324180 You kill me...
5324358 5327384 ...you kill yourselves.
5372473 5374270 Wait, Lestat.
5377044 5378534 You must stop.
5533500 5536731 She drank Akasha's last drop.
5538138 5542006 She took Akasha's death into herself.
5543410 5545002 She's not dead.
5545980 5548107 She sleeps.
5606707 5608231 Hello?
5641041 5642770 Oh, my God!
5643610 5645100 Jesse?
5646313 5647746 Hello, David.
5659426 5661519 David, this is Lestat.
5662129 5666156 - Hello.<br />- I have something for you.
5670003 5671766 I believe...
5672072 5674768 ...that you wanted this back.
5676910 5680676 Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
5690991 5692856 - Can I ask..?<br />- What's it like?
5694461 5696759 Do you want to find out?
5697764 5699254 Me?
5699433 5702095 No, I'm too old to live forever.
5702436 5705303 Well, if you ever change your mind...
5708208 5709971 So this is goodbye.
5710944 5712275 Yes.
5771505 5773496 Hello, David.
