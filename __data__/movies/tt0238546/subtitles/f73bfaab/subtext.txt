90381 92716 LESTAT: There comes a time<br />for every vampire...
92926 98138 ...when the idea of eternity becomes<br />momentarily unbearable.
98348 102559 Living and feeding in the shadows<br />with only your own company...
102769 106814 ...rots into a solitary,<br />hollow existence.
107023 109608 Immortality seems like a good idea...
110068 113904 ...until you realize<br />you're going to spend it alone.
114114 118659 So I slept, hoping the sounds<br />of the passing eras would fade out...
118910 121120 ...and a sort of death might happen.
121329 126041 But as I lay there, the world didn't<br />sound like the place I had left...
126501 129795 ...but something different.
130296 132422 Better...
134259 136510 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYS]
163955 169293 It became worthwhile to rise again<br />as new gods were born and worshiped.
169502 172671 Night and day, they were never alone.
172881 176717 I would become one of them.
205121 209333 Whether it was the meal or<br />the 100 years of rest, I'm not sure.
209542 212920 But suddenly<br />I was feeling better than ever.
213213 215339 My senses so high...
215548 220344 ...they led me straight to the<br />instrument of my resurrection...
220553 224431 ...playing in my old house.

265014 267933 I am the vampire Lestat.
268142 270185 It just rolled out of my mouth.
270395 274106 With one sentence,<br />I betrayed everything about my kind.

476559 480228 I may be wrong, but what<br />I remember about vampires is...
480438 483523 ...you generally keep<br />your identity secret.
483733 487152 Yes. But why hide it<br />in this day and age?
487361 490030 I've hidden in the shadows<br />for centuries.

521187 524898 ...that you're giving away<br />vampire secrets. Something in all that?
525149 530529 Maybe I'm trying to resurrect a few<br />old friends. Daring them to come out.
530738 535158 Won't these vampires be pissed off<br />that you're giving away secrets?
535868 539162 I imagine they are, yes.

1002584 1005336 JESSE: Like everyone, I assumed<br />Lestat was a joke.
1005546 1010675 A rock star with a gimmick. Then one<br />of his lyrics caught my attention.
1011010 1014262 "Take a walk down the aisle<br />at the end of the mile.
1014471 1017724 Give your life to my charms<br />in the Admiral's Arms. "
1017933 1019475 That rang a bell.
1019685 1022311 I tracked down old leases in London.
1022521 1026691 It turns out in the late 1600s<br />there was a pub in Mile End...
1026900 1028776 ...called the Admiral's Arms.
1028986 1032155 It had a reputation for dealing<br />with black magic...
1032364 1034949 ...and reports of people vanishing.
1035159 1040455 Here's where you could find<br />the Admiral's Arms in old London.
1040664 1043666 That part of London<br />is mostly warehouses...
1043876 1048004 ...meat-packing plants and<br />a private club in the same location.
1049298 1052800 I think that it's a vampire coven.
1053010 1055762 And Lestat is leading us to it.

1101475 1104852 All the more reason<br />to have told me first.
1106480 1108147 Listen, Jesse...

1164997 1167165 His name is Marius.

1177092 1180720 Marius himself dates back to 400 B.C.
1184099 1186559 So he's older than Lestat.
1186768 1188936 He made Lestat.
1189646 1191022 How do you know that?

2080036 2082079 She's my mother.
2082288 2086458 Akasha, the queen of all<br />who are damned.
2087168 2089086 And he's her king.
2089545 2094716 Akasha and Enkil nearly drank this<br />earth dry when they ruled over Egypt.
2094926 2098887 They drank until Enkil<br />lost his will to drink.
2099097 2104017 Without her mate beside her, she also<br />lost hers. They became living statues.
2104227 2109898 She respects nothing except the taste<br />of blood, human and immortal alike.
2110233 2111775 No. Release me!
2117824 2120242 She made you quite powerful.
2120451 2122702 You'll not stop me!
2123913 2126790 Can I hear her blood in your voice?
2127625 2131128 In all the years of my care,<br />not once have they moved.
2131337 2135048 Until tonight. And she chose me.
2135967 2137551 I chose you.

2258506 2261675 But it only made me want<br />to know more.
2261884 2264552 I had to go back<br />to the Admiral's Arms.

4121200 4125578 Touching you makes me die inside
4125955 4128331 [RUMBLING]
4133379 4135338 You want more?
4138801 4143221 This one's for those who've come for me.
4152982 4155567 LESTAT [SINGING]:<br />You think you're smart
4156902 4160155 You're not<br />It's plain to see
4160322 4163324 That you want me to fall off
4163492 4165910 It's killing me
4167079 4170331 Let's see you got the gall
4170499 4174002 Come take it all
4176130 4179716 The jury is coming
4180134 4184304 Coming to tear me apart
4184471 4186973 Lestat! Lestat!
4225930 4227305 Ooh!
4301380 4302880 Yeah!
4322985 4324235 Akasha.
4325195 4327113 [EXPLOSION]
4327740 4329741 [CROWD SCREAMING]
4403941 4405983 Akasha?!
4406568 4409112 Why so surprised, my love?
4409905 4411948 You called, I have come.
4413033 4414117 My love?
4414618 4417161 Never fear me, Lestat.
4418247 4420456 All your wishes have come true.
4420666 4422291 My wishes?
4424503 4428131 For a companion to share eternity.
4430634 4434512 You're bold, like your music.
4436390 4441352 You live your life in the open,<br />like I did long ago...
4442479 4444272 ...when I had a king.
4444815 4445940 Had a king?
4446358 4448067 He's no more.
4448861 4452321 Now you are my consort.
4453282 4455450 That's why I kept you safe.
4456577 4458161 Alive.
4459121 4460621 You?
4462374 4465168 You thought it was all you?
4466628 4468129 Ah.
4468297 4471340 The ego of a king as well.
4471592 4473092 Yes.
4474344 4477680 I know you, Lestat.
4478098 4482185 I know that you crave to have<br />the world at your feet.
4483645 4487106 And I have come to give it to you.
4489026 4491027 Where are we?
4491862 4493821 AKASHA:<br />We are home.
4494364 4499619 We live everywhere<br />and anywhere we choose.
4500037 4503748 The world is our garden.
4648560 4652688 JESSE: All these years I'd hoped<br />this place was real.
4654858 4660196 For the first time in my life,<br />I feel like I'm home.
4660781 4664825 Strange that this journey<br />should lead me here.
4665035 4668287 This place that's haunted my dreams.
4673669 4676504 YOUNG JESSE:<br />Aunt, you're bleeding.
4676713 4678923 MAHARET:<br />You must be with your own.
4681551 4684053 I'll always be watching over you.
4684304 4687014 YOUNG JESSE:<br />I want to stay with you forever.
4688225 4690726 Forever is a very long time.
4694064 4695731 Aunt Maharet.
4705742 4709328 You haven't aged,<br />you haven't changed at all.
4712249 4714625 I was once a mortal too.
4714918 4719004 I bore a child before Akasha took me.<br />I took care of that child...
4719214 4722925 ...and her children,<br />and her children's children.
4723427 4725678 This is our family.
4725887 4728472 My way of coping with eternity.
4730517 4735354 You are what keeps me connected<br />to the world of the living.
4735981 4740109 When your parents died, I brought<br />you here to take care of you.
4745615 4748409 Now is not the time.
4749786 4753581 You were seeking answers<br />and now you've found them.
4753957 4757710 The family is who you are.
4848718 4852847 Drinking my blood allows you<br />to live in the light.
4853056 4858018 And soon the sun will no longer<br />sting your eyes.
4859229 4863774 This is but a taste<br />of what we shall share, my love.
4864860 4866569 My king...
4867404 4870281 ...behold our kingdom.
4870949 4873325 A kingdom of corpses?
4875328 4878747 - Why?<br />- Why not?
4879416 4881166 This is why you have risen?
4881376 4884712 They believed in nothing.
4885088 4886672 Now they are nothing.
4893305 4896390 But you and I,<br />we will change all that.
4897601 4902313 We will give the world something<br />to believe in again.
4903481 4905566 Now come, my love.
4905942 4908027 We have a score to settle.
4920165 4922791 Since my mortal death,<br />I have watched...
4923501 4927796 ...I have guided and cared<br />for my human family...
4928340 4931216 ...generations beyond memory.
4933303 4936972 This is why we must fight Akasha.
4938308 4943145 - For the sake of your great family.<br />MAHARET: The world we know will end.
4943480 4947483 The only way to prevent this<br />is through Akasha's destruction.
4947692 4949193 But how?
4949778 4952363 MAHARET: When she gives blood,<br />she's vulnerable.
4952572 4956492 MARIUS: Whoever takes the last<br />of her blood will not survive it.
4956701 4958327 What about Lestat?
4958536 4964500 Lestat has joined with Akasha.<br />He's lost to us now. Forget him.
4967379 4969046 [BREATHING]
4987190 4988774 My children.
4990944 4994071 It warms my blood<br />to see you all gathered...
4994531 4996115 ...plotting against me.
4996324 4998742 - Akasha.<br />- Maharet.
4999577 5004415 - You will address my king first.<br />- Lestat, what has she done to you?
5007043 5009586 Lestat, step aside.
5010046 5011088 Never.
5011297 5013882 The world has changed<br />since you reigned.
5014092 5016260 AKASHA:<br />Then we shall change it back.
5016553 5018721 Humans are animals...
5019389 5021390 ...brute creatures.
5021599 5026770 - Their destruction can only make sense.<br />- We've found other ways to coexist.
5026980 5031358 In silence! In shadows and shame!<br />And for what?
5031568 5033569 For respect of mortals?
5033778 5035863 They are nothing to us.
5036072 5037948 They are merely food.
5038783 5040159 Akasha, please...
5040368 5043412 You think you can change my will?
5044080 5047041 I've had enough of this discussion.
5047250 5048792 Join me or die.
5049252 5050878 I will not.
5051087 5052880 - I will not.<br />- I will not.
5053089 5054673 I will not.
5062849 5064308 Do you love me?
5066186 5068896 - Yes.<br />AKASHA: Then prove it.
5071024 5072441 Kill her.
5073526 5076612 - She's nothing to me.<br />- Just the same...
5077614 5079948 ...I'd like for you to kill her.
5083828 5088874 - You will not touch her!<br />- You still think to challenge me?!
5092212 5096173 - Now.<br />JESSE: No, it's all right, Aunt Maharet.
5096966 5098926 It's what I want.
5105308 5107476 How sweet.
5113650 5115234 I'm ready.
5134587 5135879 Ah.
5182260 5185304 [BREATHING]
5192061 5194146 See, my children?
5195315 5197900 Remember your real family!
5199235 5200861 Or join hers.
5202113 5203697 Now...
5205617 5207409 ...give me my crown.
5209120 5211288 Spoken like a true king.
5214459 5216126 Come.
5226262 5229681 You see how he obeys?
5230099 5231433 You will...
5232435 5235062 ...or you will all die.
5240777 5242611 That is enough, Lestat.
5252538 5254456 That is enough, Lestat! Stop!
5322567 5325027 You kill me...
5325236 5328280 ...you kill yourselves.
5373368 5375160 Wait, Lestat.
5377955 5379414 You must stop.
5514383 5517344 [BREATHING]
5534403 5537614 She drank Akasha's last drop.
5539033 5542911 She took Akasha's death into herself.
5544288 5545956 She's not dead.
5546874 5549000 She sleeps.
5580032 5581533 [BREATHING]
5607602 5609311 Hello?
5615818 5617902 [BREATHING]
5641927 5643678 DAVID:<br />Oh, my God!
5644513 5646056 Jesse?
5647183 5648642 Hello, David.
5660321 5662447 David, this is Lestat.
5663032 5667035 - Hello.<br />- I have something for you.
5670915 5672666 I believe...
5672958 5675669 ...that you wanted this back.
5677797 5681591 Yes, thank you. Thank you so much.
5691894 5693728 - Can I ask...?<br />JESSE: What's it like?
5693896 5694938 Yes.
5695356 5697649 Do you want to find out?
5698651 5700151 Me?
5700361 5702987 No, I'm too old to live forever.
5703322 5706241 Well, if you ever change your mind...
5709078 5710870 So this is goodbye.
5711831 5713164 Yes.
5772391 5774392 MARIUS:<br />Hello, David.
