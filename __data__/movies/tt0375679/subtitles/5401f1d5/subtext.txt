169360 171420 It's the sense of touch.
173200 174260 What?
176440 180270 Any real city you walk<br />you know?
180410 184210 You brush past people.<br />People bump into you.
184350 187310 In L.A. nobody touches you.
190080 193320 We're always behind<br />this metal and glass.
194820 197690 I think we miss<br />that touch so much
197830 201760 that we crash into each other<br />just so we can feel something.
203800 205960 You guys okay?
206100 209090 I think he hit his head.
209240 211030 You don't think that's true?
211170 213040 Stay in your car.
213170 215940 Graham I think<br />we got rear-ended.
216080 218100 I think we spun around twice.
218250 223180 And somewhere in there one of us lost<br />our frame of reference.
223320 225680 And I'm gonna<br />go look for it.
227760 230520 - Calm down ma'am.<br />- I am calm!
230660 232560 I need to see your registration<br />and insurance.
232690 234660 Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!
234800 236460 - She do this!<br />- My fault?
236600 238620 Ma'am you really need<br />to wait in your vehicle.
238770 240630 - My fault?<br />- Stop in middle of street!
240770 242400 Mexicans no know how to drive.
242540 247200 - She "blake" too fast.<br />- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.
247340 251010 - I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.<br />- Ma'am.
251150 253910 See I stop when I see a long line of cars<br />stopped in front of me.
254050 256850 Maybe you see over<br />steering wheel you "blake" too!
256990 260480 - Ma'am!<br />- I call immigration. Look what you do my car.
260620 262280 Officer can you please<br />write in your report
262420 264360 how shocked I am to be hit<br />by an Asian driver!
264490 267660 - Ma'am!<br />- Ma'am no. See Detective...
272530 275870 All right. You've got<br />to calm down.
283540 287610 - Hey Detective! Nice entrance.<br />- Fuck you.
290750 295020 - Hey you okay?<br />- I'm freezin'.
295160 297890 Shit. I heard<br />it might snow.
298030 300360 - Get outta here.<br />- That's what I heard.
300500 303230 - You got a smoke?<br />- Nah. I quit.
303360 305960 Yeah me too.
306100 308570 - What do you got?<br />- Dead kid.
318250 320010 Hey Bob.
362320 365050 You get one free box of ammunition.<br />What kind do you want?
378410 380840 Yo Osama! Plan a jihad<br />on your own time.
380980 383540 What do you want?
386750 389480 - Are you making insult at me?<br />- Am I making insult "at" you?
389620 392880 - Is that the closest you can come to English?<br />- Yes I speak English! I am American citizen.
393020 395420 - Oh God here we go.<br />- I have right like you.
395560 397390 - I have right to buy gun.<br />- Not in my store you don't!
397660 399720 - Andy get him outta here now!<br />- Go wait in the car.
399860 400790 Now. Get out!
402160 405530 - You're an ignorant man!<br />- I'm ignorant? You're liberating my country
405670 408690 and I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts<br />and incinerating your friends?
408840 411810 - Get the fuck out!<br />- No you get the fuck out!
411940 413570 No don't touch me!<br />He cheat me!
413710 415570 - Andy now!<br />- Let's go.
415710 417180 Okay.
420850 423720 You can give me the gun<br />or give me back the money.
423850 426120 And I am really hoping<br />for the money.
431630 434190 - What kind of ammunition do you want?<br />- Whatever fits.
434330 436260 We got a lot of kinds.
436400 438730 We got long colts<br />short colts bull heads
438870 441390 flat nose hollowpoints<br />wide cutters
441540 444940 and a dozen more that'll fit<br />any size hole.
445070 448800 Just depends upon how<br />much bang you can handle.
450780 453010 I'll take the ones<br />in the red box.
456220 458850 - You know what those are?<br />- Can I have them?
468200 472660 Did you see any white people waitin' an hour<br />and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?
472800 474700 And how many cups of coffee<br />did we get?
474840 477670 You don't drink coffee!<br />And I didn't want any.
477810 481540 Man that woman poured cup after cup<br />to every single white person around us.
481680 484700 But did she even ask you<br />if you wanted any?
484850 486780 We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want<br />and I didn't order
486910 489110 and that's evidence<br />of racial discrimination?
489250 491220 Did you notice<br />that our waitress was black?
491350 493790 And black women don't think<br />in stereotypes?
493920 495860 You tell me. When was<br />the last time you met one
495990 498320 who didn't think she knew<br />everything about your lazy ass
498460 500650 before you even opened<br />your mouth huh?
500800 503090 That waitress sized us up<br />in two seconds.
503230 506890 We're black and black people don't tip.<br />She wasn't gonna waste her time.
507030 510000 Somebody like that? Nothing you can do<br />to change their mind.
510140 512540 How much did you leave?
512670 514610 You expect me to pay<br />for that kind of service?
514740 519110 What? What the fuck<br />is you laughin' at man?
519250 522180 I'm seriously starting to think that<br />you're jealous of Karen.
522320 526480 Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through<br />a meal without calling her or anyone else.
526620 531120 Okay no more phone calls. As a matter of fact<br />you can hold the battery.
531260 533060 Okay?
534560 536860 Ten bucks says<br />she calls you in the car.
537000 539660 Wait wait wait.<br />See what that woman just did?
539800 541830 - You see that?<br />- She's cold.
541970 545230 She got colder<br />as soon as she saw us.
545410 548470 - Ah come on don't start.<br />- Man look around you man.
548610 552050 You couldn't find a whiter safer or better-lit<br />part of this city right now.
552180 554040 But yet this white woman<br />sees two black guys
554220 556840 who look like UCLA students<br />strolling down the sidewalk
556980 559380 and her reaction<br />is blind fear?
559520 561990 Look at us dog. Are we dressed<br />like gangbangers?
562160 565420 Huh? No.<br />Do we look threatening? No.
565560 569430 Fact. If anybody should be<br />scared around here it's us!
569600 573500 We're the only two black faces surrounded<br />by a sea of over-caffeinated white people
573630 576300 patrolled by<br />the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.
576470 579960 So you tell me.<br />Why aren't we scared?
580140 582270 'Cause we got guns?
582440 584170 You could be right.
587320 589480 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- Gimme the keys!
589650 592310 - Hurry up! Get down!<br />- Okay okay okay okay.
592490 596650 - No no! Please!<br />- Don't look at me! Turn around!
596820 600280 - Come on! Go!<br />- We're fine! Just keep moving!
605530 609940 No no no! Take that voodoo-assed thing<br />off of there right now.
610100 612330 I know you just didn't call<br />Saint Christopher voodoo.
612510 614300 Man's the patron saint<br />of travelers dog.
614480 617270 You had a conversation<br />with God huh? What did God say?
617450 621510 "Go forth my son and leave big slobbery<br />suction rings on every dashboard you find"?
621680 623120 Why the hell do you do that?
623250 626050 Look at the way your crazy ass drive<br />then ask me again.
633860 636330 Chevy pickup and Mercedes<br />driving north on Balboa.
636500 639130 Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes<br />gets pissed pulls a gun.
639300 641930 Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup is a cop<br />coming off shift.
642100 644000 This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
644140 646470 Yeah. Name's Conklin.<br />He's a narc out of Wilshire.
646610 649200 I got the Mercedes.
649380 652940 Mercedes takes a shot at him.<br />Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.
653110 656610 Mercedes rolls to a stop.<br />Driver opens the door falls out dead.
656780 659510 He looks very relaxed<br />for just having shot somebody.
659690 661480 He says he kept tryin'<br />to drive away.
661660 663720 The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him<br />screaming waving a gun.
663890 666360 Shot back in self-defense.
666530 670660 - Anybody actually see who shot first?<br />- They just heard two bangs.
670830 672590 Find me a witness.
686850 689540 That is a nice gun.
689720 694210 The car's registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
694390 696220 And that's not Cindy.
696360 699090 That is a William Lewis.
699260 702200 Found under the front seat.<br />Hollywood Division.
706700 710600 Looks like Detective Conklin<br />shot himself the wrong nigger.
722250 725310 - How much longer are you gonna be?<br />- This is the last one.
725490 727350 Thank you.
736130 738460 You don't think reporters<br />listen to police calls?
738600 740360 I need to talk to you<br />for a second.
742270 744700 You just give me a minute<br />all right?
744870 748330 - Find Flanagan will you? Now.<br />- Yes sir.
749440 750380 Yes honey?
750510 752450 I want the locks changed<br />again in the morning.
752580 753510 You want...
753650 756240 Why don't you just go lie down?<br />Have you checked on James?
756420 759650 Of course. I've checked on him every five<br />minutes since we've been home.
759790 763660 Do not patronize me. I want the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
764390 767020 It's okay. Just go to bed.
767190 770630 You know didn't I just ask you<br />not to treat me like a child?
770800 772990 I'm sorry Miss Jean.
773130 774530 Is okay I go home now?
774670 777430 It's fine. Thank you<br />very much for staying.
777570 779560 - You're welcome no problem. Good night.<br />- Good night.
779740 781170 We'll see you tomorrow.
781310 785370 I would like the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
785550 787810 And you might mention<br />that we'd appreciate it
787950 790080 if next time they didn't send<br />a gang member.
790250 792520 - A gang member? You mean that kid in there?<br />- Yes yes.
792650 796320 Yes. The guy with the shaved head<br />the pants around his ass the prison tattoo.
796460 798860 - Those are not prison tattoos.<br />- Oh really? And he's not gonna sell our key
798990 801520 to one of his gangbanger friends<br />the moment he is out our door?
801700 802560 We've had a tough night.
802700 806330 - It'd be best if you went...<br />- And wait for them to break in?
806470 809870 I just had a gun<br />pointed in my face.
810040 811100 You lower your voice!
811270 813970 And it was my fault<br />because I knew it was gonna happen.
814110 816580 But if a white person sees two black men<br />walking towards her
816740 820200 and she turns and walks in the other direction<br />she's a racist right?
820380 822910 Well I got scared<br />and I didn't say anything.
823080 825310 And ten seconds later<br />I had a gun in my face!
825450 829620 I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna<br />sell our key to one of his homies.
829760 834190 And this time it'd be really fucking great<br />if you acted like you actually gave a shit!
861720 864380 All right what have we got?<br />Talk to me Karen.
864530 866460 Flanagan doesn't think<br />anybody has the story yet.
866590 868930 I'm the goddamn District Attorney<br />of Los Angeles.
869060 872230 If my car gets jacked<br />it's gonna make news.
872370 874130 Fuck!
875370 877600 Why did these guys<br />have to be black?
877740 881140 I mean why?<br />No matter how we spin this
881280 884270 I'm either gonna lose the black vote<br />or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
884450 889580 You're worrying too much. You have<br />a lot of support in the black community.
889720 892210 All right. If we can't duck this thing<br />we're gonna have to neutralize it.
892390 896910 What we need is a picture of me<br />pinning a medal on a black man.
897060 898990 Bruce?
900190 901820 The firefighter.
901960 904860 The one who saved the camp or something.<br />Northridge. What's his name?
905000 906970 He's Iraqi.
907130 910260 He's Iraqi?<br />Well he looks black.
910400 914170 He's dark-skinned sir but he's Iraqi.<br />His name's Saddam Khahum.
914310 917240 Saddam?<br />His-His name's Saddam?
917410 921510 That's real good Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal<br />on an Iraqi named Saddam.
921650 923780 Give yourself a raise!
926820 930260 It's been good<br />doing business with you.
930420 933760 - How soon can I have them?<br />- I'm picking them up right now.
933890 937490 Look you're not listening to me.<br />This is an emergency.
937630 940460 I keep telling you he's in pain.<br />He can't sleep.
940600 944470 Mr. Ryan your father has been to the clinic<br />three times in the last month.
944610 949870 He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.<br />That is by no means an emergency.
950010 953340 If you have any more questions<br />about your HMO plan
953480 957780 make an appointment to come in between<br />10:00 and 4:00 Monday through Friday.
957920 959940 What does my father do<br />about sleeping tonight?
960090 961920 I don't know.<br />I'm not a doctor.
962060 964920 - I wanna talk to your supervisor.<br />- I am my supervisor!
965060 966820 - What is your name?<br />- Shaniqua Johnson.
966960 969620 Shaniqua.<br />Big fucking surprise that is.
985950 988280 Bronson Avenue Westwood.
988420 991080 Vehicle is described as a black<br />late-model Lincoln Navigator.
991220 995710 California plates<br />4 Peter Charles Ida 315.
995860 999260 Suspects are two black males<br />approximately 20 years of age.
1007800 1011830 That's not it. That's not the vehicle John.<br />The plates don't match.
1011970 1016670 The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car<br />and takes it to Studio City.
1020850 1023180 They were doin' something!
1067430 1068790 Enthusiastic.
1070030 1072160 Keep your hands<br />where I can see 'em please.
1072300 1076500 I'm gonna need to see your driver's license<br />and registration.
1076640 1078760 No problem.
1078910 1082770 I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove<br />compartment to get the registration.
1082980 1086740 - Is that okay?<br />- Nice and slow please.
1090920 1093110 How are you tonight Officer?
1093250 1095080 Excellent.
1096990 1099360 Here you go.
1101960 1103990 Stay inside the vehicle please.
1113410 1116170 Let's do it again right now.
1116310 1118300 Step outta the car please sir.
1118450 1122110 Wait a minute Officer.<br />I haven't been drinking or anything.
1122250 1124440 Then we shouldn't have<br />a problem.
1124590 1127210 He doesn't drink.<br />He's a Buddhist for Christ's sake.
1127350 1129150 No it's okay.
1129290 1131780 It's fine.
1134230 1137560 Step onto the sidewalk sir.
1139430 1141660 That's good. Right there.
1143500 1145730 Look at me.
1145870 1147770 I want you to stand<br />on your right foot.
1147910 1152040 Touch your nose with the index finger<br />of your left hand.
1156450 1159010 I told you he doesn't drink.
1159150 1161780 Ma'am I'm only gonna tell you<br />one time to stay in the vehicle.
1161920 1164450 - Ma'am?<br />- Honey honey I'm okay. I got this.
1164590 1166820 Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell<br />do you think you're talking to?
1166960 1171230 Look Officer my wife<br />has had a couple of drinks...
1171370 1174300 Both of you turn around. Put your hands on<br />top of your head and interlock your fingers.
1174430 1176200 Wait. We're only a block<br />away from our house.
1176340 1178630 Hands on your head.<br />Interlock your fingers.
1178770 1181870 - Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.<br />- I'm a television director.
1182010 1184740 Me and my wife were just coming home<br />from an awards show.
1184880 1187110 Take your hands off him.<br />He's done nothing wrong.
1187250 1189370 Put your hands on top<br />of your head ma'am.
1189520 1190980 - Do what he says.<br />- Fuck you!
1191120 1194950 - Put your hands...<br />- And you keep your filthy hands off me!
1195090 1196720 You motherfucking pig!
1196860 1200320 - Just stop talking!<br />- That's quite a mouth you have.
1200460 1202190 Of course you know that.
1202330 1206060 Fuck you! That's what<br />this is all about isn't it?
1206200 1208960 You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a<br />black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.
1209100 1210800 Will you just shut<br />your fucking mouth!
1210940 1213960 I'd listen to your husband ma'am.
1214110 1216370 Put your legs open.
1218180 1222410 Do you have any guns or knives<br />or anything I might get stuck with?
1222550 1224850 I'm wearing a cocktail dress.<br />What do you think?
1224990 1227450 You'd be surprised<br />some of the places I've found weapons.
1227590 1228520 He's clean.
1230060 1233390 What do you think we should do about this<br />Mr. Thayer?
1233530 1238060 My partner and I just witnessed your wife<br />performing fellatio on you
1238200 1240330 while you were operating<br />a motor vehicle.
1240470 1244530 That's reckless endangerment<br />which incidentally is a felony.
1246570 1251140 We could charge your wife with lewd conduct<br />and performing a sexual act in public.
1253480 1256180 You say you're a block<br />from home.
1256320 1258580 We could use our discretion
1258720 1261750 and let you go with a warning
1261890 1265290 or we could cuff you and put you<br />in the back of the car.
1266990 1269860 What do you think<br />we should do sir?
1277370 1280570 Look we're sorry and
1280710 1286200 we would appreciate if you would<br />just let us go with a warning please.
1290850 1293550 The man's apologizing Tommy.
1293690 1296710 I think we can let him go. Don't you?
1299460 1301050 Yeah.
1301190 1303360 All right.
1304530 1307300 You can go.
1315540 1317810 You folks drive safe now huh?
1352110 1354440 Let's go Tommy.
1362620 1364490 It won't close.
1365690 1366780 I can do that.
1366930 1369560 Dad you couldn't even<br />get it open.
1369700 1372560 Have respect for your father.<br />Give me the gun!
1372700 1375330 Here. Now you can shoot<br />anybody you want.
1375470 1378200 Dorri that man<br />could've killed your mother.
1378340 1381800 You think I should let crazy people<br />do what they want to us?
1381940 1383410 Farhad it won't close.
1387180 1390550 Dorri you should be at work.
1402000 1403930 Who are you calling?
1404060 1406660 I'm gonna report their asses.<br />Sons of bitches.
1406800 1410760 You actually believe they're gonna take<br />anything you have to say seriously?
1410900 1415770 Do you have any idea how that felt? To have<br />that pig's hands all over me?
1415910 1418740 And you just stood there!
1418880 1420940 And then you apologized<br />to him?
1421080 1423950 What did you want me to do?<br />Get us both shot?
1424080 1427540 They were gonna shoot us<br />on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.
1427690 1431350 Well maybe you would've been satisfied<br />with just being arrested.
1431490 1435330 Oh I get it. Much better to let him<br />shove his hand up my crotch
1435460 1438230 than get your name<br />in the paper.
1438370 1440530 You finally got me<br />figured out 'cause see
1440670 1443470 that's exactly<br />what I was worried about.
1443600 1446570 Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good<br />friends at the studio
1446710 1450540 were gonna read about you in the morning<br />and realize he's actually black?
1452210 1454200 You need to calm down<br />right now.
1454350 1459150 What I need is a husband who will not just<br />stand there while I am being molested!
1459290 1462220 They were cops for God sakes!<br />They had guns!
1463920 1466620 Maybe I should've let them<br />arrest your ass.
1466760 1470490 Sooner or later you gotta find out<br />what it is really like to be black.
1470630 1473330 Fuck you man.<br />Like you know.
1473470 1477130 The closest you ever came to being black<br />Cameron was watching The Cosby Show.
1477270 1480330 At least I wasn't watching it with<br />the rest of the equestrian team.
1480470 1482600 You're right Cameron.<br />I got a lot to learn
1482740 1485800 'cause I haven't quite learned<br />how to shuck and jive.
1485950 1488780 Let me hear it again.<br />Thank you mister policeman.
1488920 1491610 You sure is mighty kind<br />to us poor black folk.
1491750 1496250 You be sure to let me know next time<br />you wanna finger-fuck my wife.
1497820 1500760 How the fuck do you say<br />something like that to me?
1502000 1504520 You know fuck you!
1505600 1508830 That's good. A little anger.<br />It's a bit late but it's nice to see!
1558690 1559670 How's it goin'?
1559820 1561580 Okay.
1561660 1563750 You didn't get scared<br />or something did you?
1563890 1566650 There's no monsters in the closet right?<br />'Cause I hate monsters.
1566790 1569730 There's no such thing<br />as monsters.
1569860 1573420 - Ah that's a good thing.<br />- I heard a bang.
1573570 1575130 Like a truck bang?
1575270 1577330 Like a gun.
1584610 1588410 That's funny 'cause we moved<br />outta that bad neighborhood.
1588550 1592610 And there's not<br />too many guns around here.
1592750 1595080 How far can bullets go?
1595220 1597160 They go pretty far.
1597290 1600160 But they usually get stuck<br />in something and stop.
1600290 1601820 What if they don't?
1601960 1605690 You thinking about that bullet that came<br />through your window?
1609100 1611090 'Cause we never<br />did find it did we?
1611240 1614730 I think it didn't see me<br />'cause I was under the covers.
1614870 1619830 Hmm. You think it was that same<br />bullet that you heard tonight?
1623080 1625210 You think<br />we should move again?
1625350 1626280 I like it here.
1626420 1630360 Me too. But if that bullet found out<br />where we lived...
1630490 1631460 Oh hold on.
1631590 1633060 What?
1633190 1635250 So stupid!<br />How can I forget this?
1635400 1637630 What?
1639100 1641260 Nah. Forget it.<br />You ain't gonna believe me.
1641400 1643870 Tell me.
1644000 1646400 Okay.
1646540 1649370 When I was five this fairy<br />came into my room one night.
1649510 1652840 - Right.<br />- I told you you weren't gonna believe me.
1652980 1655450 - Okay go to sleep now you little rat.<br />- No tell me.
1657620 1659850 Okay.
1659990 1665220 So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like<br />"Yeah right you're a fairy."
1665360 1667350 Anyway we're talking you know.
1667490 1670550 And she's flying all around the room<br />knocking down all my posters and stuff.
1670700 1673030 She was flying?
1673170 1675760 She had these little stubby wings.<br />She could've glued 'em on you know?
1675900 1678500 Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.
1678640 1680570 So she said "I'll prove it."
1680710 1683270 So she reaches<br />into her backpack.
1683410 1685710 And she pulls out<br />this invisible cloak.
1685850 1690410 She ties it around my neck<br />and she tells me that it's impenetrable.
1690550 1692750 You know what<br />impenetrable means?
1692890 1694720 It means that nothing<br />can go through it.
1694850 1697080 No bullets. Nothing.
1697220 1700990 She told me that if I wore it<br />nothing would hurt me.
1701130 1706060 So I did. And my whole life<br />I never got shot stabbed.
1706200 1709130 Nothing.<br />I mean how weird is that?
1709270 1713170 Only she told me that I was supposed to give it<br />to my daughter on her fifth birthday.
1713310 1715040 And I forgot.
1715180 1716640 Can I touch it?
1716780 1718800 Sure go ahead.
1721210 1724210 - I don't feel it.<br />- Yeah. It's pretty cool huh?
1724350 1728180 I can take it off and tie it around your<br />shoulders. She told me how to do it.
1728320 1731920 - Unless you think it's stupid.<br />- Don't you need it?
1732060 1734820 No not anymore.
1734990 1737860 So what do you think?<br />You want it?
1744170 1745930 Okay let's get outta here.
1751810 1753900 Okay.
1766730 1769250 Put your head up.
1774300 1776890 Okay. Is that too tight?
1777070 1779500 Do you feel anything at all?
1779670 1782000 Good. Then<br />it's just right.
1788350 1790780 Do I take it off<br />when I have a bath?
1790950 1793650 No you leave it on<br />all the time.
1793820 1799120 Until you have a daughter when she turns five<br />then you give it to her.
1799290 1801350 Okay?
1801530 1804730 Okay.
1804900 1808300 Okay.<br />Good night sweetie.
1809570 1811160 Good night.
1851310 1854710 Nah nah. You wanna listen to music<br />of the oppressor you go right ahead man.
1854850 1858810 How in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop<br />music of the oppressor?
1858990 1862180 Listen to it man!<br />"Nigger this nigger that."
1862360 1865760 You think white people go around calling<br />each other honkies all day man?
1865890 1867360 "Hey honky how's business?"
1867530 1869390 "Going great cracker.<br />We're diversifying."
1869530 1874360 How 'bout this huh? Listen. You like that?<br />Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.
1874500 1876230 And you think there's<br />a difference don't you? Huh?
1876400 1880430 Gonna buy me a rope<br />and lynch me a nigger
1880610 1883700 You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop<br />music comes from do you?
1883880 1886350 I'd shoot 'em dead first<br />but I done broke my trigger
1886510 1888710 See back in the '60s we had<br />smart articulate black men.
1888880 1890980 Gonna get out my sheet<br />Put my hood on my head
1891150 1894120 Like Huey Newton Bobby Seale<br />Eldridge Cleaver Fred Hampton.
1894290 1895620 Gonna string 'em up good
1895760 1897480 These brothers were speaking out good<br />and people were listening!
1897660 1899280 Then they'll be dead
1899460 1901390 Then the FBI said<br />"No we can't have that."
1901560 1904220 Home of the brave<br />and the land of the free
1904400 1906460 "Let's give the niggers this music<br />by a bunch of mumbling idiots
1906630 1909360 and sooner or later<br />they'll all copy it and nobody
1909540 1911440 will be able to understand<br />a fucking word they say.
1911570 1912730 End of problem."
1919850 1921940 What the fuck<br />was that dog?
1936460 1938620 - Holy shit!<br />- What?
1938800 1941230 Man we done ran over<br />a Chinaman.
1941370 1943160 You're sayin' there's a Chinaman<br />under this truck?
1943300 1944400 What part don't you understand?
1944570 1947370 There's a Chinaman stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck.
1949840 1953570 - Help me.<br />- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
1953710 1957340 Ah God. What the hell did he do<br />just leap out in front of the truck?
1957520 1960490 Man! This is so<br />completely fucked up.
1960650 1962480 Oh really? No shit!
1962620 1965610 Okay hold up.<br />Hold up hold up hold up.
1965790 1967730 - Get back in the truck.<br />- What?
1967860 1969990 - Yes get back in the truck.<br />- You think we didn't drag him far enough?
1970160 1973030 No we gonna drive away.<br />And he gonna let go.
1973170 1974760 He's not gonna let go Anthony.
1974930 1977960 You know why? Because he's stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck!
1978140 1983340 Now if he could've let go he probably would've<br />considered that option half a block back.
1983480 1986930 What you and I gotta do just grab his arms<br />and pull him from underneath.
1987110 1988640 You grab his arm<br />it's gonna fall off.
1988820 1991580 Then you gonna be standing in the street<br />holding a Chinaman's arm.
1991720 1994410 Then what your ass<br />gonna do huh?
1994550 1998080 If we leave this man here he dies.<br />Then we're up for murder charges.
1998260 2002130 Just grab his arm.<br />We'll just pull him out.
2007000 2010560 I don't wanna cause any problems Lieutenant.<br />I just want a new partner.
2010740 2012730 I understand.<br />Your partner's a racist prick.
2012910 2015310 But you don't wanna stir up<br />any bad feelings with him.
2015440 2017200 He's been on the force<br />for a long time.
2017340 2019470 Seventeen years.
2019610 2021810 And I do have<br />to work here sir.
2021950 2024310 So you don't mind that there's<br />a racist prick on the force.
2024450 2027390 You just don't want him<br />to ride in your car.
2027520 2030280 If you need me to go on record<br />about this sir I will.
2030420 2032220 That'd be great.<br />Write a full report.
2032360 2035090 Because I'm anxious to<br />understand how an obvious bigot
2035230 2038130 could've gone undetected<br />in this department for 17 years.
2038260 2040360 Eleven of which he was under<br />my personal supervision.
2040530 2042900 Which doesn't speak very highly<br />of my managerial skills.
2043040 2046770 But that's not your concern.<br />I can't wait to read it.
2046910 2050770 What if I said I wanted a new partner<br />for personal reasons?
2050910 2054140 So now you're saying he's not a racist prick<br />you just don't like him.
2054280 2057180 - Yes sir.<br />- That's not a good enough reason.
2057320 2060180 Then I guess I should think of a better one<br />and get back to you.
2060320 2063150 So you think I'm asking you<br />to make one up.
2063290 2068020 Uh no sir. I just can't<br />think of one... right now.
2068160 2070190 You wanna know what I heard?
2071700 2073690 I heard it was a case<br />of uncontrollable flatulence.
2073870 2076030 You want me to say<br />he has flatulence?
2076170 2078900 Not him. You. You have<br />uncontrollable flatulence.
2079040 2082670 You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody<br />else so you're requesting a one-man car.
2082810 2085400 I'm not... comfortable with that<br />Lieutenant.
2085550 2088450 I wouldn't be either. Which is why I understand<br />your need for privacy.
2088580 2092310 Just like I'm sure you understand how hard<br />a black man has to work to get to
2092450 2095580 say where I am in a racist fucking<br />organization like the L.A.P.D.
2095720 2098660 And how easily<br />that can be taken away.
2098830 2101920 Now that being said<br />it's your decision.
2102060 2106860 You can put your career and mine on the line<br />in pursuit of a just cause
2107000 2110870 or you can admit to having<br />an embarrassing problem
2111000 2113270 of a personal nature.
2116680 2118610 Fuck.
2148980 2151140 Excuse me.
2151280 2153840 Excuse me. Sir?
2153980 2155880 You finished?
2156020 2159110 I replaced the lock. But you got<br />a real problem with that door.
2159250 2161690 You fix the lock?
2161820 2165990 Nah I replaced the lock.<br />But you gotta fix that door.
2166130 2169490 - Just fix the lock!<br />- Sir listen to me.
2169630 2172690 What you need<br />is a new door.
2172830 2175360 - I need new door?<br />- Yeah.
2175500 2177940 Okay. How much?
2178070 2181900 I don't... Sir you're gonna have to call<br />somebody that sells doors.
2182040 2186140 You try to cheat me right?<br />You have a friend that fix door?
2186280 2188370 Nah I don't have a friend<br />that fix doors bro.
2188510 2190810 Then go and fix<br />the fucking lock you cheater.
2190950 2193680 You... You know what?
2193820 2197310 Why don't you just pay for the lock<br />and I won't charge you for the time.
2197460 2199820 You don't fix the lock!<br />I pay! You think I'm stupid?
2199960 2203020 You fix the fucking lock<br />you cheater!
2203160 2205690 - I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.<br />- Then fix the fucking lock!
2205830 2209160 I replaced the lock!<br />You gotta fix the fucking door!
2209300 2212500 You cheat!<br />You fucking cheater!
2212640 2215330 - Fine. Don't pay.<br />- What?
2215470 2218170 - Have a good night.<br />- What? No. Wait!
2218310 2221250 Wait! You come back here!<br />You fix the lock!
2221380 2225210 Come here! You fix my lock!<br />Fix the fucking lock!
2231420 2235420 I understand. You run over a Chinaman.<br />Stuff him in the back.
2235560 2238390 Then bring the truck here<br />so I can share in the experience.
2238530 2241260 Come on man. It's a little bit of blood.<br />It'll wash right off.
2241400 2243730 - Georgie burn this thing.<br />- Burn it?
2243870 2246060 It's a brand-new Navigator.<br />All you need is a little piece of carpet.
2246210 2248110 You watch the Discovery Channel?
2248240 2251610 - Not a lot.<br />- They got some good shit on that channel.
2251740 2255310 Every night there is a show with somebody<br />shining a blue light
2255450 2259610 and finding tiny specks of blood splattered<br />on carpets and walls and ceiling fans
2259750 2264280 bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic<br />Burger King tray cups.
2264420 2267860 The next thing they show is some<br />stupid redneck in handcuffs
2267990 2272160 who looks absolutely stunned<br />that this is happening to him.
2272300 2275290 Sometimes the redneck is actually<br />watching the Discovery Channel
2275430 2277400 when they break in<br />to arrest him.
2277540 2282740 And he still can't figure out how on earth<br />they could've caught him!
2290750 2294620 Do I look like I wanna be<br />on the Discovery Channel?
2294750 2295980 No.
2296120 2298890 Then get the fuck<br />outta my shop.
2301130 2303250 Oh yeah make sure<br />you get that.
2303400 2306730 Without him things could've gone really<br />fucking wrong tonight.
2309270 2312670 - Fuck!<br />- Don't! Don't you dare.
2312740 2314570 Don't.
2314710 2317770 Graham Waters.
2317910 2322140 No. No he's not here Mom.
2323620 2326590 I'm not gonna go<br />looking for him.
2326720 2329980 Look he'll be home when...<br />Just leave it alone.
2330120 2334750 Mom I can't talk to you right now okay?<br />I'm having sex with a white woman.
2334890 2337290 Okay where were we?
2337430 2339860 I was white and you were<br />about to jerk off in the shower.
2340000 2342830 Oh shit!
2342970 2345060 Come on.
2345200 2350140 I would've said you were Mexican but I don't<br />think it would've pissed her off as much.
2350280 2352510 Why do you keep everybody<br />at a certain distance huh?
2352650 2356340 - What you start to feel something and panic?<br />- Come on Maria.
2356480 2359920 You're just pissed<br />'cause I answered the phone.
2360050 2362320 That's just where<br />I begin to get pissed.
2362460 2365820 I mean really what kind of man<br />speaks to his mother that way?
2365960 2369990 Oh this is about my mother.<br />What do you know about my mother?
2370130 2372960 If I was your father<br />I'd kick your fucking ass.
2374470 2376440 Okay. I was raised badly.
2376570 2379970 Why don't you take your clothes off<br />get back into bed and teach me a lesson?
2380110 2384040 You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.<br />How 'bout a geography lesson?
2384180 2388270 My father's from Puerto Rico.<br />My mother's from El Salvador.
2388410 2391440 Neither one of those is Mexico.
2391580 2393980 Ah. Then I guess<br />the big mystery is
2394120 2397580 who gathered all those remarkably<br />different cultures together
2397720 2400720 and taught them all how to park<br />their cars on their lawns?
2428520 2430850 Pop you okay?
2430990 2433980 If I could piss I'd be okay.
2435560 2438260 I'm... Jesus.
2438400 2440870 I'm done now.
2441000 2442990 Give me a hand.
2445470 2447440 Wait a goddamn minute!
2447570 2450200 - Wait a minute.<br />- Whoa whoa whoa.
2452210 2455650 All right. Okay. Okay.
2463060 2465680 Wait wait wait.<br />Stop stop!
2465830 2468450 - I gotta go back.<br />- Okay.
2480840 2483830 What are you gonna<br />stand there and stare at me?
2552850 2555440 - So Conklin just shot him?<br />- Mm-hmm.
2555580 2558480 - They know each other? It's a grudge thing?<br />- Sir.
2558620 2561210 Not as far as we can tell.
2561350 2563620 You think this is<br />racially motivated?
2563760 2567060 Well a dozen people heard the shots.<br />Nobody saw anything.
2567190 2569130 - Who do we have on it?<br />- Graham Waters.
2569260 2573220 Waters. Tell him he speaks<br />to no one but me.
2573370 2576490 Call a press conference for 4:00<br />and I want Waters here at 3:30.
2576640 2578500 And would someone<br />please find Flanagan.
2580570 2583770 Oh! What up Mo Phat?
2583910 2588240 Man robs purses from old ladies and you<br />"Hey how's it goin' Mo Phat?"
2588380 2591370 That nigger will steal teeth<br />from a cripple man.
2591520 2594010 You callin' him a thief?<br />And we do what?
2594150 2596090 The man steals<br />from black people.
2596220 2598520 Only reason black people<br />steal from their own
2598660 2601250 - is 'cause they terrified of white people.<br />- Man please.
2601390 2605190 Think about it. Sherman Oaks.<br />Burbank. Santa Monica.
2605330 2607860 All scary-ass places<br />for a brother to find himself.
2608000 2610370 Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks<br />in Toluca Lake
2610500 2614600 that nigger will run like a rabbit soon<br />as somebody say "decaf latte."
2614740 2617940 What the fuck did you do to my car?
2625420 2628750 Sorry I take your car Miss Jean.
2628890 2631820 I turn key to my car<br />but nothing.
2631960 2633860 James wanted<br />to take this to school.
2633990 2636660 But I don't want the kids<br />to fight over it.
2636800 2640530 - Are these clean or dirty?<br />- All clean senora!
2640670 2645570 You know Maria just once I would like to<br />wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.
2646940 2649460 Si senora.<br />No problem.
2650540 2651980 I'm startin' to understand now.
2652110 2655880 By your work you're settin'<br />an example for our neighborhood.
2656020 2658480 Sort of like a big brother<br />kind of thing right?
2659720 2660980 Yeah you laugh man.
2661120 2665150 But you have never seen me steal<br />from a black person ever in your life.
2667230 2669690 What the hell do you think<br />you doin' right now man?
2669830 2671130 Wavin' down the bus.
2671260 2673530 Put your hand down dog!<br />Are you outta your mind?
2673670 2676000 You actually expect me<br />to get on a bus?
2676140 2678370 No. I was hopin' we could<br />push your car across town.
2678500 2680400 You know why? 'Cause we just<br />don't do stuff like that no more.
2680540 2683130 You have no idea do you?
2683280 2686730 You have no idea why they put them great<br />big windows on the sides of buses do you?
2686880 2689400 - Why?<br />- One reason only.
2689550 2693810 To humiliate the people of color<br />who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.
2693950 2695280 I didn't know that.
2695420 2698360 You could fill the Staples Center<br />with what you don't know.
2698490 2700420 You know the Kings<br />are playin' tonight.
2700560 2703890 You don't like hockey! The only reason<br />you say you do is to piss me off!
2704030 2706330 I love hockey.
2706470 2708020 Cut! Print. Moving on.
2708170 2712330 Okay that takes us into scene 12.
2712470 2715530 Jamal that's what<br />I'm talking about.
2715670 2718770 Right on.
2718910 2722240 - Cam you got a second?<br />- Yeah Fred I just wanna grab some coffee.
2722380 2725110 Yeah. Listen.<br />I think we need another take buddy.
2725250 2727950 That looked pretty terrific man.
2728090 2732220 This is gonna sound strange but is Jamal<br />seeing a speech coach or something?
2732360 2734260 What do you mean?
2734390 2737830 Have you noticed uh...<br />This is weird for a white guy to say
2737960 2741690 but have you noticed he's talking<br />a lot less black lately?
2743540 2745260 No I haven't noticed that.
2745400 2749140 Really? Like in this scene he was supposed<br />to say "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."
2749270 2751770 And he changed it to<br />"Don't talk to me about that."
2751910 2753210 Wait a minute.
2753350 2758040 You think because of that the audience<br />won't recognize him as being a black man?
2758180 2761180 - Come on!<br />- Is there a problem Cam?
2761320 2762880 Excuse me?
2763020 2765350 Is there a problem Cam?
2770300 2772790 No we don't have<br />a problem.
2772930 2776160 I mean 'cause all I'm saying is<br />it's not his character.
2776300 2778860 Eddie's supposed to be<br />the smart one not Jamal right?
2779000 2782700 You're the expert here.<br />But to me it rings false.
2786080 2789840 - We're gonna do it one more time.<br />- Thanks buddy.
2789980 2793880 Everybody back to one please.<br />Let's do it one more time.
2796460 2798510 Jamal um...
2802060 2804360 Morning Carol.<br />Who do I have?
2804500 2807260 Hold for a minute please.<br />Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled
2807400 2810100 but you have a walk-in<br />Mr. Ryan.
2813410 2816100 Send him in.
2816240 2818510 - Mr. Ryan.<br />- Yeah.
2818640 2820770 My name is Shaniqua Johnson.
2820910 2823440 I believe we spoke last night.
2823580 2826850 Oh yeah. I wanted<br />to apologize about that.
2826990 2830150 I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.<br />My father's in a lot of pain.
2830290 2832780 Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.
2832930 2837060 This doctor he's been seein' says<br />he's got a urinary tract infection.
2837200 2840630 But he's been takin' this medicine for a month<br />and he keeps gettin' worse.
2840770 2842730 And he's been back to see<br />Dr. Robertson?
2842870 2845530 Yeah. Between you and me<br />the man's an idiot.
2845670 2847570 - Really?<br />- No offense.
2847710 2851160 But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.<br />I think his nurses are doing most of the work.
2851310 2856300 Mmm. If you're unhappy your father's<br />welcome to see a doctor outside the network.
2856450 2860820 And if this new doctor<br />says it's not an infection
2860950 2864050 says it's his prostate and it needs to be<br />operated on is that gonna be covered?
2864190 2867780 - Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...<br />- What good is that gonna do?
2867930 2870550 I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
2870700 2874220 All right.<br />You know what I can't do?
2874370 2876930 I can't look at you without<br />thinking about the five or six
2877070 2879440 more qualified white men<br />who didn't get your job.
2879570 2881270 It's time for you to go.
2881410 2884470 I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping<br />that I'm wrong about you.
2884610 2886370 I'm hoping that someone like yourself
2886510 2888540 someone who may have<br />been given a helping hand
2888680 2891440 might have a little compassion<br />for someone in a similar situation.
2891580 2893710 Carol I need security<br />in my office!
2893850 2896910 You don't like me<br />that's fine. I'm a prick.
2897060 2899580 My father doesn't deserve<br />to suffer like this.
2899730 2901660 He was a janitor.<br />He struggled his whole life.
2901790 2903590 Saved enough to start<br />his own company.
2903730 2905660 Twenty-three employees<br />all of them black.
2905800 2908460 Paid 'em equal wages when<br />no one else was doing that.
2908600 2913560 For 30 years he worked side by side with<br />those men sweeping and carrying garbage.
2913710 2915430 Then the city council decides
2915570 2918770 to give minority-owned companies<br />preference in city contracts.
2918910 2921640 And overnight<br />my father loses everything.
2921780 2925150 His business his home<br />his wife. Everything!
2925280 2928950 Not once does he blame<br />your people.
2929090 2932520 I'm not asking you<br />to help me.
2932690 2936960 I'm asking that you do this small thing<br />for a man who lost everything
2937100 2939390 so people like yourself<br />could reap the benefits.
2939560 2941790 And do you know<br />what it's gonna cost you?
2941930 2943830 Nothing.
2944000 2945940 Just a flick of your pen.
2947570 2950470 Your father sounds like<br />a good man.
2950610 2954670 And if he'd come in here today I probably<br />would've approved this request.
2954810 2959250 But he didn't come in. You did.<br />And for his sake it's a real shame.
2959420 2962250 - Get him the hell outta my office.<br />- Prick.
2969430 2974020 Sir I spoke to our employee and he told you<br />you needed to replace or repair the door.
2974200 2975630 He say he fix the lock.
2975800 2978460 - You come here see how "fix-ed" it is!<br />- You're yelling again.
2978640 2980470 I am not yelling!<br />I'm upset!
2980640 2982940 Yes... Yes I am.
2983110 2984670 Mom are you all right?
2984840 2989040 Stop washing.<br />Insurance must take picture.
2989210 2991910 Okay?
2992080 2994380 Look what they wrote.
2994550 2996520 They think we're Arab.
2996690 2998660 When did Persian<br />become Arab?
2998820 3001590 I want his name. Yes.
3001760 3003320 Oh my God.
3003500 3006460 - I want his name! Give me his name!<br />- Dad?
3006630 3008000 I'm not giving you<br />his name sir.
3008130 3011830 - Dad did they take the gun?<br />- Not fix my lock! I want his name!
3012000 3014000 I'm gonna hang up now sir.
3014170 3017840 Don't hang up! Shit!
3018010 3019770 Oh thank God.
3065790 3068690 Mom?
3068830 3070990 Mom it's cold.<br />Come on.
3093290 3095520 Did you find your brother?
3097720 3099780 No Mom.
3109330 3111800 I was doin' good.
3111970 3116570 I was... I was doin' real good.
3118440 3122170 - I know Mom.<br />- I was doin'...
3125720 3127620 It's okay.
3139100 3141190 Did you find your brother?
3143540 3145900 No Mom.
3147270 3149740 Tell him to come home.
3151210 3156510 Tell him I'm not mad okay?<br />Okay baby?
3156650 3159120 Okay Mom.
3159280 3161720 Okay baby.
3161890 3163410 Okay.
3164520 3166490 Okay.
3202190 3205100 - Did you apologize to your mother?<br />- She wasn't there.
3207100 3210660 Internal Affairs called. Found something<br />in the Mercedes.
3213510 3216960 That's lunch. One hour.
3244900 3247000 I tried to call.
3247140 3251580 - Sounded like you're havin' a bad day huh?<br />- Yeah.
3254980 3257640 What?
3257780 3259650 I got scared Cam.
3259780 3265190 It's not like I haven't been pulled over before.<br />You know?
3265360 3267290 But not like that.
3268690 3270630 And yes<br />I was a little drunk.
3270800 3274700 And I was mouthing off.
3274830 3276990 I'm sorry.
3279140 3280870 But when that man was putting<br />his hands on me...
3281010 3282600 I don't wanna talk about it.
3282740 3286140 I can't believe<br />you let him do that baby.
3286280 3291080 Look I know what you did<br />was the right thing. Okay?
3292650 3295310 But I was humiliated!
3295450 3297580 For you.
3297720 3302220 I just couldn't stand to see that man<br />take away your dignity.
3302360 3305300 Yeah. That's what happened.
3305460 3308430 - Oh baby don't do this.<br />- No. No you're right.
3308600 3310330 I ain't doin' it.
3310470 3312940 You gonna walk away<br />from me?
3313100 3316340 - Cameron!<br />- Just go home.
3322680 3326380 Mm-hmm. I understand.
3328220 3330150 Thanks.
3332820 3336190 - Has your father read his policy?<br />- He doesn't read English.
3340070 3342300 Mr. Golzari you said<br />you called the locksmith?
3343870 3345360 Yes. I tell him fix it.
3345500 3349130 They said their man told you
3350310 3352540 to fix the door<br />and you didn't do so.
3354580 3356840 Are you saying it's his fault?
3357920 3362290 Insurance company is calling it negligence.<br />They're not covering this.
3371160 3375220 No. This store is all we have.
3392350 3394380 I really am sorry.
3416940 3419070 What time<br />you must go to work?
3419210 3422080 Not until tonight.
3422210 3423650 Go home and sleep.
3426950 3429550 It's okay. It's okay.<br />Go home and sleep.
3452810 3453900 Hey.

3826500 3829730 Yeah I'm gonna get<br />you out. Okay?
3829870 3833170 Look at me. Look at me.<br />I'm gonna get you out.
3838580 3840840 Oh fuck!
3840980 3843970 - I'm sorry.<br />- That's okay.
3846150 3848920 I'm gonna have to cut your belt okay?
3849060 3851120 I'm gonna have to cut the belt.
3852130 3853720 It's okay it's okay.
3853860 3856520 It's okay. Okay<br />we're gonna get you out.
3856660 3858930 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />Look at me!
3859070 3861530 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />We're gonna get you outta here.
3861670 3863360 Everything's gonna be fine.
3881790 3882550 Ryan!
3917720 3919720 Pull!
3933670 3935660 It's okay.
3945190 3947450 It's okay.
3947590 3951180 All right.<br />It's okay it's okay.
3951320 3953760 It's all right.<br />I got it. I got it.
3953890 3955920 Ma'am? Ma'am<br />can you walk with me?
3956060 3958330 It's cool it's cool.
3959770 3962760 Here we go. All right<br />you're doin' great.
3993800 3997170 The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.<br />He really wanted to be here himself.
3997300 4000000 No he didn't! If he did his own dirty work none<br />of us would have jobs.
4000140 4002370 - Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.<br />- Graham Waters.
4002510 4005310 - Thanks for coming in.<br />- He just pulled into the garage.
4005450 4008540 Great. Press conference is in ten minutes<br />so we'll make this short.
4008680 4012020 Internal Affairs says this Conklin has two<br />suspicious shootings on his record.
4012150 4015380 Both black men. Both times he was cleared<br />but only just.
4015520 4018290 Detective Lewis<br />makes black man number three.
4018430 4021860 You know any reason why we shouldn't<br />hang Conklin for this?
4022000 4027060 Well it's more complicated<br />than we originally thought.
4027200 4033040 We found $300000 in the trunk of the car<br />that Detective Lewis was driving.
4033170 4035270 Shit!
4035410 4039870 Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him<br />to stay in the car until he hears from me.
4040010 4043850 You found the money in the Mercedes.<br />I thought that wasn't his car.
4043980 4047780 The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.<br />We haven't been able to get in touch with her.
4047920 4051380 Apparently she uh<br />left town this morning.
4051530 4055260 So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not<br />have known the money was in it.
4061670 4065300 You really think you're gonna<br />be able to make that fly?
4066570 4069600 Latasha Harlins<br />Rodney King.
4069740 4072680 - These names ring a bell Detective?<br />- Yeah vaguely.
4072810 4078270 We have attorneys for this slain police officer<br />camping in our offices.
4078420 4081110 We have his mother<br />and a half dozen men of the cloth
4081250 4084120 who swear that Lewis was one of<br />the twelve apostles of Christ.
4084260 4085690 We have two black city councilmen
4085830 4089060 and a congresswoman<br />who call on the hour every hour
4089200 4092560 demanding to know what the district attorney<br />intends to do about this.
4092700 4095690 And you want him to walk<br />into that press room
4095840 4098860 and tell them all that<br />the situation is complicated?
4104110 4105540 Give us a minute.
4107250 4109340 No problem.
4116890 4119050 Who knows about the money?
4119190 4121180 You gotta be kiddin' me.
4121360 4125160 There are only two people<br />in this room.
4125300 4128600 Myself my partner<br />Ferguson and Internal Affairs.
4128740 4131200 - Jim Ferguson?<br />- Yeah.
4135840 4138210 Okay. I guess<br />I don't see a problem.
4138380 4140780 As it wasn't Lewis's car the money isn't clear<br />evidence of any wrongdoing.
4140910 4143880 And even if it was we aren't going to<br />prosecute a dead man.
4144020 4148420 Which means the money Internal Affairs<br />is holding can't be considered evidence.
4148590 4150820 You can do this dance<br />if you want to
4150990 4154390 but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report<br />comes back tomorrow
4154530 4157460 it's going to say that Detective Lewis<br />was coked out of his head.
4158970 4160400 Fucking black people huh?
4160530 4162520 What did you just say?
4162700 4164640 I mean
4164770 4167240 I know all the sociological<br />reasons why per capita
4167410 4170400 eight times more black men<br />are incarcerated than white men.
4170580 4174380 Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.<br />Bias in the judicial system.
4174550 4176480 All that stuff.<br />All that stuff!
4176620 4180610 But still it's gotta get to you<br />on a gut level as a black man.
4180790 4183690 They just can't keep their hands<br />out of the cookie jar.
4188430 4190920 Of course you and I know<br />that's not the truth.
4191100 4193160 But that's the way<br />it always plays doesn't it?
4193330 4196730 And assholes like Lewis keep feeding<br />the flames. It's gotta get to you.
4196870 4200270 What did you say<br />you did for the D.A. Again?
4200440 4202310 You coach ball down in Compton.<br />Am I right?
4202440 4204340 Oh please don't do that.
4204480 4207240 Don't act like you know<br />something about me okay?
4207410 4211320 What do you think those kids need... to make<br />them believe to give them hope?
4211480 4214010 You think they need another<br />drug-dealing cop
4214190 4217090 or do you think they need<br />a fallen black hero?
4217220 4221750 Why don't you cut through the bullshit<br />and just tell me what it is you want.
4223830 4226560 The D.A.'s squad loses<br />its lead investigator next month.
4226730 4230570 Rick is quite adamant that his replacement<br />be a person of color.
4230700 4234800 It's a high-profile position and he wants<br />to send the right message to the community.
4234970 4238570 And the right message is<br />"Look at this black boy I just bought?"
4238750 4243580 Well fuck you very much.<br />But thanks for thinking of me.
4243720 4246150 Actually we were thinking of you.
4246290 4249410 Until we saw that.
4249590 4251580 It's your brother's file.
4251760 4254780 Twenty-something years old<br />and already three felonies.
4254960 4257620 Three strikes law. Kid's going away<br />for life for stealing a car.
4257800 4260390 Christ that's a shitty law.
4260570 4262470 There's a warrant in there.
4262600 4266970 But still hey he had<br />every opportunity you had.
4268410 4271710 Fucking black people huh?
4276080 4280490 So all uh... all I need to do<br />to make this disappear
4280650 4282880 is to frame<br />a potentially innocent man?
4283060 4286320 What are you? The fucking defender<br />of all things white?
4286460 4290120 We're talking about a white man<br />who shot three black men.
4290300 4294960 And you're arguing with me that maybe<br />we're not being fair to him?
4295140 4298040 You know what? Maybe you're right.<br />Maybe Lewis did provoke this.
4298170 4300300 And maybe he got exactly<br />what was coming to him.
4300470 4303410 Or maybe stoned or not<br />just being a black man in the Valley
4303580 4305840 was enough to get him killed.
4305980 4309350 There was no one there to see who shot first<br />so there is no way to know.
4309480 4313540 Which means we<br />could get this wrong.
4315490 4318480 Maybe that's what happened<br />with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.
4318660 4323030 Maybe Lewis isn't the only one<br />who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
4323160 4325530 You're the one closest to all this.
4325670 4327630 You need to tell us.
4331500 4333900 What does your gut tell you?
4346690 4349850 So? Graham?
4349990 4352050 What do I tell 'em?
4352230 4356090 You tell me and I'll tell them.
4362770 4366870 Well I think given<br />Detective Conklin's history
4367040 4370010 it's pretty clear<br />what happened last night.
4370180 4372770 Okay.
4389460 4391690 Before I get to why we're here
4391830 4395730 I know that many of you have heard we had<br />our car stolen last night.
4395870 4400200 And as you could imagine my wife and I<br />are both pretty shaken up.
4400340 4402140 But we're okay.
4402280 4406870 And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls<br />and your concern. Thank you.
4407010 4412540 Now just after 9:00 p.m. Last night<br />Detective William Lewis
4412720 4415280 an eight-year veteran of the force and an<br />active member of the black community
4415460 4419550 was gunned down<br />by a fellow officer.

4584060 4586580 Slowly step out<br />of the vehicle.
4586730 4590390 - Get out of my car.<br />- You so brave you get outta the car man.
4593500 4597270 Turn off the engine.<br />Throw the keys out the window.
4609950 4613320 You fucking want me?<br />Here I am you pig fuck!
4613450 4614890 Lie face down on the ground.

4626270 4629030 Do I look like<br />I'm fucking joking with you?
4629170 4630690 That's what you look like<br />a fucking joke to me.
4630840 4633000 - This man is making threatening gestures.<br />- Threatening gestures?
4633140 4635440 You wanna see a threatening gesture?<br />I got a threatening gesture.
4635580 4639240 - I know this man! I know this man!<br />- Get back.
4639380 4641870 - Give me some space. I know this guy.<br />- Get outta the way.
4642010 4643110 Step away.

4647120 4649650 - Man don't walk up on me!<br />- See what's happening here?
4649790 4651950 Do you wanna die here huh?<br />Is that what you want?
4652090 4653990 'Cause these guys<br />really wanna shoot you.
4654130 4656690 And the way you're acting<br />they'll be completely fucking justified.
4656830 4657960 Fuck you!
4658100 4661230 Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.<br />You're the one.
4661370 4663560 'Cause you're the one whose head's<br />gonna be blown off
4663700 4665030 - and onto that man's patio.<br />- Officer Hanson step away.
4666140 4669370 He's a friend of mine okay?<br />He's a fucking friend! This man is not armed!
4669510 4672380 He's not gonna shoot you me<br />or anybody else all right?
4672510 4674570 So give me two goddamn seconds.<br />Can you do that?
4674710 4677950 Lower your firearm.<br />Lower your firearm!
4683120 4686350 You startin' to understand<br />the situation?
4686490 4689190 What do you want from me?
4689330 4693820 Unless you think your wife is better off with<br />a husband who has a bloody stump for a head
4693970 4695830 I want you to sit on that curb<br />put your hands on your head
4695970 4698160 and do nothing until I speak<br />with these officers.
4698300 4701240 I'm not sittin' on no curb I'm not puttin'<br />my hands on my head for nobody.
4701370 4705370 Then stand where you are and keep your<br />hands in sight. Can you do that huh?
4708480 4710570 Yeah I can do that.
4710720 4712950 Good.
4713090 4716850 I told this man to stay where he is<br />and keep his hands in plain sight.
4716990 4721720 This man better be related to you by blood<br />because this is fucking nuts.
4721860 4723920 I need this favor.
4724060 4728060 You can check the guy's name his license.<br />He's got no priors no warrants.
4728200 4730730 I need to let him go<br />with a warning.
4730870 4735770 - What kind of fucking warning?<br />- A harsh warning.
4738380 4740210 Thank you.
4743050 4747080 You've been warned. Do you understand me?<br />Do you understand me!
4747220 4750450 You want something from me?<br />'Cause I'm right here.
4750590 4754620 - I'm trying to help you.<br />- I didn't ask for your help did I?
4756800 4758960 Go home.
4762640 4764930 Yeah that I can do.
4843480 4845350 Look at me.
4846850 4849480 You embarrass me.
4849620 4851680 You embarrass yourself.
4894670 4896130 Daddy's home!
4915790 4917780 - What's up?<br />- Give me my money!
4917920 4920320 - What? What money?<br />- Daddy!
4920460 4923720 - To pay for my store. Give me my money!<br />- Honey stay inside. Elizabeth!
4923860 4925130 Give me my money!
4926830 4929960 - I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!<br />- That's not my truck!
4930100 4932400 - Daddy?<br />- Elizabeth!
4932540 4936770 Hey you know what?<br />Hey I got $50. Here.
4936910 4939170 Fifty dollars?<br />You took everything!
4939310 4943080 - Mommy?<br />- I'm coming I'm coming!
4943220 4947450 - He doesn't have it.<br />- Hasn't got what?
4947590 4952790 I have it. He doesn't<br />have the impenetrable cloak!
4953190 4954820 Lara stay outta the street!
4982190 4985850 - It's okay Daddy.<br />- What... What?
4985990 4987420 I'll protect you.
5014720 5017380 It's okay. Daddy's okay.
5017760 5020730 It's a really good cloak.
5101740 5103440 How's it goin'?
5129270 5134210 I sent her out for groceries<br />and that was two hours ago Carol.
5134340 5136240 Well you are one to talk.
5136380 5140210 You go through like<br />six housekeepers a year?
5140350 5143650 I'm not snapping at you!<br />I am angry.
5144950 5146980 Yes! At them! Yes!
5147120 5151420 At them the police<br />at Rick at Maria
5151560 5155220 at the dry cleaners<br />who destroyed another blouse today
5155360 5159020 at the gardener who keeps<br />over-watering the lawn.
5159160 5160100 I...
5161830 5164330 I just thought that...
5164470 5168030 Carol I just thought that<br />I would wake up today
5168170 5171110 and I would feel better<br />you know?
5171240 5175200 But I was still mad.<br />And I realized...
5175350 5179220 I realized that it had nothing to do<br />with my car being stolen.
5181290 5185020 I wake up like this<br />every morning!
5185160 5189090 I am angry all the time<br />and I don't know why.
5189230 5192530 Carol I don't know why!<br />And I...
5194230 5197330 Yeah yeah call me back.
5197470 5199300 Bye.
5310480 5312280 Really appreciate this.
5312420 5314650 No problem.
5320560 5322360 So how long you been<br />out there tonight? It's cold.
5322530 5324660 Hour maybe.
5324800 5326460 Big surprise huh?
5326600 5329830 Yeah this ain't exactly<br />"pick up a brother" territory.
5330000 5331700 True.
5331870 5333840 So where you headed?
5334010 5336070 Anywhere the other side<br />of the hill.
5336240 5337970 I'm goin' to El Segundo.
5338140 5340410 El Segundo's cool.
5340550 5341710 You've been there?
5341880 5343710 Fuck no.
5350720 5352210 That's some good music.
5355660 5357990 No really. I'm startin'<br />to understand it.
5358660 5361790 Wrote me a country song<br />myself just yesterday.
5361970 5364200 I'll bet you did.
5365670 5367500 Whatever.
5381490 5383790 So what was goin' on<br />in the Valley tonight?
5383960 5385550 Ice-skatin'.
