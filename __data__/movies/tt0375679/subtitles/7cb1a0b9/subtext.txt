180025 182116 It's the sense of touch.
183658 184749 What?
187092 190956 Any real city, you walk,<br />you know?
191059 194889 You brush past people.<br />People bump into you.
194992 197981 In L.A., nobody touches you.
200725 203987 We're always behind<br />this metal and glass.
205458 208357 I think we miss<br />that touch so much
208458 212413 that we crash into each other<br />just so we can feel something.
214425 216618 You guys okay?
216725 219748 I think he hit his head.
219858 221687 You don't think that's true?
221792 223690 Stay in your car.
223792 226587 Graham, I think<br />we got rear-ended.
226692 228749 I think we spun around twice.
228858 233813 And somewhere in there, one of us lost<br />our frame of reference.
233925 236323 And I'm gonna go look for it.
238359 241154 - Calm down, ma'am.<br />- I am calm!
241259 243191 I need to see your registration<br />and insurance.
243292 245281 Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!
245391 247085 - She do this!<br />- My fault?
247192 249249 Ma'am, you really need<br />to wait in your vehicle.
249358 251257 - My fault?<br />- Stop in middle of street!
251358 253018 Mexicans no know how to drive.
253125 257819 - She "blake" too fast.<br />- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.
257925 261618 - I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.<br />- Ma'am.
261725 264520 See, I stop when I see a long line of cars<br />stopped in front of me.
264625 267455 Maybe you see over<br />steering wheel, you "blake" too!
267558 271082 - Ma'am!<br />- I call immigration. Look what you do my car.
271192 272912 Officer, can you please<br />write in your report
272992 274958 how shocked I am to be hit<br />by an Asian driver!
275059 278253 - Ma'am!<br />- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...
283092 286455 All right. You've got<br />to calm down.
294092 298184 - Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.<br />- Fuck you.
301292 305587 - Hey, you okay?<br />- I'm freezin'
305692 308453 Shit. I heard<br />it might snow.
308558 310922 - Get outta here.<br />- That's what I heard.
311025 313786 - You got a smoke?<br />- Nah. I quit.
313892 316517 Yeah, me too.
316625 319114 - What do you got?<br />- Dead kid.
328592 330387 Hey, Bob.
372792 375553 You get one free box of ammunition.<br />What kind do you want?
388858 391323 Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad<br />on your own time.
391425 394017 What do you want?
397192 399953 - Are you making insult at me?<br />- Am I making insult "at" you?
400059 403434 - Is that the closest you can come to English?<br />- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.
403458 405890 - Oh, God, here we go.<br />- I have right like you.
405992 408068 - I have right to buy gun.<br />- Not in my store, you don't!
408092 410183 - Andy, get him outta here now!<br />- Go wait in the car.
410291 411291 Now. Get out!
412592 415990 - You're an ignorant man!<br />- I'm ignorant? You're liberating my country
416092 419149 and I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts<br />and incinerating your friends?
419258 422247 - Get the fuck out!<br />- No, you get the fuck out!
422358 424018 No, don't touch me!<br />He cheat me!
424125 426023 - Andy, now!<br />- Let's go.
426125 427613 Okay.
431258 434157 You can give me the gun<br />or give me back the money.
434258 436554 And I am really hoping<br />for the money.
442025 444616 - What kind of ammunition do you want?<br />- Whatever fits.
444725 446691 We got a lot of kinds.
446792 449155 We got long colts,<br />short colts, bull heads,
449258 451816 flat nose, hollow points,<br />wide cutters,
451925 455357 and a dozen more that'll fit<br />any size hole.
455458 459220 Just depends upon how<br />much bang you can handle.
461158 463420 I'll take the ones<br />in the red box.
466592 469251 - You know what those are?<br />- Can I have them?
478558 483048 Did you see any white people waitin' an hour<br />and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?
483158 485091 And how many cups of coffee<br />did we get?
485191 488056 You don't drink coffee!<br />And I didn't want any.
488158 491921 Man, that woman poured cup after cup<br />to every single white person around us.
492025 495082 But did she even ask you<br />if you wanted any?
495191 497234 We didn't get any coffee that<br />you didn't want and I didn't order,
497258 499486 and that's evidence<br />of racial discrimination?
499592 501581 Did you notice<br />that our waitress was black?
501692 504157 And black women don't think<br />in stereotypes?
504258 506224 You tell me. When was<br />the last time you met one
506325 508689 who didn't think she knew<br />everything about your lazy ass
508792 511020 before you even opened<br />your mouth, huh?
511124 513454 That waitress sized us up<br />in two seconds.
513558 517251 We're black, and black people don't tip.<br />She wasn't gonna waste her time.
517358 520347 Somebody like that? Nothing you can do<br />to change their mind.
520458 522890 How much did you leave?
522992 524958 You expect me to pay<br />for that kind of service?
525059 529457 What? What the fuck<br />is you laughin' at, man?
529558 532524 I'm seriously starting to think that<br />you're jealous of Karen.
532625 536819 Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through<br />a meal without calling her or anyone else.
536925 541448 Okay, no more phone calls. As a<br />matter of fact, you can hold the battery.
541558 543387 Okay?
544858 547187 Ten bucks says<br />she calls you in the car.
547291 549985 Wait, wait, wait.<br />See what that woman just did?
550091 552148 - You see that?<br />- She's cold.
552258 555554 She got colder<br />as soon as she saw us.
555658 558783 - Ah, come on, don't start.<br />- Man, look around you, man.
558892 562346 You couldn't find a whiter, safer or<br />better-lit part of this city right now.
562458 564356 But yet this white woman<br />sees two black guys
564458 567151 who look like UCLA students<br />strolling down the sidewalk,
567258 569690 and her reaction is blind fear?
569792 572280 Look at us, dog. Are we dressed<br />like gangbangers?
572391 575721 Huh? No.<br />Do we look threatening? No.
575825 579723 Fact. If anybody should be<br />scared around here, it's us!
579825 583780 We're the only two black faces surrounded<br />by a sea of over-caffeinated white people
583892 586585 patrolled by<br />the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.
586692 590249 So you tell me.<br />Why aren't we scared?
590358 592551 'Cause we got guns?
592658 594453 You could be right.
597525 599753 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- Gimme the keys!
599858 602585 - Hurry up! Get down!<br />- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
602692 606920 - No, no! Please!<br />- Don't look at me! Turn around!
607024 610548 - Come on! Go!<br />- We're fine! Just keep moving!
615725 620180 No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing<br />off of there right now.
620291 622587 I know you just didn't call<br />Saint Christopher voodoo.
622692 624555 Man's the patron saint<br />of travelers, dog.
624658 627522 You had a conversation<br />with God, huh? What did God say?
627625 631751 "Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery<br />suction rings on every dashboard you find"?
631858 633323 Why the hell do you do that?
633425 636289 Look at the way your crazy ass drive,<br />then ask me again.
644024 646547 Chevy pickup and Mercedes<br />driving north on Balboa.
646658 649419 Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the<br />Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.
649458 652151 Doesn't realize the guy in the<br />pickup is a cop coming off shift.
652258 654190 This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
654291 656655 Yeah. Name's Conklin.<br />He's a narc out of Wilshire.
656758 659417 I got the Mercedes.
659525 663150 Mercedes takes a shot at him.<br />Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.
663258 666816 Mercedes rolls to a stop.<br />Driver opens the door, falls out dead.
666925 669720 He looks very relaxed<br />for just having shot somebody.
669825 671688 He says he kept tryin'<br />to drive away.
671792 674000 The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,<br />screaming, waving a gun.
674024 676547 Shot back in self-defense.
676658 680852 - Anybody actually see who shot first?<br />- They just heard two bangs.
680958 682788 Find me a witness.
696958 699720 That is a nice gun.
699825 704382 The car's registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
704491 706354 And that's not Cindy.
706458 709253 That is a William Lewis.
709358 712324 Found under the front seat.<br />Hollywood Division.
716792 720724 Looks like Detective Conklin<br />shot himself the wrong nigger.
732325 735450 - How much longer are you gonna be?<br />- This is the last one.
735558 737456 Thank you.
746191 748555 You don't think reporters<br />listen to police calls?
748658 750453 I need to talk to you<br />for a second.
752325 754814 You just give me a minute,<br />all right?
754924 758448 - Find Flanagan, will you? Now.<br />- Yes, sir.
759491 760491 Yes, honey?
760558 762524 I want the locks changed<br />again in the morning.
762625 763625 You want...
763692 766351 Why don't you just go lie down?<br />Have you checked on James?
766458 769720 Of course. I've checked on him every five<br />minutes since we've been home.
769825 773723 Do not patronize me. I want the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
774425 777118 It's okay. Just go to bed.
777224 780713 You know, didn't I just ask you<br />not to treat me like a child?
780824 783052 I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
783158 784590 Is okay I go home now?
784692 787487 It's fine. Thank you<br />very much for staying.
787592 789734 - You're welcome, no problem. Good night.<br />- Good night.
789758 791223 We'll see you tomorrow.
791325 795451 I would like the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
795558 797853 And you might mention<br />that we'd appreciate it
797958 800151 if next time they didn't send<br />a gang member.
800258 802554 - A gang member? You mean that kid in there?<br />- Yes, yes.
802658 806351 Yes. The guy with the shaved head, the<br />pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.
806458 808967 - Those are not prison tattoos.<br />- Oh, really? And he's not gonna sell our key
808991 811583 to one of his gangbanger friends<br />the moment he is out our door?
811692 812589 We've had a tough night.
812692 816351 - It'd be best if you went...<br />- And wait for them to break in?
816458 819912 I just had a gun<br />pointed in my face.
820024 821149 You lower your voice!
821258 823985 And it was my fault<br />because I knew it was gonna happen.
824091 826614 But if a white person sees two black men<br />walking towards her,
826725 830248 and she turns and walks in the<br />other direction, she's a racist, right?
830358 832949 Well, I got scared<br />and I didn't say anything.
833058 835320 And ten seconds later<br />I had a gun in my face!
835425 839619 I am telling you. Your amigo in there is<br />gonna sell our key to one of his homies.
839725 844214 And this time it'd be really fucking great<br />if you acted like you actually gave a shit!
871658 874351 All right, what have we got?<br />Talk to me, Karen.
874458 876424 Flanagan doesn't think<br />anybody has the story yet.
876525 878888 I'm the goddamn District Attorney<br />of Los Angeles.
878991 882185 If my car gets jacked,<br />it's gonna make news.
882291 884086 Fuck!
885291 887553 Why did these guys<br />have to be black?
887658 891090 I mean, why?<br />No matter how we spin this,
891191 894271 I'm either gonna lose the black vote<br />or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
894358 899518 You're worrying too much. You have<br />a lot of support in the black community.
899625 902267 All right. If we can't duck this thing,<br />we're gonna have to neutralize it.
902291 906848 What we need is a picture of me<br />pinning a medal on a black man.
906958 908924 Bruce?
910091 911750 The firefighter.
911857 914789 The one who saved the camp or something.<br />Northridge. What's his name?
914891 916914 He's Iraqi.
917024 920184 He's Iraqi?<br />Well, he looks black.
920291 924087 He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.<br />His name's Saddam Khahum.
924191 927180 Saddam?<br />His-His name's Saddam?
927291 931417 That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna<br />pin a medal on an Iraqi named Saddam.
931525 933683 Give yourself a raise!
936691 940180 It's been good<br />doing business with you.
940291 943655 - How soon can I have them?<br />- I'm picking them up right now.
943757 947383 Look, you're not listening to me.<br />This is an emergency.
947491 950355 I keep telling you he's in pain.<br />He can't sleep.
950458 954356 Mr. Ryan, your father has been to<br />the clinic three times in the last month.
954458 959754 He is being treated for a urinary tract<br />infection. That is by no means an emergency.
959857 963221 If you have any more questions<br />about your HMO plan,
963325 967654 make an appointment to come in between<br />10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.
967757 969814 What does my father do<br />about sleeping tonight?
969924 971787 I don't know.<br />I'm not a doctor.
971891 974789 - I wanna talk to your supervisor.<br />- I am my supervisor!
974891 976686 - What is your name?<br />- Shaniqua Johnson.
976791 979485 Shaniqua.<br />Big fucking surprise that is.
995757 998121 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.
998224 1000917 Vehicle is described as a black,<br />late-model Lincoln Navigator.
1001024 1005548 California plates,<br />4 Peter Charles Ida 315.
1005657 1009090 Suspects are two black males,<br />approximately 20 years of age.
1017591 1021648 That's not it. That's not the vehicle,<br />John. The plates don't match.
1021757 1026486 The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody<br />jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.
1030624 1032988 They were doin' something!
1077158 1078555 Enthusiastic.
1079757 1081916 Keep your hands<br />where I can see 'em, please.
1082024 1086252 I'm gonna need to see your driver's license<br />and registration.
1086358 1088516 No problem.
1088624 1092522 I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove<br />compartment to get the registration.
1092691 1096488 - Is that okay?<br />- Nice and slow, please.
1100624 1102852 How are you tonight, Officer?
1102958 1104821 Excellent.
1106691 1109089 Here you go.
1111657 1113714 Stay inside the vehicle, please.
1123091 1125886 Let's do it again right now.
1125991 1128014 Step outta the car, please, sir.
1128124 1131817 Wait a minute, Officer.<br />I haven't been drinking or anything.
1131924 1134152 Then we shouldn't have<br />a problem.
1134258 1136917 He doesn't drink.<br />He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.
1137024 1138853 No, it's okay.
1138958 1141480 It's fine.
1143891 1147255 Step onto the sidewalk, sir.
1149091 1151353 That's good. Right there.
1153158 1155420 Look at me.
1155524 1157456 I want you to stand<br />on your right foot.
1157557 1161717 Touch your nose with the index finger<br />of your left hand.
1166091 1168682 I told you he doesn't drink.
1168791 1171450 Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you<br />one time to stay in the vehicle.
1171557 1174115 - Ma'am?<br />- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.
1174224 1176567 Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell<br />do you think you're talking to?
1176591 1180887 Look, Officer, my wife<br />has had a couple of drinks...
1180991 1184034 Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on<br />top of your head and interlock your fingers.
1184058 1185853 Wait. We're only a block<br />away from our house.
1185958 1188288 Hands on your head.<br />Interlock your fingers.
1188391 1191515 - Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.<br />- I'm a television director.
1191624 1194386 Me and my wife were just coming home<br />from an awards show.
1194490 1196752 Take your hands off him.<br />He's done nothing wrong.
1196857 1199016 Put your hands on top<br />of your head, ma'am.
1199124 1200612 - Do what he says.<br />- Fuck you!
1200724 1204588 - Put your hands...<br />- And you keep your filthy hands off me!
1204691 1206351 You motherfucking pig!
1206457 1209946 - Just stop talking!<br />- That's quite a mouth you have.
1210058 1211819 Of course you know that.
1211924 1215686 Fuck you! That's what<br />this is all about, isn't it?
1215791 1218667 You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a<br />black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.
1218691 1220418 Will you just shut<br />your fucking mouth!
1220524 1223581 I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.
1223691 1225987 Put your legs open.
1227757 1232019 Do you have any guns or knives<br />or anything I might get stuck with?
1232124 1234453 I'm wearing a cocktail dress.<br />What do you think?
1234557 1237046 You'd be surprised<br />some of the places I've found weapons.
1237158 1238158 He's clean.
1239624 1242988 What do you think we should do about this,<br />Mr. Thayer?
1243091 1247648 My partner and I just witnessed your wife<br />performing fellatio on you
1247757 1249916 while you were operating<br />a motor vehicle.
1250024 1254116 That's reckless endangerment,<br />which incidentally is a felony.
1256124 1260715 We could charge your wife with lewd conduct<br />and performing a sexual act in public.
1263024 1265751 You say you're a block<br />from home.
1265857 1268153 We could use our discretion
1268258 1271315 and let you go with a warning,
1271424 1274857 or we could cuff you and put you<br />in the back of the car.
1276524 1279422 What do you think<br />we should do, sir?
1286891 1290119 Look, we're sorry, and
1290224 1295747 we would appreciate if you would<br />just let us go with a warning, please.
1300357 1303085 The man's apologizing, Tommy.
1303191 1306248 I think we can let him go. Don't you?
1308958 1310583 Yeah.
1310691 1312884 All right.
1314024 1316819 You can go.
1325024 1327319 You folks drive safe now, huh?
1361557 1363921 Let's go, Tommy.
1372058 1373956 It won't close.
1375124 1376248 I can do that.
1376357 1379017 Dad, you couldn't even<br />get it open.
1379124 1382022 Have respect for your father.<br />Give me the gun!
1382124 1384783 Here. Now you can shoot<br />anybody you want.
1384891 1387652 Dorri, that man<br />could've killed your mother.
1387757 1391245 You think I should let crazy people<br />do what they want to us?
1391357 1392846 Farhad, it won't close.
1396591 1399989 Dorri, you should be at work.
1411390 1413356 Who are you calling?
1413457 1416083 I'm gonna report their asses.<br />Sons of bitches.
1416190 1420180 You actually believe they're gonna take<br />anything you have to say seriously?
1420290 1425188 Do you have any idea how that felt? To have<br />that pig's hands all over me?
1425290 1428155 And you just stood there!
1428257 1430348 And then you apologized to him?
1430457 1433355 What did you want me to do?<br />Get us both shot?
1433457 1436946 They were gonna shoot us<br />on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.
1437058 1440751 Well, maybe you would've been satisfied<br />with just being arrested.
1440857 1444721 Oh, I get it. Much better to let him<br />shove his hand up my crotch
1444824 1447619 than get your name in the paper.
1447724 1449917 You finally got me<br />figured out, 'cause see,
1450024 1452854 that's exactly<br />what I was worried about.
1452958 1455947 Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good<br />friends at the studio
1456058 1459922 were gonna read about you in the morning<br />and realize he's actually black?
1461557 1463580 You need to calm down right now.
1463691 1468521 What I need is a husband who will not just<br />stand there while I am being molested!
1468624 1471590 They were cops for God sakes!<br />They had guns!
1473257 1475985 Maybe I should've let them<br />arrest your ass.
1476091 1479853 Sooner or later you gotta find out<br />what it is really like to be black.
1479958 1482685 Fuck you, man.<br />Like you know.
1482791 1486484 The closest you ever came to being black,<br />Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.
1486591 1489682 At least I wasn't watching it with<br />the rest of the equestrian team.
1489791 1491950 You're right, Cameron.<br />I got a lot to learn
1492058 1495148 'cause I haven't quite learned<br />how to shuck and jive.
1495257 1498121 Let me hear it again.<br />Thank you, mister policeman.
1498223 1500951 You sure is mighty kind<br />to us poor black folk.
1501058 1505581 You be sure to let me know next time<br />you wanna finger-fuck my wife.
1507123 1510090 How the fuck do you say<br />something like that to me?
1511290 1513848 You know, fuck you!
1514891 1518152 That's good. A little anger.<br />It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!
1567924 1568947 How's it goin'
1569057 1570785 Okay.
1570891 1573016 You didn't get scared<br />or something, did you?
1573123 1575919 There's no monsters in the closet, right?<br />'Cause I hate monsters.
1576024 1578990 There's no such thing<br />as monsters.
1579090 1582682 - Ah, that's a good thing.<br />- I heard a bang.
1582791 1584381 Like a truck bang?
1584490 1586581 Like a gun.
1593824 1597654 That's funny, 'cause we moved<br />outta that bad neighborhood.
1597757 1601849 And there's not<br />too many guns around here.
1601958 1604321 How far can bullets go?
1604424 1606390 They go pretty far.
1606490 1609388 But they usually get stuck<br />in something and stop.
1609490 1611046 What if they don't?
1611157 1614920 You thinking about that bullet that came<br />through your window?
1618290 1620313 'Cause we never<br />did find it, did we?
1620424 1623948 I think it didn't see me<br />'cause I was under the covers.
1624057 1629046 Hmm. You think it was that same<br />bullet that you heard tonight?
1632257 1634416 You think we should move again?
1634524 1635524 I like it here.
1635591 1639546 Me too. But if that bullet found out<br />where we lived...
1639657 1640657 Oh, hold on.
1640757 1642245 What?
1642357 1644448 So stupid!<br />How can I forget this?
1644557 1646819 What?
1648257 1650450 Nah. Forget it.<br />You ain't gonna believe me.
1650557 1653045 Tell me.
1653157 1655589 Okay.
1655691 1658555 When I was five, this fairy<br />came into my room one night.
1658657 1662020 - Right.<br />- I told you, you weren't gonna believe me.
1662123 1664612 - Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.<br />- No, tell me.
1666757 1669018 Okay.
1669123 1674385 So this fairy comes into my room and<br />I'm like, "Yeah, right, you're a fairy."
1674490 1676513 Anyway, we're talking, you know.
1676624 1679715 And she's flying all around the room,<br />knocking down all my posters and stuff.
1679824 1682187 She was flying?
1682290 1684999 She had these little stubby wings.<br />She could've glued 'em on, you know?
1685023 1687649 Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.
1687757 1689723 So she said, "I'll prove it."
1689824 1692415 So she reaches<br />into her backpack.
1692524 1694854 And she pulls out<br />this invisible cloak.
1694957 1699549 She ties it around my neck,<br />and she tells me that it's impenetrable.
1699657 1701885 You know what<br />impenetrable means?
1701990 1703854 It means that nothing<br />can go through it.
1703957 1706219 No bullets. Nothing.
1706324 1710120 She told me that if I wore it,<br />nothing would hurt me.
1710223 1715178 So I did. And my whole life,<br />I never got shot, stabbed.
1715290 1718256 Nothing.<br />I mean, how weird is that?
1718357 1722289 Only she told me that I was supposed to give<br />it to my daughter on her fifth birthday.
1722390 1724151 And I forgot.
1724257 1725746 Can I touch it?
1725857 1727913 Sure, go ahead.
1730290 1733313 - I don't feel it.<br />- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?
1733424 1737288 I can take it off and tie it around your<br />shoulders. She told me how to do it.
1737390 1741015 - Unless you think it's stupid.<br />- Don't you need it?
1741123 1743918 No, not anymore.
1744023 1746955 So what do you think?<br />You want it?
1753190 1755019 Okay, let's get outta here.
1760824 1762982 Okay.
1775724 1778315 Put your head up.
1783290 1785949 Okay. Is that too tight?
1786057 1788546 Do you feel anything at all?
1788657 1791054 Good. Then<br />it's just right.
1797324 1799812 Do I take it off<br />when I have a bath?
1799923 1802685 No, you leave it on<br />all the time.
1802791 1808155 Until you have a daughter when<br />she turns five, then you give it to her.
1808257 1810382 Okay?
1810490 1813752 Okay.
1813856 1817289 Okay.<br />Good night, sweetie.
1818524 1820183 Good night.
1860223 1863656 Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music<br />of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.
1863756 1867779 How in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop<br />music of the oppressor?
1867890 1871152 Listen to it, man!<br />"Nigger this, nigger that."
1871257 1874690 You think white people go around calling<br />each other honkies all day, man?
1874790 1876313 "Hey, honky, how's business?"
1876424 1878322 "Going great, cracker.<br />We're diversifying."
1878424 1883288 How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?<br />Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.
1883390 1885266 And you think there's<br />a difference, don't you? Huh?
1885290 1889382 Gonna buy me a rope<br />and lynch me a nigger.
1889490 1892650 You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop<br />music comes from, do you?
1892756 1895279 I'd shoot 'em dead first<br />but I done broke my trigger.
1895390 1897652 See, back in the '60s we had<br />smart, articulate black men.
1897756 1899915 Gonna get out my sheet<br />Put my hood on my head.
1900023 1903046 Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,<br />Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.
1903157 1904521 Gonna string 'em up good.
1904624 1906500 These brothers were speaking out good,<br />and people were listening!
1906524 1908217 Then they'll be dead.
1908324 1910313 Then the FBI said,<br />"No, we can't have that."
1910424 1913151 Home of the brave<br />and the land of the free.
1913257 1915466 "Let's give the niggers this music<br />by a bunch of mumbling idiots
1915490 1918285 and sooner or later,<br />they'll all copy it, and nobody
1918390 1920390 will be able to understand<br />a fucking word they say.
1920424 1921651 End of problem."
1928690 1930849 What the fuck was that, dog?
1945290 1947518 - Holy shit!<br />- What?
1947624 1950089 Man, we done ran over<br />a Chinaman.
1950190 1952099 You're sayin' there's a Chinaman<br />under this truck?
1952123 1953363 What part don't you understand?
1953390 1956220 There's a Chinaman stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck.
1958656 1962419 - Help me.<br />- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
1962524 1966217 Ah, God. What the hell did he do,<br />just leap out in front of the truck?
1966324 1969347 Man! This is so<br />completely fucked up.
1969457 1971320 Oh, really? No shit!
1971424 1974481 Okay, hold up.<br />Hold up, hold up, hold up.
1974591 1976557 - Get back in the truck.<br />- What?
1976656 1978933 - Yes, get back in the truck.<br />- You think we didn't drag him far enough?
1978957 1981855 No, we gonna drive away.<br />And he gonna let go.
1981957 1983617 He's not gonna let go, Anthony.
1983723 1986814 You know why? Because he's stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck!
1986923 1992151 Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've<br />considered that option half a block back.
1992257 1995780 What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms<br />and pull him from underneath.
1995890 1997481 You grab his arm,<br />it's gonna fall off.
1997591 2000386 Then you gonna be standing in the street<br />holding a Chinaman's arm.
2000490 2003217 Then what your ass<br />gonna do, huh?
2003324 2006915 If we leave this man here, he dies.<br />Then we're up for murder charges.
2007023 2010921 Just grab his arm.<br />We'll just pull him out.
2015756 2019382 I don't wanna cause any problems,<br />Lieutenant. I just want a new partner.
2019490 2021547 I understand.<br />Your partner's a racist prick.
2021656 2024088 But you don't wanna stir up<br />any bad feelings with him.
2024190 2025985 He's been on the force<br />for a long time.
2026090 2028249 Seventeen years.
2028357 2030584 And I do have to work here, sir.
2030690 2033088 So you don't mind that there's<br />a racist prick on the force.
2033190 2036156 You just don't want him<br />to ride in your car.
2036257 2039052 If you need me to go on record<br />about this, sir, I will.
2039157 2040986 That'd be great.<br />Write a full report.
2041090 2043851 Because I'm anxious to<br />understand how an obvious bigot
2043957 2046889 could've gone undetected<br />in this department for 17 years.
2046990 2049149 Eleven of which he was under<br />my personal supervision.
2049257 2051654 Which doesn't speak very highly<br />of my managerial skills.
2051756 2055519 But that's not your concern.<br />I can't wait to read it.
2055623 2059522 What if I said I wanted a new partner<br />for personal reasons?
2059623 2062885 So now you're saying he's not a<br />racist prick, you just don't like him.
2062990 2065922 - Yes, sir.<br />- That's not a good enough reason.
2066023 2068921 Then I guess I should think of a better one<br />and get back to you.
2069023 2071887 So you think I'm asking you<br />to make one up.
2071990 2076752 Uh, no, sir. I just can't<br />think of one... right now.
2076856 2078947 You wanna know what I heard?
2080390 2082447 I heard it was a case<br />of uncontrollable flatulence.
2082556 2084749 You want me to say<br />he has flatulence?
2084856 2087617 Not him. You. You have<br />uncontrollable flatulence.
2087723 2091383 You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody<br />else so you're requesting a one-man car.
2091490 2094115 I'm not... comfortable with that,<br />Lieutenant.
2094223 2097155 I wouldn't be either. Which is why<br />I understand your need for privacy.
2097257 2101019 Just like I'm sure you understand how hard<br />a black man has to work to get to,
2101123 2104283 say, where I am, in a racist fucking<br />organization like the L.A.P.D.
2104390 2107379 And how easily<br />that can be taken away.
2107490 2110614 Now, that being said,<br />it's your decision.
2110723 2115553 You can put your career and mine<br />on the line in pursuit of a just cause,
2115656 2119554 or you can admit to having<br />an embarrassing problem
2119656 2121952 of a personal nature.
2125324 2127290 Fuck.
2157590 2159783 Excuse me.
2159890 2162481 Excuse me. Sir?
2162590 2164522 You finished?
2164623 2167748 I replaced the lock. But you got<br />a real problem with that door.
2167856 2170322 You fix the lock?
2170424 2174617 Nah, I replaced the lock.<br />But you gotta fix that door.
2174723 2178121 - Just fix the lock!<br />- Sir, listen to me.
2178223 2181314 What you need is a new door.
2181423 2183981 - I need new door?<br />- Yeah.
2184090 2186555 Okay. How much?
2186656 2190520 I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call<br />somebody that sells doors.
2190623 2194749 You try to cheat me, right?<br />You have a friend that fix door?
2194856 2196981 Nah, I don't have a friend<br />that fix doors, bro.
2197090 2199419 Then go and fix<br />the fucking lock, you cheater.
2199523 2202285 You... You know what?
2202390 2205913 Why don't you just pay for the lock<br />and I won't charge you for the time.
2206023 2208420 You don't fix the lock!<br />I pay! You think I'm stupid?
2208523 2211614 You fix the fucking lock,<br />you cheater!
2211723 2214365 - I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.<br />- Then fix the fucking lock!
2214389 2217753 I replaced the lock!<br />You gotta fix the fucking door!
2217856 2221084 You cheat!<br />You fucking cheater!
2221190 2223917 - Fine. Don't pay.<br />- What?
2224023 2226750 - Have a good night.<br />- What? No. Wait!
2226856 2229822 Wait! You come back here!<br />You fix the lock!
2229923 2233787 Come here! You fix my lock!<br />Fix the fucking lock!
2239957 2243980 I understand. You run over a Chinaman.<br />Stuff him in the back.
2244090 2246954 Then bring the truck here<br />so I can share in the experience.
2247057 2249818 Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.<br />It'll wash right off.
2249923 2252287 - Georgie, burn this thing.<br />- Burn it?
2252389 2254699 It's a brand-new Navigator.<br />All you need is a little piece of carpet.
2254723 2256655 You watch the Discovery Channel?
2256756 2260154 - Not a lot.<br />- They got some good shit on that channel.
2260257 2263848 Every night there is a show with somebody<br />shining a blue light
2263957 2268151 and finding tiny specks of blood splattered<br />on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,
2268257 2272814 bathroom fixtures and special-edition<br />plastic Burger King tray cups.
2272923 2276377 The next thing they show is some<br />stupid redneck in handcuffs
2276489 2280683 who looks absolutely stunned<br />that this is happening to him.
2280790 2283813 Sometimes the redneck is actually<br />watching the Discovery Channel
2283923 2285912 when they break in<br />to arrest him.
2286023 2291251 And he still can't figure out how on earth<br />they could've caught him!
2299223 2303121 Do I look like I wanna be<br />on the Discovery Channel?
2303223 2304483 No.
2304590 2307385 Then get the fuck outta my shop.
2309590 2311749 Oh, yeah, make sure<br />you get that.
2311856 2315220 Without him, things could've gone really<br />fucking wrong tonight.
2317489 2321081 - Fuck!<br />- Don't! Don't you dare.
2321190 2323053 Don't.
2323157 2326248 Graham Waters.
2326356 2330618 No. No, he's not here, Mom.
2332057 2335046 I'm not gonna go<br />looking for him.
2335157 2338452 Look, he'll be home when...<br />Just leave it alone.
2338556 2343216 Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?<br />I'm having sex with a white woman.
2343323 2345755 Okay, where were we?
2345856 2348321 I was white, and you were<br />about to jerk off in the shower.
2348752 2351616 Oh, shit!
2351718 2353843 Come on.
2353952 2358907 I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't<br />think it would've pissed her off as much.
2359019 2361280 Why do you keep everybody<br />at a certain distance, huh?
2361385 2365113 - What, you start to feel something and panic?<br />- Come on, Maria.
2365219 2368673 You're just pissed<br />'cause I answered the phone.
2368785 2371081 That's just where<br />I begin to get pissed.
2371185 2374582 I mean, really, what kind of man<br />speaks to his mother that way?
2374685 2378742 Oh, this is about my mother.<br />What do you know about my mother?
2378852 2381716 If I was your father,<br />I'd kick your fucking ass.
2383185 2385174 Okay. I was raised badly.
2385285 2388718 Why don't you take your clothes off,<br />get back into bed and teach me a lesson?
2388818 2392773 You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.<br />How 'bout a geography lesson?
2392885 2397011 My father's from Puerto Rico.<br />My mother's from El Salvador.
2397119 2400176 Neither one of those is Mexico.
2400285 2402717 Ah. Then I guess<br />the big mystery is
2402818 2406306 who gathered all those remarkably<br />different cultures together
2406418 2409441 and taught them all how to park<br />their cars on their lawns?
2437184 2439548 Pop, you okay?
2439652 2442675 If I could piss, I'd be okay.
2444218 2446946 I'm... Jesus.
2447052 2449540 I'm done now.
2449652 2451675 Give me a hand.
2454119 2456108 Wait a goddamn minute!
2456218 2458878 - Wait a minute.<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2460852 2464306 All right. Okay. Okay.
2471685 2474344 Wait, wait, wait.<br />Stop, stop!
2474451 2477111 - I gotta go back.<br />- Okay.
2489451 2492474 What, are you gonna<br />stand there and stare at me?
2561385 2564011 - So Conklin just shot him?<br />- Mm-hmm.
2564118 2567050 - They know each other? It's a grudge thing?<br />- Sir.
2567151 2569777 Not as far as we can tell.
2569885 2572180 You think this is<br />racially motivated?
2572285 2575615 Well, a dozen people heard the shots.<br />Nobody saw anything.
2575718 2577684 - Who do we have on it?<br />- Graham Waters.
2577785 2581774 Waters. Tell him he speaks<br />to no one but me.
2581885 2585044 Call a press conference for 4:00,<br />and I want Waters here at 3:30.
2585151 2587049 And would someone<br />please find Flanagan.
2589084 2592312 Oh! What up, Mo Phat?
2592418 2596783 Man robs purses from old ladies and you,<br />"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"
2596885 2599908 That nigger will steal teeth<br />from a cripple, man.
2600018 2602541 You callin' him a thief?<br />And we do what?
2602652 2604618 The man steals<br />from black people.
2604718 2607047 Only reason black people<br />steal from their own
2607151 2609777 - is 'cause they terrified of white people.<br />- Man, please.
2609885 2613715 Think about it. Sherman Oaks.<br />Burbank. Santa Monica.
2613818 2616375 All scary-ass places<br />for a brother to find himself.
2616485 2618883 Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks<br />in Toluca Lake,
2618984 2623110 that nigger will run like a rabbit soon<br />as somebody say "decaf latte."
2623218 2626446 What the fuck did you do to my car?
2633885 2637248 Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.
2637351 2640317 I turn key to my car,<br />but nothing.
2640418 2642350 James wanted<br />to take this to school.
2642451 2645144 But I don't want the kids<br />to fight over it.
2645251 2649013 - Are these clean or dirty?<br />- All clean, senora!
2649118 2654050 You know, Maria, just once I would like to<br />wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.
2655385 2657943 Si, senora.<br />No problem.
2658984 2660450 I'm startin' to understand now.
2660551 2664347 By your work, you're settin'<br />an example for our neighborhood.
2664451 2666939 Sort of like a big brother<br />kind of thing, right?
2668151 2669447 Yeah, you laugh, man.
2669551 2673608 But you have never seen me steal<br />from a black person ever in your life.
2675652 2678140 What the hell do you think<br />you doin' right now, man?
2678251 2679581 Wavin' down the bus.
2679685 2681980 Put your hand down, dog!<br />Are you outta your mind?
2682084 2684448 You actually expect me<br />to get on a bus?
2684551 2686813 No. I was hopin' we could<br />push your car across town.
2686918 2688927 You know why? 'Cause we just<br />don't do stuff like that no more.
2688951 2691577 You have no idea, do you?
2691685 2695173 You have no idea why they put them great<br />big windows on the sides of buses, do you?
2695285 2697843 - Why?<br />- One reason only.
2697951 2702247 To humiliate the people of color<br />who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.
2702351 2703715 I didn't know that.
2703818 2706784 You could fill the Staples Center<br />with what you don't know.
2706885 2708851 You know the Kings<br />are playin' tonight.
2708951 2712315 You don't like hockey! The only reason<br />you say you do is to piss me off!
2712418 2714748 I love hockey.
2714852 2716442 Cut! Print. Moving on.
2716551 2720745 Okay, that takes us into scene 12.
2720852 2723942 Jamal, that's what<br />I'm talking about.
2724051 2727176 Right on.
2727285 2730649 - Cam, you got a second?<br />- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.
2730752 2733513 Yeah. Listen.<br />I think we need another take, buddy.
2733618 2736345 That looked pretty terrific, man.
2736451 2740611 This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal<br />seeing a speech coach or something?
2740718 2742650 What do you mean?
2742752 2746206 Have you noticed, uh...<br />This is weird for a white guy to say,
2746318 2750080 but have you noticed he's talking<br />a lot less black lately?
2751884 2753646 No, I haven't noticed that.
2753752 2757514 Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed<br />to say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."
2757618 2760140 And he changed it to,<br />"Don't talk to me about that."
2760251 2761581 Wait a minute.
2761685 2766413 You think because of that, the audience<br />won't recognize him as being a black man?
2766518 2769541 - Come on!<br />- Is there a problem, Cam?
2769652 2771242 Excuse me?
2771351 2773715 Is there a problem, Cam?
2778618 2781140 No, we don't have a problem.
2781251 2784513 I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,<br />it's not his character.
2784618 2787209 Eddie's supposed to be<br />the smart one, not Jamal, right?
2787318 2791045 You're the expert here.<br />But to me, it rings false.
2794385 2798181 - We're gonna do it one more time.<br />- Thanks, buddy.
2798285 2802217 Everybody back to one, please.<br />Let's do it one more time.
2804752 2806842 Jamal, um...
2810351 2812681 Morning, Carol.<br />Who do I have?
2812785 2815580 Hold for a minute, please.<br />Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,
2815685 2818412 but you have a walk-in,<br />Mr. Ryan.
2821685 2824412 Send him in.
2824518 2826813 - Mr. Ryan.<br />- Yeah.
2826918 2829077 My name is Shaniqua Johnson.
2829184 2831742 I believe we spoke last night.
2831851 2835147 Oh, yeah. I wanted<br />to apologize about that.
2835251 2838445 I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.<br />My father's in a lot of pain.
2838551 2841073 Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.
2841184 2845344 This doctor he's been seein' says<br />he's got a urinary tract infection.
2845451 2848905 But he's been takin' this medicine for<br />a month, and he keeps gettin' worse.
2849018 2851007 And he's been back to see<br />Dr. Robertson?
2851118 2853811 Yeah. Between you and me,<br />the man's an idiot.
2853918 2855850 - Really?<br />- No offense.
2855951 2859440 But the guy sees 100 patients an hour. I<br />think his nurses are doing most of the work.
2859551 2864574 Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's<br />welcome to see a doctor outside the network.
2864685 2869083 And if this new doctor<br />says it's not an infection,
2869184 2872344 says it's his prostate and it needs to be<br />operated on, is that gonna be covered?
2872418 2876043 - Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...<br />- What good is that gonna do?
2876151 2878810 I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
2878918 2882476 All right.<br />You know what I can't do?
2882585 2885176 I can't look at you without<br />thinking about the five or six
2885285 2887683 more qualified white men<br />who didn't get your job.
2887784 2889512 It's time for you to go.
2889618 2892708 I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping<br />that I'm wrong about you.
2892817 2894613 I'm hoping that someone like yourself,
2894717 2896774 someone who may have<br />been given a helping hand,
2896884 2899680 might have a little compassion<br />for someone in a similar situation.
2899784 2901943 Carol, I need security<br />in my office!
2902051 2905142 You don't like me,<br />that's fine. I'm a prick.
2905251 2907808 My father doesn't deserve<br />to suffer like this.
2907918 2909884 He was a janitor.<br />He struggled his whole life.
2909984 2911813 Saved enough to start<br />his own company.
2911918 2913884 Twenty-three employees,<br />all of them black.
2913984 2916678 Paid 'em equal wages when<br />no one else was doing that.
2916784 2921773 For 30 years he worked side by side with<br />those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.
2921884 2923646 Then the city council decides
2923751 2926979 to give minority-owned companies<br />preference in city contracts.
2927084 2929845 And overnight,<br />my father loses everything.
2929951 2933349 His business, his home,<br />his wife. Everything!
2933451 2937144 Not once does he blame<br />your people.
2937251 2940705 I'm not asking you to help me.
2940817 2945147 I'm asking that you do this small thing<br />for a man who lost everything
2945251 2947581 so people like yourself<br />could reap the benefits.
2947684 2949980 And do you know<br />what it's gonna cost you?
2950084 2952016 Nothing.
2952118 2954107 Just a flick of your pen.
2955684 2958617 Your father sounds like<br />a good man.
2958717 2962843 And if he'd come in here today, I probably<br />would've approved this request.
2962951 2967407 But he didn't come in. You did.<br />And for his sake, it's a real shame.
2967518 2970416 - Get him the hell outta my office.<br />- Prick.
2977518 2982177 Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told<br />you you needed to replace or repair the door.
2982285 2983773 He say he fix the lock.
2983884 2986612 - You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!<br />- You're yelling again.
2986717 2988615 I am not yelling!<br />I'm upset!
2988717 2991081 Yes... Yes, I am.
2991184 2992809 Mom, are you all right?
2992918 2997180 Stop washing.<br />Insurance must take picture.
2997285 3000046 Okay?
3000151 3002515 Look what they wrote.
3002617 3004640 They think we're Arab.
3004751 3006774 When did Persian become Arab?
3006884 3009714 I want his name. Yes.
3009817 3011443 Oh, my God.
3011551 3014574 - I want his name! Give me his name!<br />- Dad?
3014684 3016082 I'm not giving you<br />his name, sir.
3016184 3019946 - Dad, did they take the gun?<br />- Not fix my lock! I want his name!
3020051 3022108 I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
3022218 3025945 Don't hang up! Shit!
3026051 3027880 Oh, thank God.
3073784 3076716 Mom?
3076817 3079045 Mom, it's cold.<br />Come on.
3101251 3103546 Did you find your brother?
3105684 3107809 No, Mom.
3117285 3119807 I was doin' good.
3119918 3124577 I was... I was doin' real good.
3126385 3130147 - I know, Mom.<br />- I was doin'...
3133651 3135583 It's okay.
3147018 3149177 Did you find your brother?
3151450 3153848 No, Mom.
3155184 3157706 Tell him to come home.
3159118 3164448 Tell him I'm not mad, okay?<br />Okay, baby?
3164550 3167073 Okay, Mom.
3167184 3169672 Okay, baby.
3169784 3171375 Okay.
3172418 3174440 Okay.
3210051 3212983 - Did you apologize to your mother?<br />- She wasn't there.
3214951 3218576 Internal Affairs called. Found something<br />in the Mercedes.
3221351 3224874 That's lunch. One hour.
3252717 3254842 I tried to call.
3254951 3259440 - Sounded like you're havin' a bad day, huh?<br />- Yeah.
3262784 3265477 What?
3265584 3267482 I got scared, Cam.
3267584 3273040 It's not like I haven't been<br />pulled over before. You know?
3273151 3275140 But not like that.
3276484 3278473 And, yes, I was a little drunk.
3278584 3282516 And I was mouthing off.
3282617 3284810 I'm sorry.
3286918 3288760 But when that man was putting<br />his hands on me...
3288784 3290409 I don't wanna talk about it.
3290517 3293950 I can't believe<br />you let him do that, baby.
3294051 3298881 Look, I know what you did<br />was the right thing. Okay?
3300417 3303111 But I was humiliated!
3303218 3305376 For you.
3305484 3310008 I just couldn't stand to see that man<br />take away your dignity.
3310118 3313107 Yeah. That's what happened.
3313218 3316241 - Oh, baby, don't do this.<br />- No. No, you're right.
3316350 3318112 I ain't doin' it.
3318218 3320740 You gonna walk away from me?
3320851 3324113 - Cameron!<br />- Just go home.
3330151 3333878 Mm-hmm. I understand.
3335951 3337917 Thanks.
3340550 3343948 - Has your father read his policy?<br />- He doesn't read English.
3347784 3350046 Mr. Golzari, you said<br />you called the locksmith?
3351584 3353107 Yes. I tell him, fix it.
3353218 3356877 They said their man told you
3358018 3360279 to fix the door,<br />and you didn't do so.
3362284 3364580 Are you saying it's his fault?
3365617 3370016 Insurance company is calling it negligence.<br />They're not covering this.
3378851 3382943 No. This store is all we have.
3400018 3402075 I really am sorry.
3424584 3426743 What time you must go to work?
3426851 3429749 Not until tonight.
3429851 3431316 Go home and sleep.
3434584 3437209 It's okay. It's okay.<br />Go home and sleep.
3460417 3461542 Hey.
3463284 3466682 Maybe they didn't tell you,<br />but I've been reassigned.
3466784 3468977 Yeah, they told me.
3469084 3471879 I just wanted to say, good luck
3471984 3473813 and it was good ridin' with you.
3473918 3475577 You too.
3478584 3481846 Wait till you've been on the job<br />a few more years.
3481951 3485144 - Yeah.<br />- Look at me, look at me.
3485250 3489876 Wait till you've been doin' it<br />a little longer.
3489984 3493916 You think you know<br />who you are, hmm?
3494018 3496848 You have no idea.
3500317 3503408 Yo, Gomez,<br />you ready to roll, homie?
3503517 3505346 Ready, amigo.
3515084 3518106 Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.
3518217 3522877 21-L-23, picking up strange noises<br />from your car.
3522984 3526780 21-L, is your mike open<br />by any chance?
3657925 3659788 Call it in.
3697257 3699052 Ma'am?
3699157 3701180 Can you hear me?
3701291 3703723 Paramedics are rolling.<br />They'll be here in two minutes.
3703825 3706882 - Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.<br />- Jesus.
3710558 3713955 Ma'am, are you hurt?
3714057 3717114 - Can you move?<br />- I... I can't breathe.
3720191 3723214 Okay, I'm gonna get you out.
3729990 3731456 It's okay.
3735724 3738212 Okay. Okay.
3738324 3740222 Okay, I'm gonna get you out.
3744558 3746524 No!
3746624 3749681 - It's okay.<br />- Get away from me!
3749791 3752847 Get away.<br />Stay away from me!
3752957 3756219 Not you! Not you!
3756324 3759119 - It's okay.<br />- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
3759224 3762816 - Keep away from me!<br />- Lady, I'm tryin'- - I'm tryin' to help you.
3762924 3765447 Fuck you!<br />Not you!
3765558 3768524 Somebody!<br />Anybody else!
3768624 3772283 - Please, somebody! Not you!<br />- Stop moving!
3772391 3775879 No! Get your filthy<br />fucking hands off me!
3775990 3780150 Stop moving. Lady, I'm not<br />gonna fucking hurt you!
3785124 3787556 Okay. Okay.
3787658 3790180 Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.
3790291 3794087 I'm not gonna touch you.<br />But there's nobody else here yet
3794191 3796214 and that's gasoline there.
3797824 3801120 We need to get you<br />outta here right away. Okay?
3801224 3803417 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
3803524 3809286 Okay. I need to reach across your lap.<br />Can I do that, please?
3812491 3814457 Yeah. Yeah.
3815857 3817517 Thanks.
3821491 3825253 Is anything broken?
3825357 3827788 L-I don't think so.
3827890 3830788 Okay. Then that's good.
3830890 3833413 Are you... Are you<br />gonna get me out?
3833524 3836785 Yeah, I'm gonna get<br />you out. Okay?
3836890 3840220 Look at me. Look at me.<br />I'm gonna get you out.
3845591 3847886 Oh, fuck!
3847990 3850979 - I'm sorry.<br />- That's okay.
3853157 3855952 I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?
3856057 3858148 I'm gonna have to cut the belt.
3859124 3860749 It's okay, it's okay.
3860857 3863551 It's okay. Okay,<br />we're gonna get you out.
3863658 3865953 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />Look at me!
3866057 3868546 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />We're gonna get you outta here.
3868658 3870385 Everything's gonna be fine.
3888757 3889757 Ryan!
3924658 3926680 Pull!
3940591 3942614 It's okay.
3952090 3954386 It's okay.
3954491 3958116 All right.<br />It's okay, it's okay.
3958224 3960689 It's all right.<br />I got it. I got it.
3960790 3962847 Ma'am? Ma'am,<br />can you walk with me?
3962957 3965253 It's cool, it's cool.
3966657 3969680 Here we go. All right,<br />you're doin' great.
4000657 4004055 The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.<br />He really wanted to be here himself.
4004157 4006957 No, he didn't! If he did his own<br />dirty work none of us would have jobs.
4006990 4009252 - Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.<br />- Graham Waters.
4009357 4012187 - Thanks for coming in.<br />- He just pulled into the garage.
4012291 4015416 Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,<br />so we'll make this short.
4015524 4018887 Internal Affairs says this Conklin has two<br />suspicious shootings on his record.
4018990 4022252 Both black men. Both times he was cleared,<br />but only just.
4022357 4025152 Detective Lewis<br />makes black man number three.
4025257 4028711 You know any reason why we shouldn't<br />hang Conklin for this?
4028824 4033916 Well, it's more complicated<br />than we originally thought.
4034024 4039888 We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car<br />that Detective Lewis was driving.
4039990 4042115 Shit!
4042224 4046713 Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him<br />to stay in the car until he hears from me.
4046824 4050688 You found the money in the Mercedes.<br />I thought that wasn't his car.
4050790 4054620 The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley. We<br />haven't been able to get in touch with her.
4054723 4058212 Apparently she, uh,<br />left town this morning.
4058324 4062086 So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not<br />have known the money was in it.
4068457 4072116 You really think you're gonna<br />be able to make that fly?
4073357 4076414 Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.
4076523 4079490 - These names ring a bell, Detective?<br />- Yeah, vaguely.
4079590 4085080 We have attorneys for this slain<br />police officer camping in our offices.
4085191 4087918 We have his mother<br />and a half dozen men of the cloth
4088024 4090922 who swear that Lewis was one of<br />the twelve apostles of Christ.
4091024 4092490 We have two black city councilmen
4092590 4095852 and a congresswoman<br />who call on the hour, every hour,
4095957 4099355 demanding to know what the district<br />attorney intends to do about this.
4099457 4102480 And you want him to walk<br />into that press room
4102590 4105647 and tell them all that<br />the situation is complicated?
4110857 4112323 Give us a minute.
4113957 4116116 No problem.
4123623 4125816 Who knows about the money?
4125924 4127947 You gotta be kiddin' me.
4128057 4131921 There are only two people<br />in this room.
4132024 4135354 Myself, my partner,<br />Ferguson and Internal Affairs.
4135457 4137945 - Jim Ferguson?<br />- Yeah.
4142523 4144955 Okay. I guess<br />I don't see a problem.
4145057 4147599 As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money<br />isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing.
4147623 4150589 And even if it was, we aren't going to<br />prosecute a dead man.
4150690 4155146 Which means the money Internal Affairs<br />is holding can't be considered evidence.
4155257 4157552 You can do this dance<br />if you want to,
4157657 4161112 but I'm willing to bet when the<br />coroner's report comes back tomorrow
4161224 4164190 it's going to say that Detective Lewis<br />was coked out of his head.
4165623 4167089 Fucking black people, huh?
4167191 4169248 What did you just say?
4169357 4171323 I mean,
4171424 4173946 I know all the sociological<br />reasons why per capita
4174057 4177114 eight times more black men<br />are incarcerated than white men.
4177224 4181088 Schools are a disgrace. Lack of<br />opportunity. Bias in the judicial system.
4181191 4183157 All that stuff.<br />All that stuff!
4183257 4187314 But still, it's gotta get to you,<br />on a gut level as a black man.
4187423 4190356 They just can't keep their hands<br />out of the cookie jar.
4195057 4197614 Of course, you and I know<br />that's not the truth.
4197723 4199848 But that's the way<br />it always plays, doesn't it?
4199957 4203390 And assholes like Lewis keep feeding<br />the flames. It's gotta get to you.
4203490 4206945 What did you say<br />you did for the D.A. Again?
4207057 4208955 You coach ball down in Compton.<br />Am I right?
4209057 4210989 Oh, please, don't do that.
4211090 4213920 Don't act like you know<br />something about me, okay?
4214024 4217979 What do you think those kids need... to<br />make them believe, to give them hope?
4218090 4220681 You think they need another<br />drug-dealing cop
4220790 4223722 or do you think they need<br />a fallen black hero?
4223824 4228415 Why don't you cut through the bullshit<br />and just tell me what it is you want.
4230423 4233219 The D.A.'s squad loses<br />its lead investigator next month.
4233324 4237188 Rick is quite adamant that his replacement<br />be a person of color.
4237291 4241450 It's a high-profile position, and he wants<br />to send the right message to the community.
4241557 4245217 And the right message is,<br />"Look at this black boy I just bought?"
4245324 4250188 Well, fuck you very much.<br />But thanks for thinking of me.
4250291 4252756 Actually we were thinking of you.
4252857 4256051 Until we saw that.
4256157 4258214 It's your brother's file.
4258324 4261414 Twenty-something years old<br />and already three felonies.
4261523 4264251 Three strikes law. Kid's going away<br />for life for stealing a car.
4264356 4267016 Christ, that's a shitty law.
4267124 4269056 There's a warrant in there.
4269157 4273555 But still, hey, he had<br />every opportunity you had.
4274957 4278287 Fucking black people, huh?
4282623 4287079 So all, uh... all I need to do<br />to make this disappear
4287191 4289486 is to frame<br />a potentially innocent man?
4289590 4292886 What are you? The fucking defender<br />of all things white?
4292990 4296717 We're talking about a white man<br />who shot three black men.
4296824 4301552 And you're arguing with me that maybe<br />we're not being fair to him?
4301657 4304589 You know what? Maybe you're right.<br />Maybe Lewis did provoke this.
4304690 4306883 And maybe he got exactly<br />what was coming to him.
4306990 4309979 Or maybe stoned or not,<br />just being a black man in the Valley
4310090 4312385 was enough to get him killed.
4312490 4315888 There was no one there to see who<br />shot first, so there is no way to know.
4315990 4320116 Which means we<br />could get this wrong.
4321990 4325047 Maybe that's what happened<br />with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.
4325157 4329555 Maybe Lewis isn't the only one<br />who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
4329657 4332055 You're the one closest to all this.
4332157 4334180 You need to tell us.
4337990 4340421 What does your gut tell you?
4353157 4356350 So? Graham?
4356456 4358581 What do I tell 'em?
4358690 4362588 You tell me, and I'll tell them.
4369224 4373383 Well, I think given<br />Detective Conklin's history,
4373490 4376513 it's pretty clear<br />what happened last night.
4376623 4379282 Okay.
4395890 4398152 Before I get to why we're here,
4398256 4402189 I know that many of you have heard we had<br />our car stolen last night.
4402290 4406655 And as you could imagine, my wife and I<br />are both pretty shaken up.
4406757 4408586 But we're okay.
4408690 4413315 And Jean and I truly appreciate all<br />your calls and your concern. Thank you.
4413423 4419015 Now, just after 9.'00 p.m. Last night,<br />Detective William Lewis,
4419124 4421833 an eight-year veteran of the force and an<br />active member of the black community,
4421857 4425983 was gunned down<br />by a fellow officer.
4483824 4485653 Get outta the car!
4485757 4488222 Gimme the keys!<br />Get out... What the fuck?
4490223 4492246 Whoa! What the fuck<br />are you doing, man?
4492356 4494219 Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?
4494323 4497221 Say that again!
4497323 4499585 - Say that again!<br />- You stupid motherfucker!
4499690 4502986 Say it again, huh!<br />Call me a nigger again!
4503090 4505453 - Man, what the fuck? Get off!<br />- Fuck you!
4505557 4508318 - Shoot him!<br />- I'll blow your head off!
4508423 4511480 - Shoot this motherfucker!<br />- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!
4511590 4514056 Stop talkin' and shoot!
4514156 4517021 - Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.<br />- Get off of me!
4519123 4521885 Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!
4521990 4523956 - Oh, shit.<br />- Anthony! Anthony!
4526323 4527789 Get the fuck outta my car!
4527890 4530151 Shit! Damn!
4530256 4532496 - What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!<br />- Fuck you!
4536423 4540378 Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.<br />West bound.
4545990 4550319 2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...<br />Oh, Christ!
4555890 4558166 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- You get the fuck outta the car!
4558190 4560622 - Get outta the fucking car!<br />- It's my fucking car!
4560723 4563086 - It's my fucking gun!<br />- Fuck, it's my gun now!
4563190 4565383 Gimme my fucking gun!
4572545 4574340 Fuck!
4576078 4580011 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4582878 4586901 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4590178 4592736 Slowly step out of the vehicle.
4592845 4596538 - Get out of my car.<br />- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.
4599611 4603407 Turn off the engine.<br />Throw the keys out the window.
4616044 4619442 You fucking want me?<br />Here I am, you pig fuck!
4619545 4621010 Lie face down on the ground.
4621111 4623577 - Spread your arms and legs.<br />- No, you lie face down!
4623678 4625871 Don't come any closer!<br />Down on your knees!
4625977 4628375 Fuck you! What are you gonna do?<br />Pull the fucking trigger!
4628478 4629478 On your knees now!
4629545 4632238 You get on your knees<br />and suck my fucking dick!
4632344 4635139 Do I look like<br />I'm fucking joking with you?
4635244 4636888 That's what you look like,<br />a fucking joke to me.
4636912 4639187 - This man is making threatening gestures.<br />- Threatening gestures?
4639211 4641621 You wanna see a threatening gesture?<br />I got a threatening gesture.
4641645 4645338 - I know this man! I know this man!<br />- Get back.
4645445 4647967 - Give me some space. I know this guy.<br />- Get outta the way.
4648078 4649203 Step away.
4649311 4651300 Give me some goddamn room.<br />I know this guy.
4653178 4655736 - Man, don't walk up on me!<br />- See what's happening here?
4655845 4658037 Do you wanna die here, huh?<br />Is that what you want?
4658144 4660076 'Cause these guys<br />really wanna shoot you.
4660178 4662818 And the way you're acting,<br />they'll be completely fucking justified.
4662878 4664036 Fuck you!
4664144 4667304 Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.<br />You're the one.
4667411 4669639 'Cause you're the one whose head's<br />gonna be blown off
4669745 4671985 - and onto that man's patio.<br />- Officer Hanson, step away.
4672178 4675440 He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a<br />fucking friend! This man is not armed!
4675545 4678443 He's not gonna shoot you, me,<br />or anybody else, all right?
4678545 4680636 So give me two goddamn seconds.<br />Can you do that?
4680745 4684006 Lower your firearm.<br />Lower your firearm!
4689144 4692406 You startin' to understand<br />the situation?
4692511 4695238 What do you want from me?
4695344 4699868 Unless you think your wife is better off with<br />a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,
4699977 4701953 I want you to sit on that curb,<br />put your hands on your head
4701977 4704205 and do nothing until I speak<br />with these officers.
4704311 4707277 I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'<br />my hands on my head for nobody.
4707378 4711401 Then stand where you are and keep your<br />hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?
4714478 4716603 Yeah, I can do that.
4716712 4718973 Good.
4719078 4722875 I told this man to stay where he is<br />and keep his hands in plain sight.
4722977 4727740 This man better be related to you by blood<br />because this is fucking nuts.
4727845 4729935 I need this favor.
4730044 4734067 You can check the guy's name, his license.<br />He's got no priors, no warrants.
4734178 4736736 I need to let him go<br />with a warning.
4736845 4741777 - What kind of fucking warning?<br />- A harsh warning.
4744344 4746207 Thank you.
4749011 4753068 You've been warned. Do you understand me?<br />Do you understand me!
4753178 4756440 You want something from me?<br />'Cause I'm right here.
4756545 4760602 - I'm trying to help you.<br />- I didn't ask for your help, did I?
4762745 4764937 Go home.
4768578 4770907 Yeah, that I can do.
4849344 4851242 Look at me.
4852712 4855371 You embarrass me.
4855478 4857569 You embarrass yourself.
4900178 4901667 Daddy's home!
4921578 4923601 - What's up?<br />- Give me my money!
4923711 4926143 - What? What money?<br />- Daddy!
4926244 4929540 - To pay for my store. Give me my money!<br />- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!
4929645 4930940 Give me my money!
4932611 4935770 - I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!<br />- That's not my truck!
4935877 4938207 - Daddy?<br />- Elizabeth!
4938311 4942573 Hey, you know what?<br />Hey, I got $50. Here.
4942677 4944973 Fifty dollars?<br />You took everything!
4945078 4948874 - Mommy?<br />- I'm coming, I'm coming!
4948977 4953239 - He doesn't have it.<br />- Hasn't got what?
4953344 4958572 I have it. He doesn't<br />have the impenetrable cloak!
4958677 4960337 Lara, stay outta the street!
4987911 4991605 - It's okay, Daddy.<br />- What... What?
4991711 4993177 I'll protect you.
5020411 5023104 It's okay. Daddy's okay.
5023211 5026200 It's a really good cloak.
5107344 5109071 How's it goin'
5134844 5139799 I sent her out for groceries,<br />and that was two hours ago, Carol.
5139911 5141843 Well, you are one to talk.
5141944 5145808 You go through, like,<br />six housekeepers a year?
5145911 5149241 I'm not snapping at you!<br />I am angry.
5150510 5152567 Yes! At them! Yes!
5152677 5157007 At them, the police,<br />at Rick, at Maria,
5157111 5160804 at the dry cleaners<br />who destroyed another blouse today,
5160911 5164604 at the gardener who keeps<br />over-watering the lawn.
5164711 5165711 I...
5167378 5169900 I just thought that...
5170011 5173602 Carol, I just thought that<br />I would wake up today
5173711 5176677 and I would feel better,<br />you know?
5176777 5180766 But I was still mad.<br />And I realized...
5180877 5184775 I realized that it had nothing to do<br />with my car being stolen.
5186811 5190573 I wake up like this<br />every morning!
5190677 5194632 I am angry all the time,<br />and I don't know why.
5194744 5198074 Carol, I don't know why!<br />And I...
5199744 5202869 Yeah, yeah, call me back.
5202977 5204840 Bye.
5315844 5317707 Really appreciate this.
5317811 5320073 No problem.
5325911 5327853 So how long you been<br />out there tonight? It's cold.
5327877 5330070 Hour maybe.
5330178 5331871 Big surprise, huh?
5331977 5335239 Yeah, this ain't exactly<br />"pick up a brother" territory.
