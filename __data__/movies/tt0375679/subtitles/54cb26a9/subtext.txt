169522 171438 <i>It's the sense of touch.</i>
173188 174271 <i>What?</i>
176563 180520 <i>Any real city, you walk, you know?</i>
180604 183479 <i>You brush past people.<br />People bump into you.</i>
184603 186687 <i>In LA, nobody touches you.</i>
190187 192978 We're always behind this metal and glass.
195020 198102 I think we miss that touch so much
198186 201769 that we crash into each other<br />just so we can feel something.
203852 205311 You guys okay?
206269 208227 I think he hit his head.
208977 211102 <i>You don't think that's true?</i>
211269 213101 <i>Stay in your car.</i>
213268 215934 <i>Graham, I think we got rear-ended.</i>
216018 218351 <i>I think we spun around twice.</i>
218435 222101 And somewhere in there,<br />one of us lost our frame of reference.
223351 225475 And I'm gonna go look for it.
228184 230725 <i>-Calm down, ma'am.<br />-I am calm!</i>
230809 232808 I need to see your registration<br />and insurance.
232892 235100 Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!
235184 236933 -She do this!<br />-My fault?
237017 239099 Ma'am, you really need to wait<br />in your vehicle.
239183 241099 -My fault?<br />-Stop in middle of street!
241183 242849 Mexicans no know how to drive.
242933 247557 <i>-She Blake too fast.<br />-I "Blake" too fast? I "Blake" too fast.</i>
247641 250599 -I'm sorry you no see my "Blake" light.<br />-Ma'am.
250683 254389 See, I stop when I see a long line of cars<br />stopped in front of me.
254473 257264 Maybe you see over steering wheel,<br />you "Blake" too!
257348 258514 -Ma'am!<br />-Crazy Mexican.
258598 260598 I call immigration on you.<br />Look what you do my car.
260682 262556 <i>Officer, can you please write down<br />in your report</i>
262640 264431 <i>how shocked I am to be hit<br />by an Asian driver.</i>
264515 267639 <i>-Ma'am!<br />-Ma'am, no. See, it's Detective…</i>
272347 275306 All right. You've got to calm down.
283680 287138 -Hey, Detective. Nice entrance.<br />-Fuck you.
290680 294761 -Hey, you okay?<br />-I'm freezing.
294845 298053 Shit. I heard it might snow.
298137 300428 -Get out of here.<br />-That's what I heard.
300512 303012 -You got a smoke?<br />-No. I quit.
303679 305137 Yeah, me, too.
306470 308969 -What do you got?<br />-Dead kid.
319011 320428 Hey, Bob.
362340 365190 You get one free box of ammunition.<br />What kind do you want?
378173 379630 Yo, Osama!
379714 382464 Plan a jihad on your own time.<br />What do you want?
387006 389713 -Are you making insult at me?<br />-Am I making insult "at" you?
389797 391213 Is that the closest<br />you can come to English?
391297 393254 Yes, I speak English!<br />I am American citizen.
393338 395421 -Oh, God, here we go.<br />-I have right like you.
395505 397629 -I have right to buy gun.<br />-Not in my store, you don't.
397713 400004 -Andy, get him out of here now!<br />-Dad, go wait in the car.
400088 401172 Now. Get out!
402172 403462 You're an ignorant man!
403546 405670 Oh, yeah, I'm ignorant?<br />You're liberating my country
405754 408962 and I'm flying 747s into your mud huts<br />and incinerating your friends?
409046 411003 -Get the fuck out of my store!<br />-No, you get the fuck!
411087 412253 -Now, come on.<br />-Get out!
412337 413920 No, don't touch me! He cheat me this man!
414004 415796 -Andy, now!<br />-Come on, let's go.
416503 417545 Okay.
421045 423711 You can give me the gun<br />or give me back the money.
423795 426336 And I am really hoping for the money.
431710 434251 -What kind of ammunition do you want?<br />-Whatever fits.
434335 436335 Oh, we got a lot of kinds.
436585 438918 We got long colts,<br />short colts, ball heads,
439002 441543 flat nose, hollow points, wide cutters,
441627 443959 and a dozen more<br />that'll fit any size hole.
445126 448626 Just depends upon<br />how much bang you can handle.
451793 454126 I'll take the ones in the red box.
456376 459167 -You know what those are?<br />-Can I have them?
468833 470374 Did you see any white people in there
470458 473248 waiting an hour and 32 minutes<br />for a plate of spaghetti, huh?
473332 474998 And how many cups of coffee did we get?
475082 477623 You don't drink coffee,<br />and I didn't want any.
477707 479957 Man, that woman in there<br />poured cup after cup
480041 481748 to every single white person around us,
481832 484373 but did she even ask you<br />if you wanted any?
484457 486956 We didn't get any coffee<br />that you didn't want and I didn't order,
487040 489414 and that's evidence<br />of racial discrimination?
489498 491372 Did you notice that<br />our waitress was black?
491456 493831 And black women<br />don't think in stereotypes?
493915 494914 You tell me something, man.
494998 497706 When was the last time you met one<br />who didn't think she knew everything
497790 500830 about your little, lazy ass<br />before you even opened your mouth, huh?
500914 502871 That waitress sized us up in two seconds.
502955 506746 We're black, and black people don't tip.<br />So she wasn't gonna waste her time.
506830 510038 Now, somebody like that,<br />nothing you can do to change their mind.
510122 512454 Yeah, well, how much did you leave?
512538 514954 You expect me to pay<br />for that kind of service?
515413 516496 What?
516704 519204 What the fuck is you laughing at, man?
519288 522162 I'm seriously starting to think<br />that you're jealous of Karen.
522246 524537 Hardly. I'd just like to see you<br />get through a meal
524621 526411 without calling her<br />or anyone else for that matter.
526495 528244 Okay, look, no more phone calls tonight.
528328 531078 As a matter of fact,<br />here, you can hold the battery.
531162 532245 Okay?
534578 536994 $10 says she calls you in the car.
537078 539785 Wait, wait, wait.<br />You see what that woman just did?
539869 541827 -You see that?<br />-Why, she's cold.
541911 544702 She got colder<br />as soon as she saw us, dawg.
545161 548410 -Oh, man, come on, don't start.<br />-Man, look around you, man.
548494 551952 You couldn't find a whiter, safer<br />or better-lit part of this city right now.
552036 554117 But yet this white woman<br />sees two black guys
554201 556951 who look like UCLA students<br />strolling down the sidewalk,
557035 559285 and her reaction is blind fear?
559576 562076 I mean, look at us, dawg.<br />Are we dressed like gangbangers?
562160 565534 Huh? No. Do we look threatening? No.
565618 569533 Fact. If anybody<br />should be scared around here, it's us.
569617 573616 We're the only two black faces surrounded<br />by a sea of over-caffeinated white people
573700 576116 patrolled by the trigger-happy LAPD.
576200 578950 So you tell me. Why aren't we scared?
580199 581908 'Cause we got guns?
582283 583949 You could be right.
587116 589240 -Get the fuck out of the car!<br />-Give me the keys!
589324 591282 -Come on. Hurry up!<br />-Okay, okay, okay, okay.
591366 592407 Get down!
592491 594239 -No, no! Please!<br />-Don't look at me!
594323 596906 Motherfuck, I said don't look at me.<br />Turn around!
596990 600282 Move. Let's go, come on.<br />We're good. We're fine. Just keep moving.
605657 609655 No, no, no! Take that voodoo-ass thing<br />off of there right now.
609739 612238 I know you just didn't call<br />Saint Christopher voodoo.
612322 614363 Man's the patron saint of travelers, dawg.
614447 617072 You had a conversation with God, huh?<br />What did God say?
617156 618363 "Go forth, my son,
618447 621987 "and leave big slobbery suction rings<br />on every dashboard you find?"
622071 623362 Why the hell do you do that?
623446 626196 Look at the way your crazy ass drive,<br />then ask me again.
633571 636070 Chevy pickup and Mercedes<br />driving north on Balboa.
636154 638903 Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the<br />Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.
638987 641403 Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup<br />is a cop coming off shift.
641487 643695 Wait a minute,<br />this Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
643779 646445 Yeah. Name's Conklin.<br />He's a narc out of Wilshire.
646529 648112 I got the Mercedes.
648944 652569 Mercedes takes a shot at him.<br />Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.
652653 655803 Mercedes rolls to a stop.<br />Driver opens the door, falls out dead.
656778 659610 He looks very relaxed<br />for just having shot somebody.
659694 661319 He says he kept trying to drive away.
661403 663901 The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,<br />screaming, waving a gun.
663985 665943 Shot back in self-defense.
666443 670277 -Anybody actually see who shot first?<br />-They just heard two bangs.
670902 672568 Find me a witness.
686401 688776 That is a nice gun.
689400 693150 Well, the car's registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
694025 695775 And that's not Cindy.
696191 699232 That is a William Lewis.
699316 702316 Found it under the front seat.<br />Hollywood division.
706482 710149 Looks like Detective Conklin shot himself<br />the wrong nigger.
721856 725022 -How much longer are you gonna be?<br />-This is the last one.
725106 726398 Thank you.
735605 738604 You don't think reporters<br />listen to police calls?
738688 740480 I need to talk to you for a second.
741647 744062 You just give me a minute, all right?
744479 747021 -And find Flanagan, will you? Now.<br />-Yes, sir.
749021 750103 Yes, honey?
750187 752062 I want the locks changed again<br />in the morning.
752146 753145 You want…
753229 755895 Look, why don't you just go lie down, huh?<br />Have you checked on James?
755979 757519 Well, of course I've checked on James.
757603 759436 I've checked on him every five minutes<br />since we've been home.
759520 761269 -Do not patronize me.<br />-I'm…
761353 763894 I want the locks changed again<br />in the morning.
763978 766769 It's okay. Just go to bed.
766853 770144 You know what, didn't I just ask you<br />not to treat me like a child?
770228 772019 I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
773435 774810 Is okay I go home now?
774894 776643 It's fine.<br />Thank you very much for staying, Maria.
776727 777810 You're welcome. No problem.
777894 779060 -Good night, Miss Jean.<br />-Good night.
779144 780935 We'll see you tomorrow.
781477 785225 I would like the locks changed again<br />in the morning.
785309 787975 And you know what?<br />You might mention that we'd appreciate it
788059 789809 if next time<br />they didn't send a gang member.
789893 791142 -A gang member?<br />-Yes, yes.
791226 792559 -What, you mean that kid in there?<br />-Yes.
792643 795892 The guy in there with the shaved head, the<br />pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.
795976 797017 Those are not prison tattoos.
797101 798891 Oh, really?<br />And he's not gonna go sell our key
798975 801141 to one of his gangbanger friends<br />the moment he is out our door?
801225 802474 We've had a really tough night.
802558 804683 I think it'd be best<br />if you just went upstairs right now…
804767 806266 And, what? Wait for them to break in?
806350 809391 I just had a gun pointed in my face.
809475 810683 You lower your voice!
810767 813557 And it was my fault<br />because I knew it was gonna happen.
813641 816557 But if a white person<br />sees two black men walking towards her,
816641 820057 and she turns and walks in the<br />other direction, she's a racist, right?
820141 822473 Well, I got scared and<br />I didn't say anything.
822557 825390 And ten seconds later<br />I had a gun in my face!
825474 826556 Now, I am telling you.
826640 829472 Your amigo in there is gonna sell our key<br />to one of his homies.
829556 831644 And this time it'd be really fucking great
831728 834056 if you acted like you<br />actually gave a shit!
861679 863679 All right, what have we got?<br />Talk to me, Karen.
863763 865720 Flanagan doesn't think<br />anybody has the story yet.
865804 868428 I'm the goddamn District Attorney<br />of Los Angeles.
868512 871345 If my car gets jacked,<br />it's gonna make news.
871928 873012 Fuck!
875262 878345 Why did these guys have to be black?<br />I mean, why?
879095 880677 No matter how we spin this thing,
880761 883760 I'm either gonna lose the black vote<br />or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
883844 885343 You know, I think you're worrying<br />too much.
885427 888094 You have a lot of support<br />in the black community.
889136 892093 All right. If we can't duck this thing,<br />we're gonna have to neutralize it.
892177 896593 What we need is a picture of me<br />pinning a medal on a black man.
897218 898385 Bruce?
900218 903009 The firefighter.<br />The one who saved the camp or something.
903093 904676 Northridge. What's his name?
904760 906093 He's Iraqi.
907093 908300 He's Iraqi?
908925 910508 Well, he looks black.
910592 913841 He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.<br />His name's Saddam Khahum.
913925 916508 Saddam? His name's Saddam?
916592 918175 Well, that's real good, Bruce.
918259 921549 Yeah, I'm gonna pin a medal<br />on an Iraqi named Saddam.
921633 923299 Give yourself a raise, will you?
926383 929258 It's been good doing business with you.
929966 933215 -How soon can I have them?<br />-I'm picking them up right now.
933299 936756 Look, you're not listening to me.<br />This is an emergency.
936840 939298 I keep telling you he's in pain.<br />He can't sleep.
939382 943881 Mr. Ryan, your father has been to<br />the clinic three times in the last month.
943965 946881 He is being treated<br />for a urinary tract infection.
946965 949297 <i>That is by no means an emergency.</i>
949381 952880 Now, if you have any more questions<br />about your HMO plan,
952964 955922 why don't you make an appointment<br />to come in between 10:00 and 4:00,
956006 957213 Monday through Friday?
957297 959380 What does my father do<br />about sleeping tonight?
959464 961338 I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
961422 964129 -I wanna talk to your supervisor.<br />-I am my supervisor.
964213 966837 -Yeah, what is your name?<br />-Shaniqua Johnson.
966921 969212 Shaniqua. Big fucking surprise that is.
969296 970338 Oh…
985295 987670 <i>…1005 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.</i>
987754 990710 <i>Vehicle described as a black,<br />late-model Lincoln Navigator.</i>
990794 995085 <i>California plates, 4<br />Peter Charles Ida 315.</i>

1006752 1008210 That's not it.
1009335 1011668 That's not the vehicle, John.<br />The plates don't match.
1011752 1015552 The driver's gotta be 40, and nobody<br />jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.
1020834 1022834 They were doing something.
1066789 1068206 Enthusiastic.
1069873 1072580 Keep your hands<br />where I can see them, please.
1072955 1076371 I'm gonna need to see your<br />driver's license and registration.
1076455 1079121 No problem. I'm gonna have to
1079205 1082121 reach inside of the glove compartment<br />to get the registration.
1082205 1084496 -Is that okay?<br />-Nice and slow, please.
1084580 1085662 Okay.
1090787 1092412 How are you tonight, Officer?
1093287 1094662 Excellent.
1096287 1097704 Here you go.
1101786 1104078 Stay inside the vehicle, please.
1112619 1114660 Let's do it again right now.
1115619 1117910 Step out of the car, please, sir.
1118535 1121701 Wait, wait a minute, Officer.<br />I haven't been drinking or anything.
1121785 1123368 Then we shouldn't have a problem.
1123452 1126367 He doesn't drink.<br />He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.
1126451 1128034 No, it's okay.
1128534 1129868 It's fine.
1135076 1137159 Step onto the sidewalk, sir.
1138784 1140742 That's good. Right there.
1142658 1143783 Look at me.
1145200 1147408 I want you to stand on your right foot.
1147492 1150825 Touch your nose<br />with the index finger of your left hand.
1155824 1157865 I told you he doesn't drink.
1157949 1161365 Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you one time<br />to stay in the vehicle.
1161449 1163865 -Ma'am?<br />-Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.
1163949 1165157 Don't you "ma'am" me.
1165241 1167197 Who the hell do you think<br />you're talking to?
1167281 1170364 Look, Officer,<br />my wife has had a couple of drinks…
1170448 1171864 All right, both of you turn around.
1171948 1173781 Put your hands on top of your head<br />and interlock your fingers.
1173865 1175947 No, wait. Wait a minute.<br />We're only a block away from our house.
1176031 1177197 Hands on your head.<br />Interlock your fingers.
1177281 1178697 -That's not even necessary.<br />-Hands on your head.
1178781 1179739 Interlock your fingers.
1179823 1181697 Look, I'm a television director.
1181989 1184155 Me and my wife were just coming home<br />from an awards show.
1184239 1186446 Get your hands off him.<br />He has done nothing wrong.
1186530 1188196 Put your hands on top of your head, ma'am.
1188280 1190155 -Will you just do what he says?<br />-Fuck you!
1190239 1191946 Put your hands on top of your head, ma'am.
1192030 1194280 And you keep<br />your filthy fucking hands off me!
1194446 1197363 -You motherfucking pig!<br />-Christine, just stop talking.
1197863 1199821 That's quite a mouth you have.
1200446 1201820 Of course you know that.
1201904 1204654 Fuck you!<br />That's what this is all about, isn't it?
1204946 1207029 You thought you saw<br />a white woman blowing a black man,
1207113 1208736 and that just<br />drove your little cracker ass crazy.
1208820 1210694 Will you just shut your fucking mouth?
1210778 1213195 I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.
1213612 1215362 Put your legs open.
1217653 1221528 Now, do you have any guns or knives<br />or anything I might get stuck with?
1221902 1224152 I'm wearing a cocktail dress.<br />What do you think?
1224236 1226777 You'd be surprised some of the places<br />I've found weapons.
1226861 1228236 He's clean.
1229444 1232236 What do you think we should do about this,<br />Mr. Thayer?
1233444 1237067 My partner and I just witnessed your wife<br />performing fellatio on you
1237151 1239776 while you were operating a motor vehicle.
1239860 1243651 That's reckless endangerment,<br />which, incidentally, is a felony.
1245318 1247317 Now we can charge your wife here
1247401 1250817 with lewd conduct<br />and performing a sexual act in public.
1252150 1254567 Now you say you're a block from home.
1255859 1257817 Now, we could use our discretion
1258275 1260192 and let you go with a warning,
1260900 1263899 or we can cuff you<br />and put you in the back of the car.
1266274 1268566 What do you think we should do, sir?
1276732 1278232 Look, we're sorry…
1280440 1284565 …and we would appreciate if you would<br />just let us go with a warning, please.
1289773 1291897 The man's apologizing, Tommy.
1293356 1296231 I think we can let him go. Don't you?
1298939 1300022 Yeah.
1300522 1301814 All right.
1303522 1304855 You can go.
1314896 1316980 You folks drive safe now, huh?
1351102 1352685 Let's go, Tommy.
1361767 1363517 It won't close.
1364559 1365892 I can do that.
1365976 1367850 Dad, you couldn't even get it open.
1367934 1370434 Have respect for your father.<br />Give me the gun.
1371517 1374307 Here. Now you can shoot anybody you want.
1374391 1377182 Dorri, that man could've<br />killed your mother.
1377266 1380557 You think I should let crazy people<br />do what they want to us?
1380641 1382766 Farhad, it won't close.
1386932 1389390 Dorri, you should be at work.
1401639 1403347 Who are you calling?
1403431 1406306 I'm gonna report their asses.<br />Sons of bitches.
1406598 1409930 You actually believe they're gonna take<br />anything you have to say seriously?
1410014 1414054 Do you have any idea how that felt?<br />To have that pig's hands all over me?
1414138 1416055 And you just stood there.
1418222 1419846 And then you apologized to him?
1419930 1423013 I mean, what did you want me to do?<br />Get us both shot?
1423097 1426720 They were gonna shoot us<br />on Ventura Boulevard? Pathetic.
1426804 1430303 Yeah, well, maybe you would've<br />been satisfied with just being arrested.
1430387 1434512 Oh, I get it. Much better to let him<br />shove his hand up my crotch
1434596 1436762 than get your name in the paper.
1437429 1439178 You know, you finally got me figured out,
1439262 1442344 'cause see, that's exactly<br />what I was worried about, right there.
1442428 1445636 Oh, and it wasn't? You weren't afraid<br />that all your good friends at the studio
1445720 1447844 were gonna read about you in the morning<br />and realize that,
1447928 1450011 you know what, he's actually black?
1451345 1452969 You need to calm down right now.
1453053 1456551 No, what I need is a husband<br />who will not just stand there
1456635 1458176 while I am being molested!
1458260 1461719 I mean, they were cops, for God's sakes!<br />They had guns!
1462760 1465676 You know what? Maybe I<br />should've let them arrest your ass.
1465760 1470342 I mean, sooner or later you gotta find out<br />what it is really like to be black.
1470426 1472550 Fuck you, man. Like you know.
1472634 1476175 The closest you ever came to being black,<br />Cameron, was watching <i>The Cosby Show.</i>
1476259 1479592 Yeah, well, at least I wasn't watching it<br />with the rest of the equestrian team.
1479676 1480842 Yeah, you're right, Cameron.
1480926 1484383 I got a lot to learn 'cause I haven't<br />quite learned how to shuck and jive.
1484467 1487966 Let me hear it again.<br />"Thank you, Mr. Policeman.
1488050 1490508 "You sure is mighty kind<br />to us poor black folk.
1490592 1494467 "You be sure to let me know next time<br />you wanna finger-fuck my wife."
1496591 1499549 How the fuck do you say<br />something like that to me?
1500757 1502466 You know, fuck you!
1504132 1507432 That's good. A little anger.<br />It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!
1557420 1559545 -How's it going?<br />-Okay.
1560753 1562835 You didn't get scared or something,<br />did you?
1562919 1566127 There's no monsters in the closet, right?<br />'Cause I hate monsters.
1566211 1569627 -There's no such thing as monsters.<br />-Oh, that's a good thing.
1570752 1572377 I heard a bang.
1572669 1574294 Like a truck bang?
1574877 1576211 Like a gun.
1583293 1586918 That's funny, because we moved out<br />of that bad neighborhood.
1587085 1589835 And there's not too many guns around here.
1591500 1593375 How far can bullets go?
1593917 1595584 They go pretty far.
1595917 1598875 But they usually get stuck in something<br />and stop.
1598959 1600667 What if they don't?
1602000 1605041 You thinking about that bullet<br />that came through your window?
1607708 1610208 Because we never did find it, did we?
1610583 1613458 I think it didn't see me<br />'cause I was under the covers.
1615791 1618873 And you think it was that same bullet<br />that you heard tonight?
1622332 1625331 -You think we should move again?<br />-I like it here.
1625415 1628415 Me, too. But if that bullet found out<br />where we lived…
1629123 1630581 Oh, hold on.
1630665 1631747 What?
1631831 1634581 So stupid! How can I forget?
1635206 1636289 What?
1638372 1640205 No, forget it. You ain't gonna believe me.
1640289 1641497 Tell me.
1642706 1643747 Okay.
1645246 1648871 When I was five,<br />this fairy came into my room one night.
1648955 1649996 Right.
1650080 1652121 See, I told you<br />you weren't gonna believe me.
1652205 1655080 -Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.<br />-No, tell me.
1656330 1657371 Okay.
1658662 1663204 So this fairy comes into my room and<br />I'm like, "Yeah, right, you're a fairy."
1663954 1665995 Anyway, we're talking, you know.
1666079 1669661 And she's flying all around the room,<br />knocking down all my posters and stuff.
1669745 1671203 She was flying?
1671287 1672726 Yeah, but she had these little stubby
1672810 1674619 wings.<br />She could've glued them on, you know?
1674703 1677327 Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.
1677411 1679369 So she said, "I'll prove it."
1679453 1681785 So she reaches into her backpack,
1681869 1684285 and she pulls out this invisible cloak.
1684369 1688243 She ties it around my neck,<br />and she tells me that it's impenetrable.
1689035 1691077 You know what "impenetrable" means?
1691452 1693701 It means that nothing can go through it.
1693785 1695535 No bullets. Nothing.
1695785 1699327 She told me that if I wore it,<br />nothing would hurt me.
1699742 1700951 So I did.
1701201 1705409 And my whole life,<br />I never got shot, stabbed. Nothing.
1706159 1707826 I mean, how weird is that?
1708784 1710617 Only she told me<br />that I was supposed to give it
1710701 1713283 to my daughter on her fifth birthday<br />and I forgot.
1714116 1715658 Can I touch it?
1716158 1717658 Sure, go ahead.
1719741 1722450 -I don't feel it.<br />-Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?
1723116 1725366 If you want I can take it off<br />and tie it around your shoulders.
1725450 1727365 She told me how to do it.
1727449 1729698 Unless you think it's stupid then…
1729782 1732699 -Don't you need it?<br />-No, not anymore.
1734157 1736532 So what do you think? You want it?
1742448 1744531 Okay, let's get out of here.
1750406 1751448 Okay.
1765530 1767155 Hold your chin up.
1772862 1774696 Okay. Is that too tight?
1775404 1777196 Do you feel anything at all?
1778571 1780946 Good. Then it's just right.
1787820 1789694 Do I take it off when I have a bath?
1789778 1793986 No, you leave it on all the time.<br />Until you have a daughter.
1794070 1797277 When she turns five,<br />then you give it to her.
1798235 1799319 Okay?
1800152 1801152 Okay.
1803444 1804527 Okay.
1806069 1808859 -Good night, sweetie.<br />-Good night.
1849565 1853689 No, no. You wanna listen to music<br />of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.
1853773 1857481 How in the lunacy of your mind<br />is hip-hop music of the oppressor?
1857565 1860647 Listen to it, man.<br />"Nigger this, nigger that."
1860731 1864146 You think white people go around<br />calling each other honkies all day, man?
1864230 1865855 Hey, honky, how's business?
1865939 1868188 Going great, cracker. We're diversifying.
1868272 1871230 How about this, huh? How about that?<br />Listen to that. You like that?
1871314 1872771 Man's singing about lynching niggers.
1872855 1874980 And you think there's a difference,<br />don't you? Huh?
1875064 1878729 <i>♪ Gonna buy me a rope<br />and lynch me a nigger ♪</i>
1878813 1881979 You got absolutely no idea<br />where hip-hop music comes from, do you?
1882063 1884229 <i>♪ I'd shoot them dead first<br />but I done broke my trigger ♪</i>
1884313 1887229 You see, back in the '60s<br />we had smart, articulate black men.
1887313 1889395 <i>♪ Gonna get out my sheet<br />put my hood on my head ♪</i>
1889479 1892394 Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,<br />Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.
1892478 1893853 <i>♪ Gonna string them up good ♪</i>
1893937 1896353 These brothers were speaking out,<br />and people were listening!
1896437 1897561 <i>♪ Then they'll be dead ♪</i>
1897645 1899811 And then the FBI said,<br />"Oh, no, we can't have that."
1899895 1901853 <i>♪ In the home of the brave<br />and the land of the free ♪</i>
1901937 1905435 "I know, let's give the niggers this music<br />by a bunch of mumbling idiots
1905519 1907143 "and sooner or later,<br />they'll all copy it,"
1907227 1909893 "and nobody will be able to understand<br />a fucking word they say."
1909977 1911186 "End of problem."
1918935 1921101 What the fuck was that, dawg?
1934934 1936225 Holy shit!
1936725 1939350 -What?<br />-Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.
1939725 1941808 You're saying there's a Chinaman<br />under this truck?
1941892 1943225 What part don't you understand?
1943309 1946433 There's a Chinaman<br />stuck underneath the fucking truck.
1948224 1949516 Help me.
1951891 1953515 Oh, God.
1953599 1956599 What the hell did he do,<br />just leap out in front of the truck?
1956683 1958806 Man, this is so completely fucked up.
1958890 1961181 Oh, really? No shit!
1961265 1963682 Okay, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up.
1964432 1966014 -Get back in the truck.<br />-What?
1966098 1968806 -Yes, get back in the truck.<br />-You think we didn't drag him far enough?
1968890 1971639 No, no we gonna drive away.<br />And he gonna let go.
1971723 1973972 He's not gonna let go, Anthony.<br />You know why?
1974056 1977097 Because he's stuck underneath<br />the fucking truck!
1977181 1978347 Now, if he could've let go,
1978431 1981638 he probably would've considered<br />that option about a half a block back.
1981722 1983347 Now, what you and I gotta do,
1983431 1985430 just grab his arms<br />and pull him from underneath.
1985514 1987262 You grab his arm, it's gonna fall off.
1987346 1990679 Then you gonna be standing in the middle<br />of the street holding a Chinaman's arm.
1990763 1992471 Then what your ass gonna do, huh?
1992555 1996763 If we leave this man here, he dies.<br />Then we're up for murder charges.
1997263 2000012 Now just grab his arm.<br />Why not just pull him out?
2005679 2007595 I don't wanna<br />cause any problems, Lieutenant.
2007679 2009136 I just want a new partner.
2009220 2011595 I understand.<br />Your partner's a racist prick.
2011679 2013927 But you don't wanna stir up<br />any bad feelings with him.
2014011 2016094 Well, he's been on<br />the force for a long time.
2016178 2019428 -Seventeen years.<br />-And I do have to work here, sir.
2020011 2022635 So you don't mind<br />that there's a racist prick on the force.
2022719 2025635 You just don't want<br />him to ride in your car.
2025719 2028509 If you need me to go on record<br />about this, sir, I will.
2028593 2031177 That'd be great. Write a full report.
2031427 2033634 Because I'm anxious to understand<br />how an obvious bigot
2033718 2036468 could've gone undetected<br />in this department for 17 years,
2036552 2038968 11 of which he was under<br />my personal supervision,
2039052 2041717 which doesn't speak very highly<br />of my managerial skills.
2041801 2045092 But that's not your concern.<br />I can't wait to read it.
2045801 2048842 What if I said I wanted a new partner<br />for personal reasons?
2048926 2050675 So now you're saying<br />he's not a racist prick,
2050759 2052676 you just don't like him.
2053259 2056008 -Yes, sir.<br />-That's not a good enough reason.
2056258 2059091 Well, then, I guess I should think<br />of a better one and get back to you.
2059175 2061550 So you think<br />I'm asking you to make one up.
2062133 2065341 No, sir.<br />I just can't think of one right now.
2066258 2068340 You wanna know what I heard?
2069840 2072340 I heard it was a case<br />of uncontrollable flatulence.
2072757 2075756 -You want me to say he has flatulence?<br />-Not him. You.
2075840 2077340 You have uncontrollable flatulence.
2077424 2079173 You're too embarrassed<br />to ride with anybody else,
2079257 2080840 so you're requesting a one-man car.
2080924 2083839 I'm not…<br />comfortable with that, Lieutenant.
2083923 2085297 I wouldn't be either.
2085381 2087297 Which is why I understand<br />your need for privacy.
2087381 2090797 Just like I'm sure you understand how<br />hard a black man has to work to get to,
2090881 2094505 say, where I am, in a racist fucking<br />organization like the LAPD
2094589 2096838 and how easily that can be taken away.
2096922 2099963 Now, that being said, it's your decision.
2100213 2104463 You can put your career and mine<br />on the line in pursuit of a just cause,
2105213 2108422 or you can admit to having<br />an embarrassing problem
2109046 2110837 of a personal nature.
2115754 2116837 Fuck.
2147377 2148669 Excuse me.
2149710 2151209 Excuse me. Sir?
2152418 2154918 -You finished?<br />-I replaced the lock.
2155168 2157293 But you got a real problem with that door.
2158168 2161209 -You fix the lock?<br />-No, I replaced the lock.
2161751 2165416 -But you gotta fix that door.<br />-Just fix the lock.
2165500 2167583 Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.
2167667 2170625 What you need is a new door.
2171042 2173125 -I need new door?<br />-Yeah.
2173583 2176125 Okay. How much?
2176792 2178123 I don't…
2178207 2180832 Sir, you're gonna have to call somebody<br />that sells doors.
2180916 2184582 You try to cheat me, right, huh?<br />You have a friend that fix door?
2184666 2186582 No, I don't have a<br />friend that fix doors, bro.
2186666 2189498 Then go and fix the fucking lock,<br />you cheater.
2189582 2191747 You… You know what?
2191831 2194997 Why don't you just pay for the lock,<br />and I won't charge you for the time.
2195081 2198247 You don't fix the lock! I pay?<br />What, you think I'm stupid?
2198331 2200914 You fix the fucking lock, you cheater!
2200998 2202956 Hey, I'd appreciate it<br />if you'd stop calling me names.
2203040 2205621 -Then fix the fucking lock!<br />-I replaced the lock!
2205705 2209872 -You gotta fix the fucking door!<br />-You cheat! You fucking cheater!
2210497 2212872 -Fine. Don't pay.<br />-What?
2213997 2216496 -Have a good night.<br />-What? No. Wait!
2216580 2219620 Wait! You come back here!<br />You fix the lock!
2219704 2223371 Come here! You fix my lock!<br />Fix the fucking lock!
2229288 2230579 No, I understand.
2230663 2233453 You run over a Chinaman,<br />stuff him in the back,
2233537 2236453 then bring the truck here<br />so I can share in the experience.
2236537 2239286 Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.<br />It'll wash right off.
2239370 2240911 Georgie, burn this thing.
2240995 2244286 Burn it? It's a brand-new Navigator.<br />All you need is a little piece of carpet.
2244370 2246702 You watch the Discovery Channel?
2246869 2249702 -Not a lot.<br />-They got some good shit on that channel.
2249786 2253410 Every night there is a show<br />with somebody shining a little blue light
2253494 2255773 and finding tiny specks<br />of blood splattered
2255857 2257868 on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,
2257952 2262368 bathroom fixtures and special-edition<br />plastic Burger King tray cups.
2262951 2266117 Then the next thing they show<br />is some stupid redneck in handcuffs
2266201 2269868 who looks absolutely stunned<br />that this is happening to him.
2270201 2273658 Sometimes the redneck<br />is actually watching the Discovery Channel
2273742 2275616 when they break in to arrest him.
2275700 2279784 And he still can't figure out<br />how on earth they could've caught him!
2288824 2292033 Do I look like I wanna be<br />on the Discovery Channel?
2293241 2295866 -No.<br />-Then get the fuck out of my shop.
2299783 2302198 Oh, yeah, make sure you get that.
2302282 2305407 Without him, things could've gone<br />really fucking wrong tonight.
2306823 2310490 -Fuck! This could be a…<br />-Graham, don't! Don't! Don't you dare.
2311032 2312489 Don't.
2312573 2314031 Graham Waters.
2315822 2319031 No. No, he's not here, Mom.
2319531 2321031 -It's your mother?<br />-Yeah.
2321531 2323656 I'm not gonna go looking for him.
2324572 2327737 Look, he'll be home when he…<br />Just leave it alone, Mom.
2327821 2331571 Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?<br />I'm having sex with a white woman.
2332780 2334363 Okay, where were we?
2335571 2338362 I was white, and you were about<br />to jerk off in the shower.
2338446 2339655 Oh, shit.
2341695 2342904 Come on.
2343195 2344611 I would've said you were Mexican,
2344695 2347295 but I don't think<br />it would've pissed her off as much.
2348029 2351236 Why do you keep everybody<br />at a certain distance, huh?
2351320 2353236 What, you start to feel something<br />and panic?
2353320 2354777 Come on, Ria.
2354861 2357194 You're just pissed<br />'cause I answered the phone.
2358028 2360194 That's just where I begin to get pissed.
2360278 2364194 I mean, really, what kind of man<br />speaks to his mother that way, huh?
2364278 2367903 Oh, this is about my mother.<br />What do you know about my mother?
2368194 2371610 I know if I was your father,<br />I'd kick your fucking ass.
2372277 2374109 Okay. I was raised badly.
2374193 2377776 Why don't you take your clothes off,<br />get back in the bed and teach me a lesson?
2377860 2380109 You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
2380193 2382108 How about a geography lesson?
2382192 2386026 My father's from Puerto Rico.<br />My mother's from El Salvador.
2386442 2388817 Neither one of those is Mexico.
2389359 2391983 Well, then I guess the big mystery is
2392067 2395108 who gathered all those<br />remarkably different cultures together
2395192 2398191 and taught them all<br />how to park their cars on their lawns?
2426523 2427981 Pop, you okay?
2428689 2431148 If I could piss, I'd be okay.
2433231 2435481 I'm… Jesus.
2436148 2437563 I'm done now.
2438897 2440397 Give me a hand.
2443313 2445147 Wait a goddamn minute.
2445313 2447980 -Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2450022 2453229 -All right. Okay. Okay.<br />-Okay. There you go.
2460646 2462812 Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.
2463437 2465311 -I gotta go back.<br />-Okay.
2478519 2481227 What, are you gonna stand there<br />and stare at me?
2550889 2553096 So Conklin just shot him?
2553180 2554930 -They know each other?<br />-Sir.
2555014 2557930 -This a grudge thing?<br />-Not as far as we can tell.
2560013 2561554 You think this is racially motivated?
2561638 2564929 Well, a dozen people heard the shots.<br />Nobody saw anything.
2565013 2567595 -Who do we have on it?<br />-Graham Waters.
2567679 2570887 Waters. All right, well, tell him<br />that he speaks to no one but me.
2570971 2574261 Call a press conference for 4:00,<br />and I want Waters here at 3:30.
2574345 2576295 And would someone please find Flanagan?
2578345 2580137 -Oh, what up, Mo Phat?<br />-What's up?
2581345 2583678 Man robs purses from old ladies<br />and you all,
2583762 2585803 "Hey, how's it going, Mo Phat?"
2585887 2588677 That nigga will steal teeth<br />from a cripple, man.
2589094 2591760 You calling him a thief? And we do what?
2591844 2593718 The man steals from black people.
2593802 2596010 Only reason black people<br />steal from their own
2596094 2597885 is 'cause they terrified of white people.
2597969 2599343 Oh, man, please.
2599427 2602926 Think about it.<br />Sherman Oaks. Burbank. Santa Monica.
2603010 2605467 All scary-ass places<br />for a brother to find himself.
2605551 2608009 Now, drop Mo Phat off<br />at a Starbucks in Toluca Lake,
2608093 2612093 that nigga will run like a rabbit<br />soon as somebody say "decaf latte."
2612843 2615300 What the fuck did you do to my car?
2623675 2625925 Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.
2626509 2629008 I turn key to my car, but nothing.
2630091 2634340 James wanted to take this to school, but<br />I don't want the kids to fight over it.
2634424 2637841 -Are these clean or dirty?<br />-All clean, señora.
2638424 2640674 You know, Maria,<br />just once I would like to wake up
2640758 2643048 and find these dishes in the cabinet.
2644257 2646923 -Okay?<br /><i>-Sí,</i> señora. No problem.
2648673 2650214 I'm starting to understand now.
2650298 2653548 By your work, you're setting an example<br />for our neighborhood.
2653632 2656131 Sort of like a big brother<br />kind of thing, right?
2657006 2658630 Well, yeah, you laugh, man.
2658714 2662797 But you have never seen me steal<br />from a black person ever in your life.
2664714 2666963 What the hell do you think<br />you doing right now, man?
2667047 2668671 Waving down the bus.
2668755 2671296 Man, put your hand down, dawg!<br />Are you out of your mind?
2671380 2673421 You actually expect me to get on a bus?
2673505 2675754 No. I was hoping we could push your car<br />across town.
2675838 2678504 You know why? 'Cause we just<br />don't do stuff like that no more.
2678588 2680587 You have no idea, do you?
2680671 2682795 You have no idea<br />why they put them great big windows
2682879 2684378 on the sides of buses, do you?
2684462 2686961 -Why?<br />-One reason only.
2687045 2690754 To humiliate the people of color<br />who are reduced to riding on them.
2691212 2692628 How do you know that?
2692712 2696044 You know, you could fill the Staples<br />Center with what you don't know.
2696128 2698044 Oh, you know,<br />the Kings are playing tonight.
2698128 2701678 You don't like hockey! The only reason<br />you say you do is to piss me off!
2702211 2703502 I love hockey.
2703586 2705627 Cut! Print. Moving on.
2705711 2709751 Okay, that takes us into scene 12,<br />and we are in the bathroom.
2709835 2713043 Jamal, that's what I'm talking about.
2713127 2714335 Right on.
2716335 2717641 Cam, Cam, you got a second?
2717725 2719876 Yeah, Fred. I just wanna grab some coffee.
2719960 2722627 Yeah, listen,<br />I think we needed another take, buddy.
2723167 2725126 That looked pretty terrific, man.
2725542 2729501 This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal<br />seeing a speech coach or something?
2730001 2731292 What do you mean?
2731667 2733334 Have you noticed…
2733667 2735667 I mean, this is weird<br />for a white guy to say,
2735751 2739333 but have you noticed<br />he's talking a lot less black lately?
2741083 2743582 -No, I haven't noticed that.<br />-Really?
2743666 2747082 Like in this scene, he was supposed<br />to say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."
2747166 2749416 And he changed it to,<br />"Don't talk to me about that."
2749500 2752081 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />You think because of that,
2752165 2755498 the audience won't recognize him<br />as being a black man?
2755582 2758124 -Come on.<br />-Is there a problem, Cam?
2758999 2762040 -Excuse me?<br />-Is there a problem, Cam?
2767623 2769789 No, we don't have a problem.
2770164 2773664 I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,<br />it's not his character.
2773748 2776289 Eddie's supposed to be the smart one,<br />not Jamal, right?
2776373 2779622 I mean, you're the expert here,<br />but to me, it rings false.
2783663 2787413 -We're gonna do it one more time.<br />-Thanks, buddy.
2787497 2790747 Everybody back to one, please.<br />Let's do it one more time.
2794079 2795454 Jamal…
2800329 2802953 -Morning, Carol. Who do I have?<br />-Hold for a minute, please.
2803037 2806786 Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,<br />but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.
2811161 2812536 Send him in.
2814578 2816036 -Mr. Ryan.<br />-Yeah.
2816120 2818244 My name is Shaniqua Johnson.
2818328 2820119 I believe we spoke last night.
2821035 2823660 Oh, yeah.<br />I wanted to apologize about that.
2824160 2827660 I haven't been getting too much sleep.<br />My father's in a lot of pain.
2827744 2829827 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
2829994 2834159 This doctor he's been seeing<br />says he's got a urinary tract infection.
2834243 2836284 But he's been taking this medicine<br />for a month now,
2836368 2837659 and he just keeps getting worse.
2837743 2840576 -And he's been back to see Dr. Robertson?<br />-Yeah.
2841159 2844034 -Between you and me, the man's an idiot.<br />-Really?
2844118 2846658 Well, no offense,<br />but the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
2846742 2848992 I think his nurses<br />are doing most of the work.
2849783 2853950 If you're unhappy, your father's welcome<br />to see a doctor outside the network.
2854867 2858074 And if this new doctor<br />says it's not an infection,
2858158 2861323 says it's his prostate and it needs to be<br />operated on, is that gonna be covered?
2861407 2865032 -Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes…<br />-Then what good is that gonna do?
2865741 2868491 I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
2868782 2871032 All right. Well, you know what I can't do?
2871991 2874531 I can't look at you<br />without thinking about the five or six
2874615 2877156 more-qualified white men<br />who didn't get your job.
2877240 2878572 It's time for you to go.
2878656 2881864 Now, I'm saying this 'cause I'm<br />really hoping that I'm wrong about you.
2881948 2883822 I'm hoping that someone like yourself,
2883906 2885947 someone who may have been given<br />a helping hand,
2886031 2888738 might have a little compassion<br />for someone in a similar situation.
2888822 2890863 Carol, I need security in my office.
2890947 2893780 You know, you don't like me, that's fine.<br />I'm a prick.
2894197 2897071 But my father doesn't deserve<br />to suffer like this.
2897155 2899238 He was a janitor.<br />He struggled his whole life.
2899322 2901195 Saved enough to start his own company.
2901279 2902945 Twenty-three employees, all of them black.
2903029 2905945 Paid them equal wages<br />when no one else was doing that.
2906029 2908320 For 30 years<br />he worked side by side with those men,
2908404 2910779 sweeping and carrying garbage.
2910863 2912445 And then the city council decides
2912529 2916194 to give minority-owned companies<br />preference in city contracts.
2916278 2918737 And overnight, my father loses everything.
2919195 2921778 His business, his home, his wife.<br />Everything.
2922987 2925445 Not once does he blame your people.
2927320 2929402 I'm not asking you to help me.
2929902 2934027 I'm asking that you do this small thing<br />for a man who lost everything
2934319 2936818 so people like yourself<br />could reap the benefits.
2936902 2939986 And do you know<br />what it's gonna cost you? Nothing.
2941152 2943026 Just a flick of your pen.
2944776 2947401 Your father sounds like a good man.
2947485 2951776 And if he'd come in here today,<br />I probably would've approved this request.
2951860 2956566 But he didn't come in. You did.<br />And for his sake, it's a real shame.
2956650 2959150 -Get him the hell out of my office.<br />-Prick.
2966650 2968566 Yeah, sir, I spoke to our employee,
2968650 2971024 and he told you you needed to replace<br />or repair the door.
2971108 2973024 He say he fix the lock.
2973108 2976065 -You come here, see how fixed it is!<br /><i>-You're yelling again.</i>
2976149 2977858 I am not yelling! I'm upset!
2979483 2981774 -Yes, I am.<br />-Mom, are you all right?
2982940 2987148 Stop washing. Insurance must take picture.<br />Okay?
2988273 2990523 -Yes.<br />-Look what they wrote.
2991815 2994231 -They think we're Arab.<br />-Please, you come see my store.
2994315 2995856 When did Persian become Arab?
2995940 2998938 I want… I want his name. Yes.
2999022 3000356 Oh, my God.
3000606 3002355 -I want his name!<br />-Dad.
3002439 3003730 -Give me his name!<br />-Dad.
3003814 3005188 I'm not giving you his name, sir.
3005272 3006563 Dad, did they take the gun?
3006647 3009063 -Not fix my lock! I want his name!<br />-Baba.
3009147 3011354 -I'm gonna hang up now, sir.<br /><i>-Don't hang up!</i>
3011438 3013563 Don't hang up! Shit!
3015230 3016688 Oh, thank God.
3062393 3063727 Mom?
3065517 3067767 Mom, it's cold. Come on.
3090766 3092765 Did you find your brother?
3094724 3095932 No, Mom.
3106473 3108181 I was doing good.
3109848 3113223 I was… I was doing real good.
3115431 3117931 -I know, Mom.<br />-I was doing good.
3122805 3124097 It's okay.
3136137 3138137 Did you find your brother?
3140721 3141971 No, Mom.
3144304 3146511 Tell him to come home.
3148178 3151511 Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
3152720 3154053 Okay, baby?
3154470 3157761 -Okay, Mom.<br />-Okay, baby.
3159053 3160469 Okay.
3161594 3162760 Okay.
3199258 3202007 -Did you apologize to your mother?<br />-She wasn't there.
3204382 3208007 Internal Affairs called.<br />Found something in the Mercedes.
3210382 3212091 That's lunch. One hour.
3241672 3243171 I tried to call.
3243629 3245879 Sounded like you were having<br />a bad day, huh?
3245963 3247004 Yeah.
3251671 3252754 What?
3254546 3256337 I got scared, Cam.
3257295 3261420 You know, it's not like I haven't been<br />pulled over before, you know?
3262295 3263878 But nothing like that.
3265837 3268003 And, yes, I was a little drunk
3268878 3270836 and I was mouthing off.
3271586 3272877 I'm sorry.
3276169 3278252 But when that man<br />was putting his hands on me…
3278336 3279543 I don't wanna talk about it.
3279627 3282461 I couldn't believe<br />you'd let him do that, baby.
3284251 3287876 Look, I know what you did<br />was the right thing. Okay?
3289543 3291335 But I was humiliated.
3292460 3293626 For you.
3294835 3298584 I just couldn't stand to see that man<br />take away your dignity.
3299584 3302167 Yeah. That's what happened.
3302334 3304000 Oh, baby, don't do this.
3304084 3305833 -No. No, you're right.<br />-Come on.
3305917 3307250 I ain't doing it.
3307334 3309375 You gonna walk away from me?
3310708 3312583 -Cameron!<br />-Just go home.
3322291 3323666 I understand.
3324540 3325707 Thanks.
3329540 3332582 -Has your father read his policy?<br />-He doesn't read English.
3336957 3339747 Mr. Golzari,<br />you said that you called the locksmith?
3340872 3342789 Yes. I tell him, fix it.
3343331 3345414 They said that their man told you
3346956 3349206 to fix the door, and you didn't do so.
3351121 3353038 Are you saying it's his fault?
3354538 3357063 Insurance company<br />is calling it negligence.
3357147 3359163 They're not covering any of this.
3367620 3368579 No.
3369495 3371495 This store is all we have.
3388953 3390578 I really am sorry.

3423700 3426408 It's okay. It's okay. Go home and sleep.
3449489 3450614 Hey.
3452323 3455697 Maybe they didn't tell you,<br />but I've been reassigned.
3455781 3457239 Yeah, they told me.
3458239 3462363 I just wanted to say good luck<br />and it was good riding with you.
3462780 3464072 You, too.
3468280 3471113 Wait till you've been on the job<br />a few more years.
3471197 3473155 -Yeah.<br />-Look at me, look at me.
3475279 3478071 Wait till you've been<br />doing it a little longer.
3479237 3481487 You think you know who you are?
3483571 3485154 You have no idea.
3489736 3492736 Yo, Gomez, you ready to roll, homie?

3774424 3776965 Okay. Okay.
3777465 3779506 Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.
3779590 3781798 I'm not gonna touch you.
3781882 3785215 But there's nobody else here yet,<br />and that's gasoline there.
3786715 3790089 We need to get you out of here<br />right away. Okay?
3790423 3793881 -Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br />-Okay.
3794673 3798798 I need to reach across your lap.<br />Can I do that, please?
3801423 3803213 Yeah. Yeah.
3804838 3806005 Thanks.
3811505 3813213 Is anything broken?
3814422 3816129 I don't think so.
3816921 3819212 Okay. I think that's good.
3820421 3823212 -Are you gonna get me out?<br />-Yeah.
3823921 3825753 I'm gonna get you out. Okay?
3825837 3828546 Look at me. Look at me.<br />I'm gonna get you out.
3835378 3836628 Oh, fuck!
3837128 3840128 -I'm sorry.<br />-That's okay.
3842253 3844252 I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?
3844960 3847044 I'm gonna have to cut the belt.
3848294 3849835 It's okay, it's okay.
3849919 3852376 It's okay. It's okay.<br />Okay, we're gonna get you out.
3852460 3854710 Everything's gonna be fine. Look at me.
3854794 3857292 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />We're gonna get you out of here.
3857376 3859209 Everything's gonna be fine.
3878250 3879375 Ryan!
3913580 3914664 Pull!
3930246 3931538 It's okay.
3941203 3943244 It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
3943328 3946911 All right. Here we go.<br />It's okay, it's okay.
3946995 3949620 It's all right. I got it now. I got it.
3950245 3952243 Ma'am? Ma'am, can you walk with me?
3952327 3954619 It's cool, it's cool. It's okay.
3955452 3959286 Here we go. All right, you're doing great.<br />You're doing great.
3989950 3993199 The DA wanted me to apologize.<br />He really wanted to be here himself.
3993283 3994490 No, he didn't.
3994574 3996324 If he did his own dirty work,<br />none of us would have jobs.
3996408 3998740 -Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.<br />-Graham Waters.
3998824 4001324 -Thanks for coming in, Detective.<br />-He just pulled into the garage.
4001408 4004615 Great, great. Press conference is in<br />10 minutes, so we'll make this short.
4004699 4008323 Internal Affairs says this Conklin has<br />two suspicious shootings on his record.
4008407 4011573 Both black men.<br />Both times he was cleared, but only just.
4011657 4014323 Detective Lewis<br />makes black man number three.
4014407 4017307 You know any reason<br />why we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?
4017865 4021656 Well, it's… It's more complicated<br />than we originally thought.
4023531 4027739 We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car<br />that Detective Lewis was driving.
4029281 4030364 Shit!
4032072 4033280 Go down to the garage.
4033364 4035864 Tell him to stay in the car<br />until he hears from me.
4036238 4039654 You found the money in the Mercedes.<br />I thought that wasn't his car.
4039738 4042279 Well, the car's actually registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
4042363 4044237 We haven't been able<br />to get in touch with her, yet.
4044321 4047155 Apparently, she left town this morning.
4047904 4049320 So it wasn't Lewis' car.
4049404 4051704 He may not have even known<br />the money was in it.
4057737 4060820 Do you really think you're gonna be able<br />to make that fly?
4063403 4066319 Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.
4066403 4069069 -These names ring a bell, Detective?<br />-Yeah, vaguely.
4069153 4072694 We have attorneys<br />for this slain police officer
4072778 4074277 camping in our offices.
4074361 4076776 We have his mother<br />and a half a dozen men of the cloth
4076860 4080318 who swear that Lewis<br />was one of the twelve apostles of Christ.
4080402 4083193 We have two black city councilmen<br />and a congresswoman
4083277 4085901 who call on the hour, every hour,<br />demanding to know
4085985 4088150 what the District Attorney<br />intends to do about this.
4088234 4089983 And you want him<br />to walk into that press room
4090067 4093359 and tell them all<br />that the situation is complicated?
4100526 4102066 Give us a minute.
4103358 4104691 No problem.
4113066 4114733 Who knows about the money?
4115233 4116940 You gotta be kidding me.
4117024 4119190 There are only two people in this room.
4121232 4124565 Myself, my partner, Ferguson<br />and Internal Affairs.
4124649 4126357 -Jim Ferguson?<br />-Yeah.
4131564 4133730 Okay. Okay, I guess I don't see a problem.
4133814 4136980 As it wasn't Lewis' car, the money<br />isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing.
4137064 4139814 And even if it was,<br />we aren't going to prosecute a dead man.
4139898 4141814 Which means<br />the money Internal Affairs is holding
4141898 4144021 can't even be considered evidence.
4144105 4146688 What? You know, you can<br />do this whole dance if you want to,
4146772 4148396 but I'm willing to bet
4148480 4150438 when the coroner's report<br />comes back tomorrow
4150522 4153855 it's going to say that Detective Lewis<br />was coked out of his head.
4154772 4156479 Fucking black people, huh?
4157062 4159437 -What did you just say?<br />-I mean…
4160479 4162603 You know, I know<br />all the sociological reasons
4162687 4166103 why per capita eight times more black men<br />are incarcerated than white men.
4166187 4167812 Schools are a disgrace.
4167896 4170186 Lack of opportunity.<br />Bias in the judicial system.
4170270 4172144 All that stuff. All that stuff!
4172228 4176561 But still, it's gotta get to you,<br />on a gut level as a black man.
4176645 4179645 They just can't keep their hands<br />out of the cookie jar.
4185019 4186851 Of course, you and I know<br />that's not the truth,
4186935 4188976 but that's the way it always plays,<br />doesn't it?
4189060 4192810 And assholes like Lewis just keep<br />feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.
4194019 4196351 What did you say you did for the DA again?
4196435 4198392 You coach ball down in Compton.<br />Am I right?
4198476 4200518 Oh, please, don't do that.
4200768 4203225 Don't act like you know<br />something about me, okay?
4203309 4207392 What do you think those kids need?<br />To make them believe, to give them hope?
4207476 4209975 You think they need another<br />drug-dealing cop
4210059 4212683 or do you think they need<br />a fallen black hero?
4212767 4214891 Why don't you cut through<br />the bullshit, Flanagan,
4214975 4217183 and just tell me what it is you want?
4219517 4222850 The DA's squad loses<br />its lead investigator next month.
4223058 4226307 Rick is quite adamant<br />that his replacement be a person of color.
4226391 4228338 It's a high-profile position, and he wants
4228422 4230515 to send the right<br />message to the community.
4230599 4234432 And the right message is,<br />"Look at this black boy I just bought?"
4234516 4238016 Well, fuck you very much,<br />but thanks for thinking of me.
4239473 4241431 Actually, we were thinking of you.
4243056 4244431 Until we saw that.
4246223 4248139 It's your brother's file.
4248223 4250722 Twenty something years old<br />and already three felonies.
4250806 4253638 Three-strikes law. Kid's going<br />away for life for stealing a car.
4253722 4255264 Christ, that's a shitty law.
4256555 4258180 There's a warrant in there.
4258264 4261930 But still, hey,<br />he had every opportunity you had.
4265389 4267388 Fucking black people, huh?
4272471 4273679 So all…
4274721 4278970 All I need to do to make this disappear<br />is to frame a potentially innocent man?
4279054 4281969 What are you?<br />The fucking defender of all things white?
4282053 4285719 We're talking about a white man<br />who shot three black men.
4285803 4289178 And you're arguing with me<br />that maybe we're not being fair to him?
4290512 4292303 You know what? Maybe you're right.<br />Maybe you're right.
4292387 4293510 Maybe Lewis did provoke this
4293594 4295944 and maybe he got exactly<br />what was coming to him.
4296302 4299177 Or maybe, stoned or not,<br />just being a black man in the Valley
4299261 4301261 was enough to get him killed.
4302427 4305343 There was no one there to see who<br />shot first, so there is no way to know.
4305427 4308426 Which means we could get this wrong.
4311260 4314384 Maybe that's what happened<br />with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.
4314468 4317885 Maybe Lewis isn't the only one<br />who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
4319426 4322925 You're the one closest to all this.<br />You need to tell us.
4327050 4329134 What does your gut tell you?
4342716 4345216 So, Graham.
4345591 4347341 What do I tell them?
4347632 4350340 You tell me, and I'll tell them.
4358382 4361589 Well, I think given<br />Detective Conklin's history,
4362589 4364881 it's pretty clear what<br />happened last night.
4366381 4367464 Okay.
4385171 4387254 <i>Before I get to why we're here,</i>
4387338 4391004 <i>I know that many of you have heard<br />that we had our car stolen last night.</i>
4391379 4395795 <i>And as you could imagine,<br />my wife and I are both pretty shaken up.</i>
4395879 4397670 <i>But we're okay.</i>
4397754 4401336 <i>And Jean and I truly appreciate<br />all your calls and your concern.</i>
4401420 4402627 <i>Thank you.</i>
4402711 4406669 <i>Now, just after 9 p.m. last night,</i>
4406836 4409377 <i>Detective William Lewis,<br />an eight-year veteran of the force</i>
4409461 4411252 <i>and an active member<br />of the black community,</i>
4411336 4413211 <i>was gunned down by a fellow officer.</i>
4429168 4430542 Hi, sweetie.

4583906 4586323 Oh, you so brave, you<br />get out the car, man.
4589031 4592240 Turn off the engine.<br />Throw the keys out the window.
4605530 4608279 You fucking want me?<br />Here I am, you pig fuck!
4608363 4610445 Lie face down on the ground.<br />Spread your arms and legs.
4610529 4612945 No, you lie face down on the ground<br />and spread your arms and legs.
4613029 4614737 Don't come any closer! Down on your knees!
4614821 4616279 Fuck you, man! What are you gonna do?
4616363 4618529 -Pull the fucking trigger, then!<br />-On your knees now!
4618613 4619654 You get on your knees
4619738 4621819 and suck my motherfucking dick<br />while you down there.
4621903 4623778 Do I look like I'm<br />fucking joking with you?
4623862 4625944 Yeah, that's what you look like,<br />a fucking joke to me.
4626028 4628361 -This man is making threatening gestures.<br />-Threatening gestures?
4628445 4631403 You wanna see a threatening gesture?<br />I got a threatening gesture for you.
4631487 4634318 -I know this man! I know this man!<br />-Get back.
4634402 4636068 Fuck off. Give me some space.<br />I know this guy.
4636152 4637693 -Get out of the way.<br />-You don't fucking know me.
4637777 4638902 Step away.
4638986 4641152 Give me some goddamn room.<br />I know this guy.
4642444 4644985 -Man, don't walk up on me!<br />-See what's happening here?
4645069 4647443 Do you wanna die here, huh?<br />Is that what you want?
4647527 4649442 'Cause these guys really wanna shoot you.
4649526 4652317 And the way you're acting,<br />they'll be completely fucking justified.
4652401 4654151 -Fuck you!<br />-Fuck me? Fuck me?
4654235 4656526 I'm not the one who's fucked here.<br />You're the one who's fucked here.
4656610 4658276 'Cause you're the one whose head's<br />gonna be blown off
4658360 4659651 and onto that man's patio.
4659735 4662150 -Officer Hanson, step away.<br />-He's a friend of mine, okay?
4662234 4664816 He's a fucking friend of mine!<br />This man is not armed!
4664900 4667566 He's not gonna shoot you, or me,<br />or anybody else, all right?
4667650 4670108 So give me two goddamn seconds.<br />Can you do that?
4670192 4672817 Lower your firearm! Lower your firearm!
4678191 4680524 Are you starting<br />to understand the situation?
4681524 4683274 What do you want from me?
4684566 4686107 Unless you think your wife
4686191 4689106 is gonna be better off with a husband<br />who has a bloody stump for a head,
4689190 4691356 I want you to sit down on that curb,<br />put your hands on your head,
4691440 4693356 and do nothing<br />until I speak with these officers.
4693440 4696856 I'm not sitting on no curb. I'm not<br />putting my hands on my head for nobody.
4696940 4698314 Then stand right where you are
4698398 4701315 and keep your hands in plain sight.<br />Can you do that, huh?
4703981 4705814 Yeah, I can do that.
4706106 4707189 Good.
4708439 4711889 I told this man to stay where he is<br />and keep his hands in plain sight.
4712231 4716646 This man better be related to you by blood<br />because this is fucking nuts.
4717021 4718646 I need this favor.
4718855 4722730 You can check the guy's name, his license.<br />He's got no priors, no warrants.
4723063 4725021 I need to let him go with a warning.
4726146 4730062 -What kind of fucking warning?<br />-A harsh warning.
4733520 4734979 Thank you.
4738270 4740320 You've been warned. Do you understand me?
4741020 4742561 Do you understand me?
4742645 4745519 You want something from me?<br />'Cause I'm right here.
4746228 4750019 -Look, I'm trying to help you.<br />-I didn't ask for your help, did I?
4752019 4753228 Go home.
4757810 4759518 Yeah, that I can do.
4838971 4840304 Look at me.
4842012 4843596 You embarrass me.
4844971 4846804 You embarrass yourself.
4889843 4891259 Daddy's home!
4911507 4913048 -What's up?<br />-Give me my money!
4913132 4915298 -What? What money?<br />-Daddy!
4915382 4918965 -To pay for my store. Give me my money!<br />-Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!
4919049 4920549 -You give me my money.<br />-Daddy.
4921673 4923797 I want my fucking money!<br />Give me that truck.
4923881 4925297 That's not my truck, bro.
4925381 4927089 -Daddy?<br />-Elizabeth!
4927173 4928422 Hey, hey, hey. You okay?
4928506 4931589 You know what? Hey, I got $50. Here, here.
4931673 4933839 $50? You took everything!
4933923 4935047 Mommy?
4936630 4938546 I'm coming, I'm coming.
4938630 4942422 -He doesn't have it.<br />-Hasn't got what?
4942839 4946005 I have it. He doesn't have<br />the impenetrable cloak.
4948089 4949754 Lara, stay out of the street!
4976961 4978586 It's okay, Daddy.
4980002 4982586 -What? What?<br />-I'll protect you.
5009250 5011125 It's okay. Daddy's okay.
5013542 5015959 -It's a really good cloak.<br />-Good.
5096369 5097869 How's it going?
5123951 5127616 I sent her out for groceries,<br />and that was two hours ago, Carol.
5129033 5131199 Well, you know what? You are one to talk.
5131283 5133950 You go through, like,<br />six housekeepers a year.
5135241 5138241 I'm not snapping at you. I am angry.
5139657 5141781 Yes. At them! Yes!
5141865 5146240 At them, the police, at Rick, at Maria,
5146324 5150073 at the dry cleaners<br />who destroyed another blouse today,
5150157 5153947 at the gardener<br />who keeps over-watering the lawn.
5154031 5155073 I…
5156489 5158114 I just thought that…
5159156 5162198 Carol, I just thought that<br />I would wake up today
5162823 5165281 and I would feel better, you know?
5165864 5168863 But I was still mad. And I realized…
5169947 5173738 I realized that it had nothing to do<br />with my car being stolen.
5175905 5178280 I wake up like this every morning.
5179822 5183570 I am angry all the time,<br />and I don't know why.
5183654 5186029 Carol, I don't know why. And I…
5188737 5190737 Yeah, yeah, call me back.
5191987 5193071 Bye.
5304687 5306437 I really appreciate this.
5307270 5308603 No problem.
5314728 5317435 So how long you been out there tonight?<br />It's cold.
5317519 5318894 Hour, maybe.
5319686 5321310 Big surprise, huh?
5321394 5324311 Yeah, this ain't exactly<br />pick-up-a-brother territory.
5324894 5325936 True.
5327436 5330976 -So where you headed?<br />-Anywhere the other side of the hill.
5331685 5333309 I'm going to El Segundo.
5333393 5334810 El Segundo's cool.
5335643 5338268 -You've been there?<br />-Fuck, no.
5345225 5346767 That's some good music.
5349975 5352392 No, really. I'm starting to understand it.
5353642 5356600 Wrote me a country song myself<br />just yesterday.
5356684 5358641 I'll bet you did.
5359891 5361141 Whatever.
5376057 5378556 So what was going on<br />in the Valley tonight?
5378640 5380057 Ice-skating.
5381307 5382806 Ice-skating.
5382890 5384640 Love the ice-skating, man.
5385097 5388431 You know, when I was a kid,<br />I always wanted to be a goalie.
5389389 5390681 Come on.
5391472 5394222 What, you think that's funny or something?
5394306 5396388 I think you're having fun.
5396472 5397972 Yeah. Whatever.
5408138 5410930 -Something else funny?<br />-Oh, yeah.
5413262 5414929 Yeah? What's that?
5415637 5417429 People, man. People.
5418845 5420512 People like me.
5421804 5424095 No, no, no. I'm not laughing at you, man.
5425470 5428385 Yeah, I can see that.<br />Why don't you laugh outside?
5428469 5430594 Dawg, why are you getting<br />all bent out of shape?
5430678 5433344 I'm not getting bent, man.<br />I'm just pulling over.
5436303 5439593 Come on, man, keep driving.<br />I said I'm not laughing at you.
5439677 5442384 And I'm not telling you<br />to get the fuck out of my car.
5442468 5444718 Why you being a fucking jerk, man?<br />Just drive the car.
5444802 5446676 I've got a better idea. Get out now.
5446760 5448551 Fine. You want me to show you?<br />I'll show you.
5448635 5451009 Get your hands out of your pocket.<br />Put your hands where I can see them.
5451093 5452259 Who the fuck you think you're talking to?
5452343 5453467 Put your hands where I can see them.
5453551 5457251 You wanna see what's in my hands?<br />I'll show you what's in my fucking hands.
5481632 5482924 Oh, God.
5492382 5493590 Oh, God.
5529337 5531087 <i>Thank you, brother Merle, for that.</i>
5531171 5535711 <i>That was Merle Haggard here on KYHA,<br />the scene of country music here in LA.</i>
5536003 5538461 <i>It's a cold night, and<br />it's getting colder.</i>
5538545 5541711 <i>And we're giving out tickets to the rodeo<br />coming to the Fairplex in Pomona,</i>
5541795 5542920 <i>so give us a call…</i>
5546295 5549919 -Hey, you okay?<br />-I'm freezing.
5550335 5553126 Shit. I heard it might snow.
5553210 5555710 -Get out of here.<br />-That's what I heard.
5555794 5558252 -You got a smoke?<br />-No. I quit.
5558960 5560460 Yeah, me, too.
5561752 5563876 -What do you got?<br />-Dead kid.
5566793 5568251 Hey, Bob.
5656745 5659868 Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
5659952 5662702 -Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!<br />-Do you speak English?
5662786 5666911 I am speaking English, you stupid cow!<br />My husband name Choi Jin Gui!
5668744 5670327 -Jin Gui!<br />-Ma'am!
5671618 5672785 Kim Lee.
5679535 5683285 I thought you were dead.<br />I called every hospital.
5683785 5685742 It's okay. I'm okay.
5686200 5689700 I went crazy speeding. I drove into a car.
5689950 5692075 Oh, my God. Are you okay?
5692159 5695617 Got into big fight with poor woman.<br />I called her names.
5697575 5700741 Oh, fine. I die from worry and you laugh.
5704616 5706574 Thank you for finding me.
5709658 5713239 -Will you do something for me?<br />-Anything.
5713323 5714907 Go to the locker.
5719240 5720740 No, next one.
5723865 5726406 In my wallet there's a check.
5726947 5728156 Bring it here.
5737572 5740696 Oh, I get it. When I said<br />get me a black Lincoln Navigator,
5740780 5743904 you thought I said<br />get me a white piece-of-shit panel van.
5743988 5747321 Fine, it's fine.<br />Just give me whatever for it, man.
5747821 5749571 You should see this.
5765737 5767361 I'll take the van.
5768111 5769777 They're chained to the van.
5769861 5771403 So I'll take them, too.
5772861 5774444 You wanna buy these Chinamen?
5774528 5776860 Don't be ignorant.<br />They're Thai or Cambodian.
5776944 5779027 Entirely different kind of chinks.
5779111 5782484 -What the hell are you gonna do with them?<br />-Sell them. What the hell do you think?
5782568 5786110 I'll give you $500 apiece,<br />and you can keep the van.
5805317 5807276 Oh, no!
5811441 5813400 No! No!
5830399 5831690 This is Dorri.
5844606 5847523 My baby. My poor baby.
5850605 5851730 Mom.
5853313 5857980 I promise you. I promise<br />I'm gonna find out who did this, Mom.
5859813 5862188 Oh, I already know.
5865312 5866521 You did.
5868604 5872021 I asked you to find your brother,<br />but you were busy.
5873437 5876353 We weren't much good to you anymore,<br />were we?
5881561 5884977 You got things to do.<br />You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.
5885061 5889520 Mom, I wanna stay with…<br />I just wanna wait with my baby.
5901185 5903768 He came home. Did you know that?
5905476 5907226 My little boy.
5908101 5911559 When I was sleeping,<br />he brought me groceries.
5912768 5914726 It's the last thing he did.
5940349 5941432 Baba.
5954390 5955848 What happened?
5962889 5964430 What did you do?
5965930 5967555 Baba, what did you do?
5971180 5973013 I shoot a little girl.
5973513 5974554 What?
5974888 5977429 No, she's okay. She's…
5979513 5981554 She's… Here.
5982013 5983804 The gun shoot her,
5985553 5988053 but she's okay, Dorri. Nothing happened.
5991762 5993053 She's my <i>farishte.</i>
5994928 5997845 -What are you talking about, Daddy?<br />-My <i>farishte,</i> Dorri.
6000177 6001386 My angel.
6004261 6005511 My angel.
6007886 6009719 She came to protect me.
6011844 6013301 To protect us.
6015843 6017260 You understand?
6022593 6024218 Take this. Please.
6025801 6027009 Take it.
6031967 6033300 Hey, hey.
6034842 6036842 Everything is okay, Dorri.
6038425 6039717 It's okay.
6045049 6047383 -Okay, Daddy.<br />-Okay.
6071756 6073005 Jean?
6073089 6075214 <i>-Rick?</i><br />-Yeah. What's wrong?
6075881 6077547 I fell down the stairs.
6078089 6081006 -Are you all right?<br /><i>-I tried calling you.</i>
6081671 6083921 I couldn't get through to anyone. Not…
6084505 6087587 Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie, not…
6087671 6090671 <i>I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in<br />my car. I'll be home in 20 minutes.</i>
6090755 6094046 It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.<br />It's just a bad sprain.
6094505 6096961 <i>Carol was the only one that was home</i>
6097045 6100461 and she said she couldn't come get me<br />because she was getting a massage.
6100545 6102670 Well, that's because she's a bitch.
6103212 6105295 She's been my friend for 10 years.
6106587 6108461 <i>All right, honey. Feel better.</i>
6109294 6110961 I'll be there soon.
6113753 6115044 I love you.
6115919 6117461 I love you, too.
6150416 6151708 Miss Jean.
6153916 6155875 Would you like to sit up?
6161958 6162999 Here.
6163749 6164832 Good.
6174165 6177623 -Do you want to hear something funny?<br />-What, Mrs. Jean?
6180039 6182331 You're the best friend I've got.
6375609 6376609 Hi.
6377900 6378859 Hi.

6536097 6538347 Buy everybody chop suey. You understand?
6541055 6542930 Dopey fucking Chinaman.
6578969 6581844 Oh, my God!<br />What the hell is wrong with you people?
6584219 6586843 Don't talk to me,<br />unless you speak American!
