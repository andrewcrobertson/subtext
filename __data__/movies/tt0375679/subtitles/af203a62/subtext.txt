168262 170306 It's the sense of touch.
171891 173142 What?
175353 179149 Any real city, you walk, you know?
179232 182986 You brush past people.<br />People bump into you.
183195 186156 In L.A., nobody touches you.
188909 192163 We're always behind<br />this metal and glass.
193664 196542 I think we miss<br />that touch so much
196667 200630 that we crash into each other<br />just so we can feel something.
202673 204843 You guys okay?
204968 207012 I think he hit his head.
207930 209890 You don't think that's true?
210057 211934 Stay in your car.
212059 214853 Graham, I think<br />we got rear-ended.
214937 217022 I think we spun around twice.
217106 222070 And somewhere in there,<br />one of us lost our frame of reference.
222195 224572 And I'm gonna go look for it.
226616 229410 - Calm down, ma'am.<br />- I am calm!
229536 231621 I need to see your registration<br />and insurance.
231747 234667 Why? It's not my fault!<br />It's her fault! She do this!
234792 235543 My fault?
235709 237545 Ma'am, you really need<br />to wait in your vehicle.
237670 238587 My fault?
238712 241173 Stop in middle of street!<br />Mexicans no know how to drive.
241298 243259 She "blake" too fast.
243384 246054 I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.
246179 249224 - I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.<br />- Ma'am.
249349 252769 See, I stop when I see a long line of cars<br />stopped in front of me.
252894 255856 Maybe you see over<br />steering wheel, you "blake" too!
255939 256940 Ma'am!
257065 259317 I call immigration on you.<br />Look what you do my car.
259443 263156 Officer, can you please write in your report how<br />shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!
263281 266367 - Ma'am!<br />- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...
271414 274793 All right. You've got to calm down.
282426 284678 Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.
284803 286513 Fuck you.
289642 291561 Hey, you okay?
292729 293938 I'm freezin'.
294022 296775 Shit. I heard it might snow.
296900 299194 - Get outta here.<br />- That's what I heard.
299319 301988 - You got a smoke?<br />- Nah. I quit.
302155 304784 Yeah, me too.
304950 307411 - What do you got?<br />- Dead kid.
317714 318965 Hey, Bob.
361052 363888 You get one free box of ammunition.<br />What kind do you want?
376777 379780 Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad<br />on your own time.
379905 382491 What do you want?
385244 386746 Are you making insult at me?
386830 389749 Am I making insult "at" you?<br />Is that the closest you can come to English?
389833 392752 - Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.<br />- Oh, God, here we go.
392878 395213 I have right like you.<br />I have right to buy gun.
395338 397466 Not in my store, you don't!<br />Andy, get him outta here now!
397591 399718 - Go wait in the car.<br />- Now. Get out!
401137 402722 You're an ignorant man!
402889 404474 Yeah, I'm ignorant?<br />You're liberating my country.
404599 407643 And I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts<br />and incinerating your friends?
407768 410771 - Get the fuck out!<br />- No, you get the fuck out!
410938 412565 No, don't touch me!<br />He cheat me!
412648 414567 - Andy, now!<br />- Let's go.
414650 416111 Okay.
419740 422534 You can give me the gun<br />or give me back the money.
422618 426705 And I am really hoping<br />for the money.
430502 433087 - What kind of ammunition do you want?<br />- Whatever fits.
433171 435173 We got a lot of kinds.
435298 437675 We got long colts,<br />short colts, bull heads,
437801 440303 flat nose, hollow points,<br />wide cutters,
440470 443891 and a dozen more that'll fit<br />any size hole.
443974 447770 Just depends upon how<br />much bang you can handle.
449688 452066 I'll take the ones<br />in the red box.
455319 457739 - You know what those are?<br />- Can I have them?
467874 472046 Did you see any white people waitin' an hour<br />and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?
472171 473631 And how many cups of coffee<br />did we get?
473714 476676 You don't drink coffee<br />and I didn't want any.
476759 480471 Man, that woman poured cup after cup<br />to every single white person around us.
480555 483641 But did she even ask you<br />if you wanted any?
483724 485686 We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want<br />and I didn't order,
485811 488021 and that's evidence<br />of racial discrimination?
488147 490149 Did you notice<br />that our waitress was black?
490232 492693 And black women don't think<br />in stereotypes?
492818 495237 You tell me.<br />When was the last time you met one
495362 497614 who didn't think she knew<br />everything about your lazy ass
497698 499576 before you even opened<br />your mouth, huh?
499701 501953 That waitress sized us up<br />in two seconds.
502078 505832 We're black, and black people don't tip.<br />She wasn't gonna waste her time.
505957 508918 Somebody like that? Nothing you can do<br />to change their mind.
509043 511504 How much did you leave?
511588 513506 You expect me to pay<br />for that kind of service?
514467 518012 What? What the fuck<br />is you laughin' at, man?
518095 521140 I'm seriously starting to think<br />that you're jealous of Karen.
521223 525436 Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through<br />a meal without calling her or anyone else.
525561 530066 Okay, no more phone calls.<br />As a matter of fact, you can hold the battery.
530192 532027 Okay?
533487 535822 Ten bucks says<br />she calls you in the car.
535947 538617 Wait, wait, wait.<br />See what that woman just did?
538742 540702 - You see that?<br />- She's cold.
540827 544165 She got colder<br />as soon as she saw us.
544248 547376 - Ah, come on, don't start.<br />- Man, look around you, man.
547502 550963 You couldn't find a whiter, safer<br />or better-lit part of this city right now.
551088 552965 But yet this white woman<br />sees two black guys
553090 555760 who look like UCLA students<br />strolling down the sidewalk,
555886 558305 and her reaction<br />is blind fear?
558430 560891 Look at us, dawg.<br />Are we dressed like gangbangers?
561016 564353 Huh? No.<br />Do we look threatening? No.
564436 568357 Fact. If anybody should be<br />scared around here, it's us!
568482 572445 We're the only two black faces surrounded by<br />a sea of over-caffeinated white people
572570 575240 patrolled by<br />the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.
575365 578910 So you tell me.<br />Why aren't we scared?
579035 581246 'Cause we got guns?
581329 583248 You could be right.
586210 588420 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- Gimme the keys!
588546 591257 - Hurry up! Get down!<br />- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
591382 595594 - No, no! Please!<br />- Don't look at me! Turn around!
595719 599266 - Come on! Go!<br />- We're fine! Just keep moving!
604479 608900 No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing<br />off of there right now.
609025 611319 I know you just didn't call<br />Saint Christopher voodoo.
611444 613281 Man's the patron saint<br />of travelers, dawg.
613406 616284 You had a conversation<br />with God, huh? What did God say?
616367 620872 "Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery<br />suction rings on every dashboard you find"?
620997 622081 Why the hell do you do that?
622165 625042 Look at the way your crazy ass drive,<br />then ask me again.
632801 635304 Chevy pickup and Mercedes<br />driving north on Balboa.
635471 638140 Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes<br />gets pissed, pulls a gun.
638265 640935 Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup<br />is a cop coming off shift.
641060 642937 This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
643021 645482 Yeah. Name's Conklin.<br />He's a narc out of Wilshire.
645565 647442 I got the Mercedes.
648359 651988 Mercedes takes a shot at him.<br />Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.
652071 655659 Mercedes rolls to a stop. Driver opens the<br />door, falls out dead.
655743 658537 He looks very relaxed<br />for just having shot somebody.
658662 660456 He says he kept tryin'<br />to drive away.
660539 662625 The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,<br />screaming, waving a gun.
662708 665336 Shot back in self-defense.
665419 669633 - Anybody actually see who shot first?<br />- They just heard two bangs.
669758 671593 Find me a witness.
685775 688528 That is a nice gun.
688653 693199 The car's registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
693324 695201 And that's not Cindy.
695284 698080 That is a William Lewis.
698205 701166 Found under the front seat.<br />Hollywood Division.
705671 709591 Looks like Detective Conklin<br />shot himself the wrong nigger.
721146 724274 - How much longer are you gonna be?<br />- This is the last one.
724399 725359 Thank you.
735077 737454 You don't think reporters listen to police calls?
737538 739332 I need to talk to you<br />for a second.
741209 743670 You just give me a minute,<br />all right?
743795 746631 - Find Flanagan, will you? Now.<br />- Yes, sir.
748467 749468 Yes, honey?
749593 751428 I want the locks changed again in the morning.
751511 755266 You want... Why don't you just go lie down?<br />Have you checked on James?
755349 758311 Of course. I've checked on him every five<br />minutes since we've been home.
758394 762607 Do not patronize me. I want the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
763441 766027 It's okay.<br />Just go to bed.
766152 769615 You know, didn't I just ask you<br />not to treat me like a child?
769781 773827 I'm sorry, Miss Jean.<br />Is okay I go home now?
773994 775454 It's fine. Thank you<br />very much for staying.
775621 777247 You're welcome. No problem.<br />Good night.
777331 780125 - Good night.<br />- We'll see you tomorrow.
780209 784297 I would like the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
784422 786758 And you might mention<br />that we'd appreciate it
786841 789052 if next time they didn't send<br />a gang member.
789177 791471 - A gang member? You mean that kid in there?<br />- Yes, yes.
791554 795266 Yes. The guy with the shaved head,<br />the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.
795350 796602 - Those are not prison tattoos.<br />- Oh, really?
796685 798979 And he's not gonna sell our key<br />to one of his gangbanger friends
799104 801482 - the moment he is out our door?<br />- We've had a tough night.
801607 805277 - It'd be best if you went upstairs...<br />- And wait for them to break in?
805402 808864 I just had a gun pointed in my face.
808989 809950 You lower your voice!
810075 812953 And it was my fault<br />because I knew it was gonna happen.
813036 815539 But if a white person sees two black men<br />walking towards her,
815664 819209 and she turns and walks in the other direction,<br />she's a racist, right?
819334 821920 Well, I got scared<br />and I didn't say anything.
822045 824298 And ten seconds later<br />I had a gun in my face!
824382 828594 I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna<br />sell our key to one of his homies.
828719 833182 And this time it'd be really fucking great<br />if you acted like you actually gave a shit!
861129 863339 All right, what have we got?<br />Talk to me, Karen.
863423 865383 Flanagan doesn't think<br />anybody has the story yet.
865466 867887 I'm the goddamn<br />District Attorney of Los Angeles.
868012 871182 If my car gets jacked,<br />it's gonna make news.
871307 873100 Fuck!
874310 876562 Why did these guys<br />have to be black?
876687 878355 I mean, why?
878439 880108 No matter how we spin this,
880233 883278 I'm either gonna lose the black vote<br />or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
883403 886948 You're worrying too much. You have<br />a lot of support in the black community.
888658 891203 All right. If we can't duck this thing,<br />we're gonna have to neutralize it.
891286 895875 What we need is a picture of me<br />pinning a medal on a black man.
895958 897793 Bruce?
899086 900713 The firefighter.
900838 903799 The one who saved the camp or something.<br />Northridge. What's his name?
903883 905009 He's Iraqi.
906010 909223 He's Iraqi?<br />Well, he looks black.
909306 913101 He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.<br />His name's Saddam Khahum.
913227 916230 Saddam?<br />His-His name's Saddam?
916313 920442 That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal<br />on an Iraqi named Saddam.
920526 922737 Give yourself a raise, will you?
925740 928451 It's been good<br />doing business with you.
929327 932705 - How soon can I have them?<br />- I'm picking them up right now.
932831 936460 Look, you're not listening to me.<br />This is an emergency.
936585 939463 I keep telling you he's in pain.<br />He can't sleep.
939547 943467 Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic<br />three times in the last month.
943551 948848 He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.<br />That is by no means an emergency.
948973 953103 If you have any more questions<br />about your HMO plan, why don't you
953186 956773 make an appointment to come in between<br />10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.
956857 958942 What does my father do<br />about sleeping tonight?
959025 960819 I don't know.<br />I'm not a doctor.
960902 963738 - I wanna talk to your supervisor.<br />- I am my supervisor!
963864 965741 - What is your name?<br />- Shaniqua Johnson.
965867 968536 Shaniqua.<br />Big fucking surprise that is.
984887 987222 <i>Bronson Avenue, Westwood.</i>
987347 990017 <i>Vehicle is described as a black<br />late-model Lincoln Navigator.</i>
990142 994689 <i>California plate<br />4 Peter Charles Ida 315.</i>
994772 998234 <i>Suspects are two black males,<br />approximately 20 years of age.</i>
1006618 1007661 That's not it.
1008913 1010831 That's not the vehicle, John.<br />The plates don't match.
1010915 1014668 The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car<br />and takes it to Studio City.
1019757 1022052 They were doin' something.
1066349 1067767 Enthusiastic.
1068977 1071104 Keep your hands<br />where I can see 'em, please.
1071271 1075483 I'm gonna need to see<br />your driver's license and registration.
1075608 1077778 No problem.
1077862 1081740 I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove<br />compartment to get the registration.
1081824 1084201 - Is that okay?<br />- Nice and slow, please.
1084326 1085661 Okay.
1089832 1092002 How are you tonight, Officer?
1092127 1094004 Excellent.
1095839 1097549 Here you go.
1100844 1102929 Stay inside the vehicle, please.
1112356 1114400 Let's do it again right now.
1115234 1117278 Step outta the car, please, sir.
1117361 1121074 Wait a minute, Officer.<br />I haven't been drinking or anything.
1121200 1123410 Then we shouldn't have a problem.
1123535 1126121 He doesn't drink.<br />He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.
1126205 1128123 No, it's okay.
1128207 1129708 It's fine.
1134797 1136799 Step onto the sidewalk, sir.
1138384 1140595 That's good. Right there.
1142347 1143848 Look at me.
1144766 1146726 I want you to stand<br />on your right foot.
1146809 1150981 Touch your nose<br />with the index finger of your left hand.
1155361 1157363 I told you he doesn't drink.
1157488 1160699 Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you<br />one time to stay in the vehicle.
1160783 1163370 - Ma'am?<br />- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.
1163495 1166873 Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell<br />do you think you're talking to?
1166957 1170168 Look, Officer, my wife<br />has had a couple of drinks...
1170293 1173255 Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on<br />top of your head and interlock your fingers.
1173380 1175173 Wait. We're only a block away from our house.
1175257 1177677 Hands on your head.<br />Interlock your fingers.
1177760 1180847 - Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.<br />- I'm a television director.
1180930 1183724 Me and my wife were just coming home<br />from an awards show.
1183808 1186143 Take your hands off him.<br />He's done nothing wrong.
1186269 1188354 Put your hands on top<br />of your head, ma'am.
1188437 1189939 - Do what he says.<br />- Fuck you!
1190064 1191024 Put your hands...
1191108 1193902 And you keep<br />your filthy fucking hands off me!
1194027 1195654 You motherfucking pig!
1195779 1199283 - Just stop talking!<br />- That's quite a mouth you have.
1199408 1201118 Of course you know that.
1201285 1205081 Fuck you! That's what<br />this is all about, isn't it?
1205165 1207959 You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a<br />black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.
1208084 1209794 Will you just shut<br />your fucking mouth!
1209919 1212964 I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.
1213089 1215383 Put your legs open.
1217135 1221599 Do you have any guns or knives<br />or anything I might get stuck with?
1221724 1224226 I'm wearing a cocktail dress.<br />What do you think?
1224310 1226437 You'd be surprised some of the places<br />I've found weapons.
1226562 1227438 He's clean.
1228981 1232861 What do you think we should do about this,<br />Mr. Thayer?
1233737 1237073 My partner and I just witnessed your wife<br />performing fellatio on you
1237199 1239326 while you were operating<br />a motor vehicle.
1239492 1243580 That's reckless endangerment,<br />which incidentally is a felony.
1245582 1250171 We could charge your wife with lewd conduct<br />and performing a sexual act in public.
1252423 1255134 You say you're a block from home.
1255259 1257637 We could use our discretion
1257720 1259764 and let you go with a warning,
1260682 1263143 or we could cuff you and put you<br />in the back of the car.
1265896 1268857 What do you think<br />we should do, sir?
1276366 1279577 Look, we're sorry, and
1279702 1285208 we would appreciate if you would just<br />let us go with a warning, please.
1289839 1292508 The man's apologizing, Tommy.
1292633 1295719 I think we can let him go.<br />Don't you?
1298430 1300015 Yeah.
1300099 1302351 All right.
1303562 1305021 You can go.
1314573 1316867 You folks<br />drive safe now, huh?
1351112 1353448 Let's go, Tommy.
1361624 1363500 It won't close.
1364835 1365794 I can do that.
1365920 1367796 Dad, you couldn't even get it open.
1367922 1369882 Have respect for your father.<br />Give me the gun!
1371717 1374346 Here. Now you can shoot<br />anybody you want.
1374471 1377265 Dorri, that man<br />could've killed your mother.
1377349 1380727 You think I should let crazy people<br />do what they want to us?
1380810 1382312 Farhad, it won't close.
1386942 1389362 Dorri, you should be at work.
1400915 1402918 Who are you calling?
1403043 1405629 I'm gonna report their asses.<br />Sons of bitches.
1405796 1409758 You actually believe they're gonna take<br />anything you have to say seriously?
1409883 1414221 Do you have any idea how that felt?<br />To have that pig's hands all over me?
1414346 1416140 And you just stood there!
1418184 1419978 And then you apologized to him?
1420061 1422981 What did you want me to do?<br />Get us both shot?
1423064 1426526 They were gonna shoot us<br />on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.
1426609 1430364 Well, maybe you would've been satisfied<br />with just being arrested.
1430489 1434326 Oh, I get it. Much better to let him<br />shove his hand up my crotch
1434493 1437246 than get your name in the paper.
1437371 1439498 You finally got me<br />figured out, 'cause see,
1439623 1442376 that's exactly<br />what I was worried about right there.
1442501 1445547 Oh? You weren't afraid that<br />all your good friends at the studio
1445672 1449509 were gonna read about you in the morning<br />and realize he's actually black?
1451178 1453180 You need to calm down right now.
1453305 1458144 What I need is a husband who will not just<br />stand there while I am being molested!
1458227 1461230 They were cops for God sakes!<br />They had guns!
1462899 1465610 Maybe I should've let them<br />arrest your ass.
1465735 1469447 Sooner or later you gotta find out<br />what it is really like to be black.
1470489 1472367 Fuck you, man.<br />Like you know.
1472451 1476163 <i>The closest you ever came to being black,<br />Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.</i>
1476246 1479374 At least I wasn't watching it<br />with the rest of the equestrian team.
1479458 1481627 You're right, Cameron.<br />I got a lot to learn
1481752 1484838 'cause I haven't quite learned<br />how to shuck and jive.
1484922 1487800 Let me hear it again.<br />Thank you, mister policeman.
1487926 1490637 You sure is mighty kind<br />to us poor black folk.
1490762 1495266 You be sure to let me know next time<br />you wanna finger-fuck my wife.
1496809 1499729 How the fuck do you say<br />something like that to me?
1500856 1502066 You know, fuck you!
1504193 1507780 That's good. A little anger.<br />It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!
1557667 1558710 How's it goin'?
1558835 1560461 Okay.
1560587 1562714 You didn't get scared<br />or something, did you?
1562839 1565592 There's no monsters in the closet, right?<br />'Cause I hate monsters.
1565675 1568678 There's no such thing<br />as monsters.
1568803 1570764 Ah, that's a good thing.
1570931 1572391 I heard a bang.
1572516 1574101 Like a truck bang?
1574226 1576312 Like a gun.
1583569 1587407 That's funny, 'cause we moved<br />outta that bad neighborhood.
1587532 1590327 And there's not<br />too many guns around here.
1591703 1594080 How far can bullets go?
1594206 1596166 They go pretty far.
1596249 1599045 But they usually get stuck<br />in something and stop.
1599170 1600838 What if they don't?
1600922 1604675 You thinking about that bullet<br />that came through your window?
1607386 1609472 You think we should move again?
1609597 1611015 I like it here.
1611098 1613101 Me too. But if that bullet<br />found out where we lived...
1614728 1615729 Oh, hold on.
1615854 1617314 What?
1617439 1619483 So stupid!<br />How can I forget this?
1620901 1621860 What?
1624071 1625697 Nah. Forget it.<br />You ain't gonna believe me.
1625822 1627367 Tell me.
1628243 1630703 Okay.
1630787 1634457 When I was five, this fairy<br />came into my room one night.
1634582 1637210 - Right.<br />- See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me.
1637335 1639754 - Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.<br />- No, tell me.
1641924 1644176 Okay.
1644260 1649557 So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,<br />"Yeah, right, you're a fairy. "
1649640 1651684 Anyway, we're talking, you know.
1651767 1654895 And she's flying all around the room,<br />knocking down all my posters and stuff.
1654979 1657357 She was flying?
1657440 1660068 She had these little stubby wings.<br />She could've glued 'em on, you know?
1660193 1662821 Like I'm gonna believe<br />she's a fairy.
1662946 1664906 So she said, "I'll prove it. "
1664990 1667576 So she reaches<br />into her backpack.
1667701 1669954 And she pulls out<br />this invisible cloak.
1670121 1674667 She ties it around my neck, and she tells me<br />that it's impenetrable.
1674792 1677044 You know what<br />impenetrable means?
1677128 1679005 It means that nothing<br />can go through it.
1679046 1681299 No bullets. Nothing.
1681424 1685262 She told me that if I wore it,<br />nothing would hurt me.
1685387 1690350 So I did. And my whole life,<br />I never got shot, stabbed.
1690475 1693395 Nothing.<br />I mean, how weird is that?
1693478 1697441 Only she told me that I was supposed to give it<br />to my daughter on her fifth birthday.
1697566 1699319 And I forgot.
1699444 1700904 Can I touch it?
1701070 1703072 Sure, go ahead.
1705491 1708494 - I don't feel it.<br />- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?
1708661 1712499 I can take it off and tie it around your<br />shoulders. She told me how to do it.
1712625 1716253 - Unless you think it's stupid.<br />- Don't you need it?
1716337 1719131 No, not anymore.
1719256 1722176 So what do you think?<br />You want it?
1728475 1730185 Okay, let's get outta here.
1735941 1736900 Okay.
1750873 1753543 Put your head up.
1758549 1761218 Okay. Is that too tight?
1761343 1763804 Do you feel anything at all?
1763887 1766306 Good. Then it's just right.
1772605 1775066 Do I take it off<br />when I have a bath?
1775233 1777986 No, you leave it on<br />all the time.
1778069 1783450 Until you have a daughter when she turns five,<br />then you give it to her.
1783576 1784869 Okay?
1785744 1786704 Okay.
1789123 1792585 Okay. Good night, sweetie.
1793752 1796298 Good night.
1835631 1839052 Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music<br />of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.
1839969 1843223 How in the lunacy of your mind<br />is hip-hop music of the oppressor?
1843306 1846601 Listen to it, man!<br />"Nigger this, nigger that. "
1846684 1850146 You think white people go around calling<br />each other honkies all day, man?
1850271 1851689 "Hey, honky, how's business?"
1851814 1853776 "Going great, cracker.<br />We're diversifying. "
1853859 1858656 How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?<br />Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.
1858781 1860491 And you think<br />there's a difference, don't you? Huh?
1860616 1864703 <i>Gonna buy me a rope<br />and lynch me a nigger</i>
1864828 1867999 You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop<br />music comes from, do you?
1868124 1870669 <i>I'd shoot 'em dead first<br />but I done broke my trigger</i>
1870835 1873046 See, back in the '60s we had<br />smart, articulate black men.
1873171 1875465 <i>Gonna get out my sheet<br />Put my hood on my head</i>
1875590 1878510 Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,<br />Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.
1878593 1879970 <i>Gonna string 'em up good</i>
1880053 1881847 These brothers were speaking out,<br />and people were listening!
1881973 1883641 <i>Then they'll be dead</i>
1883766 1885768 Then the FBI said,<br />"No, we can't have that. "
1885851 1888646 <i>Home of the brave<br />and the land of the free</i>
1888771 1890815 "Let's give the niggers<br />this music by a bunch of mumbling idiots
1890940 1893651 and sooner or later,<br />they'll all copy it, and nobody
1893776 1895779 will be able to understand<br />a fucking word they say.
1895862 1898031 End of problem. "
1905038 1906331 What the fuck was that, dawg?
1920680 1922891 - Holy shit!<br />- What?
1923016 1924560 Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.
1925811 1927521 You're sayin' there's a Chinaman<br />under this truck?
1927646 1928731 What part don't you understand?
1928856 1931692 There's a Chinaman stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck.
1934111 1935070 Help me.
1935237 1937866 Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
1938033 1941703 Ah, God. What the hell did he do,<br />just leap out in front of the truck?
1942579 1944873 Man! This is so<br />completely fucked up.
1944956 1946833 Oh, really? No shit!
1946917 1950003 Okay, hold up.<br />Hold up, hold up, hold up.
1950086 1952089 - Get back in the truck.<br />- What?
1952173 1954383 - Yes, get back in the truck.<br />- You think we didn't drag him far enough?
1954467 1957345 No, we gonna drive away.<br />And he gonna let go.
1957428 1959138 He's not gonna let go, Anthony.
1959263 1962350 You know why? Because he's stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck!
1962433 1967689 Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've<br />considered that option half a block back.
1967773 1971235 What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms<br />and pull him from underneath.
1971401 1972986 You grab his arm,<br />it's gonna fall off.
1973111 1975906 Then you gonna be standing in the street<br />holding a Chinaman's arm.
1975989 1977908 Then what your ass gonna do, huh?
1978825 1982372 If we leave this man here, he dies.<br />Then we're up for murder charges.
1983373 1986417 Just grab his arm.<br />We'll just pull him out.
1991631 1994927 I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.<br />I just want a new partner.
1995010 1997096 I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.
1997179 1999598 But you don't wanna stir up<br />any bad feelings with him.
1999723 2001517 He's been on the force for a long time.
2001642 2003769 Seventeen years.
2003936 2006105 And I do have to work here, sir.
2006272 2008650 So you don't mind<br />that there's a racist prick on the force.
2008775 2011736 You just don't want him<br />to ride in your car.
2011820 2014614 If you need me to go on record<br />about this, sir, I will.
2014739 2016533 That'd be great.<br />Write a full report.
2016658 2019452 Because I'm anxious to<br />understand how an obvious bigot
2019536 2022498 could've gone undetected<br />in this department for 17 years.
2022582 2024750 Eleven of which he was under<br />my personal supervision.
2024834 2027253 Which doesn't speak very highly<br />of my managerial skills.
2027336 2031048 But that's not your concern.<br />I can't wait to read it.
2031173 2035052 What if I said I wanted a new partner<br />for personal reasons?
2035177 2038432 So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,<br />you just don't like him.
2038557 2041435 - Yes, sir.<br />- That's not a good enough reason.
2041518 2044438 Then I guess I should think of a better one<br />and get back to you.
2044521 2047482 So you think I'm asking you<br />to make one up.
2047566 2052322 Uh, no, sir. I just can't<br />think of one... right now.
2052447 2054532 You wanna know what I heard?
2055992 2058036 I heard it was a case<br />of uncontrollable flatulence.
2058161 2060288 You want me to say<br />he has flatulence?
2060371 2063166 Not him. You.<br />You have uncontrollable flatulence.
2063249 2066712 You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody<br />else so you're requesting a one-man car.
2066837 2069757 I'm not... comfortable with that,<br />Lieutenant.
2069882 2072801 I wouldn't be either. Which is why<br />I understand your need for privacy.
2072885 2076680 Just like I'm sure you understand how hard<br />a black man has to work to get to,
2076764 2079893 say, where I am, in a racist fucking<br />organization like the L.A.P.D.
2080018 2083021 And how easily<br />that can be taken away.
2083146 2086233 Now, that being said,<br />it's your decision.
2086358 2091154 You can put your career and mine on the line<br />in pursuit of a just cause,
2091238 2095159 or you can admit to having<br />an embarrassing problem
2095243 2097536 of a personal nature.
2100873 2102833 Fuck.
2133241 2134200 Excuse me.
2135619 2138163 Excuse me. Sir?
2138289 2139540 You finished?
2139665 2143419 I replaced the lock.<br />But you got a real problem with that door.
2143544 2146005 You fix the lock?
2146130 2150260 Nah, I replaced the lock.<br />But you gotta fix that door.
2150385 2153763 - Just fix the lock!<br />- Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.
2153889 2157058 What you need<br />is a new door.
2157142 2159603 - I need new door?<br />- Yeah.
2159686 2162147 Okay. How much?
2162272 2166193 I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call<br />somebody that sells doors.
2166319 2170406 You try to cheat me, right?<br />You have a friend that fix door?
2170531 2172658 Nah, I don't have a friend<br />that fix doors, bro.
2172825 2175119 Then go and fix the fucking lock, you cheater.
2175244 2177998 You... You know what?
2178123 2181585 Why don't you just pay for the lock<br />and I won't charge you for the time.
2181668 2184087 You don't fix the lock!<br />I pay! You think I'm stupid?
2184171 2187341 You fix the fucking lock,<br />you cheater!
2187466 2189927 - I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.<br />- Then fix the fucking lock!
2190052 2193514 I replaced the lock!<br />You gotta fix the fucking door!
2193598 2196809 You cheat!<br />You fucking cheater!
2196935 2199646 - Fine. Don't pay.<br />- What?
2199729 2202482 - Have a good night.<br />- What? No. Wait!
2202607 2205569 Wait! You come back here!<br />You fix the lock!
2205694 2207821 Come here! You fix my lock!
2207988 2209448 Fix the fucking lock!
2215704 2219626 I understand. You run over a Chinaman.<br />Stuff him in the back.
2219751 2222629 Then bring the truck here<br />so I can share in the experience.
2222712 2225548 Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.<br />It'll wash right off.
2225674 2227968 - Georgie, burn this thing.<br />- Burn it?
2228051 2230303 It's a brand-new Navigator.<br />All you need is a little piece of carpet.
2230387 2232389 You watch the Discovery Channel?
2232514 2235893 - Not a lot.<br />- They got some good shit on that channel.
2236060 2239605 Every night there is a show<br />with somebody shining a blue light
2239730 2243943 and finding tiny specks of blood splattered<br />on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,
2244068 2248574 bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic<br />Burger King tray cups.
2248699 2252160 The next thing they show is some stupid<br />redneck in handcuffs
2252286 2256498 who looks absolutely stunned<br />that this is happening to him.
2256582 2259626 Sometimes the redneck is actually watching<br />the Discovery Channel
2259751 2261713 when they break in to arrest him.
2261838 2267051 And he still can't figure out how on earth<br />they could've caught him!
2275018 2278898 Do I look like I wanna be<br />on the Discovery Channel?
2279023 2280232 No.
2280316 2282902 Then get the fuck<br />outta my shop.
2285404 2287531 Oh, yeah, make sure<br />you get that.
2287615 2291036 Without him, things could've gone really<br />fucking wrong tonight.
2293121 2296917 - Fuck!<br />- Don't! Don't you dare.
2297000 2298877 Don't.
2298960 2302088 Graham Waters.
2302213 2306427 No. No, he's not here, Mom.
2307929 2310890 I'm not gonna go looking for him.
2311015 2314310 Look, he'll be home when...<br />Just leave it alone.
2314435 2319107 Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?<br />I'm having sex with a white woman.
2319191 2321610 Okay, where were we?
2321735 2324196 I was white, and you were<br />about to jerk off in the shower.
2324321 2327157 Oh, shit!
2327282 2329326 Come on.
2329451 2334415 I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't<br />think it would've pissed her off as much.
2334499 2336793 Why do you keep everybody<br />at a certain distance, huh?
2336960 2340588 - What, you start to feel something and panic?<br />- Come on, Maria.
2340713 2344175 You're just pissed<br />'cause I answered the phone.
2344259 2346637 That's just where<br />I begin to get pissed.
2346720 2350057 I mean, really, what kind of man<br />speaks to his mother that way?
2350182 2354228 Oh, this is about my mother.<br />What do you know about my mother?
2354353 2357273 If I was your father,<br />I'd kick your fucking ass.
2358732 2360735 Okay. I was raised badly.
2360860 2364281 Why don't you take your clothes off,<br />get back into bed and teach me a lesson?
2364364 2368326 You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.<br />How 'bout a geography lesson?
2368451 2372581 My father's from Puerto Rico.<br />My mother's from El Salvador.
2372706 2375751 Neither one of those is Mexico.
2375876 2378337 Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is
2378421 2381882 who gathered all those<br />remarkably different cultures together
2382008 2385052 and taught them all how<br />to park their cars on their lawns?
2412874 2415209 Pop, you okay?
2415335 2418339 If I could piss, I'd be okay.
2419924 2422635 I'm... Jesus.
2422760 2425220 I'm done now.
2425346 2427348 Give me a hand.
2429892 2431811 Wait a goddamn minute!
2431937 2434564 - Wait a minute.<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2436608 2440028 All right. Okay. Okay.
2447453 2450039 Wait, wait, wait.<br />Stop, stop!
2450122 2452792 - I gotta go back.<br />- Okay.
2465097 2468183 What, are you gonna<br />stand there and stare at me?
2537174 2539801 - So Conklin just shot him?<br />- Mm-hmm.
2539927 2541595 - They know each other?<br />- Sir.
2541720 2542846 It's a grudge thing?
2542971 2544849 Not as far as we can tell.
2546225 2548019 You think this is<br />racially motivated?
2548102 2551439 Well, a dozen people heard the shots.<br />Nobody saw anything.
2551564 2553524 - Who do we have on it?<br />- Graham Waters.
2553608 2557613 Waters. All right. Well, tell him<br />he speaks to no one but me.
2557738 2560866 Call a press conference for 4:00,<br />and I want Waters here at 3:30.
2560991 2562868 And would someone<br />please find Flanagan.
2564912 2566538 Oh! What up, Mo Phat?
2568249 2572545 Man robs purses from old ladies and you,<br />"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"
2572712 2575674 That nigger will steal teeth<br />from a cripple, man.
2575840 2578343 You callin' him a thief?<br />And we do what?
2578468 2580387 The man steals<br />from black people.
2580470 2584724 Only reason black people steal from their own<br />is 'cause they terrified of white people.
2584808 2586060 Oh, man, please.
2586185 2589563 Think about it. Sherman Oaks.<br />Burbank. Santa Monica.
2589647 2592233 All scary-ass places<br />for a brother to find himself.
2592316 2594735 Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks<br />in Toluca Lake,
2594819 2598948 that nigger will run like a rabbit soon<br />as somebody say "decaf latte. "
2599073 2602286 What the fuck did you do to my car?
2609710 2613130 Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.
2613255 2616217 I turn key to my car, but nothing.
2616301 2618261 James wanted to take this to school.
2618344 2621055 But I don't want the kids to fight over it.
2621139 2624892 - Are these clean or dirty?<br />- All clean, senora!
2624976 2629898 You know, Maria, just once I would like to<br />wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.
2631233 2633777 <i>Si, senora.<br />No problem.</i>
2635362 2637114 I'm startin' to understand now.
2637281 2640159 By your work, you're settin' an example<br />for our neighborhood.
2640284 2642746 Sort of like a big brother<br />kind of thing, right?
2643788 2645248 Yeah, you laugh, man.
2645373 2649502 But you have never seen me steal<br />from a black person ever in your life.
2651546 2653673 What the hell do you think<br />you doin' right now, man?
2653798 2655258 Wavin' down the bus.
2655342 2657845 Put your hand down, dawg!<br />Are you outta your mind?
2657970 2660348 You actually expect me<br />to get on a bus?
2660473 2662725 No. I was hopin' we could<br />push your car across town.
2662850 2664769 You know why? 'Cause we just don't<br />do stuff like that no more.
2664852 2667480 You have no idea, do you?
2667605 2671109 You have no idea why they put them great big<br />windows on the sides of buses, do you?
2671234 2673737 - Why?<br />- One reason only.
2673862 2678200 To humiliate the people of color<br />who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.
2678325 2679660 I didn't know that.
2679785 2682746 You could fill the Staples Center<br />with what you don't know.
2682871 2684832 You know the Kings<br />are playin' tonight.
2684916 2688294 You don't like hockey! The only reason<br />you say you do is to piss me off!
2688378 2690672 I love hockey.
2690797 2692340 Cut! Print. Moving on.
2692465 2693591 Okay, that takes us into scene 12.
2693675 2695009 Okay, that takes us into scene 12.
2696761 2699807 Jamal, that's what<br />I'm talking about.
2699890 2701267 Right on.
2703185 2706605 - Cam, you got a second?<br />- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.
2706730 2709483 Yeah. Listen. I think<br />we need another take, buddy.
2709566 2712319 That looked<br />pretty terrific, man.
2712403 2716574 This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal<br />seeing a speech coach or something?
2716700 2718618 What do you mean?
2718743 2722163 Have you noticed, uh...<br />This is weird for a white guy to say,
2722289 2726042 but have you noticed<br />he's talking a lot less black lately?
2728170 2729630 No, I haven't noticed that.
2729755 2733718 Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed to<br />say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that. "
2733843 2736178 And he changed it to,<br />"Don't talk to me about that. "
2736304 2737555 Wait a minute.
2737722 2742227 You think because of that, the audience<br />won't recognize him as being a black man?
2742394 2743353 Come on!
2743478 2745522 Is there a problem, Cam?
2745689 2747274 Excuse me?
2747399 2749693 Is there a problem, Cam?
2754615 2757118 No, we don't have a problem.
2757243 2760413 I mean, 'cause all I'm saying<br />is it's not his character.
2760538 2763124 Eddie's supposed to be<br />the smart one, not Jamal, right?
2763249 2767045 You're the expert here.<br />But to me, it rings false.
2770424 2774219 - We're gonna do it one more time.<br />- Thanks, buddy.
2774303 2778265 Everybody back.<br />Let's do it one more time.
2780809 2782895 Jamal, um...
2787108 2788735 Morning, Carol.<br />Who do I have?
2788818 2790153 Hold for a minute, please.
2790278 2794449 Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,<br />but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.
2797703 2800456 Send him in.
2800539 2802833 - Mr. Ryan.<br />- Yeah.
2802959 2805127 My name is Shaniqua Johnson.
2805252 2807797 I believe we spoke last night.
2807964 2811385 Oh, yeah. I wanted<br />to apologize about that.
2811510 2814513 I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.<br />My father's in a lot of pain.
2814638 2817099 Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.
2817224 2821311 This doctor he's been seein'<br />says he's got a urinary tract infection.
2821436 2824940 But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,<br />and he keeps gettin' worse.
2825023 2827068 And he's been back to see<br />Dr. Robertson?
2827193 2829862 Yeah. Between you and me,<br />the man's an idiot.
2829988 2831906 - Really?<br />- No offense.
2832031 2835451 But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.<br />I think his nurses are doing most of the work.
2835535 2840624 Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's welcome<br />to see a doctor outside the network.
2840749 2845170 And if this new doctor<br />says it's not an infection,
2845296 2848424 says it's his prostate and it needs to be<br />operated on, is that gonna be covered?
2848549 2852136 - Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...<br />- What good is that gonna do?
2852219 2854931 I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
2855056 2857392 All right.<br />You know what I can't do?
2858727 2861313 I can't look at you without<br />thinking about the five or six
2861396 2863773 more qualified white men<br />who didn't get your job.
2863898 2865609 It's time for you to go.
2865734 2868863 I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping<br />that I'm wrong about you.
2868946 2870573 I'm hoping that someone like yourself,
2870740 2872950 someone who may have been<br />given a helping hand,
2873075 2875870 might have a little compassion<br />for someone in a similar situation.
2875953 2877997 Carol, I need security in my office!
2878164 2881167 You don't like me, that's fine.<br />I'm a prick.
2881292 2883879 My father doesn't deserve<br />to suffer like this.
2883962 2886006 He was a janitor.<br />He struggled his whole life.
2886089 2887924 Saved enough to start<br />his own company.
2888050 2890010 Twenty-three employees,<br />all of them black.
2890093 2892804 Paid 'em equal wages<br />when no one else was doing that.
2892929 2897769 For 30 years he worked side by side with<br />those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.
2897894 2899729 Then the city council decides to give
2899854 2903107 minority-owned companies<br />preference in city contracts.
2903274 2905985 And overnight,<br />my father loses everything.
2906110 2909530 His business, his home, his wife.<br />Everything!
2909614 2913285 Not once does he blame your people.
2913410 2916872 I'm not asking you to help me.
2916997 2921335 I'm asking that you do this small thing<br />for a man who lost everything
2921460 2923754 so people like yourself<br />could reap the benefits.
2923880 2926174 And do you know<br />what it's gonna cost you?
2926299 2928218 Nothing.
2928301 2930261 Just a flick of your pen.
2931805 2934766 Your father sounds<br />like a good man.
2934849 2938980 And if he'd come in here today, I probably<br />would've approved this request.
2939146 2943567 But he didn't come in. You did.<br />And for his sake, it's a real shame.
2943651 2946612 Get him the hell outta my office.
2950700 2953620 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
2953704 2958333 Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you<br />you needed to replace or repair the door.
2958458 2960127 He say he fix the lock.
2960210 2962796 <i>- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!<br />- You're yelling again.</i>
2962921 2964798 I am not yelling! I'm upset!
2964923 2967302 Yes... Yes, I am.
2967385 2969012 Mom, are you all right?
2969178 2973391 Stop washing.<br />Insurance must take picture.
2973516 2974976 Okay?
2976394 2978771 Look what they wrote.
2978855 2980858 They think we're Arab.
2980983 2983027 When did Persian become Arab?
2983152 2985988 I want his name. Yes.
2986071 2987656 Oh, my God.
2987781 2990826 - I want his name! Give me his name!<br />- Dad?
2990951 2992328 I'm not giving you his name, sir.
2992411 2996207 - Dad, did they take the gun?<br />- Not fix my lock! I want his name!
2996333 2998335 I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
2998460 3002213 Don't hang up! Shit!
3002339 3004174 Oh, thank God.
3050098 3051392 Mom?
3053143 3055396 Mom, it's cold. Come on.
3077627 3079922 Did you find your brother?
3082091 3084218 No, Mom.
3093687 3096231 I was doin' good.
3097524 3100986 I was... I was doin' real good.
3102821 3105115 - I know, Mom.<br />- I was doin'...
3110038 3111956 It's okay.
3123344 3125512 Did you find your brother?
3127848 3130267 No, Mom.
3131602 3134104 Tell him to come home.
3135523 3140820 Tell him I'm not mad, okay?<br />Okay, baby?
3140945 3143490 Okay, Mom.
3143657 3146117 Okay, baby.
3146242 3147827 Okay.
3148870 3150915 Okay.
3186536 3189455 - Did you apologize to your mother?<br />- She wasn't there.
3191416 3195045 Internal Affairs called.<br />Found something in the Mercedes.
3197840 3200050 That's lunch. One hour.
3229290 3231083 I tried to call.
3231208 3233336 Sounded like you're havin'<br />a bad day, huh?
3233461 3234755 Yeah.
3239259 3241053 What?
3242054 3244014 I got scared, Cam.
3244139 3249562 It's not like I haven't been<br />pulled over before. You know?
3249687 3251689 But not like that.
3253024 3255026 And, yes, I was a little drunk.
3255151 3259072 And I was mouthing off.
3259155 3261366 I'm sorry.
3263494 3265245 But when that man was<br />putting his hands on me...
3265329 3267039 I don't wanna talk about it.
3267164 3270459 I can't believe<br />you let him do that, baby.
3271835 3275422 Look, I know what you did<br />was the right thing. Okay?
3277008 3279719 But I was humiliated!
3279844 3281972 For you.
3282097 3286559 I just couldn't stand to see<br />that man take away your dignity.
3286685 3289688 Yeah. That's what happened.
3289813 3292817 - Oh, baby, don't do this.<br />- No. No, you're right.
3292942 3294694 I ain't doin' it.
3294819 3297321 You gonna walk away from me?
3297446 3300616 - Cameron!<br />- Just go home.
3306665 3308000 Mm-hmm.
3309543 3310502 I understand.
3312546 3313797 Thanks.
3317175 3320555 - Has your father read his policy?<br />- He doesn't read English.
3324392 3326686 Mr. Golzari, you said<br />you called the locksmith?
3328521 3329689 Yes. I tell him, fix it.
3330606 3336905 They said their man told you to fix the door,<br />and you didn't do so.
3338949 3340951 Are you saying it's his fault?
3342286 3346707 Insurance company is calling it negligence.<br />They're not covering any of this.
3354382 3359512 No. This store is all we have.
3376698 3378700 I really am sorry.
3401307 3403435 What time<br />you must go to work?
3403602 3404812 Not until tonight.
3406605 3408065 Go home and sleep.
3411318 3413904 It's okay. It's okay.<br />Go home and sleep.
3437179 3438222 Hey.
3440016 3443436 Maybe they didn't tell you,<br />but I've been reassigned.
3443519 3445731 Yeah, they told me.
3445856 3448650 I just wanted to say, good luck
3448734 3450569 and it was good ridin' with you.
3450652 3452321 You too.
3455365 3458618 Wait till you've been<br />on the job a few more years.
3458702 3461914 - Yeah.<br />- Look at me, look at me.
3462040 3466669 Wait till you've been doin' it<br />a little longer.
3466753 3470673 You think you know<br />who you are, hmm?
3470798 3473551 You have no idea.
3477056 3480100 Yo, Gomez,<br />you ready to roll, homie?
3480225 3482019 Ready, amigo.

3749597 3753101 No! Get your filthy<br />fucking hands off me!
3753184 3757356 Stop moving. Lady, I'm not<br />gonna fucking hurt you!
3762319 3765447 Okay. Okay.
3765531 3767408 Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.
3767533 3771287 I'm not gonna touch you.<br />But there's nobody else here yet
3771413 3773373 and that's gasoline there.
3775041 3778336 We need to get you<br />outta here right away. Okay?
3778420 3780630 Oh, my... Oh, my...<br />Oh, my... Oh, my God.
3780714 3786429 Okay. I need to reach across your lap.<br />Can I do that, please?
3789724 3791684 Yeah. Yeah.
3793060 3794729 Thanks.
3798734 3802487 Is anything broken?
3802571 3805032 L- I don't think so.
3805157 3808035 Okay. Then that's good.
3808160 3810662 Are you... Are you<br />gonna get me out?
3810787 3814042 Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?
3814167 3817503 Look at me. Look at me.<br />I'm gonna get you out.
3823718 3825178 Oh, fuck!
3825261 3828265 - I'm sorry.<br />- That's okay.
3830392 3833187 I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?
3833270 3835356 I'm gonna have to cut the belt.
3836523 3837983 It's okay, it's okay.
3838108 3840695 It's okay.<br />Okay, we're gonna get you out.
3840862 3843156 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />Look at me!
3843239 3845742 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />We're gonna get you outta here.
3845867 3847661 Everything's gonna be fine.
3864220 3866681 Ryan!
3901969 3903387 Pull!
3918653 3919988 It's okay.
3929457 3930875 It's okay.
3931876 3935504 All right.<br />It's okay, it's okay.
3935588 3938049 It's all right.<br />I got it. I got it.
3938174 3940177 Ma'am? Ma'am,<br />can you walk with me?
3940302 3942679 It's cool, it's cool.
3944056 3947059 Here we go.<br />All right, you're doin' great.
3978258 3981471 The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.<br />He really wanted to be here himself.
3981554 3984307 No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work<br />none of us would have jobs.
3984391 3986685 - Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.<br />- Graham Waters.
3986768 3989604 - Thanks for coming in.<br />- He just pulled into the garage.
3989729 3992857 Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,<br />so we'll make this short.
3992941 3996320 Internal Affairs says this Conklin<br />has two suspicious shootings on his record.
3996404 3999699 Both black men.<br />Both times he was cleared, but only just.
3999782 4002576 Detective Lewis<br />makes black man number three.
4002702 4006163 You know any reason why<br />we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?
4006288 4011294 Well, it's more complicated<br />than we originally thought.
4011420 4017300 We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car<br />that Detective Lewis was driving.
4017426 4019469 Shit!
4019594 4024058 Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him<br />to stay in the car until he hears from me.
4024183 4028104 You found the money in the Mercedes.<br />I thought that wasn't his car.
4028187 4032400 The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.<br />We haven't been able to get in touch with her.
4032483 4035611 Apparently she, uh,<br />left town this morning.
4035737 4039533 So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have<br />known the money was in it.
4045956 4049209 You really think you're gonna<br />be able to make that fly?
4050919 4051963 Give us a minute.
4053631 4055800 No problem.
4063308 4065477 Who knows about the money?
4065603 4067605 You gotta be kiddin' me.
4067730 4071609 There are only two people<br />in this room.
4071734 4075071 Myself, my partner,<br />Ferguson and Internal Affairs.
4075154 4077656 - Jim Ferguson?<br />- Yeah.
4082162 4084623 Okay. I guess<br />I don't see a problem.
4084706 4087250 As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't<br />clear evidence of any wrongdoing.
4087334 4090337 And even if it was, we aren't<br />going to prosecute a dead man.
4090420 4094842 Which means the money Internal Affairs<br />is holding can't be considered evidence.
4094926 4097220 You can do this dance if you want to,
4097345 4100807 but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report<br />comes back tomorrow
4100890 4103851 it's going to say that Detective Lewis<br />was coked out of his head.
4105353 4106813 Fucking black people, huh?
4106896 4108941 What did you just say?
4109066 4111026 I mean,
4111151 4113654 I know all the sociological<br />reasons why per capita
4113779 4116824 eight times more black men<br />are incarcerated than white men.
4116949 4120828 Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.<br />Bias in the judicial system.
4120911 4122872 All that stuff.<br />All that stuff!
4122997 4127043 But still, it's gotta get to you,<br />on a gut level as a black man,
4127168 4130088 they just can't keep their hands<br />out of the cookie jar.
4135343 4137430 Of course, you and I<br />know that's not the truth.
4137555 4139515 But that's the way<br />it always plays, doesn't it?
4139682 4143102 And assholes like Lewis keep<br />feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.
4144395 4146689 What did you say<br />you did for the D.A. Again?
4146772 4148733 You coach ball down in Compton.<br />Am I right?
4148858 4150777 Oh, please, don't do that.
4151570 4153697 Don't act like you know<br />something about me, okay?
4153822 4158243 What do you think those kids need...<br />to make them believe, to give them hope?
4158326 4160495 You think they need another<br />drug-dealing cop
4160579 4163540 or do you think they need<br />a fallen black hero?
4163623 4168212 Why don't you cut through the bullshit<br />and just tell me what it is you want.
4170256 4173051 The D.A.'s squad loses<br />its lead investigator next month.
4173176 4177055 Rick is quite adamant<br />that his replacement be a person of color.
4177138 4181310 It's a high-profile position, and he wants<br />to send the right message to the community.
4181435 4185105 And the right message is,<br />"Look at this black boy I just bought?"
4185189 4188776 Well, fuck you very much.<br />But thanks for thinking of me.
4190152 4192572 Actually we were thinking of you.
4193948 4195909 Until we saw that.
4196868 4198078 It's your brother's file.
4199079 4201289 Twenty-something years old<br />and already three felonies.
4201414 4204125 Three strikes law. Kid's going away<br />for life for stealing a car.
4204250 4206921 Christ, that's a shitty law.
4207046 4208964 There's a warrant in there.
4209090 4213427 But still, hey, he had<br />every opportunity you had.
4216263 4218140 Fucking black people, huh?
4222521 4226983 So all, uh... all I need to do<br />to make this disappear
4227067 4229361 is to frame<br />a potentially innocent man?
4229486 4232781 What are you? The fucking defender<br />of all things white?
4232864 4236619 We're talking about a white man<br />who shot three black men.
4236703 4241457 And you're arguing with me that maybe<br />we're not being fair to him?
4241582 4244544 You know what? Maybe you're right.<br />Maybe Lewis did provoke this.
4244669 4246838 And maybe he got exactly<br />what was coming to him.
4246921 4249925 Or maybe stoned or not,<br />just being a black man in the Valley
4250008 4252344 was enough to get him killed.
4252469 4256515 There was no one there to see who shot first,<br />so there is no way to know.
4256640 4260018 Which means we<br />could get this wrong.
4261854 4264941 Maybe that's what happened with<br />your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.
4265025 4269487 Maybe Lewis isn't the only one<br />who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
4270405 4272198 You're the one closest to all this.
4272323 4274075 You need to tell us.
4277913 4280374 What does your gut tell you?
4293138 4296308 So? Graham?
4296391 4298518 What do I tell 'em?
4298643 4302564 You tell me, and I'll tell them.
4309238 4313409 Well, I think given<br />Detective Conklin's history,
4313493 4316537 it's pretty clear<br />what happened last night.
4316662 4319207 Okay.
4335850 4338103 <i>Before I get to why we're here,</i>
4338269 4342190 I know that many of you have heard<br />we had our car stolen last night.
4342273 4346653 And as you could imagine, my wife and I<br />are both pretty shaken up.
4346778 4348614 But we're okay.
4348698 4353327 And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls<br />and your concern. Thank you.
4353452 4359041 Now, just after 9:00 p. m. Last night,<br />Detective William Lewis,
4359125 4362295 an eight-year veteran of the force<br />and an active member of the black community,
4362421 4364631 was gunned down<br />by a fellow officer.
4425154 4426363 Get outta the car!
4426447 4428324 Gimme the keys!<br />Get out... What the fuck?
4430326 4432329 Whoa! What the fuck<br />are you doing, man?
4432454 4434331 Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?
4434414 4435332 Say that again!
4437417 4439628 - Say that again!<br />- You stupid motherfucker!
4439753 4443048 Say it again, huh!<br />Call me a nigger again!
4443173 4445550 - Man, what the fuck? Get off!<br />- Fuck you!
4445634 4448471 - Shoot him!<br />- I'll blow your head off!
4448554 4451641 - Shoot this motherfucker!<br />- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!
4451724 4452850 Stop talkin' and shoot!
4454227 4457105 - Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.<br />- Get off of me!
4459232 4461985 Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!
4462069 4464071 - Oh, shit.<br />- Anthony! Anthony!
4466615 4467908 Get the fuck outta my car!
4467991 4470244 Shit! Damn!
4470369 4472579 - What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!<br />- Fuck you!
4476584 4479921 Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.<br />West bound.
4480672 4482882 I will blow you away!<br />Get the fuck out of the car!
4482966 4484426 Go on! Shoot me then!
4486136 4490474 2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...<br />Oh, Christ!
4496063 4498274 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- You get the fuck outta the car!
4498357 4500735 - Get outta the fucking car!<br />- It's my fucking car!
4500818 4503196 - It's my fucking gun!<br />- Fuck, it's my gun now!
4503280 4505490 Gimme my fucking gun!
4512831 4514624 Fuck!
4516376 4520298 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4523176 4527180 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4530475 4533020 Slowly step out of the vehicle.
4533145 4536815 - Get out of my car.<br />- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.
4539943 4543739 Turn off the engine.<br />Throw the keys out the window.
4556378 4559715 You fucking want me?<br />Here I am, you pig fuck!
4559840 4561175 Lie face down on the ground.
4561300 4563969 - Spread your arms and legs.<br />- No, you lie face down!
4564053 4566138 Don't come any closer!<br />Down on your knees!
4566263 4568724 Fuck you! What are you gonna do?<br />Pull the fucking trigger!
4568849 4569767 On your knees now!
4569850 4572603 You get on your knees<br />and suck my fucking dick!
4572728 4575440 Do I look like<br />I'm fucking joking with you?
4575565 4577109 That's what you look like,<br />a fucking joke to me.
4577234 4579444 - This man is making threatening gestures.<br />- Threatening gestures?
4579528 4581863 You wanna see a threatening gesture?<br />I got a threatening gesture.
4581988 4585700 - I know this man! I know this man!<br />- Get back.
4585784 4588329 - Give me some space. I know this guy.<br />- Get outta the way.
4588413 4589497 Step away.
4589622 4591666 Give me some goddamn room.<br />I know this guy.
4593543 4596087 - Man, don't walk up on me!<br />- See what's happening here?
4596212 4598381 Do you wanna die here, huh?<br />Is that what you want?
4598506 4600466 'Cause these guys<br />really wanna shoot you.
4600550 4603137 And the way you're acting,<br />they'll be completely fucking justified.
4603220 4604471 Fuck you!
4604555 4607891 Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.<br />You're the one.
4608016 4610894 'Cause you're the one<br />whose head's gonna be blown off!
4610978 4612229 Officer Hanson, step away.
4612354 4615817 He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a fucking<br />friend! This man is not armed!
4615942 4618862 He's not gonna shoot you, me,<br />or anybody else, all right?
4618945 4620989 So give me two goddamn seconds.<br />Can you do that?
4621072 4624367 Lower your firearm.<br />Lower your firearm!
4629582 4632835 You startin' to understand<br />the situation?
4632918 4635588 What do you want from me?
4635713 4640217 Unless you think your wife is better off with<br />a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,
4640384 4642261 I want you to sit on that curb,<br />put your hands on your head
4642386 4644598 and do nothing until I speak with these officers.
4644723 4647684 I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'<br />my hands on my head for nobody.
4647809 4651813 Then stand where you are and keep your<br />hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?
4654900 4657069 Yeah, I can do that.
4657152 4659405 Good.
4659489 4663284 I told this man to stay where he is and keep his<br />hands in plain sight.
4663409 4668164 This man better be related to you by blood<br />because this is fucking nuts.
4668289 4670374 I need this favor.
4670458 4674505 You can check the guy's name, his license.<br />He's got no priors, no warrants.
4674630 4677174 I need to let him go<br />with a warning.
4677299 4682179 - What kind of fucking warning?<br />- A harsh warning.
4684765 4686643 Thank you.
4689479 4693525 You've been warned. Do you understand me?<br />Do you understand me!
4693650 4696903 You want something from me?<br />'Cause I'm right here.
4696986 4701033 - I'm trying to help you.<br />- I didn't ask for your help, did I?
4703160 4705371 Go home.
4709041 4711377 Yeah, that I can do.
4789961 4791880 Look at me.
4793340 4796009 You embarrass me.
4796093 4798220 You embarrass yourself.
4841392 4842351 Daddy's home!
4863206 4864291 - What's up?<br />- Give me my money!
4864374 4866835 - What? What money?<br />- Daddy!
4866918 4870173 - To pay for my store. Give me my money!<br />- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!
4870298 4871799 Give me my money!
4873342 4876429 - I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!<br />- That's not my truck!
4876554 4878890 - Daddy?<br />- Elizabeth!
4879015 4883270 Hey, you know what?<br />Hey, I got $50. Here.
4883353 4885439 Fifty dollars?<br />You took everything!
4885522 4886190 Mommy?
4887983 4889568 I'm coming, I'm coming!
4889693 4893864 - He doesn't have it.<br />- Hasn't got what?
4893989 4898203 I have it. He doesn't<br />have the impenetrable cloak!
4899412 4901039 Lara, stay outta the street!
4928693 4932364 - It's okay, Daddy.<br />- What... What?
4932447 4933907 I'll protect you.
4961186 4963856 It's okay. Daddy's okay.
4963939 4966984 It's a really good cloak.
5034056 5039020 I sent her out for groceries,<br />and that was two hours ago, Carol.
5039187 5041022 Well, you are one to talk.
5041147 5045026 You go through, like,<br />six housekeepers a year?
5045110 5048530 I'm not snapping at you!<br />I am angry.
5049781 5051825 Yes! At them! Yes!
5051950 5056288 At them, the police,<br />at Rick, at Maria,
5056372 5060084 at the dry cleaners who destroyed<br />another blouse today,
5060209 5064171 at the gardener who keeps<br />overwatering the lawn.
5064255 5065423 I...
5066675 5069177 I just thought that...
5069302 5072848 Carol, I just thought that<br />I would wake up today
5072973 5075934 and I would feel better, you know?
5076059 5080021 But I was still mad.<br />And I realized...
5080147 5084068 I realized that it had nothing<br />to do with my car being stolen.
5086070 5089866 I wake up like this<br />every morning!
5089949 5093911 I am angry all the time,<br />and I don't know why.
5094036 5097374 Carol, I don't know why! And I...
5099042 5102087 Yeah, yeah, call me back.
5102212 5104089 Bye.
5215250 5217210 Really appreciate this.
5217335 5219504 You're welcome.
5225386 5227263 So how long you been out there tonight?<br />It's cold.
5227388 5229515 Hour maybe.
5229599 5231392 Big surprise, huh?
5231517 5234771 Yeah, this ain't exactly<br />"pick up a brother" territory.
5234896 5236648 True.
5236732 5238734 So where you headed?
5238859 5240986 Anywhere the other side<br />of the hill.
5244406 5246700 That's some good music.
5246784 5248702 Mm-hmm.

5975856 5979485 she said she couldn't come get me because<br />she was getting a massage.
5979610 5981987 That's because she's a bitch.
5982071 5984950 She's been my friend for ten years.
5986117 5988036 <i>All right, honey.<br />Feel better.</i>
