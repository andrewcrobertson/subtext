162440 164400 It's the sense of touch.
166120 167120 What?
169200 172880 Any real city, you walk,<br />you know?
173040 176680 You brush past people.<br />People bump into you.
176800 179640 In L.A., nobody touches you.
182320 185400 We're always behind<br />this metal and glass.
186840 189600 I think we miss<br />that touch so much
189720 193520 that we crash into each other<br />just so we can feel something.
195440 197520 You guys okay?
197680 200520 I think he hit his head.
200680 202400 You don't think that's true?
202520 204320 Stay in your car.
204440 207080 Graham, I think<br />we got rear-ended.
207240 209160 I think we spun around twice.
209320 214040 And somewhere in there, one of us lost<br />our frame of reference.
214160 216440 And I'm gonna<br />go look for it.
218440 221080 - Calm down, ma'am.<br />- I am calm!
221200 223040 I need to see your registration<br />and insurance.
223160 225040 Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!
225200 226760 - She do this!<br />- My fault?
226920 228840 Ma'am, you really need<br />to wait in your vehicle.
229000 230760 - My fault?<br />- Stop in middle of street!
230920 232480 Mexicans no know how to drive.
232600 237080 - She "blake" too fast.<br />- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.
237200 240720 - I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.<br />- Ma'am.
240880 243520 See, I stop when I see a long line of cars<br />stopped in front of me.
243640 246320 Maybe you see over<br />steering wheel, you "blake" too!
246480 249800 - Ma'am!<br />- I call immigration. Look what you do my car.
249960 251560 Officer, can you please<br />write in your report
251680 253520 how shocked I am to be hit<br />by an Asian driver!
253680 256680 - Ma'am!<br />- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...
261360 264560 All right. You've got<br />to calm down.
271920 275840 - Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.<br />- Fuck you.
278840 282920 - Hey, you okay?<br />- I'm freezin'.
283080 285680 Shit. I heard<br />it might snow.
285840 288080 - Get outta here.<br />- That's what I heard.
288200 290800 - You got a smoke?<br />- Nah. I quit.
290960 293440 Yeah, me too.
293560 295920 - What do you got?<br />- Dead kid.
305200 306920 Hey, Bob.
347480 350120 You get one free box of ammunition.<br />What kind do you want?
362920 365240 Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad<br />on your own time.
365360 367840 What do you want?
370920 373520 - Are you making insult at me?<br />- Am I making insult "at" you?
373680 376800 - Is that the closest you can come to English?<br />- Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.
376920 379240 - Oh, God, here we go.<br />- I have right like you.
379360 381120 - I have right to buy gun.<br />- Not in my store, you don't!
381360 383360 - Andy, get him outta here now!<br />- Go wait in the car.
383480 384400 Now. Get out!
385680 388920 - You're an ignorant man!<br />- I'm ignorant? You're liberating my country
389040 391960 and I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts<br />and incinerating your friends?
392080 394960 - Get the fuck out!<br />- No, you get the fuck out!
395080 396640 No, don't touch me!<br />He cheat me!
396760 398560 - Andy, now!<br />- Let's go.
398680 400080 Okay.
403600 406360 You can give me the gun<br />or give me back the money.
406480 408680 And I am really hoping<br />for the money.
413960 416400 - What kind of ammunition do you want?<br />- Whatever fits.
416560 418400 We got a lot of kinds.
418520 420760 We got long colts,<br />short colts, bull heads,
420880 423320 flat nose, hollowpoints,<br />wide cutters,
423440 426720 and a dozen more that'll fit<br />any size hole.
426840 430440 Just depends upon how<br />much bang you can handle.
432320 434440 I'll take the ones<br />in the red box.
437520 440040 - You know what those are?<br />- Can I have them?
449040 453320 Did you see any white people waitin' an hour<br />and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?
453440 455280 And how many cups of coffee<br />did we get?
455400 458120 You don't drink coffee!<br />And I didn't want any.
458240 461800 Man, that woman poured cup after cup<br />to every single white person around us.
461960 464840 But did she even ask you<br />if you wanted any?
465000 466840 We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want<br />and I didn't order,
466960 469080 and that's evidence<br />of racial discrimination?
469200 471120 Did you notice<br />that our waitress was black?
471240 473560 And black women don't think<br />in stereotypes?
473680 475560 You tell me. When was<br />the last time you met one
475680 477920 who didn't think she knew<br />everything about your lazy ass
478040 480160 before you even opened<br />your mouth, huh?
480280 482480 That waitress sized us up<br />in two seconds.
482640 486120 We're black, and black people don't tip.<br />She wasn't gonna waste her time.
486280 489120 Somebody like that? Nothing you can do<br />to change their mind.
489240 491560 How much did you leave?
491680 493520 You expect me to pay<br />for that kind of service?
493680 497840 What? What the fuck<br />is you laughin' at, man?
498000 500800 I'm seriously starting to think that<br />you're jealous of Karen.
500920 504920 Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through<br />a meal without calling her or anyone else.
505040 509360 Okay, no more phone calls. As a matter of fact,<br />you can hold the battery.
509520 511240 Okay?
512680 514880 Ten bucks says<br />she calls you in the car.
515000 517560 Wait, wait, wait.<br />See what that woman just did?
517680 519640 - You see that?<br />- She's cold.
519760 522920 She got colder<br />as soon as she saw us.
523080 526000 - Ah, come on, don't start.<br />- Man, look around you, man.
526160 529440 You couldn't find a whiter, safer or better-lit<br />part of this city right now.
529560 531360 But yet this white woman<br />sees two black guys
531520 534040 who look like UCLA students<br />strolling down the sidewalk,
534160 536480 and her reaction<br />is blind fear?
536600 538960 Look at us, dog. Are we dressed<br />like gangbangers?
539120 542280 Huh? No.<br />Do we look threatening? No.
542400 546120 Fact. If anybody should be<br />scared around here, it's us!
546280 550000 We're the only two black faces surrounded<br />by a sea of over-caffeinated white people
550160 552680 patrolled by<br />the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.
552880 556200 So you tell me.<br />Why aren't we scared?
556400 558440 'Cause we got guns?
558600 560240 You could be right.
563280 565320 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- Gimme the keys!
565520 568040 - Hurry up! Get down!<br />- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
568240 572200 - No, no! Please!<br />- Don't look at me! Turn around!
572400 575680 - Come on! Go!<br />- We're fine! Just keep moving!
580720 584960 No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing<br />off of there right now.
585120 587240 I know you just didn't call<br />Saint Christopher voodoo.
587440 589160 Man's the patron saint<br />of travelers, dog.
589320 592000 You had a conversation<br />with God, huh? What did God say?
592160 596040 "Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery<br />suction rings on every dashboard you find"?
596240 597600 Why the hell do you do that?
597720 600400 Look at the way your crazy ass drive,<br />then ask me again.
607920 610280 Chevy pickup and Mercedes<br />driving north on Balboa.
610440 612960 Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes<br />gets pissed, pulls a gun.
613120 615640 Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup is a cop<br />coming off shift.
615800 617640 This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
617760 620000 Yeah. Name's Conklin.<br />He's a narc out of Wilshire.
620120 622600 I got the Mercedes.
622800 626200 Mercedes takes a shot at him.<br />Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.
626360 629720 Mercedes rolls to a stop.<br />Driver opens the door, falls out dead.
629880 632520 He looks very relaxed<br />for just having shot somebody.
632680 634400 He says he kept tryin'<br />to drive away.
634560 636520 The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,<br />screaming, waving a gun.
636720 639080 Shot back in self-defense.
639240 643200 - Anybody actually see who shot first?<br />- They just heard two bangs.
643360 645040 Find me a witness.
658720 661320 That is a nice gun.
661480 665800 The car's registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
665960 667720 And that's not Cindy.
667840 670440 That is a William Lewis.
670640 673440 Found under the front seat.<br />Hollywood Division.
677760 681520 Looks like Detective Conklin<br />shot himself the wrong nigger.
692680 695600 - How much longer are you gonna be?<br />- This is the last one.
695760 697560 Thank you.
706000 708200 You don't think reporters<br />listen to police calls?
708360 710040 I need to talk to you<br />for a second.
711880 714200 You just give me a minute,<br />all right?
714360 717680 - Find Flanagan, will you? Now.<br />- Yes, sir.
718760 719640 Yes, honey?
719760 721640 I want the locks changed<br />again in the morning.
721760 722640 You want...
722800 725280 Why don't you just go lie down?<br />Have you checked on James?
725440 728520 Of course. I've checked on him every five<br />minutes since we've been home.
728680 732400 Do not patronize me. I want the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
733080 735600 It's okay. Just go to bed.
735760 739080 You know, didn't I just ask you<br />not to treat me like a child?
739240 741320 I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
741480 742800 Is okay I go home now?
742960 745600 It's fine. Thank you<br />very much for staying.
745720 747640 - You're welcome, no problem. Good night.<br />- Good night.
747800 749200 We'll see you tomorrow.
749320 753200 I would like the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
753360 755560 And you might mention<br />that we'd appreciate it
755680 757720 if next time they didn't send<br />a gang member.
757880 760040 - A gang member? You mean that kid in there?<br />- Yes, yes.
760200 763720 Yes. The guy with the shaved head,<br />the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.
763840 766160 - Those are not prison tattoos.<br />- Oh, really? And he's not gonna sell our key
766280 768680 to one of his gangbanger friends<br />the moment he is out our door?
768880 769680 We've had a tough night.
769840 773320 - It'd be best if you went...<br />- And wait for them to break in?
773440 776720 I just had a gun<br />pointed in my face.
776880 777880 You lower your voice!
778040 780640 And it was my fault<br />because I knew it was gonna happen.
780760 783120 But if a white person sees two black men<br />walking towards her,
783280 786600 and she turns and walks in the other direction,<br />she's a racist, right?
786800 789200 Well, I got scared<br />and I didn't say anything.
789360 791520 And ten seconds later<br />I had a gun in my face!
791640 795640 I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna<br />sell our key to one of his homies.
795760 800040 And this time it'd be really fucking great<br />if you acted like you actually gave a shit!
826440 829000 All right, what have we got?<br />Talk to me, Karen.
829120 830960 Flanagan doesn't think<br />anybody has the story yet.
831120 833320 I'm the goddamn District Attorney<br />of Los Angeles.
833480 836520 If my car gets jacked,<br />it's gonna make news.
836640 838320 Fuck!
839520 841640 Why did these guys<br />have to be black?
841800 845040 I mean, why?<br />No matter how we spin this,
845200 848040 I'm either gonna lose the black vote<br />or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
848240 853160 You're worrying too much. You have<br />a lot of support in the black community.
853280 855680 All right. If we can't duck this thing,<br />we're gonna have to neutralize it.
855840 860200 What we need is a picture of me<br />pinning a medal on a black man.
860320 862160 Bruce?
863320 864880 The firefighter.
865040 867800 The one who saved the camp or something.<br />Northridge. What's his name?
867920 869840 He's Iraqi.
870000 873000 He's Iraqi?<br />Well, he looks black.
873120 876720 He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.<br />His name's Saddam Khahum.
876880 879680 Saddam?<br />His-His name's Saddam?
879840 883760 That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal<br />on an Iraqi named Saddam.
883920 885960 Give yourself a raise!
888880 892160 It's been good<br />doing business with you.
892320 895520 - How soon can I have them?<br />- I'm picking them up right now.
895640 899080 Look, you're not listening to me.<br />This is an emergency.
899240 901960 I keep telling you he's in pain.<br />He can't sleep.
902080 905800 Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic<br />three times in the last month.
905920 910960 He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.<br />That is by no means an emergency.
911120 914280 If you have any more questions<br />about your HMO plan,
914440 918560 make an appointment to come in between<br />10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.
918680 920640 What does my father do<br />about sleeping tonight?
920760 922520 I don't know.<br />I'm not a doctor.
922640 925400 - I wanna talk to your supervisor.<br />- I am my supervisor!
925520 927240 - What is your name?<br />- Shaniqua Johnson.
927360 929920 Shaniqua.<br />Big fucking surprise that is.
945560 947800 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.
947920 950480 Vehicle is described as a black,<br />late-model Lincoln Navigator.
950640 954920 California plates,<br />4 Peter Charles Ida 315.
955080 958320 Suspects are two black males,<br />approximately 20 years of age.
966520 970400 That's not it. That's not the vehicle, John.<br />The plates don't match.
970520 975040 The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car<br />and takes it to Studio City.
979040 981280 They were doin' something!
1023720 1025040 Enthusiastic.
1026200 1028240 Keep your hands<br />where I can see 'em, please.
1028400 1032400 I'm gonna need to see your driver's license<br />and registration.
1032560 1034600 No problem.
1034720 1038440 I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove<br />compartment to get the registration.
1038640 1042240 - Is that okay?<br />- Nice and slow, please.
1046240 1048360 How are you tonight, Officer?
1048480 1050240 Excellent.
1052080 1054320 Here you go.
1056840 1058760 Stay inside the vehicle, please.
1067800 1070440 Let's do it again right now.
1070600 1072520 Step outta the car, please, sir.
1072640 1076160 Wait a minute, Officer.<br />I haven't been drinking or anything.
1076280 1078400 Then we shouldn't have<br />a problem.
1078520 1081040 He doesn't drink.<br />He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.
1081200 1082920 No, it's okay.
1083040 1085440 It's fine.
1087760 1090960 Step onto the sidewalk, sir.
1092760 1094920 That's good. Right there.
1096680 1098800 Look at me.
1098960 1100760 I want you to stand<br />on your right foot.
1100880 1104840 Touch your nose with the index finger<br />of your left hand.
1109080 1111560 I told you he doesn't drink.
1111680 1114200 Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you<br />one time to stay in the vehicle.
1114320 1116760 - Ma'am?<br />- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.
1116880 1119040 Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell<br />do you think you're talking to?
1119160 1123240 Look, Officer, my wife<br />has had a couple of drinks...
1123400 1126200 Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on<br />top of your head and interlock your fingers.
1126320 1128040 Wait. We're only a block<br />away from our house.
1128160 1130360 Hands on your head.<br />Interlock your fingers.
1130480 1133480 - Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.<br />- I'm a television director.
1133600 1136200 Me and my wife were just coming home<br />from an awards show.
1136360 1138480 Take your hands off him.<br />He's done nothing wrong.
1138640 1140680 Put your hands on top<br />of your head, ma'am.
1140800 1142200 - Do what he says.<br />- Fuck you!
1142320 1146000 - Put your hands...<br />- And you keep your filthy hands off me!
1146160 1147720 You motherfucking pig!
1147840 1151160 - Just stop talking!<br />- That's quite a mouth you have.
1151280 1152960 Of course you know that.
1153080 1156680 Fuck you! That's what<br />this is all about, isn't it?
1156800 1159440 You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a<br />black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.
1159600 1161200 Will you just shut<br />your fucking mouth!
1161360 1164240 I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.
1164400 1166560 Put your legs open.
1168280 1172360 Do you have any guns or knives<br />or anything I might get stuck with?
1172480 1174680 I'm wearing a cocktail dress.<br />What do you think?
1174800 1177200 You'd be surprised<br />some of the places I've found weapons.
1177320 1178200 He's clean.
1179680 1182880 What do you think we should do about this,<br />Mr. Thayer?
1183000 1187360 My partner and I just witnessed your wife<br />performing fellatio on you
1187480 1189520 while you were operating<br />a motor vehicle.
1189680 1193560 That's reckless endangerment,<br />which incidentally is a felony.
1195520 1199880 We could charge your wife with lewd conduct<br />and performing a sexual act in public.
1202160 1204720 You say you're a block<br />from home.
1204880 1207040 We could use our discretion
1207160 1210080 and let you go with a warning,
1210200 1213480 or we could cuff you and put you<br />in the back of the car.
1215120 1217840 What do you think<br />we should do, sir?
1225040 1228120 Look, we're sorry, and
1228240 1233520 we would appreciate if you would<br />just let us go with a warning, please.
1238000 1240560 The man's apologizing, Tommy.
1240720 1243600 I think we can let him go. Don't you?
1246240 1247760 Yeah.
1247920 1249960 All right.
1251120 1253760 You can go.
1261680 1263840 You folks drive safe now, huh?
1296720 1298960 Let's go, Tommy.
1306800 1308600 It won't close.
1309760 1310800 I can do that.
1310960 1313480 Dad, you couldn't even<br />get it open.
1313600 1316360 Have respect for your father.<br />Give me the gun!
1316480 1319000 Here. Now you can shoot<br />anybody you want.
1319120 1321760 Dorri, that man<br />could've killed your mother.
1321880 1325200 You think I should let crazy people<br />do what they want to us?
1325360 1326760 Farhad, it won't close.
1330360 1333600 Dorri, you should be at work.
1344560 1346440 Who are you calling?
1346560 1349040 I'm gonna report their asses.<br />Sons of bitches.
1349200 1352960 You actually believe they're gonna take<br />anything you have to say seriously?
1353120 1357800 Do you have any idea how that felt? To have<br />that pig's hands all over me?
1357920 1360640 And you just stood there!
1360760 1362760 And then you apologized<br />to him?
1362880 1365640 What did you want me to do?<br />Get us both shot?
1365760 1369080 They were gonna shoot us<br />on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.
1369200 1372720 Well, maybe you would've been satisfied<br />with just being arrested.
1372880 1376520 Oh, I get it. Much better to let him<br />shove his hand up my crotch
1376680 1379320 than get your name<br />in the paper.
1379440 1381520 You finally got me<br />figured out, 'cause see,
1381680 1384360 that's exactly<br />what I was worried about.
1384480 1387320 Oh? You weren't afraid that all your good<br />friends at the studio
1387440 1391120 were gonna read about you in the morning<br />and realize he's actually black?
1392720 1394640 You need to calm down<br />right now.
1394800 1399400 What I need is a husband who will not just<br />stand there while I am being molested!
1399520 1402320 They were cops for God sakes!<br />They had guns!
1403960 1406560 Maybe I should've let them<br />arrest your ass.
1406680 1410280 Sooner or later you gotta find out<br />what it is really like to be black.
1410400 1413000 Fuck you, man.<br />Like you know.
1413120 1416640 The closest you ever came to being black,<br />Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.
1416760 1419720 At least I wasn't watching it with<br />the rest of the equestrian team.
1419840 1421880 You're right, Cameron.<br />I got a lot to learn
1422000 1424960 'cause I haven't quite learned<br />how to shuck and jive.
1425080 1427800 Let me hear it again.<br />Thank you, mister policeman.
1427920 1430520 You sure is mighty kind<br />to us poor black folk.
1430640 1434960 You be sure to let me know next time<br />you wanna finger-fuck my wife.
1436480 1439280 How the fuck do you say<br />something like that to me?
1440480 1442880 You know, fuck you!
1443920 1447040 That's good. A little anger.<br />It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!
1494840 1495800 How's it goin'?
1495920 1497640 Okay.
1497680 1499720 You didn't get scared<br />or something, did you?
1499840 1502480 There's no monsters in the closet, right?<br />'Cause I hate monsters.
1502640 1505440 There's no such thing<br />as monsters.
1505560 1509000 - Ah, that's a good thing.<br />- I heard a bang.
1509120 1510600 Like a truck bang?
1510760 1512720 Like a gun.
1519720 1523360 That's funny, 'cause we moved<br />outta that bad neighborhood.
1523480 1527400 And there's not<br />too many guns around here.
1527520 1529760 How far can bullets go?
1529880 1531760 They go pretty far.
1531880 1534600 But they usually get stuck<br />in something and stop.
1534760 1536200 What if they don't?
1536360 1539920 You thinking about that bullet that came<br />through your window?
1543200 1545120 'Cause we never<br />did find it, did we?
1545240 1548600 I think it didn't see me<br />'cause I was under the covers.
1548720 1553480 Hmm. You think it was that same<br />bullet that you heard tonight?
1556600 1558640 You think<br />we should move again?
1558800 1559680 I like it here.
1559800 1563600 Me too. But if that bullet found out<br />where we lived...
1563720 1564640 Oh, hold on.
1564760 1566160 What?
1566320 1568280 So stupid!<br />How can I forget this?
1568400 1570560 What?
1571960 1574040 Nah. Forget it.<br />You ain't gonna believe me.
1574160 1576560 Tell me.
1576680 1578960 Okay.
1579120 1581800 When I was five, this fairy<br />came into my room one night.
1581960 1585160 - Right.<br />- I told you, you weren't gonna believe me.
1585280 1587640 - Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.<br />- No, tell me.
1589720 1591880 Okay.
1592000 1597000 So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,<br />"Yeah, right, you're a fairy."
1597160 1599040 Anyway, we're talking, you know.
1599200 1602120 And she's flying all around the room,<br />knocking down all my posters and stuff.
1602280 1604520 She was flying?
1604640 1607120 She had these little stubby wings.<br />She could've glued 'em on, you know?
1607280 1609760 Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.
1609880 1611760 So she said, "I'll prove it."
1611880 1614320 So she reaches<br />into her backpack.
1614480 1616680 And she pulls out<br />this invisible cloak.
1616800 1621160 She ties it around my neck,<br />and she tells me that it's impenetrable.
1621320 1623400 You know what<br />impenetrable means?
1623560 1625320 It means that nothing<br />can go through it.
1625440 1627560 No bullets. Nothing.
1627720 1631320 She told me that if I wore it,<br />nothing would hurt me.
1631440 1636200 So I did. And my whole life,<br />I never got shot, stabbed.
1636320 1639120 Nothing.<br />I mean, how weird is that?
1639280 1643000 Only she told me that I was supposed to give it<br />to my daughter on her fifth birthday.
1643120 1644800 And I forgot.
1644920 1646320 Can I touch it?
1646480 1648400 Sure, go ahead.
1650720 1653600 - I don't feel it.<br />- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?
1653720 1657400 I can take it off and tie it around your<br />shoulders. She told me how to do it.
1657520 1661000 - Unless you think it's stupid.<br />- Don't you need it?
1661120 1663760 No, not anymore.
1663920 1666680 So what do you think?<br />You want it?
1672720 1674440 Okay, let's get outta here.
1680080 1682080 Okay.
1694360 1696800 Put your head up.
1701640 1704120 Okay. Is that too tight?
1704280 1706640 Do you feel anything at all?
1706800 1709000 Good. Then<br />it's just right.
1715120 1717440 Do I take it off<br />when I have a bath?
1717600 1720200 No, you leave it on<br />all the time.
1720360 1725440 Until you have a daughter when she turns five,<br />then you give it to her.
1725600 1727560 Okay?
1727760 1730800 Okay.
1730960 1734240 Okay.<br />Good night, sweetie.
1735440 1737000 Good night.
1775480 1778760 Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music<br />of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.
1778880 1782680 How in the lunacy of your mind is hip-hop<br />music of the oppressor?
1782840 1785920 Listen to it, man!<br />"Nigger this, nigger that."
1786080 1789320 You think white people go around calling<br />each other honkies all day, man?
1789480 1790880 "Hey, honky, how's business?"
1791040 1792840 "Going great, cracker.<br />We're diversifying."
1792960 1797600 How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?<br />Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.
1797720 1799400 And you think there's<br />a difference, don't you? Huh?
1799560 1803400 Gonna buy me a rope<br />and lynch me a nigger
1803600 1806560 You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop<br />music comes from, do you?
1806720 1809080 I'd shoot 'em dead first<br />but I done broke my trigger
1809240 1811360 See, back in the '60s we had<br />smart, articulate black men.
1811520 1813520 Gonna get out my sheet<br />Put my hood on my head
1813680 1816560 Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,<br />Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.
1816720 1817960 Gonna string 'em up good
1818120 1819760 These brothers were speaking out good,<br />and people were listening!
1819920 1821480 Then they'll be dead
1821680 1823520 Then the FBI said,<br />"No, we can't have that."
1823680 1826240 Home of the brave<br />and the land of the free
1826400 1828360 "Let's give the niggers this music<br />by a bunch of mumbling idiots
1828560 1831160 and sooner or later,<br />they'll all copy it, and nobody
1831320 1833160 will be able to understand<br />a fucking word they say.
1833280 1834400 End of problem."
1841200 1843240 What the fuck<br />was that, dog?
1857160 1859240 - Holy shit!<br />- What?
1859400 1861720 Man, we done ran over<br />a Chinaman.
1861840 1863560 You're sayin' there's a Chinaman<br />under this truck?
1863720 1864760 What part don't you understand?
1864920 1867600 There's a Chinaman stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck.
1870000 1873560 - Help me.<br />- Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
1873680 1877160 Ah, God. What the hell did he do,<br />just leap out in front of the truck?
1877360 1880200 Man! This is so<br />completely fucked up.
1880360 1882120 Oh, really? No shit!
1882240 1885120 Okay, hold up.<br />Hold up, hold up, hold up.
1885280 1887120 - Get back in the truck.<br />- What?
1887280 1889320 - Yes, get back in the truck.<br />- You think we didn't drag him far enough?
1889480 1892200 No, we gonna drive away.<br />And he gonna let go.
1892360 1893880 He's not gonna let go, Anthony.
1894040 1896960 You know why? Because he's stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck!
1897120 1902120 Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've<br />considered that option half a block back.
1902240 1905560 What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms<br />and pull him from underneath.
1905720 1907200 You grab his arm,<br />it's gonna fall off.
1907360 1910000 Then you gonna be standing in the street<br />holding a Chinaman's arm.
1910160 1912720 Then what your ass<br />gonna do, huh?
1912880 1916240 If we leave this man here, he dies.<br />Then we're up for murder charges.
1916400 1920120 Just grab his arm.<br />We'll just pull him out.
1924800 1928200 I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.<br />I just want a new partner.
1928400 1930280 I understand.<br />Your partner's a racist prick.
1930480 1932760 But you don't wanna stir up<br />any bad feelings with him.
1932880 1934600 He's been on the force<br />for a long time.
1934720 1936760 Seventeen years.
1936880 1939000 And I do have<br />to work here, sir.
1939120 1941400 So you don't mind that there's<br />a racist prick on the force.
1941520 1944360 You just don't want him<br />to ride in your car.
1944480 1947120 If you need me to go on record<br />about this, sir, I will.
1947280 1949000 That'd be great.<br />Write a full report.
1949120 1951720 Because I'm anxious to<br />understand how an obvious bigot
1951880 1954640 could've gone undetected<br />in this department for 17 years.
1954800 1956800 Eleven of which he was under<br />my personal supervision.
1956960 1959240 Which doesn't speak very highly<br />of my managerial skills.
1959360 1962920 But that's not your concern.<br />I can't wait to read it.
1963080 1966760 What if I said I wanted a new partner<br />for personal reasons?
1966920 1970000 So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,<br />you just don't like him.
1970160 1972920 - Yes, sir.<br />- That's not a good enough reason.
1973040 1975800 Then I guess I should think of a better one<br />and get back to you.
1975920 1978640 So you think I'm asking you<br />to make one up.
1978800 1983320 Uh, no, sir. I just can't<br />think of one... right now.
1983440 1985400 You wanna know what I heard?
1986840 1988760 I heard it was a case<br />of uncontrollable flatulence.
1988920 1991000 You want me to say<br />he has flatulence?
1991120 1993760 Not him. You. You have<br />uncontrollable flatulence.
1993880 1997360 You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody<br />else so you're requesting a one-man car.
1997520 2000000 I'm not... comfortable with that,<br />Lieutenant.
2000120 2002920 I wouldn't be either. Which is why I understand<br />your need for privacy.
2003040 2006600 Just like I'm sure you understand how hard<br />a black man has to work to get to,
2006760 2009760 say, where I am, in a racist fucking<br />organization like the L.A.P.D.
2009880 2012680 And how easily<br />that can be taken away.
2012880 2015840 Now, that being said,<br />it's your decision.
2015960 2020560 You can put your career and mine on the line<br />in pursuit of a just cause,
2020720 2024400 or you can admit to having<br />an embarrassing problem
2024560 2026720 of a personal nature.
2030000 2031840 Fuck.
2060960 2063040 Excuse me.
2063160 2065640 Excuse me. Sir?
2065760 2067560 You finished?
2067720 2070680 I replaced the lock. But you got<br />a real problem with that door.
2070800 2073160 You fix the lock?
2073280 2077280 Nah, I replaced the lock.<br />But you gotta fix that door.
2077400 2080640 - Just fix the lock!<br />- Sir, listen to me.
2080760 2083720 What you need<br />is a new door.
2083840 2086240 - I need new door?<br />- Yeah.
2086400 2088720 Okay. How much?
2088880 2092520 I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call<br />somebody that sells doors.
2092680 2096600 You try to cheat me, right?<br />You have a friend that fix door?
2096720 2098760 Nah, I don't have a friend<br />that fix doors, bro.
2098880 2101080 Then go and fix<br />the fucking lock, you cheater.
2101200 2103840 You... You know what?
2103960 2107320 Why don't you just pay for the lock<br />and I won't charge you for the time.
2107440 2109720 You don't fix the lock!<br />I pay! You think I'm stupid?
2109840 2112800 You fix the fucking lock,<br />you cheater!
2112920 2115360 - I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.<br />- Then fix the fucking lock!
2115480 2118680 I replaced the lock!<br />You gotta fix the fucking door!
2118800 2121880 You cheat!<br />You fucking cheater!
2122000 2124600 - Fine. Don't pay.<br />- What?
2124720 2127320 - Have a good night.<br />- What? No. Wait!
2127440 2130280 Wait! You come back here!<br />You fix the lock!
2130400 2134080 Come here! You fix my lock!<br />Fix the fucking lock!
2140040 2143840 I understand. You run over a Chinaman.<br />Stuff him in the back.
2144000 2146720 Then bring the truck here<br />so I can share in the experience.
2146840 2149480 Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.<br />It'll wash right off.
2149600 2151840 - Georgie, burn this thing.<br />- Burn it?
2151960 2154080 It's a brand-new Navigator.<br />All you need is a little piece of carpet.
2154200 2156040 You watch the Discovery Channel?
2156160 2159400 - Not a lot.<br />- They got some good shit on that channel.
2159520 2162920 Every night there is a show with somebody<br />shining a blue light
2163080 2167080 and finding tiny specks of blood splattered<br />on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,
2167200 2171520 bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic<br />Burger King tray cups.
2171680 2174960 The next thing they show is some<br />stupid redneck in handcuffs
2175120 2179080 who looks absolutely stunned<br />that this is happening to him.
2179240 2182080 Sometimes the redneck is actually<br />watching the Discovery Channel
2182240 2184120 when they break in<br />to arrest him.
2184240 2189240 And he still can't figure out how on earth<br />they could've caught him!
2196920 2200640 Do I look like I wanna be<br />on the Discovery Channel?
2200760 2201960 No.
2202080 2204720 Then get the fuck<br />outta my shop.
2206880 2208920 Oh, yeah, make sure<br />you get that.
2209040 2212240 Without him, things could've gone really<br />fucking wrong tonight.
2214680 2217960 - Fuck!<br />- Don't! Don't you dare.
2218000 2219760 Don't.
2219920 2222840 Graham Waters.
2222960 2227040 No. No, he's not here, Mom.
2228440 2231280 I'm not gonna go<br />looking for him.
2231440 2234560 Look, he'll be home when...<br />Just leave it alone.
2234680 2239120 Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?<br />I'm having sex with a white woman.
2239280 2241560 Okay, where were we?
2241680 2244040 I was white, and you were<br />about to jerk off in the shower.
2244160 2246880 Oh, shit!
2247000 2249000 Come on.
2249160 2253880 I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't<br />think it would've pissed her off as much.
2254000 2256160 Why do you keep everybody<br />at a certain distance, huh?
2256280 2259840 - What, you start to feel something and panic?<br />- Come on, Maria.
2259960 2263280 You're just pissed<br />'cause I answered the phone.
2263400 2265560 That's just where<br />I begin to get pissed.
2265680 2268920 I mean, really, what kind of man<br />speaks to his mother that way?
2269040 2272920 Oh, this is about my mother.<br />What do you know about my mother?
2273040 2275760 If I was your father,<br />I'd kick your fucking ass.
2277200 2279120 Okay. I was raised badly.
2279240 2282480 Why don't you take your clothes off,<br />get back into bed and teach me a lesson?
2282640 2286400 You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.<br />How 'bout a geography lesson?
2286520 2290440 My father's from Puerto Rico.<br />My mother's from El Salvador.
2290600 2293480 Neither one of those is Mexico.
2293640 2295920 Ah. Then I guess<br />the big mystery is
2296080 2299360 who gathered all those remarkably<br />different cultures together
2299520 2302400 and taught them all how to park<br />their cars on their lawns?
2329040 2331280 Pop, you okay?
2331440 2334280 If I could piss, I'd be okay.
2335800 2338400 I'm... Jesus.
2338520 2340880 I'm done now.
2341040 2342920 Give me a hand.
2345320 2347200 Wait a goddamn minute!
2347320 2349840 - Wait a minute.<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2351760 2355080 All right. Okay. Okay.
2362160 2364680 Wait, wait, wait.<br />Stop, stop!
2364840 2367360 - I gotta go back.<br />- Okay.
2379240 2382080 What, are you gonna<br />stand there and stare at me?
2448280 2450760 - So Conklin just shot him?<br />- Mm-hmm.
2450920 2453680 - They know each other? It's a grudge thing?<br />- Sir.
2453840 2456320 Not as far as we can tell.
2456440 2458600 You think this is<br />racially motivated?
2458760 2461920 Well, a dozen people heard the shots.<br />Nobody saw anything.
2462040 2463880 - Who do we have on it?<br />- Graham Waters.
2464040 2467840 Waters. Tell him he speaks<br />to no one but me.
2467960 2470960 Call a press conference for 4:00,<br />and I want Waters here at 3:30.
2471120 2472880 And would someone<br />please find Flanagan.
2474880 2477960 Oh! What up, Mo Phat?
2478080 2482240 Man robs purses from old ladies and you,<br />"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"
2482360 2485240 That nigger will steal teeth<br />from a cripple, man.
2485360 2487760 You callin' him a thief?<br />And we do what?
2487920 2489760 The man steals<br />from black people.
2489880 2492080 Only reason black people<br />steal from their own
2492240 2494720 - is 'cause they terrified of white people.<br />- Man, please.
2494840 2498480 Think about it. Sherman Oaks.<br />Burbank. Santa Monica.
2498640 2501040 All scary-ass places<br />for a brother to find himself.
2501200 2503440 Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks<br />in Toluca Lake,
2503600 2507520 that nigger will run like a rabbit soon<br />as somebody say "decaf latte."
2507640 2510720 What the fuck did you do to my car?
2517880 2521080 Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.
2521200 2524040 I turn key to my car,<br />but nothing.
2524160 2525960 James wanted<br />to take this to school.
2526120 2528680 But I don't want the kids<br />to fight over it.
2528800 2532360 - Are these clean or dirty?<br />- All clean, senora!
2532520 2537200 You know, Maria, just once I would like to<br />wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.
2538520 2540960 Si, senora.<br />No problem.
2542000 2543360 I'm startin' to understand now.
2543480 2547080 By your work, you're settin'<br />an example for our neighborhood.
2547240 2549600 Sort of like a big brother<br />kind of thing, right?
2550800 2552000 Yeah, you laugh, man.
2552120 2556000 But you have never seen me steal<br />from a black person ever in your life.
2558000 2560360 What the hell do you think<br />you doin' right now, man?
2560480 2561720 Wavin' down the bus.
2561840 2564040 Put your hand down, dog!<br />Are you outta your mind?
2564160 2566400 You actually expect me<br />to get on a bus?
2566520 2568680 No. I was hopin' we could<br />push your car across town.
2568800 2570600 You know why? 'Cause we just<br />don't do stuff like that no more.
2570760 2573240 You have no idea, do you?
2573360 2576680 You have no idea why they put them great<br />big windows on the sides of buses, do you?
2576840 2579240 - Why?<br />- One reason only.
2579400 2583480 To humiliate the people of color<br />who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.
2583600 2584880 I didn't know that.
2585040 2587840 You could fill the Staples Center<br />with what you don't know.
2587960 2589800 You know the Kings<br />are playin' tonight.
2589960 2593160 You don't like hockey! The only reason<br />you say you do is to piss me off!
2593280 2595480 I love hockey.
2595600 2597120 Cut! Print. Moving on.
2597240 2601240 Okay, that takes us into scene 12.
2601360 2604320 Jamal, that's what<br />I'm talking about.
2604440 2607400 Right on.
2607560 2610760 - Cam, you got a second?<br />- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.
2610880 2613480 Yeah. Listen.<br />I think we need another take, buddy.
2613640 2616200 That looked pretty terrific, man.
2616360 2620320 This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal<br />seeing a speech coach or something?
2620440 2622280 What do you mean?
2622400 2625680 Have you noticed, uh...<br />This is weird for a white guy to say,
2625840 2629400 but have you noticed he's talking<br />a lot less black lately?
2631160 2632840 No, I haven't noticed that.
2632960 2636520 Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed<br />to say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."
2636680 2639040 And he changed it to,<br />"Don't talk to me about that."
2639200 2640440 Wait a minute.
2640560 2645080 You think because of that, the audience<br />won't recognize him as being a black man?
2645200 2648080 - Come on!<br />- Is there a problem, Cam?
2648240 2649720 Excuse me?
2649840 2652080 Is there a problem, Cam?
2656840 2659200 No, we don't have<br />a problem.
2659360 2662440 I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,<br />it's not his character.
2662600 2665040 Eddie's supposed to be<br />the smart one, not Jamal, right?
2665200 2668720 You're the expert here.<br />But to me, it rings false.
2671960 2675560 - We're gonna do it one more time.<br />- Thanks, buddy.
2675720 2679440 Everybody back to one, please.<br />Let's do it one more time.
2681920 2683880 Jamal, um...
2687280 2689480 Morning, Carol.<br />Who do I have?
2689640 2692280 Hold for a minute, please.<br />Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,
2692400 2695000 but you have a walk-in,<br />Mr. Ryan.
2698160 2700760 Send him in.
2700880 2703080 - Mr. Ryan.<br />- Yeah.
2703200 2705240 My name is Shaniqua Johnson.
2705360 2707800 I believe we spoke last night.
2707920 2711080 Oh, yeah. I wanted<br />to apologize about that.
2711200 2714240 I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.<br />My father's in a lot of pain.
2714360 2716760 Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.
2716880 2720840 This doctor he's been seein' says<br />he's got a urinary tract infection.
2721000 2724280 But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,<br />and he keeps gettin' worse.
2724400 2726320 And he's been back to see<br />Dr. Robertson?
2726440 2729000 Yeah. Between you and me,<br />the man's an idiot.
2729120 2730920 - Really?<br />- No offense.
2731080 2734400 But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.<br />I think his nurses are doing most of the work.
2734520 2739320 Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's<br />welcome to see a doctor outside the network.
2739440 2743640 And if this new doctor<br />says it's not an infection,
2743760 2746760 says it's his prostate and it needs to be<br />operated on, is that gonna be covered?
2746880 2750320 - Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...<br />- What good is that gonna do?
2750480 2753000 I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
2753120 2756480 All right.<br />You know what I can't do?
2756640 2759080 I can't look at you without<br />thinking about the five or six
2759240 2761480 more qualified white men<br />who didn't get your job.
2761640 2763240 It's time for you to go.
2763400 2766320 I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping<br />that I'm wrong about you.
2766480 2768160 I'm hoping that someone like yourself,
2768280 2770240 someone who may have<br />been given a helping hand,
2770360 2773000 might have a little compassion<br />for someone in a similar situation.
2773160 2775200 Carol, I need security<br />in my office!
2775320 2778240 You don't like me,<br />that's fine. I'm a prick.
2778400 2780800 My father doesn't deserve<br />to suffer like this.
2780960 2782800 He was a janitor.<br />He struggled his whole life.
2782960 2784680 Saved enough to start<br />his own company.
2784800 2786640 Twenty-three employees,<br />all of them black.
2786800 2789320 Paid 'em equal wages when<br />no one else was doing that.
2789480 2794240 For 30 years he worked side by side with<br />those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.
2794360 2796040 Then the city council decides
2796160 2799240 to give minority-owned companies<br />preference in city contracts.
2799360 2801960 And overnight,<br />my father loses everything.
2802120 2805320 His business, his home,<br />his wife. Everything!
2805480 2809000 Not once does he blame<br />your people.
2809120 2812400 I'm not asking you<br />to help me.
2812560 2816680 I'm asking that you do this small thing<br />for a man who lost everything
2816800 2819000 so people like yourself<br />could reap the benefits.
2819160 2821320 And do you know<br />what it's gonna cost you?
2821440 2823240 Nothing.
2823440 2825280 Just a flick of your pen.
2826840 2829640 Your father sounds like<br />a good man.
2829760 2833640 And if he'd come in here today, I probably<br />would've approved this request.
2833800 2838040 But he didn't come in. You did.<br />And for his sake, it's a real shame.
2838200 2840920 - Get him the hell outta my office.<br />- Prick.
2847800 2852200 Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you<br />you needed to replace or repair the door.
2852400 2853760 He say he fix the lock.
2853920 2856480 - You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!<br />- You're yelling again.
2856640 2858400 I am not yelling!<br />I'm upset!
2858560 2860760 Yes... Yes, I am.
2860920 2862400 Mom, are you all right?
2862600 2866600 Stop washing.<br />Insurance must take picture.
2866800 2869360 Okay?
2869520 2871720 Look what they wrote.
2871920 2873800 They think we're Arab.
2873960 2875840 When did Persian<br />become Arab?
2876000 2878640 I want his name. Yes.
2878800 2880320 Oh, my God.
2880480 2883320 - I want his name! Give me his name!<br />- Dad?
2883480 2884800 I'm not giving you<br />his name, sir.
2884920 2888480 - Dad, did they take the gun?<br />- Not fix my lock! I want his name!
2888640 2890560 I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
2890720 2894240 Don't hang up! Shit!
2894400 2896080 Oh, thank God.
2940240 2943000 Mom?
2943120 2945200 Mom, it's cold.<br />Come on.
2966600 2968720 Did you find your brother?
2970840 2972800 No, Mom.
2982000 2984360 I was doin' good.
2984520 2988920 I was... I was doin' real good.
2990720 2994280 - I know, Mom.<br />- I was doin'...
2997680 2999520 It's okay.
3010520 3012520 Did you find your brother?
3014800 3017040 No, Mom.
3018360 3020720 Tell him to come home.
3022160 3027240 Tell him I'm not mad, okay?<br />Okay, baby?
3027360 3029720 Okay, Mom.
3029880 3032200 Okay, baby.
3032400 3033840 Okay.
3034920 3036800 Okay.
3071040 3073800 - Did you apologize to your mother?<br />- She wasn't there.
3075760 3079160 Internal Affairs called. Found something<br />in the Mercedes.
3081880 3085200 That's lunch. One hour.
3112000 3114000 I tried to call.
3114160 3118400 - Sounded like you're havin' a bad day, huh?<br />- Yeah.
3121680 3124200 What?
3124360 3126120 I got scared, Cam.
3126280 3131440 It's not like I haven't been pulled over before.<br />You know?
3131600 3133480 But not like that.
3134800 3136680 And, yes,<br />I was a little drunk.
3136840 3140560 And I was mouthing off.
3140720 3142760 I'm sorry.
3144840 3146480 But when that man was putting<br />his hands on me...
3146640 3148160 I don't wanna talk about it.
3148280 3151560 I can't believe<br />you let him do that, baby.
3151680 3156280 Look, I know what you did<br />was the right thing. Okay?
3157800 3160360 But I was humiliated!
3160480 3162520 For you.
3162640 3166960 I just couldn't stand to see that man<br />take away your dignity.
3167120 3169920 Yeah. That's what happened.
3170080 3172920 - Oh, baby, don't do this.<br />- No. No, you're right.
3173080 3174760 I ain't doin' it.
3174880 3177240 You gonna walk away<br />from me?
3177400 3180520 - Cameron!<br />- Just go home.
3186600 3190120 Mm-hmm. I understand.
3191880 3193760 Thanks.
3196320 3199560 - Has your father read his policy?<br />- He doesn't read English.
3203280 3205400 Mr. Golzari, you said<br />you called the locksmith?
3206920 3208320 Yes. I tell him, fix it.
3208480 3211960 They said their man told you
3213080 3215240 to fix the door,<br />and you didn't do so.
3217200 3219360 Are you saying it's his fault?
3220400 3224560 Insurance company is calling it negligence.<br />They're not covering this.
3233080 3236960 No. This store is all we have.
3253400 3255360 I really am sorry.
3277000 3279040 What time<br />you must go to work?
3279160 3281920 Not until tonight.
3282040 3283400 Go home and sleep.
3286600 3289080 It's okay. It's okay.<br />Go home and sleep.
3311400 3312440 Hey.
3314160 3317360 Maybe they didn't tell you,<br />but I've been reassigned.
3317520 3319560 Yeah, they told me.
3319720 3322360 I just wanted to say,<br />good luck
3322480 3324200 and it was good<br />ridin' with you.
3324360 3325920 You too.
3328840 3331920 Wait till you've been on the job<br />a few more years.
3332040 3335080 - Yeah.<br />- Look at me, look at me.
3335240 3339640 Wait till you've been doin' it<br />a little longer.
3339760 3343520 You think you know<br />who you are, hmm?
3343640 3346320 You have no idea.
3349680 3352640 Yo, Gomez,<br />you ready to roll, homie?
3352760 3354480 Ready, amigo.
3363880 3366720 Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.
3366880 3371320 21-L-23, picking up strange noises<br />from your car.
3371440 3375080 21-L, is your mike open<br />by any chance?
3501200 3502960 Call it in.
3538960 3540640 Ma'am?
3540760 3542680 Can you hear me?
3542840 3545120 Paramedics are rolling.<br />They'll be here in two minutes.
3545240 3548160 - Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.<br />- Jesus.
3551720 3554960 Ma'am, are you hurt?
3555080 3558000 - Can you move?<br />- I... I can't breathe.
3560960 3563840 Okay, I'm gonna get you out.
3570360 3571760 It's okay.
3575880 3578240 Okay. Okay.
3578360 3580160 Okay, I'm gonna get<br />you out.
3584360 3586200 No!
3586360 3589240 - It's okay.<br />- Get away from me!
3589400 3592280 Get away.<br />Stay away from me!
3592440 3595520 Not you! Not you!
3595640 3598320 - It's okay.<br />- Don't touch me! Don't touch me!
3598440 3601840 - Keep away from me!<br />- Lady, I'm tryin'... I'm tryin' to help you.
3602000 3604400 Fuck you!<br />Not you!
3604520 3607320 Somebody!<br />Anybody else!
3607480 3610960 - Please, somebody! Not you!<br />- Stop moving!
3611080 3614400 No! Get your filthy<br />fucking hands off me!
3614520 3618520 Stop moving. Lady, I'm not<br />gonna fucking hurt you!
3623320 3625600 Okay. Okay.
3625720 3628120 Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.
3628280 3631880 I'm not gonna touch you.<br />But there's nobody else here yet
3632000 3633920 and that's gasoline there.
3635480 3638640 We need to get you<br />outta here right away. Okay?
3638760 3640840 Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
3640960 3646480 Okay. I need to reach across your lap.<br />Can I do that, please?
3649560 3651440 Yeah. Yeah.
3652800 3654360 Thanks.
3658200 3661800 Is anything broken?
3661920 3664240 I-I don't think so.
3664360 3667120 Okay. Then that's good.
3667240 3669640 Are you... Are you<br />gonna get me out?
3669760 3672880 Yeah, I'm gonna get<br />you out. Okay?
3673000 3676160 Look at me. Look at me.<br />I'm gonna get you out.
3681360 3683520 Oh, fuck!
3683640 3686520 - I'm sorry.<br />- That's okay.
3688600 3691280 I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?
3691400 3693360 I'm gonna have to cut the belt.
3694360 3695880 It's okay, it's okay.
3696000 3698560 It's okay. Okay,<br />we're gonna get you out.
3698680 3700880 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />Look at me!
3701000 3703360 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />We're gonna get you outta here.
3703480 3705120 Everything's gonna be fine.
3722800 3723520 Ryan!
3757240 3759160 Pull!
3772560 3774480 It's okay.
3783600 3785760 It's okay.
3785880 3789360 All right.<br />It's okay, it's okay.
3789480 3791800 It's all right.<br />I got it. I got it.
3791960 3793880 Ma'am? Ma'am,<br />can you walk with me?
3794040 3796200 It's cool, it's cool.
3797560 3800440 Here we go. All right,<br />you're doin' great.
3830200 3833440 The D.A. Wanted me to apologize.<br />He really wanted to be here himself.
3833560 3836160 No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work none<br />of us would have jobs.
3836280 3838440 - Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.<br />- Graham Waters.
3838560 3841240 - Thanks for coming in.<br />- He just pulled into the garage.
3841400 3844360 Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,<br />so we'll make this short.
3844480 3847680 Internal Affairs says this Conklin has two<br />suspicious shootings on his record.
3847800 3850920 Both black men. Both times he was cleared,<br />but only just.
3851040 3853720 Detective Lewis<br />makes black man number three.
3853840 3857120 You know any reason why we shouldn't<br />hang Conklin for this?
3857240 3862120 Well, it's more complicated<br />than we originally thought.
3862240 3867840 We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car<br />that Detective Lewis was driving.
3867960 3870000 Shit!
3870120 3874400 Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him<br />to stay in the car until he hears from me.
3874520 3878200 You found the money in the Mercedes.<br />I thought that wasn't his car.
3878360 3882000 The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.<br />We haven't been able to get in touch with her.
3882120 3885440 Apparently she, uh,<br />left town this morning.
3885560 3889160 So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not<br />have known the money was in it.
3895320 3898800 You really think you're gonna<br />be able to make that fly?
3900000 3902920 Latasha Harlins,<br />Rodney King.
3903040 3905880 - These names ring a bell, Detective?<br />- Yeah, vaguely.
3906000 3911240 We have attorneys for this slain police officer<br />camping in our offices.
3911360 3913960 We have his mother<br />and a half dozen men of the cloth
3914080 3916840 who swear that Lewis was one of<br />the twelve apostles of Christ.
3916960 3918360 We have two black city councilmen
3918480 3921560 and a congresswoman<br />who call on the hour, every hour,
3921720 3924920 demanding to know what the district attorney<br />intends to do about this.
3925080 3927920 And you want him to walk<br />into that press room
3928080 3930960 and tell them all that<br />the situation is complicated?
3936000 3937400 Give us a minute.
3939000 3941040 No problem.
3948280 3950320 Who knows about the money?
3950480 3952400 You gotta be kiddin' me.
3952560 3956200 There are only two people<br />in this room.
3956320 3959480 Myself, my partner,<br />Ferguson and Internal Affairs.
3959640 3962000 - Jim Ferguson?<br />- Yeah.
3966440 3968720 Okay. I guess<br />I don't see a problem.
3968880 3971160 As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't clear<br />evidence of any wrongdoing.
3971320 3974160 And even if it was, we aren't going to<br />prosecute a dead man.
3974280 3978520 Which means the money Internal Affairs<br />is holding can't be considered evidence.
3978680 3980800 You can do this dance<br />if you want to,
3980960 3984240 but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report<br />comes back tomorrow
3984360 3987160 it's going to say that Detective Lewis<br />was coked out of his head.
3988600 3990000 Fucking black people, huh?
3990120 3992040 What did you just say?
3992200 3994040 I mean,
3994200 3996560 I know all the sociological<br />reasons why per capita
3996720 3999600 eight times more black men<br />are incarcerated than white men.
3999760 4003400 Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.<br />Bias in the judicial system.
4003560 4005400 All that stuff.<br />All that stuff!
4005560 4009360 But still, it's gotta get to you,<br />on a gut level as a black man.
4009560 4012320 They just can't keep their hands<br />out of the cookie jar.
4016880 4019280 Of course, you and I know<br />that's not the truth.
4019440 4021400 But that's the way<br />it always plays, doesn't it?
4021560 4024840 And assholes like Lewis keep feeding<br />the flames. It's gotta get to you.
4024960 4028240 What did you say<br />you did for the D.A. Again?
4028400 4030200 You coach ball down in Compton.<br />Am I right?
4030320 4032120 Oh, please, don't do that.
4032280 4034920 Don't act like you know<br />something about me, okay?
4035080 4038840 What do you think those kids need... to make<br />them believe, to give them hope?
4039000 4041400 You think they need another<br />drug-dealing cop
4041560 4044360 or do you think they need<br />a fallen black hero?
4044480 4048840 Why don't you cut through the bullshit<br />and just tell me what it is you want.
4050840 4053440 The D.A.'s squad loses<br />its lead investigator next month.
4053600 4057280 Rick is quite adamant that his replacement<br />be a person of color.
4057400 4061360 It's a high-profile position, and he wants<br />to send the right message to the community.
4061520 4064960 And the right message is,<br />"Look at this black boy I just bought?"
4065120 4069760 Well, fuck you very much.<br />But thanks for thinking of me.
4069880 4072240 Actually we were thinking of you.
4072360 4075360 Until we saw that.
4075520 4077440 It's your brother's file.
4077600 4080520 Twenty-something years old<br />and already three felonies.
4080680 4083240 Three strikes law. Kid's going away<br />for life for stealing a car.
4083400 4085880 Christ, that's a shitty law.
4086040 4087880 There's a warrant in there.
4088000 4092200 But still, hey, he had<br />every opportunity you had.
4093560 4096760 Fucking black people, huh?
4100920 4105160 So all, uh... all I need to do<br />to make this disappear
4105320 4107480 is to frame<br />a potentially innocent man?
4107640 4110760 What are you? The fucking defender<br />of all things white?
4110880 4114400 We're talking about a white man<br />who shot three black men.
4114560 4119040 And you're arguing with me that maybe<br />we're not being fair to him?
4119200 4122000 You know what? Maybe you're right.<br />Maybe Lewis did provoke this.
4122120 4124160 And maybe he got exactly<br />what was coming to him.
4124320 4127160 Or maybe stoned or not,<br />just being a black man in the Valley
4127320 4129480 was enough to get him killed.
4129600 4132840 There was no one there to see who shot first,<br />so there is no way to know.
4132960 4136880 Which means we<br />could get this wrong.
4138720 4141600 Maybe that's what happened<br />with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.
4141760 4145960 Maybe Lewis isn't the only one<br />who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
4146080 4148360 You're the one closest to all this.
4148480 4150360 You need to tell us.
4154080 4156400 What does your gut tell you?
4168640 4171680 So? Graham?
4171800 4173800 What do I tell 'em?
4173960 4177680 You tell me, and I'll tell them.
4184080 4188000 Well, I think given<br />Detective Conklin's history,
4188160 4191000 it's pretty clear<br />what happened last night.
4191160 4193680 Okay.
4209680 4211800 Before I get to why we're here,
4211960 4215680 I know that many of you have heard we had<br />our car stolen last night.
4215800 4219960 And as you could imagine, my wife and I<br />are both pretty shaken up.
4220120 4221840 But we're okay.
4221960 4226360 And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls<br />and your concern. Thank you.
4226520 4231800 Now, just after 9:00 p.m. Last night,<br />Detective William Lewis,
4231960 4234440 an eight-year veteran of the force and an<br />active member of the black community,
4234600 4238520 was gunned down<br />by a fellow officer.
4294080 4295800 Get outta the car!
4295960 4298280 Gimme the keys!<br />Get out... What the fuck?
4300240 4302120 Whoa! What the fuck<br />are you doing, man?
4302280 4304040 Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?
4304160 4306920 Say that again!
4307040 4309200 - Say that again!<br />- You stupid motherfucker!
4309320 4312440 Say it again, huh!<br />Call me a nigger again!
4312600 4314840 - Man, what the fuck? Get off!<br />- Fuck you!
4314960 4317560 - Shoot him!<br />- I'll blow your head off!
4317720 4320600 - Shoot this motherfucker!<br />- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!
4320760 4323080 Stop talkin' and shoot!
4323200 4325920 - Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.<br />- Get off of me!
4327960 4330600 Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!
4330720 4332600 - Oh, shit.<br />- Anthony! Anthony!
4334880 4336280 Get the fuck outta my car!
4336400 4338520 Shit! Damn!
4338680 4340720 - What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!<br />- Fuck you!
4344600 4348360 Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.<br />West bound.
4353760 4357880 2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...<br />Oh, Christ!
4363280 4365360 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- You get the fuck outta the car!
4365480 4367800 - Get outta the fucking car!<br />- It's my fucking car!
4367920 4370160 - It's my fucking gun!<br />- Fuck, it's my gun now!
4370280 4372360 Gimme my fucking gun!
4379360 4381080 Fuck!
4382760 4386520 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4389280 4393120 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4396280 4398720 Slowly step out<br />of the vehicle.
4398840 4402360 - Get out of my car.<br />- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.
4405360 4408960 Turn off the engine.<br />Throw the keys out the window.
4421120 4424360 You fucking want me?<br />Here I am, you pig fuck!
4424480 4425880 Lie face down on the ground.
4426000 4428320 - Spread your arms and legs.<br />- No, you lie face down!
4428440 4430520 Don't come any closer!<br />Down on your knees!
4430680 4432920 Fuck you! What are you gonna do?<br />Pull the fucking trigger!
4433080 4433960 On your knees now!
4434080 4436640 You get on your knees<br />and suck my fucking dick!
4436760 4439440 Do I look like<br />I'm fucking joking with you?
4439560 4441040 That's what you look like,<br />a fucking joke to me.
4441160 4443240 - This man is making threatening gestures.<br />- Threatening gestures?
4443360 4445560 You wanna see a threatening gesture?<br />I got a threatening gesture.
4445720 4449200 - I know this man! I know this man!<br />- Get back.
4449360 4451760 - Give me some space. I know this guy.<br />- Get outta the way.
4451880 4452920 Step away.
4453080 4454960 Give me some goddamn room.<br />I know this guy.
4456760 4459200 - Man, don't walk up on me!<br />- See what's happening here?
4459320 4461400 Do you wanna die here, huh?<br />Is that what you want?
4461560 4463360 'Cause these guys<br />really wanna shoot you.
4463480 4465960 And the way you're acting,<br />they'll be completely fucking justified.
4466080 4467160 Fuck you!
4467320 4470320 Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.<br />You're the one.
4470440 4472560 'Cause you're the one whose head's<br />gonna be blown off
4472680 4473960 - and onto that man's patio.<br />- Officer Hanson, step away.
4475000 4478120 He's a friend of mine, okay?<br />He's a fucking friend! This man is not armed!
4478240 4481000 He's not gonna shoot you, me,<br />or anybody else, all right?
4481120 4483120 So give me two goddamn seconds.<br />Can you do that?
4483240 4486360 Lower your firearm.<br />Lower your firearm!
4491320 4494400 You startin' to understand<br />the situation?
4494520 4497120 What do you want from me?
4497240 4501560 Unless you think your wife is better off with<br />a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,
4501720 4503480 I want you to sit on that curb,<br />put your hands on your head
4503640 4505720 and do nothing until I speak<br />with these officers.
4505880 4508680 I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'<br />my hands on my head for nobody.
4508800 4512640 Then stand where you are and keep your<br />hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?
4515640 4517640 Yeah, I can do that.
4517760 4519920 Good.
4520040 4523640 I told this man to stay where he is<br />and keep his hands in plain sight.
4523800 4528320 This man better be related to you by blood<br />because this is fucking nuts.
4528440 4530440 I need this favor.
4530560 4534400 You can check the guy's name, his license.<br />He's got no priors, no warrants.
4534520 4536960 I need to let him go<br />with a warning.
4537080 4541800 - What kind of fucking warning?<br />- A harsh warning.
4544280 4546040 Thank you.
4548760 4552640 You've been warned. Do you understand me?<br />Do you understand me!
4552760 4555880 You want something from me?<br />'Cause I'm right here.
4556000 4559880 - I'm trying to help you.<br />- I didn't ask for your help, did I?
4561960 4564040 Go home.
4567560 4569760 Yeah, that I can do.
4645080 4646880 Look at me.
4648320 4650840 You embarrass me.
4651000 4652960 You embarrass yourself.
4694200 4695600 Daddy's home!
4714440 4716360 - What's up?<br />- Give me my money!
4716480 4718800 - What? What money?<br />- Daddy!
4718920 4722040 - To pay for my store. Give me my money!<br />- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!
4722200 4723400 Give me my money!
4725040 4728040 - I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!<br />- That's not my truck!
4728160 4730360 - Daddy?<br />- Elizabeth!
4730520 4734560 Hey, you know what?<br />Hey, I got $50. Here.
4734680 4736880 Fifty dollars?<br />You took everything!
4737000 4740600 - Mommy?<br />- I'm coming, I'm coming!
4740760 4744800 - He doesn't have it.<br />- Hasn't got what?
4744920 4749920 I have it. He doesn't<br />have the impenetrable cloak!
4750320 4751880 Lara, stay outta the street!
4778120 4781640 - It's okay, Daddy.<br />- What... What?
4781760 4783160 I'll protect you.
4809320 4811880 It's okay. Daddy's okay.
4812240 4815080 It's a really good cloak.
4892760 4894400 How's it goin'?
4919160 4923920 I sent her out for groceries,<br />and that was two hours ago, Carol.
4924040 4925880 Well, you are one to talk.
4926000 4929680 You go through, like,<br />six housekeepers a year?
4929800 4932960 I'm not snapping at you!<br />I am angry.
4934200 4936160 Yes! At them! Yes!
4936280 4940440 At them, the police,<br />at Rick, at Maria,
4940560 4944080 at the dry cleaners<br />who destroyed another blouse today,
4944200 4947720 at the gardener who keeps<br />over-watering the lawn.
4947840 4948760 I...
4950400 4952800 I just thought that...
4952920 4956360 Carol, I just thought that<br />I would wake up today
4956480 4959320 and I would feel better,<br />you know?
4959440 4963240 But I was still mad.<br />And I realized...
4963360 4967080 I realized that it had nothing to do<br />with my car being stolen.
4969080 4972640 I wake up like this<br />every morning!
4972760 4976560 I am angry all the time,<br />and I don't know why.
4976680 4979840 Carol, I don't know why!<br />And I...
4981480 4984440 Yeah, yeah, call me back.
4984600 4986360 Bye.
5092960 5094680 Really appreciate this.
5094840 5096960 No problem.
5102640 5104360 So how long you been<br />out there tonight? It's cold.

5847480 5850360 It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.<br />It's just a bad sprain.
5850480 5852760 Carol was the only one<br />that was home and
5852880 5856360 she said she couldn't come get me<br />because she was getting a massage.
5856480 5858760 That's because she's a bitch.
5858880 5862640 She's been my friend for ten years.
5862760 5864520 All right, honey.<br />Feel better.
5864640 5866800 I'll be there soon.
