169583 171499 <i>It's the sense of touch.</i>
173250 174332 What?
176625 180665 <i>Any real city, you walk, you know?</i>
180666 183540 <i>You brush past people.<br />People bump into you.</i>
184666 186749 <i>In LA, nobody touches you.</i>
190250 193040 We're always behind this metal and glass.
195083 198249 I think we miss that touch so much
198250 201832 that we crash into each other<br />just so we can feel something.
203916 205374 You guys okay?
206333 208290 I think he hit his head.
209041 211165 <i>You don't think that's true?</i>
211333 213165 <i>Stay in your car.</i>
213333 216082 <i>Graham, I think we got rear-ended.</i>
216083 218499 <i>I think we spun around twice.</i>
218500 222165 And somewhere in there,<br />one of us lost our frame of reference.
223416 225540 And I'm gonna go look for it.
228250 230874 <i>- Calm down, ma'am.<br />- I am calm!</i>
230875 232957 I need to see your registration<br />and insurance.
232958 235249 Why? It's not my fault! It's her fault!
235250 237082 - She do this!<br />- My fault?
237083 239249 Ma'am, you really need to wait<br />in your vehicle.
239250 241249 - My fault?<br />- Stop in middle of street!
241250 242999 Mexicans no know how to drive.
243000 247707 <i>- She blake too fast.<br />- I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.</i>
247708 250749 - I'm sorry you no see my "blake" light.<br />- Ma'am.
250750 254540 See, I stop when I see a long line of cars<br />stopped in front of me.
254541 257415 Maybe you see over steering wheel,<br />you "blake" too!
257416 258665 - Ma'am!<br />- Crazy Mexican.
258666 260749 I call immigration on you.<br />Look what you do my car.
260750 262707 <i>Officer, can you please write down<br />in your report</i>
262708 264582 <i>how shocked I am to be hit<br />by an Asian driver.</i>
264583 267707 <i>- Ma'am!<br />- Ma'am, no. See, it's Detective...</i>
272416 275374 All right. You've got to calm down.
283750 287207 - Hey, Detective. Nice entrance.<br />- Fuck you.
290750 294915 - Hey, you okay?<br />- I'm freezing.
294916 298207 Shit. I heard it might snow.
298208 300582 - Get out of here.<br />- That's what I heard.
300583 303082 - You got a smoke?<br />- No. I quit.
303750 305207 Yeah, me, too.
306541 309040 - What do you got?<br />- Dead kid.
319083 320499 Hey, Bob.
362416 365207 You get one free box of ammunition.<br />What kind do you want?
378250 379790 Yo, Osama!
379791 382540 Plan a jihad on your own time.<br />What do you want?
387083 389874 - Are you making insult at me?<br />- Am I making insult "at" you?
389875 391374 Is that the closest<br />you can come to English?
391375 393415 Yes, I speak English!<br />I am American citizen.
393416 395582 - Oh, God, here we go.<br />- I have right like you.
395583 397790 - I have right to buy gun.<br />- Not in my store, you don't.
397791 400165 - Andy, get him out of here now!<br />- Dad, go wait in the car.
400166 401249 Now. Get out!
402250 403624 You're an ignorant man!
403625 405832 Oh, yeah, I'm ignorant?<br />You're liberating my country
405833 409124 and I'm flying 747s into your mud huts<br />and incinerating your friends?
409125 411165 - Get the fuck out of my store!<br />- No, you get the fuck!
411166 412415 - Now, come on.<br />- Get out!
412416 414082 No, don't touch me! He cheat me this man!
414083 415874 - Andy, now!<br />- Come on, let's go.
416583 417624 Okay.
421125 423874 You can give me the gun<br />or give me back the money.
423875 426415 And I am really hoping for the money.
431791 434415 - What kind of ammunition do you want?<br />- Whatever fits.
434416 436415 Oh, we got a lot of kinds.
436666 439082 We got long colts, short colts, ball heads,
439083 441707 flat nose, hollow points, wide cutters,
441708 444040 and a dozen more that'll fit any size hole.
445208 448707 Just depends upon<br />how much bang you can handle.
451875 454207 I'll take the ones in the red box.
456458 459249 - You know what those are?<br />- Can I have them?
468916 470540 Did you see any white people in there
470541 473415 waiting an hour and 32 minutes<br />for a plate of spaghetti, huh?
473416 475165 And how many cups of coffee did we get?
475166 477790 You don't drink coffee,<br />and I didn't want any.
477791 480124 Man, that woman in there<br />poured cup after cup
480125 481915 to every single white person around us,
481916 484540 but did she even ask you<br />if you wanted any?
484541 487124 We didn't get any coffee<br />that you didn't want and I didn't order,
487125 489582 and that's evidence<br />of racial discrimination?
489583 491540 Did you notice that our waitress was black?
491541 493999 And black women<br />don't think in stereotypes?
494000 495082 You tell me something, man.
495083 497874 When was the last time you met one<br />who didn't think she knew everything
497875 500999 about your little, lazy ass<br />before you even opened your mouth, huh?
501000 503040 That waitress sized us up in two seconds.
503041 506915 We're black, and black people don't tip.<br />So she wasn't gonna waste her time.
506916 510207 Now, somebody like that,<br />nothing you can do to change their mind.
510208 512624 Yeah, well, how much did you leave?
512625 515040 You expect me to pay<br />for that kind of service?
515500 516582 What?
516791 519374 What the fuck is you laughing at, man?
519375 522332 I'm seriously starting to think<br />that you're jealous of Karen.
522333 524707 Hardly. I'd just like to see you<br />get through a meal
524708 526582 without calling her<br />or anyone else for that matter.
526583 528415 Okay, look, no more phone calls tonight.
528416 531249 As a matter of fact,<br />here, you can hold the battery.
531250 532332 Okay?
534666 537165 $10 says she calls you in the car.
537166 539957 Wait, wait, wait.<br />You see what that woman just did?
539958 541999 - You see that?<br />- Why, she's cold.
542000 544790 She got colder<br />as soon as she saw us, dawg.
545250 548582 - Oh, man, come on, don't start.<br />- Man, look around you, man.
548583 552124 You couldn't find a whiter, safer<br />or better-lit part of this city right now.
552125 554290 But yet this white woman<br />sees two black guys
554291 557124 who look like UCLA students<br />strolling down the sidewalk,
557125 559374 and her reaction is blind fear?
559666 562249 I mean, look at us, dawg.<br />Are we dressed like gangbangers?
562250 565707 Huh? No. Do we look threatening? No.
565708 569707 Fact. If anybody<br />should be scared around here, it's us.
569708 573790 We're the only two black faces surrounded<br />by a sea of over-caffeinated white people
573791 576290 patrolled by the trigger-happy LAPD.
576291 579040 So you tell me. Why aren't we scared?
580291 581999 'Cause we got guns?
582375 584040 You could be right.
587208 589415 - Get the fuck out of the car!<br />- Give me the keys!
589416 591457 - Come on. Hurry up!<br />- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
591458 592582 Get down!
592583 594415 - No, no! Please!<br />- Don't look at me!
594416 597082 Motherfuck, I said don't look at me.<br />Turn around!
597083 600374 Move. Let's go, come on.<br />We're good. We're fine. Just keep moving.
605750 609832 No, no, no! Take that voodoo-ass thing<br />off of there right now.
609833 612415 I know you just didn't call<br />Saint Christopher voodoo.
612416 614540 Man's the patron saint of travelers, dawg.
614541 617249 You had a conversation with God, huh?<br />What did God say?
617250 618540 "Go forth, my son,
618541 622165 "and leave big slobbery suction rings<br />on every dashboard you find?"
622166 623540 Why the hell do you do that?
623541 626165 Look at the way your crazy ass drive,<br />then ask me again.
633666 636249 Chevy pickup and Mercedes<br />driving north on Balboa.
636250 639082 Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the<br />Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.
639083 641582 Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup<br />is a cop coming off shift.
641583 643874 Wait a minute,<br />this Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
643875 646624 Yeah. Name's Conklin.<br />He's a narc out of Wilshire.
646625 648207 I got the Mercedes.
649041 652749 Mercedes takes a shot at him.<br />Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.
652750 655874 Mercedes rolls to a stop.<br />Driver opens the door, falls out dead.
656875 659790 He looks very relaxed<br />for just having shot somebody.
659791 661499 He says he kept trying to drive away.
661500 664082 The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,<br />screaming, waving a gun.
664083 666040 Shot back in self-defense.
666541 670374 - Anybody actually see who shot first?<br />- They just heard two bangs.
671000 672665 Find me a witness.
686500 688874 That is a nice gun.
689500 693249 Well, the car's registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
694125 695874 And that's not Cindy.
696291 699415 That is a William Lewis.
699416 702415 Found it under the front seat.<br />Hollywood Division.
706583 710249 Looks like Detective Conklin shot himself<br />the wrong nigger.
721958 725207 - How much longer are you gonna be?<br />- This is the last one.
725208 726499 Thank you.
735708 738790 You don't think reporters<br />listen to police calls?
738791 740582 I need to talk to you for a second.
741750 744165 You just give me a minute, all right?
744583 747124 - And find Flanagan, will you? Now.<br />- Yes, sir.
749125 750290 Yes, honey?
750291 752249 I want the locks changed again<br />in the morning.
752250 753332 You want...
753333 756082 Look, why don't you just go lie down, huh?<br />Have you checked on James?
756083 757707 Well, of course I've checked on James.
757708 759624 I've checked on him every five minutes<br />since we've been home.
759625 761457 - Do not patronize me.<br />- I'm...
761458 764082 I want the locks changed again<br />in the morning.
764083 766957 It's okay. Just go to bed.
766958 770332 You know what, didn't I just ask you<br />not to treat me like a child?
770333 772124 I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
773541 774999 Is okay I go home now?
775000 776832 It's fine.<br />Thank you very much for staying, Maria.
776833 777999 You're welcome. No problem.
778000 779249 - Good night, Miss Jean.<br />- Good night.
779250 781040 We'll see you tomorrow.
781583 785415 I would like the locks changed again<br />in the morning.
785416 788165 And you know what?<br />You might mention that we'd appreciate it
788166 789999 if next time<br />they didn't send a gang member.
790000 791332 - A gang member?<br />- Yes, yes.
791333 792749 - What, you mean that kid in there?<br />- Yes.
792750 796082 The guy in there with the shaved head, the<br />pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.
796083 797207 Those are not prison tattoos.
797208 799082 Oh, really?<br />And he's not gonna go sell our key
799083 801332 to one of his gangbanger friends<br />the moment he is out our door?
801333 802665 We've had a really tough night.
802666 804874 I think it'd be best<br />if you just went upstairs right now...
804875 806457 And, what? Wait for them to break in?
806458 809582 I just had a gun pointed in my face.
809583 810874 You lower your voice!
810875 813749 And it was my fault<br />because I knew it was gonna happen.
813750 816749 But if a white person<br />sees two black men walking towards her,
816750 820249 and she turns and walks in the<br />other direction, she's a racist, right?
820250 822665 Well, I got scared and<br />I didn't say anything.
822666 825582 And ten seconds later<br />I had a gun in my face!
825583 826749 Now, I am telling you.
826750 829665 Your amigo in there is gonna sell our key<br />to one of his homies.
829666 834165 And this time it'd be really fucking great<br />if you acted like you actually gave a shit!
861791 863874 All right, what have we got?<br />Talk to me, Karen.
863875 865915 Flanagan doesn't think<br />anybody has the story yet.
865916 868624 I'm the goddamn District Attorney<br />of Los Angeles.
868625 871457 If my car gets jacked,<br />it's gonna make news.
872041 873124 Fuck!
875375 878457 Why did these guys have to be black?<br />I mean, why?
879208 880874 No matter how we spin this thing,
880875 883957 I'm either gonna lose the black vote<br />or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
883958 885540 You know, I think you're worrying<br />too much.
885541 888207 You have a lot of support<br />in the black community.
889250 892290 All right. If we can't duck this thing,<br />we're gonna have to neutralize it.
892291 896707 What we need is a picture of me<br />pinning a medal on a black man.
897333 898499 Bruce?
900333 903207 The firefighter.<br />The one who saved the camp or something.
903208 904874 Northridge. What's his name?
904875 906207 He's Iraql.
907208 908415 He's Iraql?
909041 910707 Well, he looks black.
910708 914040 He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraql.<br />His name's Saddam Khahum.
914041 916707 Saddam? His name's Saddam?
916708 918374 Well, that's real good, Bruce.
918375 921749 Yeah, I'm gonna pin a medal<br />on an Iraql named Saddam.
921750 923415 Give yourself a raise, will you?
926500 929374 It's been good doing business with you.
930083 933415 - How soon can I have them?<br />- I'm picking them up right now.
933416 936957 Look, you're not listening to me.<br />This is an emergency.
936958 939499 I keep telling you he's in pain.<br />He can't sleep.
939500 944082 Mr. Ryan, your father has been to<br />the clinic three times in the last month.
944083 947082 He is being treated<br />for a urinary tract infection.
947083 949499 <i>That is by no means an emergency.</i>
949500 953082 Now, if you have any more questions<br />about your HMO plan,
953083 956124 why don't you make an appointment<br />to come in between 10:00 and 4:00,
956125 957415 Monday through Friday?
957416 959582 What does my father do<br />about sleeping tonight?
959583 961540 I don't know. I'm not a doctor.
961541 964332 - I wanna talk to your supervisor.<br />- I am my supervisor.
964333 967040 - Yeah, what is your name?<br />- Shaniqua Johnson.
967041 969415 Shaniqua. Big fucking surprise that is.
969416 970457 Oh...
985416 987874 <i>1005 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.</i>
987875 990915 <i>Vehicle described as a black,<br />late-model Lincoln Navigator.</i>
990916 995290 <i>California plates, 4 Peter Charles Ida 315.</i>
995291 998374 <i>Suspects are two black males,<br />approximately 20 years of age.</i>
1006875 1008332 That's not it.
1009458 1011874 That's not the vehicle, John.<br />The plates don't match.
1011875 1015374 The driver's gotta be 40, and nobody<br />jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.
1020958 1022957 They were doing something.
1066916 1068332 Enthusiastic.
1070000 1072707 Keep your hands<br />where I can see them, please.
1073083 1076582 I'm gonna need to see your driver's license<br />and registration.
1076583 1079332 No problem. I'm gonna have to
1079333 1082332 reach inside of the glove compartment<br />to get the registration.
1082333 1084707 - Is that okay?<br />- Nice and slow, please.
1084708 1085790 Okay.
1090916 1092540 How are you tonight, Officer?
1093416 1094790 Excellent.
1096416 1097832 Here you go.
1101916 1104207 Stay inside the vehicle, please.
1112750 1114790 Let's do it again right now.
1115750 1118040 Step out of the car, please, sir.
1118666 1121915 Wait, wait a minute, Officer.<br />I haven't been drinking or anything.
1121916 1123582 Then we shouldn't have a problem.
1123583 1126582 He doesn't drink.<br />He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.
1126583 1128165 No, it's okay.
1128666 1129999 It's fine.
1135208 1137290 Step onto the sidewalk, sir.
1138916 1140874 That's good. Right there.
1142791 1143915 Look at me.
1145333 1147624 I want you to stand on your right foot.
1147625 1150957 Touch your nose<br />with the index finger of your left hand.
1155958 1158082 I told you he doesn't drink.
1158083 1161582 Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you one time<br />to stay in the vehicle.
1161583 1164082 - Ma'am?<br />- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.
1164083 1165374 Don't you "ma'am" me.
1165375 1167415 Who the hell do you think<br />you're talking to?
1167416 1170582 Look, Officer,<br />my wife has had a couple of drinks...
1170583 1172082 All right, both of you turn around.
1172083 1173999 Put your hands on top of your head<br />and interlock your fingers.
1174000 1176165 No, wait. Wait a minute.<br />We're only a block away from our house.
1176166 1177415 Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
1177416 1178915 - That's not even necessary.<br />- Hands on your head.
1178916 1179957 Interlock your fingers.
1179958 1181832 Look, I'm a television director.
1182125 1184374 Me and my wife were just coming home<br />from an awards show.
1184375 1186665 Get your hands off him.<br />He has done nothing wrong.
1186666 1188415 Put your hands<br />on top of your head, ma'am.
1188416 1190374 - Will you just do what he says?<br />- Fuck you!
1190375 1192165 Put your hands<br />on top of your head, ma'am.
1192166 1194290 And you keep<br />your filthy fucking hands off me!
1194583 1197499 - You motherfucking pig!<br />- Christine, just stop talking.
1198000 1199957 That's quite a mouth you have.
1200583 1202040 Of course you know that.
1202041 1204790 Fuck you!<br />That's what this is all about, isn't it?
1205083 1207249 You thought you saw<br />a white woman blowing a black man,
1207250 1208957 and that just<br />drove your little cracker ass crazy.
1208958 1210915 Will you just shut your fucking mouth?
1210916 1213332 I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.
1213750 1215499 Put your legs open.
1217791 1221665 Now, do you have any guns or knives<br />or anything I might get stuck with?
1222041 1224374 I'm wearing a cocktail dress.<br />What do you think?
1224375 1226999 You'd be surprised some of the places<br />I've found weapons.
1227000 1228374 He's clean.
1229583 1232374 What do you think we should do about this,<br />Mr. Thayer?
1233583 1237290 My partner and I just witnessed your wife<br />performing fellatio on you
1237291 1239999 while you were operating a motor vehicle.
1240000 1243790 That's reckless endangerment,<br />which, incidentally, is a felony.
1245458 1247540 Now we can charge your wife here
1247541 1250957 with lewd conduct<br />and performing a sexual act in public.
1252291 1254707 Now you say you're a block from home.
1256000 1257957 Now, we could use our discretion
1258416 1260332 and let you go with a warning,
1261041 1264040 or we can cuff you<br />and put you in the back of the car.
1266416 1268707 What do you think we should do, sir?
1276875 1278374 Look, we're sorry,
1280583 1284707 and we would appreciate if you would<br />just let us go with a warning, please.
1289916 1292040 The man's apologizing, Tommy.
1293500 1296374 I think we can let him go. Don't you?
1299083 1300165 Yeah.
1300666 1301957 All right.
1303666 1304999 You can go.
1315041 1317124 You folks drive safe now, huh?
1351250 1352832 Let's go, Tommy.
1361916 1363665 It won't close.
1364708 1366124 I can do that.
1366125 1368082 Dad, you couldn't even get it open.
1368083 1370582 Have respect for your father.<br />Give me the gun.
1371666 1374540 Here. Now you can shoot<br />anybody you want.
1374541 1377415 Dorri, that man could've<br />killed your mother.
1377416 1380790 You think I should let crazy people<br />do what they want to us?
1380791 1382915 Farhad, it won't close.
1387083 1389540 Dorri, you should be at work.
1401791 1403582 Who are you calling?
1403583 1406457 I'm gonna report their asses.<br />Sons of bitches.
1406750 1410165 You actually believe they're gonna take<br />anything you have to say seriously?
1410166 1414290 Do you have any idea how that felt?<br />To have that pig's hands all over me?
1414291 1416207 And you just stood there.
1418375 1420082 And then you apologized to him?
1420083 1423249 I mean, what did you want me to do?<br />Get us both shot?
1423250 1426957 They were gonna shoot us<br />on Ventura Boulevard? Pathetic.
1426958 1430540 Yeah, well, maybe you would've<br />been satisfied with just being arrested.
1430541 1434749 Oh, I get it. Much better to let him<br />shove his hand up my crotch
1434750 1436915 than get your name in the paper.
1437583 1439415 You know, you finally got me figured out,
1439416 1442582 'cause see, that's exactly<br />what I was worried about, right there.
1442583 1445874 Oh, and it wasn't? You weren't afraid<br />that all your good friends at the studio
1445875 1448082 were gonna read about you in the morning<br />and realize that,
1448083 1450165 you know what, he's actually black?
1451500 1453207 You need to calm down right now.
1453208 1456790 No, what I need is a husband<br />who will not just stand there
1456791 1458415 while I am being molested!
1458416 1461874 I mean, they were cops, for God's sakes!<br />They had guns!
1462916 1465915 You know what?<br />Maybe I should've let them arrest your ass.
1465916 1470582 I mean, sooner or later you gotta find out<br />what it is really like to be black.
1470583 1472790 Fuck you, man. Like you know.
1472791 1476415 The closest you ever came to being black,<br />Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.
1476416 1479832 Yeah, well, at least I wasn't watching it<br />with the rest of the equestrian team.
1479833 1481082 Yeah, you're right, Cameron.
1481083 1484624 I got a lot to learn 'cause I haven't<br />quite learned how to shuck and jive.
1484625 1488207 Let me hear it again.<br />"Thank you, Mr. Policeman.
1488208 1490749 "You sure is mighty kind<br />to us poor black folk.
1490750 1494624 "You be sure to let me know next time<br />you wanna finger-fuck my wife."
1496750 1499707 How the fuck do you say<br />something like that to me?
1500916 1502624 You know, fuck you!
1504291 1507457 That's good. A little anger.<br />It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!
1557583 1559707 - How's it going?<br />- Okay.
1560916 1563082 You didn't get scared or something,<br />did you?
1563083 1566374 There's no monsters in the closet, right?<br />'Cause I hate monsters.
1566375 1569790 - There's no such thing as monsters.<br />- Oh, that's a good thing.
1570916 1572540 I heard a bang.
1572833 1574457 Like a truck bang?
1575041 1576374 Like a gun.
1583458 1587082 That's funny, because we moved out<br />of that bad neighborhood.
1587250 1589999 And there's not too many guns<br />around here.
1591666 1593540 How far can bullets go?
1594083 1595749 They go pretty far.
1596083 1599124 But they usually get stuck in something<br />and stop.
1599125 1600832 What if they don't?
1602166 1605207 You thinking about that bullet<br />that came through your window?
1607875 1610374 Because we never did find it, did we?
1610750 1613624 I think it didn't see me<br />'cause I was under the covers.
1615958 1619040 And you think it was that same bullet<br />that you heard tonight?
1622500 1625582 - You think we should move again?<br />- I like it here.
1625583 1628582 Me, too. But if that bullet found out<br />where we lived...
1629291 1630832 Oh, hold on.
1630833 1631999 What?
1632000 1634749 So stupid! How can I forget?
1635375 1636457 What?
1638541 1640457 No, forget it. You ain't gonna believe me.
1640458 1641665 Tell me.
1642875 1643915 Okay.
1645416 1649124 When I was five,<br />this fairy came into my room one night.
1649125 1650249 Right.
1650250 1652374 See, I told you<br />you weren't gonna believe me.
1652375 1655249 - Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.<br />- No, tell me.
1656500 1657540 Okay.
1658833 1663374 So this fairy comes into my room and<br />I'm like, "Yeah, right, you're a fairy."
1664125 1666249 Anyway, we're talking, you know.
1666250 1669915 And she's flying all around the room,<br />knocking down all my posters and stuff.
1669916 1671457 She was flying?
1671458 1674874 Yeah, but she had these little stubby<br />wings. She could've glued them on, you know?
1674875 1677582 Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.
1677583 1679624 So she said, "I'll prove it."
1679625 1682040 So she reaches into her backpack,
1682041 1684540 and she pulls out this invisible cloak.
1684541 1688415 She ties it around my neck,<br />and she tells me that it's impenetrable.
1689208 1691249 You know what "impenetrable" means?
1691625 1693957 It means that nothing can go through it.
1693958 1695707 No bullets. Nothing.
1695958 1699499 She told me that if I wore it,<br />nothing would hurt me.
1699916 1701124 So I did.
1701375 1705582 And my whole life,<br />I never got shot, stabbed. Nothing.
1706333 1707999 I mean, how weird is that?
1708958 1710874 Only she told me<br />that I was supposed to give it
1710875 1713457 to my daughter on her fifth birthday<br />and I forgot.
1714291 1715832 Can I touch it?
1716333 1717832 Sure, go ahead.
1719916 1722624 - I don't feel it.<br />- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?
1723291 1725624 If you want I can take it off<br />and tie it around your shoulders.
1725625 1727624 She told me how to do it.
1727625 1729957 Unless you think it's stupid then...
1729958 1732874 - Don't you need it?<br />- No, not anymore.
1734333 1736707 So what do you think? You want it?
1742625 1744707 Okay, let's get out of here.
1750583 1751624 Okay.
1765708 1767332 Hold your chin up.
1773041 1774874 Okay. Is that too tight?
1775583 1777374 Do you feel anything at all?
1778750 1781124 Good. Then it's just right.
1788000 1789957 Do I take it off when I have a bath?
1789958 1794249 No, you leave it on all the time.<br />Until you have a daughter.
1794250 1797457 When she turns five,<br />then you give it to her.
1798416 1799499 Okay?
1800333 1801332 Okay.
1803625 1804707 Okay.
1806250 1809040 - Good night, sweetie.<br />- Good night.
1849750 1853957 No, no. You wanna listen to music<br />of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.
1853958 1857749 How in the lunacy of your mind<br />is hip-hop music of the oppressor?
1857750 1860915 Listen to it, man.<br />"Nigger this, nigger that."
1860916 1864415 You think white people go around<br />calling each other honkies all day, man?
1864416 1866124 Hey, honky, how's business?
1866125 1868457 Going great, cracker. We're diversifying.
1868458 1871499 How about this, huh? How about that?<br />Listen to that. You like that?
1871500 1873040 Man's singing about lynching niggers.
1873041 1875249 And you think there's a difference,<br />don't you? Huh?
1875250 1878999 <i>Gonna buy me a rope<br />and lynch me a nigger</i>
1879000 1882249 You got absolutely no idea<br />where hip-hop music comes from, do you?
1882250 1884499 <i>I'd shoot them dead first<br />but I done broke my trigger</i>
1884500 1887499 You see, back in the '60s<br />we had smart, articulate black men.
1887500 1889665 <i>Gonna get out my sheet<br />Put my hood on my head</i>
1889666 1892665 Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,<br />Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.
1892666 1894124 <i>Gonna string them up good</i>
1894125 1896624 These brothers were speaking out,<br />and people were listening!
1896625 1897832 <i>Then they'll be dead</i>
1897833 1900082 And then the FBI said,<br />"Oh, no, we can't have that."
1900083 1902124 <i>In the home of the brave<br />and the land of the free</i>
1902125 1905707 "I know, let's give the niggers this music<br />by a bunch of mumbling idiots
1905708 1907415 "and sooner or later, they'll all copy it,
1907416 1910165 "and nobody will be able to understand<br />a fucking word they say.
1910166 1911374 "End of problem."
1919125 1921290 What the fuck was that, dawg?
1935125 1936415 Holy shit!
1936916 1939540 - What?<br />- Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.
1939916 1942082 You're saying there's a Chinaman<br />under this truck?
1942083 1943499 What part don't you understand?
1943500 1946624 There's a Chinaman<br />stuck underneath the fucking truck.
1948416 1949707 Help me.
1952083 1953790 Oh, God.
1953791 1956874 What the hell did he do,<br />just leap out in front of the truck?
1956875 1959082 Man, this is so completely fucked up.
1959083 1961457 Oh, really? No shit!
1961458 1963874 Okay, hold up. Hold up, hold up, hold up.
1964625 1966290 - Get back in the truck.<br />- What?
1966291 1969082 - Yes, get back in the truck.<br />- You think we didn't drag him far enough?
1969083 1971915 No, no we gonna drive away.<br />And he gonna let go.
1971916 1974249 He's not gonna let go, Anthony.<br />You know why?
1974250 1977374 Because he's stuck underneath<br />the fucking truck!
1977375 1978624 Now, if he could've let go,
1978625 1981915 he probably would've considered<br />that option about a half a block back.
1981916 1983624 Now, what you and I gotta do,
1983625 1985707 just grab his arms<br />and pull him from underneath.
1985708 1987540 You grab his arm, it's gonna fall off.
1987541 1990957 Then you gonna be standing in the middle<br />of the street holding a Chinaman's arm.
1990958 1992749 Then what your ass gonna do, huh?
1992750 1996957 If we leave this man here, he dies.<br />Then we're up for murder charges.
1997458 2000207 Now just grab his arm.<br />Why not just pull him out?
2005875 2007874 I don't wanna<br />cause any problems, Lieutenant.
2007875 2009415 I just want a new partner.
2009416 2011874 I understand. Your<br />partner's a racist prick.
2011875 2014207 But you don't wanna stir up<br />any bad feelings with him.
2014208 2016374 Well, he's been on<br />the force for a long time.
2016375 2019624 - Seventeen years.<br />- And I do have to work here, sir.
2020208 2022915 So you don't mind<br />that there's a racist prick on the force.
2022916 2025915 You just don't want<br />him to ride in your car.
2025916 2028790 If you need me to go on record<br />about this, sir, I will.
2028791 2031374 That'd be great. Write a full report.
2031625 2033915 Because I'm anxious to understand<br />how an obvious bigot
2033916 2036749 could've gone undetected<br />in this department for 17 years,
2036750 2039249 11 of which he was under<br />my personal supervision,
2039250 2041999 which doesn't speak very highly<br />of my managerial skills.
2042000 2045290 But that's not your concern.<br />I can't wait to read it.
2046000 2049124 What if I said I wanted a new partner<br />for personal reasons?
2049125 2050957 So now you're saying<br />he's not a racist prick,
2050958 2052874 you just don't like him.
2053458 2056207 - Yes, sir.<br />- That's not a good enough reason.
2056458 2059374 Well, then, I guess I should think<br />of a better one and get back to you.
2059375 2061749 So you think<br />I'm asking you to make one up.
2062333 2065540 No, sir. I just can't<br />think of one right now.
2066458 2068540 You wanna know what I heard?
2070041 2072540 I heard it was a case<br />of uncontrollable flatulence.
2072958 2076040 - You want me to say he has flatulence?<br />- Not him. You.
2076041 2077624 You have uncontrollable flatulence.
2077625 2079457 You're too embarrassed<br />to ride with anybody else,
2079458 2081124 so you're requesting a one-man car.
2081125 2084124 I'm not... comfortable<br />with that, Lieutenant.
2084125 2085582 I wouldn't be either.
2085583 2087582 Which is why I understand<br />your need for privacy.
2087583 2091082 Just like I'm sure you understand<br />how hard a black man has to work to get to,
2091083 2094790 say, where I am, in a racist fucking<br />organization like the LAPD
2094791 2097124 and how easily that can be taken away.
2097125 2100165 Now, that being said, it's your decision.
2100416 2104665 You can put your career and mine<br />on the line in pursuit of a just cause,
2105416 2108624 or you can admit to having<br />an embarrassing problem
2109250 2111040 of a personal nature.
2115958 2117040 Fuck.
2147583 2148874 Excuse me.
2149916 2151415 Excuse me. Sir?
2152625 2155124 - You finished?<br />- I replaced the lock.
2155375 2157499 But you got a real problem with that door.
2158375 2161415 - You fix the lock?<br />- No, I replaced the lock.
2161958 2165707 - But you gotta fix that door.<br />- Just fix the lock.
2165708 2167874 Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.
2167875 2170832 What you need is a new door.
2171250 2173332 - I need new door?<br />- Yeah.
2173791 2176332 Okay. How much?
2177000 2178415 I don't...
2178416 2181124 Sir, you're gonna have to call somebody<br />that sells doors.
2181125 2184874 You try to cheat me, right, huh?<br />You have a friend that fix door?
2184875 2186874 No, I don't have a<br />friend that fix doors, bro.
2186875 2189790 Then go and fix the fucking lock,<br />you cheater.
2189791 2192040 You... You know what?
2192041 2195290 Why don't you just pay for the lock,<br />and I won't charge you for the time.
2195291 2198540 You don't fix the lock! I pay?<br />What, you think I'm stupid?
2198541 2201207 You fix the fucking lock, you cheater!
2201208 2203249 Hey, I'd appreciate it<br />if you'd stop calling me names.
2203250 2205915 - Then fix the fucking lock!<br />- I replaced the lock!
2205916 2210082 - You gotta fix the fucking door!<br />- You cheat! You fucking cheater!
2210708 2213082 - Fine. Don't pay.<br />- What?
2214208 2216790 - Have a good night.<br />- What? No. Wait!
2216791 2219915 Wait! You come back here! You fix the lock!
2219916 2223582 Come here! You fix my lock!<br />Fix the fucking lock!
2229500 2230874 No, I understand.
2230875 2233749 You run over a Chinaman,<br />stuff him in the back,
2233750 2236749 then bring the truck here<br />so I can share in the experience.
2236750 2239582 Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.<br />It'll wash right off.
2239583 2241207 Georgie, burn this thing.
2241208 2244582 Burn it? It's a brand-new Navigator.<br />All you need is a little piece of carpet.
2244583 2246915 You watch the Discovery Channel?
2247083 2249999 - Not a lot.<br />- They got some good shit on that channel.
2250000 2253707 Every night there is a show<br />with somebody shining a little blue light
2253708 2258165 and finding tiny specks of blood splattered<br />on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,
2258166 2262582 bathroom fixtures and special-edition<br />plastic Burger King tray cups.
2263166 2266415 Then the next thing they show<br />is some stupid redneck in handcuffs
2266416 2270082 who looks absolutely stunned<br />that this is happening to him.
2270416 2273957 Sometimes the redneck<br />is actually watching the Discovery Channel
2273958 2275915 when they break in to arrest him.
2275916 2279999 And he still can't figure out<br />how on earth they could've caught him!
2289041 2292249 Do I look like I wanna be<br />on the Discovery Channel?
2293458 2296082 - No.<br />- Then get the fuck out of my shop.
2300000 2302499 Oh, yeah, make sure you get that.
2302500 2305624 Without him, things could've gone<br />really fucking wrong tonight.
2307041 2310707 - Fuck! This could be a...<br />- Graham, don't! Don't! Don't you dare.
2311250 2312790 Don't.
2312791 2314249 Graham Waters.
2316041 2319249 No. No, he's not here, Mom.
2319750 2321249 - It's your mother?<br />- Yeah.
2321750 2323874 I'm not gonna go looking for him.
2324791 2328040 Look, he'll be home when he...<br />Just leave it alone, Mom.
2328041 2331415 Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?<br />I'm having sex with a white woman.
2333000 2334582 Okay, where were we?
2335791 2338665 I was white, and you were about<br />to jerk off in the shower.
2338666 2339874 Oh, shit.
2341916 2343124 Come on.
2343416 2344915 I would've said you were Mexican,
2344916 2347415 but I don't think<br />it would've pissed her off as much.
2348250 2351540 Why do you keep everybody<br />at a certain distance, huh?
2351541 2353540 What, you start to feel something<br />and panic?
2353541 2355082 Come on, Ria.
2355083 2357415 You're just pissed<br />'cause I answered the phone.
2358250 2360499 That's just where I begin to get pissed.
2360500 2364499 I mean, really, what kind of man<br />speaks to his mother that way, huh?
2364500 2368124 Oh, this is about my mother.<br />What do you know about my mother?
2368416 2371832 I know if I was your father,<br />I'd kick your fucking ass.
2372500 2374415 Okay. I was raised badly.
2374416 2378082 Why don't you take your clothes off,<br />get back in the bed and teach me a lesson?
2378083 2380415 You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.
2380416 2382415 How about a geography lesson?
2382416 2386249 My father's from Puerto Rico.<br />My mother's from El Salvador.
2386666 2389040 Neither one of those is Mexico.
2389583 2392290 Well, then I guess the big mystery is
2392291 2395415 who gathered all those<br />remarkably different cultures together
2395416 2398415 and taught them all<br />how to park their cars on their lawns?
2426750 2428207 Pop, you okay?
2428916 2431374 If I could piss, I'd be okay.
2433458 2435707 I'm... Jesus.
2436375 2437790 I'm done now.
2439125 2440624 Give me a hand.
2443541 2445374 Wait a goddamn minute.
2445541 2448207 - Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2450250 2453457 - All right. Okay. Okay.<br />- Okay. There you go.
2460875 2463040 Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.
2463666 2465540 - I gotta go back.<br />- Okay.
2478750 2481457 What, are you gonna stand there<br />and stare at me?
2551125 2553415 So Conklin just shot him?
2553416 2555249 - They know each other?<br />- Sir.
2555250 2558165 - This a grudge thing?<br />- Not as far as we can tell.
2560250 2561874 You think this is racially motivated?
2561875 2565249 Well, a dozen people heard the shots.<br />Nobody saw anything.
2565250 2567915 - Who do we have on it?<br />- Graham Waters.
2567916 2571207 Waters. All right, well, tell him<br />that he speaks to no one but me.
2571208 2574582 Call a press conference for 4:00,<br />and I want Waters here at 3:30.
2574583 2576457 And would someone please find Flanagan?
2578583 2580374 - Oh, what up, Mo Phat?<br />- What's up?
2581583 2583999 Man robs purses from old ladies<br />and you all,
2584000 2586124 "Hey, how's it going, Mo Phat?"
2586125 2588915 That nigger will steal teeth<br />from a cripple, man.
2589333 2592082 You calling him a thief? And we do what?
2592083 2594040 The man steals from black people.
2594041 2596332 Only reason black people<br />steal from their own
2596333 2598207 is 'cause they terrified of white people.
2598208 2599665 Oh, man, please.
2599666 2603249 Think about it.<br />Sherman Oaks. Burbank. Santa Monica.
2603250 2605790 All scary-ass places<br />for a brother to find himself.
2605791 2608332 Now, drop Mo Phat off<br />at a Starbucks in Toluca Lake,
2608333 2612332 that nigger will run like a rabbit<br />soon as somebody say "decaf latte."
2613083 2615540 What the fuck did you do to my car?
2623916 2626165 Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.
2626750 2629249 I turn key to my car, but nothing.
2630333 2634665 James wanted to take this to school,<br />but I don't want the kids to fight over it.
2634666 2638082 - Are these clean or dirty?<br />- All clean, se�ora.
2638666 2640999 You know, Maria,<br />just once I would like to wake up
2641000 2643290 and find these dishes in the cabinet.
2644500 2647165 - Okay?<br />- S�, se�ora. No problem.
2648916 2650540 I'm starting to understand now.
2650541 2653874 By your work, you're setting an example<br />for our neighborhood.
2653875 2656374 Sort of like a big brother<br />kind of thing, right?
2657250 2658957 Well, yeah, you laugh, man.
2658958 2663040 But you have never seen me steal<br />from a black person ever in your life.
2664958 2667290 What the hell do you think<br />you doing right now, man?
2667291 2668999 Waving down the bus.
2669000 2671624 Man, put your hand down, dawg!<br />Are you out of your mind?
2671625 2673749 You actually expect me to get on a bus?
2673750 2676082 No. I was hoping we could push your car<br />across town.
2676083 2678832 You know why? 'Cause we just<br />don't do stuff like that no more.
2678833 2680915 You have no idea, do you?
2680916 2683124 You have no idea<br />why they put them great big windows
2683125 2684707 on the sides of buses, do you?
2684708 2687290 - Why?<br />- One reason only.
2687291 2690999 To humiliate the people of color<br />who are reduced to riding on them.
2691458 2692957 How do you know that?
2692958 2696374 You know, you could fill the Staples Center<br />with what you don't know.
2696375 2698374 Oh, you know,<br />the Kings are playing tonight.
2698375 2701874 You don't like hockey! The only reason<br />you say you do is to piss me off!
2702458 2703832 I love hockey.
2703833 2705957 Cut! Print. Moving on.
2705958 2710082 Okay, that takes us into scene 12,<br />and we are in the bathroom.
2710083 2713374 Jamal, that's what I'm talking about.
2713375 2714582 Right on.
2716583 2720207 - Cam, Cam, you got a second?<br />- Yeah, Fred. I just wanna grab some coffee.
2720208 2722874 Yeah, listen,<br />I think we needed another take, buddy.
2723416 2725374 That looked pretty terrific, man.
2725791 2729749 This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal<br />seeing a speech coach or something?
2730250 2731540 What do you mean?
2731916 2733582 Have you noticed...
2733916 2735999 I mean, this is weird<br />for a white guy to say,
2736000 2739582 but have you noticed<br />he's talking a lot less black lately?
2741333 2743915 - No, I haven't noticed that.<br />- Really?
2743916 2747415 Like in this scene, he was supposed to say,<br />"Don't be talkin' 'bout that."
2747416 2749749 And he changed it to,<br />"Don't talk to me about that."
2749750 2752415 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />You think because of that,
2752416 2755832 the audience won't recognize him<br />as being a black man?
2755833 2758374 - Come on.<br />- Is there a problem, Cam?
2759250 2762290 - Excuse me?<br />- Is there a problem, Cam?
2767875 2770040 No, we don't have a problem.
2770416 2773999 I mean, 'cause all I'm saying is,<br />it's not his character.
2774000 2776624 Eddie's supposed to be the smart one,<br />not Jamal, right?
2776625 2779874 I mean, you're the expert here,<br />but to me, it rings false.
2783916 2787749 - We're gonna do it one more time.<br />- Thanks, buddy.
2787750 2790999 Everybody back to one, please.<br />Let's do it one more time.
2794333 2795707 Jamal...
2800583 2803290 - Morning, Carol. Who do I have?<br />- Hold for a minute, please.
2803291 2807040 Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,<br />but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.
2811416 2812790 Send him in.
2814833 2816374 - Mr. Ryan.<br />- Yeah.
2816375 2818582 My name is Shaniqua Johnson.
2818583 2820374 I believe we spoke last night.
2821291 2823915 Oh, yeah. I wanted to apologize about that.
2824416 2827999 I haven't been getting too much sleep.<br />My father's in a lot of pain.
2828000 2830082 Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
2830250 2834499 This doctor he's been seeing<br />says he's got a urinary tract infection.
2834500 2836624 But he's been taking this medicine<br />for a month now,
2836625 2837999 and he just keeps getting worse.
2838000 2840832 - And he's been back to see Dr. Robertson?<br />- Yeah.
2841416 2844374 - Between you and me, the man's an idiot.<br />- Really?
2844375 2846999 Well, no offense,<br />but the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
2847000 2849082 I think his nurses<br />are doing most of the work.
2850041 2854207 If you're unhappy, your father's welcome<br />to see a doctor outside the network.
2855125 2858415 And if this new doctor<br />says it's not an infection,
2858416 2861665 says it's his prostate and it needs to be<br />operated on, is that gonna be covered?
2861666 2865290 - Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...<br />- Then what good is that gonna do?
2866000 2868749 I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
2869041 2871290 All right. Well, you know what I can't do?
2872250 2874874 I can't look at you<br />without thinking about the five or six
2874875 2877499 more-qualified white men<br />who didn't get your job.
2877500 2878915 It's time for you to go.
2878916 2882207 Now, I'm saying this 'cause<br />I'm really hoping that I'm wrong about you.
2882208 2884165 I'm hoping that someone like yourself,
2884166 2886290 someone who may have been given<br />a helping hand,
2886291 2889082 might have a little compassion<br />for someone in a similar situation.
2889083 2891207 Carol, I need security in my office.
2891208 2894040 You know, you don't like me, that's fine.<br />I'm a prick.
2894458 2897415 But my father doesn't deserve<br />to suffer like this.
2897416 2899582 He was a janitor.<br />He struggled his whole life.
2899583 2901540 Saved enough to start his own company.
2901541 2903290 Twenty-three employees, all of them black.
2903291 2906290 Paid them equal wages<br />when no one else was doing that.
2906291 2908665 For 30 years<br />he worked side by side with those men,
2908666 2911124 sweeping and carrying garbage.
2911125 2912790 And then the city council decides
2912791 2916540 to give minority-owned companies<br />preference in city contracts.
2916541 2918999 And overnight, my father loses everything.
2919458 2922040 His business, his home, his wife.<br />Everything.
2923250 2925707 Not once does he blame your people.
2927583 2929665 I'm not asking you to help me.
2930166 2934290 I'm asking that you do this small thing<br />for a man who lost everything
2934583 2937165 so people like yourself<br />could reap the benefits.
2937166 2940249 And do you know<br />what it's gonna cost you? Nothing.
2941416 2943290 Just a flick of your pen.
2945041 2947749 Your father sounds like a good man.
2947750 2952124 And if he'd come in here today,<br />I probably would've approved this request.
2952125 2956915 But he didn't come in. You did.<br />And for his sake, it's a real shame.
2956916 2959415 - Get him the hell out of my office.<br />- Prick.
2966916 2968915 Yeah, sir, I spoke to our employee,
2968916 2971374 and he told you you needed to replace<br />or repair the door.
2971375 2973374 He say he fix the lock.
2973375 2976415 <i>- You come here, see how fixed it is!<br />- You're yelling again.</i>
2976416 2978124 I am not yelling! I'm upset!
2979750 2982040 - Yes, I am.<br />- Mom, are you all right?
2983208 2987415 Stop washing. Insurance must take picture.<br />Okay?
2988541 2990790 - Yes.<br />- Look what they wrote.
2992083 2994582 - They think we're Arab.<br />- Please, you come see my store.
2994583 2996207 When did Persian become Arab?
2996208 2999290 I want... I want his name. Yes.
2999291 3000624 Oh, my God.
3000875 3002707 - I want his name!<br />- Dad.
3002708 3004082 - Give me his name!<br />- Dad.
3004083 3005540 I'm not giving you his name, sir.
3005541 3006915 Dad, did they take the gun?
3006916 3009415 - Not fix my lock! I want his name!<br />- Baba.
3009416 3011707 <i>- I'm gonna hang up now, sir.<br />- Don't hang up!</i>
3011708 3013832 Don't hang up! Shit!
3015500 3016957 Oh, thank God.
3062666 3063999 Mom?
3065791 3068040 Mom, it's cold. Come on.
3091041 3093040 Did you find your brother?
3095000 3096207 No, Mom.
3106750 3108457 I was doing good.
3110125 3113499 I was... I was doing real good.
3115708 3118207 - I know, Mom.<br />- I was doing good.
3123083 3124374 It's okay.
3136416 3138415 Did you find your brother?
3141000 3142249 No, Mom.
3144583 3146790 Tell him to come home.
3148458 3151790 Tell him I'm not mad, okay?
3153000 3154332 Okay, baby?
3154750 3158040 - Okay, Mom.<br />- Okay, baby.
3159333 3160749 Okay.
3161875 3163040 Okay.
3199541 3202290 - Did you apologize to your mother?<br />- She wasn't there.
3204666 3208290 Internal Affairs called.<br />Found something in the Mercedes.
3210666 3212374 That's lunch. One hour.
3241958 3243457 I tried to call.
3243916 3246249 Sounded like you were having<br />a bad day, huh?
3246250 3247290 Yeah.
3251958 3253040 What?
3254833 3256624 I got scared, Cam.
3257583 3261707 You know, it's not like I haven't been<br />pulled over before, you know?
3262583 3264165 But nothing like that.
3266125 3268290 And, yes, I was a little drunk
3269166 3271124 and I was mouthing off.
3271875 3273165 I'm sorry.
3276458 3278624 But when that man<br />was putting his hands on me...
3278625 3279915 I don't wanna talk about it.
3279916 3282749 I couldn't believe<br />you'd let him do that, baby.
3284541 3288165 Look, I know what you did<br />was the right thing. Okay?
3289833 3291624 But I was humiliated.
3292750 3293915 For you.
3295125 3298874 I just couldn't stand to see that man<br />take away your dignity.
3299875 3302457 Yeah. That's what happened.
3302625 3304374 Oh, baby, don't do this.
3304375 3306207 - No. No, you're right.<br />- Come on.
3306208 3307624 I ain't doing it.
3307625 3309665 You gonna walk away from me?
3311000 3312874 - Cameron!<br />- Just go home.
3322583 3323957 I understand.
3324833 3325999 Thanks.
3329833 3332874 - Has your father read his policy?<br />- He doesn't read English.
3337250 3340040 Mr. Golzari,<br />you said that you called the locksmith?
3341166 3343082 Yes. I tell him, fix it.
3343625 3345707 They said that their man told you
3347250 3349499 to fix the door, and you didn't do so.
3351416 3353332 Are you saying it's his fault?
3354833 3359457 Insurance company is calling it negligence.<br />They're not covering any of this.
3367916 3368874 No.
3369791 3371790 This store is all we have.
3389250 3390874 I really am sorry.
3414125 3416082 What time you must go to work?
3416083 3417707 Not until tonight.
3419083 3420707 Go home and sleep.
3424000 3426707 It's okay. It's okay. Go home and sleep.
3449791 3450915 Hey.
3452625 3456082 Maybe they didn't tell you,<br />but I've been reassigned.
3456083 3457540 Yeah, they told me.
3458541 3462665 I just wanted to say good luck<br />and it was good riding with you.
3463083 3464374 You, too.
3468583 3471499 Wait till you've been on the job<br />a few more years.
3471500 3473457 - Yeah.<br />- Look at me, look at me.
3475583 3478374 Wait till you've been<br />doing it a little longer.
3479541 3481790 You think you know who you are?
3483875 3485457 You have no idea.
3490041 3493124 Yo, Gomez, you ready to roll, homie?
3493125 3494540 Ready, amigo.
3504375 3506499 Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.
3507583 3511415 <i>21-L-23, picking up strange noises<br />from your car.</i>
3512375 3515999 <i>Likewise, 21-L.<br />Is your mike open by any chance?</i>
3648250 3649582 Call it in.
3687875 3690249 Ma'am? Can you hear me?
3690583 3693249 Paramedics are rolling.<br />They'll be here in two minutes.
3693250 3695624 All right. Get an extinguisher,<br />and get that fire out.
3695625 3696707 Jesus.
3700041 3702624 Ma'am, are you hurt?
3703458 3707290 - Can you move?<br />- I can't breathe.
3709750 3712165 Okay. Okay, I'm gonna get you out.
3719500 3720957 It's okay.
3725125 3727249 Okay. Okay.
3727916 3729874 Okay, I'm gonna get you out.
3735166 3737040 - No.<br />- It's okay.
3737041 3739165 - Get away from me.<br />- It's okay.
3739166 3741749 Get away from me. Stay away from me.
3742750 3744457 - Not you!<br />- Fuck it.
3744458 3746624 - Not you!<br />- It's okay.
3746625 3750332 Don't touch me! Don't touch me!<br />Keep away from me!
3750333 3752582 Lady, I'm trying... I'm trying to help you.
3752583 3755749 Fuck you! Not you!
3755750 3757999 Somebody! Anybody else!
3758000 3759915 - Please, somebody!<br />- Stop moving!
3759916 3761124 Not you!
3761833 3765165 No! Get your filthy fucking hands off me!
3765166 3766582 - Stop moving.<br />- No!
3766583 3768749 Lady, I'm not gonna fucking hurt you!
3774750 3777290 Okay. Okay.
3777791 3779915 Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.
3779916 3782207 I'm not gonna touch you.
3782208 3785540 But there's nobody else here yet,<br />and that's gasoline there.
3787041 3790415 We need to get you out of here<br />right away. Okay?
3790750 3794207 - Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<br />- Okay.
3795000 3799124 I need to reach across your lap.<br />Can I do that, please?
3801750 3803540 Yeah. Yeah.
3805166 3806332 Thanks.
3811833 3813540 Is anything broken?
3814750 3816457 I don't think so.
3817250 3819540 Okay. I think that's good.
3820750 3823540 - Are you gonna get me out?<br />- Yeah.
3824250 3826165 I'm gonna get you out. Okay?
3826166 3828874 Look at me. Look at me.<br />I'm gonna get you out.
3835708 3836957 Oh, fuck!
3837458 3840457 - I'm sorry.<br />- That's okay.
3842583 3844582 I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?
3845291 3847374 I'm gonna have to cut the belt.
3848625 3850249 It's okay, it's okay.
3850250 3852790 It's okay. It's okay.<br />Okay, we're gonna get you out.
3852791 3855124 Everything's gonna be fine. Look at me.
3855125 3857707 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />We're gonna get you out of here.
3857708 3859540 Everything's gonna be fine.
3878583 3879707 Ryan!
3913916 3914999 Pull!
3930583 3931874 It's okay.
3941541 3943665 It's okay. You're gonna be okay.
3943666 3947332 All right. Here we<br />go. It's okay, it's okay.
3947333 3949957 It's all right. I got it now. I got it.
3950583 3952665 Ma'am? Ma'am, can you walk with me?
3952666 3954957 It's cool, it's cool. It's okay.
3955791 3959624 Here we go. All right, you're doing great.<br />You're doing great.
3990291 3993624 The DA wanted me to apologize.<br />He really wanted to be here himself.
3993625 3994915 No, he didn't.
3994916 3996749 If he did his own dirty work,<br />none of us would have jobs.
3996750 3999165 - Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.<br />- Graham Waters.
3999166 4001749 - Thanks for coming in, Detective.<br />- He just pulled into the garage.
4001750 4005040 Great, great. Press conference<br />is in 10 minutes, so we'll make this short.
4005041 4008749 Internal Affairs says this Conklin has<br />two suspicious shootings on his record.
4008750 4011999 Both black men.<br />Both times he was cleared, but only just.
4012000 4014749 Detective Lewis<br />makes black man number three.
4014750 4017540 You know any reason<br />why we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?
4018208 4021999 Well, it's... It's more complicated<br />than we originally thought.
4023875 4028082 We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car<br />that Detective Lewis was driving.
4029625 4030707 Shit!
4032416 4033707 Go down to the garage.
4033708 4035874 Tell him to stay in the car<br />until he hears from me.
4036583 4040082 You found the money in the Mercedes.<br />I thought that wasn't his car.
4040083 4042707 Well, the car's actually registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
4042708 4044665 We haven't been able<br />to get in touch with her, yet.
4044666 4047499 Apparently, she left town this morning.
4048250 4049749 So it wasn't Lewis' car.
4049750 4052040 He may not have even known<br />the money was in it.
4058083 4061165 Do you really think you're gonna be able<br />to make that fly?
4063750 4066749 Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.
4066750 4069499 - These names ring a bell, Detective?<br />- Yeah, vaguely.
4069500 4073124 We have attorneys<br />for this slain police officer
4073125 4074707 camping in our offices.
4074708 4077207 We have his mother<br />and a half a dozen men of the cloth
4077208 4080749 who swear that Lewis<br />was one of the twelve apostles of Christ.
4080750 4083624 We have two black city councilmen<br />and a congresswoman
4083625 4086332 who call on the hour, every hour,<br />demanding to know
4086333 4088582 what the District Attorney<br />intends to do about this.
4088583 4090415 And you want him<br />to walk into that press room
4090416 4093707 and tell them all<br />that the situation is complicated?
4100875 4102415 Give us a minute.
4103708 4105040 No problem.
4113416 4115082 Who knows about the money?
4115583 4117374 You gotta be kidding me.
4117375 4119540 There are only two people in this room.
4121583 4124999 Myself, my partner, Ferguson<br />and Internal Affairs.
4125000 4126707 - Jim Ferguson?<br />- Yeah.
4131916 4134165 Okay. Okay, I guess I don't see a problem.
4134166 4137415 As it wasn't Lewis' car, the money<br />isn't clear evidence of any wrongdoing.
4137416 4140249 And even if it was,<br />we aren't going to prosecute a dead man.
4140250 4142249 Which means<br />the money Internal Affairs is holding
4142250 4144457 can't even be considered evidence.
4144458 4147124 What? You know, you can<br />do this whole dance if you want to,
4147125 4148832 but I'm willing to bet
4148833 4150874 when the coroner's report<br />comes back tomorrow
4150875 4154207 it's going to say that Detective Lewis<br />was coked out of his head.
4155125 4156832 Fucking black people, huh?
4157416 4159790 - What did you just say?<br />- I mean...
4160833 4163040 You know, I know<br />all the sociological reasons
4163041 4166540 why per capita eight times more black men<br />are incarcerated than white men.
4166541 4168249 Schools are a disgrace.
4168250 4170624 Lack of opportunity.<br />Bias in the judicial system.
4170625 4172582 All that stuff. All that stuff!
4172583 4176999 But still, it's gotta get to you,<br />on a gut level as a black man.
4177000 4179999 They just can't keep their hands<br />out of the cookie jar.
4185375 4187290 Of course, you and I know<br />that's not the truth,
4187291 4189415 but that's the way it always plays,<br />doesn't it?
4189416 4193040 And assholes like Lewis just keep<br />feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.
4194375 4196790 What did you say you did for the DA again?
4196791 4198832 You coach ball down in Compton.<br />Am I right?
4198833 4200874 Oh, please, don't do that.
4201125 4203665 Don't act like you know<br />something about me, okay?
4203666 4207832 What do you think those kids need?<br />To make them believe, to give them hope?
4207833 4210415 You think they need another<br />drug-dealing cop
4210416 4213124 or do you think they need<br />a fallen black hero?
4213125 4215332 Why don't you cut through<br />the bullshit, Flanagan,
4215333 4217540 and just tell me what it is you want?
4219875 4223207 The DA's squad loses<br />its lead investigator next month.
4223416 4226749 Rick is quite adamant<br />that his replacement be a person of color.
4226750 4230957 It's a high-profile position, and he wants<br />to send the right message to the community.
4230958 4234874 And the right message is,<br />"Look at this black boy I just bought?"
4234875 4238374 Well, fuck you very much,<br />but thanks for thinking of me.
4239833 4241790 Actually, we were thinking of you.
4243416 4244790 Until we saw that.
4246583 4248582 It's your brother's file.
4248583 4251165 Twenty something years old<br />and already three felonies.
4251166 4254082 Three-strikes law. Kid's going<br />away for life for stealing a car.
4254083 4255624 Christ, that's a shitty law.
4256916 4258624 There's a warrant in there.
4258625 4262290 But still, hey,<br />he had every opportunity you had.
4265750 4267749 Fucking black people, huh?
4272833 4274040 So all...
4275083 4279415 All I need to do to make this disappear<br />is to frame a potentially innocent man?
4279416 4282415 What are you?<br />The fucking defender of all things white?
4282416 4286165 We're talking about a white man<br />who shot three black men.
4286166 4289540 And you're arguing with me<br />that maybe we're not being fair to him?
4290875 4292749 You know what? Maybe you're right.<br />Maybe you're right.
4292750 4293957 Maybe Lewis did provoke this
4293958 4296165 and maybe he got exactly<br />what was coming to him.
4296666 4299624 Or maybe, stoned or not,<br />just being a black man in the Valley
4299625 4301624 was enough to get him killed.
4302791 4305790 There was no one there to see<br />who shot first, so there is no way to know.
4305791 4308790 Which means we could get this wrong.
4311625 4314832 Maybe that's what happened<br />with your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.
4314833 4318249 Maybe Lewis isn't the only one<br />who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
4319791 4323290 You're the one closest to all this.<br />You need to tell us.
4327416 4329499 What does your gut tell you?
4343083 4345582 So, Graham.
4345958 4347707 What do I tell them?
4348000 4350707 You tell me, and I'll tell them.
4358750 4361957 Well, I think given<br />Detective Conklin's history,
4362958 4365249 it's pretty clear what happened last night.
4366750 4367832 Okay.
4385541 4387707 <i>Before I get to why we're here,</i>
4387708 4391374 <i>I know that many of you have heard<br />that we had our car stolen last night.</i>
4391750 4396249 <i>And as you could imagine,<br />my wife and I are both pretty shaken up.</i>
4396250 4398124 <i>But we're okay.</i>
4398125 4401790 <i>And Jean and I truly appreciate<br />all your calls and your concern.</i>
4401791 4403082 <i>Thank you.</i>
4403083 4407040 <i>Now, just after 9:00 p. m. last night,</i>
4407208 4409832 <i>Detective William Lewis,<br />an eight-year veteran of the force</i>
4409833 4411707 <i>and an active member<br />of the black community,</i>
4411708 4413582 <i>was gunned down by a fellow officer.</i>
4429541 4430915 Hi, sweetie.
4433791 4435207 Bye, Lara.
4474541 4475790 Get out of the car!

4502791 4504499 Come on, stop! Let's go!
4504500 4506415 - Shit, here comes the po-po.<br />- Shit.
4506416 4507874 - Get off of me.<br />- Fuck off.
4507875 4510582 - Jesus.<br />- Hey, hey. Where you going, man?
4510583 4511749 Hell, no!
4511750 4513707 - Oh, shit.<br />- Anthony! Anthony!
4516416 4518249 Get the fuck out of my car!
4518250 4519665 Shit! Damn!
4519666 4521582 What are you doing, man?<br />Get out of the car!
4521583 4522665 Fuck you!
4522666 4525374 - Get the fuck out of my car!<br />- You get the fuck out of the car!
4525375 4529040 Unit 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.<br />Westbound on...
4529833 4532207 I will blow you away. Get the fuck out!
4535916 4538707 2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...
4538916 4540249 Oh, Christ!
4545291 4547957 - Get the fuck out of the car!<br />- You get the fuck out of the car!
4547958 4550457 - Get out of the fucking car!<br />- It's my fucking car!
4550458 4552540 - It's my fucking gun!<br />- Fuck, it's my gun now!
4552541 4554040 You just give me my fucking gun!
4562500 4563540 Fuck!
4566916 4569582 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4573083 4576207 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4579791 4582582 Slowly step out of the vehicle.
4582583 4584290 Get out of my car.
4584291 4586707 Oh, you so brave, you get out the car, man.
4589416 4592624 Turn off the engine.<br />Throw the keys out the window.
4605916 4608749 You fucking want me?<br />Here I am, you pig fuck!
4608750 4610915 Lie face down on the ground.<br />Spread your arms and legs.
4610916 4613415 No, you lie face down on the ground<br />and spread your arms and legs.
4613416 4615207 Don't come any closer!<br />Down on your knees!
4615208 4616749 Fuck you, man! What are you gonna do?
4616750 4618999 - Pull the fucking trigger, then!<br />- On your knees now!
4619000 4620124 You get on your knees
4620125 4622290 and suck my motherfucking dick<br />while you down there.
4622291 4624249 Do I look like I'm fucking joking with you?
4624250 4626415 Yeah, that's what you look like,<br />a fucking joke to me.
4626416 4628832 - This man is making threatening gestures.<br />- Threatening gestures?
4628833 4631874 You wanna see a threatening gesture?<br />I got a threatening gesture for you.
4631875 4634790 - I know this man! I know this man!<br />- Get back.
4634791 4636540 Fuck off. Give me some space.<br />I know this guy.
4636541 4638165 - Get out of the way.<br />- You don't fucking know me.
4638166 4639374 Step away.
4639375 4641540 Give me some goddamn room.<br />I know this guy.
4642833 4645457 - Man, don't walk up on me!<br />- See what's happening here?
4645458 4647915 Do you wanna die here, huh?<br />Is that what you want?
4647916 4649915 'Cause these guys really wanna shoot you.
4649916 4652790 And the way you're acting,<br />they'll be completely fucking justified.
4652791 4654624 - Fuck you!<br />- Fuck me? Fuck me?
4654625 4656999 I'm not the one who's fucked here.<br />You're the one who's fucked here.
4657000 4658749 'Cause you're the one whose head's<br />gonna be blown off
4658750 4660124 and onto that man's patio.
4660125 4662624 - Officer Hanson, step away.<br />- He's a friend of mine, okay?
4662625 4665290 He's a fucking friend of mine!<br />This man is not armed!
4665291 4668040 He's not gonna shoot you, or me,<br />or anybody else, all right?
4668041 4670582 So give me two goddamn seconds.<br />Can you do that?
4670583 4673207 Lower your firearm! Lower your firearm!
4678583 4680915 Are you starting<br />to understand the situation?
4681916 4683665 What do you want from me?
4684958 4686582 Unless you think your wife
4686583 4689582 is gonna be better off with a husband<br />who has a bloody stump for a head,
4689583 4691832 I want you to sit down on that curb,<br />put your hands on your head,
4691833 4693832 and do nothing<br />until I speak with these officers.
4693833 4697332 I'm not sitting on no curb. I'm not putting<br />my hands on my head for nobody.
4697333 4698790 Then stand right where you are
4698791 4701707 and keep your hands in plain sight.<br />Can you do that, huh?
4704375 4706207 Yeah, I can do that.
4706500 4707582 Good.
4708833 4712207 I told this man to stay where he is<br />and keep his hands in plain sight.
4712625 4717040 This man better be related to you by blood<br />because this is fucking nuts.
4717416 4719040 I need this favor.
4719250 4723124 You can check the guy's name, his license.<br />He's got no priors, no warrants.
4723458 4725415 I need to let him go with a warning.
4726541 4730457 - What kind of fucking warning?<br />- A harsh warning.
4733916 4735374 Thank you.
4738666 4740540 You've been warned.<br />Do you understand me?
4741416 4743040 Do you understand me?
4743041 4745915 You want something from me?<br />'Cause I'm right here.
4746625 4750415 - Look, I'm trying to help you.<br />- I didn't ask for your help, did I?
4752416 4753624 Go home.
4758208 4759915 Yeah, that I can do.
4839375 4840707 Look at me.
4842416 4843999 You embarrass me.
4845375 4847207 You embarrass yourself.
4890250 4891665 Daddy's home!
4911916 4913540 - What's up?<br />- Give me my money!
4913541 4915790 - What? What money?<br />- Daddy!
4915791 4919457 - To pay for my store. Give me my money!<br />- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!
4919458 4920957 - You give me my money.<br />- Daddy.
4922083 4924290 I want my fucking money!<br />Give me that truck.
4924291 4925790 That's not my truck, bro.
4925791 4927582 - Daddy?<br />- Elizabeth!
4927583 4928915 Hey, hey, hey. You okay?
4928916 4932082 You know what? Hey, I got $50. Here, here.
4932083 4934332 $50? You took everything!
4934333 4935457 Mommy?
4937041 4939040 I'm coming, I'm coming.
4939041 4942832 - He doesn't have it.<br />- Hasn't got what?
4943250 4946415 I have it. He doesn't have<br />the impenetrable cloak.
4948500 4950165 Lara, stay out of the street!
4977375 4978999 It's okay, Daddy.
4980416 4982999 - What? What?<br />- I'll protect you.
5009666 5011540 It's okay. Daddy's okay.
5013958 5016374 - It's a really good cloak.<br />- Good.
5096791 5098290 How's it going?
5124375 5128040 I sent her out for groceries,<br />and that was two hours ago, Carol.
5129458 5131707 Well, you know what? You are one to talk.
5131708 5134374 You go through, like,<br />six housekeepers a year.
5135666 5138665 I'm not snapping at you. I am angry.
5140083 5142290 Yes. At them! Yes!
5142291 5146749 At them, the police, at Rick, at Maria,
5146750 5150582 at the dry cleaners<br />who destroyed another blouse today,
5150583 5154457 at the gardener<br />who keeps over-watering the lawn.
5154458 5155499 I...
5156916 5158540 I just thought that...
5159583 5162624 Carol, I just thought that<br />I would wake up today
5163250 5165707 and I would feel better, you know?
5166291 5169290 But I was still mad. And I realized...
5170375 5174165 I realized that it had nothing to do<br />with my car being stolen.
5176333 5178707 I wake up like this every morning.
5180250 5184082 I am angry all the time,<br />and I don't know why.
5184083 5186457 Carol, I don't know why. And I...
5189166 5191165 Yeah, yeah, call me back.
5192416 5193499 Bye.
5305125 5306874 I really appreciate this.
5307708 5309040 No problem.
5315166 5317957 So how long you been out there tonight?<br />It's cold.
5317958 5319332 Hour, maybe.
5320125 5321832 Big surprise, huh?
5321833 5324749 Yeah, this ain't exactly<br />pick-up-a-brother territory.
5325333 5326374 True.
5327875 5331415 - So where you headed?<br />- Anywhere the other side of the hill.
5332125 5333832 I'm going to El Segundo.
5333833 5335249 El Segundo's cool.
5336083 5338707 - You've been there?<br />- Fuck, no.
5345666 5347207 That's some good music.
5350416 5352832 No, really. I'm starting to understand it.
5354083 5357124 Wrote me a country song myself<br />just yesterday.
5357125 5359082 I'll bet you did.
5360333 5361582 Whatever.
5376500 5379082 So what was going on<br />in the Valley tonight?
5379083 5380499 Ice-skating.
5381750 5383332 Ice-skating.
5383333 5385082 Love the ice-skating, man.
5385541 5388874 You know, when I was a kid,<br />I always wanted to be a goalie.
5389833 5391124 Come on.
5391916 5394749 What, you think that's funny or something?
5394750 5396915 I think you're having fun.
5396916 5398415 Yeah. Whatever.
5408583 5411374 - Something else funny?<br />- Oh, yeah.
5413708 5415374 Yeah? What's that?
5416083 5417874 People, man. People.
5419291 5420957 People like me.
5422250 5424540 No, no, no. I'm not laughing at you, man.
5425916 5428915 Yeah, I can see that.<br />Why don't you laugh outside?
5428916 5431124 Dawg, why are you getting<br />all bent out of shape?
5431125 5433790 I'm not getting bent, man.<br />I'm just pulling over.
5436750 5440124 Come on, man, keep driving.<br />I said I'm not laughing at you.
5440125 5442915 And I'm not telling you<br />to get the fuck out of my car.
5442916 5445249 Why you being a fucking jerk, man?<br />Just drive the car.
5445250 5447207 I've got a better idea. Get out now.
5447208 5449082 Fine. You want me to show you?<br />I'll show you.
5449083 5451540 Get your hands out of your pocket.<br />Put your hands where I can see them.
5451541 5452790 Who the fuck you think you're talking to?
5452791 5453999 Put your hands where I can see them.
5454000 5457332 You wanna see what's in my hands?<br />I'll show you what's in my fucking hands.
5482083 5483374 Oh, God.
5492833 5494040 Oh, God.
5529791 5531624 <i>Thank you, brother Merle, for that.</i>
5531625 5536165 <i>That was Merle Haggard here on KYHA,<br />the scene of country music here in LA.</i>
5536458 5538999 <i>It's a cold night, and it's getting colder.</i>
5539000 5542249 <i>And we're giving out tickets to the rodeo<br />coming to the Fairplex in Pomona,</i>
5542250 5543374 <i>so give us a call...</i>
5546750 5550374 - Hey, you okay?<br />- I'm freezing.
5550791 5553665 Shit. I heard it might snow.
5553666 5556249 - Get out of here.<br />- That's what I heard.
5556250 5558707 - You got a smoke?<br />- No. I quit.
5559416 5560915 Yeah, me, too.
5562208 5564332 - What do you got?<br />- Dead kid.
5567250 5568707 Hey, Bob.
5657208 5660415 Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!
5660416 5663249 - Choi Jin Gui! Choi Jin Gui!<br />- Do you speak English?
5663250 5667374 I am speaking English, you stupid cow!<br />My husband name Choi Jin Gui!
5669208 5670790 - Jin Gui!<br />- Ma'am!
5672083 5673249 Kim Lee.
5680000 5683749 I thought you were dead.<br />I called every hospital.
5684250 5686207 It's okay. I'm okay.
5686666 5690165 I went crazy speeding. I drove into a car.
5690416 5692624 Oh, my God. Are you okay?
5692625 5696082 Got into big fight with poor woman.<br />I called her names.
5698041 5701207 Oh, fine. I die from worry and you laugh.
5705083 5707040 Thank you for finding me.
5710125 5713790 - Will you do something for me?<br />- Anything.
5713791 5715374 Go to the locker.
5719708 5721207 No, next one.
5724333 5726874 In my wallet there's a check.
5727416 5728624 Bring it here.
5738041 5741249 Oh, I get it. When I said<br />get me a black Lincoln Navigator,
5741250 5744457 you thought I said<br />get me a white piece-of-shit panel van.
5744458 5747790 Fine, it's fine.<br />Just give me whatever for it, man.
5748291 5750040 You should see this.
5766208 5767832 I'll take the van.
5768583 5770332 They're chained to the van.
5770333 5771874 So I'll take them, too.
5773333 5774999 You wanna buy these Chinamen?
5775000 5777415 Don't be ignorant.<br />They're Thai or Cambodian.
5777416 5779582 Entirely different kind of chinks.
5779583 5783040 - What the hell are you gonna do with them?<br />- Sell them. What the hell do you think?
5783041 5786582 I'll give you $500 apiece,<br />and you can keep the van.
5805791 5807749 Oh, no!
5811916 5813874 No! No!
5830875 5832165 This is Dorri.
5845083 5847999 My baby. My poor baby.
5851083 5852207 Mom.
5853791 5858457 I promise you. I promise<br />I'm gonna find out who did this, Mom.
5860291 5862665 Oh, I already know.
5865791 5866999 You did.
5869083 5872499 I asked you to find your brother,<br />but you were busy.
5873916 5876832 We weren't much good to you anymore,<br />were we?
5882041 5885540 You got things to do.<br />You go ahead. I'll sign the papers.
5885541 5886999 Mom, I wanna stay with...
5887000 5889999 I just wanna wait with my baby.
5901666 5904249 He came home. Did you know that?
5905958 5907707 My little boy.
5908583 5912040 When I was sleeping,<br />he brought me groceries.
5913250 5915207 It's the last thing he did.
5940833 5941915 Baba.
5954875 5956332 What happened?
5963375 5964915 What did you do?
5966416 5968040 Baba, what did you do?
5971666 5973499 I shoot a little girl.
5974000 5975040 What?
5975375 5977915 No, she's okay. She's...
5980000 5982040 She's... Here.
5982500 5984290 The gun shoot her,
5986041 5988540 but she's okay, Dorri. Nothing happened.
5992250 5993540 She's my farishte.
5995416 5998332 - What are you talking about, Daddy?<br />- My farishte, Dorri.
6000666 6001874 My angel.
6004750 6005999 My angel.
6008375 6010207 She came to protect me.
6012333 6013790 To protect us.
6016333 6017749 You understand?
6023083 6024707 Take this. Please.
6026291 6027499 Take it.
6032458 6033790 Hey, hey.
6035333 6037332 Everything is okay, Dorri.
6038916 6040207 It's okay.
6045541 6047874 - Okay, Daddy.<br />- Okay.
6072250 6073582 Jean?
6073583 6075707 <i>- Rick?<br />- Yeah. What's wrong?</i>
6076375 6078040 I fell down the stairs.
6078583 6081499 <i>- Are you all right?<br />- I tried calling you.</i>
6082166 6084415 I couldn't get through to anyone. Not...
6085000 6088165 Not Kath, not Marge, not Julie, not...
6088166 6091249 <i>I'm getting in the elevator. I'll be in<br />my car. I'll be home in 20 minutes.</i>
6091250 6094540 It's okay. Maria drove me to emergency.<br />It's just a bad sprain.
6095000 6097540 <i>Carol was the only one that was home</i>
6097541 6101040 and she said she couldn't come get me<br />because she was getting a massage.
6101041 6103165 Well, that's because she's a bitch.
6103708 6105790 She's been my friend for 10 years.
6107083 6108957 <i>All right, honey. Feel better.</i>
6109791 6111457 I'll be there soon.
6114250 6115540 I love you.
6116416 6117957 I love you, too.
6150916 6152207 Miss Jean.
6154416 6156374 Would you like to sit up?
6162458 6163499 Here.
6164250 6165332 Good.
6174666 6178124 - Do you want to hear something funny?<br />- What, Mrs. Jean?
6180541 6182832 You're the best friend I've got.
6376125 6377124 Hi.

6541583 6543457 Dopey fucking Chinaman.
6579500 6582374 Oh, my God!<br />What the hell is wrong with you people?
6584750 6587374 Don't talk to me,<br />unless you speak American!
