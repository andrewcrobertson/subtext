169466 171204 It's the sense of touch.
173089 174214 What?
176725 178775 Any real city, you walk,
179750 180430 you know?
180708 182918 You brush past people.<br />People bump into you.
184602 186728 In I.A., nobody touches you.
190326 192591 We're always behind<br />this metal and glass.
195133 197423 I think we miss that touch so much
198114 201364 that we crash into each other<br />just so we can feel something.
203786 205034 You guys ok?
206206 207953 I think he hit his head.
208917 210605 You don't think that's true?
211211 212459 Stay in your car.
213213 214224 Graham,
214498 216089 I think we got rear-ended.
216409 218362 I think we spun around twice.
218524 222095 And somewhere in there,<br />one of us lost our frame of reference.
223306 225156 And I'm gonna go look for it.
228144 229418 Calm down, ma'am.
229420 230606 I am calm!
230772 233037 I need to see your registration<br />and insurance.
233039 234421 Why? It's not my fault!
234423 235336 It's her fault!
235356 236257 She do this!
236259 236984 My fault?
236986 239186 Ma'am, you really need to wait<br />in your vehicle.
239188 241214 My fault?<br />Stop in middle of street!
241488 242902 Mexicans no know how to drive.
242955 244173 She blake too fast.
244678 245947 I blake too fast?
246313 247585 I blake too fast.
247622 250214 I'm sorry you no see my blake light.
250216 250808 Ma'am.
250824 254378 See, I stop when I see a long line<br />of cars stopped in front of me.
254596 257341 Maybe you see over steering wheel,<br />you blake too!
257536 258507 Ma'am!<br />Crazy Mexican.
258509 260639 I call immigration on you.<br />Look what you do my car.
260832 262676 Officer, can you please write down<br />in your report,
262678 264798 how shocked I am to be hit<br />by an Asian driver.
264800 265371 Ma'am!
265373 266466 Ma'am, no. See.
266693 267703 Detective.
268233 269703 I don't care you cop!
269863 271043 You wanna see insurance!
271797 272960 Look what you do to my car!<br />Alright.

274345 275432 You fuck you too!<br />Calm down!
275901 276854 Fuck you too!
277178 278814 Stupid wetback blake my car...
283700 285099 Hey, Detective.
285304 287179 Nice entrance.<br />Fuck you.
290895 291449 Hey?
292337 293024 You ok?
293834 294895 I'm freezing.
295098 295781 Shit.
296784 298051 I heard it might snow.
298176 299186 Get out of here.
299188 300261 That's what I heard.
300827 301665 You got a smoke?
301712 303045 No. I quit.
303907 305036 Yeah, me too.
306514 307610 What do you got?
308392 309377 Dead kid.
319099 319824 Hey, Bob.
362556 364335 You get one free box of ammunition.
364337 365281 What kind do you want?
378270 379462 Yo, Osama!
379837 381449 Plan a Jihad on your own time.
381451 382386 What do you want?
384075 385231 What he is saying about Jihad?
387136 388557 Are you making insult at me?
388559 390015 Am I making insult at you?
390163 391430 Is that the closest<br />you can come to English?
391432 392703 Yes, I speak English!
392720 393803 I am American citizen.
393805 394672 Oh, God, here we go.
394674 395805 I have right like you.
395807 397831 I have right to buy gun.<br />Not in my store, you don't.
397833 400249 Andy, get him out of here now!<br />Dad, go wait in the car.
400350 401241 Now. Get out!
402827 403878 You're an ignorant man!
403880 406037 Oh, yeah, I'm ignorant?<br />You're liberating my country
406039 408343 and I'm flying 747s into your mud huts
408345 409428 and incinerating your friends?
409430 411324 Get the fuck out of my store!<br />No, you get the fuck!
411326 412493 Now, come on.<br />Get out!
412495 414257 No, don't touch me!<br />He cheat me this man!
414264 416033 Andy, now!<br />Come on, let's go.
416065 417718 Go wait in the car. Ok.
417720 418854 I go to wait in the car.
421430 423963 You can give me the gun<br />or give me back the money.
424066 426268 And I am really hoping for the money.
432109 434694 What kind of ammunition do you want?<br />Whatever fits.
434696 436182 Oh, we got a lot of kinds.
436934 439269 We got long colts, short colts,<br />ball heads,
439271 441917 flat nose, hollow points, wide cutters,
441919 444087 and a dozen more that'll fit any size hole.
445319 446536 Just depends upon,
446538 448865 how much bang you can handle.
452137 453887 I'll take the ones in the red box.
456747 457968 You know what those are?
457970 459294 Can I have them?
469113 470656 Did you see any white people in there
470678 473133 waiting an hour and 32 minutes<br />for a plate of spaghetti?
473556 475223 And how many cups<br />of coffee did we get?
475308 477820 You don't drink coffee,<br />and I didn't want any.
478154 480228 Man, that woman in there<br />poured cup after cup
480271 482214 to every single white person around us,
482230 484307 but did she even ask you<br />if you wanted any?
484843 487357 We didn't get any coffee<br />that you didn't want and I didn't order,
487359 489567 and that's evidence<br />of racial discrimination?
489739 491615 Did you notice that<br />our waitress was black?
491699 493971 And black women<br />don't think in stereotypes?
494200 495242 You tell me something, man.
495244 497830 When was the last time you met one<br />who didn't think she knew everything
497832 500497 about your little lazy ass, before<br />you even opened your mouth.
501318 503201 That waitress sized us up<br />in two seconds.
503295 505346 We're black and black people don't tip.
505348 507006 So she wasn't gonna waste her time.
507245 508553 Now, somebody like that,
508555 510301 nothing you can do<br />to change their mind.
510384 512231 Yeah well, how much did you leave?
512911 514892 You expect me to pay<br />for that kind of service?
515810 516443 What?
517204 518700 What the fuck<br />is you laughing at, man?
519614 522697 I'm seriously starting to think<br />that you're jealous of Karen.
522699 523380 Hardly.
523506 525364 I'd just like to see you<br />get through a meal without
525366 526874 calling her or anyone<br />else for that matter.
526876 529425 Ok look, no more phone calls tonight.<br />Alright, it's my fault.
529427 531047 Here, you can hold the battery.
531447 532022 Ok?
534867 536746 $10 says she calls you in the car.
537370 538581 Wait, wait, wait.
538999 540122 You see what that<br />woman just did?
540340 542206 You see that?<br />Why, she's cold.
542208 544318 She got colder as soon as<br />she saw us, dawg.
545461 547229 Oh, man, come on, don't start.
547231 548538 Man, look around you, man.
548912 552300 You couldn't find a whiter, safer<br />or better-lit part of this city right now.
552478 554698 But yet this white woman<br />sees two black guys
554700 557508 who look like UCLA students<br />strolling down the sidewalk,
557510 559356 and her reaction is blind fear?
559892 562435 I mean look at us, dawg.<br />Are we dressed like gangbangers?
563227 563946 No.
563948 565075 Do we look threatening?
565421 565976 No.
566031 568377 Fact. If anybody should<br />be scared around here,
568805 569736 it's us.
569944 574165 We're the only two black faces surrounded<br />by a sea of over-caffeinated white people
574167 576491 patrolled by the trigger-happy LAPD.
576534 577790 So you tell me.
578276 579550 Why aren't we scared?
580623 581783 Because we got guns?
582794 583882 You could be right.
587461 588839 Get the fuck out of the car!
589106 589821 Give me the keys!
589823 591714 Come on. Hurry up!<br />Ok, ok, ok, ok.
591716 592757 Get down!
592842 594675 No, no! No, no! Please!<br />Don't look at me!
594677 596343 Motherfuck, I said don't look at me.
596345 597305 Turn around!
597667 598677 Come on, go!
598679 600418 We're good. We're fine.<br />Just keep moving.
606022 610081 No, no, no! Take that voodoo-ass thing<br />off of there right now.
610109 612336 I know you just didn't call<br />Saint Christopher voodoo.
612695 614738 Man's the patron saint of travelers, dawg.
614822 616439 You had a conversation with God?
616518 617527 What did God say?
617615 618824 Go forth, my son,
618826 622226 and leave big slobbery suction rings<br />on every dashboard you find?
622455 623747 Why the hell do you do that?
623831 626499 Look at the way your crazy ass drive,<br />then ask me again.
634075 636577 Chevy pickup and Mercedes<br />driving north on Balboa.
636875 639605 Pickup cuts in front. Driver of<br />the Mercedes gets pissed, pulls a gun.
639607 641848 Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup<br />is a cop coming off shift.
641891 644100 Wait a minute,<br />this Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
644185 645415 Yeah. Name's Conklin.
645580 646896 He's a narc out of Wilshire.
646937 648445 I got the Mercedes.
649677 651106 Mercedes takes a shot at him.
651108 653064 Detective Conklin returns fire.<br />One shot.
653069 655968 Mercedes rolls to a stop.<br />Driver opens the door, falls out dead.
657442 659923 He looks very relaxed<br />for just having shot somebody.
660249 661875 He says he kept trying to drive away.
661976 664411 The Mercedes kept pulling up<br />next to him, screaming, waving a gun.
664413 666018 Shot back in self-defense.
666874 669162 Anybody actually see who shot first?
669164 670669 They just heard two bangs.
671337 672661 Find me a witness.
686852 689270 That is a nice gun.
689855 693650 Well, the car's registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
694594 696020 And that's not Cindy.
696654 699698 That is a William Lewis.
699782 701509 Found it under the front seat.
701784 703100 Hollywood Division.
707096 710361 Looks like Detective Conklin shot<br />himself the wrong nigger.
722480 723761 How much longer are you gonna be?
723907 725303 This is the last one.
725599 726704 Thank you.
735848 738800 You don't think reporters<br />listen to police calls?
739196 740894 I need to talk to you for a second.
742447 743745 You just give me a minute, alright?
744864 746361 And find Flanagan, will you?
746643 747678 Now.<br />Yes, sir.
749540 750550 Yes, honey?
751013 752505 I want the locks changed again<br />in the morning.
752668 753450 You want...
753753 755551 Look, why don't<br />you just go lie down?
755585 756570 Have you checked on James?
756601 758130 Well, of course I've checked on James.
758132 760079 I've checked on him every five minutes<br />since we've been home.
760081 761252 Do not patronize me.
761579 761875 I'm...
761886 764587 I want the locks changed again<br />in the morning.
764821 766001 It's ok.
766239 767771 Just go to bed, alright.
767773 770859 You know what, didn't I just ask you<br />not to treat me like a child?
770887 772363 I'm sorry, Miss Jean.
774201 775534 Is ok I go home now?
775565 777327 It's fine.<br />Thank you very much for staying, Maria.
777359 778442 You're welcome. No problem.
778444 779611 Good night, Miss Jean.<br />Good night.
779695 780775 We'll see you tomorrow.
782133 784932 I would like the locks changed again,
784974 785866 in the morning.
785868 786906 And you know what?
786908 788642 You might mention<br />that we'd appreciate it
788644 790516 if next time they didn't send<br />a gang member.
790518 791789 A gang member?<br />Yes, yes.
791906 793124 What, you mean that kid in there?<br />Yes.
793209 794604 The guy in there with the shaved head,
794606 796030 the pants around his ass,<br />Oh come on.
796108 797709 The prison tattoo.<br />Those are not prison tattoos.
797711 799601 Oh, really?<br />And he's not gonna go sell our key
799632 801938 to one of his gangbanger friends<br />the moment he is out our door?
801940 803268 We've had a really tough night.
803270 805344 I think it'd be best<br />if you just went upstairs right now...
805346 806888 And, what?<br />Wait for them to break in?
806931 810338 I just had a gun pointed in my face.
810340 811350 You lower your voice!
811352 814145 And it was my fault<br />because I knew it was gonna happen.
814357 817148 But if a white person sees<br />two black men walking towards her,
817233 819216 and she turns and walks<br />in the other direction,
819218 820653 she's a racist, right?
820736 823482 Well, I got scared<br />and I didn't say anything.
823484 826086 And ten seconds later<br />I had a gun in my face!
826156 827200 Now, I am telling you.
827243 828328 Your amigo in there,
828330 830079 is gonna sell our key<br />to one of his homies.
830081 834397 And this time it'd be really fucking great<br />if you acted like you actually gave a shit!
862319 864320 Alright, what have we got?<br />Talk to me, Karen.
864595 866364 Flanagan doesn't think<br />anybody has the story yet.
866448 869117 I'm the goddamn District Attorney<br />of Los Angeles.
869159 871763 If my car gets jacked,<br />it's gonna make news.
872580 873576 Fuck!
875916 877917 Why did these guys have to be black?
878137 879262 I mean, why?
879956 881540 No matter how we spin this thing,
881663 884506 I'm either gonna lose the black vote<br />or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
884508 886009 You know, I think you're worrying<br />too much.
886093 887885 You have a lot of support<br />in the black community.
889805 892807 Alright. If we can't duck this thing,<br />we're gonna have to neutralize it.
892850 894416 What we need is a picture,
894418 895225 of me,
895546 896586 pinning a medal,
896588 897458 on a black man.
897897 898748 Bruce?
901097 902062 The firefighter.
902064 903914 The one who saved<br />the camp or something.
903953 905297 Northridge.<br />What's his name?
905446 906555 He's Iraqi.
907781 908786 He's Iraqi?
909617 910629 Well, he looks black.
911285 912846 He's dark-skinned sir, but...
912848 914703 he's Iraqi. His name's Saddam Khahum.
914705 915512 Saddam?
915959 917289 His name's Saddam?
917394 919096 Well, that's real good, Bruce.
919098 922336 Yeah, I'm gonna pin a medal<br />on an Iraqi named Saddam.
922338 924245 Give yourself a raise, will you?
927092 929748 It's been good doing business with you.
930679 932028 How soon can I have them?
932030 933933 I'm picking them up right now.
934016 936118 Look, you're not listening to me.
936120 937639 This is an emergency.
937764 940185 I keep telling you he's in pain.<br />He can't sleep.
940256 941263 Mr. Ryan,
941339 944709 your father has been to the clinic<br />three times in the last month.
944828 947807 He is being treated<br />for a urinary tract infection.
947809 950031 That is by no means an emergency.
950449 953744 Now, if you have any more questions<br />about your HMO plan,
954046 956876 why don't you make an appointment<br />to come in between 10:00 and 4:00,
956878 958053 Monday through Friday?
958055 960257 What does my father do<br />about sleeping tonight?
960259 962255 I don't know.<br />I'm not a doctor.
962257 965090 I wanna talk to your supervisor.<br />I am my supervisor.
965092 967422 Yeah, what is your name?<br />Shaniqua Johnson.
967675 969968 Shaniqua.<br />Big fucking surprise that is.
986193 988817 <i>1005 Bronson Avenue, Westwood.</i>
988819 991636 <i>Vehicle described as a black,<br />late-model Lincoln Navigator.</i>
991706 995910 <i>California plates,<br />4 Peter Charles lda 315.</i>
996147 999080 <i>Suspects are two black males,<br />approximately 20 years of age.</i>
1007820 1008756 That's not it.
1010134 1012575 That's not the vehicle, John.<br />The plates don't match.
1012646 1015860 The driver's got to be 40, and nobody<br />jacks a car and takes it to Studio City.
1021645 1023169 They were doing something.
1067649 1069108 Enthusiastic.
1070736 1072776 Keep your hands<br />where I can see them, please.
1073822 1076783 I'm gonna need to see<br />your driver's license and registration.
1077326 1078596 No problem.
1078838 1080150 I'm gonna have to...
1080368 1082997 reach inside of the glove compartment<br />to get the registration.
1083144 1083950 Is that ok?
1083952 1085198 Nice and slow, please.
1085388 1086195 Ok.
1091673 1093341 How are you tonight, Officer?
1094176 1095110 Excellent.
1097061 1098520 Here you go.
1102684 1104127 Stay inside the vehicle, please.
1113529 1115224 Let's do it again right now.
1116828 1118221 Step out of the car, please, sir.
1119542 1122620 Wait, wait, wait a minute, Officer.<br />I haven't been drinking or anything.
1122704 1124288 Then we should not have a problem.
1124373 1126858 He doesn't drink.<br />He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.
1127376 1129001 No, it's ok.
1129461 1130435 It's fine.
1136009 1137739 Step onto the sidewalk, sir.
1139588 1141034 That's good. Right there.
1143600 1144519 Look at me.
1146145 1147948 I want you to stand on your right foot.
1148438 1151158 Touch your nose<br />with the index finger of your left hand.
1156780 1158823 I told you he doesn't drink.
1158907 1162048 Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you one time<br />to stay in the vehicle.
1162411 1163728 Ma'am?<br />Honey.
1163730 1165301 Honey, I'm ok. I got this.
1165303 1166122 Don't you ma'am me.
1166206 1167719 Who the hell do you think<br />you're talking to?
1168250 1169359 Look Officer...
1170198 1171885 my wife has had a couple of drinks.<br />Alright.
1171887 1172919 Both of you turn around.
1172921 1175022 Put your hands on top of your head<br />and interlock your fingers.
1175024 1175745 No, wait. Wait.
1175747 1178537 We're only a block away from our house.<br />Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
1178678 1180715 That's not even necessary.<br />Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.
1180717 1182141 Look, I'm a television director.
1182895 1184925 Me and my wife were just coming home<br />from an awards show.
1184927 1185946 Get your hands off him.
1185948 1187436 He has done nothing wrong.
1187519 1189296 Put your hands<br />on top of your head, ma'am.
1189353 1190626 Will you just do what he says?
1190628 1191378 Fuck you!
1191384 1193676 Put your hands on top of your head, ma'am.<br />And you keep your filthy fucking hands,
1193678 1194561 off me!
1194927 1196658 You mother fucking pig!
1196660 1198275 Christine, just stop talking.
1198959 1200595 That's quite a mouth you have.
1201450 1202738 Of course you know that.
1202910 1203886 Fuck you!
1204118 1205704 That's what this is all about, isn't it?
1206191 1208335 You thought you saw<br />a white woman blowing a black man,
1208337 1209790 and that just drove<br />your little cracker ass crazy.
1209792 1211557 Will you just shut your fucking mouth!
1211793 1213642 I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.
1214630 1216078 Put your legs open.
1218802 1222277 Now, do you have any guns or knives<br />or anything I might get stuck with?
1222930 1225181 I'm wearing a cocktail dress.<br />What do you think?
1225265 1227609 You'd be surprised some of the places<br />I've found weapons.
1227893 1228927 He's clean.
1230799 1232779 What do you think<br />we should do about this, Mr. Thayer?
1234805 1237966 My partner and I just witnessed your wife<br />performing fellatio on you,
1238350 1240288 while you were operating a motor vehicle.
1240906 1242551 That's reckless endangerment,
1242699 1244743 which, incidentally is a felony.
1246746 1248371 Now we can charge your wife here with
1248640 1251515 lewd conduct<br />and performing a sexual act in public.
1253389 1255019 Now you say you're a block from home.
1257062 1258564 Now, we could use our discretion
1259341 1261300 and let you go with a warning,
1262187 1264339 or we can cuff you<br />and put you in the back of the car.
1267586 1269063 What do you think we should do, sir?
1277818 1279080 Look we're sorry,
1279458 1280208 and...
1281530 1284444 we would appreciate if you<br />would just let us go with a warning,
1284446 1285320 please.
1291059 1292715 The man's apologizing, Tommy.
1294459 1295981 I think we can let him go.
1296600 1297377 Don't you?
1300165 1300750 Yeah.
1301633 1302453 Alright.
1304768 1305701 You can go.
1316213 1317647 You folks drive safe now.
1352267 1353591 Let's go, Tommy.
1362944 1364737 It won't close.
1365739 1367114 I can do that.
1367157 1369033 Dad, you couldn't even get it open.
1369117 1371157 Have respect for your father.<br />Give me the gun.
1372773 1373476 Here.
1373841 1375320 Now you can shoot<br />anybody you want.
1375755 1377849 Dorri, that man could've<br />killed your mother.
1378694 1381394 You think I should let crazy people<br />do what they want to us?
1381932 1383831 Farhad, it won't close.
1388305 1390479 Dorri, you should be at work.
1402859 1404011 Who are you calling?
1404817 1407093 I'm gonna report their asses.<br />Sons of bitches.
1407924 1411259 You actually believe they're gonna take<br />anything you have to say seriously?
1411372 1412905 Do you have any<br />idea how that felt?
1413116 1415172 To have that pig's hands all over me?
1415590 1417154 And you just stood there.
1419459 1421127 And then you apologized to him?
1421288 1422820 I mean, what did you want me to do?
1423303 1424414 Get us both shot?
1424417 1426476 They were gonna shoot us<br />on Ventura Boulevard?
1427300 1428050 Pathetic.
1428051 1431153 Yeah, well, maybe you would have<br />been satisfied with just being arrested.
1431727 1432983 Oh, I get it.
1433612 1437578 Much better to let him shove his hand up<br />my crotch than get your name in the paper.
1438778 1440682 You know, you finally got me figured out,
1440684 1443649 because see, that's exactly<br />what I was worried about, right there.
1443692 1444802 Oh, and it wasn't?
1445049 1447123 You weren't afraid that all your<br />good friends at the studio
1447125 1448639 were gonna read<br />about you in the morning
1448654 1451017 and realize that, you know what,<br />he's actually black?
1452515 1454411 You need to calm down right now.
1454413 1458028 No what I need, is a husband<br />who will not just stand there,
1458176 1459498 while I am being molested!
1459541 1461668 I mean, they were cops,<br />for God's sakes!
1461848 1463044 They had guns!
1464300 1466964 You know what?<br />Maybe I should have let them arrest your ass.
1467048 1471100 I mean, sooner or later you got to find out<br />what it is really like to be black.
1471720 1473888 Fuck you, man.<br />Like you know.
1474329 1476190 The closest you ever came<br />to being black Cameron,
1476192 1477611 was watching The Cosby Show.
1477613 1480771 Yeah, well at least I wasn't watching it<br />with the rest of the equestrian team.
1481136 1483100 Yeah, you're right Cameron.<br />I got a lot to learn
1483345 1485626 because I haven't quite<br />learned how to shuck and jive.
1485775 1486782 Let me hear it again.
1487225 1489085 Thank you, Mr. Policeman.
1489507 1491864 You sure is mighty kind<br />to us poor black folk.
1492239 1495785 You be sure to let me know next time<br />you wanna finger-fuck my wife.
1498149 1500540 How the fuck do you say<br />something like that to me?
1502291 1503541 You know, fuck you!
1505285 1506973 That's good. A little anger.
1507090 1508748 It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!
1558807 1559923 How's it going?
1560089 1560786 Ok.
1562143 1563694 You didn't get scared or something,<br />did you?
1564474 1567126 There's no monsters in the closet, right?<br />Because I hate monsters.
1567607 1569597 There's no such thing as monsters.
1570387 1571460 That's a good thing.
1572283 1573563 I heard a bang.
1574213 1575413 Like a truck bang?
1576396 1577435 Like a gun.
1584708 1585828 That's funny,
1585830 1587963 because we moved out<br />of that bad neighborhood.
1588503 1590412 And there is not too many guns<br />around here.
1592924 1594697 How far can bullets go?
1595343 1596672 They go pretty far.
1597345 1598170 But...
1598274 1600348 they usually get stuck<br />in something and stop.
1603646 1606130 You thinking about that bullet<br />that came through your window?
1609440 1611205 Because we never did find it, did we?
1612027 1614945 I think it didn't see me<br />because I was under the covers.
1617346 1619825 And you think it was that same bullet<br />that you heard tonight?
1623788 1625386 You think we should move again?
1625649 1626654 I like it here.
1626928 1629353 Me, too. But if that bullet found out<br />where we lived...
1630754 1631668 Oh, hold on.
1632330 1633002 What?
1633298 1634870 So stupid!
1634872 1636092 How can I forget?
1636676 1637588 What?
1639846 1641616 No, forget it.<br />You ain't gonna believe me.
1641765 1642647 Tell me.
1644184 1645076 Ok.
1646728 1647929 When I was five,
1648470 1650398 this fairy came into my room one night.
1650440 1651303 Right.
1651566 1653314 See, I told you<br />you weren't gonna believe me.
1653693 1655689 Ok, go to sleep now, you little rat.<br />No, tell me.
1657822 1658655 Ok.
1660287 1662081 So this fairy comes<br />into my room,
1662842 1664746 and I'm like, Yeah, right, you're a fairy.
1665511 1667449 Anyway, we're talking, you know.
1667691 1669346 And she's flying all around the room,
1669348 1671091 knocking down all my posters and stuff.
1671252 1672753 She was flying?
1673003 1674658 Yeah, but she had<br />these little stubby wings.
1674660 1676132 She could've glued them on, you know?
1676216 1677609 Like I'm gonna believe she's a fairy.
1678927 1680224 So she said, I'll prove it.
1680970 1682842 So she reaches into her backpack,
1683390 1684540 and she pulls out this,
1684770 1685809 invisible cloak.
1685965 1687256 She ties it around my neck,
1687799 1689656 and she tells me that it's impenetrable.
1690633 1692030 You know what impenetrable means?
1693162 1694829 It means that nothing can go through it.
1695318 1696873 No bullets. Nothing.
1697435 1699041 She told me that if I wore it,
1699766 1700907 nothing would hurt me.
1701282 1702326 So I did.
1702742 1703578 And...
1704179 1707081 my whole life, I never got shot,<br />stabbed. Nothing.
1707900 1709240 I mean, how weird is that?
1710612 1712257 Only she told me<br />that I was supposed to give it
1712259 1714548 to my daughter on her fifth birthday<br />and I forgot.
1715672 1716860 Can I touch it?
1717716 1718834 Sure, go ahead.
1721302 1722458 I don't feel it.
1722593 1723892 Yeah. It's pretty cool?
1724994 1726974 If you want I can take it off<br />and tie it around your shoulders.
1726976 1728030 She told me how to do it.
1729018 1730738 Unless you think it's stupid then...
1731354 1732608 Don't you need it?
1732992 1734070 No, not anymore.
1735734 1737326 So what do you think, you want it?
1744033 1745714 Ok, let's get out of here.
1752000 1752933 Ok.
1767140 1768276 Hold your chin up.
1774481 1775882 Ok. Is that too tight?
1777025 1778607 Do you feel anything at all?
1780195 1782340 Good. Then it's just right.
1789454 1791371 Do I take it off when I have a bath?
1791414 1793229 No, you leave it on all the time.
1794100 1795482 Until you have a daughter.
1795710 1797189 When she turns five,
1797699 1799069 then you give it to her.
1800049 1800596 Ok?
1801901 1802401 Ok.
1805468 1805929 Ok.
1807722 1808798 Good night, sweetie.
1809370 1810474 Good night.
1851537 1853681 No, no. You wanna listen<br />to music of the oppressor,
1853683 1855135 you go right ahead, man.
1855930 1859231 How in the lunacy of your mind<br />is hip-hop music of the oppressor?
1859274 1860816 Listen to it, man.
1860818 1862360 Nigger this, nigger that.
1862443 1865769 You think white people go around<br />calling each other honkies all day, man?
1865947 1867614 Hey, honky, how's business?
1867657 1869832 Going great, cracker. We're diversifying.
1869993 1870975 How about this?
1871400 1872954 How about that? Listen<br />to that. You like that?
1873138 1874597 Man's singing about lynching niggers.

1908990 1911658 and nobody will be able to understand<br />a fucking word they say.
1911660 1912910 End of problem.
1920710 1922205 What the fuck was that, dawg?
1936726 1938060 Holy shit!
1938519 1940582 What?<br />Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.
1941522 1943607 You're saying there is a Chinaman<br />under this truck?
1943691 1945025 What part don't you understand?
1945109 1947810 There's a Chinaman<br />stuck underneath the fucking truck.
1950031 1951365 Help me.
1953701 1955209 Oh, God.
1955411 1957940 What the hell did he do,<br />just leap out in front of the truck?
1958623 1960791 Man, this is so completely fucked up.
1960876 1963043 Oh, really? No shit!
1963086 1965249 Ok, hold up.<br />Hold up, hold up, hold up.
1966255 1967881 Get back in the truck.<br />What?
1967924 1970634 Yes, get back in the truck.<br />You think we didn't drag him far enough?
1970718 1972269 No, no we gonna drive away.
1972525 1973513 And he gonna let go.
1973554 1975806 He's not gonna let go, Anthony.<br />You know why?
1975890 1978934 Because he's stuck underneath<br />the fucking truck!
1979018 1980227 Now, if he could've let go,
1980269 1983522 he probably would have considered<br />that option about a half a block back.
1983564 1985232 Now, what you and I got to do,
1985234 1987358 just grab his arms<br />and pull him from underneath.
1987360 1989111 You grab his arm, it's gonna fall off.
1989195 1991232 Then you gonna be standing<br />in the middle of the street
1991234 1992654 holding a Chinaman's arm.
1992656 1994015 Then what your ass gonna do?
1994409 1996497 If we leave this man here, he dies.
1997033 1998663 Then we're up for murder charges.
1999122 2000476 Now just grab his arm.
2000478 2001916 Why not just pull him out?
2007630 2009547 I don't wanna cause any problems,<br />Lieutenant.
2009549 2010914 I just want a new partner.
2011006 2013502 I understand.<br />Your partner's a racist prick.
2013553 2015548 But you don't wanna stir up<br />any bad feelings with him.
2015888 2017973 Well, he's been on the force<br />for a long time.
2018057 2019178 Seventeen years.
2019180 2021352 And I do have to work here, sir.
2021894 2022606 So,
2022941 2024522 you don't mind that there<br />is a racist prick on the force.
2024605 2026166 You just don't want him<br />to ride in your car.
2027834 2030077 If you need me to go on record<br />about this sir, I will.
2030486 2031584 That'd be great.
2031586 2032984 Write a full report.
2033404 2035614 Because I'm anxious to understand<br />how an obvious bigot
2035616 2038250 could've gone undetected<br />in this department for 17 years,
2038453 2040749 11 of which he was under<br />my personal supervision,
2041096 2043354 which doesn't speak very highly<br />of my managerial skills.
2043708 2045208 But that's not your concern.
2045210 2046968 I can't wait to read it.
2047712 2050632 What if I said I wanted a new partner<br />for personal reasons?
2051272 2053752 So now you're saying he's not<br />a racist prick, you just don't like him.
2055353 2056142 Yes, sir.
2056144 2057620 That's not a good enough reason.
2058473 2060941 Well then, I guess I should think<br />of a better one and get back to you.
2061100 2062810 So you think<br />I'm asking you to make one up.
2064141 2067430 No, sir. I just can't think<br />of one right now.
2068393 2069660 You wanna know what I heard?
2071778 2074321 I heard it was a case<br />of uncontrollable flatulence.
2074697 2077321 You want me to say he has flatulence?<br />Not him. You.
2077937 2079479 You have uncontrollable flatulence.
2079481 2081202 You're too embarrassed<br />to ride with anybody else,
2081204 2082829 so you're requesting a one-man car.
2082872 2083795 I'm not...
2084398 2085833 comfortable with that, Lieutenant.
2085875 2087066 I would not be either.
2087440 2089294 Which is why I understand<br />your need for privacy.
2089337 2092388 Just like I'm sure you understand<br />how hard a black man has to work to get to,
2092840 2096231 say where I am, in a racist fucking<br />organization like the LAPD
2096552 2098395 and how easily that can be taken away.
2098888 2099667 Now,
2099669 2100821 that being said,
2100823 2101975 it's your decision.
2102282 2104290 You can put your career<br />and mine on the line,
2104690 2106368 in pursuit of a just cause,
2107340 2108914 or you can admit to having an...
2109077 2110441 embarrassing problem,
2111262 2112672 of a personal nature.
2117740 2118652 Fuck.
2149397 2150363 Excuse me.
2151770 2152900 Excuse me. Sir?
2154443 2155585 You finished?
2155587 2156988 I replaced the lock.
2157289 2158993 But you got a real problem<br />with that door.
2160199 2161407 You fix the lock?
2161790 2163286 No, I replaced the lock.
2163786 2164618 But,
2164620 2166264 you got to fix that door.
2166266 2167525 Just fix the lock.
2167579 2168705 Sir, sir, sir.
2168707 2169664 Listen to me.
2169829 2171028 What you need,
2171291 2172712 is a new door.
2173203 2175023 I need new door?<br />Yeah.
2175631 2176513 Ok.
2176926 2178217 How much?
2178843 2179590 I don't...
2180459 2182669 Sir, you're gonna have to call<br />somebody that sells doors.
2182972 2184830 You try to cheat me, right?
2184832 2186642 You have a friend that fix door?
2186828 2188766 No, I don't have a friend<br />that fix doors, bro.
2188768 2191544 Then go and fix the fucking lock,<br />you cheater.
2191647 2192389 You...
2192796 2193816 You know what?
2193900 2195671 Why don't you just pay<br />for the lock and...
2195815 2197111 I won't charge you for the time.
2197153 2200322 You don't fix the lock! I pay?<br />What, you think I'm stupid?
2200406 2202991 You fix the fucking lock, you cheater!
2203316 2205157 Hey, I'd appreciate it<br />if you'd stop calling me names.
2205159 2207786 Then fix the fucking lock!<br />I replaced the lock!
2207788 2209680 You got to fix the fucking door!
2209682 2211891 You cheat! You fucking cheater!
2212673 2213388 Fine.
2213921 2215103 Don't pay.<br />What?
2216088 2217058 Have a good night.
2217060 2218755 What? No. Wait!
2218865 2220530 Wait! You come back here!
2220532 2221761 You fix the lock!
2221919 2223975 Come here! You fix my lock!
2224148 2225685 Fix the fucking lock!
2231395 2232687 No, I understand.
2232772 2234334 You run over a Chinaman,
2234556 2235566 stuff him in the back,
2235791 2238610 then bring the truck here<br />so I can share in the experience.
2238653 2241404 Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.<br />It'll wash right off.
2241600 2243184 Georgie, burn this thing.
2243199 2244856 Burn it? It's a brand-new Navigator.
2244858 2246452 All you need is a little piece of carpet.
2246494 2248422 You watch the Discovery Channel?
2249236 2250111 Not a lot.
2250113 2251832 They got some good shit on that channel.
2252060 2255506 Every night there is a show<br />with somebody shining a little blue light
2255508 2260189 and finding tiny specks of blood splattered<br />on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,
2260191 2264652 bathroom fixtures and special-edition<br />plastic Burger King tray cups.
2265096 2268403 Then the next thing they show<br />is some stupid redneck in handcuffs
2268405 2272116 who looks absolutely stunned<br />that this is happening to him.
2272353 2275942 Sometimes the redneck is actually<br />watching the Discovery Channel
2275944 2277820 when they break in to arrest him.
2277858 2281927 And he still can't figure out<br />how on earth they could've caught him!
2291216 2294029 Do I look like I wanna be<br />on the Discovery Channel?
2295715 2298002 No.<br />Then get the fuck out of my shop.
2302240 2304100 Oh, yeah, make sure you get that.
2304655 2307342 Without him, things could've gone<br />really fucking wrong tonight.
2309015 2309832 Fuck!
2309887 2311289 Don't. Don't!
2311291 2312881 Could you please...<br />Don't you dare.
2313227 2313874 Don't!
2315256 2316260 Graham Waters.
2318024 2318725 No.
2319904 2321390 No, he's not here, Ma.
2321736 2323054 It's your mother?
2323738 2325416 I'm not gonna go looking for him.
2326851 2329264 Look, he'll be home when he...<br />Just leave it alone, Ma.
2330036 2333059 Ma, I can't talk to you right now, ok?<br />I'm having sex with a white woman.
2334367 2334867 Ok.
2335264 2336302 Ok, where were we?
2337793 2340587 I was white and you were about<br />to jerk off in the shower.
2340671 2341852 Oh, shit.
2343924 2345175 Come on.
2345699 2346925 I would have said you were Mexican,
2346927 2348779 but I don't think<br />it would have pissed her off as much.
2350359 2352953 Why do you keep everybody<br />at a certain distance?
2353735 2355583 What, you start to feel something<br />and panic.
2355584 2356865 Come on, Ria.
2357277 2359304 You're just pissed<br />because I answered the phone.
2360379 2362442 That's just where I begin to get pissed.
2362621 2363713 I mean really,
2363715 2366212 what kind of man speaks<br />to his mother that way?
2366656 2367934 Oh, this is about my mother.
2368207 2370201 What do you know<br />about my mother?
2370638 2372034 I know if I was your father,
2372436 2373913 I'd kick your fucking ass.
2374538 2376298 Ok. I was raised badly.
2376697 2379563 Why don't you take your clothes off,<br />get back in the bed and teach me a lesson?
2380127 2381389 You want a lesson?
2381391 2382512 I'll give you a lesson.
2382566 2384269 How about a geography lesson?
2384600 2386431 My father's from Puerto Rico.
2386433 2388344 My mother's from El Salvador.
2388758 2391176 Neither one of those is Mexico.
2392377 2394162 Well, then I guess the big mystery is,
2394450 2397394 who gathered all those<br />remarkably different cultures together
2397478 2400230 and taught them all<br />how to park their cars on their lawns?
2428843 2430115 Pop, you ok?
2431011 2433513 If I could piss, I'd be ok.
2435558 2436561 I'm...
2437060 2438084 Jesus.
2438547 2439698 I'm done now.
2441230 2442469 Give me a hand.
2445775 2447126 Wait a goddamn minute.
2447653 2448840 Wait a minute.
2449576 2450504 Wait a minute.
2452366 2454302 Alright. Ok.<br />Ok.
2454647 2455962 Ok.<br />There you go.
2463002 2465211 Wait, wait, wait. Stop, stop.
2465796 2467714 I got to go back.<br />Ok.
2481113 2483104 What, are you gonna stand there<br />and stare at me?
2553469 2555194 So Conklin just shot him?
2555721 2557052 They know each other?<br />Sir.
2557471 2558574 This a grudge thing?
2558935 2560149 Not as far as we can tell.
2562476 2564018 You think this is racially motivated?
2564103 2566921 Well, a dozen people heard the shots.<br />Nobody saw anything.
2567481 2568494 Who do we have on it?
2568496 2569512 Graham Waters.
2570150 2570900 Waters.
2570902 2573022 Alright, well tell him that<br />he speaks to no one but me.
2573445 2576739 Call a press conference for 4:00,<br />and I want Waters here at 3:30.
2576824 2578741 And would someone please<br />find Flanagan?
2581490 2582806 What up, Mo Phat?<br />What's up?
2584021 2586405 Man robs purses from old ladies<br />and you all.
2586407 2588115 Hey, how's it going, Mo Phat?
2588517 2590620 That nigger will steal teeth<br />from a cripple, man.
2591589 2592848 You calling him a thief?
2593127 2594258 And we do what?
2594521 2596397 The man steals from black people.
2596424 2598388 Only reason black people<br />steal from their own
2598490 2600388 is because they terrified of white people.
2600532 2601848 Oh man, please.
2601932 2602889 Think about it.
2603091 2605436 Sherman Oaks.<br />Burbank. Santa Monica.
2605677 2608077 All scary-ass places<br />for a brother to find himself.
2608234 2610647 Now, drop Mo Phat off<br />at a Starbucks in Toluca Lake,
2610710 2614616 that nigger will run like a rabbit<br />soon as somebody say decaf latte.
2615362 2617352 What the fuck did you do to my car?
2626206 2628499 Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.
2629166 2631586 I turn key to my car, but nothing.
2632630 2634854 James wanted to take this to school,
2634856 2636884 but I don't want the kids to fight over it.
2637091 2638329 Are these clean or dirty?
2639078 2640553 All clean, señora.
2641200 2643338 You know Maria,<br />just once I would like to wake up
2643340 2645496 and find these dishes in the cabinet.
2647192 2648612 Ok? Sí, señora.
2648817 2649724 No problem.
2651348 2652891 I'm starting to understand now.
2653126 2654082 By your work,
2654144 2656111 you're setting an example<br />for our neighborhood.
2656195 2658348 Sort of like a big brother<br />kind of thing, right?
2659783 2661240 Well, yeah, you laugh, man.
2661384 2664855 But you have never seen me steal<br />from a black person ever in your life.
2667289 2669582 What the hell do you think<br />you doing right now, man?
2669625 2671010 Waving down the bus.
2671428 2674013 Man, put your hand down, dawg!<br />Are you out of your mind?
2674070 2676047 You actually expect me<br />to get on a bus?
2676365 2678383 No. I was hoping we could push<br />your car across town.
2678513 2679251 You know why?
2679253 2680945 Because we just don't<br />do stuff like that no more.
2681178 2683179 You have no idea, do you?
2683523 2685732 You have no idea<br />why they put them great big windows
2685734 2687058 on the sides of buses, do you?
2687168 2687885 Why?
2688588 2689643 One reason only.
2689925 2693209 To humiliate the people of color<br />who are reduced to riding on them.
2693816 2694952 How do you know that?
2695571 2698095 You know, you could fill the Staples Center<br />with what you don't know.
2698807 2700725 Oh, you know,<br />the Kings are playing tonight.
2700870 2701919 You don't like hockey!
2701921 2704164 The only reason you say<br />you do is to piss me off!
2704827 2706119 I love hockey.
2706514 2708403 Cut! Print. Moving on.
2708412 2710438 Ok, that takes us into scene 12,
2710523 2712457 and we are in the bathroom.
2712459 2713289 Jamal,
2713862 2715432 that's what I'm talking about.
2715754 2716759 Right on.
2718966 2720615 Cam, Cam, you got a second?
2720617 2722685 Yeah, Fred. I just<br />wanna grab some coffee.
2722687 2725166 Yeah, listen,<br />I think we needed another take, buddy.
2725806 2727507 That looked pretty terrific, man.
2728183 2730057 This is gonna sound strange but is
2730059 2732187 Jamal seeing a speech<br />coach or something?
2732646 2733813 What do you mean?
2734539 2735876 Have you noticed...
2736437 2738438 I mean, this is weird<br />for a white guy to say,
2738440 2739470 but have you noticed,
2739895 2742068 he's talking a lot less black lately?
2744211 2746242 No, I haven't noticed that.<br />Really?
2746326 2747692 Like in this scene,
2747694 2749788 he was supposed to say,<br />Don't be talking about that.
2750024 2752188 And he changed it to,<br />Don't talk to me about that.
2752267 2754792 Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />You think because of that,
2754949 2758171 the audience won't recognize him<br />as being a black man?
2758255 2759253 Come on.
2759392 2760841 Is there a problem, Cam?
2761675 2762716 Excuse me?
2763313 2764929 Is there a problem, Cam?
2770543 2772352 No, we don't have a problem.
2772853 2775098 I mean, because all I'm saying is...
2775100 2776473 it's not his character.
2776684 2778964 Eddie's supposed to be the smart one,<br />not Jamal, right?
2779067 2780453 I mean, you're the expert here,
2780751 2782291 but to me, it rings false.
2786649 2788350 We're gonna do it one more time.
2789221 2790120 Thanks, buddy.
2790204 2793498 Everybody back to one, please.<br />Let's do it one more time.
2796794 2798032 Jamal, can we...
2803050 2804714 Morning, Carol. Who do I have?
2804716 2805719 Hold for a minute, please.
2805876 2809555 Mr. Trujillo called and canceled,<br />but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.
2813894 2815311 Send him in.
2817314 2818773 Mr. Ryan.<br />Yeah.
2818857 2821025 My name is Shaniqua Johnson.
2821309 2823143 I believe we spoke last night.
2823779 2824708 Oh, yeah.
2824710 2826448 I wanted to apologize about that.
2827101 2828981 I haven't been getting too much sleep.
2829100 2830527 My father's in a lot of pain.
2831313 2832620 I'm sorry to hear that.
2832746 2836916 This doctor he's been seeing<br />says he's got a urinary tract infection.
2837185 2839170 But he's been taking this medicine<br />for a month now,
2839172 2840565 and he just keeps getting worse.
2840621 2842761 And he's been back to see Dr. Robertson?
2842763 2843499 Yeah.
2843924 2845828 Between you and me,<br />the man's an idiot.
2846127 2846898 Really?
2847034 2849740 Well, no offense,<br />but the guy sees 100 patients an hour.
2849742 2851639 I think his nurses<br />are doing most of the work.
2852625 2853828 If you're unhappy,
2853830 2856770 your father's welcome to see<br />a doctor outside the network.
2857785 2860857 And if this new doctor<br />says it's not an infection,
2861211 2864301 says it's his prostate and it needs to be<br />operated on, is that gonna be covered?
2864303 2867385 Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...<br />Then what good is that gonna do?
2868713 2871077 I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
2871803 2873400 Alright. Well, you know what I can't do?
2874974 2876770 I can't look at you<br />without thinking about
2876772 2879959 the five or six more-qualified<br />white men who didn't get your job.
2880043 2881419 It's time for you to go.
2881461 2884340 Now, I'm saying this because<br />I'm really hoping that I'm wrong about you.
2884834 2886710 I'm hoping that someone like yourself,
2886903 2888801 someone who may have been given<br />a helping hand,
2888844 2891596 might have a little compassion<br />for someone in a similar situation.
2891598 2893641 Carol, I need security in my office.
2893643 2895212 You know, you don't like me, that's fine.
2895228 2896521 I'm a prick.
2897323 2899439 My father doesn't deserve<br />to suffer like this.
2900288 2902229 He was a janitor.<br />He struggled his whole life.
2902231 2903974 Saved enough to start<br />his own company.
2904109 2905920 Twenty-three employees,<br />all of them black.
2905927 2908324 Paid them equal wages<br />when no one else was doing that.
2908946 2911239 For 30 years he worked<br />side by side with those men,
2911241 2913491 sweeping and carrying garbage.
2913928 2915488 And then the city council decides
2915490 2918606 to give minority-owned companies<br />preference in city contracts.
2919124 2921055 And overnight,<br />my father loses everything.
2922278 2924603 His business, his home, his wife.<br />Everything.
2926057 2928291 Not once does he blame your people.
2930418 2932181 I'm not asking you to help me.
2932950 2934946 I'm asking that you do this small thing,
2935366 2937045 for a man who lost everything
2937428 2939685 so people like yourself<br />could reap the benefits.
2939770 2941349 And do you know what<br />it's gonna cost you?
2942149 2942898 Nothing.
2944168 2945603 Just a flick of your pen.
2947832 2950321 Your father sounds like a good man.
2950621 2952002 And if he'd come in here today,
2952004 2954667 I probably would have<br />approved this request.
2954932 2956412 But he didn't come in.
2956414 2959537 You did. And for his sake,<br />it's a real shame.
2959539 2961635 Get him the hell out of my office.<br />Prick.
2969549 2972035 Yeah sir, I spoke to our employee,
2972037 2973928 and he told you you needed to replace<br />or repair the door.
2974012 2975930 He say he fix the lock.
2976014 2978072 You come here, see how fixed it is!
2978074 2979182 <i>You're yelling again.</i>
2979184 2980879 I am not yelling! I'm upset!
2982634 2984656 Yes, I am.<br />Mom, are you alright?
2985857 2987282 Stop washing.
2987284 2989283 Insurance must take picture.
2989503 2990200 Ok?
2991534 2992387 Yes.
2992389 2993490 Look what they wrote.
2994741 2996313 They think we're Arab.
2996315 2997402 Please, you come see my store.
2997404 2998786 When did Persian become Arab?
2998870 3000749 I want. I want his name.
3001252 3001915 Yes.
3001957 3003157 Oh, my God.
3003542 3005292 I want his name!<br />Dad.
3005377 3006711 Give me his name!<br />Dad.
3006753 3008203 I'm not giving you his name, sir.
3008253 3009587 Dad, did they take the gun?
3009589 3011439 Not fix my lock!<br />I want his name!
3011441 3012112 Baba.
3012221 3014301 I'm gonna hang up now, sir.<br /><i>Don't hang up!</i>
3014386 3016336 Don't hang up! Shit!
3018181 3019401 Oh, thank God.
3065581 3066519 Mom?
3068523 3070693 Mom, it's cold. Come on.
3093799 3095683 Did you find your brother?
3097761 3098861 No, Mom.
3109523 3111273 Because I was doing good.
3114211 3116320 I was doing real good.
3118284 3121033 I know, Mom.<br />I was doing good.
3125872 3126959 It's ok.
3139219 3141262 Did you find your brother?
3143807 3144786 No, Mom.
3147394 3149645 Tell him to come home.
3151273 3153348 Tell him I'm not mad.
3153857 3154549 Ok?
3155819 3157053 Ok, baby?
3157571 3158851 Ok, Mom.
3159563 3160905 Ok, baby.
3162159 3163170 Ok.
3202407 3203958 Did you apologize to your mother?
3204429 3205406 She wasn't there.
3207688 3209219 Internal Affairs called.
3209431 3211127 Found something in the Mercedes.
3213660 3215411 That's lunch. One hour.
3244866 3246255 I tried to call.
3247119 3248847 Sounded like you were having<br />a bad day?
3249176 3249932 Yeah.
3254876 3255832 What?
3257858 3259588 I got scared, Cam.
3260800 3262292 You know, it's not like...
3262505 3264889 I haven't been pulled<br />over before, you know?
3265512 3266690 But nothing like that.
3269057 3271193 And yes, I was a little drunk
3272102 3273964 and I was mouthing off.
3274813 3276146 I'm sorry.
3279401 3281527 But when that man<br />was putting his hands on me...
3281569 3282990 I don't wanna talk about it.<br />I just...
3282992 3285579 I couldn't believe<br />you'd let him do that, baby.
3287492 3291161 Look, I know what you did,<br />was the right thing. Ok?
3292789 3294509 But I was humiliated.
3295709 3296789 For you.
3298218 3301294 I just couldn't stand to see that man<br />take away your dignity.
3302841 3303619 Yeah.
3304283 3305514 That's what happened.
3305593 3307409 Oh, baby, don't do this.
3307507 3308898 No. No, you're right.<br />Come on.
3309164 3310240 I ain't doing it.
3310598 3312378 You gonna walk away from me?
3314188 3315796 Cameron!<br />Just go home.
3325572 3326607 I understand.
3327824 3329033 Thanks.
3332950 3334336 Has your father read his policy?
3334338 3335915 He doesn't read English.
3336474 3337469 What he is saying?
3337501 3338891 He ask if you read the policy.
3340253 3341380 Mr. Golzari,
3341530 3343022 you said that you called the locksmith?
3344401 3345844 Yes. I tell him, fix it.
3346821 3348948 They said that their man told you...
3350458 3352176 to fix the door and you didn't do so.
3354504 3356176 Are you saying it's his fault?
3357854 3359933 Insurance company<br />is calling it negligence.
3361017 3362372 They're not covering any of this.
3371115 3371783 No.
3372827 3374870 This store is all we have.
3392305 3393595 I really am sorry.
3417205 3418735 What time you must go to work?
3419165 3420420 Not until tonight.
3422168 3423540 Go home and sleep.
3427090 3428466 It's ok. It's ok.
3428905 3429996 Go home and sleep.
3452907 3453693 Hey.
3455870 3456643 Maybe...
3456878 3458944 they didn't tell you,<br />but I've been reassigned.
3459205 3460358 Yeah, they told me.
3461666 3463639 I just wanted to say good luck,
3464733 3466037 and it was good riding with you.
3466212 3467158 You, too.
3471718 3473250 Wait till you've been on the job,
3473686 3474694 a few more years.
3474941 3476785 Yeah.<br />Look at me, look at me.
3478983 3480938 Wait till you've been doing it<br />a little longer.
3482687 3484357 You think you know who you are?
3487025 3488295 You have no idea.
3493513 3494623 Yo, Gomez,
3494847 3496242 you ready to roll, homie?

3808638 3809726 Thanks.
3815311 3816632 Is anything broken?
3818332 3819902 I don't think so.
3820733 3822900 Ok. I think that's good.

3852139 3853682 It's ok, it's ok.
3853766 3854998 It's ok. It's ok.
3855000 3856269 Ok, we're gonna get you out.
3856310 3857866 Everything's gonna be fine.
3858040 3858776 Look at me.

3947276 3948593 Alright. Here we go.
3948766 3950173 It's ok, it's ok.
3950175 3951143 It's alright.
3951410 3953334 I got it now. I got it.
3954200 3956201 Ma'am? Ma'am, can you walk with me?
3956285 3958386 It's cool, it's cool. It's ok.
3959413 3961183 Here we go. Alright.
3961302 3963409 You're doing great.<br />You're doing great.
3993948 3995887 The DA wanted me to apologize.
3995889 3997451 He really wanted<br />to be here himself.
3997583 3998614 No, he didn't.
3998692 4000411 If he did his own dirty work,<br />none of us would have jobs.
4000413 4002747 Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.<br />Graham Waters.
4002832 4004021 Thanks for coming in, Detective.
4004023 4005334 He just pulled into the garage.
4005418 4006737 Great, great. Press conference
4006739 4008330 is in 10 minutes,<br />so we'll make this short.
4008713 4012340 Internal Affairs says this Conklin has<br />two suspicious shootings on his record.
4012425 4015387 Both black men.<br />Both times he was cleared, but only just.
4015678 4018250 Detective Lewis makes<br />black man number three.
4018431 4021266 You know any reason<br />why we should not hang Conklin for this?
4022049 4023139 Well, it's...
4023445 4025693 it's more complicated<br />than we originally thought.
4027659 4029525 We found $300,000,
4029534 4031920 in the trunk of the car that<br />Detective Lewis was driving.
4033499 4034446 Shit!
4036648 4039617 Go down to the garage, tell him to stay<br />in the car until he hears from me.
4040286 4042322 You found the money in the Mercedes.
4042464 4043953 I thought that wasn't his car.
4044289 4046415 Well, the car's actually registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
4046417 4048293 We haven't been able<br />to get in touch with her, yet.
4048377 4049484 Apparently, she...
4050031 4051255 left town this morning.
4052326 4053464 So it wasn't Lewis' car.
4053466 4055372 He may not have even known<br />the money was in it.
4061931 4064005 Do you really think you're gonna<br />be able to make that fly?
4067682 4069690 Latasha Harlins, Rodney King.
4070651 4072900 These names ring a bell, Detective?<br />Yeah, vaguely.
4073340 4075418 We have attorneys for,
4075640 4078588 this slain police officer<br />camping in our offices.
4078590 4082256 We have his mother and a half a<br />dozen men of the cloth who swear,
4082258 4084574 that Lewis was one<br />of the twelve apostles of Christ.
4084622 4087504 We have two black city councilmen<br />and a congresswoman
4087506 4090169 who call on the hour, every hour,<br />demanding to know,
4090278 4092336 what the District Attorney<br />intends to do about this.
4092338 4094209 And you want him<br />to walk into that press room
4094211 4097353 and tell them all<br />that the situation is complicated?
4104642 4105746 Give us a minute.
4107478 4108472 No problem.
4117196 4118436 Who knows about the money?
4119515 4120828 You got to be kidding me.
4121079 4123125 There are only two people in this room.
4125371 4127082 Myself, my partner,
4127084 4128707 Ferguson and internal Affairs.
4128791 4129883 Jim Ferguson?<br />Yeah.
4135714 4136328 Ok.
4136475 4138054 Ok, I guess I don't see a problem.
4138148 4141333 As it wasn't Lewis' car, the money<br />isn't clear evidence of any wrong-doing.
4141335 4142371 And even if it was,
4142373 4144164 we aren't going to prosecute a dead man.
4144280 4145773 Which means the money internal Affairs
4145775 4147626 is holding can't even<br />be considered evidence.
4148557 4151018 What? You know, you can<br />do this whole dance if you want to,
4151020 4152442 but I'm willing to bet
4152786 4154607 when the coroner's report<br />comes back tomorrow
4154609 4157456 it's going to say that Detective Lewis<br />was coked out of his head.
4159133 4160345 Fucking black people?
4161474 4162436 What did you just say?
4162828 4163834 I mean...
4164660 4167566 You know, I know all the<br />sociological reasons why per capita
4167568 4170185 eight times more black men<br />are incarcerated than white men.
4170504 4172000 Schools are a disgrace.
4172168 4174594 Lack of opportunity.<br />Bias in the judicial system.
4174596 4176503 All that stuff. All that stuff!
4176505 4177569 But still it's...
4178432 4180963 it's got to get to you,<br />on a gut level as a black man.
4180965 4183552 They just can't keep their hands<br />out of the cookie jar.
4189226 4191102 Of course, you and I<br />know that's not the truth,
4191145 4192986 but that's the way it always plays,<br />doesn't it?
4193272 4196057 And assholes like Lewis<br />just keep feeding the flames.
4196059 4197182 It's got to get to you.
4198235 4200357 What did you say you did<br />for the DA again?
4200842 4202614 You coach ball down in Compton.<br />Am I right?
4202698 4204116 Oh, please, don't do that.
4205283 4207452 Don't act like you know<br />something about me, ok?
4207634 4209291 What do you think those kids need?
4209915 4211746 To make them believe,<br />to give them hope?
4211748 4212966 You think they need another...
4213204 4214291 drug-dealing cop
4214293 4216961 or do you think they need<br />a fallen black hero?
4217196 4219130 Why don't you cut through<br />the bullshit, Flanagan,
4219132 4220711 and just tell me what it is you want?
4223885 4226666 The DA's squad loses<br />its lead investigator next month.
4227306 4230600 Rick is quite adamant<br />that his replacement be a person of color.
4230643 4234713 It's a high-profile position, and he wants<br />to send the right message to the community.
4234855 4237644 And the right message is,<br />Look at this black boy I just bought?
4238928 4240404 Well, fuck you very much,
4240406 4241861 but thanks for thinking of me.
4243856 4245396 Actually, we were thinking of you.
4247427 4248558 Until we saw that.
4250634 4251822 It's your brother's file.
4252498 4254999 Twenty something years old<br />and already three felonies.
4255084 4257961 Three-strikes law.<br />Kid's going away for life for stealing a car.
4258003 4259587 Christ, that's a shitty law.
4260839 4262191 There's a warrant in there.
4262449 4263719 But still, hey...
4264604 4266262 he had every opportunity you had.
4269845 4271045 Fucking black people?
4276772 4278022 So all...
4279024 4283151 All I need to do to make this disappear<br />is to frame a potentially innocent man?
4283481 4285911 What are you?<br />The fucking defender of all things white?
4286365 4290034 We're talking about a white man<br />who shot three black men.
4290219 4293538 And you're arguing with me<br />that maybe we're not being fair to him?
4295325 4296795 You know what? Maybe you're right.<br />Maybe you're right.
4296797 4297916 Maybe Lewis did provoke this
4297918 4300061 and maybe he got exactly<br />what was coming to him.
4300827 4303987 Or maybe, stoned or not,<br />just being a black man in the Valley
4303989 4305633 was enough to get him killed.
4306760 4308672 There was no one there<br />to see who shot first,
4308674 4309807 so there is no way to know.
4309809 4311074 Which means we...
4311927 4313132 could get this wrong.
4315602 4317238 Maybe that's what<br />happened with your brother.
4317240 4318570 Maybe we got it wrong.
4318814 4321579 Maybe Lewis isn't the only one<br />who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
4323947 4325589 You're the one closest to all this.
4325864 4327355 You need to tell us.
4331480 4333009 What does your gut tell you?
4347092 4347997 So...
4348815 4349737 Graham.
4350216 4351294 What do I tell them?
4352014 4353041 You tell me...
4353683 4354866 and I'll tell them.
4362775 4365584 Well, I think given<br />Detective Conklin's history,
4366987 4368927 it's pretty clear what happened last night.
4370783 4371560 Ok.
4389593 4391538 Before I get to why we're here,
4391762 4395239 I know that many of you have heard<br />that we had our car stolen last night.
4395808 4397841 And as you could imagine,
4397843 4400732 my wife and I are both<br />pretty shaken up but...
4401282 4402134 we're ok.
4402229 4405630 And Jean and I truly appreciate<br />all your calls and your concern.
4405859 4406756 Thank you.
4407152 4407870 Now,
4409219 4411156 just after 9:00 p.m. last night,
4411771 4414090 Detective William Lewis,<br />an eight-year veteran of the force
4414092 4415830 and an active member<br />of the black community,
4415832 4417540 was gunned down by a fellow officer.

4586832 4588035 Get out of my car.
4588542 4590659 Oh, you so brave,<br />you get out the car, man.
4593672 4595261 Turn off the engine.
4595263 4597005 Throw the keys out the window.
4610188 4611459 You fucking want me?
4611461 4612941 Here I am, you pig fuck!
4613170 4615191 Lie face down on the ground.<br />Spread your arms and legs.
4615193 4617653 No, you lie face down on the ground<br />and spread your arms and legs.
4617696 4619562 Don't come any closer!<br />Down on your knees!
4619564 4621115 Fuck you, man!<br />What are you gonna do?

4623392 4624450 You get on your knees
4624452 4626816 and suck my motherfucking dick<br />while you down there.
4626818 4628657 Do I look like<br />I'm fucking joking with you?
4628659 4630666 Yeah, that's what you look like,<br />a fucking joke to me.
4630709 4633213 This man is making threatening gestures.<br />Threatening gestures?
4633283 4634766 You wanna see a threatening gesture?
4634768 4636253 I got a threatening gesture for you.
4636255 4637322 I know this man!
4637324 4639209 I know this man!<br />Get back.
4639211 4641042 Fuck off. Give me some space.<br />I know this guy.
4641044 4642469 Get out of the way.<br />You don't fucking know me.
4642471 4643277 Step away!
4643539 4645487 Give me some goddamn room.<br />I know this guy.
4647394 4648606 Man, don't walk up on me!
4648608 4649864 See what's happening here?
4649919 4652188 Do you wanna die here?<br />Is that what you want?
4652230 4654190 Because these guys<br />really wanna shoot you.
4654232 4657068 And the way you're acting,<br />they'll be completely fucking justified.
4657110 4658105 Fuck you!
4658107 4659041 Fuck me?<br />Step away!
4659043 4660548 Fuck me?<br />I'm not the one who's fucked here.
4660550 4661598 You're the one who's fucked here.
4661600 4663032 Because you're the one whose head's<br />gonna be blown off
4663034 4664282 and onto that man's patio.
4664451 4666911 Officer Hanson, step away.<br />He's a friend of mine, ok?
4666913 4669691 He's a fucking friend of mine!<br />This man is not armed!
4669693 4672361 He's not gonna shoot you, or me,<br />or anybody else, alright?
4672376 4674877 So give me two goddamn seconds.<br />Can you do that?
4674920 4677588 Lower your firearm!<br />Lower your firearm!
4683234 4684889 Are you starting<br />to understand the situation?
4686264 4687859 What do you want from me?
4689184 4690726 Unless you think your wife
4691182 4693896 is gonna be better off with a husband<br />who has a bloody stump for a head,
4693939 4696107 I want you to sit down on that curb,<br />put your hands on your head,
4696191 4698109 and do nothing<br />until I speak with these officers.
4698193 4701364 I'm not sitting on no curb. I'm not putting<br />my hands on my head for nobody.
4701697 4703114 Then stand right where you are
4703156 4705214 and keep your hands in plain sight.<br />Can you do that?
4708745 4710071 Yeah, I can do that.
4710872 4711798 Good.
4713402 4716320 I told this man to stay where he is<br />and keep his hands in plain sight.
4717334 4720013 This man better be related<br />to you by blood,
4720415 4721745 because this is fucking nuts.
4721747 4723271 I need this favor.
4723635 4725763 You can check the guy's name,<br />his license.
4725765 4727556 He's got no priors, no warrants.
4728272 4729761 I need to let him go with a warning.
4730843 4732496 What kind of fucking warning?
4733341 4734896 A harsh warning.
4738316 4739568 Thank you.
4743377 4744809 You've been warned.<br />Do you understand me?
4745824 4747366 Do you understand me?
4747451 4748707 You want something from me?
4749237 4750370 Because I'm right here.
4751037 4752489 Look, I'm trying to help you.
4752717 4754736 I didn't ask for your help, did I?
4756921 4757762 Go home.
4762632 4764040 Yeah, that I can do.
4843880 4844957 Look at me.
4846925 4848426 You embarrass me.
4849886 4851460 You embarrass yourself.
4894806 4895994 Daddy's home!
4916494 4918037 What's up?<br />Give me my money!
4918121 4919626 What? What money?
4919628 4920468 Daddy!
4920470 4922141 To pay for my store.<br />Give me my money!
4922143 4924002 Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!
4924044 4925303 You give me my money.<br />Daddy.
4926785 4928839 I want my fucking money!<br />Give me that truck.
4928882 4930341 That's not my truck, bro.
4930383 4932092 Daddy?<br />Elizabeth!
4932177 4933386 Hey, ok.
4933439 4934574 You know what? Hey.
4934957 4936641 I got $50. Here, here.
4936842 4938849 $50?<br />You took everything!
4939090 4940016 Mommy?
4941742 4942919 Coming, I'm coming.
4943647 4945090 He doesn't have it.
4945711 4947484 Hasn't got what?
4947859 4951070 I have it. He doesn't have<br />the impenetrable cloak.
4953114 4954823 Lara, stay out of the street!
4982018 4983450 It's ok, Daddy.
4985063 4987360 What? What?<br />I'll protect you.
5014342 5016260 It's ok. Daddy's ok.
5018638 5021098 It's a really good cloak.<br />Good.
5101554 5102974 How's it going?
5129266 5133033 I sent her out for groceries,<br />and that was two hours ago, Carol.
5134575 5136504 Well, you know what?<br />You are one to talk.
5136506 5138888 You go through, like,<br />six housekeepers a year.
5140538 5143582 I'm not snapping at you.<br />I am angry.
5144998 5147287 Yes. At them! Yes!
5147289 5149446 At them, the police,
5149628 5151730 at Rick, at Maria,
5151732 5152364 at...
5152512 5155537 the dry cleaners who destroyed<br />another blouse today,
5155539 5156862 at the gardener,
5156864 5159381 who, who, who keeps<br />over-watering the lawn.
5159388 5160056 I...
5161739 5163287 I just thought that...
5164409 5165684 Carol, I just thought that,
5166216 5167548 I would wake up today
5168079 5169552 and I would feel better,
5169962 5170746 you know?
5171242 5172514 But I was still mad.
5172844 5174497 And I realized...
5175403 5179047 I realized that it had nothing to do<br />with my car being stolen.
5181176 5183594 I wake up like this every morning.
5185096 5186446 I am angry,
5186448 5188892 all the time and I don't know why.
5189159 5191113 Carol, I don't know why.<br />And I...
5194178 5195163 Yeah.
5195165 5196221 Yeah, call me back.
5197275 5198282 Bye.
5310096 5311888 I really appreciate this.
5312815 5313788 No problem.
5320148 5321718 So how long you been out there tonight?
5321720 5322596 It's cold.
5323082 5324065 Hour, maybe.
5325220 5326259 Big surprise?
5326821 5329493 Yeah, this ain't exactly<br />pick-up-a-brother territory.
5330325 5331266 True.
5332869 5333995 So where you headed?
5334419 5336278 Anywhere the other side of the hill.
5337123 5338424 I'm going to El Segundo.
5338738 5340085 El Segundo's cool.
5341085 5342089 You've been there?
5342567 5343864 Fuck, no.
5350678 5352133 That's some good music.
5355433 5356406 No, really.
5356408 5357894 I'm starting to understand it.
5359103 5361561 Wrote me a country song myself<br />just yesterday.
5362148 5363770 I'll bet you did.
5365360 5366651 Whatever.
5381542 5383407 So what was going on<br />in the Valley tonight?
5384128 5385360 Ice-skating.
5386987 5388018 Ice-skating.
5388312 5389791 Love the ice-skating, man.
5390784 5393688 You know, when I was a kid,<br />I always wanted to be a goalie.
5394889 5395897 Come on.
5396974 5397681 What, you...
5398271 5399654 you think that's funny or something?
5400023 5401359 I think you're having fun.
5402336 5403522 Yeah. Whatever.
5413658 5414913 Something else funny?
5415531 5416735 Oh, yeah.
5418788 5420269 Yeah? What's that?
5421165 5422999 People, man. People.
5424377 5425803 People like me.
5427338 5429673 No, no, no.<br />I'm not laughing at you, man.
5431008 5432307 Yeah, I can see that.
5432615 5433970 Why don't you laugh outside?
5434316 5435966 Dawg, why are you getting<br />all bent out of shape?
5436222 5437523 I'm not getting bent, man.
5437525 5438933 I'm just pulling over.
5441853 5443395 Come on, man, keep driving.
5443714 5445189 I said I'm not laughing at you.
5445231 5447941 And I'm not telling you<br />to get the fuck out of my car.
5448220 5450318 Why you being a fucking jerk, man?<br />Just drive the car.
5450361 5452395 I've got a better idea. Get out now.
5452397 5454114 Fine. You want me to show you?<br />I'll show you.
5454198 5455623 Get your hands out of your pocket.
5455625 5456705 Put your hands where I can see them.
5456707 5457868 Who the fuck you think you're talking to?
5457910 5459035 Put your hands where I can see them.
5459037 5460202 You wanna see what's in my hands?
5460204 5462033 I'll show you what's in my fucking hands.
5498289 5499093 Oh, my God.
5534987 5536780 <i>Thank you, brother Merle, for that.</i>
5536822 5541409 <i>That was Merle Haggard here on KYHA,<br />the scene of country music here in LA.</i>
5541661 5544120 <i>It's a cold night, and it's getting colder.</i>
5544205 5547374 <i>And we're giving out tickets to the rodeo<br />coming to the Fairplex in Pomona,</i>
5547380 5548547 <i>so give us a call...</i>
5551963 5552572 Hey?
5553341 5554075 You ok?
5554813 5555766 I'm freezing.
5556160 5556875 Shit.
5557893 5558939 I heard it might snow.
5558968 5561255 Get out of here.<br />That's what I heard.
5561472 5563974 You got a smoke?<br />No. I quit.
5564642 5566094 Yeah, me, too.
5567436 5568323 What do you got?
5568809 5569823 Dead kid.
5572582 5573457 Hey, Bob.

6103305 6106492 and she said she couldn't come get me<br />because she was getting a massage.
