158900 160860 It's the sense of touch.
162380 163580 What?
165700 169340 Any real city, you walk, you know?
169420 173020 You brush past people.<br />People bump into you.
173220 176060 In L.A., nobody touches you.
178700 181820 We're always behind<br />this metal and glass.
183260 186020 I think we miss<br />that touch so much
186140 189940 that we crash into each other<br />just so we can feel something.
191900 193980 You guys okay?
194100 196060 I think he hit his head.
196940 198820 You don't think that's true?
198980 200780 Stay in your car.
200900 203580 Graham, I think<br />we got rear-ended.
203660 205660 I think we spun around twice.
205740 210500 And somewhere in there,<br />one of us lost our frame of reference.
210620 212900 And I'm gonna go look for it.
214860 217540 - Calm down, ma'am.<br />- I am calm!
217660 219660 I need to see your registration<br />and insurance.
219780 222580 Why? It's not my fault!<br />It's her fault! She do this!
222700 223420 My fault?
223580 225340 Ma'am, you really need<br />to wait in your vehicle.
225460 226340 My fault?
226460 228820 Stop in middle of street!<br />Mexicans no know how to drive.
228940 230820 She "blake" too fast.
230940 233500 I "blake" too fast? I "blake" too fast.
233620 236540 - I'm sorry you no see my "blake" lights.<br />- Ma'am.
236660 239940 See, I stop when I see a long line of cars<br />stopped in front of me.
240060 242900 Maybe you see over<br />steering wheel, you "blake" too!
242980 243940 Ma'am!
244060 246220 I call immigration on you.<br />Look what you do my car.
246340 249900 Officer, can you please write in your report how<br />shocked I am to be hit by an Asian driver!
250020 252980 - Ma'am!<br />- Ma'am, no. See, Detective...
257820 261060 All right. You've got to calm down.
268380 270540 Hey, Detective! Nice entrance.
270660 272300 Fuck you.
275300 277140 Hey, you okay?
278260 279420 I'm freezin'.
279500 282140 Shit. I heard it might snow.
282260 284460 - Get outta here.<br />- That's what I heard.
284580 287140 - You got a smoke?<br />- Nah. I quit.
287300 289820 Yeah, me too.
289980 292340 - What do you got?<br />- Dead kid.
302220 303420 Hey, Bob.
343780 346500 You get one free box of ammunition.<br />What kind do you want?
358860 361740 Yo, Osama! Plan a jihad<br />on your own time.
361860 364340 What do you want?
366980 368420 Are you making insult at me?
368500 371300 Am I making insult "at" you?<br />Is that the closest you can come to English?
371380 374180 - Yes, I speak English! I am American citizen.<br />- Oh, God, here we go.
374300 376540 I have right like you.<br />I have right to buy gun.
376660 378700 Not in my store, you don't!<br />Andy, get him outta here now!
378820 380860 - Go wait in the car.<br />- Now. Get out!
382220 383740 You're an ignorant man!
383900 385420 Yeah, I'm ignorant?<br />You're liberating my country.
385540 388460 And I'm flying 747 s into your mud huts<br />and incinerating your friends?
388580 391460 - Get the fuck out!<br />- No, you get the fuck out!
391620 393180 No, don't touch me!<br />He cheat me!
393260 395100 - Andy, now!<br />- Let's go.
395180 396580 Okay.
400060 402740 You can give me the gun<br />or give me back the money.
402820 406740 And I am really hoping<br />for the money.
410380 412860 - What kind of ammunition do you want?<br />- Whatever fits.
412940 414860 We got a lot of kinds.
414980 417260 We got long colts,<br />short colts, bull heads,
417380 419780 flat nose, hollow points,<br />wide cutters,
419940 423220 and a dozen more that'll fit<br />any size hole.
423300 426940 Just depends upon how<br />much bang you can handle.
428780 431060 I'll take the ones<br />in the red box.
434180 436500 - You know what those are?<br />- Can I have them?
446220 450220 Did you see any white people waitin' an hour<br />and 32 minutes for a plate of spaghetti?
450340 451740 And how many cups of coffee<br />did we get?
451820 454660 You don't drink coffee<br />and I didn't want any.
454740 458300 Man, that woman poured cup after cup<br />to every single white person around us.
458380 461340 But did she even ask you<br />if you wanted any?
461420 463300 We didn't get any coffee that you didn't want<br />and I didn't order,
463420 465540 and that's evidence<br />of racial discrimination?
465660 467580 Did you notice<br />that our waitress was black?
467660 470020 And black women don't think<br />in stereotypes?
470140 472460 You tell me.<br />When was the last time you met one
472580 474740 who didn't think she knew<br />everything about your lazy ass
474820 476620 before you even opened<br />your mouth, huh?
476740 478900 That waitress sized us up<br />in two seconds.
479020 482620 We're black, and black people don't tip.<br />She wasn't gonna waste her time.
482740 485580 Somebody like that? Nothing you can do<br />to change their mind.
485700 488060 How much did you leave?
488140 489980 You expect me to pay<br />for that kind of service?
490900 494300 What? What the fuck<br />is you laughin' at, man?
494380 497300 I'm seriously starting to think<br />that you're jealous of Karen.
497380 501420 Hardly. I'd just like to see you get through<br />a meal without calling her or anyone else.
501540 505860 Okay, no more phone calls.<br />As a matter of fact, you can hold the battery.
505980 507740 Okay?
509140 511380 Ten bucks says<br />she calls you in the car.
511500 514060 Wait, wait, wait.<br />See what that woman just did?
514180 516060 - You see that?<br />- She's cold.
516180 519380 She got colder<br />as soon as she saw us.
519460 522460 - Ah, come on, don't start.<br />- Man, look around you, man.
522580 525900 You couldn't find a whiter, safer<br />or better-lit part of this city right now.
526020 527820 But yet this white woman<br />sees two black guys
527940 530500 who look like UCLA students<br />strolling down the sidewalk,
530620 532940 and her reaction<br />is blind fear?
533060 535420 Look at us, dawg.<br />Are we dressed like gangbangers?
535540 538740 Huh? No.<br />Do we look threatening? No.
538820 542580 Fact. If anybody should be<br />scared around here, it's us!
542700 546500 We're the only two black faces surrounded by<br />a sea of over-caffeinated white people
546620 549180 patrolled by<br />the trigger-happy L.A.P.D.
549300 552700 So you tell me.<br />Why aren't we scared?
552820 554940 'Cause we got guns?
555020 556860 You could be right.
559700 561820 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- Gimme the keys!
561940 564540 - Hurry up! Get down!<br />- Okay, okay, okay, okay.
564660 568700 - No, no! Please!<br />- Don't look at me! Turn around!
568820 572220 - Come on! Go!<br />- We're fine! Just keep moving!
577220 581460 No, no, no! Take that voodoo-assed thing<br />off of there right now.
581580 583780 I know you just didn't call<br />Saint Christopher voodoo.
583900 585660 Man's the patron saint<br />of travelers, dawg.
585780 588540 You had a conversation<br />with God, huh? What did God say?
588620 592940 "Go forth, my son, and leave big slobbery<br />suction rings on every dashboard you find"?
593060 594100 Why the hell do you do that?
594180 596940 Look at the way your crazy ass drive,<br />then ask me again.
604380 606780 Chevy pickup and Mercedes<br />driving north on Balboa.
606940 609500 Pickup cuts in front. Driver of the Mercedes<br />gets pissed, pulls a gun.
609620 612180 Doesn't realize the guy in the pickup<br />is a cop coming off shift.
612300 614100 This Barry Gibb dude is a cop?
614180 616540 Yeah. Name's Conklin.<br />He's a narc out of Wilshire.
616620 618420 I got the Mercedes.
619300 622780 Mercedes takes a shot at him.<br />Detective Conklin returns fire. One shot.
622860 626300 Mercedes rolls to a stop. Driver opens the<br />door, falls out dead.
626380 629060 He looks very relaxed<br />for just having shot somebody.
629180 630900 He says he kept tryin'<br />to drive away.
630980 632980 The Mercedes kept pulling up next to him,<br />screaming, waving a gun.
633060 635580 Shot back in self-defense.
635660 639700 - Anybody actually see who shot first?<br />- They just heard two bangs.
639820 641580 Find me a witness.
655180 657820 That is a nice gun.
657940 662300 The car's registered<br />to a Cindy Bradley.
662420 664220 And that's not Cindy.
664300 666980 That is a William Lewis.
667100 669940 Found under the front seat.<br />Hollywood Division.
674260 678020 Looks like Detective Conklin<br />shot himself the wrong nigger.
689100 692100 - How much longer are you gonna be?<br />- This is the last one.
692220 693140 Thank you.
702460 704740 You don't think reporters listen to police calls?
704820 706540 I need to talk to you<br />for a second.
708340 710700 You just give me a minute,<br />all right?
710820 713540 - Find Flanagan, will you? Now.<br />- Yes, sir.
715300 716260 Yes, honey?
716380 718140 I want the locks changed again in the morning.
718220 721820 You want... Why don't you just go lie down?<br />Have you checked on James?
721900 724740 Of course. I've checked on him every five<br />minutes since we've been home.
724820 728860 Do not patronize me. I want the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
729660 732140 It's okay.<br />Just go to bed.
732260 735580 You know, didn't I just ask you<br />not to treat me like a child?
735740 739620 I'm sorry, Miss Jean.<br />Is okay I go home now?
739780 741180 It's fine. Thank you<br />very much for staying.
741340 742900 You're welcome. No problem.<br />Good night.
742980 745660 - Good night.<br />- We'll see you tomorrow.
745740 749660 I would like the locks<br />changed again in the morning.
749780 752020 And you might mention<br />that we'd appreciate it
752100 754220 if next time they didn't send<br />a gang member.
754340 756540 - A gang member? You mean that kid in there?<br />- Yes, yes.
756620 760180 Yes. The guy with the shaved head,<br />the pants around his ass, the prison tattoo.
760260 761460 - Those are not prison tattoos.<br />- Oh, really?
761540 763740 And he's not gonna sell our key<br />to one of his gangbanger friends
763860 766140 - the moment he is out our door?<br />- We've had a tough night.
766260 769780 - It'd be best if you went upstairs...<br />- And wait for them to break in?
769900 773220 I just had a gun pointed in my face.
773340 774260 You lower your voice!
774380 777140 And it was my fault<br />because I knew it was gonna happen.
777220 779620 But if a white person sees two black men<br />walking towards her,
779740 783140 and she turns and walks in the other direction,<br />she's a racist, right?
783260 785740 Well, I got scared<br />and I didn't say anything.
785860 788020 And ten seconds later<br />I had a gun in my face!
788100 792140 I am telling you. Your amigo in there is gonna<br />sell our key to one of his homies.
792260 796540 And this time it'd be really fucking great<br />if you acted like you actually gave a shit!
823340 825460 All right, what have we got?<br />Talk to me, Karen.
825540 827420 Flanagan doesn't think<br />anybody has the story yet.
827500 829820 I'm the goddamn<br />District Attorney of Los Angeles.
829940 832980 If my car gets jacked,<br />it's gonna make news.
833100 834820 Fuck!
835980 838140 Why did these guys<br />have to be black?
838260 839860 I mean, why?
839940 841540 No matter how we spin this,
841660 844580 I'm either gonna lose the black vote<br />or I'm gonna lose the law-and-order vote.
844700 848100 You're worrying too much. You have<br />a lot of support in the black community.
849740 852180 All right. If we can't duck this thing,<br />we're gonna have to neutralize it.
852260 856660 What we need is a picture of me<br />pinning a medal on a black man.
856740 858500 Bruce?
859740 861300 The firefighter.
861420 864260 The one who saved the camp or something.<br />Northridge. What's his name?
864340 865420 He's Iraqi.
866380 869460 He's Iraqi?<br />Well, he looks black.
869540 873180 He's dark-skinned, sir, but he's Iraqi.<br />His name's Saddam Khahum.
873300 876180 Saddam?<br />His-His name's Saddam?
876260 880220 That's real good, Bruce. I'm gonna pin a medal<br />on an Iraqi named Saddam.
880300 882420 Give yourself a raise, will you?
885300 887900 It's been good<br />doing business with you.
888740 891980 - How soon can I have them?<br />- I'm picking them up right now.
892100 895580 Look, you're not listening to me.<br />This is an emergency.
895700 898460 I keep telling you he's in pain.<br />He can't sleep.
898540 902300 Mr. Ryan, your father has been to the clinic<br />three times in the last month.
902380 907460 He is being treated for a urinary tract infection.<br />That is by no means an emergency.
907580 911540 If you have any more questions<br />about your HMO plan, why don't you
911620 915060 make an appointment to come in between<br />10:00 and 4:00, Monday through Friday.
915140 917140 What does my father do<br />about sleeping tonight?
917220 918940 I don't know.<br />I'm not a doctor.
919020 921740 - I wanna talk to your supervisor.<br />- I am my supervisor!
921860 923660 - What is your name?<br />- Shaniqua Johnson.
923780 926340 Shaniqua.<br />Big fucking surprise that is.
942020 944260 <i>Bronson Avenue, Westwood.</i>
944380 946940 <i>Vehicle is described as a black<br />late-model Lincoln Navigator.</i>
947060 951420 <i>California plate<br />4 Peter Charles Ida 315.</i>
951500 954820 <i>Suspects are two black males,<br />approximately 20 years of age.</i>
962860 963860 That's not it.
965060 966900 That's not the vehicle, John.<br />The plates don't match.
966980 970580 The driver's gotta be 40. Nobody jacks a car<br />and takes it to Studio City.
975460 977660 They were doin' something.
1020140 1021500 Enthusiastic.
1022660 1024700 Keep your hands<br />where I can see 'em, please.
1024860 1028900 I'm gonna need to see<br />your driver's license and registration.
1029020 1031100 No problem.
1031180 1034900 I'm gonna have to reach inside the glove<br />compartment to get the registration.
1034980 1037260 - Is that okay?<br />- Nice and slow, please.
1037380 1038660 Okay.
1042660 1044740 How are you tonight, Officer?
1044860 1046660 Excellent.
1048420 1050060 Here you go.
1053220 1055220 Stay inside the vehicle, please.
1064260 1066220 Let's do it again right now.
1067020 1068980 Step outta the car, please, sir.
1069060 1072620 Wait a minute, Officer.<br />I haven't been drinking or anything.
1072740 1074860 Then we shouldn't have a problem.
1074980 1077460 He doesn't drink.<br />He's a Buddhist, for Christ's sake.
1077540 1079380 No, it's okay.
1079460 1080900 It's fine.
1085780 1087700 Step onto the sidewalk, sir.
1089220 1091340 That's good. Right there.
1093020 1094460 Look at me.
1095340 1097220 I want you to stand<br />on your right foot.
1097300 1101300 Touch your nose<br />with the index finger of your left hand.
1105500 1107420 I told you he doesn't drink.
1107540 1110620 Ma'am, I'm only gonna tell you<br />one time to stay in the vehicle.
1110700 1113180 - Ma'am?<br />- Honey, honey, I'm okay. I got this.
1113300 1116540 Don't you "ma'am" me. Who the hell<br />do you think you're talking to?
1116620 1119700 Look, Officer, my wife<br />has had a couple of drinks...
1119820 1122660 Both of you, turn around. Put your hands on<br />top of your head and interlock your fingers.
1122780 1124500 Wait. We're only a block away from our house.
1124580 1126900 Hands on your head.<br />Interlock your fingers.
1126980 1129940 - Hands on your head. Interlock your fingers.<br />- I'm a television director.
1130020 1132700 Me and my wife were just coming home<br />from an awards show.
1132780 1135020 Take your hands off him.<br />He's done nothing wrong.
1135140 1137140 Put your hands on top<br />of your head, ma'am.
1137220 1138660 - Do what he says.<br />- Fuck you!
1138780 1139700 Put your hands...
1139780 1142460 And you keep<br />your filthy fucking hands off me!
1142580 1144140 You motherfucking pig!
1144260 1147620 - Just stop talking!<br />- That's quite a mouth you have.
1147740 1149380 Of course you know that.
1149540 1153180 Fuck you! That's what<br />this is all about, isn't it?
1153260 1155940 You thought you saw a white woman blowin' a<br />black man. That drove your cracker ass crazy.
1156060 1157700 Will you just shut<br />your fucking mouth!
1157820 1160740 I'd listen to your husband, ma'am.
1160860 1163060 Put your legs open.
1164740 1169020 Do you have any guns or knives<br />or anything I might get stuck with?
1169140 1171540 I'm wearing a cocktail dress.<br />What do you think?
1171620 1173660 You'd be surprised some of the places<br />I've found weapons.
1173780 1174620 He's clean.
1176100 1179820 What do you think we should do about this,<br />Mr. Thayer?
1180660 1183860 My partner and I just witnessed your wife<br />performing fellatio on you
1183980 1186020 while you were operating<br />a motor vehicle.
1186180 1190100 That's reckless endangerment,<br />which incidentally is a felony.
1192020 1196420 We could charge your wife with lewd conduct<br />and performing a sexual act in public.
1198580 1201180 You say you're a block from home.
1201300 1203580 We could use our discretion
1203660 1205620 and let you go with a warning,
1206500 1208860 or we could cuff you and put you<br />in the back of the car.
1211500 1214340 What do you think<br />we should do, sir?
1221540 1224620 Look, we're sorry, and
1224740 1230020 we would appreciate if you would just<br />let us go with a warning, please.
1234460 1237020 The man's apologizing, Tommy.
1237140 1240100 I think we can let him go.<br />Don't you?
1242700 1244220 Yeah.
1244300 1246460 All right.
1247620 1249020 You can go.
1258180 1260380 You folks<br />drive safe now, huh?
1293220 1295460 Let's go, Tommy.
1303300 1305100 It won't close.
1306380 1307300 I can do that.
1307420 1309220 Dad, you couldn't even get it open.
1309340 1311220 Have respect for your father.<br />Give me the gun!
1312980 1315500 Here. Now you can shoot<br />anybody you want.
1315620 1318300 Dorri, that man<br />could've killed your mother.
1318380 1321620 You think I should let crazy people<br />do what they want to us?
1321700 1323140 Farhad, it won't close.
1327580 1329900 Dorri, you should be at work.
1340980 1342900 Who are you calling?
1343020 1345500 I'm gonna report their asses.<br />Sons of bitches.
1345660 1349460 You actually believe they're gonna take<br />anything you have to say seriously?
1349580 1353740 Do you have any idea how that felt?<br />To have that pig's hands all over me?
1353860 1355580 And you just stood there!
1357540 1359260 And then you apologized to him?
1359340 1362140 What did you want me to do?<br />Get us both shot?
1362220 1365540 They were gonna shoot us<br />on Ventura Boulevard! Pathetic.
1365620 1369220 Well, maybe you would've been satisfied<br />with just being arrested.
1369340 1373020 Oh, I get it. Much better to let him<br />shove his hand up my crotch
1373180 1375820 than get your name in the paper.
1375940 1377980 You finally got me<br />figured out, 'cause see,
1378100 1380740 that's exactly<br />what I was worried about right there.
1380860 1383780 Oh? You weren't afraid that<br />all your good friends at the studio
1383900 1387580 were gonna read about you in the morning<br />and realize he's actually black?
1389180 1391100 You need to calm down right now.
1391220 1395860 What I need is a husband who will not just<br />stand there while I am being molested!
1395940 1398820 They were cops for God sakes!<br />They had guns!
1400420 1403020 Maybe I should've let them<br />arrest your ass.
1403140 1406700 Sooner or later you gotta find out<br />what it is really like to be black.
1407700 1409500 Fuck you, man.<br />Like you know.
1409580 1413140 <i>The closest you ever came to being black,<br />Cameron, was watching The Cosby Show.</i>
1413220 1416220 At least I wasn't watching it<br />with the rest of the equestrian team.
1416300 1418380 You're right, Cameron.<br />I got a lot to learn
1418500 1421460 'cause I haven't quite learned<br />how to shuck and jive.
1421540 1424300 Let me hear it again.<br />Thank you, mister policeman.
1424420 1427020 You sure is mighty kind<br />to us poor black folk.
1427140 1431460 You be sure to let me know next time<br />you wanna finger-fuck my wife.
1432940 1435740 How the fuck do you say<br />something like that to me?
1436820 1437980 You know, fuck you!
1440020 1443460 That's good. A little anger.<br />It's a bit late, but it's nice to see!
1491300 1492300 How's it goin'?
1492420 1493980 Okay.
1494100 1496140 You didn't get scared<br />or something, did you?
1496260 1498900 There's no monsters in the closet, right?<br />'Cause I hate monsters.
1498980 1501860 There's no such thing<br />as monsters.
1501980 1503860 Ah, that's a good thing.
1504020 1505420 I heard a bang.
1505540 1507060 Like a truck bang?
1507180 1509180 Like a gun.
1516140 1519820 That's funny, 'cause we moved<br />outta that bad neighborhood.
1519940 1522620 And there's not<br />too many guns around here.
1523940 1526220 How far can bullets go?
1526340 1528220 They go pretty far.
1528300 1530980 But they usually get stuck<br />in something and stop.
1531100 1532700 What if they don't?
1532780 1536380 You thinking about that bullet<br />that came through your window?
1538980 1540980 You think we should move again?
1541100 1542460 I like it here.
1542540 1544460 Me too. But if that bullet<br />found out where we lived...
1546020 1546980 Oh, hold on.
1547100 1548500 What?
1548620 1550580 So stupid!<br />How can I forget this?
1551940 1552860 What?
1554980 1556540 Nah. Forget it.<br />You ain't gonna believe me.
1556660 1558140 Tell me.
1558980 1561340 Okay.
1561420 1564940 When I was five, this fairy<br />came into my room one night.
1565060 1567580 - Right.<br />- See, I told you you weren't gonna believe me.
1567700 1570020 - Okay, go to sleep now, you little rat.<br />- No, tell me.
1572100 1574260 Okay.
1574340 1579420 So this fairy comes into my room and I'm like,<br />"Yeah, right, you're a fairy."
1579500 1581460 Anyway, we're talking, you know.
1581540 1584540 And she's flying all around the room,<br />knocking down all my posters and stuff.
1584620 1586900 She was flying?
1586980 1589500 She had these little stubby wings.<br />She could've glued 'em on, you know?
1589620 1592140 Like I'm gonna believe<br />she's a fairy.
1592260 1594140 So she said, "I'll prove it."
1594220 1596700 So she reaches<br />into her backpack.
1596820 1598980 And she pulls out<br />this invisible cloak.
1599140 1603500 She ties it around my neck, and she tells me<br />that it's impenetrable.
1603620 1605780 You know what<br />impenetrable means?
1605860 1607660 It means that nothing<br />can go through it.
1607700 1609860 No bullets. Nothing.
1609980 1613660 She told me that if I wore it,<br />nothing would hurt me.
1613780 1618540 So I did. And my whole life,<br />I never got shot, stabbed.
1618660 1621460 Nothing.<br />I mean, how weird is that?
1621540 1625340 Only she told me that I was supposed to give it<br />to my daughter on her fifth birthday.
1625460 1627140 And I forgot.
1627260 1628660 Can I touch it?
1628820 1630740 Sure, go ahead.
1633060 1635940 - I don't feel it.<br />- Yeah. It's pretty cool, huh?
1636100 1639780 I can take it off and tie it around your<br />shoulders. She told me how to do it.
1639900 1643380 - Unless you think it's stupid.<br />- Don't you need it?
1643460 1646140 No, not anymore.
1646260 1649060 So what do you think?<br />You want it?
1655100 1656740 Okay, let's get outta here.
1662260 1663180 Okay.
1676580 1679140 Put your head up.
1683940 1686500 Okay. Is that too tight?
1686620 1688980 Do you feel anything at all?
1689060 1691380 Good. Then it's just right.
1697420 1699780 Do I take it off<br />when I have a bath?
1699940 1702580 No, you leave it on<br />all the time.
1702660 1707820 Until you have a daughter when she turns five,<br />then you give it to her.
1707940 1709180 Okay?
1710020 1710940 Okay.
1713260 1716580 Okay. Good night, sweetie.
1717700 1720140 Good night.
1757860 1761140 Nah, nah. You wanna listen to music<br />of the oppressor, you go right ahead, man.
1762020 1765140 How in the lunacy of your mind<br />is hip-hop music of the oppressor?
1765220 1768380 Listen to it, man!<br />"Nigger this, nigger that."
1768460 1771780 You think white people go around calling<br />each other honkies all day, man?
1771900 1773260 "Hey, honky, how's business?"
1773380 1775260 "Going great, cracker.<br />We're diversifying."
1775340 1779940 How 'bout this, huh? Listen. You like that?<br />Man's singin' about lynchin' niggers.
1780060 1781700 And you think<br />there's a difference, don't you? Huh?
1781820 1785740 <i>Gonna buy me a rope<br />and lynch me a nigger</i>
1785860 1788900 You have absolutely no idea where hip-hop<br />music comes from, do you?
1789020 1791460 <i>I'd shoot 'em dead first<br />but I done broke my trigger</i>
1791620 1793740 See, back in the '60s we had<br />smart, articulate black men.
1793860 1796060 <i>Gonna get out my sheet<br />Put my hood on my head</i>
1796180 1798980 Like Huey Newton, Bobby Seale,<br />Eldridge Cleaver, Fred Hampton.
1799060 1800380 <i>Gonna string 'em up good</i>
1800460 1802180 These brothers were speaking out,<br />and people were listening!
1802300 1803900 <i>Then they'll be dead</i>
1804020 1805940 Then the FBI said,<br />"No, we can't have that."
1806020 1808700 <i>Home of the brave<br />and the land of the free</i>
1808820 1810780 "Let's give the niggers<br />this music by a bunch of mumbling idiots
1810900 1813500 and sooner or later,<br />they'll all copy it, and nobody
1813620 1815540 will be able to understand<br />a fucking word they say.
1815620 1817700 End of problem."
1824420 1825660 What the fuck was that, dawg?
1839420 1841540 - Holy shit!<br />- What?
1841660 1843140 Man, we done ran over a Chinaman.
1844340 1845980 You're sayin' there's a Chinaman<br />under this truck?
1846100 1847140 What part don't you understand?
1847260 1849980 There's a Chinaman stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck.
1852300 1853220 Help me.
1853380 1855900 Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
1856060 1859580 Ah, God. What the hell did he do,<br />just leap out in front of the truck?
1860420 1862620 Man! This is so<br />completely fucked up.
1862700 1864500 Oh, really? No shit!
1864580 1867540 Okay, hold up.<br />Hold up, hold up, hold up.
1867620 1869540 - Get back in the truck.<br />- What?
1869620 1871740 - Yes, get back in the truck.<br />- You think we didn't drag him far enough?
1871820 1874580 No, we gonna drive away.<br />And he gonna let go.
1874660 1876300 He's not gonna let go, Anthony.
1876420 1879380 You know why? Because he's stuck<br />underneath the fucking truck!
1879460 1884500 Now, if he could've let go, he probably would've<br />considered that option half a block back.
1884580 1887900 What you and I gotta do, just grab his arms<br />and pull him from underneath.
1888060 1889580 You grab his arm,<br />it's gonna fall off.
1889700 1892380 Then you gonna be standing in the street<br />holding a Chinaman's arm.
1892460 1894300 Then what your ass gonna do, huh?
1895180 1898580 If we leave this man here, he dies.<br />Then we're up for murder charges.
1899540 1902460 Just grab his arm.<br />We'll just pull him out.
1907460 1910620 I don't wanna cause any problems, Lieutenant.<br />I just want a new partner.
1910700 1912700 I understand. Your partner's a racist prick.
1912780 1915100 But you don't wanna stir up<br />any bad feelings with him.
1915220 1916940 He's been on the force for a long time.
1917060 1919100 Seventeen years.
1919260 1921340 And I do have to work here, sir.
1921500 1923780 So you don't mind<br />that there's a racist prick on the force.
1923900 1926740 You just don't want him<br />to ride in your car.
1926820 1929500 If you need me to go on record<br />about this, sir, I will.
1929620 1931340 That'd be great.<br />Write a full report.
1931460 1934140 Because I'm anxious to<br />understand how an obvious bigot
1934220 1937060 could've gone undetected<br />in this department for 17 years.
1937140 1939220 Eleven of which he was under<br />my personal supervision.
1939300 1941620 Which doesn't speak very highly<br />of my managerial skills.
1941700 1945260 But that's not your concern.<br />I can't wait to read it.
1945380 1949100 What if I said I wanted a new partner<br />for personal reasons?
1949220 1952340 So now you're saying he's not a racist prick,<br />you just don't like him.
1952460 1955220 - Yes, sir.<br />- That's not a good enough reason.
1955300 1958100 Then I guess I should think of a better one<br />and get back to you.
1958180 1961020 So you think I'm asking you<br />to make one up.
1961100 1965660 Uh, no, sir. I just can't<br />think of one... right now.
1965780 1967780 You wanna know what I heard?
1969180 1971140 I heard it was a case<br />of uncontrollable flatulence.
1971260 1973300 You want me to say<br />he has flatulence?
1973380 1976060 Not him. You.<br />You have uncontrollable flatulence.
1976140 1979460 You're too embarrassed to ride with anybody<br />else so you're requesting a one-man car.
1979580 1982380 I'm not... comfortable with that,<br />Lieutenant.
1982500 1985300 I wouldn't be either. Which is why<br />I understand your need for privacy.
1985380 1989020 Just like I'm sure you understand how hard<br />a black man has to work to get to,
1989100 1992100 say, where I am, in a racist fucking<br />organization like the L.A.P.D.
1992220 1995100 and how easily<br />that can be taken away.
1995220 1998180 Now, that being said,<br />it's your decision.
1998300 2002900 You can put your career and mine on the line<br />in pursuit of a just cause,
2002980 2006740 or you can admit to having<br />an embarrassing problem
2006820 2009020 of a personal nature.
2012220 2014100 Fuck.
2043260 2044180 Excuse me.
2045540 2047980 Excuse me. Sir?
2048100 2049300 You finished?
2049420 2053020 I replaced the lock.<br />But you got a real problem with that door.
2053140 2055500 You fix the lock?
2055620 2059580 Nah, I replaced the lock.<br />But you gotta fix that door.
2059700 2062940 - Just fix the lock!<br />- Sir, sir, sir. Listen to me.
2063060 2066100 What you need<br />is a new door.
2066180 2068540 - I need new door?<br />- Yeah.
2068620 2070980 Okay. How much?
2071100 2074860 I don't... Sir, you're gonna have to call<br />somebody that sells doors.
2074980 2078900 You try to cheat me, right?<br />You have a friend that fix door?
2079020 2081060 Nah, I don't have a friend<br />that fix doors, bro.
2081220 2083420 Then go and fix the fucking lock, you cheater.
2083540 2086180 You... You know what?
2086300 2089620 Why don't you just pay for the lock<br />and I won't charge you for the time.
2089700 2092020 You don't fix the lock!<br />I pay! You think I'm stupid?
2092100 2095140 You fix the fucking lock,<br />you cheater!
2095260 2097620 - I'd appreciate if you'd stop calling me names.<br />- Then fix the fucking lock!
2097740 2101060 I replaced the lock!<br />You gotta fix the fucking door!
2101140 2104220 You cheat!<br />You fucking cheater!
2104340 2106940 - Fine. Don't pay.<br />- What?
2107020 2109660 - Have a good night.<br />- What? No. Wait!
2109780 2112620 Wait! You come back here!<br />You fix the lock!
2112740 2114780 Come here! You fix my lock!
2114940 2116340 Fix the fucking lock!
2122340 2126100 I understand. You run over a Chinaman.<br />Stuff him in the back.
2126220 2128980 Then bring the truck here<br />so I can share in the experience.
2129060 2131780 Come on, man. It's a little bit of blood.<br />It'll wash right off.
2131900 2134100 - Georgie, burn this thing.<br />- Burn it?
2134180 2136340 It's a brand-new Navigator.<br />All you need is a little piece of carpet.
2136420 2138340 You watch the Discovery Channel?
2138460 2141700 - Not a lot.<br />- They got some good shit on that channel.
2141860 2145260 Every night there is a show<br />with somebody shining a blue light
2145380 2149420 and finding tiny specks of blood splattered<br />on carpets and walls and ceiling fans,
2149540 2153860 bathroom fixtures and special-edition plastic<br />Burger King tray cups.
2153980 2157300 The next thing they show is some stupid<br />redneck in handcuffs
2157420 2161460 who looks absolutely stunned<br />that this is happening to him.
2161540 2164460 Sometimes the redneck is actually watching<br />the Discovery Channel
2164580 2166460 when they break in to arrest him.
2166580 2171580 And he still can't figure out how on earth<br />they could've caught him!
2179220 2182940 Do I look like I wanna be<br />on the Discovery Channel?
2183060 2184220 No.
2184300 2186780 Then get the fuck<br />outta my shop.
2189180 2191220 Oh, yeah, make sure<br />you get that.
2191300 2194580 Without him, things could've gone really<br />fucking wrong tonight.
2196580 2200220 - Fuck!<br />- Don't! Don't you dare.
2200300 2202100 Don't.
2202180 2205180 Graham Waters.
2205300 2209340 No. No, he's not here, Mom.
2210780 2213620 I'm not gonna go looking for him.
2213740 2216900 Look, he'll be home when...<br />Just leave it alone.
2217020 2221500 Mom, I can't talk to you right now, okay?<br />I'm having sex with a white woman.
2221580 2223900 Okay, where were we?
2224020 2226380 I was white, and you were<br />about to jerk off in the shower.
2226500 2229220 Oh, shit!
2229340 2231300 Come on.
2231420 2236180 I would've said you were Mexican, but I don't<br />think it would've pissed her off as much.
2236260 2238460 Why do you keep everybody<br />at a certain distance, huh?
2238620 2242100 - What, you start to feel something and panic?<br />- Come on, Maria.
2242220 2245540 You're just pissed<br />'cause I answered the phone.
2245620 2247900 That's just where<br />I begin to get pissed.
2247980 2251180 I mean, really, what kind of man<br />speaks to his mother that way?
2251300 2255180 Oh, this is about my mother.<br />What do you know about my mother?
2255300 2258100 If I was your father,<br />I'd kick your fucking ass.
2259500 2261420 Okay. I was raised badly.
2261540 2264820 Why don't you take your clothes off,<br />get back into bed and teach me a lesson?
2264900 2268700 You want a lesson? I'll give you a lesson.<br />How 'bout a geography lesson?
2268820 2272780 My father's from Puerto Rico.<br />My mother's from El Salvador.
2272900 2275820 Neither one of those is Mexico.
2275940 2278300 Ah. Then I guess the big mystery is
2278380 2281700 who gathered all those<br />remarkably different cultures together
2281820 2284740 and taught them all how<br />to park their cars on their lawns?
2311420 2313660 Pop, you okay?
2313780 2316660 If I could piss, I'd be okay.
2318180 2320780 I'm... Jesus.
2320900 2323260 I'm done now.
2323380 2325300 Give me a hand.
2327740 2329580 Wait a goddamn minute!
2329700 2332220 - Wait a minute.<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
2334180 2337460 All right. Okay. Okay.
2344580 2347060 Wait, wait, wait.<br />Stop, stop!
2347140 2349700 - I gotta go back.<br />- Okay.
2361500 2364460 What, are you gonna<br />stand there and stare at me?
2430620 2433140 - So Conklin just shot him?<br />- Mm-hmm.
2433260 2434860 - They know each other?<br />- Sir.
2434980 2436060 It's a grudge thing?
2436180 2437980 Not as far as we can tell.
2439300 2441020 You think this is<br />racially motivated?
2441100 2444300 Well, a dozen people heard the shots.<br />Nobody saw anything.
2444420 2446300 - Who do we have on it?<br />- Graham Waters.
2446380 2450220 Waters. All right. Well, tell him<br />he speaks to no one but me.
2450340 2453340 Call a press conference for 4:00,<br />and I want Waters here at 3:30.
2453460 2455260 And would someone<br />please find Flanagan.
2457220 2458780 Oh! What up, Mo Phat?
2460420 2464540 Man robs purses from old ladies and you,<br />"Hey, how's it goin', Mo Phat?"
2464700 2467540 That nigger will steal teeth<br />from a cripple, man.
2467700 2470100 You callin' him a thief?<br />And we do what?
2470220 2472060 The man steals<br />from black people.
2472140 2476220 Only reason black people steal from their own<br />is 'cause they terrified of white people.
2476300 2477500 Oh, man, please.
2477620 2480860 Think about it. Sherman Oaks.<br />Burbank. Santa Monica.
2480940 2483420 All scary-ass places<br />for a brother to find himself.
2483500 2485820 Drop Mo Phat at a Starbucks<br />in Toluca Lake,
2485900 2489860 that nigger will run like a rabbit soon<br />as somebody say "decaf latte."
2489980 2493060 What the fuck did you do to my car?
2500180 2503460 Sorry I take your car, Miss Jean.
2503580 2506420 I turn key to my car, but nothing.
2506500 2508380 James wanted to take this to school.
2508460 2511060 But I don't want the kids to fight over it.
2511140 2514740 - Are these clean or dirty?<br />- All clean, senora!
2514820 2519540 You know, Maria, just once I would like to<br />wake up and find these dishes in the cabinet.
2520820 2523260 <i>Si, senora.<br />No problem.</i>
2524780 2526460 I'm startin' to understand now.
2526620 2529380 By your work, you're settin' an example<br />for our neighborhood.
2529500 2531860 Sort of like a big brother<br />kind of thing, right?
2532860 2534260 Yeah, you laugh, man.
2534380 2538340 But you have never seen me steal<br />from a black person ever in your life.
2540300 2542340 What the hell do you think<br />you doin' right now, man?
2542460 2543860 Wavin' down the bus.
2543940 2546340 Put your hand down, dawg!<br />Are you outta your mind?
2546460 2548740 You actually expect me<br />to get on a bus?
2548860 2551020 No. I was hopin' we could<br />push your car across town.
2551140 2552980 You know why? 'Cause we just don't<br />do stuff like that no more.
2553060 2555580 You have no idea, do you?
2555700 2559060 You have no idea why they put them great big<br />windows on the sides of buses, do you?
2559180 2561580 - Why?<br />- One reason only.
2561700 2565860 To humiliate the people of color<br />who are reduced to ridin' on 'em.
2565980 2567260 I didn't know that.
2567380 2570220 You could fill the Staples Center<br />with what you don't know.
2570340 2572220 You know the Kings<br />are playin' tonight.
2572300 2575540 You don't like hockey! The only reason<br />you say you do is to piss me off!
2575620 2577820 I love hockey.
2577940 2579420 Cut! Print. Moving on.
2579540 2580620 Okay, that takes us into scene 12.
2580700 2581980 Okay, that takes us into scene 12.
2583660 2586580 Jamal, that's what<br />I'm talking about.
2586660 2587980 Right on.
2589820 2593100 - Cam, you got a second?<br />- Yeah, Fred, I just wanna grab some coffee.
2593220 2595860 Yeah. Listen. I think<br />we need another take, buddy.
2595940 2598580 That looked<br />pretty terrific, man.
2598660 2602660 This is gonna sound strange, but is Jamal<br />seeing a speech coach or something?
2602780 2604620 What do you mean?
2604740 2608020 Have you noticed, uh...<br />This is weird for a white guy to say,
2608140 2611740 but have you noticed<br />he's talking a lot less black lately?
2613780 2615180 No, I haven't noticed that.
2615300 2619100 Really? Like in this scene, he was supposed to<br />say, "Don't be talkin' 'bout that."
2619220 2621460 And he changed it to,<br />"Don't talk to me about that."
2621580 2622780 Wait a minute.
2622940 2627260 You think because of that, the audience<br />won't recognize him as being a black man?
2627420 2628340 Come on!
2628460 2630420 Is there a problem, Cam?
2630580 2632100 Excuse me?
2632220 2634420 Is there a problem, Cam?
2639140 2641540 No, we don't have a problem.
2641660 2644700 I mean, 'cause all I'm saying<br />is it's not his character.
2644820 2647300 Eddie's supposed to be<br />the smart one, not Jamal, right?
2647420 2651060 You're the expert here.<br />But to me, it rings false.
2654300 2657940 - We're gonna do it one more time.<br />- Thanks, buddy.
2658020 2661820 Everybody back.<br />Let's do it one more time.
2664260 2666260 Jamal, um...
2670300 2671860 Morning, Carol.<br />Who do I have?
2671940 2673220 Hold for a minute, please.
2673340 2677340 Mr. Trujillo called and cancelled,<br />but you have a walk-in, Mr. Ryan.
2680460 2683100 Send him in.
2683180 2685380 - Mr. Ryan.<br />- Yeah.
2685500 2687580 My name is Shaniqua Johnson.
2687700 2690140 I believe we spoke last night.
2690300 2693580 Oh, yeah. I wanted<br />to apologize about that.
2693700 2696580 I haven't been gettin' too much sleep.<br />My father's in a lot of pain.
2696700 2699060 Oh! I'm sorry to hear that.
2699180 2703100 This doctor he's been seein'<br />says he's got a urinary tract infection.
2703220 2706580 But he's been takin' this medicine for a month,<br />and he keeps gettin' worse.
2706660 2708620 And he's been back to see<br />Dr. Robertson?
2708740 2711300 Yeah. Between you and me,<br />the man's an idiot.
2711420 2713260 - Really?<br />- No offense.
2713380 2716660 But the guy sees 100 patients an hour.<br />I think his nurses are doing most of the work.
2716740 2721620 Mmm. If you're unhappy, your father's welcome<br />to see a doctor outside the network.
2721740 2725980 And if this new doctor<br />says it's not an infection,
2726100 2729100 says it's his prostate and it needs to be<br />operated on, is that gonna be covered?
2729220 2732660 - Not unless Dr. Robertson authorizes...<br />- What good is that gonna do?
2732740 2735340 I'm sorry. There's nothing else I can do.
2735460 2737700 All right.<br />You know what I can't do?
2738980 2741460 I can't look at you without<br />thinking about the five or six
2741540 2743820 more qualified white men<br />who didn't get your job.
2743940 2745580 It's time for you to go.
2745700 2748700 I'm saying this 'cause I'm hoping<br />that I'm wrong about you.
2748780 2750340 I'm hoping that someone like yourself,
2750500 2752620 someone who may have been<br />given a helping hand,
2752740 2755420 might have a little compassion<br />for someone in a similar situation.
2755500 2757460 Carol, I need security in my office!
2757620 2760500 You don't like me, that's fine.<br />I'm a prick.
2760620 2763100 My father doesn't deserve<br />to suffer like this.
2763180 2765140 He was a janitor.<br />He struggled his whole life.
2765220 2766980 Saved enough to start<br />his own company.
2767100 2768980 Twenty-three employees,<br />all of them black.
2769060 2771660 Paid 'em equal wages<br />when no one else was doing that.
2771780 2776420 For 30 years he worked side by side with<br />those men, sweeping and carrying garbage.
2776540 2778300 Then the city council decides to give
2778420 2781540 minority-owned companies<br />preference in city contracts.
2781700 2784300 And overnight,<br />my father loses everything.
2784420 2787700 His business, his home, his wife.<br />Everything!
2787780 2791300 Not once does he blame your people.
2791420 2794740 I'm not asking you to help me.
2794860 2799020 I'm asking that you do this small thing<br />for a man who lost everything
2799140 2801340 so people like yourself<br />could reap the benefits.
2801460 2803660 And do you know<br />what it's gonna cost you?
2803780 2805620 Nothing.
2805700 2807580 Just a flick of your pen.
2809060 2811900 Your father sounds<br />like a good man.
2811980 2815940 And if he'd come in here today, I probably<br />would've approved this request.
2816100 2820340 But he didn't come in. You did.<br />And for his sake, it's a real shame.
2820420 2823260 Get him the hell outta my office.
2827180 2829980 Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
2830060 2834500 Sir, I spoke to our employee, and he told you<br />you needed to replace or repair the door.
2834620 2836220 He say he fix the lock.
2836300 2838780 <i>- You come here, see how "fix-ed" it is!<br />- You're yelling again.</i>
2838900 2840700 I am not yelling! I'm upset!
2840820 2843100 Yes... Yes, I am.
2843180 2844740 Mom, are you all right?
2844900 2848940 Stop washing.<br />Insurance must take picture.
2849060 2850460 Okay?
2851820 2854100 Look what they wrote.
2854180 2856100 They think we're Arab.
2856220 2858180 When did Persian become Arab?
2858300 2861020 I want his name. Yes.
2861100 2862620 Oh, my God.
2862740 2865660 - I want his name! Give me his name!<br />- Dad?
2865780 2867100 I'm not giving you his name, sir.
2867180 2870820 - Dad, did they take the gun?<br />- Not fix my lock! I want his name!
2870940 2872860 I'm gonna hang up now, sir.
2872980 2876580 Don't hang up! Shit!
2876700 2878460 Oh, thank God.
2922500 2923740 Mom?
2925420 2927580 Mom, it's cold. Come on.
2948900 2951100 Did you find your brother?
2953180 2955220 No, Mom.
2964300 2966740 I was doin' good.
2967980 2971300 I was... I was doin' real good.
2973060 2975260 - I know, Mom.<br />- I was doin'...
2979980 2981820 It's okay.
2992740 2994820 Did you find your brother?
2997060 2999380 No, Mom.
3000660 3003060 Tell him to come home.
3004420 3009500 Tell him I'm not mad, okay?<br />Okay, baby?
3009620 3012060 Okay, Mom.
3012220 3014580 Okay, baby.
3014700 3016220 Okay.
3017220 3019180 Okay.
3053340 3056140 - Did you apologize to your mother?<br />- She wasn't there.
3058020 3061500 Internal Affairs called.<br />Found something in the Mercedes.
3064180 3066300 That's lunch. One hour.
3094340 3096060 I tried to call.
3096180 3098220 Sounded like you're havin'<br />a bad day, huh?
3098340 3099580 Yeah.
3103900 3105620 What?
3106580 3108460 I got scared, Cam.
3108580 3113780 It's not like I haven't been<br />pulled over before. You know?
3113900 3115820 But not like that.
3117100 3119020 And, yes, I was a little drunk.
3119140 3122900 And I was mouthing off.
3122980 3125100 I'm sorry.
3127140 3128820 But when that man was<br />putting his hands on me...
3128900 3130540 I don't wanna talk about it.
3130660 3133820 I can't believe<br />you let him do that, baby.
3135140 3138580 Look, I know what you did<br />was the right thing. Okay?
3140100 3142700 But I was humiliated!
3142820 3144860 For you.
3144980 3149260 I just couldn't stand to see<br />that man take away your dignity.
3149380 3152260 Yeah. That's what happened.
3152380 3155260 - Oh, baby, don't do this.<br />- No. No, you're right.
3155380 3157060 I ain't doin' it.
3157180 3159580 You gonna walk away from me?
3159700 3162740 - Cameron!<br />- Just go home.
3168540 3169820 Mm-hmm.
3171300 3172220 I understand.
3174180 3175380 Thanks.
3178620 3181860 - Has your father read his policy?<br />- He doesn't read English.
3185540 3187740 Mr. Golzari, you said<br />you called the locksmith?
3189500 3190620 Yes. I tell him, fix it.
3191500 3197540 They said their man told you to fix the door,<br />and you didn't do so.
3199500 3201420 Are you saying it's his fault?
3202700 3206940 Insurance company is calling it negligence.<br />They're not covering any of this.
3214300 3219220 No. This store is all we have.
3235700 3237620 I really am sorry.
3259300 3261340 What time<br />you must go to work?
3261500 3262660 Not until tonight.
3264380 3265780 Go home and sleep.
3268900 3271380 It's okay. It's okay.<br />Go home and sleep.
3293700 3294700 Hey.
3296420 3299700 Maybe they didn't tell you,<br />but I've been reassigned.
3299780 3301900 Yeah, they told me.
3302020 3304700 I just wanted to say, good luck
3304780 3306540 and it was good ridin' with you.
3306620 3308220 You too.
3311140 3314260 Wait till you've been<br />on the job a few more years.
3314340 3317420 - Yeah.<br />- Look at me, look at me.
3317540 3321980 Wait till you've been doin' it<br />a little longer.
3322060 3325820 You think you know<br />who you are, hmm?
3325940 3328580 You have no idea.
3331940 3334860 Yo, Gomez,<br />you ready to roll, homie?
3334980 3336700 Ready, amigo.
3346140 3349020 Radio check, 2-1-L-2-3.

3518940 3519660 Ma'am?
3519780 3521580 Can you hear me?
3521700 3524140 Paramedics are rolling.<br />They'll be here in two minutes.
3524260 3527180 - Get an extinguisher, and get that fire out.<br />- Jesus.
3530700 3533980 Ma'am, are you hurt?
3534060 3537020 - Can you move?<br />- I... I can't breathe.
3539980 3542860 Okay, I'm gonna get you out.
3549420 3550820 It's okay.
3554860 3557220 Okay. Okay.
3557340 3559140 Okay, I'm gonna get you out.
3563260 3565260 No!

3580980 3583380 Fuck you! Not you!
3583500 3586380 Somebody! Anybody else!
3586460 3589980 - Please, somebody! Not you!<br />- Stop moving!
3590060 3593420 No! Get your filthy<br />fucking hands off me!
3593540 3597540 Stop moving. Lady, I'm not<br />gonna fucking hurt you!
3602300 3605260 Okay. Okay.
3605380 3607140 Please don't touch me. Don't, don't.
3607260 3610860 I'm not gonna touch you.<br />But there's nobody else here yet
3611020 3612900 and that's gasoline there.
3614500 3617620 We need to get you<br />outta here right away. Okay?
3617740 3619820 Oh, my... Oh, my...<br />Oh, my... Oh, my God.
3619940 3625380 Okay. I need to reach across your lap.<br />Can I do that, please?
3628540 3630420 Yeah. Yeah.
3631780 3633380 Thanks.
3637180 3640780 Is anything broken?
3640900 3643220 I-I don't think so.
3643340 3646140 Okay. Then that's good.
3646220 3648620 Are you... Are you<br />gonna get me out?
3648780 3651900 Yeah, I'm gonna get you out. Okay?
3651980 3655180 Look at me. Look at me.<br />I'm gonna get you out.
3661140 3662540 Oh, fuck!
3662660 3665500 - I'm sorry.<br />- That's okay.
3667540 3670220 I'm gonna have to cut your belt, okay?
3670340 3672340 I'm gonna have to cut the belt.
3673420 3674820 It's okay, it's okay.
3674980 3677460 It's okay.<br />Okay, we're gonna get you out.
3677580 3679780 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />Look at me!
3679900 3682260 Everything's gonna be fine.<br />We're gonna get you outta here.
3682380 3684100 Everything's gonna be fine.
3699980 3702340 Ryan!
3736180 3737540 Pull!
3752220 3753460 It's okay.
3762540 3763940 It's okay.
3764860 3768340 All right.<br />It's okay, it's okay.
3768460 3770820 It's all right.<br />I got it. I got it.
3770940 3772820 Ma'am? Ma'am,<br />can you walk with me?
3772940 3775220 It's cool, it's cool.
3776580 3779420 Here we go.<br />All right, you're doin' great.
3809380 3812420 The D.A. wanted me to apologize.<br />He really wanted to be here himself.
3812540 3815140 No, he didn't! If he did his own dirty work<br />none of us would have jobs.
3815260 3817420 - Jake Flanagan. I work with Rick.<br />- Graham Waters.
3817540 3820260 - Thanks for coming in.<br />- He just pulled into the garage.
3820340 3823340 Great. Press conference is in ten minutes,<br />so we'll make this short.
3823460 3826660 Internal Affairs says this Conklin<br />has two suspicious shootings on his record.
3826780 3829900 Both black men.<br />Both times he was cleared, but only just.
3830020 3832700 Detective Lewis<br />makes black man number three.
3832780 3836100 You know any reason why<br />we shouldn't hang Conklin for this?
3836260 3841020 Well, it's more complicated<br />than we originally thought.
3841180 3846820 We found $300,000 in the trunk of the car<br />that Detective Lewis was driving.
3846900 3848860 Shit!
3848980 3853300 Ah. Go down to the garage. Tell him<br />to stay in the car until he hears from me.
3853420 3857140 You found the money in the Mercedes.<br />I thought that wasn't his car.
3857260 3861260 The car's registered to a Cindy Bradley.<br />We haven't been able to get in touch with her.
3861380 3864380 Apparently she, uh,<br />left town this morning.
3864460 3868100 So it wasn't Lewis's car. He may not have<br />known the money was in it.
3874260 3877380 You really think you're gonna<br />be able to make that fly?
3879020 3880060 Give us a minute.
3881620 3883700 No problem.
3890900 3893020 Who knows about the money?
3893100 3895060 You gotta be kiddin' me.
3895180 3898860 There are only two people<br />in this room.
3899020 3902180 Myself, my partner,<br />Ferguson and Internal Affairs.
3902300 3904660 - Jim Ferguson?<br />- Yeah.
3909020 3911340 Okay. I guess<br />I don't see a problem.
3911460 3913860 As it wasn't Lewis's car, the money isn't<br />clear evidence of any wrongdoing.
3913980 3916820 And even if it was, we aren't<br />going to prosecute a dead man.
3916940 3921140 Which means the money Internal Affairs<br />is holding can't be considered evidence.
3921220 3923460 You can do this dance if you want to,
3923540 3926860 but I'm willing to bet when the coroner's report<br />comes back tomorrow
3926980 3929820 it's going to say that Detective Lewis<br />was coked out of his head.
3931220 3932620 Fucking black people, huh?
3932740 3934660 What did you just say?
3934820 3936700 I mean,
3936780 3939180 I know all the sociological<br />reasons why per capita
3939340 3942260 eight times more black men<br />are incarcerated than white men.
3942340 3946060 Schools are a disgrace. Lack of opportunity.<br />Bias in the judicial system.
3946180 3948060 All that stuff.<br />All that stuff!
3948140 3952060 But still, it's gotta get to you,<br />on a gut level as a black man,
3952140 3954980 they just can't keep their hands<br />out of the cookie jar.
3959980 3961980 Of course, you and I<br />know that's not the truth.
3962100 3964020 But that's the way<br />it always plays, doesn't it?
3964140 3967460 And assholes like Lewis keep<br />feeding the flames. It's gotta get to you.
3968660 3970860 What did you say<br />you did for the D.A. again?
3970980 3972860 You coach ball down in Compton.<br />Am I right?
3972940 3974820 Oh, please, don't do that.
3975580 3977620 Don't act like you know<br />something about me, okay?
3977740 3981940 What do you think those kids need...<br />to make them believe, to give them hope?
3982060 3984100 You think they need another<br />drug-dealing cop
3984220 3987020 or do you think they need<br />a fallen black hero?
3987140 3991540 Why don't you cut through the bullshit<br />and just tell me what it is you want.
3993460 3996140 The D.A.'s squad loses<br />its lead investigator next month.
3996260 3999980 Rick is quite adamant<br />that his replacement be a person of color.
4000100 4004100 It's a high-profile position, and he wants<br />to send the right message to the community.
4004180 4007700 And the right message is,<br />"Look at this black boy I just bought?"
4007780 4011260 Well, fuck you very much.<br />But thanks for thinking of me.
4012580 4014860 Actually we were thinking of you.
4016180 4018100 Until we saw that.
4019020 4020140 It's your brother's file.
4021100 4023260 Twenty-something years old<br />and already three felonies.
4023340 4025940 Three strikes law. Kid's going away<br />for life for stealing a car.
4026060 4028620 Christ, that's a shitty law.
4028740 4030620 There's a warrant in there.
4030700 4034860 But still, hey, he had<br />every opportunity you had.
4037580 4039420 Fucking black people, huh?
4043620 4047860 So all, uh... all I need to do<br />to make this disappear
4047940 4050180 is to frame<br />a potentially innocent man?
4050260 4053420 What are you? The fucking defender<br />of all things white?
4053540 4057100 We're talking about a white man<br />who shot three black men.
4057220 4061740 And you're arguing with me that maybe<br />we're not being fair to him?
4061900 4064740 You know what? Maybe you're right.<br />Maybe Lewis did provoke this.
4064820 4066900 And maybe he got exactly<br />what was coming to him.
4067020 4069860 Or maybe stoned or not,<br />just being a black man in the Valley
4069980 4072220 was enough to get him killed.
4072300 4076220 There was no one there to see who shot first,<br />so there is no way to know.
4076300 4079540 Which means we<br />could get this wrong.
4081340 4084260 Maybe that's what happened with<br />your brother. Maybe we got it wrong.
4084380 4088660 Maybe Lewis isn't the only one<br />who deserves the benefit of the doubt.
4089540 4091220 You're the one closest to all this.
4091340 4093060 You need to tell us.
4096740 4099060 What does your gut tell you?
4111300 4114340 So? Graham?
4114460 4116500 What do I tell 'em?
4116620 4120340 You tell me, and I'll tell them.
4126740 4130740 Well, I think given<br />Detective Conklin's history,
4130820 4133780 it's pretty clear<br />what happened last night.
4133900 4136340 Okay.
4152300 4154460 <i>Before I get to why we're here,</i>
4154580 4158340 I know that many of you have heard<br />we had our car stolen last night.
4158460 4162660 And as you could imagine, my wife and I<br />are both pretty shaken up.
4162740 4164500 But we're okay.
4164620 4169060 And Jean and I truly appreciate all your calls<br />and your concern. Thank you.
4169140 4174500 Now, just after 9:00 p.m. last night,<br />Detective William Lewis,
4174620 4177660 an eight-year veteran of the force<br />and an active member of the black community,
4177740 4179900 was gunned down<br />by a fellow officer.
4237900 4239060 Get outta the car!
4239140 4240940 Gimme the keys!<br />Get out... What the fuck?
4242860 4244820 Whoa! What the fuck<br />are you doing, man?
4244900 4246700 Shit! You wanna get killed, nigger?
4246820 4247660 Say that again!
4249700 4251780 - Say that again!<br />- You stupid motherfucker!
4251940 4255100 Say it again, huh!<br />Call me a nigger again!
4255180 4257460 - Man, what the fuck? Get off!<br />- Fuck you!
4257540 4260260 - Shoot him!<br />- I'll blow your head off!
4260380 4263300 - Shoot this motherfucker!<br />- I swear to God, I'm gonna blow your head off!
4263420 4264500 Stop talkin' and shoot!
4265820 4268580 - Stop! Let's go! Here comes the po-po.<br />- Get off of me!
4270580 4273220 Hey, hey! Where you goin', man? Hell, no!
4273340 4275220 - Oh, shit.<br />- Anthony! Anthony!
4277700 4278900 Get the fuck outta my car!
4279020 4281180 Shit! Damn!
4281260 4283380 - What are you doin', man? Get outta the car!<br />- Fuck you!
4287220 4290420 Car 25 in pursuit of a black Navigator.<br />West bound.
4291140 4293260 I will blow you away!<br />Get the fuck out of the car!
4293380 4294740 Go on! Shoot me then!
4296420 4300580 2-2 Ida Tom Adam 3...<br />Oh, Christ!
4305900 4308020 - Get the fuck outta the car!<br />- You get the fuck outta the car!
4308100 4310380 - Get outta the fucking car!<br />- It's my fucking car!
4310500 4312740 - It's my fucking gun!<br />- Fuck, it's my gun now!
4312860 4314980 Gimme my fucking gun!
4322020 4323700 Fuck!
4325380 4329140 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4331940 4335740 Hands in plain sight!<br />Step out of the vehicle!
4338900 4341340 Slowly step out of the vehicle.
4341460 4345020 - Get out of my car.<br />- You so brave, you get outta the car, man.
4347980 4351620 Turn off the engine.<br />Throw the keys out the window.
4363780 4366980 You fucking want me?<br />Here I am, you pig fuck!
4367060 4368380 Lie face down on the ground.
4368460 4371020 - Spread your arms and legs.<br />- No, you lie face down!
4371140 4373140 Don't come any closer!<br />Down on your knees!
4373260 4375620 Fuck you! What are you gonna do?<br />Pull the fucking trigger!
4375700 4376580 On your knees now!
4376700 4379300 You get on your knees<br />and suck my fucking dick!
4379460 4382020 Do I look like<br />I'm fucking joking with you?
4382180 4383620 That's what you look like,<br />a fucking joke to me.
4383780 4385860 - This man is making threatening gestures.<br />- Threatening gestures?
4385980 4388220 You wanna see a threatening gesture?<br />I got a threatening gesture.
4388300 4391860 - I know this man! I know this man!<br />- Get back.
4391940 4394380 - Give me some space. I know this guy.<br />- Get outta the way.
4394500 4395540 Step away.
4395620 4397580 Give me some goddamn room.<br />I know this guy.
4399380 4401820 - Man, don't walk up on me!<br />- See what's happening here?
4401940 4404060 Do you wanna die here, huh?<br />Is that what you want?
4404140 4406020 'Cause these guys<br />really wanna shoot you.
4406140 4408580 And the way you're acting,<br />they'll be completely fucking justified.
4408700 4409860 Fuck you!
4409980 4413140 Fuck me? I'm not the one who's fucked here.<br />You're the one.
4413260 4416020 'Cause you're the one<br />whose head's gonna be blown off!
4416100 4417340 Officer Hanson, step away.
4417420 4420740 He's a friend of mine, okay? He's a fucking<br />friend! This man is not armed!
4420900 4423660 He's not gonna shoot you, me,<br />or anybody else, all right?
4423780 4425700 So give me two goddamn seconds.<br />Can you do that?
4425820 4428940 Lower your firearm.<br />Lower your firearm!
4433940 4437060 You startin' to understand<br />the situation?
4437180 4439740 What do you want from me?
4439820 4444180 Unless you think your wife is better off with<br />a husband who has a bloody stump for a head,
4444300 4446140 I want you to sit on that curb,<br />put your hands on your head
4446220 4448380 and do nothing until I speak with these officers.
4448460 4451300 I'm not sittin' on no curb, I'm not puttin'<br />my hands on my head for nobody.
4451460 4455260 Then stand where you are and keep your<br />hands in sight. Can you do that, huh?
4458220 4460300 Yeah, I can do that.
4460420 4462540 Good.
4462660 4466300 I told this man to stay where he is and keep his<br />hands in plain sight.
4466380 4470980 This man better be related to you by blood<br />because this is fucking nuts.
4471060 4473060 I need this favor.
4473180 4477020 You can check the guy's name, his license.<br />He's got no priors, no warrants.
4477180 4479580 I need to let him go<br />with a warning.
4479740 4484420 - What kind of fucking warning?<br />- A harsh warning.
4486860 4488660 Thank you.
4491420 4495260 You've been warned. Do you understand me?<br />Do you understand me!
4495380 4498500 You want something from me?<br />'Cause I'm right here.
4498620 4502460 - I'm trying to help you.<br />- I didn't ask for your help, did I?
4504540 4506660 Go home.
4510180 4512420 Yeah, that I can do.
4587780 4589580 Look at me.
4590980 4593540 You embarrass me.
4593660 4595660 You embarrass yourself.
4637060 4638020 Daddy's home!
4658020 4659020 - What's up?<br />- Give me my money!
4659140 4661460 - What? What money?<br />- Daddy!
4661540 4664700 - To pay for my store. Give me my money!<br />- Honey, stay inside. Elizabeth!
4664780 4666220 Give me my money!
4667740 4670660 - I want my fucking money! Give me that truck!<br />- That's not my truck!
4670820 4673060 - Daddy?<br />- Elizabeth!
4673140 4677220 Hey, you know what?<br />Hey, I got $50. Here.
4677340 4679300 Fifty dollars?<br />You took everything!
4679420 4680060 Mommy?
4681740 4683260 I'm coming, I'm coming!
4683380 4687420 - He doesn't have it.<br />- Hasn't got what?
4687500 4691580 I have it. He doesn't<br />have the impenetrable cloak!
4692740 4694300 Lara, stay outta the street!
4720780 4724300 - It's okay, Daddy.<br />- What... What?
4724420 4725780 I'll protect you.
4751940 4754500 It's okay. Daddy's okay.
4754620 4757500 It's a really good cloak.
4821860 4826620 I sent her out for groceries,<br />and that was two hours ago, Carol.
4826740 4828540 Well, you are one to talk.
4828620 4832340 You go through, like,<br />six housekeepers a year?
4832420 4835700 I'm not snapping at you!<br />I am angry.
4836900 4838900 Yes! At them! Yes!
4838980 4843140 At them, the police,<br />at Rick, at Maria,
4843260 4846820 at the dry cleaners who destroyed<br />another blouse today,
4846900 4850700 at the gardener who keeps<br />overwatering the lawn.
4850820 4851940 I...
4853100 4855540 I just thought that...
4855620 4859020 Carol, I just thought that<br />I would wake up today
4859140 4862020 and I would feel better, you know?
4862100 4865900 But I was still mad.<br />And I realized...
4866020 4869780 I realized that it had nothing<br />to do with my car being stolen.
4871740 4875340 I wake up like this<br />every morning!
4875460 4879260 I am angry all the time,<br />and I don't know why.
4879340 4882540 Carol, I don't know why! And I...
4884140 4887100 Yeah, yeah, call me back.
4887180 4888980 Bye.
4995620 4997500 Really appreciate this.
4997580 4999700 You're welcome.
5005300 5007140 So how long you been out there tonight?<br />It's cold.
5007220 5009260 Hour maybe.
5009380 5011100 Big surprise, huh?
5011180 5014340 Yeah, this ain't exactly<br />"pick up a brother" territory.
5014420 5016100 True.
5016220 5018100 So where you headed?
5018220 5020260 Anywhere the other side<br />of the hill.
5023580 5025740 That's some good music.
5025860 5027660 Mm-hmm.

5724980 5728460 she said she couldn't come get me because<br />she was getting a massage.
5728580 5730860 That's because she's a bitch.
5730980 5733700 She's been my friend for ten years.
5734820 5736660 <i>All right, honey.<br />Feel better.</i>
