4095549 4097425 Come here.
4103223 4104974 I said I was okay.
4105767 4107727 John, it was stupid of you<br />to go there.
4107728 4108937 John, it was stupid of you<br />to go there.
4109813 4112148 You have to be smarter<br />than that.
4112232 4112774 You were almost killed.
4112774 4113816 You were almost killed.
4114985 4116820 What were you thinking?
4117654 4117779 You cannot risk yourself,<br />even for me.
4117779 4120239 You cannot risk yourself,<br />even for me.
4120324 4122826 Do you understand?<br />You're too important.
4122826 4123535 Do you understand?<br />You're too important.
4123619 4126288 Do you understand?
4129166 4130292 But...
4132169 4132878 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
4132878 4135672 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
4136923 4137924 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
4137924 4139300 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
4146516 4147975 What's wrong with your eyes?
4147976 4148142 What's wrong with your eyes?
4150103 4151521 Nothing.
4161448 4163074 So, what's your story?
4163075 4163909 So, what's your story?
4174461 4175545 You okay?
4175629 4177047 Fine.
4178882 4182218 Say, that's a nice bike.
4204700 4206410 Watch it, lug nuts.
4213917 4217337 Listen, do you know<br />what you're doing?
4217421 4220215 I have detailed files<br />on human anatomy.
4221133 4222342 I bet.
4222342 4223092 I bet.
4223176 4226179 Makes you a more efficient killer,<br />right?
4226263 4227389 Correct.
4233437 4233562 Does it hurt<br />when you get shot?
4233562 4235438 Does it hurt<br />when you get shot?
4236481 4238691 I sense injuries.<br />The data could be called “pain.”
4238692 4239943 I sense injuries.<br />The data could be called “pain.”
4242279 4243780 John, help me with the light.
4243780 4244197 John, help me with the light.
4244281 4246574 - Will these heal up?<br />- Yes.
4246658 4248910 Good. If you can't pass for human,<br />you're not much good to us.
4248910 4250870 Good. If you can't pass for human,<br />you're not much good to us.
4250954 4253665 How long do you live?<br />I mean, last. Whatever.
4253749 4253999 A hundred and twenty years<br />with my existing power cell.
4253999 4257043 A hundred and twenty years<br />with my existing power cell.
4257127 4259129 Can you learn stuff that you<br />haven't been programmed with...
4259129 4260046 Can you learn stuff that you<br />haven't been programmed with...
4260130 4261548 SO you can be...
4262799 4264217 you know, more human...
4264217 4265509 you know, more human...
4265594 4268305 and not such a dork<br />all the time?
4271475 4274436 My CPU is a neural net processor,<br />a learning computer.
4274436 4275019 My CPU is a neural net processor,<br />a learning computer.
4275103 4279440 But Skynet presets the switch<br />to read-only when we're sent out alone.
4280817 4283236 Doesn't want you to do<br />too much thinking, huh?
4283320 4284654 No.
4286198 4288491 Can we reset the switch?
4306510 4310180 Rotate the two locking cylinders<br />counterclockwise.
4310180 4310972 Rotate the two locking cylinders<br />counterclockwise.
4316853 4318354 Do it.
4326655 4328990 Now open the port cover.
4331535 4334079 Pull to break the seal.
4337207 4340793 Good, now remove<br />the shock-damping assembly.
4340794 4341211 Good, now remove<br />the shock-damping assembly.
4344756 4345923 You can now access the CPU.
4345924 4347926 You can now access the CPU.
4348009 4350386 - Do you see it?<br />- Yes.
4350470 4351012 Hold the CPU by its base tab.
4351012 4354390 Hold the CPU by its base tab.
4354474 4355892 Pull.
4393263 4394973 Do you see the pin switch?
4395056 4396932 No! No!
4397934 4400561 - Out of my way, John.<br />- Don't kill him.
4400645 4402104 It, John, not him.<br />It.
4402105 4403940 It, John, not him.<br />It.
4404024 4407193 Okay, it.<br />But we need it.
4407193 4407484 Okay, it.<br />But we need it.
4407569 4410196 Listen to me.<br />You listen.
4410280 4412323 We're better off on our own.
4412324 4412407 We're better off on our own.
4412490 4414283 But he's the only proof we have...
4414367 4416869 of the future and the war<br />and all that.
4416953 4417411 Maybe.
4417412 4418329 Maybe.
4420957 4422500 I don't trust it.
4422500 4423000 I don't trust it.
4423084 4424794 But he's my friend, all right?
4425629 4427631 You don't know what it's like<br />to try to kill one of these things...
4427631 4428381 You don't know what it's like<br />to try to kill one of these things...
4428465 4432051 and if something goes wrong<br />this could be our last chance, so move!
4432135 4432718 If I'm ever supposed to be<br />this great military leader...
4432719 4434220 If I'm ever supposed to be<br />this great military leader...
4434304 4437849 maybe you should start listening<br />to my leadership ideas once in a while.
4437849 4438140 Maybe you should start listening<br />to my leadership ideas once in a while.
4441144 4442937 Because if my own mother won't,<br />how do you expect anyone else to?
4442938 4445774 Because if my own mother won't,<br />how do you expect anyone else to?
4459996 4463040 All right, play it your way.
4470507 4472550 Was there a problem?
4472634 4473593 No problem.
4473593 4474135 No problem.
4475845 4477054 None whatsoever.
4510714 4512632 Are we learning yet?
4525061 4525978 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
4525979 4528022 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
4531735 4533361 Just head south.
4542120 4543704 Keep it under 65.
4543788 4546791 - We don't want to be pulled over.<br />- Affirmative.
4550003 4552463 You gotta listen to the way<br />people talk.
4552464 4552505 You gotta listen to the way<br />people talk.
4552589 4556092 You don't say “affirmative”<br />or some shit like that.
4556176 4557760 You say, <i>“No problemo.”</i>
4557761 4558511 You say, <i>“No problemo.”</i>
4558595 4562515 If someone comes off to you<br />with an attitude, you say, “Eat me.”
4562599 4563057 And if you want to shine them on,<br />it's “l-last a <i>la</i> vista, baby.”
4563058 4566895 And if you want to shine them on,<br />it's <i>“Hasta la vista,</i> baby.”
4570106 4572233 Yeah, or “Later, dick-wad.”
4572317 4573651 If someone gets upset,<br />you say, “Chill out.”
4573651 4575361 If someone gets upset,<br />you say, “Chill out.”
4575445 4576821 Or you can do combinations.
4577614 4578948 Chill out, dick-wad.
4578948 4579907 Chill out, dick-wad.
4580742 4582744 That's great.<br />See? You're getting it.
4594964 4596840 You got any cash?
4596925 4600178 I got a couple hundred bucks.<br />I'll give you half.
4600178 4600469 I got a couple hundred bucks.<br />I'll give you half.
4600553 4602221 Mom!
4603389 4605391 Get some food.
4607393 4609812 No sense of humor.
4615235 4616152 That's another thing.<br />You can lighten up a bit yourself.
4616152 4618821 That's another thing.<br />You can lighten up a bit yourself.
4619739 4621490 This severe routine<br />is getting old, okay.
4621491 4621908 This severe routine<br />is getting old, okay.
4621991 4623826 I mean, you're acting<br />like such a geek.
4623910 4625912 Smile once in a while.
4625995 4626829 Smile?
4626830 4627330 Smile?
4627413 4631333 Yeah, you know, smile.<br />Watch.
4632335 4636047 Hi. Nice place you got here.<br />How's business?
4637006 4637464 Give me a break.
4637465 4638841 Give me a break.
4639759 4641761 Okay, bad example.
4642887 4644555 See that guy over there?
4644639 4646515 That's a smile.
4665869 4667328 That's good.
4667412 4669455 Maybe you could practice<br />in front of a mirror or something.
4669455 4670372 Maybe you could practice<br />in front of a mirror or something.
4677630 4679548 Want some of my fries?

4690768 4692019 - Need any help?<br />- No.
4693438 4695189 - I got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4703531 4706534 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4708578 4709787 People, I mean.
4712957 4714792 It's in your nature<br />to destroy yourselves.
4715877 4717420 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4717420 4718796 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4718880 4722133 Break it up before I wring<br />both of your necks.
4723927 4727013 I need to know<br />how Skynet gets built.
4727096 4728055 Who's responsible?
4728056 4728347 Who's responsible?
4728431 4731976 The man most directly responsible<br />is Miles Bennett Dyson.
4732060 4733394 Who is that?
4733394 4733769 Who is that?
4733853 4737773 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
4740568 4742319 Why him?
4742403 4744071 In a few months, he creates<br />a revolutionary type of microprocessor.
4744072 4745782 In a few months, he creates<br />a revolutionary type of microprocessor.
4746824 4748158 Go on. Then what?
4749285 4749410 In three years Cyberdyne will become<br />the largest supplier...
4749410 4752204 In three years Cyberdyne will become<br />the largest supplier...
4752288 4753664 of military computer systems.
