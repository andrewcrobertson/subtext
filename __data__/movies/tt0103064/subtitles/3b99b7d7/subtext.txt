1310561 1313564 If I had , there would have been<br />some evidence.

2213839 2217300 Not like me.<br />A T-1 000, advanced prototype.
2219010 2223432 - More advanced than you are?<br />- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
2224349 2226768 - What the hell does that mean?<br />- Liquid metal.
2228520 2229646 Where are we going?
2229855 2231606 We have to get out of the city<br />immediately
2231815 2233066 and avoid the authorities.
2233859 2236528 Listen , I got to stop by my house.<br />I want to pick up some stuff.
2236736 2240699 Negative. The T-1 000 would definitely<br />try to reacquire you there.
2240907 2243577 - You sure?<br />- I would .
2254337 2256923 Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...
2259259 2260594 ... but I gotta warn them .
2260802 2263138 Shit! You got a quarter?
2267267 2269269 (Phone ringing)
2271980 2274858 - Hello.<br />- 'Janelle, it's me.'
2275066 2277277 - John?<br />- 'Yeah . Is everything all right?'
2277486 2279779 - Are you guys OK?<br />- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'
2279988 2282991 - Are you all right?<br />- 'Yeah , I'm fine.'
2283200 2286661 John , it's late.<br />I was beginning to worry about you .
2286870 2289414 If you hurry home, we can sit down<br />and have dinner together.
2289623 2291041 I'm making beef stew.
2291249 2293335 Something's wrong .<br />She's never this nice.
2293543 2295921 - John , where are you?<br />- (Dog barking)
2296129 2298882 What the hell is the goddamn dog<br />barking at?
2299090 2302219 Hey, shut up,<br />you worthless piece of shit!
2302427 2303762 The dog's really barking .
2303970 2306056 You were gonna tell the kid<br />to get rid of that fucking mutt.
2308767 2309893 (Thud)
2310101 2312729 John , honey, it's late.<br />Please don't make me worry.
2312938 2316942 - Could he already be there?<br />- Honey, are you OK?
2317150 2319319 (John's voice)<br />I'm right here. I'm fine.
2319528 2321029 'Are you sure you're all right?'
2321238 2324032 - (Own voice) What's the dog's name?<br />- Max.
2324658 2326868 (John's voice) Janelle, what's wrong<br />with Wolfie?
2327077 2329538 I can hear him barking . Is he OK?
2329746 2332415 Wolfie's fine, honey.<br />Wolfie's just fine.
2333750 2335252 Where are you?
2337045 2338922 Your foster parents are dead .
2375917 2377919 No, no. I need a minute here.
2378128 2382299 You're telling me that this thing<br />can imitate anything it touches?
2382507 2384843 Anything it samples<br />by physical contact.
2385051 2386845 Get real.
2387053 2390682 It could disguise itself<br />as a pack of cigarettes?
2390890 2392559 No, only an object of equal size.
2392767 2395186 Why not just become a bomb<br />or something to get me?
2395395 2397439 It can't form complex machines.
2397647 2399608 Guns and explosives<br />have chemicals, moving parts.
2399816 2401109 It doesn't work that way.
2401318 2404112 - But it can form solid metal shapes.<br />- Like what?
2404321 2406323 Knives and stabbing weapons.
2407240 2409576 (Weatherby) These were taken<br />by a video surveillance camera
2409784 2413163 at the West Highland Police Station<br />in 1 984.
2414664 2417584 He killed<br />1 7 police officers that night.
2419210 2421338 Men with families...
2422714 2424299 ...children .
2425800 2430138 These were taken at a mall<br />in Reseda today.
2431514 2435435 (Weatherby) M iss Connor,<br />we know you know who this guy is.
2437604 2441900 Look, I just sat here and told you<br />that your son is missing .
2442108 2443985 That the foster parents<br />have been murdered .
2444194 2446446 We know this guy's involved .
2447656 2451493 Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br />Don't you care?
2455872 2462003 - We're wasting our time. Let's go.<br />- (Silberman) Sorry, guys.
2462212 2464714 She's grown more and more<br />disconnected from reality
2464923 2466424 as time goes on .
2466633 2468301 I'm afraid she can't help us now.
2468510 2472180 If she clears at all and can<br />give us anything , I'll call you .
2472389 2473723 (Weatherby) Sure.
2473932 2476685 Douglas,<br />take her back to her room , please.
2476893 2477977 (Douglas) Yes, sir.
2479646 2481690 Come on , sweetheart. Let's go.
2481898 2486861 You see, we spent a lot of time<br />in Nicaragua and places like that.
2488988 2492617 For a while there, she was with<br />this crazy ex-Green Beret guy
2492909 2494035 running guns.
2494244 2497080 Then there were some other guys.
2497288 2499040 She'd shack up with anybody<br />she could learn from
2499249 2502460 so she could teach me how to be<br />this great military leader.
2504337 2506256 Then she gets busted .
2506464 2509968 It's like, "Sorry, kid . Your mom's<br />a psycho. Didn't you know?"
2512303 2514222 It's like everything<br />I'd been brought up to believe
2514431 2516182 was all made-up bullshit.
2516391 2518810 I hated her for that.
2522147 2524774 But everything she said was true.
2526151 2528027 She knew.
2530280 2532282 And nobody believed her.
2534117 2535952 Not even me.
2537996 2539748 Listen ,<br />we gotta get her out of there.
2539956 2543293 Negative. The T-1 000's<br />highest probability for success now
2543501 2544711 will be to copy Sarah Connor
2544919 2546421 and wait for you<br />to make contact with her.
2546629 2548590 Great. What happens to her?
2548798 2551551 Typically, the subject<br />being copied is terminated .
2551760 2554721 Shit! Why didn't you tell me?<br />We gotta go right now!
2554929 2557056 Negative.<br />It's not a mission priority.
2557265 2559267 Fuck you ! She's a priority to me!
2561144 2563980 Goddamn it!<br />What's your problem? Damn it!
2564189 2567025 - Help! Help!<br />- This does not help our mission .
2567233 2569569 Get this psycho off of me! Help!
2569778 2572697 Help! I'm being kidnapped !<br />Get this psycho off of me!
2572906 2573823 Let me go!
2578495 2582123 - Why the hell did you do that?<br />- Because you told me to.
2584959 2586628 What?
2591466 2593426 You have to do what I say, huh?
2593635 2595720 That's one of my mission parameters.
2597013 2600517 Prove it. Stand on one foot.
2602727 2604062 Yes!
2606272 2609859 Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
2611361 2614072 - You OK, kid?<br />- Take a hike, bozo.
2614280 2618701 - Let's get outta here, man .<br />- Fuck you , you little dipshit!
2619536 2621120 Dipshit?
2623164 2625166 Put your leg down .
2625375 2630046 - Did you call <i>mol</i> a dipshit?<br />- Just trying to help this punk.
2630255 2632507 Grab this guy.<br />I can't believe he called me...
2632715 2635343 Agh ! God ! Get him off of me!
2635552 2638596 Now who's the dipshit,<br />you jock douche bag?
2638805 2640014 Get off me!
2646229 2647355 - No!<br />- (Gunshot)
2648606 2650900 Put the gun down , now!
2651109 2654279 - Get outta here!<br />- Come on . Let's split!
2661286 2663121 Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!
2663329 2665331 Of course. I'm a Terminator.
2667667 2670211 Listen to me very carefully, OK?
2670420 2673631 You're not a Terminator anymore,<br />all right?
2673840 2675925 You got that?
2676134 2678469 You just can't go around<br />killing people.
2678678 2679554 Why?
2680513 2682682 What do you mean , why?<br />Cos you can't.
2682891 2683725 Why?
2683933 2686603 Because you just can't.<br />Trust me on this.
2692650 2696112 Look, I'm gonna go get my mom .
2696321 2699741 And I order you to help me.
2713463 2715673 (Operator on police radio)
2765932 2767684 Hm !
2785076 2787912 (Clattering)

2845470 2846512 Hi!
2846721 2850767 - You have a Sarah Connor here?<br />- You're running late, aren't you?
2850975 2853227 They've been in there for an hour.
2853436 2855772 Hold on a second . I'll buzz you in .
2857648 2860276 Oh , here come your friends now.
2869869 2870953 (Buzzer)
2879962 2881881 (Officer) Well, that was productive.

3130296 3132089 You broke my arm .
3132298 3134884 There are 21 5 bones<br />in the human body.
3135092 3137636 That's one. Now, don't move.
3143642 3145311 What are you gonna do?
3148939 3150983 Why do we stop now?
3152318 3156030 You gotta promise me<br />you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
3156238 3158699 - Right.<br />- Swear?
3158908 3160284 What?
3160493 3163496 Just put up your hand and say,<br />"I swear I won't kill anyone."

3220469 3222138 Let's try to remain calm .
3222346 3224140 Open it, or he'll be dead<br />before he hits the floor.
3224348 3226267 There's no way, Connor. Let him go.
3226475 3228602 (Sarah) Open the door.<br />(Guard) It ain't gonna happen .
3228811 3230646 Take it easy, Sarah . Easy.
3230855 3232481 It won't work, Sarah .<br />You're no killer.
3232690 3234024 I don't believe you can do it.
3234233 3235484 You're already dead , Silberman .

3640472 3641723 Ready!
3647312 3648647 John !
3655737 3657364 Here, drive.
3661618 3662703 (Gunshot)
3711043 3713045 He's not back there.<br />There's nobody behind us.
3713253 3715422 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah .
3717674 3720969 - Can you even see anything?<br />- I see everything .
3724139 3725599 Cool.
3729353 3730896 Come here.
3737027 3738654 I said I was OK.
3739613 3742574 John ,<br />it was stupid of you to go there.
3743700 3745827 God damnit! You have to be<br />smarter than that.
3746036 3747496 You almost got yourself killed .
3748872 3750457 What were you thinking?
3751500 3754002 You cannot risk yourself,<br />even for me.
3754211 3755545 Do you understand?
3755754 3759925 You're too important.<br />Do you understand?
3762928 3763929 But...
3765764 3769351 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
3770727 3772938 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
3780278 3781780 What's wrong with your eyes?
3783949 3785283 Nothing .
3795293 3797587 So, what's your story?
3800382 3803885 (Sirens wail, radios crackle)
3808181 3809224 You OK?
3809433 3810851 Fine.
3812769 3815856 Say, that's a nice bike.
3837878 3840005 (John) Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.
3843008 3846219 (Hissing)
3847846 3850807 Listen ,<br />do you know what you're doing?
3851016 3853852 I have detailed files<br />on human anatomy.
3854811 3859775 I bet! Makes you<br />a more efficient killer, right?
3859983 3861026 Correct.
3867365 3869076 Does it hurt when you get shot?
3870410 3873497 I sense injuries.<br />The data could be called "pain".
3876208 3878001 John , help me with the light.
3878210 3880045 - Will these heal up?<br />- Yes.
3880253 3884674 Good . If you can't pass for a human ,<br />you're not much good to us.
3884883 3887844 How long do you live?<br />I mean , last. Whatever.
3888053 3890722 1 20 years<br />with my existing power cell.
3890931 3893767 Can you learn stuff that<br />you haven't been programmed with ,
3893975 3895644 so you can be...
3896728 3901233 ...you know, more human ,<br />and not such a dork all the time?
3903735 3907322 My CPU is a neural net processor,<br />a learning computer.
3907531 3911243 The more contact I have with humans,<br />the more I learn .
3911451 3913078 (John) Cool.
3941231 3943066 (Engine starts)
3944526 3946027 Are we learning yet?
3950198 3951491 Mom !
3959040 3962002 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
3965922 3967757 Just head south .
3976308 3977767 Keep it under 65.
3977976 3980604 - We don't wanna be pulled over.<br />- Affirmative.
3981438 3986318 No, no, no. You gotta listen<br />to the way people talk.
3986526 3989946 You don't say "affirmative"<br />or some shit like that.
3990155 3992324 You say, <i>"No Problemo."</i>
3992532 3996328 And if someone comes up to you<br />with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"
3996536 4000665 And if you want to shine them on ,<br />it's <i>"Hasta la vlsta,</i> baby."
4001541 4003293 (Monotone) <i>Hasta la vlsta,</i> baby.
4004336 4006046 Yeah , or "Later, dick-wad ."
4006254 4009049 And if someone gets upset,<br />you say, "Chill out."
4009257 4013678 - Or you can do combinations.<br />- Chill out, dick-wad .
4014596 4016514 That's great. See? You're getting it.
4016723 4018642 <i>No Problemo.</i>
4020101 4022062 (Truck horn blasts)
4033365 4035158 Want some of my fries?
4045460 4048964 - Need any help?<br />- No.
4049172 4052550 - I got you !<br />- No, you didn't!
4052759 4054594 I did !<br />I came round here and I got you !
4054803 4058473 No, you didn't!
4059349 4061476 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4064271 4065522 People, I mean .
4068525 4070527 It's in your nature<br />to destroy yourselves.
4071695 4074322 Yeah . Major drag , huh?
4074531 4077409 (Woman) Break it up<br />before I wring both of your necks.
4079536 4083873 I need to know how Skynet gets built,<br />who's responsible.
4084082 4087544 The man most directly responsible<br />is M iles Bennett Dyson .
4088461 4089587 (John) Who is that?
4089796 4092924 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation .
4096219 4097846 Why him?
4098054 4100307 I n a few months he creates<br />a revolutionary type
4100515 4101766 of microprocessor.
4102517 4105770 - Go on . Then what?<br />- I n three years,
4105979 4107939 Cyberdyne will become the largest<br />supplier
4108148 4109399 of military computer systems.
4110400 4113194 All Stealth bombers are upgraded<br />with Cyberdyne computers,
4113403 4114738 becoming fully unmanned .
4114946 4118074 Afterwards, they fly<br />with a pertect operational record .
4118283 4120660 The Skynet Funding bill is passed .
4120869 4124164 The system goes on-line<br />on August 41 997.
4124372 4127292 Human decisions are removed<br />from strategic defence.
4127500 4130211 Skynet begins to learn<br />at a geometric rate.
4130420 4134591 It becomes self-aware at 02: 1 4am<br />Eastern time, August 29.
4135759 4138094 I n a panic,<br />they try to pull the plug .
4139429 4141639 - Skynet fights back.<br />- Yes.
4141848 4144351 It launches its missiles<br />against the targets in Russia.
4144559 4147604 Why attack Russia?<br />Aren't they our friends now?
4147812 4150065 Because Skynet knows<br />that the Russian counterattack
4150273 4152067 will eliminate its enemies over here.
4152275 4153777 Jesus!
4157197 4158365 How much do you know about Dyson?
4160617 4162369 I have detailed files.
4163745 4165497 I wanna know everything .
4166915 4170877 What he looks like,<br />where he lives, everything .
4199489 4201116 Wait in the car.
4204202 4206246 (Wind howling)
4219676 4221553 Enrique!
4221761 4224097 (I n Spanish) Are you here?
4239529 4240864 (I n English)<br />You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
4243283 4249080 (Continues in Spanish)<br />And you . . . are always like a snake.
4249289 4250999 (Laughs)
4251207 4253209 (I n Spanish) It's great<br />to see you , Connor!
4253418 4254461 I told you I would be back.
4254669 4257380 (Enrique) I knew you would .<br />It's good to see you .
4257589 4258423 Jolanda!
4258631 4261843 Get out here, we got company.<br />And bring some tequila.
4262051 4265180 - Hey, big John . <i>¿ Cómo te va ?</i><br />- What's up?
4265388 4267098 (Continues in Spanish)<br />Who's this big guy?
4267307 4272270 He's cool, Enrique.<br />He's with me. He's, er. . . Uncle Bob.
4272479 4274314 Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
4274522 4276941 Uncle Bob, huh?
4277525 4280028 (Laughing) OK. OK!
4281404 4282489 (Continues in Spanish) How are you?
4282697 4285992 How are you?<br />You've grown so much .
4286201 4287702 (I n English) Drink?
4291998 4293249 Uncle Bob?
4294334 4298338 (Enrique) Hey, Sarita! You're pretty<br />famous, all over the goddamn TV.
4298546 4301090 Pictures of you , John ,<br />your big friend here.
4301299 4304010 (Laughing) Cops are going nuts<br />looking for you .
4304219 4306721 (I ndistinct dialogue in Spanish)
4306930 4308056 I just came for my stuff.
4308264 4310725 I need clothes,<br />food and one of your trucks.
4310934 4312894 How about the fillings<br />out of my fucking teeth?
4313102 4315605 Now, Enrique!
4316648 4320443 - You two, you're on weapons detail.<br />- Come on . Let's go.
4341339 4343758 One thing about my mom ...
4345593 4347720 ...she always plans ahead .
4358273 4359232 Excellent.
4363778 4365780 (I ndistinct dialogue in Spanish)
4365989 4368241 (Tries to start engine)
4370076 4373621 This is my best truck I got,<br />but the starter motor's gone.
4373830 4375623 You got time to change it out?
4375832 4378876 Yeah . I'm gonna wait till dark<br />to cross the border.
4381546 4383464 (John) See,<br />I grew up in places like this,
4383673 4385842 so I just thought<br />that's how people lived ,
4386050 4390555 riding around in helicopters,<br />learning how to blow shit up.
4395435 4397061 That's definitely you .
4408698 4411284 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung around with were geeks,
4411492 4415163 but there was this one guy,<br />he was kinda cool.
4415371 4418541 - He taught me engines.<br />- Hold here.
4419500 4421919 Mom screwed it up, of course.
4422128 4424172 She'd always tell 'em about<br />Judgment Day
4424380 4426758 and me being this world leader.
4427550 4431554 - That'd be all she wrote.<br />- Torque wrench , please.
4433973 4435058 Here.
4436100 4440521 - I wish I could've met my real dad .<br />- You will.
4440730 4445318 Yeah , I guess.<br />When I'm , like, 45, I think.
4446611 4449781 I sent him back through time<br />to 1 984.
4450615 4451866 Man !
4453576 4455870 He hasn't even been born yet.
4457622 4459582 It messes with your head .
4462210 4464837 - The other bolt.<br />- Oh . Here.
4471803 4475223 Mom and him were only together<br />for one night.
4475431 4480603 She still loves him , I guess.<br />I see her crying sometimes.
4480812 4482230 She denies it totally, of course,
4482438 4485233 like she got something<br />stuck in her eye.
4489487 4490988 Why do you cry?
4492115 4493908 - You mean people?<br />- Yeah .
4494117 4496577 I don't know. We just cry.
4497537 4499872 You know, when it hurts.
4506170 4511175 - Pain causes it?<br />- Er. . . no. It's different.
4511384 4514345 It's when there's nothing wrong<br />with you , but you hurt anyways.
4514554 4515972 - Get it?<br />- No.
4516180 4517140 (Engine starts)
4517348 4518933 All right, my man !
4519142 4522353 <i>- No Problemo.</i><br />- Give me five.
4524897 4526816 Just put out your hand , like this.
4528192 4531904 All right! Now hit me.<br />Give me five. Do the same thing .
4532113 4534157 (Slap) All right!
4534365 4536242 (Groans)
4537076 4539412 OK, that's good . Up high ! High five!
4540538 4541664 Five low.
4541873 4543374 (Laughs) Too slow.
4546544 4548671 I'm just kidding . One more time.
4548880 4550965 (Slap) Good . Now try it. Good !
4551174 4552925 Now do me. Give me five.
4554635 4556637 (Sarah) 'Watching John<br />with the machine,
4556846 4559015 it was suddenly so clear.
4559223 4562185 'The Terminator would never stop.
4562393 4566063 'It would never leave him<br />and it would never hurt him ,
4566272 4569692 'never shout at him<br />or get drunk and hit him
4569901 4572195 'or say it was too busy<br />to spend time with him .

4805678 4808097 (Enrique) She said you go south<br />with him like you planned .
4808305 4811308 - She'll meet you tomorrow.<br />- Mom !
4811517 4813269 Mom , wait!
4828743 4830453 "No fate".
4831787 4833998 "No fate, but what we make."
4836167 4837793 My father told her this.
4840796 4845384 I mean , I made him memorise it<br />in the future as a message to her.
4846635 4851807 Never mind .<br />Now, OK, the whole thing goes...
4852016 4854643 The future's not set.
4854852 4858272 There's no fate,<br />but what we make for ourselves.
4858481 4862985 - She intends to change the future.<br />- Yeah , I guess.
4864445 4866155 Oh , shit!
4866363 4868157 - Dyson .<br />- Yeah .
4868365 4871744 Gotta be. M iles Dyson .

4876123 4877792 Let's go! Come on !
4888552 4891555 - This is tactically dangerous.<br />- Drive faster.
4891764 4895518 The T-1 000 has the same files<br />that I do. It knows what I know.
4895726 4900231 - It might anticipate this move.<br />- I don't care. We gotta stop her.
4900439 4902817 Killing Dyson might prevent the war.
4903025 4904735 I don't care!
4904944 4906737 Haven't you learned anything yet?
4906946 4909115 Haven't you figured out<br />why you can't kill people?
4915329 4917748 (Woman) Danny, I told you<br />to go to bed . I'm not kidding .

5178258 5180052 No shattered bone.
5180260 5183055 You hold here. The pressure<br />should stop the bleeding .
5193982 5197152 - Who are you people?<br />- Show him .
5200447 5204493 Danny, I want you to come with me<br />right now. Show me your room .

5272436 5275022 'He took it pretty well.'
5276440 5279026 I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
5285532 5290120 You're judging me<br />on things I haven't even done yet.
5293874 5296502 How were we supposed to know?
5298587 5300214 Yeah !
5300422 5301924 Right.
5302841 5305928 How were you supposed to know?
5306136 5309723 Fucking men like you<br />built the hydrogen bomb.
5309932 5314144 Men like you thought it up.
5317940 5320984 You think you're so creative.
5321193 5324238 You don't know what it's like<br />to really create something ,
5324446 5328033 to create a life,<br />to feel it growing inside you .
5328242 5330494 All you know how to create<br />is death and destruction .
5330702 5332079 Mom !
5333038 5336667 We need to be a little more<br />constructive here. OK?
5336875 5338835 We still have to stop this<br />from happening , don't we?
5339044 5340754 But I thought...
5341964 5345801 Aren't we changing things right now,<br />changing the way it goes?
5346009 5349555 That's right. There's no way<br />I'm gonna finish the new processor.
5349763 5352432 Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.
5352641 5356228 - I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.<br />- That's not good enough .
5356436 5359439 - No one must follow your work.<br />- Right.
5360524 5364361 All right, then we have to destroy<br />all the stuff at the lab:
5364570 5368991 the files, the disk drives,<br />everything , everything here.
5369825 5372661 Everything . I don't care.
5374663 5375455 The chip.
5376081 5377624 - Do you know about the chip?<br />- What chip?
5377833 5379334 They keep it in a vault<br />at Cyberdyne.
5379543 5380794 It must be from<br />the other one like you .
5381003 5385382 - The CPU from the first Terminator.<br />- Son of a bitch ! I knew it!
5385591 5388176 They told us<br />not to ask where they got it.
5388385 5390596 Those lying mothertuckers.
5390804 5392472 It's scary stuff. Radically advanced .
5392681 5394808 I mean ,<br />it was smashed , it didn't work,
5395017 5396393 but it gave us ideas,
5396602 5399479 took us in new directions,<br />things we would've never th ...
5401732 5403734 All my work was based on it.
5403942 5405611 It must be destroyed .
5407946 5410907 Can you get us in? Past security?
5411116 5414036 I think so, yeah . When?
