870453 871913 This next patient is interesting.
872122 874583 I've been following<br />the case for years.
874791 876793 A 29-year-old female,
879212 881756 diagnosed as acute<br />schizo-affective disorder.
881965 884009 The usual indicators:<br />depression, anxiety,
884217 886761 violent acting out,<br />delusions of persecution.
893435 896563 The delusional architecture<br />is fairly unique.
896771 899608 She believes that a machine<br />called the Terminator,
899816 901026 which looked human, of course,
901234 903820 was sent back through time<br />to kill her.
904029 905155 That's original.
905363 908074 And also,<br />that the father of her child
908283 911119 was a soldier<br />sent back to protect her.
911328 913622 - No?<br />- He was from the future too.
913830 918627 The year 2029,<br />if I remember correctly.

927052 930889 Good morning, Dr Silberman.<br />How's the knee?
932807 934684 Fine, Sarah.
935894 941066 She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap<br />with my pen a few weeks ago.
941900 943234 Repeated escape attempts...
953578 955664 Let's move on, shall we?
955872 956872 Lewis,
956915 959515 I don't like to see the patients<br />disrupting their rooms like this.
959709 962796 - See she takes her Thorazine.<br />- Sure. I'll take care of it.
975558 977435 Time to take you meds, Connor.
978395 979979 You take it.
980480 983358 You gotta be good.<br />You're up for review this afternoon.
983983 985360 I'm not taking it.
985944 988822 - I don't want any trouble.<br />- Ain't no trouble...

1049299 1051676 That's right, Officer.<br />What's he done now?
1052510 1055221 - Could I speak with him, please?<br />- You could if he were here.
1055430 1058141 He took off on his bike this morning<br />so he could be anywhere.
1058349 1061853 - Do you have a photograph of John?<br />- Yeah. Hold on.
1064814 1067150 You gonna tell me what this is about?
1067358 1069235 I just need to ask him<br />a few questions.
1071696 1074699 He's a good-looking boy.<br />Do you mind if I keep this picture?
1074908 1078161 No, go on. There was a guy here<br />this morning looking for him, too.
1078369 1080079 Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
1080288 1082207 Has that got something<br />to do with this?
1084626 1088463 No. I wouldn't worry about him.

1142684 1145478 - Is that her?<br />- Yes.
1145687 1149732 - She's pretty cool, huh?<br />- No, she's a complete psycho.
1149941 1153570 That's why she's at Pescadero.<br />It's a mental institute, OK?
1154445 1156322 She tried to blow up<br />a computer factory,
1156531 1157824 but she got shot and arrested.

1209834 1211377 Where's our son, Sarah?
1212462 1214547 They took him away from me.
1214881 1218009 - He's the target now.<br />- I know!
1218217 1220094 He's alone.<br />You have to protect him.
1220303 1221596 I know.
1222639 1224557 You tell me how I am supposed<br />to do that.
1225350 1226976 He doesn't even<br />believe me anymore.
1228227 1229312 I've lost him.
1229646 1231272 You're strong, Sarah.
1231606 1233816 - Stronger than you ever thought.<br />- No.
1235276 1236611 On your feet, soldier!
1238780 1241240 I love you. I always will.
1243868 1246704 - I need you.<br />- I'll always be with you.
1251167 1252835 Remember the message?
1254545 1256005 "The future is not set.
1257382 1260843 "There is no fate<br />but what we make for ourselves."
1281197 1282448 Stay with me.
1283658 1286077 There's not much time left<br />in the world, Sarah.
1293835 1295545 Kyle, don't go!
1307765 1309017 Kyle!
1381672 1384926 It's like a giant strobe light,
1385635 1387512 burning right to my eyes.
1392058 1394143 Somehow I can still see.
1405780 1408866 We know<br />the dream's the same every night.
1409242 1412411 - Why do I have to...<br />- Please continue.
1416332 1418835 Children look like burnt paper.
1420586 1422046 Black.
1423005 1424632 Not moving.
1426551 1429387 And then the blast wave hits them.
1438354 1440773 And they fly apart like leaves.
1442733 1447905 Dreams of cataclysm,<br />the end of the world are very common.
1449907 1453995 It's not a dream, you moron.<br />It's real.
1454203 1457957 - I know the date it happens.<br />- I'm sure it feels very real to you.
1458166 1463254 On August 29 1997, it's gonna feel<br />pretty fuckin' real to you, too!
1464547 1466924 Anybody not wearing<br />two-million sunblock
1467133 1469635 is gonna have<br />a real bad day. Get it?
1470136 1472847 God! You think you're safe and alive.
1473055 1475224 You're already dead. Everybody!
1475433 1477852 Him. You. You're dead already.
1478060 1480813 This whole place,<br />everything you see is gone!
1481022 1483983 You're the one<br />living in a fucking dream, Silberman!
1484192 1484984 Cos I know it happened!
1485193 1486777 It happened!
1498080 1499999 I feel much better now.
1501209 1502960 Clearer.
1503169 1508507 Yes, your attitude has been<br />much improved lately.
1517725 1520061 It's helped me to have a goal,
1520853 1523314 something to look forward to.
1523522 1524565 What is that?
1525441 1530905 Well, you said that if I showed<br />improvement after six months,
1531113 1533658 you would transfer me<br />to the minimum security wing
1533866 1536953 and I could have visitors.
1538246 1541540 Well, it's been six months and...
1543459 1545586 I was looking forward<br />to seeing my son.
1546796 1548297 I see.
1551467 1556555 Let's go back to what you were saying<br />about those Terminator machines.
1556764 1560017 Now you think they don't exist?
1560226 1562436 They don't exist.
1562645 1564230 I know that now.
1564438 1566232 But you've told me<br />on many occasions
1566440 1569777 about how you crushed one<br />in a hydraulic press.
1571153 1574156 If I had, there would have been<br />some evidence.
1574365 1576659 They would have found something<br />at the factory.
1576867 1578869 I see.
1579078 1582915 So, you don't believe any more<br />that the company covered it up?
1585084 1587545 No. Why would they?
1588462 1590715 Let's try a new position right there.
1590923 1595094 The neuronal sensors are correct,<br />because it works.
1595303 1597805 - Right.<br />- Those neurons are all centred.
1598681 1600683 Maybe<br />the inhibitor circuits failed...
1600891 1601976 Mr Dyson?
1602810 1605855 Mr Dyson, the materials team<br />is running another...
1607023 1608566 - Mr Dyson.<br />- Yes?
1608774 1611610 The materials team is running<br />another series this afternoon.
1611819 1614655 You have to sign for the...<br />Er... it.
1614864 1617783 - You have to sign it out.<br />- OK. Come on. I'll get it.
1619577 1620619 Mr Dyson,
1620828 1622848 I know I haven't been here long, but<br />I was wondering if you could tell me,
1622872 1625041 - I mean, if you know...<br />- Know what?
1625249 1627793 Well, if you know<br />where "it" came from.
1628002 1631297 I asked them that very same question<br />once. You know what they told me?
1631505 1632673 "Don't ask."
1639388 1641474 - Good morning, Mr Dyson.<br />- How's it going?
1642475 1643768 Insert key.
1643976 1646937 Left on three, two, one, turn.
1650858 1652618 - How are the wife and kids?<br />- Great. Thanks.
1652818 1653986 There you go.
1681806 1684266 So, what do you think, Doctor?
1685351 1687103 I have shown improvement, haven't I?
1688479 1691524 Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
1692441 1694068 I know how smart you are.
1694819 1696819 I think you're just telling me<br />what I want to hear.
1698030 1700616 I don't think you really believe<br />what you're telling me today.
1700908 1702618 I think if I put you<br />in minimum security,
1702827 1704829 you'll just try to escape again.
1709917 1712503 You have to let me see my son.
1713462 1714964 Please.
1716465 1717758 Please.
1719051 1722930 He's in great danger.<br />He's naked without me.
1723139 1724890 If I could just make a phone call...
1725099 1728018 Afraid not. Not for a while.
1729895 1732231 I don't see any choice<br />but to recommend to the review board
1732440 1734733 that you stay here<br />for another six months.
1738070 1739822 I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
1742408 1745661 - Get her off of me!<br />- You son of a bitch!
1745870 1748122 10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!
1749790 1752551 - You don't know what you're doing!<br />- Get some restraints in here now!
1755171 1757798 You don't know what you're doing!
1762219 1764263 Model citizen.
1803636 1806222 You just missed him.<br />He was here 15 minutes ago.
1806430 1808015 He said he was going to the galleria?
1808224 1809266 Yeah.
1809475 1811101 The galleria?
1857147 1859525 I'm gonna get some quarters.<br />I'll be back, all right?
1874582 1877209 - Oh, no!<br />- Girls, do you know John Connor?
1877418 1878919 No.
1881088 1884967 - Hey, do you know this guy?<br />- Nah, I don't know him.
1891557 1893142 - John.<br />- Not now.
1893350 1896186 Hey, there's this cop<br />scoping for you. Check it out.
1899648 1901567 - He's right over there.<br />- Split, man.
1901775 1903694 - Just go.<br />- Yeah.
1908949 1909950 I saw that kid...
1910159 1911285 Hey!
1925633 1927343 Hey! You're not supposed<br />to be in here!
1945527 1947071 Hey!
1953202 1954244 Get down.
2025399 2027192 Mister, are you all right?
2045043 2046086 Come on!
2086335 2087669 Goddamn!
2290205 2291623 Agh!
2366823 2369201 OK. Time out. Stop the bike.
2369409 2371328 Time out. Come on, stop the bike.
2385175 2387761 Holy shit.<br />Now, don't take this the wrong way.
2387969 2390013 - But you are a Terminator, right?<br />- Yes.
2390222 2394059 - Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.<br />- No?
2404778 2408865 Holy shit! You're really real.
2411284 2412744 I mean...
2415413 2419793 You're like a machine underneath,<br />right? But sort of alive outside?
2420001 2421795 I'm a cybernetic organism:
2422003 2424548 living tissue<br />over metal endoskeleton.
2439437 2441481 This is intense.
2441690 2444401 Get a grip, John. OK.
2447070 2449072 You're not here to kill me.
2449281 2453201 I figured that part out for myself.<br />So what's the deal?
2453410 2455996 My mission is to protect you.
2456204 2458707 Yeah? Who sent you?
2460000 2461001 You did.
2461209 2462544 35 years from now,
2462752 2466131 you reprogrammed me to be<br />your protector here, in this time.
2466339 2469092 Oh, this is deep.
2491698 2494534 This other guy,<br />he's a terminator like you, right?
2494743 2498204 Not like me.<br />A T-1000, advanced prototype.
2499915 2504336 - More advanced than you are?<br />- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
2505253 2507672 - What the hell does that mean?<br />- Liquid metal.
2509424 2510550 Where are we going?
2510759 2512510 We have to get out of the city<br />immediately
2512719 2513970 and avoid the authorities.
2514763 2517432 Listen, I got to stop by my house.<br />I want to pick up some stuff.
2517641 2521603 Negative. The T-1000 would definitely<br />try to reacquire you there.
2521811 2524481 - You sure?<br />- I would.
2535241 2537827 Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...
2540163 2541498 ...but I gotta warn them.
2541706 2544042 Shit! You got a quarter?
2552884 2555762 - Hello.<br />- 'Janelle, it's me.'
2555971 2558181 - John?<br />- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'
2558390 2560684 - Are you guys OK?<br />- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'
2560892 2563895 - Are you all right?<br />- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'
2564104 2567565 John, it's late.<br />I was beginning to worry about you.
2567774 2570318 If you hurry home, we can sit down<br />and have dinner together.
2570527 2571945 I'm making beef stew.
2572153 2574239 Something's wrong.<br />She's never this nice.
2574447 2576825 John, where are you?
2577033 2579786 What the hell is the goddamn dog<br />barking at?
2579995 2583123 Hey, shut up,<br />you worthless piece of shit!
2583331 2584666 The dog's really barking.
2584874 2587234 You were gonna tell the kid<br />to get rid of that fucking mutt.
2591006 2593633 John, honey, it's late.<br />Please don't make me worry.
2593842 2597846 - Could he already be there?<br />- Honey, are you OK?
2598054 2600223 I'm right here. I'm fine.
2600432 2601933 'Are you sure you're all right?'
2602142 2604936 - What's the dog's name?<br />- Max.
2605562 2607772 Janelle, what's wrong<br />with Wolfie?
2607981 2610442 I can hear him barking. Is he OK?
2610650 2613319 Wolfie's fine, honey.<br />Wolfie's just fine.
2614654 2616156 Where are you?
2617949 2619826 Your foster parents are dead.
2656821 2658823 No, no. I need a minute here.
2659032 2663203 You're telling me that this thing<br />can imitate anything it touches?
2663411 2665747 Anything it samples<br />by physical contact.
2665955 2667749 Get real.
2667957 2671586 It could disguise itself<br />as a pack of cigarettes?
2671795 2673463 No, only an object of equal size.
2673671 2676091 Why not just become a bomb<br />or something to get me?
2676674 2680011 It can't form complex machines.<br />Guns, explosives have chemicals,
2680220 2682347 moving parts.<br />It doesn't work that way.
2682639 2685016 - But it can form solid metal shapes.<br />- Like what?
2685642 2687227 Knives and stabbing weapons.
2718174 2720301 These were taken<br />by a video surveillance camera
2720635 2723555 at the West Highland police station<br />in 1984.
2725431 2728351 He killed<br />17 police officers that night.
2729978 2732105 Men with families...
2733481 2735066 ...children.
2736568 2740905 These were taken at a mall<br />in Reseda today.
2742282 2746202 Miss Connor,<br />we know you know who this guy is.
2748371 2752667 Look, I just sat here and told you<br />that your son is missing.
2752876 2754752 That the foster parents<br />have been murdered.
2754961 2757213 We know this guy's involved.
2758423 2762260 Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br />Don't you care?
2766639 2772770 - We're wasting our time. Let's go.<br />- Sorry, guys.
2772979 2775481 She's grown more and more<br />disconnected from reality
2775690 2777192 as time goes on.
2777400 2779068 I'm afraid she can't help us now.
2779277 2782947 If she clears at all and can<br />give us anything, I'll call you.
2783156 2784490 Sure.
2784699 2787452 Douglas,<br />take her back to her room, please.
2787660 2788745 Yes, sir.
2790413 2792457 Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
2792665 2797629 You see, we spent a lot of time<br />in Nicaragua and places like that.
2799756 2803384 For a while there, she was with<br />this crazy ex-Green Beret guy
2803676 2804802 running guns.
2805011 2807847 Then there were some other guys.
2808056 2809936 She'd shack up with anybody<br />she could learn from
2810016 2813228 so she could teach me how to be<br />this great military leader.
2815104 2817023 Then she gets busted.
2817232 2820735 It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's<br />a psycho. Didn't you know?"
2823071 2825071 It's like everything<br />I'd been brought up to believe
2825198 2826950 was all made-up bullshit.
2827158 2829577 I hated her for that.
2832914 2835541 But everything she said was true.
2836918 2838795 She knew.
2841047 2843049 And nobody believed her.
2844884 2846719 Not even me.
2848763 2850515 Listen,<br />we gotta get her out of there.
2850723 2854060 Negative. The T-1000's<br />highest probability for success now
2854269 2855478 will be to copy Sarah Connor
2855687 2857327 and wait for you<br />to make contact with her.
2857397 2859357 Great. What happens to her?
2859565 2862318 Typically, the subject<br />being copied is terminated.
2862527 2865488 Shit! Why didn't you tell me?<br />We gotta go right now!
2865697 2867824 Negative.<br />It's not a mission priority.
2868032 2870034 Fuck you! She's a priority to me!
2871911 2874747 Goddamn it!<br />What's your problem? Damn it!
2874956 2877792 - Help! Help!<br />- This does not help our mission.
2878001 2880336 Get this psycho off of me! Help!
2880545 2883464 Help! I'm being kidnapped!<br />Get this psycho off of me!
2883673 2884673 Let me go!
2889262 2892890 - Why the hell did you do that?<br />- Because you told me to.
2895727 2897395 What?
2902233 2904193 You have to do what I say, huh?
2904402 2906487 That's one of my mission parameters.
2907780 2911284 Prove it. Stand on one foot.
2913494 2914829 Yes!
2917040 2920626 Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
2922128 2924839 - You OK, kid?<br />- Take a hike, bozo.
2925048 2929469 - Let's get outta here, man.<br />- Fuck you, you little dipshit!
2930303 2931888 Dipshit?
2933931 2935933 Put your leg down.
2936142 2940813 - Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?<br />- Just trying to help this punk.
2941022 2943274 Grab this guy.<br />I can't believe he called me...
2943483 2946110 Agh! God! Get him off of me!
2946319 2949364 Now who's the dipshit,<br />you jock douche bag?
2949572 2950782 Get off me!
2956996 2958122 No!
2959374 2961667 Put the gun down, now!
2961876 2965046 - Get outta here!<br />- Come on. Let's split!
2972053 2973888 Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!
2974097 2976099 Of course. I'm a Terminator.
2978434 2980978 Listen to me very carefully, OK?
2981187 2984399 You're not a Terminator anymore,<br />all right?
2984607 2986692 You got that?
2986901 2989237 You just can't go around<br />killing people.
2989445 2990445 Why?
2991280 2993449 What do you mean, why?<br />Cos you can't.
2993658 2994658 Why?
2994700 2997370 Because you just can't.<br />Trust me on this.
3003418 3006879 Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.
3007088 3010508 And I order you to help me.
3076699 3078451 Hm!
3156237 3157280 Hi!
3157488 3161534 - You have a Sarah Connor here?<br />- You're running late, aren't you?
3161742 3163995 They've been in there for an hour.
3164203 3166539 Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.
3168416 3171043 Oh, here come your friends now.
3190730 3192648 Well, that was productive.
3234106 3237109 - Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?<br />- No, thanks.
3237860 3238861 How 'bout a beer?
3239070 3240488 Yeah, right!
3264553 3268015 - Hey, I got a full house.<br />- That's good, Lewis.
3268224 3270142 Must be my lucky day.
3412827 3415204 I think you're right<br />about number 24.
3415412 3418123 Increase the medication<br />to 250 milligrams.
3418332 3420543 - Same time?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3434557 3436725 You!
3441063 3442857 You broke my arm.
3443065 3445651 There are 215 bones<br />in the human body.
3445860 3448404 That's one. Now, don't move.
3454410 3456078 What are you gonna do?
3459707 3461750 Why do we stop now?
3463085 3466797 You gotta promise me<br />you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
3467006 3469466 - Right.<br />- Swear?
3469675 3471051 What?
3471260 3474263 Just put up your hand and say,<br />"I swear I won't kill anyone."
3475431 3479310 - I swear I will not kill anyone.<br />- All right. Let's go.
3486483 3490237 Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,<br />Monday through Friday.
3494533 3498287 - What the hell are you doing?<br />- You son of a bitch! You shot me!
3499955 3501415 You crazy bastard!
3505836 3507963 Don't shoot me again.<br />Don't kill me.
3511759 3513260 He'll live.
3528108 3530110 Son of a bitch!
3531236 3532905 Let's try to remain calm.
3533113 3535091 Open it, or he'll be dead<br />before he hits the floor.
3535115 3537034 There's no way, Connor. Let him go.
3537242 3539370 - Open the door.<br />- It ain't gonna happen.
3539578 3541413 Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.
3541622 3543248 It won't work, Sarah.<br />You're no killer.
3543457 3544792 I don't believe you can do it.
3545000 3546251 You're already dead, Silberman.
3546460 3547940 Everybody dies.<br />You know I believe it.
3548087 3551715 - So don't fuck with me!<br />- Open the door. Open the door.
3558013 3560224 Back off!
3560432 3561725 Get back!
3561934 3563727 I'll pump him full of this shit.<br />I swear!
3565604 3567147 Don't move!
3568482 3571443 - Drop the shit!<br />- Do it! Do it!
3572027 3574321 Get in the office.<br />On the floor, face down.
3574530 3575614 Not you!
3575823 3577324 Open the door.
3580327 3582579 On the floor. Hold it open.<br />Face the wall!
3599805 3601306 Get her! Get her!
3627541 3629084 Sarah!
3629293 3632129 - Hurry up! Open the door!<br />- The door's locked!
3633130 3635090 Let's go! Open it!
3635299 3636299 Get the other door!
3637718 3639553 - She broke it off.<br />- Open it!
3645100 3647269 Let's go around! Come on!<br />Move it!
3672669 3673962 No!
3674171 3675506 No!
3677591 3680552 - No!<br />- Mom, wait!
3680761 3682054 Mom!
3687684 3691230 - Come back here!<br />- No! No!
3691855 3692940 No!
3693148 3694650 - Help her!<br />- Wait here.
3694858 3696360 Hurry up!
3696568 3698529 He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!
3698737 3699822 Hold her.
3701532 3703075 He'll kill us all!
3724721 3726974 Mom, are you OK? Mom!
3731687 3733981 Come with me, if you want to live.
3734189 3736400 It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.<br />It's OK.
3761216 3762342 Go.
3794833 3797211 What the fuck is it?<br />What the fuck is going on?
3812142 3813477 Get down.
3830077 3831787 No! Mom!
3849930 3851306 Out of the car!
3852849 3853892 Right now!
3878709 3880377 Go!
3890804 3891847 I'm out.
3898812 3900564 - Come on.<br />- Here.
3903275 3905193 Reload.
3914286 3916121 Last one!
3923253 3924880 Hang on.
3951239 3952491 Ready!
3958080 3959414 John!
3966505 3968131 Here, drive.
4021810 4023812 He's not back there.<br />There's nobody behind us.
4024020 4026189 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah.
4028442 4031736 - Can you even see anything?<br />- I see everything.
4034906 4036366 Cool.
4040120 4041663 Come here.
4047794 4049421 I said I was OK.
4050380 4053341 John,<br />it was stupid of you to go there.
4054468 4056595 God damnit! You have to be<br />smarter than that.
4056803 4058263 You almost got yourself killed.
4059639 4061224 What were you thinking?
4062267 4064769 You cannot risk yourself,<br />even for me.
4064978 4066313 Do you understand?
4066521 4070692 You're too important.<br />Do you understand?
4073695 4074696 But...
4076531 4080118 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
4081495 4083705 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
4091046 4092547 What's wrong with your eyes?
4094716 4096051 Nothing.
4106061 4108355 So, what's your story?
4118949 4119991 You OK?
4120200 4121618 Fine.
4123537 4126623 Say, that's a nice bike.
4148645 4150772 Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.
4158613 4161575 Listen,<br />do you know what you're doing?
4161783 4164619 I have detailed files<br />on human anatomy.
4165579 4170542 I bet! Makes you<br />a more efficient killer, right?
4170750 4171793 Correct.
4178508 4179801 Does it hurt when you get shot?
4181845 4184681 I sense injuries. The data<br />could be called pain.
4187225 4188977 John, help me with the light.
4189227 4191187 - Will these heal up?<br />- Yes.
4191563 4194858 Good. If you can't pass for human,<br />you're not much good to us.
4195817 4198570 How long do you live,<br />I mean "last", whatever?
4199237 4201489 120 years with<br />my existing power cell.
4201990 4204451 Can you learn stuff you<br />haven't been programmed with?
4204826 4209622 So you can be...<br />you know, more human?
4210582 4212042 Not such a dork all the time?
4216379 4219382 My CPU is a neural-net processor,<br />a learning computer,
4219632 4222635 hat Skynet presets to READ<br />only when we are sent out alone.
4225555 4227432 Doesn't want you<br />to do too much thinking.
4227974 4229017 No.
4230810 4232520 Can we reset the switch?
4250997 4254584 Rotate the two locking cylinders<br />counterclockwise.
4261091 4262091 Do it.
4270892 4272394 Now open the port cover.
4275814 4277857 Pull to break the seal.
4281861 4285365 Good, now remove<br />the shock damping assembly.
4289077 4291204 You can now access the CPU.
4292622 4294082 - Do you see it?<br />- Yes.
4294958 4296835 Pull the CPU by its base tap.
4298795 4299795 Pull.
4337750 4338835 Can you see the pin switch?
4339419 4340670 No!
4342422 4344340 - Out of my way, John!<br />- Don't kill him!
4345717 4348136 "It", John, not "him".
4348386 4351306 Okay, "it". But we need "it".
4352140 4353725 Listen to me. Listen.
4354767 4356269 We're better off on our own.
4356853 4360023 He's the only proof of<br />the future, the war and that.
4361483 4362567 Maybe.
4365403 4366779 I don't trust it.
4367697 4368948 But he's my friend, alright?
4370074 4372410 You don't know what it's like<br />to kill these things.
4372952 4375747 If something goes wrong,<br />this could be our last chance.
4375955 4378541 If I'm supposed to<br />be this military leader,
4378750 4381794 maybe you start listening<br />to my ideas once in a while.
4385507 4389135 'Cause if my own mother won't,<br />how do you expect anyone else to?
4404442 4407278 Alright, play it your way.
4414786 4416788 Was there a problem?
4416996 4418373 No problem.
4420083 4421292 None whatsoever.
4454951 4456452 Are we learning yet?
4469465 4472427 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
4476347 4478182 Just head south.
4486733 4488192 Keep it under 65.
4488401 4491029 - We don't wanna be pulled over.<br />- Affirmative.
4491863 4496743 No, no, no. You gotta listen<br />to the way people talk.
4496951 4500371 You don't say "affirmative"<br />or some shit like that.
4500580 4502749 You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>
4502957 4506753 And if someone comes up to you<br />with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"
4506961 4511090 And if you want to shine them on,<br />it's <i>"Hasta la vista,</i> baby."
4511966 4513718 <i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.
4514761 4516471 Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."
4516679 4519474 And if someone gets upset,<br />you say, "Chill out."
4519682 4524103 - Or you can do combinations.<br />- Chill out, dick-wad.
4525021 4526940 That's great. See? You're getting it.
4527148 4529067 <i>No problemo.</i>
4539410 4542622 - You got any cash?<br />- I got a couple of hundred bucks.
4542955 4544165 I'll give you half.
4545166 4546292 Mom!
4547752 4549045 Get some food.
4551714 4553508 No sense of humor.
4559514 4561182 And that's another thing:
4561516 4563017 lighten up a bit.
4564018 4568106 This severe routine is getting old.<br />You're acting like such a geek.
4568356 4569816 Smile once in a while.
4570066 4571401 Smile?
4571734 4574112 Yeah. You know, smile.
4574445 4575488 Watch.
4576989 4580284 Hi. Nice place you got here.<br />How's business?
4581202 4582662 Gimme a break.
4584080 4586666 Okay. Bad example.
4587542 4590503 See that guy over there?<br />That's a smile.
4610773 4611816 That's good.
4612066 4615194 You could practice<br />in front of a mirror or something.
4622660 4623911 Want some of my fries?
4634672 4635798 Do you need any help?
4636507 4637507 No.
4637675 4639385 - Got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4639594 4641053 - Got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4648436 4650104 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4652774 4654025 People, I mean.
4657028 4659030 It's in your nature<br />to destroy yourselves.
4660198 4662825 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4663034 4665912 Break it up<br />before I wring both of your necks.
4668039 4672376 I need to know how Skynet gets built,<br />who's responsible.
4672585 4676047 The man most directly responsible<br />is Miles Bennett Dyson.
4676964 4678090 Who is that?
4678299 4681427 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
4684722 4686349 Why him?
4686557 4688810 In a few months he creates<br />a revolutionary type
4689018 4690269 of microprocessor.
4691020 4694273 - Go on. Then what?<br />- In three years,
4694482 4696442 Cyberdyne will become the largest<br />supplier
4696651 4697902 of military computer systems.
4698903 4701697 All Stealth bombers are upgraded<br />with Cyberdyne computers,
4701906 4703241 becoming fully unmanned.
4703449 4706577 Afterwards, they fly<br />with a perfect operational record.
4706786 4709163 The Skynet Funding bill is passed.
4709372 4712667 The system goes on-line<br />on August 4 1997.
4712875 4715795 Human decisions are removed<br />from strategic defence.
4716003 4718714 Skynet begins to learn<br />at a geometric rate.
4718923 4723094 It becomes self-aware at 02:14am<br />Eastern time, August 29.
4724262 4726597 In a panic,<br />they try to pull the plug.
4727932 4730142 - Skynet fights back.<br />- Yes.
4730351 4732854 It launches its missiles<br />against the targets in Russia.
4733062 4736107 Why attack Russia?<br />Aren't they our friends now?
4736315 4738568 Because Skynet knows<br />that the Russian counterattack
4738776 4740570 will eliminate its enemies over here.
4740778 4742280 Jesus!
4745700 4747020 How much do you know about Dyson?
4749662 4751330 I have detailed files.
4752915 4754375 want to know everything.
4756002 4759380 What he looks like.<br />Where he lives. Everything.
4771267 4772518 Miles!
4794707 4797960 - You going to work all day?<br />- I'm sorry, baby.
4798419 4800171 This thing is kicking my ass.
4800630 4804383 It's Sunday. You promised to take<br />the kids to Raging Waters today.
4806302 4809513 I can't. I'm on a roll.
4823361 4826614 This is gonna blow 'em away.<br />It's a neural-net processor.
4826864 4828324 I know. You told me.
4828574 4831327 It thinks and learns like we do.
4831786 4834205 It's superconducting<br />at room temperature.
4834455 4838417 Other computers are just<br />pocket calculators by comparison.
4840711 4842380 Why is that so important?
4842630 4845091 I need to know,<br />'cause sometimes I feel like
4845549 4847677 I'm going crazy here.
4849220 4851138 Baby, I am this close.
4852181 4853224 Come here.
4855559 4859397 Imagine a jet airliner<br />with a pilot that never gets tired,
4859647 4862817 never makes mistakes,<br />never shows up with a hangover.
4865319 4867154 Meet the pilot.
4867738 4871909 Why did we get married?<br />Have children? You don't need us.
4872660 4875830 Your heart and your mind<br />are in here.
4876163 4878332 But it doesn't love you like we do.
4886757 4889176 I'm sorry. Really.
4889927 4893514 How about spending some time<br />with your other babies?
4896559 4898269 - Raging Waters?<br />- Yeah!
4928507 4930134 Wait in the car.
4948694 4950571 Enrique!
4950780 4953115 Are you here?
4968547 4970147 You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
4972301 4978098 And you... are always like a snake.
4980226 4982228 It's great to see you, Connor!
4982436 4983516 I told you I would be back.
4983687 4986398 I knew you would.<br />It's good to see you.
4986607 4987607 Jolanda!
4987650 4990861 Get out here, we got company.<br />And bring some tequila.
4991070 4994198 - Hey, big John. <i>¿Cómo te va?</i><br />- What's up?
4994406 4996116 Who's this big guy?
4996325 5001288 He's cool, Enrique.<br />He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.
5001497 5003332 Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
5003541 5005960 Uncle Bob, huh?
5006544 5009046 OK. OK!
5010422 5011691 How are you?
5011715 5015010 How are you?<br />You've grown so much.
5015219 5016720 Drink?
5021016 5022268 Uncle Bob?
5023352 5027356 Hey, Sarita! You're pretty<br />famous, all over the goddamn TV.
5027565 5030109 Pictures of you, John,<br />your big friend here.
5030317 5033028 Cops are going nuts<br />looking for you.
5035948 5037074 I just came for my stuff.
5037283 5039743 I need clothes,<br />food and one of your trucks.
5039952 5041912 How about the fillings<br />out of my fucking teeth?
5042121 5044623 Now, Enrique!
5045666 5049461 - You two, you're on weapons detail.<br />- Come on. Let's go.
5070357 5072776 One thing about my mom...
5074612 5076739 ...she always plans ahead.
5087291 5088291 Excellent.
5099470 5103015 This is the best truck I got,<br />but the starter is gone.
5103223 5106060 - You got the time to change it out?<br />- Yeah.
5106268 5108187 I'm gonna wait till dark<br />to cross the border.
5108312 5111315 Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.
5111607 5114234 - You get out tonight too, okay?<br />- Sure.
5115736 5119114 Just drop by any time<br />and totally fuck up my life.
5124703 5127456 See, I grew up in places like this,
5127790 5130459 so I thought<br />that's how people lived:
5131126 5134380 riding around in helicopters,
5134922 5137007 learning how to blow shit up.
5138842 5143597 But then, when my mom got busted,<br />I got put in a regular school.
5144974 5147434 The other kids were into Nintendo.
5161949 5163742 Are you ever afraid?
5163993 5165285 No.
5169540 5170749 Not even of dying?
5171834 5172918 No.
5177923 5181844 You don't feel any emotion about it<br />one way or another?
5182094 5184722 No.<br />I have to stay functional
5184972 5187016 until the mission is complete.
5191603 5193564 Then it doesn't matter.
5194064 5197609 Yeah. I have to stay functional too.<br />I'm "too important".
5214376 5215836 That's definitely you.
5228098 5230225 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung round with were geeks.
5230434 5234104 but there was this one guy,<br />he was kinda cool.
5234313 5237483 - He taught me engines.<br />- Hold here.
5238442 5240861 Mom screwed it up, of course.
5241070 5243113 She'd always tell 'em about<br />Judgment Day
5243322 5245699 and me being this world leader.
5246492 5250496 - That'd be all she wrote.<br />- Torque wrench, please.
5252915 5253999 Here.
5255042 5259463 - I wish I could've met my real dad.<br />- You will.
5259671 5264259 Yeah, I guess.<br />When I'm, like, 45, I think.
5265552 5268722 I sent him back through time<br />to 1984.
5269556 5270808 Man!
5272518 5274812 He hasn't even been born yet.
5276563 5278524 It messes with your head.
5281151 5283779 - The other bolt.<br />- Oh. Here.
5290744 5294164 Mom and him were only together<br />for one night.
5294373 5299545 She still loves him, I guess.<br />I see her crying sometimes.
5299753 5301171 She denies it totally, of course,
5301380 5304174 like she got something<br />stuck in her eye.
5308428 5309930 Why do you cry?
5311056 5312850 - You mean people?<br />- Yeah.
5313058 5315519 I don't know. We just cry.
5316478 5318814 You know, when it hurts.
5325112 5330117 - Pain causes it?<br />- Er... no. It's different.
5330325 5333287 It's when there's nothing wrong<br />with you, but you hurt anyways.
5333495 5334913 - Get it?<br />- No.
5336290 5337875 All right, my man!
5338083 5341295 <i>- No problemo.</i><br />- Give me five.
5343839 5345757 Just put out your hand, like this.
5347134 5350846 All right! Now hit me.<br />Give me five. Do the same thing.
5351054 5353098 All right!
5356018 5358353 OK, that's good. Up high! High five!
5359479 5360606 Five low.
5360814 5362316 Too slow.
5365485 5367613 I'm just kidding. One more time.
5367821 5369907 Good. Now try it. Good!
5370115 5371867 Now do me. Give me five.
5373577 5375579 'Watching John with the machine,
5375787 5377956 it was suddenly so clear.
5378165 5381126 'The Terminator would never stop.
5381335 5385005 'It would never leave him<br />and it would never hurt him,
5385214 5388634 'never shout at him<br />or get drunk and hit him
5388842 5391136 'or say it was too busy<br />to spend time with him.
5392179 5396892 'It would always be there<br />and it would die to protect him.
5398644 5401647 'Of all the would-be fathers<br />who came and went over the years,
5401855 5406193 'this thing, this machine,<br />was the only one who measured up.
5407194 5411615 'In an insane world,<br />it was the sanest choice.'
5444648 5449486 Come here, darling.
5509254 5511465 Hey, let's try this one.
5516845 5518388 There we go.
5624619 5627038 She said you go south<br />with him like you planned.
5627247 5630250 - She'll meet you tomorrow.<br />- Mom!
5630459 5632210 Mom, wait!
5647684 5649394 "No fate".
5650729 5652939 "No fate, but what we make."
5655108 5656735 My father told her this.
5659738 5664326 I mean, I made him memorise it<br />in the future as a message to her.
5665577 5670749 Never mind.<br />Now, OK, the whole thing goes...
5670957 5673585 The future's not set.
5673793 5677214 There's no fate,<br />but what we make for ourselves.
5677422 5681927 - She intends to change the future.<br />- Yeah, I guess.
5683386 5685096 Oh, shit!
5685305 5687098 - Dyson.<br />- Yeah.
5687307 5690685 Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
5690894 5692771 She's gonna blow him away.
5692979 5694856 Come on! Let's go!
5695065 5696733 Let's go! Come on!
5707494 5710497 - This is tactically dangerous.<br />- Drive faster.
5710705 5714459 The T-1000 has the same files<br />that I do. It knows what I know.
5714668 5719172 - It might anticipate this move.<br />- I don't care. We gotta stop her.
5719381 5721758 Killing Dyson might prevent the war.
5721967 5723677 I don't care!
5723885 5725679 Haven't you learned anything yet?
5725887 5728056 Haven't you figured out<br />why you can't kill people?
5730934 5733770 Look, maybe you don't care<br />if you live or die.
5734020 5737065 But everybody's not like that!<br />We have feelings.
5737274 5739192 We hurt. We're afraid.
5741778 5746032 You gotta learn this stuff.<br />I'm not kidding. It's important.
5782527 5786323 Danny, I told you<br />to go to bed. I'm not kidding.
5786531 5788533 Just a couple of minutes, Mom!
5805884 5808053 Danny, your time is up.
5808219 5810930 Come brush your teeth<br />and get to bed.
5839584 5840794 Danny!
5842253 5843880 Ugh!
5852555 5856309 - Daddy!<br />- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!
5858019 5859062 Miles?
5862816 5864234 Miles!
5864442 5866736 - Tarissa, run!<br />- Oh, my God!
5873952 5875870 Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!
5876079 5877205 Run!
5877414 5879040 Oh, Jesus! Miles!
5898393 5900478 - Daddy!<br />- Danny! Danny!
5900687 5904190 - Nobody fucking move!<br />- Don't hurt my daddy!
5904399 5908069 Get down on the floor, bitch.<br />Get down now!
5908278 5910029 Get out of the way.
5910238 5911823 Don't hurt him!
5913533 5915076 Get on the floor now!
5917370 5919831 Just let the boy go.
5920039 5922876 Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
5923084 5925545 It's all your fault, motherfucker.
5925754 5927881 - It's all your fault!<br />- What?
5928089 5930091 I'm not gonna let you do it.
5948735 5949861 Shhh!
5954115 5955325 Shhh.
5982185 5984562 Shit! We're too late!
5988775 5989776 Check them.
5993488 5996991 Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?
5997951 5999494 Look at me.
6001496 6003456 I almost...
6003665 6005583 I almost...
6015385 6019430 It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.<br />We'll figure something out. OK?
6021391 6022725 I promise.
6026604 6031776 - You came here to stop me.<br />- Yeah, I did.
6034863 6036656 I love you, John.
6038575 6040660 I always have.
6042120 6043955 I know.
6050420 6052463 Deep penetration.
6054215 6056009 No shattered bone.
6056217 6059012 You hold here. The pressure<br />should stop the bleeding.
6069939 6073109 - Who are you people?<br />- Show him.
6076404 6080450 Danny, I want you to come with me<br />right now. Show me your room.
6093504 6096633 Oh, God! No!
6109103 6111397 Oh, my God!
6120657 6122158 Oh, my God.
6122367 6124827 Now, listen to me very carefully.
6127246 6130625 Nuclear winter effects<br />caused massive cooling...
6130833 6134879 'Dyson listened while<br />the Terminator laid it all down.
6135088 6138675 'Skynet. Judgment Day.
6138883 6141928 'The history of things to come.
6142887 6144597 'It's not every day that you find out
6144806 6148184 you're responsible<br />for three billion deaths.
6148393 6150979 'He took it pretty well.'
6152397 6154983 I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
6161489 6166077 You're judging me<br />on things I haven't even done yet.
6169831 6172458 How were we supposed to know?
6174544 6176170 Yeah!
6176379 6177880 Right.
6178798 6181884 How were you supposed to know?
6182093 6185680 Fucking men like you<br />built the hydrogen bomb.
6185888 6190101 Men like you thought it up.
6193896 6196941 You think you're so creative.
6197150 6200194 You don't know what it's like<br />to really create something,
6200403 6203990 to create a life,<br />to feel it growing inside you.
6204198 6206451 All you know how to create<br />is death and destruction.
6206659 6208036 Mom!
6208995 6212623 We need to be a little more<br />constructive here. OK?
6212832 6214872 We still have to stop this<br />from happening, don't we?
6215001 6216711 But I thought...
6217920 6221758 Aren't we changing things right now,<br />changing the way it goes?
6221966 6225511 That's right. There's no way<br />I'm gonna finish the new processor.
6225720 6228389 Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.
6228598 6232185 - I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.<br />- That's not good enough.
6232393 6235396 - No one must follow your work.<br />- Right.
6236481 6240318 All right, then we have to destroy<br />all the stuff at the lab:
6240526 6244947 the files, the disk drives,<br />everything, everything here.
6245782 6248618 Everything. I don't care.
6250620 6251620 The chip.
6252038 6253678 - Do you know about the chip?<br />- What chip?
6253790 6255291 They keep it in a vault<br />at Cyberdyne.
6255500 6256935 It must be from<br />the other one like you.
6256959 6261339 - The CPU from the first Terminator.<br />- Son of a bitch! I knew it!
6261547 6264133 They told us<br />not to ask where they got it.
6264342 6266552 Those lying motherfuckers.
6266761 6268429 It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.
6268638 6270765 I mean,<br />it was smashed, it didn't work,
6270973 6272350 but it gave us ideas,
6272558 6275436 took us in new directions,<br />things we would've never th...
6277688 6279690 All my work was based on it.
6279899 6281567 It must be destroyed.
6283903 6286864 Can you get us in? Past security?
6287073 6289992 I think so, yeah. When?
6294038 6295038 Now?
6299252 6301921 'The future,<br />always so clear to me,
6302130 6305049 'had become<br />like a black highway at night.
6305258 6310805 'We were in uncharted territory now,<br />making up history as we went along.'
6346257 6350761 Hi. Er... Carl, right?
6352513 6354353 Friends from out of town.<br />I just thought I'd...
6354765 6355765 Hi!
6356017 6357894 ...take 'em upstairs<br />and show 'em around.
6358102 6361272 Mr Dyson, you know the rules<br />concerning visitors in the lab.
6361480 6363482 I need written authorisation...
6364692 6368404 - I insist.<br />- Don't even think about it.
6379373 6380917 Come on. It's OK.
6382335 6383775 It takes two keys to open the vault.
6383920 6385504 They have<br />to be turned simultaneously.
6385713 6388382 The other one is in a locker<br />at the security station.
6390009 6391260 Gibbons?
6394513 6399185 Gibbons! Come on, man!<br />You can't leave the desk like that!
6401479 6402730 Gibbons!
6404232 6405524 Oh, shit.
6423501 6425544 My card should access this.
6429257 6431384 - What? What is it?<br />- Damn it.
6432635 6434428 The silent alarm's been tripped.
6440559 6443354 It's neutralised all the codes<br />in the entire building.
6443562 6447149 Nothing will open anywhere now.<br />We have to abort.
6448401 6449819 No.
6451529 6454699 We go all the way. OK?
6456993 6460663 You guys get started on the lab.<br />I can open this.
6460871 6462311 I think it's that guy from the mall.
6462498 6463498 It is!
6463624 6465793 It's him and the woman.
6467128 6469964 Look, just send everything<br />you got in the area right now.
6472550 6475803 I have a personal entry code<br />for the lab. It may still work.
6480474 6482643 - It's no good.<br />- Let me try mine.
6487898 6489859 John, fire in the hold!
6502038 6506709 Wait! You can't go in there.<br />The fire set off the halon system.
6514008 6516344 You have<br />to wait until the gas clears.
6518971 6520097 Put this on.
6534362 6536614 All right, let's get to work.
6558552 6561472 All units in the vicinity,<br />all units able to respond:
6561680 6566185 A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer<br />Street, the Cyberdyne building.
6566519 6568437 Suspect 1 is white, female,

6571857 6574485 escaped from<br />Pescadero State Hospital.
6574985 6576278 Suspect 2: white, male...
6580574 6584620 All the disks in my office. All the<br />disks in that office over there.
6584870 6586831 Everything behind my desk.
6587081 6589083 All the processors on my left.
6589333 6591585 We'll blow it up with the CP4.
6605391 6606767 Could I...
6607268 6608811 Excuse me...
6611021 6613149 Could I borrow that thing?
6622491 6624910 I worked a lot<br />of years on this thing.
6628956 6633210 - Give me that location again.<br />- 2111, Kramer.
6633461 6637089 The suspects are armed and<br />considered extremely dangerous.
6688307 6689975 All right!
6690184 6691810 7-2-5-6.
6693395 6694395 Yes!
6699109 6700402 Easy money.
6705199 6706533 Uh-oh.
6709245 6711538 Oh, shit! Not good.
6711747 6712915 Not good!
6716752 6720005 - How we doing?<br />- Primer cord is set.
6720214 6722466 One more barrel, two more minutes.
6724510 6729348 - How do we set them off?<br />- Remote control.
6729556 6731809 Piece of cake.
6732017 6733435 - We got company.<br />- Police?
6733644 6736855 - How many?<br />- All of 'em, I think.
6737064 6738983 Go. I'll finish here.
6740442 6741735 Come on.
6742945 6746115 - I'll take care of the police.<br />- Wait! You swore!
6749243 6750494 Trust me.
6763924 6765801 'You at the window!
6766010 6768971 'Drop your weapon and place<br />your hands on top of your head!'
6770431 6773726 - Holy shit!<br />- That's a damn mini-gun!
6796206 6798375 - Come on!<br />- Oh, shit!
6798584 6799960 Go! Go! Go!
6847674 6849051 Fire!
6866360 6868112 We go same time, to the left.
6868320 6870906 One, two, three, go.
6882835 6885379 All right, in order to get that out,<br />you have to...
6893095 6896723 We got Skynet by the balls now,<br />don't we? Come on, let's book.
6898100 6899435 Hold your fire!
6925085 6927337 - Ready to rock?<br />- Ready.
6930841 6933469 Time to go. Now.
6933677 6936472 - Take this. They'll use gas.<br />- Come on.
6936680 6939641 Get started on the door.<br />Miles, hand me the detonator.
6964249 6966668 Mom! Mom!

7602846 7604597 He's gaining.
7606558 7609352 - Step on it!<br />- This is the vehicle's top speed.
7609561 7611604 I can run faster than this!
7621948 7623241 Coming up, to the right.
7625910 7627245 Watch it! Watch it!

8656315 8657983 I need a vacation.
8672497 8676168 - Is it dead?<br />- Terminated.
8679713 8681298 Will this melt in there?
8684551 8686136 Yes. Throw it in.
8691016 8692016 <i>Adiós!</i>

8719086 8720462 There's one more chip.
8725467 8727427 And it must be destroyed also.
8733100 8734476 Here.
8734685 8738689 I cannot self-terminate.<br />You must lower me into the steel.
8744319 8745862 No.

8751326 8753704 - I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.<br />- No!
8753912 8755914 No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.
8756123 8758000 - It'll be OK.<br />- I have to go away.
8758208 8760669 No, don't do it. Please, don't go.
8760877 8763630 - I must go away, John.<br />- No!
8764297 8765382 No, wait.
8765590 8768343 - You don't have to do this.<br />- I'm sorry.
8769511 8771555 No, don't do it! Don't go!
8772014 8773557 It has to end here.
8774891 8778061 I order you not to go!<br />I order you not to go!
