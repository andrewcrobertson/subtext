120962 123750 <i>They lived only to face a new nightmare:</i>
123965 125922 <i>the war against the machines.</i>
204254 207873 <i>The computer which<br />controlled the machines, Skynet,</i>
208091 211050 <i>sent two Terminators back through time.</i>
211261 214880 <i>Their mission, to destroy the<br />leader of the human resistance,</i>
215098 217715 <i>John Connor, my son.</i>
222022 226016 <i>The first Terminator was programmed<br />to strike at me in the year 1984,</i>

228987 230478 <i>It failed.</i>
230697 235237 <i>The second was set to strike at<br />John himself when he was still a child.</i>
239539 243579 <i>As before, the resistance<br />was able to send a lone warrior,</i>

731698 733109 Ugh!
790048 791414 -John!
791632 794232 John, get in there and<br />clean up that pigsty of yours.
799557 801719 -John!
806314 808464 Your foster parents<br />are kind of dicks, huh?
809150 811767 I swear, I have had it<br />with that goddamn kid.
811986 814586 -He won't even answer me anymore.<br />-Honey, move.
814697 817485 Would you get off your butt and help me?
817700 820408 -Todd!<br />-What?
820620 823863 He hasn't cleaned that<br />room of his in a month.
824082 826995 Well, it's an emergency.<br />Hang on. I'll get right on it.
834801 836542 -Come on!<br />-John!
836761 839879 C'mon! Get your ass inside.<br />Do what your mother tells you.
841140 843723 She's not my mother, Todd.
870503 872087 This next patient is interesting.
872171 874629 I've been following the case for years.
874841 876833 A 29-year-old female…
879262 881800 Diagnosed as acute<br />schizo-affective disorder.
882014 884114 The usual indicators:<br />depression, anxiety,
884267 886805 violent acting out,<br />delusions of persecution.
893484 896602 The delusional<br />architecture is fairly unique.
896821 899655 She believes that a machine<br />called the Terminator,
899866 903867 which looked human, of course,<br />was sent back through time to kill her.
904078 905194 That's original.
905413 908121 And also, that the father of her child
908332 911166 was a soldier sent back to protect her.
911377 913664 -No?<br />-He was from the future too.
913880 918671 The year 2029, if I remember correctly.
918885 920751 And here we are.
921596 922632 Morning, Sarah.
927101 930936 Good morning, Dr<br />Silberman. How's the knee?
932857 934723 Fine, Sarah.
935943 941109 She, uh... stabbed me in the<br />kneecap with my pen a few weeks ago.
941949 943299 Repeated escape attempts...
953628 955711 Let's move on, shall we?
955922 959547 Lewis, I don't like to see the<br />patients disrupting their rooms like this.
959759 962843 -See she takes her Thorazine.<br />-Sure. I'll take care of it.
986410 988510 Are you the legal<br />guardian of John Connor?
989163 991530 That's right, Officer.<br />What's he done now?
992375 995210 -Could I speak with him, please?<br />-You could if he were here.
995294 998130 He took off on his bike this<br />morning so he could be anywhere.
998214 1001707 -Do you have a photograph of John?<br />-Yeah. Hold on.
1004679 1007012 You gonna tell me what this is about?
1007223 1009173 I just need to ask him a few questions.
1011561 1014554 He's a good-looking boy. Do<br />you mind if I keep this picture?
1014772 1018022 No, go on. There was a guy here<br />this morning looking for him, too.
1018234 1019941 Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
1020152 1022102 Has that got something to do with this?
1024490 1028325 No. I wouldn't worry about him.
1029662 1032245 Thanks for your cooperation.
1033499 1035991 Please insert your stolen card now.

1051392 1052724 All right!
1052935 1056428 -PIN number 9003.<br />-Where'd you learn this stuff from?

1063571 1066279 Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!
1066490 1068573 -Yes!<br />-Hey, it worked.
1068784 1072323 All right. Easy money. Come on!
1074957 1076949 Yes! Piece of cake.
1082548 1085336 -Is that her?<br />-Yes.
1085551 1089591 -She's pretty cool, huh?<br />-No, she's a complete psycho.
1089805 1093424 That's why she's at Pescadero.<br />It's a mental institute, okay?
1094310 1097810 She tried to blow up a computer<br />factory, but she got shot and arrested.
1097897 1099354 No shit.
1100191 1102478 She's a total loser.
1102693 1105276 Come on. Let's go spend some money.
1120836 1124375 It's like a giant strobe light
1124590 1126832 burning right through my eyes.
1131055 1133297 Somehow, I can still see.
1139355 1141142 Oh, God.
1144819 1147903 We know the dream's the same every night.
1148280 1151444 -Why do I have to...<br />-Please continue.
1155371 1157863 Children look like burnt paper.
1159625 1161082 Black.
1162044 1163660 Not moving.
1165589 1168423 And then the blast wave hits them.
1177393 1179806 And they fly apart like leaves.
1181772 1186938 Dreams of cataclysm, the end<br />of the world are very common.
1188946 1193031 It's not a<br />dream, you moron. It's real.
1193242 1196986 -I know the date it happens.<br />-I'm sure it feels very real to you.
1197204 1202290 On August 29, 1997, it's gonna<br />feel pretty fuckin' real to you, too!
1203586 1205953 Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock
1206172 1208664 is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?
1209175 1211883 God! You think you're safe and alive.
1212094 1214256 You're already dead. Everybody!
1214472 1216885 Him. You. You're dead already.
1217099 1219842 This whole place,<br />everything you see is gone!
1220060 1223019 You're the one living in a<br />fucking dream, Silberman!
1223230 1225813 'Cause I know it happened! It happened!
1237119 1239031 I feel much better now.
1240247 1241988 Clearer.
1242208 1247545 Yes, your attitude has<br />been much improved lately.
1256764 1259097 It's helped me to have a goal,
1259892 1262350 something to look forward to.
1262561 1263597 What is that?
1264480 1269942 Well, you said that if I showed<br />improvement after six months,
1270152 1272690 you would transfer me to<br />the minimum security wing
1272905 1275989 and I could have visitors.
1277284 1280573 Well, it's been six months and...
1282498 1284615 I was looking forward to seeing my son.
1285835 1287326 I see.
1290506 1295592 Let's go back to what you were<br />saying about those Terminator machines.
1295803 1299046 Now you think they don't exist?
1299265 1301473 They don't exist.
1301684 1303266 I know that now.
1303477 1305277 But you've told me on many occasions
1305479 1308813 about how you crushed<br />one in a hydraulic press.
1310192 1313185 If I had, there would<br />have been some evidence.
1313404 1315704 They would have found<br />something at the factory.
1315906 1317898 I see.
1318117 1321952 So, you don't believe any more<br />that the company covered it up?
1324123 1326581 No. Why would they?
1327501 1329743 Let's try a new position right there.
1329962 1334127 The neuronal sensors are<br />correct, because it works.
1334341 1336833 -Right.<br />-Those neurons are all centered.
1337720 1339712 Maybe the inhibitor circuits failed...
1339930 1341011 Mr. Dyson?
1341849 1344887 Mr. Dyson, the materials<br />team is running another...
1346061 1347597 -Mr. Dyson.<br />-Yes?
1347813 1350763 The materials team is running<br />another series this afternoon.
1350858 1353692 You have to sign for the... Uh... it.
1353903 1356816 -You have to sign it out.<br />-Okay. Come on. I'll get it.
1358616 1359652 Mr. Dyson,
1359867 1361827 I know I haven't been here long, but<br />I was wondering if you could tell me,
1361911 1364073 -I mean, if you know...<br />-Know what?
1364288 1366826 Well, if you know where "it" came from.
1367041 1370460 I asked them that very same question<br />once. You know what they told me?
1370544 1371705 "Don't ask."
1378427 1380510 -Good morning, Mr. Dyson.<br />-How's it going?
1381513 1382799 Insert key.
1383015 1385974 Left on three, two, one, turn.
1389897 1391773 -How are the wife and kids?<br />-Great. Thanks.
1391857 1393018 There you go.
1420844 1423302 So, what do you think, Doctor?
1424390 1426190 I have shown improvement, haven't I?
1427518 1430556 Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
1431480 1433096 I know how smart you are.
1433857 1436357 I think you're just telling<br />me what I want to hear.
1437069 1439863 I don't think you really believe<br />what you're telling me today.
1439947 1443857 I think if I put you in minimum<br />security, you'll just try to escape again.
1448956 1451539 You have to let me see my son.
1452501 1453992 Please.
1455504 1456790 Please.
1458090 1461959 He's in great danger.<br />He's naked without me.
1462177 1463977 If I could just make a phone call...
1464138 1467051 Afraid not. Not for a while.
1468934 1471394 I don't see any choice but to<br />recommend to the review board
1471478 1473765 that you stay here<br />for another six months.
1477109 1478850 I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
1481447 1484690 -Get her off of me!<br />-You son of a bitch!
1484908 1487150 10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!
1488829 1492179 -You don't know what you're doing!<br />-Get some restraints in here now!
1494209 1496826 You don't know what you're doing!
1501258 1503295 Model citizen.
1542674 1545324 You just missed him.<br />He was here 15 minutes ago.
1545469 1547178 He said he was going to the galleria?
1547262 1548298 Yeah.
1548514 1550130 The galleria?
1596186 1598786 I'm gonna get some<br />quarters. I'll be back, all right?
1613620 1616237 -Oh, no!<br />-Girls, do you know John Connor?
1616456 1617947 No.
1620127 1623996 -Hey, do you know this guy?<br />-Nah, I don't know him.
1630596 1632178 -John.<br />-Not now.
1632389 1635223 Hey, there's this cop<br />scoping for you. Check it out.
1638687 1640599 -He's right over there.<br />-Split, man.
1640814 1642726 -Just go.<br />-Yeah.
1647988 1650314 I saw that kid... Hey!
1664671 1666621 Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!
1684566 1686102 Hey!
1692241 1693277 Get down.
1764438 1766225 Mister, are you all right?
1784082 1785118 Come on!
1825374 1826706 Goddamn!
2029244 2030655 Agh!
2105862 2108229 Okay. Time out. Stop the bike.
2108448 2110360 Time out. Come on, stop the bike.
2124214 2126797 Holy shit. Now, don't<br />take this the wrong way.
2127008 2129045 -But you are a Terminator, right?<br />-Yes.
2129260 2133095 -Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.<br />-No?
2143817 2147902 Holy shit! You're really real.
2150323 2151780 I mean...
2154452 2158822 You're like a machine underneath,<br />right? But sort of alive outside?
2159040 2160827 I'm a cybernetic organism:
2161042 2163580 living tissue over metal endoskeleton.
2178476 2180513 This is intense.
2180729 2183437 Get a grip, John. Okay.
2186109 2188101 You're not here to kill me.
2188319 2192233 I figured that part out for<br />myself. So what's the deal?
2192449 2195032 My mission is to protect you.
2195243 2197735 Yeah? Who sent you?
2199038 2200028 You did.
2200248 2201580 Thirty-five years from now,
2201791 2205159 you reprogrammed me to be<br />your protector here, in this time.
2205378 2208121 Oh, this is deep.
2210216 2213254 So this other guy, he's a<br />Terminator like you, right?
2213470 2216929 Not like me. A T-1000,<br />advanced prototype.
2218641 2223056 -More advanced than you are?<br />-Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
2223980 2226393 -What the hell does that mean?<br />-Liquid metal.
2228151 2229267 Where are we going?
2229486 2232886 We have to get out of the city<br />immediately and avoid the authorities.
2233490 2236283 Listen, I got to stop by my<br />house. I want to pick up some stuff.
2236367 2240327 Negative. The T-1000 would<br />definitely try to reacquire you there.
2240538 2243201 -You sure?<br />-I would.
2253968 2256551 Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks…
2258890 2260222 But I gotta warn them.
2260433 2262766 Shit! You got a quarter?
2271611 2274479 -Hello.<br /><i>-Janelle, it's me.</i>
2274697 2276905 -John?<br /><i>-Yeah. Is everything all right?</i>
2277116 2279535 -Are you guys okay?<br /><i>-Sure, honey, everything's okay.</i>
2279619 2282612 -Are you all right?<br /><i>-Yeah, I'm fine.</i>
2282831 2286290 John, it's late. I was<br />beginning to worry about you.
2286501 2289170 If you hurry home, we can sit<br />down and have dinner together.
2289254 2290665 I'm making beef stew.
2290880 2292963 Something's wrong. She's never this nice.
2293174 2295541 -John, where are you?
2295760 2298503 What the hell is the<br />goddamn dog barking at?
2298721 2301839 Hey, shut up, you<br />worthless piece of shit!
2302058 2303390 The dog's really barking.
2303601 2306551 You were gonna tell the kid<br />to get rid of that fucking mutt.
2309732 2312232 John, honey, it's late.<br />Please don't make me worry.
2312369 2314385 Could he already be there?
2315495 2316514 Honey, are you okay?
2316598 2318943 I'm right here.<br />I'm fine.
2319158 2320758 <i>Are you sure you're all right?</i>
2320869 2323657 - What's the dog's name?<br />-Max.
2324289 2326624 Janelle,<br />what's wrong with Wolfie?
2326708 2329166 I can hear him barking. Is he okay?
2329377 2332040 Wolfie's fine, honey. Wolfie's just fine.
2333381 2334872 Where are you?
2336676 2338542 Your foster parents are dead.
2375548 2377540 No, no. I need a minute here.
2377759 2381924 You're telling me that this thing<br />can imitate anything it touches?
2382138 2384471 Anything it samples by physical contact.
2384682 2386469 Get real.
2386684 2390303 It could disguise itself<br />as a pack of cigarettes?
2390521 2392183 No, only an object of equal size.
2392398 2394848 Why not just become a<br />bomb or something to get me?
2395026 2397063 It can't form complex machines.
2397278 2399363 Guns and explosives have<br />chemicals, moving parts.
2399447 2400733 It doesn't work that way.
2400949 2403737 -But it can form solid metal shapes.<br />-Like what?
2403952 2405944 Knives and stabbing weapons.
2406871 2409331 These were taken<br />by a video surveillance camera
2409415 2412783 at the West Highland<br />Police Station in 1984.
2414295 2417208 He killed 17 police officers that night.
2418841 2420958 Men with families
2422345 2423927 children.
2425431 2429766 These were taken at<br />a mall in Reseda today.
2431145 2435059 Miss Connor,<br />we know you know who this guy is.
2437235 2441525 Look, I just sat here and told<br />you that your son is missing.
2441739 2443741 That the foster parents<br />have been murdered.
2443825 2446067 We know this guy's involved.
2447286 2451121 Doesn't that mean anything<br />to you? Don't you care?
2455503 2461625 -We're wasting our time. Let's go.<br />-Sorry, guys.
2461843 2466045 She's grown more and more<br />disconnected from reality as time goes on.
2466264 2467926 I'm afraid she can't help us now.
2468141 2471805 If she clears at all and can<br />give us anything, I'll call you.
2472020 2473352 Sure.
2473563 2476306 Douglas, take her back<br />to her room, please.
2476524 2477605 Yes, sir.
2479277 2481314 Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
2481529 2486490 You see, we spent a lot of time<br />in Nicaragua and places like that.
2488619 2492238 For a while there, she was with<br />this crazy ex-Green Beret guy
2492540 2493656 running guns.
2493875 2496709 Then there were some other guys.
2496919 2498796 She'd shack up with<br />anybody she could learn from
2498880 2502089 so she could teach me how<br />to be this great military leader.
2503968 2505880 Then she gets busted.
2506095 2509588 It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's<br />a psycho. Didn't you know?"
2511934 2515803 It's like everything I'd been brought<br />up to believe was all made-up bullshit.
2516022 2518435 I hated her for that.
2521778 2524395 But everything she said was true.
2525782 2527648 She knew.
2529911 2531903 And nobody believed her.
2533748 2535580 Not even me.
2537627 2539503 Listen, we gotta get her out of there.
2539587 2542921 Negative. The T-1000's highest<br />probability for success now
2543132 2546176 will be to copy Sarah Connor and<br />wait for you to make contact with her.
2546260 2548217 Great. What happens to her?
2548429 2551172 Typically, the subject<br />being copied is terminated.
2551390 2554349 Shit! Why didn't you tell<br />me? We gotta go right now!
2554560 2556677 Negative. It's not a mission priority.
2556896 2558888 Fuck you! She's a priority to me!
2560775 2563609 Goddamn it! What's your problem? Damn it!
2563820 2566654 -Help! Help!<br />-This does not help our mission.
2566864 2569197 Get this psycho off of me! Help!
2569408 2572321 Help! I'm being kidnapped!<br />Get this psycho off of me!
2572537 2573448 Let me go!
2578126 2581745 -Why the hell did you do that?<br />-Because you told me to.
2584590 2586252 What?
2591097 2593054 You have to do what I say, huh?
2593266 2595349 That's one of my mission parameters.
2596644 2600137 Prove it. Stand on one foot.
2602358 2603690 Yes!
2605903 2609487 Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
2610992 2613700 -You okay, kid?<br />-Take a hike, bozo.
2613911 2618326 -Let's get outta here, man.<br />-Fuck you, you little dipshit!
2619167 2620749 Dipshit?
2622795 2624787 Put your leg down.
2625006 2629671 -Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?<br />-Just trying to help this punk.
2629886 2632136 Grab this guy. I can't<br />believe he called me...
2632346 2634963 Agh! God! Get him off of me!
2635183 2638221 Now who's the dipshit,<br />you jock douche bag?
2638436 2639643 Get off me!
2645860 2646976 -No!
2648237 2650524 Put the gun down, now!
2650740 2653904 -Get outta here!<br />-Come on. Let's split!
2660917 2662749 Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!
2662960 2664952 Of course. I'm a Terminator.
2667298 2669836 Listen to me very carefully, okay?
2670051 2673260 You're not a Terminator<br />anymore, all right?
2673471 2675554 You got that?
2675765 2678098 You just can't go around killing people.
2678309 2679174 Why?
2680144 2682306 What do you mean, why? 'Cause you can't.
2682521 2683354 Why?
2683564 2686227 Because you just can't. Trust me on this.
2692281 2695740 Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.
2695952 2699366 And I order you to help me.
2765563 2767304 Hm!
2845101 2846137 Hi!
2846352 2850392 -You have a Sarah Connor here?<br />-You're running late, aren't you?
2850606 2852848 They've been in there for an hour.
2853067 2855400 Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.
2857279 2859896 Oh, here come your friends now.
2879593 2881505 Well, that was productive.
2922970 2925963 -Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?<br />-No, thanks.
2926724 2927714 How 'bout a beer?
2927933 2929344 Yeah, right!
2953417 2956876 -Hey, I got a full house.<br />-That's good, Lewis.
2957087 2958999 Must be my lucky day.
3101690 3104057 I think you're<br />right about number 24.
3104276 3106984 Increase the medication<br />to 250 milligrams.
3107196 3109404 -Same time?<br />-Mm-hmm.
3123420 3125582 You!
3129927 3131714 You broke my arm.
3131929 3134512 There are 215 bones in the human body.
3134723 3137261 That's one. Now, don't move.
3143273 3144935 What are you gonna do?
3148570 3150607 Why do we stop now?
3151949 3155659 You gotta promise me you're<br />not gonna kill anyone, right?
3155869 3158327 -Right.<br />-Swear?
3158539 3159905 What?
3160124 3163124 Just put up your hand and<br />say, "I swear I won't kill anyone."
3164294 3168163 -I swear I will not kill anyone.<br />-All right. Let's go.
3175347 3179091 Visiting hours is 10:00 to<br />4:00, Monday through Friday.
3183397 3187141 -What the hell are you doing?<br />-You son of a bitch! You shot me!
3188819 3190276 You crazy bastard!
3194000 3196817 Don't shoot me again. Don't kill me.
3200622 3202113 He'll live.
3216972 3218964 Son of a bitch!
3220100 3221762 Let's try to remain calm.
3221977 3223895 Open it, or he'll be dead<br />before he hits the floor.
3223979 3225891 There's no way, Connor. Let him go.
3226106 3228358 -Open the door.<br />-It ain't gonna happen.
3228442 3230274 Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.
3230486 3232237 It won't work, Sarah. You're no killer.
3232321 3233780 I don't believe you can do it.
3233864 3235240 You're already dead, Silberman.
3235324 3236866 Everybody dies. You know I believe it.
3236950 3240569 -So don't fuck with me!<br />-Open the door. Open the door.
3246877 3249085 Back off!
3249296 3250582 Get back!
3250798 3252848 I'll pump him full of this shit. I swear!
3254468 3256004 Don't move!
3257346 3260305 -Drop the shit!<br />-Do it! Do it!
3260891 3263178 Get in the office. On<br />the floor, face down.
3263393 3264474 Not you!
3264686 3266177 Open the door.
3269191 3271433 On the floor. Hold it<br />open. Face the wall!
3288669 3290160 Get her! Get her!
3316405 3317941 Sarah!
3318156 3320990 -Hurry up! Open the door!<br />-The door's locked!
3321994 3323951 Let's go! Open it!
3324162 3325112 Get the other door!
3326582 3328414 -She broke it off.<br />-Open it!
3333964 3336126 Let's go around! Come on! Move it!
3361533 3362819 No!
3363035 3364367 No!
3366455 3369414 -No!<br />-Mom, wait!
3369625 3370911 Mom!
3376548 3380087 -Come back here!<br />-No! No!
3380719 3381800 No!
3382012 3383503 -Help her!<br />-Wait here.
3383722 3385213 Hurry up!
3385432 3387389 He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!
3387601 3388682 Hold her.
3390395 3391931 He'll kill us all!
3413585 3415827 Mom, are you okay? Mom!
3420550 3422837 Come with me if you want to live.
3423053 3425303 It's okay, Mom. He's<br />here to help. It's okay.
3450080 3451196 Go.
3483697 3486064 What the fuck is it?<br />What the fuck is going on?
3501006 3502338 Get down.
3518940 3520647 No! Mom!
3538794 3540160 Out of the car!
3541713 3542749 Right now!
3567572 3569234 Go!
3579668 3580704 I'm out.
3587676 3589417 -Come on.<br />-Here.
3592139 3594051 Reload.
3603150 3604982 Last one!
3612117 3613733 Hang on.
3640103 3641344 Ready!
3646943 3648275 John!
3655368 3656984 Here, drive.
3710674 3712800 He's not back there.<br />There's nobody behind us.
3712884 3715046 -Are you all right?<br />-Yeah.
3717305 3720594 -Can you even see anything?<br />-I see everything.
3723770 3725227 Cool.
3728984 3730520 Come here.
3736658 3738274 I said I was okay.
3739244 3742203 John, it was stupid of you to go there.
3743331 3745581 God damnit! You have<br />to be smarter than that.
3745667 3747217 You almost got yourself killed.
3748503 3750085 What were you thinking?
3751131 3753623 You cannot risk yourself, even for me.
3753842 3755174 Do you understand?
3755385 3759550 You're too important. Do you understand?
3762559 3763549 But...
3765395 3768979 I had to get you out<br />of that place. I'm sorry.
3770358 3772858 I didn't need your help. I<br />can take care of myself.
3779909 3781400 What's wrong with your eyes?
3783580 3784912 Nothing.
3794924 3797211 So, what's your story?
3807812 3808848 You okay?
3809064 3810475 Fine.
3812400 3815484 Say, that's a nice bike.
3837509 3839626 Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.
3847477 3850436 Listen, do you know what you're doing?
3850647 3853481 I have detailed files on human anatomy.
3854442 3859403 I bet! Makes you a<br />more efficient killer, right?
3859614 3860650 Correct.
3866996 3868703 Does it hurt when you get shot?
3870041 3873125 I sense injuries. The<br />data could be called "pain".
3875839 3877626 John, help me with the light.
3877841 3879673 -Will these heal up?<br />-Yes.
3879884 3884299 Good. If you can't pass for a<br />human, you're not much good to us.
3884514 3887473 How long do you live?<br />I mean, last. Whatever.
3887684 3890347 120 years with my existing power cell.
3890562 3893412 Can you learn stuff that you<br />haven't been programmed with,
3893606 3895268 so you can be
3896359 3900854 you know, more human, and<br />not such a dork all the time?
3903366 3906950 My CPU is a neural net<br />processor, a learning computer.
3907162 3910872 The more contact I have<br />with humans, the more I learn.
3911082 3912698 Cool.
3944157 3945648 Are we learning yet?
3958671 3961630 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
3965553 3967385 Just head south.
3975939 3977396 Keep it under 65.
3977607 3980224 -We don't wanna be pulled over.<br />-Affirmative.
3981069 3985939 No, no, no. You gotta<br />listen to the way people talk.
3986157 3989571 You don't say "affirmative"<br />or some shit like that.
3989786 3991948 You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>
3992163 3995952 And if someone comes up to you<br />with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"
3996167 4000286 And if you want to shine them<br />on, it's "Hasta la vista, baby."
4001172 4002913 Hasta la vista, baby.
4003967 4005674 Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."
4005885 4008673 And if someone gets<br />upset, you say, "Chill out."
4008888 4013303 -Or you can do combinations.<br />-Chill out, dick-wad.
4014227 4016139 That's great. See? You're getting it.
4016354 4018266 <i>No problemo.</i>
4032996 4034783 Want some of my fries?
4045091 4048584 -Need any help?<br />-No.
4048803 4052171 -I got you!<br />-No, you didn't!
4052390 4054340 I did! I came round here and I got you!
4054434 4058098 No, you didn't!
4058980 4061097 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4063901 4065142 People, I mean.
4068156 4070256 It's in your nature to<br />destroy yourselves.
4071326 4073943 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4074162 4077030 Break it up before<br />I wring both of your necks.
4079167 4083502 I need to know how Skynet<br />gets built, who's responsible.
4083713 4087172 The man most directly<br />responsible is Miles Bennett Dyson.
4088092 4089208 Who is that?
4089427 4092927 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
4095850 4097466 Why him?
4097685 4101387 In a few months he creates a<br />revolutionary type of microprocessor.
4102148 4105391 -Go on. Then what?<br />-In three years,
4105610 4109160 Cyberdyne will become the largest<br />supplier of military computer systems.
4110031 4112881 All Stealth bombers are upgraded<br />with Cyberdyne computers,
4113034 4114366 becoming fully unmanned.
4114577 4117695 Afterwards, they fly with a<br />perfect operational record.
4117914 4120281 The Skynet Funding bill is passed.
4120500 4123789 The system goes<br />on-line on August 4, 1997.
4124003 4126916 Human decisions are<br />removed from strategic defense.
4127131 4129839 Skynet begins to learn<br />at a geometric rate.
4130051 4134216 It becomes self-aware at<br />02:14am Eastern time, August 29.
4135390 4137723 In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
4139060 4141268 -Skynet fights back.<br />-Yes.
4141479 4144106 It launches its missiles<br />against the targets in Russia.
4144190 4147228 Why attack Russia?<br />Aren't they our friends now?
4147443 4149820 Because Skynet knows that<br />the Russian counterattack
4149904 4151754 will eliminate its enemies over here.
4151906 4153397 Jesus!
4156828 4158478 How much do you know about Dyson?
4160248 4161989 I have detailed files.
4163376 4165117 I wanna know everything.
4166546 4170506 What he looks like,<br />where he lives, everything.
4199120 4200736 Wait in the car.
4219307 4221173 Enrique!
4221392 4223725 Are you here?
4239160 4241210 You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
4242914 4248706 And you... are always like a snake.
4250838 4252938 It's great<br />to see you, Connor!
4253049 4254216 I told you I would be back.
4254300 4257008 I knew you<br />would. It's good to see you.
4257220 4258053 Jolanda!
4258262 4261471 Get out here, we got company.<br />And bring some tequila.
4261682 4264800 -Hey, big John. <i>¿Cómo te va?</i><br />-What's up?
4265019 4266854 Who's this big guy?
4266938 4271899 He's cool, Enrique. He's<br />with me. He's, uh... Uncle Bob.
4272109 4273941 Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
4274153 4276566 Uncle Bob, huh?
4277156 4279648 Okay. Okay!
4281035 4282244 How are you?
4282328 4285617 How are you? You've grown so much.
4285832 4287323 Drink?
4291629 4292870 Uncle Bob?
4293965 4297959 Hey, Sarita! You're<br />pretty famous, all over the goddamn TV.
4298177 4300715 Pictures of you, John,<br />your big friend here.
4300930 4303638 Cops are<br />going nuts looking for you.
4306561 4307811 I just came for my stuff.
4307895 4310353 I need clothes, food<br />and one of your trucks.
4310565 4312649 How about the fillings<br />out of my fucking teeth?
4312733 4315225 Now, Enrique!
4316279 4320068 -You two, you're on weapons detail.<br />-Come on. Let's go.
4340970 4343383 One thing about my mom
4345224 4347341 she always plans ahead.
4357904 4358860 Excellent.
4369707 4373246 This is my best truck I got,<br />but the starter motor's gone.
4373461 4375248 You got time to change it out?
4375463 4378501 Yeah. I'm gonna wait till<br />dark to cross the border.
4381177 4383254 See, I grew up in places like this,
4383296 4385466 so I just thought<br />that's how people lived,
4385681 4390176 riding around in helicopters,<br />learning how to blow shit up.
4395066 4396682 That's definitely you.
4408329 4410912 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung around with were geeks,
4411123 4414787 but there was this one<br />guy, he was kinda cool.
4415002 4418166 -He taught me engines.<br />-Hold here.
4419131 4421544 Mom screwed it up, of course.
4421759 4423796 She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day
4424011 4426378 and me being this world leader.
4427181 4431175 -That'd be all she wrote.<br />-Torque wrench, please.
4433604 4434685 Here.
4435731 4440146 -I wish I could've met my real dad.<br />-You will.
4440361 4444947 Yeah, I guess. When<br />I'm, like, 45, I think.
4446242 4449406 I sent him back through time to 1984.
4450246 4451487 Man!
4453207 4455494 He hasn't even been born yet.
4457253 4459210 It messes with your head.
4461841 4464458 -The other bolt.<br />-Oh. Here.
4471434 4474848 Mom and him were only<br />together for one night.
4475062 4480228 She still loves him, I guess.<br />I see her crying sometimes.
4480443 4484857 She denies it totally, of course, like<br />she got something stuck in her eye.
4489118 4490609 Why do you cry?
4491746 4493533 -You mean people?<br />-Yeah.
4493748 4496206 I don't know. We just cry.
4497168 4499501 You know, when it hurts.
4505801 4510796 -Pain causes it?<br />-Uh... no. It's different.
4511015 4514101 It's when there's nothing wrong<br />with you, but you hurt anyways.
4514185 4515596 -Get it?<br />-No.
4516979 4518561 All right, my man!
4518773 4521982 <i>-No problemo.</i><br />-Give me five.
4524528 4526440 Just put out your hand, like this.
4527823 4531533 All right! Now hit me. Give<br />me five. Do the same thing.
4531744 4533781 All right!
4536707 4539040 Okay, that's good. Up high! High five!
4540169 4541285 Five low.
4541504 4542995 Too slow.
4546175 4548292 I'm just kidding. One more time.
4548511 4550594 Good. Now try it. Good!
4550805 4552546 Now do me. Give me five.
4554266 4556258 <i>Watching John with the machine,</i>
4556477 4558639 <i>it was suddenly so clear.</i>
4558854 4561813 <i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>
4562024 4565688 <i>It would never leave him<br />and it would never hurt him,</i>
4565903 4569317 <i>never shout at him<br />or get drunk and hit him</i>
4569532 4571832 <i>or say it was too busy<br />to spend time with him.</i>
4572868 4577579 <i>It would always be there<br />and it would die to protect him.</i>
4579333 4582383 <i>Of all the would-be fathers who<br />came and went over the years,</i>
4582545 4586880 <i>this thing, this machine, was<br />the only one who measured up.</i>
4587883 4592298 <i>In an insane world, it<br />was the sanest choice.</i>
4625337 4630173 Come here, darling.
4689944 4692152 Hey, let's try this one.
4697534 4699070 There we go.
4805309 4807852 She said you go<br />south with him like you planned.
4807936 4810929 -She'll meet you tomorrow.<br />-Mom!
4811148 4812889 Mom, wait!
4828374 4830081 "No fate".
4831418 4833626 "No fate, but what we make."
4835798 4837414 My father told her this.
4840427 4845013 I mean, I made him memorize it<br />in the future as a message to her.
4846266 4851432 Never mind. Now, okay,<br />the whole thing goes...
4851647 4854264 The future's not set.
4854483 4857897 There's no fate, but what<br />we make for ourselves.
4858112 4862607 -She intends to change the future.<br />-Yeah, I guess.
4864076 4865783 Oh, shit!
4865994 4867781 -Dyson.<br />-Yeah.
4867996 4871364 Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
4871583 4873449 She's gonna blow him away.
4873669 4875535 Come on! Let's go!
4875754 4877416 Let's go! Come on!
4888183 4891176 -This is tactically dangerous.<br />-Drive faster.
4891395 4895139 The T-1000 has the same files<br />that I do. It knows what I know.
4895357 4899852 -It might anticipate this move.<br />-I don't care. We gotta stop her.
4900070 4902437 Killing Dyson might prevent the war.
4902656 4904363 I don't care!
4904575 4906362 Haven't you learned anything yet?
4906577 4909027 Haven't you figured out<br />why you can't kill people?
4914960 4917504 Danny, I told you<br />to go to bed. I'm not kidding.
4917588 4920831 Just a couple of minutes, Mom!
4929308 4931516 Danny, your time is up!
4931727 4934515 Come brush your teeth and get to bed.
4963258 4964465 Danny!
4965928 4967544 Ugh!
4976230 4979974 -Daddy!<br />-Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!
4981693 4982729 Miles?
4986490 4987901 Miles!
4988116 4990403 -Tarissa, run!<br />-Oh, my God!
4997626 4999538 Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!
4999753 5000869 Run!
5001088 5002704 Oh, Jesus! Miles!
5022067 5024150 -Daddy!<br />-Danny! Danny!
5024361 5027854 -Nobody fucking move!<br />-Don't hurt my daddy!
5028073 5031737 Get down on the floor,<br />bitch. Get down now!
5031952 5033693 Get out of the way.
5033912 5035494 Don't hurt him!
5037207 5038743 Get on the floor now!
5041044 5043502 Just let the boy go.
5043714 5046548 Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
5046758 5049216 It's all your fault, motherfucker.
5049428 5051545 -It's all your fault!<br />-What?
5051763 5053755 I'm not gonna let you do it.
5072409 5073525 Shhh!
5077789 5078996 Shhh.
5105859 5108226 Shit! We're too late!
5112449 5113439 Check them.
5117162 5120655 Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?
5121625 5123161 Look at me.
5125170 5129251 I almost... I almost...
5139059 5143099 It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay.<br />We'll figure something out. Okay?
5145065 5146397 I promise.
5150278 5155444 -You came here to stop me.<br />-Yeah, I did.
5158537 5160324 I love you, John.
5162249 5164332 I always have.
5165794 5167626 I know.
5174094 5176131 Deep penetration.
5177889 5179676 No shattered bone.
5179891 5182679 You hold here. The pressure<br />should stop the bleeding.
5193613 5196777 -Who are you people?<br />-Show him.
5200078 5204118 Danny, I want you to come with<br />me right now. Show me your room.
5217179 5220297 Oh, God! No!
5232778 5235065 Oh, my God!
5244331 5245822 Oh, my God.
5246041 5248499 Now, listen to me very carefully.
5250921 5254289 Nuclear winter effects<br />caused massive cooling...
5254508 5258548 <i>Dyson listened while<br />the Terminator laid it all down.</i>
5258762 5262346 <i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>
5262557 5265595 <i>The history of things to come.</i>
5266561 5268934 <i>It's not every day that you find out</i>
5268976 5271848 <i>you're responsible<br />for three billion deaths.</i>
5272067 5274650 <i>He took it pretty well.</i>
5276071 5278654 I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
5285163 5289749 You're judging me on<br />things I haven't even done yet.
5293505 5296122 How were we supposed to know?
5298218 5299834 Yeah!
5300053 5301544 Right.
5302472 5305556 How were you supposed to know?
5305767 5309351 Fucking men like you<br />built the hydrogen bomb.
5309563 5313773 Men like you thought it up.
5317571 5320609 You think you're so creative.
5320824 5323862 You don't know what it's<br />like to really create something,
5324077 5327661 to create a life, to feel<br />it growing inside you.
5327873 5330249 All you know how to create<br />is death and destruction.
5330333 5331699 Mom!
5332669 5336288 We need to be a little more<br />constructive here. Okay?
5336506 5338591 We still have to stop this<br />from happening, don't we?
5338675 5340382 But I thought...
5341595 5345430 Aren't we changing things right<br />now, changing the way it goes?
5345640 5349179 That's right. There's no way I'm<br />gonna finish the new processor.
5349394 5352057 Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.
5352272 5355856 -I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.<br />-That's not good enough.
5356067 5359060 -No one must follow your work.<br />-Right.
5360155 5363990 All right, then we have to<br />destroy all the stuff at the lab:
5364200 5368615 the files, the disk drives,<br />everything, everything here.
5369456 5372290 Everything. I don't care.
5374294 5375127 The chip.
5375712 5377380 -Do you know about the chip?<br />-What chip?
5377464 5379090 They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.
5379174 5380550 It must be from the other one like you.
5380634 5385004 -The CPU from the first Terminator.<br />-Son of a bitch! I knew it!
5385221 5387804 They told us not to<br />ask where they got it.
5388016 5390224 Those lying motherfuckers.
5390435 5392228 It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.
5392312 5396014 I mean, it was smashed, it<br />didn't work, but it gave us ideas,
5396232 5399100 took us in new directions,<br />things we would've never th...
5401363 5403355 All my work was based on it.
5403573 5405235 It must be destroyed.
5407577 5410536 Can you get us in? Past security?
5410747 5413660 I think so, yeah. When?
5417712 5418668 Now?
5422926 5425589 <i>The future,<br />always so clear to me,</i>
5425804 5428717 <i>had become like a<br />black highway at night.</i>
5428932 5434473 <i>We were in uncharted territory now,<br />making up history as we went along.</i>
5469931 5474426 Hi. Uh... Carl, right?
5476187 5478356 Friends from out of<br />town. I just thought I'd...
5478440 5479273 Hi!
5479691 5481692 ...take 'em upstairs and show 'em around.
5481776 5484940 Mr. Dyson, you know the rules<br />concerning visitors in the lab.
5485155 5487147 I need written authorization...
5488366 5492076 -I insist.<br />-Don't even think about it.
5503048 5504584 Come on. It's okay.
5506009 5509303 It takes two keys to open the vault.<br />They have to be turned simultaneously.
5509387 5512050 The other one is in a<br />locker at the security station.
5513683 5514924 Gibbons?
5518188 5522853 Gibbons! Come on, man! You<br />can't leave the desk like that!
5525153 5526394 Gibbons!
5527906 5529192 Oh, shit.
5547175 5549212 My card should access this.
5552931 5555048 -What? What is it?<br />-Damn it.
5556309 5558096 The silent alarm's been tripped.
5564234 5567022 It's neutralized all the<br />codes in the entire building.
5567237 5570821 Nothing will open anywhere<br />now. We have to abort.
5572075 5573486 No.
5575203 5578367 We go all the way. Okay?
5580667 5584331 You guys get started on<br />the lab. I can open this.
5584546 5586088 I think it's that guy from the mall.
5586172 5587083 It is!
5587298 5589460 It's him and the woman.
5590802 5593636 Look, just send everything<br />you got in the area right now.
5596224 5599524 I have a personal entry<br />code for the lab. It may still work.
5604149 5606311 -It's no good.<br />-Let me try mine.
5611573 5613530 John, fire in the hold!
5625712 5630377 Wait! You can't go in there.<br />The fire set off the halon system.
5637682 5640015 You have to wait until the gas clears.
5642645 5643761 Put this on.
5658036 5660278 All right, let's get to work.
5681684 5684854 <i>All units in the<br />vicinity and all units able to respond,</i>

5776404 5777736 Uh-oh.
