870453 871921 This next patient is interesting.
872121 874590 I've been following<br />the case for years.
874791 876793 A 29-year-old female,
879212 881761 diagnosed as acute<br />schizo-affective disorder.
881964 884012 The usual indicators:<br />Depression, anxiety,
884217 886766 violent acting out,<br />delusions of persecution.
893434 896563 The delusional architecture<br />is fairly unique.
896771 899615 She believes that a machine<br />called the Terminator,
899816 901033 which looked human, of course,
901234 903828 was sent back through time<br />to kill her.
904028 905154 That's original.
905363 908082 And also,<br />that the father of her child
908282 911126 was a soldier<br />sent back to protect her.
911327 913625 - No?<br />- He was from the future too.

932807 934684 Fine, Sarah.
935893 941070 She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap<br />with my pen a few weeks ago.

955872 956872 Lewis.
956914 959514 I don't like to see the patients<br />disrupting their rooms like this.
959709 962804 - See she takes her Thorazine.<br />- Sure. I'll take care of it.
975558 977435 Time to take you meds, Connor.
978394 979987 You take it.
980480 983359 You gotta be good.<br />You're up for review this afternoon.
983983 985360 I'm not taking it.

1049298 1051676 That's right, Officer.<br />What's he done now?
1052510 1055229 - Could I speak with him, please?<br />- You could if he were here.
1055429 1058148 He took off on his bike this morning<br />so he could be anywhere.
1058349 1061853 - Do you have a photograph of John?<br />- Yeah. Hold on.
1064814 1067158 You gonna tell me what this is about?
1067358 1069235 I just need to ask him<br />a few questions.
1071696 1074700 He's a good-looking boy.<br />Do you mind if I keep this picture?
1074907 1078161 No, go on. There was a guy here<br />this morning looking for him, too.
1078369 1080087 Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
1080288 1082211 Has that got something<br />to do with this?
1084625 1088471 No. I wouldn't worry about him.

1145686 1149736 - She's pretty cool, huh?<br />- No, she's a complete psycho.
1149940 1153570 That's why she's at Pescadero.<br />It's a mental institute, OK?
1154445 1156322 She tried to blow up<br />a computer factory,
1156530 1157827 but she got shot and arrested.

1209834 1211381 Where's our son, Sarah?
1212461 1214555 They took him away from me.
1214880 1218009 - He's the target now.<br />- I know!
1218217 1220094 He's alone.<br />You have to protect him.
1220302 1221599 I know.
1222638 1224561 You tell me how I am supposed<br />to do that.
1225349 1226976 He doesn't even<br />believe me anymore.
1228227 1229319 I've lost him.
1229645 1231272 You're strong, Sarah.
1231605 1233824 - Stronger than you ever thought.<br />- No.
1235276 1236619 On your feet, soldier!
1238779 1241248 I love you. I always will.
1243868 1246712 - I need you.<br />- I'll always be with you.
1251167 1252840 Remember the message?
1254545 1256013 "The future is not set.
1257381 1260851 "There is no fate<br />but what we make for ourselves."
1281197 1282449 Stay with me.
1283657 1286080 There's not much time left<br />in the world, Sarah.
1293834 1295552 Kyle, don't go!
1307765 1309017 Kyle!
1381672 1384926 It's like a giant strobe light,
1385634 1387511 burning right to my eyes.
1392057 1394151 Somehow I can still see.
1405779 1408874 We know<br />the dream's the same every night.
1409241 1412415 - Why do I have to...<br />- Please continue.
1416332 1418835 Children look like burnt paper.
1420586 1422054 Black.
1423005 1424632 Not moving.
1426550 1429394 And then the blast wave hits them.
1438354 1440777 And they fly apart like leaves.
1442733 1447910 Dreams of cataclysm,<br />the end of the world are very common.
1449907 1454003 It's not a dream, you moron.<br />It's real.
1454203 1457958 - I know the date it happens.<br />- I'm sure it feels very real to you.
1458165 1463262 On August 29 1997, it's gonna feel<br />pretty fuckin' real to you, too!
1464546 1466924 Anybody not wearing<br />two-million sunblock
1467132 1469635 is gonna have<br />a real bad day. Get it?
1470135 1472854 God! You think you're safe and alive.
1473055 1475228 You're already dead. Everybody!
1475432 1477855 Him. You. You're dead already.
1478060 1480813 This whole place,<br />everything you see is gone!
1481021 1483991 You're the one<br />living in a fucking dream, Silberman!
1484191 1484987 Cos I know it happened!
1485192 1486785 It happened!
1498080 1500003 I feel much better now.
1501208 1502960 Clearer.
1503168 1508516 Yes, your attitude has been<br />much improved lately.
1517725 1520069 It's helped me to have a goal,
1520853 1523322 something to look forward to.
1523522 1524569 What is that?
1525441 1530914 Well, you said that if I showed<br />improvement after six months,
1531113 1533662 you would transfer me<br />to the minimum security wing
1533866 1536961 and I could have visitors.
1538245 1541545 Well, it's been six months and...
1543459 1545587 I was looking forward<br />to seeing my son.
1546795 1548297 I see.
1551467 1556564 Let's go back to what you were saying<br />about those Terminator machines.
1556764 1560018 Now you think they don't exist?
1560225 1562444 They don't exist.
1562644 1564237 I know that now.
1564438 1566236 But you've told me<br />on many occasions
1566440 1569785 about how you crushed one<br />in a hydraulic press.
1571153 1574157 If I had, there would have been<br />some evidence.
1574364 1576662 They would have found something<br />at the factory.
1576867 1578869 I see.
1579078 1582924 So, you don't believe any more<br />that the company covered it up?
1585084 1587553 No. Why would they?
1588462 1590715 Let's try a new position right there.
1590923 1595099 The neuronal sensors are correct,<br />because it works.
1595302 1597805 - Right.<br />- Those neurons are all centred.
1598680 1600682 Maybe<br />the inhibitor circuits failed...
1600891 1601983 Mr Dyson?
1602810 1605859 Mr Dyson, the materials team<br />is running another...
1607022 1608569 - Mr Dyson.<br />- Yes?
1608774 1611618 The materials team is running<br />another series this afternoon.
1611819 1614663 You have to sign for the...<br />Er... it.
1614863 1617787 - You have to sign it out.<br />- OK. Come on. I'll get it.
1619576 1620623 Mr Dyson,
1620828 1622847 I know I haven't been here long, but<br />I was wondering if you could tell me,
1622871 1625044 - I mean, if you know...<br />- Know what?
1625249 1627798 Well, if you know<br />where "it" came from.
1628001 1631301 I asked them that very same question<br />once. You know what they told me?
1631505 1632677 "Don't ask."
1639388 1641482 - Good morning, Mr Dyson.<br />- How's it going?
1642474 1643771 Insert key.
1643976 1646946 Left on three, two, one, turn.
1650858 1652618 - How are the wife and kids?<br />- Great. Thanks.
1652818 1653990 There you go.
1681805 1684274 So,<br />what do you think, Doctor?
1685350 1687102 I have shown improvement, haven't I?
1688478 1691527 Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
1692441 1694068 I know how smart you are.
1694818 1696818 I think you're just telling me<br />what I want to hear.
1698030 1700624 I don't think you really believe<br />what you're telling me today.
1700908 1702626 I think if I put you<br />in minimum security,
1702826 1704828 you'll just try to escape again.
1709917 1712511 You have to let me see my son.
1713462 1714964 Please.
1716465 1717762 Please.
1719051 1722931 He's in great danger.<br />He's naked without me.
1723138 1724890 If I could just make a phone call...
1725098 1728022 Afraid not. Not for a while.
1729895 1732239 I don't see any choice<br />but to recommend to the review board
1732439 1734737 that you stay here<br />for another six months.
1738070 1739822 I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
1742407 1745661 - Get her off of me!<br />- You son of a bitch!
1745869 1748122 10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!
1749790 1752551 - You don't know what you're doing!<br />- Get some restraints in here now!
1755170 1757798 You don't know what you're doing!
1762219 1764267 Model citizen.
1803635 1806229 You just missed him.<br />He was here 15 minutes ago.
1806430 1808023 He said he was going to the galleria?
1808223 1809270 Yeah.
1809474 1811101 The galleria?
1857147 1859525 I'm gonna get some quarters.<br />I'll be back, all right?
1874581 1877209 - Oh, no!<br />- Girls, do you know John Connor?
1877417 1878919 No.
1881088 1884968 - Hey, do you know this guy?<br />- Nah, I don't know him.
1891556 1893149 - John.<br />- Not now.
1893350 1896194 Hey, there's this cop<br />scoping for you. Check it out.
1899648 1901571 - He's right over there.<br />- Split, man.
1901775 1903698 - Just go.<br />- Yeah.
1908949 1909950 I saw that kid...
1910158 1911284 Hey!
1925632 1927350 Hey! You're not supposed<br />to be in here!
1945527 1947074 Hey!
1953201 1954248 Get down.
2025398 2027196 Mister, are you all right?
2045043 2046090 Come on!
2086334 2087677 Goddamn!
2290205 2291627 Agh!
2366823 2369201 OK. Time out. Stop the bike.
2369409 2371332 Time out. Come on, stop the bike.
2385174 2387768 Holy shit.<br />Now, don't take this the wrong way.
2387969 2390017 - But you are a Terminator, right?<br />- Yes.
2390221 2394067 - Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.<br />- No?
2404777 2408873 Holy shit! You're really real.
2411284 2412752 I mean...
2415413 2419793 You're like a machine underneath,<br />right? But sort of alive outside?
2420001 2421799 I'm a cybernetic organism:
2422003 2424552 Living tissue<br />over metal endoskeleton.
2439437 2441485 This is intense.
2441689 2444408 Get a grip, John. OK.
2447070 2449072 You're not here to kill me.
2449280 2453205 I figured that part out for myself.<br />So what's the deal?
2453409 2456003 My mission is to protect you.
2456204 2458707 Yeah? Who sent you?
2459999 2461000 You did.
2461209 2462552 35 years from now,
2462752 2466131 you reprogrammed me to be<br />your protector here, in this time.
2466339 2469092 Oh, this is deep.
2491698 2494542 This other guy,<br />he's a terminator like you, right?
2494742 2498212 Not like me.<br />A T-1000, advanced prototype.
2499914 2504340 - More advanced than you are?<br />- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
2505253 2507676 - What the hell does that mean?<br />- Liquid metal.
2509424 2510550 Where are we going?
2510758 2512510 We have to get out of the city<br />immediately
2512719 2513971 and avoid the authorities.
2514762 2517436 Listen, I got to stop by my house.<br />I want to pick up some stuff.
2517640 2521611 Negative. The T-1000 would definitely<br />try to reacquire you there.
2521811 2524485 - You sure?<br />- I would.
2535241 2537835 Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...
2540163 2541506 ...but I gotta warn them.
2541706 2544050 Shit! You got a quarter?
2552884 2555763 - Hello.<br />- 'Janelle, it's me.'
2555970 2558189 - John?<br />- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'
2558389 2560687 - Are you guys OK?<br />- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'
2560892 2563896 - Are you all right?<br />- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'
2564103 2567573 John, it's late.<br />I was beginning to worry about you.
2567774 2570323 If you hurry home, we can sit down<br />and have dinner together.
2570526 2571948 I'm making beef stew.
2572153 2574247 Something's wrong.<br />She's never this nice.
2574447 2576825 John, where are you?
2577033 2579786 What the hell is the goddamn dog<br />barking at?
2579994 2583123 Hey, shut up,<br />you worthless piece of shit!
2583331 2584674 The dog's really barking.
2584874 2587234 You were gonna tell the kid<br />to get rid of that fucking mutt.
2591005 2593633 John, honey, it's late.<br />Please don't make me worry.
2593841 2597846 - Could he already be there?<br />- Honey, are you OK?
2598054 2600227 I'm right here. I'm fine.
2600431 2601933 'Are you sure you're all right?'
2602141 2604940 - What's the dog's name?<br />- Max.
2605561 2607780 Janelle, what's wrong<br />with Wolfie?
2607980 2610449 I can hear him barking. Is he OK?
2610650 2613324 Wolfie's fine, honey.<br />Wolfie's just fine.
2614654 2616156 Where are you?
2617949 2619826 Your foster parents are dead.
2656821 2658823 No, no. I need a minute here.
2659031 2663207 You're telling me that this thing<br />can imitate anything it touches?
2663411 2665755 Anything it samples<br />by physical contact.
2665955 2667753 Get real.
2667957 2671587 It could disguise itself<br />as a pack of cigarettes?
2671794 2673467 No, only an object of equal size.
2673671 2676094 Why not just become a bomb<br />or something to get me?
2676674 2680019 It can't form complex machines.<br />Guns, explosives have chemicals,
2680219 2682347 moving parts.<br />It doesn't work that way.
2682638 2685016 - But it can form solid metal shapes.<br />- Like what?
2685641 2687234 Knives and stabbing weapons.
2718174 2720302 These were taken<br />by a video surveillance camera
2720635 2723559 at the West Highland police station<br />in 1984.
2725431 2728355 He killed<br />17 police officers that night.
2729977 2732105 Men with families...
2733481 2735074 ...children.
2736567 2740913 These were taken at a mall<br />in Reseda today.
2742281 2746206 Miss Connor,<br />we know you know who this guy is.
2748371 2752672 Look, I just sat here and told you<br />that your son is missing.
2752875 2754752 That the foster parents<br />have been murdered.
2754961 2757214 We know this guy's involved.
2758422 2762268 Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br />Don't you care?
2766639 2772772 - We're wasting our time. Let's go.<br />- Sorry, guys.
2772979 2775482 She's grown more and more<br />disconnected from reality
2775690 2777192 as time goes on.
2777400 2779073 I'm afraid she can't help us now.
2779277 2782952 If she clears at all and can<br />give us anything, I'll call you.
2783155 2784498 Sure.
2784699 2787452 Douglas,<br />take her back to her room, please.
2787660 2788752 Yes, sir.
2790413 2792461 Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
2792665 2797637 You see, we spent a lot of time<br />in Nicaragua and places like that.
2799755 2803385 For a while there, she was with<br />this crazy ex-Green Beret guy
2803676 2804802 running guns.
2805011 2807855 Then there were some other guys.
2808055 2809935 She'd shack up with anybody<br />she could learn from
2810016 2813236 so she could teach me how to be<br />this great military leader.
2815104 2817027 Then she gets busted.
2817231 2820735 It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's<br />a psycho. Didn't you know?"
2823070 2825070 It's like everything<br />I'd been brought up to believe
2825197 2826949 was all made-up bullshit.
2827158 2829581 I hated her for that.
2832913 2835541 But everything she said was true.
2836917 2838794 She knew.
2841047 2843049 And nobody believed her.
2844884 2846727 Not even me.
2848763 2850515 Listen,<br />we gotta get her out of there.
2850723 2854068 Negative. The T-1000's<br />highest probability for success now
2854268 2855485 will be to copy Sarah Connor
2855686 2857326 and wait for you<br />to make contact with her.
2857396 2859364 Great. What happens to her?
2859565 2862318 Typically, the subject<br />being copied is terminated.
2862526 2865496 Shit! Why didn't you tell me?<br />We gotta go right now!
2865696 2867824 Negative.<br />It's not a mission priority.
2868032 2870034 Fuck you! She's a priority to me!
2871911 2874755 Goddamn it!<br />What's your problem? Damn it!
2874955 2877799 - Help! Help!<br />- This does not help our mission.
2878000 2880344 Get this psycho off of me! Help!
2880544 2883468 Help! I'm being kidnapped!<br />Get this psycho off of me!
2883672 2884672 Let me go!
2889261 2892891 - Why the hell did you do that?<br />- Because you told me to.
2895726 2897399 What?
2902233 2904201 You have to do what I say, huh?
2904402 2906496 That's one of my mission parameters.
2907780 2911284 Prove it. Stand on one foot.
2913494 2914837 Yes!
2917039 2920634 Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
2922128 2924847 - You OK, kid?<br />- Take a hike, bozo.
2925047 2929473 - Let's get outta here, man.<br />- Fuck you, you little dipshit!
2930302 2931895 Dipshit?
2933931 2935933 Put your leg down.
2936142 2940818 - Did you call <i>mói</i> a dipshit?<br />- Just trying to help this punk.
2941021 2943274 Grab this guy.<br />I can't believe he called me...
2943482 2946110 Agh! God! Get him off of me!
2946318 2949367 Now who's the dipshit,<br />you jock douche bag?
2949572 2950789 Get off me!
2956996 2958122 No!
2959373 2961671 Put the gun down, now!
2961876 2965050 - Get outta here!<br />- Come on. Let's split!
2972052 2973895 Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!
2974096 2976098 Of course. I'm a Terminator.
2978434 2980983 Listen to me very carefully, OK?
2981187 2984407 You're not a Terminator anymore,<br />all right?
2984607 2986701 You got that?
2986901 2989245 You just can't go around<br />killing people.
2989445 2990445 Why?
2991280 2993453 What do you mean, why?<br />Cos you can't.
2993657 2994657 Why?
2994700 2997374 Because you just can't.<br />Trust me on this.
3003417 3006887 Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.
3007087 3010512 And I order you to help me.
3076699 3078451 Hm!
3156236 3157283 Hi!
3157488 3161538 - You have a Sarah Connor here?<br />- You're running late, aren't you?
3161742 3163995 They've been in there for an hour.
3164203 3166547 Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.
3168415 3171043 Oh, here come your friends now.
3190729 3192652 Well, that was productive.
3234106 3237110 - Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?<br />- No, thanks.
3237860 3238861 How 'bout a beer?
3239069 3240491 Yeah, right!
3264553 3268023 - Hey, I got a full house.<br />- That's good, Lewis.
3268223 3270146 Must be my lucky day.
3412826 3415204 I think you're right<br />about number 24.
3415412 3418131 Increase the medication<br />to 250 milligrams.
3418332 3420551 - Same time?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3434556 3436729 You!
3441063 3442861 You broke my arm.
3443065 3445659 There are 215 bones<br />in the human body.
3445859 3448408 That's one. Now, don't move.
3454409 3456082 What are you gonna do?
3459706 3461754 Why do we stop now?
3463085 3466806 You gotta promise me<br />you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
3467005 3469474 - Right.<br />- Swear?
3469675 3471052 What?
3471259 3474263 Just put up your hand and say,<br />"I swear I won't kill anyone."
3475430 3479310 - I swear I will not kill anyone.<br />- All right. Let's go.
3486483 3490238 Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,<br />Monday through Friday.
3494533 3498288 - What the hell are you doing?<br />- You son of a bitch! You shot me!
3499955 3501423 You crazy bastard!
3505836 3507964 Don't shoot me again.<br />Don't kill me.
3511758 3513260 He'll live.
3528108 3530110 Son of a bitch!
3531236 3532909 Let's try to remain calm.
3533113 3535091 Open it, or he'll be dead<br />before he hits the floor.
3535115 3537038 There's no way, Connor. Let him go.
3537242 3539370 - Open the door.<br />- It ain't gonna happen.
3539578 3541421 Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.
3541621 3543248 It won't work, Sarah.<br />You're no killer.
3543457 3544800 I don't believe you can do it.
3545000 3546252 You're already dead, Silberman.
3546460 3547940 Everybody dies.<br />You know I believe it.
3548086 3551716 - So don't fuck with me!<br />- Open the door. Open the door.
3558013 3560232 Back off!
3560432 3561729 Get back!
3561933 3563731 I'll pump him full of this shit.<br />I swear!
3565604 3567151 Don't move!
3568482 3571452 - Drop the shit!<br />- Do it! Do it!
3572027 3574325 Get in the office.<br />On the floor, face down.
3574529 3575621 Not you!
3575822 3577324 Open the door.
3580327 3582580 On the floor. Hold it open.<br />Face the wall!
3599805 3601307 Get her! Get her!
3627541 3629088 Sarah!
3629292 3632136 - Hurry up! Open the door!<br />- The door's locked!
3633130 3635098 Let's go! Open it!
3635298 3636298 Get the other door!
3637717 3639560 - She broke it off.<br />- Open it!
3645100 3647273 Let's go around! Come on!<br />Move it!
3672669 3673966 No!
3674171 3675514 No!
3677591 3680561 - No!<br />- Mom, wait!
3680760 3682057 Mom!
3687684 3691234 - Come back here!<br />- No! No!
3691855 3692947 No!
3693148 3694650 - Help her!<br />- Wait here.
3694858 3696360 Hurry UP!
3696568 3698536 He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!
3698737 3699829 Hold her.
3701531 3703078 He'll kill us all!
3724721 3726974 Mom, are you OK? Mom!
3731686 3733984 Come with me, if you want to live.
3734189 3736408 It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.<br />It's OK.
3761216 3762342 Go.
3794833 3797211 What the fuck is it?<br />What the fuck is going on?
3812142 3813485 Get down.
3830076 3831794 No! Mom!
3849929 3851306 Out of the car!
3852849 3853896 Right now!
3878708 3880381 Go!
3890804 3891851 I'm out.
3898812 3900564 - Come on.<br />- Here.
3903274 3905197 Reload.
3914285 3916128 Last one!
3923253 3924880 Hang on.
3951239 3952491 Ready!
3958079 3959422 John!
3966504 3968131 Here, drive.
4021809 4023811 He's not back there.<br />There's nobody behind us.
4024020 4026193 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah.
4028441 4031741 - Can you even see anything?<br />- I see everything.
4034906 4036374 Cool.
4040119 4041666 Come here.
4047794 4049421 I said I was OK.
4050380 4053350 John,<br />it was stupid of you to go there.
4054467 4056595 God damnit! You have to be<br />smarter than that.
4056803 4058271 You almost got yourself killed.
4059639 4061232 What were you thinking?
4062267 4064770 You cannot risk yourself,<br />even for me.
4064978 4066321 Do you understand?
4066521 4070697 You're too important.<br />Do you understand?
4073695 4074696 But...
4076531 4080126 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
4081494 4083713 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
4091045 4092547 What's wrong with your eyes?
4094716 4096059 Nothing.
4106060 4108358 So, what's your story?
4118948 4119995 You OK?
4120199 4121621 Fine.
4123536 4126631 Say, that's a nice bike.
4148645 4150773 Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.
4158613 4161583 Listen,<br />do you know what you're doing?
4161783 4164627 I have detailed files<br />on human anatomy.
4165578 4170550 I bet! Makes you<br />a more efficient killer, right?
4170750 4171797 Correct.
4178508 4179805 Does it hurt when you get shot?
4181844 4184688 I sense injuries. The data<br />could be called pain.
4187225 4188977 John, help me with the light.
4189227 4191195 - Will these heal up?<br />- Yes.
4191562 4194862 Good. If you can't pass for human,<br />you're not much good to us.
4195817 4198570 How long do you live,<br />I mean "last", whatever?
4199237 4201490 120 years with<br />my existing power cell.
4201989 4204458 Can you learn stuff you<br />haven't been programmed with?
4204826 4209627 So you can be...<br />you know, more human?
4210581 4212049 Not such a dork all the time?
4216379 4219383 My CPU is a neural-net processor,<br />a learning computer,
4219632 4222636 hat Skynet presets to READ<br />only when we are sent out alone.
4225555 4227432 Doesn't want you<br />to do too much thinking.
4227974 4229021 No.
4230810 4232528 Can we reset the switch?
4250997 4254592 Rotate the two locking cylinders<br />counterclockwise.
4261090 4262090 Do it.
4270892 4272394 Now open the port cover.
4275813 4277861 Pull to break the seal.
4281861 4285365 Good, now remove<br />the shock damping assembly.
4289076 4291204 You can now access the CPU.
4292622 4294090 - Do you see it?<br />- Yes.
4294957 4296834 Pull the CPU by its base tap.
4298795 4299795 Pull.
4337750 4338842 Can you see the pin switch?
4339418 4340670 No!
4342421 4344344 - Out of my way, John!<br />- Don't kill him!
4345716 4348139 "It", John, not "him".
4348386 4351310 Okay, "it". But we need "it".
4352139 4353732 Listen to me. Listen.
4354767 4356269 We're better off on our own.
4356853 4360027 He's the only proof of<br />the future, the war and that.
4361482 4362574 Maybe.
4365403 4366780 I don't trust it.
4367697 4368949 But he's my friend, alright?
4370074 4372418 You don't know what it's like<br />to kill these things.
4372952 4375751 If something goes wrong,<br />this could be our last chance.
4375955 4378549 If I'm supposed to<br />be this military leader,
4378749 4381798 maybe you start listening<br />to my ideas once in a while.
4385506 4389136 'Cause if my own mother won't,<br />how do you expect anyone else to?
4404442 4407286 Alright, play it your way.
4414785 4416787 Was there a problem?
4416996 4418373 No problem.
4420082 4421299 None whatsoever.
4454951 4456453 Are we learning yet?
4469465 4472435 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
4476347 4478190 Just head south.
4486732 4488200 Keep it under 65.
4488401 4491029 - We don't wanna be pulled over.<br />- Affirmative.
4491862 4496743 No, no, no. You gotta listen<br />to the way people talk.
4496951 4500376 You don't say "affirmative"<br />or some shit like that.
4500579 4502752 You say, "No problemo."
4502957 4506757 And if someone comes up to you<br />with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"
4506961 4511091 And if you want to shine them on,<br />it's "Hasta la vista, baby."
4511966 4513718 <i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.
4514760 4516478 Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."
4516679 4519478 And if someone gets upset,<br />you say, "Chill out."
4519682 4524108 - Or you can do combinations.<br />- Chill out, dick-wad.
4525021 4526944 That's great. See? You're getting it.
4527148 4529071 <i>No problemo.</i>
4539410 4542630 - You got any cash?<br />- I got a couple of hundred bucks.
4542955 4544172 I'll give you half.
4545166 4546292 Mom!
4547752 4549049 Get some food.
4551714 4553512 No sense of humor.
4559513 4561186 And that's another thing:
4561515 4563017 Lighten up a bit.
4564018 4568114 This severe routine is getting old.<br />You're acting like such a geek.
4568355 4569823 Smile once in a while.
4570066 4571409 Smile?
4571734 4574112 Yeah. You know, smile.
4574445 4575492 Watch.
4576989 4580289 Hi. Nice place you got here.<br />How's business?
4581202 4582670 Gimme a break.
4584080 4586674 Okay. Bad example.
4587541 4590511 See that guy over there?<br />That's a smile.
4610773 4611820 That's good.
4612066 4615195 You could practice<br />in front of a mirror or something.
4622660 4623912 Want some of my fries?
4634672 4635798 Do you need any help?
4636507 4637507 No.
4637675 4639393 - Got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4639593 4641061 - Got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4648435 4650108 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4652773 4654025 People, I mean.
4657027 4659029 It's in your nature<br />to destroy yourselves.
4660197 4662825 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4663033 4665912 Break it up<br />before I wring both of your necks.
4668038 4672384 I need to know how Skynet gets built,<br />who's responsible.
4672585 4676055 The man most directly responsible<br />is Miles Bennett Dyson.
4676964 4678090 Who is that?
4678299 4681428 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
4684722 4686349 Why him?
4686557 4688810 In a few months he creates<br />a revolutionary type
4689018 4690270 of microprocessor.
4691020 4694274 - Go on. Then what?<br />- In three years,
4694481 4696449 Cyberdyne will become the largest<br />supplier
4696650 4697902 of military computer systems.
4698903 4701702 All Stealth bombers are upgraded<br />with Cyberdyne computers,
4701906 4703249 becoming fully unmanned.
4703449 4706578 Afterwards, they fly<br />with a perfect operational record.
4706785 4709163 The Skynet Funding bill is passed.
4709371 4712671 The system goes on-line<br />on August 4, 1997.
4712875 4715799 Human decisions are removed<br />from strategic defence.
4716003 4718722 Skynet begins to learn<br />at a geometric rate.
4718923 4723099 It becomes self-aware at 02:14am<br />Eastern time, August 29.
4724261 4726605 In a panic,<br />they try to pull the plug.
4727932 4730151 - Skynet fights back.<br />- Yes.
4730351 4732854 It launches its missiles<br />against the targets in Russia.
4733062 4736111 Why attack Russia?<br />Aren't they our friends now?
4736315 4738568 Because Skynet knows<br />that the Russian counterattack
4738776 4740574 will eliminate its enemies over here.
4740778 4742280 Jesus!
4745699 4747019 How much do you know about Dyson?
4749662 4751335 I have detailed files.
4752915 4754383 Want to know everything.
4756001 4759380 What he looks like.<br />Where he lives. Everything.
4771267 4772519 Miles!
4794707 4797961 - You going to work all day?<br />- I'm sorry, baby.
4798419 4800171 This thing is kicking my ass.
4800629 4804384 It's Sunday. You promised to take<br />the kids to Raging Waters today.
4806302 4809522 I can't. I'm on a roll.
4823360 4826614 This is gonna blow 'em away.<br />It's a neural-net processor.
4826864 4828332 I know. You told me.
4828574 4831327 It thinks and learns like we do.
4831785 4834208 It's superconducting<br />at room temperature.
4834455 4838426 Other computers are just<br />pocket calculators by comparison.
4840711 4842384 Why is that so important?
4842629 4845098 I need to know,<br />'cause sometimes I feel like
4845549 4847677 I'm going crazy here.
4849219 4851142 Baby, I am this close.
4852181 4853228 Come here.
4855559 4859405 Imagine a jet airliner<br />with a pilot that never gets tired,
4859646 4862820 never makes mistakes,<br />never shows up with a hangover.
4865319 4867162 Meet the pilot.
4867738 4871914 Why did we get married?<br />Have children? You don't need us.
4872659 4875833 Your heart and your mind<br />are in here.
4876163 4878336 But it doesn't love you like we do.
4886757 4889180 I'm sorry. Really.
4889927 4893522 How about spending some time<br />with your other babies?
4896558 4898276 - Raging Waters?<br />- Yeah!
4928507 4930134 Wait in the car.
4948694 4950571 Enrique!
4950779 4953123 Are you here?
4968547 4970147 You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
4972301 4978104 And you... are always like a snake.
4980225 4982227 It's great<br />to see you, Connor!
4982436 4983516 I told you I would be back.
4983687 4986406 I knew you would.<br />It's good to see you.
4986607 4987607 Jolanda!
4987649 4990869 Get out here, we got company.<br />And bring some tequila.
4991069 4994198 - Hey, big John. <i>Cómo Te Va?</i><br />- What's up?
4994406 4996124 Who's this big guy?
4996325 5001297 He's cool, Enrique.<br />He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.
5001497 5003340 Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
5003540 5005963 Uncle Bob, huh?
5006543 5009046 OK. OK!
5010422 5011691 How are you?
5011715 5015015 How are you?<br />You've grown so much.
5015219 5016721 Drink?
5021016 5022268 Uncle Bob?
5023352 5027357 Hey, Sarita! You're pretty<br />famous, all over the goddamn TV.
5027564 5030113 Pictures of you, John,<br />your big friend here.
5030317 5033036 Cops are going nuts<br />looking for you.
5035948 5037074 I just came for my stuff.
5037282 5039751 I need clothes,<br />food and one of your trucks.
5039952 5041920 How about the fillings<br />out of my fucking teeth?
5042120 5044623 Now, Enrique!
5045666 5049466 - You two, you're on weapons detail.<br />- Come on. Let's go.
5070357 5072780 One thing about my mom...
5074611 5076739 ...she always plans ahead.
5087291 5088291 Excellent.
5099469 5103019 This is the best truck I got,<br />but the starter is gone.
5103223 5106067 - You got the time to change it out?<br />- Yeah.
5106268 5108191 I'm gonna wait till dark<br />to cross the border.
5108312 5111316 Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.
5111607 5114235 - You get out tonight too, okay?<br />- Sure.
5115736 5119115 Just drop by any time<br />and totally fuck up my life.
5124703 5127456 See, I grew up in places like this,
5127789 5130463 so I thought<br />that's how people lived:
5131126 5134380 Riding around in helicopters,
5134921 5137015 learning how to blow shit up.
5138842 5143598 But then, when my mom got busted,<br />I got put in a regular school.
5144973 5147442 The other kids were into Nintendo.
5161948 5163746 Are you ever afraid?
5163992 5165289 No.
5169539 5170756 Not even of dying?
5171833 5172925 No.
5177923 5181848 You don't feel any emotion about it<br />one way or another?
5182094 5184722 No.<br />I have to stay functional
5184971 5187019 until the mission is complete.
5191603 5193571 Then it doesn't matter.
5194064 5197614 Yeah. I have to stay functional too.<br />I'm "too important".
5214376 5215844 That's definitely you.
5228098 5230226 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung round with were geeks.
5230434 5234109 But there was this one guy,<br />he was kinda cool.
5234312 5237486 - He taught me engines.<br />- Hold here.
5238442 5240865 Mom screwed it up, of course.
5241069 5243117 She'd always tell 'em about<br />Judgment Day
5243321 5245699 and me being this world leader.
5246491 5250496 - That'd be all she wrote.<br />- Torque wrench, please.
5252914 5254006 Here.
5255041 5259467 - I wish I could've met my real dad.<br />- You will.
5259671 5264268 Yeah, I guess.<br />When I'm, like, 45, I think.
5265552 5268726 I sent him back through time<br />to 1984.
5269556 5270808 Man!
5272517 5274815 He hasn't even been born yet.
5276563 5278531 It messes with your head.
5281151 5283779 - The other bolt.<br />- Oh. Here.
5290744 5294169 Mom and him were only together<br />for one night.
5294372 5299549 She still loves him, I guess.<br />I see her crying sometimes.
5299753 5301175 She denies it totally, of course,
5301379 5304178 like she got something<br />stuck in her eye.
5308428 5309930 Why do you cry?
5311056 5312854 - You mean people?<br />- Yeah.
5313058 5315527 I don't know. We just cry.
5316478 5318822 You know, when it hurts.
5325111 5330117 - Pain causes it?<br />- Er... no. It's different.
5330325 5333295 It's when there's nothing wrong<br />with you, but you hurt anyways.
5333495 5334917 - Get it?<br />- No.
5336289 5337882 All right, my man!
5338083 5341303 - No problemo.<br />- Give me five.
5343839 5345762 Just put out your hand, like this.
5347133 5350854 All right! Now hit me.<br />Give me five. Do the same thing.
5351054 5353102 All right!
5356017 5358361 OK, that's good. Up high! High five!
5359479 5360605 Five low.
5360814 5362316 Too slow.
5365485 5367613 I'm just kidding. One more time.
5367821 5369915 Good. Now try it. Good!
5370115 5371867 Now do me. Give me five.
5373577 5375579 'Watching John<br />with the machine,
5375787 5377960 it was suddenly so clear.
5378164 5381134 'The Terminator would never stop.
5381334 5385009 'It would never leave him<br />and it would never hurt him,
5385213 5388638 'never shout at him<br />or get drunk and hit him
5388842 5391140 'or say it was too busy<br />to spend time with him.
5392178 5396900 'It would always be there<br />and it would die to protect him.
5398643 5401647 'Of all the would-be fathers<br />who came and went over the years,
5401855 5406201 'this thing, this machine,<br />was the only one who measured up.
5407193 5411619 'In an insane world,<br />it was the sanest choice.'
5444648 5449495 Come here, darling.
5509254 5511473 Hey, let's try this one.
5516845 5518392 There we go.
5624619 5627042 She said you go south<br />with him like you planned.
5627247 5630251 - She'll meet you tomorrow.<br />- Mom!
5630458 5632210 Mom, wait!
5647684 5649402 "No fate".
5650728 5652947 "No fate, but what we make."
5655108 5656735 My father told her this.
5659737 5664334 I mean, I made him memorise it<br />in the future as a message to her.
5665577 5670754 Never mind.<br />Now, OK, the whole thing goes...
5670957 5673585 The future's not set.
5673793 5677218 There's no fate,<br />but what we make for ourselves.
5677422 5681928 - She intends to change the future.<br />- Yeah, I guess.
5683386 5685104 Oh, shit!
5685305 5687103 - Dyson.<br />- Yeah.
5687307 5690686 Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
5690894 5692771 She's gonna blow him away.
5692979 5694856 Come on! Let's go!
5695064 5696737 Let's go! Come on!
5707493 5710497 - This is tactically dangerous.<br />- Drive faster.
5710705 5714460 The T-1000 has the same files<br />that I do. It knows what I know.
5714667 5719173 - It might anticipate this move.<br />- I don't care. We gotta stop her.
5719380 5721758 Killing Dyson might prevent the war.
5721966 5723684 I don't care!
5723885 5725683 Haven't you learned anything yet?
5725887 5728060 Haven't you figured out<br />why you can't kill people?
5730934 5733778 Look, maybe you don't care<br />if you live or die.
5734020 5737069 But everybody's not like that!<br />We have feelings.
5737273 5739196 We hurt. We're afraid.
5741778 5746033 You gotta learn this stuff.<br />I'm not kidding. It's important.
5782527 5786327 Danny, I told you<br />to go to bed. I'm not kidding.
5786531 5788533 Just a couple of minutes,<br />Mom!
5805883 5808056 Danny, your time is up.
5808219 5810938 Come brush your teeth<br />and get to bed.
5839584 5840801 Danny!
5842253 5843880 Ugh!
5852555 5856310 - Daddy!<br />- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!
5858019 5859066 Miles?
5862815 5864237 Miles!
5864442 5866740 - Tarissa, run!<br />- Oh, my God!
5873951 5875874 Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!
5876079 5877205 Run!
5877413 5879040 Oh, Jesus! Miles!
5898393 5900487 - Daddy!<br />- Danny! Danny!
5900686 5904190 - Nobody fucking move!<br />- Don't hurt my daddy!
5904399 5908074 Get down on the floor, bitch.<br />Get down now!
5908277 5910029 Get out of the way.
5910238 5911831 Don't hurt him!
5913533 5915080 Get on the floor now!
5917370 5919839 Just let the boy go.
5920039 5922883 Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
5923084 5925553 It's all your fault, motherfucker.
5925753 5927881 - It's all your fault!<br />- What?
5928089 5930091 I'm not gonna let you do it.
5948734 5949860 Shhh!
5954115 5955332 Shhh.
5982185 5984563 Shit! We're too late!
5988774 5989775 Check them.
5993488 5996992 Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?
5997950 5999497 Look at me.
6001496 6003464 I almost...
6003664 6005587 I almost...
6015384 6019434 It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.<br />We'll figure something out. OK?
6021390 6022733 I promise.
6026604 6031781 - You came here to stop me.<br />- Yeah, I did.
6034862 6036660 I love you, John.
6038574 6040668 I always have.
6042119 6043962 I know.
6050419 6052467 Deep penetration.
6054215 6056013 No shattered bone.
6056217 6059016 You hold here. The pressure<br />should stop the bleeding.
6069939 6073113 - Who are you people?<br />- Show him.
6076404 6080454 Danny, I want you to come with me<br />right now. Show me your room.
6093504 6096633 Oh, God! No!
6109103 6111401 Oh, my God!
6120656 6122158 Oh, my God.
6122366 6124835 Now, listen to me very carefully.
6127246 6130625 Nuclear winter effects<br />caused massive cooling...
6130833 6134883 'Dyson listened while<br />the Terminator laid it all down.
6135087 6138682 'Skynet. Judgment Day.
6138883 6141932 'The history of things to come.
6142887 6144605 'It's not every day that you find out
6144805 6148184 you're responsible<br />for three billion deaths.
6148392 6150986 'He took it pretty well.'
6152396 6154990 I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
6161489 6166086 You're judging me<br />on things I haven't even done yet.
6169830 6172458 How were we supposed to know?
6174543 6176170 Yeah!
6176379 6177881 Right.
6178798 6181893 How were you supposed to know?
6182093 6185688 Fucking men like you<br />built the hydrogen bomb.
6185888 6190109 Men like you thought it up.
6193896 6196945 You think you're so creative.
6197149 6200198 You don't know what it's like<br />to really create something,
6200403 6203998 to create a life,<br />to feel it growing inside you.
6204198 6206451 All you know how to create<br />is death and destruction.
6206659 6208036 Mom!
6208994 6212624 We need to be a little more<br />constructive here. OK?
6212832 6214872 We still have to stop this<br />from happening, don't we?
6215000 6216718 But I thought...
6217920 6221766 Aren't we changing things right now,<br />changing the way it goes?
6221966 6225516 That's right. There's no way<br />I'm gonna finish the new processor.
6225720 6228394 Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.
6228597 6232192 - I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.<br />- That's not good enough.
6232393 6235397 - No one must follow your work.<br />- Right.
6236480 6240326 All right, then we have to destroy<br />all the stuff at the lab:
6240526 6244952 The files, the disk drives,<br />everything, everything here.
6245781 6248625 Everything. I don't care.
6250619 6251619 The chip.
6252037 6253677 - Do you know about the chip?<br />- What chip?
6253789 6255291 They keep it in a vault<br />at Cyberdyne.
6255499 6256935 It must be from<br />the other one like you.
6256959 6261339 - The CPU from the first Terminator.<br />- Son of a bitch! I knew it!
6261547 6264141 They told us<br />not to ask where they got it.
6264341 6266560 Those lying motherfuckers.
6266761 6268434 It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.
6268637 6270765 I mean,<br />it was smashed, it didn't work,
6270973 6272350 but it gave us ideas,
6272558 6275437 took us in new directions,<br />things we would've never Th...
6277688 6279690 All my work was based on it.
6279899 6281572 It must be destroyed.
6283903 6286873 Can you get us in? Past security?
6287072 6289996 I think so, yeah. When?
6294038 6295038 Now?
6299251 6301925 'The future,<br />always so clear to me,
6302129 6305053 'had become<br />like a black highway at night.
6305257 6310809 'We were in uncharted territory now,<br />making up history as we went along.'
6346257 6350763 Hi. Er... Carl, right?
6352513 6354356 Friends from out of town.<br />I just thought I'd...
6354765 6355765 Hi!
6356016 6357893 ...take 'em upstairs<br />and show 'em around.
6358102 6361276 Mr Dyson, you know the rules<br />concerning visitors in the lab.
6361480 6363482 I need written authorisation...
6364692 6368413 - I insist.<br />- Don't even think about it.
6379373 6380920 Come on. It's OK.
6382334 6383774 It takes two keys to open the vault.
6383919 6385512 They have<br />to be turned simultaneously.
6385713 6388387 The other one is in a locker<br />at the security station.
6390009 6391261 Gibbons?
6394513 6399189 Gibbons! Come on, man!<br />You can't leave the desk like that!
6401478 6402730 Gibbons!
6404231 6405528 Oh, shit.
6423500 6425548 My card should access this.
6429256 6431384 - What? What is it?<br />- Damn it.
6432635 6434433 The silent alarm's been tripped.
6440559 6443358 It's neutralised all the codes<br />in the entire building.
6443562 6447157 Nothing will open anywhere now.<br />We have to abort.
6448400 6449822 No.
6451528 6454702 We go all the way. OK?
6456992 6460667 You guys get started on the lab.<br />I can open this.
6460871 6462311 I think it's that guy from the mall.
6462498 6463498 It is!
6463624 6465797 It's him and the woman.
6467127 6469971 Look, just send everything<br />you got in the area right now.
6472549 6475803 I have a personal entry code<br />for the lab. It may still work.
6480474 6482647 - It's no good.<br />- Let me try mine.
6487898 6489866 John, fire in the hold!
6502037 6506713 Wait! You can't go in there.<br />The fire set off the halon system.
6514008 6516352 You have<br />to wait until the gas clears.
6518971 6520097 Put this on.
6534361 6536614 All right, let's get to work.
6558552 6561476 All units in the vicinity,<br />all units able to respond:
6561680 6566186 A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer<br />Street, the Cyberdyne building.

6584870 6586838 Everything behind my desk.
6587081 6589083 All the processors on my left.
6589333 6591586 We'll blow it up with the CP4.
6605390 6606767 Could I...
6607267 6608814 Excuse me...
6611021 6613149 Could I borrow that thing?
6622491 6624914 I worked a lot<br />of years on this thing.
6628956 6633211 - Give me that location again.<br />- 2111, Kramer.
6633460 6637090 The suspects are armed and<br />considered extremely dangerous.
6688307 6689980 All right!
6690184 6691811 7-2-5-6.
6693395 6694395 Yes!
6699109 6700406 Easy money.
6705199 6706542 Uh-oh.
6709244 6711542 Oh, shit! Not good.
6711747 6712919 Not good!
6716752 6720006 - How we doing?<br />- Primer cord is set.
6720214 6722467 One more barrel, two more minutes.
6724509 6729356 - How do we set them off?<br />- Remote control.
6729556 6731809 Piece of cake.
6732017 6733439 - We got company.<br />- Police?
6733644 6736864 - How many?<br />- All of 'em, I think.
6737064 6738987 Go. I'll finish here.
6740442 6741739 Come on.
6742945 6746119 - I'll take care of the police.<br />- Wait! You swore!
6749243 6750495 Trust me.
6763924 6765801 'You at the window!
6766009 6768979 'Drop your weapon and place<br />your hands on top of your head!'
6770430 6773730 - Holy shit!<br />- That's a damn mini-gun!

6882834 6885383 All right, in order to get that out,<br />you have to...
6893095 6896725 We got Skynet by the balls now,<br />don't we? Come on, let's book.
6898100 6899443 Hold your fire!
6925085 6927338 - Ready to rock?<br />- Ready.
6930841 6933469 Time to go. Now.
6933677 6936476 - Take this. They'll use gas.<br />- Come on.
6936680 6939650 Get started on the door.<br />Miles, hand me the detonator.

8769511 8771559 No, don't do it! Don't go!
