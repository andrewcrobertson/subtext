78328 84208 Three billion human lives ended<br />on August 29, 1997.
84292 86418 The survivors of the nuclear fire ...
86503 89213 called the war "Judgment Day."
89297 92382 They lived only to face<br />a new nightmare -
92467 94510 the war against the machines.
172672 176425 The computer which controlled<br />the machines, Skynet ...
176509 179511 sent two Terminators<br />back through time.
179596 183640 Their mission: to destroy the leader<br />of the human resistance.
183725 186560 John Connor, my son.
190607 194860 The first Terminator was programmed<br />to strike at me in the year 1984 ...
194944 197279 before John was born.
197363 199198 It failed.
199282 202117 The second was set to strike<br />at John himself ...
202202 204661 when he was still a child.
207916 212085 As before, the resistance was able<br />to send a lone warrior ...
212170 214463 a protector for John.
214547 217966 It was just a question of which one<br />of them would reach him first.
472722 476099 I need your clothes, your boots<br />and your motorcycle.
484609 487068 You forgot to say please.
503419 505128 Get him off me!
525983 527234 Pull it out!
548130 549965 Take it.
575783 578410 Can't let you take<br />the man's wheels, son.
578494 581997 Now, get off<br />before I put you down.
590881 593300 That's it, goddamn it.
653611 656112 R-31 David, Sherman Code 6 ...
656197 660909 at the Sixth Street Bridge and Santa Fe<br />on electrical disturbance.
660993 663244 Ten-four, R-31 David.
760301 763094 John, get in there and clean up<br />that pigsty of yours.
774648 777066 Your foster parents<br />are kind of dicks, huh?
777151 780236 I swear, I have had it<br />with that goddamn kid.
780321 782947 - He won't even answer me anymore.<br />- Honey, move.
783032 785950 Would you get off your butt<br />and help me?
786035 788870 - Todd!<br />- What?
788954 792290 He hasn't cleaned that room of his<br />in a month.
792374 795543 Oh, it's an emergency.<br />Hang on. I'll get right on it.
802593 804469 Come on.
805304 808598 Get your ass inside.<br />Do what your mother tells you.
809600 812560 She's not my mother, Todd.
838754 840755 This next patient is interesting.
840840 843299 I've been following the case<br />for years.
843384 845468 A 29-year-old female ...
847805 850473 diagnosed as acute<br />schizo-affective disorder.
850558 853810 The usual indicators: depression,<br />anxiety, violent acting out ...
853894 855603 delusions of persecution.
862027 865405 The delusional architecture<br />is fairly unique.
865489 868324 She believes that a machine<br />called the Terminator ...
868409 871744 which looks human,<br />was sent back through time ...
871829 873872 - to kill her.<br />- That's original.
873956 877208 And also that the father<br />of her child ...
877293 880545 was a soldier sent back<br />to protect her.
880629 882547 He was from the future too.
882631 887260 The year 2029,<br />if I remember correctly.
887344 889596 And here we are.
890347 891472 Morning, Sarah.
895811 899772 Good morning, Dr. Silberman.<br />How's the knee?
901609 903526 Fine, Sarah.
904653 906905 She stabbed me in the kneecap ...
906989 910533 with my pen a few weeks ago.
910618 912118 Repeated escape attempts.
922421 924631 Let's move on, shall we?
924715 928051 I don't like to see the patients<br />disrupting their rooms like this.
928135 931512 - See she takes her Thorazine.<br />- Sure. I'll take care of it.
944234 947320 It's time to take your meds, Connor.
947404 949155 You take it.
949239 952575 Now you know you gotta be good.<br />You're up for review this afternoon.
952660 954577 I'm not taking it, Dougie.
954662 957705 - I don't want any trouble.<br />- Ain't no trouble.
963754 965046 Zap her.
975641 977642 Last call, sugar.
983649 985650 Sweet dreams.
1015264 1017265 Are you the legal guardian<br />of John Connor?
1017558 1021018 That's right, Officer.<br />What's he done now?
1021103 1024063 - Could I speak with him, please?<br />- You could if he were here.
1024148 1027024 He took off on his bike this morning.<br />He could be anywhere.
1027109 1029402 Do you have a photograph of John?
1029486 1030737 Yeah. Hold on.
1033282 1035908 Gonna tell me what this is about?
1035993 1038578 I just need to ask him<br />a few questions.
1039747 1043541 He's a good-looking boy.<br />Do you mind if I keep this picture?
1043625 1047128 No, go on. There was a guy here<br />this morning looking for him too.
1047212 1049380 Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
1049465 1051924 Has that got something<br />to do with this?
1055262 1058347 I wouldn't worry about him.
1058432 1061225 Thanks for your cooperation.
1062269 1065271 Please insert your stolen card now.
1072529 1074280 PIN number.
1075491 1077074 Hurry up. This is taking too long.
1077159 1078659 Go, baby.
1080245 1081704 All right.
1081789 1085500 - PIN number 9003.<br />- Where'd you learn this stuff from?
1085584 1088085 From my mom.<br />My real mom, I mean.
1088170 1092423 Withdraw 300 bucks.
1092508 1095259 Come on, baby. Come on!
1095344 1097595 - Yes!<br />- Hey, it worked.
1097679 1101349 All right. Easy money.<br />Come on!
1103852 1105978 Yes! Piece of cake.
1111235 1114362 - Is that her?<br />- Yes.
1114446 1116280 She's pretty cool, huh?
1116365 1118616 No, she's a complete psycho.
1118700 1121452 That's why she's at Pescadero.<br />It's a mental institute.
1123205 1126207 She tried to blow up a computer factory<br />but got shot and arrested.
1126291 1128376 No shit.
1129086 1131462 She's a total loser.
1131547 1134298 Come on.<br />Let's go spend some money.
1163078 1165288 Sarah, wake up.
1172379 1174088 Kyle.
1176842 1178134 You're dead.
1178218 1180261 Where's our son, Sarah?
1181263 1183514 They took him away from me.
1183599 1186809 - He's the target now.<br />- I know.
1186894 1188936 He's all alone.<br />You have to protect him.
1189021 1191480 I know.
1191565 1194150 You tell me<br />how I'm supposed to do that.
1194234 1196360 He doesn't even believe me anymore.
1196445 1200489 - I've lost him.<br />- You're strong, Sarah.
1200574 1202992 Stronger than you ever thought<br />you could be.
1204036 1205453 On your feet, soldier!
1207581 1210374 I love you, Sarah.<br />I always will.
1212669 1215588 - I need you.<br />- I'll always be with you.
1219468 1222970 Remember the message?
1223055 1224847 The future is not set.
1226016 1229602 There is no fate<br />but what we make for ourselves.
1249581 1251499 Stay with me.
1252459 1255336 There's not much time left<br />in the world, Sarah.
1262511 1264637 Kyle, don't go!
1350307 1354268 It's like a giant strobe light ...
1354352 1356687 burning right through my eyes.
1360692 1363194 Somehow I can still see.
1369076 1370993 Oh, God.
1374331 1377792 We know the dream's the same<br />every night.
1377876 1381295 - Why do I have to --<br />- Please continue.
1384966 1387718 Children look like burnt paper.
1389346 1391472 Black.
1391556 1393474 Not moving.
1395310 1397728 And then the blast wave hits them.
1407030 1409740 And they fly apart like leaves.
1411493 1414870 Dreams of cataclysm,<br />the end of the world ...
1414955 1416872 are very common.
1418583 1422837 It's not a dream, you moron.<br />It's real.
1422921 1426841 - I know the date it happens.<br />- I'm sure it feels real to you.
1426925 1429426 On August 29, 1997 ...
1429511 1433013 it's gonna feel<br />pretty fuckin' real to you too!
1433098 1436767 Anybody not wearing two-million<br />sunblock is gonna have a real bad day.
1436852 1438769 Get it?
1438854 1441730 God, you think<br />you're safe and alive.
1441815 1444108 You're already dead. Everybody!
1444192 1446694 Him. You. You're dead already.
1446778 1449655 This whole place,<br />everything you see is gone!
1449739 1453826 You're the one living in the dream,<br />'cause I know it happens!
1453910 1455870 It happens!
1466840 1469842 I feel much better now.
1469926 1471802 Clearer.
1471887 1474680 Yes, your attitude has been ...
1474764 1477057 much improved lately.
1486401 1488903 It's helped me to have a goal ...
1488987 1492156 something to look forward to.
1492240 1493407 What is that?
1493491 1495826 Well, you said ...
1495911 1499747 that if I showed improvement<br />after six months ...
1499831 1502499 you would transfer me<br />to the minimum security wing ...
1502584 1505336 and I could have visitors.
1506963 1511008 Well, it's been six months and ...
1512135 1514428 I was looking forward<br />to seeing my son.
1515472 1516931 I see.
1520185 1524355 Let's go back to what you were saying<br />about those Terminator machines.
1525523 1528901 Now you think they don't exist?
1528985 1533113 They don't exist.<br />I know that now.
1533198 1536367 But you've told me on many occasions<br />about how you crushed one ...
1536451 1538535 in a hydraulic press.
1539913 1543040 If I had, there would have<br />been some evidence.
1543124 1545542 They would have found something<br />at the factory.
1545627 1547711 I see.
1547796 1551215 So you don't believe anymore<br />that the company covered it up?
1553510 1556387 No. Why would they?
1556596 1559723 Let's try a new position<br />right there.
1569651 1571151 Mr. Dyson?
1573029 1575656 The materials team<br />is running another-
1575740 1577408 - Mr. Dyson.<br />- Yes?
1577492 1580452 The materials team is running<br />another series this afternoon.
1580537 1583497 You have to sign for the -- it.
1583581 1586417 - You have to sign it out.<br />- Okay. I'll get it.
1589379 1592423 I know I haven't been here long,<br />but I was wondering if you know -
1592507 1593882 Know what?
1593967 1596593 If you know where "it" came from.
1596678 1600097 I asked them the same question once.<br />You know what they told me?
1600181 1602141 Don't ask.
1608064 1611108 - Good morning, Mr. Dyson.<br />- How's it going?
1611192 1614111 Insert key. Left on three.
1614195 1616530 Two, one, turn.
1619617 1622870 - How are the wife and kids?<br />- Great. Thanks.
1650065 1653108 So what do you think, Doctor?
1653985 1655944 Haven't I shown improvement?
1657197 1659990 Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
1661076 1663494 I know how smart you are.
1663578 1665621 You're just telling me<br />what I want to hear.
1666664 1669708 I don't think you really believe<br />what you're telling me today.
1669793 1673712 If I put you in minimum security,<br />you'll just try to escape again.
1678551 1680844 You have to let me see my son.
1682097 1683680 Please.
1687644 1690854 He's in great danger.<br />He's naked without me.
1692273 1693732 If I could make a phone call --
1693817 1696276 I'm afraid not.<br />Not for a while.
1698488 1700948 I don't see any choice but to<br />recommend to the review board ...
1701032 1703617 that you stay here<br />for another six months.
1706788 1710082 I'll kill you,<br />you son of a bitch!
1711126 1713794 You son of a bitch!
1714587 1718424 Ten CCs of sodium amobarbital, stat!
1718508 1721427 - You don't know what you're doing!<br />- Get some restraints in here now!
1723388 1726974 You don't know what you're doing!
1730812 1733105 Model citizen.
1772145 1774855 You just missed him.<br />He was here 15 minutes ago.
1774939 1778108 - He was going to the galleria.<br />- Yeah.
1778193 1779985 The galleria?
1825198 1828408 I'm gonna get some quarters.<br />I'll be back, all right?
1843299 1846134 - Oh, no!<br />- Girls, do you know John Connor?
1849889 1852641 Hey, do you know this guy?
1852725 1854893 Nah, I don't know him.
1860233 1862609 - John.<br />- Not now.
1862694 1865946 There's this cop scoping for you.<br />Check it out.
1868491 1870409 - He's right over there.<br />- Split, man.
1870493 1872953 - Just go.<br />- Yeah.
1877667 1878917 I saw that kid --
1894267 1896184 You're not supposed to<br />be in here!
1921919 1923128 Get down.
1993908 1996076 Mister, are you all right?
1997245 1998412 You all right?
2013720 2014928 Come on!
2054802 2056261 Goddamn!
2335374 2338084 Okay, time-out.<br />Stop the bike.
2338169 2340754 Time-out.<br />Come on, stop the bike.
2353851 2356561 Holy shit.<br />Now, don't take this the wrong way.
2356645 2359022 - You are a Terminator, right?<br />- Yes.
2359106 2361941 Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.
2373537 2375455 Holy shit.
2376957 2379542 You're really real.
2379627 2381586 I mean --
2384090 2387050 You're like a machine underneath,<br />right?
2387134 2388635 But alive outside?
2388719 2390637 I'm a cybernetic organism.
2390721 2393431 Living tissue<br />over metal endoskeleton.
2408239 2410406 This is intense.
2410491 2413284 Get a grip, John. Okay.
2415871 2417997 You're not here to kill me.
2418082 2422043 I figured that part out for myself.<br />So what's the deal?
2422128 2427549 - My mission is to protect you.<br />- Yeah? Who sent you?
2428759 2430885 You did.<br />Thirty-five years from now ...
2430970 2434973 you reprogrammed me to be<br />your protector here in this time.
2435057 2437809 Oh, this is deep.
2460249 2463251 So this other guy,<br />he's a Terminator like you, right?
2463544 2467046 Not like me.<br />A T-1000, advanced prototype.
2468674 2470466 More advanced than you are?
2470551 2475054 - Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.<br />- What the hell does that mean?
2475139 2479392 - Liquid metal.<br />- Where are we going?
2479476 2482812 We have to get out of the city<br />immediately and avoid the authorities.
2482897 2485607 I gotta stop by my house.<br />I wanna pick up some stuff.
2485691 2490486 Negative. The T-1000 would definitely<br />try to reacquire you there.
2490571 2493323 - You sure?<br />- I would.
2503918 2506586 Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks ...
2508881 2510340 but I gotta warn 'em.
2510424 2512800 Shit. You got a quarter?
2521560 2524562 - Hello.<br />- Janelle, it's me.
2524647 2527023 - John?<br />- Is everything all right?
2527107 2529525 - Are you guys okay?<br />- Sure, honey, everything's okay.
2529610 2532695 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm fine.
2532780 2536366 John, it's late.<br />I was beginning to worry about you.
2536450 2539160 If you hurry home, we can sit down<br />and have dinner together.
2539244 2540787 I'm making beef-stew.
2540871 2543790 Something's wrong.<br />She's never this nice.
2543874 2545667 Where are you?
2545751 2548628 What the hell is<br />the goddamn dog barking at?
2548712 2551965 Hey, shut up,<br />you worthless piece of shit!
2552049 2553508 The dog's really barking.
2553592 2555802 You were gonna tell the kid<br />to get rid of that mutt.
2559723 2562475 John, it's late.<br />Please don't make me worry.
2562559 2564268 Could he already be there?
2565396 2566688 Are you okay?
2566772 2570775 - I'm right here. I'm fine.<br />- Are you sure you're all right?
2570859 2574195 - What's the dog's name?<br />- Max.
2574279 2576614 Hey, Janelle.<br />What's wrong with Wolfie?
2576699 2579283 I can hear him barking.<br />Is he okay?
2579368 2583246 Wolfie's fine, honey.<br />Wolfie's just fine.
2583330 2584998 Where are you?
2586583 2587667 Your foster parents are dead.
2625539 2627540 I need a minute here.
2627624 2631961 You're telling me that this thing<br />can imitate anything it touches?
2632046 2634964 Anything it samples<br />by physical contact.
2635049 2636466 Get real.
2636550 2640303 It could disguise itself<br />as a pack of cigarettes?
2640387 2642305 No, only an object<br />of equal size.
2642389 2644766 Why not just become a bomb<br />or something to get me?
2645225 2647059 It can't form complex machines.
2647144 2649187 Guns and explosives<br />have chemicals, moving parts.
2649271 2652899 It doesn't work that way.<br />But it can form solid metal shapes.
2652983 2656027 - Like what?<br />- Knives and stabbing weapons.
2756128 2757587 Messages from Mom.
2772769 2775688 These were taken by<br />a video surveillance camera ...
2775772 2779317 at the West Highland Police Station<br />in 1984.
2780736 2782820 He killed 17 police officers<br />that night.
2785157 2787199 Men with families ...
2788785 2790202 children.
2791830 2794206 These were taken at a mall<br />in Reseda ...
2794291 2796500 today.
2797669 2800880 Miss Connor, we know you know<br />who this guy is.
2804301 2808054 I just sat here and told you<br />that your son is missing ...
2808138 2810973 that the foster parents<br />have been murdered.
2811058 2812808 We know this guy's involved.
2813852 2817188 Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br />Don't you care?
2822069 2825738 We're wasting our time.<br />Let's go.
2825822 2828366 Sorry, guys.
2828450 2832745 She's grown more disconnected<br />from reality as time goes on.
2832829 2835039 I'm afraid she can't help us now.
2835123 2838334 If she clears at all and can<br />give us anything, I'll call you.
2838418 2840044 Sure.
2840128 2843089 Douglas, take her back to her room.
2843173 2844340 Yes, sir.
2845884 2848010 Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
2848220 2850137 You see ...
2850222 2853432 we spent a lot of time in Nicaragua<br />and places like that.
2854685 2859021 For a while there, she was with<br />this crazy ex-Green Beret guy ...
2859106 2860481 running guns.
2860565 2863484 Then there were some other guys.
2863568 2865569 She'd shack up with anybody<br />she could learn from ...
2865654 2868906 so she could teach me how to be<br />this great military leader.
2870659 2872660 Then she gets busted.
2872744 2876372 It's like, "Sorry, kid, your mom's<br />a psycho. Didn't you know?"
2878583 2882503 Like everything I've been brought up<br />to believe is all made-up bullshit.
2882587 2884422 I hated her for that.
2888593 2891137 But everything she said was true.
2892431 2894390 She knew ...
2896560 2898644 and nobody believed her ...
2900397 2902314 not even me.
2904276 2906152 Listen. We gotta get her<br />out of there.
2906236 2909613 Negative. The T-1000's highest<br />probability for success now ...
2909698 2912742 will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait<br />for you to make contact with her.
2912826 2914910 Great. What happens to her?
2914995 2917872 Typically, the subject being copied<br />is terminated.
2917956 2921208 Shit! Why didn't you tell me?<br />We gotta go right now!
2921293 2923377 Negative.<br />It's not a mission priority.
2923462 2925629 Fuck you!<br />She's a priority to me!
2927466 2931469 Goddamn it!<br />What's your problem? Help!
2931553 2933345 This does not help our mission.
2933430 2935890 Get this psycho off of me!<br />Help!
2935974 2939018 I'm being kidnapped!<br />Get this psycho off of me!
2939102 2940144 Let me go!
2944691 2946484 Why did you do that?
2946568 2948486 Because you told me to.
2951323 2952740 What?
2957788 2959747 You have to do what I say?
2959831 2962041 That's one of my mission parameters.
2963335 2966462 Prove it.<br />Stand on one foot.
2969341 2970382 Yes!
2972594 2976180 Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
2977682 2978933 You okay, kid?
2979017 2980392 Take a hike, bozo.
2980477 2983062 Let's get outta here, man.
2983146 2985022 Fuck you, you little dipshit!
2985816 2987233 Dipshit?
2989402 2991529 Put your leg down.
2991613 2996450 - Did you call moi a dipshit?<br />- Just trying to help this punk.
2996535 2998869 Grab this guy.
3000038 3001664 Get him off of me!
3001748 3003833 Now who's the dipshit ...
3003917 3005709 you jock douche bag?
3014803 3017263 Put the gun down now!
3017347 3020558 - Get outta here!<br />- Come on. Let's split!
3027524 3029441 You were gonna kill that guy!
3029526 3031694 Of course. I'm a Terminator.
3033905 3036532 Listen to me very carefully, okay?
3036616 3039952 You're not a Terminator anymore,<br />all right?
3040036 3042454 You got that?
3042539 3044790 You just can't go around<br />killing people.
3044875 3045916 Why?
3046918 3049044 What do you mean, why?<br />'Cause you can't.
3050130 3052923 Because you just can't.<br />Trust me on this.
3058972 3062433 Look. I'm gonna go get my mom.
3062517 3065352 I order you to help me.
3212917 3215336 You have a Sarah Connor here?
3215420 3217087 You're runnin' kind of late.
3217172 3219548 They've been in there for an hour.
3219632 3222051 Hold on a second.<br />I'll buzz you in.
3223887 3227765 Oh, here come your friends now.
3289494 3292913 - Gwen, you want some coffee?<br />- No, thanks.
3292997 3296041 - How 'bout a beer?<br />- Yeah, right.
3319858 3323152 - Hey, I got a full house.<br />- That's good, Louis.
3323236 3325487 Must be my lucky day.
3468339 3470799 You're right about number 24.
3470883 3473885 Increase the medication<br />to 250 milligrams.
3473970 3476847 - Same kind?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3491571 3493989 You!
3496492 3498410 You broke my arm.
3498494 3501288 There are 215 bones<br />in the human body.
3501372 3503957 That's one. Now, don't move.
3509922 3511632 What are you going to do?
3515136 3517220 Why do we stop now?
3518514 3522309 You gotta promise me<br />you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
3522393 3524978 - Right.<br />- Swear?
3525063 3526563 What?
3526648 3529733 Just put up your hand and say,<br />"I swear I won't kill anyone."
3530860 3533654 I swear I will not kill anyone.
3533738 3534905 All right. Let's go.
3541913 3543914 Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00 ...
3543998 3546249 Monday through Friday.
3549962 3551171 What are you doing?
3551255 3553882 You son of a bitch!<br />You shot me!
3555677 3556968 Crazy bastard!
3561265 3563558 Don't shoot me again.<br />Don't kill me.
3567105 3569064 He'll live.
3583538 3585664 Son of a bitch!
3587166 3588458 Let's try to remain calm.
3588543 3590460 Open it, or he'll be dead<br />before he hits the floor.
3590545 3592587 There's no way, Connor.<br />Let him go.
3592672 3595215 - Open the door.<br />- It ain't gonna happen.
3595299 3597134 Take it easy, Sarah.
3597218 3600345 It won't work. You're no killer.<br />I don't believe you can do it.
3600430 3603390 You're already dead. Everybody dies.<br />You know I believe it.
3603474 3605517 So don't fuck with me!
3605601 3607310 Open the door!
3614152 3615777 Back off?
3615862 3617279 Get back!
3617363 3619322 I'll pump him full of this shit.<br />I swear!
3620658 3622701 Don't move!
3623870 3625036 Drop the shit!
3625121 3626997 Do it!
3627081 3628999 Get in the office.
3629083 3631126 On the floor, face down.<br />Not you!
3631210 3632878 Open the door.
3635757 3639176 On the floor. Hold it open.<br />Face the wall!
3655193 3657027 Get her!
3684722 3687724 Hurry up! Open the door!<br />The door's locked!
3688810 3690685 Let's go! Open it!
3693147 3695106 - She broke it off.<br />- Open it!
3700530 3702864 Let's go around! Come on!<br />Move it!
3735022 3736106 Mom, wait!
3742947 3743947 Come back here!
3748578 3750203 - Help her!<br />- Wait here.
3750288 3752873 - Hurry up!<br />- He'll kill us all!
3754166 3755417 Hold her.
3756961 3758128 He'll kill us all!
3780318 3782652 Mom, are you okay? Mom!
3787116 3789534 Come with me<br />if you want to live.
3789619 3792162 It's okay, Mom.<br />He's here to help.
3816854 3817896 Go.
3850262 3852764 What the fuck is it?<br />What the fuck is going on?
3867571 3869406 Get down.
3905359 3906901 Out of the car!
3908279 3909446 Right now!
3933929 3934971 Go!
3946233 3947442 I'm out.
3954241 3956159 - Come on.<br />- Here.
3958662 3960789 Reload.
3969715 3971674 Last one!
3978891 3980475 Hang on.
4006669 4008211 Ready!
4021934 4023852 Here, drive.
4077072 4079282 He's not back there.<br />There's nobody behind us.
4079366 4081451 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah.
4083787 4084954 Can you see anything?
4086123 4087457 I see everything.
4090336 4091961 Cool.
4095549 4097425 Come here.
4103224 4104974 I said I was okay.
4105768 4108937 John, it was stupid of you<br />to go there.
4109813 4112148 You have to be smarter<br />than that.
4112233 4113816 You were almost killed.
4114985 4116819 What were you thinking?
4117655 4120240 You cannot risk yourself,<br />even for me.
4120324 4123534 Do you understand?<br />You're too important.
4123619 4126287 Do you understand?
4129166 4130291 But ...
4132169 4135672 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
4136924 4139300 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
4146517 4148142 What's wrong with your eyes?
4150104 4151521 Nothing.
4161448 4163908 So, what's your story?
4174461 4175545 You okay?
4175629 4177046 Fine.
4178882 4182218 Say, that's a nice bike.
4204700 4206409 Watch it, lug nuts.
4213917 4217337 Listen, do you know<br />what you're doing?
4217421 4220214 I have detailed files<br />on human anatomy.
4221133 4223092 I bet.
4223177 4226179 Makes you a more efficient killer,<br />right?
4226263 4227388 Correct.
4233437 4235438 Does it hurt<br />when you get shot?
4236482 4239942 I sense injuries.<br />The data could be called "pain."
4242279 4244197 John, help me with the light.
4244281 4246574 - Will these heal up?<br />- Yes.
4246658 4250870 Good. If you can't pass for human,<br />you're not much good to us.
4250954 4253664 How long do you live?<br />I mean, last. Whatever.
4253749 4257043 A hundred and twenty years<br />with my existing power cell.
4257127 4260046 Can you learn stuff that you<br />haven't been programmed with ...
4260130 4261547 so you can be ...
4262800 4265510 you know, more human ...
4265594 4268304 and not such a dork<br />all the time?
4271475 4275019 My CPU is a neural net processor,<br />a learning computer.
4275104 4279440 But Skynet presets the switch<br />to read-only when we're sent out alone.
4280818 4283236 Doesn't want you to do<br />too much thinking, huh?
4283320 4284654 No.
4286198 4288491 Can we reset the switch?
4306510 4310972 Rotate the two locking cylinders<br />counter-clockwise.
4316854 4318354 Do it.
4326655 4328990 Now open the port cover.
4331535 4334078 Pull to break the seal.
4337207 4341210 Good, now remove<br />the shock-damping assembly.
4344756 4347925 You can now access the CPU.
4348010 4350386 - Do you see it?<br />- Yes.
4350471 4354390 Hold the CPU by its base tab.
4354475 4355892 Pull.
4393263 4394972 Do you see the pin switch?
4395057 4396933 No! No!
4397935 4400561 - Out of my way, John.<br />- Don't kill him.
4400646 4403940 It, John, not him.<br />It.
4404024 4407485 Okay, it.<br />But we need it.
4407569 4410196 Listen to me.<br />You listen.
4410280 4412406 We're better off on our own.
4412491 4414283 But he's the only proof we have ...
4414368 4416869 of the future and the war<br />and all that.
4416954 4418329 Maybe.
4420958 4423000 I don't trust it.
4423085 4424794 But he's my friend, all right?
4425629 4428381 You don't know what it's like<br />to try to kill one of these things ...
4428465 4432051 and if something goes wrong<br />this could be our last chance, so move!
4432135 4434220 If I'm ever supposed to be<br />this great military leader ...
4434304 4438140 maybe you should start listening<br />to my leadership ideas once in a while.
4441144 4445773 Because if my own mother won't,<br />how do you expect anyone else to?
4459997 4463040 All right, play it your way.
4470507 4472550 Was there a problem?
4472634 4474135 No problem.
4475846 4477054 None whatsoever.
4510714 4512631 Are we learning yet?
4525062 4528022 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
4531735 4533361 Just head south.
4542120 4543704 Keep it under 65.
4543789 4546791 - We don't want to be pulled over.<br />- Affirmative.
4550003 4552505 You gotta listen to the way<br />people talk.
4552589 4556092 You don't say "affirmative"<br />or some shit like that.
4556176 4558511 You say, "No problemo."
4558595 4562515 If someone comes off to you<br />with an attitude, you say, "Eat me."
4562599 4566894 And if you want to shine them on,<br />it's "Hasta la vista, baby."
4570107 4572233 Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."
4572317 4575361 If someone gets upset,<br />you say, "Chill out."
4575445 4576821 Or you can do combinations.
4577614 4579907 Chill out, dick-wad.
4580742 4582743 That's great.<br />See? You're getting it.
4594965 4596841 You got any cash?
4596925 4600469 I got a couple hundred bucks.<br />I'll give you half.
4600554 4602221 Mom!
4603390 4605391 Get some food.
4607394 4609812 No sense of humor.
4615235 4618821 That's another thing.<br />You can lighten up a bit yourself.
4619739 4621907 This severe routine<br />is getting old, okay.
4621992 4623826 I mean, you're acting<br />like such a geek.
4623910 4625911 Smile once in a while.
4625996 4627329 Smile?
4627414 4631333 Yeah, you know, smile.<br />Watch.
4632335 4636046 Hi. Nice place you got here.<br />How's business?
4637007 4638841 Give me a break.
4639759 4641760 Okay, bad example.
4642888 4644555 See that guy over there?
4644639 4646515 That's a smile.
4665869 4667328 That's good.
4667412 4670372 Maybe you could practice<br />in front of a mirror or something.
4677631 4679548 Want some of my fries?
4689559 4692019 - Need any help?<br />- No.
4693438 4695189 - I got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4703532 4706534 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4708578 4709787 People, I mean.
4712958 4714792 It's in your nature<br />to destroy yourselves.
4715877 4718796 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4718880 4722132 Break it up before I wring<br />both of your necks.
4723927 4727012 I need to know<br />how Skynet gets built.
4727097 4728347 Who's responsible?
4728431 4731976 The man most directly responsible<br />is Miles Bennett Dyson.
4732060 4733769 Who is that?
4733853 4737773 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
4740569 4742319 Why him?
4742404 4745781 In a few months, he creates<br />a revolutionary type of microprocessor.
4746825 4748158 Go on. Then what?
4749286 4752204 In three years Cyberdyne will become<br />the largest supplier ...
4752289 4753664 of military computer systems.
4754749 4757668 All Stealth bombers are upgraded<br />with Cyberdyne computers ...
4757752 4759211 becoming fully unmanned.
4759296 4762339 Afterwards they fly with<br />a perfect operational record.
4762424 4765050 The Skynet funding bill is passed.
4765135 4768429 The system goes on-line<br />on August 4, 1997.
4768513 4771682 Human decisions are removed<br />from strategic defense.
4771766 4774476 Skynet begins to learn<br />at a geometric rate.
4774561 4778856 It becomes self-aware<br />at 2:14 a.m. Eastern time, August 29.
4779941 4782526 In a panic,<br />they try to pull the plug.
4783653 4785904 - Skynet fights back.<br />- Yes.
4785989 4788741 It launches its missiles<br />against the targets in Russia.
4788825 4791869 Why attack Russia?<br />Aren't they our friends now?
4791953 4796332 Skynet knows the Russian counterattack<br />will eliminate its enemies over here.
4796416 4798500 Jesus.
4800670 4802504 How much do you know<br />about Dyson?
4804758 4806675 I have detailed files.
4807886 4809845 I want to know everything.
4811056 4815142 What he looks like,<br />where he lives, everything.
4826780 4832576 Miles.
4850470 4852221 Are you going to work all day?
4852305 4856183 I'm sorry, baby.<br />But this thing is just kicking my ass.
4856267 4857559 Miles, it's Sunday.
4857644 4860396 You promised to take the kids<br />to Raging Waters today.
4861981 4863482 I can't ...
4864150 4865859 I'm on a roll.
4878707 4880916 Baby, this is going<br />to blow them all away.
4881000 4884086 - It's a neural net processor.<br />- I know. You told me.
4884170 4887339 It's a neural net processor.<br />It thinks and learns like we do.
4887424 4890092 It's superconducting<br />at room temperature.
4890176 4894430 Other computers are just<br />pocket calculators by comparison.
4896349 4898600 But why is that<br />so goddamn important, Miles?
4898685 4900018 I really need to know ...
4900103 4903188 because sometimes I feel<br />like I'm going crazy here.
4904858 4906859 Baby, I am this close.
4907944 4908986 Come here.
4911614 4914116 Imagine a jet airliner ...
4914200 4916869 with a pilot that never gets tired,<br />never makes mistakes ...
4916953 4918829 never shows up to work<br />with a hangover.
4921207 4923625 Meet the pilot.
4923710 4926795 Why did we get married, Miles?<br />Why did we have these children?
4926880 4927921 You don't need us.
4928006 4931425 Your heart and your mind<br />are in here.
4931509 4934386 But it doesn't love you<br />like we do.
4942562 4945189 I'm sorry. Really.
4945273 4949526 How about spending some time<br />with your other babies?
4952197 4954031 Raging Waters!
4983686 4985646 Wait in the car.
5023852 5025686 You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
5046457 5048208 Hey, big John.
5048835 5049960 What's up?
5051296 5053547 He's cool, Enrique.<br />He's with me.
5053631 5056800 He's ... Uncle Bob.
5056885 5059094 Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
5059178 5060929 Uncle Bob, huh?
5062015 5063265 Okay.
5070273 5071315 Drink?
5076654 5078071 "Uncle Bob"?
5080074 5082868 You're pretty famous,<br />all over the goddamn TV.
5082952 5085621 Pictures of you, John,<br />your big friend here.
5085705 5087664 Cops are going nuts<br />looking for you.
5091586 5095547 I just came for my stuff.<br />I need clothes, food and a truck.
5095632 5097674 How about the fillings in my teeth?
5097759 5099927 Now, Enrique.
5101262 5103472 You two,<br />you're on weapons detail.
5103556 5105223 Let's go.
5125828 5127746 One thing about my mom --
5130041 5132000 she always plans ahead.
5142679 5143887 Excellent.
5154524 5158193 This is my best truck,<br />but the starter motor's gone.
5158277 5160195 You got time to change it out?
5160279 5163615 Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark<br />to cross the border.
5163700 5165200 Enrique.
5165284 5168912 It's dangerous for you here.<br />You get out tonight too, okay?
5168996 5171456 Sure.
5171541 5175335 Just drop by anytime<br />and totally fuck up my life, all right?
5179757 5183218 See, I grew up in places like this ...
5183302 5185721 so I just thought<br />that's how people lived --
5187056 5189766 riding around in helicopters ...
5190852 5193061 learning how to blow shit up.
5194564 5197232 But then when my mom got busted ...
5197316 5199693 I got put into a regular school.
5200361 5203113 All the other kids<br />were into Nintendo.
5217378 5219504 Are you ever afraid?
5219589 5220881 No.
5224761 5226553 Not even of dying?
5227096 5229055 No.
5233394 5237647 You don't feel any emotion about it,<br />one way or another?
5237732 5241693 No. I have to stay functional<br />until my mission is complete.
5246699 5249826 Then it doesn't matter.
5249911 5253622 I have to stay functional too.<br />"I'm too important."
5269889 5271765 That's definitely you.
5282318 5285779 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung around with were geeks ...
5286155 5289658 but there was this one guy,<br />he was kinda cool.
5289742 5291660 He taught me engines.
5291744 5293912 Hold here.
5293996 5296414 Mom screwed it up, of course.
5296499 5298917 She'd always tell 'em<br />about Judgment Day ...
5299001 5301795 and me being this world leader.
5301879 5303839 That'd be all she wrote.
5305174 5306299 Torque wrench, please.
5309846 5313056 I wish I could've met<br />my real dad.
5313140 5314891 You will.
5314976 5317143 Yeah, I guess.
5317228 5321064 When I'm, like, 45, I think.
5321148 5324860 They sent him back through time<br />to 1984.
5324944 5326361 Man.
5327905 5330365 He hasn't even been born yet.
5332159 5334077 It messes with your head.
5336831 5339749 - The other bolt.<br />- Oh. Here.
5346090 5349634 Mom and him were only together<br />for one night.
5349719 5352178 She still loves him, I guess.
5352263 5355140 I see her crying sometimes.
5355224 5359227 She denies it totally, of course,<br />like she got something stuck in her eye.
5364191 5365734 Why do you cry?
5366819 5368320 - You mean people?<br />- Yeah.
5368404 5369779 I don't know.
5369864 5371948 We just cry ...
5372033 5374576 you know, when it hurts.
5380666 5382417 Pain causes it?
5383502 5385629 No. It's different.
5385713 5389007 It's when there's nothing wrong<br />with you, but you hurt anyway.
5389091 5390675 - You get it?<br />- No.
5391928 5393637 All right, my man!
5395473 5397098 Give me five.
5399143 5401269 Just put out your hand<br />like this.
5402605 5406942 All right! Now hit me.<br />Give me five. Do the same thing.
5411656 5414115 Okay, that's good.<br />Up high.
5415117 5416368 Five low.
5416452 5418119 Too slow.
5421123 5423375 I'm just kidding.<br />One more time.
5423459 5425669 Good. Now try it.
5425753 5427712 Now do me.<br />Give me five.
5429173 5433718 Watching John with the machine,<br />it was suddenly so clear.
5433803 5436721 The Terminator would never stop.
5436806 5440767 It would never leave him,<br />never hurt him ...
5440851 5444270 never shout at him<br />or get drunk and hit him ...
5444355 5446940 or be too busy<br />to spend time with him.
5447817 5449901 It would always be there ...
5449986 5452654 and it would die<br />to protect him.
5454073 5457409 Of all the would-be fathers<br />who came and went over the years ...
5457493 5459536 this thing, this machine ...
5459620 5461997 was the only one<br />who measured up.
5462748 5464582 In an insane world ...
5464667 5466626 it was the sanest choice.
5564391 5566351 Hey, let's try this one.
5571982 5574150 There we go.
5680257 5682759 She said go south with him<br />like you planned.
5682843 5685053 - She'll meet you tomorrow.<br />- Mom!
5686847 5688014 Mom, wait!
5703280 5704739 "No fate."
5705950 5708409 No fate but what we make.
5710537 5712538 My father told her this.
5715084 5719379 I made him memorize it in the future<br />as a message to her.
5721048 5722966 Never mind.
5723050 5726386 Okay, the whole thing goes-
5726470 5729180 The future's not set.
5729265 5732767 There's no fate but what<br />we make for ourselves.
5732851 5735853 She intends to change the future.
5735938 5737397 Yeah, I guess.
5738941 5740775 Oh, shit!
5740859 5742777 - Dyson.<br />- Yeah.
5742861 5746364 Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
5746448 5748449 She's gonna blow him away.
5748534 5750618 Come on! Let's go!
5763007 5765049 This is tactically dangerous.
5765134 5766259 Drive faster.
5766343 5768845 The T-1000 has the same files<br />that I do.
5768929 5772348 It knows what I know.<br />It might anticipate this move.
5772433 5774934 I don't care.<br />We gotta stop her.
5775019 5776936 Killing Dyson<br />might prevent the war.
5777021 5780523 I don't care!<br />Haven't you learned anything yet?
5780607 5783693 Haven't you figured out<br />why you can't kill people?
5786572 5789073 Look, maybe you don't care<br />if you live or die ...
5789158 5791326 but everybody's not like that.
5791410 5794996 We have feelings.<br />We hurt. We're afraid.
5797499 5801169 You got to learn this stuff.<br />I'm not kidding. It's important.
5838832 5841459 Danny, I told you to go to bed,<br />like your sister.
5841543 5844921 Just a couple of minutes, Mom!
5861063 5863398 Danny, your time is up!
5863482 5866401 Come brush your teeth<br />and get to bed.
5908193 5909527 Daddy!
5909611 5912113 Danny, go! Go!
5920080 5922498 - Tarissa, run!<br />- Oh, my God!
5929590 5931632 Just take Danny and run!
5931717 5932967 Run!
5933051 5934802 Oh, Jesus! Miles!
5953697 5954697 Daddy!
5956408 5957867 Nobody fucking move!
5958702 5959952 Don't hurt my daddy!
5960037 5961579 On the floor, bitch.
5961663 5963831 Get down now!
5964708 5965791 Get out of the way!
5965876 5967335 Don't hurt him!
5968837 5970838 Get on the floor now!
5973884 5975593 Just let the boy go.
5975677 5977261 Shut up. Shut up.
5977346 5978638 Shut up!
5978722 5981307 It's all your fault, motherfucker.
5981391 5983643 - It's all your fault!<br />- What?
5983727 5985853 I'm not gonna let you do it.
6037864 6039949 Shit! We're too late!
6044454 6045580 Check them.
6049251 6051252 Look at me, Mom.
6051336 6053546 Are you hurt?
6057175 6059260 I almost --
6070897 6073232 It'll be okay.
6073317 6075276 We'll figure something out.<br />Okay?
6076862 6078487 I promise.
6081783 6084744 You came here to stop me.
6085621 6087580 Yeah, I did.
6090459 6092460 I love you, John.
6094129 6095713 I always have.
6097633 6099050 I know.
6106058 6108267 Deep penetration.
6109853 6111771 No shattered bone.
6111855 6114815 Hold here.<br />The pressure should stop the bleeding.
6125577 6126994 Who are you people?
6127954 6129372 Show him.
6132042 6136212 Danny, I want you to come with me<br />right now. Show me your room.
6176712 6177920 Oh, my God.
6178004 6180673 Now listen to me<br />very carefully.
6186555 6190683 Dyson listened while the Terminator<br />laid it all down.
6190767 6194645 Skynet. Judgment Day.
6194730 6197022 The history of things to come.
6198442 6201193 It's not every day that<br />you find out you're responsible ...
6201278 6204113 for three billion deaths.
6204197 6206115 He took it pretty well.
6208118 6210578 I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
6216585 6218711 You're judging me ...
6218795 6221255 on things I haven't even done yet.
6225469 6227595 How were we supposed to know?
6230056 6232016 Yeah.
6232100 6234477 Right.
6234561 6236687 How were you supposed to know?
6237731 6241442 Fucking men like you<br />built the hydrogen bomb.
6241526 6244111 Men like you ...
6244196 6245613 thought it up.
6249493 6251452 You think you're so creative.
6252871 6255956 You don't know what it's like<br />to really create something ...
6256041 6258167 to create a life ...
6258251 6259794 to feel it growing inside you.
6259878 6262797 All you know how to create<br />is death and destruction.
6262881 6264548 Mom!
6264633 6268385 We need to be a little more<br />constructive here. Okay?
6268470 6270554 We still have to stop this<br />from happening, don't we?
6270639 6273474 But I thought --
6273558 6277561 Aren't we changing things right now,<br />changing the way it goes?
6277646 6282441 That's right. There's no way I'm going<br />to finish the new processor. Not now.
6282526 6285986 Forget it. I'm out of it.<br />I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.
6286071 6287947 That's not good enough.
6288031 6289949 No one must follow your work.
6290033 6291909 Right.
6291993 6296330 All right, then we have to destroy<br />all the stuff at the lab --
6296414 6297998 the files, the disk drives ...
6298083 6300709 everything here.
6300794 6302878 Everything.
6302963 6304880 I don't care.
6306174 6307174 The chip.
6307259 6309343 - Do you know about the chip?<br />- What chip?
6309427 6311846 It's at Cyberdyne.<br />It's from the other one like you.
6311930 6314640 The CPU from the first Terminator.
6314724 6317101 Son of a bitch!<br />I knew it!
6317185 6319895 They told us not to ask<br />where they got it.
6319980 6322314 Those lying motherfuckers.
6322399 6324191 It's scary stuff.<br />Radically advanced.
6324276 6325401 It was smashed.
6325485 6329113 It didn't work, but it gave us ideas,<br />took us in new directions.
6329197 6331198 Things we would've never-
6333368 6335452 All my work was based on it.
6335537 6337371 It must be destroyed.
6339624 6342626 Can you get us in?<br />Past security?
6342711 6344795 I think so, yeah. When?
6349718 6350718 Now?
6354639 6357683 The future,<br />always so clear to me ...
6357767 6360769 had become like<br />a black highway at night.
6360854 6363564 We were in<br />uncharted territory now ...
6363648 6366567 making up history<br />as we went along.
6404898 6406815 Carl, right?
6408151 6411570 Friends from out of town.<br />I just thought I'd ...
6411655 6413656 take 'em upstairs<br />and show 'em around.
6413740 6417034 Mr. Dyson, you know the rules<br />concerning visitors in the lab.
6417118 6419286 I need written authorization --
6420330 6422331 I insist.
6422415 6424166 Don't even think about it.
6435136 6436595 It's okay.
6438014 6441141 It takes two keys, turned<br />simultaneously, to open the vault.
6441226 6444144 The other one is in a locker<br />at the security station.
6445480 6446939 Gibbons?
6449985 6451819 Gibbons! Come on, man!
6451903 6454989 You can't leave the desk<br />like that!
6459828 6461328 Oh, shit.
6478888 6480889 My card should access this.
6485562 6487980 - What is it?<br />- Damn it.
6488064 6490024 The silent alarm's been tripped.
6496197 6498949 It's neutralized all the codes<br />in the entire building.
6499034 6500951 Nothing will open anywhere now.
6502037 6503871 We have to abort.
6507083 6510502 We go all the way.<br />Okay?
6512630 6516425 You guys get started on the lab.<br />I can open this.
6516509 6518969 - I think it's that guy from the mall.<br />- It is.
6519054 6520971 It's him and the woman.
6522557 6525726 Just send everything<br />you got in the area right now.
6527937 6531398 I have a personal entry code<br />for the lab. It may still work.
6535904 6536945 It's no good.
6537030 6538572 Let me try mine.
6543536 6545621 John, fire in the hole!
6557675 6562471 Wait! You can't go in there.<br />The fire set off the Halon system.
6569646 6572106 You have to wait<br />until the gas clears.
6574609 6575901 Put this on.
6589874 6592376 All right, let's get to work.

6662906 6664698 Excuse me.

6684594 6686637 One-Mary-23,<br />give me that location again.
6686721 6688472 2111 Kramer.
6688556 6691683 Suspects are armed and<br />considered extremely dangerous.
6743945 6745737 All right.
6745822 6747614 7-2-5-6.
6754455 6755789 Easy money.
6764882 6767300 Oh, shit. Not good.
6772390 6774016 How we doing?
6774100 6775767 Primer cord is set.
6775852 6778311 One more barrel,<br />two more minutes.
6782191 6785110 - How do we set them off?<br />- Remote control.

6787655 6789197 - We got company.<br />- Police?

6819562 6821188 You at the window!
6821272 6824733 Drop your weapon and place<br />your hands on top of your head!

6923833 6926168 One, two, three, go.
6938306 6941141 In order to get that out --
6947940 6950692 We got Skynet by the balls now.
6950776 6952485 Come on, let's book.
6953404 6955322 Hold your fire!
6980514 6983016 - Ready to rock?<br />- Ready.
6985770 6987062 Time to go.
6987146 6988605 Now.
6988689 6992234 - Take this. They'll use gas.<br />- Come on.
6992318 6995403 Get started on the door.<br />Miles, hand me the detonator.
7019679 7022430 Mom! Mom!
7066809 7067934 Shit!
7069353 7072272 She's in the clean room.<br />There's no way outta there.
7081782 7082782 Get down!
7090291 7091708 Here.
7117234 7120653 I don't know how much longer<br />I can hold this.
7124825 7126326 Fall back!
7126410 7127994 Everybody out!
7128079 7129996 Fall back now!<br />Go! Go! Go!

7199275 7200984 Shut your eyes.

7218586 7220920 Get down on the floor!<br />Face down!

7595295 7596921 Take the shotgun.
7600175 7601759 Are you hurt?
7614940 7617859 Holy shit.<br />Come on, Mom. Come on!

7646263 7649015 - I'm bleeding bad.<br />- Keep pressure on it.
7650684 7652351 Here. This'll work.
7657941 7659650 He's gaining.
7662195 7663863 Step on it!
7663947 7666741 - This is the vehicle's top speed.<br />- I can run faster than this!
7677586 7679045 Coming up, to the right.
7681089 7683049 Watch it! Watch it!
7705614 7707740 - Drive.<br />- Where are you going?
7715207 7717124 Take the off-ramp.
7726802 7727969 Shit!

8090665 8092916 - Go. Run.<br />- No! We gotta stick together.
8093001 8095002 John, you've got to go now.
8095086 8097254 - John!<br />- Go! Now!
8171704 8173497 Get up the steps.
8180880 8182381 Get up.
8183174 8185342 Come on, Mom.<br />I got you.
8219752 8222087 Grab the chain. Grab it.
8223465 8226216 Grab it. Go. Go!
8236561 8239897 Mom, come on! Mom!
8289030 8290822 Call to John.
8293618 8295494 I know this hurts.
8297288 8298956 Call John.
8315348 8318016 Call to John now.
8320019 8321895 Fuck you.
8519427 8520886 Help!
8541532 8543116 Mom.
8548331 8550707 - Help me.<br />- Get out of the way, John.
8551667 8553919 - John! John!<br />- Shoot!
8609934 8612352 Get down!
8705655 8707822 Get up. Come on.
8710076 8711868 Holy shit.
8711953 8714412 I need a vacation.
8727635 8730428 Is it dead?
8730513 8731930 Terminated.
8735434 8737102 Will this melt in there?
8740064 8741940 Yes. Throw it in.
8749031 8750949 And the chip.
8766132 8767757 It's over.
8774598 8776266 There's one more chip.
8780938 8783189 And it must be destroyed also.
8788654 8790238 Here.
8790322 8793700 I cannot self-terminate.<br />You must lower me into the steel.
8806839 8809299 I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.
8809383 8811676 No, it'll be okay.<br />Stay with us.
8811761 8813762 - It'll be okay.<br />- I have to go away.
8813846 8816431 No, don't do it.<br />Please, don't go.
8816515 8819601 I must go away, John.
8819685 8821144 No, wait.
8821228 8824147 - You don't have to do this.<br />- I'm sorry.
8825066 8827317 No, don't do it! Don't go!
8827401 8829360 It has to end here.
8830571 8833865 I order you not to go!
8841832 8843875 I know now why you cry.
8846253 8848713 But it's something<br />I can never do.
8883040 8885250 Good-bye.
8984475 8988728 August 29, 1997, came and went.
8988812 8993149 Nothing much happened.<br />Michael Jackson turned 40.
8993233 8995318 There was no Judgment Day.
8995402 8998613 People went to work<br />as they always do.
8998697 9004577 Laughed, complained,<br />watched TV, made love.
9004662 9006621 I wanted to run<br />through the street yelling ...
9006705 9012001 to grab them all and say,<br />"Every day from this day on is a gift.
9012086 9014379 Use it well."
9014463 9016965 Instead, I got drunk.
9017049 9019842 That was 30 years ago.
9019927 9024389 But the dark future which never came<br />still exists for me.
9024473 9028184 And it always will,<br />like the traces of a dream.
9030521 9034399 John fights the war differently<br />than it was foretold.
9034483 9037318 Here, on the battlefield<br />of the Senate ...
9037403 9040029 his weapons are common sense ...
9040781 9042949 and hope.
9044034 9046160 Tie me, Grandma. Tie me!
9054044 9056212 - How's that?<br />- Thank you, Grandma.
9059967 9062051 The luxury of hope ...
9062136 9064846 was given to me<br />by the Terminator.
9066056 9070977 Because if a machine can learn<br />the value of human life ...
9071979 9326173 maybe we can too.
