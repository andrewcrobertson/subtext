5174044 5175011 Excellent.
5186223 5189773 This is the best truck I got,<br />but the starter is gone.

5198360 5200988 - You get out tonight too, okay?<br />- Sure.
5202489 5205868 Just drop by any time<br />and totally fuck up my life.
5211456 5214209 See, I grew up in places like this,
5214543 5217217 so I thought<br />that's how people lived:
5217879 5221133 riding around in helicopters,
5221675 5223769 learning how to blow shit up.
5225595 5230351 But then, when my mom got busted,<br />I got put in a regular school.
5231727 5234196 The other kids were<br />into Nintendo.
5248702 5250500 Are you ever afraid?
5250746 5252043 No.

5314851 5316979 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung round with were geeks.
5317187 5320862 But there was this one guy,<br />he was kinda cool.
5321066 5324240 - He taught me engines.<br />- Hold here.
5325195 5327618 Mom screwed it up, of course.
5327823 5329871 She'd always tell 'em<br />about Judgment Day
5330075 5332453 and me being this world leader.
5333245 5337250 - That'd be all she wrote.<br />- Torque wrench, please.
5339668 5340760 Here.
5341795 5346221 - I wish I could've met my real dad.<br />- You will.
5346424 5351021 Yeah, I guess.<br />When I'm, like, 45, I think.

5377497 5380922 Mom and him were only together<br />for one night.
