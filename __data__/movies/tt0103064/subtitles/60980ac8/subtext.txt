870453 871921 This next patient is interesting.
872121 874590 I've been following<br />the case for years.
874791 876793 A 29-year-old female,
879212 881761 diagnosed as acute<br />schizo-affective disorder.
881964 884012 The usual indicators:<br />depression, anxiety,
884217 886766 violent acting out,<br />delusions of persecution.
893434 896563 The delusional architecture<br />is fairly unique.
896771 899615 She believes that a machine<br />called the Terminator,
899816 901033 which looked human, of course,
901234 903828 was sent back through time<br />to kill her.
904028 905154 That's original.
905363 908082 And also,<br />that the father of her child
908282 911126 was a soldier<br />sent back to protect her.
911327 913625 - No?<br />- He was from the future too.

932807 934684 Fine, Sarah.
935893 941070 She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap<br />with my pen a few weeks ago.

955872 956714 Lewis.
956914 959508 I don't like to see the patients<br />disrupting their rooms like this.
959709 962804 - See she takes her Thorazine.<br />- Sure. I'll take care of it.
975558 977435 Time to take you meds, Connor.
978394 979987 You take it.
980480 983359 You gotta be good.<br />You're up for review this afternoon.

1052510 1055229 - Could I speak with him, please?<br />- You could if he were here.
1055429 1058148 He took off on his bike this morning<br />so he could be anywhere.
1058349 1061853 - Do you have a photograph of John?<br />- Yeah. Hold on.
1064814 1067158 You gonna tell me what this is about?
1067358 1069235 I just need to ask him<br />a few questions.
1071696 1074700 He's a good-looking boy.<br />Do you mind if I keep this picture?
1074907 1078161 No, go on. There was a guy here<br />this morning looking for him, too.
1078369 1080087 Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
1080288 1082211 Has that got something<br />to do with this?

1149940 1153570 That's why she's at Pescadero.<br />It's a mental institute, OK?
1154445 1156322 She tried to blow up<br />a computer factory,

1212461 1214555 They took him away from me.
1214880 1218009 - He's the target now.<br />- I know!
1218217 1220094 He's alone.<br />You have to protect him.
1220302 1221599 I know.
1222638 1224561 You tell me how I am supposed<br />to do that.
1225349 1226976 He doesn't even<br />believe me anymore.
1228227 1229319 I've lost him.
1229645 1231272 You're strong, Sarah.
1231605 1233824 - Stronger than you ever thought.<br />- No.
1235276 1236619 On your feet, soldier!
1238779 1241248 I love you. I always will.
1243868 1246712 - I need you.<br />- I'll always be with you.
1251167 1252840 Remember the message?
1254545 1256013 "The future is not set.
1257381 1260851 "There is no fate<br />but what we make for ourselves."
1281197 1282449 Stay with me.

1293834 1295552 KWQ, don't go!
1307765 1309017 Kyle!
1381672 1384926 It's like a giant strobe light,
1385634 1387511 burning right to my eyes.
1392057 1394151 Somehow I can still see.
1405779 1408874 We know<br />the dream's the same every night.
1409241 1412415 - Why do I have to...<br />- Please continue.
1416332 1418835 Children look like burnt paper.
1420586 1422054 Black.
1423005 1424632 Not moving.
1426550 1429394 And then the blast wave hits them.
1438354 1440777 And they fly apart like leaves.
1442733 1447910 Dreams of cataclysm,<br />the end of the world are very common.
1449907 1454003 It's not a dream, you moron.<br />It's real.
1454203 1457958 - I know the date it happens.<br />- I'm sure it feels very real to you.
1458165 1463262 On August 291997, it's gonna feel<br />pretty fuckin' real to you, too!
1464546 1466924 Anybody not wearing<br />two-million sunblock
1467132 1469635 is gonna have<br />a real bad day. Get it?
1470135 1472854 God! You think you're safe and alive.
1473055 1475228 You're already dead. Everybody!
1475432 1477855 Him. You. You're dead already.
1478060 1480813 This whole place,<br />everything you see is gone!
1481021 1483991 You're the one<br />living in a fucking dream, Silberman!
1484191 1484987 Cos I know it happened!
1485192 1486785 It happened!
1498080 1500003 I feel much better now.
1501208 1502960 Clearer.
1503168 1508516 Yes, your attitude has been<br />much improved lately.
1517725 1520069 It's helped me to have a goal,
1520853 1523322 something to look forward to.
1523522 1524569 What is that?
1525441 1530914 Well, you said that if I showed<br />improvement after six months,
1531113 1533662 you would transfer me<br />to the minimum security wing
1533866 1536961 and I could have visitors.
1538245 1541545 Well, it's been six months and...
1543459 1545587 I was looking forward<br />to seeing my son.
1546795 1548297 I see.
1551467 1556564 Let's go back to what you were saying<br />about those Terminator machines.
1556764 1560018 Now you think they don't exist?
1560225 1562444 They don't exist.
1562644 1564237 I know that now.
1564438 1566236 But you've told me<br />on many occasions
1566440 1569785 about how you crushed one<br />in a hydraulic press.
1571153 1574157 If I had, there would have been<br />some evidence.
1574364 1576662 They would have found something<br />at the factory.
1576867 1578869 I see.
1579078 1582924 So, you don't believe any more<br />that the company covered it up?
1585084 1587553 No. Why would they?
1588462 1590715 Let's try a new position right there.
1590923 1595099 The neuronal sensors are correct,<br />because it works.
1595302 1597805 - Right.<br />- Those neurons are all centred.
1598680 1600682 Maybe<br />the inhibitor circuits failed...
1600891 1601983 Mr Dyson?
1602810 1605859 Mr Dyson, the materials team<br />is running another...
1607022 1608569 - Mr Dyson.<br />- Yes?
1608774 1611618 The materials team is running<br />another series this afternoon.
1611819 1614663 You have to sign for the...<br />Er... it.
1614863 1617787 - You have to sign it out.<br />- OK. Come on. I'll get it.
1619576 1620623 Mr Dyson,
1620828 1622671 I know I haven't been here long, but<br />I was wondering if you could tell me,
1622871 1625044 - I mean, if you know...<br />- Know what?
1625249 1627798 Well, if you know<br />where "it" came from.
1628001 1631301 I asked them that very same question<br />once. You know what they told me?
1631505 1632677 "Don't ask."
1639388 1641482 - Good morning, Mr Dyson.<br />- How's it going?
1642474 1643771 Insert key.
1643976 1646946 Left on three, two, one, turn.
1650858 1652610 - How are the wife and kids?<br />- Great. Thanks.
1652818 1653990 There you go.
1681805 1684274 So,<br />what do you think, Doctor?
1685350 1687102 I have shown improvement, haven't I?
1688478 1691527 Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
1692441 1694068 I know how smart you are.
1694818 1696786 I think you're just telling me<br />what I want to hear.
1698030 1700624 I don't think you really believe<br />what you're telling me today.
1700908 1702626 I think if I put you<br />in minimum security,
1702826 1704828 you'll just try to escape again.
1709917 1712511 You have to let me see my son.
1713462 1714964 Please.
1716465 1717762 Please.
1719051 1722931 He's in great danger.<br />He's naked without me.
1723138 1724890 If I could just make a phone call...
1725098 1728022 Afraid not. Not for a while.
1729895 1732239 I don't see any choice<br />but to recommend to the review board
1732439 1734737 that you stay here<br />for another six months.
1738070 1739822 I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
1742407 1745661 - Get her off of me!<br />- You son of a bitch!
1745869 1748122 10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!
1749790 1752418 - You don't know what you're doing!<br />- Get some restraints in here now!
1755170 1757798 You don't know what you're doing!
1762219 1764267 Model citizen.
1803635 1806229 You just missed him.<br />He was here 15 minutes ago.
1806430 1808023 He said he was going to the galleria?
1808223 1809270 Yeah.
1809474 1811101 The galleria?
1857147 1859525 I'm gonna get some quarters.<br />I'll be back, all right?
1874581 1877209 - Oh, no!<br />- Girls, do you know John Connor?
1877417 1878919 No.
1881088 1884968 - Hey, do you know this guy?<br />- Nah, I don't know him.
1891556 1893149 - John.<br />- Not now.
1893350 1896194 Hey, there's this cop<br />scoping for you. Check it out.
1899648 1901571 - He's right over there.<br />- Split, man.
1901775 1903698 - Just go.<br />- Yeah.
1908949 1909950 I saw that kid...
1910158 1911284 Hey!
1925632 1927350 Hey! You're not supposed<br />to be in here!
1945527 1947074 Hey!
1953201 1954248 Get down.
2025398 2027196 Mister, are you all right?
2045043 2046090 Come on!
2086334 2087677 Goddamn!
2290205 2291627 Agh!
2366823 2369201 OK. Time out. Stop the bike.
2369409 2371332 Time out. Come on, stop the bike.
2385174 2387768 Holy shit.<br />Now, don't take this the wrong way.
2387969 2390017 - But you are a Terminator, right?<br />- Yes.
2390221 2394067 - Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.<br />- No?
2404777 2408873 Holy shit! You're really real.
2411284 2412752 I mean...
2415413 2419793 You're like a machine underneath,<br />right? But sort of alive outside?
2420001 2421799 I'm a cybernetic organism:
2422003 2424552 living tissue<br />over metal endoskeleton.
2439437 2441485 This is intense.
2441689 2444408 Get a grip, John. OK.
2447070 2449072 You're not here to kill me.
2449280 2453205 I figured that part out for myself.<br />So what's the deal?
2453409 2456003 My mission is to protect you.
2456204 2458707 Yeah? Who sent you?
2459999 2461000 You did.
2461209 2462552 35 years from now,
2462752 2466131 you reprogrammed me to be<br />your protector here, in this time.
2466339 2469092 Oh, this is deep.
2491698 2494542 This other guy,<br />he's a terminator like you, right?
2494742 2498212 Not like me.<br />A T-1000, advanced prototype.
2499914 2504340 - More advanced than you are?<br />- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
2505253 2507676 - What the hell does that mean?<br />- Liquid metal.
2509424 2510550 Where are we going?
2510758 2512510 We have to get out of the city<br />immediately
2512719 2513971 and avoid the authorities.
2514762 2517436 Listen, I got to stop by my house.<br />I want to pick up some stuff.
2517640 2521611 Negative. The T-1000 would definitely<br />try to reacquire you there.
2521811 2524485 - You sure?<br />- I would.
2535241 2537835 Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...
2540163 2541506 ...but I gotta warn them.
2541706 2544050 Shit! You got a quarter?
2552884 2555763 - Hello.<br />- 'Janelle, it's me.'
2555970 2558189 - John?<br />- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'
2558389 2560687 - Are you guys OK?<br />- 'Sure, honey, everything's OK.'
2560892 2563896 - Are you all right?<br />- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'
2564103 2567573 John, it's late.<br />I was beginning to worry about you.
2567774 2570323 If you hurry home, we can sit down<br />and have dinner together.
2570526 2571948 I'm making beef stew.
2572153 2574247 Something's wrong.<br />She's never this nice.
2574447 2576825 John, where are you?
2577033 2579786 What the hell is the goddamn dog<br />barking at?
2579994 2583123 Hey, shut up,<br />you worthless piece of shit!
2583331 2584674 The dog's really barking.
2584874 2586968 You were gonna tell the kid<br />to get rid of that fucking mutt.
2591005 2593633 John, honey, it's late.<br />Please don't make me worry.
2593841 2597846 - Could he already be there?<br />- Honey, are you OK?
2598054 2600227 I'm right here. I'm fine.
2600431 2601933 'Are you sure you're all right?'
2602141 2604940 - What's the dog's name?<br />- Max.
2605561 2607780 Janelle, what's wrong<br />with Wolfie?
2607980 2610449 I can hear him barking. Is he OK?
2610650 2613324 Wolfie's fine, honey.<br />Wolfie's just fine.
2614654 2616156 Where are you?
2617949 2619826 Your foster parents are dead.
2656821 2658823 No, no. I need a minute here.
2659031 2663207 You're telling me that this thing<br />can imitate anything it touches?
2663411 2665755 Anything it samples<br />by physical contact.
2665955 2667753 Get real.
2667957 2671587 It could disguise itself<br />as a pack of cigarettes?
2671794 2673467 No, only an object of equal size.
2673671 2676094 Why not just become a bomb<br />or something to get me?
2676299 2680020 It can't form complex machines.<br />Guns, explosives have chemicals,
2680219 2682392 moving parts.<br />It doesn't work that way.
2682597 2684190 But it can form solid metal shapes.
2684390 2687234 - Like what?<br />- Knives and stabbing weapons.
2804885 2807138 These were taken<br />by a video surveillance camera
2807346 2810691 at the West Highland police station<br />in 1984.
2812184 2815108 He killed<br />17 police officers that night.
2816731 2818859 Men with families...
2820234 2821827 ...children.
2823321 2827667 These were taken at a mall<br />in Reseda today.
2829035 2832960 Miss Connor,<br />we know you know who this guy is.
2835124 2839425 Look, I just sat here and told you<br />that your son is missing.
2839628 2841505 That the foster parents<br />have been murdered.
2841714 2843967 We know this guy's involved.
2845176 2849022 Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br />Don't you care?
2853392 2859525 - We're wasting our time. Let's go.<br />- Sorry, guys.
2859732 2862235 She's grown more and more<br />disconnected from reality
2862443 2863945 as time goes on.
2864153 2865826 I'm afraid she can't help us now.
2866030 2869705 If she clears at all and can<br />give us anything, I'll call you.
2869909 2871252 Sure.
2871452 2874205 Douglas,<br />take her back to her room, please.
2874413 2875505 Yes, sir.
2877166 2879214 Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
2879418 2884390 You see, we spent a lot of time<br />in Nicaragua and places like that.
2886509 2890139 For a while there, she was with<br />this crazy ex-Green Beret guy
2890429 2891555 running guns.
2891764 2894608 Then there were some other guys.
2894809 2896561 She'd shack up with anybody<br />she could learn from
2896769 2899989 so she could teach me how to be<br />this great military leader.
2901857 2903780 Then she gets busted.
2903984 2907488 It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's<br />a psycho. Didn't you know?"
2909824 2911747 It's like everything<br />I'd been brought up to believe
2911951 2913703 was all made-up bullshit.
2913911 2916334 I hated her for that.
2919667 2922295 But everything she said was true.
2923671 2925548 She knew.
2927800 2929802 And nobody believed her.
2931637 2933480 Not even me.
2935516 2937268 Listen,<br />we gotta get her out of there.
2937476 2940821 Negative. The T-1000's<br />highest probability for success now
2941021 2942238 will be to copy Sarah Connor
2942440 2943942 and wait for you<br />to make contact with her.
2944150 2946118 Great. What happens to her?
2946318 2949071 Typically, the subject<br />being copied is terminated.
2949280 2952250 Shit! Why didn't you tell me?<br />We gotta go right now!
2952450 2954578 Negative.<br />It's not a mission priority.
2954785 2956787 Fuck you! She's a priority to me!
2958664 2961508 Goddamn it!<br />What's your problem? Damn it!
2961709 2964553 - Help! Help!<br />- This does not help our mission.
2964753 2967097 Get this psycho off of me! Help!
2967298 2970222 Help! I'm being kidnapped!<br />Get this psycho off of me!
2970426 2971348 Let me go!
2976015 2979645 - Why the hell did you do that?<br />- Because you told me to.
2982480 2984153 What?
2988986 2990954 You have to do what I say, huh?
2991155 2993249 That's one of my mission parameters.
2994533 2998037 Prove it. Stand on one foot.
3000247 3001590 Yes!
3003792 3007387 Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
3008881 3011600 - You OK, kid?<br />- Take a hike, bozo.
3011800 3016226 - Let's get outta here, man.<br />- Fuck you, you little dipshit!
3017056 3018649 Dipshit?
3020684 3022686 Put your leg down.
3022895 3027571 - Did you call moi dipshit?<br />- Just trying to help this punk.
3027775 3030028 Grab this guy.<br />I can't believe he called me...
3030236 3032864 Agh! God! Get him off of me!
3033072 3036121 Now who's the dipshit,<br />you jock douche bag?
3036325 3037542 Get off me!
3043749 3044875 No!
3046126 3048424 Put the gun down, now!
3048629 3051803 - Get outta here!<br />- Come on. Let's split!
3058806 3060649 Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!
3060849 3062851 Of course. I'm a Terminator.
3065187 3067736 Listen to me very carefully, OK?
3067940 3071160 You're not a Terminator anymore,<br />all right?
3071360 3073454 You got that?
3073654 3075998 You just can't go around<br />killing people.
3076198 3077074 Why?
3078033 3080206 What do you mean, why?<br />Cos you can't.
3080411 3081253 Why?
3081453 3084127 Because you just can't.<br />Trust me on this.
3090170 3093640 Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.
3093841 3097266 And I order you to help me.
3163452 3165204 Hm!
3242990 3244037 Hi!
3244241 3248291 - You have a Sarah Connor here?<br />- You're running late, aren't you?
3248495 3250748 They've been in there for an hour.
3250956 3253300 Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.
3255169 3257797 Oh, here come your friends now.
3277483 3279406 Well, that was productive.
3320859 3323863 - Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?<br />- No, thanks.
3324613 3325614 How 'bout a beer?
3325823 3327245 Yeah, right!
3351306 3354776 - Hey, I got a full house.<br />- That's good, Lewis.
3354977 3356900 Must be my lucky day.
3499579 3501957 I think you're right<br />about number 24.
3502165 3504884 Increase the medication<br />to 250 milligrams.
3505085 3507304 - Same time?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3521309 3523482 You!
3527816 3529614 You broke my arm.
3529818 3532412 There are 215 bones<br />in the human body.
3532612 3535161 That's one. Now, don't move.
3541163 3542836 What are you gonna do?
3546460 3548508 Why do we stop now?
3549838 3553559 You gotta promise me<br />you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
3553759 3556228 - Right.<br />- Swear?
3556428 3557805 What?
3558013 3561017 Just put up your hand and say,<br />"I swear I won't kill anyone."
3562184 3566064 - I swear I will not kill anyone.<br />- All right. Let's go.
3573236 3576991 Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,<br />Monday through Friday.
3581286 3585041 - What the hell are you doing?<br />- You son of a bitch! You shot me!
3586708 3588176 You crazy bastard!
3592589 3594717 Don't shoot me again.<br />Don't kill me.
3598512 3600014 He'll live.
3614861 3616863 Son of a bitch!
3617989 3619662 Let's try to remain calm.
3619866 3621664 Open it, or he'll be dead<br />before he hits the floor.
3621868 3623791 There's no way, Connor. Let him go.
3623995 3626123 Open the door.<br />It ain't gonna happen.
3626331 3628174 Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.
3628375 3630002 It won't work, Sarah.<br />You're no killer.
3630210 3631553 I don't believe you can do it.
3631753 3633005 You're already dead, Silberman.
3633213 3634635 Everybody dies.<br />You know I believe it.
3634840 3638470 - So don't fuck with me!<br />- Open the door. Open the door.
3644766 3646985 Back off!
3647185 3648482 Get back!
3648687 3650485 I'll pump him full of this shit.<br />I swear!
3652357 3653904 Don't move!
3655235 3658205 - Drop the shit!<br />- Do it! Do it!
3658780 3661078 Get in the office.<br />On the floor, face down.
3661283 3662375 Not you!
3662576 3664078 Open the door.
3667080 3669333 On the floor. Hold it open.<br />Face the wall!
3686558 3688060 Get her! Get her!
3714294 3715841 Sarah!
3716046 3718890 - Hurry up! Open the door!<br />- The door's locked!
3719883 3721851 Let's go! Open it!
3722052 3722848 Get the other door!
3724471 3726314 - She broke it off.<br />- Open it!
3731853 3734026 Let's go around! Come on!<br />Move it!
3759422 3760719 No!
3760924 3762267 No!
3764344 3767314 - No!<br />- Mom, wait!
3767514 3768811 Mom!
3774437 3777987 - Come back here!<br />- No! No!
3778608 3779700 No!
3779901 3781403 - Help her!<br />- Wait here.
3781611 3783113 Hurry UP!
3783321 3785289 He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!
3785490 3786582 Hold her.
3788285 3789832 He'll kill us all!
3811474 3813727 Mom, are you OK? Mom!
3818440 3820738 Come with me, if you want to live.
3820942 3823161 It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.<br />It's OK.
3847969 3849095 Go.
3881586 3883964 What the fuck is it?<br />What the fuck is going on?
3898895 3900238 Get down.
3916830 3918548 No! Mom!
3936683 3938060 Out of the car!
3939602 3940649 Right now!
3965462 3967135 Go!
3977557 3978604 I'm out.
3985565 3987317 - Come on.<br />- Here.
3990028 3991951 Reload.
4001039 4002882 Last one!
4010006 4011633 Hang on.
4037992 4039244 Ready!
4044832 4046175 John!
4053258 4054885 Here, drive.
4108563 4110565 He's not back there.<br />There's nobody behind us.
4110773 4112946 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah.
4115194 4118494 - Can you even see anything?<br />- I see everything.
4121659 4123127 Cool.
4126873 4128420 Come here.
4134547 4136174 I said I was OK.
4137133 4140103 John,<br />it was stupid of you to go there.
4141220 4143348 God damnit! You have to be<br />smarter than that.
4143556 4145024 You almost got yourself killed.
4146392 4147985 What were you thinking?
4149020 4151523 You cannot risk yourself,<br />even for me.
4151731 4153074 Do you understand?
4153274 4157450 You're too important.<br />Do you understand?
4160448 4161449 But...
4163284 4166879 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
4168247 4170466 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
4177799 4179301 What's wrong with your eyes?
4181469 4182812 Nothing.
4192814 4195112 So, what's your story?
4205702 4206749 You OK?
4206953 4208375 Fine.
4210289 4213384 Say, that's a nice bike.
4235398 4237526 Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.
4245366 4248336 Listen,<br />do you know what you're doing?
4248536 4251380 I have detailed files<br />on human anatomy.
4252331 4257303 I bet! Makes you<br />a more efficient killer, right?
4257503 4258550 Correct.
4265261 4266558 Does it hurt when you get shot?
4268598 4271442 I sense injuries. The data<br />could be called pain.
4273978 4275730 John, help me with the light.
4275980 4277948 - Will these heal up?<br />- Yes.
4278316 4281616 Good. If you can't pass for human,<br />you're not much good to us.
4282570 4285323 How long do you live,<br />I mean "last", whatever?
4285990 4288243 120 years with<br />my existing power cell.
4288743 4291212 Can you learn stuff you<br />haven't been programmed with?
4291579 4296380 So you can be...<br />you know, more human?
4297335 4298803 Not such a dork all the time?
4303132 4306136 My CPU is a neural-net processor,<br />a learning computer,
4306385 4309389 hat Skynet presets to READ<br />only when we are sent out alone.
4312308 4314185 Doesn't want you<br />to do too much thinking.
4314727 4315774 No.
4317563 4319281 Can we reset the switch?
4337750 4341345 Rotate the two locking cylinders<br />counterclockwise.
4347844 4348686 Do it.
4357645 4359147 Now open the port cover.
4362567 4364615 Pull to break the seal.
4368614 4372118 Good, now remove<br />the shock damping assembly.
4375830 4377958 You can now access the CPU.
4379375 4380843 - Do you see it?<br />- Yes.
4381711 4383588 Pull the CPU by its base tap.
4385548 4386344 Pull.
4424503 4425595 Can you see the pin switch?
4426172 4427424 No!
4429175 4431098 - Out of my way, John!<br />- Don't kill him!
4432470 4434893 "It", John, not "him".
4435139 4438063 Okay, "it". But we need "it".
4438893 4440486 Listen to me. Listen.
4441520 4443022 We're better off on our own.
4443606 4446780 He's the only proof of<br />the future, the war and that.
4448235 4449327 Maybe.
4452156 4453533 I don't trust it.
4454450 4455702 But he's my friend, alright?
4456827 4459171 You don't know what it's like<br />to kill these things.
4459705 4462504 If something goes wrong,<br />this could be our last chance.
4462708 4465302 If I'm supposed to<br />be this military leader,
4465503 4468552 maybe you start listening<br />to my ideas once in a while.
4472259 4475889 'Cause if my own mother won't,<br />how do you expect anyone else to?
4491195 4494039 Alright, play it your way.
4501539 4503541 Was there a problem?
4503749 4505126 No problem.
4506836 4508053 None whatsoever.
4541704 4543206 Are we learning yet?
4556218 4559188 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
4563100 4564943 Just head south.
4573486 4574954 Keep it under 65.
4575154 4577782 - We don't wanna be pulled over.<br />- Affirmative.
4578616 4583497 No, no, no. You gotta listen<br />to the way people talk.
4583704 4587129 You don't say "affirmative"<br />or some shit like that.
4587333 4589506 <i>You say, "No problemo."</i>
4589710 4593510 And if someone comes up to you<br />with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"
4593714 4597844 And if you want to shine them on,<br />it's <i>"Hasta</i> la vista, baby."
4598719 4600471 <i>Hasta</i> la vista, baby.
4601514 4603232 Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."
4603432 4606231 And if someone gets upset,<br />you say, "Chill out."
4606435 4610861 - Or you can do combinations.<br />- Chill out, dick-wad.
4611774 4613697 That's great. See? You're getting it.
4613901 4615824 <i>No problemo.</i>
4626163 4629383 - You got any cash?<br />- I got a couple of hundred bucks.
4629708 4630925 I'll give you half.
4631919 4633045 Mom!
4634505 4635802 Get some food.
4638467 4640265 No sense of humor.
4646267 4647940 And that's another thing:
4648269 4649771 lighten up a bit.
4650771 4654867 This severe routine is getting old.<br />You're acting like such a geek.
4655109 4656577 Smile once in a while.
4656819 4658162 Smile?
4658487 4660865 Yeah. You know, smile.
4661198 4662245 Watch.
4663742 4667042 Hi. Nice place you got here.<br />How's business?
4667955 4669423 Gimme a break.
4670833 4673427 Okay. Bad example.
4674295 4677265 See that guy over there?<br />That's a smile.
4697526 4698573 That's good.
4698819 4701948 You could practice<br />in front of a mirror or something.
4709413 4710665 Want some of my fries?
4721425 4722551 Do you need any help?
4723260 4724227 No.
4724428 4726146 - Got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4726347 4727815 - Got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4735189 4736862 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4739526 4740778 People, I mean.
4743781 4745783 It's in your nature<br />to destroy yourselves.
4746951 4749579 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4749787 4752666 Break it up<br />before I wring both of your necks.
4754792 4759138 I need to know how Skynet gets built,<br />who's responsible.
4759338 4762808 The man most directly responsible<br />is Miles Bennett Dyson.
4763717 4764843 Who is that?
4765052 4768181 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
4771475 4773102 Why him?
4773310 4775563 In a few months he creates<br />a revolutionary type
4775771 4777023 of microprocessor.
4777773 4781027 - Go on. Then what?<br />- In three years,
4781235 4783203 Cyberdyne will become the largest<br />supplier
4783404 4784656 of military computer systems.
4785656 4788455 All Stealth bombers are upgraded<br />with Cyberdyne computers,
4788659 4790002 becoming fully unmanned.
4790202 4793331 Afterwards, they fly<br />with a perfect operational record.
4793539 4795917 The Skynet Funding bill is passed.
4796125 4799425 The system goes on-line<br />on August 41997.
4799628 4802552 Human decisions are removed<br />from strategic defence.
4802756 4805475 Skynet begins to learn<br />at a geometric rate.
4805676 4809852 It becomes self-aware at 02:14am<br />Eastern time, August 29.
4811015 4813359 In a panic,<br />they try to pull the plug.
4814685 4816904 - Skynet fights back.<br />- Yes.
4817104 4819607 It launches its missiles<br />against the targets in Russia.
4819815 4822864 Why attack Russia?<br />Aren't they our friends now?
4823068 4825321 Because Skynet knows<br />that the Russian counterattack
4825529 4827327 will eliminate its enemies over here.
4827531 4829033 Jesus!
4832453 4833625 How much do you know about Dyson?
4836415 4838088 I have detailed files.
4839668 4841136 Want to know everything.
4842755 4846134 What he looks like.<br />Where he lives. Everything.
4858020 4859272 Miles!
4881460 4884714 - You going to work all day?<br />- I'm sorry, baby.
4885172 4886924 This thing<br />is kicking my ass.
4887383 4891138 It's Sunday. You promised to take<br />the kids to Raging Waters today.
4893055 4896275 I can't. I'm on a roll.
4910114 4913368 This is gonna blow 'em away.<br />It's a neural-net processor.
4913617 4915085 I know. You told me.
4915327 4918080 It thinks and learns like we do.
4918539 4920962 It's superconducting<br />at room temperature.
4921208 4925179 Other computers are just<br />pocket calculators by comparison.
4927464 4929137 Why is that so important?
4929383 4931852 I need to know,<br />'cause sometimes I feel like
4932302 4934430 I'm going crazy here.
4935973 4937896 Baby, I am this close.
4938934 4939981 Come here.
4942312 4946158 Imagine a jet airliner<br />with a pilot that never gets tired,
4946400 4949574 never makes mistakes,<br />never shows up with a hangover.
4952072 4953915 Meet the pilot.
4954491 4958667 Why did we get married?<br />Have children? You don't need us.
4959413 4962587 Your heart and your mind<br />are in here.
4962916 4965089 But it doesn't love you like we do.
4973510 4975933 I'm sorry. Really.
4976680 4980275 How about spending some time<br />with your other babies?
4983312 4985030 - Raging Waters?<br />- Yeah!
5015260 5016887 Wait in the car.
5035447 5037324 Enrique!
5037533 5039877 Are you here?
5055300 5056643 You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
5059054 5064857 And you... are always like a snake.
5066979 5068981 It's great<br />to see you, Connor!
5069189 5070236 I told you I would be back.
5070440 5073159 I knew you would.<br />It's good to see you.
5073360 5074202 Jolanda!
5074403 5077623 Get out here, we got company.<br />And bring some tequila.
5077823 5080952 - Hey, big John. Como te va?<br />- What's up?
5081159 5082877 Who's this big guy?
5083078 5088050 He's cool, Enrique.<br />He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.
5088250 5090093 Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
5090294 5092717 Uncle Bob, huh?
5093297 5095800 OK. OK!
5097175 5098267 How are you?
5098468 5101768 How are you?<br />You've grown so much.
5101972 5103474 Drink?
5107769 5109021 Uncle Bob?
5110105 5114110 Hey, Sarita! You're pretty<br />famous, all over the goddamn TV.
5114318 5116867 Pictures of you, John,<br />your big friend here.
5117070 5119789 Cops are going nuts<br />looking for you.
5122701 5123827 I just came for my stuff.
5124036 5126505 I need clothes,<br />food and one of your trucks.
5126705 5128673 How about the fillings<br />out of my fucking teeth?
5128874 5131377 Now, Enrique!
5132419 5136219 - You two, you're on weapons detail.<br />- Come on. Let's go.
5157110 5159533 One thing about my mom...
5161365 5163493 ...she always plans ahead.
5174044 5175011 Excellent.
5186223 5189773 This is the best truck I got,<br />but the starter is gone.
5189976 5192820 - You got the time to change it out?<br />- Yeah.
5193021 5194944 I'm gonna wait till dark<br />to cross the border.
5195065 5198069 Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.
5198360 5200988 - You get out tonight too, okay?<br />- Sure.
5202489 5205868 Just drop by any time<br />and totally fuck up my life.
5211456 5214209 See, I grew up in places like this,
5214543 5217217 so I thought<br />that's how people lived:
5217879 5221133 riding around in helicopters,
5221675 5223769 learning how to blow shit up.
5225595 5230351 But then, when my mom got busted,<br />I got put in a regular school.
5231727 5234196 The other kids were into Nintendo.
5248702 5250500 Are you ever afraid?
5250746 5252043 No.
5256293 5257510 Not even of dying?
5258587 5259679 No.
5264676 5268601 You don't feel any emotion about it<br />one way or another?
5268847 5271475 No.<br />I have to stay functional
5271725 5273773 until the mission is complete.
5278356 5280324 Then it doesn't matter.
5280817 5284367 Yeah. I have to stay functional too.<br />I'm "too important".
5301129 5302597 That's definitely you.
5314851 5316979 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung round with were geeks.
5317187 5320862 But there was this one guy,<br />he was kinda cool.
5321066 5324240 - He taught me engines.<br />- Hold here.
5325195 5327618 Mom screwed it up, of course.
5327823 5329871 She'd always tell 'em about<br />Judgment Day
5330075 5332453 and me being this world leader.
5333245 5337250 - That'd be all she wrote.<br />- Torque wrench, please.
5339668 5340760 Here.
5341795 5346221 - I wish I could've met my real dad.<br />- You will.
5346424 5351021 Yeah, I guess.<br />When I'm, like, 45, I think.
5352305 5355479 I sent him back through time<br />to 1984.
5356309 5357561 Man!
5359271 5361569 He hasn't even been born yet.
5363316 5365284 It messes with your head.
5367904 5370532 - The other bolt.<br />- Oh. Here.
5377497 5380922 Mom and him were only together<br />for one night.
5381126 5386303 She still loves him, I guess.<br />I see her crying sometimes.
5386506 5387928 She denies it totally, of course,
5388133 5390932 like she got something<br />stuck in her eye.
5395181 5396683 Why do you cry?
5397809 5399607 - You mean people?<br />- Yeah.
5399811 5402280 I don't know. We just cry.
5403231 5405575 You know, when it hurts.
5411865 5416871 - Pain causes it?<br />- Er... no. It's different.
5417078 5420048 It's when there's nothing wrong<br />with you, but you hurt anyways.
5420248 5421670 - Get it?<br />- No.
5423043 5424636 All right, my man!
5424836 5428056 - No prob/em o-<br />- Give me five.
5430592 5432515 Just put out your hand, like this.
5433887 5437608 All right! Now hit me.<br />Give me five. Do the same thing.
5437807 5439855 All right!
5442771 5445115 OK, that's good. Up high! High five!
5446232 5447358 Five low.
5447567 5449069 Too slow.
5452238 5454366 I'm just kidding. One more time.
5454574 5456668 Good. Now try it. Good!
5456868 5458620 Now do me. Give me five.
5460330 5462332 'Watching John<br />with the machine,
5462540 5464713 it was suddenly so clear.
5464918 5467888 'The Terminator would never stop.
5468088 5471763 'It would never leave him<br />and it would never hurt him,
5471967 5475392 'never shout at him<br />or get drunk and hit him
5475595 5477893 'or say it was too busy<br />to spend time with him.
5478932 5483654 'It would always be there<br />and it would die to protect him.
5485397 5488401 'Of all the would-be fathers<br />who came and went over the years,
5488608 5492954 'this thing, this machine,<br />was the only one who measured up.
5493947 5498373 'In an insane world,<br />it was the sanest choice.'
5531401 5536248 Come here, darling.
5596007 5598226 Hey, let's try this one.
5603598 5605145 There we go.
5711372 5713795 She said you go south<br />with him like you planned.
5714000 5717004 - She'll meet you tomorrow.<br />- Mom!
5717212 5718964 Mom, wait!
5734437 5736155 "No fate".
5737482 5739701 "No fate, but what we make."
5741861 5743488 My father told her this.
5746491 5751088 I mean, I made him memorise it<br />in the future as a message to her.
5752330 5757507 Never mind.<br />Now, OK, the whole thing goes...
5757710 5760338 The future's not set.
5760546 5763971 There's no fate,<br />but what we make for ourselves.
5764175 5768681 - She intends to change the future.<br />- Yeah, I guess.
5770139 5771857 Oh, shit!
5772058 5773856 - Dyson.<br />- Yeah.
5774060 5777439 Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
5777647 5779524 She's gonna blow him away.
5779732 5781609 Come on! Let's go!
5781818 5783491 Let's go! Come on!
5794247 5797251 - This is tactically dangerous.<br />- Drive faster.
5797458 5801213 The T-1000 has the same files<br />that I do. It knows what I know.
5801421 5805927 - It might anticipate this move.<br />- I don't care. We gotta stop her.
5806134 5808512 Killing Dyson might prevent the war.
5808720 5810438 I don't care!
5810638 5812436 Haven't you learned anything yet?
5812640 5814813 Haven't you figured out<br />why you can't kill people?
5817687 5820531 Look, maybe you don't care<br />if you live or die.
5820773 5823822 But everybody's not like that!<br />We have feelings.
5824027 5825950 We hurt. We're afraid.
5828531 5832786 You gotta learn this stuff.<br />I'm not kidding. It's important.
5869280 5873080 Danny, I told you<br />to go to bed. I'm not kidding.
5873284 5875286 Just a couple of minutes,<br />Mom!
5892637 5894810 Danny, your time is up.
5894972 5897691 Come brush your teeth<br />and get to bed.
5926337 5927554 Danny!
5929006 5930633 Ugh!
5939308 5943063 - Daddy!<br />- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!
5944772 5945819 Miles?
5949569 5950991 Miles!
5951195 5953493 - Tarissa, run!<br />- Oh, my God!
5960705 5962628 Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!
5962832 5963958 Run!
5964167 5965794 Oh, Jesus! Miles!
5985146 5987240 Daddy!<br />' Danny! Danny!
5987440 5990944 - Nobody fucking move!<br />- Don't hurt my daddy!
5991152 5994827 Get down on the floor, bitch.<br />Get down now!
5995031 5996783 Get out of the way.
5996991 5998584 Don't hurt him!
6000286 6001833 Get on the floor now!
6004123 6006592 Just let the boy go.
6006792 6009636 Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
6009837 6012306 It's all your fault, motherfucker.
6012507 6014635 - It's all your fault!<br />- What?
6014842 6016844 I'm not gonna let you do it.
6035488 6036614 Shhh!
6040868 6042085 Shhh.
6068938 6071316 Shit! We're too late!
6075528 6076529 Check them.
6080241 6083745 Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?
6084704 6086251 Look at me.
6088249 6090217 I almost...
6090418 6092341 I almost...
6102138 6106188 It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.<br />We'll figure something out. OK?
6108144 6109487 I promise.
6113357 6118534 - You came here to stop me.<br />- Yeah, I did.
6121616 6123414 I love you, John.
6125328 6127422 I always have.
6128873 6130716 I know.
6137173 6139221 Deep penetration.
6140968 6142766 No shattered bone.
6142970 6145769 You hold here. The pressure<br />should stop the bleeding.
6156692 6159866 - Who are you people?<br />- Show him.
6163157 6167207 Danny, I want you to come with me<br />right now. Show me your room.
6180257 6183386 Oh, God! No!
6195856 6198154 Oh, my God!
6207410 6208912 Oh, my God.
6209120 6211589 Now, listen to me very carefully.
6213999 6217378 Nuclear winter effects<br />caused massive cooling...
6217586 6221636 'Dyson listened while<br />the Terminator laid it all down.
6221841 6225436 'Skynet. Judgment Day.
6225636 6228685 'The history of things to come.
6229640 6231358 'It's not every day that you find out
6231559 6234938 you're responsible<br />for three billion deaths.
6235146 6237740 'He took it pretty well.'
6239150 6241744 I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
6248242 6252839 You're judging me<br />on things I haven't even done yet.
6256584 6259212 How were we supposed to know?
6261297 6262924 Yeah!
6263132 6264634 Right.
6265551 6268646 How were you supposed to know?
6268846 6272441 Fucking men like you<br />built the hydrogen bomb.
6272641 6276862 Men like you thought it up.
6280649 6283698 You think you're so creative.
6283903 6286952 You don't know what it's like<br />to really create something,
6287156 6290751 to create a life,<br />to feel it growing inside you.
6290951 6293204 All you know how to create<br />is death and destruction.
6293412 6294789 Mom!
6295748 6299378 We need to be a little more<br />constructive here. OK?
6299585 6301553 We still have to stop this<br />from happening, don't we?
6301754 6303472 But I thought...
6304673 6308519 Aren't we changing things right now,<br />changing the way it goes?
6308719 6312269 That's right. There's no way<br />I'm gonna finish the new processor.
6312473 6315147 Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.
6315351 6318946 - I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.<br />- That's not good enough.
6319146 6322150 - No one must follow your work.<br />- Right.
6323234 6327080 All right, then we have to destroy<br />all the stuff at the lab:
6327279 6331705 the files, the disk drives,<br />everything, everything here.
6332535 6335379 Everything. I don't care.
6337373 6338169 The chip.
6338791 6340338 - Do you know about the chip?<br />- What chip?
6340543 6342045 They keep it in a vault<br />at Cyberdyne.
6342253 6343505 It must be from<br />the other one like you.
6343712 6348092 - The CPU from the first Terminator.<br />- Son of a bitch! I knew it!
6348300 6350894 They told us<br />not to ask where they got it.
6351095 6353314 Those lying motherfuckers.
6353514 6355187 It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.
6355391 6357519 I mean,<br />it was smashed, it didn't work,
6357726 6359103 but it gave us ideas,
6359311 6362190 took us in new directions,<br />things we would've never th...
6364441 6366443 All my work was based on it.
6366652 6368325 It must be destroyed.
6370656 6373626 Can you get us in? Past security?
6373826 6376750 I think so, yeah. When?
6380791 6381758 Now?
6386005 6388679 'The future,<br />always so clear to me,
6388883 6391807 'had become<br />like a black highway at night.
6392011 6397563 'We were in uncharted territory now,<br />making up history as we went along.'
6433010 6437516 Hi. Er... Carl, right?
6439266 6441109 Friends from out of town.<br />I just thought I'd...
6441518 6442360 Hi!
6442770 6444647 ...take 'em upstairs<br />and show 'em around.
6444855 6448029 Mr Dyson, you know the rules<br />concerning visitors in the lab.
6448233 6450235 I need written authorisation...
6451445 6455166 - I insist.<br />- Don't even think about it.
6466126 6467673 Come on. It's OK.
6469088 6470465 It takes two keys to open the vault.
6470673 6472266 They have<br />to be turned simultaneously.
6472466 6475140 The other one is in a locker<br />at the security station.
6476762 6478014 Gibbons?
6481266 6485942 Gibbons! Come on, man!<br />You can't leave the desk like that!
6488232 6489484 Gibbons!
6490985 6492282 Oh, shit.
6510254 6512302 My card should access this.
6516010 6518138 - What? What is it?<br />- Damn it.
6519388 6521186 The silent alarm's been tripped.
6527312 6530111 It's neutralised all the codes<br />in the entire building.
6530315 6533910 Nothing will open anywhere now.<br />We have to abort.
6535154 6536576 No.
6538282 6541456 We go all the way. OK?
6543746 6547421 You guys get started on the lab.<br />I can open this.
6547624 6549046 I think it's that guy from the mall.
6549251 6550173 It is!
6550377 6552550 It's him and the woman.
6553881 6556725 Look, just send everything<br />you got in the area right now.
6559303 6562557 I have a personal entry code<br />for the lab. It may still work.
6567227 6569400 - It's no good.<br />- Let me try mine.
6574651 6576619 John, fire in the hold!
6588791 6593467 Wait! You can't go in there.<br />The fire set off the halon system.
6600761 6603105 You have<br />to wait until the gas clears.
6605724 6606850 Put this on.
6621115 6623368 All right, let's get to work.
6645305 6648229 All units in the vicinity,<br />all units able to respond:
6648433 6652939 A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer<br />Street, the Cyberdyne building.
6653272 6655195 Suspect 1 is white, female,
6655399 6658403 identified as: last name Connor,<br />first name Sarah,
6658610 6661238 escaped from<br />Pescadero State Hospital.
6661738 6663035 Suspect 2: white, male...
6667327 6671377 All the disks in my office. All the<br />disks in that office over there.
6671623 6673591 Everything behind my desk.
6673834 6675836 All the processors on my left.
6676086 6678339 We'll blow it up with the CP4.
6692144 6693521 Could I...
6694021 6695568 Excuse me...
6697774 6699902 Could I borrow that thing?
6709244 6711667 I worked a lot<br />of years on this thing.
6715709 6719964 - Give me that location again.<br />- 2111, Kramer.
6720214 6723844 The suspects are armed and<br />considered extremely dangerous.
6775060 6776733 All right!
6776937 6778564 7-2-5-6.
6780148 6781070 Yes!
6785862 6787159 Easy money.
6791952 6793295 Uh-oh.
6795998 6798296 Oh, shit! Not good.
6798500 6799672 Not good!
6803505 6806759 - How we doing?<br />- Primer cord is set.
6806967 6809220 One more barrel, two more minutes.
6811263 6816110 - How do we set them off?<br />- Remote control.
6816310 6818563 Piece of cake.
6818770 6820192 - We got company.<br />- Police?
6820397 6823617 - How many?<br />- All of 'em, I think.
6823817 6825740 Go. I'll finish here.
6827195 6828492 Come on.
6829698 6832872 - I'll take care of the police.<br />- Wait! You swore!
6835996 6837248 Trust me.
6850677 6852554 'You at the window!
6852763 6855733 'Drop your weapon and place<br />your hands on top of your head!'
6857184 6860484 - Holy shit!<br />- That's a damn mini-gun!
6882959 6885132 - Come on!<br />- Oh, shit!

6955073 6957667 One, two, three, go.
6969588 6972137 All right, in order to get that out,<br />you have to...
6979848 6983478 We got Skynet by the balls now,<br />don't we? Come on, let's book.
6984853 6986196 Hold your fire!
7011838 7014091 - Ready to rock?<br />- Ready.
7017594 7020222 Time to go. Now.
7020430 7023229 - Take this. They'll use gas.<br />- Come on.
7023433 7026403 Get started on the door.<br />Miles, hand me the detonator.
7051002 7053425 Mom! Mom!

7689599 7691351 He's gaining.
7693311 7696110 - Step on it!<br />- This is the vehicle's top speed.
7696314 7698362 I can run faster than this!
7708701 7709998 Coming up, to the right.
7712663 7714006 Watch it! Watch it!

8743068 8744741 I need a vacation.
8759251 8762926 - Is it dead?<br />- Terminated.
8766466 8768059 Will this melt in there?
8771304 8772897 Yes. Throw it in.
8777769 8778611 <i>A 070's!</i>
8780647 8782820 And the chip.

8805839 8807216 There's one more chip.
8812220 8814188 And it must be destroyed also.
8819853 8821230 Here.
8821438 8825443 I cannot self-terminate.<br />You must lower me into the steel.
8831072 8832619 No.
8833908 8834704 No.
8838079 8840457 - I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.<br />- No!
8840665 8842667 No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.
8842876 8844753 - It'll be OK.<br />- I have to go away.
8844961 8847430 No, don't do it. Please, don't go.
8847630 8850383 - I must go away, John.<br />- No!
8851051 8852143 No, wait.
8852344 8855097 - You don't have to do this.<br />- I'm sorry.
8856264 8858312 No, don't do it! Don't go!
8858767 8860314 It has to end here.
8861644 8864818 I order you not to go!<br />I order you not to go!
8865023 8866525 I order you not to go!
8873073 8874825 I know now why you cry.
8877327 8879500 But it's something I can never do.
