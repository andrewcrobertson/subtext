799986 801448 John!
806743 808700 Your foster parents are kind of dicks, huh?
809579 812196 I swear, I have had it with that goddamn kid.
812415 814907 - He won't even answer me anymore.<br />- Honey, move.
815126 817914 Would you get off your butt and help me?
818129 820837 - Todd!<br />- What?
821049 824292 He hasn't cleaned that room of his<br />in a month.
824511 827424 Well, it's an emergency.<br />Hang on. I'll get right on it.
835230 836971 - Come on!<br />- John!
837190 840308 C'mon! Get your ass inside.<br />Do what your mother tells you.
841569 844152 She's not my mother, Todd.
870932 872389 This next patient is interesting.
872600 875058 I've been following the case for years.
875270 877262 A 29-year-old female,
879691 882229 diagnosed as acute schizo-affective disorder.
882443 884480 The usual indicators: depression, anxiety,
884696 887234 violent acting out, delusions of persecution.
893913 897031 The delusional architecture is fairly unique.
897250 900084 She believes that a machine<br />called the Terminator,
900295 904296 which looked human, of course,<br />was sent back through time to kill her.
904507 905623 That's original.
905842 908550 And also, that the father of her child
908761 911595 was a soldier sent back to protect her.
911806 914093 - No?<br />- He was from the future too.
914309 919100 The year 2029, if I remember correctly.
919314 921180 And here we are.
922025 923061 Morning, Sarah.
927530 931365 Good morning, Dr Silberman. How's the knee?
933286 935152 Fine, Sarah.
936372 941538 She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap<br />with my pen a few weeks ago.
942378 943710 Repeated escape attempts...
954057 956140 Let's move on, shall we?
956351 959976 Lewis, I don't like to see the patients<br />disrupting their rooms like this.
960188 963272 - See she takes her Thorazine.<br />- Sure. I'll take care of it.
986839 988831 Are you the legal guardian of John Connor?
989592 991959 That's right, Officer. What's he done now?
992804 995512 - Could I speak with him, please?<br />- You could if he were here.
995723 998431 He took off on his bike this morning<br />so he could be anywhere.
998643 1002136 - Do you have a photograph of John?<br />- Yeah. Hold on.
1005108 1007441 You gonna tell me what this is about?
1007652 1009518 I just need to ask him a few questions.
1011990 1014983 He's a good-looking boy.<br />Do you mind if I keep this picture?
1015201 1018444 No, go on. There was a guy here<br />this morning looking for him, too.
1018663 1020370 Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
1020581 1022493 Has that got something to do with this?
1024919 1028754 No. I wouldn't worry about him.
1030091 1032674 Thanks for your cooperation.

1051821 1053153 All right!
1053364 1056857 - PIN number 9003.<br />- Where'd you learn this stuff from?
1057076 1059489 From my mom. My real mom, I mean.

1064000 1066708 Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!
1066919 1069002 - Yes!<br />- Hey, it worked.
1069213 1072752 All right. Easy money. Come on!
1075386 1077378 Yes! Piece of cake.
1082977 1085765 - Is that her?<br />- Yes.
1085980 1090020 - She's pretty cool, huh?<br />- No, she's a complete psycho.
1090234 1093853 That's why she's at Pescadero.<br />It's a mental institute, okay?
1094739 1098110 She tried to blow up a computer factory,<br />but she got shot and arrested.
1098326 1099783 No shit.
1100620 1102907 She's a total loser.
1103122 1105705 Come on. Let's go spend some money.
1121265 1124804 It's like a giant strobe light
1125019 1127261 burning right through my eyes.
1131484 1133726 Somehow, I can still see.
1139784 1141571 Oh, God.
1145248 1148332 We know the dream's the same every night.
1148709 1151873 - Why do I have to...<br />- Please continue.
1155800 1158292 Children look like burnt paper.
1160054 1161511 Black.
1162473 1164089 Not moving.
1166018 1168852 And then the blast wave hits them.
1177822 1180235 And they fly apart like leaves.
1182201 1187367 Dreams of cataclysm,<br />the end of the world are very common.
1189375 1193460 It's not a dream, you moron. It's real.
1193671 1197415 - I know the date it happens.<br />- I'm sure it feels very real to you.
1197633 1202719 On August 29, 1997, it's gonna feel<br />pretty fuckin' real to you, too!
1204015 1206382 Anybody not wearing two-million sunblock
1206601 1209093 is gonna have a real bad day. Get it?
1209604 1212312 God! You think you're safe and alive.
1212523 1214685 You're already dead. Everybody!
1214901 1217314 Him. You. You're dead already.
1217528 1220271 This whole place, everything you see is gone!
1220489 1223448 You're the one<br />living in a fucking dream, Silberman!
1223659 1226242 Cos I know it happened! It happened!
1237548 1239460 I feel much better now.
1240676 1242417 Clearer.
1242637 1247974 Yes, your attitude has been<br />much improved lately.
1257193 1259526 It's helped me to have a goal,
1260321 1262779 something to look forward to.
1262990 1264026 What is that?
1264909 1270371 Well, you said that if I showed<br />improvement after six months,
1270581 1273119 you would transfer me<br />to the minimum security wing
1273334 1276418 and I could have visitors.
1277713 1281002 Well, it's been six months and...
1282927 1285044 I was looking forward to seeing my son.
1286264 1287755 I see.
1290935 1296021 Let's go back to what you were saying<br />about those Terminator machines.
1296232 1299475 Now you think they don't exist?
1299694 1301902 They don't exist.
1302113 1303695 I know that now.
1303906 1305693 But you've told me on many occasions
1305908 1309242 about how you crushed one<br />in a hydraulic press.
1310621 1313614 If I had, there would have been<br />some evidence.
1313833 1316120 They would have found something<br />at the factory.
1316335 1318327 I see.
1318546 1322381 So, you don't believe any more<br />that the company covered it up?
1324552 1327010 No. Why would they?
1327930 1330172 Let's try a new position right there.
1330391 1334556 The neuronal sensors are correct,<br />because it works.
1334770 1337262 - Right.<br />- Those neurons are all centred.
1338149 1340141 Maybe the inhibitor circuits failed...
1340359 1341440 Mr Dyson?
1342278 1345316 Mr Dyson, the materials team<br />is running another...
1346490 1348026 - Mr Dyson.<br />- Yes?
1348242 1351076 The materials team is running<br />another series this afternoon.
1351287 1354121 You have to sign for the... Er... it.
1354332 1357245 - You have to sign it out.<br />- Okay. Come on. I'll get it.
1359045 1360081 Mr Dyson,
1360296 1362128 I know I haven't been here long, but<br />I was wondering if you could tell me,
1362340 1364502 - I mean, if you know...<br />- Know what?
1364717 1367255 Well, if you know where "it" came from.
1367470 1370759 I asked them that very same question<br />once. You know what they told me?
1370973 1372134 "Don't ask."
1378856 1380939 - Good morning, Mr Dyson.<br />- How's it going?
1381942 1383228 Insert key.
1383444 1386403 Left on three, two, one, turn.
1390326 1392067 - How are the wife and kids?<br />- Great. Thanks.
1392286 1393447 There you go.
1421273 1423731 So, what do you think, Doctor?
1424819 1426560 I have shown improvement, haven't I?
1427947 1430985 Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
1431909 1433525 I know how smart you are.
1434286 1436243 I think you're just telling me<br />what I want to hear.
1437498 1440081 I don't think you really believe<br />what you're telling me today.
1440376 1444286 I think if I put you in minimum security,<br />you'll just try to escape again.
1449385 1451968 You have to let me see my son.
1452930 1454421 Please.
1455933 1457219 Please.
1458519 1462388 He's in great danger. He's naked without me.
1462606 1464347 If I could just make a phone call...
1464567 1467480 Afraid not. Not for a while.
1469363 1471696 I don't see any choice<br />but to recommend to the review board
1471907 1474194 that you stay here for another six months.
1477538 1479779 I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
1481876 1485119 - Get her off of me!<br />- You son of a bitch!
1485337 1487579 10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!
1489258 1491875 - You don't know what you're doing!<br />- Get some restraints in here now!
1494638 1497255 You don't know what you're doing!
1501687 1503724 Model citizen.
1543103 1545686 You just missed him.<br />He was here 15 minutes ago.
1545898 1547480 He said he was going to the galleria?
1547691 1548727 Yeah.
1548943 1550559 The galleria?
1596615 1598982 I'm gonna get some quarters.<br />I'll be back, all right?
1614049 1616666 - Oh, no!<br />- Girls, do you know John Connor?
1616885 1618376 No.
1620556 1624425 - Hey, do you know this guy?<br />- Nah, I don't know him.
1631025 1632607 - John.<br />- Not now.
1632818 1635652 Hey, there's this cop<br />scoping for you. Check it out.
1639116 1641028 - He's right over there.<br />- Split, man.
1641243 1643155 - Just go.<br />- Yeah.
1648417 1649407 I saw that kid...
1649627 1650743 Hey!
1665100 1666807 Hey! You're not supposed to be in here!
1684995 1686531 Hey!
1692670 1693706 Get down.
1764867 1766654 Mister, are you all right?
1784511 1785547 Come on!
1825803 1827135 Goddamn!
2106292 2108659 Okay. Time out. Stop the bike.
2108878 2110790 Time out. Come on, stop the bike.
2124644 2127227 Holy shit.<br />Now, don't take this the wrong way.
2127438 2129475 - But you are a Terminator, right?<br />- Yes.
2129690 2133525 - Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.<br />- No?
2144247 2148332 Holy shit! You're really real.
2150753 2152210 I mean...
2154882 2159252 You're like a machine underneath,<br />right? But sort of alive outside?
2159470 2161257 I'm a cybernetic organism:
2161472 2164010 living tissue over metal endoskeleton.
2178906 2180943 This is intense.
2181159 2183867 Get a grip, John. Okay.
2186539 2188531 You're not here to kill me.
2188749 2192663 I figured that part out for myself.<br />So what's the deal?
2192879 2195462 My mission is to protect you.
2195673 2198165 Yeah? Who sent you?
2199468 2200458 You did.
2200678 2202010 35 years from now,
2202221 2205589 you reprogrammed me to be<br />your protector here, in this time.
2205808 2208551 Oh, this is deep.
2210646 2213684 So this other guy,<br />he's a Terminator like you, right?
2213900 2217359 Not like me. A T-1000, advanced prototype.
2219071 2223486 - More advanced than you are?<br />- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
2224410 2226823 - What the hell does that mean?<br />- Liquid metal.
2228581 2229697 Where are we going?
2229916 2233117 We have to get out of the city<br />immediately and avoid the authorities.
2233920 2236583 Listen, I got to stop by my house.<br />I want to pick up some stuff.
2236797 2240757 Negative. The T-1000 would definitely<br />try to reacquire you there.
2240968 2243631 - You sure?<br />- I would.
2254398 2256981 Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...
2259320 2260652 ...but I gotta warn them.
2260863 2263196 Shit! You got a quarter?
2272041 2274909 - Hello.<br />- 'Janelle, it's me.'
2275127 2277335 - John?<br />- 'Yeah. Is everything all right?'
2277546 2279833 - Are you guys okay?<br />- 'Sure, honey, everything's okay.'
2280049 2283042 - Are you all right?<br />- 'Yeah, I'm fine.'
2283261 2286720 John, it's late.<br />I was beginning to worry about you.
2286931 2289469 If you hurry home, we can sit down<br />and have dinner together.
2289684 2291095 I'm making beef stew.
2291310 2293393 Something's wrong. She's never this nice.
2293604 2295971 John, where are you?
2296190 2298933 What the hell is the goddamn dog barking at?
2299151 2302269 Hey, shut up, you worthless piece of shit!
2302488 2303820 The dog's really barking.
2304031 2306114 You were gonna tell the kid<br />to get rid of that fucking mutt.
2310162 2312579 John, honey, it's late.<br />Please don't make me worry.
2312799 2314815 Could he already be there?
2315925 2319373 - Honey, are you okay?<br />- I'm right here. I'm fine.
2319588 2321079 'Are you sure you're all right?'
2321299 2324087 - What's the dog's name?<br />- Max.
2324719 2326927 Janelle, what's wrong with Wolfie?
2327138 2329596 I can hear him barking. Is he okay?
2329807 2332470 Wolfie's fine, honey. Wolfie's just fine.
2333811 2335302 Where are you?
2337106 2338972 Your foster parents are dead.
2375978 2377970 No, no. I need a minute here.
2378189 2382354 You're telling me that this thing<br />can imitate anything it touches?
2382568 2384901 Anything it samples by physical contact.
2385112 2386899 Get real.
2387114 2390733 It could disguise itself<br />as a pack of cigarettes?
2390951 2392613 No, only an object of equal size.
2392828 2395241 Why not just become a bomb<br />or something to get me?
2395456 2397493 It can't form complex machines.
2397708 2399665 Guns and explosives<br />have chemicals, moving parts.
2399877 2401163 It doesn't work that way.
2401379 2404167 - But it can form solid metal shapes.<br />- Like what?
2404382 2406374 Knives and stabbing weapons.
2407301 2409634 These were taken<br />by a video surveillance camera
2409845 2413213 at the West Highland Police Station in 1984.
2414725 2417638 He killed 17 police officers that night.
2419271 2421388 Men with families...
2422775 2424357 ...children.
2425861 2430196 These were taken at a mall in Reseda today.
2431575 2435489 Miss Connor, we know<br />you know who this guy is.
2437665 2441955 Look, I just sat here and told you<br />that your son is missing.
2442169 2444035 That the foster parents have been murdered.
2444255 2446497 We know this guy's involved.
2447716 2451551 Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br />Don't you care?
2455933 2462055 - We're wasting our time. Let's go.<br />- Sorry, guys.
2462273 2466475 She's grown more and more disconnected<br />from reality as time goes on.
2466694 2468356 I'm afraid she can't help us now.
2468571 2472235 If she clears at all and can<br />give us anything, I'll call you.
2472450 2473782 Sure.
2473993 2476736 Douglas, take her back to her room, please.
2476954 2478035 Yes, sir.
2479707 2481744 Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
2481959 2486920 You see, we spent a lot of time<br />in Nicaragua and places like that.
2489049 2492668 For a while there, she was with<br />this crazy ex-Green Beret guy
2492970 2494086 running guns.
2494305 2497139 Then there were some other guys.
2497349 2499090 She'd shack up with anybody<br />she could learn from
2499310 2502519 so she could teach me how to be<br />this great military leader.
2504398 2506310 Then she gets busted.
2506525 2510018 It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's<br />a psycho. Didn't you know?"
2512364 2516233 It's like everything I'd been brought up<br />to believe was all made-up bullshit.
2516452 2518865 I hated her for that.
2522208 2524825 But everything she said was true.
2526212 2528078 She knew.
2530341 2532333 And nobody believed her.
2534178 2536010 Not even me.
2538057 2539798 Listen, we gotta get her out of there.
2540017 2543351 Negative. The T-1000's<br />highest probability for success now
2543562 2546471 will be to copy Sarah Connor and wait<br />for you to make contact with her.
2546690 2548647 Great. What happens to her?
2548859 2551602 Typically, the subject<br />being copied is terminated.
2551820 2554779 Shit! Why didn't you tell me?<br />We gotta go right now!
2554990 2557107 Negative. It's not a mission priority.
2557326 2559318 Fuck you! She's a priority to me!
2561205 2564039 Goddamn it! What's your problem? Damn it!
2564250 2567084 - Help! Help!<br />- This does not help our mission.
2567294 2569627 Get this psycho off of me! Help!
2569838 2572751 Help! I'm being kidnapped!<br />Get this psycho off of me!
2572967 2573878 Let me go!
2578556 2582175 - Why the hell did you do that?<br />- Because you told me to.
2585020 2586682 What?
2591527 2593484 You have to do what I say, huh?
2593696 2595779 That's one of my mission parameters.
2597074 2600567 Prove it. Stand on one foot.
2602788 2604120 Yes!
2606333 2609917 Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
2611422 2614130 - You okay, kid?<br />- Take a hike, bozo.
2614341 2618756 - Let's get outta here, man.<br />- Fuck you, you little dipshit!
2619597 2621179 Dipshit?
2623225 2625217 Put your leg down.
2625436 2630101 - Did you call <i>moi</i> a dipshit?<br />- Just trying to help this punk.
2630316 2632558 Grab this guy.<br />I can't believe he called me...
2632776 2635393 Agh! God! Get him off of me!
2635613 2638651 Now who's the dipshit, you jock douche bag?
2638866 2640073 Get off me!
2646290 2647406 No!
2648667 2650954 Put the gun down, now!
2651170 2654334 - Get outta here!<br />- Come on. Let's split!
2661347 2663179 Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!
2663390 2665382 Of course. I'm a Terminator.
2667728 2670266 Listen to me very carefully, okay?
2670481 2673690 You're not a Terminator anymore, all right?
2673901 2675984 You got that?
2676195 2678528 You just can't go around killing people.
2678739 2679604 Why?
2680574 2682736 What do you mean, why? Cos you can't.
2682951 2683782 Why?
2683994 2686657 Because you just can't. Trust me on this.
2692711 2696170 Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.
2696382 2699796 And I order you to help me.
2845531 2846567 Hi!
2846782 2850822 - You have a Sarah Connor here?<br />- You're running late, aren't you?
2851036 2853278 They've been in there for an hour.
2853497 2855830 Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.
2857709 2860326 Oh, here come your friends now.
2880023 2881935 Well, that was productive.
2923400 2926393 - Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?<br />- No, thanks.
2927154 2928144 How 'bout a beer?
2928363 2929774 Yeah, right!
2953847 2957306 - Hey, I got a full house.<br />- That's good, Lewis.
2957517 2959429 Must be my lucky day.
3102120 3104487 I think you're right about number 24.
3104706 3107414 Increase the medication to 250 milligrams.
3107626 3109834 - Same time?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3125398 3126812 You!
3130357 3132144 You broke my arm.
3132359 3134942 There are 215 bones in the human body.
3135153 3137691 That's one. Now, don't move.
3143703 3145365 What are you gonna do?
3149000 3151037 Why do we stop now?
3152379 3156089 You gotta promise me<br />you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
3156299 3158757 - Right.<br />- Swear?
3158969 3160335 What?
3160554 3163547 Just put up your hand and say,<br />"I swear I won't kill anyone."
3164724 3168593 - I swear I will not kill anyone.<br />- All right. Let's go.
3175777 3179521 Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,<br />Monday through Friday.
3183827 3187571 - What the hell are you doing?<br />- You son of a bitch! You shot me!
3189249 3190706 You crazy bastard!
3194430 3197247 Don't shoot me again. Don't kill me.
3201052 3202543 He'll live.
3217402 3219394 Son of a bitch!
3220530 3222192 Let's try to remain calm.
3222407 3224194 Open it, or he'll be dead<br />before he hits the floor.
3224409 3226321 There's no way, Connor. Let him go.
3226536 3228653 - Open the door.<br />- It ain't gonna happen.
3228872 3230704 Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.
3230916 3232532 It won't work, Sarah. You're no killer.
3232751 3234083 I don't believe you can do it.
3234294 3235535 You're already dead, Silberman.
3235754 3237165 Everybody dies. You know I believe it.
3237380 3240999 - So don't fuck with me!<br />- Open the door. Open the door.
3247307 3249515 Back off!
3249726 3251012 Get back!
3251228 3253015 I'll pump him full of this shit. I swear!
3254898 3256434 Don't move!
3257776 3260735 - Drop the shit!<br />- Do it! Do it!
3261321 3263608 Get in the office. On the floor, face down.
3263823 3264904 Not you!
3265116 3266607 Open the door.
3269621 3271863 On the floor. Hold it open. Face the wall!
3289099 3290590 Get her! Get her!
3316835 3318371 Sarah!
3318586 3321420 - Hurry up! Open the door!<br />- The door's locked!
3322424 3324381 Let's go! Open it!
3324592 3325378 Get the other door!
3327012 3328844 - She broke it off.<br />- Open it!
3334394 3336556 Let's go around! Come on! Move it!
3361963 3363249 No!
3363465 3364797 No!
3366885 3369844 - No!<br />- Mom, wait!
3370055 3371341 Mom!
3376978 3380517 - Come back here!<br />- No! No!
3381149 3382230 No!
3382442 3383933 - Help her!<br />- Wait here.
3384152 3385643 Hurry up!
3385862 3387819 He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!
3388031 3389112 Hold her.
3390825 3392361 He'll kill us all!
3414015 3416257 Mom, are you okay? Mom!
3420980 3423267 Come with me if you want to live.
3423483 3425691 It's okay, Mom. He's here to help. It's okay.
3450510 3451626 Go.
3484127 3486494 What the fuck is it?<br />What the fuck is going on?
3501436 3502768 Get down.
3519370 3521077 No! Mom!
3539224 3540590 Out of the car!
3542143 3543179 Right now!
3568002 3569664 Go!
3580098 3581134 I'm out.
3588106 3589847 - Come on.<br />- Here.
3592569 3594481 Reload.
3603580 3605412 Last one!
3612547 3614163 Hang on.
3640533 3641774 Ready!
3647373 3648705 John!
3655798 3657414 Here, drive.
3711104 3713096 He's not back there.<br />There's nobody behind us.
3713314 3715476 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah.
3717735 3721024 - Can you even see anything?<br />- I see everything.
3724200 3725657 Cool.
3729414 3730950 Come here.
3737088 3738704 I said I was okay.
3739674 3742633 John, it was stupid of you to go there.
3743761 3745878 God damnit! You have to be smarter than that.
3746097 3747554 You almost got yourself killed.
3748933 3750515 What were you thinking?
3751561 3754053 You cannot risk yourself, even for me.
3754272 3755604 Do you understand?
3755815 3759980 You're too important. Do you understand?
3762989 3763979 But...
3765825 3769409 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
3770788 3772996 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
3780339 3781830 What's wrong with your eyes?
3784010 3785342 Nothing.
3795354 3797641 So, what's your story?
3808242 3809278 You okay?
3809494 3810905 Fine.
3812830 3815914 Say, that's a nice bike.
3837939 3840056 Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.
3847907 3850866 Listen, do you know what you're doing?
3851077 3853911 I have detailed files on human anatomy.
3854872 3859833 I bet! Makes you<br />a more efficient killer, right?
3860044 3861080 Correct.
3867426 3869133 Does it hurt when you get shot?
3870471 3873555 I sense injuries.<br />The data could be called "pain".
3876269 3878056 John, help me with the light.
3878271 3880103 - Will these heal up?<br />- Yes.
3880314 3884729 Good. If you can't pass for a human,<br />you're not much good to us.
3884944 3887903 How long do you live? I mean, last. Whatever.
3888114 3890777 120 years with my existing power cell.
3890992 3893826 Can you learn stuff that<br />you haven't been programmed with,
3894036 3895698 so you can be...
3896789 3901284 ...you know, more human,<br />and not such a dork all the time?
3903796 3907380 My CPU is a neural net processor,<br />a learning computer.
3907592 3911302 The more contact I have with humans,<br />the more I learn.
3911512 3913128 Cool.
3944587 3946078 Are we learning yet?
3959101 3962060 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
3965983 3967815 Just head south.
3976369 3977826 Keep it under 65.
3978037 3980654 - We don't wanna be pulled over.<br />- Affirmative.
3981499 3986369 No, no, no. You gotta listen<br />to the way people talk.
3986587 3990001 You don't say "affirmative"<br />or some shit like that.
3990216 3992378 You say, <i>"No problemo."</i>
3992593 3996382 And if someone comes up to you<br />with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"
3996597 4000716 And if you want to shine them on,<br />it's <i>"Hasta la vista,</i> baby."
4001602 4003343 <i>Hasta la vista,</i> baby.
4004397 4006104 Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."
4006315 4009103 And if someone gets upset,<br />you say, "Chill out."
4009318 4013733 - Or you can do combinations.<br />- Chill out, dick-wad.
4014657 4016569 That's great. See? You're getting it.
4016784 4018696 <i>No problemo.</i>
4033426 4035213 Want some of my fries?
4045521 4049014 - Need any help?<br />- No.
4049233 4052601 - I got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4052820 4054652 I did! I came round here and I got you!
4054864 4058528 No, you didn't!
4059410 4061527 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4064331 4065572 People, I mean.
4068586 4070578 It's in your nature to destroy yourselves.
4071756 4074373 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4074592 4077460 Break it up before<br />I wring both of your necks.
4079597 4083932 I need to know how Skynet gets built,<br />who's responsible.
4084143 4087602 The man most directly responsible<br />is Miles Bennett Dyson.
4088522 4089638 Who is that?
4089857 4092975 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
4096280 4097896 Why him?
4098115 4101817 In a few months he creates<br />a revolutionary type of microprocessor.
4102578 4105821 - Go on. Then what?<br />- In three years,
4106040 4109450 Cyberdyne will become the largest supplier<br />of military computer systems.
4110461 4113249 All Stealth bombers are upgraded<br />with Cyberdyne computers,
4113464 4114796 becoming fully unmanned.
4115007 4118125 Afterwards, they fly<br />with a perfect operational record.
4118344 4120711 The Skynet Funding bill is passed.
4120930 4124219 The system goes on-line on August 4, 1997.
4124433 4127346 Human decisions are removed<br />from strategic defence.
4127561 4130269 Skynet begins to learn at a geometric rate.
4130481 4134646 It becomes self-aware at 02:14am<br />Eastern time, August 29.
4135820 4138153 In a panic, they try to pull the plug.
4139490 4141698 - Skynet fights back.<br />- Yes.
4141909 4144401 It launches its missiles<br />against the targets in Russia.
4144620 4147658 Why attack Russia?<br />Aren't they our friends now?
4147873 4150115 Because Skynet knows<br />that the Russian counterattack
4150334 4152121 will eliminate its enemies over here.
4152336 4153827 Jesus!
4157258 4158419 How much do you know about Dyson?
4160678 4162419 I have detailed files.
4163806 4165547 I wanna know everything.
4166976 4170936 What he looks like,<br />where he lives, everything.
4199550 4201166 Wait in the car.
4219737 4221603 Enrique!
4221822 4224155 Are you here?
4239590 4240922 You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
4243344 4244939 And you...
4246839 4249186 are always like a snake.
4251268 4253260 It's great to see you, Connor!
4253479 4254515 I told you I would be back.
4254730 4257438 I knew you would. It's good to see you.
4257650 4258481 Jolanda!
4258692 4261901 Get out here, we got company.<br />And bring some tequila.
4262112 4265230 - Hey, big John. <i>¿Cómo te va?</i><br />- What's up?
4265449 4267156 CONTINUES IN SPANISH) Who's this big guy?
4267368 4272329 He's cool, Enrique.<br />He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.
4272539 4274371 Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
4274583 4276996 Uncle Bob, huh?
4277586 4280078 Okay. Okay!
4281465 4282546 How are you?
4282758 4286047 How are you? You've grown so much.
4286262 4287753 Drink?
4292059 4293300 Uncle Bob?
4294395 4298389 Hey, Sarita! You're pretty famous,<br />all over the goddamn TV.
4298607 4300745 Pictures of you, John, your big friend here.
4300860 4303568 Cops are going nuts looking for you.
4306991 4308107 I just came for my stuff.
4308325 4310783 I need clothes, food and one of your trucks.
4310995 4312952 How about the fillings<br />out of my fucking teeth?
4313163 4315655 Now, Enrique!
4316709 4320498 - You two, you're on weapons detail.<br />- Come on. Let's go.
4341400 4343813 One thing about my mom...
4345654 4347771 ...she always plans ahead.
4358334 4359290 Excellent.
4370137 4373676 This is my best truck I got,<br />but the starter motor's gone.
4373891 4375678 You got time to change it out?
4375893 4378931 Yeah. I'm gonna wait till dark<br />to cross the border.
4381607 4385896 See, I grew up in places like this,<br />so I just thought that's how people lived,
4386111 4390606 riding around in helicopters,<br />learning how to blow shit up.
4395496 4397112 That's definitely you.
4408759 4411342 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung around with were geeks,
4411553 4415217 but there was this one guy,<br />he was kinda cool.
4415432 4418596 - He taught me engines.<br />- Hold here.
4419561 4421974 Mom screwed it up, of course.
4422189 4424226 She'd always tell 'em about Judgment Day
4424441 4426808 and me being this world leader.
4427611 4431605 - That'd be all she wrote.<br />- Torque wrench, please.
4434034 4435115 Here.
4436161 4440576 - I wish I could've met my real dad.<br />- You will.
4440791 4445377 Yeah, I guess. When I'm, like, 45, I think.
4446672 4449836 I sent him back through time to 1984.
4450676 4451917 Man!
4453637 4455924 He hasn't even been born yet.
4457683 4459640 It messes with your head.
4462271 4464888 - The other bolt.<br />- Oh. Here.
4471864 4475278 Mom and him were only together for one night.
4475492 4480658 She still loves him, I guess.<br />I see her crying sometimes.
4480873 4485287 She denies it totally, of course,<br />like she got something stuck in her eye.
4489548 4491039 Why do you cry?
4492176 4493963 - You mean people?<br />- Yeah.
4494178 4496636 I don't know. We just cry.
4497598 4499931 You know, when it hurts.
4506231 4511226 - Pain causes it?<br />- Er... no. It's different.
4511445 4514404 It's when there's nothing wrong<br />with you, but you hurt anyways.
4514615 4516426 - Get it?<br />- No.
4517409 4518991 All right, my man!
4519203 4522412 <i>- No problemo.</i><br />- Give me five.
4524958 4526870 Just put out your hand, like this.
4528253 4531963 All right! Now hit me.<br />Give me five. Do the same thing.
4532374 4534011 All right!
4537137 4539470 Okay, that's good. Up high! High five!
4540599 4541715 Five low.
4542634 4544125 Too slow.
4546605 4548722 I'm just kidding. One more time.
4548941 4551024 Good. Now try it. Good!
4551235 4552976 Now do me. Give me five.
4554696 4556688 'Watching John with the machine,
4556907 4559069 it was suddenly so clear.
4559284 4562243 'The Terminator would never stop.
4562454 4566118 'It would never leave him<br />and it would never hurt him,
4566333 4569747 'never shout at him or get drunk and hit him
4569962 4572249 'or say it was too busy<br />to spend time with him.
4573298 4578009 'It would always be there<br />and it would die to protect him.
4579763 4582756 'Of all the would-be fathers<br />who came and went over the years,
4582975 4587310 'this thing, this machine,<br />was the only one who measured up.
4588313 4592728 'In an insane world,<br />it was the sanest choice.'
4625767 4630603 Come here, darling.
4690374 4692582 Hey, let's try this one.
4697964 4699500 There we go.
4805739 4808152 She said you go south<br />with him like you planned.
4808366 4811359 - She'll meet you tomorrow.<br />- Mom!
4811578 4813319 Mom, wait!
4828804 4830511 "No fate".
4831848 4834056 "No fate, but what we make."
4836228 4837844 My father told her this.
4840857 4845443 I mean, I made him memorise it<br />in the future as a message to her.
4846696 4851862 Never mind.<br />Now, okay, the whole thing goes...
4852077 4854694 The future's not set.
4854913 4858327 There's no fate,<br />but what we make for ourselves.
4858542 4863037 - She intends to change the future.<br />- Yeah, I guess.
4864506 4866213 Oh, shit!
4866424 4868211 - Dyson.<br />- Yeah.
4868426 4871794 Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
4872013 4873879 She's gonna blow him away.
4874099 4875965 Come on! Let's go!
4876184 4877846 Let's go! Come on!
4888613 4891606 - This is tactically dangerous.<br />- Drive faster.
4891825 4895569 The T-1000 has the same files<br />that I do. It knows what I know.
4895787 4900282 - It might anticipate this move.<br />- I don't care. We gotta stop her.
4900500 4902867 Killing Dyson might prevent the war.
4903086 4904793 I don't care!
4905005 4906792 Haven't you learned anything yet?
4907007 4909169 Haven't you figured out<br />why you can't kill people?
4915390 4917803 Danny, I told you to go to bed.<br />I'm not kidding.
4918018 4921261 Just a couple of minutes, Mom!
4929738 4931946 Danny, your time is up!
4932157 4934945 Come brush your teeth and get to bed.
4963688 4964895 Danny!
4976660 4980404 - Daddy!<br />- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!
4982123 4983159 Miles?
4986920 4988331 Miles!
4988546 4990833 - Tarissa, run!<br />- Oh, my God!
4998056 4999968 Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!
5000183 5001299 Run!
5001518 5003134 Oh, Jesus! Miles!
5022497 5024580 - Daddy!<br />- Danny! Danny!
5024791 5028284 - Nobody fucking move!<br />- Don't hurt my daddy!
5028503 5032167 Get down on the floor, bitch. Get down now!
5032382 5034123 Get out of the way.
5034342 5035924 Don't hurt him!
5037637 5039173 Get on the floor now!
5041474 5043932 Just let the boy go.
5044144 5046978 Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
5047188 5049646 It's all your fault, motherfucker.
5049858 5051975 - It's all your fault!<br />- What?
5052193 5054185 I'm not gonna let you do it.
5072839 5073955 Shhh!
5078219 5079426 Shhh.
5106289 5108656 Shit! We're too late!
5112879 5113869 Check them.
5117592 5121085 Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?
5122055 5123591 Look at me.
5125600 5127557 I almost...
5127769 5129681 I almost...
5139489 5143529 It'll be okay. It's gonna be okay.<br />We'll figure something out. Okay?
5145495 5146827 I promise.
5150708 5155874 - You came here to stop me.<br />- Yeah, I did.
5158967 5160754 I love you, John.
5162679 5164762 I always have.
5166224 5168056 I know.
5174524 5176561 Deep penetration.
5178319 5180106 No shattered bone.
5180321 5183109 You hold here. The pressure<br />should stop the bleeding.
5194043 5197207 - Who are you people?<br />- Show him.
5200508 5204548 Danny, I want you to come with me<br />right now. Show me your room.
5217609 5220727 Oh, God! No!
5233208 5235495 Oh, my God!
5244761 5246252 Oh, my God.
5246471 5248929 Now, listen to me very carefully.
5251351 5254719 Nuclear winter effects<br />caused massive cooling...
5254938 5258978 'Dyson listened while<br />the Terminator laid it all down.
5259192 5262776 'Skynet. Judgment Day.
5262987 5266025 'The history of things to come.
5266991 5272278 'It's not every day that you find out<br />you're responsible for three billion deaths.
5272497 5275080 'He took it pretty well.'
5276501 5279084 I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
5285593 5290179 You're judging me<br />on things I haven't even done yet.
5293935 5296552 How were we supposed to know?
5298648 5300264 Yeah!
5300483 5301974 Right.
5302902 5305986 How were you supposed to know?
5306197 5309781 Fucking men like you built the hydrogen bomb.
5309993 5314203 Men like you thought it up.
5318001 5321039 You think you're so creative.
5321254 5324292 You don't know what it's like<br />to really create something,
5324507 5328091 to create a life,<br />to feel it growing inside you.
5328303 5330545 All you know how to create<br />is death and destruction.
5330763 5332129 Mom!
5333099 5336718 We need to be a little more<br />constructive here. Okay?
5336936 5338893 We still have to stop this<br />from happening, don't we?
5339105 5340812 But I thought...
5342025 5345860 Aren't we changing things right now,<br />changing the way it goes?
5346070 5349609 That's right. There's no way<br />I'm gonna finish the new processor.
5349824 5352487 Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.
5352702 5356286 - I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.<br />- That's not good enough.
5356497 5359490 - No one must follow your work.<br />- Right.
5360585 5364420 All right, then we have to destroy<br />all the stuff at the lab:
5364630 5369045 the files, the disk drives,<br />everything, everything here.
5369886 5372720 Everything. I don't care.
5374724 5375510 The chip.
5376142 5377678 - Do you know about the chip?<br />- What chip?
5377894 5379385 They keep it in a vault at Cyberdyne.
5379604 5380845 It must be from the other one like you.
5381064 5385434 - The CPU from the first Terminator.<br />- Son of a bitch! I knew it!
5385651 5388234 They told us not to ask where they got it.
5388446 5390654 Those lying motherfuckers.
5390865 5392527 It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.
5392742 5396444 I mean, it was smashed, it didn't work,<br />but it gave us ideas,
5396662 5399530 took us in new directions,<br />things we would've never th...
5401793 5403785 All my work was based on it.
5404003 5405665 It must be destroyed.
5408007 5410966 Can you get us in? Past security?
5411177 5414090 I think so, yeah. When?
5418142 5419098 Now?
5423356 5426019 'The future, always so clear to me,
5426234 5429147 'had become like a black highway at night.
5429362 5434903 'We were in uncharted territory now,<br />making up history as we went along.'
5470361 5474856 Hi. Er... Carl, right?
5476617 5478449 Friends from out of town.<br />I just thought I'd...
5478870 5479701 Hi!
5480121 5481987 ...take 'em upstairs and show 'em around.
5482206 5485370 Mr Dyson, you know the rules<br />concerning visitors in the lab.
5485585 5487577 I need written authorisation...
5488796 5492506 - I insist.<br />- Don't even think about it.
5503478 5505014 Come on. It's okay.
5506439 5509606 It takes two keys to open the vault.<br />They have to be turned simultaneously.
5509817 5512480 The other one is in a locker<br />at the security station.
5514113 5515354 Gibbons?
5518618 5523283 Gibbons! Come on, man!<br />You can't leave the desk like that!
5525583 5526824 Gibbons!
5528336 5529622 Oh, shit.
5547605 5549642 My card should access this.
5553361 5555478 - What? What is it?<br />- Damn it.
5556739 5558526 The silent alarm's been tripped.
5564664 5567452 It's neutralised all the codes<br />in the entire building.
5567667 5571251 Nothing will open anywhere now.<br />We have to abort.
5572505 5573916 No.
5575633 5578797 We go all the way. Okay?
5581097 5584761 You guys get started on the lab.<br />I can open this.
5584976 5586387 I think it's that guy from the mall.
5586602 5587513 It is!
5587728 5589890 It's him and the woman.
5591232 5594066 Look, just send everything<br />you got in the area right now.
5596654 5599897 I have a personal entry code<br />for the lab. It may still work.
5604579 5606741 - It's no good.<br />- Let me try mine.
5612003 5613960 John, fire in the hold!
5626142 5630807 Wait! You can't go in there.<br />The fire set off the halon system.
5638112 5640445 You have to wait until the gas clears.
5643075 5644191 Put this on.
5658466 5660708 All right, let's get to work.
