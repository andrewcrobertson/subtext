112070 114493 <i>on August 29, 1997.</i>
115657 120537 <i>The survivors of the nuclear fire<br />called the war Judgment Day.</i>
120911 123710 <i>They lived only to face<br />a new nightmare:</i>
123914 125882 <i>the war against the machines.</i>
204199 207829 <i>The computer which controlled<br />the machines, Skynet,</i>
208036 211005 <i>sent two Terminators<br />back through time.</i>
211205 214835 <i>Their mission, to destroy the leader<br />of the human resistance,</i>
215042 217670 <i>John Connor, my son.</i>
221966 225971 <i>The first Terminator was programmed<br />to strike at me in the year 1984,</i>
226178 228726 <i>before John was born.</i>
228930 230432 <i>It failed.</i>
230640 235191 <i>The second was set to strike at John<br />himself when he was still a child.</i>
239482 243532 <i>As before, the resistance was able<br />to send a lone warrior,</i>
243737 245909 <i>a protector for John.</i>
246113 249458 <i>It was just a question of which one<br />of them would reach him first.</i>
504273 507243 I need your clothes, your boots<br />and your motorcycle.

731613 733035 Ugh!
789960 791337 John!
791544 794047 John, get in there and clean up<br />that pigsty of yours.
799469 801642 John!
806225 808193 Your foster parents<br />are kind of dicks, huh?
809061 811689 I swear, I have had it<br />with that goddamn kid.
811897 814400 - He won't even answer me anymore.<br />- Honey, move.
814608 817407 Would you get off your butt<br />and help me?
817611 820329 - Todd!<br />- What?
820530 823784 He hasn't cleaned that room of his<br />in a month.
823992 826916 Well, it's an emergency.<br />Hang on. I'll get right on it.
834711 836463 - Come on!<br />- John!
836671 839799 C'mon! Get your ass inside.<br />Do what your mother tells you.
841049 843643 She's not my mother, Todd.
870411 871879 This next patient is interesting.
872079 874547 I've been following<br />the case for years.
874748 876750 A 29-year-old female,
879169 881718 diagnosed as acute<br />schizo-affective disorder.
881921 883969 The usual indicators:<br />depression, anxiety,
884174 886723 violent acting out,<br />delusions of persecution.
893390 896519 The delusional architecture<br />is fairly unique.
896727 899571 She believes that a machine<br />called the Terminator,
899772 900989 which looked human, of course,
901190 903784 was sent back through time<br />to kill her.
903984 905110 That's original.
905319 908038 And also,<br />that the father of her child
908238 911081 was a soldier<br />sent back to protect her.
911282 913580 - No?<br />- He was from the future too.
913785 918586 The year 2029,<br />if I remember correctly.
918790 920667 And here we are.
921501 922548 Morning, Sarah.
927006 930851 Good morning, Dr Silberman.<br />How's the knee?
932761 934638 Fine, Sarah.
935847 941024 She, er... stabbed me in the kneecap<br />with my pen a few weeks ago.
941853 943196 Repeated escape attempts...
953531 955625 Let's move on, shall we?
955825 956667 Lewis.
956867 959468 I don't like to see the patients<br />disrupting their rooms like this.
959662 962757 - See she takes her Thorazine.<br />- Sure. I'll take care of it.
975510 977387 Time to take you meds, Connor.
978346 979939 You take it.
980432 983310 You gotta be good.<br />You're up for review this afternoon.
983934 985311 I'm not taking it.
985894 988773 - I don't want any trouble.<br />- Ain't no trouble...
995154 996121 Yeah, zap her.
1007081 1008503 Last call, sugar.
1014797 1016140 Sweet dreams.
1046452 1048454 Are you the legal guardian<br />of John Connor?
1049246 1051624 That's right, Officer.<br />What's he done now?
1052458 1055176 - Could I speak with him, please?<br />- You could if he were here.
1055376 1058095 He took off on his bike this morning<br />so he could be anywhere.
1058296 1061800 - Do you have a photograph of John?<br />- Yeah. Hold on.
1064761 1067105 You gonna tell me what this is about?
1067305 1069182 I just need to ask him<br />a few questions.
1071643 1074646 He's a good-looking boy.<br />Do you mind if I keep this picture?
1074853 1078107 No, go on. There was a guy here<br />this morning looking for him, too.
1078315 1080033 Yeah, a big guy on a bike.
1080234 1082157 Has that got something<br />to do with this?
1084571 1088417 No. I wouldn't worry about him.
1089743 1092336 Thanks for your cooperation.
1093579 1096082 Please insert<br />your stolen card now.
1103756 1105349 PIN number.
1106717 1108184 Hurry up.<br />This is taking too long.
1108385 1109762 Go, baby. Go, baby.
1111471 1112814 All right!
1113014 1116518 - PIN number 9003.<br />- Where'd you learn this stuff from?
1116726 1119149 From my mom.<br />My real mom, I mean.
1120313 1123442 Withdraw three-zero-zero bucks.
1123650 1126368 Come on, baby. Come on! Come on!
1126569 1128663 - Yes!<br />- Hey, it worked.
1128862 1132412 All right. Easy money. Come on!
1135035 1137037 Yes! Piece of cake.
1142626 1145424 - Is that her?<br />- Yes.
1145628 1149678 - She's pretty cool, huh?<br />- No, she's a complete psycho.
1149882 1153512 That's why she's at Pescadero.<br />It's a mental institute, OK?
1154387 1156264 She tried to blow up<br />a computer factory,
1156472 1157769 but she got shot and arrested.
1157974 1159442 No shit.
1160268 1162565 She's a total loser.
1162769 1165363 Come on.<br />Let's go spend some money.
1191631 1192757 Sarah.
1194467 1195810 Sarah, wake up.
1203850 1205022 Kyle?
1208229 1209230 You're dead.
1209773 1211320 Where's our son, Sarah?
1212400 1214494 They took him away from me.
1214819 1217947 - He's the target now.<br />- I know!
1218155 1220032 He's alone.<br />You have to protect him.
1220240 1221537 I know.
1222576 1224499 You tell me how I am supposed<br />to do that.
1225287 1226914 He doesn't even<br />believe me anymore.
1228165 1229257 I've lost him.
1229583 1231210 You're strong, Sarah.
1231543 1233762 - Stronger than you ever thought.<br />- No.
1235213 1236556 On your feet, soldier!
1238716 1241185 I love you. I always will.
1243805 1246649 - I need you.<br />- I'll always be with you.
1251104 1252776 Remember the message?
1254481 1255949 "The future is not set."
1257317 1260787 "There is no fate<br />but what we make for ourselves."
1281132 1282384 Stay with me.
1283592 1286015 There's not much time left<br />in the world, Sarah.
1293768 1295486 Kyle, don't go!
1307698 1308950 Kyle!
1381601 1384855 It's like a giant strobe light,
1385563 1387440 burning right to my eyes.
1391986 1394080 Somehow I can still see.
1405707 1408802 We know<br />the dream's the same every night.
1409169 1412343 - Why do I have to...<br />- Please continue.
1416259 1418762 Children look like burnt paper.
1420513 1421981 Black.
1422932 1424559 Not moving.
1426477 1429321 And then the blast wave hits them.
1438280 1440703 And they fly apart like leaves.
1442659 1447836 Dreams of cataclysm,<br />the end of the world are very common.
1449832 1453928 It's not a dream, you moron.<br />It's real.
1454128 1457883 - I know the date it happens.<br />- I'm sure it feels very real to you.
1458090 1463187 On August 29, 1997, it's gonna feel<br />pretty fuckin' real to you, too!
1464471 1466849 Anybody not wearing<br />two-million sunblock
1467057 1469559 is gonna have<br />a real bad day. Get it?
1470059 1472778 God! You think you're safe and alive.
1472979 1475152 You're already dead. Everybody!
1475356 1477779 Him. You. You're dead already.
1477984 1480737 This whole place,<br />everything you see is gone!
1480945 1483915 You're the one<br />living in a fucking dream, Silberman!
1484115 1485036 Cos I know it happened!
1485116 1486708 It happened!
1498003 1499926 I feel much better now.
1501131 1502883 Clearer.
1503091 1508438 Yes, your attitude has been<br />much improved lately.
1517647 1519991 It's helped me to have a goal,
1520775 1523243 something to look forward to.
1523443 1524490 What is that?
1525362 1530835 Well, you said that if I showed<br />improvement after six months,
1531034 1533583 you would transfer me<br />to the minimum security wing
1533787 1536882 and I could have visitors.
1538166 1541465 Well, it's been six months and...
1543379 1545507 I was looking forward<br />to seeing my son.
1546715 1548217 I see.
1551387 1556484 Let's go back to what you were saying<br />about those Terminator machines.
1556684 1559937 Now you think they don't exist?
1560144 1562363 They don't exist.
1562563 1564156 I know that now.
1564357 1566155 But you've told me<br />on many occasions
1566359 1569704 about how you crushed one<br />in a hydraulic press.
1571072 1574076 If I had, there would have been<br />some evidence.
1574283 1576580 They would have found something<br />at the factory.
1576785 1578787 I see.
1578996 1582842 So, you don't believe any more<br />that the company covered it up?
1585002 1587471 No. Why would they?
1588380 1590633 Let's try a new position right there.
1590841 1595016 The neuronal sensors are correct,<br />because it works.
1595219 1597722 - Right.<br />- Those neurons are all centered.
1598597 1600599 Maybe<br />the inhibitor circuits failed...
1600808 1601900 Mr Dyson?
1602727 1605776 Mr Dyson, the materials team<br />is running another...
1606939 1608486 - Mr Dyson.<br />- Yes?
1608691 1611535 The materials team is running<br />another series this afternoon.
1611735 1614579 You have to sign for the...<br />Er... it.
1614779 1617703 - You have to sign it out.<br />- OK. Come on. I'll get it.
1619492 1620539 Mr Dyson,
1620744 1622777 I know I haven't been here long, but<br />I was wondering if you could tell me,
1622787 1624960 - I mean, if you know...<br />- Know what?
1625165 1627714 Well, if you know<br />where "it" came from.
1627917 1631216 I asked them that very same question<br />once. You know what they told me?
1631420 1632592 "Don't ask."
1639303 1641397 - Good morning, Mr Dyson.<br />- How's it going?
1642389 1643686 Insert key.
1643891 1646861 Left on three, two, one, turn.
1650772 1652533 - How are the wife and kids?<br />- Great. Thanks.
1652732 1653904 There you go.
1681718 1684186 So,<br />what do you think, Doctor?
1685262 1687014 I have shown improvement, haven't I?
1688390 1691439 Well, Sarah, here's the problem.
1692353 1693980 I know how smart you are.
1694730 1696731 I think you're just telling me<br />what I want to hear.
1697942 1700536 I don't think you really believe<br />what you're telling me today.
1700820 1702537 I think if I put you<br />in minimum security,
1702737 1704739 you'll just try to escape again.
1709828 1712422 You have to let me see my son.
1713373 1714875 Please.
1716376 1717673 Please.
1718962 1722841 He's in great danger.<br />He's naked without me.
1723048 1724800 If I could just make a phone call...
1725008 1727932 Afraid not. Not for a while.
1729805 1732149 I don't see any choice<br />but to recommend to the review board
1732349 1734647 that you stay here<br />for another six months.
1737979 1739731 I'll kill you, you son of a bitch!
1742316 1745570 - Get her off of me!<br />- You son of a bitch!
1745778 1748031 10cc of sodium amobarbital, stat!
1749699 1752460 - You don't know what you're doing!<br />- Get some restraints in here now!
1755079 1757706 You don't know what you're doing!
1762127 1764175 Model citizen.
1803541 1806135 You just missed him.<br />He was here 15 minutes ago.
1806336 1807929 He said he was going to the galleria?
1808129 1809176 Yeah.
1809380 1811006 The galleria?
1857050 1859428 I'm gonna get some quarters.<br />I'll be back, all right?
1874483 1877111 - Oh, no!<br />- Girls, do you know John Connor?
1877319 1878821 No.
1880990 1884869 - Hey, do you know this guy?<br />- Nah, I don't know him.
1891457 1893050 - John.<br />- Not now.
1893251 1896095 Hey, there's this cop<br />scoping for you. Check it out.
1899548 1901471 - He's right over there.<br />- Split, man.
1901675 1903598 - Just go.<br />- Yeah.
1908849 1909850 I saw that kid...
1910058 1911184 Hey!
1925531 1927249 Hey! You're not supposed<br />to be in here!
1945425 1946972 Hey!
1953099 1954145 Get down.
2025291 2027089 Mister, are you all right?
2044935 2045982 Come on!
2086224 2087567 Goddamn!
2290084 2291506 Agh!
2366698 2369075 OK. Time out. Stop the bike.
2369283 2371206 Time out. Come on, stop the bike.
2385047 2387641 Holy shit.<br />Now, don't take this the wrong way.
2387842 2389890 - But you are a Terminator, right?<br />- Yes.
2390094 2393940 - Cyberdyne Systems, Model 101.<br />- No?
2404649 2408745 Holy shit! You're really real.
2411156 2412624 I mean...
2415285 2419665 You're like a machine underneath,<br />right? But sort of alive outside?
2419873 2421670 I'm a cybernetic organism:
2421874 2424423 living tissue<br />over metal endoskeleton.
2439307 2441355 This is intense.
2441559 2444278 Get a grip, John. OK.
2446940 2448942 You're not here to kill me.
2449150 2453075 I figured that part out for myself.<br />So what's the deal?
2453279 2455873 My mission is to protect you.
2456074 2458576 Yeah? Who sent you?
2459868 2460869 You did.
2461078 2462421 35 years from now,
2462621 2466000 you reprogrammed me to be<br />your protector here, in this time.
2466208 2468961 Oh, this is deep.
2491566 2494409 This other guy,<br />he's a terminator like you, right?
2494609 2498079 Not like me.<br />A T-1000, advanced prototype.
2499781 2504207 - More advanced than you are?<br />- Yes. A mimetic poly-alloy.
2505120 2507543 - What the hell does that mean?<br />- Liquid metal.
2509291 2510417 Where are we going?
2510625 2512376 We have to get out of the city<br />immediately
2512585 2513837 and avoid the authorities.
2514628 2517302 Listen, I got to stop by my house.<br />I want to pick up some stuff.
2517506 2521477 Negative. The T-1000 would definitely<br />try to reacquire you there.
2521677 2524351 - You sure?<br />- I would.
2535106 2537700 Look, Todd and Janelle are dicks...
2540028 2541371 ...but I gotta warn them.
2541571 2543915 Shit! You got a quarter?
2552748 2555148 - Hello.<br />- <i>Janelle, it's me.</i>
2555834 2558134 - John?<br />- <i>Yeah. Is everything all right?</i>
2558200 2560498 - Are you guys OK?<br />- <i>Sure, honey, everything's OK.</i>
2560756 2563760 - Are you all right?<br />- <i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>
2563967 2567436 John, it's late.<br />Honey, I was beginning to worry about you.
2567637 2570186 If you hurry home, we can sit down<br />and have dinner together.
2570389 2571811 I'm making beef stew.
2571900 2574000 Something's wrong.<br />She's never this nice.
2574310 2576688 John, where are you?
2576850 2579550 What the hell is the<br />goddamn dog barking at?
2579857 2582985 Hey, shut up,<br />you worthless piece of shit!
2583193 2584536 The dog's really barking.
2584736 2587097 You were gonna tell the kid<br />to get rid of that fucking mutt.
2590867 2593495 John, honey, it's late.<br />Please don't make me worry.
2593700 2597705 - Could he already be there?<br />- Honey, are you OK?
2597916 2600066 I'm right here. I'm fine.
2600100 2601700 <i>John, are you sure you're all right?</i>
2602002 2604802 - What's the dog's name?<br />- Max.
2605422 2607641 Janelle, what's wrong<br />with Wolfie?
2607841 2610310 I can hear him barking. Is he OK?
2610511 2613185 Wolfie's fine, honey.<br />Wolfie's just fine.
2614515 2616017 Where are you?
2617810 2619686 Your foster parents are dead.
2656679 2658681 No, no. I need a minute here.
2658889 2663065 You're telling me that this thing<br />can imitate anything it touches?
2663269 2665613 Anything it samples<br />by physical contact.
2665813 2667611 Get real.
2667815 2671445 It could disguise itself<br />as a pack of cigarettes?
2671652 2673324 No, only an object of equal size.
2673528 2675951 Why not just become a bomb<br />or something to get me?
2676156 2679877 It can't form complex machines.<br />Guns, explosives have chemicals,
2680076 2682249 moving parts.<br />It doesn't work that way.
2682454 2684047 But it can form solid metal shapes.
2684247 2687091 - Like what?<br />- Knives and stabbing weapons.
2804735 2806988 These were taken<br />by a video surveillance camera
2807196 2810541 at the West Highland police station<br />in 1984.
2812034 2814958 He killed<br />17 police officers that night.
2816581 2818708 Men with families...
2820083 2821676 ...children.
2823170 2827516 These were taken at a mall<br />in Reseda today.
2828884 2832809 Miss Connor,<br />we know you know who this guy is.
2834972 2839273 Look, I just sat here and told you<br />that your son is missing.
2839476 2841353 That the foster parents<br />have been murdered.
2841562 2843815 We know this guy's involved.
2845024 2848870 Doesn't that mean anything to you?<br />Don't you care?
2853239 2859372 - We're wasting our time. Let's go.<br />- Sorry, guys.
2859579 2862082 She's grown more and more<br />disconnected from reality
2862290 2863792 as time goes on.
2864000 2865673 I'm afraid she can't help us now.
2865877 2869552 If she clears at all and can<br />give us anything, I'll call you.
2869756 2871098 Sure.
2871298 2874051 Douglas,<br />take her back to her room, please.
2874259 2875351 Yes, sir.
2877012 2879060 Come on, sweetheart. Let's go.
2879264 2884236 You see, we spent a lot of time<br />in Nicaragua and places like that.
2886355 2889984 For a while there, she was with<br />this crazy ex-Green Beret guy
2890274 2891400 running guns.
2891609 2894453 Then there were some other guys.
2894654 2896535 She'd shack up with anybody<br />she could learn from
2896614 2899834 so she could teach me how to be<br />this great military leader.
2901702 2903625 Then she gets busted.
2903829 2907332 It's like, "Sorry, kid. Your mom's<br />a psycho. Didn't you know?"
2909668 2911669 It's like everything<br />I'd been brought up to believe
2911795 2913547 was all made-up bullshit.
2913755 2916178 I hated her for that.
2919511 2922139 But everything she said was true.
2923515 2925391 She knew.
2927643 2929645 And nobody believed her.
2931480 2933323 Not even me.
2935359 2937111 Listen,<br />we gotta get her out of there.
2937319 2940664 Negative. The T-1000's<br />highest probability for success now
2940864 2942081 will be to copy Sarah Connor
2942283 2943923 and wait for you<br />to make contact with her.
2943992 2945960 Great. What happens to her?
2946160 2948913 Typically, the subject<br />being copied is terminated.
2949122 2952092 Shit! Why didn't you tell me?<br />We gotta go right now!
2952292 2954420 Negative.<br />It's not a mission priority.
2954627 2956629 Fuck you! She's a priority to me!
2958506 2961349 Goddamn it!<br />What's your problem? Damn it!
2961550 2964394 - Help! Help!<br />- This does not help our mission.
2964594 2966938 Get this psycho off of me! Help!
2967139 2970063 Help! I'm being kidnapped!<br />Get this psycho off of me!
2970267 2971189 Let me go!
2975856 2979485 - Why the hell did you do that?<br />- Because you told me to.
2982320 2983993 What?
2988826 2990794 You have to do what I say, huh?
2990995 2993089 That's one of my mission parameters.
2994373 2997876 Prove it. Stand on one foot.
3000086 3001429 Yes!
3003631 3007226 Cool. My own Terminator. Wow.
3008720 3011439 - You OK, kid?<br />- Take a hike, bozo.
3011639 3016064 - Let's get outta here, man.<br />- Fuck you, you little dipshit!
3016894 3018487 Dipshit?
3020522 3022524 Put your leg down.
3022733 3027433 - Did you call moi a dipshit?<br />- Just trying to help this punk.
3027613 3029866 Grab this guy.<br />I can't believe he called me...
3030074 3032701 Agh! God! Get him off of me!
3032909 3035958 Now who's the dipshit,<br />you jock douche bag?
3036162 3037379 Get off of me!
3043586 3044712 No!
3045963 3048261 Put the gun down, now!
3048466 3051639 - Get outta here!<br />- Come on. Let's split!
3058642 3060485 Jesus! You were gonna kill that guy!
3060685 3062687 Of course. I'm a Terminator.
3065023 3067572 Listen to me very carefully, OK?
3067776 3070995 You're not a Terminator anymore,<br />all right?
3071195 3073289 You got that?
3073489 3075833 You just can't go around<br />killing people.
3076033 3076909 Why?
3077868 3080041 What do you mean, why?<br />Cos you can't.
3080246 3081088 Why?
3081288 3083962 Because you just can't.<br />Trust me on this.
3090004 3093474 Look, I'm gonna go get my mom.
3093675 3097100 And I order you to help me.
3163282 3165034 Hm!
3242816 3243863 Hi!
3244067 3248117 - You have a Sarah Connor here?<br />- You're running late, aren't you?
3248320 3250573 They've been in there for an hour.
3250781 3253125 Hold on a second. I'll buzz you in.
3254994 3257622 Oh, here come your friends now.
3277307 3279230 Well, that was productive.
3320680 3323684 - Hey, Gwen, you want some coffee?<br />- No, thanks.
3324434 3325435 How 'bout a beer?
3325644 3327066 Yeah, right!
3351126 3354596 - Hey, I got a full house.<br />- That's good, Lewis.
3354797 3356719 Must be my lucky day.
3499391 3501768 I think you're right<br />about number 24.
3501976 3504695 Increase the medication<br />to 250 milligrams.
3504896 3507115 - Same time?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3521119 3523292 You!
3527626 3529424 You broke my arm.
3529628 3532222 There are 215 bones<br />in the human body.
3532422 3534971 That's one. Now, don't move.
3540972 3542645 What are you gonna do?
3546269 3548317 Why do we stop now?
3549647 3553368 You gotta promise me<br />you're not gonna kill anyone, right?
3553568 3556036 - Right.<br />- Swear?
3556236 3557613 What?
3557821 3560825 Just put up your hand and say,<br />"I swear I won't kill anyone."
3561992 3565872 - I swear I will not kill anyone.<br />- All right. Let's go.
3573043 3576798 Visiting hours is 10:00 to 4:00,<br />Monday through Friday.
3581093 3584848 - What the hell are you doing?<br />- You son of a bitch! You shot me!
3586515 3587983 You crazy bastard!
3592395 3594523 Don't shoot me again.<br />Don't kill me.
3598318 3599820 He'll live.
3614666 3616668 Son of a bitch!
3617794 3619467 Let's try to remain calm.
3619671 3621663 Open it, or he'll be dead<br />before he hits the floor.
3621673 3623596 There's no way, Connor. Let him go.
3623800 3625928 Open the door.<br />It ain't gonna happen.
3626135 3627978 Take it easy, Sarah. Easy.
3628179 3629806 It won't work, Sarah.<br />You're no killer.
3630014 3631357 I don't believe you can do it.
3631557 3632809 You're already dead, Silberman.
3633017 3634498 Everybody dies.<br />You know I believe it.
3634644 3638274 - So don't fuck with me!<br />- Open the door. Open the door.
3644569 3646788 Back off!
3646988 3648285 Get back!
3648490 3650288 I'll pump him full of this shit.<br />I swear!
3652160 3653707 Don't move!
3655038 3658008 - Drop the shit!<br />- Do it! Do it!
3658583 3660881 Get in the office.<br />On the floor, face down.
3661086 3662177 Not you!
3662378 3663880 Open the door.
3666882 3669135 On the floor. Hold it open.<br />Face the wall!
3686359 3687861 Get her! Get her!
3714094 3715641 Sarah!
3715846 3718689 - Hurry up! Open the door!<br />- The door's locked!
3719682 3721650 Let's go! Open it!
3721851 3722647 Get the other door!
3724270 3726113 - She broke it off.<br />- Open it!
3731652 3733825 Let's go around! Come on!<br />Move it!
3759219 3760516 No!
3760721 3762064 No!
3764141 3767111 - No!<br />- Mom, wait!
3767311 3768608 Mom!
3774233 3777783 - Come back here!<br />- No! No!
3778404 3779496 No!
3779697 3781199 - Help her!<br />- Wait here.
3781407 3782909 Hurry UP!
3783117 3785085 He'll kill us all! He'll kill us all!
3785286 3786378 Hold her.
3788080 3789627 He'll kill us all!
3811268 3813521 Mom, are you OK? Mom!
3818234 3820532 Come with me, if you want to live.
3820736 3822955 It's OK, Mom. He's here to help.<br />It's OK.
3847761 3848887 Go.
3881376 3883754 What the fuck is it?<br />What the fuck is going on?
3898684 3900027 Get down.
3916618 3918336 No! Mom!
3936470 3937847 Out of the car!
3939389 3940436 Right now!
3965248 3966921 Go!
3977342 3978389 I'm out.
3985350 3987101 - Come on.<br />- Here.
3989812 3991735 Reload.
4000823 4002666 Last one!
4009789 4011416 Hang on.
4037774 4039026 Ready!
4044613 4045956 John!
4053039 4054666 Here, drive.
4108341 4110343 He's not back there.<br />There's nobody behind us.
4110551 4112723 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah.
4114971 4118271 - Can you even see anything?<br />- I see everything.
4121436 4122904 Cool.
4126650 4128197 Come here.
4134323 4135950 I said I was OK.
4136909 4139879 John,<br />it was stupid of you to go there.
4140996 4143124 God dammit! You have to be<br />smarter than that.
4143332 4144800 You almost got yourself killed.
4146168 4147760 What were you thinking?
4148795 4151298 You cannot risk yourself,<br />even for me.
4151506 4152849 Do you understand?
4153049 4157225 You're too important.<br />Do you understand?
4160223 4161224 But...
4163059 4166653 I had to get you out of that place.<br />I'm sorry.
4168021 4170240 I didn't need your help.<br />I can take care of myself.
4177573 4179075 What's wrong with your eyes?
4181243 4182586 Nothing.
4192587 4194885 So, what's your story?
4205474 4206521 You OK?
4206725 4208147 Fine.
4210061 4213156 Say, that's a nice bike.
4235169 4237297 Hey! Watch it, lug nuts.
4245136 4248106 Listen,<br />do you know what you're doing?
4248306 4251150 I have detailed files<br />on human anatomy.
4252101 4257072 I bet! Makes you<br />a more efficient killer, right?
4257272 4258319 Correct.
4265030 4266327 Does it hurt when you get shot?
4268367 4271211 I sense injuries. The data<br />could be called pain.
4273746 4275498 John, help me with the light.
4275748 4277716 - Will these heal up?<br />- Yes.
4278084 4281384 Good. If you can't pass for human,<br />you're not much good to us.
4282338 4285091 How long do you live,<br />I mean "last", whatever?
4285758 4288011 120 years with<br />my existing power cell.
4288511 4290980 Can you learn stuff you<br />haven't been programmed with?
4291347 4296147 So you can be...<br />you know, more human?
4297102 4298570 Not such a dork all the time?
4302899 4305903 My CPU is a neural-net processor,<br />a learning computer,
4306152 4309156 that Skynet presets the switch to<br />READ only when we're sent out alone.
4312074 4313951 Doesn't want you<br />to do too much thinking.
4314493 4315540 No.
4317329 4319047 Can we reset the switch?
4337515 4341110 Rotate the two locking cylinders<br />counterclockwise.
4347608 4348450 Do it.
4357409 4358911 Now open the port cover.
4362331 4364378 Pull to break the seal.
4368377 4371881 Good, now remove<br />the shock damping assembly.
4375593 4377721 You can now access the CPU.
4379138 4380606 - Do you see it?<br />- Yes.
4381473 4383350 Pull the CPU by its base tap.
4385310 4386106 Pull.
4424263 4425355 Can you see the pin switch?
4425932 4427184 No!
4428935 4430858 - Out of my way, John!<br />- Don't kill him!
4432230 4434653 "It", John, not "him".
4434899 4437822 Okay, "it". But we need "it".
4438652 4440245 Listen to me. Listen.
4441279 4442781 We're better off on our own.
4443365 4446539 He's the only proof of<br />the future, the war and that.
4447994 4449086 Maybe.
4451915 4453292 I don't trust it.
4454208 4455460 But he's my friend, alright?
4456585 4459185 You don't know what it's like<br />to try kill one of these things.
4459450 4462250 And if something goes wrong,<br />this could be our last chance, so mo...
4462360 4465160 Look mom, if I'm ever supposed to<br />be this great military leader,
4465261 4468461 maybe you start listening to my<br />leadership ideas once in a while.
4472000 4475700 'Cause if my own mother won't,<br />how do you expect anyone else to?
4490951 4493795 Alright, play it your way.
4501295 4503297 Was there a problem?
4503505 4504882 No problem.
4506592 4507808 None whatsoever.
4541458 4542960 Are we learning yet?
4555971 4558941 We have to get as far away<br />from the city as possible.
4562852 4564695 Just head south.
4573238 4574706 Keep it under 65.
4574906 4577534 - We don't wanna be pulled over.<br />- Affirmative.
4578368 4583248 No, no, no. You gotta listen<br />to the way people talk.
4583455 4586880 You don't say "affirmative"<br />or some shit like that.
4587084 4589257 <i>You say, "No problemo."</i>
4589461 4593261 And if someone comes up to you<br />with an attitude, you say, "Eat me!"
4593465 4597594 And if you want to shine them on,<br />it's <i>"Hasta</i> la vista, baby."
4598469 4600221 <i>Hasta</i> la vista, baby.
4601264 4602982 Yeah, or "Later, dick-wad."
4603182 4605981 And if someone gets upset,<br />you say, "Chill out."
4606185 4610611 - Or you can do combinations.<br />- Chill out, dick-wad.
4611524 4613447 That's great. See? You're getting it.
4613651 4615573 <i>No problemo.</i>
4625912 4629132 - You got any cash?<br />- I got a couple of hundred bucks.
4629457 4630674 I'll give you half.
4631668 4632794 Mom!
4634253 4635550 Get some food.
4638215 4640013 No sense of humor.
4646015 4647685 And that's another thing:
4648017 4649717 You can lighten up a bit yourself.
4650519 4654614 This severe routine is getting old.<br />You're acting like such a geek.
4654856 4656324 Smile once in a while.
4656566 4657909 Smile?
4658234 4660612 Yeah. You know, smile.
4660945 4661992 Watch.
4663489 4666789 Hi. Nice place you got here.<br />How's business?
4667702 4669169 Gimme a break.
4670579 4673173 Okay. Bad example.
4674041 4677011 See that guy over there?<br />That's a smile.
4697271 4698318 That's good.
4698564 4701693 Maybe you could practice<br />in front of a mirror or something.
4708600 4709850 Want some of my fries?
4720500 4721600 Do you need any help?
4722500 4723400 No.
4723600 4725200 - I got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4725400 4727000 - I got you!<br />- No, you didn't!
4734932 4736605 We're not gonna make it, are we?
4739269 4740521 People, I mean.
4743523 4745525 It's in your nature<br />to destroy yourselves.
4746693 4749321 Yeah. Major drag, huh?
4749529 4752408 Break it up<br />before I wring both of your necks.
4754534 4758880 I need to know how Skynet gets built,<br />who's responsible.
4759079 4762549 The man most directly responsible<br />is Miles Bennett Dyson.
4763458 4764584 Who is that?
4764793 4767922 He's the director of special projects<br />at Cyberdyne Systems Corporation.
4771216 4772843 Why him?
4773051 4775304 In a few months he creates<br />a revolutionary type
4775512 4776764 of microprocessor.
4777513 4780767 - Go on. Then what?<br />- In three years,
4780975 4782943 Cyberdyne will become the largest<br />supplier
4783144 4784396 of military computer systems.
4785396 4788195 All Stealth bombers are upgraded<br />with Cyberdyne computers,
4788399 4789742 becoming fully unmanned.
4789942 4793071 Afterwards, they fly<br />with a perfect operational record.
4793279 4795656 The Skynet Funding bill is passed.
4795864 4799164 The system goes online<br />on August 4th, 1997.
4799367 4802291 Human decisions are removed<br />from strategic defense.
4802495 4805214 Skynet begins to learn<br />at a geometric rate.
4805415 4809591 It becomes self-aware at 02:14 am<br />Eastern time, August 29.
4810754 4813097 In a panic,<br />they try to pull the plug.
4814423 4816642 - Skynet fights back.<br />- Yes.
4816842 4819345 It launches its missiles<br />against the targets in Russia.
4819553 4822602 Why attack Russia?<br />Aren't they our friends now?
4822806 4825059 Because Skynet knows<br />that the Russian counterattack
4825267 4827065 will eliminate its enemies over here.
4827269 4828771 Jesus!
4832190 4833511 How much do you know about Dyson?
4836152 4837825 I have detailed files.
4839405 4840873 Want to know everything.
4842492 4845871 What he looks like.<br />Where he lives. Everything.
4857756 4859008 Miles!
4881195 4884449 - You going to work all day?<br />- I'm sorry, baby.
4884907 4886658 This thing<br />is kicking my ass.
4887117 4890872 It's Sunday. You promised to take<br />the kids to Raging Waters today.
4892789 4896009 I can't. I'm on a roll.
4909847 4913101 This is gonna blow 'em away.<br />It's a neural-net processor.
4913350 4914818 I know. You told me.
4915060 4917813 It thinks and learns like we do.
4918272 4920695 It's superconducting<br />at room temperature.
4920940 4924911 Other computers are just<br />pocket calculators by comparison.
4927196 4928869 Why is that so important?
4929115 4931584 I need to know,<br />'cause sometimes I feel like
4932034 4934162 I'm going crazy here.
4935705 4937628 Baby, I am this close.
4938666 4939712 Come here.
4942043 4945889 Imagine a jet airliner<br />with a pilot that never gets tired,
4946131 4949305 never makes mistakes,<br />never shows up with a hangover.
4951803 4953646 Meet the pilot.
4954222 4958397 Why did we get married?<br />Have children? You don't need us.
4959143 4962317 Your heart and your mind<br />are in here.
4962646 4964819 But it doesn't love you like we do.
4973240 4975662 I'm sorry. Really.
4976409 4980004 How about spending some time<br />with your other babies?
4983041 4984759 - Raging Waters?<br />- Yeah!
5014987 5016614 Wait in the car.
5035173 5037050 Enrique!
5037259 5039603 Are you here?
5055025 5056368 You're pretty jumpy, Connor.
5058779 5064582 And you... are always like a snake.
5066703 5068705 It's great<br />to see you, Connor!
5068913 5069994 I told you I would be back.
5070164 5072883 I knew you would.<br />It's good to see you.
5073084 5073926 Jolanda!
5074127 5077347 Get out here, we got company.<br />And bring some tequila.
5077547 5080676 - Hey, big John. Como te va?<br />- What's up?
5080883 5082601 Who's this big guy?
5082802 5087773 He's cool, Enrique.<br />He's with me. He's, er... Uncle Bob.
5087973 5089816 Uncle Bob, this is Enrique.
5090017 5092440 Uncle Bob, huh?
5093020 5095523 OK. OK!
5096898 5097990 How are you?
5098191 5101490 How are you?<br />You've grown so much.
5101694 5103196 Drink?
5107491 5108743 Uncle Bob?
5109827 5113832 Hey, Sarita! You're pretty<br />famous, all over the goddamn TV.
5114040 5116589 Pictures of you, John,<br />your big friend here.
5116792 5119510 Cops are going nuts<br />looking for you.
5122422 5123548 I just came for my stuff.
5123757 5126226 I need clothes,<br />food and one of your trucks.
5126426 5128394 How about the fillings<br />out of my fucking teeth?
5128595 5131098 Now, Enrique!
5132140 5135940 - You two, you're on weapons detail.<br />- Come on. Let's go.
5156829 5159252 One thing about my mom...
5161084 5163212 ...she always plans ahead.
5173762 5174729 Excellent.
5185941 5189491 This is the best truck I got,<br />but the starter is gone.
5189694 5192537 - You got the time to change it out?<br />- Yeah.
5192738 5194661 I'm gonna wait till dark<br />to cross the border.
5194782 5197786 Enrique, it's dangerous for you here.
5198077 5200705 - You get out tonight too, okay?<br />- Sure.
5202206 5205585 Just drop by any time<br />and totally fuck up my life.
5211172 5213925 See, I grew up in places like this,
5214259 5216933 so I thought<br />that's how people lived:
5217595 5220849 riding around in helicopters,
5221391 5223485 learning how to blow shit up.
5225311 5230066 But then, when my mom got busted,<br />I got put in a regular school.
5231442 5233911 The other kids were into Nintendo.
5248416 5250214 Are you ever afraid?
5250460 5251757 No.
5256007 5257224 Not even of dying?
5258301 5259393 No.
5264389 5268314 You don't feel any emotion about it<br />one way or another?
5268560 5271188 No.<br />I have to stay functional
5271438 5273486 until the mission is complete.
5278069 5280037 Then it doesn't matter.
5280530 5284079 Yeah. I have to stay functional too.<br />I'm "too important".
5300840 5302308 That's definitely you.
5314562 5316689 Most of the guys my mom<br />hung round with were geeks.
5316897 5320572 But there was this one guy,<br />he was kinda cool.
5320776 5323950 - He taught me engines.<br />- Hold here.
5324905 5327328 Mom screwed it up, of course.
5327533 5329581 She'd always tell 'em about<br />Judgment Day
5329785 5332163 and me being this world leader.
5332955 5336959 - That'd be all she wrote.<br />- Torque wrench, please.
5339377 5340469 Here.
5341504 5345930 - I wish I could've met my real dad.<br />- You will.
5346133 5350730 Yeah, I guess.<br />When I'm, like, 45, I think.
5352014 5355187 I sent him back through time<br />to 1984.
5356017 5357269 Man!
5358979 5361277 He hasn't even been born yet.
5363024 5364992 It messes with your head.
5367612 5370240 - The other bolt.<br />- Oh. Here.
5377204 5380629 Mom and him were only together<br />for one night.
5380833 5386010 She still loves him, I guess.<br />I see her crying sometimes.
5386213 5387635 She denies it totally, of course,
5387840 5390638 like she got something<br />stuck in her eye.
5394887 5396389 Why do you cry?
5397515 5399313 - You mean people?<br />- Yeah.
5399517 5401986 I don't know. We just cry.
5402937 5405281 You know, when it hurts.
5411570 5416576 - Pain causes it?<br />- Er... no. It's different.
5416783 5419753 It's when there's nothing wrong<br />with you, but you hurt anyways.
5419953 5421375 - Get it?<br />- No.
5422748 5424341 All right, my man!
5424540 5427760 - No problemo.<br />- Give me five.
5430296 5432219 Just put out your hand, like this.
5433591 5437312 All right! Now hit me.<br />Give me five. Do the same thing.
5437511 5439559 All right!
5442475 5444818 OK, that's good. Up high! High five!
5445935 5447061 Five low.
5447270 5448772 Too slow.
5451941 5454069 I'm just kidding. One more time.
5454277 5456371 Good. Now try it. Good!
5456571 5458323 Now do me. Give me five.
5460033 5462034 <i>Watching John<br />with the machine,</i>
5462242 5464415 <i>it was suddenly so clear.</i>
5464620 5467590 <i>The Terminator would never stop.</i>
5467790 5471465 <i>It would never leave him<br />and it would never hurt him,</i>
5471669 5475094 <i>never shout at him<br />or get drunk and hit him</i>
5475297 5477595 <i>or say it was too busy<br />to spend time with him.</i>
5478633 5483355 <i>It would always be there<br />and it would die to protect him.</i>
5485098 5488102 <i>Of all the would-be fathers<br />who came and went over the years,</i>
5488309 5492655 <i>this thing, this machine,<br />was the only one who measured up.</i>
5493648 5498073 <i>In an insane world,<br />it was the sanest choice.</i>
5531100 5533100 Come here, darling.
5595702 5597921 Hey, let's try this one.
5603293 5604839 There we go.
5711061 5713483 She said you go south<br />with him like you planned.
5713688 5716692 - She'll meet you tomorrow.<br />- Mom!
5716900 5718652 Mom, wait!
5734124 5735842 "No fate."
5737169 5739388 "No fate, but what we make."
5741548 5743175 My father told her this.
5746178 5750774 I mean, I made him memorize it<br />in the future as a message to her.
5752016 5757193 Never mind.<br />Now, OK, the whole thing goes...
5757396 5760024 The future's not set.
5760232 5763657 There's no fate,<br />but what we make for ourselves.
5763861 5768366 - She intends to change the future.<br />- Yeah, I guess.
5769824 5771542 Oh, shit!
5771743 5773541 - Dyson.<br />- Yeah.
5773745 5777124 Gotta be. Miles Dyson.
5777332 5779209 She's gonna blow him away.
5779417 5781294 Come on! Let's go!
5781503 5783176 Let's go! Come on!
5793931 5796935 - This is tactically dangerous.<br />- Drive faster.
5797142 5800897 The T-1000 has the same files<br />that I do. It knows what I know.
5801105 5805610 - It might anticipate this move.<br />- I don't care. We gotta stop her.
5805817 5808195 Killing Dyson might prevent the war.
5808403 5810121 I don't care!
5810321 5812119 Haven't you learned anything yet?
5812323 5814496 Haven't you figured out<br />why you can't kill people?
5817370 5820214 Look, maybe you don't care<br />if you live or die.
5820455 5823504 But everybody's not like that!<br />We have feelings.
5823709 5825632 We hurt. We're afraid.
5828213 5832468 You gotta learn this stuff.<br />I'm not kidding. It's important.
5868960 5872760 Danny, I told you<br />to go to bed. I'm not kidding.
5872964 5874965 Just a couple of minutes,<br />Mom!
5892315 5894488 Danny, your time is up.
5894650 5897369 Come brush your teeth<br />and get to bed.
5926014 5927231 Danny!
5928682 5930309 Ugh!
5938984 5942739 - Daddy!<br />- Danny, just go! Go, Danny! Go!
5944448 5945495 Miles?
5949244 5950666 Miles!
5950870 5953168 - Tarissa, run!<br />- Oh, my God!
5960380 5962303 Tarissa, just take Danny and go. Run!
5962507 5963633 Run!
5963842 5965468 Oh, Jesus! Miles!
5984819 5987019 - Daddy!<br />- Danny! Danny!
5987113 5990617 - Nobody fucking move!<br />- Don't hurt my daddy!
5990825 5994500 Get down on the floor, bitch.<br />Get down now!
5994704 5996456 Get out of the way.
5996664 5998257 Don't hurt him!
5999959 6001505 Get on the floor now!
6003795 6006264 Just let the boy go.
6006464 6009308 Shut up. Shut up. Shut up! Shut up!
6009509 6011978 It's all your fault, motherfucker.
6012179 6014307 - It's all your fault!<br />- What?
6014514 6016516 I'm not gonna let you do it.
6035159 6036284 Shhh!
6040538 6041755 Shhh.
6068607 6070985 Shit! We're too late!
6075196 6076197 Check them.
6079909 6083413 Look at me, Mom. Are you hurt?
6084372 6085919 Look at me.
6087917 6089885 I almost...
6090085 6092008 I almost...
6101805 6105855 It'll be OK. It's gonna be OK.<br />We'll figure something out. OK?
6107811 6109153 I promise.
6113023 6118200 - You came here to stop me.<br />- Yeah, I did.
6121282 6123080 I love you, John.
6124994 6127087 I always have.
6128538 6130381 I know.
6136838 6138886 Deep penetration.
6140633 6142431 No shattered bone.
6142635 6145433 You hold here. The pressure<br />should stop the bleeding.
6156356 6159530 - Who are you people?<br />- Show him.
6162820 6166870 Danny, I want you to come with me<br />right now. Show me your room.
6179920 6183048 Oh, God! No!
6195518 6197816 Oh, my God!
6207071 6208573 Oh, my God.
6208781 6211250 Now, listen to me very carefully.
6213660 6216960 Nuclear winter effects<br />caused massive cooling...
6217400 6221000 <i>Dyson listened while<br />the Terminator laid it all down.</i>
6221600 6224900 <i>Skynet. Judgment Day.</i>
6225300 6227800 <i>The history of things to come.</i>
6229300 6231100 <i>It's not every day that you find out</i>
6231219 6234119 <i>you're responsible<br />for three billion deaths.</i>
6234900 6237300 <i>He took it pretty well.</i>
6238809 6241403 I feel like I'm gonna throw up.
6247901 6252497 You're judging me<br />on things I haven't even done yet.
6256242 6258870 How were we supposed to know?
6260955 6262582 Yeah!
6262790 6264292 Right.
6265209 6268304 How were you supposed to know?
6268504 6272098 Fucking men like you<br />built the hydrogen bomb.
6272298 6276519 Men like you thought it up.
6280306 6283355 You think you're so creative.
6283560 6286609 You don't know what it's like<br />to really create something,
6286813 6290407 to create a life,<br />to feel it growing inside you.
6290607 6292860 All you know how to create<br />is death and destruction.
6293068 6294445 Mom!
6295404 6299034 We need to be a little more<br />constructive here. OK?
6299241 6301282 We still have to stop this<br />from happening, don't we?
6301410 6303128 But I thought...
6304329 6308174 Aren't we changing things right now,<br />changing the way it goes?
6308374 6311924 That's right. There's no way<br />I'm gonna finish the new processor.
6312128 6314802 Not now. Forget it. I'm out of it.
6315006 6318601 - I'll quit Cyberdyne tomorrow.<br />- That's not good enough.
6318801 6321805 - No one must follow your work.<br />- Right.
6322889 6326734 All right, then we have to destroy<br />all the stuff at the lab:
6326933 6331359 the files, the disk drives,<br />everything, everything here.
6332189 6335033 Everything. I don't care.
6337027 6337823 The chip.
6338445 6340086 - Do you know about the chip?<br />- What chip?
6340197 6341699 They keep it in a vault<br />at Cyberdyne.
6341906 6343355 It must be from<br />the other one like you.
6343365 6347745 - The CPU from the first Terminator.<br />- Son of a bitch! I knew it!
6347953 6350547 They told us<br />not to ask where they got it.
6350748 6352967 Those lying motherfuckers.
6353167 6354840 It's scary stuff. Radically advanced.
6355044 6357172 I mean,<br />it was smashed, it didn't work,
6357379 6358756 but it gave us ideas,
6358964 6361842 took us in new directions,<br />things we would've never th...
6364093 6366095 All my work was based on it.
6366304 6367977 It must be destroyed.
6370308 6373278 Can you get us in? Past security?
6373478 6376402 I think so, yeah. When?
6380442 6381409 Now?
6385656 6388330 'The future,<br />always so clear to me,
6388534 6391458 'had become<br />like a black highway at night.
6391662 6397213 'We were in uncharted territory now,<br />making up history as we went along.'
6432658 6437164 Hi. Er... Carl, right?
6438914 6440757 Friends from out of town.<br />I just thought I'd...
6441166 6442008 Hi!
6442418 6444295 ...take 'em upstairs<br />and show 'em around.
6444503 6447677 Mr Dyson, you know the rules<br />concerning visitors in the lab.
6447881 6449882 I need written authorization...
6451092 6454813 - I insist.<br />- Don't even think about it.
6465773 6467320 Come on. It's OK.
6468734 6470175 It takes two keys to open the vault.
6470319 6471912 They have<br />to be turned simultaneously.
6472112 6474786 The other one is in a locker<br />at the security station.
6476408 6477660 Gibbons?
6480912 6485588 Gibbons! Come on, man!<br />You can't leave the desk like that!
6487877 6489129 Gibbons!
6490630 6491927 Oh, shit.
6509898 6511946 My card should access this.
6515654 6517782 - What? What is it?<br />- Damn it.
6519032 6520830 The silent alarm's been tripped.
6526955 6529754 It's neutralized all the codes<br />in the entire building.
6529958 6533553 Nothing will open anywhere now.<br />We have to abort.
6534797 6536219 No.
6537925 6541098 We go all the way. OK?
6543388 6547063 You guys get started on the lab.<br />I can open this.
6547266 6548707 I think it's that guy from the mall.
6548893 6549815 It is!
6550019 6552192 It's him and the woman.
6553523 6556367 Look, just send everything<br />you got in the area right now.
6558944 6562198 I have a personal entry code<br />for the lab. It may still work.
6566868 6569041 - It's no good.<br />- Let me try mine.
6574292 6576259 John, fire in the hole!
6588431 6593107 Wait! You can't go in there.<br />The fire set off the halon system.
6600400 6602744 You have to wait a few<br />minutes until the gas clears.
6605363 6606489 Put this on.
6620753 6623006 All right, let's get to work.
6644942 6647865 All units in the vicinity,<br />all units able to respond:
6648069 6652575 A 211 in progress at 2144 Kramer<br />Street, the Cyberdyne building.
6652908 6654831 Suspect 1 is white, female,
6655035 6658039 identified as: last name Connor,<br />first name Sarah,
6658246 6660874 escaped last night from<br />Pescadero State Hospital.
6661374 6662671 Suspect 2: white, male...
6666962 6671012 All the disks in my office. All the<br />disks in that office over there.
6671258 6673226 Everything behind my desk.
6673369 6675369 All the processors on my left.
6675621 6677874 We'll blow it up with the CP4.
6691778 6693155 Could I...
6693655 6695202 Excuse me...
6697408 6699536 Could I borrow that thing?
6708877 6711300 I worked a lot<br />of years on this thing.
6715342 6719596 - Give me that location again.<br />- 2111, Kramer.
6719846 6723476 The suspects are armed and<br />considered extremely dangerous.
6774689 6776362 All right!
6776566 6778193 7-2-5-6.
6779777 6780699 Yes!
6785491 6786788 Easy money.
6791580 6792923 Uh-oh.
6795626 6797924 Oh, shit! Not good.
6798128 6799300 Not good!
6803133 6806387 - How we doing?<br />- Primer cord is set.
6806595 6808848 One more barrel, two more minutes.
6810890 6815737 - How do we set them off?<br />- Remote control.
6815937 6818190 Piece of cake.
6818397 6819819 - We got company.<br />- Police?
6820024 6823244 - How many?<br />- All of 'em, I think.
6823444 6825367 Go. I'll finish here.
6826822 6828118 Come on.
6829324 6832498 - I'll take care of the police.<br />- Wait! You swore!
6835622 6836874 Trust me.
6850302 6852179 <i>You at the window!</i>
6852388 6855358 <i>Drop your weapon and place<br />your hands on top of your head!</i>
6856809 6860109 - Holy shit!<br />- That's a damn mini-gun!
6882582 6884755 - Come on!<br />- Oh, shit!
6884960 6886337 Go! Go! Go!
6934049 6935425 Fire!
6952733 6954484 We go same time, to the left.
6954692 6957286 One, two, three, go.
6969207 6971755 All right, in order to get that out,<br />you have to...
6979466 6983096 We got Skynet by the balls now,<br />don't we? Come on, let's book.
6984471 6985814 Hold your fire!
7011454 7013707 - Ready to rock?<br />- Ready.
7017210 7019838 Time to go. Now.
7020046 7022845 - Take this. They'll use gas.<br />- Come on.
7023049 7026018 Get started on the door.<br />Miles, hand me the detonator.
7050616 7053039 Mom! Mom!
7090988 7092615 Aagh!
7097702 7098498 Shit!

7113134 7114010 Get down!
7121266 7122518 Here.
7148251 7151050 I don't know how much longer<br />I can hold this.
7155882 7158601 Fall back! Everybody out!
7158802 7160554 Fall back now! Go! Go! Go!
7196713 7197930 <i>We got a war zone<br />down here!</i>
7230369 7231871 Shut your eyes.

7249554 7251477 Get down on the floor, face down!
7254726 7255773 Down on the floor now!
7258271 7259613 OK, drop him!

7353694 7355492 I think it's him!

7453830 7455252 - You got it?<br />- Yeah.
7455457 7456958 All right.
7471180 7473478 - Chopper's coming in!<br />- It's him.
7531403 7532620 Yeah!
7534990 7536663 John! Stay down!
7562308 7563776 - Aagh!<br />- Mom!

7621530 7623498 Come on, Mom, we gotta get out.
7625992 7627744 - Take the shotgun.<br />- OK.
7629871 7630667 Agh!
7631790 7633007 Are you hurt?
7645845 7649645 - Holy shit! Come on, Mom. Come on!<br />- We need your truck.

7669075 7670952 What the hell...?
7677416 7679589 - I'm bleeding bad.<br />- Keep pressure on it.
7681587 7682884 Here. This'll work.
7689178 7690929 He's gaining.
7692889 7695688 - Step on it!<br />- This is the vehicle's top speed.
7695892 7697940 I can run faster than this!
7708279 7709575 Coming up, to the right.
7712240 7713583 Watch it! Watch it!
7736514 7738435 - Drive a minute.<br />- Where the hell are you going?
7746147 7747694 Take the off-ramp.
7757742 7758538 Shit!
7762580 7763455 Hold on!

8006477 8008445 Come on! Get up!
8022325 8023747 Hand me the shotgun.

8111868 8112994 Go back.
8121335 8123462 - Go. Run.<br />- No! We gotta stick together.
8124087 8125555 John, you've got to go now.

8324610 8325827 I know this hurts.
8326820 8329289 - Ugh!<br />- Call John.
8346714 8348637 Call to John now.
8350760 8352057 Fuck you!

8736415 8738634 Get up. Come on.
8740836 8742383 Holy shit!
8742588 8744261 I need a vacation.
8758770 8762445 - Is it dead?<br />- Terminated.
8765985 8767578 Will this melt in there?
8770822 8772415 Yes. Throw it in.
8777287 8778129 <i>Adios!</i>
8780165 8782338 And the chip.
8796806 8798228 It's over.
8800768 8801815 No.
8805356 8806732 There's one more chip.
8811736 8813704 And it must be destroyed also.
8819369 8820746 Here.
8820954 8824958 I cannot self-terminate.<br />You must lower me into the steel.
8830587 8832134 No.
8833423 8834219 No.
8837594 8839972 - I'm sorry, John. I'm sorry.<br />- No!
8840180 8842181 No, it'll be OK. Stay with us.
8842390 8844267 - It'll be OK.<br />- I have to go away.
8844475 8846944 No, don't do it. Please, don't go.
8847144 8849897 - I must go away, John.<br />- No!
8850565 8851657 No, wait.
8851858 8854611 - You don't have to do this.<br />- I'm sorry.
8855778 8857826 No, don't do it! Don't go!
8858281 8859827 It has to end here.
8861157 8864331 I order you not to go!<br />I order you not to go!
8864536 8866038 I order you not to go!
8872586 8874338 I know now why you cry.
8876840 8879012 But it's something I can never do.
