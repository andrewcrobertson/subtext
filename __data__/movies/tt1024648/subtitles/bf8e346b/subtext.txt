93623 95470 This is the Persian Empire
95151 96946 known today as Iran.
98134 101994 For 2,500 years, this land<br />was ruled by a series of kings
102399 104269 known as "Shahs".
105176 109500 In 1950, the people of Iran<br />elected Mohammad Mosaddegh
109750 112680 a secular democrat, as prime minister.
113150 116480 He nationalized British and US<br />petroleum holdings,
116750 119414 returning Iran's oil to its people.
120950 122680 But in 1953,
122810 125569 the US and Great Britain<br />engineered a coup d'etat
125640 130614 that deposed Mosaddegh,<br />and installed Reza Pahlavi as Shah.
131902 135232 The young child was known<br />for opulence and excess.
135589 138317 His wife was rumored to bathe in milk,
138641 142641 while the Shah had his lunches<br />flown in by concord from Paris.
143863 145448 The people starved.
147810 151323 The Shah kept power through<br />his ruthless internal police,
151480 152810 the Savak.
153272 156331 An era of torture and fear began.
158603 162077 He then began a campaign<br />to westernize Iran,
163190 167098 enraging the the mostly<br />traditional Shia population.
167625 171925 In 1979,<br />the people of Iran overthrew the Shah.
173954 178494 The exiled cleric, Ayatollah Khomeini,<br />returned to rule Iran.
180880 186708 It descended into score settling,<br />death squads and chaos.
189280 193150 Dying of cancer, the Shah<br />was given asylum in the US.
194994 198814 The Iranian people took<br />to the streets outside the US embassy,
198884 202485 demanding that the Shah<br />be returned, tried…
203894 204797 and hanged.

274293 276807 The carnival is a<br />little bigger today, huh?
278898 281261 The windows are supposed<br />to be bulletproof, right?
282150 283600 They have never been tested.
283944 286094 Okay, you just need to finish filling out
286270 287620 this section here.
340420 342000 We need some security.
342100 344066 Yes, it is your responsibility-
344074 345830 They drew over the walls.
345920 347020 We should all split.
347200 348491 I'm gonna close up my office.
368313 369231 My God!
370330 371530 Marins to Number 1.
371800 372490 Full back.
372512 373341 – Look, I need police,<br />– Can anyone hear me?
373342 374260 – I need police right now.<br />– We're on the second floor.
374270 375041 – You understand me?<br />– We need help.
375050 376180 Right now, goddamn it!
376492 378188 Can anybody hear me?
378189 379020 There is a breach.
381208 382651 Burn everything! Burn it, now!
382659 385620 Alright burn everything,<br />all the files, file cabinets, safe.
400410 401508 Lets get a cart over here.
401509 402610 Burn it all, come on!
402640 404998 Burn everything, including<br />the classified. Everything!
410470 412320 Don't fucking shoot anybody.
412555 415063 You don't want to be<br />the son of a bitch who started the war.
415302 417015 They need an hour to burn the classified.
418066 418968 I need you to hold.
419270 420480 If you shoot one person,
420970 423079 they're gonna kill every<br />single one of us in here.
432170 434947 I'm telling you if we're going to go,<br />we need to go now!
434954 437099 – And we need to make a decision, and-<br />– Joe can we- Joe can we wait,
437109 438860 can we wait until<br />the Iranian police come?
438866 440280 – No!<br />– They're not coming.
441080 442140 How do you know they're not coming?
442150 443163 They may well be coming.
443179 444469 The police have abandoned their post-
444477 446998 If the police are not coming, okay,<br />then the army's gonna come.
447006 447840 The Prime Minister is not gonna let<br />the embassy be taken over.
447850 450458 I understand. The Prime Minister<br />may come tomorrow,
450459 451938 but the Komiteh are here today.
451939 454099 Alright, is there- is there any value<br />that we're waiting 15-
454110 454869 Look at me!
455080 456170 No one is coming.
456196 457595 Burn it!<br />We have forty minutes.
460570 463070 Get it down to the incinerator,<br />in the vault. Now!
463127 464937 Tear gas is a last resort only.
464971 467630 <i>I repeat: only if you're under threat.
505062 509536 In here, we are in America right now,<br />outside of these doors, we are in Iran!
509537 510465 I'm not going out there!
510466 512233 – They're not safe here.<br />-Alright, first let's get these-
512250 514408 If they get caught<br />applying for visas to the US…
514416 515898 You know what, lets-<br />lets wait five minutes.
515913 518280 We're in the only building<br />with direct access to the street,
518281 520280 if we're going to go,<br />then we need to go now!
520520 522024 – Yeah, I'm in.<br />– Yeah.
522057 522858 Yeah, lets go.
528045 528950 I'm going outside.
529233 529880 Why?
530030 531250 To reason them.
557948 558877 Open the door!
560012 561160 Open the door!
561580 563160 Open this goddamn door!
565036 567300 You said you wanna see the world, Elton?
567676 570168 Let me in! Let me in!
578196 580014 – Burn it all, come on!<br />– Right come on, guys!
580028 582490 The safe and the filing cabinets get long.
590210 592510 All four drawers,<br />I want them shredded, right now!
592511 593906 But the shred not fast enough.
594817 596929 Guys, get the visa plates.
597889 600391 All four, and anything<br />else you see out there.
600908 602748 If in doubt, you shred it.
605128 607927 We've got ten minutes,<br />lets go, go, go, everything!
617672 618416 Get the shredder.
618438 620043 There are no police.
684870 685677 – Okay.<br />– Come on.
685685 687828 – Where do we go?<br />– We gotta get off the streets.
688316 689812 This way, up here to the left.
720288 721970 These fucks hit us,<br />we can't hit 'em back?
721971 723970 Mossaddegh, we did it to them first.
723999 726060 The Soviets would put up with this shit,<br />they would fucking invade them.
726083 726705 Shaffer!
726707 729446 Sir, what d'you expect? We helped the guy<br />torture and deball an entire population.
729461 730210 How many were there?
730290 731880 At least fifty. We're not sure.
732476 733200 Shaffer!
733216 734457 You still haven't found Shaffer?
734476 736672 No I was screaming his name<br />'cos I was fucking 'em.
740190 741810 It's confirmed, sir, six escaped.
741850 742990 I was told five.
743050 744360 Now sir, apparently it's six.
744580 745320 So what happened?
745321 747390 Not clear. We know they<br />escaped the embassy.
747530 748232 Where are they?
748290 749809 The Canadian Ambassador's house.
749810 751573 Do they stay put?<br />Are we attempting a rescue?
751600 753087 I put through the Secretary of State.
753368 754168 Yes.
754458 755622 Is White House joining?
755638 757712 They're claiming the Embassy<br />was a den of espionage.
757717 759399 We wish it was a fucking den of espionage.
759417 762185 CIA's got three people over there,<br />they don't see a revolution coming?
762196 763883 Call it something other then intelligence.
763924 765596 Hold for the Chief of Staff.<br />Harding?
765670 766461 I'll call him back.
766715 769280 They're sticking to it, no release<br />till we expel the Shah.
769294 770728 Well, put him on a plane then, fuck him!
770743 772125 He's half dead and he's in chemo.
772339 774022 Well, we took him in, he's ours now.
774102 776472 Great, so we'll take any prick<br />as long as he's got cancer?
776620 778000 Just the pricks on our side.
778460 780288 So all of our other pricks<br />on their prick thrones
780289 781727 will know that when they<br />get thrown out on a rail,
781735 783324 they won't get their<br />fucking spleens taken out
783332 785160 by some camel vet in Sinai.
785354 787257 What about the six who are<br />with the Canadians?
788940 791268 We've got sixty in the Embassy<br />with guns to their heads right now.
791269 792538 The whole world is<br />watching the Embassy.
792539 794021 That makes them safer<br />than the six on the street.
794031 796362 Bonnie Sauder's saying<br />it will be over in twenty-four hours.
800070 801310 We leave the six where they are.
801810 803310 I'll go brief the President.
805784 807604 Right, I'll through it.
835970 839698 <i>Iran's Revolutionary Guard, has<br />rounded up a gang of terrorist blamed
839705 843525 <i>for one murder of a half-dozen<br />followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.
844050 847769 <i>It says security at Khomeini's home<br />now has been raised.
847770 852699 <i>This by the way, is the 69th day that the<br />American hostages have been held in Tehran,
852700 856370 <i>there is no change reported<br />in the hostage situation.
856570 860274 <i>In this country, George Mitty died last<br />night, he was eighty five years old.
862000 863000 Yeah.
864660 865460 Yes.
868675 869410 What?
869650 872150 <i>To begin with, of course,<br />we wanted to learn
872250 875609 <i>about the hostages held in<br />the American Embassy compound.
875610 879250 <i>They may not understand what their<br />ordeal means to their countrymen.
879350 881780 <i>That this nation,<br />their nation, is outraged.
881839 884336 <i>And we cannot really<br />know what it is like
884350 887050 <i>inside the prison<br />that was once our embassy.
887480 891922 <i>Actions of Iran have shocked<br />the civilized world.
892280 897770 <i>Our embassy has been seized, and<br />more than sixty American citizens
897807 899680 <i>continue to be held as hostages,-
899681 903880 <i>As the situation in Iran this morning<br />is unchanged for the hostages,-
904180 907350 <i>the NBC situation in Iran<br />has changed however-
918617 919464 What happened?
920520 922830 Six of them went out a back exit.
923230 924689 Brits turned them away,
924690 927430 Kiwis turned them away,<br />Canadians took 'em in.
927630 929750 Traffic calls them 'House Guests'.
929802 933199 They haven't left the Canadian<br />Ambassador's house since it happened.
933200 934718 Why didn't we get them ten weeks ago?
934719 935550 Too dangerous.
935582 939120 We got revolutionary guards going<br />door to door, like Jehovah's Witnesses.
939260 942829 Half of them think that Khomeini's been<br />too lenient on the ones in the Embassy.
942830 943939 What about the White House?
944030 946600 Carter's shitting enough bricks<br />to build the pyramids.
946950 948599 The Canadians are done,
948600 950088 they say they're baring too much risk.
950089 952150 Their Foreign Secretary<br />corners Vance in Brussels,
952151 954949 and told him she wants<br />the six of them out.
954950 955970 Who else knows?
956000 957369 Just the families.
957370 959519 Meanwhile, some genius in our Embassy
959520 961920 was keeping a mug book on<br />everybody who worked there.
962060 963460 Jesus Christ!
963478 965799 We think it got shredded<br />before they got in.
965800 967919 But now the bastards are using
967920 970399 sweatshop kids<br />to reassemble the shreds.
970400 973859 Once they reassemble that book,<br />they'll know six Americans got out
973860 975460 and they'll know what they look like.
975461 977999 Standing room only for<br />beheadings in the square.
978000 979120 Who's handling?
980000 982000 State is coordinating in-house.
982890 983750 State?
984690 985750 They don't do exfil's.
985751 986829 They do now.
986830 989570 They wanna run it by us,<br />strictly as consultants.
989660 991630 Engell says, it's a lose-lose.
991770 993060 These people die,
993061 995060 they die badly, publicly.
995490 996770 State wants the blame,
996860 997800 we'll give it to 'em.
998630 1000030 What does he want me here for?
1000200 1003460 So he can tell State<br />he ran it by his best exfil guy.
1009800 1011000 Okay.
1011460 1014289 This is Bob Pender from State OS,
1014290 1016290 he's been talking<br />to Morgan, an ex-staff.
1017520 1018290 Thank you.
1019260 1020060 Alright.
1020860 1023970 Mark and Cora Lijek,<br />twenty-nine and twenty-five,
1023971 1027260 he's a Consular Officer, she's<br />an assistant, newly weds,
1027550 1030150 They uh… only just got<br />there a couple months ago,
1030490 1034119 No language skills<br />or in-country knowledge.
1034120 1035519 Henry Lee Schatz,
1035570 1037859 Agricultural attaché from Idaho,
1037860 1039860 a bit of an oddball apparently,
1039950 1043460 he was there to sell U.S.<br />tractors to Iranian agro.
1043570 1045660 Joe Stafford, late twenties
1045890 1046770 he's smart
1046920 1048860 and a climber, speaks Farsi,
1049260 1051260 he arranged the hire of his wife,
1051490 1052319 Kathy.
1052320 1053660 The Embassy was understaffed,
1053661 1055660 so the faculty wives<br />were the typing pool.
1055661 1056970 And Bob Anders,
1057030 1059349 senior consular officer,<br />oldest of the group,
1059350 1061120 and most likely to be group leader.
1061121 1063750 They've been hiding at the<br />Canadian Ambassador's residence.
1064290 1068169 Fortunately, we do not believe the<br />Iranians are aware the six have escaped.
1068170 1068970 So…
1069835 1072660 What we'd like for this are bicycles.
1073170 1076150 We've identified back roads<br />from the Chamran district,
1076151 1078489 couple of rat lines<br />through the mountains
1078490 1080059 to the crossing near Tabriz.
1080060 1082149 Cars are off the table,
1082150 1083628 because of the road blocks.
1083629 1085088 We wait until the weather clears up,
1085089 1086460 then deliver the six bikes,
1086461 1088460 provide them with maps<br />to the Turkish border.
1088461 1090969 We have intelligence,<br />they can ride bicycles
1090970 1093856 or we're prepared to send in<br />somebody to teach 'em.
1101750 1105550 Or you could just send in training wheels<br />and meet them at the border with Gatorade.
1105660 1106460 Tony…
1106950 1109030 It's three hundred miles<br />to the Turkish border.
1109200 1111829 They'd need a support team<br />following them with a tire pump.
1111830 1115605 We were just asked to sharp shoot this,<br />State is handling the ops.
1115621 1117400 I'm sorry, who is this?
1117520 1119149 Tony is an exfil spesh,
1119150 1121889 he's got a lot of Shah's<br />people out after the fall.
1121890 1124460 Sir, if these people can read or add,
1124660 1127320 pretty soon they're gonna figure out<br />they're six short of a full deck.
1127970 1130428 It's winter. You can't afford<br />to wait around until spring,
1130429 1131950 so it's nice enough<br />to take a bike ride.
1132060 1133950 They only way out<br />of that city is the airport.
1134200 1135748 You build new cover identities for 'em,
1135749 1137920 you send in a Moses, he takes<br />them out on a commercial flight.
1138460 1139805 We've explored those options.
1139813 1142683 You're never gonna get them through<br />airport control, Komiteh own the place.
1142707 1146198 They could pose as reporters, if the<br />government issued seventy something…
1146199 1147148 – Seventy four.<br />– Visas,
1147149 1148970 – for American journalists…<br />– And the Revolutionary Guards
1148971 1150549 keep them on seventy four leashes.
1150550 1152550 If they're caught with<br />fake journalist creds,
1152666 1154690 it's Peter and Jane's head<br />in a noose in an hour.
1154691 1157489 Look, North America accents<br />gives us limited options,
1157490 1159093 so we get the Canadians<br />to issue them passports.
1159094 1161670 What about English teachers<br />at the international school?
1161686 1163868 It's a good idea, but that school's<br />been closed for eight months.
1163869 1166430 Okay, so how about<br />'the do-gooders'?
1168120 1169602 Six Canadians have been over there
1169610 1172000 inspecting crops, ensuring the kids<br />are getting enough to eat,
1172001 1174770 we give them creds, makes<br />them look like ag' NGOs.
1174920 1176770 It's a 'feed the kids' thing.
1177200 1177658 Okay.
1177659 1178890 Those kids are black.
1179750 1181119 Those are African kids.
1181120 1183199 We can get ethnically appropriate kids.
1183200 1184919 Are there starving kids in Iran?
1184920 1187460 I'm sure there's some<br />skinny kids in Iran.
1187696 1189265 What about missionary?<br />– Or… seeds…
1189321 1190820 called… "seeds of hope".
1190890 1193745 Hold on… Sir, do you have<br />this newspaper in front of you?
1193761 1195341 Would you mind taking a look at it?
1197030 1198400 What's in this picture?
1199030 1199718 Tehran.
1199719 1201090 Right.<br />What's on the ground?
1203690 1205320 – Snow.<br />– Right.
1205460 1209060 So what crops are the 'do-gooders'<br />inspecting under frosting?
1210860 1211550 Sir…
1212320 1214000 Exfils are like abortions.
1214290 1215630 You don't wanna need one.
1215970 1218520 But when you do,<br />you don't do it yourself.
1223970 1225430 You have a better plan?
1226660 1227704 No Sir.
1231370 1233899 <i>What ever the conflicting<br />signals from Iran today,
1233907 1235367 <i>for that matter everyday,
1235375 1239089 <i>about whether the hostages will<br />or will not be tried as spies,
1239090 1243000 <i>the government of the United States<br />has not deviated from its basic demands:
1243170 1244957 <i>the hostages must be freed.
1244958 1246200 .. to defend human rights,
1246201 1248289 it not only does not defend them,
1248290 1251029 it violates them for all nations.
1251030 1256089 We demand extradition of a man<br />who for more than 37 years,
1256090 1259380 with the United States support,<br />has killed months old babies
1259381 1261119 in the arms of their mothers.
1261120 1265319 <i>He said that if the Americans try<br />military force to rescue the hostages,

1269890 1273182 <i>Americans were outraged<br />at Iran and anyone Iranian.

1276121 1279547 <i>An Iranian flag was burned,<br />while Anti-Iranians demonstrators
1279555 1282148 <i>gathered near the Iranian<br />Consulate. The demonstrators-

1285660 1288768 They knew exactly what<br />was going on, they knew it.
1288769 1291338 But I don't understand wha-<br />what they should do now,
1291354 1294010 send them back, just to-<br />to be tortured and killed?
1294011 1295814 I don't think that justice<br />is the worst thing.
1295815 1299585 <i>When did people first tell you<br />that torture was going on in Iran?
1299590 1301135 <i>They would never come to me and say:
1301151 1303889 <i>"Well Sir, we have tortured this fellow".

1311320 1314032 Why didn't he have a choice,<br />why do you think he didn't have a choice?
1314040 1315888 Because he would have been<br />referred to as a barbarian.
1315889 1316910 – Please!<br />– That's why they're stating
1316918 1318550 he liked the current regime!

1399350 1400149 Hello?
1400150 1401090 My man!
1401370 1402460 I'll get mom.
1403174 1404243 I'm calling for you.
1406520 1408060 Did you do your homework tonight?
1408230 1409200 Yeah it was easy.
1409690 1411199 Excellent.<br />What are we watching?
1411223 1412623 Battle for the Planet of the Apes.
1413430 1414830 Tell me, what channel is it on?
1415150 1415970 Five.
1420570 1421350 Alright.
1423260 1424721 What did you do at school today?
1424860 1426460 Nothing, I don't know.<br />Nothing.
1428570 1431260 It can't be nothing.<br />Something must've happened.
1431330 1433034 After school I've traded baseball cards,-
1433082 1434288 Hmm-Hmm…
1452388 1454914 Ok you know those science<br />fiction, Star Trek, Star Wars,
1454922 1456770 they need an exotic location to shoot,
1456771 1458770 Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know…
1459320 1460500 Now image this.
1461830 1465950 They're a Canadian film crew on a location<br />scout for a science fiction movie.
1466520 1467690 We put it out there,
1467860 1469690 the Canadian producers<br />put it out there.
1469800 1472230 They were looking at Egypt, Istanbul.
1472970 1476920 Then we go to the Consulate and say:<br />'Hey, we want to look in Iran too'.
1477320 1480630 I fly into Tehran, we all fly<br />out together as a film crew.
1481170 1481750 Done.
1481751 1484098 Flamboyant cover identity<br />should be avoided
1484106 1485804 as it increases operational visibility.
1485812 1487206 This is a lot more<br />plausible than foreigners
1487214 1488748 who wanna become teachers in Iran.
1488749 1491458 You want to blend in with the population<br />you don't look like a rodeo clown.
1491459 1494288 Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning<br />and be in the movie business?
1494289 1496120 We already have credentials<br />for the teachers.
1496200 1497598 No Sir, we have a contact in-
1497599 1498998 – Chambers.<br />– John Chambers,
1498999 1501425 he's a Hollywood prosthetics guy, he's got<br />an Oscar, he did Planet of the Apes
1501433 1503690 he's done a bunch of contract<br />work for us in the past.
1504570 1506430 I go see him, he sets this up.
1506431 1508520 One, two days, make it look real.
1523600 1525030 I went outside for thirty seconds.
1525290 1525768 Alright?
1525769 1527660 Could you give me a break?<br />I can't breath in this house.
1527661 1529719 I need some fresh air,<br />I can't- I can't breath!
1529720 1530968 Stay inside the fucking house!
1530969 1532101 Who saw me go outside, I'm just curious?
1532109 1533474 – That's not the point.<br />– That's not the point Bob.
1533490 1534972 Doesn't matter if I saw you<br />go out or you see me.
1534980 1536797 – Did you see me go out?<br />– No! You did go outside…
1536805 1538645 I did. Okay, I saw you.
1538653 1541890 Bob, it only takes one<br />second for them to spot you.
1546890 1548970 Some Americans are missing.
1549370 1551367 Look at the repaired list<br />of embassy employees.
1552200 1553720 The numbers don't match.
1554030 1557400 Finish assembling the<br />pictures from the Embassy.
1557520 1560030 All I need is their faces<br />and I will find them.
1560090 1561890 Yes Sir, it'll be done.
1574150 1575770 We want you to go to LA.
1575920 1578950 If you can make the movie thing<br />credible, we'll take it to the director.
1580150 1580950 Don't fuck up.
1581750 1583430 The whole country is watching you.
1584320 1585660 They just don't know it.
1593230 1594950 My creation…
1596000 1597460 My creation!
1603970 1605030 What the fuck, Bryan?
1605031 1606660 – Cut!<br />– We are cutting!
1610120 1611290 Chambers!
1611350 1613290 John Chambers make up!
1624970 1628660 He says the minotaur prosthetic<br />is too tight so he can't act.
1629320 1631770 If he could act, he wouldn't<br />be playing a minotaur.
1637970 1639090 Mr. Chambers…
1640060 1641090 Kevin Arkins.
1643430 1644460 Hey Tony.
1670570 1671970 What are you shooting?
1672460 1673970 Monster movie.
1675150 1677350 Yeah? Any good?
1678030 1679690 Target audience will hate it.
1679890 1681690 Who's the target audience?
1681770 1682750 People with eyes.
1685950 1686920 Talk to me.
1689120 1690230 It's an exfil.
1690630 1691490 From where?
1692890 1694550 Worst place you can think of.
1694750 1696550 Universal Studio.
1702660 1704430 How are you gonna get in the Embassy?
1704570 1705690 They're not in the Embassy.
1705890 1708000 During the takeover six people escaped.
1708170 1710000 They're hiding out in Tehran…
1710699 1711990 and that's who I'm gonna go get.
1712013 1713293 What am I making?
1714460 1716410 I need you to help me<br />make a fake movie.
1716450 1718770 Well, you're in the right place.
1719370 1722519 I wanna setup a production company<br />and build a cover around making a movie.
1722520 1724520 – That we're not gonna make.<br />– No.
1725120 1727536 So you wanna come to<br />Hollywood and act like a big shot,
1727537 1728046 Yeah.
1728054 1729673 – without actually doing anything.<br />– No.
1729690 1731000 You'll fit right in.
1737200 1738460 Let's see.
1739518 1742829 Well this one has got an M.A. in English,<br />she should be your screenwriter.
1742830 1746000 Sometimes they go along on scouts<br />because they want their free meals.
1746060 1747520 Here's your director.
1747970 1750090 Can you teach somebody<br />to be a director in a day?
1750091 1752800 You teach a recess monkey<br />to be a director in a day.
1753290 1756290 Look if you're gonna do this,<br />you gotta do it.
1756490 1758920 The Kominiacs are fruit loops,<br />but they got cousins
1758932 1761660 who sell prayer rugs<br />and A-tracks on Le Brea.
1762260 1765690 You can't build cover stories<br />around a movie that doesn't exist.
1765860 1768030 You need a script, you need a producer.
1768120 1769060 Make me a producer.
1769170 1772000 No. You're… an<br />associate producer at best.
1773550 1776550 You're gonna do a 20 million<br />dollars Star Wars rip-off.
1776800 1780260 You need somebody who's a somebody,<br />to put their name on it.
1780600 1782260 Somebody respectable…
1783770 1784690 with credits…
1786030 1788490 who you can trust<br />with classified information…
1789600 1791660 who'd produce a fake movie…
1792490 1793660 for free.
1807290 1809030 Hi, I only got a couple of minutes.
1809060 1810800 I'm getting a lifetime<br />achievement award.
1810890 1812120 Mazel tov, Lester.
1812520 1815890 I'd rather stay home and count<br />the wrinkles on my dog's balls.
1816460 1817430 Okay.
1817570 1820607 You got six people hiding out<br />in a town of what… 4 million people,
1820615 1824460 all of whom chant death to<br />America' all the live long day.
1824600 1826430 You want to set up a movie in a week,
1826490 1829950 you want to lie to Hollywood,<br />a town where everybody lies for a living,
1830060 1832660 then you're gonna sneak 007 over here,
1832750 1836200 into a country that wants CIA<br />blood on their breakfast cereal,
1836222 1839860 and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch<br />out of the most watched city in the world.
1840060 1842860 That's about a hundred militia<br />at the airport. That's right.
1844260 1845320 Right.
1847320 1849060 Look I… I got to tell ya,
1849200 1852950 we- we did suicide missions in the<br />Army that had better odds than this.
1853030 1854460 Sir, the car is here.
1862460 1865030 You ever think, Lester,<br />this is all for the cameras?
1865770 1868560 Well, they're getting the ratings,<br />I'll say that for them.
1880660 1882388 We're going to need a script.
1912550 1913490 I love you.
1923460 1925630 Sahar, how are you doing?
1926350 1927830 Fine, thank you.
1929350 1931538 Your friends from Canada, ma'am,
1931657 1933570 all this time, they never go out.
1948770 1950244 Sahar knows.
1954150 1956120 How about 'The Horses of Achilles'?
1956200 1959060 Νо gооd. Νоbоdy dоеѕ wеѕtеrnѕ аnymоrе.
1959150 1960350 It's ancient Troy.
1960596 1962570 If it's got horses in it,<br />it's a western.
1963550 1964860 Hey, Kenny please?
1965000 1967120 Yeah it's John Chambers,<br />about the office space.
1967170 1968260 It doesn't matter.
1968600 1969690 It's a fake movie.
1969800 1972690 If I'm doing a fake movie,<br />it's going to be a fake hit.
1973520 1977230 Cardinal wants all cover options<br />on his desk Friday morning.
1977290 1980800 Engell's prepping the bikes option,<br />teachers option,
1980830 1983230 you have 72 hours to make yours better.
1984550 1985381 Fine.
2010260 2013750 Hey is 8006 still on the open list?
2015090 2016090 Yeah I'll hold.
2016320 2018200 Fade in on a starship landing.

2028170 2030017 It's a turnaround, it's dog shit.
2030025 2032390 It's a space movie in the Middle East.<br />Does it matter if-
2032400 2033490 Could we get the option?
2034170 2035460 Why do we need the option?
2035890 2037460 You're worried about the Ayatollah?
2037570 2039460 Try the WGA.
2041770 2042950 Just let me do the talking.
2043120 2046673 I've known this guy for 25 years,<br />he's full of shit, and he comes on hard,
2046689 2048600 but uh… I can handle it.
2050400 2052950 You want to go into production<br />with this in one month?
2053060 2054690 Up like a carny ride.
2054750 2055770 One month, yeah.
2055950 2058430 – Who are you again?<br />– Kevin Arkins, Studio 6 Films.
2058570 2059370 He's the money.
2060120 2062000 Look, what d'you say uh…
2062060 2065520 fifteen thou'and, let's close on this?
2067150 2068860 You want me to be honest with you, Les?
2068950 2071230 No. I would like you to bullshit me, Max.
2071800 2072350 Alright.
2073630 2075750 I enjoyed your films, the early ones.
2076320 2080490 I took this meeting out of respect,<br />because I wanted to say no to your face.
2081690 2083570 Thank you. Very respectful.
2083630 2085200 You're finished, Lester.
2085550 2088170 Get your cataracts fixed,<br />read the trades.
2088750 2091290 MGM just capitalized for six new films.
2091430 2093430 They're screaming for Sci-Fi.
2094120 2096770 They're offering me four times<br />what you guys are offering me.
2098830 2101260 Well… what can I say?
2102120 2103520 Congratulations.
2104570 2105890 But see,
2106230 2109060 it kind of worries me what you<br />said, let me tell you why.
2109890 2113750 Couple of weeks ago I was sitting<br />at Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai,
2113860 2115570 when my pal, Warren Beatty comes in,
2115690 2117920 he wishes me well,<br />we have a little chat.
2118370 2121170 Seems he was attached<br />to star in 'Zulu Empire',
2121350 2123550 which was just gonna anchor<br />that MGM slate.
2123890 2126920 But Warren confided in me that<br />the picture's gone over budget
2126960 2130000 because the Zulu extras<br />want to unionize.
2130150 2134200 They may be cannibals, but they want<br />health and dental so the movie's kaput!
2134370 2137750 Which means that the MGM<br />deal ain't gonna happen,
2137772 2140950 and your script ain't worth<br />a buffalo shit on a nickel!
2141350 2145030 So, the way it looks to me through<br />the cataracts I grant you,
2145120 2147030 is that you can either sign here,
2147060 2150150 and take 10,000 dollars<br />for your toilet-paper script,
2150260 2152150 or you can go fuck yourself!
2153430 2154920 With all due respect.
2161750 2163090 You really know Warren Beatty?
2163350 2164288 Yes I do.
2164289 2166690 I took a leak next to him<br />once at the Golder Globes.
2167890 2168690 Taco?
2187430 2188800 Got any kids, Lester?
2190000 2191860 Yeah, I have two daughters.
2193370 2194430 See 'em much?
2195150 2197000 I talk to 'em once a year…
2197690 2198513 maybe.
2198550 2199400 Why is that?
2203230 2204890 I was a terrible father.
2207120 2208630 The bullshit business…
2209430 2212062 it's like coal mining, you- you<br />come home to your wife and kids,
2212070 2214120 you can't… you can't wash it off.
2215950 2216660 You?
2218382 2219502 Yeah I got a son.
2221120 2222970 He lives in Virgina with his mother.
2227060 2228120 You're divorced?
2229150 2230370 Taking time off.
2232950 2234230 He needs to be, you know…
2235320 2236370 where he is.
2238720 2240200 Kids need the mother.
2249350 2253660 They caught the Shah's chief of security<br />trying to get on a plane to Paris.
2255120 2255890 Listen,
2256090 2259950 "since the incident, the number<br />of guards at the airport has doubled,
2260060 2263459 a thorough background examination<br />should be expected".
2263460 2265061 The movie cover isn't strong enough yet,
2265062 2266570 I need another week, Jack.
2266770 2267800 You don't have it.
2270970 2272260 We got an office,
2272520 2273950 we got business cards,
2274920 2276350 we got a poster.
2277660 2280660 If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, there's<br />nothing we couldn't have made at home.
2281120 2283260 Six people's lives depend on this.
2284800 2285600 It's not enough.
2285750 2288630 If we're gonna fool these people,<br />it has to be big,
2288770 2291290 and it has to have something<br />that says it's authentic.
2292750 2295350 I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.
2296770 2299060 If you want to sell a lie…
2300200 2302690 get the press to sell it for you.
2303600 2307260 No no no, press event, then they're-<br />they're gonna read through the script.
2307550 2311400 I got a bunch of actors who are gonna read<br />from beginning to end, all the way through.
2311570 2313550 They have costumes and everything.
2313720 2317490 No, no, no, I can't, I got, uh,<br />Variety has the exclusive on that.
2317570 2320830 Any way to make this more uh…<br />Middle Eastern?
2321350 2323170 Mesopotamia?<br />Egypt?
2323550 2324370 Iran.
2324400 2328090 Look, I can get you in, but you<br />gotta promise me at least half a page.
2328260 2331490 No, no, this thing's an event,<br />it's going to be a spectacle.
2393290 2394060 Lester.
2394170 2397150 Nina, you look fabulous!
2397290 2398370 You doing the reading?
2398460 2400689 I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.
2400690 2402120 Great, I'll call ya.
2404230 2406890 Keep that fucking space<br />witch away from me.
2407120 2407970 You know her?
2408290 2409400 I was married to her.
2409520 2411400 Oh my God, Iraq is amazing!
2411460 2412460 Well, we're shooting in Iran.
2412570 2414090 Iran with an N?
2414230 2415750 Yeah.<br />We're very excited.
2415830 2417230 You ever watch the news?
2417320 2419230 What does the title refer to?
2419830 2421230 The Argo!
2421370 2422230 The thing…
2422630 2424400 Like Jason and the<br />Golden Fleece, or what?
2424401 2427232 No, no, it's the ship, it's the-<br />the spaceship, it goes…
2427335 2430000 it goes everywhere, it goes all…
2430400 2432000 …all throughout space.
2432150 2433350 So it's the Argonaut?
2434090 2434720 No.
2434920 2436200 What- what does Argo mean?
2436290 2437290 I don't know.
2437370 2438350 You don't know?
2438570 2441060 It means "Argo, fuck yourself"!
2442485 2445200 Will you pay me every attention,<br />ladies and gentlemen?
2445436 2449745 If our artists could settle in,<br />we'll just be ready to begin the reading.
2450843 2454420 Argo. From Mary Ann Boyd.

2609792 2612630 First shot of the picture.
2616211 2617382 "Argo, fuck yourself."
2617647 2619441 Argo, fuck yourself.
2642478 2647929 OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY OF STATE<br />JANUARY 25, 1980
2657052 2658176 Brace yourself.
2658210 2661314 It's like talking to those two<br />old fucks from The Muppets.
2665129 2666843 Aliens and robots?
2667994 2668811 Yes, sir.
2669820 2672906 You're telling me that there is a movie<br />company in Hollywood right now,
2673286 2675231 that is funded by the CIA?
2675729 2677282 – Yes, sir.
2678294 2680118 What's wrong with the bikes again?
2680119 2681847 We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.
2681879 2684862 You think… you think this is<br />more plausible than teachers?
2684888 2688296 Yes, we do. One, there are no more<br />foreign teachers in Iran…
2688320 2690444 And we think everybody<br />knows Hollywood people,
2690452 2692459 and everybody knows they<br />ain't shootin' Stalingrad,
2692460 2694443 with Bob Hope directing<br />if it would sell tickets.
2695513 2697470 There are only bad options,
2697984 2700073 it's about finding the best one.
2700347 2702435 You don't have a better<br />bad idea than this?
2702571 2705341 This is the best bad idea we have, sir.
2705834 2706954 By far.
2714914 2719033 The United States Government has just<br />sanctioned your Science Fiction movie.
2719898 2721829 Thank you, sir.
2757526 2763217 I'm required to remind you that if you are<br />detained, the agency will not claim you.
2764138 2766296 Barely claim me as it is.
2767431 2769648 Is there any in case of obstacle?
2769746 2772538 Just Christine.
2774677 2776885 I should have brought some<br />books to read in prison.
2777034 2777968 No.
2778376 2780697 They'll kill you long before prison.
2782408 2784295 – Thanks for the ride.<br />– Yeah.
2794007 2796612 – Studio 6.<br />– We got a green light.
2796640 2798915 Keep the office running<br />until you hear otherwise.

2868223 2869125 Hey.
2869392 2870165 Hey.
2871706 2873014 Come to bed.
2873939 2875723 Another 5 minutes.
2886762 2889159 She pleaded with me.
2889895 2892858 When it started in the streets<br />nine months ago, she…
2894266 2896875 she begged for us to leave.
2897758 2900194 She packed our bags.
2900282 2903880 I said, "just- just a little bit longer".
2906471 2909686 And all I was thinking was…
2910602 2912663 "stay…
2913030 2914854 this is good for me.
2916164 2917455 Stay.
2920770 2923228 Show Newsom you got the balls".
2928221 2931417 I can't believe I put Kathy<br />in this position.

2999153 3001490 Can't be right all the time.
3001831 3003168 Kevin?
3003185 3004820 When did you get back?
3005791 3009101 The Shah escaped on the 747<br />so laden with gold bars,
3009119 3011456 that they didn't make it off the runway.
3011774 3013109 But you kept busy.
3013211 3017490 Fairing out the torture apparatus<br />of our friends fallen dictation.
3018299 3019935 It's getting worse.
3019967 3023522 Anyone that lands at Mehrabad<br />now fills in one of these.
3024230 3026156 This strip makes a copy<br />to the one underneath,
3026207 3028625 passenger keeps yellow,<br />airport keeps white,
3028633 3030182 when you leave the country,<br />they match them up
3030183 3032475 to verify you came into the country<br />when you say you did.
3032511 3033873 So if they look,
3034082 3036620 they'll see I didn't come into<br />the country with six people.
3037096 3038895 If they look.
3041136 3044095 When you land, you should go straight<br />to the Ministry of Culture and…
3044414 3047339 Islamic Guidance, kiss the ring.
3047793 3051030 Get on record as having<br />applied for film permit.
3051173 3054947 If they catch you later, at least they'll<br />be confused while they're torturing you.
3057818 3061676 IRANIAN CONSULATE - TURKEY
3072822 3075243 What will be the purpose<br />of your visit to Iran?
3075298 3078800 Uh… film production. Business.
3080788 3083727 Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?
3084940 3088652 Well, I would have loved to, except my<br />boss didn't send a telex until I got here.
3089333 3093032 If the guy had an intelligent thought<br />in his head, it would die of loneliness.
3113777 3115865 The Times and AP found out six escaped.
3116814 3119835 They know who they are, and they know<br />they're hiding out with the Canadians.
3120352 3122032 Somebody withdrew on the family's talk.
3122058 3123238 Mother of God.
3123383 3126239 Yeah I just put Vance on a plane to<br />take the head of eds to a circus,
3126261 3128846 he thinks he can get him<br />to sit on it for now.
3130278 3132352 You guy'd better get them.
3132710 3134544 And get the hell out.
3134886 3138299 The Captain has informed us<br />that we're entering Iranian airspace.
3138436 3142166 We'll be coming through to collect<br />any remaining alcoholic beverages.
3301293 3303593 This film crew is just yourself?
3303701 3306378 No, we have six more from<br />Canada meeting us today.
3306514 3308612 You'd like to film at the bazaar?
3308931 3311392 The bazaar, maybe the palace.
3311640 3313310 Landmark sites.
3313588 3314923 I see.
3315953 3317873 The exotic orients.
3318261 3321076 Snake charmers, flying carpets.
3322445 3325046 You came to us at a complicated time.
3325603 3328624 Before the revolution forty percent<br />of the movie theaters in Tehran
3328629 3330406 were showing pornograph.
3330839 3332093 I understand.
3332204 3335215 The function of this<br />office is purification,
3335533 3338593 as well as promotion for the arts.
3340062 3342734 I'll review this for the Ministry.
3344036 3345497 Thank you.
3345520 3347575 – Salam.<br />– Salam.
3353481 3356161 Lester, you're working late.
3356293 3358138 Until the dawns early light.
3358458 3362417 You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.
3362473 3366388 Well, I'm a hundred and fifty years<br />old, so you wouldn't be me for long.
3375222 3377568 – Ambassador.<br />– Ken Taylor.
3377662 3379523 Thank you for what you're doing.
3379859 3383159 I was expecting more of a G-Man look.
3383665 3386183 I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.
3386476 3388164 Ah. This way.
3401022 3403277 These are blank- you know, stamps…
3403454 3405539 Yeah, I'll take care of this.
3406712 3408229 How long?
3408591 3411088 A day to prep their covers…<br />two if they need it.
3411136 3412793 And- and you'll fly out with them?
3412868 3414242 Yeah.
3414757 3416349 There's something you should know.
3416662 3419755 We think our housekeeper's<br />figured out who they are.
3420415 3424809 We don't know if we can trust her.<br />So, sooner is better.
3474704 3476139 Hi.
3476228 3478178 Hi. My name's Kevin Harkins…
3479208 3480853 and I'm gonna get you home.
3482194 3485097 These are the screenplays<br />for your cover identities.
3486629 3488905 It's- it's theater of the absurd.
3488943 3490381 What are our chances?
3490489 3491864 Chances are good.
3491959 3495106 Good? Well, what's the uh…<br />what's the number value of good?
3495156 3498172 A thirty percent chance of<br />being publicly executed?
3498282 3501430 Can you- can you tell me what the<br />objection was to normal cover identities?
3501498 3503644 There are no Canadians in<br />the country for no reason.
3503725 3505026 They'll sniff us out regardless.
3505060 3508059 The Swedish Consul, they- they accused him<br />of being an American at the airport,
3508060 3509248 they held him for an hour.
3509254 3512303 We can't hold upon that, we don't know<br />what the hell movie people do.
3512304 3514381 That's why I'm here.
3514423 3517311 I'm gonna help you, I'm gonna be<br />with you the whole way. This is what I do.
3518266 3520604 Have you gotten people<br />out this way before?
3521209 3523393 This would be a first.
3524423 3527488 Do you know that everyday they catch<br />another friend of the Shah at the airport?
3527514 3529439 – Joe…<br />– Kangaroo trials, and-
3529448 3532829 And then firing squads just for having<br />American names in their phone books.
3533284 3534726 You've been here and hour,
3534983 3537956 and- and you're asking us to trust<br />you with our lives, Mr…
3538038 3539439 Harkins.
3539694 3541721 That's your real name?
3541825 3543100 No.
3545889 3549727 I know there are risks involved.<br />Serious risks.
3550246 3553223 But it is time to go.
3554285 3556814 We've got orders to close<br />the embassy and go back.
3556934 3559140 There's nowhere for them to stay.
3559847 3562821 We will never make it through<br />immigration at the airport.
3562956 3564471 I'm serious.
3564527 3568207 I mean no, this is what? The part we say,<br />this is so crazy it might actually work?
3568215 3570210 – Come on!<br />– I saw in Burma, they get people out.
3570218 3573345 Snitches and Banana Republic, they get<br />them over the border after the coup,
3573353 3575620 pay the guards at the crossing a<br />hundred bucks to look the other way.
3575636 3577755 You know, his opinion got us out<br />in the first place.
3577844 3581738 If we go out there with fake passports,<br />we are spies, period, that's execution.
3581754 3583074 You got a problem lying, Joe?
3583085 3585034 But the point is, we can't stay here!
3585322 3588700 If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial<br />for harboring the enemy, you know that.
3588863 3591808 Pat and I have discussed this,<br />it's the risk we took.
3592578 3595583 That man out there has got bad<br />cards and he is going to lose,
3595593 3598573 and if he loses… it's our lives.
3599959 3602937 And his life too.
3603140 3605822 Look, we don't have any alternatives.
3605947 3608218 We gotta go.
3613282 3616828 These cover identities were created<br />specifically for each one of you.
3617103 3619636 What you need to do is memorize<br />everything that's inside.
3619762 3623834 Who you are, what you are, where you've<br />been, complete bio. And then add to that:
3624127 3627358 where do you vacation, what are you<br />allergies, who'd you have an affair with.
3627621 3628872 The only way this works,
3628998 3632428 is if you believe that you're these people<br />so much that you're dream like them.
3633696 3635847 Get started tonight.
3635884 3638863 I'll be back tomorrow. We'll get going.<br />Good luck.
3644568 3646503 Wow, my guy kind of sucks.
3646600 3648115 What's your name?
3648510 3651198 Mike McEwan A.
3651624 3652944 Sounds convincing.
3652972 3655063 Kathy, what's your name?
3682749 3685734 The Loveboat will be seeing<br />fifteen minutes from now.
3687185 3689672 .. insisted that the crisis in Afghanistan
3689683 3693516 will not divert the attention of the United<br />States from the plight of the hostages.
3693550 3696778 .. he seems to be if not impotent,<br />but at least reluctant…
3696968 3700402 The United States finds itself<br />in such bitter confrontation
3700410 3704534 with the Soviet Union over that<br />country's invasion of Afghanistan…
3704841 3707265 The United States is now<br />moving towards the decision
3707266 3709767 to boycott the summer<br />Olympics in Moscow.
3710721 3714492 Bad new, bad news. Even when<br />it's good news, it's bad news.
3714558 3718209 John Wayne's in the ground six months,<br />this is what's left of America.
3746580 3748849 The Minister of Culture and Guidance
3748850 3750381 has approved your location scout.
3750416 3751910 He will send his representative
3751911 3755451 to meet you and your crew at the<br />Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 P.M.
3756378 3758214 They called your bluff.
3758560 3761038 – Maybe they're cooperating.<br />– Absolutely not.
3761204 3765877 Seven Americans walking the bazaar<br />is asking for a riot, it's the hive.
3766147 3767505 Seven Canadians, Jack.
3767547 3770891 Never give them opening shots at a cover.
3771530 3774188 – Are they even ready?<br />– They're getting there.
3774425 3776407 There's no prize for most improvements.
3776432 3777329 I don't have a choice.
3777337 3780431 We say no, they show up at their residence<br />and drag everyone out at gun point.
3780454 3782296 How well do you think their<br />covers are gonna hold up
3782297 3784266 when they're getting their<br />fingernails pulled out?
3804032 3808237 You want us to go the Grand Bazaar<br />at three o'clock in the afternoon?
3808794 3811514 You said a day learning our cover<br />then straight to the airport.
3811625 3812918 – Do they suspect something?
3813341 3816601 What I know is we need to<br />pretend to be a movie crew.
3816693 3820743 We go to the bazaar today, we<br />fly from the airport tomorrow.
3822162 3823983 We won't do it.
3825427 3828440 He told them that there are six of<br />us, so then they're expecting six,
3828458 3830020 it would be suspicious not<br />to show up at this point.
3830049 3831961 Goddammit, guys! What else<br />do we have to do?!
3832292 3833789 Alright? What el- what-<br />what's the alternative?!
3833797 3835539 We don't have to show them<br />the only cards we're holding,
3835540 3836837 which is that they<br />don't know we're here!
3836845 3839279 I get it! That's the ball game,<br />okay, we- you know,
3839326 3841897 Look, we don't have any other…<br />other choice! What are we gonna do?!
3841902 3844533 Who says that we'll know<br />our covers well enough?
3844553 3846095 We're no in the CIA!
3847214 3848577 It's suicide.
3848905 3851124 I'm asking you to trust me.
3852316 3854855 I don't trust you.
3856143 3857599 This is the game, Joe.
3857700 3858837 What world are you living in?
3858933 3859912 What world am I…?
3859931 3862754 The one where they're hanging people<br />from construction cranes, Bob!
3862755 3864104 It's too dangerous,
3864143 3866703 – I don't want to bring my wife into this.<br />– Joe, can you stop?
3867783 3869323 Joe?
3875606 3877523 So, we'll see you at two.
3900611 3905947 So, don't be recognizable, but look<br />exactly like your passport photo.
3906887 3909521 I haven't been this nervous<br />since our wedding.
3911093 3913974 Only this isn't a huge mistake, hopefully.
3914368 3916976 Like this… Okay.
3919230 3920778 Hello?
3923393 3924937 Hello?
3925590 3927338 Hello?
3933499 3935110 Who was that?
3938195 3940129 – Mark?<br />– Yeah?
3941995 3943605 I'm scared.
3946023 3948060 It's okay.
3994819 3996164 Where are they?
3996410 3998291 In the kitchen.
4014685 4016664 This is what I do…
4016691 4018379 I get people out…

4386541 4388076 Sahar.
4399044 4402346 He's saying that the Shah killed<br />his son with an American gun.
4412602 4415226 No! Canada! Cana- Canada!
4415314 4418154 Ι'd lіkе tо ѕuggеѕt thаt<br />wе аrе еndіng thіѕ vіѕіt!

4426928 4428927 You know, sister, those who are with him,
4428977 4431964 Rasool Allah, we are tender with them.
4432330 4434325 But stern against the infidels.
4434417 4436547 With God's will.
4437377 4440984 But those who sit silently have sinned.
4441054 4443689 Yes. Any way I may help, sir?
4444615 4447449 No, only one thing.
4448430 4450990 How long have they been there?
4451259 4452904 Sorry?
4453829 4455206 The guest of the Ambassador…
4455276 4457020 how long have they been here?
4459639 4461479 They arrived two days ago.
4461621 4467177 Forgive my intrusion,<br />we must stay vigilant.
4468217 4470984 Everyone in this house<br />is a friend of Iran.
4505789 4507202 How did it go?
4508739 4511307 What about tomorrow?
4511563 4514047 Tomorrow they'll be ready.
4534996 4539716 A man in Scranton is placing a flag<br />in his lawn for every day of captivity.
4539953 4543572 He runs out of lawn,<br />Kennedy wins the primary.
4543662 4546462 The six with the Canadians are coming out.

4561025 4562482 – Vancouver.<br />– Where were you born?
4562533 4563899 – Toronto<br />– "Torono".
4563923 4565220 Canadians don't pronounce the T.
4565264 4567840 Some Komiteh guard is<br />actually gonna know that?
4567976 4571554 If you're detained for questioning they<br />will bring out someone who knows that, yes.
4571907 4575467 Mary, who were the last three<br />Prime Ministers to Canada?

4601523 4603822 Look, they're gonna try<br />and break you. Okay?
4603863 4605354 By trying to get you agitated.
4605403 4607284 You have to know your<br />resume back to front.
4607314 4609536 Do you really believe your little<br />story's gonna make a difference
4609549 4611927 when there's a gun to our heads?
4612898 4616427 I think my story is the only thing<br />between you and a gun to your head.
4618389 4619812 That's right.
4625582 4628629 Hey. They made it through<br />the location scout.
4640681 4642820 You have a call.
4653326 4656571 – What is it?<br />– Go to black on green.
4658039 4659434 Go.
4659485 4661163 – It all just changed.<br />– What?
4661218 4663025 They're calling it again,<br />you gotta come back.
4663140 4664548 – What?<br />– Flight Chiefs are planning
4664563 4666714 a military rescue of the hostages,
4666737 4670253 Delta Force started training<br />to storm the grounds. So,
4670296 4673000 if the six of them are brought down there,
4673067 4675125 they won't be held for long.
4676118 4679711 Goddammit! I never would have exposed them<br />if I wasn't authorized to get them out!
4679751 4682429 – It's over, Tony.<br />– If they stay here, they will be taken.
4682527 4685308 – Probably not alive.<br />– Listen to me!
4685501 4687136 The thinking has changed.
4687305 4690518 Six Americans get pulled out of<br />the Canadian diplomat's house
4690530 4693034 and executed, it's a world outrage.
4693534 4696798 Six Americans get caught<br />playing movie make-believe
4696807 4699257 with the CIA at the airport and executed,
4699420 4704214 it's a national embarrassment.<br />They are calling the operation.
4706693 4709258 We're responsible for these people.
4710086 4713668 What we are is required to follow orders.
4713884 4715390 I'm sorry.
4732996 4734542 Come in.
4735422 4738381 We're ready to try again.
4739284 4740740 You're ready.
4740906 4742834 You worked hard.
4743294 4746800 Probably the best thing to do<br />for you right now would be…
4746967 4748786 just to relax.
4749311 4750746 Okay.
4751020 4752523 You did good.
4753277 4754784 Thanks.
4780952 4783871 So you know.
4783965 4788147 Exfil wants you to burn the<br />passports before you leave.
4789813 4791686 If you tell them now, they'll panic.
4791705 4794204 I think it's best if you just don't show.
4796342 4798920 It was always a fucked mission.
4799394 4802157 You came closer than anybody else.
4950772 4951960 It's off…
4951973 4954093 they want us to pack up the office.
4956706 4959911 This can wait. Let's go get a drink.
4983967 4985998 He's late.
4999637 5000588 O'Donnell.
5000635 5003619 Somebody's responsible<br />when things happen, Jack.
5004566 5005969 I'm responsible.
5006347 5007913 I'm taking them through.
5008164 5009802 Tony?
5018862 5020550 Alan! Alan,
5020576 5023344 we need to confirm those seven<br />tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.
5023360 5024564 Engell shut that down.
5024610 5026054 I say it's back on!
5026109 5028318 – I can't do it, it's back stopped!<br />– Wait wait, wait a minute!
5028858 5030405 What the hell are you talking<br />about, back stopped,
5030413 5031786 what the hell does that mean?
5031830 5034592 Carter's gotta say yes<br />for us to get the tickets.
5044667 5046067 Time to go.
5056475 5057909 Alright.
5058875 5061560 – Where's Engell?<br />– Uh, he's in a meeting.
5061682 5063504 Pull him out.
5064828 5066000 Pull him out!
5068388 5070276 Thank you. See you soon.
5070286 5071690 Sahar's on the bus.
5071796 5073866 – Great.<br />– Sahar will be fine.
5073914 5076088 – Thank you.<br />– Thank you!
5076113 5077489 You two leave right now.
5077521 5079316 We'll leave on the train in half an hour.
5079356 5080776 Good.
5084272 5085715 And he said no.
5085748 5087842 This is not a long leisure<br />and it never has been,
5087866 5089699 and you don't decide if it goes!
5090118 5091798 It is going!
5091997 5093979 Jack. You are this close.
5094006 5095764 Am I? Am I really that close?
5095811 5097233 You are this Goddamn close to-
5097260 5101564 I am not gonna leave him at the airport<br />with six people and his dick in his hand.
5101653 5103697 You tell the director<br />to call the White House!
5103757 5105519 Do your fucking job!
5113789 5116647 – Get to your plane, Claude<br />– Oui monsieur.
5122149 5125892 First time anyone's gonna ask you<br />a question is at the first check point.
5126092 5128893 The first check point is just to<br />get a look at your passports.
5129224 5132040 Passports came straight from<br />Ottawa last week. They're clean.
5132974 5135104 You're gonna find White<br />House Chief of Staff!
5135187 5136450 How would I find him?
5136578 5139645 We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!
5140181 5143395 The second check point is immigration.
5143750 5145533 You're each gonna hand them one of these.
5145618 5148549 It says that you landed in<br />the country two days ago.
5148655 5151587 They'll look for the matching<br />white one, which doesn't exist.
5151753 5154097 You'll say you don't know what happened…

6346018 6348127 We made history today.

6352846 6354743 Or it's the other way around.
6355003 6356207 And who said it?
6356373 6357826 Marx.
6358536 6361641 Groucho said that?
6364153 6367135 Called 'The Times' to nail<br />it to the Goddamn door.
6367178 6368535 CIA are the good guys.
6368547 6370443 The Canadians are the good guys
6370747 6372999 And if we're not agreeing, them too.
6373041 6377396 Only. Canada takes the credit, or<br />they'll retaliate against the hostages.
6378451 6380347 Great Satan wasn't involved.
6381122 6383173 No CIA.
6383264 6385290 Is that right, Jack?
6387057 6388968 Involved in what?
6389635 6392845 We were surprised as anybody.
6395086 6396945 Thank you, Canada.
6397087 6399615 We knew that each day<br />that they stayed there,
6399616 6401955 the danger was becoming greater.
6402051 6406001 We had been looking for a solution to have<br />them to leave the country during the past-
6406028 6409406 .. Day 87, and finally a sliver<br />of really good news…
6409478 6411965 .. American department of State<br />hereby honors
6412564 6414220 Joe Stafford…
6414829 6416236 Kathy Stafford…
6417767 6419368 Mark Lijek…
6420298 6423106 The Americans will be forever grateful
6423159 6425347 to our great and ally to the North,
6425359 6427983 for the protection and safe passage,
6428081 6429768 provided to our diplomats.
6429880 6431134 – Bob Anders…
6431524 6433941 Here or anywhere in the world…
6434037 6435909 Canada will pay…
6437308 6441172 for this violation of the<br />sovereignty of Iran.
6441297 6445826 .. ambassador Ken Taylor<br />and the great nation of Canada.
6449573 6451837 So I'm sitting in Jerry's this morning,
6451956 6453591 I'm having breakfast.<br />Waitress comes over to me,
6453659 6455464 she's waving a newspaper, she says:
6455514 6457302 'You see what those Canadians pulled off?
6457438 6459548 Why can't we do something like that?"
6459677 6461871 I said to her, do you know what I said?
6462054 6463453 No, what?
6463609 6466241 "Argo, fuck yourself!"
6494210 6495731 All set.
6496049 6497869 Thanks a lot.
6511829 6514590 And I left my autograph book at home.
6519875 6523209 His eminence called me.<br />He wants to see you.
6523466 6525996 Probably wants to fire me himself.
6526372 6529564 He wants to give you<br />the Intelligence Star.
6529846 6531677 You're getting the highest award of merit
6531680 6535360 of the clandestine services<br />of these United States.
6536170 6538092 Ceremony's on the fourteenth.
6538435 6542194 If they push it a week I can bring<br />Ian, that's his winter break.
6543084 6547288 The op was classified. So…<br />the ceremony's classified.
6547374 6551006 He can't know about it,<br />nobody can know about it.
6552137 6555983 So they're just gonna give me an award,<br />then they're gonna take it back.
6556056 6557793 That's right.
6558733 6562174 If we wanted applause we would<br />would have joined the circus.
6562356 6565050 – I thought we did.<br />– Yeah.
6565262 6568665 Carter said you were a great American.
6569042 6570627 Great American what?
6571224 6573047 He didn't say.
6585989 6588712 What happened to your picture?
6588947 6591228 It's in turn around.
6632173 6634553 Can I come in?
6678665 6680907 The Iran hostage crisis<br />ended on January 20, 1981,
6681209 6683766 when all remaining<br />hostages were released.
6684567 6688111 They spent 444 days in captivity.
6688609 6691718 The involvement of the C.I.A. complemented<br />efforts of the Canadian embassy
6692044 6695043 in freeing the six held in Tehran.
6696368 6699048 To this day, this story stands<br />as an enduring model
6699280 6702841 for international cooperation<br />between governments.
6703564 6706290 All of the Houseguests returned to U.S.<br />foreign service
6706456 6709166 after their ordeal in Iran.
6710526 6713230 Oscar winning make-up artist<br />John Chambers was awarded
6713487 6716135 the C.I.A.'s Intelligence medal,<br />its highest civilian honor.
6716746 6719749 He and Mendez remained friends<br />until Chamber's death in 2001.
6720474 6723275 Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star<br />was returned to him in 1997,
6723538 6727038 when operation Argo was declassified<br />by president Clinton.
6735880 6739419 He lives in rural Maryland<br />with his family.
