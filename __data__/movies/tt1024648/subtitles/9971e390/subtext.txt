1142400 1144164 <i>A bit of an oddball, apparently.</i>
1144360 1147569 <i>He was there to sell<br />U.S. tractors to Iranian agro.</i>
1148040 1150327 Joe Stafford. Late 20s.
1150480 1152369 <i>He's smart and a climber.</i>
1152520 1153601 <i>Speaks Farsi.</i>

1156800 1160088 Embassy was understaffed,<br />so the faculty wives were the typing pool.
1160240 1162766 And Bob Anders. Senior consular officer...
1162960 1165531 <i>...oldest of the group<br />and most likely to be group leader.</i>
1165720 1168564 They're in hiding at the Canadian<br />ambassadorâ€™s residence.
1168760 1172526 Fortunately, we do not believe the Iranians<br />are aware the six have escaped.
1172720 1176805 So, what we like for this are bicycles.
1177600 1180604 We've identified back roads<br />from the Shemiran district.
1180760 1183081 A couple of rat lines<br />through the mountains...
1183280 1184566 ...to the crossing near Tabriz.
1184720 1187610 Cars are off the table<br />because of the roadblocks.
1187760 1189330 We wait till the weather clears up...
1189480 1192848 ...then deliver the six bikes, provide them<br />with maps to the Turkish border.
1193040 1195646 <font color="#808080">PENDER:</font><br />We have intelligence they can ride bicycles.
1195840 1198764 Or we're prepared to send in<br />somebody to teach them.

1211600 1213568 It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.

1226440 1229011 Sir, if these people can read or add...
1229200 1232249 ...pretty soon they're gonna figure out<br />they're six short of a full deck.
1232400 1234443 It's winter. You can't<br />afford to wait around till
1234469 1236430 spring so it's nice enough<br />to take a bike ride.
1236560 1240167 The only way out of that city is the airport.<br />Build new cover identities for them...
1240320 1243290 ...you send in a Moses,<br />he takes them out on a commercial flight.

1279440 1282171 It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?
1282320 1284004 Those kids are black.

2338400 2342644 But, see, it kind of worries me,<br />what you said, and let me tell you why.
2343800 2347566 Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at<br />Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...
2347720 2349449 ...when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.
2349600 2351682 He wishes me well, we had a little chat.
2352200 2355170 Seems he was attached<br />to star in <i>Zulu Empire...</i>
2355320 2357527 ...which was gonna anchor that MGM slate.
2357680 2360763 But Warren confided in me<br />that the picture's gone over budget...
2360960 2363850 ...because the Zulu extras wanna unionize.
2364040 2366611 They may be Cannibals,<br />but they want health and dental...
2366800 2368086 ...so the movie's kaput.
2368240 2371449 Which means that the MGM deal<br />ain't gonna happen...
2371600 2374444 ...and your script ain't worth<br />the buffalo shit on a nickel.
2375120 2376884 So the way it looks to me...
2377080 2378889 Through the cataracts, I grant you.
2379080 2380844 ...is that you can either sign here...
2381000 2384004 ...and take $10,000<br />for your toilet paper script...
2384160 2386401 ...or you can go fuck yourself.
