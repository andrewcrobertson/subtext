37587 39797 This is the Persian empire...
40048 42174 ...known today as Iran.
43093 47137 For 2500 years, this land was<br />ruled by a series of kings...
47305 48848 ...known as shahs.
50100 54520 In 1950, the people of Iran<br />elected Mohammad Mosaddegh...
54688 57064 ...a secular democrat,<br />as prime minister.
58316 61485 He nationalized British and<br />U.S. petroleum holdings...
61653 64613 ...returning Iran's oil to its people.
65782 67575 But in 1953...
67742 72371 ...the U.S. and Great Britain engineered<br />a coup d'etat that deposed Mosaddegh...
72539 75541 ...and installed Reza Pahlavi as shah.
76835 80296 The young shah was known<br />for opulence and excess.
80630 83340 His wife was rumored to bathe in milk...
83508 87428 ...while the shah had his lunches<br />flown in by Concorde from Paris.
88889 90264 The people starved.
92893 95769 The shah kept power through<br />his ruthless internal police:
96438 97688 The SAVAK.
98189 101442 An era of torture and fear began.
103737 107114 He then began a campaign<br />to westernize Iran...
108116 111911 ...enraging a mostly<br />traditional Shiite population.
112579 116874 In 1979, the people of<br />Iran overthrew the shah.
118835 123005 The exiled cleric, Ayatollah<br />Khomeini, returned to rule Iran.
126217 130971 It descended into score-settling,<br />death squads and chaos.
134225 137937 Dying of cancer, the shah<br />was given asylum in the U.S.
139856 143525 The Iranian people took to the<br />streets outside the U.S. embassy...
143693 146278 ...demanding that the<br />shah be returned...
146446 147780 ...tried...
148698 150074 ...and hanged.
150241 154078 Based on a true story.
154245 158123 U.S. Embassy, Iran<br />- November 4, 1979
219310 222271 The carnival's a little<br />bigger today, huh?
223815 226734 Windows are supposed to<br />be bulletproof, right?
226901 228944 Well, they've never been tested.
229154 233574 You just need to finish<br />filling out this section here.
233742 235534 We can process your visa.
285376 288921 We need some security. Yes,<br />it's your responsibility.
289089 290297 They're over the walls.
290465 293217 We should all split. I'm<br />gonna close up my office.
313113 314196 Oh, my God.
315156 317324 Marines to Number One. Fall back.
317492 318909 Can anyone hear me?<br />We need help.
318910 320994 I need police right now.<br />Right now, goddamn it!
321162 322830 - Jesus.<br />- Can anybody hear me?
322997 324832 There was a breach.
326251 327668 Just burn everything! Burn it now!
327836 330587 All right, burn everything! All<br />the files, file cabinet, safe.
345478 347646 Let's get a cart over<br />here. Burn it all. Come on.
347814 350691 Burn everything! Burn the<br />classifieds! Everything!
355155 356905 Don't fucking shoot anybody.
357073 359783 You don't wanna be the son<br />of a bitch who started a war.
359951 361743 They need an hour to<br />burn the classified.
362745 363787 I need you to hold.
363955 368000 If you shoot one person, they're gonna<br />kill every single one of us in here.
377177 379887 I'm telling you, if we're<br />going to go, we need to go now.
380054 383640 - Okay, we need to make a decision...<br />- Can we wait until the Iranian police come?
383808 386268 No, the police aren't<br />coming. It's been 45 minutes.
386436 389438 - How do you know?<br />- The police have abandoned their posts.
389606 391840 If the police are not coming,<br />then the army's gonna come.
391908 394443 The prime minister won't let<br />the embassy be taken over.
394611 395988 The prime minister may come tomorrow,
396089 398780 but the Komiteh are here today.<br />So we have to evacuate.
398948 401033 Look at me. No one is coming.
402493 405245 Get the desk drawers.<br />Everything. Don't sort it.
405413 407748 Get it down to the incinerator<br />in the vault! Go, now!
407916 409833 Tear gas as a last resort only.
410001 412336 I repeat: only if your<br />life is under threat.
450124 452918 In here, we are in America right<br />now. Outside, we are in Iran.
453086 455587 - It's on American soil...<br />- I'm not going out into that.
455755 457005 They're not safe here.
457173 460133 If they get caught applying<br />for visas to the U.S.?
460301 463220 Mark, we are in the only building<br />with direct access to the street.
463388 465429 If we're going to go,<br />then we need to go now.
465430 466139 Yeah, I'm in.
466307 467724 - Yeah.<br />- Yeah, let's go.
472814 474856 - I'm going outside.<br />- Why?
475024 476483 To reason with them.
502885 506221 Open the door!
506389 508098 Open the fucking door!
509976 512811 You said you wanted to<br />see the world, right, Tom?
512979 515063 Let me in! Let me in!
523031 524531 Burn it all. Come on.
524699 527451 Get the safe, get the<br />filing cabinets, get it all.
534959 537377 All four drawers, I want<br />them shredded right now.
537545 539338 Not gonna shred fast enough.
539589 542049 Grab the visa plates!
542842 545677 All four! And anything<br />else you see out there.
545887 547637 When in doubt, just shred it!
550141 552768 We got 10 minutes! Let's go,<br />let's go, let's go! Everything!
562278 563320 Get the shredder.
563488 565030 There are no police.
571662 572871 Jesus.
573915 576833 Leave the building, go now.
577001 579086 Iranians go first.
579253 580879 Now, hurry!
590890 596311 Who has made this?!
602610 604277 It's done. They're in.
629679 632931 Okay, come on. We gotta<br />get off the streets.
633099 634641 This way. Up here to the left.
663909 665172 STATE DEPARTMENT<br />- 7TH FLOOR
665173 668508 - These fucks hit us, we can't hit them back?<br />- Mosaddegh, we did it to them first.
668676 672095 You think the Soviets would put<br />up with this shit? They'd invade.
672263 674848 We helped the guy torture and<br />de-ball an entire population.
675016 677225 - How many were there?<br />- At least 50. We're not sure.
677393 679436 - Schafer!<br />- You still haven't found Schafer?
679604 681480 No, I was screaming his name<br />because I was fucking him.
681981 684024 CANADIAN AMBASSADOR'S RESIDENCE, TEHRAN
684025 685025 Come in.
685193 686860 It's confirmed, sir. Six escaped.
687028 689196 - I was told five.<br />- No, sir, apparently it's six.
689363 692699 SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE - What<br />happened? - Not clear. We know they escaped.
692867 695035 - Where are they?<br />- The Canadian ambassador's house.
695203 698914 - Do they stay put? Are we attempting rescue?<br />- Hold for the Secretary of State.
699081 700874 Yes. Is White House joining?
701042 702626 They claim the embassy<br />was a den of espionage.
702793 704252 - We wish it was.<br />- A fuckin' den of espionage.
704420 705668 WHITE HOUSE, CHIEF OF<br />STAFF'S OFFICE
705669 706989 CI's got three people over there, they<br />don't see a revolution coming?
707057 710091 - Call it something other than intelligence.<br />- Hold for the chief of staff.
710259 711885 - Hodding.<br />- I'll call him back.
712053 714179 They're sticking. No release<br />till we expel the shah.
714347 717390 - Put him on a plane, then. Fuck him.<br />- He's half-dead and he's in chemo.
717558 718975 We took him in. He's ours now.
719143 721603 Great, so we'll take in any<br />prick as long as he's got cancer?
721771 723313 No, just the pricks on our side.
723481 727025 So all our other pricks on their prick thrones<br />know when they get thrown out on a rail...
727193 730362 ...they won't get their fucking spleens<br />taken out by some camel vet in Sinai.
730530 733031 What about the six who<br />are with the Canadians?
733449 736076 We've got 60 in the embassy with<br />guns to their heads right now.
736244 739037 The whole world is watching the embassy.<br />They're safer than the six on the street.
739205 741373 Banisadr's saying it'll<br />be over in 24 hours.
744961 747462 We leave the six where they<br />are. I'll go brief the president.
750758 751883 All right, let's get to it.
752051 755554 So far official comments about the<br />incident have been a model of restraint.
764355 768692 69 DAYS LATER
781372 784249 Iran's Revolutionary Guard has<br />rounded up a gang of terrorists...
784417 788920 ...blamed for one murder of a half-dozen<br />followers of Ayatollah Khomeini.
789088 792841 It says security at Khomeini's<br />home now has been tightened.
793009 797679 This, by the way, is the 69th day that the<br />American hostages have been held in Tehran.
797847 799889 There is no change reported<br />in the hostage situation.
801517 804853 In this country, George Meany died<br />last night. He was 85 years old.
806897 808315 Yeah.
809525 810984 Yes.
813446 814446 What?
814780 816615 To begin with, of course...
816782 820452 ...we wanted to learn about the hostages<br />held in the American embassy compound.
820620 823997 They may not understand what their<br />ordeal means to their countrymen.
824165 826458 But this nation, their<br />nation, is outraged.
827168 829523 C.I.A. HEADQUARTERS, VIRGINIA
829524 832088 And we cannot really know what it is like<br />inside the prison that was once our embassy.
832506 836718 Actions of Iran have<br />shocked the civilized world.
837219 839679 Our embassy has been seized...
839847 844851 ...and more than 60 American citizens<br />continue to be held as hostages.
845019 849022 The situation in Iran this morning is<br />unchanged in regard to the hostages.
849190 852400 NBC's situation in Iran<br />has changed, however.
856238 859157 - Is he back there?<br />- Office.
863537 865080 What happened?
865456 868041 The six of them went out a back exit.
868209 870710 Brits turned them away,<br />Kiwis turned them away.
870878 872587 Canadians took them in.
872755 874798 Traffic calls them "The Houseguests. "
874965 878093 They haven't left the Canadian<br />ambassador's house since it happened.
878260 880470 - Why didn't we get them 10 weeks ago?<br />- Too dangerous.
880638 884099 You got Revolutionary Guards going<br />door-to-door like Jehovah's Witnesses.
884266 887560 Half of them think that Khomeini's been<br />too lenient on the ones in the embassy.
887728 889187 What about the White House?
889355 891981 Carter's shitting enough<br />bricks to build the pyramids.
892149 893191 The Canadians are done.
893359 897028 They say they're bearing too much risk. Their<br />foreign secretary corners Vance in Brussels...
897196 899739 ...and told him she<br />wants the six of them out.
899907 902450 - Who else knows?<br />- Just the families.
902618 905328 Meanwhile, some genius in our<br />embassy was keeping a mug book...
905496 908373 - ... on everybody who worked there.<br />- Jesus Christ.
908541 910709 We think it got shredded<br />before they got in.
910876 914921 But now the bastards are using<br />sweatshop kids to reassemble the shreds.
915089 918800 And once they reassemble that book<br />they'll know six Americans got out.
918968 920552 And they'll know what they look like.
920720 923096 Standing room only for<br />beheadings in the square.
923264 926850 - Who's handling? - State<br />is coordinating in-house.
927685 929144 State?
929729 931604 - They don't do exfils.<br />- They do now.
931772 934232 They want to run it by us,<br />strictly as consultants.
934400 936443 Engell says it's a lose-lose.
936610 940321 These people die, they<br />die badly. Publicly.
940489 942490 State wants the blame,<br />we'll give it to them.
943451 945285 What does he want me here for?
945453 948246 So he can tell State he ran<br />it by his best exfil guy.
954920 956254 Okay.
956464 959174 This is Bob Pender from State O.S.
959341 961217 He's been talking to Morgan at ExtAff.
961385 963762 - Bob?<br />- Thank you.
964180 965597 All right.
965931 967640 Mark and Cora Lijek.
967808 971227 Twenty-nine and 25. He's a consular<br />officer, she's an assistant.
971562 974814 Newlyweds. They only just<br />got there a couple months ago.
975566 979110 No language skills or<br />in-country knowledge.
979278 982655 Henry Lee Schatz. Agricultural<br />attache from Idaho.
982823 984616 A bit of an oddball, apparently.
984784 987994 He was there to sell U.S.<br />tractors to Iranian agro.
988454 990747 Joe Stafford. Late 20s.
990915 992791 He's smart and a climber.
992958 994042 Speaks Farsi.
994210 997045 He arranged the hire of his wife, Kathy.
997213 1000507 Embassy was understaffed, so the<br />faculty wives were the typing pool.
1000674 1003218 And Bob Anders. Senior<br />consular officer...
1003385 1005970 ...oldest of the group and<br />most likely to be group leader.
1006138 1009015 They're in hiding at the<br />Canadian ambassador's residence.
1009183 1012977 Fortunately, we do not believe the<br />Iranians are aware the six have escaped.
1013145 1017232 So, what we like for this are bicycles.
1018025 1021027 We've identified back roads<br />from the Shemiran district.
1021195 1023530 A couple of rat lines<br />through the mountains...
1023697 1024989 ...to the crossing near Tabriz.
1025157 1028034 Cars are off the table<br />because of the roadblocks.
1028202 1029744 We wait till the weather clears up...
1029912 1033289 ...then deliver the six bikes, provide<br />them with maps to the Turkish border.
1033457 1036084 We have intelligence<br />they can ride bicycles.
1036252 1039212 Or we're prepared to send<br />in somebody to teach them.
1046720 1050223 Or you could just send in training wheels<br />and meet them at the border with Gatorade.
1050391 1051850 Tony.
1052017 1054018 It's 300 miles to the Turkish border.
1054186 1056604 They'd need a support team<br />following them with a tire pump.
1056772 1059148 We were just asked to sharpshoot this.
1059316 1060692 State is handling the op.
1060860 1062110 I'm sorry, who is this?
1062528 1066698 Tony's an exfil spesh. He got a lot of<br />the shah's people out after the fall.
1066866 1069450 Sir, if these people can read or add...
1069618 1072662 ...pretty soon they're gonna figure<br />out they're six short of a full deck.
1072830 1073630 It's winter.
1073631 1076833 You can't afford to wait around till spring<br />so it's nice enough to take a bike ride.
1077001 1080587 The only way out of that city is the airport.<br />Build new cover identities for them...
1080754 1083715 ...you send in a Moses, he takes<br />them out on a commercial flight.
1083883 1086718 - We've explored those options.<br />- They'll never get past airport control.
1086886 1089429 - Komiteh own the place.<br />- They could pose as reporters.
1089597 1091639 - The government issued<br />70-something... - Seventy-four.
1091807 1093391 ...visas for American journalists.
1093559 1095560 The Revolutionary Guards<br />keep them on 74 leashes.
1095728 1097646 If they're caught with<br />fake journalist creds,
1097647 1099606 it's Peter Jennings' head<br />in a noose in an hour.
1099773 1101900 North American accents<br />gives us limited options.
1102067 1104068 So we get the Canadians<br />to issue them passports.
1104236 1106654 What about English teachers<br />at the international school?
1106822 1109490 It's a good idea, but that school's<br />been closed for eight months.
1109658 1111284 Okay, so how about the do-gooders?
1112745 1116581 Six Canadians have been over there inspecting<br />crops, making sure the kids get enough to eat.
1116749 1119292 We give them creds, makes<br />them look like Ag NGOs.
1119877 1122587 It's a Feed the Kids thing. Okay?
1122755 1124422 Those kids are black.
1124757 1126299 Those are African kids.
1126467 1129677 - We get ethnically appropriate kids.<br />- Are there starving kids in Iran?
1129845 1132513 I'm sure there's some<br />skinny kids in Iran, so...
1132681 1135516 - What about missionaries?<br />- A logo with seeds. Call it "Seeds of Hope. "
1135684 1136726 Hold on.
1136894 1140438 Sir, do you have this newspaper in front<br />of you? Would you mind taking a look at it?
1142399 1143691 What's in this picture?
1143859 1146110 - Tehran.<br />- Right. What's on the ground?
1148530 1149948 - Snow.<br />- Right.
1150240 1153368 So, what crops are the do-gooders<br />inspecting under Frosty?
1155788 1159123 Sir, exfils are like abortions.
1159291 1160959 You don't wanna need one...
1161126 1163962 ...but when you do, you<br />don't do it yourself.
1168968 1170551 You have a better plan?
1171553 1172971 No, sir.
1176350 1179102 Whatever the conflicting<br />signals from Iran today...
1179269 1180687 ...and for that matter, every day...
1180854 1183898 ...about whether the hostages will<br />or will not be tried as spies...
1184066 1187777 ...the government of the United States<br />has not deviated from its basic demand:
1187945 1190071 The hostages must be freed.
1190239 1193074 ...claims to defend human rights,<br />it not only does not defend them...
1193242 1195994 ...it violates them for all nations.
1196161 1197996 We demand extradition...
1198163 1201442 U.S. EMBASSY, TEHRAN... of a man who,<br />for more than 37 years, with the...
1201510 1206295 United States' support has killed months-old<br />babies in the arms of their mothers.
1206463 1210174 He said if the Americans try military<br />force to rescue the hostages...
1210342 1214053 ...the students will kill them<br />all and blow up the embassy.
1214763 1218182 Americans were outraged<br />at Iran and anyone Iranian.
1218350 1221185 Before that decision was taken,<br />there was a demonstration in Houston.
1221353 1223104 An Iranian flag was burned...
1223272 1227108 ...when anti-Iranian demonstrators<br />gathered near the Iranian consulate.
1227276 1230528 ...also is what led to a decision to<br />scrutinize the visas of Iranians...
1230696 1233573 They knew exactly what was<br />going to happen. They knew.
1233741 1236242 But I don't understand<br />what they should do now.
1236410 1238995 Send him back, just to<br />be tortured and killed?
1239163 1241539 I don't think that<br />justice is the worst thing.
1241707 1244500 When did people first tell you<br />that torture was going on in Iran?
1244668 1248588 They would never come to me and say,<br />"Well, sir, we have tortured this fellow. "
1248756 1252508 President Sadat of Egypt,<br />he calls you, Imam...
1252676 1255011 Forgive me, his words, not mine.
1255179 1256345 ...a lunatic.
1256513 1259515 Why didn't he have a choice? Why do<br />you think he didn't have a choice?
1259683 1261017 He would've been referred<br />to as a barbarian.
1261185 1263895 That's why they're saying<br />that their current regime...
1264063 1265521 The shah did more for women's rights...
1265689 1268816 I think you'd better... Please,<br />everyone, get into the crawlspace.
1286210 1289212 At one point, the mob<br />cornered one of the Iranians.
1289379 1292799 When he tried to protect<br />himself, this is what happened.
1293383 1294759 Just hit him again!
1294927 1298429 We're not gonna take it<br />anymore! We're sick of it!
1299515 1300848 America!
1301016 1306646 Even in our little community here, I mean,<br />people are drawn up tight, they're tense.
1306980 1310858 They shouldn't even let those<br />students in that embassy there.
1311026 1314237 Just shoot a couple of them,<br />show them we mean business.
1314571 1317573 Men who served in Vietnam for what<br />they believed was right are angry.
1317741 1318825 I'm mad as hell.
1318992 1323746 I'm like the guy screaming on that movie<br />program in Network, you know? I've had it.
1323914 1327500 And if need be, I'll bear arms again.
1327668 1331295 And that's the way it is<br />Wednesday, January 16th, 1980.
1331463 1335716 The 74th day of captivity<br />for 50 Americans in Iran.
1344268 1346227 - Hello?<br />- Buddy man.
1346395 1347854 I'll get Mom.
1348021 1349522 I'm looking for you.
1351400 1352984 Did you do your homework tonight?
1353152 1355903 - Yeah, it was easy.<br />- Excellent. What are we watching?
1356071 1358156 Battle for the Planet of the Apes.
1358323 1359657 Tell me, what channel is it on?
1359908 1361075 Five.
1365122 1366164 All right.
1368250 1371335 - What'd you do at school today?<br />- Nothing. I don't know. Nothing.
1373213 1375756 Can't be nothing.<br />Something must've happened.
1375924 1377758 After school I got some baseball cards.
1377926 1379343 - Mm-hm. -<br />That was fun.
1397029 1398821 Okay, you know those<br />science-fiction movies?
1398989 1401616 Star Trek, Star Wars. They need<br />an exotic location to shoot.
1401783 1404243 Moonscape, Mars, desert, you know.
1404411 1405703 Now, imagine this:
1406955 1411125 They're a Canadian film crew on a<br />location scout for a science-fiction movie.
1411543 1412793 We put it out there...
1412961 1414754 The Canadian producers put it out there.
1414922 1416547 ...that we're looking<br />at Egypt, Istanbul.
1417883 1422220 Then we go to the consulate and say,<br />"Hey, we wanna look at Iran too. "
1422387 1426933 I fly into Tehran, we all fly<br />out together as a film crew. Done.
1427267 1430311 Flamboyant cover identities should be avoided,<br />as it increases operational visibility.
1430479 1433522 This is more plausible than foreigners<br />who wanna go be teachers in Iran.
1433690 1436192 You wanna blend in with the population,<br />you don't look like a rodeo clown.
1436360 1439070 Just gonna wake up tomorrow morning<br />and be in the movie business?
1439238 1441072 We already have credentials<br />for the teachers.
1441240 1443032 - No, sir, we have a contact in L.A.<br />- Chambers.
1443200 1445326 John Chambers. He's a<br />Hollywood prosthetics guy.
1445494 1447181 He's got an Oscar,<br />he did 'Planet of the Apes'.
1447182 1449455 Did a bunch of contract<br />work for us in the past.
1449623 1453651 I go see him, he sets us up.<br />One, two days, make it look real.
1468517 1472436 I went outside for 30 seconds. Could you give<br />me a break? I can't breathe in this house.
1472604 1475606 - I need some fresh air. I can't breathe.<br />- Stay inside the fucking house.
1475774 1478609 - Who saw me go outside? I'm just curious.<br />- That's not the point, Bob.
1478777 1481028 - It doesn't matter who saw you go out.<br />- Did you see me?
1481196 1483531 - No.<br />- I did, okay? I saw you.
1483699 1486701 Bob, it only takes one<br />second for them to spot you.
1491999 1493708 Some Americans are missing.
1493875 1496043 Look at the repaired<br />list of embassy employees.
1497546 1499130 The numbers don't match.
1499298 1502216 Finish assembling the<br />pictures from the embassy.
1502384 1504927 All I need is their faces<br />and I will find them.
1505095 1506846 Yes, sir, it will be done.
1519109 1520568 We want you to go to L.A.
1520736 1524196 If you can make the movie thing<br />credible, we'll take you to the director.
1525032 1526073 Don't fuck up.
1526658 1528701 The whole country is watching you.
1529244 1530953 They just don't know it.
1538295 1539378 My creation.
1540881 1542548 My creation.
1548805 1549889 What the fuck, Brian?
1550057 1551265 - Cut.<br />- We're cutting.
1551433 1553642 - What an idiot.<br />- It really hurt.
1553810 1555019 I'm sorry.
1555187 1558147 Chambers. John Chambers, makeup!
1559441 1564111 BURBANK, CALIFORNIA<br />- JANUARY 19, 1980
1569951 1573871 He says the Minotaur prosthetic<br />is too tight, so he can't act.
1574164 1576791 If he could act, he wouldn't<br />be playing the Minotaur.
1582964 1584382 Mr. Chambers?
1585092 1586467 Kevin Harkins.
1588303 1589762 Hey, Tony.
1613954 1615079 Watch your head.
1615622 1617164 What are you shooting?
1617499 1619208 Monster movie.
1620210 1621377 Yeah? Any good?
1623088 1624839 Target audience will hate it.
1625006 1626507 Who's the target audience?
1626716 1628259 People with eyes.
1630929 1632179 Talk to me.
1634141 1635516 It's an exfil.
1635684 1636851 From where?
1638019 1639437 Worst place you can think of.
1639604 1640980 Universal City.
1647779 1649530 How are you gonna get into the embassy?
1649739 1653033 They're not in the embassy. During<br />the takeover, six people escaped.
1653243 1655035 They're hiding out in Tehran.
1655454 1658497 - And that's who I'm gonna go get.<br />- What am I making?
1659499 1661375 I need you to help me make a fake movie.
1661543 1664044 Heh. You came to the right place.
1664212 1667381 I wanna set up a production company<br />and build a cover around making a movie.
1667549 1669550 - That we're not gonna make.<br />- No.
1670135 1672470 So you wanna come to Hollywood<br />and act like a big shot?
1672637 1674597 - Without actually doing anything?<br />- No.
1674764 1676348 You'll fit right in.
1682522 1683731 Let's see.
1684357 1687776 Well, this one's got an M.A. in<br />English. She should be your screenwriter.
1687944 1690863 Sometimes they go along on scouts<br />because they want the free meals.
1691031 1692740 Here's your director.
1692908 1695075 Can you teach somebody<br />to be a director in a day?
1695285 1697578 You can teach a rhesus monkey<br />to be a director in a day.
1698371 1701582 Look, if you're gonna<br />do this, you gotta do it.
1701750 1704043 The Kho-maniacs are Froot<br />Loops, but they got cousins...
1704211 1706420 ...who sell prayer rugs<br />and eight-tracks on La Brea.
1707255 1710549 You can't build cover stories<br />around a movie that doesn't exist.
1710717 1712885 You need a script. You need a producer.
1713053 1714220 - Make me a producer.<br />- No.
1714387 1717723 You're an associate producer at best.
1718391 1721435 If you're gonna do a $20<br />million Star Wars rip-off...
1721603 1725439 ...you need somebody who's a<br />somebody to put their name on it.
1725607 1727525 Somebody respectable.
1728735 1729944 With credits.
1730946 1733614 Who you can trust with<br />classified information.
1734616 1736825 Who'll produce a fake movie.
1737452 1738869 For free.
1752801 1755970 Hi. I only got a couple of minutes. I'm<br />getting a lifetime achievement award.
1756137 1757721 - Mazel tov, Lester.<br />- Ah.
1757889 1760391 I'd rather stay home and count<br />the wrinkles on my dog's balls.
1761393 1765646 Okay, you got six people hiding out<br />in a town of, what, 4 million people...
1765814 1769483 ...all of whom chant "Death to<br />America" all the livelong day.
1769651 1771235 You want to set up a movie in a week.
1771403 1774822 You want to lie to Hollywood, a town<br />where everybody lies for a living.
1774990 1777491 Then you're gonna sneak 007 over here...
1777659 1781161 ...into a country that wants CIA<br />blood on their breakfast cereal...
1781329 1784832 ...and you're gonna walk the Brady Bunch<br />out of the most watched city in the world.
1785000 1787751 Past about a hundred militia<br />at the airport. That's right.
1789296 1790671 Right.
1792424 1794174 Look, I gotta tell you.
1794342 1798304 We did suicide missions in the<br />Army that had better odds than this.
1798471 1799930 Sir, the car is here.
1807564 1810608 You ever think, Lester, how<br />this is all for the cameras?
1810775 1813819 Well, they're getting the<br />ratings, I'll say that for...
1825707 1827625 We're gonna need a script.
1836635 1838719 Here, come on, come on, come on.
1838887 1840054 - No, it's fine.<br />- Stop.
1845977 1847394 Okay.
1857572 1858656 I love you.
1868458 1870584 PAT: Sahar, how are you doing?
1871586 1873045 SAHAR: Fine, thank you.
1874339 1876507 Your friends from Canada, ma'am.
1876675 1880344 All this time. They never go out.
1893608 1895442 PAT: Sahar knows.
1899072 1901240 How about The Horses of Achilles?
1901408 1903867 No good. Nobody does Westerns anymore.
1904035 1908205 - It's ancient Troy.<br />- If it's got horses in it, it's a Western.
1908373 1909415 Hey, Kenny, please.
1909958 1911959 Yeah, it's John Chambers,<br />about the office space.
1912127 1914586 It doesn't matter. It's a fake movie.
1914754 1918257 If I'm doing a fake movie,<br />it's gonna be a fake hit.
1918425 1922052 The cardinal wants all cover<br />options on his desk Friday morning.
1922220 1925472 Engell's prepping the bikes<br />option, the teachers option.
1925640 1928934 You have 72 hours to make yours better.
1929436 1930644 Fine.
1955420 1959256 Hey, is A 006 still on the open list?
1959883 1960924 Yeah, I'll hold.
1961426 1965429 "Fade in on a starship landing.<br />An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe.
1965597 1969349 Women gather, offering ecstatic<br />libations to the sky gods.
1969934 1972978 Argo. A science-fantasy adventure. "
1973146 1976356 - It's in turnaround. It's dog shit.<br />- It's a space movie in the Middle East.
1976524 1978150 - Does it matter?<br />- Can we get the option?
1979277 1980819 Why do we need the option?
1980987 1984865 You're worried about the<br />Ayatollah? Try the WGA.
1986701 1988118 Just let me do the talking.
1988286 1991538 I've known this guy for 25 years. He's<br />full of shit and he comes on hard...
1991706 1993373 ...but I can handle him.
1995960 1997836 You want to go into production<br />with this in one month?
1998004 1999630 Up like a carny ride.
1999798 2000839 One month, yeah.
2001007 2003383 - Who are you again?<br />- Kevin Harkins. Studio Six Films.
2003551 2004927 He's the money.
2005094 2010182 Look, what do you say 15<br />thou and let's close on this?
2012227 2013894 You want me to be honest with you, Les?
2014062 2016522 No. I would like you<br />to bullshit me, Max.
2016689 2018190 All right.
2018608 2021068 I enjoyed your films. The early ones.
2021236 2025364 I took this meeting out of respect,<br />because I wanted to say no to your face.
2026616 2028408 Thank you. Very respectful.
2028743 2030077 You're finished, Lester.
2030620 2032496 Get your cataracts<br />fixed, read the trades.
2033706 2036250 MGM just capitalized for six new films.
2036417 2038877 They're screaming for sci-fi.
2039128 2042256 They're offering me four times<br />what you guys are offering me.
2043758 2047219 Well, what can I say?
2047428 2049012 Congratulations.
2049514 2053725 But, see, it kind of worries me, what<br />you said, and let me tell you why.
2054894 2058647 Couple of weeks ago, I was sitting at<br />Trader Vic's, I was enjoying a Mai Tai...
2058815 2060524 ...when my pal Warren Beatty comes in.
2060692 2062776 He wishes me well, we had a little chat.
2063278 2066238 Seems he was attached<br />to star in Zulu Empire...
2066406 2068615 ...which was gonna<br />anchor that MGM slate.
2068783 2071869 But Warren confided in me that<br />the picture's gone over budget...
2072036 2074955 ...because the Zulu<br />extras wanna unionize.
2075123 2077708 They may be cannibals, but<br />they want health and dental...
2077876 2079167 ...so the movie's kaput.
2079335 2082546 Which means that the MGM<br />deal ain't gonna happen...
2082714 2085549 ...and your script ain't worth<br />the buffalo shit on a nickel.
2086217 2087968 So the way it looks to me...
2088177 2089970 Through the cataracts, I grant you.
2090179 2091930 ...is that you can either sign here...
2092098 2095100 ...and take $10,000 for<br />your toilet paper script...
2095268 2097477 ...or you can go fuck yourself.
2098313 2100397 With all due respect.
2106696 2108238 You really know Warren Beatty?
2108406 2112159 Yes, I do. I took a leak next<br />to him once at the Golden Globes.
2112827 2114119 Taco?
2132472 2133639 Got any kids, Lester?
2134974 2136850 Yeah. I have two daughters.
2138269 2139519 You see them much?
2140146 2141605 I talk to them once a year.
2142690 2144733 - Maybe.<br />- Why is that?
2148237 2150238 I was a terrible father.
2152033 2155327 The bullshit business,<br />it's like coal mining.
2155495 2158789 You come home to your wife and<br />kids, you can't wash it off.
2160959 2162042 You?
2163378 2164878 Yeah, I got a son.
2166130 2168256 He lives in Virginia with his mother.
2171970 2173845 You're divorced?
2174055 2175847 Taking time off.
2177976 2180060 He needs to be, you know...
2180228 2181269 ...where he is.
2183731 2185732 Kids need the mother.
2194367 2197119 They caught the shah's chief of security<br />trying to get on a plane to Paris.
2200081 2201248 Listen.
2201416 2204793 Since the incident, the number of<br />guards at the airport has doubled.
2204961 2207879 Thorough background<br />examinations should be expected.
2208047 2211258 The movie cover isn't strong enough<br />yet. I need another week, Jack.
2211718 2213552 You don't have it.
2215555 2216596 We got an office.
2217598 2219683 We got business cards.
2219851 2221685 We got a poster.
2222603 2225897 If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, that's<br />nothing we couldn't have made at home.
2226107 2228025 Six people's lives depend on this.
2229444 2233447 It's not enough. If we're gonna<br />fool these people, it has to be big.
2233614 2236616 And it has to have something<br />that says it's authentic.
2237577 2240787 I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.
2241748 2244082 If you wanna sell a lie...
2245126 2247627 You get the press to sell it for you.
2248588 2252340 No, no, no. Press event and then<br />they're gonna read through the script.
2252508 2256470 Well, they got a bunch of actors,<br />they're gonna read from beginning to end.
2256637 2258472 They have costumes and everything.
2258639 2262392 No, no, no, I can't. Variety<br />has an exclusive on that.
2262560 2265729 Is there any way to make<br />this more Middle Eastern?
2266397 2267981 Mesopotamia? Egypt?
2268149 2269232 Iran.
2269400 2272986 Look, I can get you in, but you're gonna<br />have to promise me at least half a page.
2273154 2276281 No, no, this thing's an event.<br />It's gonna be a spectacle.
2338219 2341972 - Lester?<br />- Nina. You look fabulous.
2342140 2343223 You're doing the reading?
2343432 2345559 I'm playing Serksi, the Galactic Witch.
2345726 2347686 Great. I'll call you.
2349147 2351731 Keep that fucking space<br />witch away from me.
2351941 2354234 - You know her?<br />- I was married to her.
2354443 2356069 Oh, my God, Iraq is amazing.
2356237 2357362 Oh, we're shooting in Iran.
2357530 2358947 Iran with an N?
2359115 2360699 Yeah. We're very excited.
2360867 2362159 You ever watch the news?
2362326 2364077 What does the title refer to?
2364829 2367414 The Argo. You know, it's the thing.
2367582 2369332 Like Jason and the<br />Golden Fleece, or what?
2369500 2371418 No, no. It's the ship.<br />It's the spaceship.
2371586 2376423 It goes everywhere. It<br />goes all throughout space.
2377049 2378216 So it's the Argonaut.
2378843 2379885 No.
2380052 2382179 - What does "Argo" mean?<br />- I don't know.
2382346 2383430 You don't know?
2383598 2386057 It means "Argo fuck yourself. "
2388186 2390896 Excuse me. May I have your<br />attention, ladies and gentlemen?
2391063 2395609 If our artists could settle in. We're<br />just about ready to begin the reading.
2395776 2399529 Argo, by Mary Ann Boyd.
2399697 2401907 "Fade in on starship landing.
2402074 2403617 Exterior, bazaar.
2403784 2406620 An exotic, Middle Eastern vibe. "
2414295 2417464 The people working<br />here are not diplomats.
2417632 2420091 In fact, as Imam Khomeini said...
2420259 2424137 ...we have found no evidence that<br />proves that these people are diplomats.
2424305 2428808 All evidence proves that<br />these people are spies.
2428976 2432646 In the name of God, the<br />beneficent, the merciful...
2432813 2435440 ...our message to the<br />awakened peoples of the world:
2435608 2438318 At this time we want to<br />expose the hateful acts...
2438486 2440654 Our world has changed.
2441113 2444074 The fire of hope stopped<br />burning in this galaxy long ago.
2444575 2446326 The ship is turning around.
2446535 2447994 Fire the thrusters!
2448162 2450580 He says a gravitational field<br />that strong will kill anyone.
2450748 2453124 ...were completely unjustified.
2453292 2454960 They and all others must know...
2455795 2458672 ...that the United States<br />of America will not yield...
2458839 2461549 ...to international<br />terrorism or to blackmail.
2461717 2465428 Sir! We'll be crushed!<br />There's not enough time!
2465596 2468682 ...are controlled by capitalists<br />and large oil companies.
2468849 2472352 The United States government considers<br />revolutionaries as terrorists...
2472520 2477357 ...but itself and its CIA are the most<br />terrorizing organization of all time.
2477566 2480318 "The story was told, but<br />there are infinitely more.
2480486 2483363 Three setting suns. The princess's<br />robes fall from her body. "
2483531 2486366 If we find his ship we<br />will find our chance.
2487368 2491162 Aboard the Argo lies my<br />hope, my hero, my husband.
2491330 2494708 We will begin the trials<br />and carry out the sentences.
2494875 2498908 You wonder where and how this seemingly<br />endless parade of hatred will end.
2498942 2499606 EMBASSY BASEMENT - JANUARY 23, 1980
2499607 2503508 What do they want? They say the<br />question should be not "what?" but "who?"
2503676 2506344 The answer to that is clear.<br />They want their former shah.
2506512 2509723 ...Carter and his administration<br />shameful to talk about human rights.
2509890 2514144 Carter and his government have given<br />asylum to the worst criminal of all.
2514312 2515353 For life?
2515521 2518898 They will remain until<br />the shah is returned.
2519191 2522694 But if the exiled shah, now<br />in a New York City hospital...
2522862 2526031 ...leaves the United States<br />for any place other than Iran...
2526198 2528408 ...harsher decisions will be<br />taken against the hostages.
2534707 2537334 "We cut outside to the Shidoori Dome...
2537501 2539336 ...holding on a single red flower...
2539503 2542922 ...as it grows from the ruins<br />of a starship in the desert.
2543090 2546718 Fade to black. " The end.
2552058 2554726 There is it. What'd I tell you?
2555102 2556853 First shot of the picture.
2561150 2562442 Argo fuck yourself.
2563027 2565028 Argo fuck yourself.
2587802 2590428 OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY<br />OF STATE JANUARY 25, 1980
2601982 2606569 Brace yourself. It's like talking to<br />those two old fucks on The Muppets.
2610116 2611324 Aliens and robots?
2612701 2614244 Yes, sir.
2614787 2618123 You're telling me that there is a<br />movie company in Hollywood right now...
2618290 2620083 ...that is funded by the CIA?
2620709 2621876 Yes, sir.
2623212 2626798 - What's wrong with the bikes again?<br />- We tried to get the message upstairs, sir.
2626966 2629592 You think this is more<br />plausible than teachers?
2629760 2633138 Yes, we do. One, there are no<br />more foreign teachers in Iran.
2633305 2635515 And we think everybody<br />knows Hollywood people.
2635724 2637752 Everybody knows they'd<br />shoot in Stalingrad...
2637753 2640228 ...with Pol Pot directing<br />if it would sell tickets
2640438 2642689 There are only bad options.
2642857 2644357 It's about finding the best one.
2645359 2647360 You don't have a better<br />bad idea than this?
2647528 2650280 This is the best bad idea we have, sir.
2650448 2651489 By far.
2659790 2663793 The United States government has just<br />sanctioned your science-fiction movie.
2664920 2665962 Thank you, sir.
2702416 2707337 I'm required to remind you that if you are<br />detained, the agency will not claim you.
2709006 2710173 Barely claim me as it is.
2712384 2714093 Your "in case of's" good?
2715179 2716679 It's just Christine.
2719558 2721559 I should've brought some<br />books to read in prison.
2721727 2722769 No.
2723437 2725438 They'll kill you long before prison.
2727441 2728608 - Thanks for the ride.<br />- Yeah.
2738911 2739953 Studio Six.
2740120 2743373 We got a green light. Keep the office<br />running until you hear otherwise.
2743874 2746834 Argo fuck yourself.
2765521 2767313 Your attention, please.
2767481 2770984 This is the final boarding call<br />for British Airways Flight 87.
2803350 2805018 "We are a nation of 35 million.
2806395 2810189 And many of these people are<br />looking forward to martyrdom. "
2813360 2815695 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
2816405 2817780 Come to bed.
2818782 2819949 In five minutes.
2831795 2834172 You know, she pleaded with me.
2834840 2838176 When it started in the<br />streets nine months ago...
2839219 2841721 ...she begged for us to leave.
2842806 2845725 She packed our bags, and I said:
2845893 2849062 "You know what? You know,<br />just a little bit longer. "
2851398 2853483 And all I was thinking was:
2855653 2857195 "Stay.
2858197 2859989 This is good for me.
2861116 2862575 Stay.
2865621 2867246 Show Newsom you got the balls. "
2873087 2875922 I can't believe I put<br />Kathy in this position.
2884473 2886849 I think we're gonna die here.
2913836 2917922 ISTANBUL, TURKEY<br />- JANUARY 27, 1980
2936358 2940778 "Iran is 100 percent not in<br />a prerevolutionary state. "
2940946 2943990 CIA brief, November 1st, 1979.
2944158 2946159 Can't be right all the time.
2946660 2947827 Kevin.
2948328 2949537 When'd you get back?
2950748 2952957 The shah escaped in a 747...
2953167 2956502 ...so laden with gold bars, it<br />nearly didn't make it off the runway.
2956670 2957712 But you kept busy.
2957880 2962925 Ferrying out the torture apparatus<br />of our friend's fallen dictatorship.
2963385 2964886 It's getting worse.
2965053 2968014 Everyone who lands at Mehrabad<br />now fills in one of these.
2969183 2973060 That slip makes a copy to the one underneath.<br />Passenger keeps yellow, airport keeps white.
2973228 2974771 When you leave, they match them up...
2974938 2977315 ...to verify you came into the<br />country when you say you did.
2977483 2981444 So if they look, they'll see I didn't<br />come into the country with six people.
2982196 2983946 If they look.
2985991 2990995 When you land, you should go straight to the<br />Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance...
2991205 2992622 ...to kiss the ring.
2992790 2996000 Get on record as having<br />applied for a film permit.
2996335 2999921 If they catch you later, at least they'll<br />be confused while they're torturing you.
3003884 3007845 IRANIAN CONSULATE<br />- TURKEY
3017648 3019774 What will be the purpose<br />of your visit to Iran?
3020150 3023277 Uh, film production. Business.
3025656 3028449 Why didn't you get your visa in Canada?
3029827 3033663 I would've loved to, except my boss<br />didn't send a telex till I got here.
3034331 3037917 Guy had an intelligent thought in<br />his head, it would die of loneliness.
3058897 3061607 The Times and AP found out six escaped.
3061775 3065111 They know who they are and they know<br />they're hiding out with the Canadians.
3065279 3067071 Somebody with one of<br />the families talked.
3067281 3068614 Mother of God.
3068782 3071576 Yeah, I just put Vance on a plane<br />to take the editors to Le Cirque.
3071743 3074203 He thinks he can get them<br />to sit on it, for now.
3075205 3077164 Your guy better get them...
3077833 3079709 ...and get the hell out.
3080502 3083462 The captain has informed us that<br />we have entered Iranian airspace.
3083630 3088134 We'll be coming through to collect<br />any remaining alcoholic beverages.
3246334 3248002 This film crew is just yourself?
3248545 3251505 No, we have six more from<br />Canada meeting us today.
3251673 3253507 You like to film at the bazaar?
3254009 3255843 The bazaar, maybe the palace.
3256678 3258304 Landmark sites.
3258513 3260097 I see.
3260891 3262767 The exotic Orient.
3263185 3266562 Snake charmers, flying carpets.
3267481 3270357 You came to us at a complicated time.
3270525 3274528 Before the revolution, 40 percent of the movie<br />theaters in Tehran were showing pornography.
3275697 3276947 I understand.
3277115 3280284 The function of this<br />office is purification...
3280494 3283746 ...as well as promotion for the arts.
3285040 3287625 I'll review this for the minister.
3288376 3289794 Okay. Thank you.
3298220 3301013 Lester, you're working late.
3301181 3303099 Till the dawn's early light.
3303266 3307144 You got stamina, Lester. I wanna be you.
3307354 3310189 Well, I'm 150 years old, so<br />you wouldn't be me for long.
3320117 3322284 - Mr. Ambassador.<br />- Ken Taylor.
3322452 3323953 Thank you for what you're doing.
3324746 3327581 I was expecting more of a G-man look.
3328667 3330668 I think you're thinking of the FBI, sir.
3331461 3333796 Ah. This way.
3345934 3349645 - These are blank, you know. Stamps...<br />- Yeah, I'll take care of this.
3351857 3352982 How long?
3353191 3355985 A day, prep their covers.<br />Two if they need it.
3356153 3357486 And you'll fly out with them?
3357904 3359530 Yeah.
3359698 3361365 There's something you should know.
3361575 3364827 We think our housekeeper<br />has figured out who they are.
3365370 3369832 We don't know if we can trust<br />her, so sooner is better.
3419716 3421008 Hi.
3421176 3423052 My name's Kevin Harkins...
3424137 3425721 ...and I'm gonna get you home.
3427182 3429808 These are the screenplays<br />for your cover identities.
3431436 3433896 It's theater of the absurd.
3434064 3436649 - What are our chances?<br />- Your chances are good.
3436816 3439944 "Good"? Well, what's the<br />number value of "good"?
3440153 3442863 Thirty percent chance of<br />being publicly executed?
3443031 3446575 Can you tell me what the objection<br />was to normal cover identities?
3446743 3448953 There are no Canadians in the<br />country for normal reasons.
3449120 3450663 - They'll sniff us out regardless.<br />- The Swedish Consul?
3450830 3454500 They accused him of being an American at<br />the airport. They held him for an hour.
3454668 3457711 We can't hold up under that. We don't<br />know what the hell movie people do.
3457879 3459004 That's why I'm here.
3459172 3462675 I'm gonna help you. I'll be with<br />you the whole way. This is what I do.
3462842 3464885 Have you gotten people<br />out this way before?
3466221 3467721 This would be a first.
3469224 3472810 Do you know that every day they catch<br />another friend of the shah at the airport?
3472978 3475479 Kangaroo trials and<br />then firing squads...
3475689 3478399 ...just for having American<br />names in their phone books.
3478566 3480025 You've been here an hour.
3480193 3482611 And you're asking us to trust<br />you with our lives, Mr...?
3482779 3484113 Harkins.
3484322 3486115 That's your real name?
3486783 3487950 No.
3490912 3494707 I know there are risks<br />involved. Serious risks.
3495208 3496917 But it is time to go.
3499379 3503007 We've got orders to close the embassy and<br />go back. There's nowhere for them to stay.
3505510 3509221 We will never make it through<br />immigration at the airport. I'm serious.
3509389 3513309 No, no, no, this is what, the part when we<br />say this is so crazy it might actually work?
3513476 3515311 Joe, I saw it in Burma.<br />They get people out.
3515478 3518731 Snitches in banana republics? They get<br />them over the border after the coup.
3518898 3519940 That's your opinion, Joe.
3520108 3522276 You know, his opinion got<br />us out in the first place.
3522777 3526905 If we go out there with fake passports,<br />we are spies, period. That's execution.
3527073 3529616 - You got a problem lying, Joe?<br />- Point is, we can't stay here.
3530285 3533912 If we get caught, you and Pat go on trial<br />for harboring the enemy, you know that?
3534080 3536665 Pat and I have discussed<br />it. It's the risk we took.
3537459 3540377 That man out there has got bad<br />cards and he is going to lose.
3540545 3543839 And if he loses, it's our lives.
3545133 3547134 And his life too.
3548553 3550471 Look, we don't have any alternatives.
3550638 3551847 We gotta go.
3558355 3561815 These cover identities were created<br />specifically for each one of you.
3561983 3564526 What you need to do is memorize<br />everything that's inside.
3564694 3567613 Who you are, what you are,<br />where you've been. Complete bio.
3567781 3568864 And then add to that.
3569032 3572451 Where do you vacation? What are your<br />allergies? Who'd you have an affair with?
3572619 3573786 The only way this works...
3573953 3577623 ...is if you believe that you're these<br />people so much that you dream like them.
3578583 3580292 Get started tonight.
3581002 3584004 I'll be back tomorrow.<br />We'll get going. Good luck.
3589594 3591303 Well, my guy kind of sucks.
3591471 3592846 What's your name?
3593556 3595849 Mike McEwan, eh? Heh.
3596810 3597851 That was convincing.
3598019 3599686 Kathy, what's your name?
3627674 3630884 The Love Boat will be<br />seen 15 minutes from now.
3631052 3634847 The State Department insisted today<br />that the crisis in Afghanistan...
3635014 3639101 ...will not divert the attention of the<br />United States from the plight of the hostages.
3639269 3641979 ...is perceived to be if not<br />impotent, then at least reluctant...
3642147 3646650 Now the United States finds itself in such<br />bitter confrontation with the Soviet Union...
3646818 3649653 ...over that country's<br />invasion of Afghanistan...
3649863 3652281 The United States is now<br />moving toward a decision...
3652449 3654491 ...to boycott the Summer<br />Olympics in Moscow...
3655660 3658871 Bad news, bad news. Even when<br />it's good news, it's bad news.
3659247 3663375 John Wayne's in the ground six<br />months, this is what's left of America.
3691905 3695532 "The Minister of Culture and Guidance<br />has approved your location scout.
3695700 3697618 He will send his representative<br />to meet you and your crew...
3697785 3701371 ...at the Khayyam entrance to the<br />Grand Bazaar tomorrow at 3 p. m. "
3702248 3703415 They called your bluff.
3703583 3706168 - Maybe they're cooperating.<br />- Absolutely not.
3706586 3710964 Seven Americans walking the bazaar<br />is asking for a riot. It's the hive.
3711132 3712466 Seven Canadians, Jack.
3712634 3715761 Never give them multiple<br />shots at a cover.
3716471 3717763 Are they even ready?
3717931 3719181 They're getting there.
3719349 3720891 There's no prize for "Most Improved. "
3721059 3723769 I don't have a choice. We say no,<br />they show up at the residence...
3723937 3726563 ...and drag everyone out. You think<br />their covers are gonna hold up...
3726731 3728565 ...when they're getting<br />their fingernails pulled out?
3749337 3752589 You want us to go to the Grand<br />Bazaar at 3:00 in the afternoon?
3753675 3756677 You said a day to learn our covers,<br />then straight to the airport.
3756844 3758470 They suspect something?
3758638 3761390 What I know is, we need to<br />pretend to be a movie crew.
3761558 3764977 We go to the bazaar today, we<br />fly out from the airport tomorrow.
3767063 3768480 We won't do it.
3770275 3772985 He told them that there were six<br />of us. So they're expecting six.
3773152 3775362 It would be suspicious not<br />to show up at this point.
3775530 3777656 What else do we have to do, all right?
3777824 3780367 He's about to show them the<br />only cards that we're holding...
3780535 3784204 - which is that they don't know we're here!<br />- That's the ball game, okay?
3784372 3786498 Look, we don't have any other choice!
3786666 3789001 Who says that we'll know<br />our covers well enough?
3789168 3790919 We're not in the CIA.
3792046 3793672 It's suicide.
3793840 3795924 I'm asking you to trust me.
3797343 3798510 I don't trust you.
3801055 3803599 This is the game, Joe. What<br />world are you living in?
3803766 3807394 The one where they're hanging<br />people from construction cranes, Bob.
3808187 3810647 It's too dangerous. I won't<br />bring my wife into the bazaar.
3812734 3814067 Joe?
3820783 3822618 So we'll see you at 2.
3845475 3850562 So don't be recognizable but look<br />exactly like your passport photo.
3851814 3854274 I haven't been this<br />nervous since our wedding.
3856069 3858153 Only this isn't a huge<br />mistake, hopefully.
3859614 3861490 Sorry. Okay.
3864243 3870083 Hello?
3878466 3879758 Who was that?
3883096 3884805 - Mark?<br />- Yeah?
3887100 3888684 I'm scared.
3891020 3892270 It's okay.
3940153 3941319 Where are they?
3941487 3942821 In the kitchen.
3959756 3963216 This is what I do. I get people out.
3964719 3967554 And I've never left anyone behind.
3969265 3971600 I wish I could believe you, Mr. Harkins.
3976731 3980025 My name is Tony Mendez.<br />I'm from New York.
3980193 3982944 My father worked construction. My<br />mother teaches elementary school.
3983112 3985489 I have a wife and<br />a 10-year-old son.
3987909 3992579 You play along with me today, I promise<br />you, I will get you out tomorrow.
3996959 3998668 Fuck.
4039252 4041127 Shit.
4068155 4069656 Hang on.
4117830 4119456 You all right?
4124712 4126880 Okay. Tell me who you are.
4127590 4129841 Mike McEwan, cameraman.
4130384 4132594 Robert Baker, director.
4133054 4135055 Timothy Harris, location manager.
4135222 4137223 Mary Ann Boyd, screenwriter.
4137391 4139142 Rachel Dewart, production designer.
4139352 4141061 Sean Bissett, associate producer.
4141228 4143772 All right. Let's go make a movie.
4157078 4159079 Welcome, welcome. My<br />name is Reza Bolhani.
4159246 4161623 - Kevin Harkins. I'm the producer.<br />- Nice to meet you.
4161791 4163416 This is Mike McEwan, our cameraman.
4163584 4165794 This is Tim. This is<br />Mary, our screenwriter.
4165962 4167462 And this is our director, Bob Baker.
4167630 4169381 - You are the director?<br />- Yes.
4169548 4172008 Is this film a foreign-bride film?
4172927 4174219 Sorry?
4174387 4176846 A film where a foreign<br />bride comes to Iran...
4177014 4180558 ...but she doesn't understand<br />the language or the customs...
4180726 4183269 ...and there is<br />misunderstandings and laughs.
4183437 4184896 Oh, no.
4190111 4195573 The bazaar in Tehran is one<br />of the largest in the world.
4196158 4200328 This bazaar has been on this<br />spot for over 8000 years.
4200496 4204708 You can find many items<br />such as paper, spices...
4204917 4207419 ...precious metals, all right here.
4207586 4208795 Right this way, please.
4214176 4215552 This way.
4230651 4231943 - Uh, Mike?<br />- Yeah.
4232111 4235131 If I was to say you're looking through<br />the wrong end of that viewfinder,
4235132 4236281 ...would I be right?
4238576 4240160 Yup.
4247376 4248501 Just a little further.
4278491 4281743 Please wait here. Let's stay together.
4298552 4300303 He wants the photograph you took.
4300471 4303556 It's okay, it's her job to take<br />photographs. She's the production designer.
4303724 4306976 He says he did not give you permission<br />to take a photograph of his store.
4307144 4309813 That's okay. You can<br />tell him he can have it.
4311107 4313191 Please, please, just<br />take the photograph.
4322993 4324035 Peace be upon you.
4324203 4325578 SAHAR: And upon you, sir. Welcome.
4325746 4326996 I hope you are well.
4327164 4328832 Thank you very much. How are you?
4329041 4331417 I'm very well. What's your name?
4331585 4332752 Sahar.
4343764 4346933 He's saying that the shah killed<br />his son with an American gun.
4356610 4358987 No, no, no! No! Canada!
4359155 4360196 Canada!
4360364 4362657 I would like to suggest<br />that we end our visit.
4372001 4373084 You know, sister...
4373252 4377255 ...those who are with him, Rasool of<br />Allah, we are tender among ourselves.
4377423 4378965 But stern against the Kufar.
4379592 4381009 As God wills it.
4382636 4385847 But those who sit silently have sinned.
4387308 4389309 How else may I help, sir?
4389476 4391811 No, no, just one thing.
4393689 4395315 How long have they been here?
4396567 4397609 Pardon?
4398944 4400653 The guests of the Ambassador.
4400654 4402030 The guests of the Ambassador.<br />How long have they been here?
4404909 4406492 They arrived two days ago.
4407286 4411998 Forgive my intrusion,<br />one must be vigilant.
4413292 4416169 Everyone in this house<br />is a friend of Iran.
4450704 4452163 How'd it go?
4453791 4455416 What about tomorrow?
4456752 4458294 Tomorrow they'll be ready.
4462216 4464509 For Kennedy, a stunning turnaround...
4464677 4466719 ...one week after<br />humiliation in Illinois.
4466887 4468179 I love New York.
4469556 4472100 And I love Connecticut too.
4472268 4474894 How did he win here? Well, he had help.
4475062 4479691 I'm responsible for anything that<br />goes wrong in this government.
4479858 4483903 A man in Scranton is placing a flag<br />in his lawn for every day of captivity.
4484905 4488032 When he runs out of lawn,<br />Kennedy wins the primary.
4488575 4490994 The six with the<br />Canadians are coming out.
4502047 4503631 Who signed off on this?
4503799 4506592 - You. Where was your passport issued?<br />- Vancouver.
4506760 4508052 - Where were you born?<br />- Toronto.
4508220 4510221 "Torono. " Canadians<br />don't pronounce the T.
4510389 4512807 Some Komiteh guard is<br />actually gonna know that?
4512975 4516769 If you're detained for questioning, they<br />will bring in someone who knows that. Yes.
4516937 4520148 Mary, who were the last three<br />prime ministers of Canada?
4520607 4523109 Trudeau, Pearson and Diefenbaker.
4523277 4524944 - What's your father's name?<br />- Howard.
4525112 4526863 - What's his occupation?<br />- Fisherman.
4527031 4529282 - Where were you born?<br />- Halifax, Nova Scotia.
4529450 4531200 What's your date of birth?

4535831 4538583 - Associate. Last movie you produced?<br />- High and Dry.
4538751 4540251 - Who paid for that?<br />- CFDC.
4540419 4542754 What's your middle name?<br />What's your middle name?
4542921 4544630 - Leon?<br />- Shoot him. He's an American spy.
4546342 4550094 Look, they're gonna try to break you,<br />okay? By trying to get you agitated.
4550262 4552388 You have to know your<br />resume back to front.
4552556 4555601 You really believe your little story's<br />gonna make a difference...
4555602 4556893 ...when there's a gun to our heads?
4557811 4560980 I think my story's the only thing<br />between you and a gun to your head.
4564318 4565360 Okay.
4570574 4573534 Hey, they made it through<br />the location scout.
4585798 4587173 You have a call.
4598102 4599143 What is it?
4599311 4600395 Go to black on green.
4603107 4604190 Go.
4604358 4605817 - It all just changed.<br />- What?
4605984 4607776 They're calling the game.<br />You gotta come back.
4607777 4608569 What?
4608737 4611447 Joint Chiefs are planning a<br />military rescue of the hostages.
4611615 4614158 Delta Force has started<br />training to storm the grounds.
4614326 4616202 So if the six of them...
4616370 4619997 ...are brought down there,<br />they won't be held for long.
4620833 4624544 Fuck. Goddamn it. I never would have exposed<br />them if I wasn't authorized to get them out.
4624711 4627422 - It's over, Tony.<br />- If they stay here, they will be taken.
4627589 4632343 - Probably not alive.<br />- Listen to me. The thinking has changed.
4632511 4636180 Six Americans get pulled out of a<br />Canadian diplomat's house and executed...
4636348 4638266 ...it's a world outrage.
4638434 4641394 Six Americans get caught<br />playing movie make-believe...
4641562 4644230 ...with the CIA at the<br />airport and executed?
4644398 4649277 It's a national embarrassment.<br />They are calling the operation.
4651530 4654073 We're responsible for these people.
4655075 4657869 What we are is required<br />to follow orders.
4658745 4660121 I'm sorry.
4669506 4670882 Fuck!
4677723 4678764 Come in.
4680392 4681976 Ready to try again.
4684229 4686981 You're ready. You worked hard.
4688150 4691027 Probably the best thing to do<br />for you right now would be...
4691904 4693321 ...just to relax.
4694156 4695198 Okay.
4695741 4697200 You did good.
4698118 4699410 Thanks.
4711798 4715092 Scorched-earth policy tonight.
4716803 4718638 Nothing gets left.
4725771 4727188 So you know.
4728982 4732777 ExtAff wants you to burn the<br />passports before you leave.
4734947 4738950 If we tell them now, they'll panic. I<br />think it's best if you just don't show.
4741453 4743496 It was always a fucked mission.
4744164 4746457 You came closer than anybody else.
4750420 4762223 If it keeps on rainin'<br />Levee's goin' to break
4764142 4769814 When the levee breaks<br />I'll have no place to stay
4894439 4899777 Ahem. It's off. They want<br />us to pack up the office.
4901488 4903614 This can wait. Let's go get a drink.
4928932 4930850 He's late.
4944281 4945322 O'Donnell.
4945490 4946741 Somebody's responsible...
4946908 4948743 ...when things happen, Jack.
4949411 4950953 I'm responsible.
4951163 4953748 - I'm taking them through.<br />- Tony?
4963675 4968095 Alan. Alan. We need to confirm those<br />seven tickets out of Tehran on Swissair.
4968263 4970556 - N.E. shut that down.<br />- I say it's back on.
4970724 4973476 - I can't do it. It's backstopped.<br />- Hey, wait a minute.
4973643 4976645 What the hell you talking about,<br />backstopped? What the hell's that mean?
4976813 4979607 Carter's gotta say yes<br />for us to get the tickets.
4989409 4990618 It's time to go.
5000962 5002004 All right.
5003757 5006550 - Where's Engell?<br />- He's in a meeting.
5006718 5009637 - Pull him out.<br />- Uh...
5009805 5010971 Pull him out!
5011139 5012973 Thank you so much. I<br />really appreciate it.
5013558 5015226 - Thank you.<br />- See you soon.
5015393 5017311 - Sahar's on a bus.<br />- Great.
5017479 5018896 Sahar will be fine.
5019064 5020815 - Thank you.<br />- Thank you.
5021066 5024318 - You two leave right now, right?<br />- We'll be on a train in half an hour.
5024486 5025569 Good.
5029157 5030366 N.E. said no.
5030534 5035204 This is not a long leasher, and it never<br />has been, and you don't decide if it goes!
5035372 5036580 It is going!
5036748 5038749 Jack, you are this close.
5038917 5040793 Am I? Am I really that close?
5040961 5042920 You are this goddamn<br />close to the line with me.
5043088 5046632 I am not gonna leave him at the airport<br />with six people and his dick in his hand.
5046800 5050261 You tell the director to call the<br />White House. Do your fucking job!
5058895 5059979 Get to your plane, Claude.
5066987 5070447 First time anyone's gonna ask you a<br />question is at the first checkpoint.
5071116 5073617 The first checkpoint is just<br />to get a look at your passports.
5073994 5077788 Passports came straight from<br />Ottawa last week. They're clean.
5078206 5080040 Find the White House chief of staff.
5080208 5081292 How would I find him?
5081459 5084461 We're a fucking spy agency! Find him!
5085213 5088549 The second checkpoint is immigration.
5088717 5090467 You're each gonna<br />hand them one of these.
5090635 5093220 It says that you landed in<br />the country two days ago.
5093972 5096807 They'll look for the matching<br />white one, which doesn't exist.
5096975 5098767 You'll say you don't know what happened.
5098935 5100853 And if you believe they<br />lost the white slip...
5102105 5103188 ...they'll believe it too.
5104065 5107151 Jordan's in the West Wing.<br />He's not taking calls.
5108653 5110154 Where are his kids?
5110322 5111363 What?
5111531 5113073 Where do his kids go to school?
5120165 5121582 Thank you, thank you.
5121750 5124001 Pace Academy, Buckhead, Georgia.
5127380 5128422 White House.
5128590 5133177 Yes, this is Mr. Murphy from Pace<br />Academy calling for Mr. Jordan.
5133345 5135679 Yeah, I'm afraid it is an emergency.
5135847 5138057 Hold for the chief of staff's office.
5138266 5140809 The third checkpoint is the trap.
5140977 5142603 It's manned by the Revolutionary Guard.
5143229 5145481 Most of them were educated<br />in the U.S. or Europe.
5146024 5148901 And all of whom are<br />looking for Americans.
5160747 5161789 Hello?
5161957 5163749 - Jack O'Donnell, from C.I.<br />- Wait, wait, who?
5163917 5167711 Tehran Houseguest operation is ready now.<br />We don't have the president's go-ahead.
5167879 5169964 They are going to be captured.
5170131 5171256 David, pick up!
5188900 5191443 Zurich. It's under Harkins.
5199619 5202287 I'm sorry, sir, I don't seem<br />to have these reservations.
5205834 5207751 Telex on flash.
5208670 5210754 Would you mind checking again, please?
5219431 5222182 Copy D.S. Confirm the tickets! Go!
5235697 5237281 My apologies. It just came through.
5244956 5246665 Swissair says they<br />picked up the tickets.
5246833 5249501 Get the L.A. office, tell them<br />to be ready in case they call.
5249669 5251795 We told them to shut that down.
5282911 5284328 There you go.
5301179 5302596 Not here.
5365827 5367578 When did you come to Iran?
5368121 5369913 Two days ago.
5370081 5371748 What was the purpose of your visit?
5372834 5375419 We are looking for locations for a film.
5382218 5383302 We have a...
5383469 5388348 Oh, yeah. I've got a letter<br />from the Ministry of Culture.
5389267 5391518 If you want to take a<br />look at that. All right?
5411706 5413749 - Ahem.<br />- You can go.
5423301 5424968 Come on, come on.
5435480 5441144 Swissair Flight 363 is<br />now boarding Rows 18 to 35.
5476354 5478605 We're going to...
5507135 5510846 We're together, yes. The<br />six of us, we're from Canada.
5512348 5514433 Purser's telling Swissair<br />they're not on the plane.
5514600 5516101 They should have boarded already.
5516269 5517853 Still no answer in L.A.
5542920 5544087 Sir.
5554098 5557601 STAFFORD: Yes, it's a fantasy<br />story about a war in another world.
5557769 5559478 Here you can see our notices.
5563775 5565650 Of course I speak Farsi.
5565818 5568028 I wish to make a film in Iran.
5584796 5588256 No, I'm the writer.
5588466 5590342 Kevin, give me the storyboards.
5590927 5594971 These are the drawings that show<br />what we will film for the movie.
5595139 5597808 Alien villains have taken<br />over the hero's planet.
5597975 5601144 They fight for their families<br />and take back the city.
5601312 5604327 The villains know he is the chosen one,
5604328 5607651 so they kidnap his son<br />in the spice market.
5609195 5611822 So he and his wife storm the castle.
5611989 5616219 The people... hold that...<br />the people are inspired to join him.
5616220 5618995 They are farmers, but they learn to fight.
5622750 5624543 They shoot weapons at their enemies.
5628756 5632008 And the king of the aliens is destroyed<br />when the people find their courage.
5641185 5643311 You don't go until we verify.
5647859 5649901 I understand.
5650069 5652237 Sir, you can call our office.
5652405 5653738 They'll verify.

5681818 5682973 We're just going to<br />the Producers Building.
5682974 5685896 Yeah, I understand.<br />We're shooting right now.

6129965 6131007 We got wheels up.

6159745 6161245 I love you.
6203288 6205581 They're clear.<br />Ha-ha-ha!
6205749 6207250 Yes! Yes!
6208127 6210253 - Yeah!<br />- Yes!
6210421 6211587 Yeah, man.
6212047 6213756 They're out!
6213924 6217135 - They're out! They're out!<br />- We got them out!
6220472 6221597 They're out!
6225978 6227603 Yes!
6227771 6229939 Great work, boys.
6230107 6231107 We did it!
6243120 6246289 You are admitted to<br />the Republic of Iraq.
6290834 6292668 We made history tonight.
6293837 6297173 History starts out as farce<br />and ends up as tragedy.
6297716 6299342 Quote's the other way around.
6300010 6302512 - Yeah, who said it?<br />- Marx.
6303430 6304472 Groucho said that?
6309019 6311521 Call the Times, nail<br />it to the goddamn door.
6311688 6313397 CIA are the good guys.
6313565 6315399 The Canadians are the good guys.
6315567 6317276 Yeah, we're not greedy. Them too.
6318028 6322532 Only. Canada takes the credit, or<br />they retaliate against the hostages.
6323367 6325201 Great Satan wasn't involved.
6325953 6327954 No CIA.
6328163 6329705 Is that right, Jack?
6331875 6333584 Involved in what?
6334586 6337088 We were as surprised as anybody.
6340050 6341759 Thank you, Canada.
6341969 6344637 We knew that each day<br />they stayed there...
6344805 6347473 ...the danger was becoming greater.
6347683 6351727 We had been looking for a solution to have them<br />leave the country during the past three months.
6351895 6354564 Day 87, and finally a<br />sliver of really good news.
6354731 6358526 The U.S. Department of State<br />hereby honors Joe Stafford...
6360028 6361445 ...Kathy Stafford...
6362739 6364448 ...Mark Lijek...
6365075 6370288 We Americans will be forever grateful to<br />our great friend and ally to the north...
6370455 6374709 ...for the protection and the safe<br />passage provided for our diplomats.
6374877 6376127 Bob Anders.
6376295 6379005 Here, or anywhere in the world...
6379173 6380756 ...Canada will pay...
6382092 6386095 ...for this violation of<br />the sovereignty of Iran.
6386263 6390474 Thank you to Pat and Ken Taylor<br />and the great nation of Canada.
6394313 6397023 So I'm sitting in Jerry's this<br />morning, I'm having breakfast.
6397191 6400276 Waitress comes over to me, she's<br />waving a newspaper, and she says:
6400444 6403821 "You see what those Canadians pulled off?<br />Why can't we do something like that?"
6404615 6406449 And I said to her...<br />Do you know what I said?
6406867 6407992 No, what?
6408535 6409994 "Argo fuck yourself. "
6438774 6439815 All set.
6440776 6442151 Thanks a lot.
6453288 6454288 Ha!
6455666 6459168 Heh. And I left my<br />autograph book at home.
6464800 6466509 His Eminence called me.
6466677 6467885 He wants to see you.
6468387 6470096 Probably wants to fire me himself.
6471223 6473557 He wants to give you<br />the Intelligence Star.
6474768 6476602 You're getting the<br />highest award of merit...
6476812 6480147 ...of the Clandestine Services<br />of these United States.
6481108 6483025 Ceremony's on the 14th.
6483193 6486362 If they push it a week, I can<br />bring Ian. That's his winter break.
6487864 6492201 The op was classified, so<br />the ceremony's classified.
6492369 6495413 He can't know about it.<br />Nobody can know about it.
6496957 6500042 So they're just gonna give me an award<br />and then they're gonna take it back.
6500627 6501669 That's right.
6503547 6505881 If we wanted applause, we<br />would've joined the circus.
6507592 6509719 - I thought we did.<br />- Ha.
6510387 6513180 Carter said you were a great American.
6513890 6515558 Great American what?
6516101 6517560 He didn't say.
6530907 6532158 What happened to your picture?
6533785 6534994 It's in turnaround.
6577287 6578871 Can I come in?
6624877 6628788 The Iran Hostage Crisis ended<br />on January 20, 1981,
6628789 6633221 ...when all remaining hostages were released.<br />They spent 444 days in captivity.
6637222 6640299 The involvement of the<br />C.I.A. complemented efforts of
6640300 6643490 the Canadian embassy in<br />freeing the six held in Tehran.
6643530 6646166 To this day, this story<br />stands as an enduring model
6646167 6648650 for international cooperation<br />between governments.
6648776 6653261 All of the Houseguests<br />returned to the U.S. Foreign Service
6653262 6655204 after their ordeal in Iran.
6656742 6661872 Oscar-winning makeup artist John Chambers<br />was awarded the C.I.A.'s Intelligence Medal,
6661898 6663385 its highest civilian honor.
6663386 6666745 He and Mendez remained friends until<br />Chambers' death in 2001.
6668504 6671935 Tony Mendez's Intelligence Star<br />was returned to him in 1997,
6671961 6675504 when the Argo operation was<br />declassified by President Clinton.
6685521 6691497 He lives in rural Maryland with his family.
6805932 6811136 They went in, as you know, under the<br />guise of creating a motion-picture film.
6811146 6815874 But that it had a very<br />high possibility of failure.
6815942 6818235 And after it was successful, of course...
6818403 6821196 ...it was a great temptation<br />to reveal all the stories...
6821364 6824883 ...so maybe I could take a little bit of<br />credit for it, since I was president...
6824951 6830138 ...but we had to keep it secret.<br />Tony Mendez has gone down in CIA history...
6830206 6831582 ...after his retirement...
6831750 6837689 ...as one of the 50 most important<br />CIA operatives of all time.
6839215 6844595 Eventually we got every hostage<br />back home, safe and sound...
6844763 6848766 ...and we upheld the integrity of<br />our country, and we did it peacefully.
