38042 43042 EYES WITHOUT A FACE
341792 343417 The professor?
344000 345583 No, not yet.
351667 353917 I'll tell him, once he's finished.
354083 357000 Is not the greatest<br />of man's new hopes
357167 360708 that of physical rejuvenation?
361375 362792 This hope
362958 365375 comes with the heterograft.
366167 369292 But the heterograft...<br />in other words, the transplanting
369458 374583 of living tissue or organs<br />from one human being to another...
374750 376667 has only been possible until now
376833 379750 when both subjects in question
380333 383792 were perfectly identical<br />from a biological standpoint.
385417 387833 This means biologically modifying
388000 392625 the nature of the host organism.
393417 397375 One method involves using
397542 401083 heavy X-ray irradiation
401250 405708 to destroy the antibodies that create<br />resistance to the heterograft.
406333 411417 Unfortunately, this irradiation<br />requires such a high level of intensity
413500 416208 that no human being can survive it.
417667 420375 So we resort to exsanguination.
421500 424875 We drain every last drop of blood
425042 426792 from the subject<br />exposed to radiation.
434583 438125 - You just had a call, Professor.<br />- From whom?
438333 441542 The medico-legal...<br />You know, the morgue.
442333 444792 They want to see you right away.<br />- Oh, Professor,
445000 447875 your lecture was so invigorating.
448042 450083 Thrilling, wasn't it, Carlo?
450250 452667 What a wonderful future<br />you've shown us.
452833 457042 The future, madame, is something<br />we should have started on long ago.
465625 468625 He's changed so much<br />since his daughter vanished.
468792 470667 He says such strange things.
479958 483333 <i>It's a strange business,<br />but that's how it looks to me.</i>
483917 487333 When Génessier's daughter<br />vanished from the clinic,
487500 490458 her face was an open wound.
490625 494833 True, the missing facial tissue<br />confirms your theory.
496292 498167 The car accident,
498333 502125 the facial burns,<br />the long immersion in the river.
502333 505208 And the rats, Doctor.<br />Don't forget the rats.
505375 506625 True.
507667 512792 Still, the drowning victim's description<br />also fits that of Simone Tessot.
513000 515542 I called the Tessot girl's father down.
517333 519875 Something doesn't quite make sense.
520042 524458 What's odd is the body was fished out<br />naked... in a man's coat.
526208 528625 Why should Génessier's daughter,
528792 531750 distraught at her disfigurement,
532500 534292 feel the need to strip naked
534458 537958 in mid-winter<br />before drowning herself?
541833 544625 And that large open wound<br />where the face should be...
545417 547167 it's strange.
547333 551583 The edges are as smooth as if<br />someone had taken a scalpel to them.
556625 558333 Here he is.
585625 587000 Dr. Lherminier.
587167 590083 Detective Parot,<br />of the Missing Persons Bureau.
600000 604500 I'm so sorry we had to meet<br />under such unfortunate circumstances.
605125 606333 Let's hear it.
606500 609792 This morning, bargemen fished<br />a girl's body out of the Seine.
610542 612500 The time of drowning coincides
612667 616417 with that of your daughter's<br />disappearance.
618000 620083 The description also fits.
620250 624167 The damaged face...<br />Only the eyes are intact.
635292 637667 IDENTIFICATION ROOM
663292 664833 It's her.
667458 669083 Christiane.
678500 680125 Mr. Tessot is here, Doctor.
680708 685208 Tell him she's been identified<br />beyond a doubt. It's not his daughter.
688333 689625 I called him in, in case...
692750 694292 Of course.
703250 707250 Excuse me, Professor.<br />I'm Henri Tessot.
707417 709917 I'm also here about my daughter.
710083 712625 The custodian said she was yours.
712833 716750 Are you really sure, sir?<br />Are you very sure?
716958 719958 Sadly, sir, only too sure.
720958 724000 It was such a shock when they phoned.
724167 726042 I thought I'd go mad.
726208 729792 It's been 10 days<br />since we last saw Simone.
729958 732500 Something must have happened to her.
734542 738292 How odd I should have to comfort you.
738500 741542 You still have some hope, at least.
814917 818125 She's looking for a room.
839958 842333 With age, he looks<br />more and more like his father.
842500 846875 Remember Génessier, the attorney?<br />No beanpole, either.
847500 850000 He sure has had a string of bad luck.
850792 855250 Losing his wife four years ago...<br />now his daughter.
855417 860625 Paris, fame, fortune...<br />what's it all add up to?
874208 876042 Who's the young man?
876208 878292 The girl's fiancé.
878458 881875 A doctor.<br />He works with the professor.
882042 883458 And the woman?
883625 885958 His secretary, it seems.
886583 888000 A foreigner.
888167 890375 She looks deeply affected.
899292 900833 Go home, son.
916042 917958 No, let's go.
918125 919667 I like order.
940833 943875 Let's go!<br />I can't take any more of this.
949000 950292 Shut up!
960500 963458 TO MY BELOVED DAUGHTER
1037000 1039417 DR. GÉNESSIER'S VILLA
1039583 1043125 NO ADMITTANCE BEYOND THIS POINT
1251458 1253292 Where did you find this?
1254625 1256667 I don't like your snooping around.
1259417 1262583 I have no time to explain it<br />to you just now.
1263000 1265625 Sure, you see your name<br />with a black border around it.
1268375 1271458 What can you possibly be imagining?
1272083 1274000 I don't have to imagine a thing.
1274167 1277792 I see horrible things.<br />I'm living them!
1277958 1279917 What have you done now?
1280125 1282042 What had to be done.
1282833 1284542 For your own good.
1285500 1287875 Always for your good, Christiane.
1290333 1292042 An obituary notice.
1293000 1296292 Names were simply substituted.
1301792 1305500 Since that girl died<br />after the operation,
1307292 1309833 I took an additional risk.
1310875 1313625 I made everyone believe it was you.
1315375 1320458 Everyone thinks you're dead.<br />They won't look any further.
1322208 1324792 They won't come around<br />asking what happened.
1325917 1329125 Christiane, your mask!
1329333 1333542 Get into the habit of wearing it.
1335167 1336875 Where did you hide it?
1337042 1339000 The habit...
1339417 1342458 I only meant<br />the habit of wearing it
1342667 1346375 until we succeed.
1348167 1350208 Please don't cry, darling.
1353000 1355708 I'll succeed, I promise you.
1357833 1360375 I don't believe it anymore.
1373708 1376292 There's no reason for you<br />to doubt me.
1378208 1380625 I know my abilities, don't I?
1382875 1385125 You'll have a real face.
1385875 1387958 I promise you.
1395000 1397542 They've removed all the mirrors.
1397708 1400125 But I can see<br />my reflection in the glass
1400292 1402583 when the windows are open.
1402750 1404833 There are lots of shiny surfaces...
1405625 1407333 a knife blade,
1408208 1409792 varnished wood...
1409958 1412500 My face frightens me.
1412667 1415083 My mask frightens me even more.
1415250 1417792 Have faith, Christiane.
1419458 1421458 Look at me.
1421667 1423333 Didn't he succeed with me?
1423500 1425333 But you had a face.
1425958 1430083 Damaged, maybe,<br />but not destroyed like mine.
1430250 1433792 He's lying to me,<br />because he knows it was his fault.
1433958 1435500 His fault?
1435667 1439000 It was a car wreck.<br />It was an accident.
1439167 1443500 Accident? He has to control everyone,<br />even on the road!
1443667 1446250 He drove like a lunatic.
1450000 1454417 The crash nearly killed me.<br />Why did he try so hard to save me?
1455167 1457917 I wish I were blind.
1459167 1460875 Or dead.
1677167 1678750 <i>Who is this?</i>
1679333 1681042 <i>Say something!</i>
1725792 1727833 I see you're alone, miss.
1728000 1729917 I have an extra ticket.
1730083 1732625 My friend didn't show up.
1733417 1735167 I'd be delighted, madame,
1735333 1738417 but I planned to buy<br />an inexpensive seat.
1738583 1741083 Don't worry.<br />I'm not asking you to pay.
1776292 1779000 Sorry I'm late.<br />My class ran overtime.
1779167 1780958 It's all right.
1781167 1784708 I was so anxious<br />to give you the good news.
1784875 1787625 I found you a room.
1788417 1791833 I can't believe it! I'm so glad.
1792000 1793417 How can I ever thank you?
1794667 1798583 First take a look at the room.<br />I think you'll like it.
1798750 1800583 What neighborhood?
1800750 1802792 A lovely neighborhood.
1805875 1807875 The same for the young lady.
1809167 1813292 I'll drive you there.<br />The owners are friends.
1813500 1815625 It's surrounded by trees.
1864833 1866917 It seems very far.
1868042 1870292 I took the long way.
1871042 1874000 The traffic's heavy<br />at this time of day.
1887583 1891125 That's the train<br />that will take you to Paris.
1891333 1893250 In less than 20 minutes.
1895375 1899208 Don't you feel lonely,<br />so far from your family?
1899375 1902625 A little, sometimes.
1980500 1982583 Those dogs...
1983500 1985083 How many are there?
1985250 1988792 You see?<br />You'll be well protected.
2011458 2013458 Miss Edna Grüberg.
2013667 2015500 Mr. Dormeuil.
2015667 2017458 Delighted.
2018750 2021292 Some port<br />to refresh you after the drive?
2021500 2025042 No, thank you, sir.<br />I don't want to stay too long.
2026833 2028875 Come now, there's no hurry.
2034792 2037500 I'll show you your room.
2038125 2040500 It looks out over the trees.
2040667 2042375 I'm sure you'll like it.
2042542 2045292 I don't know.<br />I have to think it over.
2049292 2052333 First, you really must see the room.
2056958 2060333 Of course, at night<br />it's hard to judge.
2060500 2061625 It's not that,
2062500 2065750 but the suburbs<br />aren't very convenient for me.
2066500 2068083 What do you mean?
2068750 2072125 The suburbs are very convenient.<br />Very convenient.
2072333 2074708 Maybe so, but...
2075500 2079083 I don't want to get back<br />to Paris too late tonight.
2080792 2084792 I'm meeting a friend.<br />I'll let you know tomorrow.
2085000 2089125 Tomorrow will be too late, my dear.
2197125 2198667 Open up, quickly.
2251208 2252750 I'll start after dinner.
2253208 2254500 This time...
2255600 2258142 I must try removing<br />a larger section.
2260517 2262767 In one piece.
2263683 2266100 Not in sections.
2581617 2582442 Pencil.
2628067 2629150 Scalpel.
2680400 2681650 Wipe my brow.
2691675 2692592 Pencil.
2714942 2715983 Scalpel.
2743358 2744400 Forceps.
2870608 2872525 Here we go.
2909692 2911400 Did she eat normally?
2911567 2913317 Yes, very well.
2913483 2915775 She'd been wasting away.
2915942 2918358 She's happy this time.<br />She has faith.
2919150 2920150 Finally.
2920858 2923692 I showed her how nicely it's healing.
2923858 2927483 I changed the bandages.<br />It looks fine.
2927650 2929192 Much better than yesterday.
2929400 2931150 I'm so afraid.
2931317 2933233 Don't be.
2933400 2935858 I have faith this time too.
2937775 2939942 All I can do is hope.
2943692 2946358 If this were a success... God!
2946525 2948233 You couldn't put a price on it.
2950942 2953692 I've done so much wrong<br />to perform this miracle.
2955900 2957483 I've done you<br />a lot of wrong, too.
2957650 2962442 I know, but I'll never forget<br />that I owe you my face.
2965608 2967483 I sometimes forget that myself.
2967650 2969067 With good reason.
2969233 2971817 There's hardly any trace now.
2979650 2982358 What have you decided about Edna?
2983317 2985983 Look after her. Feed her.
2987567 2989650 I'll decide later.
3103692 3106108 Edna! She's escaped!
3106275 3107192 That way.
3359858 3362650 No other details that come to mind?
3362817 3364192 Well, no.
3366483 3368525 Yes!
3368733 3372192 Edna said the woman<br />always wore a thick pearl necklace.
3373150 3375358 See what I mean?
3375567 3378275 She wore it high around her neck,<br />like a choker.
3382567 3384775 That doesn't help us much.
3387733 3389317 Please sign.
3395067 3397150 That'll be all, young lady.
3414067 3415817 Pretty, isn't she?
3416400 3418483 The same series of blue-eyed girls.
3420067 3425650 All students, all the same age,<br />all the same type of beauty.
3425817 3428025 And all mysteriously missing.
3428192 3431608 This one's Swiss. You can imagine -<br />the embassy, the phone calls...
3434025 3437775 Speaking of blue-eyed girls,
3437942 3440358 what do I do with mine?
3440525 3443067 She was caught shoplifting.
3444858 3447067 Give her a stern lecture<br />and let her go.
3447233 3451150 But get her address.<br />It might come in handy.
3457358 3460192 This is how you end up in prison.
3460775 3462608 It was the first time.
3462775 3464483 I don't know what got into me.
3465900 3467858 Next time, you'll go to court.
3468483 3470025 Let me have your address.
3470192 3473358 12 rue des Pyrénées,<br />in the 20th arrondissement.
3474817 3476358 Now get lost.
3488608 3491025 I knew I would succeed.
3494525 3496900 To think that you didn't<br />believe in me.
3499275 3501317 Now you have your lovely face.
3503108 3504442 Your real face.
3506733 3509108 You can start life over again.
3510692 3511733 True.
3512692 3515358 But I also have to come<br />back to life for others.
3516650 3518025 How can I?
3519192 3522733 You can start by taking a trip,<br />a long trip.
3524400 3526275 I'll get you new papers.
3528025 3530025 You can choose yourself a name.
3531192 3532608 Won't that be fun?
3533525 3534900 A new face,
3535942 3537483 a new identity.
3538108 3541150 You're more beautiful than ever.
3542192 3545525 There's something angelic<br />about you now.
3548192 3550942 Angelic?<br />I don't know about that.
3552733 3556525 When I look in a mirror,<br />I feel I'm looking at someone
3556692 3558233 who looks like me,
3559275 3562358 but seems to come from the Beyond,
3563150 3564692 from the Beyond.
3565442 3566858 What about Jacques?
3572525 3576233 Obviously, that does pose a problem.
3577858 3579900 I'll explain it to him.
3581858 3583817 He loves you so much.
3586442 3588483 He'll be very happy.
3590233 3591150 Smile.
3592858 3593733 Smile.
3595442 3596983 Not too much.
3617108 3620067 Give him a shot of Pentothal.<br />I'll be right down.
3623858 3625525 Another emergency.
3628192 3631067 Will you come with me?<br />Sorry, darling.
3653650 3655192 You're not wearing makeup, I hope?
3659067 3660150 Why?
3662358 3664192 No reason.
3665192 3667942 You have rosy cheeks, that's all.
3670358 3672275 See you tomorrow, darling.
3678692 3682233 I won't be long.<br />I'll come up to say good night.
3693358 3695275 You looked anxious examining her.
3695525 3698900 You're imagining things.
3701192 3702775 Why are you lying?
3702942 3706442 I've known you long enough<br />to read your face.
3707358 3708775 Tell me the truth.
3712525 3714025 I've failed.
3729025 3730567 <i>February 15.</i>

3735025 3739567 <i>A week after healing,<br />spots of pigmentation appear.</i>
3741317 3747025 <i>Later, palpation reveals<br />small subcutaneous nodules.</i>
3749775 3754650 <i>On Day 12, necrosis<br />of the graft tissue is apparent.</i>
3756483 3758067 <i>Day 20...</i>
3759358 3765567 <i>The first ulcerations and signs<br />of rejection of the graft tissue.</i>
3766525 3769400 <i>The necrotic graft tissue<br />must be removed.</i>
3804608 3809150 With any old dog,<br />everything's possible.
3812025 3816733 I'll have to settle<br />for this beastliness.
3871192 3873067 I'm listening.
3875358 3876942 Say something.
3877108 3878650 This is infuriating!
3880525 3881442 Say something!
3883442 3884817 Jacques...
3896358 3898817 Are you mad?<br />Who were you calling?
3899275 3900442 No one.
3901025 3903358 Do you realize<br />how reckless you're being?
3904275 3907025 I know.<br />The dead should keep quiet.
3907192 3909733 Then let me be dead for good.
3910525 3911942 I can't stand it anymore!
3912900 3914983 I don't dare look at myself.
3915525 3917900 I can't touch my face
3919192 3922733 for fear of feeling the furrows<br />and crevices in my skin.
3922900 3926192 It feels like rubber!
3928192 3931817 Calm down, my dear.<br />Trust in him.
3931983 3933525 I'm sure he'll succeed.
3934483 3936983 He never will.
3937192 3939733 He'll keep experimenting<br />on me like one of his dogs.
3940358 3942983 A human guinea pig.<br />What a godsend for him!
3943733 3945483 You have no right to say that.
3946400 3949150 I want to die... please!
3949900 3954650 There are those injections he gives<br />the dogs when things go wrong!
3957358 3958608 Stop talking like that!
3959358 3962900 You have to kill me.<br />I can't stand it anymore!
3971525 3973275 Come up, quickly!
3974858 3977400 I'm sure of it.<br />I heard Christiane's voice.
3977608 3981025 You thought you did.<br />Over the phone.
3981692 3983775 Did you mention it<br />to Professor Génessier?
3983942 3987525 Of course. But he insists<br />he identified his daughter's body.
3987692 3989525 I know. I was there.
3990317 3991858 What can I say?
3992483 3994858 Maybe it was a practical joke.
3995942 3997275 Still...
3997442 4000358 Well, Doctor, I deal in facts.
4001025 4003567 These files are filled<br />with testimonies.
4003733 4007150 "I think that... "<br />"My feeling is that... "
4007900 4010150 A lot of vague descriptions. Here:
4010317 4012317 The red taxi picking up a girl.
4012525 4016150 The handsome woman<br />with a pearl choker
4016317 4018317 who was seen with the other girl.
4019692 4021858 A pearl choker?
4024692 4026858 That ring a bell?
4027025 4028608 Hold on.
4030358 4033025 Yes, it reminds me of someone.
4066692 4069192 But the other day you said<br />I was off the hook.
4069817 4073108 I hoped so, Miss Paulette Mérodon,
4073692 4076192 but the case went higher up.
4076483 4078192 They say I was too easy on you.
4081317 4084358 So that means I'm done for.
4085692 4088983 Does that mean prison?<br />- There's the trial first.
4089733 4091483 The trial!
4094067 4096525 My parents will never get over it.
4098317 4100150 I've been thinking.
4100900 4103983 There may be a way to avoid all this.
4106317 4108983 Obviously, it would involve<br />a great deal of discretion.
4109858 4111442 And some intelligence.
4111608 4115025 I can be very discreet.<br />And as for intelligence...
4115775 4117317 if it's not too complicated.
4117525 4119317 You'll see.
4119483 4122192 You just have to do us<br />a little favor.
4122358 4126692 - What do I have to do?<br />- Bleach your hair, for starters.
4126858 4130442 - You're kidding.<br />- That's not our style.
4131358 4134108 You have to be much blonder.
4134692 4136942 - It won't suit me.<br />- It doesn't matter.
4137108 4141358 Then a doctor will have you<br />admitted to a clinic.
4141525 4144233 - But I'm not sick!<br />- You'll say you are.
4145192 4147733 Brief her on the details.
4148525 4151567 At the clinic,<br />you'll complain of migraines.
4151733 4153692 I'll write it all down.
4154483 4156858 I'll give you a note for Dr. Gleize.
4160817 4163567 He'll give you a letter<br />for Dr. Génessier.
4165692 4167067 Speaking.
4171692 4173233 What's that?
4174025 4175733 Wait, I'll write it down.
4183358 4185942 She can be admitted<br />tomorrow morning.
4188025 4190733 Don't worry.<br />I'll keep an eye on her.
4190900 4193817 Sure, it's just to check out a hunch.
4196733 4200650 If anything happens,<br />I'll let you know immediately.
4219233 4220650 You're coming along fine.
4220817 4222358 Just fine, Doctor.
4230317 4232692 The young lady<br />was admitted this morning.
4232858 4234942 - The attending physician?<br />- Dr. Gleize.
4236025 4237608 Here's his letter.
4244067 4245650 You're in great pain?
4247400 4248817 Yes.
4248983 4251317 At times.
4254233 4259483 Do a funduscopy<br />and an electroencephalogram today.
4262442 4264192 Are you going to shave my head?
4266192 4268150 I hope not, anyway.
4268358 4270067 That would be a shame.
4277692 4282483 An e... lectro... encephalogram...
4300358 4301900 Don't be afraid.
4302692 4304567 We're friends.
4305358 4307317 Don't touch your forehead.
4310525 4312733 Tell me how many fingers<br />I'm holding up.
4327775 4329108 Three.
4333358 4335942 And now... how many?
4338192 4339275 Three.
4341150 4343650 No... two.
4374525 4377067 What do you think, Doctor?
4377233 4378817 I'm hopeful.
4381233 4383192 Tell me, Doctor.
4384483 4385692 Can you save him?
4385858 4387442 Of course we can.
4388525 4390108 Trust me.
4396192 4398025 Your prognosis?
4398192 4399733 And yours?
4400775 4402317 We agree.
4409358 4410900 Close your eyes.
4413108 4414858 Open your eyes.
4427858 4430233 That's it.<br />You can open your eyes.
4434358 4437733 You'll feel a slight electric shock.<br />It won't hurt.
4439358 4440900 Don't move.
4452525 4453567 Close.
4457858 4459233 Continue.
4463358 4464900 Open your eyes.
4465983 4467525 Close them.
4491192 4493942 Bring me the chart<br />as soon as you've finished.
4506025 4509233 Nothing seems to be wrong<br />with this Paulette Mérodon girl.
4523733 4526317 Bed 15 is hemorrhaging, sir.
4527067 4529108 Take care of it, Jacques.
4570692 4572400 Here's the chart, sir.
4577192 4579900 No abnormalities.
4580858 4582900 Release her tonight.
4583067 4584983 It will free up a bed.
4585733 4588483 We may have an emergency tonight.
4611525 4614900 - Do I give this form to you?<br />- That's right.
4615067 4617817 - May I make a call?<br />- To Paris?
4618567 4621608 - What number?<br />- 4284.
4632692 4635067 Mom? It's Paulette.
4635233 4637650 Everything's fine.<br />I'm coming home.
4637817 4639275 See you in a bit.
4640192 4642192 - What do I owe you?<br />- There's no charge.
4642775 4645067 How can I get back to Paris?
4645233 4649483 By bus. Turn left as you leave.<br />It's a 15-minute walk.
4676858 4681108 Can I give you a lift, miss?<br />I'm going your way.
4681275 4682817 With pleasure, madame.
4697025 4698567 Inspector Parot?
4699358 4701317 It's Jacques Vernon.
4703400 4704858 What's that, Doctor?
4705817 4707525 She left already?
4707692 4709942 They don't drag<br />their feet at your clinic.
4710983 4713192 They sure don't keep them locked up.
4716192 4717900 What did I tell you?
4718525 4721400 But we'll check to make sure<br />she got home safely.
4721858 4724067 Thanks for letting us know.
4741858 4744192 There are two men<br />asking for you at the clinic.
4744358 4746233 You know I don't have time.
4747192 4748733 Tell them to come back tomorrow.
4839358 4841775 Sorry to disturb you at this hour.
4841942 4846858 We want to know if Miss Paulette Mérodon<br />checked out earlier.
4848608 4850650 How did you know<br />she was checking out?
4851233 4854858 She called home to say<br />she was on her way.
4855025 4858275 She never arrived.
4858442 4860692 So we came down to check.
4862275 4864317 Easy enough.
4865108 4868150 I gave the order<br />to release the patient.
4869942 4874192 Has Paulette Mérodon been released?<br />- I'll see.
4877275 4880692 So, interested<br />in this young lady, are you?
4882025 4885733 She's mixed up in a case we're on.
4886525 4888692 We wanted to talk to her tonight.
4890150 4893442 I have a feeling<br />that you're a little late.
4893608 4896025 Paulette Mérodon. Here it is.
4896942 4902025 I remember now: A girl with blue eyes.<br />She made a call from here.
4902192 4904608 I told her where she could<br />catch the bus.
4906192 4907775 You see?
4908525 4910108 I'm sorry,
4911025 4912858 but once they walk<br />through those doors,
4913025 4915358 my patients are no longer<br />my responsibility.
4916108 4918358 I understand.
4919150 4922150 Again, sorry to disturb you.
4923108 4925025 Don't mention it.
4933733 4936275 Well, good night, Professor.
4937900 4942317 Since you're leaving, Jacques,<br />please show these gentlemen out.
4969525 4971650 I'm sorry I wasted your time.
4971817 4973358 It's nothing.
4974358 4976983 We're used to following up bum leads.
4978400 4981858 And I put myself in your place.<br />You start getting ideas...
4983650 4986150 It's all these coincidences.
4986358 4988317 I wanted to put my mind at ease.
4988483 4990858 So we've put our mind at ease.
4991817 4993775 As for your heart,
4993942 4998692 I'm sure things will work out<br />for you on that end.
4999608 5001858 You're young, Doctor.
5002025 5003775 You have your life ahead of you.
5082317 5083858 Put that down!
5095358 5097025 Why?
