223480 225436 Get Adrian.
238680 241194 How's everybody doin' out there?
241320 243834 Everything's OK.
245240 247196 What's wrong?
249040 253830 - What's wrong?<br />- Remember when Mick said
253960 256599 when he was fighting sometimes,
256720 262590 he'd fight so hard that he was thinking<br />that he broke something inside?
262720 265393 He was gonna die?
265520 271356 And that's what he said, that's when<br />the angels was pulling on him.
271480 274756 Rocky, you're scaring me.<br />l don't know what's wrong.
274880 277440 - l can't...<br />- Can't what?
280560 283074 l can't stop my hands from shaking.
286320 289312 - l ain't never felt this thing.<br />- You better see a doctor.
289440 292159 No. l just wanna go home.
292280 294236 No. You can see a doctor.
294360 296749 l'm just tired.
296880 299314 l just wanna go home, Mick.
300120 302793 - l'm just tired. l just...<br />- OK.
302920 305354 - l just wanna go home, OK?<br />- OK.
326720 329439 - Adrian, where's the kid?<br />- l don't know.
330480 334189 l don't see the kid.<br />Where's the kid? Ain't he here?
334840 337195 - Dad!<br />- There he is!
337320 340198 Hey, slugger! How you doin'?
340320 342117 - Say hi to your mom.<br />- Hi, Mom.
342240 344356 - l'm forgotten now?<br />- Hi, Uncle Paulie.
344480 347278 - Dad, how do you feel?<br />- A few new dents. How's school?
347400 348992 l made the honour roll.
349120 353352 Hi. Airport Security. Welcome home.<br />There's a press reception inside.
354800 357553 Rocky, how did you feel<br />about the Russian people?
357680 360148 You know, very good.<br />They was great people.
360280 364637 l didn't understand what they said<br />all the time, but l knew what they meant.
364760 366910 Mrs Balboa, did you learn any Russian?
367040 370794 - Did l learn Russian?<br />- Yeah, she got fluent in vodka.
371960 374918 Rocky, there are rumours<br />of physical complications.
375040 378157 - Complications?<br />- No, those were rumours.
378280 381158 He's in perfect physical condition.
382640 387760 Rocky, the American Medical Association<br />has recommended that boxing be banned.
387880 390075 - Yeah.<br />- Do you agree with the doctors?
390200 393988 Yeah, absolutely.<br />l think that doctors should never fight.
394120 396634 That was a beautiful answer, champ.
396760 401356 Doctors should stay out of the ring.<br />Doctors should never fight.
401480 404199 Rocky Balboa,<br />the funniest champion ever.
404320 406880 America's own Rocky Balboa!<br />How are ya?
407000 409833 George Washington Duke,<br />promoter <i>extraordinaire,</i>
410120 414910 welcomes Rocky Balboa, champion<br />of all the Americas and all of the Russias.
415040 417713 l would like to digress<br />from the questions a bit
417840 420035 and pose a proposition to the media.
420560 424473 Everyone in this city and in the<br />world of sports knows my reputation
424600 428878 for promoting some of the finest<br />extravaganzas in this country.
429000 434120 Well now, with the press present,<br />l'd like to ask you, Rocky Balboa,
434240 438631 to be the flamboyant, rambunctious<br />sportsman we know you can be.
438760 442036 Give this man, Union Cane,<br />a chance to challenge you
442160 444276 for the heavyweight championship.
444400 447949 Balboa, l want the opportunity<br />to take what you got.
448080 451959 lsn't it bad timing to challenge, Duke?<br />The man just got off the plane.
452080 454958 Timing is the essence of life,<br />gentlemen and ladies.
455080 458595 Now what l have on this paper<br />is the largest guarantee
458720 461598 ever offered to a champion on this planet.
461720 466669 l'm talking about a fantastic international<br />extravaganza, to be held in Japan,
466800 469712 called Lettin' lt Go ln Tokyo.
470400 475315 lt's incredible. Only in America do people<br />like us rise from oppression and poverty
475440 478398 to join hands in this international event.
478520 481671 - Excuse me.<br />- Only in America!
481800 484598 Excuse me. My husband is retired.
484720 487154 He has nothing more to prove.
487280 489271 Wait a minute! Hey, Rocky...
489400 494030 Don't you consider this a public<br />responsibility to respond now?
494160 497391 - Respond to the people.<br />- lsn't this about professionalism?
497520 501115 - To talk about it now, not later.<br />- Do you mind if l heal first?
501240 505153 - You got nothin' like what l got for you.<br />- What the hell does this all mean?
505280 509319 - That isn't enough. We gotta know now.<br />- Gotta think about that. So anyway,
509440 513638 l wanna tell everybody that<br />the flight over was really nice.
514600 517876 - Come on, guys. We need more.<br />- Adrian, if you weren't with me,
518000 521276 l never woulda done as good.<br />You're always there.
521400 526235 And my kid, having you is<br />like being born all over again.
526360 528635 Come on. Are you gonna retire or not?
528760 533151 - Anyway, excuse me. l'd like to go home.<br />- Give us something to write.
533280 537159 - Thanks very much. l appreciate it.<br />- No!
540080 542992 Don't worry. We'll get him.
563560 565949 No, really. lt's great.
568760 574312 Look at this place! l swear l ain't never<br />leavin' this place again, you know that?
574440 578877 Hey, would you like to dance? How about<br />a homecoming dance for your old man?
579000 582276 - No, don't be silly. lt's cold.<br />- l'll warm you up, young lady.
582400 585517 Have a dance. Hurry up.<br />The music's almost over.
587080 589275 - Do you like the song?<br />- You should rest.
589400 591436 - Yeah, l know.<br />- l'm tired. Come on.
591560 595155 Maybe l'll take you upstairs and<br />violate you like a parkin' meter.
595280 597874 - Cost you a quarter.<br />- Yo, Adrian!
598000 600753 Where'd you learn to talk dirty like that?
602640 606713 Uncle Paulie,<br />you notice something strange about Dad?
606840 609035 He just took a few hard shots.
609160 612357 l think you tell<br />better jokes than me, Adrian.
616720 620110 Did l hear somebody<br />call for their old man? Did you do this?
620240 621912 Sleep time, kid, OK?
622040 625476 Dad, did you know your bones<br />grow three times as fast at night?
625600 628956 No, l didn't, but l heard<br />somethin' like that. ls that me?
629080 631116 - Oh yeah, that's you.<br />- Excellent!
631240 634232 - ls that me? When we was fishin', right?<br />- Yeah.
634360 636590 That's beautiful! Look at the tent.
636720 639871 You know,<br />the fish was a lot bigger, if l recall.
640800 643109 Actually, that was a lot smaller.
643600 647559 Anyway, come on. Hit the bed.<br />lt's time for you to get healthy.
647680 650672 This is great.<br />l don't know where you learned this.
650800 654395 lt is something how this thing<br />comes out of your fingers and...
654520 656476 Oh my God.
661040 662996 Who's this?
663880 666952 lt's Madame Dupont, my French teacher.
667560 669516 Really?
671760 673671 Yeah. She looks French, sure.
673800 678749 l wouldn't show this to your mother, cos<br />she don't understand French too good.
678880 681599 God. Better cover that one up.
681720 684109 Well, champ, it's bedtime.
684240 686993 Hey, you know what?<br />l know some French talk.
687120 689156 - Knock, knock.<br />- Who's there?
689280 691555 - Madame.<br />- Madame who?
691680 694558 - Ma damn foot's caught in the door!<br />- That's an old joke.
694680 697194 What do you want from me? l'm trying.
697320 700198 l don't know all the good things,<br />you know?
700320 702834 - What's this?<br />- What?
703560 707872 Look what l found in your ear.<br />Russian money. Money ears!
708320 711232 All right. Anyway, listen.<br />You gotta get some sleep.
711360 715751 Dad? Today, when you said<br />having me was like being born again...
715880 718314 - Yeah?<br />- What did you mean?
718440 721273 Well, you know, you come up like l did
721400 727350 and you got, like, three square meals<br />of zero a day, know what l mean?
727480 729675 You got the A-side of life and the B-side.
729800 733349 l'm on the B-side, but you...<br />you got all the breaks.
733480 737632 So when l see you having<br />all these things that l didn't have,
737760 740638 l, like, live through your eyes.
740760 745151 l enjoy it a little bit.<br />lt's like having it all over again.
745280 747271 That's nice.
747400 751393 Hey, look in my face.<br />Do l look like a raccoon?
752120 754236 - A little bit.<br />- Like Rocky Raccoon?
754360 755952 - Yeah, a little bit.<br />- Nah!
756080 757911 - Yeah, you do a little.<br />- Really?
758040 762591 Hey, if you think l look bad,<br />you oughta see the other guy's knuckles.
763640 766154 Anyway, yo. Good night.
766280 768236 - OK, kid?<br />- Night.
769720 771438 - Dad?<br />- Yo?
772520 776035 - Glad you're home.<br />- Thanks. l appreciate it.
776680 780593 We'll play tomorrow, OK? Maybe<br />you can show me your English teacher.
780720 783154 - She's pretty hot, too.<br />- Nah!
783680 785318 Good night, kid.
785440 787670 You deserve the worst for what you did.
787800 790678 - That was Rocky's money.<br />- You wanna be hysterical?
790800 793553 - You cost us everything.<br />- lt was a mistake.
793680 796194 You think l thought<br />this was gonna happen?
796320 800916 Don't you walk away from me.<br />You just gave up our life!
801040 803235 And you think it's some stupid thing?
803360 807239 Paulie, do you know what you did?<br />Do you know how serious it is?
807360 811751 l understand it!<br />l understand the whole freakin' thing!
811880 815111 l understand it.<br />Your accountant's a crook, not me!
815240 817993 l did what l thought was right.<br />Don't blame me.
818120 820475 l want to murder the bum<br />worse than anybody.
820600 822556 Adrian, what's wrong?
822680 825240 Look what you done now.<br />She's dumpin' it all on me.
825360 828238 - Come on, don't turn this around on me.<br />- What did you do?
828360 831716 He gave power of attorney<br />to our accountant.
832640 835438 l just didn't gave anything to nobody.
835560 838916 He sent a letter. He says<br />''We'll be in Russia a couple of months
839040 841429 and l need Rocky to sign a tax extension.''
841560 845109 That extension was<br />a power of attorney, Paulie!
845240 848118 He's the thief! l need alcohol.
848240 851835 Rocky, on my eyes,<br />l never stole a freakin' dime.
851960 854474 Adrian, what's happenin' here?
854600 856556 - lt's gone.<br />- What's gone?
856680 860673 The money. The money.<br />Everything. lt's all gone.
860880 865078 The piece of paper Paulie had you sign<br />wasn't a request for a tax extension.
865200 869079 lt was a blanket power of attorney<br />in favour of the accountant,
869200 871953 who was involved in<br />some high-priced real estate.
872080 876073 He thought he could have your money<br />back before you knew it was gone.
876200 878919 Unfortunately for you<br />and everybody in this room,
879040 883158 his deals fell through because the<br />market dried up. And you lost millions.
883280 887353 - Ain't there nothin' l can do?<br />- l've filed eight criminal acts against him.
887480 890153 But you've got debt payment<br />on this property,
890280 894478 he didn't pay your tax returns and your<br />mortgage hasn't been paid in months.
894600 897876 We didn't have a mortgage.<br />Our house was fully paid for.
898000 902949 - Don't take it from me. Ask him.<br />- There's nearly $400,000 outstanding.
903080 906709 The only thing that is not encumbered<br />is a gym, willed to your son
906840 909752 by a Mickey Goldmill in 1 982.
909880 912917 You can sell things.<br />Remember those commercials you did?
913040 916476 l ain't no commercial kinda guy.<br />l'm a fighter. That's what l do.
916600 920752 No, we couldn't get sponsors.<br />With the investigation of the accountant,
920880 924429 out pops a criminal record<br />of Rocky's for assault.
924560 926949 But that was a long time ago.<br />He didn't know...
927080 931153 Why not a couple more fights? With<br />your popularity, you'd be out in no time.
931280 933794 - He's retiring.<br />- Rocko, fighting's the ticket.
933920 937435 l said he's retired!<br />Paulie, we're here because of you.
937560 941872 l'm not taking the heat for all this.<br />l thought l was doing smart business.
942000 947279 - You thought you did smart business?<br />- Hey! The accountant was your choice.
947400 952155 You shoulda known he was a thief, but in<br />your fairy-tale world the air don't move.
952280 954953 - You're like a season that don't change.<br />- Hey, enough.
955080 957992 l'm not no tomato can you kick around.
958120 962193 You call Duke. Tell him l'll fight Cane.<br />l don't care. Anywhere, any time.
962320 965630 - No. Rocky, no!<br />- lf that's what you want, l'll get on it.
965760 969036 - Rocky, please.<br />- A couple of fights, we're outta trouble.
969160 971833 - Yeah, but you said...<br />- No, l didn't say anything.
971960 974952 - Did we come this far to lose it?<br />- You have to see a doctor.
975080 980029 - l don't need a doctor. l need a promoter.<br />- lf the doctor says OK, l'll support you.
980160 983516 l gotta fight, OK?<br />l got problems. l gotta fight.
983640 985596 Will you do it for me?
987520 989033 All right. For you.
989920 992593 Because of continuous<br />violent blows to the head,
992720 997157 you have a condition particular to boxers<br />called <i>cavum septum peIIucidum,</i>
997280 1000431 which is a hole in the membrane<br />separating the ventricles.
1000560 1004235 The brain surface neurons in this area<br />have also been traumatised.
1004360 1009753 Simply stated, Mr Balboa, it means that<br />you have suffered damage to the brain.
1009880 1011836 How long until he recovers?
1011960 1014110 The effects are irreversible.
1016000 1018195 Rocky, you have to retire.
1018320 1023519 l don't wanna retire. This ain't the time<br />to retire. Not in here, not in no office.
1024440 1029275 l just fought the best fight of my life.<br />l just did that, you know?
1029400 1034155 - And all l need is a couple more.<br />- No. You suffered severe brain trauma.
1034280 1036840 He could be wrong.<br />Anybody could be wrong.
1036960 1039349 He ain't God.<br />Adrian, only God ain't wrong.
1039480 1043155 - Rocky, this is what's good for you.<br />- l only need a couple of easy ones.
1043280 1047910 Not the way it is. You can't get licensed<br />in any State. He can't, can he, Doctor?
1048040 1051749 - That is correct.<br />- Rocky, do you love me?
1054160 1058597 - Yeah, l love you. Why do you ask that?<br />- Because if you love somebody,
1058720 1062679 you live with them, you live for them.<br />You don't gamble with a life.
1062800 1066475 Rocky, l don't care<br />about the money. lt's you.
1066600 1068556 That's all that matters.
1069800 1073918 Please. We'll be OK. We'll be fine.
1084040 1088795 - No one has to know, Doctor, right?<br />- lt'll be strictly confidential.
1092320 1094276 Thank you.

1382040 1386079 Apollo won't know what hit him.<br />You'll roll over him like a bulldozer.
1386200 1388156 An ltalian bulldozer.
1388280 1392159 You know, kid, l know how you feel<br />about this fight that's comin' up.

1398280 1400635 Why, if you wasn't here,
1400760 1403957 l probably wouldn't be alive today.
1404080 1408631 The fact that you're here and doing<br />as well as you're doing gives me...
1408760 1412992 What do you call it?<br />A motivisation to stay alive.
1413120 1417432 <i>Cos I think that peopIe die sometimes</i><br /><i>when they don't wanna Iive no more.</i>
1417560 1419596 Nature's smarter than people think.

1424120 1428830 we lose everything and we keep<br />losing and losing, till we say:
1428960 1433351 ''What the hell am l living around<br />here for? l got no reason to go on.''
1434400 1436755 But with you, kid...
1436880 1439110 Boy, l got a reason to go on.
1439560 1443678 <i>And I'm gonna stay aIive.</i><br /><i>And I wiII watch you make good.</i>
1443800 1448078 - And l'll never leave you.<br />- l'll never leave you until that happens.
1448200 1452796 Cos when l leave you,<br />you'll not only know how to fight,
1452920 1456959 you'll be able to take care of yourself<br />outside the ring, too. ls that OK?
1457080 1459674 <i>- It's OK.</i><br /><i>- OK.</i>

1472600 1475717 And Rocky Marciano give me that.
1475840 1478559 You know what it was? His cuff link.
1479600 1482592 And now l'm giving it to you.
1482720 1485632 <i>And it's gonna be Iike...</i>
1485760 1489275 Like an angel on your shoulder to you.
1489400 1494599 And if you ever get hurt and<br />you feel that you're goin' down,
1494720 1497678 this little angel<br />is gonna whisper in your ear.
1497800 1501156 He's gonna say<br />''Get up, you son of a bitch!''
1502760 1505035 ''Cos Mickey loves you.''
1505160 1507515 <i>OK?</i>
1507640 1510438 Thanks, Mick. l love you, too.
1510560 1512994 Jesus. Go after him, kid.
1514320 1516436 - Go after him.<br />- Thanks.
1520520 1523034 You was the angel.
1523160 1526118 - There it is.<br />- What happened to his other cuff link?
1526240 1528879 l don't know. He only give me one.
1529000 1531150 He gave it to some bum.
1577920 1580718 Careful. Don't worry about these.
1580840 1583035 All right, let's go, Paulie.
1583160 1586869 l really can't believe it.<br />This kid's taking this too good.
1587000 1591198 Hey, Rock, it's good l kept<br />the place, right? lt saves money.
1591320 1592673 Get back.

1666680 1668875 When'd you start that?
1669000 1672629 l don't know. lt's like a bad habit<br />that comes back. But, hey!
1672760 1675718 We ain't talkin' about me.<br />We're talkin' about you.
1675840 1677796 Hey, Rocky, how you doin', man?

1680520 1684149 You're smart in school,<br />but you gotta be smart on the street, too.
1684280 1687033 - How do you mean?<br />- You gotta know who the players are
1687160 1691392 - and who you're talkin' to.<br />- Watch out for scams. Everyone scams.
1691520 1693750 - What's a scam?<br />- Ask your father.
1694240 1696879 - A scam is like a hustle.<br />- He don't get it.
1697000 1699673 - Well, a hustle's related to...<br />- Rocky!
1699800 1702155 - Remember me? l'm Bubba's mother.<br />- Oh, yeah.
1702280 1706239 - You used his head for a punchin' bag.<br />- Yeah, he had a nice head.
1707360 1710796 - Anyway, a hustle's related to a con.<br />- He don't get it.
1710920 1714071 A deception?<br />You're saying beware of deceptions.
1714200 1718079 Yeah, that's good. Absolutely.<br />You're very smart, you know?
1719560 1722120 Ain't this where<br />the Atomic Hoagy shop used to be?
1722240 1724117 l'm new here, Dad.
1724240 1728313 - This neighbourhood's got tooth decay.<br />- lt's called urban blight.
1729440 1732750 l'll tell you somethin',<br />this place is blightin' everywhere.
1732880 1737112 A little aluminum siding and paint, this<br />place could be OK. What do you think?
1737240 1742598 Anyway, we're late for school.<br />Paulie, l wanna talk to the kid private like.
1742720 1744676 - Like l got no feelings.<br />- Oh, come on.
1744800 1747553 - That's how wars start.<br />- Relax, would you?
1747680 1751593 - So anyway, everybody's got an angle.<br />- Tough break, Rock.
1751720 1756919 Everybody's got a hustle. These kids have<br />got street brains. That's how they live.
1757040 1761511 These kids ain't like no personalities<br />that you've grown up with.
1761640 1765155 - So you gotta stay very sharp round here.<br />- l intend to.
1765280 1769831 lntend! You know, sometimes<br />you make me feel very stupid.
1769960 1773350 - Why?<br />- Why? Cos you're smarter than me.
1773480 1774913 - No, l'm not.<br />- Yeah, you are.
1775040 1778874 lt's like every day you learn somethin'<br />new and l forget somethin' new.
1779000 1781719 But hey, listen.<br />We're in this thing together.
1781840 1785469 lf you can figure out how to fix<br />things up, don't be afraid to tell me.
1785600 1788478 We gotta stick together, cos what are we?
1788600 1790955 - What?<br />- What are we?
1792240 1795118 - Oh, home team.<br />- Home team! You've got that right.
1795240 1800917 l used to go to this school when l was<br />a kid. Nice bricks. lt was real tough then.
1801040 1804237 But l think you can handle it,<br />don't you think?
1806640 1809438 lf you went here, l can go here.
1809560 1811915 l'm not scared really.
1812040 1813871 Really?
1814000 1816309 Well, l guess l'm a little scared.
1816440 1819830 - But that's normal, don't you think?<br />- Oh, yeah. l had 72 fights...
1819960 1825114 ..and every one of 'em l was scared, so<br />yeah, you know, that's real, real normal.
1827800 1831236 - l'll see you later.<br />- OK, kid. Here's the front door.
1833280 1835271 Hey, wait. What's this?
1836680 1839114 Goodness gracious.<br />Where'd this come from?
1839240 1842437 lt's a strange place to stash<br />your lunch money.
1842560 1844437 lt's just a lunch joke, you know?
1844560 1848155 - Thanks, Dad.<br />- OK, then, l'll see you later.
1848280 1851670 Remember, Daddy loves you.<br />You're number one. Home team.
1851800 1854155 Just be nice, right? You'll be OK.
1855040 1859989 And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend.<br />They don't like that around here.
1865880 1868030 You know, l'm really<br />worried about the kid.
1868160 1871470 He ain't used to livin' like this.<br />He don't know the streets.
1871600 1873875 At school, l know what's gonna happen.
1874000 1878835 Some wise guy's gonna come up to him<br />cos he's my kid and try to bang him out.
1878960 1881793 Give him a cheap shot, you know?<br />l mean, jeez...
1881920 1885515 - Mr Balboa, my name's Tommy Gunn.<br />- Yeah? How you doin'?
1885640 1887756 With that name, you better be tough.
1887880 1892351 lt ain't easy. Anyway, l'm from Oklahoma.<br />My amateur record is 45 to one.
1892480 1896155 - l turned pro at 18 and l had eight fights.<br />- You're a fighter?
1896280 1899317 And now that l'm 20,<br />l'd just like to show you what l got.
1899440 1903115 - l've saved up about 400 bucks...<br />- Mr Rocky Balboa!
1903240 1907552 Excuse me, l have some business here.<br />Good to see you again, friend.
1907680 1910877 - How you doin'?<br />- My health is fine. What more can l ask?
1911000 1914515 - Listen, l gotta go to work now.<br />- What, here? ln a sweatbox?
1914640 1917871 - Can't be good for the image.<br />- Urban light. What can you do?
1918000 1920594 What'd you say? lt's blight. Urban blight.
1920720 1924838 George wants you to consider wearing<br />gloves again. lt's a helluva payday.
1924960 1927633 - l'm officially expired.<br />- You have marquee value.
1927760 1933278 You put asses into seats. A businessman<br />don't retire if he can still pull in the bread.
1933400 1937632 - Only America gives these opportunities.<br />- Union Cane's going for the title.
1937760 1940832 Here's some tickets.<br />We've a strong feeling about this.
1940960 1944919 - lf he takes it, that's the time to challenge.<br />- People love comebacks.
1945040 1948430 There's nothing more commercial<br />than a long-shot comeback
1948560 1950835 of a down-on-his-luck underdog.
1950960 1954953 As Mark Twain said: ''Virtue has<br />never been as respectable as money.''
1955080 1956672 - Who's Twain?<br />- A painter.
1956800 1958836 You're the Great White Hope.
1958960 1961679 You mean Great White Dope. No, forget it.
1961800 1965952 Hold the bullshit. l know the problem.<br />You think l was born yesterday?
1966080 1971074 Merlin, show him the paper. This is your<br />medical report. We can work around it.
1971200 1973430 - Where'd you get this?<br />- lt doesn't matter.
1973560 1976791 lf you fight Cane, George can<br />guarantee to get you a license.
1976920 1978512 - Guaranteed.<br />- You can do this?
1978640 1981234 - No problem.<br />- This comeback's in the bag.
1981360 1985512 - The time's hot. The deal's hot. <i>CaIiente!</i><br />- We could use one more payday.
1985640 1990077 - Adrian, where'd you come from?<br />- Mrs Balboa just appeared! She's magic.
1990200 1993636 l don't think you're funny.<br />Are you talking him into fighting?
1993760 1997070 Talking business, darlin'.<br />Do you like feelin' hard up?
1997200 2001557 Do you like reachin' in your pocket<br />and only feelin' your leg? l didn't think so.
2001680 2004956 l'm offering you the opportunity<br />to dump this loser image.
2005080 2008197 - Who are you talking to?<br />- You ain't workin' across...
2008320 2012279 What the hell are you talkin' about?<br />This is a tremendous opportunity.
2012400 2016154 Opportunity for who? For you to<br />make money? For him to be disabled?
2016280 2018953 What would you do<br />if the choices were reversed?
2019080 2021071 You have to think about that.
2021200 2023919 Rocky, they don't care about you.
2024520 2028354 Let's get serious. You represent<br />the dreams of the long shots.
2028480 2032792 The little people identify with you.<br />That is the key to public success.
2032920 2037391 You a true champion, a true product of<br />the people. Sell it while they'll still buy.
2037520 2041274 That ain't gonna last forever.<br />You say you a fighter, then fight!
2041400 2045632 And l'll make you so much money you<br />can swim in it. You can swim, can't you?
2045760 2048957 Whaddaya say?<br />Put some hustle behind this muscle.
2049080 2051674 He's done. He's done fighting!
2058600 2060750 You are a damn fool.
2062360 2065193 Maybe we oughta sign<br />Mrs Balboa to fight Cane, huh?
2065320 2069199 Looks like she's the one<br />with the <i>cojones</i> in the family.
2070600 2073194 You don't talk like that in front of my wife.
2073800 2075756 That ain't no park bench, boy.
2079480 2083519 - l'll get him.<br />- Rocky, l'm really sorry. l didn't wanna...
2083640 2086154 You guys want privacy? l'll be upstairs.
2090000 2092275 Rocky.
2092400 2094516 Rocky, l'm sorry. l...
2094640 2097871 But it just takes one bad hit<br />and you could be an invalid.
2098000 2102676 l feel like an invalid already. Why'd you<br />come back? You're too smart for this.
2102800 2106076 l got nothing to do. l called Gloria.
2106200 2110239 - She said she could use part-time help.<br />- But why do you wanna do this?
2110360 2114239 Why go back to where you started?<br />l gotta do it, but you don't gotta do it!
2114360 2117716 l wanted to be there<br />so l could be close to you.
2126760 2129718 All right, yeah.<br />You know, it's gettin' cold out here.
2129840 2132991 Maybe we better get inside, OK?<br />l understand.
2133120 2134872 - Are you all right?<br />- What?
2135000 2137639 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah, l'm all right. l'm fine.
2137760 2139910 Adrian, it's gettin' cold, OK?
2145480 2149075 Yo, Adrian! Did we ever leave this place?
2151760 2153716 l don't know.
2158680 2161274 Hey, mind if l talk to you now?
2161400 2163960 My head's a little busy right now.
2175200 2177555 You won't get him.<br />Balboa don't think straight.
2177680 2181593 - None of these bums do. l need an angle.<br />- l'll fight Balboa right now.
2181920 2184957 - l'm better than Balboa ever was.<br />- Hey!
2186000 2188798 l own the paper on you.<br />You will fight who l tell you,
2188920 2192196 where l tell you and how l tell you.<br />You got that?
2193240 2196152 Don't aggravate<br />the hand that feeds you, huh?
2199400 2201960 None of these bums think straight.
2205600 2207272 All l need is a hook.
2218440 2221000 Hey! Ain't you Rocky's kid?
2221120 2224317 - Yeah! You Rocky's kid, right?<br />- Yeah. How're you doing?
2224440 2226431 l've seen your picture in the paper.
2226560 2229757 - You know what? Your old man's a punk.<br />- What?
2231120 2233793 - Get off me!<br />- What are you wearing my coat for?
2233920 2236388 - Just leave him alone!<br />- You wanna beatin' too?
2236520 2239671 - Gimme my coat! l'm not kiddin' around.<br />- No way.

2258000 2261356 This is the cup Rocky drinks out of<br />around the house. Ten bucks.
2261480 2264790 - How l know it's the real thing?<br />- Look at the lip marks.

2311080 2313833 - Yo, Rock, we're ready.<br />- Wonderful.
2315280 2317999 Hey, kid. You got the headgear?
2318120 2320076 Nah, l don't need one.
2321520 2324159 He's gonna get his <i>cojones</i> knocked out.
2324280 2325952 OK. Ready, guys?
2326080 2329311 - Benson, go easy, all right?<br />- Sure. OK, Rocky.
2329440 2331510 Time!

2337320 2340278 - Hey, kid! What's his name again?<br />- Tommy Gunn.
2340400 2343233 Tommy, whoa! lt ain't no law to duck.
2344400 2346356 Go side to side. That's it.
2349440 2354309 - Hey, man, take it easy.<br />- Come on, lighten up. lt's called sparring.
2355280 2357510 Hey! OK. Hey, kid.
2357640 2359835 Hey, lighten up! Time out!
2359960 2362793 Smell that, Rocko?<br />The odour of opportunity.
2362920 2365593 Hey, that's it.<br />What did l tell you? Time!
2365720 2367711 Hey, that's it. Time!
2370000 2373390 Hey, back off. That's enough!<br />What's the matter with you?
2373520 2377229 - Tommy, are you crazy or something?<br />- What's the matter with you, man?
2377360 2380113 - l'm sorry.<br />- Go cool off, kid. Sorry about this.
2380240 2382629 He stinks of opportunity, Rocko.
2382760 2385957 Hey, look,<br />goin' easy don't mean breakin' bones.
2386080 2390039 - l'm sorry. But what do you think?<br />- What do l think? l don't think you listen.
2390400 2393119 But you brawl<br />like you was a street fighter.
2393240 2396869 l know somethin' about that,<br />but this is boxing. lt ain't mugging.
2397000 2401869 - l'm sorry, but l know l can do it all.<br />- Yeah? Well, not on this date, OK?
2402000 2405470 - That's it?<br />- l gotta work with these kids here.
2406160 2408116 How about you tryin' to manage me?
2408240 2409434 - Manage?<br />- Yeah.
2409560 2412358 Unless you think l ain't got nothin' goin'.
2412480 2413879 Nothin' goin'?
2414000 2419154 Yeah, all right, you got a lot goin'. You got<br />a lot of tools. But l ain't no manager.
2419280 2422078 The gentleman that owned<br />this place was a manager.
2422200 2425590 But me, l was always the managed... guy.
2426800 2429155 Hey, look. Good luck, all right?
2431560 2433869 All right, guys. Let's go.
2434000 2435956 Come on. Move around.
2437080 2439036 That's it. Nice.
2451200 2454476 All right, you guys, come on.<br />No cheap shots. Move it around.
2461680 2463750 How you doing?
2463880 2466235 Cold? You look cold.
2467360 2471319 l guess it has something<br />to do with the weather.
2471440 2473715 Here. Take my coat.
2473840 2476593 No, thanks. Where's your boyfriend?
2477520 2480478 Him? Forget it. He ain't got no manners.
2482080 2484435 l'm Jewel, if you wanna know.
2486040 2488076 l'm Robert.
2488200 2489758 Hi.
2490520 2496072 Well, l been living here about<br />six years now. lt ain't Disneyland!
2496200 2498839 - You been to Disneyland?<br />- Sure.
2498960 2501554 You make it sound like everybody has.
2501680 2506800 l know you can't tell by the way l look,<br />but l ain't like the other kids around here.
2506920 2509673 Why? l mean,<br />what makes you so different?
2509800 2514237 l don't know. l guess it's cos<br />l wanna get out. You know how it is.
2515520 2519513 You know, for an ltalian kid,<br />you ain't got a bad butt.
2528680 2532150 - First money l get, l'm goin' to Miami.<br />- Why Miami?
2532280 2536592 - Miami needs new gigolos.<br />- Yeah, l read somethin' like that.
2539320 2542676 My back is getting bad.<br />How come <i>you</i> don't have arthritis?
2542800 2545473 Ain't l got enough?
2545600 2548433 Adrian's too good for this.
2548560 2550676 This place really depresses me, Paul.
2550800 2553872 Yo! Rock. Come inside.<br />Everybody's been askin' for ya.
2554000 2557117 - No, thanks. l'm a little beat.<br />- Hey, l'm a little thirsty.
2557240 2558992 - You go if you wanna.<br />- Mr Balboa?
2559120 2562590 - Look at this. Tommy Gunn.<br />- Why are you still hanging around?
2562720 2567271 - ls there something l can do for you?<br />- Yeah. l'd like to try again.
2567400 2571234 Kid, l'd like to help, but l really<br />don't know nothin' about managin'.
2571360 2576036 Man, all l'm askin' for is a chance.<br />lf l screw up, then hell, l'll leave.
2576160 2580119 - What have you got to lose?<br />- Me? Nothin'. lt's what <i>you</i> got to lose.
2580240 2582196 - l got nothin' to lose.<br />- Maybe you do.
2582320 2585995 What if l don't do good, right?<br />And you don't make it?
2586120 2589271 l don't want you blaming me for this,<br />kid, you know?
2589400 2593678 Here's what l would do if l was you.<br />Listen to me. lf l was you,
2593800 2598191 l would go home and talk to your family<br />people. Come up with somethin' better.
2598320 2601517 l got no family people.<br />All l got is what you see here.
2601640 2605269 l know all about you, back from<br />your first fight with Apollo Creed.
2605400 2608153 l read about how no one<br />ever gave you a chance.
2608280 2611955 l'm not from the same streets as you,<br />but l'm hungry, like you were.
2612080 2614389 Ever since l put on gloves<br />l've wanted to meet you.
2614520 2618672 Cos l knew that if anybody could<br />make me a winner, it was you.
2618800 2621598 Hey, Paulie,<br />you see a winner standing here?
2621720 2625156 Yes! Man, you beat the best.<br />Nobody could ever say different.
2625280 2629193 Look, Rocky, you don't know me,<br />but anything you want me to do, l'll do.
2629320 2631550 And if l can't, l'll bust my butt tryin'.
2631680 2637676 l'm not hustlin' you, man. All l'm askin'<br />for is a chance. l mean, just one shot.
2647160 2649310 Are you hungry?
2650560 2651993 Yeah.
2652120 2654953 Yeah? Come on.
2655080 2657799 You're really gonna like<br />the way Adrian cooks.
2657920 2661674 She does amazing things with macaroni,<br />especially tomatoes.
2661800 2665952 But l gotta warn you,<br />she can be a little vicious with the garlic!
2667560 2671917 - So why'd this kid smack your face?<br />- lt really doesn't matter, Dad.
2672040 2675237 - lt does matter. They took his coat.<br />- l don't want the coat.
2675360 2677316 They took the one with the collar?
2677440 2680079 - l'll go to your school and...<br />- You'll make it worse.
2680200 2683351 - Can't l do what l think is right?<br />- What do you think is right?
2683480 2686233 - A baseball bat across the face.<br />- Paulie!
2686360 2688669 - Adrian, can l have the plate?<br />- Yes, Rocky.
2688800 2691314 l had trouble like that<br />when l was in school.
2691440 2695228 Every day l got chased by this kid,<br />till one day my mother said to me:
2695360 2698238 - ''Pretend the guy's like a balloon.''<br />- Balloon?
2698360 2702239 She said if you pop 'em hard,<br />these guys just go away.
2703600 2707388 Tommy, we're trying to raise our son<br />so he can handle his problems
2707520 2710080 with his mind, not his muscles.
2710200 2712236 - Sorry.<br />- That's why l'll get mangled.
2712360 2715955 - You ain't gonna get mangled.<br />- Dad, will you teach me how to fight?
2716080 2717718 A baseball bat would be nice.
2717840 2720673 Do you wanna grow up<br />and just use your fists?
2720800 2723075 Adrian, l don't think it'd be so bad
2723200 2727113 if l taught him how to throw a few...<br />deadly punches.
2727240 2729674 Tommy, did your dad teach you to fight?
2729800 2733395 - No, not exactly. l had to...<br />- Sweetheart, don't get personal.
2733520 2737149 No, it's OK. You see, my old man,<br />he used to drink a lot. Seriously.
2737280 2741512 He'd go out with his friends, then<br />he'd come home, look to punch on me.
2741640 2745189 He'd punch on my mother, too.<br />He did that a lot of times.
2745320 2748551 So growing up,<br />l only thought about fightin' my father.
2748680 2751592 You know, when l was 1 3,<br />l got in trouble at school.
2751720 2755076 He tied me down and whipped me<br />so bad l couldn't walk for a week.
2755200 2757668 l couldn't do anything.
2757800 2763318 The first guy l ever knocked out was my<br />father. ln the ring, it's like all l see is him.
2764080 2765991 That's kinda sick, huh?
2766920 2770708 Yo, Tommy, at least you had<br />an old man to knock out, you know?
2772640 2774596 Yeah.
2775720 2778996 - l didn't even have that.<br />- Some day you can punch out <i>your</i> pop.
2779120 2784513 - Paulie, what you telling him that for?<br />- lt's the fittest of the survival.
2784640 2790158 - Tommy, where you stayin' tonight?<br />- Oh, l'll find some place to stay.
2790280 2793989 No, l tell you what.<br />We got room down in the basement.
2794120 2796554 - What about me?<br />- Your son is sleeping there.
2796680 2800798 - Well, he can stay with his uncle.<br />- What am l, a pit stop?
2800920 2804037 l don't wanna cause any problems.<br />l can find a place to stay.
2804160 2808199 No, it's OK.<br />lt's just for a little while, you know.
2808320 2812677 Right? No problem at all. Hey, kid.<br />l appreciate it. lt's cold outside.
2812800 2817396 - l'm not changing no sheets.<br />- Hey, since when have you ever?
2817520 2821229 Tommy, why don't you come on down?<br />We'll show you the whole place.
2821360 2826388 Why don't you go downstairs and<br />show your father what you did today?
2829800 2832951 Hey, Junior!<br />Your plumbing don't leak, do it?
2839560 2842279 - You know this guy?<br />- Yeah. He hits hard.
2844960 2848111 - Adrian can really cook!<br />- Yeah, she's OK. Listen, Tommy.
2848240 2851755 We ain't had a chance<br />to get this place too nice.
2851880 2855111 We'll get it together in a while, you know?
2855240 2858198 - Wow! Man, this is what it's about.<br />- Holy mackerel!
2858320 2860959 Why do you keep this stuff down here?
2861080 2865119 When did you get a chance to do this?<br />He took it all out of a box. lt's beautiful.
2865240 2868755 You painted... When did you<br />get a chance to do this, kid?
2868880 2872475 - After school. lt's no big deal.<br />- Where'd you get the glove?
2872600 2876275 Oh, this? Thanks.<br />This is one of my favourite objects.
2876400 2880791 Mickey give me this before he departed.<br />lt was Rocky Marciano's cuff link.
2880920 2884595 - Really? The real Rocky Marciano?<br />- You got me thinkin' about Mickey.
2884720 2887951 l wanna show you something.<br />He told me a long time ago...
2888080 2893313 He says that fighting<br />is like 90% in the skull
2893440 2895874 and 10% in the body.<br />This is what he says to me.
2896000 2899834 - Dad, l met this really nice girl today.<br />- Really? That's wonderful.
2899960 2903669 - She's a lot better than...<br />- Wait a minute. Don't change the station.
2903800 2906951 l'll be right back.<br />l just wanna tell Tommy a few things.
2907080 2910675 Hey, who was your best friend<br />back in Orlando?
2910800 2913872 - That's Oklahoma.<br />- Well, yeah.
2914000 2916275 - Eric Elder.<br />- No, no.
2916400 2918868 Your best friend is<br />a guy named Frankie Fear.
2919000 2923437 You see, fear is a fighter's best friend.<br />lt ain't nothin' to be ashamed of.
2923560 2928395 You see, fear keeps you sharp. lt keeps<br />you awake. lt makes you wanna survive.
2928520 2931751 But the thing is,<br />you gotta learn how to control it.
2931880 2935350 Cos fear is like this fire<br />and it's burning deep inside.
2935480 2938472 Now, if you control it, Tommy,<br />it's gonna make you hot.
2938600 2941194 But, you see,<br />if this thing here controls you,
2941320 2945438 it's gonna burn you and everythin'<br />else around you up. That's right.
2945560 2948677 Anyway, these are the things<br />that was taught to me
2948800 2952156 and, if you want, l'd like to teach to you.
2952280 2954794 This mean you're gonna manage me?
2954920 2958037 - Absolutely. Hey, home team.<br />- All right!
2958160 2961357 - Let's go for it.<br />- Do you mind showin' me a few things?
2961480 2963835 Sure, Tommy. l'll show you a lot of things.
2968680 2971752 Hey, rich boy.<br />How much you got in your pocket today?
2971880 2973711 - Nothin'.<br />- Come on, let's have it.
2973840 2976479 - l got nothin'.<br />- Come on, gimme the money.
2976600 2979034 - Come on!<br />- Hey, l gotta eat.
2979160 2982118 He's hungry, he's gotta eat. Well, eat this.
2984960 2987076 l got it. Go!
2987200 2988997 <i>Father Carmine!</i>
2990640 2992278 Father Carmine!
2992400 2994755 - Maybe he's not home.<br />- Priests is always home.
2999680 3002319 l didn't wanna<br />disturb you that much, Father.
3004840 3007593 Oh, excellent. Everything is perfect.
3007720 3010029 Father, this is my new friend,<br />Tommy Gunn.
3014760 3018799 l was wondering... Tommy here's<br />a fighter and l'm his manager.
3018920 3021798 l wondered if you'd do me<br />a favour, if you ain't busy.
3021920 3026675 Could you throw us a couple blessings?<br />One, that l don't mess up as a manager.
3026800 3030270 And B, that Tommy does<br />as good as l think he can do: great.
3030400 3033278 And don't get hurt none.<br />Could you do that?
3040360 3043955 l love it when he does that.<br />Thanks, Father! Really appreciate this.
3044240 3047949 - Any time.<br />- OK. l'll see you in church.
3051440 3056389 - Hey, man, what'd you do this for?<br />- lt don't hurt havin' an angel on your side.
3060200 3062794 - Hey, Rock. How's it going?<br />- Doin' great, guys.
3062920 3064717 Slow down or you'll get a ticket!
3064840 3067991 - This is Tommy Gunn. He'll be a champ.<br />- How you doin', Tom?
3077680 3080433 All right, break it up. Break!
3092320 3094151 Get off the ropes!
3101280 3103077 - Go easy.<br />- Man, l need more work.
3103200 3105998 - No, you're ready.<br />- No, this guy's killing me.
3106120 3109112 - You're ready now. You're perfect.<br />- He's killing me.
3109240 3111879 - l feel weak.<br />- No, listen to me. Shut up!
3112000 3115470 Mick used to say the only difference<br />between a hero and a coward
3115600 3118478 is the hero's willing to go for it.<br />Take the shot.
3118600 3121319 This guy here is scared too.<br />You're both scared.
3121440 3125479 Remember in the basement we talked<br />about fear? How it was like this fire?
3125600 3129195 You gotta control it or it burns you up.<br />Or it's gonna burn him up.
3129320 3131151 Make it work for you, Tommy.
3131280 3134317 l would never do nothin'<br />to hurt you, understand?
3134440 3138672 Fear is like this fire, OK? Now let it burn<br />until it becomes like this volcano.
3138800 3142349 When you see the openin',<br />explode all over this guy, OK?
3142480 3146234 Now, you can take him, OK?<br />lt ain't all muscle, it's all heart.
3146360 3150069 Heart and fire! OK, now you do it.
3152040 3154679 Remember,<br />l'm like this angel on your shoulder.
3154800 3157872 l ain't gonna let nothin' happen to you.<br />Go for it.
3161960 3164474 Come on, Tommy. Jab!
3168800 3170756 Left, right!
3171640 3173312 The body!
