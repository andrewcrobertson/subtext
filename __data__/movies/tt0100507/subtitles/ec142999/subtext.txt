40000 41956 I must break you.
46360 49079 - Throw your right!<br /><i>- He will not let him out of there.</i>

237320 241199 - Rocky?<br />- How's everybody doin'... out there?
241320 243834 Oh! Everything's OK.
245240 247196 What's wrong?
249040 253830 - What's wrong?<br />- Remember when Mick said...
253960 256599 ...when he was fighting sometimes...
256720 262590 ...he'd fight so hard that he was thinking<br />that he broke somethin' inside?
262720 265393 He was gonna... die?
265520 271356 And that's what he said,<br />that's when the angels was pullin' on him.
271480 274756 Rocky, you're scaring me.<br />I don't... What's wrong?
274880 277440 - I can't...<br />- Can't what?
280560 283074 I can't stop my hands from shaking.
286320 289312 - I ain't never felt this thing.<br />- You better see a doctor.
289440 292159 No. I just wanna go home.
292280 294236 No. You can see a doctor.
294360 296749 I'm just tired.
296880 299314 I just wanna go home, Mick.
300120 302793 - I'm just tired. I just...<br />- OK.

334840 337195 - Dad! Dad!<br />- Oh, there he is!
337320 340198 There he is! Hey, slugger! How you doin'?
340320 342117 - Say hi to your mom.<br />- Hi, Mom.
342240 344356 - I'm forgotten now?<br />- Hi, Uncle Paulie.
344480 347278 - Dad, how you feelin'?<br />- A few new dents. How's school?
347400 348992 - I made the honour roll.<br />- Yo!
349120 353352 Hi. Airport Security. Welcome home.<br />There's a press reception inside.
354800 357553 Rocky, how did you feel<br />about the Russian people?
357680 360148 You know, very good.<br />They was great people.
360280 364637 I didn't understand them all the time,<br />but I understood what they was meaning.
364760 366910 Mrs Balboa, did you learn any Russian?
367040 370794 - Did I learn Russian?<br />- Yeah, she got fluent in vodka.
371960 374918 Rocky, there are rumours<br />of physical complications.
375040 378157 - Complications?<br />- No, those were rumours.
378280 381158 He's in perfect physical condition.
382640 387760 Rocky, the American Medical Association<br />has recommended that boxing be banned.
387880 390075 - Yeah.<br />- Do you agree with the doctors?
390200 393988 Yeah, absolutely.<br />I think that doctors should never fight.
394120 396634 That was a beautiful answer, champ!
396760 401356 Doctors should stay out of the ring.<br />Doctors should never fight.
401480 404199 Rocky Balboa,<br />the funniest champion ever!
404320 406880 America's own, Rocky Balboa!<br />How are ya?
407000 409833 George Washington Duke,<br />promoter <i>extraordinaire...</i>
410120 414910 ...welcomes Rocky Balboa, champion<br />of all the Americas and all of the Russias.
415040 417713 Now I would like to digress<br />from the questions a bit...
417840 420035 ...and pose a proposition to the media.
420560 424473 Everyone in this city and in the<br />world of sports knows my reputation...
424600 428878 ...for promoting some of the finest<br />extravaganzas in this country.
429000 434120 Well now, with the press present,<br />I'd like to ask you, Rocky Balboa...
434240 438631 ...to be the flamboyant, rambunctious<br />sportsman we know you can be.
438760 442036 Give this man, Union Cane,<br />a chance to challenge you...
442160 444276 ...for the heavyweight championship.
444400 447949 Balboa, I want the opportunity<br />to take what you got.
448080 451959 Isn't this bad timing, Duke?<br />The man just got off the plane.
452080 454958 Timing is the essence of life,<br />gentlemen and ladies.
455080 458595 Now what I have on this paper<br />is the largest guarantee...
458720 461598 ...ever offered to<br />a champion on this planet!
461720 466669 I'm talking about a fantastic international<br />extravaganza to be held in Japan...
466800 469712 ...called Lettin' It Go In Tokyo!
470400 475315 It's incredible. Only in America do people<br />like us rise from oppression and poverty...
475440 478398 ...to join hands in this international event!
478520 481671 - Excuse me!<br />- Only in America!
481800 484598 Excuse me. My husband is retired.
484720 487154 He has nothing more to prove.
487280 489271 Wait a minute! Hey, Rocky...
489400 494030 Don't you consider this a public<br />responsibility to respond now?
494160 497391 - Respond to the people.<br />- Isn't this about professionalism?
497520 501115 - To talk about it now, not later.<br />- Do you mind if I heal first?
501240 505153 - You got nothin' like what I got for you.<br />- What the hell does this all mean?
505280 509319 - That isn't enough. We gotta know now.<br />- Gotta think about that. So anyway...
509440 513638 I wanna tell everybody that<br />the flight over was... really nice.
514600 517876 - Come on, guys. We need more.<br />- Adrian, if you weren't with me...
518000 521276 ...I never woulda done as good.<br />You're always there.
521400 526235 And my kid, having you is<br />like being born all over again.
526360 528635 Come on. Are you gonna retire or not?
528760 533151 - Anyway, excuse me. I'd like to go home.<br />- Give us something to write!
533280 536556 - Thanks very much. I appreciate it.<br />- No!
540080 543390 Don't worry. We'll get him. We'll get him.
563560 565949 No, really. It's great.
566080 568640 Aaah! Yo!
568760 574312 Look at this place! I swear I ain't never<br />leavin' this place again, you know that?
574440 578877 Hey, would you like to dance? How about<br />a homecoming dance for your old man?
579000 582276 - No, don't be silly. It's cold.<br />- I'll warm you up, young lady.
582400 585517 Have a dance. Hurry up.<br />The music's almost over.
587080 589275 - Do you like the song?<br />- You should rest.
589400 591436 - Yeah, I know.<br />- I'm tired. Come on.
591560 595155 Maybe I'll take you upstairs and<br />violate you like a parkin' meter.
595280 597874 - Cost you a quarter.<br />- Yo, Adrian!
598000 600753 Where'd you learn to talk dirty like that?
602640 606713 Uncle Paulie,<br />you notice somethin' strange about Dad?
606840 609035 He just took a few hard shots.
609160 612357 I think you tell<br />better jokes than me, Adrian.
615560 616595 Yo!
616720 620110 Did I hear somebody<br />call for their old man? Did you do this?
620240 621912 Sleep time, kid, OK?
622040 625476 Dad, did you know your bones<br />grow three times as fast at night?
625600 628956 No, I didn't, but I heard somethin' like that.<br />Is that me?
629080 631116 - Oh yeah, that's you.<br />- Excellent!
631240 634232 - Is that me? When we was fishin', right?<br />- Yeah.
634360 636590 That's beautiful! Look at the tent.
636720 639871 You know,<br />the fish was a lot bigger, if I recall.
640800 643109 Actually, that was a lot smaller.
643600 647559 Anyway, come on. Hit the bed.<br />It's time for you to get healthy.
647680 650672 This is great.<br />I don't know where you learned this.
650800 654395 It is something how this thing<br />comes out of your fingers and...
654520 656476 Oh my God.
657120 659076 Oh my God!
661040 662996 Who's this?
663880 666952 That's Madame Dupont,<br />my French teacher.
667560 669516 Really?!
671200 673668 Hmm, yeah. She looks French, sure.
673800 678749 I wouldn't show this to your mother, cos<br />she... don't understand French too good.
678880 681599 God. Better cover that one up.
681720 684109 Well, champ, it's bedtime.
684240 686993 Hey, you know what?<br />I know some French talk.
687120 689156 - Knock, knock.<br />- Who's there?
689280 691555 - Madame.<br />- Madame who?
691680 694558 - My damn foot's caught in the door!<br />- That's an old joke!
694680 697194 What do you want from me? I'm trying.
697320 699629 I don't know all the good things,<br />you know?
699760 702832 - Whoa! What's this?<br />- What?
703560 707872 Look what I found in your ear.<br />Russian money. Money ears!
708320 711232 All right. Anyway, listen.<br />You gotta get some sleep.
711360 715751 Dad? Today, when you said<br />having me was like being born again...
715880 718314 - Yeah?<br />- What did you mean?
718440 721273 Well, you know, you come up like I did...
721400 727350 ...and you got, like, three square meals<br />of zero a day - know what I mean? -
727480 729675 ...you got the A-side of life and the B-side.
729800 733349 I'm on the B-side, but you...<br />you got all the breaks.
733480 737632 So when I see you having<br />all these things that I didn't have...
737760 740638 ...l, like, live through your eyes.
740760 745151 I enjoy it a little bit.<br />It's like having it all over again.
745280 747271 That's nice.
747400 751393 Hey, look in my face.<br />Do I look like a raccoon?
752120 754236 - A little bit.<br />- Like Rocky Raccoon?
754360 755952 - Yeah, a little bit.<br />- Nah!
756080 757911 - Yeah, you do a little.<br />- Really?
758040 762591 Hey, if you think I look bad,<br />you oughta see the other guy's knuckles.
763640 766154 Anyway, yo! Good... night.
766280 768236 - OK, kid?<br />- Night.
769720 771438 - Dad?<br />- Yo?
772520 776035 - Glad you're home.<br />- Thanks. I appreciate it.
776680 780593 We'll play tomorrow, OK? Maybe<br />you can show me your English teacher.
780720 783154 - She's pretty hot too.<br />- Nah!
783680 785318 Good night, kid.
785440 787670 <i>(Adrian)</i> You deserve the worst<br />for what you did.
787800 790678 - That was Rocky's money.<br />- You wanna be hysterical?
790800 793553 - You cost us everything.<br />- It was a mistake.
793680 796194 You think I thought<br />this was gonna happen?
796320 800916 Don't you walk away from me.<br />You just gave up our life!
801040 803235 And you think it's some stupid thing?
803360 807239 Paulie, do you know what you did?<br />Do you know the seriousness of it?
807360 811751 I understand it!<br />I understand the whole freakin' thing!
811880 815111 I understand it!<br />Your accountant's a crook, not me!
815240 817993 I did what I thought was right.<br />Don't blame me.
818120 820475 I want to murder the bum<br />worse than anybody!
820600 822556 Adrian, what's wrong?
822680 825240 Look what you done now.<br />She's dumpin' it all on me.
825360 828238 - Come on, don't turn this around on me.<br />- What did you do?
828360 831716 He gave power of attorney<br />to our accountant.
832640 835438 I just didn't gave anything to nobody.
835560 838916 He sent a letter. He says<br />"We'll be in Russia a couple of months...
839040 841429 ...and I need Rocky<br />to sign a tax extension."
841560 845109 That extension was<br />a power of attorney, Paulie!
845240 848118 He's the thief! I need alcohol.
848240 851835 Rocky, on my eyes,<br />I never stole a freakin' dime!
851960 854474 Adrian, what's happenin' here?
854600 856556 - It's gone.<br />- What's gone?
856680 860673 The money. The money.<br />Everything. It's all gone.
860880 865078 The piece of paper Paulie had you sign<br />wasn't a request for a tax extension.
865200 869079 It was a blanket power of attorney<br />in favour of the accountant...
869200 871953 ...who was involved in<br />some high-priced real estate.
872080 876073 He thought he could have your money<br />back before you knew it was gone.
876200 878919 Unfortunately for you<br />and everybody in this room...
879040 883158 ...his deals fell through because the<br />market dried up. And you lost millions.
883280 887353 - Ain't there nothin' I can do?<br />- I've filed eight criminal acts against him.
887480 890153 But you've got debt payment<br />on this property...
890280 894478 ...he didn't pay your tax returns and your<br />mortgage hasn't been paid in months!
894600 897876 We didn't have a mortgage.<br />Our house was fully paid for.
898000 902949 - Don't take it from me. Ask him.<br />- There's nearly $400,000 outstanding.
903080 906709 The only thing that's not encumbered<br />is a gym, willed to your son...
906840 909752 ...by a Mickey Goldmill in 1982.
909880 912917 You can sell things.<br />Remember those commercials you did?
913040 916476 I ain't no commercial kinda guy.<br />I'm a fighter. That's what I do.
916600 920752 Nah, we couldn't get sponsors.<br />With the investigation of the accountant...
920880 924429 ...out pops a criminal record<br />of Rocky's for assault.
924560 926949 But that was a long time ago.<br />He didn't know...
927080 931153 Why not a couple more fights? With<br />your popularity, you'd be out in no time.
931280 933794 - He's retiring.<br />- Rocko, fightin's the ticket.
933920 937799 I said he's retired.<br />Paulie, we're here because of you!
937920 941879 I'm not taking the heat for all this.<br />I thought I was doing smart business.
942000 947279 - You thought you did smart business?!<br />- Hey! The accountant was your choice!
947400 952155 You shoulda known he was a thief, but in<br />your fairy-tale world the air don't move.
952280 954953 - You're like a season that don't change!<br />- Hey, enough.
955080 957992 - I'm not no tomato can you kick around!<br />- Paulie! No!
958120 962193 You call Duke. Tell him I'll fight Cane.<br />I don't care. Anywhere, any time.
962320 965630 - No! Rocky, no!<br />- If that's what you want, I'll get on it.
965760 969036 - Rocky, please!<br />- A couple of fights, we're outta trouble.
969160 971833 - Yeah, but you said...<br />- No, I didn't say anything.
971960 974952 - Did we come this far to lose it?<br />- You have to see a doctor.
975080 980029 - I don't need a doctor. I need a promoter.<br />- If the doctor says OK, I'll support you.
980160 983516 I gotta fight, OK?<br />I got problems. I gotta fight.
983640 985596 Will you do it for me?
987520 989033 All right. For you.
989920 992593 Because of continuous<br />violent blows to the head...
992720 997157 ...you have a condition particular to boxers<br />called <i>cavum septum pellucidum...</i>
997280 1000431 ...which is a hole in the membrane<br />separating the ventricles.
1000560 1004235 The brain surface neurons in this area<br />have also been traumatised.
1004360 1009753 Simply stated, Mr Balboa, it means you've<br />suffered some damage to the brain.
1009880 1014112 <i>- (Adrian)</i> How long until he recovers?<br />- The effects are irreversible.
1014240 1015878 Oh, I...
1016000 1018195 Rocky, you... you have to retire.
1018320 1023519 I don't wanna retire. This ain't the time<br />to retire. Not in here, not in no office.
1024440 1029275 I just fought the best fight of my life.<br />I just did that, you know?
1029400 1034155 - And all I need is... a couple more.<br />- No. You suffered severe brain trauma.
1034280 1036840 He could be wrong.<br />Anybody could be wrong.
1036960 1039349 He ain't God.<br />Adrian, only God ain't wrong.
1039480 1043155 - Rocky, this is what's good for you.<br />- I only need a couple of easy ones.
1043280 1047910 Not the way it is. You can't get licensed<br />in any State. He can't, can he, Doctor?
1048040 1051749 - That is correct.<br />- Rocky, do you love me?
1054160 1058597 - Yeah, I love you. Why do you ask that?<br />- Because if you love somebody...
1058720 1062679 ...you live with them, you live for them.<br />You don't gamble with a life.
1062800 1066475 Rocky, I don't care about the money.<br />It's you.
1066600 1068556 That's all that matters.
1069800 1073918 Please. We'll be OK. We'll be fine.

1146880 1148632 Yeah, right.
1149640 1153918 Come on. You know, Mickey used to say<br />a fight ain't over till you heard the bell.
1154040 1155996 We ain't heard a bell yet, have we?
1156120 1159476 <i>(auctioneer) Rocky Balboa's</i><br /><i>boxing gloves from his first...</i>
1176560 1178790 Rocky?
1179440 1181590 Hey, it still fits.
1183640 1186200 Why are you wearin' those clothes?
1186320 1191269 I was just going through some stuff and I<br />found 'em. They feel kinda comfortable.
1191400 1195359 I was looking all over for you downstairs.<br />It's kind of depressing.
1195480 1198074 Yeah. I know what you mean.
1198200 1201158 Oh! What's this doin' in your ear?
1202000 1204639 - Oh, God!<br />- Remember these?
1204760 1207115 I... Yeah.
1208400 1213918 - I remember when you took 'em off.<br />- That's right. First time I ever kissed you.
1216160 1221234 Adrian, I wanna go out for a bit.<br />You know, just take a little walk.
1221360 1224750 I just wanna feel better.<br />But hey, could you talk to the kid?
1224880 1229351 - Cos he's... he's really taking this hard.<br />- Sure.
1230400 1234154 - Where are you going?<br />- I thought I'd go to Andy's.
1243960 1247714 <i>- (man)</i> He used to be a champion.<br /><i>- (woman)</i> How did he blow it all?
1276360 1278715 How you doin', Mick?
1346080 1348036 Slip the jab.
1349160 1351993 - Slip the jab.<br /><i>- (Mick) Slip the jab.</i>
1353640 1355596 Slip the jab!
1357560 1359437 That's right. That's it.
1359560 1362313 - Hey, I didn't hear no bell!<br />- OK.
1363440 1366432 All right! That's right. Slip the jab.
1366560 1370269 That's it. Mentalise!<br />See that bum in front of you.
1370400 1374279 You see yourself doin' right,<br />and you do right.
1374400 1376868 That's pretty. That's very pretty.
1377000 1378877 Time!
1379000 1381912 Come here, Rock.<br />My God, you're ready, ain't ya?
1382040 1386079 Apollo won't know what hit him.<br />You'll roll over him like a bulldozer.
1386200 1388156 An Italian bulldozer.
1388280 1392159 You know, kid, I know how you feel<br />about this fight that's comin' up.
1392280 1394555 Because I was young once too.
1395720 1398154 I tell you somethin'.
1398280 1400635 Why, if you wasn't here...
1400760 1403957 ...hey, I probably wouldn't be alive today.
1404080 1408631 The fact that you're here and doin'<br />as well as you're doin' gives me...
1408760 1412992 What do you call it?<br />A motivisation to stay alive.
1413120 1417432 <i>Cos I think that people die sometimes</i><br /><i>when they don't wanna live no more.</i>
1417560 1419596 Nature's smarter than people think.
1419720 1423998 And nature is smarter than people think.<br />Little by little we lose our friends...
1424120 1428830 ...we lose everything and we keep<br />losin' and losin', till we say...
1428960 1433351 ..."What the hell am I livin' around<br />here for? I got no reason to go on."
1434400 1436755 But with you, kid...
1436880 1439110 Boy, I got a reason to go on.
1439560 1443678 <i>And I'm gonna stay alive.</i><br /><i>And I will watch you make good.</i>
1443800 1448078 - And I'll never leave you.<br />- I'll never leave you until that happens.
1448200 1452796 Cos when I leave you,<br />you'll not only know how to fight...
1452920 1456959 ...you'll be able to take care of yourself<br />outside the ring too. Is that OK?
1457080 1459674 <i>- It's OK.</i><br /><i>- OK.</i>
1460720 1462711 - I got a gift for you.<br />- Ah, Mickey.
1462840 1465957 - Wait a minute now.<br />- Really, I don't need nothin'.
1466080 1472474 Look at that. See that? This here's the<br />favourite thing that I have on this earth.
1472600 1475717 And Rocky Marciano give me that.
1475840 1478559 You know what it was? His cuff link.
1479600 1482592 And now I'm givin' it to you.
1482720 1485632 <i>And it's gonna be like, uh...</i>
1485760 1489275 Like an angel on your shoulder, see?
1489400 1494599 And if you ever get hurt and<br />you feel that you're goin' down...
1494720 1497678 ...this little angel<br />is gonna whisper in your ear.
1497800 1501156 He's gonna say<br />"Get up, you son of a bitch!"
1502760 1505035 "Cos Mickey loves you."
1505160 1507515 <i>OK?</i>
1507640 1510438 Thanks, Mick. I love you too.
1510560 1512994 Jesus. Go after him, kid.
1514320 1516436 - Go after him.<br />- Thanks.
1520520 1523034 You was the angel.
1523160 1526118 - There it is.<br />- What happened to his other cuff link?
1526240 1528879 I don't know. He only give me one.
1529000 1531150 He gave it to some bum.

1666680 1668875 When'd you start that?
1669000 1672629 I don't know. It's like a bad<br />habit that comes back. But, hey!
1672760 1675718 We ain't talkin' about me.<br />We're talkin' about you.
1675840 1677796 Hey, Rocky, how you doin', man?
1677920 1680388 - Good to see you back.<br />- Thanks. Great to <i>be</i> back.
1680520 1684149 You're smart in school,<br />but you gotta be smart on the street too.
1684280 1687033 - How do you mean?<br />- You gotta know who the players are...
1687160 1691392 ...and who you're talkin' to.<br />- Watch out for scams. Everyone scams.
1691520 1693750 - What's a scam?<br />- Ask your father.
1694240 1696879 - A scam is like a hustle.<br />- He don't get it.

1702280 1706239 - You used his head for a punchin' bag.<br />- Yeah, he had a nice head.
1707360 1710796 - Anyway, a hustle's related to a con.<br />- He don't get it.
1710920 1714071 A deception?<br />You're saying beware of deceptions.
1714200 1718079 Yeah, that's good. Absolutely.<br />You're very smart, you know?
1718200 1719428 Hey!
1719560 1722120 Ain't this where<br />the Atomic Hoagy shop used to be?
1722240 1724117 I'm new here, Dad.
1724240 1728313 - This neighbourhood's got tooth decay.<br />- It's called urban blight.
1729440 1732750 I'll tell you somethin', this place<br />is blightin' everywhere.
1732880 1737112 A little aluminum siding and paint, this<br />place could be OK. What do you think?
1737240 1742598 Anyway, we're late for school.<br />Paulie, I wanna talk to the kid private like.
1742720 1744676 - Like I got no feelings.<br />- Oh, come on.
1744800 1747553 - That's how wars start.<br />- Relax, would you?
1747680 1751593 - So anyway, everybody's got an angle.<br />- Yo! Tough break, Rock.
1751720 1756919 Everybody's got a hustle. These kids have<br />got street brains. That's how they live.
1757040 1761511 These kids ain't like no personalities<br />that you've grown up with.
1761640 1765155 - So you gotta stay very sharp round here.<br />- I intend to.
1765280 1769831 Intend! You know, sometimes<br />you make me feel very stupid.
1769960 1773350 - Why?<br />- Why? Cos you're smarter than me.
1773480 1774913 - No, I'm not.<br />- Yeah, you are.
1775040 1778874 It's like every day you learn somethin'<br />new and I forget somethin' new.
1779000 1781719 But hey, listen.<br />We're in this thing together.
1781840 1785469 If you can figure out how to fix things up,<br />don't be afraid to tell me.
1785600 1788478 We gotta stick together, cos what are we?
1788600 1790955 - What?<br />- What are we?
1792240 1795118 - Oh, home team.<br />- Home team! You've got that right.
1795240 1800917 I used to go to this school when I was<br />a kid. Nice bricks. It was real tough then.
1801040 1804237 But... I think you can handle it,<br />don't you think?
1806640 1809438 If you went here, I can go here.
1809560 1811915 I'm not scared really.
1812040 1813871 Really?
1814000 1816309 Well, I guess I'm a little scared.
1816440 1819830 - But that's normal, don't you think?<br />- Oh, yeah. I had 72 fights...
1819960 1825114 ...and every one of 'em I was scared, so<br />yeah, you know, that's real, real normal.
1827800 1831236 - I'll see you later.<br />- OK, kid. Here's the front door.
1833280 1835271 Hey, wait! What's this?
1836680 1839114 Goodness gracious!<br />Where'd this come from?
1839240 1842437 It's a strange place<br />to stash your lunch money, don't you...
1842560 1844437 It's just a lunch joke, you know?
1844560 1848155 - Thanks, Dad.<br />- OK, listen. I'll see you later.
1848280 1851670 Remember, Daddy loves you.<br />You're number one. Home team!
1851800 1854155 Just be nice, right? You'll be OK.
1855040 1859989 And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend.<br />They don't like that around here.
1865880 1868030 You know,<br />I'm really worried about the kid.
1868160 1871470 He ain't used to livin' like this.<br />He don't know the streets.
1871600 1873875 At school, I know what's gonna happen.
1874000 1878835 Some wise guy's gonna come up to him<br />cos he's my kid and try to bang him out.
1878960 1881793 Give him a cheap shot, you know?<br />I mean, jeez...
1881920 1885515 - Mr Balboa, my name's Tommy Gunn.<br />- Yeah? How you doin'?
1885640 1887756 With that name, you better be tough!
1887880 1892351 It ain't easy. Anyway, I'm from Oklahoma.<br />My amateur record is 45 to 1.
1892480 1896155 - I turned pro at 18 and I had eight fights.<br />- You're a fighter?
1896280 1899317 And now that I'm 20,<br />I'd just like to show you what I got.
1899440 1903115 - I've saved up to pay for training.<br />- Mr Rocky Balboa!
1903240 1907552 Excuse me, I have some business here.<br />Good to see you again, friend.
1907680 1910877 <i>- (Rocky)</i> How you doin'?<br />- My health is fine. What more can I ask?
1911000 1914515 - Listen, I gotta go to work now.<br />- What, here? In a sweatbox?
1914640 1917871 - Can't be good for the image.<br />- Urban light. What can you do?
1918000 1920594 What'd you say? It's blight. Urban blight.
1920720 1924838 George wants you to consider wearing<br />gloves again. It's a helluva payday.
1924960 1927633 - I'm officially expired.<br />- You have marquee value.
1927760 1933278 You put asses into seats. A businessman<br />don't retire if he can still pull in the bread.
1933400 1937632 - Only America gives these opportunities.<br />- Union Cane's going for the title.
1937760 1940832 Here's some tickets.<br />We've a strong feeling about this.
1940960 1944919 - If he takes it, that's the time to challenge.<br />- People love comebacks.
1945040 1948430 There's nothing more commercial<br />than a long-shot comeback...
1948560 1950835 ...of a down-on-his-luck underdog.
1950960 1954953 As Mark Twain said: "Virtue has<br />never been as respectable as money."
1955080 1956672 - Who's Twain?<br />- A painter.
1956800 1958836 You're the Great White Hope.
1958960 1961679 You mean Great White Dope. No, forget it.
1961800 1965952 Hold the bullshit. I know the problem.<br />You think I was born yesterday?
1966080 1971074 Merlin, show him the paper. This is your<br />medical report. We can work around it.
1971200 1973430 - Where'd you get this?<br />- It doesn't matter.
1973560 1976791 If you fight Cane, George can<br />guarantee to get you a license.
1976920 1978512 - Guaranteed.<br />- You can do this?
1978640 1981234 - No problem.<br />- This comeback's in the bag.
1981360 1985512 - The time's hot. The deal's hot. <i>Caliente!</i><br />- We could use one more payday.
1985640 1990077 - Adrian, where'd you come from?<br />- Mrs Balboa just appeared! She's magic!
1990200 1993636 I don't think you're funny.<br />Are you talking him into fighting?
1993760 1997070 Talking business, darlin'.<br />Do you like feelin' hard up?
1997200 2001557 Do you like reachin' in your pocket<br />and only feelin' your leg? I didn't think so.
2001680 2004956 I'm offering you the opportunity<br />to dump this loser image.
2005080 2008197 - Who are you talking to?<br />- You ain't workin' across...
2008320 2012279 What the hell are you talkin' about?<br />This is a tremendous opportunity!
2012400 2016154 Opportunity for who? For you to make<br />money? For him to be disabled?
2016280 2018953 What would you do<br />if the choices were reversed?
2019080 2021071 You have to think about that.
2021200 2023919 Rocky, they don't care about you.
2024520 2028354 Let's get serious. You represent<br />the dreams of the long shots.
2028480 2032792 The little people identify with you.<br />That is the key to public success.
2032920 2037391 You a true champion, a true product of<br />the people. Sell it while they'll still buy.
2037520 2041274 That ain't gonna last forever.<br />You say you a fighter, then fight!
2041400 2045632 And I'll make you so much money you<br />can swim in it. You can swim, can't you?
2045760 2048957 Whaddaya say?<br />Put some hustle behind this muscle.
2049080 2051674 He's done! He's done fighting!
2058600 2060750 You a damn fool.
2062360 2065193 Maybe we oughta sign<br />Mrs Balboa to fight Cane, huh?
2065320 2069199 Looks like she's the one<br />with the <i>cojones</i> in the family.
2070600 2073194 You don't talk like that in front of my wife.
2073800 2075756 That ain't no park bench, boy.
2079480 2083519 - I'll get him.<br />- Rocky, I'm really sorry. I didn't wanna...
2083640 2086154 You guys want privacy? I'll be upstairs.
2090000 2092275 Rocky.
2092400 2094516 Rocky, I'm sorry. I... I...
2094640 2097871 But it just takes one bad hit<br />and you could be an invalid.
2098000 2102676 I feel like an invalid already. Why'd you<br />come back? You're too smart for this!
2102800 2106076 I got nothing to do. Gloria - I called Gloria.
2106200 2110239 - She said she could use part-time help.<br />- But why do you wanna do this?
2110360 2114239 Why go back to where you started?<br />I gotta do it, but you don't gotta do it!
2114360 2117716 I wanted to be there<br />so I could be close to you.
2126760 2129718 All right, yeah.<br />You know, it's gettin' cold out here.
2129840 2132991 Maybe we better get inside, OK?<br />I understand.
2133120 2134872 - Are you all right?<br />- What?
2135000 2137639 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine.
2137760 2139910 Adrian, it's gettin' cold, OK?
2145480 2149075 Yo, Adrian! Did we ever leave this place?
2151760 2153716 I don't know.
2158680 2161274 Hey, mind if I talk to you now?
2161400 2163960 My head's a little busy right now.
2175200 2177555 You won't get him.<br />Balboa don't think straight.
2177680 2181593 - None of these bums do. I need an angle.<br />- I'll fight Balboa right now.
2181920 2184957 - I'm better than Balboa ever was.<br />- Hey! Hey!
2186000 2188798 I own the paper on you.<br />You will fight who I tell you...
2188920 2192196 ...where I tell you<br />and how I tell you. You got that?
2193240 2196152 Don't aggravate<br />the hand that feeds you, huh?
2199400 2201960 None of these bums think straight.
2205600 2207272 All I need is a hook.
2218440 2221000 Hey! Ain't you Rocky's kid?
2221120 2224317 - Yeah! You Rocky's kid, right?<br />- Yeah. How're you doing?
2224440 2226431 I've seen your picture in the paper.
2226560 2229757 - You know what? Your old man's a punk.<br />- What?!
2231120 2233793 - Get off me!<br />- What are you wearing my coat for?
2233920 2236388 - Just leave him alone!<br />- You wanna beatin' too?
2236520 2239671 - Gimme my coat! I'm not kiddin' around.<br />- No way!
2246840 2250515 - Don't get sick now!<br />- Hope you don't catch cold, rich boy!
2254560 2257870 Keep it high. Slip and slide. That's it.
2258000 2261356 This is the cup Rocky drinks out of<br />around the house. Ten bucks.
2261480 2264790 - How I know it's the real thing?<br />- Look at the lip marks.
2264920 2267878 - All right. Five bucks. No more.<br />- You got a deal.
2268920 2270990 - Excuse me.<br />- Tommy Gunn!
2271120 2273873 - Is there some place I can change?<br />- In there.
2274000 2276753 Time! Hey, Richard,<br />good friend, listen to me.
2276880 2279348 If you wanna survive,<br />you gotta slip the jab.
2279480 2283473 Keep it high and hit and not get hit,<br />you know? OK, take off.
2283600 2286319 - Rocko, remember Tommy Gunn?<br />- Oh, yeah. Yeah.
2286440 2288874 He says he wants to fight.<br />I tell him to get married.
2289000 2290592 Why?
2290720 2294315 - That's gym humour, Rocko.<br />- Oh? OK.
2294440 2297238 Let's see what you got there, kid.
2297360 2299112 Get married. I understand.
2299240 2301993 - Benson! Wanna move a little?<br />- Yeah, all right.
2302120 2306159 Hey, Paulie, what's the <i>cojones?</i>
2306280 2307793 - <i>Cojones?</i><br />- Yeah.
2307920 2310957 <i>Cojones</i> is Latin for Spanish nuts.
2311080 2313833 - Yo, Rock, we're ready.<br />- Wonderful.
2315280 2317999 Hey, kid. You got the headgear?
2318120 2320076 Nah, I don't need one.
2321520 2324159 He's gonna get his <i>cojones</i> knocked out.
2324280 2325952 OK. Ready, guys?
2326080 2329311 - Benson, go easy, all right?<br />- Sure. OK, Rocky.
2329440 2331510 Time!
2331640 2334950 All right, just go easy now.<br />Slip the jab now.
2335080 2337196 Ooh!
2337320 2340278 - Hey, kid! What's his name again?<br />- Tommy Gunn.
2340400 2343233 Tommy, whoa! It ain't no law to duck.
2344400 2346356 Go side to side. That's it.
2346480 2348436 Whoa!
2349440 2354309 - Hey, man! Take it easy!<br />- Come on, lighten up. It's called sparring.
2355280 2357510 Hey! OK! Hey, kid!
2357640 2359835 Hey, lighten up! Time out!
2359960 2362793 Smell that, Rocko?<br />The odour of opportunity.
2362920 2365593 Hey, that's it!<br />What did I tell you? Hey! Time!
2365720 2367711 Hey, that's it! Time!
2370000 2373390 Hey, back off! That's enough!<br />What's the matter with you?
2373520 2377229 - Tommy, are you crazy or somethin'?<br />- What's the matter with you, man?
2377360 2380113 - I'm sorry.<br />- Go cool off, kid. Sorry about this.
2380240 2382629 He stinks of opportunity, Rocko.
2382760 2385957 Hey, look,<br />goin' easy don't mean breakin' bones.
2386080 2390039 - I'm sorry. But what do you think?<br />- What do I think? I don't think you listen.
2390400 2393119 But you - you brawl<br />like you was a street fighter.
2393240 2396869 I know somethin' about that,<br />but this is boxing. It ain't mugging!
2397000 2401869 - I'm sorry, but I know I can do it all.<br />- Yeah? Well, not on this date, OK?
2402000 2405470 - That's it?<br />- I gotta work with these kids here.
2406160 2408116 How about you tryin' to manage me?
2408240 2409434 - Manage?!<br />- Yeah.
2409560 2412358 Unless you think I ain't got nothin' goin'.
2412480 2413879 Nothin' goin'?
2414000 2419154 Yeah, all right, you got a lot goin'. You got<br />a lot of tools. But I ain't no manager.
2419280 2422078 The gentleman that owned this place -<br />that was a manager.
2422200 2425590 But me, I was always the managed... guy.
2426800 2429155 Hey, look. Good luck, all right?
2431560 2433869 All right, guys. Let's go.
2434000 2435956 Come on. Move around.
2437080 2439036 That's it. Nice.
2451200 2454476 All right, you guys, come on.<br />No cheap shots. Move it around.
2461680 2463750 How you doin'?
2463880 2466235 Cold? You look cold.
2467360 2471319 I guess that has something<br />to do with the weather.
2471440 2473715 Here. Take my coat.
2473840 2476593 No, thanks. Where's your boyfriend?
2477520 2480478 Him? Forget it. He ain't got no manners.
2482080 2484435 I'm Jewel, if you wanna know.
2486040 2488076 I'm Robert.
2488200 2489758 Hi.
2490520 2496072 Well, I been living here about<br />six years now. It ain't Disneyland!
2496200 2498839 - You been to Disneyland?<br />- Sure.
2498960 2501554 You make it sound like everybody has.
2501680 2506800 I know you can't tell by the way I look,<br />but I ain't like the other kids around here.
2506920 2509673 Why?<br />I mean, what makes you so different?
2509800 2514237 I don't know. I guess it's cos<br />I wanna get out. You know how it is.
2515080 2517674 Hmm. You know, for an Italian kid...
2518560 2520516 ...you ain't got a bad butt.
2528680 2532150 - First money I get, I'm goin' to Miami.<br />- Why Miami?
2532280 2536592 - Miami needs new gigolos.<br />- Yeah, I read somethin' like that.
2536720 2539188 Ow!
2539320 2542676 My back is getting bad.<br />How come <i>you</i> don't have arthritis?
2542800 2545473 - Ain't I got enough?<br /><i>- (man calls out greeting)</i>
2545600 2548433 Adrian's too good for this.
2548560 2550676 This place really depresses me, Paul.
2550800 2553872 Rock! Come in. Everybody's been<br />askin' for ya. You too, Paulie.
2554000 2557117 - No, thanks. I'm a little beat.<br />- Hey, I'm a little thirsty.
2557240 2558992 - You go if you wanna.<br />- Mr Balboa?
2559120 2562590 - Look at this. Tommy Gunn.<br />- Why are you still hanging around?
2562720 2567271 - Is there somethin' I can do for you?<br />- Yeah. I'd like to try again.
2567400 2571234 Kid, I'd like to help, but I really<br />don't know nothin' about managing.
2571360 2576036 Man, all I'm askin' for is a chance.<br />If I screw up, then hell, I'll leave.
2576160 2580119 - What have you got to lose?<br />- Me? Nothin'. It's what <i>you</i> got to lose.
2580240 2582196 - I got nothin' to lose.<br />- Maybe you do.
2582320 2585995 What if I don't do good, right?<br />And you don't make it?
2586120 2589271 I don't want you blaming me<br />for this, kid, you know?
2589400 2593678 Here's what I would do if I was you.<br />Listen to me. If I was you...
2593800 2598191 ...I would go home and talk to your family<br />people. Come up with somethin' better.
2598320 2601517 I got no family people.<br />All I got is what you see here.
2601640 2605269 I know all about you, back from<br />your first fight with Apollo Creed.
2605400 2608153 I read how nobody cared about you<br />or gave you a chance.
2608280 2611955 I'm not from the same streets as you,<br />but I'm hungry, like you were.
2612080 2614389 Ever since I put on gloves<br />I've wanted to meet you.
2614520 2618672 Cos I knew that if anybody could<br />make me a winner, it was you.
2618800 2621598 Hey, Paulie,<br />you see a winner standing here?
2621720 2625156 Yes! Man, you beat the best.<br />Nobody could ever say different.
2625280 2629193 Look, Rocky, you don't know me,<br />but anything you want me to do, I'll do.
2629320 2631550 And if I can't, I'll bust my butt tryin'.
2631680 2637676 I'm not hustlin' you, man. All I'm askin'<br />for is a chance. I mean, just one shot.
2647160 2649310 Are you hungry?
2650560 2651993 Yeah.
2652120 2654953 Yeah? Come on.
2655080 2657799 You're really gonna like<br />the way Adrian cooks.
2657920 2661674 She does amazing things with macaroni,<br />especially tomatoes.
2661800 2665952 But I gotta warn you,<br />she can be a little vicious with the garlic!
2667560 2671917 - So why'd this kid smack your face?<br />- It really doesn't matter, Dad.
2672040 2675237 - It does matter. They took his coat.<br />- I don't want the coat.
2675360 2677316 They took the one with the collar?
2677440 2680079 - I'll go to your school and...<br />- You'll make it worse!
2680200 2683351 - Can't I do what I think is right?<br />- What do you think is right?
2683480 2686233 - A baseball bat across the face.<br />- Paulie!
2686360 2688669 - Adrian, can I have the plate?<br />- Yes, Rocky.
2688800 2691314 I had trouble like that<br />when I was in school.
2691440 2695228 Every day I got chased by this kid,<br />till one day my mother said to me:
2695360 2698238 - "Pretend the guy's like a balloon."<br />- Balloon?
2698360 2702239 She said if you pop 'em hard,<br />these guys just go away.
2703600 2707388 Tommy, we're trying to raise our son<br />so he can handle his problems...
2707520 2710080 ...with his mind, not his muscles.
2710200 2712236 - Sorry.<br />- That's why I'll get mangled.
2712360 2715955 - You ain't gonna get mangled.<br />- Dad, will you teach me how to fight?
2716080 2717718 A baseball bat would be nice.
2717840 2720673 Do you wanna grow up<br />and just use your fists?
2720800 2723075 Adrian, I don't think it'd be so bad...
2723200 2727113 ...if I taught him how to throw a few...<br />deadly punches.
2727240 2729674 Tommy, did your dad teach you to fight?
2729800 2733395 - No, not exactly. I had to...<br />- Sweetheart, don't get personal.
2733520 2737149 No, it's OK. You see, my old man,<br />he used to drink a lot. Seriously.
2737280 2741512 He'd go out with his friends, then<br />he'd come home, look to punch on me.
2741640 2745189 He'd punch on my mother too.<br />He did that a lot of times.
2745320 2748551 So growin' up,<br />I only thought about fightin' my father.
2748680 2751592 You know, when I was 13,<br />I got in trouble at school.
2751720 2755076 He tied me down and whipped me<br />so bad I couldn't walk for a week.
2755200 2757668 I couldn't do anything.
2757800 2763318 The first guy I ever knocked out was my<br />father. In the ring, it's like all I see is him.
2764080 2765991 That's... kinda sick, huh?
2766920 2770708 Yo, Tommy, at least you had<br />an old man to knock out, you know?
2772640 2774596 Yeah.
2775720 2778996 - I didn't even have that.<br />- Some day you can punch out <i>your</i> pop.
2779120 2784513 - Paulie, what you telling him that for?<br />- It's the fittest of the survival.
2784640 2790158 - Tommy, where you stayin' tonight?<br />- Oh, I'll find some place to stay.
2790280 2793989 No, I tell you what.<br />We got room down in the basement.
2794120 2796554 - What about me?<br />- Your son is sleeping there.
2796680 2800798 - Well, he can stay with his uncle.<br />- What am I? A pit stop?!
2800920 2804037 I don't wanna cause any problems.<br />I can find a place to stay.
2804160 2808199 No, it's OK. It's just for...<br />a little while, you know.
2808320 2812677 Right? No problem at all. Hey, kid.<br />I appreciate it. It's cold outside.
2812800 2817396 - I'm not changin' no sheets.<br />- Hey, since when have you ever?
2817520 2821229 Tommy, why don't you come on down?<br />We'll show you the whole place.
2821360 2826388 Why don't you go downstairs,<br />show your father what you did today?
2829800 2832951 Hey, Junior!<br />Your plumbing don't leak, do it?
2839560 2842279 - You know this guy?<br />- Yeah. He hits hard.
2844960 2848111 - Adrian can really cook!<br />- Yeah, she's OK. Listen, Tommy.
2848240 2851755 We ain't had a chance<br />to get this place too nice.
2851880 2855111 We'll get it together in a while, you know?
2855240 2858198 - Wow! Man, this is what it's about.<br />- Holy mackerel!
2858320 2860959 Why do you keep this stuff down here?
2861080 2865119 When did you get a chance to do this?<br />He took it all out of a box. It's beautiful.
2865240 2868755 You painted... When did you get<br />a chance to do this, kid?
2868880 2872475 - After school. It's no big deal.<br />- Where'd you get the glove?
2872600 2876275 Oh, this? Thanks.<br />This is one of my favourite objects.
2876400 2880791 Mickey give me this before he departed.<br />It was Rocky Marciano's cuff link.
2880920 2884595 - Really? The real Rocky Marciano?<br />- You got me thinkin' about Mickey.
2884720 2887951 I wanna show you somethin'.<br />He told me a long time ago...
2888080 2893313 He says that fighting<br />is like 90% in the skull...
2893440 2895874 ...and 10% in the body.<br />This is what he says to me.
2896000 2899834 - Dad, I met this really nice girl today.<br />- Really? That's wonderful.
2899960 2903669 - She's a lot better than...<br />- Wait a minute. Don't change the station.
2903800 2906951 I'll be right back.<br />I just wanna tell Tommy a few things.
2907080 2910675 Hey, who was your best friend<br />back in Orlando?
2910800 2913872 - Uh, that's Oklahoma.<br />- Well, yeah.
2914000 2916275 - Um, Eric Elder.<br />- No, no, no, no.
2916400 2918868 Your best friend is<br />a guy named Frankie Fear.
2919000 2923437 You see, fear is a fighter's best friend.<br />It ain't nothin' to be ashamed of.
2923560 2928395 You see, fear keeps you sharp. It keeps<br />you awake. It makes you wanna survive.
2928520 2931751 But the thing is,<br />you gotta learn how to control it.
2931880 2935350 Cos fear is like this fire<br />and it's burning deep inside.
2935480 2938472 Now, if you control it, Tommy,<br />it's gonna make you hot.
2938600 2941194 But, you see,<br />if this thing here controls you...
2941320 2945438 ...it's gonna burn you and everything<br />else around you up. That's right.
2945560 2948677 Anyway, these are the things<br />that was taught to me...
2948800 2952156 ...and, if you want, I'd like to teach to you.
2952280 2954794 Does, uh...<br />this mean you're gonna manage me?
2954920 2958037 - Absolutely. Hey, home team.<br />- All right!
2958160 2961357 - Let's go for it.<br />- Do you mind showin' me a few things?
2961480 2963835 Sure, Tommy. I'll show you a lot of things.
2968680 2971752 Hey, rich boy!<br />How much you got in your pocket today?
2971880 2973711 - Nothin'.<br />- Come on, let's have it.
2973840 2976479 - I got nothin'.<br />- Come on, gimme the money.
2976600 2979034 - Come on!<br />- Hey, I gotta eat.
2979160 2982118 He's hungry, he's gotta eat. Well, eat this.
2984960 2987076 I got it. Go!
2987200 2990510 Father Carmine! Yo!
2990640 2992278 Father Carmine!
2992400 2994755 - Maybe he's not home.<br />- Priests is always home.
2994880 2997155 - Oh, Rocky!<br />- Yo!
2997280 2999555 <i>Ma perch� non battesti la porta?</i>
2999680 3002319 I didn't wanna<br />disturb you that much, Father.
3002440 3004715 <i>Che disturbo! E la famiglia, com'e?</i>
3004840 3007593 Oh, excellent. Everything is perfect.
3007720 3010029 Father, this is my new friend,<br />Tommy Gunn.
3010160 3012958 <i>Tanto piacere di fare la conoscenza!</i>
3013080 3015719 <i>- Che posso fare per te, Rocky?</i><br />- I was wondering...
3015840 3018798 Tommy here's a fighter<br />and I'm his manager.
3018920 3021798 I wondered if you'd do me a favour,<br />if you ain't busy.
3021920 3026675 Could you throw us a couple blessings?<br />One, that I don't mess up as a manager.
3026800 3030270 And B, that Tommy does<br />as good as I think he can do: Great.
3030400 3034518 - And don't get hurt. Could you do that?<br /><i>- Ma sicuro! 'U piacere e mio!</i>
3034640 3040237 <i>In nome del padre, del figlio e</i><br /><i>dello spirito santo... E cosi sia.</i>
3040360 3044114 I love it when he does that.<br />Thanks, Father! Really appreciate this!
3044240 3047949 - <i>Tanto piacere.</i> Any time.<br />- OK. I'll see you in church.
3048080 3051311 <i>Si, sicuramente. Venite tutti due!</i>
3051440 3056389 - Hey, man, what'd you do this for?<br />- It don't hurt havin' an angel on your side.
3060200 3062794 - Hey, Rock! How's it goin'?<br />- Doin' great, guys!
3062920 3064717 Slow down or you'll get a ticket!
3064840 3067991 - This is Tommy Gunn. He'll be a champ.<br />- How you doin', Tom?
3068720 3070676 <i>(bell)</i>
3077680 3080433 All right, break it up! Break! Break!
3092320 3094151 Get off the ropes!
3101280 3103077 - Go easy.<br />- Man, I need more work.
3103200 3105998 - No, you're ready.<br />- No, this guy's killin' me.
3106120 3109112 - You're ready now. You're perfect.<br />- He's killin' me!
3109240 3111879 - I feel weak.<br />- No, listen to me. Shut up!
3112000 3115470 Mick used to say the only difference<br />between a hero and a coward...
3115600 3118478 ...is the hero's willing to<br />go for it. Take the shot.
3118600 3121319 This guy here is scared too.<br />You're both scared.
3121440 3125479 Remember in the basement we talked<br />about fear? How it was like this fire?
3125600 3129195 You gotta control it or it burns you up.<br />Or it's gonna burn him up.
3129320 3131151 Make it work for you, Tommy.
3131280 3134317 I would never do nothin'<br />to hurt you, understand?
3134440 3138672 Fear is like this fire, OK? Now let it burn<br />until it becomes like this volcano.
3138800 3142349 When you see the openin',<br />explode all over this guy, OK?
3142480 3146234 Now, you can take him, OK?<br />It ain't all muscle, it's all heart.
3146360 3150069 Heart and fire! Heart and fire!<br />OK, now you do it!
3152040 3154679 Remember,<br />I'm like this angel on your shoulder.
3154800 3157872 I ain't gonna let nothin'<br />happen to you. Go for it!

3693000 3696515 Sure it is... Yo, Adrian, look at this.
3698600 3701717 I wanna give this to him.<br />What do you think?

3714680 3717877 Only in America!<br />Havin' the best and wearin' the best.
3718000 3721356 - But you gotta stay on top.<br />- Nobody remembers number two.
3721480 3725075 - I sure don't.<br />- I checked with the boxing commission.
3725200 3729512 It seems there's no formal contract<br />between you and Balboa.
3729640 3731596 No, nothin'. Just a handshake.
3731720 3736919 This is a complex business. You got to<br />stay sharp. I don't have to tell you that.
3737040 3740874 It's hard livin' in Rocky's shadow,<br />people callin' you his puppet.
3741000 3742638 No one else could do it so long.
3742760 3747117 Tommy, I'm afraid that if you<br />keep goin' the way you're goin'...
3747240 3750391 ...you're gonna be<br />watchin' the parade go by.
3750520 3753990 - Exactly.<br />- You haven't had the big payday yet.
3754120 3759114 And you won't until you fight those<br />top contenders that I do surely own.
3759760 3762035 I got the contracts.
3762160 3764276 It's a complex business.
3764400 3767039 But if you want the best, go with the best.
3767160 3769720 - What about Rocky?<br />- Rocky can still train you.
3769840 3774436 My God, he's done a wonderful job.<br />Now look, here's $20,000.
3774560 3776915 Take it as an advance.

3825000 3829118 Hey, Santa, tell all the kids<br />what you've got in the bag for them...
3829240 3832550 ...that you brought from the north.<br />- I got my laundry.
3832680 3835956 - No, you got the wrong bag.<br />- Come on, Chubby. Get outta the way.
3836080 3838389 Let Santa sit down. Come here, little boy.
3838520 3840954 - You been nice?<br />- Uncle Paulie!

3845200 3849034 - I don't need nothin'.<br />- Come on, kid. Tell Santa what you want.
3849160 3852311 That ain't Santa.<br />It's Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.
3852440 3855034 What do you mean?<br />Why are you talkin' like that?
3855160 3859199 We're just tryin' to have a good time.<br />Santa's here and everything...
3859320 3861436 It's stupid!
3861560 3865792 Yo, you know... Come on, it ain't stupid.<br />We're just tryin' to pretend here.
3865920 3870550 You see, you're supposed to be<br />pretending. It's like this game, right?
3870680 3873148 I don't like pretending.<br />You guys talk to Santa.
3873280 3877159 Hey, kid, I ain't talkin' to them.<br />I'm talkin' with <i>you</i> here.
3877280 3880511 See, it's very important that<br />you spend time with the family...
3880640 3885191 ...and have a good time and just get the<br />spirit goin', you know? It's good, right?
3885320 3887675 Good for what? Come on, let's go.
3888960 3891315 His friends are here. He doesn't want to.
3891440 3895115 - Adrian, I know what he wants.<br />- How do you know what I want?
3895240 3897879 - Cos I know you.<br />- You know me?
3898000 3899956 He thinks he knows me.
3901400 3905951 - Look, I ain't celebratin' nothin', OK?<br />- Hey, wait. What's the matter with you?
3906080 3910756 We always done this before. We always<br />had a good time. It don't have to change.
3910880 3915510 Do you remember last year, when<br />we had fun, when we had a good time?
3915640 3918837 It ain't last year and<br />you ain't the same either.
3920480 3922914 What?!
3925080 3927753 Adrian, what did I do?
3927880 3929836 Go talk to him.
3932560 3934710 Even I coulda saw this thing happening.
3934840 3937752 I shoulda went to Miami<br />when I had the chance.
3938960 3941394 You wanna talk? Let's talk.
3942440 3946194 Well, you know,<br />I thought we was supposed to be like...
3946320 3949232 You know, be very close.<br />Hey, come on, kid. I love you.
3949360 3951316 No, you don't.
3951440 3953908 Sure I do. Remember what the deal was?
3954040 3957749 We was supposed to be tight,<br />like crossed fingers.
3957880 3961589 You want you and Tommy to be tight.<br />That's what you're talkin' about.
3961720 3963790 - Oh, don't say that!<br />- Why can't I say it?
3963920 3966195 Since he came it's Tommy this,<br />Tommy that.
3966320 3969073 You got no time for nobody,<br />so I got no time for you.
3969200 3971873 What are you sayin'?<br />You're like another person.
3972000 3976437 <i>You're</i> the other person. You said I would<br />be number one to you and you lied!
3976560 3978551 You lied to me and you lied to Mom!
3978880 3982031 I never lied to you.<br />Tommy needed my help.
3982480 3984311 So did I.
3984440 3988069 And remember when you said to<br />watch out for scams and deceptions?
3988200 3989553 Yeah?
3989680 3992433 <i>You're</i> the one that shoulda watched out.
3999280 4000793 - Where are you going?<br />- Out!
4000920 4002592 - When'll you be back?<br />- Later.
4002720 4004676 - Later? When?<br />- Later.
4009240 4011674 Season's greetings, Mrs Balboa!
4013000 4015434 You take care of these people.
4016480 4019313 Behold the Santa for all seasons!
4020960 4022951 Are you guys lost?
4023080 4026277 <i>Au contraire, mon ami.</i><br />I know exactly where I am.
4027920 4032835 Yo, Rocko! Guess what's comin' to dinner.<br />Tommy Gunn's got new friends.
4032960 4034996 <i>(Duke)</i> New friends for a new year!
4035480 4038438 Oh, please. Oh, Paulie!
4039440 4041670 Nice tree. Charming.
4042640 4047111 - Hey, Tommy. How you doin'?<br />- Merry Christmas, milord. Greetings!
4047240 4049151 - Yeah, how you doin'?<br />- Listen.
4049280 4052636 I don't want to take up too much time.<br />Season's greetings.
4052760 4056196 - I don't need no presents.<br />- You've done a helluva job with the man.
4056320 4060871 Facts are facts. I'd have to be blind<br />if I didn't see a title shot on the cards.
4061000 4063992 - Title shot?<br />- Right. We'll work beautifully together.
4064120 4066315 No problems.
4066440 4071878 No friction. Only harmony, huh? It's time<br />to put some hustle behind this muscle.
4072600 4075990 Tommy-boy's got a little something<br />personal to discuss with you.
4076120 4079078 So I'm gonna be sayin' good night.<br />Merry Christmas.
4079200 4082158 - Merry Christmas to you.<br />- See you soon, huh?
4083560 4086233 Sorry I'm late.<br />I got hung up havin' dinner.
4086360 4090797 Hey, that's OK, Tommy. Adrian cooked<br />somethin', but it's probably all cold.
4090920 4095994 - What we can do is make sandwiches.<br />- Rocky, I don't wanna make sandwiches.
4096120 4098315 Tommy, why did you bring him here?
4098440 4102877 He just wanted to come by. Rocky, mind<br />if I talk to you outside about a few things?
4103000 4104956 Oh, yeah. Sure.
4105080 4107389 It's getting late.<br />We have to be there by ten.
4107520 4109875 - Rocky...<br />- No, it's OK.
4113240 4115595 Hey, Tommy,<br />what do you wanna talk to me about?
4115720 4117711 - Isn't it a long drive?<br />- Yeah.
4117840 4120479 So, uh... what do you think?
4120600 4122830 - Where'd you get this?<br />- Duke gave it to me.
4122960 4124632 Tommy...!
4124760 4127479 Hey, maybe you oughta<br />give this thing back.
4127600 4129591 Man, I knew it! I knew you'd say that.
4129720 4132359 Give it back? Why?<br />He likes the way I fight.
4132480 4134436 - It's almost ten.<br />- We'll make it.
4134560 4136755 I know, but you see what he's doin' here?
4136880 4140509 Tommy, hey,<br />don't let him put nothin' between us, OK?
4140640 4144155 Put like what? The guy was<br />just talking about getting a shot.
4144280 4147636 Look, we don't need him.<br />I mean, you're gonna get a shot.
4147760 4149716 You'll be able to buy ten of these.
4149840 4152957 When you gonna wake up?<br />We're watchin' the parade go by.
4153080 4155674 What parade? What are you talkin' about?
4155800 4159554 The big time. The way I'm goin',<br />I won't get a shot for a long time.
4159680 4162990 I've got a perfect record.<br />I'm 22 and 0. Where's the money?
4163120 4166795 Where? We haven't made serious money.<br />And we won't without the man.
4166920 4171596 I ain't talkin' about money. It'll be there.<br />I'm talkin' about your rep, Tommy.
4171720 4175998 - Don't sell out. We don't need this guy.<br />- Listen. Duke is a wonderful man.
4176120 4178270 - Put the top up.<br />- Forget about the top!
4178400 4182916 - I'm signin' papers with him tomorrow.<br />- You sign them, you're like his property.
4183040 4187795 You got no control. This is a dirty<br />business, full of thieves and gangsters.
4187920 4193756 They promise every good young fighter<br />who comes by, they promise the world.
4193880 4198112 And then they suck 'em dry and<br />they leave 'em in the gutter broke.
4198240 4200276 That's the way this business is run.
4200400 4205428 Guys like Duke... You know what he is?<br />He's a vampire. He's livin' off your blood.
4205560 4209189 Tommy, you know, the thing I'm<br />tryin' to do is what Mick done for me.
4209320 4212676 He tried to keep me away from<br />the dirty part of the business...
4212800 4216315 ...the way I'm tryin' to do for you.<br />- I ain't you. And you ain't Mick.
4216440 4220558 When are you gonna understand this is<br />a business? And in business you need...
4220680 4223069 - What, brains?<br />- You said that, not me.
4223200 4227830 - You saying I got no brains?<br />- Duke gave me my title shot, you didn't.
4227960 4230599 If you wanna keep trainin' me, do it.<br />If not, don't!
4230720 4233154 But it's my way or it's the highway.
4233800 4235119 Tommy!
4235240 4237754 <i>(intense ringing)</i>
4243320 4245788 Rocky, put on your coat.
4245920 4249799 Just put on your coat.<br />Come on. It's not worth it.
4249920 4252115 Adrian, it is worth it. The kid's confused.
4252240 4254993 - You don't see what's happening.<br />- Yeah, I do see!
4255120 4258510 - He's twisted around by Duke.<br />- Come on, it's you. It's not him.
4258640 4262758 You can't live backwards or turn back<br />the clocks. We live now. We live here.
4262880 4265678 Hey, I know where we live!<br />Do you think I'm stupid?
4265800 4267756 I'm not as dumb as you think I am!
4267880 4271509 I look. You don't think I can smell it?<br />I see where we are!
4271640 4276031 I don't want this no more! I want<br />something good for the family, not this!
4276160 4280392 I don't want this! Did I come back here<br />and get my brains beat out...
4280520 4285435 ...for guys to say "There goes Balboa,<br />just another bum in the neighbourhood"?
4285560 4289348 - I didn't want this!<br />- No! Come on, nobody says that.
4289480 4293473 I'm sayin' it, Adrian.<br />I'm sayin' this! I'm sayin' this.
4293600 4297479 When that kid was in the ring,<br />you know what I was doin'? I was winnin'.
4297600 4299556 - You were winning?<br />- Yeah, it was...
4299680 4302911 It was my last chance<br />at gettin' some respect for us.
4303040 4306271 - Come on. I respect you!<br />- You can't respect me.
4306400 4309392 - Yes, I do.<br />- No, you can't! Don't tell me that.
4309520 4315038 All those beatings you took in the ring,<br />I took them with you. I know how you feel.
4315160 4319039 I know when somebody like Tommy<br />comes along, you feel alive.
4319160 4321594 But he's not you.<br />He doesn't have your heart.
4321720 4327033 All those fighters you beat, you beat 'em<br />with heart, not muscle. Mickey knew that.
4327160 4331517 That's why you and Mickey were special.<br />But Mickey's dead!
4331640 4336634 If there's something you wanna pass on,<br />pass it on to your son, for God's sakes!
4336760 4338830 Your son is lost.
4338960 4341155 He needs <i>you.</i>
4341280 4346559 I know Tommy makes you feel great. He<br />makes you feel like you're winning again.
4346680 4348910 But you're losing us!
4349040 4351713 Rocky, you're losing your family!
4358720 4360995 I'm sorry.
4361120 4365079 You know, it was always you and me.<br />It was always you and me.
4367400 4369356 I'm sorry, Adrian.
4371560 4373471 I don't know about you guys...
4374560 4376516 ...but I gotta get outta here.
4378120 4381351 - What do you say we go to the shore?<br />- Oh, yeah, great(!)
4381480 4383994 - How are we gonna get there?<br />- What do you mean?
4384120 4386714 We throw our thumbs<br />in the air and hitchhike.
4386840 4389354 - Uh, yo!<br />- Oh, what's he want?
4389480 4391948 - You want me to stay with you?<br />- No.
4392080 4395755 You're right. I got enough problems<br />with <i>my</i> old man. Come on.
4396720 4400679 - You ain't gonna hit him, are you?<br />- No, I ain't gonna hit him.
4402040 4404793 Yo, kid. When you start smokin'?
4404920 4410313 - I don't know. Didn't you ever smoke?<br />- Uh, yeah. I done a lot of bad things.
4410440 4412396 So?
4413600 4415989 So I... I wised up.
4416120 4418873 OK, so maybe I'll wise up someday too.
4420960 4425715 Maybe tonight's a good night<br />for both of us to start wisin' up.
4426680 4429194 - Don't worry about it.<br />- I gotta worry about it.
4429320 4431515 The deal was we were<br />supposed to be tight.
4431640 4434598 What about Tommy?<br />You're tight with him too, huh?
4435920 4437876 Tommy.
4441480 4443436 Yeah, well...
4444240 4446595 That was yesterday, you know?
4449920 4452070 You know, kid...
4452200 4455351 Remember you told me<br />a long time ago about deceptions?
4455480 4457835 And I was talking to you about scams?
4457960 4462238 I shoulda listened to you.<br />I was tryin' to teach you, all right?
4462360 4465158 But you were teachin' me<br />and I didn't wise up.
4465280 4469239 I didn't know and I made mistakes.<br />And I do things, you know...
4470800 4474349 It bothers me, you know?<br />I forget a lot of things and I...
4474480 4477233 I... just...
4487280 4489589 Hey, kid.
4490440 4493193 I know I made a few mistakes, you know?
4494120 4498591 But I would love to hang out<br />with you again. Just you and me.
4502440 4504476 I swear to God.
4504600 4507876 It's just gonna be you and me this time.
4509360 4511316 Home team?
4512800 4515678 Yeah. Home team.
4518600 4522275 - Hey, kid, you wanna hear a joke?<br />- Yeah, sure. Why not?
4522400 4524868 - Knock, knock.<br />- Who's there?
4525000 4527719 - Tuna fish.<br />- Tuna fish who?
4527840 4531674 You can tune a piano,<br />but you cannot tune a fish.
4531800 4535395 - Well, you're gettin' better.<br />- Yeah. That's a good one.
4541360 4545990 All right, folks. Lock the door and<br />hide the kids. It's time to wage war!

4853920 4856878 - Have a good time with Uncle Paulie.<br />- Yeah.
4863240 4867631 Let me present the newest, the youngest<br />heavyweight champion of all time...
4867760 4870115 ...Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!
4871560 4874791 - Do you think it was too easy?<br />- I took some shots, but I was never hurt.
4874920 4876876 I'm just glad to be the champ.
4877000 4881994 Don't you think this looked like more like<br />a sparring session than a championship?
4882120 4884953 - It didn't look like you broke a sweat.<br />- Very observant.
4885080 4887116 Union Cane wasn't feeling that good.
4887240 4891199 But Tommy Gunn would have done<br />the same thing if Union was 100%.
4891320 4894596 100%?! He fought like<br />he didn't have a heartbeat!
4894720 4896836 We all know Cane is a paper champion.
4896960 4900111 - What do you mean?<br />- Cane's title was manufactured.
4900240 4903391 - He never won it from Balboa.<br />- Gentlemen, give him a break.
4903520 4906512 Will you ever get out<br />from underneath Balboa's shadow?
4906640 4911794 - I won the title. What more do you want?<br />- You've gotta fight some real opponents.
4911920 4913956 But I beat the best tonight!
4914080 4917755 The best? This guy's a bum.<br />He doesn't even deserve a title shot.
4917880 4922795 Gentlemen, whoa! We're gettin' carried<br />away. Cane was the recognised champ.
4922920 4925593 We know the ratings system<br />can be manipulated.
4925720 4928393 Fact is, Tommy Gunn<br />beat a second-rate fighter...
4928520 4931876 ...with so much glass in his jaw,<br />he oughta be a chandelier.
4932000 4934468 This man will prove<br />to be a great champion!
4934600 4937956 He might win a few fights,<br />but a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.
4938080 4940036 No, he's no Rocky Balboa.
4940160 4943789 Let's face it. There's only one Balboa.<br />He was a true people's champion.
4944120 4947749 But in time Tommy Gunn may be<br />able to fill his shoes. Next question.
4947880 4951793 - Not by fighting stiffs like Cane, he won't!<br />- I'll fight anybody, anywhere!
4951920 4954434 When are you gonna fight a real fighter?
4954560 4959111 Gentlemen, come on. Thank you for<br />coming tonight. We look forward to...
4959240 4961196 Hey, Tommy, I got somethin' for ya.
4961320 4966758 For your next fight, try the redhead in the<br />front row. I hear she comes real cheap.
4966880 4970793 We look forward to seeing you<br />at Tommy Gunn's next fight.
4970920 4973480 Why did you say Balboa's better?<br />Do you believe that?
4973600 4976194 Of course not. Look, we can't talk in here.
4976320 4979278 <i>(reporter)</i> Who are you gonna<br />fight next, Tommy?
4979400 4983518 What the hell happened in there? I won<br />the damn title and they think I'm a bum!
4983640 4987030 - Why didn't you back me up?<br />- When the press is right, they're right.
4987160 4991312 I'm as good as Balboa ever was and<br />I'm tired of being called a damn robot!
4991440 4994910 Listen, Tommy. You can't fight the press.<br /><i>I</i> can't fight them.
4995040 4999272 As long as they got Balboa on the brain,<br />he's champ. He fought wars in the ring.
4999400 5001595 Tommy, face facts. You're in his shadow.
5001720 5003950 - This is your own man talking!<br />- Listen to me.
5004080 5008995 There is a way to get the respect<br />you deserve. Challenge Balboa to fight.
5009120 5013033 - George could set it up in just weeks.<br />- It'd be the greatest fight ever.
5013160 5016197 Teacher against student,<br />old lion against young lion.
5016320 5019357 That's the only way<br />you ever gonna get peace of mind.
5019480 5023712 That press will hound you with that man's<br />legend for as long as you wear gloves.
5023840 5028470 You gotta get him into that ring, Tommy,<br />or you'll keep hearing questions like that.
5028600 5032479 Then you'll start to ask <i>yourself</i><br />"Could I take him? Am I good enough?"
5032600 5034556 "Do people think I'm a carbon copy...
5034680 5039231 ...or a second-rate pretender who only<br />got a shot because of my skin tone?"
5039360 5041669 Got to challenge<br />that man to fight, Tommy.
5041800 5046510 If he refuses, you gotta insult him, you<br />gotta dog him, you gotta humiliate him!
5046640 5051589 Do whatever you got to do to get him into<br />that ring! But that's what you got to do.
5055600 5059388 <i>(Rocky)</i> OK. Blast off.<br />Rollin' silver. And down!
5059520 5061829 Andy, these flippers ain't flippin'.
5061960 5066192 - That machine cost me a fortune.<br />- It's costin' me a fortune too.
5066320 5068595 <i>- (Duke)</i> Rocky Balboa!<br />- <i>(Andy)</i> What was that?
5068960 5072430 Rocky Balboa! There's a man out here<br />wishin' to speak with you.
5072560 5074994 Rocky Balboa!
5076400 5078868 Rocko, you know who that is, huh?
5079000 5081150 Yeah, I know who that is.
5082920 5088472 - Rocky, you need some help?<br />- No, guys. It ain't no pie-eatin' contest.
5090800 5092870 <i>(Paulie)</i> Look what's in the street.
5093000 5096117 Tommy, what are you doin' here?<br />You oughta be celebratin'.
5096400 5099676 I'm challenging you to a fight.<br />Any time, any place, anywhere.
5099800 5101631 - Fight?<br />- That's right.
5101760 5105992 You're comin' here with these people<br />askin' if I wanna throw hands with you?
5106120 5109271 - Is that what this is about?<br />- Yeah. And I ain't nobody's robot.
5109400 5113837 Nobody's boy! Now are you accepting<br />the challenge or are you yellow?
5113960 5117873 He has no class. Come on, Rocko.<br />Hey, he has no class! Come on.
5127200 5130715 Hey, it ain't him. You wanna<br />shoot some eightball or somethin'?
5130840 5133752 Hey! I ain't through talkin' with you yet!
5133880 5136189 Look, I ain't got<br />no more to say to you, OK?
5136320 5140472 - I wanted good things for you.<br />- Like hell. You're only in it for the money.
5140600 5143194 I'm tired of walkin'<br />in your shadow like a robot!
5143320 5146232 You thought I was in this<br />for the money, Tommy?
5146360 5149079 We were supposed to be like brothers,<br />you know?
5149200 5151555 You don't know it,<br />but you got a deception here.
5151680 5155878 This guy was using you for the bait.<br />He wants to get you and me in the ring.
5156000 5159231 He wants us to fight each other<br />to make the money.
5159360 5162113 He don't care about you<br />and he don't care about me neither.
5162240 5165312 Come on. Enough of the fantasy.<br />Let's talk reality.
5165440 5168876 Rocky Balboa, are you prepared<br />to accept Tommy's challenge?
5169000 5173357 - Tommy...<br />- Hey! I would have taken you any time.
5173480 5176756 - You're a piece of garbage.<br />- This ain't none of your business.
5176880 5179872 - None of my business?<br />- Come on, Paulie. Forget it.
5180000 5183117 He spit blood for you,<br />put you ahead of his own family.
5183240 5186949 And you bring these rat bums<br />around here? Kill his dignity?
5187080 5190959 Rocko made you your shot.<br />He's the real champ. You're just a joke!
5191080 5193310 Get out of here before I break your face.
5195200 5197191 Paulie?
5198240 5201676 - Don't break your hand on that bum!<br />- Paulie, are you OK?
5201800 5205395 You shoulda left him on the street,<br />where you found him.
5206120 5209999 - Merlin, get him outta here. Get him out!<br />- Get off of me!
5213640 5216438 You knocked him down.<br />Why don't you try knockin' <i>me</i> down?
5216560 5220553 No, in the ring. Tommy Gunn only fights<br />in the ring! Let's get outta here.
5220680 5223877 - My ring's outside.<br />- Yeah? Let's do it.
5225440 5227556 Let's go live. Go live!
5233720 5237508 - He's a punk, Rocky.<br />- He's a street fighter. You a prizefighter.
5237640 5240074 - Don't be a damn fool.<br />- You don't own me!
5240200 5242668 - You don't own me!<br />- What's wrong? Take it easy.
5242800 5245633 Nobody does! I want my respect.
5245760 5248593 Well, come and get it. Come on, Tommy.
5259280 5261999 I loved you, man! Do you know that?
5262120 5265749 You and me, we were supposed<br />to be like this, Tommy.
5265880 5267836 You blew it! You...
5277640 5281838 Lucky punch. But I told you<br />never to fight a street fighter fight.
5281960 5285748 - Come on, let's get out of here.<br />- You're always a champ, Rocky. Great.
5321440 5323351 Great stuff. This is beautiful!
5323920 5326150 Mom! Mom! It's Dad!
5326280 5328510 - He's on TV. He's fighting!<br />- What?!
5329640 5331756 Come on, man! Come on!

5387120 5389395 Get up! Don't lay down.<br />Fight this guy hard.
5389520 5391511 Come on! Come on!

5416760 5420070 - One more round.<br />- Tommy, get back! Come on.
5420200 5422873 - You don't need this.<br />- You lose, you're finished!
5423000 5425434 I got one more round. Come on.
5425560 5429633 I'm not gonna knock you out this time.<br />I'm gonna put you through the street.
