854187 856456 I want to murder the bum<br />worse than anybody.
856523 858358 Hey, Adrian, what's wrong?
858425 860260 Look what you done now.
860327 861694 She's dumpin' everything<br />on me.
861761 863530 Oh, come on, Paulie.<br />Don't turn this around on me.
863596 864998 Oh, come on,<br />what'd you do, Paulie?
865065 868969 He gave power... Power of<br />attorney to our accountant.<br />What?
869036 872005 I just didn't gave anything<br />to nobody, huh?
872072 873806 He sent a letter!
873873 875708 He says... He says we're gonna<br />be in Russia a couple<br />of months. He says,
875775 878378 "And I need Rocky to sign<br />a tax extension!"
878445 882149 Not extension!<br />That was a power<br />of attorney, Paulie!
882215 885318 He's the thief!<br />I need alcohol.
885385 888121 Rocky, on my eyes,<br />I never stole a freakin' dime.
889122 891291 Adrian, what's happenin' here?
891358 892625 Huh?<br />It's gone.
892692 894127 What's gone?
894194 895963 The money. The money.
896029 898498 Everything. It's all gone.
898565 900367 LAWYER: The piece of paper<br />Paulie had you sign
900433 902936 wasn't a request<br />for an extension<br />on your tax returns.
903003 907107 It was a blanket<br />power of attorney<br />in favor of the accountant,
907174 910110 who was involved in<br />some very high-priced<br />commercial real estate.
910177 912379 He thought he could<br />flip it quick,<br />take his profit,
912445 914514 have your money back<br />before you knew it was gone.
914581 917284 And unfortunately for you<br />and everybody in this room,
917350 920087 his deals fell through<br />because the market dried up.
920153 921955 And you lost millions.
922022 924091 (STUTTERING) So, what are<br />you sayin'? There ain't<br />nothin' I can do about it?
924157 926193 I'm doing plenty.<br />I've filed eight criminal acts<br />against him,
926259 929029 but you've got<br />tremendous debt payment<br />on this property, Rocky.
929096 931364 You didn't pay<br />your tax returns<br />in six years,
931431 933700 and the mortgage on your house<br />hasn't been paid in months.
933766 935802 Wait, we didn't<br />have a mortgage.
935868 937270 Our house was<br />fully paid for.
937337 938771 Don't take it from me,<br />ask him.
938838 942442 Apparently not.<br />There's nearly $400,000<br />still outstanding.
942509 944544 The only thing you have<br />that's not encumbered
944611 946413 is a gymnasium that was<br />willed to your son
946479 949516 by a Mickey Goldmill<br />in 1982.
949582 952152 You can sell some things.<br />Remember those commercials<br />you did?
952219 954587 You know, Paulie,<br />I ain't no commercial<br />kind of guy.
954654 956656 I'm a fighter.<br />It's what I do for a living.
956723 959226 LAWYER: Nah, it's just<br />as well. We couldn't get<br />any sponsors.
959292 961261 With the investigation<br />of the accountant,
961328 964731 out pops a criminal record<br />of Rocky's for assault in<br />connection with loan-sharking.
964797 967434 But that was...<br />It was a long time ago.<br />He didn't know what...
967500 969269 Why not a couple<br />of more fights?
969336 972005 With your popularity<br />right now, you could be<br />out of this thing in no time.
972072 974507 No, he's retiring.<br />Rocko, fighting's<br />the ticket.
974574 976476 I said he's retired!
976543 978411 Paulie, we're here<br />because of you!
978478 981281 Ah... I'm not takin' the heat<br />for all this.
981348 983083 I thought I was doin'<br />smart business.
983150 985085 You thought you did<br />smart business?
985152 986953 Hey, you...<br />Me?
987020 988021 What are you talking about me?<br />The accountant<br />was your choice!
988088 990023 My choice?
990090 991991 You should have known<br />he was a thief,<br />but you're never awake
992059 993793 because you live in this<br />fairy-tale world<br />where the air don't move.
993860 995262 Oh, Paulie...<br />You're like a season<br />that don't change!
995328 996596 Hey, you don't talk<br />to her like this.
996663 998565 I'm not no tomato can<br />you kick around!
998631 999966 Paulie, no!<br />Yeah!
1000033 1001034 You call Duke.
1001101 1002469 You tell him I'll fight Cane.
1002535 1004271 I don't care,<br />anywhere, anytime.
1004337 1005572 No, Rocky.<br />If that's what you want,
1005638 1007707 I'll get on it right away.<br />No. No.
1007774 1009609 Rocky, Rocky, please.
1009676 1011644 We can't go down like this.<br />A couple of fights,<br />we're out of trouble, Adrian.
1011711 1014247 Yeah, but you said<br />you wouldn't.<br />No... I didn't say anything.
1014314 1015548 Look, did we come<br />this far to lose it?
1015615 1017217 Well, you know,<br />you have to see a doctor.
1017284 1019652 Adrian, I don't need<br />to see no doctor.<br />I need to get a promoter.
1019719 1021288 Hey, you know,<br />you gotta see a doctor.
1021354 1023022 If he says it's all right,<br />I'll support anything<br />you wanna do.
1023090 1025658 I gotta fight, okay?<br />I got problems. I gotta fight.
1026526 1027994 Will you do it for me?
1030463 1032965 All right, for you.
1033032 1036169 DOCTOR: Because of<br />the continuous violent blows<br />to the head,
1036236 1040707 you've developed a condition<br />particular to boxers called<br />cavum septum pellucidum,
1040773 1044211 which is a hole<br />in the membrane<br />separating the ventricles.
1044277 1048215 The brain's surface neurons<br />in this area have<br />also been traumatized.
1048281 1050817 Excuse me, Doctor.<br />Simply stated, Mr. Balboa,
1050883 1053886 it means that you've suffered<br />some damage to the brain.
1053953 1055922 ADRIAN: How long<br />until he recovers?
1055988 1057590 The effects are<br />irreversible.
1058391 1059926 Oh, I...
1059992 1062629 Rocky,<br />you have to retire.
1062695 1063996 Adrian, I don't<br />want to retire.
1064063 1065832 You know, this ain't<br />the time to retire.
1065898 1068935 No, not in here,<br />not in no office.
1069001 1071171 I just fought<br />the best fight of my life.
1071238 1072872 I just did that, you know,
1074207 1076743 and all I need is<br />a couple more.
1076809 1079379 No, Rocky, you suffered<br />severe brain trauma.
1079446 1081281 Well, he could be wrong.<br />Anybody could be wrong.
1081348 1084417 I don't think he is.<br />He ain't God. Look, Adrian,<br />only God ain't wrong.
1084484 1086986 Hey, Rocky,<br />this is what's good for you.
1087053 1088788 All I need is<br />a couple easy ones, right?
1088855 1090990 Not with the way it is.<br />You can't get licensed<br />in any state.
1091057 1093526 He can't get<br />licensed anywhere, Doctor?
1093593 1095262 That is correct.
1095328 1097897 Rocky, do you love me?
1097964 1099966 (BREATHING HEAVILY)
1100032 1102068 Yeah, I love you.<br />Why you ask that?
1102135 1104704 Because if you love somebody,
1104771 1106806 you live with them,<br />you live for them.
1106873 1108908 You don't gamble<br />with a life.
1108975 1111944 Rocky, I don't care<br />about the money, it's you.
1113079 1114747 That's all that matters.
1116483 1118418 Please. We'll be okay.
1119386 1120820 We'll be fine.
1124857 1126659 (WHISPERING)
1127760 1128861 ADRIAN: Uh...

1766498 1769401 Well, a scam is<br />like a hustle.
1769468 1770870 PAULIE: He don't get it.

1777910 1781047 Yeah, he had<br />a nice head.<br />Welcome back.
1781113 1783749 So, anyway,<br />like a hustle's related<br />to a con, you know?
1783816 1785885 PAULIE: He don't get it.<br />ROCKY JR.: A deception.
1785952 1788187 Excuse me?<br />You're saying beware<br />of deceptions.

1804136 1807673 I'll tell you somethin',<br />this place is blight new,<br />you know?

1809775 1811978 this place could be<br />okay again.<br />What do you think?
1812044 1813980 I don't know. Anyway,<br />we're gonna be late<br />for school. Come on.
1814046 1816849 Hey, Paulie,<br />I wanna talk to the kid<br />private, like, you know,
1816916 1819185 man to smaller man,<br />all right?<br />Right. Like I got no feelings.

1837669 1840306 So you gotta stay very,<br />very sharp around here.
1840372 1842074 I intend to.
1842141 1846245 "Intend." You know,<br />sometimes you make me feel<br />very stupid.
1846312 1849982 Why?<br />Why? 'Cause you're smarter<br />than me, and that's a fact.
1850049 1851683 No, I'm not.<br />Yeah, you are.
1851750 1853886 It's like every day<br />you learn something new,
1853953 1855821 and every day<br />I forget something new,
1855888 1857623 but listen. Listen to me.
1857689 1860226 We're in this thing together,<br />so if you can<br />figure out any way
1860292 1862794 on how to fix things up,<br />don't be afraid to tell me,
1862861 1865764 'cause we gotta stick<br />together, 'cause what are we?

1869535 1870903 Oh. Oh, home team.
1870970 1872838 Home team! You know,<br />you got that right.
1872905 1875641 You know, I used to go to<br />this school when I was a kid.<br />You know. Nice bricks.
1875707 1878911 Used to have good milk<br />at lunch and everything.<br />It was real tough then,
1878978 1881647 but I think you can handle it,<br />don't you think?
1881713 1884683 KID: No way,<br />you don't even know<br />what you're talking about.
1884750 1886652 If you went here,<br />I can go here.
1887719 1889088 I'm not scared, really.
1890222 1892258 Really?
1892324 1894760 Well, I guess<br />I'm a little scared.
1894826 1896195 But that's normal,<br />don't you think?
1896262 1898597 Oh, yeah. You know,<br />I had 72 fights comin' up,
1898664 1900099 and every one of 'em<br />I was scared.

1916115 1918584 Goodness gracious.<br />Where'd this come from?
1918650 1921920 It's a strange place<br />to stash your lunch money,<br />don't you think?
1921988 1924190 Ah, it's just<br />a lunch joke, you know?
1924256 1928027 Thanks, Dad.<br />Okay, listen.<br />I'll see you later.

1935134 1937803 And don't mess<br />with nobody's girlfriend.
1937869 1939405 They don't like that<br />around here.
1946312 1948647 ROCKY: You know, Paulie,<br />I'm really worried<br />about the kid.
1948714 1950382 You know, he ain't<br />used to living like this.
1950449 1952284 He don't know<br />the streets or nothing.
1952351 1954886 And that school,<br />I know exactly<br />what's gonna happen.
1954953 1957856 Some wise guy's gonna come up<br />to him 'cause he's my kid.
1957923 1960026 He's just gonna come out<br />and try to bang him out,
1960092 1962995 give him a cheap shot,<br />you know? I mean... Jeez.
1963062 1964196 Mr. Balboa?<br />Yeah?
1964263 1965497 How you doin'?<br />My name's Tommy Gunn.
1965564 1966765 Yeah, how you doin'?
1966832 1968534 Well, with a name like that,<br />you better be tough.
1968600 1970302 Yeah, very true.<br />It ain't easy.
1970369 1971703 Anyway, I come<br />from Oklahoma.
1971770 1973639 Welcome.<br />I have an amateur's record<br />of 45-to-one.
1973705 1976208 Uh-huh.<br />And I turned pro at 18,<br />and I had eight fights.
1976275 1978177 You're a fighter?<br />Yeah, I'm a fighter.
1978244 1980946 Got it.<br />And now that I'm 20, I'd just<br />like to show you what I got.
1981013 1982814 Well, I...<br />I mean, I've saved up<br />about 400 bucks.
1982881 1984350 Mr. Rocky Balboa.<br />I could pay you for training.
1984416 1985617 Yeah... What?
1985684 1987253 Excuse me, young man,<br />I have some business here.
1987319 1988820 What, is he lost<br />or what?<br />Huh? Thank you.
1988887 1990622 Good to see you, again,<br />friend. How you doin'?<br />Yeah. How you doin'?
1990689 1992658 DUKE: My health is fine.<br />What more could<br />a man ask for?
1992724 1994893 PAULIE: Money and hair.<br />Listen, I gotta go<br />to work now.
1994960 1997096 What? Where? Here?<br />In a sweat box?<br />Yeah.
1997163 1998397 Can't be good for the image.
1998464 1999898 Urban light.<br />What are you gonna do?
1999965 2001367 Hey, Rocky, Rocky...<br />What'd you say?
2001433 2003602 Urban light.<br />It's "blight." Urban blight.
2003669 2006172 Rock, George would like you<br />to consider putting on<br />those damn gloves again.
2006238 2008006 It's a hell of a payday.
2008074 2009608 Well, you know,<br />I'm officially expired.
2009675 2011143 No, you do have<br />marquis value.
2011210 2012811 You put butts in the buckets,<br />asses in the seats.
2012878 2014480 A businessman<br />with any sort of brain
2014546 2016715 don't retire when he can still<br />pull in the bread, baby.
2016782 2018984 'Cause only in America<br />do we get these kind<br />of opportunities.
2019051 2021387 Union Cane's goin'<br />for the title on the 14th.<br />Uh-huh.
2021453 2023289 Yeah, here's some tickets.<br />Be our guests.
2023355 2025591 We have a strong feeling<br />about this one.<br />Think he's gonna take it.
2025657 2028827 That's the time<br />to challenge.<br />Because people love comebacks,
2028894 2031230 and there's nothin'<br />in the boxing business<br />more commercial
2031297 2035101 than a long-shot comeback<br />of a down-on-his-luck,<br />pure snow-white underdog.
2035167 2036768 Now, like your<br />Mark Twain once said,
2036835 2039305 "Virtue has never been<br />as respectable as money."
2039371 2040872 Who's Twain?<br />He was a painter.
2040939 2043575 Look, simply put,<br />you're the great white hope.
2043642 2045744 You mean great white dope.<br />No, forget it.<br />No, no, Rock, Rock...
2045811 2048880 I ain't emotionally...<br />Hey, hold it.<br />Hold the bullshit.
2048947 2050882 I know what the problem is.<br />You think I was born<br />yesterday?
2050949 2052651 Merlin, show him the paper.
2052718 2054220 Now, this is your<br />medical report.
2054286 2056288 It's not so good,<br />but we can work around it.
2056355 2058690 Where'd you get this?<br />It really doesn't matter,<br />does it, Rock?
2058757 2060659 You agree to fight Cane,<br />and George here can guarantee
2060726 2062328 you get licensed<br />in any country<br />around the world.
2062394 2064029 Guaranteed.<br />You can do this?
2064096 2066865 No problem.<br />His comeback's in the bag<br />and worth millions.
2066932 2069335 The time is hot,<br />the deal is hot. <i>Caliente!</i>
2069401 2071103 We could use<br />one more payday.<br />I agree!
2071170 2072804 Adrian, where'd you<br />come from?
2072871 2074039 I didn't think you<br />were going to...<br />Oh...
2074106 2076041 Mrs. Balboa just appeared.<br />This woman is magic.
2076108 2077909 Look, I don't think<br />you're very funny.
2077976 2079678 Are you trying<br />to talk my husband<br />into fighting again?
2079745 2081280 We're talkin' business,<br />now, darlin'.
2081347 2083182 Do you like feelin' hard up?
2083249 2085951 Do you like reachin'<br />in your pocket<br />and only feelin' your leg?
2086017 2088120 Well, do you?<br />I didn't think so.
2088187 2091657 I'm offering you<br />your last golden opportunity<br />to dump this loser image.
2091723 2093091 Who you talkin' to?
2093159 2095194 Hey, Adrian, you weren't<br />workin' across...
2095261 2097463 Hey, whoa, what the hell<br />are you two people<br />talkin' about? Huh?
2097529 2099198 This is<br />a tremendous opportunity.
2099265 2100532 Opportunity for who?
2100599 2103169 For you to make money?<br />For him to be disabled?
2103235 2105137 What would you do<br />if the choices were reversed?
2106172 2108507 You have to think about that.
2108574 2111777 Rocky, they don't care<br />about you.
2111843 2114079 You want to get serious?<br />Let's get serious.
2114146 2116782 You represent the dreams<br />of the long shots,<br />the little people.
2116848 2120352 The never-wills identify<br />with you, and identification<br />is the key to public success.
2120419 2123455 You're a true champion,<br />a true product of the people.<br />Now sell it.
2123522 2125291 Sell it while there are<br />still buyers.
2125357 2127559 They ain't gonna last forever.<br />You say you're a fighter?<br />Then fight!
2127626 2129528 You say you want<br />a champion's do, then do it
2129595 2132164 and I'll make you<br />so much money<br />you could swim in it!
2132231 2133865 You can swim,<br />can't you, darlin'?
2133932 2135634 What do you say?<br />Come on. Put it there.
2135701 2137403 It's time to put some hustle<br />behind this muscle.
2137469 2140372 He's done!<br />He's done fighting!
2147479 2149748 You're a damn fool.
2151183 2154186 Maybe we ought to<br />sign Mrs. Balboa<br />to fight Cane, huh?
2154253 2156822 Looks like she's the one<br />with the <i>cojones</i><br />in the family.
2159891 2163061 Yo, you don't talk<br />like that in front of my wife,<br />you know?
2163128 2165030 That ain't no<br />park bench, boy.
2169134 2170502 I'll get him.
2170569 2172938 (STUTTERING)<br />Rocky, I'm really sorry.<br />I didn't wanna...
2173004 2176141 Hey, you guys want<br />privacy now?<br />I'll be upstairs.
2180279 2181347 Rocky...
2182648 2184916 Rocky, I'm sorry. I... I...
2184983 2187185 But, you know,<br />it just takes one bad hit,
2187253 2188487 and you could be an invalid.
2188554 2190522 Well, I feel like an invalid<br />already, Adrian.
2190589 2192057 Why'd you<br />gotta come back here?
2192123 2195026 You're too smart<br />for this place here.<br />I got nothin' to do.
2195093 2196895 Gloria. I called Gloria.
2196962 2199698 She said, you know,<br />she could use some<br />part-time help.
2199765 2201333 Yeah, but why do you wanna<br />do this, Adrian?
2201400 2203469 Why do you wanna<br />go back to the same place<br />you started from?
2203535 2205437 I gotta do it,<br />but you don't gotta do it!
2205504 2208974 I wanted to be there<br />so I could be close to you.
2218417 2219951 All right. Yeah.
2220018 2222120 You know, it's gettin'<br />a little cold out here.<br />Maybe...
2222187 2225056 Okay. Maybe you better<br />get inside, okay?<br />I understand.
2225123 2227058 Are you all right?<br />What?
2227125 2229728 Are you all right?<br />Yeah, I'm all right.<br />I'm fine.
2229795 2231563 Hey, it's gettin' cold, okay?
2237969 2240171 Yo, Adrian!
2240238 2242073 Did we ever leave this place?
2242140 2244443 (TRAIN CLATTERING)
2244510 2246244 I don't know!
2251817 2254486 Hey, mind if I talk<br />to you now?
2254553 2256855 My head's a little busy<br />right now.
2268834 2270168 George, I don't know<br />if you're gonna get him.
2270235 2271937 This guy, Balboa, he don't<br />think straight anymore.
2272003 2274105 None of these bums<br />think straight,<br />but all I need is an angle.
2274172 2275907 I'll fight Balboa right now.<br />Hey...
2275974 2277443 I'm better than<br />Balboa ever was.
2277509 2278844 Hey, hey!

2485250 2486518 Hey, look.
2486585 2489020 Goin' easy don't mean<br />breakin' bones, kid.
2489087 2490622 Man, I'm sorry.<br />But what do you think?
2490689 2493224 What do I think?<br />I don't think<br />you listen too good.
2493291 2496261 But you fight, you brawl<br />like you was a street fighter,
2496327 2497829 and I know somethin'<br />about that.
2497896 2500398 But this is called boxing.<br />This ain't no mugging,<br />you know?
2500465 2502133 I'm sorry.<br />But I know I can do it all.
2502200 2504369 Yeah? Well,<br />not on this date, okay?
2505336 2506605 That's it?
2506672 2508439 Hey, yo, I gotta work<br />with these kids here.
2508506 2509875 You guys get ready.<br />We're going one more.
2509941 2511877 How about you try<br />to manage me?
2511943 2515146 Manage?<br />Yeah, unless you think<br />I ain't got nothin' goin'.
2516214 2517916 You ain't got nothin' goin'.
2517983 2520586 Yeah, all right,<br />you got a lot goin'.<br />You got a lot of tools.
2520652 2523388 But I ain't no manager.<br />I ain't never been man...
2523454 2526524 You know, the gentleman<br />that owned this place,<br />that was a manager.
2526592 2531062 But, me, I was always<br />the managed... Guy.
2531129 2533464 Hey, look.<br />Good luck, all right?
2536234 2537703 All right, guys.<br />Let's go.
2538904 2540105 Come on, move around.

2556722 2558323 All right, you guys, come on.
2558389 2560358 No cheap shots.<br />Move it around.
2567733 2568967 How you doin'?
2569968 2573571 Cold? You look cold.
2573639 2576241 I guess it has somethin'<br />to do with the weather.
2577843 2579577 Here, take my coat.
2580245 2581847 No, thanks.
2581913 2583181 Where's your boyfriend?

2584650 2586952 Him. Forget it.<br />He ain't got no manners.
2588820 2591156 I'm Jewel,<br />if you wanna know.
2593158 2594592 I'm Robert.
2595126 2597796 Hi.
2597863 2600465 Well, I been livin' here<br />about six years now.
2600531 2601532 (LAUGHS)
2601599 2603601 It ain't Disneyland.
2603669 2606504 You been to Disneyland?<br />Sure.
2606571 2609407 You make it sound<br />like everybody has.
2609474 2611309 I know you can't tell<br />by the way I look,
2611376 2614880 but I ain't like<br />the other kids<br />around here.
2614946 2617849 Why? I mean,<br />what makes you<br />so different?
2617916 2620051 I don't know.<br />I guess it's 'cause<br />I wanna get out.
2620118 2621920 You know how it is.
2623421 2626925 Hmm, you know,<br />for an Italian kid,
2626992 2628559 you ain't got a bad butt.
2630028 2631596 BOY: Shut up, man.<br />Let's go. Come on.
2637568 2639938 PAULIE: First money I get,<br />I'm goin' to Miami.
2640005 2641206 Why Miami?
2641272 2643241 Miami needs new gigolos.
2643308 2645777 Yeah, I read<br />somethin' like that.
2645844 2646912 Ow.
2648613 2650181 My back is gettin' bad.
2650248 2652250 How come you don't<br />have arthritis?
2652317 2653518 Yo, ain't I got enough?
2653584 2655220 MAN: Hey,<br />watch where you're going.
2655286 2658156 Adrian's too good<br />for this.
2658223 2660692 This place is really<br />depressing, Paulie,<br />you know? It's...
2660759 2662293 Yo, Rock,<br />come inside.
2662360 2663829 Everybody's been<br />askin' for you.<br />You too, Paulie.
2663895 2667132 Hey, no, thanks.<br />I'm a little beat.<br />I'm a little thirsty.
2667198 2668633 Hey, you go<br />if you want to, Paulie.
2668700 2671169 Mr. Balboa?<br />Look at this. Tommy Gunn.
2671236 2673204 Yo, why you still<br />hangin' around, kid?
2673271 2674906 Is there somethin'<br />I can do for you?
2674973 2677843 Yeah. I'd like<br />to try again.
2677909 2679811 Hey, kid, you know,<br />I'd like to help you out,
2679878 2682180 but I really don't know<br />nothin' about no managing.
2682247 2683715 All I'm askin' for<br />is a chance.
2683782 2685383 Man, if I screw up<br />or do somethin'<br />you don't like,
2685450 2687118 man, you don't have<br />to throw me out.<br />Hell, I'll leave.
2687185 2688419 What have you got to lose?
2688486 2690255 Me? Nothin'.<br />I ain't got nothin' to lose.
2690321 2692758 It's what you got to lose.<br />And I got nothin' to lose.
2692824 2694425 Maybe you do. Like, look,
2694492 2697395 what if I don't<br />do good, right? You know,<br />and you don't make it?
2697462 2700631 I don't want you blamin' me<br />for this, kid, you know?
2700698 2703401 You know, here's what<br />I would do if I was you.<br />No, listen to me.
2703468 2705403 If I was you,<br />here's what I would do.
2705470 2708173 I would go home,<br />and I'd talk<br />to your family people.
2708239 2710375 Maybe you could come up with<br />somethin' better, you know?
2710441 2711777 I got no family people.
2711843 2713644 Man, all I got is<br />what you see here.
2713711 2715313 Man, I know<br />everything about you
2715380 2717182 from back when... When you had<br />your first fight<br />with Apollo Creed.
2717248 2718917 Yeah.<br />I mean, I read how nobody<br />cared about you,
2718984 2720485 how no one ever<br />gave you a chance.
2720551 2722520 And I realize<br />I don't come from<br />the same streets as you do,
2722587 2724522 but I'm hungry<br />like you were.
2724589 2727025 And ever since I put<br />on gloves, I've been<br />waitin' to meet you,
2727092 2730195 'cause I knew that<br />if anybody could make<br />me a winner, it was you.
2731229 2733231 Winner. Hey, Paulie,
2733298 2734465 you see a<br />winner standin' here?
2734532 2736467 Yes! Man, you beat the best!
2736534 2738169 Nobody could<br />ever say any different.
2738236 2740205 Look, Rock,<br />you don't know me,
2740271 2742407 but anything<br />you want me to do,<br />I'll do.
2742473 2745043 And if I can't,<br />I'll bust my butt trying.
2745110 2746577 Man, I'm not<br />hustlin' you, man.
2746644 2748646 All I'm askin' for<br />is a chance.<br />Mmm.
2748713 2750181 Man, just one shot.
2761092 2762693 Are you hungry?
2764695 2765831 Yeah.
2766264 2767398 Yeah?
2768033 2769700 Come on.
2769767 2772270 You're really gonna like<br />the way Adrian cooks,<br />you know.
2772337 2776307 She does, like,<br />amazing things with macaroni,<br />especially tomatoes.
2776374 2777775 But I gotta warn you.
2777843 2780045 She can be a little<br />vicious with the garlic.
2780111 2782513 (CHUCKLES)
2782580 2785050 So, why'd this kid<br />smack your face for, huh?
2785116 2786617 It really doesn't<br />matter, Dad.<br />Sorry...
2786684 2789387 Hell, sure, it matters.<br />It does matter.<br />They took his coat.
2789454 2790922 No. They...<br />Look, I don't<br />want the coat.
2790989 2792457 They took the one<br />with the collar?
2792523 2794025 ADRIAN: I'm gonna go<br />to your school tomorrow<br />and just...
2794092 2795660 Yeah, you should.<br />You'll only make<br />things worse if you go.
2795726 2796962 Can't I do what I think<br />is right?
2797028 2798729 Well, you know,<br />what do you think is right?
2798796 2800565 A baseball bat across<br />the face would be nice.
2800631 2801967 Paulie, what are you<br />tellin' this kid?
2802033 2804502 Adrian, can I have the plate?<br />I'm sorry, yes, Rocky.
2804569 2806872 You know,<br />I had trouble one time<br />when I was in school.
2806938 2809140 It seemed like every day<br />I got chased by this one kid,
2809207 2811342 till one day my mother<br />said to me, she said,
2811409 2813111 "Just pretend<br />the guy's like a balloon."
2813178 2814612 Balloon?
2814679 2817382 She said if you pop him hard,<br />these guys just go away.
2817448 2819017 (TOMMY CHUCKLING)
2820085 2822720 Tommy, we're trying<br />to raise our son
2822787 2825023 so he can handle<br />his problems with his mind,
2825090 2826858 not his muscles.
2826925 2829227 Sorry.<br />That's why<br />I'm gonna get mangled.
2829294 2831296 No, you ain't<br />gonna get mangled.
2831362 2833064 Dad, will you teach me<br />how to fight?
2833131 2834866 PAULIE: A baseball bat<br />would be nice.
2834933 2837802 Come on.<br />Do you want to grow up<br />and just use your fists?
2837869 2840371 You know, Adrian,<br />I don't think it<br />would be so bad
2840438 2843274 if I taught him<br />how to throw a few
2843341 2844709 deadly punches, you know.
2844775 2846811 Tommy, did your Dad<br />teach you how to fight?
2846878 2849514 Uh, no, not exactly.<br />I had to...<br />What?
2849580 2851849 Come on, sweetheart,<br />don't get personal.<br />No, it's okay.
2851917 2855020 See, my old man, he used<br />to drink a lot, seriously.
2855086 2857422 He'd go out with his friends<br />and tie one on,
2857488 2859224 then he'd come home<br />and look to punch on me.
2859290 2861492 You know, he'd punch<br />on my mother, too.
2861559 2863461 He did that a lot of times.
2863528 2865563 You know, so, growing up,<br />I never really thought<br />about fighting anybody
2865630 2866864 but my father.
2866932 2870001 You know, when I was 13,<br />I got in trouble at school.
2870068 2873638 He tied me down<br />and he whipped me so bad<br />I couldn't walk for a week.
2873704 2875073 Just couldn't do anything.
2875140 2876707 (CLEARS THROAT)
2876774 2879244 But, I tell you,<br />the first guy I ever<br />knocked out was my father.
2879310 2882948 And now when I get<br />in the ring,<br />it's like all I see is him.
2883014 2885883 That's kind of sick, huh?
2885951 2889487 Hey, yo, Tommy.<br />At least you had an old man<br />to knock out, you know.
2892023 2893124 Yeah.
2894525 2896494 Some of us didn't even<br />have that, you know?
2896561 2898396 Yeah, someday you could<br />punch out your pop.
2898463 2901432 Hey, yo, Paulie,<br />what are you tellin'<br />the kid things like this?
2901499 2903401 Hey, it's fittest<br />of the survival.
2904435 2905736 Hey, Tommy,
2905803 2907572 where you stayin' tonight?<br />You got a place?
2907638 2910208 Oh, uh, I'll find someplace<br />to stay. I mean...
2910275 2912777 No, I tell you,<br />we got room down<br />in the basement.
2912843 2914612 It's not... It's nice,<br />I don't know.
2914679 2917215 What about me?<br />Wait, now, sweetheart. Your<br />son is sleeping down there.
2917282 2919850 No, well, he can stay<br />with his uncle, right?
2919917 2921452 What the hell am I?<br />A pit stop?
2921519 2923354 ROCKY: No...<br />Hey, I don't want<br />to cause any problems.
2923421 2924689 I mean, I can find<br />someplace to stay.
2924755 2926357 No, it's okay.<br />You know, it's just
2926424 2929527 for a little while,<br />you know, right?
2929594 2931296 No problem at all.<br />You know,<br />it'll be all right.
2931362 2934032 Hey, kid, I appreciate it.<br />Is that all right?<br />It's cold outside.
2934099 2935400 Hey, I'm not<br />changin' no sheets.
2935466 2938703 Hey, since when<br />have you ever?
2938769 2940171 Hey, Tommy,<br />why don't you come<br />on down
2940238 2942607 and we'll show you<br />the whole place?
2942673 2943908 Sweetheart, why don't you<br />go downstairs,
2943975 2946911 show your Father<br />what you did today?<br />Come on. Come on.
2951516 2954019 Hey, junior, your plumbin'<br />don't leak, do it?
2956921 2958523 (CHUCKLES)
2958589 2960125 (SIGHS)
2961726 2964429 You know this guy?<br />Yeah. He hits hard.
2967232 2969134 TOMMY: You know, Adrian, man,<br />she can really cook.
2969200 2971269 ROCKY: Yeah, she's okay.
2971336 2974572 Listen, Tommy,<br />we ain't had a chance to get<br />this place too nice, so...

3015080 3017782 fightin' is like,<br />90% in the skull
3017848 3020485 and 10% in the body.<br />This is what he says to me.

3038303 3040338 Right, well, yeah.<br />Uh, Eric Elder.
3040405 3044509 No, no, no.<br />No, your best friend is<br />a guy named Frankie Fear.
3044575 3047312 You see,<br />fear is a fighter's<br />best friend.
3047378 3049347 You know,<br />but it ain't nothin'<br />to be ashamed of.
3049414 3051082 See, fear keeps you sharp,
3051149 3052717 it keeps you awake,
3052783 3054485 you know,<br />it makes you want to survive.<br />You know what I mean?
3054552 3057922 But the thing is,<br />you gotta learn<br />how to control it. All right?
3057988 3059890 'Cause fear is like<br />this fire, all right?
3059957 3061726 And it's burnin' deep inside.
3061792 3063694 Now, if you<br />control it, Tommy,
3063761 3065130 it's gonna make you hot.

4241070 4242272 No friction.
4242972 4244774 Only harmony, huh?
4244841 4247110 It's time to put some<br />hustle behind this muscle.
4247176 4250880 Why, our Tommy boy here's got<br />a little something personal<br />to discuss with you.
4250947 4252982 So I'm gonna be<br />sayin' good night.
4253049 4254250 Merry Christmas.
4254318 4255885 KAREN: Merry Christmas to you.
4255952 4258722 See you soon, huh?<br />Bye.
4258788 4260390 Sorry I'm late.<br />I ended up<br />having dinner.
4260457 4261825 Let's go.
4261891 4263693 Hey, that's okay,<br />Tommy, you know,
4263760 4266663 Adrian cooked something,<br />but it's probably<br />all cold now.
4266730 4269232 What we can do is make<br />sandwiches. It's no big...
4269299 4270834 Rocky, I don't wanna<br />make sandwiches.
4270900 4274137 I don't wanna make... No.<br />Tommy, why did you bring<br />him here?
4274203 4275839 He just wanted<br />to come by.
4275905 4277774 Oh, Tommy...<br />Rocky, do you mind<br />if I talk to you outside
4277841 4279075 about a few things?
4279142 4281244 Oh, yeah, sure.
4281311 4283947 It's getting late.<br />We have to be there<br />by 10:00.
4284013 4285782 (WHISPERING) Rocky.<br />No, it's okay.
4288184 4289719 (DOOR CLOSES)
4289786 4292422 Hey, Tommy,<br />what did you wanna<br />talk to me about?
4292489 4294658 Isn't it a<br />long drive?<br />Yeah.
4294724 4297126 So, uh, what do<br />you think?
4297193 4298495 Well, where'd you<br />get this from?
4298562 4299796 Duke gave<br />it to me.
4299863 4301931 Tommy!
4301998 4304267 Hey, you know, maybe you<br />ought to give this thing<br />back, you know, Tom.
4304334 4306670 And I knew it.<br />I knew you were<br />gonna say that.
4306736 4309873 Give it back? Why?<br />I mean, the guy likes<br />the way I fight.
4309939 4311808 It's almost 10:00.<br />All right.<br />We'll make it.
4311875 4314844 I know, but, you know,<br />you see what he's doing, here,<br />Tommy?
4314911 4317681 Hey, don't let him<br />put nothin' between us,<br />okay?
4317747 4319683 We got something<br />good going here.<br />"Put"? Like what?
4319749 4321851 I mean, the guy was<br />just talking about<br />gettin' a shot...
4321918 4324187 But we don't need him,<br />you know what I mean?
4324253 4326055 I mean,<br />you're gonna<br />get a shot.
4326122 4328091 You're gonna be able to buy<br />10 of these things here.
4328157 4329859 Rock, when you gonna<br />wake up, man?
4329926 4331528 We're watchin'<br />the parade go by.
4331595 4334230 (STAMMERING) What parade?<br />What are you<br />talking about?
4334297 4336332 What parade?<br />The big time.
4336400 4338001 Man, the way I'm going,<br />I'm not gonna get a shot<br />at the title for a long time.
4338067 4339536 Now, listen, Tommy...<br />And I've got<br />a perfect record.
4339603 4342372 I'm 22 and 0.<br />Where's the money? Where?
4342439 4344641 Man, we haven't made<br />any serious money yet.
4344708 4345909 And we won't<br />without the man.
4345975 4347276 I ain't talkin'<br />about the money.
4347343 4348745 Look, the money is gonna<br />be there, but lis...
4348812 4350246 I'm talkin' about<br />your rep, Tommy.
4350313 4352816 Look, don't sell out. Don't.<br />We don't need this guy.
4352882 4356052 Listen, Duke is<br />a wonderful man.<br />Put the top up.
4356119 4357654 Hey, forget about<br />the top, would you?
4357721 4359456 I'm signing papers<br />with the man tomorrow.
4359523 4362258 No, listen to me, Tommy,<br />you sign them papers,<br />you're like his property.
4362325 4364994 You see, you got no control.<br />You know,<br />this is a dirty business.
4365061 4367497 It's full of these<br />thieves and gangsters,<br />you know,
4367564 4371234 and they promise every good<br />young fighter who comes<br />along...
4371300 4375238 They promise them the world,<br />and then they suck them dry.
4375304 4376806 And they leave them when<br />they ain't worth nothin'.
4376873 4378575 They leave them<br />in the gutter, broke, Tommy!
4378642 4380209 That's the way<br />this business is run.
4380276 4382746 Look, guys like Duke,<br />you know what he is?
4382812 4386583 He's a vampire.<br />He's livin' off<br />your blood, Tommy.
4386650 4389819 You know, the thing<br />I'm trying to do is<br />what Mick done for me.
4389886 4393457 He tried to keep me<br />away from the dirty<br />part of the business,
4393523 4395024 the way I'm trying<br />to do for you.
4395091 4397160 Man, I ain't you!<br />And you ain't Mick!
4397226 4399028 Man, when are you gonna<br />understand that?
4399095 4400530 When are you gonna<br />understand that this<br />is a business?
4400597 4401698 In a business<br />you need...
4401765 4402899 What, brains?
4402966 4404333 You said that, not me.
4404400 4405969 Is that what you're saying?<br />You're saying I got no brains?
4406035 4407471 Look, Rocky, you took me<br />as far as you could.
4407537 4409639 But Duke gave me<br />my title shot, you didn't.
4409706 4412108 And if you wanna keep<br />trainin' me, then do it.<br />But if you don't, don't!
4412175 4413810 But it's my way<br />or it's the highway!
4413877 4415278 (TIRES SCREECHING)

4418181 4419849 <i>(CROWD CHEERING)</i>
4425522 4429759 Rocky, put on your coat.<br />Just put on your coat.
4429826 4432128 Come on.<br />It's not worth it.
4432195 4434931 Adrian, it is worth it.<br />He's just confused.
4434998 4436099 You don't see what's<br />happening under your eyes.
4436165 4437634 Yeah, I do see!<br />What... Yeah, he's...
4437701 4439869 He's twisted around by Duke.<br />I see what's happening.
4439936 4442739 No, come on, it's you,<br />it's not him.<br />You can't live backwards.
4442806 4445809 Come on, you can't<br />turn back the clocks.<br />We live now, we live here.
4445875 4448377 Hey, Adrian, I know where<br />we live. What, do you think<br />I'm stupid?
4448444 4450680 I'm not as dumb<br />as you think I am!
4450747 4453182 (STAMMERING) You don't<br />think I can smell it?
4453249 4454718 I see where we are.
4454784 4456452 Adrian, I don't<br />want this no more.
4456520 4459388 I want something<br />good for the family.<br />I don't want this.
4459455 4461457 I don't want this!
4461525 4464928 I mean, did I come back here<br />and get my brains beat out<br />for these guys to say,
4464994 4466730 "Hey, there goes Balboa"?
4466796 4468832 I'm just another bum<br />in the neighborhood!
4469432 4470634 I didn't want this!
4470700 4473436 No, come on.<br />Nobody says that!
4473503 4475605 I'm sayin' it, Adrian.<br />I'm sayin' this.
4475672 4477607 I'm sayin' this.

4479743 4481978 I was winnin'.<br />When he was winnin',<br />I was winnin'.
4482045 4484113 You were winning?<br />Yeah. It was...

4489318 4491454 I respect you. Yes, I do.<br />It's gone!<br />You can't respect me.
4491521 4493122 I don't respect myself.<br />No, you can't do it!
4493189 4494390 I do!<br />Don't tell me that.
4494457 4496760 All those beatings<br />you took in the ring.
4496826 4498962 I took them with you.
4499028 4500363 I know how you feel.
4500429 4504333 I know when somebody<br />like Tommy comes along,<br />you feel alive.
4504400 4506870 But he's not you.<br />He doesn't have your heart.
4506936 4508538 All those fighters<br />you beat,
4508605 4511374 you beat 'em with heart,<br />not muscle.
4511440 4512742 That's what Mickey knew.

4646609 4649312 and I was talking to you<br />about scams and...
4649378 4652916 I should have listened to you.<br />I was trying to teach you.
4652982 4656786 All right?<br />But you, you were teaching<br />me and I didn't wise up.
4656853 4659022 And I didn't know,<br />and I made mistakes,
4659088 4660690 and I do things,<br />you know.

4995991 4997726 Yeah.
4997793 4999795 Hey, hi, slugger.<br />Good fight, huh?
4999862 5001497 It's okay, dad.
5001564 5003566 You're the real champ<br />around here.<br />I made this for you.
5003632 5004967 Oh, yeah?
5006035 5008571 Beautiful.
5008637 5012541 Rocko, let's put our teeth<br />around a few brews, okay?<br />I could use the company.
5012608 5014009 ADRIAN: Sure.<br />Yeah, good idea.
5015944 5017746 Think I should go out<br />with your uncle Paulie?
5017813 5019115 If I can watch TV.
5019182 5023119 Yeah, hey, okay, listen.<br />Yeah, you can watch TV, okay?
5023186 5025854 But don't stay up too late.<br />You gotta get them bones<br />growin'.
5025921 5027690 All right.<br />Okay.

5032861 5034730 Jeez.
5034797 5037900 I told you you could<br />give him everything but you...<br />You can't give him your heart.
5037966 5040169 Oh, it's okay,<br />Adrian, really.
5040236 5042771 Yeah?<br />Yeah, it's all right.
5044140 5048177 It's... Hey, kid, don't you<br />stay up too late, okay?
5049378 5050713 That was some fight.
5052315 5053882 Are you okay?
5053949 5055184 Oh, sure.
5057186 5058954 I won't be<br />out too late.<br />Okay.
5059988 5061290 See you, champ.
5061357 5064227 Yeah, yeah. Have a good<br />time with Uncle Paulie.
5064293 5065694 Yeah, sure.

5071500 5073869 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />let me present to you<br />the newest,
5073936 5078607 the youngest heavyweight<br />champion of all time,<br />Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!
5078674 5080243 Yeah!
5080309 5081977 Do you think<br />the fight was too easy?
5082044 5083912 He hit me a few good shots.<br />But I was never hurt.
5083979 5086115 I mean, I'm just glad<br />to be the champ. Yeah!
5086182 5088050 Tommy, don't you think<br />that this looked more like
5088117 5091620 a Philadelphia sparring<br />session at times instead<br />of a championship match?
5091687 5092955 It didn't look like<br />you broke a sweat.
5093021 5094423 DUKE: Yeah,<br />you're very observant.
5094490 5096625 Union Cane wasn't<br />feeling that good.
5096692 5101397 But Tommy Gunn would<br />have done the same thing<br />if Union was 100%. Next.
5101464 5104867 100%? He fought like<br />he didn't have a heartbeat.<br />Come on!
5104933 5106869 Everybody knows that Cane<br />is just a paper champion.
5106935 5108337 What do he mean<br />by "paper champion"?
5108404 5110506 It means Cane's title<br />was manufactured.
5110573 5111840 He never won it from Balboa.
5111907 5113976 Gentlemen,<br />give the boy a break.<br />Union Cane is for real.
5114042 5117045 Tommy, you ever think you're<br />gonna get out from underneath<br />Rocky Balboa's shadow?
5117112 5118914 Man, I won the title.<br />What more do I have to do?
5118981 5120483 REPORTER: I'll tell you<br />what you have to do,
5120549 5123018 you've gotta fight some<br />real opponents, right?
5123085 5125053 Balboa fought them all.<br />But I beat<br />the best tonight.
5125120 5126689 The best? The best?<br />This guy's a bum.
5126755 5128591 He doesn't even deserve<br />a shot at the title.
5128657 5131327 Gentlemen, whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />We're getting carried away.
5131394 5134129 Now, Union Cane was<br />the recognized champ.<br />Next question.
5134197 5136799 We know the rating system<br />can be manipulated.
5136865 5139735 The bottom line is<br />Tommy Gunn beat<br />a second-rate fighter
5139802 5142305 with so much glass in his jaw,<br />he ought to be a chandelier.
5142371 5146275 DUKE: Say what you want,<br />but this man will prove<br />to be a great champion.
5146342 5149578 He might win a few fights,<br />but a Rocky Balboa he'll<br />never be.
5149645 5152581 No, no, no.<br />He's no Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's face it.
5152648 5156051 There is only one Balboa.<br />Now, Balboa was a true<br />people's champion.
5156118 5159922 But in time, Tommy Gunn<br />may be able to fill<br />his shoes. Next question.
5159988 5162525 MAN: Not by fighting stiffs<br />like Cane, he won't.
5162591 5164227 Man, I'll fight<br />anybody anywhere!
5164293 5167095 Who? When? When are you<br />gonna fight a real fighter?
5167162 5168797 Gentlemen, gentlemen,<br />gentlemen, come on.
5168864 5171767 We want to thank you<br />for coming tonight,<br />and we'll look forward...
5171834 5174002 Hey, Tommy,<br />I got somethin'<br />for you.
5174069 5176639 For your next fight,<br />why don't you fight the<br />redhead in the front row?
5176705 5178441 I hear she comes real cheap.<br />Huh? What about that?
5178507 5180108 (REPORTERS WHOOPING)
5180175 5183846 DUKE: We look forward<br />to seeing you<br />at Tommy Gunn's next fight.
5183912 5186114 Why the hell did you<br />say Balboa was better, man?
5186181 5187550 Do you believe<br />he's better?<br />Of course not.
5187616 5189285 But we can't<br />talk in here, huh?
5189352 5190786 You the champ.<br />You the champ.
5190853 5192821 MAN: Who are you gonna fight<br />for the next fight, Tommy?
5192888 5194690 Man, what the hell<br />happened in there?
5194757 5197092 I won the damn title,<br />and these people think<br />I'm a bum!
5197159 5199027 Why didn't you take up<br />for me in there?
5199094 5200563 Oh, listen to me,<br />when the press is right,<br />they're right.
5200629 5202365 Right? Man, I'm as good<br />as Balboa ever was.
5202431 5203632 I don't give a damn<br />about what they say.
5203699 5205568 And I'm tired of being<br />called a damn robot, too!
5205634 5208003 Listen to me, Tommy Gunn.<br />You can't fight the press.<br />I can't fight the press.
5208070 5209638 Oh, God!
5209705 5212174 As long as they got<br />Balboa on the brain,<br />he'll always be champ.
5212241 5214042 The man fought<br />wars in the ring.
5214109 5216078 Tommy, face facts.<br />You're in his shadow. I don't<br />know if there's any way out.
5216144 5217179 This is your<br />own man talking!
5217246 5218847 No, no, no!<br />Listen to me.
5218914 5220816 There's a way for you<br />to get the respect<br />you deserve,
5220883 5223586 but what you've got<br />to do is challenge Balboa<br />to fight man-to-man.
5223652 5226389 That's right. Georgie here<br />could set this fight up<br />abroad in a matter of weeks.
5226455 5228090 Oh, yeah, it'd be<br />the greatest fight ever.
5228156 5231427 Teacher against student.<br />Old lion against young lion.
5231494 5233362 And it's the only way<br />you're ever gonna<br />get peace of mind,
5233429 5234763 'cause believe me<br />when I tell you
5234830 5237032 that press is gonna<br />hound you with that<br />man's legend
5237099 5239234 for as long as you dare<br />to wear boxing gloves.
5239302 5241470 You've got to get him<br />into that ring, Tommy Gunn,
5241537 5243205 or you're gonna be<br />hearing questions<br />like you heard tonight
5243272 5245107 for the rest of your life.
5245173 5246975 Then you're gonna<br />start to ask yourself,<br />"Could I really take him?
5247042 5248344 "Am I really good enough?
5248411 5250479 "Do people really think<br />I'm a cheap carbon copy
5250546 5255318 "or a second-rate pretender<br />who only got a shot<br />because of my skin tone?"
5255384 5257720 You've got to challenge<br />that man to fight,<br />Tommy Gunn.
5257786 5260155 And if he refuses,<br />then you gotta insult him!
5260222 5262725 You gotta dog him.<br />You gotta humiliate him.
5262791 5264960 You gotta do whatever<br />you got to do to get<br />him into that ring,
5265027 5266862 but that's what<br />you got to do.
5272335 5275438 ROCKY: Okay, blast off.<br />Rolling silver.
5275504 5278807 And down. Yo, Andy!<br />Andy, flippers ain't flippin'.<br />Yo, Andy.
5278874 5280643 ANDY: Hey, that machine<br />cost me a fortune.
5280709 5283346 Yeah, well, it's costing me<br />a fortune, too, you know?
5283412 5285348 DUKE: Rocky Balboa.
5285414 5287383 What the hell was that?
5287450 5289852 Rocky Balboa,<br />there's a man out here<br />wishing to speak with you.
5289918 5291587 Rocky Balboa!
5293989 5295558 Rocko, you know<br />who that is, huh?
5295624 5296759 MAN: Ain't that the Duke?
5296825 5298193 Yeah, I know<br />who that is.
5300863 5302565 Oh, Rocky,<br />you need some help?
5302631 5305368 No, guys, it ain't<br />no pie-eatin' contest.

5329525 5332361 Now, are you accepting<br />the challenge,<br />or are you yellow?

5409304 5411807 Rocko made you your shot,<br />you know that?<br />He's the real champ.
