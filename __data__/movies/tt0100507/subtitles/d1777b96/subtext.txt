252669 255421 Everybody...<br />Everything's okay.
256840 261761 What's wrong?
261845 267183 Remember when Mick said<br />when he was fighting,
267267 271687 sometimes he'd fight so hard<br />that he was thinking that
272147 277526 he broke something inside,<br />and he was gonna die,
277611 282531 and that's what he said, that's<br />when the angels was pulling on him.
284034 286202 Rocky, you're scaring me.<br />I don't know...
286286 287328 What's wrong?

289706 290873 Can't what?
293543 295586 I can't stop my<br />hands from shaking.
299675 301300 I never felt this thing.
301385 302677 You gotta see a doctor.
302761 304261 No, I...<br />Right away. Yeah!
304388 306430 No, I just wanna go home.<br />No.
306515 307932 No.<br />You can see a doctor.
308016 309308 I'm just tired.
311895 313813 I just wanna go home, Mick.
313897 314939 And I'm just tired.<br />I just...
315023 315982 Okay.

318527 319527 Okay.
321780 322822 Okay.
341758 343342 Adrian, where's the kid?
343427 344927 ADRIAN: I don't know.
345512 349724 I don't see the kid. Where's<br />the kid? Ain't he here?
349975 351767 Dad! Dad!
351852 353352 There he is! There he is!
353437 355896 Hey, slugger, how you doing?

357858 358899 Then I'm forgotten now?
358984 361068 Hi, Uncle Paulie.<br />Dad, how you feeling?
361153 363070 Well, I got a few new dents.<br />How you doing in school?
363155 365114 I made the honor roll.<br />You're beautiful! Home team!
365240 366782 Hi, I'm Sheila Downes,<br />airport security. Hi.
366867 368159 Welcome home.<br />If you'll follow me
368243 369410 there's a press<br />reception inside.
370912 373956 Rocky, how did you feel about<br />the Russian people in general?
374041 376125 You know, it was very<br />good. They was great people.
376209 379045 I mean, I didn't understand what<br />they was speaking all the time,
379129 381255 but I think I understood what<br />they was meaning, you know?
381339 383299 Mrs. Balboa, did you learn any Russian?
383633 384675 Did I learn...
384760 386552 Yeah, yeah,<br />she got fluent in vodka.
386636 387636 Hey, yo, Paulie...
387721 388763 Paulie.
388847 392058 Rocky, there are rumors of physical<br />complications after the fight.
392142 393225 Complications?
393310 395394 No, no,<br />those were rumors.
395479 398439 He's in perfect<br />physical condition.
399733 401192 Rocky. Rocky,<br />a question.
401276 404070 Recently the American Medical<br />Association recommended
404154 405446 that boxing be banned.
405530 406530 Yeah?
406615 407740 REPORTER: Do you agree<br />with the doctors?
407824 409825 Yeah, you know, absolutely.
409910 411827 I think that doctors<br />should never fight. No.
411912 414455 DUKE: That was a beautiful<br />answer, champ. That's right.
414539 416290 Doctors should<br />stay out of the ring.
416374 417750 Doctors should never fight.
417834 419585 They should stay out<br />of the ring forever.
419669 422254 Rocky Balboa,<br />the funniest champion ever.
422339 425424 America's own Rocky Balboa.<br />How are ya? How are ya?
425509 427051 George Washington Duke here,
427135 430763 promoter extraordinaire,<br />welcoming back Rocky Balboa,
430847 433682 champion of all the Americans<br />and all of the Russians.
433767 436560 Now, I would like to digress<br />from the questions a bit
436645 439355 and pose an interesting<br />proposition to the media.
439439 442274 Everyone in this city,<br />certainly in the world of sports,
442359 444235 knows my reputation<br />for promoting
444319 445444 some of<br />the finest extravaganzas...
445529 446612 I... What...
446696 448197 ...in this country.
448281 450616 Well now,<br />with the press present,
450700 452576 I'd like to ask you,<br />Rocky Balboa...
452661 453661 Yeah?
453745 458124 ...to be the flamboyant, rambunctious<br />sportsman we know you can be,
458208 460584 and give this man<br />here, Union Cane,
460669 464296 a chance to challenge you for the<br />heavyweight championship of the world.
464381 467299 Balboa, I want the opportunity<br />to take what you got.
468468 470678 Isn't this bad timing to<br />present a challenger, Duke?
470762 472263 The man just<br />got off the plane.
472347 475599 Timing is the essence of<br />life, gentlemen and ladies.
475684 479186 Now, what I have on this<br />paper is the largest guarantee
479271 482398 ever offered to<br />a champion on this planet!
482566 486318 I'm talking about a fantastic<br />international extravaganza,
486403 490239 to be held in Japan, called<br />"Letting It Go in Tokyo. "
491449 493450 People, ain't it incredible<br />that only in America
493535 495369 could people like us<br />rise from oppression,
495453 499707 rise from poverty, to join hands<br />in this international event?
499791 500875 Only in America!
500959 502042 Excuse me!
503253 506338 Excuse me.<br />My husband is retired.
506423 509008 He has nothing... He has<br />nothing more to prove.
509092 510384 Hey, wait a minute!<br />Wait a minute!
510468 513512 Hey, Rocky, don't you consider<br />this a public responsibility
513597 515890 to respond now<br />rather than later?
516266 517391 Respond to the people.
517475 519602 I mean, isn't this a<br />question of professionalism?
519686 521645 To talk about it now,<br />not later.
521730 523189 Mind if I heal first?
523273 525608 The whipping you got ain't nothing<br />like what I got here for you.
525692 527067 So, what in the hell<br />does this all mean?
527152 530154 No, that isn't enough.<br />We gotta hear about this now.
530238 532114 Gotta think about that.<br />So, anyway,
532199 536744 I wanna tell everybody that<br />the flight over was really nice.
537579 538871 Come on, guys.<br />We need more!
538955 540915 Adrian, you know,<br />if you weren't with me,
540999 542583 I never would<br />have done as good.
542667 544710 You're my Adrian... You're<br />always there, you know?
544794 549256 And my kid, having you is<br />like being born all over again.
549424 552259 Come on, what do you say?<br />Are you gonna retire or not?
552344 555554 Anyway, I'd like... Excuse<br />me. I'd like to go home now.
555639 557014 Are you gonna give us<br />something to write?
557140 559058 Thank you very much. I appreciate<br />it. REPORTER: What do you say?
559476 560559 No.
564105 568067 Don't worry. You'll<br />get him. You'll get him.
588588 590673 I know.<br />Really, it's great.
592175 595135 Yo, look at this place.
596054 598097 I swear, I ain't never<br />leaving this place again,
598181 599181 you know that?
599266 602601 I swear... Hey, would you like to dance?
602686 604603 How about a homecoming<br />dance with your old man?
604688 606105 No, don't be silly.<br />It's cold.
606189 608107 Come on. I'll warm you up, young lady.
608191 610776 Come on, have a dance. Hurry<br />up, the music's almost over.
612988 614071 Do you like the song?
614239 615531 ADRIAN: You should rest.
615615 617157 Yeah, I know.<br />I'm tired. Come on.
617242 618784 Yeah? Well, maybe I'll take you upstairs
618868 620953 and violate you<br />like a parking meter.
621496 622788 It'll cost you<br />a quarter.
622872 624331 Yo, Adrian!
624416 626542 Where'd you learn to<br />talk dirty like that?
629504 633173 Hey, Uncle Paulie, you notice<br />something strange about Dad?
633717 636260 He just took<br />a few hard shots.
636344 639596 I think you tell better<br />jokes than me, Adrian.
642851 645894 Yo, did I hear somebody<br />call for their old man?
645979 647313 Did you do this?
647397 649565 Hey, it's sleep time,<br />kid, okay?
649649 652067 Dad, did you know that your<br />bones grow three times as fast
652152 653277 during the night?
653361 656030 No, I didn't know that, but I<br />heard something like that once.
656114 657197 Is that me?<br />Excellent!
657282 659116 ROCKY JR.: Yeah,<br />that's you.
659200 660451 Now, is that me?<br />Yeah.
660535 662328 When we was fishing, right?<br />Yeah, that's when...
662412 664830 That's beautiful.<br />Look at the tent.
664914 668500 You know, the fish was a<br />lot bigger, if I recall.
668585 671879 Well, actually, that was a lot smaller.
671963 674173 Now, anyway, come on.<br />Hit the bed.
674257 676300 It's time for you to get<br />healthy and everything.
676384 677551 This is great,<br />how you do this.
677635 679470 I don't know where<br />you learned this.
679554 682598 It is something, how this<br />thing comes out of your fingers.
683433 687561 Oh, my God.
690273 691565 Who's this?
693276 696612 That's Madame Dupont,<br />my French teacher.
697030 698280 Really?
701409 703535 Yeah, she looks French, sure.
703620 705954 I wouldn't show this<br />to your mother,
706039 708540 'cause she don't<br />understand French too good.
708625 711710 God. Better cover<br />that one up.
711795 713629 Well, champ,<br />it's bedtime.
714464 716965 Hey, you know what?<br />I know some French talk.
717425 718550 Knock, knock.
718635 719635 Who's there?
719719 720886 Madame.
720970 722054 Madame who?
722138 723889 My damn foot's<br />caught in the door.
723973 725224 That's an old joke.
725308 727935 What do you want from me?<br />I'm trying. You know?
728019 729978 I don't know all the<br />good things, you know?
730063 732523 Hey, what's this?
732607 733690 What?
734567 736318 Look what I<br />found in your ear.
736403 738779 Russian money.<br />Money ears!
739489 742658 All right. Anyway, listen,<br />kid, you gotta get some sleep.
742742 744118 Dad?<br />Yeah?
744494 747371 Today when you said having me<br />was like being born again...
747455 749373 Yeah?<br />What did you mean?
750125 754503 Well, you know, when you come<br />up like I did, and you got like
756005 759633 three square meals of zero<br />a day, you know what I mean?
759717 761927 You got the A side of life<br />and the B side of life.
762011 765764 I'm, like, on the B side, but<br />you, you got all the breaks.
765849 770102 So, when I see you having all<br />these things that I didn't have,
770186 773355 I, like,<br />live through your eyes.
773440 774523 I enjoy it a little bit.
774607 777985 It's like having<br />it all over again.
778069 779361 That's nice.
780613 782739 Hey, look at my face.
782824 784241 Do I look like a raccoon?
785243 786243 A little bit.
786327 788328 Yeah, like Rocky Raccoon?<br />Yeah, a little bit.
788413 790372 No!<br />Yeah, you do a little.
790540 791498 Really?
791583 795502 Hey, if you think I look bad, you<br />ought to see the other guy's knuckles.
797297 800090 Anyway, yo, good night.
800175 801383 Okay, kid?<br />Night.
803678 805053 Dad?<br />Yo.
806598 807890 Glad you're home.
808308 810184 Thanks. I appreciate it.
810852 812519 And we'll play tomorrow,<br />okay?
813271 814938 Maybe you can show me<br />your English teacher.
815023 816315 She's pretty hot, too.
816399 817983 Nah!<br />Yeah.
818067 819485 Good night, kid.
819569 821403 ADRIAN: You deserve the<br />worst for what you did.
822572 824656 Paulie, it wasn't your<br />money. It was Rocky's money.
824741 826492 You gonna be hysterical?<br />You cost us everything.
826576 828494 That's what I need.<br />It was a mistake.
828578 831330 You think I thought this<br />all was gonna happen?
831414 833081 Don't you walk<br />away from me.
833166 835792 You just gave up<br />our life!
836252 838587 And you think it's<br />like some stupid thing?
838671 841340 Paulie! Paulie, do<br />you know what you did?
841424 842883 Do you know the<br />seriousness of what you did?
842967 844009 I understand it!
844093 845427 Do you?<br />Then answer me!
845512 847387 I understand<br />the whole freaking thing!
847472 850849 I understand it! Your<br />accountant's the crook, not me!
850934 852643 I did what I<br />thought was right.
852727 854144 So, now, don't blame me for nothing.
854229 856605 I want to murder the bum<br />worse than anybody.
856689 858690 Hey, Adrian,<br />what's wrong?
858775 860359 Look what you done now.
860443 861527 She's dumping<br />everything on me.
861611 863362 Come on, Paulie. Don't<br />turn this around on me.
863446 864655 Come on, what'd you do, Paulie?
864739 866198 He gave power...
866282 868242 Power of attorney to<br />our accountant. What?
868326 872162 Gave... I just didn't gave<br />anything to nobody, huh?
872247 873330 He sent a letter!
873414 875832 He says we're gonna be in Russia<br />a couple of months. He says,
875917 878377 "And I need Rocky<br />to sign a tax extension!"
878461 882214 Not an extension! That was<br />a power of attorney, Paulie!
882298 884800 He's the thief!<br />I need alcohol.
885552 888303 Rocky, on my eyes, I never<br />stole a freaking dime.
889305 891473 Adrian,<br />what's happening here?
892058 893058 It's gone.
893142 894268 What's gone?
894352 895978 The money.<br />The money.
896062 897938 Everything.<br />It's all gone.
898648 900232 LAWYER: The piece of paper<br />Paulie had you sign
900316 903068 wasn't a request for an<br />extension on your tax returns.
903152 907155 It was a blanket power of attorney<br />in favor of the accountant,
907240 910242 who was involved in some very<br />high-priced commercial real estate.
910326 912411 He thought he could flip<br />it quick, take his profit,
912495 914538 have your money back<br />before you knew it was gone.
914622 917416 And unfortunately for you<br />and everybody in this room,
917500 920252 his deals fell through<br />because the market dried up.
920336 921878 And you lost millions.
921963 923755 So, what are you saying? There<br />ain't nothing I can do about it?
923840 926341 I'm doing plenty. I've filed<br />eight criminal acts against him,
926426 929177 but you've got tremendous debt<br />payment on this property, Rocky.
929262 931430 You didn't pay your tax<br />returns in six years,
931514 933724 and the mortgage on your house<br />hasn't been paid in months.
933808 937269 Wait, we didn't have a mortgage.<br />Our house was fully paid for.
937353 938812 Don't take it from me.<br />Ask him.
938896 942608 Apparently not. There's nearly<br />$400,000 still outstanding.
942692 944484 The only thing you have<br />that's not encumbered
944569 946528 is a gymnasium that was<br />willed to your son
946613 949615 by a Mickey Goldmill<br />in 1982.
949699 952284 You can sell some things.<br />Remember those commercials you did?
952368 954745 You know, Paulie, I ain't<br />no commercial kind of guy.
954829 956663 I'm a fighter.<br />It's what I do for a living.
956748 959249 LAWYER: Nah, it's just as well.<br />We couldn't get any sponsors.
959334 961293 With the investigation<br />of the accountant,
961377 963587 out pops a criminal record<br />of Rocky's for assault
963671 965213 in connection<br />with loan sharking.
965298 967591 But that was a long time<br />ago. He didn't know what...
967675 969176 Why not a couple more fights?
969260 970469 With your<br />popularity right now,
970553 972012 you could be out of<br />this thing in no time.
972096 973138 No, he's retiring.
973222 974640 Rocko, fighting's the ticket.
974724 976642 I said he's retired!
976726 978560 Paulie, we're here<br />because of you!
979187 981438 I'm not taking<br />the heat for all this.
981522 983148 I thought I was<br />doing smart business.
983232 985233 You thought you<br />did smart business?
985318 986276 Hey, you...<br />Me?
986402 988278 What are you talking about me?<br />The accountant was your choice!
988404 989696 My choice? You should<br />have known he was a thief,
989781 990781 but you're never awake
990865 993450 because you live in this fairy-tale<br />world where the air don't move.
993576 995410 Paulie... You're like a<br />season that don't change!
995495 996828 Hey, you don't<br />talk to her like this.
996913 998538 I'm not no tomato<br />can you kick around!
998623 999956 Paulie, no!<br />Yeah!
1000083 1002417 You call Duke. You tell<br />him I'll fight Cane.
1002502 1004169 I don't care,<br />anywhere, anytime.
1004295 1005462 No, Rocky. LAWYER: If<br />that's what you want,
1005546 1006672 I'll get on it right away.
1006756 1007839 No. No.
1007924 1008924 Rocky, Rocky, please.
1009008 1011802 We can't go down like this. A couple<br />of fights, we're out of trouble, Adrian.
1011886 1013011 Yeah, but you said you wouldn't.
1013096 1014221 No, I didn't say anything.
1014305 1015555 Look, did we come<br />this far to lose it?
1015640 1017224 Well, you know, you<br />have to see a doctor.
1017308 1018684 Adrian, I don't need to see no doctor.
1018768 1019810 I need to get<br />a promoter.
1019894 1020977 Hey, you know, you gotta see a doctor.
1021104 1022896 If he says it's all right, I'll<br />support anything you wanna do.
1022980 1024147 I gotta fight, okay?
1024232 1025691 I got problems.<br />I gotta fight.
1026567 1028318 Will you do it for me?
1030613 1032239 All right, for you.
1033199 1036201 DOCTOR: Because of the continuous<br />violent blows to the head,
1036285 1038453 you've developed a condition<br />particular to boxers
1038538 1040872 called cavum<br />septum pellucidum,
1040957 1044376 which is a hole in the membrane<br />separating the ventricles.
1044460 1048255 The brain's surface neurons in this<br />area have also been traumatized.
1048339 1050841 Excuse me, Doctor.<br />Simply stated, Mr. Balboa,
1050925 1054052 it means that you've suffered<br />some damage to the brain.
1054137 1056054 ADRIAN:<br />How long until he recovers?
1056139 1057764 The effects<br />are irreversible.
1059016 1062728 I... Rocky,<br />you have to retire.
1062812 1064146 Adrian,<br />I don't want to retire.
1064230 1065856 You know, this ain't<br />the time to retire.
1065940 1068525 No, not in here,<br />not in no office.
1069152 1072904 I just fought the best fight of<br />my life. I just did that, you know,
1074365 1076908 and all I need<br />is a couple more.
1076993 1079453 No, Rocky, you suffered<br />severe brain trauma.
1079537 1081246 Well, he could be wrong.<br />Anybody could be wrong.
1081330 1082330 I don't think he is.
1082415 1084583 He ain't God. Look, Adrian,<br />only God ain't wrong.
1084667 1086960 Hey, Rocky,<br />this is what's good for you.
1087044 1088754 All I need is<br />a couple easy ones, right?
1088838 1091214 Not with the way it is. You<br />can't get licensed in any state.
1091299 1093675 He can't get<br />licensed anyway, Doctor?
1093760 1094885 That is correct.
1095511 1097971 Rocky,<br />do you love me?
1100183 1102100 Yeah, I love you.<br />Why you ask that?
1102185 1104770 Because if you<br />love somebody,
1104854 1106938 you live with them,<br />you live for them.
1107023 1109065 You don't gamble<br />with a life.
1109150 1112110 Rocky, I don't care<br />about the money. It's you.
1113237 1115030 That's all that matters.
1116657 1120702 Please. We'll be okay. We'll be fine.
1124624 1125874 No one's gotta know...
1127919 1129044 ADRIAN: Uh...
1131297 1133256 No one has to know,<br />doctor, right?
1133341 1135217 It'll be<br />strictly confidential.
1139972 1141306 Thank you.

1206122 1210083 Rocky Balboa's boxing gloves<br />from his first heavyweight fight.
1227727 1229060 Rocky?
1230730 1232105 Hey, it still fits.
1235151 1237652 Why you wearing<br />those clothes?
1237737 1240739 I was just going through some of<br />the stuff up there, and I found 'em,
1240823 1243116 and they feel kind of<br />comfortable, you know?
1243200 1246369 Well, I was looking all<br />over for you downstairs.
1246454 1247412 It's kind of<br />depressing.
1247496 1250206 Yeah, I know<br />what you mean.
1250291 1253418 What's this<br />doing in your ear?
1253502 1254628 What? Oh, God.
1254712 1256212 Remember these?
1256923 1258757 I... Yeah.
1258841 1260592 Go ahead.<br />You...
1260801 1261801 I remember when<br />you took them off.
1261886 1262928 That's right.
1263012 1265847 First time I ever<br />kissed you, remember?
1266140 1267349 Kiss me.
1269185 1272938 Adrian, I want to go out<br />for a little bit, you know?
1273022 1274773 Just take a little walk.
1274857 1276441 I just wanna<br />feel better, but...
1276525 1279402 Hey, could you talk to<br />the kid? 'Cause he's...
1279820 1280820 He's really taking<br />this hard, you know?
1280905 1281988 Sure.
1282114 1283114 Okay?
1283991 1285033 Where you going?
1285117 1286910 I thought I'd go to Andy's.
1331872 1333790 How you doing, Mick?
1404528 1405904 Slip the jab.
1407865 1409324 Slip the jab.<br />Slip the jab.
1409408 1410825 MICKEY: Slip the jab,<br />will ya?
1412411 1413495 Slip the jab!
1416415 1418541 That's right.<br />That's it.
1418626 1420376 Hey, I didn't<br />hear no bell!
1420461 1421669 ROCKY: Okay.
1422505 1423922 MICKEY:<br />All right. That's right.
1424006 1427592 Slip the jab.<br />That's it. Mentalize.
1427676 1429803 See that bum<br />in front of you.
1429887 1433014 You see yourself doing right,<br />and you do right.
1434141 1436101 That's pretty.<br />That's very pretty.
1436769 1438436 Time!
1438521 1441940 Come here, Rock. My God,<br />you're ready, ain't you?
1442024 1443566 And Apollo won't<br />know what hit him.
1443651 1447821 You're gonna roll over him like<br />a bulldozer, an Italian bulldozer.
1448489 1450281 You know, kid,<br />I know how you feel
1450366 1452367 about this fight<br />that's coming up.
1452785 1455120 Because<br />I was young once, too.
1456163 1457622 And I tell you something.
1458916 1464420 Well, if you wasn't here, I<br />probably wouldn't be alive today.
1464964 1467048 The fact that you're here
1467133 1469968 and doing as well<br />as you're doing gives me,
1470052 1473721 what do you call it, a<br />motivization to stay alive?
1474348 1476933 'Cause I think that<br />people die sometimes
1477017 1478560 when they don't<br />wanna live no more.
1479061 1481229 "Nature's smarter<br />than people think. "
1481313 1483648 And nature is smarter<br />than people think.
1483732 1486901 Little by little, we lose our<br />friends, we lose everything.
1486986 1490071 We keep losing and<br />losing till we say,
1491073 1493158 you know, "What the hell<br />am I living around here for?
1493242 1495326 "I got no reason to go on. "
1496745 1501207 But with you, kid, boy,<br />I got a reason to go on,
1502001 1506004 and I'm gonna stay alive, and<br />I will watch you make good.
1506422 1507505 "And I'll never leave you. "
1507590 1508882 And I'll never leave you
1508966 1510425 until that happens.
1510926 1515096 'Cause when I leave you, you'll<br />not only know how to fight,
1515931 1519184 you'll be able to take care of<br />yourself outside the ring, too.
1519268 1520351 Is that okay?
1520436 1521436 ROCKY: It's okay.
1522271 1523980 MICKEY: Okay.
1524064 1525565 Now, I got<br />a little gift for you.
1525649 1527525 Mick, you... Now, wait a<br />minute. Wait a minute now.
1527610 1528568 Wait a minute.
1528652 1529819 Really, I don't<br />need nothing.
1529904 1532447 Look at this. See that?
1532615 1535241 This is the favorite thing<br />that I have on this Earth,
1536535 1539037 and Rocky Marciano<br />give me that.
1539830 1541915 You know what it was?<br />His cufflink.
1543626 1545752 And now I'm<br />giving it to you.
1547004 1549505 And it is gonna be<br />like a...
1550466 1553134 Like an angel on<br />your shoulder, see?
1553928 1558640 If you ever get hurt, and you<br />feel that you're going down,
1559558 1562685 this little angel is<br />gonna whisper in your ear.
1562770 1566606 He's gonna say, "Get<br />up, you son of a bitch,
1568025 1569609 "'cause Mickey loves you. "
1570319 1571402 Okay?
1573072 1574364 Thanks, Mick.<br />All right.
1574448 1576532 I love you, too.
1577451 1578826 Go after 'em, kid.
1579995 1581621 Go after 'em.<br />Thanks.
1586460 1588002 You was the angel.
1589088 1590338 MICKEY: There it is.
1590798 1592257 What happened to<br />his other cufflink?
1592341 1594425 I don't know.<br />He only give me one.
1595344 1597178 He gave it to some bum.
1615698 1619534 Take you back Take<br />you back Take you back
1620452 1622120 Take you back
1622204 1624831 From the streets<br />Cometh a man
1624915 1627041 A fighter<br />Doin' the best that I can
1627167 1629627 To survive Yes, and it's<br />survival of the fittest
1629712 1632255 Strive for what is mine<br />The Lord is my witness
1632339 1634132 Many believe<br />in what they see
1634216 1635174 And I wonder
1635259 1636426 What do they see in me?
1636510 1639012 For a man,<br />he must walk alone
1639096 1640138 To grow
1640222 1641472 And to bring<br />his knowledge home
1641557 1643891 School of hard knocks<br />is my alma mater
1643976 1646269 Lady luck,<br />you know that I got her
1646353 1647770 Fame and fortune<br />never a concern
1647855 1649314 Don't worry about these.
1649398 1651065 All right.<br />Let's go, Paulie.
1652026 1653901 I really can't believe it.<br />This kid's taking this too good.
1654028 1655653 MAN: Need a hand, champ?<br />No, I got it.
1655738 1658281 Hey, Rock. It's good I<br />kept the place, right?
1658365 1659824 How you doing?<br />It saves money.

1661744 1662744 Right?
1663245 1666831 A little aluminum on the<br />front, hey, it's a winner.
1670377 1671461 Thank you.
1673005 1675923 WOMAN: Welcome back, Rocky!<br />We missed ya!
1677468 1679761 It's only... It's only<br />temporary, you know?
1680512 1682055 Come on inside.
1684433 1685433 Thanks.
1693108 1694901 Hello?<br />DUKE: Mrs. Balboa?

1708165 1710249 I mean, what's it gonna take<br />to get you people to realize
1710334 1713711 I'm giving you a chance to<br />pull yourselves together again?
1713796 1716130 Let me handle your husband's<br />career and the money will pour in.
1716215 1718674 You can start living<br />like human beings again.
1719426 1721677 Listen, Mr. Duke, we're<br />living like human beings.
1721762 1723388 You ought to<br />try it sometime.
1724932 1726724 You leave my husband alone.
1730437 1731604 Women.
1738821 1740530 When'd you<br />start that?
1741156 1743533 I don't know. It's like a<br />bad habit that comes back.
1743617 1745034 But, hey, listen.
1745119 1748246 We ain't talking about me,<br />we're talking about you, right?
1748330 1749372 MAN: Hey, Rocky,<br />how you doing, man?
1749456 1750415 Yo. How you doing?

1751917 1753209 Yeah. Thank you.<br />It's great to be back.
1753293 1754877 You know, you're<br />real smart in school,
1754962 1757130 but you gotta be smart<br />on the street, too, see?
1757214 1758423 How do you mean?
1758507 1760216 Well, you gotta know<br />who the players are
1760300 1762135 and, like, who you're<br />talking to around here.
1762219 1764595 Watch out for the scammers.<br />Everybody's gonna try to scam.
1764680 1766597 What's a scam?<br />Ask your father.
1766682 1769142 Well, a scam is<br />like a hustle.
1769643 1770601 PAULIE: He don't get it.
1770686 1772103 ROCKY: Well, you know, like<br />a hustle's related to...
1772187 1773312 WOMAN: Rocky?<br />Yeah?

1776275 1777942 You used to use his<br />head for a punching bag.
1778026 1779026 Yeah, he had<br />a nice head.
1779111 1780278 Welcome back.
1781196 1783823 So, anyway, like a hustle's<br />related to a con, you know?
1783907 1785908 PAULIE: He don't get it.<br />ROCKY JR.: A deception.
1786034 1787034 Excuse me?
1787119 1788202 You're saying<br />beware of deceptions.
1788287 1790329 Yeah, that's good.<br />Absolutely.
1790414 1791747 You're very smart,<br />you know?
1792916 1796502 ROCKY: Hey, ain't this where the<br />Atomic Hoagie shop used to be?
1796587 1798421 I'm new here,<br />Dad.
1798714 1801007 This neighborhood's coming<br />down with tooth decay.
1801091 1802508 It's called<br />urban blight.
1802593 1803634 Yeah?
1804219 1807388 I'll tell you something, this<br />place is blight new, you know?
1807806 1809765 I think a little aluminum<br />siding and some paint,
1809850 1812018 this place could be okay<br />again. What do you think?
1812102 1813978 I don't know. Anyway, we're<br />gonna be late for school. Come on.
1814062 1816981 Hey, Paulie, I wanna talk to<br />the kid private, like, you know,
1817065 1818107 man to smaller man,<br />all right?
1818192 1819400 Right.<br />Like I got no feelings.
1819485 1820485 Come on, Paulie.
1820569 1821694 That's how wars start.
1821778 1823279 Relax, would you?
1823363 1825281 So, anyway, you know, everybody's<br />got an angle, you know?
1825365 1827325 Yo, tough break, Rock.<br />Yeah.
1827409 1829160 Everybody's got<br />a hustle, you know?
1829244 1830369 See, like these kids around here,
1830454 1832038 they got street brains,<br />you see?
1832122 1833164 That's how they live.
1833248 1834707 These kids ain't like...<br />Listen to me.
1834791 1837752 They ain't like no personalities<br />that you growed up with.
1837836 1840463 So you gotta stay very,<br />very sharp around here.
1840547 1842131 I intend to.
1842216 1845760 "Intend. " You know, sometimes<br />you make me feel very stupid.
1846470 1848012 Why?<br />Why?
1848096 1850014 'Cause you're smarter<br />than me, and that's a fact.
1850098 1851682 No, I'm not.<br />Yeah, you are.
1851767 1853851 It's like every day<br />you learn something new,
1853936 1855853 and every day I<br />forget something new,
1855938 1857688 but listen.<br />Listen to me.
1857773 1860399 We're in this thing together,<br />so if you can figure out any way
1860484 1862860 on how to fix things up,<br />don't be afraid to tell me,
1862945 1865905 'cause we gotta stick<br />together, 'cause what are we?
1865989 1867698 What?
1867783 1868950 What are we?
1869701 1870952 Oh, oh...<br />Home team.
1871036 1872787 Home team! You know, you got that right.
1872871 1874539 You know, I used to go to<br />this school when I was a kid.
1874623 1875623 You know. Nice bricks.
1875707 1877708 Used to have good milk<br />at lunch and everything.
1877793 1878876 It was real tough then,
1878961 1881587 but I think you can<br />handle it, don't you think?
1881672 1884757 BOY: No way, you don't even<br />know what you're talking about.
1884841 1886759 If you went here,<br />I can go here.
1887844 1890179 I'm not scared, really.
1890264 1891389 Really?
1892474 1894892 Well, I guess<br />I'm a little scared.
1894977 1896352 But that's normal,<br />don't you think?
1896436 1898563 Yeah. You know,<br />I had 72 fights coming up,
1898647 1900231 and every one of 'em<br />I was scared.
1900315 1903734 So, yeah, you know,<br />that's real, real normal.
1906738 1907738 I'll see ya later.
1907823 1908906 Okay, kid.
1908991 1910408 Here's the front door.
1911910 1913828 Okay. Hey, wait!<br />What's this?
1913912 1914912 What's...
1916164 1917206 Goodness gracious.
1917291 1918749 Where'd this come from?
1918834 1921961 It's a strange place to stash<br />your lunch money, don't you think?
1922045 1924255 It's just a lunch joke, you know?
1924339 1925381 Thanks, Dad.
1925465 1927383 Okay, listen.<br />I'll see you later.
1928176 1930553 Remember, Daddy loves you.<br />You're number one.
1930637 1931762 Home team!
1931847 1934265 Just be nice, right?<br />You'll be okay.
1935267 1937935 And don't mess with<br />nobody's girlfriend.
1938020 1939562 They don't like<br />that around here.
1946486 1948613 ROCKY: You know, Paulie, I'm<br />really worried about the kid.
1948697 1950448 You know, he ain't<br />used to living like this.
1950532 1952283 He don't know<br />the streets or nothing.
1952367 1954952 And that school, I know<br />exactly what's gonna happen.
1955037 1957997 Some wise guy's gonna come<br />up to him 'cause he's my kid.
1958081 1960124 He's just gonna come out<br />and try to bang him out,
1960208 1963127 give him a cheap shot,<br />you know? I mean... Jeez.
1963211 1964295 Mr. Balboa?<br />Yeah?
1964379 1965504 How you doing?<br />My name's Tommy Gunn.
1965589 1966672 Yeah, how<br />you doing?
1966757 1968591 Well, with a name like that,<br />you better be tough.
1968675 1970301 Yeah, very true.<br />It ain't easy.
1970385 1971761 Anyway, I come<br />from Oklahoma.
1971845 1972845 Welcome.
1972929 1974138 I have an amateur's<br />record of 45-to-one.
1974222 1976223 And I turned pro at 18,<br />and I had eight fights.
1976308 1978100 You're a fighter?<br />Yeah, I'm a fighter.
1978185 1981062 And now that I'm 20, I'd just<br />like to show you what I got.
1981188 1982980 Well, I... I mean, I've<br />saved up about 400 bucks.
1983065 1984482 Mr. Rocky Balboa. I could<br />pay you for training.
1984566 1985608 Yeah... What?
1985692 1987401 Excuse me, young man,<br />I have some business here.
1987486 1988653 What, is he lost or what?<br />Thank you.
1988737 1989945 Good to see you again,<br />friend. How you doing?
1990030 1990988 Yeah. How you doing?
1991073 1992657 DUKE: My health is fine.<br />What more could a man ask for?
1992741 1993699 PAULIE: Money and hair.
1993784 1994992 Listen, I gotta<br />go to work now.
1995077 1996160 What? Where? Here? In a sweatbox?
1996244 1997244 Yeah.
1997329 1998454 Can't be good<br />for the image.
1998538 1999955 Urban light.<br />What are you gonna do?
2000040 2001499 Hey, Rocky, Rocky...<br />What'd you say?
2001583 2003584 Urban light. It's<br />"blight. " Urban blight.
2003710 2004835 Rock, George would<br />like you to consider
2004920 2006253 putting on those<br />damn gloves again.
2006338 2008005 It's a hell of<br />a payday.
2008090 2009507 Well, you know,<br />I'm officially expired.
2009591 2010966 No, you do have<br />marquee value.
2011051 2012843 You put butts in the<br />buckets, asses in the seats.
2012928 2014512 A businessman with<br />any sort of brain
2014596 2016847 don't retire when he can<br />still pull in the bread, baby.
2016932 2019058 'Cause only in America do we<br />get these kind of opportunities.
2019142 2021477 Union Cane's going for<br />the title on the 14th.
2021561 2023187 Yeah, here's some<br />tickets. Be our guests.
2023271 2024397 We have a strong<br />feeling about this one.
2024481 2025606 Think he's gonna take it.
2025691 2026857 That's the time<br />to challenge.
2026942 2028984 Because people<br />love comebacks,
2029069 2031362 and there's nothing in the<br />boxing business more commercial
2031446 2032697 than a long-shot comeback
2032781 2035157 of a down-on-his-luck,<br />pure snow-white underdog.
2035242 2036867 Now, like your<br />Mark Twain once said,
2036952 2039412 "Virtue has never been<br />as respectable as money. "
2039496 2040955 Who's Twain?<br />He was a painter.
2041039 2043666 Look, simply put,<br />you're the great white hope.
2043750 2044792 You mean great white dope.<br />No, forget it.
2044876 2045876 No, no,<br />Rock, Rock...
2045961 2047044 I ain't emotionally<br />involved in boxing...
2047129 2048963 Hey, hold it.<br />Hold the bullshit.
2049047 2051048 I know what the problem is.<br />You think I was born yesterday?
2051133 2052425 Merlin, show him<br />the paper.
2052509 2054218 What paper? Now, this<br />is your medical report.
2054302 2056345 It's not so good, but<br />we can work around it.
2056430 2057388 Where'd you get this?
2057472 2058723 It really doesn't matter,<br />does it, Rock?
2058807 2060725 You agree to fight Cane,<br />and George here can guarantee
2060809 2062268 you get licensed in any<br />country around the world.
2062352 2063978 Guaranteed.<br />You can do this?
2064062 2065062 No problem.
2065147 2067022 His comeback's in the bag<br />and worth millions.
2067107 2069483 The time is hot, the<br />deal is hot. Caliente!
2069568 2071360 We could use one more payday. I agree!
2071445 2072695 Adrian, where'd<br />you come from?
2072779 2073946 What do you<br />think you're going?
2074030 2076198 Mrs. Balboa just appeared.<br />This woman is magic.
2076283 2077742 Look, I don't think<br />you're very funny.
2077826 2079702 Are you trying to talk my<br />husband into fighting again?
2079786 2081328 We're talking business,<br />now, darling.
2081413 2083330 Do you like feeling hard up?
2083415 2086041 Do you like reaching in your<br />pocket and only feeling your leg?
2086126 2088085 Well, do you?<br />I didn't think so.
2088170 2090296 I'm offering you your<br />last golden opportunity
2090380 2091672 to dump this loser image.
2091757 2092965 Who you talking to?
2093049 2094341 Hey, Adrian, you<br />weren't working across...
2094426 2097553 Hey, what the hell are you<br />two people talking about?
2097637 2099138 This is<br />a tremendous opportunity.
2099222 2100681 Opportunity for who?
2100766 2103309 For you to make money?<br />For him to be disabled?
2103393 2105811 What would you do if the<br />choices were reversed?
2106229 2108022 You have to<br />think about that.
2108690 2111025 Rocky, they don't<br />care about you.
2111943 2114111 You want to get serious?<br />Let's get serious.
2114196 2116781 You represent the dreams of the<br />long shots, the little people.
2116865 2118407 The never-wills<br />identify with you,
2118492 2120451 and identification is<br />the key to public success.
2120535 2123454 You're a true champion, a true<br />product of the people. Now sell it.
2123538 2125331 Sell it while<br />there are still buyers.
2125415 2126415 They ain't<br />gonna last forever.
2126500 2127583 You say you're a fighter?<br />Then fight!
2127667 2129585 You say you want a<br />champion's do, then do it
2129669 2132296 and I'll make you so much<br />money you could swim in it!
2132380 2134006 You can swim,<br />can't you, darling?
2134090 2135674 What do you say?<br />Come on. Put it there.
2135759 2137468 It's time to put some hustle<br />behind this muscle.
2137552 2140471 He's done!<br />He's done fighting!
2147646 2149897 You're a damn fool.
2151358 2154318 Maybe we ought to sign Mrs.<br />Balboa to fight Cane, huh?
2154402 2157446 Looks like she's the one with<br />the cojones in the family.
2160075 2163202 Yo, you don't talk like that<br />in front of my wife, you know?
2163286 2165204 That ain't no<br />park bench, boy.
2169292 2170626 I'll get him.
2170710 2173087 Rocky, I'm really sorry.<br />I didn't wanna...
2173171 2175089 Hey, you guys<br />want privacy now?
2175173 2176298 I'll be upstairs.
2180303 2181387 Rocky...
2182764 2184932 Rocky, I'm sorry.<br />I... I...
2185016 2188477 But, you know, it just takes one<br />bad hit, and you could be an invalid.
2188562 2190437 Well, I feel like<br />an invalid already, Adrian.
2190522 2191689 Why'd you gotta<br />come back here?
2191773 2193482 You're too smart<br />for this place here.
2193567 2195192 I got nothing to do.
2195277 2197027 Gloria. I called Gloria.
2197112 2199697 She said, you know, she<br />could use some part-time help.
2199781 2201282 Yeah, but why do you<br />wanna do this, Adrian?
2201366 2203492 Why do you wanna go back to<br />the same place you started from?
2203577 2205578 I gotta do it,<br />but you don't gotta do it!
2205662 2209123 I wanted to be there so<br />I could be close to you.
2218508 2220050 All right. Yeah.
2220135 2222303 You know, it's getting a<br />little cold out here. Maybe...
2222387 2224096 Okay. Maybe you<br />better get inside, okay?
2224180 2225222 I understand.
2225307 2227099 Are you all right?<br />What?
2227183 2228183 Are you all right?
2228268 2229894 Yeah, I'm all right.<br />I'm fine.
2229978 2231729 Hey, it's getting cold, okay?
2237986 2241780 Yo, Adrian!<br />Did we ever leave this place?
2244576 2246327 I don't know!
2251833 2253626 Hey, mind if I<br />talk to you now?
2254794 2257087 My head's<br />a little busy right now.
2269059 2270267 George, I don't know<br />if you're gonna get him.
2270352 2272061 This guy, Balboa, he don't<br />think straight anymore.
2272145 2274063 None of these bums think straight,<br />but all I need is an angle.
2274189 2275940 I'll fight Balboa right now. Hey...
2276024 2277441 I'm better than<br />Balboa ever was.
2277525 2278859 Hey, hey!
2280362 2283322 I own the paper on you, boy.<br />You will fight who I tell you,
2283406 2286367 where I tell you, and how<br />I tell you, you got that?
2287827 2290371 Don't aggravate the<br />hand that feeds you, huh?
2290538 2291538 All right?
2294167 2296210 None of these bums<br />think straight.
2300882 2302383 All I need is a hook.
2314229 2316355 Hey, ain't you Rocky's kid?
2317065 2318107 Yeah, you're<br />Rocky's kid.
2318191 2319358 You're Rocky's<br />kid, right?

2343717 2345426 BOY: Don't get sick now!
2346052 2348429 Hope you don't<br />catch cold, rich boy!
2351850 2353350 Keep it high.<br />Slipping and sliding.

2355437 2356603 That don't interest you?<br />This cup?
2356688 2358939 Rocky drinks out of it<br />around the house. Ten bucks.
2359024 2360816 Well, hey, man. How I<br />know it's the real thing?
2360900 2362526 Look at the<br />lip marks, huh?

2415163 2417956 Hey kid,<br />you got the headgear?
2418041 2420084 Nah, I don't<br />need one. Nah.
2421628 2423921 He's gonna get his<br />cojones knocked out.
2424464 2426256 Okay. Ready, guy?
2426341 2428634 Benson, go easy, all right?
2428718 2430636 BENSON: Sure. Okay, Rock.<br />Time.
2431554 2434014 All right.<br />Just go easy now.
2434099 2435766 Slip the jab now.
2437602 2438602 TRAINER: Go easy.
2438686 2439770 Hey, kid.<br />What's his name again?
2439854 2441438 Tommy Gunn.<br />Tommy Gunn.
2441523 2444566 Tommy. Whoa!<br />It ain't no law to duck.
2444651 2445651 TRAINER: That's it.
2445735 2447152 Go side to side.<br />That's it.
2447403 2450447 Whoa! All right,<br />that's enough.
2450532 2452282 Hey, man!<br />Take it easy, man!
2452367 2453909 Hey, come on,<br />you guys, lighten up.
2453993 2455953 It's called sparring.<br />Now, go on easy.
2456037 2457496 Whoa! Hey, hey!
2457580 2459123 Okay, okay.
2459207 2461291 Hey, lighten up!<br />That's it. Tie him up.
2461376 2462668 That's it.<br />You smell that, Rocko?
2462710 2464586 What's that? That's<br />the odor of opportunity.
2464671 2466088 TRAINER: Hey, that's it.
2466172 2467965 What'd I tell you?<br />Hey, hey! Time!
2468049 2469883 Hey, that's it! Time!
2469968 2471385 TRAINER: Chill out, man!<br />PAULIE: Call time!
2471469 2473428 Time!<br />Hey! Hey, back off!
2473513 2475973 Hey, that's enough!<br />What's the matter with you?
2476057 2477558 Tommy, are you crazy<br />or something?
2477642 2479059 Hey, what's<br />the matter with you, man?
2479144 2480561 TRAINER: Get out of the ring.<br />I'm sorry.
2480645 2481645 Get out of the ring.<br />Cool off, kid.
2481729 2483021 All right.<br />I'm sorry about this.
2483106 2485065 He stinks of opportunity,<br />Rocko.
2485400 2486650 Hey, look.
2486734 2488986 Going easy don't mean<br />breaking bones, kid.
2489070 2490654 Man, I'm sorry.<br />But what do you think?
2490738 2493323 What do I think? I don't<br />think you listen too good.
2493408 2496160 But you, you fight, you brawl<br />like you was a street fighter,
2496244 2497452 and I know<br />something about that.
2497537 2500414 But this is called boxing.<br />This ain't no mugging, you know?
2500498 2502166 I'm sorry. But I know I can do it all.
2502250 2504418 Yeah? Well, not<br />on this date, okay?
2505461 2506545 That's it?
2506629 2508547 Hey, yo, I gotta work<br />with these kids here.
2508631 2510007 You guys get ready.<br />Come on, one more.
2510091 2511466 How about you<br />try to manage me?
2511551 2512551 Manage?
2512635 2516263 Yeah, unless you think<br />I ain't got nothing going.
2516347 2517973 Man, got nothing going?
2518057 2520642 Yeah, all right, you got a lot<br />going. You got a lot of tools.
2520727 2523353 But I ain't no manager.<br />I ain't never been...
2523438 2525355 You know, the gentleman<br />that owned this place,
2525440 2526523 that was a manager.
2526608 2530611 But, me,<br />I was always the managed guy.
2531279 2533614 Hey, look.<br />Good luck, all right?
2536367 2537826 All right, guys.<br />Let's go.
2538870 2540078 Come on,<br />move around.
2542123 2543874 That's it. Nice.
2556846 2558305 All right, you guys, come on.
2558389 2560140 No cheap shots.<br />Move it around.
2567732 2569233 How you doing?
2570109 2572653 Cold? You look cold.
2573655 2576240 I guess it has something<br />to do with the weather.
2577992 2579701 Here, take my coat.
2580370 2583789 No, thanks.<br />Where's your boyfriend?
2584332 2587334 Him. Forget it. He ain't got no manners.
2589087 2591421 I'm Jewel,<br />if you wanna know.
2593174 2595259 I'm Robert.
2595343 2596593 Hi.
2597887 2600514 Well, I been living here<br />about six years now.
2601516 2603725 It ain't Disneyland.
2603810 2605352 You been to Disneyland?
2605436 2606561 Sure.
2606688 2609231 You make it sound<br />like everybody has.
2609607 2611441 I know you can't tell<br />by the way I look,
2611526 2614069 but I ain't like the<br />other kids around here.
2615071 2617864 Why? I mean, what<br />makes you so different?
2617949 2618991 I don't know.
2619075 2620117 I guess it's<br />'cause I wanna get out.
2620201 2621994 You know how it is.
2623788 2628583 You know, for an Italian kid,<br />you ain't got a bad butt.
2630169 2631712 BOY: Shut up, man.<br />Let's go. Come on.
2637635 2639970 PAULIE: First money I get,<br />I'm going to Miami.
2640054 2641305 Why Miami?
2641389 2643223 Miami needs<br />new gigolos.
2643308 2645475 Yeah, I read<br />something like that.
2645935 2647102 Ow.
2648730 2650230 My back is getting bad.
2650315 2652274 How come you<br />don't have arthritis?
2652358 2653483 Yo, ain't I got enough?
2653568 2655235 MAN 1: Hey,<br />watch where you're going.
2655320 2657112 Adrian's too good for this.
2658364 2660657 This place is really depressing,<br />Paulie, you know? It's...
2660742 2661742 MAN 2: Yo, Rock,<br />come inside.
2661826 2663869 Everybody's been asking<br />for you. You too, Paulie.
2663953 2665620 ROCKY: Hey, no, thanks.<br />I'm a little beat.
2665705 2667247 I'm a little thirsty.
2667332 2668498 Hey, you go if you want to, Paulie.
2668583 2669541 Mr. Balboa?
2669625 2671293 Look at this.<br />Tommy Gunn.
2671377 2672961 Yo, why you still<br />hanging around, kid?
2673046 2675005 Is there something<br />I can do for you?
2675089 2677424 Yeah. I'd like<br />to try again.
2678051 2679926 Hey, kid, you know,<br />I'd like to help you out,
2680011 2682095 but I really don't know<br />nothing about no managing.
2682180 2683680 All I'm asking<br />for is a chance.
2683765 2685349 Man, if I screw up or do<br />something you don't like,
2685433 2687142 man, you don't have to throw<br />me out. Hell, I'll leave.
2687226 2688352 What have you<br />got to lose?
2688436 2690228 Me? Nothing. I ain't<br />got nothing to lose.
2690313 2691355 It's what you got to lose.
2691439 2692814 And I got nothing to lose.
2692899 2694024 Maybe you do. Like, look,
2694108 2695484 what if I don't<br />do good, right?
2695568 2697402 You know,<br />and you don't make it?
2697487 2700655 I don't want you blaming me<br />for this, kid, you know?
2700740 2702366 You know, here's what<br />I would do if I was you.
2702450 2703450 No, listen to me.
2703534 2705535 If I was you,<br />here's what I would do.
2705620 2708288 I would go home, and I'd<br />talk to your family people.
2708373 2710207 Maybe you could come up with<br />something better, you know?
2710291 2711708 I got no family people.
2711793 2713668 Man, all I got is<br />what you see here.
2713753 2714920 Man, I know everything about you
2715004 2717130 from back when you had your<br />first fight with Apollo Creed.
2717256 2718882 Yeah. I read how nobody cared about you,
2718966 2720509 how no one ever<br />gave you a chance.
2720593 2722552 And I realize I don't come<br />from the same streets as you do,
2722637 2724513 but I'm hungry<br />like you were.
2724597 2725847 And ever since<br />I put on gloves,
2725932 2727140 I've been<br />waiting to meet you,
2727225 2730310 'cause I knew that if anybody<br />could make me a winner, it was you.
2731229 2734564 Winner. Hey, Paulie, you<br />see a winner standing here?
2734649 2736525 Yes! Man,<br />you beat the best!
2736609 2738276 Nobody could ever<br />say any different.
2738361 2740278 Look, Rock,<br />you don't know me,
2740363 2742531 but anything you want me to do, I'll do.
2742615 2745158 And if I can't,<br />I'll bust my butt trying.
2745243 2746618 Man, I'm not<br />hustling you, man.
2746702 2748703 All I'm asking<br />for is a chance.
2748788 2750247 Man, just one shot.
2761092 2762676 Are you hungry?
2764846 2766221 Yeah.
2766305 2767431 Yeah?
2768182 2769391 Come on.
2769851 2772394 You're really gonna like the<br />way Adrian cooks, you know.
2772478 2775188 She does, like, amazing<br />things with macaroni,
2775273 2776314 especially tomatoes.
2776399 2777899 But I gotta warn you.
2777984 2780026 She can be a little<br />vicious with the garlic.
2782697 2785198 So, why'd this kid<br />smack your face for?
2785283 2786741 It really doesn't matter, Dad. Sorry.
2786826 2787826 Hell, sure, it matters.
2787910 2789494 It does matter.<br />They took his coat.
2789579 2791037 No. They... Look, I don't want the coat.
2791122 2792414 They took the one<br />with the collar?
2792498 2794124 ADRIAN: I'm gonna go to your<br />school tomorrow and just...
2794208 2795917 Yeah, you should. You'll only<br />make things worse if you go.
2796002 2797085 Can't I do what<br />I think is right?
2797170 2798795 Well, you know, what<br />do you think is right?
2798880 2800672 A baseball bat across<br />the face would be nice.
2800756 2802132 Paulie, what are<br />you telling this kid?
2802216 2803341 Adrian, can I have<br />the plate?
2803426 2804634 I'm sorry, yes, Rocky.
2804719 2806970 You know, I had trouble one<br />time when I was in school.
2807054 2809264 It seemed like every day<br />I got chased by this one kid,
2809348 2811391 till one day my mother<br />said to me, she said,
2811476 2813226 "Just pretend<br />the guy's like a balloon. "
2813311 2814519 Balloon?
2814604 2817481 She said if you pop him hard,<br />these guys just go away.
2820234 2822652 Tommy, we're trying to raise our son
2822737 2825197 so he can handle<br />his problems with his mind,
2825281 2826573 not his muscles.
2827241 2828241 Sorry.
2828326 2829326 That's why I'm<br />gonna get mangled.
2829410 2831328 No, you ain't gonna<br />get mangled.
2831412 2833163 Dad, will you<br />teach me how to fight?
2833247 2834915 PAULIE: A baseball bat<br />would be nice.
2834999 2837918 Come on. Do you want to grow<br />up and just use your fists?
2838002 2840378 You know, Adrian, I don't<br />think it would be so bad
2840463 2844841 if I taught him how to throw<br />a few deadly punches, you know.
2844926 2846843 Tommy, did your Dad<br />teach you how to fight?
2847220 2848512 No. Not exactly.<br />I had to...
2848596 2849638 What?
2849722 2850805 Come on, sweetheart,<br />don't get personal.
2850890 2851890 No, it's okay.
2851974 2855143 See, my old man, he used<br />to drink a lot, seriously.
2855228 2857521 He'd go out with his<br />friends and tie one on,
2857605 2859189 then he'd come home<br />and look to punch on me.
2859273 2861525 You know, he'd punch on my mother, too.
2861609 2863276 He did that<br />a lot of times.
2863361 2865695 You know, so, growing up, I never<br />really thought about fighting anybody
2865780 2866988 but my father.
2867073 2870116 You know, when I was 13,<br />I got in trouble at school.
2870201 2872369 He tied me down<br />and he whipped me so bad
2872453 2873745 I couldn't walk for a week.
2873829 2875288 Just couldn't do anything.
2876499 2879417 But, I tell you, the first guy<br />I ever knocked out was my father.
2879502 2883046 And now when I get in the ring,<br />it's like all I see is him.
2883130 2885257 That's kind of sick, huh?
2886092 2887759 Hey, yo, Tommy.<br />At least you had
2887843 2889636 an old man to<br />knock out, you know.
2892098 2893265 Yeah.
2894600 2896601 Some of us didn't even<br />have that, you know?
2896686 2898436 Yeah, someday you could<br />punch out your pop.
2898521 2901189 Hey, yo, Paulie, what are you<br />telling the kid things like this?
2901274 2903149 Hey, it's fittest<br />of the survival.
2904569 2905860 Hey, Tommy,
2905945 2907696 where you staying tonight?<br />You got a place?
2907780 2910323 I'll find someplace to stay.<br />I mean...
2910408 2912701 No, I tell you, we got<br />room down in the basement.
2912785 2913785 It's not...<br />It's nice, I don't know.
2913869 2914869 What about me?
2914954 2917163 Wait, now, sweetheart. Your<br />son is sleeping down there.
2917248 2919958 No, well, he can stay<br />with his uncle, right?
2920042 2921209 What the hell am I?<br />A pit stop?
2921335 2923336 ROCKY: No... Hey, I don't<br />want to cause any problems.
2923421 2924671 I mean, I can find someplace to stay.
2924755 2926298 No, it's okay.<br />You know, it's just
2926382 2929551 for a little while,<br />you know, right?
2929635 2931261 No problem at all. You<br />know, it'll be all right.
2931345 2933805 Hey, kid, I appreciate it. Is<br />that all right? It's cold outside.
2933889 2935432 Hey, I'm not<br />changing no sheets.
2935516 2937767 Hey, since when<br />have you ever?
2938769 2940228 Hey, Tommy, why don't<br />you come on down
2940313 2942731 and we'll show<br />you the whole place?
2942815 2944024 Sweetheart, why don't you go downstairs,
2944108 2945108 show your Father<br />what you did today?
2945192 2947027 Come on. Come on.
2951657 2954159 Hey, junior, your plumbing<br />don't leak, do it?
2961792 2962834 You know this guy?
2962918 2964502 Yeah. He hits hard.
2967381 2968965 TOMMY: You know, Adrian,<br />man, she can really cook.
2969050 2970133 ROCKY: Yeah,<br />she's okay.
2970217 2971760 Listen, Tommy,<br />we ain't had a chance
2971844 2974638 to get this place<br />too nice, so...
2974722 2977098 I'll get it together in<br />a little while, you know.
2978142 2980602 Wow, man! This is what it's all about!
2980686 2981936 Holy mackerel...<br />Well, I...
2982021 2984230 Why do you keep<br />this stuff down here?
2984315 2985649 When did you get<br />a chance to do this?
2985733 2986900 He took<br />everything out of a box
2986984 2988485 and fixed this up like this.<br />It's beautiful!
2988569 2992197 And you painted! When'd you<br />get a chance to do this, kid?
2992281 2994157 After school.<br />It's no big deal.
2994241 2996159 If you don't mind me asking,<br />where'd you get the glove?
2996243 2997243 This?<br />Yeah.
2997328 2999287 Thanks. This is one<br />of my favorite objects.
2999372 3002207 You know, like, Mickey give<br />me this before he departed.
3002291 3004793 It was Rocky Marciano's<br />cufflink that we had fixed.
3004877 3006961 Really? The real Rocky Marciano? Yeah.
3007046 3008797 Yeah. You know, you got me<br />thinking about Mick.
3008881 3010382 I wanna show you something.<br />Come on.
3010466 3014094 He told me a long time ago.<br />He says that,
3015221 3017889 fightin' is like,<br />90% in the skull
3017973 3019265 and 10% in the body.
3019350 3020558 This is what<br />he says to me.
3020643 3023561 Hey, Dad, I met this really<br />nice girl today. She's great.
3023646 3024729 Yeah? Really?<br />That's wonderful.
3024814 3027065 Yeah, she's a lot<br />better than Sarah.
3027149 3028608 Hey,<br />don't change the station.
3028693 3030068 I'll be right back with you.
3030152 3032946 I just wanna tell Tommy<br />a few things, you know? Hey.
3033030 3035949 Who was your best<br />friend back in Orlando?
3036033 3038243 That's...<br />That's Oklahoma.
3038327 3040286 Right, well, yeah.<br />Eric Elder.
3040371 3044499 No, no, no. No, your best friend<br />is a guy named Frankie Fear.
3044583 3047252 You see, fear is<br />a fighter's best friend.
3047336 3049295 You know, but it ain't<br />nothing to be ashamed of.
3049380 3052298 See, fear keeps you sharp,<br />it keeps you awake,
3052383 3054426 you know, it makes you want to<br />survive. You know what I mean?
3054510 3057887 But the thing is, you gotta learn<br />how to control it. All right?
3057972 3059889 'Cause fear is like<br />this fire, all right?
3059974 3061766 And it's burning deep inside.
3061851 3065186 Now, if you control it,<br />Tommy, it's gonna make you hot.
3065271 3067772 But, you see, if this<br />thing here, it controls you,
3067857 3070734 it's gonna burn you and<br />everything else around you up.
3070818 3072110 That's right, you know?
3072194 3075697 Anyway, these are the<br />things that was taught to me,
3075781 3078658 and if you want,<br />I'd like to teach to you.
3079201 3081953 So, this... This mean<br />you're gonna manage me?
3082037 3084038 Absolutely.<br />Hey, home team! Okay!
3084123 3085373 All right! Yeah!
3085458 3086750 Let's go for it.<br />TOMMY: Hey, Rock,
3086834 3088918 as long as we're down here, do<br />you mind showing me a few things?
3089003 3091337 Sure, Tommy. I'm gonna<br />show you a lot of things.
3096594 3099637 Hey, rich boy, how much you<br />got in your pocket today?
3099722 3101473 Nothing.<br />Come on, let's have it.

3123871 3125246 Rocky!
3125331 3126456 Yo!
3128667 3131461 Well, I didn't want to<br />disturb you that much, Father.

3135174 3137091 Everything is perfect.<br />You know...
3137176 3139469 Father, this is my<br />new friend, Tommy Gunn.
3144475 3146851 Well, I was wondering... You<br />know, Tommy here is a fighter,
3146936 3148686 and I'm supposed to be<br />his manager, you know?
3148771 3150522 So I was wondering if<br />you could do me a favor,
3150606 3151815 you know,<br />if you ain't that busy.
3151899 3154234 If you could throw us down<br />a couple blessings, you know?
3154318 3156861 One, that I don't<br />mess up being a manager,
3156946 3159656 and B, that Tommy does as<br />good as I think he can do.
3159740 3162992 You know, great, and don't get<br />hurt none. Could you do that?
3171252 3172418 I love when he does that.
3172503 3175004 Hey, thanks, Father.<br />I really appreciate this.
3176215 3177215 Anytime.
3177299 3179092 Okay. Hey, I'll see you<br />in church!
3181679 3182679 Okay.
3182763 3183930 Hey, man, what'd you do this for?
3184014 3186474 Hey, it don't hurt having an<br />angel in your corner, you know?
3186642 3187684 Come on!
3191814 3193523 Hey, Rock,<br />how's it going?
3193607 3194732 ROCKY: Doing great, guys!

3198612 3199779 How you doing, Tom?
3210291 3213084 Break it up. Break! Break! Break it!
3225431 3226598 Get off the ropes.
3234607 3235648 Just go easy, all right?
3235733 3236733 Man, I need more work.
3236817 3238401 No, no, no, you're ready.<br />No, I need more work.
3238485 3239611 This guy's killing me.

3244825 3245867 Shut up! Listen to me.
3245951 3247785 Mick used to say<br />the only difference
3247870 3250914 between a hero and a coward is<br />the hero's willing to go for it.
3250998 3252582 All right? He's willing<br />to take the shot, okay?
3252666 3254042 Now, this guy over<br />here is scared, too.
3254126 3255835 You're scared. He's<br />scared. You're both scared.
3255920 3258087 Remember, in the basement,<br />when we was talking about fear
3258172 3259797 and how it's<br />like this fire, huh?
3259882 3262383 And you gotta control it 'cause<br />it's like, it'll, like, burn you up
3262468 3263760 or it's gonna burn him up.<br />All right?
3263844 3265845 Now, you gotta make it<br />work for you, Tommy, okay?
3265930 3267722 I would never do nothing<br />that would hurt you.
3267806 3269015 You gotta understand<br />what I'm saying.
3269099 3270558 Now, fear is like<br />this fire, okay?
3270643 3273686 Now, let it burn and burn until<br />it becomes like this volcano,
3273771 3275772 and when the time is right,<br />and you see the opening,
3275856 3277440 explode all over<br />this guy, okay?
3277524 3278858 Now, you can take him, okay?
3278901 3280360 It's all heart, you<br />understand? Okay. Got it.
3280444 3282612 It ain't all muscle, it's<br />all heart. Heart and fire.
3282696 3283947 Heart and fire! Okay.
3284031 3284989 Now you do it.
3287701 3290370 Remember, I'm like this angel<br />sitting on your shoulder, okay?

3845759 3847801 Why? Why? It's Christmas time.

3864694 3866695 He's given us some<br />things too, you know?
3866780 3868864 He's given us, like,<br />a second shot, right?
3868949 3870157 Come on, it's Christmas.
3873161 3875287 DUKE: That's right.<br />Only in America.
3875372 3877623 Having the best,<br />wearing the best.
3877791 3879667 But to keep it up,<br />you gotta stay on top.
3879751 3881210 Nobody remembers<br />number two, kiddo.
3881294 3882378 I sure don't.
3882462 3885339 Now, Tommy, I've checked<br />with the boxing commission.
3885423 3888676 It seems there's no formal<br />contract between you and Balboa.
3889844 3891929 No, nothing. Just a... Just a handshake.
3892013 3895724 Tommy, this is a complex business<br />and you got to stay sharp.
3895809 3897560 But I don't have to<br />tell you that, do I?
3897644 3900312 'Cause it gotta be damn difficult,<br />you living in Rocky's shadow,
3900397 3901689 people calling<br />you his puppet.
3901773 3903774 I don't know anybody who could<br />have done it as long as you have.
3903858 3905484 Tommy, I'm afraid.
3905569 3908237 I'm afraid that if you keep<br />going the way you're going,
3908321 3910489 you're gonna be watching<br />the parade go by.
3911366 3912366 Exactly.
3913118 3915244 Tommy, you haven't had<br />the big payday yet,
3915328 3917746 and you won't until you<br />fight those top contenders.
3917831 3921083 And those top contenders,<br />Tommy boy, I do surely own.
3921167 3923586 I got the contracts.
3923670 3925129 It's a complex business.
3926047 3928882 But if you want the best,<br />then go with the best.
3928967 3930551 Man, what about Rocky?<br />I mean...
3930635 3931760 Rocky can still train you.
3931845 3933721 My God,<br />he's done a wonderful job.
3933805 3936599 Now look here,<br />here's $20,000.
3936683 3937975 Take it as an advance.
3940186 3942354 Time to put some hustle<br />behind this muscle.
3942439 3946442 Merry Christmas.
3947902 3949445 ROCKY: Whoa,<br />stop the presses!
3949529 3952114 Yo, Adrian, I can't believe<br />who just come up on the roof.
3952198 3955242 You know, hey, you know, he<br />just landed there and crashed.
3955327 3956452 And who do you<br />think it is?
3956536 3958495 Do I hear<br />reindeer on my roof?
3959456 3961123 You know...
3961207 3962207 Rantlers.
3962292 3964710 Unbelievable.<br />It's like a billion...
3964794 3966295 Whoa! Come on.
3966379 3968464 Look who's here!<br />You know this guy.
3968548 3970132 You got a weird family.
3970216 3971258 Don't I know.
3971343 3973302 It's gonna be next Christmas<br />before he gets down.
3973386 3976680 Hey, let's put it<br />together for Santa! Hey!
3976765 3978432 Merry X-mas. Yo, yo, yo.
3978516 3980601 Hey, I don't think<br />you got it right, Santa.
3980685 3983729 No, no, no.<br />It's, "Ho, ho, ho. "
3983813 3984855 What's<br />the freaking difference?
3984939 3986690 Where I come from,<br />it's, "Yo, yo, yo. "
3986775 3989151 Looks like we got<br />a 90-proof Santa.
3989235 3991028 Hey, Santa,
3991112 3993822 tell all the kids what<br />you got in the bag for them
3993907 3995324 that you brought<br />from the North.
3995408 3997159 Yeah, I got my laundry.
3997243 3998827 No, you got the wrong bag.
3998912 4000913 Come on, chubby, get out<br />of the way. Yo, watch it.
4000997 4002164 Let Santa take a seat.
4002582 4004041 Come here, little boy.<br />You been nice?
4004167 4006168 Uncle Paulie! Come over<br />here. Sit down here.
4006252 4008754 Hey, kid, why don't you tell<br />Santa what you need? What you...
4008838 4010172 He's stretching<br />the clothes, man.
4010256 4011507 I don't need nothing.
4011591 4014468 Hey, kid, tell Santa what<br />you really want. Come on.
4014552 4017846 That ain't Santa. It's<br />Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.
4017931 4019014 ROCKY: What do you mean,<br />"Get real"?
4019099 4020724 You know,<br />why you talking like that?
4020809 4022726 We're just trying<br />to have a good time,
4022811 4025062 and Santa's here<br />and everything and...
4025146 4026397 It's stupid!
4027440 4029983 Yo, you know, come on. It ain't stupid.
4030068 4031985 We're just trying<br />to pretend here.
4032070 4034446 But you see, you're<br />supposed to be pretending.
4034531 4036990 It's like this game,<br />right? You know?
4037075 4039576 I don't like pretending. Why<br />don't you guys talk to Santa?
4039661 4041954 Hey, yo, kid, you know,<br />I ain't talking to them.
4042038 4043872 I'm talking with you,<br />here, you know.
4043957 4047376 See, it's very important that<br />you spend time with the family,
4047460 4049044 you know,<br />and have a good time and
4049129 4051130 just getting the spirit<br />going, you know...
4051214 4052214 It's good, right?
4052298 4053966 Good for what?<br />Come on, let's go.
4055802 4058554 Look, his friends are here.<br />Maybe he doesn't want to.
4058638 4060889 Adrian, I know<br />what he wants.
4060974 4062558 How do you know<br />what I want?
4062642 4063726 'Cause I know you.
4063810 4066603 You know me?<br />He thinks he knows me.
4068898 4070524 Look, I ain't<br />celebrating nothing, okay?
4070608 4071942 Hey, wait a minute.<br />Hey, yo, come here.
4072026 4073318 What's the matter<br />with you?
4073403 4074945 You know? We always done this before.
4075029 4076947 We always had a good time,<br />Adrian, you know?
4077031 4078490 We don't have to<br />change nothing, never.
4078575 4080576 I mean, do you<br />remember last year
4080660 4083162 when we had fun,<br />when we had a good time?
4083830 4086749 It ain't last year, and<br />you ain't the same either.
4088835 4089877 What?
4093840 4095841 Adrian, what...<br />What did I do?
4096551 4097676 Go talk to him.
4101514 4103932 Even I could've saw<br />this thing happening.
4104017 4106101 I should have went to Miami<br />when I had the chance.
4108062 4110522 You wanna talk,<br />let's talk.
4111941 4115402 You know, I thought we was<br />supposed to be, like, like,
4115820 4117571 you know, be very close.
4117655 4118947 Hey, come on, kid.<br />I love you.
4119032 4120282 No, you don't.
4121034 4123702 Sure I do, you know? Do you<br />remember what the deal was?
4123787 4127706 We were supposed to be, like,<br />tight, like crossed fingers.
4127791 4130584 No, no, what you want is<br />you and Tommy to be tight.
4130668 4131710 That's who you're<br />really talking about.
4131795 4132795 Don't say that.
4132879 4134129 Why can't I say it?
4134214 4136632 Since he's been here, it's<br />been "Tommy this, Tommy that. "
4136716 4139551 You don't have no time for<br />nobody, so I got no time for you.
4139636 4140969 Hey, what are you<br />saying to me, kid?
4141054 4142346 You're like another person.
4142430 4144306 You're the other person!
4144390 4145891 You said I would be<br />number one to you!
4145975 4147142 You said that and you lied!
4147227 4149645 You lied to me<br />and you lied to Mom!
4149729 4151772 I never lied to you.
4151856 4153398 Tommy needed my help.
4153483 4154775 So did I.
4155527 4158737 And remember when you said to<br />watch out for scams and deceptions?
4159405 4160489 Yeah?
4161032 4163909 You're the one that<br />should have watched out.
4171000 4172668 Where you going?<br />Out.
4172752 4174545 When are you coming back?<br />Later.
4174629 4176129 Later? When?
4176214 4177339 ROCKY JR.: Later.
4181511 4183804 DUKE: Season's greetings,<br />Mrs. Balboa.
4185431 4186849 You take care<br />of these people.
4188935 4191854 Behold,<br />a Santa for all seasons!
4193606 4194982 What, are you guys lost?
4195733 4197192 Au contraire,<br />mon ami.
4197277 4199111 I know exactly where I am.
4200738 4202281 Yo, Rocko!
4202365 4204032 Guess what's<br />coming to dinner?
4204117 4206034 Tommy Gunn's<br />got new friends.
4206119 4208161 DUKE: New friends<br />for a new year.
4208538 4212457 Please. Paulie.
4212917 4215085 Nice tree. Charming.
4216212 4217921 Hey, Tommy, how you doing?
4218006 4220716 Merry Christmas, my lord.<br />Greetings!
4220967 4221925 Yeah, how you doing?
4222010 4224428 Listen, I don't wanna<br />take up too much time.
4224512 4226513 I just wanted to come by and<br />give a little season's greetings.
4226598 4227556 I don't need no presents.
4227640 4228891 Give them to the neighbors.
4228975 4231810 Look, you've done a hell of a<br />job with the man. Facts are facts.
4231895 4235230 I'd have to be blind if I didn't<br />say a title shot isn't in the cards.
4235315 4236398 Title shot?
4236482 4238984 DUKE: That's right, title shot. Now,<br />we're gonna work beautifully together.
4239068 4240319 No problems.
4240987 4242195 No friction.
4242864 4244865 Only harmony, huh?
4244949 4247242 It's time to put some<br />hustle behind this muscle.
4247327 4249578 Why, our Tommy boy here's got<br />a little something personal
4249662 4251038 to discuss with you.
4251122 4253123 So I'm gonna be<br />saying good night.
4253207 4254249 Merry Christmas.
4254334 4255459 KAREN: Merry Christmas to you.
4256127 4257836 See you soon, huh?<br />Bye.
4258963 4260714 Sorry I'm late.<br />I ended up having dinner.
4260798 4261965 Let's go.
4262050 4263842 Hey, that's okay,<br />Tommy, you know,
4263927 4266803 Adrian cooked something, but<br />it's probably all cold now.
4266888 4269389 What we can do is make<br />sandwiches. It's no big...
4269474 4270974 Rocky, I don't<br />wanna make sandwiches.
4271059 4274311 I don't wanna make... No. Tommy,<br />why did you bring him here?
4274395 4275854 He just wanted to come by.
4275939 4277731 Tommy... Rocky, do you mind<br />if I talk to you outside
4277815 4279232 about a few things?
4279317 4280859 Yeah, sure.
4281361 4282527 It's getting late.
4282612 4283779 We have to be<br />there by 10:00.
4283863 4284863 Rocky.
4284948 4286281 No, it's okay.
4289953 4292371 Hey, Tommy, what did you<br />wanna talk to me about?
4292455 4293455 Isn't it a long drive?
4293539 4294623 Yeah.
4294707 4296083 So, what do<br />you think?
4297377 4298627 Well, where'd you<br />get this from?
4298711 4299962 Duke gave it<br />to me.
4300046 4301213 Tommy!
4301756 4302839 Hey, you know,<br />maybe you ought to
4302924 4304424 give this thing back,<br />you know, Tom.
4304509 4306802 And I knew it. I knew<br />you were gonna say that.
4306886 4308136 Give it back? Why?
4308221 4310013 I mean, the guy<br />likes the way I fight.
4310098 4311807 It's almost 10:00.<br />All right. We'll make it.
4311891 4315268 I know, but, you know, you see<br />what he's doing here, Tommy?
4315353 4317604 Hey, don't let him put<br />nothing between us, okay?
4317689 4318730 We got something<br />good going here.
4318815 4319815 TOMMY: Put? Like what?
4319899 4322067 I mean, the guy was just<br />talking about getting a shot...
4322151 4324319 But we don't need him,<br />you know what I mean?
4324404 4325862 I mean,<br />you're gonna get a shot.
4325947 4328240 You're gonna be able to buy<br />10 of these things here.
4328324 4329992 Rock, when you<br />gonna wake up, man?
4330076 4331493 We're watching<br />the parade go by.
4331577 4333996 What parade?<br />What are you talking about?
4334080 4335122 What parade?<br />TOMMY: The big time.
4335206 4336331 Man, the way I'm going,<br />I'm not gonna get
4336416 4337958 a shot at the title<br />for a long time.
4338042 4339751 Now, listen, Tommy... TOMMY:<br />And I've got a perfect record.
4339836 4342504 I'm 22 and 0.<br />Where's the money? Where?
4342588 4344548 Man, we haven't made<br />any serious money yet.
4344632 4345716 And we won't<br />without the man.
4345800 4347175 I ain't talking<br />about the money.
4347260 4348635 Look, the money is<br />gonna be there, but...
4348720 4350387 I'm talking about<br />your rep, Tommy.
4350471 4352973 Look, don't sell out. Don't.<br />We don't need this guy.
4353057 4356018 Listen, Duke is a wonderful<br />man. Put the top up.
4356102 4357686 Hey, forget about<br />the top, would you?
4357770 4359396 I'm signing papers<br />with the man tomorrow.
4359480 4361106 No, listen to me, Tommy,<br />you sign them papers,
4361190 4362232 you're like his property.
4362316 4365152 You see, you got no control. You<br />know, this is a dirty business.
4365236 4367654 It's full of these thieves<br />and gangsters, you know,
4367739 4371366 and they promise every good<br />young fighter who comes along...
4371451 4375370 They promise them the world,<br />and then they suck them dry.
4375455 4376955 And they leave them when<br />they ain't worth nothing.
4377040 4378707 They leave them in the<br />gutter, broke, Tommy!
4378791 4380375 That's the way<br />this business is run.
4380460 4382878 Look, guys like Duke,<br />you know what he is?
4382962 4384838 He's a vampire.
4384922 4386715 He's living off<br />your blood, Tommy.
4386799 4389968 You know, the thing I'm trying<br />to do is what Mick done for me.
4390053 4393597 He tried to keep me away from<br />the dirty part of the business,
4393681 4395182 the way I'm trying to<br />do for you.
4395266 4397309 Man, I ain't you!<br />And you ain't Mick!
4397393 4398894 Man, when are you gonna<br />understand that?
4398978 4400687 When are you gonna understand<br />that this is a business?
4400772 4401772 In a business you need...
4401856 4402856 What, brains?
4402940 4404232 You said that, not me.
4404317 4405984 Is that what you're saying?<br />You're saying I got no brains?
4406069 4407611 Look, Rocky, you took me<br />as far as you could.
4407695 4409404 But Duke gave me my<br />title shot, you didn't.
4409489 4411031 And if you wanna keep<br />training me, then do it.
4411115 4412240 But if you don't, don't!
4412325 4413950 But it's my way or<br />it's the highway!
4415495 4416703 Tommy!
4425463 4428090 Rocky,<br />put on your coat.
4428174 4429966 Just put on your coat.
4430051 4432260 Come on.<br />It's not worth it.
4432345 4434763 Adrian, it is worth it.<br />He's just confused.
4434847 4436056 You don't see what's<br />happening under your eyes.
4436140 4437766 Yeah, I do see!<br />What... Yeah, he's...
4437850 4440018 He's twisted around by Duke.<br />I see what's happening.
4440103 4442896 No, come on, it's you, it's not<br />him. You can't live backwards.
4442980 4444481 Come on, you can't<br />turn back the clocks.
4444565 4445690 We live now,<br />we live here.
4445775 4447067 Hey, Adrian,<br />I know where we live.
4447151 4448401 What, do you think<br />I'm stupid?
4448486 4450821 I'm not as dumb<br />as you think I am!
4450905 4453198 Look, you don't think<br />I can smell it?
4453282 4454866 I see where we are.
4454951 4456618 Adrian, I don't want<br />this no more.
4456702 4457953 I want something<br />good for the family.
4458037 4459538 I don't want this.
4459622 4460997 I don't want this!
4461082 4462958 I mean, did I come<br />back here and get my
4463042 4464876 brains beat out for<br />these guys to say,
4464961 4466878 "Hey, there goes Balboa"?
4466963 4469381 I'm just another bum<br />in the neighborhood!
4469465 4470799 I didn't want this!
4470883 4473593 No, come on.<br />Nobody says that!
4473678 4475720 I'm saying it, Adrian.<br />I'm saying this.
4475805 4476972 I'm saying this.
4477849 4479808 When that kid was in the ring,<br />you know what I was doing?
4479892 4480934 I was winning.
4481018 4482144 When he was winning,<br />I was winning.
4482228 4484062 You were winning?<br />Yeah. It was...
4484147 4485856 It was like...<br />It was my last chance
4485940 4487482 at getting some<br />respect for us.
4487567 4489317 Do you know that?<br />Come on, I respect you.
4489402 4491611 I respect you. Yes, I do. It's<br />gone! You can't respect me.
4491696 4493280 I don't respect myself.<br />No, you can't do it!
4493364 4494364 I do!<br />Don't tell me that.
4494448 4496825 All those beatings<br />you took in the ring.
4496909 4498535 I took them with you.
4499078 4500287 I know how you feel.
4500371 4503915 I know when somebody like Tommy<br />comes along, you feel alive.
4504584 4507002 But he's not you. He<br />doesn't have your heart.
4507086 4511506 All those fighters you beat, you<br />beat 'em with heart, not muscle.
4511591 4512799 That's what Mickey knew.
4512884 4515051 That's why you and<br />Mickey were special.
4515136 4516803 But Mickey's dead!
4517513 4521099 If there's something you want to<br />pass on, pass it on to your son.
4521184 4524436 For God's sakes,<br />your son is lost.
4525271 4526563 He needs you!
4527565 4530317 I know Tommy<br />makes you feel great.
4530401 4533111 He makes you feel<br />like you're winning again.
4533196 4535614 But you're losing us!
4535698 4538074 Rocky, you're losing<br />your family!
4545791 4547125 I'm sorry.
4548211 4550378 You know it was<br />always you and me.
4550463 4552422 It was always you and me.
4554800 4556468 I'm sorry, Adrian.
4559555 4561681 I don't know<br />about you guys,
4562183 4564309 but I gotta get<br />out of here.
4565978 4567896 Hey, what do you say<br />we go to the shore?
4567980 4569064 Yeah, let's go.
4569148 4570732 Yeah, great. How are we gonna get there?
4570816 4572108 What do you mean<br />how we gonna get there?
4572193 4574486 We throw our thumbs in<br />the air. We'll hitchhike.
4575112 4576238 Yo.
4576322 4577822 What's he want?
4577907 4579282 You want me to<br />stay with you?
4579367 4580408 No.
4580493 4583203 Yeah, right. I got enough<br />problems with my old man. Come on.
4585331 4586915 You ain't gonna<br />hit him, are you?
4586999 4589167 No, I ain't gonna<br />hit him. No.
4590920 4593797 Yo, kid,<br />when you start smoking?
4593881 4595966 I don't know.<br />Didn't you ever smoke?
4596050 4598385 Yeah, I done a lot of<br />bad things, you know?
4599887 4600971 So?
4602765 4605642 So, I...<br />You know, I wised up.
4605726 4608645 Okay, so maybe I'll<br />wise up someday, too.
4610731 4613275 Maybe tonight's<br />a good night for
4613359 4615902 both of us to start<br />this wising-up thing.
4616779 4617862 Hey, don't worry about it.
4617947 4619322 I gotta worry about it.
4619407 4621908 I mean, the deal was we were<br />supposed to be tight, right?
4621993 4624244 What about Tommy?<br />You tight with him too, huh?
4626414 4627580 Tommy.
4632128 4633503 Yeah, well.
4634964 4636715 That was yesterday,<br />you know?
4641012 4642512 You know, kid,
4643222 4645348 you remember you were<br />telling me a long time ago
4645433 4646683 about deceptions,
4646767 4649269 and I was talking to you<br />about scams and...
4649353 4652230 I should have listened to<br />you. I was trying to teach you.
4653024 4656818 All right? But you, you were<br />teaching me and I didn't wise up.
4656902 4660905 And I didn't know, and I made<br />mistakes, and I do things, you know.
4662825 4664492 It bothers me, you know?
4664577 4665910 I forget a lot of things.
4666495 4669372 I... Just...
4671584 4673001 You know, I...
4679925 4681343 Hey, kid.
4683179 4686097 I know I made a few mistakes,<br />you know? It's...
4687350 4689517 But I would love to<br />hang out with you again.
4689977 4691519 Just you and me.
4695733 4699944 I swear to God, it's just<br />gonna be you and me this time.
4702865 4704240 Home team?
4706577 4709287 Yeah, home team.
4712458 4714250 ROCKY: Hey, kid,<br />you wanna hear a joke?
4714335 4715752 ROCKY JR.:<br />Yeah, sure. Why not?
4716379 4717670 Knock, knock.
4717755 4719005 Who's there?
4719090 4720298 Tuna fish.
4720383 4722050 Tuna fish who?
4722134 4725845 You can tune a piano,<br />but you cannot tune a fish.
4725930 4727889 Well,<br />you're getting better.
4727973 4729974 Yeah,<br />that's a good one.
4736273 4738983 All right, folks. Lock<br />the door and hide the kids.
4739068 4741277 It's time to wage war!
4743781 4744948 ANNOUNCER ON TV:<br />Tommy Gunn has been said
4745032 4747158 to be such a student<br />of Rocky Balboa's style,
4747243 4749744 he's been nicknamed by<br />the press the Clone Ranger.
4749829 4751621 DUKE ON TV:<br />In the red corner...
4751705 4754165 Relax, Rocko. He ain't worth the stress.
4754250 4757085 It ain't him, Paulie.<br />It ain't him.
4757169 4758169 Turbo-charged.
4758254 4762006 Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!
4762091 4763341 Tommy Gunn.
4767596 4770223 ANNOUNCER ON TV: Boy, looks like<br />the fans are unhappy with Tommy Gunn
4770307 4772142 for leaving<br />Rocky Balboa behind.
4772810 4775895 Yeah, of course. He's<br />nobody's sweetheart, that kid.
4775980 4780066 DUKE: Weighing in at 242<br />very impressive pounds,
4780484 4786865 the present world heavyweight<br />champion, Union Cane!
4788200 4789826 Looks like he's in great<br />shape, don't he, Paulie?
4789910 4790952 Yeah.
4791036 4792704 ANNOUNCER ON TV: And the<br />referee, Capaccito, calling
4792788 4794414 both fighters to<br />the center of the ring.
4794498 4796624 Whoa, Tommy, you're<br />looking... He's a little tight.
4796709 4798668 He's nervous, you know?
4798752 4801629 Like the way I felt when I was<br />fighting with Apollo, you know?
4801714 4804132 Rocko, he ain't you.<br />Hardly ever was, that kid.
4804216 4805758 Hey, come on. Give<br />him a break, would you?
4813142 4815393 All right, come on, Tommy.<br />Do what you was told.
4815478 4817770 In and out, side to side.<br />Don't eat the jab.
4821233 4822775 Get off the ropes!<br />What are you, blind?
4824987 4826946 Well, he's getting hit with<br />everything but the ring posts.
4827031 4828781 Come on, Cane. Let's<br />rumble. Go for it, Cane.
4828866 4832285 ROCKY: Come on, Tommy, what's<br />the matter with you? That's it!
4837917 4839042 That's it!
4839919 4842462 Slip the jab, move.<br />Move that, side to side.
4842546 4843880 Back and forth,<br />like a metronome.
4843964 4845507 Slip, slide, glide.
4845591 4846966 That's it!
4851180 4852305 Jab!
4860314 4862941 You see what...<br />He remembers everything.
4863817 4865151 All right.<br />Come on, Tommy.
4865236 4866736 I'm in there, man.<br />Do what I'm doing.
4866820 4869656 Do what I'm doing. Back and<br />forth, side to side, that's it!
4875120 4876120 Come on! Come on!
4876205 4878373 Come on, kid! Don't let<br />him up! Don't let him up!
4878457 4880250 Roll, roll, roll!
4885297 4886631 Dig, dig!
4897101 4898810 Got him! He's down!<br />The heavyweight champion
4898894 4900186 Union Cane is down!
4903023 4906150 REFEREE: One, two, three,
4906235 4907318 four.
4907403 4908528 Five.

4914994 4916077 Yeah!
4916161 4917662 Yo! Yo!
4917746 4919747 The heavyweight champion,<br />Tommy...
4921834 4922875 Yeah!
4924336 4927380 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />by way of a knockout,
4927464 4932844 we have a new champion,<br />Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.
4936849 4939601 REPORTER ON TV: Congratulations.<br />A sensational upset victory.
4939685 4942270 And you're now the champion<br />of the world. How do you feel?
4942354 4943730 Never better.<br />I mean, I don't know
4943814 4945148 what's wrong with<br />these people, but...
4945232 4949277 Because you're not a champion.<br />You're a crumb bug dirtbag.
4949361 4950528 ROCKY: Hey, come on,<br />Paul, give him a break.
4950613 4953823 He did something wonderful.
4953907 4956451 Long live the king!<br />Yes!
4956535 4957619 I'd like to say thank you.
4957703 4960455 I'd like to thank the<br />man that made this happen,
4960539 4962290 and I'd like to thank the<br />man who made me believe
4962374 4963791 that all this<br />could happen,
4963876 4966127 the man who's been like<br />an angel on my shoulder,
4966211 4967754 Mr. George Washington Duke!
4967838 4968880 Yeah!
4970716 4972008 ANNOUNCER:<br />And there you have it.
4972092 4975887 A new champion of the world,<br />Tommy "The Machine" Gunn.
4975971 4978640 Boy, I'll tell you, a big<br />surprise, at least to me,
4978724 4980767 that the new champion<br />thanked Duke
4980851 4982101 instead of the guy<br />that got him here.
4982186 4983144 Yeah.
4983228 4984479 This crowd is unhappy.
4984563 4989442 CROWD:<br />Rocky! Rocky! Rocky! Rocky!
4989526 4991361 Rocko, too much TV<br />is bad for the eyes.
4991445 4993029 No, my eyes are okay,<br />Paulie. Sit.
4994031 4995990 Well, too much TV<br />is bad for my ears.
4996075 4997200 Yeah.
4997785 4999786 Hey, hi, slugger.<br />Good fight, huh?
4999912 5001204 It's okay, dad.
5001288 5003706 You're the real champ around<br />here. I made this for you.
5003791 5005124 Yeah?
5006168 5007502 Beautiful.
5008754 5011339 Rocko, let's put our teeth<br />around a few brews, okay?
5011423 5012632 I could use the company.
5012716 5014092 ADRIAN: Sure.<br />Yeah, good idea.
5016136 5017845 Think I should go out<br />with your uncle Paulie?
5017930 5019055 If I can watch TV.
5019139 5021641 Yeah, hey, okay,<br />listen.
5021725 5023184 Yeah, you can<br />watch TV, okay?
5023268 5024519 But don't stay up too late.
5024603 5025937 You gotta get<br />them bones growing.
5026021 5027772 All right.<br />Okay.
5029400 5031317 Wow, what a fight.<br />That was something.
5031402 5032860 Yeah, something.
5032945 5034028 Jeez.
5034113 5035530 I told you you could<br />give him everything
5035614 5037990 but you can't<br />give him your heart.
5038075 5040243 It's okay, Adrian,<br />really.
5040327 5041327 Yeah?
5041412 5042870 Yeah, it's all right.
5044164 5048209 It's... Hey, kid, don't<br />you stay up too late, okay?
5049461 5050795 That was some fight.
5052423 5053965 Are you okay?
5054049 5055299 Sure.
5057219 5058970 I won't be out too late.<br />Okay.
5060097 5061389 See you, champ.
5061473 5064308 Yeah, yeah. Have a good<br />time with Uncle Paulie.
5064393 5065810 Yeah, sure.
5071984 5073943 Ladies and gentlemen, let<br />me present to you the newest,
5074027 5076404 the youngest heavyweight<br />champion of all time,
5076488 5078698 Tommy "The Machine" Gunn!
5078782 5080324 Yeah!
5080409 5082076 Do you think<br />the fight was too easy?
5082161 5083995 He hit me a few good shots.<br />But I was never hurt.
5084079 5086205 I mean, I'm just glad<br />to be the champ. Yeah!
5086290 5088124 Tommy, don't you think<br />that this looked more like
5088208 5089917 a Philadelphia<br />sparring session at times
5090002 5091711 instead of<br />a championship match?
5091795 5093045 It didn't look like<br />you broke a sweat.
5093130 5094589 DUKE: Yeah,<br />you're very observant.
5094673 5096716 Union Cane wasn't<br />feeling that good.
5096800 5099135 But Tommy Gunn would<br />have done the same thing
5099219 5101471 if Union was 100%.<br />Next.
5101555 5104932 100%? He fought like he didn't<br />have a heartbeat. Come on!
5105017 5106976 Everybody knows that Cane<br />is just a paper champion.
5107060 5108436 What does he mean<br />by "paper champion"?
5108520 5110521 It means Cane's title<br />was manufactured.
5110606 5111773 He never won it from Balboa.
5111857 5114066 Gentlemen, give the boy a<br />break. Union Cane is for real.
5114151 5115526 Tommy, you ever think<br />you're gonna get out
5115611 5117111 from underneath<br />Rocky Balboa's shadow?
5117196 5118988 Man, I won the title.<br />What more do I have to do?
5119072 5120573 REPORTER: I'll tell you<br />what you have to do,
5120657 5122575 you've gotta fight some<br />real opponents, right?
5122701 5125119 Balboa fought them all.<br />But I beat the best tonight.
5125204 5126788 The best? The best?<br />This guy's a bum.
5126872 5128664 He doesn't even deserve<br />a shot at the title.
5128749 5130249 Gentlemen,<br />whoa, whoa, whoa.
5130334 5131417 We're getting carried away.
5131502 5134212 Now, Union Cane was the<br />recognized champ. Next question.
5134296 5136881 We know the rating system<br />can be manipulated.
5136965 5139801 The bottom line is Tommy Gunn<br />beat a second-rate fighter
5139885 5142303 with so much glass in his jaw,<br />he ought to be a chandelier.
5142387 5143471 DUKE: Say what you want,
5143555 5146182 but this man will prove<br />to be a great champion.
5146266 5149393 He might win a few fights, but<br />a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.
5149478 5150853 No, no, no.
5150938 5152605 He's no Rocky Balboa.<br />Let's face it.
5152689 5153815 There is only one Balboa.
5153899 5156067 Now, Balboa was<br />a true people's champion.
5156151 5157860 But in time,<br />Tommy Gunn may be
5157945 5159987 able to fill his shoes.<br />Next question.
5160072 5162615 REPORTER: Not by fighting<br />stiffs like Cane, he won't.
5162699 5164325 Man, I'll fight anybody anywhere!
5164409 5167161 Who? When? When are you<br />gonna fight a real fighter?
5167246 5168871 Gentlemen, gentlemen,<br />gentlemen, come on.
5168956 5171833 We want to thank you for coming<br />tonight, and we'll look forward...
5171917 5174085 Hey, Tommy,<br />I got something for you.
5174169 5176671 For your next fight, why don't you<br />fight the redhead in the front row?
5176797 5178256 I hear she comes<br />real cheap.
5179925 5183594 We look forward to seeing you<br />at Tommy Gunn's next fight.
5184179 5186180 Why the hell did you say<br />Balboa was better, man?
5186265 5187640 Do you believe he's better?<br />Of course not.
5187724 5188933 But we can't<br />talk in here, huh?
5189017 5190184 You the champ.<br />You the champ.
5190269 5192103 REPORTER: Who are you gonna<br />fight for the next fight, Tommy?
5192980 5194772 TOMMY: Man, what the hell<br />happened in there?
5194857 5197275 I won the damn title, and<br />these people think I'm a bum!
5197359 5199026 Man, why didn't you<br />take up for me in there?
5199111 5200695 Listen to me, when the press<br />is right, they're right.
5200779 5202446 Right? Man, I'm as good<br />as Balboa ever was.
5202531 5203698 I don't give a damn<br />about what they say.
5203782 5205324 And I'm tired of being<br />called a damn robot, too!
5205409 5206993 Listen to me, Tommy Gunn.<br />You can't fight the press.
5207077 5208077 I can't fight the press.
5208161 5209203 Oh, God!
5209288 5212248 As long as they got Balboa on<br />the brain, he'll always be champ.
5212332 5213374 The man fought<br />wars in the ring.
5213458 5214417 Tommy, face facts.
5214501 5216168 You're in his shadow. I don't<br />know if there's any way out.
5216253 5217253 This is your own man talking!
5217337 5218504 No, no, no!<br />Listen to me.
5218589 5220506 There's a way for you to<br />get the respect you deserve,
5220591 5223634 but what you've got to do is<br />challenge Balboa to fight man-to-man.
5223719 5225261 That's right. George here<br />could set this fight up abroad
5225345 5226679 in a matter of weeks.
5226763 5228180 Yeah, it'd be the greatest fight ever.
5228265 5229473 Teacher against student.
5229558 5231517 Old lion against young lion.
5231602 5233436 And it's the only way you're<br />ever gonna get peace of mind,
5233520 5234729 'cause believe me<br />when I tell you
5234813 5237023 that press is gonna hound you<br />with that man's legend
5237107 5239317 for as long as you dare<br />to wear boxing gloves.
5239401 5241611 You've got to get him<br />into that ring, Tommy Gunn,
5241695 5243404 or you're gonna be hearing<br />questions like you heard tonight
5243488 5244572 for the rest of your life.
5244656 5247074 Then you're gonna start to ask<br />yourself, "Could I really take him?
5247159 5248409 "Am I really good enough?
5248493 5250578 "Do people really think<br />I'm a cheap carbon copy
5250662 5252246 "or a second-rate<br />pretender who only
5252331 5255041 "got a shot<br />because of my skin tone?"
5255417 5257793 You've got to challenge that<br />man to fight, Tommy Gunn.
5257878 5260254 And if he refuses,<br />then you gotta insult him!
5260339 5262798 You gotta dog him.<br />You gotta humiliate him.
5262883 5265051 You gotta do whatever you got<br />to do to get him into that ring,
5265135 5266969 but that's what<br />you got to do.
5272434 5275519 ROCKY: Okay, blast off.<br />Rolling silver.
5275604 5278940 And down. Yo, Andy! Andy,<br />flippers ain't flipping. Yo, Andy.
5279024 5280733 ANDY: Hey, that machine<br />cost me a fortune.
5280817 5283444 Yeah, well, it's costing me<br />a fortune, too, you know?
5283528 5285446 DUKE: Rocky Balboa.
5285530 5286489 What the hell<br />was that?
5286573 5289951 Rocky Balboa, there's a man out<br />here wishing to speak with you.

5294081 5295623 Rocko, you know who that is?
5295707 5296832 MAN: Ain't that the Duke?

5320440 5322942 You're coming down here<br />with these people,
5323026 5324026 asking me if I wanna
5324111 5325820 throw hands with you?<br />Is that what this is about?
5325904 5326904 TOMMY: Yeah,<br />that's what it's about.
5326989 5329532 And I ain't nobody's<br />robot! Nobody's boy!
5329616 5331617 Now, are you accepting the<br />challenge, or are you yellow?

5350846 5353973 Hey! Man, I ain't through<br />talking with you yet.
5354057 5356851 Hey, look, Tommy, I ain't got<br />no more to say to you, okay?
5356935 5358561 Look, I just wanted good<br />things for you, all right?
5358645 5360521 Hell you did. Man, you were<br />only in this for the money.

5361690 5362690 Yeah, I'm tired of walking<br />around in your shadow, man,
5362774 5363899 people calling me<br />your robot.
5363984 5366360 You thought I was in this<br />for the money, Tommy?
5366445 5368863 You know, we were supposed<br />to be like brothers, you know?
5368947 5370072 You don't remember that?
5370157 5372742 You don't know this, but you<br />got a deception going here.
5372826 5375369 This guy here. He was<br />using you for the bait.
5375454 5377204 He wants to get you<br />and me in the ring.
5377289 5379248 That's what he wants, us to<br />fight each other, you know?
5379332 5380583 To make the money, right?
5380667 5382168 He don't care<br />about you, Tommy.
5382252 5384128 He don't care about me<br />neither, right?
5384212 5386756 Come on, come on. Enough of<br />the fantasy. Let's talk reality.
5386840 5390634 Rocky Balboa, are you prepared<br />to accept Tommy Gunn's challenge?
5390719 5392053 Tommy.<br />DUKE: All right.

5397309 5398726 TOMMY: This ain't<br />none of your business!
5398810 5400394 Ain't none of my business?<br />Hey, come on, Paulie.
5400479 5401604 Ain't none of my business?
5401688 5403647 Paulie, forget about it.<br />The man spit blood for you,
5403732 5405357 put you ahead of<br />his own family,
5405442 5409320 and you bring these rat bums<br />around here and kill his dignity?
5409404 5411906 Rocko made you your shot, you<br />know that? He's the real champ.
5411990 5413574 You're just a goddamn joke.
