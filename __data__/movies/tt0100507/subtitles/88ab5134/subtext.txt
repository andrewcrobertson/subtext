26520 29990 Go to the body, Tommy. That's it.
31120 34795 Sam, you OK? Hey, Tommy Gunn!<br />You got some guns, don't ya?
51640 54279 Drive through it. Go on now.
62960 64598 And ten. You can do it.
67840 70673 You got it. Come on, bring it up.
70800 73189 <i>I got you this time!</i>
84480 87313 Tommy, these trunks is<br />very special to me, you know?
89960 90710 Dig!
99280 101510 Way to go, kid! That was great.
101640 103790 Tommy! Tommy!
113280 113837 All right.
124200 129320 - l beat the man. l don't believe it.<br />- You sure did. You're very swift, Tommy.
138800 144113 Yeah, Merlin. Listen, l got an idea.<br />l think we can finally nail Balboa.
148360 149873 They're waitin' again.
150000 152514 - lf you want, l got almost a dollar.<br />- Save it.
152640 156349 - Slummin' again, bimbo?<br />- Hey, what you got in the bag?
156480 160473 Hey, stupid! What, you not talkin' to me?<br />l'll pound your teeth out.
160600 164115 - Go for it.<br />- What'd he say? Punk's losin' his mind.
164240 166515 - What'd you say?<br />- Go for it!
183840 186308 Come on! Put up your hands.
186440 188795 No way. l didn't like him anyway.
191960 194599 l think that belongs to me.
194720 198076 Robert! Robert!
198200 200794 lf you wanna end this, let's end it now.
200920 204754 Yeah, l got no problem with that.<br />See you later.
204880 206916 l can't believe it.
207040 209634 - Are you gonna tell your dad?<br />- Yeah.
211840 214195 Good. That's it. One more time.
215280 217748 Look, you're doin' great at combinations,
217880 221555 but you gotta learn to move<br />side to side like a windshield wiper
221680 224911 - so you ain't gettin' hit with the jabs.<br />- Dad!
225040 227998 l got my coat back! Look, l got my coat.
228120 230475 Oh, that's great, kid. That's beautiful.
230600 234354 l trashed this guy. Everybody<br />in the school went crazy. Everybody!
234480 238268 - Rocky, l'm coolin' down over here.<br />- l gotta get back with Tommy.
238400 243428 He's coolin' down. But go tell your mom.<br />She'd like to hear that. That's beautiful.
243560 246120 OK, let's go, Tommy.
246240 248390 Lookin' good.
248800 251155 Look at Tommy go!
261960 264679 - You think l have a chance at that?<br />- Absolutely.
264800 270079 Tommy, anybody who's got two fists<br />and a good heartbeat, they got a chance.
277640 279039 You're out!
308400 311676 Boy, you got hands of gold.<br />l want to introduce somebody.
367440 369829 That's it. lt's over.
375440 376759 Back him up.
383360 385828 - That's it!<br />- There's your boat, Rocks.
385960 388315 - What boat?<br />- The one that's sinking.
403200 405475 Tommy Gunn at the top.
406520 408636 You come with the Duke,
408760 413231 you can get the kind of payday fights<br />Balboa could only dream about.
413360 415749 To the victor goes the spoils.
424640 426596 Slip the jab, Tommy!
431480 433118 Yes.
433480 435948 You're out!
437600 441559 - You did great, kid! You did it!<br />- <i>Now</i> am l gonna get a shot at the title?
441680 444035 - Yeah, you will real soon.<br />- Tommy, over here!
444160 445559 Hey, baby! How are you?
445680 447796 The winner, at two minutes ten seconds...
447920 450434 So Rocky, when's Tommy<br />up against Union Cane?
450560 453677 - We gotta talk about that.<br />- Get a life, will ya?
453800 457315 - Rocko, he ain't worth it, buddy.<br />- He fought a great fight.
457440 460000 Your ship has sunk, Rocko. lt's sunk.
476320 479073 Must be hung up in traffic.<br />He should have been here by now.
479200 480997 - Why?<br />- lt's Christmas.
481120 484715 - He should be here with his family.<br />- Maybe he doesn't think it is his family.
484840 488355 Sure it is. Yo, Adrian, look at this.
490440 493557 l wanna give this to him.<br />What do you think?
493680 495750 l think you've given enough.
495880 498997 Hey, come on, Adrian.<br />He's given us some things too.
499120 503033 He's given us like a second shot, right?<br />Come on, it's Christmas.
506520 509717 Only in America.<br />Havin' the best and wearin' the best.
509840 513196 - But you gotta stay on top.<br />- Nobody remembers number two.
513320 516915 - l sure don't.<br />- l checked with the boxing commission.
517040 521352 lt seems there's no formal contract<br />between you and Balboa.
521480 523436 No, nothing. Just a handshake.
523560 528759 This is a complex business. You got to<br />stay sharp. l don't have to tell you that.
528880 532714 lt's hard livin' in Rocky's shadow,<br />people callin' you his puppet.
532840 534478 No one else could do it so long.
534600 538957 Tommy, l'm afraid that if you<br />keep goin' the way you're goin',
539080 542231 you're gonna be<br />watchin' the parade go by.
542360 545830 - Exactly.<br />- You haven't had the big payday yet.
545960 550954 And you won't until you fight those<br />top contenders that l do surely own.
551600 553875 l got the contracts.
554000 556116 lt's a complex business.
556240 558879 But if you want the best, go with the best.
559000 561560 - What about Rocky?<br />- Rocky can still train you.
561680 566276 My God, he's done a wonderful job.<br />Now look, here's $20,000.
566400 568755 Take it as an advance.
569800 573918 Time to put some hustle<br />behind this muscle. Merry Christmas.
574040 575996 Merry Christmas.
577360 579920 Stop the presses!<br />Yo, Adrian, l can't believe it.
580040 584352 Just come up on the roof, will you?<br />He just landed there and crashed.
584480 588109 - Who do you think it is?<br />- Do l hear reindeer on my roof?
588240 589912 You know...
590040 593237 Antlers. Unbelievable. lt's like a billion...
594240 596834 Come on. Look who's here.<br />You know this guy!
596960 599474 - You got a weird family.<br />- Don't l know?
599600 604833 lt's gonna be next Christmas before he<br />gets down. Hey, put it together for Santa!
604960 608396 - Merry Xmas. Yo, yo, yo!<br />- l don't think you got it right, Santa.
608520 612433 - No, no, no. lt's ''ho, ho, ho!''<br />- What's the freakin' difference?
612560 616712 - Where l come from it's ''yo, yo, yo!''<br />- Looks like we got a 90 proof Santa.
616840 620958 Hey, Santa, tell all the kids<br />what you've got in the bag for them
621080 624390 - that you brought from the north.<br />- l got my laundry.
624520 627796 - No, you got the wrong bag.<br />- Come on, Chubby. Get outta the way.
627920 630229 Let Santa sit down. Come here, little boy.
630360 632794 - You been nice?<br />- Uncle Paulie!
632920 636913 - Kid, why not tell Santa what you need?<br />- He's stretchin' the clothes, man.
637040 640874 - l don't need nothin'.<br />- Come on, kid. Tell Santa what you want.
641000 644151 That ain't Santa.<br />lt's Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.
644280 646874 What do you mean?<br />Why are you talkin' like that?
647000 651039 We're just tryin' to have a good time.<br />Santa's here and everythin'.
651160 653276 lt's stupid.
653400 657632 Yo, you know... Come on, it ain't stupid.<br />We're just tryin' to pretend here.
657760 662390 You see, you're supposed to be<br />pretending. lt's like this game, right?
662520 664988 l don't like pretending.<br />You guys talk to him.
665120 668999 Hey, kid, l ain't talkin' to them.<br />l'm talking with <i>you</i> here.
669120 672351 See, it's very important that<br />you spend time with the family
672480 677031 and have a good time and just get the<br />spirit goin', you know? lt's good, right?
677160 679515 Good for what? Come on, let's go.
680800 683155 His friends are here. He doesn't want to.
683280 686955 - Adrian, l know what he wants.<br />- How do you know what l want?
687080 689719 - Cos l know you.<br />- You know me?
689840 691796 He thinks he knows me.
693240 697791 - Look, l ain't celebratin' nothin', OK?<br />- Hey, wait. What's the matter with you?
697920 702596 We always done this before. We always<br />had a good time. lt don't have to change.
702720 707350 Do you remember last year, when<br />we had fun, when we had a good time?
707480 710677 lt ain't last year and<br />you ain't the same, either.
712320 714754 What?!
716920 719593 Adrian, what did l do?
719720 721676 Go talk to him.
724400 726550 Even l coulda saw this thing happenin'.
726680 729592 l shoulda went to Miami<br />when l had the chance.
730800 733234 You wanna talk? Let's talk.
734280 738034 Well, you know,<br />l thought we was supposed to be like...
738160 741072 You know, be very close.<br />Hey, come on, kid. l love you.
741200 743156 No, you don't.
743280 745748 Sure l do. Remember what the deal was?
745880 749589 We was supposed to be tight,<br />like crossed fingers.
749720 753429 You want you and Tommy to be tight.<br />That's what you're talkin' about.
753560 755630 - Oh, don't say that!<br />- Why can't l say it?
755760 758035 Since he came<br />it's Tommy this, Tommy that.
758160 760913 You got no time for nobody,<br />so l got no time for you.
761040 763713 What are you sayin'?<br />You're like another person.
763840 768277 <i>You're</i> the other person. You said l would<br />be number one to you and you lied.
768400 770391 You lied to me and you lied to Mom.
770720 773871 l never lied to you.<br />Tommy needed my help.
774320 776151 So did l.
776280 779909 And remember when you said to<br />watch out for scams and deceptions?
780040 781393 Yeah?
781520 784273 You're the one that shoulda watched out.
791120 792633 - Where are you going?<br />- Out.
792760 794432 - When'll you be back?<br />- Later.
794560 796516 - Later? When?<br />- Later.
801080 803514 Season's greetings, Mrs Balboa.
804840 807274 You take care of these people.
808320 811153 Behold the Santa for all seasons!
812800 814791 Are you guys lost?
814920 818117 <i>Au contraire, mon ami.</i><br />l know exactly where l am.
819760 824675 Yo, Rocko! Guess what's comin' to<br />dinner. Tommy Gunn's got new friends.
824800 826836 New friends for a new year!
827320 830278 Oh, please. Oh, Paulie!
831280 833510 Nice tree. Charming.
834480 838951 - Hey, Tommy. How you doin'?<br />- Merry Christmas, milord. Greetings!
839080 840991 - Yeah, how you doin'?<br />- Listen.
841120 844476 l don't want to take up too much time.<br />Season's greetings.
844600 848036 - Don't need no presents.<br />- You've done a helluva job with the man.
848160 852711 Facts are facts. l'd have to be blind<br />if l didn't see a title shot on the cards.
852840 855832 - Title shot?<br />- Right. We'll work beautifully together.
855960 858155 No problems.
858280 863718 No friction. Only harmony, huh? lt's time<br />to put some hustle behind this muscle.
864440 867830 Tommy-boy's got a little something<br />personal to discuss with you.
867960 870918 So l'm gonna be sayin' good night.<br />Merry Christmas.
871040 873998 - Merry Christmas to you.<br />- See you soon, huh?
875400 877789 Sorry l'm late.<br />l got hung up having dinner.
878200 882637 Hey, that's OK, Tommy. Adrian cooked<br />something, but it's probably all cold.
882760 887834 - What we can do is make sandwiches.<br />- Rocky, l don't wanna make sandwiches.
887960 890155 Tommy, why did you bring him here?
890280 894717 He just wanted to come by. Rocky, mind<br />if l talk to you outside about a few things?
894840 896796 Oh, yeah. Sure.
896920 899229 lt's getting late.<br />We have to be there by ten.
899360 901715 - Rocky...<br />- No, it's OK.
905080 907435 Hey, Tommy, what you wanna talk about?
907560 909551 - lsn't it a long drive?<br />- Yeah.
909680 912319 So what do you think?
912440 914670 - Where'd you get this?<br />- Duke gave it to me.
914800 916472 Tommy!
916600 919319 Hey, maybe you oughta<br />give this thing back.
919440 921431 Man, l knew it! l knew you'd say that.
921560 924199 Give it back? Why?<br />He likes the way l fight.
924320 926276 - lt's almost ten.<br />- We'll make it.
926400 928595 l know, but you see what he's doing here?
928720 932349 Tommy, hey, don't let him<br />put nothin' between us, OK?
932480 935995 Put like what? The guy was<br />just talkin' about gettin' a shot.
936120 939476 Look, we don't need him.<br />l mean, you're gonna get a shot.
939600 941556 You'll be able to buy ten of these.
941680 944797 When you gonna wake up?<br />We're watching the parade go by.
944920 947514 What parade? What are you talkin' about?
947640 951394 The big time. The way l'm goin',<br />l won't get a shot for a long time.
951520 954830 l've got a perfect record.<br />l'm 22 and 0. Where's the money?
954960 958635 Where? We haven't made serious money.<br />And we won't without the man.
958760 963436 l ain't talkin' about money. lt'll be there.<br />l'm talkin' about your rep, Tommy.
963560 967838 - Don't sell out. We don't need this guy.<br />- Listen. Duke is a wonderful man.
967960 970110 - Put the top up.<br />- Forget about the top!
970240 974756 - l'm signin' papers with him tomorrow.<br />- You sign them, you're like his property.
974880 979635 You got no control. This is a dirty<br />business, full of thieves and gangsters.
979760 985596 They promise every good young fighter<br />who comes by, they promise the world.
985720 989952 And then they suck 'em dry and<br />they leave 'em in the gutter broke.
990080 992116 That's the way this business is run.
992240 997268 Guys like Duke... You know what he is?<br />He's a vampire. He's livin' off your blood.
997400 1001029 Tommy, you know, the thing l'm<br />tryin' to do is what Mick done for me.
1001160 1004516 He tried to keep me away from<br />the dirty part of the business,
1004640 1008155 - the way l'm tryin' to do for you.<br />- l ain't you and you ain't Mick.
1008280 1012398 When are you gonna understand this is<br />a business? And in business you need...
1012520 1014909 - What, brains?<br />- You said that, not me.
1015040 1019670 - You saying l got no brains?<br />- Duke gave me my title shot, you didn't.
1019800 1022439 lf you wanna keep trainin' me, do it.<br />lf not, don't.
1022560 1024994 But it's my way or it's the highway.
1025640 1026959 Tommy!
1035160 1037628 Rocky, put on your coat.
1037760 1041639 Just put on your coat.<br />Come on. lt's not worth it.
1041760 1043955 Adrian, it is worth it. He's just confused.
1044080 1046833 - You don't see what's happening.<br />- Yeah, l do see!
1046960 1050350 - He's twisted around by Duke.<br />- Come on, it's you. lt's not him.
1050480 1054598 You can't live backwards or turn back<br />the clocks. We live now. We live here.
1054720 1057518 Hey, l know where we live.<br />Do you think l'm stupid?
1057640 1059596 l'm not as dumb as you think l am.
1059720 1063349 l look. You don't think l can smell it?<br />l see where we are.
1063480 1067871 l don't want this no more. l want<br />somethin' good for the family, not this!
1068000 1072232 l don't want this! Did l come back here<br />and get my brains beat out
1072360 1077275 for these guys to say ''There goes Balboa,<br />just another bum in the neighbourhood''?
1077400 1081188 - l didn't want this!<br />- No! Come on, nobody says that.
1081320 1085313 l'm sayin' it, Adrian.<br />l'm sayin' this. l'm sayin' this.
1085440 1089319 When that kid was in the ring,<br />you know what l was doin'? l was winnin'.
1089440 1091396 - You were winning?<br />- Yeah.
1091520 1094751 lt was my last chance to get<br />some respect for us, you know?
1094880 1098111 - Come on. l respect you.<br />- You can't respect me.
1098240 1101232 - Yes, l do.<br />- No, you can't! Don't tell me that.
1101360 1106878 All those beatings you took in the ring,<br />l took them with you. l know how you feel.
1107000 1110879 l know when somebody like<br />Tommy comes along, you feel alive.
1111000 1113434 But he's not you.<br />He doesn't have your heart.
1113560 1118873 All those fighters you beat, you beat 'em<br />with heart, not muscle. Mickey knew that.
1119000 1123357 That's why you and Mickey were special.<br />But Mickey's dead.
1123480 1128474 lf there's something you wanna pass on,<br />pass it on to your son, for God's sakes!
1128600 1130670 Your son is lost.
1130800 1132995 He needs <i>you.</i>
1133120 1138399 l know Tommy makes you feel great. He<br />makes you feel like you're winning again.
1138520 1140750 But you're losing us.
1140880 1143553 Rocky, you're losing your family!
1150560 1152835 l'm sorry.
1152960 1156919 You know, it was always you and me.<br />lt was always you and me.
1159240 1161196 l'm sorry, Adrian.
1163400 1165311 l don't know about you guys...
1166400 1168356 but l gotta get outta here.
1169960 1173191 - What do you say we go to the shore?<br />- Oh, yeah, great!
1173320 1175834 - How are we gonna get there?<br />- What do you mean?
1175960 1178554 We throw our thumbs<br />in the air and hitchhike.
1178680 1181194 - Yo!<br />- Oh, what's he want?
1181320 1183788 - You want me to stay with you?<br />- No.
1183920 1187595 You're right. l got enough problems<br />with <i>my</i> old man. Come on.
1188560 1192519 - You ain't gonna hit him, are you?<br />- No, l ain't gonna hit him.
1193880 1196633 Yo, kid. When you start smokin'?
1196760 1202153 - l don't know. Didn't you ever smoke?<br />- Uh, yeah. l done a lot of bad things.
1202280 1204236 So?
1205440 1207829 So l... l wised up.
1207960 1210713 OK, so maybe l'll wise up someday too.
1212800 1217555 Maybe tonight's a good night<br />for both of us to start wisin' up.
1218520 1221034 - Don't worry about it.<br />- l gotta worry about it.
1221160 1223355 The deal was we were<br />supposed to be tight.
1223480 1226438 What about Tommy?<br />You're tight with him too, huh?
1227760 1229716 Tommy.
1233320 1235276 Yeah, well...
1236080 1238435 That was yesterday, you know?
1241760 1243910 You know, kid...
1244040 1247191 Remember you told me<br />a long time ago about deceptions?
1247320 1249675 And l was talking to you about scams?
1249800 1254078 l shoulda listened to you.<br />l was tryin' to teach you, all right?
1254200 1256998 But you were teachin' me<br />and l didn't wise up.
1257120 1261079 l didn't know and l made mistakes.<br />And l do things, you know?
1262640 1266189 lt bothers me, you know?<br />l forget a lot of things and l...
1268360 1270316 l just...
1279120 1281429 Hey, kid.
1282280 1285033 l know l made a few mistakes, you know?
1285960 1290431 But l would love to hang out<br />with you again. Just you and me.
1294280 1296316 l swear to God.
1296440 1299716 lt's just gonna be you and me this time.
1301200 1303156 Home team?
1304640 1307518 Yeah. Home team.
1310440 1314115 - Hey, kid, you wanna hear a joke?<br />- Yeah, sure. Why not?
1314240 1316708 - Knock, knock.<br />- Who's there?
1316840 1319559 - Tuna fish.<br />- Tuna fish who?
1319680 1323514 You can tune a piano,<br />but you cannot tune a fish.
1323640 1327269 - Well, you're getting better.<br />- Yeah. That's a good one.
1333200 1337830 All right, folks. Lock the door and<br />hide the kids. lt's time to wage war!

1576080 1579959 - Rocko, too much TV's bad for the eyes.<br />- My eyes are OK, Paulie.
1580080 1583038 - Well, too much TV is bad for my ears.<br />- Yeah.
1584200 1587317 - Hey, slugger. Good fight, huh?<br />- lt's OK, Dad.
1587440 1589715 You're the real champ.<br />l made this for you.
1589840 1591876 Oh, yeah?
1592000 1594355 Beautiful.
1594480 1597153 Rocko, let's put our teeth<br />around a few brews, OK?
1597280 1600636 - l could use the company.<br />- Yeah, good idea.
1601640 1605235 - Think l should go out with Paulie?<br />- lf l can watch TV.
1605360 1609672 OK, listen. You can watch TV, OK?<br />But don't stay up too late.
1609800 1613156 - You gotta get them bones growing.<br />- All right.
1614320 1617630 - What a fight! lt was somethin'.<br />- Somethin'.
1618640 1621313 l told you you could<br />give him everything but you.
1621440 1624671 - You can't give him your heart.<br />- Oh, it's OK, Adrian. Really.
1624800 1627758 - Yeah?<br />- Yeah. lt's... lt's all right.
1629440 1632398 Hey, kid. Don't you stay up too late, OK?
1633600 1635556 Some fight.
1636400 1638755 - Are you OK?<br />- Oh, sure.
1641080 1643640 - l won't be out too late.<br />- OK.
1643760 1645637 See you, champ.
1645760 1648718 - Have a good time with Uncle Paulie.<br />- Yeah.
1655080 1659471 Let me present the newest, the youngest<br />heavyweight champion of all time,
1659600 1661955 Tommy ''The Machine'' Gunn!
1663400 1666631 - Do you think it was too easy?<br />- l took some shots, but l was never hurt.
1666760 1668716 l'm just glad to be the champ.
1668840 1673834 Don't you think this looked like more like<br />a sparring session than a championship?
1673960 1676793 - lt didn't look like you broke a sweat.<br />- Very observant.
1676920 1678956 Union Cane wasn't feeling that good.
1679080 1683039 But Tommy Gunn would have done<br />the same thing if Union was 100%.
1683160 1686436 100% ?! He fought like<br />he didn't have a heartbeat!
1686560 1688676 We all know Cane is a paper champion.
1688800 1691951 - What do you mean?<br />- Cane's title was manufactured.
1692080 1695231 - He never won it from Balboa.<br />- Gentlemen, give him a break.
1695360 1698352 Tommy, will you ever get out<br />from under Rocky's shadow?
1698480 1703634 - l won the title. What more do you want?<br />- You gotta fight some real opponents.
1703760 1705796 But l beat the best tonight.
1705920 1709595 The best? This guy's a bum.<br />He doesn't even deserve a title shot.
1709720 1714635 Gentlemen, whoa! We're gettin' carried<br />away. Cane was the recognised champ.
1714760 1717433 We know the ratings system<br />can be manipulated.
1717560 1720233 Fact is, Tommy Gunn<br />beat a second-rate fighter
1720360 1723716 with so much glass in his jaw,<br />he oughta be a chandelier.
1723840 1726308 This man will prove<br />to be a great champion.
1726440 1729796 He might win a few fights,<br />but a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.
1729920 1731876 No, he's no Rocky Balboa.
1732000 1735629 Let's face it. There's only one Balboa.<br />He was the people's champion.
1735960 1739589 But in time Tommy Gunn may be<br />able to fill his shoes. Next question.
1739720 1743633 - Not by fighting stiffs like Cane, he won't.<br />- l'll fight anybody, anywhere.
1743760 1746274 When are you gonna fight a real fighter?
1746400 1750951 Gentlemen, come on. Thank you for<br />coming tonight. We look forward to...
1751080 1753036 Hey, Tommy, l got somethin' for ya.
1753160 1758598 For your next fight, try the redhead in the<br />front row. l hear she comes real cheap.
1758720 1762633 We look forward to seeing you<br />at Tommy Gunn's next fight.
1762760 1765320 Why did you say Balboa's better?<br />Do you believe that?
1765440 1768034 Of course not. Look, we can't talk in here.
1768160 1771118 Who are you gonna fight next, Tommy?
1771240 1775358 What the hell happened in there? l won<br />the damn title and they think l'm a bum!
1775480 1778870 - Why didn't you help me?<br />- When the press is right, they're right.
1779000 1783152 l'm as good as Balboa ever was and<br />l'm tired of being called a damn robot!
1783280 1786750 Listen, Tommy. You can't fight the press.<br />l can't fight them.
1786880 1791112 As long as they got Balboa on the brain,<br />he's champ. He fought wars in the ring.
1791240 1793435 Tommy, face facts. You're in his shadow.
1793560 1795790 - This is your own man talking!<br />- No, listen.
1795920 1800835 There is a way to get the respect you<br />deserve. Challenge Balboa to fight.
1800960 1804873 - George could set it up in just weeks.<br />- lt'd be the greatest fight ever.
1805000 1808037 Teacher against student,<br />old lion against young lion.
1808160 1811197 That's the only way you ever<br />gonna get peace of mind.
1811320 1815552 The press will hound you with that man's<br />legend for as long as you wear gloves.
1815680 1820310 You gotta get him into that ring, Tommy,<br />or you'll keep hearing questions like that.
1820440 1824319 You'll start to ask yourself ''Could l<br />take him? Am l really good enough?''
1824440 1826396 ''Do people think l'm a carbon copy
1826520 1831071 or a second-rate pretender who only<br />got a shot because of my skin tone?''
1831200 1833509 Got to challenge<br />that man to fight, Tommy.
1833640 1838350 lf he refuses, you gotta insult him! You<br />gotta dog him, you gotta humiliate him.
1838480 1843429 Do whatever you got to do to get him into<br />that ring! But that's what you got to do.
1847440 1851228 OK. Blast off. Rollin' silver. And down.
1851360 1853669 Andy, these flippers ain't flippin'.
1853800 1858032 - That machine cost me a fortune.<br />- lt's costin' me a fortune too.
1858160 1860435 - Rocky Balboa!<br />- What was that?
1860800 1864270 Rocky Balboa, there's a man out here<br />wishin' to speak with you.
1864400 1866834 Rocky Balboa!
1868240 1870708 Rocko, you know who that is, huh?
1870840 1872990 Yeah, l know who that is.
1874760 1880312 - Rocky, you need some help?<br />- No, guys. lt ain't no pie-eatin' contest.
1882640 1884710 Look what's in the street.
1884840 1887957 Tommy, what are you doin' here?<br />You oughta be celebratin'.
1888240 1891516 l'm challenging you to a fight.<br />Any time, any place, anywhere.
1891640 1893471 - Fight?<br />- That's right.
1893600 1897832 You're comin' here with these people<br />askin' if l wanna throw hands with you?
1897960 1901111 - ls that what this is about?<br />- Yeah. And l ain't nobody's robot.
1901240 1905677 Nobody's boy! Now are you accepting<br />the challenge or are you yellow?
1905800 1909713 He has no class. Come on, Rocko.<br />Hey, he has no class! Come on.
1919040 1922555 Hey, it ain't him. You wanna<br />shoot some eightball or somethin'?
1922680 1925592 Hey! l ain't through talkin' with you yet!
1925720 1928029 Look, l ain't got<br />no more to say to you, OK?
1928160 1932312 - l wanted good things for you.<br />- The hell you did. You're in it for money.
1932440 1935034 l'm tired of people callin' me a robot.
1935160 1938072 You thought l was in this<br />for the money, Tommy?
1938200 1940919 We were supposed to be<br />like brothers, you know?
1941040 1943395 You don't know it,<br />but you got a deception here.
1943520 1947718 This guy was usin' you for the bait.<br />He wants to get you and me in the ring.
1947840 1951071 He wants us to fight each other<br />to make the money.
1951200 1953953 He don't care about you<br />and he don't care about me neither.
1954080 1957152 Come on. Enough of the fantasy.<br />Let's talk reality.
1957280 1960716 Rocky Balboa, are you prepared<br />to accept Tommy's challenge?
1960840 1965197 - Tommy...<br />- Hey! l would have taken you any time.
1965320 1968596 - You're a piece of garbage.<br />- This ain't none of your business.
1968720 1971712 - None of my business?<br />- Come on, Paulie. Forget it.
1971840 1974957 He spit blood for you,<br />put you ahead of his own family.
1975080 1978789 And you bring these rat bums<br />around here? Kill his dignity?
1978920 1982799 Rocko made you your shot.<br />He's the real champ. You're just a joke.
1982920 1985150 Get out of here before l break your face.
1987040 1989031 Paulie?
1990080 1993516 - Don't break your hand on that bum!<br />- Paulie, are you OK?
1993640 1997235 You shoulda left him on the street,<br />where you found him.
1997960 2001839 - Merlin, get him outta here.<br />- Get off of me!
2005480 2008278 You knocked him down.<br />Why don't you knock me down?
2008400 2012393 No, in the ring. Tommy Gunn only fights<br />in the ring! Let's get outta here.
2012520 2015717 - My ring's outside.<br />- Yeah? Let's do it.
2017280 2019396 Let's go live.
2025560 2029348 - He's a punk, Rocky.<br />- He's a street fighter. You a prizefighter.
2029480 2031914 - Don't be a damn fool.<br />- You don't own me!
2032040 2034508 - You don't own me!<br />- What's wrong? Take it easy.
2034640 2037473 Nobody does! l want my respect.
2037600 2040433 Well, come and get it. Come on, Tommy.
2051120 2053839 l loved you, man! You know that?
2053960 2057589 You and me,<br />we were supposed to be like this, Tommy.
2057720 2059676 You blew it! You...
2069480 2073678 Lucky punch. But l told you<br />never to fight a street fighter fight.
2073800 2077588 - Come on, let's get out of here.<br />- You're always a champ, Rocky. Great.
2113280 2115191 Great stuff. This is beautiful.
2115760 2117990 Mom! lt's Dad.
2118120 2120350 - He's on television. He's fighting.<br />- What?!
2121480 2123596 Come on, man. Come on.
