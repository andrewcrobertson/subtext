374340 376876 I mean, I didn't understand what they was speakin' all the time,

405805 409675 Yeah, you know, absolutely. I... I think that doctors should never fight. No.
409742 411978 DUKE: That was a beautiful answer, champ. That's right.
412044 413846 Doctors should stay out of the ring.
413913 415681 Doctors should never fight.
415748 417483 They should stay out of the ring forever.
417550 420086 Rocky Balboa, the funniest champion ever.
420153 423022 America's own Rocky Balboa. How are ya? How are ya?
423089 425124 George Washington Duke here,
425191 428761 promoter extraordinaire, welcoming back Rocky Balboa,
428828 431464 champion of all the Americans and all the Russians.
431531 434333 Now, I would... I'd like to digress from the questions a bit
434400 437170 and pose an interesting proposition to the media.
437236 439972 Everyone in this city, certainly in the world of sports,
440039 442074 knows my reputation for promoting
442141 444310 some of the finest extravaganzas... I... What...
444377 446012 ...in this country.
446078 448314 Well now, with the press present,
448381 451484 I'd like to ask you, Rocky Balboa... Yeah?
451551 455922 ...to be the flamboyant, rambunctious sportsman we know you can be,
455988 458424 and give this man here, Union Cane,
458491 461961 a chance to challenge you for the heavyweight championship of the world.
462028 464764 Balboa, I want the opportunity to take what you got.
464831 467033 (REPORTERS CLAMORING)
467099 468768 Isn't this bad timing to present a challenger, Duke?
468835 470903 The man just got off the plane.
470970 473272 Timing is the essence of life, gentlemen and... And ladies.
473339 476976 Now, what I have on this paper is the largest guarantee
477043 479979 ever offered to a champion on this planet!
480046 484250 (REPORTERS CLAMORING) I'm talking about a fantastic international extravaganza,
484317 489055 to be held in Japan called "Lettin' It Go in Tokyo."
489121 491257 People, ain't it incredible that only in America
491324 493159 could people like us rise from oppression,
493226 495628 rise from poverty, to join hands
495695 497930 in this international event?
497997 499565 Only in America! Excuse... Excuse me!
500833 504136 Excuse me. My husband is retired.
504203 506839 He has nothing... He has nothing more to prove.
506906 509008 Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute!
509075 511410 Hey, Rocky, don't you consider this a public responsibility
511477 514013 to respond now rather than later?
514080 517183 Respond to the people. I mean, isn't this a question of professionalism?
517250 519385 To talk about it now, not later.
519452 521587 Mind if I heal first?
521654 523623 The whippin' you got ain't nothin' like what I got here for you.
523689 525424 So, what in the hell does this all mean?
525491 527894 No, that isn't enough. We gotta hear about this now.
527960 529829 Gotta think about that. So, anyway,
529896 532698 I wanna tell everybody that the flight over was
533399 535167 really nice.

694927 696128 Really?
698364 701200 Hmm, yeah, she looks French, sure.
701267 703169 I wouldn't show this to your mother,
703235 705971 'cause she... She don't understand French too good.
706572 707807 Oh, God.
707873 709208 Better cover that one up.
709275 712078 Well, champ, it's bedtime.

815815 817750 Good night, kid.
817817 820119 ADRIAN: (WHISPERING) You deserve the worst for what you did.
820186 822354 (PAULIE SHUSHING) Paulie, it wasn't your money. It was Rocky's money.
822421 824190 You cost us everything. You gonna be hysterical? Huh?
824256 826192 That's what I need. It was a mistake.
826258 828994 You think I thought this all was gonna happen?
829061 830763 Don't you walk away from me.
830830 833666 You just gave up our life!
833732 836335 And you think it's like some stupid thing?
836402 839004 (GROANS) Paulie! Paulie, do you know what you did?
839071 841707 Do you know the seriousness of what you did? I understand it!
841774 845077 Do you? Then answer me! I understand the whole freakin' thing! Huh?
845144 848347 I understand it! Your accountant's the crook, not me!
848414 850349 I did what I thought was right.
850416 852218 Now, don't blame me for nothin'.
852284 854286 I want to murder the bum worse than anybody.
854353 856188 Hey, Adrian, what's wrong?
856255 858090 Look what you done now.
858157 859892 She's dumpin' everything on me.
859959 861627 Oh, come on, Paulie. Don't turn this around on me.
861694 863796 Oh, come on, what'd you do, Paulie?
863863 866599 He gave power... Power of attorney to our accountant. What?
866665 869835 I just didn't gave anything to nobody, huh?
869902 872037 He sent a letter!
872104 874073 He says... He says we're gonna be in Russia a couple of months. He says,
874139 876008 "And I need Rocky to sign a tax extension!"
876075 879979 Not extension! That was a power of attorney, Paulie!
880045 883148 He's the thief! I need alcohol.
883215 885951 Rocky, on my eyes, I never stole a freakin' dime.
886952 889121 Adrian, what's happenin' here?
889188 890456 Huh? It's gone.
890522 891957 What's gone?
892024 893792 The money. The money.
893859 896328 Everything. It's all gone.
896395 898564 LAWYER: The piece of paper Paulie had you sign
898631 900766 wasn't a request for an extension on your tax returns.
900833 904937 It was a blanket power of attorney in favor of the accountant,
905004 907740 who was involved in some very high-priced commercial real estate.
907806 910209 He thought he could flip it quick, take his profit,
910276 912344 have your money back before you knew it was gone.
912411 915314 And unfortunately for you and everybody in this room,
915381 917917 his deals fell through because the market dried up.
917983 920185 And you lost millions.
920252 922621 (STUTTERING) So, what are you sayin'? There ain't nothin' I can do about it?
922688 924990 I'm doing plenty. I've filed eight criminal acts against him,
925057 927092 but you've got tremendous debt payment on this property, Rocky.
927159 928994 You didn't pay your tax returns in six years,
929061 931530 and the mortgage on your house hasn't been paid in months.
931597 933432 Wait, we didn't have a mortgage.
933499 935100 Our house was fully paid for.
935167 937036 Don't take it from me, ask him.
937102 940272 Apparently not. There's nearly $400,000 still outstanding.
940339 942374 The only thing you have that's not encumbered
942441 944243 is a gymnasium that was willed to your son
944310 947146 by a Mickey Goldmill in 1982.
947212 949782 You can sell some things. Remember those commercials you did?
949848 952418 You know, Paulie, I ain't no commercial kind of guy.
952484 954653 I'm a fighter. It's what I do for a living.
954720 957056 LAWYER: Nah, it's just as well. We couldn't get any sponsors.
957122 959458 With the investigation of the accountant,
959525 962561 out pops a criminal record of Rocky's for assault in connection with loan-sharking.
962628 965264 But that was... It was a long time ago. He didn't know what...
965331 967700 Why not a couple of more fights?
967766 969835 With your popularity right now, you could be out of this thing in no time.
969902 972338 No, he's retiring. Rocko, fighting's the ticket.
972404 974306 I said he's retired!
974373 976241 Paulie, we're here because of you!
976308 979111 Ah... I'm not takin' the heat for all this.
979178 980713 I thought I was doin' smart business.
980779 982915 You thought you did smart business?
982982 985050 Hey, you... Me?
985117 986518 What are you talking about me? The accountant was your choice!
986585 988620 My choice?
988687 990990 You should have known he was a thief, but you're never awake
991056 993158 because you live in this fairy-tale world where the air don't move.
993225 995227 Oh, Paulie... You're like a season that don't change!
995294 996829 Hey, you don't talk to her like this.
996895 998263 I'm not no tomato can you kick around!
998330 999565 Paulie, no! Yeah!
999631 1000899 You call Duke.
1000966 1002368 You tell him I'll fight Cane.
1002434 1004103 I don't care, anywhere, anytime.
1004169 1005604 No, Rocky. If that's what you want,
1005671 1007039 I'll get on it right away. No. No.
1007106 1009308 Rocky, Rocky, please.
1009375 1011744 We can't go down like this. A couple of fights, we're out of trouble, Adrian.
1011810 1013545 Yeah, but you said you wouldn't. No... I didn't say anything.
1013612 1015414 Look, did we come this far to lose it?
1015481 1017649 Well, you know, you have to see a doctor.
1017716 1019385 Adrian, I don't need to see no doctor. I need to get a promoter.
1019451 1021620 Hey, you know, you gotta see a doctor.
1021687 1023622 If he says it's all right, I'll support anything you wanna do.
1023689 1025124 I gotta fight, okay? I got problems. I gotta fight.
1025190 1026325 Will you do it for me?
1028293 1030796 All right, for you.
1030863 1034199 DOCTOR: Because of the continuous violent blows to the head,
1034266 1038537 you've developed a condition particular to boxers called cavum septum pellucidum,
1038604 1042041 which is a hole in the membrane separating the ventricles.
1042107 1045844 The brain's surface neurons in this area have also been traumatized.
1045911 1048647 Excuse me, Doctor. Simply stated, Mr. Balboa,
1048714 1051717 it means that you've suffered some damage to the brain.
1051784 1053552 ADRIAN: How long until he recovers?
1053619 1055421 The effects are irreversible.
1056221 1057556 Oh, I...
1057623 1060459 Rocky, you have to retire.
1060526 1062261 Adrian, I don't want to retire.
1062327 1063762 You know, this ain't the time to retire.
1063829 1066765 No, not in here, not in no office.
1066832 1069001 I just fought the best fight of my life.
1069068 1070702 I just did that, you know,
1072037 1074573 and all I need is a couple more.
1074640 1077009 No, Rocky, you suffered severe brain trauma.
1077076 1079411 Well, he could be wrong. Anybody could be wrong.
1079478 1082247 I don't think he is. He ain't God. Look, Adrian, only God ain't wrong.
1082314 1084817 Hey, Rocky, this is what's good for you.
1084883 1086985 All I need is a couple easy ones, right?
1087052 1088821 Not with the way it is. You can't get licensed in any state.
1088887 1091356 He can't get licensed anywhere, Doctor?
1091423 1093092 That is correct.
1093158 1095727 Rocky, do you love me?
1095794 1097796 (BREATHING HEAVILY)
1097863 1099698 Yeah, I love you. Why you ask that?
1099765 1102534 Because if you love somebody,
1102601 1104636 you live with them, you live for them.
1104703 1106738 You don't gamble with a life.
1106805 1109775 Rocky, I don't care about the money, it's you.
1110709 1112578 That's all that matters.
1114313 1116248 Please. We'll be okay.
1117216 1118650 We'll be fine.
1122488 1124490 (WHISPERING)
1125390 1126692 ADRIAN: Uh...
1128760 1131296 No one has to know, doctor, right?
1131363 1133298 It'll be strictly confidential.
1137402 1138937 Thank you.

1204369 1207873 Rocky Balboa's boxing gloves from his first heavyweight fight.
1225524 1226858 ADRIAN: Rocky?
1228493 1229861 Hey, it still fits.
1232297 1235334 Wha... Why you wearin' those clothes?
1235400 1238437 I was just goin' through some of the stuff up there, and I found 'em,
1238503 1240739 and they feel kind of comfortable, you know?
1240806 1244042 Well, I was lookin' all over for you downstairs.
1244109 1247879 It's kind of depressing. Yeah, I know what you mean.
1247946 1251183 Oh, what's this doin' in your ear?
1251250 1253218 What? Oh, God. Remember these?
1253285 1256455 Oh, I... Yeah.
1256521 1258590 Go ahead. You, uh...
1258657 1260726 I remember when you took them off. That's right.
1260792 1262794 First time I ever kissed you, remember?
1263462 1264663 Kiss me.
1266898 1270602 Adrian, I want to go out for a little bit, you know?
1270669 1272437 Just take a little walk.
1272504 1274139 Just somehow feel better, but...
1274206 1277209 Hey, could you talk to the kid? 'Cause he's...
1277276 1279711 He's really takin' this hard, you know? Sure.
1279778 1280779 Okay?
1281647 1283081 Where you goin'?
1283148 1284583 I thought I'd go to Andy's.
1295227 1297095 (BAR CROWD CHATTERING)
1329428 1331363 How you doin', Mick?
1402000 1405337 (ROCKY GRUNTING) Slip the jab.
1405404 1409107 Slip the jab. Slip the jab. MICKEY: Slip the jab, will ya?
1409174 1411476 (ROCKY GRUNTING) MICKEY: Slip the jab!
1413879 1416515 That's right. That's it.
1416581 1419184 Hey, I didn't hear no bell! Okay.
1419251 1421486 All right. That's right.
1421553 1423522 Slip the jab.
1423588 1425457 That's it. Mentalize.
1425524 1427759 See that bum in front of you.
1427826 1431596 You see yourself doin' right, and you do right.
1431663 1434499 That's pretty. That's very pretty.
1434566 1436435 Time!
1436501 1439638 Oh, come here, Rock. My God, you're ready, ain't you?
1439704 1441306 And Apollo won't know what hit him.
1441373 1443842 You're gonna roll over him like a bulldozer,
1443909 1446378 an Italian bulldozer.
1446445 1450248 You know, kid, I know how you feel about this fight that's comin' up.
1450315 1453852 (CHUCKLING) Because I was young once, too.
1453919 1455187 And I tell you somethin'.
1456688 1458990 Well, if you wasn't here,
1459057 1462561 I probably wouldn't be alive today.
1462627 1464729 The fact that you're here
1464796 1467632 and doin' as well as you're doin' gives me,
1467699 1471803 what do you call it, a motivization, huh, to stay alive?
1471870 1476641 'Cause I think that people die sometimes when they don't wanna live no more.
1476708 1478977 Nature's smarter than people think.
1479044 1481313 And nature is smarter than people think.
1481379 1484583 Little by little, we lose our friends, we lose everything.
1484649 1488653 We keep losing and losing till we say,
1488720 1492991 you know, "What the hell am I livin' around here for? I got no reason to go on."
1494392 1496962 But with you, kid,
1497028 1499598 boy, I got a reason to go on,
1499664 1501533 and I'm gonna stay alive,
1501600 1504102 and I will watch you make good.
1504169 1506738 And I'll never leave you. And I'll never leave you
1506805 1508840 until that happens.
1508907 1513545 'Cause when I leave you, you'll not only know how to fight,
1513612 1516781 you'll be able to take care of yourself outside the ring, too.
1516848 1518350 Is that okay?
1518416 1519551 ROCKY: It's okay.
1520452 1522287 MICKEY: Okay.
1522354 1524456 Now, I got a little gift for you.
1524523 1525790 Oh, Mick, you... Now, wait a minute. Wait a minute now.
1525857 1527325 Wait a minute.
1527392 1528560 Really, I don't need nothin'.
1528627 1530395 Look at this. See that?
1530462 1532898 This is the favorite thing that I have on this Earth,
1534199 1537636 and Rocky Marciano give me that.
1537702 1540005 You know what it was? His cuff link.
1540071 1541439 Huh?
1541506 1543608 And now I'm givin' it to you.
1544776 1548046 And it is gonna be like a...
1548113 1551116 Like an angel on your shoulder, see?
1551182 1552350 (COUGHS)
1552417 1554119 If you ever get hurt,
1554185 1557155 and you feel that you're goin' down,
1557222 1560358 this little angel is gonna whisper in your ear.
1560425 1561860 He's gonna say,
1561927 1564329 "Get up, you son of a bitch,
1565697 1567265 "'cause Mickey loves you."
1568266 1569200 Okay?
1570802 1571903 Thanks, Mick. All right.
1571970 1574272 I love you, too.
1575307 1576341 Go after 'em, kid.
1577609 1579244 Go after 'em. Thanks.
1583982 1585250 You was the angel.
1586751 1588219 There it is.
1588286 1590021 What happened to his other cuff link?
1590088 1592157 I don't know. He only give me one.
1593024 1594826 He gave it to some bum.

1719384 1721219 You ought to try it sometime.

1760725 1762360 Watch out for the scammers. Everybody's gonna try to scam.
1762427 1764262 What's a scam? Ask your father.

1776374 1778676 Yeah, he had a nice head. Welcome back.

1783782 1786017 Excuse me? You're saying beware of deceptions.

1809874 1812143 I don't know. Anyway, we're gonna be late for school. Come on.

1819250 1821419 Relax, would you?
1821486 1823054 So, anyway, you know, everybody's got an angle, you know?
1823121 1824923 Yo, tough break, Rock. Yeah.
1824989 1827125 Everybody's got a hustle, you know?
1827192 1829794 See, like these kids around here, they got street brains, you see?
1829861 1832597 That's how they live. These kids ain't like... Listen to me.
1832664 1835433 They ain't like no personalities that you growed up with.
1835500 1837936 So you gotta stay very, very sharp around here.
1838002 1839938 I intend to.
1840004 1843875 "Intend." You know, sometimes you make me feel very stupid.
1843942 1847812 Why? Why? 'Cause you're smarter than me, and that's a fact.
1847879 1849547 No, I'm not. Yeah, you are.
1849614 1851516 It's like every day you learn something new,
1851583 1853651 and every day I forget something new,
1853718 1855687 but listen. Listen to me.
1855753 1857856 We're in this thing together, so if you can figure out any way
1857922 1860625 on how to fix things up, don't be afraid to tell me,
1860692 1863595 'cause we gotta stick together, 'cause what are we?
1863661 1864596 What?
1865463 1866464 What are we?
1867298 1869033 Oh. Oh, home team.
1869100 1871336 Home team! You know, you got that right.
1871402 1873938 You know, I used to go to this school when I was a kid. You know. Nice bricks.
1874005 1876741 Used to have good milk at lunch and everything. It was real tough then,
1876808 1879677 but I think you can handle it, don't you think?
1879744 1882513 KID: No way, you don't even know what you're talking about.
1882580 1884482 If you went here, I can go here.
1885350 1886918 I'm not scared, really.
1888052 1890088 Really?
1890154 1892590 Well, I guess I'm a little scared.
1892657 1894492 But that's normal, don't you think?
1894559 1896427 Oh, yeah. You know, I had 72 fights comin' up,
1896494 1898363 and every one of 'em I was scared.
1898429 1901399 So, yeah, you know, that's real, real normal.
1904535 1906704 I'll see ya later. Okay, kid.
1906771 1908172 Here's the front door.
1909507 1911442 Okay. Hey, wait! Whoa, what's this?
1911509 1912510 What's...
1913745 1916214 Goodness gracious. Where'd this come from?
1916281 1919550 It's a strange place to stash your lunch money, don't you think?
1919617 1921819 Ah, it's just a lunch joke, you know?
1921886 1925657 Thanks, Dad. Okay, listen. I'll see you later.
1925723 1928559 Remember, Daddy loves you. You're number one.
1928626 1932697 Home team! Just be nice, right? You'll be okay.
1932764 1935633 And don't mess with nobody's girlfriend.
1935700 1937235 They don't like that around here.
1944142 1946477 ROCKY: You know, Paulie, I'm really worried about the kid.
1946544 1948212 You know, he ain't used to living like this.
1948279 1950415 He don't know the streets or nothing.
1950481 1952717 And that school, I know exactly what's gonna happen.
1952784 1955687 Some wise guy's gonna come up to him 'cause he's my kid.
1955753 1957855 He's just gonna come out and try to bang him out,
1957922 1960825 give him a cheap shot, you know? I mean... Jeez.
1960892 1962393 Mr. Balboa? Yeah?
1962460 1963828 How you doin'? My name's Tommy Gunn.
1963895 1965596 Yeah, how you doin'?
1965663 1967265 Well, with a name like that, you better be tough.
1967332 1968900 Yeah, very true. It ain't easy.
1968967 1970735 Anyway, I come from Oklahoma.
1970802 1972870 Welcome. I have an amateur's record of 45-to-one.
1972937 1974639 Uh-huh. And I turned pro at 18, and I had eight fights.
1974706 1977008 You're a fighter? Yeah, I'm a fighter.
1977075 1979010 Got it. And now that I'm 20, I'd just like to show you what I got.
1979077 1980945 Well, I... I mean, I've saved up about 400 bucks.
1981012 1982246 Mr. Rocky Balboa. I could pay you for training.
1982313 1984182 Yeah... What?
1984248 1985917 Excuse me, young man, I have some business here.
1985984 1988219 What, is he lost or what? Huh? Thank you.
1988286 1990555 Good to see you, again, friend. How you doin'? Yeah. How you doin'?
1990621 1992623 DUKE: My health is fine. What more could a man ask for?
1992690 1994525 PAULIE: Money and hair. Listen, I gotta go to work now.
1994592 1996094 What? Where? Here? In a sweat box? Yeah.
1996160 1997628 Can't be good for the image.
1997695 1999397 Urban light. What are you gonna do?
1999464 2001265 Hey, Rocky, Rocky... What'd you say?
2001332 2003668 Urban light. It's "blight." Urban blight.
2003735 2005169 Rock, George would like you to consider putting on those damn gloves again.
2005236 2006804 It's a hell of a payday.
2006871 2008439 Well, you know, I'm officially expired.
2008506 2010375 No, you do have marquis value.
2010441 2012110 You put butts in the buckets, asses in the seats.
2012176 2013978 A businessman with any sort of brain
2014045 2016214 don't retire when he can still pull in the bread, baby.
2016280 2018516 'Cause only in America do we get these kind of opportunities.
2018583 2020351 Union Cane's goin' for the title on the 14th. Uh-huh.
2020418 2022720 Yeah, here's some tickets. Be our guests.
2022787 2024922 We have a strong feeling about this one. Think he's gonna take it.
2024989 2027091 That's the time to challenge. Because people love comebacks,
2027158 2029727 and there's nothin' in the boxing business more commercial
2029794 2032730 than a long-shot comeback of a down-on-his-luck, pure snow-white underdog.
2032797 2034665 Now, like your Mark Twain once said,
2034732 2037135 "Virtue has never been as respectable as money."
2037201 2038836 Who's Twain? He was a painter.
2038903 2041606 Look, simply put, you're the great white hope.
2041672 2043775 You mean great white dope. No, forget it. No, no, Rock, Rock...
2043841 2046711 I ain't emotionally... Hey, hold it. Hold the bullshit.
2046778 2048513 I know what the problem is. You think I was born yesterday?
2048579 2050481 Merlin, show him the paper.
2050548 2052350 Now, this is your medical report.
2052417 2054585 It's not so good, but we can work around it.
2054652 2056621 Where'd you get this? It really doesn't matter, does it, Rock?
2056687 2058656 You agree to fight Cane, and George here can guarantee
2058723 2060224 you get licensed in any country around the world.
2060291 2062226 Guaranteed. You can do this?
2062293 2064695 No problem. His comeback's in the bag and worth millions.
2064762 2067165 The time is hot, the deal is hot. Caliente!
2067231 2068733 We could use one more payday. I agree!
2068800 2070668 Adrian, where'd you come from?
2070735 2072603 I didn't think you were going to... Oh...
2072670 2074338 Mrs. Balboa just appeared. This woman is magic.
2074405 2076574 Look, I don't think you're very funny.
2076641 2078309 Are you trying to talk my husband into fighting again?
2078376 2079677 We're talkin' business, now, darlin'.
2079744 2081946 Do you like feelin' hard up?
2082013 2083614 Do you like reachin' in your pocket and only feelin' your leg?
2083681 2086117 Well, do you? I didn't think so.
2086184 2089487 I'm offering you your last golden opportunity to dump this loser image.
2089554 2091389 Who you talkin' to?
2091456 2093758 Hey, Adrian, you weren't workin' across...
2093825 2095493 Hey, whoa, what the hell are you two people talkin' about? Huh?
2095560 2097028 This is a tremendous opportunity.
2097095 2098729 Opportunity for who?
2098796 2100998 For you to make money? For him to be disabled?
2101065 2102767 What would you do if the choices were reversed?
2104001 2106337 You have to think about that.
2106404 2109607 Rocky, they don't care about you.
2109674 2111976 You want to get serious? Let's get serious.
2112043 2114612 You represent the dreams of the long shots, the little people.
2114679 2118182 The never-wills identify with you, and identification is the key to public success.
2118249 2121285 You're a true champion, a true product of the people. Now sell it.
2121352 2123421 Sell it while there are still buyers.
2123488 2125456 They ain't gonna last forever. You say you're a fighter? Then fight!
2125523 2127625 You say you want a champion's do, then do it
2127692 2129794 and I'll make you so much money you could swim in it!
2129861 2131696 You can swim, can't you, darlin'?
2131762 2133698 What do you say? Come on. Put it there.
2133764 2135366 It's time to put some hustle behind this muscle.
2135433 2138202 He's done! He's done fighting!
2145309 2147578 You're a damn fool.
2149113 2152016 Maybe we ought to sign Mrs. Balboa to fight Cane, huh?
2152083 2154652 Looks like she's the one with the cojones in the family.
2157722 2160691 Yo, you don't talk like that in front of my wife, you know?
2160758 2162860 That ain't no park bench, boy.
2166964 2168766 I'll get him.
2168833 2170801 (STUTTERING) Rocky, I'm really sorry. I didn't wanna...
2170868 2173971 Hey, you guys want privacy now? I'll be upstairs.
2178109 2179243 Rocky...
2180478 2182747 Rocky, I'm sorry. I... I...
2182813 2185016 But, you know, it just takes one bad hit,
2185082 2186717 and you could be an invalid.
2186784 2188352 Well, I feel like an invalid already, Adrian.
2188419 2190354 Why'd you gotta come back here?
2190421 2192657 You're too smart for this place here. I got nothin' to do.
2192723 2194725 Gloria. I called Gloria.
2194792 2197528 She said, you know, she could use some part-time help.
2197595 2199730 Yeah, but why do you wanna do this, Adrian?
2199797 2201566 Why do you wanna go back to the same place you started from?
2201632 2203467 I gotta do it, but you don't gotta do it!
2203534 2206804 I wanted to be there so I could be close to you.
2216247 2218115 All right. Yeah.
2218182 2220184 You know, it's gettin' a little cold out here. Maybe...
2220251 2223087 Okay. Maybe you better get inside, okay? I understand.
2223154 2224889 Are you all right? What?
2224956 2227558 Are you all right? Yeah, I'm all right. I'm fine.
2227625 2229393 Hey, it's gettin' cold, okay?
2235600 2237802 Yo, Adrian!
2237868 2239904 Did we ever leave this place?
2239971 2242273 (TRAIN CLATTERING)
2242340 2243874 I don't know!
2249647 2252316 Hey, mind if I talk to you now?
2252383 2254685 My head's a little busy right now.
2266664 2268566 George, I don't know if you're gonna get him.
2268633 2270801 This guy, Balboa, he don't think straight anymore.
2270868 2272570 None of these bums think straight, but all I need is an angle.
2272637 2274205 I'll fight Balboa right now. Hey...
2274272 2275273 I'm better than Balboa ever was.
2275339 2276674 Hey, hey!
2277842 2279543 I own the paper on you, boy.
2279610 2281579 You will fight who I tell you,
2281646 2284081 where I tell you, and how I tell you, you got that?
2285549 2287518 Don't aggravate the hand that feeds you, huh?
2288219 2289353 All right?
2291856 2293891 None of these bums think straight.
2298562 2300298 All I need is a hook.
2300364 2302333 (CHATTERING)
2311709 2314679 Hey, ain't you Rocky's kid?
2314745 2317148 Yeah, you're Rocky's kid. You're Rocky's kid, right?
2317214 2319884 Yeah, how you doin'? Yeah, I seen your picture in the paper.
2319950 2322887 And you know what? Your old man's a punk. What?
2322953 2324588 (ALL SHOUTING)
2324655 2326490 Get off me!
2326557 2328526 And what are you wearin' my coat for, huh?
2328592 2330695 ... all right? Just leave him alone! Yeah? What a big joke!
2330761 2333064 Give me my coat! I'm not kiddin' around anymore!
2333130 2334598 GIRL: You better let him have it. No way!
2334665 2335900 (GROANS)
2341472 2343674 BOY: Don't get sick now!
2343741 2346143 Hope you don't catch cold, rich boy!
2349547 2353050 Keep it high. Slippin' and slidin'. With... That's it. Come on.
2353117 2355052 That don't interest you? This cup?
2355119 2357054 Rocky drinks out of it around the house. Ten bucks.
2357121 2358589 Well, hey, man. How I know it's the real thing?
2358656 2360257 Look at the lip marks, huh?
2360324 2362259 All right, five bucks. Five bucks. No more.
2362326 2364562 You got a deal. Okay.
2364628 2366764 Excuse me. Tommy Gunn!
2366831 2368366 Is there someplace I can change?
2368432 2370234 In there. Give me the money.
2370301 2372603 Time! Hey, Richard, Richard, good friend, listen to me.
2372670 2375339 If you wanna survive, you gotta learn to slip the jab, you know?
2375406 2378442 Keep it high, and hit and not get hit, you know?
2378509 2379677 Okay, take off.
2379744 2381078 Rocko? Yeah?
2381145 2383247 Remember Tommy Gunn?
2383314 2385383 Oh, yeah, yeah. He says he wants to fight. I told him to get married.
2385449 2386917 Why?
2386984 2388853 That's gym humor, Rocko.
2388919 2391088 Oh, that... Oh. Okay.

2401298 2402533 what's a cojones?
2403567 2405369 Cojones?
2405436 2408305 Cojones? Cojones is Latin for Spanish nuts.
2408372 2409740 TRAINER: Yo, Rock.
2409807 2411475 We're ready. ROCKY: Wonderful.
2412943 2415646 Hey, uh, kid, you got the headgear?
2415713 2417748 Nah, I don't need one. Nah.
2419383 2422153 He's gonna get his cojones knocked out.
2422219 2426157 Okay. Ready, guy? Benson, go easy, all right?
2426223 2429160 BENSON: Sure. Okay, Rock. Time.
2429226 2431729 (GRUNTING) All right. Just go easy now.
2431796 2433464 Slip the jab now.
2433531 2435366 (BOTH GROAN)
2435433 2437635 TRAINER: Go easy. Hey, kid. What's his name again?
2437701 2439136 Tommy Gunn. Tommy Gunn.
2439203 2442373 Tommy. Whoa! It ain't no law to duck.
2442440 2444708 TRAINER: That's it. Ow. Go side to side. That's it.
2445276 2446644 Whoa!
2446710 2448145 (ROCKY SHOUTING)
2448212 2450114 Hey, man! Take it easy, man!
2450181 2451882 Hey, come on, you guys, lighten up.
2451949 2453451 It's called sparring. Now, go on easy.
2453517 2455219 ROCKY: Whoa! Hey, hey!
2455286 2456854 Okay, okay.
2456921 2459023 Hey, lighten up! That's it. Tie him up.
2459089 2460958 That's it. You smell that, Rocko?
2461025 2462460 What's that? That's the odor of opportunity.
2462526 2463961 TRAINER: Hey, that's it.
2464028 2465663 What'd I tell you? Hey, hey! Time!
2465729 2467398 Hey, that's it! Time!

2473771 2475539 Tommy, are you crazy or somethin', huh?
2475606 2477141 Hey, what's the matter with you, man?
2477208 2479543 TRAINER: Get out of the ring. I'm sorry.
2479610 2481412 Get out of the ring. Cool off, kid. All right. I'm sorry about this.
2481479 2483013 He stinks of opportunity, Rocko.
2483080 2484648 Hey, look.
2484715 2486851 Goin' easy don't mean breakin' bones, kid.
2486917 2488919 Man, I'm sorry. But what do you think?
2488986 2491055 What do I think? I don't think you listen too good.
2491121 2494091 But you fight, you brawl like you was a street fighter,
2494158 2496293 and I know somethin' about that.
2496360 2498028 But this is called boxing. This ain't no mugging, you know?
2498095 2499964 I'm sorry. But I know I can do it all.
2500030 2502199 Yeah? Well, not on this date, okay?
2503167 2504802 That's it?
2504869 2506604 Hey, yo, I gotta work with these kids here.
2506670 2508105 You guys get ready. We're going one more.
2508172 2510274 How about you try to manage me?
2510341 2512977 Manage? Yeah, unless you think I ain't got nothin' goin'.
2514044 2516213 You ain't got nothin' goin'.
2516280 2518415 Yeah, all right, you got a lot goin'. You got a lot of tools.
2518482 2521418 But I ain't no manager. I ain't never been man...
2521485 2524355 You know, the gentleman that owned this place, that was a manager.
2524421 2528893 But, me, I was always the managed... Guy.
2528959 2531295 Hey, look. Good luck, all right?
2534064 2535332 All right, guys. Let's go.
2536734 2537935 Come on, move around.
2539904 2541839 (SIGHS) That's it. Nice.
2546510 2548012 (GRUNTS)
2554552 2556153 All right, you guys, come on.
2556220 2558188 No cheap shots. Move it around.
2565563 2566797 How you doin'?
2567798 2571402 Cold? You look cold.
2571468 2574071 I guess it has somethin' to do with the weather.
2575673 2577207 Here, take my coat.
2577875 2579677 No, thanks.
2579743 2581011 Where's your boyfriend?
2581078 2582479 (SCOFFS)
2582546 2584782 Him. Forget it. He ain't got no manners.
2586650 2588986 I'm Jewel, if you wanna know.
2590788 2592222 I'm Robert.
2592790 2595826 Hi.
2595893 2598295 Well, I been livin' here about six years now.
2598362 2599530 (LAUGHS)
2599597 2601231 It ain't Disneyland.
2601298 2604134 You been to Disneyland? Sure.
2604201 2607237 You make it sound like everybody has.
2607304 2609306 I know you can't tell by the way I look,
2609373 2612910 but I ain't like the other kids around here.
2612977 2615479 Why? I mean, what makes you so different?
2615546 2617881 I don't know. I guess it's 'cause I wanna get out.
2617948 2619750 You know how it is.
2621251 2624755 Hmm, you know, for an Italian kid,
2624822 2626390 you ain't got a bad butt.
2627858 2629426 BOY: Shut up, man. Let's go. Come on.
2635399 2637768 PAULIE: First money I get, I'm goin' to Miami.
2637835 2639036 Why Miami?
2639103 2641071 Miami needs new gigolos.
2641138 2643607 Yeah, I read somethin' like that.
2643674 2644808 Ow.
2646443 2648012 My back is gettin' bad.
2648078 2649880 How come you don't have arthritis?
2649947 2651382 Yo, ain't I got enough?
2651448 2653050 MAN: Hey, watch where you're going.
2653117 2655786 Adrian's too good for this.
2655853 2658522 This place is really depressing, Paulie, you know? It's...
2658589 2660391 Yo, Rock, come inside.
2660457 2662559 Everybody's been askin' for you. You too, Paulie.
2662626 2664962 Hey, no, thanks. I'm a little beat. I'm a little thirsty.
2665029 2666730 Hey, you go if you want to, Paulie.
2666797 2668999 Mr. Balboa? Look at this. Tommy Gunn.
2669066 2671035 Yo, why you still hangin' around, kid?
2671101 2672736 Is there somethin' I can do for you?
2672803 2675472 Yeah. I'd like to try again.
2675539 2677641 Hey, kid, you know, I'd like to help you out,
2677708 2680010 but I really don't know nothin' about no managing.
2680077 2682046 All I'm askin' for is a chance.
2682112 2684114 Man, if I screw up or do somethin' you don't like,
2684181 2685616 man, you don't have to throw me out. Hell, I'll leave.
2685683 2687251 What have you got to lose?
2687317 2689286 Me? Nothin'. I ain't got nothin' to lose.
2689353 2690754 It's what you got to lose. And I got nothin' to lose.
2690821 2692823 Maybe you do. Like, look,
2692890 2695225 what if I don't do good, right? You know, and you don't make it?
2695292 2698462 I don't want you blamin' me for this, kid, you know?
2698529 2701231 You know, here's what I would do if I was you. No, listen to me.
2701298 2703333 If I was you, here's what I would do.
2703400 2705803 I would go home, and I'd talk to your family people.
2705869 2708005 Maybe you could come up with somethin' better, you know?
2708072 2709740 I got no family people.
2709807 2711475 Man, all I got is what you see here.
2711542 2713811 Man, I know everything about you
2713877 2716080 from back when... When you had your first fight with Apollo Creed.
2716146 2717781 Yeah. I mean, I read how nobody cared about you,
2717848 2719750 how no one ever gave you a chance.
2719817 2721385 And I realize I don't come from the same streets as you do,
2721452 2723754 but I'm hungry like you were.
2723821 2726156 And ever since I put on gloves, I've been waitin' to meet you,
2726223 2728025 'cause I knew that if anybody could make me a winner, it was you.
2729059 2731061 Winner. Hey, Paulie,
2731128 2732629 you see a winner standin' here?
2732696 2734298 Yes! Man, you beat the best!
2734364 2735999 Nobody could ever say any different.
2736066 2738035 Look, Rock, you don't know me,
2738102 2740237 but anything you want me to do, I'll do.
2740304 2742873 And if I can't, I'll bust my butt trying.
2742940 2744541 Man, I'm not hustlin' you, man.
2744608 2746477 All I'm askin' for is a chance. Mmm.
2746543 2748011 Man, just one shot.
2758922 2760524 Are you hungry?
2762526 2763460 Yeah.
2764228 2765229 Yeah?
2765863 2767798 Come on.
2767865 2770167 You're really gonna like the way Adrian cooks, you know.
2770234 2774138 She does, like, amazing things with macaroni, especially tomatoes.
2774204 2776073 But I gotta warn you.
2776140 2777875 She can be a little vicious with the garlic.
2777941 2780344 (CHUCKLES)
2780410 2783080 So, why'd this kid smack your face for, huh?
2783147 2785249 It really doesn't matter, Dad. Sorry...
2785315 2787217 Hell, sure, it matters. It does matter. They took his coat.
2787284 2788952 No. They... Look, I don't want the coat.
2789019 2790888 They took the one with the collar?
2790954 2793257 ADRIAN: I'm gonna go to your school tomorrow and just...
2793323 2794925 Yeah, you should. You'll only make things worse if you go.
2794992 2796560 Can't I do what I think is right?
2796627 2798428 Well, you know, what do you think is right?
2798495 2800264 A baseball bat across the face would be nice.
2800330 2802299 Paulie, what are you tellin' this kid?
2802366 2804401 Adrian, can I have the plate? I'm sorry, yes, Rocky.
2804468 2806470 You know, I had trouble one time when I was in school.
2806537 2808338 It seemed like every day I got chased by this one kid,
2808405 2810140 till one day my mother said to me, she said,
2810207 2811375 "Just pretend the guy's like a balloon."
2811441 2813243 Balloon?
2813310 2815012 She said if you pop him hard, these guys just go away.
2815078 2816847 (TOMMY CHUCKLING)
2818048 2820551 Tommy, we're trying to raise our son
2820617 2822853 so he can handle his problems with his mind,
2822920 2824688 not his muscles.
2824755 2827057 Sorry. That's why I'm gonna get mangled.
2827124 2829126 No, you ain't gonna get mangled.
2829193 2830894 Dad, will you teach me how to fight?
2830961 2832863 PAULIE: A baseball bat would be nice.
2832930 2835632 Come on. Do you want to grow up and just use your fists?
2835699 2838202 You know, Adrian, I don't think it would be so bad
2838268 2841104 if I taught him how to throw a few
2841171 2842940 deadly punches, you know.
2843006 2844641 Tommy, did your Dad teach you how to fight?
2844708 2847344 Uh, no, not exactly. I had to... What?
2847411 2849680 Come on, sweetheart, don't get personal. No, it's okay.
2849746 2853050 See, my old man, he used to drink a lot, seriously.
2853116 2855252 He'd go out with his friends and tie one on,
2855319 2857120 then he'd come home and look to punch on me.
2857187 2859122 You know, he'd punch on my mother, too.
2859189 2861558 He did that a lot of times.
2861625 2863193 You know, so, growing up, I never really thought about fighting anybody
2863260 2865162 but my father.
2865229 2867831 You know, when I was 13, I got in trouble at school.
2867898 2871268 He tied me down and he whipped me so bad I couldn't walk for a week.
2871335 2872903 Just couldn't do anything.
2872970 2875005 (CLEARS THROAT)
2875072 2877341 But, I tell you, the first guy I ever knocked out was my father.
2877407 2880777 And now when I get in the ring, it's like all I see is him.
2880844 2883714 That's kind of sick, huh?
2883780 2887317 Hey, yo, Tommy. At least you had an old man to knock out, you know.
2889853 2890988 Yeah.
2892356 2894324 Some of us didn't even have that, you know?
2894391 2896593 Yeah, someday you could punch out your pop.
2896660 2899263 Hey, yo, Paulie, what are you tellin' the kid things like this?
2899329 2901231 Hey, it's fittest of the survival.
2902065 2903667 Hey, Tommy,
2903734 2905535 where you stayin' tonight? You got a place?
2905602 2907838 Oh, uh, I'll find someplace to stay. I mean...
2907905 2910607 No, I tell you, we got room down in the basement.
2910674 2912976 It's not... It's nice, I don't know.
2913043 2915245 What about me? Wait, now, sweetheart. Your son is sleeping down there.
2915312 2917881 No, well, he can stay with his uncle, right?
2917948 2919816 What the hell am I? A pit stop?
2919883 2921585 ROCKY: No... Hey, I don't want to cause any problems.
2921652 2923353 I mean, I can find someplace to stay.
2923420 2925055 No, it's okay. You know, it's just
2925122 2927557 for a little while, you know, right?
2927624 2929860 No problem at all. You know, it'll be all right.
2929927 2931862 Hey, kid, I appreciate it. Is that all right? It's cold outside.
2931929 2933263 Hey, I'm not changin' no sheets.
2933330 2936533 Hey, since when have you ever?
2936600 2938268 Hey, Tommy, why don't you come on down
2938335 2940437 and we'll show you the whole place?
2940504 2942506 Sweetheart, why don't you go downstairs,
2942572 2944741 show your Father what you did today? Come on. Come on.
2949346 2951648 Hey, junior, your plumbin' don't leak, do it?
2954751 2956153 (CHUCKLES)
2956219 2957754 (SIGHS)
2959556 2962259 You know this guy? Yeah. He hits hard.
2964861 2966964 TOMMY: You know, Adrian, man, she can really cook.
2967030 2969266 ROCKY: Yeah, she's okay.
2969333 2972602 Listen, Tommy, we ain't had a chance to get this place too nice, so...
2972669 2975672 I'll get it together in a little while, you know. Oh!
2975739 2978675 Wow, man! This is what it's all about!
2978742 2981745 Holy mackerel... Well, I... Why do you keep this stuff down here?
2981812 2984214 When did you get a chance to do this?
2984281 2986583 He took everything out of a box and fixed this up like this. It's beautiful!
2986650 2990053 And you painted! When'd you get a chance to do this, kid?
2990120 2991989 After school. It's no big deal.
2992055 2993924 If you don't mind me asking, where'd you get the glove?
2993991 2995625 Oh, this? Yeah.
2995692 2997828 Oh, thanks. This is one of my favorite objects.
2997894 2999830 You know, like, Mickey give me this before he departed.
2999896 3002566 It was Rocky Marciano's cuff link that we had fixed.
3002632 3004668 Really? The real Rocky Marciano? Yeah.
3004735 3006503 Yeah. You know, you got me thinkin' about Mick.
3006570 3008372 I wanna show you somethin'. Come on.
3008438 3011775 He told me a long time ago. He says that, uh,
3013110 3015612 fightin' is like, 90% in the skull
3015679 3018115 and 10% in the body. This is what he says to me.
3018181 3021318 Hey, Dad, I met this really nice girl today. She's great.
3021385 3023120 Oh, yeah? Really? That's wonderful.
3023186 3025355 Yeah, she's a lot better than Sarah.
3025422 3027824 (STUTTERING) Hey, don't change the station. I'll be right back with you.
3027891 3030694 I just wanna tell Tommy a few things, you know? Hey.
3030761 3033697 Who was your best friend back in Orlando?
3033764 3036066 Uh, that's... That's Oklahoma.
3036133 3038168 Right, well, yeah. Uh, Eric Elder.
3038235 3042339 No, no, no. No, your best friend is a guy named Frankie Fear.
3042406 3044941 You see, fear is a fighter's best friend.
3045008 3047177 You know, but it ain't nothin' to be ashamed of.
3047244 3048912 See, fear keeps you sharp,
3048979 3050914 it keeps you awake,
3050981 3053150 you know, it makes you want to survive. You know what I mean?
3053216 3055752 But the thing is, you gotta learn how to control it. All right?
3055819 3057521 'Cause fear is like this fire, all right?
3057587 3059556 And it's burnin' deep inside.
3059623 3061525 Now, if you control it, Tommy,
3061591 3063560 it's gonna make you hot.
3063627 3065395 But, you see, if this thing here, it controls you,
3065462 3067097 it's gonna burn you
3067164 3068331 and everything else around you up.
3068398 3070000 That's right, you know?
3070067 3071668 (CHUCKLING) Anyway,
3071735 3073503 these are the things that was taught to me,
3073570 3076807 and if you want, I'd like to teach to you.
3076873 3079709 So, this, uh... This mean you're gonna manage me?
3079776 3083080 Absolutely. Hey, home team! Okay! All right!
3083146 3085115 Let's go for it. Yeah! Hey, Rock,
3085182 3087050 as long as we're down here, do you mind showin' me a few things?
3087117 3089219 Sure, Tommy. I'm gonna show you a lot of things.
3090821 3092322 (KIDS CHATTERING)
3094324 3097394 Hey, rich boy, how much you got in your pocket today?
3097461 3099229 Nothin'. Come on, let's have it.
3099296 3100897 Nothin'. I got nothin'.
3100964 3103500 Come on. Give me the money. Come on!
3103567 3105368 Hey, I gotta eat.
3105435 3108271 He's hungry. He's gotta eat. Well, eat this!
3111174 3113376 (GROANING) I got it. I got it. Go.
3113443 3116413 Father Carmine! Yo!
3117180 3119149 Father Carmine!
3119216 3121318 You know, maybe he's not home. No, priests is always home.
3121384 3123987 Oh, Rocky! Yo!
3124054 3126656 (SPEAKING ITALIAN)
3126723 3129292 Oh, well, I didn't want to disturb you that much, Father.
3129359 3130460 FATHER: No disturb.
3130527 3132496 (SPEAKING ITALIAN)
3132562 3134931 Oh, excellent. Everything is perfect. You know...
3134998 3137334 Father, this is my new friend, Tommy Gunn.
3137400 3139803 (SPEAKING ITALIAN)
3142272 3144708 Well, I was wondering... You know, Tommy here is a fighter,
3144774 3146576 and I'm supposed to be his manager, you know?
3146643 3148478 So I was wondering if you could do me a favor,
3148545 3150614 you know, if you ain't that busy.
3150680 3152482 If you could throw us down a couple blessings, you know?
3152549 3154718 One, that I don't mess up bein' a manager,
3154784 3157487 and B, that Tommy does as good as I think he can do.
3157554 3160824 You know, great, and don't get hurt none. Could you do that?
3160891 3164227 (SPEAKS ITALIAN)
3168999 3170667 I love when he does that.
3170734 3172869 Hey, thanks, Father. I really appreciate this.
3172936 3173970 (SPEAKS ITALIAN)
3174037 3175472 Anytime.
3175539 3176907 Okay. Hey, I'll see you in church!
3176973 3179476 (SPEAKS ITALIAN)
3179543 3181144 (CHUCKLING) Okay.
3181211 3183146 Hey, man, what'd you do this for?
3183213 3184581 Hey, it don't hurt havin' an angel in your corner, you know?
3184648 3185782 (LAUGHS) Come on!
3189553 3191421 Hey, Rock, how's it goin'?
3191488 3193190 Doin' great, guys!

3915778 3918748 And those top contenders, Tommy boy, I do surely own.
3918814 3920316 I got the contracts.
3921317 3923819 It's a complex business.
3923886 3926522 But if you want the best, then go with the best.
3926589 3928324 Man, what about Rocky? I mean...
3928391 3930026 Rocky can still train you.
3930092 3931527 My God, he's done a wonderful job.
3931594 3933629 Now look here, here's $20,000.
3934697 3935665 Take it as an advance.
3937800 3940002 Time to put some hustle behind this muscle.
3940069 3941103 Merry Christmas.
3941170 3942238 (DUKE CHUCKLES)
3942305 3944073 Merry Christmas.
3945341 3947410 ROCKY: Whoa, stop the presses!
3947476 3950012 Yo, Adrian, I can't believe who just come up on the roof.
3950079 3953082 You know, hey, you know, he just landed there and crashed.
3953149 3954517 And who do you think it is?
3954583 3956285 Do I hear reindeer on my roof?
3957219 3958788 You know...
3958854 3960323 Rantlers.
3960389 3962491 Unbelievable. It's like a billion...
3962558 3966195 Whoa! Come on. Look who's here! You know this guy.
3966262 3967930 You got a weird family.
3967997 3969865 Don't I know.
3969932 3971767 It's gonna be next Christmas before he gets down.
3971834 3974503 Hey, let's put it together for Santa! Hey!
3974570 3976305 Merry X-mas. Yo, yo, yo.
3976372 3978407 Hey, I don't think you got it right, Santa.
3978474 3981210 No, no, no. It's, "Ho, ho, ho."
3981277 3982745 What's the freakin' difference?
3982812 3984513 Where I come from, it's, "Yo, yo, yo."
3984580 3986782 Oh, looks like we got a 90-proof Santa.
3986849 3988684 Hey, Santa,
3988751 3991487 tell all the kids what you got in the bag for them
3991554 3993222 that you brought from the North.
3993289 3994790 (LAUGHING) Yeah, I got my laundry.
3994857 3996592 No, you got the wrong bag.
3996659 3998427 Come on, chubby, get out of the way. Yo, watch it.
3998494 4000229 Let Santa take a seat.
4000296 4001998 Come here, little boy. You been nice?
4002064 4004300 Uncle Paulie! Come over here. Sit down here.
4004367 4006702 Hey, kid, why don't you tell Santa what you need? What you...
4006769 4009505 He's stretchin' the clothes, man. I don't need nothin'.
4009572 4012108 Hey, kid, tell Santa what you really want. Come on.
4012174 4015478 That ain't Santa. It's Uncle Paulie. Let's get real.
4015544 4018381 ROCKY: What do you mean, "Get real"? You know, why you talkin' like that?
4018447 4020416 We're just trying to have a good time,
4020483 4022718 and Santa's here and everything and...
4022785 4024820 It's stupid!
4024887 4027757 Yo, you know, come on. It ain't stupid.
4027823 4029625 We're just tryin' to pretend here.
4029692 4031894 But you see you're supposed to be pretending.
4031961 4034630 It's like this game, right? You know?
4034697 4037466 I don't like pretending. Why don't you guys talk to Santa?
4037533 4039602 Hey, yo, kid, you know, I ain't talkin' to them.
4039668 4041771 I'm talkin' with you, here, you know.
4041837 4045007 See, it's very important that you spend time with the family,
4045074 4048778 you know, and have a good time and just gettin' the spirit goin', you know...
4048844 4050279 It's good, right?
4050346 4051747 Good for what? Come on, let's go.
4053449 4056285 Look, his friends are here. Maybe he doesn't want to.
4056352 4058521 Adrian, I know what he wants.
4058587 4060256 How do you know what I want?
4060322 4061357 'Cause I know you.
4061424 4063159 You know me?
4063225 4064860 He thinks he knows me.
4064927 4066562 (SCOFFS)
4066629 4068864 Look, I ain't celebratin' nothin', okay?
4068931 4071133 Hey, wait a minute. Hey, yo, come here. What's the matter with you?
4071200 4072802 You know? We always done this before.
4072868 4074637 We always had a good time, Adrian, you know?
4074703 4077106 We don't have to change nothin', never.
4077173 4081410 I mean, do you remember last year when we had fun, when we had a good time?
4081477 4084380 It ain't last year, and you ain't the same either.
4086582 4087616 What?
4091654 4093456 Adrian, what... What did I do?
4094190 4095324 Go talk to him.
4099261 4101597 Even I could've saw this thing happening.
4101664 4103732 I should have went to Miami when I had the chance.
4105701 4109305 You wanna talk, let's talk.
4109371 4113375 Uh, you know, I thought we was supposed to be, like, like, uh,
4113442 4115211 you know, be very close.
4115277 4116745 Hey, come on, kid. I love you.
4116812 4118814 No, you don't.
4118881 4121550 Sure I do, you know? Do you remember what the deal was?
4121617 4125488 We were supposed to be, like, tight, like crossed fingers.
4125554 4128023 No, no, what you want is you and Tommy to be tight.
4128090 4130459 That's who you're really talking about. Oh, don't say that.
4130526 4132628 Why can't I say it?
4132695 4134930 Since he's been here, it's been "Tommy this, Tommy that."
4134997 4137199 You don't have no time for nobody, so I got no time for you.
4137266 4140002 Hey, what are you saying to me, kid? You're like another person.
4140069 4142171 You're the other person!
4142238 4144807 You said I would be number one to you! You said that and you lied!
4144874 4147276 You lied to me and you lied to Mom!
4147343 4149411 I never lied to you.
4149478 4151080 Tommy needed my help.
4151147 4153282 So did I.
4153349 4156552 And remember when you said to watch out for scams and deceptions?
4157186 4158821 Yeah?
4158888 4161524 You're the one that should have watched out.
4168631 4170366 Where you going? Out.
4170432 4172201 When are you coming back? Later.
4172268 4174436 Later? When? Later.
4179108 4181610 DUKE: Season's greetings, Mrs. Balboa.
4182878 4184313 You take care of these people.
4184380 4186515 (DUKE LAUGHING)
4186582 4189852 Behold, a Santa for all seasons!
4189919 4191187 (ALL LAUGHING)
4191253 4193122 What, are you guys lost?
4193189 4194757 Au contraire, mon ami.
4194823 4196892 I know exactly where I am.
4196959 4198227 (DUKE LAUGHING)
4198294 4199762 Yo, Rocko!
4199828 4201697 Guess what's comin' to dinner?
4201764 4203699 PAULIE: Tommy Gunn's got new friends.
4203766 4205834 DUKE: New friends for a new year.
4207102 4209738 Oh, please. Oh, Paulie.
4210606 4212741 Nice tree. Charming.
4213709 4215611 Hey, Tommy, how you doin'?
4215678 4218480 Merry Christmas, my lord. Greetings!
4218547 4220583 Yeah, how you doin'?
4220649 4222718 DUKE: Listen, I don't wanna take up too much time.
4222785 4224286 I just wanted to come give a little season's greetings.
4224353 4225688 I don't need no presents.
4225754 4228090 Give them to the neighbors.
4228157 4230559 Look, you've done a hell of a job with the man. Facts are facts.
4230626 4232795 I'd have to be blind if I didn't say a title shot isn't in the cards.
4232861 4235030 Title shot?
4235097 4236532 That's right, title shot. Now, we're gonna work beautifully together.
4236599 4237866 No problems.
4238901 4239902 No friction.
4240936 4242605 Only harmony, huh?
4242671 4245174 It's time to put some hustle behind this muscle.
4245241 4248711 Why, our Tommy boy here's got a little something personal to discuss with you.
4248777 4250613 So I'm gonna be sayin' good night.
4250679 4252181 Merry Christmas.
4252248 4253716 KAREN: Merry Christmas to you.
4253782 4256552 See you soon, huh? Bye.
4256619 4258220 Sorry I'm late. I ended up having dinner.
4258287 4259722 Let's go.
4259788 4261824 Hey, that's okay, Tommy, you know,
4261890 4264493 Adrian cooked something, but it's probably all cold now.
4264560 4266862 What we can do is make sandwiches. It's no big...
4266929 4269064 Rocky, I don't wanna make sandwiches.
4269131 4271767 I don't wanna make... No. Tommy, why did you bring him here?
4271834 4273969 He just wanted to come by.
4274036 4275604 Oh, Tommy... Rocky, do you mind if I talk to you outside
4275671 4276905 about a few things?
4276972 4279074 Oh, yeah, sure.
4279141 4281777 It's getting late. We have to be there by 10:00.
4281844 4283612 (WHISPERING) Rocky. No, it's okay.
4286015 4287750 (DOOR CLOSES)
4287816 4290452 Hey, Tommy, what did you wanna talk to me about?
4290519 4292488 Isn't it a long drive? Yeah.
4292554 4294957 So, uh, what do you think?
4295024 4296458 Well, where'd you get this from?
4296525 4297426 Duke gave it to me.
4297493 4299762 Tommy!
4299828 4302097 Hey, you know, maybe you ought to give this thing back, you know, Tom.
4302164 4304500 And I knew it. I knew you were gonna say that.
4304566 4307703 Give it back? Why? I mean, the guy likes the way I fight.
4307770 4309938 It's almost 10:00. All right. We'll make it.
4310005 4312675 I know, but, you know, you see what he's doing, here, Tommy?
4312741 4315311 Hey, don't let him put nothin' between us, okay?
4315377 4317413 We got something good going here. "Put"? Like what?
4317479 4319682 I mean, the guy was just talking about gettin' a shot...
4319748 4322017 But we don't need him, you know what I mean?
4322084 4324019 I mean, you're gonna get a shot.
4324086 4325921 You're gonna be able to buy 10 of these things here.
4325988 4327690 Rock, when you gonna wake up, man?
4327756 4329825 We're watchin' the parade go by.
4329892 4332261 (STAMMERING) What parade? What are you talking about?
4332328 4334630 What parade? The big time.
4334697 4336932 Man, the way I'm going, I'm not gonna get a shot at the title for a long time.
4336999 4338767 Now, listen, Tommy... And I've got a perfect record.
4338834 4340636 I'm 22 and 0. Where's the money? Where?
4340703 4342471 Man, we haven't made any serious money yet.
4342538 4344006 And we won't without the man.
4344073 4345908 I ain't talkin' about the money.
4345974 4347676 Look, the money is gonna be there, but lis...
4347743 4349678 I'm talkin' about your rep, Tommy.
4349745 4351647 Look, don't sell out. Don't. We don't need this guy.
4351714 4353882 Listen, Duke is a wonderful man. Put the top up.
4353949 4355718 Hey, forget about the top, would you?
4355784 4358120 I'm signing papers with the man tomorrow.
4358187 4360389 No, listen to me, Tommy, you sign them papers, you're like his property.
4360456 4362825 You see, you got no control. You know, this is a dirty business.
4362891 4365327 It's full of these thieves and gangsters, you know,
4365394 4369064 and they promise every good young fighter who comes along...
4369131 4373068 They promise them the world, and then they suck them dry.
4373135 4374937 And they leave them when they ain't worth nothin'.
4375003 4376672 They leave them in the gutter, broke, Tommy!
4376739 4378507 That's the way this business is run.
4378574 4380376 Look, guys like Duke, you know what he is?
4380442 4384413 He's a vampire. He's livin' off your blood, Tommy.
4384480 4387649 You know, the thing I'm trying to do is what Mick done for me.
4387716 4391286 He tried to keep me away from the dirty part of the business,
4391353 4392855 the way I'm trying to do for you.
4392921 4394990 Man, I ain't you! And you ain't Mick!
4395057 4397226 Man, when are you gonna understand that?
4397292 4398827 When are you gonna understand that this is a business?
4398894 4400129 In a business you need...
4400195 4401363 What, brains?
4401430 4403265 You said that, not me.
4403332 4405234 Is that what you're saying? You're saying I got no brains?
4405300 4407102 Look, Rocky, you took me as far as you could.
4407169 4409605 But Duke gave me my title shot, you didn't.
4409671 4411607 And if you wanna keep trainin' me, then do it. But if you don't, don't!
4411673 4412808 But it's my way or it's the highway!
4412875 4413942 (TIRES SCREECHING)
4414009 4414943 Tommy!
4415811 4417679 (CROWD CHEERING)
4423352 4427589 Rocky, put on your coat. Just put on your coat.
4427656 4429958 Come on. It's not worth it.
4430025 4432761 Adrian, it is worth it. He's just confused.
4432828 4434496 You don't see what's happening under your eyes.
4434563 4436298 Yeah, I do see! What... Yeah, he's...
4436365 4438600 He's twisted around by Duke. I see what's happening.
4438667 4441136 No, come on, it's you, it's not him. You can't live backwards.
4441203 4443639 Come on, you can't turn back the clocks. We live now, we live here.
4443705 4446008 Hey, Adrian, I know where we live. What, do you think I'm stupid?
4446074 4448310 I'm not as dumb as you think I am!
4448377 4450813 (STAMMERING) You don't think I can smell it?
4450879 4452548 I see where we are.
4452614 4454516 Adrian, I don't want this no more.
4454583 4457219 I want something good for the family. I don't want this.
4457286 4459555 I don't want this!
4459621 4462758 I mean, did I come back here and get my brains beat out for these guys to say,
4462825 4464593 "Hey, there goes Balboa"?
4464660 4466662 I'm just another bum in the neighborhood!
4467463 4468831 I didn't want this!
4468897 4471066 No, come on. Nobody says that!
4471133 4473435 I'm sayin' it, Adrian. I'm sayin' this.
4473502 4475437 I'm sayin' this.
4475504 4477606 When that kid was in the ring, you know what I was doin'?
4477673 4479808 I was winnin'. When he was winnin', I was winnin'.
4479875 4482244 You were winning? Yeah. It was...
4482311 4485180 It was like... It was my last chance at gettin' some respect for us.
4485247 4487449 Do you know that? Come on, I respect you.
4487516 4489318 I respect you. Yes, I do. It's gone! You can't respect me.
4489384 4490953 I don't respect myself. No, you can't do it!
4491019 4492788 I do! Don't tell me that.
4492855 4494590 All those beatings you took in the ring.
4494656 4496792 I took them with you.
4496859 4498961 I know how you feel.
4499027 4502164 I know when somebody like Tommy comes along, you feel alive.
4502231 4504700 But he's not you. He doesn't have your heart.
4504766 4506568 All those fighters you beat,
4506635 4509004 you beat 'em with heart, not muscle.
4509071 4510873 That's what Mickey knew.
4510939 4512741 That's why you and Mickey were special.
4512808 4515310 But Mickey's dead!
4515377 4518780 If there's something you want to pass on, pass it on to your son.
4518847 4522117 For God's sakes, your son is lost.
4523151 4525087 He needs you!
4525153 4527990 I know Tommy makes you feel great.
4528056 4530792 He makes you feel like you're winning again.
4530859 4533629 But you're losing us!
4533695 4535731 Rocky, you're losing your family!
4536698 4538800 (SOBBING)
4543472 4545741 I'm sorry.
4545807 4548076 You know it was always you and me.
4548143 4549578 It was always you and me.
4552447 4554116 I'm sorry, Adrian.
4556151 4558287 ROCKY JR.: I don't know about you guys,
4559855 4561990 but I gotta get out of here.
4563625 4565594 Hey, what do you say we go to the shore, huh?
4565661 4567362 Yeah, let's go.
4567429 4569197 Oh, yeah, great. How are we gonna get there?
4569264 4571133 What do you mean how we gonna get there?
4571199 4572701 We throw our thumbs in the air. We'll hitchhike.
4572768 4573869 Uh, yo.
4573936 4575504 Oh, what's he want?
4575571 4576972 You want me to stay with you?
4577039 4578774 No.
4578840 4580876 Yeah, right. I got enough problems with my old man. Come on.

4584680 4586848 No, I ain't gonna hit him. No.
4588717 4591653 Yo, kid, when you start smokin'?
4591720 4593589 I don't know. Didn't you ever smoke?
4593655 4596191 Uh, yeah, I done a lot of bad things, you know?
4597526 4598660 So?
4600228 4603465 So, I... You know, I wised up.
4603532 4606234 Okay, so maybe I'll wise up someday, too.
4608370 4613308 Maybe tonight's a good night for both of us to start this wising-up thing.
4614543 4615844 Hey, don't worry about it.
4615911 4617913 I gotta worry about it.
4617980 4620015 I mean, the deal was we were supposed to be tight, right?
4620082 4621416 What about Tommy? You tight with him too, huh?
4623885 4625253 Tommy.

4638667 4640802 You know, kid,
4640869 4644373 you remember you were tellin' me a long time ago about deceptions,
4644439 4647142 and I was talking to you about scams and...
4647209 4650746 I should have listened to you. I was trying to teach you.
4650812 4654416 All right? But you, you were teaching me and I didn't wise up.
4654483 4656852 And I didn't know, and I made mistakes,
4656918 4658320 and I do things, you know.
4660555 4663992 It bothers me, you know? I forget a lot of things.
4664059 4666962 I... Just...

5076304 5078073 Yeah!
5078139 5079808 Do you think the fight was too easy?
5079874 5081743 He hit me a few good shots. But I was never hurt.
5081810 5083745 I mean, I'm just glad to be the champ. Yeah!
5083812 5086114 Tommy, don't you think that this looked more like
5086181 5089451 a Philadelphia sparring session at times instead of a championship match?
5089517 5091152 It didn't look like you broke a sweat.
5091219 5092687 DUKE: Yeah, you're very observant.
5092754 5095090 Union Cane wasn't feeling that good.
5095156 5099227 But Tommy Gunn would have done the same thing if Union was 100%. Next.
5099294 5102697 100%? He fought like he didn't have a heartbeat. Come on!
5102764 5104699 Everybody knows that Cane is just a paper champion.
5104766 5106468 What do he mean by "paper champion"?
5106534 5108336 It means Cane's title was manufactured.
5108403 5110238 He never won it from Balboa.
5110305 5113007 Gentlemen, give the boy a break. Union Cane is for real.
5113074 5114943 Tommy, you ever think you're gonna get out from underneath Rocky Balboa's shadow?
5115009 5116778 Man, I won the title. What more do I have to do?
5116845 5118646 REPORTER: I'll tell you what you have to do,
5118713 5120849 you've gotta fight some real opponents, right?
5120915 5122884 Balboa fought them all. But I beat the best tonight.
5122951 5124752 The best? The best? This guy's a bum.
5124819 5126855 He doesn't even deserve a shot at the title.
5126921 5129157 Gentlemen, whoa, whoa, whoa. We're getting carried away.
5129224 5131960 Now, Union Cane was the recognized champ. Next question.
5132026 5134629 We know the rating system can be manipulated.
5134696 5137565 The bottom line is Tommy Gunn beat a second-rate fighter
5137632 5140135 with so much glass in his jaw, he ought to be a chandelier.
5140201 5144105 DUKE: Say what you want, but this man will prove to be a great champion.
5144172 5147408 He might win a few fights, but a Rocky Balboa he'll never be.
5147475 5150411 No, no, no. He's no Rocky Balboa. Let's face it.
5150478 5153882 There is only one Balboa. Now, Balboa was a true people's champion.
5153948 5157752 But in time, Tommy Gunn may be able to fill his shoes. Next question.
5157819 5160355 MAN: Not by fighting stiffs like Cane, he won't.
5160421 5162123 Man, I'll fight anybody anywhere!
5162190 5164926 Who? When? When are you gonna fight a real fighter?
5164993 5167228 Gentlemen, gentlemen, gentlemen, come on.
5167295 5169597 We want to thank you for coming tonight, and we'll look forward...
5169664 5172033 Hey, Tommy, I got somethin' for you.
5172100 5174469 For your next fight, why don't you fight the redhead in the front row?
5174536 5176271 I hear she comes real cheap. Huh? What about that?
5176337 5178306 (REPORTERS WHOOPING)
5178373 5181676 DUKE: We look forward to seeing you at Tommy Gunn's next fight.
5181743 5183945 Why the hell did you say Balboa was better, man?
5184012 5185613 Do you believe he's better? Of course not.
5185680 5187248 But we can't talk in here, huh?
5187315 5189117 You the champ. You the champ.
5189184 5190885 MAN: Who are you gonna fight for the next fight, Tommy?
5190952 5193021 Man, what the hell happened in there?
5193087 5194923 I won the damn title, and these people think I'm a bum!
5194989 5197192 Why didn't you take up for me in there?
5197258 5199027 Oh, listen to me, when the press is right, they're right.
5199093 5200828 Right? Man, I'm as good as Balboa ever was.
5200895 5202764 I don't give a damn about what they say.
5202830 5205266 And I'm tired of being called a damn robot, too!
5205333 5206701 Listen to me, Tommy Gunn. You can't fight the press. I can't fight the press.
5206768 5208770 Oh, God!
5208836 5210505 As long as they got Balboa on the brain, he'll always be champ.
5210572 5213007 The man fought wars in the ring.
5213074 5214709 Tommy, face facts. You're in his shadow. I don't know if there's any way out.
5214776 5216311 This is your own man talking!
5216377 5218246 No, no, no! Listen to me.
5218313 5220615 There's a way for you to get the respect you deserve,
5220682 5223351 but what you've got to do is challenge Balboa to fight man-to-man.
5223418 5225453 That's right. Georgie here could set this fight up abroad in a matter of weeks.
5225520 5227355 Oh, yeah, it'd be the greatest fight ever.
5227422 5229791 Teacher against student. Old lion against young lion.
5229857 5231526 And it's the only way you're ever gonna get peace of mind,
5231593 5233561 'cause believe me when I tell you
5233628 5235430 that press is gonna hound you with that man's legend
5235496 5237165 for as long as you dare to wear boxing gloves.
5237232 5239367 You've got to get him into that ring, Tommy Gunn,
5239434 5241069 or you're gonna be hearing questions like you heard tonight
5241135 5243238 for the rest of your life.
5243304 5244739 Then you're gonna start to ask yourself, "Could I really take him?
5244806 5246641 "Am I really good enough?
5246708 5249043 "Do people really think I'm a cheap carbon copy
5249110 5253147 "or a second-rate pretender who only got a shot because of my skin tone?"
5253214 5255550 You've got to challenge that man to fight, Tommy Gunn.
5255617 5257986 And if he refuses, then you gotta insult him!
5258052 5260555 You gotta dog him. You gotta humiliate him.
5260622 5262590 You gotta do whatever you got to do to get him into that ring,
5262657 5264692 but that's what you got to do.
