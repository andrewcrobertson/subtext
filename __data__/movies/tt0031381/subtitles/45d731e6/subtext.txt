14783057 14784968 What do we care<br />if we were expelled?
14785217 14787890 The war"s gonna start,<br />so we would"ve left anyhow.
14788137 14789775 War! Isn"t it<br />exciting, Scarlett?
14789977 14792411 - Those fool Yankees want a war.<br />- We"ll show them!
14792657 14795217 Fiddle-dee-dee.<br />War, war, war!
14795457 14798176 This war talk"s spoiling<br />all the fun at every party.
14798377 14800652 I get so bored I could scream.
14800857 14802973 Besides, there isn"t<br />going to be any war.
14803217 14806015 - Not gonna be any war?<br />- Of course there"ll be a war.
14806257 14808612 If either of you boys<br />says war once again...
14808857 14810085 ...l"ll go in the house.
14810337 14813249 - But, Scarlett!<br />- Don"t you want us to have a war?
14813457 14816290 - Wait a minute, honey, please!<br />- We"re sorry.
14818857 14820370 Well...
14821217 14824095 But remember, I warned you.
14824337 14825611 l"ve got an idea!
14825857 14828166 We"ll talk about the Wilkes"<br />barbecue at Twelve Oaks.
14828417 14830726 You"re eating barbecue<br />with us, aren"t you?
14830937 14833974 I haven"t thought about that yet.<br />l"ll think about that tomorrow.
14834177 14835053 We want all your waltzes.
14835257 14837566 First Brent, then me,<br />then Brent, and so on.
14837817 14840411 - Promise?<br />- Why, l"d just love to.
14840657 14844013 If only I didn"t have every one<br />of them taken already.
14844257 14846896 - You can"t do that to us!<br />- We"ll tell you a secret.
14847097 14848212 A secret? Who by?
14848457 14850015 You know Melanie Hamilton?
14850257 14852566 Ashley Wilkes" cousin?<br />She"s visiting...
14852777 14855416 That goody-goody!<br />Who wants to know about her?
14855657 14857090 Anyway, we heard...<br />They say...
14857337 14859293 Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.
14859537 14862973 - Wilkeses always marry their cousins.<br />- Do we get those waltzes?
14863177 14864576 Of course.
14869817 14872615 It can"t be true! Ashley loves me!
14873777 14876928 - What"s gotten into her?<br />- Suppose we made her mad?
14877177 14880692 Where are you going without your<br />shawl and the night air coming?
14880937 14883292 How come you didn"t ask them<br />gentlemen to supper?
14883537 14885653 You got no more manners<br />than a field hand.
14885857 14888371 After me and Miss Ellen<br />done labored with you!
14888617 14891848 Come on in before you<br />catch your death of dampness.
14892457 14894971 No! L"m going to wait<br />for Pa to come home.
14895217 14896809 Come on in here!
14897057 14898570 Come on!
14912977 14914251 Quitting time!
14914497 14916806 - Who says it"s quitting time?<br />- I said.
14917057 14920015 l"s the foreman. I say<br />when it"s quitting time at Tara.
14920257 14921815 Quitting time!
14922217 14924173 Quitting time!
14963377 14966767 There"s none in the county can<br />touch you, and none in the state.
14967737 14969011 Pa!
14969217 14971367 How proud of yourself you are!
14973377 14977211 Well, Katie Scarlett O"Hara,<br />so you"ve been spying on me.
14977457 14980813 Like your sister, you"ll tell<br />your mother that I was jumping again.
14981017 14983087 You know l"m no tattletale<br />like Suellen.
14983337 14986613 But after you broke your knee<br />last year jumping that fence...
14986857 14991009 l"ll not have me own daughter telling<br />me what I shall jump and not jump.
14991257 14992610 It"s my own neck, so it is.
14992857 14994893 All right, Pa, you<br />jump what you please.
14995137 14997412 - How are they at Twelve Oaks?<br />- The Wilkeses?
14997617 15001610 In the stew you"d expect with a<br />barbecue and talking nothing but war.
15001857 15004769 Bother the war!<br />Was there anyone else there?
15004977 15007571 Their cousin Melanie<br />and her brother, Charles.
15007817 15011048 Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced,<br />mealy-mouthed ninny!
15011257 15012610 Ashley Wilkes doesn"t think so.
15012857 15015576 Ashley Wilkes couldn"t like<br />anyone like her.
15016217 15018970 What"s your interest in<br />Ashley and Miss Melanie?
15019777 15021688 Nothing. Let"s go into the house.
15021937 15025213 Has he been trifling with you?<br />Has he asked you to marry him?
15025417 15026213 Nor will he.
15026457 15029176 I had it in strict confidence from<br />John Wilkes today...
15029377 15031095 ...Ashley"s going to marry Melanie.
15031337 15033771 It"ll be announced<br />tomorrow night at the ball.
15034177 15035212 I don"t believe it!
15035937 15037973 Here! Where are you off to?
15038177 15039007 Scarlett!
15039657 15040851 What are you about?
15042217 15045971 Have you been running after<br />a man who"s not in love with you?
15046177 15047849 When you might have any other?
15048057 15049968 I haven"t been running<br />after him, it"s...
15050217 15051366 ...just a surprise.
15051617 15054006 Now, don"t be jerking<br />your chin at me!
15054257 15057408 If Ashley wanted to marry you,<br />l"d have misgivings.
15057657 15060808 I want my girl to be happy.<br />You"d not be happy with him.
15061057 15062206 I would! I would!
15062457 15066450 What"s the difference who you marry?<br />So long as he"s a Southerner.
15066657 15069125 And when l"m gone,<br />l"ll leave Tara to you.
15069377 15071208 I don"t want it.<br />It doesn"t mean anything...
15071457 15073607 Do you mean to tell me,<br />Katie Scarlett...
15073857 15075893 ...that land doesn"t mean<br />anything to you?
15076137 15078412 Land is the only thing in the<br />world worth working for...
15078657 15080409 ...worth fighting for, worth dying for.
15080617 15083814 - It"s the only thing that lasts!<br />- You talk like an Irishman.
15084057 15087766 It"s proud I am that l"m Irish.<br />Don"t you be forgetting...
15087977 15089205 ...that you"re half Irish too.
15089457 15091607 To anyone with a drop<br />of Irish blood in them...
15091857 15093768 ...the land they live on<br />is like their mother.
15094017 15095973 But there now. You"re<br />just a child.
15096177 15098213 It"ll come to you,<br />this love of the land.
15098457 15101176 There"s no getting away from it<br />if you"re Irish.
15124777 15125573 Here she comes!
15125777 15128211 Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen,<br />your mama"s home!
15128457 15131176 Acting like a wet nurse to<br />them white-trash Slatterys...
15131377 15134335 ...instead of eating her supper.<br />Set up the fire!
15134577 15136454 Got no business wearing herself out...
15136657 15138887 Pork! Take the lamp<br />out on the porch.
15139137 15142209 Wearing herself out.<br />Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen"s home!
15142457 15144368 Waiting on them poor white trash.
15144617 15146414 Shut up, dog!<br />Barking in the house!
15146657 15148966 Get up from there!<br />Don"t you hear Miss Ellen?
15149217 15151412 Get out there and get<br />her medicine chest!
15151777 15153893 We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.
15154137 15156367 It"s all right, Pork. L"m home.
15156857 15160372 Mrs. O"Hara, we finished plowing<br />the creek bottom today.
15160577 15162966 What do you want me<br />to start on tomorrow?
15163177 15166613 Mr. Wilkerson, l"ve just come<br />from Emmie Slattery"s bedside.
15166857 15168210 Your child has been born.
15168457 15171494 My child, ma"am?<br />l"m sure I don"t understand.
15171737 15174615 Has been born and<br />mercifully has died.
15174857 15176768 Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
15179577 15181807 I fix your supper myself<br />and you eats it.
15182057 15184571 - Yes, after prayers, Mammy.<br />- Yes"m.
15185377 15188574 Mr. O"Hara, you must<br />dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
15188817 15192207 Dismiss him, Mrs. O"Hara?<br />He"s the best overseer in the county.
15192457 15194971 He must go tomorrow morning,<br />the first thing!
15199017 15201611 The Yankee Wilkerson and<br />the white-trash Slattery girl?
15201857 15205133 - We"ll discuss it later, Mr. O"Hara.<br />- Yes, Mrs. O"Hara.
15205937 15208576 Scarlett"s dress<br />is prettier than mine!
15208977 15211810 Can"t she wear my pink?<br />I wanna wear Scarlett"s green dress.
15212057 15215015 I don"t like your tone, Suellen.<br />Your pink gown"s lovely.
15215257 15218010 - Can"t I stay up for the ball?<br />- You may wear my garnets.
15218257 15220771 Why can"t I stay up for<br />the ball tomorrow?
15222617 15225768 You look tired, my dear.<br />l"m worried about you.
15226017 15227370 l"m all right, Mother.
15227577 15230774 Why can"t I stay up for the ball?<br />l"m 13 now.
15231257 15233213 You may go to the barbecue.
15233457 15235573 I didn"t want your tacky dress anyhow!
15235817 15238377 - Hush up!<br />- Prayers, girls.
15244537 15249213 ...and to all the saints, that I have<br />sinned in thought, word and deed...
15249457 15254212 ...through my fault, through my fault,<br />through my most grievous fault.
15254457 15257574 Therefore, I beseech thee,<br />blessed Mary, ever virgin...
15257777 15259893 ...blessed Michael the Archangel...
15260137 15261809 ...blessed John the Baptist...
15262057 15266096 ...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul,<br />and all the saints...
15266337 15267611 ...pray to the Lord...
15267817 15269967 Ashley doesn"t know I love him.
15270937 15272734 l"ll tell him that I love him...
15272937 15275167 ...and then he can"t marry.
15275657 15278376 Hear thee Almighty,<br />most merciful Lord...
15278577 15282855 ...grant us pardon, absolution and<br />remission of our sins. Amen.
15285057 15288174 Just hold on and suck in!
15288377 15290572 Mammy, here"s<br />Miss Scarlett"s vittles.
15290817 15293206 Take it back to the kitchen.<br />I won"t eat a bite.
15293457 15294731 Yes"m, you is!
15294977 15296808 You"s gonna eat every mouthful.
15297457 15300574 No, l"m not!
15302497 15304374 Put on the dress.<br />We"re late already.
15304577 15306215 - What my lamb gonna wear?<br />- That.
15306457 15310166 No, you ain"t! You can"t show<br />your bosom before 3:00!
15310537 15312209 l"m gonna speak to your ma!
15312457 15315415 If you say one word to Mother,<br />I won"t eat a bite.
15319217 15320013 Well...
15326737 15330047 Keep your shawl on. I ain"t<br />aiming for you to get freckled...
15330257 15334569 ...after the buttermilk I done put<br />on you, bleaching them freckles.
15340377 15344973 Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on and be<br />good and eat just a little, honey.
15345177 15348852 l"m going to have a good time today<br />and eat at the barbecue.
15349097 15351736 If you don"t care<br />what folks says, I does!
15351937 15356852 You can always tell a lady by how<br />she eats in front of folks like a bird.
15357137 15361176 I ain"t aiming for you to go to<br />John Wilkes" and gobble like a hog!
15361377 15362810 Fiddle-dee-dee!
15363057 15366208 Ashley told me he likes<br />girls with a healthy appetite.
15366457 15369017 What gentlemens says and thinks<br />is different things.
15369257 15372090 And I ain"t noticed Mr. Ashley<br />asking for to marry you.
15387577 15391968 Now, don"t eat too fast. Ain"t no need<br />a having it come right back up again.
15393817 15396615 Why is it a girl has to be<br />so silly to catch a husband?
15396857 15400566 Scarlett O"Hara! If you"re not down<br />here by the time I count 10...
15400777 15402813 ...we"ll go without you!<br />- L"m coming, Pa!
15403057 15407972 One, two, three, four, five...
15409417 15410566 Oh, dear!
15410777 15414975 My stays are so tight, l"ll never<br />get through the day without belching!
15438137 15439616 Well, John Wilkes.
15439857 15442974 - It"s a grand day for the barbecue.<br />- So it seems, Gerald.
15443177 15444769 Why isn"t Mrs. O"Hara with you?
15445017 15448407 She"s settling accounts with the<br />overseer, but she"ll be along tonight.
15448617 15452132 - Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O"Hara.<br />- Thank you kindly, India.
15452337 15455329 Your daughter"s getting<br />prettier every day, John.
15455537 15458290 Here are the O"Hara girls.<br />We must greet them.
15458537 15461609 I can"t stand Scarlett.<br />She throws herself at Ashley.
15461937 15463416 That"s your brother"s business.
15463617 15465972 You must remember your<br />duties as hostess.
15466177 15468611 Good morning, girls.<br />You"re looking lovely.
15468857 15470575 Good morning, Scarlett.
15471177 15473771 India Wilkes,<br />what a lovely dress!
15473977 15476571 I just can"t take my eyes off it.
15477137 15478968 Good morning, Miss Scarlett.
15479657 15482569 You look mighty fine<br />this morning, Miss Scarlett.
15484457 15486766 It"s a pleasure to see you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
15489177 15490576 Ashley!
15492377 15494971 Scarlett, my dear!
15495457 15497368 l"ve been looking for you everywhere.
15497577 15501172 l"ve got something I must tell you.<br />Can"t we go someplace quiet?
15501377 15504813 Yes, l"d like to, but I have<br />something to tell you too.
15505057 15508493 Something I hope you"ll<br />be glad to hear.
15508737 15510773 Come say hello to<br />my cousin Melanie first.
15511017 15512575 Do we have to?
15512817 15515285 She"s been looking forward<br />to seeing you again.
15515537 15516333 Melanie!
15517817 15521127 - Here"s Scarlett.<br />- Scarlett!
15522137 15523616 l"m so glad to see you again.
15523857 15526417 Melanie, what a surprise<br />to run into you here.
15526617 15528767 I hope you"ll stay with us a few days.
15529017 15532327 I hope I shall stay long enough<br />for us to become real friends.
15532537 15535210 - I do want us to be.<br />- We"ll keep her here, won"t we?
15535657 15538012 We"ll make the biggest fuss over her!
15538257 15540896 If anybody can give a girl<br />a good time, it"s Ashley.
15541137 15544254 Our good times must seem silly<br />to you. You"re so serious.
15544497 15547057 Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
15547257 15550249 l"ve always admired you.<br />I wish I could be more like you.
15550497 15553170 You mustn"t flatter me<br />and say things you don"t mean.
15553417 15556807 Nobody could accuse Melanie of being<br />insincere. Could they, my dear?
15557017 15558973 She"s not like you,<br />is she, Ashley?
15559177 15561372 He never means a word<br />he says to any girl.
15562057 15565174 Why, Charles Hamilton, you<br />handsome old thing, you!
15565417 15566770 But, Miss O"Hara, I...
15567017 15571647 Was it kind to bring your good-looking<br />brother here to break my poor heart?
15571897 15575970 Now that Charles is your beau,<br />she"s after him like a hornet.
15576217 15578412 Charles, I want to eat<br />barbecue with you.
15578657 15582093 Don"t go philandering with any other<br />girl, because l"m mighty jealous.
15582337 15585534 I won"t, Miss O"Hara.<br />I couldn"t!
15585777 15589656 I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look<br />dashing with those new whiskers.
15589897 15592172 Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
15592617 15597486 Charles and Wade asked me to eat with<br />them, but I told them I promised you.
15597737 15601366 You needn"t be so amused.<br />She"s after your beau now.
15601617 15604415 That"s mighty flattering of you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
15604657 15606568 l"ll see what I can do.
15606817 15609206 Why"s your sister mad?<br />You sparking her beau?
15609417 15612170 As if I couldn"t do better<br />than that old maid in britches.
15612417 15614692 Brent and Stuart, you<br />handsome old things!
15614937 15616768 I didn"t mean it.<br />l"m mad at you!
15617017 15617972 What have we done?
15618217 15621607 You haven"t been near me all day!<br />I wore this old dress for you.
15621817 15623569 I was counting on eating with you.
15623817 15626377 - You are, Scarlett.<br />- Of course you are, honey.
15626577 15629967 I never can make up my mind which<br />of you is the handsomest.
15630217 15633448 I was awake all last night<br />trying to figure it out.
15633657 15635170 Oh, shucks!
15638577 15641137 - Cathleen, who"s that?<br />- Who?
15641337 15643407 That man looking at us and smiling.
15643657 15644726 The nasty dark one.
15644977 15648731 Don"t you know? That"s Rhett Butler.<br />He"s from Charleston.
15648977 15651366 He has a most terrible reputation.
15655577 15659365 He looks as if he knows what<br />I look like without my shimmy.
15660257 15662009 My dear, he isn"t received.
15662257 15665966 He spends his time up North<br />because his folks won"t speak to him.
15666177 15668372 He was expelled from<br />West Point, he"s so fast.
15668577 15671489 And there"s that business about<br />the girl he wouldn"t marry.
15671737 15672772 Tell, tell!
15672977 15677812 He took her out buggy-riding in<br />the late afternoon without a chaperon...
15678337 15680976 ...and then he refused to marry her!
15683377 15686767 No, but she was ruined just the same.
15691337 15692690 Ashley...
15692897 15693852 Happy?
15694057 15695775 So happy.
15696857 15698768 You seem to belong here...
15699057 15701571 ...as if it had all been<br />imagined for you.
15702857 15705052 I feel I belong<br />to the things you love.
15705257 15708055 - You love Twelve Oaks as I do.<br />- Yes, Ashley.
15708257 15711772 I love it as more than a house.
15711977 15715572 It"s a whole world that wants only<br />to be graceful and beautiful.
15715817 15719492 It"s so unaware that it<br />may not last forever.
15719737 15722774 You"re afraid of what may happen<br />if the war comes?
15722977 15725810 But we don"t have to be afraid for us.
15726017 15729168 No war can come into our world, Ashley.
15729417 15732375 Whatever comes, l"ll love you...
15732617 15736576 ...just as I do now, until I die.
15740417 15742169 Isn"t this better than a table?
15742417 15745170 A girl hasn"t got but two sides<br />to her at a table.
15746017 15747973 - L"ll get her dessert.<br />- She said me!
15748177 15749371 Allow me, Miss O"Hara?
15751657 15753568 I think...
15755937 15758371 I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
15760257 15763454 Thank you, Miss O"Hara.<br />Thank you!
15763657 15766569 Go get it, boy!<br />Isn"t he the luckiest...
15773977 15775569 Miss O"Hara...
15776457 15777970 ...I love you.
15778977 15781571 I don"t guess l"m as hungry<br />as I thought.
15784537 15787210 Why do I have to take a nap?<br />l"m not tired.
15787457 15789573 Well-brought-up ladies<br />takes naps at parties.
15789777 15793292 It"s time you behave and act<br />like you was Miss Ellen"s daughter.
15793537 15797291 When we were in Saratoga, I didn"t<br />see Yankee girls taking naps.
15797497 15800614 And you won"t see no Yankee<br />girls at the ball, neither.
15800857 15802210 How was Ashley today?
15802457 15804812 He didn"t pay much attention to you.
15805057 15806456 You mind your own business!
15806697 15808972 You"ll be lucky you don"t lose<br />whisker-face Kennedy.
15809177 15812567 You"re sweet on Ashley, and his<br />engagement"s being announced tonight.
15812777 15814574 That"s as much as you know.
15814977 15819209 You ought to behave yourself!<br />Acting like poor white-trash children!
15819417 15822136 If you"s old enough for parties,<br />you should act like ladies!
15822337 15823850 Who cares?
15872857 15875007 We"ve borne enough insults<br />from the Yankees.
15875257 15879170 We"ll keep our slaves<br />with or without their approval.
15879417 15882807 "Twas the sovereign right of<br />Georgia to secede from the Union.
15883017 15885690 The South must assert herself<br />by force of arms.
15885937 15889896 After we"ve fired on the Yankee rascals<br />at Fort Sumter, we"ve got to fight.
15890137 15892207 - There"s no other way.<br />- That"s right!
15892457 15894254 Let the Yankees ask for peace.
15894497 15898649 The situation"s very simple.<br />The Yankees can"t fight and we can.
15898857 15901417 There won"t be a battle.<br />They"ll turn and run.
15901657 15905332 - One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.<br />- We"ll finish them in one battle.
15905577 15907807 Gentlemen can always fight<br />better than rabble.
15908057 15909285 Gentlemen always fight better.
15909537 15911767 What does the captain<br />of our Troop say?
15912017 15912927 Well, gentlemen...
15913177 15916010 ...if Georgia fights, I go with her.
15916257 15919215 I hope the Yankees let us<br />leave the Union in peace.
15919457 15920810 Ashley, they"ve insulted us!
15921057 15922695 You can"t mean you don"t want war?
15922937 15926054 Most of the miseries of the world<br />were caused by wars.
15926257 15930967 And when the wars were over, no one<br />ever knew what they were about.
15932217 15935493 Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler"s<br />been up North, I hear.
15935737 15937056 Don"t you agree with us?
15938217 15940606 I think it"s hard winning<br />a war with words.
15940857 15942006 What do you mean, sir?
15942257 15944851 There"s not a cannon factory<br />in the whole South.
15945057 15946775 What difference does that make<br />to a gentleman?
15947017 15949815 It"ll make a great difference<br />to a great many gentlemen, sir.
15950057 15952651 Are you hinting<br />that the Yankees can lick us?
15952897 15953966 No, l"m not hinting.
15954217 15956811 l"m saying plainly, the<br />Yankees are better equipped than we.
15957057 15959127 They"ve got factories,<br />shipyards, coal mines...
15959337 15961976 ...and a fleet to bottle up our<br />harbors and starve us.
15962217 15964606 All we"ve got is cotton and slaves...
15964817 15965613 ...and arrogance.
15965857 15968417 I refuse to listen<br />to any renegade talk!
15968977 15972765 - L"m sorry if the truth offends you.<br />- Apologies aren"t enough, sir.
15973017 15975485 I hear you were<br />turned out of West Point.
15975777 15978211 And you aren"t received in<br />any family in Charleston.
15978457 15979572 Not even your own!
15984337 15987374 I apologize again<br />for all my shortcomings.
15988617 15991177 Perhaps you won"t mind if<br />I look over your place?
15991377 15994608 I seem to be spoiling everybody"s<br />brandy and cigars...
15994857 15996529 ...and dreams of victory.
16002977 16006287 That"s just what you can expect<br />from somebody like Rhett Butler.
16006537 16008175 You did everything but call him out.
16008417 16010567 - He refused to fight.<br />- Not quite.
16010817 16013411 - He refused to take advantage of you.<br />- Of me?
16013617 16018168 He"s one of the best shots in<br />the country, as he"s proved many times.
16018377 16019173 l"ll show him!
16019417 16021885 Please. Don"t go tweaking<br />his nose anymore.
16022177 16024975 You may be needed for more<br />important fighting.
16025177 16027372 If you"ll excuse me,<br />Mr. Butler"s our guest.
16027577 16029772 I think l"ll just show him around.
16054937 16056768 Who are you hiding from in here?
16061977 16063569 What are you up to?
16065657 16068774 Why aren"t you upstairs,<br />resting with the other girls?
16069657 16071454 What is this, Scarlett, a secret?
16074937 16077212 - I love you.<br />- Scarlett!
16077457 16079573 I love you, I do!
16080897 16084412 Isn"t it enough that you gathered<br />every other man"s heart today?
16084617 16086847 You"ve always had mine.<br />You cut your teeth on it.
16087097 16088416 Don"t tease me now.
16088657 16091376 Have I your heart, my darling?<br />I love you!
16091617 16093369 You mustn"t say such things.
16093617 16095175 You"ll hate me for hearing them.
16095377 16098892 I could never hate you,<br />and I know you must care about me.
16099457 16101766 You do care, don"t you?
16104137 16104933 I care.
16106777 16109974 Can"t we go away and forget<br />we ever said these things?
16111297 16112969 But how can we do that?
16114217 16116936 - Don"t you want to marry me?<br />- L"m going to marry Melanie.
16117137 16119367 But you can"t!<br />Not if you care for me!
16119617 16122768 Why must you make me say<br />things that will hurt you?
16123417 16125567 How can I make you understand?
16126057 16128810 You"re so young, you don"t<br />know what marriage means.
16129017 16131292 I know I love you,<br />and I want to be your wife.
16131537 16132890 You don"t love Melanie.
16133137 16134616 She"s like me, Scarlett.
16134857 16137166 She"s my blood and we<br />understand each other.
16137857 16139575 But you love me!
16139777 16141574 How could I help loving you?
16141777 16143972 You have all the passion<br />for life that I lack.
16144457 16148496 That kind of love isn"t enough for<br />two people as different as we are.
16148737 16151615 Why not say it, you coward?<br />You"re afraid to marry me.
16151857 16154007 You"d marry that fool<br />who can only say...
16154217 16157448 ...yes, no and raise<br />a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!
16157697 16158766 You mustn"t say that!
16159017 16161656 Who are you to tell me I mustn"t?<br />You led me on!
16161857 16164769 - You made me believe you"d marry me.<br />- Scarlett, be fair!
16164977 16167445 - I never at any time...<br />- It"s true, you did!
16167657 16169409 l"ll hate you till I die!
16169657 16173172 I can"t think of anything<br />bad enough to call you!
16198897 16199966 Has the war started?
16201057 16204447 Sir, you should have made<br />your presence known.
16204777 16206893 In the middle of that<br />beautiful love scene?
16207097 16209088 That wouldn"t have been<br />tactful, would it?
16209297 16211936 But don"t worry.<br />Your secret is safe with me.
16212177 16215772 - Sir, you are no gentleman.<br />- And you, miss, are no lady.
16215977 16219413 I don"t hold that against you.<br />Ladies never held any charm for me.
16219657 16222251 First you take advantage<br />of me, then you insult me!
16222497 16224010 I meant it as a compliment.
16224257 16228330 I hope to see more of you, when you"re<br />free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
16228577 16231535 He doesn"t strike me as good<br />enough for a girl of your...
16231777 16234291 What was it?<br />Your passion for living.
16234537 16237688 How dare you!<br />You aren"t fit to wipe his boots!
16238737 16241695 And you were going to hate him<br />for the rest of your life.
16243577 16247331 She certainly made a fool of<br />herself running after all the men.
16247577 16248930 That"s not fair, India.
16249177 16251930 She"s so attractive, men<br />naturally flock to her.
16252377 16254174 Melanie, you"re just too<br />good to be true.
16254417 16257887 - Didn"t you see her going after Charles?<br />- And she knows Charles belongs to me.
16258137 16259536 You"re wrong, India.
16259777 16262735 Scarlett"s just high-spirited<br />and vivacious.
16262977 16265730 Men flirt with girls like<br />that, but they don"t marry them.
16265937 16268497 I think you"re being very mean to her.
16290177 16291690 Miss O"Hara!
16295857 16298735 Mr. Lincoln"s called<br />volunteers to fight against us!
16298937 16301326 Don"t you men think<br />about anything important?
16301537 16305246 But it"s war! Everybody"s going<br />off to enlist. L"m going too!
16305457 16307095 Everybody?
16310577 16313137 Miss O"Hara, will you be sorry?
16313377 16314571 To see us go?
16314777 16317291 l"ll cry into my pillow every night.
16317497 16319169 Miss O"Hara, I told you I loved you.
16319377 16323529 You"re the most beautiful girl in the<br />world, and the sweetest, the dearest.
16323777 16325927 I couldn"t hope that you could love me.
16326177 16329453 l"m so clumsy and stupid and<br />not nearly good enough for you.
16329697 16334452 But if you could think of marrying me,<br />l"d do anything in the world for you.
16335297 16336286 What did you say?
16336537 16339893 Miss O"Hara, I said,<br />Would you marry me?
16344777 16347086 Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
16347297 16349731 You will? You"ll marry me?<br />You"ll wait for me?
16349937 16353486 - I don"t think l"d want to wait.<br />- You"ll marry me before I go?
16353897 16357173 Oh, Miss O"Hara! Scarlett.
16359177 16360496 When may I speak to your father?
16360697 16361686 The sooner the better.
16361897 16366095 l"ll go now, I can"t wait.<br />Will you excuse me, dear?
16367737 16369090 Dear!
16369937 16371734 Mr. O"Hara! Mr. O"Hara!
16371977 16376095 - It"ll be a week before they call me.<br />- A week till they take you away from me!
16408377 16410766 I thought of you at our<br />wedding yesterday...
16410977 16413127 ...and I hoped yours<br />would be as beautiful.
16413377 16415891 - And it was!<br />- Was it?
16416097 16419089 Now we"re really and truly sisters.
16428057 16429285 Don"t cry, darling.
16429497 16433695 The war will be over in a few weeks,<br />and l"ll be coming back to you.
16475497 16477294 Miss Scarlett!
16477537 16481086 I don"t care!<br />l"m too young to be a widow.
16483657 16486933 Why, l"d just go around<br />scaring people in that thing.
16487177 16489486 You shouldn"t be around people.<br />You"s in mourning!
16489697 16492336 For what? I don"t feel anything.
16492537 16495370 Why should I have to<br />pretend and pretend?
16495777 16497608 What is it?
16498777 16500893 Poor baby!
16501297 16502286 What is it?
16502497 16504089 My life is over!
16504337 16508296 - Nothing will ever happen to me anymore!<br />- Darling...
16509137 16512129 Mother, I know you think l"m horrible.
16512377 16514732 But I just can"t bear<br />going around in black.
16514977 16518890 It"s bad enough not being able to go to<br />parties. But looking this way too?
16519137 16520729 I don"t think you"re at all horrible.
16520977 16525129 It"s only natural you want to look<br />young and be young when you are young.
16525377 16527527 Oh, baby!
16527777 16530894 How would you like to visit<br />somewhere? Savannah, perhaps?
16531097 16533736 What would I do in Savannah?
16533937 16537088 Well, Atlanta then.<br />There"s lots going on there.
16537297 16540289 And you can stay with Melanie<br />and her Aunt Pittypat.
16540937 16542256 Melanie?
16544177 16545326 I could, couldn"t I?
16545577 16548535 Mother, you"re sweeter<br />than anybody in the world!
16548777 16550130 You"d like it, really?
16550377 16554495 All right, then. Now stop<br />your crying and smile.
16555137 16557253 You can take Prissy with you.
16557457 16559732 Start packing Miss Scarlett"s<br />things, Mammy.
16559977 16562491 l"ll go write the necessary letters.
16564737 16565726 Atlanta!
16565977 16569208 Savannah would be better.<br />You"ll get in trouble in Atlanta.
16569457 16570606 What are you talking about?
16570857 16574088 You know what l"s<br />talking about. Ashley Wilkes.
16574297 16578415 He"ll come to Atlanta for his leave, and<br />you waiting for him just like a spider!
16578657 16582093 - He belongs to Miss Melanie...<br />- Go pack my things like Mother said!
16601977 16604616 They"re all whispering,<br />and I know it"s about her!
16604857 16606813 What"s it matter, Pittypat?
16607057 16610811 Scarlett"s living under my roof, so<br />they think l"m responsible for her.
16611057 16614732 And for a widow to appear in public<br />at a social gathering...
16614977 16617491 ...every time I think of it,<br />I feel faint.
16617697 16621690 You know Scarlett came here only<br />to help raise money for the Cause.
16621897 16624730 It was splendid of her<br />to make the sacrifice.
16624977 16629892 Anyone hearing you talk would think she<br />came to dance instead of sell things.
16641777 16646453 Ladies and gentlemen, I have<br />important news! Glorious news!
16646697 16650087 Another triumph for our<br />magnificent men in arms!
16650297 16653130 General Lee has completely<br />whipped the enemy...
16653377 16657211 ...and swept the Yankee army<br />northward from Virginia!
16665977 16669128 And now, a happy surprise<br />for all of us.
16669377 16673609 We have with us tonight, that most<br />daring of all blockade runners...
16673857 16677008 ...whose fleet schooners,<br />slipping past the Yankee guns...
16677257 16681045 ...have brought us here the very<br />woolens and laces we wear tonight.
16681297 16685131 I refer to that will-o"-the-wisp<br />of the bounding main.
16685377 16687891 None other than our<br />friend from Charleston...
16688137 16689809 ...Captain Rhett Butler!
16709697 16711096 Permit me.
16715177 16718328 Captain Butler, such a pleasure<br />to see you again.
16718577 16720329 I met you last at my husband"s home.
16720577 16722932 That"s kind of you to remember,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
16723177 16725611 Did you meet Captain Butler<br />at Twelve Oaks?
16725857 16727848 Yes, I think so.
16728097 16730327 Only for a moment.<br />It was in the library.
16730577 16732727 You had broken something.
16733537 16735892 Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
16736137 16739766 Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your<br />jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause.
16740017 16741973 We aren"t wearing any.<br />We"re in mourning.
16742217 16743445 Wait.
16743657 16746694 On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br />and Mrs. Hamilton.
16746977 16748205 Thank you, Captain Butler.
16748457 16750687 Just a moment, please.
16752777 16754893 But it"s your wedding ring, ma"am.
16755097 16758612 It may help my husband more<br />off my finger.
16758857 16760290 Thank you.
16762137 16764207 That was a very beautiful thing to do.
16765257 16766326 Here.
16766577 16768852 You can have mine too.<br />For the Cause.
16771177 16775807 And you, Mrs. Hamilton. I know<br />just how much that means to you.
16776057 16778127 - Dr. Meade?<br />- I need your approval...
16778337 16781135 ...for something we want to do<br />that"s rather shocking.
16781937 16783131 Will you excuse us?
16785657 16789127 l"ll say one thing. The war<br />makes the most peculiar widows.
16789377 16790332 I wish you"d go!
16790577 16793694 If you had any raising, you"d know<br />l"d never want to see you again!
16796457 16797731 Now, why be silly?
16797977 16799490 You"ve no reason for hating me.
16799737 16802695 l"ll carry your guilty<br />secret to my grave.
16803537 16807086 l"d be very unpatriotic to hate<br />a great hero of the war.
16807297 16810494 I declare, I was surprised you<br />turned out to be a noble character.
16810697 16813894 I can"t bear to take advantage<br />of your little-girl ideas.
16814137 16816128 l"m neither noble nor heroic.
16816377 16819926 - But you are a blockade runner?<br />- For profit, and profit only.
16820137 16821809 You don"t believe in the Cause?
16822057 16826050 Rhett Butler is the only cause I know.<br />The rest doesn"t mean much to me.
16829377 16831095 And now, ladies and gentlemen...
16831337 16834170 ...I have a surprise to<br />benefit the hospital.
16836137 16839925 Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel<br />with the lady of your choice...
16840137 16841456 ...you must bid for her!
16843377 16847734 Caroline Meade, how can you let your<br />husband conduct this slave auction!
16847977 16850571 Darlene Merriwether,<br />how dare you criticize me!
16850777 16854975 Melanie told the doctor that if it"s<br />for the Cause, it"s quite all right.
16855177 16856132 She did?
16856377 16859494 Oh, dear! Oh, dear!<br />Where are my smelling salts?
16859697 16863167 - I think I shall faint.<br />- Don"t you dare faint, Pittypat!
16863377 16866813 If Melanie says it"s all right,<br />it is all right.
16867057 16869935 Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?<br />Make your offers!
16870577 16872488 Don"t be bashful, gentlemen!
16872977 16877050 $20! $20 for<br />Miss Maybelle Merriwether!
16877297 16879094 $25 for Miss Fanny Elsing!
16879337 16880929 Only $25 to give your...
16881177 16884886 - $ 150 in gold.<br />- For what lady, sir?
16885137 16887492 For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
16889817 16890727 For whom, sir?
16890977 16892695 Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
16892937 16894814 Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning.
16895057 16897696 But l"m sure any of our<br />belles would be proud to...
16897897 16900809 Dr. Meade, I said<br />Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
16901657 16903249 She will not consider it, sir.
16904097 16905450 Oh, yes, I will!
16917537 16919607 Choose your partners<br />for the Virginia reel!
16921257 16922929 We"ve shocked the Confederacy.
16923177 16924895 It"s like blockade running,<br />isn"t it?
16925097 16928089 It"s worse. I expect<br />a very fancy profit out of it.
16928297 16931209 I don"t care what you expect.<br />l"m gonna dance and dance!
16931457 16934893 Tonight I wouldn"t mind dancing<br />with Abe Lincoln himself!
16964977 16967286 Another dance and my<br />reputation will be lost.
16967497 16969692 With courage you<br />can do without one.
16969897 16971774 You do talk scandalous!
16979177 16981532 You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
16981777 16985326 Don"t start flirting with me.<br />l"m not one of your plantation beaus.
16985577 16987454 I want more than flirting from you.
16988177 16989929 What do you want?
16990177 16994932 l"ll tell you, if you"ll take that<br />Southern belle simper off your face.
16995177 16999295 Someday I want you to say to me the<br />words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes.
16999737 17001216 I love you.
17001457 17005086 That"s something you"ll never<br />hear from me as long as you live.
17024577 17029128 How sweet. How kind.<br />He is a thoughtful gentleman.
17029377 17033086 Fiddle-dee-dee! Why doesn"t he<br />say something about my sacrifice?
17040577 17042249 Oh, the darling thing!
17042457 17044413 Rhett, it"s lovely, lovely!
17044657 17047490 You didn"t bring it all the way<br />from Paris just for me.
17047697 17051485 I thought it was about time I got<br />you out of that fake mourning.
17051697 17055292 Next trip l"ll bring you some green<br />silk for a frock to match it.
17055537 17056890 It"s my duty to our...
17057137 17061335 ...brave boys at the front to<br />keep our girls at home looking pretty.
17061577 17063693 It"s so long since I had anything new!
17073777 17074653 How do I look?
17075977 17077695 Awful! Just awful!
17077937 17079256 Why? What"s the matter?
17079497 17083695 This war"s stopped being a joke when<br />a girl doesn"t know the latest fashion.
17088977 17092287 Oh, Rhett! Let me do it.
17096577 17100126 But, Rhett, I don"t know<br />how l"d dare wear it!
17100377 17101890 You will, though.
17102257 17104532 And another thing, those pantalets!
17104737 17107331 I don"t know a woman in Paris<br />who wears pantalets.
17107577 17111047 What do they... You shouldn"t<br />talk about such things.
17111257 17114727 You don"t mind my knowing about them,<br />just my talking about them.
17114937 17118327 I can"t go on accepting these<br />gifts, though you"re awfully kind.
17118577 17120295 l"m not kind. L"m tempting you.
17120497 17124046 I never give without expecting<br />something in return. I always get paid.
17124257 17126327 I won"t marry you<br />to pay for the bonnet.
17126577 17129535 Don"t flatter yourself.<br />l"m not a marrying man.
17129777 17132496 Well, I won"t kiss you<br />for it either.
17142177 17144293 Open your eyes and look at me.
17145257 17147009 No, I don"t think I will kiss you.
17147257 17148610 Although you need kissing, badly.
17148857 17151496 That"s what"s wrong with you.<br />You should be kissed, and often.
17151697 17152925 And by someone who knows how.
17153177 17155486 And I suppose you think you"re<br />the proper person!
17155737 17158729 I might be, if the right<br />moment ever came.
17158937 17161531 You"re a conceited,<br />black-hearted varmint!
17161777 17164086 I don"t know why<br />I let you come and see me.
17164537 17165811 l"ll tell you why, Scarlett.
17166057 17170335 l"m the only man over 16 and under 60<br />who"s around to show you a good time.
17170577 17173011 But cheer up.<br />The war can"t last much longer.
17173257 17174815 Really, Rhett? Why?
17175057 17177890 There"s a battle going on now<br />that ought to fix things...
17178097 17179689 ...one way or the other.
17179937 17181495 Is Ashley in it?
17182577 17185694 So you haven"t gotten the wooden-headed<br />Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
17185937 17189134 - Yes, I suppose he"s in it.<br />- But tell me, where is it?
17189377 17193086 Some little town in Pennsylvania<br />called Gettysburg.
17220777 17221573 Casualty lists!
17221977 17223695 Casualty lists!
17228257 17231090 Please! Please!
17270497 17274206 Here you is. They was fighting<br />for them so, it got tore in half.
17274457 17275890 Scarlett, you look.
17276137 17277729 The W"s at the end.
17280977 17285687 Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman,<br />Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman...
17285897 17288695 Scarlett, you"ve passed him!
17288897 17291331 He isn"t there! He isn"t there!
17291577 17293693 Ashley"s safe, he isn"t listed!
17293937 17296895 Oh, he"s safe. He"s safe!
17298057 17302687 Scarlett, you"re so sweet to<br />worry about Ashley like this for me.
17308577 17310693 I must go to her.
17311537 17313971 Don"t, my dear. Not here.
17314177 17315895 Let"s go home.
17316737 17318295 Dr. Meade, not...?
17318497 17321534 Yes, our boy Darcy.
17321777 17324689 I was making these mittens for him.
17324937 17327087 He won"t need them now.
17327697 17328925 Well, l"m gonna enlist.
17329177 17331293 l"ll show them!<br />l"ll kill those Yankees!
17331497 17332532 You hush your mouth.
17332777 17336770 You think it"ll help your mother to<br />have you shot too? Lt"s silly!
17339497 17340896 It"s a black day, Scarlett.
17341137 17342490 Haven"t had bad news, have you?
17342697 17345530 - Ashley"s safe.<br />- L"m glad, for Mrs. Wilkes" sake.
17345777 17347005 There are so many others.
17347257 17349896 - Any of your friends?<br />- About every family in the county.
17350097 17352486 The Tarleton boys, both of them.
17353177 17355896 Look at them.<br />All these poor tragic people.
17356137 17359925 The South"s sinking to its knees.<br />It"ll never rise again.
17360177 17361405 The Cause.
17361657 17364729 The cause of living in the past is<br />dying right in front of us.
17364977 17366729 I never heard you talk like that.
17366937 17371692 l"m angry. Waste always makes me angry<br />and that"s what this is, sheer waste!
17373057 17374570 But don"t you be downcast.
17374857 17378293 Ashley"s still alive to come<br />home to the women who love him.
17378497 17379896 Both of them.
17415097 17416325 You"re here!
17419857 17423008 You"re here!<br />You"re really here at last!
17423257 17425088 Oh, my dear, l"ve waited so long!
17425337 17427453 Melanie, my dear, my darling wife!
17431337 17433487 But we"re forgetting Scarlett.
17434497 17436488 Scarlett, dear.
17438377 17442131 Why, is this any way to greet<br />a returning warrior?
17442377 17443890 Ashley, I...
17446897 17449092 Merry Christmas, Ashley.
17456777 17460292 Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br />We"s ate all your wives.
17461057 17462729 We"s ate all your little chicks.
17462977 17465491 You got nobody to worry<br />your head about leaving.
17466497 17469489 Come on. Now you just<br />stand still so you...
17469697 17471688 ...can be Christmas<br />for the white folks.
17471937 17473575 Now, hold on!
17474097 17475450 Hold on!
17475657 17477170 Don"t go getting so uppity.
17477777 17480689 Even if you is the last<br />chicken in Atlanta.
17482537 17484528 Let"s not talk about the war.
17484777 17488213 Let"s talk Twelve Oaks and Tara<br />and times before there was a war.
17488457 17489685 Could we have the wine?
17489897 17492092 Why did you say there<br />wasn"t enough?
17492377 17495733 There"s plenty. It"s the very last<br />of my father"s fine Madeira.
17495937 17499532 He got it from his uncle<br />Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
17499777 17503087 ...who married his cousin<br />Jessica Carroll of Carrolton...
17503297 17506528 ...who was his second cousin<br />and akin to the Wilkeses too.
17506777 17510406 I saved it to wish Ashley<br />a merry Christmas.
17510777 17515692 But you mustn"t drink it all at once,<br />because it is the last.
17518977 17521696 I meant it, my dear.<br />It was a lovely Christmas gift.
17521937 17524007 Only generals have tunics like this.
17524257 17525815 l"m so happy you like it.
17526057 17527536 Where did you get the cloth?
17527777 17529688 It was sent by a Charleston lady.
17529937 17534089 I nursed her son while he was<br />in the hospital before he died and...
17534577 17536886 You will take good care<br />of it, won"t you?
17537097 17540294 You won"t let it get torn.<br />Promise me.
17540537 17541890 You mustn"t worry.
17542137 17546096 l"ll bring it back to you without<br />any holes in it. I promise.
17548297 17549207 Good night, my dear.
17549457 17551493 Good night, Scarlett, darling.
17563977 17566127 Uncle Peter, is it time<br />for Mr. Ashley to leave?
17566377 17567890 Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
17568097 17571885 Melanie isn"t going to the depot?<br />She hasn"t changed her mind?
17572097 17573052 She"s laying down.
17573257 17577694 She"s so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her<br />she can"t even come downstairs.
17588537 17591097 Ashley, let me go to<br />the depot with you.
17591457 17594494 Scarlett, l"d rather remember<br />you as you are now.
17594737 17596887 Not shivering at the depot.
17597177 17598496 All right.
17599857 17602087 l"ve got a present for you too!
17608257 17610691 Why, Scarlett, it"s beautiful!
17610897 17613092 Tie it on me, my dear.
17613857 17617691 While Melly was making a new tunic,<br />I made this to go with it.
17617937 17619893 You made it yourself?
17620097 17622691 Well, then I shall<br />value it all the more.
17623337 17626295 You know there"s nothing<br />I wouldn"t do for you.
17626977 17628695 There"s something you can do for me.
17628937 17630131 What is it?
17630377 17632686 Will you look after Melanie for me?
17633297 17636812 She"s so frail and gentle,<br />and she loves you so much.
17637057 17639935 - Lf I were killed...<br />- You mustn"t say that! Lt"s bad luck.
17640177 17641735 Say a prayer, quickly.
17641977 17643888 You say one for me.
17644377 17647608 We shall need all our prayers.<br />Now the end is coming.
17647857 17648653 The end?
17648857 17650495 The end of the war...
17651097 17653486 ...and the end of our world, Scarlett.
17654177 17656896 But you don"t think<br />the Yankees are beating us?
17658137 17660571 My men are barefooted now!
17660777 17663496 And the snow in Virginia"s deep.
17663777 17667690 When I see them, and I see<br />the Yankees coming and coming...
17667937 17670895 ...always more and more!
17672657 17674807 When the end does come,<br />I shall be far away.
17676257 17678896 It"ll be a comfort to me<br />to know that she has you.
17679657 17682490 You will promise, won"t you?
17684097 17685450 Yes.
17686377 17688811 Is that all, Ashley?
17689057 17691935 All except... goodbye.
17692177 17693610 I can"t let you go!
17693857 17696735 You must be brave. You must!
17696977 17699093 How else can I bear going?
17699737 17704094 Oh, Scarlett! You"re so fine<br />and strong and beautiful.
17704537 17707131 Not just your sweet face, my dear...
17707377 17708890 ...but you.
17712977 17716287 Ashley, kiss me. Kiss me goodbye.
17722577 17723532 No, Scarlett. No!
17723777 17725449 Ashley, I love you.
17725657 17728535 l"ve always loved you.<br />l"ve never loved anyone else.
17728737 17731092 I only married Charles just to hurt you.
17731297 17734289 Ashley, tell me you love me.
17734537 17737290 l"ll live on it<br />the rest of my life!
17738537 17740095 Goodbye.
17758697 17761086 When the war"s over, Ashley.
17761657 17763693 When the war"s over.
17782857 17785087 ...and there"s a place back home...
17785337 17789330 ...where a wild plum tree comes<br />to flower in the springtime...
17789577 17791408 ...down by the creek, you know.
17791657 17793807 Yes, I know, I know.
17794057 17797094 When we were little, my brother<br />Jeff and I used to...
17797297 17800892 I told you about my brother Jeff,<br />didn"t I, ma"am?
17801097 17803895 I know I did. He...
17804097 17806895 We don"t know where Jeff is now, ma"am.
17807137 17810686 Since Bull Run, we haven"t<br />heard anything and...
17810897 17812933 Please, we must have your<br />temperature now.
17813177 17817329 Just take this in your mouth and not<br />talk anymore. Not just now.
17817577 17821092 Melanie, l"m so tired.<br />l"ve got to go home.
17821337 17823293 Aren"t you tired, Melanie?
17823497 17826330 No, l"m not tired, Scarlett.
17826577 17829887 This might be Ashley...
17830137 17832935 ...and only strangers here<br />to comfort him.
17833137 17835492 No, l"m not tired, Scarlett.
17836297 17838094 They could all be...
17838337 17840089 ...Ashley.
17851257 17854932 l"ve been waiting one solid hour<br />to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes.
17855177 17857850 Go on, you trash. Don"t be<br />pestering these ladies.
17858097 17860406 - Don"t talk to her.<br />- It"s all right.
17860617 17861493 Who are you?
17861697 17862925 l"m Belle Watling.
17863177 17866328 But that don"t matter.<br />You think I got no business here.
17866577 17868772 Tell me what you<br />want to see me about.
17869017 17872214 First time I come here, I says,<br />Belle, you"re a nurse.
17872457 17876336 They didn"t want my kind of nursing.<br />They was more than likely right.
17876577 17880695 Then I tried giving them money.<br />My money wasn"t good enough either!
17880897 17882216 The old peahens!
17882457 17884971 I know a gentleman who says<br />you"re a human being.
17885177 17888533 If you are, which they ain"t, you"ll<br />take my money for the hospital.
17888777 17891530 What are you doing here?<br />Haven"t you been told twice?
17891777 17893688 l"m conversing with Mrs. Wilkes!
17893897 17897731 You might as well take my money.<br />It"s good money, even if it is mine.
17897977 17902334 - L"m sure you"re very generous.<br />- L"m a Confederate, like everybody else.
17902577 17904010 Of course you are!
17904257 17906213 Some folks here wouldn"t feel that way.
17906457 17909494 But maybe they ain"t<br />as good Christians as you.
17915897 17918616 Look, Mrs. Meade,<br />it"s a great deal of money.
17918857 17921087 10, 20, 30, 50!
17921297 17923731 And it"s not our<br />paper money, it"s gold!
17923977 17925854 Let me see that handkerchief.
17926057 17926967 R.B.!
17929457 17932893 And she"s driving away<br />in Rhett Butler"s carriage!
17933577 17937092 If I just wasn"t a lady, what<br />wouldn"t I tell that varmint!
17969697 17972495 The Lord is my shepherd,<br />I shall not want.
17972777 17976087 He maketh me to lie down<br />in green pastures.
17978977 17980933 He restoreth my soul.
17981177 17984886 He leadeth me in the paths of<br />righteousness for His name"s sake.
17985097 17988328 Yea, though I walk through<br />the valley of the shadow of death...
17988577 17991694 ...I will fear no evil,<br />for Thou art with me.
17991937 17994656 Thy rod and Thy staff,<br />they comfort me.
17995177 17996610 The Yankees!
17996857 17999735 Yankees! Dr. Meade,<br />they"re getting closer.
17999977 18004095 They"ll never get into Atlanta.<br />Never get through old Peg Leg Hood.
18005297 18006935 Give me something for the pain!
18007857 18009210 Give me something for the pain!
18009457 18012290 Sorry, son, we haven"t<br />got anything to give you.
18013577 18016296 These animals is driving me crazy!
18017497 18019328 What luck! You got my jack.
18019577 18021886 Give me an ace<br />and l"ll start another war.
18022097 18023894 And l"ll bid the moon.
18026497 18031412 ...that I never see you<br />and my Pa again.
18032377 18033810 This leg"s got to come off.
18034057 18036173 No, don"t! Leave me alone!
18036417 18037486 l"m sorry, soldier.
18037697 18040894 - We"re all out of chloroform.<br />- We"ll operate without it.
18041177 18043737 No, no, you won"t!<br />You can"t do it.
18043977 18045092 I won"t let you do it!
18045297 18048209 Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off.<br />It"s gangrene.
18050497 18052931 I haven"t seen my family in three days.
18053177 18055133 l"m going home for half an hour.
18055377 18056969 Orderly, give me a lift!
18060897 18063491 Nurse, you can free this bed.
18063897 18065489 Miss Scarlett!
18067057 18068490 Why, Frank Kennedy.
18068697 18070733 Miss Suellen. Is she well?
18070977 18073935 When did they bring you in?<br />Are you bad hurt?
18074177 18076486 - Suellen. Is she...?<br />- She"s all right.
18076697 18080895 Dr. Wilson needs you in the operating<br />room. He"s gonna take off that leg.
18082697 18084096 l"ll be back.
18085377 18089734 No! You leave me alone! Don"t!
18089977 18091490 I can"t stand it!
18092777 18096133 Don"t cut! Don"t cut!
18096377 18099733 Don"t! Don"t! Please!
18099977 18101490 Where"s the nurse?
18105337 18106531 Dr. Wilson"s waiting.
18106777 18108893 Let him wait! L"m going home!
18109137 18112686 I don"t want any more men dying and<br />screaming. I don"t want any more!
18171377 18172332 Big Sam!
18173377 18174253 Big Sam!
18176377 18178572 Almighty Moses!<br />lt"s Miss Scarlett!
18181497 18184694 Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle.<br />l"m so glad to see you.
18184937 18187326 Tell me about my mother.<br />She didn"t write me.
18187537 18189209 - She gone got sick.<br />- Sick?
18189457 18191413 Just a little bit sick, that"s all.
18191657 18194410 Your pa went wild when<br />they wouldn"t let him fight.
18194657 18198127 He had fits when they took us<br />to dig the ditch for the soldiers.
18198377 18201767 Your ma said the Confederacy needs it.<br />We"s digging for the South.
18202017 18204087 - Was there a doctor?<br />- We"ve got to march.
18204337 18206532 Don"t worry, we"ll stop them Yankees.
18206777 18208290 Goodbye, Big Sam.
18208497 18210294 If you get sick or hurt,<br />let me know.
18210497 18211896 Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
18239697 18243690 Climb into this buggy. This is no<br />day for walking. You"ll get run over!
18244537 18246368 Drive me to Aunt Pitty"s, please.
18248177 18250293 Panic"s a pretty sight, isn"t it?
18253177 18256772 Just another of Sherman"s calling<br />cards. He"ll pay us a visit soon.
18257017 18259611 I gotta get out of here<br />before the Yankees come!
18259857 18261336 Leave your hospital work?
18261577 18265172 Or have you had enough of death<br />and lice and men chopped up?
18265417 18267487 I suppose you weren"t meant<br />for sick men.
18267737 18271696 Don"t talk like that. L"m so scared!<br />I wish I could get out of here.
18271897 18273091 Let"s get out together.
18273337 18276135 No use letting the South<br />come down around your ears.
18276377 18278891 There are too many nice<br />places to go and visit.
18279137 18281856 - Mexico, London, Paris...<br />- With you?
18282097 18283246 Yes, ma"am.
18283457 18286608 With a man who understands and<br />admires you for what you are.
18286857 18289735 I figure we belong together,<br />being the same sort.
18289977 18294334 l"ve been waiting for you to grow up<br />and get Ashley out of your heart.
18294537 18298689 Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to<br />have a baby in another month or so.
18298897 18302936 It"ll be hard loving a man with<br />a wife and baby clinging to him.
18304977 18308890 Well, here we are. Are you going<br />with me or are you getting out?
18309137 18310729 I hate and despise you.
18310977 18313286 l"ll hate and despise you till I die!
18314737 18317695 Oh, no, you won"t, Scarlett.<br />Not that long.
18324577 18325805 Miss Scarlett!
18326057 18329527 Folks is all going to Macon,<br />and folks is running away!
18329777 18332894 I can"t bear those cannonballs<br />right in my ears!
18333097 18335292 I faint every time I hear one.
18336097 18338292 Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.
18338497 18340727 - You aren"t leaving?<br />- I may be a coward...
18340977 18345812 ...but oh, dear! Yankees in Georgia!<br />How did they ever get in?
18346057 18348525 l"m going too.<br />Prissy, go pack my things.
18348777 18350176 Wait, I won"t be a minute.
18350377 18352686 Do you really think you ought to?
18353377 18356130 What is this?<br />You ain"t planning on running away?
18356377 18359414 Don"t try to stop me.<br />l"m never going back to that hospital.
18359657 18362330 l"ve had enough of smelling death,<br />of rot and death.
18362577 18365774 l"m going home! I want my mother.<br />My mother needs me.
18366017 18368087 Listen to me!<br />You must stay here.
18368337 18370931 Without a chaperon?<br />It simply isn"t...
18371177 18373737 Good heavens, this is war,<br />not a garden party!
18373977 18376491 - Melanie needs you.<br />- Oh, bother Melanie!
18376697 18379734 She"s ill already. She shouldn"t<br />even be having a baby.
18379977 18381535 Can"t we take her along?
18381777 18386214 Want her to be jounced over rough<br />roads and have the baby ahead of time?
18386457 18388925 It isn"t my baby.<br />You take care of her!
18389177 18392294 We haven"t enough doctors<br />to look after a sick woman.
18392537 18393731 You"ve got to stay.
18393977 18396616 I don"t know anything<br />about babies being born.
18396857 18399530 I knows! I knows!<br />I knows how to do it.
18399777 18402575 l"s done it lots and lots.<br />Let me, doctor. Let me.
18402777 18406929 - I can do everything.<br />- Good. L"ll rely on you to help us.
18407137 18410129 Ashley"s fighting in the field.<br />Fighting for the Cause.
18410377 18413130 He may never come back.<br />He may die.
18413377 18416687 Scarlett, we owe him<br />a well-born child.
18417577 18419932 If you"re coming, Scarlett, hurry!
18420177 18422896 I promised Ashley something...
18423097 18424689 Then you"ll stay?
18424937 18427895 Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.<br />Scarlett"s staying.
18428137 18429092 Go on, Uncle Peter.
18429337 18430736 I don"t know what to do.
18431257 18434135 It"s like the end of the world!
18434377 18437449 Uncle Peter, my smelling salt!
18444177 18446532 Melanie, Melanie!<br />lt"s all your fault!
18446777 18448608 I hate you! I hate you!
18448817 18450296 And I hate your baby!
18450577 18455093 If only I hadn"t promised Ashley.<br />If only I hadn"t promised him!
18482937 18485770 Stop! Stop! Please, stop.
18486017 18487086 Are the Yankees coming?
18487297 18488776 The army"s pulling out.
18489017 18491008 Pulling out and<br />leaving us to the Yankees?
18491257 18495489 Not leaving, evacuating. Before<br />Sherman cuts the McDonough road.
18495737 18497295 It can"t be true!
18497497 18498566 What"ll I do?
18498817 18502287 Better refugee south, right quick.<br />If you"ll excuse me.
18505497 18509934 Prissy! Go pack my things and<br />Melanie"s too. We"re going to Tara.
18510337 18512293 The Yankees are coming!
18517257 18518895 Melly, we"re going to...
18524697 18528690 l"m sorry to be<br />such a bother, Scarlett.
18530337 18532726 It began at daybreak.
18535177 18537327 But the Yankees are coming.
18538337 18540009 Poor Scarlett.
18540257 18544045 You"d be at Tara now with<br />your mother, wouldn"t you?
18544257 18545736 If it weren"t for me.
18546497 18550285 Oh, Scarlett, darling.<br />You"ve been so good to me.
18550537 18553688 No sister could have been sweeter.
18555777 18558291 l"ve been lying here thinking...
18558777 18560893 ...if I should die...
18561577 18564091 ...will you take my baby?
18565697 18567528 Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
18567777 18570530 Aren"t things bad enough without<br />you talking about dying?
18570777 18573575 - L"ll send for Dr. Meade.<br />- Not yet, Scarlett.
18573777 18576496 I couldn"t let Dr. Meade<br />sit here for hours...
18577177 18580487 ...while all those poor, wounded boys...
18583057 18584536 Come here, quick!
18584737 18587092 Go get Dr. Meade.<br />Run! Quick!
18587337 18588611 The baby.
18588857 18591735 Don"t stand there like<br />a scared goat. Run!
18593497 18596136 Hurry, hurry!<br />l"ll sell you south, I will.
18596377 18597776 I swear I will!
18598977 18600888 Where"s that Prissy?
18603457 18607689 This room"s like an oven already<br />and it isn"t noon yet.
18610177 18612293 Don"t worry, Melly.
18612497 18616285 Mother says it always seems<br />like the doctor will never come.
18617097 18619895 If I don"t take a strap to that Prissy!
18628537 18630926 Know what I heard<br />about Maybelle Merriwether?
18631177 18633133 You remember her<br />funny-looking beau?
18633377 18636335 The one with the uniform like<br />ladies" red flannels?
18636577 18639933 You don"t have to keep on<br />talking for my sake.
18640177 18642896 I know how worried you are.
18646337 18650455 <i>For to tote the weary load</i>
18650657 18653217 <i>No matter, 'twill never... </i>
18656257 18658896 l"ll just go and fetch you<br />some cooler water.
18659897 18662616 You"re slow as molasses in January.<br />Where"s Dr. Meade?
18662857 18665052 - I never seen him, Miss Scarlett.<br />- What?
18665257 18667327 He ain"t at the hospital.
18667577 18670569 A man told me that the doctor"s<br />down at the car shed...
18670777 18672335 ...with the wounded soldiers...
18672577 18674727 Well, why didn"t you go after him?
18674977 18679334 Miss Scarlett, l"s scared to go<br />down there at the car shed.
18679577 18684492 There"s folks dying down there.<br />And l"s scared of dead folks!
18685137 18686490 Go sit by Miss Melly.
18686977 18690287 And don"t you be upsetting her<br />or l"ll whip the hide off you.
18693537 18695687 <i>Just a few more days</i>
18695897 18699128 <i>For to tote the weary load</i>
18726977 18729696 - Have you seen...?<br />- Move aside, lady, please.
18733177 18734895 Dr. Meade?
18777377 18778332 Dr. Meade, at last!
18778937 18781849 Thank heaven you"re here.<br />I need every pair of hands.
18782377 18785289 Now, come, child, wake up.<br />We got work to do.
18785537 18788415 But Melly"s having her baby.<br />You"ve got to come with me!
18788977 18791571 Are you crazy? I can"t<br />leave these men for a baby.
18791777 18794291 They"re dying! Hundreds!<br />Get a woman to help.
18794537 18797495 But there isn"t anybody.<br />Dr. Meade, she might die.
18797737 18801412 Die? Look at them, bleeding<br />to death in front of my eyes!
18801657 18803807 No chloroform. No bandages.<br />Nothing!
18804057 18805570 Nothing to ease their pain.
18805817 18807728 Run along and don"t bother me.
18808377 18811335 Don"t worry, child.<br />There"s nothing to bringing a baby.
18811657 18813887 - Bring the stretchers in here.<br />- Dr. Meade?
18814097 18815894 Yeah, l"m coming.
18834057 18835888 Is the doctor come?
18836137 18837411 No, he can"t come.
18837657 18840125 Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.
18840377 18842891 He can"t come.<br />There"s nobody to come.
18843577 18846808 You"ve got to manage without<br />the doctor. L"ll help you.
18847057 18849207 Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett!
18849977 18851012 Well, what is it?
18851257 18853293 Lordy, we"s got to have a doctor!
18853497 18856489 I don"t know nothing<br />about birthing babies!
18857457 18859129 - What do you mean?<br />- I don"t know...
18859337 18860895 You told me you<br />knew everything!
18861137 18862809 I don"t know why I lied!
18863057 18866493 Ma ain"t never let me around<br />when folks was having them.
18871097 18872371 Miss Scarlett!
18872777 18874688 Stop it!
18875337 18878090 Light a fire on the stove.<br />Boil water in the kettle.
18878297 18881846 Get me a ball of twine,<br />clean towels and the scissors.
18882057 18886096 Don"t tell me you can"t find them!<br />Go get them and get them quick!
18897257 18898895 Coming, Melly.
18899777 18901290 Coming!
18904257 18906532 You better go before<br />the Yankees get here.
18906777 18908335 You know I won"t leave you.
18908577 18910135 It"s no use. L"m gonna die.
18910377 18912333 Don"t be a goose, Melly.<br />Hold on to me.
18912577 18915489 - Hold on to me!<br />- Talk to me, Scarlett.
18915697 18917927 Please, talk to me.
18918177 18921214 Don"t try to be brave. Yell!<br />There"s nobody to hear.
18921457 18926326 Ma says that if you puts a knife under<br />the bed, it cuts the pain in two.
18930977 18932888 Captain Butler!
18933377 18935095 Captain Butler!
18936537 18938289 - Who do you want?<br />- Captain Butler.
18938497 18941011 He"s upstairs.<br />Belle Watling"s giving a party.
18941257 18942690 Yes, sir.
18943257 18944246 Thank you.
18946577 18947692 Captain Butler!
18949177 18951088 What"s all the rumpus about?
18951297 18954334 l"s got a message for Captain Butler,<br />Mrs. Watling.
18954577 18957887 Captain Butler, you come out here<br />in the streets to me!
18959377 18962813 - What is it, Prissy?<br />- Miss Scarlett done sent me for you.
18963057 18966288 Miss Melly, she done had<br />her baby today.
18966497 18968886 A fine baby boy.
18969137 18971651 And Miss Scarlett and me, we brung it.
18971897 18973296 Are you telling me Scarlett...?
18973537 18975607 It was mostly me, Captain Butler.
18975857 18978325 Only Miss Scarlett, she<br />helped me a little.
18978577 18981694 But I don"t expect no doctor<br />could have done no better.
18981937 18986488 Only, Miss Melly, she feel kind<br />of poorly now it"s all over.
18987057 18988285 Yes, I can believe that.
18988537 18992291 And the Yankees is coming.<br />And Miss Scarlett, she says...
18993377 18995766 Captain Butler, the Yankees is here!
18995977 18999492 Please come and bring your<br />carriage for us right away!
18999737 19002456 l"m sorry, but the army<br />took my horse and carriage.
19002697 19004369 You better come upstairs.
19004617 19005811 No, Captain Butler.
19006457 19011372 Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk<br />if I was to go into Mrs. Watling"s.
19011857 19015691 Any of you beauties know where I can<br />steal a horse for a good cause?
19024177 19027135 - Is that you, Rhett?<br />- We"s here, Miss Scarlett!
19027377 19028207 I knew you"d come.
19028457 19031130 Nice weather we"re having.<br />Prissy tells me you"re...
19031377 19033971 If you make any jokes now,<br />l"ll kill you!
19034217 19036447 - You"re frightened?<br />- L"m scared to death!
19036657 19039046 If you had sense,<br />you"d be scared too.
19039257 19041327 - The Yankees!<br />- No, not yet.
19041537 19044529 That"s what"s left of our army<br />blowing up the ammunition.
19044777 19046733 We gotta get out of here!
19046977 19048933 At your service.<br />Where are you going?
19049177 19052692 - Home, to Tara.<br />- They"ve been fighting around Tara.
19052897 19057334 You"re going to parade through there<br />with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie?
19057537 19058811 Do you intend leaving them?
19059057 19061287 They"re going with me,<br />and you can"t stop me!
19061537 19064927 It"s dangerous jouncing<br />Mrs. Wilkes over open country.
19065177 19067088 I want my mother!
19067657 19069488 I want to go home to Tara!
19069777 19072928 Tara"s probably been burned.<br />The woods are full of stragglers.
19073177 19075008 The least they"ll do<br />is take the horse.
19075257 19077725 It"s not much, but I had<br />trouble stealing it.
19077977 19081094 l"m going home if I have to<br />walk every step of the way!
19081337 19084886 l"ll kill you if you try<br />to stop me! I will, I will!
19091537 19095086 All right, darling, all right.<br />Now you shall go home.
19096577 19100490 I guess anybody who did what you"ve<br />done today can take care of Sherman.
19102737 19104295 Stop crying.
19106257 19109886 Now blow your nose like<br />a good little girl. There.
19120977 19123252 - What"s going on?<br />- L"m packing!
19123457 19126290 Well, stop it<br />and come and get the baby!
19132297 19134447 - We"re taking you to Tara.<br />- Tara?
19134657 19136170 It"s the only way.
19136377 19139175 They"ll burn the house<br />over our heads if we stay.
19139377 19140605 It"s all right, Melly.
19140857 19142734 My baby.
19142977 19145013 My poor baby.
19148977 19152890 - Can you put your arms around my neck?<br />- I think so.
19155657 19157090 Never mind.
19157497 19159135 Ashley, Charles!
19159337 19160531 What"s she want?
19160777 19163211 Ashley"s picture and Charles" sword.
19163457 19164890 Get them.
19180337 19181326 What"s that?
19181577 19184330 Our gallant lads set fire<br />to the warehouses.
19184577 19187011 Enough ammunition in boxcars<br />to blow us to Tara.
19187257 19189725 - We have to get across the tracks.<br />- Not that way!
19189977 19193686 We have to. McDonough road"s the<br />only one the Yankees haven"t cut yet.
19202777 19205211 Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!
19205457 19209086 - What are you laughing at?<br />- At you, locking the Yankees out.
19224777 19226415 Oh, dear!<br />I wish they"d hurry.
19226657 19229091 I wouldn"t be in such a hurry<br />to see them go.
19229337 19232488 With them goes the last<br />semblance of law and order.
19233937 19235893 Scavengers aren"t wasting any time.
19240377 19242015 Better get out of here fast.
19242257 19244293 There"s a horse! Get it!
19245897 19247489 Give us that horse!
19254137 19255650 Down the alley! Cut him off!
19259537 19260333 Pull that horse!
19264177 19265690 l"ll get him!
19269177 19270132 Give me that horse!
19286337 19287929 Haven"t left much to take.
19288177 19291533 We"ll make a dash for it before<br />the fire reaches that ammunition.
19311977 19312887 Come on!
19317297 19318525 Throw me your shawl.
19321377 19324016 You"ll like it better<br />if you don"t see anything.
19381777 19384894 Take a good look, my dear.<br />It"s a historic moment.
19385097 19389295 Tell your grandchildren how you watched<br />the Old South disappear one night.
19405457 19409416 They were gonna lick the Yankees<br />in a month. The poor gallant fools.
19409657 19410726 They make me sick.
19410977 19414094 Getting us all into this<br />by swaggering and boasting.
19414297 19417892 That"s the way I felt once about<br />their swaggering and boasting.
19418377 19420493 l"m so glad you aren"t with the army.
19420737 19424491 You can be proud. Proud that you"ve<br />been smarter than all of them.
19427137 19429093 l"m not so proud.
19447097 19447893 Why did you stop?
19448097 19450975 This is the turn to Tara.<br />Let the horse breathe a bit.
19452297 19455494 Miss Melly done fainted<br />way back, Captain Butler.
19455697 19459895 She"s better off. She couldn"t<br />stand the pain if she were conscious.
19460577 19464092 Scarlett, are you still determined<br />to do this crazy thing?
19464337 19466089 I know we can get through, Rhett.
19466297 19469209 Not we, my dear, you.<br />l"m leaving you here.
19469977 19472491 You"re what?<br />Rhett, where are you going?
19472737 19475695 - L"m going to join the army.<br />- You"re joking.
19475937 19479168 - I could kill you for scaring me so.<br />- L"m very serious.
19479377 19481811 l"m going to join up<br />with our brave lads in gray.
19482057 19483695 But they"re running away.
19483937 19487725 They"ll turn and make a last stand.<br />When they do, l"ll be with them.
19487977 19491492 - L"m a little late, but better late...<br />- You must be joking!
19492257 19493690 Selfish to the end, aren"t you?
19493937 19497293 Thinking of your own hide,<br />never a thought for the Cause.
19497497 19498930 How could you do this to me?
19499177 19503932 And why should you go now that<br />it"s all over, and I need you? Why?
19504177 19508170 l"ve always had a weakness for lost<br />causes, once they"re really lost.
19508417 19509532 Or maybe...
19510737 19513092 ...maybe l"m ashamed of myself.
19513897 19514727 Who knows?
19514937 19517735 You should die of shame to<br />leave me alone and helpless!
19517977 19519695 You? Helpless?
19520377 19523096 Heaven help the Yankees<br />if they capture you.
19523537 19525289 Now climb down here.
19525497 19527294 I want to say goodbye.
19528377 19530095 Climb down!
19532897 19534376 Rhett, please don"t go!
19534577 19537614 You can"t leave me, please.<br />l"ll never forgive you!
19537857 19541532 l"m not asking you to forgive me.<br />l"ll never forgive myself.
19541777 19545690 If a bullet gets me, l"ll laugh<br />at myself for being an idiot.
19546137 19549686 There"s one thing I do know, and<br />that is I love you, Scarlett.
19549897 19553890 In spite of you and me and the world<br />going to pieces, I love you.
19554097 19556611 Because we"re alike.<br />Bad lots, both of us.
19556857 19561772 Selfish and shrewd, but able to look<br />things in the eye and call them by name.
19562137 19564014 Don"t hold me like that!
19565497 19566896 Look at me.
19567137 19569412 I love you more than<br />l"ve loved any woman.
19569657 19572410 And l"ve waited longer<br />for you than any woman.
19572737 19574489 Let me alone!
19575057 19578732 A soldier of the South loves you.<br />Wants your arms around him.
19578977 19581571 Wants to carry the memory<br />of your kisses into battle.
19581777 19583335 Never mind about loving me.
19583577 19587286 You"re a woman sending a soldier<br />to his death with a beautiful memory.
19587497 19589931 Scarlett, kiss me.
19590177 19592486 Kiss me once.
19596657 19599091 You low-down, cowardly,<br />nasty thing, you!
19599337 19603296 They were right. Everybody was right.<br />You aren"t a gentleman.
19605577 19608296 A minor point at such a moment.
19609457 19612972 Here. If anyone lays a hand<br />on that nag, shoot him.
19613177 19615088 Don"t shoot the nag by mistake.
19615337 19617453 Go on! I want you to go.
19617657 19620490 I hope a cannonball blows you<br />into a million pieces...!
19620697 19623814 Never mind the rest.<br />I follow your general idea.
19624057 19628573 And when l"m dead on the altar of my<br />country, I hope your conscience irks you.
19628777 19631086 Goodbye, Scarlett.
19655177 19658692 Come on, you. We"re going home.
19730297 19733095 Oh, my poor baby.
19734057 19737447 Don"t worry. Mother will<br />take care of him when we get home.
19737697 19740450 Miss Scarlett, l"s powerful hungry.
19740657 19743854 - We"s got to have something to eat.<br />- Hush up!
19744057 19747367 We"re nearly at Twelve Oaks.<br />We"ll stop there.
19747617 19749096 Go on!
19810777 19812495 Oh, Ashley.
19813177 19816294 Ashley, l"m glad you"re<br />not here to see this.
19816977 19821095 The Yankees. The dirty Yankees!
19836017 19837291 Come tie up this cow.
19837697 19839847 We don"t need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
19840097 19843169 We"ll be home soon,<br />and l"s scared of cows.
19843497 19846534 Tie her onto the back of the wagon<br />with your petticoat.
19846777 19851214 We need milk for the baby, and we<br />don"t know what we"ll find at home.
19860057 19861092 Melly, we"re home!
19861337 19864613 We"re at Tara. Hurry!<br />Move, you brute!
19866657 19868056 It"s dead!
19868297 19870811 I can"t see the house.<br />Is it there?
19871057 19872092 Have they burned it?
19876097 19880010 It"s all right! Lt"s all right!<br />They haven"t burned it.
19880257 19881815 It"s still there!
19885057 19888208 Mother! Mother, l"m home!
19890097 19892611 Mother! Mother, l"m home!
19897177 19900214 Mother, let me in.<br />It"s me. Scarlett!
19906097 19907815 Oh, Pa!
19908217 19909809 l"m home.
19910897 19912615 l"m home.
19915057 19916410 Katie?
19917057 19919252 Katie Scarlett!
19919457 19922017 Oh, darlin"!
19931857 19933210 Mammy!
19934057 19935854 Mammy, l"m home.
19936097 19938008 Honey child...
19939497 19941215 Mammy, l"m so...
19942497 19943566 Where"s mother?
19944577 19946010 Why...
19946217 19949892 ...Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,<br />they was sick with the typhoid.
19950297 19953130 They had it bad, but they"s<br />doing all right now.
19953377 19956528 - Just weak, like little kittens.<br />- But where"s mother?
19960017 19963646 Miss Ellen. She went down to<br />nurse that Emmie Slattery...
19963897 19967606 ...that white trash, and she<br />took down with it too.
19969577 19971010 Then last night, she...
19971217 19972411 Mother?
19975377 19976810 Mother?
20041657 20042851 Miss Scarlett, honey.
20043097 20046009 If there"s anything I can do,<br />Miss Scarlett...
20046657 20050366 - What did you do with Melly?<br />- Don"t worry your pretty head.
20050577 20053250 I done slapped her in bed,<br />along with the baby.
20053497 20055806 You better put that cow into the barn.
20056057 20057888 There ain"t no barn no more.
20058137 20062016 - The Yankees burned it for firewood.<br />- The house was their headquarters.
20062257 20063690 They camped all around.
20063897 20065250 Yankees in Tara?
20065497 20068057 They stole most everything<br />they didn"t burn.
20068297 20072848 All the clothes and all the rugs,<br />and even Miss Ellen"s rosaries.
20074297 20076094 l"m starving.<br />Get me something to eat.
20076297 20079209 There ain"t nothing to eat, honey.<br />They took it all.
20079697 20081096 All the chickens? Everything?
20081337 20082850 They took them first.
20083097 20085691 What they didn"t eat,<br />they carried off.
20085937 20088610 Don"t tell me any more about<br />what they did!
20103777 20105210 What"s this, Pa?
20105697 20109007 - Whiskey?<br />- Yes, daughter.
20112497 20114249 Katie Scarlett, that"s enough.
20114497 20117455 Your not knowing spirits,<br />you"ll make yourself tipsy.
