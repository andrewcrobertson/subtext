165106 167199 My back's near broken.
169611 171340 Look at my hands.
172047 175483 Mother said you could always tell a lady<br />by her hands.
175684 179745 I guess things like hands and ladies<br />don't matter so much anymore.
180488 184424 You rest, Sue. You're not well yet,<br />and I can pick cotton for both of us.
184492 188121 Scarlett's hateful, making us work<br />in the fields like...
188196 189925 Too bad about that.
190265 193359 Now get back to work.<br />I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.
193435 196165 What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!
199374 202309 Don't you ever dare say<br />you hate Tara again!
203111 205602 It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.
212320 215084 Katie Scarlett, there's something<br />I must speak to you about.
215156 216214 Yes, Pa, what is it?
216291 220159 I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.<br />I don't like the way you're treating them.
220228 223720 You must be firm with inferiors,<br />but you must be gentle with them...
223798 225231 especially darkies.
225300 229168 Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them<br />to do anything I'm not doing myself.
229237 233571 Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it.<br />I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
248223 250316 What are you doing out of bed, Melly?
250391 253588 Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.<br />You are all working so hard.
253661 255356 I can't lie in bed doing nothing.
255430 257955 Go on back upstairs.<br />You're as weak as a newborn colt.
258032 259294 Please, Scarlett, let me.
259367 261665 Stop being noble.<br />I've got enough on my hands...
261736 264637 without you making yourself sick<br />so you'll never be any use.
264706 267231 Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
322931 325525 Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot.
331840 333774 You're alone, little lady?
336611 338977 You ain't very friendly, are you?
341983 344781 You got anything else<br />besides these earbobs?
344853 347378 You Yankees have been here before.
347555 350183 Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
351226 353694 What have you got hidden in your hand?
389330 391298 Scarlett, you killed him.
392467 394332 I'm glad you killed him.
395503 399462 Scarlett, what happened?<br />What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
403311 406542 Don't be scared, chickens.<br />Your big sister was cleaning a revolver...
406614 409174 and it went off<br />and nearly scared her to death.
409250 412378 Oh, thank goodness.<br />Haven't we got enough to frighten us?
412553 415113 Tell Katie Scarlett<br />she must be more careful.
418326 420624 What a cool liar you are, Melly.
421262 423526 We've got to get him out of here<br />and bury him.
423598 425623 If the Yankees find him here, they'll...
425700 428760 I didn't see anyone else.<br />I think he must be a deserter.
428836 430463 But even so, we've got to hide him.
430538 434304 They might hear about it,<br />and then they'd come and get you.
437211 439839 I could bury him in the arbor<br />where the ground is soft...
439914 442382 but how will I get him out of here?
443017 444644 We'll both take a leg and drag him.
444719 446482 You couldn't drag a cat.
453294 456627 Do you think it would be dishonest<br />if we went through his haversack?
456698 459166 I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
459233 462066 You take the haversack,<br />I'll search his pockets.
474282 475544 You look.
475950 477713 I'm feeling a little weak.
477785 480379 Melly, I think it's full of money!
481222 482814 Oh, Melly, look!
482890 484016 Look!
484625 485717 $10, $20, $30, $40...
485793 487920 Don't stop to count it now.<br />We haven't got time.
487996 490487 Do you realize this means<br />we'll have something to eat?
490565 492396 Look in his other pockets.
494435 495868 Hurry, hurry!
496070 498436 - We've got to get him out of here.<br />- Here.
511719 514620 If he bleeds across the yard,<br />we can't hide it.
514689 517658 Give me your nightgown, Melly.<br />I'll wad it around his head.
517725 519317 Don't be silly. I won't look at you.
519394 522727 If I had my petticoat or pantalets,<br />I'd use them.
536310 538608 Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
539614 542139 Now go back to bed.<br />You'll be dead if you don't.
542216 544878 I'll clean up the mess<br />when I've buried him.
544952 547113 No, I'll clean it up.
550491 552789 Well, I guess I've done murder.
554362 556489 I won't think about that now.
556564 558828 I'll think about that tomorrow.
568142 569666 Katie Scarlett!
570611 572135 Katie Scarlett!
572413 574244 It's over! It's over!
575316 577181 It's all over! The war!
577251 578775 Lee surrendered.
578853 581447 - It's not possible.<br />- Why did we ever fight?
581522 583581 Ashley will be coming home.
583658 585888 Yes, Ashley will be coming home.
585960 587587 We'll plant more cotton.
587662 589630 Cotton ought to go sky-high next year!
606948 609178 <i>While we were marching through Georgia</i>
609250 610581 <i>Hurrah, hurrah!</i>
610651 612050 <i>We bring the jubilee</i>
612120 613644 <i>Hurrah, hurrah!</i>
613721 615586 <i>The flag that makes you free</i>
615656 618625 <i>So we sing the chorus<br />from Atlanta to the sea</i>
618826 621556 <i>While we were marching through Georgia</i>
622630 624723 Get out of the road, rebel!<br />Get out of the way!
624799 627097 Have you room in your carriage<br />for a dying man?
627168 629830 I got no room for any Southern scum,<br />alive or dead.
629904 631303 Get out of the way.
631372 633897 I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.
633975 636603 Giddap! Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
636744 638644 Act like they won the war!
639313 642043 Now you come on and give me<br />them pants, Mr. Kennedy.
642116 643174 Come on.
645453 648980 You scrub yourself with that strong<br />lye soap before I scrubs you myself.
649056 652116 I'm gonna put these britches<br />in the boiling pot.
654829 657263 The whole Confederate Army's got<br />the same trouble:
657331 659390 Crawling clothes and dysentery.
660301 662201 It's humiliating,<br />how you treat Mr. Kennedy.
662270 666536 You'd be a sight more humiliated<br />if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you!
668142 669507 Come on, Beau.
669577 673843 We must leave this gentleman alone<br />because he's tired and he's hungry.
674248 677115 I don't mind, ma'am.<br />Good to see a youngster again.
677185 678584 Nice little fellow.
678653 682384 Another two years of war and we could<br />have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.
683257 684747 Were you in Cobb's Legion?
684825 686122 Yes, ma'am.
686194 689425 Why, then, you must know my husband,<br />Maj. Wilkes.
689497 690964 Oh, yes, ma'am.
691032 693500 He was captured at Spotsylvania, I think.
693568 694796 Captured!
695670 697934 Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't...
698005 700667 Oh, my poor Ashley in a Yankee prison!
700741 701969 Melanie.
702076 704840 Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.<br />Come along, Beau.
704912 707244 I'll watch out for him, ma'am.<br />We're good friends.
707315 708805 Oh, thank you.
713221 716679 I slave day and night so we can have<br />food to keep body and soul together.
716757 719225 And you give it all away<br />to these starving scarecrows.
719293 721261 I'd sooner have a plague of locusts here.
721329 723263 Don't scold me, Scarlett, please.
723331 726095 I've just heard<br />that Ashley was taken prisoner.
726167 727862 - Ashley, a prisoner?<br />- Yes.
727935 732133 And maybe if he's alive and well,<br />he's on some Northern road right now.
732506 735737 And maybe some Northern woman<br />is giving him a share of her dinner...
735810 738870 and helping my beloved<br />to come back home to me.
740815 741975 I hope so, Melly.
742049 743209 Miss Scarlett.
746921 750357 Miss Scarlett, I want to take up<br />something with your pa, but...
750424 751516 he doesn't seem to...
751592 754186 Perhaps I can help you.<br />I'm head of the house now.
754262 755923 Well, I...
756497 759557 Miss Scarlett, I was aiming<br />to ask for Suellen.
760167 762465 Do you mean to tell me<br />you haven't asked for her...
762536 764731 after all these years<br />she's been counting on you?
764805 768571 Well, the truth is,<br />I'm so much older than she is, and...
768709 770904 Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.
770978 772605 Who has nowadays?
772780 775715 Miss Scarlett, if true love<br />carries any weight with you...
775783 778411 you can be sure your sister<br />will be rich in that.
778486 782115 I'll go out somewhere and get myself<br />a little business if we're engaged.
782189 783747 As soon as I get on my feet again...
783824 786258 All right, Frank. I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
786327 788056 You go ask her now.
788596 790928 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
794168 796193 Excuse me, excuse me.
798939 801908 Scarlett, what seems to be<br />the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
801976 803910 More trouble than he guesses.
803978 805878 He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.
805946 807538 Oh, I'm so glad.
807615 812211 It's a pity he can't marry her now.<br />At least there'd be one less mouth to feed.
815656 817180 Oh, another one.
817758 819089 I hope this one isn't hungry.
819160 820252 He'll be hungry.
820328 823161 I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate...
834608 835802 Ashley!
837945 839207 Ashley!
840915 842143 Darling!
852293 854989 Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.
855062 857963 Turn me loose, you fool!<br />Turn me loose, it's Ashley!
858032 860125 He's her husband, ain't he?
872346 874541 - Miss Scarlett, ma'am.<br />- High time you got back.
874615 877448 - Did you get the horse shod?<br />- Yes, he shod all right.
877518 881318 Fine thing when a horse can get shoes<br />and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.
881389 883482 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
883557 886958 I gotta know how much money<br />have you got left, in gold.
887194 888889 $10. Why?
889964 891192 That won't be enough.
891265 893460 What in heaven's name are you<br />talking about?
893534 897766 Well, Miss Scarlett, I seed that old<br />no-count white-trash Wilkerson...
897838 900534 that used to be Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
900608 904009 He's a regular Yankee now,<br />and he was making a brag...
904278 909215 that his carpetbagger friends done run<br />the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
909350 911215 But how much more have we got to pay?
911285 914345 I hear the taxman say $300.
914422 915753 $300!
917224 919454 Might just as well be $3 million.
919527 921324 But we gotta raise it, that's all.
921395 922589 Yes, ma'am.
922663 923687 How?
926100 927431 I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
927501 929833 Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.
929904 932702 Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?
934775 936367 Asking ain't getting.
945753 946947 Ashley!
948222 951487 They say Abe Lincoln got his start<br />splitting rails.
951659 954127 Think what heights I may climb to<br />once I get the knack.
955563 958031 The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
959834 961426 What shall we do?
962136 964468 Ashley, what's to become of us?
964738 968230 What becomes of people<br />when their civilization breaks up?
968309 971278 Those who have brains and courage<br />come through all right.
971345 973006 Those that haven't are winnowed out.
973080 976379 For heaven's sake,<br />don't stand there talking nonsense at me...
976450 978315 when it's us who are being winnowed out.
978385 980114 You're right, Scarlett.
980187 983213 Here I am talking tommyrot<br />about civilization...
983290 985383 when your Tara's in danger.
985559 988926 You've come to me for help,<br />and I've no help to give you.
988996 990657 Oh, Scarlett, I...
990731 992221 I'm a coward.
993000 994865 You, Ashley, a coward?
995636 997433 What are you afraid of?
997505 1000997 Oh, mostly of life becoming<br />too real for me, I suppose.
1002176 1004542 Not that I mind splitting rails...
1004979 1009348 but I do mind very much<br />losing the beauty of that life I loved.
1011485 1015979 If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent<br />my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
1016590 1018490 But the war did come.
1018726 1021388 I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
1021462 1024522 I saw men crumple up in agony<br />when I shot them.
1025232 1029293 And now I find myself in a world<br />which for me is worse than death.
1030070 1032868 A world in which there's no place for me.
1034542 1038444 I can never make you understand because<br />you don't know the meaning of fear.
1038512 1040946 You never mind facing realities...
1041749 1044616 and you never want<br />to escape from them as I do.
1047254 1048448 Escape?
1049790 1051553 Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.
1051959 1053893 I do want to escape, too.
1054228 1058324 I'm so very tired of it all.<br />I've struggled for food and for money.
1058399 1062802 I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton<br />until I can't stand it another minute.
1062870 1065361 I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.<br />It's dead.
1065439 1070172 The Yankees and the carpetbaggers<br />have got it and there's nothing left for us.
1071579 1072876 Oh, Ashley...
1073714 1075341 let's run away.
1075416 1076610 We'd go to Mexico.
1076684 1079881 They want officers in the Mexican Army.<br />We could be so happy there.
1079954 1083754 I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.<br />You know you don't love Melanie.
1083824 1086019 You told me you loved me<br />that day at Twelve Oaks.
1086093 1088027 And anyway, Melanie can't...
1088095 1091861 Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have<br />any more children and I could give you...
1091932 1093957 Can't we ever forget<br />that day at Twelve Oaks?
1094034 1096798 Do you think I could ever forget it?<br />Have you forgotten it?
1096870 1099566 Can you honestly say you don't love me?
1100574 1102940 - No. I don't love you.<br />- It's a lie!
1103043 1107104 Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie<br />and the baby, break Melanie's heart?
1107181 1109172 You couldn't leave<br />your father and the girls.
1109249 1111979 I could leave them. I'm sick of them.<br />I'm tired of them.
1112052 1115954 Yes, you're sick and tired.<br />That's why you're talking this way.
1116624 1118819 You've carried the load for all of us...
1118892 1122191 but from now on I'm going to be<br />more help to you, I promise.
1122262 1124355 There's only one way you can help me.
1124431 1125898 Take me away.
1126066 1128398 There's nothing to keep us here.
1129370 1130632 Nothing.
1132339 1134136 Nothing except honor.
1146754 1148483 Oh, please, Scarlett.
1148555 1150785 Please, dear, you mustn't cry.
1150991 1152049 You mustn't.
1152126 1154924 Please, my brave dear, you mustn't.
1167908 1170172 You do love me, you do love me.
1170244 1172508 - Say it, say it.<br />- Don't, don't.
1172579 1173978 You love me, you love me.
1174048 1176608 We won't do this, I tell you.<br />It won't happen again.
1176684 1178777 I'm going to take Melanie<br />and the baby, and go.
1178852 1180183 Say it, you love me.
1180254 1183883 All right, I'll say it. I love your courage<br />and your stubbornness.
1183957 1187723 So much that I could have forgotten<br />the best wife a man ever had.
1187795 1190696 But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.
1199907 1202341 Then there's nothing left for me.
1203343 1205402 Nothing to fight for.
1206246 1208180 Nothing to live for.
1210884 1212852 Yes, there is something.
1213787 1216312 Something you love better than me...
1216590 1218683 though you may not know it.
1224431 1225557 Tara!
1229336 1230894 Yes, I...
1232673 1234334 I still have this.
1239346 1240870 You needn't go.
1241548 1245882 I won't have you all starve simply<br />because I threw myself at your head.
1246487 1248352 It won't happen again.
1275849 1278340 - Why, it's Emmy Slattery.<br />- Yes, ma'am, it's me.
1278418 1279510 Stop!
1280154 1283055 You haven't forgotten your old overseer,<br />have you?
1283891 1285791 Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
1285859 1288828 Get off those steps, you trashy wench!<br />Get off this land!
1288896 1290727 You can't speak that way to my wife.
1290798 1293358 Wife! High time you made her your wife.
1293433 1296129 Who baptized your other brats<br />after you killed my mother?
1296203 1300765 We came out here to pay a friendly call<br />and talk a little business with old friends.
1300841 1303776 Friends! When were we ever friends<br />with the likes of you?
1303844 1307075 Still high and mighty, ain't you?<br />Well, I know all about you.
1307147 1308842 I know your father's turned idiot.
1308916 1310406 You can't pay your taxes.
1310484 1313044 And I come here<br />to offer to buy the place from you...
1313120 1314849 to make you a right good offer.
1314922 1316514 Emmy's had a hankering to live here.
1316590 1318353 Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.
1318425 1321792 You high-flying Irish will find out<br />who's running things around here...
1321862 1323523 when you get sold out for taxes.
1323597 1326532 I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel<br />and I'll live in it.
1326600 1329000 But I'll wait for the Sheriff's sale.
1329069 1331560 That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
1332773 1334764 You'll be sorry for that.
1343283 1344580 We'll be back!
1344651 1347347 I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.
1352693 1354183 Pa, come back!
1357331 1358491 Pa, come back!
1358565 1359589 Pa!
1361268 1362758 Yankee coward!
1370711 1371735 Pa!
1392232 1395326 Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.<br />That's Mr. Gerald's watch.
1395602 1398765 You take it. It's for you.<br />Pa'd want you to have it.
1398839 1402172 You ain't got no business parting<br />from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.
1402242 1405678 You needs all your valuables<br />to sell for that tax money.
1405846 1408246 You think I'd sell Pa's watch?
1409516 1411040 And don't cry.
1411752 1414516 I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
1418191 1419886 Oh, Mammy, Mammy.
1425799 1430202 You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett,<br />you just gotta go on being brave.
1430404 1432395 Think about your pa like he used to be.
1432472 1434303 I can't think about Pa.
1434541 1436668 I can't think of anything but that $300.
1436743 1438904 Ain't no good thinking about that,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1438979 1440742 Ain't nobody got that much money.
1441748 1445309 Nobody but Yankees and scalawags<br />got that much money now.
1447487 1448545 Rhett!
1448622 1450351 Who that? A Yankee?
1455529 1458430 Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and...
1459299 1461164 I haven't any clothes.
1470777 1473905 Scoot up to the attic and get down<br />Ma's old box of dress patterns.
1473981 1475778 What you up to with Miss Ellen's portiere?
1475849 1476941 You'll make me a new dress.
1477017 1479850 Not with Miss Ellen's portieres.<br />Not while I got breath in me.
1479920 1482514 Great balls of fire!<br />They're my portieres now.
1482589 1486150 I'm going to Atlanta for that $300<br />and I've got to go looking like a queen.
1486226 1488421 - Who going to Atlanta with you?<br />- I'm going alone.
1488495 1490895 That's what you think.<br />I's going to Atlanta with you.
1490964 1492522 With you and that new dress.
1492599 1493623 Now, Mammy, darling.
1493700 1495691 No use to try to sweet-talk me,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1495769 1498465 I's knowed you since I put<br />the first pair of diapers on you.
1498538 1501132 I said I's going to Atlanta with you,<br />and going I is.
1501775 1504938 Kings and treys, huh?<br />Too good for me, Major!
1505345 1508178 Pity we couldn't have fought the war out<br />in a poker game.
1508248 1511274 You'd have done better than Gen. Grant<br />with far less effort.
1511351 1512477 What is it, Corporal?
1512552 1516283 Sir, there's a lady to see Capt. Butler.<br />Says she's his sister.
1516356 1517880 Another sister?
1518225 1520591 This is a jail, not a harem, Capt. Butler.
1520660 1522491 No, Major, she ain't one of those.
1522562 1525030 This one's got her mammy with her.
1525265 1526425 She has?
1527534 1530799 I'd like to see this one, Major,<br />without her mammy.
1532305 1535604 Let's see, my losses for the afternoon<br />come to what?
1537577 1539169 $340.
1539246 1541976 My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?
1542182 1543410 All right, Corporal.
1543483 1546350 Show Capt. Butler's sister to his cell.
1547220 1549950 Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen.
1554528 1558123 It's hard to be strict with a man<br />who loses money so pleasantly.
1560200 1562498 - Rhett!<br />- Scarlett!
1562969 1565062 My dear little sister.
1566640 1570804 It's all right, Corporal.<br />My sister has brought me no files or saws.
1576149 1577343 Can I really kiss you now?
1577417 1579544 On the forehead like a good brother.
1579619 1582315 No, thanks.<br />I'll wait and hope for better things.
1583123 1586149 Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed<br />when I heard you were in jail.
1586289 1588382 I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.
1588458 1590449 It's not true they're going to hang you?
1590527 1591687 Would you be sorry?
1591794 1593625 - Oh, Rhett!<br />- Well, don't worry yet.
1593696 1595664 They have plotted<br />some charge against me...
1595732 1597427 but they're really after my money.
1597500 1599832 They think I made off<br />with the Confederate Treasury.
1599903 1601393 Well, did you?
1601571 1603129 What a leading question.
1603206 1605697 But let's not talk<br />about sordid things like money.
1605775 1609006 How good of you to come and see me.<br />And how pretty you look.
1609078 1612047 Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,<br />teasing a country girl like me.
1612115 1615380 Thank heavens you're not in rags.<br />I'm tired of seeing women in rags.
1615451 1616850 Turn around.
1617487 1620012 You look good enough to eat.<br />And prosperous, too.
1620089 1621920 Thank you, I've been doing very well.
1621991 1623788 Everybody's doing well at Tara, only...
1623860 1627421 I got so bored I just thought<br />I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
1627497 1630227 You're a heartless creature.<br />But that's part of your charm.
1630300 1632564 You know you've got more charm<br />than the law allows.
1632635 1635195 Now I didn't come here<br />to talk silliness about me, Rhett.
1635271 1638365 I came because I was so miserable<br />at the thought of you in trouble.
1638441 1641308 I was mad at you the night you left me<br />on the road to Tara...
1641377 1642901 and I still haven't forgiven you.
1642979 1644571 Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.
1644647 1648344 Well, I must admit<br />I might not be alive now, only for you.
1648718 1652449 And when I think of myself<br />with everything I could possibly hope for...
1652522 1656390 and not a care in the world,<br />and you here in this horrid jail...
1656893 1659862 and not even a human jail, Rhett,<br />a horse jail.
1661297 1663857 Oh, listen to me<br />trying to make jokes when...
1663933 1665992 when I really want to cry.
1666135 1668103 In a minute I shall cry.
1671207 1674040 Scarlett, can it be possible that...
1674744 1676712 Can what be possible, Rhett?
1676779 1680271 That you've grown a woman's heart,<br />a real woman's heart?
1680516 1682643 I have, Rhett. I know I have.
1685455 1689255 You know, it's worth being in jail<br />just to hear you say that.
1690560 1692289 It's well worth it.
1696799 1699267 You can drop the moonlight<br />and magnolias, Scarlett.
1699335 1701735 So things have been going well<br />at Tara, have they?
1701804 1703328 What have you done with your hands?
1703406 1705306 I went riding last week without my gloves.
1705375 1708776 These don't belong to a lady.<br />You've worked with them like a field hand.
1708845 1710676 Why did you lie? What are you up to?
1710747 1713443 In another minute, I'd almost believe<br />you cared something.
1713516 1714608 But I do care.
1714684 1716083 Suppose we get down to the truth.
1716152 1717915 You want something from me<br />badly enough...
1717987 1720387 to put on quite a show in your velvets.
1720456 1721855 What is it? Money?
1722992 1725586 I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
1725862 1728592 I did lie to you<br />when I said everything was all right.
1728665 1732658 Things are just as bad as they possibly<br />could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.
1733636 1735501 What collateral are you offering?
1735605 1737197 - My earbobs.<br />- Not interested.
1737273 1739468 - A mortgage on Tara.<br />- What would I do with a farm?
1739542 1742340 You wouldn't lose.<br />I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.
1742412 1745176 Not good enough.<br />Have you nothing better?
1747016 1749143 You once said you loved me.
1749519 1751714 If you still love me, Rhett...
1751788 1754985 You haven't forgotten<br />that I'm not a marrying man?
1755058 1757356 No, I haven't forgotten.
1763032 1764897 You're not worth $300.
1765501 1768368 You'll never mean anything<br />but misery to any man.
1768438 1769496 Go on, insult me.
1769572 1771733 I don't care what you say,<br />only give me the money.
1771808 1775574 I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go<br />while there's a breath left in my body.
1775812 1776870 Oh, Rhett.
1777180 1779307 Won't you please give me the money?
1779482 1781848 I couldn't give you the money<br />if I wanted to.
1781918 1784011 My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.
1784087 1787921 If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd<br />be on me like a duck on a June bug.
1788091 1791060 So you see, my dear,<br />you've abased yourself to no purpose.
1794297 1796094 Here, here, here, stop it!
1796866 1798993 Want the Yankees to see you like this?
1799068 1800899 Take your hands off me, you skunk.
1801003 1803267 You knew what I was going to say<br />before I started.
1803339 1806604 You knew you wouldn't lend me<br />the money and yet you let me go on.
1806676 1808473 I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.
1808544 1811945 Cheer up. You can come to my hanging<br />and I'll remember you in my will.
1812014 1814881 I'll come to your hanging.<br />The only thing I'm afraid of...
1814951 1818045 is that they won't hang you in time<br />to pay the taxes on Tara.
1824660 1826321 Tell him Belle Watling.
1826396 1829229 Where you been lately?<br />Thought you'd deserted Capt. Butler.
1829298 1831994 Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out.
1841043 1844638 Who that? I ain't never seen hair<br />that color before in my life.
1844981 1846812 Does you know a dyed-haired woman?
1846883 1849545 I wish I did know that one.<br />She'd get my money for me.
1851754 1854154 No matter what they done to you<br />in that jail...
1854223 1856020 they didn't do no more than you deserve...
1856092 1858151 for visiting white trash in a jail!
1864967 1866161 Fresh and green.
1866235 1867395 Right off the farm.
1867470 1869529 Hey, what are you doing tonight, Susy?
1869605 1871266 That's one of them Georgia peaches.
1871340 1873365 There's nothing like that in Ohio.
1873443 1876037 - You know what we're going to do?<br />- What?
1876112 1879138 We're going to give every last one of you<br />40 acres and a mule!
1879215 1881649 - And a mule?<br />- Forty acres and a mule!
1881751 1882877 Gee!
1882952 1884715 'Cause we're your friends...
1884787 1886687 and you're gonna become voters...
1886756 1889020 and you're gonna vote like your friends do!
1890860 1892259 What's your hurry, sister?
1892328 1893727 What's come over this here town?
1893796 1897698 Yankees have come over it!<br />Same as they've come over all of us.
1899502 1901402 Out of our way, trash!
1901604 1902798 Get out of the way here.
1902872 1904430 Get away! Go on!
1912548 1913947 Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!
1914016 1916450 - Why, Frank Kennedy!<br />- And Mammy!
1916519 1918282 It sure is good to see home folks.
1918354 1919878 I didn't know you were in Atlanta.
1919956 1921389 I didn't know you were.
1921457 1923925 Didn't Miss Suellen tell you<br />about my store?
1923993 1926894 Did she? I don't remember.<br />Have you a store?
1927063 1928121 This?
1928197 1930461 Won't you come in and look around a bit?
1938875 1941469 I don't suppose it looks like much<br />to a lady, but...
1941544 1943409 I can't help being proud of it.
1944080 1945377 You're not making money?
1945448 1948645 Well, I can't complain.<br />In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
1949151 1951711 Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
1951787 1954915 It won't be long now<br />before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
1954991 1956549 Are you doing as well as all that?
1956626 1958423 Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.
1958494 1960325 I'm no millionaire yet...
1960396 1962762 but I've cleared $1,000 already.
1963065 1964157 And lumber, too.
1964233 1965325 Well...
1966035 1967332 that's only a sideline.
1967403 1968870 A sideline, Frank?
1969038 1972974 With all the good Georgia pine around<br />Atlanta and all this building going on?
1973042 1976011 Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...
1976546 1978673 and I've got to be thinking<br />about buying a home.
1978748 1980272 What do you want a home for?
1980349 1982977 For Miss Suellen and me<br />to set up housekeeping.
1983052 1986385 Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her<br />to Atlanta, wouldn't you?
1987256 1990191 There wouldn't be much help<br />in that for Tara.
1990593 1993528 I don't rightly know what you mean,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1993596 1994858 I don't mean a thing.
1994931 1998492 Frank, how'd you like to drive me out<br />to my Aunt Pitty's?
1999068 2001400 Nothing would give me<br />more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.
2001470 2003165 You'd better stay to supper, too.
2003239 2006800 I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable<br />and I'd like a good long visit with you.
2006876 2009504 Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,<br />Miss Scarlett.
2010580 2012810 And will you tell me all the news...
2012882 2015077 all the news of Miss Suellen?
2017486 2019317 What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?
2019388 2020912 Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
2020990 2022355 Oh, no, no.
2022692 2024660 I thought surely she had written you.
2024727 2026388 I guess she was ashamed to write you.
2026462 2028054 She should be ashamed.
2028130 2030758 Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.
2030833 2034530 You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
2035004 2038804 Well, she's going to marry<br />one of the county boys next month.
2039575 2043204 She just got tired of waiting<br />and was afraid she'd be an old maid...
2043279 2046009 Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
2046682 2049378 Oh, it's cold. I left my muff at home.
2049619 2052486 Would you mind<br />if I put my hand in your pocket?
2068871 2071931 But, Melanie, you don't realize<br />what she's done.
2072008 2074408 She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.
2074477 2076604 He's my beau,<br />and she's gone and married him.
2076679 2078909 She did it to save Tara,<br />you must understand that.
2078981 2080243 I hate Tara!
2080316 2084377 And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing<br />I hate worse than Tara.
2088190 2089851 It's all my fault.
2090760 2094059 I should have committed highway robbery<br />to get that tax money for you.
2094130 2096496 I couldn't let you<br />do anything like that, and...
2096766 2098256 Well, anyway, it's done now.
2098334 2100097 Yes, it's done now.
2100603 2102696 You wouldn't let me<br />do anything dishonorable...
2102772 2106299 but you'd sell yourself in marriage<br />to a man you didn't love.
2106375 2110573 Well, at least you won't have to worry<br />about my helplessness anymore.
2110913 2112403 What do you mean?
2112481 2114381 I'm going to New York.
2115384 2117511 I've arranged to get a position<br />in a bank there.
2117586 2119451 But you can't do that.
2121023 2124220 I counted on you to help me start<br />a lumber business, Ashley...
2124293 2126158 and, well, I counted on you.
2126228 2127490 I wouldn't be any good to you.
2127563 2129656 I don't know anything<br />about the lumber business.
2129732 2132223 You know as much as you do<br />about banking.
2132301 2135202 And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.
2135271 2137671 That's generous of you, Scarlett.
2138240 2139901 But it isn't that.
2139975 2143103 If I go to Atlanta<br />and take help from you again...
2143179 2145670 I'd bury forever any hope<br />of standing alone.
2145748 2147238 Oh, is that all?
2147316 2151377 Well, you could gradually buy the business<br />and then it would be your own, and...
2152722 2154019 No, Scarlett.
2157626 2158820 Ashley...
2166669 2167897 Ashley.
2175344 2176709 Scarlett!
2178247 2179612 Scarlett, what is it?
2179682 2181877 Ashley's so mean and hateful.
2182084 2183847 What have you done?
2186055 2187784 She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
2187857 2192055 To help me start my lumber business, and<br />he won't lift a finger to help me, and he...
2192128 2194062 Why, how unchivalrous of you.
2194130 2196121 Why, think, Ashley, think.
2196332 2199529 If it hadn't been for Scarlett,<br />I'd have died in Atlanta.
2199602 2202400 And maybe we wouldn't have had<br />little Beau...
2202471 2205907 and when I think of her picking cotton<br />and plowing just to keep food...
2205975 2207704 in our mouths, I could just...
2207777 2209301 Oh, my darling.
2213883 2215612 All right, Melanie.
2215751 2217480 I'll go to Atlanta.
2218821 2220755 I can't fight you both.
2240009 2243035 Well, here's your new mill hands,<br />Mrs. Kennedy.
2243112 2245979 The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
2246482 2248643 They look pretty thin and weak to me,<br />Gallagher.
2248717 2249877 Halt!
2252188 2253849 They're the best you can lease, ma'am.
2253923 2256756 And if you'll just give Johnny Gallagher<br />a free hand...
2256826 2259158 you'll get what you want out of them.
2259228 2261196 All right, you're the foreman.
2261263 2264994 All I ask is, you keep the mill running<br />and deliver my lumber when I want it.
2265067 2266625 Johnny Gallagher's your man, miss.
2266702 2267999 But remember...
2268070 2270538 no questions and no interference.
2270606 2273302 That's a bargain.<br />Start them in the morning, Gallagher.
2273375 2275707 Come on, get a move on!<br />Come on, move on there!
2275778 2278303 But, Scarlett, this isn't right<br />and you know it.
2278380 2280905 It's bad enough for a woman<br />to be in business, but...
2280983 2282280 What are you complaining about?
2282351 2284649 You wouldn't have owned a mill<br />had I not taken over.
2284720 2287314 I didn't want the mill,<br />and we couldn't have bought it...
2287389 2290552 if you hadn't pressed all of our friends<br />for the money they owed me.
2290626 2291752 Isn't that right, Ashley?
2291827 2293920 What, are you running<br />a charitable institution?
2293996 2296624 Go back to the store,<br />then go home and take your medicine.
2296699 2297893 You're not looking very well.
2297967 2300026 But, sugar, shouldn't you come home<br />with me?
2300102 2303469 Great balls of fire. Don't bother me<br />anymore, and don't call me sugar!
2303539 2305370 All right, all right.
2305908 2307398 Good night, Ashley.
2309478 2312276 She can get mad quicker<br />than any woman I ever saw.
2313816 2315943 Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...
2316018 2319283 I do wish you'd let me hire free darkies<br />instead of using convicts.
2319355 2320788 I believe we could do better.
2320856 2324019 Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,<br />and convicts are dirt-cheap.
2324093 2325754 If we just give Gallagher a free hand...
2325828 2329195 A free hand! You know what that means.<br />He'll starve them and whip them.
2329265 2331233 Some of them are sick, underfed...
2331300 2332892 Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.
2332968 2335994 Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken<br />three times a day and...
2336071 2338232 tucking them to sleep<br />with eiderdown quilts.
2338307 2342038 I will not make money out<br />of the enforced labor and misery of others.
2342111 2344136 You weren't so particular<br />about owning slaves.
2344213 2346647 That was different.<br />We didn't treat them that way.
2346715 2349047 Besides, I'd have freed them all<br />when father died...
2349118 2351348 if the war hadn't already freed them.
2351420 2352717 Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
2353055 2355353 But have you forgotten<br />what it's like without money?
2355424 2358484 I found out that money is<br />the most important thing in the world...
2358560 2360721 and I don't intend ever to be<br />without it again.
2360796 2363788 I'll make enough so the Yankees<br />can never take Tara away from me.
2363866 2365458 I'll make it the only way I know how.
2365534 2368025 But we're not the only Southerners<br />who have suffered.
2368103 2371869 Look at all our friends. They're keeping<br />their honor and their kindness, too.
2371941 2375604 And they're starving. I've got no use<br />for fools who won't help themselves.
2375678 2378112 I know what they're saying about me,<br />and I don't care.
2378180 2380205 I'll make friends<br />with Yankee carpetbaggers.
2380282 2383217 I'll beat them at their own game,<br />and you'll beat them with me.
2385621 2388613 That's it. Move it a little over to that side.
2388991 2390549 Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
2390626 2391615 Good afternoon.
2391694 2393457 Business is certainly growing, ain't it?
2393529 2394655 It certainly is.
2396065 2399034 But you're doing business<br />with the same people who robbed us...
2399101 2401661 and tortured us and left us to starve.
2401737 2402897 All that's past, Melly.
2402972 2406464 And I intend to make the best of things,<br />even if they are Yankee things.
2409144 2412545 And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,<br />that Dr. Meade actually saw her...
2412614 2414980 peddling lumber to those Yankees herself.
2415050 2416074 And that isn't all...
2416151 2419018 I think it's shocking what she's doing<br />to my brother Ashley.
2419088 2421613 She's even taken<br />to driving her own buggy.
2429431 2431126 My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
2431200 2432929 My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.
2433268 2435259 I don't see how you have<br />the gall to face me.
2435337 2437328 When I think you could have had<br />my millions...
2437406 2438930 if you'd just waited a little while.
2439008 2440976 Oh, how fickle is woman!
2441143 2443543 What is it you want?<br />I have important things to do.
2443612 2447810 Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point<br />which has bothered me for some time?
2447883 2449510 Well, what is it? Be quick.
2449585 2453419 Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink<br />from marrying men you don't love?
2453956 2457483 How did you ever get out of jail?<br />Why didn't they hang you?
2457559 2459254 Oh, that! Not much trouble.
2459328 2461193 There's nothing much<br />that money won't buy.
2461263 2464699 I observe it's even bought you<br />the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
2464767 2466826 So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
2466902 2468893 Do you know,<br />I believe you're jealous of him.
2468971 2471599 You still think<br />you're the belle of the county, don't you?
2471673 2474005 That you're the cutest little trick<br />in shoe leather.
2474076 2476203 Every man you meet<br />is dying of love for you.
2476278 2477609 Let me by!
2478013 2481107 Don't be angry, Scarlett.<br />Tell me, where are you going?
2481183 2483048 To the mill, if it's any of your business.
2483118 2484380 Through shantytown, alone?
2484453 2488184 Haven't you been told it's dangerous<br />to drive alone through all that riffraff?
2488257 2489690 Don't worry about me.
2489758 2493023 I can shoot straight<br />if I don't have to shoot too far.
2500135 2501568 What a woman!
2536538 2538096 Could you give me a quarter?
2538173 2539538 Let go of my horse!
2541844 2543471 Hold this horse!
2554022 2555080 Help!
2555624 2557023 Help!
2558627 2559719 Help!
2593962 2595259 Miss Scarlett!
2614316 2616807 Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!
2617252 2618776 Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!
2618854 2619878 Big Sam!
2620222 2622053 Miss Scarlett! Wait!
2624226 2625625 Sam! Sam!
2626094 2629086 Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br />Did they hurt you?
2629998 2633695 Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.<br />Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.
2634636 2636263 Horse, make tracks!
2639675 2642269 You get to Tara just as quick as you can<br />and stay there.
2642344 2644972 I sure will.<br />I got enough of them carpetbaggers.
2645047 2647208 Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br />Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
2647282 2648909 Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.
2648984 2652420 Scarlett, change your dress and go over<br />to Miss Melly's for the evening.
2652487 2654352 I've got to go to a political meeting.
2654423 2655515 A political meeting!
2655591 2657320 How can you go to a political meeting...
2657392 2659451 after what I've been through<br />this afternoon?
2659528 2662122 Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.
2662197 2666258 Nobody cares about me.<br />You all act as though it was nothing at all.
2688056 2690957 The men talk, talk, talk<br />about protecting our women...
2691026 2695588 and after what happened to me today<br />Frank has to go to a political meeting.
2699001 2701731 And if it won't pain you too much,<br />India Wilkes...
2701803 2704704 I'd be much obliged<br />if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.
2704773 2706331 Has my face gone green or something?
2706408 2707670 It won't pain me!
2707743 2710268 What happened this afternoon<br />was just what you deserved!
2710345 2712745 If there was any justice,<br />you'd have gotten worse.
2712814 2713803 India, hush up!
2713882 2715509 Let her talk. She's always hated me!
2715584 2717677 Ever since I took your brother<br />away from her...
2717753 2719948 though she's too much of a hypocrite<br />to admit it!
2720022 2721614 If she thought anyone'd go for her...
2721690 2723123 she'd walk down the street naked!
2723191 2724749 I do hate you!
2725627 2728858 You've done all you could<br />to lower the prestige of decent people.
2728930 2731660 Now you've endangered the lives<br />of our men, because they...
2731733 2732859 India!
2732934 2736734 I don't think we'd better say any more,<br />or one of us will be saying too much.
2736805 2739467 What's going on around here<br />that I don't know about?
2745314 2747111 Somebody's coming up the walk.
2747182 2749480 Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
2749818 2752912 Will you hand me the pistol, please,<br />Mrs. Meade?
2758760 2760352 Whoever it is...
2761163 2762960 we know nothing.
2765867 2766993 Where have they gone?
2767102 2769593 You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />It's life or death!
2769671 2771901 Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.
2771973 2774203 Quickly, please! There may still be time.
2774276 2775265 How did you know?
2775344 2777278 I was playing poker<br />with two Yankee captains.
2777346 2778677 They knew there'd be trouble.
2778747 2780112 They've sent their cavalry out.
2780182 2782514 Your husband and his friends<br />are walking into a trap.
2782584 2785348 Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!
2787889 2790517 At the Decatur Road.<br />The old Sullivan plantation.
2790592 2792890 The house is burned.<br />They're meeting in the cellar.
2792961 2794690 I'll do what I can.
2799101 2801968 What's all this about?<br />If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!
2802037 2803629 We thought it best not to tell you.
2803705 2806902 Ashley, Frank and the others<br />have gone to clean out those woods...
2806975 2808033 where you were attacked.
2808110 2810078 A great many Southern gentlemen have...
2810145 2811737 done this lately for our protection.
2811813 2815044 And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,<br />Scarlett!
2815117 2816379 And it will be your fault!
2816451 2818646 Another word,<br />and you go out of this house, India!
2818720 2820711 Scarlett did what she thought<br />she had to do.
2820789 2824156 And our men are doing<br />what they think they have to do.
2824226 2825420 Frank!
2826061 2827426 And Ashley!
2829631 2831496 Oh, it isn't possible!
2834803 2837328 There's horses, Miss Melly.<br />Here they come.
2837406 2839340 You're sewing, you're sewing.
2843912 2845709 Open the door, Mammy.
2855424 2857517 Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
2859561 2861256 Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?
2861329 2862956 I am Mrs. Wilkes.
2863265 2865699 I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,<br />if you please.
2865767 2867029 He's not here.
2867102 2868091 Are you sure?
2868170 2870297 Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.
2870372 2872840 I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
2872908 2875376 If you'll give me your word,<br />I won't search the house.
2875444 2879471 Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at<br />a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
2879548 2882415 He's not at the store,<br />and there's no meeting tonight!
2882484 2884145 No political meeting.
2884219 2887416 We'll wait outside<br />till he and his friends return.
2888190 2891250 Sergeant, surround the house.<br />Put a man on each door and window.
2891326 2892588 Yes, sir!
2896998 2899398 Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
2899734 2902032 And I'll read aloud.
2905540 2909203 "The Personal History and Experience<br />of David Copperfield.
2911713 2913203 "Chapter one.
2913281 2914578 "I am born.
2918954 2922720 "To begin my life with the beginning<br />of my life, I record that I was born.
2923658 2926218 "Chapter Nine.<br />I have a memorable birthday.
2926294 2928319 "I pass over all that happened at school...
2928396 2931593 "until the anniversary of my birthday<br />came around in March.
2932701 2935397 "Except that Steerforth was more to be<br />admired than ever...
2935470 2936732 "I remember nothing.
2936805 2939899 "He was going away at the end<br />of the half-year, if not sooner...
2940008 2943341 "and was more spirited and independent<br />than before in my eyes...
2943778 2946212 "and therefore more engaging<br />than before; but...
2946281 2948181 "beyond this I remember nothing.
2949050 2950278 "The great...
2952654 2953780 "I remember nothing. "
2958827 2960522 Melly! They're drunk!
2961229 2962958 Leave this to me, Scarlett.
2963031 2964828 And please, say nothing.
2968270 2970170 You stupid fool!
2971973 2973099 Quiet!
2973742 2976142 Will you shut up for the love of...
2976211 2977405 Hello, Melly.
2977479 2980880 So you've got my husband<br />intoxicated again, Capt. Butler!
2980949 2981973 Well, bring him in.
2982050 2984416 I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />Your husband's under arrest.
2984486 2986716 If you arrest all the men<br />who get intoxicated...
2986788 2989382 you must have<br />a good many Yankees in jail.
2989457 2992915 Bring him in, Capt. Butler.<br />If you can walk yourself.
2994095 2995562 I want to tell you a story...
2995630 2997257 Listen, Doctor, I...
2997332 2999459 Put him there in that chair.
3002437 3005099 And now, Capt. Butler,<br />will you please leave my house...
3005173 3007767 and try to remember<br />not to come here again?
3008076 3010874 Well, now, that's fine thanks I get<br />for bringing him home...
3010946 3013813 and not leaving him on the streets<br />in this shameful condition!
3013882 3015509 Now, boys, all together!
3015951 3017475 Dr. Meade...
3018086 3019951 I'm astonished at you!
3026728 3029356 Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?
3030799 3032994 I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
3033368 3036269 Take him into the bedroom<br />and lay him out on the bed as usual.
3036338 3037930 Don't touch him, he's under arrest!
3038006 3039030 Now, Tom.
3039107 3040904 What do you want to arrest him for?
3041242 3042903 I've seen him drunker.
3043144 3045738 I've seen you drunker!<br />And you've seen me...
3045814 3049113 He can lie in the gutter for all I care!<br />I'm not a policeman.
3049184 3051277 But he led a raid tonight<br />on that shantytown...
3051353 3054151 where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble<br />this afternoon.
3054222 3057248 A lot of those shanties were burned.<br />A couple of men were killed.
3057325 3061386 It's about time you rebels learned you<br />can't take the law into your own hands.
3061463 3063431 What are you laughing at?
3064699 3067532 This isn't your night<br />to teach that lesson, Tom.
3067602 3070469 These two have been<br />with me tonight. Yes, sir.
3070739 3072366 With you, Rhett?
3072941 3074135 Where?
3078113 3080946 I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
3081016 3082643 You'd better say.
3082751 3084878 Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
3084953 3086147 Speak out, Capt. Butler!
3086221 3089713 I think I have a right to know<br />where my husband's been.
3091126 3094391 Well, ma'am, we dropped in<br />on a friend of mine...
3095664 3097325 and the Captain's.
3097432 3099263 A Mrs. Belle Watling.
3099868 3102962 We played cards, drank champagne and...
3103738 3105035 well...
3105106 3108542 Now you've done it! Did you have to<br />show me up in front of my wife?
3110145 3112113 Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.
3112180 3115513 These ladies won't be on speaking terms<br />with their husbands tomorrow.
3116951 3118976 Rhett, I had no idea, I...
3120255 3124214 Look here, will you take an oath<br />that they were with you tonight at...
3124292 3125418 at Belle's?
3125827 3128762 Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.<br />She'll tell you, Captain.
3128830 3131264 Will you give me your word<br />as a gentleman?
3131332 3132765 As a gentleman?
3132834 3134597 Why, certainly, Tom.
3136805 3138102 Well, if I...
3138173 3140300 if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
3141409 3144344 I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I...
3145480 3147573 If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.
3147649 3150243 Well, I say I'm sorry, and...
3151386 3153013 well, I am sorry.
3153088 3154783 Come on, Sergeant.
3161062 3163656 Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
3165233 3166325 Ashley.
3166401 3168926 He's all right. It's only in the shoulder.
3169003 3171369 Get him on the bed<br />where I can dress the wound.
3171439 3172872 I think I can walk.
3173908 3175967 It's not worth the effort. Which way?
3176044 3177102 In here.
3178780 3180748 - Mammy, I want some hot water.<br />- Yes, sir.
3180815 3182612 - And lint for bandages.<br />- I'll find some.
3182684 3185312 Now what can I use for a probe?<br />If I only had my bag.
3185386 3188048 Were you really there?<br />What did it look like?
3188690 3192786 Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br />plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
3192861 3195728 Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br />remember yourself.
3197732 3201395 Now, Capt. Butler,<br />tell me what happened, all that happened.
3201469 3202834 I was too late.
3202904 3204769 When I got to the old Sullivan place...
3204873 3207034 there'd already been a skirmish<br />with the Yankees.
3207108 3210202 I found Mr. Wilkes wounded<br />and Dr. Meade was with him.
3210278 3213577 I had to prove they had been somewhere,<br />anyplace but where they were.
3214649 3216310 So I took them to Belle's.
3216384 3217976 And she took them in?
3218052 3220714 She's by way of being<br />an old friend of mine.
3220789 3222780 Oh, I'm sorry. I...
3222857 3226190 I'm sorry I couldn't think up<br />a more dignified alibi.
3229130 3233089 This isn't the first time you've come<br />between me and disaster, Capt. Butler.
3233168 3236660 It isn't likely that I'd question<br />any device of yours.
3238206 3241471 And now I'll go and see<br />what Dr. Meade needs.
3247182 3248547 Oh, Ashley!
3250351 3251443 Ashley!
3253488 3257447 Have you no interest in what's become<br />of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?
3259761 3262195 Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
3262263 3263355 No.
3263965 3265626 Well, where is he?
3266034 3268434 He's lying out on Decatur Road...
3268903 3270768 shot through the head.
3271539 3272904 He's dead.
3282917 3284179 Who is it?
3284352 3285751 It's Miss Watling.
3285820 3288687 Oh, Miss Watling!<br />Won't you come in the house?
3288756 3291486 Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.
3291960 3294520 You come in and sit a minute with me.
3302036 3304504 How can I thank you enough<br />for what you did for us?
3304572 3306335 How can any of us thank you enough?
3306407 3309535 I got your note saying you was going<br />to call on me and thank me.
3309611 3312341 Why, Miss Wilkes,<br />you must have lost your mind.
3312413 3314938 I come up here as soon<br />as it was dark to tell you...
3315016 3317280 you mustn't even think of any such thing.
3317352 3318717 Why, I'm...
3319287 3320754 Why, you're...
3320822 3322619 Well, it wouldn't be fitting at all.
3322690 3326717 It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind<br />woman who saved my husband's life?
3326794 3331163 Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady<br />in this town nice to me like you was.
3331933 3334731 I mean, about the money<br />for the hospital, you know.
3334802 3336531 And I don't forget a kindness.
3336604 3339971 And I got to thinking about you<br />being left a widow with a little boy...
3340041 3341736 if Mr. Wilkes got hung...
3342343 3345676 and he's a nice little boy,<br />your boy is, Miss Wilkes.
3345980 3348505 I got a boy myself and so I...
3349117 3351312 Oh, you have? Does he live...
3351386 3354116 Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.
3354856 3356756 He ain't never been here.
3356824 3358758 He's off at school.
3359227 3361855 I ain't seen him since he was little.
3364265 3368497 Well, anyway, if it had been<br />that Miss Kennedy's husband by himself...
3368569 3372005 I wouldn't have lifted a finger,<br />no matter what Capt. Butler said.
3372073 3374007 She's a mighty cold woman.
3374075 3376236 Prancing about Atlanta by herself.
3376711 3379578 She killed her husband<br />same as if she shot him.
3379647 3382309 You mustn't say unkind things<br />about my sister-in-law.
3385954 3388184 Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.
3388256 3390349 I forgot how you liked her.
3391225 3395252 But she just ain't in the same class<br />with you and I can't help it if I think so.
3396064 3398726 Well, anyway, I got to be going.
3399367 3403133 I'm scared somebody'll recognize<br />this carriage if I stayed here any longer.
3403204 3405399 That wouldn't do you no good.
3405907 3407340 And, Miss Wilkes...
3407875 3411276 if you ever see me on the street,<br />you don't have to speak to me.
3411879 3413471 I'll understand.
3414015 3418076 I should be proud to speak to you.<br />Proud to be under obligation to you.
3419153 3420882 I hope we meet again.
3420955 3423185 Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fitting.
3425259 3428285 - Good night, Miss Wilkes.<br />- Good night, Miss Watling.
3433568 3435729 And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
3435803 3437998 She's brokenhearted about her husband.
3482383 3484647 Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.
3510878 3513369 Miss Scarlett, Capt. Butler here<br />to see you.
3513448 3515609 I told him you was prostrate with grief.
3515683 3518311 Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
3548916 3550349 She says she's coming.
3550418 3553080 I don't know why she's coming.<br />But she's a-coming.
3553187 3554677 You don't like me, Mammy.
3554755 3557986 Now don't you argue with me.<br />You don't. You really don't.
3570071 3571902 It's no good, Scarlett.
3571973 3573031 What?
3573107 3574506 The cologne.
3574642 3576803 I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
3577311 3580712 I mean you've been drinking.<br />Brandy. Quite a lot.
3581415 3584578 What if I have? Is that any of your affair?
3586554 3588317 Don't drink alone, Scarlett.
3588389 3591290 People always find out<br />and it ruins the reputation.
3597798 3598924 What is it?
3599000 3601366 This is more than losing old Frank.
3601435 3602800 Oh, Rhett...
3602870 3604235 I'm so afraid.
3604305 3607001 I don't believe it.<br />You've never been afraid in your life.
3607074 3608541 I'm afraid now.
3608809 3611437 I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
3612780 3615715 You look pretty healthy,<br />and maybe there isn't any hell.
3615783 3618980 Oh, there is. I know there is.<br />I was raised on it.
3619921 3623550 Well, far be it from me<br />to question the teachings of childhood.
3623624 3626923 Tell me what you've done<br />that hell yawns before you.
3627828 3630558 I ought never to have married Frank<br />to begin with.
3630631 3633691 He was Suellen's beau<br />and he loved her, not me.
3634001 3636731 And I made him miserable.<br />And I killed him.
3637271 3639205 Yes, I did. I killed him.
3642643 3647307 For the first time I'm finding out what it is<br />to be sorry for something I've done.
3647848 3649839 Here. Dry your eyes.
3650751 3653618 If you had it all to do over again,<br />you'd do no differently.
3653754 3656723 You're like the thief who isn't<br />the least bit sorry he stole...
3656791 3659783 but he's terribly, terribly sorry<br />he's going to jail.
3659860 3661828 I'm glad Mother's dead.
3662563 3665225 I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
3666167 3669330 I always wanted to be like her,<br />calm and kind and...
3670137 3673106 And I certainly have<br />turned out disappointing.
3674542 3678103 You know, Scarlett, I think<br />you're on the verge of a crying jag.
3686053 3689250 So I'll change the subject<br />and say what I came to say.
3689323 3691348 Say it, then, and get out!
3692226 3693215 What is it?
3693294 3696092 That I can't go on any longer without you.
3696163 3700259 You are the most ill-bred man to come<br />here at a time like this with your filthy...
3700334 3702928 I made up my mind that you were<br />the only woman for me...
3703004 3704665 the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.
3704739 3707264 Now that you've got the lumber mill<br />and Frank's money...
3707341 3709673 you won't come to me<br />as you did to the jail.
3709744 3711712 So I see I shall have to marry you.
3712380 3714245 I never heard of such bad taste.
3714315 3716510 Would you be more convinced<br />if I fell to my knees?
3716584 3718677 Turn me loose, you varmint,<br />and get out of here!
3718753 3721984 Forgive me for startling you<br />with the impetuosity of my sentiments...
3722056 3724581 my dear Scarlett.<br />I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
3724659 3727787 But it cannot have escaped your notice<br />that for some time past...
3727862 3731263 the friendship I have felt for you<br />has ripened into a deeper feeling.
3731332 3734733 A feeling more beautiful,<br />more pure, more sacred.
3735836 3737929 Dare I name it? Can it be love?
3738572 3741166 Get up off your knees.<br />I don't like your common jokes.
3741242 3743107 This is an honorable proposal<br />of marriage...
3743177 3745702 made at what I consider<br />a most opportune moment.
3746681 3749650 I can't go all my life waiting<br />to catch you between husbands.
3750284 3752445 You're coarse, and you're conceited.
3753454 3756014 And I think this conversation<br />has gone far enough.
3756957 3759425 Besides, I shall never marry again.
3760494 3763190 Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.
3763531 3765260 You? You?
3766000 3767365 I don't love you!
3767868 3770132 And I don't like being married.
3771105 3773505 Did you ever think<br />of marrying just for fun?
3773574 3777010 Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.<br />Fun for men, you mean.
3777812 3779837 Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?
3779914 3782348 You've been married to a boy<br />and an old man.
3782416 3785476 Why not try a husband of the right age,<br />with a way with women?
3786354 3790848 You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know<br />I shall always love another man.
3792193 3795822 Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?<br />Stop it! No more of that talk.
3801836 3803303 Rhett, don't, I shall faint.
3803371 3806135 I want you to faint.<br />This is what you were meant for.
3806207 3809404 None of the fools you've known<br />have kissed you like this, have they?
3809477 3812071 Your Charles, or your Frank,<br />or your stupid Ashley.
3820254 3823519 Say you're going to marry me.<br />Say "yes. " Say "yes. "
3823591 3824615 Yes.
3826761 3829423 Are you sure you meant it?<br />You don't want to take it back?
3829497 3830521 No.
3831165 3833793 Look at me and try to tell me the truth.
3833868 3836393 Did you say "yes" because of my money?
3836470 3837459 Well...
3837772 3839205 Yes. Partly.
3840408 3841500 Partly?
3842209 3846942 Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,<br />and of course I am fond of you.
3847114 3848138 Fond of me?
3848215 3851707 If I said I was madly in love with you,<br />you'd know I was lying...
3851786 3853811 but you always said<br />we had a lot in common...
3853888 3855549 Yes, you're right, my dear.
3855623 3858091 I'm not in love with you any more<br />than you are with me.
3858159 3860889 Heaven help the man<br />who ever really loves you.
3860961 3863054 What kind of a ring would you like,<br />my darling?
3863130 3866327 A diamond ring.<br />And do buy a great big one, Rhett.
3866400 3869301 You shall have the biggest<br />and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
3869370 3872100 We'll go to New Orleans<br />for the most expensive honeymoon...
3872173 3873333 my ill-gotten gains can buy.
3873407 3875068 That would be just heavenly.
3875142 3877337 And I think I'll buy your trousseau<br />for you, too.
3877411 3879538 Rhett, how wonderful, but...
3879713 3882273 you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?
3882349 3884374 Still the little hypocrite.
3886487 3888512 Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?
3888589 3891353 Don't you think you've had enough kissing<br />for one afternoon?
3891425 3892517 You're impossible.
3892593 3894993 You can go and I don't care<br />if you never come back.
3895062 3896859 But I will come back.
3911378 3913437 What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
3913547 3916072 I'm thinking about how rich we are.
3917418 3919750 Rhett, I can keep<br />the lumber business too, can't I?
3919820 3921981 Yes, of course you can, if it amuses you.
3922056 3925025 Now that you're rich<br />you can tell everyone to go to the devil...
3925092 3926684 as you've always said you wanted to.
3926760 3929228 But you were the main one<br />I wanted to go to the devil.
3947181 3950878 Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.<br />I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
3950951 3954853 Rhett, can I have one of those<br />chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?
3954922 3958255 If you don't stop being such a glutton,<br />you'll get as fat as Mammy.
3958325 3959656 Then I'll divorce you.
3960594 3963324 Wouldn't it be nice if you bought<br />something for Mammy, too?
3963397 3967060 Why should I buy her a present<br />when she called us both mules?
3967134 3968567 Mules? Why mules?
3968636 3972402 Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,<br />and get ourselves all slicked up...
3972473 3975101 like racehorses but we were just mules<br />in horse harness...
3975175 3977268 and we didn't fool anybody.
3977645 3979442 I never heard anything more true.
3979513 3981310 Mammy's a smart old soul...
3981382 3984681 and one of the few people I know<br />whose respect I'd like to have.
3985419 3987649 I won't give her a thing.<br />She doesn't deserve it.
3987721 3989484 Then I'll take her a petticoat.
3989557 3991752 My Mammy always said<br />when she went to heaven...
3991825 3995784 she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,<br />so stiff that it would stand by itself...
3995863 3999094 and so rustly, the Lord would think<br />it was made of angels' wings.
3999166 4002329 Well, she won't take it from you.<br />She'd rather die than wear it.
4002403 4005167 That may be, but I'm making the gesture<br />just the same.
4009877 4012072 Wake up! Wake up!
4014014 4016482 You were having another nightmare.
4017051 4018416 Oh, Rhett.
4018485 4020680 I was so cold and hungry...
4020754 4022415 and so tired I...
4022856 4026815 I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist<br />and I couldn't find it.
4027661 4030186 - Find what, honey?<br />- I don't know.
4030431 4033491 I always dream the same dream<br />and I never know.
4033601 4035592 It seems to be hidden in the mist.
4035669 4036761 Darling.
4038072 4042202 Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream<br />that I've found it and that I'm safe?
4043544 4047640 Dreams don't work that way, but when<br />you get used to being safe and warm...
4048115 4050345 you'll stop dreaming that dream.
4050417 4053784 And, Scarlett, I'm going to see<br />that you are safe.
4057758 4060420 Would you do something<br />for me if I asked you?
4060494 4062121 You know I would.
4062930 4065228 Will you take me away from here?
4065566 4067033 Don't you like New Orleans?
4067101 4071197 I love New Orleans,<br />but I want to go home and visit Tara.
4072039 4074064 Will you take me to Tara?
4074408 4078902 Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.<br />We'll go tomorrow.
4082316 4085114 You get your strength<br />from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.
4085185 4087244 You're part of it, and it's part of you.
4087321 4091052 Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara<br />the way it was before the war.
4091125 4094026 Would you?<br />Then go ahead and make it that way.
4094561 4097860 Spend whatever you want,<br />make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
4098465 4099955 Oh, Rhett.
4100567 4102330 Rhett, you are good to me.
4102403 4104735 And can we still have<br />our big new house in Atlanta?
4104805 4107365 Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want:
4107841 4110207 Marble terraces, stained-glass windows<br />and all.
4110277 4112177 Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?
4112246 4115647 I want everybody who's been mean to me<br />to be pea-green with envy.
4117217 4121381 I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,<br />building that new house just to show off...
4121522 4123752 and even taking our servants.
4124725 4127626 Oh, darling, you mustn't think<br />unkindly of her.
4128095 4131121 She's made it possible for us<br />to keep Tara always.
4131198 4133189 Yes, and what good is Tara?
4133267 4136828 She's had three husbands<br />and I'll be an old maid.
4139840 4141671 Great Jehoshaphat!
4142476 4144171 Great Jehoshaphat!
4144611 4146442 Lordsy, we sure is rich now!
4146513 4147844 It ain't quality.
4148382 4150577 But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?
4151051 4153781 I'm entitled to at least see<br />what my own child looks like.
4153854 4157620 You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.<br />You'll be seeing it for a long time.
4158158 4160991 I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,<br />about it's not being a boy.
4161061 4163427 Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.<br />Who wants a boy?
4163497 4166694 Boys aren't any use to anybody.<br />Don't you think I'm proof of that?
4167468 4169299 Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.
4169369 4171894 Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
4172206 4173537 She sure is.
4174441 4176068 Did you ever see a prettier one?
4176143 4180443 Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh<br />that pretty when she come, but not quite.
4180514 4182539 Have another glass, Mammy.
4186620 4188713 What's that rustling noise I hear?
4188789 4193021 Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothing but<br />my red silk petticoat you done give me.
4193093 4196187 Nothing but your petticoat?<br />I don't believe it. Let me see.
4196263 4197855 Pull up your skirt.
4197931 4200126 Mr. Rhett, you is bad.
4200567 4201795 Yeah, oh, Lord!
4207741 4210904 You sure took a long enough time<br />about wearing it.
4210978 4212605 Yes, sir, too long.
4213313 4215508 No more mule in horse's harness?
4215582 4218813 Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad<br />telling you about that.
4218886 4221821 You ain't holding that<br />against old Mammy, is you?
4221889 4224722 No, I ain't holding it against you.<br />I just wanted to know.
4224792 4227693 Have another glass, Mammy.<br />Here, take the whole bottle.
4227761 4230753 Dr. Meade says you may go in now,<br />Capt. Butler.
4234101 4236262 This sure is a happy day to me.
4236336 4239567 I done diapered three generations<br />of this family's girls...
4239640 4241699 and it sure is a happy day.
4241875 4245242 Oh, yes, Mammy.<br />The happiest days are when babies come.
4245312 4246711 I wish...
4247047 4250210 Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.<br />What do you suppose they'll name her?
4250317 4252717 Miss Scarlett done told me<br />if it was a girl...
4252820 4256051 she's going to name it Eugenie Victoria.
4256723 4257951 Yes...
4258025 4259959 she's a beautiful baby...
4260727 4263127 the most beautiful baby ever.
4264198 4265392 Yes.
4266934 4269266 Do you know that this is your birthday?
4269970 4272131 That you're a week old today?
4272773 4277608 Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes<br />of which this town has never seen.
4278645 4282172 Yes, I'm gonna send her<br />to the best schools in Charleston.
4282249 4286276 Yes. And her'll be received<br />by the best families in the South.
4287120 4289611 And when it comes time for her to marry...
4289690 4292625 well, she'll be a little princess.
4293527 4295722 You certainly are making a fool of yourself.
4295796 4297058 And why shouldn't I?
4298098 4301397 She's the first person<br />who's ever completely belonged to me.
4302402 4304097 Great balls of fire!
4304171 4306002 I had the baby, didn't I?
4306640 4308198 It's Melanie. May I come in?
4308275 4309435 Come in, Melly.
4309509 4313172 Yes, come in and look at my daughter's<br />beautiful blue eyes.
4314815 4317909 But, Capt. Butler, most babies<br />have blue eyes when they're born.
4318018 4321078 Don't try to tell him anything.<br />He knows everything about babies.
4321154 4324351 Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br />and they're going to stay blue.
4324424 4326756 As blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag.
4327327 4329818 That's it. That's what we'll call her.
4329897 4331626 Bonnie Blue Butler.
4339871 4341463 Try again, Mammy.
4349080 4350206 Twenty inches.
4350715 4353775 Twenty inches!<br />I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
4353851 4356649 You've simply got to make it<br />18.5 again, Mammy.
4356721 4358313 You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...
4358389 4360880 and you ain't never going to be<br />no 18.5 inches again.
4360959 4363951 Never. And there ain't nothing<br />to do about it.
4364529 4366690 There is something to do about it!
4366764 4370097 I'm just not going to get old and fat<br />before my time.
4370501 4372901 I just won't have any more babies!
4373371 4377102 I heard Mr. Rhett say<br />that he'll be wanting a son next year.
4377175 4380008 Go tell Capt. Butler<br />I've decided not to go out after all.
4380078 4382012 I'll have supper in my room.
4402367 4406098 I got your message. I'll have them bring<br />my supper up here, too.
4413111 4414806 No objections to that, I hope?
4414912 4416038 No.
4417315 4418475 Yes.
4420284 4423185 I mean, I don't care<br />where you have your supper.
4425423 4426447 Rhett?
4427325 4428349 Yes?
4428426 4429757 You see...
4430028 4431928 well, I've decided...
4433931 4436832 well, I hope I don't have<br />any more children.
4449047 4451948 My pet, as I told you<br />before Bonnie was born...
4452850 4455842 it's immaterial to me<br />whether you have one child or 20!
4455953 4458046 No, but you know what I...
4458189 4459781 Do you know what I mean?
4459857 4462917 I do. And do you know<br />I can divorce you for this?
4463895 4466386 You're just low enough<br />to think of something like that!
4466464 4470400 If you had any chivalry in you or would<br />be nice, like... Well, Ashley Wilkes!
4470468 4472993 Melanie can't have any more children<br />and he...
4475106 4477939 You've been to the lumber office<br />this afternoon, haven't you?
4478009 4480341 What has that got to do with it?
4481245 4484703 Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br />Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.
4484782 4487012 It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
4488319 4490310 You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
4490388 4491548 Sorry for me?
4491622 4494921 Yes, because you're throwing away<br />happiness with both hands...
4494992 4497756 and reaching out for something<br />that'll never make you happy.
4497829 4499558 I don't know what you're talking about.
4499630 4502861 If you were free and Melly were dead<br />and you had your precious...
4502934 4505835 honorable Ashley, do you think<br />you'd be happy with him?
4506704 4510162 You'd never know him,<br />never even understand his mind...
4510441 4513342 any more than you understand anything<br />except money.
4513411 4515675 Never mind about that!<br />What I want to know is...
4515747 4519615 You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.<br />It'll work no hardship on me.
4520084 4521642 Do you mean to say you don't care?
4521719 4525450 The world is full of many things<br />and many people, and I shan't be lonely.
4526023 4527957 I'll find comfort elsewhere.
4528025 4530016 Well, that's fine. But I warn you.
4530094 4533257 Just in case you change your mind,<br />I intend to lock my door.
4533331 4536789 Why bother? If I wanted to come in,<br />no lock could keep me out!
4555419 4558820 I always knew that most women<br />were cheats, hypocritical and hard.
4558890 4561324 - But this one...<br />- Rhett, it ain't no use.
4561392 4564293 - What do you mean?<br />- I mean you're poisoned with her.
4564362 4567559 I don't care what she's done to you,<br />you're still in love with her.
4567632 4569691 And don't think it pleasures me none<br />to say it.
4569767 4572668 Maybe so! But I'm through with her,<br />I tell you! I'm through.
4572737 4576400 You gotta think of the child.<br />The child's worth ten of the mother.
4582680 4585911 You're a shrewd woman, Belle,<br />and a very nice one.
4587552 4588541 Yes, Rhett?
4588619 4592180 I was just thinking of the difference<br />between you and...
4592256 4595714 You're both hardheaded businesswomen<br />and you're both successful.
4595793 4597886 But you've got a heart, Belle...
4599530 4601157 and you're honest.
4603601 4605159 Goodbye, Rhett.
4606070 4607628 Goodbye, Belle.
4623187 4625348 She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!
4625590 4627615 Look at those hands, and that seat!
4627859 4628917 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
4628993 4632326 Why do we have to wheel a baby<br />when there are servants...
4632396 4633795 Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
4633865 4635059 Good morning, Capt. Butler.
4635132 4636463 Good morning, Scarlett.
4636534 4639128 Making fools of ourselves<br />in front of these old buffaloes!
4639203 4642695 If you'd thought of your position<br />years ago, you wouldn't have to do this.
4642773 4647210 But as it is, we'll cultivate every female<br />dragon of the old guard in this town.
4647645 4649135 Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
4649213 4652512 Good morning, Capt. Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
4653284 4656515 So the millionaire speculator<br />is turning respectable!
4656654 4658918 All of our money can't buy<br />what I want for Bonnie.
4658990 4661220 Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.
4661292 4663817 But Bonnie's going to have her place<br />among decent people.
4663895 4667490 Yes, even if we both have to crawl<br />on our bellies to every fat old cat.
4668266 4669961 Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
4670268 4672930 Good morning, Capt. Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
4679143 4682271 Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had<br />a great regard for your knowledge.
4682346 4684075 I wonder if you could give me<br />some advice.
4684148 4685206 Certainly.
4685283 4687615 My Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br />I can't make her stop it.
4687685 4690119 Make her stop it.<br />It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
4690187 4691279 I know, I know.
4691355 4694984 She has such a beautiful mouth, too.<br />I tried putting soap under her nails.
4695059 4696151 Soap! Bah!
4696227 4699719 Put quinine on her thumb<br />and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
4699964 4702762 Quinine! I never would have thought of it.
4702833 4705028 I can't thank you enough,<br />Mrs. Merriwether.
4705102 4708196 You've taken a great load off my mind!<br />Good morning.
4711809 4713299 Good morning, Dolly.
4713377 4715004 Wasn't that Capt. Butler?
4715079 4717946 Good morning, Caroline.<br />I was just thinking.
4718015 4722111 There must be a great deal of good<br />in a man who could love a child so much.
4722186 4724051 But of course there is!
4724121 4727887 Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing<br />told Dr. Meade that Capt. Butler...
4727959 4730792 finally admitted he was honored<br />by the Confederate Congress...
4730861 4732886 for his services at the Battle of Franklin?
4732964 4736092 No! And did I tell you, Caroline,<br />that Capt. Butler...
4736167 4739728 made a stupendous contribution<br />to the Association for the Beautification...
4739804 4741738 of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
4741806 4742864 No.
4743541 4747307 My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,<br />is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
4747378 4750176 Why, Dolly Merriwether,<br />you know right well it was my idea...
4750247 4751771 to give a party for Bonnie Butler.
4751849 4753180 Why Caroline Meade...
4762293 4765729 Now watch Daddy put your pony over,<br />Bonnie. Now watch.
4768466 4770764 Daddy, let me! Let me!
4770935 4773529 All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!
4776974 4778236 Up we go.
4778442 4779739 Oh, there!
4780044 4782535 Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!
4782613 4786310 Grip tightly with your legs. Sit close.<br />Lean forward. Be sure you go with him.
4786384 4789148 Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.<br />Up!
4790021 4792148 That was fine! I knew you'd do it!
4792223 4795420 When you get a little older,<br />I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
4795493 4799395 You'll be the greatest horsewoman<br />in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
4800097 4801860 Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!
4802500 4803660 Mr. Rhett!
4804568 4807162 Did you see her, Mammy?<br />Wasn't she wonderful?
4807238 4811174 Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you<br />it just ain't fitting...
4811242 4814439 for a girl child to ride astraddle<br />with her dress flying up!
4814512 4816878 All right, Mammy.<br />I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
4816947 4820178 And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.<br />She'll love that.
4820251 4822549 A nice black broadcloth<br />is what little girls wear.
4822620 4824747 Now, Mammy, be reasonable.
4825256 4827451 Well, I don't think it's fitting, but...
4829493 4832155 It ain't fitting, it just ain't fitting.
4833130 4834427 It ain't fitting.
4844909 4846376 Why, Scarlett!
4846710 4848837 What are you doing downtown<br />at this time of day?
4848913 4849971 Ashley, I just...
4850047 4853608 Why aren't you helping Melly get ready<br />for my surprise birthday party?
4853684 4857279 Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed<br />to know anything about that.
4857354 4860084 Melly'd be so disappointed<br />if you weren't surprised.
4860157 4863615 I won't let on.<br />I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
4864328 4866660 As long as you're here,<br />let me show you the books...
4866730 4869528 so you can see just how bad<br />a businessman I really am.
4869600 4871761 Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.
4871836 4874634 When I'm wearing a new bonnet,<br />all the figures I ever knew...
4874705 4876434 go right slap out of my head.
4876507 4880136 The figures are well lost<br />when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.
4880211 4883180 Scarlett, you know,<br />you get prettier all the time.
4884148 4887982 You haven't changed a bit since the day<br />of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
4888519 4891886 where you sat under a tree<br />surrounded by dozens of beaux.
4893524 4895924 That girl doesn't exist anymore.
4896427 4899260 Nothing's turned out<br />as I expected, Ashley.
4899330 4900627 Nothing.
4901132 4905432 Yes, we've traveled a long road<br />since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?
4905503 4907232 Oh, the lazy days...
4907304 4909829 the warm, still country twilights...
4910808 4914039 the high, soft Negro laughter<br />from the quarters...
4914612 4917843 the golden warmth and security<br />of those days.
4920084 4922075 Don't look back, Ashley.
4922286 4923913 Don't look back.
4925589 4930288 It drags at your heart<br />till you can't do anything but look back.
4935432 4938128 I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
4938802 4942294 I never want you to be anything<br />but completely happy.
4962259 4963317 Oh, Ashley!
4965829 4966921 Who is it?
4966997 4968658 Only your husband.
4969300 4970562 Come in.
4971602 4974696 Am I actually being invited<br />into the sanctuary?
4975372 4977772 You're not ready for Melanie's party.
4977841 4979365 I've got a headache, Rhett.
4979443 4982640 You go without me<br />and make my excuses to Melanie.
4983914 4987441 What a white-livered little coward<br />you are. Get up.
4987518 4989850 You're going to that party<br />and you'll have to hurry.
4989920 4991512 - Has India dared to...<br />- Yes. India has!
4991589 4993523 Every woman and man in town<br />knows the story!
4993591 4995218 You should kill them, spreading lies.
4995292 4998125 I have a strange way of not killing people<br />who tell the truth.
4998195 4999719 There's no time to argue. Get up!
4999797 5002766 I won't go! I can't go<br />till this misunderstanding is cleared up.
5002833 5005529 Don't cheat Melly<br />out of the satisfaction of publicly...
5005603 5006900 ordering you out of her house.
5006971 5008836 There was nothing wrong.<br />India hates me so.
5008906 5010669 I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.
5010741 5014233 If you don't go, you won't be able<br />to show your face as long as you live.
5014311 5017212 That wouldn't bother me, but<br />you won't ruin Bonnie's chances.
5017281 5021047 You're going to that party,<br />if only for her sake. Now get dressed!
5034164 5038032 Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly<br />will do for this occasion.
5038102 5041299 And put on plenty of rouge.<br />I want you to look your part tonight.
5048379 5053248 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
5053684 5058485 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
5059156 5062853 <i>Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
5063594 5066028 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
5067831 5070356 - Good night, Scarlett.<br />- But Rhett, you can't...
5070434 5073403 You go into the arena alone.<br />The lions are hungry for you.
5073470 5075199 Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.
5075272 5076569 You're not afraid?
5076640 5078767 <i>Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
5078842 5083404 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
5083514 5087951 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
5103300 5105598 What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.
5105669 5107330 India wasn't able to come tonight.
5107404 5108632 Will you be an angel?
5108706 5111937 I do need you to help me<br />receive my guests.
5115012 5116445 Mrs. Meade...
5116680 5118841 here's our darling Scarlett.
5120351 5121409 Good evening.
5121518 5122780 Good evening.
5122853 5124252 Why, Scarlett!
5124688 5127555 - Good evening, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good evening, Mrs. Butler.
5128325 5131817 Ashley, aren't you going to get<br />our Scarlett a glass of punch?
5139403 5142338 Did you have a good time tonight<br />at Miss Melly's party, child?
5142406 5143430 Yes, yes.
5143507 5145372 Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word.
5145442 5148536 If Capt. Butler asks for me<br />when he comes back, I'm asleep.
5148912 5150174 Yes, ma'am.
5179343 5181140 Come in, Mrs. Butler.
5190154 5191485 Come here.
5207171 5208195 Sit down!
5210874 5214310 There's no reason why you shouldn't have<br />your nightcap even if I am here.
5214378 5216812 I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and...
5216880 5219144 You heard nothing of the kind.
5219216 5222014 You wouldn't have come down<br />if you'd thought I was here.
5222085 5224315 - You must need a drink badly.<br />- I do not!
5224388 5227186 Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
5227257 5230317 I know you drink on the quiet,<br />and I know how much you drink.
5230761 5233059 Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
5239837 5241532 You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!
5241605 5243095 I'm very drunk...
5243440 5246637 and I intend getting still drunker<br />before the evening's over...
5247444 5250174 but you're not going to bed, not yet.
5251448 5252574 Sit down.
5255786 5257720 So she stood by you, did she?
5258956 5262551 How does it feel to have the woman<br />you've wronged cloak your sins for you?
5264228 5267197 You're wondering if she knows<br />all about you and Ashley.
5267464 5270058 You're wondering if she did it<br />just to save her face.
5270467 5274335 You're thinking that she's a fool for<br />doing it even if it did save your hide.
5274404 5276565 - I will not listen.<br />- Yes, you'll listen!
5277641 5280041 Miss Melly's a fool,<br />but not the kind you think.
5280644 5284239 It's just that there's too much honor in her<br />to ever conceive of dishonor...
5284314 5285906 in anyone she loves.
5286683 5288275 And she loves you.
5288719 5291552 Though just why she does,<br />I'm sure I don't know!
5292723 5295988 If you weren't so drunk and insulting,<br />I could explain everything.
5296460 5299520 - As it is, though...<br />- If you get out of that chair once more...
5303767 5308397 Of course, the comic figure in all this<br />is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
5309439 5312408 Mr. Wilkes, who can't be<br />mentally faithful to his wife...
5312509 5315069 and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
5316747 5318510 Why doesn't he make up his mind?
5318615 5320105 Rhett, you...
5323153 5325553 Observe my hands, my dear.
5326557 5328991 I could tear you to pieces with them.
5329660 5333187 And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley<br />out of your mind forever.
5334264 5335822 But it wouldn't.
5336667 5340433 So I'll remove him<br />from your mind forever this way.
5341638 5343731 I'll put my hands so...
5344608 5346735 one on each side of your head...
5347744 5351805 and I'll smash your skull between them<br />like a walnut.
5352616 5354846 That'll block him out.
5356119 5358815 Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.
5364094 5367325 You know I've always admired<br />your spirit, my dear.
5368298 5371062 Never more than now,<br />when you're cornered.
5371768 5373133 I'm not cornered.
5373203 5376036 You'll never corner me,<br />Rhett Butler, or frighten me!
5376106 5379598 You've lived in dirt so long,<br />you can't understand anything else.
5379676 5383407 And you're jealous of something<br />you can't understand. Good night!
5385949 5387314 Jealous, am I?
5387417 5389214 Yes, I suppose I am.
5389820 5393312 Even though I know<br />you've been faithful to me all along.
5393457 5394685 How do I know?
5394825 5397988 Because I know Ashley Wilkes<br />and his honorable breed.
5398595 5400187 They're gentlemen.
5400330 5403561 And that's more than I can say<br />for you or for me.
5404001 5407528 We're not gentlemen,<br />and we have no honor, have we?
5417180 5419273 It's not that easy, Scarlett.
5423253 5425585 You turned me out<br />while you chased Ashley Wilkes...
5425656 5427453 while you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.
5427524 5429754 This is one night<br />you're not turning me out.
5458255 5460382 How are you feeling<br />this morning, Mammy?
5460457 5464325 Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.
5467297 5469822 You acting mighty happy this morning,<br />Miss Scarlett.
5469966 5471433 I am, Mammy. I am.
5478575 5483410 <i>Oh, she wept with delight<br />when he gave her a smile</i>
5483914 5487873 <i>And trembled with fear at his frown</i>
5505368 5506392 Hello.
5509239 5512834 I'd like to extend my apology<br />for my conduct of last night.
5513110 5514737 Oh, but Rhett...
5514811 5516039 I was very drunk...
5516113 5519378 and quite swept off my feet<br />by your charms.
5521818 5525379 Well, you needn't bother to apologize.<br />Nothing you ever do surprises me!
5525889 5528687 I've been thinking things over,<br />and I really believe that...
5528759 5530283 it would be better for both of us...
5530360 5533090 if we admitted we'd made a mistake<br />and got a divorce.
5533430 5534897 - A divorce?<br />- Yes.
5534965 5537661 There's no point in our holding on<br />to each other, is there?
5537734 5540134 I'll provide for you amply.<br />You've plenty of grounds.
5540203 5543172 Just give me Bonnie.<br />Say what you please. I won't contest.
5543240 5544229 Thank you very much.
5544307 5547333 But I wouldn't dream<br />of disgracing my family with a divorce.
5548078 5550569 You'd disgrace it quick enough<br />if Ashley were free.
5550647 5553639 It makes my head spin to think<br />how quickly you'd divorce me.
5554785 5556184 Wouldn't you, Scarlett?
5557621 5558849 Well, answer me.
5558922 5559946 Wouldn't you?
5560023 5562253 Will you please go now<br />and leave me alone?
5563794 5566592 Yes, I'm going.<br />That's what I came to tell you.
5567130 5571260 I'm going on a very extended trip<br />to London, and I'm leaving today.
5571868 5573529 And I'm taking Bonnie with me.
5573603 5576094 So you'll please<br />get her little duds packed right away.
5576173 5578698 You'll never take my child<br />out of this house.
5578775 5580640 She's my child, too, Scarlett.
5580744 5582302 I wouldn't leave her here...
5582379 5585576 with a mother who hasn't the decency<br />to consider her own reputation.
5585649 5587139 You're a fine one to talk.
5587217 5589117 You think I'll let her out of this house...
5589186 5592781 when you'll probably have her around<br />with people like that Belle?
5592856 5595222 If you were a man<br />I'd break your neck for that.
5595492 5597790 As it is, I'll thank you<br />to shut your stupid mouth.
5597861 5600830 As for you, giving yourself pious airs<br />about your motherhood...
5600897 5602831 Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.
5602899 5606130 Have her things packed and ready<br />for me in an hour, or I warn you...
5606203 5610105 I've always thought a good lashing with a<br />buggy whip would benefit you immensely.
5615512 5617104 Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
5617747 5618839 Hello, Uncle Rhett.
5618915 5620382 Hello, hello, Beau.
5620450 5622008 Daddy, Daddy.
5622185 5625643 Where have you been?<br />I've been waiting for you all morning.
5625722 5629249 Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin<br />to wrap my little Bonnie in.
5629426 5631724 Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
5634764 5637858 I'm going to take you<br />on a long trip to fairyland.
5638902 5640199 Where? Where?
5640604 5644199 I'm going to show you the Tower<br />of London, where the little princes were...
5644507 5646168 and London Bridge.
5646509 5647942 London Bridge!
5648044 5649841 Will it be falling down?
5651248 5653512 Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
5656152 5658279 Daddy, dark!
5659656 5661146 Dark!
5661324 5663315 Daddy! Dark!
5664394 5667124 It's all right.<br />Who put out that light? Nurse!
5667197 5668630 Daddy, dark!
5669933 5671025 Daddy, dark!
5671101 5672762 There. Yes, yes.
5673336 5675236 What's the matter with my Bonnie?
5675305 5676602 A bear.
5677040 5679304 Oh, a bear? A big bear?
5679776 5682677 Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.
5682779 5686078 Well, I'll stay here and shoot him<br />if he comes back.
5701298 5703266 Good evening, Mr. Butler.
5706136 5708730 Haven't I told you never to leave her alone<br />in the dark?
5708805 5712901 If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often<br />afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
5712976 5714841 Just let her scream for a night or two.
5714911 5718642 Let her scream! Either you're a fool or<br />the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!
5718715 5721479 Of course, if you want her<br />to grow up nervous and cowardly.
5721551 5722609 Cowardly!
5722686 5726053 There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.<br />You're discharged!
5726957 5728117 As you say, sir.
5745141 5746631 Where is Mother?
5753183 5755310 Aren't you happy here in London with me?
5755986 5758477 I want to go home.
5770667 5772032 Miss Bonnie.
5772335 5774269 And Capt. Butler.
5774537 5776562 - Miss Scarlett.<br />- Hello, Mammy.
5776639 5777867 Honey child.
5779275 5782073 Miss Scarlett! They's back.<br />They's back, Miss Scarlett.
5782245 5783439 Bonnie.
5784381 5786281 Bonnie. Bonnie, baby.
5786616 5787913 Darling baby.
5787984 5789383 Are you glad to be home?
5789452 5791010 Daddy gave me a kitten.
5791087 5794352 - What a lovely kitten.<br />- London's a horrid place.
5794891 5797155 - Oh, my darling.<br />- Where's my pony?
5797360 5800557 - I want to go out and see my pony.<br />- You go out and see your pony.
5810040 5811598 Where's my pony?
5812709 5814438 I wanna go out and see my pony.
5815178 5816805 You run along with Mammy.
5816880 5818472 - Come on, honey child.<br />- Go with Mammy.
5818548 5820539 Mammy sure has missed you, honey.
5822719 5824152 Mrs. Butler, I believe.
5825188 5826678 Mammy said you'd come back.
5828158 5829648 But only to bring Bonnie.
5829726 5833127 Apparently any mother, even a bad one,<br />is better for a child than none.
5833930 5835693 You mean you're going away again?
5836099 5837657 What perception, Mrs. Butler.
5838034 5839126 Right away.
5839269 5841601 In fact, I left my bags at the station.
5843440 5846637 You're looking pale.<br />Is there a shortage of rouge?
5846709 5849473 Or can this wanness mean<br />you've been missing me?
5850113 5851671 If I'm pale, it's your fault.
5851748 5854774 Not because I've been missing you,<br />but because...
5858488 5860422 Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
5861224 5863488 It's because I'm going to have a baby.
5869532 5870556 Indeed?
5871034 5872797 And who's the happy father?
5873603 5875093 You know it's yours.
5875171 5876968 I don't want it any more than you do.
5877040 5879201 No woman would want the child<br />of a cad like you.
5879275 5881971 I wish it were anybody's child but yours.
5883947 5886279 Well, cheer up.<br />Maybe you'll have an accident.
5900897 5902421 Is she better?
5906636 5908035 Has she asked for me?
5908104 5910197 Don't you understand? She's delirious.
5911741 5913538 Rhett.
5914811 5916438 I want Rhett.
5920717 5924118 What's the matter, honey?<br />Did you call somebody, child?
5924187 5925620 It's no use.
5926890 5928050 It's no use.
5950213 5951771 Dr. Meade's left.
5952882 5954213 Scarlett's dead!
5954284 5956013 Oh, no, she's much better.
5956586 5957917 Really, she is.
5974637 5977731 There, there, Capt. Butler.<br />You're beside yourself.
5977807 5980037 She'll very soon be well again,<br />I promise you.
5980109 5983078 No, you don't understand.<br />She never wanted this baby.
5983279 5985770 Not want a baby?<br />Why, every woman wants a baby!
5985848 5988715 Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.<br />Not my children.
5989118 5991245 She told me she didn't want<br />any more children...
5991321 5993380 and I wanted to hurt her<br />because she'd hurt me.
5993456 5994753 I wanted to and I did.
5994824 5997816 Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.<br />It's not fit.
5997894 6000863 I didn't know about this baby<br />until the other day when she fell.
6000930 6003922 If I'd known, I'd have come home<br />whether she wanted me or not!
6004000 6005729 Well, of course you would.
6005802 6009602 And then when she told me,<br />there on the steps, what did I do?
6009672 6012470 What did I say? I laughed and I said...
6012542 6015705 But you didn't mean it.<br />I know you didn't mean it.
6015845 6018678 Oh, but I did mean it.<br />I was crazy with jealousy.
6018748 6022343 She's never cared for me. I thought<br />I could make her care, but I couldn't.
6024220 6025881 You're so wrong.
6025955 6029288 Scarlett loves you a great deal,<br />much more than she knows.
6030860 6032828 If that were only true I could wait forever.
6032895 6035193 If she'd only forgive me,<br />forget this ever happened.
6035265 6036493 She will.
6036633 6038225 You must be patient.
6040637 6042332 Oh, no, it's not possible.
6042405 6045897 You don't understand.<br />If you only knew who she really loved...
6046542 6048476 you wouldn't believe it.
6051414 6054008 Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
6054083 6056916 No, Capt. Butler, I wouldn't believe it.
6058655 6063024 There, there. Scarlett's going to get well<br />and there can be other babies.
6063326 6067057 No, she couldn't even if she wanted to,<br />after what she's been through.
6067130 6069098 But of course she could.
6069632 6071031 I'm going to.
6073970 6077201 No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.<br />It's too dangerous.
6077674 6080734 Children are life-renewing itself,<br />Capt. Butler...
6080810 6084302 and when life does that,<br />danger seems very unimportant.
6087417 6090511 I've never before known anyone<br />who was really brave.
6091287 6094222 I pray God things go well with you,<br />Miss Melly.
6094390 6098224 And I want to thank you for all<br />you've done for me and for Scarlett.
6099362 6101353 From my heart, I thank you.
6108104 6111403 Miss Scarlett's feeling<br />a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
6111474 6112941 Thank you, Mammy.
6120149 6122413 I've come to ask your forgiveness...
6122485 6125386 in the hope that we can give<br />our life together another chance.
6125455 6127047 Our life together?
6127123 6129523 When did we ever have a life together?
6130560 6132221 Yes, you're right.
6132695 6136153 But I'm sure if we could only try again,<br />we could be happy.
6136866 6139596 What is there to make us happy now?
6140069 6142230 Well, there's Bonnie and...
6143272 6145263 and I love you, Scarlett.
6145575 6147338 When did you discover that?
6147410 6151346 I've always loved you, but you've never<br />given me a chance to show it.
6152482 6154916 Well, and just what do you want me to do?
6156753 6159381 To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.
6159756 6160916 We'll go away.
6160990 6163220 We'll take Bonnie<br />and have another honeymoon.
6163292 6166022 Give up the mill? Why?<br />It's making more money than ever.
6166095 6168029 Yes, I know, but we don't need it.
6168097 6170930 Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.
6171000 6172934 Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.
6173002 6175835 Always Melanie! If you'd think<br />a little more about me...
6175905 6177236 I am thinking of you...
6178307 6180104 and I'm thinking that...
6180309 6183540 well, maybe it's the mill<br />that's taking you away from me...
6183846 6185074 and from Bonnie.
6185148 6188140 I know what you're thinking.<br />Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.
6188217 6189912 You're the one taking her away from me.
6189986 6191112 But she loves you.
6191187 6193621 You've done everything<br />to make her love you, not me.
6193689 6194951 She's so spoiled now that...
6195024 6196491 Mommy! Daddy!
6196759 6197987 Watch me!
6198261 6200092 We're watching, darling.
6200163 6202131 You're mighty pretty, precious.
6202198 6203460 So are you.
6203866 6206494 I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.
6207236 6209932 I don't think you ought to do<br />much jumping yet, Bonnie.
6210006 6212338 Remember, you've just learned<br />to ride sidesaddle.
6212408 6213739 I will so jump!
6213843 6216676 I can jump better than ever<br />'cause I've grown...
6216813 6218405 and I've moved the bar higher.
6218481 6220278 Don't let her do it, Rhett.
6220349 6224445 No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,<br />don't cry and blame me.
6225421 6226911 Rhett, stop her!
6228891 6230017 Bonnie!
6230827 6231816 Bonnie!
6233196 6234686 Just like Pa.
6238167 6239657 Just like Pa!
6240903 6241995 Bonnie!
6250580 6251706 Bonnie!
6252348 6253508 Bonnie!
6270166 6273135 Lordsy, Miss Melly.<br />I sure is glad you've come.
6275771 6278672 This house won't seem<br />the same without Bonnie.
6278741 6280606 How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
6280676 6283509 Miss Melly, this here done<br />broke her heart...
6284247 6286841 but I didn't fetch you here<br />on Miss Scarlett's account.
6286916 6291114 What that child got to stand,<br />the good Lord give her strength to stand.
6292688 6295054 It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
6298528 6301019 He done lost his mind<br />these last couple of days.
6301130 6302563 No, Mammy, no.
6303032 6306968 I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,<br />set such store on any child.
6307770 6310170 When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...
6310239 6313936 Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there<br />and shoot that poor pony...
6314911 6317937 and for a minute I think<br />he going to shoot hisself.
6318014 6319777 Oh, poor Capt. Butler.
6319849 6324582 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him<br />a murderer for teaching that child to jump.
6325087 6327851 She say, "You give me my baby<br />what you kill. "
6327924 6331655 And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't<br />never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
6332194 6336221 It like to turn my blood cold,<br />the things they say to one another.
6336732 6339223 Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
6342004 6343767 And then that night...
6344807 6348607 Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br />in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...
6349245 6350906 and he wouldn't even open the door...
6350980 6353210 when Miss Scarlett beat on it<br />and hollered to him.
6353282 6355546 And that's the way it's been<br />for two whole days.
6355651 6356845 Oh, Mammy.
6357954 6361446 And then this evening, Miss Scarlett,<br />she shout through the door...
6361524 6363788 and she say the funeral set<br />for tomorrow morning...
6363859 6366885 and he says, "You try that<br />and I kills you tomorrow.
6366963 6369932 "Do you think I's going to put my child...
6369999 6372263 "in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
6372335 6375031 Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.
6375104 6378767 Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.<br />He ain't going to let us bury that child.
6378841 6380832 You gotta help us, Miss Melly.
6381010 6382637 Oh, but I can't intrude.
6382712 6384976 If you can't help us, who can?
6385047 6388073 Mr. Rhett always set great store<br />by your opinion.
6390119 6391882 Please, Miss Melly.
6393456 6395356 I'll do what I can, Mammy.
6402031 6404465 Get away from that door,<br />and leave us alone.
6404533 6406558 It's Mrs. Wilkes, Capt. Butler.
6406636 6408228 Please let me in.
6408304 6410295 I've come to see Bonnie.
6431260 6432625 Oh, Lord...
6433062 6436088 please help Mr. Rhett<br />in this hour of his grief.
6448044 6451275 I want you to go and make<br />a good deal of strong coffee...
6451347 6454942 and bring it up to Capt. Butler.<br />I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
6455418 6456646 But...
6456819 6460118 Capt. Butler is quite willing<br />for the funeral to take place...
6460189 6461383 tomorrow morning.
6461457 6466190 Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights<br />on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.
6467496 6469123 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
6469732 6470858 Miss Melly!
6470933 6472594 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
6474336 6476304 Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...
6477006 6478268 and try...
6478340 6480001 try to get me home.
6481711 6483269 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
6491120 6493520 Where is my mother going away to?
6493689 6496590 And why can't I go along, please?
6497126 6500459 We can't always go along, Beau,<br />much as we may want to.
6502164 6504359 You're going back to bed now.
6505000 6508197 Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!
6508938 6510337 She hasn't your strength.
6510406 6513705 She's never had any strength.<br />She's never had anything but heart.
6514210 6515643 You knew that, too.
6515711 6518544 Why do I have to go back to bed?<br />It's morning.
6519248 6521273 It isn't really morning yet.
6527523 6529184 You may come in now, Scarlett.
6529258 6530816 Please let me see her!
6530893 6534522 I've been waiting here two whole days<br />and I've got to tell her...
6534864 6536491 that I was wrong about something.
6536565 6539591 She knows you were wrong.<br />She wants to see Scarlett.
6543172 6544867 Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
6544940 6547738 I won't have you easing your conscience<br />telling her things...
6547810 6550176 that make no difference now.<br />You understand?
6565127 6566458 It's me, Melly.
6568197 6569596 Promise me?
6570266 6571255 Anything.
6572535 6574298 Look after my little son.
6575704 6577968 I gave him to you once before.
6579074 6580541 Remember?
6581410 6583037 The day he was born.
6583412 6587041 Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<br />I know you'll get well.
6587483 6588780 Promise me...
6589385 6590477 college...
6590553 6594751 Yes, and Europe, and a pony,<br />whatever he wants. But...
6595925 6597449 Melly, do try...
6597560 6598822 Ashley...
6600596 6602154 Ashley and you.
6604400 6607164 What about Ashley, Melly?
6608671 6610866 Look after him for me.
6611640 6613232 Just as you...
6614343 6617437 looked after me for him.
6619849 6621407 I will, Melly.
6622551 6624246 Look after him...
6624954 6627787 but never let him know.
6637933 6639332 Good night.
6640903 6642200 Promise?
6643572 6645199 What else, Melly?
6646041 6647804 Capt. Butler...
6649211 6650678 be kind to him.
6651380 6652404 Rhett?
6653249 6654876 He loves you so.
6658988 6660319 Yes, Melly.
6663325 6664656 Goodbye.
6665961 6667223 Goodbye.
6683279 6685338 You ladies may come in now.
6690753 6692084 Ashley.
6692955 6695549 I don't know where the mate to this is.
6696525 6698618 She must have put it away.
6699295 6700694 Oh, stop it.
6701263 6702355 Hold me.
6702765 6704357 I'm so frightened.
6706201 6707828 I'm so frightened.
6712775 6716575 Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?<br />I can't live without her, I can't.
6717947 6719847 Everything I ever had...
6719915 6721576 is going with her.
6722618 6723880 Oh, Ashley.
6725387 6727685 You really love her, don't you?
6728490 6733189 She's the only dream I ever had<br />that didn't die in the face of reality.
6733996 6737363 Dreams! Always dreams with you,<br />never common sense.
6737433 6740664 Oh, Scarlett!<br />If you knew what I've gone through!
6741370 6745466 Ashley, you should have told me years ago<br />that you loved her and not me...
6745541 6748476 and not left me dangling<br />with your talk of honor.
6748877 6752074 But you had to wait till now,<br />now when Melly's dying...
6752715 6756082 to show me that I could never mean<br />any more to you than...
6756151 6758847 than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
6760856 6763256 And I've loved something that...
6763359 6765418 that doesn't really exist.
6767930 6769158 Somehow...
6770499 6771864 I don't care.
6773402 6775097 Somehow it doesn't matter.
6777239 6779673 It doesn't matter one bit.
6783979 6785844 Ashley, forgive me.
6786215 6789116 Don't cry.<br />She mustn't see you've been crying.
6789651 6790913 Ashley!
6794323 6795620 Melly!
6797493 6798824 Melly!
6803265 6805256 Rhett, Rhett!
6808704 6810501 Rhett, where are you?
6814576 6816009 Rhett, wait for me.
6821083 6822550 Rhett, wait for me!
6849878 6851038 Rhett.
6854216 6855308 Come in.
6863325 6864587 Rhett...
6865060 6866618 Melanie, she's...
6870499 6871659 Well, God rest her.
6872434 6875562 She was the only completely kind person<br />I ever knew.
6876305 6877636 A great lady.
6878073 6879734 A very great lady.
6882111 6885512 So she's dead.<br />That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
6886348 6890079 Oh, how can you say such a thing?<br />You know how I loved her, really!
6891553 6893214 No, I don't know that I do.
6893288 6896815 But at least it's to your credit<br />that you could appreciate her at the end.
6896892 6900521 Of course I appreciated her.<br />She thought of everybody except herself.
6901330 6903161 Why, her last words were about you.
6904500 6905899 What did she say?
6905968 6907128 She said:
6907402 6910394 "Be kind to Capt. Butler. He loves you so. "
6916278 6917438 Did she say anything else?
6917513 6919003 She said...
6919448 6922110 She asked me to look after Ashley, too.
6924353 6927789 It's convenient to have<br />the first wife's permission, isn't it?
6929825 6931452 What do you mean?
6933762 6935525 What are you doing?
6935597 6937428 I'm leaving you, my dear.
6937499 6941367 All you need now is a divorce,<br />and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
6944439 6945997 Oh, no!
6946742 6948972 No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!
6949044 6952172 I don't want a divorce.<br />Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...
6952314 6954874 when I knew I loved you,<br />I ran home to tell you.
6954950 6956850 Oh, darling, darling...
6957019 6958611 Please don't go on with this.
6958687 6962316 Leave us some dignity to remember<br />out of our marriage. Spare us this last.
6962391 6963517 This last?
6963892 6965587 Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.
6965661 6969529 I must have loved you for years, only I was<br />such a stupid fool I didn't know it.
6969598 6971930 Please believe me. You must care.
6972467 6974162 Melly said you did.
6974369 6976894 I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?
6978040 6980201 I never really loved Ashley.
6980842 6984437 You certainly gave a good imitation of it,<br />up till this morning.
6985380 6987610 No, Scarlett. I tried everything.
6987983 6991009 If you'd only met me halfway,<br />even when I came back from London.
6991086 6994749 I was so glad to see you.<br />I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
6994856 6998087 And then, when you were sick<br />and it was all my fault...
6998160 7000993 I hoped against hope<br />that you'd call for me, but you didn't.
7001063 7005363 I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,<br />but I didn't think you wanted me.
7006868 7010895 It seems we've been at cross-purposes,<br />doesn't it? But it's no use now.
7011907 7015536 As long as there was Bonnie,<br />there was a chance we might be happy.
7015611 7017340 I liked to think that Bonnie was you.
7017412 7021212 A little girl again, before the war<br />and poverty had done things to you.
7021917 7026445 She was so like you, and I could pet her<br />and spoil her as I wanted to spoil you.
7028490 7030856 But when she went, she took everything.
7030926 7032086 Oh, Rhett!
7032561 7034392 Rhett, please don't say that.
7034463 7037626 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.
7039401 7041801 My darling, you're such a child.
7041970 7045997 You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"<br />all the past can be corrected.
7048677 7050975 Here, take my handkerchief.
7051246 7055239 Never at any crisis of your life<br />have I known you to have a handkerchief.
7059621 7062249 Rhett, where are you going?
7062324 7064656 I'm going to Charleston.<br />Back where I belong.
7064726 7067092 Please. Please take me with you.
7067729 7070254 No. I'm through with everything here.
7071066 7072590 I want peace.
7072734 7077068 I want to see if somewhere there isn't<br />something left in life of charm and grace.
7077806 7081970 - Do you know what I'm talking about?<br />- No. I only know that I love you.
7082044 7083671 That's your misfortune.
7083745 7085007 Oh, Rhett.
7090252 7091344 Rhett!
7097626 7098718 Rhett!
7098827 7101796 If you go, where shall I go?<br />What shall I do?
7103065 7105727 Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
7119281 7121715 Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!
7122584 7125178 There must be some way<br />to bring him back.
7127923 7131120 I can't think about this now.<br />I'll go crazy if I do!
7132894 7135089 I'll think about it tomorrow.
7149378 7151437 But I must think about it.
7152247 7154010 I must think about it.
7155083 7156744 What is there to do?
7157919 7159944 What is there that matters?
7163125 7165320 <i>Do you mean to tell me,<br />Katie Scarlett O'Hara...</i>
