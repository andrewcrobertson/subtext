25367 26857 Big Sam!
27603 29571 Big Sam! Big Sam!
30673 33005 Almighty Moses, it's Miss Scarlett!
33142 34302 Big Sam!
34944 35933 Big Sam!
36011 39378 Sam, 'Lige, 'Postel, Prophet!<br />I'm so glad to see you!
39648 42276 Tell me about Tara, about my mother.<br />She didn't write me.
42351 44478 - She's gone and got sick, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Sick?
44553 46453 Just a little bit sick, that's all.
46522 49548 Your pa was wild when they wouldn't<br />let him fight 'cause of his broken knee.
49625 53584 He had fits when they took us field hands<br />to dig ditches for white soldiers to hide in.
53662 55755 But your ma says<br />the Confederacy needs us.
55831 57162 So we're gonna dig for the South.
57233 58393 Sam, was there a doctor?
58467 59661 Sorry, ma'am, we've got to march.
59735 62499 Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
62571 66166 Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.<br />If any of you get sick or hurt, let me know.
66242 67766 - Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Goodbye.
67843 69333 - Goodbye.<br />- Goodbye.
89732 90892 Scarlett!
91066 92124 Scarlett!
95784 98844 Climb into this buggy.<br />This is no day for walking.
98920 100012 You'll get run over.
100088 101316 Oh, Rhett!
101923 104153 Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
105727 107592 Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
110966 113560 That's just another of General Sherman's<br />calling cards.
113635 114897 He'll be paying us a visit soon.
114970 117700 I've gotta get out of here<br />before the Yankees come!
117873 119636 And leave your work at the hospital?
119708 123474 Or have you had enough of death and lice<br />and men chopped up?
123745 126043 I suppose you weren't meant<br />for sick men, Scarlett.
126114 128139 Don't talk to me like that. I'm so scared.
128216 129979 I wish I could get out of here.
130519 131952 Let's get out of here together.
132020 134989 No use staying here and letting the South<br />come down around your ears.
135056 137524 There are too many nice places<br />to go and visit.
138026 140017 Mexico, London, Paris...
140228 141855 - With you?<br />- Yes, ma'am.
142564 145965 With a man who understands you<br />and admires you for just what you are.
146034 149128 I figure we belong together,<br />being the same sort.
149437 153874 I've been waiting for you to grow up and<br />get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.
154142 157771 Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have<br />a baby in another month or so.
158780 162216 It'll be hard loving a man<br />with a wife and baby clinging to him.
165020 169081 Well, here we are. Are you going with me,<br />or are you getting out?
169357 174192 I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler,<br />and I'll hate and despise you till I die.
175030 177692 Oh no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long.
185273 186797 Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
186875 190572 Folks is all goin' to Macon<br />and folks is runnin' away and runnin' away.
190812 193975 I can't bear it!<br />Those cannon balls right in my ears!
194249 196342 I faint every time I hear one!
197419 199683 Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk!
199788 201050 But, Aunt Pitty, you aren't leaving?
201122 203454 I may be a coward, but oh dear!
204192 206126 Yankees in Georgia!
206494 207722 How did they ever get in?
207796 210458 I'm going, too. Prissy, go pack my things.<br />Get them, quick!
210532 212227 Wait, Aunt Pitty, I won't take a minute.
212300 214029 Scarlett, do you really think you ought to?
214102 215194 Scarlett!
215470 218439 What is this?<br />You ain't planning on running away?
218506 221805 And don't you dare try to stop me.<br />I'm never going back to that hospital.
221876 224811 I've had enough of smelling death<br />and rot and death.
224980 228074 I'm going home. I want my mother.<br />My mother needs me.
228316 231012 Now you've got to listen to me.<br />You must stay here!
231086 234078 Without a chaperon, Dr. Meade?<br />It simply isn't done!
234155 236851 Good heavens, woman, this is war,<br />not a garden party!
236925 238517 You've got to stay. Melanie needs you.
238593 239617 Oh, bother Melanie.
239694 242128 She's ill already.<br />She shouldn't even be having a baby.
242197 243323 She may have a difficult time.
243398 244763 Well, can't we take her along?
244899 246196 Do you want her to take that chance?
246267 247996 Do you want her to be jounced<br />over rough roads...
248069 249832 ...and have her baby ahead of time,<br />in a buggy?
249904 251701 It isn't my baby! You take care of her!
251773 253798 Scarlett! We haven't enough doctors...
253875 256173 ...much less nurses<br />to look after a sick woman.
256244 257677 You've got to stay for Melanie.
257746 258678 What for?
258747 260681 I don't know anything about babies<br />being born!
260749 262307 I knows, I knows.
262517 265145 I knows how to do it.<br />I's done it lots and lots.
265387 268220 Let me, Doctor, let me. I can do everythin'.
268456 271448 - Good. Then I'll rely on you to help us.<br />- Yes, Doctor.
271526 274552 Ashley's fighting in the field,<br />fighting for the cause.
274829 277354 He may never come back. He may die.
278033 280558 Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.
281336 282303 Ashley.
282404 284929 If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
285240 286832 I promised Ashley...
287108 288040 ...something.
288109 289633 Then you'll stay?
290045 293071 Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.<br />Scarlett's staying.
293214 296411 Go on, Uncle Peter.<br />Oh dear, I don't know what to do.
296685 298915 It's like the end of the world.
299921 303049 Uncle Peter, my smelling salts.
310231 312529 Melanie, it's all your fault!
312901 315028 I hate you, I hate you!
315103 316365 And I hate your baby!
316838 318806 If only I hadn't promised Ashley!
319240 321265 If only I hadn't promised him!
350538 352938 Stop! Stop, please stop!
353341 354968 Is it true? Are the Yankees coming?
355043 356772 I'm afraid so, ma'am.<br />The Army's pullin' out.
356845 359040 Pulling out of Atlanta?<br />Leaving us to the Yankees?
359114 360479 Not leavin', ma'am, evacuatin'.
360548 363608 We've got to before Sherman cuts<br />the McDonough Road and catches us.
363685 366813 It can't be true! It can't be true!<br />What'll I do?
366888 370221 Better refugee south right quick, ma'am.<br />If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
371693 372682 Prissy!
373928 375759 Prissy, come here!
375830 379061 Go pack my things and Miss Melanie's too.<br />We're going to Tara right away.
379134 380101 The Yankees are coming!
380201 381395 Yes, ma'am.
383004 384028 Scarlett!
384539 385563 Scarlett!
386274 388333 Melly, we're going to...
390445 391412 Melly!
394048 397506 I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.
399954 402184 It began at daybreak.
402724 403952 But, but...
405026 406891 But the Yankees are coming.
408296 409593 Poor Scarlett.
410331 413459 You'd be at Tara now with your mother,<br />wouldn't you...
414235 415725 ...if it weren't for me?
416738 418569 Oh, Scarlett, darling...
418907 420807 ...you've been so good to me.
420909 423377 No sister could have been sweeter.
426447 428779 I've been lying here thinking...
429617 431312 ...if I should die...
432453 434478 ...will you take my baby?
436624 438649 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
438993 441928 Aren't things bad enough<br />without you talking about dying?
442096 444997 - I'll send for Dr. Meade right now.<br />- Not yet, Scarlett.
445233 447793 I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here<br />for hours, while...
448903 452805 ...while all those poor, wounded boys...<br />- Melly, Prissy!
454008 455999 Prissy! Prissy! Come here, quick!
456477 457944 Go get Dr. Meade! Run quick!
458012 460378 Yes, ma'am. The baby!
460982 464474 Well, don't stand there like a scared goat.<br />Run!
465854 469847 Hurry! I'll sell you South, I will!<br />I swear I will!
471693 473456 Where's that Prissy?
476064 478089 This room's like an oven already...
478433 480367 ...and it isn't noon yet.
483204 485001 Oh, don't worry, Melly.
485607 489270 Mother says it always seems<br />like the doctor'll never come.
490645 492875 If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
500455 501683 Oh, Melly.
502390 504984 You know what I heard<br />about Maybelle Merriwether?
505059 507254 You remember that funny-looking beau<br />of hers?
507328 510491 The one with a uniform<br />like ladies' red flannel underdrawers.
510732 514259 You don't have to keep on talking<br />for my sake, Scarlett.
514502 516470 I know how worried you are.
529717 533380 Oh, Melly, I'll just go and fetch you<br />some cooler water.
535089 536579 You're as slow as molasses in January.
536658 537955 And where's Dr. Meade?
538159 540593 - I ain't never seen him, Miss Scarlett.<br />- What?
540662 543028 No, ma'am. He ain't at the hospital.
543097 547966 A man, he told me the doctor's down<br />at the car shed with the wounded soldiers...
548136 550502 Well, why didn't you go after him?
550772 551966 Miss Scarlett.
552140 555041 I's scared to go down there to the car shed.
555476 559412 There's folks dyin' down there<br />and I's scared of dead folks.
561549 563141 Oh, you go sit by Miss Melly.
563318 566446 And don't you be upsetting her,<br />or I'll whip the hide off you!
605026 607620 - Have you seen Dr. Meade?<br />- One side, lady, please.
611566 612897 Dr. Meade!
657545 658876 Dr. Meade! At last!
659414 662611 Oh, thank heavens you're here.<br />I need every pair of hands.
662784 665844 Come, child! Wake up!<br />We've got work to do.
666054 669353 But Melly's having her baby.<br />You've got to come with me!
669690 672352 Are you crazy?<br />I can't leave these men for a baby!
672627 675460 They're dyin', hundreds of them!<br />Get some woman to help you.
675530 678624 But there isn't anybody.<br />And, Dr. Meade, she might die!
678800 679767 Die!
679834 682564 Look at them!<br />Bleeding to death in front of my eyes!
682837 687035 No chloroform! No bandages!<br />Nothing! Nothing to even ease their pain!
687475 689636 Now run along and don't bother me.
689911 693039 Now don't worry, child.<br />There's nothing to bringing a baby.
693381 694780 Now bring those stretchers in here!
694849 695781 Dr. Meade!
695850 697408 Here. I'm coming.
716671 718229 Is the doctor come?
718873 720135 No, he can't come.
720374 723172 Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.
723311 725905 He can't come. There's nobody to come.
726614 729913 Prissy, you've got to manage<br />without the doctor. I'll help you.
730218 732015 Oh, lordy, Miss Scarlett.
733221 734347 Well, what is it?
734589 736853 Lordy, we've got to have a doctor.
736924 739051 I don't know nothin' about birthin' babies.
741095 742926 - What do you mean?<br />- I don't know...
742997 744760 You told me you knew everything about it.
744832 746959 I don't know how come I tell such a lie.
747034 750731 Ma ain't never let me 'round<br />when folks was havin' them.
750938 752030 Scarlett!
752673 753799 Scarlett!
754509 756306 Oh, Miss Scarlett...
756978 758741 Stop it!
759714 761181 Go light a fire in the stove!
761249 764218 Keep boiling water in the kettle,<br />get me a ball of twine and...
764285 766685 ...and all the clean towels you can find,<br />and the scissors.
766754 768449 Don't come telling me you can't find them.
768523 770684 Go get them, and get them quick!
772126 773184 Scarlett!
782637 783968 Coming, Melly.
785072 786130 Coming.
790111 792409 Go, Scarlett, before the Yankees get here.
792480 794471 I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.
794549 796244 It's no use. I'm going to die.
796317 799309 Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me.<br />Hold on to me.
799587 801782 Talk to me, Scarlett.
801856 803983 Please talk to me.
804225 805453 Don't try to be brave, Melly.
805526 807790 Yell all you want to,<br />there's nobody to hear.
807995 812432 Ma says that if you puts a knife<br />under the bed it cuts the pain in two.
817738 819501 Cap'n Butler!
820374 821671 Cap'n Butler!
823444 824468 What do you want?
824545 825512 Cap'n Butler.
825580 828242 He's upstairs. Belle Watlin's givin' a party.
830518 831712 Thank you.
834055 836489 Cap'n Butler! Oh, Cap'n Butler!
836724 838783 What's all the rumpus about?
838960 842157 I's got a message for Cap'n Butler,<br />Miss Watlin'!
842363 845355 Cap'n Butler, you come out here<br />in the streets to me.
847168 848135 What is it, Prissy?
848202 850693 Miss Scarlett, she done sent me for you.
850871 853601 Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.
854108 857009 And a fine baby boy...
857478 860242 ...and Miss Scarlett and me, we brung him.
860448 861779 Do you mean to tell me that Scarlett...
861849 865649 Well, it was mostly me, Cap'n Butler,<br />only Miss Scarlett...
865720 870589 ...she helped me a little, but I don't expect<br />no doctor could have done no better!
870891 875021 Only Miss Melly, she feelin' kinda poorly<br />now it's all over!
876197 877459 Yes, I can believe that!
877531 881126 And the Yankees is comin'<br />and Miss Scarlett she said...
882436 885166 Oh, Cap'n Butler, the Yankees is here!
885840 889105 Please come and bring your carriage<br />for us right away.
889243 892303 I'm sorry, Prissy, but the Army took<br />my horse and carriage.
892513 894447 You'd better come upstairs.<br />I'll see what I can do.
894515 896073 Oh, no, Cap'n Butler!
896350 901151 My ma would wear me out with a cornstalk<br />if I was to go into Miss Watlin's.
902256 905885 Any of you beauties know where I can steal<br />a horse for a good cause?
912800 915633 - Whoa, Marse Robert.<br />- Is that you, Rhett?
915903 919134 - We's here, Miss Scarlett. We's here!<br />- Rhett, I knew you'd come.
919206 921003 Good evening. Nice weather we're having.
921075 922372 Prissy tells me you're planning<br />on taking a trip.
922443 924934 If you make any jokes now I'll kill you!
925246 926338 Don't tell me you're frightened.
926414 930009 I'm scared to death. If you had the sense<br />of a goat, you'd be scared too.
930685 931777 Oh, the Yankees.
931852 932819 No, not yet.
932887 935219 That's what's left of our Army,<br />blowing up the ammunition...
935289 936347 ...so the Yankees won't get it.
936424 938449 We've got to get out of here.
938526 939515 At your service, Madam.
939593 941083 Just where are you figuring on going?
941162 942186 Home, to Tara.
942263 944857 Don't you know that they've been fighting<br />all day around Tara?
944932 946832 Do you think you can parade through<br />the Yankee Army...
946901 949631 ...with a sick woman,<br />a baby and a simple-minded darky...
949704 951365 ...or do you intend leaving them behind?
951439 953600 They're going with me and I'm going home<br />and you can't stop me!
953674 957667 Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing<br />Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?
957745 959178 I want my mother!
960281 962408 I want to go home to Tara!
962483 964041 Tara's probably been burned to the ground.
964118 965745 The woods are full of stragglers<br />from both armies.
965820 967947 The least they'll do is take the horse<br />away from you...
968022 969421 ...and even though it isn't<br />much of an animal...
969490 970923 ...I did have a lot of trouble stealing it.
970991 974427 I'm going home if I have to walk<br />every step of the way.
974495 977692 I'll kill you if you try to stop me.<br />I will, I will!
978199 979291 I will!
985106 988633 All right, darling, all right.<br />Now you shall go home.
990511 993969 I guess anybody who did what you've done<br />today can take care of Sherman.
995583 997915 Here, now. Stop crying.
1000421 1002719 Now blow your nose like a good little girl.
1002990 1003979 There.
1015870 1016962 <i>Prissy! What are you doing?</i>
1017037 1018470 I's packin', Miss Scarlett.
1018539 1020006 <i>Stop it and come get the baby.</i>
1020207 1021196 Yes, ma'am.
1023844 1024970 Melly!
1025980 1028813 Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.
1029216 1030114 Tara...
1030184 1032049 - It's the only way, Melly.<br />- No.
1032119 1034849 Sherman will burn the house<br />over our heads if we stay.
1035122 1036555 It's all right, Melly.
1036624 1038182 My baby.
1038793 1040317 My poor baby.
1044999 1047092 Have you the strength to put your arms<br />around my neck?
1047168 1048931 I think so.
1051939 1053065 Never mind.
1053274 1055640 Oh, Ashley, Charles...
1055709 1057301 What is it? What does she want?
1057378 1060142 Ashley's picture, Charles' sword.<br />She wants us to bring them.
1060214 1061181 Get them.
1077264 1078322 What's that?
1078899 1082130 Our gallant lads must have set fire<br />to the warehouses near the depot.
1082203 1084797 There's enough ammunition in the box cars<br />to blow us to Tara.
1084872 1086601 We'll have to hurry to get<br />across the tracks.
1086674 1088539 - You're not going that way!<br />- We have to.
1088609 1091772 The McDonough Road's the only one<br />the Yankees haven't cut yet.
1101121 1103555 Oh, wait. I forgot to lock the front door.
1103691 1104988 What are you laughing at?
1105059 1107186 At you, locking the Yankees out.
1124245 1125872 Oh, dear, I wish they'd hurry.
1125946 1128676 I wouldn't be in such a hurry<br />to see them go if I were you.
1128749 1131217 With them goes the last semblance<br />of law and order.
1133587 1135748 The scavengers aren't wasting any time.
1140227 1141956 We've got to get out of here, fast.
1142029 1143257 There's a horse!
1154742 1156403 Down the alley, cut them off.
1170391 1172086 Give me that horse.
1182269 1183258 Miss Scarlett!
1188208 1190142 They haven't left much for the Yankees<br />to take, have they?
1190210 1193509 We'll have to make a dash for it<br />before the fire reaches that ammunition.
1215069 1216036 Come on!
1220541 1222202 Throw me your shawl.
1224878 1228075 Sorry, but you'll like it better<br />if you don't see anything.
1287808 1289799 Take a good look, my dear.
1290244 1291268 It's a historic moment.
1291345 1295338 You can tell your grandchildren how you<br />watched the old South disappear one night.
1312466 1314798 They were going to lick the Yankees<br />in a month.
1314935 1316732 The poor gallant fools!
1316837 1318202 They make me sick, all of them!
1318272 1321400 Getting us all into this<br />with their swaggering and boasting.
1321742 1325075 That's the way I felt once<br />about their swaggering and boasting.
1325946 1328312 Rhett, I'm so glad you aren't<br />with the Army.
1328382 1332785 You can be proud, now, proud that you've<br />been smarter than all of them.
1335055 1336522 I'm not so proud.
1355976 1357034 Why did you stop?
1357111 1359841 This is the turn to Tara.<br />Let the horse breathe a bit.
1360214 1361181 Mrs. Wilkes.
1361315 1364614 Miss Melly done fainted way back,<br />Cap'n Butler.
1364818 1366376 Well, she's probably better off.
1366453 1369513 She couldn't stand the pain<br />if she were conscious.
1370023 1372890 Scarlett, are you still determined to do<br />this crazy thing?
1372960 1375793 Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.<br />I'm sure we can.
1375863 1377694 Not we, my dear, you.
1378065 1379532 I'm leaving you here.
1379833 1382427 You're what? Rhett, where are you going?
1382669 1384899 I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.
1385105 1387733 You're joking!<br />I could kill you for scaring me so!
1387808 1389400 I'm very serious, Scarlett.
1389610 1392101 I'm going to join up<br />with our brave lads in gray.
1392412 1393538 But they're running away!
1393614 1397072 No. They'll turn and make a last stand,<br />if I know anything about them.
1397151 1399813 When they do, I'll be with them.<br />A little late, but "Better late..."
1399887 1401616 Rhett, you must be joking!
1403023 1404581 Selfish to the end, aren't you?
1404758 1408387 Thinking only of your own precious hide,<br />with never a thought for the noble cause.
1408462 1410293 Rhett, how could you do this to me...
1410364 1413299 ...and why should you go now,<br />after it's all over and I need you?
1413367 1414391 Why? Why?
1414468 1415435 Why?
1415502 1418062 Maybe it's because I've always had<br />a weakness for lost causes...
1418138 1419696 ...once they're really lost.
1419973 1421065 Or maybe...
1422309 1424334 ...maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
1425579 1426546 Who knows?
1426647 1429514 You should die of shame<br />to leave me here alone and helpless!
1429817 1430875 You helpless?
1432352 1435116 Heaven help the Yankees<br />if they capture you!
1435656 1438716 Now, climb down here.<br />I want to say goodbye.
1439059 1440048 No!
1440661 1441719 Climb down.
1445399 1448562 Oh, Rhett, please don't go.<br />You can't leave me, please.
1448802 1450531 I'll never forgive you!
1450604 1454404 I'm not asking you to forgive me.<br />I'll never understand or forgive myself.
1454708 1459145 And if a bullet gets me, so help me,<br />I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
1459379 1461279 But there's one thing I do know...
1461348 1463009 ...and that is that I love you, Scarlett.
1463083 1466075 In spite of you and me and the whole<br />silly world going to pieces around us...
1466153 1467381 ...I love you...
1467487 1470012 ...because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.
1470424 1471891 Selfish and shrewd...
1472726 1475786 ...but able to look things in the eyes<br />and call them by their right names.
1475863 1477763 Don't hold me like that!
1477998 1479829 Scarlett, look at me.
1481001 1483435 I love you more<br />than I've ever loved any woman.
1483570 1486801 And I've waited longer for you<br />than I've ever waited for any woman.
1486874 1488068 Let me alone!
1489443 1491809 Here's a soldier of the South<br />who loves you, Scarlett...
1491879 1493369 ...wants to feel your arms around him...
1493447 1496348 ...wants to carry the memory<br />of your kisses into battle with him.
1496416 1497940 Never mind about loving me.
1498185 1501951 You're a woman sending a soldier<br />to his death with a beautiful memory.
1502222 1504019 Scarlett, kiss me.
1505158 1506523 Kiss me, once.
1511865 1514333 You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!
1514635 1517968 They were right! Everybody was right!<br />You aren't a gentleman!
1521141 1523302 A minor point at such a moment.
1525178 1526270 Here.
1526914 1529212 If anyone lays a hand on that nag,<br />shoot him.
1529283 1531217 But don't make a mistake<br />and shoot the nag.
1531285 1535415 Oh, go on. I want you to go.<br />I hope a cannon ball lands slap on you.
1535489 1537013 I hope you're blown into a million pieces!
1537090 1540253 Never mind the rest.<br />I follow your general idea.
1540327 1542420 And when I'm dead on the altar<br />of my country...
1542496 1544828 ...I hope your conscience hurts you.
1545399 1546832 Goodbye, Scarlett.
1572859 1575453 Come on, you! We're going home.
1651204 1653195 Oh, my poor baby.
1655108 1656541 Don't worry, Melly.
1656843 1658902 Mother'll take care of him<br />when we get home.
1658979 1661777 Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.
1662015 1663812 We's got to have something to eat.
1663884 1664908 Oh, hush up!
1665485 1668477 We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.<br />We'll stop there.
1669322 1670289 Go on!
1737591 1740583 Ashley, I'm glad you're not here to see this.
1741895 1743590 The Yankees!
1743663 1745597 The dirty Yankees!
1760247 1762738 Prissy, come tie up this cow!
1763250 1765616 We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
1765685 1768745 We'll be home soon, and I's scared of cows.
1769356 1772382 Tear up your petticoat and tie her<br />on to the back of the wagon.
1772626 1776255 We need milk for the baby, and<br />we don't know what we'll find at home.
1785505 1787496 Melly! Melly, we're home!
1787707 1788731 We're at Tara!
1788808 1790673 Hurry! Move, you brute!
1792279 1794713 Miss Scarlett, he's dead!
1795015 1799281 I can't see the house! Is it there?<br />I can't see the house. Have they burned it?
1803190 1804817 Oh, it's all right.
1804891 1807223 It's all right! They haven't burned it!
1807561 1808892 It's still there!
1812566 1815126 Mother! Mother! Pa!
1817871 1819532 Mother! Mother! Pa!
1825378 1828313 Mother, let me in. It's me, Scarlett!
1832819 1833786 Pa!
1834554 1836021 Oh, Pa!
1836756 1838087 I'm home!
1839593 1840685 I'm home!
1843763 1845162 Katie.
1845932 1847456 Katie Scarlett.
1848435 1850232 Oh, darlin'.
1861414 1862381 Mammy!
1863683 1867119 - Mammy, I'm home.<br />- Honey, honey child!
1868922 1871015 Oh, Mammy, I'm so...
1872692 1873750 Where's Mother?
1874728 1875695 Why...
1876329 1879924 ...Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen,<br />they was sick with the typhoid.
1880667 1883500 They had it bad,<br />but they's doin' all right now.
1883837 1885304 Just weak like little kittens.
1885372 1887340 But where's Mother?
1889042 1890168 Well...
1890744 1895647 ...Miss Ellen, she went down to nurse<br />that Emmy Slattery, that white trash...
1896349 1898374 ...and she took down with it, too.
1900720 1902881 - And last night she...<br />- Mother!
1906760 1907988 Mother.
1975929 1977226 Miss Scarlett, honey.
1977464 1980194 If there's anythin' I can do,<br />Miss Scarlett...
1981067 1982694 What did you do with Miss Melly?
1982769 1985101 Don't you worry your pretty head<br />'bout Miss Melly, child.
1985171 1988038 I done slapped her in bed already,<br />along with the baby.
1988241 1990709 You better put that cow I brought<br />into the barn, Pork.
1990777 1993075 There ain't no barn no more, Miss Scarlett.
1993179 1995113 The Yankees done burned it for firewood.
1995181 1997308 They used the house for their headquarters.
1997384 1999045 They camped all around the place.
1999119 2000347 Yankees in Tara!
2000653 2003451 Yes, ma'am, and they stole most everythin'<br />they didn't burn.
2003656 2007717 All the clothes and all the rugs<br />and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
2010063 2011928 I'm starving, Pork.<br />Get me something to eat.
2011998 2015195 There ain't nothin' to eat, honey.<br />They took it all.
2015535 2017093 All the chickens, everything?
2017237 2018864 They took them the first thing.
2019139 2021937 And what they didn't eat<br />they carried off across their saddles.
2022008 2024772 Don't tell me any more<br />about what they did!
2040660 2042651 What's this, Pa?
2042729 2043821 Whiskey?
2044297 2045559 Yes, daughter.
2049436 2051461 Here, Katie Scarlett, that's enough!
2051805 2054933 You're not knowing spirits,<br />you'll make yourself tipsy.
2055141 2057041 I hope it makes me drunk.
2057410 2059002 I'd like to be drunk.
2062148 2063137 Oh, Pa.
2066719 2068050 What are those papers?
2069522 2070648 Bonds.
2072425 2074052 They're all we've saved.
2074294 2075886 All we have left.
2076429 2077623 Bonds.
2078031 2079760 What kind of bonds, Pa?
2080834 2083394 Why, Confederate bonds,<br />of course, daughter.
2083570 2084901 Confederate bonds?
2085538 2087267 What good are they to anybody?
2087941 2090603 I'll not have you talking like that,<br />Katie Scarlett.
2090810 2094871 Oh, Pa, what are we going to do<br />with no money and nothing to eat?
2096349 2097907 We must ask your mother.
2099052 2100383 That's it!
2100820 2103050 We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
2104557 2106286 - Ask Mother?<br />- Yes.
2107193 2109753 Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.
2110864 2112627 Now don't be botherin' me.
2112832 2114595 Go out for a ride.
2115235 2116293 I'm busy.
2134487 2136045 Oh, Pa...
2136789 2138518 ...don't worry about anything.
2139692 2141091 Katie Scarlett's home.
2143963 2145191 You needn't worry.
2160813 2161780 Miss Scarlett.
2161848 2165784 What are we gonna to do with nothin'<br />to feed those sick folks and that child?
2167320 2168912 I don't know, Mammy.
2169756 2170882 I don't know.
2170957 2173892 We ain't got nothin' but radishes<br />in the garden.
2174093 2177028 Miss Scarlett,<br />Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...
2177230 2179596 ...they's fussin' to be sponged off.
2180400 2181833 Where are the other servants, Mammy?
2181901 2184495 Miss Scarlett, there's only<br />just me and Pork left.
2184571 2186835 The others went off to the war<br />or runned away.
2186906 2190137 I can't take care of that baby<br />and sick folks, too.
2191010 2192773 I's only got two hands.
2193212 2197581 Who's going to milk that cow,<br />Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.
2280600 2282363 As God is my witness...
2283169 2286605 As God is my witness,<br />they're not going to lick me.
2286906 2291775 I'm going to live through this, and when<br />it's all over, I'll never be hungry again.
2292145 2293806 No, nor any of my folks.
2295381 2297941 If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill.
2299252 2303120 As God is my witness,<br />I'll never be hungry again!
2743167 2745260 My back's near broken.
2747872 2749601 Look at my hands.
2750307 2753470 Mother said you could always tell a lady<br />by her hands.
2753944 2757880 I guess things like hands and ladies<br />don't matter so much anymore.
2758749 2762549 You rest, Sue, you're not well yet,<br />and I can pick cotton for both of us.
2762753 2766348 Scarlett's hateful, making us work<br />in the fields like...
2766457 2768186 Too bad about that.
2768659 2771526 Now get back to work.<br />I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.
2771595 2774189 What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!
2777635 2780570 Don't you ever dare say<br />you hate Tara again!
2781438 2783804 The same as hating Pa and Ma.
2791115 2793777 Katie Scarlett, there's something<br />I must speak to you about.
2793851 2794818 Yes, Pa, what is it?
2794885 2798514 I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.<br />I don't like the way you're treating them.
2798589 2801990 You must be firm with inferiors<br />but you must be gentle with them...
2802159 2803592 ...especially darkies.
2803661 2807529 Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them<br />to do anything I'm not doing myself.
2807598 2811932 Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett,<br />I don't like it. I shall speak to<br />Mrs. O'Hara about it.
2827151 2828675 What are you doing out of bed, Melly?
2828752 2831949 Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.<br />You are all working so hard.
2832022 2833717 I can't lie in bed doing nothing.
2833791 2836316 Go on back upstairs.<br />You're as weak as a newborn colt.
2836393 2837655 Please, Scarlett, let me.
2837728 2839855 Stop being noble.<br />I've got enough on my hands...
2839930 2842797 ...without you making yourself sick<br />so you'll never be any use.
2843067 2845592 Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
2901292 2903886 Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot!
2910200 2912134 You all alone, little lady?
2914972 2917338 You ain't very friendly, are you?
2920344 2923142 You got anything else<br />besides these earbobs?
2923213 2925738 You Yankees have been here before.
2925916 2928544 Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
2929586 2932054 What have you got hidden in your hand?
2967558 2969526 Scarlett, you killed him!
2970694 2972559 I'm glad you killed him!
2973731 2977132 <i>Scarlett! Scarlett, what happened?<br />What is it, Scarlett? What is it?</i>
2981538 2984666 Don't be scared, chickens.<br />Your sister was cleaning a revolver and...
2984742 2987210 ...it went off and nearly scared her<br />to death.
2987478 2990606 Oh, thank goodness.<br />Haven't we got enough to frighten us?
2990781 2993341 Tell Katie Scarlett<br />she must be more careful.
2996553 2998851 What a cool liar you are, Melly.
2999490 3001754 We've got to get him out of here<br />and bury him.
3001825 3003486 If the Yankees find him here, they'll...
3003560 3006996 I didn't see anyone else.<br />I think he must be a deserter.
3007064 3008691 But, even so, we've got to hide him.
3008766 3012532 They might hear about it,<br />and then they'd come and get you.
3015439 3018067 I could bury him in the arbor<br />where the ground is soft...
3018142 3020610 ...but how will I get him out of here?
3021311 3022869 We'll both take a leg and drag him.
3022946 3024709 You couldn't drag a cat.
3031522 3034855 Do you think it would be dishonest<br />if we went through his haversack?
3034925 3037086 I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
3037461 3040294 You take the haversack,<br />I'll search his pockets.
3052509 3053567 You look.
3054178 3055736 I'm feeling a little weak.
3056013 3058607 Melly, I think it's full of money!
3059450 3061042 Oh, Melly, look!
3061118 3062142 Look!
3062853 3063945 Ten, $20, $30, $40...
3064021 3066182 Don't stop to count it now.<br />We haven't got time.
3066423 3068653 Do you realize this means<br />we'll have something to eat?
3068725 3070556 Look in his other pockets.
3072663 3074096 Hurry, hurry!
3074298 3076664 - We've got to get him out of here.<br />- Here.
3089947 3092279 If he bleeds across the yard,<br />we can't hide it.
3092916 3095885 Give me your nightgown, Melly.<br />I'll wad it around his head.
3095953 3097545 Don't be silly. I won't look at you.
3097621 3100283 If I had a petticoat or pantalettes,<br />I'd use them.
3114538 3116836 Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
3117841 3120275 Now go back to bed.<br />You'll be dead if you don't.
3120444 3122605 I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him.
3123180 3125341 No, I'll clean it up.
3128719 3130482 Well, I guess I've done murder.
3132589 3134614 I won't think about that now.
3135092 3137219 I'll think about that tomorrow.
3146370 3147530 Katie Scarlett!
3148839 3150033 Katie Scarlett!
3150641 3152472 It's over! It's over!
3153544 3155409 It's all over! The war!
3155479 3156878 Lee surrendered!
3157080 3159412 - It's not possible.<br />- Oh, why did we ever fight?
3159750 3161513 Ashley will be coming home.
3161885 3163614 Yes, Ashley'll be coming home.
3164187 3165814 We'll plant more cotton.
3165889 3168016 Cotton ought to go sky-high next year!
3183540 3186509 "While we were marching through Georgia.
3186777 3188438 "Hurrah, hurrah!
3188512 3190173 "We bring the jubilee.
3190247 3191805 "Hurrah, hurrah!
3191882 3193577 "The flag that makes you free.
3193784 3196810 "So we sing the chorus<br />from Atlanta to the sea.
3197120 3200612 "While we were marching<br />through Georgia."
3200857 3203052 Get out of the road, rebel!<br />Get out of the way!
3203126 3205287 Have you room in your carriage<br />for a dyin' man?
3205362 3208058 I got no room for any Southern scum,<br />alive or dead.
3208131 3209325 Get out of the way!
3209600 3211932 I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.
3212202 3214830 Giddap! Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
3214972 3217270 Act like they won the war!
3217541 3220271 Now you come on and give me them pants,<br />Mist' Kennedy.
3220344 3221402 Come on.
3223680 3227138 You scrub yourself with that strong<br />lye soap before I scrubs you myself.
3227284 3230344 I'm gonna put these britches<br />in the boilin' pot.
3233056 3235490 The whole Confederate Army's got<br />the same trouble...
3235559 3237618 ...crawlin' clothes and dysentery.
3238528 3240428 It's humiliating how you treat Mr. Kennedy.
3240497 3244092 You'd be a sight more humiliated<br />if Mist' Kennedy's lice gets on you!
3246370 3247632 Come on, Beau.
3247804 3251535 We must leave this gentleman alone<br />because he's tired and he's hungry.
3252476 3255172 I don't mind, ma'am.<br />Good to see a youngster again.
3255412 3256674 Nice little fellow.
3256880 3260611 Another two years of war and we could<br />have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.
3261485 3262975 Were you in Cobb's Legion?
3263053 3264281 Yes, ma'am.
3264421 3267652 Why, then, you must know my husband,<br />Major Wilkes.
3267724 3269021 Oh, yes, ma'am.
3269259 3271523 He was captured at Spottsylvania, I think.
3271795 3273023 Captured!
3273897 3275831 Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't...
3276233 3278428 Oh, my poor Ashley! In a Yankee prison!
3278969 3280197 Melanie!
3280370 3283168 Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.<br />Come along, Beau.
3283407 3285466 I'll watch out for him, ma'am.<br />We're good friends.
3285542 3287032 Oh, thank you.
3291615 3294880 I slave day and night so we can have<br />food to keep body and soul together.
3294985 3297545 And you give it all away<br />to these starving scarecrows.
3297621 3299452 I'd rather a plague of locusts around here.
3299523 3301491 Don't scold me, Scarlett, please.
3301558 3304152 I've just heard<br />that Ashley was taken prisoner.
3304394 3305952 - Ashley, a prisoner!<br />- Yes.
3306163 3310361 And maybe if he's alive and well<br />he's on some Northern road right now.
3310801 3313964 And maybe some Northern woman<br />is giving him a share of her dinner...
3314037 3317097 ...and helping my beloved<br />to come back home to me.
3319042 3320168 I hope so, Melly.
3320277 3321244 Miss Scarlett.
3325148 3328345 Miss Scarlett, I wanted to take up<br />something with your pa but...
3328652 3329710 ...he doesn't seem to...
3329786 3332277 Perhaps I can help you.<br />I'm head of the house now.
3332489 3334150 Well, I, I...
3334725 3337353 Miss Scarlett, I was aimin' to ask<br />for Suellen.
3338462 3340692 Do you mean to tell me<br />you haven't asked for her...
3340764 3342959 ...after all these years<br />she's been counting on you?
3343033 3346799 Well, I, the truth is,<br />I'm so much older than she is, and...
3346937 3349064 Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.
3349206 3350400 Who has nowadays?
3351007 3353942 Miss Scarlett, if true love carries<br />any weight with you...
3354010 3356638 ...you can be sure your sister<br />will be rich in that.
3356980 3360279 I'll go out somewhere and get myself<br />a little business if we're engaged.
3360417 3361975 As soon as I get on my feet again...
3362052 3364452 All right, Frank.<br />I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
3364554 3365816 You go ask her now.
3366823 3369155 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
3372395 3374420 Excuse me, excuse me.
3377167 3379931 Scarlett, what seems to be<br />the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
3380203 3382137 More trouble than he guesses.
3382205 3384105 He has finally asked for Suellen's hand.
3384174 3385573 Oh, I'm so glad.
3385842 3390006 It's a pity he can't marry her now.<br />At least, there'd be one less mouth to feed.
3393884 3395408 Oh, another one.
3395986 3397317 I hope this one isn't hungry.
3397387 3398479 He'll be hungry.
3398555 3401183 I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate...
3412836 3413894 Ashley!
3416173 3417435 Ashley!
3419142 3420234 Darling!
3430520 3433216 Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.
3433290 3436054 Turn me loose, you fool!<br />Turn me loose, it's Ashley!
3436259 3438227 He's her husband, ain't he?
3450807 3452866 - Miss Scarlett, ma'am.<br />- High time you got back.
3452943 3455707 - Did you get the horse shod?<br />- Yes, sir. He shod all right.
3455946 3459541 Fine thing when a horse can get shoes<br />and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.
3459616 3461584 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
3461785 3465186 I gotta know how much money<br />have you got left, in gold.
3465422 3467117 Ten dollars. Why?
3468191 3469419 That won't be enough.
3469626 3471685 What in heaven's name are you<br />talking about?
3471761 3475993 Well, Miss Scarlett, I see'd that old,<br />no-count white-trash Wilkerson...
3476066 3478626 ...that used to be<br />Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
3478835 3482236 He's a regular Yankee now,<br />and he was makin' a brag...
3482505 3487442 ...that his carpetbagger friends done run<br />the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
3487844 3489334 But how much more have we got to pay?
3489412 3492575 I hear'd the tax man say $300.
3492649 3493980 Three hundred!
3495552 3497349 Might just as well be $3 million.
3497821 3499550 But we gotta raise it, that's all.
3499623 3500715 Yes, ma'am.
3500891 3501858 How?
3504261 3505489 I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
3505562 3507860 Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.
3507964 3510364 Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?
3512969 3514334 Askin' ain't gettin'.
3523813 3525007 Ashley!
3526349 3528909 They say Abe Lincoln got his start<br />splitting rails.
3529819 3532151 Just think what I may do<br />once I get the knack.
3533690 3536158 The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
3537961 3539553 What shall we do?
3540263 3542060 Ashley, what's to become of us?
3542866 3545528 What becomes of people<br />when their civilization breaks up?
3546536 3549505 Those who have brains and courage<br />come through all right.
3549606 3551130 Those that haven't are winnowed out.
3551207 3554506 For heaven's sake, Ashley,<br />don't stand there talking nonsense at me...
3554577 3556442 ...when it's us who are being<br />winnowed out.
3556513 3557912 You're right, Scarlett.
3558315 3560943 Here I am talking tommy-rot<br />about civilization...
3561484 3563213 ...when your Tara's in danger.
3563753 3566620 You've come to me for help,<br />and I've no help to give you.
3567190 3568487 Oh, Scarlett, I...
3568925 3570222 ...I'm a coward.
3571194 3572752 You, Ashley, a coward?
3573830 3575354 What are you afraid of?
3575699 3579191 Oh, mostly of life becoming<br />too real for me, I suppose.
3580370 3582736 Not that I mind splitting rails...
3583173 3587542 ...but I do mind very much losing<br />the beauty of that life I loved.
3589679 3594173 If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent<br />my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
3594784 3596684 But the war did come.
3596920 3599445 I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
3599656 3602090 I saw men crumple up in agony<br />when I shot them.
3603426 3606759 And now I find myself in a world<br />which for me is worse than death.
3608264 3610425 A world in which there's no place for me.
3612736 3616467 I can never make you understand because<br />you don't know the meaning of fear.
3616706 3618833 You never mind facing realities...
3619943 3622810 ...and you never want to escape<br />from them as I do.
3625448 3626472 Escape?
3627984 3629747 Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.
3630153 3631780 I do want to escape too.
3632422 3636518 I'm so very tired of it all.<br />I've struggled for food and for money.
3636593 3640620 I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton<br />until I can't stand it another minute.
3641064 3643555 I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.<br />It's dead.
3643633 3647330 The Yankees and the carpetbaggers<br />have got it and there's nothing left for us.
3649773 3651070 Oh, Ashley...
3651908 3653535 ...let's run away.
3653610 3654941 We'd go to Mexico.
3655011 3658071 They want officers in the Mexican Army.<br />We could be so happy there.
3658148 3661948 I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.<br />You know you don't love Melanie.
3662018 3664077 You told me you loved me<br />that day at Twelve Oaks.
3664154 3666088 And anyway, Melanie can't...
3666790 3670226 Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have<br />any more children and I could give you...
3670293 3672284 Can't we ever forget<br />that day at Twelve Oaks?
3672362 3674887 Do you think I could ever forget it?<br />Have you forgotten it?
3674964 3677296 Can you honestly say you don't love me?
3678701 3681067 - No. I don't love you.<br />- It's a lie!
3681237 3685298 Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie<br />and the baby, break Melanie's heart?
3685375 3687366 You couldn't leave<br />your father and the girls.
3687444 3689878 I could leave them. I'm sick of them.<br />I'm tired of them.
3689946 3693143 Yes, you're sick and tired.<br />That's why you're talking this way.
3694818 3696979 You've carried the load for all of us...
3697087 3700215 ...but from now on I'm going to be<br />more help to you, I promise.
3700457 3702550 There's only one way you can help me.
3702625 3703887 Take me away.
3704260 3706160 There's nothing to keep us here.
3707564 3708531 Nothing.
3710600 3711999 Nothing except honor.
3724948 3726415 Oh, please, Scarlett.
3726749 3728808 Please, dear, you mustn't cry.
3729185 3730209 You mustn't.
3730320 3732618 Please, my brave dear, you mustn't plead.
3746102 3748161 You do love me, you do love me.
3748438 3750497 - Say it, say it.<br />- Don't, don't.
3750773 3752172 You love me, you love me.
3752242 3754836 We won't do this, I tell you.<br />It won't happen again.
3754978 3756946 I'm going to take Melanie<br />and the baby, and go.
3757013 3758378 Say it, you love me.
3758448 3761940 All right, I'll say it.<br />I love your courage and your stubbornness.
3762152 3765918 So much that I could have forgotten<br />the best wife a man ever had.
3765989 3768457 But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.
3778101 3780092 Then there's nothing left for me.
3781538 3783597 Nothing to fight for.
3784440 3786374 Nothing to live for.
3789078 3790477 Yes, there is something.
3791981 3794040 Something you love better than me...
3794784 3796513 ...though you may not know it.
3802625 3803523 Tara!
3807530 3809088 Yes, I...
3810867 3812391 ...I still have this.
3817540 3818802 You needn't go.
3819742 3823234 I won't have you all starve simply<br />because I threw myself at your head.
3824681 3826148 It won't happen again.
3854477 3856536 - Why, it's Emmy Slattery.<br />- Yes, ma'am, it's me.
3856613 3857580 Stop!
3858348 3861249 You haven't forgotten your old overseer,<br />have you?
3862085 3863882 Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
3864053 3866886 Get off those steps, you trashy wench!<br />Get off this land!
3867390 3868914 You can't speak that way to my wife.
3868992 3871085 Wife! High time you made her your wife.
3871628 3874324 Who baptized your other brats<br />after you killed my mother?
3874397 3879266 We came out here to pay a friendly call<br />and talk a little business with old friends.
3879369 3881963 Friends! When were we ever friends<br />with the likes of you?
3882038 3885007 Still high and mighty, ain't you?<br />Well, I know all about you.
3885341 3887036 I know your father's turned idiot.
3887110 3888600 You can't pay your taxes.
3888878 3891244 And I come here<br />to offer to buy the place from you...
3891314 3893214 ...to make you a right good offer.
3893349 3894714 Emmy's had a hankerin' to live here.
3894784 3896877 Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.
3897086 3899953 You high-flyin' Irish will find out<br />who's runnin' things around here...
3900023 3901718 ...when you get sold out for taxes.
3901791 3904726 I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel<br />and I'll live in it.
3904794 3906819 But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
3907263 3909094 That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
3910967 3912400 You'll be sorry for that.
3921477 3922444 We'll be back!
3922845 3925109 I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.
3930887 3932047 Pa, come back!
3935525 3936617 Pa, come back!
3936859 3937826 Pa!
3939462 3940759 Yankee coward!
3948905 3949633 Pa!
3970426 3973520 Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.<br />That's Mr. Gerald's watch.
3973796 3976492 You take it. It's for you.<br />Pa'd want you to have it.
3977033 3980366 You ain't got no business partin'<br />from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.
3980436 3983599 You needs all your valuables<br />to sell for that tax money.
3984040 3986008 Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
3987710 3988699 And don't cry.
3989846 3992041 I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
3996386 3998081 Oh, Mammy, Mammy.
4003993 4008123 You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett,<br />you just gotta go on bein' brave.
4008598 4010532 Think about your pa like he used to be.
4010666 4012497 I can't think about Pa.
4012735 4015067 I can't think of anything but that $300.
4015171 4017071 Ain't no good thinkin' about that,<br />Miss Scarlett.
4017140 4018903 Ain't nobody got that much money.
4019942 4023002 Nobody but Yankees and scalawags got<br />that much money now.
4025681 4026739 Rhett!
4026816 4028408 Who that? A Yankee?
4033723 4036624 Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and...
4037493 4039154 ...I haven't any clothes.
4049305 4052103 Scoot up to the attic and get down<br />Ma's old box of dress patterns.
4052175 4053938 What you up to with Miss Ellen's portieres?
4054010 4055136 You'll make me a new dress.
4055211 4057736 Not with Miss Ellen's portieres.<br />Not while I got breath in me.
4057814 4060282 Great balls of fire!<br />They're my portieres now.
4060783 4064344 I'm going to Atlanta for that $300<br />and I've got to go looking like a queen.
4064454 4066615 - Who goin' to Atlanta with you?<br />- I'm going alone.
4066689 4068987 That's what you think.<br />I's goin' to Atlanta with you.
4069058 4070548 With you and that new dress.
4070793 4071851 Now, Mammy, darling.
4071928 4073896 No use to try to sweet-talk me,<br />Miss Scarlett.
4073963 4076625 I's knowed you since I put<br />the first pair of diapers on you.
4076699 4079532 I said I's goin' to Atlanta with you,<br />and goin' I is.
4079969 4083132 Kings and traes, huh?<br />Too good for me, Major!
4083940 4086374 Pity we couldn't have fought the war out<br />in a poker game.
4086442 4089468 You'd have done better than General Grant<br />with far less effort.
4089645 4090669 What is it, Corporal?
4090746 4093977 Sir, there's a lady to see Captain Butler.<br />Says she's his sister.
4094550 4095676 Another sister?
4096419 4098785 This is a jail, not a harem, Captain Butler.
4098855 4100686 No, Major, she ain't one of those.
4100756 4102690 This one's got her mammy with her.
4103459 4104619 She has?
4105728 4108253 I'd like to see this one, Major,<br />without her mammy.
4110500 4113264 Let's see, my losses for the afternoon<br />come to what?
4115771 4117363 Three hundred and forty.
4117440 4119499 My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?
4120376 4121604 All right, Corporal.
4121677 4124544 Show Captain Butler's sister to his cell.
4125414 4127905 Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen.
4132722 4136317 It's hard to be strict with a man<br />who loses money so pleasantly.
4138394 4140828 - Rhett!<br />- Scarlett!
4141163 4143256 My dear little sister.
4144834 4148326 It's all right, Corporal.<br />My sister has brought me no files or saws.
4154343 4155537 Can I really kiss you now?
4155611 4157511 On the forehead like a good brother.
4157813 4160509 No, thanks.<br />I'll wait and hope for better things.
4161317 4164309 Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed<br />when I heard you were in jail.
4164420 4166479 I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.
4166889 4168584 It's not true, they're going to hang you?
4168658 4169818 Would you be sorry?
4169926 4172019 - Oh, Rhett!<br />- Well, don't worry, yet.
4172428 4173861 They have plotted<br />some charge against me...
4173930 4175557 ...but they're really after my money.
4175631 4177963 They think I made off<br />with the Confederate Treasury.
4178034 4179092 Well, did you?
4179702 4181169 What a leading question.
4181337 4183828 But let's not talk<br />about sordid things like money.
4183906 4186932 How good of you to come and see me.<br />And how pretty you look.
4187209 4190235 Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,<br />teasing a country girl like me.
4190346 4193509 Thank heavens you're not in rags.<br />I'm tired of seeing women in rags.
4193583 4194607 Turn around.
4195251 4198152 Marvelous! You look good enough to eat.<br />And prosperous, too.
4198220 4200051 Thank you, I've been doing very well.
4200122 4201919 Everybody's doing well at Tara, only...
4201991 4205290 ...I got so bored I just thought<br />I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
4205828 4208353 You're a heartless creature.<br />But that's part of your charm.
4208431 4210695 You know you've got more charm<br />than the law allows.
4210766 4213326 Now I didn't come here<br />to talk silliness about me, Rhett.
4213402 4216496 I came because I was so miserable<br />at the thought of you in trouble.
4216572 4219439 I was mad at you the night you left me<br />on the road to Tara...
4219508 4220941 ...and I still haven't forgiven you.
4221010 4222671 Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.
4222778 4226475 Well, I must admit I might not be alive,<br />now, only for you.
4226849 4230580 And when I think of myself<br />with everything I could possibly hope for...
4230653 4234521 ...and not a care in the world,<br />and you here in this horrid jail...
4235024 4237993 ...and not even a human jail, Rhett,<br />a horse jail.
4239428 4241760 Oh, listen to me trying<br />to make jokes when...
4242064 4243622 ...when I really want to cry.
4244266 4245699 In a minute I shall cry.
4249338 4252171 Scarlett, can it be possible that...
4252875 4254433 Can what be possible, Rhett?
4254910 4257743 That you've grown a woman's heart,<br />a real woman's heart?
4258648 4260775 I have, Rhett. I know I have.
4263586 4266612 You know, it's worth being in jail<br />just to hear you say that.
4268691 4269988 It's well worth it.
4274930 4277398 You can drop the moonlight<br />and magnolias, Scarlett.
4277633 4279931 So things have been going well<br />at Tara, have they?
4280202 4281567 What have you done with your hands?
4281637 4283764 I went riding last week<br />without my gloves.
4283839 4286899 These don't belong to a lady.<br />You've worked with them like a field hand.
4286976 4288705 Why did you lie? What are you up to?
4289345 4291575 In another minute I'd have believed<br />you cared something.
4291647 4292739 But I do care.
4292815 4294214 Suppose we get down to the truth.
4294283 4298185 You want something from me badly enough<br />to put on quite a show in your velvets.
4298587 4299986 What is it? Money?
4301123 4303318 I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
4303993 4306723 I did lie to you<br />when I said everything was all right.
4306796 4310789 Things are just as bad as they possibly<br />could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.
4311934 4313799 What collateral are you offering?
4313903 4315427 - My earbobs.<br />- Not interested.
4315504 4317495 - A mortgage on Tara.<br />- What would I do with a farm?
4317573 4320098 You wouldn't lose.<br />I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.
4320176 4322269 Not good enough.<br />Have you nothing better?
4325147 4326671 You once said you loved me.
4327650 4329311 If you still love me, Rhett...
4329919 4332114 You haven't forgotten<br />that I'm not a marrying man.
4333189 4335316 No, I haven't forgotten.
4341163 4342824 You're not worth $300.
4343632 4346066 You'll never mean anything<br />but misery to any man.
4346635 4347624 Go on, insult me.
4347703 4349830 I don't care what you say,<br />only give me the money.
4349905 4353671 I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go<br />while there's a breath left in my body.
4353943 4355001 Oh, Rhett.
4355311 4357438 Won't you please give me the money?
4357813 4359974 I couldn't give you the money<br />if I wanted to.
4360049 4362142 My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.
4362218 4365813 If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd be<br />on me like a duck on a June bug.
4366222 4369089 So you see, my dear,<br />you've abased yourself to no purpose.
4372428 4374225 Here, here, here, stop it!
4375164 4377132 Want the Yankees to see you like this?
4377199 4379030 Take your hands off me, you skunk.
4379235 4381396 You knew what I was going to say<br />before I started.
4381470 4384735 You knew you wouldn't lend me the money<br />and yet you let me go on.
4384807 4386502 I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.
4386675 4390076 Cheer up. You can come to my hanging<br />and I'll remember you in my will.
4390146 4393013 I'll come to your hanging.<br />The only thing I'm afraid of...
4393082 4396176 ...is that they won't hang you in time<br />to pay the taxes on Tara.
4402792 4404123 Tell him Belle Watlin'.
4404527 4407360 Where you been lately?<br />Thought you deserted Captain Butler.
4407429 4409556 Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out.
4419175 4422611 Who that? I ain't never see'd hair<br />that color before in my life.
4423279 4424940 Does you know a dyed-hair woman?
4425014 4427676 I wish I did know that one.<br />She'd get my money for me.
4430286 4432277 No matter what they done to you<br />in that jail...
4432354 4434049 ...they didn't do no more<br />than you deserve...
4434123 4436182 ...for visitin' white trash in a jail!
4443265 4444289 Fresh and green.
4444366 4445526 Right off the farm.
4445601 4447626 Hey, what are you doin' tonight, Susy?
4447870 4449269 That's one of them Georgia peaches.
4449338 4451272 There's nothing like that in Ohio.
4451574 4453838 - You know what we're going to do?<br />- What?
4454243 4457269 We're going to give every last one of you<br />40 acres and a mule!
4457346 4459780 - And a mule?<br />- Forty acres and a mule!
4460049 4461016 Gee!
4461083 4462710 'Cause we're your friends...
4462918 4464749 ...and you're gonna become voters...
4464887 4467287 ...and you're gonna vote<br />like your friends do!
4469091 4470388 What's your hurry, sister?
4470459 4471858 What's come over this here town?
4471927 4475090 Yankees have come over it!<br />Same as they've come over all of us.
4477633 4479191 Out of our way, trash!
4479835 4480927 Get out of the way here.
4481003 4482163 Get away! Go on!
4490746 4492407 Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!
4492481 4494381 - Why Frank Kennedy!<br />- And Mammy!
4494450 4496281 It sure is good to see home folks.
4496485 4498009 I didn't know you were in Atlanta.
4498087 4499520 I didn't know you were.
4499588 4501749 Didn't Miss Suellen tell you<br />about my store?
4502124 4504422 Did she? I don't remember.<br />Have you a store?
4506195 4508459 Won't you come in, and look around a bit?
4517006 4519600 I don't suppose it looks like much<br />to a lady, but...
4519675 4521540 ...I can't help being proud of it.
4522211 4523508 You're not making money?
4523579 4526776 Well, I can't complain.<br />In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
4527283 4529342 Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
