408366 410535 What do we care if we were expelled<br />from college?
410577 413621 The war is gonna start any day.<br />We would've left college anyhow.
413663 415457 War! lsn't it exciting, Scarlett?
415498 417417 Do you know those Yankees<br />actually want a war?
417459 419836 -We'll show 'em.<br />-Fiddle-dee-dee!
419878 421254 War, war, war!
421296 424132 This war talk's spoiling all the fun<br />at every party this spring.
424174 426468 I get so bored I could scream!
426885 430138 -Besides, there isn't going to be any war.<br />-Not gonna be any war?
430180 432557 Why, honey, of course<br />there's going to be a war!
432599 436561 If either of you says "war" just once again,<br />I'll go in the house and slam the door.
436686 439773 -But, Scarlett, honey--<br />-Don't you want us to have a war?
445695 446863 Well...
448073 449366 ...but remember...
449866 451076 ...l warned you.
451368 452827 I've got an idea.
452869 455330 We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue<br />at Twelve Oaks.
455372 458124 That's a good idea.<br />Aren't you eating barbecue with us?
458166 461336 I hadn't thought about that yet.<br />I'll think about that tomorrow.
461378 462754 We want all your waltzes.
462796 465340 First Brent, then me, then Brent,<br />then me again and so on.
465382 467384 -Promise?<br />-I'd just love to.
468468 472055 If only I didn't have<br />every one of them taken already.
472097 473848 Why, honey, you can't do that to us.
473890 476518 -How about if we tell you a secret?<br />-A secret? Who about?
476559 478353 Do you know Miss Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta?
478395 481022 Ashley Wilkes' cousin.<br />She's visiting the Wilkes'--
481064 484025 That goody-goody!<br />Who wants to know a secret about her?
484067 485735 Anyway, we heard, that is, they say--
485777 489781 -Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.<br />-The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
489864 491574 Now do we get those waltzes?
491866 493159 Of course.
494077 498081 -I'll bet the other boys will be hopping mad.<br />-Let 'em be mad. We two can handle 'em!
498873 501126 It can't be true. Ashley loves me!
501167 502377 Scarlett!
502794 504421 What has gotten into her?
504462 506256 Do you suppose we made her mad?
506297 510260 Where're you goin' without your shawl,<br />and the night air fixin' to set in?
510468 513054 How come you didn't ask them gentlemen<br />to stay for supper?
513096 515140 You ain't got no more manners<br />than a field hand...
515181 517350 ...after me and Miss Ellen done labored<br />with you.
517392 519936 Miss Scarlett, come on in the house!
519978 522230 Come on in before you catch<br />your death of dampness.
522272 525025 No! I'll wait for Pa to come home<br />from the Wilkes'.
525066 526693 Come on in here!
527277 528695 Come on!
543877 545253 Quittin' time!
545295 546629 Who says it's quittin' time?
546671 547922 I says it's quittin' time.
547964 551426 I's the foreman. I's the one that says<br />when it's quittin' time at Tara!
551468 552969 Quittin' time!
553470 555388 Quittin' time!
596388 599599 There's none in the county can touch you,<br />and none in the state.
600975 601976 Pa!
602268 604562 So it's proud of yourself, you are.
606773 608733 Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara!
608775 612237 So, you've been spying on me,<br />and like your sister, Suellen...
612278 614531 ...you'll tell your mother<br />I was jumping again.
614572 617951 Pa, you know I'm no tattletale like Suellen,<br />but it does seem to me...
617992 620829 ...after you broke your knee last year<br />jumping that same fence--
620870 625458 I'll not have me own daughter tellin' me<br />what I shall jump and not jump.
625500 627127 It's my own neck, so it is.
627168 631047 All right, Pa, you jump what you please.<br />How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?
631089 632132 The Wilkeses?
632173 636177 Just as you'd expect with the barbecue<br />tomorrow and talking nothing but war.
636386 639139 Oh, bother the war.<br />Was there anyone else there?
639180 642517 Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton,<br />from Atlanta and her brother, Charles.
642559 644019 Melanie Hamilton!
644060 646229 She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny.<br />I hate her.
646271 647856 Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
647897 650984 Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.
651484 653862 What's your interest in Ashley<br />and Miss Melanie?
655196 657323 It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.
657365 660618 Has he been trifling with you?<br />Has he asked you to marry him?
660660 662120 -No!<br />-No, nor will he.
662162 665457 I have it in strictest confidence<br />from John Wilkes this afternoon...
665498 667250 ...Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.
667292 669794 It will be announced tomorrow night<br />at the ball.
670378 672047 I don't believe it.
672088 674174 Here! Here! Where are you off to?
674466 675383 Scarlett!
676384 678178 What are you about?
678595 681431 Have you made a spectacle of yourself<br />running after a man...
681473 684726 ...who's not in love with you when<br />you might have any man in the county?
684768 688229 I haven't been running after him.<br />It's just a surprise, that's all.
688271 691024 Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.
691066 694652 If Ashley wanted to marry you,<br />it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes".
694694 698239 I want my girl to be happy.<br />You'd not be happy with him.
698281 699741 I would, I would!
699783 701534 What difference does it make<br />who you marry...
701576 704120 ...so long as he's a Southerner<br />and thinks like you?
704162 706623 And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.
706664 709125 I don't want Tara.<br />Plantations don't mean anything when--
709167 713922 You mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,<br />that land doesn't mean anything to you?
713963 716633 Why, land is the only thing in the world<br />worth working for...
716675 720553 ...worth fighting for, worth dying for,<br />because it's the only thing that lasts.
720595 724140 -Oh, Pa, you talk like an lrishman.<br />-It's proud I am that I'm lrish.
724182 727727 And don't you be forgetting, Missy,<br />that you're half lrish too.
727769 730230 And to anyone with a drop of lrish blood<br />in them...
730271 732524 ...why, the land they live on<br />is like their mother.
732565 737237 Oh, but you're just a child.<br />It'll come to you, this love of the land.
737278 739572 There's no getting away from it<br />if you're lrish.
764472 765640 Yonder she comes!
765682 768435 Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,<br />your ma's home!
768476 771438 Actin' like a wet nurse<br />to them low-down, poor white trash...
771479 775025 ...instead of bein' here eatin' her supper.<br />Cookie, stir up the fire!
775066 777569 Miss Ellen's got no business<br />wearin' herself out.
778069 780530 Take the lamp out on the porch!<br />Wearin' herself out.
780572 783033 Mist' Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.
783074 785118 Wearin' herself out<br />waitin' on the poor white trash.
785160 787328 Shut up, dogs!<br />Barkin' in the house like that.
787370 790040 Get up from there. Don't you hear<br />that Miss Ellen's comin'?
790081 792375 Get out there and get her medicine chest.
792876 795128 We was gettin' worried about you,<br />Miss Ellen.
795170 797881 -Mist' Gerald--<br />-All right, Pork. I'm home.
798298 801926 Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing<br />the creek bottom today.
801968 804637 What do you want me<br />to start on tomorrow?
804679 808558 Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come<br />from Emmy Slattery's bedside.
808600 810226 Your child has been born.
810268 813521 My child, ma'am?<br />I'm sure I don't understand.
813563 815982 Has been born and, mercifully, has died.
816775 818485 Goodnight, Mr. Wilkerson.
821988 824240 I'll fix your supper for you myself,<br />and you eats it.
824282 825533 After prayers, Mammy.
825575 826659 Yes, ma'am.
827869 829162 Mr. O'Hara.
829788 831456 You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
831498 835043 Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?<br />He's the best overseer in the county.
835085 837253 He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.
837295 838380 But....
839798 840882 -No!<br />-Yes.
842300 845053 The Yankee Wilkerson<br />and the white-trash Slattery girl!
845095 847138 We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
847180 848390 Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
854062 855730 I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!
855772 858525 I don't like your tone, Suellen.<br />Your pink gown is lovely.
858566 862153 -Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?<br />-But you may wear my garnets with it.
862195 864948 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
864989 866658 Scarlett...
866700 869285 ...you look tired, my dear.<br />I'm worried about you.
870161 871538 I'm all right, Mother.
871579 874124 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
874165 875542 I'm 13 now.
875583 877919 You may go to the barbecue<br />and stay up through supper.
877961 880255 I didn't want to wear<br />your tacky green dress anyhow, stingy!
880296 881256 Oh, hush up!
881297 882799 Prayers, girls.
889472 894477 "And to all the saints, that I have sinned<br />exceedingly in thought, word and deed...
894769 896229 "...through my fault.
896271 899482 "Through my fault,<br />through my most grievous fault.
899899 903319 "Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary,<br />ever Virgin...
903361 905822 "...Blessed Michael, the Archangel...
905864 907741 "...Blessed John the Baptist...
907782 910076 "...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...
910660 913830 "...and all the saints<br />to pray to the Lord, our God, for me."
913872 915874 But Ashley doesn't know I love him!
917083 920795 I'll tell him that I love him<br />and then he can't marry her!
921963 925133 "May the Almighty,<br />and most merciful Lord...
925175 927093 "...grant us pardon, absolution...
927469 929262 "...and remission of our sins. Amen."
931890 934100 Just hold on and suck in.
935185 937645 Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.
937687 940148 You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.
940190 941941 Oh, yes, ma'am, you is!
941983 944194 You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.
945195 947280 No, I'm not!
949991 952035 Put on the dress,<br />because we're late already.
952077 954037 -What's my lamb gonna wear?<br />-That.
954079 958083 No you ain't! You can't show your bosom<br />before three o'clock.
958375 960126 I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!
960168 963588 If you say one word to Mother,<br />I won't eat a bite!
967676 968760 Well....
975392 978728 Keep your shawl on.<br />I ain't aimin' for you to get all freckled...
978770 982774 ...after the buttermilk I done put on you<br />all this winter, bleachin' them freckles.
989072 993034 Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on<br />and be good, and eat just a little, honey.
993076 994160 No.
994494 998289 I'm going to have a good time today<br />and do my eating at the barbecue.
998581 1001334 If you don't care what folks says<br />about this family, I does!
1001376 1004629 I has told you and told you<br />that you can always tell a lady...
1004671 1006923 ...by the way she eats with folks.<br />Like a bird!
1006965 1009050 I ain't aimin' for you to go after<br />Mr. Wilkes...
1009092 1011344 ...and eat like a field hand<br />and gobble like a hog!
1011386 1012679 Fiddle-dee-dee!
1013179 1016641 Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl<br />with a healthy appetite.
1016683 1019519 What gentlemen says and what they thinks<br />is two different things.
1019561 1023398 And I ain't noticed Mist' Ashley<br />askin' to marry you!
1038788 1042667 Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need<br />of havin' it come right back up again.
1045170 1048340 Why does a girl have to be so silly<br />to catch a husband?
1048381 1053636 Scarlett, ifyou're not here by the time<br />I count ten, we'll be goin' without you!
1053678 1054846 I'm coming, Pa!
1054888 1055930 One...
1055972 1057599 ...two, three...
1058266 1060393 ...four, five, six....
1061478 1062729 Oh, dear!
1062771 1066566 My stays are so tight I know I'll never get<br />through the day without belching.
1091383 1095345 Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day<br />you'll be having for the barbecue.
1095387 1098348 So it seems, Gerald.<br />But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
1098390 1100433 She's after settling accounts<br />with the overseer.
1100475 1102227 But she'll be along for the ball tonight.
1102268 1104145 Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
1104187 1106231 Thank you kindly, lndia.
1106272 1108983 Your daughter's getting prettier every day,<br />John.
1109567 1112529 India, here are the O'Hara girls.<br />We must greet them.
1112570 1115824 I can't stand Scarlett. If you saw<br />the way she throws herself at Ashley.
1115865 1118034 Now, that's your brother's business.
1118076 1120620 You must remember your duties<br />as hostess.
1120662 1121996 Good morning, girls.
1123581 1125166 Good morning, Scarlett.
1125875 1128336 Why, lndia Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
1128378 1131673 -Perfectly lovely, darling.<br />-I just can't take my eyes off it.
1133591 1134634 Scarlett, honey....
1134676 1136720 You're looking mighty fine this morning.
1136761 1139097 -Good morning, Miss Scarlett.<br />-Good morning.
1139764 1141725 -It's a pleasure to see you.<br />-Good morning.
1141766 1142976 Howdy, Miss Scarlett.
1144686 1145687 Ashley!
1148064 1149691 Scarlett, my dear.
1151192 1153319 I've been looking for you everywhere.
1153361 1155530 I've got something I must tell you.
1155572 1159242 -Can't we go some place where it's quiet?<br />-Yes, I'd like to, but l...
1159284 1161244 ...l have something to tell you too.
1161286 1164080 Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
1164873 1167334 But come say hello<br />to my cousin, Melanie, first.
1167375 1168960 Oh, do we have to?
1169294 1172255 She's been looking forward<br />to seeing you again.
1172297 1173381 Melanie!
1174466 1175967 Here's Scarlett.
1176468 1177469 Scarlett!
1178970 1180722 I'm so glad to see you again.
1180764 1183933 Melanie Hamilton!<br />What a surprise to run into you here.
1183975 1186144 I hope you'll stay with us<br />a few days at least.
1186186 1189856 I hope I shall stay long enough for us<br />to become real friends, Scarlett.
1189898 1191358 I do so want us to be.
1191399 1193318 We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?
1193360 1195820 We'll just have to make the biggest fuss<br />over her, won't we?
1195862 1198948 If there's anybody knows how to give a girl<br />a good time, it's Ashley.
1198990 1202243 Though I expect our good times will seem<br />silly to you because you're so serious.
1202285 1204871 Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
1205288 1206748 I've always admired you so.
1206790 1208458 I wish I could be more like you.
1208500 1211419 You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,<br />and say things you don't mean.
1211461 1214964 Nobody could accuse Melanie<br />of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
1215465 1217634 Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?
1217676 1220095 Ashley never means a word he says<br />to any girl.
1220679 1224140 Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,<br />you handsome old thing, you!
1224182 1225850 But, oh, Miss O'Hara, l....
1225892 1228144 Was it kind to bring<br />your good-looking brother here...
1228186 1230689 ...just to break my poor, simple,<br />country-girl's heart?
1230980 1233024 She never even noticed Charles before.
1233066 1235318 Because he's your beau,<br />she's after him like a hornet.
1235360 1237946 Charles Hamilton,<br />I want to eat barbecue with you.
1237987 1241741 Mind you, don't go philandering with<br />any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.
1241783 1243159 I won't, Miss O'Hara!
1243660 1244869 I couldn't!
1245370 1248123 I do declare, Frank Kennedy,<br />if you don't look dashing...
1248164 1249541 ...with that new set of whiskers!
1249582 1252085 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
1252460 1255338 Charles and Rafe asked me<br />to eat barbecue with them...
1255380 1257632 ...but I told them I couldn't<br />because I promised you.
1257674 1261261 You needn't be so amused. Look at her!<br />She's after your beau now!
1261678 1264472 Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1264973 1266975 I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.
1267267 1269936 What's your sister so mad about?<br />You sparkin' her beau?
1269978 1273148 As if I couldn't get a better beau<br />than that old maid in britches.
1273189 1276526 Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome<br />old things, you! No, you're not!
1276568 1278153 I won't say that. I'm mad at you!
1278194 1279237 What have we done?
1279279 1281531 You haven't been near me all day.<br />I wore this old dress...
1281573 1282949 ...'cause I thought you liked it.
1282991 1285035 I was counting on eating barbecue<br />with you two.
1285076 1287454 -Well, you are, Scarlett.<br />-Of course, you are.
1287495 1291374 Oh, I never can make up my mind<br />which of you two is the handsomer.
1291666 1294878 I was awake all last night trying<br />to figure it out.
1300467 1302344 Cathleen, who's that?
1302385 1303345 Who?
1303386 1305388 That man looking at us and smiling.
1305764 1307057 The nasty, dark one.
1307098 1311061 My dear, don't you know?<br />That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.
1311186 1313271 He has the most terrible reputation.
1318193 1321446 He looks as if, as if he knows<br />what I look like without my shimmy!
1321488 1322572 Scarlett!
1322864 1324699 Why, my dear, he isn't received!
1325075 1326618 He spends a lot of time up North...
1326659 1329245 ...because his folks in Charleston<br />won't even speak to him.
1329287 1331623 He was expelled from West Point,<br />he's so fast.
1331664 1335043 And then there's that business<br />about that girl he wouldn't marry.
1335085 1336252 Tell, tell!
1336294 1340298 Well, he took her out buggy riding<br />in the late afternoon without a chaperon!
1341091 1343593 And then he refused to marry her!
1347180 1349766 No, but she was ruined just the same.
1355480 1357148 Ashley!
1357190 1358358 Happy?
1358400 1359401 So happy!
1361069 1363279 You seem to belong here...
1363697 1366074 ...as if it had all been imagined for you.
1367575 1369953 I like to feel that I belong<br />to the things you love.
1369994 1371621 You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
1371663 1372789 Yes, Ashley.
1373164 1374624 I love it as...
1374666 1376292 ...as more than a house.
1376876 1380880 It's a whole world that wants only<br />to be graceful and beautiful.
1380964 1383174 It's so unaware that it may not last...
1383967 1385051 ...forever.
1385093 1388430 You're afraid of what may happen<br />if the war comes, aren't you?
1388471 1391099 But we don't have to be afraid for us.
1391683 1394185 No war can come into our world, Ashley.
1395186 1396479 Whatever comes...
1397188 1399899 ...l'll love you, just as I do now...
1400692 1401776 ...until I die.
1406865 1408658 Isn't this better than sitting at a table?
1408700 1411161 A girl hasn't got but two sides to her<br />at a table.
1412579 1413621 I'll go get her dessert.
1413663 1416166 -Here, she said me.<br />-Allow me, Miss O'Hara.
1418376 1419586 I think....
1422881 1425675 I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
1427260 1428970 Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!
1429471 1430680 Thank you.
1430972 1432223 Go get it.
1432265 1434392 Isn't he the luckiest...?
1441691 1442692 Miss O'Hara...
1444277 1445278 ...l love you.
1446863 1449282 I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
1452660 1455622 Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.
1455663 1458124 Well-brought-up young ladies<br />take naps at parties.
1458166 1462128 And it's high time you started behavin' and<br />actin' like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
1462170 1465632 When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice<br />any Yankee girls taking naps.
1465674 1469636 No, and you ain't gonna see<br />no Yankee girls at the ball tonight neither.
1469678 1471346 How was Ashley today, Scarlett?
1471388 1474057 He didn't seem to be paying<br />much attention to you.
1474099 1475767 You mind your own business!
1476101 1478228 You'll be lucky not to lose<br />ol' whisker-face Kennedy.
1478269 1479646 You've liked Ashley for months!
1479688 1482148 His engagement's gonna be announced<br />tonight. Pa said so this morning.
1482190 1483400 That's all you know.
1484401 1487320 Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!<br />You all behave yourselves.
1487362 1489030 Actin' like poor, white-trash children!
1489072 1492033 If you's old enough to go to parties,<br />you's old enough to act like ladies.
1492075 1493159 Who cares!
1544586 1547130 We've borne enough insults<br />from the meddling Yankees.
1547172 1549924 It's time we made them understand<br />we'll keep our slaves...
1549966 1551426 ...with or without their approval.
1551468 1554346 'Twas the sovereign right of the<br />state of Georgia to secede from the Union!
1554387 1555347 That's right!
1555388 1557974 The South must assert herself<br />by force of arms.
1558475 1562729 After we've fired on the Yankee rascals<br />at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!
1562771 1565148 -There's no other way!<br />-Fight! That's right. Fight!
1565190 1566941 Let the Yankees ask for peace!
1566983 1570570 The situation is very simple.<br />The Yankees can't fight and we can.
1571696 1573156 There won't even be a battle.
1573198 1574824 They'll just turn and run every time.
1574866 1576743 One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.
1576785 1578745 We'll finish them in one battle.
1578787 1580747 Gentlemen can always fight better<br />than rabble.
1580789 1583124 Yes, gentlemen always can fight better<br />than rabble.
1583166 1585543 What does the captain of our troop say?
1585585 1588963 Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights<br />I go with her.
1589964 1593343 But, like my father, I hope that the Yankees<br />will let us leave the Union in peace.
1593385 1594928 -But, Ashley....<br />-But, Ashley, they've insulted us!
1594969 1596930 You can't mean you don't want war!
1596971 1600558 Most of the miseries of the world<br />were caused by wars.
1600600 1604562 And when the wars were over<br />no one ever knew what they were about.
1604688 1606147 If it wasn't that I knew you--
1606189 1610193 Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been<br />up North, I hear.
1610360 1612362 Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?
1612987 1615532 I think it's hard winning a war with words,<br />gentlemen.
1615573 1617033 What do you mean, sir?
1617075 1620036 There's not a cannon factory<br />in the whole South.
1620078 1622038 What difference does that make<br />to a gentleman?
1622080 1625333 It'll make a great deal of difference<br />to a great many gentlemen, sir.
1625375 1628128 Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,<br />that the Yankees can lick us?
1628169 1629421 No, I'm not hinting.
1629462 1632632 I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees<br />are better equipped than we.
1632674 1634926 They've got factories, shipyards,<br />coal mines...
1634968 1637846 ...and a fleet to bottle up our harbors<br />and starve us to death.
1637887 1641433 All we've got is cotton and slaves<br />and arrogance.
1641474 1645020 -That's Yankee treachery!<br />-Sir, I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
1645061 1646646 I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
1646688 1649149 Apologies aren't enough, sir!
1649190 1652027 I hear you were turned out of West Point,<br />Mr. Rhett Butler...
1652068 1656072 ...and you aren't received by any decent<br />family in Charleston, not even your own!
1660660 1663663 I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
1665498 1668251 Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about<br />and look over your place.
1668293 1671588 I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy<br />and cigars and...
1672088 1673465 ...dreams of victory.
1680472 1684059 That'sjust about what you could expect<br />from somebody like Rhett Butler.
1684100 1685935 You did everything but call him out.
1685977 1687145 He refused to fight.
1687187 1690023 Not quite that, Charles.<br />He refused to take advantage of you.
1690065 1691232 Take advantage of me?
1691274 1692734 He's one of the best shots in the country...
1692776 1694444 ...as he's proved a number of times...
1694486 1696446 ...against steadier hands and cooler heads<br />than yours.
1696488 1697739 -I'll show him!<br />-Now, please.
1697781 1700325 Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
1700367 1703286 You may be needed<br />for more important fighting, Charles.
1703578 1706039 Now, if you'll excuse me,<br />Mr. Butler is our guest.
1706081 1708166 I think I'll just show him around.
1720887 1721971 Ashley!
1729562 1731064 Ashley!
1731690 1732774 Scarlett.
1734567 1736778 Who're you hiding from in here?
1741991 1743576 What are you up to?
1745662 1748665 Well, why aren't you upstairs resting<br />with the other girls?
1750000 1752085 What is this, Scarlett? A secret?
1752460 1754879 Oh, Ashley, Ashley...
1755463 1756673 ...l love you.
1756965 1758133 Scarlett!
1758174 1759592 I love you, I do!
1761970 1765640 Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered<br />every other man's heart today?
1765682 1768143 You've always had mine.<br />You cut your teeth on it.
1768184 1769853 Oh, don't tease me now.
1769894 1772647 Have I your heart, my darling?<br />I love you, I love you.
1772689 1776443 You mustn't say such things.<br />You'll hate me for hearing them.
1776484 1780488 Oh, I could never hate you,<br />and I know you must care about me.
1781072 1783199 Oh, you do care, don't you?
1784367 1785493 Yes...
1786077 1787162 ...l care.
1788663 1791583 Oh, can't we go away and forget<br />we ever said these things?
1793376 1794961 But how can we do that?
1795378 1797630 Don't you want to marry me?
1797672 1799424 I'm going to marry Melanie.
1799466 1801926 But you can't. Not if you care for me.
1801968 1805096 Oh, my dear, why must you make me<br />say things that will hurt you?
1805972 1807974 How can I make you understand?
1808892 1810435 You're so young and unthinking.
1810477 1811853 You don't know what marriage means.
1811895 1814522 I know I love you,<br />and I want to be your wife.
1814564 1816024 You don't love Melanie.
1816066 1817567 She's like me, Scarlett.
1817984 1820695 She's part of my blood<br />and we understand each other.
1820987 1823031 But you love me.
1823073 1824699 How could I help loving you?
1825283 1827827 You have all the passion for life that I lack.
1827869 1830455 That kind of love isn't enough<br />for a successful marriage...
1830497 1832123 ...for two people as different as we are.
1832165 1835377 Well, why don't you say it, you coward?<br />You're afraid to marry me.
1835669 1837754 You'd rather live with that fool<br />who can't speak except...
1837796 1841633 ...to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel<br />of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.
1841675 1843134 You mustn't say such things<br />about Melanie.
1843176 1844928 Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
1844969 1847847 You led me on, you made me believe<br />you wanted to marry me.
1847889 1850225 Now, Scarlett, be fair.<br />I never, at any time--
1850266 1853770 You did, it's true you did!<br />I'll hate you till I die!
1854479 1857774 I can't think of anything bad enough<br />to call you.
1884676 1886594 Has the war started?
1887178 1890598 Sir, you should have made<br />your presence known.
1890890 1893226 In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
1893268 1895437 That wouldn't have been very tactful,<br />would it?
1895478 1898064 But don't worry,<br />your secret is safe with me.
1898690 1899858 Sir, you are no gentleman!
1899899 1901985 And you, Miss, are no lady.
1902485 1904320 Don't think I hold that against you.
1904362 1906156 Ladies have never held any charm for me.
1906197 1909242 First you take a low, common advantage<br />of me, then you insult me.
1909284 1912746 I meant it as a compliment<br />and I hope to see more of you...
1912787 1915623 ...when you're free of the spell<br />of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.
1915665 1920128 He doesn't strike me as half good enough<br />for a girl of your, what was it?
1920170 1921838 Your "passion for living."
1921880 1924466 How dare you!<br />You aren't fit to wipe his boots.
1925967 1928970 And you were going to hate him<br />for the rest of your life.
1931389 1935393 She certainly made a fool of herself<br />running after all the men at the barbecue.
1935477 1937145 That's not fair, lndia.
1937187 1940023 She's so attractive,<br />the menjust naturally flock to her.
1940065 1942359 Oh, Melanie, you're just too good<br />to be true.
1942400 1944235 Didn't you see her going after<br />your brother, Charles?
1944277 1946446 Yes, and she knows Charles belongs to me.
1946488 1948156 Oh, you're wrong, lndia.
1948198 1951326 Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
1951368 1954329 Men may flirt with girls like that<br />but they don't marry them.
1954371 1956581 I think you're being very mean to her.
1965173 1968176 War! War's declared! War!
1979896 1981272 Miss O'Hara!
1984401 1985735 Miss O'Hara!
1985777 1989030 Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,<br />volunteers to fight against us.
1989072 1991741 Don't you men ever think<br />of anything important?
1991783 1994244 But it's war and everybody's going off<br />to enlist.
1994285 1995829 They're going right away. I'm going too.
1995870 1996871 Everybody?
2001167 2003586 Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
2003962 2005672 To see us go, I mean.
2006172 2008133 I'll cry into my pillow every night.
2008174 2010343 Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
2010385 2014931 You're the most beautiful girl in the world,<br />and the sweetest and the dearest.
2014973 2017225 I know I couldn't hope<br />that you could love me.
2017267 2020729 I'm so clumsy and stupid<br />and not nearly good enough for you.
2020770 2024774 But if you could think of marrying me<br />I'd do anything in the world for you.
2024899 2026401 Just anything. I promise.
2026985 2028236 What did you say?
2028278 2031072 Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?
2036870 2038872 Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
2039497 2041791 You will? You'll marry me.<br />You'll wait for me?
2042167 2043460 I don't think I'd want to wait.
2043501 2045962 You mean you'll marry me before I go?
2046463 2048423 Oh, Miss O'Hara.
2048465 2050175 Scarlett....
2051885 2053428 When may I speak to your father?
2053470 2054554 The sooner the better.
2054596 2056139 I'll go now. I can't wait.
2056181 2058183 Will you excuse me, dear?
2063063 2064939 Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.
2064981 2066941 It'll be a week at least<br />before they call on me.
2066983 2070070 Only a week, and then they'll take you<br />away from me.
2103269 2105939 Scarlett, I thought of you<br />at our wedding yesterday...
2105980 2109067 ...and I hoped that yours would be<br />as beautiful, and it was.
2109776 2110777 Was it?
2111194 2113571 Now we're really and truly sisters.
2114280 2115782 -Charles.<br />-Melanie.
2123665 2126835 Don't cry, darling,<br />the war will be over in a few weeks...
2126876 2128962 ...and I'll be coming back to you.
2173173 2174466 Miss Scarlett!
2175175 2178553 Well, I don't care.<br />I'm too young to be a widow.
2178595 2179888 Miss Scarlett!
2181681 2184267 Why, I just go around scaring people<br />in that thing.
2185393 2187937 You ain't supposed to be around people.<br />You's in mournin'.
2187979 2190273 For what? I don't feel anything.
2190982 2193568 Why should I have to pretend<br />and pretend....
2194277 2195779 What is it?
2196488 2198573 Oh, baby....
2199991 2200867 What is it?
2201284 2202786 My life is over.
2203161 2205789 Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.
2208166 2209542 Oh, Mother.
2209584 2213588 I know you'll think I'm horrible,<br />but I just can't bear going around in black.
2214297 2217050 It's bad enough not being able<br />to go to any parties...
2217092 2218635 ...but looking this way too.
2218677 2220637 I don't think you're at all horrible.
2220679 2224474 It's only natural to want to look young<br />and be young when you are young.
2225100 2226768 Oh, baby....
2227769 2229729 How would you like<br />to go visiting somewhere?
2229771 2231022 Savannah perhaps?
2231064 2233066 What would I do in Savannah?
2233400 2235151 Well, Atlanta then.
2235193 2237445 There's lots going on there.
2237487 2240490 And you could stay<br />with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
2241366 2242575 Melanie.
2242992 2244077 Yes.
2244869 2246121 Yes, I could, couldn't l?
2246162 2249332 Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,<br />sweeter than anybody in the world.
2249374 2250667 You'd like it, really?
2251292 2254462 All right then.<br />Now stop your crying and smile.
2256381 2257966 You can take Prissy with you.
2258675 2260885 Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,<br />Mammy.
2261261 2263179 I'll go write the necessary letters.
2266266 2267267 Atlanta!
2267600 2270937 Savannah would be better for you.<br />You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.
2270979 2272522 What trouble are you talking about?
2272564 2276026 You know what trouble I's talkin' about.<br />I's talkin' about Mist' Ashley Wilkes.
2276067 2278028 He'll be comin' to Atlanta<br />when he gets his leave...
2278069 2280655 ...and you're sittin' there waitin'<br />for him just like a spider!
2280697 2284200 -He belongs to Miss Melanie--<br />-You go pack my things like Mother said.
2305180 2308141 They're all whispering,<br />and I just know it's about her.
2308183 2310060 What's it matter what they say,<br />Aunt Pittypat?
2310101 2314856 But Scarlett is living under my roof<br />so they all think I'm responsible for her...
2314898 2318735 ...and for a widow to appear in public<br />at a social gathering!
2318777 2321446 Every time I think of it I feel faint!
2321488 2325742 Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here<br />only to help raise money for the cause.
2325784 2328953 It was splendid of her<br />to make the sacrifice.
2328995 2330747 Anyone would think, to hear you talk...
2330789 2334292 ...that she came here to dance<br />instead of to sell things.
2346596 2348431 Ladies and gentlemen!
2348473 2351101 I have important news! Glorious news!
2351476 2354562 Another triumph<br />for our magnificent men in arms.
2355271 2358525 General Lee has completely<br />whipped the enemy.
2358566 2362570 And swept the Yankee Army<br />northward from Virginia.
2371788 2374874 And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
2375375 2379379 We have with us tonight that most daring<br />of all blockade-runners...
2379879 2383425 ...whose fleet schooners,<br />slipping past the Yankee guns...
2383466 2387429 ...have brought us here the very woolens<br />and laces we wear tonight.
2387470 2391474 I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that<br />will-o'-the-wisp of the bounding main.
2391766 2394561 None other than our friend<br />from Charleston...
2394894 2396479 ...Captain Rhett Butler!
2417375 2418877 Permit me.
2423173 2426301 Captain Butler, it's such a pleasure<br />to see you again.
2426676 2428720 I met you last at my husband's home.
2428762 2430972 That's kind of you to remember,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2431389 2434059 Did you meet Captain Butler<br />at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
2434100 2436186 Yes. I, I think so.
2436478 2439147 Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />It was in the library.
2439189 2441066 You had broken something.
2442192 2444652 Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
2444694 2448490 Ladies, the Confederacy asks for<br />your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.
2448782 2450825 We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.
2450867 2452202 Wait.
2452786 2455163 On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br />and Mrs. Hamilton.
2456164 2457582 Thank you, Captain Butler.
2457874 2459501 Just a moment, please.
2462587 2464631 But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
2464673 2467967 It may help my husband more,<br />off my finger.
2468677 2469761 Thank you.
2472180 2474766 That's a very beautiful thing to do,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2475266 2476393 Here.
2476685 2479187 You can have mine, too, for the cause.
2481481 2485402 And you, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />I know just how much that means to you.
2485694 2487028 -Melanie!<br />-Yes, Dr. Meade.
2487070 2489447 I need your approval,<br />as a member of the Committee...
2489489 2492075 ...for something we want to do<br />that's rather shocking.
2492784 2494661 Will you excuse us, please?
2496579 2500166 I'll say one thing, the war makes<br />the most peculiar widows.
2500500 2501751 I wish you'd go away.
2501793 2504879 If you had any raising you'd know<br />I never want to see you again.
2507799 2509342 Now, why be silly?
2509384 2513388 You've no reason for hating me.<br />I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
2515265 2518935 I guess I'd be very unpatriotic<br />to hate one of the great heroes of the war.
2518977 2522731 I do declare I was surprised to see<br />you turn out to be such a noble character.
2522772 2526234 I can't bear to take advantage<br />of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.
2526276 2528361 I'm neither noble nor heroic.
2528695 2529946 But you are a blockade-runner.
2529988 2532073 For profit, and profit only.
2532490 2534534 Are you telling me<br />you don't believe in the cause?
2534576 2536995 I believe in Rhett Butler.<br />He's the only cause I know.
2537287 2539080 The rest doesn't mean much to me.
2542167 2544252 And now, ladies and gentlemen...
2544294 2547172 ...l have a startling surprise<br />for the benefit of the hospital.
2548965 2552969 Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening<br />reel with the lady of your choice...
2553470 2555180 ...you must bid for her.
2556681 2559726 Caroline Meade, how can you permit<br />your husband to conduct this...
2559768 2561436 ...this slave auction?
2561478 2564064 Dolly Merriwether,<br />how dare you criticize me!
2564481 2566149 Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...
2566191 2569027 ...that if it's for the benefit of the cause,<br />it's quite all right.
2569069 2570320 She did!
2570362 2573365 Oh dear, oh dear.<br />Where are my smelling salts?
2573782 2575033 I think I shall faint.
2575075 2577535 Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.
2577577 2580163 If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
2581498 2584292 Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?<br />Make your offers.
2585168 2586878 Don't be bashful, gentlemen.
2587671 2591633 Twenty dollars,<br />$20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.
2591675 2593927 Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing.
2593968 2596137 Only $25 to give your--
2596179 2598264 One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
2598890 2600141 For what lady, sir?
2600183 2602102 For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2604979 2606064 For whom, sir?
2606481 2608233 Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2608274 2610527 Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,<br />Captain Butler...
2610568 2613321 ...but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles<br />would be proud to--
2613363 2616866 Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2617575 2620036 She will not consider it, sir.
2620078 2621371 Oh yes, I will.
2633675 2636886 Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.
2637971 2640056 We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.
2640098 2641766 It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?
2642100 2643226 It's worse.
2643268 2645228 But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
2645270 2647022 I don't care what you expect<br />or what they think.
2647063 2648648 I'm going to dance and dance.
2648690 2651693 Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing<br />with Abe Lincoln himself.
2683600 2686227 Another dance and my reputation<br />will be lost forever.
2686269 2688438 With enough courage,<br />you can do without a reputation.
2688480 2690565 Oh, you do talk scandalous.
2698573 2701034 You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
2701076 2704954 Don't start flirting with me.<br />I'm not one of your plantation beaux.
2704996 2707290 I want more than flirting from you.
2707791 2709084 What do you want?
2709876 2714172 I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take<br />that Southern belle simper off your face.
2715090 2716633 Some day I want you to say to me...
2716675 2719469 ...the words I heard you say<br />to Ashley Wilkes:
2719886 2721096 "l love you."
2721596 2725600 That's something you'll never hear from<br />me, Captain Butler, as long as you live.
2745787 2748081 How sweet, how kind.
2748665 2750625 He is a thoughtful gentleman.
2750667 2754462 Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say<br />something about my sacrifice?
2762387 2764431 Oh, the darling thing.
2764472 2766641 Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.
2766683 2769728 You didn't really bring it all the way<br />from Paris just for me.
2769769 2773273 Yes, I thought it was about time<br />I got you out of that fake mourning.
2773982 2776735 Next trip I'll bring you some green silk<br />for a frock to match it.
2776776 2777944 Oh, Rhett.
2777986 2783199 It's my duty to our brave boys at the front<br />to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
2783783 2786870 Oh, it's so long<br />since I've had anything new.
2797088 2798381 How do I look?
2799382 2800967 Awful! Just awful.
2801676 2802927 Why, what's the matter?
2802969 2804220 This war has stopped being a joke...
2804262 2807474 ...when a girl like you doesn't know how<br />to wear the latest fashion.
2812896 2815398 Oh, Rhett, let me do it.
2820779 2823865 But, Rhett, I don't know how I dare wear it.
2824783 2826201 You will though.
2826785 2829329 And another thing, those pantalettes.
2829371 2832248 I don't know a woman in Paris<br />that wears pantalettes anymore.
2832290 2833500 Oh, what do they...?
2833875 2836044 You shouldn't talk about such things.
2836086 2837128 You little hypocrite.
2837170 2839839 You don't mind my knowing about them,<br />just my talking.
2839881 2843635 But, I really can't go on accepting gifts<br />from you, though you are awfully kind.
2843677 2845720 I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.
2845762 2849557 I never give anything without expecting<br />something in return. I always get paid.
2849599 2852060 If you think I'll marry you to pay<br />for the bonnet, I won't.
2852102 2854688 Don't flatter yourself.<br />I'm not a marrying man.
2855480 2858066 Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
2868368 2870161 Open your eyes and look at me.
2871579 2873540 No, I don't think I will kiss you...
2873581 2875333 ...although you need kissing badly.
2875375 2876751 That's what's wrong with you.
2876793 2879754 You should be kissed and often.<br />And by someone who knows how.
2879796 2882424 Oh, and I suppose you think<br />you're the proper person.
2882465 2885301 I might be, if the right moment ever came.
2885802 2888555 You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,<br />Rhett Butler.
2888596 2891266 And I don't know why<br />I let you come and see me.
2891683 2893351 I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
2893393 2895645 Because I'm the only man over 16<br />and under 60...
2895687 2897939 ...who's around to show you a good time.
2897981 2900650 But cheer up,<br />the war can't last much longer.
2900692 2902444 Oh really, Rhett? Why?
2902485 2905655 There's a battle going on right now<br />that ought to pretty well fix things...
2905697 2906740 ...one way or the other.
2906781 2908867 Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
2910577 2913830 You still haven't gotten the wooden-headed<br />Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
2913872 2915331 Yes, I suppose he's in it.
2915373 2917292 Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?
2917667 2920795 Some little town in Pennsylvania<br />called Gettysburg.
3002293 3003336 Here you is, Miss Melanie.
3003378 3006089 They was fightin' for them<br />so it just got tore in half.
3006381 3009175 Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end.
3013096 3016474 Wellman, Wendell, White,<br />Whitner, Wilkins...
3017100 3018351 ...Williams, Woolsey, Workman.
3018393 3020687 Scarlett, you've passed him.
3021271 3023148 Oh, he isn't there!
3023189 3024149 He isn't there!
3024190 3026443 Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.
3026484 3028695 Oh, he's safe, he's safe.
3030488 3034492 Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet<br />to worry about Ashley like this for me.
3042000 3043376 I must go to her.
3044961 3046796 Don't, my dear, not here.
3047797 3049090 Let's go home.
3050467 3052135 Dr. Meade, not....
3052177 3054888 Yes, our boy, Darcy.
3055680 3058266 I was making these mittens for him.
3058975 3060769 He won't need them now.
3061770 3065732 Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show 'em.<br />I'll kill all those Yankees.
3065774 3067233 Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.
3067275 3069527 Do you think it will help your mother<br />to have you off getting shot too?
3069569 3071363 I never heard of anything so silly.
3074074 3077327 It's a black day, Scarlett.<br />You haven't had bad news, have you?
3077369 3078578 Ashley's safe.
3078870 3080538 I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
3080580 3082123 But, Rhett, there are so many others.
3082165 3083124 Many of your friends?
3083166 3086836 Just about every family in the county.<br />The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.
3086878 3090674 Yes, look at them.<br />All these poor tragic people.
3091466 3094969 The South's sinking to its knees.<br />It'll never rise again.
3095762 3097180 The cause....
3097472 3100725 The cause of living in the past is dying<br />right in front of us.
3100767 3102727 I never heard you talk like that before.
3102769 3106773 I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.<br />And that's what all this is, sheer waste.
3109192 3110694 But don't you be downcast.
3110985 3114364 Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home<br />to the women who love him...
3114781 3116199 ...both of them.
3152902 3154362 Oh, you're here.
3157866 3160785 Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.
3161077 3163455 Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.
3163496 3165874 Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.
3169878 3171880 Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.
3173381 3174674 Scarlett, dear.
3177177 3180889 Well, is this any way to greet<br />a returning warrior?
3181264 3182766 Ashley, l....
3186102 3187771 Merry Christmas, Ashley.
3196363 3200200 Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br />We've got all your wives.
3200784 3202827 We've got all your little chicks.
3202869 3205997 You got nobody to worry your head<br />about leavin'.
3206581 3207582 Come on.
3207874 3212337 Now you just stand still so you can be<br />a Christmas gift for the white folks.
3212379 3213672 Now hold on.
3214381 3215382 Hold on!
3216174 3218343 Don't go gettin' so uppity...
3218385 3220762 ...even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.
3223181 3225642 Let's not talk about the war.<br />It's Christmas.
3225684 3229354 Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara<br />and all the times before the war.
3229396 3230939 Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?
3230980 3233441 Why did you say there wasn't enough,<br />Uncle Peter?
3233483 3237153 There's plenty. It's the very last<br />of my father's fine Madeira.
3237195 3241074 He got it from his uncle,<br />Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
3241366 3244953 ...who married his cousin,<br />Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...
3244994 3248373 ...who was his second cousin once removed<br />and a kin to the Wilkeses too.
3248665 3252085 I saved it to wish Ashley<br />a Merry Christmas.
3252669 3256381 But you mustn't drink it all at once<br />because it is the last.
3261302 3263972 I meant it, my dear.<br />It was a lovely Christmas gift.
3264264 3266725 Only generals have tunics like this,<br />nowadays.
3266766 3268560 I'm so happy you like it, dear.
3268601 3270437 Where did you get the cloth?
3270478 3272647 It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.
3272689 3276484 I nursed her son while he was in<br />the hospital, Ashley, before he died and....
3277193 3279779 Oh, you will take good care of it,<br />won't you?
3280071 3282198 You won't let it get torn.
3282699 3283658 Promise me.
3283700 3284868 You mustn't worry.
3285368 3288788 I'll bring it back to you<br />without any holes in it, I promise.
3291791 3292834 Good night, my dear.
3292876 3294669 Good night, Scarlett, darling.
3308391 3310643 Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,<br />for Mr. Ashley to leave?
3310685 3312437 Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
3312479 3316024 She isn't going to the depot with him?<br />She hasn't changed her mind?
3316066 3317734 No, ma'am. She's layin' down.
3317776 3321780 She's so upset Mist' Wilkes told her<br />she can't even come downstairs.
3328370 3329371 Ashley!
3333792 3336169 Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
3336670 3340256 Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you<br />as you are now...
3340298 3342092 ...not shivering at the depot.
3342592 3343802 All right.
3344469 3347263 Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.
3354270 3356272 Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.
3357190 3358900 Tie it on me, my dear.
3360193 3364072 While Melly was making your new tunic,<br />I made this to go with it.
3364489 3365699 You made it yourself?
3366783 3369577 Well, then I shall value it all the more.
3369994 3372997 You know there's nothing<br />I wouldn't do for you.
3373790 3375959 There's something you can do for me.
3376001 3377002 What is it?
3377377 3379462 Will you look after Melanie for me?
3380672 3383675 She's so frail and gentle<br />and she loves you so much.
3384175 3385552 You see, if I were killed and she--
3385593 3389180 Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.<br />Say a prayer quickly.
3389472 3390974 You say one for me.
3391975 3395395 We shall need all our prayers<br />now the end is coming.
3395687 3396730 The end?
3396771 3398189 The end of the war.
3398982 3400900 And the end of our world, Scarlett.
3402277 3405238 But, Ashley, you don't think<br />the Yankees are beating us?
3405280 3408074 Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...
3409200 3411578 ...and the snow in Virginia is deep.
3412370 3413788 When I see them...
3414164 3418585 ...and I see the Yankees coming<br />and coming, always more and more....
3421588 3424299 Well, when the end does come<br />I shall be far away.
3425300 3427802 It'll be a comfort to me to know<br />that she has you.
3428887 3430972 You will promise, won't you?
3433475 3434476 Yes.
3435894 3437562 Is that all, Ashley?
3438563 3441191 All except, goodbye.
3441775 3443735 Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.
3443777 3445028 -You must be brave--<br />-No....
3445070 3446279 You must.
3446863 3448865 How else can I bear going?
3449699 3453370 Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine<br />and strong and beautiful.
3454662 3456581 Not just your sweet face, my dear...
3457582 3459000 ...but you.
3462170 3464381 Oh, Ashley, kiss me.
3465173 3466883 Kiss me goodbye!
3473598 3474557 No, Scarlett.
3474599 3476184 Oh, Ashley, I love you.
3476768 3479688 I've always loved you.<br />I never loved anyone else.
3479979 3482440 I only married Charles just to hurt you.
3482482 3484901 Oh, Ashley. Tell me you love me.
3485902 3488363 I'll live on it the rest of my life.
3490281 3491366 Goodbye.
3511302 3513471 When the war is over, Ashley.
3514264 3516266 When the war is over.
3536494 3538163 And there's a place back home...
3538997 3542167 ...where a wild plum tree comes to flower<br />in the springtime.
3543501 3545170 Down by the creek, you know.
3545670 3547172 Yes, I know, I know.
3548089 3551426 When we were little,<br />my brother, Jeff, and I used to....
3551468 3554971 I told you about my brother, Jeff,<br />didn't l, ma'am?
3555472 3556765 I know I did.
3557182 3558433 He....
3558475 3561394 We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
3561895 3565190 Since Bull Run we haven't heard<br />anything and....
3565690 3568026 Please, we must have<br />your temperature now.
3568068 3570737 Just take this in your mouth<br />and not talk anymore.
3570779 3572280 Not just now.
3572697 3575492 Melanie, I'm so tired I've gotta go home.
3576576 3578286 Aren't you tired, Melanie?
3578787 3581373 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3582082 3583833 This might be...
3583875 3584876 ...Ashley.
3585669 3588463 And only strangers here to comfort him.
3588880 3590882 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3592092 3593802 They could all be...
3594302 3595595 ...Ashley.
3607774 3611736 I've been sittin' by this curb one solid hour<br />waitin' to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.
3611778 3614531 Go on, you trash,<br />don't you be pesterin' these ladies.
3614572 3616157 Don't talk to her, Melly.
3616199 3618535 It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?
3618576 3621329 My name's Belle Watlin'.<br />But that don't matter.
3621371 3623623 I expect you think<br />I've got no business here.
3623665 3626334 Hadn't you best tell me<br />what you want to see me about?
3626376 3629754 First time I come here, I says,<br />"Belle, you're a nurse."
3629796 3631923 But the ladies didn't want<br />my kind of nursin'.
3631965 3634134 Well, they was more than likely right.
3634175 3636052 Then I tried givin' 'em money.
3636094 3638638 My money wasn't good enough<br />for 'em, either.
3638680 3639973 Old pea-hens!
3640473 3642892 I know a gentleman<br />who says you're a human bein'.
3643184 3646855 If you are, which they ain't,<br />you'll take my money for the hospital.
3646896 3650150 What are you doing here?<br />Haven't you been told twice already?
3650191 3652235 This time I'm conversin' with Miss Wilkes.
3652277 3654237 You might as well take my money,<br />Miss Wilkes.
3654279 3656197 It's good money, even if it is mine.
3656489 3658158 I'm sure you're very generous.
3658199 3661327 No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate<br />like everybody else, that's all.
3661369 3662662 Of course you are.
3662996 3665248 There's some folks here<br />wouldn't feel that way.
3665290 3667876 But maybe they ain't<br />as good Christians as you.
3675091 3677886 Look, Mrs. Meade.<br />It's a great deal of money.
3678178 3680388 Ten, $20, $30, $50.
3680764 3683099 And it's not our paper money. It's gold.
3683683 3685393 Let me see that handkerchief.
3685769 3686895 "R. B."
3689397 3692567 And she's driving away<br />in Rhett Butler's carriage!
3693485 3696571 Oh, if I just wasn't a lady<br />what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
3731481 3734442 "The Lord is my Shepherd.<br />I shall not want.
3734484 3737070 "He maketh me to lie down<br />in green pastures.
3737487 3738571 "He leadeth....
3740990 3742575 "He restoreth my soul.
3743284 3746663 "He leadeth me in the paths<br />of righteousness for His name's sake.
3747372 3750583 "Yeah, though I walk through the valley<br />of the shadow of death...
3751001 3752585 "...l will fear no evil.
3752877 3754170 "For Thou art with me.
3754462 3756965 "Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."
3758091 3759092 Yankees!
3759676 3762721 The Yankees!<br />Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
3762762 3767392 They'll never get into Atlanta.<br />They'll never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.
3768393 3770562 Give me something for the pain.
3770979 3772731 Give me something for the pain!
3772772 3774983 Sorry, son, we haven't got anything<br />to give you.
3776985 3779571 These animules is drivin' me crazy!
3781072 3783074 What luck! You've got my jack...!
3783366 3785952 Give me an ace and I'll start another war!
3785994 3787662 I'll bid the moon!
3791374 3795378 That I'll never see you or Pa again.
3796671 3798256 This leg's got to come off, soldier.
3798298 3800842 No, no! Leave me alone!
3800884 3802052 I'm sorry, soldier.
3802093 3803845 We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.
3803887 3805555 Then we'll have to operate without it.
3805597 3807390 No, no! Leave me alone!
3807682 3809934 You can't do it. I won't let you do it to me!
3809976 3812937 Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off<br />immediately. It's gangrene.
3812979 3815357 No, no! Don't!
3815398 3818234 I haven't seen my family in three days.
3818276 3820070 I'm going home for half an hour.
3820487 3822072 Orderly! Give me a lift.
3826284 3828370 Nurse, you can free this bed.
3829371 3830872 Miss Scarlett!
3832665 3834334 Why, Frank Kennedy!
3834376 3836503 Miss Suellen, is she well?
3836795 3840048 When did they bring you in?<br />You all right? Are you badly hurt?
3840090 3842634 -But Miss Suellen, is she--<br />-She's all right, but l--
3842676 3844636 Dr. Wilson needs you<br />in the operating room.
3844678 3847097 He's going to take off that leg.<br />Better hurry.
3848973 3850392 I'll be back.
3851768 3854270 No, no, leave me alone!
3854771 3857482 No, no, I can't stand it!
3857982 3860568 No don't! Don't cut!
3861403 3862779 Don't cut!
3863279 3865073 Don't, don't!
3865490 3866574 Please!
3866866 3868785 Where's the nurse?
3872580 3874040 Mrs. Hamilton, Dr. Wilson's waiting.
3874082 3876626 Let him wait! I'm going home!<br />I've done enough.
3876668 3880088 I don't want any more men dying!<br />I don't want any more!
