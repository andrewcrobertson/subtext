619 3452 It won't be long now<br />before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
3822 5380 Are you doing as well as all that?
5457 7084 Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.
7325 9156 I'm no millionaire yet...
9227 11593 ...but I've cleared $1,000 already.
11896 12988 And lumber too.
13064 14156 Well...
14866 16163 ...that's only a sideline.
16234 17701 A sideline, Frank?
17869 21805 With all the good Georgia pine around<br />Atlanta and all this building going on?
21873 24364 Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...
25377 27470 ...and I've got to be thinking<br />about buying a home.
27545 29103 What do you want a home for?
29180 31273 For Miss Suellen and me<br />to set up housekeeping.
31883 35216 Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her<br />to Atlanta, wouldn't you?
36087 38112 There wouldn't be much help<br />in that for Tara.
39424 42018 I don't rightly know what you mean,<br />Miss Scarlett.
42427 43689 I don't mean a thing.
43762 46959 Frank, how'd you like to drive me out<br />to my Aunt Pitty's?
47899 50197 Nothing would give me<br />more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.
50301 51996 You'd better stay to supper, too.
52070 55437 I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable<br />and I'd like a good long visit with you.
55540 58168 Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,<br />Miss Scarlett.
59411 61402 And will you tell me all the news...
61713 63510 ...all the news of Miss Suellen?
66317 67909 What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?
68219 69743 Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
69821 70981 Oh, no, no.
71523 73457 I thought surely she had written you.
73558 75219 I guess she was ashamed to write you.
75293 76885 She should be ashamed.
76961 79521 Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.
79664 82827 You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
83835 86861 Well, she's going to marry<br />one of the county boys next month.
88406 91864 She just got tired of waiting<br />and was afraid she'd be an old maid and...
92110 94340 Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
95513 98209 Oh, it's colder. I left my muff at home.
98450 101317 Would you mind<br />if I put my hand in your pocket?
117702 120193 But, Melanie, you don't realize<br />what she's done.
120839 122830 She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.
123308 125435 He's my beau,<br />and she's gone and married him.
125510 127740 She did it to save Tara,<br />you must understand that.
127812 129074 I hate Tara!
129147 132412 And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing<br />I hate worse than Tara.
137021 138249 It's all my fault.
139591 142890 I should have committed highway robbery<br />to get that tax money for you.
142961 145327 I couldn't let you do<br />anything like that, and...
145597 147087 Well, anyway, it's done now.
147165 148564 Yes, it's done now.
149634 151329 You wouldn't let me<br />do anything dishonorable...
151402 154064 ...but you'd sell yourself in marriage<br />to a man you didn't love.
155206 158505 Well, at least you won't have to worry<br />about my helplessness anymore.
159501 160661 What do you mean?
161069 162502 I'm going to New York.
164139 166107 I've arranged to get a position<br />in a bank there.
166174 167505 But you can't do that.
169611 172808 I counted on you to help me start<br />a lumber business, Ashley...
172881 174906 ...and, well, I counted on you.
175083 176414 I wouldn't be any good to you.
176485 178146 I don't know anything<br />about the lumber business.
178220 179744 You know as much as you do<br />about banking.
180889 182948 And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.
183859 185622 That's generous of you, Scarlett.
186828 188090 But it isn't that.
188564 190725 If I go to Atlanta<br />and take help from you again...
191767 194167 ...I'd bury forever any hope<br />of standing alone.
194336 195428 Oh, is that all?
195904 199965 Well, you could gradually buy the business<br />and then it would be your own, and...
201310 202607 No, Scarlett.
206214 207238 Ashley...
215257 216224 Ashley.
223932 224990 Scarlett!
226835 228097 Scarlett, what is it?
228270 229862 Ashley's so mean and hateful.
230872 232066 What have you done?
234643 236372 She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
236445 240643 To help me start my lumber business, and<br />he won't lift a finger to help me, and he...
240716 242411 Why, how unchivalrous of you.
242718 244379 Why, think, Ashley, think.
244920 247718 If it hadn't been for Scarlett,<br />I'd have died in Atlanta.
248190 250988 And maybe we wouldn't have had<br />little Beau, and...
251059 254426 ...and when I think of her picking cotton<br />and plowing just to keep food...
254496 255793 ...in our mouths, I could just...
256365 257491 Oh, my darling.
262471 263699 All right, Melanie.
264339 265533 I'll go to Atlanta.
267409 268774 I can't fight you both.
288597 291225 Well, here's your new mill hands,<br />Mrs. Kennedy.
291700 293895 The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
295070 297231 They look pretty thin and weak to me,<br />Gallegher.
297305 297964 Halt!
300942 302432 They're the best you can lease, ma'am.
302511 305207 And if you'll just give Johnny Gallegher<br />a free hand...
305414 307541 ...you'll get what you want out of them.
307816 309545 All right, you're the foreman.
310085 313577 All I ask is, you keep the mill running<br />and deliver my lumber when I want it.
313655 315213 Johnny Gallegher's your man, Miss.
315290 316416 But remember...
316658 319218 ...no questions and no interference.
319661 322289 That's a bargain.<br />Start them in the morning, Gallegher.
322364 324298 Come on, get a move on!<br />Come on, move on there!
324366 326732 But, Scarlett, this isn't right<br />and you know it.
327235 329499 It's bad enough for a woman<br />to be in business, but...
329571 330799 What are you complaining about?
330872 333238 You wouldn't have owned a mill<br />had I not taken over.
333308 335902 I didn't want the mill,<br />and we couldn't have bought it...
335977 339276 ...if you hadn't pressed all of our friends<br />for the money they owed me.
339347 340336 Isn't that right, Ashley?
340415 342645 What are you running,<br />a charitable institution?
342718 345209 Go back to the store,<br />then go home and take your medicine.
345287 346345 You're not looking very well.
346421 348616 But, sugar, shouldn't you come home<br />with me?
348690 352057 Great balls of fire. Don't bother me<br />anymore, and don't call me sugar!
352127 353958 All right, all right.
354496 355986 Good night, Ashley.
358066 360591 She can get mad quicker<br />than any woman I ever saw.
362404 364531 Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...
364606 368064 ...I do wish you'd let me hire free darkies<br />instead of using convicts.
368143 369405 I believe we could do better.
369478 372572 Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,<br />and convicts are dirt cheap.
372647 374274 If we just give Gallegher a free hand...
374349 377785 A free hand! You know what that means.<br />He'll starve them and whip them.
377853 379821 Some of them are sick, underfed...
379888 381515 Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.
381690 384488 Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken<br />three times a day and...
384559 386652 ...tucking them to sleep<br />with eiderdown quilts.
386728 390721 Scarlett, I will not make money out<br />of the enforced labor and misery of others.
390832 392561 You weren't so particular<br />about owning slaves.
392634 395194 That was different.<br />We didn't treat them that way.
395370 397634 Besides, I'd have freed them all<br />when father died...
397706 399697 ...if the war hadn't already freed them.
400008 401305 Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
401710 404144 But have you forgotten<br />what it's like without money?
404212 407079 I found out that money is<br />the most important thing in the world...
407149 409583 ...and I don't intend ever to be<br />without it again.
409651 412586 I'll make enough so the Yankees can never<br />take Tara away from me.
412654 414019 I'll make it the only way I know how.
414089 416614 But we're not the only Southerners<br />who have suffered.
416691 420457 Look at all our friends. They're keeping<br />their honor and their kindness, too.
420529 424192 And they're starving. I've got no use<br />for fools who won't help themselves.
424266 426700 I know what they're saying about me,<br />and I don't care.
426768 428531 I'll make friends<br />with the Yankee carpetbaggers.
428603 431800 And I'll beat them at their own game,<br />and you'll beat them with me.
434209 436643 That's it.<br />Move it a little over to that side.
437579 439012 Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
439214 440203 Good afternoon.
440282 441909 Business is certainly growing, ain't it?
441983 443007 It certainly is.
444653 447588 But you're doing business<br />with the same people who robbed us...
447689 450180 ...and tortured us and left us to starve.
450325 451485 All that's past, Melly.
451560 455052 And I intend to make the best of things,<br />even if they are Yankee things.
457732 461133 And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,<br />that Dr. Meade actually saw her...
461203 463398 ...peddling lumber<br />to those Yankees, herself.
463638 464662 And that isn't all...
464739 467606 I think it's shocking what she's doing<br />to my brother, Ashley.
467676 470201 She's even taken to driving her own buggy.
478019 479714 My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
479788 481517 My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.
482090 484115 I don't see how you have<br />the gall to face me.
484192 485819 When I think you could have had<br />my millions...
485894 487521 ...if you'd just waited a little while.
487596 489257 Oh, how fickle is woman!
489731 492131 What is it you want?<br />I have important things to do.
492200 496398 Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point<br />which has bothered me for some time?
496471 497699 Well, what is it? Be quick.
498173 501574 Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink<br />from marrying men you don't love?
502544 505445 How did you ever get out of jail?<br />Why didn't they hang you?
506381 507848 Oh, that! Not much trouble.
507916 509679 There's nothing much<br />that money won't buy.
509751 512549 I observe it's even bought you<br />the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
513355 515118 So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
515690 517521 Do you know,<br />I believe you're jealous of him.
517592 520390 You still think you're the belle<br />of the county, don't you?
520462 522521 That you're the cutest little trick<br />in shoe leather.
522597 524724 And that every man you meet<br />is dying of love for you.
524799 525857 Let me by!
526601 529263 Don't be angry, Scarlett.<br />Tell me, where are you going?
529771 531636 To the mill, if it's any of your business.
531706 533139 Through shantytown, alone?
533208 536666 Haven't you been told it's dangerous<br />to drive alone through all that riffraff?
536745 538076 Don't worry about me.
538346 541042 I can shoot straight<br />if I don't have to shoot too far.
548723 549690 What a woman!
585126 586684 Could ya gimme a quarter?
586761 588126 Let go of my horse!
590432 591626 Hold this horse!
602610 603668 Help!
604212 605611 Help!
607215 608307 Help!
642550 643847 Miss Scarlett!
662904 665395 Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!
665840 667364 Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!
667442 668466 Big Sam!
668810 670107 Miss Scarlett! Wait!
672814 674213 Sam! Sam!
674682 677207 Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br />Did they hurt you?
678586 682283 Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.<br />Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.
683224 684350 Horse, make tracks!
688396 690796 You get to Tara just as quick as you can,<br />and stay there.
690865 693356 I sure will.<br />I's got enough of them carpetbaggers.
693635 695796 Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br />Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
695870 697497 Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.
697705 701004 Scarlett, change your dress and go over<br />to Miss Melly's for the evening.
701076 702941 I've got to go to a political meeting.
703011 704171 A political meeting!
704279 705837 How can you go to a political meeting...
705914 707609 ...after what I've been through<br />this afternoon?
707682 710173 Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.
710785 714846 Nobody cares about me.<br />You all act as though it was nothing at all.
736644 739306 The men talk, talk, talk<br />about protecting our women...
739614 743448 ...and after what happened to me today<br />Frank has to go to a political meeting.
747589 750149 And if it won't pain you too much,<br />India Wilkes...
750525 753289 ...I'd be much obliged<br />if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.
753361 754828 Has my face gone green or something?
754896 755954 It won't pain me!
756498 759126 What happened this afternoon was<br />just what you deserved!
759200 761327 And if there was any justice,<br />you'd have gotten worse.
761402 762369 India, hush up!
762437 764701 Let her talk, Melanie.<br />She's always hated me!
764772 766296 Ever since I took your brother<br />away from her...
766374 768535 ...though she's too much of a hypocrite<br />to admit it!
768610 770009 If she thought anyone'd go for her...
770078 771636 ...she'd walk down the street naked!
771713 773271 I do hate you!
774215 777378 You've done all you could<br />to lower the prestige of decent people.
777719 780244 Now you've endangered the lives<br />of our men, because they...
780321 781288 India!
781523 785118 I don't think we'd better say any more,<br />or one of us will be saying too much.
785393 788055 What's going on around here<br />that I don't know about?
793902 795563 Somebody's comin' up the walk.
795770 797533 Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
798406 800840 Will you hand me the pistol, please,<br />Mrs. Meade?
807348 808508 Whoever it is...
809751 811048 ...we know nothing.
814789 815915 Where have they gone?
815990 818185 You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />It's life or death!
818259 820489 Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.
820562 822860 Quickly, please! There may still be time.
822931 823989 How did you know?
824065 825828 I've been playing poker<br />with two Yankee captains.
825900 826992 They knew there'd be trouble tonight.
827068 828831 They've sent their cavalry out<br />to be ready for it.
828903 830996 Your husband and his friends are<br />walking into a trap.
831072 833336 Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!
836477 839344 Out the Decatur Road.<br />The old Sullivan plantation.
839781 841476 The house is burned.<br />They're meeting in the cellar.
841549 842846 I'll do what I can.
847755 850656 What's all this about?<br />If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!
851092 852559 We thought it best not to tell you, Scarlett.
852627 855118 But Ashley and Frank and the others<br />have gone to clean out those woods...
855196 856663 ...where you were attacked.
856864 858491 It's what a great many<br />of our Southern gentlemen have had...
858566 860329 ...to do lately for our protection.
860401 863302 And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,<br />Scarlett!
863705 865104 And it will be your fault!
865206 867140 Another word,<br />and you go out of this house, India!
867208 869199 Scarlett did what she thought<br />she had to do.
869277 872041 And our men are doing<br />what they think they have to do.
872814 873906 Frank!
874649 875843 And Ashley!
878219 879516 Oh, it isn't possible!
883391 885882 There's horses, Miss Melly.<br />Here they come.
885994 887586 You're sewing, you're sewing.
892500 893797 Open the door, Mammy.
904012 905843 Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
908283 909841 Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?
909917 911009 I am Mrs. Wilkes.
911853 914287 I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,<br />if you please.
914355 915322 He's not here.
915690 916679 Are you sure?
916758 918658 Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.
918960 920791 I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
921496 924124 If you'll give me your word,<br />I won't search the house.
924198 928066 Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at<br />a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
928136 930764 He's not at the store,<br />and there's no meeting tonight!
931072 932403 No political meeting.
932807 935367 We'll wait outside<br />till he and his friends return.
936911 939846 Sergeant, surround the house.<br />Put a man on each door and window.
939914 940972 Yes, sir!
945586 947417 Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
948323 950621 And I'll read aloud.
954128 957222 "The Personal History and Experience<br />of David Copperfield.
960301 961427 "Chapter one.
961869 962995 "I'm born.
967542 971308 "To begin my life, with the beginning<br />of my life, I record that I was born.
972246 974806 "Chapter Nine.<br />I have a memorable birthday.
974882 976907 "I pass over all that happened at school...
976984 980181 "...until the anniversary of my birthday<br />came around in March.
981389 983983 "Except that Steerforth was more to be<br />admired than ever.
984058 985320 "I remember nothing.
985393 988487 "He was going away at the end<br />of the half year, if not sooner...
988596 991929 "...and was more spirited and independent<br />than before in my eyes...
992367 994801 "...and, therefore, more engaging<br />than before, but...
994869 996769 "...beyond this I remember nothing.
997638 998866 "The great..."
1001242 1002368 "I remember nothing."
1007415 1009110 Melly! They're drunk!
1009917 1011407 Leave this to me, Scarlett.
1011619 1013416 And, please, say nothing.
1016858 1018348 You stupid fool!
1020561 1021687 Quiet!
1022330 1024264 Will you shut up for the love of...?
1024799 1025788 Hello, Melly.
1025967 1028993 So, you've got my husband<br />intoxicated again, Captain Butler!
1029537 1030561 Well, bring him in.
1030638 1033004 I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />Your husband's under arrest.
1033074 1035133 If you arrest all the men<br />who get intoxicated...
1035209 1037074 ...you must have a good many Yankees<br />in jail.
1038045 1040707 Bring him in, Captain Butler.<br />If you can walk yourself.
1042817 1044148 I want to tell you a story...
1044218 1045583 Listen, Doctor, I...
1045920 1047182 Put him there in that chair.
1051292 1053658 And now, Captain Butler,<br />will you please leave my house...
1053728 1056322 ...and try to remember<br />not to come here again?
1056664 1059531 Well, now that's fine thanks I get<br />for bringing him home...
1059834 1062394 ...and not leaving him on the streets<br />in this shameful condition!
1062470 1064097 Now, boys, all together!
1064539 1066063 Dr. Meade...
1066674 1068539 ...I'm astonished at you!
1075316 1077546 Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?
1079387 1081150 I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
1082223 1084851 Take him into the bedroom<br />and lay him out on the bed as usual.
1084926 1086518 Don't touch him, he's under arrest!
1086594 1087583 Now, Tom.
1087695 1089492 What do you want to arrest him for?
1089831 1091492 I've seen him drunker.
1091732 1094326 I've seen you drunker!<br />And you've seen me...
1094402 1097337 He can lie in the gutter for all I care!<br />I'm not a policeman.
1098105 1099868 But he led a raid tonight<br />on that shantytown...
1099941 1102671 ...where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble<br />this afternoon.
1102810 1105836 A lot of those shanties were burned.<br />A couple of men were killed.
1105913 1109781 It's about time you rebels learned you can't<br />take the law into your own hands.
1110051 1111575 What are you laughing at?
1113287 1115812 This isn't your night<br />to teach that lesson, Tom.
1116190 1119057 These two have been<br />with me tonight. Yes, sir.
1119327 1120555 With you, Rhett?
1121629 1122618 Where?
1126701 1129135 I don't like to say in<br />the presence of ladies.
1129604 1130696 You'd better say.
1131339 1133500 Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
1133608 1134734 Speak out, Captain Butler!
1134809 1137505 I think I have a right to know<br />where my husband's been.
1139714 1142979 Well, ma'am, we dropped in<br />on a friend of mine...
1144252 1145583 ...and the captain's.
1146087 1147452 A Mrs. Belle Watling.
1148456 1151550 We played cards, drank champagne and...
1152560 1153618 ...well...
1153694 1157130 Now, you've done it! Did you have to<br />show me up in front of my wife?
1158733 1160598 Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.
1160768 1164101 These ladies won't be on speaking terms<br />with their husbands tomorrow.
1165540 1167565 Rhett, I had no idea, I...
1168910 1172437 Look here, will you take an oath<br />that they were with you tonight at...
1172880 1174006 ...at Belle's?
1174415 1177350 Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.<br />She'll tell you, Captain.
1177418 1179579 Will you give me your word<br />as a gentleman?
1179987 1181079 As a gentleman?
1181422 1182719 Why certainly, Tom.
1185393 1186690 Well, if I...
1186761 1188888 ...if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
1189997 1192363 I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I...
1194068 1196161 If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.
1196237 1198831 Well, I say I'm sorry, and...
1199974 1201601 ...well, I am sorry.
1201676 1203166 Come on, Sergeant.
1209650 1211675 Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
1213821 1214879 Ashley.
1214989 1217389 It's all right. It's only in the shoulder.
1217658 1219956 Get him on the bed<br />where I can dress the wound.
1220027 1221460 I think I can walk.
1222496 1224555 It's not worth the effort. Which way?
1224632 1225690 In here.
1227368 1229336 - Mammy, I want some hot water.<br />- Yes, sir.
1229403 1230870 - And lint for bandages.<br />- I'll find some.
1230938 1233907 Now what can I use for a probe?<br />If I only had my bag.
1233975 1236637 Were you really there?<br />What did it look like?
1237278 1241305 Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br />plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
1241449 1243610 Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br />remember yourself.
1246320 1249517 And now, Captain Butler,<br />tell me what happened, all that happened.
1250057 1251422 I was too late.
1252059 1255586 When I got to the old Sullivan place there'd<br />already been a skirmish with the Yankees.
1255663 1258496 I found Mr. Wilkes wounded<br />and Dr. Meade was with him.
1258866 1262165 I had to prove they had been somewhere,<br />anyplace but where they were.
1263237 1264795 So I took them to Belle's.
1264972 1266200 And she took them in?
1266641 1268836 She's by way of being<br />an old friend of mine.
1269377 1271368 Oh, I'm sorry. L...
1271445 1274141 I'm sorry I couldn't think up<br />a more dignified alibi.
1278085 1281680 This isn't the first time you've come<br />between me and disaster, Captain Butler.
1281756 1284589 It isn't likely that I'd question<br />any device of yours.
1286794 1290059 And now, I'll go and see<br />what Dr. Meade needs.
1295770 1297135 Oh, Ashley!
1298939 1300031 Ashley!
1302076 1305568 Have you no interest in what's become<br />of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?
1308349 1310613 Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
1310851 1311943 No.
1312553 1313645 Well, where is he?
1314622 1316419 He's lying out on Decatur Road...
1317491 1318924 ...shot through the head.
1320127 1321219 He's dead.
1331505 1332563 Who is it?
1333040 1334200 It's Miss Watlin'.
1334408 1336842 Oh, Mrs. Watling!<br />Won't you come in the house?
1337344 1339471 Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.
1340548 1342573 You come in and sit a minute with me.
1350958 1353085 How can I thank you enough<br />for what you did for us?
1353160 1354923 How can any of us thank you enough?
1354995 1358123 I got your note sayin' you was goin'<br />to call on me and thank me.
1358199 1360633 Why, Miss Wilkes,<br />you must have lost your mind.
1361469 1363528 I come up here as soon<br />as it was dark to tell you...
1363604 1365868 ...you mustn't even think of any such thing.
1365940 1366964 Why, I'm...
1367875 1368967 Why, you're...
1369510 1371205 Well, it wouldn't be fittin' at all.
1371278 1375305 It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind<br />woman who saved my husband's life?
1375382 1379751 Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady<br />in this town nice to me like you was.
1380521 1383046 I mean, about the money<br />for the hospital, you know.
1383390 1384982 And I don't forget a kindness.
1385392 1388520 And I got to thinking about you being left<br />a widow with a little boy...
1388596 1390291 ...if Mr. Wilkes got hung...
1390931 1393729 ...and he's a nice little boy,<br />your boy is, Miss Wilkes.
1394568 1397093 I got a boy myself and so I...
1397705 1399798 Oh, you have? Does he live...?
1399974 1402238 Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.
1403444 1404877 He ain't never been here.
1405412 1407346 He's off at school.
1407815 1409840 I ain't seen him since he was little.
1412853 1416846 Well, anyway, if it had been<br />that Miss Kennedy's husband by hisself...
1417158 1420594 ...I wouldn't have lifted a finger to,<br />no matter what Captain Butler said.
1420661 1422595 She's a mighty cold woman.
1422663 1424824 Prancin' about Atlanta by herself.
1425266 1427598 She killed her husband<br />same as if she shot him.
1428235 1430897 You mustn't say unkind things<br />about my sister-in-law.
1434542 1436533 Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.
1436844 1438573 I forgot how you liked her.
1439814 1443841 But she just ain't in the same class<br />with you and I can't help it if I think so.
1444652 1446916 Well, anyway, I gotta be goin'.
1447955 1451721 I'm scared somebody'll recognize<br />this carriage if I stayed here any longer.
1451792 1453589 That wouldn't do you no good.
1454495 1455928 And Miss Wilkes...
1456463 1459694 ...if you ever see me on the street,<br />you don't have to speak to me.
1460467 1461764 I'll understand.
1462603 1466403 I should be proud to speak to you.<br />Proud to be under obligation to you.
1467741 1469106 I hope we meet again.
1469543 1471773 Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fittin'.
1474014 1476539 - Good night, Miss Wilkes.<br />- Good night, Mrs. Watling.
1482223 1484282 And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
1484391 1486689 She's brokenhearted about her husband.
1530971 1533235 Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.
1559466 1561764 <i>Miss Scarlett, Captain Butler here<br />to see you.</i>
1562036 1564163 <i>I told him you was prostrate with grief.</i>
1564271 1566899 Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
1597504 1598869 She says she's comin'.
1599306 1601706 I don't know why she's comin'.<br />But she's a-comin'.
1601775 1603265 You don't like me, Mammy.
1603344 1606575 Now don't you argue with me, you don't.<br />You really don't.
1618659 1620058 It's no good, Scarlett.
1620694 1621626 What?
1621695 1622753 The cologne.
1623230 1625391 I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
1625899 1629062 I mean you've been drinking.<br />Brandy. Quite a lot.
1630004 1632529 Well, what if I have?<br />Is that any of your affair?
1635142 1636769 Don't drink alone, Scarlett.
1636977 1639878 People always find out<br />and it ruins the reputation.
1646387 1647513 What is it?
1647588 1649556 This is more than losing old Frank.
1650024 1651389 Oh, Rhett...
1651458 1652516 ...I'm so afraid.
1652893 1655589 I don't believe it.<br />You've never been afraid in your life.
1655662 1657129 I'm afraid now.
1657398 1659491 I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
1661368 1664303 You look pretty healthy,<br />and maybe there isn't any hell.
1664371 1667568 Oh, there is. I know there is.<br />I was raised on it.
1668509 1671603 Well, far be it from me to question<br />the teachings of childhood.
1672212 1674908 Tell me what you've done<br />that hell yawns before you.
1676417 1678885 I ought never to have married Frank<br />to begin with.
1679219 1681687 He was Suellen's beau<br />and he loved her, not me.
1682589 1685319 And I made him miserable.<br />And I killed him.
1685859 1687793 Yes, I did! I killed him!
1691231 1695895 For the first time I'm finding out what it is<br />to be sorry for something I've done.
1696437 1698428 Here. Dry your eyes.
1699673 1702608 If you had it all to do over again,<br />you'd do no differently.
1702676 1705304 You're like the thief who isn't<br />the least bit sorry he stole...
1705379 1708212 ...but he's terribly, terribly sorry<br />he's going to jail.
1708449 1710417 I'm glad Mother's dead.
1711151 1713813 I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
1714822 1717586 I always wanted to be like her,<br />calm and kind and...
1718792 1721283 And I certainly have<br />turned out disappointing.
1723197 1726758 You know, Scarlett, I think you're<br />on the verge of a crying jag.
1734708 1737472 So I'll change the subject<br />and say what I came to say.
1737978 1739445 Say it, then, and get out!
1740881 1741848 What is it?
1741949 1744213 That I can't go on any longer without you.
1744885 1749015 You are the most ill-bred man to come here<br />at a time like this with your filthy...
1749089 1751580 I made up my mind that you were<br />the only woman for me...
1751658 1753558 ...the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.
1753627 1755891 Now that you've got the lumber mill<br />and Frank's money...
1755963 1758193 ...you won't come to me<br />as you did to the jail.
1758398 1760366 So I see I shall have to marry you.
1761235 1762896 I never heard of such bad taste.
1762970 1765336 Would you be more convinced<br />if I fell to my knees?
1765405 1767236 Turn me loose, you varmint,<br />and get out of here!
1767307 1770276 Forgive me for startling you<br />with the impetuosity of my sentiments...
1770344 1773006 ...my dear Scarlett.<br />I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
1773313 1776441 But it cannot have escaped your notice<br />that for some time past...
1776517 1779850 ...the friendship I have felt for you<br />has ripened into a deeper feeling.
1779920 1783321 A feeling more beautiful,<br />more pure, more sacred.
1784491 1786584 Dare I name it? Can it be love?
1787227 1789718 Get up off your knees.<br />I don't like your common jokes.
1789897 1791592 This is an honorable proposal of marriage...
1791665 1794190 ...made at what I consider<br />a most opportune moment.
1795335 1798304 I can't go all my life waiting<br />to catch you between husbands.
1798939 1801100 You're coarse, and you're conceited.
1802109 1804669 And I think this conversation<br />has gone far enough.
1805612 1808080 Besides, I shall never marry again.
1809149 1811617 Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.
1812186 1813915 You? You!
1814655 1816020 I don't love you!
1816523 1818787 And I don't like being married.
1819760 1821990 Did you ever think of marrying just for fun?
1822196 1825563 Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.<br />Fun for men, you mean.
1826800 1828495 Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?
1828569 1830764 You've been married to a boy<br />and an old man.
1831071 1834131 Why not try a husband of the right age,<br />with a way with women?
1835008 1839502 You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know<br />I shall always love another man.
1840847 1844112 Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?<br />Stop it! No more of that talk.
1850490 1851957 Rhett, don't, I shall faint.
1852025 1854687 I want you to faint.<br />This is what you were meant for.
1854928 1857692 None of the fools you've known<br />have kissed you like this, have they?
1857764 1860358 Your Charles, or your Frank,<br />or your stupid Ashley.
1868909 1872003 Say you're going to marry me.<br />Say "yes." Say "yes!"
1872246 1873270 Yes.
1875582 1878073 Are you sure you meant it?<br />You don't want to take it back?
1878151 1879175 No.
1879820 1881947 Look at me and try to tell me the truth.
1882522 1884513 Did you say "yes" because of my money?
1885125 1886092 Well...
1886360 1887793 Yes. Partly.
1889062 1890154 Partly?
1890864 1895597 Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,<br />and, of course I am fond of you.
1895769 1896793 Fond of me.
1896870 1900328 Well, if I said I was madly in love with you,<br />you'd know I was lying...
1900474 1902339 ...but you always said<br />we had a lot in common...
1902409 1903899 Yes, you're right, my dear.
1904411 1906743 I'm not in love with you any more<br />than you are with me.
1906813 1909077 Heaven help the man<br />who ever really loves you.
1909816 1911716 What kind of a ring would you like,<br />my darling?
1911785 1914982 Oh, a diamond ring.<br />And do buy a great big one, Rhett.
1915055 1918047 You shall have the biggest<br />and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
1918358 1920349 I'll take you to New Orleans<br />for the most expensive honeymoon...
1920460 1921984 ...my ill-gotten gains can buy.
1922062 1923552 Oh, that would be just heavenly.
1923797 1925822 And I think I'll buy your trousseau<br />for you, too.
1925932 1927524 Rhett, how wonderful, but...
1928302 1930463 ...you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?
1930937 1932404 Still the little hypocrite.
1935142 1937235 Rhett, aren't you going<br />to kiss me goodbye?
1937311 1940007 Don't you think you've had enough kissing<br />for one afternoon?
1940080 1941172 You're impossible.
1941248 1943648 You can go and I don't care<br />if you never come back.
1943717 1945048 But I will come back.
1960033 1962092 What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
1962202 1964067 I'm thinking about how rich we are.
1966073 1968405 Rhett, I can keep<br />the lumber business too, can't I?
1968475 1970670 Yes, of course, you can, if it amuses you.
1970944 1973572 Now that you're rich<br />you can tell everyone to go to the devil...
1973647 1975046 ...as you've always said you wanted to.
1975449 1978009 But you were the main one<br />I wanted to go to the devil.
1995836 1999294 Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.<br />I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
1999606 2003064 Oh, Rhett, can I have one of those<br />chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?
2003577 2006876 If you don't stop being such a glutton,<br />you'll get as fat as Mammy...
2006980 2008413 ...then I'll divorce you.
2009249 2011979 Wouldn't it be nice if you bought<br />something for Mammy, too?
2012052 2015044 Why should I buy her a present<br />when she called us both mules?
2015789 2017120 Mules? Why mules?
2017424 2021292 Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,<br />and get ourselves all slicked up...
2021361 2023591 ...like racehorses but we were just mules<br />in horse harness...
2023663 2025255 ...and we didn't fool anybody.
2026299 2028096 I never heard anything more true.
2028168 2029726 Mammy's a smart old soul...
2030036 2033335 ...and one of the few people I know<br />whose respect I'd like to have.
2034474 2036305 I won't give her a thing.<br />She doesn't deserve it.
2036376 2038105 Then I'll take her a petticoat.
2038211 2040406 My Mammy always said<br />when she went to heaven...
2040480 2044439 ...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,<br />so stiff that it would stand by itself...
2044718 2047744 ...and so rustly, the Lord would think<br />it was made of angels' wings.
2047821 2050881 Why, she won't take it from you.<br />She'd rather die than wear it.
2051057 2053821 That may be, but I'm making the gesture<br />just the same.
2058532 2060727 Wake up! Wake up!
2062502 2064402 You were having another nightmare.
2065705 2066729 Oh, Rhett.
2067140 2069335 When I was so cold and hungry and...
2069409 2070899 ...and so tired I...
2071511 2075470 ...I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist<br />and I couldn't find it.
2076316 2078307 - Find what, honey?<br />- Oh, I don't know.
2079085 2081610 I always dream the same dream<br />and I never know.
2082255 2084086 It seems to be hidden in the mist.
2084324 2085416 Darling.
2086726 2090856 Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream<br />that I've found it and that I'm safe?
2092199 2096295 Dreams don't work that way, but when<br />you get used to being safe and warm...
2096770 2098670 ...you'll stop dreaming that dream.
2099072 2102098 And, Scarlett, I'm going to see<br />that you are safe.
2106413 2108677 Would you do something<br />for me if I asked you?
2109149 2110343 You know I would.
2111585 2113883 Will you take me away from here?
2114221 2115688 Don't you like New Orleans?
2115755 2119282 Oh, I love New Orleans,<br />but I want to go home and visit Tara.
2120694 2122252 Will you take me to Tara?
2123063 2127557 Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.<br />We'll go tomorrow.
2130971 2133769 You get your strength<br />from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.
2133840 2135899 You're part of it, and it's part of you.
2135976 2139537 Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara<br />the way it was before the war.
2139779 2142680 Would you?<br />Then go ahead and make it that way.
2143216 2146515 Spend whatever you want,<br />make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
2147120 2148610 Oh, Rhett.
2149222 2150712 Rhett, you are good to me.
2151057 2153389 And can we still have<br />our big new house in Atlanta?
2153460 2156020 Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want...
2156496 2158862 ...marbled terraces, stained-glass windows<br />and all.
2158932 2160832 Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?
2160901 2164029 I want everybody who's been mean to me<br />to be pea-green with envy.
2165872 2170036 I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,<br />building that new house just to show off...
2170176 2172406 ...and even taking our servants.
2173380 2176281 Oh, darling, you mustn't think<br />unkindly of her.
2176750 2179344 She's made it possible for us<br />to keep Tara always.
2179853 2181445 Yes, and what good is Tara?
2181922 2185483 She's had three husbands<br />and I'll be an old maid.
2188495 2190326 Great Jehosophat!
2191131 2192826 Great Jehosophat!
2193233 2195258 Lordsy, we sure is rich now!
2195468 2196560 It ain't quality...
2197037 2199232 But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?
2200006 2202440 I'm entitled to at least see<br />what my own child looks like.
2202509 2206001 You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.<br />You'll be seein' it for a long time.
2206813 2209543 I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,<br />about it's not being a boy.
2209616 2211846 Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.<br />Who wants a boy?
2212152 2215349 Boys aren't any use to anybody.<br />Don't you think I'm proof of that?
2216122 2217953 Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.
2218024 2220549 Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
2220860 2222191 She sure is.
2223096 2224723 Did you ever see a prettier one?
2224798 2228734 Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh<br />that pretty when she come, but not quite.
2229169 2230602 Have another glass, Mammy.
2235275 2237368 What's that rustling noise I hear?
2237444 2241642 Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothin' but<br />my red silk petticoat you done give me.
2241748 2244842 Nothing but your petticoat.<br />I don't believe it. Let me see.
2244918 2246078 Pull up your skirt.
2246586 2248178 Mr. Rhett. You is bad.
2249222 2250314 Yeah, oh, Lord!
2256396 2258956 You sure took a long enough time<br />about wearing it.
2259633 2261260 Yes, sir, too long.
2261968 2263936 No more mule in horse's harness?
2264237 2267206 Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad<br />tellin' you about that.
2267540 2270100 You ain't holdin' that<br />against old Mammy, is you?
2270543 2273376 No, I ain't holding it against you.<br />I just wanted to know.
2273446 2276210 Have another glass, Mammy.<br />Here, take the whole bottle.
2276416 2278850 Dr. Meade says you may go in now,<br />Captain Butler.
2282756 2284690 This sure is a happy day to me.
2284991 2287824 I done diapered three generations<br />of this family's girls...
2288294 2290353 ...and it sure is a happy day.
2290530 2293897 Oh, yes, Mammy.<br />The happiest days are when babies come.
2293967 2295127 I wish...
2295702 2298865 Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.<br />What do you suppose they'll name her?
2298972 2301372 Miss Scarlett done<br />told me if it was a girl...
2301474 2304534 ...she's goin' to name it Eugenia Victoria.
2305378 2306470 Yes...
2306680 2308614 ...she's a beautiful baby...
2309382 2311782 ...the most beautiful baby ever.
2312852 2314046 Yes.
2315588 2317920 Do you know that this is your birthday?
2318625 2320786 That you're a week old today?
2321428 2326593 Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes<br />of which this town has never seen.
2327300 2330428 Yes, I'm gonna send her<br />to the best schools in Charleston.
2330904 2335000 Yes. And her'll be received<br />by the best families in the South.
2335775 2338266 And when it comes time for her to marry...
2338344 2341279 ...well, she'll be a little princess.
2342215 2344149 You certainly are making a fool of yourself.
2344451 2345713 And why shouldn't I?
2346753 2349654 She's the first person<br />who's ever completely belonged to me.
2351057 2352752 Great balls of fire!
2352826 2354350 I had the baby, didn't I?
2355295 2356853 <i>It's Melanie. May I come in?</i>
2356930 2357954 Come in, Melly.
2358164 2361565 Yes, come in and look at my daughter's<br />beautiful blue eyes.
2363870 2366703 But, Captain Butler, most babies have<br />blue eyes when they're born.
2366773 2369742 Don't try to tell him anything.<br />He knows everything about babies.
2369809 2372903 Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br />and they're going to stay blue.
2373079 2374979 As blue as the bonnie blue flag.
2375982 2378280 That's it. That's what we'll call her.
2378551 2379711 Bonnie Blue Butler.
2388528 2389654 Try again, Mammy.
2397737 2398863 Twenty inches.
2399372 2402341 Twenty inches!<br />I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
2402976 2405501 You've simply got to make it<br />18 and a half again, Mammy.
2405578 2407102 You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...
2407180 2409546 ...and you ain't never goin' to be<br />no 18 and a half inches again.
2409616 2411982 Never. And there ain't nothin'<br />to do about it.
2413186 2415177 There is something to do about it!
2415421 2418049 I'm just not going to get old and fat<br />before my time.
2419159 2421093 I just won't have any more babies!
2422028 2425088 I heard Mr. Rhett say<br />that he'll be wantin' a son next year.
2425832 2428665 Go tell Captain Butler<br />I've decided not to go out after all.
2428735 2430362 I'll have supper in my room.
2451024 2454755 I got your message.<br />I'll have them bring my supper up here too.
2461768 2463463 No objections to that, I hope?
2463570 2464696 No.
2465972 2466939 Yes.
2468942 2471274 I mean, I don't care<br />where you have your supper.
2474080 2475104 Rhett?
2476049 2477016 Yes?
2477083 2478107 You see...
2478685 2480346 ...well, I've decided...
2482589 2484921 ...well, I hope I don't have<br />any more children.
2497704 2500605 My pet, as I told you<br />before Bonnie was born...
2501507 2504499 ...it's immaterial to me<br />whether you have one child or 20!
2504611 2506101 No, but you know what I...
2506846 2508404 Do you know what I mean?
2508514 2511574 I do. And do you know<br />I can divorce you for this?
2512819 2515049 You're just low enough<br />to think of something like that!
2515121 2518887 If you had any chivalry in you or would<br />be nice like, well, look at Ashley Wilkes!
2518958 2521483 Melanie can't have any more children<br />and he...
2523897 2526593 You've been to the lumber office<br />this afternoon, haven't you?
2526666 2528361 What has that got to do with it?
2529969 2533234 Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br />Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.
2533439 2535669 It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
2536976 2538967 You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
2539045 2540103 Sorry for me?
2540346 2543907 Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing<br />away happiness with both hands...
2544017 2546451 ...and reaching out for something<br />that will never make you happy.
2546519 2548111 I don't know what you're talking about.
2548187 2551122 If you were free and Miss Melly were dead<br />and you had your precious...
2551190 2554091 ...honorable Ashley, do you think<br />you'd be happy with him?
2555361 2558353 You'd never know him,<br />never even understand his mind...
2559098 2562033 ...any more than you understand anything<br />except money.
2562368 2564336 Never mind about that!<br />What I want to know is...
2564404 2567931 You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.<br />It'll work no hardship on me.
2568841 2570365 Do you mean to say you don't care?
2570443 2574004 The world is full of many things<br />and many people, and I shan't be lonely.
2574681 2576239 I'll find comfort elsewhere.
2576683 2578514 Well, that's fine. But I warn you.
2578751 2581686 Just in case you change your mind,<br />I intend to lock my door.
2581988 2585446 Why bother? If I wanted to come in,<br />no lock could keep me out!
2604077 2607410 I always knew that most women<br />were cheats, hypocritical and hard.
2607547 2609981 - But this one...<br />- Rhett, it ain't no use.
2610049 2612745 - What do you mean?<br />- I mean you're poisoned with her.
2613019 2616352 I don't care what she's done to you,<br />you're still in love with her.
2616456 2618356 And don't think it pleasures me none<br />to say it.
2618424 2621325 Maybe so! But I'm through with her,<br />I tell you! I'm through.
2621394 2624659 You gotta think of the child.<br />The child's worth ten of the mother.
2631337 2634033 You're a shrewd woman, Belle,<br />and a very nice one.
2636209 2637198 Yes, Rhett?
2637276 2640177 I was just thinking of the difference<br />between you, and...
2640913 2644314 ...you're both hard-headed business women<br />and you're both successful.
2644450 2646281 But you've got a heart, Belle...
2648187 2649484 ...and you're honest.
2652258 2653418 Goodbye, Rhett.
2654727 2655955 Goodbye, Belle.
2671844 2674005 She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!
2674247 2676272 Look at those hands, and that seat!
2676582 2677879 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
2678051 2680986 Just why we have to wheel the baby<br />when we have a house full of servants...
2681054 2682112 Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
2682188 2683712 Good morning, Captain Butler.
2683790 2685121 Good morning, Scarlett.
2685191 2688092 Making fools of ourselves<br />in front of these old buffaloes!
2688227 2691094 If you'd thought of your position years ago,<br />you wouldn't have to do this.
2691164 2695396 But as it is, we'll cultivate every female<br />dragon of the old guard in this town.
2696402 2697801 Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
2697870 2701169 Good morning, Captain Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
2701941 2704671 So the millionaire speculator's<br />turning respectable!
2705378 2707573 All of our money can't buy<br />what I want for Bonnie.
2707647 2709877 Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.
2709949 2712281 But Bonnie's going to have a place<br />among decent people.
2712351 2715946 Yes, even if we both have to crawl<br />on our bellies to every fat old cat.
2716923 2718618 Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
2718925 2721587 Good morning, Captain Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
2728134 2731069 Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had<br />a great regard for your knowledge.
2731137 2732832 I wonder if you could give me some advice.
2732905 2733894 Why, certainly, Captain Butler.
2733973 2736271 My Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br />I can't make her stop it.
2736342 2738776 You should make her stop it.<br />It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
2738845 2739903 I know, I know.
2740012 2743573 She has such a beautiful mouth, too.<br />I tried putting soap under her nails.
2743716 2744808 Soap! Bah!
2744884 2748376 Put quinine on her thumb<br />and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
2748621 2751146 Quinine! I never would have thought of it.
2751557 2753684 I can't thank you enough,<br />Mrs. Merriwether.
2753759 2756853 You've taken a great load off my mind!<br />Good morning.
2760600 2761862 Good morning, Dolly.
2762034 2763501 Wasn't that Captain Butler?
2763736 2766204 Good morning, Caroline.<br />I was just thinking.
2766672 2770699 There must be a great deal of good<br />in a man who could love a child so much.
2770843 2772470 But of course there is!
2772778 2776509 Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing<br />told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler...
2776616 2779346 ...finally admitted he was honored<br />by the Confederate Congress...
2779418 2781545 ...for his services at<br />the Battle of Franklin?
2781621 2785079 No! And did I tell you, Caroline,<br />that Captain Butler...
2785191 2788388 ...made a stupendous contribution<br />to the Association for the Beautification...
2788461 2790395 ...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
2790463 2791452 No!
2792198 2795895 My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,<br />is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
2796135 2798899 Why, Dolly Merriwether,<br />you know right well it was my idea...
2798971 2800336 ...to give a party for Bonnie Butler!
2800406 2801737 Why Caroline Meade...
2810950 2813885 Now watch Daddy put your pony over,<br />Bonnie. Now watch.
2817123 2819421 Daddy, let me! Let me!
2819592 2821924 All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!
2825631 2826757 Up we go.
2827099 2828396 Oh, there!
2828701 2831226 Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!
2831337 2834636 Grip tightly with your legs and sit close.<br />Lean forward and be sure you go with him.
2834707 2837505 Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.<br />Up!
2838678 2840908 That was fine! I knew you'd do it!
2841214 2844081 When you get a little older,<br />I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
2844150 2847608 You'll be the greatest horsewoman<br />in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
2848754 2850051 Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!
2851190 2852214 Mr. Rhett!
2853226 2855456 Did you see her, Mammy?<br />Wasn't she wonderful?
2855895 2859831 Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you<br />it just ain't fittin'...
2859899 2862993 ...for a girl child to ride astraddle<br />with her dress flyin' up!
2863169 2865535 All right, Mammy.<br />I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
2865605 2868836 And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.<br />She'll love that.
2868908 2871206 A nice black broadcloth is<br />what little girls wear.
2871277 2873404 Now, Mammy, be reasonable.
2873913 2876108 Well, I don't think it's fittin', but...
2878150 2880277 It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.
2882054 2883351 It ain't fittin'.
2893566 2894794 Why, Scarlett!
2895568 2897559 What are you doing downtown<br />at this time of day?
2897637 2898604 Ashley, I just...
2898704 2902071 Why aren't you helping Melly get ready<br />for my surprise birthday party?
2902341 2905640 Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed<br />to know anything about that.
2906078 2908638 Melly'd be so disappointed<br />if you weren't surprised.
2908814 2912011 I won't let on.<br />I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
2913185 2915312 As long as you're here,<br />let me show you the books...
2915388 2918186 ...so you can see just how bad<br />a businessman I really am.
2918257 2920418 Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.
2920726 2923286 When I'm wearing a new bonnet,<br />all the figures I ever knew...
2923362 2925091 ...go right slap out of my head.
2925164 2928395 The figures are well lost<br />when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.
2928868 2931837 Scarlett, you know,<br />you get prettier all the time.
2932805 2936639 You haven't changed a bit since the day<br />of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
2937176 2940111 ...where you sat under a tree<br />surrounded by dozens of beaux.
2942248 2944648 That girl doesn't exist anymore.
2945151 2947711 Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.
2948054 2949146 Nothing.
2949855 2953552 Yes, we've travelled a long road<br />since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?
2954226 2955784 Oh, the lazy days...
2956028 2958223 ...the warm, still country twilights...
2959532 2962092 ...the high, soft negro laughter<br />from the quarters...
2963336 2966567 ...the golden warmth and security<br />of those days.
2968808 2970275 Don't look back, Ashley.
2971010 2972170 Don't look back.
2974313 2979012 It drags at your heart<br />till you can't do anything, but look back.
2984156 2986249 I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
2987526 2990518 I'd never want you to be anything<br />but completely happy.
3010983 3012041 Oh, Ashley!
3014620 3015644 Who is it?
3015721 3016915 <i>Only your husband.</i>
3018023 3018819 Come in.
3020092 3022526 Am I actually being invited<br />into the sanctuary?
3024096 3026030 You're not ready for Melanie's party.
3026565 3028032 I've got a headache, Rhett.
3028167 3030635 You go without me,<br />and make my excuses to Melanie.
3032638 3035106 What a white-livered little coward you are!<br />Get up!
3035608 3038202 You're going to that party<br />and you'll have to hurry.
3038644 3040509 - Has India dared to...<br />- Yes. India has!
3040579 3042570 Every woman and man in town<br />knows the story!
3042648 3044081 You should kill them, spreading lies.
3044150 3046846 I have a strange way of not killing people<br />who tell the truth.
3046919 3048250 There's no time to argue now. Get up!
3048320 3051483 I won't go! I can't go<br />until this misunderstanding is cleared up.
3051557 3054151 You won't cheat Miss Melly<br />out of the satisfaction of publicly...
3054226 3055625 ...ordering you out of her house.
3055694 3057423 There was nothing wrong.<br />India hates me so.
3057496 3059396 I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.
3059465 3062957 If you don't show it tonight,<br />you'll never be able to as long as you live.
3063035 3065936 While that wouldn't bother me,<br />you're ruining Bonnie's chances.
3066005 3069338 You're going to that party,<br />if only for her sake. Now, get dressed!
3082888 3086289 Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly<br />will do for this occasion.
3086826 3089818 And put on plenty of rouge.<br />I want you to look your part tonight.
3097102 3102233 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow
3102408 3107436 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny
3107880 3111577 "Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny
3112318 3114752 "For he's a jolly good fellow..."
3116555 3119080 - Good night, Scarlett.<br />- But Rhett, you can't...
3119158 3122127 You go into the arena alone.<br />The lions are hungry for you.
3122328 3123920 Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.
3123996 3125156 You're not afraid?
3125364 3127491 "Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny
3127566 3132128 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow
3132238 3137505 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny."
3152024 3154049 What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.
3154393 3156054 India wasn't able to come tonight.
3156128 3157356 Will you be an angel?
3157429 3159920 I do need you to help me<br />receive my guests.
3163736 3165169 Mrs. Meade...
3165404 3167031 ...here's our darling Scarlett.
3169074 3170132 Good evening.
3170242 3171300 Good evening.
3171577 3172635 Why Scarlett!
3173412 3176279 - Good evening, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good evening, Mrs. Butler.
3177049 3180177 Ashley, aren't you going to get<br />our Scarlett a glass of punch?
3188127 3191062 Did you have a good time tonight<br />at Miss Melly's party, child?
3191130 3192154 Yes, yes.
3192231 3194096 Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word...
3194166 3197260 ...if Captain Butler asks for me<br />when he comes back, I'm asleep.
3197636 3198603 Yes, ma'am.
3228067 3229364 <i>Come in, Mrs. Butler.</i>
3238877 3240003 Come here.
3255894 3256918 Sit down!
3259598 3263227 There's no reason why you shouldn't have<br />your nightcap even if I am here.
3263369 3265530 I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and...
3265604 3267367 You heard nothing of the kind.
3267940 3270670 You wouldn't have come down<br />if you'd thought I was here.
3270809 3273039 - You must need a drink badly.<br />- I do not!
3273112 3275910 Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
3275981 3279041 I know you drink on the quiet,<br />and I know how much you drink.
3279485 3281783 Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
3288927 3290258 You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!
3290329 3291819 I'm very drunk...
3292164 3295361 ...and I intend getting still drunker<br />before the evening's over...
3296101 3298831 ...but you're not going to bed, not yet!
3300105 3301231 Sit down!
3304443 3306377 So she stood by you, did she?
3307613 3311208 How does it feel to have the woman<br />you've wronged cloak your sins for you?
3312885 3315581 You're wondering if she knows<br />all about you and Ashley.
3316121 3318715 You're wondering if she did it<br />just to save her face.
3319358 3322987 You're thinking that she's a fool for<br />doing it even if it did save your hide.
3323062 3325223 - I will not listen.<br />- Yes, you'll listen!
3326298 3328698 Miss Melly's a fool,<br />but not the kind you think.
3329601 3332764 It's just that there's too much honor in her<br />to ever conceive of dishonor...
3332838 3334430 ...in anyone she loves.
3335340 3336602 And she loves you.
3337376 3340209 Though just why she does,<br />I'm sure I don't know!
3341380 3344645 If you weren't so drunk and insulting,<br />I could explain everything.
3345117 3348018 - As it is though...<br />- If you get out of that chair once more!
3352424 3357054 Of course, the comic figure in all this is<br />the long suffering Mr. Wilkes!
3358097 3361066 Mr. Wilkes, who can't be<br />mentally faithful to his wife...
3361166 3363726 ...and won't be unfaithful<br />to her technically.
3365404 3367167 Why doesn't he make up his mind?
3367272 3368364 Rhett, you...
3371810 3374210 Observe my hands, my dear.
3375214 3377648 I could tear you to pieces with them.
3378317 3381844 And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley<br />out of your mind forever.
3382921 3384479 But it wouldn't.
3385324 3389090 So I'll remove him<br />from your mind forever this way.
3390295 3392388 I'll put my hands so...
3393265 3395392 ...one on each side of your head...
3396401 3400462 ...and I'll smash your skull between them<br />like a walnut.
3401273 3403503 And that'll block him out.
3404777 3407473 Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.
3412751 3415982 You know I've always admired<br />your spirit, my dear.
3416955 3419253 Never more than now,<br />when you're cornered.
3420425 3421585 I'm not cornered.
3421860 3424693 And you'll never corner me,<br />Rhett Butler, or frighten me!
3424763 3427926 You've lived in dirt so long,<br />you can't understand anything else.
3428333 3432064 And you're jealous of something<br />you can't understand. Good night!
3434606 3435971 Jealous, am I?
3436074 3437598 Yes, I suppose I am.
3438477 3441503 Even though I know you've been faithful<br />to me all along.
3442114 3443342 How do I know?
3443482 3446645 Because I know Ashley Wilkes,<br />and his honorable breed.
3447252 3448344 They're gentlemen!
3448987 3451649 And that's more than I can say<br />for you or for me!
3452658 3456185 We're not gentlemen,<br />and we have no honor, have we?
3465838 3467931 It's not that easy, Scarlett.
3472277 3474245 You turned me out<br />while you chased Ashley Wilkes.
3474313 3476110 While you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.
3476181 3478411 This is one night<br />you're not turning me out!
3506912 3509039 How are you feeling this morning, Mammy?
3509114 3512982 Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.
3515954 3518479 You actin' mighty happy this mornin',<br />Miss Scarlett.
3518624 3520091 I am, Mammy. I am.
3527232 3532067 "Oh, she wept with delight<br />when he gave her a smile
3532571 3537133 "And trembled with fear at his frown."
3554026 3555050 Hello.
3557896 3561491 I'd like to extend my apologies<br />for my conduct of last night.
3561767 3562961 Oh, but Rhett...
3563468 3564696 I was very drunk...
3564770 3568035 ...and quite swept off my feet<br />by your charms.
3570275 3573836 Well, you needn't bother to apologize.<br />Nothing you ever do surprises me!
3574546 3577344 I've been thinking things over,<br />and I really believe that...
3577416 3578906 ...it would be better for both of us...
3578984 3581714 ...if we admitted we'd made a mistake<br />and got a divorce.
3581920 3583182 - A divorce?<br />- Yes.
3583689 3586317 There's no point in our holding on<br />to each other, is there?
3586391 3588916 I'll provide for you amply.<br />You've plenty of grounds.
3588994 3591827 Just give me Bonnie. You can say<br />what you please, I won't contest it.
3591897 3592886 Thank you very much.
3592965 3595991 But I wouldn't dream of disgracing<br />the family with a divorce.
3596735 3599226 You'd disgrace it quick enough<br />if Ashley were free.
3599304 3602296 It makes my head spin to think<br />how quickly you'd divorce me.
3603442 3604841 Wouldn't you, Scarlett?
3606278 3607506 Well, answer me.
3607579 3608603 Wouldn't you?
3608680 3610910 Will you please go now,<br />and leave me alone?
3612451 3614783 Yes, I'm going.<br />That's what I came to tell you.
3615787 3619188 I'm going on a very extended trip<br />to London, and I'm leaving today.
3620525 3622186 And I'm taking Bonnie with me.
3622260 3624728 So you'll please get<br />her little duds packed right away.
3624796 3627026 You'll never take my child<br />out of this house.
3627432 3629297 She's my child, too, Scarlett.
3629401 3631494 You're making a mistake,<br />if you think I'm leaving her here...
3631570 3634232 ...with a mother who hasn't the decency<br />to consider her own reputation.
3634306 3635705 You're a fine one to talk.
3636308 3637707 You think I'll let that child out<br />of this house...
3637776 3641405 ...when you'll probably have her around<br />with people like that Belle?
3641513 3643879 If you were a man<br />I'd break your neck for that.
3644282 3646443 As it is, I'll thank you<br />to shut your stupid mouth.
3646518 3649385 As for you, giving yourself pious airs<br />about your motherhood...
3649454 3651718 Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.
3651823 3654792 Have her things packed and ready<br />for me in an hour, or I warn you...
3654860 3658694 I've always thought a good lashing with a<br />buggy whip would benefit you immensely.
3664169 3665431 Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
3666471 3667495 Hello, Uncle Rhett.
3667572 3669039 Hello, hello, Beau.
3669107 3670438 Daddy, Daddy!
3670842 3674175 Where have you been?<br />I've been waiting for you all morning.
3674379 3677906 Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin<br />to wrap my little Bonnie in.
3678083 3679983 Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
3683422 3686516 I'm going to take you<br />on a long trip to fairyland!
3687559 3688856 Where? Where?
3689261 3692856 I'm going to show you the Tower<br />of London, where the little princes were...
3693165 3694496 ...and London Bridge.
3695167 3696600 London Bridge!
3696701 3698498 Will it be falling down?
3700005 3702269 Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
3704810 3706937 Daddy, dark!
3708313 3709803 Dark!
3709981 3711005 Daddy! Dark!
3713051 3715781 It's all right.<br />Who put out that light? Nurse!
3715854 3717287 Daddy, dark!
3718590 3719682 Daddy, dark!
3719758 3721419 There. Yes, yes.
3721993 3723824 What's the matter with my Bonnie?
3723962 3725259 A bear.
3725697 3727961 Oh, a bear? A big bear?
3728433 3731334 Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.
3731436 3734735 Well, I'll stay here and shoot him<br />if he comes back.
3749955 3751582 Good evening, Mr. Butler.
3754793 3757523 Haven't I told you never to leave her alone<br />in the dark?
3757596 3761555 If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often<br />afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
3761633 3763328 If you just let her scream<br />for a night or two.
3763401 3767394 Let her scream! Either you're a fool or<br />the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!
3767472 3770066 Of course, sir, if you want her<br />to grow up nervous and cowardly.
3770142 3771131 Cowardly!
3771343 3774710 There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.<br />You're discharged!
3775614 3776774 As you say, sir.
3793798 3795288 Where is Mother?
3801840 3803967 Aren't you happy here in London with me?
3804643 3807134 I want to go home.
3819324 3820689 Miss Bonnie!
3820992 3822857 And Captain Butler!
3823195 3825026 - Miss Scarlett!<br />- Hello, Mammy.
3825297 3826525 Honey, child!
3827933 3830731 Miss Scarlett! They's back!<br />They's back, Miss Scarlett!
3830902 3831960 Bonnie!
3833038 3834938 Bonnie! Bonnie, baby!
3835273 3836570 Darling, baby!
3836641 3838040 Are you glad to be home?
3838109 3839474 Daddy gave me a kitten.
3839744 3843009 - What a little, lovely kitten!<br />- London's a horrid place.
3843548 3845812 - Oh, my darling.<br />- Where's my pony?
3846017 3849214 - I want to go out and see my pony.<br />- You go out and see your pony.
3858697 3859857 Where's my pony?
3861366 3863095 I wanna go out and see my pony.
3863835 3865564 You run along with Mammy.
3865637 3867127 - Come on, honey child.<br />- Go with Mammy.
3867205 3869196 Mammy sure has missed you, honey.
3871376 3872809 Mrs. Butler, I believe.
3873845 3875335 Mammy said you'd come back.
3876815 3878305 But only to bring Bonnie.
3878383 3881784 Apparently any mother, even a bad one,<br />is better for a child than none.
3882587 3884350 You mean you're going away again?
3884756 3886314 What perception, Mrs. Butler.
3886691 3887783 Right away.
3887926 3889951 In fact, I left my bags at the station.
3892097 3894861 You're looking pale.<br />Is there a shortage of rouge?
3895367 3897858 Or can this wanness mean<br />you've been missing me?
3898770 3900328 If I'm pale, it's your fault.
3900405 3902805 Not because I've been missing you,<br />but because...
3907145 3908669 Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
3909881 3912145 It's because I'm going to have a baby.
3918189 3919213 Indeed?
3919691 3921454 And who's the happy father?
3922260 3923488 You know it's yours.
3923828 3925625 I don't want it any more than you do.
3925697 3927858 No woman would want the child<br />of a cad like you.
3927932 3930628 I wish it were anybody's child but yours.
3932604 3934936 Well, cheer up.<br />Maybe you'll have an accident.
3949554 3950680 Is she better?
3955293 3956692 Has she asked for me?
3956761 3958854 Don't you understand? She's delirious.
3960398 3962195 Rhett!
3963468 3965095 I want Rhett!
3969374 3972673 What's the matter, honey?<br />Did you call somebody, child?
3972844 3974277 It's no use.
3975547 3976878 It's no use.
3998937 4000063 Dr. Meade's left.
4001539 4002733 Scarlett's dead!
4002941 4004670 Oh, no, she's much better.
4005243 4006301 Really she is.
4023294 4025922 There, there, Captain Butler.<br />You're beside yourself.
4026464 4028694 She'll very soon be well again,<br />I promise you.
4028767 4031736 No, you don't understand.<br />She never wanted this baby.
4031936 4034370 Not want a baby?<br />Why, every woman wants a baby!
4034506 4037373 Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.<br />Not my children.
4037776 4039903 She told me she didn't want<br />any more children...
4039978 4042037 ...and I wanted to hurt her<br />because she'd hurt me.
4042113 4043410 I wanted to and I did.
4043481 4046609 Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.<br />It's not fit.
4046684 4049517 I didn't know about this baby<br />until the other day when she fell.
4049587 4052579 If I'd known, I'd have come straight home<br />whether she wanted me or not!
4052657 4054249 Well, of course you would.
4054459 4057758 And then when she told me,<br />there on the steps, what did I do?
4058329 4061127 What did I say? I laughed and I said...
4061199 4063667 But you didn't mean it.<br />I know you didn't mean it.
4064636 4067070 Oh, but I did mean it.<br />I was crazy with jealousy.
4067405 4071000 She's never cared for me. I thought I could<br />make her care, but I couldn't.
4072977 4074205 You're so wrong.
4074612 4077945 Scarlett loves you a great deal,<br />much more than she knows.
4079551 4081519 If that were only true I could wait forever.
4081586 4083781 If she'd only forgive me,<br />forget this ever happened.
4083888 4084877 She will.
4085290 4086882 You must be patient.
4089294 4090693 Oh, no, it's not possible.
4091062 4094088 You don't understand.<br />If you only knew who she really loved...
4095200 4096792 ...you wouldn't believe it.
4100071 4102505 Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
4102740 4105231 No, Captain Butler, I wouldn't believe it.
4107312 4111681 There, there. Scarlett's going to get well<br />and there can be other babies.
4111983 4115714 Oh no, no, she couldn't even if she<br />wanted to, after what she's been through.
4115787 4117755 But of course she could.
4118289 4119688 I'm going to.
4122627 4125858 No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.<br />It's too dangerous.
4126331 4128925 Children are life renewing itself,<br />Captain Butler...
4129467 4132959 ...and when life does that<br />danger seems very unimportant.
4136074 4138804 I've never before known anyone<br />who was really brave.
4139944 4142435 I pray God things go well with you,<br />Miss Melly.
4143047 4146539 And I want to thank you for all<br />you've done for me and for Scarlett.
4148019 4149680 From my heart, I thank you.
4156761 4159423 Miss Scarlett's feelin' a heap better today,<br />Mr. Rhett.
4160131 4161291 Thank you, Mammy.
4168806 4170797 I've come to ask your forgiveness...
4171142 4174043 ...in the hope that we can give<br />our life together another chance.
4174112 4175340 Our life together?
4175780 4177873 When did we ever have a life together?
4179217 4180411 Yes, you're right.
4181352 4184810 But I'm sure if we could only try again,<br />we could be happy.
4185523 4187787 Well, what is there to make us happy now?
4188726 4190887 Well, there's Bonnie and...
4191930 4193557 ...and I love you, Scarlett.
4194232 4195756 When did you discover that?
4196067 4199434 I've always loved you, but you've never<br />given me a chance to show it.
4201139 4203573 Well, and just what do you want me to do?
4205410 4207571 To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.
4208413 4209573 We'll go away.
4209647 4211740 We'll take Bonnie and we'll have<br />another honeymoon.
4211816 4214683 Give up the mill? But why?<br />It's making more money than ever.
4214752 4216686 Yes, I know, but we don't need it.
4216754 4219245 Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.
4219857 4221586 Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.
4221659 4224389 Always Melanie!<br />If you'd only think a little more about me...
4224462 4225793 I am thinking of you...
4226965 4228762 ...and I'm thinking that...
4228967 4232198 ...well, maybe it's the mill<br />that's taken you away from me...
4232637 4233968 ...and from Bonnie.
4234038 4236802 I know what you're thinking.<br />Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.
4236874 4238535 You're the one taking her away from me.
4238610 4239770 But she loves you.
4239844 4242278 You've done everything possible<br />to make her love you and not me.
4242347 4243609 Why, she's so spoiled now that...
4243681 4245012 Mommy! Daddy!
4245416 4246405 Watch me!
4246985 4248009 We're watching, darling.
4248820 4250583 You're mighty pretty, precious.
4250855 4252117 So are you.
4252523 4255151 I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.
4255893 4258589 I don't think you ought to do<br />much jumping yet, Bonnie.
4258663 4260995 Remember, you've just learned<br />to ride sidesaddle.
4261065 4262396 I will so jump!
4262500 4264991 I can jump better than ever<br />'cause I've grown...
4265470 4267062 ...and I've moved the bar higher.
4267138 4268503 Don't let her do it, Rhett.
4269007 4273103 No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,<br />don't cry and blame me.
4274078 4275568 Rhett, stop her!
4277548 4278674 Bonnie!
4279484 4280473 Bonnie!
4281853 4282979 Just like Pa.
4286824 4287950 Just like Pa!
4289560 4290652 Bonnie!
4299237 4300204 Bonnie!
4301005 4301972 Bonnie!
4318489 4321458 Lordsy, Miss Melly.<br />I sure is glad you has come.
4324095 4326996 This house won't seem<br />the same without Bonnie.
4327065 4328726 How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
4329000 4331833 Miss Melly, this here done<br />broke her heart...
4332570 4335164 ...but I didn't fetch you here<br />on Miss Scarlett's account.
4335239 4339437 What that child got to stand,<br />the good Lord give her strength to stand.
4340912 4342937 It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
4346751 4349242 He done lost his mind<br />these last couple of days.
4349353 4350786 No, Mammy, no.
4351255 4355191 I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,<br />set such store on any child.
4355993 4358086 When Dr. Meade says her neck broke...
4358463 4362160 ...Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there<br />and shoot that poor pony...
4363134 4366069 ...and for a minute I think<br />he going to shoot hisself.
4366237 4368000 Oh, poor Captain Butler.
4368072 4372805 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him<br />a murderer for teachin' that child to jump.
4373311 4375677 She say, "You give me my baby<br />what you kill."
4376147 4379878 And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't<br />never cared nothin' about Miss Bonnie.
4380418 4384445 It like to turn my blood cold,<br />the things they say to one another.
4384956 4387015 Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
4390228 4391991 And then that night...
4393030 4396431 ...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br />in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...
4397635 4399193 ...and he wouldn't even open the door...
4399270 4401431 ...when Miss Scarlett beat on it<br />and hollered to him.
4401506 4403770 And that's the way it's been<br />for two whole days.
4403875 4405069 Oh, Mammy.
4406377 4409505 And then this evenin',<br />Miss Scarlett, she shout through the door...
4409814 4412009 ...and she say the funeral set<br />for tomorrow mornin'...
4412083 4414881 ...and he says "You try that<br />and I kills you tomorrow.
4415186 4417780 "Do you think I's goin'<br />to put my child away in the...
4418222 4420053 "...in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
4420558 4423391 Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.
4423461 4426988 Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.<br />He ain't goin' to let us bury that child.
4427064 4428793 You gotta help us, Miss Melly.
4429233 4430791 Oh, but I can't intrude.
4430935 4432960 If you can't help us, who can?
4433271 4435796 Mr. Rhett always set great store<br />by your opinion.
4438342 4439536 Please, Miss Melly.
4441679 4443579 I'll do what I can, Mammy.
4450254 4452415 <i>Get away from that door,<br />and leave us alone.</i>
4452757 4454520 It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.
4454859 4456451 Please let me in.
4456527 4458119 I've come to see Bonnie.
4479483 4480507 Oh, Lord...
4481285 4483845 ...please help Mr. Rhett<br />in this hour of his grief.
4496267 4499327 I want you to go and make<br />a good deal of strong coffee...
4499570 4503165 ...and bring it up to Captain Butler.<br />I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
4503641 4504539 But...
4505042 4508239 Captain Butler is quite willing<br />for the funeral to take place...
4508412 4509606 ...tomorrow morning.
4509680 4514413 Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights<br />on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.
4515720 4517347 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
4518189 4519053 Miss Melly!
4519156 4520817 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
4522560 4524528 Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...
4525229 4526355 ...and try...
4526564 4528225 ...try to get me home.
4529934 4531492 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
4539343 4541743 Where is my mother goin' away to?
4541913 4544814 And why can't I go along, please?
4545349 4548682 We can't always go along, Beau,<br />much as we may want to.
4550388 4552185 You're going back to bed now.
4553224 4556421 Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!
4557161 4558560 She hasn't your strength.
4558629 4561928 She's never had any strength.<br />She's never had anything but heart.
4562433 4563695 You knew that, too.
4563935 4566768 Why do I have to go back to bed?<br />It's morning.
4567471 4569496 It isn't really morning yet.
4575746 4577407 You may come in now, Scarlett.
4577581 4578912 Dr. Meade, please let me see her!
4578983 4582612 I've been waiting here two whole days<br />and I've got to tell her...
4583087 4584714 ...that I was wrong about something.
4584789 4587451 She knows you were wrong.<br />She wants to see Scarlett.
4591395 4593329 Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
4593397 4595729 I won't have you easing your conscience<br />telling her things...
4595800 4598166 ...that make no difference now.<br />You understand?
4613351 4614443 It's me, Melly.
4616287 4617413 Promise me?
4618489 4619478 Anything.
4620758 4622521 Look after my little son.
4623928 4626192 I gave him to you once before.
4627298 4628765 Remember?
4629633 4631032 The day he was born.
4631569 4634868 Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<br />I know you'll get well.
4635706 4636695 Promise me...
4637608 4638666 ...college...
4638776 4642974 Yes, yes, and Europe, and a pony,<br />whatever he wants. But...
4644148 4645376 ...Melly, do try...
4645783 4646750 Ashley...
4648819 4649979 Ashley and you.
4652623 4655387 What about Ashley, Melly?
4656894 4659089 Look after him for me.
4659864 4661058 Just as you...
4662533 4664091 ...looked after me for him.
4668072 4669164 I will, Melly.
4670775 4673107 Look after him...
4673177 4676078 ...but never let him know.
4686157 4687215 Good night.
4689126 4690093 Promise?
4691796 4693024 What else, Melly?
4694265 4696028 Captain Butler...
4697435 4698902 ...be kind to him.
4699603 4700627 Rhett?
4701439 4703066 He loves you so.
4707211 4708337 Yes, Melly.
4711549 4712675 Goodbye.
4714185 4715209 Goodbye.
4731435 4732959 You ladies may come in now.
4738976 4740307 Ashley.
4741178 4743772 I don't know where the mate to this is.
4744748 4746375 She must have put it away.
4747518 4748917 Oh, stop it.
4749487 4750579 Hold me.
4750988 4752580 I'm so frightened.
4754425 4755892 I'm so frightened.
4760998 4764525 Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?<br />I can't live without her, I can't.
4766170 4767637 Everything I ever had is...
4768139 4769629 ...is going with her.
4770841 4772103 Oh, Ashley.
4773611 4775545 You really love her, don't you?
4776347 4781046 She's the only dream I ever had<br />that didn't die in the face of reality.
4781952 4784921 Dreams! Always dreams with you,<br />never common sense.
4785189 4787680 Oh, Scarlett!<br />If you knew what I've gone through!
4789326 4793092 Ashley, you should have told me years ago<br />that you loved her and not me...
4793497 4796432 ...and not left me dangling<br />with your talk of honor.
4796534 4799731 But you had to wait till now,<br />now when Melly's dying...
4800671 4803606 ...to show me that I could never mean<br />any more to you than...
4804108 4806235 ...than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
4808612 4810443 And I've loved something that...
4811315 4813215 ...that doesn't really exist.
4815886 4817114 Somehow...
4818455 4819820 ...I don't care.
4821358 4823053 Somehow it doesn't matter.
4825196 4826823 It doesn't matter one bit.
4831936 4833460 Ashley, forgive me.
4834171 4837072 Don't cry.<br />She mustn't see you've been crying.
4837608 4838734 Ashley!
4842279 4843576 <i>Melly!</i>
4845449 4846780 <i>Melly!</i>
4851222 4853213 Rhett, Rhett!
4856660 4857991 Rhett, where are you?
4862533 4863966 Rhett, wait for me.
4869039 4870506 Rhett, wait for me!
4897835 4898995 Rhett.
4902172 4903264 Come in.
4911282 4912340 Rhett...
4913017 4914575 Melanie, she's...
4918322 4919482 Well, God rest her.
4920257 4923090 She was the only completely kind person<br />I ever knew.
4924128 4925459 A great lady.
4925896 4927090 A very great lady.
4929933 4933334 So she's dead.<br />That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
4934305 4938036 Oh, how can you say such a thing?<br />You know how I loved her, really!
4939376 4940866 No, I don't know that I do.
4941412 4944643 But at least it's to your credit<br />that you could appreciate her at the end.
4944715 4948014 Of course I appreciated her.<br />She thought of everybody except herself.
4949286 4951117 Why her last words were about you.
4952323 4953483 What did she say?
4953791 4954951 She said:
4955359 4957884 "Be kind to Captain Butler.<br />He loves you so."
4964101 4965261 Did she say anything else?
4965336 4966826 She said...
4967404 4969770 ...she asked me to look after Ashley, too.
4972176 4975270 It's convenient to have<br />the first wife's permission, isn't it?
4977648 4978808 What do you mean?
4981719 4982879 What are you doing?
4983420 4984944 I'm leaving you, my dear.
4985322 4988951 All you need now is a divorce,<br />and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
4992262 4993820 Oh, no!
4994565 4996795 No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!
4997034 5000162 I don't want a divorce.<br />Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...
5000270 5002830 ...when I knew I loved you,<br />I ran home to tell you.
5002906 5004806 Oh, darling, darling...
5004975 5006567 Please don't go on with this.
5006643 5010272 Leave us some dignity to remember<br />out of our marriage. Spare us this last.
5010347 5011473 This last?
5011849 5013407 Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.
5013617 5017485 I must have loved you for years, only I was<br />such a stupid fool I didn't know it.
5017554 5019886 Please believe me. You must care.
5020424 5021686 Melly said you did.
5022326 5024851 I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?
5025996 5027759 I never really loved Ashley.
5028799 5032030 You certainly gave a good imitation of it,<br />up till this morning.
5033337 5035567 No, Scarlett. I tried everything.
5036073 5038974 If you'd only met me half way,<br />even when I came back from London.
5039042 5042705 I was so glad to see you.<br />I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
5042813 5045577 And then, when you were sick<br />and it was all my fault...
5046116 5048949 ...I hoped against hope<br />that you'd call for me, but you didn't.
5049019 5053319 I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,<br />but I didn't think you wanted me.
5054691 5058718 It seems we've been at cross purposes,<br />doesn't it? But it's no use now.
5059863 5062991 As long as there was Bonnie,<br />there was a chance we might be happy.
5063567 5065296 I liked to think that Bonnie was you.
5065369 5068896 A little girl again, before the war,<br />and poverty had done things to you.
5069807 5074335 She was so like you, and I could pet her,<br />and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.
5076447 5078574 But when she went, she took everything.
5078882 5079906 Oh, Rhett!
5080517 5082348 Rhett, please don't say that.
5082419 5085115 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.
5087357 5089052 My darling, you're such a child.
5089927 5093590 You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"<br />all the past can be corrected.
5096633 5098567 Here, take my handkerchief.
5099203 5102764 Never, at any crisis of your life,<br />have I known you to have a handkerchief.
5108579 5110410 Rhett, where are you going?
5110547 5112606 I'm going to Charleston.<br />Back where I belong.
5112683 5114651 Please. Please take me with you.
5115686 5118211 No. I'm through with everything here.
5119022 5120546 I want peace.
5120757 5124693 I want to see if somewhere there isn't<br />something left in life of charm and grace.
5125796 5129288 - Do you know what I'm talking about?<br />- No. I only know that I love you.
5130234 5131826 That's your misfortune.
5132069 5133093 Oh, Rhett.
5138342 5139331 Rhett!
5145782 5146874 Rhett!
5147017 5149986 If you go, where shall I go?<br />What shall I do?
5151021 5153251 Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
5167271 5169705 Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!
5170607 5173201 There must be some way<br />to bring him back.
5175879 5179076 I can't think about it now.<br />I'll go crazy if I do!
5180918 5182852 I'll think about it tomorrow.
5197334 5199393 But I must think about it.
5200037 5201800 I must think about it.
5203407 5204874 What is there to do?
5206310 5208141 What is there that matters?
5211315 5213510 <i>Do you mean to tell me,<br />Katie Scarlett O'Hara...</i>
5213584 5217680 <i>...that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?<br />Why, land's the only thing that matters.</i>
5218055 5220148 <i>It's the only thing that lasts.</i>
5220390 5224053 <i>Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.</i>
5224261 5227628 <i>It's this from which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.</i>
5227965 5231662 <i>Why, land's the only thing that matters.<br />It's the only thing that lasts.</i>
5231835 5235066 <i>Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.</i>
5235138 5238039 <i>This from which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.</i>
5238108 5239769 <i>Why, land's the only thing that matters.</i>
5239843 5241208 <i>Something you love better than me.</i>
5241278 5242506 <i>The red earth of Tara.</i>
5242579 5244206 <i>- Tara!<br />- Tara!</i>
5247618 5248676 Tara!
5250120 5251144 Home!
5252489 5253513 I'll go home!
5255025 5257653 And I'll think of some way to get him back.
5258295 5259660 After all...
5260230 5262425 ...tomorrow is another day.
