2022 3421 What's your hurry, sister?
3490 4889 What's come over this here town?
4958 8860 Yankees have come over it!<br />Same as they've come over all of us.
10664 12564 Out of our way, trash!
12766 13960 Get out of the way here.
14034 15592 Get away! Go on!
23710 25109 Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!
25178 27612 - Why, Frank Kennedy!<br />- And Mammy!
27681 29444 It sure is good to see home folks.
29516 31040 I didn't know you were in Atlanta.
31118 32551 I didn't know you were.
32619 35087 Didn't Miss Suellen tell you<br />about my store?
35155 38056 Did she? I don't remember.<br />Have you a store?
38225 39283 This?
39359 41623 Won't you come in and look around a bit?
50037 52631 I don't suppose it looks like much<br />to a lady, but...
52706 54571 I can't help being proud of it.
55242 56539 You're not making money?
56610 59807 Well, I can't complain.<br />In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
60313 62873 Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
62949 66077 It won't be long now<br />before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
66153 67711 Are you doing as well as all that?
67788 69585 Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.
69656 71487 I'm no millionaire yet...
71558 73924 but I've cleared $1,000 already.
74227 75319 And lumber, too.
75395 76487 Well...
77197 78494 that's only a sideline.
78565 80032 A sideline, Frank?
80200 84136 With all the good Georgia pine around<br />Atlanta and all this building going on?
84204 87173 Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...
87708 89835 and I've got to be thinking<br />about buying a home.
89910 91434 What do you want a home for?
91511 94139 For Miss Suellen and me<br />to set up housekeeping.
94214 97547 Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her<br />to Atlanta, wouldn't you?
98418 101353 There wouldn't be much help<br />in that for Tara.
101755 104690 I don't rightly know what you mean,<br />Miss Scarlett.
104758 106020 I don't mean a thing.
106093 109654 Frank, how'd you like to drive me out<br />to my Aunt Pitty's?
110230 112562 Nothing would give me<br />more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.
112632 114327 You'd better stay to supper, too.
114401 117962 I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable<br />and I'd like a good long visit with you.
118038 120666 Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,<br />Miss Scarlett.
121742 123972 And will you tell me all the news...
124044 126239 all the news of Miss Suellen?
128648 130479 What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?
130550 132074 Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
132152 133517 Oh, no, no.
133854 135822 I thought surely she had written you.
135889 137550 I guess she was ashamed to write you.
137624 139216 She should be ashamed.
139292 141920 Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.
141995 145692 You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
146166 149966 Well, she's going to marry<br />one of the county boys next month.
150737 154366 She just got tired of waiting<br />and was afraid she'd be an old maid...
154441 157171 Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
157844 160540 Oh, it's cold. I left my muff at home.
160781 163648 Would you mind<br />if I put my hand in your pocket?
180033 183093 But, Melanie, you don't realize<br />what she's done.
183170 185570 She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.
185639 187766 He's my beau,<br />and she's gone and married him.
187841 190071 She did it to save Tara,<br />you must understand that.
190143 191405 I hate Tara!
191478 195539 And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing<br />I hate worse than Tara.
199352 201013 It's all my fault.
201922 205221 I should have committed highway robbery<br />to get that tax money for you.
205292 207658 I couldn't let you<br />do anything like that, and...
207928 209418 Well, anyway, it's done now.
209496 211259 Yes, it's done now.
211765 213858 You wouldn't let me<br />do anything dishonorable...
213934 217461 but you'd sell yourself in marriage<br />to a man you didn't love.
217537 221735 Well, at least you won't have to worry<br />about my helplessness anymore.
222075 223565 What do you mean?
223643 225543 I'm going to New York.
226546 228673 I've arranged to get a position<br />in a bank there.
228748 230613 But you can't do that.
232185 235382 I counted on you to help me start<br />a lumber business, Ashley...
235455 237320 and, well, I counted on you.
237390 238652 I wouldn't be any good to you.
238725 240818 I don't know anything<br />about the lumber business.
240894 243385 You know as much as you do<br />about banking.
243463 246364 And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.
246433 248833 That's generous of you, Scarlett.
249402 251063 But it isn't that.
251137 254265 If I go to Atlanta<br />and take help from you again...
254341 256832 I'd bury forever any hope<br />of standing alone.
256910 258400 Oh, is that all?
258478 262539 Well, you could gradually buy the business<br />and then it would be your own, and...
263884 265181 No, Scarlett.
268788 269982 Ashley...
277831 279059 Ashley.
286506 287871 Scarlett!
289409 290774 Scarlett, what is it?
290844 293039 Ashley's so mean and hateful.
293246 295009 What have you done?
297217 298946 She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
299019 303217 To help me start my lumber business, and<br />he won't lift a finger to help me, and he...
303290 305224 Why, how unchivalrous of you.
305292 307283 Why, think, Ashley, think.
307494 310691 If it hadn't been for Scarlett,<br />I'd have died in Atlanta.
310764 313562 And maybe we wouldn't have had<br />little Beau...
313633 317069 and when I think of her picking cotton<br />and plowing just to keep food...
317137 318866 in our mouths, I could just...
318939 320463 Oh, my darling.
325045 326774 All right, Melanie.
326913 328642 I'll go to Atlanta.
329983 331917 I can't fight you both.
351171 354197 Well, here's your new mill hands,<br />Mrs. Kennedy.
354274 357141 The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
357644 359805 They look pretty thin and weak to me,<br />Gallagher.
359879 361039 Halt!
363350 365011 They're the best you can lease, ma'am.
365085 367918 And if you'll just give Johnny Gallagher<br />a free hand...
367988 370320 you'll get what you want out of them.
370390 372358 All right, you're the foreman.
372425 376156 All I ask is, you keep the mill running<br />and deliver my lumber when I want it.
376229 377787 Johnny Gallagher's your man, miss.
377864 379161 But remember...
379232 381700 no questions and no interference.
381768 384464 That's a bargain.<br />Start them in the morning, Gallagher.
384537 386869 Come on, get a move on!<br />Come on, move on there!
386940 389465 But, Scarlett, this isn't right<br />and you know it.
389542 392067 It's bad enough for a woman<br />to be in business, but...
392145 393442 What are you complaining about?
393513 395811 You wouldn't have owned a mill<br />had I not taken over.
395882 398476 I didn't want the mill,<br />and we couldn't have bought it...
398551 401714 if you hadn't pressed all of our friends<br />for the money they owed me.
401788 402914 Isn't that right, Ashley?
402989 405082 What, are you running<br />a charitable institution?
405158 407786 Go back to the store,<br />then go home and take your medicine.
407861 409055 You're not looking very well.
409129 411188 But, sugar, shouldn't you come home<br />with me?
411264 414631 Great balls of fire. Don't bother me<br />anymore, and don't call me sugar!
414701 416532 All right, all right.
417070 418560 Good night, Ashley.
420640 423438 She can get mad quicker<br />than any woman I ever saw.
424978 427105 Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...
427180 430445 I do wish you'd let me hire free darkies<br />instead of using convicts.
430517 431950 I believe we could do better.
432018 435181 Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,<br />and convicts are dirt-cheap.
435255 436916 If we just give Gallagher a free hand...
436990 440357 A free hand! You know what that means.<br />He'll starve them and whip them.
440427 442395 Some of them are sick, underfed...
442462 444054 Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.
444130 447156 Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken<br />three times a day and...
447233 449394 tucking them to sleep<br />with eiderdown quilts.
449469 453200 I will not make money out<br />of the enforced labor and misery of others.
453273 455298 You weren't so particular<br />about owning slaves.
455375 457809 That was different.<br />We didn't treat them that way.
457877 460209 Besides, I'd have freed them all<br />when father died...
460280 462510 if the war hadn't already freed them.
462582 463879 Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
464217 466515 But have you forgotten<br />what it's like without money?
466586 469646 I found out that money is<br />the most important thing in the world...
469722 471883 and I don't intend ever to be<br />without it again.
471958 474950 I'll make enough so the Yankees<br />can never take Tara away from me.
475028 476620 I'll make it the only way I know how.
476696 479187 But we're not the only Southerners<br />who have suffered.
479265 483031 Look at all our friends. They're keeping<br />their honor and their kindness, too.
483103 486766 And they're starving. I've got no use<br />for fools who won't help themselves.
486840 489274 I know what they're saying about me,<br />and I don't care.
489342 491367 I'll make friends<br />with Yankee carpetbaggers.
491444 494379 I'll beat them at their own game,<br />and you'll beat them with me.
496783 499775 That's it. Move it a little over to that side.
500153 501711 Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
501788 502777 Good afternoon.
502856 504619 Business is certainly growing, ain't it?
504691 505817 It certainly is.
507227 510196 But you're doing business<br />with the same people who robbed us...
510263 512823 and tortured us and left us to starve.
512899 514059 All that's past, Melly.
514134 517626 And I intend to make the best of things,<br />even if they are Yankee things.
520306 523707 And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,<br />that Dr. Meade actually saw her...
523776 526142 peddling lumber to those Yankees herself.
526212 527236 And that isn't all...
527313 530180 I think it's shocking what she's doing<br />to my brother Ashley.
530250 532775 She's even taken<br />to driving her own buggy.
540593 542288 My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
542362 544091 My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.
544430 546421 I don't see how you have<br />the gall to face me.
546499 548490 When I think you could have had<br />my millions...
548568 550092 if you'd just waited a little while.
550170 552138 Oh, how fickle is woman!
552305 554705 What is it you want?<br />I have important things to do.
554774 558972 Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point<br />which has bothered me for some time?
559045 560672 Well, what is it? Be quick.
560747 564581 Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink<br />from marrying men you don't love?
565118 568645 How did you ever get out of jail?<br />Why didn't they hang you?
568721 570416 Oh, that! Not much trouble.
570490 572355 There's nothing much<br />that money won't buy.
572425 575861 I observe it's even bought you<br />the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
575929 577988 So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
578064 580055 Do you know,<br />I believe you're jealous of him.
580133 582761 You still think<br />you're the belle of the county, don't you?
582835 585167 That you're the cutest little trick<br />in shoe leather.
585238 587365 Every man you meet<br />is dying of love for you.
587440 588771 Let me by!
589175 592269 Don't be angry, Scarlett.<br />Tell me, where are you going?
592345 594210 To the mill, if it's any of your business.
594280 595542 Through shantytown, alone?
595615 599346 Haven't you been told it's dangerous<br />to drive alone through all that riffraff?
599419 600852 Don't worry about me.
600920 604185 I can shoot straight<br />if I don't have to shoot too far.
611297 612730 What a woman!
647700 649258 Could you give me a quarter?
649335 650700 Let go of my horse!
653006 654633 Hold this horse!
665184 666242 Help!
666786 668185 Help!
669789 670881 Help!
705124 706421 Miss Scarlett!
725478 727969 Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!
728414 729938 Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!
730016 731040 Big Sam!
731384 733215 Miss Scarlett! Wait!
735388 736787 Sam! Sam!
737256 740248 Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br />Did they hurt you?
741160 744857 Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.<br />Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.
745798 747425 Horse, make tracks!
750837 753431 You get to Tara just as quick as you can<br />and stay there.
753506 756134 I sure will.<br />I got enough of them carpetbaggers.
756209 758370 Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br />Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
758444 760071 Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.
760146 763582 Scarlett, change your dress and go over<br />to Miss Melly's for the evening.
763649 765514 I've got to go to a political meeting.
765585 766677 A political meeting!
766753 768482 How can you go to a political meeting...
768554 770613 after what I've been through<br />this afternoon?
770690 773284 Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.
773359 777420 Nobody cares about me.<br />You all act as though it was nothing at all.
799218 802119 The men talk, talk, talk<br />about protecting our women...
802188 806750 and after what happened to me today<br />Frank has to go to a political meeting.
810163 812893 And if it won't pain you too much,<br />India Wilkes...
812965 815866 I'd be much obliged<br />if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.
815935 817493 Has my face gone green or something?
817570 818832 It won't pain me!
818905 821430 What happened this afternoon<br />was just what you deserved!
821507 823907 If there was any justice,<br />you'd have gotten worse.
823976 824965 India, hush up!
825044 826671 Let her talk. She's always hated me!
826746 828839 Ever since I took your brother<br />away from her...
828915 831110 though she's too much of a hypocrite<br />to admit it!
831184 832776 If she thought anyone'd go for her...
832852 834285 she'd walk down the street naked!
834353 835911 I do hate you!
836789 840020 You've done all you could<br />to lower the prestige of decent people.
840092 842822 Now you've endangered the lives<br />of our men, because they...
842895 844021 India!
844096 847896 I don't think we'd better say any more,<br />or one of us will be saying too much.
847967 850629 What's going on around here<br />that I don't know about?
856476 858273 Somebody's coming up the walk.
858344 860642 Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
860980 864074 Will you hand me the pistol, please,<br />Mrs. Meade?
869922 871514 Whoever it is...
872325 874122 we know nothing.
877029 878155 Where have they gone?
878264 880755 You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />It's life or death!
880833 883063 Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.
883135 885365 Quickly, please! There may still be time.
885438 886427 How did you know?
886506 888440 I was playing poker<br />with two Yankee captains.
888508 889839 They knew there'd be trouble.
889909 891274 They've sent their cavalry out.
891344 893676 Your husband and his friends<br />are walking into a trap.
893746 896510 Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!
899051 901679 At the Decatur Road.<br />The old Sullivan plantation.
901754 904052 The house is burned.<br />They're meeting in the cellar.
904123 905852 I'll do what I can.
910263 913130 What's all this about?<br />If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!
913199 914791 We thought it best not to tell you.
914867 918064 Ashley, Frank and the others<br />have gone to clean out those woods...
918137 919195 where you were attacked.
919272 921240 A great many Southern gentlemen have...
921307 922899 done this lately for our protection.
922975 926206 And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,<br />Scarlett!
926279 927541 And it will be your fault!
927613 929808 Another word,<br />and you go out of this house, India!
929882 931873 Scarlett did what she thought<br />she had to do.
931951 935318 And our men are doing<br />what they think they have to do.
935388 936582 Frank!
937223 938588 And Ashley!
940793 942658 Oh, it isn't possible!
945965 948490 There's horses, Miss Melly.<br />Here they come.
948568 950502 You're sewing, you're sewing.
955074 956871 Open the door, Mammy.
966586 968679 Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
970723 972418 Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?
972491 974118 I am Mrs. Wilkes.
974427 976861 I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,<br />if you please.
976929 978191 He's not here.
978264 979253 Are you sure?
979332 981459 Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.
981534 984002 I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
984070 986538 If you'll give me your word,<br />I won't search the house.
986606 990633 Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at<br />a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
990710 993577 He's not at the store,<br />and there's no meeting tonight!
993646 995307 No political meeting.
995381 998578 We'll wait outside<br />till he and his friends return.
999352 1002412 Sergeant, surround the house.<br />Put a man on each door and window.
1002488 1003750 Yes, sir!
1008160 1010560 Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
1010896 1013194 And I'll read aloud.
1016702 1020365 "The Personal History and Experience<br />of David Copperfield.
1022875 1024365 "Chapter one.
1024443 1025740 "I am born.
1030116 1033882 "To begin my life with the beginning<br />of my life, I record that I was born.
1034820 1037380 "Chapter Nine.<br />I have a memorable birthday.
1037456 1039481 "I pass over all that happened at school...
1039558 1042755 "until the anniversary of my birthday<br />came around in March.
1043863 1046559 "Except that Steerforth was more to be<br />admired than ever...
1046632 1047894 "I remember nothing.
1047967 1051061 "He was going away at the end<br />of the half-year, if not sooner...
1051170 1054503 "and was more spirited and independent<br />than before in my eyes...
1054940 1057374 "and therefore more engaging<br />than before; but...
1057443 1059343 "beyond this I remember nothing.
1060212 1061440 "The great...
1063816 1064942 "I remember nothing. "
1069989 1071684 Melly! They're drunk!
1072391 1074120 Leave this to me, Scarlett.
1074193 1075990 And please, say nothing.
1079432 1081332 You stupid fool!
1083135 1084261 Quiet!
1084904 1087304 Will you shut up for the love of...
1087373 1088567 Hello, Melly.
1088641 1092042 So you've got my husband<br />intoxicated again, Capt. Butler!
1092111 1093135 Well, bring him in.
1093212 1095578 I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />Your husband's under arrest.
1095648 1097878 If you arrest all the men<br />who get intoxicated...
1097950 1100544 you must have<br />a good many Yankees in jail.
1100619 1104077 Bring him in, Capt. Butler.<br />If you can walk yourself.
1105257 1106724 I want to tell you a story...
1106792 1108419 Listen, Doctor, I...
1108494 1110621 Put him there in that chair.
1113599 1116261 And now, Capt. Butler,<br />will you please leave my house...
1116335 1118929 and try to remember<br />not to come here again?
1119238 1122036 Well, now, that's fine thanks I get<br />for bringing him home...
1122108 1124975 and not leaving him on the streets<br />in this shameful condition!
1125044 1126671 Now, boys, all together!
1127113 1128637 Dr. Meade...
1129248 1131113 I'm astonished at you!
1137890 1140518 Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?
1141961 1144156 I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
1144530 1147431 Take him into the bedroom<br />and lay him out on the bed as usual.
1147500 1149092 Don't touch him, he's under arrest!
1149168 1150192 Now, Tom.
1150269 1152066 What do you want to arrest him for?
1152404 1154065 I've seen him drunker.
1154306 1156900 I've seen you drunker!<br />And you've seen me...
1156976 1160275 He can lie in the gutter for all I care!<br />I'm not a policeman.
1160346 1162439 But he led a raid tonight<br />on that shantytown...
1162515 1165313 where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble<br />this afternoon.
1165384 1168410 A lot of those shanties were burned.<br />A couple of men were killed.
1168487 1172548 It's about time you rebels learned you<br />can't take the law into your own hands.
1172625 1174593 What are you laughing at?
1175861 1178694 This isn't your night<br />to teach that lesson, Tom.
1178764 1181631 These two have been<br />with me tonight. Yes, sir.
1181901 1183528 With you, Rhett?
1184103 1185297 Where?
1189275 1192108 I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
1192178 1193805 You'd better say.
1193913 1196040 Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
1196115 1197309 Speak out, Capt. Butler!
1197383 1200875 I think I have a right to know<br />where my husband's been.
1202288 1205553 Well, ma'am, we dropped in<br />on a friend of mine...
1206826 1208487 and the Captain's.
1208594 1210425 A Mrs. Belle Watling.
1211030 1214124 We played cards, drank champagne and...
1214900 1216197 well...
1216268 1219704 Now you've done it! Did you have to<br />show me up in front of my wife?
1221307 1223275 Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.
1223342 1226675 These ladies won't be on speaking terms<br />with their husbands tomorrow.
1228113 1230138 Rhett, I had no idea, I...
1231417 1235376 Look here, will you take an oath<br />that they were with you tonight at...
1235454 1236580 at Belle's?
1236989 1239924 Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.<br />She'll tell you, Captain.
1239992 1242426 Will you give me your word<br />as a gentleman?
1242494 1243927 As a gentleman?
1243996 1245759 Why, certainly, Tom.
1247967 1249264 Well, if I...
1249335 1251462 if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
1252571 1255506 I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I...
1256642 1258735 If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.
1258811 1261405 Well, I say I'm sorry, and...
1262548 1264175 well, I am sorry.
1264250 1265945 Come on, Sergeant.
1272224 1274818 Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
1276395 1277487 Ashley.
1277563 1280088 He's all right. It's only in the shoulder.
1280165 1282531 Get him on the bed<br />where I can dress the wound.
1282601 1284034 I think I can walk.
1285070 1287129 It's not worth the effort. Which way?
1287206 1288264 In here.
1289942 1291910 - Mammy, I want some hot water.<br />- Yes, sir.
1291977 1293774 - And lint for bandages.<br />- I'll find some.
1293846 1296474 Now what can I use for a probe?<br />If I only had my bag.
1296548 1299210 Were you really there?<br />What did it look like?
1299852 1303948 Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br />plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
1304023 1306890 Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br />remember yourself.
1308894 1312557 Now, Capt. Butler,<br />tell me what happened, all that happened.
1312631 1313996 I was too late.
1314066 1315931 When I got to the old Sullivan place...
1316035 1318196 there'd already been a skirmish<br />with the Yankees.
1318270 1321364 I found Mr. Wilkes wounded<br />and Dr. Meade was with him.
1321440 1324739 I had to prove they had been somewhere,<br />anyplace but where they were.
1325811 1327472 So I took them to Belle's.
1327546 1329138 And she took them in?
1329214 1331876 She's by way of being<br />an old friend of mine.
1331951 1333942 Oh, I'm sorry. I...
1334019 1337352 I'm sorry I couldn't think up<br />a more dignified alibi.
1340292 1344251 This isn't the first time you've come<br />between me and disaster, Capt. Butler.
1344330 1347822 It isn't likely that I'd question<br />any device of yours.
1349368 1352633 And now I'll go and see<br />what Dr. Meade needs.
1358344 1359709 Oh, Ashley!
1361513 1362605 Ashley!
1364650 1368609 Have you no interest in what's become<br />of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?
1370923 1373357 Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
1373425 1374517 No.
1375127 1376788 Well, where is he?
1377196 1379596 He's lying out on Decatur Road...
1380065 1381930 shot through the head.
1382701 1384066 He's dead.
1394079 1395341 Who is it?
1395514 1396913 It's Miss Watling.
1396982 1399849 Oh, Miss Watling!<br />Won't you come in the house?
1399918 1402648 Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.
1403122 1405682 You come in and sit a minute with me.
1413198 1415666 How can I thank you enough<br />for what you did for us?
1415734 1417497 How can any of us thank you enough?
1417569 1420697 I got your note saying you was going<br />to call on me and thank me.
1420773 1423503 Why, Miss Wilkes,<br />you must have lost your mind.
1423575 1426100 I come up here as soon<br />as it was dark to tell you...
1426178 1428442 you mustn't even think of any such thing.
1428514 1429879 Why, I'm...
1430449 1431916 Why, you're...
1431984 1433781 Well, it wouldn't be fitting at all.
1433852 1437879 It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind<br />woman who saved my husband's life?
1437956 1442325 Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady<br />in this town nice to me like you was.
1443095 1445893 I mean, about the money<br />for the hospital, you know.
1445964 1447693 And I don't forget a kindness.
1447766 1451133 And I got to thinking about you<br />being left a widow with a little boy...
1451203 1452898 if Mr. Wilkes got hung...
1453505 1456838 and he's a nice little boy,<br />your boy is, Miss Wilkes.
1457142 1459667 I got a boy myself and so I...
1460279 1462474 Oh, you have? Does he live...
1462548 1465278 Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.
1466018 1467918 He ain't never been here.
1467986 1469920 He's off at school.
1470389 1473017 I ain't seen him since he was little.
1475427 1479659 Well, anyway, if it had been<br />that Miss Kennedy's husband by himself...
1479731 1483167 I wouldn't have lifted a finger,<br />no matter what Capt. Butler said.
1483235 1485169 She's a mighty cold woman.
1485237 1487398 Prancing about Atlanta by herself.
1487873 1490740 She killed her husband<br />same as if she shot him.
1490809 1493471 You mustn't say unkind things<br />about my sister-in-law.
1497116 1499346 Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.
1499418 1501511 I forgot how you liked her.
1502387 1506414 But she just ain't in the same class<br />with you and I can't help it if I think so.
1507226 1509888 Well, anyway, I got to be going.
1510529 1514295 I'm scared somebody'll recognize<br />this carriage if I stayed here any longer.
1514366 1516561 That wouldn't do you no good.
1517069 1518502 And, Miss Wilkes...
1519037 1522438 if you ever see me on the street,<br />you don't have to speak to me.
1523041 1524633 I'll understand.
1525177 1529238 I should be proud to speak to you.<br />Proud to be under obligation to you.
1530315 1532044 I hope we meet again.
1532117 1534347 Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fitting.
1536421 1539447 - Good night, Miss Wilkes.<br />- Good night, Miss Watling.
1544730 1546891 And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
1546965 1549160 She's brokenhearted about her husband.
1593545 1595809 Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.
1622040 1624531 Miss Scarlett, Capt. Butler here<br />to see you.
1624610 1626771 I told him you was prostrate with grief.
1626845 1629473 Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
1660078 1661511 She says she's coming.
1661580 1664242 I don't know why she's coming.<br />But she's a-coming.
1664349 1665839 You don't like me, Mammy.
1665917 1669148 Now don't you argue with me.<br />You don't. You really don't.
1681233 1683064 It's no good, Scarlett.
1683135 1684193 What?
1684269 1685668 The cologne.
1685804 1687965 I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
1688473 1691874 I mean you've been drinking.<br />Brandy. Quite a lot.
1692577 1695740 What if I have? Is that any of your affair?
1697716 1699479 Don't drink alone, Scarlett.
1699551 1702452 People always find out<br />and it ruins the reputation.
1708960 1710086 What is it?
1710162 1712528 This is more than losing old Frank.
1712597 1713962 Oh, Rhett...
1714032 1715397 I'm so afraid.
1715467 1718163 I don't believe it.<br />You've never been afraid in your life.
1718236 1719703 I'm afraid now.
1719971 1722599 I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
1723942 1726877 You look pretty healthy,<br />and maybe there isn't any hell.
1726945 1730142 Oh, there is. I know there is.<br />I was raised on it.
1731083 1734712 Well, far be it from me<br />to question the teachings of childhood.
1734786 1738085 Tell me what you've done<br />that hell yawns before you.
1738990 1741720 I ought never to have married Frank<br />to begin with.
1741793 1744853 He was Suellen's beau<br />and he loved her, not me.
1745163 1747893 And I made him miserable.<br />And I killed him.
1748433 1750367 Yes, I did. I killed him.
1753805 1758469 For the first time I'm finding out what it is<br />to be sorry for something I've done.
1759010 1761001 Here. Dry your eyes.
1761913 1764780 If you had it all to do over again,<br />you'd do no differently.
1764916 1767885 You're like the thief who isn't<br />the least bit sorry he stole...
1767953 1770945 but he's terribly, terribly sorry<br />he's going to jail.
1771022 1772990 I'm glad Mother's dead.
1773725 1776387 I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
1777329 1780492 I always wanted to be like her,<br />calm and kind and...
1781299 1784268 And I certainly have<br />turned out disappointing.
1785704 1789265 You know, Scarlett, I think<br />you're on the verge of a crying jag.
1797215 1800412 So I'll change the subject<br />and say what I came to say.
1800485 1802510 Say it, then, and get out!
1803388 1804377 What is it?
1804456 1807254 That I can't go on any longer without you.
1807325 1811421 You are the most ill-bred man to come<br />here at a time like this with your filthy...
1811496 1814090 I made up my mind that you were<br />the only woman for me...
1814166 1815827 the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.
1815901 1818426 Now that you've got the lumber mill<br />and Frank's money...
1818503 1820835 you won't come to me<br />as you did to the jail.
1820906 1822874 So I see I shall have to marry you.
1823542 1825407 I never heard of such bad taste.
1825477 1827672 Would you be more convinced<br />if I fell to my knees?
1827746 1829839 Turn me loose, you varmint,<br />and get out of here!
1829915 1833146 Forgive me for startling you<br />with the impetuosity of my sentiments...
1833218 1835743 my dear Scarlett.<br />I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
1835821 1838949 But it cannot have escaped your notice<br />that for some time past...
1839024 1842425 the friendship I have felt for you<br />has ripened into a deeper feeling.
1842494 1845895 A feeling more beautiful,<br />more pure, more sacred.
1846998 1849091 Dare I name it? Can it be love?
1849734 1852328 Get up off your knees.<br />I don't like your common jokes.
1852404 1854269 This is an honorable proposal<br />of marriage...
1854339 1856864 made at what I consider<br />a most opportune moment.
1857843 1860812 I can't go all my life waiting<br />to catch you between husbands.
1861446 1863607 You're coarse, and you're conceited.
1864616 1867176 And I think this conversation<br />has gone far enough.
1868119 1870587 Besides, I shall never marry again.
1871656 1874352 Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.
1874693 1876422 You? You?
1877162 1878527 I don't love you!
1879030 1881294 And I don't like being married.
1882267 1884667 Did you ever think<br />of marrying just for fun?
1884736 1888172 Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.<br />Fun for men, you mean.
1888974 1890999 Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?
1891076 1893510 You've been married to a boy<br />and an old man.
1893578 1896638 Why not try a husband of the right age,<br />with a way with women?
1897516 1902010 You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know<br />I shall always love another man.
1903355 1906984 Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?<br />Stop it! No more of that talk.
1912998 1914465 Rhett, don't, I shall faint.
1914533 1917297 I want you to faint.<br />This is what you were meant for.
1917369 1920566 None of the fools you've known<br />have kissed you like this, have they?
1920639 1923233 Your Charles, or your Frank,<br />or your stupid Ashley.
1931416 1934681 Say you're going to marry me.<br />Say "yes. " Say "yes. "
1934753 1935777 Yes.
1937923 1940585 Are you sure you meant it?<br />You don't want to take it back?
1940659 1941683 No.
1942327 1944955 Look at me and try to tell me the truth.
1945030 1947555 Did you say "yes" because of my money?
1947632 1948621 Well...
1948934 1950367 Yes. Partly.
1951570 1952662 Partly?
1953371 1958104 Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,<br />and of course I am fond of you.
1958276 1959300 Fond of me?
1959377 1962869 If I said I was madly in love with you,<br />you'd know I was lying...
1962948 1964973 but you always said<br />we had a lot in common...
1965050 1966711 Yes, you're right, my dear.
1966785 1969253 I'm not in love with you any more<br />than you are with me.
1969321 1972051 Heaven help the man<br />who ever really loves you.
1972123 1974216 What kind of a ring would you like,<br />my darling?
1974292 1977489 A diamond ring.<br />And do buy a great big one, Rhett.
1977562 1980463 You shall have the biggest<br />and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
1980532 1983262 We'll go to New Orleans<br />for the most expensive honeymoon...
1983335 1984495 my ill-gotten gains can buy.
1984569 1986230 That would be just heavenly.
1986304 1988499 And I think I'll buy your trousseau<br />for you, too.
1988573 1990700 Rhett, how wonderful, but...
1990875 1993435 you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?
1993511 1995536 Still the little hypocrite.
1997649 1999674 Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?
1999751 2002515 Don't you think you've had enough kissing<br />for one afternoon?
2002587 2003679 You're impossible.
2003755 2006155 You can go and I don't care<br />if you never come back.
2006224 2008021 But I will come back.
2022540 2024599 What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
2024709 2027234 I'm thinking about how rich we are.
2028580 2030912 Rhett, I can keep<br />the lumber business too, can't I?
2030982 2033143 Yes, of course you can, if it amuses you.
2033218 2036187 Now that you're rich<br />you can tell everyone to go to the devil...
2036254 2037846 as you've always said you wanted to.
2037922 2040390 But you were the main one<br />I wanted to go to the devil.
2058343 2062040 Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.<br />I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
2062113 2066015 Rhett, can I have one of those<br />chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?
2066084 2069417 If you don't stop being such a glutton,<br />you'll get as fat as Mammy.
2069487 2070818 Then I'll divorce you.
2071756 2074486 Wouldn't it be nice if you bought<br />something for Mammy, too?
2074559 2078222 Why should I buy her a present<br />when she called us both mules?
2078296 2079729 Mules? Why mules?
2079798 2083564 Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,<br />and get ourselves all slicked up...
2083635 2086263 like racehorses but we were just mules<br />in horse harness...
2086337 2088430 and we didn't fool anybody.
2088807 2090604 I never heard anything more true.
2090675 2092472 Mammy's a smart old soul...
2092544 2095843 and one of the few people I know<br />whose respect I'd like to have.
2096581 2098811 I won't give her a thing.<br />She doesn't deserve it.
2098883 2100646 Then I'll take her a petticoat.
2100719 2102914 My Mammy always said<br />when she went to heaven...
2102987 2106946 she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,<br />so stiff that it would stand by itself...
2107025 2110256 and so rustly, the Lord would think<br />it was made of angels' wings.
2110328 2113491 Well, she won't take it from you.<br />She'd rather die than wear it.
2113565 2116329 That may be, but I'm making the gesture<br />just the same.
2121039 2123234 Wake up! Wake up!
2125176 2127644 You were having another nightmare.
2128213 2129578 Oh, Rhett.
2129647 2131842 I was so cold and hungry...
2131916 2133577 and so tired I...
2134018 2137977 I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist<br />and I couldn't find it.
2138823 2141348 - Find what, honey?<br />- I don't know.
2141593 2144653 I always dream the same dream<br />and I never know.
2144763 2146754 It seems to be hidden in the mist.
2146831 2147923 Darling.
2149234 2153364 Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream<br />that I've found it and that I'm safe?
2154706 2158802 Dreams don't work that way, but when<br />you get used to being safe and warm...
2159277 2161507 you'll stop dreaming that dream.
2161579 2164946 And, Scarlett, I'm going to see<br />that you are safe.
2168920 2171582 Would you do something<br />for me if I asked you?
2171656 2173283 You know I would.
2174092 2176390 Will you take me away from here?
2176728 2178195 Don't you like New Orleans?
2178263 2182359 I love New Orleans,<br />but I want to go home and visit Tara.
2183201 2185226 Will you take me to Tara?
2185570 2190064 Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.<br />We'll go tomorrow.
2193478 2196276 You get your strength<br />from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.
2196347 2198406 You're part of it, and it's part of you.
2198483 2202214 Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara<br />the way it was before the war.
2202287 2205188 Would you?<br />Then go ahead and make it that way.
2205723 2209022 Spend whatever you want,<br />make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
2209627 2211117 Oh, Rhett.
2211729 2213492 Rhett, you are good to me.
2213565 2215897 And can we still have<br />our big new house in Atlanta?
2215967 2218527 Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want:
2219003 2221369 Marble terraces, stained-glass windows<br />and all.
2221439 2223339 Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?
2223408 2226809 I want everybody who's been mean to me<br />to be pea-green with envy.
2228379 2232543 I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,<br />building that new house just to show off...
2232684 2234914 and even taking our servants.
2235887 2238788 Oh, darling, you mustn't think<br />unkindly of her.
2239257 2242283 She's made it possible for us<br />to keep Tara always.
2242360 2244351 Yes, and what good is Tara?
2244429 2247990 She's had three husbands<br />and I'll be an old maid.
2251002 2252833 Great Jehoshaphat!
2253638 2255333 Great Jehoshaphat!
2255773 2257604 Lordsy, we sure is rich now!
2257675 2259006 It ain't quality.
2259544 2261739 But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?
2262213 2264943 I'm entitled to at least see<br />what my own child looks like.
2265016 2268782 You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.<br />You'll be seeing it for a long time.
2269320 2272153 I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,<br />about it's not being a boy.
2272223 2274589 Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.<br />Who wants a boy?
2274659 2277856 Boys aren't any use to anybody.<br />Don't you think I'm proof of that?
2278630 2280461 Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.
2280531 2283056 Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
2283368 2284699 She sure is.
2285603 2287230 Did you ever see a prettier one?
2287305 2291605 Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh<br />that pretty when she come, but not quite.
2291676 2293701 Have another glass, Mammy.
2297782 2299875 What's that rustling noise I hear?
2299951 2304183 Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothing but<br />my red silk petticoat you done give me.
2304255 2307349 Nothing but your petticoat?<br />I don't believe it. Let me see.
2307425 2309017 Pull up your skirt.
2309093 2311288 Mr. Rhett, you is bad.
2311729 2312957 Yeah, oh, Lord!
2318903 2322066 You sure took a long enough time<br />about wearing it.
2322140 2323767 Yes, sir, too long.
2324475 2326670 No more mule in horse's harness?
2326744 2329975 Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad<br />telling you about that.
2330048 2332983 You ain't holding that<br />against old Mammy, is you?
2333051 2335884 No, I ain't holding it against you.<br />I just wanted to know.
2335954 2338855 Have another glass, Mammy.<br />Here, take the whole bottle.
2338923 2341915 Dr. Meade says you may go in now,<br />Capt. Butler.
2345263 2347424 This sure is a happy day to me.
2347498 2350729 I done diapered three generations<br />of this family's girls...
2350802 2352861 and it sure is a happy day.
2353037 2356404 Oh, yes, Mammy.<br />The happiest days are when babies come.
2356474 2357873 I wish...
2358209 2361372 Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.<br />What do you suppose they'll name her?
2361479 2363879 Miss Scarlett done told me<br />if it was a girl...
2363982 2367213 she's going to name it Eugenie Victoria.
2367885 2369113 Yes...
2369187 2371121 she's a beautiful baby...
2371889 2374289 the most beautiful baby ever.
2375360 2376554 Yes.
2378096 2380428 Do you know that this is your birthday?
2381132 2383293 That you're a week old today?
2383935 2388770 Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes<br />of which this town has never seen.
2389807 2393334 Yes, I'm gonna send her<br />to the best schools in Charleston.
2393411 2397438 Yes. And her'll be received<br />by the best families in the South.
2398282 2400773 And when it comes time for her to marry...
2400852 2403787 well, she'll be a little princess.
2404689 2406884 You certainly are making a fool of yourself.
2406958 2408220 And why shouldn't I?
2409260 2412559 She's the first person<br />who's ever completely belonged to me.
2413564 2415259 Great balls of fire!
2415333 2417164 I had the baby, didn't I?
2417802 2419360 It's Melanie. May I come in?
2419437 2420597 Come in, Melly.
2420671 2424334 Yes, come in and look at my daughter's<br />beautiful blue eyes.
2425977 2429071 But, Capt. Butler, most babies<br />have blue eyes when they're born.
2429180 2432240 Don't try to tell him anything.<br />He knows everything about babies.
2432316 2435513 Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br />and they're going to stay blue.
2435586 2437918 As blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag.
2438489 2440980 That's it. That's what we'll call her.
2441059 2442788 Bonnie Blue Butler.
2451033 2452625 Try again, Mammy.
2460242 2461368 Twenty inches.
2461877 2464937 Twenty inches!<br />I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
2465013 2467811 You've simply got to make it<br />18.5 again, Mammy.
2467883 2469475 You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...
2469551 2472042 and you ain't never going to be<br />no 18.5 inches again.
2472121 2475113 Never. And there ain't nothing<br />to do about it.
2475691 2477852 There is something to do about it!
2477926 2481259 I'm just not going to get old and fat<br />before my time.
2481663 2484063 I just won't have any more babies!
2484533 2488264 I heard Mr. Rhett say<br />that he'll be wanting a son next year.
2488337 2491170 Go tell Capt. Butler<br />I've decided not to go out after all.
2491240 2493174 I'll have supper in my room.
2513529 2517260 I got your message. I'll have them bring<br />my supper up here, too.
2524273 2525968 No objections to that, I hope?
2526074 2527200 No.
2528477 2529637 Yes.
2531446 2534347 I mean, I don't care<br />where you have your supper.
2536585 2537609 Rhett?
2538487 2539511 Yes?
2539588 2540919 You see...
2541190 2543090 well, I've decided...
2545093 2547994 well, I hope I don't have<br />any more children.
2560209 2563110 My pet, as I told you<br />before Bonnie was born...
2564012 2567004 it's immaterial to me<br />whether you have one child or 20!
2567115 2569208 No, but you know what I...
2569351 2570943 Do you know what I mean?
2571019 2574079 I do. And do you know<br />I can divorce you for this?
2575057 2577548 You're just low enough<br />to think of something like that!
2577626 2581562 If you had any chivalry in you or would<br />be nice, like... Well, Ashley Wilkes!
2581630 2584155 Melanie can't have any more children<br />and he...
2586268 2589101 You've been to the lumber office<br />this afternoon, haven't you?
2589171 2591503 What has that got to do with it?
2592407 2595865 Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br />Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.
2595944 2598174 It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
2599481 2601472 You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
2601550 2602710 Sorry for me?
2602784 2606083 Yes, because you're throwing away<br />happiness with both hands...
2606154 2608918 and reaching out for something<br />that'll never make you happy.
2608991 2610720 I don't know what you're talking about.
2610792 2614023 If you were free and Melly were dead<br />and you had your precious...
2614096 2616997 honorable Ashley, do you think<br />you'd be happy with him?
2617866 2621324 You'd never know him,<br />never even understand his mind...
2621603 2624504 any more than you understand anything<br />except money.
2624573 2626837 Never mind about that!<br />What I want to know is...
2626909 2630777 You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.<br />It'll work no hardship on me.
2631246 2632804 Do you mean to say you don't care?
2632881 2636612 The world is full of many things<br />and many people, and I shan't be lonely.
2637185 2639119 I'll find comfort elsewhere.
2639187 2641178 Well, that's fine. But I warn you.
2641256 2644419 Just in case you change your mind,<br />I intend to lock my door.
2644493 2647951 Why bother? If I wanted to come in,<br />no lock could keep me out!
2666581 2669982 I always knew that most women<br />were cheats, hypocritical and hard.
2670052 2672486 - But this one...<br />- Rhett, it ain't no use.
2672554 2675455 - What do you mean?<br />- I mean you're poisoned with her.
2675524 2678721 I don't care what she's done to you,<br />you're still in love with her.
2678794 2680853 And don't think it pleasures me none<br />to say it.
2680929 2683830 Maybe so! But I'm through with her,<br />I tell you! I'm through.
2683899 2687562 You gotta think of the child.<br />The child's worth ten of the mother.
2693842 2697073 You're a shrewd woman, Belle,<br />and a very nice one.
2698714 2699703 Yes, Rhett?
2699781 2703342 I was just thinking of the difference<br />between you and...
2703418 2706876 You're both hardheaded businesswomen<br />and you're both successful.
2706955 2709048 But you've got a heart, Belle...
2710692 2712319 and you're honest.
2714763 2716321 Goodbye, Rhett.
2717232 2718790 Goodbye, Belle.
2734349 2736510 She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!
2736752 2738777 Look at those hands, and that seat!
2739021 2740079 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
2740155 2743488 Why do we have to wheel a baby<br />when there are servants...
2743558 2744957 Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
2745027 2746221 Good morning, Capt. Butler.
2746294 2747625 Good morning, Scarlett.
2747696 2750290 Making fools of ourselves<br />in front of these old buffaloes!
2750365 2753857 If you'd thought of your position<br />years ago, you wouldn't have to do this.
2753935 2758372 But as it is, we'll cultivate every female<br />dragon of the old guard in this town.
2758807 2760297 Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
2760375 2763674 Good morning, Capt. Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
2764446 2767677 So the millionaire speculator<br />is turning respectable!
2767816 2770080 All of our money can't buy<br />what I want for Bonnie.
2770152 2772382 Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.
2772454 2774979 But Bonnie's going to have her place<br />among decent people.
2775057 2778652 Yes, even if we both have to crawl<br />on our bellies to every fat old cat.
2779428 2781123 Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
2781430 2784092 Good morning, Capt. Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
2790305 2793433 Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had<br />a great regard for your knowledge.
2793508 2795237 I wonder if you could give me<br />some advice.
2795310 2796368 Certainly.
2796445 2798777 My Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br />I can't make her stop it.
2798847 2801281 Make her stop it.<br />It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
2801349 2802441 I know, I know.
2802517 2806146 She has such a beautiful mouth, too.<br />I tried putting soap under her nails.
2806221 2807313 Soap! Bah!
2807389 2810881 Put quinine on her thumb<br />and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
2811126 2813924 Quinine! I never would have thought of it.
2813995 2816190 I can't thank you enough,<br />Mrs. Merriwether.
2816264 2819358 You've taken a great load off my mind!<br />Good morning.
2822971 2824461 Good morning, Dolly.
2824539 2826166 Wasn't that Capt. Butler?
2826241 2829108 Good morning, Caroline.<br />I was just thinking.
2829177 2833273 There must be a great deal of good<br />in a man who could love a child so much.
2833348 2835213 But of course there is!
2835283 2839049 Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing<br />told Dr. Meade that Capt. Butler...
2839121 2841954 finally admitted he was honored<br />by the Confederate Congress...
2842023 2844048 for his services at the Battle of Franklin?
2844126 2847254 No! And did I tell you, Caroline,<br />that Capt. Butler...
2847329 2850890 made a stupendous contribution<br />to the Association for the Beautification...
2850966 2852900 of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
2852968 2854026 No.
2854703 2858469 My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,<br />is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
2858540 2861338 Why, Dolly Merriwether,<br />you know right well it was my idea...
2861409 2862933 to give a party for Bonnie Butler.
2863011 2864342 Why Caroline Meade...
2873455 2876891 Now watch Daddy put your pony over,<br />Bonnie. Now watch.
2879628 2881926 Daddy, let me! Let me!
2882097 2884691 All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!
2888136 2889398 Up we go.
2889604 2890901 Oh, there!
2891206 2893697 Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!
2893775 2897472 Grip tightly with your legs. Sit close.<br />Lean forward. Be sure you go with him.
2897546 2900310 Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.<br />Up!
2901183 2903310 That was fine! I knew you'd do it!
2903385 2906582 When you get a little older,<br />I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
2906655 2910557 You'll be the greatest horsewoman<br />in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
2911259 2913022 Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!
2913662 2914822 Mr. Rhett!
2915730 2918324 Did you see her, Mammy?<br />Wasn't she wonderful?
2918400 2922336 Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you<br />it just ain't fitting...
2922404 2925601 for a girl child to ride astraddle<br />with her dress flying up!
2925674 2928040 All right, Mammy.<br />I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
2928109 2931340 And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.<br />She'll love that.
2931413 2933711 A nice black broadcloth<br />is what little girls wear.
2933782 2935909 Now, Mammy, be reasonable.
2936418 2938613 Well, I don't think it's fitting, but...
2940655 2943317 It ain't fitting, it just ain't fitting.
2944292 2945589 It ain't fitting.
2956071 2957538 Why, Scarlett!
2957872 2959999 What are you doing downtown<br />at this time of day?
2960075 2961133 Ashley, I just...
2961209 2964770 Why aren't you helping Melly get ready<br />for my surprise birthday party?
2964846 2968441 Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed<br />to know anything about that.
2968516 2971246 Melly'd be so disappointed<br />if you weren't surprised.
2971319 2974777 I won't let on.<br />I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
2975490 2977822 As long as you're here,<br />let me show you the books...
2977892 2980690 so you can see just how bad<br />a businessman I really am.
2980762 2982923 Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.
2982998 2985796 When I'm wearing a new bonnet,<br />all the figures I ever knew...
2985867 2987596 go right slap out of my head.
2987669 2991298 The figures are well lost<br />when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.
2991373 2994342 Scarlett, you know,<br />you get prettier all the time.
2995310 2999144 You haven't changed a bit since the day<br />of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
2999681 3003048 where you sat under a tree<br />surrounded by dozens of beaux.
3004686 3007086 That girl doesn't exist anymore.
3007589 3010422 Nothing's turned out<br />as I expected, Ashley.
3010492 3011789 Nothing.
3012294 3016594 Yes, we've traveled a long road<br />since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?
3016665 3018394 Oh, the lazy days...
3018466 3020991 the warm, still country twilights...
3021970 3025201 the high, soft Negro laughter<br />from the quarters...
3025774 3029005 the golden warmth and security<br />of those days.
3031246 3033237 Don't look back, Ashley.
3033448 3035075 Don't look back.
3036751 3041450 It drags at your heart<br />till you can't do anything but look back.
3046594 3049290 I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
3049964 3053456 I never want you to be anything<br />but completely happy.
3073421 3074479 Oh, Ashley!
3076991 3078083 Who is it?
3078159 3079820 Only your husband.
3080462 3081724 Come in.
3082764 3085858 Am I actually being invited<br />into the sanctuary?
3086534 3088934 You're not ready for Melanie's party.
3089003 3090527 I've got a headache, Rhett.
3090605 3093802 You go without me<br />and make my excuses to Melanie.
3095076 3098603 What a white-livered little coward<br />you are. Get up.
3098680 3101012 You're going to that party<br />and you'll have to hurry.
3101082 3102674 - Has India dared to...<br />- Yes. India has!
3102751 3104685 Every woman and man in town<br />knows the story!
3104753 3106380 You should kill them, spreading lies.
3106454 3109287 I have a strange way of not killing people<br />who tell the truth.
3109357 3110881 There's no time to argue. Get up!
3110959 3113928 I won't go! I can't go<br />till this misunderstanding is cleared up.
3113995 3116691 Don't cheat Melly<br />out of the satisfaction of publicly...
3116765 3118062 ordering you out of her house.
3118133 3119998 There was nothing wrong.<br />India hates me so.
3120068 3121831 I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.
3121903 3125395 If you don't go, you won't be able<br />to show your face as long as you live.
3125473 3128374 That wouldn't bother me, but<br />you won't ruin Bonnie's chances.
3128443 3132209 You're going to that party,<br />if only for her sake. Now get dressed!
3145326 3149194 Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly<br />will do for this occasion.
3149264 3152461 And put on plenty of rouge.<br />I want you to look your part tonight.
3159541 3164410 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
3164846 3169647 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
3170318 3174015 <i>Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
3174756 3177190 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
3178993 3181518 - Good night, Scarlett.<br />- But Rhett, you can't...
3181596 3184565 You go into the arena alone.<br />The lions are hungry for you.
3184632 3186361 Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.
3186434 3187731 You're not afraid?
3187802 3189929 <i>Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
3190004 3194566 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
3194676 3199113 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
3214462 3216760 What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.
3216831 3218492 India wasn't able to come tonight.
3218566 3219794 Will you be an angel?
3219868 3223099 I do need you to help me<br />receive my guests.
3226174 3227607 Mrs. Meade...
3227842 3230003 here's our darling Scarlett.
3231513 3232571 Good evening.
3232680 3233942 Good evening.
3234015 3235414 Why, Scarlett!
3235850 3238717 - Good evening, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good evening, Mrs. Butler.
3239487 3242979 Ashley, aren't you going to get<br />our Scarlett a glass of punch?
3250565 3253500 Did you have a good time tonight<br />at Miss Melly's party, child?
3253568 3254592 Yes, yes.
3254669 3256534 Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word.
3256604 3259698 If Capt. Butler asks for me<br />when he comes back, I'm asleep.
3260074 3261336 Yes, ma'am.
3290505 3292302 Come in, Mrs. Butler.
3301316 3302647 Come here.
3318333 3319357 Sit down!
3322036 3325472 There's no reason why you shouldn't have<br />your nightcap even if I am here.
3325540 3327974 I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and...
3328042 3330306 You heard nothing of the kind.
3330378 3333176 You wouldn't have come down<br />if you'd thought I was here.
3333247 3335477 - You must need a drink badly.<br />- I do not!
3335550 3338348 Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
3338419 3341479 I know you drink on the quiet,<br />and I know how much you drink.
3341923 3344221 Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
3350999 3352694 You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!
3352767 3354257 I'm very drunk...
3354602 3357799 and I intend getting still drunker<br />before the evening's over...
3358606 3361336 but you're not going to bed, not yet.
3362610 3363736 Sit down.
3366948 3368882 So she stood by you, did she?
3370118 3373713 How does it feel to have the woman<br />you've wronged cloak your sins for you?
3375390 3378359 You're wondering if she knows<br />all about you and Ashley.
3378626 3381220 You're wondering if she did it<br />just to save her face.
3381629 3385497 You're thinking that she's a fool for<br />doing it even if it did save your hide.
3385566 3387727 - I will not listen.<br />- Yes, you'll listen!
3388803 3391203 Miss Melly's a fool,<br />but not the kind you think.
3391806 3395401 It's just that there's too much honor in her<br />to ever conceive of dishonor...
3395476 3397068 in anyone she loves.
3397845 3399437 And she loves you.
3399881 3402714 Though just why she does,<br />I'm sure I don't know!
3403885 3407150 If you weren't so drunk and insulting,<br />I could explain everything.
3407622 3410682 - As it is, though...<br />- If you get out of that chair once more...
3414929 3419559 Of course, the comic figure in all this<br />is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
3420601 3423570 Mr. Wilkes, who can't be<br />mentally faithful to his wife...
3423671 3426231 and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
3427909 3429672 Why doesn't he make up his mind?
3429777 3431267 Rhett, you...
3434315 3436715 Observe my hands, my dear.
3437719 3440153 I could tear you to pieces with them.
3440822 3444349 And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley<br />out of your mind forever.
3445426 3446984 But it wouldn't.
3447829 3451595 So I'll remove him<br />from your mind forever this way.
3452800 3454893 I'll put my hands so...
3455770 3457897 one on each side of your head...
3458906 3462967 and I'll smash your skull between them<br />like a walnut.
3463778 3466008 That'll block him out.
3467281 3469977 Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.
3475256 3478487 You know I've always admired<br />your spirit, my dear.
3479460 3482224 Never more than now,<br />when you're cornered.
3482930 3484295 I'm not cornered.
3484365 3487198 You'll never corner me,<br />Rhett Butler, or frighten me!
3487268 3490760 You've lived in dirt so long,<br />you can't understand anything else.
3490838 3494569 And you're jealous of something<br />you can't understand. Good night!
3497111 3498476 Jealous, am I?
3498579 3500376 Yes, I suppose I am.
3500982 3504474 Even though I know<br />you've been faithful to me all along.
3504619 3505847 How do I know?
3505987 3509150 Because I know Ashley Wilkes<br />and his honorable breed.
3509757 3511349 They're gentlemen.
3511492 3514723 And that's more than I can say<br />for you or for me.
3515163 3518690 We're not gentlemen,<br />and we have no honor, have we?
3528342 3530435 It's not that easy, Scarlett.
3534415 3536747 You turned me out<br />while you chased Ashley Wilkes...
3536818 3538615 while you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.
3538686 3540916 This is one night<br />you're not turning me out.
3569417 3571544 How are you feeling<br />this morning, Mammy?
3571619 3575487 Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.
3578459 3580984 You acting mighty happy this morning,<br />Miss Scarlett.
3581128 3582595 I am, Mammy. I am.
3589737 3594572 <i>Oh, she wept with delight<br />when he gave her a smile</i>
3595076 3599035 <i>And trembled with fear at his frown</i>
3616530 3617554 Hello.
3620401 3623996 I'd like to extend my apology<br />for my conduct of last night.
3624272 3625899 Oh, but Rhett...
3625973 3627201 I was very drunk...
3627275 3630540 and quite swept off my feet<br />by your charms.
3632980 3636541 Well, you needn't bother to apologize.<br />Nothing you ever do surprises me!
3637051 3639849 I've been thinking things over,<br />and I really believe that...
3639921 3641445 it would be better for both of us...
3641522 3644252 if we admitted we'd made a mistake<br />and got a divorce.
3644592 3646059 - A divorce?<br />- Yes.
3646127 3648823 There's no point in our holding on<br />to each other, is there?
3648896 3651296 I'll provide for you amply.<br />You've plenty of grounds.
3651365 3654334 Just give me Bonnie.<br />Say what you please. I won't contest.
3654402 3655391 Thank you very much.
3655469 3658495 But I wouldn't dream<br />of disgracing my family with a divorce.
3659240 3661731 You'd disgrace it quick enough<br />if Ashley were free.
3661809 3664801 It makes my head spin to think<br />how quickly you'd divorce me.
3665947 3667346 Wouldn't you, Scarlett?
3668783 3670011 Well, answer me.
3670084 3671108 Wouldn't you?
3671185 3673415 Will you please go now<br />and leave me alone?
3674956 3677754 Yes, I'm going.<br />That's what I came to tell you.
3678292 3682422 I'm going on a very extended trip<br />to London, and I'm leaving today.
3683030 3684691 And I'm taking Bonnie with me.
3684765 3687256 So you'll please<br />get her little duds packed right away.
3687335 3689860 You'll never take my child<br />out of this house.
3689937 3691802 She's my child, too, Scarlett.
3691906 3693464 I wouldn't leave her here...
3693541 3696738 with a mother who hasn't the decency<br />to consider her own reputation.
3696811 3698301 You're a fine one to talk.
3698379 3700279 You think I'll let her out of this house...
3700348 3703943 when you'll probably have her around<br />with people like that Belle?
3704018 3706384 If you were a man<br />I'd break your neck for that.
3706654 3708952 As it is, I'll thank you<br />to shut your stupid mouth.
3709023 3711992 As for you, giving yourself pious airs<br />about your motherhood...
3712059 3713993 Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.
3714061 3717292 Have her things packed and ready<br />for me in an hour, or I warn you...
3717365 3721267 I've always thought a good lashing with a<br />buggy whip would benefit you immensely.
3726674 3728266 Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
3728909 3730001 Hello, Uncle Rhett.
3730077 3731544 Hello, hello, Beau.
3731612 3733170 Daddy, Daddy.
3733347 3736805 Where have you been?<br />I've been waiting for you all morning.
3736884 3740411 Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin<br />to wrap my little Bonnie in.
3740588 3742886 Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
3745926 3749020 I'm going to take you<br />on a long trip to fairyland.
3750064 3751361 Where? Where?
3751766 3755361 I'm going to show you the Tower<br />of London, where the little princes were...
3755669 3757330 and London Bridge.
3757671 3759104 London Bridge!
3759206 3761003 Will it be falling down?
3762410 3764674 Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
3767314 3769441 Daddy, dark!
3770818 3772308 Dark!
3772486 3774477 Daddy! Dark!
3775556 3778286 It's all right.<br />Who put out that light? Nurse!
3778359 3779792 Daddy, dark!
3781095 3782187 Daddy, dark!
3782263 3783924 There. Yes, yes.
3784498 3786398 What's the matter with my Bonnie?
3786467 3787764 A bear.
3788202 3790466 Oh, a bear? A big bear?
3790938 3793839 Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.
3793941 3797240 Well, I'll stay here and shoot him<br />if he comes back.
3812460 3814428 Good evening, Mr. Butler.
3817298 3819892 Haven't I told you never to leave her alone<br />in the dark?
3819967 3824063 If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often<br />afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
3824138 3826003 Just let her scream for a night or two.
3826073 3829804 Let her scream! Either you're a fool or<br />the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!
3829877 3832641 Of course, if you want her<br />to grow up nervous and cowardly.
3832713 3833771 Cowardly!
3833848 3837215 There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.<br />You're discharged!
3838119 3839279 As you say, sir.
3856303 3857793 Where is Mother?
3864345 3866472 Aren't you happy here in London with me?
3867148 3869639 I want to go home.
3881829 3883194 Miss Bonnie.
3883497 3885431 And Capt. Butler.
3885699 3887724 - Miss Scarlett.<br />- Hello, Mammy.
3887801 3889029 Honey child.
3890437 3893235 Miss Scarlett! They's back.<br />They's back, Miss Scarlett.
3893407 3894601 Bonnie.
3895543 3897443 Bonnie. Bonnie, baby.
3897778 3899075 Darling baby.
3899146 3900545 Are you glad to be home?
3900614 3902172 Daddy gave me a kitten.
3902249 3905514 - What a lovely kitten.<br />- London's a horrid place.
3906053 3908317 - Oh, my darling.<br />- Where's my pony?
3908522 3911719 - I want to go out and see my pony.<br />- You go out and see your pony.
3921202 3922760 Where's my pony?
3923871 3925600 I wanna go out and see my pony.
3926340 3927967 You run along with Mammy.
3928042 3929634 - Come on, honey child.<br />- Go with Mammy.
3929710 3931701 Mammy sure has missed you, honey.
3933881 3935314 Mrs. Butler, I believe.
3936350 3937840 Mammy said you'd come back.
3939320 3940810 But only to bring Bonnie.
3940888 3944289 Apparently any mother, even a bad one,<br />is better for a child than none.
3945092 3946855 You mean you're going away again?
3947261 3948819 What perception, Mrs. Butler.
3949196 3950288 Right away.
3950431 3952763 In fact, I left my bags at the station.
3954602 3957799 You're looking pale.<br />Is there a shortage of rouge?
3957871 3960635 Or can this wanness mean<br />you've been missing me?
3961275 3962833 If I'm pale, it's your fault.
3962910 3965936 Not because I've been missing you,<br />but because...
3969650 3971584 Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
3972386 3974650 It's because I'm going to have a baby.
3980694 3981718 Indeed?
3982196 3983959 And who's the happy father?
3984765 3986255 You know it's yours.
3986333 3988130 I don't want it any more than you do.
3988202 3990363 No woman would want the child<br />of a cad like you.
3990437 3993133 I wish it were anybody's child but yours.
3995109 3997441 Well, cheer up.<br />Maybe you'll have an accident.
4012059 4013583 Is she better?
4017798 4019197 Has she asked for me?
4019266 4021359 Don't you understand? She's delirious.
4022903 4024700 Rhett.
4025973 4027600 I want Rhett.
4031879 4035280 What's the matter, honey?<br />Did you call somebody, child?
4035349 4036782 It's no use.
4038052 4039212 It's no use.
4061375 4062933 Dr. Meade's left.
4064044 4065375 Scarlett's dead!
4065446 4067175 Oh, no, she's much better.
4067748 4069079 Really, she is.
4085799 4088893 There, there, Capt. Butler.<br />You're beside yourself.
4088969 4091199 She'll very soon be well again,<br />I promise you.
4091271 4094240 No, you don't understand.<br />She never wanted this baby.
4094441 4096932 Not want a baby?<br />Why, every woman wants a baby!
4097010 4099877 Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.<br />Not my children.
4100280 4102407 She told me she didn't want<br />any more children...
4102483 4104542 and I wanted to hurt her<br />because she'd hurt me.
4104618 4105915 I wanted to and I did.
4105986 4108978 Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.<br />It's not fit.
4109056 4112025 I didn't know about this baby<br />until the other day when she fell.
4112092 4115084 If I'd known, I'd have come home<br />whether she wanted me or not!
4115162 4116891 Well, of course you would.
4116964 4120764 And then when she told me,<br />there on the steps, what did I do?
4120834 4123632 What did I say? I laughed and I said...
4123704 4126867 But you didn't mean it.<br />I know you didn't mean it.
4127007 4129840 Oh, but I did mean it.<br />I was crazy with jealousy.
4129910 4133505 She's never cared for me. I thought<br />I could make her care, but I couldn't.
4135382 4137043 You're so wrong.
4137117 4140450 Scarlett loves you a great deal,<br />much more than she knows.
4142022 4143990 If that were only true I could wait forever.
4144057 4146355 If she'd only forgive me,<br />forget this ever happened.
4146427 4147655 She will.
4147795 4149387 You must be patient.
4151799 4153494 Oh, no, it's not possible.
4153567 4157059 You don't understand.<br />If you only knew who she really loved...
4157704 4159638 you wouldn't believe it.
4162576 4165170 Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
4165245 4168078 No, Capt. Butler, I wouldn't believe it.
4169817 4174186 There, there. Scarlett's going to get well<br />and there can be other babies.
4174488 4178219 No, she couldn't even if she wanted to,<br />after what she's been through.
4178292 4180260 But of course she could.
4180794 4182193 I'm going to.
4185132 4188363 No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.<br />It's too dangerous.
4188836 4191896 Children are life-renewing itself,<br />Capt. Butler...
4191972 4195464 and when life does that,<br />danger seems very unimportant.
4198579 4201673 I've never before known anyone<br />who was really brave.
4202449 4205384 I pray God things go well with you,<br />Miss Melly.
4205552 4209386 And I want to thank you for all<br />you've done for me and for Scarlett.
4210524 4212515 From my heart, I thank you.
4219266 4222565 Miss Scarlett's feeling<br />a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
4222636 4224103 Thank you, Mammy.
4231311 4233575 I've come to ask your forgiveness...
4233647 4236548 in the hope that we can give<br />our life together another chance.
4236617 4238209 Our life together?
4238285 4240685 When did we ever have a life together?
4241722 4243383 Yes, you're right.
4243857 4247315 But I'm sure if we could only try again,<br />we could be happy.
4248028 4250758 What is there to make us happy now?
4251231 4253392 Well, there's Bonnie and...
4254434 4256425 and I love you, Scarlett.
4256737 4258500 When did you discover that?
4258572 4262508 I've always loved you, but you've never<br />given me a chance to show it.
4263644 4266078 Well, and just what do you want me to do?
4267915 4270543 To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.
4270918 4272078 We'll go away.
4272152 4274382 We'll take Bonnie<br />and have another honeymoon.
4274454 4277184 Give up the mill? Why?<br />It's making more money than ever.
4277257 4279191 Yes, I know, but we don't need it.
4279259 4282092 Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.
4282162 4284096 Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.
4284164 4286997 Always Melanie! If you'd think<br />a little more about me...
4287067 4288398 I am thinking of you...
4289469 4291266 and I'm thinking that...
4291471 4294702 well, maybe it's the mill<br />that's taking you away from me...
4295008 4296236 and from Bonnie.
4296310 4299302 I know what you're thinking.<br />Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.
4299379 4301074 You're the one taking her away from me.
4301148 4302274 But she loves you.
4302349 4304783 You've done everything<br />to make her love you, not me.
4304851 4306113 She's so spoiled now that...
4306186 4307653 Mommy! Daddy!
4307921 4309149 Watch me!
4309423 4311254 We're watching, darling.
4311325 4313293 You're mighty pretty, precious.
4313360 4314622 So are you.
4315028 4317656 I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.
4318398 4321094 I don't think you ought to do<br />much jumping yet, Bonnie.
4321168 4323500 Remember, you've just learned<br />to ride sidesaddle.
4323570 4324901 I will so jump!
4325005 4327838 I can jump better than ever<br />'cause I've grown...
4327975 4329567 and I've moved the bar higher.
4329643 4331440 Don't let her do it, Rhett.
4331511 4335607 No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,<br />don't cry and blame me.
4336583 4338073 Rhett, stop her!
4340053 4341179 Bonnie!
4341989 4342978 Bonnie!
4344358 4345848 Just like Pa.
4349329 4350819 Just like Pa!
4352065 4353157 Bonnie!
4361742 4362868 Bonnie!
4363510 4364670 Bonnie!
4381328 4384297 Lordsy, Miss Melly.<br />I sure is glad you've come.
4386933 4389834 This house won't seem<br />the same without Bonnie.
4389903 4391768 How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
4391838 4394671 Miss Melly, this here done<br />broke her heart...
4395409 4398003 but I didn't fetch you here<br />on Miss Scarlett's account.
4398078 4402276 What that child got to stand,<br />the good Lord give her strength to stand.
4403850 4406216 It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
4409690 4412181 He done lost his mind<br />these last couple of days.
4412292 4413725 No, Mammy, no.
4414194 4418130 I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,<br />set such store on any child.
4418932 4421332 When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...
4421401 4425098 Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there<br />and shoot that poor pony...
4426073 4429099 and for a minute I think<br />he going to shoot hisself.
4429176 4430939 Oh, poor Capt. Butler.
4431011 4435744 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him<br />a murderer for teaching that child to jump.
4436249 4439013 She say, "You give me my baby<br />what you kill. "
4439086 4442817 And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't<br />never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
4443356 4447383 It like to turn my blood cold,<br />the things they say to one another.
4447894 4450385 Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
4453166 4454929 And then that night...
4455969 4459769 Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br />in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...
4460407 4462068 and he wouldn't even open the door...
4462142 4464372 when Miss Scarlett beat on it<br />and hollered to him.
4464444 4466708 And that's the way it's been<br />for two whole days.
4466813 4468007 Oh, Mammy.
4469116 4472608 And then this evening, Miss Scarlett,<br />she shout through the door...
4472686 4474950 and she say the funeral set<br />for tomorrow morning...
4475021 4478047 and he says, "You try that<br />and I kills you tomorrow.
4478125 4481094 "Do you think I's going to put my child...
4481161 4483425 "in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
4483497 4486193 Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.
4486266 4489929 Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.<br />He ain't going to let us bury that child.
4490003 4491994 You gotta help us, Miss Melly.
4492172 4493799 Oh, but I can't intrude.
4493874 4496138 If you can't help us, who can?
4496209 4499235 Mr. Rhett always set great store<br />by your opinion.
4501281 4503044 Please, Miss Melly.
4504618 4506518 I'll do what I can, Mammy.
4513193 4515627 Get away from that door,<br />and leave us alone.
4515695 4517720 It's Mrs. Wilkes, Capt. Butler.
4517798 4519390 Please let me in.
4519466 4521457 I've come to see Bonnie.
4542422 4543787 Oh, Lord...
4544224 4547250 please help Mr. Rhett<br />in this hour of his grief.
4559206 4562437 I want you to go and make<br />a good deal of strong coffee...
4562509 4566104 and bring it up to Capt. Butler.<br />I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
4566580 4567808 But...
4567981 4571280 Capt. Butler is quite willing<br />for the funeral to take place...
4571351 4572545 tomorrow morning.
4572619 4577352 Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights<br />on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.
4578658 4580285 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
4580894 4582020 Miss Melly!
4582095 4583756 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
4585498 4587466 Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...
4588168 4589430 and try...
4589502 4591163 try to get me home.
4592873 4594431 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
4602282 4604682 Where is my mother going away to?
4604851 4607752 And why can't I go along, please?
4608288 4611621 We can't always go along, Beau,<br />much as we may want to.
4613326 4615521 You're going back to bed now.
4616162 4619359 Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!
4620100 4621499 She hasn't your strength.
4621568 4624867 She's never had any strength.<br />She's never had anything but heart.
4625372 4626805 You knew that, too.
4626873 4629706 Why do I have to go back to bed?<br />It's morning.
4630410 4632435 It isn't really morning yet.
4638685 4640346 You may come in now, Scarlett.
4640420 4641978 Please let me see her!
4642055 4645684 I've been waiting here two whole days<br />and I've got to tell her...
4646026 4647653 that I was wrong about something.
4647727 4650753 She knows you were wrong.<br />She wants to see Scarlett.
4654334 4656029 Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
4656102 4658900 I won't have you easing your conscience<br />telling her things...
4658972 4661338 that make no difference now.<br />You understand?
4676289 4677620 It's me, Melly.
4679359 4680758 Promise me?
4681428 4682417 Anything.
4683697 4685460 Look after my little son.
4686866 4689130 I gave him to you once before.
4690236 4691703 Remember?
4692572 4694199 The day he was born.
4694574 4698203 Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<br />I know you'll get well.
4698645 4699942 Promise me...
4700547 4701639 college...
4701715 4705913 Yes, and Europe, and a pony,<br />whatever he wants. But...
4707087 4708611 Melly, do try...
4708722 4709984 Ashley...
4711758 4713316 Ashley and you.
4715562 4718326 What about Ashley, Melly?
4719833 4722028 Look after him for me.
4722802 4724394 Just as you...
4725505 4728599 looked after me for him.
4731011 4732569 I will, Melly.
4733713 4735408 Look after him...
4736116 4738949 but never let him know.
4749095 4750494 Good night.
4752065 4753362 Promise?
4754734 4756361 What else, Melly?
4757203 4758966 Capt. Butler...
4760373 4761840 be kind to him.
4762542 4763566 Rhett?
4764411 4766038 He loves you so.
4770150 4771481 Yes, Melly.
4774487 4775818 Goodbye.
4777123 4778385 Goodbye.
4794441 4796500 You ladies may come in now.
4801915 4803246 Ashley.
4804117 4806711 I don't know where the mate to this is.
4807687 4809780 She must have put it away.
4810457 4811856 Oh, stop it.
4812425 4813517 Hold me.
4813927 4815519 I'm so frightened.
4817363 4818990 I'm so frightened.
4823937 4827737 Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?<br />I can't live without her, I can't.
4829109 4831009 Everything I ever had...
4831077 4832738 is going with her.
4833780 4835042 Oh, Ashley.
4836549 4838847 You really love her, don't you?
4839652 4844351 She's the only dream I ever had<br />that didn't die in the face of reality.
4845158 4848525 Dreams! Always dreams with you,<br />never common sense.
4848595 4851826 Oh, Scarlett!<br />If you knew what I've gone through!
4852532 4856628 Ashley, you should have told me years ago<br />that you loved her and not me...
4856703 4859638 and not left me dangling<br />with your talk of honor.
4860039 4863236 But you had to wait till now,<br />now when Melly's dying...
4863877 4867244 to show me that I could never mean<br />any more to you than...
4867313 4870009 than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
4872018 4874418 And I've loved something that...
4874521 4876580 that doesn't really exist.
4879092 4880320 Somehow...
4881661 4883026 I don't care.
4884564 4886259 Somehow it doesn't matter.
4888401 4890835 It doesn't matter one bit.
4895141 4897006 Ashley, forgive me.
4897377 4900278 Don't cry.<br />She mustn't see you've been crying.
4900813 4902075 Ashley!
4905485 4906782 Melly!
4908655 4909986 Melly!
4914427 4916418 Rhett, Rhett!
4919866 4921663 Rhett, where are you?
4925738 4927171 Rhett, wait for me.
4932245 4933712 Rhett, wait for me!
4961040 4962200 Rhett.
4965378 4966470 Come in.
4974487 4975749 Rhett...
4976222 4977780 Melanie, she's...
4981661 4982821 Well, God rest her.
4983596 4986724 She was the only completely kind person<br />I ever knew.
4987467 4988798 A great lady.
4989235 4990896 A very great lady.
4993273 4996674 So she's dead.<br />That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
4997510 5001241 Oh, how can you say such a thing?<br />You know how I loved her, really!
5002715 5004376 No, I don't know that I do.
5004450 5007977 But at least it's to your credit<br />that you could appreciate her at the end.
5008054 5011683 Of course I appreciated her.<br />She thought of everybody except herself.
5012492 5014323 Why, her last words were about you.
5015662 5017061 What did she say?
5017130 5018290 She said:
5018564 5021556 "Be kind to Capt. Butler. He loves you so. "
5027440 5028600 Did she say anything else?
5028675 5030165 She said...
5030610 5033272 She asked me to look after Ashley, too.
5035515 5038951 It's convenient to have<br />the first wife's permission, isn't it?
5040987 5042614 What do you mean?
5044924 5046687 What are you doing?
5046759 5048590 I'm leaving you, my dear.
5048661 5052529 All you need now is a divorce,<br />and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
5055601 5057159 Oh, no!
5057904 5060134 No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!
5060206 5063334 I don't want a divorce.<br />Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...
5063476 5066036 when I knew I loved you,<br />I ran home to tell you.
5066112 5068012 Oh, darling, darling...
5068181 5069773 Please don't go on with this.
5069849 5073478 Leave us some dignity to remember<br />out of our marriage. Spare us this last.
5073553 5074679 This last?
5075054 5076749 Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.
5076823 5080691 I must have loved you for years, only I was<br />such a stupid fool I didn't know it.
5080760 5083092 Please believe me. You must care.
5083629 5085324 Melly said you did.
5085531 5088056 I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?
5089202 5091363 I never really loved Ashley.
5092004 5095599 You certainly gave a good imitation of it,<br />up till this morning.
5096542 5098772 No, Scarlett. I tried everything.
5099145 5102171 If you'd only met me halfway,<br />even when I came back from London.
5102248 5105911 I was so glad to see you.<br />I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
5106018 5109249 And then, when you were sick<br />and it was all my fault...
5109322 5112155 I hoped against hope<br />that you'd call for me, but you didn't.
5112225 5116525 I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,<br />but I didn't think you wanted me.
5118030 5122057 It seems we've been at cross-purposes,<br />doesn't it? But it's no use now.
5123069 5126698 As long as there was Bonnie,<br />there was a chance we might be happy.
5126773 5128502 I liked to think that Bonnie was you.
5128574 5132374 A little girl again, before the war<br />and poverty had done things to you.
5133079 5137607 She was so like you, and I could pet her<br />and spoil her as I wanted to spoil you.
5139652 5142018 But when she went, she took everything.
5142088 5143248 Oh, Rhett!
5143723 5145554 Rhett, please don't say that.
5145625 5148788 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.
5150563 5152963 My darling, you're such a child.
5153132 5157159 You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"<br />all the past can be corrected.
5159839 5162137 Here, take my handkerchief.
5162408 5166401 Never at any crisis of your life<br />have I known you to have a handkerchief.
5170783 5173411 Rhett, where are you going?
5173486 5175818 I'm going to Charleston.<br />Back where I belong.
5175888 5178254 Please. Please take me with you.
5178891 5181416 No. I'm through with everything here.
5182228 5183752 I want peace.
5183896 5188230 I want to see if somewhere there isn't<br />something left in life of charm and grace.
5188968 5193132 - Do you know what I'm talking about?<br />- No. I only know that I love you.
5193206 5194833 That's your misfortune.
5194907 5196169 Oh, Rhett.
5201414 5202506 Rhett!
5208788 5209880 Rhett!
5209989 5212958 If you go, where shall I go?<br />What shall I do?
5214227 5216889 Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
5230443 5232877 Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!
5233746 5236340 There must be some way<br />to bring him back.
5239085 5242282 I can't think about this now.<br />I'll go crazy if I do!
5244056 5246251 I'll think about it tomorrow.
5260540 5262599 But I must think about it.
5263409 5265172 I must think about it.
5266245 5267906 What is there to do?
5269081 5271106 What is there that matters?
5274287 5276482 <i>Do you mean to tell me,<br />Katie Scarlett O'Hara...</i>
5276556 5280652 <i>that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?<br />Why, land's the only thing that matters.</i>
5281027 5283120 <i>It's the only thing that lasts.</i>
5283362 5287025 <i>Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.</i>
5287233 5290862 <i>It's this from which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.</i>
5290937 5294771 <i>Why, land's the only thing that matters.<br />It's the only thing that lasts.</i>
5294840 5298037 <i>Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.</i>
5298110 5300874 <i>From which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.</i>
5300947 5302676 <i>Why, land's the only thing that matters.</i>
5302748 5304181 <i>Something you love better than me.</i>
5304250 5305478 <i>The red earth of Tara.</i>
5305551 5307178 <i>- Tara!<br />- Tara!</i>
5310790 5311950 Tara!
5313092 5314252 Home!
5315461 5316985 I'll go home!
5317997 5320625 And I'll think of some way to get him back.
5321267 5322632 After all...
5323202 5325796 tomorrow is another day.
