411464 414064 What do we care if we were expelled<br />from college?
414138 417164 The war is gonna start any day.<br />We would've left college anyhow.
417241 418970 War! lsn't it exciting, Scarlett?
419043 421034 Do you know those Yankees<br />actually want a war?
421112 423307 -We'll show 'em.<br />-Fiddle-dee-dee!
423447 424641 War, war, war!
424882 427749 This war talk's spoiling all the fun<br />at every party this spring.
427818 430116 I get so bored I could scream!
430454 433651 -Besides, there isn't going to be any war.<br />-Not gonna be any war?
433724 436124 Why, honey, of course<br />there's going to be a war!
436193 440220 If either of you says "war" just once again,<br />I'll go in the house and slam the door.
440298 443392 -But, Scarlett, honey--<br />-Don't you want us to have a war?
449307 450433 Well...
451709 452937 ...but remember...
453411 454639 ...l warned you.
454979 456412 I've got an idea.
456480 458948 We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue<br />at Twelve Oaks.
459016 461746 That's a good idea.<br />Aren't you eating barbecue with us?
461819 464947 I hadn't thought about that yet.<br />I'll think about that tomorrow.
465022 466284 We want all your waltzes.
466357 468882 First Brent, then me, then Brent,<br />then me again and so on.
468993 470961 -Promise?<br />-I'd just love to.
472029 475556 If only I didn't have<br />every one of them taken already.
475633 477362 Why, honey, you can't do that to us.
477435 480097 -How about if we tell you a secret?<br />-A secret? Who about?
480171 481934 Do you know Miss Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta?
482006 484600 Ashley Wilkes' cousin.<br />She's visiting the Wilkes'--
484675 487610 That goody-goody!<br />Who wants to know a secret about her?
487678 489305 Anyway, we heard, that is, they say--
489380 493407 -Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.<br />-The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
493484 495179 Now do we get those waltzes?
495419 496750 Of course.
497655 501887 -I'll bet the other boys will be hopping mad.<br />-Let 'em be mad. We two can handle 'em!
502493 504723 It can't be true. Ashley loves me!
504795 505955 Scarlett!
506364 507991 What has gotten into her?
508065 509828 Do you suppose we made her mad?
509900 513996 Where're you goin' without your shawl,<br />and the night air fixin' to set in?
514071 516631 How come you didn't ask them gentlemen<br />to stay for supper?
516707 518675 You ain't got no more manners<br />than a field hand...
518743 520870 ...after me and Miss Ellen done labored<br />with you.
520945 523436 Miss Scarlett, come on in the house!
523581 525845 Come on in before you catch<br />your death of dampness.
525916 528578 No! I'll wait for Pa to come home<br />from the Wilkes'.
528652 530244 Come on in here!
530821 532288 Come on!
547438 548700 Quittin' time!
548839 550238 Who says it's quittin' time?
550307 551467 I says it's quittin' time.
551542 554943 I's the foreman. I's the one that says<br />when it's quittin' time at Tara!
555012 556604 Quittin' time!
557048 558982 Quittin' time!
599924 603189 There's none in the county can touch you,<br />and none in the state.
604562 605586 Pa!
605896 608194 So it's proud of yourself, you are.
610401 612266 Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara!
612336 615772 So, you've been spying on me,<br />and like your sister, Suellen...
615840 618104 ...you'll tell your mother<br />I was jumping again.
618175 621508 Pa, you know I'm no tattletale like Suellen,<br />but it does seem to me...
621579 624412 ...after you broke your knee last year<br />jumping that same fence--
624482 628976 I'll not have me own daughter tellin' me<br />what I shall jump and not jump.
629053 630577 It's my own neck, so it is.
630721 634589 All right, Pa, you jump what you please.<br />How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?
634658 635682 The Wilkeses?
635759 639855 Just as you'd expect with the barbecue<br />tomorrow and talking nothing but war.
639930 642694 Oh, bother the war.<br />Was there anyone else there?
642766 646133 Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton,<br />from Atlanta and her brother, Charles.
646203 647568 Melanie Hamilton!
647638 649833 She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny.<br />I hate her.
649907 651431 Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
651509 654569 Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.
655045 657479 What's your interest in Ashley<br />and Miss Melanie?
658749 660944 It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.
661018 664181 Has he been trifling with you?<br />Has he asked you to marry him?
664255 665688 -No!<br />-No, nor will he.
665756 668987 I have it in strictest confidence<br />from John Wilkes this afternoon...
669059 670754 ...Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.
670828 673388 It will be announced tomorrow night<br />at the ball.
673964 675454 I don't believe it.
675633 677760 Here! Here! Where are you off to?
678002 678991 Scarlett!
679937 681768 What are you about?
682206 684970 Have you made a spectacle of yourself<br />running after a man...
685042 688136 ...who's not in love with you when<br />you might have any man in the county?
688312 691748 I haven't been running after him.<br />It's just a surprise, that's all.
691815 694648 Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.
694718 698154 If Ashley wanted to marry you,<br />it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes".
698289 701781 I want my girl to be happy.<br />You'd not be happy with him.
701892 703189 I would, I would!
703327 705124 What difference does it make<br />who you marry...
705196 707687 ...so long as he's a Southerner<br />and thinks like you?
707765 710131 And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.
710201 712669 I don't want Tara.<br />Plantations don't mean anything when--
712736 717435 You mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,<br />that land doesn't mean anything to you?
717508 720136 Why, land is the only thing in the world<br />worth working for...
720211 723977 ...worth fighting for, worth dying for,<br />because it's the only thing that lasts.
724181 727708 -Oh, Pa, you talk like an lrishman.<br />-It's proud I am that I'm lrish.
727785 731346 And don't you be forgetting, Missy,<br />that you're half lrish too.
731422 733822 And to anyone with a drop of lrish blood<br />in them...
733891 736121 ...why, the land they live on<br />is like their mother.
736193 740755 Oh, but you're just a child.<br />It'll come to you, this love of the land.
740831 743197 There's no getting away from it<br />if you're lrish.
768125 769149 Yonder she comes!
769226 772024 Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,<br />your ma's home!
772096 774963 Actin' like a wet nurse<br />to them low-down, poor white trash...
775065 778557 ...instead of bein' here eatin' her supper.<br />Cookie, stir up the fire!
778636 781127 Miss Ellen's got no business<br />wearin' herself out.
781672 784140 Take the lamp out on the porch!<br />Wearin' herself out.
784208 786472 Mist' Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.
786610 788703 Wearin' herself out<br />waitin' on the poor white trash.
788779 790940 Shut up, dogs!<br />Barkin' in the house like that.
791015 793609 Get up from there. Don't you hear<br />that Miss Ellen's comin'?
793684 796016 Get out there and get her medicine chest.
796420 798718 We was gettin' worried about you,<br />Miss Ellen.
798789 801417 -Mist' Gerald--<br />-All right, Pork. I'm home.
801859 805522 Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing<br />the creek bottom today.
805596 808190 What do you want me<br />to start on tomorrow?
808265 811996 Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come<br />from Emmy Slattery's bedside.
812136 813694 Your child has been born.
813804 817035 My child, ma'am?<br />I'm sure I don't understand.
817207 819539 Has been born and, mercifully, has died.
820411 822072 Goodnight, Mr. Wilkerson.
825582 827743 I'll fix your supper for you myself,<br />and you eats it.
827818 829046 After prayers, Mammy.
829119 830245 Yes, ma'am.
831455 832786 Mr. O'Hara.
833357 834984 You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
835059 838551 Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?<br />He's the best overseer in the county.
838696 840755 He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.
840831 841923 But....
843400 844492 -No!<br />-Yes.
845903 848633 The Yankee Wilkerson<br />and the white-trash Slattery girl!
848706 850674 We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
850774 852002 Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
857648 859343 I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!
859416 862112 I don't like your tone, Suellen.<br />Your pink gown is lovely.
862186 865713 -Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?<br />-But you may wear my garnets with it.
865789 868383 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
868559 870220 Scarlett...
870294 872854 ...you look tired, my dear.<br />I'm worried about you.
873764 875095 I'm all right, Mother.
875199 877633 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
877701 879066 I'm 13 now.
879169 881467 You may go to the barbecue<br />and stay up through supper.
881538 883768 I didn't want to wear<br />your tacky green dress anyhow, stingy!
883841 884773 Oh, hush up!
884842 886332 Prayers, girls.
893083 898111 "And to all the saints, that I have sinned<br />exceedingly in thought, word and deed...
898355 899652 "...through my fault.
899857 903020 "Through my fault,<br />through my most grievous fault.
903494 906827 "Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary,<br />ever Virgin...
906964 909228 "...Blessed Michael, the Archangel...
909400 911300 "...Blessed John the Baptist...
911368 913632 "...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...
914304 917296 "...and all the saints<br />to pray to the Lord, our God, for me."
917408 919467 But Ashley doesn't know I love him!
920677 924340 I'll tell him that I love him<br />and then he can't marry her!
925516 928644 "May the Almighty,<br />and most merciful Lord...
928719 930653 "...grant us pardon, absolution...
931121 932850 "...and remission of our sins. Amen."
935426 937690 Just hold on and suck in.
938762 941026 Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.
941265 943699 You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.
943767 945359 Oh, yes, ma'am, you is!
945536 947800 You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.
948806 950831 No, I'm not!
953577 955636 Put on the dress,<br />because we're late already.
955712 957612 -What's my lamb gonna wear?<br />-That.
957681 961708 No you ain't! You can't show your bosom<br />before three o'clock.
961919 963750 I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!
963821 967188 If you say one word to Mother,<br />I won't eat a bite!
971328 972352 Well....
978936 982235 Keep your shawl on.<br />I ain't aimin' for you to get all freckled...
982306 986436 ...after the buttermilk I done put on you<br />all this winter, bleachin' them freckles.
992716 996652 Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on<br />and be good, and eat just a little, honey.
996720 997778 No.
998088 1001888 I'm going to have a good time today<br />and do my eating at the barbecue.
1002125 1004889 If you don't care what folks says<br />about this family, I does!
1004962 1008227 I has told you and told you<br />that you can always tell a lady...
1008298 1010493 ...by the way she eats with folks.<br />Like a bird!
1010567 1012626 I ain't aimin' for you to go after<br />Mr. Wilkes...
1012703 1014898 ...and eat like a field hand<br />and gobble like a hog!
1014972 1016303 Fiddle-dee-dee!
1016740 1020107 Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl<br />with a healthy appetite.
1020244 1023111 What gentlemen says and what they thinks<br />is two different things.
1023180 1026946 And I ain't noticed Mist' Ashley<br />askin' to marry you!
1042332 1046268 Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need<br />of havin' it come right back up again.
1048805 1051740 Why does a girl have to be so silly<br />to catch a husband?
1051975 1057038 Scarlett, ifyou're not here by the time<br />I count ten, we'll be goin' without you!
1057214 1058272 I'm coming, Pa!
1058448 1059506 One...
1059583 1061210 ...two, three...
1061919 1063978 ...four, five, six....
1065022 1066148 Oh, dear!
1066390 1070121 My stays are so tight I know I'll never get<br />through the day without belching.
1094985 1098751 Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day<br />you'll be having for the barbecue.
1098956 1101925 So it seems, Gerald.<br />But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
1101992 1104051 She's after settling accounts<br />with the overseer.
1104127 1105822 But she'll be along for the ball tonight.
1105896 1107727 Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
1107798 1109823 Thank you kindly, lndia.
1109900 1112596 Your daughter's getting prettier every day,<br />John.
1113136 1116128 India, here are the O'Hara girls.<br />We must greet them.
1116206 1119403 I can't stand Scarlett. If you saw<br />the way she throws herself at Ashley.
1119509 1121534 Now, that's your brother's business.
1121612 1124240 You must remember your duties<br />as hostess.
1124314 1125576 Good morning, girls.
1127117 1128744 Good morning, Scarlett.
1129453 1131944 Why, lndia Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
1132022 1135253 -Perfectly lovely, darling.<br />-I just can't take my eyes off it.
1137194 1138252 Scarlett, honey....
1138328 1140319 You're looking mighty fine this morning.
1140397 1142695 -Good morning, Miss Scarlett.<br />-Good morning.
1143300 1145325 -It's a pleasure to see you.<br />-Good morning.
1145402 1146630 Howdy, Miss Scarlett.
1148271 1149295 Ashley!
1151708 1153266 Scarlett, my dear.
1154778 1156905 I've been looking for you everywhere.
1156980 1158948 I've got something I must tell you.
1159116 1162608 -Can't we go some place where it's quiet?<br />-Yes, I'd like to, but l...
1162819 1164810 ...l have something to tell you too.
1164888 1167652 Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
1168525 1170925 But come say hello<br />to my cousin, Melanie, first.
1170994 1172586 Oh, do we have to?
1172896 1175729 She's been looking forward<br />to seeing you again.
1175899 1176923 Melanie!
1178068 1179592 Here's Scarlett.
1180070 1181037 Scarlett!
1182606 1184233 I'm so glad to see you again.
1184408 1187400 Melanie Hamilton!<br />What a surprise to run into you here.
1187577 1189704 I hope you'll stay with us<br />a few days at least.
1189780 1193307 I hope I shall stay long enough for us<br />to become real friends, Scarlett.
1193450 1194917 I do so want us to be.
1194985 1196885 We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?
1196953 1199421 We'll just have to make the biggest fuss<br />over her, won't we?
1199489 1202458 If there's anybody knows how to give a girl<br />a good time, it's Ashley.
1202526 1205757 Though I expect our good times will seem<br />silly to you because you're so serious.
1205829 1208525 Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
1208832 1210322 I've always admired you so.
1210400 1212027 I wish I could be more like you.
1212102 1215037 You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,<br />and say things you don't mean.
1215105 1218563 Nobody could accuse Melanie<br />of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
1219109 1221168 Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?
1221244 1223644 Ashley never means a word he says<br />to any girl.
1224214 1227706 Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,<br />you handsome old thing, you!
1227784 1229376 But, oh, Miss O'Hara, l....
1229453 1231717 Was it kind to bring<br />your good-looking brother here...
1231788 1234256 ...just to break my poor, simple,<br />country-girl's heart?
1234524 1236549 She never even noticed Charles before.
1236626 1238890 Because he's your beau,<br />she's after him like a hornet.
1238962 1241522 Charles Hamilton,<br />I want to eat barbecue with you.
1241598 1245295 Mind you, don't go philandering with<br />any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.
1245368 1246767 I won't, Miss O'Hara!
1247237 1248499 I couldn't!
1249005 1251701 I do declare, Frank Kennedy,<br />if you don't look dashing...
1251775 1253106 ...with that new set of whiskers!
1253176 1255667 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
1256113 1258877 Charles and Rafe asked me<br />to eat barbecue with them...
1258982 1261177 ...but I told them I couldn't<br />because I promised you.
1261251 1264846 You needn't be so amused. Look at her!<br />She's after your beau now!
1265255 1268053 Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1268592 1270583 I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.
1270894 1273488 What's your sister so mad about?<br />You sparkin' her beau?
1273630 1276690 As if I couldn't get a better beau<br />than that old maid in britches.
1276767 1280100 Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome<br />old things, you! No, you're not!
1280170 1281694 I won't say that. I'm mad at you!
1281772 1282796 What have we done?
1282873 1285068 You haven't been near me all day.<br />I wore this old dress...
1285142 1286507 ...'cause I thought you liked it.
1286576 1288544 I was counting on eating barbecue<br />with you two.
1288612 1290876 -Well, you are, Scarlett.<br />-Of course, you are.
1291047 1294983 Oh, I never can make up my mind<br />which of you two is the handsomer.
1295318 1298481 I was awake all last night trying<br />to figure it out.
1304060 1305789 Cathleen, who's that?
1305929 1306896 Who?
1306963 1308988 That man looking at us and smiling.
1309366 1310560 The nasty, dark one.
1310667 1314694 My dear, don't you know?<br />That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.
1314771 1316898 He has the most terrible reputation.
1321745 1324976 He looks as if, as if he knows<br />what I look like without my shimmy!
1325048 1326106 Scarlett!
1326483 1328280 Why, my dear, he isn't received!
1328652 1330210 He spends a lot of time up North...
1330287 1332812 ...because his folks in Charleston<br />won't even speak to him.
1332889 1335221 He was expelled from West Point,<br />he's so fast.
1335292 1338557 And then there's that business<br />about that girl he wouldn't marry.
1338628 1339652 Tell, tell!
1339830 1344062 Well, he took her out buggy riding<br />in the late afternoon without a chaperon!
1344634 1347125 And then he refused to marry her!
1350740 1353334 No, but she was ruined just the same.
1359082 1360606 Ashley!
1360784 1361876 Happy?
1361985 1362974 So happy!
1364721 1366848 You seem to belong here...
1367290 1369724 ...as if it had all been imagined for you.
1371127 1373527 I like to feel that I belong<br />to the things you love.
1373597 1375189 You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
1375265 1376323 Yes, Ashley.
1376733 1378223 I love it as...
1378301 1379825 ...as more than a house.
1380470 1384463 It's a whole world that wants only<br />to be graceful and beautiful.
1384608 1386769 It's so unaware that it may not last...
1387510 1388602 ...forever.
1388678 1391943 You're afraid of what may happen<br />if the war comes, aren't you?
1392082 1394676 But we don't have to be afraid for us.
1395252 1397720 No war can come into our world, Ashley.
1398722 1400019 Whatever comes...
1400724 1403454 ...l'll love you, just as I do now...
1404227 1405353 ...until I die.
1410467 1412196 Isn't this better than sitting at a table?
1412269 1414737 A girl hasn't got but two sides to her<br />at a table.
1416139 1417231 I'll go get her dessert.
1417307 1419707 -Here, she said me.<br />-Allow me, Miss O'Hara.
1421945 1423139 I think....
1426449 1429247 I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
1430854 1432515 Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!
1433056 1434284 Thank you.
1434524 1435650 Go get it.
1435825 1437952 Isn't he the luckiest...?
1445268 1446292 Miss O'Hara...
1447837 1448826 ...l love you.
1450440 1452840 I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
1456246 1459044 Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.
1459316 1461648 Well-brought-up young ladies<br />take naps at parties.
1461718 1465654 And it's high time you started behavin' and<br />actin' like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
1465722 1469158 When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice<br />any Yankee girls taking naps.
1469225 1473093 No, and you ain't gonna see<br />no Yankee girls at the ball tonight neither.
1473263 1474855 How was Ashley today, Scarlett?
1474931 1477525 He didn't seem to be paying<br />much attention to you.
1477667 1479396 You mind your own business!
1479636 1481831 You'll be lucky not to lose<br />ol' whisker-face Kennedy.
1481905 1483202 You've liked Ashley for months!
1483273 1485707 His engagement's gonna be announced<br />tonight. Pa said so this morning.
1485775 1486935 That's all you know.
1488011 1490775 Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!<br />You all behave yourselves.
1490947 1492574 Actin' like poor, white-trash children!
1492649 1495618 If you's old enough to go to parties,<br />you's old enough to act like ladies.
1495685 1496811 Who cares!
1548171 1550696 We've borne enough insults<br />from the meddling Yankees.
1550774 1553538 It's time we made them understand<br />we'll keep our slaves...
1553610 1555043 ...with or without their approval.
1555111 1557909 'Twas the sovereign right of the<br />state of Georgia to secede from the Union!
1557981 1558913 That's right!
1558982 1561576 The South must assert herself<br />by force of arms.
1562018 1566182 After we've fired on the Yankee rascals<br />at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!
1566356 1568722 -There's no other way!<br />-Fight! That's right. Fight!
1568792 1570521 Let the Yankees ask for peace!
1570593 1574222 The situation is very simple.<br />The Yankees can't fight and we can.
1575265 1576698 There won't even be a battle.
1576766 1578393 They'll just turn and run every time.
1578468 1580265 One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.
1580336 1582270 We'll finish them in one battle.
1582338 1584272 Gentlemen can always fight better<br />than rabble.
1584340 1586672 Yes, gentlemen always can fight better<br />than rabble.
1586810 1588971 What does the captain of our troop say?
1589145 1592581 Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights<br />I go with her.
1593516 1596849 But, like my father, I hope that the Yankees<br />will let us leave the Union in peace.
1596920 1598547 -But, Ashley....<br />-But, Ashley, they've insulted us!
1598621 1600521 You can't mean you don't want war!
1600590 1604026 Most of the miseries of the world<br />were caused by wars.
1604160 1608153 And when the wars were over<br />no one ever knew what they were about.
1608231 1609698 If it wasn't that I knew you--
1609766 1613793 Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been<br />up North, I hear.
1613937 1615996 Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?
1616539 1619099 I think it's hard winning a war with words,<br />gentlemen.
1619175 1620574 What do you mean, sir?
1620710 1623543 There's not a cannon factory<br />in the whole South.
1623613 1625547 What difference does that make<br />to a gentleman?
1625615 1628846 It'll make a great deal of difference<br />to a great many gentlemen, sir.
1628918 1631751 Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,<br />that the Yankees can lick us?
1631821 1633015 No, I'm not hinting.
1633089 1636149 I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees<br />are better equipped than we.
1636226 1638524 They've got factories, shipyards,<br />coal mines...
1638595 1641428 ...and a fleet to bottle up our harbors<br />and starve us to death.
1641498 1644831 All we've got is cotton and slaves<br />and arrogance.
1645034 1648561 -That's Yankee treachery!<br />-Sir, I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
1648671 1650195 I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
1650273 1652571 Apologies aren't enough, sir!
1652742 1655540 I hear you were turned out of West Point,<br />Mr. Rhett Butler...
1655612 1659844 ...and you aren't received by any decent<br />family in Charleston, not even your own!
1664287 1667256 I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
1669058 1671788 Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about<br />and look over your place.
1671861 1675160 I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy<br />and cigars and...
1675698 1677063 ...dreams of victory.
1684040 1687567 That'sjust about what you could expect<br />from somebody like Rhett Butler.
1687644 1689441 You did everything but call him out.
1689512 1690672 He refused to fight.
1690747 1693648 Not quite that, Charles.<br />He refused to take advantage of you.
1693716 1694683 Take advantage of me?
1694817 1696341 He's one of the best shots in the country...
1696419 1697943 ...as he's proved a number of times...
1698021 1699955 ...against steadier hands and cooler heads<br />than yours.
1700023 1701320 -I'll show him!<br />-Now, please.
1701391 1703916 Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
1703993 1706826 You may be needed<br />for more important fighting, Charles.
1707130 1709564 Now, if you'll excuse me,<br />Mr. Butler is our guest.
1709632 1711725 I think I'll just show him around.
1724480 1725572 Ashley!
1733156 1734714 Ashley!
1735291 1736349 Scarlett.
1738194 1740389 Who're you hiding from in here?
1745535 1747230 What are you up to?
1749272 1752298 Well, why aren't you upstairs resting<br />with the other girls?
1753610 1755635 What is this, Scarlett? A secret?
1756045 1758411 Oh, Ashley, Ashley...
1759082 1760242 ...l love you.
1760617 1761641 Scarlett!
1761718 1763185 I love you, I do!
1765521 1769184 Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered<br />every other man's heart today?
1769259 1771659 You've always had mine.<br />You cut your teeth on it.
1771728 1773355 Oh, don't tease me now.
1773429 1776227 Have I your heart, my darling?<br />I love you, I love you.
1776299 1779928 You mustn't say such things.<br />You'll hate me for hearing them.
1780036 1784200 Oh, I could never hate you,<br />and I know you must care about me.
1784607 1786734 Oh, you do care, don't you?
1787977 1789103 Yes...
1789679 1790805 ...l care.
1792248 1795115 Oh, can't we go away and forget<br />we ever said these things?
1796953 1798614 But how can we do that?
1798955 1801185 Don't you want to marry me?
1801324 1802848 I'm going to marry Melanie.
1803092 1805458 But you can't. Not if you care for me.
1805528 1808656 Oh, my dear, why must you make me<br />say things that will hurt you?
1809565 1811624 How can I make you understand?
1812435 1814027 You're so young and unthinking.
1814103 1815434 You don't know what marriage means.
1815505 1817939 I know I love you,<br />and I want to be your wife.
1818107 1819540 You don't love Melanie.
1819676 1821143 She's like me, Scarlett.
1821544 1824274 She's part of my blood<br />and we understand each other.
1824580 1826445 But you love me.
1826683 1828310 How could I help loving you?
1828818 1831343 You have all the passion for life that I lack.
1831521 1833989 That kind of love isn't enough<br />for a successful marriage...
1834057 1835718 ...for two people as different as we are.
1835792 1839023 Well, why don't you say it, you coward?<br />You're afraid to marry me.
1839262 1841287 You'd rather live with that fool<br />who can't speak except...
1841364 1845164 ...to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel<br />of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.
1845234 1846724 You mustn't say such things<br />about Melanie.
1846803 1848532 Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
1848604 1851402 You led me on, you made me believe<br />you wanted to marry me.
1851474 1853806 Now, Scarlett, be fair.<br />I never, at any time--
1853876 1857403 You did, it's true you did!<br />I'll hate you till I die!
1858014 1861313 I can't think of anything bad enough<br />to call you.
1888311 1890176 Has the war started?
1890780 1894181 Sir, you should have made<br />your presence known.
1894484 1896645 In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
1896853 1899048 That wouldn't have been very tactful,<br />would it?
1899122 1901682 But don't worry,<br />your secret is safe with me.
1902291 1903383 Sir, you are no gentleman!
1903459 1905586 And you, Miss, are no lady.
1906062 1907893 Don't think I hold that against you.
1907964 1909693 Ladies have never held any charm for me.
1909766 1912792 First you take a low, common advantage<br />of me, then you insult me.
1912869 1916305 I meant it as a compliment<br />and I hope to see more of you...
1916372 1919205 ...when you're free of the spell<br />of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.
1919275 1923541 He doesn't strike me as half good enough<br />for a girl of your, what was it?
1923780 1925247 Your "passion for living."
1925448 1928076 How dare you!<br />You aren't fit to wipe his boots.
1929619 1932611 And you were going to hate him<br />for the rest of your life.
1934957 1938950 She certainly made a fool of herself<br />running after all the men at the barbecue.
1939028 1940689 That's not fair, lndia.
1940763 1943527 She's so attractive,<br />the menjust naturally flock to her.
1943633 1945897 Oh, Melanie, you're just too good<br />to be true.
1945968 1947833 Didn't you see her going after<br />your brother, Charles?
1947904 1949997 Yes, and she knows Charles belongs to me.
1950072 1951699 Oh, you're wrong, lndia.
1951774 1954834 Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
1955011 1957878 Men may flirt with girls like that<br />but they don't marry them.
1957947 1960142 I think you're being very mean to her.
1968791 1971760 War! War's declared! War!
1983439 1984838 Miss O'Hara!
1987944 1989104 Miss O'Hara!
1989312 1992611 Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,<br />volunteers to fight against us.
1992682 1995276 Don't you men ever think<br />of anything important?
1995351 1997717 But it's war and everybody's going off<br />to enlist.
1997820 1999344 They're going right away. I'm going too.
1999422 2000480 Everybody?
2004794 2007194 Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
2007597 2009224 To see us go, I mean.
2009732 2011666 I'll cry into my pillow every night.
2011801 2013792 Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
2013970 2018373 You're the most beautiful girl in the world,<br />and the sweetest and the dearest.
2018508 2020806 I know I couldn't hope<br />that you could love me.
2020877 2024335 I'm so clumsy and stupid<br />and not nearly good enough for you.
2024413 2028281 But if you could think of marrying me<br />I'd do anything in the world for you.
2028451 2029975 Just anything. I promise.
2030520 2031782 What did you say?
2031888 2034721 Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?
2040496 2042464 Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
2043065 2045329 You will? You'll marry me.<br />You'll wait for me?
2045768 2047030 I don't think I'd want to wait.
2047103 2049537 You mean you'll marry me before I go?
2050039 2052007 Oh, Miss O'Hara.
2052074 2053803 Scarlett....
2055478 2056968 When may I speak to your father?
2057046 2058104 The sooner the better.
2058180 2059738 I'll go now. I can't wait.
2059815 2061715 Will you excuse me, dear?
2066656 2068521 Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.
2068591 2070456 It'll be a week at least<br />before they call on me.
2070526 2073654 Only a week, and then they'll take you<br />away from me.
2106896 2109524 Scarlett, I thought of you<br />at our wedding yesterday...
2109599 2112693 ...and I hoped that yours would be<br />as beautiful, and it was.
2113336 2114360 Was it?
2114770 2117204 Now we're really and truly sisters.
2117873 2119363 -Charles.<br />-Melanie.
2127283 2130411 Don't cry, darling,<br />the war will be over in a few weeks...
2130486 2132613 ...and I'll be coming back to you.
2176732 2178097 Miss Scarlett!
2178768 2181931 Well, I don't care.<br />I'm too young to be a widow.
2182138 2183435 Miss Scarlett!
2185274 2187902 Why, I just go around scaring people<br />in that thing.
2188978 2191503 You ain't supposed to be around people.<br />You's in mournin'.
2191580 2193878 For what? I don't feel anything.
2194550 2197212 Why should I have to pretend<br />and pretend....
2197887 2199354 What is it?
2200089 2202182 Oh, baby....
2203526 2204515 What is it?
2204860 2206384 My life is over.
2206796 2209356 Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.
2211701 2213066 Oh, Mother.
2213135 2217299 I know you'll think I'm horrible,<br />but I just can't bear going around in black.
2217840 2220468 It's bad enough not being able<br />to go to any parties...
2220643 2222133 ...but looking this way too.
2222211 2224145 I don't think you're at all horrible.
2224280 2228114 It's only natural to want to look young<br />and be young when you are young.
2228684 2230413 Oh, baby....
2231387 2233355 How would you like<br />to go visiting somewhere?
2233422 2234582 Savannah perhaps?
2234657 2236716 What would I do in Savannah?
2236959 2238722 Well, Atlanta then.
2238794 2240989 There's lots going on there.
2241063 2244032 And you could stay<br />with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
2244967 2246127 Melanie.
2246569 2247695 Yes.
2248437 2249665 Yes, I could, couldn't l?
2249739 2252867 Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,<br />sweeter than anybody in the world.
2252942 2254307 You'd like it, really?
2254844 2258109 All right then.<br />Now stop your crying and smile.
2259915 2261576 You can take Prissy with you.
2262251 2264446 Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,<br />Mammy.
2264854 2266754 I'll go write the necessary letters.
2269892 2270881 Atlanta!
2271193 2274560 Savannah would be better for you.<br />You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.
2274630 2276097 What trouble are you talking about?
2276165 2279601 You know what trouble I's talkin' about.<br />I's talkin' about Mist' Ashley Wilkes.
2279668 2281533 He'll be comin' to Atlanta<br />when he gets his leave...
2281604 2284198 ...and you're sittin' there waitin'<br />for him just like a spider!
2284273 2287765 -He belongs to Miss Melanie--<br />-You go pack my things like Mother said.
2308798 2311596 They're all whispering,<br />and I just know it's about her.
2311734 2313565 What's it matter what they say,<br />Aunt Pittypat?
2313636 2318266 But Scarlett is living under my roof<br />so they all think I'm responsible for her...
2318440 2322171 ...and for a widow to appear in public<br />at a social gathering!
2322344 2324972 Every time I think of it I feel faint!
2325047 2329279 Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here<br />only to help raise money for the cause.
2329351 2332411 It was splendid of her<br />to make the sacrifice.
2332555 2334284 Anyone would think, to hear you talk...
2334356 2337848 ...that she came here to dance<br />instead of to sell things.
2350206 2351935 Ladies and gentlemen!
2352007 2354703 I have important news! Glorious news!
2355077 2358171 Another triumph<br />for our magnificent men in arms.
2358914 2362042 General Lee has completely<br />whipped the enemy.
2362218 2366211 And swept the Yankee Army<br />northward from Virginia.
2375331 2378459 And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
2378934 2383064 We have with us tonight that most daring<br />of all blockade-runners...
2383439 2386840 ...whose fleet schooners,<br />slipping past the Yankee guns...
2387076 2390910 ...have brought us here the very woolens<br />and laces we wear tonight.
2391113 2395174 I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that<br />will-o'-the-wisp of the bounding main.
2395384 2398182 None other than our friend<br />from Charleston...
2398487 2400045 ...Captain Rhett Butler!
2421010 2422409 Permit me.
2426715 2429912 Captain Butler, it's such a pleasure<br />to see you again.
2430219 2432244 I met you last at my husband's home.
2432354 2434584 That's kind of you to remember,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2434990 2437618 Did you meet Captain Butler<br />at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
2437693 2439786 Yes. I, I think so.
2440062 2442690 Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />It was in the library.
2442765 2444665 You had broken something.
2445768 2448202 Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
2448270 2452070 Ladies, the Confederacy asks for<br />your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.
2452374 2454433 We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.
2454510 2455772 Wait.
2456378 2458744 On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br />and Mrs. Hamilton.
2459782 2461113 Thank you, Captain Butler.
2461417 2463044 Just a moment, please.
2466121 2468146 But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
2468290 2471589 It may help my husband more,<br />off my finger.
2472227 2473353 Thank you.
2475831 2478391 That's a very beautiful thing to do,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2478901 2479959 Here.
2480235 2482795 You can have mine, too, for the cause.
2485074 2488942 And you, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />I know just how much that means to you.
2489244 2490609 -Melanie!<br />-Yes, Dr. Meade.
2490679 2493011 I need your approval,<br />as a member of the Committee...
2493082 2495607 ...for something we want to do<br />that's rather shocking.
2496318 2498309 Will you excuse us, please?
2500155 2503818 I'll say one thing, the war makes<br />the most peculiar widows.
2504093 2505253 I wish you'd go away.
2505327 2508524 If you had any raising you'd know<br />I never want to see you again.
2511400 2512867 Now, why be silly?
2512935 2517099 You've no reason for hating me.<br />I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
2518807 2522538 I guess I'd be very unpatriotic<br />to hate one of the great heroes of the war.
2522611 2526240 I do declare I was surprised to see<br />you turn out to be such a noble character.
2526315 2529807 I can't bear to take advantage<br />of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.
2529885 2531944 I'm neither noble nor heroic.
2532254 2533482 But you are a blockade-runner.
2533555 2535614 For profit, and profit only.
2536091 2538059 Are you telling me<br />you don't believe in the cause?
2538127 2540561 I believe in Rhett Butler.<br />He's the only cause I know.
2540829 2542694 The rest doesn't mean much to me.
2545768 2547736 And now, ladies and gentlemen...
2547836 2550805 ...l have a startling surprise<br />for the benefit of the hospital.
2552574 2556704 Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening<br />reel with the lady of your choice...
2557012 2558741 ...you must bid for her.
2560249 2563309 Caroline Meade, how can you permit<br />your husband to conduct this...
2563385 2565012 ...this slave auction?
2565087 2567647 Dolly Merriwether,<br />how dare you criticize me!
2568023 2569650 Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...
2569758 2572556 ...that if it's for the benefit of the cause,<br />it's quite all right.
2572628 2573890 She did!
2573962 2576988 Oh dear, oh dear.<br />Where are my smelling salts?
2577366 2578526 I think I shall faint.
2578667 2580999 Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.
2581203 2583797 If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
2585040 2587838 Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?<br />Make your offers.
2588777 2590438 Don't be bashful, gentlemen.
2591246 2595148 Twenty dollars,<br />$20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.
2595284 2597479 Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing.
2597553 2599680 Only $25 to give your--
2599822 2601881 One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
2602424 2603618 For what lady, sir?
2603725 2605693 For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2608597 2609689 For whom, sir?
2610065 2611623 Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2611834 2613995 Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,<br />Captain Butler...
2614103 2616867 ...but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles<br />would be proud to--
2616939 2620397 Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2621210 2623405 She will not consider it, sir.
2623645 2624976 Oh yes, I will.
2637226 2640457 Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.
2641530 2643555 We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.
2643632 2645395 It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?
2645634 2646658 It's worse.
2646802 2648793 But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
2648871 2650634 I don't care what you expect<br />or what they think.
2650706 2652196 I'm going to dance and dance.
2652274 2655300 Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing<br />with Abe Lincoln himself.
2687142 2689736 Another dance and my reputation<br />will be lost forever.
2689811 2692006 With enough courage,<br />you can do without a reputation.
2692080 2694105 Oh, you do talk scandalous.
2702157 2704421 You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
2704660 2708460 Don't start flirting with me.<br />I'm not one of your plantation beaux.
2708597 2710827 I want more than flirting from you.
2711366 2712663 What do you want?
2713435 2717804 I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take<br />that Southern belle simper off your face.
2718674 2720198 Some day I want you to say to me...
2720275 2723108 ...the words I heard you say<br />to Ashley Wilkes:
2723478 2724638 "l love you."
2725180 2729412 That's something you'll never hear from<br />me, Captain Butler, as long as you live.
2749371 2751703 How sweet, how kind.
2752274 2754242 He is a thoughtful gentleman.
2754309 2758040 Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say<br />something about my sacrifice?
2765954 2768047 Oh, the darling thing.
2768123 2770057 Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.
2770225 2773319 You didn't really bring it all the way<br />from Paris just for me.
2773395 2776853 Yes, I thought it was about time<br />I got you out of that fake mourning.
2777566 2780296 Next trip I'll bring you some green silk<br />for a frock to match it.
2780369 2781393 Oh, Rhett.
2781536 2786803 It's my duty to our brave boys at the front<br />to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
2787376 2790470 Oh, it's so long<br />since I've had anything new.
2800656 2801987 How do I look?
2802924 2804551 Awful! Just awful.
2805227 2806489 Why, what's the matter?
2806561 2807789 This war has stopped being a joke...
2807863 2811128 ...when a girl like you doesn't know how<br />to wear the latest fashion.
2816471 2818962 Oh, Rhett, let me do it.
2824379 2827439 But, Rhett, I don't know how I dare wear it.
2828350 2829749 You will though.
2830319 2832810 And another thing, those pantalettes.
2832988 2835752 I don't know a woman in Paris<br />that wears pantalettes anymore.
2835824 2837086 Oh, what do they...?
2837492 2839619 You shouldn't talk about such things.
2839695 2840684 You little hypocrite.
2840762 2843424 You don't mind my knowing about them,<br />just my talking.
2843498 2847195 But, I really can't go on accepting gifts<br />from you, though you are awfully kind.
2847269 2849237 I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.
2849371 2853137 I never give anything without expecting<br />something in return. I always get paid.
2853208 2855608 If you think I'll marry you to pay<br />for the bonnet, I won't.
2855677 2858271 Don't flatter yourself.<br />I'm not a marrying man.
2859014 2861710 Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
2871993 2873756 Open your eyes and look at me.
2875197 2877131 No, I don't think I will kiss you...
2877199 2878894 ...although you need kissing badly.
2878967 2880298 That's what's wrong with you.
2880369 2883304 You should be kissed and often.<br />And by someone who knows how.
2883372 2886034 Oh, and I suppose you think<br />you're the proper person.
2886108 2888906 I might be, if the right moment ever came.
2889411 2892107 You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,<br />Rhett Butler.
2892180 2894910 And I don't know why<br />I let you come and see me.
2895250 2896877 I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
2896952 2899147 Because I'm the only man over 16<br />and under 60...
2899221 2901519 ...who's around to show you a good time.
2901590 2904150 But cheer up,<br />the war can't last much longer.
2904292 2906021 Oh really, Rhett? Why?
2906094 2909188 There's a battle going on right now<br />that ought to pretty well fix things...
2909264 2910253 ...one way or the other.
2910332 2912425 Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
2914136 2917435 You still haven't gotten the wooden-headed<br />Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
2917506 2918837 Yes, I suppose he's in it.
2918907 2920898 Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?
2921209 2924372 Some little town in Pennsylvania<br />called Gettysburg.
3005827 3006919 Here you is, Miss Melanie.
3006995 3009691 They was fightin' for them<br />so it just got tore in half.
3009965 3012763 Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end.
3016671 3020038 Wellman, Wendell, White,<br />Whitner, Wilkins...
3020709 3021903 ...Williams, Woolsey, Workman.
3021977 3024241 Scarlett, you've passed him.
3024846 3026677 Oh, he isn't there!
3026748 3027715 He isn't there!
3027782 3030012 Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.
3030085 3032246 Oh, he's safe, he's safe.
3034089 3038082 Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet<br />to worry about Ashley like this for me.
3045534 3046967 I must go to her.
3048570 3050401 Don't, my dear, not here.
3051373 3052635 Let's go home.
3054009 3055704 Dr. Meade, not....
3055777 3058439 Yes, our boy, Darcy.
3059214 3061910 I was making these mittens for him.
3062517 3064348 He won't need them now.
3065387 3069255 Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show 'em.<br />I'll kill all those Yankees.
3069357 3070756 Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.
3070825 3073055 Do you think it will help your mother<br />to have you off getting shot too?
3073128 3074959 I never heard of anything so silly.
3077699 3080827 It's a black day, Scarlett.<br />You haven't had bad news, have you?
3080969 3082163 Ashley's safe.
3082404 3084099 I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
3084172 3085662 But, Rhett, there are so many others.
3085740 3086638 Many of your friends?
3086708 3090439 Just about every family in the county.<br />The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.
3090512 3094209 Yes, look at them.<br />All these poor tragic people.
3095083 3098610 The South's sinking to its knees.<br />It'll never rise again.
3099387 3100718 The cause....
3101022 3104150 The cause of living in the past is dying<br />right in front of us.
3104326 3106294 I never heard you talk like that before.
3106361 3110525 I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.<br />And that's what all this is, sheer waste.
3112734 3114258 But don't you be downcast.
3114569 3118005 Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home<br />to the women who love him...
3118340 3119739 ...both of them.
3156478 3158002 Oh, you're here.
3161416 3164385 Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.
3164686 3166881 Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.
3167088 3169488 Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.
3173428 3175487 Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.
3176998 3178295 Scarlett, dear.
3180735 3184501 Well, is this any way to greet<br />a returning warrior?
3184839 3186363 Ashley, l....
3189678 3191373 Merry Christmas, Ashley.
3199988 3203788 Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br />We've got all your wives.
3204359 3206293 We've got all your little chicks.
3206461 3209589 You got nobody to worry your head<br />about leavin'.
3210131 3211189 Come on.
3211466 3215869 Now you just stand still so you can be<br />a Christmas gift for the white folks.
3215937 3217268 Now hold on.
3218006 3218995 Hold on!
3219708 3221767 Don't go gettin' so uppity...
3221943 3224343 ...even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.
3226815 3229147 Let's not talk about the war.<br />It's Christmas.
3229217 3232914 Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara<br />and all the times before the war.
3232987 3234477 Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?
3234556 3236990 Why did you say there wasn't enough,<br />Uncle Peter?
3237058 3240585 There's plenty. It's the very last<br />of my father's fine Madeira.
3240795 3244697 He got it from his uncle,<br />Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
3244933 3248334 ...who married his cousin,<br />Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...
3248570 3251971 ...who was his second cousin once removed<br />and a kin to the Wilkeses too.
3252240 3255641 I saved it to wish Ashley<br />a Merry Christmas.
3256311 3260008 But you mustn't drink it all at once<br />because it is the last.
3264853 3267617 I meant it, my dear.<br />It was a lovely Christmas gift.
3267889 3270153 Only generals have tunics like this,<br />nowadays.
3270325 3272088 I'm so happy you like it, dear.
3272160 3273821 Where did you get the cloth?
3274028 3276155 It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.
3276297 3280028 I nursed her son while he was in<br />the hospital, Ashley, before he died and....
3280769 3283397 Oh, you will take good care of it,<br />won't you?
3283705 3285798 You won't let it get torn.
3286241 3287230 Promise me.
3287308 3288468 You mustn't worry.
3288977 3292378 I'll bring it back to you<br />without any holes in it, I promise.
3295383 3296372 Good night, my dear.
3296451 3298316 Good night, Scarlett, darling.
3311966 3314196 Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,<br />for Mr. Ashley to leave?
3314269 3315998 Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
3316070 3319528 She isn't going to the depot with him?<br />She hasn't changed her mind?
3319607 3321302 No, ma'am. She's layin' down.
3321409 3325402 She's so upset Mist' Wilkes told her<br />she can't even come downstairs.
3331986 3332953 Ashley!
3337392 3339724 Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
3340295 3343628 Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you<br />as you are now...
3343865 3345628 ...not shivering at the depot.
3346167 3347361 All right.
3348036 3350869 Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.
3357879 3359847 Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.
3360748 3362477 Tie it on me, my dear.
3363751 3367619 While Melly was making your new tunic,<br />I made this to go with it.
3368022 3369284 You made it yourself?
3370325 3373158 Well, then I shall value it all the more.
3373528 3376588 You know there's nothing<br />I wouldn't do for you.
3377398 3379389 There's something you can do for me.
3379534 3380592 What is it?
3381002 3383061 Will you look after Melanie for me?
3384205 3387265 She's so frail and gentle<br />and she loves you so much.
3387742 3389107 You see, if I were killed and she--
3389177 3392806 Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.<br />Say a prayer quickly.
3393047 3394571 You say one for me.
3395617 3398984 We shall need all our prayers<br />now the end is coming.
3399287 3400254 The end?
3400321 3401788 The end of the war.
3402590 3404455 And the end of our world, Scarlett.
3405894 3408863 But, Ashley, you don't think<br />the Yankees are beating us?
3408930 3411626 Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...
3412800 3415166 ...and the snow in Virginia is deep.
3415904 3417371 When I see them...
3417805 3422139 ...and I see the Yankees coming<br />and coming, always more and more....
3425146 3427876 Well, when the end does come<br />I shall be far away.
3428850 3431341 It'll be a comfort to me to know<br />that she has you.
3432453 3434580 You will promise, won't you?
3437025 3438014 Yes.
3439427 3441156 Is that all, Ashley?
3442163 3444723 All except, goodbye.
3445400 3447334 Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.
3447402 3448528 -You must be brave--<br />-No....
3448603 3449900 You must.
3450505 3452496 How else can I bear going?
3453274 3456903 Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine<br />and strong and beautiful.
3458313 3460178 Not just your sweet face, my dear...
3461182 3462547 ...but you.
3465820 3468015 Oh, Ashley, kiss me.
3468823 3470484 Kiss me goodbye!
3477131 3478120 No, Scarlett.
3478199 3479791 Oh, Ashley, I love you.
3480368 3483269 I've always loved you.<br />I never loved anyone else.
3483571 3485937 I only married Charles just to hurt you.
3486107 3488473 Oh, Ashley. Tell me you love me.
3489510 3491978 I'll live on it the rest of my life.
3493848 3494974 Goodbye.
3514869 3517099 When the war is over, Ashley.
3517905 3519839 When the war is over.
3540028 3541791 And there's a place back home...
3542563 3545794 ...where a wild plum tree comes to flower<br />in the springtime.
3547101 3548728 Down by the creek, you know.
3549203 3550727 Yes, I know, I know.
3551672 3554971 When we were little,<br />my brother, Jeff, and I used to....
3555109 3558567 I told you about my brother, Jeff,<br />didn't l, ma'am?
3559047 3560344 I know I did.
3560748 3561874 He....
3562116 3564949 We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
3565453 3568752 Since Bull Run we haven't heard<br />anything and....
3569223 3571521 Please, we must have<br />your temperature now.
3571692 3574217 Just take this in your mouth<br />and not talk anymore.
3574429 3575862 Not just now.
3576230 3579028 Melanie, I'm so tired I've gotta go home.
3580168 3581829 Aren't you tired, Melanie?
3582370 3584998 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3585673 3587197 This might be...
3587442 3588466 ...Ashley.
3589210 3592077 And only strangers here to comfort him.
3592513 3594504 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3595683 3597378 They could all be...
3597885 3599147 ...Ashley.
3611399 3615335 I've been sittin' by this curb one solid hour<br />waitin' to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.
3615403 3618065 Go on, you trash,<br />don't you be pesterin' these ladies.
3618206 3619696 Don't talk to her, Melly.
3619774 3621935 It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?
3622210 3624735 My name's Belle Watlin'.<br />But that don't matter.
3625012 3627207 I expect you think<br />I've got no business here.
3627281 3629841 Hadn't you best tell me<br />what you want to see me about?
3629917 3633182 First time I come here, I says,<br />"Belle, you're a nurse."
3633387 3635480 But the ladies didn't want<br />my kind of nursin'.
3635556 3637649 Well, they was more than likely right.
3637725 3639488 Then I tried givin' 'em money.
3639627 3642095 My money wasn't good enough<br />for 'em, either.
3642230 3643561 Old pea-hens!
3644031 3646499 I know a gentleman<br />who says you're a human bein'.
3646767 3650362 If you are, which they ain't,<br />you'll take my money for the hospital.
3650438 3653669 What are you doing here?<br />Haven't you been told twice already?
3653741 3655732 This time I'm conversin' with Miss Wilkes.
3655810 3657801 You might as well take my money,<br />Miss Wilkes.
3657879 3659779 It's good money, even if it is mine.
3660081 3661673 I'm sure you're very generous.
3661749 3664877 No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate<br />like everybody else, that's all.
3664952 3666283 Of course you are.
3666554 3668818 There's some folks here<br />wouldn't feel that way.
3668890 3671415 But maybe they ain't<br />as good Christians as you.
3678699 3681429 Look, Mrs. Meade.<br />It's a great deal of money.
3681802 3683963 Ten, $20, $30, $50.
3684372 3686704 And it's not our paper money. It's gold.
3687275 3688970 Let me see that handkerchief.
3689343 3690469 "R. B."
3692947 3696144 And she's driving away<br />in Rhett Butler's carriage!
3697018 3700146 Oh, if I just wasn't a lady<br />what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
3735089 3737819 "The Lord is my Shepherd.<br />I shall not want.
3738092 3740720 "He maketh me to lie down<br />in green pastures.
3741028 3742222 "He leadeth....
3744565 3746192 "He restoreth my soul.
3746834 3750235 "He leadeth me in the paths<br />of righteousness for His name's sake.
3750938 3754169 "Yeah, though I walk through the valley<br />of the shadow of death...
3754542 3756169 "...l will fear no evil.
3756477 3757739 "For Thou art with me.
3758045 3760605 "Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."
3761649 3762638 Yankees!
3763217 3766152 The Yankees!<br />Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
3766387 3770949 They'll never get into Atlanta.<br />They'll never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.
3771959 3774189 Give me something for the pain.
3774629 3776221 Give me something for the pain!
3776364 3778594 Sorry, son, we haven't got anything<br />to give you.
3780568 3783128 These animules is drivin' me crazy!
3784672 3786663 What luck! You've got my jack...!
3786907 3789501 Give me an ace and I'll start another war!
3789577 3791238 I'll bid the moon!
3794982 3799146 That I'll never see you or Pa again.
3800288 3801812 This leg's got to come off, soldier.
3801889 3804221 No, no! Leave me alone!
3804425 3805551 I'm sorry, soldier.
3805626 3807423 We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.
3807495 3809053 Then we'll have to operate without it.
3809130 3810927 No, no! Leave me alone!
3811232 3813530 You can't do it. I won't let you do it to me!
3813601 3816536 Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off<br />immediately. It's gangrene.
3816604 3818731 No, no! Don't!
3819006 3821736 I haven't seen my family in three days.
3821809 3823606 I'm going home for half an hour.
3824078 3825636 Orderly! Give me a lift.
3829850 3831943 Nurse, you can free this bed.
3833020 3834453 Miss Scarlett!
3836257 3837918 Why, Frank Kennedy!
3837992 3840051 Miss Suellen, is she well?
3840394 3843557 When did they bring you in?<br />You all right? Are you badly hurt?
3843631 3846225 -But Miss Suellen, is she--<br />-She's all right, but l--
3846300 3848200 Dr. Wilson needs you<br />in the operating room.
3848269 3850635 He's going to take off that leg.<br />Better hurry.
3852540 3853973 I'll be back.
3855343 3857834 No, no, leave me alone!
3858346 3861110 No, no, I can't stand it!
3861515 3864143 No don't! Don't cut!
3864985 3866316 Don't cut!
3866821 3868618 Don't, don't!
3869023 3870149 Please!
3870491 3872322 Where's the nurse?
3876163 3877653 Mrs. Hamilton, Dr. Wilson's waiting.
3877732 3880132 Let him wait! I'm going home!<br />I've done enough.
3880201 3883693 I don't want any more men dying!<br />I don't want any more!
3944999 3946489 Big Sam!
3947234 3949202 Big Sam! Big Sam!
3950304 3952636 Almighty Moses, it's Miss Scarlett!
3952773 3953933 Big Sam!
3954575 3955564 Big Sam!
3955643 3959010 Sam, 'Lige, 'Postel, Prophet!<br />I'm so glad to see you!
3959280 3961908 Tell me about Tara, about my mother.<br />She didn't write me.
3961982 3964109 -She's gone and got sick, Miss Scarlett.<br />-Sick?
3964185 3966085 Just a little bit sick, that's all.
3966153 3969179 Your pa was wild when they wouldn't<br />let him fight 'cause of his broken knee.
3969256 3973215 He had fits when they took us field hands<br />to dig ditches for white soldiers to hide in.
3973294 3975387 But your ma says<br />the Confederacy needs us.
3975463 3976794 So we're gonna dig for the South.
3976864 3978024 Sam, was there a doctor?
3978098 3979292 Sorry, ma'am, we've got to march.
3979366 3982130 Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
3982203 3985798 Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.<br />If any of you get sick or hurt, let me know.
3985873 3987397 -Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br />-Goodbye.
3987475 3988965 -Goodbye.<br />-Goodbye.
4009363 4010523 Scarlett!
4010698 4011756 Scarlett!
4015202 4018262 Climb into this buggy.<br />This is no day for walking.
4018339 4019431 You'll get run over.
4019507 4020735 Oh, Rhett!
4021342 4023572 Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
4025145 4027010 Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
4030384 4032978 That's just another of General Sherman's<br />calling cards.
4033053 4034315 He'll be paying us a visit soon.
4034388 4037118 I've gotta get out of here<br />before the Yankees come!
4037291 4039054 And leave your work at the hospital?
4039126 4042892 Or have you had enough of death and lice<br />and men chopped up?
4043163 4045461 I suppose you weren't meant<br />for sick men, Scarlett.
4045533 4047558 Don't talk to me like that. I'm so scared.
4047635 4049398 I wish I could get out of here.
4049937 4051370 Let's get out of here together.
4051438 4054407 No use staying here and letting the South<br />come down around your ears.
4054475 4056943 There are too many nice places<br />to go and visit.
4057444 4059435 Mexico, London, Paris....
4059647 4061274 -With you?<br />-Yes, ma'am.
4061982 4065383 With a man who understands you<br />and admires you for just what you are.
4065452 4068546 I figure we belong together,<br />being the same sort.
4068856 4073293 I've been waiting for you to grow up and<br />get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.
4073561 4077190 Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have<br />a baby in another month or so.
4078198 4081634 It'll be hard loving a man<br />with a wife and baby clinging to him.
4084438 4088499 Well, here we are. Are you going with me,<br />or are you getting out?
4088776 4093611 I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler,<br />and I'll hate and despise you till I die.
4094448 4097110 Oh no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long.
4104692 4106216 Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
4106293 4109990 Folks is all goin' to Macon<br />and folks is runnin' away and runnin' away.
4110230 4113393 I can't bear it!<br />Those cannon balls right in my ears!
4113667 4115760 I faint every time I hear one!
4116837 4119101 Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk!
4119206 4120468 But, Aunt Pitty, you aren't leaving?
4120541 4122873 I may be a coward, but oh dear!
4123611 4125545 Yankees in Georgia!
4125913 4127141 How did they ever get in?
4127214 4129876 I'm going, too. Prissy, go pack my things.<br />Get them, quick!
4129950 4131645 Wait, Aunt Pitty, I won't take a minute.
4131719 4133448 Scarlett, do you really think you ought to?
4133520 4134612 Scarlett!
4134888 4137857 What is this?<br />You ain't planning on running away?
4137925 4141224 And don't you dare try to stop me.<br />I'm never going back to that hospital.
4141295 4144230 I've had enough of smelling death<br />and rot and death.
4144398 4147492 I'm going home. I want my mother.<br />My mother needs me.
4147735 4150431 Now you've got to listen to me.<br />You must stay here!
4150504 4153496 Without a chaperon, Dr. Meade?<br />It simply isn't done!
4153574 4156270 Good heavens, woman, this is war,<br />not a garden party!
4156343 4157935 You've got to stay. Melanie needs you.
4158012 4159036 Oh, bother Melanie.
4159113 4161547 She's ill already.<br />She shouldn't even be having a baby.
4161615 4162741 She may have a difficult time.
4162816 4164181 Well, can't we take her along?
4164318 4165615 Do you want her to take that chance?
4165686 4167415 Do you want her to be jounced<br />over rough roads...
4167488 4169251 ...and have her baby ahead of time,<br />in a buggy?
4169323 4171120 It isn't my baby! You take care of her!
4171191 4173216 Scarlett! We haven't enough doctors...
4173293 4175591 ...much less nurses<br />to look after a sick woman.
4175663 4177096 You've got to stay for Melanie.
4177164 4178096 What for?
4178165 4180099 I don't know anything about babies<br />being born!
4180167 4181725 I knows, I knows.
4181935 4184563 I knows how to do it.<br />I's done it lots and lots.
4184805 4187638 Let me, Doctor, let me. I can do everythin'.
4187875 4190867 -Good. Then I'll rely on you to help us.<br />-Yes, Doctor.
4190944 4193970 Ashley's fighting in the field,<br />fighting for the cause.
4194248 4196773 He may never come back. He may die.
4197451 4199976 Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.
4200754 4201743 Ashley.
4201822 4204347 If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
4204658 4206250 I promised Ashley...
4206527 4207459 ...something.
4207528 4209052 Then you'll stay?
4209463 4212489 Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.<br />Scarlett's staying.
4212633 4215830 Go on, Uncle Peter.<br />Oh dear, I don't know what to do.
4216103 4218333 It's like the end of the world.
4219339 4222467 Uncle Peter, my smelling salts.
4229650 4231948 Melanie, it's all your fault!
4232319 4234446 I hate you, I hate you!
4234521 4235783 And I hate your baby!
4236256 4238224 If only I hadn't promised Ashley!
4238659 4240684 If only I hadn't promised him!
4269957 4272357 Stop! Stop, please stop!
4272760 4274387 Is it true? Are the Yankees coming?
4274461 4276190 I'm afraid so, ma'am.<br />The Army's pullin' out.
4276263 4278458 Pulling out of Atlanta?<br />Leaving us to the Yankees?
4278532 4279897 Not leavin', ma'am, evacuatin'.
4279967 4283027 We've got to before Sherman cuts<br />the McDonough Road and catches us.
4283103 4286231 It can't be true! It can't be true!<br />What'll I do?
4286306 4289639 Better refugee south right quick, ma'am.<br />If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
4291111 4292100 Prissy!
4293347 4295178 Prissy, come here!
4295249 4298480 Go pack my things and Miss Melanie's too.<br />We're going to Tara right away.
4298552 4299541 The Yankees are coming!
4299620 4300814 Yes, ma'am.
4302422 4303446 Scarlett!
4303957 4304981 Scarlett!
4305692 4307751 Melly, we're going to....
4309863 4310830 Melly!
4313467 4316925 I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.
4319373 4321603 It began at daybreak.
4322142 4323370 But, but....
4324444 4326309 But the Yankees are coming.
4327714 4329011 Poor Scarlett.
4329750 4332878 You'd be at Tara now with your mother,<br />wouldn't you...
4333654 4335144 ...if it weren't for me?
4336156 4337987 Oh, Scarlett, darling...
4338325 4340225 ...you've been so good to me.
4340327 4342795 No sister could have been sweeter.
4345866 4348198 I've been lying here thinking...
4349036 4350731 ...if I should die...
4351872 4353897 ...will you take my baby?
4356043 4358068 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
4358412 4361347 Aren't things bad enough<br />without you talking about dying?
4361515 4364416 -I'll send for Dr. Meade right now.<br />-Not yet, Scarlett.
4364651 4367211 I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here<br />for hours, while...
4368322 4372224 -...while all those poor, wounded boys--<br />-Melly, Prissy!
4373427 4375418 Prissy! Prissy! Come here, quick!
4375896 4377363 Go get Dr. Meade! Run quick!
4377431 4379797 Yes, ma'am. The baby!
4380400 4383892 Well, don't stand there like a scared goat.<br />Run!
4385272 4389265 Hurry! I'll sell you South, I will!<br />I swear I will!
4391111 4392874 Where's that Prissy?
4395482 4397507 This room's like an oven already...
4397851 4399785 ...and it isn't noon yet.
4402623 4404420 Oh, don't worry, Melly.
4405025 4408688 Mother says it always seems<br />like the doctor'll never come.
4410063 4412293 If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
4419873 4421101 Oh, Melly.
4421808 4424402 You know what I heard<br />about Maybelle Merriwether?
4424478 4426673 You remember that funny-looking beau<br />of hers?
4426747 4429910 The one with a uniform<br />like ladies' red flannel underdrawers.
4430150 4433677 You don't have to keep on talking<br />for my sake, Scarlett.
4433921 4435889 I know how worried you are.
4449136 4452799 Oh, Melly, I'll just go and fetch you<br />some cooler water.
4454508 4455998 You're as slow as molasses in January.
4456076 4457373 And where's Dr. Meade?
4457577 4460011 -I ain't never seen him, Miss Scarlett.<br />-What?
4460080 4462446 No, ma'am. He ain't at the hospital.
4462516 4467385 A man, he told me the doctor's down<br />at the car shed with the wounded soldiers--
4467554 4469920 Well, why didn't you go after him?
4470190 4471384 Miss Scarlett.
4471558 4474459 I's scared to go down there to the car shed.
4474895 4478831 There's folks dyin' down there<br />and I's scared of dead folks.
4480968 4482560 Oh, you go sit by Miss Melly.
4482736 4485864 And don't you be upsetting her,<br />or I'll whip the hide off you!
4524444 4527038 -Have you seen Dr. Meade?<br />-One side, lady, please.
4530984 4532315 Dr. Meade!
4576963 4578294 Dr. Meade! At last!
4578832 4582029 Oh, thank heavens you're here.<br />I need every pair of hands.
4582202 4585262 Come, child! Wake up!<br />We've got work to do.
4585472 4588771 But Melly's having her baby.<br />You've got to come with me!
4589109 4591771 Are you crazy?<br />I can't leave these men for a baby!
4592045 4594878 They're dyin', hundreds of them!<br />Get some woman to help you.
4594948 4598042 But there isn't anybody.<br />And, Dr. Meade, she might die!
4598218 4599185 Die!
4599252 4601982 Look at them!<br />Bleeding to death in front of my eyes!
4602255 4606453 No chloroform! No bandages!<br />Nothing! Nothing to even ease their pain!
4606893 4609054 Now run along and don't bother me.
4609329 4612457 Now don't worry, child.<br />There's nothing to bringing a baby.
4612799 4614198 Now bring those stretchers in here!
4614267 4615199 Dr. Meade!
4615268 4616826 Here. I'm coming.
4636089 4637647 Is the doctor come?
4638291 4639553 No, he can't come.
4639793 4642591 Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.
4642729 4645323 He can't come. There's nobody to come.
4646032 4649331 Prissy, you've got to manage<br />without the doctor. I'll help you.
4649636 4651433 Oh, lordy, Miss Scarlett.
4652639 4653765 Well, what is it?
4654007 4656271 Lordy, we've got to have a doctor.
4656343 4658470 I don't know nothin' about birthin' babies.
4660514 4662345 -What do you mean?<br />-I don't know--
4662415 4664178 You told me you knew everything about it.
4664251 4666378 I don't know how come I tell such a lie.
4666453 4670150 Ma ain't never let me 'round<br />when folks was havin' them.
4670357 4671449 Scarlett!
4672092 4673218 Scarlett!
4673927 4675724 Oh, Miss Scarlett....
4676396 4678159 Stop it!
4679132 4680599 Go light a fire in the stove!
4680667 4683636 Keep boiling water in the kettle,<br />get me a ball of twine and...
4683703 4686103 ...and all the clean towels you can find,<br />and the scissors.
4686173 4687868 Don't come telling me you can't find them.
4687941 4690102 Go get them, and get them quick!
4691545 4692603 Scarlett!
4702055 4703386 Coming, Melly.
4704491 4705549 Coming.
4709529 4711827 Go, Scarlett, before the Yankees get here.
4711898 4713889 I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.
4713967 4715662 It's no use. I'm going to die.
4715735 4718727 Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me.<br />Hold on to me.
4719005 4721200 Talk to me, Scarlett.
4721274 4723401 Please talk to me.
4723643 4724871 Don't try to be brave, Melly.
4724945 4727209 Yell all you want to,<br />there's nobody to hear.
4727414 4731851 Ma says that if you puts a knife<br />under the bed it cuts the pain in two.
4737157 4738920 Cap'n Butler!
4739793 4741090 Cap'n Butler!
4742862 4743886 What do you want?
4743964 4744931 Cap'n Butler.
4744998 4747660 He's upstairs. Belle Watlin's givin' a party.
4749936 4751130 Thank you.
4753473 4755907 Cap'n Butler! Oh, Cap'n Butler!
4756142 4758201 What's all the rumpus about?
4758378 4761575 I's got a message for Cap'n Butler,<br />Miss Watlin'!
4761781 4764773 Cap'n Butler, you come out here<br />in the streets to me.
4766586 4767553 What is it, Prissy?
4767621 4770112 Miss Scarlett, she done sent me for you.
4770290 4773020 Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.
4773526 4776427 And a fine baby boy...
4776896 4779660 ...and Miss Scarlett and me, we brung him.
4779866 4781197 Do you mean to tell me that Scarlett--
4781268 4785068 Well, it was mostly me, Cap'n Butler,<br />only Miss Scarlett...
4785138 4790007 ...she helped me a little, but I don't expect<br />no doctor could have done no better!
4790310 4794440 Only Miss Melly, she feelin' kinda poorly<br />now it's all over!
4795615 4796877 Yes, I can believe that!
4796950 4800545 And the Yankees is comin'<br />and Miss Scarlett she said....
4801855 4804585 Oh, Cap'n Butler, the Yankees is here!
4805258 4808523 Please come and bring your carriage<br />for us right away.
4808662 4811722 I'm sorry, Prissy, but the Army took<br />my horse and carriage.
4811931 4813865 You'd better come upstairs.<br />I'll see what I can do.
4813933 4815491 Oh, no, Cap'n Butler!
4815769 4820570 My ma would wear me out with a cornstalk<br />if I was to go into Miss Watlin's.
4821675 4825304 Any of you beauties know where I can steal<br />a horse for a good cause?
4832218 4835051 -Whoa, Marse Robert.<br />-Is that you, Rhett?
4835322 4838553 -We's here, Miss Scarlett. We's here!<br />-Rhett, I knew you'd come.
4838625 4840422 Good evening. Nice weather we're having.
4840493 4841790 Prissy tells me you're planning<br />on taking a trip.
4841861 4844352 If you make any jokes now I'll kill you!
4844664 4845756 Don't tell me you're frightened.
4845832 4849427 I'm scared to death. If you had the sense<br />of a goat, you'd be scared too.
4850103 4851195 Oh, the Yankees.
4851271 4852238 No, not yet.
4852305 4854637 That's what's left of our Army,<br />blowing up the ammunition...
4854708 4855766 ...so the Yankees won't get it.
4855842 4857867 We've got to get out of here.
4857944 4858933 At your service, Madam.
4859012 4860502 Just where are you figuring on going?
4860580 4861604 Home, to Tara.
4861681 4864275 Don't you know that they've been fighting<br />all day around Tara?
4864351 4866251 Do you think you can parade through<br />the Yankee Army...
4866319 4869049 ...with a sick woman,<br />a baby and a simple-minded darky...
4869122 4870783 ...or do you intend leaving them behind?
4870857 4873018 They're going with me and I'm going home<br />and you can't stop me!
4873093 4877086 Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing<br />Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?
4877163 4878596 I want my mother!
4879699 4881826 I want to go home to Tara!
4881901 4883459 Tara's probably been burned to the ground.
4883536 4885163 The woods are full of stragglers<br />from both armies.
4885238 4887365 The least they'll do is take the horse<br />away from you...
4887440 4888839 ...and even though it isn't<br />much of an animal...
4888908 4890341 ...l did have a lot of trouble stealing it.
4890410 4893846 I'm going home if I have to walk<br />every step of the way.
4893913 4897110 I'll kill you if you try to stop me.<br />I will, I will!
4897617 4898709 I will!
4904524 4908051 All right, darling, all right.<br />Now you shall go home.
4909929 4913387 I guess anybody who did what you've done<br />today can take care of Sherman.
4915001 4917333 Here, now. Stop crying.
4919839 4922137 Now blow your nose like a good little girl.
4922409 4923398 There.
4935288 4936380 Prissy! What are you doing?
4936456 4937889 I's packin', Miss Scarlett.
4937957 4939424 Stop it and come get the baby.
4939626 4940615 Yes, ma'am.
4943263 4944389 Melly!
4945398 4948231 Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.
4948635 4949533 Tara....
4949602 4951467 -It's the only way, Melly.<br />-No.
4951538 4954268 Sherman will burn the house<br />over our heads if we stay.
4954541 4955974 It's all right, Melly.
4956042 4957600 My baby.
4958211 4959735 My poor baby.
4964417 4966510 Have you the strength to put your arms<br />around my neck?
4966586 4968349 I think so.
4971357 4972483 Never mind.
4972692 4975058 Oh, Ashley, Charles....
4975128 4976720 What is it? What does she want?
4976796 4979560 Ashley's picture, Charles' sword.<br />She wants us to bring them.
4979632 4980599 Get them.
4996683 4997741 What's that?
4998318 5001549 Our gallant lads must have set fire<br />to the warehouses near the depot.
5001621 5004215 There's enough ammunition in the box cars<br />to blow us to Tara.
5004290 5006019 We'll have to hurry to get<br />across the tracks.
5006092 5007957 -You're not going that way!<br />-We have to.
5008027 5011190 The McDonough Road's the only one<br />the Yankees haven't cut yet.
5020540 5022974 Oh, wait. I forgot to lock the front door.
5023109 5024406 What are you laughing at?
5024477 5026604 At you, locking the Yankees out.
5043663 5045290 Oh, dear, I wish they'd hurry.
5045365 5048095 I wouldn't be in such a hurry<br />to see them go if I were you.
5048167 5050635 With them goes the last semblance<br />of law and order.
5053006 5055167 The scavengers aren't wasting any time.
5059646 5061375 We've got to get out of here, fast.
5061447 5062675 There's a horse!
5074160 5075821 Down the alley, cut them off.
5089809 5091504 Give me that horse.
5101688 5102677 Miss Scarlett!
5107627 5109561 They haven't left much for the Yankees<br />to take, have they?
5109629 5112928 We'll have to make a dash for it<br />before the fire reaches that ammunition.
5134487 5135476 Come on!
5139959 5141620 Throw me your shawl.
5144297 5147494 Sorry, but you'll like it better<br />if you don't see anything.
5207226 5209217 Take a good look, my dear.
5209662 5210686 It's a historic moment.
5210763 5214756 You can tell your grandchildren how you<br />watched the old South disappear one night.
5231884 5234216 They were going to lick the Yankees<br />in a month.
5234353 5236150 The poor gallant fools!
5236255 5237620 They make me sick, all of them!
5237690 5240818 Getting us all into this<br />with their swaggering and boasting.
5241160 5244493 That's the way I felt once<br />about their swaggering and boasting.
5245364 5247730 Rhett, I'm so glad you aren't<br />with the Army.
5247800 5252203 You can be proud, now, proud that you've<br />been smarter than all of them.
5254474 5255941 I'm not so proud.
5275394 5276452 Why did you stop?
5276529 5279259 This is the turn to Tara.<br />Let the horse breathe a bit.
5279632 5280621 Mrs. Wilkes.
5280733 5284032 Miss Melly done fainted way back,<br />Cap'n Butler.
5284237 5285795 Well, she's probably better off.
5285872 5288932 She couldn't stand the pain<br />if she were conscious.
5289442 5292309 Scarlett, are you still determined to do<br />this crazy thing?
5292378 5295211 Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.<br />I'm sure we can.
5295281 5297112 Not we, my dear, you.
5297483 5298950 I'm leaving you here.
5299252 5301846 You're what? Rhett, where are you going?
5302088 5304318 I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.
5304524 5307152 You're joking!<br />I could kill you for scaring me so!
5307226 5308818 I'm very serious, Scarlett.
5309028 5311519 I'm going to join up<br />with our brave lads in gray.
5311831 5312957 But they're running away!
5313032 5316490 No. They'll turn and make a last stand,<br />if I know anything about them.
5316569 5319231 When they do, I'll be with them.<br />A little late, but "Better late--"
5319305 5321034 Rhett, you must be joking!
5322441 5323999 Selfish to the end, aren't you?
5324177 5327806 Thinking only of your own precious hide,<br />with never a thought for the noble cause.
5327880 5329711 Rhett, how could you do this to me...
5329782 5332717 ...and why should you go now,<br />after it's all over and I need you?
5332785 5333809 Why? Why?
5333886 5334853 Why?
5334921 5337481 Maybe it's because I've always had<br />a weakness for lost causes...
5337557 5339115 ...once they're really lost.
5339392 5340484 Or maybe...
5341727 5343752 ...maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
5344997 5345986 Who knows?
5346065 5348932 You should die of shame<br />to leave me here alone and helpless!
5349235 5350293 You helpless?
5351771 5354535 Heaven help the Yankees<br />if they capture you!
5355074 5358134 Now, climb down here.<br />I want to say goodbye.
5358477 5359466 No!
5360079 5361137 Climb down.
5364817 5367980 Oh, Rhett, please don't go.<br />You can't leave me, please.
5368221 5369950 I'll never forgive you!
5370022 5373822 I'm not asking you to forgive me.<br />I'll never understand or forgive myself.
5374126 5378563 And if a bullet gets me, so help me,<br />I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
5378798 5380698 But there's one thing I do know...
5380766 5382427 ...and that is that I love you, Scarlett.
5382501 5385493 In spite of you and me and the whole<br />silly world going to pieces around us...
5385571 5386799 ...l love you...
5386906 5389431 ...because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.
5389842 5391309 Selfish and shrewd...
5392144 5395204 ...but able to look things in the eyes<br />and call them by their right names.
5395281 5397181 Don't hold me like that!
5397416 5399247 Scarlett, look at me.
5400419 5402853 I love you more<br />than I've ever loved any woman.
5402989 5406220 And I've waited longer for you<br />than I've ever waited for any woman.
5406292 5407486 Let me alone!
5408861 5411227 Here's a soldier of the South<br />who loves you, Scarlett...
5411297 5412787 ...wants to feel your arms around him...
5412865 5415766 ...wants to carry the memory<br />of your kisses into battle with him.
5415835 5417359 Never mind about loving me.
5417603 5421369 You're a woman sending a soldier<br />to his death with a beautiful memory.
5421641 5423438 Scarlett, kiss me.
5424577 5425942 Kiss me, once.
5431284 5433752 You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!
5434053 5437386 They were right! Everybody was right!<br />You aren't a gentleman!
5440559 5442720 A minor point at such a moment.
5444597 5445689 Here.
5446332 5448630 If anyone lays a hand on that nag,<br />shoot him.
5448701 5450635 But don't make a mistake<br />and shoot the nag.
5450703 5454833 Oh, go on. I want you to go.<br />I hope a cannon ball lands slap on you.
5454907 5456431 I hope you're blown into a million pieces!
5456509 5459672 Never mind the rest.<br />I follow your general idea.
5459745 5461838 And when I'm dead on the altar<br />of my country...
5461914 5464246 ...l hope your conscience hurts you.
5464817 5466250 Goodbye, Scarlett.
5492278 5494872 Come on, you! We're going home.
5570623 5572614 Oh, my poor baby.
5574527 5575960 Don't worry, Melly.
5576262 5578321 Mother'll take care of him<br />when we get home.
5578397 5581195 Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.
5581434 5583231 We's got to have something to eat.
5583302 5584326 Oh, hush up!
5584904 5587896 We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.<br />We'll stop there.
5588741 5589730 Go on!
5657009 5660001 Ashley, I'm glad you're not here to see this.
5661313 5663008 The Yankees!
5663082 5665016 The dirty Yankees!
5679665 5682156 Prissy, come tie up this cow!
5682668 5685034 We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
5685104 5688164 We'll be home soon, and I's scared of cows.
5688774 5691800 Tear up your petticoat and tie her<br />on to the back of the wagon.
5692044 5695673 We need milk for the baby, and<br />we don't know what we'll find at home.
5704924 5706915 Melly! Melly, we're home!
5707126 5708150 We're at Tara!
5708227 5710092 Hurry! Move, you brute!
5711697 5714131 Miss Scarlett, he's dead!
5714433 5718699 I can't see the house! ls it there?<br />I can't see the house. Have they burned it?
5722608 5724235 Oh, it's all right.
5724310 5726642 It's all right! They haven't burned it!
5726979 5728310 It's still there!
5731984 5734544 Mother! Mother! Pa!
5737289 5738950 Mother! Mother! Pa!
5744797 5747732 Mother, let me in. It's me, Scarlett!
5752238 5753205 Pa!
5753973 5755440 Oh, Pa!
5756175 5757506 I'm home!
5759011 5760103 I'm home!
5763182 5764581 Katie.
5765351 5766875 Katie Scarlett.
5767853 5769650 Oh, darlin'.
5780833 5781800 Mammy!
5783102 5786538 -Mammy, I'm home.<br />-Honey, honey child!
5788340 5790433 Oh, Mammy, I'm so....
5792111 5793169 Where's Mother?
5794146 5795113 Why...
5795748 5799343 ...Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen,<br />they was sick with the typhoid.
5800085 5802918 They had it bad,<br />but they's doin' all right now.
5803255 5804722 Just weak like little kittens.
5804790 5806758 But where's Mother?
5808460 5809586 Well...
5810162 5815065 ...Miss Ellen, she went down to nurse<br />that Emmy Slattery, that white trash...
5815768 5817793 ...and she took down with it, too.
5820139 5822300 -And last night she....<br />-Mother!
5826178 5827406 Mother.
5895347 5896644 Miss Scarlett, honey.
5896882 5899612 If there's anythin' I can do, Miss Scarlett....
5900486 5902113 What did you do with Miss Melly?
5902187 5904519 Don't you worry your pretty head<br />'bout Miss Melly, child.
5904590 5907457 I done slapped her in bed already,<br />along with the baby.
5907659 5910127 You better put that cow I brought<br />into the barn, Pork.
5910195 5912493 There ain't no barn no more, Miss Scarlett.
5912598 5914532 The Yankees done burned it for firewood.
5914600 5916727 They used the house for their headquarters.
5916802 5918463 They camped all around the place.
5918537 5919765 Yankees in Tara!
5920072 5922870 Yes, ma'am, and they stole most everythin'<br />they didn't burn.
5923075 5927136 All the clothes and all the rugs<br />and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
5929481 5931346 I'm starving, Pork.<br />Get me something to eat.
5931417 5934614 There ain't nothin' to eat, honey.<br />They took it all.
5934953 5936511 All the chickens, everything?
5936655 5938282 They took them the first thing.
5938557 5941355 And what they didn't eat<br />they carried off across their saddles.
5941427 5944191 Don't tell me any more<br />about what they did!
5960078 5962069 What's this, Pa?
5962147 5963239 Whiskey?
5963715 5964977 Yes, daughter.
5968854 5970879 Here, Katie Scarlett, that's enough!
5971223 5974351 You're not knowing spirits,<br />you'll make yourself tipsy.
5974560 5976460 I hope it makes me drunk.
5976829 5978421 I'd like to be drunk.
5981567 5982556 Oh, Pa.
5986138 5987469 What are those papers?
5988941 5990067 Bonds.
5991844 5993471 They're all we've saved.
5993712 5995304 All we have left.
5995848 5997042 Bonds.
5997449 5999178 What kind of bonds, Pa?
6000252 6002812 Why, Confederate bonds,<br />of course, daughter.
6002988 6004319 Confederate bonds?
6004957 6006686 What good are they to anybody?
6007359 6010021 I'll not have you talking like that,<br />Katie Scarlett.
6010229 6014290 Oh, Pa, what are we going to do<br />with no money and nothing to eat?
6015767 6017325 We must ask your mother.
6018470 6019801 That's it!
6020239 6022469 We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
6023976 6025705 -Ask Mother?<br />-Yes.
6026612 6029172 Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.
6030282 6032045 Now don't be botherin' me.
6032251 6034014 Go out for a ride.
6034653 6035711 I'm busy.
6053906 6055464 Oh, Pa...
6056208 6057937 ...don't worry about anything.
6059111 6060510 Katie Scarlett's home.
6063382 6064610 You needn't worry.
6080232 6081199 Miss Scarlett.
6081266 6085202 What are we gonna to do with nothin'<br />to feed those sick folks and that child?
6086738 6088330 I don't know, Mammy.
6089174 6090300 I don't know.
6090375 6093310 We ain't got nothin' but radishes<br />in the garden.
6093512 6096447 Miss Scarlett,<br />Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...
6096648 6099014 ...they's fussin' to be sponged off.
6099818 6101251 Where are the other servants, Mammy?
6101320 6103914 Miss Scarlett, there's only<br />just me and Pork left.
6103989 6106253 The others went off to the war<br />or runned away.
6106325 6109556 I can't take care of that baby<br />and sick folks, too.
6110429 6112192 I's only got two hands.
6112631 6117000 Who's going to milk that cow,<br />Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.
6200018 6201781 As God is my witness....
6202587 6206023 As God is my witness,<br />they're not going to lick me.
6206324 6211193 I'm going to live through this, and when<br />it's all over, I'll never be hungry again.
6211563 6213224 No, nor any of my folks.
6214800 6217360 If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill.
6218670 6222538 As God is my witness,<br />I'll never be hungry again!
6655448 6657541 My back's near broken.
6660153 6661882 Look at my hands.
6662588 6665751 Mother said you could always tell a lady<br />by her hands.
6666225 6670161 I guess things like hands and ladies<br />don't matter so much anymore.
6671030 6674830 You rest, Sue, you're not well yet,<br />and I can pick cotton for both of us.
6675034 6678629 Scarlett's hateful, making us work<br />in the fields like--
6678738 6680467 Too bad about that.
6680940 6683807 Now get back to work.<br />I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.
6683876 6686470 What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!
6689916 6692851 Don't you ever dare say<br />you hate Tara again!
6693719 6696085 The same as hating Pa and Ma.
6703396 6706058 Katie Scarlett, there's something<br />I must speak to you about.
6706132 6707099 Yes, Pa, what is it?
6707166 6710795 I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.<br />I don't like the way you're treating them.
6710870 6714271 You must be firm with inferiors<br />but you must be gentle with them...
6714440 6715873 ...especially darkies.
6715942 6719810 Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them<br />to do anything I'm not doing myself.
6719879 6724213 Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it.<br />I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
6739432 6740956 What are you doing out of bed, Melly?
6741033 6744230 Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.<br />You are all working so hard.
6744303 6745998 I can't lie in bed doing nothing.
6746072 6748597 Go on back upstairs.<br />You're as weak as a newborn colt.
6748674 6749936 Please, Scarlett, let me.
6750009 6752136 Stop being noble.<br />I've got enough on my hands...
6752211 6755078 ...without you making yourself sick<br />so you'll never be any use.
6755348 6757873 Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
6813573 6816167 Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot!
6822481 6824415 You all alone, little lady?
6827253 6829619 You ain't very friendly, are you?
6832625 6835423 You got anything else<br />besides these earbobs?
6835494 6838019 You Yankees have been here before.
6838197 6840825 Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
6841867 6844335 What have you got hidden in your hand?
6879839 6881807 Scarlett, you killed him!
6882975 6884840 I'm glad you killed him!
6886012 6889413 Scarlett! Scarlett, what happened?<br />What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
6893819 6896947 Don't be scared, chickens.<br />Your sister was cleaning a revolver and...
6897023 6899491 ...it went off and nearly scared her<br />to death.
6899759 6902887 Oh, thank goodness.<br />Haven't we got enough to frighten us?
6903062 6905622 Tell Katie Scarlett<br />she must be more careful.
6908834 6911132 What a cool liar you are, Melly.
6911771 6914035 We've got to get him out of here<br />and bury him.
6914106 6915767 If the Yankees find him here, they'll....
6915841 6919277 I didn't see anyone else.<br />I think he must be a deserter.
6919345 6920972 But, even so, we've got to hide him.
6921047 6924813 They might hear about it,<br />and then they'd come and get you.
6927720 6930348 I could bury him in the arbor<br />where the ground is soft...
6930423 6932891 ...but how will I get him out of here?
6933592 6935150 We'll both take a leg and drag him.
6935227 6936990 You couldn't drag a cat.
6943803 6947136 Do you think it would be dishonest<br />if we went through his haversack?
6947206 6949367 I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
6949742 6952575 You take the haversack,<br />I'll search his pockets.
6964790 6965848 You look.
6966459 6968017 I'm feeling a little weak.
6968294 6970888 Melly, I think it's full of money!
6971731 6973323 Oh, Melly, look!
6973399 6974423 Look!
6975134 6976226 Ten, $20, $30, $40....
6976302 6978463 Don't stop to count it now.<br />We haven't got time.
6978704 6980934 Do you realize this means<br />we'll have something to eat?
6981006 6982837 Look in his other pockets.
6984944 6986377 Hurry, hurry!
6986579 6988945 -We've got to get him out of here.<br />-Here.
7002228 7004560 If he bleeds across the yard,<br />we can't hide it.
7005197 7008166 Give me your nightgown, Melly.<br />I'll wad it around his head.
7008234 7009826 Don't be silly. I won't look at you.
7009902 7012564 If I had a petticoat or pantalettes,<br />I'd use them.
7026819 7029117 Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
7030122 7032556 Now go back to bed.<br />You'll be dead if you don't.
7032725 7034886 I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him.
7035461 7037622 No, I'll clean it up.
7041000 7042763 Well, I guess I've done murder.
7044870 7046895 I won't think about that now.
7047373 7049500 I'll think about that tomorrow.
7058651 7059811 Katie Scarlett!
7061120 7062314 Katie Scarlett!
7062922 7064753 It's over! It's over!
7065825 7067690 It's all over! The war!
7067760 7069159 Lee surrendered!
7069361 7071693 -It's not possible.<br />-Oh, why did we ever fight?
7072031 7073794 Ashley will be coming home.
7074166 7075895 Yes, Ashley'll be coming home.
7076469 7078096 We'll plant more cotton.
7078170 7080297 Cotton ought to go sky-high next year!
7095821 7098790 "While we were marching through Georgia.
7099058 7100719 "Hurrah, hurrah!
7100793 7102454 "We bring the jubilee.
7102528 7104086 "Hurrah, hurrah!
7104163 7105858 "The flag that makes you free.
7106065 7109091 "So we sing the chorus<br />from Atlanta to the sea.
7109401 7112893 "While we were marching<br />through Georgia."
7113138 7115333 Get out of the road, rebel!<br />Get out of the way!
7115407 7117568 Have you room in your carriage<br />for a dyin' man?
7117643 7120339 I got no room for any Southern scum,<br />alive or dead.
7120412 7121606 Get out of the way!
7121881 7124213 I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.
7124483 7127111 Giddap! Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
7127253 7129551 Act like they won the war!
7129822 7132552 Now you come on and give me them pants,<br />Mist' Kennedy.
7132625 7133683 Come on.
7135961 7139419 You scrub yourself with that strong<br />lye soap before I scrubs you myself.
7139565 7142625 I'm gonna put these britches<br />in the boilin' pot.
7145337 7147771 The whole Confederate Army's got<br />the same trouble...
7147840 7149899 ...crawlin' clothes and dysentery.
7150809 7152709 It's humiliating how you treat Mr. Kennedy.
7152778 7156373 You'd be a sight more humiliated<br />if Mist' Kennedy's lice gets on you!
7158651 7159913 Come on, Beau.
7160085 7163816 We must leave this gentleman alone<br />because he's tired and he's hungry.
7164757 7167453 I don't mind, ma'am.<br />Good to see a youngster again.
7167693 7168955 Nice little fellow.
7169161 7172892 Another two years of war and we could<br />have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.
7173766 7175256 Were you in Cobb's Legion?
7175334 7176562 Yes, ma'am.
7176702 7179933 Why, then, you must know my husband,<br />Major Wilkes.
7180005 7181302 Oh, yes, ma'am.
7181540 7183804 He was captured at Spottsylvania, I think.
7184076 7185304 Captured!
7186178 7188112 Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't....
7188514 7190709 Oh, my poor Ashley! ln a Yankee prison!
7191250 7192478 Melanie!
7192651 7195449 Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.<br />Come along, Beau.
7195688 7197747 I'll watch out for him, ma'am.<br />We're good friends.
7197823 7199313 Oh, thank you.
7203896 7207161 I slave day and night so we can have<br />food to keep body and soul together.
7207266 7209826 And you give it all away<br />to these starving scarecrows.
7209902 7211733 I'd rather a plague of locusts around here.
7211804 7213772 Don't scold me, Scarlett, please.
7213839 7216433 I've just heard<br />that Ashley was taken prisoner.
7216675 7218233 -Ashley, a prisoner!<br />-Yes.
7218444 7222642 And maybe if he's alive and well<br />he's on some Northern road right now.
7223082 7226245 And maybe some Northern woman<br />is giving him a share of her dinner...
7226318 7229378 ...and helping my beloved<br />to come back home to me.
7231323 7232449 I hope so, Melly.
7232558 7233547 Miss Scarlett.
7237429 7240626 Miss Scarlett, I wanted to take up<br />something with your pa but...
7240933 7241991 ...he doesn't seem to....
7242067 7244558 Perhaps I can help you.<br />I'm head of the house now.
7244770 7246431 Well, l, l....
7247006 7249634 Miss Scarlett, I was aimin' to ask<br />for Suellen.
7250743 7252973 Do you mean to tell me<br />you haven't asked for her...
7253045 7255240 ...after all these years<br />she's been counting on you?
7255314 7259080 Well, l, the truth is,<br />I'm so much older than she is, and....
7259218 7261345 Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.
7261487 7262681 Who has nowadays?
7263288 7266223 Miss Scarlett, if true love carries<br />any weight with you...
7266291 7268919 ...you can be sure your sister<br />will be rich in that.
7269261 7272560 I'll go out somewhere and get myself<br />a little business if we're engaged.
7272698 7274256 As soon as I get on my feet again--
7274333 7276733 All right, Frank.<br />I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
7276835 7278097 You go ask her now.
7279104 7281436 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
7284677 7286702 Excuse me, excuse me.
7289448 7292212 Scarlett, what seems to be<br />the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
7292484 7294418 More trouble than he guesses.
7294486 7296386 He has finally asked for Suellen's hand.
7296455 7297854 Oh, I'm so glad.
7298123 7302287 It's a pity he can't marry her now.<br />At least, there'd be one less mouth to feed.
7306165 7307689 Oh, another one.
7308267 7309598 I hope this one isn't hungry.
7309668 7310760 He'll be hungry.
7310836 7313464 I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate....
7325117 7326175 Ashley!
7328454 7329716 Ashley!
7331423 7332515 Darling!
7342801 7345497 Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.
7345571 7348335 Turn me loose, you fool!<br />Turn me loose, it's Ashley!
7348540 7350508 He's her husband, ain't he?
7363088 7365147 -Miss Scarlett, ma'am.<br />-High time you got back.
7365224 7367988 -Did you get the horse shod?<br />-Yes, sir. He shod all right.
7368227 7371822 Fine thing when a horse can get shoes<br />and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.
7371897 7373865 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
7374066 7377467 I gotta know how much money<br />have you got left, in gold.
7377703 7379398 Ten dollars. Why?
7380472 7381700 That won't be enough.
7381907 7383966 What in heaven's name are you<br />talking about?
7384042 7388274 Well, Miss Scarlett, I see'd that old,<br />no-count white-trash Wilkerson...
7388347 7390907 ...that used to be<br />Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
7391116 7394517 He's a regular Yankee now,<br />and he was makin' a brag...
7394787 7399724 ...that his carpetbagger friends done run<br />the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
7400125 7401615 But how much more have we got to pay?
7401693 7404856 I hear'd the tax man say $300.
7404930 7406261 Three hundred!
7407833 7409630 Might just as well be $3 million.
7410102 7411831 But we gotta raise it, that's all.
7411904 7412996 Yes, ma'am.
7413172 7414139 How?
7416542 7417770 I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
7417843 7420141 Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.
7420245 7422645 Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't l?
7425250 7426615 Askin' ain't gettin'.
7436094 7437288 Ashley!
7438630 7441190 They say Abe Lincoln got his start<br />splitting rails.
7442100 7444432 Just think what I may do<br />once I get the knack.
7445971 7448439 The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
7450242 7451834 What shall we do?
7452544 7454341 Ashley, what's to become of us?
7455147 7457809 What becomes of people<br />when their civilization breaks up?
7458817 7461786 Those who have brains and courage<br />come through all right.
7461887 7463411 Those that haven't are winnowed out.
7463488 7466787 For heaven's sake, Ashley,<br />don't stand there talking nonsense at me...
7466859 7468724 ...when it's us who are being<br />winnowed out.
7468794 7470193 You're right, Scarlett.
7470596 7473224 Here I am talking tommy-rot<br />about civilization...
7473765 7475494 ...when your Tara's in danger.
7476034 7478901 You've come to me for help,<br />and I've no help to give you.
7479471 7480768 Oh, Scarlett, l...
7481206 7482503 ...l'm a coward.
7483475 7485033 You, Ashley, a coward?
7486111 7487635 What are you afraid of?
7487980 7491472 Oh, mostly of life becoming<br />too real for me, I suppose.
7492651 7495017 Not that I mind splitting rails...
7495454 7499823 ...but I do mind very much losing<br />the beauty of that life I loved.
7501960 7506454 If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent<br />my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
7507065 7508965 But the war did come.
7509201 7511726 I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
7511937 7514371 I saw men crumple up in agony<br />when I shot them.
7515707 7519040 And now I find myself in a world<br />which for me is worse than death.
7520545 7522706 A world in which there's no place for me.
7525017 7528748 I can never make you understand because<br />you don't know the meaning of fear.
7528987 7531114 You never mind facing realities...
7532224 7535091 ...and you never want to escape<br />from them as I do.
7537729 7538753 Escape?
7540265 7542028 Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.
7542434 7544061 I do want to escape too.
7544703 7548799 I'm so very tired of it all.<br />I've struggled for food and for money.
7548874 7552901 I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton<br />until I can't stand it another minute.
7553345 7555836 I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.<br />It's dead.
7555914 7559611 The Yankees and the carpetbaggers<br />have got it and there's nothing left for us.
7562054 7563351 Oh, Ashley...
7564189 7565816 ...let's run away.
7565891 7567222 We'd go to Mexico.
7567292 7570352 They want officers in the Mexican Army.<br />We could be so happy there.
7570429 7574229 I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.<br />You know you don't love Melanie.
7574299 7576358 You told me you loved me<br />that day at Twelve Oaks.
7576435 7578369 And anyway, Melanie can't....
7579071 7582507 Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have<br />any more children and I could give you--
7582574 7584565 Can't we ever forget<br />that day at Twelve Oaks?
7584643 7587168 Do you think I could ever forget it?<br />Have you forgotten it?
7587245 7589577 Can you honestly say you don't love me?
7590983 7593349 -No. I don't love you.<br />-It's a lie!
7593518 7597579 Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie<br />and the baby, break Melanie's heart?
7597656 7599647 You couldn't leave<br />your father and the girls.
7599725 7602159 I could leave them. I'm sick of them.<br />I'm tired of them.
7602227 7605424 Yes, you're sick and tired.<br />That's why you're talking this way.
7607099 7609260 You've carried the load for all of us...
7609368 7612496 ...but from now on I'm going to be<br />more help to you, I promise.
7612738 7614831 There's only one way you can help me.
7614906 7616168 Take me away.
7616541 7618441 There's nothing to keep us here.
7619845 7620834 Nothing.
7622881 7624280 Nothing except honor.
7637229 7638696 Oh, please, Scarlett.
7639031 7641090 Please, dear, you mustn't cry.
7641466 7642490 You mustn't.
7642601 7644899 Please, my brave dear, you mustn't plead.
7658383 7660442 You do love me, you do love me.
7660719 7662778 -Say it, say it.<br />-Don't, don't.
7663055 7664454 You love me, you love me.
7664523 7667117 We won't do this, I tell you.<br />It won't happen again.
7667259 7669227 I'm going to take Melanie<br />and the baby, and go.
7669294 7670659 Say it, you love me.
7670729 7674221 All right, I'll say it.<br />I love your courage and your stubbornness.
7674433 7678199 So much that I could have forgotten<br />the best wife a man ever had.
7678270 7680738 But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.
7690382 7692373 Then there's nothing left for me.
7693819 7695878 Nothing to fight for.
7696721 7698655 Nothing to live for.
7701359 7702758 Yes, there is something.
7704262 7706321 Something you love better than me...
7707065 7708794 ...though you may not know it.
7714906 7715804 Tara!
7719811 7721369 Yes, l...
7723148 7724672 ...l still have this.
7729821 7731083 You needn't go.
7732023 7735515 I won't have you all starve simply<br />because I threw myself at your head.
7736962 7738429 It won't happen again.
7766758 7768817 -Why, it's Emmy Slattery.<br />-Yes, ma'am, it's me.
7768894 7769861 Stop!
7770629 7773530 You haven't forgotten your old overseer,<br />have you?
7774366 7776163 Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
7776334 7779167 Get off those steps, you trashy wench!<br />Get off this land!
7779671 7781195 You can't speak that way to my wife.
7781273 7783366 Wife! High time you made her your wife.
7783909 7786605 Who baptized your other brats<br />after you killed my mother?
7786678 7791547 We came out here to pay a friendly call<br />and talk a little business with old friends.
7791650 7794244 Friends! When were we ever friends<br />with the likes of you?
7794319 7797288 Still high and mighty, ain't you?<br />Well, I know all about you.
7797622 7799317 I know your father's turned idiot.
7799391 7800881 You can't pay your taxes.
7801159 7803525 And I come here<br />to offer to buy the place from you...
7803595 7805495 ...to make you a right good offer.
7805630 7806995 Emmy's had a hankerin' to live here.
7807065 7809158 Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.
7809367 7812234 You high-flyin' lrish will find out<br />who's runnin' things around here...
7812304 7813999 ...when you get sold out for taxes.
7814072 7817007 I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel<br />and I'll live in it.
7817075 7819100 But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
7819544 7821375 That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
7823248 7824681 You'll be sorry for that.
7833758 7834747 We'll be back!
7835126 7837390 I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.
7843168 7844328 Pa, come back!
7847806 7848898 Pa, come back!
7849140 7850107 Pa!
7851743 7853040 Yankee coward!
7861186 7861914 Pa!
7882707 7885801 Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.<br />That's Mr. Gerald's watch.
7886077 7888773 You take it. It's for you.<br />Pa'd want you to have it.
7889314 7892647 You ain't got no business partin'<br />from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.
7892717 7895880 You needs all your valuables<br />to sell for that tax money.
7896321 7898289 Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
7899991 7900980 And don't cry.
7902127 7904322 I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
7908667 7910362 Oh, Mammy, Mammy.
7916274 7920404 You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett,<br />you just gotta go on bein' brave.
7920879 7922813 Think about your pa like he used to be.
7922947 7924778 I can't think about Pa.
7925016 7927348 I can't think of anything but that $300.
7927452 7929352 Ain't no good thinkin' about that,<br />Miss Scarlett.
7929421 7931184 Ain't nobody got that much money.
7932223 7935283 Nobody but Yankees and scalawags got<br />that much money now.
7937962 7939020 Rhett!
7939097 7940689 Who that? A Yankee?
7946004 7948905 Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and...
7949774 7951435 ...l haven't any clothes.
7961586 7964384 Scoot up to the attic and get down<br />Ma's old box of dress patterns.
7964456 7966219 What you up to with Miss Ellen's portieres?
7966291 7967417 You'll make me a new dress.
7967492 7970017 Not with Miss Ellen's portieres.<br />Not while I got breath in me.
7970095 7972563 Great balls of fire!<br />They're my portieres now.
7973064 7976625 I'm going to Atlanta for that $300<br />and I've got to go looking like a queen.
7976735 7978896 -Who goin' to Atlanta with you?<br />-I'm going alone.
7978970 7981268 That's what you think.<br />I's goin' to Atlanta with you.
7981339 7982829 With you and that new dress.
7983074 7984132 Now, Mammy, darling.
7984209 7986177 No use to try to sweet-talk me,<br />Miss Scarlett.
7986244 7988906 I's knowed you since I put<br />the first pair of diapers on you.
7988980 7991813 I said I's goin' to Atlanta with you,<br />and goin' I is.
7992250 7995413 Kings and traes, huh?<br />Too good for me, Major!
7996221 7998655 Pity we couldn't have fought the war out<br />in a poker game.
7998723 8001749 You'd have done better than General Grant<br />with far less effort.
8001926 8002950 What is it, Corporal?
8003027 8006258 Sir, there's a lady to see Captain Butler.<br />Says she's his sister.
8006831 8007957 Another sister?
8008700 8011066 This is a jail, not a harem, Captain Butler.
8011136 8012967 No, Major, she ain't one of those.
8013037 8014971 This one's got her mammy with her.
8015740 8016900 She has?
8018009 8020534 I'd like to see this one, Major,<br />without her mammy.
8022781 8025545 Let's see, my losses for the afternoon<br />come to what?
8028052 8029644 Three hundred and forty.
8029721 8031780 My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?
8032657 8033885 All right, Corporal.
8033958 8036825 Show Captain Butler's sister to his cell.
8037695 8040186 Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen.
8045003 8048598 It's hard to be strict with a man<br />who loses money so pleasantly.
8050675 8053109 -Rhett!<br />-Scarlett!
8053445 8055538 My dear little sister.
8057115 8060607 It's all right, Corporal.<br />My sister has brought me no files or saws.
8066624 8067818 Can I really kiss you now?
8067892 8069792 On the forehead like a good brother.
8070094 8072790 No, thanks.<br />I'll wait and hope for better things.
8073598 8076590 Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed<br />when I heard you were in jail.
8076701 8078760 I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.
8079170 8080865 It's not true, they're going to hang you?
8080939 8082099 Would you be sorry?
8082207 8084300 -Oh, Rhett!<br />-Well, don't worry, yet.
8084709 8086142 They have plotted<br />some charge against me...
8086211 8087838 ...but they're really after my money.
8087912 8090244 They think I made off<br />with the Confederate Treasury.
8090315 8091373 Well, did you?
8091983 8093450 What a leading question.
8093618 8096109 But let's not talk<br />about sordid things like money.
8096187 8099213 How good of you to come and see me.<br />And how pretty you look.
8099491 8102517 Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,<br />teasing a country girl like me.
8102627 8105790 Thank heavens you're not in rags.<br />I'm tired of seeing women in rags.
8105864 8106888 Turn around.
8107532 8110433 Marvelous! You look good enough to eat.<br />And prosperous, too.
8110502 8112333 Thank you, I've been doing very well.
8112403 8114200 Everybody's doing well at Tara, only...
8114272 8117571 ...l got so bored I just thought<br />I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
8118109 8120634 You're a heartless creature.<br />But that's part of your charm.
8120712 8122976 You know you've got more charm<br />than the law allows.
8123047 8125607 Now I didn't come here<br />to talk silliness about me, Rhett.
8125683 8128777 I came because I was so miserable<br />at the thought of you in trouble.
8128853 8131720 I was mad at you the night you left me<br />on the road to Tara...
8131789 8133222 ...and I still haven't forgiven you.
8133291 8134952 Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.
8135059 8138756 Well, I must admit I might not be alive,<br />now, only for you.
8139130 8142861 And when I think of myself<br />with everything I could possibly hope for...
8142934 8146802 ...and not a care in the world,<br />and you here in this horrid jail...
8147305 8150274 ...and not even a human jail, Rhett,<br />a horse jail.
8151709 8154041 Oh, listen to me trying<br />to make jokes when...
8154345 8155903 ...when I really want to cry.
8156548 8157981 In a minute I shall cry.
8161619 8164452 Scarlett, can it be possible that....
8165156 8166714 Can what be possible, Rhett?
8167191 8170024 That you've grown a woman's heart,<br />a real woman's heart?
8170929 8173056 I have, Rhett. I know I have.
8175867 8178893 You know, it's worth being in jail<br />just to hear you say that.
8180972 8182269 It's well worth it.
8187211 8189679 You can drop the moonlight<br />and magnolias, Scarlett.
8189914 8192212 So things have been going well<br />at Tara, have they?
8192483 8193848 What have you done with your hands?
8193918 8196045 I went riding last week<br />without my gloves.
8196120 8199180 These don't belong to a lady.<br />You've worked with them like a field hand.
8199257 8200986 Why did you lie? What are you up to?
8201626 8203856 In another minute I'd have believed<br />you cared something.
8203928 8205020 But I do care.
8205096 8206495 Suppose we get down to the truth.
8206564 8210466 You want something from me badly enough<br />to put on quite a show in your velvets.
8210868 8212267 What is it? Money?
8213404 8215599 I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
8216274 8219004 I did lie to you<br />when I said everything was all right.
8219077 8223070 Things are just as bad as they possibly<br />could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.
8224215 8226080 What collateral are you offering?
8226184 8227708 -My earbobs.<br />-Not interested.
8227785 8229776 -A mortgage on Tara.<br />-What would I do with a farm?
8229854 8232379 You wouldn't lose.<br />I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.
8232457 8234550 Not good enough.<br />Have you nothing better?
8237428 8238952 You once said you loved me.
8239931 8241592 If you still love me, Rhett....
8242200 8244395 You haven't forgotten<br />that I'm not a marrying man.
8245470 8247597 No, I haven't forgotten.
8253444 8255105 You're not worth $300.
8255913 8258347 You'll never mean anything<br />but misery to any man.
8258916 8259905 Go on, insult me.
8259984 8262111 I don't care what you say,<br />only give me the money.
8262186 8265952 I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go<br />while there's a breath left in my body.
8266224 8267282 Oh, Rhett.
8267592 8269719 Won't you please give me the money?
8270094 8272255 I couldn't give you the money<br />if I wanted to.
8272330 8274423 My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.
8274499 8278094 If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd be<br />on me like a duck on a June bug.
8278503 8281370 So you see, my dear,<br />you've abased yourself to no purpose.
8284709 8286506 Here, here, here, stop it!
8287445 8289413 Want the Yankees to see you like this?
8289480 8291311 Take your hands off me, you skunk.
8291516 8293677 You knew what I was going to say<br />before I started.
8293751 8297016 You knew you wouldn't lend me the money<br />and yet you let me go on.
8297088 8298783 I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.
8298956 8302357 Cheer up. You can come to my hanging<br />and I'll remember you in my will.
8302427 8305294 I'll come to your hanging.<br />The only thing I'm afraid of...
8305363 8308457 ...is that they won't hang you in time<br />to pay the taxes on Tara.
8315073 8316404 Tell him Belle Watlin'.
8316808 8319641 Where you been lately?<br />Thought you deserted Captain Butler.
8319711 8321838 Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out.
8331456 8334892 Who that? I ain't never see'd hair<br />that color before in my life.
8335560 8337221 Does you know a dyed-hair woman?
8337295 8339957 I wish I did know that one.<br />She'd get my money for me.
8342567 8344558 No matter what they done to you<br />in that jail...
8344635 8346330 ...they didn't do no more<br />than you deserve...
8346404 8348463 ...for visitin' white trash in a jail!
8355546 8356570 Fresh and green.
8356647 8357807 Right off the farm.
8357882 8359907 Hey, what are you doin' tonight, Susy?
8360151 8361550 That's one of them Georgia peaches.
8361619 8363553 There's nothing like that in Ohio.
8363855 8366119 -You know what we're going to do?<br />-What?
8366524 8369550 We're going to give every last one of you<br />40 acres and a mule!
8369627 8372061 -And a mule?<br />-Forty acres and a mule!
8372330 8373297 Gee!
8373364 8374991 'Cause we're your friends...
8375199 8377030 ...and you're gonna become voters...
8377168 8379568 ...and you're gonna vote<br />like your friends do!
8381372 8382669 What's your hurry, sister?
8382740 8384139 What's come over this here town?
8384208 8387371 Yankees have come over it!<br />Same as they've come over all of us.
8389914 8391472 Out of our way, trash!
8392116 8393208 Get out of the way here.
8393284 8394444 Get away! Go on!
8403027 8404688 Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!
8404762 8406662 -Why Frank Kennedy!<br />-And Mammy!
8406731 8408562 It sure is good to see home folks.
8408766 8410290 I didn't know you were in Atlanta.
8410368 8411801 I didn't know you were.
8411869 8414030 Didn't Miss Suellen tell you<br />about my store?
8414405 8416703 Did she? I don't remember.<br />Have you a store?
8418476 8420740 Won't you come in, and look around a bit?
8429287 8431881 I don't suppose it looks like much<br />to a lady, but...
8431956 8433821 ...l can't help being proud of it.
8434492 8435789 You're not making money?
8435860 8439057 Well, I can't complain.<br />In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
8439564 8441623 Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
8442200 8445033 It won't be long now<br />before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
8445403 8446961 Are you doing as well as all that?
8447038 8448665 Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.
8448906 8450737 I'm no millionaire yet...
8450808 8453174 ...but I've cleared $1,000 already.
8453477 8454569 And lumber too.
8454645 8455737 Well...
8456447 8457744 ...that's only a sideline.
8457815 8459282 A sideline, Frank?
8459450 8463386 With all the good Georgia pine around<br />Atlanta and all this building going on?
8463454 8465945 Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...
8466958 8469051 ...and I've got to be thinking<br />about buying a home.
8469126 8470684 What do you want a home for?
8470761 8472854 For Miss Suellen and me<br />to set up housekeeping.
8473464 8476797 Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her<br />to Atlanta, wouldn't you?
8477668 8479693 There wouldn't be much help<br />in that for Tara.
8481005 8483599 I don't rightly know what you mean,<br />Miss Scarlett.
8484008 8485270 I don't mean a thing.
8485343 8488540 Frank, how'd you like to drive me out<br />to my Aunt Pitty's?
8489480 8491778 Nothing would give me<br />more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.
8491883 8493578 You'd better stay to supper, too.
8493651 8497018 I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable<br />and I'd like a good long visit with you.
8497121 8499749 Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,<br />Miss Scarlett.
8500992 8502983 And will you tell me all the news...
8503294 8505091 ...all the news of Miss Suellen?
8507899 8509491 What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?
8509800 8511324 Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
8511402 8512562 Oh, no, no.
8513104 8515038 I thought surely she had written you.
8515139 8516800 I guess she was ashamed to write you.
8516874 8518466 She should be ashamed.
8518542 8521102 Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.
8521245 8524408 You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
8525416 8528442 Well, she's going to marry<br />one of the county boys next month.
8529987 8533445 She just got tired of waiting<br />and was afraid she'd be an old maid and....
8533691 8535921 Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
8537094 8539790 Oh, it's colder. I left my muff at home.
8540031 8542898 Would you mind<br />if I put my hand in your pocket?
8559283 8561774 But, Melanie, you don't realize<br />what she's done.
8562420 8564411 She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.
8564889 8567016 He's my beau,<br />and she's gone and married him.
8567091 8569321 She did it to save Tara,<br />you must understand that.
8569393 8570655 I hate Tara!
8570728 8573993 And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing<br />I hate worse than Tara.
8578602 8579830 It's all my fault.
8581172 8584471 I should have committed highway robbery<br />to get that tax money for you.
8584542 8586908 I couldn't let you do<br />anything like that, and....
8587178 8588668 Well, anyway, it's done now.
8588746 8590145 Yes, it's done now.
8591215 8592910 You wouldn't let me<br />do anything dishonorable...
8592984 8595646 ...but you'd sell yourself in marriage<br />to a man you didn't love.
8596787 8600086 Well, at least you won't have to worry<br />about my helplessness anymore.
8601325 8602485 What do you mean?
8603603 8605036 I'm going to New York.
8606673 8608641 I've arranged to get a position<br />in a bank there.
8608709 8610040 But you can't do that.
8612145 8615342 I counted on you to help me start<br />a lumber business, Ashley...
8615415 8617440 ...and, well, I counted on you.
8617617 8618948 I wouldn't be any good to you.
8619019 8620680 I don't know anything<br />about the lumber business.
8620754 8622278 You know as much as you do<br />about banking.
8623423 8625482 And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.
8626393 8628156 That's generous of you, Scarlett.
8629362 8630624 But it isn't that.
8631098 8633259 If I go to Atlanta<br />and take help from you again...
8634301 8636701 ...l'd bury forever any hope<br />of standing alone.
8636870 8637962 Oh, is that all?
8638438 8642499 Well, you could gradually buy the business<br />and then it would be your own, and....
8643844 8645141 No, Scarlett.
8648749 8649773 Ashley....
8657791 8658758 Ashley.
8665966 8667024 Scarlett!
8668869 8670131 Scarlett, what is it?
8670304 8671896 Ashley's so mean and hateful.
8672906 8674100 What have you done?
8676677 8678406 She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
8678479 8682677 To help me start my lumber business, and<br />he won't lift a finger to help me, and he....
8682750 8684445 Why, how unchivalrous of you.
8684752 8686413 Why, think, Ashley, think.
8686954 8689752 If it hadn't been for Scarlett,<br />I'd have died in Atlanta.
8690224 8693022 And maybe we wouldn't have had<br />little Beau, and...
8693093 8696460 ...and when I think of her picking cotton<br />and plowing just to keep food...
8696530 8697827 ...in our mouths, I could just....
8698399 8699525 Oh, my darling.
8704505 8705733 All right, Melanie.
8706373 8707567 I'll go to Atlanta.
8709443 8710808 I can't fight you both.
8730631 8733259 Well, here's your new mill hands,<br />Mrs. Kennedy.
8733734 8735929 The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
8737104 8739265 They look pretty thin and weak to me,<br />Gallegher.
8739340 8739999 Halt!
8742976 8744466 They're the best you can lease, ma'am.
8744545 8747241 And if you'll just give Johnny Gallegher<br />a free hand...
8747448 8749575 ...you'll get what you want out of them.
8749850 8751579 All right, you're the foreman.
8752119 8755611 All I ask is, you keep the mill running<br />and deliver my lumber when I want it.
8755689 8757247 Johnny Gallegher's your man, Miss.
8757324 8758450 But remember...
8758692 8761252 ...no questions and no interference.
8761695 8764323 That's a bargain.<br />Start them in the morning, Gallegher.
8764398 8766332 Come on, get a move on!<br />Come on, move on there!
8766400 8768766 But, Scarlett, this isn't right<br />and you know it.
8769269 8771533 It's bad enough for a woman<br />to be in business, but--
8771605 8772833 What are you complaining about?
8772906 8775272 You wouldn't have owned a mill<br />had I not taken over.
8775342 8777936 I didn't want the mill,<br />and we couldn't have bought it...
8778011 8781310 ...if you hadn't pressed all of our friends<br />for the money they owed me.
8781382 8782371 Isn't that right, Ashley?
8782449 8784679 What are you running,<br />a charitable institution?
8784752 8787243 Go back to the store,<br />then go home and take your medicine.
8787321 8788379 You're not looking very well.
8788455 8790650 But, sugar, shouldn't you come home<br />with me?
8790724 8794091 Great balls of fire. Don't bother me<br />anymore, and don't call me sugar!
8794161 8795992 All right, all right.
8796530 8798020 Good night, Ashley.
8800100 8802625 She can get mad quicker<br />than any woman I ever saw.
8804438 8806565 Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...
8806640 8810098 ...l do wish you'd let me hire free darkies<br />instead of using convicts.
8810177 8811439 I believe we could do better.
8811512 8814606 Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,<br />and convicts are dirt cheap.
8814681 8816308 If we just give Gallegher a free hand--
8816383 8819819 A free hand! You know what that means.<br />He'll starve them and whip them.
8819887 8821855 Some of them are sick, underfed....
8821922 8823549 Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.
8823724 8826522 Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken<br />three times a day and...
8826593 8828686 ...tucking them to sleep<br />with eiderdown quilts.
8828762 8832755 Scarlett, I will not make money out<br />of the enforced labor and misery of others.
8832866 8834595 You weren't so particular<br />about owning slaves.
8834668 8837228 That was different.<br />We didn't treat them that way.
8837404 8839668 Besides, I'd have freed them all<br />when father died...
8839740 8841731 ...if the war hadn't already freed them.
8842042 8843339 Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
8843744 8846178 But have you forgotten<br />what it's like without money?
8846246 8849113 I found out that money is<br />the most important thing in the world...
8849183 8851617 ...and I don't intend ever to be<br />without it again.
8851685 8854620 I'll make enough so the Yankees can never<br />take Tara away from me.
8854688 8856053 I'll make it the only way I know how.
8856123 8858648 But we're not the only Southerners<br />who have suffered.
8858725 8862491 Look at all our friends. They're keeping<br />their honor and their kindness, too.
8862563 8866226 And they're starving. I've got no use<br />for fools who won't help themselves.
8866300 8868734 I know what they're saying about me,<br />and I don't care.
8868802 8870565 I'll make friends<br />with the Yankee carpetbaggers.
8870637 8873834 And I'll beat them at their own game,<br />and you'll beat them with me.
8876243 8878677 That's it. Move it a little over to that side.
8879613 8881046 Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
8881248 8882237 Good afternoon.
8882316 8883943 Business is certainly growing, ain't it?
8884017 8885041 It certainly is.
8886687 8889622 But you're doing business<br />with the same people who robbed us...
8889723 8892214 ...and tortured us and left us to starve.
8892359 8893519 All that's past, Melly.
8893594 8897086 And I intend to make the best of things,<br />even if they are Yankee things.
8899766 8903167 And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,<br />that Dr. Meade actually saw her...
8903237 8905432 ...peddling lumber<br />to those Yankees, herself.
8905672 8906696 And that isn't all....
8906773 8909640 I think it's shocking what she's doing<br />to my brother, Ashley.
8909710 8912235 She's even taken to driving her own buggy.
8920053 8921748 My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
8921822 8923551 My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.
8924124 8926149 I don't see how you have<br />the gall to face me.
8926226 8927853 When I think you could have had<br />my millions...
8927928 8929555 ...if you'd just waited a little while.
8929630 8931291 Oh, how fickle is woman!
8931765 8934165 What is it you want?<br />I have important things to do.
8934234 8938432 Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point<br />which has bothered me for some time?
8938505 8939733 Well, what is it? Be quick.
8940207 8943608 Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink<br />from marrying men you don't love?
8944578 8947479 How did you ever get out of jail?<br />Why didn't they hang you?
8948415 8949882 Oh, that! Not much trouble.
8949950 8951713 There's nothing much<br />that money won't buy.
8951785 8954583 I observe it's even bought you<br />the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
8955389 8957152 So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
8957724 8959555 Do you know,<br />I believe you're jealous of him.
8959626 8962424 You still think you're the belle<br />of the county, don't you?
8962496 8964555 That you're the cutest little trick<br />in shoe leather.
8964631 8966758 And that every man you meet<br />is dying of love for you.
8966833 8967891 Let me by!
8968635 8971297 Don't be angry, Scarlett.<br />Tell me, where are you going?
8971805 8973670 To the mill, if it's any of your business.
8973740 8975173 Through shantytown, alone?
8975242 8978700 Haven't you been told it's dangerous<br />to drive alone through all that riffraff?
8978779 8980110 Don't worry about me.
8980380 8983076 I can shoot straight<br />if I don't have to shoot too far.
8990757 8991724 What a woman!
9027160 9028718 Could ya gimme a quarter?
9028795 9030160 Let go of my horse!
9032466 9033660 Hold this horse!
9044645 9045703 Help!
9046246 9047645 Help!
9049249 9050341 Help!
9084584 9085881 Miss Scarlett!
9104938 9107429 Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!
9107874 9109398 Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!
9109476 9110500 Big Sam!
9110844 9112141 Miss Scarlett! Wait!
9114848 9116247 Sam! Sam!
9116717 9119242 Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br />Did they hurt you?
9120620 9124317 Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.<br />Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.
9125258 9126384 Horse, make tracks!
9130430 9132830 You get to Tara just as quick as you can,<br />and stay there.
9132899 9135390 I sure will.<br />I's got enough of them carpetbaggers.
9135669 9137830 Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br />Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
9137904 9139531 Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.
9139740 9143039 Scarlett, change your dress and go over<br />to Miss Melly's for the evening.
9143110 9144975 I've got to go to a political meeting.
9145045 9146205 A political meeting!
9146313 9147871 How can you go to a political meeting...
9147948 9149643 ...after what I've been through<br />this afternoon?
9149716 9152207 Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.
9152819 9156880 Nobody cares about me.<br />You all act as though it was nothing at all.
9178678 9181340 The men talk, talk, talk<br />about protecting our women...
9181648 9185482 ...and after what happened to me today<br />Frank has to go to a political meeting.
9189623 9192183 And if it won't pain you too much,<br />lndia Wilkes...
9192559 9195323 ...l'd be much obliged<br />if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.
9195395 9196862 Has my face gone green or something?
9196930 9197988 It won't pain me!
9198532 9201160 What happened this afternoon was<br />just what you deserved!
9201234 9203361 And if there was any justice,<br />you'd have gotten worse.
9203436 9204403 India, hush up!
9204471 9206735 Let her talk, Melanie.<br />She's always hated me!
9206807 9208331 Ever since I took your brother<br />away from her...
9208408 9210569 ...though she's too much of a hypocrite<br />to admit it!
9210644 9212043 If she thought anyone'd go for her...
9212112 9213670 ...she'd walk down the street naked!
9213747 9215305 I do hate you!
9216249 9219412 You've done all you could<br />to lower the prestige of decent people.
9219753 9222278 Now you've endangered the lives<br />of our men, because they--
9222355 9223322 India!
9223557 9227152 I don't think we'd better say any more,<br />or one of us will be saying too much.
9227427 9230089 What's going on around here<br />that I don't know about?
9235936 9237597 Somebody's comin' up the walk.
9237804 9239567 Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
9240440 9242874 Will you hand me the pistol, please,<br />Mrs. Meade?
9249382 9250542 Whoever it is...
9251785 9253082 ...we know nothing.
9256823 9257949 Where have they gone?
9258024 9260219 You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />It's life or death!
9260293 9262523 Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.
9262596 9264894 Quickly, please! There may still be time.
9264965 9266023 How did you know?
9266099 9267862 I've been playing poker<br />with two Yankee captains.
9267934 9269026 They knew there'd be trouble tonight.
9269102 9270865 They've sent their cavalry out<br />to be ready for it.
9270937 9273030 Your husband and his friends are<br />walking into a trap.
9273106 9275370 Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!
9278511 9281378 Out the Decatur Road.<br />The old Sullivan plantation.
9281815 9283510 The house is burned.<br />They're meeting in the cellar.
9283583 9284880 I'll do what I can.
9289789 9292690 What's all this about?<br />lf you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!
9293126 9294593 We thought it best not to tell you, Scarlett.
9294661 9297152 But Ashley and Frank and the others<br />have gone to clean out those woods...
9297230 9298697 ...where you were attacked.
9298899 9300526 It's what a great many<br />of our Southern gentlemen have had...
9300600 9302363 ...to do lately for our protection.
9302435 9305336 And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,<br />Scarlett!
9305739 9307138 And it will be your fault!
9307240 9309174 Another word,<br />and you go out of this house, lndia!
9309242 9311233 Scarlett did what she thought<br />she had to do.
9311311 9314075 And our men are doing<br />what they think they have to do.
9314848 9315940 Frank!
9316683 9317877 And Ashley!
9320253 9321550 Oh, it isn't possible!
9325425 9327916 There's horses, Miss Melly.<br />Here they come.
9328028 9329620 You're sewing, you're sewing.
9334534 9335831 Open the door, Mammy.
9346046 9347877 Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
9350317 9351875 Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?
9351952 9353044 I am Mrs. Wilkes.
9353887 9356321 I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,<br />if you please.
9356389 9357378 He's not here.
9357724 9358713 Are you sure?
9358792 9360692 Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.
9360994 9362825 I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
9363530 9366158 If you'll give me your word,<br />I won't search the house.
9366232 9370100 Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at<br />a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
9370170 9372798 He's not at the store,<br />and there's no meeting tonight!
9373106 9374437 No political meeting.
9374841 9377401 We'll wait outside<br />till he and his friends return.
9378945 9381880 Sergeant, surround the house.<br />Put a man on each door and window.
9381948 9383006 Yes, sir!
9387620 9389451 Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
9390357 9392655 And I'll read aloud.
9396162 9399256 "The Personal History and Experience<br />of David Copperfield.
9402335 9403461 "Chapter one.
9403903 9405029 "l'm born.
9409576 9413342 "To begin my life, with the beginning<br />of my life, I record that I was born.
9414280 9416840 "Chapter Nine.<br />I have a memorable birthday.
9416916 9418941 "l pass over all that happened at school...
9419019 9422216 "...until the anniversary of my birthday<br />came around in March.
9423423 9426017 "Except that Steerforth was more to be<br />admired than ever.
9426092 9427354 "l remember nothing.
9427427 9430521 "He was going away at the end<br />of the half year, if not sooner...
9430630 9433963 "...and was more spirited and independent<br />than before in my eyes...
9434401 9436835 "...and, therefore, more engaging<br />than before, but...
9436903 9438803 "...beyond this I remember nothing.
9439672 9440900 "The great...."
9443276 9444402 "l remember nothing."
9449449 9451144 Melly! They're drunk!
9451951 9453441 Leave this to me, Scarlett.
9453653 9455450 And, please, say nothing.
9458892 9460382 You stupid fool!
9462595 9463721 Quiet!
9464364 9466298 Will you shut up for the love of...?
9466833 9467822 Hello, Melly.
9468001 9471027 So, you've got my husband<br />intoxicated again, Captain Butler!
9471571 9472595 Well, bring him in.
9472672 9475038 I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />Your husband's under arrest.
9475108 9477167 If you arrest all the men<br />who get intoxicated...
9477243 9479108 ...you must have a good many Yankees<br />in jail.
9480080 9482742 Bring him in, Captain Butler.<br />If you can walk yourself.
9484851 9486182 I want to tell you a story....
9486252 9487617 Listen, Doctor, l....
9487954 9489216 Put him there in that chair.
9493326 9495692 And now, Captain Butler,<br />will you please leave my house...
9495762 9498356 ...and try to remember<br />not to come here again?
9498698 9501565 Well, now that's fine thanks I get<br />for bringing him home...
9501868 9504428 ...and not leaving him on the streets<br />in this shameful condition!
9504504 9506131 Now, boys, all together!
9506573 9508097 Dr. Meade...
9508708 9510573 ...l'm astonished at you!
9517350 9519580 Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?
9521421 9523184 I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
9524257 9526885 Take him into the bedroom<br />and lay him out on the bed as usual.
9526960 9528552 Don't touch him, he's under arrest!
9528628 9529617 Now, Tom.
9529729 9531526 What do you want to arrest him for?
9531865 9533526 I've seen him drunker.
9533766 9536360 I've seen you drunker!<br />And you've seen me....
9536436 9539371 He can lie in the gutter for all I care!<br />I'm not a policeman.
9540140 9541903 But he led a raid tonight<br />on that shantytown...
9541975 9544705 ...where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble<br />this afternoon.
9544844 9547870 A lot of those shanties were burned.<br />A couple of men were killed.
9547947 9551815 It's about time you rebels learned you can't<br />take the law into your own hands.
9552085 9553609 What are you laughing at?
9555321 9557846 This isn't your night<br />to teach that lesson, Tom.
9558224 9561091 These two have been<br />with me tonight. Yes, sir.
9561361 9562589 With you, Rhett?
9563663 9564652 Where?
9568735 9571169 I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
9571638 9572730 You'd better say.
9573373 9575534 Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
9575642 9576768 Speak out, Captain Butler!
9576843 9579539 I think I have a right to know<br />where my husband's been.
9581748 9585013 Well, ma'am, we dropped in<br />on a friend of mine...
9586286 9587617 ...and the captain's.
9588121 9589486 A Mrs. Belle Watling.
9590490 9593584 We played cards, drank champagne and...
9594594 9595652 ...well....
9595728 9599164 Now, you've done it! Did you have to<br />show me up in front of my wife?
9600767 9602632 Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.
9602802 9606135 These ladies won't be on speaking terms<br />with their husbands tomorrow.
9607574 9609599 Rhett, I had no idea, l....
9610944 9614471 Look here, will you take an oath<br />that they were with you tonight at...
9614914 9616040 ...at Belle's?
9616449 9619384 Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.<br />She'll tell you, Captain.
9619452 9621613 Will you give me your word<br />as a gentleman?
9622021 9623113 As a gentleman?
9623456 9624753 Why certainly, Tom.
9627427 9628724 Well, if l...
9628795 9630922 ...if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
9632031 9634397 I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I....
9636102 9638195 If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.
9638271 9640865 Well, I say I'm sorry, and...
9642008 9643635 ...well, I am sorry.
9643710 9645200 Come on, Sergeant.
9651684 9653709 Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
9655855 9656913 Ashley.
9657023 9659423 It's all right. It's only in the shoulder.
9659692 9661990 Get him on the bed<br />where I can dress the wound.
9662061 9663494 I think I can walk.
9664530 9666589 It's not worth the effort. Which way?
9666666 9667724 In here.
9669402 9671370 -Mammy, I want some hot water.<br />-Yes, sir.
9671437 9672904 -And lint for bandages.<br />-I'll find some.
9672972 9675941 Now what can I use for a probe?<br />lf I only had my bag.
9676009 9678671 Were you really there?<br />What did it look like?
9679312 9683339 Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br />plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
9683483 9685644 Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br />remember yourself.
9688354 9691551 And now, Captain Butler,<br />tell me what happened, all that happened.
9692091 9693456 I was too late.
9694093 9697620 When I got to the old Sullivan place there'd<br />already been a skirmish with the Yankees.
9697697 9700530 I found Mr. Wilkes wounded<br />and Dr. Meade was with him.
9700900 9704199 I had to prove they had been somewhere,<br />anyplace but where they were.
9705271 9706829 So I took them to Belle's.
9707006 9708234 And she took them in?
9708675 9710870 She's by way of being<br />an old friend of mine.
9711411 9713402 Oh, I'm sorry. I--
9713479 9716175 I'm sorry I couldn't think up<br />a more dignified alibi.
9720119 9723714 This isn't the first time you've come<br />between me and disaster, Captain Butler.
9723790 9726623 It isn't likely that I'd question<br />any device of yours.
9728828 9732093 And now, I'll go and see<br />what Dr. Meade needs.
9737804 9739169 Oh, Ashley!
9740973 9742065 Ashley!
9744110 9747602 Have you no interest in what's become<br />of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?
9750383 9752647 Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
9752885 9753977 No.
9754587 9755679 Well, where is he?
9756656 9758453 He's lying out on Decatur Road...
9759525 9760958 ...shot through the head.
9762161 9763253 He's dead.
9773539 9774597 Who is it?
9775074 9776234 It's Miss Watlin'.
9776442 9778876 Oh, Mrs. Watling!<br />Won't you come in the house?
9779379 9781506 Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.
9782582 9784607 You come in and sit a minute with me.
9792992 9795119 How can I thank you enough<br />for what you did for us?
9795194 9796957 How can any of us thank you enough?
9797029 9800157 I got your note sayin' you was goin'<br />to call on me and thank me.
9800233 9802667 Why, Miss Wilkes,<br />you must have lost your mind.
9803503 9805562 I come up here as soon<br />as it was dark to tell you...
9805638 9807902 ...you mustn't even think of any such thing.
9807974 9808998 Why, I'm....
9809909 9811001 Why, you're....
9811544 9813239 Well, it wouldn't be fittin' at all.
9813312 9817339 It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind<br />woman who saved my husband's life?
9817417 9821786 Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady<br />in this town nice to me like you was.
9822555 9825080 I mean, about the money<br />for the hospital, you know.
9825425 9827017 And I don't forget a kindness.
9827427 9830555 And I got to thinking about you being left<br />a widow with a little boy...
9830630 9832325 ...if Mr. Wilkes got hung...
9832965 9835763 ...and he's a nice little boy,<br />your boy is, Miss Wilkes.
9836602 9839127 I got a boy myself and so l....
9839739 9841832 Oh, you have? Does he live...?
9842008 9844272 Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.
9845478 9846911 He ain't never been here.
9847447 9849381 He's off at school.
9849849 9851874 I ain't seen him since he was little.
9854887 9858880 Well, anyway, if it had been<br />that Miss Kennedy's husband by hisself...
9859192 9862628 ...l wouldn't have lifted a finger to,<br />no matter what Captain Butler said.
9862695 9864629 She's a mighty cold woman.
9864697 9866858 Prancin' about Atlanta by herself.
9867300 9869632 She killed her husband<br />same as if she shot him.
9870269 9872931 You mustn't say unkind things<br />about my sister-in-law.
9876576 9878567 Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.
9878878 9880607 I forgot how you liked her.
9881848 9885875 But she just ain't in the same class<br />with you and I can't help it if I think so.
9886686 9888950 Well, anyway, I gotta be goin'.
9889989 9893755 I'm scared somebody'll recognize<br />this carriage if I stayed here any longer.
9893826 9895623 That wouldn't do you no good.
9896529 9897962 And Miss Wilkes...
9898498 9901729 ...if you ever see me on the street,<br />you don't have to speak to me.
9902502 9903799 I'll understand.
9904637 9908437 I should be proud to speak to you.<br />Proud to be under obligation to you.
9909775 9911140 I hope we meet again.
9911577 9913807 Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fittin'.
9916048 9918573 -Good night, Miss Wilkes.<br />-Good night, Mrs. Watling.
9924257 9926316 And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
9926425 9928723 She's brokenhearted about her husband.
9973005 9975269 Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.
10001500 10003798 Miss Scarlett, Captain Butler here<br />to see you.
10004070 10006197 I told him you was prostrate with grief.
10006305 10008933 Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
10039538 10040903 She says she's comin'.
10041340 10043740 I don't know why she's comin'.<br />But she's a-comin'.
10043809 10045299 You don't like me, Mammy.
10045378 10048609 Now don't you argue with me, you don't.<br />You really don't.
10060693 10062092 It's no good, Scarlett.
10062728 10063660 What?
10063729 10064787 The cologne.
10065264 10067425 I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
10067933 10071096 I mean you've been drinking.<br />Brandy. Quite a lot.
10072038 10074563 Well, what if I have?<br />ls that any of your affair?
10077176 10078803 Don't drink alone, Scarlett.
10079011 10081912 People always find out<br />and it ruins the reputation.
10088421 10089547 What is it?
10089622 10091590 This is more than losing old Frank.
10092058 10093423 Oh, Rhett...
10093492 10094550 ...l'm so afraid.
10094927 10097623 I don't believe it.<br />You've never been afraid in your life.
10097697 10099164 I'm afraid now.
10099432 10101525 I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
10103402 10106337 You look pretty healthy,<br />and maybe there isn't any hell.
10106405 10109602 Oh, there is. I know there is.<br />I was raised on it.
10110543 10113637 Well, far be it from me to question<br />the teachings of childhood.
10114246 10116942 Tell me what you've done<br />that hell yawns before you.
10118451 10120919 I ought never to have married Frank<br />to begin with.
10121253 10123721 He was Suellen's beau<br />and he loved her, not me.
10124623 10127353 And I made him miserable.<br />And I killed him.
10127893 10129827 Yes, I did! I killed him!
10133265 10137929 For the first time I'm finding out what it is<br />to be sorry for something I've done.
10138471 10140462 Here. Dry your eyes.
10141707 10144642 If you had it all to do over again,<br />you'd do no differently.
10144710 10147338 You're like the thief who isn't<br />the least bit sorry he stole...
10147413 10150246 ...but he's terribly, terribly sorry<br />he's going to jail.
10150483 10152451 I'm glad Mother's dead.
10153185 10155847 I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
10156856 10159620 I always wanted to be like her,<br />calm and kind and....
10160826 10163317 And I certainly have<br />turned out disappointing.
10165231 10168792 You know, Scarlett, I think you're<br />on the verge of a crying jag.
10176742 10179506 So I'll change the subject<br />and say what I came to say.
10180012 10181479 Say it, then, and get out!
10182915 10183904 What is it?
10183983 10186247 That I can't go on any longer without you.
10186919 10191049 You are the most ill-bred man to come here<br />at a time like this with your filthy--
10191123 10193614 I made up my mind that you were<br />the only woman for me...
10193692 10195592 ...the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.
10195661 10197925 Now that you've got the lumber mill<br />and Frank's money...
10197997 10200227 ...you won't come to me<br />as you did to the jail.
10200432 10202400 So I see I shall have to marry you.
10203269 10204930 I never heard of such bad taste.
10205004 10207370 Would you be more convinced<br />if I fell to my knees?
10207439 10209270 Turn me loose, you varmint,<br />and get out of here!
10209341 10212310 Forgive me for startling you<br />with the impetuosity of my sentiments...
10212378 10215040 ...my dear Scarlett.<br />I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
10215347 10218475 But it cannot have escaped your notice<br />that for some time past...
10218551 10221884 ...the friendship I have felt for you<br />has ripened into a deeper feeling.
10221954 10225355 A feeling more beautiful,<br />more pure, more sacred.
10226525 10228618 Dare I name it? Can it be love?
10229261 10231752 Get up off your knees.<br />I don't like your common jokes.
10231931 10233626 This is an honorable proposal of marriage...
10233699 10236224 ...made at what I consider<br />a most opportune moment.
10237369 10240338 I can't go all my life waiting<br />to catch you between husbands.
10240973 10243134 You're coarse, and you're conceited.
10244143 10246703 And I think this conversation<br />has gone far enough.
10247646 10250114 Besides, I shall never marry again.
10251183 10253651 Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.
10254220 10255949 You? You!
10256689 10258054 I don't love you!
10258557 10260821 And I don't like being married.
10261794 10264024 Did you ever think of marrying just for fun?
10264230 10267597 Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.<br />Fun for men, you mean.
10268834 10270529 Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?
10270603 10272798 You've been married to a boy<br />and an old man.
10273105 10276165 Why not try a husband of the right age,<br />with a way with women?
10277042 10281536 You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know<br />I shall always love another man.
10282882 10286147 Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?<br />Stop it! No more of that talk.
10292524 10293991 Rhett, don't, I shall faint.
10294059 10296721 I want you to faint.<br />This is what you were meant for.
10296962 10299726 None of the fools you've known<br />have kissed you like this, have they?
10299798 10302392 Your Charles, or your Frank,<br />or your stupid Ashley.
10310943 10314037 Say you're going to marry me.<br />Say "yes." Say "yes! "
10314280 10315304 Yes.
10317616 10320107 Are you sure you meant it?<br />You don't want to take it back?
10320185 10321209 No.
10321854 10323981 Look at me and try to tell me the truth.
10324556 10326547 Did you say "yes" because of my money?
10327159 10328148 Well....
10328394 10329827 Yes. Partly.
10331096 10332188 Partly?
10332898 10337631 Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,<br />and, of course I am fond of you.
10337803 10338827 Fond of me.
10338904 10342362 Well, if I said I was madly in love with you,<br />you'd know I was lying...
10342508 10344373 ...but you always said<br />we had a lot in common....
10344443 10345933 Yes, you're right, my dear.
10346445 10348777 I'm not in love with you any more<br />than you are with me.
10348847 10351111 Heaven help the man<br />who ever really loves you.
10351850 10353750 What kind of a ring would you like,<br />my darling?
10353819 10357016 Oh, a diamond ring.<br />And do buy a great big one, Rhett.
10357089 10360081 You shall have the biggest<br />and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
10360392 10362383 I'll take you to New Orleans<br />for the most expensive honeymoon...
10362494 10364018 ...my ill-gotten gains can buy.
10364096 10365586 Oh, that would be just heavenly.
10365831 10367856 And I think I'll buy your trousseau<br />for you, too.
10367967 10369559 Rhett, how wonderful, but...
10370336 10372497 ...you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?
10372972 10374439 Still the little hypocrite.
10377176 10379269 Rhett, aren't you going<br />to kiss me goodbye?
10379345 10382041 Don't you think you've had enough kissing<br />for one afternoon?
10382114 10383206 You're impossible.
10383282 10385682 You can go and I don't care<br />if you never come back.
10385751 10387082 But I will come back.
10402067 10404126 What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
10404236 10406101 I'm thinking about how rich we are.
10408107 10410439 Rhett, I can keep<br />the lumber business too, can't l?
10410509 10412704 Yes, of course, you can, if it amuses you.
10412978 10415606 Now that you're rich<br />you can tell everyone to go to the devil...
10415681 10417080 ...as you've always said you wanted to.
10417483 10420043 But you were the main one<br />I wanted to go to the devil.
10437870 10441328 Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.<br />I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
10441640 10445098 Oh, Rhett, can I have one of those<br />chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?
10445611 10448910 If you don't stop being such a glutton,<br />you'll get as fat as Mammy...
10449014 10450447 ...then I'll divorce you.
10451283 10454013 Wouldn't it be nice if you bought<br />something for Mammy, too?
10454086 10457078 Why should I buy her a present<br />when she called us both mules?
10457823 10459154 Mules? Why mules?
10459458 10463326 Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,<br />and get ourselves all slicked up...
10463395 10465625 ...like racehorses but we were just mules<br />in horse harness...
10465697 10467289 ...and we didn't fool anybody.
10468333 10470130 I never heard anything more true.
10470202 10471760 Mammy's a smart old soul...
10472071 10475370 ...and one of the few people I know<br />whose respect I'd like to have.
10476508 10478339 I won't give her a thing.<br />She doesn't deserve it.
10478410 10480139 Then I'll take her a petticoat.
10480245 10482440 My Mammy always said<br />when she went to heaven...
10482514 10486473 ...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,<br />so stiff that it would stand by itself...
10486752 10489778 ...and so rustly, the Lord would think<br />it was made of angels' wings.
10489855 10492915 Why, she won't take it from you.<br />She'd rather die than wear it.
10493092 10495856 That may be, but I'm making the gesture<br />just the same.
10500566 10502761 Wake up! Wake up!
10504536 10506436 You were having another nightmare.
10507739 10508763 Oh, Rhett.
10509174 10511369 When I was so cold and hungry and...
10511443 10512933 ...and so tired l...
10513545 10517504 ...l couldn't find it. I ran through the mist<br />and I couldn't find it.
10518350 10520341 -Find what, honey?<br />-Oh, I don't know.
10521120 10523645 I always dream the same dream<br />and I never know.
10524289 10526120 It seems to be hidden in the mist.
10526358 10527450 Darling.
10528760 10532890 Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream<br />that I've found it and that I'm safe?
10534233 10538329 Dreams don't work that way, but when<br />you get used to being safe and warm...
10538804 10540704 ...you'll stop dreaming that dream.
10541106 10544132 And, Scarlett, I'm going to see<br />that you are safe.
10548447 10550711 Would you do something<br />for me if I asked you?
10551183 10552377 You know I would.
10553619 10555917 Will you take me away from here?
10556255 10557722 Don't you like New Orleans?
10557789 10561316 Oh, I love New Orleans,<br />but I want to go home and visit Tara.
10562728 10564286 Will you take me to Tara?
10565097 10569591 Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.<br />We'll go tomorrow.
10573005 10575803 You get your strength<br />from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.
10575874 10577933 You're part of it, and it's part of you.
10578010 10581571 Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara<br />the way it was before the war.
10581813 10584714 Would you?<br />Then go ahead and make it that way.
10585250 10588549 Spend whatever you want,<br />make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
10589154 10590644 Oh, Rhett.
10591256 10592746 Rhett, you are good to me.
10593091 10595423 And can we still have<br />our big new house in Atlanta?
10595494 10598054 Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want...
10598530 10600896 ...marbled terraces, stained-glass windows<br />and all.
10600966 10602866 Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?
10602935 10606063 I want everybody who's been mean to me<br />to be pea-green with envy.
10607906 10612070 I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,<br />building that new house just to show off...
10612211 10614441 ...and even taking our servants.
10615414 10618315 Oh, darling, you mustn't think<br />unkindly of her.
10618784 10621378 She's made it possible for us<br />to keep Tara always.
10621887 10623479 Yes, and what good is Tara?
10623956 10627517 She's had three husbands<br />and I'll be an old maid.
10630529 10632360 Great Jehosophat!
10633165 10634860 Great Jehosophat!
10635267 10637292 Lordsy, we sure is rich now!
10637502 10638594 It ain't quality....
10639071 10641266 But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?
10642040 10644474 I'm entitled to at least see<br />what my own child looks like.
10644543 10648035 You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.<br />You'll be seein' it for a long time.
10648847 10651577 I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,<br />about it's not being a boy.
10651650 10653880 Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.<br />Who wants a boy?
10654186 10657383 Boys aren't any use to anybody.<br />Don't you think I'm proof of that?
10658156 10659987 Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.
10660058 10662583 Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
10662894 10664225 She sure is.
10665130 10666757 Did you ever see a prettier one?
10666832 10670768 Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh<br />that pretty when she come, but not quite.
10671203 10672636 Have another glass, Mammy.
10677309 10679402 What's that rustling noise I hear?
10679478 10683676 Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothin' but<br />my red silk petticoat you done give me.
10683782 10686876 Nothing but your petticoat.<br />I don't believe it. Let me see.
10686952 10688112 Pull up your skirt.
10688620 10690212 Mr. Rhett. You is bad.
10691256 10692348 Yeah, oh, Lord!
10698430 10700990 You sure took a long enough time<br />about wearing it.
10701667 10703294 Yes, sir, too long.
10704002 10705970 No more mule in horse's harness?
10706271 10709240 Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad<br />tellin' you about that.
10709574 10712134 You ain't holdin' that<br />against old Mammy, is you?
10712577 10715410 No, I ain't holding it against you.<br />I just wanted to know.
10715480 10718244 Have another glass, Mammy.<br />Here, take the whole bottle.
10718450 10720884 Dr. Meade says you may go in now,<br />Captain Butler.
10724790 10726724 This sure is a happy day to me.
10727025 10729858 I done diapered three generations<br />of this family's girls...
10730329 10732388 ...and it sure is a happy day.
10732564 10735931 Oh, yes, Mammy.<br />The happiest days are when babies come.
10736001 10737161 I wish....
10737736 10740899 Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.<br />What do you suppose they'll name her?
10741006 10743406 Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl...
10743508 10746568 ...she's goin' to name it Eugenia Victoria.
10747412 10748504 Yes...
10748714 10750648 ...she's a beautiful baby...
10751416 10753816 ...the most beautiful baby ever.
10754886 10756080 Yes.
10757622 10759954 Do you know that this is your birthday?
10760659 10762820 That you're a week old today?
10763462 10768627 Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes<br />of which this town has never seen.
10769334 10772462 Yes, I'm gonna send her<br />to the best schools in Charleston.
10772938 10777034 Yes. And her'll be received<br />by the best families in the South.
10777809 10780300 And when it comes time for her to marry...
10780379 10783314 ...well, she'll be a little princess.
10784249 10786183 You certainly are making a fool of yourself.
10786485 10787747 And why shouldn't l?
10788787 10791688 She's the first person<br />who's ever completely belonged to me.
10793091 10794786 Great balls of fire!
10794860 10796384 I had the baby, didn't l?
10797329 10798887 It's Melanie. May I come in?
10798964 10799988 Come in, Melly.
10800198 10803599 Yes, come in and look at my daughter's<br />beautiful blue eyes.
10805904 10808737 But, Captain Butler, most babies have<br />blue eyes when they're born.
10808807 10811776 Don't try to tell him anything.<br />He knows everything about babies.
10811843 10814937 Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br />and they're going to stay blue.
10815113 10817013 As blue as the bonnie blue flag.
10818016 10820314 That's it. That's what we'll call her.
10820585 10821745 Bonnie Blue Butler.
10830562 10831688 Try again, Mammy.
10839771 10840897 Twenty inches.
10841406 10844375 Twenty inches!<br />I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
10845010 10847535 You've simply got to make it<br />18 and a half again, Mammy.
10847612 10849136 You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...
10849214 10851580 ...and you ain't never goin' to be<br />no 18 and a half inches again.
10851650 10854016 Never. And there ain't nothin'<br />to do about it.
10855220 10857211 There is something to do about it!
10857456 10860084 I'm just not going to get old and fat<br />before my time.
10861193 10863127 I just won't have any more babies!
10864062 10867122 I heard Mr. Rhett say<br />that he'll be wantin' a son next year.
10867866 10870699 Go tell Captain Butler<br />I've decided not to go out after all.
10870769 10872396 I'll have supper in my room.
10893058 10896789 I got your message.<br />I'll have them bring my supper up here too.
10903802 10905497 No objections to that, I hope?
10905604 10906730 No.
10908006 10908973 Yes.
10910976 10913308 I mean, I don't care<br />where you have your supper.
10916114 10917138 Rhett?
10918083 10919050 Yes?
10919117 10920141 You see...
10920719 10922380 ...well, I've decided...
10924623 10926955 ...well, I hope I don't have<br />any more children.
10939738 10942639 My pet, as I told you<br />before Bonnie was born...
10943542 10946534 ...it's immaterial to me<br />whether you have one child or 20!
10946645 10948135 No, but you know what l....
10948880 10950438 Do you know what I mean?
10950549 10953609 I do. And do you know<br />I can divorce you for this?
10954853 10957083 You're just low enough<br />to think of something like that!
10957155 10960921 If you had any chivalry in you or would<br />be nice like, well, look at Ashley Wilkes!
10960992 10963517 Melanie can't have any more children<br />and he....
10965931 10968627 You've been to the lumber office<br />this afternoon, haven't you?
10968700 10970395 What has that got to do with it?
10972003 10975268 Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br />Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.
10975473 10977703 It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
10979010 10981001 You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
10981079 10982137 Sorry for me?
10982380 10985941 Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing<br />away happiness with both hands...
10986051 10988485 ...and reaching out for something<br />that will never make you happy.
10988553 10990145 I don't know what you're talking about.
10990221 10993156 If you were free and Miss Melly were dead<br />and you had your precious...
10993224 10996125 ...honorable Ashley, do you think<br />you'd be happy with him?
10997395 11000387 You'd never know him,<br />never even understand his mind...
11001132 11004067 ...any more than you understand anything<br />except money.
11004402 11006370 Never mind about that!<br />What I want to know is--
11006438 11009965 You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.<br />It'll work no hardship on me.
11010875 11012399 Do you mean to say you don't care?
11012477 11016038 The world is full of many things<br />and many people, and I shan't be lonely.
11016715 11018273 I'll find comfort elsewhere.
11018717 11020548 Well, that's fine. But I warn you.
11020785 11023720 Just in case you change your mind,<br />I intend to lock my door.
11024022 11027480 Why bother? lf I wanted to come in,<br />no lock could keep me out!
11046111 11049444 I always knew that most women<br />were cheats, hypocritical and hard.
11049581 11052015 -But this one....<br />-Rhett, it ain't no use.
11052083 11054779 -What do you mean?<br />-I mean you're poisoned with her.
11055053 11058386 I don't care what she's done to you,<br />you're still in love with her.
11058490 11060390 And don't think it pleasures me none<br />to say it.
11060458 11063359 Maybe so! But I'm through with her,<br />I tell you! I'm through.
11063428 11066693 You gotta think of the child.<br />The child's worth ten of the mother.
11073371 11076067 You're a shrewd woman, Belle,<br />and a very nice one.
11078243 11079232 Yes, Rhett?
11079310 11082211 I was just thinking of the difference<br />between you, and...
11082947 11086348 ...you're both hard-headed business women<br />and you're both successful.
11086484 11088315 But you've got a heart, Belle...
11090221 11091518 ...and you're honest.
11094292 11095452 Goodbye, Rhett.
11096761 11097989 Goodbye, Belle.
11113878 11116039 She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!
11116281 11118306 Look at those hands, and that seat!
11118616 11119913 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
11120085 11123020 Just why we have to wheel the baby<br />when we have a house full of servants....
11123088 11124146 Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
11124222 11125746 Good morning, Captain Butler.
11125824 11127155 Good morning, Scarlett.
11127225 11130126 Making fools of ourselves<br />in front of these old buffaloes!
11130261 11133128 If you'd thought of your position years ago,<br />you wouldn't have to do this.
11133198 11137430 But as it is, we'll cultivate every female<br />dragon of the old guard in this town.
11138436 11139835 Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
11139904 11143203 Good morning, Captain Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
11143975 11146705 So the millionaire speculator's<br />turning respectable!
11147412 11149607 All of our money can't buy<br />what I want for Bonnie.
11149681 11151911 Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.
11151983 11154315 But Bonnie's going to have a place<br />among decent people.
11154385 11157980 Yes, even if we both have to crawl<br />on our bellies to every fat old cat.
11158957 11160652 Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
11160959 11163621 Good morning, Captain Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
11170168 11173103 Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had<br />a great regard for your knowledge.
11173171 11174866 I wonder if you could give me some advice.
11174939 11175928 Why, certainly, Captain Butler.
11176007 11178305 My Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br />I can't make her stop it.
11178376 11180810 You should make her stop it.<br />It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
11180879 11181937 I know, I know.
11182046 11185607 She has such a beautiful mouth, too.<br />I tried putting soap under her nails.
11185750 11186842 Soap! Bah!
11186918 11190410 Put quinine on her thumb<br />and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
11190655 11193180 Quinine! I never would have thought of it.
11193591 11195718 I can't thank you enough,<br />Mrs. Merriwether.
11195794 11198888 You've taken a great load off my mind!<br />Good morning.
11202634 11203896 Good morning, Dolly.
11204068 11205535 Wasn't that Captain Butler?
11205770 11208238 Good morning, Caroline.<br />I was just thinking.
11208706 11212733 There must be a great deal of good<br />in a man who could love a child so much.
11212877 11214504 But of course there is!
11214813 11218544 Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing<br />told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler...
11218650 11221380 ...finally admitted he was honored<br />by the Confederate Congress...
11221452 11223579 ...for his services at the Battle of Franklin?
11223655 11227113 No! And did I tell you, Caroline,<br />that Captain Butler...
11227225 11230422 ...made a stupendous contribution<br />to the Association for the Beautification...
11230495 11232429 ...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
11232497 11233486 No!
11234232 11237929 My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,<br />is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
11238169 11240933 Why, Dolly Merriwether,<br />you know right well it was my idea...
11241005 11242370 ...to give a party for Bonnie Butler!
11242440 11243771 Why Caroline Meade....
11252984 11255919 Now watch Daddy put your pony over,<br />Bonnie. Now watch.
11259157 11261455 Daddy, let me! Let me!
11261626 11263958 All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!
11267665 11268791 Up we go.
11269133 11270430 Oh, there!
11270735 11273260 Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!
11273371 11276670 Grip tightly with your legs and sit close.<br />Lean forward and be sure you go with him.
11276741 11279539 Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.<br />Up!
11280712 11282942 That was fine! I knew you'd do it!
11283248 11286115 When you get a little older,<br />I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
11286184 11289642 You'll be the greatest horsewoman<br />in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
11290788 11292085 Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!
11293224 11294248 Mr. Rhett!
11295260 11297490 Did you see her, Mammy?<br />Wasn't she wonderful?
11297929 11301865 Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you<br />it just ain't fittin'...
11301933 11305027 ...for a girl child to ride astraddle<br />with her dress flyin' up!
11305203 11307569 All right, Mammy.<br />I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
11307639 11310870 And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.<br />She'll love that.
11310942 11313240 A nice black broadcloth is<br />what little girls wear.
11313311 11315438 Now, Mammy, be reasonable.
11315947 11318142 Well, I don't think it's fittin', but....
11320184 11322311 It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.
11324088 11325385 It ain't fittin'.
11335600 11336828 Why, Scarlett!
11337602 11339593 What are you doing downtown<br />at this time of day?
11339671 11340660 Ashley, I just--
11340738 11344105 Why aren't you helping Melly get ready<br />for my surprise birthday party?
11344375 11347674 Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed<br />to know anything about that.
11348112 11350672 Melly'd be so disappointed<br />if you weren't surprised.
11350848 11354045 I won't let on.<br />I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
11355219 11357346 As long as you're here,<br />let me show you the books...
11357422 11360220 ...so you can see just how bad<br />a businessman I really am.
11360291 11362452 Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.
11362760 11365320 When I'm wearing a new bonnet,<br />all the figures I ever knew...
11365396 11367125 ...go right slap out of my head.
11367198 11370429 The figures are well lost<br />when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.
11370902 11373871 Scarlett, you know,<br />you get prettier all the time.
11374839 11378673 You haven't changed a bit since the day<br />of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
11379210 11382145 ...where you sat under a tree<br />surrounded by dozens of beaux.
11384282 11386682 That girl doesn't exist anymore.
11387185 11389745 Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.
11390088 11391180 Nothing.
11391889 11395586 Yes, we've travelled a long road<br />since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?
11396260 11397818 Oh, the lazy days...
11398062 11400257 ...the warm, still country twilights...
11401566 11404126 ...the high, soft negro laughter<br />from the quarters...
11405370 11408601 ...the golden warmth and security<br />of those days.
11410842 11412309 Don't look back, Ashley.
11413044 11414204 Don't look back.
11416347 11421046 It drags at your heart<br />till you can't do anything, but look back.
11426190 11428283 I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
11429560 11432552 I'd never want you to be anything<br />but completely happy.
11453017 11454075 Oh, Ashley!
11456654 11457678 Who is it?
11457755 11458949 Only your husband.
11460058 11460854 Come in.
11462126 11464560 Am I actually being invited<br />into the sanctuary?
11466130 11468064 You're not ready for Melanie's party.
11468599 11470066 I've got a headache, Rhett.
11470201 11472669 You go without me,<br />and make my excuses to Melanie.
11474672 11477140 What a white-livered little coward you are!<br />Get up!
11477642 11480236 You're going to that party<br />and you'll have to hurry.
11480678 11482543 -Has lndia dared to--<br />-Yes. India has!
11482613 11484604 Every woman and man in town<br />knows the story!
11484682 11486115 You should kill them, spreading lies.
11486184 11488880 I have a strange way of not killing people<br />who tell the truth.
11488953 11490284 There's no time to argue now. Get up!
11490354 11493517 I won't go! I can't go<br />until this misunderstanding is cleared up.
11493591 11496185 You won't cheat Miss Melly<br />out of the satisfaction of publicly...
11496260 11497659 ...ordering you out of her house.
11497728 11499457 There was nothing wrong.<br />India hates me so.
11499530 11501430 I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.
11501499 11504991 If you don't show it tonight,<br />you'll never be able to as long as you live.
11505069 11507970 While that wouldn't bother me,<br />you're ruining Bonnie's chances.
11508039 11511372 You're going to that party,<br />if only for her sake. Now, get dressed!
11524922 11528323 Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly<br />will do for this occasion.
11528860 11531852 And put on plenty of rouge.<br />I want you to look your part tonight.
11539137 11544268 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow
11544442 11549470 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny
11549914 11553611 "Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny
11554352 11556786 "For he's a jolly good fellow...."
11558589 11561114 -Good night, Scarlett.<br />-But Rhett, you can't--
11561192 11564161 You go into the arena alone.<br />The lions are hungry for you.
11564362 11565954 Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.
11566030 11567190 You're not afraid?
11567398 11569525 "Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny
11569600 11574162 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow
11574272 11579539 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny."
11594058 11596083 What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.
11596427 11598088 India wasn't able to come tonight.
11598162 11599390 Will you be an angel?
11599463 11601954 I do need you to help me<br />receive my guests.
11605770 11607203 Mrs. Meade...
11607438 11609065 ...here's our darling Scarlett.
11611108 11612166 Good evening.
11612276 11613334 Good evening.
11613611 11614669 Why Scarlett!
11615446 11618313 -Good evening, Miss Scarlett.<br />-Good evening, Mrs. Butler.
11619083 11622211 Ashley, aren't you going to get<br />our Scarlett a glass of punch?
11630161 11633096 Did you have a good time tonight<br />at Miss Melly's party, child?
11633164 11634188 Yes, yes.
11634265 11636130 Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word...
11636200 11639294 ...if Captain Butler asks for me<br />when he comes back, I'm asleep.
11639670 11640659 Yes, ma'am.
11670101 11671398 Come in, Mrs. Butler.
11680911 11682037 Come here.
11697928 11698952 Sit down!
11701632 11705261 There's no reason why you shouldn't have<br />your nightcap even if I am here.
11705403 11707564 I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and--
11707638 11709401 You heard nothing of the kind.
11709974 11712704 You wouldn't have come down<br />if you'd thought I was here.
11712843 11715073 -You must need a drink badly.<br />-I do not!
11715146 11717944 Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
11718015 11721075 I know you drink on the quiet,<br />and I know how much you drink.
11721519 11723817 Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
11730961 11732292 You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!
11732363 11733853 I'm very drunk...
11734198 11737395 ...and I intend getting still drunker<br />before the evening's over...
11738135 11740865 ...but you're not going to bed, not yet!
11742139 11743265 Sit down!
11746477 11748411 So she stood by you, did she?
11749647 11753242 How does it feel to have the woman<br />you've wronged cloak your sins for you?
11754919 11757615 You're wondering if she knows<br />all about you and Ashley.
11758155 11760749 You're wondering if she did it<br />just to save her face.
11761392 11765021 You're thinking that she's a fool for doing it<br />even if it did save your hide.
11765096 11767257 -I will not listen.<br />-Yes, you'll listen!
11768332 11770732 Miss Melly's a fool,<br />but not the kind you think.
11771635 11774798 It's just that there's too much honor in her<br />to ever conceive of dishonor...
11774872 11776464 ...in anyone she loves.
11777375 11778637 And she loves you.
11779410 11782243 Though just why she does,<br />I'm sure I don't know!
11783414 11786679 If you weren't so drunk and insulting,<br />I could explain everything.
11787151 11790052 -As it is though--<br />-If you get out of that chair once more!
11794458 11799088 Of course, the comic figure in all this is<br />the long suffering Mr. Wilkes!
11800131 11803100 Mr. Wilkes, who can't be<br />mentally faithful to his wife...
11803200 11805760 ...and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
11807438 11809201 Why doesn't he make up his mind?
11809306 11810398 Rhett, you....
11813844 11816244 Observe my hands, my dear.
11817248 11819682 I could tear you to pieces with them.
11820351 11823878 And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley<br />out of your mind forever.
11824955 11826513 But it wouldn't.
11827358 11831124 So I'll remove him<br />from your mind forever this way.
11832329 11834422 I'll put my hands so...
11835299 11837426 ...one on each side of your head...
11838436 11842497 ...and I'll smash your skull between them<br />like a walnut.
11843307 11845537 And that'll block him out.
11846811 11849507 Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.
11854785 11858016 You know I've always admired<br />your spirit, my dear.
11858989 11861287 Never more than now,<br />when you're cornered.
11862460 11863620 I'm not cornered.
11863894 11866727 And you'll never corner me,<br />Rhett Butler, or frighten me!
11866797 11869960 You've lived in dirt so long,<br />you can't understand anything else.
11870367 11874098 And you're jealous of something<br />you can't understand. Good night!
11876640 11878005 Jealous, am l?
11878108 11879632 Yes, I suppose I am.
11880511 11883537 Even though I know you've been faithful<br />to me all along.
11884148 11885376 How do I know?
11885516 11888679 Because I know Ashley Wilkes,<br />and his honorable breed.
11889286 11890378 They're gentlemen!
11891021 11893683 And that's more than I can say<br />for you or for me!
11894692 11898219 We're not gentlemen,<br />and we have no honor, have we?
11907872 11909965 It's not that easy, Scarlett.
11914311 11916279 You turned me out<br />while you chased Ashley Wilkes.
11916347 11918144 While you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.
11918215 11920445 This is one night<br />you're not turning me out!
11948946 11951073 How are you feeling this morning, Mammy?
11951148 11955016 Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.
11957988 11960513 You actin' mighty happy this mornin',<br />Miss Scarlett.
11960658 11962125 I am, Mammy. I am.
11969266 11974101 "Oh, she wept with delight<br />when he gave her a smile
11974605 11979167 "And trembled with fear at his frown."
11996060 11997084 Hello.
11999930 12003525 I'd like to extend my apologies<br />for my conduct of last night.
12003801 12004995 Oh, but Rhett....
12005502 12006730 I was very drunk...
12006804 12010069 ...and quite swept off my feet<br />by your charms.
12012309 12015870 Well, you needn't bother to apologize.<br />Nothing you ever do surprises me!
12016580 12019378 I've been thinking things over,<br />and I really believe that...
12019450 12020940 ...it would be better for both of us...
12021018 12023748 ...if we admitted we'd made a mistake<br />and got a divorce.
12023954 12025216 -A divorce?<br />-Yes.
12025723 12028351 There's no point in our holding on<br />to each other, is there?
12028425 12030950 I'll provide for you amply.<br />You've plenty of grounds.
12031028 12033861 Just give me Bonnie. You can say<br />what you please, I won't contest it.
12033931 12034920 Thank you very much.
12034999 12038025 But I wouldn't dream of disgracing<br />the family with a divorce.
12038769 12041260 You'd disgrace it quick enough<br />if Ashley were free.
12041338 12044330 It makes my head spin to think<br />how quickly you'd divorce me.
12045476 12046875 Wouldn't you, Scarlett?
12048312 12049540 Well, answer me.
12049613 12050637 Wouldn't you?
12050714 12052944 Will you please go now,<br />and leave me alone?
12054485 12056817 Yes, I'm going.<br />That's what I came to tell you.
12057821 12061222 I'm going on a very extended trip<br />to London, and I'm leaving today.
12062559 12064220 And I'm taking Bonnie with me.
12064294 12066762 So you'll please get<br />her little duds packed right away.
12066830 12069060 You'll never take my child<br />out of this house.
12069466 12071331 She's my child, too, Scarlett.
12071435 12073528 You're making a mistake,<br />if you think I'm leaving her here...
12073604 12076266 ...with a mother who hasn't the decency<br />to consider her own reputation.
12076340 12077739 You're a fine one to talk.
12078342 12079741 You think I'll let that child out<br />of this house...
12079810 12083439 ...when you'll probably have her around<br />with people like that Belle?
12083547 12085913 If you were a man<br />I'd break your neck for that.
12086316 12088477 As it is, I'll thank you<br />to shut your stupid mouth.
12088552 12091419 As for you, giving yourself pious airs<br />about your motherhood....
12091488 12093752 Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.
12093857 12096826 Have her things packed and ready<br />for me in an hour, or I warn you....
12096894 12100728 I've always thought a good lashing with a<br />buggy whip would benefit you immensely.
12106203 12107465 Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
12108505 12109529 Hello, Uncle Rhett.
12109606 12111073 Hello, hello, Beau.
12111141 12112472 Daddy, Daddy!
12112876 12116209 Where have you been?<br />I've been waiting for you all morning.
12116413 12119940 Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin<br />to wrap my little Bonnie in.
12120117 12122017 Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
12125456 12128550 I'm going to take you<br />on a long trip to fairyland!
12129593 12130890 Where? Where?
12131295 12134890 I'm going to show you the Tower<br />of London, where the little princes were...
12135199 12136530 ...and London Bridge.
12137201 12138634 London Bridge!
12138736 12140533 Will it be falling down?
12142039 12144303 Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
12146844 12148971 Daddy, dark!
12150347 12151837 Dark!
12152015 12153039 Daddy! Dark!
12155085 12157815 It's all right.<br />Who put out that light? Nurse!
12157888 12159321 Daddy, dark!
12160624 12161716 Daddy, dark!
12161792 12163453 There. Yes, yes.
12164027 12165858 What's the matter with my Bonnie?
12165996 12167293 A bear.
12167731 12169995 Oh, a bear? A big bear?
12170467 12173368 Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.
12173470 12176769 Well, I'll stay here and shoot him<br />if he comes back.
12191989 12193616 Good evening, Mr. Butler.
12196827 12199557 Haven't I told you never to leave her alone<br />in the dark?
12199630 12203589 If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often<br />afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
12203667 12205362 If you just let her scream<br />for a night or two.
12205435 12209428 Let her scream! Either you're a fool or<br />the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!
12209506 12212100 Of course, sir, if you want her<br />to grow up nervous and cowardly.
12212176 12213165 Cowardly!
12213377 12216744 There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.<br />You're discharged!
12217648 12218808 As you say, sir.
12235833 12237323 Where is Mother?
12243874 12246001 Aren't you happy here in London with me?
12246677 12249168 I want to go home.
12261358 12262723 Miss Bonnie!
12263026 12264891 And Captain Butler!
12265229 12267060 -Miss Scarlett!<br />-Hello, Mammy.
12267331 12268559 Honey, child!
12269967 12272765 Miss Scarlett! They's back!<br />They's back, Miss Scarlett!
12272936 12273994 Bonnie!
12275072 12276972 Bonnie! Bonnie, baby!
12277307 12278604 Darling, baby!
12278675 12280074 Are you glad to be home?
12280143 12281508 Daddy gave me a kitten.
12281778 12285043 -What a little, lovely kitten!<br />-London's a horrid place.
12285582 12287846 -Oh, my darling.<br />-Where's my pony?
12288051 12291248 -I want to go out and see my pony.<br />-You go out and see your pony.
12300731 12301891 Where's my pony?
12303400 12305129 I wanna go out and see my pony.
12305869 12307598 You run along with Mammy.
12307671 12309161 -Come on, honey child.<br />-Go with Mammy.
12309239 12311230 Mammy sure has missed you, honey.
12313410 12314843 Mrs. Butler, I believe.
12315879 12317369 Mammy said you'd come back.
12318849 12320339 But only to bring Bonnie.
12320417 12323818 Apparently any mother, even a bad one,<br />is better for a child than none.
12324621 12326384 You mean you're going away again?
12326790 12328348 What perception, Mrs. Butler.
12328725 12329817 Right away.
12329960 12331985 In fact, I left my bags at the station.
12334131 12336895 You're looking pale.<br />Is there a shortage of rouge?
12337401 12339892 Or can this wanness mean<br />you've been missing me?
12340804 12342362 If I'm pale, it's your fault.
12342439 12344839 Not because I've been missing you,<br />but because....
12349179 12350703 Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
12351915 12354179 It's because I'm going to have a baby.
12360223 12361247 Indeed?
12361725 12363488 And who's the happy father?
12364294 12365522 You know it's yours.
12365862 12367659 I don't want it any more than you do.
12367731 12369892 No woman would want the child<br />of a cad like you.
12369967 12372663 I wish it were anybody's child but yours.
12374638 12376970 Well, cheer up.<br />Maybe you'll have an accident.
12391588 12392714 Is she better?
12397327 12398726 Has she asked for me?
12398795 12400888 Don't you understand? She's delirious.
12402432 12404229 Rhett!
12405502 12407129 I want Rhett!
12411408 12414707 What's the matter, honey?<br />Did you call somebody, child?
12414878 12416311 It's no use.
12417581 12418912 It's no use.
12440971 12442097 Dr. Meade's left.
12443573 12444767 Scarlett's dead!
12444975 12446704 Oh, no, she's much better.
12447277 12448335 Really she is.
12465328 12467956 There, there, Captain Butler.<br />You're beside yourself.
12468498 12470728 She'll very soon be well again,<br />I promise you.
12470801 12473770 No, you don't understand.<br />She never wanted this baby.
12473970 12476404 Not want a baby?<br />Why, every woman wants a baby!
12476540 12479407 Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.<br />Not my children.
12479810 12481937 She told me she didn't want<br />any more children...
12482012 12484071 ...and I wanted to hurt her<br />because she'd hurt me.
12484147 12485444 I wanted to and I did.
12485515 12488643 Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.<br />It's not fit.
12488718 12491551 I didn't know about this baby<br />until the other day when she fell.
12491621 12494613 If I'd known, I'd have come straight home<br />whether she wanted me or not!
12494691 12496283 Well, of course you would.
12496493 12499792 And then when she told me,<br />there on the steps, what did I do?
12500363 12503161 What did I say? I laughed and I said--
12503233 12505701 But you didn't mean it.<br />I know you didn't mean it.
12506670 12509104 Oh, but I did mean it.<br />I was crazy with jealousy.
12509439 12513034 She's never cared for me. I thought I could<br />make her care, but I couldn't.
12515011 12516239 You're so wrong.
12516646 12519979 Scarlett loves you a great deal,<br />much more than she knows.
12521585 12523553 If that were only true I could wait forever.
12523620 12525815 If she'd only forgive me,<br />forget this ever happened.
12525922 12526911 She will.
12527324 12528916 You must be patient.
12531328 12532727 Oh, no, it's not possible.
12533096 12536122 You don't understand.<br />If you only knew who she really loved...
12537234 12538826 ...you wouldn't believe it.
12542105 12544539 Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
12544774 12547265 No, Captain Butler, I wouldn't believe it.
12549346 12553715 There, there. Scarlett's going to get well<br />and there can be other babies.
12554017 12557748 Oh no, no, she couldn't even if she<br />wanted to, after what she's been through.
12557821 12559789 But of course she could.
12560323 12561722 I'm going to.
12564661 12567892 No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.<br />It's too dangerous.
12568365 12570959 Children are life renewing itself,<br />Captain Butler...
12571501 12574993 ...and when life does that<br />danger seems very unimportant.
12578108 12580838 I've never before known anyone<br />who was really brave.
12581978 12584469 I pray God things go well with you,<br />Miss Melly.
12585081 12588573 And I want to thank you for all<br />you've done for me and for Scarlett.
12590053 12591714 From my heart, I thank you.
12598795 12601457 Miss Scarlett's feelin' a heap better today,<br />Mr. Rhett.
12602165 12603325 Thank you, Mammy.
12610840 12612831 I've come to ask your forgiveness...
12613176 12616077 ...in the hope that we can give<br />our life together another chance.
12616146 12617374 Our life together?
12617814 12619907 When did we ever have a life together?
12621251 12622445 Yes, you're right.
12623386 12626844 But I'm sure if we could only try again,<br />we could be happy.
12627557 12629821 Well, what is there to make us happy now?
12630760 12632921 Well, there's Bonnie and...
12633964 12635591 ...and I love you, Scarlett.
12636266 12637790 When did you discover that?
12638101 12641468 I've always loved you, but you've never<br />given me a chance to show it.
12643173 12645607 Well, and just what do you want me to do?
12647444 12649605 To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.
12650447 12651607 We'll go away.
12651681 12653774 We'll take Bonnie and we'll have<br />another honeymoon.
12653850 12656717 Give up the mill? But why?<br />It's making more money than ever.
12656786 12658720 Yes, I know, but we don't need it.
12658788 12661279 Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.
12661891 12663620 Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.
12663693 12666423 Always Melanie!<br />lf you'd only think a little more about me....
12666496 12667827 I am thinking of you...
12668999 12670796 ...and I'm thinking that...
12671001 12674232 ...well, maybe it's the mill<br />that's taken you away from me...
12674671 12676002 ...and from Bonnie.
12676072 12678836 I know what you're thinking.<br />Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.
12678908 12680569 You're the one taking her away from me.
12680644 12681804 But she loves you.
12681878 12684312 You've done everything possible<br />to make her love you and not me.
12684381 12685643 Why, she's so spoiled now that--
12685715 12687046 Mommy! Daddy!
12687450 12688439 Watch me!
12689019 12690043 We're watching, darling.
12690854 12692617 You're mighty pretty, precious.
12692889 12694151 So are you.
12694557 12697185 I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.
12697927 12700623 I don't think you ought to do<br />much jumping yet, Bonnie.
12700697 12703029 Remember, you've just learned<br />to ride sidesaddle.
12703099 12704430 I will so jump!
12704534 12707025 I can jump better than ever<br />'cause I've grown...
12707504 12709096 ...and I've moved the bar higher.
12709172 12710537 Don't let her do it, Rhett.
12711041 12715137 No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,<br />don't cry and blame me.
12716112 12717602 Rhett, stop her!
12719582 12720708 Bonnie!
12721518 12722507 Bonnie!
12723887 12725013 Just like Pa.
12728858 12729984 Just like Pa!
12731594 12732686 Bonnie!
12741271 12742260 Bonnie!
12743039 12744006 Bonnie!
12761187 12764156 Lordsy, Miss Melly.<br />I sure is glad you has come.
12766793 12769694 This house won't seem<br />the same without Bonnie.
12769763 12771424 How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
12771698 12774531 Miss Melly, this here done<br />broke her heart...
12775268 12777862 ...but I didn't fetch you here<br />on Miss Scarlett's account.
12777937 12782135 What that child got to stand,<br />the good Lord give her strength to stand.
12783610 12785635 It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
12789449 12791940 He done lost his mind<br />these last couple of days.
12792052 12793485 No, Mammy, no.
12793953 12797889 I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,<br />set such store on any child.
12798691 12800784 When Dr. Meade says her neck broke...
12801161 12804858 ...Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there<br />and shoot that poor pony...
12805832 12808767 ...and for a minute I think<br />he going to shoot hisself.
12808935 12810698 Oh, poor Captain Butler.
12810770 12815503 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him<br />a murderer for teachin' that child to jump.
12816009 12818375 She say, "You give me my baby<br />what you kill."
12818845 12822576 And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't<br />never cared nothin' about Miss Bonnie.
12823116 12827143 It like to turn my blood cold,<br />the things they say to one another.
12827654 12829713 Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
12832926 12834689 And then that night...
12835728 12839129 ...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br />in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...
12840333 12841891 ...and he wouldn't even open the door...
12841968 12844129 ...when Miss Scarlett beat on it<br />and hollered to him.
12844204 12846468 And that's the way it's been<br />for two whole days.
12846573 12847767 Oh, Mammy.
12849075 12852203 And then this evenin',<br />Miss Scarlett, she shout through the door...
12852512 12854707 ...and she say the funeral set<br />for tomorrow mornin'...
12854781 12857579 ...and he says "You try that<br />and I kills you tomorrow.
12857884 12860478 "Do you think I's goin'<br />to put my child away in the...
12860920 12862751 "...in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
12863256 12866089 Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.
12866159 12869686 Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.<br />He ain't goin' to let us bury that child.
12869762 12871491 You gotta help us, Miss Melly.
12871931 12873489 Oh, but I can't intrude.
12873633 12875658 If you can't help us, who can?
12875969 12878494 Mr. Rhett always set great store<br />by your opinion.
12881040 12882234 Please, Miss Melly.
12884377 12886277 I'll do what I can, Mammy.
12892952 12895113 Get away from that door,<br />and leave us alone.
12895455 12897218 It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.
12897557 12899149 Please let me in.
12899225 12900817 I've come to see Bonnie.
12922182 12923206 Oh, Lord...
12923983 12926543 ...please help Mr. Rhett<br />in this hour of his grief.
12938965 12942025 I want you to go and make<br />a good deal of strong coffee...
12942268 12945863 ...and bring it up to Captain Butler.<br />I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
12946339 12947237 But....
12947740 12950937 Captain Butler is quite willing<br />for the funeral to take place...
12951110 12952304 ...tomorrow morning.
12952378 12957111 Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights<br />on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.
12958418 12960045 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
12960887 12961751 Miss Melly!
12961854 12963515 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
12965258 12967226 Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...
12967927 12969053 ...and try...
12969262 12970923 ...try to get me home.
12972632 12974190 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
12982041 12984441 Where is my mother goin' away to?
12984611 12987512 And why can't I go along, please?
12988047 12991380 We can't always go along, Beau,<br />much as we may want to.
12993086 12994883 You're going back to bed now.
12995922 12999119 Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!
12999859 13001258 She hasn't your strength.
13001327 13004626 She's never had any strength.<br />She's never had anything but heart.
13005131 13006393 You knew that, too.
13006633 13009466 Why do I have to go back to bed?<br />It's morning.
13010169 13012194 It isn't really morning yet.
13018444 13020105 You may come in now, Scarlett.
13020280 13021611 Dr. Meade, please let me see her!
13021681 13025310 I've been waiting here two whole days<br />and I've got to tell her...
13025785 13027412 ...that I was wrong about something.
13027487 13030149 She knows you were wrong.<br />She wants to see Scarlett.
13034093 13036027 Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
13036095 13038427 I won't have you easing your conscience<br />telling her things...
13038498 13040864 ...that make no difference now.<br />You understand?
13056049 13057141 It's me, Melly.
13058985 13060111 Promise me?
13061187 13062176 Anything.
13063456 13065219 Look after my little son.
13066626 13068890 I gave him to you once before.
13069996 13071463 Remember?
13072332 13073731 The day he was born.
13074267 13077566 Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<br />I know you'll get well.
13078404 13079393 Promise me...
13080306 13081364 ...college....
13081474 13085672 Yes, yes, and Europe, and a pony,<br />whatever he wants. But...
13086846 13088074 ...Melly, do try....
13088481 13089448 Ashley....
13091517 13092677 Ashley and you.
13095321 13098085 What about Ashley, Melly?
13099592 13101787 Look after him for me.
13102562 13103756 Just as you...
13105231 13106789 ...looked after me for him.
13110770 13111862 I will, Melly.
13113473 13115805 Look after him...
13115875 13118776 ...but never let him know.
13128855 13129913 Good night.
13131824 13132813 Promise?
13134494 13135722 What else, Melly?
13136963 13138726 Captain Butler...
13140133 13141600 ...be kind to him.
13142301 13143325 Rhett?
13144137 13145764 He loves you so.
13149909 13151035 Yes, Melly.
13154247 13155373 Goodbye.
13156883 13157907 Goodbye.
13174133 13175657 You ladies may come in now.
13181674 13183005 Ashley.
13183876 13186470 I don't know where the mate to this is.
13187447 13189074 She must have put it away.
13190216 13191615 Oh, stop it.
13192185 13193277 Hold me.
13193686 13195278 I'm so frightened.
13197123 13198590 I'm so frightened.
13203696 13207223 Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?<br />I can't live without her, I can't.
13208868 13210335 Everything I ever had is...
13210837 13212327 ...is going with her.
13213539 13214801 Oh, Ashley.
13216309 13218243 You really love her, don't you?
13219045 13223744 She's the only dream I ever had<br />that didn't die in the face of reality.
13224650 13227619 Dreams! Always dreams with you,<br />never common sense.
13227887 13230378 Oh, Scarlett!<br />lf you knew what I've gone through!
13232024 13235790 Ashley, you should have told me years ago<br />that you loved her and not me...
13236195 13239130 ...and not left me dangling<br />with your talk of honor.
13239232 13242429 But you had to wait till now,<br />now when Melly's dying...
13243369 13246304 ...to show me that I could never mean<br />any more to you than...
13246806 13248933 ...than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
13251310 13253141 And I've loved something that...
13254013 13255913 ...that doesn't really exist.
13258584 13259812 Somehow...
13261153 13262518 ...l don't care.
13264056 13265751 Somehow it doesn't matter.
13267894 13269521 It doesn't matter one bit.
13274634 13276158 Ashley, forgive me.
13276869 13279770 Don't cry.<br />She mustn't see you've been crying.
13280306 13281432 Ashley!
13284977 13286274 Melly!
13288147 13289478 Melly!
13293920 13295911 Rhett, Rhett!
13299358 13300689 Rhett, where are you?
13305231 13306664 Rhett, wait for me.
13311737 13313204 Rhett, wait for me!
13340533 13341693 Rhett.
13344870 13345962 Come in.
13353980 13355038 Rhett....
13355715 13357273 Melanie, she's....
13361020 13362180 Well, God rest her.
13362955 13365788 She was the only completely kind person<br />I ever knew.
13366826 13368157 A great lady.
13368594 13369788 A very great lady.
13372632 13376033 So she's dead.<br />That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
13377003 13380734 Oh, how can you say such a thing?<br />You know how I loved her, really!
13382074 13383564 No, I don't know that I do.
13384110 13387341 But at least it's to your credit<br />that you could appreciate her at the end.
13387413 13390712 Of course I appreciated her.<br />She thought of everybody except herself.
13391984 13393815 Why her last words were about you.
13395021 13396181 What did she say?
13396489 13397649 She said:
13398057 13400582 "Be kind to Captain Butler.<br />He loves you so."
13406799 13407959 Did she say anything else?
13408034 13409524 She said...
13410102 13412468 ...she asked me to look after Ashley, too.
13414874 13417968 It's convenient to have<br />the first wife's permission, isn't it?
13420346 13421506 What do you mean?
13424417 13425577 What are you doing?
13426118 13427642 I'm leaving you, my dear.
13428020 13431649 All you need now is a divorce,<br />and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
13434960 13436518 Oh, no!
13437263 13439493 No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!
13439732 13442860 I don't want a divorce.<br />Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...
13442968 13445528 ...when I knew I loved you,<br />I ran home to tell you.
13445604 13447504 Oh, darling, darling....
13447673 13449265 Please don't go on with this.
13449341 13452970 Leave us some dignity to remember<br />out of our marriage. Spare us this last.
13453045 13454171 This last?
13454547 13456105 Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.
13456315 13460183 I must have loved you for years, only I was<br />such a stupid fool I didn't know it.
13460252 13462584 Please believe me. You must care.
13463122 13464384 Melly said you did.
13465024 13467549 I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?
13468694 13470457 I never really loved Ashley.
13471497 13474728 You certainly gave a good imitation of it,<br />up till this morning.
13476035 13478265 No, Scarlett. I tried everything.
13478771 13481672 If you'd only met me half way,<br />even when I came back from London.
13481741 13485404 I was so glad to see you.<br />I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
13485511 13488275 And then, when you were sick<br />and it was all my fault...
13488814 13491647 ...l hoped against hope<br />that you'd call for me, but you didn't.
13491717 13496017 I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,<br />but I didn't think you wanted me.
13497389 13501416 It seems we've been at cross purposes,<br />doesn't it? But it's no use now.
13502561 13505689 As long as there was Bonnie,<br />there was a chance we might be happy.
13506265 13507994 I liked to think that Bonnie was you.
13508067 13511594 A little girl again, before the war,<br />and poverty had done things to you.
13512505 13517033 She was so like you, and I could pet her,<br />and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.
13519145 13521272 But when she went, she took everything.
13521580 13522604 Oh, Rhett!
13523215 13525046 Rhett, please don't say that.
13525117 13527813 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.
13530055 13531750 My darling, you're such a child.
13532625 13536288 You think that by saying, "l'm sorry,"<br />all the past can be corrected.
13539331 13541265 Here, take my handkerchief.
13541901 13545462 Never, at any crisis of your life,<br />have I known you to have a handkerchief.
13551277 13553108 Rhett, where are you going?
13553245 13555304 I'm going to Charleston.<br />Back where I belong.
13555381 13557349 Please. Please take me with you.
13558384 13560909 No. I'm through with everything here.
13561720 13563244 I want peace.
13563455 13567391 I want to see if somewhere there isn't<br />something left in life of charm and grace.
13568494 13571986 -Do you know what I'm talking about?<br />-No. I only know that I love you.
13572932 13574524 That's your misfortune.
13574767 13575791 Oh, Rhett.
13581040 13582029 Rhett!
13588480 13589572 Rhett!
13589715 13592684 If you go, where shall I go?<br />What shall I do?
13593719 13595949 Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
13609969 13612403 Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!
13613305 13615899 There must be some way<br />to bring him back.
13618577 13621774 I can't think about it now.<br />I'll go crazy if I do!
13623616 13625550 I'll think about it tomorrow.
13640032 13642091 But I must think about it.
13642735 13644498 I must think about it.
13646105 13647572 What is there to do?
13649008 13650839 What is there that matters?
13654013 13656208 Do you mean to tell me,<br />Katie Scarlett O'Hara...
13656282 13660378 ...that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?<br />Why, land's the only thing that matters.
13660753 13662846 It's the only thing that lasts.
13663088 13666751 Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.
13666959 13670326 It's this from which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.
13670663 13674360 Why, land's the only thing that matters.<br />It's the only thing that lasts.
13674533 13677764 Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.
13677836 13680737 This from which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.
13680806 13682467 Why, land's the only thing that matters.
13682541 13683906 Something you love better than me.
13683976 13685204 The red earth of Tara.
13685277 13686904 -Tara!<br />-Tara!
13690316 13691374 Tara!
13692818 13693842 Home!
13695187 13696211 I'll go home!
13697723 13700351 And I'll think of some way to get him back.
13700993 13702358 After all...
13702928 13704859 ...tomorrow...
13704894 13706124 ... is another day!
