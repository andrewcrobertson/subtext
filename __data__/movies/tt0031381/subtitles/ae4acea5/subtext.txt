411828 413829 What do we care if we were expelled?
414080 416873 The war's gonna start,<br />so we would've left anyhow.
417125 418834 War! Isn’t it exciting, Scarlett?
419043 421586 - Those fool Yankees want a war.<br />We'll show them!
421838 424506 Fiddle-dee-dee. War, war, war!
424757 427592 This war talk's spoiling<br />all the fun at every party.
427802 430178 I get so bored I could scream.
430388 432597 Besides, there isn't<br />going to be any war.
432849 435767 Not gonna be any war?<br />- Of course there'll be a war.
436018 438478 If either of you boys<br />says "war" once again...
438729 440021 ...I'll go in the house.
440273 443316 - But, Scarlett!<br />- Don't you want us to have a war?
443526 446486 Wait a minute, honey, please!<br />We're sorry.
449157 450740 Well...
451617 454619 But remember, I warned you.
454871 456204 I've got an idea!
456456 458874 We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue<br />at Twelve Oaks.
459125 461543 You're eating barbecue with us,<br />aren't you?
461752 464754 I haven't thought about that yet.<br />I'll think about that tomorrow.
464922 466089 We want all your waltzes.
466257 468675 First Brent, then me,<br />then Brent, and so on.
468926 471636 - Promise?<br />- Why, I'd just love to.
471888 475390 If only I didn't have every one<br />of them taken already.
475641 478393 - You can't do that to us!<br />- We'll tell you a secret.
478603 479769 A secret? Who by?
480021 481646 You know Melanie Hamilton?
481898 484316 Ashley Wilkes' cousin?<br />She's visiting-
484525 487277 That goody-goody!<br />Who wants to know about her?
487528 489029 Anyway, we heard- They say-
489280 491323 Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.
491574 495160 - Wilkeses always marry their cousins.<br />Do we get those waltzes?
495369 496828 Of course.
502293 505212 - It can't be true! Ashley loves me!<br />Scarlett!
506422 509716 - What's gotten into her?<br />- Suppose we made her mad?
509967 513637 Where are you going without your<br />shawl and the night air coming?
513888 516348 How come you didn't ask them<br />gentlemen to supper?
516599 518808 You got no more manners<br />than a field hand.
519018 521645 After me and Miss Ellen<br />done labored with you!
521896 525273 Come on in before you catch<br />your death of dampness.
525900 528527 No! I'm going to wait<br />for Pa to come home.
528778 530445 Come on in here!
530696 532280 Come on!
547296 548630 Quitting time!
548881 551299 - Who says it's quitting time?<br />- I said.
551551 554636 I's the foreman. I say<br />when it's quitting time at Tara.
554887 556513 Quitting time!
556931 558974 Quitting time!
599849 603393 There's none in the county<br />can touch you, and none in the state.
604395 605729 Pa!
605938 608189 How proud of yourself you are!
610276 614279 Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,<br />so you've been spying on me.
614530 618033 Like your sister, you'll tell<br />your mother that I was jumping again.
618242 620410 You know I'm no tattletale<br />like Suellen.
620661 624080 But after you broke your knee<br />last year jumping that fence-
624332 628668 I'll not have me own daughter telling me<br />what I shall jump and not jump.
628919 630337 It's my own neck, so it is.
630588 632714 All right, Pa, you jump what you please.
632965 635342 - How are they at Twelve Oaks?<br />- The Wilkeses?
635551 639721 In the stew you'd expect with a barbecue<br />and talking nothing but war.
639972 643016 Bother the war!<br />Was there anyone else there?
643225 645935 Their cousin Melanie<br />and her brother, Charles.
646187 649564 Melanie Hamilton is a pale-faced,<br />mealy-mouthed ninny!
649774 651191 Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
651442 654277 Ashley Wilkes couldn't like<br />anyone like her.
654945 657822 What's your interest<br />in Ashley and Miss Melanie?
658658 660659 Nothing. Let's go into the house.
660910 664162 Has he been trifling with you?<br />Has he asked you to marry him?
664330 665664 - No.<br />- Nor will he.
665831 668458 I had it in strict confidence<br />from John Wilkes today...
668668 670460 ...Ashley's going to marry Melanie.
670711 673254 It'll be announced<br />tomorrow night at the ball.
673673 674756 I don't believe it!
675508 677634 Here! Where are you off to?
677843 679052 Scarlett!
679387 680637 What are you about?
682056 685975 Have you been running after a man<br />who's not in love with you?
686185 687936 When you might have any other?
688145 691606 I haven't been running after him,<br />it's just a surprise.
691857 694359 Now, don't be jerking<br />your chin at me!
694610 697904 If Ashley wanted to marry you,<br />I'd have misgivings.
698155 701449 I want my girl to be happy.<br />You'd not be happy with him.
701701 702909 I would! I would!
703160 707330 What's the difference who you marry?<br />So long as he's a Southerner.
707540 710125 And when I'm gone<br />I'll leave Tara to you.
710376 712293 I don't want it.<br />It doesn't mean anything-
712545 714796 Do you mean to tell me,<br />Katie Scarlett O'Hara...
715047 717132 ...that land doesn't mean<br />anything to you?
717299 719801 Land is the only thing in the<br />world worth working for...
720052 721886 ...worth fighting for, worth dying for.
722096 725432 - It's the only thing that lasts!<br />- You talk like an Irishman.
725683 729561 It's proud I am that I'm Irish.<br />Don't you be forgetting...
729729 731062 ...that you're half Irish too.
731313 733606 To anyone with a drop<br />of Irish blood in them...
733774 735817 ...the land they live on<br />is like their mother.
736068 738111 But there now. You're just a child.
738320 740447 It'll come to you,<br />this love of the land.
740698 743533 There's no getting away from it<br />if you're Irish.
768142 769309 Here she comes!
769477 771728 Scarlett, Suellen, Carreen,<br />your mama's home!
771979 774814 Acting like a wet nurse to<br />them white-trash Slatterys...
775024 778109 ...instead of eating her supper.<br />Set up the fire!
778360 780320 Got no business wearing herself out...
780529 782864 Pork! Take the lamp<br />out on the porch.
783115 786326 Wearing herself out.<br />Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home!
786577 788578 Waiting on them poor white trash.
788829 790705 Shut up, dog!<br />Barking in the house!
790956 793374 Get up from there!<br />Don't you hear Miss Ellen?
793626 795919 Get out there and get<br />her medicine chest!
796295 798505 We was worried about you, Miss Ellen.
798756 801090 It's all right, Pork. I'm home.
801592 805261 Mrs. O'Hara, we finished<br />plowing the creek bottom today.
805471 807972 What do you want me<br />to start on tomorrow?
808182 811768 Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come<br />from Emmie Slattery's bedside.
812019 813436 Your child has been born.
813687 816856 My child, ma'am?<br />I'm sure I don't understand.
817107 820109 Has been born and<br />mercifully has died.
820361 822362 Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
825282 827617 I fix your supper myself<br />and you eats it.
827868 830495 - Yes, after prayers, Mammy.<br />- Yes'm.
831330 834666 Mr. O'Hara, you must<br />dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
834917 838461 Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?<br />He's the best overseer in the county.
838712 841339 He must go tomorrow morning,<br />the first thing!
843259 844759 - No.<br />- Yes.
845553 848263 The Yankee Wilkerson and<br />the white-trash Slattery girl?
848514 851933 - We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.<br />- Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
852768 855520 Scarlett's dress<br />is prettier than mine!
855938 858898 Can't she wear my pink dress?<br />I wanna wear Scarlett's green dress.
859149 862235 I don't like your tone, Suellen.<br />Your pink gown's lovely.
862486 865363 Can't I stay up for the ball?<br />- You may wear my garnets.
865614 868241 Why can't I stay up for<br />the ball tomorrow?
868492 873454 Scarlett. You look tired, my dear.<br />I'm worried about you.
873706 875123 I'm all right, Mother.
875332 878668 Why can't I stay up for the ball?<br />I'm 13 now.
879169 881212 You may go to the barbecue.
881463 883673 I didn't want your tacky dress anyhow!
883924 886593 - Hush up!<br />Prayers, girls.
893017 897896 - and to all the saints, that I have<br />sinned in thought, word and deed...
898147 903109 ...through my fault, through my fault,<br />through my most grievous fault.
903360 906613 Therefore, I beseech thee,<br />blessed Mary, ever virgin...
906822 909032 ...blessed Michael the Archangel...
909283 911034 ...blessed John the Baptist...
911285 915496 ...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul,<br />and all the saints...
915748 917081 ...pray to the Lord...
917291 919542 Ashley doesn't know I love him.
920544 922420 I'll tell him that I love him...
922630 924964 ...and then he can't marry.
925591 928301 Hear thee Almighty,<br />most merciful Lord...
928510 932972 ...grant us pardon, absolution<br />and remission of our sins. Amen.
935267 938519 Just hold on and suck in!
938729 941022 Mammy, here's<br />Miss Scarlett's vittles.
941273 943775 Take it back to the kitchen.<br />I won't eat a bite.
944026 945360 Yes'm, you is!
945611 947528 You's gonna eat every mouthful.
948197 951449 No, I'm not!
953452 955411 Put on the dress.<br />We're late already.
955621 957330 - What my lamb gonna wear?<br />- That.
957581 961459 No, you ain't! You can't show<br />your bosom before 3:00!
961835 963586 I'm gonna speak to your ma!
963837 966923 If you say one word to mother,<br />I won't eat a bite.
970552 971719 Well...
978727 982188 Keep your shawl on. I ain't<br />aiming for you to get freckled...
982398 986901 ...after the buttermilk I done put<br />on you, bleaching them freckles.
992950 997745 Now, Miss Scarlett. You come on<br />and be good and eat just a little, honey.
997955 1001791 No! I'm going to have a good time<br />today and eat at the barbecue.
1002042 1004794 If you don't care<br />what folks says, I does!
1005004 1010133 You can always tell a lady by how<br />she eats in front of folks like a bird.
1010426 1014637 I ain't aiming for you to go to<br />John Wilkes' and gobble like a hog!
1014847 1016347 Fiddle-dee-dee!
1016598 1019892 Ashley told me he likes<br />girls with a healthy appetite.
1020144 1022812 What gentlemens says<br />and thinks is different things.
1023063 1026024 And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley<br />asking for to marry you.
1042166 1046753 Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need<br />a having it come right back up again.
1048672 1051591 Why is it a girl has to be<br />so silly to catch a husband?
1051842 1055720 Scarlett O'Hara! If you're not<br />down here by the time I count 10...
1055929 1058056 - ... we'll go without you!<br />- I'm coming, Pa!
1058307 1063436 One, two, three, four, five...
1064938 1066147 Oh, dear!
1066356 1070735 My stays are so tight, I'll never<br />get through the day without belching!
1094885 1096427 Well, John Wilkes.
1096678 1099931 - It's a grand day for the barbecue.<br />- So it seems, Gerald.
1100140 1101808 Why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
1102059 1105603 She's settling accounts with the overseer,<br />but she'll be along tonight.
1105813 1109482 - Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.<br />- Thank you kindly, India.
1109691 1112819 Your daughter's getting<br />prettier every day, John.
1113028 1115905 Here are the O'Hara girls.<br />We must greet them.
1116156 1119367 I can't stand Scarlett.<br />She throws herself at Ashley.
1119701 1121244 That's your brother's business.
1121453 1123913 You must remember<br />your duties as hostess.
1124123 1126666 Good morning, girls.<br />You're looking lovely.
1126917 1128709 Good morning, Scarlett.
1129336 1132046 India Wilkes,<br />what a lovely dress!
1132256 1134966 I just can't take my eyes off it.
1135551 1137468 Good morning, Miss Scarlett.
1138178 1141222 You look mighty fine<br />this morning, Miss Scarlett.
1143183 1145601 It's a pleasure to see you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1148105 1149564 Ashley!
1151441 1154152 Scarlett, my dear!
1154653 1156654 I've been looking for you everywhere.
1156864 1160616 I've got something I must tell you.<br />Can't we go someplace quiet?
1160826 1164412 Yes, I'd like to, but I have<br />something to tell you too.
1164663 1168249 Something I hope<br />you'll be glad to hear.
1168500 1170626 Come say hello<br />to my cousin Melanie first.
1170878 1172503 Oh, do we have to?
1172754 1176507 She's been looking forward<br />to seeing you again. Melanie!
1177968 1181429 Here's Scarlett.<br />- Scarlett!
1182472 1184015 I'm so glad to see you again.
1184266 1186934 Melanie, what a surprise<br />to run into you here.
1187144 1189395 I hope you'll stay with us a few days.
1189646 1193107 I hope I shall stay long enough<br />for us to become real friends.
1193317 1196110 - I do want us to be.<br />- We'll keep her here, won't we?
1196570 1199030 We'll make the biggest fuss over her!
1199281 1202033 If anybody can give a girl<br />a good time, it's Ashley.
1202284 1205536 Our good times must seem silly<br />to you. You're so serious.
1205829 1208497 Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
1208707 1211834 I've always admired you.<br />I wish I could be more like you.
1212085 1214879 You mustn't flatter me<br />and say things you don't mean.
1215130 1218674 Nobody could accuse Melanie<br />of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
1218884 1220927 She's not like you, is she, Ashley?
1221136 1223429 He never means a word<br />he says to any girl.
1224139 1227391 Why, Charles Hamilton,<br />you handsome old thing, you!
1227643 1229060 But, Miss O'Hara, I-
1229311 1234148 Was it kind to bring your good-looking<br />brother here to break my poor heart?
1234399 1238653 Now that Charles is your beau,<br />she's after him like a hornet.
1238904 1241197 Charles, I want to eat<br />barbecue with you.
1241448 1245034 Don't go philandering with any other girl,<br />because I'm mighty jealous.
1245285 1248621 I won't, Miss O'Hara.<br />I couldn't!
1248872 1252917 I do declare, Frank Kennedy! You look<br />dashing with those new whiskers.
1253168 1255544 Thank you, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
1256004 1261092 Charles and Wade asked me to eat with<br />them, but I told them I promised you.
1261343 1265137 You needn't be so amused.<br />She's after your beau now.
1265389 1268307 That's mighty flattering of you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1268558 1270559 I'll see what I can do.
1270811 1273312 Why's your sister mad?<br />You sparking her beau?
1273522 1276399 As if I couldn't do better<br />than that old maid in britches.
1276650 1279026 Brent and Stuart,<br />you handsome old things!
1279278 1282446 - I didn't mean it. I'm mad at you!<br />- What have we done?
1282698 1286242 You haven't been near me all day!<br />I wore this old dress for you.
1286451 1288286 I was counting on eating with you.
1288537 1291205 - You are, Scarlett.<br />- Of course you are, honey.
1291415 1294959 I never can make up my mind<br />which of you is the handsomest.
1295210 1298587 I was awake all last night<br />trying to figure it out.
1298797 1300381 Oh, shucks!
1303927 1306595 - Cathleen, who's that?<br />- Who?
1306805 1308973 That man looking at us and smiling.
1309224 1310349 The nasty dark one.
1310600 1314520 Don't you know? That's Rhett Butler.<br />He's from Charleston.
1314771 1317273 He has a most terrible reputation.
1321653 1325614 He looks as if he knows<br />what I look like without my shimmy.
1326533 1328367 My dear, he isn't received.
1328618 1332496 He spends his time up North<br />because his folks won't speak to him.
1332706 1334999 He was expelled<br />from West Point, he's so fast.
1335208 1338252 And there's that business<br />about the girl he wouldn't marry.
1338503 1339587 Tell, tell!
1339796 1344842 He took her out buggy-riding in<br />the late afternoon without a chaperon...
1345385 1348137 ...and then he refused to marry her!
1350640 1354185 No, but she was ruined just the same.
1358940 1360358 Ashley...
1360567 1363569 - Happy?<br />- So happy.
1364696 1366697 You seem to belong here...
1366990 1369617 ...as if it had all been<br />imagined for you.
1370911 1373245 I like to feel that I belong<br />to the things you love.
1373455 1376374 - You love Twelve Oaks as I do.<br />- Yes, Ashley.
1376583 1380252 I love it as more than a house.
1380462 1384215 It's a whole world that wants only<br />to be graceful and beautiful.
1384466 1388302 It's so unaware<br />that it may not last forever.
1388553 1391722 You're afraid of what may happen<br />if the war comes?
1391932 1394892 But we don't have to be afraid for us.
1395102 1398396 No war can come into our world, Ashley.
1398647 1401732 Whatever comes, I'll love you...
1401983 1406112 ...just as I do now, until I die.
1410117 1411951 Isn’t this better than a table?
1412202 1415079 A girl hasn't got but two sides<br />to her at a table.
1415956 1417998 - I'll get her dessert.<br />- She said me!
1418208 1419458 Allow me, Miss O'Hara?
1421837 1423838 I think...
1426299 1428843 I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
1430804 1434140 Thank you, Miss O'Hara.<br />Thank you!
1434349 1437393 Go get it, boy!<br />Isn’t he the luckiest...
1445110 1446777 Miss O'Hara...
1447696 1449280 ...I love you.
1450323 1453033 I don't guess I'm as hungry<br />as I thought.
1456121 1458914 Why do I have to take a nap?<br />I'm not tired.
1459166 1461375 Well-brought-up ladies<br />takes naps at parties.
1461585 1465254 It's time you behave and act<br />like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
1465505 1469425 When we were in Saratoga,<br />I didn't see Yankee girls taking naps.
1469634 1472887 And you won't see no Yankee<br />girls at the ball, neither.
1473138 1474555 How was Ashley today?
1474806 1477266 He didn't pay much attention to you.
1477517 1478976 You mind your own business!
1479227 1481604 You'll be lucky you don't lose<br />whisker-face Kennedy.
1481813 1485357 You're sweet on Ashley, and his<br />engagement's being announced tonight.
1485567 1487443 That's as much as you know.
1487861 1492281 You ought to behave yourself!<br />Acting like poor white-trash children!
1492491 1495326 If you's old enough for parties,<br />you should act like ladies!
1495535 1497119 Who cares?
1548129 1550464 We've borne enough insults<br />from the Yankees.
1550715 1554802 We'll keep our slaves<br />with or without their approval.
1555053 1558597 'Twas the sovereign right of<br />Georgia to secede from the Union.
1558807 1561600 The South must assert herself<br />by force of arms.
1561851 1565980 After we've fired on the Yankee rascals<br />at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight.
1566231 1568399 - There's no other way.<br />That's right!
1568650 1570526 Let the Yankees ask for peace.
1570777 1575114 The situation's very simple.<br />The Yankees can't fight and we can.
1575323 1577992 There won't be a battle.<br />They'll turn and run.
1578243 1582079 One of us can lick 20 Yanks.<br />We'll beat them in one battle.
1582330 1584665 Gentlemen can always fight<br />better than rabble.
1584833 1586208 Gentlemen always fight better.
1586459 1588794 What does the captain<br />of our Troop say?
1589045 1593215 Well, gentlemen,<br />if Georgia fights, I go with her.
1593466 1596510 I hope the Yankees let us<br />leave the Union in peace.
1596678 1598220 Ashley, they've insulted us!
1598471 1600306 You can't mean you don't want war?
1600473 1603684 Most of the miseries of the world<br />were caused by wars.
1603893 1608814 And when the wars were over,<br />no one ever knew what they were about.
1610108 1613527 Now, gentlemen. Mr. Butler's<br />been up North, I hear.
1613778 1615154 Don't you agree with us?
1616364 1618866 I think it's hard winning<br />a war with words.
1619117 1620326 What do you mean, sir?
1620577 1623078 There's not a cannon factory<br />in the whole South.
1623246 1625289 What difference does that make<br />to a gentleman?
1625540 1628459 It'll make a great difference<br />to a great many gentlemen, sir.
1628710 1631420 Are you hinting<br />that the Yankees can lick us?
1631671 1632796 No, I'm not hinting.
1633048 1635758 I'm saying plainly, the Yankees<br />are better equipped than we.
1636009 1638177 They've got factories,<br />shipyards, coal mines...
1638386 1641138 ...and a fleet to bottle up<br />our harbors and starve us.
1641389 1644933 All we've got is cotton and slaves,<br />and arrogance.
1645185 1647853 I refuse to listen<br />to any renegade talk!
1648438 1652399 - I'm sorry if the truth offends you.<br />- Apologies aren't enough, sir.
1652567 1655235 I hear you were turned out<br />of West Point, Mr. Rhett Butler.
1655528 1658072 And you aren't received in<br />any family in Charleston.
1658323 1659490 Not even your own!
1664454 1667623 I apologize again<br />for all my shortcomings.
1668917 1671585 Perhaps you won't mind if<br />I look over your place?
1671795 1675172 I seem to be spoiling everybody's<br />brandy and cigars...
1675423 1677174 ...and dreams of victory.
1683890 1687351 That's what you can expect<br />from somebody like Rhett Butler.
1687602 1689311 You did everything but call him out.
1689562 1691814 - He refused to fight.<br />- Not quite there, Charles.
1692065 1694733 - He refused to take advantage of you.<br />- Take advantage of me?
1694901 1698028 He's one of the best shots in the country,<br />as he's proved many times.
1698196 1700906 - He's got steadier hands than yours.<br />- Well, I'll show him!
1701074 1703617 Please. Don't go tweaking<br />his nose anymore.
1703910 1706829 You may be needed for more<br />important fighting.
1707038 1709331 If you'll excuse me,<br />Mr. Butler's our guest.
1709541 1711834 I think I'll just show him around.
1724347 1725639 Ashley!
1733481 1734606 Ashley...
1735024 1736316 Scarlett.
1738069 1739987 Who are you hiding from in here?
1745410 1747077 What are you up to?
1749247 1752499 Why aren't you upstairs,<br />resting with the other girls?
1753418 1755294 What is this, Scarlett, a secret?
1755962 1757296 Oh, Ashley...
1757589 1758672 Ashley!
1758923 1761300 - I love you.<br />- Scarlett!
1761551 1763761 I love you, I do!
1765138 1768807 Isn’t it enough that you gathered<br />every other man's heart today?
1769017 1771351 You've always had mine.<br />You cut your teeth on it.
1771603 1772978 Don't tease me now.
1773229 1776064 Have I your heart, my darling?<br />I love you, I love you!
1776316 1778150 You mustn't say such things.
1778401 1780027 You'll hate me for hearing them.
1780236 1783906 I could never hate you,<br />and I know you must care about me.
1784491 1786909 You do care, don't you?
1787786 1790204 Yes, I care.
1792123 1795459 Can't we go away<br />and forget we ever said these things?
1796836 1798587 But how can we do that?
1798755 1801006 Don't you-?<br />Don't you want to marry me?
1801174 1802716 I'm going to marry Melanie.
1802926 1805260 But you can't!<br />Not if you care for me!
1805512 1808806 Oh, my dear, why must you make me<br />say things that will hurt you?
1809474 1811725 How can I make you understand?
1812227 1815103 You're so young, you don't<br />know what marriage means.
1815313 1817689 I know I love you,<br />and I want to be your wife.
1817941 1819358 You don't love Melanie.
1819609 1821151 She's like me, Scarlett.
1821402 1823821 She's my blood<br />and we understand each other.
1824531 1826323 But you love me!
1826533 1828408 How could I help loving you?
1828618 1830911 You have all the passion<br />for life that I lack.
1831412 1835624 That kind of love isn't enough<br />for two people as different as we are.
1835875 1838877 Why not say it, you coward?<br />You're afraid to marry me.
1839128 1841380 You'd marry that fool<br />who can only say...
1841589 1844967 ..."yes," "no" and raise<br />a passel of mealy-mouthed brats!
1845218 1846343 You mustn't say that!
1846594 1849346 Who are you to tell me I mustn't?<br />You led me on!
1849556 1852599 - You made me believe you'd marry me.<br />- Scarlett, be fair!
1852809 1855394 - I never at any time-<br />- You did! It's true, you did!
1855603 1857437 I'll hate you till I die!
1857689 1861358 I can't think of anything<br />bad enough to call you!
1888177 1889303 Has the war started?
1890430 1893974 Sir, you should have made<br />your presence known.
1894309 1896518 In the middle of that<br />beautiful love scene?
1896728 1898812 That wouldn't have been tactful,<br />would it?
1899022 1901773 But don't worry.<br />Your secret is safe with me.
1902025 1905777 - Sir, you are no gentleman.<br />- And you, miss, are no lady.
1905987 1909573 I don't hold that against you.<br />Ladies never held any charm for me.
1909824 1912534 First you take advantage of me,<br />then you insult me!
1912785 1914369 I meant it as a compliment.
1914621 1918874 I hope to see more of you, when<br />you're free of the spell of Mr. Wilkes.
1919125 1922210 He doesn't strike me as good<br />enough for a girl of your-
1922462 1925088 What was it?<br />Your "passion for living. "
1925340 1927674 How dare you!<br />You aren't fit to wipe his boots!
1929719 1932804 And you were going to hate him<br />for the rest of your life.
1934766 1938685 She certainly made a fool<br />of herself running after all the men.
1938937 1940354 That's not fair, India.
1940605 1943482 She's so attractive,<br />men naturally flock to her.
1943650 1945817 Melanie, you're just too good to be true.
1946069 1949696 - Didn't you see her going after Charles?<br />- And she knows Charles belongs to me.
1949948 1951406 You're wrong, India.
1951658 1954743 Scarlett's just high-spirited<br />and vivacious.
1955203 1957955 Men flirt with girls like that,<br />but they don't marry them.
1958122 1960749 I think you're being very mean to her.
1983064 1984982 Miss O'Hara!
1987819 1989027 Miss O'Hara!
1989278 1992280 Mr. Lincoln's called volunteers<br />to fight against us!
1992490 1994992 Don't you men think<br />about anything important?
1995201 1999079 But it's war! Everybody's going off<br />to enlist. I'm going too!
1999288 2000998 Everybody?
2004627 2007295 Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
2007547 2008797 To see us go?
2009007 2011633 I'll cry into my pillow every night.
2011843 2013593 Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
2013803 2018140 You're the most beautiful girl in the world,<br />and the sweetest, the dearest.
2018391 2020642 I couldn't hope that you could love me.
2020893 2024312 I'm so clumsy and stupid<br />and not nearly good enough for you.
2024564 2028191 But if you could think of marrying me,<br />I'd do anything in the world for you.
2028359 2029526 Just anything, I promise.
2030403 2031445 What did you say?
2031696 2035198 Miss O'Hara, I said,<br />"Would you marry me?"
2040288 2042706 Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
2042915 2045459 You will? You'll marry me?<br />You'll wait for me?
2045668 2049379 - I don't think I'd want to wait.<br />- You'll marry me before I go?
2049797 2053216 Oh, Miss O'Hara! Scarlett.
2055303 2057929 - When may I speak to your father?<br />- The sooner the better.
2058139 2062517 I'll go now, I can't wait.<br />Will you excuse me, dear?
2064228 2065645 Dear!
2066522 2068398 Mr. O'Hara! Mr. O'Hara!
2068649 2072944 - It'll be a week before they call me.<br />- A week till they take you away from me!
2091881 2094633 Oh, Ashley.
2106604 2109106 I thought of you<br />at our wedding yesterday...
2109315 2111566 ...and I hoped yours<br />would be as beautiful.
2111818 2114444 - And it was!<br />- Was it?
2114654 2117489 Now we're really and truly sisters.
2117740 2119199 - Charles!<br />- Melanie.
2127125 2128416 Don't cry, darling.
2128626 2133004 The war will be over in a few weeks,<br />and I'll be coming back to you.
2176591 2178466 Miss Scarlett!
2178718 2181803 I don't care!<br />I'm too young to be a widow.
2182013 2183388 Miss Scarlett!
2185099 2188518 Why, I'd just go around<br />scaring people in that thing.
2188769 2191188 You shouldn't be around people.<br />You's in mourning!
2191397 2194149 For what? I don't feel anything.
2194358 2197319 Why should I have to<br />pretend and pretend?
2197737 2199654 What is it?
2199822 2203074 Oh, poor baby!
2203492 2204534 What is it?
2204744 2206411 My life is over!
2206662 2210790 - Nothing will ever happen to me anymore!<br />- Darling...
2211667 2214794 Oh, Mother,<br />I know you think I'm horrible.
2215046 2217505 But I just can't bear<br />going around in black.
2217757 2221843 It's bad enough not being able to<br />go to parties. But looking this way too?
2222094 2223762 I don't think you're at all horrible.
2224013 2228350 It's only natural you want to look young<br />and be young when you are young.
2228601 2230852 Oh, baby!
2231103 2234356 How would you like to visit somewhere?<br />Savannah, perhaps?
2234565 2237317 What would I do in Savannah?
2237526 2240820 Well, Atlanta then.<br />There's lots going on there.
2241030 2244157 And you can stay with Melanie<br />and her Aunt Pittypat.
2244825 2246201 Melanie?
2246452 2247577 Yes.
2248204 2249412 Yes, I could, couldn't I?
2249664 2252749 Oh, Mother, you're sweeter<br />than anybody in the world!
2253000 2254417 You'd like it, really?
2254669 2258964 All right, then.<br />Now stop your crying and smile.
2259632 2261841 You can take Prissy with you.
2262051 2264427 Start packing<br />Miss Scarlett's things, Mammy.
2264679 2267305 I'll go write the necessary letters.
2269642 2270684 Atlanta!
2270935 2274312 Savannah would be better for you.<br />You'll get in trouble in Atlanta.
2274563 2275772 What are you talking about?
2276023 2279401 You know what I's talking about.<br />I'm talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.
2279610 2283905 He'll come to Atlanta for his leave<br />and you waiting for him just like a spider!
2284156 2287742 - He belongs to Miss Melanie-<br />- Go pack my things like Mother said!
2308472 2311224 They're all whispering,<br />and I know it's about her!
2311475 2313518 What's it matter, Pittypat?
2313769 2317689 Scarlett's living under my roof,<br />so they think I'm responsible for her.
2317940 2321776 And for a widow to appear in public<br />at a social gathering...
2322028 2324654 ...every time I think of it, I feel faint.
2324864 2329034 You know Scarlett came here<br />only to help raise money for the Cause.
2329243 2332203 It was splendid of her<br />to make the sacrifice.
2332455 2337584 Anyone hearing you talk would think<br />she came to dance instead of sell things.
2349972 2354851 Ladies and gentlemen,<br />I have important news! Glorious news!
2355102 2358646 Another triumph<br />for our magnificent men in arms!
2358856 2361816 General Lee has completely<br />whipped the enemy...
2362068 2366071 ...and swept the Yankee army<br />northward from Virginia!
2375206 2378500 And now, a happy surprise<br />for all of us.
2378751 2383171 We have with us tonight, that most<br />daring of all blockade runners...
2383422 2386716 ...whose fleet schooners,<br />slipping past the Yankee guns...
2386967 2390929 ...have brought us here the very<br />woolens and laces we wear tonight.
2391180 2395183 I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that<br />will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main.
2395434 2398061 None other than our friend<br />from Charleston...
2398312 2400063 ...Captain Rhett Butler!
2420793 2422252 Permit me.
2426507 2429801 Captain Butler, such a pleasure<br />to see you again.
2430052 2431886 I met you last at my husband's home.
2432138 2434597 That's kind of you to remember,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2434849 2437392 Did you meet Captain Butler<br />at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
2437643 2439727 Yes, I- I think so.
2439979 2442313 Only for a moment.<br />It was in the library.
2442565 2444816 You had broken something.
2445651 2448111 Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
2448279 2452073 Ladies, the Confederacy asks for your<br />jewelry on behalf of our noble Cause.
2452324 2454367 We aren't wearing any.<br />We're in mourning.
2454618 2455910 Wait.
2456120 2459289 On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br />and Mrs. Hamilton.
2459582 2460874 Thank you, Captain Butler.
2461125 2463460 Just a moment, please.
2465629 2467839 But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
2468048 2471718 It may help my husband more<br />off my finger.
2471969 2473470 Thank you.
2475389 2477557 That was a very beautiful thing to do.
2478642 2479767 Here.
2480019 2482395 You can have mine too.<br />For the Cause.
2484815 2488443 And you, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />I know just how much that means to you.
2488611 2489652 Melanie?
2489904 2492071 - Dr. Meade?<br />- I need your approval...
2492281 2495200 ...for something we want to do<br />that's rather shocking.
2495868 2497285 Will you excuse us?
2499914 2503541 I'll say one thing. The war makes<br />the most peculiar widows.
2503709 2504792 I wish you'd go away!
2505044 2508296 If you had any raising, you'd know<br />I'd never want to see you again!
2511175 2512509 Now, why be silly?
2512760 2514344 You've no reason for hating me.
2514595 2517680 I'll carry your guilty secret<br />to my grave.
2518557 2522268 I'd be very unpatriotic to hate<br />a great hero of the war.
2522478 2525813 I declare, I was surprised you<br />turned out to be a noble character.
2526023 2529359 I can't bear to take advantage<br />of your little-girl ideas.
2529610 2531694 I'm neither noble nor heroic.
2531946 2535657 - But you are a blockade runner?<br />- For profit, and profit only.
2535866 2537617 You don't believe in the Cause?
2537868 2542038 Rhett Butler is the only cause I know.<br />The rest doesn't mean much to me.
2545501 2547293 And now, ladies and gentlemen...
2547545 2550505 ...I have a startling surprise<br />for the benefit of the hospital.
2552550 2556511 Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the reel<br />with the lady of your choice...
2556720 2558096 ...you must bid for her!
2560099 2564644 Caroline Meade, how can you let your<br />husband conduct this slave auction!
2564895 2567605 Darlene Merriwether,<br />how dare you criticize me!
2567815 2572193 Melanie told the doctor that<br />if it's for the Cause, it's quite all right.
2572361 2573403 She did?
2573654 2576906 Oh, dear! Oh, dear!<br />Where are my smelling salts?
2577116 2580743 - I think I shall faint.<br />- Don't you dare faint, Pittypat!
2580953 2584539 If Melanie says it's all right,<br />it is all right.
2584790 2587792 Come, gentlemen,<br />do I hear your bids? Make your offers!
2588460 2590461 Don't be bashful, gentlemen!
2590963 2595216 Twenty dollars! Twenty dollars<br />for Miss Maybelle Merriwether!
2595467 2597343 Twenty-five dollars<br />for Miss Fanny Elsing!
2597595 2599262 Only $25 to give your-
2599513 2603391 - One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.<br />- For what lady, sir?
2603642 2605393 For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2608522 2611524 - For whom, sir?<br />- Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2611775 2613735 Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning.
2613986 2616738 But I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles<br />would be proud to-
2616947 2619991 Dr. Meade, I said<br />Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2620868 2622535 She will not consider it, sir.
2623412 2624829 Oh, yes, I will!
2627249 2629667 My goodness gracious!
2637426 2639594 Choose your partners<br />for the Virginia reel!
2641305 2643056 We've shocked the Confederacy.
2643307 2645099 It's like blockade running, isn't it?
2645309 2648436 It's worse. I expect<br />a very fancy profit out of it.
2648646 2651689 I don't care what you expect.<br />I'm gonna dance and dance!
2651940 2655526 Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing<br />with Abe Lincoln himself!
2686892 2689310 Another dance and my reputation<br />will be lost forever.
2689478 2691813 With enough courage<br />you can do without a reputation.
2692022 2693981 Oh, you do talk scandalous!
2701699 2704158 You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
2704410 2708121 Don't start flirting with me.<br />I'm not one of your plantation beaus.
2708372 2710331 I want more than flirting from you.
2711083 2712917 What do you want?
2713168 2718131 I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take<br />that Southern belle simper off your face.
2718382 2722677 Someday I want you to say to me the<br />words I heard you say to Ashley Wilkes.
2723137 2724679 "I love you. "
2724930 2728725 That's something you'll never hear<br />from me as long as you live.
2749037 2753791 How sweet. How kind.<br />He is a thoughtful gentleman.
2754042 2757920 Why doesn't he say<br />something about my sacrifice?
2765721 2767472 Oh, the darling thing!
2767681 2769724 Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely!
2769975 2772935 You didn't really bring it<br />all the way from Paris just for me.
2773145 2777023 Yes, I thought it was about time<br />I got you out of that fake mourning.
2777191 2780109 Next trip I'll bring you some<br />green silk for a frock to match it.
2780277 2782737 - Oh, Rhett.<br />- It's my duty to our...
2782988 2787366 ...brave boys at the front to<br />keep our girls at home looking pretty.
2787618 2789827 It's so long since I had anything new!
2800339 2802089 How do I look?
2802633 2804425 Awful! Just awful!
2804676 2806052 Why? What's the matter?
2806303 2810681 This war's stopped being a joke when<br />a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.
2816188 2819649 Oh, Rhett! Let me do it.
2824112 2827824 But, Rhett, I don't know<br />how I'd dare wear it!
2828075 2829659 You will, though.
2830035 2832411 And another thing, those pantalets!
2832621 2835331 I don't know a woman in Paris<br />who wears pantalets anymore.
2835582 2839210 What do they-? You shouldn't<br />talk about such things.
2839419 2843047 You don't mind my knowing about them,<br />just my talking about them.
2843257 2846801 I can't go on accepting these gifts,<br />though you're awfully kind.
2847052 2848845 I'm not kind. I'm tempting you.
2849054 2852765 I never give without expecting<br />something in return. I always get paid.
2852975 2855142 I won't marry you<br />to pay for the bonnet.
2855394 2858479 Don't flatter yourself.<br />I'm not a marrying man.
2858730 2861566 Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
2871660 2873870 Open your eyes and look at me.
2874872 2876706 No, I don't think I will kiss you.
2876874 2878416 Although you need kissing, badly.
2878584 2881377 That's what's wrong with you.<br />You should be kissed, and often.
2881587 2883004 And by someone who knows how.
2883171 2885548 And I suppose you think<br />you're the proper person!
2885799 2888926 I might be, if the right moment<br />ever came.
2889136 2891846 You're a conceited,<br />black-hearted varmint!
2892097 2894515 I don't know why<br />I let you come and see me.
2894975 2896309 I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
2896560 2901022 I'm the only man over 16 and under 60<br />who's around to show you a good time.
2901273 2903816 But cheer up.<br />The war can't last much longer.
2904067 2905693 Really, Rhett? Why?
2905944 2908905 There's a battle going on now<br />that ought to fix things...
2909114 2910781 - ... one way or the other.<br />- Oh, Rhett.
2911033 2912658 Is Ashley in it?
2913785 2917038 So you haven't gotten the wooden-headed<br />Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
2917289 2920625 - Yes, I suppose he's in it.<br />- But tell me, where is it?
2920876 2924754 Some little town in Pennsylvania<br />called Gettysburg.
2953617 2956661 Casualty lists! Casualty lists!
2961416 2964377 Please! Please!
3005460 3009338 Here you is. They was fighting<br />for them so, it got tore in half.
3009589 3011090 Scarlett, you look.
3011341 3013009 The W's at the end.
3016388 3021308 Wellman, Wendel, White, Whitman,<br />Wilkens, Williams, Woolsey, Wortman-
3021518 3024437 Scarlett, you've passed him!
3024646 3027189 He isn't there! He isn't there!
3027441 3029650 Ashley's safe, he isn't listed!
3029901 3032987 Oh, he's safe. He's safe!
3034197 3039035 Scarlett, you're so sweet to worry<br />about Ashley like this for me.
3045167 3047376 I must go to her.
3048253 3050796 Don't, my dear. Not here.
3051006 3052798 Let's go home.
3053675 3055301 Dr. Meade, not-?
3055510 3058679 Yes, our boy Darcy.
3058930 3061974 I was making these mittens for him.
3062225 3064477 He won't need them now.
3065103 3066395 Well, I'm gonna enlist.
3066646 3068856 I'll show them!<br />I'll kill those Yankees!
3069066 3070149 You hush your mouth.
3070400 3074570 You think it'll help your mother<br />to have you shot too? It's silly!
3077407 3078866 It's a black day, Scarlett.
3079117 3080534 Haven't had bad news, have you?
3080744 3083704 - Ashley's safe.<br />- I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
3083955 3085247 There are so many others.
3085499 3088250 - Any of your friends?<br />- About every family in the county.
3088460 3090961 - The Tarleton boys, both of them.<br />- Yes.
3091671 3094507 Look at them.<br />All these poor tragic people.
3094758 3098719 The South's sinking to its knees.<br />It'll never rise again.
3098970 3100262 The Cause.
3100514 3103724 The cause of living in the past<br />is dying right in front of us.
3103975 3105810 I never heard you talk like that.
3106019 3110981 I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry<br />and that's what this is, sheer waste!
3112400 3113984 But don't you be downcast.
3114277 3117863 Ashley's still alive to come home<br />to the women who love him.
3118073 3119532 Both of them.
3156236 3157528 You're here!
3161199 3164493 Oh, you're here!<br />You're really here at last!
3164744 3166662 Oh, my dear, I've waited so long!
3166913 3169123 Melanie, my dear, my darling wife!
3173170 3175421 But we're forgetting Scarlett.
3176464 3178549 Scarlett, dear.
3180510 3184430 Why, is this any way to greet<br />a returning warrior?
3184681 3186265 Ashley, I...
3186641 3188350 I...
3189394 3191687 Merry Christmas, Ashley.
3199696 3203365 Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br />We's ate all your wives.
3204159 3205910 We's ate all your little chicks.
3206161 3208787 You got nobody to worry<br />your head about leaving.
3209831 3212958 Come on. Now you just<br />stand still so you...
3213168 3215252 ...can be Christmas<br />for the white folks.
3215503 3217213 Now, hold on!
3217756 3219173 Hold on!
3219382 3220966 Don't go getting so uppity.
3221593 3224637 Even if you is the last chicken<br />in Atlanta.
3226556 3228641 Let's not talk about the war.
3228892 3232478 Let's talk Twelve Oaks and Tara<br />and times before there was a war.
3232729 3234021 Could we have the wine?
3234231 3236523 Why did you say there<br />wasn't enough?
3236816 3240319 There's plenty. It's the very last<br />of my father's fine Madeira.
3240528 3244281 He got it from his uncle<br />Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
3244532 3247993 ...who married his cousin<br />Jessica Carroll of Carrolton...
3248203 3251580 ...who was his second cousin<br />and akin to the Wilkeses too.
3251831 3255626 I saved it to wish Ashley<br />a merry Christmas.
3256002 3261131 But you mustn't drink it all at once,<br />because it is the last.
3264552 3267388 I meant it, my dear.<br />It was a lovely Christmas gift.
3267639 3269807 Only generals have tunics like this.
3270058 3271684 I'm so happy you like it.
3271935 3273477 Where did you get the cloth?
3273728 3275729 It was sent by a Charleston lady.
3275981 3280317 I nursed her son while he was<br />in the hospital before he died and-
3280819 3283237 You will take good care of it, won't you?
3283446 3286782 You won't let it get torn.<br />Promise me.
3287033 3288450 You mustn't worry.
3288702 3292830 I'll bring it back to you<br />without any holes in it. I promise.
3295125 3298460 Good night, my dear.<br />- Good night, Scarlett, darling.
3311474 3313726 Uncle Peter, is it time<br />for Mr. Ashley to leave?
3313977 3315561 Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
3315770 3319315 Melanie isn't going to the depot?<br />She hasn't changed her mind?
3319482 3320941 No, ma'am, she's laying down.
3321151 3325779 She's so upset, Mr. Wilkes told her<br />she can't even come downstairs.
3331745 3332953 Ashley...
3337083 3339752 Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
3340128 3343297 Scarlett, I'd rather remember<br />you as you are now.
3343548 3345799 Not shivering at the depot.
3346092 3347468 All right.
3347761 3351221 Ashley, I've got a present for you too!
3357645 3360189 Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful!
3360398 3362691 Tie it on me, my dear.
3363485 3367488 While Melly was making a new tunic,<br />I made this to go with it.
3367739 3369782 You made it yourself?
3369991 3372701 Well, then I shall<br />value it all the more.
3373370 3376455 You know there's nothing<br />I wouldn't do for you.
3377165 3378957 There's something you can do for me.
3379209 3380459 What is it?
3380710 3383128 Will you look after Melanie for me?
3383755 3387424 She's so frail and gentle,<br />and she loves you so much.
3387675 3390677 - If I were killed-<br />- You mustn't say that! It's bad luck.
3390929 3392554 Say a prayer, quickly.
3392806 3394807 You say one for me.
3395308 3398685 We shall need all our prayers.<br />Now the end is coming.
3398937 3401688 - The end?<br />- The end of the war...
3402315 3404817 ...and the end of our world, Scarlett.
3405527 3408362 But you don't think<br />the Yankees are beating us?
3408530 3412199 Oh, Scarlett,<br />my men are barefooted now!
3412409 3415244 And the snow in Virginia's deep.
3415537 3419623 When I see them, and I see<br />the Yankees coming and coming...
3419874 3422960 ...always more and more!
3424796 3427047 When the end does come,<br />I shall be far away.
3428550 3431301 It'll be a comfort to me<br />to know that she has you.
3432095 3435055 You will promise, won't you?
3436724 3438142 Yes.
3439102 3441645 Is that all, Ashley?
3441896 3444898 All except... goodbye.
3445150 3446650 Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go!
3446901 3449903 - You must be brave. You must!<br />- No, no!
3450155 3452364 How else can I bear going?
3453032 3457578 Oh, Scarlett! You're so fine<br />and strong and beautiful.
3458037 3460747 Not just your sweet face, my dear...
3460999 3462583 ...but you.
3466838 3470299 Ashley, kiss me. Kiss me goodbye.
3472343 3474511 Ashley.
3476848 3479850 No, Scarlett. No!<br />- Oh, Ashley, I love you.
3480059 3483061 I've always loved you.<br />I've never loved anyone else.
3483271 3485731 I only married Charles just to hurt you.
3485940 3489067 Ashley, tell me you love me.
3489319 3492196 I'll live on it the rest of my life!
3493490 3495115 Goodbye.
3514511 3517012 When the war's over, Ashley.
3517597 3519723 When the war's over.
3540036 3542371 - and there's a place back home...
3542622 3546792 ...where a wild plum tree<br />comes to flower in the springtime...
3547043 3548961 ...down by the creek, you know.
3549212 3551463 Yes, I know, I know.
3551714 3554883 When we were little,<br />my brother Jeff and I used to-
3555093 3558845 I told you about my brother Jeff,<br />didn't I, ma'am?
3559055 3561974 I know I did. He...
3562183 3565102 We don't know<br />where Jeff is now, ma'am.
3565353 3569064 Since Bull Run,<br />we haven't heard anything and-
3569274 3571400 Please, we must have<br />your temperature now.
3571651 3575988 Just take this in your mouth<br />and not talk anymore. Not just now.
3576239 3579908 Melanie, I'm so tired.<br />I've got to go home.
3580159 3582202 Aren't you tired, Melanie?
3582412 3585372 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3585623 3589084 This might be Ashley...
3589335 3592254 ...and only strangers here<br />to comfort him.
3592463 3594923 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3595758 3597634 They could all be...
3597885 3599720 ...Ashley.
3611357 3615193 I've been waiting one solid hour<br />to speak to you, Mrs. Wilkes.
3615445 3618238 Go on, you trash.<br />Don't you be pestering these ladies.
3618489 3622034 - Don't talk to her.<br />- It's all right. Who are you?
3622243 3623535 My name's Belle Watling.
3623786 3627080 But that don't matter.<br />You think I got no business here.
3627332 3629625 Tell me what you want<br />to see me about.
3629876 3633211 First time I come here, I says,<br />"Belle, you're a nurse. "
3633463 3637507 They didn't want my kind of nursing.<br />They was more than likely right.
3637759 3642054 Then I tried giving them money.<br />My money wasn't good enough either!
3642263 3643639 The old peahens!
3643890 3646516 I know a gentleman who says<br />you're a human being.
3646726 3650228 If you are, which they ain't,<br />you'll take my money for the hospital.
3650480 3653357 What are you doing here?<br />Haven't you been told twice already?
3653608 3655609 This time I'm conversing<br />with Mrs. Wilkes!
3655818 3659821 You might as well take my money.<br />It's good money, even if it is mine.
3660073 3664618 - I'm sure you're very generous.<br />- I'm a Confederate, like everybody else.
3664869 3666370 Of course you are!
3666621 3668664 Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
3668915 3672084 But maybe they ain't<br />as good Christians as you.
3678758 3681593 Look, Mrs. Meade,<br />it's a great deal of money.
3681844 3684179 Ten, 20, 30, 50!

3734856 3737774 "The Lord is my shepherd,<br />I shall not want.
3738067 3741528 He maketh me to lie down<br />in green pastures.
3744532 3746575 He restoreth my soul.
3746826 3750704 He leadeth me in the paths of<br />righteousness for His name's sake.
3750913 3754291 Yea, though I walk through<br />the valley of the shadow of death...
3754542 3757794 ...I will fear no evil,<br />for Thou art with me.
3758045 3760881 Thy rod and Thy staff,<br />they comfort me. "
3761424 3762924 The Yankees!
3763176 3766178 Yankees! Oh, Dr. Meade,<br />they're getting closer.
3766429 3770724 They'll never get into Atlanta.<br />Never get through old Peg Leg Hood.
3771768 3773685 Give me something for the pain!
3774645 3776062 Give me something for the pain!
3776314 3779274 Sorry, son, we haven't<br />got anything to give you.
3780610 3783445 These animals is driving me crazy!

3794081 3799211 - that I never see you<br />and my Pa again.
3800213 3801713 This leg's got to come off.

3804425 3805550 I'm sorry, soldier.
3805760 3809095 - We're all out of chloroform.<br />- We'll operate without it.
3809388 3812057 No, no, you won't!<br />You can't do it.
3812308 3813475 I won't let you do it!
3813684 3816728 Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off.<br />It's gangrene.
3816979 3818814 No! Oh!
3819106 3821650 I haven't seen my family in three days.
3821901 3823944 I'm going home for half an hour.
3824195 3825862 Orderly, give me a lift!
3829951 3832661 Nurse, you can free this bed.
3833079 3834746 Miss Scarlett!
3836374 3837874 Why, Frank Kennedy.
3838084 3840210 Miss Suellen. Is she well?
3840461 3843547 When did they bring you in?<br />Are you bad hurt?
3843798 3846216 - Suellen. Is she-?<br />- She's all right.
3846425 3848385 Dr. Wilson needs you<br />in the operating room.
3848553 3850804 He's gonna take off that leg.<br />Better hurry.
3852682 3854140 I'll be back.
3855476 3860021 No! You leave me alone! Don't!
3860273 3863024 I can't stand it! No, don't!
3863192 3866695 Don't cut! Don't cut!
3866946 3870448 Don't! Don't! Please!
3870700 3872284 Where's the nurse?
3876080 3877539 Dr. Wilson's waiting.
3877790 3880000 Let him wait! I'm going home!<br />I've done enough!
3880251 3883962 I don't want any more men dying<br />and screaming. I don't want any more!
3944941 3946149 Big Sam!
3947068 3949653 Big Sam! Big Sam!
3950363 3952656 Almighty Moses!<br />It's Miss Scarlett!
3952823 3955533 Big Sam! Big Sam.
3955701 3959079 Sam, Elijah, Prophet, Apostle.<br />I'm so glad to see you.
3959246 3961790 Tell me about Tara, about my mother.<br />She didn't write me.
3961999 3963750 - She gone got sick.<br />- Sick?
3964001 3966044 Just a little bit sick, that's all.
3966295 3969172 Your pa went wild when<br />they wouldn't let him fight.
3969423 3973051 He had fits when they took us<br />to dig the ditch for the soldiers.
3973302 3976846 Your ma said the Confederacy needs it.<br />We's digging for the South.
3977098 3979265 - Was there a doctor?<br />We've got to march.
3979517 3981810 Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
3982061 3983645 Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.
3983854 3985730 If you get sick or hurt,<br />let me know.
3985940 3989359 - Goodbye, Miss Scarlett. Goodbye.<br />Goodbye. Goodbye.
4009463 4011923 Scarlett! Scarlett!
4016387 4019639 Climb into this buggy. This is no day<br />for walking. You'll get run over!
4019807 4021266 Oh, Rhett.
4021434 4023351 Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
4025229 4026896 Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
4030443 4034195 Just another of Sherman's calling<br />cards. He'll pay us a visit soon.
4034447 4037157 I gotta get out of here<br />before the Yankees come!
4037408 4038950 Leave your work at the hospital?
4039201 4042954 Or have you had enough of death<br />and lice and men chopped up?
4043205 4045373 I suppose you weren't meant<br />for sick men.
4045624 4049753 Don't talk like that. I'm so scared!<br />I wish I could get out of here.
4049962 4051212 Let's get out together.
4051464 4054382 No use letting the South<br />come down around your ears.
4054633 4057260 There are too many nice places<br />to go and visit.
4057511 4060346 - Mexico, London, Paris-<br />- With you?
4060598 4061806 Yes, ma'am.
4062016 4065310 With a man who understands<br />and admires you for what you are.
4065561 4068563 I figure we belong together,<br />being the same sort.
4068814 4073359 I've been waiting for you to grow up<br />and get Ashley out of your heart.
4073569 4077906 Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to<br />have a baby in another month or so.
4078115 4082327 It'll be hard loving a man with<br />a wife and baby clinging to him.
4084455 4088541 Well, here we are. Are you going<br />with me or are you getting out?
4088793 4090543 I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler.
4090711 4093004 I'll hate and despise you till I die!
4094632 4097717 Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett.<br />Not that long.
4104809 4106184 Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
4106435 4110063 Folks is all going to Macon,<br />and folks is running away!
4110314 4113566 I can't bear those cannonballs<br />right in my ears!
4113776 4116069 I faint every time I hear one.
4116904 4119197 Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk.
4119406 4121741 - You aren't leaving?<br />- I may be a coward...
4121992 4127038 ...but oh, dear! Yankees in Georgia!<br />How did they ever get in?
4127289 4129874 I'm going too.<br />Prissy, go pack my things.
4130126 4131543 Wait, I won't be a minute.
4131710 4134212 - Do you really think you ought to?<br />Scarlett!
4134922 4137799 What is this?<br />You ain't planning on running away?
4138050 4141219 Don't try to stop me.<br />I'm never going back to that hospital.
4141470 4144264 I've had enough of smelling death,<br />of rot and death.
4144515 4147851 I'm going home! I want my mother.<br />My mother needs me.
4148102 4150270 Listen to me! You must stay here.
4150521 4153231 Without a chaperon?<br />It simply isn't-
4153482 4156151 Good heavens, this is war,<br />not a garden party!
4156402 4159028 - Melanie needs you.<br />- Oh, bother Melanie!
4159238 4162407 She's ill already. She shouldn't<br />even be having a baby.
4162658 4164284 Can't we take her along?
4164535 4169164 Want her to be jounced over rough roads<br />and have the baby ahead of time?
4169415 4172000 It isn't my baby.<br />You take care of her!
4172251 4175503 We haven't enough doctors<br />to look after a sick woman.
4175754 4177005 You've got to stay.
4177256 4180008 What for? I don't know anything<br />about babies being born.
4180259 4183052 I knows! I knows!<br />I knows how to do it.
4183304 4186222 I's done it lots and lots.<br />Let me, doctor. Let me.
4186432 4190768 - I can do everything.<br />- Good. I'll rely on you to help us.
4190978 4194105 Ashley's fighting in the field.<br />Fighting for the Cause.
4194356 4197233 He may never come back.<br />He may die.
4197484 4200486 Scarlett, we owe him<br />a well-born child.
4200654 4201696 Ashley.
4201864 4204324 If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
4204575 4207410 I promised Ashley something...
4207620 4209287 Then you'll stay?
4209538 4212624 Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.<br />Scarlett's staying.
4212875 4215585 Go on, Uncle Peter.<br />I don't know what to do.
4216128 4219130 It's like the end of the world!
4219381 4222592 Uncle Peter, my smelling salt!
4229600 4232060 Melanie, Melanie!<br />It's all your fault!
4232311 4234229 I hate you! I hate you!
4234438 4235980 And I hate your baby!
4236273 4240985 If only I hadn't promised Ashley.<br />If only I hadn't promised him!
4270015 4272976 Stop! Stop! Stop! Please, stop.
4273227 4274352 Are the Yankees coming?
4274561 4276104 The army's pulling out.
4276355 4278439 Pulling out and leaving us<br />to the Yankees?
4278691 4283111 Not leaving, evacuating. Before<br />Sherman cuts the McDonough road.
4283362 4284988 It can't be true!
4285197 4286322 What'll I do?
4286573 4290201 Better refugee south, right quick.<br />If you'll excuse me.
4291161 4292412 Prissy!
4293539 4298167 Prissy! Go pack my things and<br />Melanie's too. We're going to Tara.
4298585 4300628 The Yankees are coming!
4302464 4305341 Scarlett! Scarlett!
4305801 4307510 Melly, we're going to-
4309763 4311764 Melly...
4313559 4317729 I'm sorry to be<br />such a bother, Scarlett.
4319440 4321941 It began at daybreak.
4322109 4324110 But- But-
4324486 4326738 But the Yankees are coming.
4327781 4329532 Poor Scarlett.
4329783 4333745 You'd be at Tara now<br />with your mother, wouldn't you?
4333954 4335496 If it weren't for me.
4336290 4340251 Oh, Scarlett, darling.<br />You've been so good to me.
4340502 4343796 No sister could have been sweeter.
4345966 4348593 I've been lying here thinking...
4349094 4351304 ...if I should die...
4352014 4354640 ...will you take my baby?
4356310 4358227 Fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
4358479 4361356 Aren't things bad enough<br />without you talking about dying?
4361607 4364525 - I'll send for Dr. Meade.<br />- Not yet, Scarlett.
4364735 4367570 I couldn't let Dr. Meade<br />sit here for hours...
4368280 4371741 ...while all those poor,<br />wounded boys...
4372034 4374160 Prissy! Prissy, Prissy!
4374411 4375953 Come here, quick!
4376163 4378623 Go get Dr. Meade. Run! Quick!
4378874 4380208 The baby.
4380459 4383461 Don't stand there like<br />a scared goat. Run!
4385297 4388049 Hurry, hurry!<br />I'll sell you south, I will.
4388300 4389759 I swear I will!
4391011 4393012 Where's that Prissy?
4395682 4400103 This room's like an oven already<br />and it isn't noon yet.
4402689 4404899 Don't worry, Melly.
4405109 4409070 Mother says it always seems<br />like the doctor will never come.
4409905 4412824 If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
4420082 4421249 Oh, Melly...
4421834 4424335 Know what I heard<br />about Maybelle Merriwether?
4424586 4426629 You remember that<br />funny-looking beau of hers?
4426880 4429966 The one with the uniform<br />like ladies' red flannels?
4430217 4433719 You don't have to keep on<br />talking for my sake.
4433971 4436806 I know how worried you are.
4440394 4444689 For to tote the weary load
4444898 4447567 No matter, 'twill never...
4449194 4450486 Oh, Melly...
4450737 4453489 I'll just go and fetch you<br />some cooler water.
4454533 4457368 You're slow as molasses in January.<br />Where's Dr. Meade?
4457619 4459912 - I never seen him, Miss Scarlett.<br />- What?
4460122 4462290 He ain't at the hospital.
4462541 4465668 A man told me that the doctor's<br />down at the car shed...
4465878 4467503 ...with the wounded soldiers-
4467754 4470006 Well, why didn't you go after him?
4470257 4474802 Miss Scarlett, I's scared<br />to go down there at the car shed.
4475053 4480183 There's folks dying down there.<br />And I's scared of dead folks!
4480851 4482268 Go sit by Miss Melly.
4482769 4486230 And don't you be upsetting her<br />or I'll whip the hide off you.
4489610 4491861 Just a few more days
4492070 4495448 For to tote the weary load
4524478 4527313 Have you seen-?<br />Move aside, lady, please.
4530943 4532735 Dr. Meade?
4574736 4576028 Dr. Meade.
4576822 4578030 Dr. Meade, at last!
4578657 4581701 Thank heaven you're here.<br />I need every pair of hands.
4582244 4585288 Now, come, child, wake up.<br />We got work to do.
4585539 4588541 But Melly's having her baby.<br />You've got to come with me!
4589126 4591836 Are you crazy? I can't<br />leave these men for a baby.
4592045 4594672 They're dying! Hundreds!<br />Get a woman to help.
4594923 4598009 But there isn't anybody.<br />Dr. Meade, she might die.
4598260 4602096 Die? Look at them, bleeding<br />to death in front of my eyes!
4602347 4604599 No chloroform. No bandages.<br />Nothing!
4604850 4606434 Nothing to ease their pain.
4606685 4608686 Run along and don't bother me.
4609354 4612440 Don't worry, child.<br />There's nothing to bringing a baby.
4612774 4615109 - Bring the stretchers in here.<br />Dr. Meade?
4615319 4617194 Yeah, I'm coming.
4636131 4638049 Is the doctor come?
4638300 4639634 No, he can't come.
4639885 4642470 Oh, Miss Scarlett,<br />Miss Melly bad off.
4642721 4645348 He can't come.<br />There's nobody to come.
4646058 4649435 You've got to manage<br />without the doctor. I'll help you.
4649686 4651937 Oh, Lordy, Miss Scarlett!
4652731 4653814 Well, what is it?
4654066 4656192 Lordy, we's got to have a doctor!
4656401 4659528 I don't know nothing<br />about birthing babies!
4660530 4662281 - What do you mean?<br />- I don't know-
4662491 4664116 You told me<br />you knew everything!
4664368 4666118 I don't know why I lied!
4666370 4668871 Ma ain't never let me around<br />when folks was having them.
4670457 4673501 Scarlett! Scarlett!
4674753 4676087 Miss Scarlett!
4676505 4678506 Stop it!
4679174 4682051 Go light a fire on the stove.<br />Boil water in the kettle.
4682260 4685971 Get me a ball of twine,<br />clean towels and the scissors.
4686181 4690393 Don't tell me you can't find them!<br />Go get them and get them quick!
4691603 4695398 Scarlett! Scarlett!
4700946 4703739 - Scarlett!<br />- Coming, Melly.
4704658 4706242 Coming!
4709329 4711706 You better go<br />before the Yankees get here.
4711957 4713708 You know I won't leave you.
4713875 4715459 It's no use. I'm gonna die.
4715711 4717753 Don't be a goose, Melly.<br />Hold on to me.
4718004 4721048 - Hold on to me!<br />- Talk to me, Scarlett.
4721258 4723592 Please, talk to me.
4723844 4727012 Don't try to be brave. Yell!<br />There's nobody to hear.
4727264 4732351 Ma says if you puts a knife<br />under the bed, it cuts the pain.
4737190 4739191 Captain Butler!
4739693 4742820 Captain Butler! Captain Butler!
4742988 4744822 - Who do you want?<br />- Captain Butler.
4745031 4747658 He's upstairs.<br />Belle Watling's giving a party.
4747909 4751036 Yes, sir. Thank you.
4753457 4756000 Captain Butler! Oh, Captain Butler!
4756168 4758169 What's all the rumpus about?
4758378 4761547 I's got a message<br />for Captain Butler, Mrs. Watling.
4761798 4765259 Captain Butler, you come out here<br />in the streets to me!
4766803 4770389 - What is it, Prissy?<br />- Miss Scarlett done sent me for you.
4770640 4774018 Miss Melly, she done<br />had her baby today.
4774227 4776729 A fine baby boy.
4776980 4779607 And Miss Scarlett and me,<br />we brung it.
4779858 4781317 Are you telling me Scarlett-?
4781568 4783736 It was mostly me, Captain Butler.
4783987 4786572 Only Miss Scarlett,<br />she helped me a little.
4786823 4790075 But I don't expect no doctor<br />could have done no better.
4790327 4795080 Only, Miss Melly, she feel<br />kind of poorly now it's all over.
4795665 4796957 Yes, I can believe that.

4808887 4811388 I'm sorry, but the army<br />took my horse and carriage.
4811556 4813766 You better come upstairs.<br />I'll see what I can do.
4813975 4815226 Oh, no, Captain Butler.
4815894 4821023 Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk<br />if I was to go into Mrs. Watling's.
4821525 4825528 Any of you beauties know where<br />I can steal a horse for a good cause?
4834371 4837206 Is that you, Rhett?<br />We's here, Miss Scarlett!
4837374 4838582 I knew you'd come.
4838834 4841627 Nice weather we're having.<br />Prissy tells me you're-
4841878 4844588 If you make any jokes now,<br />I'll kill you!
4844840 4847174 - Don't tell me you're frightened?<br />- I'm scared to death!
4847384 4849051 If you had sense,<br />you'd be scared too.
4850428 4852263 - Oh, the Yankees!<br />- No, not yet.
4852472 4855599 That's what's left of our army<br />blowing up the ammunition.
4855851 4857893 We gotta get out of here!
4858144 4860187 At your service.<br />Where are you going?
4860438 4864108 - Home, to Tara.<br />- They've been fighting around Tara.
4864317 4868946 You're going to parade through there<br />with a sick woman, a baby and a darkie?
4869155 4870489 Do you intend leaving them?
4870740 4873075 They're going with me,<br />and you can't stop me!
4873326 4876871 It's dangerous jouncing<br />Mrs. Wilkes over open country.
4877122 4879123 I want my mother!
4879708 4881625 I want to go home to Tara!
4881918 4885212 Tara's probably been burned.<br />The woods are full of stragglers.
4885463 4887381 The least they'll do<br />is take the horse.
4887632 4890217 It's not much,<br />but I had trouble stealing it.
4890468 4893721 I'm going home if I have to walk<br />every step of the way!
4893972 4897266 I'll kill you if you try<br />to stop me! I will, I will!
4897434 4899977 I will, I will!
4904608 4908319 All right, darling, all right.<br />Now you shall go home.
4909863 4913949 I guess anybody who did what you've<br />done today can take care of Sherman.
4916286 4917912 Stop crying.
4919956 4923751 Now blow your nose<br />like a good little girl. There.
4935305 4937681 What're you doing?<br />- I'm packing!
4937891 4940851 Well, stop it<br />and come and get the baby!
4943146 4944271 Melly?
4944814 4946357 - Melly?<br />Mrs. Wilkes?
4947108 4949360 - We're taking you to Tara.<br />- Tara?
4949569 4951153 It's the only way, Melly.
4951363 4954281 They'll burn the house<br />over our heads if we stay.
4954491 4955783 It's all right, Melly.
4956034 4957993 My baby.
4958244 4960371 My poor baby.
4964501 4968587 - Can you put your arms around my neck?<br />- I think so.
4971466 4972967 Never mind.
4973385 4975094 Ashley, Charles!
4975303 4976553 What's she want?
4976805 4979348 Ashley's picture and Charles' sword.
4979599 4981100 Get them.
4997200 4998242 What's that?
4998493 5001370 Our gallant lads set fire<br />to the warehouses.
5001621 5004164 Enough ammunition in boxcars<br />to blow us to Tara.
5004416 5007001 - We have to get across the tracks.<br />- Not that way!
5007252 5011130 We have to. McDonough road's the<br />only one the Yankees haven't cut yet.
5020598 5023142 Wait, I forgot to lock the front door!
5023393 5027187 - What are you laughing at?<br />- At you, locking the Yankees out.
5043538 5045330 Oh, dear!<br />I wish they'd hurry.
5045498 5048042 I wouldn't be in such a hurry<br />to see them go.
5048293 5051587 With them goes the last<br />semblance of law and order.
5053089 5055132 Scavengers aren't wasting any time.
5059804 5061513 Better get out of here fast.
5061765 5063891 There's a horse! Get it!
5065560 5067227 Give us that horse!
5074152 5075736 Down the alley! Cut him off!
5079365 5080616 Pull that horse!
5084621 5086205 I'll get him!
5089417 5090834 Give me that horse!
5101096 5103013 Oh, Miss Scarlett!
5107727 5109394 Haven't left much to take.
5109646 5113148 We'll make a dash for it before<br />the fire reaches that ammunition.
5134337 5135420 Come on!
5140009 5141301 Throw me your shawl.
5144264 5147015 You'll like it better<br />if you don't see anything.
5148852 5150310 Come on!
5207243 5210495 Take a good look, my dear.<br />It's a historic moment.
5210705 5215083 Tell your grandchildren how you watched<br />the Old South disappear one night.
5231935 5236063 They were gonna lick the Yankees<br />in a month. The poor gallant fools.
5236314 5237439 They make me sick.
5237690 5240943 Getting us all into this<br />by swaggering and boasting.
5241152 5244905 That's the way I felt once about<br />their "swaggering and boasting. "
5245406 5247616 I'm so glad you aren't with the army.
5247867 5251787 You can be proud. Proud that<br />you've been smarter than all of them.
5254540 5256583 I'm not so proud.
5275144 5276186 Why did you stop?
5276396 5279356 This is the turn to Tara.<br />Let the horse breathe a bit.
5279524 5280565 Mrs. Wilkes.
5280775 5284111 Miss Melly done fainted<br />way back, Captain Butler.
5284320 5288699 She's better off. She couldn't<br />stand the pain if she were conscious.
5289409 5292327 Scarlett, are you still determined<br />to do this crazy thing?
5292495 5295163 Oh, yes, yes.<br />I know we can get through, Rhett.
5295373 5298417 Not we, my dear, you.<br />I'm leaving you here.
5299210 5301837 You're what?<br />Rhett, where are you going?
5302088 5305173 - I'm going to join the army.<br />- You're joking.
5305425 5308802 - I could kill you for scaring me so.<br />- I'm very serious, Scarlett.
5309012 5311555 I'm going to join up<br />with our brave lads in gray.
5311806 5313515 But they're running away.
5313766 5317728 They'll turn and make a last stand.<br />When they do, I'll be with them.
5317979 5321648 - I'm a little late, but better late-<br />- You must be joking!
5322442 5323942 Selfish to the end, aren't you?
5324193 5327696 Thinking of your own hide,<br />never a thought for the Cause.
5327905 5329406 How could you do this to me?
5329657 5332701 And why should you go now that<br />it's all over, and I need you?
5332869 5334619 - Why? Why?<br />- Why?
5334871 5339041 I've always had a weakness<br />for lost causes, once they're really lost.
5339292 5340459 Or maybe...
5341711 5344171 Maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
5344797 5345881 Who knows?
5346090 5349009 You should die of shame<br />to leave me alone and helpless!
5349260 5351053 You? Helpless?
5351763 5354598 Heaven help the Yankees<br />if they capture you.
5355058 5356892 Now climb down here.
5357101 5358977 - I want to say goodbye.<br />- No!
5360104 5361897 Climb down!
5364817 5366360 Rhett, please don't go!
5366569 5369738 You can't leave me, please.<br />I'll never forgive you!
5369989 5373825 I'm not asking you to forgive me.<br />I'll never forgive myself.
5374077 5378163 If a bullet gets me, I'll laugh<br />at myself for being an idiot.
5378623 5382334 There's one thing I do know,<br />and that is I love you, Scarlett.
5382543 5386713 In spite of you and me and the world<br />going to pieces, I love you.
5386923 5389549 Because we're alike.<br />Bad lots, both of us.
5389801 5394930 Selfish and shrewd, but able to look<br />things in the eye and call them by name.
5395306 5397265 Don't hold me like that!
5397475 5398600 Scarlett...
5398810 5400268 Look at me.
5400520 5402896 I love you more than<br />I've ever loved any woman.
5403147 5406024 And I've waited longer<br />for you than any woman.
5406359 5408193 Let me alone!
5408778 5412614 A soldier of the South loves you.<br />Wants your arms around him.
5412865 5415575 Wants to carry the memory<br />of your kisses into battle.
5415785 5417411 Never mind about loving me.
5417662 5421540 You're a woman sending a soldier<br />to his death with a beautiful memory.
5421749 5424292 Scarlett, kiss me.
5424544 5426962 Kiss me once.
5431300 5433844 You low-down, cowardly,<br />nasty thing, you!
5434095 5438223 They were right. Everybody was right.<br />You aren't a gentleman.
5440601 5443437 A minor point at such a moment.
5444647 5448316 Here. If anyone lays a hand<br />on that nag, shoot him.
5448526 5450527 But don't make a mistake<br />and shoot the nag.
5450778 5452988 Go on! I want you to go.
5453197 5456158 I hope a cannonball blows you<br />into a million pieces-!
5456367 5459619 Never mind the rest.<br />I follow your general idea.
5459871 5464583 And when I'm dead on the altar of my<br />country, I hope your conscience irks you.
5464792 5467210 Goodbye, Scarlett.
5492320 5495989 Come on, you. We're going home.
5570648 5573567 Oh, my poor baby.
5574569 5578113 Don't worry. Mother will take care<br />of him when we get home.
5578364 5581241 Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.
5581450 5584786 - We's got to have something to eat.<br />- Hush up!
5584996 5588456 We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.<br />We'll stop there.
5588708 5590250 Go on!
5654565 5656358 Oh, Ashley.
5657068 5660320 Ashley, I'm glad<br />you're not here to see this.
5661030 5665325 The Yankees. The dirty Yankees!
5679674 5682217 Prissy! Come tie up this cow.
5682635 5684886 We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
5685137 5688348 We'll be home soon,<br />and I's scared of cows.
5688683 5691851 Tie her onto the back of the wagon<br />with your petticoat.
5692103 5696731 We need milk for the baby, and we<br />don't know what we'll find at home.
5705825 5707117 Melly, we're home!
5707284 5710704 We're at Tara.<br />Hurry! Move, you brute!
5711831 5714290 Miss Scarlett, it's dead!
5714542 5716626 I can't see the house. Is it there?
5716794 5718712 I can't see the house.<br />Have they burned it?
5722675 5726761 It's all right! It's all right!<br />They haven't burned it.
5727012 5728638 It's still there!
5732017 5735311 Mother! Mother, I'm home!
5737273 5739899 Mother! Mother, I'm home!
5744739 5747907 Mother, let me in. It's me. Scarlett!
5754039 5755832 Oh, Pa!
5756250 5757917 I'm home.
5759044 5760837 I'm home.
5763382 5764799 Katie?
5765468 5767761 Katie Scarlett!
5767970 5770638 Oh, darlin'!
5780900 5782317 Mammy!
5783194 5785069 Mammy, I'm home.
5785321 5787322 Honey child...
5788866 5790658 Mammy, I'm so...
5791994 5793119 Where's Mother?
5794163 5795663 Why...
5795873 5799709 ...Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,<br />they was sick with the typhoid.
5800127 5803087 They had it bad,<br />but they's doing all right now.
5803339 5806633 - Just weak, like little kittens.<br />- But where's Mother?
5808469 5809636 Well...
5810262 5814057 Miss Ellen. She went down<br />to nurse that Emmie Slattery...
5814308 5818186 ...that white trash,<br />and she took down with it too.
5820231 5821731 Then last night, she-
5821941 5823191 Mother?
5826278 5827779 Mother?
5831951 5833201 Mother?
5838040 5839290 Mother?
5895389 5896639 Miss Scarlett, honey.
5896891 5899934 If there's anything I can do,<br />Miss Scarlett...
5900603 5904480 - What did you do with Melly?<br />- Don't worry your pretty head.
5904690 5907483 I done slapped her in bed,<br />along with the baby.
5907735 5910153 You better put that cow into the barn.
5910404 5912322 There ain't no barn no more.
5912573 5916618 - Yankees burned it for firewood.<br />This was their headquarters.
5916869 5918369 They camped all around.
5918579 5919996 Yankees in Tara?
5920247 5922916 Yes'm, and they stole<br />most everything they didn't burn.
5923167 5927921 All the clothes and all the rugs,<br />and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
5929423 5931299 I'm starving.<br />Get me something to eat.
5931508 5934552 There ain't nothing<br />to eat, honey. They took it all.
5935054 5936512 All the chickens? Everything?
5936764 5938348 They took them first.
5938599 5941309 What they didn't eat,<br />they carried off.
5941560 5944354 Don't tell me any more about<br />what "they" did!
5960162 5961663 What's this, Pa?
5962164 5965625 - Whiskey?<br />- Yes, daughter.
5969254 5971089 Katie Scarlett, that's enough.
5971340 5974425 Your not knowing spirits,<br />you'll make yourself tipsy.
5974635 5976719 I hope it makes me drunk.
5976929 5978972 I'd like to be drunk.
5981684 5983017 Oh, Pa...
5986146 5987480 What are those papers?
5988941 5990650 Bonds.
5991986 5995655 They're all we've saved,<br />all we have left.
5995864 5997156 Bonds.
5997408 6000034 But what kind of bonds, Pa?
6000285 6002578 Why, Confederate bonds, of course.
6002830 6004747 Confederate bonds.
6004999 6007166 What good are they to anybody?
6007418 6010086 I'll not have you talking like that.
6010337 6013423 Oh, Pa, what are we going to do<br />with no money...
6013674 6015258 ...and nothing to eat?
6015884 6017969 We must ask your mother.
6018470 6023182 That's it.<br />We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
6024101 6025685 - Ask Mother?<br />- Yes.
6026603 6029647 Mrs. O'Hara will know<br />what's to be done.
6030357 6034318 Now don't be bothering me.<br />Go out for a ride.
6034486 6035570 I'm busy.
6053839 6055757 Oh, Pa...
6056300 6058426 Don't worry about anything.
6059094 6061345 Katie Scarlett's home.
6063307 6065308 You needn't worry.
6080324 6085328 What'll we do with nothing<br />to feed those sick folks and that child?
6086872 6088664 I don't know, Mammy.
6089166 6090249 I don't know.
6090417 6093252 We ain't got nothing<br />but radishes in the garden.
6093545 6096422 Miss Scarlett,<br />Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...
6096673 6099717 ...they's fussing to be sponged off.
6099927 6103721 - Where are the other servants?<br />- Only just me and Pork left.
6103972 6106182 The others went to war<br />or runned away.
6106391 6109769 I can't take care of<br />that baby and sick folkses too!
6110521 6112438 I's only got two hands.
6112689 6117819 Who's gonna milk that cow,<br />Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.
6199902 6202361 As God is my witness...
6202613 6206115 As God is my witness,<br />they're not going to lick me.
6206325 6209327 I'm going to live through this,<br />and when it's all over...
6209536 6214081 ...I'll never be hungry again.<br />No, nor any of my folk.
6214833 6218169 If I have to lie, steal,<br />cheat, or kill...
6218420 6223549 ...as God is my witness,<br />I'll never be hungry again!
6655440 6658484 My back's near broken.
6660153 6662404 Look at my hands!
6662572 6665949 Mother said you could always<br />tell a lady by her hands.
6666201 6670579 I guess things like hands and ladies<br />don't matter so much anymore.
6671039 6674750 Rest, Sue. You're not well yet.<br />I can pick cotton for both of us.
6675043 6678545 Scarlett's hateful!<br />Making us work in the fields-
6678755 6680756 Too bad about that.
6681091 6684009 Get back to work. I can't do<br />everything at Tara myself.
6684260 6686595 What do I care about Tara?<br />I hate Tara!
6689933 6692685 Don't you ever dare say<br />you hate Tara again!
6693561 6696021 It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.
6703363 6705781 There's something<br />I must speak to you about.
6705949 6706990 What is it?
6707242 6710619 I don't like the way<br />you're treating Prissy and Mammy.
6710912 6715624 You must be firm with inferiors,<br />but gentle with them. Especially darkies.
6715917 6719628 I know. But I'm not asking them to do<br />what I don't do myself.
6719879 6724800 Nevertheless, I don't like it.<br />I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
6739482 6742735 - What are you doing out of bed?<br />- I must talk to you.
6742986 6745821 You're all working so hard.<br />I can't just lie in bed.
6746114 6748574 Go upstairs.<br />You're as weak as a newborn colt.
6748783 6751076 - Please, let me.<br />- Stop being noble.
6751327 6755164 I don't need you making yourself<br />sick so you'll never be any use.
6755415 6758333 Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
6813598 6816558 Who's there?<br />Halt or I'll shoot!
6822649 6824691 You all alone, little lady?
6827320 6829696 You ain't very friendly, are you?
6832492 6835035 You got anything else<br />besides these earbobs?
6835328 6837329 You Yankees have been here before.
6838122 6840541 Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
6841876 6844503 What do you got hidden in your hand?
6879539 6882249 Scarlett, you killed him.
6882959 6884877 I'm glad you killed him.
6886087 6889756 Scarlett, what happened?<br />What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
6893803 6894887 Don't be scared!
6895138 6899600 Your sister was cleaning a revolver<br />and it went off and scared her.
6899809 6902728 Thank goodness!<br />We got enough to frighten us.
6902979 6906231 Tell Katie Scarlett<br />she must be more careful.
6908818 6910819 What a cool liar you are, Melly.
6911696 6913822 We gotta get him out of here<br />and bury him.
6914115 6915699 If the Yankees find him here-
6915909 6918994 I didn't see anyone else.<br />I think he must be a deserter.
6919245 6920829 Even so, we've gotta hide him.
6921080 6925208 They might hear about it,<br />and then they'd come and get you.
6927712 6931089 I could bury him in the arbor<br />where the ground is soft...
6931341 6933342 ...but how will I get him<br />out of here?
6933635 6937512 - We'll both take a leg and drag him.<br />- You couldn't drag a cat.
6941517 6942684 Scarlett...
6943853 6946939 Would it be dishonest<br />if we went through his haversack?
6947190 6949524 I'm ashamed I didn't think<br />of that myself.
6949776 6952527 You take the haversack.<br />I'll search his pockets.
6964791 6968126 You look. I'm feeling a little weak.
6969504 6971505 I think it's full of money.
6971756 6975884 Melly, look. Just look!<br />Ten, 20, 30-
6976135 6978387 Don't stop to count it now.<br />We haven't got time!
6978680 6980722 Do you realize this means we can eat?
6980974 6983183 Look in his other pockets.
6984852 6986353 Hurry, hurry!
6986562 6988563 We've got to get him out of here.
7002286 7004913 If he bleeds across the yard,<br />we can't hide it.
7005164 7008041 Give me your nightgown.<br />I'll wad it round his head.
7008292 7013422 Don't be silly, I won't look at you.<br />If I had on pantalets, I'd use them.
7026853 7029438 Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
7030106 7032441 Now go back to bed.<br />You'll be dead if you don't.
7032692 7034901 I'll clean up my mess<br />when I've buried him.
7035403 7037696 No, I'll clean it up.
7040950 7043243 Well, I guess I've done murder.
7044954 7049458 I won't think about that now.<br />I'll think about that tomorrow.
7061137 7062721 Katie Scarlett!
7062930 7064723 It's over! It's over!
7065808 7069102 It's all over, the war.<br />Lee surrendered!
7069353 7071772 - It's not possible.<br />- Why did we ever fight?
7071981 7073607 Ashley will be coming home.
7074150 7076234 Yes, Ashley will be coming home.
7076444 7080781 We'll plant more cotton.<br />Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.
7103721 7105889 The flag that makes you free
7106057 7109142 So we sing the chorus<br />From Atlanta to the sea
7109393 7112979 While we were marching through Georgia
7113189 7115190 Get out of the road, rebel!
7115399 7117651 Have you room for a dying man?
7117902 7121321 Not for any Southern scum,<br />alive or dead. Get out of the way!
7121864 7124658 I reckon he'd rather try<br />and walk it, at that.
7124909 7126993 Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
7127203 7129371 Acts like they won the war.
7129831 7132332 You come on, give me<br />them pants, Mr. Kennedy.
7132542 7133792 Come on!
7135920 7139381 Scrub yourself with that lye soap,<br />'fore I scrub you myself.
7139632 7142717 I'm gonna put these britches<br />in the boiling pot.
7145513 7147639 The whole army's<br />got the same troubles...
7147890 7150517 ...crawling clothes and dysentery.
7150726 7152644 It's humiliating how<br />you're treating him.
7152937 7156690 You'd be a sight more humiliated<br />if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you.
7158359 7160026 Oh, come on, Beau!
7160236 7164447 We must leave this gentleman alone<br />because he's tired and he's hungry.
7164699 7167534 I don't mind, ma'am.<br />Good to see a youngster again.
7167743 7168994 Nice little fella.
7169203 7172497 Another two years, and we could've<br />had him in Cobb's Legion.
7173666 7176501 - Were you in Cobb's Legion?<br />Yes, ma'am.
7176752 7180213 Why, then, you must know<br />my husband, Major Wilkes?
7180381 7184009 Oh, yes, ma'am. He was captured<br />at Spotsylvania, I think.
7184260 7188221 Captured? Oh, thank heaven!<br />Then he isn't-
7188472 7191683 - My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.<br />Melanie?
7192602 7195437 Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.<br />Come along, Beau.
7195605 7198023 I'll watch out for him.<br />We're good friends.
7198274 7199858 Thank you.
7203905 7207115 I slave day and night<br />just so we can have enough food...
7207366 7209618 ...and you give it away<br />to scarecrows.
7209911 7213622 - I'd sooner have a plague of locusts.<br />- Don't scold me, Scarlett.
7213789 7216499 I've just heard that Ashley<br />was taken prisoner.
7216709 7218210 - Ashley a prisoner?<br />- Yes.
7218461 7222797 And maybe if he's alive and well,<br />he's on some Northern road right now.
7223049 7226134 Maybe a Northern woman<br />is giving him some of her dinner...
7226302 7229888 ...and helping my beloved<br />to come back home to me.
7231307 7234100 - I hope so, Melly.<br />Miss Scarlett?
7237438 7241816 I want to take up something<br />with your Pa, but he doesn't seem to-
7242068 7244611 Perhaps I can help you.<br />I'm head of the house now.
7244779 7246821 Well, I- I...
7247031 7249908 Miss Scarlett, I was aiming<br />to ask for Suellen.
7250826 7255080 Are you telling me you haven't asked<br />for her after all these years?
7256165 7258959 The truth is, I'm so much<br />older than she is...
7259168 7261169 ...and now I haven't<br />a cent to my name.
7261462 7263046 Who has, nowadays?
7263297 7266007 Miss Scarlett, if true love<br />carries any weight with you...
7266259 7269010 ...you can be sure your sister<br />will be rich in that.
7269262 7272430 I'd go and get myself a little business,<br />if we're engaged.
7272682 7274975 - As soon as I'm on my feet again-<br />- All right, Frank.
7275184 7278687 I'm sure I can speak for Pa.<br />You go ask her now.
7279146 7282190 Thank you.<br />Thank you, Miss Scarlett.
7284610 7287445 Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />Excuse me.
7289323 7292200 What seems to be<br />the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
7292451 7296204 More trouble than he guesses.<br />He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.
7296372 7297872 Oh, I'm so glad.
7298207 7302544 It's a pity he can't marry her now.<br />It'd be one less mouth to feed.
7306215 7308133 Oh, another one!
7308384 7310677 - Hope this one isn't hungry.<br />- He'll be hungry.
7310886 7313388 I'll tell Prissy to get<br />an extra plate-
7325151 7326359 Ashley!
7328738 7330071 Ashley!
7342877 7343918 Miss Scarlett!
7344211 7345337 Don't spoil it.
7345588 7348423 Turn me loose, you fool.<br />Turn me loose! It's Ashley!
7348674 7350717 He's her husband, ain't he?
7363105 7364939 - Miss Scarlett?<br />- High time you got back.
7365191 7368193 - Did you get the horse shod?<br />- Yes'm, he's shod.
7368402 7370779 Fine thing, horses<br />get shoes and humans can't.
7371030 7372655 Here, stir this soap.
7372907 7374074 Miss Scarlett, ma'am?
7374283 7377535 I gotta know how much money<br />have you got left. In gold.
7377745 7379746 Ten dollars. Why?
7380539 7381748 That won't be enough.
7381957 7383708 What are you talking about?
7383959 7388171 Well, I see'd that old no-count<br />white-trash Wilkerson...
7388422 7390965 ...that used to be<br />Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
7391217 7394719 He's a regular Yankee now,<br />and he was making a brag...
7394929 7399933 ...that his Carpetbagger friends run<br />the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
7400184 7404729 - How much more we got to pay?<br />- I hear the taxman say $300.
7404939 7406398 Three hundred-!
7407441 7411820 It might just as well be 3 million.<br />But we gotta raise it, that's all.
7412071 7414739 Yes'm. How?
7416700 7420161 - I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.<br />- He ain't got no $300.
7420329 7423081 Well, I can ask him<br />if I want to, can't I?
7425251 7427168 Asking ain't getting.
7436178 7437720 Ashley...
7438722 7441850 They say Abe Lincoln<br />got his start splitting rails.
7442101 7445019 Just think what heights I may<br />climb to, once I get the knack.
7445229 7449524 Ashley, the Yankees<br />want $300 more in taxes.
7450359 7452277 What shall we do?
7452528 7454988 Ashley, what's to become of us?
7455197 7458741 What becomes of people<br />when their civilization breaks up?
7458951 7461661 Those with brains and courage<br />come through all right.
7461871 7463538 Those that haven't are winnowed out.
7463789 7465039 For heaven's sake...
7465291 7468751 ...don't talk nonsense<br />when it's us being winnowed out!
7469003 7473548 You're right, Scarlett. Here I am<br />talking tommyrot about civilization...
7473799 7475884 ...while your Tara is in danger.
7476135 7478970 You've come to me for help,<br />and I've none to give.
7479805 7483141 Oh, Scarlett, I'm a coward.
7483517 7485643 You, Ashley? A coward?
7486228 7487770 What are you afraid of?
7488647 7492525 Mostly of life becoming<br />too real for me, I suppose.
7492735 7495278 Not that I mind splitting rails.
7495654 7500408 But I do mind very much losing<br />the beauty of that life I loved.
7501994 7507081 If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent<br />my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
7507374 7508583 But the war did come.
7509210 7511753 I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
7512004 7515089 I saw men crumple up in agony<br />when I shot them.
7515925 7520512 And now I find myself in a world<br />which for me is worse than death.
7520763 7522931 A world in which there's<br />no place for me.
7525100 7528811 I can't make you understand.<br />You don't know the meaning of fear.
7529021 7531731 You never mind facing realities.
7532441 7534943 You never want to escape<br />from them as I do.
7537613 7539239 Escape?
7540324 7544452 Ashley, you're wrong.<br />I do want to escape too.
7544745 7549457 I'm so very tired of it all.<br />I've struggled for food and for money.
7549625 7553211 I've weeded, hoed and picked cotton<br />till I can't stand it.
7553462 7555755 I tell you, the South is dead.<br />It's dead!
7555965 7559884 The Yankees and Carpetbaggers<br />have it and left nothing for us.
7562137 7563596 Oh, Ashley...
7564265 7567100 Let's run away.<br />We'd go to Mexico.
7567351 7570311 They want officers in the Mexican army.<br />We'd be happy.
7570479 7572605 I'd work for you.<br />I'd do anything for you!
7572815 7576276 You don't love Melanie. You said<br />you loved me at Twelve Oaks.
7576485 7578653 And anyway, Melanie can't-
7579280 7582657 Dr. Meade said she can't have<br />more children. I could give you-
7582908 7584492 Can't we ever forget Twelve Oaks?
7584785 7586995 You think I could ever forget?<br />Have you?
7587288 7590331 Can you honestly say<br />you don't love me?
7591000 7593418 - No, I don't love you.<br />- It's a lie!
7593627 7596588 Even so, do you think<br />I'd leave Melanie and the baby?
7596797 7599507 You couldn't leave<br />your father and the girls.
7599800 7602093 I'm sick of them.<br />I'm tired of them!
7602303 7605972 Yes, you're sick and tired.<br />That's why you're talking this way.
7607182 7609267 You've carried the load<br />for all of us.
7609476 7612520 From now on, I'll be more help<br />to you. I promise.
7612688 7614689 There's only one way you can help me.
7614982 7619110 Take me away.<br />There's nothing to keep us here.
7619987 7621404 Nothing?
7622906 7625158 Nothing except honor.
7637713 7641466 Please, Scarlett.<br />Please, dear. You mustn't cry.
7641717 7646429 You mustn't. Please,<br />my brave dear, you mustn't.
7658525 7661235 You do love me! You do love me!
7661445 7663738 - No, don't, don't.<br />- You love me.
7664031 7666199 We won't do this.<br />I tell you, we won't do it!
7666408 7669202 It won't happen again.<br />I'll take Melanie and go.
7669453 7672080 - Say it. You love me.<br />- All right, I'll say it.
7672331 7676417 I love your courage and stubbornness<br />so much that I could forget...
7676585 7681255 ...the best wife a man ever had.<br />But I'm not going to forget her!
7690432 7692934 Then there's nothing left for me.
7693936 7696062 Nothing to fight for.
7696772 7698981 Nothing to live for.
7701360 7703569 Yes, there is something.
7704238 7706864 Something you love better than me...
7707074 7708991 ...though you may not know it.
7714998 7716499 Tara.
7719878 7721212 Yes.
7723132 7725258 I still have this.
7729888 7731514 You needn't go.
7732099 7736310 I won't have you all starve, simply<br />because I threw myself at your head.
7736979 7739230 It won't happen again.
7766842 7768009 It's Emmie Slattery.
7768177 7769469 - Yes'm, it's me.<br />Stop!
7770679 7773639 You haven't forgotten<br />your old overseer, have you?
7774349 7776350 Emmie's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
7776602 7779187 Get off those steps, you wench!<br />Get off this land!
7779646 7781355 You can't speak that way to my wife.
7781607 7783649 Wife? High time<br />you made her your wife.
7783859 7786277 Who baptized your brats<br />after you killed my mother?
7786779 7788488 We came out here to pay a call.
7788697 7791699 A friendly call, and talk business<br />with old friends.
7791950 7794368 Friends? When were we ever friends?
7794661 7797705 Still high and mighty, ain't you?<br />Well, I know all about you.
7797956 7799332 Your father's turned idiot.
7799583 7803461 You can't pay your taxes, and I come<br />to offer to buy the place from you.
7803670 7807089 To make you a right good offer.<br />Emmie wants to live here.
7807341 7809300 Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!
7809551 7814138 You'll see who's running<br />things when you're sold out for taxes.
7814389 7816682 I'll buy this place<br />and I'll live in it!
7817100 7819519 But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
7819728 7822230 That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
7823357 7825358 You'll be sorry for that.
7833909 7835243 We'll be back!
7835494 7838079 I'll show you who<br />the owner of Tara is!
7843377 7844919 Pa, come back!
7847923 7849757 Pa, come back!
7851885 7853386 Yankee coward!
7861270 7862353 Pa!
7882708 7885877 Lordy, Miss Scarlett,<br />that's Mr. Gerald's watch!
7886128 7889088 You take it. It's for you.<br />Pa'd want you to have it.
7889298 7892550 You ain't got no business<br />parting from this watch now.
7892801 7896095 You needs all your valuables<br />to sell for that tax money.
7896305 7898973 Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
7899975 7901976 And don't cry.
7902185 7904812 I can stand everybody's<br />tears but yours.
7908734 7911068 Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
7916325 7920703 You've been brave so long.<br />You just gotta go on being brave.
7920913 7924832 - Think about your Pa like he used to be.<br />- I can't think about Pa.
7925083 7927251 I can't think of anything<br />but that $300.
7927502 7931923 Ain't no good thinking about that.<br />Ain't nobody got that much money.
7932215 7936302 Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags<br />got that much money now.
7937804 7938846 Rhett.
7939097 7941724 Who that? A Yankee?
7945979 7949607 Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale...
7949816 7952151 ...and I haven't any clothes.
7961620 7964246 Go and get Ma's old box<br />of dress patterns.
7964498 7967208 - What you up to?<br />- You'll make me a new dress.
7967459 7969877 Not with Miss Ellen's portières!
7970128 7972838 Great balls of fire!<br />They're my portières now.
7973048 7976759 I'm going to Atlanta for $300,<br />and I've got to look like a queen.
7976969 7978761 - Who's going with you?<br />- I'll go alone.
7978971 7983057 That's what you think!<br />I's going with you and that new dress.
7983308 7986060 - Mammy, darling.<br />- No use to try to sweet talk me.
7986311 7988771 I knows you since I put<br />diapers on you.
7989022 7992066 I said I's going with you,<br />and going I is!
7992275 7995486 Kings in trade, eh?<br />Too good for me, major.
7996196 7998489 It's a pity the war<br />wasn't a poker game.
7998740 8001575 You'd done better than Grant,<br />with far less effort.
8001743 8002785 What is it?
8003036 8006580 There's a lady to see Captain Butler.<br />Says she's his sister.
8006873 8008416 Another sister?
8008667 8010918 This is a jail not a harem, captain.
8011211 8014588 No, she ain't one of those.<br />She's got her mammy with her.
8015590 8017425 She has?
8018051 8021595 I'd like to see this one, major.<br />Without her mammy.
8022806 8026600 Let's see, my losses for<br />the afternoon come to what?
8028020 8029520 Three hundred and forty?
8029730 8032523 My debts do mount up,<br />don't they, major?
8032733 8037528 All right, corporal, show Captain<br />Butler's "sister" to his cell.
8037738 8040781 Thank you, major.<br />Excuse me, gentlemen.
8045037 8049707 It's hard to be strict with a man<br />who loses money so pleasantly.
8050625 8053127 - Rhett!<br />- Scarlett!
8053378 8056422 My dear little sister!
8056798 8061427 It's all right, corporal. My sister<br />has brought me no files or saws.
8066600 8067641 Can I really kiss you?
8067934 8069810 On the forehead, like a good brother.
8070062 8073314 No, thanks. I'll wait and hope<br />for better things.
8073565 8076484 I was so distressed when<br />I heard you were in jail.
8076735 8080654 I couldn't sleep for thinking.<br />It's not true they'll hang you?
8080906 8082490 Would you be sorry?
8082741 8084408 - Oh, Rhett.<br />- Well, don't worry yet.
8084659 8087745 They trumped up a charge,<br />but they really want my money.
8087996 8090664 They think I made off<br />with the Confederate treasury.
8090916 8093459 - Well, did you?<br />- What a leading question.
8093668 8095878 Let's not talk about things<br />like money.
8096129 8099507 How good of you to come and see me.<br />And how pretty you look!
8099800 8102510 How you do run on,<br />teasing a country girl like me.
8102803 8107306 Thank heavens you're not in rags.<br />I'm tired of women in rags. Turn around.
8108141 8110351 You look good enough to eat,<br />and prosperous.
8110602 8114021 I've been doing very well.<br />Everyone's well at Tara, only...
8114272 8117775 ...I got so bored, I thought<br />I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
8118026 8120528 You're heartless,<br />but that's part of your charm.
8120695 8122863 You've got more charm<br />than the law allows.
8123115 8125449 I didn't come to talk<br />silliness about me.
8125700 8128536 I was so miserable at the thought<br />of you in trouble.
8128787 8131705 I was mad at you when<br />you left me on the road to Tara.
8131915 8134875 - And I still haven't forgiven you.<br />- Don't say that.
8135127 8139046 Well, I must admit I might not be<br />alive now, only for you.
8139297 8143050 When I think of myself<br />with anything I could possibly hope for...
8143301 8147138 ...not a care in the world,<br />and you here in this horrid jail.
8147347 8151058 And not even a human jail,<br />Rhett, a horse jail!
8151726 8154145 Listen to me trying to make jokes...
8154354 8156063 ...when I really want to cry.
8156565 8158315 In a minute I shall cry.
8161736 8163028 Scarlett...
8163363 8164905 Can it be possible that-?
8165157 8166949 Can what be possible, Rhett?
8167200 8170703 That you've grown a woman's heart?<br />A real woman's heart.
8170954 8174039 I have, Rhett. I know I have.
8175876 8179170 It's worth being in jail<br />just to hear you say that.
8181006 8182756 It's well worth it.
8187220 8189597 You can drop the moonlight<br />and magnolia.
8189890 8193767 Things have been going well at Tara?<br />What've you done with your hands?
8194102 8199190 - I went riding without my gloves-<br />- You've been working like a field hand!
8199399 8201567 Why did you lie,<br />and what are you up to?
8201776 8204904 - I almost believed you cared.<br />- But I do care!
8205113 8208240 Let's get down to the truth.<br />You want something enough...
8208450 8210576 ...to put on quite a<br />show in your velvets.
8210785 8213204 What is it? Money?
8213413 8215998 I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
8216249 8218709 I lied when I said<br />everything was all right.
8218960 8223464 Things are as bad as they possibly<br />could be. And you've got millions.
8224466 8226050 What collateral do you have?
8226259 8227760 - My earbobs.<br />- Not interested.
8227969 8230262 - Mortgage on Tara.<br />- What would I do with a farm?
8230472 8234892 - I'd pay you out of next year's cotton.<br />- Not good enough.
8237520 8239813 You once said you loved me.
8240023 8241482 If you still love me...
8242275 8244652 You haven't forgotten,<br />I'm not a marrying man.
8245528 8248280 No, I haven't forgotten.
8253536 8255663 You're not worth $300.
8255956 8258791 You'll never mean anything<br />but misery to any man.
8259251 8262086 I don't care what you say,<br />only give me the money.
8262337 8266006 I won't let Tara go! I can't while<br />there's a breath left in my body.
8266174 8269843 Oh, Rhett, won't you please<br />give me the money?
8270136 8272179 I couldn't if I wanted to.
8272430 8274348 My funds are in Liverpool,<br />not Atlanta.
8274599 8278352 If I drew a draft, they'd be on me<br />like a duck on a June bug.
8278603 8282356 So you see, my dear,<br />you've abased yourself to no purpose.
8284859 8289280 Here, here. Stop it! You want<br />the Yankees to see you like this?
8289531 8293617 Take your hands off me, you skunk!<br />You knew what I wanted.
8293868 8297037 You knew you wouldn't lend me<br />the money and you let me go on!
8297205 8299957 I enjoyed hearing<br />what you had to say. Cheer up.
8300166 8302376 Come to my hanging,<br />I'll put you in my will.
8302627 8304378 I'll come to your hanging!
8304629 8308632 I'm just afraid they won't hang you<br />in time to pay the taxes on Tara!
8315181 8316724 Tell him Belle Watling.
8316891 8319893 Where you been? I thought<br />you deserted Captain Butler.
8320186 8322813 I keep myself occupied.<br />Help me out.
8331531 8335409 Who that? I ain't never see'd hair<br />that color before in my life.
8335702 8337202 You know a dyed-haired woman?
8337412 8340581 Wish I knew that one.<br />She'd get my money for me.
8342667 8344543 Whatever they done<br />to you in there...
8344753 8348714 ...they didn't do no more than you<br />deserve for visiting white trash.
8355597 8357848 Fresh and green.<br />Right off the farm.
8358058 8361769 What you doing tonight, Susie?<br />That's a Georgia peach!
8362062 8363687 Nothing like that in Ohio.
8363855 8365272 You know what we'll do?
8365440 8366482 What?
8366649 8369526 We're gonna give every one of you<br />40 acres and a mule.
8369778 8372529 And a mule?<br />- Forty acres and a mule!
8372697 8375115 Gee!<br />- Because we're your friend.
8375367 8379661 And you're gonna become voters<br />and vote like your friends do!
8381581 8384041 What's your hurry?<br />What's come over this town?
8384250 8387961 Yankees have come over it.<br />Same as they've come over all of them.
8390131 8391965 Out of our way, trash!
8392258 8394885 Get out of the way here!<br />Get away! Go on.
8403186 8404686 It can't be Miss Scarlett!
8404938 8406605 Frank Kennedy!<br />And Mammy.
8406815 8408690 It's good to see home folks.
8408942 8411777 I didn't know you were here.<br />I didn't know you were.
8411986 8414279 Didn't Suellen tell you<br />about my store?
8414489 8417408 Did she? I don't remember.<br />Have you a store?
8417826 8421161 - This?<br />- Won't you come in, look around a bit?
8429337 8431839 I don't suppose<br />it looks like much to a lady...
8432090 8434341 ...but I can't help being proud of it.
8434592 8437428 - You're not making money?<br />- Well, I can't complain.
8437637 8439346 In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
8439597 8442015 Folks tell me<br />I'm just a born merchant.
8442308 8445185 Won't be long before<br />Miss Suellen and I can marry.
8445437 8448730 - Are you doing as well as all that?<br />- Yes, I am.
8448982 8450607 I'm no millionaire yet...
8450859 8453277 ...but I've cleared $1000 already.
8453528 8454987 And lumber too.
8456531 8459366 - That's only a sideline.<br />- A sideline, Frank?
8459534 8463454 With all the good Georgia pine<br />around Atlanta, and all this building?
8463663 8466373 Well, all that takes money,<br />Miss Scarlett...
8466624 8468959 ...and I gotta think<br />about buying a home.
8469210 8470544 Why would you want a home?
8470795 8473046 For Suellen to set up housekeeping.
8473506 8474965 Here in Atlanta.
8475175 8477468 You'd want to bring her to Atlanta.
8477760 8480387 There wouldn't be much help<br />in that for Tara.
8481264 8483182 I don't know what you mean.
8484058 8485809 I don't mean a thing.
8486478 8489313 How'd you like to drive me<br />to my Aunt Pitty's?
8489647 8491982 Nothing'd give me more pleasure.
8492192 8493775 You better stay to supper.
8494027 8497196 Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable,<br />and I'd like a long visit.
8497405 8500908 You act on me just like a tonic,<br />Miss Scarlett.
8501242 8503285 And will you tell me all the news...
8503536 8504912 ...of Miss Suellen?
8508082 8511168 What's the matter?<br />Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
8511669 8515172 Oh, no, no. I thought<br />surely she had written you.
8515381 8518592 I guess she was ashamed to write you.<br />She should be ashamed.
8518843 8521094 How awful to have such a mean sister.
8521429 8523180 You must tell me.
8523431 8525390 Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
8525600 8528936 Well, she's going to marry<br />one of the county boys next month.
8530021 8533690 She got tired of waiting,<br />was afraid she'd be an old maid and...
8533900 8536818 Oh, I'm sorry to be<br />the one to tell you.
8537320 8539947 It's cold, and I left my muff at home.
8540240 8543450 Would you mind if I put my hand<br />in your pocket?
8559467 8562302 But, Melanie, you don't realize<br />what she's done!
8562554 8564972 She's gone and married<br />my Mr. Kennedy!
8565223 8567266 He's my beau and she's married him!
8567475 8570727 - She did it to save Tara.<br />- I hate Tara!
8570979 8574565 I hate Scarlett! She's<br />the only thing I hate worse than Tara!
8578820 8580612 It's all my fault.
8581447 8584616 I should've committed robbery<br />to get that tax money for you.
8584867 8587119 I couldn't let you do<br />anything like that.
8587370 8588787 Anyway, it's done now.
8588997 8591164 Yes, it's done now.
8591374 8593500 You won't let me do<br />anything dishonorable...
8593751 8596837 ...yet you'd sell yourself in marriage<br />to a man you didn't love.
8597005 8599840 You won't have to worry<br />about my helplessness anymore.
8601509 8602926 What do you mean?
8603177 8605012 I'm going to New York.
8606264 8607973 I've arranged<br />for a position in a bank.
8608182 8610183 But you can't do that.
8612395 8615814 I counted on you to help me start<br />a lumber business and...
8615982 8617024 I counted on you.
8617275 8620027 I don't know anything<br />about the lumber business.
8620320 8622696 You know as much as you do<br />about banking...
8622989 8625699 ...and I'd give you half the business.
8625950 8628493 That's generous of you, Scarlett.
8628870 8630454 But it isn't that.
8630663 8633540 If I go to Atlanta<br />and take help from you again...
8633791 8636209 ...I'd bury any hope<br />of ever standing alone.
8636461 8637794 Oh, is that all?
8638004 8642716 You could gradually buy the business,<br />and then it would be your own and-
8643384 8644843 No, Scarlett.
8647472 8649848 Oh! Ashley!
8657315 8658899 Ashley!
8666366 8667449 Scarlett?
8668826 8670077 Scarlett, what is it?
8670328 8672704 Ashley's so mean and hateful!
8672955 8674665 What have you done?
8675375 8677918 She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
8678503 8682172 To help me start my lumber business.<br />And he won't help me!
8682757 8684549 How unchivalrous of you.
8684759 8686760 Why, think, Ashley, think!
8687011 8690097 If it hadn't been for Scarlett,<br />I'd have died in Atlanta...
8690264 8692766 ...and maybe we wouldn't have<br />little Beau.
8692975 8695435 When I think of her picking cotton<br />and plowing...
8695687 8698230 ...just to keep food in our mouths,<br />I could just-
8698439 8700524 Oh, my darling.
8704570 8707280 All right, Melanie.<br />I'll go to Atlanta.
8709492 8711410 I can't fight you both.
8726259 8728260 Come on, lift them feet!
8730722 8733515 There's your new mill hands,<br />Mrs. Kennedy.
8733766 8736810 The pick of all the best jails<br />in Georgia.
8737270 8740313 They look thin and weak.<br />Halt!
8742942 8744317 They're the best you can lease.
8744569 8747279 If you'll give Johnnie Gallegher<br />a free hand...
8747530 8749740 ...you'll get what you want<br />out of them.
8749949 8751825 All right, you're the foreman.
8752076 8755412 Just keep the mill running<br />and deliver my lumber when I want it.
8755663 8758498 Johnnie Gallegher's<br />your man, miss. But remember...
8758750 8761293 ...no questions and no interference.
8761669 8764129 That's a bargain.<br />Start in the morning.
8764338 8766298 Come on, get a move on there!
8766507 8771261 But this isn't right, and you know it.<br />Bad enough to be a businesswoman-
8771471 8772679 Why do you complain?
8772972 8775182 You wouldn't own a mill<br />if I didn't take over.
8775349 8777058 But I didn't want the mill.
8777268 8780937 We couldn't buy it if you hadn't<br />pressed our friends for their debts.
8781105 8782272 Isn't that right, Ashley?
8782482 8784566 Are you running<br />a charitable institution?
8784817 8788195 Go back to the store, and go home<br />and take your medicine.
8788488 8790030 Sugar, don't you think-?
8790281 8793950 Great balls of fire! Don't bother me.<br />And don't call me "sugar. "
8794160 8797621 All right. All right.<br />Good night, Ashley.
8798206 8799706 My, my!
8799957 8803126 She can get mad quicker<br />than any woman I ever saw.
8804462 8806296 I don't like to interfere...
8806506 8809841 ...but I wish you'd let me hire<br />darkies and not use convicts.
8810092 8811218 We could do better.
8811511 8814221 Darkies' pay would break us.<br />Convicts are cheap.
8814514 8816181 If we give Gallegher a free hand-
8816390 8819643 A free hand? That means<br />he'll starve and whip them.
8819894 8821895 Didn't you see them?<br />Some are sick.
8822104 8823480 How you do run on.
8823731 8826316 If I let you alone,<br />you'd give them chicken...
8826567 8828610 ...and tuck them in with quilts.
8828861 8832572 I won't make money out of the<br />enforced labor and misery of others.
8832824 8834324 You didn't mind owning slaves.
8834659 8837160 That was different.<br />We didn't treat them that way.
8837411 8839412 I'd have freed them<br />when father died...
8839705 8841832 ...if the war hadn't<br />already freed them.
8842083 8843583 Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
8843751 8846002 Do you forget what it's like<br />without money?
8846254 8849005 Money is the most<br />important thing in the world.
8849215 8851341 I don't intend to be without it again.
8851592 8855887 I'll make enough the only way I know<br />how so the Yankees can't take Tara.
8856138 8858515 We're not the only Southerners<br />who've suffered.
8858766 8862394 Look at all our friends. They're<br />keeping their honor and kindness.
8862645 8866147 And they're starving. I've no use<br />for fools who won't help themselves.
8866399 8868608 I know what they say about me.<br />I don't care.
8868776 8871570 I'll befriend Carpetbaggers<br />and beat them at their own game.
8871779 8873655 And you'll beat them with me.
8876200 8879369 That's it. Pull it<br />a little over to that side.
8879620 8882163 - Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.<br />- Good afternoon.
8882415 8885041 - Business is certainly growing.<br />- It certainly is.
8886752 8888879 You're doing business<br />with the people...
8889130 8892090 ...who robbed us, tortured us<br />and left us to starve.
8892258 8893300 All that's past.
8893593 8897178 I intend to make the best of things,<br />even if they are Yankee things.
8899807 8902976 And do you know that Dr. Meade<br />actually saw her...
8903227 8906563 - ... peddling lumber to Yankees herself?<br />- That isn't all.
8906772 8909482 It's shocking what she's doing<br />to my brother.
8909692 8912611 She's even taken to driving<br />her own buggy.
8920119 8923496 My dear Mrs. Kennedy.<br />My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!
8923706 8925999 I don't see how you have<br />the gall to face me!
8926208 8929920 You could've had my millions<br />if you'd just waited a while.
8930171 8931588 Oh, how fickle is woman!
8931839 8934090 What is it you want?<br />I have things to do.
8934300 8938261 Will you satisfy my curiosity on a point<br />which has always bothered me?
8938471 8939679 Well, what is it?
8940222 8944309 Tell me, do you never shrink<br />from marrying men you don't love?
8944602 8947854 How'd you get out of jail?<br />Why didn't they hang you?
8948356 8951608 Oh, that! There's nothing much<br />that money won't buy.
8951817 8955153 I observe it's even bought you<br />the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
8955446 8959366 So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.<br />I believe you're jealous of him.
8959617 8964329 You still think you're the belle of the<br />county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.
8964538 8967666 - That every man is in love with you.<br />- Let me by.
8968542 8971628 Don't be angry.<br />Tell me, where are you going?
8971837 8974965 - I'm going out to the mill.<br />- Through Shantytown alone?
8975216 8978510 It's dangerous to drive alone<br />through all that riffraff.
8978761 8980178 Don't worry about me.
8980388 8983723 I can shoot straight,<br />if I don't have to shoot too far.
8990856 8992482 What a woman!
9027101 9028268 Give me a quarter.
9028686 9030061 Let go of my horse!
9032398 9033898 Hold this horse.
9039947 9041614 - Let go!<br />- Give me that gun.
9044535 9046828 Help! Help!
9049206 9050457 Help!
9063471 9064721 Help!
9084492 9085492 Miss Scarlett!
9103427 9104469 Wait!
9104887 9106679 Miss Scarlett, wait!
9106889 9108264 Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
9108599 9110183 It's Sam!<br />- Big Sam?
9110851 9111935 Miss Scarlett, wait!
9114772 9116481 Sam! Sam!
9116690 9119818 Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br />Did they hurt you?
9120486 9124405 Don't you cry. Big Sam will get<br />you out of this in a jiffy.
9125199 9126908 Horse, make tracks!
9130329 9132539 Get to Tara as quick<br />as you can and stay there.
9132832 9135291 I will. I's had enough<br />of them Carpetbaggers.
9135543 9137544 Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br />Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
9137837 9139420 Goodbye, Sam. Thank you.
9139672 9142715 Change your dress and go over<br />to Miss Melly's.
9143008 9144676 I've got to go<br />to a political meeting.
9144927 9149556 How can you go to a political meeting<br />after what I've been through?
9149807 9152559 Oh, sugar.<br />You're more scared than hurt.
9152810 9154477 Nobody cares about me.
9154728 9157730 You all act as though<br />it were nothing at all.
9178752 9181337 The men talk<br />about protecting our women...
9181589 9185758 ...and then after what happened to me,<br />Frank went to a political meeting.
9189555 9192473 And if it won't pain you too much,<br />India Wilkes...
9192683 9196728 ...tell me why you're staring at me.<br />Has my face gone green?
9196937 9198271 It won't pain me.
9198564 9201065 What happened today<br />was just what you deserved.
9201275 9203234 With any justice,<br />you'd have gotten worse.
9203485 9206487 India, hush up.<br />- Let her talk. She's always hated me.
9206739 9210283 Ever since I took Charles away,<br />though she won't admit it.
9210576 9213536 If she thought anybody'd notice,<br />she'd walk the street naked.
9213746 9215788 I do hate you!
9216248 9219459 You've done all you could to lower<br />the prestige of decent people.
9219627 9221461 Now you've endangered<br />the lives of our men...
9221629 9223338 - ... because they've got to-<br />India!
9223505 9227258 We'd better not say any more,<br />or one of us will be saying too much.
9227468 9229969 What's going on<br />that I don't know about?
9230429 9231638 Shh!
9235809 9238978 Somebody's coming up the walk.<br />Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
9240439 9243149 Will you hand me the pistol,<br />Mrs. Meade?
9249406 9251074 Whoever it is...
9251617 9253326 ...we know nothing.
9256789 9260041 Where have they gone?<br />Tell me. It's life or death.
9260292 9262335 Don't tell him.<br />He's a Yankee spy.
9262586 9264170 Quickly. There may be time.
9265172 9267590 - How'd you know?<br />- I played poker with Yankees.
9267841 9270677 They knew there'd be trouble.<br />They sent the cavalry out.
9270928 9272762 Your men are walking<br />into a trap.
9273013 9275848 Don't tell him.<br />He's trying to trap you.
9278477 9281521 Out the Decatur road.<br />The old Sullivan plantation.
9281772 9283314 They're meeting in the cellar.
9283524 9285066 I'll do what I can.
9289697 9292740 What's this about?<br />If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy.
9292908 9294659 We thought it best not to tell you.
9294868 9298705 The men have gone to clean out<br />the woods where you were attacked.
9298998 9302166 It's what many of our Southern men<br />have had to do to protect us.
9302376 9306963 And if they're captured, they'll be<br />hanged. And it will be your fault.
9307214 9308965 Another word and you leave, India.
9309216 9311175 Scarlett did what she had to do.
9311385 9314220 Our men are doing<br />what they think they have to do.
9314847 9316139 Frank...
9316557 9318224 ...and Ashley.
9320185 9322603 Oh, it isn't possible.
9325399 9327859 There's horses, Miss Melly.<br />Here they come.
9328068 9330111 We're sewing, we're sewing!
9334491 9335533 Open the door.
9346003 9347837 Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
9350257 9351758 Who is Mrs. Wilkes?
9351925 9353676 I am Mrs. Wilkes.
9353886 9357180 - I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes.<br />- He's not here.
9357765 9360767 - Are you sure?<br />- Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word!
9361018 9363269 I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
9363437 9365772 If you give me your word,<br />I won't search the house.
9366148 9369942 Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting<br />at Mr. Kennedy's store.
9370152 9374405 He's not at the store. There's no<br />meeting tonight, no political meeting.
9374782 9377867 We'll wait outside till<br />he and his friends return.
9378911 9381746 Surround the house.<br />Put a man on each door and window.
9387544 9389962 Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
9390255 9392799 And I'll read aloud.
9396095 9399972 "The Personal History and Experience<br />of David Copperfield.
9402309 9403726 Chapter One.
9403936 9404977 I am born.
9409566 9413945 To begin my life with the beginning<br />of my life, I record that I was born... "
9414238 9416489 "Chapter Nine.<br />I have a memorable birthday.
9416782 9418741 I pass over all that happened<br />at school...
9418951 9422995 ...until the anniversary<br />of my birthday came round in March.
9423414 9426958 Except that Steerforth was more to be<br />admired than ever, I remember nothing.
9427334 9429502 He was going away<br />at the end of the half-year...
9429795 9434173 ...if not sooner, and was more<br />spirited and independent than before.
9436802 9439345 But beyond this,<br />I remember nothing.
9439638 9440847 The great-"
9443225 9444517 "I remember nothing. "
9449440 9451441 Melly, they're drunk!
9451942 9455778 Leave this to me, Scarlett.<br />And, please, say nothing.
9458866 9461284 - You stupid fool!<br />- Shh!
9462536 9463786 Quiet!
9464496 9466497 Will you shut up, for the love of-
9466665 9467748 Hello, Melly.
9467958 9472378 So you've got my husband<br />intoxicated again. Well, bring him in.
9472629 9474881 I'm sorry,<br />your husband's under arrest.
9475132 9479635 If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta,<br />you must arrest a good many Yankees.
9479845 9483389 Bring him in, Captain Butler,<br />if you can walk yourself.
9484516 9486058 - Wait.<br />- I wanna tell you a story.
9486351 9487685 Listen, doctor, I-
9487895 9489854 Put him down in that chair.
9493233 9495651 Now, captain,<br />please leave my house...
9495861 9498404 ...and try to remember<br />not to come here again.
9498655 9501491 That's fine thanks I get<br />for bringing him home...
9501700 9504368 ...and not leaving him<br />in this shameful condition.
9504578 9506287 Now, boys, all together-
9506497 9508331 Dr. Meade!
9508665 9510833 I'm astonished at you!
9516924 9518049 Oh, Ashley!
9518300 9520510 How can you do this to me?
9521386 9523846 I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
9524223 9526724 Take him to the bedroom.<br />Lay him out on the bed.
9526934 9529519 - Don't touch him. He's under arrest.<br />- Now, Tom.
9529770 9533439 What do you want to arrest him for?<br />I've seen him drunker.
9533732 9536108 I've seen you drunker.<br />And you've seen me-
9536401 9539820 He can lie in the gutter for all I care.<br />I'm not a policeman.
9540072 9544367 He led a raid on that Shantytown<br />where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble.
9544785 9547620 A lot of shanties were burned.<br />A couple of men were killed.
9547871 9551582 It's time you rebels learned you can't<br />take the law into your own hands.
9552042 9553876 What are you laughing at?
9555295 9557880 This isn't your night to teach<br />that lesson.
9558131 9560967 These two have been<br />with me tonight. Yes, sir.
9561260 9563052 With you, Rhett?
9563554 9564929 Where?
9568642 9570977 I don't like to say<br />in the presence of ladies.
9571562 9572645 You'd better say.
9573355 9575314 Come out on the porch<br />and I'll tell you.
9575482 9579318 Speak out. I think I have a right<br />to know where my husband's been.
9581655 9583072 Well, ma'am...
9583282 9585992 ...we dropped in on a friend of mine...
9586285 9587868 ...and the captain's.
9588078 9589412 A Mrs. Belle Watling.
9590664 9595418 We played cards<br />and drank champagne, and, well...
9595669 9599297 Now you've done it. Did you have<br />to show me up in front of my wife?
9600757 9602508 Now, I hope you're satisfied.
9602759 9605761 These ladies won't be speaking<br />with their husbands.
9606346 9609473 Well, Rhett, I had no idea.
9610851 9615980 Look here, will you take an oath that<br />they were with you tonight at Belle's?
9616398 9619275 Ask Belle if you don't believe me.<br />She'll tell you.
9619526 9621694 Will you give me your word,<br />as a gentleman?
9621945 9623154 As a gentleman?
9623405 9625406 Why, certainly, Tom.
9627367 9631162 Well, if I've made a mistake,<br />I'm sorry.
9631955 9634540 I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.
9636043 9637877 If you'll leave us in peace.
9638211 9640713 Well, I say I'm sorry.
9641965 9643382 Well, I am sorry.
9643634 9645217 Come on, sergeant.
9651933 9654393 Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
9654811 9656896 - Oh!<br />- Ashley!
9657147 9659398 He's all right.<br />It's only in the shoulder.
9659650 9662026 Get him on the bed<br />where I can dress the wound.
9662235 9664195 I think I can walk.
9664571 9666405 It's not worth the effort.<br />Which way?
9666657 9667948 In here.
9669368 9670910 Mammy, I want hot water.
9671328 9672745 And lint for bandages.
9672954 9675665 What can I use for a probe?<br />If I only had my bag.
9675916 9679001 Were you really there?<br />What did it look like?
9679252 9683172 Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br />plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
9683423 9686509 Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br />remember yourself.
9688553 9691847 Captain Butler, tell me what happened,<br />all that happened.
9692099 9693766 I was too late.
9694059 9697561 When I got to the Sullivan place,<br />there had already been a skirmish.
9697771 9700690 I found Mr. Wilkes wounded,<br />and Dr. Meade was with him.
9700899 9705069 I had to prove they'd been somewhere,<br />anyplace but where they were.
9705362 9708447 - So I took them to Belle's.<br />- And she took them in?
9708699 9711242 She's by way of being<br />an old friend of mine.
9711410 9713202 Oh, I'm sorry-
9713412 9716956 I'm sorry I couldn't think up<br />a more dignified alibi.
9720085 9723629 This isn't the first time you've come<br />between me and disaster.
9723880 9727383 It isn't likely that I'd question<br />any device of yours.
9728885 9732805 And now I'll go and see<br />what Dr. Meade needs.
9737811 9739395 Oh, Ashley...
9740939 9742606 Ashley...
9744067 9747319 Have you no interest in what's<br />become of your own husband?
9750282 9752616 Did Frank go with you<br />to Belle Watling's?
9752826 9754285 No.
9754578 9755619 Well, where is he?
9756621 9759290 He's lying out on Decatur Road...
9759583 9761584 ...shot through the head.
9762169 9763669 He's dead.
9773513 9774764 Who is it?
9775015 9776182 It's Mrs. Watling.
9776349 9779185 Oh, Mrs. Watling.<br />Won't you come in the house?
9779478 9782354 Oh, no, I couldn't do that,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
9782606 9785149 You come in and sit a minute with me.
9792949 9796702 How can I thank you enough<br />for what you did for us?
9796995 9799997 I got your note saying you would<br />call on me and thank me.
9800207 9803375 Why, Mrs. Wilkes,<br />you must have lost your mind.
9803668 9807671 I came as soon as it was dark to say<br />you mustn't think of any such thing.
9807881 9809548 Why, I'm...
9809841 9811217 Well, you're...
9811510 9813093 It wouldn't be fitting at all.
9813303 9817097 It wouldn't be fitting for me to thank<br />a woman who saved my husband's life?
9817349 9822228 Mrs. Wilkes, there ain't never been<br />a lady nice to me like you was.
9822479 9825189 I mean, about the money<br />for the hospital.
9825398 9827066 I don't forget a kindness.
9827567 9830402 I thought about you being widowed<br />with a little boy...
9830695 9832696 ...if Mr. Wilkes got hung.
9832906 9836242 He's a nice little boy,<br />your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes.
9836701 9839245 I got a boy myself, so I...
9839663 9842206 You have? Does he live-?
9842415 9845000 Oh, no, he ain't here in Atlanta.
9845418 9847127 He ain't never been here.
9847379 9849380 He's off at school.
9849756 9852258 I ain't seen him since he was little.
9854845 9858889 Anyways, if it had been that<br />Mrs. Kennedy's husband by hisself...
9859140 9862351 ...I wouldn't have lifted a finger,<br />no matter what Rhett said.
9862602 9864436 She's a mighty cold woman...
9864688 9867106 ...prancing about Atlanta by herself.
9867274 9870025 She killed her husband<br />same as if she shot him.
9870277 9873571 You mustn't say unkind things<br />about my sister-in-law.
9876575 9878701 Please don't freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes.
9878952 9881287 I forgot how you liked her.
9881788 9886292 She just ain't in the same class with you,<br />and I can't help it if I think so.
9886793 9889670 Well, anyways, I gotta be going.
9889921 9893632 I'm scared somebody'll recognize<br />this carriage if I stay any longer.
9893884 9896093 That wouldn't do you no good.
9896469 9899805 And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me<br />on the street...
9900056 9902308 ...you don't have to speak to me.
9902559 9904226 I'll understand.
9904477 9906729 I should be proud to speak to you.
9906938 9909440 Proud to be under obligation to you.
9909691 9911233 I hope we meet again.
9911484 9914570 Oh, no. That wouldn't be fitting.
9915947 9919241 - Good night, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />- Good night, Mrs. Watling.
9924205 9926123 And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
9926333 9929001 She's brokenhearted about her husband.
9972879 9974505 Great balls of fire!
9974756 9976173 It's Rhett.
10001491 10005995 Captain Butler's here.<br />I told him you was prostrate with grief.
10006246 10009748 Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
10039529 10041030 She says she's coming.
10041197 10043365 I don't know why she's coming,<br />but she's coming.
10043616 10044950 You don't like me, Mammy.
10045243 10048328 Don't you argue with me.<br />You don't. You really don't.
10060592 10062551 It's no good, Scarlett.
10062802 10065220 - What?<br />- The cologne.
10066097 10067639 I don't know what you mean.
10067891 10071935 I mean you've been drinking.<br />Brandy. Quite a lot.
10072145 10075439 Well, what if I have?<br />Is that any of your affair?
10077108 10078650 Don't drink alone.
10078943 10082863 People always find out,<br />and it ruins a reputation.
10088328 10091497 What is it?<br />This is more than losing old Frank.
10091664 10094625 Oh, Rhett, I'm so afraid.
10094876 10097377 I don't believe it.<br />You've never been afraid.
10097629 10099129 I'm afraid now.
10099380 10101340 I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
10103343 10106095 You look pretty healthy.<br />And maybe there isn't any hell.
10106304 10110265 Oh, there is. I know there is.<br />I was raised on it.
10110475 10113644 Far be it from me to question<br />the teachings of childhood.
10114187 10117773 Tell me what you've done<br />that hell yawns before you.
10118441 10120943 I ought never to have married Frank.
10121194 10124363 He was Suellen's beau,<br />and he loved her, not me.
10124614 10127616 And I made him miserable,<br />and I killed him.
10127867 10130285 Yes, I did. I killed him.
10131704 10133831 Rhett, for the first time...
10134040 10137793 ...I'm finding out what it is<br />to be sorry for something I've done.
10138503 10140879 Here. Dry your eyes.
10141631 10144508 If you had it all to do over again,<br />you'd do no differently.
10144717 10147386 You're like the thief<br />who isn't sorry he stole...
10147554 10149930 ...but he's terribly sorry<br />he's going to jail.
10150181 10152933 I'm glad Mother's dead.
10153184 10156562 I'm glad she's dead<br />so she can't see me.
10156729 10160524 I always wanted to be like her,<br />calm and kind...
10160733 10164069 ...and sadly, I've turned out<br />disappointing.
10165155 10169700 You know, Scarlett, I think<br />you're on the verge of a crying jag.
10176666 10179751 So I'll change the subject<br />and say what I came to say.
10180003 10182004 Say it, then, and get out!
10183006 10186550 - What is it?<br />- I can't go on any longer without you.
10186718 10190762 Oh! You really are the most ill-bred man<br />to come here at a time-
10191014 10193724 I made up my mind you were<br />the only woman for me...
10193975 10195392 ...the first day I saw you.
10195602 10197603 Now you have a mill<br />and Frank's money...
10197896 10200105 ...and won't come to me<br />as you did to the jail.
10200356 10204735 - So I see I shall have to marry you.<br />- I never heard of such bad taste.
10204944 10207070 Would you be convinced<br />if I fell to my knees?
10207447 10209031 Turn me loose and get out.
10209282 10212242 Forgive me for startling you<br />with my impetuous sentiments...
10212493 10214995 ...my dear Scarlett-<br />I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
10215246 10218207 But you must have noticed<br />that for some time...
10218458 10221752 ...the friendship I've felt for you<br />has ripened into a deeper feeling.
10222003 10226215 A feeling more beautiful,<br />more pure, more sacred...
10226424 10228550 Dare I name it? Can it be love?
10229219 10231637 Get up off your knees.<br />I don't like your common jokes.
10231930 10233931 This is an honorable proposal<br />of marriage...
10234140 10237142 ...made at what I consider<br />a most opportune moment.
10237310 10240646 I can't go all my life waiting<br />to catch you between husbands.
10240897 10243899 You're coarse and you're conceited.
10244108 10247069 And I think this conversation's<br />gone far enough.
10247612 10250447 Besides, I shall never marry again.
10251074 10253909 Oh, yes, you will.<br />And you'll marry me.
10254160 10256161 You? You?
10256663 10258288 I don't love you.
10258539 10261458 And I don't like being married.
10261668 10263919 Ever think of marrying<br />just for fun?
10264170 10265587 Marriage, fun?
10265797 10268507 Fiddle-dee-dee!<br />Fun for men, you mean.
10268758 10270300 Do you want them to hear you?
10270551 10272803 You've been married<br />to a boy and an old man.
10273054 10276682 Why not try a husband of the right age,<br />with a way with women?
10276933 10279142 You're a fool, Rhett Butler...
10279352 10282479 ...when you know I shall always love<br />another man.
10282772 10284982 Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.
10285191 10287067 No more of that talk.
10292448 10293782 Don't. I shall faint.
10294033 10296702 I want you to faint.<br />This is what you're meant for.
10296953 10299496 None of those fools<br />have kissed you like this.
10299706 10303125 Your Charles or your Frank<br />or your stupid Ashley.
10310883 10313969 Say you're going to marry me.<br />Say yes. Say yes.
10314220 10315637 Yes.
10317390 10320058 Are you sure you meant it?<br />You don't want to take it back?
10320226 10321518 No.
10321728 10324229 Look at me,<br />and try to tell me the truth.
10324480 10326898 Did you say yes because of my money?
10327191 10330068 Well, yes, partly.
10331070 10332321 Partly?
10332739 10335240 Well, you know, Rhett,<br />money does help.
10335533 10338618 - And, of course, I am fond of you.<br />- Fond of me?
10338870 10342331 If I said I was madly in love<br />with you, you'd know I was lying.
10342540 10346209 - You say we have a lot in common-<br />- Yes, you're right, my dear.
10346419 10348587 I'm not in love<br />any more than you are.
10348755 10351548 Heaven help the man<br />who ever really loves you.
10351758 10353592 What kind of ring would you like?
10353843 10356762 A diamond ring,<br />and do buy a great big one.
10357013 10360057 You'll have the biggest<br />and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
10360266 10363935 I'll take you to New Orleans<br />for the most expensive honeymoon.
10364187 10367606 - That'd be heavenly.<br />- I'll buy your trousseau for you too.
10367857 10369941 How wonderful...
10370234 10372611 ...but you won't tell anybody,<br />will you?
10372862 10375280 Still the little hypocrite.
10377241 10379034 Won't you kiss me goodbye?
10379285 10381787 You've had enough kissing<br />for one afternoon.
10382038 10385415 You're impossible. You can go.<br />I don't care if you never come back.
10385666 10387584 But I will come back.
10401974 10403892 What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
10404143 10406770 I'm thinking about how rich we are.
10408064 10410148 I can keep the lumber business too?
10410400 10412818 Yes, of course you can,<br />if it amuses you.
10413069 10417197 Now that you're so rich, you can tell<br />everybody to go to the devil.
10417407 10420492 But you were the main one<br />I wanted to go to the devil.
10437802 10441346 Don't scrape the plate.<br />I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
10441514 10445434 Oh, Rhett, can I have<br />a chocolate one stuffed with meringue?
10445685 10448728 If you don't stop being a glutton,<br />you'll get as fat as Mammy.
10448980 10450605 And I'll divorce you.
10451315 10453733 It'd be nice if you bought<br />something for Mammy.
10453985 10457487 Why should I buy her a present<br />when she called us both mules?
10457738 10459156 Mules? Why mules?
10459365 10463952 She said we could give ourselves air<br />and get slicked up like racehorses...
10464203 10467873 ...but we were just mules in horse<br />harness and we didn't fool anybody.
10468166 10471668 I never heard anything more true.<br />Mammy's a smart old soul.
10471878 10475797 And one of the few people I know<br />whose respect I'd like to have.
10476382 10479968 - I won't give her a thing.<br />- Then I'll take her a petticoat.
10480178 10482304 My mammy said<br />when she went to heaven...
10482472 10486558 ...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat<br />so stiff that it'd stand by itself...
10486809 10489769 ...and so rustley the Lord would say<br />it's made of angels' wings.
10489979 10492814 She won't take it from you.<br />She'd rather die than wear it.
10493065 10496651 That may be. But I'm making<br />the gesture just the same.
10500490 10502908 Wake up. Wake up!
10504410 10506870 You were having another nightmare.
10507413 10508872 Oh, Rhett.
10509040 10513168 Rhett, I was so cold<br />and hungry and so tired.
10513419 10517923 I couldn't find it. I ran through<br />the mist and I couldn't find it.
10518216 10520842 - Find what, honey?<br />- I don't know.
10521052 10523929 I always dream the same dream,<br />and I never know.
10524180 10526181 It seems to be hidden in the mist.
10526432 10527933 Darling...
10528601 10533563 Oh, Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream<br />that I found it, and that I'm safe?
10534065 10536066 Dreams don't work that way.
10536317 10538568 But when you get used<br />to being safe and warm...
10538778 10540904 ...you'll stop dreaming that dream.
10541113 10544908 And, Scarlett, I'm going to see<br />that you are safe.
10546285 10550872 Rhett, would you do something for me<br />if I asked you?
10551123 10552958 You know I would.
10553584 10555710 Will you take me away from here?
10556128 10559631 - Don't you like New Orleans?<br />- I love New Orleans...
10559840 10562467 ...but I want to go home<br />and visit Tara.
10562718 10564844 Will you take me to Tara?
10565096 10567889 Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will.
10568641 10570475 We'll go tomorrow.
10572979 10575647 You get your strength<br />from this red earth of Tara.
10575898 10577649 You're part of it<br />and it's part of you.
10577942 10581570 I'd give anything to have Tara<br />the way it was before the war.
10581821 10582988 Would you?
10583364 10586366 Go ahead and make it that way.<br />Spend whatever you want.
10586617 10588910 Make it as fine a plantation<br />as it ever was.
10589078 10590829 Oh, Rhett!
10591163 10592789 Rhett, you are good to me.
10592999 10595166 Can we still have our big new house<br />in Atlanta?
10595459 10598169 Yes. And it can be<br />as ornate as you want.
10598421 10600672 Marble terraces,<br />stained-glass windows.
10600965 10602632 Won't everyone be jealous!
10602883 10606970 I want everybody who's been mean<br />to me to be pea-green with envy.
10607847 10609681 I don't care. Scarlett's hateful...
10609974 10612183 ...building that new house<br />just to show off!
10612393 10615103 And even taking our servants!
10615354 10618481 Oh, darling, you mustn't think<br />unkindly of her.
10618691 10621526 She's made it possible for us<br />to keep Tara, always.
10621819 10623653 Yes, and what good is Tara?
10623904 10628450 She's had three husbands,<br />and I'll be an old maid!
10630411 10632662 Great Jehoshaphat!
10633122 10634873 Great Jehoshaphat!
10635333 10638043 Lordy, we sure is rich now.
10639003 10641504 That's ridiculous!<br />Why can't I go in?
10641672 10644299 I'm entitled to at least see<br />what my own child looks like.
10644508 10648219 You control yourself.<br />You'll be seeing it for a long time.
10648846 10651640 I'd like to apologize<br />about its not being a boy.
10651891 10653933 Oh, hush your mouth.<br />Who wants a boy?
10654185 10657187 Boys aren't any use.<br />Don't you think I'm proof of that?
10658064 10659898 Have a drink of sherry.
10660066 10662442 Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
10662693 10664736 She sure is.
10665029 10666571 You ever see a prettier one?
10666822 10671201 Miss Scarlett was mighty near that<br />pretty when she come, but not quite.
10671452 10672869 Have another glass.
10675414 10677040 Mammy?
10677249 10679084 What's that rustling noise I hear?
10679377 10683421 Lordy, that ain't nothing but my<br />red silk petticoat you done give me.
10683589 10687717 Nothing but your petticoat?<br />I don't believe it. Pull up your skirt.
10688552 10691012 Mr. Rhett, you is bad.
10691222 10693264 Yea, Lordy!
10698270 10701106 You sure took a long enough time<br />about wearing it.
10701482 10703733 Yes, sir. Too long.
10703943 10705944 No more mule in horse's harness?
10706195 10709197 Mister Rhett, Miss Scarlett<br />was bad telling you about that.
10709448 10712075 You ain't holding that<br />against old Mammy, is you?
10712493 10713993 I don't hold it against you.
10714245 10716454 I just wanted to know.<br />Have another glass.
10716622 10718123 Here, take the whole bottle.
10718290 10721459 Dr. Meade says you can go in now,<br />Captain Butler.
10724630 10726715 This sure is a happy day to me.
10726966 10730009 I done diapered three generations<br />of this family's girls.
10730219 10732137 And it sure is a happy day.
10732388 10737308 Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days<br />are when babies come. I wish-
10737643 10740812 Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.<br />What do you suppose they'll name her?
10741105 10743148 Miss Scarlett done told me<br />if it was a girl...
10743441 10747318 ...she was going to name it<br />Eugenia Victoria.
10747486 10751114 Yes, she's a beautiful baby.
10751323 10753825 The most beautiful baby ever.
10754410 10756119 Yes...
10757580 10760290 Do you know that this is<br />your birthday?
10760541 10763001 That you're a week old today?
10763294 10767046 Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony,<br />the likes of which...
10767256 10769007 ...this town has never seen.
10769258 10772761 Yes, I'm going to send her to<br />the best schools in Charleston.
10773012 10777557 Yes, and her will be received by<br />the best families in the South.
10777767 10780059 And when it comes time<br />for her to marry...
10780311 10783855 ...well, she'll be a little princess.
10784106 10786149 Certainly making a fool of yourself.
10786358 10787567 Why shouldn't I?
10788694 10792572 She's the first person who's ever<br />completely belonged to me.
10793032 10794574 Great balls of fire!
10794825 10796659 I had the baby, didn't I?
10797203 10799704 It's Melanie. May I come in?<br />- Come in.
10800039 10804459 Yes, come in and look at<br />my daughter's beautiful blue eyes.
10805795 10808379 Most babies have blue eyes<br />when they're born.
10808672 10811466 Don't tell him anything.<br />He knows everything about babies.
10811675 10814803 Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br />and they'll stay blue.
10815054 10817597 As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.
10817973 10819974 That's it.<br />That's what we'll call her.
10820476 10822393 "Bonnie Blue Butler. "
10830402 10832195 Try again, Mammy.
10839703 10840995 Twenty inches.
10841247 10844707 Twenty inches.<br />I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
10844917 10847252 You simply gotta make it 181/2 again.
10847503 10848878 You done had a baby.
10849129 10851923 And you ain't never gonna be<br />no 181/2 inches again.
10852174 10854092 There ain't nothing to do about it.
10855177 10857053 There is something to do about it.
10857263 10860557 I'm just not going to get old and fat<br />before my time.
10861058 10863434 I just won't have any more babies.
10863936 10867438 I heard Mr. Rhett say<br />that he'd be wanting a son next year.
10867731 10870400 Tell Captain Butler I decided<br />not to go out.
10870651 10872443 I'll have supper in my room.
10893048 10894757 I got your message.
10894967 10897677 I'll have them bring<br />my supper up here too.
10903684 10905393 No objections to that, I hope?
10905603 10906811 No.
10907980 10909981 Yes.
10911066 10913943 I mean, I don't care<br />where you have your supper.
10915988 10917113 Rhett...
10917948 10920408 Yes?<br />- You see...
10920618 10922827 Well, I've decided...
10924496 10927415 Well, I hope I don't have<br />any more children.
10939637 10943181 My pet, as I told you<br />before Bonnie was born...
10943432 10946309 ...it's immaterial to me<br />whether you have one child or 20.
10946518 10948353 No, but you know what I...
10948812 10950229 Do you know what I mean?
10950481 10954359 I do. And do you know<br />I can divorce you for this?
10954860 10956861 You're low enough to think of that.
10957154 10959656 If you had any chivalry in you,<br />or were nice...
10959865 10964202 Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can't<br />have any more children and he...
10965829 10968373 You've been to the lumber office<br />this afternoon.
10968624 10970458 What has that got to do with it?
10971877 10975254 Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br />Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.
10975506 10978383 It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
10978884 10982053 - You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.<br />- Sorry for me?
10982304 10985515 Yes, sorry for you because you throw<br />away happiness with both hands...
10985683 10988226 ...and reach out for something<br />that'll never make you happy.
10988394 10990019 I don't know<br />what you're talking about.
10990187 10994482 If you were free and Melly were dead<br />and you had your precious Ashley...
10994733 10996734 ...do you think you'd be happy?
10997319 11000905 You'd never know him,<br />never even understand his mind...
11001156 11003992 ...any more than you understand<br />anything, except money.
11004493 11006077 Never mind about that. I want-
11006370 11010498 You may keep your sanctity.<br />It'll work no hardship on me.
11010749 11012000 You don't care?
11012376 11014585 The world is full<br />of many things and people...
11014837 11018423 ...and I shan't be lonely.<br />I will find comfort elsewhere.
11018674 11019882 Well, that's fine.
11020092 11023678 But I warn you, in case you change<br />your mind, I intend to lock my door.
11023887 11025013 Why bother?
11025264 11028433 If I wanted to come in,<br />no lock could keep me out.
11045951 11047618 I knew most women were cheats...
11047911 11050121 ...hypocritical and hard,<br />but this one...
11050414 11052623 - It ain't no use.<br />- What do you mean?
11052916 11054751 I mean you're poisoned with her.
11054960 11058463 I don't care what she's done to you.<br />You're still in love with her.
11058714 11063051 - It pleasures me none to say it.<br />- Maybe so, but I'm through with her.
11063302 11067221 You've gotta think of the child.<br />Child's worth 10 of the mother.
11073270 11074979 You're a shrewd woman, Belle.
11075147 11076981 And a very nice one.
11077983 11078983 Yes, Rhett?
11079234 11082653 I was just thinking of the difference<br />between you and...
11082863 11085656 You're both hardheaded businesswomen,<br />and successful.
11086366 11088493 But you've got a heart, Belle.
11089995 11091829 And you're honest.
11094083 11095249 Goodbye, Rhett.
11096794 11098086 Goodbye, Belle.
11113685 11116020 She'll be a wonderful horsewoman.
11116188 11118189 Look at those hands. And that seat!
11118482 11119816 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
11120025 11122693 Why we have to wheel a baby<br />when we have servants-
11122903 11125863 - Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.<br />Captain Butler.
11126031 11127156 Good morning, Scarlett.
11127324 11130034 Making fools of ourselves<br />in front of these buffaloes.
11130285 11132829 If you'd thought of your position,<br />you wouldn't have to.
11133038 11138126 But as it is, we're going to cultivate<br />every female dragon of the Old Guard-
11138335 11141462 - Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.<br />Captain Butler.
11141713 11143673 Good morning, Scarlett.
11143924 11147051 So the millionaire speculator<br />is turning respectable.
11147302 11149387 Money can't buy<br />what I want for Bonnie.
11149638 11151722 I'll admit I've been at fault too.
11151974 11154058 Bonnie will have a place<br />among decent people.
11154351 11158563 Even if we both have to crawl<br />on our bellies to every fat old cat-
11158856 11160648 Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
11160858 11164402 Good morning, Captain<br />Butler. Good morning, Scarlett.
11169825 11172743 Mrs. Merriwether, I have<br />great regard for your knowledge.
11173036 11175580 - Could you give me some advice?<br />- Why, certainly.
11175747 11177999 My Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br />I can't stop her.
11178250 11180918 You should make her stop!<br />It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
11181086 11183838 I know, I know.<br />She has such a beautiful mouth too.
11184089 11186591 - I tried putting soap on her nails.<br />Soap? Bah!
11186842 11190386 Put quinine on her thumb and<br />she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
11190596 11193222 Quinine! I never would have<br />thought of it.
11193473 11195391 I can't thank you enough.
11195601 11198102 You've taken a great load off my mind.
11198353 11199604 Good morning.
11202441 11205401 Good morning, Dolly.<br />Wasn't that Captain Butler?
11205611 11208279 Good morning, Caroline.<br />I was just thinking...
11208572 11212575 ...there's a great deal of good in<br />a man who would love a child so much.
11212784 11214785 But of course there is.
11215037 11219248 Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that<br />Captain Butler finally admitted...
11219458 11223252 ...that he was honored for his<br />services at the Battle of Franklin.
11223503 11225963 No, and did I tell you<br />that Captain Butler made...
11226215 11230509 ...a stupendous contribution to the<br />Association for the Beautification...
11230719 11233012 - ... of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?<br />- No!
11234139 11237808 My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,<br />is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
11238101 11242230 Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was<br />my idea to give a party for Bonnie.
11242481 11246150 Why, Caroline Meade,<br />how can you say a thing like that?
11252908 11256327 Watch Daddy put your pony<br />over it, Bonnie. Now, watch!
11259122 11261290 Daddy, let me! Let me!
11261500 11262750 All right, darling.
11263001 11264669 Put her on, Pork.
11267631 11268798 Up we go!
11269049 11270132 Oh, there!
11270759 11273135 Lordy mercy!<br />There he goes again.
11273345 11276347 Grip tightly with your legs.<br />Lean forward and go with him.
11276598 11279517 Hold your reins properly<br />in a firm hand. Up!
11280602 11282853 That was fine. I knew you'd do it.
11283146 11285773 When you're older,<br />I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
11286024 11290152 You'll be the best horsewoman<br />in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
11290696 11292280 Mr. Rhett? Mr. Rhett!
11293115 11294156 Mr. Rhett!
11295200 11297535 Did you see her?<br />Wasn't she wonderful?
11297786 11300288 Mr. Rhett, I done told you<br />and told you...
11300539 11304458 ...it just ain't fittin' for a girl to ride<br />astraddle with her dress flying up.
11305043 11307211 All right. I'll teach her<br />to ride sidesaddle.
11307462 11310506 And I'll buy her a blue velvet<br />riding habit. She'll love that.
11310799 11313092 A nice black broadcloth<br />is what little girls wear.
11313343 11315594 Oh, now, Mammy,<br />be reasonable.
11315804 11318723 Well, I don't think it's fittin', but...
11320100 11322685 It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.
11323979 11325604 It ain't fittin'.
11335407 11339243 Why, Scarlett, what are you<br />doing downtown at this time of day?
11339411 11340411 Well, Ashley, I just-
11340662 11343914 Why aren't you helping Melly<br />with my surprise birthday party?
11344207 11347710 Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't<br />supposed to know anything about that.
11347919 11350629 Melly'd be so disappointed<br />if you weren't surprised.
11350881 11352089 I won't let on.
11352257 11354717 I'll be the most surprised man<br />in Atlanta.
11354885 11357219 As long as you're here,<br />let me show you the books...
11357387 11359930 ...so you can see how bad<br />a businessman I am.
11360182 11363768 Don't let's fool with any books today.<br />When I'm wearing a new bonnet...
11364061 11366937 ...all the figures I ever knew<br />go right out of my head.
11367189 11370441 Figures are well lost when<br />the bonnet's as pretty as that.
11370734 11374445 Scarlett, you know,<br />you get prettier all the time.
11374696 11378783 You haven't changed a bit since<br />our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
11379076 11382536 ...where you sat under a tree<br />surrounded by dozens of beaus.
11384081 11386457 That girl doesn't exist anymore.
11387125 11391087 Nothing's turned out as I expected,<br />Ashley. Nothing.
11391755 11395883 Yes, we've traveled a long road<br />since the old days, haven't we?
11396093 11397718 Oh, the lazy days...
11397969 11400888 ...the warm, still,<br />country twilight...
11401390 11404475 ...the high, soft Negro laughter<br />from the quarters...
11405310 11409480 ...the golden warmth and security<br />of those days.
11410816 11412775 Don't look back, Ashley.
11412984 11414819 Don't look back.
11416196 11418614 It drags at your heart till...
11418907 11421242 ...you can't do anything<br />but look back.
11426081 11428416 I didn't mean to make you sad,<br />my dear.
11429418 11433212 I never want you to be anything<br />but completely happy.
11452858 11454191 Oh, Ashley!
11456445 11459280 - Who is it?<br />Only your husband.
11459865 11461365 Come in.
11461950 11465327 Am I actually being invited<br />into the sanctuary?
11466163 11468247 You're not ready for Melanie's party.
11468457 11469748 I've got a headache, Rhett.
11470000 11473461 You go without me<br />and make my excuses to Melanie.
11474504 11477256 What a white-livered<br />little coward you are!
11477507 11480468 Get up! You're going to that party<br />and you'll have to hurry.
11480677 11482261 - Has India dared-?<br />- Yes, India has.
11482512 11485806 - Everyone in town knows the story.<br />- Kill them for spreading lies.
11486057 11488684 I don't kill people who tell the truth.
11488894 11489977 No time to argue.
11490228 11493481 I won't go! I can't go until<br />this misunderstanding clears up.
11493732 11497359 You won't cheat Melly out of publicly<br />ordering you out of her house.
11497569 11501197 There was nothing wrong.<br />India hates me so. I can't go.
11501406 11504867 If you don't show your face tonight,<br />you'll never be able to again.
11505076 11507661 I don't care, but you won't ruin<br />Bonnie's chances.
11507913 11510789 You're going to that party,<br />for her sake. Get dressed.
11524804 11528516 Wear that. Nothing modest<br />or matronly will do for this occasion.
11528725 11532686 And put on plenty of rouge.<br />I want you to look your part tonight.
11539069 11541612 For he's a jolly good fellow
11541905 11544073 For he's a jolly good fellow
11544324 11547284 For he's a jolly good fellow
11547452 11549620 Which nobody can deny
11549871 11552081 Which nobody can deny
11552332 11554416 Which nobody can deny
11558630 11560881 - Good night, Scarlett.<br />- But, Rhett-
11561132 11563968 You're going into the arena alone.<br />The lions are hungry.
11564261 11565761 Don't leave me. Don't.
11565971 11567721 You're not afraid?
11593873 11596083 What a lovely dress, darling.
11596334 11599003 India wasn't able to come.<br />Will you be an angel?
11599296 11603173 I do need you to help me<br />receive my guests.
11605635 11607136 Mrs. Meade...
11607429 11609638 ...here's our darling Scarlett.
11610974 11613142 - Good evening.<br />- Good evening.
11613476 11615603 - Why, Scarlett.<br />- Good evening.
11618898 11622776 Ashley, aren't you going to get<br />our Scarlett a glass of punch?
11629993 11632828 Did you have a good time<br />at Miss Melly's party?
11633038 11635706 Yes. Now, Mammy,<br />be sure and leave word.
11635999 11639335 If Captain Butler asks for me<br />when he comes back, I'm asleep.
11639544 11640669 Yes'm.
11669991 11672201 Come in, Mrs. Butler.
11680752 11682211 Come here.
11697686 11699103 Sit down.
11701564 11705067 No reason you shouldn't<br />have a nightcap, even if I am here.
11705276 11707236 I didn't want a drink.<br />I heard a noise-
11707487 11709571 You heard nothing of the kind.
11709781 11712449 You wouldn't have come<br />if you thought I was here.
11712701 11714785 - You must need a drink badly.<br />- I do not.
11714994 11717621 Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
11717914 11721208 I know you drink on the quiet,<br />and I know how much you drink.
11721418 11724294 Do you think I care<br />if you like your brandy?
11730885 11733762 - You're drunk and I'm going to bed.<br />- I'm very drunk...
11734013 11737725 ...and I intend getting still drunker<br />before the evening's over.
11737976 11739810 But you're not going to bed.
11740061 11741645 Not yet.
11741938 11743313 Sit down.
11746317 11749153 So she stood by you, did she?
11749446 11753407 How's it feel to have the woman<br />you've wronged cloak your sins?
11754784 11757745 You're wondering if she knows<br />all about you and Ashley.
11757996 11760998 You're wondering if she did it<br />just to save face.
11761166 11764793 You're thinking she's a fool for doing it,<br />even if it saved your hide-
11765044 11767671 - I will not listen.<br />- Yes, you'll listen.
11768173 11771258 Miss Melly's a fool,<br />but not the kind you think.
11771509 11776638 She has too much honor to conceive<br />of dishonor in anyone she loves.
11776931 11778974 And she loves you.
11779184 11782186 Though just why she does,<br />I'm sure I don't know.
11783188 11786690 If you weren't so drunk and insulting,<br />I could explain everything.
11786983 11790444 - As it is, though-<br />- You get out of that chair once more...
11794199 11799369 Of course, the comic figure in all this<br />is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
11799871 11803373 Mr. Wilkes, who can't be<br />mentally faithful to his wife...
11803583 11806502 ...and won't be unfaithful to her<br />technically.
11807378 11810672 - Why doesn't he make up his mind?<br />- Rhett, you-
11813676 11816386 Observe my hands, my dear.
11817096 11819848 I could tear you to pieces with them.
11820225 11824311 And I'd do it if it'd take<br />Ashley out of your mind forever.
11824854 11826313 But it wouldn't.
11827190 11831610 So I'll remove him<br />from your mind forever, this way.
11832237 11834655 I'll put my hands so.
11835073 11837991 One on each side of your head.
11838243 11842830 And I'll smash your skull<br />between them like a walnut.
11843081 11845249 And that'll block him out.
11846626 11849878 Take your hands off me,<br />you drunken fool!
11854676 11858220 You know, I've always admired<br />your spirit, my dear.
11858763 11861598 Never more than now,<br />when you're cornered.
11862267 11863433 I'm not cornered.
11863685 11866353 You'll never corner me or frighten me.
11866604 11869940 You've lived in dirt so long,<br />you can't understand anything else.
11870191 11873235 You're jealous of something<br />you can't understand.
11873444 11874695 Good night.
11876447 11877781 Jealous, am I?
11878032 11880200 Yes, I suppose I am.
11880451 11883787 Even though I know you've been<br />faithful to me all along.
11884038 11885163 How do I know?
11885415 11888876 Because I know Ashley Wilkes<br />and his honorable breed.
11889085 11890752 They're gentlemen.
11890962 11894298 That's more than I can say<br />for you or for me.
11894591 11898760 We're not gentlemen.<br />And we have no honor, have we?
11907729 11909938 It's not that easy, Scarlett.
11914068 11917988 You turn me out while you chase Ashley,<br />while you dream of Ashley.
11918239 11920991 This is one night<br />you're not turning me out.
11948728 11950729 How are you feeling this morning?
11950980 11953732 Well, this misery in my back...
11953942 11955609 ...ain't so good.
11957946 11960238 You act mighty happy this morning.
11960490 11962699 I am, Mammy. I am.
11969040 11974169 Oh, she wept with delight<br />When he gave her a smile
11974462 11979341 And trembled with fear at his frown
11995900 11997317 Hello.
11998277 11999653 I,...
11999821 12003073 I'd like to extend my apology<br />for my conduct of last night.
12003658 12004825 Oh, but, Rhett.
12005326 12007411 I was very drunk...
12007745 12010330 ...and quite swept off my feet<br />by your charms.
12012500 12015836 You needn't bother to apologize.<br />Nothing you do surprises me.
12016379 12020590 I've been thinking, and I believe<br />it would be better for both of us...
12020842 12023593 ...if we admitted we made a mistake<br />and got a divorce.
12023886 12025262 - A divorce?<br />- Yes.
12025513 12027931 There's no point in holding on<br />to each other.
12028224 12030559 I'll provide for you.<br />You've plenty of grounds.
12030810 12033437 Just give me Bonnie,<br />and you can say what you please.
12033688 12037941 Thank you, but I wouldn't dream of<br />disgracing the family with a divorce.
12038609 12041028 You'd disgrace it<br />if Ashley were free.
12041279 12044573 Makes my head spin to think<br />how quickly you'd divorce me.
12045033 12046074 Wouldn't you?
12048119 12049870 Answer me. Wouldn't you?
12050538 12052456 Please go now and leave me alone.
12054292 12056460 I'm going. That's what I came<br />to tell you.
12057587 12059963 I'm going on a very extended trip<br />to London.
12060256 12061965 - And I'm leaving today.<br />- Oh.
12062341 12066386 I'm taking Bonnie with me.<br />Please get her duds packed right away.
12066637 12069056 You'll never take my child<br />out of this house.
12069265 12073060 She's my child too. You're mistaken<br />if you think I'm leaving her here...
12073311 12075937 ...with a mother who doesn't<br />consider her reputation.
12076147 12077856 You're a fine one to talk.
12078066 12082486 You think I'll let her out when you'll<br />have her around people like Belle?
12083404 12085947 If you were a man,<br />I'd break your neck for that.
12086157 12088158 I'll thank you to shut your mouth.
12088409 12091078 As for you giving yourself airs<br />about motherhood...
12091329 12093371 ...a cat's a better mother<br />than you are.
12093623 12096500 Have her things packed for me<br />in an hour, or I warn you...
12096751 12100504 ...I've always thought a lashing with<br />a whip would benefit you immensely.
12106094 12107385 Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
12108346 12110680 - Hello, Uncle Rhett.<br />- Hello, Beau.
12110932 12115977 Daddy, where have you been?<br />I've been waiting for you all morning.
12116187 12119856 I've been hunting for a rabbit skin<br />to wrap my little Bonnie in.
12120108 12122025 Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
12124153 12128949 Bonnie, I'm going to take you<br />on a long trip to fairyland.
12129367 12131118 Where? Where?
12131369 12134704 I'll show you the Tower of London,<br />where the little princes were...
12134997 12136832 ...and London Bridge.
12137041 12140669 London Bridge?<br />Will it be falling down?
12141796 12144422 Well, it will<br />if you want it to, darling.
12146717 12149970 Daddy, dark!
12150221 12151721 Dark!
12152140 12154182 Bonnie! Bonnie!
12154976 12158311 It's all right, Bonnie.<br />Who put out that light? Nurse!
12160481 12163567 Daddy, dark!<br />Yes, yes, yes...
12163818 12165735 What's the matter with my Bonnie?
12165987 12167529 A bear!
12167738 12170031 Oh, a bear? A big bear?
12170241 12171575 Dreadful big!
12171742 12173869 And he sat on my chest!
12174078 12177497 I'll stay here and shoot him<br />if he comes back.
12191762 12193972 Oh, good evening, Mr. Butler.
12196601 12199394 I told you never to leave<br />this child alone in the dark.
12199604 12203231 Children are often afraid of the dark,<br />but they get over it.
12203441 12205066 Let her scream for a night-
12205276 12206484 Let her scream?
12206694 12209029 Either you're a fool<br />or an inhuman woman.
12209280 12211740 If you want her to grow up cowardly-
12211991 12215368 Cowardly? There isn't<br />a cowardly bone in her body.
12215620 12217245 You're discharged.
12217496 12219206 As you say, sir.
12235640 12237140 Where's Mother?
12239977 12241144 Bonnie...
12243731 12245732 Aren't you happy here<br />in London with me?
12246484 12249527 I wanna go home.
12261165 12265669 Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!<br />Miss Scarlett!
12265836 12266920 Hello, Mammy!
12267171 12268964 Honey child!
12269840 12274678 Miss Scarlett, they's back.<br />They's back!
12274845 12276930 Bonnie! Bonnie, baby.
12277181 12279683 Darling baby!<br />You glad to be home?
12279976 12281851 Daddy gave me a kitten.
12282103 12286022 But London's a horrid place.
12286190 12289359 Where's my pony?<br />I wanna go out and see my pony.
12289610 12291820 You go out and see your pony.
12300538 12302539 Where's my pony?
12303207 12305166 I want to go out and see my pony.
12305710 12307377 You run along with Mammy.
12307628 12312132 Come on, honey child.<br />Mammy sure missed you, honey.
12313217 12315468 Mrs. Butler, I believe.
12315845 12318179 Mammy said you'd come back.
12318514 12319806 Only to bring Bonnie.
12320224 12324227 Apparently any mother,<br />even a bad one, is better than none.
12324395 12326021 You mean you're going away again?
12326605 12329232 What perception, Mrs. Butler.<br />Right away.
12329734 12332819 - In fact, I left my bags at the station.<br />- Oh.
12333904 12336990 You're looking pale.<br />Is there a shortage of rouge?
12337241 12340327 Or can this wanness mean<br />you've been missing me?
12340578 12341995 If I'm pale, it's your fault.
12342246 12345498 Not because I've been<br />missing you, but because...
12349003 12351338 Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
12351839 12354591 It's because I'm going to have a baby.
12360056 12363224 Indeed. And who's the happy father?
12364101 12367270 You know it's yours.<br />I don't want it any more than you do.
12367563 12370273 No woman would want the child<br />of a cad like you.
12370524 12373234 I wish it were anybody's<br />child but yours!
12374445 12377405 Well, cheer up.<br />Maybe you'll have an accident.
12391587 12393254 Is she better?
12397176 12398385 Has she asked for me?
12398636 12401596 Don't you understand?<br />She's delirious.
12402431 12405058 Rhett...
12405309 12407268 I want Rhett!
12411190 12414484 What's the matter, honey?<br />Did you call somebody, child?
12414777 12419322 It's no use. It's no use!
12440803 12442846 Dr. Meade's left.
12443347 12446850 - Scarlett's dead.<br />- Oh, no, she's much better.
12447017 12448935 Really she is.
12465244 12468121 There, there, Captain Butler,<br />you're beside yourself.
12468330 12471291 She'll very soon be well again.<br />I promise you.
12471500 12473543 She never wanted this baby.
12473794 12476463 Not want a baby?<br />Why, every woman wants a baby.
12476672 12479382 You do, but she doesn't.<br />Not my children.
12479550 12481551 She told me she didn't want any more.
12481760 12485054 I wanted to hurt her because<br />she'd hurt me. And I did.
12485306 12488391 You mustn't tell me these things.<br />It's not fair to-
12488642 12491311 I didn't know about this baby<br />until she fell.
12491562 12494272 If I'd only known,<br />I'd have come straight home.
12494482 12496399 Well, of course you would.
12496650 12500069 And then when she told me<br />there on the steps, what did I do?
12500404 12502906 What did I say?<br />I laughed and I said-
12503157 12506075 But you didn't mean it.<br />I know you didn't mean it.
12506285 12509204 But I did mean it.<br />I was crazy with jealousy.
12509413 12513374 She's never cared for me. I tried<br />to make her care, but I couldn't.
12514919 12516252 You're so wrong.
12516420 12520882 Scarlett loves you a great deal.<br />Much more than she knows.
12521425 12525428 If that were true, I'd wait forever.<br />If she'd only forgive me.
12525596 12529599 She will. You must be patient.
12531060 12536189 No, it's not possible. If you<br />only knew who she really loved-
12537316 12539025 You wouldn't believe it.
12541946 12544364 Surely you haven't<br />listened to idle gossip.
12544615 12548201 No, Captain Butler.<br />I wouldn't believe it.
12549119 12553831 There, there. Scarlett's going to get well,<br />and there can be other babies.
12554708 12557377 She couldn't even if she wanted to.
12557628 12561256 But of course she could!<br />I'm going to.
12564552 12567845 No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.<br />It's too dangerous.
12568097 12571057 Children are life renewing itself,<br />Captain Butler.
12571308 12576145 And when life does that,<br />danger seems very unimportant.
12577898 12581568 I've never before known anyone<br />who was really brave.
12581819 12584737 I pray God things go well<br />with you, Miss Melly.
12584989 12589284 And I want to thank you for all<br />you've done for me and for Scarlett.
12589994 12592161 From my heart, I thank you.
12598627 12601963 Miss Scarlett's feeling<br />a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
12602172 12603673 Thank you, Mammy.
12610764 12612849 I've come to ask your forgiveness...
12613017 12615685 ...hoping our life together<br />has another chance.
12615936 12619939 Our life together? When did we<br />ever have a life together?
12621191 12622984 Yes, you're right.
12623193 12627030 But I'm sure if we could only<br />try again, we could be happy.
12627323 12629198 What is there<br />to make us happy now?
12630534 12633494 Well, there's Bonnie...
12633912 12635705 ...and I love you, Scarlett.
12636040 12637707 When did you discover that?
12637958 12642045 I've always loved you, but you've<br />never given me a chance to show it.
12643922 12646215 And just what do you want me to do?
12647301 12651220 To begin with, give up the mill,<br />Scarlett. We'll go away.
12651472 12653556 We'll take Bonnie<br />and have another honeymoon.
12653807 12656476 Give up the mill?<br />It's making more money than ever.
12656727 12659228 I know, but we don't need it.<br />Sell it.
12659730 12663232 Or give it to Ashley.<br />Melanie's been such a friend to us.
12663484 12666027 Melanie!<br />If you'd only think more about me!
12666320 12668237 I am thinking of you.
12668822 12671532 And I'm thinking that, well...
12672076 12675161 ...maybe the mill's taking you<br />away from me and Bonnie.
12675913 12678539 I know what you're thinking.<br />Don't bring Bonnie into it.
12678749 12681501 - You're taking her away from me.<br />- But she loves you.
12681752 12685421 You've made her love you and not me.<br />She's so spoiled now, that-
12685589 12688591 Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.
12688759 12690259 We're watching, darling.
12690678 12692345 You're mighty pretty, precious.
12692596 12694097 So are you.
12694348 12697266 I'm going to jump.<br />Watch me, Daddy.
12697518 12700228 I don't think you ought<br />to do much jumping yet.
12700437 12702480 You just learned<br />to ride sidesaddle.
12702940 12704190 I will so jump.
12704400 12707110 I can jump better than ever,<br />because I've grown.
12707403 12708778 I moved the bar higher.
12709029 12710571 Don't let her do it, Rhett.
12710781 12712532 No, Bonnie, you can't.
12712741 12714867 If you fall off,<br />don't cry and blame me!
12715869 12718788 Rhett, stop her.
12719415 12720456 Bonnie!
12721125 12722291 Bonnie!
12723627 12725628 She's just like Pa.
12728632 12730633 Just like Pa...!
12731468 12733469 Bonnie! Bonnie!
12741145 12742270 Bonnie!
12742980 12744313 Bonnie!
12760956 12764625 Lordy, Miss Melly.<br />I sure is glad you's come.
12764793 12769255 Oh, Mammy, this house won't seem<br />the same without Bonnie.
12769506 12771424 How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
12771675 12774761 Miss Melly, this here's<br />done broke her heart.
12775012 12777346 I didn't fetch you<br />on Miss Scarlett's account.
12777639 12782769 What that child got to stand, the good<br />Lord give her strength to stand.
12783270 12786105 It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
12789109 12791778 He done lost his mind<br />these last couple of days.
12792029 12793446 Oh, no, Mammy, no.
12793697 12798201 I ain't never seen no man, black or white,<br />set such store on any child.
12798452 12800703 When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...
12800954 12805333 ...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run<br />out and shoot that poor pony.
12805584 12808836 And for a minute,<br />I think he gonna shoot hisself.
12809087 12810630 Oh, poor Captain Butler.
12810881 12815510 Miss Scarlett called him a murderer<br />for teaching that child to jump.
12815719 12818554 She said, "You give me my baby<br />what you killed. "
12818806 12822892 And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't<br />never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
12823185 12827021 It like to turn my blood cold,<br />the things they say to one another.
12827231 12830107 Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
12832653 12834487 And then that night...
12835572 12839242 ...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br />in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.
12840369 12843746 He wouldn't open the door when<br />Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.
12844039 12846207 And that's where he's been<br />for two whole days.
12846375 12848417 Oh, Mammy!
12848752 12852421 This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted<br />through the door and said:
12852714 12854423 "The funeral's set for tomorrow. "
12854675 12857343 He says, "You try that,<br />and I kills you tomorrow.
12857719 12862723 Do you think I's gonna put my child<br />in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
12862891 12864100 Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
12864268 12867436 - He has lost his mind!<br />- Yes'm, that's the God's truth.
12867688 12871607 He ain't gonna let us bury<br />that child. You gotta help us.
12871775 12873276 Oh, but I can't intrude.
12873569 12875361 If you can't help us, who can?
12875612 12879115 Mr. Rhett always set great store<br />by your opinion.
12880868 12882869 Please, Miss Melly.
12883745 12886789 I'll do what I can, Mammy.
12892671 12894797 Get away from that door<br />and leave us alone.
12895048 12897049 It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.
12897301 12900970 Please let me in.<br />I've come to see Bonnie.
12921992 12926746 Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett<br />in this hour of his grief.
12936673 12938007 Mammy...
12938759 12941844 I want you to make a good deal<br />of strong coffee...
12942095 12945681 ...and bring it up to Captain Butler.<br />I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
12945849 12947183 But...
12947351 12951854 Captain Butler's willing for the funeral<br />to take place tomorrow morning.
12952147 12956859 Hallelujah! I expect the angels<br />fights on your side, Miss Melly.
12958153 12961447 Miss Melly! Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
12961865 12964158 Miss Melly. Miss Melly.
12965035 12969038 Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy.<br />And try...
12969289 12971290 Try to get me home.
12972376 12974335 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
12981802 12984011 Where is my mother going away to?
12984262 12987556 And why can't I go along, please?
12987766 12992144 We can't always go along, Beau,<br />as much as we may want to.
12992813 12994897 You're going back to bed now.
12995774 12999276 Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying.<br />She can't be.
12999528 13002363 She hasn't your strength.<br />She's never had any.
13002572 13006075 - She's never had anything but heart.<br />- You knew that too?
13006368 13009286 Why do I have to go back to bed?<br />It's morning.
13009913 13011580 It isn't really morning yet.
13018171 13019714 You may come in now, Scarlett.
13019923 13023676 Dr. Meade, please let me see her.<br />I've been waiting here two days.
13023927 13026929 I've got to tell her<br />that I was wrong about something.
13027180 13030725 She knows you were wrong.<br />She wants to see Scarlett.
13033854 13037106 Miss Melly's going to die in peace.<br />Don't ease your conscience...
13037357 13041569 ...telling her things that make<br />no difference now. You understand?
13055751 13057626 It's me, Melly.
13058837 13060629 Promise me?
13060922 13062423 Anything.
13063133 13065634 Look after my little son.
13066470 13070931 I gave him to you once before.<br />Remember?
13072059 13073726 The day he was born.
13073977 13077980 Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<br />I know you'll get well.
13078231 13080983 Promise me... college.
13081151 13085362 Yes, and Europe, and a pony.<br />Whatever he wants, but...
13086573 13087990 ...oh, Melly, do try.
13088241 13090159 Ashley...
13091161 13092870 Ashley and you...
13095165 13098375 What about Ashley, Melly?
13099169 13102129 Look after him for me...
13102339 13106300 ...just as you looked after me...
13107511 13108677 ...for him.
13110597 13112264 I will, Melly.
13113141 13115184 Look after him...
13115644 13119522 ...but never let him know.
13128615 13130407 Good night.
13131535 13133994 Promise?
13134204 13136288 What else, Melly?
13136540 13138707 Captain Butler.
13139709 13143212 - Be kind to him.<br />- Rhett?
13143839 13146882 He loves you so.
13149970 13151887 Yes, Melly.
13153974 13155850 Goodbye.
13156643 13157935 Goodbye.
13173869 13176078 You ladies may come in now.
13178582 13179874 Rhett...
13181459 13182751 Ashley!
13183587 13186922 I don't know where<br />the mate to this is.
13187090 13189592 She must've put it away.
13190552 13195097 Stop it! Hold me. I'm so frightened!
13196766 13199226 I'm so frightened!
13203481 13207776 Scarlett, what can I do?<br />I can't live without her. I can't!
13208862 13212990 Everything I ever had<br />is going with her.
13213533 13215117 Oh, Ashley...
13216203 13218787 You really love her, don't you?
13219039 13224126 She's the only dream I ever had<br />that didn't die in the face of reality.
13224544 13227796 Dreams. Always dreams with you.<br />Never common sense.
13228089 13231300 Scarlett, if you knew what<br />I've gone through!
13231968 13235971 Ashley, you should've told me years<br />ago that you loved her and not me.
13236223 13239266 And not left me dangling<br />with your talk of honor.
13239476 13243229 But you had to wait till now,<br />now when Melly's dying...
13243438 13246774 ...to show me that I could never<br />mean any more to you...
13247025 13249485 ...than this Watling woman<br />does to Rhett.
13251446 13256325 And I've loved something<br />that doesn't really exist.
13258536 13260120 But somehow...
13261164 13262831 ...I don't care.
13264084 13266168 Somehow, it doesn't matter.
13267921 13270339 It doesn't matter one bit.
13273051 13274343 Oh, Ashley...
13274594 13276428 Ashley, forgive me.
13276680 13280182 Don't cry. She mustn't see<br />you've been crying.
13280433 13281558 Ashley!
13284938 13286188 Melly!
13288149 13289566 Melly!
13293989 13296532 Rhett! Rhett!
13299369 13301203 Rhett, where are you?
13305166 13307209 Rhett, wait for me!
13311715 13313716 Rhett, wait for me!
13316011 13317136 Rhett!
13319139 13320472 Rhett!
13322100 13323892 Rhett!
13327897 13329064 Rhett!
13329482 13330607 Rhett!
13332360 13333736 Rhett!
13337032 13338240 Rhett!
13340493 13341618 Rhett!
13344831 13346248 Come in.
13353923 13355257 Rhett...
13355633 13358135 Melanie, she's...?
13360930 13362514 Well, God rest her.
13362932 13366268 She was the only completely<br />kind person I ever knew.
13366728 13370439 A great lady. A very great lady.
13372776 13376695 So she's dead. That makes it<br />nice for you, doesn't it?
13376946 13381700 How can you say such a thing?<br />You know how I loved her, really.
13381951 13384036 No, I don't know that I do.
13384287 13386955 It's to your credit that<br />you could appreciate her.
13387207 13391710 Of course I appreciated her.<br />She thought of everybody except herself.
13391920 13396131 - Why, her last words were about you.<br />- What did she say?
13396383 13399676 She said, "Be kind to Captain Butler...
13399928 13401929 ...he loves you so. "
13406768 13409645 Did she say anything else?<br />She said...
13410063 13413399 She asked me to look after Ashley too.
13414734 13418195 It's convenient to have<br />the first wife's permission, isn't it?
13420281 13421949 What do you mean?
13424327 13425953 What are you doing?
13426162 13427788 I'm leaving you, my dear.
13427997 13433001 All you need now is a divorce,<br />and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
13434963 13437005 Oh, no!
13437257 13439508 No, you're wrong. Terribly wrong.
13439801 13440968 I don't want a divorce.
13441219 13444263 Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight,<br />when I knew I loved you...
13444514 13447349 ...I ran home to tell you.<br />Oh, darling, darling!
13447642 13449017 Please don't go on with this.
13449269 13452938 Leave us some dignity out<br />of our marriage. Spare us this last.
13453189 13457734 This last? Do listen to me! I must<br />have loved you for years, only...
13457986 13459862 ...I was such a fool,<br />I didn't know it.
13460155 13464700 Please believe me. You must care.<br />Melly said you did.
13464951 13468120 I believe you.<br />And what about Ashley Wilkes?
13468705 13471165 I never really loved Ashley.
13471374 13474877 You certainly gave a good imitation<br />of it, up to this morning.
13476004 13478464 No, Scarlett. I've tried everything.
13478673 13481633 If you'd met me halfway, even<br />when I came back from London.
13481885 13485387 I was so glad to see you.<br />I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
13485638 13488515 Then when you were sick,<br />and it was all my fault.
13488766 13491393 I hoped that you'd call for me.<br />But you didn't.
13491686 13494646 I wanted you. I wanted you<br />desperately...
13494856 13497065 ...but I didn't think you wanted me.
13497317 13500152 It seems we've been<br />at cross purposes, doesn't it?
13500403 13502237 But it's no use now.
13502489 13505908 As long as there was Bonnie,<br />there was a chance we might be happy.
13506159 13509244 I liked to think that Bonnie<br />was you, a little girl again.
13509496 13512247 Before the war and poverty<br />had done things to you.
13512499 13514166 She was so like you.
13514375 13517586 And I could pet her and spoil her,<br />as I wanted to spoil you.
13519297 13522049 But when she went, she took everything.
13523176 13526345 Rhett, please don't say that.<br />I'm so sorry.
13526596 13529348 I'm so sorry for everything.
13530016 13532267 My darling, you're such a child.
13532519 13537439 You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"<br />all the past can be corrected.
13539234 13541610 Here, take my handkerchief.
13541861 13546240 Never, in any crisis of your life, have<br />I known you to have a handkerchief.
13550370 13552913 Rhett! Rhett, where are you going?
13553122 13555624 I'm going to Charleston,<br />back where I belong.
13555917 13558126 Please. Please take me with you.
13558336 13561213 No. I'm through<br />with everything here.
13561756 13564132 I want peace.<br />I want to see if somewhere...
13564425 13568136 ...there isn't something left<br />in life of charm and grace.
13568388 13570138 - You know what I'm talking about?<br />- No!
13570390 13574309 - I only know that I love you!<br />- That's your misfortune.
13574644 13576270 Oh, Rhett!
13580984 13582401 Rhett!
13584654 13586071 Rhett! Rhett!
13588408 13593370 Rhett! If you go, where shall I go?<br />What shall I do?
13593621 13596665 Frankly, my dear,<br />I don't give a damn.
13609929 13612973 I can't let him go. I can't!
13613266 13616310 There must be some way<br />to bring him back.
13617520 13622524 Oh, I can't think about this now.<br />I'll go crazy if I do.
13623484 13625861 I'll think about it tomorrow.
13640043 13642836 But I must think about it!
13643046 13645297 I must think about it.
13646007 13648216 What is there to do?
13649135 13651553 What is there that matters?
13654057 13658143 You mean to tell me,<br />Scarlett, Tara doesn't mean anything?
13658394 13662814 Land's the only thing that matters.<br />It's the only thing that lasts.
13663066 13666693 Something you love more than<br />me, though you may not know it. Tara.
13666944 13670364 It's this from which you get<br />your strength, the red earth of Tara.
13670573 13674242 Land's the only thing that matters.<br />The only thing that lasts.
13674535 13677579 Something you love more<br />than me, though you may not know it.
13677872 13680248 - from which you get<br />your strength. Tara.
13680458 13682376 Land's the only thing that matters.
13682543 13683752 Something you love more.
13684003 13686088 - the red earth of Tara.<br />Tara!
13686255 13687756 Tara!<br />Tara!
13690218 13691760 Tara!
13692762 13694262 Home.
13695181 13697015 I'll go home.
13697600 13700602 And I'll think of some way<br />to get him back.
13700853 13705982 After all, tomorrow is another day!
