409224 411351 What do we care if we were expelled<br />from college?
411427 414453 The war is gonna start any day.<br />We would've left college anyhow.
414530 416259 War! Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?
416332 418323 Do you know those Yankees<br />actually want a war?
418400 420595 - We'll show 'em.<br />- Fiddle-dee-dee!
420736 421930 War, war, war!
422171 425038 This war talk's spoiling all the fun<br />at every party this spring.
425107 427405 I get so bored I could scream!
427743 430940 - Besides, there isn't going to be any war.<br />- Not gonna be any war?
431013 433413 Why, honey, of course<br />there's going to be a war!
433482 437509 If either of you says "war" just once again,<br />I'll go in the house and slam the door.
437586 440680 - But, Scarlett, honey...<br />- Don't you want us to have a war?
446595 447721 Well...
448998 450226 ...but remember...
450699 451927 ...I warned you.
452267 453700 I've got an idea.
453769 456237 We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue<br />at Twelve Oaks.
456305 459035 That's a good idea.<br />Aren't you eating barbecue with us?
459108 462236 I hadn't thought about that yet.<br />I'll think about that tomorrow.
462311 463573 We want all your waltzes.
463646 466171 First Brent, then me, then Brent,<br />then me again and so on.
466281 468249 - Promise?<br />- I'd just love to.
469318 472845 If only I didn't have<br />every one of them taken already.
472921 474650 Why, honey, you can't do that to us.
474723 477385 - How about if we tell you a secret?<br />- A secret? Who about?
477459 479222 Do you know Miss Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta?
479294 481888 Ashley Wilkes' cousin.<br />She's visiting the Wilkes'...
481964 484899 That goody-goody!<br />Who wants to know a secret about her?
484967 486594 Anyway, we heard, that is, they say...
486669 490696 - Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.<br />- The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
490773 492468 Now do we get those waltzes?
492708 494039 Of course.
494943 499175 - I'll bet the other boys will be<br />hopping mad. - Let 'em be mad.<br />We two can handle 'em!
499782 502012 It can't be true. Ashley loves me!
502084 503244 Scarlett!
503652 505279 What has gotten into her?
505354 507117 Do you suppose we made her mad?
507189 511285 Where're you goin' without your shawl,<br />and the night air fixin' to set in?
511360 513920 How come you didn't ask them gentlemen<br />to stay for supper?
513996 515964 You ain't got no more manners<br />than a field hand...
516031 518158 ...after me and Miss Ellen done labored<br />with you.
518233 520724 Miss Scarlett, come on in the house!
520869 523133 Come on in before you catch<br />your death of dampness.
523205 525867 No! I'll wait for Pa to come home<br />from the Wilkes'.
525941 527533 Come on in here!
528110 529577 Come on!
544727 545989 Quittin' time!
546128 547527 Who says it's quittin' time?
547596 548756 I says it's quittin' time.
548831 552232 I's the foreman. I's the one that says<br />when it's quittin' time at Tara!
552301 553893 Quittin' time!
554336 556270 Quittin' time!
597212 600477 There's none in the county can touch you,<br />and none in the state.
601850 602874 Pa!
603185 605483 So it's proud of yourself, you are.
607689 609554 Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara!
609625 613061 So, you've been spying on me,<br />and like your sister, Suellen...
613128 615392 ...you'll tell your mother<br />I was jumping again.
615464 618797 Pa, you know I'm no tattletale like Suellen,<br />but it does seem to me...
618867 621700 ...after you broke your knee last year<br />jumping that same fence...
621770 626264 I'll not have me own daughter tellin' me<br />what I shall jump and not jump.
626341 627865 It's my own neck, so it is.
628010 631878 All right, Pa, you jump what you please.<br />How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?
631947 632971 The Wilkeses?
633048 637144 Just as you'd expect with the barbecue<br />tomorrow and talking nothing but war.
637219 639983 Oh, bother the war.<br />Was there anyone else there?
640055 643422 Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton,<br />from Atlanta and her brother, Charles.
643492 644857 Melanie Hamilton!
644927 647122 She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny.<br />I hate her.
647196 648720 Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
648797 651857 Ashley Wilkes couldn't like anyone like her.
652334 654768 What's your interest in Ashley<br />and Miss Melanie?
656038 658233 It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.
658307 661470 Has he been trifling with you?<br />Has he asked you to marry him?
661543 662976 - No!<br />- No, nor will he.
663045 666276 I have it in strictest confidence<br />from John Wilkes this afternoon...
666348 668043 ...Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.
668116 670676 It will be announced tomorrow night<br />at the ball.
671253 672743 I don't believe it.
672921 675048 Here! Here! Where are you off to?
675290 676279 Scarlett!
677226 679057 What are you about?
679494 682258 Have you made a spectacle of yourself<br />running after a man...
682331 685425 ...who's not in love with you when<br />you might have any man in the county?
685601 689037 I haven't been running after him.<br />It's just a surprise, that's all.
689104 691937 Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.
692007 695443 If Ashley wanted to marry you,<br />it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes".
695577 699069 I want my girl to be happy.<br />You'd not be happy with him.
699181 700478 I would, I would!
700616 702413 What difference does it make<br />who you marry...
702484 704975 ...so long as he's a Southerner<br />and thinks like you?
705053 707419 And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.
707489 709957 I don't want Tara.<br />Plantations don't mean anything when...
710025 714724 You mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,<br />that land doesn't mean anything to you?
714796 717424 Why, land is the only thing in the world<br />worth working for...
717499 721265 ...worth fighting for, worth dying for,<br />because it's the only thing that lasts.
721470 724997 - Oh, Pa, you talk like an Irishman.<br />- It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
725073 728634 And don't you be forgetting, Missy,<br />that you're half Irish too.
728710 731110 And to anyone with a drop of Irish blood<br />in them...
731179 733409 ...why, the land they live on<br />is like their mother.
733482 738044 Oh, but you're just a child.<br />It'll come to you, this love of the land.
738120 740486 There's no getting away from it<br />if you're Irish.
765414 766438 Yonder she comes!
766515 769313 Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,<br />your ma's home!
769384 772251 Actin' like a wet nurse<br />to them low-down, poor white trash...
772354 775846 ...instead of bein' here eatin' her supper.<br />Cookie, stir up the fire!
775924 778415 Miss Ellen's got no business<br />wearin' herself out.
778961 781429 Take the lamp out on the porch!<br />Wearin' herself out.
781496 783760 Mist' Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.
783899 785992 Wearin' herself out<br />waitin' on the poor white trash.
786068 788229 Shut up, dogs!<br />Barkin' in the house like that.
788303 790897 Get up from there. Don't you hear<br />that Miss Ellen's comin'?
790973 793305 Get out there and get her medicine chest.
793709 796007 We was gettin' worried about you,<br />Miss Ellen.
796078 798706 - Mist' Gerald...<br />- All right, Pork. I'm home.
799147 802810 Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing<br />the creek bottom today.
802884 805478 What do you want me<br />to start on tomorrow?
805554 809285 Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come<br />from Emmy Slattery's bedside.
809424 810982 Your child has been born.
811093 814324 My child, ma'am?<br />I'm sure I don't understand.
814496 816828 Has been born and, mercifully, has died.
817699 819360 Goodnight, Mr. Wilkerson.
822871 825032 I'll fix your supper for you myself,<br />and you eats it.
825107 826335 After prayers, Mammy.
826408 827534 Yes, ma'am.
828744 830075 Mr. O'Hara.
830645 832272 You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
832347 835839 Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?<br />He's the best overseer in the county.
835984 838043 He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.
838120 839212 But...
840689 841781 - No!<br />- Yes.
843191 845921 The Yankee Wilkerson<br />and the white-trash Slattery girl!
845994 847962 We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
848063 849291 Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
854936 856631 I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!
856705 859401 I don't like your tone, Suellen.<br />Your pink gown is lovely.
859474 863001 - Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?<br />- But you may wear my garnets with it.
863078 865672 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
865847 867508 Scarlett...
867582 870142 ...you look tired, my dear.<br />I'm worried about you.
871053 872384 I'm all right, Mother.
872487 874921 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
874990 876355 I'm 13 now.
876458 878756 You may go to the barbecue<br />and stay up through supper.
878827 881057 I didn't want to wear<br />your tacky green dress anyhow, stingy!
881129 882061 Oh, hush up!
882130 883620 Prayers, girls.
890372 895400 "And to all the saints, that I have sinned<br />exceedingly in thought, word and deed...
895644 896941 "...through my fault.
897145 900308 "Through my fault,<br />through my most grievous fault.
900782 904115 "Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary,<br />ever Virgin...
904252 906516 "...Blessed Michael, the Archangel...
906688 908588 "...Blessed John the Baptist...
908657 910921 "...the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...
911593 914585 "...and all the saints<br />to pray to the Lord, our God, for me."
914696 916755 But Ashley doesn't know I love him!
917966 921629 I'll tell him that I love him<br />and then he can't marry her!
922804 925932 "May the Almighty,<br />and most merciful Lord...
926007 927941 "...grant us pardon, absolution...
928410 930139 "...and remission of our sins. Amen."
932714 934978 Just hold on and suck in.
936051 938315 Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.
938553 940987 You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.
941056 942648 Oh, yes, ma'am, you is!
942824 945088 You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.
946094 948119 No, I'm not!
950866 952925 Put on the dress,<br />because we're late already.
953001 954901 - What's my lamb gonna wear?<br />- That.
954970 958997 No you ain't! You can't show your bosom<br />before three o'clock.
959207 961038 I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!
961109 964476 If you say one word to Mother,<br />I won't eat a bite!
968617 969641 Well...
976224 979523 Keep your shawl on.<br />I ain't aimin' for you to get all freckled...
979594 983724 ...after the buttermilk I done put on you<br />all this winter, bleachin' them freckles.
990005 993941 Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on<br />and be good, and eat just a little, honey.
994009 995067 No.
995377 999177 I'm going to have a good time today<br />and do my eating at the barbecue.
999414 1002178 If you don't care what folks says<br />about this family, I does!
1002250 1005515 I has told you and told you<br />that you can always tell a lady...
1005587 1007782 ...by the way she eats with folks.<br />Like a bird!
1007856 1009915 I ain't aimin' for you to go after<br />Mr. Wilkes...
1009991 1012186 ...and eat like a field hand<br />and gobble like a hog!
1012260 1013591 Fiddle-dee-dee!
1014029 1017396 Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl<br />with a healthy appetite.
1017532 1020399 What gentlemen says and what they thinks<br />is two different things.
1020468 1024234 And I ain't noticed Mist' Ashley<br />askin' to marry you!
1039621 1043557 Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need<br />of havin' it come right back up again.
1046094 1049029 Why does a girl have to be so silly<br />to catch a husband?
1049264 1054327 <i>Scarlett, if you're not here by the time</i><br /><i>I count ten, we'll be goin' without you!</i>
1054502 1055560 I'm coming, Pa!
1055737 1056795 <i>One...</i>
1056871 1058498 <i>...two, three...</i>
1059207 1061266 <i>...four, five, six...</i>
1062310 1063436 Oh, dear!
1063678 1067409 My stays are so tight I know I'll never get<br />through the day without belching.
1092274 1096040 Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day<br />you'll be having for the barbecue.
1096244 1099213 So it seems, Gerald.<br />But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
1099281 1101340 She's after settling accounts<br />with the overseer.
1101416 1103111 But she'll be along for the ball tonight.
1103184 1105015 Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
1105086 1107111 Thank you kindly, India.
1107188 1109884 Your daughter's getting prettier every day,<br />John.
1110425 1113417 India, here are the O'Hara girls.<br />We must greet them.
1113495 1116692 I can't stand Scarlett. If you saw<br />the way she throws herself at Ashley.
1116798 1118823 Now, that's your brother's business.
1118900 1121528 You must remember your duties<br />as hostess.
1121603 1122865 Good morning, girls.
1124406 1126033 Good morning, Scarlett.
1126741 1129232 Why, India Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
1129311 1132542 - Perfectly lovely, darling.<br />- I just can't take my eyes off it.
1134482 1135540 Scarlett, honey...
1135617 1137608 You're looking mighty fine this morning.
1137686 1139984 - Good morning, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good morning.
1140588 1142613 - It's a pleasure to see you.<br />- Good morning.
1142691 1143919 Howdy, Miss Scarlett.
1145560 1146584 Ashley!
1148997 1150555 Scarlett, my dear.
1152067 1154194 I've been looking for you everywhere.
1154269 1156237 I've got something I must tell you.
1156404 1159896 - Can't we go some place where it's quiet?<br />- Yes, I'd like to, but I...
1160108 1162099 ...I have something to tell you too.
1162177 1164941 Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
1165814 1168214 But come say hello<br />to my cousin, Melanie, first.
1168283 1169875 Oh, do we have to?
1170185 1173018 She's been looking forward<br />to seeing you again.
1173188 1174212 Melanie!
1175357 1176881 Here's Scarlett.
1177359 1178326 Scarlett!
1179894 1181521 I'm so glad to see you again.
1181696 1184688 Melanie Hamilton!<br />What a surprise to run into you here.
1184866 1186993 I hope you'll stay with us<br />a few days at least.
1187068 1190595 I hope I shall stay long enough for us<br />to become real friends, Scarlett.
1190739 1192206 I do so want us to be.
1192273 1194173 We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?
1194242 1196710 We'll just have to make the biggest fuss<br />over her, won't we?
1196778 1199747 If there's anybody knows how to give a girl<br />a good time, it's Ashley.
1199814 1203045 Though I expect our good times will seem<br />silly to you because you're so serious.
1203118 1205814 Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
1206121 1207611 I've always admired you so.
1207689 1209316 I wish I could be more like you.
1209391 1212326 You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,<br />and say things you don't mean.
1212394 1215852 Nobody could accuse Melanie<br />of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
1216398 1218457 Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?
1218533 1220933 Ashley never means a word he says<br />to any girl.
1221503 1224995 Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,<br />you handsome old thing, you!
1225073 1226665 But, oh, Miss O'Hara, I...
1226741 1229005 Was it kind to bring<br />your good-looking brother here...
1229077 1231545 ...just to break my poor, simple,<br />country-girl's heart?
1231813 1233838 She never even noticed Charles before.
1233915 1236179 Because he's your beau,<br />she's after him like a hornet.
1236251 1238811 Charles Hamilton,<br />I want to eat barbecue with you.
1238887 1242584 Mind you, don't go philandering with<br />any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.
1242657 1244056 I won't, Miss O'Hara!
1244526 1245788 I couldn't!
1246294 1248990 I do declare, Frank Kennedy,<br />if you don't look dashing...
1249063 1250394 ...with that new set of whiskers!
1250465 1252956 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
1253401 1256165 Charles and Rafe asked me<br />to eat barbecue with them...
1256271 1258466 ...but I told them I couldn't<br />because I promised you.
1258540 1262135 You needn't be so amused. Look at her!<br />She's after your beau now!
1262544 1265342 Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1265880 1267871 I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.
1268183 1270777 What's your sister so mad about?<br />You sparkin' her beau?
1270919 1273979 As if I couldn't get a better beau<br />than that old maid in britches.
1274055 1277388 Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome<br />old things, you! No, you're not!
1277459 1278983 I won't say that. I'm mad at you!
1279060 1280084 What have we done?
1280161 1282356 You haven't been near me all day.<br />I wore this old dress...
1282430 1283795 ...'cause I thought you liked it.
1283865 1285833 I was counting on eating barbecue<br />with you two.
1285900 1288164 - Well, you are, Scarlett.<br />- Of course, you are.
1288336 1292272 Oh, I never can make up my mind<br />which of you two is the handsomer.
1292607 1295770 I was awake all last night trying<br />to figure it out.
1301349 1303078 Cathleen, who's that?
1303218 1304185 Who?
1304252 1306277 That man looking at us and smiling.
1306654 1307848 The nasty, dark one.
1307956 1311983 My dear, don't you know?<br />That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.
1312060 1314187 He has the most terrible reputation.
1319033 1322264 He looks as if, as if he knows<br />what I look like without my shimmy!
1322337 1323395 Scarlett!
1323771 1325568 Why, my dear, he isn't received!
1325940 1327498 He spends a lot of time up North...
1327575 1330100 ...because his folks in Charleston<br />won't even speak to him.
1330178 1332510 He was expelled from West Point,<br />he's so fast.
1332580 1335845 And then there's that business<br />about that girl he wouldn't marry.
1335917 1336941 Tell, tell!
1337118 1341350 Well, he took her out buggy riding<br />in the late afternoon without a chaperon!
1341923 1344414 And then he refused to marry her!
1348029 1350623 No, but she was ruined just the same.
1356371 1357895 Ashley!
1358072 1359164 Happy?
1359274 1360263 So happy!
1362010 1364137 You seem to belong here...
1364579 1367013 ...as if it had all been imagined for you.
1368416 1370816 I like to feel that I belong<br />to the things you love.
1370885 1372477 You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
1372554 1373612 Yes, Ashley.
1374022 1375512 I love it as...
1375590 1377114 ...as more than a house.
1377759 1381752 It's a whole world that wants only<br />to be graceful and beautiful.
1381896 1384057 It's so unaware that it may not last...
1384799 1385891 ...forever.
1385967 1389232 You're afraid of what may happen<br />if the war comes, aren't you?
1389370 1391964 But we don't have to be afraid for us.
1392540 1395008 No war can come into our world, Ashley.
1396010 1397307 Whatever comes...
1398012 1400742 ...I'll love you, just as I do now...
1401516 1402642 ...until I die.
1407755 1409484 Isn't this better than sitting at a table?
1409557 1412025 A girl hasn't got but two sides to her<br />at a table.
1413428 1414520 I'll go get her dessert.
1414596 1416996 - Here, she said me.<br />- Allow me, Miss O'Hara.
1419233 1420427 I think...
1423738 1426536 I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
1428142 1429803 Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!
1430345 1431573 Thank you.
1431813 1432939 Go get it.
1433114 1435241 Isn't he the luckiest...?
1442557 1443581 Miss O'Hara...
1445126 1446115 ...I love you.
1447729 1450129 I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
1453534 1456332 Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.
1456604 1458936 Well-brought-up young ladies<br />take naps at parties.
1459007 1462943 And it's high time you started behavin' and<br />actin' like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
1463011 1466447 When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice<br />any Yankee girls taking naps.
1466514 1470382 No, and you ain't gonna see<br />no Yankee girls at the ball tonight neither.
1470551 1472143 How was Ashley today, Scarlett?
1472220 1474814 He didn't seem to be paying<br />much attention to you.
1474956 1476685 You mind your own business!
1476924 1479119 You'll be lucky not to lose<br />ol' whisker-face Kennedy.
1479193 1480490 You've liked Ashley for months!
1480561 1482995 His engagement's gonna be announced<br />tonight. Pa said so this morning.
1483064 1484224 That's all you know.
1485299 1488063 Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!<br />You all behave yourselves.
1488236 1489863 Actin' like poor, white-trash children!
1489937 1492906 If you's old enough to go to parties,<br />you's old enough to act like ladies.
1492974 1494100 Who cares!
1545460 1547985 <i>We've borne enough insults</i><br /><i>from the meddling Yankees.</i>
1548062 1550826 <i>It's time we made them understand</i><br /><i>we'll keep our slaves...</i>
1550898 1552331 <i>...with or without their approval.</i>
1552400 1555198 <i>'Twas the sovereign right of the</i><br /><i>state of Georgia to secede from the Union!</i>
1555269 1556201 <i>That's right!</i>
1556270 1558864 <i>The South must assert herself</i><br /><i>by force of arms.</i>
1559307 1563471 <i>After we've fired on the Yankee rascals</i><br /><i>at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!</i>
1563644 1566010 - <i>There's no other way!</i><br />- <i>Fight! That's right. Fight!</i>
1566080 1567809 <i>Let the Yankees ask for peace!</i>
1567882 1571511 The situation is very simple.<br />The Yankees can't fight and we can.
1572553 1573986 There won't even be a battle.
1574055 1575682 They'll just turn and run every time.
1575757 1577554 One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.
1577625 1579559 We'll finish them in one battle.
1579627 1581561 Gentlemen can always fight better<br />than rabble.
1581629 1583961 Yes, gentlemen always can fight better<br />than rabble.
1584098 1586259 What does the captain of our troop say?
1586434 1589870 Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights<br />I go with her.
1590805 1594138 But, like my father, I hope that the Yankees<br />will let us leave the Union in peace.
1594208 1595835 - But, Ashley...<br />- But, Ashley, they've insulted us!
1595910 1597810 You can't mean you don't want war!
1597879 1601315 Most of the miseries of the world<br />were caused by wars.
1601449 1605442 And when the wars were over<br />no one ever knew what they were about.
1605520 1606987 If it wasn't that I knew you...
1607054 1611081 Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been<br />up North, I hear.
1611225 1613284 Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?
1613828 1616388 I think it's hard winning a war with words,<br />gentlemen.
1616464 1617863 What do you mean, sir?
1617999 1620832 There's not a cannon factory<br />in the whole South.
1620902 1622836 What difference does that make<br />to a gentleman?
1622904 1626135 It'll make a great deal of difference<br />to a great many gentlemen, sir.
1626207 1629040 Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,<br />that the Yankees can lick us?
1629110 1630304 No, I'm not hinting.
1630378 1633438 I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees<br />are better equipped than we.
1633514 1635812 They've got factories, shipyards,<br />coal mines...
1635883 1638716 ...and a fleet to bottle up our harbors<br />and starve us to death.
1638786 1642119 All we've got is cotton and slaves<br />and arrogance.
1642323 1645850 - That's Yankee treachery!<br />- Sir, I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
1645960 1647484 I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
1647562 1649860 Apologies aren't enough, sir!
1650031 1652829 I hear you were turned out of West Point,<br />Mr. Rhett Butler...
1652900 1657132 ...and you aren't received by any decent<br />family in Charleston, not even your own!
1661576 1664545 I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
1666347 1669077 Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about<br />and look over your place.
1669150 1672449 I seem to be spoiling everybody's brandy<br />and cigars and...
1672987 1674352 ...dreams of victory.
1681329 1684856 <i>That's just about what you could expect</i><br /><i>from somebody like Rhett Butler.</i>
1684932 1686729 <i>You did everything but call him out.</i>
1686801 1687961 He refused to fight.
1688035 1690936 Not quite that, Charles.<br />He refused to take advantage of you.
1691005 1691972 Take advantage of me?
1692106 1693630 He's one of the best shots in the country...
1693708 1695232 ...as he's proved a number of times...
1695309 1697243 ...against steadier hands and cooler heads<br />than yours.
1697311 1698608 - I'll show him!<br />- Now, please.
1698679 1701204 Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
1701282 1704115 You may be needed<br />for more important fighting, Charles.
1704418 1706852 Now, if you'll excuse me,<br />Mr. Butler is our guest.
1706921 1709014 I think I'll just show him around.
1721769 1722861 Ashley!
1730444 1732002 Ashley!
1732580 1733638 Scarlett.
1735483 1737678 Who're you hiding from in here?
1742823 1744518 What are you up to?
1746560 1749586 Well, why aren't you upstairs resting<br />with the other girls?
1750898 1752923 What is this, Scarlett? A secret?
1753334 1755700 Oh, Ashley, Ashley...
1756370 1757530 ...I love you.
1757905 1758929 Scarlett!
1759006 1760473 I love you, I do!
1762810 1766473 Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered<br />every other man's heart today?
1766547 1768947 You've always had mine.<br />You cut your teeth on it.
1769016 1770643 Oh, don't tease me now.
1770718 1773516 Have I your heart, my darling?<br />I love you, I love you.
1773587 1777216 You mustn't say such things.<br />You'll hate me for hearing them.
1777325 1781489 Oh, I could never hate you,<br />and I know you must care about me.
1781896 1784023 Oh, you do care, don't you?
1785266 1786392 Yes...
1786968 1788094 ...I care.
1789537 1792404 Oh, can't we go away and forget<br />we ever said these things?
1794241 1795902 But how can we do that?
1796243 1798473 Don't you want to marry me?
1798612 1800136 I'm going to marry Melanie.
1800381 1802747 But you can't. Not if you care for me.
1802817 1805945 Oh, my dear, why must you make me<br />say things that will hurt you?
1806854 1808913 How can I make you understand?
1809724 1811316 You're so young and unthinking.
1811392 1812723 You don't know what marriage means.
1812793 1815227 I know I love you,<br />and I want to be your wife.
1815396 1816829 You don't love Melanie.
1816964 1818431 She's like me, Scarlett.
1818833 1821563 She's part of my blood<br />and we understand each other.
1821869 1823734 But you love me.
1823971 1825598 How could I help loving you?
1826107 1828632 You have all the passion<br />for life that I lack.
1828809 1831277 That kind of love isn't enough<br />for a successful marriage...
1831345 1833006 ...for two people as different as we are.
1833080 1836311 Well, why don't you say it, you coward?<br />You're afraid to marry me.
1836550 1838575 You'd rather live with that fool<br />who can't speak except...
1838652 1842452 ...to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel<br />of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.
1842523 1844013 You mustn't say such things<br />about Melanie.
1844091 1845820 Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
1845893 1848691 You led me on, you made me believe<br />you wanted to marry me.
1848763 1851095 Now, Scarlett, be fair.<br />I never, at any time...
1851165 1854692 You did, it's true you did!<br />I'll hate you till I die!
1855302 1858601 I can't think of anything bad enough<br />to call you.
1885599 1887464 Has the war started?
1888069 1891470 Sir, you should have made<br />your presence known.
1891772 1893933 In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
1894141 1896336 That wouldn't have been very tactful,<br />would it?
1896410 1898970 But don't worry,<br />your secret is safe with me.
1899580 1900672 Sir, you are no gentleman!
1900748 1902875 And you, Miss, are no lady.
1903350 1905181 Don't think I hold that against you.
1905252 1906981 Ladies have never held any charm for me.
1907054 1910080 First you take a low, common advantage<br />of me, then you insult me.
1910157 1913593 I meant it as a compliment<br />and I hope to see more of you...
1913661 1916494 ...when you're free of the spell<br />of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.
1916564 1920830 He doesn't strike me as half good enough<br />for a girl of your, what was it?
1921068 1922535 Your "passion for living."
1922736 1925364 How dare you!<br />You aren't fit to wipe his boots.
1926907 1929899 And you were going to hate him<br />for the rest of your life.
1932246 1936239 <i>She certainly made a fool of herself</i><br /><i>running after all the men at the barbecue.</i>
1936317 1937978 <i>That's not fair, India.</i>
1938052 1940816 <i>She's so attractive,</i><br /><i>the men just naturally flock to her.</i>
1940921 1943185 Oh, Melanie, you're just too good<br />to be true.
1943257 1945122 Didn't you see her going after<br />your brother, Charles?
1945192 1947285 Yes, and she knows Charles belongs to me.
1947361 1948988 Oh, you're wrong, India.
1949063 1952123 Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
1952299 1955166 <i>Men may flirt with girls like that</i><br /><i>but they don't marry them.</i>
1955236 1957431 <i>I think you're being very mean to her.</i>
1966080 1969049 War! War's declared! War!
1980728 1982127 Miss O'Hara!
1985232 1986392 Miss O'Hara!
1986600 1989899 Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,<br />volunteers to fight against us.
1989970 1992564 Don't you men ever think<br />of anything important?
1992640 1995006 But it's war and everybody's going off<br />to enlist.
1995109 1996633 They're going right away. I'm going too.
1996710 1997768 Everybody?
2002082 2004482 Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
2004885 2006512 To see us go, I mean.
2007021 2008955 I'll cry into my pillow every night.
2009089 2011080 Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
2011258 2015661 You're the most beautiful girl in the world,<br />and the sweetest and the dearest.
2015796 2018094 I know I couldn't hope<br />that you could love me.
2018165 2021623 I'm so clumsy and stupid<br />and not nearly good enough for you.
2021702 2025570 But if you could think of marrying me<br />I'd do anything in the world for you.
2025739 2027263 Just anything. I promise.
2027808 2029070 What did you say?
2029176 2032009 Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?
2037785 2039753 Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
2040354 2042618 You will? You'll marry me.<br />You'll wait for me?
2043057 2044319 I don't think I'd want to wait.
2044391 2046825 You mean you'll marry me before I go?
2047328 2049296 Oh, Miss O'Hara.
2049363 2051092 Scarlett...
2052766 2054256 When may I speak to your father?
2054335 2055393 The sooner the better.
2055469 2057027 I'll go now. I can't wait.
2057104 2059004 Will you excuse me, dear?
2063944 2065809 Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.
2065879 2067744 It'll be a week at least<br />before they call on me.
2067815 2070943 Only a week, and then they'll take you<br />away from me.
2104184 2106812 Scarlett, I thought of you<br />at our wedding yesterday...
2106887 2109981 ...and I hoped that yours would be<br />as beautiful, and it was.
2110624 2111648 Was it?
2112059 2114493 Now we're really and truly sisters.
2115162 2116652 - Charles.<br />- Melanie.
2124571 2127699 Don't cry, darling,<br />the war will be over in a few weeks...
2127775 2129902 ...and I'll be coming back to you.
2174021 2175386 Miss Scarlett!
2176056 2179219 Well, I don't care.<br />I'm too young to be a widow.
2179426 2180723 Miss Scarlett!
2182563 2185191 Why, I just go around scaring people<br />in that thing.
2186266 2188791 You ain't supposed to be around people.<br />You's in mournin'.
2188869 2191167 For what? I don't feel anything.
2191839 2194501 Why should I have to pretend<br />and pretend...
2195175 2196642 What is it?
2197378 2199471 Oh, baby...
2200814 2201803 What is it?
2202149 2203673 My life is over.
2204084 2206644 Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.
2208989 2210354 Oh, Mother.
2210424 2214588 I know you'll think I'm horrible,<br />but I just can't bear going around in black.
2215129 2217757 It's bad enough not being able<br />to go to any parties...
2217931 2219421 ...but looking this way too.
2219500 2221434 I don't think you're at all horrible.
2221568 2225402 It's only natural to want to look young<br />and be young when you are young.
2225973 2227702 Oh, baby...
2228675 2230643 How would you like<br />to go visiting somewhere?
2230711 2231871 Savannah perhaps?
2231945 2234004 What would I do in Savannah?
2234248 2236011 Well, Atlanta then.
2236083 2238278 There's lots going on there.
2238352 2241321 And you could stay<br />with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
2242256 2243416 Melanie.
2243857 2244983 Yes.
2245726 2246954 Yes, I could, couldn't I?
2247027 2250155 Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,<br />sweeter than anybody in the world.
2250230 2251595 You'd like it, really?
2252132 2255397 All right then.<br />Now stop your crying and smile.
2257204 2258865 You can take Prissy with you.
2259540 2261735 Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,<br />Mammy.
2262142 2264042 I'll go write the necessary letters.
2267181 2268170 Atlanta!
2268482 2271849 Savannah would be better for you.<br />You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.
2271919 2273386 What trouble are you talking about?
2273454 2276890 You know what trouble I's talkin' about.<br />I's talkin' about Mist' Ashley Wilkes.
2276957 2278822 He'll be comin' to Atlanta<br />when he gets his leave...
2278892 2281486 ...and you're sittin' there waitin'<br />for him just like a spider!
2281562 2285054 - He belongs to Miss Melanie...<br />- You go pack my things like Mother said.
2306086 2308884 They're all whispering,<br />and I just know it's about her.
2309022 2310853 What's it matter what they say,<br />Aunt Pittypat?
2310924 2315554 But Scarlett is living under my roof<br />so they all think I'm responsible for her...
2315729 2319460 ...and for a widow to appear in public<br />at a social gathering!
2319633 2322261 Every time I think of it I feel faint!
2322336 2326568 Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here<br />only to help raise money for the cause.
2326640 2329700 It was splendid of her<br />to make the sacrifice.
2329843 2331572 Anyone would think, to hear you talk...
2331645 2335137 ...that she came here to dance<br />instead of to sell things.
2347494 2349223 Ladies and gentlemen!
2349296 2351992 I have important news! Glorious news!
2352366 2355460 Another triumph<br />for our magnificent men in arms.
2356203 2359331 General Lee has completely<br />whipped the enemy.
2359506 2363499 And swept the Yankee Army<br />northward from Virginia.
2372619 2375747 And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
2376223 2380353 We have with us tonight that most daring<br />of all blockade-runners...
2380727 2384128 ...whose fleet schooners,<br />slipping past the Yankee guns...
2384364 2388198 ...have brought us here the very woolens<br />and laces we wear tonight.
2388402 2392463 I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that<br />will-o'-the-wisp of the bounding main.
2392673 2395471 None other than our friend<br />from Charleston...
2395776 2397334 ...Captain Rhett Butler!
2418298 2419697 Permit me.
2424004 2427201 Captain Butler, it's such a pleasure<br />to see you again.
2427507 2429532 I met you last at my husband's home.
2429643 2431873 That's kind of you to remember,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2432279 2434907 Did you meet Captain Butler<br />at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
2434982 2437075 Yes. I, I think so.
2437351 2439979 Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />It was in the library.
2440053 2441953 You had broken something.
2443056 2445490 Yes, Captain Butler, I remember you.
2445559 2449359 Ladies, the Confederacy asks for<br />your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.
2449663 2451722 We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.
2451798 2453060 Wait.
2453667 2456033 On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br />and Mrs. Hamilton.
2457070 2458401 Thank you, Captain Butler.
2458705 2460332 Just a moment, please.
2463410 2465435 But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
2465579 2468878 It may help my husband more,<br />off my finger.
2469516 2470642 Thank you.
2473120 2475680 That's a very beautiful thing to do,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2476189 2477247 Here.
2477524 2480084 You can have mine, too, for the cause.
2482362 2486230 And you, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />I know just how much that means to you.
2486533 2487898 - Melanie!<br />- Yes, Dr. Meade.
2487968 2490300 I need your approval,<br />as a member of the Committee...
2490370 2492895 ...for something we want to do<br />that's rather shocking.
2493607 2495598 Will you excuse us, please?
2497444 2501107 I'll say one thing, the war makes<br />the most peculiar widows.
2501381 2502541 I wish you'd go away.
2502616 2505813 If you had any raising you'd know<br />I never want to see you again.
2508689 2510156 Now, why be silly?
2510223 2514387 You've no reason for hating me.<br />I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
2516096 2519827 I guess I'd be very unpatriotic<br />to hate one of the great heroes of the war.
2519900 2523529 I do declare I was surprised to see<br />you turn out to be such a noble character.
2523603 2527095 I can't bear to take advantage<br />of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.
2527174 2529233 I'm neither noble nor heroic.
2529543 2530771 But you are a blockade-runner.
2530844 2532903 For profit, and profit only.
2533380 2535348 Are you telling me<br />you don't believe in the cause?
2535415 2537849 I believe in Rhett Butler.<br />He's the only cause I know.
2538118 2539983 The rest doesn't mean much to me.
2543056 2545024 And now, ladies and gentlemen...
2545125 2548094 ...I have a startling surprise<br />for the benefit of the hospital.
2549863 2553993 Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening<br />reel with the lady of your choice...
2554301 2556030 ...you must bid for her.
2557537 2560597 Caroline Meade, how can you permit<br />your husband to conduct this...
2560674 2562301 ...this slave auction?
2562375 2564935 Dolly Merriwether,<br />how dare you criticize me!
2565312 2566939 Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...
2567047 2569845 ...that if it's for the benefit of the cause,<br />it's quite all right.
2569916 2571178 She did!
2571251 2574277 Oh dear, oh dear.<br />Where are my smelling salts?
2574654 2575814 I think I shall faint.
2575956 2578288 Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.
2578492 2581086 If Melanie says it's all right,<br />it is all right.
2582329 2585127 Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?<br />Make your offers.
2586066 2587727 Don't be bashful, gentlemen.
2588535 2592437 Twenty dollars,<br />$20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.
2592572 2594767 Twenty-five dollars for Miss Fanny Elsing.
2594841 2596968 Only $25 to give your...
2597110 2599169 One hundred and fifty dollars in gold.
2599713 2600907 For what lady, sir?
2601014 2602982 For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2605886 2606978 For whom, sir?
2607354 2608912 Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2609122 2611283 Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,<br />Captain Butler...
2611391 2614155 ...but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles<br />would be proud to...
2614227 2617685 Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2618498 2620693 She will not consider it, sir.
2620934 2622265 Oh yes, I will.
2634514 2637745 Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.
2638819 2640844 We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.
2640921 2642684 It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?
2642923 2643947 It's worse.
2644090 2646081 But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
2646159 2647922 I don't care what you expect<br />or what they think.
2647994 2649484 I'm going to dance and dance.
2649563 2652589 Tonight I wouldn't mind dancing<br />with Abe Lincoln himself.
2684431 2687025 Another dance and my reputation<br />will be lost forever.
2687100 2689295 With enough courage,<br />you can do without a reputation.
2689369 2691394 Oh, you do talk scandalous.
2699446 2701710 You do waltz divinely, Captain Butler.
2701948 2705748 Don't start flirting with me.<br />I'm not one of your plantation beaux.
2705886 2708116 I want more than flirting from you.
2708655 2709952 What do you want?
2710724 2715093 I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara,<br />if you'll take that Southern<br />belle simper off your face.
2715962 2717486 Some day I want you to say to me...
2717564 2720397 ...the words I heard you say<br />to Ashley Wilkes:
2720767 2721927 "I love you."
2722469 2726701 That's something you'll never hear from<br />me, Captain Butler, as long as you live.
2746660 2748992 <i>How sweet, how kind.</i>
2749562 2751530 <i>He is a thoughtful gentleman.</i>
2751598 2755329 <i>Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say</i><br /><i>something about my sacrifice?</i>
2763243 2765336 Oh, the darling thing.
2765412 2767346 Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.
2767514 2770608 You didn't really bring it all the way<br />from Paris just for me.
2770684 2774142 Yes, I thought it was about time<br />I got you out of that fake mourning.
2774854 2777584 Next trip I'll bring you some green silk<br />for a frock to match it.
2777657 2778681 Oh, Rhett.
2778825 2784092 It's my duty to our brave boys at the front<br />to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
2784664 2787758 Oh, it's so long<br />since I've had anything new.
2797944 2799275 How do I look?
2800213 2801840 Awful! Just awful.
2802515 2803777 Why, what's the matter?
2803850 2805078 This war has stopped being a joke...
2805151 2808416 ...when a girl like you doesn't know how<br />to wear the latest fashion.
2813760 2816251 Oh, Rhett, let me do it.
2821668 2824728 But, Rhett, I don't know how I dare wear it.
2825638 2827037 You will though.
2827607 2830098 And another thing, those pantalettes.
2830276 2833040 I don't know a woman in Paris<br />that wears pantalettes anymore.
2833113 2834375 Oh, what do they...?
2834781 2836908 You shouldn't talk about such things.
2836983 2837950 You little hypocrite.
2838051 2840713 You don't mind my knowing about them,<br />just my talking.
2840787 2844484 But, I really can't go on accepting gifts<br />from you, though you are awfully kind.
2844557 2846525 I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.
2846659 2850425 I never give anything without expecting<br />something in return. I always get paid.
2850497 2852897 If you think I'll marry you to pay<br />for the bonnet, I won't.
2852966 2855560 Don't flatter yourself.<br />I'm not a marrying man.
2856302 2858998 Well, I won't kiss you for it either.
2869282 2871045 Open your eyes and look at me.
2872485 2874419 No, I don't think I will kiss you...
2874487 2876182 ...although you need kissing badly.
2876256 2877587 That's what's wrong with you.
2877657 2880592 You should be kissed and often.<br />And by someone who knows how.
2880660 2883322 Oh, and I suppose you think<br />you're the proper person.
2883396 2886194 I might be, if the right moment ever came.
2886699 2889395 You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,<br />Rhett Butler.
2889469 2892199 And I don't know why<br />I let you come and see me.
2892539 2894166 I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
2894240 2896435 Because I'm the only man over 16<br />and under 60...
2896509 2898807 ...who's around to show you a good time.
2898878 2901438 But cheer up,<br />the war can't last much longer.
2901581 2903310 Oh really, Rhett? Why?
2903383 2906477 There's a battle going on right now<br />that ought to pretty well fix things...
2906553 2907520 ...one way or the other.
2907620 2909713 Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
2911424 2914723 You still haven't gotten the wooden-headed<br />Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
2914794 2916125 Yes, I suppose he's in it.
2916196 2918187 Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?
2918498 2921661 Some little town in Pennsylvania<br />called Gettysburg.
3003116 3004208 Here you is, Miss Melanie.
3004284 3006980 They was fightin' for them<br />so it just got tore in half.
3007253 3010051 Scarlett, you look. The W's at the end.
3013960 3017327 Wellman, Wendell, White,<br />Whitner, Wilkins...
3017997 3019191 ...Williams, Woolsey, Workman.
3019265 3021529 Scarlett, you've passed him.
3022135 3023966 Oh, he isn't there!
3024037 3025004 He isn't there!
3025071 3027301 Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.
3027373 3029534 Oh, he's safe, he's safe.
3031377 3035370 Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet<br />to worry about Ashley like this for me.
3042822 3044255 I must go to her.
3045858 3047689 Don't, my dear, not here.
3048661 3049923 Let's go home.
3051297 3052992 Dr. Meade, not...
3053066 3055728 Yes, our boy, Darcy.
3056502 3059198 I was making these mittens for him.
3059806 3061637 He won't need them now.
3062675 3066543 Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show 'em.<br />I'll kill all those Yankees.
3066646 3068045 Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.
3068114 3070344 Do you think it will help your mother<br />to have you off getting shot too?
3070416 3072247 I never heard of anything so silly.
3074988 3078116 It's a black day, Scarlett.<br />You haven't had bad news, have you?
3078258 3079452 Ashley's safe.
3079692 3081387 I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
3081461 3082951 But, Rhett, there are so many others.
3083029 3083927 Many of your friends?
3083997 3087728 Just about every family in the county.<br />The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.
3087800 3091497 Yes, look at them.<br />All these poor tragic people.
3092372 3095899 The South's sinking to its knees.<br />It'll never rise again.
3096676 3098007 The cause...
3098311 3101439 The cause of living in the past is dying<br />right in front of us.
3101614 3103582 I never heard you talk like that before.
3103650 3107814 I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.<br />And that's what all this is, sheer waste.
3110023 3111547 But don't you be downcast.
3111858 3115294 Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home<br />to the women who love him...
3115628 3117027 ...both of them.
3153766 3155290 Oh, you're here.
3158705 3161674 Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.
3161974 3164169 Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.
3164377 3166777 Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.
3170717 3172776 Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.
3174287 3175584 Scarlett, dear.
3178024 3181790 Well, is this any way to greet<br />a returning warrior?
3182128 3183652 Ashley, I...
3186966 3188661 Merry Christmas, Ashley.
3197276 3201076 Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br />We've got all your wives.
3201647 3203581 We've got all your little chicks.
3203750 3206878 You got nobody to worry your head<br />about leavin'.
3207420 3208478 Come on.
3208755 3213158 Now you just stand still so you can be<br />a Christmas gift for the white folks.
3213226 3214557 Now hold on.
3215294 3216283 Hold on!
3216996 3219055 Don't go gettin' so uppity...
3219232 3221632 ...even if you is the<br />last chicken in Atlanta.
3224103 3226435 Let's not talk about the war.<br />It's Christmas.
3226506 3230203 Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara<br />and all the times before the war.
3230276 3231766 Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?
3231844 3234278 Why did you say there wasn't enough,<br />Uncle Peter?
3234347 3237874 There's plenty. It's the very last<br />of my father's fine Madeira.
3238084 3241986 He got it from his uncle,<br />Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
3242221 3245622 ...who married his cousin,<br />Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...
3245858 3249259 ...who was his second cousin once removed<br />and a kin to the Wilkeses too.
3249529 3252930 I saved it to wish Ashley<br />a Merry Christmas.
3253599 3257296 But you mustn't drink it all at once<br />because it is the last.
3262141 3264905 I meant it, my dear.<br />It was a lovely Christmas gift.
3265178 3267442 Only generals have tunics like this,<br />nowadays.
3267613 3269376 I'm so happy you like it, dear.
3269449 3271110 Where did you get the cloth?
3271317 3273444 It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.
3273586 3277317 I nursed her son while he was in<br />the hospital, Ashley, before he died and...
3278057 3280685 Oh, you will take good care of it,<br />won't you?
3280993 3283086 You won't let it get torn.
3283529 3284496 Promise me.
3284597 3285757 You mustn't worry.
3286265 3289666 I'll bring it back to you<br />without any holes in it, I promise.
3292672 3293661 Good night, my dear.
3293739 3295604 Good night, Scarlett, darling.
3309255 3311485 Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,<br />for Mr. Ashley to leave?
3311557 3313286 Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
3313359 3316817 She isn't going to the depot with him?<br />She hasn't changed her mind?
3316896 3318591 No, ma'am. She's layin' down.
3318698 3322691 She's so upset Mist' Wilkes told her<br />she can't even come downstairs.
3329275 3330242 Ashley!
3334680 3337012 Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
3337583 3340916 Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you<br />as you are now...
3341153 3342916 ...not shivering at the depot.
3343456 3344650 All right.
3345324 3348157 Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.
3355167 3357135 Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.
3358037 3359766 Tie it on me, my dear.
3361040 3364908 While Melly was making your new tunic,<br />I made this to go with it.
3365311 3366573 You made it yourself?
3367613 3370446 Well, then I shall value it all the more.
3370816 3373876 You know there's nothing<br />I wouldn't do for you.
3374687 3376678 There's something you can do for me.
3376822 3377880 What is it?
3378291 3380350 Will you look after Melanie for me?
3381494 3384554 She's so frail and gentle<br />and she loves you so much.
3385031 3386396 You see, if I were killed and she...
3386465 3390094 Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.<br />Say a prayer quickly.
3390336 3391860 You say one for me.
3392905 3396272 We shall need all our prayers<br />now the end is coming.
3396576 3397543 The end?
3397610 3399077 The end of the war.
3399879 3401744 And the end of our world, Scarlett.
3403182 3406151 But, Ashley, you don't think<br />the Yankees are beating us?
3406218 3408914 Oh, Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...
3410089 3412455 ...and the snow in Virginia is deep.
3413192 3414659 When I see them...
3415094 3419428 ...and I see the Yankees coming<br />and coming, always more and more...
3422435 3425165 Well, when the end does come<br />I shall be far away.
3426138 3428629 It'll be a comfort to me to know<br />that she has you.
3429742 3431869 You will promise, won't you?
3434313 3435302 Yes.
3436716 3438445 Is that all, Ashley?
3439452 3442012 All except, goodbye.
3442688 3444622 Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.
3444690 3445816 - You must be brave...<br />- No...
3445891 3447188 You must.
3447793 3449784 How else can I bear going?
3450563 3454192 Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine<br />and strong and beautiful.
3455601 3457466 Not just your sweet face, my dear...
3458471 3459836 ...but you.
3463109 3465304 Oh, Ashley, kiss me.
3466112 3467773 Kiss me goodbye!
3474420 3475387 No, Scarlett.
3475488 3477080 Oh, Ashley, I love you.
3477657 3480558 I've always loved you.<br />I never loved anyone else.
3480860 3483226 I only married Charles just to hurt you.
3483396 3485762 Oh, Ashley. Tell me you love me.
3486799 3489267 I'll live on it the rest of my life.
3491137 3492263 Goodbye.
3512158 3514388 When the war is over, Ashley.
3515194 3517128 When the war is over.
3537316 3539079 <i>And there's a place back home...</i>
3539852 3543083 <i>...where a wild plum tree comes to flower</i><br /><i>in the springtime.</i>
3544390 3546017 <i>Down by the creek, you know.</i>
3546492 3548016 Yes, I know, I know.
3548961 3552260 When we were little,<br />my brother, Jeff, and I used to...
3552398 3555856 I told you about my brother, Jeff,<br />didn't I, ma'am?
3556335 3557632 I know I did.
3558037 3559163 He...
3559405 3562238 We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
3562742 3566041 Since Bull Run we haven't heard<br />anything and...
3566512 3568810 Please, we must have<br />your temperature now.
3568981 3571506 Just take this in your mouth<br />and not talk anymore.
3571717 3573150 Not just now.
3573519 3576317 Melanie, I'm so tired I've gotta go home.
3577456 3579117 Aren't you tired, Melanie?
3579658 3582286 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3582962 3584486 This might be...
3584730 3585754 ...Ashley.
3586499 3589366 And only strangers here to comfort him.
3589802 3591793 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3592972 3594667 They could all be...
3595174 3596436 ...Ashley.
3608687 3612623 I've been sittin' by this curb one solid hour<br />waitin' to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.
3612691 3615353 Go on, you trash,<br />don't you be pesterin' these ladies.
3615494 3616984 Don't talk to her, Melly.
3617062 3619223 It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?
3619498 3622023 My name's Belle Watlin'.<br />But that don't matter.
3622301 3624496 I expect you think<br />I've got no business here.
3624570 3627130 Hadn't you best tell me<br />what you want to see me about?
3627206 3630471 First time I come here, I says,<br />"Belle, you're a nurse."
3630676 3632769 But the ladies didn't want<br />my kind of nursin'.
3632845 3634938 Well, they was more than likely right.
3635014 3636777 Then I tried givin' 'em money.
3636916 3639384 My money wasn't good enough<br />for 'em, either.
3639518 3640849 Old pea-hens!
3641320 3643788 I know a gentleman<br />who says you're a human bein'.
3644056 3647651 If you are, which they ain't,<br />you'll take my money for the hospital.
3647726 3650957 What are you doing here?<br />Haven't you been told twice already?
3651030 3653021 This time I'm conversin' with Miss Wilkes.
3653098 3655089 You might as well take my money,<br />Miss Wilkes.
3655167 3657067 It's good money, even if it is mine.
3657369 3658961 I'm sure you're very generous.
3659038 3662166 No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate<br />like everybody else, that's all.
3662241 3663572 Of course you are.
3663843 3666107 There's some folks here<br />wouldn't feel that way.
3666178 3668703 But maybe they ain't<br />as good Christians as you.
3675988 3678718 Look, Mrs. Meade.<br />It's a great deal of money.
3679091 3681252 Ten, $20, $30, $50.
3681660 3683992 And it's not our paper money. It's gold.
3684563 3686258 Let me see that handkerchief.
3686632 3687758 "R. B."
3690236 3693433 And she's driving away<br />in Rhett Butler's carriage!
3694306 3697434 Oh, if I just wasn't a lady<br />what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
3732378 3735108 "The Lord is my Shepherd.<br />I shall not want.
3735381 3738009 "He maketh me to lie down<br />in green pastures.
3738317 3739511 "He leadeth...
3741854 3743481 "He restoreth my soul.
3744123 3747524 "He leadeth me in the paths<br />of righteousness for His name's sake.
3748227 3751458 "Yeah, though I walk through the valley<br />of the shadow of death...
3751830 3753457 "...I will fear no evil.
3753766 3755028 "For Thou art with me.
3755334 3757894 "Thy rod and Thy staff, they comfort me."
3758938 3759927 Yankees!
3760506 3763441 The Yankees!<br />Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
3763676 3768238 They'll never get into Atlanta.<br />They'll never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.
3769248 3771478 Give me something for the pain.
3771917 3773509 Give me something for the pain!
3773652 3775882 Sorry, son, we haven't got anything<br />to give you.
3777856 3780416 These animules is drivin' me crazy!
3781961 3783952 What luck! You've got my jack...!
3784196 3786790 Give me an ace and I'll start another war!
3786865 3788526 I'll bid the moon!
3792271 3796435 That I'll never see you or Pa again.
3797576 3799100 This leg's got to come off, soldier.
3799178 3801510 No, no! Leave me alone!
3801714 3802840 I'm sorry, soldier.
3802915 3804712 We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.
3804783 3806341 Then we'll have to operate without it.
3806418 3808215 No, no! Leave me alone!
3808520 3810818 You can't do it. I won't let you do it to me!
3810889 3813824 Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off<br />immediately. It's gangrene.
3813892 3816019 No, no! Don't!
3816295 3819025 I haven't seen my family in three days.
3819098 3820895 I'm going home for half an hour.
3821367 3822925 Orderly! Give me a lift.
3827139 3829232 Nurse, you can free this bed.
3830309 3831742 Miss Scarlett!
3833545 3835206 Why, Frank Kennedy!
3835280 3837339 Miss Suellen, is she well?
3837683 3840846 When did they bring you in?<br />You all right? Are you badly hurt?
3840919 3843513 - But Miss Suellen, is she...<br />- She's all right, but I...
3843589 3845489 Dr. Wilson needs you<br />in the operating room.
3845557 3847923 He's going to take off that leg.<br />Better hurry.
3849828 3851261 I'll be back.
3852631 3855122 No, no, leave me alone!
3855634 3858398 No, no, I can't stand it!
3858804 3861432 No don't! Don't cut!
3862274 3863605 Don't cut!
3864109 3865906 Don't, don't!
3866311 3867437 Please!
3867780 3869611 Where's the nurse?
3873452 3874942 Mrs. Hamilton, Dr. Wilson's waiting.
3875020 3877420 Let him wait! I'm going home!<br />I've done enough.
3877489 3880981 I don't want any more men dying!<br />I don't want any more!
