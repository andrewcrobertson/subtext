7353713 7356625 My back"s near broken.
7358233 7360383 Look at my hands!
7360593 7363790 Mother said you could always<br />tell a lady by her hands.
7364033 7368231 I guess things like hands and ladies<br />don"t matter so much anymore.
7368673 7372268 Rest, Sue. You"re not well yet.<br />I can pick cotton for both of us.
7372513 7375869 Scarlett"s hateful!<br />Making us work in the fields...
7376113 7378024 Too bad about that.
7378353 7381106 Get back to work. I can"t do<br />everything at Tara myself.
7381353 7383583 What do I care about Tara?<br />I hate Tara!
7386793 7389432 Don"t you ever dare say<br />you hate Tara again!
7390273 7392628 It"s the same as hating Pa and Ma.
7399673 7402107 There"s something I must<br />speak to you about.
7402353 7403149 What is it?
7403393 7406669 I don"t like the way you"re<br />treating Prissy and Mammy.
7406913 7411464 You must be firm with inferiors, but<br />gentle with them. Especially darkies.
7411713 7415308 I know. But l"m not asking<br />them to do what I don"t do myself.
7415513 7420223 Nevertheless, I don"t like it.<br />I shall speak to Mrs. O"Hara about it.
7434313 7437430 - What are you doing out of bed?<br />- I must talk to you.
7437673 7440426 You"re all working so hard.<br />I can"t just lie in bed.
7440673 7443028 Go upstairs.<br />You"re as weak as a newborn colt.
7443233 7445428 - Please, let me.<br />- Stop being noble.
7445673 7449348 I don"t need you making yourself<br />sick so you"ll never be any use.
7449593 7452426 I didn"t think of it that way.
7505393 7508226 Who"s there?<br />Halt or l"ll shoot!
7514073 7516029 You all alone, little lady?
7518553 7520828 You ain"t very friendly, are you?
7523513 7525947 You got anything else<br />besides these earbobs?
7526233 7528144 You Yankees have been here before.
7528913 7531222 Regular little spitfire, ain"t you?
7532513 7535027 What do you got hidden in your hand?
7568633 7571227 Scarlett, you killed him.
7571913 7573744 l"m glad you killed him.
7574913 7578428 Scarlett, what happened?<br />What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
7582313 7583348 Don"t be scared!
7583593 7587871 Your sister was cleaning a revolver<br />and it went off and scared her.
7588073 7590871 - Thank goodness!<br />- Haven"t we got enough to frighten us?
7591113 7594230 Tell Katie Scarlett she<br />must be more careful.
7596713 7598624 What a cool liar you are, Melly.
7599473 7601543 We gotta get him out of here<br />and bury him.
7601793 7603306 If the Yankees find him here...
7603513 7606471 I didn"t see anyone else.<br />I think he must be a deserter.
7606713 7608226 Even so, we"ve gotta hide him.
7608473 7612432 They might hear about it,<br />and then they"d come and get you.
7614833 7618064 I could bury him in the arbor<br />where the ground is soft...
7618313 7620269 ...but how will I get him<br />out of here?
7620513 7624222 - We"ll both take a leg and drag him.<br />- You couldn"t drag a cat.
7630313 7633271 Would it be dishonest if we<br />went through his haversack?
7633513 7635788 l"m ashamed I didn"t think<br />of that myself.
7635993 7638632 You take the haversack.<br />l"ll search his pockets.
7650393 7653590 You look. L"m feeling a little weak.
7654913 7656824 I think it"s full of money.
7657073 7659951 Melly, look. Just look!
7660193 7661023 10, 20, 30...
7661273 7663468 Don"t stop to count it now.<br />We haven"t got time!
7663713 7665669 Do you realize this means we can eat?
7665913 7668029 Look in his other pockets.
7669633 7671066 Hurry, hurry!
7671313 7673224 We"ve got to get him out of here.
7686353 7688913 If he bleeds across the yard,<br />we can"t hide it.
7689113 7691866 Give me your nightgown.<br />l"ll wad it round his head.
7692113 7697028 Don"t be silly, I won"t look at you.<br />If I had on pantalets, l"d use them.
7709913 7712427 Thank heavens l"m not that modest.
7713073 7715268 Go back to bed. You"ll<br />be dead if you don"t.
7715513 7717629 l"ll clean up my mess<br />when l"ve buried him.
7718113 7720308 No, l"ll clean it up.
7723473 7725623 Well, I guess l"ve done murder.
7727313 7731625 I won"t think about that now.<br />l"ll think about that tomorrow.
7742793 7744306 Katie Scarlett!
7744513 7746231 It"s over! Lt"s over!
7747273 7750424 It"s all over, the war.<br />Lee surrendered!
7750673 7752982 - It"s not possible.<br />- Why did we ever fight?
7753193 7754751 Ashley will be coming home.
7755313 7757269 Yes, Ashley will be coming home.
7757473 7761625 We"ll plant more cotton.<br />Cotton ought to go sky-high next year.
7784033 7785591 <i>The flag that makes you free</i>
7785793 7788830 <i>So we sing the chorus</i><br /><i>From Atlanta to the sea</i>
7789073 7792509 <i>While we were marching through Georgia</i>
7792713 7794624 Get out of the road, rebel!
7794833 7796983 Have you room<br />for a dying man?
7797233 7799349 Not for any Southern scum,<br />alive or dead.
7799593 7800503 Get out of the way!
7801033 7803706 I reckon he"d rather try<br />and walk it, at that.
7803953 7805944 Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
7806193 7808229 Acts like they won the war.
7808673 7811062 You come on, give me<br />them pants, Mr. Kennedy.
7811313 7812462 Come on!
7814513 7817823 Scrub yourself with that<br />lye soap, "fore I scrub you myself.
7818073 7821031 l"m gonna put these britches<br />in the boiling pot.
7823713 7825749 The whole army"s<br />got the same troubles...
7825993 7828507 ...crawling clothes and dysentery.
7828713 7830544 It"s humiliating how<br />you"re treating him.
7830833 7834428 You"d be a sight more humiliated<br />if Mr. Kennedy"s lice gets on you.
7836033 7837625 Oh, come on, Beau!
7837833 7841872 We must leave this gentleman alone<br />because he"s tired and he"s hungry.
7842113 7844832 I don"t mind, ma"am.<br />Good to see a youngster again.
7845033 7846227 Nice little fella.
7846433 7849584 Another two years, and we<br />could"ve had him in Cobb"s Legion.
7850713 7853432 - Were you in Cobb"s Legion?<br />- Yes, ma"am.
7853673 7856983 Why, then, you must know<br />my husband, Major Wilkes?
7858233 7860622 He was captured<br />at Spotsylvania, I think.
7860873 7864661 Captured? Oh, thank heaven!<br />Then he isn"t...
7864913 7867985 My poor Ashley, in a Yankee prison.
7868913 7871586 Yes, Scarlett, l"m coming.<br />Come along, Beau.
7871793 7874068 l"ll watch out for him.<br />We"re good friends.
7874313 7875826 Thank you.
7879713 7882830 I slave day and night just so we<br />can have enough food...
7883033 7885228 ...and you give it away<br />to scarecrows.
7885473 7889022 - L"d sooner have a plague of locusts.<br />- Don"t scold me, Scarlett.
7889233 7891793 l"ve just heard that Ashley<br />was taken prisoner.
7891993 7893426 Ashley a prisoner?
7893673 7897825 And maybe if he"s alive and well,<br />he"s on some Northern road right now.
7898073 7901031 Maybe a Northern woman<br />is giving him some of her dinner...
7901233 7904623 ...and helping my beloved<br />to come back home to me.
7906033 7907830 I hope so, Melly.
7911873 7916071 I want to take up something with your<br />Pa, but he doesn"t seem to...
7916313 7919430 Perhaps I can help you.<br />l"m head of the house now.
7921073 7923826 Miss Scarlett, I was aiming<br />to ask for Suellen.
7924713 7928786 Are you telling me you haven"t asked<br />for her after all these years?
7929873 7932512 The truth is, l"m so much<br />older than she is...
7932713 7934669 ...and now I haven"t<br />a cent to my name.
7934913 7936426 Who has, nowadays?
7936673 7939267 If true love carries any<br />weight with you...
7939513 7942152 ...you can be sure your sister<br />will be rich in that.
7942393 7945430 l"d go and get myself a<br />little business, if we"re engaged.
7945673 7947868 As soon as l"m on my feet again...
7948073 7951429 l"m sure I can speak for Pa.<br />You go ask her now.
7951873 7954831 Thank you.<br />Thank you, Miss Scarlett.
7957113 7959832 Excuse me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />Excuse me.
7961633 7964431 What seems to be<br />the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
7964633 7968228 More trouble than he guesses.<br />He"s finally asked for Suellen.
7968433 7969866 l"m so glad.
7970113 7974231 It"s a pity he can"t marry her now.<br />It"d be one less mouth to feed.
7977793 7979590 Another one!
7979833 7982028 - Hope he isn"t hungry.<br />- He"ll be hungry.
7982233 7984622 l"ll tell Prissy to get<br />an extra plate...
8014193 8015262 Don"t spoil it.
8015513 8018232 Turn me loose, you fool.<br />Turn me loose! Lt"s Ashley!
8018473 8020429 He"s her husband, ain"t he?
8032313 8034065 - Miss Scarlett?<br />- High time you got back.
8034313 8037191 - Did you get the horse shod?<br />- Yes"m, he"s shod.
8037393 8039668 Fine thing, horses<br />get shoes and humans can"t.
8039913 8041471 Here, stir this soap.
8041713 8042828 Miss Scarlett, ma"am?
8043073 8046145 I gotta know how much money<br />have you got left. In gold.
8046353 8048264 Ten dollars. Why?
8049033 8050182 That won"t be enough.
8050433 8052071 What are you talking about?
8052313 8056352 Well, I see"d that old no-count<br />white-trash Wilkerson...
8056593 8059027 ...that used to be<br />Mr. Gerald"s overseer here.
8059273 8062629 He"s a regular Yankee now,<br />and he was making a brag...
8062833 8067623 ...that his Carpetbagger friends run<br />the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
8067873 8072230 - How much more we got to pay?<br />- I hear the taxman say $300.
8072433 8073832 Three hundred...!
8074833 8079031 It might just as well be 3 million.<br />But we gotta raise it, that"s all.
8079273 8081833 Yes"m. How?
8083713 8087023 - L"ll go ask Mr. Ashley.<br />- He ain"t got no $300.
8087233 8089827 Well, I can ask him<br />if I want to, can"t I?
8091913 8093744 Asking ain"t getting.
8104833 8107825 They say Abe Lincoln got<br />his start splitting rails.
8108073 8111224 Just think what heights I may<br />climb to, once I get the knack.
8111913 8115223 The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
8115993 8117824 What shall we do?
8118113 8120422 Ashley, what"s to become of us?
8120633 8124023 What becomes of people<br />when their civilization breaks up?
8124233 8126827 Those with brains and courage<br />come through all right.
8127073 8128631 Those that haven"t are winnowed out.
8128873 8130067 For heaven"s sake...
8130313 8133623 ...don"t talk nonsense when it"s<br />us being winnowed out!
8133873 8138230 You"re right, Scarlett. Here I am<br />talking tommyrot about civilization...
8138473 8140464 ...while your Tara is in danger.
8140713 8143432 You"ve come to me for help,<br />and l"ve none to give.
8145673 8147425 l"m a coward.
8147793 8149829 You, Ashley? A coward?
8150393 8151872 What are you afraid of?
8152713 8156422 Mostly of life becoming<br />too real for me, I suppose.
8156633 8159067 Not that I mind splitting rails.
8159433 8164029 But I do mind very much losing<br />the beauty of that life I loved.
8165513 8170428 If the war hadn"t come, l"d have spent<br />my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
8170673 8171867 But the war did come.
8172433 8174867 I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
8175113 8178071 I saw men crumple up in agony<br />when I shot them.
8178913 8183270 And now I find myself in a world<br />which for me is worse than death.
8183513 8185583 A world in which there"s<br />no place for me.
8187673 8191222 I can"t make you understand.<br />You don"t know the meaning of fear.
8191433 8194027 You never mind facing realities.
8194713 8197102 You never want to escape<br />from them as I do.
8199713 8201226 Escape?
8202273 8206266 Ashley, you"re wrong.<br />I do want to escape too.
8206513 8211029 l"m so very tired of it all.<br />l"ve struggled for food and for money.
8211233 8214623 l"ve weeded, hoed and picked cotton<br />till I can"t stand it.
8214873 8217068 I tell you, the South is dead.<br />It"s dead!
8217313 8221022 The Yankees and Carpetbaggers<br />have it and left nothing for us.
8225233 8227952 Let"s run away.<br />We"d go to Mexico.
8228193 8231026 They want officers in the Mexican army.<br />We"d be happy.
8231233 8233224 l"d work for you.<br />l"d do anything for you!
8233433 8236743 You don"t love Melanie. You said<br />you loved me at Twelve Oaks.
8236993 8239029 And anyway, Melanie can"t...
8239633 8242864 Dr. Meade said she can"t have more<br />children. I could give you...
8243113 8244671 Can"t we ever forget<br />Twelve Oaks?
8244913 8247063 You think I could<br />ever forget? Have you?
8247313 8250225 Can you honestly say<br />you don"t love me?
8250913 8253188 - No, I don"t love you.<br />- It"s a lie!
8253393 8256226 Even so, do you think<br />l"d leave Melanie and the baby?
8256433 8259072 You couldn"t leave<br />your father and the girls.
8259313 8261508 l"m sick of them.<br />l"m tired of them!
8261713 8265228 Yes, you"re sick and tired.<br />That"s why you"re talking this way.
8266393 8268384 You"ve carried the load<br />for all of us.
8268593 8271505 From now on, l"ll be<br />more help to you. I promise.
8271713 8273624 There"s only one way you can help me.
8273873 8277832 Take me away.<br />There"s nothing to keep us here.
8278673 8280026 Nothing?
8281473 8283623 Nothing except honor.
8295713 8299262 Please, Scarlett.<br />Please, dear. You mustn"t cry.
8299513 8304029 You mustn"t. Please,<br />my brave dear, you mustn"t.
8315633 8318227 You do love me! You do love me!
8318433 8320663 - No, don"t, don"t.<br />- You love me.
8320913 8322983 I tell you, we won"t do it!
8323193 8325866 It won"t happen again. L"ll<br />take Melanie and go.
8326113 8328673 - Say it. You love me.<br />- All right, l"ll say it.
8328873 8332786 I love your courage and stubbornness<br />so much that I could forget...
8332993 8337430 ...the best wife a man ever had.<br />But l"m not going to forget her!
8346233 8348622 Then there"s nothing left for me.
8349593 8351629 Nothing to fight for.
8352313 8354429 Nothing to live for.
8356713 8358829 Yes, there is something.
8359473 8361987 Something you love better than me...
8362193 8364024 ...though you may not know it.
8369793 8371226 Tara.
8377633 8379624 I still have this.
8384073 8385631 You needn"t go.
8386193 8390232 I won"t have you all starve, simply<br />because I threw myself at your head.
8390873 8393023 It won"t happen again.
8419513 8420548 It"s Emmie Slattery.
8420793 8422021 - Yes"m, it"s me.<br />- Stop!
8423193 8426026 You haven"t forgotten your old<br />overseer, have you?
8426713 8428624 Emmie"s Mrs. Wilkerson now.
8428873 8431387 Get off those steps, you<br />wench! Get off this land!
8431793 8433431 You can"t speak that way to my wife.
8433673 8435629 Wife? High time you<br />made her your wife.
8435873 8438148 Who baptized your brats<br />after you killed my mother?
8438633 8440271 We came here to pay a call.
8440513 8443346 A friendly call, and talk<br />business with friends.
8443593 8445948 Friends? When were we ever friends?
8446193 8449105 Still high and mighty, ain"t you?<br />I know all about you.
8449353 8450672 Your father"s turned idiot.
8450913 8454622 You can"t pay your taxes, and I come<br />to offer to buy the place from you.
8454833 8458109 To make you a right good offer.<br />Emmie wants to live here.
8458353 8460230 Get off this place, you dirty Yankee!
8460473 8464864 You"ll find out who"s running things<br />when you get sold out for taxes.
8465113 8467308 l"ll buy this place<br />and l"ll live in it!
8467713 8470022 But l"ll wait for the sheriff"s sale.
8470273 8472628 That"s all of Tara you"ll ever get!
8473713 8475624 You"ll be sorry for that.
8483833 8485107 We"ll be back!
8485353 8487821 l"ll show you who<br />the owner of Tara is!
8492913 8494426 Pa, come back!
8497273 8499025 Pa, come back!
8501073 8502506 Yankee coward!
8530633 8533670 Lordy, Miss Scarlett,<br />that"s Mr. Gerald"s watch!
8533913 8535266 You take it. It"s for you.
8535513 8536741 Pa"d want you to have it.
8536993 8540065 You ain"t got no business<br />parting from this watch now.
8540313 8543464 You needs all your valuables<br />to sell for that tax money.
8543713 8546227 Do you think l"d sell Pa"s watch?
8547193 8549104 And don"t cry.
8549313 8551827 I can stand everybody"s<br />tears but yours.
8555593 8557823 Oh, Mammy, Mammy!
8562873 8567071 You"ve been brave so long.<br />You just gotta go on being brave.
8567273 8571027 - Think about your Pa like he used to be.<br />- I can"t think about Pa.
8571273 8573343 I can"t think of anything<br />but that $300.
8573593 8577825 Ain"t no good thinking about that.<br />Ain"t nobody got that much money.
8578113 8582026 Nobody but Yankees and Scalawags<br />got that much money now.
8583673 8584469 Rhett.
8584713 8587227 Who that? A Yankee?
8591313 8594783 Oh, Mammy, l"m so thin and pale...
8594993 8597223 ...and I haven"t any clothes.
8606313 8608827 Go and get Ma"s old box<br />of dress patterns.
8609073 8611667 - What you up to?<br />- You"ll make me a new dress.
8611913 8614222 Not with Miss Ellen"s <i>portières</i>!
8614473 8617067 Great balls of fire!<br />They"re my <i>portières</i> now.
8617313 8620828 l"m going to Atlanta for $300,<br />and l"ve got to look like a queen.
8621033 8622751 - Who"s going with you?<br />- L"ll go alone.
8622953 8626866 That"s what you think!<br />l"s going with you and that new dress.
8627113 8629786 - Mammy, darling.<br />- No use to try to sweet talk me.
8629993 8632348 I knows you since I put<br />diapers on you.
8632593 8635505 I said l"s going with you,<br />and going I is!
8635713 8638785 Kings in trade, eh?<br />Too good for me, major.
8639473 8641668 It"s a pity the war<br />wasn"t a poker game.
8641913 8644746 You"d done better than Grant,<br />with far less effort.
8644993 8645789 What is it?
8646033 8649469 There"s a lady to see Captain Butler.<br />Says she"s his sister.
8649713 8651192 Another sister?
8651433 8653628 This is a jail not a harem, captain.
8653873 8657104 No, she ain"t one of those.<br />She"s got her mammy with her.
8658113 8659831 She has?
8660433 8663823 l"d like to see this one, major.<br />Without her mammy.
8664993 8668622 Let"s see, my losses for<br />the afternoon come to what?
8669993 8671426 Three hundred and forty?
8671633 8674306 My debts do mount up,<br />don"t they, major?
8674513 8679109 All right, corporal, show Captain<br />Butler"s sister to his cell.
8679313 8682225 Thank you, major.<br />Excuse me, gentlemen.
8686313 8690784 It"s hard to be strict with a man<br />who loses money so pleasantly.
8691673 8694062 - Rhett!<br />- Scarlett!
8694313 8697225 My dear little sister!
8697593 8702030 It"s all right, corporal. My sister<br />has brought me no files or saws.
8706993 8708028 Can I really kiss you?
8708273 8710070 On the forehead, like a brother.
8710313 8713430 No, thanks. L"ll wait and hope<br />for better things.
8713673 8716471 I was so distressed when<br />I heard you were in jail.
8716713 8720467 I couldn"t sleep for thinking.<br />It"s not true they"ll hang you?
8720713 8722271 Would you be sorry?
8722473 8724065 Well, don"t worry yet.
8724313 8727271 They trumped up a charge,<br />but they really want my money.
8727513 8730073 They think I made off with<br />the Confederate treasury.
8730313 8732747 - Well, did you?<br />- What a leading question.
8732993 8735063 Let"s not talk about<br />things like money.
8735313 8738589 How good of you to come and see me.<br />And how pretty you look!
8738833 8741472 How you do run on, teasing<br />a country girl like me.
8741713 8746025 Thank heavens you"re not in rags. L"m<br />tired of women in rags. Turn around.
8746833 8748949 You look good enough to eat,<br />and prosperous.
8749193 8752469 l"ve been doing very well.<br />Everyone"s well at Tara, only...
8752713 8756069 ...I got so bored, I thought l"d<br />treat myself to a visit to town.
8756313 8758702 You"re heartless, but that"s<br />part of your charm.
8758913 8760949 You"ve got more charm<br />than the law allows.
8761193 8763423 I didn"t come to talk<br />silliness about me.
8763673 8766426 I was so miserable at the thought<br />of you in trouble.
8766633 8769431 I was mad at you when you<br />left me on the road to Tara.
8769633 8772466 - And I still haven"t forgiven you.<br />- Don"t say that.
8772713 8776501 Well, I must admit I might not be<br />alive now, only for you.
8776713 8780342 When I think of myself with anything<br />I could possibly hope for...
8780553 8784228 ...not a care in the world,<br />and you here in this horrid jail.
8784433 8788028 And not even a human jail,<br />Rhett, a horse jail!
8788633 8790942 Listen to me trying to make jokes...
8791153 8792825 ...when I really want to cry.
8793273 8794945 In a minute I shall cry.
8799793 8801272 Can it be possible that...
8801513 8803231 Can what be possible, Rhett?
8803473 8806829 That you"ve grown a woman"s heart?<br />A real woman"s heart.
8807073 8810031 I have, Rhett. I know I have.
8811793 8814944 It"s worth being in jail<br />just to hear you say that.
8816713 8818431 It"s well worth it.
8822673 8824982 You can drop the moonlight<br />and magnolia.
8825233 8828987 Things have been going well at Tara?<br />What"ve you done with your hands?
8829273 8834142 - I went riding without my gloves...<br />- You"ve been working like a field hand!
8834353 8836423 Why did you lie,<br />and what are you up to?
8836633 8839625 - I almost believed you cared.<br />- But I do care!
8839833 8842825 Let"s get down to the truth.<br />You want something enough...
8843033 8845069 ...to put on quite a<br />show in your velvets.
8845313 8847588 What is it? Money?
8847793 8850261 I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
8850513 8852868 I lied when I said<br />everything was all right.
8853113 8857425 Things are as bad as they possibly<br />could be. And you"ve got millions.
8858313 8859826 What collateral do you have?
8860033 8861466 - My earbobs.<br />- Not interested.
8861673 8863868 - Mortgage on Tara.<br />- What would I do with a farm?
8864073 8868305 - L"d pay you out of next year"s cotton.<br />- Not good enough.
8870833 8873028 You once said you loved me.
8873233 8874632 If you still love me...
8875393 8877702 You haven"t forgotten,<br />l"m not a marrying man.
8878513 8881152 No, I haven"t forgotten.
8886193 8888263 You"re not worth $300.
8888513 8891232 You"ll never mean anything<br />but misery to any man.
8891673 8894392 I don"t care what you say,<br />only give me the money.
8894633 8898626 I won"t let Tara go! I can"t while<br />there"s a breath left in my body.
8899833 8901869 Won"t you please give me the money?
8902113 8904069 I couldn"t if I wanted to.
8904313 8906144 My funds are in Liverpool,<br />not Atlanta.
8906393 8910022 If I drew a draft, they"d be on<br />me like a duck on a June bug.
8910233 8913828 So you see, my dear, you"ve abased<br />yourself to no purpose.
8916233 8920465 Here, here. Stop it! You want<br />the Yankees to see you like this?
8920713 8924626 Take your hands off me, you skunk!<br />You knew what I wanted.
8924873 8927910 You knew you wouldn"t lend me<br />the money, and you let me go on!
8928113 8930707 I enjoyed hearing what<br />you had to say. Cheer up.
8930913 8933063 Come to my hanging,<br />l"ll put you in my will.
8933273 8934945 l"ll come to your hanging!
8935193 8939027 l"m just afraid they won"t hang you<br />in time to pay the taxes on Tara!
8945313 8946792 Tell him Belle Watling.
8946993 8949826 Where you been? I thought<br />you deserted Captain Butler.
8950113 8952627 I keep myself occupied.<br />Help me out.
8960993 8964747 Who that? I ain"t never see"d hair<br />that color before in my life.
8964993 8966426 You know a dyed-haired woman?
8966673 8969665 Wish I knew that one.<br />She"d get my money for me.
8971673 8973470 Whatever they done<br />to you in there...
8973713 8977467 ...they didn"t do no more than you<br />deserve for visiting white trash.
8984113 8986229 - Fresh and green.<br />- Right off the farm.
8986433 8990028 - What you doing tonight, Susie?<br />- That"s one of those Georgia peaches!
8990273 8991865 Nothing like that in Ohio.
8992113 8994422 - You know what we"re gonna do?<br />- What?
8994633 8997431 We"re gonna give every one of you<br />40 acres and a mule.
8997673 9000312 - And a mule?<br />- 40 acres and a mule!
9001233 9002791 Because we"re your friend.
9003033 9007151 And you"re gonna become voters and<br />vote like your friends do!
9008993 9011348 - What"s your hurry?<br />- What"s come over this town?
9011553 9015148 Yankees have come over it.<br />Same as they"ve come over all of them.
9017193 9018990 Out of our way, trash!
9019233 9021747 Get out of the way here!<br />Get away! Go on.
9029713 9031146 It can"t be Miss Scarlett!
9031393 9032985 - Frank Kennedy!<br />- And Mammy.
9033233 9034985 It"s good to see home folks.
9035233 9037952 - I didn"t know you were in Atlanta.<br />- I didn"t know you were.
9038153 9040348 Didn"t Suellen tell you<br />about my store?
9040593 9043346 Did she? I don"t remember.<br />Have you a store?
9043793 9046944 - This?<br />- Won"t you come in, look around a bit?
9054833 9057188 I don"t suppose it looks like much<br />to a lady...
9057433 9059583 ...but I can"t help being proud of it.
9059833 9062552 - You"re not making money?<br />- Well, I can"t complain.
9062753 9064391 In fact, l"m mighty encouraged.
9064633 9066988 Folks tell me l"m just<br />a born merchant.
9067233 9069986 Won"t be long before<br />Miss Suellen and I can marry.
9070233 9073384 - Are you doing as well as all that?<br />- Yes, I am.
9073633 9075191 l"m no millionaire yet...
9075433 9077742 ...but l"ve cleared $ 1000 already.
9077993 9079392 And lumber too.
9080913 9083586 - That"s only a sideline.<br />- A sideline, Frank?
9083793 9087502 With all the good Georgia pine<br />around Atlanta, and all this building?
9087713 9090352 Well, all that takes money,<br />Miss Scarlett...
9090553 9092783 ...and I gotta think<br />about buying a home.
9093033 9094352 Why would you want a home?
9094553 9096703 For Suellen to set up housekeeping.
9097153 9098552 Here in Atlanta.
9098753 9100948 You"d want to bring her to Atlanta.
9101233 9103747 There wouldn"t be much help<br />in that for Tara.
9104593 9106424 I don"t know what you mean.
9107313 9108951 I don"t mean a thing.
9109593 9112312 How"d you like to drive me<br />to my Aunt Pitty"s?
9112513 9114743 Nothing"d give me more pleasure.
9114953 9116466 You better stay to supper.
9116713 9119750 Aunt Pitty"d be agreeable,<br />and l"d like a long visit.
9119953 9123343 You act on me just like a tonic,<br />Miss Scarlett.
9123633 9125589 And will you tell me all the news...
9125833 9127186 ...of Miss Suellen?
9130233 9133145 What"s the matter?<br />Miss Suellen"s not ill, is she?
9133633 9136989 Oh, no, no. I thought<br />surely she had written you.
9137193 9140310 I guess she was ashamed to write you.<br />She should be ashamed.
9140513 9142708 How awful to have such a mean sister.
9143033 9144671 You must tell me.
9144913 9146790 Don"t leave me on tenterhooks.
9147033 9150184 Well, she"s going to marry<br />one of the county boys next month.
9151233 9154748 She got tired of waiting, was afraid<br />she"d be an old maid and...
9154953 9157751 l"m sorry to be the one to tell you.
9158233 9160793 It"s cold, and I left my muff at home.
9161033 9164150 Would you mind if I put my hand<br />in your pocket?
9179513 9182186 But, Melanie, you don"t realize<br />what she"s done!
9182433 9184742 She"s gone and married my Mr. Kennedy!
9184993 9186949 He"s my beau and she"s married him!
9187193 9189070 She did it to save Tara.
9189313 9190268 I hate Tara!
9190513 9193949 I hate Scarlett! She"s the only thing<br />I hate worse than Tara!
9198033 9199751 It"s all my fault.
9200553 9203590 I should"ve committed robbery<br />to get that tax money for you.
9203833 9205983 I couldn"t let you do<br />anything like that.
9206233 9207586 Anyway, it"s done now.
9207793 9209863 Yes, it"s done now.
9210073 9212143 You won"t let me do<br />anything dishonorable...
9212353 9215311 ...yet you"d sell yourself in marriage<br />to a man you didn"t love.
9215513 9218186 You won"t have to worry<br />about my helplessness anymore.
9219833 9221152 What do you mean?
9221393 9223145 l"m going to New York.
9224353 9225991 l"ve arranged for<br />a position in a bank.
9226233 9228144 But you can"t do that.
9230233 9233543 I counted on you to help me start<br />a lumber business and...
9233753 9234663 I counted on you.
9234913 9237586 I don"t know anything<br />about the lumber business.
9237833 9240142 You know as much as you do<br />about banking...
9240393 9242987 ...and l"d give you half the business.
9243233 9245667 That"s generous of you, Scarlett.
9246033 9247546 But it isn"t that.
9247753 9250551 If I go to Atlanta and take help<br />from you again...
9250753 9253062 ...l"d bury any hope<br />of ever standing alone.
9253313 9254587 Oh, is that all?
9254793 9259344 You could gradually buy the business,<br />and then it would be your own and...
9259953 9261352 No, Scarlett.
9284353 9285547 Scarlett, what is it?
9285793 9288068 Ashley"s so mean and hateful!
9288313 9289951 What have you done?
9290633 9293067 She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
9293633 9297148 To help me start my lumber business.<br />And he won"t help me!
9297753 9299425 How unchivalrous of you.
9299633 9301544 Why, think, Ashley, think!
9301793 9304751 If it hadn"t been for Scarlett,<br />l"d have died in Atlanta...
9304953 9307308 ...and maybe we wouldn"t have<br />little Beau.
9307513 9309868 When I think of her picking cotton<br />and plowing...
9310113 9312547 ...just to keep food in our mouths,<br />I could just...
9312753 9314744 Oh, my darling.
9318633 9321272 All right, Melanie.<br />l"ll go to Atlanta.
9323353 9325184 I can"t fight you both.
9339433 9341344 Come on, lift them feet!
9343713 9346386 There"s your new mill hands,<br />Mrs. Kennedy.
9346633 9349545 The pick of all the best jails<br />in Georgia.
9349993 9352951 - They look thin and weak, Gallegher.<br />- Halt!
9355433 9356786 They"re the best you can lease.
9356993 9359587 If you"ll give Johnnie Gallegher<br />a free hand...
9359833 9361949 ...you"ll get what you want<br />out of them.
9362153 9363950 All right, you"re the foreman.
9364193 9367390 Just keep the mill running<br />and deliver my lumber when I want it.
9367633 9370352 Johnnie Gallegher"s your man, miss.<br />But remember...
9370593 9373027 ...no questions and no interference.
9373433 9375742 That"s a bargain.<br />Start in the morning.
9375993 9377824 Come on, get a move on there!
9378033 9382584 But this isn"t right, and you know it.<br />Bad enough to be a businesswoman...
9382793 9383987 Why do you complain?
9384233 9386349 You wouldn"t own a mill<br />if I didn"t take over.
9386553 9388145 But I didn"t want the mill.
9388353 9392062 We couldn"t buy it if you hadn"t<br />pressed our friends for their debts.
9392313 9393143 Isn"t that right?
9393353 9395344 Are you running<br />a charitable institution?
9395593 9398869 Go back to the store, and go home<br />and take your medicine.
9399113 9400592 Sugar, don"t you think...?
9400833 9404348 Great balls of fire! Don"t bother me.<br />And don"t call me sugar.
9404553 9407863 All right. All right.<br />Good night, Ashley.
9408433 9409912 My, my!
9410113 9413150 She can get mad quicker<br />than any woman I ever saw.
9414433 9416185 I don"t like to interfere...
9416393 9419590 ...but I wish you"d let me hire<br />darkies and not use convicts.
9419833 9420948 We could do better.
9421193 9423832 Darkies" pay would break us.<br />Convicts are cheap.
9424073 9425665 If we give Gallegher a free hand...
9425913 9428985 A free hand? That means<br />he"ll starve and whip them.
9429233 9431144 Didn"t you see them?<br />Some are sick.
9431353 9432672 How you do run on.
9432913 9435381 If I let you alone,<br />you"d give them chicken...
9435633 9437589 ...and tuck them in with quilts.
9437833 9441382 I won"t make money out of the<br />enforced labor and misery of others.
9441633 9443066 You didn"t mind owning slaves.
9443393 9445782 That was different.<br />We didn"t treat them that way.
9446033 9447989 l"d have freed them<br />when father died...
9448233 9450269 ...if the war hadn"t<br />already freed them.
9450513 9451946 l"m sorry, Ashley.
9452153 9454269 Do you forget what it"s like<br />without money?
9454513 9457152 Money is the most<br />important thing in the world.
9457353 9459389 I don"t intend to be without it again.
9459633 9463751 l"ll make enough the only way I know<br />how so the Yankees can"t take Tara.
9463993 9466268 We"re not the only Southerners<br />who"ve suffered.
9466513 9469983 Look at all our friends. They"re<br />keeping their honor and kindness.
9470233 9473589 And they"re starving. L"ve no use<br />for fools who won"t help themselves.
9473833 9475949 I know what they say about me.<br />I don"t care.
9476153 9478792 l"ll befriend Carpetbaggers<br />and beat them at their own game.
9479033 9480785 And you"ll beat them with me.
9483233 9486270 That"s it. Pull it<br />a little over to that side.
9486513 9488947 - Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.<br />- Good afternoon.
9489193 9491832 - Business is certainly growing.<br />- It certainly is.
9493353 9495389 You"re doing business<br />with the people...
9495633 9498466 ...who robbed us, tortured us<br />and left us to starve.
9498713 9499668 All that"s past.
9499913 9503349 I intend to make the best of things,<br />even if they are Yankee things.
9505873 9508945 And do you know that Dr. Meade<br />actually saw her...
9509153 9511348 ...peddling lumber to Yankees herself?
9511553 9512349 That isn"t all.
9512553 9515147 It"s shocking what she"s doing<br />to my brother.
9515353 9518151 She"s even taken to driving<br />her own buggy.
9525353 9528584 My dear Mrs. Kennedy.<br />My very dear Mrs. Kennedy!
9528793 9530988 I don"t see how you have<br />the gall to face me!
9531193 9534742 You could"ve had my millions<br />if you"d just waited a while.
9534993 9536346 Oh, how fickle is woman!
9536593 9538743 What is it you want?<br />I have things to do.
9538953 9542741 Will you satisfy my curiosity on a<br />point which has always bothered me?
9542953 9544102 Well, what is it?
9544633 9548546 Tell me, do you never shrink<br />from marrying men you don"t love?
9548833 9551950 How"d you get out of jail?<br />Why didn"t they hang you?
9552433 9555550 Oh, that! There"s nothing much<br />that money won"t buy.
9555753 9558950 I observe it"s even bought you<br />the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
9559233 9562987 So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.<br />I believe you"re jealous of him.
9563233 9567749 You still think you"re the belle of the<br />county, the cutest trick in shoe leather.
9567993 9569949 That every man is in love with you.
9570153 9570949 Let me by.
9571833 9574745 Don"t be angry.<br />Tell me, where are you going?
9574953 9577945 - L"m going out to the mill.<br />- Through Shantytown alone?
9578193 9581344 It"s dangerous to drive alone<br />through all that riffraff.
9581593 9582946 Don"t worry about me.
9583153 9586350 I can shoot straight,<br />if I don"t have to shoot too far.
9593193 9594751 What a woman!
9628033 9629148 Give me a quarter.
9629553 9630872 Let go of my horse!
9633113 9634546 Hold this horse.
9640393 9641985 - Let go!<br />- Give me that gun.
9644753 9645947 Help!
9646153 9646949 Help!
9701433 9702229 Wait!
9702633 9704351 Miss Scarlett, wait!
9706193 9707706 - It"s Sam!<br />- Big Sam?
9708353 9709388 Miss Scarlett, wait!
9713953 9716945 Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br />Did they hurt you?
9717593 9721347 Don"t you cry. Big Sam will get<br />you out of this in a jiffy.
9722113 9723751 Horse, make tracks!
9727033 9729183 Get to Tara as quick as you can<br />and stay there.
9729433 9731788 I will. L"s had enough<br />of them Carpetbaggers.
9732033 9733989 Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br />Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
9734233 9735746 Goodbye, Sam. Thank you.
9735993 9738951 Change your dress and go over<br />to Miss Melly"s.
9739193 9740785 l"ve got to go<br />to a political meeting.
9741033 9745470 How can you go to a political meeting<br />after what l"ve been through?
9745713 9748386 Oh, sugar. You"re more scared<br />than hurt.
9748593 9750185 Nobody cares about me.
9750433 9753345 You all act as though<br />it were nothing at all.
9773433 9775867 The men talk<br />about protecting our women...
9776113 9780152 ...and then after what happened to me,<br />Frank went to a political meeting.
9783753 9786551 And if it won"t pain you too much,<br />India Wilkes...
9786753 9790632 ...tell me why you"re staring at me.<br />Has my face gone green?
9790833 9792152 It won"t pain me.
9792393 9794782 What happened today was<br />just what you deserved.
9795033 9796864 With any justice,<br />you"d have gotten worse.
9797113 9799991 - India, hush up.<br />- Let her talk. She"s always hated me.
9800233 9803623 Ever since I took Charles away,<br />though she won"t admit it.
9803913 9806746 If she thought anybody"d notice,<br />she"d walk the street naked.
9806953 9808944 I do hate you!
9809353 9812504 You"ve done all you could to lower<br />the prestige of decent people.
9812713 9816149 Now you"ve endangered the lives<br />of our men because they"ve got to...
9816353 9819902 We"d better not say any more,<br />or one of us will be saying too much.
9820113 9822502 What"s going on<br />that I don"t know about?
9828153 9832351 Somebody"s coming up the walk.<br />Somebody that ain"t Mr. Ashley.
9832553 9835147 Will you hand me the pistol,<br />Mrs. Meade?
9841153 9842745 Whoever it is...
9843273 9844945 ...we know nothing.
9848233 9851350 Where have they gone?<br />Tell me. It"s life or death.
9851593 9853549 Don"t tell him.<br />He"s a Yankee spy.
9853793 9855306 Quickly. There may be time.
9856273 9857069 How"d you know?
9857273 9858592 I played poker with Yankees.
9858833 9861552 They knew there"d be trouble.<br />They sent the cavalry out.
9861793 9863545 Your men are walking<br />into a trap.
9863793 9866546 Don"t tell him.<br />He"s trying to trap you.
9869033 9871945 Out the Decatur road.<br />The old Sullivan plantation.
9872193 9873672 They"re meeting in the cellar.
9873873 9875352 l"ll do what I can.
9879833 9882791 What"s this about?<br />If you don"t tell me, l"ll go crazy.
9883033 9884546 We thought it best not to tell you.
9884753 9888462 The men have gone to clean out<br />the woods where you were attacked.
9888713 9891750 It"s what many of our Southern men<br />have had to do to protect us.
9891993 9896350 And if they"re captured, they"ll be<br />hanged. And it will be your fault.
9896593 9898265 Another word and you must leave.
9898513 9900390 Scarlett did what she had to do.
9900633 9903352 Our men are doing what<br />they think they have to do.
9903913 9905141 Frank...
9905553 9907145 ...and Ashley.
9909033 9911342 Oh, it isn"t possible.
9914033 9916388 There"s horses, Miss Melly.<br />Here they come.
9916593 9918549 We"re sewing, we"re sewing!
9922753 9923742 Open the door.
9933793 9935545 Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
9937913 9939312 Who is Mrs. Wilkes?
9939513 9941151 I am Mrs. Wilkes.
9941353 9944504 - I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes.<br />- He"s not here.
9945113 9947946 - Are you sure?<br />- Don"t you doubt Miss Melly"s word!
9948193 9950388 I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
9950633 9952749 If you give me your word,<br />I won"t search the house.
9953113 9956742 Mr. Wilkes is at a political meeting<br />at Mr. Kennedy"s store.
9956953 9961026 He"s not at the store. There"s no<br />meeting tonight, no political meeting.
9961433 9964345 We"ll wait outside till<br />he and his friends return.
9965353 9968072 Surround the house.<br />Put a man on each door and window.
9973633 9975942 Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
9976233 9978701 And l"ll read aloud.
9981833 9985542 <i>The Personal History and Experience</i><br /><i>of David Copperfield. </i>
9987833 9989152 Chapter One.
9989353 9990342 I am born.
9994753 9998951 To begin my life with the beginning of<br />my life, I record that I was born...
9999233 10001428 Chapter Nine.<br />I have a memorable birthday.
10001673 10003550 I pass over all that happened<br />at school...
10003753 10007632 ...until the anniversary<br />of my birthday came round in March.
10008033 10011423 Except that Steerforth was more to be<br />admired than ever, I remember nothing.
10011833 10013869 He was going away<br />at the end of the half-year...
10014153 10018351 ...if not sooner, and was more<br />spirited and independent than before.
10018593 10020663 And therefore, more engaging<br />than before...
10020873 10023341 ...but beyond this,<br />I remember nothing.
10023593 10024742 The great...
10027033 10028261 I remember nothing.
10032993 10034904 Melly, they"re drunk!
10035393 10039068 Leave this to me, Scarlett.<br />And, please, say nothing.
10042033 10044342 You stupid fool!
10045593 10046742 Quiet!
10047433 10049344 Will you shut up, for the love of...
10049713 10050543 Hello, Melly.
10050753 10054985 So you"ve got my husband intoxicated<br />again. Well, bring him in.
10055233 10057383 l"m sorry, your husband"s<br />under arrest.
10057633 10061945 If you arrest all the drunks in Atlanta,<br />you must arrest a good many Yankees.
10062153 10065543 Bring him in, Captain Butler,<br />if you can walk yourself.
10066633 10068146 - Wait.<br />- I wanna tell you a story.
10068393 10069667 Listen, doctor, I...
10069873 10071750 Put him down in that chair.
10074993 10077302 Now, captain,<br />please leave my house...
10077513 10079947 ...and try to remember<br />not to come here again.
10080193 10082912 That"s fine thanks I get<br />for bringing him home...
10083113 10085673 ...and not leaving him<br />in this shameful condition.
10085873 10087511 Now, boys, all together...
10087713 10089465 Dr. Meade!
10089793 10091863 l"m astonished at you!
10099033 10101149 How can you do this to me?
10101993 10104348 I ain"t so very drunk, Melly.
10104713 10107102 Take him to the bedroom.<br />Lay him out on the bed.
10107313 10109781 - Don"t touch him. He"s under arrest.<br />- Now, Tom.
10110033 10113582 What do you want to arrest him for?<br />l"ve seen him drunker.
10113833 10116142 l"ve seen you drunker.<br />And you"ve seen me...
10116393 10119669 He can lie in the gutter<br />for all I care. L"m not a policeman.
10119913 10124031 He led a raid on that Shantytown<br />where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble.
10124433 10127152 A lot of shanties were burned.<br />A couple of men were killed.
10127393 10130942 It"s time you rebels learned you can"t<br />take the law into your own hands.
10131393 10133145 What are you laughing at?
10134513 10136981 This isn"t your night to teach<br />that lesson.
10137233 10139986 These two have been<br />with me tonight. Yes, sir.
10140233 10141951 With you, Rhett?
10142433 10143752 Where?
10147353 10149583 I don"t like to say<br />in the presence of ladies.
10150113 10151182 You"d better say.
10151833 10153710 Come out on the porch<br />and l"ll tell you.
10153913 10157542 Speak out. I think I have a right<br />to know where my husband"s been.
10159833 10161152 Well, ma"am...
10161353 10163992 ...we dropped in<br />on a friend of mine...
10164233 10165746 ...and the captain"s.
10165953 10167227 Mrs. Belle Watling.
10168433 10171982 We played cards<br />and drank champagne...
10173233 10176703 Now you"ve done it. Did you have to<br />show me up in front of my wife?
10178113 10179785 I hope you"re satisfied.
10180033 10182911 These ladies won"t be speaking<br />with their husbands.
10183473 10186465 Well, Rhett, I had no idea.
10187793 10192708 Look here, will you take an oath that<br />they were with you tonight at Belle"s?
10193113 10195866 Ask Belle if you don"t believe me.<br />She"ll tell you.
10196113 10198183 Will you give me your word,<br />as a gentleman?
10198433 10199582 As a gentleman?
10199833 10201744 Why, certainly, Tom.
10203633 10207262 Well, if l"ve made a mistake,<br />l"m sorry.
10208033 10210547 I hope you"ll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes.
10211993 10213711 If you"ll leave us in peace.
10214073 10216462 Well, I say l"m sorry.
10217633 10218986 Well, I am sorry.
10219233 10220746 Come on, sergeant.
10227193 10229548 Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
10232193 10234343 He"s all right.<br />It"s only in the shoulder.
10234593 10236868 Get him on the bed<br />where I can dress the wound.
10237113 10238944 I think I can walk.
10239313 10241065 It"s not worth the effort.<br />Which way?
10241313 10242541 In here.
10243913 10245392 Mammy, I want hot water.
10245793 10247146 And lint for bandages.
10247353 10249947 What can I use for a probe?<br />If I only had my bag.
10250193 10253151 Were you really there?<br />What did it look like?
10253393 10257147 Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br />plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
10257393 10260351 Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br />remember yourself.
10262313 10265464 Captain Butler, tell me what happened,<br />all that happened.
10265713 10267351 I was too late.
10267593 10270949 When I got to the Sullivan place,<br />there had already been a skirmish.
10271193 10273946 I found Mr. Wilkes wounded,<br />and Dr. Meade was with him.
10274153 10278146 I had to prove they"d been somewhere,<br />anyplace but where they were.
10278433 10281391 - So I took them to Belle"s.<br />- And she took them in?
10281633 10284705 She"s by way of being<br />an old friend of mine.
10284913 10285948 l"m sorry...
10286153 10289543 l"m sorry I couldn"t think up<br />a more dignified alibi.
10292553 10295943 This isn"t the first time you"ve come<br />between me and disaster.
10296193 10299549 It isn"t likely that l"d question<br />any device of yours.
10300993 10304747 And now l"ll go and see<br />what Dr. Meade needs.
10315553 10318704 Have you no interest in what"s become<br />of your own husband?
10321513 10323743 Did Frank go with you<br />to Belle Watling"s?
10323993 10325346 No.
10325633 10326622 Where is he?
10327593 10330153 He"s lying out on Decatur Road...
10330433 10332344 ...shot through the head.
10332953 10334352 He"s dead.
10343793 10344987 Who is it?
10345233 10346348 It"s Mrs. Watling.
10346553 10349272 Oh, Mrs. Watling.<br />Won"t you come in the house?
10349513 10352266 Oh, no, I couldn"t do that,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
10352513 10354947 You come in and sit a minute with me.
10362433 10366062 How can I thank you enough<br />for what you did for us?
10366313 10369191 I got your note saying you would<br />call on me and thank me.
10369433 10372470 Why, Mrs. Wilkes,<br />you must have lost your mind.
10372713 10376547 I came as soon as it was dark to say<br />you mustn"t think of any such thing.
10376793 10378351 Why, l"m...
10378633 10379952 Well, you"re...
10380233 10381746 It wouldn"t be fitting at all.
10381953 10385582 It wouldn"t be fitting for me to thank<br />a woman who saved my husband"s life?
10385833 10390543 Mrs. Wilkes, there ain"t never been<br />a lady nice to me like you was.
10390753 10393347 I mean, about the money<br />for the hospital.
10393553 10395145 I don"t forget a kindness.
10395633 10398386 I thought about you being widowed<br />with a little boy...
10398633 10400544 ...if Mr. Wilkes got hung.
10400753 10403950 He"s a nice little boy,<br />your boy is, Mrs. Wilkes.
10404393 10406861 I got a boy myself, so I...
10407233 10409667 You have? Does he live...?
10409873 10412341 Oh, no, he ain"t here in Atlanta.
10412753 10414391 He ain"t never been here.
10414633 10416544 He"s off at school.
10416953 10419342 I ain"t seen him since he was little.
10421793 10425672 Anyways, if it had been that<br />Mrs. Kennedy"s husband by hisself...
10425913 10428985 ...I wouldn"t have lifted a finger,<br />no matter what Rhett said.
10429233 10430985 She"s a mighty cold woman...
10431233 10433542 ...prancing about Atlanta by herself.
10433753 10436347 She killed her husband<br />same as if she shot him.
10436593 10439744 You mustn"t say unkind things<br />about my sister-in-law.
10442633 10444669 Please don"t freeze me, Mrs. Wilkes.
10444913 10447143 I forgot how you liked her.
10447633 10451945 She just ain"t in the same class with<br />you, and I can"t help it if I think so.
10452433 10455186 Well, anyways, I gotta be going.
10455433 10458982 l"m scared somebody"ll recognize<br />this carriage if I stay any longer.
10459233 10461349 That wouldn"t do you no good.
10461753 10464950 And, Mrs. Wilkes, if you ever see me<br />on the street...
10465153 10467348 ...you don"t have to speak to me.
10467553 10469145 l"ll understand.
10469433 10471549 I should be proud to speak to you.
10471753 10474142 Proud to be under obligation to you.
10474393 10475872 I hope we meet again.
10476113 10479071 Oh, no. That wouldn"t be fitting.
10480393 10483544 - Good night, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />- Good night, Mrs. Watling.
10488313 10490144 And you"re wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
10490393 10492953 She"s brokenhearted about her husband.
10535033 10536546 Great balls of fire!
10536793 10538146 It"s Rhett.
10562433 10566745 Captain Butler here to see you. I<br />told him you was prostrate with grief.
10566993 10570349 Tell him l"ll be right down, Mammy.
10598913 10600346 She says she"s coming.
10600593 10602584 I don"t know why she"s coming,<br />but she"s coming.
10602833 10604152 You don"t like me, Mammy.
10604393 10607351 Don"t you argue with me.<br />You don"t. You really don"t.
10619113 10620990 It"s no good, Scarlett.
10621233 10623542 - What?<br />- The cologne.
10624393 10625872 I don"t know what you mean.
10626113 10629992 I mean you"ve been drinking.<br />Brandy. Quite a lot.
10630233 10633350 Well, what if I have?<br />Is that any of your affair?
10634953 10636466 Don"t drink alone.
10636713 10640467 People always find out,<br />and it ruins a reputation.
10645713 10646668 What is it?
10646913 10649268 This is more than losing old Frank.
10650553 10651747 l"m so afraid.
10651993 10654382 I don"t believe it.<br />You"ve never been afraid.
10654633 10656066 l"m afraid now.
10656313 10658952 l"m afraid of dying and going to hell.
10660113 10662752 You look healthy.<br />And maybe there isn"t any hell.
10662953 10666741 Oh, there is. I know there is.<br />I was raised on it.
10666953 10669990 Far be it from me to question<br />the teachings of childhood.
10670513 10673949 Tell me what you"ve done<br />that hell yawns before you.
10674593 10676982 I ought never to have married Frank.
10677233 10680270 He was Suellen"s beau,<br />and he loved her, not me.
10680513 10683391 And I made him miserable,<br />and I killed him.
10683633 10685942 Yes, I did. I killed him.
10687313 10689349 Rhett, for the first time...
10689593 10693142 ...l"m finding out what it is<br />to be sorry for something l"ve done.
10693833 10696108 Here. Dry your eyes.
10696833 10699586 If you had it all to do over again,<br />you"d do no differently.
10699833 10702347 You"re like the thief who isn"t<br />sorry he stole...
10702553 10704783 ...but he"s terribly sorry he"s<br />going to jail.
10705033 10707672 l"m glad Mother"s dead.
10707913 10711144 l"m glad she"s dead<br />so she can"t see me.
10711353 10714948 I always wanted to be like her,<br />calm and kind...
10715153 10718350 ...and sadly, l"ve turned out<br />disappointing.
10719393 10723750 You know, Scarlett, I think<br />you"re on the verge of a crying jag.
10730433 10733391 So l"ll change the subject<br />and say what I came to say.
10733633 10735544 Say it, then, and get out!
10736513 10740142 - What is it?<br />- I can"t go on any longer without you.
10741113 10743946 You are the most ill-bred man<br />to come here at a time...
10744193 10746787 I made up my mind you were<br />the only woman for me...
10747033 10748386 ...the first day I saw you.
10748633 10750544 Now you have a mill<br />and Frank"s money...
10750793 10752943 ...and won"t come to me<br />as you did to the jail.
10753153 10757351 - So I see I shall have to marry you.<br />- I never heard of such bad taste.
10757553 10759589 Would you be convinced<br />if I fell to my knees?
10759953 10761466 Turn me loose and get out.
10761713 10764546 Forgive me for startling you<br />with my impetuous sentiments...
10764793 10767182 ...my dear Scarlett...<br />I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
10767433 10770266 But you must have noticed<br />that for some time...
10770513 10773664 ...the friendship l"ve felt for you<br />has ripened into a deeper feeling.
10773913 10777952 A feeling more beautiful,<br />more pure, more sacred...
10778153 10780189 Dare I name it? Can it be love?
10780833 10783188 Get up. I don"t like<br />your common jokes.
10783433 10785344 This is an honorable proposal...
10785593 10788426 ...made at what I consider<br />a most opportune moment.
10788633 10791784 I can"t go all my life waiting<br />to catch you between husbands.
10792033 10794911 You"re coarse and you"re conceited.
10795113 10797946 And I think this conversation"s<br />gone far enough.
10798473 10801192 Besides, I shall never marry again.
10801793 10804512 Oh, yes, you will.<br />And you"ll marry me.
10804753 10806664 You? You?
10807153 10808711 I don"t love you.
10808953 10811751 And I don"t like being married.
10811993 10814109 Ever think of marrying<br />just for fun?
10814353 10815706 Marriage, fun?
10815913 10818507 Fiddle-dee-dee!<br />Fun for men, you mean.
10818753 10820232 Do you want them to hear you?
10820473 10822623 You"ve been married to<br />a boy and an old man.
10822873 10826343 Why not try a husband of the right age,<br />with a way with women?
10826593 10828709 You"re a fool, Rhett Butler...
10828953 10831911 ...when you know I shall always love<br />another man.
10832193 10834309 Stop it. You hear me? Stop it.
10834553 10836305 No more of that talk.
10841473 10842747 Don"t. I shall faint.
10842993 10845553 I want you to faint.<br />This is what you"re meant for.
10845793 10848227 None of those fools<br />have kissed you like this.
10848473 10851704 Your Charles or your Frank<br />or your stupid Ashley.
10859193 10862105 Say you"re going to marry me.<br />Say yes. Say yes.
10862353 10863706 Yes.
10865593 10868312 Are you sure you meant it?<br />You don"t want to take it back?
10869593 10871948 Look at me,<br />and try to tell me the truth.
10872193 10874548 Did you say yes because of my money?
10874793 10877546 Well, yes, partly.
10878513 10879707 Partly?
10880153 10882542 Well, you know, Rhett,<br />money does help.
10882793 10885751 - And, of course, I am fond of you.<br />- Fond of me?
10885993 10889303 If I said I was madly in love<br />with you, you"d know I was lying.
10889513 10893028 - You say we have a lot in common...<br />- Yes, you"re right, my dear.
10893273 10895309 l"m not in love<br />any more than you are.
10895513 10898152 Heaven help the man<br />who ever really loves you.
10898393 10900111 What kind of ring would you like?
10900353 10903151 A diamond ring, and do buy<br />a great big one.
10903393 10906305 You"ll have the biggest<br />and most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
10906553 10910023 l"ll take you to New Orleans<br />for the most expensive honeymoon.
10910273 10913549 - That"d be heavenly.<br />- L"ll buy your trousseau for you too.
10913793 10915829 How wonderful...
10916073 10918348 ...but you won"t tell anybody,<br />will you?
10918593 10920902 Still the little hypocrite.
10922793 10924511 Won"t you kiss me goodbye?
10924753 10927142 You"ve had enough kissing<br />for one afternoon.
10927393 10930624 You"re impossible. You can go.<br />I don"t care if you never come back.
10930873 10932704 But I will come back.
10946513 10948344 What are you thinking about?
10948593 10951107 l"m thinking about how rich we are.
10952353 10954344 I can keep the lumber business too?
10954593 10956902 Yes, of course you can,<br />if it amuses you.
10957153 10961112 Now that you"re so rich, you can tell<br />everybody to go to the devil.
10961313 10964305 But you were the main one<br />I wanted to go to the devil.
10980873 10984309 Don"t scrape the plate.<br />l"m sure there"s more in the kitchen.
10985353 10988186 Can I have a chocolate one<br />stuffed with meringue?
10988433 10991345 If you don"t stop being a glutton,<br />you"ll get as fat as Mammy.
10991593 10993151 And l"ll divorce you.
10993913 10996143 It"d be nice if you bought<br />something for Mammy.
10996393 10999749 Why should I buy her a present<br />when she called us both mules?
10999993 11001346 Mules? Why mules?
11001593 11005950 She said we could give ourselves air<br />and get slicked up like racehorses...
11006193 11009708 ...but we were just mules in horse<br />harness and we didn"t fool anybody.
11009993 11013349 I never heard anything more true.<br />Mammy"s a smart old soul.
11013593 11017302 And one of the few people I know<br />whose respect l"d like to have.
11017913 11021303 - I won"t give her a thing.<br />- Then l"ll take her a petticoat.
11021513 11025301 My mammy said when she went to heaven,<br />she wanted a red taffeta petticoat...
11025553 11027623 ...so stiff that it"d stand<br />by itself...
11027873 11030706 ...and so rustley the Lord would<br />say it"s made of angels" wings.
11030913 11033632 She won"t take it from you.<br />She"d rather die than wear it.
11033873 11037309 That may be. But l"m making<br />the gesture just the same.
11040993 11043302 Wake up. Wake up!
11044793 11047102 You were having another nightmare.
11049193 11053152 Rhett, I was so cold<br />and hungry and so tired.
11053393 11057750 I couldn"t find it. I ran through<br />the mist and I couldn"t find it.
11057993 11060507 - Find what, honey?<br />- I don"t know.
11060713 11063511 I always dream the same dream,<br />and I never know.
11063713 11065624 It seems to be hidden in the mist.
11065873 11067306 Darling...
11067993 11072703 Do you think l"ll ever dream<br />that I found it, and that l"m safe?
11073193 11075104 Dreams don"t work that way.
11075353 11077503 When you get used to being<br />safe and warm...
11077713 11079749 ...you"ll stop dreaming that dream.
11079993 11083588 And, Scarlett, l"m going to see<br />that you are safe.
11086193 11089310 Would you do something for me<br />if I asked you?
11089553 11091305 You know I would.
11091913 11093949 Will you take me away from here?
11094393 11097703 - Don"t you like New Orleans?<br />- I love New Orleans...
11097913 11100427 ...but I want to go home<br />and visit Tara.
11100673 11102709 Will you take me to Tara?
11102953 11105626 Yes, Scarlett. Of course I will.
11106393 11108111 We"ll go tomorrow.
11110553 11113113 You get your strength<br />from this red earth of Tara.
11113313 11115031 You"re part of it<br />and it"s part of you.
11115273 11118743 l"d give anything to have Tara<br />the way it was before the war.
11118993 11120108 Would you?
11120473 11123351 Go ahead and make it that way.<br />Spend whatever you want.
11123593 11125948 Make it as fine a plantation<br />as it ever was.
11127993 11129506 You are good to me.
11129713 11131829 Can we still have our big new house<br />in Atlanta?
11132073 11134712 Yes. And it can be<br />as ornate as you want.
11134913 11137108 Marble terraces,<br />stained-glass windows.
11137353 11138945 Won"t everyone be jealous!
11139193 11143106 I want everybody who"s been mean to me<br />to be pea-green with envy.
11143953 11145750 I don"t care. Scarlett"s hateful...
11145993 11148109 ...building that new house<br />just to show off!
11148313 11150907 And even taking our servants!
11151153 11154145 Oh, darling, you mustn"t think<br />unkindly of her.
11154393 11157112 She"s made it possible for us<br />to keep Tara, always.
11157353 11159105 And what good is Tara?
11159353 11163710 She"s had three husbands,<br />and l"ll be an old maid!
11165593 11167743 Great Jehoshaphat!
11168193 11169865 Great Jehoshaphat!
11170193 11172946 Lordy, we sure is rich now.
11173833 11176552 That"s ridiculous!<br />Why can"t I go in?
11176793 11178909 l"m entitled to see my own child.
11179113 11182662 You control yourself.<br />You"ll be seeing it for a long time.
11183273 11185946 l"d like to apologize<br />about its not being a boy.
11186193 11188149 Hush your mouth. Who wants a boy?
11188393 11191271 Boys aren"t any use.<br />Don"t you think l"m proof of that?
11192113 11193865 Have a drink of sherry.
11194073 11196303 Mammy, she is beautiful, isn"t she?
11196553 11198544 She sure is.
11198793 11200306 You ever see a prettier one?
11200513 11204711 Miss Scarlett was mighty near that<br />pretty when she come, but not quite.
11204953 11206306 Have another glass.
11210513 11212310 What"s that rustling noise I hear?
11212553 11216432 Lordy, that ain"t nothing but my<br />red silk petticoat you done give me.
11216633 11220546 Nothing but your petticoat? I don"t<br />believe it. Pull up your skirt.
11221353 11223708 Mr. Rhett, you is bad.
11223913 11225904 Yea, Lordy!
11230713 11233432 You sure took a long enough time<br />about wearing it.
11233753 11235903 Yes, sir. Too long.
11236113 11238024 No more mule in horse"s harness?
11238273 11241151 Miss Scarlett was bad<br />telling you about that.
11241393 11243907 You ain"t holding that<br />against Mammy, is you?
11244313 11245746 I don"t hold it against you.
11245993 11248109 I just wanted to know.<br />Have another glass.
11248313 11249712 Take the whole bottle.
11249913 11252905 Dr. Meade says you can go in now,<br />Captain Butler.
11255993 11257949 This sure is a happy day to me.
11258193 11261105 I done diapered three generations<br />of this family"s girls.
11261313 11263144 And it sure is a happy day.
11263393 11268103 Oh, yes, Mammy. The happiest days are<br />when babies come. I wish...
11268473 11271510 She"s beautiful. What do you<br />suppose they"ll name her?
11271753 11273744 Miss Scarlett told me<br />if it was a girl...
11273993 11277702 ...she was going to name it<br />Eugenia Victoria.
11278953 11281342 She"s a beautiful baby.
11281593 11283982 The most beautiful baby ever.
11287553 11290147 Do you know that this is<br />your birthday?
11290393 11292748 That you"re a week old today?
11293033 11296628 Yes, l"m going to buy her a pony,<br />the likes of which...
11296833 11298505 ...this town has never seen.
11298753 11302109 Yes, l"m going to send her to<br />the best schools in Charleston.
11302353 11306710 Yes, and her will be received by<br />the best families in the South.
11306913 11309108 And when it comes time<br />for her to marry...
11309353 11312743 ...well, she"ll be a little princess.
11312993 11314949 Certainly making a fool of yourself.
11315193 11316308 Why shouldn"t I?
11317393 11321102 She"s the first person who"s ever<br />completely belonged to me.
11321553 11323032 Great balls of fire!
11323273 11325025 I had the baby, didn"t I?
11325593 11327982 - It"s Melanie. May I come in?<br />- Come in.
11328273 11332505 Yes, come in and look at<br />my daughter"s beautiful blue eyes.
11333793 11336261 Most babies have blue eyes<br />when they"re born.
11336553 11339226 Don"t tell him anything.<br />He knows everything about babies.
11339433 11342425 Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br />and they"ll stay blue.
11342673 11345107 As blue as the Bonnie Blue flag.
11345473 11347384 That"s it.<br />That"s what we"ll call her.
11347873 11349704 Bonnie Blue Butler.
11357393 11359111 Try again, Mammy.
11366313 11367541 Twenty inches.
11367793 11371103 Twenty inches. L"ve grown as big<br />as Aunt Pitty.
11371313 11373543 You simply gotta make it 181/2 again.
11373793 11375112 You done had a baby.
11375353 11378026 And you ain"t never gonna be<br />no 181/2 inches again.
11378273 11380104 There ain"t nothing to do about it.
11381153 11382950 There is something to do about it.
11383193 11386310 l"m just not going to get old and fat<br />before my time.
11386793 11389102 I just won"t have any more babies.
11389593 11392949 I heard Mr. Rhett say that he"d be<br />wanting a son next year.
11393193 11395753 Tell Captain Butler I decided<br />not to go out.
11395993 11397711 l"ll have supper in my room.
11417473 11419111 I got your message.
11419313 11421907 l"ll have them bring<br />my supper up here too.
11427673 11429311 No objections to that, I hope?
11429513 11430707 No.
11431793 11432908 Yes.
11434753 11437506 I mean, I don"t care<br />where you have your supper.
11442393 11443712 You see...
11443913 11446029 Well, l"ve decided...
11447673 11450426 Well, I hope I don"t have<br />any more children.
11462153 11465543 My pet, as I told you<br />before Bonnie was born...
11465793 11468546 ...it"s immaterial to me<br />whether you have one child or 20.
11468793 11470511 No, but you know what I...
11470953 11472306 Do you know what I mean?
11472553 11476307 I do. And do you know I can<br />divorce you for this?
11476793 11478704 You"re low enough to think of that.
11478953 11481342 If you had any chivalry in you,<br />or were nice...
11481593 11485711 Look at Ashley Wilkes. Melanie can"t<br />have any more children and he...
11487273 11489707 You"ve been to the lumber office<br />this afternoon.
11489953 11491705 What has that got to do with it?
11493073 11496304 Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br />Pray, go on, Mrs. Butler.
11496553 11499306 It"s no use. You wouldn"t understand.
11499793 11501704 You know, l"m sorry for you.
11501953 11502829 Sorry for me?
11503073 11506509 Sorry for you because you throw away<br />happiness with both hands...
11506713 11508749 ...and reach out for unhappiness.
11508993 11510346 I don"t know<br />what you mean.
11510633 11514751 If you were free and Melly were dead<br />and you had your precious Ashley...
11514993 11516904 ...do you think you"d be happy?
11517473 11520909 You"d never know him,<br />never even understand his mind...
11521153 11523872 ...any more than you understand<br />anything, except money.
11524353 11525911 Never mind about that. I want...
11526153 11530112 You may keep your sanctity.<br />It"ll work no hardship on me.
11530353 11531547 You don"t care?
11531913 11534029 The world is full<br />of many things and people...
11534273 11537709 ...and I shan"t be lonely.<br />I will find comfort elsewhere.
11537953 11539102 Well, that"s fine.
11539313 11542749 But I warn you, in case you change<br />your mind, I intend to lock my door.
11542953 11544022 Why bother?
11544273 11547310 If I wanted to come in,<br />no lock could keep me out.
11564113 11565751 I knew most women were cheats...
11565993 11568143 ...hypocritical and hard,<br />but this one...
11568393 11570543 - It ain"t no use.<br />- What do you mean?
11570793 11572545 I mean you"re poisoned with her.
11572793 11576103 I don"t care what she"s done to you.<br />You"re still in love with her.
11576353 11580505 - It pleasures me none to say it.<br />- Maybe so, but l"m through with her.
11580753 11584507 You"ve gotta think of the child.<br />Child"s worth 10 of the mother.
11590313 11591951 You"re a shrewd woman, Belle.
11592153 11593905 And a very nice one.
11595033 11595829 Yes, Rhett?
11596033 11599309 I was just thinking of the difference<br />between you and...
11599513 11602186 You"re both hardheaded businesswomen,<br />and successful.
11602873 11604909 But you"ve got a heart, Belle.
11606393 11608111 And you"re honest.
11610473 11611383 Goodbye, Rhett.
11612873 11614101 Goodbye, Belle.
11629113 11633425 She"ll be a wonderful horsewoman.<br />Look at those hands. And that seat!
11633673 11634947 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
11635193 11637707 Why we have to wheel a baby<br />when we have servants...
11637913 11640746 - Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.<br />- Good morning, Captain Butler.
11640953 11641908 Good morning, Scarlett.
11642113 11644752 Making fools of ourselves<br />in front of these buffaloes.
11644993 11647427 If you"d thought of your position,<br />you wouldn"t have to.
11647673 11652508 But as it is, we"re going to cultivate<br />every female dragon of the Old Guard...
11652713 11655705 - Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.<br />- Good morning, Captain Butler.
11655953 11657830 Good morning, Scarlett.
11658073 11661110 So the millionaire speculator is<br />turning respectable.
11661313 11663304 Money can"t buy<br />what I want for Bonnie.
11663553 11665544 l"ll admit l"ve been at fault too.
11665793 11667829 Bonnie will have a place<br />among decent people.
11668073 11672112 Even if we both have to crawl<br />on our bellies to every fat old cat...
11672393 11674111 Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
11674313 11677703 Good morning, Captain Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
11682913 11685746 Mrs. Merriwether, I have<br />great regard for your knowledge.
11685993 11688427 - Could you give me some advice?<br />- Certainly.
11688633 11690749 Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br />I can"t stop her.
11690993 11694463 You should make her stop!<br />lt"ll ruin the shape of her mouth.
11694673 11696345 She has such a beautiful mouth.
11696593 11699027 - I tried putting soap on her nails.<br />- Soap?
11699233 11702623 Put quinine on her thumb and<br />she"ll stop sucking it quick enough.
11702833 11705347 Quinine! I never would have<br />thought of it.
11705593 11707424 I can"t thank you enough.
11707673 11710062 You"ve taken a great load off my mind.
11710273 11711501 Good morning.
11714193 11717026 Good morning, Dolly.<br />Wasn"t that Captain Butler?
11717273 11719833 Good morning, Caroline.<br />I was just thinking...
11720073 11723907 ...there"s a great deal of good in<br />a man who would love a child so much.
11724113 11726024 But of course there is.
11726273 11730312 Fanny Elsing told Dr. Meade that<br />Captain Butler finally admitted...
11730513 11734142 ...that he was honored for his<br />services at the Battle of Franklin.
11734393 11736748 Did I tell you<br />that Captain Butler made...
11736993 11741111 ...a stupendous contribution to the<br />Association for the Beautification...
11741313 11743508 ...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
11744593 11748142 My grandbaby, Napoleon Picard, is<br />giving a party for Bonnie next week.
11748393 11752352 Why, Dolly Merriwether, it was<br />my idea to give a party for Bonnie.
11752593 11756108 Why, Caroline Meade, how can you say<br />a thing like that?
11762593 11765903 Watch Daddy put your pony over it,<br />Bonnie. Now, watch!
11768553 11770623 Daddy, let me! Let me!
11770833 11772027 All right, darling.
11772273 11773911 Put her on, Pork.
11776713 11777828 Up we go!
11778073 11779108 Oh, there!
11779713 11781988 Lordy mercy!<br />There he goes again.
11782193 11785105 Grip tightly with your legs.<br />Lean forward and go with him.
11785313 11788111 Hold your reins properly<br />in a firm hand. Up!
11789153 11791348 That was fine. I knew you"d do it.
11791593 11794107 When you"re older, we"ll go<br />to Kentucky and Virginia.
11794353 11798312 You"ll be the best horsewoman in the<br />South. Give your daddy a kiss.
11803153 11805383 Did you see her?<br />Wasn"t she wonderful?
11805633 11808022 Mr. Rhett, I done told you<br />and told you...
11808273 11812027 ...it ain"t fittin" for a girl to ride<br />astraddle with her dress flying up.
11812593 11814709 All right. L"ll teach her<br />to ride sidesaddle.
11814913 11817825 l"ll buy her a blue velvet<br />riding habit. She"ll love that.
11818113 11820308 A nice black broadcloth<br />is what girls wear.
11820553 11822703 Now, Mammy, be reasonable.
11822913 11825711 Well, I don"t think<br />it"s fittin", but...
11827033 11829501 It ain"t fittin",<br />it just ain"t fittin".
11830753 11832311 It ain"t fittin".
11841753 11845507 Why, Scarlett, what are you doing<br />downtown at this time of day?
11845753 11846549 Well, I just...
11846753 11849904 Why aren"t you helping Melly<br />with my surprise birthday party?
11850153 11853509 Why, you aren"t supposed to<br />know anything about that.
11853753 11856313 Melly"d be disappointed<br />if you weren"t surprised.
11856553 11857702 I won"t let on.
11857913 11860302 l"ll be the most surprised man<br />in Atlanta.
11860553 11862509 Let me show you the books...
11862713 11865227 ...so you can see how bad<br />a businessman I am.
11865473 11868943 Don"t let"s fool with any books today.<br />When l"m wearing a new bonnet...
11869193 11871991 ...all the figures I ever knew go<br />right out of my head.
11872193 11875344 Figures are well lost when<br />the bonnet"s as pretty as that.
11875593 11879142 Scarlett, you know,<br />you get prettier all the time.
11879393 11883352 You haven"t changed a bit since<br />our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
11883593 11886903 ...where you sat under a tree<br />surrounded by dozens of beaus.
11888393 11890702 That girl doesn"t exist anymore.
11891313 11895101 Nothing"s turned out as I expected,<br />Ashley. Nothing.
11895753 11899712 Yes, we"ve traveled a long road<br />since the old days, haven"t we?
11899913 11901471 The lazy days...
11901753 11904506 ...the warm, still,<br />country twilight...
11904993 11907951 ...the high, soft Negro laughter<br />from the quarters...
11908753 11912792 ...the golden warmth and security<br />of those days.
11914073 11915904 Don"t look back, Ashley.
11916113 11917910 Don"t look back.
11919193 11921502 It drags at your heart till...
11921793 11924023 ...you can"t do anything<br />but look back.
11928673 11930903 I didn"t mean to make you sad,<br />my dear.
11931873 11935502 I never want you to be anything<br />but completely happy.
11957793 11958703 Who is it?
11958913 11960505 Only your husband.
11961113 11962512 Come in.
11963073 11966304 Am I actually being invited<br />into the sanctuary?
11967113 11969104 You"re not ready for Melanie"s party.
11969313 11970541 l"ve got a headache.
11970793 11974103 You go without me<br />and make my excuses to Melanie.
11975113 11977752 What a white-livered<br />little coward you are!
11977993 11980826 You"re going to that party<br />and you"ll have to hurry.
11981073 11982552 - Has India dared...?<br />- India has.
11982793 11985944 - Everyone in town knows the story.<br />- Kill them for spreading lies.
11986193 11988707 I don"t kill<br />people who tell the truth.
11988913 11989948 No time to argue.
11990193 11993310 I won"t go! I can"t go until<br />this misunderstanding clears up.
11993553 11997023 You won"t cheat Melly out of publicly<br />ordering you out of her house.
11997273 12000709 There was nothing wrong.<br />India hates me so. I can"t go.
12000913 12004223 If you don"t show your face tonight,<br />you"ll never be able to again.
12004473 12006907 I don"t care,<br />but you won"t ruin Bonnie"s chances.
12007153 12009906 You"re going to that party,<br />for her sake. Get dressed.
12023353 12026902 Wear that. Nothing modest or matronly<br />will do for this occasion.
12027113 12030901 And put on plenty of rouge.<br />I want you to look your part tonight.
12037033 12039501 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
12039753 12041823 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
12042073 12044906 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
12045113 12047149 <i>Which noBody can deny</i>
12047393 12049509 <i>Which noBody can deny</i>
12049753 12051744 <i>Which noBody can deny</i>
12055793 12057943 - Good night, Scarlett.<br />- But, Rhett...
12058193 12060946 You"re going into the arena alone.<br />The lions are hungry.
12061193 12062626 Don"t leave me. Don"t.
12062873 12064511 You"re not afraid?
12089593 12091709 What a lovely dress, darling.
12091953 12094547 India wasn"t able to come.<br />Will you be an angel?
12094793 12098547 I do need you to help me<br />receive my guests.
12100873 12102306 Mrs. Meade...
12102593 12104709 ...here"s our darling Scarlett.
12105993 12108063 - Good evening.<br />- Good evening.
12108393 12110429 - Why, Scarlett.<br />- Good evening.
12113593 12117302 Ashley, aren"t you going to get<br />our Scarlett a glass of punch?
12124233 12126952 Did you have a good time<br />at Miss Melly"s party?
12127193 12129753 Yes. Now, Mammy,<br />be sure and leave word.
12129993 12133702 If Captain Butler asks for me<br />when he comes back, l"m asleep.
12162593 12164709 Come in, Mrs. Butler.
12172953 12174306 Come here.
12189153 12190506 Sit down.
12192873 12196229 No reason you shouldn"t<br />have a nightcap, even if I am here.
12196473 12198304 I didn"t want a drink.<br />I heard a noise...
12198553 12200544 You heard nothing of the kind.
12200793 12203307 You wouldn"t have come<br />if you thought I was here.
12203553 12205544 - You must need a drink badly.<br />- I do not.
12205753 12208313 Take it. Don"t give yourself airs.
12208553 12211704 I know you drink on the quiet,<br />and I know how much you drink.
12211913 12214711 Do you think I care if you like<br />your brandy?
12220993 12223746 - You"re drunk and l"m going to bed.<br />- L"m very drunk...
12223993 12227542 ...and I intend getting still drunker<br />before the evening"s over.
12227793 12229545 But you"re not going to bed.
12229793 12231306 Not yet.
12231593 12232912 Sit down.
12235793 12238512 So she stood by you, did she?
12238793 12242581 How"s it feel to have the woman<br />you"ve wronged cloak your sins?
12243913 12246746 You"re wondering if she knows<br />all about you and Ashley.
12246993 12249871 You"re wondering if she did it<br />just to save face.
12250073 12253509 You"re thinking she"s a fool for<br />doing it, even if it saved your hide...
12253753 12256267 - I will not listen.<br />- Yes, you"ll listen.
12256753 12259711 Miss Melly"s a fool,<br />but not the kind you think.
12259953 12264868 She has too much honor to conceive<br />of dishonor in anyone she loves.
12265153 12267109 And she loves you.
12267353 12270186 Though just why she does,<br />l"m sure I don"t know.
12271193 12274549 If you weren"t so drunk and insulting,<br />I could explain everything.
12274793 12278103 - As it is, though...<br />- You get out of that chair once more...
12281753 12286668 Of course, the comic figure in all<br />this is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
12287193 12290503 Mr. Wilkes, who can"t be<br />mentally faithful to his wife...
12290713 12293511 ...and won"t be unfaithful to her<br />technically.
12294393 12297510 - Why doesn"t he make up his mind?<br />- Rhett, you...
12300393 12302987 Observe my hands, my dear.
12303673 12306312 I could tear you to pieces with them.
12306673 12310586 And l"d do it if it"d take<br />Ashley out of your mind forever.
12311113 12312512 But it wouldn"t.
12313353 12317585 So l"ll remove him<br />from your mind forever, this way.
12318193 12320502 l"ll put my hands so.
12320913 12323711 One on each side of your head.
12323993 12328350 And l"ll smash your skull<br />between them like a walnut.
12328593 12330709 And that"ll block him out.
12331993 12335110 Take your hands off me,<br />you drunken fool!
12339713 12343103 You know, l"ve always admired<br />your spirit, my dear.
12343673 12346346 Never more than now,<br />when you"re cornered.
12346993 12348108 l"m not cornered.
12348353 12350913 You"ll never corner me or frighten me.
12351153 12354350 You"ve lived in dirt so long,<br />you can"t understand anything else.
12354593 12357505 You"re jealous of something<br />you can"t understand.
12357753 12358902 Good night.
12360593 12361912 Jealous, am I?
12362113 12364183 Yes, I suppose I am.
12364473 12367624 Even though I know you"ve been<br />faithful to me all along.
12367873 12368942 How do I know?
12369193 12372503 Because I know Ashley Wilkes<br />and his honorable breed.
12372713 12374305 They"re gentlemen.
12374513 12377744 That"s more than I can say<br />for you or for me.
12377993 12381986 We"re not gentlemen.<br />And we have no honor, have we?
12390593 12392709 It"s not that easy, Scarlett.
12396673 12400427 You turn me out while you chase<br />Ashley, while you dream of Ashley.
12400673 12403312 This is one night<br />you"re not turning me out.
12429913 12431824 How are you feeling this morning?
12432073 12434712 Well, this misery in my back...
12434913 12436505 ...ain"t so good.
12438753 12440948 You act mighty happy this morning.
12441193 12443309 I am, Mammy. I am.
12449393 12454308 <i>Oh, she wept with delight</i><br /><i>When he gave her a smile</i>
12454593 12459269 <i>And tremBled with fear at his frown</i>
12475153 12476506 Hello.
12478913 12482030 l"d like to extend my apology<br />for my conduct of last night.
12482593 12483708 Oh, but, Rhett.
12484193 12486229 I was very drunk...
12486513 12488981 ...and quite swept off my feet<br />by your charms.
12491073 12494270 You needn"t bother to apologize.<br />Nothing you do surprises me.
12494793 12498832 l"ve been thinking, and I believe<br />it would be better for both of us...
12499073 12501746 ...if we admitted we made a mistake<br />and got a divorce.
12501993 12503312 - A divorce?<br />- Yes.
12503553 12505908 There"s no point in holding on<br />to each other.
12506153 12508383 l"ll provide for you.<br />You"ve plenty of grounds.
12508633 12511147 Just give me Bonnie,<br />and you can say what you please.
12511393 12515511 Thank you, but I wouldn"t dream of<br />disgracing the family with a divorce.
12516113 12518422 You"d disgrace it<br />if Ashley were free.
12518673 12521824 Makes my head spin to think<br />how quickly you"d divorce me.
12522473 12523269 Wouldn"t you?
12525273 12526911 Answer me. Wouldn"t you?
12527553 12529430 Please go now and leave me alone.
12531153 12533223 l"m going. That"s what I came<br />to tell you.
12534313 12536622 l"m going on a very extended trip<br />to London.
12536873 12538545 And l"m leaving today.
12538873 12542752 l"m taking Bonnie with me.<br />Please get her duds packed right away.
12542993 12545302 You"ll never take my child<br />out of this house.
12545513 12549142 She"s my child too. You"re mistaken<br />if you think l"m leaving her here...
12549393 12551907 ...with a mother who doesn"t<br />consider her reputation.
12552153 12553745 You"re a fine one to talk.
12553953 12558185 You think l"ll let her out when you"ll<br />have her around people like Belle?
12559073 12561507 If you were a man,<br />l"d break your neck for that.
12561713 12563669 l"ll thank you to shut your mouth.
12563873 12566433 As for you giving yourself<br />airs about motherhood...
12566673 12568629 ...a cat"s a better mother<br />than you are.
12568873 12571626 Have her things packed for me<br />in an hour, or I warn you...
12571873 12575502 ...l"ve always thought a lashing with<br />a whip would benefit you immensely.
12580833 12582061 Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
12582993 12585223 - Hello, Uncle Rhett.<br />- Hello, Beau.
12585473 12590308 Daddy, where have you been?<br />l"ve been waiting for you all morning.
12590553 12594023 l"ve been hunting for a rabbit skin<br />to wrap my little Bonnie in.
12594273 12596104 Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
12599193 12602742 l"m going to take you<br />on a long trip to fairyland.
12603153 12604825 Where? Where?
12605073 12608304 l"ll show you the Tower of London,<br />where the little princes were...
12608553 12610305 ...and London Bridge.
12610513 12613983 London Bridge?<br />Will it be falling down?
12615073 12617587 Well, it will<br />if you want it to, darling.
12619793 12622910 Daddy, dark!
12623153 12624586 Dark!
12627713 12630910 It"s all right, Bonnie.<br />Who put out that light? Nurse!
12636193 12638024 What"s the matter with my Bonnie?
12638273 12639752 A bear!
12639993 12642143 A bear? A big bear?
12642393 12643621 Dreadful big!
12643833 12645824 And he sat on my chest!
12646073 12649304 l"ll stay here and shoot him<br />if he comes back.
12662993 12665109 Good evening, Mr. Butler.
12667673 12670312 I told you never to leave<br />this child alone in the dark.
12670513 12673983 Children are often afraid of the dark,<br />but they get over it.
12674193 12675751 Let her scream for a night...
12675993 12677108 Let her scream?
12677313 12679543 Either you"re a fool<br />or an inhuman woman.
12679793 12682148 If you want her<br />to grow up cowardly...
12682393 12685624 Cowardly? There isn"t<br />a cowardly bone in her body.
12685873 12687431 You"re discharged.
12687673 12689311 As you say, sir.
12705113 12706546 Where"s Mother?
12712833 12714744 Aren"t you happy here<br />in London with me?
12715473 12718385 I wanna go home.
12729593 12733188 Miss Bonnie! And Captain Butler!
12734073 12735062 Hello, Mammy!
12735313 12737031 Honey child!
12737873 12742503 Miss Scarlett, they"s back.<br />They"s back!
12742713 12744669 Bonnie! Bonnie, baby.
12744913 12747347 Darling baby!<br />You glad to be home?
12747593 12749424 Daddy gave me a kitten.
12749633 12753387 But London"s a horrid place.
12753593 12756630 Where"s my pony?<br />I wanna go out and see my pony.
12756833 12758949 You go out and see your pony.
12767313 12769224 Where"s my pony?
12769873 12771750 I want to go out and see my pony.
12772273 12773865 You run along with Mammy.
12774113 12778425 Come on, honey child.<br />Mammy sure missed you, honey.
12779513 12781629 Mrs. Butler, I believe.
12781993 12784223 Mammy said you"d come back.
12784553 12785781 Only to bring Bonnie.
12786233 12790021 Apparently any mother,<br />even a bad one, is better than none.
12790233 12791746 You"re going away again?
12792313 12794827 What perception, Mrs. Butler.<br />Right away.
12795313 12797827 In fact, I left my bags<br />at the station.
12799313 12802271 You"re looking pale.<br />Is there a shortage of rouge?
12802513 12805471 Or can this wanness mean<br />you"ve been missing me?
12805713 12807066 If l"m pale, it"s your fault.
12807313 12810430 Not because l"ve been<br />missing you, but because...
12813793 12816023 Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
12816513 12819152 It"s because l"m going to have a baby.
12824393 12827430 Indeed. And who"s the happy father?
12828273 12831345 You know it"s yours.<br />I don"t want it any more than you do.
12831593 12834232 No woman would want the child<br />of a cad like you.
12834433 12837027 I wish it were anybody"s<br />child but yours!
12838233 12841031 Well, cheer up.<br />Maybe you"ll have an accident.
12854633 12856225 Is she better?
12859993 12861142 Has she asked for me?
12861393 12864226 Don"t you understand?<br />She"s delirious.
12865033 12867547 Rhett...
12867793 12869670 I want Rhett!
12873433 12876630 What"s the matter, honey?<br />Did you call somebody, child?
12876873 12881230 It"s no use. It"s no use!
12901833 12903824 Dr. Meade"s left.
12904313 12907623 - Scarlett"s dead.<br />- Oh, no, she"s much better.
12907833 12909630 Really she is.
12925273 12928026 There, there, Captain Butler,<br />you"re beside yourself.
12928233 12931066 She"ll very soon be well again.<br />I promise you.
12931273 12933264 She never wanted this baby.
12933473 12936033 Not want a baby?<br />Why, every woman wants a baby.
12936233 12938827 You do, but she doesn"t.<br />Not my children.
12939033 12940910 She told me she didn"t want any more.
12941113 12944264 I wanted to hurt her because<br />she"d hurt me. And I did.
12944513 12947471 You mustn"t tell me these things.<br />It"s not fair to...
12947713 12950273 I didn"t know about this baby<br />until she fell.
12950513 12953107 If l"d only known,<br />l"d have come straight home.
12953313 12955144 Well, of course you would.
12955393 12958669 And then when she told me<br />there on the steps, what did I do?
12958993 12961427 What did I say?<br />I laughed and I said...
12961633 12964431 But you didn"t mean it.<br />I know you didn"t mean it.
12964633 12967431 But I did mean it.<br />I was crazy with jealousy.
12967633 12971421 She"s never cared for me. I tried<br />to make her care, but I couldn"t.
12972913 12974187 You"re so wrong.
12974393 12978625 Scarlett loves you a great deal.<br />Much more than she knows.
12979193 12982981 If that were true, l"d wait forever.<br />If she"d only forgive me.
12983193 12987027 She will. You must be patient.
12988393 12993308 No, it"s not possible. If you<br />only knew who she really loved...
12994393 12996031 You wouldn"t believe it.
12998833 13001142 Surely you haven"t<br />listened to idle gossip.
13001393 13004829 No, Captain Butler.<br />I wouldn"t believe it.
13005713 13010229 There, there. Scarlett"s going to get<br />well, and there can be other babies.
13011073 13013633 She couldn"t even if she wanted to.
13013873 13017343 But of course she could!<br />l"m going to.
13020513 13023664 No, Miss Melly, you mustn"t risk it.<br />It"s too dangerous.
13023913 13026746 Children are life renewing itself,<br />Captain Butler.
13026993 13031623 And when life does that,<br />danger seems very unimportant.
13033313 13036828 l"ve never before known anyone<br />who was really brave.
13037073 13039871 I pray God things go well<br />with you, Miss Melly.
13040113 13044231 And I want to thank you for all<br />you"ve done for me and for Scarlett.
13044913 13047029 From my heart, I thank you.
13053193 13056390 Miss Scarlett"s feeling<br />a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
13056593 13058026 Thank you, Mammy.
13064833 13066824 l"ve come to ask your forgiveness...
13067033 13069547 ...hoping our life together<br />has another chance.
13069793 13073627 Our life together? When did we<br />ever have a life together?
13074833 13076551 Yes, you"re right.
13076793 13080468 But l"m sure if we could only try<br />again, we could be happy.
13080713 13082510 What is there to make<br />us happy now?
13083833 13086631 Well, there"s Bonnie...
13087033 13088751 ...and I love you, Scarlett.
13089113 13090671 When did you discover that?
13090913 13094826 l"ve always loved you, but you"ve<br />never given me a chance to show it.
13096633 13098828 And just what do you want me to do?
13099873 13103627 To begin with, give up the mill,<br />Scarlett. We"ll go away.
13103873 13105864 We"ll take Bonnie<br />and have another honeymoon.
13106113 13108673 Give up the mill?<br />lt"s making more money than ever.
13108913 13111302 I know, but we don"t need it.<br />Sell it.
13111833 13115143 Or give it to Ashley.<br />Melanie"s been such a friend to us.
13115393 13117827 Melanie!<br />If you"d only think more about me!
13118113 13119990 I am thinking of you.
13120513 13122265 And l"m thinking that...
13123673 13126585 ...maybe the mill"s taking you<br />away from me and Bonnie.
13127313 13129827 I know what you"re thinking.<br />Don"t bring Bonnie into it.
13130033 13132672 - You"re taking her away from me.<br />- But she loves you.
13132913 13136428 You"ve made her love you and not me.<br />She"s so spoiled now, that...
13136633 13139431 Mommy, Daddy! Watch me.
13139673 13140947 We"re watching, darling.
13141473 13143065 You"re mighty pretty, precious.
13143313 13144746 So are you.
13144993 13147791 l"m going to jump.<br />Watch me, Daddy.
13148033 13150627 I don"t think you ought<br />to do much jumping yet.
13150833 13152789 You just learned<br />to ride sidesaddle.
13153233 13154427 I will so jump.
13154633 13157272 I can jump better than ever,<br />because l"ve grown.
13157513 13158832 I moved the bar higher.
13159073 13160552 Don"t let her do it.
13160793 13162431 No, Bonnie, you can"t.
13162633 13164669 If you fall off,<br />don"t cry and blame me!
13165633 13168431 Rhett, stop her.
13173113 13175024 She"s just like Pa.
13177913 13179824 Just like Pa...!
13208313 13211828 Lordy, Miss Melly.<br />I sure is glad you"s come.
13213793 13216261 This house won"t seem<br />the same without Bonnie.
13216513 13218344 How"s Miss Scarlett bearing up?
13218593 13221551 Miss Melly, this here"s<br />done broke her heart.
13221793 13224068 I didn"t fetch you<br />on Miss Scarlett"s account.
13224313 13229228 What that child got to stand, the<br />good Lord give her strength to stand.
13229713 13232432 It"s Mr. Rhett l"s worried about.
13235313 13237873 He done lost his mind<br />these last couple of days.
13239713 13244070 I ain"t never seen no man, black or<br />white, set such store on any child.
13244273 13246468 When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...
13246673 13250871 ...Mr. Rhett grabbed his gun and run<br />out and shoot that poor pony.
13251113 13254230 And for a minute,<br />I think he gonna shoot hisself.
13254473 13255952 Oh, poor Captain Butler.
13256193 13260630 Miss Scarlett called him a murderer<br />for teaching that child to jump.
13260833 13263552 She said, You give me my baby<br />what you killed.
13263793 13267752 And then he say Miss Scarlett ain"t<br />never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
13267993 13271668 It like to turn my blood cold,<br />the things they say to one another.
13271913 13274632 Stop, Mammy, don"t tell me any more.
13277073 13278825 And then that night...
13279873 13283388 ...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br />in the nursery with Miss Bonnie.
13284473 13287749 He wouldn"t open the door when<br />Miss Scarlett beat on it and hollered.
13287993 13291030 And that"s where he"s been<br />for two whole days.
13292513 13296062 This evening, Miss Scarlett shouted<br />through the door and said...
13296313 13297985 ...The funeral"s set for tomorrow.
13298193 13300753 He says, You try that,<br />and I kills you tomorrow.
13301113 13303707 Do you think l"s gonna<br />put my child...
13303913 13307189 ...in the dark when she"s so<br />scared of it?
13307393 13310430 - He has lost his mind!<br />- Yes"m, that"s the God"s truth.
13310673 13314427 He ain"t gonna let us bury that<br />child. You gotta help us.
13314633 13316066 But I can"t intrude.
13316313 13318031 If you can"t help us, who can?
13318273 13321629 Mr. Rhett always set great store<br />by your opinion.
13323313 13325224 Please, Miss Melly.
13326073 13329031 l"ll do what I can, Mammy.
13334633 13336669 Get away from that door<br />and leave us alone.
13336913 13338824 It"s Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.
13339073 13342622 Please let me in.<br />l"ve come to see Bonnie.
13362793 13367309 Oh, Lord, please help Mr. Rhett<br />in this hour of his grief.
13378833 13381825 I want you to make a good deal<br />of strong coffee...
13382033 13386424 ...and bring it up to Captain Butler.<br />l"ll go and see Miss Scarlett.
13387113 13391425 Captain Butler"s willing for the funeral<br />to take place tomorrow morning.
13391673 13396224 Hallelujah! I expect the angels<br />fights on your side, Miss Melly.
13404033 13407912 Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy.<br />And try...
13408113 13410024 ...try to get me home.
13420113 13422229 Where is my mother going away to?
13422473 13425624 And why can"t I go along, please?
13425833 13430031 We can"t always go along, Beau,<br />as much as we may want to.
13430673 13432664 You"re going back to bed now.
13433513 13436869 She can"t be dying. She can"t be.
13437113 13439832 She hasn"t your strength.<br />She"s never had any.
13440073 13443429 - She"s never had anything but heart.<br />- You knew that too?
13443673 13446471 Why do I have to go back to bed?<br />lt"s morning.
13447113 13448705 It isn"t really morning yet.
13454993 13456472 You may come in now, Scarlett.
13456713 13460262 Dr. Meade, please let me see her.<br />l"ve been waiting here two days.
13460513 13463425 l"ve got to tell her<br />that I was wrong about something.
13463633 13467023 She knows you were wrong.<br />She wants to see Scarlett.
13470033 13473150 Miss Melly"s going to die in peace.<br />Don"t ease your conscience...
13473393 13477432 ...telling her things that make no<br />difference now. You understand?
13491033 13492830 It"s me, Melly.
13493993 13495745 Promise me?
13495993 13497426 Anything.
13498113 13500547 Look after my little son.
13501313 13505591 I gave him to you<br />once before. Remember?
13506673 13508265 The day he was born.
13508513 13512347 Please, Melly, don"t talk this way.<br />I know you"ll get well.
13512593 13515232 Promise me... college.
13515433 13519426 Yes, and Europe, and a pony.<br />Whatever he wants, but...
13520593 13521946 ...oh, Melly, do try.
13522193 13524024 Ashley...
13525033 13526625 Ashley and you...
13528833 13531905 What about Ashley, Melly?
13532713 13535511 Look after him for me...
13535713 13539501 ...just as you looked after me...
13540673 13541788 ...for him.
13543633 13545225 I will, Melly.
13546073 13548029 Look after him...
13548473 13552227 ...but never let him know.
13560913 13562631 Good night.
13563713 13566068 Promise?
13566273 13568264 What else, Melly?
13568513 13570629 Captain Butler.
13571593 13574903 - Be kind to him.<br />- Rhett?
13575513 13578425 He loves you so.
13581393 13583224 Yes, Melly.
13585233 13587030 Goodbye.
13604313 13606429 You ladies may come in now.
13613673 13616824 I don"t know where<br />the mate to this is.
13617033 13619422 She must"ve put it away.
13620313 13624704 Stop it! Hold me. L"m so frightened!
13626313 13628622 l"m so frightened!
13632713 13636831 Scarlett, what can I do?<br />I can"t live without her. I can"t!
13637873 13641832 Everything I ever had<br />is going with her.
13644913 13647427 You really love her, don"t you?
13647633 13652548 She"s the only dream I ever had that<br />didn"t die in the face of reality.
13652913 13656064 Dreams. Always dreams with you.<br />Never common sense.
13656313 13659430 Scarlett, if you knew what<br />l"ve gone through!
13660033 13663867 Ashley, you should"ve told me years<br />ago that you loved her and not me.
13664113 13667025 And not left me dangling<br />with your talk of honor.
13667233 13670828 But you had to wait till now,<br />now when Melly"s dying...
13671033 13674230 ...to show me that I could never<br />mean any more to you...
13674473 13676828 ...than this Watling woman<br />does to Rhett.
13678713 13683423 And l"ve loved something<br />that doesn"t really exist.
13685513 13687026 But somehow...
13688033 13689625 ...I don"t care.
13690833 13692824 Somehow, it doesn"t matter.
13694513 13696822 It doesn"t matter one bit.
13700913 13702665 Ashley, forgive me.
13702913 13706269 Don"t cry. She mustn"t see<br />you"ve been crying.
13724673 13726425 Rhett, where are you?
13730233 13732224 Rhett, wait for me!
13736513 13738424 Rhett, wait for me!
13768273 13769626 Come in.
13778633 13781022 Melanie, she"s...?
13783713 13785226 Well, God rest her.
13785633 13788830 She was the only completely<br />kind person I ever knew.
13789273 13792822 A great lady. A very great lady.
13795113 13798822 So she"s dead. That makes it<br />nice for you, doesn"t it?
13799073 13803624 How can you say such a thing?<br />You know how I loved her, really.
13803873 13805864 No, I don"t know that I do.
13806113 13808673 It"s to your credit that<br />you could appreciate her.
13808913 13813225 Of course I appreciated her. She<br />thought of everybody except herself.
13813433 13817472 - Why, her last words were about you.<br />- What did she say?
13817713 13820864 She said, Be kind to Captain Butler...
13821113 13823024 ...he loves you so.
13827673 13830028 - Did she say anything else?<br />- She said...
13830793 13834024 She asked me to look after Ashley too.
13835313 13838623 It"s convenient to have the first<br />wife"s permission, isn"t it?
13840633 13842225 What do you mean?
13844513 13846071 What are you doing?
13846273 13847831 l"m leaving you, my dear.
13848033 13852823 All you need now is a divorce, and<br />your dreams of Ashley can come true.
13856913 13859108 No, you"re wrong.<br />Terribly wrong.
13859353 13860468 I don"t want a divorce.
13860713 13863625 When I knew tonight,<br />when I knew I loved you...
13863873 13866626 ...I ran home to tell you.<br />Oh, darling, darling!
13866873 13868226 Please don"t go on with this.
13868433 13871948 Leave us some dignity out<br />of our marriage. Spare us this last.
13872193 13876550 This last? Do listen to me! I must<br />have loved you for years, only...
13876793 13878624 ...I was such a fool,<br />I didn"t know it.
13878873 13883230 Please believe me. You must care.<br />Melly said you did.
13883473 13886510 I believe you.<br />And what about Ashley Wilkes?
13887073 13889428 I never really loved Ashley.
13889633 13893023 You certainly gave a good imitation<br />of it, up to this morning.
13894073 13896428 No, Scarlett. L"ve tried everything.
13896633 13899466 If you"d met me halfway, even<br />when I came back from London.
13899713 13903069 I was so glad to see you.<br />I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
13903313 13906066 Then when you were sick,<br />and it was all my fault.
13906313 13908873 I hoped that you"d call<br />for me. But you didn"t.
13909113 13911946 I wanted you. I wanted you<br />desperately...
13912153 13914269 ...but I didn"t think you wanted me.
13914513 13917232 It seems we"ve been<br />at cross purposes, doesn"t it?
13917473 13919225 But it"s no use now.
13919473 13922749 As long as there was Bonnie,<br />we had a chance to be happy.
13922993 13925951 I liked to think that Bonnie<br />was you, a little girl again.
13926193 13928832 Before the war and poverty<br />had done things to you.
13929073 13930665 She was so like you.
13930873 13933990 And I could pet her and spoil her,<br />as I wanted to spoil you.
13935593 13938232 But when she went, she took everything.
13939313 13942350 Rhett, please don"t say that.<br />l"m so sorry.
13942593 13945232 l"m so sorry for everything.
13945873 13948023 My darling, you"re such a child.
13948273 13953028 You think that by saying, l"m sorry,<br />all the past can be corrected.
13954713 13957022 Here, take my handkerchief.
13957233 13961431 Never, in any crisis of your life, have<br />I known you to have a handkerchief.
13966113 13967831 Rhett, where are you going?
13968033 13970467 l"m going to Charleston,<br />back where I belong.
13970713 13972829 Please take me with you.
13974073 13975791 l"m through with everything here.
13976313 13978622 I want peace.<br />I want to see if somewhere...
13978873 13982422 ...there isn"t something left<br />in life of charm and grace.
13982673 13984391 You know what l"m talking about?
13984593 13988347 - I only know that I love you!<br />- That"s your misfortune.
14002913 14006622 If you go, where shall I go?<br />What shall I do?
14006873 14009831 Frankly, my dear,<br />I don"t give a damn.
14022513 14025425 I can"t let him go. I can"t!
14025713 14028625 There must be some way<br />to bring him back.
14030873 14034627 I can"t think about this now.<br />l"ll go crazy if I do.
14035513 14037788 l"ll think about it tomorrow.
14051393 14054066 But I must think about it!
14054273 14056423 I must think about it.
14057113 14059229 What is there to do?
14060113 14062422 What is there that matters?
14064873 14068752 <i>You mean to tell me, Katie Scarlett, </i><br /><i>that Tara doesn 't mean anything? </i>
14068993 14073225 <i>Land's the only thing that matters. </i><br /><i>It's the only thing that lasts. </i>
14073473 14076943 <i>Something you love Better than me, </i><br /><i>though you may not know it. Tara. </i>
14077193 14080469 <i>It's where you get your</i><br /><i>strength, the red earth of Tara. </i>
14080713 14084228 <i>Land's the only thing that matters. </i><br /><i>It's the only thing that lasts. </i>
14084473 14087431 <i>Something you love Better than me, </i><br /><i>though you may not know it. </i>
14087673 14090233 <i>... from which you get</i><br /><i>your strength. Tara. </i>
14090433 14093345 <i>Land's the only thing that matters. </i>
14093553 14095430 <i>... the red earth of Tara. </i>
14099513 14101026 Tara!
14101993 14103426 Home.
14104273 14106025 l"ll go home.
14106633 14109511 And l"ll think of some way<br />to get him back.
14109713 14114628 After all, tomorrow is another day!
