410827 413057 What do we care if we were expelled<br />from college?
413129 416121 The war is gonna start any day.<br />We would've left college anyhow.
416199 417860 War! Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?
417934 419993 You know those fool Yankees<br />actually want a war?
420069 422264 - We'll show them.<br />- Fiddle-dee-dee!
422338 423532 War, war, war.
423639 426631 This war talk's spoiling all the fun<br />at every party this spring.
426709 429007 I get so bored I could scream.
429345 432542 - Besides, there isn't going to be any war.<br />- Not gonna be any war?
432615 435015 Why, honey, of course<br />there's going to be a war!
435084 439111 If either of you says "war" just once again,<br />I'll go in the house and slam the door.
439188 442282 - But, Scarlett, honey...<br />- Don't you want us to have a war?
448197 449323 Well...
450600 451828 but remember...
452301 453529 I warned you.
453870 455303 I've got an idea.
455371 457839 We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue<br />at Twelve Oaks.
457907 460637 That's a good idea.<br />Aren't you eating barbecue with us?
460710 463838 I hadn't thought about that yet.<br />I'll think about that tomorrow.
463913 465107 We want all your waltzes.
465181 467843 First Brent, then me, then Brent,<br />then me again, and so on.
467917 470477 - Promise?<br />- I'd just love to.
470853 474345 If only I didn't have<br />every one of them taken already.
474423 476152 Why, honey, you can't do that to us.
476225 478819 - How about if we tell you a secret?<br />- A secret? Who about?
478895 481022 You know Miss Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta?
481097 483497 Ashley Wilkes' cousin.<br />She's visiting the Wilkes...
483566 486501 That goody-goody!<br />Who wants to know a secret about her?
486569 488196 Anyway, we heard, that is, they say...
488271 492298 Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.<br />The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
492375 494070 Now do we get those waltzes?
494310 495641 Of course.
496546 500778 - The other boys will be hopping mad.<br />- Let them be mad. We can handle them!
501384 503614 It can't be true. Ashley loves me.
503686 504846 Scarlett!
505254 506881 What has gotten into her?
506956 508719 Do you suppose we made her mad?
508791 512625 Where are you going without your shawl,<br />and the night air fixing to set in?
512695 515357 How come you didn't ask them gentlemen<br />to stay for supper?
515431 517626 You ain't got no more manners<br />than a field hand...
517700 519895 after me and Miss Ellen done labored<br />with you.
519969 522369 Miss Scarlett, come on in the house!
522438 524736 Come on in before you catch<br />your death of dampness.
524807 527469 No! I'll wait for Pa to come home<br />from the Wilkes'.
527543 529135 Come on in here!
529712 531179 Come on!
546329 547660 Quitting time.
547730 549129 Who says it's quitting time?
549198 550358 I says it's quitting time.
550433 553834 I's the foreman. I's the one that says<br />when it's quitting time at Tara!
553903 555495 Quitting time!
555938 557872 Quitting time!
598814 602079 There's none in the county can touch you,<br />and none in the state.
603452 604476 Pa!
604787 607085 So proud of yourself you are.
609292 611157 Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara.
611227 614663 So you've been spying on me,<br />and like your sister Suellen...
614730 617164 you'll tell your mother on me<br />that I was jumping again.
617233 620396 You know I'm no tattletale like Suellen,<br />but it does seem to me...
620469 623461 after you broke your knee last year<br />jumping that same fence...
623539 627873 I'll not have me own daughter telling me<br />what I shall jump and not jump.
627943 629467 It's my own neck, so it is.
629612 633480 All right, Pa, you jump what you please.<br />How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?
633549 634573 The Wilkeses?
634650 638746 Just as you'd expect with the barbecue<br />tomorrow and talking nothing but war.
638821 641585 Oh, bother the war.<br />Was there anyone else there?
641657 645024 Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta, and her brother, Charles.
645094 646356 Melanie Hamilton!
646429 648761 She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny.<br />I hate her.
648831 650321 Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
650399 653425 Ashley Wilkes couldn't like<br />anyone like her.
653936 656370 What's your interest in Ashley<br />and Miss Melanie?
657640 659835 It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.
659909 663072 Has he been trifling with you?<br />Has he asked you to marry him?
663145 664578 - No!<br />- No, nor will he.
664647 667878 I have it in strictest confidence<br />from John Wilkes this afternoon...
667950 669645 Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.
669719 672279 It will be announced tomorrow night<br />at the ball.
672855 674345 I don't believe it.
674523 676650 Here! Here, where are you off to?
676892 677881 Scarlett!
678828 680659 What are you about?
681097 683861 Have you made a spectacle of yourself<br />running after a man...
683933 687164 who's not in love with you when<br />you might have any man in the county?
687236 690637 I haven't been running after him.<br />It's just a surprise, that's all.
690706 693539 Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.
693609 697101 If Ashley wanted to marry you,<br />it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes. "
697179 700671 I want my girl to be happy.<br />You'd not be happy with him.
700783 702011 I would, I would!
702084 704052 What difference does it make<br />who you marry...
704120 706588 so long as he's a Southerner<br />and thinks like you?
706655 708885 And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.
708958 711552 I don't want Tara.<br />Plantations don't mean anything when...
711627 716189 You mean to say, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,<br />that land doesn't mean anything to you?
716265 719132 Why, land is the only thing in the world<br />worth working for...
719201 723001 worth fighting for, worth dying for,<br />because it's the only thing that lasts.
723072 726599 - Oh, Pa, you talk like an Irishman.<br />- It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
726675 730236 And don't you be forgetting, missy,<br />that you're half Irish too.
730312 732712 And to anyone with a drop of Irish blood<br />in them...
732782 735012 why, the land they live on<br />is like their mother.
735084 739646 Oh, but you're just a child.<br />It'll come to you, this love of the land.
739722 742088 There's no getting away from it<br />if you're Irish.
767016 768040 Yonder she comes!
768117 770915 Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,<br />your ma's home!
770986 773887 Acting like a wet nurse<br />to them low-down, poor white trash...
773956 777448 instead of being here eating her supper.<br />Cookie, stir up the fire!
777526 780017 Miss Ellen's got no business<br />wearing herself out.
780563 783031 Take the lamp out on the porch.<br />Wearing herself out.
783098 785191 Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.
785267 787599 Wearing herself out<br />waiting on poor white trash.
787670 789763 Shut up, dog!<br />Barking in the house like that.
789839 792535 Get up from there, boy.<br />Don't you hear Miss Ellen's coming?
792608 794940 Get out there and get her medicine chest.
795311 797609 We was getting worried about you,<br />Miss Ellen.
797680 800308 - Mr. Gerald...<br />- All right, Pork. I'm home.
800749 804412 Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing<br />the creek bottom today.
804487 807081 What do you want me<br />to start on tomorrow?
807156 810887 Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come<br />from Emmie Slattery's bedside.
811026 812584 Your child has been born.
812695 815926 My child, ma'am?<br />I'm sure I don't understand.
816098 818430 Has been born, and mercifully, has died.
819301 820962 Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
824340 826740 I'll fix your supper for you myself,<br />and you eats it.
826809 827935 After prayers, Mammy.
828010 829136 Yes, ma'am.
830346 831677 Mr. O'Hara.
832248 833875 You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
833949 837510 Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?<br />He's the best overseer in the county.
837586 839645 He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.
839722 840814 But...
842291 843383 - No!<br />- Yes.
844793 847523 The Yankee Wilkerson<br />and the white trash Slattery girl?
847596 849564 We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
849665 850757 Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
856539 858234 I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!
858307 861003 I don't like your tone, Suellen.<br />Your pink gown is lovely.
861076 864773 - Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?<br />- But you may wear my garnets with it.
864847 867372 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
867449 869110 Scarlett...
869184 871744 you look tired, my dear.<br />I'm worried about you.
872655 873986 I'm all right, Mother.
874089 876319 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
876392 877484 I'm 13 now.
877560 880256 You may go to the barbecue<br />and stay up till supper.
880329 882627 I didn't want to wear<br />your tacky green dress anyhow.
882698 883722 Oh, hush up!
883799 885289 Prayers, girls.
891974 896877 "And to all the saints, that I have sinned<br />exceedingly in thought, word and deed...
897246 898543 "through my fault.
898747 901910 "Through my fault,<br />through my most grievous fault.
902384 905717 "Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary,<br />ever Virgin...
905854 908118 "Blessed Michael, the Archangel...
908290 910190 "Blessed John the Baptist...
910259 912523 "the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...
913195 916187 "and all the saints<br />to pray to the Lord, our God, for me. "
916298 918357 Ashley doesn't know I love him.
919568 923231 I'll tell him that I love him<br />and then he can't marry her.
924506 927532 "May the Almighty,<br />and most merciful Lord...
927610 929373 "grant us pardon, absolution...
930012 931536 "and remission of our sins. Amen. "
934249 936809 Just hold on and suck in.
937653 939917 Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.
940155 942589 You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.
942658 944250 Oh, yes, ma'am, you is!
944360 946624 You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.
947696 949721 No, I'm not!
952468 954527 Put on the dress, 'cause we're late already.
954603 956503 - What's my lamb gonna wear?<br />- That.
956572 960599 No you ain't! You can't show your bosom<br />before 3:00.
960743 962643 I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!
962711 966078 If you say one word to Mother,<br />I won't eat a bite.
970119 971143 Well...
977826 981125 Keep your shawl on.<br />I ain't aiming for you to get all freckled...
981196 985326 after the buttermilk I done put on you<br />all this winter, bleaching them freckles.
991607 995543 Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on<br />and be good, and eat just a little, honey.
995611 996669 No.
996979 1000779 I'm going to have a good time today<br />and do my eating at the barbecue.
1000949 1003782 If you don't care what folks says<br />about this family, I does!
1003852 1007117 I has told you and told you<br />that you can always tell a lady...
1007189 1009316 by the way she eats with folks. Like a bird.
1009391 1011518 I ain't aiming for you to go to Mr. Wilkes'...
1011593 1013823 and eat like a field hand<br />and gobble like a hog!
1013896 1015227 Fiddle-dee-dee.
1015631 1018964 Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl<br />with a healthy appetite.
1019034 1022026 What gentlemen says and<br />what they thinks is two different things.
1022104 1025096 And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley<br />asking to marry you!
1041223 1045159 Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need<br />of having it come right back up again.
1047696 1050631 Why does a girl have to be so silly<br />to catch a husband?
1050866 1055735 Scarlett, if you're not here by the time<br />I count ten, we'll be going without you!
1055971 1057199 I'm coming, Pa!
1057339 1058397 One...
1058474 1060101 two, three...
1060809 1062868 four, five, six...
1063846 1064972 Oh, dear!
1065247 1068978 My stays are so tight I know I'll never<br />get through the day without belching.
1093876 1097573 Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day<br />you'll be having for the barbecue.
1097646 1100581 So it seems, Gerald.<br />But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
1100649 1102776 She's after settling accounts<br />with the overseer.
1102885 1104716 But she'll be along for the ball tonight.
1104787 1106618 Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
1106688 1108713 Thank you kindly, India.
1108791 1111487 Your daughter's getting prettier every day,<br />John.
1112027 1114825 India, here are the O'Hara girls.<br />We must greet them.
1114897 1118333 I can't stand Scarlett. If you see<br />the way she throws herself at Ashley.
1118400 1120425 Now, that's your brother's business.
1120502 1123130 You must remember your duties<br />as hostess.
1123205 1125435 Good morning, girls. You're looking lovely.
1126008 1127635 Good morning, Scarlett.
1128210 1130701 Why, India Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
1130913 1134144 - Perfectly lovely, darling.<br />- I just can't take my eyes off it.
1136084 1137142 Scarlett, honey...
1137219 1139210 You're looking mighty fine this morning.
1139288 1141586 - Good morning, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good morning.
1142191 1144216 - It's a pleasure to see you.<br />- Good morning.
1144293 1145521 Howdy, Miss Scarlett.
1147029 1148053 Ashley!
1150532 1152090 Scarlett, my dear.
1153669 1155796 I've been looking for you everywhere.
1155871 1157839 I've got something I must tell you.
1158006 1161498 - Can't we go some place where it's quiet?<br />- Yes, I'd like to, but I...
1161710 1163575 I have something to tell you, too.
1163645 1166409 Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
1167416 1169816 But come say hello<br />to my cousin Melanie, first.
1169885 1171477 Oh, do we have to?
1171787 1174620 She's been looking forward<br />to seeing you again.
1174723 1175747 Melanie!
1176959 1178483 Here's Scarlett.
1178927 1179916 Scarlett!
1181430 1183057 I'm so glad to see you again.
1183131 1186123 Melanie Hamilton!<br />What a surprise to run into you here.
1186401 1188494 I hope you'll stay with us<br />a few days at least.
1188570 1192028 I hope I shall stay long enough for us<br />to become real friends, Scarlett.
1192107 1193438 I do so want us to be.
1193508 1195305 We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?
1195377 1197811 We'll just have to make<br />the biggest fuss over her.
1197880 1201111 If there's anybody knows how to give<br />a girl a good time, it's Ashley.
1201183 1205017 Though I expect our good times will seem<br />silly to you because you're so serious.
1205087 1207647 Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
1207723 1209213 I've always admired you so.
1209291 1210918 I wish I could be more like you.
1210993 1213928 You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,<br />and say things you don't mean.
1213996 1217397 Nobody could accuse Melanie<br />of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
1218000 1220059 Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?
1220135 1222535 Ashley never means a word he says<br />to any girl.
1223105 1226597 Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,<br />you handsome old thing, you!
1226675 1228142 But, oh, Miss O'Hara, I...
1228210 1230644 Was it kind to bring<br />your good-looking brother here...
1230712 1233203 just to break my poor, simple,<br />country girl's heart?
1233282 1235250 She never even noticed Charles before.
1235317 1237785 Because he's your beau,<br />she's after him like a hornet.
1237853 1240321 Charles Hamilton,<br />I want to eat barbecue with you.
1240389 1244189 Mind you, don't go philandering with<br />any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.
1244259 1245658 I won't, Miss O'Hara!
1246128 1247390 I couldn't!
1247896 1250592 I do declare, Frank Kennedy,<br />if you don't look dashing...
1250666 1251997 with that new set of whiskers!
1252067 1254558 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
1255003 1257733 Charles and Rafe asked me<br />to eat barbecue with them...
1257806 1260070 but I told them I couldn't<br />because I promised you.
1260142 1263737 You needn't be so amused. Look at her!<br />She's after your beau now!
1264146 1266944 Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1267482 1269473 I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.
1269685 1272245 What's your sister so mad about?<br />You sparking her beau?
1272321 1275381 As if I couldn't get a better beau<br />than that old maid in britches.
1275457 1278984 Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome<br />old things, you! No, you're not!
1279061 1280585 I won't say that. I'm mad at you!
1280662 1281651 What have we done?
1281730 1284164 You haven't been near me all day.<br />I wore this dress...
1284232 1285460 'cause I thought you liked it.
1285534 1287593 I was counting on eating barbecue<br />with you two.
1287669 1289864 - Well, you are, Scarlett.<br />- Of course you are.
1289938 1293874 Oh, I never can make up my mind<br />which of you two is the handsomer.
1294209 1297372 I was awake all last night<br />trying to figure it out.
1302951 1304680 Cathleen, who's that?
1304753 1305777 Who?
1305854 1307879 That man looking at us and smiling.
1308256 1309450 The nasty, dark one.
1309558 1313585 My dear, don't you know?<br />That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.
1313662 1315789 He has the most terrible reputation.
1320635 1323866 He looks as if he knows<br />what I look like without my shimmy!
1323939 1324997 Scarlett!
1325374 1327171 Why, my dear, he isn't received!
1327442 1329000 He spends a lot of time up North...
1329077 1331705 because his folks in Charleston<br />won't even speak to him.
1331780 1334112 He was expelled from West Point,<br />he's so fast.
1334182 1337447 And then there's that business<br />about that girl he wouldn't marry.
1337519 1338543 Tell, tell!
1338720 1342952 Well, he took her out buggy riding<br />in the late afternoon without a chaperon!
1343525 1346016 And then he refused to marry her!
1349631 1352225 No, but she was ruined just the same.
1357973 1359497 Ashley!
1359674 1360766 Happy?
1360876 1361865 So happy!
1363612 1365739 You seem to belong here...
1366181 1368615 as if it had all been imagined for you.
1370018 1372418 I like to feel that I belong<br />to the things you love.
1372487 1374079 You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
1374156 1375214 Yes, Ashley.
1375624 1377114 I love it as...
1377192 1378716 as more than a house.
1379361 1383354 It's a whole world that wants only<br />to be graceful and beautiful.
1383498 1385659 It's so unaware that it may not last...
1386401 1387493 forever.
1387569 1390834 You're afraid of what may happen<br />if the war comes, aren't you?
1390972 1393566 But we don't have to be afraid for us.
1394142 1396610 No war can come into our world, Ashley.
1397612 1398909 Whatever comes...
1399614 1402344 I'll love you, just as I do now...
1403118 1404244 until I die.
1409224 1411089 Isn't this better than sitting at a table?
1411159 1413627 A girl hasn't got but two sides to her<br />at a table.
1415030 1416122 I'll go get her dessert.
1416198 1418598 - Here, she said me.<br />- Allow me, Miss O'Hara.
1420836 1422030 I think...
1425340 1428138 I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
1429744 1431405 Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!
1431947 1433175 Thank you.
1433415 1434541 Go get it.
1434716 1436843 Isn't he the luckiest?
1444159 1445183 Miss O'Hara...
1446728 1447717 I love you.
1449331 1451731 I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
1455137 1457935 Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.
1458206 1460538 Well-brought-up young ladies<br />take naps at parties.
1460609 1464568 It's high time you started behaving and<br />acting like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
1464646 1468047 When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice<br />any Yankee girls taking naps.
1468116 1471984 No, and you ain't gonna see<br />no Yankee girls at the ball tonight, neither.
1472154 1473746 How was Ashley today, Scarlett?
1473822 1476416 He didn't seem to be paying<br />much attention to you.
1476491 1478186 You mind your own business!
1478260 1480660 You'll be lucky not to lose<br />old whisker-face Kennedy.
1480729 1482162 You've liked Ashley for months!
1482230 1484858 Pa said that his engagement's<br />gonna be announced tonight.
1484933 1486298 That's all you know.
1486801 1489326 Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!<br />You all behave yourselves.
1489404 1491099 Acting like poor white trash children!
1491173 1494665 If you's old enough to go to parties,<br />you's old enough to act like ladies.
1494743 1495869 Who cares!
1547062 1549587 We've borne enough insults<br />from the meddling Yankees.
1549664 1552326 It's time we made them understand<br />we'll keep our slaves...
1552400 1553731 with or without their approval.
1553802 1557203 'Twas Georgia's sovereign right<br />to secede from the Union!
1557272 1558261 That's right!
1558340 1560831 The South must assert herself<br />by force of arms.
1560909 1565073 After we've fired on the Yankee rascals<br />at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!
1565247 1567613 - There's no other way!<br />- Fight! That's right. Fight!
1567682 1569411 Let the Yankees ask for peace!
1569484 1573113 The situation is very simple.<br />The Yankees can't fight and we can.
1574155 1575588 There won't even be a battle.
1575657 1577284 They'll just turn and run every time.
1577359 1579156 One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.
1579227 1581058 We'll finish them in one battle.
1581129 1583154 Gentlemen can always fight better<br />than rabble.
1583231 1585631 Yes, gentlemen always can fight better<br />than rabble.
1585700 1587861 What does the captain of our troop say?
1588036 1591472 Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights,<br />I go with her.
1591906 1595569 But, like my father, I hope the Yankees<br />will let us leave the Union in peace.
1595644 1597908 - But, Ashley...<br />- But, Ashley, they've insulted us!
1597979 1599446 You can't mean you don't want war!
1599514 1602950 Most of the miseries of the world<br />were caused by wars.
1603051 1607044 And when the wars were over<br />no one ever knew what they were about.
1607122 1608589 If it wasn't that I knew you...
1608657 1612684 Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been<br />up North, I hear.
1612827 1614886 Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?
1615430 1617990 I think it's hard winning a war with words,<br />gentlemen.
1618066 1619465 What do you mean, sir?
1619601 1622365 There's not a cannon factory<br />in the whole South.
1622437 1624462 What difference does that make<br />to a gentleman?
1624539 1627804 Lt'll make a great deal of difference<br />to a great many gentlemen, sir.
1627876 1630640 Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,<br />that the Yankees can lick us?
1630712 1631770 No, I'm not hinting.
1631846 1635077 I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees<br />are better equipped than we.
1635150 1637414 They've got factories, shipyards,<br />coal mines...
1637485 1640318 and a fleet to bottle up our harbors<br />and starve us to death.
1640388 1643721 All we've got is cotton and slaves<br />and arrogance.
1643792 1647319 - That's treacherous!<br />- I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
1647562 1649086 I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
1649164 1651462 Apologies aren't enough, sir!
1651533 1654434 I hear you were turned out of West Point,<br />Mr. Rhett Butler...
1654502 1658734 and you aren't received by any decent<br />family in Charleston, not even your own!
1663178 1666147 I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
1667782 1670808 Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about<br />and look over your place.
1670885 1674184 I seem to be spoiling<br />everybody's brandy and cigars and...
1674456 1675718 dreams of victory.
1682931 1686458 That's just about what you could expect<br />from somebody like Rhett Butler.
1686534 1688331 You did everything but call him out.
1688403 1689563 He refused to fight.
1689637 1692435 Not quite that, Charles.<br />He refused to take advantage of you.
1692507 1693531 Take advantage of me?
1693608 1697066 He's one of the best shots in the country,<br />as he's proved several times...
1697145 1698942 against steadier hands and cooler heads.
1699013 1700207 - I'll show him!<br />- No, please.
1700281 1702806 Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
1702884 1705717 You may be needed<br />for more important fighting, Charles.
1706020 1708454 Now, if you'll excuse me,<br />Mr. Butler is our guest.
1708523 1710616 I think I'll just show him around.
1723371 1724463 Ashley!
1732080 1733638 Ashley!
1734015 1735073 Scarlett.
1736951 1739146 Who are you hiding from in here?
1744426 1746121 What are you up to?
1748163 1751189 Well, why aren't you upstairs<br />resting with the other girls?
1752500 1754525 What is this, Scarlett? A secret?
1754936 1757302 Oh, Ashley, Ashley...
1757972 1759132 I love you.
1759441 1760465 Scarlett!
1760542 1762009 I love you, I do!
1764412 1768075 Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered<br />every other man's heart today?
1768149 1770549 You've always had mine.<br />You cut your teeth on it.
1770618 1772245 Oh, don't tease me now.
1772320 1775118 Have I your heart, my darling?<br />I love you, I love you.
1775190 1778819 You mustn't say such things.<br />You'll hate me for hearing them.
1778927 1783091 Oh, I could never hate you,<br />and I know you must care about me.
1783498 1785625 Oh, you do care, don't you?
1786868 1787994 Yes...
1788503 1789629 I care.
1791139 1794006 Oh, can't we go away and forget<br />we ever said these things?
1795844 1797505 But how can we do that?
1797846 1800076 Don't you want to marry me?
1800215 1801739 I'm going to marry Melanie.
1801883 1804249 But you can't. Not if you care for me.
1804419 1807547 Oh, my dear, why must you make me<br />say things that will hurt you?
1808456 1810515 How can I make you understand?
1811226 1812716 You're so young and unthinking.
1812794 1814318 You don't know what marriage means.
1814395 1816829 I know I love you<br />and I want to be your wife.
1816931 1818364 You don't love Melanie.
1818566 1820033 She's like me, Scarlett.
1820435 1823165 She's part of my blood<br />and we understand each other.
1823471 1825336 But you love me.
1825573 1827200 How could I help loving you?
1827709 1830109 You have all the passion for life that I lack.
1830178 1832874 That kind of love isn't enough<br />for a successful marriage...
1832947 1834608 for two people as different as we are.
1834682 1837776 Well, why don't you say it, you coward?<br />You're afraid to marry me.
1837852 1840412 You'd rather live with that fool<br />who can't speak except...
1840488 1844185 to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel<br />of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.
1844259 1846022 You mustn't say such things<br />about Melanie.
1846094 1847459 Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
1847529 1850293 You led me on, you made me believe<br />you wanted to marry me.
1850365 1852697 Now, Scarlett, be fair.<br />I never, at any time...
1852767 1856294 You did, it's true you did!<br />I'll hate you till I die!
1856905 1860204 I can't think of anything bad enough<br />to call you.
1887201 1889066 Has the war started?
1889671 1893072 Sir, you should have made<br />your presence known.
1893374 1895535 In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
1895743 1897938 That wouldn't have been very tactful,<br />would it?
1898012 1900572 But don't worry,<br />your secret is safe with me.
1901115 1902275 Sir, you are no gentleman!
1902350 1904477 And you, miss, are no lady.
1904953 1906784 Don't think I hold that against you.
1906854 1908583 Ladies have never held any charm for me.
1908656 1911682 First you take a low, common advantage<br />of me, then you insult me.
1911759 1915195 I meant it as a compliment<br />and I hope to see more of you...
1915263 1918096 when you're free of the spell<br />of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.
1918166 1922432 He doesn't strike me as half good enough<br />for a girl of your... What was it?
1922670 1924137 Your "passion for living. "
1924339 1926967 How dare you!<br />You aren't fit to wipe his boots.
1928376 1931368 And you were going to hate him<br />for the rest of your life.
1933848 1937841 She certainly made a fool of herself<br />running after all the men at the barbecue.
1937919 1939580 That's not fair, India.
1939654 1942418 She's so attractive,<br />the men just naturally flock to her.
1942490 1944424 Oh, Melanie, you're just too good<br />to be true.
1944492 1946858 Didn't you see her<br />going after your brother Charles?
1946928 1948896 Yes, and she knows<br />Charles belongs to me.
1948963 1950590 Oh, you're wrong, India.
1950665 1953725 Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
1954102 1956764 Men may flirt with girls like that<br />but they don't marry them.
1956838 1959033 I think you're being very mean to her.
1967682 1970651 War! War's declared! War!
1982330 1983729 Miss O'Hara!
1986768 1987928 Miss O'Hara!
1988202 1991501 Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,<br />volunteers to fight against us.
1991572 1994166 Don't you men ever think<br />about anything important?
1994242 1996403 But it's war and everybody's going off<br />to enlist.
1996477 1998240 They're going right away. I'm going, too.
1998312 1999370 Everybody?
2003685 2006085 Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
2006320 2007947 To see us go, I mean.
2008623 2010557 I'll cry into my pillow every night.
2010692 2012683 Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
2012860 2017263 You're the most beautiful girl in the world,<br />and the sweetest and the dearest.
2017398 2019696 I know I couldn't hope<br />that you could love me.
2019767 2023225 I'm so clumsy and stupid<br />and not nearly good enough for you.
2023304 2027172 But if you could think of marrying me,<br />I'd do anything in the world for you.
2027241 2028765 Just anything. I promise.
2029310 2030572 What did you say?
2030778 2033611 Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?
2039253 2041221 Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
2041889 2044153 You will? You'll marry me?<br />You'll wait for me?
2044592 2045923 I don't think I'd want to wait.
2045993 2048427 You mean you'll marry me before I go?
2048930 2050898 Oh, Miss O'Hara.
2050965 2052694 Scarlett...
2054302 2055792 When may I speak to your father?
2055870 2056928 The sooner the better.
2057004 2058562 I'll go now. I can't wait.
2058639 2060539 Will you excuse me, dear?
2065480 2067345 Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.
2067415 2069508 It'll be a week at least<br />before they call on me.
2069584 2072712 Only a week, and then they'll take you<br />away from me.
2105720 2108348 Scarlett, I thought of you<br />at our wedding yesterday...
2108422 2111516 and I hoped that yours would be<br />as beautiful, and it was.
2112160 2113184 Was it?
2113594 2116028 Now we're really and truly sisters.
2116697 2118187 - Charles.<br />- Melanie.
2126107 2129235 Don't cry, darling.<br />The war will be over in a few weeks...
2129310 2131437 and I'll be coming back to you.
2175356 2176516 Miss Scarlett!
2177592 2180755 Well, I don't care.<br />I'm too young to be a widow.
2181128 2182425 Miss Scarlett!
2183998 2186626 Why, I'd just go around scaring people<br />in that thing.
2187668 2190330 You ain't supposed to be around people.<br />You's in mourning.
2190404 2192702 For what? I don't feel anything.
2193307 2195969 Why should I have to pretend<br />and pretend...
2196611 2198010 What is it?
2198880 2201007 Oh, baby...
2202283 2203614 What is it?
2203684 2205083 My life is over.
2205419 2207979 Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.
2210424 2211755 Oh, Mother.
2211826 2216320 I know you'll think I'm horrible,<br />but I just can't bear going around in black.
2216664 2219258 It's bad enough not being able<br />to go to any parties...
2219333 2220960 but looking this way, too.
2221035 2222935 I don't think you're at all horrible.
2223004 2227134 It's only natural to want to look young<br />and be young when you are young.
2227508 2229237 Oh, baby...
2230211 2232179 How would you like<br />to go visiting somewhere?
2232246 2233406 Savannah, perhaps?
2233481 2235540 What would I do in Savannah?
2235716 2237308 Well, Atlanta, then.
2237618 2239643 There's lots going on there.
2239720 2242814 And you could stay<br />with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
2243591 2244751 Melanie.
2245259 2246351 Yes.
2247161 2248423 Yes, I could, couldn't I?
2248496 2251624 Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,<br />sweeter than anybody in the world.
2251766 2253131 You'd like it, really?
2253634 2256899 All right then.<br />Now stop your crying and smile.
2258739 2260400 You can take Prissy with you.
2260975 2263341 Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,<br />Mammy.
2263678 2265578 I'll go write the necessary letters.
2268582 2269571 Atlanta!
2269650 2273017 Savannah would be better for you.<br />You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.
2273087 2274611 What trouble are you talking about?
2274689 2278386 You know what trouble I's talking about.<br />I's talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.
2278459 2280586 He'll come to Atlanta<br />when he gets his leave...
2280661 2283186 and you're sitting there<br />waiting for him like a spider!
2283264 2286597 - He belongs to Miss Melanie...<br />- You go pack my things like Mother said.
2307621 2310385 They're all whispering,<br />and I just know it's about her.
2310458 2312449 What's it matter what they say,<br />Aunt Pittypat?
2312526 2317156 But Scarlett is living under my roof,<br />so they all think I'm responsible for her.
2317264 2320995 And for a widow to appear in public<br />at a social gathering!
2321068 2323696 Every time I think of it I feel faint!
2323871 2328103 Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here<br />only to help raise money for the cause.
2328175 2331235 It was splendid of her<br />to make the sacrifice.
2331379 2333108 Anyone would think, to hear you talk...
2333180 2336672 that she came here to dance<br />instead of to sell things.
2349030 2350759 Ladies and gentlemen!
2350831 2353527 I have important news! Glorious news!
2353901 2356995 Another triumph<br />for our magnificent men in arms.
2357738 2360969 General Lee has completely<br />whipped the enemy...
2361042 2365035 and swept the Yankee Army<br />northward from Virginia.
2374155 2377283 And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
2377758 2381888 We have with us tonight that most daring<br />of all blockade-runners...
2382263 2385824 whose fleet schooners,<br />slipping past the Yankee guns...
2385900 2389734 have brought us here the very woolens<br />and laces we wear tonight.
2389937 2393998 I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that<br />will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main.
2394208 2397006 None other than our friend<br />from Charleston...
2397311 2398869 Capt. Rhett Butler!
2419834 2421233 Permit me.
2425539 2428736 Capt. Butler, it's such a pleasure<br />to see you again.
2429043 2431068 I met you last at my husband's home.
2431178 2433408 That's kind of you to remember,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2433814 2436442 Did you meet Capt. Butler<br />at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
2436517 2438610 Yes, I think so.
2438886 2441514 Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />It was in the library.
2441589 2443489 You had broken something.
2444592 2447026 Yes, Capt. Butler, I remember you.
2447094 2451121 Ladies, the Confederacy asks for<br />your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.
2451198 2453257 We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.
2453334 2454596 Wait.
2455202 2457568 On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br />and Mrs. Hamilton.
2458606 2459937 Thank you, Capt. Butler.
2460241 2461868 Just a moment, please.
2464678 2466703 But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
2467114 2470413 It may help my husband more,<br />off my finger.
2471051 2472177 Thank you.
2474655 2477215 That's a very beautiful thing to do,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2477725 2478783 Here.
2479059 2481619 You can have mine, too, for the cause.
2483898 2487766 And you, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />I know just how much that means to you.
2488002 2489367 - Melanie!<br />- Yes, Dr. Meade.
2489436 2491836 I need your approval,<br />as a member of the Committee...
2491906 2494431 for something we want to do<br />that's rather shocking.
2494942 2496842 Will you excuse us, please?
2498979 2502642 I'll say one thing. The war makes<br />the most peculiar widows.
2502917 2504077 I wish you'd go away.
2504151 2507348 If you had any raising you'd know<br />I'd never want to see you again.
2510224 2511691 Now, why be silly?
2511759 2515923 You've no reason for hating me.<br />I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
2517631 2521226 I guess I'd be very unpatriotic<br />to hate one of the great heroes of the war.
2521302 2525068 I do declare I was surprised to see you<br />turn out to be such a noble character.
2525139 2528631 I can't bear to take advantage<br />of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.
2528709 2530768 I'm neither noble nor heroic.
2530978 2532309 But you are a blockade-runner?
2532379 2534438 For profit, and profit only.
2534648 2536878 Are you telling me<br />you don't believe in the cause?
2536951 2539579 I believe in Rhett Butler.<br />He's the only cause I know.
2539653 2540984 The rest doesn't mean much to me.
2544592 2546560 And now, ladies and gentlemen...
2546660 2549629 I have a startling surprise<br />for the benefit of the hospital.
2551398 2555528 Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening<br />reel with the lady of your choice...
2555836 2557565 you must bid for her.
2559073 2562133 Caroline Meade, how can you permit<br />your husband to conduct this...
2562209 2563836 this slave auction?
2563911 2566471 Dolly Merriwether,<br />how dare you criticize me!
2566847 2568405 Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...
2568482 2571451 that if it's for the benefit of the cause,<br />it's quite all right.
2571518 2572712 She did!
2572786 2575812 Oh dear, oh dear.<br />Where are my smelling salts?
2576190 2577452 I think I shall faint.
2577524 2579856 Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.
2580027 2582621 If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
2583864 2586662 Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?<br />Make your offers.
2587601 2589262 Don't be bashful, gentlemen.
2590070 2593972 $20. $20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.
2594108 2596303 $25 for Miss Fanny Elsing.
2596377 2598504 Only $25 to give your...
2598646 2600705 $150 in gold.
2601248 2602442 For what lady, sir?
2602549 2604517 For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2607421 2608513 For whom, sir?
2609023 2610581 Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2610658 2612819 Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,<br />Capt. Butler...
2612926 2615690 but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles<br />would be proud to...
2615763 2619221 Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2620034 2622229 She will not consider it, sir.
2622469 2623800 Oh, yes, I will.
2636050 2638951 Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.
2640354 2642379 We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.
2642456 2644390 It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?
2644458 2645447 It's worse.
2645526 2647460 But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
2647528 2649655 I don't care what you expect<br />or what they think.
2649730 2651027 I'm going to dance and dance.
2651098 2654124 Tonight I wouldn't mind<br />dancing with Abe Lincoln himself.
2685966 2688560 Another dance and my reputation<br />will be lost forever.
2688635 2691035 With enough courage,<br />you can do without a reputation.
2691105 2692572 Oh, you do talk scandalous.
2700981 2703245 You do waltz divinely, Capt. Butler.
2703484 2707284 Don't start flirting with me.<br />I'm not one of your plantation beaux.
2707421 2709651 I want more than flirting from you.
2710190 2711817 What do you want?
2712259 2716628 I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take<br />that Southern belle simper off your face.
2717498 2719022 Some day I want you to say to me...
2719099 2721932 the words I heard you say<br />to Ashley Wilkes:
2722302 2723462 "I love you. "
2724004 2728236 That's something you'll never hear from<br />me, Capt. Butler, as long as you live.
2748829 2751024 How sweet, how kind.
2751098 2753066 He is a thoughtful gentleman.
2753133 2756864 Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say<br />something about my sacrifice?
2764778 2766871 Oh, the darling thing.
2766947 2768881 Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.
2769049 2772143 You didn't really bring it all the way<br />from Paris just for me.
2772219 2775677 Yes, I thought it was about time<br />I got you out of that fake mourning.
2775989 2779049 Next trip, I'll bring you some green silk<br />for a frock to match it.
2779126 2780150 Oh, Rhett.
2780561 2785498 It's my duty to our brave boys at the front<br />to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
2786200 2788634 Oh, it's so long<br />since I've had anything new.
2799346 2800404 How do I look?
2801715 2803546 Awful! Just awful.
2803884 2805146 Why, what's the matter?
2805252 2806776 This war has stopped being a joke...
2806854 2810119 when a girl like you doesn't know<br />how to wear the latest fashion.
2815162 2817824 Oh, Rhett, let me do it.
2823270 2826171 But, Rhett, I don't know<br />how I'd dare wear it.
2827040 2828166 You will, though.
2829009 2831500 And another thing. Those pantalets.
2831612 2834513 I don't know a woman in Paris<br />who wears pantalets anymore.
2834648 2835740 Oh, what do they...
2836316 2838443 You shouldn't talk about such things.
2838519 2839508 You little hypocrite.
2839586 2842111 You don't mind my knowing about them,<br />just my talking.
2842189 2846023 I really can't go on accepting these gifts,<br />though you are awfully kind.
2846093 2848027 I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.
2848095 2851963 I never give anything without expecting<br />something in return. I always get paid.
2852032 2854728 If you think I'll marry you to pay<br />for the bonnet, I won't.
2854801 2857167 Don't flatter yourself.<br />I'm not a marrying man.
2857771 2860467 Well, I won't kiss you for it, either.
2870817 2872580 Open your eyes and look at me.
2874021 2875955 No, I don't think I will kiss you...
2876023 2877718 although you need kissing badly.
2877791 2879122 That's what's wrong with you.
2879192 2882127 You should be kissed, and often.<br />And by someone who knows how.
2882195 2884857 Oh, and I suppose you think<br />you're the proper person.
2884932 2887730 I might be, if the right moment ever came.
2888235 2890931 You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,<br />Rhett Butler.
2891004 2893734 And I don't know why<br />I let you come and see me.
2894074 2895701 I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
2895776 2897971 Because I'm the only man over 16<br />and under 60...
2898045 2900343 who's around to show you a good time.
2900414 2902974 But cheer up,<br />the war can't last much longer.
2903116 2904583 Really, Rhett? Why?
2904651 2908280 There's a battle going on right now<br />that ought to pretty well fix things...
2908355 2909413 one way or the other.
2909489 2911389 Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
2912893 2916260 You haven't gotten the wooden-headed<br />Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
2916330 2917661 Yes, I suppose he's in it.
2917731 2919722 Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?
2920033 2923196 Some little town in Pennsylvania<br />called Gettysburg.
2952666 2954634 Casualty list.
3004651 3005743 Here you is, Miss Melanie.
3005819 3008515 They was fighting for them,<br />so it just got tore in half.
3008789 3011587 Scarlett, you look. The "W's" at the end.
3015495 3018862 "Wellman, Wendell, White,<br />Whitner, Wilkins...
3019533 3020727 "Williams, Woolsey, Workman. "
3020801 3023065 Scarlett, you've passed him.
3023670 3025501 Oh, he isn't there!
3025572 3026561 He isn't there!
3026640 3028835 Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.
3028909 3031070 Oh, he's safe, he's safe.
3032913 3036906 Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet<br />to worry about Ashley like this for me.
3044357 3045790 I must go to her.
3047260 3049091 Don't, my dear, not here.
3050063 3051325 Let's go home.
3052833 3054528 Dr. Meade, not...
3054601 3057263 Yes, our boy, Darcy.
3058038 3060734 I was making these mittens for him.
3061341 3063172 He won't need them now.
3064044 3067639 Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show them.<br />I'll kill all those Yankees.
3067714 3069079 Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.
3069149 3072312 You think it'll help your mother<br />to have you off getting shot, too?
3072385 3073943 I never heard of anything so silly.
3076523 3079651 It's a black day, Scarlett.<br />You haven't had bad news, have you?
3079793 3080953 Ashley's safe.
3081027 3082722 I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
3082796 3084388 Rhett, there are so many others.
3084464 3085488 Any of your friends?
3085565 3089296 Just about every family in the county.<br />The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.
3089369 3093066 Yes, look at them.<br />All these poor tragic people.
3093907 3097434 The South's sinking to its knees.<br />It'll never rise again.
3098211 3099542 The cause...
3099846 3102974 The cause of living in the past<br />is dying right in front of us.
3103150 3105118 I never heard you talk like that before.
3105185 3109349 I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.<br />And that's what all this is, sheer waste.
3111558 3113082 But don't you be downcast.
3113393 3116829 Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home<br />to the women who love him...
3117164 3118563 both of them.
3155302 3156826 Oh, you're here.
3160240 3163209 Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.
3163510 3165705 Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.
3165912 3168312 Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.
3172252 3174311 Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.
3175822 3177119 Scarlett, dear.
3179559 3183325 Well, is this any way to greet<br />a returning warrior?
3183663 3185187 Ashley, I...
3188368 3190336 Merry Christmas, Ashley.
3198612 3202412 Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br />We've got all your wives.
3203183 3205083 We've got all your little chicks.
3205151 3208279 You got nobody to worry your head<br />about leaving.
3208688 3209746 Come on.
3210123 3214526 Now you just stand still so you can be<br />a Christmas gift for the white folks.
3214995 3216326 Now hold on.
3216730 3217788 Hold on!
3218531 3220556 Don't go getting so uppity...
3220634 3223034 even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.
3225405 3227737 Let's not talk about the war.<br />It's Christmas.
3228041 3231738 Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara,<br />and all the times before the war.
3231811 3233335 Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?
3233413 3235813 Why did you say there wasn't enough,<br />Uncle Peter?
3235882 3239409 There's plenty. It's the very last<br />of my father's fine Madeira.
3239619 3243521 He got it from his uncle,<br />Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
3243623 3246956 who married his cousin,<br />Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...
3247160 3250789 who was his second cousin once removed<br />and a kin to the Wilkeses, too.
3250897 3254298 I saved it to wish Ashley<br />a Merry Christmas.
3255068 3258765 But you mustn't drink it all at once<br />because it is the last.
3263576 3266340 I meant it, my dear.<br />It was a lovely Christmas gift.
3266713 3269079 Only generals have tunics like this<br />nowadays.
3269149 3270912 I'm so happy you like it, dear.
3270984 3272781 Where did you get the cloth?
3272852 3274979 It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.
3275055 3279685 I nursed her son while he was in<br />the hospital, Ashley, before he died and...
3279759 3282387 Oh, you will take good care of it,<br />won't you?
3282462 3284555 You won't let it get torn.
3284998 3286056 Promise me.
3286132 3287292 You mustn't worry.
3287801 3291202 I'll bring it back to you<br />without any holes in it, I promise.
3294207 3295231 Good night, my dear.
3295308 3297572 Good night, Scarlett, darling.
3310490 3312890 Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,<br />for Mr. Ashley to leave?
3312959 3314824 Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
3314894 3318352 She isn't going to the depot with him?<br />She hasn't changed her mind?
3318431 3320160 No, ma'am. She's laying down.
3320233 3324465 She's so upset Mr. Wilkes told her<br />she can't even come downstairs.
3330643 3331735 Ashley!
3335982 3338746 Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
3339252 3342415 Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you<br />as you are now...
3342489 3344389 not shivering at the depot.
3344457 3345651 All right.
3346659 3349628 Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.
3356703 3358967 Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.
3359305 3361170 Tie it on me, my dear.
3362375 3366243 While Melly was making your new tunic,<br />I made this to go with it.
3366846 3368643 You made it yourself?
3369149 3371982 Well, then I shall value it all the more.
3372185 3375245 You know there's nothing<br />I wouldn't do for you.
3376222 3378019 There's something you can do for me.
3378091 3379456 What is it?
3379692 3382252 Will you look after Melanie for me?
3382829 3386196 She's so frail and gentle<br />and she loves you so much.
3386266 3387790 You see, if I were killed and she...
3387867 3391701 Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.<br />Say a prayer quickly.
3391771 3393170 You say one for me.
3394340 3397707 We shall need all our prayers<br />now the end is coming.
3397911 3398900 The end?
3398978 3400741 The end of the war.
3401381 3403906 And the end of our world, Scarlett.
3404184 3407483 But, Ashley, you don't think<br />the Yankees are beating us?
3407554 3410523 Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...
3411624 3414024 and the snow in Virginia is deep.
3414627 3416322 When I see them...
3416463 3420797 and I see the Yankees coming<br />and coming, always more and more...
3423803 3426966 Well, when the end does come<br />I shall be far away.
3427507 3430738 It'll be a comfort to me to know<br />that she has you.
3431111 3433238 You will promise, won't you?
3435849 3436907 Yes.
3438184 3440015 Is that all, Ashley?
3440820 3443550 All except goodbye.
3444090 3446149 Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.
3446226 3447386 - You must be brave...<br />- No...
3447460 3448757 You must.
3449062 3451053 How else can I bear going?
3452098 3455727 Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine<br />and strong and beautiful.
3456936 3459461 Not just your sweet face, my dear...
3459839 3461204 but you.
3464644 3466839 Ashley, kiss me.
3467380 3469041 Kiss me goodbye!
3475488 3476750 No, Scarlett.
3476823 3478757 Oh, Ashley, I love you.
3478992 3482155 I've always loved you.<br />I've never loved anyone else.
3482228 3484856 I only married Charles just to hurt you.
3484931 3487297 Ashley, tell me you love me.
3488101 3490661 I'll live on it the rest of my life.
3492472 3493734 Goodbye.
3513526 3515756 When the war is over, Ashley.
3516596 3518530 When the war is over.
3539015 3541381 And there's a place back home...
3541551 3545146 where a wild plum tree comes to flower<br />in the springtime.
3546022 3548081 Down by the creek, you know.
3548158 3549955 Yes, I know, I know.
3550660 3554221 When we were little,<br />my brother Jeff and I used to...
3554297 3557733 I told you about my brother Jeff,<br />didn't I, ma'am?
3558068 3559592 I know I did.
3559703 3560829 He...
3561104 3563937 We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
3564374 3567673 Since Bull Run we haven't heard<br />anything and...
3568211 3570645 Please, we must have<br />your temperature now.
3570714 3573182 Just take this in your mouth<br />and not talk anymore.
3573250 3574683 Not just now.
3575185 3577983 Melanie, I'm so tired. I've got to go home.
3579122 3581181 Aren't you tired, Melanie?
3581424 3583585 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3584628 3586186 This might be...
3586263 3587457 Ashley.
3588031 3590898 And only strangers here to comfort him.
3591334 3593461 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3594538 3596233 They could all be...
3596706 3597968 Ashley.
3610220 3614316 I've been sitting by this curb one solid<br />hour waiting to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.
3614391 3617087 Go on, you trash,<br />don't you be pestering these ladies.
3617160 3618684 Don't talk to her, Melly.
3618762 3621128 It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?
3621198 3623723 My name's Belle Watling.<br />But that don't matter.
3623834 3626029 I expect you think<br />I've got no business here.
3626102 3628764 Hadn't you best tell me<br />what you want to see me about?
3628839 3632070 First time I come here, I says,<br />"Belle, you're a nurse. "
3632142 3634406 But the ladies didn't want<br />my kind of nursing.
3634477 3636468 Well, they was more than likely right.
3636546 3638673 Then I tried giving them money.
3638748 3640978 My money wasn't good enough<br />for them, either.
3641051 3642382 Old peahens!
3642953 3645513 I know a gentleman<br />who says you're a human being.
3645589 3649320 If you are, which they ain't,<br />you'll take my money for the hospital.
3649392 3652486 What are you doing here?<br />Haven't you been told twice already?
3652562 3654553 This time I'm conversing with Miss Wilkes.
3654631 3656724 You might as well take my money,<br />Miss Wilkes.
3656800 3658825 It's good money, even if it is mine.
3658902 3660494 I'm sure you're very generous.
3660570 3663903 No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate<br />like everybody else, that's all.
3663974 3665498 Of course you are.
3665575 3667839 Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
3667911 3671005 But maybe they ain't<br />as good Christians as you.
3677754 3680484 Look, Mrs. Meade.<br />It's a great deal of money.
3680824 3682985 $10, $20, $30, $50.
3683293 3686091 And it's not our paper money. It's gold.
3686263 3688197 Let me see that handkerchief.
3688265 3689493 "R. B."
3691735 3694932 And she's driving away<br />in Rhett Butler's carriage!
3695972 3699840 Oh, if I just wasn't a lady<br />what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
3733910 3736743 "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
3736980 3739915 "He maketh me to lie down<br />in green pastures.
3740016 3741574 "He leadeth...
3743386 3745251 "He restoreth my soul.
3745655 3749682 "He leadeth me in the paths<br />of righteousness for his name's sake.
3749893 3753454 "Yeah, though I walk through the valley<br />of the shadow of death...
3753530 3755361 "I will fear no evil.
3755432 3756956 "For thou art with me.
3757033 3759866 "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "
3760470 3761528 Yankees!
3762105 3765199 Yankees!<br />Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
3765275 3768733 They'll never get into Atlanta. They'll<br />never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.
3768812 3770473 We'll be safe in the hospital.
3770647 3772877 Give me something for the pain.
