410047 412277 What do we care if we were expelled<br />from college?
412349 415341 The war is gonna start any day.<br />We would've left college anyhow.
415419 417080 War! Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?
417154 419213 You know those fool Yankees<br />actually want a war?
419289 421484 - We'll show them.<br />- Fiddle-dee-dee!
421558 422752 War, war, war.
422859 425851 This war talk's spoiling all the fun<br />at every party this spring.
425929 428227 I get so bored I could scream.
428565 431762 - Besides, there isn't going to be any war.<br />- Not gonna be any war?
431835 434235 Why, honey, of course<br />there's going to be a war!
434304 438331 If either of you says "war" just once again,<br />I'll go in the house and slam the door.
438408 441502 - But, Scarlett, honey...<br />- Don't you want us to have a war?
447417 448543 Well...
449820 451048 but remember...
451521 452749 I warned you.
453090 454523 I've got an idea.
454591 457059 We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue<br />at Twelve Oaks.
457127 459857 That's a good idea.<br />Aren't you eating barbecue with us?
459930 463058 I hadn't thought about that yet.<br />I'll think about that tomorrow.
463133 464327 We want all your waltzes.
464401 467063 First Brent, then me, then Brent,<br />then me again, and so on.
467137 469697 - Promise?<br />- I'd just love to.
470073 473565 If only I didn't have<br />every one of them taken already.
473643 475372 Why, honey, you can't do that to us.
475445 478039 - How about if we tell you a secret?<br />- A secret? Who about?
478115 480242 You know Miss Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta?
480317 482717 Ashley Wilkes' cousin.<br />She's visiting the Wilkes...
482786 485721 That goody-goody!<br />Who wants to know a secret about her?
485789 487416 Anyway, we heard, that is, they say...
487491 491518 Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.<br />The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
491595 493290 Now do we get those waltzes?
493530 494861 Of course.
495766 499998 - The other boys will be hopping mad.<br />- Let them be mad. We can handle them!
500604 502834 It can't be true. Ashley loves me.
502906 504066 Scarlett!
504474 506101 What has gotten into her?
506176 507939 Do you suppose we made her mad?
508011 511845 Where are you going without your shawl,<br />and the night air fixing to set in?
511915 514577 How come you didn't ask them gentlemen<br />to stay for supper?
514651 516846 You ain't got no more manners<br />than a field hand...
516920 519115 after me and Miss Ellen done labored<br />with you.
519189 521589 Miss Scarlett, come on in the house!
521658 523956 Come on in before you catch<br />your death of dampness.
524027 526689 No! I'll wait for Pa to come home<br />from the Wilkes'.
526763 528355 Come on in here!
528932 530399 Come on!
545549 546880 Quitting time.
546950 548349 Who says it's quitting time?
548418 549578 I says it's quitting time.
549653 553054 I's the foreman. I's the one that says<br />when it's quitting time at Tara!
553123 554715 Quitting time!
555158 557092 Quitting time!
598034 601299 There's none in the county can touch you,<br />and none in the state.
602672 603696 Pa!
604007 606305 So proud of yourself you are.
608512 610377 Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara.
610447 613883 So you've been spying on me,<br />and like your sister Suellen...
613950 616384 you'll tell your mother on me<br />that I was jumping again.
616453 619616 You know I'm no tattletale like Suellen,<br />but it does seem to me...
619689 622681 after you broke your knee last year<br />jumping that same fence...
622759 627093 I'll not have me own daughter telling me<br />what I shall jump and not jump.
627163 628687 It's my own neck, so it is.
628832 632700 All right, Pa, you jump what you please.<br />How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?
632769 633793 The Wilkeses?
633870 637966 Just as you'd expect with the barbecue<br />tomorrow and talking nothing but war.
638041 640805 Oh, bother the war.<br />Was there anyone else there?
640877 644244 Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta, and her brother, Charles.
644314 645576 Melanie Hamilton!
645649 647981 She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny.<br />I hate her.
648051 649541 Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
649619 652645 Ashley Wilkes couldn't like<br />anyone like her.
653156 655590 What's your interest in Ashley<br />and Miss Melanie?
656860 659055 It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.
659129 662292 Has he been trifling with you?<br />Has he asked you to marry him?
662365 663798 - No!<br />- No, nor will he.
663867 667098 I have it in strictest confidence<br />from John Wilkes this afternoon...
667170 668865 Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.
668939 671499 It will be announced tomorrow night<br />at the ball.
672075 673565 I don't believe it.
673743 675870 Here! Here, where are you off to?
676112 677101 Scarlett!
678048 679879 What are you about?
680317 683081 Have you made a spectacle of yourself<br />running after a man...
683153 686384 who's not in love with you when<br />you might have any man in the county?
686456 689857 I haven't been running after him.<br />It's just a surprise, that's all.
689926 692759 Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.
692829 696321 If Ashley wanted to marry you,<br />it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes. "
696399 699891 I want my girl to be happy.<br />You'd not be happy with him.
700003 701231 I would, I would!
701304 703272 What difference does it make<br />who you marry...
703340 705808 so long as he's a Southerner<br />and thinks like you?
705875 708105 And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.
708178 710772 I don't want Tara.<br />Plantations don't mean anything when...
710847 715409 You mean to say, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,<br />that land doesn't mean anything to you?
715485 718352 Why, land is the only thing in the world<br />worth working for...
718421 722221 worth fighting for, worth dying for,<br />because it's the only thing that lasts.
722292 725819 - Oh, Pa, you talk like an Irishman.<br />- It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
725895 729456 And don't you be forgetting, missy,<br />that you're half Irish too.
729532 731932 And to anyone with a drop of Irish blood<br />in them...
732002 734232 why, the land they live on<br />is like their mother.
734304 738866 Oh, but you're just a child.<br />It'll come to you, this love of the land.
738942 741308 There's no getting away from it<br />if you're Irish.
766236 767260 Yonder she comes!
767337 770135 Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,<br />your ma's home!
770206 773107 Acting like a wet nurse<br />to them low-down, poor white trash...
773176 776668 instead of being here eating her supper.<br />Cookie, stir up the fire!
776746 779237 Miss Ellen's got no business<br />wearing herself out.
779783 782251 Take the lamp out on the porch.<br />Wearing herself out.
782318 784411 Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.
784487 786819 Wearing herself out<br />waiting on poor white trash.
786890 788983 Shut up, dog!<br />Barking in the house like that.
789059 791755 Get up from there, boy.<br />Don't you hear Miss Ellen's coming?
791828 794160 Get out there and get her medicine chest.
794531 796829 We was getting worried about you,<br />Miss Ellen.
796900 799528 - Mr. Gerald...<br />- All right, Pork. I'm home.
799969 803632 Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing<br />the creek bottom today.
803707 806301 What do you want me<br />to start on tomorrow?
806376 810107 Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come<br />from Emmie Slattery's bedside.
810246 811804 Your child has been born.
811915 815146 My child, ma'am?<br />I'm sure I don't understand.
815318 817650 Has been born, and mercifully, has died.
818521 820182 Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
823560 825960 I'll fix your supper for you myself,<br />and you eats it.
826029 827155 After prayers, Mammy.
827230 828356 Yes, ma'am.
829566 830897 Mr. O'Hara.
831468 833095 You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
833169 836730 Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?<br />He's the best overseer in the county.
836806 838865 He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.
838942 840034 But...
841511 842603 - No!<br />- Yes.
844013 846743 The Yankee Wilkerson<br />and the white trash Slattery girl?
846816 848784 We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
848885 849977 Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
855759 857454 I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!
857527 860223 I don't like your tone, Suellen.<br />Your pink gown is lovely.
860296 863993 - Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?<br />- But you may wear my garnets with it.
864067 866592 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
866669 868330 Scarlett...
868404 870964 you look tired, my dear.<br />I'm worried about you.
871875 873206 I'm all right, Mother.
873309 875539 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
875612 876704 I'm 13 now.
876780 879476 You may go to the barbecue<br />and stay up till supper.
879549 881847 I didn't want to wear<br />your tacky green dress anyhow.
881918 882942 Oh, hush up!
883019 884509 Prayers, girls.
891194 896097 "And to all the saints, that I have sinned<br />exceedingly in thought, word and deed...
896466 897763 "through my fault.
897967 901130 "Through my fault,<br />through my most grievous fault.
901604 904937 "Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary,<br />ever Virgin...
905074 907338 "Blessed Michael, the Archangel...
907510 909410 "Blessed John the Baptist...
909479 911743 "the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...
912415 915407 "and all the saints<br />to pray to the Lord, our God, for me. "
915518 917577 Ashley doesn't know I love him.
918788 922451 I'll tell him that I love him<br />and then he can't marry her.
923726 926752 "May the Almighty,<br />and most merciful Lord...
926830 928593 "grant us pardon, absolution...
929232 930756 "and remission of our sins. Amen. "
933469 936029 Just hold on and suck in.
936873 939137 Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.
939375 941809 You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.
941878 943470 Oh, yes, ma'am, you is!
943580 945844 You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.
946916 948941 No, I'm not!
951688 953747 Put on the dress, 'cause we're late already.
953823 955723 - What's my lamb gonna wear?<br />- That.
955792 959819 No you ain't! You can't show your bosom<br />before 3:00.
959963 961863 I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!
961931 965298 If you say one word to Mother,<br />I won't eat a bite.
969339 970363 Well...
977046 980345 Keep your shawl on.<br />I ain't aiming for you to get all freckled...
980416 984546 after the buttermilk I done put on you<br />all this winter, bleaching them freckles.
990827 994763 Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on<br />and be good, and eat just a little, honey.
994831 995889 No.
996199 999999 I'm going to have a good time today<br />and do my eating at the barbecue.
1000169 1003002 If you don't care what folks says<br />about this family, I does!
1003072 1006337 I has told you and told you<br />that you can always tell a lady...
1006409 1008536 by the way she eats with folks. Like a bird.
1008611 1010738 I ain't aiming for you to go to Mr. Wilkes'...
1010813 1013043 and eat like a field hand<br />and gobble like a hog!
1013116 1014447 Fiddle-dee-dee.
1014851 1018184 Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl<br />with a healthy appetite.
1018254 1021246 What gentlemen says and<br />what they thinks is two different things.
1021324 1024316 And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley<br />asking to marry you!
1040443 1044379 Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need<br />of having it come right back up again.
1046916 1049851 Why does a girl have to be so silly<br />to catch a husband?
1050086 1054955 Scarlett, if you're not here by the time<br />I count ten, we'll be going without you!
1055191 1056419 I'm coming, Pa!
1056559 1057617 One...
1057694 1059321 two, three...
1060029 1062088 four, five, six...
1063066 1064192 Oh, dear!
1064467 1068198 My stays are so tight I know I'll never<br />get through the day without belching.
1093096 1096793 Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day<br />you'll be having for the barbecue.
1096866 1099801 So it seems, Gerald.<br />But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
1099869 1101996 She's after settling accounts<br />with the overseer.
1102105 1103936 But she'll be along for the ball tonight.
1104007 1105838 Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
1105908 1107933 Thank you kindly, India.
1108011 1110707 Your daughter's getting prettier every day,<br />John.
1111247 1114045 India, here are the O'Hara girls.<br />We must greet them.
1114117 1117553 I can't stand Scarlett. If you see<br />the way she throws herself at Ashley.
1117620 1119645 Now, that's your brother's business.
1119722 1122350 You must remember your duties<br />as hostess.
1122425 1124655 Good morning, girls. You're looking lovely.
1125228 1126855 Good morning, Scarlett.
1127430 1129921 Why, India Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
1130133 1133364 - Perfectly lovely, darling.<br />- I just can't take my eyes off it.
1135304 1136362 Scarlett, honey...
1136439 1138430 You're looking mighty fine this morning.
1138508 1140806 - Good morning, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good morning.
1141411 1143436 - It's a pleasure to see you.<br />- Good morning.
1143513 1144741 Howdy, Miss Scarlett.
1146249 1147273 Ashley!
1149752 1151310 Scarlett, my dear.
1152889 1155016 I've been looking for you everywhere.
1155091 1157059 I've got something I must tell you.
1157226 1160718 - Can't we go some place where it's quiet?<br />- Yes, I'd like to, but I...
1160930 1162795 I have something to tell you, too.
1162865 1165629 Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
1166636 1169036 But come say hello<br />to my cousin Melanie, first.
1169105 1170697 Oh, do we have to?
1171007 1173840 She's been looking forward<br />to seeing you again.
1173943 1174967 Melanie!
1176179 1177703 Here's Scarlett.
1178147 1179136 Scarlett!
1180650 1182277 I'm so glad to see you again.
1182351 1185343 Melanie Hamilton!<br />What a surprise to run into you here.
1185621 1187714 I hope you'll stay with us<br />a few days at least.
1187790 1191248 I hope I shall stay long enough for us<br />to become real friends, Scarlett.
1191327 1192658 I do so want us to be.
1192728 1194525 We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?
1194597 1197031 We'll just have to make<br />the biggest fuss over her.
1197100 1200331 If there's anybody knows how to give<br />a girl a good time, it's Ashley.
1200403 1204237 Though I expect our good times will seem<br />silly to you because you're so serious.
1204307 1206867 Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
1206943 1208433 I've always admired you so.
1208511 1210138 I wish I could be more like you.
1210213 1213148 You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,<br />and say things you don't mean.
1213216 1216617 Nobody could accuse Melanie<br />of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
1217220 1219279 Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?
1219355 1221755 Ashley never means a word he says<br />to any girl.
1222325 1225817 Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,<br />you handsome old thing, you!
1225895 1227362 But, oh, Miss O'Hara, I...
1227430 1229864 Was it kind to bring<br />your good-looking brother here...
1229932 1232423 just to break my poor, simple,<br />country girl's heart?
1232502 1234470 She never even noticed Charles before.
1234537 1237005 Because he's your beau,<br />she's after him like a hornet.
1237073 1239541 Charles Hamilton,<br />I want to eat barbecue with you.
1239609 1243409 Mind you, don't go philandering with<br />any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.
1243479 1244878 I won't, Miss O'Hara!
1245348 1246610 I couldn't!
1247116 1249812 I do declare, Frank Kennedy,<br />if you don't look dashing...
1249886 1251217 with that new set of whiskers!
1251287 1253778 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
1254223 1256953 Charles and Rafe asked me<br />to eat barbecue with them...
1257026 1259290 but I told them I couldn't<br />because I promised you.
1259362 1262957 You needn't be so amused. Look at her!<br />She's after your beau now!
1263366 1266164 Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1266702 1268693 I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.
1268905 1271465 What's your sister so mad about?<br />You sparking her beau?
1271541 1274601 As if I couldn't get a better beau<br />than that old maid in britches.
1274677 1278204 Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome<br />old things, you! No, you're not!
1278281 1279805 I won't say that. I'm mad at you!
1279882 1280871 What have we done?
1280950 1283384 You haven't been near me all day.<br />I wore this dress...
1283452 1284680 'cause I thought you liked it.
1284754 1286813 I was counting on eating barbecue<br />with you two.
1286889 1289084 - Well, you are, Scarlett.<br />- Of course you are.
1289158 1293094 Oh, I never can make up my mind<br />which of you two is the handsomer.
1293429 1296592 I was awake all last night<br />trying to figure it out.
1302171 1303900 Cathleen, who's that?
1303973 1304997 Who?
1305074 1307099 That man looking at us and smiling.
1307476 1308670 The nasty, dark one.
1308778 1312805 My dear, don't you know?<br />That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.
1312882 1315009 He has the most terrible reputation.
1319855 1323086 He looks as if he knows<br />what I look like without my shimmy!
1323159 1324217 Scarlett!
1324594 1326391 Why, my dear, he isn't received!
1326662 1328220 He spends a lot of time up North...
1328297 1330925 because his folks in Charleston<br />won't even speak to him.
1331000 1333332 He was expelled from West Point,<br />he's so fast.
1333402 1336667 And then there's that business<br />about that girl he wouldn't marry.
1336739 1337763 Tell, tell!
1337940 1342172 Well, he took her out buggy riding<br />in the late afternoon without a chaperon!
1342745 1345236 And then he refused to marry her!
1348851 1351445 No, but she was ruined just the same.
1357193 1358717 Ashley!
1358894 1359986 Happy?
1360096 1361085 So happy!
1362832 1364959 You seem to belong here...
1365401 1367835 as if it had all been imagined for you.
1369238 1371638 I like to feel that I belong<br />to the things you love.
1371707 1373299 You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
1373376 1374434 Yes, Ashley.
1374844 1376334 I love it as...
1376412 1377936 as more than a house.
1378581 1382574 It's a whole world that wants only<br />to be graceful and beautiful.
1382718 1384879 It's so unaware that it may not last...
1385621 1386713 forever.
1386789 1390054 You're afraid of what may happen<br />if the war comes, aren't you?
1390192 1392786 But we don't have to be afraid for us.
1393362 1395830 No war can come into our world, Ashley.
1396832 1398129 Whatever comes...
1398834 1401564 I'll love you, just as I do now...
1402338 1403464 until I die.
1408444 1410309 Isn't this better than sitting at a table?
1410379 1412847 A girl hasn't got but two sides to her<br />at a table.
1414250 1415342 I'll go get her dessert.
1415418 1417818 - Here, she said me.<br />- Allow me, Miss O'Hara.
1420056 1421250 I think...
1424560 1427358 I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
1428964 1430625 Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!
1431167 1432395 Thank you.
1432635 1433761 Go get it.
1433936 1436063 Isn't he the luckiest?
1443379 1444403 Miss O'Hara...
1445948 1446937 I love you.
1448551 1450951 I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
1454357 1457155 Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.
1457426 1459758 Well-brought-up young ladies<br />take naps at parties.
1459829 1463788 It's high time you started behaving and<br />acting like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
1463866 1467267 When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice<br />any Yankee girls taking naps.
1467336 1471204 No, and you ain't gonna see<br />no Yankee girls at the ball tonight, neither.
1471374 1472966 How was Ashley today, Scarlett?
1473042 1475636 He didn't seem to be paying<br />much attention to you.
1475711 1477406 You mind your own business!
1477480 1479880 You'll be lucky not to lose<br />old whisker-face Kennedy.
1479949 1481382 You've liked Ashley for months!
1481450 1484078 Pa said that his engagement's<br />gonna be announced tonight.
1484153 1485518 That's all you know.
1486021 1488546 Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!<br />You all behave yourselves.
1488624 1490319 Acting like poor white trash children!
1490393 1493885 If you's old enough to go to parties,<br />you's old enough to act like ladies.
1493963 1495089 Who cares!
1546282 1548807 We've borne enough insults<br />from the meddling Yankees.
1548884 1551546 It's time we made them understand<br />we'll keep our slaves...
1551620 1552951 with or without their approval.
1553022 1556423 'Twas Georgia's sovereign right<br />to secede from the Union!
1556492 1557481 That's right!
1557560 1560051 The South must assert herself<br />by force of arms.
1560129 1564293 After we've fired on the Yankee rascals<br />at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!
1564467 1566833 - There's no other way!<br />- Fight! That's right. Fight!
1566902 1568631 Let the Yankees ask for peace!
1568704 1572333 The situation is very simple.<br />The Yankees can't fight and we can.
1573375 1574808 There won't even be a battle.
1574877 1576504 They'll just turn and run every time.
1576579 1578376 One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.
1578447 1580278 We'll finish them in one battle.
1580349 1582374 Gentlemen can always fight better<br />than rabble.
1582451 1584851 Yes, gentlemen always can fight better<br />than rabble.
1584920 1587081 What does the captain of our troop say?
1587256 1590692 Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights,<br />I go with her.
1591126 1594789 But, like my father, I hope the Yankees<br />will let us leave the Union in peace.
1594864 1597128 - But, Ashley...<br />- But, Ashley, they've insulted us!
1597199 1598666 You can't mean you don't want war!
1598734 1602170 Most of the miseries of the world<br />were caused by wars.
1602271 1606264 And when the wars were over<br />no one ever knew what they were about.
1606342 1607809 If it wasn't that I knew you...
1607877 1611904 Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been<br />up North, I hear.
1612047 1614106 Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?
1614650 1617210 I think it's hard winning a war with words,<br />gentlemen.
1617286 1618685 What do you mean, sir?
1618821 1621585 There's not a cannon factory<br />in the whole South.
1621657 1623682 What difference does that make<br />to a gentleman?
1623759 1627024 Lt'll make a great deal of difference<br />to a great many gentlemen, sir.
1627096 1629860 Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,<br />that the Yankees can lick us?
1629932 1630990 No, I'm not hinting.
1631066 1634297 I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees<br />are better equipped than we.
1634370 1636634 They've got factories, shipyards,<br />coal mines...
1636705 1639538 and a fleet to bottle up our harbors<br />and starve us to death.
1639608 1642941 All we've got is cotton and slaves<br />and arrogance.
1643012 1646539 - That's treacherous!<br />- I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
1646782 1648306 I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
1648384 1650682 Apologies aren't enough, sir!
1650753 1653654 I hear you were turned out of West Point,<br />Mr. Rhett Butler...
1653722 1657954 and you aren't received by any decent<br />family in Charleston, not even your own!
1662398 1665367 I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
1667002 1670028 Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about<br />and look over your place.
1670105 1673404 I seem to be spoiling<br />everybody's brandy and cigars and...
1673676 1674938 dreams of victory.
1682151 1685678 That's just about what you could expect<br />from somebody like Rhett Butler.
1685754 1687551 You did everything but call him out.
1687623 1688783 He refused to fight.
1688857 1691655 Not quite that, Charles.<br />He refused to take advantage of you.
1691727 1692751 Take advantage of me?
1692828 1696286 He's one of the best shots in the country,<br />as he's proved several times...
1696365 1698162 against steadier hands and cooler heads.
1698233 1699427 - I'll show him!<br />- No, please.
1699501 1702026 Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
1702104 1704937 You may be needed<br />for more important fighting, Charles.
1705240 1707674 Now, if you'll excuse me,<br />Mr. Butler is our guest.
1707743 1709836 I think I'll just show him around.
1722591 1723683 Ashley!
1731300 1732858 Ashley!
1733235 1734293 Scarlett.
1736171 1738366 Who are you hiding from in here?
1743646 1745341 What are you up to?
1747383 1750409 Well, why aren't you upstairs<br />resting with the other girls?
1751720 1753745 What is this, Scarlett? A secret?
1754156 1756522 Oh, Ashley, Ashley...
1757192 1758352 I love you.
1758661 1759685 Scarlett!
1759762 1761229 I love you, I do!
1763632 1767295 Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered<br />every other man's heart today?
1767369 1769769 You've always had mine.<br />You cut your teeth on it.
1769838 1771465 Oh, don't tease me now.
1771540 1774338 Have I your heart, my darling?<br />I love you, I love you.
1774410 1778039 You mustn't say such things.<br />You'll hate me for hearing them.
1778147 1782311 Oh, I could never hate you,<br />and I know you must care about me.
1782718 1784845 Oh, you do care, don't you?
1786088 1787214 Yes...
1787723 1788849 I care.
1790359 1793226 Oh, can't we go away and forget<br />we ever said these things?
1795064 1796725 But how can we do that?
1797066 1799296 Don't you want to marry me?
1799435 1800959 I'm going to marry Melanie.
1801103 1803469 But you can't. Not if you care for me.
1803639 1806767 Oh, my dear, why must you make me<br />say things that will hurt you?
1807676 1809735 How can I make you understand?
1810446 1811936 You're so young and unthinking.
1812014 1813538 You don't know what marriage means.
1813615 1816049 I know I love you<br />and I want to be your wife.
1816151 1817584 You don't love Melanie.
1817786 1819253 She's like me, Scarlett.
1819655 1822385 She's part of my blood<br />and we understand each other.
1822691 1824556 But you love me.
1824793 1826420 How could I help loving you?
1826929 1829329 You have all the passion for life that I lack.
1829398 1832094 That kind of love isn't enough<br />for a successful marriage...
1832167 1833828 for two people as different as we are.
1833902 1836996 Well, why don't you say it, you coward?<br />You're afraid to marry me.
1837072 1839632 You'd rather live with that fool<br />who can't speak except...
1839708 1843405 to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel<br />of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.
1843479 1845242 You mustn't say such things<br />about Melanie.
1845314 1846679 Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
1846749 1849513 You led me on, you made me believe<br />you wanted to marry me.
1849585 1851917 Now, Scarlett, be fair.<br />I never, at any time...
1851987 1855514 You did, it's true you did!<br />I'll hate you till I die!
1856125 1859424 I can't think of anything bad enough<br />to call you.
1886421 1888286 Has the war started?
1888891 1892292 Sir, you should have made<br />your presence known.
1892594 1894755 In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
1894963 1897158 That wouldn't have been very tactful,<br />would it?
1897232 1899792 But don't worry,<br />your secret is safe with me.
1900335 1901495 Sir, you are no gentleman!
1901570 1903697 And you, miss, are no lady.
1904173 1906004 Don't think I hold that against you.
1906074 1907803 Ladies have never held any charm for me.
1907876 1910902 First you take a low, common advantage<br />of me, then you insult me.
1910979 1914415 I meant it as a compliment<br />and I hope to see more of you...
1914483 1917316 when you're free of the spell<br />of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.
1917386 1921652 He doesn't strike me as half good enough<br />for a girl of your... What was it?
1921890 1923357 Your "passion for living. "
1923559 1926187 How dare you!<br />You aren't fit to wipe his boots.
1927596 1930588 And you were going to hate him<br />for the rest of your life.
1933068 1937061 She certainly made a fool of herself<br />running after all the men at the barbecue.
1937139 1938800 That's not fair, India.
1938874 1941638 She's so attractive,<br />the men just naturally flock to her.
1941710 1943644 Oh, Melanie, you're just too good<br />to be true.
1943712 1946078 Didn't you see her<br />going after your brother Charles?
1946148 1948116 Yes, and she knows<br />Charles belongs to me.
1948183 1949810 Oh, you're wrong, India.
1949885 1952945 Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
1953322 1955984 Men may flirt with girls like that<br />but they don't marry them.
1956058 1958253 I think you're being very mean to her.
1966902 1969871 War! War's declared! War!
1981550 1982949 Miss O'Hara!
1985988 1987148 Miss O'Hara!
1987422 1990721 Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,<br />volunteers to fight against us.
1990792 1993386 Don't you men ever think<br />about anything important?
1993462 1995623 But it's war and everybody's going off<br />to enlist.
1995697 1997460 They're going right away. I'm going, too.
1997532 1998590 Everybody?
2002905 2005305 Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
2005540 2007167 To see us go, I mean.
2007843 2009777 I'll cry into my pillow every night.
2009912 2011903 Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
2012080 2016483 You're the most beautiful girl in the world,<br />and the sweetest and the dearest.
2016618 2018916 I know I couldn't hope<br />that you could love me.
2018987 2022445 I'm so clumsy and stupid<br />and not nearly good enough for you.
2022524 2026392 But if you could think of marrying me,<br />I'd do anything in the world for you.
2026461 2027985 Just anything. I promise.
2028530 2029792 What did you say?
2029998 2032831 Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?
2038473 2040441 Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
2041109 2043373 You will? You'll marry me?<br />You'll wait for me?
2043812 2045143 I don't think I'd want to wait.
2045213 2047647 You mean you'll marry me before I go?
2048150 2050118 Oh, Miss O'Hara.
2050185 2051914 Scarlett...
2053522 2055012 When may I speak to your father?
2055090 2056148 The sooner the better.
2056224 2057782 I'll go now. I can't wait.
2057859 2059759 Will you excuse me, dear?
2064700 2066565 Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.
2066635 2068728 It'll be a week at least<br />before they call on me.
2068804 2071932 Only a week, and then they'll take you<br />away from me.
2104940 2107568 Scarlett, I thought of you<br />at our wedding yesterday...
2107642 2110736 and I hoped that yours would be<br />as beautiful, and it was.
2111380 2112404 Was it?
2112814 2115248 Now we're really and truly sisters.
2115917 2117407 - Charles.<br />- Melanie.
2125327 2128455 Don't cry, darling.<br />The war will be over in a few weeks...
2128530 2130657 and I'll be coming back to you.
2174576 2175736 Miss Scarlett!
2176812 2179975 Well, I don't care.<br />I'm too young to be a widow.
2180348 2181645 Miss Scarlett!
2183218 2185846 Why, I'd just go around scaring people<br />in that thing.
2186888 2189550 You ain't supposed to be around people.<br />You's in mourning.
2189624 2191922 For what? I don't feel anything.
2192527 2195189 Why should I have to pretend<br />and pretend...
2195831 2197230 What is it?
2198100 2200227 Oh, baby...
2201503 2202834 What is it?
2202904 2204303 My life is over.
2204639 2207199 Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.
2209644 2210975 Oh, Mother.
2211046 2215540 I know you'll think I'm horrible,<br />but I just can't bear going around in black.
2215884 2218478 It's bad enough not being able<br />to go to any parties...
2218553 2220180 but looking this way, too.
2220255 2222155 I don't think you're at all horrible.
2222224 2226354 It's only natural to want to look young<br />and be young when you are young.
2226728 2228457 Oh, baby...
2229431 2231399 How would you like<br />to go visiting somewhere?
2231466 2232626 Savannah, perhaps?
2232701 2234760 What would I do in Savannah?
2234936 2236528 Well, Atlanta, then.
2236838 2238863 There's lots going on there.
2238940 2242034 And you could stay<br />with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
2242811 2243971 Melanie.
2244479 2245571 Yes.
2246381 2247643 Yes, I could, couldn't I?
2247716 2250844 Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,<br />sweeter than anybody in the world.
2250986 2252351 You'd like it, really?
2252854 2256119 All right then.<br />Now stop your crying and smile.
2257959 2259620 You can take Prissy with you.
2260195 2262561 Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,<br />Mammy.
2262898 2264798 I'll go write the necessary letters.
2267802 2268791 Atlanta!
2268870 2272237 Savannah would be better for you.<br />You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.
2272307 2273831 What trouble are you talking about?
2273909 2277606 You know what trouble I's talking about.<br />I's talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.
2277679 2279806 He'll come to Atlanta<br />when he gets his leave...
2279881 2282406 and you're sitting there<br />waiting for him like a spider!
2282484 2285817 - He belongs to Miss Melanie...<br />- You go pack my things like Mother said.
2306841 2309605 They're all whispering,<br />and I just know it's about her.
2309678 2311669 What's it matter what they say,<br />Aunt Pittypat?
2311746 2316376 But Scarlett is living under my roof,<br />so they all think I'm responsible for her.
2316484 2320215 And for a widow to appear in public<br />at a social gathering!
2320288 2322916 Every time I think of it I feel faint!
2323091 2327323 Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here<br />only to help raise money for the cause.
2327395 2330455 It was splendid of her<br />to make the sacrifice.
2330599 2332328 Anyone would think, to hear you talk...
2332400 2335892 that she came here to dance<br />instead of to sell things.
2348250 2349979 Ladies and gentlemen!
2350051 2352747 I have important news! Glorious news!
2353121 2356215 Another triumph<br />for our magnificent men in arms.
2356958 2360189 General Lee has completely<br />whipped the enemy...
2360262 2364255 and swept the Yankee Army<br />northward from Virginia.
2373375 2376503 And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
2376978 2381108 We have with us tonight that most daring<br />of all blockade-runners...
2381483 2385044 whose fleet schooners,<br />slipping past the Yankee guns...
2385120 2388954 have brought us here the very woolens<br />and laces we wear tonight.
2389157 2393218 I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that<br />will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main.
2393428 2396226 None other than our friend<br />from Charleston...
2396531 2398089 Capt. Rhett Butler!
2419054 2420453 Permit me.
2424759 2427956 Capt. Butler, it's such a pleasure<br />to see you again.
2428263 2430288 I met you last at my husband's home.
2430398 2432628 That's kind of you to remember,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2433034 2435662 Did you meet Capt. Butler<br />at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
2435737 2437830 Yes, I think so.
2438106 2440734 Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />It was in the library.
2440809 2442709 You had broken something.
2443812 2446246 Yes, Capt. Butler, I remember you.
2446314 2450341 Ladies, the Confederacy asks for<br />your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.
2450418 2452477 We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.
2452554 2453816 Wait.
2454422 2456788 On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br />and Mrs. Hamilton.
2457826 2459157 Thank you, Capt. Butler.
2459461 2461088 Just a moment, please.
2463898 2465923 But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
2466334 2469633 It may help my husband more,<br />off my finger.
2470271 2471397 Thank you.
2473875 2476435 That's a very beautiful thing to do,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2476945 2478003 Here.
2478279 2480839 You can have mine, too, for the cause.
2483118 2486986 And you, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />I know just how much that means to you.
2487222 2488587 - Melanie!<br />- Yes, Dr. Meade.
2488656 2491056 I need your approval,<br />as a member of the Committee...
2491126 2493651 for something we want to do<br />that's rather shocking.
2494162 2496062 Will you excuse us, please?
2498199 2501862 I'll say one thing. The war makes<br />the most peculiar widows.
2502137 2503297 I wish you'd go away.
2503371 2506568 If you had any raising you'd know<br />I'd never want to see you again.
2509444 2510911 Now, why be silly?
2510979 2515143 You've no reason for hating me.<br />I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
2516851 2520446 I guess I'd be very unpatriotic<br />to hate one of the great heroes of the war.
2520522 2524288 I do declare I was surprised to see you<br />turn out to be such a noble character.
2524359 2527851 I can't bear to take advantage<br />of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.
2527929 2529988 I'm neither noble nor heroic.
2530198 2531529 But you are a blockade-runner?
2531599 2533658 For profit, and profit only.
2533868 2536098 Are you telling me<br />you don't believe in the cause?
2536171 2538799 I believe in Rhett Butler.<br />He's the only cause I know.
2538873 2540204 The rest doesn't mean much to me.
2543812 2545780 And now, ladies and gentlemen...
2545880 2548849 I have a startling surprise<br />for the benefit of the hospital.
2550618 2554748 Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening<br />reel with the lady of your choice...
2555056 2556785 you must bid for her.
2558293 2561353 Caroline Meade, how can you permit<br />your husband to conduct this...
2561429 2563056 this slave auction?
2563131 2565691 Dolly Merriwether,<br />how dare you criticize me!
2566067 2567625 Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...
2567702 2570671 that if it's for the benefit of the cause,<br />it's quite all right.
2570738 2571932 She did!
2572006 2575032 Oh dear, oh dear.<br />Where are my smelling salts?
2575410 2576672 I think I shall faint.
2576744 2579076 Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.
2579247 2581841 If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
2583084 2585882 Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?<br />Make your offers.
2586821 2588482 Don't be bashful, gentlemen.
2589290 2593192 $20. $20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.
2593328 2595523 $25 for Miss Fanny Elsing.
2595597 2597724 Only $25 to give your...
2597866 2599925 $150 in gold.
2600468 2601662 For what lady, sir?
2601769 2603737 For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2606641 2607733 For whom, sir?
2608243 2609801 Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2609878 2612039 Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,<br />Capt. Butler...
2612146 2614910 but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles<br />would be proud to...
2614983 2618441 Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2619254 2621449 She will not consider it, sir.
2621689 2623020 Oh, yes, I will.
2635270 2638171 Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.
2639574 2641599 We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.
2641676 2643610 It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?
2643678 2644667 It's worse.
2644746 2646680 But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
2646748 2648875 I don't care what you expect<br />or what they think.
2648950 2650247 I'm going to dance and dance.
2650318 2653344 Tonight I wouldn't mind<br />dancing with Abe Lincoln himself.
2685186 2687780 Another dance and my reputation<br />will be lost forever.
2687855 2690255 With enough courage,<br />you can do without a reputation.
2690325 2691792 Oh, you do talk scandalous.
2700201 2702465 You do waltz divinely, Capt. Butler.
2702704 2706504 Don't start flirting with me.<br />I'm not one of your plantation beaux.
2706641 2708871 I want more than flirting from you.
2709410 2711037 What do you want?
2711479 2715848 I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take<br />that Southern belle simper off your face.
2716718 2718242 Some day I want you to say to me...
2718319 2721152 the words I heard you say<br />to Ashley Wilkes:
2721522 2722682 "I love you. "
2723224 2727456 That's something you'll never hear from<br />me, Capt. Butler, as long as you live.
2748049 2750244 How sweet, how kind.
2750318 2752286 He is a thoughtful gentleman.
2752353 2756084 Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say<br />something about my sacrifice?
2763998 2766091 Oh, the darling thing.
2766167 2768101 Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.
2768269 2771363 You didn't really bring it all the way<br />from Paris just for me.
2771439 2774897 Yes, I thought it was about time<br />I got you out of that fake mourning.
2775209 2778269 Next trip, I'll bring you some green silk<br />for a frock to match it.
2778346 2779370 Oh, Rhett.
2779781 2784718 It's my duty to our brave boys at the front<br />to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
2785420 2787854 Oh, it's so long<br />since I've had anything new.
2798566 2799624 How do I look?
2800935 2802766 Awful! Just awful.
2803104 2804366 Why, what's the matter?
2804472 2805996 This war has stopped being a joke...
2806074 2809339 when a girl like you doesn't know<br />how to wear the latest fashion.
2814382 2817044 Oh, Rhett, let me do it.
2822490 2825391 But, Rhett, I don't know<br />how I'd dare wear it.
2826260 2827386 You will, though.
2828229 2830720 And another thing. Those pantalets.
2830832 2833733 I don't know a woman in Paris<br />who wears pantalets anymore.
2833868 2834960 Oh, what do they...
2835536 2837663 You shouldn't talk about such things.
2837739 2838728 You little hypocrite.
2838806 2841331 You don't mind my knowing about them,<br />just my talking.
2841409 2845243 I really can't go on accepting these gifts,<br />though you are awfully kind.
2845313 2847247 I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.
2847315 2851183 I never give anything without expecting<br />something in return. I always get paid.
2851252 2853948 If you think I'll marry you to pay<br />for the bonnet, I won't.
2854021 2856387 Don't flatter yourself.<br />I'm not a marrying man.
2856991 2859687 Well, I won't kiss you for it, either.
2870037 2871800 Open your eyes and look at me.
2873241 2875175 No, I don't think I will kiss you...
2875243 2876938 although you need kissing badly.
2877011 2878342 That's what's wrong with you.
2878412 2881347 You should be kissed, and often.<br />And by someone who knows how.
2881415 2884077 Oh, and I suppose you think<br />you're the proper person.
2884152 2886950 I might be, if the right moment ever came.
2887455 2890151 You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,<br />Rhett Butler.
2890224 2892954 And I don't know why<br />I let you come and see me.
2893294 2894921 I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
2894996 2897191 Because I'm the only man over 16<br />and under 60...
2897265 2899563 who's around to show you a good time.
2899634 2902194 But cheer up,<br />the war can't last much longer.
2902336 2903803 Really, Rhett? Why?
2903871 2907500 There's a battle going on right now<br />that ought to pretty well fix things...
2907575 2908633 one way or the other.
2908709 2910609 Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
2912113 2915480 You haven't gotten the wooden-headed<br />Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
2915550 2916881 Yes, I suppose he's in it.
2916951 2918942 Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?
2919253 2922416 Some little town in Pennsylvania<br />called Gettysburg.
2951886 2953854 Casualty list.
3003871 3004963 Here you is, Miss Melanie.
3005039 3007735 They was fighting for them,<br />so it just got tore in half.
3008009 3010807 Scarlett, you look. The "W's" at the end.
3014715 3018082 "Wellman, Wendell, White,<br />Whitner, Wilkins...
3018753 3019947 "Williams, Woolsey, Workman. "
3020021 3022285 Scarlett, you've passed him.
3022890 3024721 Oh, he isn't there!
3024792 3025781 He isn't there!
3025860 3028055 Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.
3028129 3030290 Oh, he's safe, he's safe.
3032133 3036126 Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet<br />to worry about Ashley like this for me.
3043577 3045010 I must go to her.
3046480 3048311 Don't, my dear, not here.
3049283 3050545 Let's go home.
3052053 3053748 Dr. Meade, not...
3053821 3056483 Yes, our boy, Darcy.
3057258 3059954 I was making these mittens for him.
3060561 3062392 He won't need them now.
3063264 3066859 Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show them.<br />I'll kill all those Yankees.
3066934 3068299 Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.
3068369 3071532 You think it'll help your mother<br />to have you off getting shot, too?
3071605 3073163 I never heard of anything so silly.
3075743 3078871 It's a black day, Scarlett.<br />You haven't had bad news, have you?
3079013 3080173 Ashley's safe.
3080247 3081942 I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
3082016 3083608 Rhett, there are so many others.
3083684 3084708 Any of your friends?
3084785 3088516 Just about every family in the county.<br />The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.
3088589 3092286 Yes, look at them.<br />All these poor tragic people.
3093127 3096654 The South's sinking to its knees.<br />It'll never rise again.
3097431 3098762 The cause...
3099066 3102194 The cause of living in the past<br />is dying right in front of us.
3102370 3104338 I never heard you talk like that before.
3104405 3108569 I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.<br />And that's what all this is, sheer waste.
3110778 3112302 But don't you be downcast.
3112613 3116049 Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home<br />to the women who love him...
3116384 3117783 both of them.
3154522 3156046 Oh, you're here.
3159460 3162429 Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.
3162730 3164925 Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.
3165132 3167532 Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.
3171472 3173531 Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.
3175042 3176339 Scarlett, dear.
3178779 3182545 Well, is this any way to greet<br />a returning warrior?
3182883 3184407 Ashley, I...
3187588 3189556 Merry Christmas, Ashley.
3197832 3201632 Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br />We've got all your wives.
3202403 3204303 We've got all your little chicks.
3204371 3207499 You got nobody to worry your head<br />about leaving.
3207908 3208966 Come on.
3209343 3213746 Now you just stand still so you can be<br />a Christmas gift for the white folks.
3214215 3215546 Now hold on.
3215950 3217008 Hold on!
3217751 3219776 Don't go getting so uppity...
3219854 3222254 even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.
3224625 3226957 Let's not talk about the war.<br />It's Christmas.
3227261 3230958 Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara,<br />and all the times before the war.
3231031 3232555 Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?
3232633 3235033 Why did you say there wasn't enough,<br />Uncle Peter?
3235102 3238629 There's plenty. It's the very last<br />of my father's fine Madeira.
3238839 3242741 He got it from his uncle,<br />Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
3242843 3246176 who married his cousin,<br />Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...
3246380 3250009 who was his second cousin once removed<br />and a kin to the Wilkeses, too.
3250117 3253518 I saved it to wish Ashley<br />a Merry Christmas.
3254288 3257985 But you mustn't drink it all at once<br />because it is the last.
3262796 3265560 I meant it, my dear.<br />It was a lovely Christmas gift.
3265933 3268299 Only generals have tunics like this<br />nowadays.
3268369 3270132 I'm so happy you like it, dear.
3270204 3272001 Where did you get the cloth?
3272072 3274199 It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.
3274275 3278905 I nursed her son while he was in<br />the hospital, Ashley, before he died and...
3278979 3281607 Oh, you will take good care of it,<br />won't you?
3281682 3283775 You won't let it get torn.
3284218 3285276 Promise me.
3285352 3286512 You mustn't worry.
3287021 3290422 I'll bring it back to you<br />without any holes in it, I promise.
3293427 3294451 Good night, my dear.
3294528 3296792 Good night, Scarlett, darling.
3309710 3312110 Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,<br />for Mr. Ashley to leave?
3312179 3314044 Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
3314114 3317572 She isn't going to the depot with him?<br />She hasn't changed her mind?
3317651 3319380 No, ma'am. She's laying down.
3319453 3323685 She's so upset Mr. Wilkes told her<br />she can't even come downstairs.
3329863 3330955 Ashley!
3335202 3337966 Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
3338472 3341635 Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you<br />as you are now...
3341709 3343609 not shivering at the depot.
3343677 3344871 All right.
3345879 3348848 Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.
3355923 3358187 Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.
3358525 3360390 Tie it on me, my dear.
3361595 3365463 While Melly was making your new tunic,<br />I made this to go with it.
3366066 3367863 You made it yourself?
3368369 3371202 Well, then I shall value it all the more.
3371405 3374465 You know there's nothing<br />I wouldn't do for you.
3375442 3377239 There's something you can do for me.
3377311 3378676 What is it?
3378912 3381472 Will you look after Melanie for me?
3382049 3385416 She's so frail and gentle<br />and she loves you so much.
3385486 3387010 You see, if I were killed and she...
3387087 3390921 Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.<br />Say a prayer quickly.
3390991 3392390 You say one for me.
3393560 3396927 We shall need all our prayers<br />now the end is coming.
3397131 3398120 The end?
3398198 3399961 The end of the war.
3400601 3403126 And the end of our world, Scarlett.
3403404 3406703 But, Ashley, you don't think<br />the Yankees are beating us?
3406774 3409743 Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...
3410844 3413244 and the snow in Virginia is deep.
3413847 3415542 When I see them...
3415683 3420017 and I see the Yankees coming<br />and coming, always more and more...
3423023 3426186 Well, when the end does come<br />I shall be far away.
3426727 3429958 It'll be a comfort to me to know<br />that she has you.
3430331 3432458 You will promise, won't you?
3435069 3436127 Yes.
3437404 3439235 Is that all, Ashley?
3440040 3442770 All except goodbye.
3443310 3445369 Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.
3445446 3446606 - You must be brave...<br />- No...
3446680 3447977 You must.
3448282 3450273 How else can I bear going?
3451318 3454947 Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine<br />and strong and beautiful.
3456156 3458681 Not just your sweet face, my dear...
3459059 3460424 but you.
3463864 3466059 Ashley, kiss me.
3466600 3468261 Kiss me goodbye!
3474708 3475970 No, Scarlett.
3476043 3477977 Oh, Ashley, I love you.
3478212 3481375 I've always loved you.<br />I've never loved anyone else.
3481448 3484076 I only married Charles just to hurt you.
3484151 3486517 Ashley, tell me you love me.
3487321 3489881 I'll live on it the rest of my life.
3491692 3492954 Goodbye.
3512746 3514976 When the war is over, Ashley.
3515816 3517750 When the war is over.
3538235 3540601 And there's a place back home...
3540771 3544366 where a wild plum tree comes to flower<br />in the springtime.
3545242 3547301 Down by the creek, you know.
3547378 3549175 Yes, I know, I know.
3549880 3553441 When we were little,<br />my brother Jeff and I used to...
3553517 3556953 I told you about my brother Jeff,<br />didn't I, ma'am?
3557288 3558812 I know I did.
3558923 3560049 He...
3560324 3563157 We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
3563594 3566893 Since Bull Run we haven't heard<br />anything and...
3567431 3569865 Please, we must have<br />your temperature now.
3569934 3572402 Just take this in your mouth<br />and not talk anymore.
3572470 3573903 Not just now.
3574405 3577203 Melanie, I'm so tired. I've got to go home.
3578342 3580401 Aren't you tired, Melanie?
3580644 3582805 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3583848 3585406 This might be...
3585483 3586677 Ashley.
3587251 3590118 And only strangers here to comfort him.
3590554 3592681 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3593758 3595453 They could all be...
3595926 3597188 Ashley.
3609440 3613536 I've been sitting by this curb one solid<br />hour waiting to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.
3613611 3616307 Go on, you trash,<br />don't you be pestering these ladies.
3616380 3617904 Don't talk to her, Melly.
3617982 3620348 It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?
3620418 3622943 My name's Belle Watling.<br />But that don't matter.
3623054 3625249 I expect you think<br />I've got no business here.
3625322 3627984 Hadn't you best tell me<br />what you want to see me about?
3628059 3631290 First time I come here, I says,<br />"Belle, you're a nurse. "
3631362 3633626 But the ladies didn't want<br />my kind of nursing.
3633697 3635688 Well, they was more than likely right.
3635766 3637893 Then I tried giving them money.
3637968 3640198 My money wasn't good enough<br />for them, either.
3640271 3641602 Old peahens!
3642173 3644733 I know a gentleman<br />who says you're a human being.
3644809 3648540 If you are, which they ain't,<br />you'll take my money for the hospital.
3648612 3651706 What are you doing here?<br />Haven't you been told twice already?
3651782 3653773 This time I'm conversing with Miss Wilkes.
3653851 3655944 You might as well take my money,<br />Miss Wilkes.
3656020 3658045 It's good money, even if it is mine.
3658122 3659714 I'm sure you're very generous.
3659790 3663123 No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate<br />like everybody else, that's all.
3663194 3664718 Of course you are.
3664795 3667059 Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
3667131 3670225 But maybe they ain't<br />as good Christians as you.
3676974 3679704 Look, Mrs. Meade.<br />It's a great deal of money.
3680044 3682205 $10, $20, $30, $50.
3682513 3685311 And it's not our paper money. It's gold.
3685483 3687417 Let me see that handkerchief.
3687485 3688713 "R. B."
3690955 3694152 And she's driving away<br />in Rhett Butler's carriage!
3695192 3699060 Oh, if I just wasn't a lady<br />what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
3733130 3735963 "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
3736200 3739135 "He maketh me to lie down<br />in green pastures.
3739236 3740794 "He leadeth...
3742606 3744471 "He restoreth my soul.
3744875 3748902 "He leadeth me in the paths<br />of righteousness for his name's sake.
3749113 3752674 "Yeah, though I walk through the valley<br />of the shadow of death...
3752750 3754581 "I will fear no evil.
3754652 3756176 "For thou art with me.
3756253 3759086 "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "
3759690 3760748 Yankees!
3761325 3764419 Yankees!<br />Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
3764495 3767953 They'll never get into Atlanta. They'll<br />never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.
3768032 3769693 We'll be safe in the hospital.
3769867 3772097 Give me something for the pain.
3772770 3774431 Give me something for the pain!
3774505 3777633 Sorry, son, we haven't got anything<br />to give you.
3778742 3781176 These animals is driving me crazy!
3781837 3783998 What luck! You've got my jack!
3784073 3786667 Give me an ace and I'll start another war!
3786742 3788403 I'll bid the moon!
3792314 3796375 I'll never see you or Pa again.
3797353 3799082 This leg's got to come off, soldier.
3799154 3801486 No, no! Leave me alone!
3801590 3802716 I'm sorry, soldier.
3802791 3804725 We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.
3804793 3806454 Then we'll have to operate without it.
3806528 3808325 No, no! Leave me alone!
3808397 3810661 You can't do it. I won't let you do it to me!
3810733 3813964 Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off<br />immediately. It's gangrene.
3814036 3816095 No, no! Don't!
3816171 3818901 I haven't seen my family in three days.
3818974 3821306 I'm going home for half an hour.
3821410 3822968 Orderly! Give me a lift.
3827116 3829346 Nurse, you can free this bed.
3830352 3831876 Miss Scarlett!
3833522 3835217 Why, Frank Kennedy!
3835290 3837349 Miss Suellen, is she well?
3837559 3840722 When did they bring you in?<br />You all right? Are you badly hurt?
3840796 3843390 - But Miss Suellen, is she...<br />- She's all right, but I...
3843465 3845365 Dr. Wilson needs you<br />in the operating room.
3845434 3848426 He's going to take off that leg.<br />Better hurry.
3849705 3851138 I'll be back.
3852741 3855232 No, no, leave me alone!
3855677 3858441 No, no, I can't stand it!
3858881 3861509 No don't! Don't cut!
3862284 3863615 Don't cut!
3864186 3865983 Don't, don't!
3866355 3867481 Please!
3867890 3869585 Where's the nurse?
3874163 3875187 Dr. Wilson's waiting.
3875264 3877459 Let him wait! I'm going home!<br />I've done enough.
3877533 3881025 I don't want any more men dying!<br />I don't want any more!
3942164 3943392 Big Sam!
3944399 3946367 Big Sam! Big Sam!
3947469 3949960 Almighty Moses, it's Miss Scarlett!
3950038 3951198 Big Sam!
3951740 3952866 Big Sam!
3952941 3956308 Sam, 'Lige, 'Postel, Prophet!<br />I'm so glad to see you!
3956378 3959074 Tell me about Tara, about my mother.<br />She didn't write me.
3959147 3961206 - She's gone and got sick, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Sick?
3961283 3962773 Just a little bit sick, that's all.
3962851 3966446 Your pa was wild when they wouldn't<br />let him fight 'cause of his broken knee.
3966522 3970652 He had fits when they took us field hands<br />to dig ditches for white soldiers to hide in.
3970726 3972557 But your ma says<br />the Confederacy needs us.
3972628 3974061 So we's gonna dig for the South.
3974129 3975255 Sam, was there a doctor?
3975330 3976456 Ma'am, we've got to march.
3976532 3979365 Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
3979434 3983131 Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.<br />If any of you get sick or hurt, let me know.
3983205 3984638 - Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Goodbye.
3984706 3986367 - Goodbye.<br />- Goodbye.
4006528 4007688 Scarlett!
4007863 4009057 Scarlett!
4012367 4015427 Climb into this buggy.<br />This is no day for walking.
4015504 4016732 You'll get run over.
4016805 4018033 Oh, Rhett!
4018507 4020737 Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
4022311 4024711 Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
4027549 4030143 That's just another of Gen. Sherman's<br />calling cards.
4030218 4031549 He'll be paying us a visit soon.
4031620 4034384 I've got to get out of here<br />before the Yankees come!
4034456 4036390 And leave your work at the hospital?
4036458 4040258 Or have you had enough of death and lice<br />and men chopped up?
4040329 4042627 I suppose you weren't meant<br />for sick men, Scarlett.
4042698 4044723 Don't talk to me like that. I'm so scared.
4044800 4046859 I wish I could get out of here.
4046935 4048368 Let's get out of here together.
4048437 4051668 No use staying here and letting the South<br />come down around your ears.
4051740 4054538 There are too many nice places<br />to go and visit.
4054610 4056908 Mexico, London, Paris...
4056979 4058844 - With you?<br />- Yes, ma'am.
4059147 4062583 With a man who understands you<br />and admires you for just what you are.
4062651 4065745 I figure we belong together,<br />being the same sort.
4066121 4070785 I've been waiting for you to grow up and<br />get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.
4070859 4075296 Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have<br />a baby in another month or so.
4075364 4079323 It'll be hard loving a man<br />with a wife and baby clinging to him.
4081737 4085798 Well, here we are. Are you going with me,<br />or are you getting out?
4086108 4090909 I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler,<br />and I'll hate and despise you till I die.
4091613 4094480 Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long.
4102024 4103548 Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
4103625 4107322 Folks is all going to Macon and folks is<br />running away and running away.
4107396 4110763 I can't bear it!<br />Those cannon balls right in my ears!
4110832 4113062 I faint every time I hear one!
4114002 4116334 Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk!
4116405 4118032 But, Aunt Pitty, you aren't leaving?
4118106 4120438 I may be a coward, but oh, dear!
4120942 4122876 Yankees in Georgia!
4123078 4124170 How did they ever get in?
4124246 4126976 I'm going, too. Prissy, go pack my things.<br />Get them, quick!
4127049 4128812 Wait, Aunt Pitty, I won't be a minute.
4128884 4130852 Scarlett, do you really think you ought to?
4130919 4131977 Scarlett!
4132054 4135023 What is this?<br />You ain't planning on running away?
4135090 4138548 And don't you dare try to stop me.<br />I'm never going back to that hospital.
4138627 4141653 I've had enough of smelling death<br />and rot and death.
4141730 4144824 I'm going home. I want my mother.<br />My mother needs me.
4144900 4147596 Now you've got to listen to me.<br />You must stay here!
4147669 4150661 Without a chaperon, Dr. Meade?<br />It simply isn't done!
4150739 4153299 Good heavens, woman, this is war,<br />not a garden party!
4153375 4155002 You've got to stay. Melanie needs you.
4155077 4156135 Oh, bother Melanie.
4156211 4158702 She's ill already.<br />She shouldn't even be having a baby.
4158780 4160008 She may have a difficult time.
4160082 4161310 Can't we take her along?
4161383 4162873 Do you want her to take that chance?
4162951 4164509 To be jounced over rough roads...
4164586 4166520 and have her baby ahead of time,<br />in a buggy?
4166588 4168453 It isn't my baby! You take care of her!
4168523 4170388 Scarlett! We haven't enough doctors...
4170459 4172757 much less nurses<br />to look after a sick woman.
4172828 4174352 You've got to stay for Melanie.
4174429 4175418 What for?
4175530 4177498 I don't know anything about babies<br />being born!
4177566 4179158 I knows, I knows.
4179234 4182067 I knows how to do it.<br />I's done it lots and lots.
4182137 4185106 Let me, Doctor, let me.<br />I can do everything.
4185173 4188267 - Good. Then I'll rely on you to help us.<br />- Yes, Doctor.
4188343 4191574 Ashley's fighting in the field,<br />fighting for the cause.
4191646 4194171 He may never come back. He may die.
4194883 4197408 Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.
4197919 4198977 Ashley.
4199054 4201579 If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
4201957 4203549 I promised Ashley...
4203625 4204717 something.
4204793 4206317 Then you'll stay?
4206762 4209890 Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.<br />Scarlett's staying.
4209965 4213162 Go on, Uncle Peter.<br />Oh, dear, I don't know what to do.
4213268 4215759 It's like the end of the world.
4216538 4219974 Uncle Peter, my smelling salts.
4226748 4229046 Melanie, it's all your fault!
4229618 4231609 I hate you, I hate you!
4231686 4233483 And I hate your baby!
4233588 4235920 If only I hadn't promised Ashley!
4235991 4238221 If only I hadn't promised him!
4267289 4269655 Stop! Stop, please stop!
4269724 4271316 Is it true? Are the Yankees coming?
4271393 4273384 I'm afraid so, ma'am.<br />The Army's pulling out.
4273461 4275691 Pulling out of Atlanta?<br />Leaving us to the Yankees?
4275764 4277231 Not leaving, ma'am, evacuating.
4277299 4280427 We've got to before Sherman cuts<br />the McDonough Road and catches us.
4280502 4283403 It can't be true! It can't be true!<br />What'll I do?
4283471 4287635 Better refugee south right quick, ma'am.<br />If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
4288376 4289570 Prissy!
4290512 4292139 Prissy, come here!
4292214 4295672 Pack my things and Miss Melanie's, too.<br />We're going to Tara right away.
4295750 4296808 The Yankees are coming!
4296885 4298079 Yes, ma'am.
4299688 4300712 Scarlett!
4301323 4302347 Scarlett!
4302757 4304918 Melly, we're going to...
4307095 4308187 Melly!
4310832 4314165 I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.
4316705 4318935 It began at daybreak.
4319474 4320941 But, but...
4321743 4323870 But the Yankees are coming.
4325013 4326537 Poor Scarlett.
4327048 4330176 You'd be at Tara now with your mother,<br />wouldn't you...
4330986 4332817 if it weren't for me?
4333455 4335286 Oh, Scarlett, darling...
4335690 4337590 you've been so good to me.
4337692 4340160 No sister could have been sweeter.
4343398 4345730 I've been lying here thinking...
4346501 4348196 if I should die...
4349237 4351262 will you take my baby?
4353575 4355600 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
4355677 4358612 Aren't things bad enough<br />without you talking about dying?
4359047 4361948 - I'll send for Dr. Meade right away.<br />- Not yet, Scarlett.
4362017 4365418 I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here<br />for hours, while...
4365654 4369681 - while all those poor, wounded boys...<br />- Prissy!
4370725 4372989 Prissy! Prissy! Come here, quick!
4373061 4374528 Go get Dr. Meade! Run, quick!
4374596 4376962 Yes, ma'am. The baby!
4377666 4380794 Well, don't stand there like a scared goat.<br />Run!
4382537 4386530 Hurry! I'll sell you South, I will!<br />I swear I will!
4388276 4390039 Where's that Prissy?
4393081 4395174 This room's like an oven already...
4395250 4397184 and it isn't noon yet.
4400021 4401818 Oh, don't worry, Melly.
4402357 4406020 Mother says it always seems<br />like the doctor will never come.
4407228 4409924 If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
4417272 4418500 Oh, Melly.
4419174 4421768 You know what I heard<br />about Maybelle Merriwether?
4421843 4424038 You remember that funny-looking beau<br />of hers?
4424112 4427445 The one with a uniform<br />like ladies' red flannel underdrawers.
4427515 4431042 You don't have to keep on talking<br />for my sake, Scarlett.
4431286 4433254 I know how worried you are.
4446501 4450164 Oh, Melly, I'll just go and fetch you<br />some cool water.
4451740 4453332 You're as slow as molasses in January.
4453408 4454966 And where's Dr. Meade?
4455043 4457375 - I ain't never seen him, Miss Scarlett.<br />- What?
4457445 4459811 No, ma'am. He ain't at the hospital.
4459881 4464750 A man, he told me the doctor's down at<br />the car shed with the wounded soldiers...
4464919 4467285 Well, why didn't you go after him?
4467655 4468849 Miss Scarlett.
4468923 4471915 I's scared to go down there<br />to the car shed.
4472260 4476196 There's folks dying down there<br />and I's scared of dead folks.
4478333 4480028 Oh, you go sit by Miss Melly.
4480101 4483935 And don't you be upsetting her,<br />or I'll whip the hide off you!
4521810 4524404 - Have you seen Dr. Meade?<br />- Side, lady, please.
4528349 4529680 Dr. Meade!
4574329 4576058 Dr. Meade! At last!
4576197 4579496 Oh, thank heavens you're here.<br />I need every pair of hands.
4579567 4582468 Come, child! Wake up!<br />We've got work to do.
4582837 4586364 But Melly's having her baby.<br />You've got to come with me!
4586474 4589341 Are you crazy?<br />I can't leave these men for a baby!
4589410 4592243 They're dying, hundreds of them!<br />Get some woman to help you.
4592313 4595407 But there isn't anybody.<br />Dr. Meade, she might die!
4595483 4596541 Die!
4596618 4599553 Look at them!<br />Bleeding to death in front of my eyes!
4599621 4603819 No chloroform! No bandages!<br />Nothing! Nothing to even ease their pain!
4604259 4606625 Now run along and don't bother me.
4606694 4609993 Now don't worry, child.<br />There's nothing to bringing a baby.
4610064 4611554 Now bring those stretchers in here!
4611633 4612622 Dr. Meade!
4612700 4614258 I'm coming.
4633454 4635012 Is the doctor come?
4635657 4637090 No, he can't come.
4637158 4639956 Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.
4640094 4642688 He can't come. There's nobody to come.
4643398 4646925 Prissy, you've got to manage<br />without the doctor. I'll help you.
4647001 4648798 Oh, lordy, Miss Scarlett.
4650004 4651301 Well, what is it?
4651372 4653636 Lordy, we've got to have a doctor.
4653708 4656541 I don't know nothing<br />about birthing babies.
4657879 4659710 - What do you mean?<br />- I don't know...
4659781 4661612 You told me you knew everything about it.
4661683 4663742 I don't know how come I told such a lie.
4663818 4667345 Ma ain't never let me around<br />when folks was having them.
4667755 4668847 Scarlett!
4669457 4670583 Scarlett!
4671292 4673089 Oh, Miss Scarlett...
4673761 4674989 Stop it!
4676497 4677930 Go light a fire in the stove!
4677999 4680968 Keep boiling water in the kettle,<br />get me the ball of twine and...
4681035 4683560 and all the clean towels you can find,<br />and the scissors.
4683638 4685469 Don't come telling me you can't find them.
4685540 4687701 Go get them, and get them quick!
4688910 4690172 Scarlett!
4699420 4700751 Coming, Melly.
4701856 4703050 Coming.
4706894 4709192 Go, Scarlett, before the Yankees get here.
4709264 4711255 I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.
4711332 4713027 It's no use. I'm going to die.
4713101 4716298 Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me.<br />Hold on to me.
4716371 4718566 Talk to me, Scarlett.
4718640 4720767 Please talk to me.
4720942 4722239 Don't try to be brave, Melly.
4722310 4724710 Yell all you want, there's nobody to hear.
4724779 4729113 Ma says that if you puts a knife<br />under the bed, it cuts the pain in two.
4734522 4736285 Capt. Butler!
4737158 4738455 Capt. Butler!
4740228 4741252 Who do you want?
4741329 4742318 Capt. Butler.
4742397 4745059 He's upstairs. Belle Watling's<br />giving a party.
4747302 4748496 Thank you.
4750838 4753272 Capt. Butler! Oh, Capt. Butler!
4753508 4755567 What's all the rumpus about?
4755743 4758940 I's got a message for Capt. Butler,<br />Miss Watling!
4759147 4762605 Capt. Butler, you come out here<br />in the streets to me.
4763818 4764910 What is it, Prissy?
4764986 4767477 Miss Scarlett, she done sent me for you.
4767655 4770385 Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.
4770892 4773793 A fine baby boy...
4774262 4777026 and Miss Scarlett and me, we brung him.
4777098 4778759 Do you mean to tell me that Scarlett...
4778833 4782428 Well, it was mostly me, Capt. Butler,<br />only Miss Scarlett...
4782503 4787372 she helped me a little, but I don't expect<br />no doctor could have done no better!
4787675 4791805 Only Miss Melly, she feeling kind of poorly<br />now it's all over!
4792980 4794277 Yes, I can believe that!
4794349 4797944 And the Yankees is coming,<br />and Miss Scarlett, she said...
4799220 4801950 Oh, Capt. Butler, the Yankees is here!
4802623 4805888 Please come and bring your carriage<br />for us right away.
4806027 4808825 I'm sorry, Prissy, but the Army<br />took my horse and carriage.
4808896 4811228 You'd better come upstairs.<br />I'll see what I can do.
4811299 4812857 Oh, no, Capt. Butler!
4813134 4817764 Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk<br />if I was to go into Miss Watling's.
4819040 4822669 Any of you beauties know where I can<br />steal a horse for a good cause?
4829584 4832417 - Whoa, Marse Robert.<br />- Is that you, Rhett?
4832687 4835713 - We's here, Miss Scarlett. We's here!<br />- Rhett, I knew you'd come.
4835790 4837621 Good evening. Nice weather we're having.
4837692 4839853 Prissy tells me you're planning<br />on taking a trip.
4839927 4841952 If you make any jokes now, I'll kill you!
4842029 4843360 Don't tell me you're frightened.
4843431 4847390 I'm scared to death. If you had the sense<br />of a goat, you'd be scared too.
4847468 4849459 - Oh, the Yankees.<br />- No, not yet.
4849537 4852267 That's what's left of our Army,<br />blowing up the ammunition...
4852340 4853466 so the Yankees won't get it.
4853541 4855236 We've got to get out of here.
4855309 4856298 At your service, madam.
4856377 4857969 Just where are you figuring on going?
4858045 4859069 Home, to Tara.
4859147 4861377 They've been fighting all day around Tara.
4861449 4863883 Do you think you can parade<br />through the Yankee Army...
4863951 4866419 with a sick woman,<br />a baby, and a simple-minded darky...
4866487 4868148 or do you intend leaving them behind?
4868222 4870747 They're going with me. I'm going home.<br />You can't stop me!
4870825 4874556 Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing<br />Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?
4874629 4876062 I want my mother!
4876931 4878831 I want to go home to Tara!
4878900 4880697 Tara's probably been burned<br />to the ground.
4880768 4882963 The woods are full of stragglers<br />from both armies.
4883037 4885403 The least they'll do is take the horse<br />away from you.
4885473 4888067 It isn't much of an animal,<br />but I had trouble stealing it.
4888142 4891202 I'm going home if I have to walk<br />every step of the way.
4891279 4894476 I'll kill you if you try to stop me.<br />I will, I will!
4894982 4896074 I will!
4901889 4905416 All right, darling, all right.<br />Now you shall go home.
4907295 4910753 I guess anybody who did what you've done<br />today can take care of Sherman.
4912366 4914698 Here, now. Stop crying.
4917205 4919503 Now blow your nose like a good little girl.
4919774 4920934 There.
4932653 4933745 Prissy! What are you doing?
4933821 4935254 I's packing, Miss Scarlett.
4935323 4936790 Stop it and come get the baby.
4936991 4937980 Yes, ma'am.
4940628 4941754 Melly!
4942763 4945596 Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.
4945833 4946891 Tara...
4946968 4948833 - It's the only way, Melly.<br />- No.
4948903 4951633 Sherman will burn the house<br />over our heads if we stay.
4951906 4953339 It's all right, Melly.
4953407 4954965 My baby.
4955576 4957100 My poor baby.
4961649 4964083 Have you the strength to put your arms<br />around my neck?
4964151 4965914 I think so.
4968723 4969985 Never mind.
4970057 4972423 Oh, Ashley, Charles...
4972493 4974085 What is it? What does she want?
4974161 4976994 Ashley's picture, Charles' sword.<br />She wants us to bring them.
4977064 4978088 Get them.
4994048 4995106 What's that?
4995349 4998648 Our gallant lads must have set fire<br />to the warehouses near the depot.
4998719 5001586 There's enough ammunition<br />in the boxcars to blow us to Tara.
5001656 5003624 We'll have to hurry<br />to get across the tracks.
5003691 5005420 - You're not going that way!<br />- We have to.
5005493 5008656 The McDonough Road's the only one<br />the Yankees haven't cut yet.
5017905 5020339 Oh, wait. I forgot to lock the front door.
5020474 5021771 What are you laughing at?
5021842 5023969 At you, locking the Yankees out.
5041028 5042655 Oh, dear, I wish they'd hurry.
5042730 5045460 I wouldn't be in such a hurry<br />to see them go if I were you.
5045533 5048001 With them goes the last semblance<br />of law and order.
5050371 5052532 The scavengers aren't wasting any time.
5057011 5058740 We've got to get out of here fast.
5058813 5060041 There's a horse!
5071525 5073186 Down the alley, cut them off.
5087174 5088869 Give me that horse.
5099053 5100077 Miss Scarlett!
5104425 5107053 They haven't left much for the Yankees<br />to take, have they?
5107128 5110586 We'll have to make a dash for it<br />before the fire reaches that ammunition.
5131752 5132810 Come on!
5137324 5138985 Throw me your shawl.
5141662 5145223 Sorry, but you'll like it better<br />if you don't see anything.
5204592 5206583 Take a good look, my dear.
5207027 5208051 It's a historic moment.
5208129 5209596 You can tell your grandchildren...
5209663 5212894 how you watched the old South<br />disappear one night.
5229250 5231650 They were going to lick the Yankees<br />in a month.
5231719 5233550 Poor gallant fools!
5233621 5234986 They make me sick, all of them!
5235055 5238183 Getting us all into this<br />with their swaggering and boasting.
5238526 5241859 That's the way I felt once<br />about their swaggering and boasting.
5242730 5245096 Rhett, I'm so glad<br />you aren't with the Army.
5245166 5249432 You can be proud now, proud that you've<br />been smarter than all of them.
5251839 5253306 I'm not so proud.
5272760 5273818 Why did you stop?
5273894 5276624 This is the turn to Tara.<br />Let the horse breathe a bit.
5276997 5278021 Mrs. Wilkes.
5278098 5281397 Miss Melly done fainted way back,<br />Capt. Butler.
5281602 5283160 Well, she's probably better off.
5283237 5286297 She couldn't stand the pain<br />if she were conscious.
5286807 5289674 Scarlett, are you still determined<br />to do this crazy thing?
5289743 5292576 Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.<br />I'm sure we can.
5292646 5294477 Not we, my dear. You.
5294849 5296316 I'm leaving you here.
5296617 5299211 You're what? Rhett, where are you going?
5299453 5301683 I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.
5301889 5304517 You're joking!<br />I could kill you for scaring me so!
5304592 5306321 I'm very serious, Scarlett.
5306393 5309123 I'm going to join up<br />with our brave lads in gray.
5309196 5310322 But they're running away!
5310397 5313696 No. They'll turn and make a last stand,<br />if I know anything about them.
5313767 5316895 When they do, I'll be with them.<br />A little late, but "Better late... "
5316971 5318700 Rhett, you must be joking!
5319740 5321264 Selfish to the end, aren't you?
5321342 5325244 Thinking only of your own precious hide,<br />with never a thought for the noble cause.
5325312 5327075 Rhett, how could you do this to me...
5327147 5330082 and why should you go now,<br />after it's all over and I need you?
5330150 5331139 Why? Why?
5331218 5332242 Why?
5332319 5335311 Maybe it's because I've always had<br />a weakness for lost causes...
5335389 5336686 once they're really lost.
5336757 5337849 Or maybe...
5339093 5341118 maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
5342363 5343352 Who knows?
5343430 5346297 You should die of shame<br />to leave me here alone and helpless!
5346600 5348067 You helpless?
5349136 5351900 Heaven help the Yankees<br />if they capture you!
5352439 5355499 Now climb down here.<br />I want to say goodbye.
5355843 5356832 No!
5357444 5358809 Climb down.
5362182 5365515 Oh, Rhett, please don't go.<br />You can't leave me, please.
5365586 5367315 I'll never forgive you!
5367388 5371415 I'm not asking you to forgive me.<br />I'll never understand or forgive myself.
5371492 5375929 And if a bullet gets me, so help me,<br />I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
5376163 5377790 But there's one thing I do know...
5377865 5379492 and that is that I love you, Scarlett.
5379566 5383058 In spite of you, me and the whole<br />silly world going to pieces around us...
5383137 5384229 I love you...
5384305 5386830 because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.
5387207 5389004 Selfish and shrewd...
5389343 5392710 but able to look things in the eyes<br />and call them by their right names.
5392780 5394680 Don't hold me like that!
5394782 5396613 Scarlett, look at me.
5397785 5400219 I love you<br />more than I've ever loved any woman.
5400354 5403585 And I've waited longer for you<br />than I've ever waited for any woman.
5403657 5404851 Let me alone!
5406026 5408551 Here's a soldier of the South<br />who loves you, Scarlett...
5408629 5410256 wants to feel your arms around him...
5410331 5413198 wants to carry the memory<br />of your kisses into battle with him.
5413267 5414894 Never mind about loving me.
5414969 5418735 You're a woman sending a soldier<br />to his death with a beautiful memory.
5419006 5420803 Scarlett, kiss me.
5421942 5423307 Kiss me, once.
5428649 5431117 You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!
5431418 5435218 They were right! Everybody was right!<br />You aren't a gentleman!
5437992 5440153 A minor point at such a moment.
5441962 5443054 Here.
5443697 5445995 If anyone lays a hand on that nag,<br />shoot him.
5446066 5448000 But don't make a mistake<br />and shoot the nag.
5448068 5452198 Oh, go on. I want you to go.<br />I hope a cannonball lands slap on you.
5452272 5454069 I hope you're blown into a million pieces!
5454141 5457042 Never mind the rest.<br />I follow your general idea.
5457111 5459204 And when I'm dead on the altar<br />of my country...
5459279 5461611 I hope your conscience hurts you.
5462182 5463615 Goodbye, Scarlett.
5489643 5492237 Come on, you! We're going home.
5567988 5569979 Oh, my poor baby.
5571892 5573325 Don't worry, Melly.
5573560 5575687 Mother will take care of him<br />when we get home.
5575762 5578560 Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.
5578799 5580596 We's got to have something to eat.
5580667 5581929 Oh, hush up!
5582336 5585328 We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.<br />We'll stop there.
5586106 5587266 Go on!
5654374 5657366 Ashley, I'm glad you're not here<br />to see this.
5658679 5660374 The Yankees!
5660447 5662381 The dirty Yankees!
5677030 5679521 Prissy, come tie up this cow!
5680033 5682399 We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
5682469 5685529 We'll be home soon,<br />and I's scared of cows.
5686139 5689165 Tear up your petticoat and tie her<br />on to the back of the wagon.
5689409 5693038 We need milk for the baby, and<br />we don't know what we'll find at home.
5702289 5704280 Melly! Melly, we're home!
5704491 5705515 We're at Tara!
5705592 5707457 Hurry! Move, you brute!
5709062 5711496 Miss Scarlett, he's dead!
5711965 5716231 I can't see the house! Is it there?<br />I can't see the house. Have they burned it?
5719973 5721600 Oh, it's all right.
5721675 5724007 It's all right! They haven't burned it!
5724344 5725675 It's still there!
5729349 5731909 Mother! Mother! I'm home.
5734655 5736646 Mother! Mother! I'm home.
5742162 5745097 Mother, let me in. It's me, Scarlett!
5749603 5750695 Pa!
5751338 5752805 Oh, Pa!
5753540 5754871 I'm home!
5756376 5757468 I'm home!
5760547 5761946 Katie.
5762716 5764240 Katie Scarlett.
5765218 5767015 Oh, darling.
5778198 5779392 Mammy!
5780467 5783903 - Mammy, I'm home.<br />- Honey, honey child!
5785706 5787799 Oh, Mammy, I'm so...
5789476 5791000 Where's Mother?
5791511 5792535 Why...
5793113 5796708 Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen,<br />they was sick with the typhoid.
5797451 5800284 They had it bad,<br />but they's doing all right now.
5800620 5802087 Just weak like little kittens.
5802155 5804123 But where's Mother?
5805826 5806952 Well...
5807527 5812430 Miss Ellen, she went down to nurse<br />that Emmie Slattery, that white trash...
5813133 5815158 and she took down with it, too.
5817504 5819904 - And last night, she...<br />- Mother!
5823543 5824771 Mother.
5892712 5894179 Miss Scarlett, honey.
5894247 5896977 If there's anything I can do,<br />Miss Scarlett...
5897851 5899375 What did you do with Miss Melly?
5899453 5902047 Don't you worry your pretty head<br />about Miss Melly, child.
5902122 5904955 I done slapped her in bed already,<br />along with the baby.
5905025 5907493 You better put that cow I brought<br />into the barn, Pork.
5907561 5909859 There ain't no barn no more, Miss Scarlett.
5909963 5911897 The Yankees done burned it for firewood.
5911965 5914092 They used the house<br />for their headquarters.
5914167 5915828 They camped all around the place.
5915902 5917369 Yankees in Tara!
5917437 5920372 Yes, ma'am, and they stole<br />most everything they didn't burn.
5920440 5924501 All the clothes and all the rugs<br />and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
5926746 5928714 I'm starving, Pork.<br />Get me something to eat.
5928782 5931979 There ain't nothing to eat, honey.<br />They took it all.
5932319 5933877 All the chickens, everything?
5934020 5935715 They took them the first thing.
5935789 5938724 And what they didn't eat<br />they carried off across their saddles.
5938792 5941556 Don't tell me any more<br />about what they did!
5957444 5959435 What's this, Pa?
5959513 5960605 Whiskey?
5961081 5962343 Yes, daughter.
5966386 5968513 Katie Scarlett, that's enough!
5968588 5971921 You're not knowing spirits,<br />you'll make yourself tipsy.
5971992 5973892 I hope it makes me drunk.
5974194 5975786 I'd like to be drunk.
5978932 5980058 Oh, Pa.
5983503 5985368 What are those papers?
5986306 5987432 Bonds.
5989309 5991004 They're all we've saved.
5991077 5992669 All we have left.
5993213 5994407 Bonds.
5994814 5996543 What kind of bonds, Pa?
5997617 6000177 Why, Confederate bonds,<br />of course, daughter.
6000353 6002014 Confederate bonds.
6002322 6004552 What good are they to anybody?
6004791 6007453 I'll not have you talking like that,<br />Katie Scarlett.
6007661 6011722 Oh, Pa, what are we going to do<br />with no money and nothing to eat?
6013199 6015167 We must ask your mother.
6015902 6017233 That's it!
6017671 6019901 We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
6021408 6023137 - Ask Mother?<br />- Yes.
6024044 6026604 Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.
6027714 6029614 Now don't be bothering me.
6029683 6031446 Go out for a ride.
6032085 6033347 I'm busy.
6051338 6052896 Oh, Pa...
6053640 6055733 don't worry about anything.
6056543 6058408 Katie Scarlett's home.
6060814 6062475 You needn't worry.
6077597 6078621 Miss Scarlett.
6078698 6082634 What are we gonna to do with nothing<br />to feed those sick folks and that child?
6084170 6085762 I don't know, Mammy.
6086606 6087732 I don't know.
6087807 6090867 We ain't got nothing but radishes<br />in the garden.
6090944 6094004 Miss Scarlett,<br />Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...
6094080 6096446 they's fussing to be sponged off.
6097150 6098708 Where are the other servants, Mammy?
6098785 6101345 Miss Scarlett, there's only<br />just me and Pork left.
6101421 6103685 The others went off to the war<br />or runned away.
6103757 6106988 I can't take care of that baby<br />and sick folks, too.
6107861 6109624 I's only got two hands.
6110063 6114432 Who's going to milk that cow,<br />Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.
6197450 6199418 As God is my witness...
6199986 6203285 As God is my witness,<br />they're not going to lick me.
6203723 6208592 I'm going to live through this, and when<br />it's all over, I'll never be hungry again.
6208962 6210623 No, nor any of my folks.
6212198 6214758 If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill.
6216069 6219937 As God is my witness,<br />I'll never be hungry again!
6651076 6653169 My back's near broken.
6655581 6657310 Look at my hands.
6658017 6661453 Mother said you could always tell a lady<br />by her hands.
6661654 6665715 I guess things like hands and ladies<br />don't matter so much anymore.
6666458 6670394 You rest, Sue. You're not well yet,<br />and I can pick cotton for both of us.
6670462 6674091 Scarlett's hateful, making us work<br />in the fields like...
6674166 6675895 Too bad about that.
6676235 6679329 Now get back to work.<br />I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.
6679405 6682135 What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!
6685344 6688279 Don't you ever dare say<br />you hate Tara again!
6689081 6691572 It's the same as hating Pa and Ma.
6698290 6701054 Katie Scarlett, there's something<br />I must speak to you about.
6701126 6702184 Yes, Pa, what is it?
6702261 6706129 I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.<br />I don't like the way you're treating them.
6706198 6709690 You must be firm with inferiors,<br />but you must be gentle with them...
6709768 6711201 especially darkies.
6711270 6715138 Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them<br />to do anything I'm not doing myself.
6715207 6719541 Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it.<br />I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
6734193 6736286 What are you doing out of bed, Melly?
6736361 6739558 Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.<br />You are all working so hard.
6739631 6741326 I can't lie in bed doing nothing.
6741400 6743925 Go on back upstairs.<br />You're as weak as a newborn colt.
6744002 6745264 Please, Scarlett, let me.
6745337 6747635 Stop being noble.<br />I've got enough on my hands...
6747706 6750607 without you making yourself sick<br />so you'll never be any use.
6750676 6753201 Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
6808901 6811495 Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot.
6817810 6819744 You're alone, little lady?
6822581 6824947 You ain't very friendly, are you?
6827953 6830751 You got anything else<br />besides these earbobs?
6830823 6833348 You Yankees have been here before.
6833525 6836153 Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
6837196 6839664 What have you got hidden in your hand?
6875300 6877268 Scarlett, you killed him.
6878437 6880302 I'm glad you killed him.
6881473 6885432 Scarlett, what happened?<br />What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
6889281 6892512 Don't be scared, chickens.<br />Your big sister was cleaning a revolver...
6892584 6895144 and it went off<br />and nearly scared her to death.
6895220 6898348 Oh, thank goodness.<br />Haven't we got enough to frighten us?
6898523 6901083 Tell Katie Scarlett<br />she must be more careful.
6904296 6906594 What a cool liar you are, Melly.
6907232 6909496 We've got to get him out of here<br />and bury him.
6909568 6911593 If the Yankees find him here, they'll...
6911670 6914730 I didn't see anyone else.<br />I think he must be a deserter.
6914806 6916433 But even so, we've got to hide him.
6916508 6920274 They might hear about it,<br />and then they'd come and get you.
6923181 6925809 I could bury him in the arbor<br />where the ground is soft...
6925884 6928352 but how will I get him out of here?
6928987 6930614 We'll both take a leg and drag him.
6930689 6932452 You couldn't drag a cat.
6939264 6942597 Do you think it would be dishonest<br />if we went through his haversack?
6942668 6945136 I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
6945203 6948036 You take the haversack,<br />I'll search his pockets.
6960252 6961514 You look.
6961920 6963683 I'm feeling a little weak.
6963755 6966349 Melly, I think it's full of money!
6967192 6968784 Oh, Melly, look!
6968860 6969986 Look!
6970595 6971687 $10, $20, $30, $40...
6971763 6973890 Don't stop to count it now.<br />We haven't got time.
6973966 6976457 Do you realize this means<br />we'll have something to eat?
6976535 6978366 Look in his other pockets.
6980405 6981838 Hurry, hurry!
6982040 6984406 - We've got to get him out of here.<br />- Here.
6997689 7000590 If he bleeds across the yard,<br />we can't hide it.
7000659 7003628 Give me your nightgown, Melly.<br />I'll wad it around his head.
7003695 7005287 Don't be silly. I won't look at you.
7005364 7008697 If I had my petticoat or pantalets,<br />I'd use them.
7022280 7024578 Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
7025584 7028109 Now go back to bed.<br />You'll be dead if you don't.
7028186 7030848 I'll clean up the mess<br />when I've buried him.
7030922 7033083 No, I'll clean it up.
7036461 7038759 Well, I guess I've done murder.
7040332 7042459 I won't think about that now.
7042534 7044798 I'll think about that tomorrow.
7054112 7055636 Katie Scarlett!
7056581 7058105 Katie Scarlett!
7058383 7060214 It's over! It's over!
7061286 7063151 It's all over! The war!
7063221 7064745 Lee surrendered.
7064823 7067417 - It's not possible.<br />- Why did we ever fight?
7067492 7069551 Ashley will be coming home.
7069628 7071858 Yes, Ashley will be coming home.
7071930 7073557 We'll plant more cotton.
7073632 7075600 Cotton ought to go sky-high next year!
7092918 7095148 <i>While we were marching through Georgia</i>
7095220 7096551 <i>Hurrah, hurrah!</i>
7096621 7098020 <i>We bring the jubilee</i>
7098090 7099614 <i>Hurrah, hurrah!</i>
7099691 7101556 <i>The flag that makes you free</i>
7101626 7104595 <i>So we sing the chorus<br />from Atlanta to the sea</i>
7104796 7107526 <i>While we were marching through Georgia</i>
7108600 7110693 Get out of the road, rebel!<br />Get out of the way!
7110769 7113067 Have you room in your carriage<br />for a dying man?
7113138 7115800 I got no room for any Southern scum,<br />alive or dead.
7115874 7117273 Get out of the way.
7117342 7119867 I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.
7119945 7122573 Giddap! Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
7122714 7124614 Act like they won the war!
7125283 7128013 Now you come on and give me<br />them pants, Mr. Kennedy.
7128086 7129144 Come on.
7131423 7134950 You scrub yourself with that strong<br />lye soap before I scrubs you myself.
7135026 7138086 I'm gonna put these britches<br />in the boiling pot.
7140799 7143233 The whole Confederate Army's got<br />the same trouble:
7143301 7145360 Crawling clothes and dysentery.
7146271 7148171 It's humiliating,<br />how you treat Mr. Kennedy.
7148240 7152506 You'd be a sight more humiliated<br />if Mr. Kennedy's lice gets on you!
7154112 7155477 Come on, Beau.
7155547 7159813 We must leave this gentleman alone<br />because he's tired and he's hungry.
7160218 7163085 I don't mind, ma'am.<br />Good to see a youngster again.
7163155 7164554 Nice little fellow.
7164623 7168354 Another two years of war and we could<br />have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.
7169227 7170717 Were you in Cobb's Legion?
7170795 7172092 Yes, ma'am.
7172164 7175395 Why, then, you must know my husband,<br />Maj. Wilkes.
7175467 7176934 Oh, yes, ma'am.
7177002 7179470 He was captured at Spotsylvania, I think.
7179538 7180766 Captured!
7181640 7183904 Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't...
7183975 7186637 Oh, my poor Ashley in a Yankee prison!
7186711 7187939 Melanie.
7188046 7190810 Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.<br />Come along, Beau.
7190882 7193214 I'll watch out for him, ma'am.<br />We're good friends.
7193285 7194775 Oh, thank you.
7199191 7202649 I slave day and night so we can have<br />food to keep body and soul together.
7202727 7205195 And you give it all away<br />to these starving scarecrows.
7205263 7207231 I'd sooner have a plague of locusts here.
7207299 7209233 Don't scold me, Scarlett, please.
7209301 7212065 I've just heard<br />that Ashley was taken prisoner.
7212137 7213832 - Ashley, a prisoner?<br />- Yes.
7213905 7218103 And maybe if he's alive and well,<br />he's on some Northern road right now.
7218476 7221707 And maybe some Northern woman<br />is giving him a share of her dinner...
7221780 7224840 and helping my beloved<br />to come back home to me.
7226785 7227945 I hope so, Melly.
7228019 7229179 Miss Scarlett.
7232891 7236327 Miss Scarlett, I want to take up<br />something with your pa, but...
7236394 7237486 he doesn't seem to...
7237562 7240156 Perhaps I can help you.<br />I'm head of the house now.
7240232 7241893 Well, I...
7242467 7245527 Miss Scarlett, I was aiming<br />to ask for Suellen.
7246137 7248435 Do you mean to tell me<br />you haven't asked for her...
7248506 7250701 after all these years<br />she's been counting on you?
7250775 7254541 Well, the truth is,<br />I'm so much older than she is, and...
7254679 7256874 Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.
7256948 7258575 Who has nowadays?
7258750 7261685 Miss Scarlett, if true love<br />carries any weight with you...
7261753 7264381 you can be sure your sister<br />will be rich in that.
7264456 7268085 I'll go out somewhere and get myself<br />a little business if we're engaged.
7268159 7269717 As soon as I get on my feet again...
7269794 7272228 All right, Frank. I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
7272297 7274026 You go ask her now.
7274566 7276898 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
7280138 7282163 Excuse me, excuse me.
7284909 7287878 Scarlett, what seems to be<br />the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
7287946 7289880 More trouble than he guesses.
7289948 7291848 He's finally asked for Suellen's hand.
7291916 7293508 Oh, I'm so glad.
7293585 7298181 It's a pity he can't marry her now.<br />At least there'd be one less mouth to feed.
7301626 7303150 Oh, another one.
7303728 7305059 I hope this one isn't hungry.
7305130 7306222 He'll be hungry.
7306298 7309131 I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate...
7320578 7321772 Ashley!
7323915 7325177 Ashley!
7326885 7328113 Darling!
7338263 7340959 Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.
7341032 7343933 Turn me loose, you fool!<br />Turn me loose, it's Ashley!
7344002 7346095 He's her husband, ain't he?
7358316 7360511 - Miss Scarlett, ma'am.<br />- High time you got back.
7360585 7363418 - Did you get the horse shod?<br />- Yes, he shod all right.
7363488 7367288 Fine thing when a horse can get shoes<br />and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.
7367359 7369452 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
7369527 7372928 I gotta know how much money<br />have you got left, in gold.
7373164 7374859 $10. Why?
7375934 7377162 That won't be enough.
7377235 7379430 What in heaven's name are you<br />talking about?
7379504 7383736 Well, Miss Scarlett, I seed that old<br />no-count white-trash Wilkerson...
7383808 7386504 that used to be Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
7386578 7389979 He's a regular Yankee now,<br />and he was making a brag...
7390248 7395185 that his carpetbagger friends done run<br />the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
7395320 7397185 But how much more have we got to pay?
7397255 7400315 I hear the taxman say $300.
7400392 7401723 $300!
7403194 7405424 Might just as well be $3 million.
7405497 7407294 But we gotta raise it, that's all.
7407365 7408559 Yes, ma'am.
7408633 7409657 How?
7412070 7413401 I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
7413471 7415803 Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.
7415874 7418672 Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?
7420745 7422337 Asking ain't getting.
7431723 7432917 Ashley!
7434192 7437457 They say Abe Lincoln got his start<br />splitting rails.
7437629 7440097 Think what heights I may climb to<br />once I get the knack.
7441533 7444001 The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
7445804 7447396 What shall we do?
7448106 7450438 Ashley, what's to become of us?
7450708 7454200 What becomes of people<br />when their civilization breaks up?
7454279 7457248 Those who have brains and courage<br />come through all right.
7457315 7458976 Those that haven't are winnowed out.
7459050 7462349 For heaven's sake,<br />don't stand there talking nonsense at me...
7462420 7464285 when it's us who are being winnowed out.
7464355 7466084 You're right, Scarlett.
7466157 7469183 Here I am talking tommyrot<br />about civilization...
7469260 7471353 when your Tara's in danger.
7471529 7474896 You've come to me for help,<br />and I've no help to give you.
7474966 7476627 Oh, Scarlett, I...
7476701 7478191 I'm a coward.
7478970 7480835 You, Ashley, a coward?
7481606 7483403 What are you afraid of?
7483475 7486967 Oh, mostly of life becoming<br />too real for me, I suppose.
7488146 7490512 Not that I mind splitting rails...
7490949 7495318 but I do mind very much<br />losing the beauty of that life I loved.
7497455 7501949 If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent<br />my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
7502560 7504460 But the war did come.
7504696 7507358 I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
7507432 7510492 I saw men crumple up in agony<br />when I shot them.
7511202 7515263 And now I find myself in a world<br />which for me is worse than death.
7516040 7518838 A world in which there's no place for me.
7520512 7524414 I can never make you understand because<br />you don't know the meaning of fear.
7524482 7526916 You never mind facing realities...
7527719 7530586 and you never want<br />to escape from them as I do.
7533224 7534418 Escape?
7535760 7537523 Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.
7537929 7539863 I do want to escape, too.
7540198 7544294 I'm so very tired of it all.<br />I've struggled for food and for money.
7544369 7548772 I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton<br />until I can't stand it another minute.
7548840 7551331 I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.<br />It's dead.
7551409 7556142 The Yankees and the carpetbaggers<br />have got it and there's nothing left for us.
7557549 7558846 Oh, Ashley...
7559684 7561311 let's run away.
7561386 7562580 We'd go to Mexico.
7562654 7565851 They want officers in the Mexican Army.<br />We could be so happy there.
7565924 7569724 I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.<br />You know you don't love Melanie.
7569794 7571989 You told me you loved me<br />that day at Twelve Oaks.
7572063 7573997 And anyway, Melanie can't...
7574065 7577831 Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have<br />any more children and I could give you...
7577902 7579927 Can't we ever forget<br />that day at Twelve Oaks?
7580004 7582768 Do you think I could ever forget it?<br />Have you forgotten it?
7582840 7585536 Can you honestly say you don't love me?
7586544 7588910 - No. I don't love you.<br />- It's a lie!
7589013 7593074 Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie<br />and the baby, break Melanie's heart?
7593151 7595142 You couldn't leave<br />your father and the girls.
7595219 7597949 I could leave them. I'm sick of them.<br />I'm tired of them.
7598022 7601924 Yes, you're sick and tired.<br />That's why you're talking this way.
7602594 7604789 You've carried the load for all of us...
7604862 7608161 but from now on I'm going to be<br />more help to you, I promise.
7608232 7610325 There's only one way you can help me.
7610401 7611868 Take me away.
7612036 7614368 There's nothing to keep us here.
7615340 7616602 Nothing.
7618309 7620106 Nothing except honor.
7632724 7634453 Oh, please, Scarlett.
7634525 7636755 Please, dear, you mustn't cry.
7636961 7638019 You mustn't.
7638096 7640894 Please, my brave dear, you mustn't.
7653878 7656142 You do love me, you do love me.
7656214 7658478 - Say it, say it.<br />- Don't, don't.
7658549 7659948 You love me, you love me.
7660018 7662578 We won't do this, I tell you.<br />It won't happen again.
7662654 7664747 I'm going to take Melanie<br />and the baby, and go.
7664822 7666153 Say it, you love me.
7666224 7669853 All right, I'll say it. I love your courage<br />and your stubbornness.
7669927 7673693 So much that I could have forgotten<br />the best wife a man ever had.
7673765 7676666 But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.
7685877 7688311 Then there's nothing left for me.
7689313 7691372 Nothing to fight for.
7692216 7694150 Nothing to live for.
7696854 7698822 Yes, there is something.
7699757 7702282 Something you love better than me...
7702560 7704653 though you may not know it.
7710401 7711527 Tara!
7715306 7716864 Yes, I...
7718643 7720304 I still have this.
7725316 7726840 You needn't go.
7727518 7731852 I won't have you all starve simply<br />because I threw myself at your head.
7732457 7734322 It won't happen again.
7761819 7764310 - Why, it's Emmy Slattery.<br />- Yes, ma'am, it's me.
7764388 7765480 Stop!
7766124 7769025 You haven't forgotten your old overseer,<br />have you?
7769861 7771761 Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
7771829 7774798 Get off those steps, you trashy wench!<br />Get off this land!
7774866 7776697 You can't speak that way to my wife.
7776768 7779328 Wife! High time you made her your wife.
7779403 7782099 Who baptized your other brats<br />after you killed my mother?
7782173 7786735 We came out here to pay a friendly call<br />and talk a little business with old friends.
7786811 7789746 Friends! When were we ever friends<br />with the likes of you?
7789814 7793045 Still high and mighty, ain't you?<br />Well, I know all about you.
7793117 7794812 I know your father's turned idiot.
7794886 7796376 You can't pay your taxes.
7796454 7799014 And I come here<br />to offer to buy the place from you...
7799090 7800819 to make you a right good offer.
7800892 7802484 Emmy's had a hankering to live here.
7802560 7804323 Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.
7804395 7807762 You high-flying Irish will find out<br />who's running things around here...
7807832 7809493 when you get sold out for taxes.
7809567 7812502 I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel<br />and I'll live in it.
7812570 7814970 But I'll wait for the Sheriff's sale.
7815039 7817530 That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
7818743 7820734 You'll be sorry for that.
7829253 7830550 We'll be back!
7830621 7833317 I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.
7838663 7840153 Pa, come back!
7843301 7844461 Pa, come back!
7844535 7845559 Pa!
7847238 7848728 Yankee coward!
7856681 7857705 Pa!
7878202 7881296 Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.<br />That's Mr. Gerald's watch.
7881572 7884735 You take it. It's for you.<br />Pa'd want you to have it.
7884809 7888142 You ain't got no business parting<br />from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.
7888212 7891648 You needs all your valuables<br />to sell for that tax money.
7891816 7894216 You think I'd sell Pa's watch?
7895486 7897010 And don't cry.
7897722 7900486 I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
7904161 7905856 Oh, Mammy, Mammy.
7911769 7916172 You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett,<br />you just gotta go on being brave.
7916374 7918365 Think about your pa like he used to be.
7918442 7920273 I can't think about Pa.
7920511 7922638 I can't think of anything but that $300.
7922713 7924874 Ain't no good thinking about that,<br />Miss Scarlett.
7924949 7926712 Ain't nobody got that much money.
7927718 7931279 Nobody but Yankees and scalawags<br />got that much money now.
7933457 7934515 Rhett!
7934592 7936321 Who that? A Yankee?
7941499 7944400 Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and...
7945269 7947134 I haven't any clothes.
7956747 7959875 Scoot up to the attic and get down<br />Ma's old box of dress patterns.
7959951 7961748 What you up to with Miss Ellen's portiere?
7961819 7962911 You'll make me a new dress.
7962987 7965820 Not with Miss Ellen's portieres.<br />Not while I got breath in me.
7965890 7968484 Great balls of fire!<br />They're my portieres now.
7968559 7972120 I'm going to Atlanta for that $300<br />and I've got to go looking like a queen.
7972196 7974391 - Who going to Atlanta with you?<br />- I'm going alone.
7974465 7976865 That's what you think.<br />I's going to Atlanta with you.
7976934 7978492 With you and that new dress.
7978569 7979593 Now, Mammy, darling.
7979670 7981661 No use to try to sweet-talk me,<br />Miss Scarlett.
7981739 7984435 I's knowed you since I put<br />the first pair of diapers on you.
7984508 7987102 I said I's going to Atlanta with you,<br />and going I is.
7987745 7990908 Kings and treys, huh?<br />Too good for me, Major!
7991315 7994148 Pity we couldn't have fought the war out<br />in a poker game.
7994218 7997244 You'd have done better than Gen. Grant<br />with far less effort.
7997321 7998447 What is it, Corporal?
7998522 8002253 Sir, there's a lady to see Capt. Butler.<br />Says she's his sister.
8002326 8003850 Another sister?
8004195 8006561 This is a jail, not a harem, Capt. Butler.
8006630 8008461 No, Major, she ain't one of those.
8008532 8011000 This one's got her mammy with her.
8011235 8012395 She has?
8013504 8016769 I'd like to see this one, Major,<br />without her mammy.
8018275 8021574 Let's see, my losses for the afternoon<br />come to what?
8023547 8025139 $340.
8025216 8027946 My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?
8028152 8029380 All right, Corporal.
8029453 8032320 Show Capt. Butler's sister to his cell.
8033190 8035920 Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen.
8040498 8044093 It's hard to be strict with a man<br />who loses money so pleasantly.
8046170 8048468 - Rhett!<br />- Scarlett!
8048939 8051032 My dear little sister.
8052610 8056774 It's all right, Corporal.<br />My sister has brought me no files or saws.
8062119 8063313 Can I really kiss you now?
8063387 8065514 On the forehead like a good brother.
8065589 8068285 No, thanks.<br />I'll wait and hope for better things.
8069093 8072119 Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed<br />when I heard you were in jail.
8072259 8074352 I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.
8074428 8076419 It's not true they're going to hang you?
8076497 8077657 Would you be sorry?
8077764 8079595 - Oh, Rhett!<br />- Well, don't worry yet.
8079666 8081634 They have plotted<br />some charge against me...
8081702 8083397 but they're really after my money.
8083470 8085802 They think I made off<br />with the Confederate Treasury.
8085873 8087363 Well, did you?
8087541 8089099 What a leading question.
8089176 8091667 But let's not talk<br />about sordid things like money.
8091745 8094976 How good of you to come and see me.<br />And how pretty you look.
8095048 8098017 Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,<br />teasing a country girl like me.
8098085 8101350 Thank heavens you're not in rags.<br />I'm tired of seeing women in rags.
8101421 8102820 Turn around.
8103457 8105982 You look good enough to eat.<br />And prosperous, too.
8106059 8107890 Thank you, I've been doing very well.
8107961 8109758 Everybody's doing well at Tara, only...
8109830 8113391 I got so bored I just thought<br />I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
8113467 8116197 You're a heartless creature.<br />But that's part of your charm.
8116270 8118534 You know you've got more charm<br />than the law allows.
8118605 8121165 Now I didn't come here<br />to talk silliness about me, Rhett.
8121241 8124335 I came because I was so miserable<br />at the thought of you in trouble.
8124411 8127278 I was mad at you the night you left me<br />on the road to Tara...
8127347 8128871 and I still haven't forgiven you.
8128949 8130541 Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.
8130617 8134314 Well, I must admit<br />I might not be alive now, only for you.
8134688 8138419 And when I think of myself<br />with everything I could possibly hope for...
8138492 8142360 and not a care in the world,<br />and you here in this horrid jail...
8142863 8145832 and not even a human jail, Rhett,<br />a horse jail.
8147267 8149827 Oh, listen to me<br />trying to make jokes when...
8149903 8151962 when I really want to cry.
8152105 8154073 In a minute I shall cry.
8157177 8160010 Scarlett, can it be possible that...
8160714 8162682 Can what be possible, Rhett?
8162749 8166241 That you've grown a woman's heart,<br />a real woman's heart?
8166486 8168613 I have, Rhett. I know I have.
8171425 8175225 You know, it's worth being in jail<br />just to hear you say that.
8176530 8178259 It's well worth it.
8182769 8185237 You can drop the moonlight<br />and magnolias, Scarlett.
8185305 8187705 So things have been going well<br />at Tara, have they?
8187774 8189298 What have you done with your hands?
8189376 8191276 I went riding last week without my gloves.
8191345 8194746 These don't belong to a lady.<br />You've worked with them like a field hand.
8194815 8196646 Why did you lie? What are you up to?
8196717 8199413 In another minute, I'd almost believe<br />you cared something.
8199486 8200578 But I do care.
8200654 8202053 Suppose we get down to the truth.
8202122 8203885 You want something from me<br />badly enough...
8203957 8206357 to put on quite a show in your velvets.
8206426 8207825 What is it? Money?
8208962 8211556 I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
8211832 8214562 I did lie to you<br />when I said everything was all right.
8214635 8218628 Things are just as bad as they possibly<br />could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.
8219606 8221471 What collateral are you offering?
8221575 8223167 - My earbobs.<br />- Not interested.
8223243 8225438 - A mortgage on Tara.<br />- What would I do with a farm?
8225512 8228310 You wouldn't lose.<br />I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.
8228382 8231146 Not good enough.<br />Have you nothing better?
8232986 8235113 You once said you loved me.
8235489 8237684 If you still love me, Rhett...
8237758 8240955 You haven't forgotten<br />that I'm not a marrying man?
8241028 8243326 No, I haven't forgotten.
8249002 8250867 You're not worth $300.
8251471 8254338 You'll never mean anything<br />but misery to any man.
8254408 8255466 Go on, insult me.
8255542 8257703 I don't care what you say,<br />only give me the money.
8257778 8261544 I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go<br />while there's a breath left in my body.
8261782 8262840 Oh, Rhett.
8263150 8265277 Won't you please give me the money?
8265452 8267818 I couldn't give you the money<br />if I wanted to.
8267888 8269981 My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.
8270057 8273891 If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd<br />be on me like a duck on a June bug.
8274061 8277030 So you see, my dear,<br />you've abased yourself to no purpose.
8280267 8282064 Here, here, here, stop it!
8282836 8284963 Want the Yankees to see you like this?
8285038 8286869 Take your hands off me, you skunk.
8286973 8289237 You knew what I was going to say<br />before I started.
8289309 8292574 You knew you wouldn't lend me<br />the money and yet you let me go on.
8292646 8294443 I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.
8294514 8297915 Cheer up. You can come to my hanging<br />and I'll remember you in my will.
8297984 8300851 I'll come to your hanging.<br />The only thing I'm afraid of...
8300921 8304015 is that they won't hang you in time<br />to pay the taxes on Tara.
8310630 8312291 Tell him Belle Watling.
8312366 8315199 Where you been lately?<br />Thought you'd deserted Capt. Butler.
8315268 8317964 Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out.
8327013 8330608 Who that? I ain't never seen hair<br />that color before in my life.
8330951 8332782 Does you know a dyed-haired woman?
8332853 8335515 I wish I did know that one.<br />She'd get my money for me.
8337724 8340124 No matter what they done to you<br />in that jail...
8340193 8341990 they didn't do no more than you deserve...
8342062 8344121 for visiting white trash in a jail!
8350937 8352131 Fresh and green.
8352205 8353365 Right off the farm.
8353440 8355499 Hey, what are you doing tonight, Susy?
8355575 8357236 That's one of them Georgia peaches.
8357310 8359335 There's nothing like that in Ohio.
8359413 8362007 - You know what we're going to do?<br />- What?
8362082 8365108 We're going to give every last one of you<br />40 acres and a mule!
8365185 8367619 - And a mule?<br />- Forty acres and a mule!
8367721 8368847 Gee!
8368922 8370685 'Cause we're your friends...
8370757 8372657 and you're gonna become voters...
8372726 8374990 and you're gonna vote like your friends do!
8376830 8378229 What's your hurry, sister?
8378298 8379697 What's come over this here town?
8379766 8383668 Yankees have come over it!<br />Same as they've come over all of us.
8385472 8387372 Out of our way, trash!
8387574 8388768 Get out of the way here.
8388842 8390400 Get away! Go on!
8398518 8399917 Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!
8399986 8402420 - Why, Frank Kennedy!<br />- And Mammy!
8402489 8404252 It sure is good to see home folks.
8404324 8405848 I didn't know you were in Atlanta.
8405926 8407359 I didn't know you were.
8407427 8409895 Didn't Miss Suellen tell you<br />about my store?
8409963 8412864 Did she? I don't remember.<br />Have you a store?
8413033 8414091 This?
8414167 8416431 Won't you come in and look around a bit?
8424845 8427439 I don't suppose it looks like much<br />to a lady, but...
8427514 8429379 I can't help being proud of it.
8430050 8431347 You're not making money?
8431418 8434615 Well, I can't complain.<br />In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
8435121 8437681 Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
8437757 8440885 It won't be long now<br />before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
8440961 8442519 Are you doing as well as all that?
8442596 8444393 Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.
8444464 8446295 I'm no millionaire yet...
8446366 8448732 but I've cleared $1,000 already.
8449035 8450127 And lumber, too.
8450203 8451295 Well...
8452005 8453302 that's only a sideline.
8453373 8454840 A sideline, Frank?
8455008 8458944 With all the good Georgia pine around<br />Atlanta and all this building going on?
8459012 8461981 Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...
8462516 8464643 and I've got to be thinking<br />about buying a home.
8464718 8466242 What do you want a home for?
8466319 8468947 For Miss Suellen and me<br />to set up housekeeping.
8469022 8472355 Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her<br />to Atlanta, wouldn't you?
8473226 8476161 There wouldn't be much help<br />in that for Tara.
8476563 8479498 I don't rightly know what you mean,<br />Miss Scarlett.
8479566 8480828 I don't mean a thing.
8480901 8484462 Frank, how'd you like to drive me out<br />to my Aunt Pitty's?
8485038 8487370 Nothing would give me<br />more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.
8487440 8489135 You'd better stay to supper, too.
8489209 8492770 I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable<br />and I'd like a good long visit with you.
8492846 8495474 Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,<br />Miss Scarlett.
8496550 8498780 And will you tell me all the news...
8498852 8501047 all the news of Miss Suellen?
8503456 8505287 What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?
8505358 8506882 Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
8506960 8508325 Oh, no, no.
8508662 8510630 I thought surely she had written you.
8510697 8512358 I guess she was ashamed to write you.
8512432 8514024 She should be ashamed.
8514100 8516728 Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.
8516803 8520500 You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
8520974 8524774 Well, she's going to marry<br />one of the county boys next month.
8525545 8529174 She just got tired of waiting<br />and was afraid she'd be an old maid...
8529249 8531979 Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
8532652 8535348 Oh, it's cold. I left my muff at home.
8535589 8538456 Would you mind<br />if I put my hand in your pocket?
8554841 8557901 But, Melanie, you don't realize<br />what she's done.
8557978 8560378 She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.
8560447 8562574 He's my beau,<br />and she's gone and married him.
8562649 8564879 She did it to save Tara,<br />you must understand that.
8564951 8566213 I hate Tara!
8566286 8570347 And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing<br />I hate worse than Tara.
8574160 8575821 It's all my fault.
8576730 8580029 I should have committed highway robbery<br />to get that tax money for you.
8580100 8582466 I couldn't let you<br />do anything like that, and...
8582736 8584226 Well, anyway, it's done now.
8584304 8586067 Yes, it's done now.
8586573 8588666 You wouldn't let me<br />do anything dishonorable...
8588742 8592269 but you'd sell yourself in marriage<br />to a man you didn't love.
8592345 8596543 Well, at least you won't have to worry<br />about my helplessness anymore.
8596883 8598373 What do you mean?
8598451 8600351 I'm going to New York.
8601354 8603481 I've arranged to get a position<br />in a bank there.
8603556 8605421 But you can't do that.
8606993 8610190 I counted on you to help me start<br />a lumber business, Ashley...
8610263 8612128 and, well, I counted on you.
8612198 8613460 I wouldn't be any good to you.
8613533 8615626 I don't know anything<br />about the lumber business.
8615702 8618193 You know as much as you do<br />about banking.
8618271 8621172 And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.
8621241 8623641 That's generous of you, Scarlett.
8624210 8625871 But it isn't that.
8625945 8629073 If I go to Atlanta<br />and take help from you again...
8629149 8631640 I'd bury forever any hope<br />of standing alone.
8631718 8633208 Oh, is that all?
8633286 8637347 Well, you could gradually buy the business<br />and then it would be your own, and...
8638692 8639989 No, Scarlett.
8643596 8644790 Ashley...
8652639 8653867 Ashley.
8661314 8662679 Scarlett!
8664217 8665582 Scarlett, what is it?
8665652 8667847 Ashley's so mean and hateful.
8668054 8669817 What have you done?
8672025 8673754 She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
8673827 8678025 To help me start my lumber business, and<br />he won't lift a finger to help me, and he...
8678098 8680032 Why, how unchivalrous of you.
8680100 8682091 Why, think, Ashley, think.
8682302 8685499 If it hadn't been for Scarlett,<br />I'd have died in Atlanta.
8685572 8688370 And maybe we wouldn't have had<br />little Beau...
8688441 8691877 and when I think of her picking cotton<br />and plowing just to keep food...
8691945 8693674 in our mouths, I could just...
8693747 8695271 Oh, my darling.
8699853 8701582 All right, Melanie.
8701721 8703450 I'll go to Atlanta.
8704791 8706725 I can't fight you both.
8725979 8729005 Well, here's your new mill hands,<br />Mrs. Kennedy.
8729082 8731949 The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
8732452 8734613 They look pretty thin and weak to me,<br />Gallagher.
8734687 8735847 Halt!
8738158 8739819 They're the best you can lease, ma'am.
8739893 8742726 And if you'll just give Johnny Gallagher<br />a free hand...
8742796 8745128 you'll get what you want out of them.
8745198 8747166 All right, you're the foreman.
8747233 8750964 All I ask is, you keep the mill running<br />and deliver my lumber when I want it.
8751037 8752595 Johnny Gallagher's your man, miss.
8752672 8753969 But remember...
8754040 8756508 no questions and no interference.
8756576 8759272 That's a bargain.<br />Start them in the morning, Gallagher.
8759345 8761677 Come on, get a move on!<br />Come on, move on there!
8761748 8764273 But, Scarlett, this isn't right<br />and you know it.
8764350 8766875 It's bad enough for a woman<br />to be in business, but...
8766953 8768250 What are you complaining about?
8768321 8770619 You wouldn't have owned a mill<br />had I not taken over.
8770690 8773284 I didn't want the mill,<br />and we couldn't have bought it...
8773359 8776522 if you hadn't pressed all of our friends<br />for the money they owed me.
8776596 8777722 Isn't that right, Ashley?
8777797 8779890 What, are you running<br />a charitable institution?
8779966 8782594 Go back to the store,<br />then go home and take your medicine.
8782669 8783863 You're not looking very well.
8783937 8785996 But, sugar, shouldn't you come home<br />with me?
8786072 8789439 Great balls of fire. Don't bother me<br />anymore, and don't call me sugar!
8789509 8791340 All right, all right.
8791878 8793368 Good night, Ashley.
8795448 8798246 She can get mad quicker<br />than any woman I ever saw.
8799786 8801913 Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...
8801988 8805253 I do wish you'd let me hire free darkies<br />instead of using convicts.
8805325 8806758 I believe we could do better.
8806826 8809989 Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,<br />and convicts are dirt-cheap.
8810063 8811724 If we just give Gallagher a free hand...
8811798 8815165 A free hand! You know what that means.<br />He'll starve them and whip them.
8815235 8817203 Some of them are sick, underfed...
8817270 8818862 Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.
8818938 8821964 Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken<br />three times a day and...
8822041 8824202 tucking them to sleep<br />with eiderdown quilts.
8824277 8828008 I will not make money out<br />of the enforced labor and misery of others.
8828081 8830106 You weren't so particular<br />about owning slaves.
8830183 8832617 That was different.<br />We didn't treat them that way.
8832685 8835017 Besides, I'd have freed them all<br />when father died...
8835088 8837318 if the war hadn't already freed them.
8837390 8838687 Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
8839025 8841323 But have you forgotten<br />what it's like without money?
8841394 8844454 I found out that money is<br />the most important thing in the world...
8844530 8846691 and I don't intend ever to be<br />without it again.
8846766 8849758 I'll make enough so the Yankees<br />can never take Tara away from me.
8849836 8851428 I'll make it the only way I know how.
8851504 8853995 But we're not the only Southerners<br />who have suffered.
8854073 8857839 Look at all our friends. They're keeping<br />their honor and their kindness, too.
8857911 8861574 And they're starving. I've got no use<br />for fools who won't help themselves.
8861648 8864082 I know what they're saying about me,<br />and I don't care.
8864150 8866175 I'll make friends<br />with Yankee carpetbaggers.
8866252 8869187 I'll beat them at their own game,<br />and you'll beat them with me.
8871591 8874583 That's it. Move it a little over to that side.
8874961 8876519 Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
8876596 8877585 Good afternoon.
8877664 8879427 Business is certainly growing, ain't it?
8879499 8880625 It certainly is.
8882035 8885004 But you're doing business<br />with the same people who robbed us...
8885071 8887631 and tortured us and left us to starve.
8887707 8888867 All that's past, Melly.
8888942 8892434 And I intend to make the best of things,<br />even if they are Yankee things.
8895114 8898515 And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,<br />that Dr. Meade actually saw her...
8898584 8900950 peddling lumber to those Yankees herself.
8901020 8902044 And that isn't all...
8902121 8904988 I think it's shocking what she's doing<br />to my brother Ashley.
8905058 8907583 She's even taken<br />to driving her own buggy.
8915401 8917096 My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
8917170 8918899 My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.
8919238 8921229 I don't see how you have<br />the gall to face me.
8921307 8923298 When I think you could have had<br />my millions...
8923376 8924900 if you'd just waited a little while.
8924978 8926946 Oh, how fickle is woman!
8927113 8929513 What is it you want?<br />I have important things to do.
8929582 8933780 Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point<br />which has bothered me for some time?
8933853 8935480 Well, what is it? Be quick.
8935555 8939389 Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink<br />from marrying men you don't love?
8939926 8943453 How did you ever get out of jail?<br />Why didn't they hang you?
8943529 8945224 Oh, that! Not much trouble.
8945298 8947163 There's nothing much<br />that money won't buy.
8947233 8950669 I observe it's even bought you<br />the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
8950737 8952796 So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
8952872 8954863 Do you know,<br />I believe you're jealous of him.
8954941 8957569 You still think<br />you're the belle of the county, don't you?
8957643 8959975 That you're the cutest little trick<br />in shoe leather.
8960046 8962173 Every man you meet<br />is dying of love for you.
8962248 8963579 Let me by!
8963983 8967077 Don't be angry, Scarlett.<br />Tell me, where are you going?
8967153 8969018 To the mill, if it's any of your business.
8969088 8970350 Through shantytown, alone?
8970423 8974154 Haven't you been told it's dangerous<br />to drive alone through all that riffraff?
8974227 8975660 Don't worry about me.
8975728 8978993 I can shoot straight<br />if I don't have to shoot too far.
8986105 8987538 What a woman!
9022508 9024066 Could you give me a quarter?
9024143 9025508 Let go of my horse!
9027814 9029441 Hold this horse!
9039992 9041050 Help!
9041594 9042993 Help!
9044597 9045689 Help!
9079932 9081229 Miss Scarlett!
9100286 9102777 Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!
9103222 9104746 Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!
9104824 9105848 Big Sam!
9106192 9108023 Miss Scarlett! Wait!
9110196 9111595 Sam! Sam!
9112064 9115056 Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br />Did they hurt you?
9115968 9119665 Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.<br />Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.
9120606 9122233 Horse, make tracks!
9125645 9128239 You get to Tara just as quick as you can<br />and stay there.
9128314 9130942 I sure will.<br />I got enough of them carpetbaggers.
9131017 9133178 Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br />Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
9133252 9134879 Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.
9134954 9138390 Scarlett, change your dress and go over<br />to Miss Melly's for the evening.
9138457 9140322 I've got to go to a political meeting.
9140393 9141485 A political meeting!
9141561 9143290 How can you go to a political meeting...
9143362 9145421 after what I've been through<br />this afternoon?
9145498 9148092 Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.
9148167 9152228 Nobody cares about me.<br />You all act as though it was nothing at all.
9174026 9176927 The men talk, talk, talk<br />about protecting our women...
9176996 9181558 and after what happened to me today<br />Frank has to go to a political meeting.
9184971 9187701 And if it won't pain you too much,<br />India Wilkes...
9187773 9190674 I'd be much obliged<br />if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.
9190743 9192301 Has my face gone green or something?
9192378 9193640 It won't pain me!
9193713 9196238 What happened this afternoon<br />was just what you deserved!
9196315 9198715 If there was any justice,<br />you'd have gotten worse.
9198784 9199773 India, hush up!
9199852 9201479 Let her talk. She's always hated me!
9201554 9203647 Ever since I took your brother<br />away from her...
9203723 9205918 though she's too much of a hypocrite<br />to admit it!
9205992 9207584 If she thought anyone'd go for her...
9207660 9209093 she'd walk down the street naked!
9209161 9210719 I do hate you!
9211597 9214828 You've done all you could<br />to lower the prestige of decent people.
9214900 9217630 Now you've endangered the lives<br />of our men, because they...
9217703 9218829 India!
9218904 9222704 I don't think we'd better say any more,<br />or one of us will be saying too much.
9222775 9225437 What's going on around here<br />that I don't know about?
9231284 9233081 Somebody's coming up the walk.
9233152 9235450 Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
9235788 9238882 Will you hand me the pistol, please,<br />Mrs. Meade?
9244730 9246322 Whoever it is...
9247133 9248930 we know nothing.
9251837 9252963 Where have they gone?
9253072 9255563 You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />It's life or death!
9255641 9257871 Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.
9257943 9260173 Quickly, please! There may still be time.
9260246 9261235 How did you know?
9261314 9263248 I was playing poker<br />with two Yankee captains.
9263316 9264647 They knew there'd be trouble.
9264717 9266082 They've sent their cavalry out.
9266152 9268484 Your husband and his friends<br />are walking into a trap.
9268554 9271318 Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!
9273859 9276487 At the Decatur Road.<br />The old Sullivan plantation.
9276562 9278860 The house is burned.<br />They're meeting in the cellar.
9278931 9280660 I'll do what I can.
9285071 9287938 What's all this about?<br />If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!
9288007 9289599 We thought it best not to tell you.
9289675 9292872 Ashley, Frank and the others<br />have gone to clean out those woods...
9292945 9294003 where you were attacked.
9294080 9296048 A great many Southern gentlemen have...
9296115 9297707 done this lately for our protection.
9297783 9301014 And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,<br />Scarlett!
9301087 9302349 And it will be your fault!
9302421 9304616 Another word,<br />and you go out of this house, India!
9304690 9306681 Scarlett did what she thought<br />she had to do.
9306759 9310126 And our men are doing<br />what they think they have to do.
9310196 9311390 Frank!
9312031 9313396 And Ashley!
9315601 9317466 Oh, it isn't possible!
9320773 9323298 There's horses, Miss Melly.<br />Here they come.
9323376 9325310 You're sewing, you're sewing.
9329882 9331679 Open the door, Mammy.
9341394 9343487 Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
9345531 9347226 Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?
9347299 9348926 I am Mrs. Wilkes.
9349235 9351669 I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,<br />if you please.
9351737 9352999 He's not here.
9353072 9354061 Are you sure?
9354140 9356267 Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.
9356342 9358810 I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
9358878 9361346 If you'll give me your word,<br />I won't search the house.
9361414 9365441 Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at<br />a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
9365518 9368385 He's not at the store,<br />and there's no meeting tonight!
9368454 9370115 No political meeting.
9370189 9373386 We'll wait outside<br />till he and his friends return.
9374160 9377220 Sergeant, surround the house.<br />Put a man on each door and window.
9377296 9378558 Yes, sir!
9382968 9385368 Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
9385704 9388002 And I'll read aloud.
9391510 9395173 "The Personal History and Experience<br />of David Copperfield.
9397683 9399173 "Chapter one.
9399251 9400548 "I am born.
9404924 9408690 "To begin my life with the beginning<br />of my life, I record that I was born.
9409628 9412188 "Chapter Nine.<br />I have a memorable birthday.
9412264 9414289 "I pass over all that happened at school...
9414366 9417563 "until the anniversary of my birthday<br />came around in March.
9418671 9421367 "Except that Steerforth was more to be<br />admired than ever...
9421440 9422702 "I remember nothing.
9422775 9425869 "He was going away at the end<br />of the half-year, if not sooner...
9425978 9429311 "and was more spirited and independent<br />than before in my eyes...
9429748 9432182 "and therefore more engaging<br />than before; but...
9432251 9434151 "beyond this I remember nothing.
9435020 9436248 "The great...
9438624 9439750 "I remember nothing. "
9444797 9446492 Melly! They're drunk!
9447199 9448928 Leave this to me, Scarlett.
9449001 9450798 And please, say nothing.
9454240 9456140 You stupid fool!
9457943 9459069 Quiet!
9459712 9462112 Will you shut up for the love of...
9462181 9463375 Hello, Melly.
9463449 9466850 So you've got my husband<br />intoxicated again, Capt. Butler!
9466919 9467943 Well, bring him in.
9468020 9470386 I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />Your husband's under arrest.
9470456 9472686 If you arrest all the men<br />who get intoxicated...
9472758 9475352 you must have<br />a good many Yankees in jail.
9475427 9478885 Bring him in, Capt. Butler.<br />If you can walk yourself.
9480065 9481532 I want to tell you a story...
9481600 9483227 Listen, Doctor, I...
9483302 9485429 Put him there in that chair.
9488407 9491069 And now, Capt. Butler,<br />will you please leave my house...
9491143 9493737 and try to remember<br />not to come here again?
9494046 9496844 Well, now, that's fine thanks I get<br />for bringing him home...
9496916 9499783 and not leaving him on the streets<br />in this shameful condition!
9499852 9501479 Now, boys, all together!
9501921 9503445 Dr. Meade...
9504056 9505921 I'm astonished at you!
9512698 9515326 Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?
9516769 9518964 I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
9519338 9522239 Take him into the bedroom<br />and lay him out on the bed as usual.
9522308 9523900 Don't touch him, he's under arrest!
9523976 9525000 Now, Tom.
9525077 9526874 What do you want to arrest him for?
9527212 9528873 I've seen him drunker.
9529114 9531708 I've seen you drunker!<br />And you've seen me...
9531784 9535083 He can lie in the gutter for all I care!<br />I'm not a policeman.
9535154 9537247 But he led a raid tonight<br />on that shantytown...
9537323 9540121 where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble<br />this afternoon.
9540192 9543218 A lot of those shanties were burned.<br />A couple of men were killed.
9543295 9547356 It's about time you rebels learned you<br />can't take the law into your own hands.
9547433 9549401 What are you laughing at?
9550669 9553502 This isn't your night<br />to teach that lesson, Tom.
9553572 9556439 These two have been<br />with me tonight. Yes, sir.
9556709 9558336 With you, Rhett?
9558911 9560105 Where?
9564083 9566916 I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
9566986 9568613 You'd better say.
9568721 9570848 Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
9570923 9572117 Speak out, Capt. Butler!
9572191 9575683 I think I have a right to know<br />where my husband's been.
9577096 9580361 Well, ma'am, we dropped in<br />on a friend of mine...
9581634 9583295 and the Captain's.
9583402 9585233 A Mrs. Belle Watling.
9585838 9588932 We played cards, drank champagne and...
9589708 9591005 well...
9591076 9594512 Now you've done it! Did you have to<br />show me up in front of my wife?
9596115 9598083 Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.
9598150 9601483 These ladies won't be on speaking terms<br />with their husbands tomorrow.
9602921 9604946 Rhett, I had no idea, I...
9606225 9610184 Look here, will you take an oath<br />that they were with you tonight at...
9610262 9611388 at Belle's?
9611797 9614732 Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.<br />She'll tell you, Captain.
9614800 9617234 Will you give me your word<br />as a gentleman?
9617302 9618735 As a gentleman?
9618804 9620567 Why, certainly, Tom.
9622775 9624072 Well, if I...
9624143 9626270 if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
9627379 9630314 I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I...
9631450 9633543 If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.
9633619 9636213 Well, I say I'm sorry, and...
9637356 9638983 well, I am sorry.
9639058 9640753 Come on, Sergeant.
9647032 9649626 Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
9651203 9652295 Ashley.
9652371 9654896 He's all right. It's only in the shoulder.
9654973 9657339 Get him on the bed<br />where I can dress the wound.
9657409 9658842 I think I can walk.
9659878 9661937 It's not worth the effort. Which way?
9662014 9663072 In here.
9664750 9666718 - Mammy, I want some hot water.<br />- Yes, sir.
9666785 9668582 - And lint for bandages.<br />- I'll find some.
9668654 9671282 Now what can I use for a probe?<br />If I only had my bag.
9671356 9674018 Were you really there?<br />What did it look like?
9674660 9678756 Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br />plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
9678831 9681698 Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br />remember yourself.
9683702 9687365 Now, Capt. Butler,<br />tell me what happened, all that happened.
9687439 9688804 I was too late.
9688874 9690739 When I got to the old Sullivan place...
9690843 9693004 there'd already been a skirmish<br />with the Yankees.
9693078 9696172 I found Mr. Wilkes wounded<br />and Dr. Meade was with him.
9696248 9699547 I had to prove they had been somewhere,<br />anyplace but where they were.
9700619 9702280 So I took them to Belle's.
9702354 9703946 And she took them in?
9704022 9706684 She's by way of being<br />an old friend of mine.
9706759 9708750 Oh, I'm sorry. I...
9708827 9712160 I'm sorry I couldn't think up<br />a more dignified alibi.
9715100 9719059 This isn't the first time you've come<br />between me and disaster, Capt. Butler.
9719138 9722630 It isn't likely that I'd question<br />any device of yours.
9724176 9727441 And now I'll go and see<br />what Dr. Meade needs.
9733152 9734517 Oh, Ashley!
9736321 9737413 Ashley!
9739458 9743417 Have you no interest in what's become<br />of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?
9745731 9748165 Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
9748233 9749325 No.
9749935 9751596 Well, where is he?
9752004 9754404 He's lying out on Decatur Road...
9754873 9756738 shot through the head.
9757509 9758874 He's dead.
9768887 9770149 Who is it?
9770322 9771721 It's Miss Watling.
9771790 9774657 Oh, Miss Watling!<br />Won't you come in the house?
9774726 9777456 Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.
9777930 9780490 You come in and sit a minute with me.
9788006 9790474 How can I thank you enough<br />for what you did for us?
9790542 9792305 How can any of us thank you enough?
9792377 9795505 I got your note saying you was going<br />to call on me and thank me.
9795581 9798311 Why, Miss Wilkes,<br />you must have lost your mind.
9798383 9800908 I come up here as soon<br />as it was dark to tell you...
9800986 9803250 you mustn't even think of any such thing.
9803322 9804687 Why, I'm...
9805257 9806724 Why, you're...
9806792 9808589 Well, it wouldn't be fitting at all.
9808660 9812687 It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind<br />woman who saved my husband's life?
9812764 9817133 Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady<br />in this town nice to me like you was.
9817903 9820701 I mean, about the money<br />for the hospital, you know.
9820772 9822501 And I don't forget a kindness.
9822574 9825941 And I got to thinking about you<br />being left a widow with a little boy...
9826011 9827706 if Mr. Wilkes got hung...
9828313 9831646 and he's a nice little boy,<br />your boy is, Miss Wilkes.
9831950 9834475 I got a boy myself and so I...
9835087 9837282 Oh, you have? Does he live...
9837356 9840086 Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.
9840826 9842726 He ain't never been here.
9842794 9844728 He's off at school.
9845197 9847825 I ain't seen him since he was little.
9850235 9854467 Well, anyway, if it had been<br />that Miss Kennedy's husband by himself...
9854539 9857975 I wouldn't have lifted a finger,<br />no matter what Capt. Butler said.
9858043 9859977 She's a mighty cold woman.
9860045 9862206 Prancing about Atlanta by herself.
9862681 9865548 She killed her husband<br />same as if she shot him.
9865617 9868279 You mustn't say unkind things<br />about my sister-in-law.
9871924 9874154 Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.
9874226 9876319 I forgot how you liked her.
9877195 9881222 But she just ain't in the same class<br />with you and I can't help it if I think so.
9882034 9884696 Well, anyway, I got to be going.
9885337 9889103 I'm scared somebody'll recognize<br />this carriage if I stayed here any longer.
9889174 9891369 That wouldn't do you no good.
9891877 9893310 And, Miss Wilkes...
9893845 9897246 if you ever see me on the street,<br />you don't have to speak to me.
9897849 9899441 I'll understand.
9899985 9904046 I should be proud to speak to you.<br />Proud to be under obligation to you.
9905123 9906852 I hope we meet again.
9906925 9909155 Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fitting.
9911229 9914255 - Good night, Miss Wilkes.<br />- Good night, Miss Watling.
9919538 9921699 And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
9921773 9923968 She's brokenhearted about her husband.
9968353 9970617 Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.
9996848 9999339 Miss Scarlett, Capt. Butler here<br />to see you.
9999418 10001579 I told him you was prostrate with grief.
10001653 10004281 Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
10034886 10036319 She says she's coming.
10036388 10039050 I don't know why she's coming.<br />But she's a-coming.
10039157 10040647 You don't like me, Mammy.
10040725 10043956 Now don't you argue with me.<br />You don't. You really don't.
10056041 10057872 It's no good, Scarlett.
10057943 10059001 What?
10059077 10060476 The cologne.
10060612 10062773 I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
10063281 10066682 I mean you've been drinking.<br />Brandy. Quite a lot.
10067385 10070548 What if I have? Is that any of your affair?
10072524 10074287 Don't drink alone, Scarlett.
10074359 10077260 People always find out<br />and it ruins the reputation.
10083768 10084894 What is it?
10084970 10087336 This is more than losing old Frank.
10087405 10088770 Oh, Rhett...
10088840 10090205 I'm so afraid.
10090275 10092971 I don't believe it.<br />You've never been afraid in your life.
10093044 10094511 I'm afraid now.
10094779 10097407 I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
10098750 10101685 You look pretty healthy,<br />and maybe there isn't any hell.
10101753 10104950 Oh, there is. I know there is.<br />I was raised on it.
10105891 10109520 Well, far be it from me<br />to question the teachings of childhood.
10109594 10112893 Tell me what you've done<br />that hell yawns before you.
10113798 10116528 I ought never to have married Frank<br />to begin with.
10116601 10119661 He was Suellen's beau<br />and he loved her, not me.
10119971 10122701 And I made him miserable.<br />And I killed him.
10123241 10125175 Yes, I did. I killed him.
10128613 10133277 For the first time I'm finding out what it is<br />to be sorry for something I've done.
10133818 10135809 Here. Dry your eyes.
10136721 10139588 If you had it all to do over again,<br />you'd do no differently.
10139724 10142693 You're like the thief who isn't<br />the least bit sorry he stole...
10142761 10145753 but he's terribly, terribly sorry<br />he's going to jail.
10145830 10147798 I'm glad Mother's dead.
10148533 10151195 I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
10152137 10155300 I always wanted to be like her,<br />calm and kind and...
10156107 10159076 And I certainly have<br />turned out disappointing.
10160512 10164073 You know, Scarlett, I think<br />you're on the verge of a crying jag.
10172023 10175220 So I'll change the subject<br />and say what I came to say.
10175293 10177318 Say it, then, and get out!
10178196 10179185 What is it?
10179264 10182062 That I can't go on any longer without you.
10182133 10186229 You are the most ill-bred man to come<br />here at a time like this with your filthy...
10186304 10188898 I made up my mind that you were<br />the only woman for me...
10188974 10190635 the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.
10190709 10193234 Now that you've got the lumber mill<br />and Frank's money...
10193311 10195643 you won't come to me<br />as you did to the jail.
10195714 10197682 So I see I shall have to marry you.
10198350 10200215 I never heard of such bad taste.
10200285 10202480 Would you be more convinced<br />if I fell to my knees?
10202554 10204647 Turn me loose, you varmint,<br />and get out of here!
10204723 10207954 Forgive me for startling you<br />with the impetuosity of my sentiments...
10208026 10210551 my dear Scarlett.<br />I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
10210629 10213757 But it cannot have escaped your notice<br />that for some time past...
10213832 10217233 the friendship I have felt for you<br />has ripened into a deeper feeling.
10217302 10220703 A feeling more beautiful,<br />more pure, more sacred.
10221806 10223899 Dare I name it? Can it be love?
10224542 10227136 Get up off your knees.<br />I don't like your common jokes.
10227212 10229077 This is an honorable proposal<br />of marriage...
10229147 10231672 made at what I consider<br />a most opportune moment.
10232651 10235620 I can't go all my life waiting<br />to catch you between husbands.
10236254 10238415 You're coarse, and you're conceited.
10239424 10241984 And I think this conversation<br />has gone far enough.
10242927 10245395 Besides, I shall never marry again.
10246464 10249160 Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.
10249501 10251230 You? You?
10251970 10253335 I don't love you!
10253838 10256102 And I don't like being married.
10257075 10259475 Did you ever think<br />of marrying just for fun?
10259544 10262980 Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.<br />Fun for men, you mean.
10263782 10265807 Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?
10265884 10268318 You've been married to a boy<br />and an old man.
10268386 10271446 Why not try a husband of the right age,<br />with a way with women?
10272324 10276818 You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know<br />I shall always love another man.
10278163 10281792 Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?<br />Stop it! No more of that talk.
10287806 10289273 Rhett, don't, I shall faint.
10289341 10292105 I want you to faint.<br />This is what you were meant for.
10292177 10295374 None of the fools you've known<br />have kissed you like this, have they?
10295447 10298041 Your Charles, or your Frank,<br />or your stupid Ashley.
10306224 10309489 Say you're going to marry me.<br />Say "yes. " Say "yes. "
10309561 10310585 Yes.
10312731 10315393 Are you sure you meant it?<br />You don't want to take it back?
10315467 10316491 No.
10317135 10319763 Look at me and try to tell me the truth.
10319838 10322363 Did you say "yes" because of my money?
10322440 10323429 Well...
10323742 10325175 Yes. Partly.
10326378 10327470 Partly?
10328179 10332912 Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,<br />and of course I am fond of you.
10333084 10334108 Fond of me?
10334185 10337677 If I said I was madly in love with you,<br />you'd know I was lying...
10337756 10339781 but you always said<br />we had a lot in common...
10339858 10341519 Yes, you're right, my dear.
10341593 10344061 I'm not in love with you any more<br />than you are with me.
10344129 10346859 Heaven help the man<br />who ever really loves you.
10346931 10349024 What kind of a ring would you like,<br />my darling?
10349100 10352297 A diamond ring.<br />And do buy a great big one, Rhett.
10352370 10355271 You shall have the biggest<br />and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
10355340 10358070 We'll go to New Orleans<br />for the most expensive honeymoon...
10358143 10359303 my ill-gotten gains can buy.
10359377 10361038 That would be just heavenly.
10361112 10363307 And I think I'll buy your trousseau<br />for you, too.
10363381 10365508 Rhett, how wonderful, but...
10365683 10368243 you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?
10368319 10370344 Still the little hypocrite.
10372457 10374482 Aren't you going to kiss me goodbye?
10374559 10377323 Don't you think you've had enough kissing<br />for one afternoon?
10377395 10378487 You're impossible.
10378563 10380963 You can go and I don't care<br />if you never come back.
10381032 10382829 But I will come back.
10397348 10399407 What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
10399517 10402042 I'm thinking about how rich we are.
10403388 10405720 Rhett, I can keep<br />the lumber business too, can't I?
10405790 10407951 Yes, of course you can, if it amuses you.
10408026 10410995 Now that you're rich<br />you can tell everyone to go to the devil...
10411062 10412654 as you've always said you wanted to.
10412730 10415198 But you were the main one<br />I wanted to go to the devil.
10433151 10436848 Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.<br />I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
10436921 10440823 Rhett, can I have one of those<br />chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?
10440892 10444225 If you don't stop being such a glutton,<br />you'll get as fat as Mammy.
10444295 10445626 Then I'll divorce you.
10446564 10449294 Wouldn't it be nice if you bought<br />something for Mammy, too?
10449367 10453030 Why should I buy her a present<br />when she called us both mules?
10453104 10454537 Mules? Why mules?
10454606 10458372 Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,<br />and get ourselves all slicked up...
10458443 10461071 like racehorses but we were just mules<br />in horse harness...
10461145 10463238 and we didn't fool anybody.
10463615 10465412 I never heard anything more true.
10465483 10467280 Mammy's a smart old soul...
10467352 10470651 and one of the few people I know<br />whose respect I'd like to have.
10471389 10473619 I won't give her a thing.<br />She doesn't deserve it.
10473691 10475454 Then I'll take her a petticoat.
10475527 10477722 My Mammy always said<br />when she went to heaven...
10477795 10481754 she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,<br />so stiff that it would stand by itself...
10481833 10485064 and so rustly, the Lord would think<br />it was made of angels' wings.
10485136 10488299 Well, she won't take it from you.<br />She'd rather die than wear it.
10488373 10491137 That may be, but I'm making the gesture<br />just the same.
10495847 10498042 Wake up! Wake up!
10499984 10502452 You were having another nightmare.
10503021 10504386 Oh, Rhett.
10504455 10506650 I was so cold and hungry...
10506724 10508385 and so tired I...
10508826 10512785 I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist<br />and I couldn't find it.
10513631 10516156 - Find what, honey?<br />- I don't know.
10516401 10519461 I always dream the same dream<br />and I never know.
10519571 10521562 It seems to be hidden in the mist.
10521639 10522731 Darling.
10524042 10528172 Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream<br />that I've found it and that I'm safe?
10529514 10533610 Dreams don't work that way, but when<br />you get used to being safe and warm...
10534085 10536315 you'll stop dreaming that dream.
10536387 10539754 And, Scarlett, I'm going to see<br />that you are safe.
10543728 10546390 Would you do something<br />for me if I asked you?
10546464 10548091 You know I would.
10548900 10551198 Will you take me away from here?
10551536 10553003 Don't you like New Orleans?
10553071 10557167 I love New Orleans,<br />but I want to go home and visit Tara.
10558009 10560034 Will you take me to Tara?
10560378 10564872 Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.<br />We'll go tomorrow.
10568286 10571084 You get your strength<br />from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.
10571155 10573214 You're part of it, and it's part of you.
10573291 10577022 Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara<br />the way it was before the war.
10577095 10579996 Would you?<br />Then go ahead and make it that way.
10580531 10583830 Spend whatever you want,<br />make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
10584435 10585925 Oh, Rhett.
10586537 10588300 Rhett, you are good to me.
10588373 10590705 And can we still have<br />our big new house in Atlanta?
10590775 10593335 Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want:
10593811 10596177 Marble terraces, stained-glass windows<br />and all.
10596247 10598147 Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?
10598216 10601617 I want everybody who's been mean to me<br />to be pea-green with envy.
10603187 10607351 I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,<br />building that new house just to show off...
10607492 10609722 and even taking our servants.
10610695 10613596 Oh, darling, you mustn't think<br />unkindly of her.
10614065 10617091 She's made it possible for us<br />to keep Tara always.
10617168 10619159 Yes, and what good is Tara?
10619237 10622798 She's had three husbands<br />and I'll be an old maid.
10625810 10627641 Great Jehoshaphat!
10628446 10630141 Great Jehoshaphat!
10630581 10632412 Lordsy, we sure is rich now!
10632483 10633814 It ain't quality.
10634352 10636547 But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?
10637021 10639751 I'm entitled to at least see<br />what my own child looks like.
10639824 10643590 You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.<br />You'll be seeing it for a long time.
10644128 10646961 I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,<br />about it's not being a boy.
10647031 10649397 Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.<br />Who wants a boy?
10649467 10652664 Boys aren't any use to anybody.<br />Don't you think I'm proof of that?
10653438 10655269 Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.
10655339 10657864 Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
10658176 10659507 She sure is.
10660411 10662038 Did you ever see a prettier one?
10662113 10666413 Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh<br />that pretty when she come, but not quite.
10666484 10668509 Have another glass, Mammy.
10672590 10674683 What's that rustling noise I hear?
10674759 10678991 Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothing but<br />my red silk petticoat you done give me.
10679063 10682157 Nothing but your petticoat?<br />I don't believe it. Let me see.
10682233 10683825 Pull up your skirt.
10683901 10686096 Mr. Rhett, you is bad.
10686537 10687765 Yeah, oh, Lord!
10693711 10696874 You sure took a long enough time<br />about wearing it.
10696948 10698575 Yes, sir, too long.
10699283 10701478 No more mule in horse's harness?
10701552 10704783 Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad<br />telling you about that.
10704856 10707791 You ain't holding that<br />against old Mammy, is you?
10707859 10710692 No, I ain't holding it against you.<br />I just wanted to know.
10710762 10713663 Have another glass, Mammy.<br />Here, take the whole bottle.
10713731 10716723 Dr. Meade says you may go in now,<br />Capt. Butler.
10720071 10722232 This sure is a happy day to me.
10722306 10725537 I done diapered three generations<br />of this family's girls...
10725610 10727669 and it sure is a happy day.
10727845 10731212 Oh, yes, Mammy.<br />The happiest days are when babies come.
10731282 10732681 I wish...
10733017 10736180 Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.<br />What do you suppose they'll name her?
10736287 10738687 Miss Scarlett done told me<br />if it was a girl...
10738790 10742021 she's going to name it Eugenie Victoria.
10742693 10743921 Yes...
10743995 10745929 she's a beautiful baby...
10746697 10749097 the most beautiful baby ever.
10750168 10751362 Yes.
10752904 10755236 Do you know that this is your birthday?
10755940 10758101 That you're a week old today?
10758743 10763578 Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes<br />of which this town has never seen.
10764615 10768142 Yes, I'm gonna send her<br />to the best schools in Charleston.
10768219 10772246 Yes. And her'll be received<br />by the best families in the South.
10773090 10775581 And when it comes time for her to marry...
10775660 10778595 well, she'll be a little princess.
10779497 10781692 You certainly are making a fool of yourself.
10781766 10783028 And why shouldn't I?
10784068 10787367 She's the first person<br />who's ever completely belonged to me.
10788372 10790067 Great balls of fire!
10790141 10791972 I had the baby, didn't I?
10792610 10794168 It's Melanie. May I come in?
10794245 10795405 Come in, Melly.
10795479 10799142 Yes, come in and look at my daughter's<br />beautiful blue eyes.
10800785 10803879 But, Capt. Butler, most babies<br />have blue eyes when they're born.
10803988 10807048 Don't try to tell him anything.<br />He knows everything about babies.
10807124 10810321 Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br />and they're going to stay blue.
10810394 10812726 As blue as the Bonnie Blue Flag.
10813297 10815788 That's it. That's what we'll call her.
10815867 10817596 Bonnie Blue Butler.
10825841 10827433 Try again, Mammy.
10835050 10836176 Twenty inches.
10836685 10839745 Twenty inches!<br />I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
10839821 10842619 You've simply got to make it<br />18.5 again, Mammy.
10842691 10844283 You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...
10844359 10846850 and you ain't never going to be<br />no 18.5 inches again.
10846929 10849921 Never. And there ain't nothing<br />to do about it.
10850499 10852660 There is something to do about it!
10852734 10856067 I'm just not going to get old and fat<br />before my time.
10856471 10858871 I just won't have any more babies!
10859341 10863072 I heard Mr. Rhett say<br />that he'll be wanting a son next year.
10863145 10865978 Go tell Capt. Butler<br />I've decided not to go out after all.
10866048 10867982 I'll have supper in my room.
10888337 10892068 I got your message. I'll have them bring<br />my supper up here, too.
10899081 10900776 No objections to that, I hope?
10900882 10902008 No.
10903285 10904445 Yes.
10906254 10909155 I mean, I don't care<br />where you have your supper.
10911393 10912417 Rhett?
10913295 10914319 Yes?
10914396 10915727 You see...
10915998 10917898 well, I've decided...
10919901 10922802 well, I hope I don't have<br />any more children.
10935017 10937918 My pet, as I told you<br />before Bonnie was born...
10938820 10941812 it's immaterial to me<br />whether you have one child or 20!
10941923 10944016 No, but you know what I...
10944159 10945751 Do you know what I mean?
10945827 10948887 I do. And do you know<br />I can divorce you for this?
10949865 10952356 You're just low enough<br />to think of something like that!
10952434 10956370 If you had any chivalry in you or would<br />be nice, like... Well, Ashley Wilkes!
10956438 10958963 Melanie can't have any more children<br />and he...
10961076 10963909 You've been to the lumber office<br />this afternoon, haven't you?
10963979 10966311 What has that got to do with it?
10967215 10970673 Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br />Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.
10970752 10972982 It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
10974289 10976280 You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
10976358 10977518 Sorry for me?
10977592 10980891 Yes, because you're throwing away<br />happiness with both hands...
10980962 10983726 and reaching out for something<br />that'll never make you happy.
10983799 10985528 I don't know what you're talking about.
10985600 10988831 If you were free and Melly were dead<br />and you had your precious...
10988904 10991805 honorable Ashley, do you think<br />you'd be happy with him?
10992674 10996132 You'd never know him,<br />never even understand his mind...
10996411 10999312 any more than you understand anything<br />except money.
10999381 11001645 Never mind about that!<br />What I want to know is...
11001717 11005585 You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.<br />It'll work no hardship on me.
11006054 11007612 Do you mean to say you don't care?
11007689 11011420 The world is full of many things<br />and many people, and I shan't be lonely.
11011993 11013927 I'll find comfort elsewhere.
11013995 11015986 Well, that's fine. But I warn you.
11016064 11019227 Just in case you change your mind,<br />I intend to lock my door.
11019301 11022759 Why bother? If I wanted to come in,<br />no lock could keep me out!
11041389 11044790 I always knew that most women<br />were cheats, hypocritical and hard.
11044860 11047294 - But this one...<br />- Rhett, it ain't no use.
11047362 11050263 - What do you mean?<br />- I mean you're poisoned with her.
11050332 11053529 I don't care what she's done to you,<br />you're still in love with her.
11053602 11055661 And don't think it pleasures me none<br />to say it.
11055737 11058638 Maybe so! But I'm through with her,<br />I tell you! I'm through.
11058707 11062370 You gotta think of the child.<br />The child's worth ten of the mother.
11068650 11071881 You're a shrewd woman, Belle,<br />and a very nice one.
11073522 11074511 Yes, Rhett?
11074589 11078150 I was just thinking of the difference<br />between you and...
11078226 11081684 You're both hardheaded businesswomen<br />and you're both successful.
11081763 11083856 But you've got a heart, Belle...
11085500 11087127 and you're honest.
11089571 11091129 Goodbye, Rhett.
11092040 11093598 Goodbye, Belle.
11109157 11111318 She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!
11111560 11113585 Look at those hands, and that seat!
11113829 11114887 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
11114963 11118296 Why do we have to wheel a baby<br />when there are servants...
11118366 11119765 Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
11119835 11121029 Good morning, Capt. Butler.
11121102 11122433 Good morning, Scarlett.
11122504 11125098 Making fools of ourselves<br />in front of these old buffaloes!
11125173 11128665 If you'd thought of your position<br />years ago, you wouldn't have to do this.
11128743 11133180 But as it is, we'll cultivate every female<br />dragon of the old guard in this town.
11133615 11135105 Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
11135183 11138482 Good morning, Capt. Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
11139254 11142485 So the millionaire speculator<br />is turning respectable!
11142624 11144888 All of our money can't buy<br />what I want for Bonnie.
11144960 11147190 Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.
11147262 11149787 But Bonnie's going to have her place<br />among decent people.
11149865 11153460 Yes, even if we both have to crawl<br />on our bellies to every fat old cat.
11154236 11155931 Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
11156238 11158900 Good morning, Capt. Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
11165113 11168241 Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had<br />a great regard for your knowledge.
11168316 11170045 I wonder if you could give me<br />some advice.
11170118 11171176 Certainly.
11171253 11173585 My Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br />I can't make her stop it.
11173655 11176089 Make her stop it.<br />It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
11176157 11177249 I know, I know.
11177325 11180954 She has such a beautiful mouth, too.<br />I tried putting soap under her nails.
11181029 11182121 Soap! Bah!
11182197 11185689 Put quinine on her thumb<br />and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
11185934 11188732 Quinine! I never would have thought of it.
11188803 11190998 I can't thank you enough,<br />Mrs. Merriwether.
11191072 11194166 You've taken a great load off my mind!<br />Good morning.
11197779 11199269 Good morning, Dolly.
11199347 11200974 Wasn't that Capt. Butler?
11201049 11203916 Good morning, Caroline.<br />I was just thinking.
11203985 11208081 There must be a great deal of good<br />in a man who could love a child so much.
11208156 11210021 But of course there is!
11210091 11213857 Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing<br />told Dr. Meade that Capt. Butler...
11213929 11216762 finally admitted he was honored<br />by the Confederate Congress...
11216831 11218856 for his services at the Battle of Franklin?
11218934 11222062 No! And did I tell you, Caroline,<br />that Capt. Butler...
11222137 11225698 made a stupendous contribution<br />to the Association for the Beautification...
11225774 11227708 of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
11227776 11228834 No.
11229511 11233277 My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,<br />is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
11233348 11236146 Why, Dolly Merriwether,<br />you know right well it was my idea...
11236217 11237741 to give a party for Bonnie Butler.
11237819 11239150 Why Caroline Meade...
11248263 11251699 Now watch Daddy put your pony over,<br />Bonnie. Now watch.
11254436 11256734 Daddy, let me! Let me!
11256905 11259499 All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!
11262944 11264206 Up we go.
11264412 11265709 Oh, there!
11266014 11268505 Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!
11268583 11272280 Grip tightly with your legs. Sit close.<br />Lean forward. Be sure you go with him.
11272354 11275118 Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.<br />Up!
11275991 11278118 That was fine! I knew you'd do it!
11278193 11281390 When you get a little older,<br />I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
11281463 11285365 You'll be the greatest horsewoman<br />in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
11286067 11287830 Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!
11288470 11289630 Mr. Rhett!
11290538 11293132 Did you see her, Mammy?<br />Wasn't she wonderful?
11293208 11297144 Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you<br />it just ain't fitting...
11297212 11300409 for a girl child to ride astraddle<br />with her dress flying up!
11300482 11302848 All right, Mammy.<br />I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
11302917 11306148 And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.<br />She'll love that.
11306221 11308519 A nice black broadcloth<br />is what little girls wear.
11308590 11310717 Now, Mammy, be reasonable.
11311226 11313421 Well, I don't think it's fitting, but...
11315463 11318125 It ain't fitting, it just ain't fitting.
11319100 11320397 It ain't fitting.
11330879 11332346 Why, Scarlett!
11332680 11334807 What are you doing downtown<br />at this time of day?
11334883 11335941 Ashley, I just...
11336017 11339578 Why aren't you helping Melly get ready<br />for my surprise birthday party?
11339654 11343249 Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed<br />to know anything about that.
11343324 11346054 Melly'd be so disappointed<br />if you weren't surprised.
11346127 11349585 I won't let on.<br />I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
11350298 11352630 As long as you're here,<br />let me show you the books...
11352700 11355498 so you can see just how bad<br />a businessman I really am.
11355570 11357731 Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.
11357806 11360604 When I'm wearing a new bonnet,<br />all the figures I ever knew...
11360675 11362404 go right slap out of my head.
11362477 11366106 The figures are well lost<br />when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.
11366181 11369150 Scarlett, you know,<br />you get prettier all the time.
11370118 11373952 You haven't changed a bit since the day<br />of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
11374489 11377856 where you sat under a tree<br />surrounded by dozens of beaux.
11379494 11381894 That girl doesn't exist anymore.
11382397 11385230 Nothing's turned out<br />as I expected, Ashley.
11385300 11386597 Nothing.
11387102 11391402 Yes, we've traveled a long road<br />since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?
11391473 11393202 Oh, the lazy days...
11393274 11395799 the warm, still country twilights...
11396778 11400009 the high, soft Negro laughter<br />from the quarters...
11400582 11403813 the golden warmth and security<br />of those days.
11406054 11408045 Don't look back, Ashley.
11408256 11409883 Don't look back.
11411559 11416258 It drags at your heart<br />till you can't do anything but look back.
11421402 11424098 I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
11424772 11428264 I never want you to be anything<br />but completely happy.
11448229 11449287 Oh, Ashley!
11451799 11452891 Who is it?
11452967 11454628 Only your husband.
11455270 11456532 Come in.
11457572 11460666 Am I actually being invited<br />into the sanctuary?
11461342 11463742 You're not ready for Melanie's party.
11463811 11465335 I've got a headache, Rhett.
11465413 11468610 You go without me<br />and make my excuses to Melanie.
11469884 11473411 What a white-livered little coward<br />you are. Get up.
11473488 11475820 You're going to that party<br />and you'll have to hurry.
11475890 11477482 - Has India dared to...<br />- Yes. India has!
11477559 11479493 Every woman and man in town<br />knows the story!
11479561 11481188 You should kill them, spreading lies.
11481262 11484095 I have a strange way of not killing people<br />who tell the truth.
11484165 11485689 There's no time to argue. Get up!
11485767 11488736 I won't go! I can't go<br />till this misunderstanding is cleared up.
11488803 11491499 Don't cheat Melly<br />out of the satisfaction of publicly...
11491573 11492870 ordering you out of her house.
11492941 11494806 There was nothing wrong.<br />India hates me so.
11494876 11496639 I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.
11496711 11500203 If you don't go, you won't be able<br />to show your face as long as you live.
11500281 11503182 That wouldn't bother me, but<br />you won't ruin Bonnie's chances.
11503251 11507017 You're going to that party,<br />if only for her sake. Now get dressed!
11520134 11524002 Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly<br />will do for this occasion.
11524072 11527269 And put on plenty of rouge.<br />I want you to look your part tonight.
11534349 11539218 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
11539654 11544455 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
11545126 11548823 <i>Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
11549564 11551998 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
11553801 11556326 - Good night, Scarlett.<br />- But Rhett, you can't...
11556404 11559373 You go into the arena alone.<br />The lions are hungry for you.
11559440 11561169 Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.
11561242 11562539 You're not afraid?
11562610 11564737 <i>Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
11564812 11569374 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow</i>
11569484 11573921 <i>For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny</i>
11589270 11591568 What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.
11591639 11593300 India wasn't able to come tonight.
11593374 11594602 Will you be an angel?
11594676 11597907 I do need you to help me<br />receive my guests.
11600982 11602415 Mrs. Meade...
11602650 11604811 here's our darling Scarlett.
11606321 11607379 Good evening.
11607488 11608750 Good evening.
11608823 11610222 Why, Scarlett!
11610658 11613525 - Good evening, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good evening, Mrs. Butler.
11614295 11617787 Ashley, aren't you going to get<br />our Scarlett a glass of punch?
11625373 11628308 Did you have a good time tonight<br />at Miss Melly's party, child?
11628376 11629400 Yes, yes.
11629477 11631342 Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word.
11631412 11634506 If Capt. Butler asks for me<br />when he comes back, I'm asleep.
11634882 11636144 Yes, ma'am.
11665313 11667110 Come in, Mrs. Butler.
11676124 11677455 Come here.
11693141 11694165 Sit down!
11696844 11700280 There's no reason why you shouldn't have<br />your nightcap even if I am here.
11700348 11702782 I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and...
11702850 11705114 You heard nothing of the kind.
11705186 11707984 You wouldn't have come down<br />if you'd thought I was here.
11708055 11710285 - You must need a drink badly.<br />- I do not!
11710358 11713156 Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
11713227 11716287 I know you drink on the quiet,<br />and I know how much you drink.
11716731 11719029 Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
11725807 11727502 You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!
11727575 11729065 I'm very drunk...
11729410 11732607 and I intend getting still drunker<br />before the evening's over...
11733414 11736144 but you're not going to bed, not yet.
11737418 11738544 Sit down.
11741756 11743690 So she stood by you, did she?
11744926 11748521 How does it feel to have the woman<br />you've wronged cloak your sins for you?
11750198 11753167 You're wondering if she knows<br />all about you and Ashley.
11753434 11756028 You're wondering if she did it<br />just to save her face.
11756437 11760305 You're thinking that she's a fool for<br />doing it even if it did save your hide.
11760374 11762535 - I will not listen.<br />- Yes, you'll listen!
11763611 11766011 Miss Melly's a fool,<br />but not the kind you think.
11766614 11770209 It's just that there's too much honor in her<br />to ever conceive of dishonor...
11770284 11771876 in anyone she loves.
11772653 11774245 And she loves you.
11774689 11777522 Though just why she does,<br />I'm sure I don't know!
11778693 11781958 If you weren't so drunk and insulting,<br />I could explain everything.
11782430 11785490 - As it is, though...<br />- If you get out of that chair once more...
11789737 11794367 Of course, the comic figure in all this<br />is the long-suffering Mr. Wilkes.
11795409 11798378 Mr. Wilkes, who can't be<br />mentally faithful to his wife...
11798479 11801039 and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
11802717 11804480 Why doesn't he make up his mind?
11804585 11806075 Rhett, you...
11809123 11811523 Observe my hands, my dear.
11812527 11814961 I could tear you to pieces with them.
11815630 11819157 And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley<br />out of your mind forever.
11820234 11821792 But it wouldn't.
11822637 11826403 So I'll remove him<br />from your mind forever this way.
11827608 11829701 I'll put my hands so...
11830578 11832705 one on each side of your head...
11833714 11837775 and I'll smash your skull between them<br />like a walnut.
11838586 11840816 That'll block him out.
11842089 11844785 Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.
11850064 11853295 You know I've always admired<br />your spirit, my dear.
11854268 11857032 Never more than now,<br />when you're cornered.
11857738 11859103 I'm not cornered.
11859173 11862006 You'll never corner me,<br />Rhett Butler, or frighten me!
11862076 11865568 You've lived in dirt so long,<br />you can't understand anything else.
11865646 11869377 And you're jealous of something<br />you can't understand. Good night!
11871919 11873284 Jealous, am I?
11873387 11875184 Yes, I suppose I am.
11875790 11879282 Even though I know<br />you've been faithful to me all along.
11879427 11880655 How do I know?
11880795 11883958 Because I know Ashley Wilkes<br />and his honorable breed.
11884565 11886157 They're gentlemen.
11886300 11889531 And that's more than I can say<br />for you or for me.
11889971 11893498 We're not gentlemen,<br />and we have no honor, have we?
11903150 11905243 It's not that easy, Scarlett.
11909223 11911555 You turned me out<br />while you chased Ashley Wilkes...
11911626 11913423 while you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.
11913494 11915724 This is one night<br />you're not turning me out.
11944225 11946352 How are you feeling<br />this morning, Mammy?
11946427 11950295 Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.
11953267 11955792 You acting mighty happy this morning,<br />Miss Scarlett.
11955936 11957403 I am, Mammy. I am.
11964545 11969380 <i>Oh, she wept with delight<br />when he gave her a smile</i>
11969884 11973843 <i>And trembled with fear at his frown</i>
11991338 11992362 Hello.
11995209 11998804 I'd like to extend my apology<br />for my conduct of last night.
11999080 12000707 Oh, but Rhett...
12000781 12002009 I was very drunk...
12002083 12005348 and quite swept off my feet<br />by your charms.
12007788 12011349 Well, you needn't bother to apologize.<br />Nothing you ever do surprises me!
12011859 12014657 I've been thinking things over,<br />and I really believe that...
12014729 12016253 it would be better for both of us...
12016330 12019060 if we admitted we'd made a mistake<br />and got a divorce.
12019400 12020867 - A divorce?<br />- Yes.
12020935 12023631 There's no point in our holding on<br />to each other, is there?
12023704 12026104 I'll provide for you amply.<br />You've plenty of grounds.
12026173 12029142 Just give me Bonnie.<br />Say what you please. I won't contest.
12029210 12030199 Thank you very much.
12030277 12033303 But I wouldn't dream<br />of disgracing my family with a divorce.
12034048 12036539 You'd disgrace it quick enough<br />if Ashley were free.
12036617 12039609 It makes my head spin to think<br />how quickly you'd divorce me.
12040755 12042154 Wouldn't you, Scarlett?
12043591 12044819 Well, answer me.
12044892 12045916 Wouldn't you?
12045993 12048223 Will you please go now<br />and leave me alone?
12049764 12052562 Yes, I'm going.<br />That's what I came to tell you.
12053100 12057230 I'm going on a very extended trip<br />to London, and I'm leaving today.
12057838 12059499 And I'm taking Bonnie with me.
12059573 12062064 So you'll please<br />get her little duds packed right away.
12062143 12064668 You'll never take my child<br />out of this house.
12064745 12066610 She's my child, too, Scarlett.
12066714 12068272 I wouldn't leave her here...
12068349 12071546 with a mother who hasn't the decency<br />to consider her own reputation.
12071619 12073109 You're a fine one to talk.
12073187 12075087 You think I'll let her out of this house...
12075156 12078751 when you'll probably have her around<br />with people like that Belle?
12078826 12081192 If you were a man<br />I'd break your neck for that.
12081462 12083760 As it is, I'll thank you<br />to shut your stupid mouth.
12083831 12086800 As for you, giving yourself pious airs<br />about your motherhood...
12086867 12088801 Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.
12088869 12092100 Have her things packed and ready<br />for me in an hour, or I warn you...
12092173 12096075 I've always thought a good lashing with a<br />buggy whip would benefit you immensely.
12101482 12103074 Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
12103717 12104809 Hello, Uncle Rhett.
12104885 12106352 Hello, hello, Beau.
12106420 12107978 Daddy, Daddy.
12108155 12111613 Where have you been?<br />I've been waiting for you all morning.
12111692 12115219 Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin<br />to wrap my little Bonnie in.
12115396 12117694 Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
12120734 12123828 I'm going to take you<br />on a long trip to fairyland.
12124872 12126169 Where? Where?
12126574 12130169 I'm going to show you the Tower<br />of London, where the little princes were...
12130477 12132138 and London Bridge.
12132479 12133912 London Bridge!
12134014 12135811 Will it be falling down?
12137218 12139482 Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
12142122 12144249 Daddy, dark!
12145626 12147116 Dark!
12147294 12149285 Daddy! Dark!
12150364 12153094 It's all right.<br />Who put out that light? Nurse!
12153167 12154600 Daddy, dark!
12155903 12156995 Daddy, dark!
12157071 12158732 There. Yes, yes.
12159306 12161206 What's the matter with my Bonnie?
12161275 12162572 A bear.
12163010 12165274 Oh, a bear? A big bear?
12165746 12168647 Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.
12168749 12172048 Well, I'll stay here and shoot him<br />if he comes back.
12187268 12189236 Good evening, Mr. Butler.
12192106 12194700 Haven't I told you never to leave her alone<br />in the dark?
12194775 12198871 If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often<br />afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
12198946 12200811 Just let her scream for a night or two.
12200881 12204612 Let her scream! Either you're a fool or<br />the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!
12204685 12207449 Of course, if you want her<br />to grow up nervous and cowardly.
12207521 12208579 Cowardly!
12208656 12212023 There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.<br />You're discharged!
12212927 12214087 As you say, sir.
12231111 12232601 Where is Mother?
12239153 12241280 Aren't you happy here in London with me?
12241956 12244447 I want to go home.
12256637 12258002 Miss Bonnie.
12258305 12260239 And Capt. Butler.
12260507 12262532 - Miss Scarlett.<br />- Hello, Mammy.
12262609 12263837 Honey child.
12265245 12268043 Miss Scarlett! They's back.<br />They's back, Miss Scarlett.
12268215 12269409 Bonnie.
12270351 12272251 Bonnie. Bonnie, baby.
12272586 12273883 Darling baby.
12273954 12275353 Are you glad to be home?
12275422 12276980 Daddy gave me a kitten.
12277057 12280322 - What a lovely kitten.<br />- London's a horrid place.
12280861 12283125 - Oh, my darling.<br />- Where's my pony?
12283330 12286527 - I want to go out and see my pony.<br />- You go out and see your pony.
12296010 12297568 Where's my pony?
12298679 12300408 I wanna go out and see my pony.
12301148 12302775 You run along with Mammy.
12302850 12304442 - Come on, honey child.<br />- Go with Mammy.
12304518 12306509 Mammy sure has missed you, honey.
12308689 12310122 Mrs. Butler, I believe.
12311158 12312648 Mammy said you'd come back.
12314128 12315618 But only to bring Bonnie.
12315696 12319097 Apparently any mother, even a bad one,<br />is better for a child than none.
12319900 12321663 You mean you're going away again?
12322069 12323627 What perception, Mrs. Butler.
12324004 12325096 Right away.
12325239 12327571 In fact, I left my bags at the station.
12329410 12332607 You're looking pale.<br />Is there a shortage of rouge?
12332679 12335443 Or can this wanness mean<br />you've been missing me?
12336083 12337641 If I'm pale, it's your fault.
12337718 12340744 Not because I've been missing you,<br />but because...
12344458 12346392 Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
12347194 12349458 It's because I'm going to have a baby.
12355502 12356526 Indeed?
12357004 12358767 And who's the happy father?
12359573 12361063 You know it's yours.
12361141 12362938 I don't want it any more than you do.
12363010 12365171 No woman would want the child<br />of a cad like you.
12365245 12367941 I wish it were anybody's child but yours.
12369917 12372249 Well, cheer up.<br />Maybe you'll have an accident.
12386867 12388391 Is she better?
12392606 12394005 Has she asked for me?
12394074 12396167 Don't you understand? She's delirious.
12397711 12399508 Rhett.
12400781 12402408 I want Rhett.
12406687 12410088 What's the matter, honey?<br />Did you call somebody, child?
12410157 12411590 It's no use.
12412860 12414020 It's no use.
12436183 12437741 Dr. Meade's left.
12438852 12440183 Scarlett's dead!
12440254 12441983 Oh, no, she's much better.
12442556 12443887 Really, she is.
12460607 12463701 There, there, Capt. Butler.<br />You're beside yourself.
12463777 12466007 She'll very soon be well again,<br />I promise you.
12466079 12469048 No, you don't understand.<br />She never wanted this baby.
12469249 12471740 Not want a baby?<br />Why, every woman wants a baby!
12471818 12474685 Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.<br />Not my children.
12475088 12477215 She told me she didn't want<br />any more children...
12477291 12479350 and I wanted to hurt her<br />because she'd hurt me.
12479426 12480723 I wanted to and I did.
12480794 12483786 Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.<br />It's not fit.
12483864 12486833 I didn't know about this baby<br />until the other day when she fell.
12486900 12489892 If I'd known, I'd have come home<br />whether she wanted me or not!
12489970 12491699 Well, of course you would.
12491772 12495572 And then when she told me,<br />there on the steps, what did I do?
12495642 12498440 What did I say? I laughed and I said...
12498512 12501675 But you didn't mean it.<br />I know you didn't mean it.
12501815 12504648 Oh, but I did mean it.<br />I was crazy with jealousy.
12504718 12508313 She's never cared for me. I thought<br />I could make her care, but I couldn't.
12510190 12511851 You're so wrong.
12511925 12515258 Scarlett loves you a great deal,<br />much more than she knows.
12516830 12518798 If that were only true I could wait forever.
12518865 12521163 If she'd only forgive me,<br />forget this ever happened.
12521235 12522463 She will.
12522603 12524195 You must be patient.
12526607 12528302 Oh, no, it's not possible.
12528375 12531867 You don't understand.<br />If you only knew who she really loved...
12532512 12534446 you wouldn't believe it.
12537384 12539978 Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
12540053 12542886 No, Capt. Butler, I wouldn't believe it.
12544625 12548994 There, there. Scarlett's going to get well<br />and there can be other babies.
12549296 12553027 No, she couldn't even if she wanted to,<br />after what she's been through.
12553100 12555068 But of course she could.
12555602 12557001 I'm going to.
12559940 12563171 No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.<br />It's too dangerous.
12563644 12566704 Children are life-renewing itself,<br />Capt. Butler...
12566780 12570272 and when life does that,<br />danger seems very unimportant.
12573387 12576481 I've never before known anyone<br />who was really brave.
12577257 12580192 I pray God things go well with you,<br />Miss Melly.
12580360 12584194 And I want to thank you for all<br />you've done for me and for Scarlett.
12585332 12587323 From my heart, I thank you.
12594074 12597373 Miss Scarlett's feeling<br />a heap better today, Mr. Rhett.
12597444 12598911 Thank you, Mammy.
12606119 12608383 I've come to ask your forgiveness...
12608455 12611356 in the hope that we can give<br />our life together another chance.
12611425 12613017 Our life together?
12613093 12615493 When did we ever have a life together?
12616530 12618191 Yes, you're right.
12618665 12622123 But I'm sure if we could only try again,<br />we could be happy.
12622836 12625566 What is there to make us happy now?
12626039 12628200 Well, there's Bonnie and...
12629242 12631233 and I love you, Scarlett.
12631545 12633308 When did you discover that?
12633380 12637316 I've always loved you, but you've never<br />given me a chance to show it.
12638452 12640886 Well, and just what do you want me to do?
12642723 12645351 To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.
12645726 12646886 We'll go away.
12646960 12649190 We'll take Bonnie<br />and have another honeymoon.
12649262 12651992 Give up the mill? Why?<br />It's making more money than ever.
12652065 12653999 Yes, I know, but we don't need it.
12654067 12656900 Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.
12656970 12658904 Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.
12658972 12661805 Always Melanie! If you'd think<br />a little more about me...
12661875 12663206 I am thinking of you...
12664277 12666074 and I'm thinking that...
12666279 12669510 well, maybe it's the mill<br />that's taking you away from me...
12669816 12671044 and from Bonnie.
12671118 12674110 I know what you're thinking.<br />Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.
12674187 12675882 You're the one taking her away from me.
12675956 12677082 But she loves you.
12677157 12679591 You've done everything<br />to make her love you, not me.
12679659 12680921 She's so spoiled now that...
12680994 12682461 Mommy! Daddy!
12682729 12683957 Watch me!
12684231 12686062 We're watching, darling.
12686133 12688101 You're mighty pretty, precious.
12688168 12689430 So are you.
12689836 12692464 I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.
12693206 12695902 I don't think you ought to do<br />much jumping yet, Bonnie.
12695976 12698308 Remember, you've just learned<br />to ride sidesaddle.
12698378 12699709 I will so jump!
12699813 12702646 I can jump better than ever<br />'cause I've grown...
12702783 12704375 and I've moved the bar higher.
12704451 12706248 Don't let her do it, Rhett.
12706319 12710415 No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,<br />don't cry and blame me.
12711391 12712881 Rhett, stop her!
12714861 12715987 Bonnie!
12716797 12717786 Bonnie!
12719166 12720656 Just like Pa.
12724137 12725627 Just like Pa!
12726873 12727965 Bonnie!
12736550 12737676 Bonnie!
12738318 12739478 Bonnie!
12756136 12759105 Lordsy, Miss Melly.<br />I sure is glad you've come.
12761741 12764642 This house won't seem<br />the same without Bonnie.
12764711 12766576 How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
12766646 12769479 Miss Melly, this here done<br />broke her heart...
12770217 12772811 but I didn't fetch you here<br />on Miss Scarlett's account.
12772886 12777084 What that child got to stand,<br />the good Lord give her strength to stand.
12778658 12781024 It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
12784498 12786989 He done lost his mind<br />these last couple of days.
12787100 12788533 No, Mammy, no.
12789002 12792938 I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,<br />set such store on any child.
12793740 12796140 When Dr. Meade say her neck broke...
12796209 12799906 Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there<br />and shoot that poor pony...
12800881 12803907 and for a minute I think<br />he going to shoot hisself.
12803984 12805747 Oh, poor Capt. Butler.
12805819 12810552 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him<br />a murderer for teaching that child to jump.
12811057 12813821 She say, "You give me my baby<br />what you kill. "
12813894 12817625 And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't<br />never cared nothing about Miss Bonnie.
12818164 12822191 It like to turn my blood cold,<br />the things they say to one another.
12822702 12825193 Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
12827974 12829737 And then that night...
12830777 12834577 Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br />in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...
12835215 12836876 and he wouldn't even open the door...
12836950 12839180 when Miss Scarlett beat on it<br />and hollered to him.
12839252 12841516 And that's the way it's been<br />for two whole days.
12841621 12842815 Oh, Mammy.
12843924 12847416 And then this evening, Miss Scarlett,<br />she shout through the door...
12847494 12849758 and she say the funeral set<br />for tomorrow morning...
12849829 12852855 and he says, "You try that<br />and I kills you tomorrow.
12852933 12855902 "Do you think I's going to put my child...
12855969 12858233 "in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
12858305 12861001 Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.
12861074 12864737 Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.<br />He ain't going to let us bury that child.
12864811 12866802 You gotta help us, Miss Melly.
12866980 12868607 Oh, but I can't intrude.
12868682 12870946 If you can't help us, who can?
12871017 12874043 Mr. Rhett always set great store<br />by your opinion.
12876089 12877852 Please, Miss Melly.
12879426 12881326 I'll do what I can, Mammy.
12888001 12890435 Get away from that door,<br />and leave us alone.
12890503 12892528 It's Mrs. Wilkes, Capt. Butler.
12892606 12894198 Please let me in.
12894274 12896265 I've come to see Bonnie.
12917230 12918595 Oh, Lord...
12919032 12922058 please help Mr. Rhett<br />in this hour of his grief.
12934014 12937245 I want you to go and make<br />a good deal of strong coffee...
12937317 12940912 and bring it up to Capt. Butler.<br />I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
12941388 12942616 But...
12942789 12946088 Capt. Butler is quite willing<br />for the funeral to take place...
12946159 12947353 tomorrow morning.
12947427 12952160 Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights<br />on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.
12953466 12955093 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
12955702 12956828 Miss Melly!
12956903 12958564 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
12960306 12962274 Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...
12962976 12964238 and try...
12964310 12965971 try to get me home.
12967681 12969239 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
12977090 12979490 Where is my mother going away to?
12979659 12982560 And why can't I go along, please?
12983096 12986429 We can't always go along, Beau,<br />much as we may want to.
12988134 12990329 You're going back to bed now.
12990970 12994167 Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!
12994908 12996307 She hasn't your strength.
12996376 12999675 She's never had any strength.<br />She's never had anything but heart.
13000180 13001613 You knew that, too.
13001681 13004514 Why do I have to go back to bed?<br />It's morning.
13005218 13007243 It isn't really morning yet.
13013493 13015154 You may come in now, Scarlett.
13015228 13016786 Please let me see her!
13016863 13020492 I've been waiting here two whole days<br />and I've got to tell her...
13020834 13022461 that I was wrong about something.
13022535 13025561 She knows you were wrong.<br />She wants to see Scarlett.
13029142 13030837 Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
13030910 13033708 I won't have you easing your conscience<br />telling her things...
13033780 13036146 that make no difference now.<br />You understand?
13051097 13052428 It's me, Melly.
13054167 13055566 Promise me?
13056236 13057225 Anything.
13058505 13060268 Look after my little son.
13061674 13063938 I gave him to you once before.
13065044 13066511 Remember?
13067380 13069007 The day he was born.
13069382 13073011 Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<br />I know you'll get well.
13073453 13074750 Promise me...
13075355 13076447 college...
13076523 13080721 Yes, and Europe, and a pony,<br />whatever he wants. But...
13081895 13083419 Melly, do try...
13083530 13084792 Ashley...
13086566 13088124 Ashley and you.
13090370 13093134 What about Ashley, Melly?
13094641 13096836 Look after him for me.
13097610 13099202 Just as you...
13100313 13103407 looked after me for him.
13105819 13107377 I will, Melly.
13108521 13110216 Look after him...
13110924 13113757 but never let him know.
13123903 13125302 Good night.
13126873 13128170 Promise?
13129542 13131169 What else, Melly?
13132011 13133774 Capt. Butler...
13135181 13136648 be kind to him.
13137350 13138374 Rhett?
13139219 13140846 He loves you so.
13144958 13146289 Yes, Melly.
13149295 13150626 Goodbye.
13151931 13153193 Goodbye.
13169249 13171308 You ladies may come in now.
13176723 13178054 Ashley.
13178925 13181519 I don't know where the mate to this is.
13182495 13184588 She must have put it away.
13185265 13186664 Oh, stop it.
13187233 13188325 Hold me.
13188735 13190327 I'm so frightened.
13192171 13193798 I'm so frightened.
13198745 13202545 Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?<br />I can't live without her, I can't.
13203917 13205817 Everything I ever had...
13205885 13207546 is going with her.
13208588 13209850 Oh, Ashley.
13211357 13213655 You really love her, don't you?
13214460 13219159 She's the only dream I ever had<br />that didn't die in the face of reality.
13219966 13223333 Dreams! Always dreams with you,<br />never common sense.
13223403 13226634 Oh, Scarlett!<br />If you knew what I've gone through!
13227340 13231436 Ashley, you should have told me years ago<br />that you loved her and not me...
13231511 13234446 and not left me dangling<br />with your talk of honor.
13234847 13238044 But you had to wait till now,<br />now when Melly's dying...
13238685 13242052 to show me that I could never mean<br />any more to you than...
13242121 13244817 than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
13246826 13249226 And I've loved something that...
13249329 13251388 that doesn't really exist.
13253900 13255128 Somehow...
13256469 13257834 I don't care.
13259372 13261067 Somehow it doesn't matter.
13263209 13265643 It doesn't matter one bit.
13269949 13271814 Ashley, forgive me.
13272185 13275086 Don't cry.<br />She mustn't see you've been crying.
13275621 13276883 Ashley!
13280293 13281590 Melly!
13283463 13284794 Melly!
13289235 13291226 Rhett, Rhett!
13294674 13296471 Rhett, where are you?
13300546 13301979 Rhett, wait for me.
13307053 13308520 Rhett, wait for me!
13335848 13337008 Rhett.
13340186 13341278 Come in.
13349295 13350557 Rhett...
13351030 13352588 Melanie, she's...
13356469 13357629 Well, God rest her.
13358404 13361532 She was the only completely kind person<br />I ever knew.
13362275 13363606 A great lady.
13364043 13365704 A very great lady.
13368081 13371482 So she's dead.<br />That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
13372318 13376049 Oh, how can you say such a thing?<br />You know how I loved her, really!
13377523 13379184 No, I don't know that I do.
13379258 13382785 But at least it's to your credit<br />that you could appreciate her at the end.
13382862 13386491 Of course I appreciated her.<br />She thought of everybody except herself.
13387300 13389131 Why, her last words were about you.
13390470 13391869 What did she say?
13391938 13393098 She said:
13393372 13396364 "Be kind to Capt. Butler. He loves you so. "
13402248 13403408 Did she say anything else?
13403483 13404973 She said...
13405418 13408080 She asked me to look after Ashley, too.
13410323 13413759 It's convenient to have<br />the first wife's permission, isn't it?
13415795 13417422 What do you mean?
13419732 13421495 What are you doing?
13421567 13423398 I'm leaving you, my dear.
13423469 13427337 All you need now is a divorce,<br />and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
13430409 13431967 Oh, no!
13432712 13434942 No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!
13435014 13438142 I don't want a divorce.<br />Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...
13438284 13440844 when I knew I loved you,<br />I ran home to tell you.
13440920 13442820 Oh, darling, darling...
13442989 13444581 Please don't go on with this.
13444657 13448286 Leave us some dignity to remember<br />out of our marriage. Spare us this last.
13448361 13449487 This last?
13449862 13451557 Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.
13451631 13455499 I must have loved you for years, only I was<br />such a stupid fool I didn't know it.
13455568 13457900 Please believe me. You must care.
13458437 13460132 Melly said you did.
13460339 13462864 I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?
13464010 13466171 I never really loved Ashley.
13466812 13470407 You certainly gave a good imitation of it,<br />up till this morning.
13471350 13473580 No, Scarlett. I tried everything.
13473953 13476979 If you'd only met me halfway,<br />even when I came back from London.
13477056 13480719 I was so glad to see you.<br />I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
13480826 13484057 And then, when you were sick<br />and it was all my fault...
13484130 13486963 I hoped against hope<br />that you'd call for me, but you didn't.
13487033 13491333 I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,<br />but I didn't think you wanted me.
13492838 13496865 It seems we've been at cross-purposes,<br />doesn't it? But it's no use now.
13497877 13501506 As long as there was Bonnie,<br />there was a chance we might be happy.
13501581 13503310 I liked to think that Bonnie was you.
13503382 13507182 A little girl again, before the war<br />and poverty had done things to you.
13507887 13512415 She was so like you, and I could pet her<br />and spoil her as I wanted to spoil you.
13514460 13516826 But when she went, she took everything.
13516896 13518056 Oh, Rhett!
13518531 13520362 Rhett, please don't say that.
13520433 13523596 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.
13525371 13527771 My darling, you're such a child.
13527940 13531967 You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"<br />all the past can be corrected.
13534647 13536945 Here, take my handkerchief.
13537216 13541209 Never at any crisis of your life<br />have I known you to have a handkerchief.
13545591 13548219 Rhett, where are you going?
13548294 13550626 I'm going to Charleston.<br />Back where I belong.
13550696 13553062 Please. Please take me with you.
13553699 13556224 No. I'm through with everything here.
13557036 13558560 I want peace.
13558704 13563038 I want to see if somewhere there isn't<br />something left in life of charm and grace.
13563776 13567940 - Do you know what I'm talking about?<br />- No. I only know that I love you.
13568014 13569641 That's your misfortune.
13569715 13570977 Oh, Rhett.
13576222 13577314 Rhett!
13583596 13584688 Rhett!
13584797 13587766 If you go, where shall I go?<br />What shall I do?
13589035 13591697 Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
13605251 13607685 Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!
13608554 13611148 There must be some way<br />to bring him back.
13613893 13617090 I can't think about this now.<br />I'll go crazy if I do!
13618864 13621059 I'll think about it tomorrow.
13635348 13637407 But I must think about it.
13638217 13639980 I must think about it.
13641053 13642714 What is there to do?
13643889 13645914 What is there that matters?
13649095 13651290 <i>Do you mean to tell me,<br />Katie Scarlett O'Hara...</i>
13651364 13655460 <i>that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?<br />Why, land's the only thing that matters.</i>
13655835 13657928 <i>It's the only thing that lasts.</i>
13658170 13661833 <i>Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.</i>
13662041 13665670 <i>It's this from which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.</i>

13677556 13678989 <i>Something you love better than me.</i>
13679058 13680286 <i>The red earth of Tara.</i>
13680359 13681986 <i>- Tara!<br />- Tara!</i>
13685598 13686758 Tara!
13687900 13689060 Home!
13690269 13691793 I'll go home!
13692805 13695433 And I'll think of some way to get him back.
13696075 13697440 After all...
13698010 13700604 tomorrow is another day.
