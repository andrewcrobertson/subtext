76705 78790 My back's near broken.
81418 83128 Look at my hands.
83837 87007 Mother said you could always tell a lady<br />by her hands.
87466 91428 I guess things like hands and ladies<br />don't matter so much anymore.
92304 96099 You rest, Sue, you're not well yet,<br />and I can pick cotton for both of us.
96308 99895 Scarlett's hateful, making us work<br />in the fields like...
99978 101730 Too bad about that.
102188 105066 Now get back to work.<br />I can't do everything at Tara all by myself.
105150 107736 What do I care about Tara? I hate Tara!
111156 114117 Don't you ever dare say<br />you hate Tara again!
114993 117328 The same as hating Pa and Ma.
124669 127297 Katie Scarlett, there's something<br />I must speak to you about.
127380 128339 Yes, Pa, what is it?
128423 132051 I've been talking to Prissy and Mammy.<br />I don't like the way you're treating them.
132135 135513 You must be firm with inferiors<br />but you must be gentle with them...
135680 137140 ...especially darkies.
137181 141060 Yes, Pa, I know. But I'm not asking them<br />to do anything I'm not doing myself.
141144 145481 Nevertheless, Katie Scarlett, I don't like it.<br />I shall speak to Mrs. O'Hara about it.
160705 162206 What are you doing out of bed, Melly?
162290 165501 Scarlett, darling, I must talk to you.<br />You are all working so hard.
165543 167253 I can't lie in bed doing nothing.
167336 169839 Go on back upstairs.<br />You're as weak as a newborn colt.
169922 171174 Please, Scarlett, let me.
171257 173384 Stop being noble.<br />I've got enough on my hands...
173467 176345 ...without you making yourself sick<br />so you'll never be any use.
176596 179140 Oh, I didn't think of it that way.
234820 237406 Who's there? Halt or I'll shoot!
243745 245664 You all alone, little lady?
248500 250878 You ain't very friendly, are you?
253880 256675 You got anything else<br />besides these earbobs?
256758 259261 You Yankees have been here before.
259469 262097 Regular little spitfire, ain't you?
263140 265600 What have you got hidden in your hand?
301094 303054 Scarlett, you killed him!
304222 306099 I'm glad you killed him!
307267 310687 Scarlett! Scarlett, what happened?<br />What is it, Scarlett? What is it?
315066 318194 Don't be scared, chickens.<br />Your sister was cleaning a revolver and...
318278 320738 ...it went off and nearly scared her<br />to death.
321030 324158 Oh, thank goodness.<br />Haven't we got enough to frighten us?
324325 326869 Tell Katie Scarlett<br />she must be more careful.
330081 332375 What a cool liar you are, Melly.
333042 335294 We've got to get him out of here<br />and bury him.
335378 337005 If the Yankees find him here, they'll...
337088 340550 I didn't see anyone else.<br />I think he must be a deserter.
340591 342218 But, even so, we've got to hide him.
342301 346055 They might hear about it,<br />and then they'd come and get you.
348975 351602 I could bury him in the arbor<br />where the ground is soft...
351686 354147 ...but how will I get him out of here?
354856 356399 We'll both take a leg and drag him.
356482 358234 You couldn't drag a cat.
365074 368411 Do you think it would be dishonest<br />if we went through his haversack?
368452 370621 I'm ashamed I didn't think of that myself.
370997 373833 You take the haversack,<br />I'll search his pockets.
386053 387096 You look.
387721 389265 I'm feeling a little weak.
389557 392143 Melly, I think it's full of money!
392977 394562 Oh, Melly, look!
394645 395688 Look!
396397 397481 Ten, $20, $30, $40...
397565 399733 Don't stop to count it now.<br />We haven't got time.
399984 402194 Do you realize this means<br />we'll have something to eat?
402278 404113 Look in his other pockets.
406198 407658 Hurry, hurry!
407825 410202 - We've got to get him out of here.<br />- Here.
423507 425801 If he bleeds across the yard,<br />we can't hide it.
426468 429429 Give me your nightgown, Melly.<br />I'll wad it around his head.
429513 431098 Don't be silly. I won't look at you.
431181 433809 If I had a petticoat or pantalettes,<br />I'd use them.
448073 450367 Thank heavens I'm not that modest.
451368 453829 Now go back to bed.<br />You'll be dead if you don't.
453995 456164 I'll clean up my mess when I've buried him.
456706 458875 No, I'll clean it up.
462254 464005 Well, I guess I've done murder.
466132 468134 I won't think about that now.
468635 470762 I'll think about that tomorrow.
479896 481064 Katie Scarlett!
482399 483566 Katie Scarlett!
484192 486027 It's over! It's over!
487070 488947 It's all over! The war!
489030 490407 Lee surrendered!
490615 492951 - It's not possible.<br />- Oh, why did we ever fight?
493284 495036 Ashley will be coming home.
495412 497163 Yes, Ashley'll be coming home.
497747 499374 We'll plant more cotton.
499415 501543 Cotton ought to go sky-high next year!
517100 520061 "While we were marching through Georgia.
520311 521980 "Hurrah, hurrah!
522063 523731 "We bring the jubilee.
523773 525358 "Hurrah, hurrah!
525441 527110 "The flag that makes you free.
527318 530363 "So we sing the chorus<br />from Atlanta to the sea.
530655 534158 "While we were marching<br />through Georgia."
534408 536577 Get out of the road, rebel!<br />Get out of the way!
536661 538830 Have you room in your carriage<br />for a dyin' man?
538913 541582 I got no room for any Southern scum,<br />alive or dead.
541666 542875 Get out of the way!
543125 545461 I reckon he'd rather try and walk it at that.
545753 548381 Giddap! Jump, you gray-backed beggars!
548506 550800 Act like they won the war!
551092 553803 Now you come on and give me them pants,<br />Mist' Kennedy.
553886 554929 Come on.
557223 560685 You scrub yourself with that strong<br />lye soap before I scrubs you myself.
560810 563896 I'm gonna put these britches<br />in the boilin' pot.
566607 569026 The whole Confederate Army's got<br />the same trouble...
569110 571153 ...crawlin' clothes and dysentery.
572071 573989 It's humiliating how you treat Mr. Kennedy.
574031 577618 You'd be a sight more humiliated<br />if Mist' Kennedy's lice gets on you!
579912 581163 Come on, Beau.
581330 585084 We must leave this gentleman alone<br />because he's tired and he's hungry.
586001 588712 I don't mind, ma'am.<br />Good to see a youngster again.
588963 590214 Nice little fellow.
590422 594134 Another two years of war and we could<br />have had him with us in Cobb's Legion.
595010 596512 Were you in Cobb's Legion?
596595 597805 Yes, ma'am.
597971 601183 Why, then, you must know my husband,<br />Major Wilkes.
601266 602559 Oh, yes, ma'am.
602810 605062 He was captured at Spottsylvania, I think.
605354 606563 Captured!
607439 609358 Oh, thank heavens, then he isn't...
609775 611985 Oh, my poor Ashley! In a Yankee prison!
612528 613737 Melanie!
613904 616698 Yes, Scarlett, I'm coming.<br />Come along, Beau.
616949 618992 I'll watch out for him, ma'am.<br />We're good friends.
619076 620577 Oh, thank you.
625165 628418 I slave day and night so we can have<br />food to keep body and soul together.
628543 631088 And you give it all away<br />to these starving scarecrows.
631171 633006 I'd rather a plague of locusts around here.
633048 635050 Don't scold me, Scarlett, please.
635092 637677 I've just heard<br />that Ashley was taken prisoner.
637928 639513 - Ashley, a prisoner!<br />- Yes.
639721 643892 And maybe if he's alive and well<br />he's on some Northern road right now.
644351 647521 And maybe some Northern woman<br />is giving him a share of her dinner...
647562 650649 ...and helping my beloved<br />to come back home to me.
652567 653693 I hope so, Melly.
653818 654819 Miss Scarlett.
658698 661910 Miss Scarlett, I wanted to take up<br />something with your pa but...
662202 663245 ...he doesn't seem to...
663328 665830 Perhaps I can help you.<br />I'm head of the house now.
666039 667707 Well, I, I...
668249 670877 Miss Scarlett, I was aimin' to ask<br />for Suellen.
672003 674255 Do you mean to tell me<br />you haven't asked for her...
674297 676508 ...after all these years<br />she's been counting on you?
676591 680345 Well, I, the truth is,<br />I'm so much older than she is, and...
680470 682597 Well, now I haven't a cent to my name.
682764 683932 Who has nowadays?
684557 687477 Miss Scarlett, if true love carries<br />any weight with you...
687560 690188 ...you can be sure your sister<br />will be rich in that.
690522 693816 I'll go out somewhere and get myself<br />a little business if we're engaged.
693942 695526 As soon as I get on my feet again...
695610 697987 All right, Frank.<br />I'm sure I can speak for Pa.
698112 699364 You go ask her now.
700365 702700 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
705953 707955 Excuse me, excuse me.
710708 713461 Scarlett, what seems to be<br />the trouble with Mr. Kennedy?
713753 715671 More trouble than he guesses.
715755 717632 He has finally asked for Suellen's hand.
717715 719133 Oh, I'm so glad.
719383 723554 It's a pity he can't marry her now.<br />At least, there'd be one less mouth to feed.
727433 728935 Oh, another one.
729519 730853 I hope this one isn't hungry.
730937 732021 He'll be hungry.
732104 734732 I'll tell Prissy to get an extra plate...
746369 747453 Ashley!
749705 750998 Ashley!
752666 753793 Darling!
764053 766764 Miss Scarlett! Don't spoil it, Miss Scarlett.
766847 769600 Turn me loose, you fool!<br />Turn me loose, it's Ashley!
769808 771769 He's her husband, ain't he?
784365 786408 - Miss Scarlett, ma'am.<br />- High time you got back.
786492 789244 - Did you get the horse shod?<br />- Yes, sir. He shod all right.
789495 793082 Fine thing when a horse can get shoes<br />and humans can't. Here, stir this soap.
793165 795125 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, ma'am.
795334 798712 I gotta know how much money<br />have you got left, in gold.
798962 800672 Ten dollars. Why?
801757 802966 That won't be enough.
803175 805219 What in heaven's name are you<br />talking about?
805302 809556 Well, Miss Scarlett, I see'd that old,<br />no-count white-trash Wilkerson...
809598 812184 ...that used to be<br />Mr. Gerald's overseer here.
812392 815771 He's a regular Yankee now,<br />and he was makin' a brag...
816063 820984 ...that his carpetbagger friends done run<br />the taxes way up sky-high on Tara.
821401 822861 But how much more have we got to pay?
822944 826114 I hear'd the tax man say $300.
826198 827532 Three hundred!
829117 830911 Might just as well be $3 million.
831369 833079 But we gotta raise it, that's all.
833163 834247 Yes, ma'am.
834456 835415 How?
837792 839044 I'll go ask Mr. Ashley.
839127 841421 Oh, he ain't got no $300, Miss Scarlett.
841504 843924 Well, I can ask him if I want to, can't I?
846509 847886 Askin' ain't gettin'.
857354 858563 Ashley!
859898 862442 They say Abe Lincoln got his start<br />splitting rails.
863359 865695 Just think what I may do<br />once I get the knack.
867238 869699 The Yankees want $300 more in taxes.
871493 873119 What shall we do?
873828 875622 Ashley, what's to become of us?
876414 879083 What becomes of people<br />when their civilization breaks up?
880084 883046 Those who have brains and courage<br />come through all right.
883171 884672 Those that haven't are winnowed out.
884756 888051 For heaven's sake, Ashley,<br />don't stand there talking nonsense at me...
888134 889969 ...when it's us who are being<br />winnowed out.
890053 891471 You're right, Scarlett.
891846 894474 Here I am talking tommy-rot<br />about civilization...
895016 896768 ...when your Tara's in danger.
897310 900146 You've come to me for help,<br />and I've no help to give you.
900730 902023 Oh, Scarlett, I...
902482 903775 ...l'm a coward.
904734 906319 You, Ashley, a coward?
907361 908905 What are you afraid of?
909238 912742 Oh, mostly of life becoming<br />too real for me, I suppose.
913910 916287 Not that I mind splitting rails...
916704 921083 ...but I do mind very much losing<br />the beauty of that life I loved.
923210 927715 If the war hadn't come, I'd have spent<br />my life happily buried at Twelve Oaks.
928341 930217 But the war did come.
930468 933012 I saw my boyhood friends blown to bits.
933220 935639 I saw men crumple up in agony<br />when I shot them.
936974 940311 And now I find myself in a world<br />which for me is worse than death.
941812 943981 A world in which there's no place for me.
946275 950029 I can never make you understand because<br />you don't know the meaning of fear.
950237 952364 You never mind facing realities...
953490 956368 ...and you never want to escape<br />from them as I do.
958996 960039 Escape?
961540 963292 Oh, Ashley, you're wrong.
963709 965336 I do want to escape too.
965961 970049 I'm so very tired of it all.<br />I've struggled for food and for money.
970132 974178 I've weeded and hoed and picked cotton<br />until I can't stand it another minute.
974595 977097 I tell you, Ashley, the South is dead.<br />It's dead.
977181 980893 The Yankees and the carpetbaggers<br />have got it and there's nothing left for us.
983312 984605 Oh, Ashley...
985439 987065 ...let's run away.
987149 988483 We'd go to Mexico.
988567 991612 They want officers in the Mexican Army.<br />We could be so happy there.
991695 995490 I'd work for you, I'd do anything for you.<br />You know you don't love Melanie.
995574 997618 You told me you loved me<br />that day at Twelve Oaks.
997701 999620 And anyway, Melanie can't...
1000329 1003790 Dr. Meade told me she couldn't have<br />any more children and I could give you...
1003832 1005834 Can't we ever forget<br />that day at Twelve Oaks?
1005917 1008420 Do you think I could ever forget it?<br />Have you forgotten it?
1008503 1010839 Can you honestly say you don't love me?
1012257 1014634 - No. I don't love you.<br />- It's a lie!
1014801 1018847 Even if it is, do you think I'd leave Melanie<br />and the baby, break Melanie's heart?
1018930 1020932 You couldn't leave<br />your father and the girls.
1020974 1023435 I could leave them. I'm sick of them.<br />I'm tired of them.
1023477 1026688 Yes, you're sick and tired.<br />That's why you're talking this way.
1028356 1030525 You've carried the load for all of us...
1030650 1033778 ...but from now on I'm going to be<br />more help to you, I promise.
1033987 1036114 There's only one way you can help me.
1036156 1037449 Take me away.
1037824 1039701 There's nothing to keep us here.
1041119 1042120 Nothing.
1044164 1045540 Nothing except honor.
1058511 1059971 Oh, please, Scarlett.
1060305 1062348 Please, dear, you mustn't cry.
1062724 1063766 You mustn't.
1063850 1066185 Please, my brave dear, you mustn't plead.
1079657 1081701 You do love me, you do love me.
1081993 1084037 - Say it, say it.<br />- Don't, don't.
1084328 1085705 You love me, you love me.
1085788 1088374 We won't do this, I tell you.<br />It won't happen again.
1088541 1090501 I'm going to take Melanie<br />and the baby, and go.
1090543 1091919 Say it, you love me.
1092003 1095506 All right, I'll say it.<br />I love your courage and your stubbornness.
1095715 1099468 So much that I could have forgotten<br />the best wife a man ever had.
1099552 1102013 But, Scarlett, I'm not going to forget her.
1111647 1113649 Then there's nothing left for me.
1115067 1117153 Nothing to fight for.
1117987 1119905 Nothing to live for.
1122616 1124034 Yes, there is something.
1125536 1127580 Something you love better than me...
1128330 1130082 ...though you may not know it.
1136172 1137089 Tara!
1141093 1142636 Yes, I...
1144430 1145931 ...I still have this.
1151103 1152354 You needn't go.
1153314 1156775 I won't have you all starve simply<br />because I threw myself at your head.
1158235 1159695 It won't happen again.
1188015 1190100 - Why, it's Emmy Slattery.<br />- Yes, ma'am, it's me.
1190183 1191143 Stop!
1191893 1194813 You haven't forgotten your old overseer,<br />have you?
1195647 1197441 Well, Emmy's Mrs. Wilkerson now.
1197607 1200444 Get off those steps, you trashy wench!<br />Get off this land!
1200944 1202446 You can't speak that way to my wife.
1202529 1204656 Wife! High time you made her your wife.
1205198 1207868 Who baptized your other brats<br />after you killed my mother?
1207951 1212831 We came out here to pay a friendly call<br />and talk a little business with old friends.
1212914 1215500 Friends! When were we ever friends<br />with the likes of you?
1215584 1218545 Still high and mighty, ain't you?<br />Well, I know all about you.
1218878 1220589 I know your father's turned idiot.
1220672 1222132 You can't pay your taxes.
1222424 1224801 And I come here<br />to offer to buy the place from you...
1224884 1226761 ...to make you a right good offer.
1226886 1228263 Emmy's had a hankerin' to live here.
1228346 1230432 Get off this place, you dirty Yankee.
1230640 1233518 You high-flyin' Irish will find out<br />who's runnin' things around here...
1233560 1235270 ...when you get sold out for taxes.
1235353 1238273 I'll buy this place lock, stock and barrel<br />and I'll live in it.
1238356 1240358 But I'll wait for the sheriff's sale.
1240817 1242652 That's all of Tara you'll ever get!
1244529 1245947 You'll be sorry for that.
1255039 1255999 We'll be back!
1256416 1258668 I'll show you who the owner of Tara is.
1264424 1265591 Pa, come back!
1269095 1270179 Pa, come back!
1270430 1271389 Pa!
1273015 1274308 Yankee coward!
1282441 1283192 Pa!
1303963 1307091 Lordsy, Miss Scarlett.<br />That's Mr. Gerald's watch.
1307341 1310052 You take it. It's for you.<br />Pa'd want you to have it.
1310594 1313931 You ain't got no business partin'<br />from this watch now, Miss Scarlett.
1313973 1317143 You needs all your valuables<br />to sell for that tax money.
1317601 1319562 Do you think I'd sell Pa's watch?
1321272 1322273 And don't cry.
1323399 1325609 I can stand everybody's tears but yours.
1329947 1331615 Oh, Mammy, Mammy.
1337538 1341667 You been brave so long, Miss Scarlett,<br />you just gotta go on bein' brave.
1342167 1344086 Think about your pa like he used to be.
1344211 1346046 I can't think about Pa.
1346296 1348632 I can't think of anything but that $300.
1348715 1350634 Ain't no good thinkin' about that,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1350676 1352469 Ain't nobody got that much money.
1353512 1356557 Nobody but Yankees and scalawags got<br />that much money now.
1359226 1360310 Rhett!
1360352 1361979 Who that? A Yankee?
1367276 1370195 Oh, Mammy, I'm so thin and pale and...
1371029 1372698 ...I haven't any clothes.
1382874 1385669 Scoot up to the attic and get down<br />Ma's old box of dress patterns.
1385710 1387504 What you up to with Miss Ellen's portieres?
1387546 1388672 You'll make me a new dress.
1388755 1391299 Not with Miss Ellen's portieres.<br />Not while I got breath in me.
1391383 1393844 Great balls of fire!<br />They're my portieres now.
1394344 1397889 I'm going to Atlanta for that $300<br />and I've got to go looking like a queen.
1398014 1400183 - Who goin' to Atlanta with you?<br />- I'm going alone.
1400225 1402561 That's what you think.<br />I's goin' to Atlanta with you.
1402602 1404104 With you and that new dress.
1404354 1405397 Now, Mammy, darling.
1405480 1407440 No use to try to sweet-talk me,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1407524 1410193 I's knowed you since I put<br />the first pair of diapers on you.
1410235 1413071 I said I's goin' to Atlanta with you,<br />and goin' I is.
1413530 1416700 Kings and traes, huh?<br />Too good for me, Major!
1417492 1419911 Pity we couldn't have fought the war out<br />in a poker game.
1419994 1423039 You'd have done better than General Grant<br />with far less effort.
1423206 1424207 What is it, Corporal?
1424290 1427544 Sir, there's a lady to see Captain Butler.<br />Says she's his sister.
1428086 1429212 Another sister?
1429963 1432340 This is a jail, not a harem, Captain Butler.
1432423 1434259 No, Major, she ain't one of those.
1434300 1436261 This one's got her mammy with her.
1437011 1438179 She has?
1439264 1441808 I'd like to see this one, Major,<br />without her mammy.
1444060 1446813 Let's see, my losses for the afternoon<br />come to what?
1449315 1450900 Three hundred and forty.
1450984 1453069 My debts do mount up, don't they, Major?
1453945 1455154 All right, Corporal.
1455238 1458116 Show Captain Butler's sister to his cell.
1458950 1461452 Thank you, Major. Excuse me, gentlemen.
1466290 1469877 It's hard to be strict with a man<br />who loses money so pleasantly.
1471963 1474382 - Rhett!<br />- Scarlett!
1474715 1476801 My dear little sister.
1478386 1481889 It's all right, Corporal.<br />My sister has brought me no files or saws.
1487895 1489105 Can I really kiss you now?
1489146 1491065 On the forehead like a good brother.
1491357 1494068 No, thanks.<br />I'll wait and hope for better things.
1494860 1497863 Oh, Rhett, I was so distressed<br />when I heard you were in jail.
1497988 1500032 I simply couldn't sleep for thinking.
1500449 1502159 It's not true, they're going to hang you?
1502201 1503369 Would you be sorry?
1503494 1505579 - Oh, Rhett!<br />- Well, don't worry, yet.
1505996 1507414 They have plotted<br />some charge against me...
1507498 1509124 ...but they're really after my money.
1509166 1511502 They think I made off<br />with the Confederate Treasury.
1511585 1512670 Well, did you?
1513254 1514713 What a leading question.
1514880 1517383 But let's not talk<br />about sordid things like money.
1517466 1520469 How good of you to come and see me.<br />And how pretty you look.
1520761 1523806 Oh, Rhett, how you do run on,<br />teasing a country girl like me.
1523889 1527059 Thank heavens you're not in rags.<br />I'm tired of seeing women in rags.
1527142 1528143 Turn around.
1528811 1531688 Marvelous! You look good enough to eat.<br />And prosperous, too.
1531772 1533607 Thank you, I've been doing very well.
1533690 1535484 Everybody's doing well at Tara, only...
1535567 1538862 ...I got so bored I just thought<br />I'd treat myself to a visit to town.
1539363 1541907 You're a heartless creature.<br />But that's part of your charm.
1541990 1544243 You know you've got more charm<br />than the law allows.
1544326 1546870 Now I didn't come here<br />to talk silliness about me, Rhett.
1546954 1550040 I came because I was so miserable<br />at the thought of you in trouble.
1550123 1553001 I was mad at you the night you left me<br />on the road to Tara...
1553085 1554503 ...and I still haven't forgiven you.
1554586 1556213 Oh, Scarlett, don't say that.
1556338 1560050 Well, I must admit I might not be alive,<br />now, only for you.
1560425 1564137 And when I think of myself<br />with everything I could possibly hope for...
1564221 1568058 ...and not a care in the world,<br />and you here in this horrid jail...
1568600 1571561 ...and not even a human jail, Rhett,<br />a horse jail.
1572979 1575315 Oh, listen to me trying<br />to make jokes when...
1575607 1577192 ...when I really want to cry.
1577818 1579236 In a minute I shall cry.
1582906 1585742 Scarlett, can it be possible that...
1586451 1587994 Can what be possible, Rhett?
1588453 1591289 That you've grown a woman's heart,<br />a real woman's heart?
1592207 1594334 I have, Rhett. I know I have.
1597128 1600173 You know, it's worth being in jail<br />just to hear you say that.
1602258 1603551 It's well worth it.
1608473 1610975 You can drop the moonlight<br />and magnolias, Scarlett.
1611184 1613478 So things have been going well<br />at Tara, have they?
1613770 1615104 What have you done with your hands?
1615188 1617315 I went riding last week<br />without my gloves.
1617398 1620443 These don't belong to a lady.<br />You've worked with them like a field hand.
1620527 1622278 Why did you lie? What are you up to?
1622904 1625114 In another minute I'd have believed<br />you cared something.
1625198 1626282 But I do care.
1626366 1627784 Suppose we get down to the truth.
1627825 1631746 You want something from me badly enough<br />to put on quite a show in your velvets.
1632163 1633539 What is it? Money?
1634666 1636876 I want $300 to pay the taxes on Tara.
1637543 1640296 I did lie to you<br />when I said everything was all right.
1640338 1644342 Things are just as bad as they possibly<br />could be. And you've got millions, Rhett.
1645510 1647345 What collateral are you offering?
1647470 1648971 - My earbobs.<br />- Not interested.
1649055 1651057 - A mortgage on Tara.<br />- What would I do with a farm?
1651140 1653643 You wouldn't lose.<br />I'd pay you back out of next year's cotton.
1653726 1655811 Not good enough.<br />Have you nothing better?
1658689 1660233 You once said you loved me.
1661192 1662860 If you still love me, Rhett...
1663486 1665655 You haven't forgotten<br />that I'm not a marrying man.
1666739 1668866 No, I haven't forgotten.
1674705 1676374 You're not worth $300.
1677208 1679627 You'll never mean anything<br />but misery to any man.
1680211 1681170 Go on, insult me.
1681253 1683380 I don't care what you say,<br />only give me the money.
1683464 1687218 I won't let Tara go. I can't let it go<br />while there's a breath left in my body.
1687510 1688552 Oh, Rhett.
1688886 1691013 Won't you please give me the money?
1691388 1693516 I couldn't give you the money<br />if I wanted to.
1693599 1695684 My funds are in Liverpool, not in Atlanta.
1695768 1699355 If I tried drawing a draft, the Yankees'd be<br />on me like a duck on a June bug.
1699772 1702650 So you see, my dear,<br />you've abased yourself to no purpose.
1705986 1707780 Here, here, here, stop it!
1708739 1710699 Want the Yankees to see you like this?
1710741 1712576 Take your hands off me, you skunk.
1712785 1714953 You knew what I was going to say<br />before I started.
1715037 1718290 You knew you wouldn't lend me the money<br />and yet you let me go on.
1718373 1720042 I enjoyed hearing what you had to say.
1720250 1723629 Cheer up. You can come to my hanging<br />and I'll remember you in my will.
1723712 1726590 I'll come to your hanging.<br />The only thing I'm afraid of...
1726632 1729718 ...is that they won't hang you in time<br />to pay the taxes on Tara.
1736350 1737684 Tell him Belle Watlin'.
1738101 1740938 Where you been lately?<br />Thought you deserted Captain Butler.
1740979 1743106 Oh, I keep myself occupied. Help me out.
1752741 1756161 Who that? I ain't never see'd hair<br />that color before in my life.
1756828 1758497 Does you know a dyed-hair woman?
1758580 1761249 I wish I did know that one.<br />She'd get my money for me.
1763835 1765837 No matter what they done to you<br />in that jail...
1765921 1767589 ...they didn't do no more<br />than you deserve...
1767672 1769758 ...for visitin' white trash in a jail!
1776806 1777849 Fresh and green.
1777933 1779100 Right off the farm.
1779142 1781186 Hey, what are you doin' tonight, Susy?
1781436 1782812 That's one of them Georgia peaches.
1782896 1784814 There's nothing like that in Ohio.
1785148 1787400 - You know what we're going to do?<br />- What?
1787817 1790820 We're going to give every last one of you<br />40 acres and a mule!
1790904 1793323 - And a mule?<br />- Forty acres and a mule!
1793615 1794574 Gee!
1794657 1796284 'Cause we're your friends...
1796493 1798328 ...and you're gonna become voters...
1798453 1800830 ...and you're gonna vote<br />like your friends do!
1802665 1803958 What's your hurry, sister?
1804000 1805418 What's come over this here town?
1805502 1808630 Yankees have come over it!<br />Same as they've come over all of us.
1811174 1812759 Out of our way, trash!
1813384 1814469 Get out of the way here.
1814552 1815720 Get away! Go on!
1824312 1825980 Surely it can't be Miss Scarlett!
1826022 1827940 - Why Frank Kennedy!<br />- And Mammy!
1828024 1829859 It sure is good to see home folks.
1830026 1831569 I didn't know you were in Atlanta.
1831652 1833070 I didn't know you were.
1833154 1835323 Didn't Miss Suellen tell you<br />about my store?
1835698 1837992 Did she? I don't remember.<br />Have you a store?
1839744 1842038 Won't you come in, and look around a bit?
1850588 1853174 I don't suppose it looks like much<br />to a lady, but...
1853257 1855092 ...I can't help being proud of it.
1855760 1857053 You're not making money?
1857136 1860348 Well, I can't complain.<br />In fact, I'm mighty encouraged.
1860848 1862892 Folks tell me I'm just a born merchant.
1863476 1866312 It won't be long now<br />before Miss Suellen and I can marry.
1866687 1868230 Are you doing as well as all that?
1868314 1869940 Yes, I am, Miss Scarlett.
1870191 1872026 I'm no millionaire yet...
1872109 1874445 ...but I've cleared $1,000 already.
1874778 1875863 And lumber too.
1875946 1877031 Well...
1877740 1879033 ...that's only a sideline.
1879074 1880576 A sideline, Frank?
1880743 1884663 With all the good Georgia pine around<br />Atlanta and all this building going on?
1884747 1887207 Well, all that takes money, Miss Scarlett...
1888250 1890336 ...and I've got to be thinking<br />about buying a home.
1890419 1891962 What do you want a home for?
1892046 1894131 For Miss Suellen and me<br />to set up housekeeping.
1894757 1898093 Here in Atlanta. You'd want to bring her<br />to Atlanta, wouldn't you?
1898969 1900971 There wouldn't be much help<br />in that for Tara.
1902306 1904892 I don't rightly know what you mean,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1905309 1906560 I don't mean a thing.
1906643 1909813 Frank, how'd you like to drive me out<br />to my Aunt Pitty's?
1910773 1913066 Nothing would give me<br />more pleasure, Miss Scarlett.
1913150 1914860 You'd better stay to supper, too.
1914943 1918280 I'm sure Aunt Pitty'd be agreeable<br />and I'd like a good long visit with you.
1918405 1921033 Oh, you act on me just like a tonic,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1922284 1924244 And will you tell me all the news...
1924578 1926371 ...all the news of Miss Suellen?
1929166 1930751 What's the matter, Miss Scarlett?
1931084 1932586 Miss Suellen's not ill, is she?
1932669 1933837 Oh, no, no.
1934379 1936340 I thought surely she had written you.
1936423 1938091 I guess she was ashamed to write you.
1938175 1939760 She should be ashamed.
1939843 1942387 Oh, how awful to have such a mean sister.
1942512 1945682 You must tell me, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't leave me on tenterhooks.
1946683 1949728 Well, she's going to marry<br />one of the county boys next month.
1951271 1954733 She just got tired of waiting<br />and was afraid she'd be an old maid and...
1954983 1957194 Oh, I'm sorry to be the one to tell you.
1958361 1961072 Oh, it's colder. I left my muff at home.
1961323 1964200 Would you mind<br />if I put my hand in your pocket?
1980550 1983052 But, Melanie, you don't realize<br />what she's done.
1983720 1985680 She's gone and married my Mr. Kennedy.
1986181 1988308 He's my beau,<br />and she's gone and married him.
1988391 1990602 She did it to save Tara,<br />you must understand that.
1990685 1991936 I hate Tara!
1992020 1995273 And I hate Scarlett! She's the only thing<br />I hate worse than Tara.
1999903 2001112 It's all my fault.
2002447 2005742 I should have committed highway robbery<br />to get that tax money for you.
2005825 2008202 I couldn't let you do<br />anything like that, and...
2008453 2009954 Well, anyway, it's done now.
2010038 2011414 Yes, it's done now.
2012498 2014208 You wouldn't let me<br />do anything dishonorable...
2014250 2016919 ...but you'd sell yourself in marriage<br />to a man you didn't love.
2018087 2021382 Well, at least you won't have to worry<br />about my helplessness anymore.
2022592 2023759 What do you mean?
2024177 2025595 I'm going to New York.
2027263 2029223 I've arranged to get a position<br />in a bank there.
2029265 2030600 But you can't do that.
2032727 2035897 I counted on you to help me start<br />a lumber business, Ashley...
2035980 2038024 ...and, well, I counted on you.
2038190 2039525 I wouldn't be any good to you.
2039609 2041235 I don't know anything<br />about the lumber business.
2041319 2042862 You know as much as you do<br />about banking.
2043988 2046073 And I'd give you half the business, Ashley.
2046949 2048743 That's generous of you, Scarlett.
2049952 2051203 But it isn't that.
2051662 2053831 If I go to Atlanta<br />and take help from you again...
2054874 2057293 ...l'd bury forever any hope<br />of standing alone.
2057460 2058544 Oh, is that all?
2059003 2063090 Well, you could gradually buy the business<br />and then it would be your own, and...
2064425 2065718 No, Scarlett.
2069305 2070347 Ashley...
2078355 2079315 Ashley.
2087031 2088115 Scarlett!
2089950 2091201 Scarlett, what is it?
2091368 2092953 Ashley's so mean and hateful.
2093996 2095164 What have you done?
2097749 2099459 She wanted me to go to Atlanta.
2099543 2103755 To help me start my lumber business, and<br />he won't lift a finger to help me, and he...
2103839 2105507 Why, how unchivalrous of you.
2105841 2107467 Why, think, Ashley, think.
2108010 2110846 If it hadn't been for Scarlett,<br />I'd have died in Atlanta.
2111305 2114099 And maybe we wouldn't have had<br />little Beau, and...
2114182 2117519 ...and when I think of her picking cotton<br />and plowing just to keep food...
2117602 2118895 ...in our mouths, I could just...
2119479 2120605 Oh, my darling.
2125569 2126820 All right, Melanie.
2127446 2128655 I'll go to Atlanta.
2130532 2131867 I can't fight you both.
2151720 2154347 Well, here's your new mill hands,<br />Mrs. Kennedy.
2154806 2157017 The pick of all the best jails in Georgia.
2158184 2160353 They look pretty thin and weak to me,<br />Gallegher.
2160395 2161062 Halt!
2164065 2165525 They're the best you can lease, ma'am.
2165608 2168319 And if you'll just give Johnny Gallegher<br />a free hand...
2168528 2170655 ...you'll get what you want out of them.
2170905 2172657 All right, you're the foreman.
2173199 2176703 All I ask is, you keep the mill running<br />and deliver my lumber when I want it.
2176744 2178329 Johnny Gallegher's your man, Miss.
2178413 2179539 But remember...
2179747 2182333 ...no questions and no interference.
2182750 2185378 That's a bargain.<br />Start them in the morning, Gallegher.
2185461 2187422 Come on, get a move on!<br />Come on, move on there!
2187463 2189841 But, Scarlett, this isn't right<br />and you know it.
2190341 2192593 It's bad enough for a woman<br />to be in business, but...
2192677 2193928 What are you complaining about?
2193970 2196347 You wouldn't have owned a mill<br />had I not taken over.
2196431 2199016 I didn't want the mill,<br />and we couldn't have bought it...
2199100 2202395 ...if you hadn't pressed all of our friends<br />for the money they owed me.
2202437 2203438 Isn't that right, Ashley?
2203521 2205773 What are you running,<br />a charitable institution?
2205815 2208317 Go back to the store,<br />then go home and take your medicine.
2208401 2209443 You're not looking very well.
2209527 2211737 But, sugar, shouldn't you come home<br />with me?
2211779 2215157 Great balls of fire. Don't bother me<br />anymore, and don't call me sugar!
2215241 2217076 All right, all right.
2217618 2219078 Good night, Ashley.
2221163 2223708 She can get mad quicker<br />than any woman I ever saw.
2225501 2227628 Scarlett, I don't like to interfere, but...
2227712 2231173 ...I do wish you'd let me hire free darkies<br />instead of using convicts.
2231257 2232508 I believe we could do better.
2232591 2235678 Darkies! Why, their pay would break us,<br />and convicts are dirt cheap.
2235761 2237388 If we just give Gallegher a free hand...
2237471 2240891 A free hand! You know what that means.<br />He'll starve them and whip them.
2240975 2242935 Some of them are sick, underfed...
2242977 2244645 Oh, Ashley, how you do run on.
2244812 2247606 Left alone, you'd be giving them chicken<br />three times a day and...
2247648 2249775 ...tucking them to sleep<br />with eiderdown quilts.
2249859 2253821 Scarlett, I will not make money out<br />of the enforced labor and misery of others.
2253946 2255656 You weren't so particular<br />about owning slaves.
2255739 2258325 That was different.<br />We didn't treat them that way.
2258492 2260744 Besides, I'd have freed them all<br />when father died...
2260828 2262788 ...if the war hadn't already freed them.
2263122 2264415 Oh, I'm sorry, Ashley.
2264832 2267251 But have you forgotten<br />what it's like without money?
2267334 2270170 I found out that money is<br />the most important thing in the world...
2270254 2272673 ...and I don't intend ever to be<br />without it again.
2272756 2275676 I'll make enough so the Yankees can never<br />take Tara away from me.
2275759 2277136 I'll make it the only way I know how.
2277219 2279721 But we're not the only Southerners<br />who have suffered.
2279805 2283559 Look at all our friends. They're keeping<br />their honor and their kindness, too.
2283642 2287312 And they're starving. I've got no use<br />for fools who won't help themselves.
2287396 2289815 I know what they're saying about me,<br />and I don't care.
2289898 2291650 I'll make friends<br />with the Yankee carpetbaggers.
2291733 2294903 And I'll beat them at their own game,<br />and you'll beat them with me.
2297614 2300033 That's it. Move it a little over to that side.
2300993 2302411 Afternoon, Mrs. Kennedy.
2302619 2303578 Good afternoon.
2303662 2305288 Business is certainly growing, ain't it?
2305372 2306415 It certainly is.
2308041 2311002 But you're doing business<br />with the same people who robbed us...
2311086 2313588 ...and tortured us and left us to starve.
2313713 2314881 All that's past, Melly.
2314965 2318468 And I intend to make the best of things,<br />even if they are Yankee things.
2321138 2324516 And do you know, Dolly Merriwether,<br />that Dr. Meade actually saw her...
2324599 2326810 ...peddling lumber<br />to those Yankees, herself.
2327018 2328061 And that isn't all...
2328144 2331022 I think it's shocking what she's doing<br />to my brother, Ashley.
2331064 2333608 She's even taken to driving her own buggy.
2341408 2343118 My dear Mrs. Kennedy.
2343201 2344911 My very dear Mrs. Kennedy.
2345495 2347497 I don't see how you have<br />the gall to face me.
2347580 2349207 When I think you could have had<br />my millions...
2349290 2350917 ...if you'd just waited a little while.
2351000 2352669 Oh, how fickle is woman!
2353128 2355547 What is it you want?<br />I have important things to do.
2355588 2359801 Would you satisfy my curiosity on a point<br />which has bothered me for some time?
2359884 2361094 Well, what is it? Be quick.
2361553 2364973 Tell me, Scarlett, do you never shrink<br />from marrying men you don't love?
2365932 2368851 How did you ever get out of jail?<br />Why didn't they hang you?
2369769 2371229 Oh, that! Not much trouble.
2371312 2373064 There's nothing much<br />that money won't buy.
2373147 2375942 I observe it's even bought you<br />the honorable Mr. Wilkes.
2376734 2378528 So you still hate Ashley Wilkes.
2379070 2380905 Do you know,<br />I believe you're jealous of him.
2380988 2383783 You still think you're the belle<br />of the county, don't you?
2383866 2385910 That you're the cutest little trick<br />in shoe leather.
2385993 2388121 And that every man you meet<br />is dying of love for you.
2388204 2389247 Let me by!
2389997 2392667 Don't be angry, Scarlett.<br />Tell me, where are you going?
2393167 2395044 To the mill, if it's any of your business.
2395086 2396546 Through shantytown, alone?
2396587 2400049 Haven't you been told it's dangerous<br />to drive alone through all that riffraff?
2400132 2401467 Don't worry about me.
2401759 2404428 I can shoot straight<br />if I don't have to shoot too far.
2412103 2413104 What a woman!
2448514 2450099 Could ya gimme a quarter?
2450140 2451517 Let go of my horse!
2453852 2455020 Hold this horse!
2466031 2467074 Help!
2467616 2468992 Help!
2470619 2471703 Help!
2505946 2507239 Miss Scarlett!
2526299 2528802 Miss Scarlett, wait! Miss Scarlett!
2529260 2530762 Miss Scarlett! It's Big Sam!
2530845 2531846 Big Sam!
2532222 2533515 Miss Scarlett! Wait!
2536226 2537602 Sam! Sam!
2538103 2540605 Is you hurt, Miss Scarlett?<br />Did they hurt you?
2541981 2545693 Don't you cry, Miss Scarlett.<br />Big Sam'll get you out of this in a jiffy.
2546611 2547737 Horse, make tracks!
2551783 2554202 You get to Tara just as quick as you can,<br />and stay there.
2554285 2556746 I sure will.<br />I's got enough of them carpetbaggers.
2557038 2559207 Thank you, Mr. Frank.<br />Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.
2559290 2560917 Goodbye, Sam, and thank you.
2561125 2564420 Scarlett, change your dress and go over<br />to Miss Melly's for the evening.
2564462 2566339 I've got to go to a political meeting.
2566422 2567590 A political meeting!
2567674 2569258 How can you go to a political meeting...
2569300 2571010 ...after what I've been through<br />this afternoon?
2571094 2573554 Oh, sugar! You're more scared than hurt.
2574180 2578267 Nobody cares about me.<br />You all act as though it was nothing at all.
2600039 2602708 The men talk, talk, talk<br />about protecting our women...
2603000 2606837 ...and after what happened to me today<br />Frank has to go to a political meeting.
2611008 2613552 And if it won't pain you too much,<br />India Wilkes...
2613928 2616680 ...l'd be much obliged<br />if you'll tell me why you're staring at me.
2616764 2618224 Has my face gone green or something?
2618307 2619350 It won't pain me!
2619892 2622520 What happened this afternoon was<br />just what you deserved!
2622603 2624730 And if there was any justice,<br />you'd have gotten worse.
2624813 2625773 India, hush up!
2625856 2628108 Let her talk, Melanie.<br />She's always hated me!
2628192 2629693 Ever since I took your brother<br />away from her...
2629777 2631946 ...though she's too much of a hypocrite<br />to admit it!
2632029 2633405 If she thought anyone'd go for her...
2633489 2635032 ...she'd walk down the street naked!
2635115 2636659 I do hate you!
2637618 2640788 You've done all you could<br />to lower the prestige of decent people.
2641121 2643665 Now you've endangered the lives<br />of our men, because they...
2643707 2644708 India!
2644917 2648504 I don't think we'd better say any more,<br />or one of us will be saying too much.
2648796 2651465 What's going on around here<br />that I don't know about?
2657304 2658972 Somebody's comin' up the walk.
2659181 2660933 Somebody that ain't Mr. Ashley.
2661808 2664228 Will you hand me the pistol, please,<br />Mrs. Meade?
2670734 2671902 Whoever it is...
2673153 2674446 ...we know nothing.
2678200 2679326 Where have they gone?
2679409 2681578 You've got to tell me, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />It's life or death!
2681661 2683872 Don't tell him anything. He's a Yankee spy.
2683955 2686249 Quickly, please! There may still be time.
2686333 2687375 How did you know?
2687459 2689211 I've been playing poker<br />with two Yankee captains.
2689294 2690378 They knew there'd be trouble tonight.
2690462 2692214 They've sent their cavalry out<br />to be ready for it.
2692297 2694382 Your husband and his friends are<br />walking into a trap.
2694466 2696718 Don't tell him! He's trying to trap you!
2699888 2702766 Out the Decatur Road.<br />The old Sullivan plantation.
2703183 2704893 The house is burned.<br />They're meeting in the cellar.
2704935 2706269 I'll do what I can.
2711149 2714069 What's all this about?<br />If you don't tell me, I'll go crazy!
2714486 2715945 We thought it best not to tell you, Scarlett.
2716029 2718531 But Ashley and Frank and the others<br />have gone to clean out those woods...
2718615 2720075 ...where you were attacked.
2720283 2721910 It's what a great many<br />of our Southern gentlemen have had...
2721951 2723745 ...to do lately for our protection.
2723787 2726706 And if they're captured, they'll be hanged,<br />Scarlett!
2727123 2728500 And it will be your fault!
2728625 2730543 Another word,<br />and you go out of this house, India!
2730627 2732587 Scarlett did what she thought<br />she had to do.
2732670 2735465 And our men are doing<br />what they think they have to do.
2736216 2737300 Frank!
2738051 2739260 And Ashley!
2741638 2742931 Oh, it isn't possible!
2746809 2749270 There's horses, Miss Melly.<br />Here they come.
2749395 2750980 You're sewing, you're sewing.
2755902 2757195 Open the door, Mammy.
2767413 2769248 Good evening, Mrs. Kennedy.
2771667 2773252 Which of you ladies is Mrs. Wilkes?
2773336 2774420 I am Mrs. Wilkes.
2775254 2777673 I should like to speak to Mr. Wilkes,<br />if you please.
2777757 2778758 He's not here.
2779091 2780092 Are you sure?
2780176 2782053 Don't you doubt Miss Melly's word.
2782345 2784180 I meant no disrespect, Mrs. Wilkes.
2784889 2787516 If you'll give me your word,<br />I won't search the house.
2787600 2791479 Search if you like, but Mr. Wilkes is at<br />a political meeting at Mr. Kennedy's store.
2791520 2794148 He's not at the store,<br />and there's no meeting tonight!
2794482 2795816 No political meeting.
2796192 2798778 We'll wait outside<br />till he and his friends return.
2800321 2803240 Sergeant, surround the house.<br />Put a man on each door and window.
2803324 2804366 Yes, sir!
2808996 2810831 Keep on with your sewing, ladies.
2811707 2814043 And I'll read aloud.
2817546 2820633 "The Personal History and Experience<br />of David Copperfield.
2823719 2824845 "Chapter one.
2825262 2826388 "I'm born.
2830934 2834730 "To begin my life, with the beginning<br />of my life, I record that I was born.
2835647 2838192 "Chapter Nine.<br />I have a memorable birthday.
2838275 2840319 "I pass over all that happened at school...
2840402 2843572 "...until the anniversary of my birthday<br />came around in March.
2844781 2847367 "Except that Steerforth was more to be<br />admired than ever.
2847451 2848744 "I remember nothing.
2848785 2851872 "He was going away at the end<br />of the half year, if not sooner...
2851997 2855334 "...and was more spirited and independent<br />than before in my eyes...
2855751 2858211 "...and, therefore, more engaging<br />than before, but...
2858253 2860172 "...beyond this I remember nothing.
2861048 2862257 "The great..."
2864634 2865761 "I remember nothing."
2870807 2872517 Melly! They're drunk!
2873310 2874811 Leave this to me, Scarlett.
2875020 2876813 And, please, say nothing.
2880275 2881735 You stupid fool!
2883945 2885113 Quiet!
2885739 2887657 Will you shut up for the love of...?
2888199 2889200 Hello, Melly.
2889367 2892412 So, you've got my husband<br />intoxicated again, Captain Butler!
2892954 2893955 Well, bring him in.
2894039 2896416 I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilkes.<br />Your husband's under arrest.
2896458 2898543 If you arrest all the men<br />who get intoxicated...
2898626 2900462 ...you must have a good many Yankees<br />in jail.
2901463 2904132 Bring him in, Captain Butler.<br />If you can walk yourself.
2906217 2907552 I want to tell you a story...
2907635 2908970 Listen, Doctor, I...
2909345 2910597 Put him there in that chair.
2914684 2917061 And now, Captain Butler,<br />will you please leave my house...
2917145 2919731 ...and try to remember<br />not to come here again?
2920064 2922942 Well, now that's fine thanks I get<br />for bringing him home...
2923234 2925820 ...and not leaving him on the streets<br />in this shameful condition!
2925862 2927488 Now, boys, all together!
2927947 2929449 Dr. Meade...
2930074 2931951 ...l'm astonished at you!
2938708 2940960 Oh, Ashley! How can you do this to me?
2942795 2944547 I ain't so very drunk, Melly.
2945631 2948259 Take him into the bedroom<br />and lay him out on the bed as usual.
2948342 2949927 Don't touch him, he's under arrest!
2950011 2950970 Now, Tom.
2951095 2952889 What do you want to arrest him for?
2953222 2954891 I've seen him drunker.
2955141 2957727 I've seen you drunker!<br />And you've seen me...
2957810 2960730 He can lie in the gutter for all I care!<br />I'm not a policeman.
2961522 2963274 But he led a raid tonight<br />on that shantytown...
2963357 2966068 ...where Mrs. Kennedy got into trouble<br />this afternoon.
2966235 2969238 A lot of those shanties were burned.<br />A couple of men were killed.
2969322 2973200 It's about time you rebels learned you can't<br />take the law into your own hands.
2973451 2974994 What are you laughing at?
2976704 2979206 This isn't your night<br />to teach that lesson, Tom.
2979582 2982460 These two have been<br />with me tonight. Yes, sir.
2982752 2983961 With you, Rhett?
2985045 2986005 Where?
2990092 2992553 I don't like to say in the presence of ladies.
2993012 2994096 You'd better say.
2994763 2996891 Come out on the porch and I'll tell you.
2997016 2998142 Speak out, Captain Butler!
2998225 3000895 I think I have a right to know<br />where my husband's been.
3003105 3006400 Well, ma'am, we dropped in<br />on a friend of mine...
3007651 3008986 ...and the captain's.
3009486 3010863 A Mrs. Belle Watling.
3011864 3014950 We played cards, drank champagne and...
3015951 3017036 ...well...
3017119 3020539 Now, you've done it! Did you have to<br />show me up in front of my wife?
3022124 3024001 Now I hope you're satisfied, Tom.
3024168 3027504 These ladies won't be on speaking terms<br />with their husbands tomorrow.
3028964 3030966 Rhett, I had no idea, I...
3032301 3035846 Look here, will you take an oath<br />that they were with you tonight at...
3036305 3037431 ...at Belle's?
3037806 3040767 Ask Belle, if you don't believe me.<br />She'll tell you, Captain.
3040809 3042978 Will you give me your word<br />as a gentleman?
3043395 3044479 As a gentleman?
3044813 3046106 Why certainly, Tom.
3048817 3050110 Well, if I...
3050152 3052279 ...if I've made a mistake, I'm sorry.
3053405 3055782 I hope you'll forgive me, Mrs. Wilkes. I...
3057492 3059578 If you'll go and leave us in peace, please.
3059661 3062247 Well, I say I'm sorry, and...
3063373 3065000 ...well, I am sorry.
3065083 3066585 Come on, Sergeant.
3073049 3075093 Lock that door. Pull down the shades.
3077220 3078305 Ashley.
3078388 3080807 It's all right. It's only in the shoulder.
3081057 3083351 Get him on the bed<br />where I can dress the wound.
3083435 3084853 I think I can walk.
3085895 3087981 It's not worth the effort. Which way?
3088023 3089107 In here.
3090775 3092736 - Mammy, I want some hot water.<br />- Yes, sir.
3092819 3094279 - And lint for bandages.<br />- I'll find some.
3094362 3097323 Now what can I use for a probe?<br />If I only had my bag.
3097365 3100034 Were you really there?<br />What did it look like?
3100702 3104706 Does she have cut-glass chandeliers,<br />plush curtains and dozens of mirrors?
3104873 3107000 Good heavens, Mrs. Meade,<br />remember yourself.
3109711 3112922 And now, Captain Butler,<br />tell me what happened, all that happened.
3113464 3114841 I was too late.
3115466 3119012 When I got to the old Sullivan place there'd<br />already been a skirmish with the Yankees.
3119053 3121889 I found Mr. Wilkes wounded<br />and Dr. Meade was with him.
3122265 3125560 I had to prove they had been somewhere,<br />anyplace but where they were.
3126644 3128187 So I took them to Belle's.
3128396 3129605 And she took them in?
3130064 3132233 She's by way of being<br />an old friend of mine.
3132775 3134777 Oh, I'm sorry. L...
3134861 3137530 I'm sorry I couldn't think up<br />a more dignified alibi.
3141492 3145079 This isn't the first time you've come<br />between me and disaster, Captain Butler.
3145162 3147999 It isn't likely that I'd question<br />any device of yours.
3150209 3153462 And now, I'll go and see<br />what Dr. Meade needs.
3159176 3160553 Oh, Ashley!
3162346 3163431 Ashley!
3165474 3168978 Have you no interest in what's become<br />of your own husband, Mrs. Kennedy?
3171772 3174024 Did Frank go with you to Belle Watling's?
3174275 3175359 No.
3175943 3177069 Well, where is he?
3178028 3179822 He's lying out on Decatur Road...
3180906 3182324 ...shot through the head.
3183534 3184618 He's dead.
3194920 3195963 Who is it?
3196463 3197589 It's Miss Watlin'.
3197798 3200259 Oh, Mrs. Watling!<br />Won't you come in the house?
3200759 3202886 Oh, no, I couldn't do that, Miss Wilkes.
3203971 3205973 You come in and sit a minute with me.
3214356 3216483 How can I thank you enough<br />for what you did for us?
3216567 3218318 How can any of us thank you enough?
3218402 3221530 I got your note sayin' you was goin'<br />to call on me and thank me.
3221613 3224032 Why, Miss Wilkes,<br />you must have lost your mind.
3224866 3226952 I come up here as soon<br />as it was dark to tell you...
3227035 3229288 ...you mustn't even think of any such thing.
3229371 3230372 Why, I'm...
3231290 3232374 Why, you're...
3232916 3234626 Well, it wouldn't be fittin' at all.
3234668 3238714 It wouldn't be fitting to thank a kind<br />woman who saved my husband's life?
3238797 3243176 Miss Wilkes, there ain't never been a lady<br />in this town nice to me like you was.
3243927 3246471 I mean, about the money<br />for the hospital, you know.
3246805 3248390 And I don't forget a kindness.
3248807 3251935 And I got to thinking about you being left<br />a widow with a little boy...
3252018 3253687 ...if Mr. Wilkes got hung...
3254354 3257148 ...and he's a nice little boy,<br />your boy is, Miss Wilkes.
3257983 3260485 I got a boy myself and so I...
3261111 3263196 Oh, you have? Does he live...?
3263405 3265657 Oh, no, ma'am, he ain't here in Atlanta.
3266866 3268285 He ain't never been here.
3268827 3270745 He's off at school.
3271246 3273248 I ain't seen him since he was little.
3276251 3280255 Well, anyway, if it had been<br />that Miss Kennedy's husband by hisself...
3280588 3284008 ...I wouldn't have lifted a finger to,<br />no matter what Captain Butler said.
3284092 3286010 She's a mighty cold woman.
3286094 3288221 Prancin' about Atlanta by herself.
3288680 3291015 She killed her husband<br />same as if she shot him.
3291641 3294310 You mustn't say unkind things<br />about my sister-in-law.
3297939 3299941 Please don't freeze me, Miss Wilkes.
3300275 3301985 I forgot how you liked her.
3303236 3307240 But she just ain't in the same class<br />with you and I can't help it if I think so.
3308074 3310326 Well, anyway, I gotta be goin'.
3311369 3315123 I'm scared somebody'll recognize<br />this carriage if I stayed here any longer.
3315206 3316999 That wouldn't do you no good.
3317917 3319335 And Miss Wilkes...
3319877 3323089 ...if you ever see me on the street,<br />you don't have to speak to me.
3323881 3325174 I'll understand.
3326008 3329804 I should be proud to speak to you.<br />Proud to be under obligation to you.
3331138 3332515 I hope we meet again.
3332974 3335184 Oh, no, ma'am, that wouldn't be fittin'.
3337436 3339939 - Good night, Miss Wilkes.<br />- Good night, Mrs. Watling.
3345653 3347697 And you're wrong about Mrs. Kennedy.
3347822 3350116 She's brokenhearted about her husband.
3394368 3396662 Great balls of fire! It's Rhett.
3422896 3425190 Miss Scarlett, Captain Butler here<br />to see you.
3425440 3427567 I told him you was prostrate with grief.
3427692 3430320 Tell him I'll be right down, Mammy.
3460934 3462268 She says she's comin'.
3462727 3465105 I don't know why she's comin'.<br />But she's a-comin'.
3465188 3466689 You don't like me, Mammy.
3466773 3469984 Now don't you argue with me, you don't.<br />You really don't.
3482080 3483456 It's no good, Scarlett.
3484123 3485041 What?
3485124 3486167 The cologne.
3486626 3488795 I'm sure I don't know what you mean.
3489295 3492465 I mean you've been drinking.<br />Brandy. Quite a lot.
3493424 3495927 Well, what if I have?<br />Is that any of your affair?
3498554 3500181 Don't drink alone, Scarlett.
3500390 3503309 People always find out<br />and it ruins the reputation.
3509816 3510942 What is it?
3510983 3512985 This is more than losing old Frank.
3513444 3514820 Oh, Rhett...
3514862 3515947 ...l'm so afraid.
3516322 3518991 I don't believe it.<br />You've never been afraid in your life.
3519075 3520534 I'm afraid now.
3520826 3522912 I'm afraid of dying and going to hell.
3524789 3527708 You look pretty healthy,<br />and maybe there isn't any hell.
3527792 3531003 Oh, there is. I know there is.<br />I was raised on it.
3531921 3535007 Well, far be it from me to question<br />the teachings of childhood.
3535633 3538344 Tell me what you've done<br />that hell yawns before you.
3539845 3542306 I ought never to have married Frank<br />to begin with.
3542640 3545100 He was Suellen's beau<br />and he loved her, not me.
3546018 3548729 And I made him miserable.<br />And I killed him.
3549271 3551190 Yes, I did! I killed him!
3554652 3559323 For the first time I'm finding out what it is<br />to be sorry for something I've done.
3559865 3561825 Here. Dry your eyes.
3563077 3566038 If you had it all to do over again,<br />you'd do no differently.
3566080 3568707 You're like the thief who isn't<br />the least bit sorry he stole...
3568791 3571627 ...but he's terribly, terribly sorry<br />he's going to jail.
3571877 3573837 I'm glad Mother's dead.
3574546 3577216 I'm glad she's dead so she can't see me.
3578217 3581011 I always wanted to be like her,<br />calm and kind and...
3582221 3584681 And I certainly have<br />turned out disappointing.
3586600 3590187 You know, Scarlett, I think you're<br />on the verge of a crying jag.
3598111 3600906 So I'll change the subject<br />and say what I came to say.
3601406 3602866 Say it, then, and get out!
3604284 3605285 What is it?
3605369 3607621 That I can't go on any longer without you.
3608288 3612417 You are the most ill-bred man to come here<br />at a time like this with your filthy...
3612501 3615003 I made up my mind that you were<br />the only woman for me...
3615087 3616963 ...the first day I saw you at Twelve Oaks.
3617047 3619299 Now that you've got the lumber mill<br />and Frank's money...
3619382 3621593 ...you won't come to me<br />as you did to the jail.
3621802 3623762 So I see I shall have to marry you.
3624638 3626306 I never heard of such bad taste.
3626389 3628767 Would you be more convinced<br />if I fell to my knees?
3628808 3630644 Turn me loose, you varmint,<br />and get out of here!
3630727 3633688 Forgive me for startling you<br />with the impetuosity of my sentiments...
3633772 3636441 ...my dear Scarlett.<br />I mean, my dear Mrs. Kennedy.
3636733 3639861 But it cannot have escaped your notice<br />that for some time past...
3639944 3643281 ...the friendship I have felt for you<br />has ripened into a deeper feeling.
3643323 3646743 A feeling more beautiful,<br />more pure, more sacred.
3647911 3649996 Dare I name it? Can it be love?
3650622 3653124 Get up off your knees.<br />I don't like your common jokes.
3653333 3655001 This is an honorable proposal of marriage...
3655084 3657587 ...made at what I consider<br />a most opportune moment.
3658755 3661716 I can't go all my life waiting<br />to catch you between husbands.
3662342 3664511 You're coarse, and you're conceited.
3665511 3668097 And I think this conversation<br />has gone far enough.
3669015 3671476 Besides, I shall never marry again.
3672560 3675021 Oh, yes, you will, and you'll marry me.
3675605 3677315 You? You!
3678066 3679442 I don't love you!
3679942 3682195 And I don't like being married.
3683196 3685406 Did you ever think of marrying just for fun?
3685615 3688993 Marriage, fun? Fiddle-dee-dee.<br />Fun for men, you mean.
3690203 3691913 Hush up! Do you want them to hear you?
3691996 3694165 You've been married to a boy<br />and an old man.
3694499 3697543 Why not try a husband of the right age,<br />with a way with women?
3698419 3702924 You're a fool, Rhett Butler, when you know<br />I shall always love another man.
3704258 3707511 Stop it! Do you hear me, Scarlett?<br />Stop it! No more of that talk.
3713893 3715394 Rhett, don't, I shall faint.
3715436 3718105 I want you to faint.<br />This is what you were meant for.
3718356 3721108 None of the fools you've known<br />have kissed you like this, have they?
3721192 3723778 Your Charles, or your Frank,<br />or your stupid Ashley.
3732328 3735414 Say you're going to marry me.<br />Say "yes." Say "yes!"
3735664 3736707 Yes.
3739001 3741503 Are you sure you meant it?<br />You don't want to take it back?
3741587 3742588 No.
3743255 3745382 Look at me and try to tell me the truth.
3745925 3747927 Did you say "yes" because of my money?
3748552 3749511 Well...
3749762 3751221 Yes. Partly.
3752473 3753557 Partly?
3754266 3759021 Well, you know, Rhett, money does help,<br />and, of course I am fond of you.
3759188 3760230 Fond of me.
3760272 3763734 Well, if I said I was madly in love with you,<br />you'd know I was lying...
3763901 3765736 ...but you always said<br />we had a lot in common...
3765819 3767321 Yes, you're right, my dear.
3767821 3770157 I'm not in love with you any more<br />than you are with me.
3770240 3772493 Heaven help the man<br />who ever really loves you.
3773243 3775120 What kind of a ring would you like,<br />my darling?
3775204 3778415 Oh, a diamond ring.<br />And do buy a great big one, Rhett.
3778457 3781460 You shall have the biggest<br />and the most vulgar ring in Atlanta.
3781793 3783754 I'll take you to New Orleans<br />for the most expensive honeymoon...
3783879 3785422 ...my ill-gotten gains can buy.
3785464 3786965 Oh, that would be just heavenly.
3787215 3789259 And I think I'll buy your trousseau<br />for you, too.
3789343 3790927 Rhett, how wonderful, but...
3791720 3793889 ...you won't tell anybody, will you, Rhett?
3794348 3795807 Still the little hypocrite.
3798560 3800645 Rhett, aren't you going<br />to kiss me goodbye?
3800729 3803440 Don't you think you've had enough kissing<br />for one afternoon?
3803482 3804608 You're impossible.
3804649 3807068 You can go and I don't care<br />if you never come back.
3807152 3808487 But I will come back.
3823460 3825503 What are you thinking about, Scarlett?
3825629 3827505 I'm thinking about how rich we are.
3829507 3831843 Rhett, I can keep<br />the lumber business too, can't I?
3831885 3834095 Yes, of course, you can, if it amuses you.
3834345 3836973 Now that you're rich<br />you can tell everyone to go to the devil...
3837057 3838475 ...as you've always said you wanted to.
3838850 3841436 But you were the main one<br />I wanted to go to the devil.
3859245 3862707 Don't scrape the plate, Scarlett.<br />I'm sure there's more in the kitchen.
3863041 3866502 Oh, Rhett, can I have one of those<br />chocolate ones stuffed with meringue?
3867003 3870298 If you don't stop being such a glutton,<br />you'll get as fat as Mammy...
3870381 3871841 ...then I'll divorce you.
3872675 3875386 Wouldn't it be nice if you bought<br />something for Mammy, too?
3875470 3878473 Why should I buy her a present<br />when she called us both mules?
3879223 3880558 Mules? Why mules?
3880850 3884729 Yes, she said we could give ourselves airs,<br />and get ourselves all slicked up...
3884770 3887023 ...like racehorses but we were just mules<br />in horse harness...
3887064 3888691 ...and we didn't fool anybody.
3889734 3891527 I never heard anything more true.
3891569 3893154 Mammy's a smart old soul...
3893446 3896741 ...and one of the few people I know<br />whose respect I'd like to have.
3897908 3899744 I won't give her a thing.<br />She doesn't deserve it.
3899785 3901537 Then I'll take her a petticoat.
3901620 3903831 My Mammy always said<br />when she went to heaven...
3903914 3907877 ...she wanted a red taffeta petticoat,<br />so stiff that it would stand by itself...
3908127 3911172 ...and so rustly, the Lord would think<br />it was made of angels' wings.
3911255 3914300 Why, she won't take it from you.<br />She'd rather die than wear it.
3914467 3917261 That may be, but I'm making the gesture<br />just the same.
3921932 3924143 Wake up! Wake up!
3925936 3927813 You were having another nightmare.
3929106 3930149 Oh, Rhett.
3930566 3932735 When I was so cold and hungry and...
3932818 3934320 ...and so tired I...
3934945 3938907 ...I couldn't find it. I ran through the mist<br />and I couldn't find it.
3939742 3941744 - Find what, honey?<br />- Oh, I don't know.
3942494 3945039 I always dream the same dream<br />and I never know.
3945664 3947499 It seems to be hidden in the mist.
3947750 3948834 Darling.
3950127 3954256 Rhett, do you think I'll ever dream<br />that I've found it and that I'm safe?
3955632 3959720 Dreams don't work that way, but when<br />you get used to being safe and warm...
3960179 3962097 ...you'll stop dreaming that dream.
3962472 3965517 And, Scarlett, I'm going to see<br />that you are safe.
3969813 3972107 Would you do something<br />for me if I asked you?
3972566 3973775 You know I would.
3975027 3977321 Will you take me away from here?
3977654 3979114 Don't you like New Orleans?
3979156 3982701 Oh, I love New Orleans,<br />but I want to go home and visit Tara.
3984119 3985662 Will you take me to Tara?
3986496 3990959 Yes, Scarlett, of course I will.<br />We'll go tomorrow.
3994379 3997174 You get your strength<br />from this red earth of Tara, Scarlett.
3997257 3999301 You're part of it, and it's part of you.
3999384 4002971 Rhett, I'd give anything to have Tara<br />the way it was before the war.
4003179 4006099 Would you?<br />Then go ahead and make it that way.
4006641 4009936 Spend whatever you want,<br />make it as fine a plantation as it ever was.
4010562 4012022 Oh, Rhett.
4012647 4014149 Rhett, you are good to me.
4014482 4016818 And can we still have<br />our big new house in Atlanta?
4016901 4019446 Yes, and it can be as ornate as you want...
4019904 4022282 ...marbled terraces, stained-glass windows<br />and all.
4022365 4024242 Rhett, won't everyone be jealous?
4024325 4027454 I want everybody who's been mean to me<br />to be pea-green with envy.
4029289 4033459 I don't care. Scarlett's hateful,<br />building that new house just to show off...
4033585 4035837 ...and even taking our servants.
4036796 4039716 Oh, darling, you mustn't think<br />unkindly of her.
4040174 4042760 She's made it possible for us<br />to keep Tara always.
4043261 4044846 Yes, and what good is Tara?
4045346 4048891 She's had three husbands<br />and I'll be an old maid.
4051936 4053730 Great Jehosophat!
4054564 4056232 Great Jehosophat!
4056649 4058693 Lordsy, we sure is rich now!
4058901 4059986 It ain't quality...
4060445 4062655 But that's ridiculous. Why can't I go in?
4063448 4065867 I'm entitled to at least see<br />what my own child looks like.
4065950 4069412 You control yourself, Mr. Rhett.<br />You'll be seein' it for a long time.
4070246 4072957 I'd like to apologize, Mr. Rhett,<br />about it's not being a boy.
4073040 4075251 Oh, hush your mouth, Mammy.<br />Who wants a boy?
4075585 4078754 Boys aren't any use to anybody.<br />Don't you think I'm proof of that?
4079547 4081382 Have a drink of sherry, Mammy.
4081465 4083968 Mammy, she is beautiful, isn't she?
4084302 4085594 She sure is.
4086512 4088139 Did you ever see a prettier one?
4088222 4092143 Well, sir, Miss Scarlett was mighty nigh<br />that pretty when she come, but not quite.
4092601 4094019 Have another glass, Mammy.
4098691 4100776 What's that rustling noise I hear?
4100860 4105072 Lordsy, Mr. Rhett. That ain't nothin' but<br />my red silk petticoat you done give me.
4105156 4108284 Nothing but your petticoat.<br />I don't believe it. Let me see.
4108325 4109493 Pull up your skirt.
4109994 4111620 Mr. Rhett. You is bad.
4112663 4113747 Yeah, oh, Lord!
4119837 4122381 You sure took a long enough time<br />about wearing it.
4123048 4124675 Yes, sir, too long.
4125384 4127344 No more mule in horse's harness?
4127678 4130639 Mr. Rhett, Miss Scarlett was bad<br />tellin' you about that.
4130973 4133517 You ain't holdin' that<br />against old Mammy, is you?
4133976 4136812 No, I ain't holding it against you.<br />I just wanted to know.
4136854 4139648 Have another glass, Mammy.<br />Here, take the whole bottle.
4139857 4142276 Dr. Meade says you may go in now,<br />Captain Butler.
4146196 4148115 This sure is a happy day to me.
4148407 4151243 I done diapered three generations<br />of this family's girls...
4151702 4153787 ...and it sure is a happy day.
4153954 4157332 Oh, yes, Mammy.<br />The happiest days are when babies come.
4157374 4158542 I wish...
4159126 4162295 Oh, Mammy, she's beautiful.<br />What do you suppose they'll name her?
4162379 4164798 Miss Scarlett done told me if it was a girl...
4164881 4167968 ...she's goin' to name it Eugenia Victoria.
4168802 4169886 Yes...
4170095 4172055 ...she's a beautiful baby...
4172806 4175225 ...the most beautiful baby ever.
4176268 4177477 Yes.
4179020 4181356 Do you know that this is your birthday?
4182065 4184192 That you're a week old today?
4184860 4190031 Yes, I'm going to buy her a pony the likes<br />of which this town has never seen.
4190740 4193868 Yes, I'm gonna send her<br />to the best schools in Charleston.
4194327 4198415 Yes. And her'll be received<br />by the best families in the South.
4199207 4201668 And when it comes time for her to marry...
4201751 4204713 ...well, she'll be a little princess.
4205630 4207590 You certainly are making a fool of yourself.
4207882 4209134 And why shouldn't I?
4210176 4213096 She's the first person<br />who's ever completely belonged to me.
4214472 4216182 Great balls of fire!
4216266 4217767 I had the baby, didn't I?
4218726 4220270 It's Melanie. May I come in?
4220353 4221396 Come in, Melly.
4221604 4224983 Yes, come in and look at my daughter's<br />beautiful blue eyes.
4227277 4230113 But, Captain Butler, most babies have<br />blue eyes when they're born.
4230196 4233157 Don't try to tell him anything.<br />He knows everything about babies.
4233241 4236327 Nevertheless, her eyes are blue<br />and they're going to stay blue.
4236494 4238413 As blue as the bonnie blue flag.
4239414 4241708 That's it. That's what we'll call her.
4241958 4243126 Bonnie Blue Butler.
4251968 4253094 Try again, Mammy.
4261143 4262270 Twenty inches.
4262812 4265773 Twenty inches!<br />I've grown as big as Aunt Pitty.
4266399 4268943 You've simply got to make it<br />18 and a half again, Mammy.
4268985 4270528 You done had a baby, Miss Scarlett...
4270611 4272989 ...and you ain't never goin' to be<br />no 18 and a half inches again.
4273030 4275408 Never. And there ain't nothin'<br />to do about it.
4276617 4278619 There is something to do about it!
4278828 4281455 I'm just not going to get old and fat<br />before my time.
4282581 4284500 I just won't have any more babies!
4285459 4288504 I heard Mr. Rhett say<br />that he'll be wantin' a son next year.
4289255 4292091 Go tell Captain Butler<br />I've decided not to go out after all.
4292174 4293801 I'll have supper in my room.
4314446 4318200 I got your message.<br />I'll have them bring my supper up here too.
4325207 4326875 No objections to that, I hope?
4327000 4328126 No.
4329378 4330379 Yes.
4332381 4334716 I mean, I don't care<br />where you have your supper.
4337511 4338512 Rhett?
4339471 4340430 Yes?
4340514 4341515 You see...
4342099 4343767 ...well, I've decided...
4346019 4348355 ...well, I hope I don't have<br />any more children.
4361118 4364037 My pet, as I told you<br />before Bonnie was born...
4364913 4367916 ...it's immaterial to me<br />whether you have one child or 20!
4368041 4369543 No, but you know what I...
4370293 4371836 Do you know what I mean?
4371920 4375006 I do. And do you know<br />I can divorce you for this?
4376258 4378468 You're just low enough<br />to think of something like that!
4378551 4382305 If you had any chivalry in you or would<br />be nice like, well, look at Ashley Wilkes!
4382389 4384891 Melanie can't have any more children<br />and he...
4387310 4390021 You've been to the lumber office<br />this afternoon, haven't you?
4390105 4391773 What has that got to do with it?
4393400 4396653 Quite the little gentleman, Ashley.<br />Pray go on, Mrs. Butler.
4396861 4399114 It's no use. You wouldn't understand.
4400406 4402408 You know, I'm sorry for you, Scarlett.
4402492 4403535 Sorry for me?
4403785 4407330 Yes, sorry for you because you're throwing<br />away happiness with both hands...
4407455 4409874 ...and reaching out for something<br />that will never make you happy.
4409958 4411542 I don't know what you're talking about.
4411626 4414545 If you were free and Miss Melly were dead<br />and you had your precious...
4414629 4417507 ...honorable Ashley, do you think<br />you'd be happy with him?
4418800 4421761 You'd never know him,<br />never even understand his mind...
4422512 4425473 ...any more than you understand anything<br />except money.
4425807 4427767 Never mind about that!<br />What I want to know is...
4427850 4431354 You may keep your sanctity, Scarlett.<br />It'll work no hardship on me.
4432271 4433773 Do you mean to say you don't care?
4433856 4437443 The world is full of many things<br />and many people, and I shan't be lonely.
4438110 4439654 I'll find comfort elsewhere.
4440112 4441948 Well, that's fine. But I warn you.
4442198 4445117 Just in case you change your mind,<br />I intend to lock my door.
4445409 4448871 Why bother? If I wanted to come in,<br />no lock could keep me out!
4467515 4470851 I always knew that most women<br />were cheats, hypocritical and hard.
4470976 4473395 - But this one...<br />- Rhett, it ain't no use.
4473479 4476190 - What do you mean?<br />- I mean you're poisoned with her.
4476440 4479777 I don't care what she's done to you,<br />you're still in love with her.
4479902 4481779 And don't think it pleasures me none<br />to say it.
4481862 4484740 Maybe so! But I'm through with her,<br />I tell you! I'm through.
4484823 4488077 You gotta think of the child.<br />The child's worth ten of the mother.
4494750 4497461 You're a shrewd woman, Belle,<br />and a very nice one.
4499630 4500631 Yes, Rhett?
4500714 4503592 I was just thinking of the difference<br />between you, and...
4504343 4507721 ...you're both hard-headed business women<br />and you're both successful.
4507888 4509723 But you've got a heart, Belle...
4511600 4512893 ...and you're honest.
4515687 4516855 Goodbye, Rhett.
4518148 4519399 Goodbye, Belle.
4535290 4537417 She'll be a wonderful horsewoman!
4537667 4539711 Look at those hands, and that seat!
4540003 4541296 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!
4541463 4544424 Just why we have to wheel the baby<br />when we have a house full of servants...
4544466 4545550 Good morning, Mrs. Merriwether.
4545634 4547135 Good morning, Captain Butler.
4547219 4548553 Good morning, Scarlett.
4548637 4551515 Making fools of ourselves<br />in front of these old buffaloes!
4551640 4554518 If you'd thought of your position years ago,<br />you wouldn't have to do this.
4554601 4558813 But as it is, we'll cultivate every female<br />dragon of the old guard in this town.
4559814 4561233 Good morning, Mrs. Whiting.
4561316 4564611 Good morning, Captain Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
4565362 4568114 So the millionaire speculator's<br />turning respectable!
4568823 4570992 All of our money can't buy<br />what I want for Bonnie.
4571076 4573286 Oh, I'll admit I've been at fault, too.
4573370 4575705 But Bonnie's going to have a place<br />among decent people.
4575789 4579375 Yes, even if we both have to crawl<br />on our bellies to every fat old cat.
4580335 4582045 Good morning, Mrs. Meade.
4582337 4585006 Good morning, Captain Butler.<br />Good morning, Scarlett.
4591554 4594515 Mrs. Merriwether, I've always had<br />a great regard for your knowledge.
4594557 4596267 I wonder if you could give me some advice.
4596351 4597310 Why, certainly, Captain Butler.
4597393 4599687 My Bonnie sucks her thumb.<br />I can't make her stop it.
4599771 4602190 You should make her stop it.<br />It'll ruin the shape of her mouth.
4602273 4603316 I know, I know.
4603441 4606986 She has such a beautiful mouth, too.<br />I tried putting soap under her nails.
4607153 4608237 Soap! Bah!
4608321 4611824 Put quinine on her thumb<br />and she'll stop sucking it quick enough.
4612033 4614577 Quinine! I never would have thought of it.
4614994 4617121 I can't thank you enough,<br />Mrs. Merriwether.
4617205 4620291 You've taken a great load off my mind!<br />Good morning.
4624045 4625296 Good morning, Dolly.
4625463 4626923 Wasn't that Captain Butler?
4627173 4629634 Good morning, Caroline.<br />I was just thinking.
4630092 4634138 There must be a great deal of good<br />in a man who could love a child so much.
4634263 4635890 But of course there is!
4636223 4639936 Oh, did I tell you that Fanny Elsing<br />told Dr. Meade that Captain Butler...
4640061 4642772 ...finally admitted he was honored<br />by the Confederate Congress...
4642855 4644982 ...for his services at the Battle of Franklin?
4645066 4648527 No! And did I tell you, Caroline,<br />that Captain Butler...
4648611 4651822 ...made a stupendous contribution<br />to the Association for the Beautification...
4651906 4653824 ...of the Graves of the Glorious Dead?
4653908 4654867 No!
4655618 4659330 My little grandbaby, Napoleon Picard,<br />is giving a party for Bonnie next week.
4659580 4662333 Why, Dolly Merriwether,<br />you know right well it was my idea...
4662416 4663751 ...to give a party for Bonnie Butler!
4663834 4665169 Why Caroline Meade...
4674386 4677306 Now watch Daddy put your pony over,<br />Bonnie. Now watch.
4680559 4682853 Daddy, let me! Let me!
4683020 4685356 All right, darling. Put her on, Pork!
4689068 4690194 Up we go.
4690527 4691820 Oh, there!
4692112 4694656 Lordsy mercy! There he goes again!
4694782 4698076 Grip tightly with your legs and sit close.<br />Lean forward and be sure you go with him.
4698118 4700954 Hold your reins properly in a firm hand.<br />Up!
4702122 4704333 That was fine! I knew you'd do it!
4704625 4707502 When you get a little older,<br />I'll take you to Kentucky and Virginia.
4707586 4711048 You'll be the greatest horsewoman<br />in the South. Give your daddy a kiss.
4712174 4713467 Mr. Rhett! Mr. Rhett!
4714635 4715636 Mr. Rhett!
4716637 4718889 Did you see her, Mammy?<br />Wasn't she wonderful?
4719306 4723268 Mr. Rhett, I done told you and told you<br />it just ain't fittin'...
4723310 4726438 ...for a girl child to ride astraddle<br />with her dress flyin' up!
4726605 4728982 All right, Mammy.<br />I'll teach her to ride sidesaddle.
4729024 4732277 And I'll buy her a blue velvet riding habit.<br />She'll love that.
4732319 4734654 A nice black broadcloth is<br />what little girls wear.
4734696 4736823 Now, Mammy, be reasonable.
4737324 4739534 Well, I don't think it's fittin', but...
4741578 4743705 It ain't fittin', it just ain't fittin'.
4745498 4746791 It ain't fittin'.
4757010 4758219 Why, Scarlett!
4759012 4760972 What are you doing downtown<br />at this time of day?
4761056 4762057 Ashley, I just...
4762140 4765518 Why aren't you helping Melly get ready<br />for my surprise birthday party?
4765769 4769063 Why, Ashley Wilkes, you aren't supposed<br />to know anything about that.
4769522 4772066 Melly'd be so disappointed<br />if you weren't surprised.
4772233 4775445 I won't let on.<br />I'll be the most surprised man in Atlanta.
4776613 4778740 As long as you're here,<br />let me show you the books...
4778823 4781618 ...so you can see just how bad<br />a businessman I really am.
4781701 4783828 Oh, don't let's fool with any books today.
4784162 4786706 When I'm wearing a new bonnet,<br />all the figures I ever knew...
4786789 4788541 ...go right slap out of my head.
4788583 4791836 The figures are well lost<br />when the bonnet's as pretty as that one.
4792295 4795256 Scarlett, you know,<br />you get prettier all the time.
4796257 4800053 You haven't changed a bit since the day<br />of our last barbecue at Twelve Oaks...
4800595 4803556 ...where you sat under a tree<br />surrounded by dozens of beaux.
4805683 4808060 That girl doesn't exist anymore.
4808603 4811147 Nothing's turned out as I expected, Ashley.
4811481 4812565 Nothing.
4813274 4816986 Yes, we've travelled a long road<br />since the old days, haven't we, Scarlett?
4817653 4819196 Oh, the lazy days...
4819447 4821657 ...the warm, still country twilights...
4822950 4825536 ...the high, soft negro laughter<br />from the quarters...
4826787 4829999 ...the golden warmth and security<br />of those days.
4832251 4833711 Don't look back, Ashley.
4834462 4835588 Don't look back.
4837757 4842428 It drags at your heart<br />till you can't do anything, but look back.
4847600 4849685 I didn't mean to make you sad, my dear.
4850978 4853939 I'd never want you to be anything<br />but completely happy.
4874418 4875461 Oh, Ashley!
4878046 4879089 Who is it?
4879173 4880340 Only your husband.
4881467 4882259 Come in.
4883510 4885971 Am I actually being invited<br />into the sanctuary?
4887514 4889474 You're not ready for Melanie's party.
4890017 4891476 I've got a headache, Rhett.
4891602 4894062 You go without me,<br />and make my excuses to Melanie.
4896064 4898525 What a white-livered little coward you are!<br />Get up!
4899026 4901653 You're going to that party<br />and you'll have to hurry.
4902070 4903947 - Has India dared to...<br />- Yes. India has!
4904031 4905991 Every woman and man in town<br />knows the story!
4906074 4907534 You should kill them, spreading lies.
4907576 4910287 I have a strange way of not killing people<br />who tell the truth.
4910370 4911663 There's no time to argue now. Get up!
4911747 4914916 I won't go! I can't go<br />until this misunderstanding is cleared up.
4915000 4917586 You won't cheat Miss Melly<br />out of the satisfaction of publicly...
4917669 4919045 ...ordering you out of her house.
4919129 4920839 There was nothing wrong.<br />India hates me so.
4920922 4922841 I can't go, Rhett. I couldn't face it.
4922883 4926386 If you don't show it tonight,<br />you'll never be able to as long as you live.
4926469 4929389 While that wouldn't bother me,<br />you're ruining Bonnie's chances.
4929431 4932767 You're going to that party,<br />if only for her sake. Now, get dressed!
4946322 4949743 Wear that! Nothing modest or matronly<br />will do for this occasion.
4950243 4953246 And put on plenty of rouge.<br />I want you to look your part tonight.
4960545 4965675 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow
4965842 4970888 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny
4971306 4975018 "Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny
4975768 4978187 "For he's a jolly good fellow..."
4979981 4982525 - Good night, Scarlett.<br />- But Rhett, you can't...
4982608 4985570 You go into the arena alone.<br />The lions are hungry for you.
4985778 4987363 Oh, Rhett, don't leave me. Don't.
4987447 4988573 You're not afraid?
4988781 4990908 "Which nobody can deny<br />Which nobody can deny
4990992 4995580 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />For he's a jolly good fellow
4995663 5000960 "For he's a jolly good fellow<br />Which nobody can deny."
5015474 5017476 What a lovely dress, Scarlett, darling.
5017810 5019478 India wasn't able to come tonight.
5019562 5020813 Will you be an angel?
5020855 5023357 I do need you to help me<br />receive my guests.
5027153 5028612 Mrs. Meade...
5028821 5030448 ...here's our darling Scarlett.
5032491 5033576 Good evening.
5033659 5034743 Good evening.
5034994 5036078 Why Scarlett!
5036829 5039707 - Good evening, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good evening, Mrs. Butler.
5040499 5043627 Ashley, aren't you going to get<br />our Scarlett a glass of punch?
5051552 5054513 Did you have a good time tonight<br />at Miss Melly's party, child?
5054555 5055597 Yes, yes.
5055681 5057516 Now, Mammy, be sure and leave word...
5057599 5060686 ...if Captain Butler asks for me<br />when he comes back, I'm asleep.
5061061 5062062 Yes, ma'am.
5091508 5092801 Come in, Mrs. Butler.
5102310 5103437 Come here.
5119327 5120370 Sit down!
5123039 5126668 There's no reason why you shouldn't have<br />your nightcap even if I am here.
5126793 5128962 I didn't want a drink. I heard a noise and...
5129045 5130797 You heard nothing of the kind.
5131381 5134092 You wouldn't have come down<br />if you'd thought I was here.
5134259 5136469 - You must need a drink badly.<br />- I do not!
5136553 5139347 Take it. Don't give yourself airs.
5139431 5142475 I know you drink on the quiet,<br />and I know how much you drink.
5142934 5145228 Do you think I care if you like your brandy?
5152360 5153695 You're drunk, and I'm going to bed!
5153778 5155238 I'm very drunk...
5155613 5158783 ...and I intend getting still drunker<br />before the evening's over...
5159534 5162287 ...but you're not going to bed, not yet!
5163538 5164664 Sit down!
5167875 5169794 So she stood by you, did she?
5171045 5174632 How does it feel to have the woman<br />you've wronged cloak your sins for you?
5176342 5179011 You're wondering if she knows<br />all about you and Ashley.
5179554 5182140 You're wondering if she did it<br />just to save her face.
5182807 5186435 You're thinking that she's a fool for doing it<br />even if it did save your hide.
5186519 5188646 - I will not listen.<br />- Yes, you'll listen!
5189730 5192149 Miss Melly's a fool,<br />but not the kind you think.
5193025 5196195 It's just that there's too much honor in her<br />to ever conceive of dishonor...
5196279 5197863 ...in anyone she loves.
5198781 5200032 And she loves you.
5200825 5203661 Though just why she does,<br />I'm sure I don't know!
5204829 5208082 If you weren't so drunk and insulting,<br />I could explain everything.
5208541 5211460 - As it is though...<br />- lf you get out of that chair once more!
5215881 5220511 Of course, the comic figure in all this is<br />the long suffering Mr. Wilkes!
5221554 5224515 Mr. Wilkes, who can't be<br />mentally faithful to his wife...
5224598 5227184 ...and won't be unfaithful to her technically.
5228852 5230604 Why doesn't he make up his mind?
5230729 5231814 Rhett, you...
5235234 5237653 Observe my hands, my dear.
5238654 5241073 I could tear you to pieces with them.
5241740 5245285 And I'd do it, if it'd take Ashley<br />out of your mind forever.
5246370 5247913 But it wouldn't.
5248747 5252543 So I'll remove him<br />from your mind forever this way.
5253752 5255838 I'll put my hands so...
5256713 5258841 ...one on each side of your head...
5259842 5263887 ...and I'll smash your skull between them<br />like a walnut.
5264721 5266932 And that'll block him out.
5268225 5270894 Take your hands off me, you drunken fool.
5276191 5279403 You know I've always admired<br />your spirit, my dear.
5280404 5282698 Never more than now,<br />when you're cornered.
5283865 5285033 I'm not cornered.
5285283 5288120 And you'll never corner me,<br />Rhett Butler, or frighten me!
5288203 5291373 You've lived in dirt so long,<br />you can't understand anything else.
5291790 5295502 And you're jealous of something<br />you can't understand. Good night!
5298046 5299422 Jealous, am I?
5299506 5301049 Yes, I suppose I am.
5301925 5304928 Even though I know you've been faithful<br />to me all along.
5305553 5306763 How do I know?
5306930 5310100 Because I know Ashley Wilkes,<br />and his honorable breed.
5310684 5311768 They're gentlemen!
5312435 5315105 And that's more than I can say<br />for you or for me!
5316106 5319609 We're not gentlemen,<br />and we have no honor, have we?
5329285 5331371 It's not that easy, Scarlett.
5335708 5337669 You turned me out<br />while you chased Ashley Wilkes.
5337752 5339546 While you dreamed of Ashley Wilkes.
5339629 5341839 This is one night<br />you're not turning me out!
5370368 5372495 How are you feeling this morning, Mammy?
5372537 5376415 Well, this misery in my back ain't so good.
5379377 5381921 You actin' mighty happy this mornin',<br />Miss Scarlett.
5382046 5383547 I am, Mammy. I am.
5390680 5395518 "Oh, she wept with delight<br />when he gave her a smile
5396018 5400564 "And trembled with fear at his frown."
5417456 5418499 Hello.
5421335 5424922 I'd like to extend my apologies<br />for my conduct of last night.
5425214 5426382 Oh, but Rhett...
5426924 5428133 I was very drunk...
5428217 5431470 ...and quite swept off my feet<br />by your charms.
5433722 5437267 Well, you needn't bother to apologize.<br />Nothing you ever do surprises me!
5437976 5440771 I've been thinking things over,<br />and I really believe that...
5440854 5442356 ...it would be better for both of us...
5442439 5445150 ...if we admitted we'd made a mistake<br />and got a divorce.
5445359 5446610 - A divorce?<br />- Yes.
5447110 5449738 There's no point in our holding on<br />to each other, is there?
5449821 5452366 I'll provide for you amply.<br />You've plenty of grounds.
5452449 5455285 Just give me Bonnie. You can say<br />what you please, I won't contest it.
5455327 5456328 Thank you very much.
5456411 5459414 But I wouldn't dream of disgracing<br />the family with a divorce.
5460165 5462668 You'd disgrace it quick enough<br />if Ashley were free.
5462751 5465754 It makes my head spin to think<br />how quickly you'd divorce me.
5466880 5468298 Wouldn't you, Scarlett?
5469716 5470926 Well, answer me.
5471009 5472052 Wouldn't you?
5472135 5474346 Will you please go now,<br />and leave me alone?
5475889 5478225 Yes, I'm going.<br />That's what I came to tell you.
5479226 5482646 I'm going on a very extended trip<br />to London, and I'm leaving today.
5483980 5485607 And I'm taking Bonnie with me.
5485690 5488151 So you'll please get<br />her little duds packed right away.
5488235 5490487 You'll never take my child<br />out of this house.
5490862 5492739 She's my child, too, Scarlett.
5492864 5494950 You're making a mistake,<br />if you think I'm leaving her here...
5495033 5497661 ...with a mother who hasn't the decency<br />to consider her own reputation.
5497744 5499162 You're a fine one to talk.
5499746 5501164 You think I'll let that child out<br />of this house...
5501206 5504834 ...when you'll probably have her around<br />with people like that Belle?
5504959 5507337 If you were a man<br />I'd break your neck for that.
5507712 5509881 As it is, I'll thank you<br />to shut your stupid mouth.
5509964 5512842 As for you, giving yourself pious airs<br />about your motherhood...
5512884 5515178 Why, a cat's a better mother than you are.
5515261 5518223 Have her things packed and ready<br />for me in an hour, or I warn you...
5518306 5522143 I've always thought a good lashing with a<br />buggy whip would benefit you immensely.
5527607 5528858 Excuse me, Mr. Rhett.
5529901 5530944 Hello, Uncle Rhett.
5531027 5532487 Hello, hello, Beau.
5532528 5533863 Daddy, Daddy!
5534280 5537617 Where have you been?<br />I've been waiting for you all morning.
5537825 5541329 Well, I've been hunting for a rabbit skin<br />to wrap my little Bonnie in.
5541537 5543414 Give your best sweetheart a kiss.
5546876 5549962 I'm going to take you<br />on a long trip to fairyland!
5551005 5552298 Where? Where?
5552715 5556302 I'm going to show you the Tower<br />of London, where the little princes were...
5556594 5557929 ...and London Bridge.
5558596 5560056 London Bridge!
5560139 5561933 Will it be falling down?
5563434 5565728 Well, it will if you want it to, darling.
5568272 5570399 Daddy, dark!
5571776 5573235 Dark!
5573444 5574445 Daddy! Dark!
5576489 5579241 It's all right.<br />Who put out that light? Nurse!
5579283 5580743 Daddy, dark!
5582036 5583120 Daddy, dark!
5583204 5584872 There. Yes, yes.
5585456 5587249 What's the matter with my Bonnie?
5587416 5588709 A bear.
5589126 5591420 Oh, a bear? A big bear?
5591879 5594757 Dreadful big. And he sat on my chest.
5594882 5598177 Well, I'll stay here and shoot him<br />if he comes back.
5613400 5615027 Good evening, Mr. Butler.
5618238 5620949 Haven't I told you never to leave her alone<br />in the dark?
5621033 5624995 If you'll pardon me, sir, children are often<br />afraid of the dark, but they get over it.
5625078 5626789 If you just let her scream<br />for a night or two.
5626830 5630834 Let her scream! Either you're a fool or<br />the most inhuman woman I've ever seen!
5630918 5633503 Of course, sir, if you want her<br />to grow up nervous and cowardly.
5633587 5634588 Cowardly!
5634796 5638175 There isn't a cowardly bone in her body.<br />You're discharged!
5639051 5640218 As you say, sir.
5657235 5658737 Where is Mother?
5665285 5667412 Aren't you happy here in London with me?
5668079 5670582 I want to go home.
5682761 5684137 Miss Bonnie!
5684429 5686306 And Captain Butler!
5686639 5688475 - Miss Scarlett!<br />- Hello, Mammy.
5688725 5689976 Honey, child!
5691394 5694189 Miss Scarlett! They's back!<br />They's back, Miss Scarlett!
5694355 5695398 Bonnie!
5696483 5698401 Bonnie! Bonnie, baby!
5698735 5700028 Darling, baby!
5700069 5701488 Are you glad to be home?
5701571 5702906 Daddy gave me a kitten.
5703198 5706451 - What a little, lovely kitten!<br />- London's a horrid place.
5706993 5709245 - Oh, my darling.<br />- Where's my pony?
5709454 5712665 - I want to go out and see my pony.<br />- You go out and see your pony.
5722133 5723301 Where's my pony?
5724802 5726554 I wanna go out and see my pony.
5727263 5729015 You run along with Mammy.
5729098 5730558 - Come on, honey child.<br />- Go with Mammy.
5730641 5732643 Mammy sure has missed you, honey.
5734812 5736272 Mrs. Butler, I believe.
5737273 5738774 Mammy said you'd come back.
5740276 5741736 But only to bring Bonnie.
5741819 5745239 Apparently any mother, even a bad one,<br />is better for a child than none.
5746032 5747783 You mean you're going away again?
5748200 5749744 What perception, Mrs. Butler.
5750119 5751245 Right away.
5751370 5753414 In fact, I left my bags at the station.
5755541 5758294 You're looking pale.<br />Is there a shortage of rouge?
5758794 5761297 Or can this wanness mean<br />you've been missing me?
5762214 5763758 If I'm pale, it's your fault.
5763841 5766260 Not because I've been missing you,<br />but because...
5770598 5772099 Pray continue, Mrs. Butler.
5773309 5775603 It's because I'm going to have a baby.
5781650 5782651 Indeed?
5783152 5784904 And who's the happy father?
5785696 5786947 You know it's yours.
5787281 5789074 I don't want it any more than you do.
5789158 5791285 No woman would want the child<br />of a cad like you.
5791368 5794079 I wish it were anybody's child but yours.
5796040 5798375 Well, cheer up.<br />Maybe you'll have an accident.
5813015 5814141 Is she better?
5818729 5820147 Has she asked for me?
5820189 5822316 Don't you understand? She's delirious.
5823859 5825652 Rhett!
5826903 5828530 I want Rhett!
5832826 5836121 What's the matter, honey?<br />Did you call somebody, child?
5836288 5837706 It's no use.
5838999 5840333 It's no use.
5862397 5863523 Dr. Meade's left.
5864983 5866192 Scarlett's dead!
5866401 5868111 Oh, no, she's much better.
5868695 5869738 Really she is.
5886754 5889382 There, there, Captain Butler.<br />You're beside yourself.
5889924 5892135 She'll very soon be well again,<br />I promise you.
5892218 5895179 No, you don't understand.<br />She never wanted this baby.
5895388 5897807 Not want a baby?<br />Why, every woman wants a baby!
5897932 5900810 Yes, you want children, but she doesn't.<br />Not my children.
5901227 5903354 She told me she didn't want<br />any more children...
5903438 5905481 ...and I wanted to hurt her<br />because she'd hurt me.
5905565 5906858 I wanted to and I did.
5906941 5910069 Hush. You mustn't tell me these things.<br />It's not fit.
5910111 5912947 I didn't know about this baby<br />until the other day when she fell.
5913031 5916033 If I'd known, I'd have come straight home<br />whether she wanted me or not!
5916117 5917702 Well, of course you would.
5917910 5921205 And then when she told me,<br />there on the steps, what did I do?
5921789 5924584 What did I say? I laughed and I said...
5924667 5927128 But you didn't mean it.<br />I know you didn't mean it.
5928087 5930506 Oh, but I did mean it.<br />I was crazy with jealousy.
5930840 5934468 She's never cared for me. I thought I could<br />make her care, but I couldn't.
5936429 5937638 You're so wrong.
5938055 5941392 Scarlett loves you a great deal,<br />much more than she knows.
5943019 5944979 If that were only true I could wait forever.
5945021 5947231 If she'd only forgive me,<br />forget this ever happened.
5947356 5948315 She will.
5948733 5950317 You must be patient.
5952737 5954155 Oh, no, it's not possible.
5954530 5957533 You don't understand.<br />If you only knew who she really loved...
5958659 5960244 ...you wouldn't believe it.
5963539 5965958 Surely you haven't listened to idle gossip.
5966208 5968669 No, Captain Butler, I wouldn't believe it.
5970754 5975134 There, there. Scarlett's going to get well<br />and there can be other babies.
5975426 5979179 Oh no, no, she couldn't even if she<br />wanted to, after what she's been through.
5979221 5981223 But of course she could.
5981724 5983142 I'm going to.
5986061 5989314 No, Miss Melly, you mustn't risk it.<br />It's too dangerous.
5989773 5992359 Children are life renewing itself,<br />Captain Butler...
5992901 5996405 ...and when life does that<br />danger seems very unimportant.
5999533 6002244 I've never before known anyone<br />who was really brave.
6003412 6005873 I pray God things go well with you,<br />Miss Melly.
6006498 6010002 And I want to thank you for all<br />you've done for me and for Scarlett.
6011461 6013130 From my heart, I thank you.
6020220 6022889 Miss Scarlett's feelin' a heap better today,<br />Mr. Rhett.
6023598 6024725 Thank you, Mammy.
6032274 6034234 I've come to ask your forgiveness...
6034609 6037487 ...in the hope that we can give<br />our life together another chance.
6037571 6038780 Our life together?
6039239 6041324 When did we ever have a life together?
6042659 6043869 Yes, you're right.
6044786 6048248 But I'm sure if we could only try again,<br />we could be happy.
6048957 6051251 Well, what is there to make us happy now?
6052168 6054337 Well, there's Bonnie and...
6055380 6057007 ...and I love you, Scarlett.
6057674 6059217 When did you discover that?
6059509 6062887 I've always loved you, but you've never<br />given me a chance to show it.
6064597 6067016 Well, and just what do you want me to do?
6068852 6071020 To begin with, give up the mill, Scarlett.
6071855 6073022 We'll go away.
6073106 6075191 We'll take Bonnie and we'll have<br />another honeymoon.
6075275 6078152 Give up the mill? But why?<br />It's making more money than ever.
6078194 6080154 Yes, I know, but we don't need it.
6080196 6082699 Sell it, or better still, give it to Ashley.
6083324 6085034 Melanie's been such a friend to both of us.
6085118 6087829 Always Melanie!<br />If you'd only think a little more about me...
6087912 6089247 I am thinking of you...
6090415 6092208 ...and I'm thinking that...
6092417 6095628 ...well, maybe it's the mill<br />that's taken you away from me...
6096087 6097422 ...and from Bonnie.
6097505 6100258 I know what you're thinking.<br />Don't try to bring Bonnie into this.
6100341 6101968 You're the one taking her away from me.
6102051 6103219 But she loves you.
6103302 6105721 You've done everything possible<br />to make her love you and not me.
6105805 6107056 Why, she's so spoiled now that...
6107140 6108474 Mommy! Daddy!
6108850 6109851 Watch me!
6110434 6111477 We're watching, darling.
6112270 6114021 You're mighty pretty, precious.
6114313 6115565 So are you.
6115982 6118609 I'm going to jump. Watch me, Daddy.
6119360 6122029 I don't think you ought to do<br />much jumping yet, Bonnie.
6122113 6124448 Remember, you've just learned<br />to ride sidesaddle.
6124532 6125866 I will so jump!
6125950 6128452 I can jump better than ever<br />'cause I've grown...
6128911 6130496 ...and I've moved the bar higher.
6130579 6131956 Don't let her do it, Rhett.
6132456 6136544 No, Bonnie, you can't. Well, if you fall off,<br />don't cry and blame me.
6137545 6139004 Rhett, stop her!
6141006 6142133 Bonnie!
6142925 6143926 Bonnie!
6145302 6146428 Just like Pa.
6150266 6151392 Just like Pa!
6153018 6154103 Bonnie!
6162695 6163696 Bonnie!
6164446 6165406 Bonnie!
6181922 6184925 Lordsy, Miss Melly.<br />I sure is glad you has come.
6187553 6190430 This house won't seem<br />the same without Bonnie.
6190514 6192182 How's Miss Scarlett bearing up?
6192432 6195269 Miss Melly, this here done<br />broke her heart...
6196019 6198605 ...but I didn't fetch you here<br />on Miss Scarlett's account.
6198689 6202901 What that child got to stand,<br />the good Lord give her strength to stand.
6204361 6206405 It's Mr. Rhett I's worried about.
6210200 6212702 He done lost his mind<br />these last couple of days.
6212786 6214246 No, Mammy, no.
6214704 6218625 I ain't never see'd no man, black or white,<br />set such store on any child.
6219459 6221545 When Dr. Meade says her neck broke...
6221920 6225632 ...Mr. Rhett grab his gun and run out there<br />and shoot that poor pony...
6226591 6229511 ...and for a minute I think<br />he going to shoot hisself.
6229678 6231471 Oh, poor Captain Butler.
6231513 6236268 Yes, ma'am. Miss Scarlett, she call him<br />a murderer for teachin' that child to jump.
6236768 6239145 She say, "You give me my baby<br />what you kill."
6239604 6243316 And then he say Miss Scarlett ain't<br />never cared nothin' about Miss Bonnie.
6243858 6247904 It like to turn my blood cold,<br />the things they say to one another.
6248405 6250448 Stop, Mammy, don't tell me any more.
6253701 6255453 And then that night...
6256496 6259874 ...Mr. Rhett, he locked hisself<br />in the nursery with Miss Bonnie...
6261084 6262627 ...and he wouldn't even open the door...
6262710 6264879 ...when Miss Scarlett beat on it<br />and hollered to him.
6264963 6267215 And that's the way it's been<br />for two whole days.
6267340 6268508 Oh, Mammy.
6269842 6272971 And then this evenin',<br />Miss Scarlett, she shout through the door...
6273263 6275473 ...and she say the funeral set<br />for tomorrow mornin'...
6275556 6278351 ...and he says "You try that<br />and I kills you tomorrow.
6278643 6281229 "Do you think I's goin'<br />to put my child away in the...
6281688 6283523 "...in the dark when she's so scared of it?"
6284023 6286859 Oh, Mammy, he has lost his mind.
6286901 6290446 Yes, ma'am, that's the God's truth.<br />He ain't goin' to let us bury that child.
6290530 6292240 You gotta help us, Miss Melly.
6292698 6294242 Oh, but I can't intrude.
6294408 6296410 If you can't help us, who can?
6296744 6299247 Mr. Rhett always set great store<br />by your opinion.
6301791 6303000 Please, Miss Melly.
6305127 6307046 I'll do what I can, Mammy.
6313719 6315888 Get away from that door,<br />and leave us alone.
6316222 6317973 It's Mrs. Wilkes, Captain Butler.
6318307 6319892 Please let me in.
6319975 6321560 I've come to see Bonnie.
6342957 6343958 Oh, Lord...
6344750 6347294 ...please help Mr. Rhett<br />in this hour of his grief.
6359723 6362768 I want you to go and make<br />a good deal of strong coffee...
6363018 6366605 ...and bring it up to Captain Butler.<br />I'll go and see Miss Scarlett.
6367106 6367981 But...
6368482 6371693 Captain Butler is quite willing<br />for the funeral to take place...
6371860 6373070 ...tomorrow morning.
6373153 6377866 Hallelujah. I suspects the angels fights<br />on your side, Miss Melly. Hallelujah.
6379159 6380786 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
6381662 6382496 Miss Melly!
6382621 6384289 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
6385999 6388001 Send for Dr. Meade, Mammy...
6388669 6389795 ...and try...
6390003 6391672 ...try to get me home.
6393382 6394925 Miss Melly! Miss Melly!
6402808 6405185 Where is my mother goin' away to?
6405352 6408271 And why can't I go along, please?
6408814 6412150 We can't always go along, Beau,<br />much as we may want to.
6413860 6415654 You're going back to bed now.
6416696 6419866 Oh, Rhett, she can't be dying, she can't be!
6420617 6422035 She hasn't your strength.
6422077 6425372 She's never had any strength.<br />She's never had anything but heart.
6425872 6427165 You knew that, too.
6427374 6430210 Why do I have to go back to bed?<br />It's morning.
6430919 6432962 It isn't really morning yet.
6439219 6440845 You may come in now, Scarlett.
6441054 6442388 Dr. Meade, please let me see her!
6442430 6446059 I've been waiting here two whole days<br />and I've got to tell her...
6446559 6448186 ...that I was wrong about something.
6448228 6450897 She knows you were wrong.<br />She wants to see Scarlett.
6454859 6456778 Miss Melly's going to die in peace.
6456861 6459197 I won't have you easing your conscience<br />telling her things...
6459238 6461616 ...that make no difference now.<br />You understand?
6476798 6477882 It's me, Melly.
6479759 6480885 Promise me?
6481928 6482929 Anything.
6484222 6485973 Look after my little son.
6487391 6489644 I gave him to you once before.
6490770 6492230 Remember?
6493105 6494482 The day he was born.
6495024 6498319 Please, Melly, don't talk this way.<br />I know you'll get well.
6499153 6500154 Promise me...
6501072 6502114 ...college...
6502239 6506410 Yes, yes, and Europe, and a pony,<br />whatever he wants. But...
6507620 6508829 ...Melly, do try...
6509246 6510206 Ashley...
6512291 6513417 Ashley and you.
6516086 6518839 What about Ashley, Melly?
6520341 6522551 Look after him for me.
6523302 6524512 Just as you...
6525971 6527556 ...looked after me for him.
6531518 6532603 I will, Melly.
6534229 6536565 Look after him...
6536649 6539526 ...but never let him know.
6549620 6550662 Good night.
6552581 6553582 Promise?
6555250 6556502 What else, Melly?
6557711 6559505 Captain Butler...
6560881 6562341 ...be kind to him.
6563050 6564092 Rhett?
6564885 6566511 He loves you so.
6570682 6571808 Yes, Melly.
6575020 6576146 Goodbye.
6577648 6578648 Goodbye.
6594873 6596416 You ladies may come in now.
6602422 6603757 Ashley.
6604633 6607218 I don't know where the mate to this is.
6608219 6609846 She must have put it away.
6610972 6612390 Oh, stop it.
6612932 6614017 Hold me.
6614434 6616019 I'm so frightened.
6617896 6619356 I'm so frightened.
6624444 6627989 Oh, Scarlett, what can I do?<br />I can't live without her, I can't.
6629616 6631075 Everything I ever had is...
6631576 6633077 ...is going with her.
6634287 6635580 Oh, Ashley.
6637081 6639000 You really love her, don't you?
6639792 6644505 She's the only dream I ever had<br />that didn't die in the face of reality.
6645423 6648384 Dreams! Always dreams with you,<br />never common sense.
6648635 6651137 Oh, Scarlett!<br />If you knew what I've gone through!
6652764 6656559 Ashley, you should have told me years ago<br />that you loved her and not me...
6656934 6659896 ...and not left me dangling<br />with your talk of honor.
6659979 6663191 But you had to wait till now,<br />now when Melly's dying...
6664108 6667069 ...to show me that I could never mean<br />any more to you than...
6667570 6669697 ...than this Watling woman does to Rhett.
6672074 6673910 And I've loved something that...
6674785 6676662 ...that doesn't really exist.
6679332 6680583 Somehow...
6681918 6683294 ...I don't care.
6684795 6686505 Somehow it doesn't matter.
6688674 6690301 It doesn't matter one bit.
6695389 6696932 Ashley, forgive me.
6697641 6700519 Don't cry.<br />She mustn't see you've been crying.
6701061 6702188 Ashley!
6705733 6707026 Melly!
6708903 6710237 Melly!
6714700 6716660 Rhett, Rhett!
6720122 6721457 Rhett, where are you?
6726003 6727421 Rhett, wait for me.
6732509 6733969 Rhett, wait for me!
6761288 6762456 Rhett.
6765625 6766710 Come in.
6774760 6775802 Rhett...
6776470 6778054 Melanie, she's...
6781766 6782934 Well, God rest her.
6783727 6786563 She was the only completely kind person<br />I ever knew.
6787606 6788899 A great lady.
6789357 6790567 A very great lady.
6793403 6796781 So she's dead.<br />That makes it nice for you, doesn't it?
6797782 6801494 Oh, how can you say such a thing?<br />You know how I loved her, really!
6802829 6804330 No, I don't know that I do.
6804873 6808084 But at least it's to your credit<br />that you could appreciate her at the end.
6808168 6811463 Of course I appreciated her.<br />She thought of everybody except herself.
6812755 6814591 Why her last words were about you.
6815800 6816926 What did she say?
6817260 6818428 She said:
6818803 6821347 "Be kind to Captain Butler.<br />He loves you so."
6827562 6828730 Did she say anything else?
6828813 6830273 She said...
6830857 6833234 ...she asked me to look after Ashley, too.
6835653 6838740 It's convenient to have<br />the first wife's permission, isn't it?
6841117 6842285 What do you mean?
6845163 6846330 What are you doing?
6846873 6848416 I'm leaving you, my dear.
6848791 6852420 All you need now is a divorce,<br />and your dreams of Ashley can come true.
6855715 6857300 Oh, no!
6858009 6860261 No, you're wrong! Terribly wrong!
6860511 6863639 I don't want a divorce.<br />Oh, Rhett, when I knew tonight...
6863723 6866309 ...when I knew I loved you,<br />I ran home to tell you.
6866350 6868269 Oh, darling, darling...
6868436 6870021 Please don't go on with this.
6870104 6873733 Leave us some dignity to remember<br />out of our marriage. Spare us this last.
6873816 6874942 This last?
6875317 6876861 Oh, Rhett, do listen to me.
6877069 6880948 I must have loved you for years, only I was<br />such a stupid fool I didn't know it.
6881031 6883367 Please believe me. You must care.
6883868 6885161 Melly said you did.
6885786 6888330 I believe you. What about Ashley Wilkes?
6889457 6891208 I never really loved Ashley.
6892251 6895504 You certainly gave a good imitation of it,<br />up till this morning.
6896797 6899008 No, Scarlett. I tried everything.
6899550 6902428 If you'd only met me half way,<br />even when I came back from London.
6902511 6906181 I was so glad to see you.<br />I was, Rhett, but you were so nasty.
6906265 6909018 And then, when you were sick<br />and it was all my fault...
6909560 6912396 ...I hoped against hope<br />that you'd call for me, but you didn't.
6912479 6916775 I wanted you. I wanted you desperately,<br />but I didn't think you wanted me.
6918152 6922197 It seems we've been at cross purposes,<br />doesn't it? But it's no use now.
6923323 6926452 As long as there was Bonnie,<br />there was a chance we might be happy.
6927035 6928745 I liked to think that Bonnie was you.
6928829 6932374 A little girl again, before the war,<br />and poverty had done things to you.
6933250 6937796 She was so like you, and I could pet her,<br />and spoil her, as I wanted to spoil you.
6939923 6942050 But when she went, she took everything.
6942342 6943385 Oh, Rhett!
6943969 6945804 Rhett, please don't say that.
6945887 6948598 I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry for everything.
6950809 6952519 My darling, you're such a child.
6953395 6957065 You think that by saying, "I'm sorry,"<br />all the past can be corrected.
6960110 6962028 Here, take my handkerchief.
6962654 6966241 Never, at any crisis of your life,<br />have I known you to have a handkerchief.
6972038 6973874 Rhett, where are you going?
6973999 6976084 I'm going to Charleston.<br />Back where I belong.
6976126 6978128 Please. Please take me with you.
6979129 6981673 No. I'm through with everything here.
6982465 6984009 I want peace.
6984217 6988138 I want to see if somewhere there isn't<br />something left in life of charm and grace.
6989264 6992767 - Do you know what I'm talking about?<br />- No. I only know that I love you.
6993685 6995270 That's your misfortune.
6995520 6996563 Oh, Rhett.
7001818 7002777 Rhett!
7009242 7010326 Rhett!
7010493 7013454 If you go, where shall I go?<br />What shall I do?
7014497 7016708 Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
7030722 7033182 Oh, I can't let him go! I can't!
7034058 7036644 There must be some way<br />to bring him back.
7039355 7042525 I can't think about it now.<br />I'll go crazy if I do!
7044402 7046320 I'll think about it tomorrow.
7060793 7062837 But I must think about it.
7063504 7065256 I must think about it.
7066882 7068342 What is there to do?
7069760 7071595 What is there that matters?
7074765 7076976 Do you mean to tell me,<br />Katie Scarlett O'Hara...
7077059 7081146 ...that Tara doesn't mean anything to you?<br />Why, land's the only thing that matters.
7081522 7083607 It's the only thing that lasts.
7083858 7087528 Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.
7087736 7091073 It's this from which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.
7091448 7095119 Why, land's the only thing that matters.<br />It's the only thing that lasts.
7095285 7098539 Something you love better than me,<br />though you may not know it. Tara.
7098622 7101500 This from which you get your strength.<br />The red earth of Tara.
7101583 7103252 Why, land's the only thing that matters.
7103293 7104670 Something you love better than me.
7104753 7105963 The red earth of Tara.
7106046 7107673 - Tara!<br />- Tara!
7111093 7112136 Tara!
7113595 7114596 Home!
7115973 7116974 I'll go home!
7118475 7121103 And I'll think of some way to get him back.
7121770 7123105 After all...
7123689 7125899 ...tomorrow is another day.
