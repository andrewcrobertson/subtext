409027 411257 What do we care if we were expelled<br />from college?
411329 414321 The war is gonna start any day.<br />We would've left college anyhow.
414399 416060 War! Isn't it exciting, Scarlett?
416134 418193 You know those fool Yankees<br />actually want a war?
418269 420464 - We'll show them.<br />- Fiddle-dee-dee!
420538 421732 War, war, war.
421839 424831 This war talk's spoiling all the fun<br />at every party this spring.
424909 427207 I get so bored I could scream.
427545 430742 - Besides, there isn't going to be any war.<br />- Not gonna be any war?
430815 433215 Why, honey, of course<br />there's going to be a war!
433284 437311 If either of you says "war" just once again,<br />I'll go in the house and slam the door.
437388 440482 - But, Scarlett, honey...<br />- Don't you want us to have a war?
446397 447523 Well...
448800 450028 but remember...
450501 451729 I warned you.
452070 453503 I've got an idea.
453571 456039 We'll talk about the Wilkes' barbecue<br />at Twelve Oaks.
456107 458837 That's a good idea.<br />Aren't you eating barbecue with us?
458910 462038 I hadn't thought about that yet.<br />I'll think about that tomorrow.
462113 463307 We want all your waltzes.
463381 466043 First Brent, then me, then Brent,<br />then me again, and so on.
466117 468677 - Promise?<br />- I'd just love to.
469053 472545 If only I didn't have<br />every one of them taken already.
472623 474352 Why, honey, you can't do that to us.
474425 477019 - How about if we tell you a secret?<br />- A secret? Who about?
477095 479222 You know Miss Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta?
479297 481697 Ashley Wilkes' cousin.<br />She's visiting the Wilkes...
481766 484701 That goody-goody!<br />Who wants to know a secret about her?
484769 486396 Anyway, we heard, that is, they say...
486471 490498 Ashley Wilkes is gonna marry her.<br />The Wilkeses always marry their cousins.
490575 492270 Now do we get those waltzes?
492510 493841 Of course.
494746 498978 - The other boys will be hopping mad.<br />- Let them be mad. We can handle them!
499584 501814 It can't be true. Ashley loves me.
501886 503046 Scarlett!
503454 505081 What has gotten into her?
505156 506919 Do you suppose we made her mad?
506991 510825 Where are you going without your shawl,<br />and the night air fixing to set in?
510895 513557 How come you didn't ask them gentlemen<br />to stay for supper?
513631 515826 You ain't got no more manners<br />than a field hand...
515900 518095 after me and Miss Ellen done labored<br />with you.
518169 520569 Miss Scarlett, come on in the house!
520638 522936 Come on in before you catch<br />your death of dampness.
523007 525669 No! I'll wait for Pa to come home<br />from the Wilkes'.
525743 527335 Come on in here!
527912 529379 Come on!
544529 545860 Quitting time.
545930 547329 Who says it's quitting time?
547398 548558 I says it's quitting time.
548633 552034 I's the foreman. I's the one that says<br />when it's quitting time at Tara!
552103 553695 Quitting time!
554138 556072 Quitting time!
597014 600279 There's none in the county can touch you,<br />and none in the state.
601652 602676 Pa!
602987 605285 So proud of yourself you are.
607492 609357 Well, Katie Scarlett O'Hara.
609427 612863 So you've been spying on me,<br />and like your sister Suellen...
612930 615364 you'll tell your mother on me<br />that I was jumping again.
615433 618596 You know I'm no tattletale like Suellen,<br />but it does seem to me...
618669 621661 after you broke your knee last year<br />jumping that same fence...
621739 626073 I'll not have me own daughter telling me<br />what I shall jump and not jump.
626143 627667 It's my own neck, so it is.
627812 631680 All right, Pa, you jump what you please.<br />How are they all over at Twelve Oaks?
631749 632773 The Wilkeses?
632850 636946 Just as you'd expect with the barbecue<br />tomorrow and talking nothing but war.
637021 639785 Oh, bother the war.<br />Was there anyone else there?
639857 643224 Their cousin, Melanie Hamilton<br />from Atlanta, and her brother, Charles.
643294 644556 Melanie Hamilton!
644629 646961 She's a pale-faced, mealy-mouthed ninny.<br />I hate her.
647031 648521 Ashley Wilkes doesn't think so.
648599 651625 Ashley Wilkes couldn't like<br />anyone like her.
652136 654570 What's your interest in Ashley<br />and Miss Melanie?
655840 658035 It's nothing. Let's go into the house, Pa.
658109 661272 Has he been trifling with you?<br />Has he asked you to marry him?
661345 662778 - No!<br />- No, nor will he.
662847 666078 I have it in strictest confidence<br />from John Wilkes this afternoon...
666150 667845 Ashley is going to marry Miss Melanie.
667919 670479 It will be announced tomorrow night<br />at the ball.
671055 672545 I don't believe it.
672723 674850 Here! Here, where are you off to?
675092 676081 Scarlett!
677028 678859 What are you about?
679297 682061 Have you made a spectacle of yourself<br />running after a man...
682133 685364 who's not in love with you when<br />you might have any man in the county?
685436 688837 I haven't been running after him.<br />It's just a surprise, that's all.
688906 691739 Now, don't be jerking your chin at me.
691809 695301 If Ashley wanted to marry you,<br />it would be with misgivings I'd say "yes. "
695379 698871 I want my girl to be happy.<br />You'd not be happy with him.
698983 700211 I would, I would!
700284 702252 What difference does it make<br />who you marry...
702320 704788 so long as he's a Southerner<br />and thinks like you?
704855 707085 And when I'm gone, I'll leave Tara to you.
707158 709752 I don't want Tara.<br />Plantations don't mean anything when...
709827 714389 You mean to say, Katie Scarlett O'Hara,<br />that land doesn't mean anything to you?
714465 717332 Why, land is the only thing in the world<br />worth working for...
717401 721201 worth fighting for, worth dying for,<br />because it's the only thing that lasts.
721272 724799 - Oh, Pa, you talk like an Irishman.<br />- It's proud I am that I'm Irish.
724875 728436 And don't you be forgetting, missy,<br />that you're half Irish too.
728512 730912 And to anyone with a drop of Irish blood<br />in them...
730982 733212 why, the land they live on<br />is like their mother.
733284 737846 Oh, but you're just a child.<br />It'll come to you, this love of the land.
737922 740288 There's no getting away from it<br />if you're Irish.
765216 766240 Yonder she comes!
766317 769115 Miss Scarlett, Miss Suellen, Miss Carreen,<br />your ma's home!
769186 772087 Acting like a wet nurse<br />to them low-down, poor white trash...
772156 775648 instead of being here eating her supper.<br />Cookie, stir up the fire!
775726 778217 Miss Ellen's got no business<br />wearing herself out.
778763 781231 Take the lamp out on the porch.<br />Wearing herself out.
781298 783391 Mr. Gerald, Miss Ellen's home.
783467 785799 Wearing herself out<br />waiting on poor white trash.
785870 787963 Shut up, dog!<br />Barking in the house like that.
788039 790735 Get up from there, boy.<br />Don't you hear Miss Ellen's coming?
790808 793140 Get out there and get her medicine chest.
793511 795809 We was getting worried about you,<br />Miss Ellen.
795880 798508 - Mr. Gerald...<br />- All right, Pork. I'm home.
798949 802612 Mrs. O'Hara, we finished plowing<br />the creek bottom today.
802687 805281 What do you want me<br />to start on tomorrow?
805356 809087 Mr. Wilkerson, I've just come<br />from Emmie Slattery's bedside.
809226 810784 Your child has been born.
810895 814126 My child, ma'am?<br />I'm sure I don't understand.
814298 816630 Has been born, and mercifully, has died.
817501 819162 Good night, Mr. Wilkerson.
822540 824940 I'll fix your supper for you myself,<br />and you eats it.
825009 826135 After prayers, Mammy.
826210 827336 Yes, ma'am.
828546 829877 Mr. O'Hara.
830448 832075 You must dismiss Jonas Wilkerson.
832149 835710 Dismiss him, Mrs. O'Hara?<br />He's the best overseer in the county.
835786 837845 He must go tomorrow morning, first thing.
837922 839014 But...
840491 841583 - No!<br />- Yes.
842993 845723 The Yankee Wilkerson<br />and the white trash Slattery girl?
845796 847764 We'll discuss it later, Mr. O'Hara.
847865 848957 Yes, Mrs. O'Hara.
854739 856434 I want to wear Scarlett's green dress!
856507 859203 I don't like your tone, Suellen.<br />Your pink gown is lovely.
859276 862973 - Can't I stay up for the ball tomorrow?<br />- But you may wear my garnets with it.
863047 865572 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
865649 867310 Scarlett...
867384 869944 you look tired, my dear.<br />I'm worried about you.
870855 872186 I'm all right, Mother.
872289 874519 Why can't I stay up for the ball<br />tomorrow night?
874592 875684 I'm 13 now.
875760 878456 You may go to the barbecue<br />and stay up till supper.
878529 880827 I didn't want to wear<br />your tacky green dress anyhow.
880898 881922 Oh, hush up!
881999 883489 Prayers, girls.
890174 895077 "And to all the saints, that I have sinned<br />exceedingly in thought, word and deed...
895446 896743 "through my fault.
896947 900110 "Through my fault,<br />through my most grievous fault.
900584 903917 "Therefore, I beseech the Blessed Mary,<br />ever Virgin...
904054 906318 "Blessed Michael, the Archangel...
906490 908390 "Blessed John the Baptist...
908459 910723 "the Holy Apostles, Peter and Paul...
911395 914387 "and all the saints<br />to pray to the Lord, our God, for me. "
914498 916557 Ashley doesn't know I love him.
917768 921431 I'll tell him that I love him<br />and then he can't marry her.
922706 925732 "May the Almighty,<br />and most merciful Lord...
925810 927573 "grant us pardon, absolution...
928212 929736 "and remission of our sins. Amen. "
932449 935009 Just hold on and suck in.
935853 938117 Mammy, here's Miss Scarlett's vittles.
938355 940789 You can take that back. I won't eat a bite.
940858 942450 Oh, yes, ma'am, you is!
942560 944824 You's gonna eat every mouthful of this.
945896 947921 No, I'm not!
950668 952727 Put on the dress, 'cause we're late already.
952803 954703 - What's my lamb gonna wear?<br />- That.
954772 958799 No you ain't! You can't show your bosom<br />before 3:00.
958943 960843 I'm gonna speak to your ma about you!
960911 964278 If you say one word to Mother,<br />I won't eat a bite.
968319 969343 Well...
976026 979325 Keep your shawl on.<br />I ain't aiming for you to get all freckled...
979396 983526 after the buttermilk I done put on you<br />all this winter, bleaching them freckles.
989807 993743 Now, Miss Scarlett, you come on<br />and be good, and eat just a little, honey.
993811 994869 No.
995179 998979 I'm going to have a good time today<br />and do my eating at the barbecue.
999149 1001982 If you don't care what folks says<br />about this family, I does!
1002052 1005317 I has told you and told you<br />that you can always tell a lady...
1005389 1007516 by the way she eats with folks. Like a bird.
1007591 1009718 I ain't aiming for you to go to Mr. Wilkes'...
1009793 1012023 and eat like a field hand<br />and gobble like a hog!
1012096 1013427 Fiddle-dee-dee.
1013831 1017164 Ashley Wilkes told me he likes to see a girl<br />with a healthy appetite.
1017234 1020226 What gentlemen says and<br />what they thinks is two different things.
1020304 1023296 And I ain't noticed Mr. Ashley<br />asking to marry you!
1039423 1043359 Now don't eat too fast. Ain't no need<br />of having it come right back up again.
1045896 1048831 Why does a girl have to be so silly<br />to catch a husband?
1049066 1053935 Scarlett, if you're not here by the time<br />I count ten, we'll be going without you!
1054171 1055399 I'm coming, Pa!
1055539 1056597 One...
1056674 1058301 two, three...
1059009 1061068 four, five, six...
1062046 1063172 Oh, dear!
1063447 1067178 My stays are so tight I know I'll never<br />get through the day without belching.
1092076 1095773 Well, John Wilkes. It's a grand day<br />you'll be having for the barbecue.
1095846 1098781 So it seems, Gerald.<br />But why isn't Mrs. O'Hara with you?
1098849 1100976 She's after settling accounts<br />with the overseer.
1101085 1102916 But she'll be along for the ball tonight.
1102987 1104818 Welcome to Twelve Oaks, Mr. O'Hara.
1104888 1106913 Thank you kindly, India.
1106991 1109687 Your daughter's getting prettier every day,<br />John.
1110227 1113025 India, here are the O'Hara girls.<br />We must greet them.
1113097 1116533 I can't stand Scarlett. If you see<br />the way she throws herself at Ashley.
1116600 1118625 Now, that's your brother's business.
1118702 1121330 You must remember your duties<br />as hostess.
1121405 1123635 Good morning, girls. You're looking lovely.
1124208 1125835 Good morning, Scarlett.
1126410 1128901 Why, India Wilkes, what a lovely dress!
1129113 1132344 - Perfectly lovely, darling.<br />- I just can't take my eyes off it.
1134284 1135342 Scarlett, honey...
1135419 1137410 You're looking mighty fine this morning.
1137488 1139786 - Good morning, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Good morning.
1140391 1142416 - It's a pleasure to see you.<br />- Good morning.
1142493 1143721 Howdy, Miss Scarlett.
1145229 1146253 Ashley!
1148732 1150290 Scarlett, my dear.
1151869 1153996 I've been looking for you everywhere.
1154071 1156039 I've got something I must tell you.
1156206 1159698 - Can't we go some place where it's quiet?<br />- Yes, I'd like to, but I...
1159910 1161775 I have something to tell you, too.
1161845 1164609 Something I hope you'll be glad to hear.
1165616 1168016 But come say hello<br />to my cousin Melanie, first.
1168085 1169677 Oh, do we have to?
1169987 1172820 She's been looking forward<br />to seeing you again.
1172923 1173947 Melanie!
1175159 1176683 Here's Scarlett.
1177127 1178116 Scarlett!
1179630 1181257 I'm so glad to see you again.
1181331 1184323 Melanie Hamilton!<br />What a surprise to run into you here.
1184601 1186694 I hope you'll stay with us<br />a few days at least.
1186770 1190228 I hope I shall stay long enough for us<br />to become real friends, Scarlett.
1190307 1191638 I do so want us to be.
1191708 1193505 We'll keep her here, won't we, Scarlett?
1193577 1196011 We'll just have to make<br />the biggest fuss over her.
1196080 1199311 If there's anybody knows how to give<br />a girl a good time, it's Ashley.
1199383 1203217 Though I expect our good times will seem<br />silly to you because you're so serious.
1203287 1205847 Oh, Scarlett, you have so much life.
1205923 1207413 I've always admired you so.
1207491 1209118 I wish I could be more like you.
1209193 1212128 You mustn't flatter me, Melanie,<br />and say things you don't mean.
1212196 1215597 Nobody could accuse Melanie<br />of being insincere. Could they, my dear?
1216200 1218259 Then she's not like you, is she, Ashley?
1218335 1220735 Ashley never means a word he says<br />to any girl.
1221305 1224797 Oh, why, Charles Hamilton,<br />you handsome old thing, you!
1224875 1226342 But, oh, Miss O'Hara, I...
1226410 1228844 Was it kind to bring<br />your good-looking brother here...
1228912 1231403 just to break my poor, simple,<br />country girl's heart?
1231482 1233450 She never even noticed Charles before.
1233517 1235985 Because he's your beau,<br />she's after him like a hornet.
1236053 1238521 Charles Hamilton,<br />I want to eat barbecue with you.
1238589 1242389 Mind you, don't go philandering with<br />any other girl, 'cause I'm mighty jealous.
1242459 1243858 I won't, Miss O'Hara!
1244328 1245590 I couldn't!
1246096 1248792 I do declare, Frank Kennedy,<br />if you don't look dashing...
1248866 1250197 with that new set of whiskers!
1250267 1252758 Oh, thank you, Miss Scarlett.
1253203 1255933 Charles and Rafe asked me<br />to eat barbecue with them...
1256006 1258270 but I told them I couldn't<br />because I promised you.
1258342 1261937 You needn't be so amused. Look at her!<br />She's after your beau now!
1262346 1265144 Oh, that's mighty flattering of you,<br />Miss Scarlett.
1265682 1267673 I'll see what I can do, Miss Scarlett.
1267885 1270445 What's your sister so mad about?<br />You sparking her beau?
1270521 1273581 As if I couldn't get a better beau<br />than that old maid in britches.
1273657 1277184 Brent and Stuart Tarleton, you handsome<br />old things, you! No, you're not!
1277261 1278785 I won't say that. I'm mad at you!
1278862 1279851 What have we done?
1279930 1282364 You haven't been near me all day.<br />I wore this dress...
1282432 1283660 'cause I thought you liked it.
1283734 1285793 I was counting on eating barbecue<br />with you two.
1285869 1288064 - Well, you are, Scarlett.<br />- Of course you are.
1288138 1292074 Oh, I never can make up my mind<br />which of you two is the handsomer.
1292409 1295572 I was awake all last night<br />trying to figure it out.
1301151 1302880 Cathleen, who's that?
1302953 1303977 Who?
1304054 1306079 That man looking at us and smiling.
1306456 1307650 The nasty, dark one.
1307758 1311785 My dear, don't you know?<br />That's Rhett Butler. He's from Charleston.
1311862 1313989 He has the most terrible reputation.
1318835 1322066 He looks as if he knows<br />what I look like without my shimmy!
1322139 1323197 Scarlett!
1323574 1325371 Why, my dear, he isn't received!
1325642 1327200 He spends a lot of time up North...
1327277 1329905 because his folks in Charleston<br />won't even speak to him.
1329980 1332312 He was expelled from West Point,<br />he's so fast.
1332382 1335647 And then there's that business<br />about that girl he wouldn't marry.
1335719 1336743 Tell, tell!
1336920 1341152 Well, he took her out buggy riding<br />in the late afternoon without a chaperon!
1341725 1344216 And then he refused to marry her!
1347831 1350425 No, but she was ruined just the same.
1356173 1357697 Ashley!
1357874 1358966 Happy?
1359076 1360065 So happy!
1361812 1363939 You seem to belong here...
1364381 1366815 as if it had all been imagined for you.
1368218 1370618 I like to feel that I belong<br />to the things you love.
1370687 1372279 You love Twelve Oaks as I do.
1372356 1373414 Yes, Ashley.
1373824 1375314 I love it as...
1375392 1376916 as more than a house.
1377561 1381554 It's a whole world that wants only<br />to be graceful and beautiful.
1381698 1383859 It's so unaware that it may not last...
1384601 1385693 forever.
1385769 1389034 You're afraid of what may happen<br />if the war comes, aren't you?
1389172 1391766 But we don't have to be afraid for us.
1392342 1394810 No war can come into our world, Ashley.
1395812 1397109 Whatever comes...
1397814 1400544 I'll love you, just as I do now...
1401318 1402444 until I die.
1407424 1409289 Isn't this better than sitting at a table?
1409359 1411827 A girl hasn't got but two sides to her<br />at a table.
1413230 1414322 I'll go get her dessert.
1414398 1416798 - Here, she said me.<br />- Allow me, Miss O'Hara.
1419036 1420230 I think...
1423540 1426338 I think Charles Hamilton may get it.
1427944 1429605 Oh, thank you, Miss O'Hara!
1430147 1431375 Thank you.
1431615 1432741 Go get it.
1432916 1435043 Isn't he the luckiest?
1442359 1443383 Miss O'Hara...
1444928 1445917 I love you.
1447531 1449931 I don't guess I'm as hungry as I thought.
1453337 1456135 Why do I have to take a nap? I'm not tired.
1456406 1458738 Well-brought-up young ladies<br />take naps at parties.
1458809 1462768 It's high time you started behaving and<br />acting like you was Miss Ellen's daughter.
1462846 1466247 When we were at Saratoga I didn't notice<br />any Yankee girls taking naps.
1466316 1470184 No, and you ain't gonna see<br />no Yankee girls at the ball tonight, neither.
1470354 1471946 How was Ashley today, Scarlett?
1472022 1474616 He didn't seem to be paying<br />much attention to you.
1474691 1476386 You mind your own business!
1476460 1478860 You'll be lucky not to lose<br />old whisker-face Kennedy.
1478929 1480362 You've liked Ashley for months!
1480430 1483058 Pa said that his engagement's<br />gonna be announced tonight.
1483133 1484498 That's all you know.
1485001 1487526 Miss Scarlett! Miss Suellen!<br />You all behave yourselves.
1487604 1489299 Acting like poor white trash children!
1489373 1492865 If you's old enough to go to parties,<br />you's old enough to act like ladies.
1492943 1494069 Who cares!
1545262 1547787 We've borne enough insults<br />from the meddling Yankees.
1547864 1550526 It's time we made them understand<br />we'll keep our slaves...
1550600 1551931 with or without their approval.
1552002 1555403 'Twas Georgia's sovereign right<br />to secede from the Union!
1555472 1556461 That's right!
1556540 1559031 The South must assert herself<br />by force of arms.
1559109 1563273 After we've fired on the Yankee rascals<br />at Fort Sumter, we've got to fight!
1563447 1565813 - There's no other way!<br />- Fight! That's right. Fight!
1565882 1567611 Let the Yankees ask for peace!
1567684 1571313 The situation is very simple.<br />The Yankees can't fight and we can.
1572355 1573788 There won't even be a battle.
1573857 1575484 They'll just turn and run every time.
1575559 1577356 One Southerner can lick 20 Yankees.
1577427 1579258 We'll finish them in one battle.
1579329 1581354 Gentlemen can always fight better<br />than rabble.
1581431 1583831 Yes, gentlemen always can fight better<br />than rabble.
1583900 1586061 What does the captain of our troop say?
1586236 1589672 Well, gentlemen, if Georgia fights,<br />I go with her.
1590106 1593769 But, like my father, I hope the Yankees<br />will let us leave the Union in peace.
1593844 1596108 - But, Ashley...<br />- But, Ashley, they've insulted us!
1596179 1597646 You can't mean you don't want war!
1597714 1601150 Most of the miseries of the world<br />were caused by wars.
1601251 1605244 And when the wars were over<br />no one ever knew what they were about.
1605322 1606789 If it wasn't that I knew you...
1606857 1610884 Now, gentlemen, Mr. Butler's been<br />up North, I hear.
1611027 1613086 Don't you agree with us, Mr. Butler?
1613630 1616190 I think it's hard winning a war with words,<br />gentlemen.
1616266 1617665 What do you mean, sir?
1617801 1620565 There's not a cannon factory<br />in the whole South.
1620637 1622662 What difference does that make<br />to a gentleman?
1622739 1626004 Lt'll make a great deal of difference<br />to a great many gentlemen, sir.
1626076 1628840 Are you hinting, Mr. Butler,<br />that the Yankees can lick us?
1628912 1629970 No, I'm not hinting.
1630046 1633277 I'm saying very plainly that the Yankees<br />are better equipped than we.
1633350 1635614 They've got factories, shipyards,<br />coal mines...
1635685 1638518 and a fleet to bottle up our harbors<br />and starve us to death.
1638588 1641921 All we've got is cotton and slaves<br />and arrogance.
1641992 1645519 - That's treacherous!<br />- I refuse to listen to any renegade talk!
1645762 1647286 I'm sorry if the truth offends you.
1647364 1649662 Apologies aren't enough, sir!
1649733 1652634 I hear you were turned out of West Point,<br />Mr. Rhett Butler...
1652702 1656934 and you aren't received by any decent<br />family in Charleston, not even your own!
1661378 1664347 I apologize again for all my shortcomings.
1665982 1669008 Perhaps you won't mind if I walk about<br />and look over your place.
1669085 1672384 I seem to be spoiling<br />everybody's brandy and cigars and...
1672656 1673918 dreams of victory.
1681131 1684658 That's just about what you could expect<br />from somebody like Rhett Butler.
1684734 1686531 You did everything but call him out.
1686603 1687763 He refused to fight.
1687837 1690635 Not quite that, Charles.<br />He refused to take advantage of you.
1690707 1691731 Take advantage of me?
1691808 1695266 He's one of the best shots in the country,<br />as he's proved several times...
1695345 1697142 against steadier hands and cooler heads.
1697213 1698407 - I'll show him!<br />- No, please.
1698481 1701006 Don't go tweaking his nose anymore.
1701084 1703917 You may be needed<br />for more important fighting, Charles.
1704220 1706654 Now, if you'll excuse me,<br />Mr. Butler is our guest.
1706723 1708816 I think I'll just show him around.
1721571 1722663 Ashley!
1730280 1731838 Ashley!
1732215 1733273 Scarlett.
1735151 1737346 Who are you hiding from in here?
1742626 1744321 What are you up to?
1746363 1749389 Well, why aren't you upstairs<br />resting with the other girls?
1750700 1752725 What is this, Scarlett? A secret?
1753136 1755502 Oh, Ashley, Ashley...
1756172 1757332 I love you.
1757641 1758665 Scarlett!
1758742 1760209 I love you, I do!
1762612 1766275 Well, isn't it enough that you've gathered<br />every other man's heart today?
1766349 1768749 You've always had mine.<br />You cut your teeth on it.
1768818 1770445 Oh, don't tease me now.
1770520 1773318 Have I your heart, my darling?<br />I love you, I love you.
1773390 1777019 You mustn't say such things.<br />You'll hate me for hearing them.
1777127 1781291 Oh, I could never hate you,<br />and I know you must care about me.
1781698 1783825 Oh, you do care, don't you?
1785068 1786194 Yes...
1786703 1787829 I care.
1789339 1792206 Oh, can't we go away and forget<br />we ever said these things?
1794044 1795705 But how can we do that?
1796046 1798276 Don't you want to marry me?
1798415 1799939 I'm going to marry Melanie.
1800083 1802449 But you can't. Not if you care for me.
1802619 1805747 Oh, my dear, why must you make me<br />say things that will hurt you?
1806656 1808715 How can I make you understand?
1809426 1810916 You're so young and unthinking.
1810994 1812518 You don't know what marriage means.
1812595 1815029 I know I love you<br />and I want to be your wife.
1815131 1816564 You don't love Melanie.
1816766 1818233 She's like me, Scarlett.
1818635 1821365 She's part of my blood<br />and we understand each other.
1821671 1823536 But you love me.
1823773 1825400 How could I help loving you?
1825909 1828309 You have all the passion for life that I lack.
1828378 1831074 That kind of love isn't enough<br />for a successful marriage...
1831147 1832808 for two people as different as we are.
1832882 1835976 Well, why don't you say it, you coward?<br />You're afraid to marry me.
1836052 1838612 You'd rather live with that fool<br />who can't speak except...
1838688 1842385 to say "yes" and "no" and raise a passel<br />of mealy-mouthed brats just like her.
1842459 1844222 You mustn't say such things<br />about Melanie.
1844294 1845659 Who are you to tell me I mustn't?
1845729 1848493 You led me on, you made me believe<br />you wanted to marry me.
1848565 1850897 Now, Scarlett, be fair.<br />I never, at any time...
1850967 1854494 You did, it's true you did!<br />I'll hate you till I die!
1855105 1858404 I can't think of anything bad enough<br />to call you.
1885401 1887266 Has the war started?
1887871 1891272 Sir, you should have made<br />your presence known.
1891574 1893735 In the middle of that beautiful love scene?
1893943 1896138 That wouldn't have been very tactful,<br />would it?
1896212 1898772 But don't worry,<br />your secret is safe with me.
1899315 1900475 Sir, you are no gentleman!
1900550 1902677 And you, miss, are no lady.
1903153 1904984 Don't think I hold that against you.
1905054 1906783 Ladies have never held any charm for me.
1906856 1909882 First you take a low, common advantage<br />of me, then you insult me.
1909959 1913395 I meant it as a compliment<br />and I hope to see more of you...
1913463 1916296 when you're free of the spell<br />of the elegant Mr. Wilkes.
1916366 1920632 He doesn't strike me as half good enough<br />for a girl of your... What was it?
1920870 1922337 Your "passion for living. "
1922539 1925167 How dare you!<br />You aren't fit to wipe his boots.
1926576 1929568 And you were going to hate him<br />for the rest of your life.
1932048 1936041 She certainly made a fool of herself<br />running after all the men at the barbecue.
1936119 1937780 That's not fair, India.
1937854 1940618 She's so attractive,<br />the men just naturally flock to her.
1940690 1942624 Oh, Melanie, you're just too good<br />to be true.
1942692 1945058 Didn't you see her<br />going after your brother Charles?
1945128 1947096 Yes, and she knows<br />Charles belongs to me.
1947163 1948790 Oh, you're wrong, India.
1948865 1951925 Scarlett's just high-spirited and vivacious.
1952302 1954964 Men may flirt with girls like that<br />but they don't marry them.
1955038 1957233 I think you're being very mean to her.
1965882 1968851 War! War's declared! War!
1980530 1981929 Miss O'Hara!
1984968 1986128 Miss O'Hara!
1986402 1989701 Mr. Lincoln has called for soldiers,<br />volunteers to fight against us.
1989772 1992366 Don't you men ever think<br />about anything important?
1992442 1994603 But it's war and everybody's going off<br />to enlist.
1994677 1996440 They're going right away. I'm going, too.
1996512 1997570 Everybody?
2001885 2004285 Oh, Miss O'Hara, will you be sorry?
2004520 2006147 To see us go, I mean.
2006823 2008757 I'll cry into my pillow every night.
2008892 2010883 Miss O'Hara, I told you I loved you.
2011060 2015463 You're the most beautiful girl in the world,<br />and the sweetest and the dearest.
2015598 2017896 I know I couldn't hope<br />that you could love me.
2017967 2021425 I'm so clumsy and stupid<br />and not nearly good enough for you.
2021504 2025372 But if you could think of marrying me,<br />I'd do anything in the world for you.
2025441 2026965 Just anything. I promise.
2027510 2028772 What did you say?
2028978 2031811 Miss O'Hara, I said, would you marry me?
2037453 2039421 Yes, Mr. Hamilton, I will.
2040089 2042353 You will? You'll marry me?<br />You'll wait for me?
2042792 2044123 I don't think I'd want to wait.
2044193 2046627 You mean you'll marry me before I go?
2047130 2049098 Oh, Miss O'Hara.
2049165 2050894 Scarlett...
2052502 2053992 When may I speak to your father?
2054070 2055128 The sooner the better.
2055204 2056762 I'll go now. I can't wait.
2056839 2058739 Will you excuse me, dear?
2063680 2065545 Mr. O'Hara, Mr. O'Hara.
2065615 2067708 It'll be a week at least<br />before they call on me.
2067784 2070912 Only a week, and then they'll take you<br />away from me.
2103920 2106548 Scarlett, I thought of you<br />at our wedding yesterday...
2106622 2109716 and I hoped that yours would be<br />as beautiful, and it was.
2110360 2111384 Was it?
2111794 2114228 Now we're really and truly sisters.
2114897 2116387 - Charles.<br />- Melanie.
2124307 2127435 Don't cry, darling.<br />The war will be over in a few weeks...
2127510 2129637 and I'll be coming back to you.
2173556 2174716 Miss Scarlett!
2175792 2178955 Well, I don't care.<br />I'm too young to be a widow.
2179328 2180625 Miss Scarlett!
2182198 2184826 Why, I'd just go around scaring people<br />in that thing.
2185868 2188530 You ain't supposed to be around people.<br />You's in mourning.
2188604 2190902 For what? I don't feel anything.
2191507 2194169 Why should I have to pretend<br />and pretend...
2194811 2196210 What is it?
2197080 2199207 Oh, baby...
2200483 2201814 What is it?
2201884 2203283 My life is over.
2203619 2206179 Nothing will ever happen to me anymore.
2208624 2209955 Oh, Mother.
2210026 2214520 I know you'll think I'm horrible,<br />but I just can't bear going around in black.
2214864 2217458 It's bad enough not being able<br />to go to any parties...
2217533 2219160 but looking this way, too.
2219235 2221135 I don't think you're at all horrible.
2221204 2225334 It's only natural to want to look young<br />and be young when you are young.
2225708 2227437 Oh, baby...
2228411 2230379 How would you like<br />to go visiting somewhere?
2230446 2231606 Savannah, perhaps?
2231681 2233740 What would I do in Savannah?
2233916 2235508 Well, Atlanta, then.
2235818 2237843 There's lots going on there.
2237920 2241014 And you could stay<br />with Melanie and her Aunt Pittypat.
2241791 2242951 Melanie.
2243459 2244551 Yes.
2245361 2246623 Yes, I could, couldn't I?
2246696 2249824 Oh, Mother, you're sweet to me,<br />sweeter than anybody in the world.
2249966 2251331 You'd like it, really?
2251834 2255099 All right then.<br />Now stop your crying and smile.
2256939 2258600 You can take Prissy with you.
2259175 2261541 Start packing Miss Scarlett's things,<br />Mammy.
2261878 2263778 I'll go write the necessary letters.
2266782 2267771 Atlanta!
2267850 2271217 Savannah would be better for you.<br />You'd just get in trouble in Atlanta.
2271287 2272811 What trouble are you talking about?
2272889 2276586 You know what trouble I's talking about.<br />I's talking about Mr. Ashley Wilkes.
2276659 2278786 He'll come to Atlanta<br />when he gets his leave...
2278861 2281386 and you're sitting there<br />waiting for him like a spider!
2281464 2284797 - He belongs to Miss Melanie...<br />- You go pack my things like Mother said.
2305821 2308585 They're all whispering,<br />and I just know it's about her.
2308658 2310649 What's it matter what they say,<br />Aunt Pittypat?
2310726 2315356 But Scarlett is living under my roof,<br />so they all think I'm responsible for her.
2315464 2319195 And for a widow to appear in public<br />at a social gathering!
2319268 2321896 Every time I think of it I feel faint!
2322071 2326303 Aunt Pitty, you know Scarlett came here<br />only to help raise money for the cause.
2326375 2329435 It was splendid of her<br />to make the sacrifice.
2329579 2331308 Anyone would think, to hear you talk...
2331380 2334872 that she came here to dance<br />instead of to sell things.
2347230 2348959 Ladies and gentlemen!
2349031 2351727 I have important news! Glorious news!
2352101 2355195 Another triumph<br />for our magnificent men in arms.
2355938 2359169 General Lee has completely<br />whipped the enemy...
2359242 2363235 and swept the Yankee Army<br />northward from Virginia.
2372355 2375483 And now, a happy surprise for all of us.
2375958 2380088 We have with us tonight that most daring<br />of all blockade-runners...
2380463 2384024 whose fleet schooners,<br />slipping past the Yankee guns...
2384100 2387934 have brought us here the very woolens<br />and laces we wear tonight.
2388137 2392198 I refer, ladies and gentlemen, to that<br />will-o'- the-wisp of the bounding main.
2392408 2395206 None other than our friend<br />from Charleston...
2395511 2397069 Capt. Rhett Butler!
2418034 2419433 Permit me.
2423739 2426936 Capt. Butler, it's such a pleasure<br />to see you again.
2427243 2429268 I met you last at my husband's home.
2429378 2431608 That's kind of you to remember,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2432014 2434642 Did you meet Capt. Butler<br />at Twelve Oaks, Scarlett?
2434717 2436810 Yes, I think so.
2437086 2439714 Only for a moment, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />It was in the library.
2439789 2441689 You had broken something.
2442792 2445226 Yes, Capt. Butler, I remember you.
2445294 2449321 Ladies, the Confederacy asks for<br />your jewelry on behalf of our noble cause.
2449398 2451457 We aren't wearing any. We're in mourning.
2451534 2452796 Wait.
2453402 2455768 On behalf of Mrs. Wilkes<br />and Mrs. Hamilton.
2456806 2458137 Thank you, Capt. Butler.
2458441 2460068 Just a moment, please.
2462878 2464903 But it's your wedding ring, ma'am.
2465314 2468613 It may help my husband more,<br />off my finger.
2469251 2470377 Thank you.
2472855 2475415 That's a very beautiful thing to do,<br />Mrs. Wilkes.
2475925 2476983 Here.
2477259 2479819 You can have mine, too, for the cause.
2482098 2485966 And you, Mrs. Hamilton.<br />I know just how much that means to you.
2486202 2487567 - Melanie!<br />- Yes, Dr. Meade.
2487636 2490036 I need your approval,<br />as a member of the Committee...
2490106 2492631 for something we want to do<br />that's rather shocking.
2493142 2495042 Will you excuse us, please?
2497179 2500842 I'll say one thing. The war makes<br />the most peculiar widows.
2501117 2502277 I wish you'd go away.
2502351 2505548 If you had any raising you'd know<br />I'd never want to see you again.
2508424 2509891 Now, why be silly?
2509959 2514123 You've no reason for hating me.<br />I'll carry your guilty secret to my grave.
2515831 2519426 I guess I'd be very unpatriotic<br />to hate one of the great heroes of the war.
2519502 2523268 I do declare I was surprised to see you<br />turn out to be such a noble character.
2523339 2526831 I can't bear to take advantage<br />of your little girl ideas, Miss O'Hara.
2526909 2528968 I'm neither noble nor heroic.
2529178 2530509 But you are a blockade-runner?
2530579 2532638 For profit, and profit only.
2532848 2535078 Are you telling me<br />you don't believe in the cause?
2535151 2537779 I believe in Rhett Butler.<br />He's the only cause I know.
2537853 2539184 The rest doesn't mean much to me.
2542792 2544760 And now, ladies and gentlemen...
2544860 2547829 I have a startling surprise<br />for the benefit of the hospital.
2549598 2553728 Gentlemen, if you wish to lead the opening<br />reel with the lady of your choice...
2554036 2555765 you must bid for her.
2557273 2560333 Caroline Meade, how can you permit<br />your husband to conduct this...
2560409 2562036 this slave auction?
2562111 2564671 Dolly Merriwether,<br />how dare you criticize me!
2565047 2566605 Melanie Wilkes told the doctor...
2566682 2569651 that if it's for the benefit of the cause,<br />it's quite all right.
2569718 2570912 She did!
2570986 2574012 Oh dear, oh dear.<br />Where are my smelling salts?
2574390 2575652 I think I shall faint.
2575724 2578056 Don't you dare faint, Pittypat Hamilton.
2578227 2580821 If Melanie says it's all right, it is all right.
2582064 2584862 Come, gentlemen, do I hear your bids?<br />Make your offers.
2585801 2587462 Don't be bashful, gentlemen.
2588270 2592172 $20. $20 for Miss Maybelle Merriwether.
2592308 2594503 $25 for Miss Fanny Elsing.
2594577 2596704 Only $25 to give your...
2596846 2598905 $150 in gold.
2599448 2600642 For what lady, sir?
2600749 2602717 For Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2605621 2606713 For whom, sir?
2607223 2608781 Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2608858 2611019 Mrs. Hamilton is in mourning,<br />Capt. Butler...
2611126 2613890 but I'm sure any of our Atlanta belles<br />would be proud to...
2613963 2617421 Dr. Meade, I said Mrs. Charles Hamilton.
2618234 2620429 She will not consider it, sir.
2620669 2622000 Oh, yes, I will.
2634250 2637151 Choose your partners for the Virginia reel.
2638554 2640579 We've sort of shocked the Confederacy.
2640656 2642590 It's a bit like blockade-running, isn't it?
2642658 2643647 It's worse.
2643726 2645660 But I expect a very fancy profit out of it.
2645728 2647855 I don't care what you expect<br />or what they think.
2647930 2649227 I'm going to dance and dance.
2649298 2652324 Tonight I wouldn't mind<br />dancing with Abe Lincoln himself.
2684166 2686760 Another dance and my reputation<br />will be lost forever.
2686835 2689235 With enough courage,<br />you can do without a reputation.
2689305 2690772 Oh, you do talk scandalous.
2699181 2701445 You do waltz divinely, Capt. Butler.
2701684 2705484 Don't start flirting with me.<br />I'm not one of your plantation beaux.
2705621 2707851 I want more than flirting from you.
2708390 2710017 What do you want?
2710459 2714828 I'll tell you, Scarlett O'Hara, if you'll take<br />that Southern belle simper off your face.
2715698 2717222 Some day I want you to say to me...
2717299 2720132 the words I heard you say<br />to Ashley Wilkes:
2720502 2721662 "I love you. "
2722204 2726436 That's something you'll never hear from<br />me, Capt. Butler, as long as you live.
2747029 2749224 How sweet, how kind.
2749298 2751266 He is a thoughtful gentleman.
2751333 2755064 Fiddle-dee-dee, why doesn't he say<br />something about my sacrifice?
2762978 2765071 Oh, the darling thing.
2765147 2767081 Oh, Rhett, it's lovely, lovely.
2767249 2770343 You didn't really bring it all the way<br />from Paris just for me.
2770419 2773877 Yes, I thought it was about time<br />I got you out of that fake mourning.
2774189 2777249 Next trip, I'll bring you some green silk<br />for a frock to match it.
2777326 2778350 Oh, Rhett.
2778761 2783698 It's my duty to our brave boys at the front<br />to keep our girls at home looking pretty.
2784400 2786834 Oh, it's so long<br />since I've had anything new.
2797546 2798604 How do I look?
2799915 2801746 Awful! Just awful.
2802084 2803346 Why, what's the matter?
2803452 2804976 This war has stopped being a joke...
2805054 2808319 when a girl like you doesn't know<br />how to wear the latest fashion.
2813362 2816024 Oh, Rhett, let me do it.
2821470 2824371 But, Rhett, I don't know<br />how I'd dare wear it.
2825240 2826366 You will, though.
2827209 2829700 And another thing. Those pantalets.
2829812 2832713 I don't know a woman in Paris<br />who wears pantalets anymore.
2832848 2833940 Oh, what do they...
2834516 2836643 You shouldn't talk about such things.
2836719 2837708 You little hypocrite.
2837786 2840311 You don't mind my knowing about them,<br />just my talking.
2840389 2844223 I really can't go on accepting these gifts,<br />though you are awfully kind.
2844293 2846227 I'm not kind. I'm just tempting you.
2846295 2850163 I never give anything without expecting<br />something in return. I always get paid.
2850232 2852928 If you think I'll marry you to pay<br />for the bonnet, I won't.
2853001 2855367 Don't flatter yourself.<br />I'm not a marrying man.
2855971 2858667 Well, I won't kiss you for it, either.
2869017 2870780 Open your eyes and look at me.
2872221 2874155 No, I don't think I will kiss you...
2874223 2875918 although you need kissing badly.
2875991 2877322 That's what's wrong with you.
2877392 2880327 You should be kissed, and often.<br />And by someone who knows how.
2880395 2883057 Oh, and I suppose you think<br />you're the proper person.
2883132 2885930 I might be, if the right moment ever came.
2886435 2889131 You're a conceited, black-hearted varmint,<br />Rhett Butler.
2889204 2891934 And I don't know why<br />I let you come and see me.
2892274 2893901 I'll tell you why, Scarlett.
2893976 2896171 Because I'm the only man over 16<br />and under 60...
2896245 2898543 who's around to show you a good time.
2898614 2901174 But cheer up,<br />the war can't last much longer.
2901316 2902783 Really, Rhett? Why?
2902851 2906480 There's a battle going on right now<br />that ought to pretty well fix things...
2906555 2907613 one way or the other.
2907689 2909589 Oh, Rhett. Is Ashley in it?
2911093 2914460 You haven't gotten the wooden-headed<br />Mr. Wilkes out of your mind.
2914530 2915861 Yes, I suppose he's in it.
2915931 2917922 Oh, but tell me, Rhett, where is it?
2918233 2921396 Some little town in Pennsylvania<br />called Gettysburg.
2950866 2952834 Casualty list.
3002851 3003943 Here you is, Miss Melanie.
3004019 3006715 They was fighting for them,<br />so it just got tore in half.
3006989 3009787 Scarlett, you look. The "W's" at the end.
3013695 3017062 "Wellman, Wendell, White,<br />Whitner, Wilkins...
3017733 3018927 "Williams, Woolsey, Workman. "
3019001 3021265 Scarlett, you've passed him.
3021870 3023701 Oh, he isn't there!
3023772 3024761 He isn't there!
3024840 3027035 Ashley's safe. He isn't listed.
3027109 3029270 Oh, he's safe, he's safe.
3031113 3035106 Oh, Scarlett, you're so sweet<br />to worry about Ashley like this for me.
3042557 3043990 I must go to her.
3045460 3047291 Don't, my dear, not here.
3048263 3049525 Let's go home.
3051033 3052728 Dr. Meade, not...
3052801 3055463 Yes, our boy, Darcy.
3056238 3058934 I was making these mittens for him.
3059541 3061372 He won't need them now.
3062244 3065839 Mother, I'm going to enlist! I'll show them.<br />I'll kill all those Yankees.
3065914 3067279 Phil Meade, you hush your mouth.
3067349 3070512 You think it'll help your mother<br />to have you off getting shot, too?
3070585 3072143 I never heard of anything so silly.
3074723 3077851 It's a black day, Scarlett.<br />You haven't had bad news, have you?
3077993 3079153 Ashley's safe.
3079227 3080922 I'm glad, for Mrs. Wilkes' sake.
3080996 3082588 Rhett, there are so many others.
3082664 3083688 Any of your friends?
3083765 3087496 Just about every family in the county.<br />The Tarleton boys, Rhett, both of them.
3087569 3091266 Yes, look at them.<br />All these poor tragic people.
3092107 3095634 The South's sinking to its knees.<br />It'll never rise again.
3096411 3097742 The cause...
3098046 3101174 The cause of living in the past<br />is dying right in front of us.
3101350 3103318 I never heard you talk like that before.
3103385 3107549 I'm angry. Waste always makes me angry.<br />And that's what all this is, sheer waste.
3109758 3111282 But don't you be downcast.
3111593 3115029 Ashley Wilkes is still alive to come home<br />to the women who love him...
3115364 3116763 both of them.
3153502 3155026 Oh, you're here.
3158440 3161409 Oh, you're here. You're really here at last.
3161710 3163905 Oh, my dear, I've waited so long.
3164112 3166512 Melanie, my dear, my darling wife.
3170452 3172511 Oh, but we're forgetting Scarlett.
3174022 3175319 Scarlett, dear.
3177759 3181525 Well, is this any way to greet<br />a returning warrior?
3181863 3183387 Ashley, I...
3186568 3188536 Merry Christmas, Ashley.
3196812 3200612 Come on, old gentleman, come on.<br />We've got all your wives.
3201383 3203283 We've got all your little chicks.
3203351 3206479 You got nobody to worry your head<br />about leaving.
3206888 3207946 Come on.
3208323 3212726 Now you just stand still so you can be<br />a Christmas gift for the white folks.
3213195 3214526 Now hold on.
3214930 3215988 Hold on!
3216731 3218756 Don't go getting so uppity...
3218834 3221234 even if you is the last chicken in Atlanta.
3223605 3225937 Let's not talk about the war.<br />It's Christmas.
3226241 3229938 Let's talk about Twelve Oaks, and Tara,<br />and all the times before the war.
3230011 3231535 Can we have the wine, Aunt Pittypat?
3231613 3234013 Why did you say there wasn't enough,<br />Uncle Peter?
3234082 3237609 There's plenty. It's the very last<br />of my father's fine Madeira.
3237819 3241721 He got it from his uncle,<br />Admiral Will Hamilton of Savannah...
3241823 3245156 who married his cousin,<br />Jessica Carroll of Carrollton...
3245360 3248989 who was his second cousin once removed<br />and a kin to the Wilkeses, too.
3249097 3252498 I saved it to wish Ashley<br />a Merry Christmas.
3253268 3256965 But you mustn't drink it all at once<br />because it is the last.
3261776 3264540 I meant it, my dear.<br />It was a lovely Christmas gift.
3264913 3267279 Only generals have tunics like this<br />nowadays.
3267349 3269112 I'm so happy you like it, dear.
3269184 3270981 Where did you get the cloth?
3271052 3273179 It was sent to me by a Charleston lady.
3273255 3277885 I nursed her son while he was in<br />the hospital, Ashley, before he died and...
3277959 3280587 Oh, you will take good care of it,<br />won't you?
3280662 3282755 You won't let it get torn.
3283198 3284256 Promise me.
3284332 3285492 You mustn't worry.
3286001 3289402 I'll bring it back to you<br />without any holes in it, I promise.
3292407 3293431 Good night, my dear.
3293508 3295772 Good night, Scarlett, darling.
3308690 3311090 Is it time yet, Uncle Peter,<br />for Mr. Ashley to leave?
3311159 3313024 Pretty quick now, Miss Scarlett.
3313094 3316552 She isn't going to the depot with him?<br />She hasn't changed her mind?
3316631 3318360 No, ma'am. She's laying down.
3318433 3322665 She's so upset Mr. Wilkes told her<br />she can't even come downstairs.
3328843 3329935 Ashley!
3334182 3336946 Ashley, let me go to the depot with you.
3337452 3340615 Oh, Scarlett, I'd rather remember you<br />as you are now...
3340689 3342589 not shivering at the depot.
3342657 3343851 All right.
3344859 3347828 Oh, Ashley, I've got a present for you, too.
3354903 3357167 Why, Scarlett, it's beautiful.
3357505 3359370 Tie it on me, my dear.
3360575 3364443 While Melly was making your new tunic,<br />I made this to go with it.
3365046 3366843 You made it yourself?
3367349 3370182 Well, then I shall value it all the more.
3370385 3373445 You know there's nothing<br />I wouldn't do for you.
3374422 3376219 There's something you can do for me.
3376291 3377656 What is it?
3377892 3380452 Will you look after Melanie for me?
3381029 3384396 She's so frail and gentle<br />and she loves you so much.
3384466 3385990 You see, if I were killed and she...
3386067 3389901 Oh, you mustn't say that. It's bad luck.<br />Say a prayer quickly.
3389971 3391370 You say one for me.
3392540 3395907 We shall need all our prayers<br />now the end is coming.
3396111 3397100 The end?
3397178 3398941 The end of the war.
3399581 3402106 And the end of our world, Scarlett.
3402384 3405683 But, Ashley, you don't think<br />the Yankees are beating us?
3405754 3408723 Scarlett, my men are barefooted now...
3409824 3412224 and the snow in Virginia is deep.
3412827 3414522 When I see them...
3414663 3418997 and I see the Yankees coming<br />and coming, always more and more...
3422003 3425166 Well, when the end does come<br />I shall be far away.
3425707 3428938 It'll be a comfort to me to know<br />that she has you.
3429311 3431438 You will promise, won't you?
3434049 3435107 Yes.
3436384 3438215 Is that all, Ashley?
3439020 3441750 All except goodbye.
3442290 3444349 Oh, Ashley, I can't let you go.
3444426 3445586 - You must be brave...<br />- No...
3445660 3446957 You must.
3447262 3449253 How else can I bear going?
3450298 3453927 Oh, Scarlett, you are so fine<br />and strong and beautiful.
3455136 3457661 Not just your sweet face, my dear...
3458039 3459404 but you.
3462844 3465039 Ashley, kiss me.
3465580 3467241 Kiss me goodbye!
3473688 3474950 No, Scarlett.
3475023 3476957 Oh, Ashley, I love you.
3477192 3480355 I've always loved you.<br />I've never loved anyone else.
3480428 3483056 I only married Charles just to hurt you.
3483131 3485497 Ashley, tell me you love me.
3486301 3488861 I'll live on it the rest of my life.
3490672 3491934 Goodbye.
3511726 3513956 When the war is over, Ashley.
3514796 3516730 When the war is over.
3537215 3539581 And there's a place back home...
3539751 3543346 where a wild plum tree comes to flower<br />in the springtime.
3544222 3546281 Down by the creek, you know.
3546358 3548155 Yes, I know, I know.
3548860 3552421 When we were little,<br />my brother Jeff and I used to...
3552497 3555933 I told you about my brother Jeff,<br />didn't I, ma'am?
3556268 3557792 I know I did.
3557903 3559029 He...
3559304 3562137 We don't know where Jeff is now, ma'am.
3562574 3565873 Since Bull Run we haven't heard<br />anything and...
3566411 3568845 Please, we must have<br />your temperature now.
3568914 3571382 Just take this in your mouth<br />and not talk anymore.
3571450 3572883 Not just now.
3573385 3576183 Melanie, I'm so tired. I've got to go home.
3577322 3579381 Aren't you tired, Melanie?
3579624 3581785 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3582828 3584386 This might be...
3584463 3585657 Ashley.
3586231 3589098 And only strangers here to comfort him.
3589534 3591661 No, I'm not tired, Scarlett.
3592738 3594433 They could all be...
3594906 3596168 Ashley.
3608420 3612516 I've been sitting by this curb one solid<br />hour waiting to speak to you, Miss Wilkes.
3612591 3615287 Go on, you trash,<br />don't you be pestering these ladies.
3615360 3616884 Don't talk to her, Melly.
3616962 3619328 It's all right, Scarlett. Who are you?
3619398 3621923 My name's Belle Watling.<br />But that don't matter.
3622034 3624229 I expect you think<br />I've got no business here.
3624302 3626964 Hadn't you best tell me<br />what you want to see me about?
3627039 3630270 First time I come here, I says,<br />"Belle, you're a nurse. "
3630342 3632606 But the ladies didn't want<br />my kind of nursing.
3632677 3634668 Well, they was more than likely right.
3634746 3636873 Then I tried giving them money.
3636948 3639178 My money wasn't good enough<br />for them, either.
3639251 3640582 Old peahens!
3641153 3643713 I know a gentleman<br />who says you're a human being.
3643789 3647520 If you are, which they ain't,<br />you'll take my money for the hospital.
3647592 3650686 What are you doing here?<br />Haven't you been told twice already?
3650762 3652753 This time I'm conversing with Miss Wilkes.
3652831 3654924 You might as well take my money,<br />Miss Wilkes.
3655000 3657025 It's good money, even if it is mine.
3657102 3658694 I'm sure you're very generous.
3658770 3662103 No, I'm not. I'm a Confederate<br />like everybody else, that's all.
3662174 3663698 Of course you are.
3663775 3666039 Some folks here wouldn't feel that way.
3666111 3669205 But maybe they ain't<br />as good Christians as you.
3675954 3678684 Look, Mrs. Meade.<br />It's a great deal of money.
3679024 3681185 $10, $20, $30, $50.
3681493 3684291 And it's not our paper money. It's gold.
3684463 3686397 Let me see that handkerchief.
3686465 3687693 "R. B."
3689935 3693132 And she's driving away<br />in Rhett Butler's carriage!
3694172 3698040 Oh, if I just wasn't a lady<br />what wouldn't I tell that varmint!
3732110 3734943 "The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want.
3735180 3738115 "He maketh me to lie down<br />in green pastures.
3738216 3739774 "He leadeth...
3741586 3743451 "He restoreth my soul.
3743855 3747882 "He leadeth me in the paths<br />of righteousness for his name's sake.
3748093 3751654 "Yeah, though I walk through the valley<br />of the shadow of death...
3751730 3753561 "I will fear no evil.
3753632 3755156 "For thou art with me.
3755233 3758066 "Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. "
3758670 3759728 Yankees!
3760305 3763399 Yankees!<br />Dr. Meade, they're getting closer.
3763475 3766933 They'll never get into Atlanta. They'll<br />never get through old Peg-Leg Hood.
3767012 3768673 We'll be safe in the hospital.
3768847 3771077 Give me something for the pain.
3771750 3773411 Give me something for the pain!
3773485 3776613 Sorry, son, we haven't got anything<br />to give you.
3777722 3780156 These animals is driving me crazy!
3780817 3782978 What luck! You've got my jack!
3783053 3785647 Give me an ace and I'll start another war!
3785722 3787383 I'll bid the moon!
3791294 3795355 I'll never see you or Pa again.
3796333 3798062 This leg's got to come off, soldier.
3798134 3800466 No, no! Leave me alone!
3800570 3801696 I'm sorry, soldier.
3801771 3803705 We're all run out of chloroform, Dr. Meade.
3803773 3805434 Then we'll have to operate without it.
3805508 3807305 No, no! Leave me alone!
3807377 3809641 You can't do it. I won't let you do it to me!
3809713 3812944 Tell Dr. Wilson to take this leg off<br />immediately. It's gangrene.
3813016 3815075 No, no! Don't!
3815151 3817881 I haven't seen my family in three days.
3817954 3820286 I'm going home for half an hour.
3820390 3821948 Orderly! Give me a lift.
3826096 3828326 Nurse, you can free this bed.
3829332 3830856 Miss Scarlett!
3832502 3834197 Why, Frank Kennedy!
3834270 3836329 Miss Suellen, is she well?
3836539 3839702 When did they bring you in?<br />You all right? Are you badly hurt?
3839776 3842370 - But Miss Suellen, is she...<br />- She's all right, but I...
3842445 3844345 Dr. Wilson needs you<br />in the operating room.
3844414 3847406 He's going to take off that leg.<br />Better hurry.
3848685 3850118 I'll be back.
3851721 3854212 No, no, leave me alone!
3854657 3857421 No, no, I can't stand it!
3857861 3860489 No don't! Don't cut!
3861264 3862595 Don't cut!
3863166 3864963 Don't, don't!
3865335 3866461 Please!
3866870 3868565 Where's the nurse?
3873143 3874167 Dr. Wilson's waiting.
3874244 3876439 Let him wait! I'm going home!<br />I've done enough.
3876513 3880005 I don't want any more men dying!<br />I don't want any more!
3941144 3942372 Big Sam!
3943379 3945347 Big Sam! Big Sam!
3946449 3948940 Almighty Moses, it's Miss Scarlett!
3949018 3950178 Big Sam!
3950720 3951846 Big Sam!
3951921 3955288 Sam, 'Lige, 'Postel, Prophet!<br />I'm so glad to see you!
3955358 3958054 Tell me about Tara, about my mother.<br />She didn't write me.
3958127 3960186 - She's gone and got sick, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Sick?
3960263 3961753 Just a little bit sick, that's all.
3961831 3965426 Your pa was wild when they wouldn't<br />let him fight 'cause of his broken knee.
3965502 3969632 He had fits when they took us field hands<br />to dig ditches for white soldiers to hide in.
3969706 3971537 But your ma says<br />the Confederacy needs us.
3971608 3973041 So we's gonna dig for the South.
3973109 3974235 Sam, was there a doctor?
3974310 3975436 Ma'am, we've got to march.
3975512 3978345 Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br />Don't worry, we'll stop them Yankees.
3978414 3982111 Goodbye, Big Sam. Goodbye, boys.<br />If any of you get sick or hurt, let me know.
3982185 3983618 - Goodbye, Miss Scarlett.<br />- Goodbye.
3983686 3985347 - Goodbye.<br />- Goodbye.
4005508 4006668 Scarlett!
4006843 4008037 Scarlett!
4011347 4014407 Climb into this buggy.<br />This is no day for walking.
4014484 4015712 You'll get run over.
4015785 4017013 Oh, Rhett!
4017487 4019717 Drive me to Aunt Pitty's, please.
4021291 4023691 Panic's a pretty sight, isn't it?
4026529 4029123 That's just another of Gen. Sherman's<br />calling cards.
4029198 4030529 He'll be paying us a visit soon.
4030600 4033364 I've got to get out of here<br />before the Yankees come!
4033436 4035370 And leave your work at the hospital?
4035438 4039238 Or have you had enough of death and lice<br />and men chopped up?
4039309 4041607 I suppose you weren't meant<br />for sick men, Scarlett.
4041678 4043703 Don't talk to me like that. I'm so scared.
4043780 4045839 I wish I could get out of here.
4045915 4047348 Let's get out of here together.
4047417 4050648 No use staying here and letting the South<br />come down around your ears.
4050720 4053518 There are too many nice places<br />to go and visit.
4053590 4055888 Mexico, London, Paris...
4055959 4057824 - With you?<br />- Yes, ma'am.
4058127 4061563 With a man who understands you<br />and admires you for just what you are.
4061631 4064725 I figure we belong together,<br />being the same sort.
4065101 4069765 I've been waiting for you to grow up and<br />get that sad-eyed Ashley out of your heart.
4069839 4074276 Well, I hear Mrs. Wilkes is going to have<br />a baby in another month or so.
4074344 4078303 It'll be hard loving a man<br />with a wife and baby clinging to him.
4080717 4084778 Well, here we are. Are you going with me,<br />or are you getting out?
4085088 4089889 I hate and despise you, Rhett Butler,<br />and I'll hate and despise you till I die.
4090593 4093460 Oh, no, you won't, Scarlett. Not that long.
4101004 4102528 Miss Scarlett! Miss Scarlett!
4102605 4106302 Folks is all going to Macon and folks is<br />running away and running away.
4106376 4109743 I can't bear it!<br />Those cannon balls right in my ears!
4109812 4112042 I faint every time I hear one!
4112982 4115314 Uncle Peter, look out for that trunk!
4115385 4117012 But, Aunt Pitty, you aren't leaving?
4117086 4119418 I may be a coward, but oh, dear!
4119922 4121856 Yankees in Georgia!
4122058 4123150 How did they ever get in?
4123226 4125956 I'm going, too. Prissy, go pack my things.<br />Get them, quick!
4126029 4127792 Wait, Aunt Pitty, I won't be a minute.
4127864 4129832 Scarlett, do you really think you ought to?
4129899 4130957 Scarlett!
4131034 4134003 What is this?<br />You ain't planning on running away?
4134070 4137528 And don't you dare try to stop me.<br />I'm never going back to that hospital.
4137607 4140633 I've had enough of smelling death<br />and rot and death.
4140710 4143804 I'm going home. I want my mother.<br />My mother needs me.
4143880 4146576 Now you've got to listen to me.<br />You must stay here!
4146649 4149641 Without a chaperon, Dr. Meade?<br />It simply isn't done!
4149719 4152279 Good heavens, woman, this is war,<br />not a garden party!
4152355 4153982 You've got to stay. Melanie needs you.
4154057 4155115 Oh, bother Melanie.
4155191 4157682 She's ill already.<br />She shouldn't even be having a baby.
4157760 4158988 She may have a difficult time.
4159062 4160290 Can't we take her along?
4160363 4161853 Do you want her to take that chance?
4161931 4163489 To be jounced over rough roads...
4163566 4165500 and have her baby ahead of time,<br />in a buggy?
4165568 4167433 It isn't my baby! You take care of her!
4167503 4169368 Scarlett! We haven't enough doctors...
4169439 4171737 much less nurses<br />to look after a sick woman.
4171808 4173332 You've got to stay for Melanie.
4173409 4174398 What for?
4174510 4176478 I don't know anything about babies<br />being born!
4176546 4178138 I knows, I knows.
4178214 4181047 I knows how to do it.<br />I's done it lots and lots.
4181117 4184086 Let me, Doctor, let me.<br />I can do everything.
4184153 4187247 - Good. Then I'll rely on you to help us.<br />- Yes, Doctor.
4187323 4190554 Ashley's fighting in the field,<br />fighting for the cause.
4190626 4193151 He may never come back. He may die.
4193863 4196388 Scarlett, we owe him a well-born child.
4196899 4197957 Ashley.
4198034 4200559 If you're coming, Scarlett, hurry!
4200937 4202529 I promised Ashley...
4202605 4203697 something.
4203773 4205297 Then you'll stay?
4205742 4208870 Good. Go along, Miss Pittypat.<br />Scarlett's staying.
4208945 4212142 Go on, Uncle Peter.<br />Oh, dear, I don't know what to do.
4212248 4214739 It's like the end of the world.
4215518 4218954 Uncle Peter, my smelling salts.
4225728 4228026 Melanie, it's all your fault!
4228598 4230589 I hate you, I hate you!
4230666 4232463 And I hate your baby!
4232568 4234900 If only I hadn't promised Ashley!
4234971 4237201 If only I hadn't promised him!
4266269 4268635 Stop! Stop, please stop!
4268704 4270296 Is it true? Are the Yankees coming?
4270373 4272364 I'm afraid so, ma'am.<br />The Army's pulling out.
4272441 4274671 Pulling out of Atlanta?<br />Leaving us to the Yankees?
4274744 4276211 Not leaving, ma'am, evacuating.
4276279 4279407 We've got to before Sherman cuts<br />the McDonough Road and catches us.
4279482 4282383 It can't be true! It can't be true!<br />What'll I do?
4282451 4286615 Better refugee south right quick, ma'am.<br />If you'll excuse me, ma'am.
4287356 4288550 Prissy!
4289492 4291119 Prissy, come here!
4291194 4294652 Pack my things and Miss Melanie's, too.<br />We're going to Tara right away.
4294730 4295788 The Yankees are coming!
4295865 4297059 Yes, ma'am.
4298668 4299692 Scarlett!
4300303 4301327 Scarlett!
4301737 4303898 Melly, we're going to...
4306075 4307167 Melly!
4309812 4313145 I'm sorry to be such a bother, Scarlett.
4315685 4317915 It began at daybreak.
4318454 4319921 But, but...
4320723 4322850 But the Yankees are coming.
4323993 4325517 Poor Scarlett.
4326028 4329156 You'd be at Tara now with your mother,<br />wouldn't you...
4329966 4331797 if it weren't for me?
4332435 4334266 Oh, Scarlett, darling...
4334670 4336570 you've been so good to me.
4336672 4339140 No sister could have been sweeter.
4342378 4344710 I've been lying here thinking...
4345481 4347176 if I should die...
4348217 4350242 will you take my baby?
4352555 4354580 Oh, fiddle-dee-dee, Melly.
4354657 4357592 Aren't things bad enough<br />without you talking about dying?
4358027 4360928 - I'll send for Dr. Meade right away.<br />- Not yet, Scarlett.
4360997 4364398 I couldn't let Dr. Meade sit here<br />for hours, while...
4364634 4368661 - while all those poor, wounded boys...<br />- Prissy!
4369705 4371969 Prissy! Prissy! Come here, quick!
4372041 4373508 Go get Dr. Meade! Run, quick!
4373576 4375942 Yes, ma'am. The baby!
4376646 4379774 Well, don't stand there like a scared goat.<br />Run!
4381517 4385510 Hurry! I'll sell you South, I will!<br />I swear I will!
4387256 4389019 Where's that Prissy?
4392061 4394154 This room's like an oven already...
4394230 4396164 and it isn't noon yet.
4399001 4400798 Oh, don't worry, Melly.
4401337 4405000 Mother says it always seems<br />like the doctor will never come.
4406208 4408904 If I don't take a strap to that Prissy!
4416252 4417480 Oh, Melly.
4418154 4420748 You know what I heard<br />about Maybelle Merriwether?
4420823 4423018 You remember that funny-looking beau<br />of hers?
4423092 4426425 The one with a uniform<br />like ladies' red flannel underdrawers.
4426495 4430022 You don't have to keep on talking<br />for my sake, Scarlett.
4430266 4432234 I know how worried you are.
4445481 4449144 Oh, Melly, I'll just go and fetch you<br />some cool water.
4450720 4452312 You're as slow as molasses in January.
4452388 4453946 And where's Dr. Meade?
4454023 4456355 - I ain't never seen him, Miss Scarlett.<br />- What?
4456425 4458791 No, ma'am. He ain't at the hospital.
4458861 4463730 A man, he told me the doctor's down at<br />the car shed with the wounded soldiers...
4463899 4466265 Well, why didn't you go after him?
4466635 4467829 Miss Scarlett.
4467903 4470895 I's scared to go down there<br />to the car shed.
4471240 4475176 There's folks dying down there<br />and I's scared of dead folks.
4477313 4479008 Oh, you go sit by Miss Melly.
4479081 4482915 And don't you be upsetting her,<br />or I'll whip the hide off you!
4520790 4523384 - Have you seen Dr. Meade?<br />- Side, lady, please.
4527329 4528660 Dr. Meade!
4573309 4575038 Dr. Meade! At last!
4575177 4578476 Oh, thank heavens you're here.<br />I need every pair of hands.
4578547 4581448 Come, child! Wake up!<br />We've got work to do.
4581817 4585344 But Melly's having her baby.<br />You've got to come with me!
4585454 4588321 Are you crazy?<br />I can't leave these men for a baby!
4588390 4591223 They're dying, hundreds of them!<br />Get some woman to help you.
4591293 4594387 But there isn't anybody.<br />Dr. Meade, she might die!
4594463 4595521 Die!
4595598 4598533 Look at them!<br />Bleeding to death in front of my eyes!
4598601 4602799 No chloroform! No bandages!<br />Nothing! Nothing to even ease their pain!
4603239 4605605 Now run along and don't bother me.
4605674 4608973 Now don't worry, child.<br />There's nothing to bringing a baby.
4609044 4610534 Now bring those stretchers in here!
4610613 4611602 Dr. Meade!
4611680 4613238 I'm coming.
4632434 4633992 Is the doctor come?
4634637 4636070 No, he can't come.
4636138 4638936 Oh, Miss Scarlett, Miss Melly bad off.
4639074 4641668 He can't come. There's nobody to come.
4642378 4645905 Prissy, you've got to manage<br />without the doctor. I'll help you.
4645981 4647778 Oh, lordy, Miss Scarlett.
4648984 4650281 Well, what is it?
4650352 4652616 Lordy, we've got to have a doctor.
4652688 4655521 I don't know nothing<br />about birthing babies.
4656859 4658690 - What do you mean?<br />- I don't know...
4658761 4660592 You told me you knew everything about it.
4660663 4662722 I don't know how come I told such a lie.
4662798 4666325 Ma ain't never let me around<br />when folks was having them.
4666735 4667827 Scarlett!
4668437 4669563 Scarlett!
4670272 4672069 Oh, Miss Scarlett...
4672741 4673969 Stop it!
4675477 4676910 Go light a fire in the stove!
4676979 4679948 Keep boiling water in the kettle,<br />get me the ball of twine and...
4680015 4682540 and all the clean towels you can find,<br />and the scissors.
4682618 4684449 Don't come telling me you can't find them.
4684520 4686681 Go get them, and get them quick!
4687890 4689152 Scarlett!
4698400 4699731 Coming, Melly.
4700836 4702030 Coming.
4705874 4708172 Go, Scarlett, before the Yankees get here.
4708244 4710235 I'm not afraid. You know I won't leave you.
4710312 4712007 It's no use. I'm going to die.
4712081 4715278 Don't be a goose, Melly. Hold on to me.<br />Hold on to me.
4715351 4717546 Talk to me, Scarlett.
4717620 4719747 Please talk to me.
4719922 4721219 Don't try to be brave, Melly.
4721290 4723690 Yell all you want, there's nobody to hear.
4723759 4728093 Ma says that if you puts a knife<br />under the bed, it cuts the pain in two.
4733502 4735265 Capt. Butler!
4736138 4737435 Capt. Butler!
4739208 4740232 Who do you want?
4740309 4741298 Capt. Butler.
4741377 4744039 He's upstairs. Belle Watling's<br />giving a party.
4746282 4747476 Thank you.
4749818 4752252 Capt. Butler! Oh, Capt. Butler!
4752488 4754547 What's all the rumpus about?
4754723 4757920 I's got a message for Capt. Butler,<br />Miss Watling!
4758127 4761585 Capt. Butler, you come out here<br />in the streets to me.
4762798 4763890 What is it, Prissy?
4763966 4766457 Miss Scarlett, she done sent me for you.
4766635 4769365 Miss Melly, she done had her baby today.
4769872 4772773 A fine baby boy...
4773242 4776006 and Miss Scarlett and me, we brung him.
4776078 4777739 Do you mean to tell me that Scarlett...
4777813 4781408 Well, it was mostly me, Capt. Butler,<br />only Miss Scarlett...
4781483 4786352 she helped me a little, but I don't expect<br />no doctor could have done no better!
4786655 4790785 Only Miss Melly, she feeling kind of poorly<br />now it's all over!
4791960 4793257 Yes, I can believe that!
4793329 4796924 And the Yankees is coming,<br />and Miss Scarlett, she said...
4798200 4800930 Oh, Capt. Butler, the Yankees is here!
4801603 4804868 Please come and bring your carriage<br />for us right away.
4805007 4807805 I'm sorry, Prissy, but the Army<br />took my horse and carriage.
4807876 4810208 You'd better come upstairs.<br />I'll see what I can do.
4810279 4811837 Oh, no, Capt. Butler!
4812114 4816744 Ma would wear me out with a cornstalk<br />if I was to go into Miss Watling's.
4818020 4821649 Any of you beauties know where I can<br />steal a horse for a good cause?
4828564 4831397 - Whoa, Marse Robert.<br />- Is that you, Rhett?
4831667 4834693 - We's here, Miss Scarlett. We's here!<br />- Rhett, I knew you'd come.
4834770 4836601 Good evening. Nice weather we're having.
4836672 4838833 Prissy tells me you're planning<br />on taking a trip.
4838907 4840932 If you make any jokes now, I'll kill you!
4841009 4842340 Don't tell me you're frightened.
4842411 4846370 I'm scared to death. If you had the sense<br />of a goat, you'd be scared too.
4846448 4848439 - Oh, the Yankees.<br />- No, not yet.
4848517 4851247 That's what's left of our Army,<br />blowing up the ammunition...
4851320 4852446 so the Yankees won't get it.
4852521 4854216 We've got to get out of here.
4854289 4855278 At your service, madam.
4855357 4856949 Just where are you figuring on going?
4857025 4858049 Home, to Tara.
4858127 4860357 They've been fighting all day around Tara.
4860429 4862863 Do you think you can parade<br />through the Yankee Army...
4862931 4865399 with a sick woman,<br />a baby, and a simple-minded darky...
4865467 4867128 or do you intend leaving them behind?
4867202 4869727 They're going with me. I'm going home.<br />You can't stop me!
4869805 4873536 Don't you know it's dangerous jouncing<br />Mrs. Wilkes over miles of open country?
4873609 4875042 I want my mother!
4875911 4877811 I want to go home to Tara!
4877880 4879677 Tara's probably been burned<br />to the ground.
4879748 4881943 The woods are full of stragglers<br />from both armies.
4882017 4884383 The least they'll do is take the horse<br />away from you.
4884453 4887047 It isn't much of an animal,<br />but I had trouble stealing it.
4887122 4890182 I'm going home if I have to walk<br />every step of the way.
4890259 4893456 I'll kill you if you try to stop me.<br />I will, I will!
4893962 4895054 I will!
4900869 4904396 All right, darling, all right.<br />Now you shall go home.
4906275 4909733 I guess anybody who did what you've done<br />today can take care of Sherman.
4911346 4913678 Here, now. Stop crying.
4916185 4918483 Now blow your nose like a good little girl.
4918754 4919914 There.
4931633 4932725 Prissy! What are you doing?
4932801 4934234 I's packing, Miss Scarlett.
4934303 4935770 Stop it and come get the baby.
4935971 4936960 Yes, ma'am.
4939608 4940734 Melly!
4941743 4944576 Mrs. Wilkes, we're taking you to Tara.
4944813 4945871 Tara...
4945948 4947813 - It's the only way, Melly.<br />- No.
4947883 4950613 Sherman will burn the house<br />over our heads if we stay.
4950886 4952319 It's all right, Melly.
4952387 4953945 My baby.
4954556 4956080 My poor baby.
4960629 4963063 Have you the strength to put your arms<br />around my neck?
4963131 4964894 I think so.
4967703 4968965 Never mind.
4969037 4971403 Oh, Ashley, Charles...
4971473 4973065 What is it? What does she want?
4973141 4975974 Ashley's picture, Charles' sword.<br />She wants us to bring them.
4976044 4977068 Get them.
4993028 4994086 What's that?
4994329 4997628 Our gallant lads must have set fire<br />to the warehouses near the depot.
4997699 5000566 There's enough ammunition<br />in the boxcars to blow us to Tara.
5000636 5002604 We'll have to hurry<br />to get across the tracks.
5002671 5004400 - You're not going that way!<br />- We have to.
5004473 5007636 The McDonough Road's the only one<br />the Yankees haven't cut yet.
5016885 5019319 Oh, wait. I forgot to lock the front door.
5019454 5020751 What are you laughing at?
5020822 5022949 At you, locking the Yankees out.
5040008 5041635 Oh, dear, I wish they'd hurry.
5041710 5044440 I wouldn't be in such a hurry<br />to see them go if I were you.
5044513 5046981 With them goes the last semblance<br />of law and order.
5049351 5051512 The scavengers aren't wasting any time.
5055991 5057720 We've got to get out of here fast.
5057793 5059021 There's a horse!
5070505 5072166 Down the alley, cut them off.
5086154 5087849 Give me that horse.
5098033 5099057 Miss Scarlett!
5103405 5106033 They haven't left much for the Yankees<br />to take, have they?
5106108 5109566 We'll have to make a dash for it<br />before the fire reaches that ammunition.
5130732 5131790 Come on!
5136304 5137965 Throw me your shawl.
5140642 5144203 Sorry, but you'll like it better<br />if you don't see anything.
5203572 5205563 Take a good look, my dear.
5206007 5207031 It's a historic moment.
5207109 5208576 You can tell your grandchildren...
5208643 5211874 how you watched the old South<br />disappear one night.
5228230 5230630 They were going to lick the Yankees<br />in a month.
5230699 5232530 Poor gallant fools!
5232601 5233966 They make me sick, all of them!
5234035 5237163 Getting us all into this<br />with their swaggering and boasting.
5237506 5240839 That's the way I felt once<br />about their swaggering and boasting.
5241710 5244076 Rhett, I'm so glad<br />you aren't with the Army.
5244146 5248412 You can be proud now, proud that you've<br />been smarter than all of them.
5250819 5252286 I'm not so proud.
5271740 5272798 Why did you stop?
5272874 5275604 This is the turn to Tara.<br />Let the horse breathe a bit.
5275977 5277001 Mrs. Wilkes.
5277078 5280377 Miss Melly done fainted way back,<br />Capt. Butler.
5280582 5282140 Well, she's probably better off.
5282217 5285277 She couldn't stand the pain<br />if she were conscious.
5285787 5288654 Scarlett, are you still determined<br />to do this crazy thing?
5288723 5291556 Yes. I know we can get through, Rhett.<br />I'm sure we can.
5291626 5293457 Not we, my dear. You.
5293829 5295296 I'm leaving you here.
5295597 5298191 You're what? Rhett, where are you going?
5298433 5300663 I'm going, my dear, to join the Army.
5300869 5303497 You're joking!<br />I could kill you for scaring me so!
5303572 5305301 I'm very serious, Scarlett.
5305373 5308103 I'm going to join up<br />with our brave lads in gray.
5308176 5309302 But they're running away!
5309377 5312676 No. They'll turn and make a last stand,<br />if I know anything about them.
5312747 5315875 When they do, I'll be with them.<br />A little late, but "Better late... "
5315951 5317680 Rhett, you must be joking!
5318720 5320244 Selfish to the end, aren't you?
5320322 5324224 Thinking only of your own precious hide,<br />with never a thought for the noble cause.
5324292 5326055 Rhett, how could you do this to me...
5326127 5329062 and why should you go now,<br />after it's all over and I need you?
5329130 5330119 Why? Why?
5330198 5331222 Why?
5331299 5334291 Maybe it's because I've always had<br />a weakness for lost causes...
5334369 5335666 once they're really lost.
5335737 5336829 Or maybe...
5338073 5340098 maybe I'm ashamed of myself.
5341343 5342332 Who knows?
5342410 5345277 You should die of shame<br />to leave me here alone and helpless!
5345580 5347047 You helpless?
5348116 5350880 Heaven help the Yankees<br />if they capture you!
5351419 5354479 Now climb down here.<br />I want to say goodbye.
5354823 5355812 No!
5356424 5357789 Climb down.
5361162 5364495 Oh, Rhett, please don't go.<br />You can't leave me, please.
5364566 5366295 I'll never forgive you!
5366368 5370395 I'm not asking you to forgive me.<br />I'll never understand or forgive myself.
5370472 5374909 And if a bullet gets me, so help me,<br />I'll laugh at myself for being an idiot.
5375143 5376770 But there's one thing I do know...
5376845 5378472 and that is that I love you, Scarlett.
5378546 5382038 In spite of you, me and the whole<br />silly world going to pieces around us...
5382117 5383209 I love you...
5383285 5385810 because we're alike. Bad lots, both of us.
5386187 5387984 Selfish and shrewd...
5388323 5391690 but able to look things in the eyes<br />and call them by their right names.
5391760 5393660 Don't hold me like that!
5393762 5395593 Scarlett, look at me.
5396765 5399199 I love you<br />more than I've ever loved any woman.
5399334 5402565 And I've waited longer for you<br />than I've ever waited for any woman.
5402637 5403831 Let me alone!
5405006 5407531 Here's a soldier of the South<br />who loves you, Scarlett...
5407609 5409236 wants to feel your arms around him...
5409311 5412178 wants to carry the memory<br />of your kisses into battle with him.
5412247 5413874 Never mind about loving me.
5413949 5417715 You're a woman sending a soldier<br />to his death with a beautiful memory.
5417986 5419783 Scarlett, kiss me.
5420922 5422287 Kiss me, once.
5427629 5430097 You low-down, cowardly, nasty thing, you!
5430398 5434198 They were right! Everybody was right!<br />You aren't a gentleman!
5436972 5439133 A minor point at such a moment.
5440942 5442034 Here.
5442677 5444975 If anyone lays a hand on that nag,<br />shoot him.
5445046 5446980 But don't make a mistake<br />and shoot the nag.
5447048 5451178 Oh, go on. I want you to go.<br />I hope a cannonball lands slap on you.
5451252 5453049 I hope you're blown into a million pieces!
5453121 5456022 Never mind the rest.<br />I follow your general idea.
5456091 5458184 And when I'm dead on the altar<br />of my country...
5458259 5460591 I hope your conscience hurts you.
5461162 5462595 Goodbye, Scarlett.
5488623 5491217 Come on, you! We're going home.
5566968 5568959 Oh, my poor baby.
5570872 5572305 Don't worry, Melly.
5572540 5574667 Mother will take care of him<br />when we get home.
5574742 5577540 Miss Scarlett, I's powerful hungry.
5577779 5579576 We's got to have something to eat.
5579647 5580909 Oh, hush up!
5581316 5584308 We're nearly at Twelve Oaks.<br />We'll stop there.
5585086 5586246 Go on!
5653354 5656346 Ashley, I'm glad you're not here<br />to see this.
5657659 5659354 The Yankees!
5659427 5661361 The dirty Yankees!
5676010 5678501 Prissy, come tie up this cow!
5679013 5681379 We don't need no cow, Miss Scarlett.
5681449 5684509 We'll be home soon,<br />and I's scared of cows.
5685119 5688145 Tear up your petticoat and tie her<br />on to the back of the wagon.
5688389 5692018 We need milk for the baby, and<br />we don't know what we'll find at home.
5701269 5703260 Melly! Melly, we're home!
5703471 5704495 We're at Tara!
5704572 5706437 Hurry! Move, you brute!
5708042 5710476 Miss Scarlett, he's dead!
5710945 5715211 I can't see the house! Is it there?<br />I can't see the house. Have they burned it?
5718953 5720580 Oh, it's all right.
5720655 5722987 It's all right! They haven't burned it!
5723324 5724655 It's still there!
5728329 5730889 Mother! Mother! I'm home.
5733635 5735626 Mother! Mother! I'm home.
5741142 5744077 Mother, let me in. It's me, Scarlett!
5748583 5749675 Pa!
5750318 5751785 Oh, Pa!
5752520 5753851 I'm home!
5755356 5756448 I'm home!
5759527 5760926 Katie.
5761696 5763220 Katie Scarlett.
5764198 5765995 Oh, darling.
5777178 5778372 Mammy!
5779447 5782883 - Mammy, I'm home.<br />- Honey, honey child!
5784686 5786779 Oh, Mammy, I'm so...
5788456 5789980 Where's Mother?
5790491 5791515 Why...
5792093 5795688 Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen,<br />they was sick with the typhoid.
5796431 5799264 They had it bad,<br />but they's doing all right now.
5799600 5801067 Just weak like little kittens.
5801135 5803103 But where's Mother?
5804806 5805932 Well...
5806507 5811410 Miss Ellen, she went down to nurse<br />that Emmie Slattery, that white trash...
5812113 5814138 and she took down with it, too.
5816484 5818884 - And last night, she...<br />- Mother!
5822523 5823751 Mother.
5891692 5893159 Miss Scarlett, honey.
5893227 5895957 If there's anything I can do,<br />Miss Scarlett...
5896831 5898355 What did you do with Miss Melly?
5898433 5901027 Don't you worry your pretty head<br />about Miss Melly, child.
5901102 5903935 I done slapped her in bed already,<br />along with the baby.
5904005 5906473 You better put that cow I brought<br />into the barn, Pork.
5906541 5908839 There ain't no barn no more, Miss Scarlett.
5908943 5910877 The Yankees done burned it for firewood.
5910945 5913072 They used the house<br />for their headquarters.
5913147 5914808 They camped all around the place.
5914882 5916349 Yankees in Tara!
5916417 5919352 Yes, ma'am, and they stole<br />most everything they didn't burn.
5919420 5923481 All the clothes and all the rugs<br />and even Miss Ellen's rosaries.
5925726 5927694 I'm starving, Pork.<br />Get me something to eat.
5927762 5930959 There ain't nothing to eat, honey.<br />They took it all.
5931299 5932857 All the chickens, everything?
5933000 5934695 They took them the first thing.
5934769 5937704 And what they didn't eat<br />they carried off across their saddles.
5937772 5940536 Don't tell me any more<br />about what they did!
5956424 5958415 What's this, Pa?
5958493 5959585 Whiskey?
5960061 5961323 Yes, daughter.
5965366 5967493 Katie Scarlett, that's enough!
5967568 5970901 You're not knowing spirits,<br />you'll make yourself tipsy.
5970972 5972872 I hope it makes me drunk.
5973174 5974766 I'd like to be drunk.
5977912 5979038 Oh, Pa.
5982483 5984348 What are those papers?
5985286 5986412 Bonds.
5988289 5989984 They're all we've saved.
5990057 5991649 All we have left.
5992193 5993387 Bonds.
5993794 5995523 What kind of bonds, Pa?
5996597 5999157 Why, Confederate bonds,<br />of course, daughter.
5999333 6000994 Confederate bonds.
6001302 6003532 What good are they to anybody?
6003771 6006433 I'll not have you talking like that,<br />Katie Scarlett.
6006641 6010702 Oh, Pa, what are we going to do<br />with no money and nothing to eat?
6012179 6014147 We must ask your mother.
6014882 6016213 That's it!
6016651 6018881 We must ask Mrs. O'Hara.
6020388 6022117 - Ask Mother?<br />- Yes.
6023024 6025584 Mrs. O'Hara will know what's to be done.
6026694 6028594 Now don't be bothering me.
6028663 6030426 Go out for a ride.
6031065 6032327 I'm busy.
6050318 6051876 Oh, Pa...
6052620 6054713 don't worry about anything.
6055523 6057388 Katie Scarlett's home.
6059794 6061455 You needn't worry.
6076577 6077601 Miss Scarlett.
6077678 6081614 What are we gonna to do with nothing<br />to feed those sick folks and that child?
6083150 6084742 I don't know, Mammy.
6085586 6086712 I don't know.
6086787 6089847 We ain't got nothing but radishes<br />in the garden.
6089924 6092984 Miss Scarlett,<br />Miss Suellen and Miss Carreen...
6093060 6095426 they's fussing to be sponged off.
6096130 6097688 Where are the other servants, Mammy?
6097765 6100325 Miss Scarlett, there's only<br />just me and Pork left.
6100401 6102665 The others went off to the war<br />or runned away.
6102737 6105968 I can't take care of that baby<br />and sick folks, too.
6106841 6108604 I's only got two hands.
6109043 6113412 Who's going to milk that cow,<br />Miss Scarlett? We's houseworkers.
6196430 6198398 As God is my witness...
6198966 6202265 As God is my witness,<br />they're not going to lick me.
6202703 6207572 I'm going to live through this, and when<br />it's all over, I'll never be hungry again.
6207942 6209603 No, nor any of my folks.
6211178 6213738 If I have to lie, steal, cheat or kill.
6215049 6218917 As God is my witness,<br />I'll never be hungry again!
