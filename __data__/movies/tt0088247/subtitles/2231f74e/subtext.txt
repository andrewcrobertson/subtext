317015 318505 Me.
320985 322282 Come on.
324689 326680 What's wrong with this picture?
334866 336925 Nice night for a walk, eh?
341706 343003 Nice night for a walk.
344142 345837 Washday tomorrow.
345877 348471 Nothing clean, right?
348513 350140 Nothing clean. Right.
350181 353344 I think this guy's a couple cans<br />short of a six-pack.
353384 354874 Your clothes.
355887 358185 Give them to me... now.
358222 359746 Fuck you, asshole!
391089 393148 Hey, sugar, how about it?
393191 398219 I don't have to put up<br />with that bullshit, man.
398262 400526 She's always after me.
400565 402192 I don't... I don't...
463394 467558 Hey, buddy, did you just see<br />a real bright light?
469367 470698 He the guy?
471769 473327 - Hold it right there!<br />- He's rabbiting.
473371 474963 Hey! I said hold it!
475006 476166 Go!
477808 480709 That son of a bitch<br />took my pants!
524522 526285 What day is it? The date!
526324 528656 The 12th of May. Thursday.
528693 530786 - What year?<br />- What?
543908 545034 He's got my gun! Let's go!
631162 633630 3831, they lost the suspect.
720249 721944 Guard it for me, big buns.
727323 729086 I'm late.
729125 730683 So am I.
774170 775967 - I'm in it.<br />- So am I.
782011 783603 Honey, could I have<br />that coffee now, please?
783646 784806 Yes, sir.
785982 787176 Who gets the burly beef?
787216 788581 I ordered barbecued beef.
788618 790483 I think that's mine,<br />but I didn't order fries.
790520 792010 He gets the barbecued beef.<br />Mine's the chili beef deluxe.
792054 793715 Who gets the burly beef?
793756 795451 Miss, we're ready to order now.
795491 796924 Yes, ma'am.
796959 800122 I'm so sorry.
800163 801994 Oh, lord.
803900 805925 This isn't real leather, is it?
805968 808459 This special sucks.
808504 811473 Nice going, kid.<br />Ought to give you the tip.
814477 816968 Look, in a hundred years,<br />who's going to care?
825755 827416 The 12-gauge auto-loader.
829959 831688 That's Italian.
831727 833285 You can go pump or auto.
834730 837631 The.45 long slide,<br />with laser sighting.
837667 839362 These are brand-new.<br />We just got them in.
839402 840562 That's a good gun.
841938 843496 Just touch the trigger,<br />the beam comes on...
843539 845564 and you put the red dot<br />where you want the bullet to go.
845608 846768 You can't miss.
848678 850339 Anything else?
850379 853246 A phased plasma rifle<br />in the 40-watt range.
853282 854943 Just what you see, pal.
856152 857449 The Uzi 9mm.
858988 861252 You know your weapons, buddy.
861290 863622 Any one of these is ideal<br />for home defense.
864827 867887 So which will it be?
867930 869056 All.
869098 871532 I may close early today.
871567 873865 There's a fifteen-day wait<br />on the handguns...
873903 876030 but the rifles<br />you can take right now.
877206 878969 - You can't do that.<br />- Wrong.
906302 908896 Hi, baby. Yeah, it's me.
908938 910929 Listen, I need you<br />to come pick me up.
910973 913339 My bike just broke down.
913376 915867 I don't care what you're doing.<br />Come and get me. What the...
917280 921649 Hey, man, you got<br />a serious attitude problem.
974236 975760 Sarah Connor?
989685 992279 I'm on my break, Chuck.<br />Carla's got my station.
992321 995586 Sarah, come here!<br />It's about you. Sort of.
998194 1000253 It's so incredible.<br />You're not gonna believe this.
1000296 1002355 Sit down.<br />You are going to love this.
1002398 1004229 - Shh!<br />- What?
1004266 1006928 ...has been compiled<br />from several witnesses.
1006969 1010200 Once again, Sarah Connor,<br />thirty-five, mother of two...
1010239 1012730 brutally shot to death<br />in her home this afternoon.
1012775 1014402 You're dead, honey.
1245773 1247502 Sorry.
1261255 1265589 First, I'm gonna rip the buttons<br />off your blouse one by one...
1265626 1267389 and then run my tongue<br />down your neck...
1267428 1269896 to your bare, gleaming<br />breasts...
1269930 1271955 and then slowly...
1271999 1275230 slowly pull your jeans off,<br />inch by inch.
1277271 1278704 Ginger, it's Matt!
1278739 1283005 And lick your belly in circles,<br />further and further down...
1283043 1286410 and then pull your panties off<br />with my teeth.
1286447 1287744 Who is this?
1292353 1296517 Oh, Jesus. I'm sorry.<br />I thought you were...
1296557 1298184 Can I talk to Ginger, please?
1298225 1299852 Sure, Bunky.
1301896 1303523 It's the creep.
1306867 1310428 First, I'm gonna rip the buttons<br />off your blouse one by one...
1312306 1314001 You fucking pigs!
1314041 1316168 Wait till I get my hands on you!
1316210 1318201 - Get off of me!<br />- Sit down, fella.
1319213 1320373 Ed.
1322716 1324911 - What do you got?<br />- Dead girl.
1324952 1326317 I can see that.
1326353 1328685 Sarah Ann Connor,<br />secretary, thirty-five...
1328722 1331156 shot six times<br />at less than ten feet.
1331192 1332682 Large caliber weapon.
1332726 1334250 You know, these work.
1335763 1337424 What's this?
1337464 1340797 Dead girl two, sent over from<br />Valley division this afternoon.
1343037 1345801 I'm sure there's a point<br />to all of this.
1345839 1347306 Look at the name, Ed.
1348442 1352242 Sarah Louise Connor.<br />Is this right?
1353948 1355210 You're kidding me.
1355249 1357979 The press is going to be<br />short-stroking it all over.
1358018 1360885 A one-day pattern killer.
1360921 1362479 I hate the weird ones.
1366927 1368087 So?
1370164 1371859 Better than mortal man deserves.
1379840 1381330 Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?
1381375 1383843 No, not lately.<br />Did you check messages?
1383877 1385469 I thought you did.
1391051 1392951 Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...
1392987 1395012 There you are, young man.
1395055 1397023 You mind your mother.
1401228 1403355 Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.
1403397 1406833 Something's come up.<br />I can't make it tonight.
1406867 1408528 Just can't get out of it.
1408569 1410503 Look, I'm really sorry.<br />I'll make it up to you.
1410537 1413370 Call you in a day or so, OK?<br />Sorry. Bye.
1415376 1418470 That bum.<br />So what if he has a Porsche?
1418512 1419638 He can't treat you like this.
1419680 1421443 It's Friday night,<br />for Christ's sake!
1423450 1425077 I'll live.
1425119 1426848 I'll break his kneecaps.
1428155 1431886 Well, Pugsley still loves me,<br />don't you, baby?
1433193 1435753 God. It's disgusting.
1438032 1440899 I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.<br />You and Matt have a good time
1440934 1442663 We will. You, too.
1447841 1449331 Damn it, Matt!
1506399 1507798 Oh, shit.
1507834 1510359 Lieutenant, are you aware<br />that these two killings...
1510403 1511700 occurred<br />in the same order...
1511738 1513035 as their listings<br />in the phone book?
1513072 1515131 Now, what can I tell you guys?<br />No comment.
1515174 1517074 But we've got two murders...
1528454 1530581 That coffee's two hours cold.
1531791 1534783 I put a cigarette out in it.
1534827 1536192 Did you reach the next girl yet?
1536229 1538322 No. I keep getting<br />an answering machine.
1538364 1539854 - Send a unit.<br />- I sent a unit.
1539899 1542129 There's no answer at the door,<br />and the manager's not home.
1542168 1544659 - Call her.<br />- I just called her.
1544704 1546399 Call her again.
1546439 1547929 Give me a cigarette.
1558217 1560208 Hi there.
1560253 1561811 Fooled you.
1561854 1565312 You're talking to a machine,<br />but don't be shy, it's OK.
1565358 1567952 Machines need love, too,<br />so talk to it.
1573332 1574492 Same shit.
1576302 1577530 I can hear it now.
1577570 1580266 He's going to be called<br />the goddamn "Phone Book Killer."
1580306 1583002 I hate these press cases.
1583042 1585169 Especially<br />the weird press cases.
1586913 1589643 - Where you going?<br />- To make a statement.
1589682 1591877 Maybe make these jackals<br />work for us for a change.
1591918 1594443 If I can get on the tube<br />by eleven o'clock...
1594487 1596785 maybe she'll call us.
1596823 1599553 Well, how do I look?
1599592 1600889 Like shit, boss.
1600927 1602326 Your mama.
1602361 1603988 Lieutenant!
1604030 1605691 This just in.
1605731 1607358 Police have announced<br />the name of the victim...
1607400 1609334 in the second of<br />two execution-style murders...
1609368 1611029 which took place today.
1611070 1615473 The names of the two victims<br />are virtually identical.
1615508 1618272 Two hours ago,<br />35-year-old Sarah Ann Connor...
1618311 1620779 was pronounced dead at the scene<br />in her Santa Monica apartment...
1620813 1621973 Can we change this?
1622014 1623140 Sarah Louise Connor was slain...
1623182 1624774 Don't touch it!
1624817 1626944 ...earlier today in her home.
1626986 1628419 Now, police<br />are refusing to speculate...
1628454 1631218 on the apparent similarity<br />between these shooting deaths...
1631257 1633487 and no other connection<br />between the two victims...
1633526 1635790 has been established as of yet.
1635828 1639696 We'll have more on this story<br />as it comes in.
1639732 1642565 A spectacular fire<br />fueled by solvents, oils...
1642602 1644433 and other flammable liquids...
1644470 1647166 swept through an oil company<br />on North Spring Street...
1647206 1650403 just northeast of Chinatown<br />Wednesday night.
1730389 1732584 - Hey, you got a phone?<br />- It's in the back!
1732625 1734616 Hey! Four fifty.
1774500 1776263 This is the Los Angeles Police<br />Department emergency number.
1776302 1777496 Emergency number.
1777536 1779026 All our lines are busy.
1779071 1782632 If you need a police car sent,<br />please stay on the line.
1782775 1784902 Two-eleven in progress...
1784944 1786673 corner of Third and Cameron.
1846872 1848806 Pugsley, shoo! Go on.
1848841 1850968 I'm going to make a belt<br />out of you.
1865758 1867157 Don't make me bust you up, man!
1928020 1929216 Hi there. Fooled you.
1929251 1930412 Hi there. Fooled you.
1930456 1933687 You're talking to a machine,<br />but don't be shy, it's OK.
1933726 1936490 Machines need love, too,<br />so talk to it...
1936529 1939259 and, Ginger, that's me,<br />or Sarah will get back to you.
1939299 1940596 Wait for the beep.
1942201 1944396 Ginger, this is Sarah!<br />Pick up if you're there!
1944437 1948567 I'm at this place on<br />Pico Boulevard called Technoir.
1948608 1950405 I'm really scared.
1950443 1952877 I think that<br />there's somebody's after me.
1952912 1955904 I hope that you play<br />this back soon.
1955949 1958645 I need you and Matt to come and<br />pick me up as soon as possible.
1958685 1961051 The police<br />keep transferring me around.
1961087 1962679 I'm gonna give them another try.
1962722 1967091 The number here is 555-9175.
1967126 1969117 Call me, kiddo.<br />I need your help.
1986179 1987477 It's her.
1987512 1988775 It's her.
1988815 1990908 Sarah Connor?<br />It's Lieutenant Traxler.
1990950 1994511 Lieutenant, don't put me<br />on hold or transfer me!
1994554 1997079 I won't. Just relax.<br />Where are you?
1997123 1998988 In this bar called Technoir.
1999025 2001960 I know. It's on Pico.<br />Are you all right?
2001995 2003656 Yeah, but I don't want to leave.
2003696 2005357 I think there's a guy<br />following me.
2005398 2006763 All right, now listen,<br />Miss Connor.
2006799 2008926 Now listen carefully.<br />You're in a public place...
2008968 2011459 so you'll be safe till<br />we get there, but stay visible.
2011504 2012971 Don't go outside<br />or even to the rest room.
2013006 2014974 I'll have a car there<br />in a hot minute.
2040033 2041591 Hey, that guy didn't pay.
2201928 2203759 Come with me<br />if you want to live.
2212672 2213832 Come on!
2287079 2289843 This is 1-L19.<br />I got a hit-and-run felony.
2289882 2292612 Suspect vehicle...<br />late model gray Ford...
2292652 2294176 headed westbound on Seventh.
2294220 2296415 He's really moving,<br />punching lights all the way.
2296455 2298047 I'm going to need<br />an ambulance...
2298090 2300684 at Seventh and Broadway<br />right now.
2302028 2303188 Hold it!
2307566 2310126 All units watch<br />for a late-model gray Ford...
2310169 2313195 last seen westbound<br />on Seventh and Broadway.
2320146 2321135 Hold on.
2332625 2333785 Are you injured?
2335128 2336288 Are you shot?
2342335 2343859 Do exactly what I say!
2343903 2345837 Exactly!
2345872 2349569 Don't move unless I say.<br />Don't make a sound unless I say.
2349609 2350769 Do you understand?
2351878 2353869 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes! Yes!
2353913 2355778 Please, don't hurt me.
2373699 2375530 I'm here to help you.
2375568 2378935 I'm Reese, Sergeant Techcom,<br />BN38416...
2378971 2380370 assigned to protect you.
2380406 2382101 You've been targeted<br />for termination.
2387647 2392141 Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.
2392185 2394016 This is 1-L19.
2394053 2396248 Westbound on Olympic<br />approaching Overland.
2400893 2403361 This is a mistake.
2403396 2404863 I didn't do anything.
2404897 2406592 No, but you will.
2406632 2408827 It's very important<br />that you live.
2408868 2410495 This isn't true.
2410536 2412299 How could that man<br />just get up after you...
2412338 2415307 He's not a man... a machine.
2415341 2418902 A Terminator.<br />A Cyberdyne Systems Model 101.
2427053 2429385 A machine?
2429422 2431083 Like a robot?
2431124 2434525 Not a robot. A cyborg.
2434560 2435754 A cybernetic organism.
2435795 2438730 - No. He was bleeding.<br />- Just a second.
2441701 2443168 Get your head down!
2488047 2489537 All right, listen.
2489582 2491641 The Terminator's<br />an infiltration unit...
2491684 2493049 part man, part machine.
2493085 2495679 Underneath, it's a hyperalloy<br />combat chassis...
2495721 2499919 microprocessor controlled,<br />fully armored... very tough.
2499959 2502689 But outside,<br />it's living human tissue...
2502728 2507222 flesh, skin, hair, blood...<br />grown for the cyborgs.
2507266 2509166 - Look, I don't know what...<br />- Pay attention!
2509202 2511193 I got to ditch this car.
2516842 2519310 The 600 series had rubber skin.
2519345 2522314 We spotted them easy,<br />but these are new.
2522348 2523815 They look human...
2523849 2526181 sweat, bad breath, everything.
2526219 2527584 Very hard to spot.
2527620 2530145 I had to wait till he moved<br />on you before I could zero him.
2531324 2533019 Look...
2533059 2534959 I am not stupid, you know.
2534994 2537053 They cannot make things<br />like that yet.
2537096 2539462 Not yet.
2539498 2541159 Not for about forty years.
2543703 2545830 Are you saying<br />it's from the future?
2545871 2548931 One possible future.
2548975 2551569 From your point of view...<br />I don't know tech stuff.
2553212 2555737 Then you're from the future,<br />too, is that right?
2555781 2557976 - Right.<br />- Right.
2565925 2568223 Cyborgs don't feel pain.
2568261 2571788 I do. Don't do that again.
2571831 2575665 - Just let me go.<br />- Listen and understand!
2575701 2578135 That Terminator is out there.
2579672 2581401 It can't be bargained with.
2581440 2583237 It can't be reasoned with.
2583276 2588145 It doesn't feel<br />pity or remorse or fear.
2588180 2592708 And it absolutely<br />will not stop ever!
2592752 2594219 Until you are dead.
2604230 2605720 Can you stop it?
2610169 2611659 I don't know.
2613472 2615940 With these weapons,<br />I don't know.
2632525 2635289 All units. Gray Ford suspect<br />vehicle has been found...
2635328 2637728 in a parking structure<br />at Fourth and Beaudry.
2682675 2684404 Why me?
2686779 2688303 Why does it want me?
2695020 2696647 There was a nuclear war...
2698958 2700653 a few years from now.
2703429 2705920 All this...
2705965 2707990 this whole place, everything...
2709235 2710566 it's gone.
2712505 2713938 Just gone.
2714940 2716737 There were survivors.
2716776 2719176 Here, there.
2721514 2723175 Nobody even knew who started it.
2726852 2729753 It was the machines, Sarah.
2729789 2731654 I don't understand.
2731690 2733817 Defense network computers...
2735060 2738154 New... powerful
2739532 2741159 Hooked into everything.
2741200 2742792 Trusted to run it all.
2744236 2746568 They say it got smart...
2746605 2750234 a new order of intelligence.
2750276 2751800 Then it saw all people<br />as a threat...
2751844 2753812 not just the ones<br />on the other side.
2755748 2758046 Decided our fate<br />in a microsecond...
2759618 2761586 extermination.
2776267 2777757 Did you see this war?
2791983 2795111 I grew up after it<br />in the ruins...
2795152 2798315 starving, hiding from HKs.
2798356 2800290 - HKs?<br />- Hunter-Killers...
2801392 2804327 patrol machines<br />built in automated factories.
2805429 2807056 Most of us were rounded up...
2807098 2809623 put in camps<br />for orderly disposal.
2811469 2814131 This was burned in<br />by laser scanner.
2818009 2820341 Some of us were kept alive...
2820378 2823108 to work...
2823147 2824910 loading bodies.
2826150 2828710 The disposal units<br />ran night and day.
2828753 2831881 We were that close<br />to going out forever.
2835059 2838028 But there was one man<br />who taught us to fight...
2838062 2840656 to storm the wire<br />of the camps...
2840698 2845192 to smash those<br />metal motherfuckers into junk.
2845236 2847295 He turned it around.
2847338 2848805 He brought us back<br />from the brink.
2848839 2851569 His name is Connor...
2851609 2853270 John Connor.
2853310 2854743 Your son, Sarah.
2856013 2857674 Your unborn son.
2967491 2968958 Drive!
2999757 3001918 - They'll kill you.<br />- You in the Cadillac!
3001959 3003324 Let me see your hands now!
3006330 3007490 Get out of the car!
3011202 3013534 Drop to your knees!
3013571 3014970 Out of the car.
3015005 3016495 Drop to the ground.
3047338 3049329 Sarah,<br />try to drink some of this.
3052610 3054703 Listen, are you sure it's them?
3054745 3057839 Maybe I should look<br />at the bodies.
3057882 3060043 No. They've been identified.<br />There's no doubt.
3060084 3061949 Oh, God.
3071595 3073620 Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.
3073664 3074858 Hi, Sarah.
3074899 3077629 I want you to tell him<br />everything Reese told you.
3077668 3079033 Do you feel up to that?
3079069 3081162 I guess so.
3082773 3084400 You're a doctor?
3084441 3087001 Criminal psychologist.
3087044 3088375 Is Reese crazy?
3088412 3091982 That's what<br />we're gonna find out.
3176332 3180029 So, you're a soldier,<br />fighting for whom?
3181171 3184197 With the 132nd, under Perry.
3184240 3186936 From 21 to 27.
3186976 3189843 That's the year 2027?
3189879 3191870 That's right.<br />And I was assigned...
3191915 3193348 This is fucking great.
3193383 3195817 ...the last two years<br />under John Connor.
3195852 3197114 Who was the enemy again?
3197153 3200054 A computer defense system<br />built for...
3200090 3201648 Damn. Sorry.
3201691 3205149 Built for SAC-NORAD<br />by Cyberdyne Systems.
3205195 3206662 I see.
3206696 3210325 And this computer<br />thinks it can win...
3210366 3213335 by killing<br />the mother of its enemy.
3213369 3216600 Killing him, in effect,<br />before he's even conceived...
3216639 3218971 a sort of retroactive abortion?
3220176 3222303 That guy Silberman<br />cracks me up.
3222345 3224040 Last week, he had this guy<br />in here that burned his Afghan.
3224080 3225877 Screwed it first,<br />then he set it on fire.
3225915 3226973 Shut up.
3227016 3229177 Why didn't the computer<br />just kill Connor then?
3229219 3231744 Why this elaborate scheme<br />with the Terminator?
3231788 3233346 It had no choice.
3233389 3236256 Their defense grid was smashed.
3236292 3237782 We'd won.
3237827 3240694 Taking out Connor then<br />would make no difference.
3240730 3243756 Skynet had to wipe out<br />his entire existence.
3243800 3245995 Is that when you<br />captured the lab complex...
3246035 3247798 and found that...<br />What is it called?
3247837 3251170 The time displacement equipment?
3251207 3255541 That's right. The Terminator<br />had already gone through.
3255578 3258513 Connor sent me to intercept,<br />and they blew the whole place.
3258548 3260516 How are you supposed get back?
3260550 3262415 I can't.
3264220 3265915 Nobody goes home.
3267924 3270654 Nobody else comes through.
3270693 3274693 It's just him... and me.
3378811 3381644 It's just him... and me.
3384049 3387018 Why didn't you bring<br />any weapons...
3387052 3389953 something more advanced?
3389989 3392651 Don't you have ray guns?
3392691 3394249 Ray guns.
3394293 3396659 Show me a piece<br />of future technology.
3396695 3398560 You go naked.
3398597 3400861 Something about the field<br />generated by a living organism.
3400899 3403493 - Nothing dead will go.<br />- Why?
3403535 3405730 I didn't build<br />the fucking thing!
3405771 3410265 OK. But this cyborg,<br />if it's metal...
3410309 3411571 Surrounded by living tissue!
3411610 3412975 Right.
3413012 3414274 This is great stuff.
3414313 3416281 I could make a career<br />out of this guy.
3416315 3417976 You see how clever<br />this part is?
3418017 3419746 How it doesn't require<br />a shred of proof?
3419785 3421548 Most paranoid delusions<br />are intricate...
3421587 3423521 but this is brilliant.
3423555 3426353 Why were the other<br />two women killed?
3426392 3429156 Most of the records<br />were lost in the war.
3429194 3431719 Skynet knew almost nothing<br />about Connor's mother.
3431764 3435666 Her full name, where she lived.<br />They just knew the city.
3435701 3438135 The Terminator was<br />just being systematic.
3438170 3439762 Well, let's go back to...
3439805 3442899 Look, you have heard enough!<br />I have answered your questions!
3442941 3445000 Now I have to see Sarah Connor!
3445044 3447069 I'm afraid that's not up to me.
3447112 3448704 Then why am I talking to you?
3448747 3450408 Because I can help you.
3450449 3452440 Who is in authority here?<br />Shut up!
3452484 3456045 You still don't get it, do you?
3456088 3457851 He'll find her.
3457890 3459755 That's what he does!
3459792 3461487 That's all he does!
3461527 3463461 You can't stop him!
3463495 3465326 He'll wade through you,<br />reach down her throat...
3465364 3467229 and pull her fucking heart out!
3467266 3468494 Doc.
3468534 3469865 Let go of me...
3472704 3474672 Sorry.
3479878 3481607 So, Reese is crazy?
3481647 3485139 In technical terminology...<br />he's a loon.
3485184 3489553 Sarah, this is what<br />they call body armor.
3489588 3491522 Our TAC guys wear these.
3491557 3493718 It'll stop a 12-gauge round.
3493759 3496227 This other individual must have<br />worn one under his coat.
3496261 3497990 Feel that. Go ahead.
3499832 3501732 What about when he punched<br />through the windshield?
3501767 3503701 He was probably on PCP.
3503735 3506795 Broke every bone in his hand<br />and wouldn't feel it for hours.
3506839 3508602 There was this guy once...<br />See this scar?
3508640 3510835 - Here.<br />- Thank you.
3510876 3512639 There's a couch<br />in this other room.
3512678 3515203 Why don't you stretch out<br />and try to get some sleep?
3515247 3518011 It'll be an hour before your<br />mother gets here from Big Bear.
3518050 3521042 - I can't sleep.<br />- Try.
3521086 3525147 It may not look it, but<br />that couch is very comfortable.
3526225 3528853 You'll be perfectly safe.
3528894 3531761 We got 30 cops in this building.
3531797 3533287 Thank you.
3539671 3541161 Good night.
3556155 3558089 I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
3558123 3560421 I was told that she's here.<br />Could I see her, please?
3560459 3562552 No. You can't see her.<br />She's making a statement.
3562594 3563686 Where is she?
3563729 3565697 Look, it may take a while.
3565731 3567926 If you want to wait,<br />there's a bench over there.
3578810 3580744 I'll be back.
3607139 3610131 What the hell was that?
3618483 3619677 Gunshot!
3628927 3630554 What is it, terrorists?
3630596 3632063 Let's go! Let's go!
3636001 3637662 Stay here.
3651283 3654684 Let's get out of here!<br />Come on!
3654720 3656381 He's got an automatic weapon!
3657856 3659847 Move it, move it!
3670869 3672700 What the hell<br />happened to the lights?
3677542 3679032 Watch him.
3699464 3700726 Automatic weapons!
3700766 3702290 Lock and load! Let's go!
3729894 3731452 Fire! Fire!
3785016 3786483 This way.
3827058 3829026 KFLB Newstime 4:36.
3829060 3831358 In the top story of the hour...
3831396 3834058 the largest single<br />law enforcement mobilization...
3834099 3836533 in California history<br />is currently underway.
3836568 3838160 Police in<br />five southern counties...
3838203 3840296 are engaged in a massive manhunt<br />for an unident...
3843575 3845065 Take this.
3847946 3850574 All right,<br />let's get this off the road.
3881813 3885112 - You cold?<br />- Freezing.
3901399 3903094 You got a first name?
3903134 3905364 Kyle.
3905403 3907428 Kyle...
3907472 3910100 what's it like<br />when you go through time?
3912610 3914100 White light.
3917115 3918605 Pain.
3921119 3923087 It's like being born maybe.
3923121 3925954 Oh, my God.
3925990 3928857 I caught one back there.
3928893 3931760 You mean you got shot?
3931796 3933058 It's not bad.
3933097 3935531 We got to get you to a doctor.
3935567 3937535 It's OK. Forget it.
3937569 3940538 What do you mean, forget it?<br />Are you crazy?
3940572 3942699 Take this off.
3954485 3956350 Jesus.
3956387 3959049 See, it passed<br />right through the meat.
3959090 3961354 This is going to make me puke.
3961392 3963656 Would you talk about something?
3963695 3965060 What?
3965096 3967428 I don't know.<br />Anything. Just talk.
3967465 3969592 Tell me about my son.
3969634 3972603 He's about my height.
3975106 3978098 He has your eyes.
3980945 3983072 What's he like?
3983114 3985582 You trust him.
3985617 3987983 He's got a strength.
3988019 3990817 I'd die for John Connor.
3993057 3997187 Well... at least now<br />I know what to name him.
3997228 4000129 I don't suppose<br />you know who the father is...
4000164 4003031 so I won't tell him<br />to get lost when I meet him.
4003067 4005535 John never said much about him.
4005570 4007538 I know he dies before the war...
4007572 4009062 Wait!
4010575 4012668 I don't want to know.
4012710 4016544 So, was it John<br />that sent you here?
4016581 4018071 I volunteered.
4019083 4020744 Why?
4020785 4024551 It was a chance<br />to meet the legend...
4024589 4026523 Sarah Connor.
4026557 4031756 Taught her son to fight,<br />organize...
4031796 4034060 prepare from when he was a kid.
4034098 4036589 When you were in hiding<br />before the war...
4039604 4042198 You're talking about things<br />I haven't done yet...
4042240 4043639 in the past tense.
4043675 4045973 It's driving me crazy.
4049614 4052515 Are you sure<br />you have the right person?
4052550 4054017 I'm sure.
4054052 4055519 Come on.
4055553 4058351 Do I look like<br />the mother of the future?
4060058 4062526 Am I tough, organized?
4062560 4065051 I can't even<br />balance my checkbook.
4067865 4070891 Look, Reese,<br />I didn't ask for this honor...
4070935 4073563 and I don't want it!<br />Any of it!
4076941 4079501 Your son gave me a message<br />to give to you.
4079544 4081171 Made me memorize it.
4081212 4085308 Thank you, Sarah, for your<br />courage through the dark years.
4085350 4087443 I can't help you with<br />what you must soon face...
4087485 4090079 except to say that<br />the future is not set.
4090121 4092749 You must be stronger<br />than you imagine you can be.
4092790 4096556 You must survive,<br />or I will never exist.
4096594 4098391 That's all.
4100598 4102566 That's a good field dressing.
4104102 4106070 You like it?
4106104 4108402 It's my first.
4111709 4114542 Get some sleep.<br />It will be light soon.
4130561 4132552 Talk to me some more.
4135566 4138034 About what?
4138069 4140560 Tell me about where you're from.
4143074 4144564 All right.
4146077 4148602 You stay down by day...
4148646 4151114 but at night<br />you can move around.
4151149 4154778 You still have to be careful<br />because the HKs use infrared.
4156587 4159522 But they're not too bright.
4159557 4163049 John taught us ways<br />to dust them.
4163093 4166494 That's when the infiltrators<br />started to appear.
4166530 4168259 The Terminators<br />were the newest...
4168299 4169732 the worst.
4179577 4181875 Traversing your sector<br />in search mode.
4181912 4185006 750 meters north<br />of your position.
4185049 4187415 Understand. 750 meters north.
4189053 4190645 Let's go.
4190688 4192519 Intercept. Over.
4192556 4195252 Take it easy.<br />Finish your sweep.
4195292 4197522 They are scavenger teams<br />in that quadrant.
4197561 4199028 Avoid contact.
4199063 4200963 Repeat, avoid contact.
4200998 4202522 We'll get them later.
4202566 4204557 Roger, Echo Leader.
4210608 4212303 Sector niner,<br />what's your status?
4212343 4214072 Situation normal.
4219350 4220544 We're coming in.
4220584 4222575 Roger.
4228092 4233029 Firebase,<br />what's your status? Over.
4235533 4237797 Reese. BN384.
4237835 4239325 Right. Let him in.
4243541 4246510 Any infiltrators<br />at the shopping mall?
4246544 4249513 No problem.<br />They were clean.
4249547 4252516 We're cutting short<br />the patrol. Over.
4252550 4256042 Roger, Yankee-1-7.<br />You are clear to return.
4331028 4333223 Terminator!
4410140 4412404 I was dreaming about dogs.
4413911 4417039 We use them<br />to spot Terminators.
4417081 4419743 Your world is pretty terrifying.
4458622 4462820 Buddy, you got a dead cat<br />in there, or what?
4470234 4472293 Fuck you, asshole.
4491455 4493184 God damn!
4493257 4495691 Thank you.
4500864 4502593 Is this enough?
4502633 4504100 Yeah, it's enough.
4504134 4507035 I don't want to ask<br />where you got it.
4512409 4514274 - I'm coming.<br />- We need a room.
4514311 4516370 - All right.<br />- With a kitchen.
4516413 4518005 Do you have one<br />with a kitchen?
4533597 4536088 I am dying for a shower.
4538101 4540569 We should check<br />your bandage, too.
4540604 4543732 Later. I'm going out<br />for supplies.
4548111 4549942 Keep this.
4575973 4577736 No, I can't tell you<br />where I am, Mom.
4577774 4579742 I was told not to say.
4579776 4581437 Honey, I need to know<br />where I can reach you.
4581478 4584174 You tell me to hide up at<br />the cabin like some fugitive...
4584214 4587149 and you won't tell me<br />what's going on?
4587184 4589084 I am worried sick, dear.
4592656 4593602 Here's the number. Ready?
4593637 4594549 Here's the number. Ready?
4594590 4596558 Yes. Go ahead.
4596592 4601552 It's 408-555-1439.
4601597 4603565 Room nine. Got it?
4603599 4604827 I've got it.
4604867 4606164 I've got to go.
4606202 4609569 I'm sorry I can't<br />tell you more right now.
4609605 4611095 I love you, Mom.
4614610 4617101 I love you, too, sweetheart.
4629225 4631955 - Tiki Motel.<br />- Give me your address.
4635131 4636621 What have we got?
4639635 4641626 Mothballs.
4642972 4645099 Corn syrup.
4645141 4646608 Ammonia.
4646642 4648610 What's for dinner?
4648644 4650111 Plastique.
4650146 4652114 That sounds good.
4652148 4653547 What is it?
4653582 4655550 Nitroglycerin, basically.
4655584 4657552 It's a bit more stable.
4657586 4660111 I learned to make it<br />when I was a kid.
4671901 4675064 Make sure there's none<br />on the threads.
4675104 4677265 Like this.
4679608 4681371 Screw the end cap on.
4683179 4684612 Very gently.
4687483 4690008 You must have had<br />a fun childhood.
4693089 4695557 That's good.
4695591 4697320 All right.<br />Six more like that...
4697360 4699328 and I'll get started<br />on the fuses.
4710806 4712137 He'll find us, won't he?
4715077 4716567 Probably.
4734663 4736597 It'll never be over, will it?
4745608 4748577 Look at me. I'm shaking.
4748611 4751580 Some legend, huh?
4751614 4755072 You must be<br />pretty disappointed.
4755117 4758609 No. I'm not.
4770132 4772532 The women in your time...
4772568 4774559 what are they like?
4777073 4779041 Good fighters.
4779075 4781066 That's not what I meant.
4783612 4785739 Was there someone special?
4787383 4789715 Someone?
4789752 4791583 A girl. You know.
4797593 4799083 Never.
4800596 4802086 Never?
4807369 4808961 I'm sorry.
4809004 4810995 I'm so sorry.
4813476 4816639 So much pain.
4816679 4819375 Pain can be controlled.
4819415 4821610 You just disconnect it.
4821650 4823675 So you feel nothing?
4829024 4831652 John Connor gave me<br />a picture of you once.
4833863 4835728 I didn't know why at the time.
4835764 4838130 It was very old...
4839635 4841762 torn...
4841804 4843294 faded.
4846475 4848739 You were young like you are now.
4848777 4853373 You seemed just a little sad.
4853415 4858352 I always wondered what you<br />were thinking at that moment.
4858387 4862255 I memorized every line...
4862291 4864225 every curve.
4867696 4869857 I came across time<br />for you, Sarah.
4871400 4872890 I love you.
4874436 4876028 I always have.
4893756 4895747 I shouldn't have said that.
4986282 4987943 Think fast!
5077572 5079233 Trade places!
5090285 5093948 Faster! Drive faster!
5144806 5146740 Oh, my God!
5196958 5198391 - Whoa!<br />- Son of a bitch!
5214008 5215737 You stay here.
5239500 5240762 Let's get out of here.
5244272 5245864 Get out.
5262757 5265726 Kyle! Come on! Get up!
5272233 5275430 He's coming! Kyle!
5275470 5276869 Come on!
5277939 5280840 Help me! Get out!
5282310 5283504 Get out!
5292353 5293479 Come on!
5299694 5301252 Faster!
5305166 5307532 Don't stop! Run!
5453114 5455139 We did it, Kyle.
5455182 5456672 We got it.
5534761 5536456 Wait!
5541000 5543468 What are you doing?
5543503 5545903 Cover... so he can't track us.
5556316 5559843 Come on!
5559886 5561353 No, Kyle!
5562488 5564115 Come on!
5564157 5565852 Leave me here.
5565892 5567325 Get up!
5576903 5578928 Move it, Reese!
5578972 5581702 On your feet, soldier!
5581741 5585268 On your feet! Move it!
5657250 5659241 Back. Go back.
5693586 5695781 Run, Sarah.
5695822 5697517 Run!
5702895 5704419 Come on, motherfucker.
5937429 5939761 You're terminated, fucker.
6019711 6022111 Tape 7, November 10.
6022147 6023774 Where was I?
6024983 6027076 What's most difficult for me<br />is trying to decide...
6027119 6029019 what to tell you<br />and what not to.
6029054 6030919 But I guess<br />I have a while yet...
6030956 6033857 before you're old enough<br />to even understand these tapes.
6033892 6035587 They're more for me<br />at this point...
6035627 6038960 just so that<br />I can get it straight.
6074933 6076195 Fill her up.
6079738 6083003 Should I tell you<br />about your father?
6083041 6085202 Boy, that's a tough one.
6086712 6089237 Will it affect your decision<br />to send him here...
6089281 6092182 knowing that he is your father?
6092217 6096153 If you don't send Kyle,<br />you can never be.
6096188 6099715 God, a person could go crazy<br />thinking about this.
6103261 6106196 I suppose I will tell you.
6106231 6108722 I owe him that.
6110736 6113705 Maybe it'll help if...
6113739 6118574 you know that in the few hours<br />that we had together...
6120746 6123544 we loved a lifetime's worth.
6135761 6137729 What did he just say?
6137763 6139731 He says<br />you're very beautiful...
6139765 6141164 and he's ashamed to ask you...
6141199 6143099 for five American dollars<br />for his picture...
6143135 6146730 but if he doesn't,<br />his father will beat him.
6146772 6148399 Pretty good hustle, kid.
6165490 6167390 What did he just say?
6167426 6170224 He said<br />there's a storm coming in.
6174733 6176223 I know.
