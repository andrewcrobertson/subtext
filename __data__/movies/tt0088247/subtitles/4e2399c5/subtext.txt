42400 47560 LOS ANGELES 2029 A.D.
82840 86000 THE MACHINES ROSE FROM THE<br />ASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FIRE.
86120 89680 THEIR WAR TO EXTERMINATE MANKIND<br />HAS RAGED FOR DECADES,
89800 93160 BUT THE FINAL BATTLE WOULD NOT<br />BE FOUGHT IN THE FUTURE.
93280 95840 IT WOULD BE FOUGHT HERE,<br />IN OUR PRESENT.
95960 97920 TONIGHT...
214520 218840 LOS ANGELES 1984<br />1:52a.m.
226760 230560 What the hell...?<br />Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...
245120 247360 What the hell...?
298440 300400 Hey, my turn.
308320 311880 Hey, what's wrong with this picture?

326080 328320 Nice night for a walk.
328440 332280 Wash day tomorrow.<br />Nothing clean, right?
332400 334160 Nothing clean. Right.
334280 337240 I think this guy's a couple of cans<br />short of a six-pack.
337360 340440 Your clothes, give them to me.
340560 343360 - Now.<br />- Fuck you, asshole.
442800 446760 Hey, buddy, did you just see<br />a real bright light?
449280 451840 - See that guy?<br />- Hold it right there.
451960 455360 - He's rabbiting.<br />- Hey! I said hold it! Go.
456560 459360 That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.
501520 504440 - What day is it? The date.<br />- 12th May.
504560 507400 - Thursday.<br />- What year?
519480 521040 He's got my gun. Let's go.

694800 696760 Hi. I'm late.
697760 699720 So am I.
740800 742760 - I'm in it.<br />- So am I.
748320 751880 - Honey, can I have that coffee now?<br />- Yes, sir.
752000 754640 - OK. Who gets the burly-beef?<br />- I ordered barbecued.
754760 756760 That's mine, but I didn't order fries.
756880 760080 - Mine's the chilli beef deluxe.<br />- Who gets the burly-beef?
760200 762960 - We're ready to order now.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
764400 766360 I'm so sorry.
769320 771280 This isn't real leather, is it?
774240 777400 Nice going, kid.<br />I ought to give you the tip.
779480 783040 Look at it this way.<br />In 100 years, who's gonna care?
790080 792440 The 12-gauge auto-loader.
794280 798240 That's ltalian. You can go pump or auto.
798920 801680 The 45 long slide with laser sighting.
801800 805120 These are new. We just got them in.<br />That's a good gun.
805800 809320 The beam comes on - you put the red dot<br />where you want the bullet to go.
809440 811400 You can't miss.
812720 816720 - Anything else?<br />- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.
816840 819400 Hey, just what you see, pal.
819520 822040 The Uzi nine millimetre.
822160 824520 You know your weapons, buddy.
824640 827800 Any one of these is ideal<br />for home defence.
827920 830720 So which will it be?
830840 834280 - All.<br />- I may close early today.
834400 838520 It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,<br />but the rifles you can take now.
839560 841560 - You can't do that.<br />- Wrong.
867360 870040 Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.
870160 874200 Listen, I need you to come pick me up.<br />My bike just broke down.
874320 877480 I don't care what you're doing.<br />Come and get me. What the...?
878080 882240 Hey, man, you got<br />a serious attitude problem.
933120 935400 - Sarah Connor?<br />- Yes?
947560 950000 I'm on my break, Chuck.<br />Carla's got my station.
950120 953680 Sarah, come here. It's about you.<br />I mean, sort of.
955720 960080 Incredible. You're not gonna believe this.<br />You're going to love this.
960920 963920 - What?<br />- ..compiled from several witnesses.
964040 967200 Once again, Sarah Connor,<br />35, mother oftwo,
967320 969640 brutally shot to death this afternoon.
969760 971920 You're dead, honey.
1156880 1158920 ..if you're into sound,
1159040 1163200 for the greatest sound around,<br />come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.
1163320 1167280 We've got woofers, tweeters,<br />the newest in audio and compact discs.
1167400 1170640 We've got graphic equalisers<br />and sound balancers that...
1193040 1194760 Sorry.
1206280 1207840 Hello?
1207960 1212000 First I'm gonna rip the buttons<br />off your blouse one by one,
1212120 1216280 then run my tongue down your neck<br />to your bare, gleaming breasts.
1216400 1221560 And then slowly... slowly pull<br />yourjeans offinch by inch.
1223200 1224760 Ginger, it's Matt.
1224880 1228840 And lick your belly in circles<br />further and further down,
1228960 1232080 and then pull your panties off<br />with my teeth.
1232200 1234600 Who is this?
1234720 1236800 God. Sarah?
1238280 1240760 Jesus. I'm sorry.
1240880 1243400 I thought you were...<br />Can I talk to Ginger?
1243520 1244920 Sure.
1247440 1249400 It's the creep.
1250680 1251640 Hello?
1251760 1255120 First I'll rip the buttons off<br />your blouse one by one...
1256800 1261760 You fucking pigs. Wait till I get<br />my hands on you. Get off me.
1263600 1265560 Ed.
1266920 1268880 - What have you got?<br />- Dead girl.
1269000 1272480 - I can see that.<br />- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.
1272600 1276160 Shot six times at less than 10 feet.<br />Large calibre weapon.
1276280 1278240 You know, these work.
1279520 1282040 - What's this?<br />- Dead girl two.
1282160 1285320 Sent over from the Valley division<br />this afternoon.
1286360 1289120 Are you sure there's a point to all of this?
1289240 1291520 Look at the name, Ed.
1291640 1295200 Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?
1296920 1298080 You're kidding.
1298200 1300720 The press is gonna be short-stroking it.
1300840 1305040 - A one-day pattern killer.<br />- I hate the weird ones.
1309240 1311200 So...
1312480 1314920 Better than mortal man deserves.
1321760 1325920 - Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?<br />- Not lately. Did you check messages?
1326040 1328320 I thought you did.
1332400 1336240 - Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...<br />- There you are, young man.
1336360 1338520 You mind your mother.
1342160 1345480 Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.<br />Something's come up.
1345600 1349200 Looks like I won't be able to make it<br />tonight. Just can't get out ofit.
1349320 1353840 I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.<br />Call you in a day or so. Bye.
1355520 1358480 That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?
1358600 1363080 He can't treat you like this.<br />It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.
1363200 1365160 I'll live.
1365280 1367440 I'll break his kneecaps.
1368040 1371760 Well, Pugsley still loves me.<br />Don't you, baby?
1373160 1375280 God. It's disgusting.
1377400 1379960 I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.<br />Have a good time.
1380080 1382880 - We will. You, too.<br />- OK.
1387000 1388960 Damn it, Matt.
1443280 1445240 Shit.
1445360 1449320 These killings occurred in the order<br />of their listings in the phone book.
1449440 1452640 - What can I tell you? No comment.<br />- But, Lieutenant...
1464320 1466680 That coffee's two hours cold.
1467600 1470040 I put a cigarette out in it.
1470160 1473520 - Did you reach the next girl yet?<br />- No. I got her answering machine.
1473640 1476080 - Send a unit.<br />- I sent a unit. There's no answer.
1476200 1478440 - The apartment manager's not in.<br />- Call her.
1478560 1481320 - I just called her.<br />- Call her again.
1481440 1483400 Give me a cigarette.
1492960 1497720 Hi, there. Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.
1497840 1501760 But don't be shy. It's OK.<br />Machines need love, too, so talk to it...
1507320 1509280 Same shit.
1510160 1513840 I can hear it now. He's gonna be<br />called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
1513960 1518960 I hate these press cases.<br />Especially the weird press cases.
1520400 1522960 - Where are you going?<br />- To make a statement.
1523080 1525040 Maybe make these jackals work for us.
1525160 1529760 If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,<br />maybe she'll call us.
1529880 1532400 Well, how do I look?
1532520 1535720 - Like shit, boss.<br />- Your mama.
1536840 1539840 This just in. Police have announced<br />the name ofthe victim
1539960 1543320 in the second oftwo murders<br />which took place today.
1543440 1547680 Incredibly, the names ofthe<br />two victims are virtually identical.
1547800 1552760 Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann<br />Connor was pronounced dead...
1552880 1555040 - Can we change this?<br />- Sarah Louise...
1555160 1557560 Don't touch it.
1558640 1562920 Police are refusing to speculate on the<br />similarity between the shooting deaths
1563040 1567160 and no other connection between<br />the two victims has been established yet.
1567280 1570920 We'll have more on this<br />late-breaking story as it comes in.
1657920 1660080 - Hey, you got a phone?<br />- It's in the back.
1660200 1662560 Hey. Four-fifty.
1700120 1703280 You have reached the Los Angeles<br />Police emergency number.
1703400 1707960 All lines are busy. Ifyou need a police car<br />sent out to you, stay on the line.
1770880 1773520 Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.
1787760 1790720 Don't make me bust you up, man.
1847520 1851200 Hi, there. Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.
1851320 1854160 But don't be shy. It's OK.<br />Machines need love, too.
1854280 1858200 So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,<br />or Sarah will get back to you.
1858320 1860760 Wait for the beep.
1860880 1863120 This is Sarah. Pick up ifyou're there.
1863240 1868800 I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard<br />called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.
1868920 1873760 I think that there's somebody after me.<br />I hope that you play this back soon.
1873880 1877320 I need you and Matt to come<br />and pick me up as soon as possible.
1877440 1880680 The police keep transferring me.<br />I'm gonna give 'em another try.
1880800 1886840 The number here is 555 9175.<br />Call me, kiddo. I need your help.
1903440 1904400 It's her.
1905720 1907880 Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.
1908000 1911200 Don't put me on hold.<br />Don't transfer me to another department.
1911320 1913480 I won't. Can you tell me where you are?
1913600 1917400 - I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.<br />- I know it. It's on Pico.
1917520 1920080 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.
1920200 1924160 - I think there's a guy following me.<br />- Now, listen carefully.
1924280 1928880 You're in a public place so you'll be safe.<br />Stay visible. Don't go outside.
1929000 1931960 - I'll have a car there in a minute.<br />- OK.
1954920 1956880 Hey, that guy didn't pay.
2110160 2113320 Come with me if you wanna live.
2121080 2123040 Come on!
2191800 2194400 This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.
2194520 2198680 Suspect vehicle - Iate model<br />grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.
2198800 2200880 He's really moving - punching lights.
2201000 2205560 I'm gonna need an ambulance<br />at Seventh and Broadway right now.
2205680 2207840 Hold it.
2223480 2225680 Hold on.
2235920 2239800 Are you injured? Are you shot?
2244720 2248080 Do exactly what I say. Exactly.
2248200 2251560 Don't move unless I say.<br />Don't make a sound unless I say.
2251680 2253880 Do you understand?
2254000 2258360 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes. Please don't hurt me.
2274840 2276600 I'm here to help you.
2276720 2281200 I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.<br />DN38416. Assigned to protect you.
2281320 2283560 You've been targeted for termination.
2292600 2297360 This is one-L-19. Westbound<br />on Olympic. Approaching Overland.
2301280 2304640 This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.
2304760 2308320 No, but you will.<br />It's very important that you live.
2308440 2311800 This isn't true. How could that man<br />just get up after you...
2311920 2314720 It's not a man. A machine.
2314840 2318200 A Terminator.<br />Cyberdyne Systems model 101.
2326000 2329880 A machine? Like a robot?
2330000 2334360 Not a robot. A cyborg -<br />cybernetic organism.
2334480 2337200 - No. He was bleeding.<br />- Just a second.
2340520 2342800 Get your head down.
2384640 2389320 Listen. The Terminator's an infiltration<br />unit. Part man, part machine.
2390000 2394160 Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat<br />chassis. Microprocessor controlled.
2394280 2398560 Fully armoured, very tough.<br />Outside it's living human tissue.
2398680 2402840 Flesh, skin, hair, blood -<br />grown for the cyborgs.
2402960 2405680 - Look, Reese, I don't know...<br />- Pay attention.
2405800 2408160 I gotta ditch this car.
2412160 2416120 The 600-Series had rubber skin.<br />We spotted them easy.
2416240 2418640 But these are new. They look human.
2418760 2422440 Sweat, bad breath, everything.<br />Very hard to spot.
2422560 2426000 I had to wait till he moved on you<br />before I could zero him.
2426120 2431560 Look, I am not stupid.<br />They cannot make things like that yet.
2431680 2435440 Not yet. Not for about forty years.
2437760 2439920 Are you saying it's from the future?
2440040 2443600 One possible future...<br />from your point of view.
2443720 2446720 I don't know tech stuff.
2446840 2449480 Then you're from the future, too.<br />Is that right?
2449600 2451560 - Right.<br />- Right.
2459400 2464560 Cyborgs don't feel pain.<br />I do. Don't do that again.
2464680 2468520 - Just let me go.<br />- Listen and understand.
2468640 2471000 That Terminator is out there.
2472200 2475840 It can't be bargained with,<br />it can't be reasoned with.
2476440 2480480 It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear
2480600 2486320 and it absolutely will not stop,<br />ever, until you are dead.
2496000 2498760 Can you stop it?
2501880 2503840 I don't know.
2504800 2507160 With these weapons, I don't know.
2522960 2527240 All units. Ford suspect vehicle has<br />been found in a parking structure...
2568880 2573240 Reese, why me?
2575240 2577800 Why does it want me?
2583040 2585480 There was a nuclear war.
2587000 2589160 A few years from now,
2591200 2596600 all this, this whole place, everything,
2596720 2601120 it's gone, just gone.
2601880 2603840 There were survivors.
2603960 2605920 Here, there.
2608480 2611440 Nobody even knew who started it.
2613520 2618120 - It was the machines, Sarah.<br />- I don't understand.
2618240 2620680 Defence network computers.
2621400 2624360 New, powerful,
2625480 2630040 hooked into everything,<br />trusted to run it all.
2630160 2634520 They say it got smart -<br />a new order of intelligence.
2636120 2641080 Then it saw all people as a threat.<br />Not just the ones on the other side.
2641200 2643960 It decided our fate in a microsecond.
2645400 2647360 Extermination.
2660960 2663120 Did you see this war?
2674360 2679000 No. I grew up after. In the ruins.
2679120 2682080 Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.
2682200 2684960 - H-Ks?<br />- Hunter-killers.
2685080 2688840 Patrol machines<br />built in automated factories.
2688960 2693400 Most of us were rounded up.<br />Put in camps for orderly disposal.
2694720 2697240 This was burned in by laser scanner.
2700960 2704920 Some of us were kept alive. To work.
2706080 2708520 Loading bodies.
2708640 2711200 The disposal units ran night and day.
2711320 2714280 We were that close to going out for ever.
2717400 2720760 But there was one man<br />who taught us to fight.
2720880 2722840 To storm the wire of the camps.
2722960 2726400 To smash those metal<br />motherfuckers into junk.
2727600 2730480 He turned it around.<br />He brought us back from the brink.
2730600 2734760 His name was Connor. John Connor.
2734880 2739320 Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.
2844640 2846280 Drive.
2852320 2854920 Reese!
2872360 2875680 No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.
2875800 2879440 You in the Cadillac,<br />let me see your hands now.
2881800 2884160 Get out of the car.
2886520 2888480 Drop to your knees.
2888600 2891760 - Out of the car.<br />- Drop to the ground.
2918960 2923120 Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.
2925760 2927720 Listen, are you sure it's them?
2927840 2930720 I mean,<br />maybe I should look at the bodies.
2930840 2934880 No. They've been identified<br />and there's no doubt.
2937360 2941760 Ginger. Kiddo.
2942240 2947280 - Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.<br />- Hi, Sarah.
2947400 2951280 Tell him everything Reese told you,<br />Sarah. Do you feel up to that?
2951400 2953360 Yeah, I guess so.
2955120 2958920 - You're a doctor?<br />- Criminal psychologist.
2959040 2963640 - Is Reese crazy?<br />- That's what we're gonna find out.
3044680 3048240 So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
3049360 3054680 With the 132nd under Perry.<br />From '21 to '27.
3054800 3057480 That's the year 2027?
3057600 3059560 That's right. Then I was assigned...
3059680 3063320 - This is fucking great.<br />- ..under John Connor.
3063440 3066400 - Who was the enemy?<br />- A computer defence system...
3066520 3068720 Goddamn! Sorry.
3068840 3072200 ..built for SAC-NORAD<br />by Cyberdyne Systems.
3072320 3074280 I see.
3074400 3079960 And this computer thinks it can win<br />by killing the mother of its enemy.
3080080 3083240 Killing him, in effect,<br />before he's even conceived.
3083360 3085520 A sort of retroactive abortion?
3086960 3090320 Silberman cracks me up.<br />Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
3090440 3092440 - He screwed it first...<br />- Ed, shut up.
3092560 3095120 Why didn't the computer<br />just kill Connor then?
3095240 3097680 Why this elaborate scheme<br />with the Terminator?
3097800 3102080 It had no choice.<br />Their defence grid was smashed.
3102200 3106400 We'd won. Taking out Connor then<br />would make no difference.
3106520 3109320 Skynet had to wipe out<br />his entire existence.
3109440 3114040 Is that when you captured the lab<br />complex and found... What is it called?
3114160 3116520 The time displacement equipment?
3116640 3120320 That's right. The Terminator<br />had already gone through.
3120440 3123360 Connor sent me to intercept<br />and they blew the whole place.
3123480 3126040 Well, how are you supposed to get back?
3126160 3128120 I can't.
3129160 3134120 Nobody goes home.<br />Nobody else comes through.
3135240 3138600 It's just him and me.
3238720 3241160 It's just him and me.
3244080 3249000 Why didn't you bring any weapons?<br />Something more advanced.
3249120 3251880 Don't you have ray guns?
3252000 3255400 - Ray guns.<br />- Show me a piece of future technology.
3255520 3260000 You go naked. Something about the<br />field generated by a living organism.
3260120 3263680 Nothing dead will go.<br />I didn't build the fucking thing.
3263800 3268120 OK, OK. But this cyborg, ifit's metal... ?
3268240 3271600 - Surrounded by living tissue.<br />- Oh, right.
3271720 3274440 Great stuff.<br />I could make a career out of this guy.
3274560 3277400 See how clever it is?<br />It doesn't require a shred of proof.
3277520 3281960 Most paranoid delusions are intricate,<br />but this is brilliant.
3282920 3286600 - Why were the other women killed?<br />- Records were lost in the war.
3286720 3289280 Skynet knew almost nothing<br />about Connor's mother.
3289400 3292960 Her full name, where she lived.<br />Theyjust knew the city.
3293080 3295840 The Terminator was<br />just being systematic.
3295960 3298640 - Let's go back...<br />- Look, you have heard enough.
3298760 3301960 I have answered your questions.<br />I have to see Sarah Connor.
3302080 3305760 - I'm afraid that's not up to me.<br />- Then why am I talking to you?
3305880 3307840 - Who is in authority here?<br />- Please...
3307960 3309920 Shut up!
3310040 3312600 You still don't get it, do you?
3312720 3317760 He'll find her. That's what he does.<br />That's all he does.
3317880 3323240 You can't stop him. He'll reach down<br />her throat and pull her fucking heart out!
3323360 3325760 - Doc.<br />- Let go ofme!
3329880 3331840 Sorry.
3335480 3337040 He's crazy?
3337160 3340440 In technical terminology, he's a loon.
3341120 3346280 Sarah, this is what they call body armour.<br />Our TAC guys wear these.
3346400 3348560 It'll stop a 12-gauge round.
3348680 3352760 This other man must've been wearing<br />one under his coat. Feel that.
3354560 3358320 - He punched through the windshield.<br />- He was probably on PCP.
3358440 3361040 Broke every bone in his hand.<br />He wouldn't feel it.
3361160 3363520 There was this guy once...<br />You see this scar?
3363640 3365600 Thank you.
3365720 3369160 There's a couch in this other room.<br />Stretch out and get some sleep.
3369280 3371720 Be at least an hour<br />before your mother gets here.
3371840 3374880 - I can't sleep.<br />- Try.
3375000 3378960 It may not look it,<br />but that couch is very comfortable.
3380240 3384200 You'll be perfectly safe.<br />We got 30 cops in this building.
3385240 3387200 Thank you.
3392760 3394720 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
3408600 3412120 I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.<br />I was told she's here. Could I see her?
3412240 3414680 No. Can't see her.<br />She's making a statement.
3414800 3416360 Where is she?
3416480 3421040 It make take a while. If you wanna wait,<br />there's a bench over there.
3430320 3432120 I'll be back.
3485440 3487400 Stay here.
3525080 3527040 Watch him.
3591520 3593280 Ed...
3620400 3622960 Sarah!
3623080 3625040 Reese.
3628040 3629400 This way.
3668480 3670880 KFLB news time. 4.36.
3670960 3674120 Top story - the largest single<br />law enforcement mobilisation
3674240 3677200 in California history<br />is currently underway.
3677320 3681040 Police in five counties are engaged<br />in a massive manhunt for...
3684360 3686320 Take this.
3688640 3691200 All right. Let's get this off the road.
3720880 3724000 - You cold?<br />- Freezing.
3737240 3739200 Reese?
3740080 3742440 - You got a first name?<br />- Kyle.
3743760 3747920 Kyle, what's it like<br />when you go through time?
3750600 3752560 White light.
3754680 3756640 Pain.
3759200 3763160 - It's like being born maybe.<br />- My God.
3764000 3765960 I caught one back there.
3767320 3770040 - You mean you got shot?<br />- It's not bad.
3770840 3774400 - We gotta get you to a doctor.<br />- It's OK. Forget it.
3774520 3779240 What do you mean, forget it?<br />Are you crazy? Take this off.
3790720 3792480 Jesus.
3792600 3795080 See? It passed right through the meat.
3795200 3797520 This is gonna make me puke.
3797640 3800680 - Would you just talk about something?<br />- What?
3800800 3805160 I don't know. Anything.<br />Just talk. Tell me about my son.
3805960 3807920 He's about my height.
3811000 3813160 He has your eyes.
3816120 3818080 What's he like?
3818200 3821760 You trust him. He's got a strength.
3823360 3825400 I'd die for John Connor.
3828080 3831520 Well, at least now I know<br />what to name him.
3832640 3837200 Don't suppose you know who the father is<br />so I won't tell him to get lost?
3837320 3840080 John never said much about him.
3840200 3843160 - I know he dies before the war...<br />- Wait.
3844560 3847120 I don't wanna know.
3847240 3850520 So was it John that sent you here?
3850640 3853200 I volunteered.
3853320 3857960 - Why?<br />- It was a chance to meet the legend.
3858080 3864640 Sarah Connor,<br />who taught her son to fight, organise,
3864760 3866840 prepare from when he was a kid.
3866960 3870520 When you were in hiding before the war.
3872840 3876160 You're talking about things<br />I haven't done yet in the past tense.
3876280 3878720 It's driving me crazy.
3881880 3884240 Are you sure you have the right person?
3884360 3886440 I'm sure.
3886560 3890320 Come on! Do I look like<br />the mother of the future?
3892040 3896800 I mean, am I tough? Organised?<br />I can't even balance my chequebook.
3899800 3903560 Look, Reese, I didn't ask<br />for this honour and I don't want it.
3903680 3905920 Any of it.
3908000 3912920 Your son gave me a message<br />to give to you. Made me memorise it.
3913040 3916000 Thank you, Sarah,<br />for your courage through the dark years.
3916120 3920600 I can't help you with what you must<br />soon face. The future is not set.
3920720 3923160 You must be stronger than<br />you imagine you can be.
3923280 3926480 You must survive or I will never exist.
3926600 3928560 That's all.
3931280 3933960 It's a good field dressing.
3934080 3936040 You like it?
3936160 3938320 It's my first.
3941720 3944280 Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.
3948160 3950080 OK.
3959520 3961680 Talk to me some more.
3964480 3966880 About what?
3967000 3969560 Tell me about where you're from.
3971480 3973440 All right.
3974760 3979120 You stay down by day,<br />but at night you can move around.
3979240 3984200 You still have to be careful<br />because the H-Ks use infrared.
3984880 3990240 But they're not too bright.<br />John taught us ways to dust them.
3991080 3993640 That's when the infiltrators<br />started to appear.
3993760 3997320 The Terminators were the newest.<br />The worst.
4006520 4011680 Traversing your sector in search mode.<br />750 metres north ofyour position.
4016040 4018000 Let's go.
4060680 4063720 - Reese. DN384...<br />- Right. Let him in.
4152080 4154760 Terminator!
4228160 4231160 I was dreaming about dogs.
4231280 4234240 We use 'em to spot Terminators.
4234960 4238080 Your world is pretty terrifying.
4274440 4278200 Hey, buddy,<br />you got a dead cat in there or what?
4285280 4287240 Fuck you, asshole.
4305440 4307200 God damn.
4308040 4309600 Thank you.
4314760 4316760 Is this enough?
4316880 4320840 Yeah, it's enough.<br />I don't wanna ask where you got it.
4325880 4327840 - I'm coming.<br />- We need a room.
4327960 4330960 - With a kitchen.<br />- Do you have one with a kitchen?
4346520 4348880 I am dying for a shower.
4350600 4353160 We should check your bandage, too.
4353280 4356720 Later. I'm going out for supplies.
4360440 4362400 Keep this.
4386320 4389720 No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.<br />I was told not to say.
4389840 4391840 I need to know where to reach you.
4391960 4396960 You tell me to hide out at the cabin<br />and you won't tell me what's going on?
4397080 4399240 I am worried sick here.
4400000 4403720 OK. OK, here's the number.
4403840 4406040 - You ready?<br />- Yes. Go ahead.
4406160 4412440 It's 408 555 1439. Room nine.
4412560 4414360 - Got it?<br />- I've got it.
4414480 4418680 I gotta go. I'm sorry<br />I can't tell you more right now.
4418800 4420760 I love you, Mom.
4423760 4426320 I love you, too, sweetheart.
4437800 4440240 - Tiki Motel.<br />- Give me your address there.
4443760 4445720 What have we got?
4448320 4454120 Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.
4454240 4456400 What's for dinner?
4456520 4459560 - Plastique.<br />- That sounds good.
4459680 4461640 What is it?
4461760 4465200 It's a nitroglycerin base.<br />It's a bit more stable.
4465320 4468080 I learned to make it when I was a kid.
4478640 4481200 Make sure there's none on the threads.
4482680 4484640 Like this.
4486040 4488200 Screw the end cap on.
4489640 4491800 Very gently.
4493760 4496120 You must've had a fun childhood.
4499560 4501320 That's good.
4501440 4506200 All right. Six more like that<br />and I'll get started on the fuses.
4515920 4518280 He'll find us, won't he?
4520440 4522400 Probably.
4539080 4541640 It'll never be over, will it?
4549280 4551440 Look at me. I'm shaking.
4552440 4557400 Some legend.<br />You must be pretty disappointed.
4558400 4561960 No, I'm not.
4570560 4574560 Kyle, the women in your time,
4575680 4577840 what are they like?
4579680 4581640 Good fighters.
4581760 4584320 That's not what I meant.
4585840 4588200 Was there someone special?
4589600 4591360 Someone...?
4591480 4593640 A girl, you know.
4595080 4597040 No.
4599280 4601240 Never.
4602280 4604240 Never?
4608600 4611760 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
4614800 4616760 So much pain.
4617880 4622160 Pain can be controlled.<br />You just disconnect it.
4622720 4625480 So you feel nothing?
4629480 4632440 John Connor gave me<br />a picture of you once.
4634040 4637000 I didn't know why at the time.
4637120 4642880 It was very old, torn, faded.
4646400 4652640 You were young like you are now.<br />You seemed just a little sad.
4653680 4657680 I used to always wonder<br />what you were thinking at that moment.
4657800 4661160 I memorised every line,
4661280 4663240 every curve.
4666480 4670160 I came across time for you, Sarah.
4670280 4674320 I love you. I always have.
4691480 4693840 I shouldn't have said that.
4780440 4783000 Think fast.
4867920 4869880 Trade places.
4879800 4883280 Faster. Drive faster.
4930880 4933920 Kyle. Oh, my God.
4998760 5001120 You stay here.
5023000 5024960 Let's get outta here.
5027640 5029800 Get out.
5045280 5048080 Kyle. Come on. Get up.
5057480 5058800 Come on.
5059840 5062600 Help me. Get out. Get out.
5085760 5088160 Don't stop. Run.
5214960 5217120 Sarah.
5217240 5219000 Kyle.
5228040 5231000 We did it, Kyle. We got him.
5249800 5250960 No.
5306320 5307760 Wait.
5312120 5314440 What are you doing?
5314560 5316800 Cover, so he can't track us.
5326880 5329240 Come on.
5330120 5333560 No. Kyle. Come on.
5334320 5337360 - Come on.<br />- Leave me here.
5346680 5351120 Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.
5351240 5354560 On your feet. Move it.
5423680 5425640 Get back. Go back.
5458600 5460400 - Run, Sarah.<br />- No.
5460520 5462200 Run.
5465320 5467080 Run.
5467200 5469720 Come on, motherfucker.
5577560 5579320 No.
5693120 5695280 You're terminated, fucker.
5750320 5752280 Kyle.
5771960 5775320 Seven. November 10. Where was l?
5776480 5780120 What's difficult is trying to decide<br />what to tell you and what not to.
5780600 5784760 But I guess I have a while before you're<br />old enough to understand these tapes.
5784880 5789640 They're more for me at this point<br />just so that I can get it straight.
5824120 5826080 Fill her up.
5829360 5831880 Should I tell you about your father?
5832000 5834160 Boy, that's a tough one.
5835600 5841040 Will it effect your decision to send him<br />here, knowing that he is your father?
5841960 5844720 If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.
5844840 5847800 God, a person could go crazy<br />thinking about this.
5851360 5854640 I suppose I will tell you.
5854760 5856920 I owe him that.
5859000 5861360 Maybe it'll help if...
5861480 5866440 you know that in the few hours<br />that we had together,
5868160 5870760 we loved a lifetime's worth.
5882840 5886440 - What did he just say?<br />- He says you're very beautiful.
5886560 5889520 He is ashamed to ask you<br />for five dollars for this picture.
5889640 5892840 But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.
5892960 5895840 Pretty good hustle, kid.
5911320 5913440 What did he just say?
5913560 5916520 He said there's a storm coming in.
5919880 5921840 I know.
