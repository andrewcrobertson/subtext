332625 333960 Nice night for a walk.
335044 339298 Wash day tomorrow.<br />Nothing clean, right?
339465 341008 Nothing clean. Right.
341175 344220 I think this guy's<br />a couple of cans short of a six-pack.
344387 349058 Your clothes, give them to me. Now.

720054 721680 So am I.
764890 767184 - I'm in it.<br />- So am I.
773023 775901 - Honey, can I have that coffee now?<br />- Yes, sir.
776986 779446 - OK. Who gets the burly-beef?<br />- I ordered barbecued.
779613 781657 I think that's mine,<br />but I didn't order fries.
781824 784535 - (woman) Mine's the chili beef deluxe.<br />- OK, who gets the burly-beef?
784702 787371 - Miss, we're ready to order now.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
787538 789623 - Ah!<br />- Oh!
789790 791542 I'm so sorry.
794712 796588 This isn't real leather, is it?
799883 803053 (man) Nice going, kid.<br />I ought to give you the tip.
805347 808225 Look at it this way.<br />In 100 years, who's gonna care?
816608 818777 (man) The 12-gauge auto-loader.
820904 824783 That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.
825743 828495 The .45 long slide with laser sighting.
828662 831957 These are new. We just got them in.<br />That's a good gun.
832666 834418 Just touch the trigger,<br />the beam comes on,
834585 836420 and you put the red dot where<br />you want the bullet to go.
836587 838088 You can't miss.
840090 844094 - Anything else?<br />- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.
844261 845888 Hey, just what you see, pal.
847181 848432 The Uzi nine millimeter.
849975 852227 You know your weapons, buddy.
852394 854563 Any one of these<br />is ideal for home defense.
855773 858776 So which will it be?
858942 862446 - All.<br />- I may close early today.
862613 866950 It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,<br />but the rifles you can take now.
868118 870120 - You can't do that.<br />- Wrong.
895896 897022 (tires screech)
897189 899942 (man) Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.
900109 904405 Listen, I need you to come pick me up.<br />My bike just broke down.
904571 906740 I don't care what you're doing.<br />Come and get me. What the...?
906907 908659 (woman speaks indistinctly on phone)
908826 912621 (man) Hey, man, you got<br />a serious attitude problem.
917751 920546 (woman continues speaking on phone)
943026 945195 (dog barking)
965716 968051 - Sarah Connor?<br />- Yes?
980689 983108 I'm on my break, Chuck.<br />Carla's got my station.
983275 986653 Sarah, come here.<br />It's about you. I mean, sort of.
989198 993327 So incredible. You're not gonna<br />believe this. Sit, you're going to love this.
993494 994453 Sh!
994620 997748 - What?<br />- ...compiled from several witnesses.
997915 1001084 Once again, Sarah Connor,<br />35, mother of two,
1001251 1003587 brutally shot to death<br />in her home this afternoon.
1003754 1005547 You're dead, honey.

1201118 1205455 for the greatest sound around,<br />come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.
1205622 1209835 We've got woofers, tweeters,<br />the newest in audio and compact discs.
1210001 1212421 We've got graphic equalizers<br />and sound balancers that...
1230188 1232899 (rock music plays on headphones)
1236862 1238321 Sorry.
1244077 1246329 (phone rings)
1250500 1252169 Hello?
1252335 1256381 (man on phone) First I'm gonna rip<br />the buttons off your blouse one by one,
1256548 1260969 then run my tongue down your neck<br />to your bare, gleaming breasts.
1261136 1266850 And then slowly... slowly pull<br />your jeans of finch by inch.
1267601 1269770 (laughs) Ginger, it's Matt.
1269936 1273857 And lick your belly in circles<br />further and further down,
1274024 1277277 and then pull your panties off<br />with my teeth.
1277444 1278737 Who is this?
1280363 1282199 God. Sarah?
1282365 1283700 (giggles)
1283867 1286119 Jesus. I'm sorry.
1286286 1289080 I thought you were...<br />Can I talk to Ginger, please?
1289831 1290707 Sure.
1290874 1292876 Oh! (humming)
1293460 1295045 it's the creep.
1296713 1297714 Hello?
1297881 1301301 First I'll rip the buttons off<br />your blouse one by one...
1301468 1303178 (yelling)
1303345 1308350 You fucking pigs! Wait till I get<br />my hands on you. Get off me!
1310352 1311603 Ed.
1313897 1315941 - What have you got?<br />- Dead girl.
1316107 1319611 - I can see that.<br />- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.
1319778 1323615 Shot six times at less than ten feet.<br />Large caliber weapon.
1323782 1325575 You know, these work.
1326952 1329621 - What's this?<br />- Dead girl two.
1329788 1332457 Sent over from the Valley division<br />this afternoon.
1334209 1336711 Are you sure there's<br />a point to all of this?
1336878 1338880 Look at the name, Ed.
1339631 1343218 Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?
1344928 1346096 You're kidding me.
1346263 1348849 The press is gonna be short-stroking it.
1349015 1353353 - A one-day pattern killer. Hm.<br />- I hate the weird ones.
1357983 1359818 - So...<br />- (both laugh)
1361278 1363613 Better than mortal man deserves.
1370912 1375250 - Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?<br />- Not lately. Did you check messages?
1375417 1376793 I thought you did.
1376960 1378670 (answering machine rewinding)
1382090 1385886 - Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...<br />- There you are, young man.
1386052 1388221 You mind your mother.
1392350 1395979 (man) Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.<br />Something's come up.
1396146 1399399 Looks like I won't be able to make it<br />tonight. Just can't get out of it.
1399566 1404321 I'm really sorry. I'll make it up<br />to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.
1406072 1409492 That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?
1409659 1413121 He can't treat you like this.<br />It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.
1414205 1416207 I'll live.
1416374 1418460 I'll break his kneecaps.
1419169 1423548 Well, Pugsley still loves me.<br />Don't you, baby?
1424466 1426760 God. it's disgusting.
1429012 1431556 I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.<br />Have a good time.
1431723 1434643 - We will. You, too.<br />- OK.
1436937 1438521 (gasps)
1438688 1440815 Damn it, Matt.
1469302 1472347 (engine revving)
1478812 1481147 (car engine starts)
1497580 1500333 - Oh, shit.<br />- (man) Lieutenant!
1500500 1504004 These killings occurred in the order<br />of their listings in the phone book.
1504170 1507007 - What can I tell you? No comment.<br />- But, Lieutenant...
1507173 1508800 (reporters clamoring)
1519561 1522731 - That coffee's two hours cold.<br />- Mm-hm.
1522897 1524816 I put a cigarette out in it.
1525984 1529320 - Did you reach the next girl yet?<br />- No. I got her answering machine.
1529487 1531781 - Send a unit.<br />- I sent a unit. There's no answer.
1531948 1534117 - The apartment manager's not in.<br />- Call her.
1534284 1536494 - I just called her.<br />- Call her again.
1537620 1539205 Give me a cigarette.
1544044 1546087 (phone ringing)
1549466 1551342 (Ginger on machine) Hi, there.
1551509 1554179 (laughs) Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.
1554345 1558975 But don't be shy. It's OK.<br />Machines need love, too, so talk to it...
1559142 1562520 - (turns up volume of music)<br />- (pop music plays)
1564355 1565815 Same shit.
1567150 1571237 I can hear it now. He's gonna be<br />called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
1571404 1576659 I hate these press cases.<br />Especially the weird press cases.
1578161 1580622 - Where are you going?<br />- To make a statement.
1580789 1582957 Maybe make these jackals work for us<br />for a change.
1583124 1587670 If I can get on the tube by 11:00,<br />maybe she'll call us.
1587837 1590423 Well, how do I look?
1590590 1593885 - Like shit, boss.<br />- Your mama.
1595011 1598181 This just in. Police have announced<br />the name of the victim
1598348 1602393 in the second of two execution style<br />murders which took place today.
1602560 1606356 Incredibly, the names<br />of the two victims are virtually identical.
1606523 1611069 Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann<br />Connor was pronounced dead...
1611820 1614030 - Can we change this?<br />- Sarah Louise Connor...
1614197 1615782 Don't touch it!
1617867 1622413 Police are refusing to speculate on<br />the similarity between the shooting deaths
1622580 1626668 and no other connection between<br />the two victims has been established yet.
1626835 1630213 We'll have more on<br />this late-breaking story as it comes in.

1702118 1704787 (loud music plays)
1721387 1723640 - Hey, you got a phone?<br />- It's in the back.
1723806 1726100 Hey, $4.50.
1738655 1741950 (rock music continues)
1765515 1766474 (woman) You have reached
1766641 1768559 the Los Angeles Police Department<br />emergency number.
1768726 1770270 All lines are busy.
1770436 1773523 If you need a police car sent out to you,<br />stay on the line.
1773856 1777485 (indistinct police radio chatter)
1800466 1802719 (pop music plays over headphones)
1835752 1836794 (screams, gasps)
1837795 1839172 Pugsley! Shoo!
1839339 1841966 Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.
1853436 1855021 Whoa!
1856773 1858608 Don't make me bust you up, man.

1918501 1919335 (phone rings)
1919502 1922964 (Ginger on machine) Hi, there.<br />Fooled you. You're talking to a machine.
1923131 1926008 But don't be shy. It's OK.<br />Machines need love, too.
1926175 1930138 So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,<br />or Sarah will get back to you.
1930304 1933099 - Wait for the beep.<br />- (beeping)
1933266 1935268 (Sarah) Ginger, this is Sarah.<br />Pick up if you're there.
1935435 1941274 I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard<br />called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.
1941441 1946362 I think that there's somebody after me.<br />I hope that you play this back soon.
1946529 1949657 I need you and Matt to come<br />and pick me up as soon as possible.
1950408 1953536 The police keep transferring me around.<br />I'm gonna give 'em another try.
1953703 1957957 The number here is 555-9175.
1958124 1960042 Call me, kiddo. I need your help.
1977185 1978478 (man) It's her.
1979812 1981981 Sarah Connor? it's Lieutenant Traxler.
1982148 1985401 Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and<br />don't transfer me to another department.
1985568 1988070 Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.<br />Can you tell me where you are?
1988237 1992074 - I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.<br />- Yeah, I know it. it's on Pico.
1992241 1994785 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.
1994952 1998831 - I think there's a guy following me.<br />- Now, listen carefully.
1998998 2001375 You're in a public place,<br />so you'll be safe till we get there.
2001542 2003836 But stay visible. Don't go outside<br />or even to the restroom.
2004003 2006923 - I'll have a car there in a minute.<br />- OK.
2007089 2010259 (loud music continues)
2031030 2032990 (woman) Hey, that guy didn't pay.
2034367 2036285 (groaning)

2271812 2274231 (tires screeching)
2278110 2280696 This is one-L-19.<br />I got a hit-and-run felony.
2280863 2285201 Suspect vehicle: late model<br />gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh.
2285367 2287703 He's really moving,<br />punching lights all the way.
2287870 2291665 I'm gonna need an ambulance<br />at Seventh and Broadway right now.
2293000 2294043 Hold it!
2296003 2297296 Ah!
2298714 2300591 (indistinct radio chatter)
2311185 2312102 Hold on.
2324073 2327743 Are you injured? Are you shot?
2329954 2331664 (shrieking)
2333290 2336669 Do exactly what I say. Exactly.
2336836 2340381 Don't move unless I say.<br />Don't make a sound unless I say.
2340548 2341966 Do you understand?
2342883 2346595 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes! Please don't hurt me.
2346762 2349265 (tires screeching)
2350766 2352685 (horn honks)
2364697 2366448 I'm here to help you.
2366615 2371203 I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.<br />DN38416. Assigned to protect you.
2371370 2373080 You've been targeted for termination.
2378627 2381964 (indistinct radio chatter)
2383257 2384967 (voice of officer) This is one-L-19.
2385134 2387636 Westbound on Olympic,<br />approaching Overland.
2392308 2395769 This is a mistake.<br />I didn't do anything.
2395936 2399648 No, but you will.<br />It's very important that you live.
2399815 2403193 This isn't true. How could that man<br />just get up after you...
2403360 2405738 it's not a man. A machine.
2405905 2409783 A Terminator.<br />Cyberdyne Systems model 101.
2409950 2413245 (tires screeching)
2418000 2421962 A machine? Like a robot?
2422129 2426634 Not a robot. A cyborg.<br />Cybernetic organism.
2426800 2429595 - No. He was bleeding.<br />- Just a second.
2429762 2431889 - (siren wailing)<br />- (tires screeching)
2433098 2434141 Get your head down!
2479103 2480187 All right, listen.
2480354 2484733 The Terminator's an infiltration unit.<br />Part man, part machine.
2484900 2488988 Underneath, it's a hyper-alloy<br />combat chassis. Microprocessor controlled.
2489154 2493784 Fully armored, very tough.<br />But outside it's living human tissue.
2493951 2498038 Flesh, skin, hair, blood...<br />grown for the cyborgs.
2498205 2500749 - Look, Reese, I don't know...<br />- Pay attention.
2500916 2502209 I gotta ditch this car.
2507840 2512011 The 600-Series had rubber skin.<br />We spotted them easy.
2512177 2514638 But these are new. They look human.
2514805 2518434 Sweat, bad breath, everything.<br />Very hard to spot.
2518600 2522312 I had to wait till he moved on you<br />before I could zero him.
2522479 2527943 Look, I am not stupid.<br />They cannot make things like that yet.
2528110 2532156 Not yet. Not for about 40 years.
2534783 2536702 Are you saying it's from the future?
2536869 2538954 One possible future.
2539955 2543250 From your point of view,<br />I don't know tech stuff.
2544418 2546628 Then you're from the future, too.<br />Is that right?
2546795 2548922 - Right.<br />- Right.
2557181 2562478 Cyborgs don't feel pain.<br />I do. Don't do that again.
2562644 2566482 - Just let me go.<br />- Listen and understand.
2566648 2570402 That Terminator is out there.
2570569 2574239 It can't be bargained with,<br />it can't be reasoned with.
2574907 2579119 It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear,
2579286 2585167 and it absolutely will not stop...<br />ever... until you are dead.
2595344 2597221 Can you stop it?
2600432 2602810 (sighs) I don't know.
2604686 2606939 With these weapons, I don't know.
2623455 2625124 (woman over police radio) All units.
2625290 2627751 Ford suspect vehicle has been found<br />in a parking structure...
2634133 2636927 (indistinct radio chatter)
2671378 2675674 Reese, why me?
2677759 2679303 Why does it want me?
2685976 2688103 There was a nuclear war.
2690272 2692900 A few years from now...
2694610 2699364 ...all this, this whole place,<br />everything...
2700240 2704870 ...it's gone. Just gone.
2705913 2707623 There were survivors.
2707789 2710792 Here, there.
2712586 2715047 Nobody even knew who started it.
2717716 2722471 - It was the machines, Sarah.<br />- I don't understand.
2722638 2725766 Defense network computers.
2725933 2729102 New, powerful...
2730604 2734524 ...hooked into everything,<br />trusted to run it all.
2735317 2739738 They say it got smart...<br />a new order of intelligence.
2741490 2744660 Then it saw all people as a threat.<br />Not just the ones on the other side.
2746662 2749456 It decided our fate in a microsecond.
2751124 2752876 Extermination.
2767266 2768642 Did you see this war?
2768809 2770644 (tires screeching)
2779444 2781029 (grunts)
2781196 2785993 No. I grew up after. In the ruins.
2786159 2789204 Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.
2789371 2792374 - H-Ks?<br />- Hunter-killers.
2792541 2796295 Patrol machines<br />built in automated factories.
2796461 2800716 Most of us were rounded up,<br />put in camps for orderly disposal.
2802759 2805053 This was burned in by laser scanner.
2809016 2813562 Some of us were kept alive. To work.
2814521 2815897 Loading bodies.
2817024 2819735 The disposal units ran night and day.
2819901 2822779 We were that close<br />to going out forever.
2825866 2829745 But there was one man<br />who taught us to fight.
2829911 2831830 To storm the wire of the camps.
2831997 2835292 To smash those metal<br />motherfuckers into junk.
2836918 2839671 He turned it around.<br />He brought us back from the brink.
2839838 2844092 His name was Connor. John Connor.
2844259 2848722 Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.
2861109 2863153 (engine turning over)
2878460 2880212 (tires screeching)
2930429 2931263 (gunshot)
2933098 2934599 (gunfire)
2958498 2959499 Drive!
2966798 2967883 Reese!
2968717 2969885 Reese!
2979895 2981730 (sirens wailing)
2987903 2991281 No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.
2991448 2994284 (officer) You in the Cadillac,<br />let me see your hands now.
2997454 2998455 Get out of the car.
3002209 3004419 Drop to your knees.
3004586 3007214 - Out of the car.<br />- Drop to the ground.
3036535 3040455 Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.
3043458 3045627 Listen, are you sure it's them?
3045794 3048588 (sobbing) I mean,<br />maybe I should look at the bodies.
3048755 3051633 No. They've been identified<br />and there's no doubt.
3055470 3057347 (sobbing) Ginger.
3058932 3062394 - Kiddo.<br />- Sarah...
3062561 3065730 - Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.<br />- Hi, Sarah.
3065897 3069943 I want you to tell him everything<br />Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?
3070110 3072195 Yeah, I guess so.
3073989 3077826 - You're a doctor?<br />- (yawning) Criminal psychologist.
3077993 3082205 - Is Reese crazy?<br />- That's what we're gonna find out.
3159240 3161826 (gears whirring)
3167415 3170919 (Silberman) So you're a soldier.<br />Fighting for whom?
3172420 3177467 With the 132nd under Perry.<br />From '21 to '27.
3178259 3180720 That's the year 2027?
3180887 3182972 (Reese) That's right.<br />Then I was assigned...
3183139 3186768 - This is fucking great.<br />- ...under John Connor.
3186935 3190021 - Who was the enemy?<br />- A computer defense system built...
3190188 3192732 - (pager beeping)<br />- God damn. Sorry.
3192899 3196236 ...built for SAC-NORAD<br />by Cyberdyne Systems.
3196403 3198363 I see.
3198530 3204411 And this computer thinks it can win<br />by killing the mother of its enemy.
3204577 3207789 Killing him, in effect,<br />before he's even conceived.
3207956 3209958 A sort of retroactive abortion?
3210125 3211668 (chuckles)
3211835 3215088 Silberman cracks me up.<br />Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
3215255 3217757 - He screwed it first...<br />- Ed, shut up.
3217924 3220260 Why didn't the computer<br />just kill Connor then?
3220427 3222971 Why this elaborate scheme<br />with the Terminator?
3223138 3227225 It had no choice.<br />Their defense grid was smashed.
3227392 3231813 We'd won. Taking out Connor then<br />would make no difference.
3231980 3234774 Skynet had to wipe out<br />his entire existence.
3234941 3238153 Is that when you captured<br />the lab complex and found...
3238319 3239988 What is it called?
3240155 3242323 The time displacement equipment?
3242490 3246536 That's right. The Terminator<br />had already gone through.
3246703 3249581 Connor sent me to intercept,<br />and they blew the whole place.
3249748 3251583 Well, how are you supposed to get back?
3252459 3254169 I can't.
3255670 3261259 Nobody goes home.<br />Nobody else comes through.
3262010 3265096 It's just him and me.
3326199 3330411 (gears whirring)
3369534 3372370 It's just him and me.
3375456 3378001 (Silberman) Why didn't you<br />bring any weapons?
3378167 3380420 Something more advanced.
3380587 3383548 Don't you have ray guns?
3383715 3387385 - (chuckles) Ray guns.<br />- Show me a piece of future technology.
3387552 3389429 (Reese) You go naked.
3389596 3391931 Something about the field generated<br />by a living organism.
3392098 3394142 - Nothing dead will go.<br />- Why?
3394309 3395977 I didn't build the fucking thing.
3396144 3400899 (Silberman) OK, OK. But this cyborg,<br />if it's metal...?
3401065 3403484 - Surrounded by living tissue.<br />- Oh, right.
3404277 3407030 This is great stuff.<br />I could make a career out of this guy.
3407196 3409991 See how clever it is?<br />It doesn't require a shred of proof.
3410158 3413620 Most paranoid delusions are intricate,<br />but this is brilliant.
3415955 3418124 (Silberman) Why were<br />the other two women killed?
3418291 3419918 (Reese) Most records<br />were lost in the war.
3420084 3422670 Skynet knew almost nothing<br />about Connor's mother.
3422837 3426257 Her full name, where she lived.<br />They just knew the city.
3426424 3429510 The Terminator was<br />just being systematic.
3429677 3432513 - (Silberman) Let's go back...<br />- Look, you have heard enough.
3432680 3435642 I have answered your questions.<br />Now I have to see Sarah Connor.
3435808 3439771 - I'm afraid that's not up to me.<br />- Then why am I talking to you?
3439938 3441773 - Who is in authority here?<br />- Please...
3441940 3443483 Shut up!
3444233 3446861 You still don't get it, do you?
3447028 3452116 He'll find her. That's what he does.<br />That's all he does.
3452283 3454035 You can't stop him.
3454202 3457830 He'll reach down her throat<br />and pull her fucking heart out!
3457997 3460500 - Doc.<br />- Let go of me!
3464420 3465421 Sorry.
3469842 3472220 (sighs) So Reese is crazy?
3472387 3475890 In technical terminology, he's a loon.
3476724 3482188 Sarah, this is what they call<br />body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.
3482355 3484482 It'll stop a 12-gauge round.
3484649 3486859 This other individual must've<br />been wearing one under his coat.
3487026 3488695 Feel that. Go ahead.
3490989 3494575 - He punched through the windshield.<br />- He was probably on PCP.
3494742 3497412 Broke every bone in his hand.<br />He wouldn't feel it for hours.
3497578 3499163 There was this guy once...<br />You see this scar?
3499330 3500748 - Here.<br />- Thank you.
3502166 3505920 There's a couch in this other room.<br />Stretch out and get some sleep.
3506087 3508423 Be at least an hour before your mother<br />gets here from Big Bear.
3508589 3511676 - I can't sleep.<br />- Try.
3511843 3516097 It may not look it,<br />but that couch is very comfortable.
3517390 3521894 You'll be perfectly safe.<br />We got 30 cops in this building.
3522770 3524022 Thank you.
3530486 3531988 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
3532155 3533740 (buzzer sounds)
3539245 3540955 (pager beeping)
3547170 3550798 I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.<br />I was told she's here. Could I see her?
3550965 3553134 No. Can't see her.<br />She's making a statement.
3553301 3554427 Where is she?
3555386 3558181 It may take a while. if you wanna wait,<br />there's a bench over there.
3569734 3571235 I'll be back.
3608689 3611275 - Ah!<br />- (indistinct shouting)
3620827 3622161 Let's go, let's go!
3622328 3623663 (gunfire)
3626916 3628042 Stay here.
3628209 3630253 (gunfire)
3642515 3644392 Let's get outta here!
3644559 3646769 (indistinct shouting)
3652191 3653860 (gunfire)
3668499 3669625 Watch him.
3671752 3673754 (grunting)
3690271 3692273 (gunfire continues)
3720635 3723471 (indistinct shouting)
3737485 3738819 Ed...
3739695 3741030 Hey!
3767682 3768516 Sarah!
3770518 3771852 Reese.
3775773 3776941 (Reese) This way.
3794125 3796919 (tires screeching)
3817732 3820318 (man on radio) KFLB news time 4:36.
3820484 3824280 Top story of the hour: the largest<br />single law enforcement mobilization
3824447 3827033 in California history<br />is currently underway.
3827199 3830786 Police in five counties are engaged<br />in a massive manhunt for...
3834373 3835750 Take this.
3838836 3840546 All right,<br />let's get this off the road.
3872536 3875414 - You cold?<br />- Freezing.
3882838 3884632 (shuddering)
3889387 3890554 Reese?
3892473 3896185 - You got a first name?<br />- Kyle.
3896352 3900648 Kyle, what's it like<br />when you go through time?
3903484 3905319 White light.
3907780 3909115 Pain.
3912410 3916664 - It's like being born maybe.<br />- Oh, my God.
3917581 3919500 I caught one back there.
3921085 3923838 - You mean you got shot?<br />- It's not bad.
3924713 3928175 - We gotta get you to a doctor.<br />- It's OK. Forget it.
3928342 3933013 What do you mean, forget it?<br />Are you crazy? Take this off.
3945276 3947278 Jesus.
3947445 3950322 See? it passed right through the meat.
3950489 3952116 (groans) This is gonna make me puke.
3952867 3955661 - Would you just talk about something?<br />- What?
3955828 3959290 I don't know. Anything.<br />Just talk. Tell me about my son.
3961125 3962710 He's about my height.
3966380 3968382 He has your eyes.
3971719 3973304 What's he like?
3974096 3977766 You trust him.<br />He's got a strength.
3979477 3981353 I'd die for John Connor.
3984273 3987902 Well, at least now I know<br />what to name him.
3989069 3993824 Don't suppose you know who the father is<br />so I won't tell him to get lost?
3993991 3996744 John never said much about him.
3996911 3999413 - I know he dies before the war...<br />- Wait.
4001332 4003125 I don't wanna know.
4004418 4007129 So was it John that sent you here?
4007838 4009381 I volunteered.
4010633 4014428 - Why?<br />- It was a chance to meet the legend.
4015513 4022353 Sarah Connor,<br />who taught her son to fight, organize,
4022520 4024605 prepare from when he was a kid.
4024772 4026815 When you were in hiding before the war.
4029944 4034365 (laughs) You're talking about things<br />I haven't done yet in the past tense.
4034532 4036408 - It's driving me crazy.<br />- (groans)
4040287 4043040 Are you sure you have the right person?
4043207 4045251 I'm sure.
4045417 4049129 Come on. Do I look like<br />the mother of the future?
4050965 4055803 I mean, am I tough? Organized?<br />I can't even balance my checkbook.
4058597 4062726 Look, Reese, I didn't ask<br />for this honor and I don't want it.
4062893 4064353 Any of it.
4067648 4071860 Your son gave me a message<br />to give to you. Made me memorize it.
4073195 4075906 "'Thank you, Sarah,<br />for your courage through the dark years.
4076073 4078200 I can't help you<br />with what you must soon face,
4078367 4080661 except to say the future is not set.
4080828 4083330 You must be stronger<br />than you imagine you can be.
4083497 4086000 You must survive or I will never exist."'
4087334 4088794 That's all.
4091755 4093299 It's a good field dressing.
4094842 4096343 You like it?
4097094 4098512 It's my first.
4102808 4105185 (Reese) Get some sleep.<br />It'll be light soon.
4109440 4110691 OK.
4121368 4123287 Talk to me some more.
4126540 4128083 About what?
4129293 4131420 Tell me about<br />where you're from.
4133881 4135382 All right.
4137301 4141805 You stay down by day,<br />but at night you can move around.
4141972 4145893 You still have to be careful<br />because the H-Ks use infrared.
4148020 4153067 But they're not too bright.<br />John taught us ways to dust them.
4154526 4156779 That's when the infiltrators<br />started to appear.
4156945 4159281 The Terminators were the newest.
4159615 4160532 The worst.
4170584 4172419 (man over radio) Traversing<br />your sector in search mode.
4172586 4175172 750 meters north of your position.
4180135 4181261 Let's go.
4226724 4230686 - (Reese) Reese. DN384...<br />- Right. Let him in.
4239319 4241989 (indistinct radio chatter)
4253333 4255627 (imitating gunfire)
4258172 4261633 (woman coughing)
4278025 4280527 (woman sobbing)
4315103 4317397 (dog barking)
4322194 4324071 (man) Terminator!
4328992 4330077 (screaming)
4336250 4337751 (woman shrieks)
4342965 4343799 Ah!
4345300 4347928 - (dog whimpering)<br />- (screaming)
4394308 4397477 (dog barking in distance)
4401315 4403650 I was dreaming about dogs.
4404902 4407279 We use 'em to spot Terminators.
4408363 4410908 Your world is pretty terrifying.
4449696 4453533 Hey, buddy,<br />you got a dead cat in there or what?
4453700 4456119 (knocking)
4456286 4459289 (mechanical whirring)
4460958 4463126 Fuck you, asshole.
4470801 4473011 (mechanical whirring)
4481979 4483814 God damn.
4484898 4486316 (Sarah) Thank you.
4486483 4487985 (horn blares)
4491738 4493240 Is this enough?
4493907 4497077 Yeah, it's enough.<br />I don't wanna ask where you got it.
4503417 4504918 - (man) I'm coming.<br />- We need a room.
4505085 4507087 - (man) All right.<br />- With a kitchen.
4507254 4508714 Do you have one with a kitchen?
4524771 4527607 I am dying for a shower.
4529234 4531403 We should check your bandage, too.
4531987 4534656 Later. I'm going out for supplies.
4539369 4540537 Keep this.
4566605 4569983 No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.<br />I was told not to say.
4570150 4572319 (mother) But I need<br />to know where to reach you.
4572486 4577616 You tell me to hide out at the cabin<br />and you won't tell me what's going on?
4577783 4580535 I am worried sick here.
4580702 4584456 OK. OK, here's the number.
4584623 4586833 - (Sarah) You ready?<br />- Yes. Go ahead.
4587000 4593673 It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.
4593840 4595592 - Got it?<br />- I've got it.
4595759 4599930 I gotta go. I'm sorry<br />I can't tell you more right now.
4600097 4601848 I love you, Mom.
4605352 4607229 (mother's voice)<br />I love you, too, sweetheart.
4620117 4621076 (man) Tiki Motel.
4621243 4622536 (normal voice)<br />Give me your address there.
4626206 4627874 (Sarah) What have we got?
4631002 4637134 Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.
4637300 4638927 What's for dinner?
4639636 4642722 - Plastique.<br />- Mm. That sounds good.
4642889 4644266 What is it?
4645183 4648728 It's a nitroglycerin base.<br />It's a bit more stable.
4648895 4650772 I learned to make it when I was a kid.
4662659 4664786 Make sure there's none on the threads.
4666997 4668415 Like this.
4670375 4672169 Screw the end cap on.
4674087 4675630 Very gently.
4678383 4680677 You must've had a fun childhood.
4684389 4685765 That's good.
4686725 4689769 All right. Six more like that<br />and I'll get started on the fuses.
4701239 4703200 (Sarah) He'll find us, won't he?
4706203 4707704 (Reese) Probably.
4725805 4727933 It'll never be over, will it?
4736358 4738360 Look at me. I'm shaking.
4739569 4744658 Some legend.<br />You must be pretty disappointed.
4745742 4749663 No, I'm not.
4758380 4763677 Kyle, the women in your time,
4763843 4765929 what are they like?
4768014 4770100 Good fighters.
4770267 4772310 That's not what I meant.
4774479 4776314 Was there someone special?
4778358 4779901 Someone?
4780527 4782696 A girl, you know.
4784197 4785573 No.
4788368 4789995 Never.
4791579 4793206 Never?
4798169 4801548 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
4804426 4806511 So much pain.
4807887 4812225 Pain can be controlled.<br />You just disconnect it.
4812392 4814644 So you feel nothing?
4819816 4822736 John Connor gave me<br />a picture of you once.
4824654 4826448 I didn't know why at the time.
4827907 4833747 It was very old... torn, faded.
4837584 4843590 You were young like you are now.<br />You seemed just a little sad.
4845133 4847886 I used to always wonder<br />what you were thinking at that moment.
4849346 4851556 I memorized every line...
4853058 4854934 ...every curve.
4858605 4860523 I came across time for you, Sarah.
4862442 4866738 I love you. I always have.
4884798 4886466 I shouldn't have said that.
4977348 4978391 Think fast.
4978558 4980351 (both chuckle)
4980518 4981895 (dog barking)
5001915 5003750 (gun clicks)
5068606 5069941 Trade places.
5080952 5084289 (Reese) Faster! Drive faster!
5101514 5102682 (horn blares)
5123369 5124454 - (gunfire)<br />- (gasping)
5130960 5131919 (screams)
5134213 5137383 Kyle! Oh, my God.
5158404 5159697 (Sarah screams)
5160490 5161908 (screams)
5168790 5171459 (Reese groaning)
5171626 5172960 Kyle.
5184347 5186057 (truck horn blaring)
5187684 5189102 - Whoa!<br />- Son-of-a-bitch!
5190770 5192814 (tires squealing)
5205284 5206285 You stay here.
5230268 5231436 Let's get outta here.
5235106 5236357 Get out.
5253499 5256461 Kyle. Come on. Get up.
5265011 5267555 Kyle, come on.
5268681 5271559 Help me! Get out. Get out.
5277523 5279609 (tires squealing)
5296042 5298002 Don't stop. Run!
5430176 5431719 (Reese) Sarah!
5432762 5433638 Kyle.
5439685 5442229 Kyle. Kyle...
5444315 5447068 We did it, Kyle. We got him.
5466796 5467880 (Sarah) No!
5468381 5469715 No!
5506919 5510006 (panting)
5525604 5526897 Wait.
5531736 5533362 What are you doing?
5534238 5537408 Cover, so he can't track us.
5539869 5543039 (machinery whirring)
5547126 5550296 Come on! Come on.
5550463 5554133 - No, Kyle! Come on!<br />- (grunting)
5554884 5556635 - Come on!<br />- Leave me here.
5567772 5572151 Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!
5572485 5574653 On your feet!
5575196 5576030 Move it!
5626497 5629458 (loud mechanical whirring)
5648144 5649812 (Sarah) Get back. Go back.
5684346 5686140 - Run, Sarah.<br />- No.
5686307 5687600 Run!
5691437 5692396 Run!
5693606 5695149 (Reese) Come on, motherfucker.
5737608 5739276 (grunts)
5744990 5746784 (shrieks)
5764843 5768097 (yelping)
5808137 5810306 No.
5816312 5818856 (screams)
5928799 5930467 You're terminated, fucker.
5931343 5932886 (mechanical whirring)
5937057 5940394 (fizzling)
5964543 5967463 (shuddering)
5973218 5975846 (sirens approaching)
5988650 5989902 Kyle.
5992362 5994865 (indistinct radio chatter)
6010923 6014927 (Sarah) Tape seven.<br />November 10. Where was I?
6015886 6019723 What's most difficult is trying to decide<br />what to tell you and what not to.
6020432 6024436 But I guess I have a while before you're<br />old enough to understand these tapes.
6024603 6028357 They're more for me at this point<br />just so that I can get it straight.
6059555 6063016 (both speaking Spanish)
6065477 6066812 Fill her up. (speaks Spanish)
6070482 6073610 (Sarah) Should I tell you<br />about your father?
6073777 6076029 Boy, that's a tough one.
6077573 6082077 Will it affect your decision to send him<br />here, knowing that he is your father?
6084329 6087082 If you don't send Kyle,<br />you can never be.
6087249 6090335 God, a person could go crazy<br />thinking about this.
6094006 6095882 I suppose I will tell you.
6097718 6099511 I owe him that.
6101930 6104266 Maybe it'll help if...
6104433 6109855 ...you know that in the few hours<br />that we had together...
6111523 6113942 ...we loved a lifetime's worth.
6117779 6121533 (speaking Spanish)
6126830 6130667 - What did he just say?<br />- He says you're very beautiful.
6130834 6133712 He is ashamed to ask you<br />for five American dollars for this picture.
6133879 6137299 But if he doesn't,<br />his father will beat him.
6137466 6140218 Pretty good hustle, kid.
6140385 6142971 (speaking Spanish)
6147184 6149895 (boy speaking Spanish)
6151521 6153649 (speaking Spanish)
6156526 6158111 What did he just say?
6158862 6160947 He said there's a storm coming in.
6165369 6167245 I know.
6167412 6170957 (wind howling)
6181009 6183220 (thunder crashes)
