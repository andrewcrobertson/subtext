88150 91450 THE MACHINES ROSE FROM THE<br />ASHES OF THE NUCLEAR FIRE.
91570 95280 THEIR WAR TO EXTERMINATE MANKIND<br />HAS RAGED FOR DECADES,
95410 98910 BUT THE FINAL BATTLE WOULD NOT<br />BE FOUGHT IN THE FUTURE.

814550 818260 Look at it this way.<br />In 100 years, who's gonna care?
825600 828060 The 1 2-gauge auto-loader.
829980 834110 That's ltalian. You can go pump or auto.
834820 837690 The 45 long slide with laser sighting.
837820 841280 These are new. We just got them in.<br />That's a good gun.
841990 845660 The beam comes on - you put the red dot<br />where you want the bullet to go.
845780 847830 You can't miss.
849200 853380 - Anything else?<br />- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.
853500 856210 Hey, just what you see, pal.
856300 858920 The Uzi nine millimetre.
859050 861510 You know your weapons, buddy.
861630 864930 Any one of these is ideal<br />for home defence.
865050 867970 So which will it be?
868100 871690 - All.<br />- I may close early today.
871810 876110 It's a 1 5-day wait on the handguns,<br />but the rifles you can take now.
877190 879280 - You can't do that.<br />- Wrong.
906180 908970 Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.
909100 913310 Listen, I need you to come pick me up.<br />My bike just broke down.
913440 916730 I don't care what you're doing.<br />Come and get me. What the...?
917360 921690 Hey, man, you got<br />a serious attitude problem.
974750 977120 - Sarah Connor?<br />- Yes?
989800 992350 I'm on my break, Chuck.<br />Carla's got my station.
992470 996190 Sarah, come here. It's about you.<br />I mean, sort of.
998310 1002860 Incredible. You're not gonna believe this.<br />You're going to love this.
1003730 1006860 - What?<br />- ..compiled from several witnesses.
1006990 1010280 Once again, Sarah Connor,<br />35, mother oftwo,
1010410 1012830 brutally shot to death this afternoon.
1012950 1015200 You're dead, honey.
1208060 1210190 ..if you're into sound,
1210320 1214650 for the greatest sound around,<br />come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.
1214780 1218910 We've got woofers, tweeters,<br />the newest in audio and compact discs.
1219030 1222410 We've got graphic equalisers<br />and sound balancers that...
1245770 1247560 Sorry.
1259570 1261200 Hello?
1261330 1265540 First I'm gonna rip the buttons<br />off your blouse one by one,
1265660 1270000 then run my tongue down your neck<br />to your bare, gleaming breasts.
1270130 1275510 And then slowly... slowly pull<br />yourjeans offinch by inch.
1277220 1278840 Ginger, it's Matt.
1278970 1283100 And lick your belly in circles<br />further and further down,
1283220 1286480 and then pull your panties off<br />with my teeth.
1286600 1289100 Who is this?
1289230 1291400 God. Sarah?
1292940 1295530 Jesus. I'm sorry.
1295650 1298280 I thought you were...<br />Can I talk to Ginger?
1298400 1299860 Sure.
1302490 1304540 It's the creep.
1305870 1306870 Hello?
1307000 1310500 First I'll rip the buttons off<br />your blouse one by one...
1312250 1317420 You fucking pigs. Wait till I get<br />my hands on you. Get off me.
1319340 1321390 Ed.
1322800 1324850 - What have you got?<br />- Dead girl.
1324970 1328600 - I can see that.<br />- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.
1328730 1332440 Shot six times at less than 10 feet.<br />Large calibre weapon.
1332560 1334610 You know, these work.
1335940 1338570 - What's this?<br />- Dead girl two.
1338690 1341990 Sent over from the Valley division<br />this afternoon.
1343070 1345950 Are you sure there's a point to all of this?
1346080 1348450 Look at the name, Ed.
1348580 1352290 Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?
1354080 1355290 You're kidding.
1355420 1358050 The press is gonna be short-stroking it.
1358170 1362550 - A one-day pattern killer.<br />- I hate the weird ones.
1366930 1368970 So...
1370310 1372850 Better than mortal man deserves.
1379990 1384320 - Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?<br />- Not lately. Did you check messages?
1384450 1386830 I thought you did.
1391080 1395080 - Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...<br />- There you are, young man.
1395210 1397460 You mind your mother.
1401260 1404720 Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.<br />Something's come up.
1404840 1408600 Looks like I won't be able to make it<br />tonight. Just can't get out ofit.
1408720 1413440 I'm really sorry. I'll make it up to you.<br />Call you in a day or so. Bye.
1415190 1418270 That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?
1418400 1423070 He can't treat you like this.<br />It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.
1423200 1425240 I'll live.
1425360 1427620 I'll break his kneecaps.
1428240 1432120 Well, Pugsley still loves me.<br />Don't you, baby?
1433580 1435790 God. It's disgusting.
1438000 1440710 I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.<br />Have a good time.
1440800 1443720 - We will. You, too.<br />- OK.
1448010 1450060 Damn it, Matt.
1506700 1508740 Shit.
1508860 1512990 These killings occurred in the order<br />of their listings in the phone book.
1513120 1516460 - What can I tell you? No comment.<br />- But, Lieutenant...
1528630 1531090 That coffee's two hours cold.
1532050 1534600 I put a cigarette out in it.
1534720 1538230 - Did you reach the next girl yet?<br />- No. I got her answering machine.
1538350 1540900 - Send a unit.<br />- I sent a unit. There's no answer.
1541020 1543360 - The apartment manager's not in.<br />- Call her.
1543480 1546360 - I just called her.<br />- Call her again.
1546490 1548530 Give me a cigarette.
1558500 1563460 Hi, there. Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.
1563590 1567670 But don't be shy. It's OK.<br />Machines need love, too, so talk to it...
1573470 1575510 Same shit.
1576430 1580270 I can hear it now. He's gonna be<br />called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
1580390 1585610 I hate these press cases.<br />Especially the weird press cases.
1587110 1589820 - Where are you going?<br />- To make a statement.
1589900 1591950 Maybe make these jackals work for us.
1592070 1596870 If I can get on the tube by eleven o'clock,<br />maybe she'll call us.
1596990 1599620 Well, how do I look?
1599750 1603080 - Like shit, boss.<br />- Your mama.
1604250 1607380 This just in. Police have announced<br />the name ofthe victim
1607500 1611010 in the second oftwo murders<br />which took place today.
1611130 1615550 Incredibly, the names ofthe<br />two victims are virtually identical.
1615680 1620850 Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann<br />Connor was pronounced dead...
1620980 1623230 - Can we change this?<br />- Sarah Louise...
1623350 1625860 Don't touch it.
1626980 1631450 Police are refusing to speculate on the<br />similarity between the shooting deaths
1631570 1635870 and no other connection between<br />the two victims has been established yet.
1635990 1639790 We'll have more on this<br />late-breaking story as it comes in.
1730500 1732750 - Hey, you got a phone?<br />- It's in the back.
1732880 1735340 Hey. Four-fifty.
1774510 1777800 You have reached the Los Angeles<br />Police emergency number.
1777930 1782680 All lines are busy. Ifyou need a police car<br />sent out to you, stay on the line.
1848290 1851040 Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.
1865890 1868970 Don't make me bust you up, man.
1928200 1932040 Hi, there. Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.
1932160 1935120 But don't be shy. It's OK.<br />Machines need love, too.
1935250 1939340 So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,<br />or Sarah will get back to you.
1939460 1942010 Wait for the beep.
1942130 1944470 This is Sarah. Pick up ifyou're there.
1944590 1950390 I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard<br />called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.
1950510 1955560 I think that there's somebody after me.<br />I hope that you play this back soon.
1955690 1959270 I need you and Matt to come<br />and pick me up as soon as possible.
1959400 1962780 The police keep transferring me.<br />I'm gonna give 'em another try.
1962900 1969200 The number here is 555 9175.<br />Call me, kiddo. I need your help.
1986510 1987510 It's her.
1988890 1991140 Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.
1991260 1994600 Don't put me on hold.<br />Don't transfer me to another department.
1994730 1996980 I won't. Can you tell me where you are?
1997100 2001060 - I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.<br />- I know it. It's on Pico.
2001190 2003900 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.
2003980 2008110 - I think there's a guy following me.<br />- Now, listen carefully.
2008240 2013040 You're in a public place so you'll be safe.<br />Stay visible. Don't go outside.
2013160 2016250 - I'll have a car there in a minute.<br />- OK.
2040190 2042230 Hey, that guy didn't pay.
2202060 2205350 Come with me if you wanna live.
2213440 2215490 Come on!
2287180 2289900 This is one-L-19. I got a hit-and-run felony.
2290020 2294360 Suspect vehicle - Iate model<br />grey Ford headed westbound on Seven.
2294480 2296650 He's really moving - punching lights.
2296780 2301530 I'm gonna need an ambulance<br />at Seventh and Broadway right now.
2301660 2303910 Hold it.
2320220 2322510 Hold on.
2333190 2337230 Are you injured? Are you shot?
2342360 2345870 Do exactly what I say. Exactly.
2345990 2349500 Don't move unless I say.<br />Don't make a sound unless I say.
2349620 2351920 Do you understand?
2352040 2356590 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes. Please don't hurt me.
2373770 2375610 I'm here to help you.
2375730 2380400 I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.<br />DN38416. Assigned to protect you.
2380530 2382860 You've been targeted for termination.
2392290 2397250 This is one-L-19. Westbound<br />on Olympic. Approaching Overland.
2401340 2404840 This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.
2404970 2408680 No, but you will.<br />It's very important that you live.
2408810 2412310 This isn't true. How could that man<br />just get up after you...
2412430 2415350 It's not a man. A machine.
2415480 2418980 A Terminator.<br />Cyberdyne Systems model 101 .
2427120 2431160 A machine? Like a robot?
2431290 2435830 Not a robot. A cyborg -<br />cybernetic organism.
2435960 2438790 - No. He was bleeding.<br />- Just a second.
2442260 2444630 Get your head down.
2488260 2493140 Listen. The Terminator's an infiltration<br />unit. Part man, part machine.
2493850 2498190 Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat<br />chassis. Microprocessor controlled.
2498310 2502780 Fully armoured, very tough.<br />Outside it's living human tissue.
2502900 2507240 Flesh, skin, hair, blood -<br />grown for the cyborgs.
2507360 2510200 - Look, Reese, I don't know...<br />- Pay attention.
2510320 2512790 I gotta ditch this car.
2516960 2521080 The 600-Series had rubber skin.<br />We spotted them easy.
2521210 2523710 But these are new. They look human.
2523840 2527670 Sweat, bad breath, everything.<br />Very hard to spot.
2527800 2531390 I had to wait till he moved on you<br />before I could zero him.
2531510 2537180 Look, I am not stupid.<br />They cannot make things like that yet.
2537310 2541230 Not yet. Not for about forty years.
2543650 2545900 Are you saying it's from the future?
2546030 2549740 One possible future...<br />from your point of view.
2549860 2552990 I don't know tech stuff.
2553120 2555870 Then you're from the future, too.<br />Is that right?
2555990 2558040 - Right.<br />- Right.
2566210 2571590 Cyborgs don't feel pain.<br />I do. Don't do that again.
2571720 2575720 - Just let me go.<br />- Listen and understand.
2575850 2578310 That Terminator is out there.
2579560 2583360 It can't be bargained with,<br />it can't be reasoned with.
2583980 2588190 It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear
2588320 2594280 and it absolutely will not stop,<br />ever, until you are dead.
2604380 2607250 Can you stop it?
2610510 2612550 I don't know.
2613550 2616010 With these weapons, I don't know.
2632490 2636950 All units. Ford suspect vehicle has<br />been found in a parking structure...
2680370 2684920 Reese, why me?
2687000 2689710 Why does it want me?
2695130 2697680 There was a nuclear war.
2699260 2701520 A few years from now,
2703640 2709270 all this, this whole place, everything,
2709400 2713990 it's gone, just gone.
2714780 2716820 There were survivors.
2716950 2718990 Here, there.
2721660 2724750 Nobody even knew who started it.
2726920 2731710 - It was the machines, Sarah.<br />- I don't understand.
2731840 2734380 Defence network computers.
2735130 2738220 New, powerful,
2739390 2744140 hooked into everything,<br />trusted to run it all.
2744270 2748810 They say it got smart -<br />a new order of intelligence.
2750480 2755650 Then it saw all people as a threat.<br />Not just the ones on the other side.
2755780 2758660 It decided our fate in a microsecond.
2760160 2762200 Extermination.
2776380 2778630 Did you see this war?
2790350 2795190 No. I grew up after. In the ruins.
2795320 2798400 Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.
2798530 2801410 - H-Ks?<br />- Hunter-killers.
2801530 2805450 Patrol machines<br />built in automated factories.
2805580 2810210 Most of us were rounded up.<br />Put in camps for orderly disposal.
2811580 2814210 This was burned in by laser scanner.
2818090 2822220 Some of us were kept alive. To work.
2823430 2825970 Loading bodies.
2826100 2828810 The disposal units ran night and day.
2828890 2831980 We were that close to going out for ever.
2835230 2838740 But there was one man<br />who taught us to fight.
2838860 2840900 To storm the wire of the camps.
2841030 2844620 To smash those metal<br />motherfuckers into junk.
2845870 2848870 He turned it around.<br />He brought us back from the brink.
2849000 2853330 His name was Connor. John Connor.
2853460 2858090 Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.
2967910 2969620 Drive.
2975910 2978630 Reese!
2996810 3000270 No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.
3000400 3004190 You in the Cadillac,<br />let me see your hands now.
3006650 3009110 Get out of the car.
3011580 3013620 Drop to your knees.
3013740 3017040 - Out of the car.<br />- Drop to the ground.
3045400 3049740 Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.
3052490 3054540 Listen, are you sure it's them?
3054660 3057660 I mean,<br />maybe I should look at the bodies.
3057790 3062000 No. They've been identified<br />and there's no doubt.
3064590 3069170 Ginger. Kiddo.
3069680 3074930 - Sarah, this is Dr Silberman.<br />- Hi, Sarah.
3075060 3079100 Tell him everything Reese told you,<br />Sarah. Do you feel up to that?
3079230 3081270 Yeah, I guess so.
3083110 3087070 - You're a doctor?<br />- Criminal psychologist.
3087190 3091990 - Is Reese crazy?<br />- That's what we're gonna find out.
3176490 3180200 So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
3181370 3186920 With the 1 32nd under Perry.<br />From '21 to '27.
3187040 3189840 That's the year 2027?
3189960 3192010 That's right. Then I was assigned...
3192130 3195930 - This is fucking great.<br />- ..under John Connor.
3196050 3199140 - Who was the enemy?<br />- A computer defence system...
3199260 3201560 Goddamn! Sorry.
3201680 3205190 ..built for SAC-NORAD<br />by Cyberdyne Systems.
3205310 3207350 I see.
3207480 3213280 And this computer thinks it can win<br />by killing the mother of its enemy.
3213400 3216700 Killing him, in effect,<br />before he's even conceived.
3216820 3219070 A sort of retroactive abortion?
3220580 3224080 Silberman cracks me up.<br />Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
3224200 3226290 - He screwed it first...<br />- Ed, shut up.
3226420 3229130 Why didn't the computer<br />just kill Connor then?
3229210 3231750 Why this elaborate scheme<br />with the Terminator?
3231880 3236340 It had no choice.<br />Their defence grid was smashed.
3236470 3240850 We'd won. Taking out Connor then<br />would make no difference.
3240970 3243890 Skynet had to wipe out<br />his entire existence.
3244020 3248810 Is that when you captured the lab<br />complex and found... What is it called?
3248940 3251400 The time displacement equipment?
3251520 3255360 That's right. The Terminator<br />had already gone through.
3255490 3258530 Connor sent me to intercept<br />and they blew the whole place.
3258660 3261370 Well, how are you supposed to get back?
3261450 3263490 I can't.
3264580 3269750 Nobody goes home.<br />Nobody else comes through.
3270920 3274420 It's just him and me.
3378820 3381360 It's just him and me.
3384410 3389540 Why didn't you bring any weapons?<br />Something more advanced.
3389660 3392540 Don't you have ray guns?
3392660 3396210 - Ray guns.<br />- Show me a piece of future technology.
3396340 3401010 You go naked. Something about the<br />field generated by a living organism.
3401130 3404840 Nothing dead will go.<br />I didn't build the fucking thing.
3404970 3409470 OK, OK. But this cyborg, ifit's metal... ?
3409600 3413100 - Surrounded by living tissue.<br />- Oh, right.
3413230 3416060 Great stuff.<br />I could make a career out of this guy.
3416190 3419150 See how clever it is?<br />It doesn't require a shred of proof.
3419270 3423900 Most paranoid delusions are intricate,<br />but this is brilliant.
3424910 3428740 - Why were the other women killed?<br />- Records were lost in the war.
3428870 3431580 Skynet knew almost nothing<br />about Connor's mother.
3431660 3435370 Her full name, where she lived.<br />Theyjust knew the city.
3435500 3438380 The Terminator was<br />just being systematic.
3438500 3441300 - Let's go back...<br />- Look, you have heard enough.
3441420 3444760 I have answered your questions.<br />I have to see Sarah Connor.
3444880 3448720 - I'm afraid that's not up to me.<br />- Then why am I talking to you?
3448850 3450890 - Who is in authority here?<br />- Please...
3451010 3453060 Shut up!
3453180 3455890 You still don't get it, do you?
3455980 3461230 He'll find her. That's what he does.<br />That's all he does.
3461360 3466950 You can't stop him. He'll reach down<br />her throat and pull her fucking heart out!
3467070 3469580 - Doc.<br />- Let go ofme!
3473870 3475910 Sorry.
3479710 3481340 He's crazy?
3481460 3484880 In technical terminology, he's a loon.
3485590 3490970 Sarah, this is what they call body armour.<br />Our TAC guys wear these.
3491100 3493350 It'll stop a 1 2-gauge round.
3493470 3497730 This other man must've been wearing<br />one under his coat. Feel that.
3499610 3503530 - He punched through the windshield.<br />- He was probably on PCP.
3503650 3506360 Broke every bone in his hand.<br />He wouldn't feel it.
3506490 3508950 There was this guy once...<br />You see this scar?
3509070 3511120 Thank you.
3511240 3514830 There's a couch in this other room.<br />Stretch out and get some sleep.
3514950 3517500 Be at least an hour<br />before your mother gets here.
3517620 3520790 - I can't sleep.<br />- Try.
3520920 3525050 It may not look it,<br />but that couch is very comfortable.
3526380 3530510 You'll be perfectly safe.<br />We got 30 cops in this building.
3531600 3533640 Thank you.
3539440 3541480 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
3555950 3559620 I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.<br />I was told she's here. Could I see her?
3559750 3562290 No. Can't see her.<br />She's making a statement.
3562420 3564040 Where is she?
3564170 3568920 It make take a while. If you wanna wait,<br />there's a bench over there.
3578600 3580480 I'll be back.
3636070 3638120 Stay here.
3677410 3679450 Watch him.
3746690 3748520 Ed...
3776800 3779510 Sarah!
3779590 3781640 Reese.
3784770 3786180 This way.
3826850 3829390 KFLB news time. 4.36.
3829520 3832810 Top story - the largest single<br />law enforcement mobilisation
3832940 3836020 in California history<br />is currently underway.
3836150 3840030 Police in five counties are engaged<br />in a massive manhunt for...
3843490 3845530 Take this.
3847950 3850660 All right. Let's get this off the road.
3881570 3884820 - You cold?<br />- Freezing.
3898630 3900670 Reese?
3901590 3904050 - You got a first name?<br />- Kyle.
3905430 3909770 Kyle, what's it like<br />when you go through time?
3912560 3914600 White light.
3916810 3918860 Pain.
3921530 3925660 - It's like being born maybe.<br />- My God.
3926530 3928580 I caught one back there.
3929990 3932830 - You mean you got shot?<br />- It's not bad.
3933660 3937380 - We gotta get you to a doctor.<br />- It's OK. Forget it.
3937500 3942420 What do you mean, forget it?<br />Are you crazy? Take this off.
3954390 3956230 Jesus.
3956350 3958940 See? It passed right through the meat.
3959060 3961480 This is gonna make me puke.
3961610 3964780 - Would you just talk about something?<br />- What?
3964900 3969450 I don't know. Anything.<br />Just talk. Tell me about my son.
3970280 3972330 He's about my height.
3975540 3977790 He has your eyes.
3980880 3982920 What's he like?
3983050 3986760 You trust him. He's got a strength.
3988430 3990550 I'd die for John Connor.
3993350 3996940 Well, at least now I know<br />what to name him.
3998100 4002860 Don't suppose you know who the father is<br />so I won't tell him to get lost?
4002980 4005860 John never said much about him.
4005990 4009070 - I know he dies before the war...<br />- Wait.
4010530 4013240 I don't wanna know.
4013330 4016750 So was it John that sent you here?
4016870 4019580 I volunteered.
4019670 4024510 - Why?<br />- It was a chance to meet the legend.
4024630 4031470 Sarah Connor,<br />who taught her son to fight, organise,
4031600 4033760 prepare from when he was a kid.
4033890 4037600 When you were in hiding before the war.
4040020 4043480 You're talking about things<br />I haven't done yet in the past tense.
4043610 4046150 It's driving me crazy.
4049450 4051910 Are you sure you have the right person?
4052030 4054200 I'm sure.
4054330 4058250 Come on! Do I look like<br />the mother of the future?
4060040 4065000 I mean, am I tough? Organised?<br />I can't even balance my chequebook.
4068130 4072050 Look, Reese, I didn't ask<br />for this honour and I don't want it.
4072180 4074510 Any of it.
4076680 4081810 Your son gave me a message<br />to give to you. Made me memorise it.
4081940 4085020 Thank you, Sarah,<br />for your courage through the dark years.
4085150 4089820 I can't help you with what you must<br />soon face. The future is not set.
4089950 4092490 You must be stronger than<br />you imagine you can be.
4092610 4095950 You must survive or I will never exist.
4096080 4098120 That's all.
4100960 4103750 It's a good field dressing.
4103880 4105920 You like it?
4106040 4108300 It's my first.
4111840 4114550 Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.
4118560 4120560 OK.
4130400 4132650 Talk to me some more.
4135570 4138080 About what?
4138200 4140910 Tell me about where you're from.
4142870 4144920 All right.
4146290 4150840 You stay down by day,<br />but at night you can move around.
4150960 4156140 You still have to be careful<br />because the H-Ks use infrared.
4156850 4162430 But they're not too bright.<br />John taught us ways to dust them.
4163310 4166020 That's when the infiltrators<br />started to appear.
4166100 4169820 The Terminators were the newest.<br />The worst.
4179410 4184790 Traversing your sector in search mode.<br />750 metres north ofyour position.
4189340 4191380 Let's go.
4235880 4239050 - Reese. DN384...<br />- Right. Let him in.
4331190 4333980 Terminator!
4410520 4413640 I was dreaming about dogs.
4413770 4416860 We use 'em to spot Terminators.
4417610 4420860 Your world is pretty terrifying.
4458770 4462690 Hey, buddy,<br />you got a dead cat in there or what?
4470080 4472120 Fuck you, asshole.
4491100 4492930 God damn.
4493810 4495430 Thank you.
4500810 4502900 Is this enough?
4503030 4507150 Yeah, it's enough.<br />I don't wanna ask where you got it.
4512410 4514450 - I'm coming.<br />- We need a room.
4514580 4517710 - With a kitchen.<br />- Do you have one with a kitchen?
4533930 4536390 I am dying for a shower.
4538190 4540900 We should check your bandage, too.
4540980 4544570 Later. I'm going out for supplies.
4548450 4550490 Keep this.
4575430 4578980 No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.<br />I was told not to say.
4579100 4581190 I need to know where to reach you.
4581310 4586530 You tell me to hide out at the cabin<br />and you won't tell me what's going on?
4586650 4588900 I am worried sick here.
4589700 4593570 OK. OK, here's the number.
4593700 4595990 - You ready?<br />- Yes. Go ahead.
4596120 4602670 It's 408 555 1439. Room nine.
4602790 4604670 - Got it?<br />- I've got it.
4604790 4609170 I gotta go. I'm sorry<br />I can't tell you more right now.
4609300 4611340 I love you, Mom.
4614470 4617180 I love you, too, sweetheart.
4629110 4631650 - Tiki Motel.<br />- Give me your address there.
4635320 4637370 What have we got?
4640080 4646130 Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.
4646250 4648500 What's for dinner?
4648630 4651800 - Plastique.<br />- That sounds good.
4651920 4653970 What is it?
4654090 4657680 It's a nitroglycerin base.<br />It's a bit more stable.
4657810 4660680 I learned to make it when I was a kid.
4671690 4674400 Make sure there's none on the threads.
4675910 4677950 Like this.
4679410 4681660 Screw the end cap on.
4683160 4685420 Very gently.
4687460 4689920 You must've had a fun childhood.
4693510 4695340 That's good.
4695470 4700430 All right. Six more like that<br />and I'll get started on the fuses.
4710570 4713030 He'll find us, won't he?
4715280 4717320 Probably.
4734720 4737430 It'll never be over, will it?
4745350 4747600 Look at me. I'm shaking.
4748650 4753820 Some legend.<br />You must be pretty disappointed.
4754860 4758570 No, I'm not.
4767540 4771710 Kyle, the women in your time,
4772880 4775130 what are they like?
4777050 4779090 Good fighters.
4779220 4781930 That's not what I meant.
4783470 4785930 Was there someone special?
4787390 4789230 Someone...?
4789350 4791610 A girl, you know.
4793110 4795150 No.
4797490 4799530 Never.
4800610 4802660 Never?
4807200 4810500 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
4813670 4815710 So much pain.
4816880 4821340 Pain can be controlled.<br />You just disconnect it.
4821930 4824810 So you feel nothing?
4828980 4832060 John Connor gave me<br />a picture of you once.
4833730 4836820 I didn't know why at the time.
4836940 4842950 It was very old, torn, faded.
4846620 4853130 You were young like you are now.<br />You seemed just a little sad.
4854210 4858380 I used to always wonder<br />what you were thinking at that moment.
4858510 4862010 I memorised every line,
4862130 4864180 every curve.
4867560 4871390 I came across time for you, Sarah.
4871520 4875730 I love you. I always have.
4893620 4896080 I shouldn't have said that.
4986380 4989090 Think fast.
5077600 5079640 Trade places.
5089990 5093620 Faster. Drive faster.
5143250 5146420 Kyle. Oh, my God.
5214030 5216490 You stay here.
5239300 5241350 Let's get outta here.
5244140 5246390 Get out.
5262530 5265450 Kyle. Come on. Get up.
5275260 5276630 Come on.
5277720 5280590 Help me. Get out. Get out.
5304740 5307250 Don't stop. Run.
5439460 5441710 Sarah.
5441840 5443670 Kyle.
5453100 5456190 We did it, Kyle. We got him.
5475790 5477000 No.
5534720 5536230 Wait.
5540770 5543190 What are you doing?
5543320 5545650 Cover, so he can't track us.
5556160 5558620 Come on.
5559540 5563130 No. Kyle. Come on.
5563920 5567090 - Come on.<br />- Leave me here.
5576810 5581440 Move it, Reese. On your feet, soldier.
5581560 5585020 On your feet. Move it.
5657100 5659140 Get back. Go back.
5693510 5695380 - Run, Sarah.<br />- No.
5695510 5697260 Run.
5700510 5702350 Run.
5702470 5705100 Come on, motherfucker.
5817550 5819380 No.
5938040 5940300 You're terminated, fucker.
5997690 5999730 Kyle.
6020250 6023750 Seven. November 10. Where was l?
6024960 6028760 What's difficult is trying to decide<br />what to tell you and what not to.
6029260 6033600 But I guess I have a while before you're<br />old enough to understand these tapes.
6033720 6038690 They're more for me at this point<br />just so that I can get it straight.
6074640 6076680 Fill her up.
6080100 6082730 Should I tell you about your father?
6082860 6085110 Boy, that's a tough one.
6086610 6092280 Will it effect your decision to send him<br />here, knowing that he is your father?
6093240 6096120 If you don't send Kyle, you can never be.
6096240 6099330 God, a person could go crazy<br />thinking about this.
6103040 6106460 I suppose I will tell you.
6106590 6108840 I owe him that.
6111010 6113470 Maybe it'll help if...
6113590 6118770 you know that in the few hours<br />that we had together,
6120560 6123270 we loved a lifetime's worth.
6135870 6139620 - What did he just say?<br />- He says you're very beautiful.
6139750 6142830 He is ashamed to ask you<br />for five dollars for this picture.
6142960 6146290 But if he doesn't, his father will beat him.
6146420 6149420 Pretty good hustle, kid.
6165560 6167770 What did he just say?
6167900 6170980 He said there's a storm coming in.
6174490 6176530 I know.
