228978 233023 What the hell...?<br />Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...
248038 249039 What the hell...?
303636 305513 Hey, my turn.
314230 317900 Hey, what's wrong with this picture?
325783 327910 Nice night for a walk?
332623 333958 Nice night for a walk.
335042 339296 Wash day tomorrow.<br />Nothing clean, right?
339463 341006 Nothing clean. Right.
341173 344218 I think this guy's a couple of cans<br />short of a six-pack.
344385 349056 Your clothes, give them to me. Now.
349223 350724 Fuck you, asshole.
454453 458457 Hey, buddy, did you just see<br />a real bright light?
461210 462586 See that guy?
462753 463837 Hold it right there.
464004 465839 - He's rabbiting.<br />- Hey! I said hold it!
466006 467174 Go!
468717 471679 That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.
515556 518559 - What day is it? The date.<br />- 12th May.
518726 520519 - Thursday.<br />- What year?
534366 536035 He's got my gun. Let's go.
711293 713629 Guard it for me, Big Buns.
717090 719092 Hi. I'm late.
720052 721678 So am I.
764888 767182 - I'm in it.<br />- So am I.
773021 775899 - Honey, can I have that coffee now?<br />- Yes, sir.
776984 779444 - OK. Who gets the burly-beef?<br />- I ordered barbecued.
779611 781655 I think that's mine,<br />but I didn't order fries.
781822 784533 - Mine's the chili beef deluxe.<br />- OK, who gets the burly-beef?
784700 787536 - Miss, we're ready to order now.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
789788 791540 I'm so sorry.
794710 796586 This isn't real leather, is it?
799881 803051 Nice going, kid.<br />I ought to give you the tip.
805345 808223 Look at it this way.<br />In 100 years, who's gonna care?
816606 818775 The 12-gauge auto-loader.
820902 824781 That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.
825741 828493 The .45 long slide with laser sighting.
828660 831955 These are new. We just got them in.<br />That's a good gun.
832664 834416 Just touch the trigger,<br />the beam comes on,
834583 836418 and you put the red dot where<br />you want the bullet to go.
836585 838086 You can't miss.
840088 844092 - Anything else?<br />- Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.
844259 845886 Hey, just what you see, pal.
847179 848430 The Uzi nine millimeter.
849973 852225 You know your weapons, buddy.
852392 854561 Any one of these<br />is ideal for home defense.
855771 858774 So which Will it be?
858940 862444 - All.<br />- I may close early today.
862611 866948 It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,<br />but the rifles you can take now.
868116 870118 - You can't do that.<br />- Wrong.
897187 899940 Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.
900107 904403 Listen, I need you to come pick me up.<br />My bike just broke down.
904569 906822 I don't care what you're doing.<br />Come and get me. What the...?
908448 912619 Hey, man, you got<br />a serious attitude problem.
965714 968049 - Sarah Connor?<br />- Yes?
980687 983106 I'm on my break, Chuck.<br />Carla's got my station.
983273 986651 Sarah, come here. It's about you.<br />I mean, sort of.
989196 994451 So incredible. You're not gonna believe<br />this. Sit, you're going to love this.
994618 997746 - What?<br />- <i>...compiled from several witnesses.</i>
997913 1001082 <i>Once again, Sarah Connor,<br />35, mother of two,</i>
1001249 1003585 <i>brutally shot to death<br />in her home this afternoon.</i>
1003752 1005545 You're dead, honey.
1198947 1200949 <i>...if you're into sound,</i>
1201116 1205453 <i>for the greatest sound around,<br />come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.</i>
1205620 1209833 <i>We've got woofers, tweeters,<br />the newest in audio and compact discs.</i>
1209999 1212502 <i>We've got graphic equalizers<br />and sound balancers that...</i>
1236860 1238319 Sorry.
1250498 1252167 Hello?
1252333 1256379 <i>First I'm gonna rip the buttons<br />off your blouse one by one,</i>
1256546 1260967 <i>then run my tongue down your neck<br />to your bare, gleaming breasts.</i>
1261134 1266848 <i>And then slowly... slowly pull<br />your jeans off inch by inch.</i>
1268224 1269768 Ginger, it's Matt.
1269934 1273855 And lick your belly in circles<br />further and further down,
1274022 1277275 and then pull your panties off<br />with my teeth.
1277442 1278735 Who is this?
1280361 1282322 God. Sarah?
1283865 1286117 <i>Jesus. I'm sorry.</i>
1286284 1289078 I thought you were...<br />Can I talk to Ginger, please?
1289829 1290830 Sure.
1293458 1295043 It's the creep.
1296711 1297712 Hello?
1297879 1301424 First I'll rip the buttons off<br />your blouse one by one...
1303343 1308348 You fucking pigs! Wait till I get<br />my hands on you. Get off me!
1310350 1311601 Ed.
1313895 1315939 - What have you got?<br />- Dead girl.
1316105 1319609 - I can see that.<br />- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.
1319776 1323613 Shot six times at less than ten feet.<br />Large caliber weapon.
1323780 1325573 You know, these work.
1326950 1329619 - What's this?<br />- Dead girl two.
1329786 1332455 Sent over from the Valley division<br />this afternoon.
1334207 1336709 Are you sure there's<br />a point to all of this?
1336876 1338878 Look at the name, Ed.
1339629 1343216 Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?
1344926 1346094 You're kidding me.
1346261 1348847 The press is gonna be short-stroking it.
1349013 1353351 - A one-day pattern killer.<br />- I hate the weird ones.
1357981 1359816 So...
1361276 1363611 Better than mortal man deserves.
1370910 1375248 - Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?<br />- Not lately. Did you check messages?
1375415 1377250 I thought you did.
1382088 1385884 - <i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i><br />- <i>There you are,</i> young <i>man.</i>
1386050 1388219 You mind your mother.
1392348 1395977 <i>Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.<br />Something's come up.</i>
1396144 1399397 <i>Looks like I won't be able to make it<br />tonight. Just can't get out of it.</i>
1399564 1404319 <i>I'm really sorry. I'll make it up<br />to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.</i>
1406070 1409490 That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?
1409657 1413119 He can't treat you like this.<br />It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.
1414203 1416205 I'll live.
1416372 1418458 I'll break his kneecaps.
1419167 1423546 Well, Pugsley still loves me.<br />Don't you, baby?
1424464 1426758 God. It's disgusting.
1429010 1431554 I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.<br />Have a good time.
1431721 1434641 - We will. You, too.<br />- OK.
1438686 1440813 Damn it, Matt.
1497578 1500331 - Oh, shit.<br />- Lieutenant!
1500498 1504002 These killings occurred in the order<br />of their listings in the phone book.
1504168 1507088 - What can I tell you? No comment.<br />- But, Lieutenant...
1519559 1521644 That coffee's two hours cold.
1522895 1524814 I put a cigarette out in it.
1525982 1529318 - Did you reach the next girl yet?<br />- No. I got her answering machine.
1529485 1531779 - Send a unit.<br />- I sent a unit. There's no answer.
1531946 1534115 - The apartment manager's not in.<br />- Call her.
1534282 1536492 - I just called her.<br />- Call her again.
1537618 1539203 Give me a cigarette.
1549464 1554177 <i>Hi, there. Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.</i>
1554343 1559015 <i>But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need<br />love, too, so talk to it...</i>
1564353 1565813 Same shit.
1567148 1571235 I can hear it now. He's gonna be<br />called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
1571402 1576657 I hate these press cases.<br />Especially the weird press cases.
1578159 1580620 - Where are you going?<br />- To make a statement.
1580787 1582955 Maybe make these jackals work for us<br />for a change.
1583122 1587668 If I can get on the tube by 11:00,<br />maybe she'll call us.
1587835 1590421 Well, how do I look?
1590588 1593883 - Like shit, boss.<br />- Your mama.
1595009 1598179 <i>This just in. Police have announced<br />the name of the victim</i>
1598346 1602391 <i>in the second of two execution<br />style murders which took place today.</i>
1602558 1606354 <i>Incredibly, the names of the<br />two victims are virtually identical.</i>
1606521 1611067 <i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann<br />Connor was pronounced dead...</i>
1611818 1614028 - Can we change this?<br />- Sarah Louise Connor...
1614195 1615780 Don't touch it!
1617865 1622411 <i>Police are refusing to speculate on the<br />similarity between the shooting deaths</i>
1622578 1626666 <i>and no other connection between the<br />two victims has been established yet.</i>
1626833 1630211 <i>We'll have more on this<br />late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>
1721385 1723638 - Hey, you got a phone?<br />- It's in the back.
1723804 1726098 Hey, $4.50.
1765513 1768557 <i>You have reached the Los Angeles<br />Police Department emergency number.</i>
1768724 1773521 <i>All lines are busy. If you need a police<br />car sent out to you, stay on the line.</i>
1837793 1839170 Pugsley! Shoo!
1839337 1841964 Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.
1856771 1858606 Don't make me bust you up, man.
1919500 1922962 <i>Hi, there. Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.</i>
1923129 1926006 <i>But don't be shy. It's OK.<br />Machines need love, too.</i>
1926173 1930136 <i>So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,<br />or Sarah will get back to you.</i>
1930302 1931804 <i>Wait for the beep.</i>
1933264 1935266 <i>Ginger, this is Sarah.<br />Pick up if you're there.</i>
1935433 1941272 <i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard<br />called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.</i>
1941439 1946360 I think that there's somebody after me.<br />I hope that you play this back soon.
1946527 1949655 I need you and Matt to come<br />and pick me up as soon as possible.
1950406 1953534 The police keep transferring me around.<br />I'm gonna give 'em another try.
1953701 1957955 <i>The number here is 555-9175.</i>
1958122 1960040 <i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>
1977183 1978476 <i>It's her.</i>
1979810 1981979 Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.
1982146 1985399 Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and<br />don't transfer me to another department.
1985566 1988068 Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.<br />Can you tell me where you are?
1988235 1992072 - <i>I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.</i><br />- <i>Yeah,</i> I <i>know it. It's on</i> Pico.
1992239 1994783 - Are you all right?<br />- Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.
1994950 1998829 - I think there's a guy following me.<br />- Now, listen carefully.
1998996 2001373 You're in a public place so<br />you'll be safe till we get there.
2001540 2003834 But stay visible. Don't go outside<br />or even to the restroom.
2004001 2006754 <i>- I'll have a car there in a minute.<br />- OK.</i>
2031028 2032988 Hey, that guy didn't pay.
2192940 2194692 Come with me if you wanna live.
2203826 2204827 Come on!
2278108 2280694 This is one-L-19.<br />I got a hit-and-run felony.
2280861 2285199 Suspect vehicle: late model<br />gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh.
2285365 2287701 He's really moving,<br />punching lights all the way.
2287868 2291663 I'm gonna need an ambulance<br />at Seventh and Broadway right now.
2292998 2294041 Hold it!
2311183 2312100 Hold on.
2324071 2327741 Are you injured? Are you shot?
2333288 2336667 Do exactly what I say. Exactly.
2336834 2340379 Don't move unless I say.<br />Don't make a sound unless I say.
2340546 2341964 Do you understand?
2342881 2346510 - Do you understand?<br />- Yes! Please don't hurt me.
2364695 2366446 I'm hereto help you.
2366613 2371201 I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.<br />DN38416. Assigned to protect you.
2371368 2373078 You've been targeted for termination.
2383255 2387634 This is one-L-19. Westbound<br />on Olympic, approaching Overland.
2392306 2395767 This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.
2395934 2399646 No, but you will.<br />It's very important that you live.
2399813 2403191 This isn't true. How could that man<br />just get up after you...
2403358 2405736 It's not a man. A machine.
2405903 2409865 A Terminator.<br />Cyberdyne Systems model 101.
2417998 2421960 A machine? Like a robot?
2422127 2426632 Not a robot. A cyborg.<br />Cybernetic organism.
2426798 2429718 - No. He was bleeding.<br />- Just a second.
2433096 2434139 Get your head down!
2479101 2480185 All right, listen.
2480352 2484731 The Terminator's an infiltration unit.<br />Part man, part machine.
2484898 2488986 Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat<br />chassis. Microprocessor controlled.
2489152 2493782 Fully armored, very tough.<br />But outside it's living human tissue.
2493949 2498036 Flesh, skin, hair, blood...<br />grown for the cyborgs.
2498203 2500747 - Look, Reese, I don't know...<br />- Pay attention.
2500914 2502207 I gotta ditch this car.
2507838 2512009 The 600-Series had rubber skin.<br />We spotted them easy.
2512175 2514636 But these are new. They look human.
2514803 2518432 Sweat, bad breath, everything.<br />Very hard to spot.
2518598 2522310 I had to wait till he moved on you<br />before I could zero him.
2522477 2527941 Look, I am not stupid.<br />They cannot make things like that yet.
2528108 2532154 Not yet. Not for about 40 years.
2534781 2536700 Are you saying it's from the future?
2536867 2538952 One possible future.
2539953 2543248 From your point of view,<br />I don't know tech stuff.
2544416 2546626 Then you're from the future, too.<br />Is that right?
2546793 2548920 - Right.<br />- Right.
2557179 2562476 Cyborgs don't feel pain.<br />I do. Don't do that again.
2562642 2566480 - Just let me go.<br />- Listen and understand.
2566646 2570400 That Terminator is out there.
2570567 2574237 It can't be bargained with,<br />it can't be reasoned with.
2574905 2579117 It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear
2579284 2585165 and it absolutely will not stop,<br />ever, until you are dead.
2595342 2597219 Can you stop it?
2601473 2602808 I don't know.
2604684 2606937 With these weapons, I don't know.
2623453 2627749 <i>All units. Ford suspect vehicle has<br />been found in a parking structure...</i>
2671376 2675672 Reese, why me?
2677757 2679301 Why does it want me?
2685974 2688101 There was a nuclear war.
2690270 2692898 A few years from now...
2694608 2699362 ...all this, this whole place,<br />everything...
2700238 2704868 ...it's gone. Just gone.
2705911 2707621 There were survivors.
2707787 2710790 Here, there.
2712584 2715045 Nobody even knew who started it.
2717714 2722469 - It was the machines, Sarah.<br />- I don't understand.
2722636 2725764 Defense network computers.
2725931 2729100 New, powerful...
2730602 2734522 ...hooked into everything,<br />trusted to run it all.
2735315 2739736 They say it got smart...<br />a new order of intelligence.
2741488 2744658 Then it saw all people as a threat.<br />Not just the ones on the other side.
2746660 2749454 It decided our fate in a microsecond.
2751122 2752874 Extermination.
2767264 2768765 Did you see this war?
2781194 2785991 No. I grew up after. In the ruins.
2786157 2789202 Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.
2789369 2792372 - H-Ks?<br />- Hunter-killers.
2792539 2796293 Patrol machines<br />built in automated factories.
2796459 2800714 Most of us were rounded up,<br />put in camps for orderly disposal.
2802757 2805051 This was burned in by laser scanner.
2809014 2813560 Some of us were kept alive. To work.
2814519 2815895 Loading bodies.
2817022 2819733 The disposal units ran night and day.
2819899 2822777 We were that close<br />to going out forever.
2825864 2829743 But there was one man<br />who taught us to fight.
2829909 2831828 To storm the wire of the camps.
2831995 2835290 To smash those metal<br />motherfuckers into junk.
2836916 2839669 He turned it around.<br />He brought us back from the brink.
2839836 2844090 His name was Connor. John Connor.
2844257 2848720 Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.
2958496 2959497 Drive!
2966796 2967881 Reese!
2968715 2969883 Reese!
2987901 2991279 No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.
2991446 2994282 You in the Cadillac,<br />let me see your hands now.
2997452 2998453 Get out of the car.
3002207 3004417 Drop to your knees.
3004584 3007212 - Out of the car.<br />- Drop to the ground.
3036533 3040453 Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.
3043456 3045625 Listen, are you sure it's them?
3045792 3048586 I mean,<br />maybe I should look at the bodies.
3048753 3051631 No. They've been identified<br />and there's no doubt.
3055468 3057345 Ginger.
3058930 3062392 - Kiddo.<br />- Sarah...
3062559 3065728 - Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.<br />- Hi, Sarah.
3065895 3069941 I want you to tell him everything<br />Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?
3070108 3072193 Yeah, I guess so.
3073987 3077824 - You're a doctor?<br />- Criminal psychologist.
3077991 3082203 - Is Reese crazy?<br />- That's what we're gonna find out.
3167413 3170917 So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
3172418 3177465 With the 132nd under Perry.<br />From '21 to '27.
3178257 3180718 That's the year 2027?
3180885 3182970 <i>That's right. Then I was assigned...</i>
3183137 3186766 <i>- This is fucking great.<br />- ...under John Connor.</i>
3186933 3190019 - Who was the enemy?<br />- A computer defense system built...
3190186 3192730 Goddamn. Sorry.
3192897 3196234 ...built for SAC-NORAD<br />by Cyberdyne Systems.
3196401 3198361 I see.
3198528 3204409 And this computer thinks it can win<br />by killing the mother of its enemy.
3204575 3207787 Killing him, in effect,<br />before he's even conceived.
3207954 3210039 A sort of retroactive abortion?
3211833 3215086 Silberman cracks me up.<br />Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
3215253 3217755 - He screwed it first...<br />- Ed, shut up.
3217922 3220258 Why didn't the computer<br />just kill Connor then?
3220425 3222969 Why this elaborate scheme<br />with the Terminator?
3223136 3227223 It had no choice.<br />Their defense grid was smashed.
3227390 3231811 We'd won. Taking out Connor then<br />would make no difference.
3231978 3234772 Skynet had to wipe out<br />his entire existence.
3234939 3239986 Is that when you captured the lab<br />complex and found... What is it called?
3240153 3242321 The time displacement equipment?
3242488 3246534 That's right. The Terminator<br />had already gone through.
3246701 3249579 Connor sent me to intercept<br />and they blew the whole place.
3249746 3251581 Well, how are you supposed to get back?
3252457 3254167 I can't.
3255668 3261257 Nobody goes home.<br />Nobody else comes through.
3262008 3265094 It's just him and me.
3369532 3372368 <i>It's just him and me.</i>
3375454 3380418 <i>Why didn't you bring any weapons?<br />Something more advanced.</i>
3380585 3383546 <i>Don't you have ray guns?</i>
3383713 3387383 - <i>Ray</i> guns.<br /><i>- Show me a piece of future technology.</i>
3387550 3391929 <i>You go naked. Something about the<br />field generated by a living organism.</i>
3392096 3394140 <i>- Nothing dead will go.<br />- Why?</i>
3394307 3395975 <i>I didn't build the fucking thing.</i>
3396142 3400897 <i>OK, OK. But this cyborg,<br />if it's metal...?</i>
3401063 3403482 <i>- Surrounded by living tissue.<br />- Oh, right.</i>
3404275 3407028 This is great stuff.<br />I could make a career out of this guy.
3407194 3409989 See how clever it is?<br />It doesn't require a shred of proof.
3410156 3413618 Most paranoid delusions are intricate,<br />but this is brilliant.
3415953 3419916 <i>- Why were the other two women killed?<br />- Most records were lost in the war.</i>
3420082 3422668 <i>Skynet knew almost nothing<br />about Connor's mother.</i>
3422835 3426255 <i>Her full name, where she lived.<br />They just knew the city.</i>
3426422 3429508 <i>The Terminator was<br />just being systematic.</i>
3429675 3432511 <i>- Let's go back...<br />- Look, you have heard enough.</i>
3432678 3435640 <i>I have answered your questions,<br />now I have to see Sarah Connor.</i>
3435806 3439769 <i>- I'm afraid that's not up to me.<br />- Then why am I talking to you?</i>
3439936 3441771 <i>- Who is in authority here?<br />- Please...</i>
3441938 3443481 <i>Shut up!</i>
3444231 3446859 <i>You still don't get it, do you?</i>
3447026 3452114 <i>He'll find her. That's what he does.<br />That's all he does.</i>
3452281 3454033 <i>You can't stop him.</i>
3454200 3457828 <i>He'll reach down her throat<br />and pull her fucking heart out!</i>
3457995 3460957 <i>- Doc.<br />- Let go of me!</i>
3464418 3465419 Sorry.
3470841 3472218 So Reese is crazy?
3472385 3475888 In technical terminology, he's a loon.
3476722 3482186 Sarah, this is what they call<br />body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.
3482353 3484480 It'll stop a 12-gauge round.
3484647 3486857 This other individual must've<br />been wearing one under his coat.
3487024 3488693 Feel that. Go ahead.
3490987 3494573 - He punched through the windshield.<br />- He was probably on PCP.
3494740 3497410 Broke every bone in his hand.<br />He wouldn't feel it for hours.
3497576 3499161 There was this guy once...<br />You see this scar?
3499328 3500746 - Here.<br />- Thank you.
3502164 3505918 There's a couch in this other room.<br />Stretch out and get some sleep.
3506085 3508421 Be at least an hour before<br />your mother gets here from Big Bear.
3508587 3511674 - I can't sleep.<br />- Try.
3511841 3516095 It may not look it,<br />but that couch is very comfortable.
3517388 3521892 You'll be perfectly safe.<br />We got 30 cops in this building.
3522768 3524020 Thank you.
3530484 3532319 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
3547168 3550796 I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.<br />I was told she's here. Could I see her?
3550963 3553132 No. Can't see her.<br />She's making a statement.
3553299 3554425 Where is she?
3555384 3558179 It may take a while. If you wanna wait,<br />there's a bench over there.
3569732 3571233 I'll be back.
3619698 3622243 - Are they terrorists?<br />- Let's go, let's go!
3626914 3628290 Stay here.
3642513 3644056 Let's get outta here!
3668497 3669623 Watch him.
3737483 3738817 Ed...
3739693 3741028 Hey!
3767721 3769181 Sarah!
3770516 3771850 Reese.
3775771 3776939 This way.
3817730 3820399 <i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>
3820566 3824278 <i>Top story of the hour: the largest<br />single law enforcement mobilization</i>
3824445 3827031 <i>in California history<br />is currently underway.</i>
3827197 3830784 <i>Police in five counties are engaged<br />in a massive manhunt for...</i>
3834371 3835748 Take this.
3838834 3840544 All right,<br />let's get this off the road.
3872534 3875412 - You cold?<br />- Freezing.
3889385 3890552 Reese?
3892471 3896183 - You got a first name?<br />- Kyle.
3896350 3900646 Kyle, what's it like<br />when you go through time?
3903482 3905317 White light.
3907778 3909113 Pain.
3912408 3916662 - It's like being born maybe.<br />- Oh, my God.
3917579 3919498 I caught one back there.
3921083 3923836 - You mean you got shot?<br />- It's not bad.
3924711 3928173 - We gotta get you to a doctor.<br />- It's OK. Forget it.
3928340 3933011 What do you mean, forget it?<br />Are you crazy? Take this off.
3945274 3947276 Jesus.
3947443 3950320 See? It passed right through the meat.
3950487 3952114 This is gonna make me puke.
3952865 3955659 - Would you just talk about something?<br />- What?
3955826 3959288 I don't know. Anything.<br />Just talk. Tell me about my son.
3961123 3962708 He's about my height.
3966378 3968380 He has your eyes.
3971717 3973302 What's he like?
3974094 3977764 You trust him. He's got a strength.
3979475 3981351 I'd die for John Connor.
3984271 3987900 Well, at least now I know<br />what to name him.
3989067 3993822 Don't suppose you know who the father is<br />so I won't tell him to get lost?
3993989 3996742 John never said much about him.
3996909 3999411 - I know he dies before the war...<br />- Wait.
4001330 4003123 I don't wanna know.
4004416 4007127 So was it John that sent you here?
4007836 4009379 I volunteered.
4010631 4014426 - Why?<br />- It was a chance to meet the legend.
4015511 4022351 Sarah Connor,<br />who taught her son to fight, organize,
4022518 4024603 prepare from when he was a kid.
4024770 4026813 When you were in hiding before the war.
4030943 4034363 You're talking about things<br />I haven't done yet in the past tense.
4034530 4036406 It's driving me crazy.
4040285 4043038 Are you sure you have the right person?
4043205 4045249 I'm sure.
4045415 4049127 Come on. Do I look like<br />the mother of the future?
4050963 4055801 I mean, am I tough? Organized?<br />I can't even balance my checkbook.
4058595 4062724 Look, Reese, I didn't ask<br />for this honor and I don't want it.
4062891 4064351 Any of it.
4067646 4071858 Your son gave me a message<br />to give to you. Made me memorize it.
4073193 4075904 "Thank you, Sarah,<br />for your courage through the dark years.
4076071 4078198 I can't help you with<br />what you must soon face,
4078365 4080659 except to say the future is not set.
4080826 4083328 You must be stronger than<br />you imagine you can be.
4083495 4085998 You must survive or I will never exist."
4087332 4088792 That's all.
4091753 4093297 It's a good field dressing.
4094840 4096341 You like it?
4097092 4098510 It's my first.
4102806 4105183 Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.
4109438 4110689 OK.
4121366 4123285 Talk to me some more.
4126538 4128081 About what?
4129291 4131418 Tell me about where you're from.
4133879 4135380 All right.
4137299 4141803 You stay down by day,<br />but at night you can move around.
4141970 4145891 You still have to be careful<br />because the H-Ks use infrared.
4148018 4153065 But they're not too bright.<br />John taught us ways to dust them.
4154524 4156777 That's when the infiltrators<br />started to appear.
4156943 4158987 The Terminators were the newest.
4159613 4160530 <i>The worst.</i>
4170582 4175170 <i>Traversing your sector in search mode.<br />750 meters north of your position.</i>
4180133 4181259 Let's go.
4226722 4230684 - Reese. DN384...<br />- Right. Let him in.
4322192 4324069 Terminator!
4401313 4403648 I was dreaming about dogs.
4404900 4407277 We use 'em to spot Terminators.
4408361 4410906 Your world is pretty terrifying.
4449694 4453615 Hey, buddy,<br />you got a dead cat in there or what?
4460956 4463124 Fuck you, asshole.
4481977 4483812 God damn.
4484896 4486356 Thank you.
4491736 4493238 Is this enough?
4493905 4497075 Yeah, it's enough.<br />I don't wanna ask where you got it.
4503415 4504916 - I'm coming.<br />- We need a room.
4505083 4507085 - All right.<br />- With a kitchen.
4507252 4508712 Do you have one with a kitchen?
4524769 4527605 I am dying for a shower.
4529232 4531401 We should check your bandage, too.
4531985 4534654 Later. I'm going out for supplies.
4539367 4540535 Keep this.
4566603 4569981 No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.<br />I was told not to say.
4570148 4572317 <i>But I need to know where to reach you.</i>
4572484 4577614 <i>You tell me to hide out at the cabin<br />and you won't tell me what's going on?</i>
4577781 4580533 <i>I am worried sick here.</i>
4580700 4584454 OK. OK, here's the number.
4584621 4586831 - You <i>ready?</i><br />- Yes. Go ahead.
4586998 4593671 <i>It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.</i>
4593838 4595590 <i>- Got it?<br />- I've got it.</i>
4595757 4599928 <i>I gotta go. I'm sorry<br />I can't tell you more right now.</i>
4600095 4601846 <i>I love you, Mom.</i>
4605350 4607227 I love you, too, sweetheart.
4620115 4622534 - <i>Tiki Motel.</i><br />- Give me your address there.
4626204 4627288 What have we got?
4631000 4637132 Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.
4637298 4638925 What's for dinner?
4639634 4642720 - Plastique.<br />- That sounds good.
4642887 4644264 What is it?
4645181 4648726 It's a nitroglycerin base.<br />It's a bit more stable.
4648893 4650770 I learned to make it when I was a kid.
4662657 4664784 Make sure there's none on the threads.
4666995 4668413 Like this.
4670373 4672167 Screw the end cap on.
4674085 4675628 Very gently.
4678381 4680675 You must've had a fun childhood.
4684387 4685763 That's good.
4686723 4689767 All right. Six more like that<br />and I'll get started on the fuses.
4701237 4703198 He'll find us, won't he?
4706201 4707702 Probably.
4725803 4727931 It'll never be over, will it?
4736356 4738358 Look at me. I'm shaking.
4739567 4744656 Some legend.<br />You must be pretty disappointed.
4745740 4749661 No, I'm not.
4758378 4763675 Kyle, the women in your time,
4763841 4765927 what are they like?
4768012 4770098 Good fighters.
4770265 4772308 That's not what I meant.
4774477 4776312 Was there someone special?
4778356 4779899 Someone...?
4780525 4782694 A girl, you know.
4784195 4785571 No.
4788366 4789993 Never.
4791577 4793204 Never?
4798167 4801546 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
4804424 4806509 So much pain.
4807885 4812223 Pain can be controlled.<br />You just disconnect it.
4812390 4814642 So you feel nothing?
4819814 4822734 John Connor gave me<br />a picture of you once.
4824652 4826446 I didn't know why at the time.
4827905 4833745 It was very old, torn, faded.
4837582 4843588 You were young like you are now.<br />You seemed just a little sad.
4845131 4847884 I used to always wonder<br />what you were thinking at that moment.
4849344 4851554 I memorized every line...
4853056 4854932 ...every curve.
4858603 4860521 I came across time for you, Sarah.
4862440 4866736 I love you. I always have.
4884796 4886464 I shouldn't have said that.
4977346 4978556 Think fast.
5068604 5069939 Trade places.
5080950 5084287 Faster! Drive faster!
5134211 5137381 Kyle! Oh, my God.
5171624 5172958 Kyle.
5188224 5189600 Son-of-a-bitch!
5205282 5206283 You stay here.
5230266 5231434 Let's get outta here.
5235104 5236355 Get out.
5253497 5256459 Kyle. Come on. Get up.
5265009 5267553 Kyle, come on.
5268679 5271557 Help me! Get out. Get out.
5296040 5298000 Don't stop. Run!
5430174 5431717 Sarah!
5432760 5434386 Kyle.
5439683 5442227 Kyle. Kyle...
5444313 5447066 We did it, Kyle. We got him.
5466794 5467878 No!
5468379 5469713 No!
5525602 5526895 Wait.
5531734 5533360 What are you doing?
5534236 5537406 Cover, so he can't track us.
5547124 5550294 Come on! Come on.
5550461 5554131 No, Kyle! Come on!
5554882 5556633 - Come on!<br />- Leave me here.
5567770 5572149 Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!
5572483 5574651 On your feet!
5575277 5576445 Move it!
5648142 5649810 Get back. Go back.
5684344 5686138 - Run, Sarah.<br />- No.
5686305 5687598 Run!
5691435 5693020 Run!
5693604 5695147 Come on, motherfucker.
5808135 5810304 No.
5928797 5930465 You're terminated, fucker.
5988648 5989900 Kyle.
6010921 6014925 Tape seven. November 10. Where was I?
6015884 6019721 What's most difficult is trying to<br />decide what to tell you and what not to.
6020430 6024434 But I guess I have a while before you're<br />old enough to understand these tapes.
6024601 6028355 They're more for me at this point<br />just so that I can get it straight.
6065475 6066810 Fill her up.
6070480 6073608 Should I tell you about your father?
6073775 6076027 Boy, that's a tough one.
