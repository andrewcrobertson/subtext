257030 258860 What the hell?
312470 314580 Hey, my turn!
316990 318550 Me.
321160 322630 Come on.
322890 325760 Hey, what's wrong<br />with this picture?
334560 336870 Nice night for a walk, eh?
341510 343650 Nice night for a walk.
343710 348200 Washday tomorrow.<br />Nothing clean, right?
348270 350070 Nothing clean. Right.
350140 353190 I think this guy's a couple<br />cans short of a six-pack.
353360 354670 Your clothes.
355590 357490 Give them to me. Now.
358230 359950 Fuck you, asshole!
390490 392930 Hey, sugar, how about it?
393500 398140 I don't have to put up<br />with that bullshit, man.
398200 400600 She's always after me.
401170 402810 I don't... I don't...
463170 467470 Hey, buddy. Did you just<br />see a real bright light?
469820 471190 See that guy?
471260 473480 - Hold it right there!<br />- He's rabbiting.
473540 476510 - Hey! I said hold it!<br />- Go!
477380 480550 That son of a bitch took my pants!
524130 528360 - What day is it? The date!<br />- 12th... May. Thursday.
528430 530770 - What year?!<br />- What?
543200 545620 He's got my gun! Let's go!
630700 634150 <i>3831, they lost the suspect.</i>
720160 722410 Guard it for me, big buns.
725050 727980 - Hi.<br />- Hi. I'm late.
728950 730270 So am I.
774040 776130 - I'm in it.<br />- So am I.
781770 783550 Honey, could I have<br />that coffee now, please?
783560 784690 Yes, sir.
785720 788420 - OK, who gets the burly beef?<br />- Uh, I ordered barbecued beef.
788430 790730 - I think that's mine, but I didn't order fries.<br />- He gets the barbecued beef.
790790 793510 - Mine's the chili beef deluxe.<br />- OK, who gets the burly beef?
793580 796170 - Miss, we're ready to order now.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
796330 797330 Aah!
798130 801570 Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, lord.
803640 805690 This isn't real leather, is it?
806760 808040 This special sucks.
808110 811580 Nice going, kid. Ought<br />to give you the tip.
814180 817520 Look at it this way... in a hundred<br />years, who's going to care?
825500 827460 The twelve-gauge auto-loader.
829870 833640 That's Italian. You<br />can go pump or auto.
834500 837360 The .45 long slide,<br />with laser sighting.
837430 840910 These are brand-new. We just<br />got them in. That's a good gun.
841480 844150 Just touch the trigger, the beam<br />comes on, and you put the red dot
844150 846970 where you want the bullet<br />to go. You can't miss.
848970 850320 Anything else?
850390 852820 A phased plasma rifle<br />in the 40-watt range.
852990 854920 Just what you see, pal.
856080 857940 The Uzi 9mm.
859010 863580 You know your weapons, buddy. Any one<br />of these is ideal for home defense.
864350 867640 So, uh... which will it be?
867800 868850 All.
869220 871420 I may close early today.
871590 876030 There's a 15-day wait on the handguns,<br />but the rifles you can take right now.
876600 878110 You can't do that.
878580 879800 Wrong.
906010 908980 Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.
909050 912720 Listen, I need you to come pick<br />me up. My bike just broke down.
913280 916190 I don't care what you're doing.<br />Come and get me. What the...
917150 921410 Hey, man, you got a<br />serious attitude problem.
974340 977210 - Sarah Connor?<br />- Yes?
989560 992030 I'm on my break, Chuck.<br />Carla's got my station.
992030 995400 Sarah, come here!<br />It's about you. I mean, sort of.
998220 1000280 It's so incredible. You're<br />not gonna believe this.
1000300 1002360 Sit down. You are<br />going to love this.
1002410 1004210 - Shh!<br />- What?
1004210 1006770 <i>Has been compiled<br />from several witnesses.</i>
1006780 1009980 <i>Once again, Sarah Connor,<br />thirty-five, mother of two,</i>

1306880 1310150 First, I'm gonna rip the buttons<br />off your blouse, one by one...
1312470 1316050 You fuckin' pigs! Wait till<br />I get my hands on you!
1316120 1318450 - Get off of me!<br />- Sit down, fella.
1319220 1320450 Ed.
1322690 1324790 - What do you got?<br />- Dead girl.
1324860 1328560 - I can see that.<br />- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35,
1328630 1332570 shot six times at less than ten<br />feet. Large caliber weapon.
1332640 1334200 You know, these work.
1335770 1337300 What's this?
1337370 1340910 Dead girl 2, sent over from<br />Valley Division this afternoon.
1343050 1347500 - I'm sure there's a point to all of this.<br />- Look at the name, Ed.
1348270 1352420 Sarah Louise... Connor.<br />Is this right?
1353760 1355160 You're kidding me.
1355220 1357930 The press is going to be<br />short-stroking it all over the place.
1357990 1359820 A one-day pattern killer.
1361040 1362210 I hate the weird ones.
1366900 1368370 So...
1370210 1372170 Better than mortal man deserves.
1379750 1383920 - Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?<br />- No, not lately. Did you check messages?
1384090 1385750 Uh-uh. I thought you did.
1390160 1392130 <i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>
1392190 1394620 There you are, young man.
1394640 1399180 - You mind your mother.<br /><i>- So call me back, will you, dear? Uh, bye.</i>
1400950 1404220 <i>Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.<br />Uh, something's come up,</i>
1404220 1406720 <i>and it looks like I won't<br />be able to make it tonight.</i>
1406790 1410260 <i>Just can't get out of it. Look, I'm<br />really sorry. I'll make it up to you.</i>
1410330 1413260 <i>Call you in a day or so,<br />OK? Sorry. Bye.</i>
1414730 1418140 That bum. So what if<br />he has a Porsche?
1418200 1421610 He can't treat you like this. It's<br />Friday night, for Christ's sake!
1423080 1424740 I'll live.
1425110 1427310 I'll break his kneecaps.
1428080 1432050 Well... Pugsley still loves<br />me, don't you, baby?
1433190 1435850 God. It's disgusting.
1437620 1439470 - I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.<br />- OK.
1439540 1442680 - You and Matt have a good time.<br />- We will. You, too.
1442740 1443760 OK.
1447850 1449650 Damn it, Matt!
1506290 1507820 Oh, shit.
1507890 1510690 Lieutenant, are you aware<br />that these two killings
1510690 1513000 occurred in the same order as<br />their listings in the phone book?
1513060 1515300 Now, what can I tell you<br />guys? No comment.
1515370 1517170 But, lieutenant, we've<br />got two murders...
1528310 1531680 - That coffee's two hours cold.<br />- Mm-hmm.
1531750 1533620 I put a cigarette out in it.
1534890 1538220 - Did you reach the next girl yet?<br />- No. I keep getting an answering machine.
1538290 1539660 - Send a unit.<br />- I sent a unit.
1539690 1542190 There's no answer at the door, and<br />the apartment manager's not home.
1542260 1543070 Call her.
1543090 1545280 - I just called her.<br />- Call her again.
1545900 1547390 Give me a cigarette.
1558290 1559660 <i>Hi there.</i>
1560330 1565130 <i>Ha ha ha. Fooled you. You're talking to<br />a machine, but don't be shy, it's OK.</i>
1573220 1574460 Same shit.
1576130 1580130 I can hear it now. He's gonna be called<br />the goddamn "Phone Book killer."
1580200 1585370 I hate these press cases,<br />especially the weird press cases.
1586800 1589490 - Where you going?<br />- To make a statement.
1589660 1592020 Maybe make these jackals<br />work for us for a change.
1592090 1596280 If I can get on the tube by eleven<br />o'clock, maybe she'll call us.
1596650 1597880 Well...
1598350 1601070 - How do I look?<br />- Like shit, boss.
1601340 1602540 Your mama.
1602840 1603910 Lieutenant!
1603940 1607090 <i>This just in. Police have<br />announced the name of the victim</i>
1607160 1611080 <i>in the second of two execution-style<br />murders which took place today.</i>
1611140 1615550 <i>Incredibly, the names of the two<br />victims are virtually identical.</i>
1615550 1619700 <i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann<br />Connor was pronounced dead at the scene</i>
1619720 1621790 <i>- in her Santa Monica apartment...</i><br />- Can we change this?
1621810 1623350 - Sure.<br /><i>- Sarah Louise Connor was slain by an...</i>
1623370 1626830 - Don't touch it!<br /><i>- Unknown gunman earlier today in her home.</i>
1626890 1629650 <i>Now, police are refusing to speculate<br />on the apparent similarity</i>
1629650 1633380 <i>between these shooting deaths, and no<br />other connection between the two victims</i>
1633380 1635580 <i>has been established as of yet.</i>
1635590 1639290 <i>Of course, we'll have more on this<br />late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

1861960 1863400 Whoa!
1865670 1867630 Don't make me bust you up, man!
1928180 1930350 <i>Hi there. Ha ha ha. Fooled you.</i>

1944580 1949750 <i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard<br />called Technoir. I'm really scared.</i>
1949770 1952400 I think that there's<br />somebody's after me.

1955420 1958740 <i>I need you and Matt to come and<br />pick me up as soon as possible.</i>
1958810 1962630 The police keep transferring me around.<br />I'm gonna give them another try.

1966860 1968760 <i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>
1986400 1987770 It's her.
1988770 1992890 - Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.<br />- <i>Look, Lieutenant,</i> don't put me on hold
1992890 1995990 - and don't transfer me to another department!<br />- Don't worry. I won't. Now, just relax.
1996020 1999070 - Can you tell me where you are?<br /><i>- I'm in this bar called Technoir.</i>
1999090 2001820 Yeah, I know. It's on Pico.<br />Are you all right?
2001850 2005230 Yeah, but I don't want to leave.<br />I think there's a guy following me.
2005250 2007740 All right, now, listen, Miss<br />Connor, now, listen carefully,
2007760 2010320 you're in a public place, so<br />you'll be safe till we get there,
2010320 2013160 but stay visible. Don't go outside<br />or even to the rest room.
2013160 2015560 <i>- I'll have a car there in a hot minute.</i><br />- OK.
2039990 2042320 Hey, that guy didn't pay.
2201720 2203600 Come with me if you want to live.
2213010 2214760 Come on!
2286950 2289640 This is 1-L19. I got a<br />hit-and-run felony.
2289710 2294130 Suspect vehicle... late model gray<br />Ford, headed westbound on 7th.
2294190 2296560 He's really moving, punching<br />lights all the way.
2296630 2300950 I'm going to need an ambulance<br />at 7th and Broadway right now.
2301920 2303120 Hold it!

2319970 2321200 Hold on.
2332960 2336250 Are you injured? Are you shot?
2338700 2340050 No!
2342090 2345060 Do exactly what I say. Exactly.
2345530 2349400 Don't move unless I say. Don't<br />make a sound unless I say.
2349460 2351100 Do you understand?
2351670 2355320 - Do you understand?!<br />- Yes! Yes! Please, don't hurt me.
2373520 2377290 I'm here to help you. I'm<br />Reese, Sergeant Techcom,
2377290 2382180 DN38416, assigned to protect you.<br />You've been targeted for termination.
2387500 2390900 <i>Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.</i>
2391970 2396640 This is 1-L19. Westbound on<br />Olympic approaching Overland.
2401150 2404430 This is a mistake.<br />I didn't do anything.
2404450 2408110 No, but you will. It's very<br />important that you live.
2408430 2412180 This isn't true. How could that<br />man just get up after you...
2412180 2414650 He's not a man. A machine.
2414900 2419100 A Terminator. A Cyberdine<br />systems model 101.
2427020 2428400 A machine?
2429520 2433950 - Like a robot?<br />- Not a robot. A cyborg.
2434210 2435790 A cybernetic organism.
2435820 2438750 - No. He was bleeding.<br />- Just a second.
2441920 2443270 Get your head down!
2487980 2491450 All right, listen. The Terminator's<br />an infiltration unit...
2491520 2496120 part man, part machine. Underneath,<br />it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...
2496190 2499950 microprocessor controlled,<br />fully armored, very tough.
2499950 2502380 But outside, it's<br />living human tissue.
2502720 2506870 Flesh, skin, hair, blood...<br />grown for the cyborgs.
2506940 2508440 Look, Reese, I don't know<br />what you want from...
2508510 2511670 Pay attention! I got<br />to ditch this car.
2516950 2520900 The 600 series had rubber<br />skin. We spotted them easy.
2520970 2523540 But these are new.<br />They look human...
2523600 2527620 Sweat, bad breath, everything.<br />Very hard to spot.
2527790 2530590 I had to wait till he moved on<br />you before I could zero him.
2531160 2537260 Look... I am not stupid, you know.<br />They cannot make things like that yet.
2537280 2541350 Not yet. Not for about forty years.
2543620 2548190 - Are you saying it's from the future?<br />- One possible future.
2548660 2551780 From your point of view...<br />I don't know tech stuff.
2553120 2555920 Then you're from the future,<br />too, is that right?
2555990 2558170 - Right.<br />- Right.
2566050 2569600 Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.
2569870 2571350 Don't do that again.
2571420 2573850 - Just let me go.<br />- Listen!
2574020 2578510 And understand. That<br />Terminator is out there.
2579410 2583780 It can't be bargained with.<br />It can't be reasoned with.
2583850 2588080 It doesn't feel pity<br />or remorse or fear.
2588150 2591820 And it absolutely<br />will not stop. Ever!
2592190 2594670 Until you are dead.
2604100 2606000 Can you stop it?
2610090 2611690 I don't know.
2613390 2616280 With these weapons, I don't know.
2632410 2635330 <i>All units. All units. Gray Ford<br />suspect vehicle's been found</i>
2635330 2638000 <i>in a parking structure<br />at 4th and Beaudry.</i>
2680090 2681330 Reese.
2682410 2684380 Why me?
2686420 2688430 Why does it want me?
2694910 2697010 There was a nuclear war...
2698810 2701010 A few years from now.
2703550 2705080 All this...
2705450 2708660 This whole place. Everything.
2709320 2710890 It's gone.
2712560 2714230 Just gone.
2714590 2716500 There were survivors.
2716660 2719120 Here. There.
2721520 2723720 Nobody even knew who started it.
2726520 2728790 It was the machines, Sarah.
2730060 2734200 - I don't understand.<br />- Defense network computers.
2735030 2738600 New... powerful...
2739170 2743610 Hooked into everything.<br />Trusted to run it all.
2743970 2749230 They say it got smart...<br />a new order of intelligence.
2750000 2754450 Then it saw <i>all</i> people as a threat,<br />not just the ones on the other side.
2755520 2758420 Decided our fate in<br />a microsecond...
2759990 2761760 extermination.
2776040 2778270 Did you see this war?
2790020 2793440 No. I grew up after it...
2793510 2796740 In the ruins. Starving...
2796810 2799160 - Hiding from HKs.<br />- HKs?
2799230 2804280 Hunter-killers. Patrol machines<br />built in automated factories.
2804950 2809770 Most of us were rounded up, put<br />in camps for orderly disposal.
2811440 2814290 This was burned in<br />by laser scanner.
2818080 2822500 Some of us were<br />kept alive... to work...
2823370 2828820 Loading bodies. The disposal<br />units ran night and day.
2828890 2832260 We were that close<br />to going out forever.
2834730 2838600 But there was one man<br />who taught us to fight,
2838670 2844470 to storm the wire of the camps, to smash<br />those metal motherfuckers into junk.
2845440 2848640 He turned it around. He brought<br />us back from the brink.
2848650 2852850 His name was Connor. John Connor.
2853380 2854980 Your son, Sarah.
2856020 2858050 Your unborn son.
2967700 2969110 Drive!
2975940 2979010 Reese!
2996790 3000290 No, Reese! No! No!<br />No! They'll kill you.
3000360 3003710 You in the Cadillac!<br />Let me see your hands now!
3006250 3007820 Get out of the car!
3011490 3013360 Drop to your knees!
3013730 3016490 - Out of the car.<br />- Drop to the ground.
3045120 3046820 Sarah...
3047090 3049490 Sarah, try to drink some of this.
3052160 3057180 Listen, are you sure it's them? Maybe...<br />maybe I should look at the bodies.
3057350 3060090 No. They've been identified,<br />and there's no doubt.
3060160 3062320 Oh, God.
3062320 3063990 God!
3064060 3066160 Ginger!
3069400 3070830 Sarah.
3071670 3074500 - Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.<br />- Hi, Sarah.
3074570 3077560 I want you to tell him<br />everything that Reese told you.
3077620 3081190 - Do you feel up to that?<br />- Yeah. I guess so.
3082830 3084500 You're a doctor?
3084960 3088620 - Criminal psychologist.<br />- Is Reese crazy?
3088680 3091110 Well, that's what<br />we're gonna find out.
3176300 3180010 So, you're a soldier,<br />fighting for whom?
3181440 3186880 With the 132nd, under<br />Perry. From '21 to '27.
3187050 3191800 - That's the year 2027?<br />- That's right. And I was assigned...
3191870 3193470 This is fucking great.
3193540 3195860 The last two years<br />under John Connor.
3195880 3199190 - Who was the enemy again?<br />- A computer defense system built for...
3199190 3201710 Oh, damn. Sorry.
3201750 3205080 Built for SAC-NORAD<br />by Cyberdine systems.
3205150 3206580 I see.
3207150 3213120 And this, uh, computer thinks it can win<br />by killing the mother of its enemy,
3213290 3216840 killing him, in effect,<br />before he's even conceived,
3216910 3219210 a sort of retroactive abortion?
3220580 3222010 That guy Silberman cracks me up.
3222080 3224840 Last week, he had this guy in here that<br />burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,
3224870 3226820 - then he set it on fire.<br />- Hey, shut up.
3226890 3229010 Why didn't the computer<br />just kill Connor then?
3229070 3231980 Why this elaborate scheme<br />with the Terminator?
3232040 3236300 It had no choice. Their<br />defense grid was smashed.
3236360 3240520 We'd won. Taking out Connor<br />then would make no difference.
3240790 3243870 Skynet had to wipe out<br />his entire existence.
3243940 3247820 Is that when you captured the lab complex<br />and found that... uh, what is it called?
3247890 3250990 Uh... the time<br />displacement equipment?
3251260 3255370 That's right. The Terminator<br />had already gone through.
3255530 3258840 Connor sent me to intercept,<br />and they blew the whole place.
3259000 3261020 How are you supposed get back?
3261150 3262710 I can't.
3264390 3266390 Nobody goes home.
3267900 3273930 Nobody else comes through.<br />It's just him and me.
3378720 3381540 It's just him and me.
3384130 3389060 Why didn't you bring any weapons,<br />something more advanced?
3389130 3392070 Don't you have ray guns?
3392840 3393900 Ray guns.
3393970 3396510 Show me a piece of<br />future technology.
3396570 3400820 You go naked. Something about the<br />field generated by a living organism.
3400880 3403050 - Nothing dead will go.<br />- Why?
3403110 3407380 - I didn't build the fucking thing!<br />- OK, OK. But this...
3407450 3410990 - Cyborg, if it's metal...<br />- Surrounded by living tissue!
3411060 3412240 Oh. Right, right...
3413110 3416040 This is great stuff. I could<br />make a career out of this guy.
3416110 3418980 You see how clever this part is? How<br />it doesn't require a shred of proof?
3418980 3423050 And most paranoid delusions are<br />intricate, but this is brilliant.
3424350 3426730 Why were the other<br />two women killed?
3426760 3428930 Most of the records<br />were lost in the war.
3428970 3433840 Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's<br />mother. Her full name, where she lived.
3433860 3437500 They just knew the city. The<br />Terminator was just being systematic.
3437550 3441340 - Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to...<br />- Look, you have heard enough!
3441470 3444900 I have answered your questions!<br />Now I have to see Sarah Connor!
3444910 3448360 - I'm afraid that's not up to me.<br />- Then why am I talking to you?
3448430 3450430 - Because I can help you.<br />- Who is in authority here?
3450450 3452260 - Reese...<br />- Shut up!
3452830 3455400 You still don't get it, do you?
3455570 3459000 He'll find her.<br />That's what he does!
3459070 3462810 That's all he does!<br />You can't stop him!
3462810 3467040 He'll wade through you, reach down her<br />throat, and pull her fucking heart out!
3467080 3469830 - Doc.<br />- Let... let go of me!
3473480 3474850 Sorry.
3479760 3483410 - So, Reese is crazy?<br />- In technical terminology...
3483580 3485140 He's a loon.
3485510 3488920 Sarah, this is what<br />they call body armor.
3489280 3493390 Our TAC guys wear these. It'll<br />stop a twelve-gauge round.
3493450 3498130 This other individual must have been wearing<br />one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.
3499790 3501830 What about when he punched<br />through the windshield?
3501890 3504510 He was probably on PCP.<br />Broke every bone in his hand
3504580 3507410 and wouldn't feel it for hours.<br />There was this guy once...
3507440 3508950 - You see this scar?<br />- Here.
3509020 3510490 Thank you.
3510850 3514970 There's a couch in this other room. Why don't<br />you stretch out and try to get some sleep?
3515040 3517520 It'll be at least an hour before your<br />mother gets here from Big Bear.
3517580 3520510 - I can't sleep.<br />- Try.
3520680 3524830 Well, it may not look it, but<br />that couch is very comfortable.
3526200 3531010 You'll be perfectly safe. We got<br />thirty cops in this building.
3531880 3533240 Thank you.
3538850 3541250 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
3555560 3557570 I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
3557600 3559760 I was told that she's here.<br />Could I see her, please?
3559780 3562440 No. You can't see her.<br />She's making a statement.
3562460 3565220 - Where is she?<br />- Look, it may take a while...
3565250 3567550 if you want to wait, there's<br />a bench over there.
3578450 3580410 I'll be back.
3607230 3609240 What the hell was that?
3618560 3619850 Gunshot!
3628620 3631530 - What is it, terrorists?<br />- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
3635780 3637680 Stay here.
3651340 3652400 Let's get out of here!
3652430 3655410 - Come on! Come on!<br />- He's got an automatic weapon!
3657950 3660040 Move it, move it, move it, move it!
3670660 3672710 What the hell happened<br />to the lights?
3677320 3678790 Watch him.
3699260 3702140 Automatic weapons!<br />Lock and load! Let's go!
3730210 3731710 Fire! Fire!
3746050 3747720 Ed.
3748520 3749960 Hey!
3776540 3777870 Sarah!
3779460 3780820 Reese!
3784790 3786180 This way.
3826750 3829160 <i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>
3829190 3832450 <i>In the top story of the hour, the<br />largest single law enforcement</i>

3843340 3844900 Take this.
3847740 3850040 All right, let's get<br />this off the road.
3881490 3884640 - You cold?<br />- Freezing.
3898420 3899940 Reese...
3901080 3903140 You got a first name?
3903510 3904630 Kyle.
3904900 3909370 Kyle... what's it like<br />when you go through time?
3912370 3914040 White light.
3916680 3918240 Pain.
3921280 3925200 - It's like being born maybe.<br />- Oh, my God.
3926270 3928300 I caught one back there.
3929870 3933010 - You mean you got shot?<br />- It's not bad.
3933580 3936980 - We got to get you to a doctor.<br />- It's OK. Forget it.
3937150 3939980 What do you mean,<br />forget it? Are you crazy?
3940750 3942470 Take this off.
3954210 3955700 Jesus.
3956160 3958300 See, it passed right<br />through the meat.
3958770 3963550 Oh, this is going to make me puke.<br />Would you just talk about something?
3963620 3964710 What?
3964740 3968760 I don't know. Anything.<br />Just talk. Tell me about my son.
3969960 3971610 He's about my height.
3975270 3977370 He has your eyes.
3980610 3982610 What's he like?
3982870 3987010 You trust him. He's got a strength.
3988180 3990700 I'd die for John Connor.
3993100 3997100 Well... at least now I know<br />what to name him.
3997470 3999860 I don't suppose you<br />know who the father is,
3999890 4002790 so I won't tell him to get<br />lost when I meet him.
4002830 4005260 John never said much about him.
4005730 4008400 - I know he dies before the war...<br />- Wait!
4010240 4012100 I don't want to know.
4013070 4016270 So, was it John that sent you here?
4016640 4018310 I volunteered.
4019540 4020680 Why?
4020950 4026220 It was a chance to meet the<br />legend... Sarah Connor.
4026890 4031270 Taught her son to fight, organize,
4031340 4033660 prepare from when he was a kid.
4033730 4036180 When you were in hiding<br />before the war...
4039780 4043250 You're talking about things I<br />haven't done yet in the past tense.
4043320 4045950 - It's driving me crazy.<br />- Aah!
4049190 4051530 Are you sure you have<br />the right person?
4051890 4053560 I'm sure.
4054230 4057670 Come on. Do I look like<br />the mother of the future?
4059740 4064640 I mean, am I tough? Organized?<br />I can't even balance my checkbook.
4067680 4073030 Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this<br />honor, and I don't want it! Any of it!
4076640 4080990 Your son gave me a message to<br />give to you. Made me memorize it.
4081960 4085040 "Thank you, Sarah, for your<br />courage through the dark years.
4085110 4089780 I can't help you with what you must soon face<br />except to say that the future is not set.
4089780 4092430 You must be stronger than<br />you imagine you can be.
4092470 4097370 You must survive, or I will<br />never exist". That's all.
4100580 4102760 It's a good field dressing.
4103680 4107720 You like it? It's my first.
4111490 4114520 Get some sleep.<br />It will be light soon.
4118230 4119690 OK.
4130220 4132320 Talk to me some more.
4135330 4136960 About what?
4138130 4140730 Tell me about where you're from.
4142930 4144500 All right.
4146040 4150710 You stay down by day, but at<br />night you can move around.
4150780 4154950 You still have to be careful<br />because the HKs use infrared.
4156620 4162500 But they're not too bright. John<br />taught us ways to dust them.
4163170 4165910 That's when the infiltrators<br />started to appear.
4165970 4169510 The Terminators were the<br />newest... The worst.
4179170 4181200 <i>Traversing your sector<br />in search mode.</i>
4181210 4184440 <i>750 meters north of your position.</i>
4184580 4187640 <i>Understood. 750 meters north.</i>
4189210 4190780 Let's go.
4190950 4192760 <i>Intercept. Over.</i>
4194830 4197370 <i>There are scavenger teams<br />in that quadrant.</i>

4229370 4233170 Firebase, what's your status? Over.
4235810 4239600 - Reese. DN384...<br />- Right. Let him in.
4243200 4246150 <i>Any infiltrators at<br />the shopping mall?</i>
4246220 4252060 <i>No problem. They were clean. We're<br />cutting short the patrol. Over.</i>
4252430 4256410 <i>Roger, Yankee-1-7.<br />You are clear to return.</i>
4331020 4332970 Terminator! Terminator!
4410120 4412550 I was dreaming about dogs.
4413690 4416090 We use them to spot Terminators.
4417360 4420030 Your world is pretty terrifying.
4458480 4462470 Hey, buddy, you got a dead<br />cat in there, or what?
4470080 4472400 Fuck you, asshole.
4491010 4492920 Goddamn!
4493680 4495450 Thank you.
4499490 4502020 Uh, is this enough?
4502690 4506000 Yeah, it's enough. I don't<br />want to ask where you got it.
4512070 4513900 - I'm coming.<br />- We need a room.
4513900 4515840 - All right.<br />- With a kitchen.
4516370 4518170 Do you have one with a kitchen?
4530240 4531970 Mmm.
4533640 4536180 I am dying for a shower.
4537980 4540200 We should check your bandage, too.
4540860 4543600 Later. I'm going out for supplies.
4548190 4549870 Keep this.
4575450 4578990 No, I can't tell you where I am,<br />mom. I was told not to say.
4578990 4581190 <i>Oh, but, honey, I need to<br />know where I can reach you.</i>
4581210 4584630 <i>You tell me to hide out up here at<br />the cabin like some fugitive and...</i>
4584630 4588940 <i>and you won't tell me what's<br />going on? I am worried sick, dear.</i>
4589530 4591360 OK.
4592530 4595470 - OK, here's the number. Ready?<br />- Yes. Go ahead.
4595640 4599180 <i>It's 408-555...</i>
4599200 4601400 <i>- 1439.</i><br />- Uh-huh.
4601440 4603720 <i>- Room 9. Got it?</i><br />- Uh-huh.
4603850 4605680 - I've got it.<br /><i>- I've got to go.</i>
4605840 4610420 <i>I'm sorry I can't tell you more<br />right now. I love you, mom.</i>
4614150 4616750 I love you, too, sweetheart.
4628980 4632190 <i>- Tiki motel.</i><br />- Give me your address there.
4634970 4636540 What have we got?
4639980 4641700 Mothballs.
4642720 4644440 Corn syrup.
4644580 4647820 Ammonia. What's for dinner?
4648590 4651620 - Plastique.<br />- Mmm, that sounds good.
4651790 4653220 What is it?
4653990 4657660 Nitroglycerin, basically.<br />It's a bit more stable.
4657730 4659900 I learned to make it<br />when I was a kid.
4671360 4673880 Make sure there's<br />none on the threads.
4675750 4677420 Like this.
4679250 4681290 Screw the end cap on.
4682950 4685060 Very gently.
4687230 4690260 You must've had a fun childhood.
4693230 4694930 That's good.
4695200 4699740 All right. Six more like that, and<br />I'll get started on the fuses.
4710280 4712480 He'll find us, won't he?
4715120 4716790 Probably.
4734500 4736860 It'll never be over, will it?
4745170 4747600 Look at me. I'm shaking.
4748370 4753790 Some legend, huh? You must<br />be pretty disappointed.
4754560 4758360 No. I'm not.
4767370 4768940 Kyle...
4769880 4774510 The women in your time...<br />what are they like?
4776720 4778650 Good fighters.
4779020 4781120 That's not what I meant.
4783320 4785420 Was there someone special?
4786920 4792030 - Someone?<br />- A girl. You know.
4793130 4794700 No.
4797350 4798920 Never.
4800560 4802120 Never?
4807060 4810530 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
4813300 4815620 So much pain.
4816720 4821430 Pain can be controlled.<br />You just disconnect it.
4821490 4823640 So you feel nothing?
4828730 4831800 John Connor gave me a<br />picture of you once.
4833540 4838580 I didn't know why at the<br />time. It was very old...
4839480 4843010 Torn... faded.
4846350 4852560 You were young like you are now.<br />You seemed just... a little sad.
4853960 4857710 I used to always wonder what you<br />were thinking at that moment.
4858180 4860670 I memorized every line,
4862000 4864130 every curve.
4867370 4870220 I came across time for you, Sarah.
4871260 4875780 I love you. I always have.
4893500 4895300 I shouldn't have said that.
4986240 4988410 Think fast!
5077510 5079220 Trade places!
5089940 5093400 Faster! Drive faster!
5142950 5144480 Kyle!
5145150 5146780 Oh, my God!
5180500 5182140 Kyle.
5196430 5198380 - Whoa!<br />- Son of a bitch!
5213820 5215590 You stay here.
5239030 5240960 Let's get out of here.
5244000 5245730 Get out.
5262280 5265540 Kyle. Come on, get up.
5271680 5273590 He's coming.
5273610 5276480 Kyle? Come on!
5277580 5281040 Help me! Get out! Get out!
5281360 5282930 Get out!
5292200 5293780 Come on!
5299840 5301690 Faster!
5305090 5307580 Don't stop! Run!
5439240 5441180 Sarah!
5441640 5443300 Kyle!
5448250 5451720 Oh, Kyle. Kyle.
5452960 5456140 We did it, Kyle. We got it.
5475750 5477300 No!
5477360 5479300 No!
5534490 5536290 Wait!
5540660 5546060 - What are you doing?<br />- Cover, so he can't track us.
5555990 5560830 Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!
5561970 5565920 - Come on! Come on!<br />- Leave me here.
5565920 5567520 Get up!
5576730 5581700 Move it, Reese!<br />On your feet, soldier!
5581770 5585320 On your feet! Move it!
5656880 5658980 Back. Go back.
5693060 5695330 - Run, Sarah.<br />- No.
5695400 5696930 Run!
5700400 5701970 Run!
5702240 5704320 Come on, motherfucker.
5817240 5819520 No, no.
5937560 5939820 You're terminated, fucker.
5997410 5998980 Kyle.

6019920 6023760 Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?
6024730 6029030 What's most difficult for me is trying to<br />decide what to tell you and what not to.
6029300 6033650 But I guess I have a while yet before you're<br />old enough to even understand these tapes.
6033720 6037860 They're more for me at this point,<br />just so that I can get it straight.
6068300 6071740 <i>- Gasolina, por favor.<br />- ¿Cuánto?</i>
6072210 6076310 <i>- Llena el tanque.</i><br />- Fill her up, <i>sí.</i>
6079950 6085120 Should I tell you about your<br />father? Boy, that's a tough one.
6086420 6091260 Will it affect your decision to send him<br />here, knowing that he is your father?
6093030 6095730 If you don't send Kyle,<br />you can never be.
6095730 6099600 God, a person could go<br />crazy thinking about this.
6102870 6108440 I suppose I will tell you.<br />I owe him that.
6110750 6113280 Maybe it'll help if...
6113350 6118290 You know that in the few<br />hours that we had together...
6120360 6122920 We loved a lifetime's worth.
6126560 6129880 <i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora,<br />y tengo pena decirle</i>
6129880 6135250 <i>que me de cinco dolares americanos,<br />pero si no, mi padre me va a pegar.</i>
6135790 6139720 - What did he just say?<br />- He says you're very beautiful, señora...
6139790 6143160 and he's ashamed to ask you for five<br />American dollars for his picture,
6143160 6146030 but if he doesn't, his<br />father will beat him.
6146200 6148230 Pretty good hustle, kid.
6149200 6151970 <i>- Cuatro<br />- Sí, sí.</i>
6152940 6154340 <i>Gracias.</i>
6155840 6157840 <i>¡Miren, miren!</i>
6159790 6162980 <i>¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!</i>
6165220 6167180 What did he just say?
6167650 6170300 He said there's a storm coming in.
6174240 6175910 I know.
