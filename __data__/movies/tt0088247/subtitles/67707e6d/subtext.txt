303715 305833 Hey, my turn!
308237 309804 Me.
312408 313876 Come on.
314144 317014 Hey, what's wrong with this picture?
325805 328123 Nice night for a walk, eh?
332762 334896 Nice night for a walk.
334964 339451 Washday tomorrow. Nothing clean, right?
339519 341320 Nothing clean. Right.
341388 344439 I think this guy's a couple<br />cans short of a six-pack.
344607 345917 Your clothes.
346843 348736 Give them to me. Now.
349478 351197 Fuck you, asshole!
381744 384179 Hey, sugar, how about it?
384747 389385 I don't have to put up<br />with that bullshit, man.
389453 391854 She's always after me.
392422 394056 I don't... I don't...
454416 458721 Hey, buddy. Did you just<br />see a real bright light?
461073 462440 See that guy?
462508 464726 - Hold it right there!<br />- He's rabbiting.
464794 467763 - Hey! I said hold it!<br />- Go!
468630 471800 That son of a bitch took my pants!
515377 519614 - What day is it? The date!<br />- 12th... May. Thursday.
519682 522017 - What year?!<br />- What?
534447 536865 He's got my gun! Let's go!
621950 625403 <i>3831, they lost the suspect.</i>
711406 713659 Guard it for me, big buns.
716295 719231 - Hi.<br />- Hi. I'm late.
720199 721517 So am I.
765293 767378 - I'm in it.<br />- So am I.
773017 774803 Honey, could I have<br />that coffee now, please?
774810 775944 Yes, sir.
776970 779673 - Okay, who gets the burly beef?<br />- Uh, I ordered barbecued beef.
779676 781976 - I think that's mine, but I didn't order fries.<br />- He gets the barbecued beef.
782044 784762 - Mine's the chili beef deluxe.<br />- Okay, who gets the burly beef?
784830 787415 - Miss, we're ready to order now.<br />- Yes, ma'am.
787583 788516 Aah!
789384 792822 Oh, I'm so sorry. Oh, lord.
794890 796942 This isn't real leather, is it?
798010 799293 This special sucks.
799360 802832 Nice going, kid. Ought<br />to give you the tip.
805434 808771 Look at it this way... in a hundred<br />years, who's going to care?
816745 818713 The twelve-gauge auto-loader.
821116 824887 That's Italian. You<br />can go pump or auto.
825754 828607 The .45 long slide,<br />with laser sighting.
828675 832160 These are brand-new. We just<br />got them in. That's a good gun.
832728 835397 Just touch the trigger, the beam<br />comes on, and you put the red dot
835398 838216 where you want the bullet<br />to go. You can't miss.
840219 841569 Anything else?
841637 844072 A phased plasma rifle<br />in the 40-watt range.
844240 846174 Just what you see, pal.
847326 849193 The Uzi 9mm.
850262 854832 You know your weapons, buddy. Any one<br />of these is ideal for home defense.
855600 858886 So, uh... which will it be?
859054 860104 All.
860472 862673 I may close early today.
862842 867278 There's a 15-day wait on the handguns,<br />but the rifles you can take right now.
867846 869364 You can't do that.
869830 871049 Wrong.
897259 900227 Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.
900295 903966 Listen, I need you to come pick<br />me up. My bike just broke down.
904533 907435 I don't care what you're doing.<br />Come and get me. What the...
908403 912657 Hey, man, you got a<br />serious attitude problem.
965594 968463 - Sarah Connor?<br />- Yes?
980809 983277 I'm on my break, Chuck.<br />Carla's got my station.
983278 986647 Sarah, come here!<br />It's about you. I mean, sort of.
989468 991528 It's so incredible. You're<br />not gonna believe this.
991554 993612 Sit down. You are<br />going to love this.
993655 995456 - Shh!<br />- What?
995457 998023 <i>Has been compiled<br />from several witnesses.</i>

1303715 1307300 You fuckin' pigs! Wait till<br />I get my hands on you!
1307368 1309703 - Get off of me!<br />- Sit down, fella.
1310470 1311704 Ed.
1313940 1316043 - What do you got?<br />- Dead girl.
1316110 1319813 - I can see that.<br />- Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35,
1319880 1323817 shot six times at less than ten<br />feet. Large caliber weapon.
1323885 1325451 You know, these work.
1327020 1328554 What's this?
1328622 1332158 Dead girl 2, sent over from<br />Valley Division this afternoon.
1334295 1338749 - I'm sure there's a point to all of this.<br />- Look at the name, Ed.
1339517 1343670 Sarah Louise... Connor.<br />Is this right?
1345006 1346406 You're kidding me.
1346474 1349176 The press is going to be<br />short-stroking it all over the place.
1349244 1351066 A one-day pattern killer.
1352292 1353455 I hate the weird ones.
1358152 1359619 So...
1361455 1363423 Better than mortal man deserves.
1370998 1375168 - Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?<br />- No, not lately. Did you check messages?
1375335 1377003 Uh-uh. I thought you did.
1381409 1383377 <i>Hi, Sarah, this is your mom...</i>
1383444 1385867 There you are, young man.
1385893 1390425 - You mind your mother.<br /><i>- So call me back, will you, dear? Uh, bye.</i>
1392203 1395472 <i>Hi, Sarah. Dan Moorski.<br />Uh, something's come up,</i>
1395473 1397974 <i>and it looks like I won't<br />be able to make it tonight.</i>
1398040 1401511 <i>Just can't get out of it. Look, I'm<br />really sorry. I'll make it up to you.</i>
1401579 1404514 <i>Call you in a day or so,<br />okay? Sorry. Bye.</i>
1405982 1409385 That bum. So what if<br />he has a Porsche?
1409453 1412857 He can't treat you like this. It's<br />Friday night, for Christ's sake!
1414325 1415992 I'll live.
1416360 1418561 I'll break his kneecaps.
1419330 1423299 Well... Pugsley still loves<br />me, don't you, baby?
1424435 1427103 God. It's disgusting.
1428870 1430723 - I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.<br />- Okay.
1430790 1433926 - You and Matt have a good time.<br />- We will. You, too.
1433994 1435012 Okay.
1439100 1440900 Damn it, Matt!
1497540 1499074 Oh, shit.
1499142 1501942 Lieutenant, are you aware<br />that these two killings
1501944 1504246 occurred in the same order as<br />their listings in the phone book?
1504314 1506548 Now, what can I tell you<br />guys? No comment.
1506616 1508417 But, lieutenant, we've<br />got two murders...
1519562 1522931 - That coffee's two hours cold.<br />- Mm-hmm.
1522998 1524867 I put a cigarette out in it.
1526135 1529471 - Did you reach the next girl yet?<br />- No. I keep getting an answering machine.
1529539 1530913 - Send a unit.<br />- I sent a unit.
1530939 1533442 There's no answer at the door, and<br />the apartment manager's not home.
1533509 1534318 Call her.
1534344 1536527 - I just called her.<br />- Call her again.
1537153 1538639 Give me a cigarette.
1549542 1550909 <i>Hi there.</i>
1551577 1556381 <i>Ha ha ha. Fooled you. You're talking to<br />a machine, but don't be shy, it's okay.</i>
1564473 1565707 Same shit.
1567376 1571379 I can hear it now. He's gonna be called<br />the goddamn "Phone Book killer."
1571447 1576617 I hate these press cases,<br />especially the weird press cases.
1578054 1580739 - Where you going?<br />- To make a statement.
1580906 1583274 Maybe make these jackals<br />work for us for a change.
1583343 1587529 If I can get on the tube by eleven<br />o'clock, maybe she'll call us.
1587897 1589131 Well...
1589599 1592317 - How do I look?<br />- Like shit, boss.
1592585 1593785 Your mama.
1594088 1595155 Lieutenant!
1595188 1598340 <i>This just in. Police have<br />announced the name of the victim</i>
1598407 1602327 <i>in the second of two execution-style<br />murders which took place today.</i>
1602394 1606798 <i>Incredibly, the names of the two<br />victims are virtually identical.</i>

1610970 1613038 <i>- in her Santa Monica apartment...</i><br />- Can we change this?

1614624 1618076 - Don't touch it!<br /><i>- unknown gunman earlier today in her home.</i>
1618144 1620895 <i>Now, police are refusing to speculate<br />on the apparent similarity</i>
1620896 1624632 <i>between these shooting deaths, and no<br />other connection between the two victims</i>
1624633 1626834 <i>has been established as of yet.</i>
1626836 1630539 <i>Of course, we'll have more on this<br />late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>

1853212 1854646 Whoa!
1856915 1858883 Don't make me bust you up, man!
1919428 1921596 <i>Hi there. Ha ha ha. Fooled you.</i>

1935827 1940995 <i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard<br />called Technoir. I'm really scared.</i>
1941020 1943646 I think that there's<br />somebody's after me.

1946670 1949991 <i>I need you and Matt to come and<br />pick me up as soon as possible.</i>
1950058 1953877 The police keep transferring me around.<br />I'm gonna give them another try.

1958110 1960009 <i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>
1977652 1979019 It's her.
1980020 1984140 - Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.<br />- <i>Look, Lieutenant,</i> don't put me on hold
1984140 1987244 - and don't transfer me to another department!<br />- Don't worry. I won't. Now, just relax.
1987270 1990317 - Can you tell me where you are?<br /><i>- I'm in this bar called Technoir.</i>
1990343 1993071 Yeah, I know. It's on Pico.<br />Are you all right?
1993097 1996475 Yeah, but I don't want to leave.<br />I think there's a guy following me.
1996500 1998985 All right, now, listen, Miss<br />Connor, now, listen carefully,
1999010 2001567 you're in a public place, so<br />you'll be safe till we get there,
2001568 2004408 but stay visible. Don't go outside<br />or even to the rest room.
2004413 2006814 <i>- I'll have a car there in a hot minute.</i><br />- Okay.
2031239 2033573 Hey, that guy didn't pay.
2192967 2194852 Come with me if you want to live.
2204260 2206012 Come on!
2278202 2280887 This is 1-L19. I got a<br />hit-and-run felony.
2280955 2285375 Suspect vehicle... late model gray<br />Ford, headed westbound on 7th.
2285443 2287811 He's really moving, punching<br />lights all the way.
2287879 2292199 I'm going to need an ambulance<br />at 7th and Broadway right now.
2293168 2294368 Hold it!

2324212 2327499 Are you injured? Are you shot?
2329953 2331302 No!
2333339 2336307 Do exactly what I say. Exactly.
2336775 2340646 Don't move unless I say. Don't<br />make a sound unless I say.
2340713 2342348 Do you understand?
2342915 2346568 - Do you understand?!<br />- Yes! Yes! Please, don't hurt me.
2364769 2368540 I'm here to help you. I'm<br />Reese, Sergeant Techcom,
2368542 2373428 DN38416, assigned to protect you.<br />You've been targeted for termination.
2378752 2382154 <i>Attempt to intercept, 1-L19.</i>
2383222 2387892 This is 1-L19. Westbound on<br />Olympic approaching Overland.
2392398 2395678 This is a mistake.<br />I didn't do anything.
2395704 2399357 No, but you will. It's very<br />important that you live.
2399683 2403427 This isn't true. How could that<br />man just get up after you...
2403428 2405898 He's not a man. A machine.
2406149 2410349 A Terminator. A Cyberdine<br />systems model 101.
2418274 2419645 A machine?
2420770 2425196 - Like a robot?<br />- Not a robot. A cyborg.
2425464 2427043 A cybernetic organism.
2427069 2430002 - No. He was bleeding.<br />- Just a second.
2433172 2434522 Get your head down!
2479234 2482703 All right, listen. The Terminator's<br />an infiltration unit...
2482770 2487374 part man, part machine. Underneath,<br />it's a hyperalloy combat chassis...
2487442 2491195 microprocessor controlled,<br />fully armored, very tough.
2491196 2493630 But outside, it's<br />living human tissue.
2493966 2498119 Flesh, skin, hair, blood...<br />grown for the cyborgs.
2498187 2499687 Look, Reese, I don't know<br />what you want from...
2499755 2502924 Pay attention! I got<br />to ditch this car.
2508198 2512150 The 600 series had rubber<br />skin. We spotted them easy.
2512218 2514786 But these are new.<br />They look human...
2514854 2518873 Sweat, bad breath, everything.<br />Very hard to spot.
2519040 2521843 I had to wait till he moved on<br />you before I could zero him.
2522410 2528508 Look... I am not stupid, you know.<br />They cannot make things like that yet.
2528534 2532595 Not yet. Not for about forty years.
2534873 2539443 - Are you saying it's from the future?<br />- One possible future.
2539910 2543031 From your point of view...<br />I don't know tech stuff.
2544366 2547168 Then you're from the future,<br />too, is that right?
2547236 2549421 - Right.<br />- Right.
2557296 2560848 Cyborgs don't feel pain. I do.
2561116 2562600 Don't do that again.
2562667 2565103 - Just let me go.<br />- Listen!
2565270 2569758 And understand. That<br />Terminator is out there.
2570660 2575030 It can't be bargained with.<br />It can't be reasoned with.
2575097 2579334 It doesn't feel pity<br />or remorse or fear.
2579402 2583071 And it absolutely<br />will not stop. Ever!
2583438 2585923 Until you are dead.
2595350 2597252 Can you stop it?
2601340 2602940 I don't know.
2604643 2607528 With these weapons, I don't know.
2623662 2626582 <i>All units. All units. Gray Ford<br />suspect vehicle's been found</i>
2626583 2629250 <i>in a parking structure<br />at 4th and Beaudry.</i>
2671342 2672576 Reese.
2673662 2675630 Why me?
2677666 2679684 Why does it want me?
2686158 2688259 There was a nuclear war...
2690062 2692263 A few years from now.
2694800 2696334 All this...
2696702 2699905 This whole place. Everything.
2700573 2702139 It's gone.
2703809 2705477 Just gone.
2705844 2707746 There were survivors.
2707914 2710365 Here. There.
2712768 2714970 Nobody even knew who started it.
2717773 2720040 It was the machines, Sarah.
2721309 2725446 - I don't understand.<br />- Defense network computers.
2726280 2729851 New... powerful...
2730418 2734856 Hooked into everything.<br />Trusted to run it all.
2735224 2740477 They say it got smart...<br />a new order of intelligence.
2741245 2745701 Then it saw <i>all</i> people as a threat,<br />not just the ones on the other side.
2746768 2749671 Decided our fate in<br />a microsecond...
2751239 2753007 extermination.
2767287 2769522 Did you see this war?
2781268 2784687 No. I grew up after it...
2784755 2787991 In the ruins. Starving...
2788058 2790410 - Hiding from HKs.<br />- HKs?
2790478 2795531 Hunter-killers. Patrol machines<br />built in automated factories.
2796199 2801022 Most of us were rounded up, put<br />in camps for orderly disposal.
2802690 2805541 This was burned in<br />by laser scanner.
2809330 2813751 Some of us were<br />kept alive... to work...
2814618 2820072 Loading bodies. The disposal<br />units ran night and day.
2820140 2823510 We were that close<br />to going out forever.
2825978 2829849 But there was one man<br />who taught us to fight,
2829917 2835722 to storm the wire of the camps, to smash<br />those metal motherfuckers into junk.
2836690 2839893 He turned it around. He brought<br />us back from the brink.
2839900 2844104 His name was Connor. John Connor.
2844630 2846232 Your son, Sarah.
2847268 2849302 Your unborn son.
2958946 2960363 Drive!
2967188 2970255 Reese!
2988042 2991543 No, Reese! No! No!<br />No! They'll kill you.
2991610 2994964 You in the Cadillac!<br />Let me see your hands now!
2997500 2999068 Get out of the car!
3002739 3004608 Drop to your knees!
3004975 3007743 - Out of the car.<br />- Drop to the ground.
3036373 3038073 Sarah...
3038340 3040744 Sarah, try to drink some of this.
3043412 3048434 Listen, are you sure it's them? Maybe...<br />maybe I should look at the bodies.
3048602 3051337 No. They've been identified,<br />and there's no doubt.
3051405 3053572 Oh, God.
3053574 3055241 God!
3055308 3057410 Ginger!
3060647 3062081 Sarah.
3062916 3065752 - Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.<br />- Hi, Sarah.
3065820 3068805 I want you to tell him<br />everything that Reese told you.
3068873 3072442 - Do you feel up to that?<br />- Yeah. I guess so.
3074077 3075745 You're a doctor?
3076213 3079866 - Criminal psychologist.<br />- Is Reese crazy?
3079933 3082363 Well, that's what<br />we're gonna find out.
3167554 3171256 So, you're a soldier,<br />fighting for whom?
3172692 3178130 With the 132nd, under<br />Perry. From '21 to '27.
3178297 3183051 - That's the year 2027?<br />- That's right. And I was assigned...
3183119 3184720 This is fucking great.
3184787 3187108 The last two years<br />under John Connor.
3187134 3190442 - Who was the enemy again?<br />- A computer defense system built for...
3190443 3192961 Oh, damn. Sorry.
3192996 3196331 Built for SAC-NORAD<br />by Cyberdine systems.
3196399 3197833 I see.
3198400 3204373 And this, uh, computer thinks it can win<br />by killing the mother of its enemy,
3204540 3208093 killing him, in effect,<br />before he's even conceived,
3208160 3210462 a sort of retroactive abortion?
3211829 3213264 That guy Silberman cracks me up.
3213332 3216091 Last week, he had this guy in here that<br />burned his Afghan. He screwed it first,
3216117 3218070 - then he set it on fire.<br />- Hey, shut up.
3218138 3220255 Why didn't the computer<br />just kill Connor then?
3220323 3223225 Why this elaborate scheme<br />with the Terminator?
3223292 3227546 It had no choice. Their<br />defense grid was smashed.
3227613 3231767 We'd won. Taking out Connor<br />then would make no difference.
3232035 3235120 Skynet had to wipe out<br />his entire existence.
3235188 3239074 Is that when you captured the lab complex<br />and found that... uh, what is it called?
3239142 3242244 Uh... the time<br />displacement equipment?
3242512 3246615 That's right. The Terminator<br />had already gone through.
3246782 3250085 Connor sent me to intercept,<br />and they blew the whole place.
3250252 3252270 How are you supposed get back?
3252396 3253964 I can't.
3255642 3257643 Nobody goes home.
3259145 3265184 Nobody else comes through.<br />It's just him and me.
3369972 3372790 It's just him and me.
3375377 3380314 Why didn't you bring any weapons,<br />something more advanced?
3380382 3383318 Don't you have ray guns?
3384086 3385152 Ray guns.
3385220 3387755 Show me a piece of<br />future technology.
3387823 3392065 You go naked. Something about the<br />field generated by a living organism.
3392127 3394295 - Nothing dead will go.<br />- Why?
3394363 3398633 - I didn't build the fucking thing!<br />- Okay, okay. But this...
3398700 3402237 - Cyborg, if it's metal...<br />- Surrounded by living tissue!
3402305 3403488 Oh. Right, right...
3404356 3407291 This is great stuff. I could<br />make a career out of this guy.
3407358 3410226 You see how clever this part is? How<br />it doesn't require a shred of proof?
3410227 3414298 And most paranoid delusions are<br />intricate, but this is brilliant.
3415600 3417984 Why were the other<br />two women killed?
3418010 3420179 Most of the records<br />were lost in the war.
3420222 3425087 Skynet knew almost nothing about Connor's<br />mother. Her full name, where she lived.
3425113 3428754 They just knew the city. The<br />Terminator was just being systematic.
3428798 3432593 - Uh-huh. Well, let's go back to...<br />- Look, you have heard enough!
3432719 3436153 I have answered your questions!<br />Now I have to see Sarah Connor!
3436155 3439607 - I'm afraid that's not up to me.<br />- Then why am I talking to you?
3439675 3441676 - Because I can help you.<br />- Who is in authority here?
3441702 3443511 - Reese...<br />- Shut up!
3444079 3446647 You still don't get it, do you?
3446815 3450250 He'll find her.<br />That's what he does!
3450318 3454055 That's all he does!<br />You can't stop him!
3454058 3458294 He'll wade through you, reach down her<br />throat, and pull her fucking heart out!
3458326 3461078 - Doc.<br />- Let... let go of me!
3464732 3466100 Sorry.
3471005 3474658 - So, Reese is crazy?<br />- In technical terminology...
3474826 3476393 He's a loon.
3476760 3480165 Sarah, this is what<br />they call body armor.
3480532 3484635 Our TAC guys wear these. It'll<br />stop a twelve-gauge round.
3484703 3489381 This other individual must have been wearing<br />one under his coat. Feel that. Go ahead.
3491042 3493076 What about when he punched<br />through the windshield?
3493144 3495763 He was probably on PCP.<br />Broke every bone in his hand
3495830 3498661 and wouldn't feel it for hours.<br />There was this guy once...
3498687 3500201 - You see this scar?<br />- Here.
3500269 3501736 Thank you.
3502104 3506224 There's a couch in this other room. Why don't<br />you stretch out and try to get some sleep?
3506290 3508772 It'll be at least an hour before your<br />mother gets here from Big Bear.
3508828 3511763 - I can't sleep.<br />- Try.
3511930 3516083 Well, it may not look it, but<br />that couch is very comfortable.
3517452 3522257 You'll be perfectly safe. We got<br />thirty cops in this building.
3523125 3524491 Thank you.
3530098 3532499 - Good night.<br />- Good night.
3546814 3548823 I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.
3548849 3551008 I was told that she's here.<br />Could I see her, please?
3551034 3553688 No. You can't see her.<br />She's making a statement.
3553714 3556472 - Where is she?<br />- Look, it may take a while...
3556498 3558802 if you want to wait, there's<br />a bench over there.
3569704 3571656 I'll be back.
3598483 3600485 What the hell was that?
3609810 3611095 Gunshot!
3619872 3622775 - What is it, terrorists?<br />- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!
3627028 3628930 Stay here.
3642594 3643650 Let's get out of here!
3643676 3646657 - Come on! Come on!<br />- He's got an automatic weapon!
3649200 3651285 Move it, move it, move it, move it!
3661914 3663964 What the hell happened<br />to the lights?
3668570 3670037 Watch him.
3690509 3693394 Automatic weapons!<br />Lock and load! Let's go!
3721455 3722955 Fire! Fire!
3737304 3738972 Ed.
3739774 3741208 Hey!
3767785 3769119 Sarah!
3770705 3772072 Reese!
3776044 3777428 This way.
3818000 3820411 <i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>

3834585 3836152 Take this.
3838989 3841291 All right, let's get<br />this off the road.
3872740 3875892 - You cold?<br />- Freezing.
3889673 3891191 Reese...
3892326 3894394 You got a first name?
3894762 3895878 Kyle.
3896146 3900617 Kyle... what's it like<br />when you go through time?
3903620 3905288 White light.
3907925 3909493 Pain.
3912529 3916449 - It's like being born maybe.<br />- Oh, my God.
3917517 3919553 I caught one back there.
3921120 3924257 - You mean you got shot?<br />- It's not bad.
3924825 3928228 - We got to get you to a doctor.<br />- It's okay. Forget it.
3928396 3931231 What do you mean,<br />forget it? Are you crazy?
3931999 3933717 Take this off.
3945463 3946945 Jesus.
3947413 3949548 See, it passed right<br />through the meat.
3950016 3954804 Oh, this is going to make me puke.<br />Would you just talk about something?
3954872 3955959 What?
3955985 3960009 I don't know. Anything.<br />Just talk. Tell me about my son.
3961210 3962862 He's about my height.
3966516 3968618 He has your eyes.
3971856 3973857 What's he like?
3974124 3978262 You trust him. He's got a strength.
3979430 3981948 I'd die for John Connor.
3984350 3988354 Well... at least now I know<br />what to name him.
3988722 3991113 I don't suppose you<br />know who the father is,
3991139 3994035 so I won't tell him to get<br />lost when I meet him.
3994078 3996512 John never said much about him.
3996980 3999649 - I know he dies before the war...<br />- Wait!
4001485 4003353 I don't want to know.
4004320 4007523 So, was it John that sent you here?
4007890 4009559 I volunteered.
4010794 4011927 Why?
4012195 4017467 It was a chance to meet the<br />legend... Sarah Connor.
4018135 4022522 Taught her son to fight, organize,
4022590 4024908 prepare from when he was a kid.
4024976 4027427 When you were in hiding<br />before the war...
4031030 4034500 You're talking about things I<br />haven't done yet in the past tense.
4034568 4037203 - It's driving me crazy.<br />- Aah!
4040440 4042776 Are you sure you have<br />the right person?
4043144 4044811 I'm sure.
4045479 4048917 Come on. Do I look like<br />the mother of the future?
4050985 4055889 I mean, am I tough? Organized?<br />I can't even balance my checkbook.
4058926 4064281 Look, Reese, I didn't ask for this<br />honor, and I don't want it! Any of it!
4067886 4072238 Your son gave me a message to<br />give to you. Made me memorize it.
4073206 4076293 "Thank you, Sarah, for your<br />courage through the dark years.
4076360 4081031 I can't help you with what you must soon face<br />except to say that the future is not set.
4081032 4083684 You must be stronger than<br />you imagine you can be.
4083718 4088623 You must survive, or I will<br />never exist". That's all.
4091825 4094010 It's a good field dressing.
4094929 4098966 You like it? It's my first.
4102736 4105771 Get some sleep.<br />It will be light soon.
4109476 4110943 Okay.
4121470 4123572 Talk to me some more.
4126576 4128212 About what?
4129379 4131980 Tell me about where you're from.
4134184 4135751 All right.
4137287 4141957 You stay down by day, but at<br />night you can move around.
4142025 4146197 You still have to be careful<br />because the HKs use infrared.
4147865 4153752 But they're not too bright. John<br />taught us ways to dust them.
4154420 4157155 That's when the infiltrators<br />started to appear.
4157223 4160759 The Terminators were the<br />newest... The worst.

4172455 4175690 <i>750 meters north of your position.</i>

4180462 4182030 Let's go.

4227059 4230845 - Reese. DN384...<br />- Right. Let him in.
4234450 4237402 <i>Any infiltrators at<br />the shopping mall?</i>
4237470 4243308 <i>No problem. They were clean. We're<br />cutting short the patrol. Over.</i>
4243676 4247662 <i>Roger, Yankee-1-7.<br />You are clear to return.</i>
4322270 4324222 Terminator! Terminator!
4401366 4403801 I was dreaming about dogs.
4404937 4407339 We use them to spot Terminators.
4408606 4411275 Your world is pretty terrifying.
4449730 4453718 Hey, buddy, you got a dead<br />cat in there, or what?
4461327 4463645 Fuck you, asshole.
4482264 4484165 Goddamn!
4484933 4486701 Thank you.
4490739 4493274 Uh, is this enough?
4493942 4497246 Yeah, it's enough. I don't<br />want to ask where you got it.
4503318 4505153 - I'm coming.<br />- We need a room.
4505154 4507089 - All right.<br />- With a kitchen.
4507622 4509423 Do you have one with a kitchen?
4521486 4523222 Mmm.
4524889 4527425 I am dying for a shower.
4529228 4531446 We should check your bandage, too.
4532113 4534849 Later. I'm going out for supplies.
4539437 4541122 Keep this.
4566699 4570235 No, I can't tell you where I am,<br />mom. I was told not to say.
4570236 4572435 <i>Oh, but, honey, I need to<br />know where I can reach you.</i>
4572460 4575882 <i>You tell me to hide out up here at<br />the cabin like some fugitive and...</i>

4580779 4582614 Okay.
4583782 4586717 - Okay, here's the number. Ready?<br />- Yes. Go ahead.
4586885 4590428 <i>It's 408-555...</i>
4590454 4592646 <i>- 1439.</i><br />- Uh-huh.
4592689 4594972 <i>- Room 9. Got it?</i><br />- Uh-huh.
4595098 4596926 - I've got it.<br /><i>- I've got to go.</i>
4597094 4601665 <i>I'm sorry I can't tell you more<br />right now. I love you, mom.</i>
4605403 4608004 I love you, too, sweetheart.
4620233 4623436 <i>- Tiki motel.</i><br />- Give me your address there.
4626223 4627790 What have we got?
4631228 4632945 Mothballs.
4633970 4635690 Corn syrup.
4635833 4639069 Ammonia. What's for dinner?
4639837 4642872 - Plastique.<br />- Mmm, that sounds good.
4643040 4644474 What is it?
4645242 4648911 Nitroglycerin, basically.<br />It's a bit more stable.
4648979 4651148 I learned to make it<br />when I was a kid.
4662610 4665129 Make sure there's<br />none on the threads.
4666997 4668665 Like this.
4670500 4672536 Screw the end cap on.
4674204 4676305 Very gently.
4678475 4681511 You must've had a fun childhood.
4684480 4686182 That's good.
4686449 4690987 All right. Six more like that, and<br />I'll get started on the fuses.
4701530 4703732 He'll find us, won't he?
4706370 4708037 Probably.
4725754 4728107 It'll never be over, will it?
4736417 4738853 Look at me. I'm shaking.
4739620 4745042 Some legend, huh? You must<br />be pretty disappointed.
4745810 4749612 No. I'm not.
4758622 4760189 Kyle...
4761125 4765761 The women in your time...<br />what are they like?
4767965 4769900 Good fighters.
4770267 4772368 That's not what I meant.
4774570 4776672 Was there someone special?
4778174 4783278 - Someone?<br />- A girl. You know.
4784380 4785948 No.
4788602 4790169 Never.
4791805 4793372 Never?
4798310 4801781 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
4804550 4806869 So much pain.
4807970 4812676 Pain can be controlled.<br />You just disconnect it.
4812743 4814894 So you feel nothing?
4819984 4823052 John Connor gave me a<br />picture of you once.
4824789 4829825 I didn't know why at the<br />time. It was very old...
4830728 4834263 Torn... faded.
4837600 4843807 You were young like you are now.<br />You seemed just... a little sad.
4845209 4848963 I used to always wonder what you<br />were thinking at that moment.
4849430 4851924 I memorized every line,
4853250 4855375 every curve.
4858620 4861474 I came across time for you, Sarah.
4862509 4867030 I love you. I always have.
4884748 4886549 I shouldn't have said that.
4977490 4979658 Think fast!
5068764 5070465 Trade places!
5081193 5084646 Faster! Drive faster!
5134196 5135730 Kyle!
5136397 5138032 Oh, my God!
5171750 5173385 Kyle.
5187683 5189634 - Whoa!<br />- Son of a bitch!
5205067 5206835 You stay here.
5230276 5232210 Let's get out of here.
5235247 5236981 Get out.
5253533 5256785 Kyle. Come on, get up.
5262925 5264838 He's coming.
5264864 5267729 Kyle? Come on!
5268830 5272286 Help me! Get out! Get out!
5272612 5274184 Get out!
5283445 5285029 Come on!
5291086 5292937 Faster!
5296340 5298826 Don't stop! Run!
5430492 5432426 Sarah!
5432894 5434545 Kyle!
5439500 5442970 Oh, Kyle. Kyle.
5444206 5447391 We did it, Kyle. We got it.
5466995 5468546 No!
5468614 5470548 No!
5525737 5527538 Wait!
5531910 5537314 - What are you doing?<br />- Cover, so he can't track us.
5547242 5552079 Come on! Come on. No, Kyle!
5553215 5557168 - Come on! Come on!<br />- Leave me here.
5557169 5558770 Get up!
5567979 5572950 Move it, Reese!<br />On your feet, soldier!
5573017 5576570 On your feet! Move it!
5648126 5650227 Back. Go back.
5684313 5686581 - Run, Sarah.<br />- No.
5686649 5688182 Run!
5691653 5693221 Run!
5693488 5695573 Come on, motherfucker.
5808486 5810770 No, no.
5928805 5931073 You're terminated, fucker.
5988664 5990233 Kyle.

6011170 6015007 Tape 7, November 10. Where was I?
6015975 6020279 What's most difficult for me is trying to<br />decide what to tell you and what not to.
6020547 6024901 But I guess I have a while yet before you're<br />old enough to even understand these tapes.
6024969 6029106 They're more for me at this point,<br />just so that I can get it straight.
6059553 6062989 <i>- Gasolina, por favor.<br />- ¿Cuánto?</i>
6063457 6067560 <i>- Llena el tanque.</i><br />- Fill her up, <i>sí.</i>
6071197 6076369 Should I tell you about your<br />father? Boy, that's a tough one.
6077670 6082509 Will it affect your decision to send him<br />here, knowing that he is your father?
6084277 6086976 If you don't send Kyle,<br />you can never be.
6086980 6090849 God, a person could go<br />crazy thinking about this.
6094120 6099692 I suppose I will tell you.<br />I owe him that.
6101995 6104531 Maybe it'll help if...
6104598 6109536 You know that in the few<br />hours that we had together...
6111605 6114174 We loved a lifetime's worth.
6117810 6121131 <i>Usted es muy hermosa, señora,<br />y tengo pena decirle</i>
6121132 6126502 <i>que me de cinco dolares americanos,<br />pero si no, mi padre me va a pegar.</i>
6127036 6130972 - What did he just say?<br />- He says you're very beautiful, señora...
6131040 6134410 and he's ashamed to ask you for five<br />American dollars for his picture,
6134410 6137280 but if he doesn't, his<br />father will beat him.
6137448 6139482 Pretty good hustle, kid.
6140450 6143219 <i>- Cuatro<br />- Sí, sí.</i>
6144187 6145588 <i>Gracias.</i>
6147090 6149091 <i>¡Miren, miren!</i>
6151044 6154230 <i>¡Allá! ¡Viene una tormenta!</i>
6156465 6158434 What did he just say?
6158902 6161554 He said there's a storm coming in.
6165492 6167159 I know.
