228979 233018 What the hell...?<br />Goddamn son-of-a-bitch...
248039 249029 What the hell...?
303637 305503 Hey, my turn.
314231 317895 Hey, what's wrong with this picture?
325784 327900 Nice night for a walk?
332624 333955 Nice night for a walk.
335043 339287 Wash day tomorrow.<br />Nothing clean, right?
339464 341000 Nothing clean. Right.
341174 344212 I think this guy's a couple of cans<br />short of a six-pack.
344386 349051 Your clothes, give them to me. Now.
349224 350714 Fuck you, asshole.
454454 458448 Hey, buddy, did you just see<br />a real bright light?
461211 462576 <i>See that guy?</i>
462754 463835 Hold it right there.
464005 465837 He's rabbiting.<br />Hey! I said hold it!
466007 467168 Go!
468718 471676 That son-of-a-bitch took my pants.
515557 518549 What day is it? The date.<br />12th May.
518727 520513 Thursday.<br />What year?
534367 536028 He's got my gun. Let's go.
711294 713626 Guard it for me, Big Buns.
717091 719082 Hi. I'm late.
720053 721669 So am I.
764889 767176 I'm in it.<br />So am I.
773022 775889 Honey, can I have that coffee now?<br />Yes, sir.
776985 779443 OK. Who gets the burly-beef?<br />I ordered barbecued.
779612 781649 I think that's mine,<br />but I didn't order fries.
781823 784531 Mine's the chili beef deluxe.<br />OK, who gets the burly-beef?
784701 787534 Miss, we're ready to order now.<br />Yes, ma'am.
789789 791530 I'm so sorry.
794711 796577 This isn't real leather, is it?
799882 803045 Nice going, kid.<br />I ought to give you the tip.
805346 808213 Look at it this way.<br />In 100 years, who's gonna care?
816607 818769 The 12-gauge auto-loader.
820903 824771 That's Italian. You can go pump or auto.
825742 828484 The .45 long slide with laser sighting.
828661 831949 These are new. We just got them in.<br />That's a good gun.
832665 834406 Just touch the trigger,<br />the beam comes on,
834584 836416 and you put the red dot where<br />you want the bullet to go.
836586 838076 You can't miss.
840089 844083 Anything else?<br />Plasma rifle in the 40-watt range.
844260 845876 Hey, just what you see, pal.
847180 848420 The Uzi nine millimeter.
849974 852215 You know your weapons, buddy.
852393 854555 Any one of these<br />is ideal for home defense.
855772 858764 So which will it be?
858941 862434 All.<br />I may close early today.
862612 866947 It's a 15-day wait on the handguns,<br />but the rifles you can take now.
868117 870108 You can't do that.<br />Wrong.
897188 899930 Hi, baby. Yeah, yeah, it's me.
900108 904397 Listen, I need you to come pick me up.<br />My bike just broke down.
904570 906811 I don't care what you're doing.<br />Come and get me. What the...?
908449 912613 Hey, man, you got<br />a serious attitude problem.
965715 968047 Sarah Connor?<br />Yes?
980688 983100 I'm on my break, Chuck.<br />Carla's got my station.
983274 986642 Sarah, come here. It's about you.<br />I mean, sort of.
989197 994442 So incredible. You're not gonna believe<br />this. Sit, you're going to love this.
994619 997737 What?<br /><i>...compiled from several witnesses.</i>
997914 1001077 <i>Once again, Sarah Connor,<br />35, mother of two,</i>
1001250 1003582 <i>brutally shot to death<br />in her home this afternoon.</i>
1003753 1005539 You're dead, honey.
1198948 1200939 <i>...if you're into sound,</i>
1201117 1205452 <i>for the greatest sound around,<br />come to Bob's Stereo at 2500 Sepulveda.</i>
1205621 1209831 <i>We've got woofers, tweeters,<br />the newest in audio and compact discs.</i>
1210000 1212492 <i>We've got graphic equalizers<br />and sound balancers that...</i>
1236861 1238317 sorry-
1250499 1252160 Hello?
1252334 1256373 <i>First I'm gonna rip the buttons<br />off your blouse one by one,</i>
1256547 1260962 <i>then run my tongue down your neck<br />to your bare, gleaming breasts.</i>
1261135 1266847 <i>And then slowly... slowly pull<br />your jeans off inch by inch.</i>
1268225 1269761 Ginger, it's Matt.
1269935 1273849 And lick your belly in circles<br />further and further down,
1274023 1277266 and then pull your panties off<br />with my teeth.
1277443 1278729 Who is this?
1280362 1282319 God. Sarah?
1283866 1286107 <i>Jesus. I'm sorry.</i>
1286285 1289073 I thought you were...<br />Can I talk to Ginger, please?
1289830 1290820 Sure.
1293459 1295041 It's the creep.
1296712 1297702 Hello?
1297880 1301418 First I'll rip the buttons off<br />your blouse one by one...
1303344 1308339 You fucking pigs! Wait till I get<br />my hands on you. Get off me!
1310351 1311591 Ed.
1313896 1315933 What have you got?<br />Dead girl.
1316106 1319599 I can see that.<br />Sarah Ann Connor, secretary, 35.
1319777 1323611 Shot six times at less than ten feet.<br />Large caliber weapon.
1323781 1325567 You know, these work.
1326951 1329613 What's this?<br />Dead girl two.
1329787 1332449 Sent over from the Valley division<br />this afternoon.
1334208 1336700 Are you sure there's<br />a point to all of this?
1336877 1338868 Look at the name, Ed.
1339630 1343214 Sarah Louise Connor. Is this right?
1344927 1346088 You're kidding me.
1346262 1348845 The press is gonna be short-stroking it.
1349014 1353349 A one-day pattern killer.<br />I hate the weird ones.
1357982 1359814 So...
1361277 1363609 Better than mortal man deserves.
1370911 1375246 Ginger, have you seen Pugsley?<br />Not lately. Did you check messages?
1375416 1377248 I thought you did.
1382089 1385878 Hi, Sarah, this is your <i>mom...</i><br />There you are, young man.
1386051 1388213 You mind your mother.
1392349 1395967 <i>Hi, Sarah. Stan Morsky.<br />Somethings come up.</i>
1396145 1399388 <i>Looks like I won't be able to make it<br />tonight. Just can't get out of it.</i>
1399565 1404310 <i>I'm really sorry. I'll make it up<br />to you. Call you in a day or so. Bye.</i>
1406071 1409484 That bum. So what if he has a Porsche?
1409658 1413117 He can't treat you like this.<br />It's Friday night, for Christ's sake.
1414204 1416195 I'll live.
1416373 1418455 I'll break his kneecaps.
1419168 1423537 Well, Pugsley still loves me.<br />Don't you, baby?
1424465 1426752 God. It's disgusting.
1429011 1431548 I'm gonna go to a movie, kiddo.<br />Have a good time.
1431722 1434635 We will. You, too.<br />OK.
1438687 1440803 Damn it, Matt.
1497579 1500321 Oh, shit.<br />Lieutenant!
1500499 1503992 These killings occurred in the order<br />of their listings in the phone book.
1504169 1507082 What can I tell you? No comment.<br />But, Lieutenant...
1519560 1521642 That coffee's two hours cold.
1522896 1524807 I put a cigarette out in it.
1525983 1529317 Did you reach the next girl yet?<br />No. I got her answering machine.
1529486 1531773 Send a unit.<br />I sent a unit. There's no answer.
1531947 1534109 The apartment manager's not in.<br />Call her.
1534283 1536490 I just called her.<br />Call her again.
1537619 1539201 Give me a cigarette.
1549465 1554175 <i>Hi, there. Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.</i>
1554344 1559009 <i>But don't be shy. It's OK. Machines need<br />love, too, so talk to it...</i>
1564354 1565810 Same shit.
1567149 1571234 I can hear it now. He's gonna be<br />called the goddamn Phone Book Killer.
1571403 1576648 I hate these press cases.<br />Especially the weird press cases.
1578160 1580618 Where are you going?<br />To make a statement.
1580788 1582950 Maybe make these jackals work for us<br />for a change.
1583123 1587663 If I can get on the tube by 11:00,<br />maybe she'll call us.
1587836 1590419 Well, how do I look?
1590589 1593877 Like shit, boss.<br />Your mama.
1595010 1598173 <i>This just in. Police have announced<br />the name of the victim</i>
1598347 1602386 <i>in the second of two execution<br />style murders which took place today.</i>
1602559 1606348 <i>Incredibly, the names of the<br />two victims are virtually identical.</i>
1606522 1611062 <i>Two hours ago, 35-year-old Sarah Ann<br />Connor was pronounced dead...</i>
1611819 1614026 Can we change this?<br />Sarah Louise Connor...
1614196 1615778 Don't touch it!
1617866 1622406 <i>Police are refusing to speculate on the<br />similarity between the shooting deaths</i>
1622579 1626664 <i>and no other connection between the<br />two victims has been established yet.</i>
1626834 1630202 <i>We'll have more on this<br />late-breaking story as it comes in.</i>
1721386 1723627 Hey, you got a phone?<br />It's in the back.
1723805 1726092 Hey, $4.50.
1765514 1768552 <i>You have reached the Los Angeles<br />Police Department emergency number.</i>
1768725 1773515 <i>All lines are busy. If you need a police<br />car sent out to you, stay on the line.</i>
1837794 1839159 Pugsley! Shoo!
1839338 1841955 Go on. I'm gonna make a belt out of you.
1856772 1858604 Don't make me bust you up, man.
1919501 1922960 <i>Hi, there. Fooled you.<br />You're talking to a machine.</i>
1923130 1925997 <i>But don't be shy. It's OK.<br />Machines need love, too.</i>
1926174 1930133 <i>So talk to it and Ginger, that's me,<br />or Sarah will get back to you.</i>
1930303 1931793 <i>Wait for the beep.</i>
1933265 1935256 <i>Ginger, this is Sarah.<br />Pick up if you're there.</i>
1935434 1941271 <i>I'm at this place on Pico Boulevard<br />called Tech Noir. I'm really scared.</i>
1941440 1946355 I think that there's somebody after me.<br />I hope that you play this back soon.
1946528 1949646 I need you and Matt to come<br />and pick me up as soon as possible.
1950407 1953525 The police keep transferring me around.<br />I'm gonna give 'em another try.
1953702 1957946 <i>The number here is 555-9175.</i>
1958123 1960034 <i>Call me, kiddo. I need your help.</i>
1977184 1978470 <i>It's her.</i>
1979811 1981973 Sarah Connor? It's Lieutenant Traxler.
1982147 1985390 Lieutenant, don't put me on hold and<br />don't transfer me to another department.
1985567 1988059 Don't worry, I won't. Just relax.<br />Can you tell me where you are?
1988236 1992070 <i>I'm in this bar called Tech Noir.</i><br />Yeah, I <i>know it. It's on</i> Pico.
1992240 1994777 Are you all right?<br />Yeah, but I don't wanna leave.
1994951 1998819 I think there's a guy following me.<br />Now, listen carefully.
1998997 2001364 You're in a public place so<br />you'll be safe till we get there.
2001541 2003828 But stay visible. Don't go outside<br />or even to the restroom.
2004002 2006744 <i>I'll have</i> a <i>car there in</i> a <i>minute.</i><br /><i>OK.</i>
2031029 2032986 Hey, that guy didn't pay.
2192941 2194682 Come with me if you wanna live.
2203827 2204817 Come on!
2278109 2280692 This is one-L-19.<br />I got a hit-and-run felony.
2280862 2285197 Suspect vehicle: late model<br />gray Ford headed westbound on Seventh.
2285366 2287698 He's really moving,<br />punching lights all the way.
2287869 2291658 I'm gonna need an ambulance<br />at Seventh and Broadway right now.
2292999 2294034 Hold it!
2311184 2312094 Hold on.
2324072 2327736 Are you injured? Are you shot?
2333289 2336657 Do exactly what I say. Exactly.
2336835 2340373 Don't move unless I say.<br />Don't make a sound unless I say.
2340547 2341958 Do you understand?
2342882 2346500 Do you understand?<br />Yes! Please don't hurt me.
2364696 2366437 I'm here to help you.
2366614 2371199 I'm Reese. Sergeant Tech-Com.<br />DN38416. Assigned to protect you.
2371369 2373076 You've been targeted for termination.
2383256 2387625 This is one-L-19. Westbound<br />on Olympic, approaching Overland.
2392307 2395766 This is a mistake. I didn't do anything.
2395935 2399644 No, but you will.<br />It's very important that you live.
2399814 2403182 This isn't true. How could that man<br />just get up after you...
2403359 2405726 It's not a man. A machine.
2405904 2409863 A Terminator.<br />Cyberdyne Systems model 101.
2417999 2421958 A machine? Like a robot?
2422128 2426622 Not a robot. A cyborg.<br />Cybernetic organism.
2426799 2429712 No. He was bleeding.<br />Just a second.
2433097 2434132 Get your head down!
2479102 2480183 All right, listen.
2480353 2484722 The Terminator's an infiltration unit.<br />Part man, part machine.
2484899 2488984 Underneath it's a hyper-alloy combat<br />chassis. Microprocessor controlled.
2489153 2493772 Fully armored, very tough.<br />But outside it's living human tissue.
2493950 2498035 Flesh, skin, hair, blood...<br />grown for the cyborgs.
2498204 2500741 Look, Reese, I don't know...<br />Pay attention.
2500915 2502201 I gotta ditch this car.
2507839 2512003 The 600-Series had rubber skin.<br />We spotted them easy.
2512176 2514634 But these are new. They look human.
2514804 2518422 Sweat, bad breath, everything.<br />Very hard to spot.
2518599 2522308 I had to wait till he moved on you<br />before I could zero him.
2522478 2527939 Look, I am not stupid.<br />They cannot make things like that yet.
2528109 2532148 Not yet. Not for about 40 years.
2534782 2536693 Are you saying it's from the future?
2536868 2538950 One possible future.
2539954 2543242 From your point of view,<br />I don't know tech stuff.
2544417 2546624 Then you're from the future, too.<br />Is that right?
2546794 2548910 Right.<br />Right.
2557180 2562471 Cyborgs don't feel pain.<br />I do. Don't do that again.
2562643 2566477 Just let me go.<br />Listen and understand.
2566647 2570390 That Terminator is out there.
2570568 2574232 It can't be bargained with,<br />it can't be reasoned with.
2574906 2579116 It doesn't feel pity or remorse or fear
2579285 2585156 and it absolutely will not stop,<br />ever, until you are dead.
2595343 2597209 Can you stop it?
2601474 2602805 I don't know.
2604685 2606926 With these weapons, I don't know.
2623454 2627743 <i>All units. Ford suspect vehicle has<br />been found in a parking structure...</i>
2671377 2675666 Reese, why me?
2677758 2679294 Why does it want me?
2685975 2688091 There was a nuclear war.
2690271 2692888 A few years from now...
2694609 2699354 ...all this, this whole place,<br />everything...
2700239 2704858 ...it's gone. Just gone.
2705912 2707619 There were survivors.
2707788 2710780 Here, there.
2712585 2715043 Nobody even knew who started it.
2717715 2722460 It was the machines, Sarah.<br />I don't understand.
2722637 2725755 Defense network computers.
2725932 2729095 New, powerful...
2730603 2734517 ...hooked into everything,<br />trusted to run it all.
2735316 2739731 They say it got smart...<br />a new order of intelligence.
2741489 2744652 Then it saw all people as a threat.<br />Not just the ones on the other side.
2746661 2749449 It decided our fate in a microsecond.
2751123 2752864 Extermination.
2767265 2768755 Did you see this war?
2781195 2785985 No. I grew up after. In the ruins.
2786158 2789196 Starving. Hiding from the H-Ks.
2789370 2792362 H-Ks?<br />Hunter-killers.
2792540 2796283 Patrol machines<br />built in automated factories.
2796460 2800704 Most of us were rounded up,<br />put in camps for orderly disposal.
2802758 2805045 This was burned in by laser scanner.
2809015 2813555 Some of us were kept alive. To work.
2814520 2815885 Loading bodies.
2817023 2819731 The disposal units ran night and day.
2819900 2822767 We were that close<br />to going out forever.
2825865 2829733 But there was one man<br />who taught us to fight.
2829910 2831821 To storm the wire of the camps.
2831996 2835284 To smash those metal<br />motherfuckers into junk.
2836917 2839659 He turned it around.<br />He brought us back from the brink.
2839837 2844081 His name was Connor. John Connor.
2844258 2848718 Your son, Sarah. Your unborn son.
2958497 2959487 Drive!
2966797 2967878 Reese!
2968716 2969877 Reese!
2987902 2991270 No, Reese. No, no, no. They'll kill you.
2991447 2994280 You in the Cadillac,<br />let me see your hands now.
2997453 2998443 Get out of the car.
3002208 3004415 Drop to your knees.
3004585 3007202 Out of the car.<br />Drop to the ground.
3036534 3040448 Sarah. Sarah, try to drink some of this.
3043457 3045619 Listen, are you sure it's them?
3045793 3048581 I mean,<br />maybe I should look at the bodies.
3048754 3051621 No. They've been identified<br />and there's no doubt.
3055469 3057335 Ginger.
3058931 3062390 Kiddo.<br />Sarah...
3062560 3065723 Sarah, this is Dr. Silberman.<br />Hi, Sarah.
3065896 3069935 I want you to tell him everything<br />Reese told you. Do you feel up to that?
3070109 3072191 Yeah, I guess so.
3073988 3077822 You're a doctor?<br />Criminal psychologist.
3077992 3082202 Is Reese crazy?<br />That's what we're gonna find out.
3167414 3170907 So you're a soldier. Fighting for whom?
3172419 3177459 With the 132nd under Perry.<br />From '21 to '27.
3178258 3180716 That's the year <i>2027?</i>
3180886 3182968 <i>That's right. Then I was assigned...</i>
3183138 3186756 This is fucking great.<br />...under John Connor.
3186934 3190017 Who was the enemy?<br />A computer defense system built...
3190187 3192724 Goddamn. Sorry.
3192898 3196232 ...built for SAC-NORAD<br />by Cyberdyne Systems.
3196402 3198359 I see.
3198529 3204400 And this computer thinks it can win<br />by killing the mother of its enemy.
3204576 3207785 Killing him, in effect,<br />before he's even conceived.
3207955 3210037 A sort of retroactive abortion?
3211834 3215077 Silberman cracks me up.<br />Last week, a guy burned his Afghan.
3215254 3217746 He screwed it first...<br />Ed, shut up.
3217923 3220255 Why didn't the computer<br />just kill Connor then?
3220426 3222963 Why this elaborate scheme<br />with the Terminator?
3223137 3227222 It had no choice.<br />Their defense grid was smashed.
3227391 3231806 We'd won. Taking out Connor then<br />would make no difference.
3231979 3234767 Skynet had to wipe out<br />his entire existence.
3234940 3239980 Is that when you captured the lab<br />complex and found... What is it called?
3240154 3242316 The time displacement equipment?
3242489 3246528 That's right. The Terminator<br />had already gone through.
3246702 3249569 Connor sent me to intercept<br />and they blew the whole place.
3249747 3251579 Well, how are you supposed to get back?
3252458 3254165 I can't.
3255669 3261255 Nobody goes home.<br />Nobody else comes through.
3262009 3265092 It's just him and me.
3369533 3372366 <i>It's just him and me.</i>
3375455 3380416 <i>Why didn't you bring any weapons?<br />Something more advanced.</i>
3380586 3383544 <i>Don't you have ray guns?</i>
3383714 3387378 <i>Ray</i> guns.<br /><i>Show me</i> a <i>piece of future technology.</i>
3387551 3391920 <i>You go naked. Something about the<br />field generated by a living organism.</i>
3392097 3394134 <i>Nothing dead will go.<br />Why?</i>
3394308 3395969 <i>I didn't build the fucking thing.</i>
3396143 3400888 <i>OK, OK. But this cyborg,<br />if it's metal...?</i>
3401064 3403476 <i>Surrounded by living tissue.<br />Oh, right.</i>
3404276 3407018 This is great stuff.<br />I could make a career out of this guy.
3407195 3409983 See how clever it is?<br />It doesn't require a shred of proof.
3410157 3413616 Most paranoid delusions are intricate,<br />but this is brilliant.
3415954 3419913 <i>Why were the other two women killed?<br />Most records were lost in the war.</i>
3420083 3422666 <i>Skynet knew almost nothing<br />about Connor's mother.</i>
3422836 3426249 <i>Her full name, where she lived.<br />They just knew the city.</i>
3426423 3429506 <i>The Terminator was<br />just being systematic.</i>
3429676 3432509 <i>Let's go back...<br />Look, you have heard enough.</i>
3432679 3435637 <i>I have answered your questions,<br />now I have to see Sarah Connor.</i>
3435807 3439766 <i>I'm afraid that's not up to me.<br />Then why am I talking to you?</i>
3439937 3441769 <i>Who is in authority here?<br />Please...</i>
3441939 3443475 <i>Shut up!</i>
3444232 3446849 <i>You still don't get it, do you?</i>
3447027 3452113 <i>He'll find her. That's what he does.<br />That's all he does.</i>
3452282 3454023 <i>You can't stop him.</i>
3454201 3457819 <i>He'll reach down her throat<br />and pull her fucking heart out!</i>
3457996 3460954 <i>Doc.<br />Let go of me!</i>
3464419 3465409 sorry-
3470842 3472207 So Reese is crazy?
3472386 3475879 In technical terminology, he's a loon.
3476723 3482184 Sarah, this is what they call<br />body armor. Our TAC guys wear these.
3482354 3484470 It'll stop a 12-gauge round.
3484648 3486855 This other individual must've<br />been wearing one under his coat.
3487025 3488686 Feel that. Go ahead.
3490988 3494572 He punched through the windshield.<br />He was probably on PCP.
3494741 3497403 Broke every bone in his hand.<br />He wouldn't feel it for hours.
3497577 3499159 There was this guy once...<br />You see this scar?
3499329 3500740 Here.<br />Thank you.
3502165 3505908 There's a couch in this other room.<br />Stretch out and get some sleep.
3506086 3508418 Be at least an hour before<br />your mother gets here from Big Bear.
3508588 3511671 I can't sleep.<br />Try.
3511842 3516086 It may not look it,<br />but that couch is very comfortable.
3517389 3521883 You'll be perfectly safe.<br />We got 30 cops in this building.
3522769 3524009 Thank you.
3530485 3532317 Good night.<br />Good night.
3547169 3550787 I'm a friend of Sarah Connor.<br />I was told she's here. Could I see her?
3550964 3553126 No. Can't see her.<br />She's making a statement.
3553300 3554415 Where is she?
3555385 3558173 It may take a while. If you wanna wait,<br />there's a bench over there.
3569733 3571223 I'll be back.
3619699 3622236 Are they terrorists?<br />Let's go, let's go!
3626915 3628280 Stay here.
3642514 3644050 Let's get outta here!
3668498 3669613 Watch him.
3737484 3738815 Ed...
3739694 3741025 Hey!
3767722 3769178 Sarah!
3770517 3771848 Reese.
3775772 3776933 This way.
3817731 3820393 <i>KFLB news time 4:36.</i>
3820567 3824276 <i>Top story of the hour: the largest<br />single law enforcement mobilization</i>
3824446 3827029 <i>in California history<br />is currently underway.</i>
3827198 3830782 <i>Police in five counties are engaged<br />in a massive manhunt for...</i>
3834372 3835737 Take this.
3838835 3840542 All right,<br />let's get this off the road.
3872535 3875402 You cold?<br />Freezing.
3889386 3890547 Reese?
3892472 3896181 You got a first name?<br />Kyle.
3896351 3900640 Kyle, what's it like<br />when you go through time?
3903483 3905315 White light.
3907779 3909110 Pain.
3912409 3916653 It's like being born maybe.<br />Oh, my God.
3917580 3919491 I caught one back there.
3921084 3923826 You mean you got shot?<br />It's not bad.
3924712 3928171 We gotta get you to a doctor.<br />It's OK. Forget it.
3928341 3933006 What do you mean, forget it?<br />Are you crazy? Take this off.
3945275 3947266 Jesus.
3947444 3950311 See? It passed right through the meat.
3950488 3952104 This is gonna make me puke.
3952866 3955654 Would you just talk about something?<br />What?
3955827 3959286 I don't know. Anything.<br />Just talk. Tell me about my son.
3961124 3962706 He's about my height.
3966379 3968370 He has your eyes.
3971718 3973300 What's he like?
3974095 3977759 You trust him. He's got a strength.
3979476 3981342 I'd die for John Connor.
3984272 3987890 Well, at least now I know<br />what to name him.
3989068 3993813 Don't suppose you know who the father is<br /><i>so</i> I won't tell him to get lost?
3993990 3996732 John never said much about him.
3996910 3999402 I know he dies before the war...<br />Wait.
4001331 4003117 I don't wanna know.
4004417 4007125 So was it John that sent you here?
4007837 4009373 I volunteered.
4010632 4014421 Why?<br />It was a chance to meet the legend.
4015512 4022350 Sarah Connor,<br />who taught her son to fight, organize,
4022519 4024601 prepare from when he was a kid.
4024771 4026808 When you were in hiding before the war.
4030944 4034357 You're talking about things<br />I haven't done yet in the past tense.
4034531 4036397 It's driving me crazy.
4040286 4043028 Are you sure you have the right person?
4043206 4045243 I'm sure.
4045416 4049125 Come on. Do I look like<br />the mother of the future?
4050964 4055800 I mean, am I tough? Organized?<br />I can't even balance my checkbook.
4058596 4062715 Look, Reese, I didn't ask<br />for this honor and I don't want it.
4062892 4064348 Any of it.
4067647 4071857 Your son gave me a message<br />to give to you. Made me memorize it.
4073194 4075902 "Thank you, Sarah,<br />for your courage through the dark years."
4076072 4078188 I can't help you with<br />what you must soon face,
4078366 4080653 except to say the future is not set.
4080827 4083319 You must be stronger than<br />you imagine you can be.
4083496 4085988 "You must survive or I will never exist."
4087333 4088789 That's all.
4091754 4093290 It's a good field dressing.
4094841 4096331 You like it?
4097093 4098504 It's my first.
4102807 4105174 Get some sleep. It'll be light soon.
4109439 4110679 OK.
4121367 4123278 Talk to me some more.
4126539 4128075 About what?
4129292 4131408 Tell me about where you're from.
4133880 4135370 All right.
4137300 4141794 You stay down by day,<br />but at night you can move around.
4141971 4145885 You still have to be careful<br />because the H-Ks use infrared.
4148019 4153059 But they're not too bright.<br />John taught us ways to dust them.
4154525 4156766 That's when the infiltrators<br />started to appear.
4156944 4158981 The Terminators were the newest.
4159614 4160524 <i>The worst.</i>
4170583 4175168 <i>Traversing your sector in search mode.<br />750 meters north of your position.</i>
4180134 4181249 Let's go.
4226723 4230682 Reese. DN384...<br />Right. Let him in.
4322193 4324059 Terminator!
4401314 4403646 I was dreaming about dogs.
4404901 4407268 We use 'em to spot Terminators.
4408362 4410899 Your world is pretty terrifying.
4449695 4453609 Hey, buddy,<br />you got a dead cat in there or what?
4460957 4463119 Fuck you, asshole.
4481978 4483810 God damn.
4484897 4486353 Thank you.
4491737 4493227 Is this enough?
4493906 4497069 Yeah, it's enough.<br />I don't wanna ask where you got it.
4503416 4504906 I'm coming.<br />We need a room.
4505084 4507075 All right.<br />With a kitchen.
4507253 4508709 Do you have one with a kitchen?
4524770 4527603 I am dying for a shower.
4529233 4531395 We should check your bandage, too.
4531986 4534648 Later. I'm going out for supplies.
4539368 4540529 Keep this.
4566604 4569972 No, I can't tell you where I am, Mom.<br />I was told not to say.
4570149 4572311 <i>But I need to know where to reach you.</i>
4572485 4577605 <i>You tell me to hide out at the cabin<br />and you won't tell me what's going on?</i>
4577782 4580524 <i>I am worried sick here.</i>
4580701 4584444 OK. OK, here's the number.
4584622 4586829 You ready?<br />Yes. Go ahead.
4586999 4593666 <i>It's 408-555-1439. Room nine.</i>
4593839 4595580 <i>Got it?<br />We got“.</i>
4595758 4599922 <i>I gotta go. I'm sorry<br />I can't tell you more right now.</i>
4600096 4601837 <i>I love you, Mom.</i>
4605351 4607217 I love you, too, sweetheart.
4620116 4622528 Tiki <i>Motel.</i><br />Give me your address there.
4626205 4627286 What have we got?
4631001 4637122 Mothballs... corn syrup... ammonia.
4637299 4638915 What's for dinner?
4639635 4642718 Plastique.<br />That sounds good.
4642888 4644253 What is it?
4645182 4648720 It's a nitroglycerin base.<br />It's a bit more stable.
4648894 4650760 I learned to make it when I was a kid.
4662658 4664774 Make sure there's none on the threads.
4666996 4668407 Like this.
4670374 4672160 Screw the end cap on.
4674086 4675622 Very gently.
4678382 4680669 You must've had a fun childhood.
4684388 4685753 That's good.
4686724 4689762 All right. Six more like that<br />and I'll get started on the fuses.
4701238 4703195 He'll find us, won't he?
4706202 4707692 Probably.
4725804 4727920 It'll never be over, will it?
4736357 4738348 Look at me. I'm shaking.
4739568 4744654 Some legend.<br />You must be pretty disappointed.
4745741 4749655 No, I'm not.
4758379 4763670 Kyle, the women in your time,
4763842 4765924 what are they like?
4768013 4770095 Good fighters.
4770266 4772303 That's not what I meant.
4774478 4776310 Was there someone special?
4778357 4779893 Someone...?
4780526 4782688 A girl, you know.
4784196 4785561 No.
4788367 4789983 Never.
4791578 4793194 Never?
4798168 4801536 I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
4804425 4806507 So much pain.
4807886 4812221 Pain can be controlled.<br />You just disconnect it.
4812391 4814632 So you feel nothing?
4819815 4822728 John Connor gave me<br />a picture of you once.
4824653 4826439 I didn't know why at the time.
4827906 4833743 It was very old, torn, faded.
4837583 4843579 You were young like you are now.<br />You seemed just a little sad.
4845132 4847874 I used to always wonder<br />what you were thinking at that moment.
4849345 4851552 I memorized every line...
4853057 4854923 ...every curve.
4858604 4860515 I came across time for you, Sarah.
4862441 4866730 I love you. I always have.
4884797 4886458 I shouldn't have said that.
4977347 4978553 Think fast.
5068605 5069936 Trade places.
5080951 5084285 Faster! Drive faster!
5134212 5137375 Kyle! Oh, my God.
5171625 5172956 Kyle.
5188225 5189590 Son-of-a-bitch!
5205283 5206273 You stay here.
5230267 5231428 Let's get outta here.
5235105 5236345 Get out.
5253498 5256456 Kyle. Come on. Get up.
5265010 5267547 Kyle, come on.
5268680 5271547 Help me! Get out. Get out.
5296041 5297998 Don't stop. Run!
5430175 5431711 Sarah!
5432761 5434377 Kyle.
5439684 5442221 Kyle. Kyle...
5444314 5447056 We did it, Kyle. We got him.
5466795 5467876 No!
5468380 5469711 No!
5525603 5526889 Wait.
5531735 5533351 What are you doing?
5534237 5537400 Cover, so he can't track us.
5547125 5550288 Come on! Come on.
5550462 5554126 No, Kyle! Come on!
5554883 5556624 Come on!<br />Leave me here.
5567771 5572140 Move it, Reese! On your feet, soldier!
5572484 5574646 On your feet!
5575278 5576439 Move it!
5648143 5649804 Get back. Go back.
5684345 5686131 Run, Sarah.<br />No.
5686306 5687592 Run!
5691436 5693018 Run!
5693605 5695141 Come on, motherfucker.
5808136 5810298 No.
5928798 5930459 You're terminated, fucker.
5988649 5989889 Kyle.
6010922 6014916 Tape seven. November 10. Where was I?
6015885 6019719 What's most difficult is trying to<br />decide what to tell you and what not to.
6020431 6024425 But I guess I have a while before you're<br />old enough to understand these tapes.
6024602 6028345 They're more for me at this point<br />just so that I can get it straight.
6065476 6066807 Fill her up.
6070481 6073599 Should I tell you about your father?
6073776 6076017 Boy, that's a tough one.
6077572 6082066 Will it affect your decision to send him<br />here, knowing that he is your father?
6084328 6087070 If you don't send Kyle,<br />you can never be.
6087248 6090331 God, a person could go crazy<br />thinking about this.
6094005 6095871 I suppose I will tell you.
6097717 6099503 I owe him that.
6101929 6104261 Maybe it'll help if...
