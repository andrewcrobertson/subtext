596763 597472 You're...
598556 599307 ...from Baker?
610777 613029 Tell Baker that | told him<br />all that | know already.
613196 614823 Tell him | want to live in peace,<br />understand?
614989 617742 That it's no use<br />to go on tormenting me!
617909 620662 | know nothing at all<br />about that case of coins.
620829 621830 Now that gold has disappeared.
621996 625416 But if he'd listened to me,<br />we could have avoided this altogether.
626042 627836 | went to the Army court.
628002 629629 There were no witnesses.
629796 631923 They couldn't uncover any more.
632215 634968 | can't tell Baker<br />what happened to the money.
635135 636927 Go back and tell him that!
639471 641932 Word's around you had a visitor...
643600 645602 ...and Baker knows it.
647396 649356 Name of Jackson.
654570 656405 Jackson was here...
657948 660617 ...or Baker's got it all wrong.
667958 669960 He's not wrong.
670460 674923 Maybe Baker would like to know<br />just what you and Jackson had to Say...
675132 677341 ...about the cash box.
681262 684015 That's not what I'm being paid for.
687894 691981 I'm only interested in<br />what name Jackson's hiding under now!
695067 697737 Why do you think Jackson<br />may be assuming another name?
697904 700323 | would have found him already.
700990 704327 When | start off to find somebody,<br />| find them.
704493 706704 That's why they pay me.
712083 714628 What is Baker paying you?
717380 719007 That your family?
728892 729809 Yes.
730810 733063 Nice family.
735190 737567 What does he pay you for murdering me?
740654 742322 $500.
743323 744907 ...to get the name!
751205 752665 The name!
762216 763217 Carson.
763842 765469 Bill Carson.
765678 768430 That's what he calls himself now.
798711 801296 Here's a lot of money: $1,000.
805425 807093 $1,000...
809678 811430 ..and some in gold.
811680 813556 That's a tidy sum.
817601 819269 But when I'm paid...
819978 821770 ...l always see the job through.
894760 896178 It's you.
896804 898639 Any information?
900474 902101 Too much.
903644 906437 He said quite a bit<br />that should interest you...
906604 909107 ...and one or two things<br />that interested me.
909273 911149 Such as?
911608 914193 The name Jackson's hiding under is...
914360 915944 ...Bill Carson.
918196 920156 That's your bit.
922784 924160 Keep talking.
924577 927162 He also mentioned somethin’<br />about a certain...
927329 930416 ...cash box which just happened<br />to disappear.
931542 932960 That's my bit.
933669 935003 Anything else?
935879 938215 Not enough for you, huh?
938424 940300 Well, you don't have to worry.
940467 942844 He'll never say anything to anybody again!
944178 945762 Perfect.
946430 948265 Here you are.
948515 950225 Here, this is for you.
950392 952184 You did a good job for me.
952351 954019 Worth $500!
958023 959899 | almost forgot.
960066 962318 He gave me $1,000.
962569 964904 I think his idea was that | kill you.
972579 974664 But you know, the pity is,<br />when I'm paid...
975039 977542 ...l always follow my job through.
977834 979586 You know that.
1026174 1028383 No pistol, amigo.
1028550 1030218 It won't do you any good.
1030384 1031928 There are three of us.
1047026 1048027 Hey amigo.
1048611 1053366 You know that you have a face<br />beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?
1055910 1056911 Yeah.
1058746 1061499 But you don't look like<br />the one who will collect it.
1069590 1072260 A couple of steps back.
1126272 1127523 Thank you.
1137033 1138909 How much you worth now?

1145999 1147667 That's right, $2,000.
1148084 1149878 Yeah, $2,000.
1157093 1159179 Hijo de puta que te parié!
1159471 1161055 You'll pay for this!
1161221 1163932 | hope you end up in a graveyard...
1164099 1166684 ...with the cholera, and the rabies,<br />and the plague!
1166851 1170480 Cut me loose!<br />Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!
1170647 1171855 Put me down!
1172022 1174815 | hope your mother ends up<br />in a two-dollar whorehouse!
1174982 1177401 Cut me loose! Cut me loose!
1178485 1180277 You can still save yourself.
1180444 1183072 Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
1183322 1184865 Let me go!
1185949 1188827 I feel sick. The blood is rushing...
1190287 1191871 I'm dry.
1192830 1194749 Agua! Water!
1201506 1204008 You swine! You son of a bitch!
1206177 1208221 You're brave with a man who's tied up!
1208388 1209888 Come back!
1210055 1211931 Come back and fight!
1212932 1214892 You bastard!
1215851 1217269 Who the hell is that?
1217436 1219563 One bastard goes in, another comes out.
1219730 1221273 Cut it out! Cut it out!
1221440 1224652 I'm an honest farmer!<br />I'm innocent of any--
1227237 1229280 So, you're an honest farmer.
1229447 1231658 You recognize this man?
1232033 1234035 Yeah, it's you!
1235703 1238747 Who says so? You can't even read.
1239164 1240832 Roll it up. Roll it up!
1240998 1243501 I'll give you a good idea<br />where you can put it.

1250632 1251633 Judas!
1251800 1253260 You've sold my hide!
1254052 1256054 But you won't enjoy any of that money,<br />not a penny.
1256221 1259141 If there's justice,<br />that money will go to the undertakers!
1259307 1262268 Every penny of it.<br />You know who you are?
1262435 1264687 You want to know whose son you are?
1264854 1267148 You don't, | do. Everybody does.
1267314 1269150 You're the son of a thousand fathers!
1269316 1270776 All bastards like you!
1270943 1273654 And your mother? Your mother...

1385220 1386720 $3,000!
1390473 1393268 There are two kinds of people<br />in the world, my friend.
1393434 1394602 Those with a rope around their neck...
1394769 1397397 ...and the people who have the job<br />of doing the cutting.
1397564 1400692 Listen, the neck at the end<br />of the rope is mine!
1400859 1402861 | run the risks.
1403278 1406739 So, the next time, | want more than half!

1409492 1411744 ...1 do the cutting.
1412828 1415706 If we cut down my percentage...
1417040 1418500 cigar?
1420127 1423630 ...It might interfere with my aim.
1425048 1428844 But if you miss,<br />you had better miss very well.
1429011 1432639 Whoever double-crosses me<br />and leaves me alive...
1432806 1435934 ...he understands nothing about Tuco.
1436935 1438519 Nothing!
1442064 1444483 Wanted in 15 counties of this state...
1444650 1448446 ...the condemned, standing before us...<br />sitting before us...
1448613 1451824 ...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramirez...
1451991 1454200 ...has been found guilty<br />by the Third District Circuit Court...
1454367 1458120 ...Of the following crimes: murder,<br />assaulting a justice of the peace...

1460831 1464710 ...and statutory rape<br />of a minor of the black race...
1465085 1468630 ...Of derailing a train<br />in order to rob the passengers....
1474302 1476054 What'd you find out, Shorty?
1476220 1478014 If you ask me, it seems like a book!
1478181 1482310 An armed unit, escorting a cash box<br />of gold coins, meets a Yankee ambush...
1482477 1484854 ..and only three of them are saved.
1485021 1487357 Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.
1487523 1489859 The thing that wasn't saved, though,<br />was the coins.
1490026 1492737 But then the Army decides, of course,<br />it ought to hold a hearing...
1492904 1493947 ..and Jackson's acquitted.
1494113 1496950 He disappears, and becomes Bill Carson.
1497116 1498034 | know his name.
1498201 1501245 But you don't know<br />just who you're lookin’ for, and | do!
1501412 1505375 And when he's found,<br />I'd be scared to be put in his shoes!
1507794 1510672 - Where is Carson?<br />- All | Know is Carson re-enlisted.
1510838 1512214 The poor guy's minus an eye.
1512381 1514424 He lives with a girl called Maria,<br />who'll tell you.
1514591 1516968 She's a fresh young whore<br />in the territory.
1517134 1518052 Where is she?
1518219 1522098 Now, what's the name of that town?<br />It's someplace very near...
1524600 1526435 Santa Ana.
1528854 1531315 Adios, half-soldier.
1536404 1537612 Hand me down a whiskey!
1549207 1552460 Glad they got him.<br />A man guilty of all those crimes!
1552836 1554671 People with ropes around their necks<br />don't always hang.
1554838 1557257 What do you mean?
1558508 1562303 Even a filthy beggar like that<br />has a protecting angel.
1569060 1572355 A golden-haired angel watches over him.
1572522 1575191 Of all these crimes, the accused<br />has made a full, spontaneous confession.
1576483 1580195 Therefore, we condemn him<br />to be hung by the neck until dead.
1580362 1583615 May the Lord have mercy on his soul.<br />Proceed.
1598464 1600799 Let's get the hell out of here!
1632289 1634833 What are you saying?<br />Anybody can miss a shot?
1635000 1636835 Nobody misses<br />when I'm at the end of the rope!
1637002 1640506 You never had a rope around your neck.<br />Well, I'm going to tell you something.
1640672 1645010 When that rope starts to pull tight,<br />you can feel the devil bite your ass!
1647846 1649806 Yeah, you're right.
1650598 1652390 It's getting tougher.
1653350 1655142 The way | figure...
1655309 1659438 ...there's really not too much future<br />with a sawed-off runt like you.
1659605 1660940 What do you mean?
1661107 1665194 ‘Cause | don't think you'll ever<br />be worth more than $3,000.
1665694 1667780 What do you mean?
1667947 1671075 I mean, our partnership is untied.
1671867 1673786 Oh no, not you.
1673953 1675788 You remain tied.
1675955 1678791 I'll keep the money,<br />and you can have the rope.
1678958 1683045 You filthy, double-crossing bastard!<br />Of all the stinking, dirty tricks--
1683212 1686005 The way back to town is only 70 miles.
1687340 1691052 If you save your breath,<br />| feel a man like you could manage it.
1691219 1692345 Adios.
1692512 1695473 You filthy bastard! Come here!
1695890 1698768 Come here! Cut this rope off!<br />Get off that horse!
1698935 1700979 Get off that horse! You filthy coward!
1701146 1702230 If | ever catch you...
1702397 1704440 ...I'll rip your heart out and eat it!
1704607 1708360 I'll skin you alive!<br />I'll hang you up by your tongue.
1709778 1712531 Mil kill you! Fl kill you!
1714241 1718745 Such ingratitude, after all the times<br />I've saved your life.
1726170 1727588 You wouldn't leave me here...
1727754 1729173 Come back!
1729339 1731800 Wait! Listen, Blondie!
1733302 1735470 Hijo de una gran puta!
1773508 1775468 You filthy rats!
1791817 1793319 Maria.
1800243 1802245 Is that you, Bill?
1814382 1816258 Who are you?
1816424 1818384 What do you want with me?
1818550 1821428 Go on talking about Bill Carson.
1821887 1824264 I don't know him.
1824889 1828184 You were calling to him in the dark!
1831813 1832897 Where is he?
1833064 1835692 What are you gonna do?
1836734 1839404 I'll ask the questions!
1840822 1842782 Where is he?
1849831 1851291 Where is he?
1859882 1862051 That's enough!
1863052 1864512 I don't know where he is.
1864679 1868141 He packed his things ten days ago,<br />and went away with his unit.
1868308 1869767 They all left.
1869934 1872270 Which company? Where'd he go?
1876149 1879110 Third Cavalry, General Sibley.
1879819 1882030 They left for Santa Fe.
1882196 1884866 That's all | know. | swear!
1977166 1980253 I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.

2244763 2245639 Come here!
2276169 2277921 This morning | heard the whole thing.
2278088 2280215 They say Colonel Canby's closing in<br />with his Northerners...
2280382 2283093 ..and no later than tomorrow<br />that they'll be in the city.
2283260 2286138 That's why these Southerners<br />are getting out!
2286304 2290517 You see, as soon as these cowards hear<br />there are blue shirts around, they run.
2290684 2293520 - These rebels have no will to fight!<br />- Poor things.
2293687 2295147 They'll soon be finished.
2295313 2296397 We get rid of these bastards...
2296564 2298941 ...then we begin making money<br />on those Yankees.
2299108 2303279 They carry gold, not paper dollars.<br />And they're going to beat the South.
2304447 2307616 Look, see that one with the white beard<br />sitting in the wagon?
2307783 2311495 General Sibley. He looks dead.<br />He's finally getting out of our hair.
2311662 2314582 Hooray for Dixie!<br />Hooray, hooray for Dixie!
2320337 2322840 Where's the owner of that horse?
2323007 2324133 Please, mister, sir...
2324300 2326260 -...a bad heart condition....<br />- Where?
2326427 2328804 The war has frightened me already.
2329138 2331515 I'm looking for the owner of that horse.
2331682 2334851 He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar,<br />and he's a pig!
2335268 2336519 Where is he now?!
2336686 2339481 You leave him be! He doesn't know<br />who rides every horse!
2339731 2342524 You stay quiet, old hen!

2359956 2362959 You rotten criminals, how dare you?!
2530210 2532002 Your spurs.
2543806 2546475 There are two kinds of spurs, my friend.
2546642 2549435 Those that come in by the door...
2549602 2552021 ..and those that come in by the window.
2552188 2554524 Take off that pistol belt.
2561864 2563824 It's empty.
2565951 2567953 Mine isn't.
2574001 2577962 Even when Judas hanged himself,<br />there was a storm, too.
2581339 2583758 That could be cannon fire.
2583925 2587470 Cannon fire or storm,<br />it's all the same to you!
2589764 2592559 You ever see this before, my friend?
2601693 2604320 Throw it over the roof beam.
2606156 2608199 That's it.
2619210 2621337 And get on that!
2631056 2632766 That's right.
2632932 2635351 Now, make sure the rope is tight!
2635643 2638604 It's got to hold the weight of a pig!
2644735 2647571 Now, put the rope around your neck!
2654203 2656246 Yes, very good.
2657247 2659249 It's too big for your neck?
2659416 2661251 We'll fix that right away.
2661418 2663002 | have another system.
2663169 2665922 A little different than yours.
2666172 2668132 I don't shoot the rope.
2668299 2670593 | shoot the legs off the stool!
2675014 2676682 Adios.
2858197 2861742 ... guilty of the following crimes:<br />horse theft...
2880136 2882263 And Shorty?
2905745 2907872 Sorry, Shorty!
2908706 2911167 Move, come on, let's go!
2935649 2938903 I don't know. As soon as | hit<br />the desert, I'm thirsty.
2939153 2940279 Burns, huh?
2940446 2944158 They say people with fair skin<br />can't take too much.
2968474 2971811 Like that, you won't<br />have to carry so much.
2973145 2975105 Where are we going?
2975522 2976730 Where?
2976897 2979233 Where I'm going, amigo.
2979983 2981485 Over that way.
2981652 2985072 Another 100 miles<br />of beautiful sunbaked sand.
2985864 2988200 Even the armies are afraid<br />to march through there.
2988367 2990576 Sibley's men are retreating up there.
2990743 2993454 Canby’s men are coming here...
2994038 2997458 ...but no one will set foot<br />in this hell...
2998376 3000837 ..except you and me.
3002337 3005549 One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.
3008009 3011138 What was it you told me the last time?
3012597 3016810 “If you save your breath,<br />| feel a man like you could manage it.”
3018602 3021605 And if you won't manage it, you'll die.
3021772 3023274 Only slowly.
3024358 3026819 Very slowly, old friend.
3032116 3035035 After you, please. Start walking.
3151485 3153571 Taking a rest?
3154029 3158409 Come on, Blondie, we don't have<br />very far to go. Only 70 miles.
3159909 3163496 Only eight and a half hours more<br />before sunset.
3163663 3165957 That's not too bad.
3167041 3168835 Come on!
3292083 3294043 And so, Blondie...
3296295 3298339 .. It's goodbye.
3524565 3528194 $200,000 in gold. It's yours.<br />Just get me water!
3533532 3535660 What's that you say?
3535826 3537328 Who the hell are you?
3539705 3542082 My name's Bill Carson now.
3542999 3544583 Surprise attack.
3546418 3547294 All dead.
3547461 3550506 My name is Jackson. Not Carson.
3550881 3552716 Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.
3552883 3556387 I'm Lincoln's grandfather.<br />What was that you said about the dollars?
3556553 3558597 $200,000, all mine.
3559848 3562433 Was the Third Cavalry's.
3562892 3564978 Baker has nothing.
3565561 3566688 The gold...
3566854 3569774 | hid the gold. The gold is safe!
3570525 3572401 Where? Here?
3573693 3575444 Talk!
3575861 3577905 In the cemetery.
3578072 3580032 Which cemetery?
3581075 3583369 On Sad Hill.
3583536 3585328 There's a grave by the...
3586162 3587622 Which grave?
3587789 3590166 Have a name? Have a number?
3590333 3592669 Come on, you dummy, talk!
3594295 3596548 There's no number.
3597007 3598507 There's a name.
3599675 3601884 It's written.
3608474 3609766 Water!
3612561 3615313 You talk first, eh?<br />I'll give you the water later!
3615480 3617148 Sad Hill Cemetery, okay?
3617314 3618482 In a grave, okay.
3618649 3621152 But it must have<br />a name or a number on it.
3621318 3624279 There must be 1,000, 5,000, you...!
3628158 3629993 Don't die.
3630160 3632454 Don't die! I'll get you water!
3632620 3635915 Stay there.<br />Don't move, I'll get you water.
3636082 3638418 Don't die until later!
3664152 3665444 Get away from there!
3671991 3673785 He's dead.
3677330 3679122 Mil kill you!
3681541 3684753 If you do that, you'll always be poor.
3685837 3689049 Just like the greasy rat that you are.
3689466 3691551 If | were you, I'd...
3691718 3693302 ...keep me alive.
3693469 3695805 What did he tell you?
3696972 3698140 A name.
3699350 3701185 Name on a grave.
3701435 3703145 What name?
3716867 3718953 Blondie, don't die.
3720037 3722498 Don't die! I'm your friend.
3722748 3726335 Please don't die. Please! I'm your friend!
3729463 3731590 lil help you. I'll help you!
3731757 3734635 Don't move. I'll be right back.<br />I'll get the water.
3734802 3737221 Don't die like that pig.
3738764 3740348 Water, Blondie?
3740515 3742475 Don't drink! It's no good for you.
3742642 3744434 Feel better?
3744601 3748272 Blondie, what's the matter?<br />Please don't die!
3777009 3778260 I've got a very sick man here.
3778427 3779845 But we have no more beds here.
3780012 3782347 Let him have yours!
3787561 3789813 - Where is Pablo Ramirez?<br />- Padre Ramirez.
3789980 3791607 He is away at the moment.
3791857 3794193 He should be back any day now.
3794359 3798739 It doesn't matter. For the moment,<br />we'll take very good care of my friend.
3798906 3800365 May God be praised.
3800532 3801658 In case you didn't know it...
3801825 3805662 ...God is on our side, too.<br />Because He hates the Yanks.
3807372 3808748 Father, is he still breathing?
3808915 3811000 Yes, of course.
3811667 3813586 You're heavy.
3855419 3858380 All right, put a fresh bandage on him.
3859339 3861591 Put him in my cell.
3866596 3868973 Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.
3869139 3873143 Look out for him, please.<br />He's like a brother to me!
3892121 3894914 Father, did he speak?<br />Did he say anything?
3925320 3927905 Did he ask for me?<br />Did he speak about anything?
3928072 3930742 No, he hasn't spoken as yet.<br />But you mustn't worry.
3930908 3934746 He's both young and strong.<br />That's what's kept him going until now.
3934912 3937582 He should regain his strength<br />in a very short time.
3937749 3941961 Thank you, Father. You don't know<br />how much this boy's life means to me!
4020706 4024459 The old Father tells me<br />you'll be up and around in a few days.
4024626 4028003 You're very lucky to have me<br />so close when it happened.
4028337 4030756 Think, if you'd been on your own.
4033092 4034635 I mean, when...
4034802 4037221 ...when one is ill...
4037555 4041016 ...It's good to have somebody close by,<br />friends or relations.
4043018 4044520 Do you...
4044687 4046856 ...you have parents, Blondie?
4047314 4048774 A mother?
4048941 4051152 Not even a mother.
4051902 4053194 No one.
4054070 4056906 You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.
4057574 4060285 We're all alone in the world.
4060452 4062370 | have you, you have me.
4065457 4067792 Only for a little while, | mean.
4068168 4070128 It had to happen now.
4070795 4073214 What a dirty rotten trick of fate!
4073381 4076468 We could have all that money<br />in our hands.
4082849 4085393 I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
4085560 4088729 In my place, you would do the same thing.
4090189 4092441 It's all over for you now.
4093150 4096111 There's nothing anyone can do anymore.
4100240 4102534 It's my fault! Mine, mine!
4115172 4119009 I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.<br />If | knew that my last hour had come...
4119176 4123597 ...| swear, in my place, in your place,<br />| would do the same thing.
4124805 4128059 | would tell about the gold.<br />Yes, yes | would!
4128226 4130561 | would tell the name on the grave.
4130728 4133356 After all, what good is the money to you<br />if you're dead?
4133523 4135483 I know the name of the cemetery.
4135650 4138694 But you know how many graves<br />there are there?
4138861 4139987 Please.
4142114 4144074 Please, have a little.
4147369 4150330 Coffee? Please tell me the name.
4152415 4153959 On the grave.
4154793 4157796 If | get my hands on the $200,000...
4159631 4162216 ...I'll always honor your memory.
4162716 4165844 | swear it! I'll always honor your memory!
4168889 4170849 Come closer.
4175896 4176980 Tell me.
4182569 4184862 I'll sleep better...
4186154 4188739 ...knowing my good friend...
4188990 4190950 ..1S by my side...
4191117 4192617 ...to protect me.
4204129 4206464 “Tuco, water. Please, water.”
4206798 4210343 But if | get that name from you,<br />I'll give you water!
4217267 4220060 All right, you dirty skunk,<br />get your ass off the bed!
4220227 4222271 Come on, come on, the party's over.
4222438 4224148 The wagon is all ready to go.
4224440 4226316 From the way the wounded<br />are pouring into this place...
4226482 4229485 ...we better get the hell out of here<br />before we get caught up in the war.
4229652 4232363 Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
4232530 4236659 This is something I have to look into.<br />It'll only take a minute. Get moving.
4236826 4238453 - Where? This way?<br />- Yes.
4256262 4257346 Hey, Pablo!
4265854 4268106 Don't you recognize me?
4269650 4271401 It's me, Tuco!
4272361 4274696 Let me embrace you.
4277783 4280702 I don't know the right thing!
4284748 4287042 | was just passing by here.<br />| said to myself...
4287250 4291088 ...l wonder if my brother<br />remembers his brother.
4293507 4295342 Did | do wrong?
4296677 4299221 It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.
4299388 4301640 You've seen me, Tuco.
4303516 4306101 Yeah, well, I'm very glad | came.
4311940 4314901 Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.
4316236 4319531 Let's talk about you. It's more important.
4319864 4321700 You look very well.
4322242 4324911 A bit thin, perhaps, but...
4326037 4328998 ...you always were thin, eh Pablito?
4331668 4333753 What about our parents?
4334963 4337257 Only now do you think of them?
4338425 4340468 To begin after nine years?
4342637 4344513 Nine years?
4345805 4347265 So it's nine years.
4350810 4353855 Our mother has been dead a long time now.
4355022 4358317 Our father died only a few days ago.
4358484 4360360 That's why | was away.
4362612 4364948 He asked for you to be there.
4365115 4367409 But there was only me.
4374249 4376209 And you?
4376376 4379463 Outside of evil,<br />what else have you managed to do?
4380839 4384342 It seems to me<br />you once had a wife someplace.
4386762 4388764 Not one, lots of them!
4388930 4391558 One here, one there,<br />wherever | found them.
4392726 4395562 Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
4397272 4399608 What good would that be?
4400859 4403278 Just keep on the way you're going.
4403445 4404863 Go away.
4406281 4407449 The Lord have mercy on your soul.
4407616 4411119 I'll go, I'll go. While I'm waiting<br />for the Lord to remember me...
4411286 4414831 .. |, Tuco Ramirez,<br />brother of Brother Ramirez...
4414998 4416917 ...will tell you something.
4417083 4419002 You think you're better than | am.
4419169 4421713 Where we came from,<br />if one did not want to die of poverty...
4421880 4424174 ...one became a priest or a bandit!
4424341 4426843 You chose your way, | chose mine.
4427010 4428637 Mine was harder.
4428804 4430472 You talk of our mother and father.
4430639 4432682 You remember when you left<br />to become a priest.
4432849 4434141 I stayed behind!
4434308 4438061 | must have been ten, twelve.<br />I don't remember which, but | stayed.
4438228 4440522 I tried, but it was no good.
4440688 4442732 Now | am going to tell you something.
4442899 4444359 You became a priest because you were...
4444526 4447487 ...too much of a coward to do what | do!
4478017 4480270 Please, forgive me, brother.
4509966 4511634 My belly's full.
4513261 4515221 Nice guy, my brother.
4515555 4517891 I didn't tell you<br />my brother was in charge here.
4518057 4520143 Everything, like the pope almost.
4520310 4522145 He's in charge in Rome.
4522312 4525732 My brother, he says to me:<br />"Stay, brother, don't go home."
4525899 4527567 "We never see each other."
4527734 4532071 “Here, there's plenty to eat and drink.<br />Bring your friend, too."
4532238 4534490 Whenever we see each other,<br />he never lets me go.
4534657 4536951 It's always the same story.
4537118 4539746 My brother, he's crazy about me.
4543583 4544417 That's so.
4544584 4547879 Even a tramp like me,<br />no matter what happens...
4548713 4554218 ...| know there's a brother somewhere<br />who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.
4555594 4557012 Sure.
4558388 4562351 Well, after a meal,<br />there's nothing like a good cigar.
4630335 4631795 Wake up, you!
4632170 4633546 The troops are coming!
4633713 4635715 Blue or gray?
4642470 4646725 They're gray like us. Let's say "hello"<br />to them and then get going.
4646891 4650060 Hurrah for the Confederacy! Hurrah!
4650227 4652229 Down with General Grant!
4652396 4655189 Hurrah for General...what's his name?
4655356 4656357 Lee!
4659444 4662905 God is with us<br />because He hates the Yanks, too!
4664657 4668453 God is not on our side<br />"cause He hates idiots also.
4688306 4689890 Prisoners of war...
4690057 4691725 forward...
4692601 4693809 ...march!
4756580 4758874 Form a single file.
4818642 4820226 Robert Clark.
4820393 4821603 Present.
4822520 4823730 Sam Richmond.
4823897 4825105 Present.
4828233 4829693 Bill Carson.
4835991 4837993 | said Bill Carson!
4838785 4841705 Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?
4842206 4845459 All right, what's he doing? Sleeping?!
4848337 4851506 Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.
4854509 4855928 That's me!
4864228 4866396 Please, Carson.
4867564 4869316 Answer, "Present"!
4870943 4873111 What are you, deaf?
4878784 4881745 Now, suppose you say "present," Carson.
4883163 4885999 | like big fat men like you.
4886166 4888460 When they fall, they make more noise.
4888627 4891171 And sometimes they never get up.
4892089 4893965 Wallace...
4895465 4897217 ...that's enough.
4899844 4901680 Sergeant!
4903223 4906226 The captain wants to see you right away.
4909145 4911982 Be sure these two get good treatment.
4922075 4925704 Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?<br />Good treatment!
4932627 4935046 For the last time, sergeant...
4935213 4936214 .../'m telling you...
4936381 4939426 ...l want the prisoners<br />treated as prisoners.
4940176 4941970 No more brutality!
4943096 4946849 There's hundreds of prisoners out there<br />and only a few men to guard them.
4947016 4949225 What am | supposed to do?<br />| have to have respect!
4949392 4954188 | think that you'll manage to gain<br />their respect by treating them better!
4955564 4958108 Are our men treated that well<br />in Andersonville Camp?
4958275 4960944 I don't give a goddamn<br />what they do in Andersonville!
4961111 4963363 While I'm in charge here,<br />the prisoners are not to be...
4963530 4964573 tortured...
4964740 4966324 ...or cheated...
4966490 4968074 ...or murdered!
4968366 4970118 Is that an accusation?
4970285 4973580 Sergeant, gangrene is eating<br />my leg away...
4974372 4975956 ..not my eyes.
4976123 4979126 | know the prisoners here are being<br />robbed systematically.
4979293 4983005 | know there's scum around,<br />or bivouacked near the camp, waiting...
4983172 4986008 ...for someone to deliver this loot.
4986175 4989803 But as long as I'm commandant,<br />| won't permit any such trickery!
4989970 4991513 Am | clear?
4993307 4994599 Yes, sir.
4994766 4997894 Just as long as you're the commandant.
4998936 5000520 Yes, sergeant.
5003398 5006693 | know this leg means<br />| won't last very long...
5006860 5009613 ...but | pray | can manage<br />to have enough time...
5009780 5014743 ...to amass evidence and bring to a<br />court-martial all those who discredit...
5015452 5018037 ...and dishonor the uniform...
5018287 5019955 ...of the Union!
5024210 5025920 I wish you luck.
5060538 5063374 You and the others better lay low<br />for a few days.
5064666 5068294 I'll keep this. You go.<br />Wallace will let you know.
5080682 5083184 - Bring me Carson.<br />- Right.
5097699 5100702 Angel Eyes said for us<br />to lay low for a few days.
5101035 5104038 But we'll keep close enough<br />to keep an eye on things.
5104456 5106416 Come on, saddle your horses.
5117135 5118511 Come on in, Tuco.
5119262 5120762 Don't be bashful.
5121680 5123974 There's no formalities here.
5135235 5137237 It's been a long time!
5140866 5142074 You're hungry.
5143075 5144743 Sit down. Eat!
5164179 5165931 I knew it, | knew it!
5167766 5169935 The minute | saw you, | said to myself:
5171102 5173522 “Look at that pig, Angel Eyes..."
5174940 5177400 ",.[IL bet he's got himself<br />an easy job!"
5180737 5182739 “And he never forgets a friend!"
5183615 5185742 I never forget old friends, Tuco.
5189703 5191663 It's good to see old friends again.
5194958 5197627 Especially when they come<br />from so far away...
5198378 5200630 ...and have so much to talk about.
5202173 5205051 And you do have a lot to talk about,<br />haven't you?
5207636 5209304 You were captured near...
5209680 5210722 ...Fort Craig?
5215561 5218313 If you were with Sibley,<br />then you were...
5219231 5220941 ...coming from Santa Fe?
5233537 5235372 Was it hard crossing the desert?
5236248 5237291 Very hard!
5239167 5241752 Especially if you don't have<br />anything to drink.
5244463 5247383 Why are you going under the name<br />of Bill Carson, now?
5253097 5255349 One name is as good as another.
5255850 5257852 Not wise to use your own name.
5258853 5262273 Like you, | bet they don't call you<br />Angel Eyes.
5263357 5265233 Sergeant Angel Eyes.
5274284 5276536 Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?
5277412 5278413 Music?
5278997 5282042 Yes, very good for the digestion.
5297557 5299684 Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
5305732 5307275 That fake, too?
5309027 5311488 Bill Carson's name is written on it.
5313198 5314532 Have some.
5315367 5317410 It's Bill Carson's tobacco.
5401327 5404122 Was Carson dead or alive<br />when you found him?
5410587 5412714 What'd he tell you about the money?
5416760 5419012 I don't know what you're talking about!
5436988 5438782 More feeling.
5457050 5460345 You can sure consider yourself<br />much luckier than your pal.
5460804 5463681 Wallace will punch your friend<br />as long as the song goes.
5463848 5466559 So many of us have had a session in there.
5488122 5490124 How's your digestion now?
5494087 5495671 You'd better talk.
5495963 5498172 | have nothing to tell you!
5525700 5527326 Play that fiddle, you!
5571954 5574040 Ill talk!
5583925 5586134 What did he say about the money?
5591056 5592640 It's buried in a grave.
5593848 5594932 Where?
5597976 5599895 At the Sad Hill Cemetery.
5602189 5603941 Which grave?
5604232 5605776 I don't know!
5609737 5611029 Blondie...
5613990 5616534 ...he knows the name of the grave.
5633218 5634844 The war's over for you.
5638597 5640224 Put those clothes on.
5644687 5646105 Why?
5646647 5648607 We're going for a ride.
5649650 5650442 Where?
5650776 5653112 To find $200,000.
5654154 5656407 I know the name of the cemetery now...
5657241 5659618 ..and you know the name of the grave.
5679638 5682641 You're not going to give me<br />the same treatment?
5686394 5687729 Would you talk?
5689105 5691149 No, probably not.
5692733 5694359 That's what | thought.
5695277 5697069 Not that you are any tougher than Tuco...
5697528 5700573 ...but you're smart enough to know<br />that talking won't save you.
5704618 5707538 And Tuco, is he?
5709874 5711917 No, not yet...
5713209 5715169 ...but he's in very good hands.
5716712 5719673 You changed partners,<br />but you still got the same deal.
5720007 5722592 I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
5724010 5725344 There's two of us.
5725720 5728222 It should make it easier than just one.
5754165 5756374 Hold it. That's it.
5756917 5758043 Don't move.
5759044 5760504 Don't breathe.
5764216 5765926 Got it. Thank you.
5782067 5785444 Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?<br />Where's the Rebel going?
5785736 5788321 To hell with a rope around his neck<br />and a price on his head.
5788488 5790949 Yeah, $3,000, friend.
5791491 5793576 That's a lot of money for a head.
5794744 5797622 | bet they didn't even pay you<br />a penny for your arm.
5803961 5807047 I told you once,<br />but if lever get you down...
5807589 5810050 ...you're gonna need a lot of help<br />to get up again.
5830362 5832531 You're a lot luckier than that one there.
5832698 5835200 You get some proper rope,<br />and you're all finished.
5835367 5838328 And there isn't any partner, this time,<br />to shoot you down.
5862978 5864229 Get up!
5953110 5955612 Sure would like to put<br />your paw on it, huh?
5957906 5959866 | would like to piss, it's rough.
5960075 5962577 I've been shaken up in this train<br />nearly ten hours now.
5962744 5964788 You smell like a pig already!
5965580 5968083 Let's try not to make things any worse.
5970544 5971962 Get goin'
5981138 5983931 I can't while you're watching me.
6007163 6009956 You made a lot of noise my friend, huh?
6030852 6032771 You don't wanna break<br />our friendship, huh?
6032937 6034397 Well, I'll break it!
6176831 6178917 Clemens, take care of the horses.
6428833 6431461 I've been looking for you<br />for eight months!
6432503 6435381 Whenever | should have had<br />a gun in my right hand...
6435631 6436883 ...1 thought of you!
6437175 6440386 Now I find you in exactly<br />the position that suits me.
6441179 6445099 | had lots of time to learn<br />how to shoot with my left.
6460948 6463242 When you have to shoot, shoot!<br />Don't talk.
6467121 6469749 Every gun makes its own tune...
6470291 6472543 ..and it's perfect timing, large one.
6491020 6493272 Clem, follow him.
6550288 6552623 Just a minute. I'll be right there.
6553416 6556502 Just give me a little time to get dressed,<br />and I'll open up.
6577398 6580109 Put your drawers on,<br />and take your gun off.
6593247 6595958 How the hell did you get out<br />of that pigsty?
6597418 6601297 My own way.<br />I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.
6602381 6605259 You talked, you traitor! You talked!
6606218 6607886 No, | didn't talk.
6608428 6611097 If | did,<br />| probably wouldn't be here, now.
6615310 6617646 So, only you know your half of the secret?
6624903 6627155 I'm very happy you are working with me!
6627447 6628907 And we're together again.
6629407 6631701 I'll get dressed, | kill him,<br />and be right back.
6631868 6634453 Listen, I forgot to mention.
6637289 6639874 He's not alone. There's five of ‘em.
6642335 6644587 - Five?<br />- Yeah, five of ‘em.
6647882 6650134 So, that's why you came to Tuco.
6653721 6656306 It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all!
6668068 6670028 They shot him at close range.
6689755 6691465 Well, look who's here!
6692008 6693718 The other one will be along.
6696637 6698597 They'll come looking for us.
6700224 6701559 Watch out!
6702810 6704437 There's two of them.
6705813 6707982 | want that blond alive!
6716741 6719869 You back there. Come on, let's go!
6754195 6756363 Were you going to die alone?
6894710 6896212 Angel Eyes is mine.
6896670 6897922 All right.
6937586 6939505 “See you soon."
6942174 6943133 "Idiots."
6944969 6946220 It's for you.
6971245 6973414 How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
6974331 6976583 Like a cemetery, for instance?
6978085 6980379 There should be a bridge<br />across that river.
6981171 6982631 We better wait for nightfall.
6982798 6984425 Trust in me, Blondie.
6987761 6989596 I got a good sense of where I'm going.
6989763 6992641 Tuco has taken you this far,<br />| will take you all the way...
6998772 7000524 - Tell the captain.<br />- Yes, sir.
7001900 7004361 Come along now. Follow me.
7050991 7053452 We found them near the perimeter, sir.
7068008 7069843 Where do you hail from?
7070386 7071720 Illinois.
7074181 7075516 And you?
7076850 7077976 I'm with him.
7084233 7086235 Your reason for being around here?
7087361 7089822 We want to enlist, general!
7092825 7094993 You'd better learn to distinguish rank.
7095369 7096745 I'm a captain!
7098705 7100124 Get the hell out!
7102000 7105212 It sure as hell might be you today,<br />so go write your will.
7111593 7113553 So, you want to enlist.
7114720 7116889 You got to take a test to prove it.
7126441 7127941 Well, show me.
7151840 7156052 You've got a career.<br />At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel!
7156219 7157721 - Really?<br />- Sure!
7159055 7160765 Like it says in the manual.
7161266 7165520 You've got every qualification<br />to become expert in the use of weapons.
7166896 7170608 This is the most potent weapon in war!
7173861 7175988 The fighting spirit is in this bottle!
7178324 7179950 Volunteers...
7182036 7183996 You want to enlist?
7185288 7186372 Then let's go.
7191461 7193630 The shooting hasn't begun yet.
7194838 7198717 Yes, because soon you can join<br />the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.
7200761 7204138 - We have two attacks a day.<br />- Two attacks a day?
7204472 7205431 Sure.
7205598 7209519 The Reb's have decided that damn bridge<br />is the key to this whole area.
7211311 7213480 Stupid, useless bridge.
7214022 7216566 A flyspeck on headquarters’ maps.
7218401 7223031 And headquarters has declared that<br />we must take that ridiculous flyspeck...
7224783 7226618 ...even if all of us are killed.
7226993 7231081 Otherwise, the key'll get rusty<br />and just be a spot on the wall.
7232749 7234084 And that's not all.
7234751 7237128 Both sides want the bridge intact!
7237420 7241424 Intact is how the South wants it.<br />And we want it intact, too.
7244553 7248223 You'll all turn to dust,<br />but one thing is sure, boys...
7249140 7251977 ...Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.
7253353 7254437 Is it bad...
7254813 7257232 ...to speak the way | do to volunteers?
7258692 7260610 I've done a lot worse.
7265198 7267242 I've done it. I've blown it up...
7269827 7273080 ...In here. I've destroyed it all.
7273956 7277251 It's a court-martial offense to imagine--<br />to dream of blowing it up.
7277418 7279086 A serious crime.
7279461 7283173 Even to think of destroying<br />that bridge is just...
7286468 7288762 Why not really blow it up, captain?
7290306 7293726 Yeah, captain, it's nothing.<br />Let's scare the hell out of them!
7297146 7299273 I've been dreaming about it.
7302943 7304987 I've even worked out a plan.
7306614 7308157 | sure have!
7309241 7312036 The best time is after the attack...
7312536 7315289 ...when there's a truce<br />to get the wounded.
7316457 7317708 If | could do it...
7318626 7320669 ...l could save many thousands of men.
7326759 7328719 But what I lack is the guts.
7334892 7337811 They're beginning the daily slaughter,<br />right on time.
7338187 7340898 Captain! All companies<br />are awaiting your orders.
7341690 7343274 I'll be right there.
7359040 7360332 All right, friends...
7360957 7363126 ..come along and enjoy the spectacle.
7394574 7395617 Companies!
7396034 7397077 Report!
7397369 7399578 Company B, ready!
7436699 7440327 It looks like the captain is really asking<br />for a bullet in his guts!
7494131 7497426 I've never seen<br />so many men wasted so badly.
7518030 7521575 I've a feeling it's really gonna be<br />a good long battle.
7528040 7530417 The money is<br />on the other side of the river.
7532085 7533044 Where?
7535880 7538883 Amigo, | said on the other side.<br />That's enough.
7539967 7543011 But while the Confederates are there,<br />we can't get across.
7544721 7548725 What would happen<br />if somebody were to blow up that bridge?
7552354 7555065 Then these idiots would go<br />somewhere else to fight!
7555899 7557025 Maybe.
7595147 7597983 Doctor, quick! The captain's wounded!
7600444 7602236 Hurry, a stretcher!
7604613 7606281 Easy, now.
7617167 7618793 Get things ready.
7639814 7641316 A little of this will help.
7648239 7650158 Take a slug of this, captain...
7650700 7652702 ..and keep your ears open.
7701501 7702585 What're you doing?
7805313 7808191 You realize we might be risking our lives?
7809734 7813695 If | get killed, you'll never get<br />your hands on all that beautiful money.
7816907 7818826 It sure would be a pity.
7854653 7856780 Can you help me live a little more?
7857489 7859241 l expect good news.
7872546 7875382 Why don't we tell each other<br />our half of the secret?
7875883 7877843 Why don't we?
7879386 7880678 You go first.
7883014 7885516 No, | think it's better that...
7887977 7889312 ...you start.
7893566 7894567 All right.
7897360 7899737 The name of the cemetery is...
7917630 7919798 ...9ad Hill! Now it's your turn!
7928098 7929892 The name on the grave is...
7934605 7935940 ...Arch Stanton.
7938192 7939276 Arch Stanton?
7939985 7941320 Are you sure?
7942238 7943948 Sure, I'm sure.
8649736 8651780 It'd be a lot easier with that.
8692362 8694571 Two can dig a lot quicker than one.
8695239 8696323 Dig!
8699451 8701078 You're not digging?
8713340 8716051 If you shoot me,<br />you won't see a cent of that money.
8718846 8719722 Why?
8722850 8724226 Mil tell you why.
8725436 8727104 "Cause there's nothin' in there.
8737531 8739283 You thought I'd trust you?
8742536 8744913 $200,000 is a lot of money.
8746581 8748332 We're gonna have to earn it.
8752085 8752794 How?

8771354 8772314 The gun?
9139097 9143184 You pig! You wanted to get me killed?<br />When'd you unload it?
9145270 9146396 Last night.
9147730 9151275 You see, in this world there's two kinds<br />of people, my friend...
9152443 9156071 ...those with loaded guns,<br />and those who dig.

9358521 9360774 ..seems just like old times.
9365111 9366613 Four for you...
9373370 9374621 ...and four for me.
9417455 9418747 Sorry, Tuco.
9575362 9577364 Hey, Blondie...
