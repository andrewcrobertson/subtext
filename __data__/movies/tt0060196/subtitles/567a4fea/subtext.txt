639158 641661 Baker sent you?
651211 653709 Tell Baker I already told him<br />everything I know!
653781 655908 Tell him I want to live in peace,<br />understand?
655991 658515 That it's useless for him<br />to continue to torment me!
658594 661338 I don’t know anything<br />about that damn case of dollars!
661413 665935 I kept my end of the bargain, and if<br />he'd listened to me, today that case...
666769 668789 Well, it's gone.
668813 672715 There was an investigation.<br />But nothing came of it.
672716 675740 I know exactly what Baker knows.
675819 678842 That's all you can tell him.
680199 683268 Someone came to see you...
684161 686759 ... and Baker knows it.
688040 691058 A certain Jackson.
693212 695135 So...
695214 698232 ... Jackson was here...
698701 701754 Or is Baker wrong?
708778 710778 He's not wrong.
711130 715227 Baker would like to know<br />what you and this Jackson said...
715768 719362 ... about that cash box.
721949 724977 But I didn't come for that.
725369 728522 That's not what they pay me for.
728580 732660 I want to know what Jackson<br />calls himself now.
735754 737928 Why do you say he changed his name?
737952 741018 I would have already found him.
741519 744964 When I look for someone,<br />I always find them.
745039 748107 That's why they pay me.
750871 755119 And... how much does Baker pay you?
758110 760678 Your family?
769621 771138 Yes.
771762 773762 Nice family.
775878 778976 How much does he give you to kill me?
781383 783777 Five hundred dollars...
783801 786301 For that name.
791894 794396 The name.
802988 806082 Carson. Bill Carson.
806208 809231 That's what he calls himself now.
836755 838255 Here.
839358 842886 It's a thousand. For you.
846198 848771 A thousand dollars.
850452 855006 And half in gold. A tidy sum.
858293 862569 But he paid too,<br />and I have my own rule.
862573 866393 When someone pays me<br />I always get the job done.
935579 937722 Is that you?
937746 939792 Did he talk?
941293 943315 Too much.
944338 949366 He said some things that interest you,<br />and others that interest me.
949885 951907 And that is?
952304 957325 The name Jackson's hiding under<br />is Bill Carson.
958977 961545 That's for you.
962869 964916 And then what?
965317 969488 And then he talked about a certain case,<br />which disappeared...
969489 971906 ... and was full of dollars.
971907 973911 This interests me.
973935 975977 What else?
976578 979101 You don't think that's enough?
979164 983685 But don't worry.<br />He won't say anything to anyone again.
984060 986138 Good.
989174 995229 Here you go,<br />this is your five hundred dollars.
997857 1000580 Yeah, I forgot...
1000604 1002954 He gave me a thousand.
1002955 1006499 You know he wanted me to kill you.
1013031 1018504 The trouble is that when someone pays me,<br />I always get the job done.
1018578 1020583 And you should know that.
1020607 1024107 No! Sentenza! No!
1067294 1068911 Hold it, friend!
1069004 1073099 You better not. There are three of us.
1088041 1089713 Hey, you!
1089714 1096236 Did you know that your face looks like that<br />of someone worth two thousand dollars?
1096760 1098760 Yeah...
1099993 1104522 But you don't look like the one<br />who will collect it.
1112130 1115198 A few steps back.
1167352 1169370 Well, thank you.
1177279 1180003 How much are you worth now?
1180027 1182783 Well, you know, don't you?
1182807 1185396 Two thousand dollars.
1186997 1189725 Exactly. Two thousand dollars.
1189749 1191749 Not bad.
1197949 1200349 <i>¡Y la puta que te parió!</i>
1200427 1204802 You'll pay for it!<br />I want to see you drop dead!
1204806 1207730 Of cholera, of rabies, of blackpox!
1207809 1211988 Untie me! Untie me, you son of a mangy dog!
1212012 1213080 Pull me down!
1213081 1216861 Look, you still have time.<br />If you let me go, I'll forgive you.
1216862 1221961 Otherwise, I want to see you<br />with worms in your eyes!
1222685 1224325 I feel sick.
1224326 1226795 Get me out of here,<br />I can't take it anymore.
1226819 1229907 The blood went to my head.
1231208 1233751 God, God... Blond...
1234753 1236326 Water!
1242552 1245772 Coward! Son of a bitch!
1245847 1247841 You know how to mess with someone tied up!
1247842 1249964 Untie me if you dare!
1249965 1251477 Are you leaving?
1251478 1253899 You're afraid! Come here!
1253923 1255474 You rat!
1256775 1257829 And who is this?
1257853 1260770 One cuckold goes away<br />and another arrives. Another!
1260771 1262994 Stop it! Stop it!
1263073 1264618 Get out of here!
1268912 1270542 Look here!
1270566 1273123 Do you recognise this face?
1273124 1274802 It's yours!
1274803 1278712 Mine? And who says it's mine?
1278713 1280607 You, roll it up, roll it up.
1280682 1282750 Then I'll tell you<br />where you have to put it.
1282826 1286829 Damn the sheriffs and those who made them!
1286922 1289022 Hey, there, he gives him the money now.
1289046 1290599 Judas!
1290600 1292151 You sold my skin.
1292175 1294445 But you won't enjoy it, you know?
1294446 1299465 You won't enjoy it because if there's a bit<br />of justice in this world, they'll end up in medicines.
1299531 1303255 All, every last cent, all!
1303338 1305736 Because you're a bastard!
1305760 1308460 You don't know it, but I do.
1308461 1312335 Everyone knows you're the son<br />of a thousand fathers, all bastards like you!
1312336 1314832 And your mother,<br />if you want to know, was a...
1314833 1316881 You're a bastard!
1316882 1319871 You send a poor man to the gallows!
1319895 1321939 Who didn’t hurt anyone!
1322340 1326541 Already wanted in fourteen counties<br />of this state...
1326542 1329685 ... is found guilty of the crimes<br />of murder...
1329686 1335463 ... armed robbery against private individuals,<br />banks and state postal services...

1359744 1364788 ... magistrates and public officials of county,<br />district and state...
1364789 1369545 ... therefore, according to the faculties granted to us,<br />we condemn the hereby present:
1369554 1372574 ... Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramìrez...
1372575 1373937 Known as 'The Pig'...
1373961 1377519 ... to death by hanging.
1377520 1381400 May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
1381401 1383421 Proceed.
1408226 1410630 Here you go, five to you.
1410713 1415237 One, two, three, four and five to me.
1416768 1418796 Five more to you...
1418820 1421889 ... and five more to me.
1422190 1423863 Do you know how much you're worth now?
1423942 1427967 - No. How much am I worth?<br />- Three thousand dollars.
1431491 1434290 The world is divided in two, my friend.
1434369 1438294 Those who have the rope around their neck,<br />and those who cut it.
1438373 1441718 Except that the neck<br />inside the rope is mine.
1441742 1444094 I'm the one taking the risk.
1444095 1447814 So next time I want more than half.
1447882 1452957 Yes, it's true that you take the risk,<br />but I cut.
1453480 1457949 And... if you lower my percentage...
1457976 1459993 Cigar?
1460979 1464023 Well, I might miss my aim.
1465942 1469822 But if you miss, you must really miss.
1469904 1473659 Because whoever cheats me<br />and then doesn't kill me...
1473742 1477870 It means that he hasn't understood<br />anything about Tuco.
1477912 1479980 Nothing!
1483042 1487798 Already wanted in fifteen counties of this state,<br />the hereby present:
1487799 1491222 ... Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramìrez...
1491223 1496214 ... is found guilty by this court<br />of the following crimes:
1496264 1498187 Armed robbery...
1498188 1501687 ... rape of a virgin girl<br />of the white race...
1501770 1506419 ... derailment of a train<br />for the purpose of robbery...
1506443 1510787 ... escape from four state prisons<br />with the wounding of seven guards...
1510788 1515285 ... illicit trafficking of weapons<br />and explosives owned by the army...
1515366 1518996 - So, what have you heard?<br />- Well, it seems like a novel.
1519078 1524799 A unit escorting a case of gold dollars<br />is destroyed by Northerners in an ambush.
1524874 1528523 Only three are saved:<br />Stevens, Baker and Jackson.
1528597 1530791 But what isn't saved<br />is the case of dollars.
1530815 1533639 They do an investigation,<br />and Jackson is acquitted.
1533640 1537727 But lo and behold, after a while<br />he disappears and becomes Bill Carson.
1537769 1539816 Yes, I already know that.
1539891 1543340 What I know is that I've figured out<br />why you're looking for him.
1543419 1546424 And I wouldn't want to be in his shoes.
1549025 1550026 Where's Carson?
1550109 1553263 I know he came back to enlist<br />and lost an eye in battle.
1553346 1555777 There's a certain Maria<br />who can tell you more.
1555778 1558100 She's a whore who's with him.
1558101 1560750 - Where can I find him?<br />- Yeah, what's the name of that place?
1560829 1563881 Yet, it's an easy-to-remember name.
1565542 1567044 Santa Ana.
1570088 1573182 Farewell, half-soldier.
1577654 1578697 Whiskey!
1578972 1580599 ... passed off as a guide...
1580600 1583851 ... having collected the payment<br />for the entire journey in advance...
1583852 1588905 ... and having therefore abandoned the wagon train<br />in the hunting territory of the Apache Indians...
1590216 1593837 Poor devils.<br />What a terrible thing that must be.
1593912 1595755 A rope isn't enough for a hanging.
1595779 1598308 What do you mean?
1599709 1604713 That even a beggar like that<br />has his guardian angel.
1607166 1609964 ... granted by the laws of this state...
1609988 1613088 A blond angel who watches over him.
1613089 1618083 ... Juan Maria Ramìrez,<br />to death by hanging.
1618094 1622114 May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
1623224 1624746 Proceed.
1639574 1641652 Come on, Blond, get out!
1673650 1676744 But what do you mean,<br />anyone can miss a shot?
1676819 1680048 The shot isn't missed,<br />when I'm at the end of the rope.
1680073 1682292 And you, have you ever had<br />a rope around your neck?
1682293 1688310 I assure you that when it starts to tighten,<br />you already feel the devil biting your ass.
1689207 1694278 Yes, it's dangerous.<br />You're right, get down.
1694754 1700852 And then there's to consider that a chicken thief like you<br />will never be worth more than three thousand dollars.
1700927 1702144 What do you mean?
1702220 1706290 That with a man like you, frankly,<br />there is no future.
1707016 1708889 So?
1708913 1711988 So I dissolve the partnership.
1712689 1717063 No, no, I said the partnership.<br />You stay tied.
1717151 1719549 And the three thousand dollars<br />come with me.
1719550 1723966 Of all the filthiest, stinking filth,<br />that the filthiest...
1723967 1727953 The nearest town is seventy miles<br />from here.
1728037 1732190 If you save your breath,<br />someone like you can make it.
1732233 1733309 Sorry.
1733333 1736353 Coward! Judas! Cheating bastard!
1736754 1738380 Come here! Where are you going?
1738381 1741736 Get off your horse, if you're a man!<br />Get off your horse!
1741760 1746223 Come back! If I grab you,<br />I'll rip out your heart and eat it!
1746224 1750467 I'll skin you alive,<br />and hang you with your guts!
1750468 1753789 I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
1755565 1761069 So ungrateful, after all the times<br />I've saved your life.
1765450 1767118 Blond, what are you doing?
1767119 1770041 What, are you leaving? Wait!
1770060 1773158 Blond, listen... Wait!
1774542 1780569 <i>¡Hijo de una gran puta!</i>
1798858 1801327 The lady is here!
1801328 1806421 Get undressed tonight,<br />and give us 2nd Cavalry prices!
1815041 1817064 <i>¡Cabrones!</i>
1832725 1834742 Maria...
1841250 1843768 Is that you, Bill?
1844792 1846292 Bill?
1855706 1859526 Who are you? What do you want here?
1859544 1862988 Keep talking about Bill Carson.
1863047 1865620 I don't know him.
1866050 1869094 You don't know him<br />and you're calling to him in the dark?
1873015 1874541 Where is he?
1874565 1876653 What do you want to do to him?
1877854 1880907 I ask the questions.
1882108 1884151 Where did he go?
1890032 1891902 So where is he?
1891926 1896926 Where! Where! Where! Where!
1901127 1902695 That's enough!
1904130 1907630 I don't know where he is.<br />He left ten days ago.
1907708 1911008 With his unit. They all left.
1911012 1914065 What unit? Where was he going?
1917268 1920950 3rd Cavalry, General Sibley.
1920974 1923481 He went to Santa Fe.
1923482 1926080 I swear, that's all I know.
2018369 2021447 I'm sorry, but I'm closing.
2059201 2063295 - Guns.<br />- Guns...
2066584 2068711 Real guns!
2068735 2072235 Here, here are the best ones.
2077261 2080234 Remington, Colt...
2080264 2083638 ... Roat, Smith-Wesson...
2083642 2085989 ... Colt-Navy...
2086013 2087854 ... Joslyn...
2087855 2090302 ... another Remington, and this...
2090382 2092430 That's enough.
2134568 2136665 Cartridges.
2144829 2148831 - If you want to try it, out back.<br />- Walk.
2154004 2155577 Go.
2231123 2233200 Cartridges.
2241050 2245073 - How much?<br />- Fifteen dollars.
2246488 2247989 No.
2250893 2252895 Fifty dollars.
2254146 2256168 You say?
2256192 2258192 One hundred dollars.
2260819 2261996 Two hundred dollars.
2262020 2264520 It's all I have.
2264544 2266544 Here it is.
2285844 2287941 Come here.
2299541 2301567 Clear?
2317293 2319870 This morning I heard someone say<br />that Colonel Canby...
2319953 2323981 ... with his Colorado volunteers<br />is less than five miles from here.
2324425 2327098 That's why they're beating it.
2327761 2328986 Do you see?
2328987 2331792 These won't wage war anymore, rest assured.
2331793 2334492 - The will has gone.<br />- Poor people.
2334493 2336386 What poor people.
2336462 2340057 The sooner these starving people leave,<br />the sooner the Yankees arrive.
2340058 2345099 They don't pay in talk, my dear,<br />but in hard dollars.
2346855 2350205 Look, look at Sibley The one up there<br />on the wagon with the white beard.
2350206 2351745 It's General Sibley.
2351746 2353545 He's getting out of the way, finally.
2353546 2357637 Long live the Confederacy!<br />Long live the Confederacy! Long live...
2361587 2364606 Where is the owner of that horse?
2364632 2367932 - Please sir, lower that weapon.<br />- Where is he?
2368010 2370684 War is enough to make us die of fear.
2370763 2372907 I'm looking for a half-smoked cigar...
2372982 2377813 ... with the face of a tall, blond,<br />son of a bitch behind it, who doesn't talk much.
2377814 2381111 Here everyone doesn't talk much. What do you<br />want my husband to know of your dirty business?
2381190 2383718 Shut up, hen!
2385194 2389739 Upstairs. Room number 4.
2394286 2396308 Number 4.
2401085 2403588 You are a...
2598657 2600679 The spurs.
2615549 2618223 Spurs are divided into two categories...
2618302 2621481 Some come through the door...
2621505 2624073 ... and some through the window.
2624074 2626647 Throw away the gun.
2633609 2635631 It's unloaded.
2637779 2639801 Mine isn't.
2645871 2650926 Even Judas, when he hanged himself,<br />heard thunder.
2653128 2655631 These sound rather like cannon fire.
2655714 2659309 Cannon fire or thunder,<br />it's all the same to you.
2661637 2665140 Do you recognise this noose, Blond?
2673607 2676180 Pass it over that beam.
2678028 2679605 Up there.
2691041 2693639 Get on that.
2702928 2704580 Bravo, like that.
2704604 2707632 Fix the rope securely to the beam.
2707933 2711936 It has to hold the weight of a pig.
2716692 2719241 Put your neck in it.
2726868 2728836 Very good.
2728860 2731288 You comfortable with that?
2731289 2734963 Well, let's fix it right away.<br />I have a new method.
2735043 2738216 A little different than yours.
2738271 2743342 I don't shoot the rope.<br />I shoot the legs of the stool.
2746766 2748766 <i>¡Adiós!</i>
2938580 2940127 Welcome, friend.
2940207 2943882 If you're looking for a vacation spot,<br />well, then you've found it.
2943960 2948009 Luxurious hotel full of comforts.
2949424 2951597 And the attractions don't end here.
2951676 2955852 International cuisine.<br />Healthy and nutritious food.
2955931 2960799 Southern-style corn cob.<br />Provided without frugality by our government.
2960894 2963568 As you can see, they treat us well.
2963647 2967072 Have you ever heard<br />of a certain Bill Carson?
2967150 2972532 And you, have you ever heard<br />of a certain Canby? No?
2972614 2976790 He's a Northern colonel who decided<br />to tear us all to pieces.
2976868 2982872 The only thing we're interested in is saving<br />our skin, and you ask me if I know a guy.
2983291 2988386 I don't know what's in your head,<br />the rest of you draft-dodgers.
2998223 3003302 Carson has an eye patch,<br />and he's with the 3rd.
3003979 3008179 If he's with the 3rd, they're gone.
3008233 3009860 To Glorieta.
3009943 3014073 They had Canby's vanguard<br />hot on their heels, poor wretches.
3014155 3016702 And the desert ahead.
3016726 3020261 It’s hard for me<br />to believe they’re still alive.
3020662 3023756 And what if they're still alive?
3025250 3027302 Worse.
3027377 3031152 Clearly you don't know<br />the Northern camp at Betterville.
3031231 3036958 It's a prison camp, and you'd better hope<br />you never end up inside it.
3037053 3039651 Keep it, it's yours.
3184051 3188722 We have judged the hereby present:<br />Thomas Larson, known as Shorty...
3188746 3190906 ... guilty of the following crimes:
3190907 3195212 Horse theft, theft of material<br />owned by the army...
3195295 3199574 ... theft of postal material,<br />wounding of two vigilantes...
3199616 3203186 ... armed threat<br />against citizen Barry O'Keefe...
3203261 3206908 ... false testimony,<br />escape from a state prison...
3206975 3209893 ... blackmail, robbery, affray,<br />murder and rape.
3209894 3212853 And Shorty?
3212854 3217030 Therefore, according to the faculties<br />granted to us by the laws of this state...
3217108 3219427 - No.<br />- No?
3219502 3221954 ... we condemn the named Thomas Larson,<br />known as Shorty...
3221997 3224366 ... to death by hanging.
3224367 3227866 May the Lord have mercy on his soul.
3227890 3229390 Proceed.
3235452 3237979 Sorry, Shorty.
3239005 3241032 Hey, walk!
3265031 3269080 For me, the desert,<br />immediately makes me thirsty.
3269410 3270562 Beat?
3270586 3275586 They say that the sun<br />isn't good for blond skin.
3298648 3302176 Here, so you're lighter?
3303278 3305656 Where are we going?
3305657 3309158 Where? Where only I will go.
3309759 3311360 Do you see how much beautiful sand?
3311361 3316041 Well, that's the desert,<br />an oven one hundred and fifty miles long.
3316124 3318502 Even the war is afraid to pass through it.
3318585 3324183 The Confederates are fleeing from that side.<br />From here come the Northerners.
3324257 3328081 But no one sets foot here.
3328105 3332105 Only you, with me.
3332123 3336167 Beautiful as a walk, don't you think?
3338229 3342278 Like you told me that time?
3342817 3347888 "If you save your breath,<br />a guy like you can make it."
3348990 3354036 If, on the other hand,<br />he doesn't make it, he dies.
3354312 3358866 But slowly, very slowly.
3362790 3364790 Come.
3481889 3484257 Are you taking a rest already?
3484333 3490082 Come on, let's go, we're almost there.<br />Only one hundred and twenty miles to go.
3490131 3493935 And no more than eight hours to sundown,<br />my friend.
3493968 3497011 If you will be able to see it.
3497388 3499481 Walk.
3609885 3612763 Well, now let's eat.
3612787 3615816 I mean, I'll eat.
3617717 3620761 While you... sunbathe.
3628769 3630795 Do you want water?
3635985 3638058 Drink, drink.
3644076 3645668 Go on.
3757932 3760610 Well, Blond...
3760634 3762634 Farewell.
3825734 3827234 Hold up!
3977434 3979434 Water...
3980996 3985997 Water... Water...
3990047 3994577 I'll pay you in dollars.<br />Two hundred thousand.
3998347 4001170 What did you say?
4001194 4003142 Who the hell are you?
4003143 4004840 Carson.
4004841 4008339 My name is Bill Carson now.
4008340 4011442 They surprised us from behind.
4011527 4012777 Water...
4012801 4016755 - My name is Jackson, not Carson.<br />- Carson, Carson, sure.
4016756 4019054 Yes, pleased to meet you.<br />I'm Lincoln's uncle.
4019133 4021788 But let's go back<br />to the subject of dollars...
4021870 4024968 Two hundred thousand...
4025249 4028001 Cash reserve of the 4th.
4028025 4032560 Baker has nothing to do with it.<br />I've, I've...
4032561 4036009 ... I've hidden it.
4036010 4038078 Where? Where, here?
4038102 4039937 Here?
4039938 4043432 - Talk!<br />- In the cemetery.
4043475 4044919 Which cemetery?
4044943 4049480 That one... of Sad Hill.
4049481 4051679 In the grave...
4051680 4053192 Which grave?
4053193 4055616 Is there a name? Is there a number?
4055696 4059742 Talk, talk, is there a number?<br />Talk, you filthy rat!
4059742 4064522 There's... There's a grave. There's a name.
4064538 4067540 - It's written...<br />- It's written?
4069764 4072264 Water...
4073589 4076132 Water...
4077885 4080809 You have to talk first<br />and then I'll give you water.
4080888 4083892 Sad Hill cemetery, and that's fine.<br />The grave, and that's fine.
4083974 4086443 But is there a name on this grave?<br />Tell me!
4086518 4090537 If not, how do I find it,<br />in the middle of a thousand others?
4093650 4097951 Don't die. Don't give me this shit!
4098030 4101275 Don't move. Hold on, the water is coming.
4101350 4104378 Wait to die, you filthy rat...
4125602 4127602 Get away!
4129520 4133043 Get out! Get out of there!
4136860 4140959 - He's dead!<br />- Yes.
4141448 4144001 I'll kill you!
4145454 4151449 I... I wouldn't do it, if I were you.
4151466 4154670 If you kill me now, you'll stay...
4154753 4159054 ... stay the beggar you are<br />for the rest of your life.
4159133 4161787 And what did he tell you?
4161811 4167071 He said... a name. Over a grave.
4167100 4169100 And what name?
4182698 4185702 Blond, what, are you dying?
4185726 4188161 Don't die I'm your friend, right?
4188162 4191837 And don't die now. Don't die.<br />It's true you won't die. Hey, Blond!
4191838 4195076 Come, come. How do you feel?
4195077 4199099 Do you want anything? I'll give you water,<br />don't die. Wait for it.
4199173 4202427 There it is, there it is.<br />Don't do me like that pig.
4202509 4206434 Here, here, take it. Water.<br />Take it, come on.
4206513 4208636 No, no, don't swallow, it'll hurt.
4208637 4210349 Easy, easy.
4210350 4215420 Come on, Blond, don't die.<br />At least wait a while.
4223489 4226938 - Hey, you open up, quick!<br />- Calm down, calm down.
4226962 4228016 Who goes there?
4228017 4230328 What do you mean 'who goes there'?<br />Who do you want it to be, the enemy?
4230329 4234375 If I was a Northerner<br />you wouldn't have time to ask me.
4242966 4246118 - Sergeant, check out that corporal.<br />- Yes, sir.
4246142 4250213 Sergeant, I have a seriously wounded man here,<br />if he's not already dead.
4253644 4257223 - He's still alive?<br />- It seems so.
4258182 4260009 - What happened?<br />- An ambush.
4260033 4264091 - Just the two of us got away.<br />- Name and travelling papers.
4266198 4267703 Here. Corporal Bill Carson.
4267727 4270484 3rd Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Troop...
4270508 4273508 ... we came from San Rafael.<br />Good enough for you?
4275249 4278251 Sergeant, as you read, this one croaks.
4278652 4281462 Where can I find the nearest infirmary?
4281463 4285209 But Corporal, we're retreating here<br />and you're looking for the infirmary?
4285284 4289659 If you want one, you'll have<br />to get taken prisoner by the Yankees.
4289680 4294575 - Where are we here?<br />- We're close to Apache Canyon.
4294601 4297150 - Apache Canyon?<br />- Apache Canyon.
4297229 4299652 Isn't there the mission of San Antonio<br />around here?
4299731 4302109 Sure, eighteen miles south, get him there.
4302192 4305787 The friars treat any wound,<br />regardless of the colour of the uniform.
4305862 4308741 And keep your eyes peeled,<br />it's full of Northerners around here.
4308824 4312371 - Thank you. Goodbye, Sergeant.<br />- Goodbye.
4335475 4336571 Hello, Friar!
4336595 4339395 - I have a very sick man here.<br />- But we have no more rooms.
4339396 4341414 Well, you'll give him yours.
4346987 4349306 - Where's Pablo Ramìrez?<br />- Father Ramìrez.
4349381 4353558 He's not at the friary now.<br />But she should be back any day now.
4353602 4358082 Well, it doesn't matter.<br />Now, let's get my friend better.
4358165 4359917 And may God be praised.
4360000 4365053 Because if you don't know, God is with us,<br />because he hates Yankees too, hey, Blond?
4365672 4368821 Blond! Friar, do you think<br />he's still breathing?
4368822 4371921 - Yes, yes.<br />- You're heavy...
4383774 4385791 Down there.
4414846 4417869 Here, redo the bandage.
4418693 4421335 This is my cell.
4421336 4422913 Easy.
4425774 4428478 - Out you. Out, out.<br />- But, Father.
4428502 4431559 He's like a brother to me.
4436527 4439550 So... So, Father...
4451007 4454526 Father, he's talking? Did he say anything?
4484791 4487044 Father, he asked for me?<br />Did he say something?
4487127 4490222 No, he's not talking for now.<br />But don't worry.
4490297 4494302 He's a very robust boy. And the fact<br />that he's still alive proves it.
4494384 4496853 I'm sure he'll be fine<br />in a couple of weeks.
4496928 4499477 Thank you Father, you don't know<br />how much that boy is worth to me.
4499556 4503150 <i>Viva</i> Jesus. <i>Viva</i> Saint Francis.
4551024 4553567 Blond...
4559157 4561658 Blond!
4579353 4583808 You know, that good friar told me<br />that in a few days you'll be healed.
4583890 4587645 It went really well for you, yesterday with me,<br />when it happened to you.
4587727 4590776 Imagine if you were alone.
4591481 4596830 Well, in short, I mean that,<br />when one is sick...
4596903 4602197 ... we need someone close to us,<br />a friend, a relative...
4602267 4606744 Do you have any relatives, Blond?
4606768 4609081 A mother?
4609082 4611200 Not even a mother.
4611201 4613202 Nobody?
4613503 4617002 You're just alone. Like me, Blond.
4617007 4619851 We're alone, the two of us.
4619875 4623405 I have you and you have me.
4624806 4627358 Not for long, though.
4627382 4629902 What a dirty fate!
4630503 4636523 Just now that we were about to get our hands<br />on all those dollars there, Blond.
4642240 4644584 I need to tell you the truth.
4644659 4648703 In my place you would do as I do.
4649456 4652329 It's over for you, Blond.
4652375 4656428 Not even a miracle can save you.
4657531 4663102 Damn it, it's my fault,<br />mine, mine, all mine!
4674189 4676362 Can I tell you one thing though?
4676363 4679837 If I knew that my last hour had come...
4679919 4683919 ... I swear to you, in short,<br />if I were in your place...
4683990 4687415 I'd say where the dollars are.<br />I would say it, really.
4687494 4689917 I would say that name written on the grave.
4689996 4692670 After all, when you're dead,<br />what do you do with money?
4692749 4698004 I know the name of the cemetery,<br />but who knows how many graves there will be.
4698004 4701883 I don't... Blond...
4701930 4704529 You want some coffee?
4705753 4707780 Come, come, drink.
4707781 4711660 And tell me. Tell me that name.
4711661 4713757 And I swear to you...
4713781 4718844 ... that as soon as I get my hands<br />on those two hundred thousand dollars...
4718845 4721774 ... I'll honour your memory.
4721845 4727870 Look, I swear to you.<br />I'll say one mass a day. Sung...
4728376 4732395 Come closer...
4735508 4737601 Tell me!
4738461 4740730 Cowardly bastard!
4740754 4742014 I will...
4742015 4745591 I... I will sleep peacefully...
4745615 4750515 ... because I know that my worst enemy...
4750563 4753563 ... watches over me.
4762027 4765327 'Tuco, water'. Here's the water.<br />I'll bring you water.
4765328 4769421 But if I can rip that name out of you,<br />I'll give you water.
4774080 4777575 Come on, the party's over.<br />Get your ass out of there.
4777584 4781286 I've already harnessed the horses.<br />We must leave now.
4781342 4786381 The wounded arrive by the cartload,<br />and if we don't split, we'll end up waging war too.
4786468 4790597 - Mr. Tuco, Father Ramìrez is back.<br />- Yes.
4790638 4794733 I'll deal with a private matter,<br />you meanwhile get ready, and make it quick.
4794934 4797977 - Where, over here?<br />- Yes.
4813801 4815801 Hey, Pablo!
4823171 4826173 Don't you recognise me?
4826174 4829676 It's me, Tuco.
4829700 4832200 Let me hug you.
4834974 4839048 You know, I just don't know<br />how it's done with friars.
4842273 4847371 I was passing by here, so I said to myself:<br />"I wonder if my brother remembers me."
4851074 4853576 And did I do wrong?
4854119 4856542 Well, it's all the same. I'm happy.
4856621 4859689 Now you've seen me.
4860834 4864908 Yes, well, I'm glad to have seen you.
4869359 4871757 My uniform?
4871781 4873637 It's a long story.
4873638 4877269 But let's talk about you,<br />which is more important.
4877293 4879518 You're looking very well.
4879519 4883342 A bit thin, perhaps, but...
4883398 4887442 ... still smart, Pablito?
4887862 4891935 How are our elders?
4892824 4898325 Only now do you remember them.<br />After nine years.
4900290 4902813 Nine years?
4903637 4907647 Well, nine years. Nine years!
4908548 4912642 Our father has been gone for a long time.
4912660 4916138 And our mother died a few days ago.
4916139 4919237 That's why I was away.
4919934 4925029 She asked for you a lot,<br />but there was only me.
4931529 4933577 And you?
4933656 4938080 Besides doing evil, what have you done?
4938161 4942255 Didn't you have a wife somewhere?
4944167 4946035 Not one. Many wives.
4946059 4950088 One here, one there.<br />From all over the place.
4950089 4954158 Come on brother,<br />why don't you preach to me?
4954636 4957704 What's the use?
4958139 4963210 Be on your way, Tuco. Go away.
4963234 4965744 - And may the Lord have mercy on you.<br />- Sure, I'm leaving.
4965842 4968774 But waiting for the Lord to remember me...
4968775 4971995 ... me, Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramìrez...
4972070 4974668 I want to tell you something...
4974692 4976615 You think you're better than me.
4976616 4981744 But from our parts, if one does not want to die of hunger,<br />either he becomes a priest, or a bandit.
4981829 4984378 You chose your path, I chose mine.
4984457 4986709 Mine is the hardest.
4986733 4988636 You talk about father and mother.
4988637 4991598 But when you left to be a friar I stayed.
4991673 4995553 I was ten, twelve and there was work to do,<br />and I did it.
4995635 5000186 I knew it was useless.<br />And now you know what I'll tell you?
5000265 5005317 You only became a friar because<br />you're too cowardly to do what I do.
5023162 5025234 Tuco...
5035508 5037576 Forgive me, brother.
5048800 5050300 Go.
5067123 5069675 What a meal.
5070668 5073137 He's a nice guy, my brother.
5073212 5076457 Yes, because I didn't tell you,<br />but the boss here is my brother.
5076458 5079568 In short, in Rome there's the Pope,<br />and here, there's my brother.
5079569 5081433 Every time he sees me he tells me:
5081512 5085233 "Stay, there's never a shortage<br />of food here."
5085308 5089714 In fact, do you know what he said to me?<br />"Invite that friend of yours too."
5089796 5095223 He's always the same, when he sees me<br />he never wants to let me go. Never.
5095476 5099571 He loves me, my brother.
5101240 5106261 Sure, even for someone like me,<br />it's a great thing to know that...
5106337 5112913 ... rain or wind, somewhere there's a bowl<br />of hot soup waiting for you.
5113127 5115153 Sure.
5115947 5120997 But hold this smoke.<br />It will help you digest.
5170476 5173525 Here it is. Here's the Sierra Magdalena.
5173563 5176912 Going this way, you cross the Rio Grande.
5176983 5180606 <i>Amigo,</i> it sure is a long way.
5180653 5184323 Here, northeast through all of Texas...
5184347 5188489 - And this way, then...<br />- Then?
5188536 5193090 Then when we get there I'll tell you,<br />so you don't worry.
5195418 5199172 These too no longer have any worries now.
5199255 5201223 But as I'm still alive...
5201224 5204640 ... and since we'll pass the Northern<br />and Confederate lines more than once...
5204641 5211087 ... maybe you should tell me<br />where we're going, right?
5211184 5216234 Towards two hundred thousand dollars.<br />Isn't that enough for you?
5224130 5229227 Hey! Hey! Hey!
5234207 5236085 Hey, wake up, Blond!
5236109 5240666 - There are soldiers. Come on!<br />- Blue or grey?
5243810 5247786 Hey! Hey, they're grey, like us.<br />Confederates.
5247810 5250830 We'll salute them, and go straight on.
5251131 5254311 Long live the Confederacy!
5254393 5257793 Long live the South!<br />Death to the Northerners!
5257817 5260571 - Long live General... What's his name?<br />- Lee.
5260572 5262667 General Lee!
5263653 5268673 God is with us,<br />because he hates the Yankees too!
5268866 5272370 No, God is not with us,<br />because he also hates imbeciles.
5284423 5289497 Up, two! Up, two! Up, two! Up, two!
5292598 5296643 Platoon, forward!
5296852 5298945 March!
5299469 5304469 Up, two! Up, two! Up, two! Up, two!
5350289 5352857 Platoon, halt!
5356037 5359110 Left face... Left!
5362293 5365816 Form a single file! Quick!
5406128 5409181 - Jonathan Ross!<br />- Present!
5411676 5414699 - Gregory Mills!<br />- Present!
5416681 5419560 - Richard McGilley!<br />- Present!
5419561 5422652 - Nathaniel Sullivan!<br />- Present!
5422770 5425774 - Robert Clark!<br />- Present!
5426565 5429638 - Sam Richmond!<br />- Present!
5432530 5434557 Bill Carson!
5437618 5439640 Bill Carson!
5440162 5442281 I said Bill Carson!
5442356 5446330 Hey, Blond, isn't that Sentenza?
5446419 5450213 So, are you having fun, Bill Carson?
5450214 5452432 Bill Carson!
5452466 5455640 Yes, and you're Bill Carson.
5455720 5458618 Bill Carson!
5458642 5461142 Yes, it's me.
5468482 5474530 You see, Bill Carson, here,<br />the answer is 'present'.
5475139 5477162 Didn't you hear?
5483038 5485562 Answer 'present'.
5487376 5490550 I like big fat guys like you.
5490629 5495706 Because when they fall,<br />they make a lot of noise.
5496385 5498907 Wallace...
5499538 5502040 That's enough.
5503559 5505635 Sergeant!
5507480 5510549 The captain wants you right away.
5513486 5516539 Treat them well, these two.
5526165 5530735 Hey, Blond, did you hear what he said?<br />Treat them well.
5532338 5534406 Yeah.
5537009 5540677 For the last time, Sergeant...
5540721 5544345 I repeat that I want prisoners<br />to be treated as prisoners.
5544433 5546476 Enough with the ill-treatment.
5546560 5550940 There are hundreds of those bastards<br />out there and I only have a few men.
5551023 5553446 How do you think I can get respect?
5553526 5559602 You would do this more easily<br />by behaving like a human being.
5559698 5562326 Why, are our people treated better<br />in Andersonville?
5562409 5565253 I don't give a shit<br />what the Southern camps do.
5565329 5572229 In my camp I don't want prisoners<br />to be tortured, robbed and murdered.
5572307 5574556 Would that be an accusation?
5574630 5580332 Sergeant, gangrene is eating away<br />at my leg but not my eyes.
5580427 5585647 I know that prisoners are regularly stripped<br />of all their personal possessions.
5585722 5590322 And I know that filthy individuals are bivouacking<br />around the camp ready to buy the stolen goods.
5590396 5594202 But as long as I'm the commandant,<br />I won't allow these things.
5594226 5596810 Am I clear?
5597611 5599204 Sure.
5599280 5602378 As long as you're the commandant.
5603409 5605431 Yes...
5607705 5611050 Yes, I know I'm dying, Sergeant.
5611125 5615776 But I hope to live as long as necessary...
5615854 5618007 ... to gather sufficient evidence...
5618090 5624684 ... to send to court-martial those who dishonour<br />the uniform of the Union.
5628601 5631669 I wish you success.
5665137 5669211 You and the others better get<br />a change of scenery for a while.
5669308 5670933 Not that one.
5670957 5673957 Wallace will notify you.
5683697 5684969 Wallace...
5684993 5687993 Bring Carson here.
5701465 5705090 Sentenza said we have to clear out.
5705169 5707794 Without straying too far, naturally.
5707818 5710824 Come on, let's get the horses ready.
5711125 5712693 Walk!
5721276 5723646 Come on.
5723670 5725730 Come on in, Tuco.
5726131 5729225 Feel free.
5739545 5742073 How long?
5745217 5747662 Are you hungry?
5747686 5750186 Sit down, eat.
5770117 5772185 I knew it!
5772244 5775239 From the moment I saw you<br />I said to myself...
5775240 5778904 ... look at that pig Sentenza...
5778928 5781928 ... how well he set himself.
5783839 5787293 And he doesn't forget his friends.
5787326 5791405 Of course I don't forget my friends, Tuco.
5792665 5793785 Bravo.
5793809 5797143 And I'm pleased to see them again,<br />every now and then.
5797144 5799238 Right.
5799313 5805366 Especially when they come from so far away<br />and have so many things to tell you.
5806612 5810691 And you have things to tell me?
5811517 5816521 You were taken at... Fort Craig.
5819708 5823578 So, if you were with Sibley,<br />it means that...
5823602 5826602 ... you were coming from Santa Fe.
5838268 5843417 - Bad desert?<br />- So bad.
5843440 5847019 Especially if he doesn't<br />have anything to drink.
5848862 5852832 How is it that your name<br />is Bill Carson now?
5856746 5859874 Well, it's as good a name<br />as any other, isn't it?
5859898 5862917 Mine is best not to carry around.
5863001 5867471 But then you too.<br />You don't call yourself Sentenza.
5867506 5870604 Sergeant Sentenza!
5872136 5874183 It would be nice.
5879601 5881729 Say, Tuco. Do you like music?
5881730 5883233 Music?
5883257 5886757 Yes, I like it.<br />It's good for the digestion.
5899371 5901543 And so...
5901607 5905685 Bill Carson is a fake name.
5906628 5911659 Then, this is also fake.
5912593 5916672 It says Bill Carson inside.
5917222 5919752 A little tobacco?
5919776 5922276 Come on, help yourself.
5974363 5976131 Louder.
6017447 6021500 What did Carson tell you<br />when you found him?
6026732 6029500 What did he tell you about dollars?
6032714 6035787 I don't know what you're talking about.
6060158 6063201 How's your digestion going?
6066246 6071343 - You better talk.<br />- I have nothing to tell you.
6109831 6111928 It's not over.
6136233 6139628 I wouldn't want to be<br />in your friend's shoes, you know?
6139637 6142661 The louder the choir sings,<br />the harder Wallace beats.
6142662 6146184 Many have passed through there.
6170251 6172833 Enough! Enough!
6172857 6176857 I'll talk! I'll talk!
6179151 6182179 What did he tell you about those dollars?
6182262 6184544 That... That they're...
6184568 6188618 That they're hidden in a grave.
6189119 6190743 Where?
6190767 6191921 At Sad Hill...
6191945 6195960 At Sad Hill cemetery.
6197461 6199738 Which grave?
6199762 6203817 I don't know. I don't know.
6205218 6209118 The Blond. The Blond...
6209122 6216455 He knows the name that is written<br />on the grave.
6228742 6231265 For you the war is over.
6233872 6236919 Put those clothes on.
6240003 6244028 - Why?<br />- Because we're leaving now.
6244716 6249186 - Where?<br />- Towards two hundred thousand dollars of gold.
6249221 6255745 I know the name of a cemetery<br />and you know the name of a grave.
6274704 6278408 And you won't play music for me?
6281546 6283639 Would you talk?
6283863 6286900 I really don't think so.
6287801 6290303 I don't think so, too.
6290345 6292473 And not because you're tougher than Tuco.
6292556 6296451 You're just smarter.<br />Talking wouldn't save you.
6299646 6304176 So Tuco... you've already...
6305360 6308604 No. Not yet.
6308628 6311465 But he's in good hands.
6311866 6314393 You've changed partners<br />but you won't get a bad deal.
6314394 6318414 I'm not too greedy.<br />I know how to stick to deals.
6318940 6323410 And I know how to be satisfied.<br />I only want half.
6327841 6329893 Yeah.
6349154 6350749 Hold that.
6350773 6353841 Perfect, don't move.
6354242 6359218 Still, keep still. Don't breathe.
6359289 6362332 Hey presto! Thank you.
6377140 6380861 Hey, Corporal, are you afraid of losing this one?<br />Where are you taking him?
6380935 6383730 I'm taking him to the gallows.<br />He has a bounty on his head.
6383806 6389849 Yeah, three thousand dollars, <i>amigo.</i><br />That's a lot for one head.
6389903 6393757 And how much did they give you<br />for this arm?
6399038 6405342 I've already told you Corporal, when I throw<br />you down, you'll make a lot of noise.
6425438 6430357 You're luckier than that spy.<br />Rope, soap, and it's done.
6430361 6434380 And without the compadre<br />who shoots this time.
6458054 6460122 Come on, get in!
6536674 6543054 If your friends stay in the wet,<br />they'll catch a cold, or a bullet.
6547060 6550654 Hear that, boys? Come on out.
6561825 6566404 Since we're going the same path,<br />it's best to keep each other company.
6566454 6571310 One, two, three, four...
6571359 6574628 ... five, six.
6574629 6576608 Six...
6576632 6579091 Perfect number.
6579092 6582111 Isn't three the perfect number?
6583263 6587287 Yes, but I have six shots in here.
6649954 6653178 You'd like to grab it?
6653202 6657002 No. I'd like to piss.
6657003 6659506 I've been dancing in here for ten hours.
6659589 6662433 You smell bad enough already.
6662508 6665711 It's best not to make the situation worse.
6667348 6669441 Come on, move it!
6677815 6680864 No. If you look at me, I can't.
6703050 6706093 You made a lot of noise.
6727782 6732307 You don't want us to separate?<br />You're getting attached.
6836390 6838437 Squad, halt.
6840978 6843004 In position.
6851697 6853749 Aim.
6854033 6855327 Ready!
6855351 6856851 Fire!
6873553 6877081 Slim, Bill, take care of the horses.
7132228 7135823 It's been a long time, hasn't it, Tuco?
7135898 7140495 Every time I should have used<br />my right hand I thought of you.
7140569 7144494 But finally now I find you<br />in the right position.
7144574 7149670 And I had plenty of time to learn<br />how to shoot with the left.
7164677 7168771 When you shoot, you shoot.<br />You don't talk.
7170516 7174610 Every gun has its own voice.
7174634 7177634 And this one, I know.
7194708 7198252 Hank, follow him.
7254033 7256761 I'm coming, I'm coming right away.
7256852 7260856 Time to get dressed, and I'll open up.
7281252 7284671 Take off your gun<br />and put on your underpants.
7294290 7297084 Hey, Blond...
7297101 7300620 How did you get out of that sewer?
7301131 7306031 I got out in the company<br />of your old friend Sentenza.
7306110 7310059 Pig, coward, traitor, you talked?
7310073 7312141 Use your brain.
7312199 7315668 If I had talked I wouldn't be here now,<br />right?
7316036 7318964 You mean that...
7318988 7321988 ... only you know your half?
7326848 7328696 Blond...
7328716 7333094 I knew that you'd prefer to work with me,<br />instead of with that pig.
7333178 7335231 I'll go, I'll kill him, and I'll come back.
7335806 7339807 Listen... I forgot one detail...
7340620 7345148 Sentenza is not alone<br />There are five of them.
7346066 7349594 - Five?<br />- And all quick.
7351780 7355303 That's why you came to Tuco.
7357453 7360597 It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.
7371842 7374870 He must have been shot from a metre away.
7393906 7395758 Look who it is.
7395782 7398853 The other one won't be far away.
7400454 7403473 And they’ll come looking for us.
7403884 7406806 Be careful.
7406930 7409796 There are two of them.
7409797 7412116 And they don't come to argue.
7420416 7424441 You over there. We're going.
7458011 7461014 Are you going to die alone?
7571124 7572150 Hey!
7597276 7598723 Hey, Blond...
7598724 7600726 Sentenza is my stuff.
7600750 7602750 All right.
7618714 7620311 Got you!
7641278 7645299 "I'll see you again... "
7646033 7648101 "Idiot."
7648825 7651325 It's for you.
7675312 7678611 What tranquillity, what peace, Blond.
7678690 7681288 From a cemetery?
7681985 7684955 There must be a bridge<br />over the river down there.
7685030 7690084 - It will be better to cross it at night.<br />- What are you worried about?
7691703 7694755 Now you have to leave it to me.<br />Tuco knows what he's doing.
7694838 7697518 We'll cross the bridge now<br />and you'll see that...
7697602 7699649 Gentlemen...
7702548 7705691 - Notify the commander.<br />- Yes, sir.
7705717 7708740 Please. You want to follow me?
7754850 7758873 We caught them nearby, Commander.
7771908 7776003 - Where are you from?<br />- Illinois.
7778373 7782453 - And you?<br />- I'm with him.
7787966 7791144 What were you doing around here?
7791162 7794740 We've come to enlist, General.
7796641 7799044 Then learn to distinguish rank.
7799068 7802106 I'm a captain.
7802607 7805134 Out of the way you.
7805401 7810405 Go and make a will,<br />maybe today it's your turn.
7814242 7818437 So, you want to enlist?
7818497 7821525 But you have to take a test.
7830634 7833156 Let me see.
7851780 7853780 Hey...
7855700 7860001 You'll make a career in the army,<br />you'll at least become a colonel.
7860080 7862953 - You say?<br />- Sure.
7862974 7865047 As the manuals say...
7865127 7870674 ... you're the typical expert<br />in the handling of weapons.
7870674 7876750 Because this, is the most<br />powerful weapon of war.
7877681 7880704 Fighting spirit.
7882286 7884288 Volunteers...
7885898 7889096 You want to enlist?
7889134 7890656 Come, come.
7890680 7892722 Come on, now.
7894823 7897846 No shooting yet.
7907370 7909370 Hey?
7914260 7916913 Whoever has the most bottles<br />to get the soldiers drunk...
7916914 7921041 ... and send them to the slaughterhouse,<br />that's the one who wins.
7921099 7927700 We and those on the other side of the river<br />have only one thing in common...
7927772 7930500 The stench of alcohol.
7937950 7941478 What did you say your name was?
7942787 7944884 And you?
7947617 7949618 No.
7951838 7953046 No matter.
7953118 7956126 Names don't matter.
7956218 7962519 Soon you will be those dear glorious boys<br />of Lexton Bridge.
7962599 7966274 - Two attacks a day.<br />- Two attacks a day?
7966353 7973503 Of course, the Southerners have decided<br />that the bridge is the key to this area.
7973568 7976346 Stupid, useless bridge.
7976404 7980324 A fly shit on the maps of High Command.
7980367 7986768 And High Command has decided<br />that we have to take the fly shit...
7986773 7989267 ... even if we all have to die.
7989342 7994761 Otherwise,<br />the key remains hanging on the wall.
7994839 7996712 And that's not all.
7996736 7999510 We want the bridge in one piece.
7999511 8005609 The slavers want it intact.<br />And we want it intact.
8006686 8011134 You'll fall boys,<br />you'll rot in the ground...
8011189 8014708 ... but the bridge will still be standing.
8015444 8020540 Is it bad for me to talk<br />to two volunteers like that?
8020540 8024108 But then I've done worse.
8027289 8029743 I blew up the bridge.
8029767 8031875 Boom!
8031876 8036046 In here, I blew it up.
8036047 8041470 It's a serious crime, a court-martial offence,<br />to imagine...
8041553 8047649 ... dreaming of blowing up Lexton Bridge.
8048977 8051445 Do it for real.
8052939 8056794 Yeah, what does it take?<br />Let's make a big boom, Captain.
8058612 8062131 You think I haven't thought about it?
8065035 8068058 I even studied a plan.
8069164 8070791 Sure.
8070815 8074626 The best is after the attack...
8074627 8078480 ... when there is a truce<br />to collect the wounded.
8078506 8083524 If I did, I would save the lives<br />of thousands of men.
8088767 8092340 But it's the guts that I lack.
8096941 8100070 It's the daily slaughter that begins.
8100153 8103703 Commander, the companies await<br />the order to attack.
8103782 8105875 I'm ready.
8121466 8126518 Come... come and enjoy the spectacle.
8156960 8160988 Companies, ready!
8161423 8163517 Company B ready!
8163518 8165761 Company F ready!
8165762 8168763 Company G ready!
8173561 8177635 Companies, forward!
8197818 8198894 Hey, Blond...
8198960 8202530 That captain really seems<br />to be looking for the right bullet.
8202590 8204666 Yeah.
8256226 8261256 I've never seen so many people die,<br />so badly.
8280583 8285613 This war has all the air of a long affair.
8287966 8290118 Blond...
8290134 8294328 The dollars are on the other side<br />of the river.
8294347 8296440 Where?
8298351 8302430 <i>Amigo,</i> I told you, on the other side.
8302505 8306580 But as long as the Confederates are there,<br />nothing can be done.
8307318 8312693 Well, what if by chance<br />someone blows up this bridge?
8312699 8314325 Yeah.
8314325 8318195 They would go and slaughter<br />each other in another place.
8318246 8320263 Maybe.
8355199 8358743 Doctor, quick, the commander is wounded!
8362582 8365134 Hurry up with the stretcher!
8367462 8370555 Easy, take it easy.
8379307 8381380 Medic!
8401871 8405399 Take a swig, Captain.
8410338 8415887 Keep your ears open,<br />let's make a little noise.
8464058 8466077 What are you doing?
8565801 8567701 Hey, Blond...
8567703 8570377 You know that this time<br />we can both croak?
8570456 8572109 Yes, of course.
8572192 8575145 But it would be even worse<br />if just one croaked.
8575146 8581739 The other would no longer be able to find<br />that money, and it would be a real shame.
8611414 8613440 Doctor.
8614667 8616764 Doctor...
8616765 8619971 ... let me live a little longer.
8619972 8623024 I'm waiting for news.
8672433 8675678 Let's each tell each other his half.
8675702 8678280 Well, why not?
8678981 8680773 You go first.
8680842 8683885 I say it's better...
8684809 8687809 ... it's better if you go first.
8693537 8696080 All right.
8697249 8700343 The name of the cemetery is...
8717520 8720548 Sad Hill! And now it's your turn!
8727947 8730996 The name on the grave is...
8734412 8737414 Arch Stanton.
8738040 8741884 Arch Stanton? Are you sure?
8742553 8744651 Yes, sure.
8883269 8885316 Tuco.
8887356 8889454 Who is it?
9453088 9456156 It's quicker with that.
9495547 9497791 Two of you can do it even quicker.
9497792 9499800 Dig.
9502637 9505189 You don't dig?
9516526 9521380 You wouldn't find it even in a year.
9521990 9524037 Why?
9525118 9528112 Because in here...
9528146 9531150 ... there are no dollars.
9539574 9540800 Son of...
9540801 9543829 You thought I'd trust you?
9545931 9549134 Two hundred thousand dollars is a lot.
9549142 9552712 We have to earn it.
9555440 9556987 How?
9568078 9571581 I'll write the name here.
9574417 9576464 The gun.
9942619 9944940 Pig! He could have killed me!
9944964 9947465 When did you unload it?
9948166 9950918 Last night.
9951002 9955503 You see, the world is divided<br />into two categories...
9955504 9958017 ... those who have a loaded gun...
9958018 9960378 ... and those who dig.
9960379 9962147 You dig.
9962171 9964171 Where?
9977278 9979706 Unknown.
9979706 9982249 But this one is unmarked!
9982992 9986065 This one here too.
9986663 9989758 Carson just said...
9989759 9994792 ... an unmarked grave,<br />close to that of Stanton.
10001469 10003562 Dig.
10059444 10060444 Blond!
10060445 10064494 Dollars! Here they are, they're here!<br />Dollars!
10080381 10085452 You're joking, right, Blond.<br />You want to play a joke on me.
10085720 10088798 It's not a joke, it's a rope.
10088848 10092919 Come on, put your neck in it, Tuco.
10161546 10165545 So, like old times...
10167969 10170992 Half to you...
10176352 10179374 ... and half to me.
10209877 10211896 Blond!
10220438 10222986 Blond!
10230740 10233283 Blond!
10242919 10245514 Blond!
10254538 10257038 Blond!
10271462 10274462 Blond!
10300351 10302374 Blond!
10362096 10365149 Hey, Blond!
10366500 10370500 You know whose son you are?
10371589 10376667 You're the son of a bitch!
