596805 598295 You're...
598681 600512 From baker?
610902 613188 Tell baker that I told him<br />all that I know already.
613238 614998 Tell him I want to live in peace,<br />understand?
615031 617864 That it's no use<br />to go on tormenting me!
617992 620825 I know nothing at all<br />about that case of coins.
620870 622056 Now that gold has disappeared.
622080 625538 But if he'd listened to me,<br />we could have avoided this altogether.
626167 627998 I went to the army court.
628086 629792 There were no withesses.
629838 632045 They couldn't uncover any more.
632340 635173 I can't tell baker<br />what happened to the money.
635218 637049 Go back and tell him that!
639597 642054 Word's around you had a visitor...
643726 645717 And baker knows it.
647522 649478 Name of Jackson.
654696 656527 Jackson was here...
658074 660736 Or baker's got it all wrong.
668084 670075 He's not wrong.
670587 675047 Maybe baker would like to know<br />just what you and Jackson had to say...
675258 677465 About the cash box.
681389 684131 That's not what I'm being paid for.
688021 692105 I'm only interested in<br />what name Jackson's hiding under now!
695195 697902 Why do you think Jackson<br />may be assuming another name?
697947 700438 I would have found him already.
701117 704450 When I start off to find somebody,<br />I find them.
704579 706820 That's why they pay me.
712212 714749 What is baker paying you?
717508 719123 That your family?
729020 730020 Yes.
730939 733180 Nice family.
735318 737684 What does he pay you for murdering me?
740782 742443 $500.
743451 745032 To get the name!
751334 752790 The name!
762345 763345 Carson.
763972 765587 Bill Carson.
765807 768549 That's what he calls himself now.
798840 801422 Here's a lot of money: $1,000.
805555 807216 $1,000...
809767 811553 And some in gold.
811769 813680 That's a tidy sum.
817734 819349 But when I'm paid...
820111 821897 I always see the job through.
894894 896304 It's you.
896938 898769 Any information?
900608 902223 Too much.
903778 906611 He said quite a bit<br />that should interest you...
906697 909279 And one or two things<br />that interested me.
909325 911281 Such as?
911744 914326 The name Jackson's hiding under is...
914497 916078 Bill Carson.
918334 920290 That's your bit.
922922 924287 Keep talking.
924715 927297 He also mentioned somethin'<br />about a certain...
927427 930544 Cash box which just happened<br />to disappear.
931681 933091 That's my bit.
933808 935139 Anything else?
936018 938350 Not enough for you, huh?
938563 940474 Well, you don't have to worry.
940523 942980 He'll never say anything to anybody again!
944318 945899 Perfect.
946571 948402 Here you are.
948656 950396 Here, this is for you.
950450 952361 You did a good job for me.
952452 954158 Worth $500!
958166 960077 I almost forgot.
960168 962454 He gave me $1,000.
962712 965044 I think his idea was that I kill you.
972722 974804 But you know, the pity is,<br />when I'm paid...
975183 977674 I always follow my job through.
977977 979717 You know that.
1026317 1028558 No pistol, amigo.
1028653 1030393 It won't do you any good.
1030488 1032069 There are three of us.
1047171 1048171 Hey amigo.
1048756 1053500 You know that you have a face<br />beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?
1056055 1057055 Yeah.
1058891 1061633 But you don't look like<br />the one who will collect it.
1069735 1072397 A couple of steps back.
1126417 1127657 Thank you.
1137178 1139043 How much you worth now?
1139472 1140757 How much?
1142016 1143256 $2,000!
1146145 1147806 That's right, $2,000.
1148230 1150016 Yeah, $2,000.
1157239 1159321 Hijo de puta que te parié!
1159617 1161232 You'll pay for this!
1161285 1164118 I hope you end up in a graveyard...
1164163 1166870 With the cholera, and the rabies,<br />and the plague!
1166957 1170666 Cut me loose!<br />Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!
1170711 1172042 Put me down!
1172129 1174996 I hope your mother ends up<br />in a two-dollar whorehouse!
1175049 1177540 Cut me loose! Cut me loose!
1178636 1180467 You can still save yourself.
1180513 1183220 Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
1183474 1185010 Let me go!
1186102 1188969 I feel sick. The blood is rushing...
1190439 1192020 I'm dry.
1192983 1194848 Agua! Water!
1201659 1204150 You swine! You son of a bitch!
1206330 1208412 You're brave with a man who's tied up!
1208499 1210080 Come back!
1210167 1212078 Come back and fight!
1213087 1215043 You bastard!
1216006 1217462 Who the hell is that?
1217508 1219749 One bastard goes in, another comes out.
1219802 1221463 Cut it out! Cut it out!
1221512 1224800 I'm an honest farmer!<br />I'm innocent of any...
1227393 1229475 So, you're an honest farmer.
1229562 1231803 You recognize this man?
1232189 1234180 Yeah, it's you!
1235860 1238897 Who says so? You can't even read.
1239321 1241027 Roll it up. Roll it up!
1241115 1243697 I'll give you a good idea<br />where you can put it.
1243743 1247827 To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies<br />and all who gave birth to you!
1247913 1250655 Hey, everybody, look! Look!<br />He's giving him the filthy money!
1250708 1251823 Judas!
1251917 1253407 You've sold my hide!
1254211 1256247 But you won't enjoy any of that money,<br />not a penny.
1256338 1259330 If there's justice,<br />that money will go to the undertakers!
1259383 1262420 Every penny of it.<br />You know who you are?
1262595 1264881 You want to know whose son you are?
1264972 1267338 You don't, I do. Everybody does.
1267391 1269302 You're the son of a thousand fathers!
1269393 1270974 All bastards like you!
1271061 1273848 And your mother? Your mother...
1273898 1275354 You bastard!
1276317 1280902 Your mother, it's better not to<br />talk of her. I never hurt anybody!

1385342 1386878 $3,000!
1390639 1393472 There are two kinds of people<br />in the world, my friend.
1393517 1394828 Those with a rope around their neck...
1394852 1397594 And the people who have the job<br />of doing the cutting.
1397688 1400896 Listen, the neck at the end<br />of the rope is mine!
1400983 1403019 I run the risks.
1403444 1406902 So, the next time, I want more than half!
1407072 1409529 You may run the risks, my friend, but...
1409617 1411903 I do the cutting.
1412995 1415862 If we cut down my percentage...
1417207 1418663 Cigar?
1420294 1423786 It might interfere with my aim.
1425215 1429003 But if you miss,<br />you had better miss very well.
1429136 1432845 Whoever double-crosses me<br />and leaves me alive...
1432890 1436098 Ne understands nothing about tuco.
1437102 1438683 Nothing!
1442232 1444689 Wanted in 15 counties of this state...
1444777 1448645 The condemned, standing before us...<br />Sitting before us...
1448739 1452027 Tuco benedicto pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramirez...
1452117 1454429 Has been found guilty<br />by the third district circuit court...
1454453 1458321 Of the following crimes: Murder,<br />assaulting a justice of the peace...
1458415 1460872 Raping a virgin of the white race...
1460918 1464877 And statutory rape<br />of a minor of the black race...
1465255 1468793 Of derailing a train<br />in order to Rob the passengers...
1474473 1476259 What'd you find out, shorty?
1476350 1478215 If you ask me, it seems like a book!
1478268 1482511 An armed unit, escorting a cash box<br />of gold coins, meets a yankee ambush...
1482564 1485055 And only three of them are saved.
1485109 1487566 Stevens, baker, and Jackson.
1487611 1490068 The thing that wasn't saved, though,<br />was the coins.
1490155 1492942 But then the army decides, of course,<br />it ought to hold a hearing...
1493033 1494148 And Jackson's acquitted.
1494243 1497110 He disappears, and becomes bill Carson.
1497287 1498242 I know his name.
1498288 1501451 But you don't know<br />just who you're lookin' for, and I do!
1501542 1505535 And when he's found,<br />I'd be scared to be put in his shoes!
1507965 1510877 - Where is Carson?<br />- All I know is Carson re-enlisted.
1510926 1512416 The poor guy's minus an eye.
1512469 1514630 He lives with a girl called Maria,<br />who'll tell you.
1514722 1517179 She's a fresh young whore in the territory.
1517266 1518266 Where is she?
1518308 1522267 Now, what's the name of that town?<br />It's someplace very near...
1524773 1526604 Santa Ana.
1529028 1531485 Adios, half-soldier.
1536577 1537783 Hand me down a whiskey!
1549381 1552623 Glad they got him.<br />A man guilty of all those crimes!
1553010 1554946 People with ropes around their necks<br />don't always hang.
1554970 1557427 What do you mean?
1558682 1562470 Even a filthy beggar like that<br />has a protecting angel.
1569234 1572522 A golden-haired angel watches over him.
1572654 1575534 Of all these crimes, the accused<br />has made a full, spontaneous confession.
1576658 1580401 Therefore, we condemn him<br />to be hung by the neck until dead.
1580496 1583784 May the lord have mercy on his soul.<br />Proceed.
1598639 1600971 Let's get the hell out of here!
1632464 1635046 What are you saying?<br />Anybody can miss a shot?
1635092 1637048 Nobody misses<br />when I'm at the end of the rope!
1637094 1640712 You never had a rope around your neck.<br />Well, I'm going to tell you something.
1640806 1645175 When that rope starts to pull tight,<br />you can feel the devil bite your ass!
1648021 1649977 Yeah, you're right.
1650774 1652560 It's getting tougher.
1653527 1655358 The way I figure...
1655404 1659647 There's really not too much future<br />with a sawed-off runt like you.
1659741 1661151 What do you mean?
1661243 1665361 'Cause I don't think you'll ever<br />be worth more than $3,000.
1665873 1667955 What do you mean?
1668125 1671242 I mean, our partnership is untied.
1672045 1674001 Oh no, not you.
1674047 1676003 You remain tied.
1676049 1678961 I'll keep the money,<br />and you can have the rope.
1679136 1683220 You filthy, double-crossing bastard!<br />Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...
1683390 1686177 The way back to town is only 70 miles.
1687519 1691262 If you save your breath,<br />I feel a man like you could manage it.
1691315 1692555 Adios.
1692608 1695645 You filthy bastard! Come here!
1696069 1698981 Come here! Cut this rope off!<br />Get off that horse!
1699072 1701188 Get off that horse! You filthy coward!
1701283 1702443 If I ever catch you...
1702492 1704653 I'll rip your heart out and eat it!
1704745 1708533 I'll skin you alive!<br />I'll hang you up by your tongue.
1709958 1712828 I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
1714421 1718915 Such ingratitude, after all the times<br />I've saved your life.
1726350 1727806 You wouldn't leave me here...
1727893 1729383 Come back!
1729478 1731969 Wait! Listen, blondie!
1733482 1735643 Hijo de una gran puta!
1773689 1775645 You filthy rats!
1791999 1793489 Maria.
1800424 1802415 Is that you, bill?
1814563 1816428 Who are you?
1816565 1818556 What do you want with me?
1818692 1821604 Go on talking about bill Carson.
1822070 1824436 I don't know him.
1825073 1828361 You were calling to him in the dark!
1831997 1833112 Where is he?
1833206 1835868 What are you gonna do?
1836918 1839580 I'll ask the questions!
1841006 1842962 Where is he?
1850015 1851471 Where is he?
1860067 1862228 That's enough!
1863236 1864726 I don't know where he is.
1864780 1868364 He packed his things ten days ago,<br />and went away with his unit.
1868450 1869986 They all left.
1870035 1872447 Which company? Where'd he go?
1876333 1879291 Third cavalry, general sibley.
1880003 1882244 They left for Santa fe.
1882297 1885039 That's all I know. I swear!
1977350 1980433 I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.
2018266 2020552 Revolvers?
2025649 2027731 Revolvers!
2028443 2031651 Here's where I keep the best ones.
2036660 2039527 Remington, Colt, farroute...
2040830 2043788 Omith Wesson, Colt, from the Navy...
2045168 2048456 Joslyn, another Remington, and this...
2048922 2050753 That's enough.
2093508 2095590 Cartridges.
2103852 2106969 - You wanna try the pistol, just step...<br />- Let's go.
2190146 2192182 Cartridge.
2199989 2201069 How much?
2201157 2203022 $20.
2209958 2211789 $50.
2213086 2214872 How much?
2216089 2218080 $100.
2220719 2223802 $200. It's all I've got!
2245618 2247108 Come here!
2276357 2278143 This morning I heard the whole thing.
2278193 2280463 They say colonel canby's closing in<br />with his northerners...
2280487 2283320 And no later than tomorrow<br />that they'll be in the city.
2283364 2286356 That's why these southerners<br />are getting out!
2286451 2290740 You see, as soon as these cowards hear<br />there are blue shirts around, they run.
2290789 2293747 - These rebels have no will to fight!<br />- Poor things.
2293792 2295373 They'll soon be finished.
2295460 2296687 We get rid of these bastards...
2296711 2299168 Then we begin making money<br />on those Yankees.
2299214 2303457 They carry gold, not paper dollars.<br />And they're going to beat the south.
2304636 2307844 Look, see that one with the white beard<br />sitting in the wagon?
2307889 2311723 General sibley. He looks dead.<br />He's finally getting out of our hair.
2311810 2314768 Hooray for Dixie!<br />Hooray, hooray for Dixie!
2320527 2323018 Where's the owner of that horse?
2323154 2324360 Please, mister, sir...
2324447 2326483 - A bad heart condition...<br />- Where?
2326533 2328990 The war has frightened me already.
2329327 2331739 I'm looking for the owner of that horse.
2331788 2335030 He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar,<br />and he's a pig!
2335458 2336743 Where is he now?!
2336793 2339660 You leave him be! He doesn't know<br />who rides every horse!
2339921 2342708 You stay quiet, old hen!
2344175 2347508 Upstairs. Upstairs, in room 4, senor.
2353226 2354682 Hear that?
2360149 2363141 You rotten criminals, how dare you?!
2530403 2532189 Your spurs.
2544000 2546742 There are two kinds of spurs, my friend.
2546794 2549706 Those that come in by the door...
2549756 2552293 And those that come in by the window.
2552341 2554707 Take off that pistol belt.
2562060 2564016 It's empty.
2566105 2568096 Mine isn't.
2574197 2578156 Even when Judas hanged himself,<br />there was a storm, too.
2581537 2583994 That could be Cannon fire.
2584082 2587666 Cannon fire or storm,<br />it's all the same to you!
2589962 2592749 You ever see this before, my friend?
2601891 2604507 Throw it over the roof beam.
2606354 2608390 That's it.
2619408 2621524 And get on that!
2631254 2633040 That's right.
2633089 2635546 Now, make sure the rope is tight!
2635842 2638800 It's got to hold the weight of a pig!
2644934 2647767 Now, put the rope around your neck!
2654402 2656438 Yes, very good.
2657446 2659528 It's too big for your neck?
2659532 2661488 We'll fix that right away.
2661576 2663282 I have another system.
2663327 2666114 A little different than yours.
2666372 2668363 I don't shoot the rope.
2668457 2670789 I shoot the legs off the stool!
2675214 2676875 Adios.
2858397 2861935 Guilty of the following crimes:<br />Horse theft...
2880336 2882452 And shorty?
2905945 2908061 Sorry, shorty!
2908864 2911355 Move, come on, let's go!
2935850 2939092 I don't know. As soon as I hit<br />the desert, I'm thirsty.
2939353 2940513 Burns, huh?
2940563 2944351 They say people with fair skin<br />can't take too much.
2968674 2972007 Like that, you won't<br />have to carry so much.
2973345 2975301 Where are we going?
2975723 2976963 Where?
2977057 2979423 Where I'm going, amigo.
2980186 2981722 Over that way.
2981812 2985270 Another 100 miles<br />of beautiful sunbaked sand.
2986066 2988432 Even the armies are afraid<br />to march through there.
2988527 2990813 Sibley's men are retreating up there.
2990905 2993647 Canby's men are coming here...
2994241 2997654 But no one will set foot in this hell...
2998579 3001036 Except you and me.
3002541 3005749 One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.
3008214 3011331 What was it you told me the last time?
3012801 3016965 "If you save your breath,<br />I feel a man like you could manage it."
3018807 3021890 And if you won't manage it, you'll die.
3021936 3023472 Only slowly.
3024563 3026975 Very slowly, old friend.
3032321 3035233 After you, please. Start walking.
3151690 3153772 Taking a rest?
3154234 3158603 Come on, blondie, we don't have<br />very far to go. Only 70 miles.
3160115 3163733 Only eight and a half hours more<br />before sunset.
3163869 3166110 That's not too bad.
3167247 3169033 Come on!
3292247 3294238 And so, blondie...
3296502 3298538 It's goodbye.
3524771 3528389 $200,000 in gold. It's yours.<br />Just get me water!
3533739 3535946 What's that you say?
3535991 3537481 Who the hell are you?
3539911 3542277 My name's bill Carson now.
3543206 3544787 Surprise attack.
3546626 3547581 All dead.
3547627 3550710 My name is Jackson. Not Carson.
3551089 3552954 Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.
3553050 3556634 I'm Lincoln's grandfather.<br />What was that you said about the dollars?
3556678 3558794 $200,000, all mine.
3560057 3562639 Was the third cavalry's.
3563101 3565183 Baker has nothing.
3565771 3566931 The gold...
3567022 3569980 I hid the gold. The gold is safe!
3570734 3572599 Where? Here?
3573904 3575644 Talk!
3576073 3578155 In the cemetery.
3578241 3580232 Which cemetery?
3581286 3583618 On sad hill.
3583705 3585536 There's a grave by the...
3586374 3587864 Which grave?
3587959 3590416 Have a name? Have a number?
3590462 3592874 Come on, you dummy, talk!
3594508 3596749 There's no number.
3597219 3598709 There's a name.
3599888 3602095 It's written.
3608688 3609973 Water!
3612776 3615563 You talk first, eh?<br />I'll give you the water later!
3615695 3617401 Sad hill cemetery, okay?
3617489 3618729 In a grave, okay.
3618824 3621406 But it must have<br />a hame or a number on it.
3621493 3624485 There must be 1,000, 5,000, you...!
3628375 3630286 Don't die.
3630335 3632701 Don't die! I'll get you water!
3632838 3636205 Stay there.<br />Don't move, I'll get you water.
3636258 3638590 Don't die until later!
3664369 3665609 Get away from there!
3672210 3673996 He's dead.
3677549 3679335 I'll kill you!
3681761 3684969 If you do that, you'll always be poor.
3686057 3689265 Just like the greasy rat that you are.
3689644 3691851 If I were you, I'd...
3691855 3693516 Keep me alive.
3693690 3696022 What did he tell you?
3697194 3698354 A name.
3699571 3701402 Name on a grave.
3701656 3703362 What name?
3717088 3719170 Blondie, don't die.
3720258 3722670 Don't die! I'm your friend.
3722969 3726553 Please don't die. Please! I'm your friend!
3729684 3731845 I'll help you. I'll help you!
3731937 3734895 Don't move. I'll be right back.<br />I'll get the water.
3734940 3737431 Don't die like that pig.
3738985 3740646 Water, blondie?
3740695 3742686 Don't drink! It's no good for you.
3742822 3744687 Feel better?
3744783 3748492 Blondie, what's the matter?<br />Please don't die!
3777232 3778517 I've got a very sick man here.
3778608 3780098 But we have no more beds here.
3780151 3782563 Let him have yours!
3787742 3790074 - Where is Pablo Ramirez?<br />- Padre Ramirez.
3790161 3791822 He is away at the moment.
3792080 3794446 He should be back any day now.
3794541 3799001 It doesn't matter. For the moment,<br />we'll take very good care of my friend.
3799045 3800626 May god be praised.
3800714 3801954 In case you didn't know it...
3802007 3805875 God is on our side, too.<br />Because he hates the yanks.
3807595 3809051 Father, is he still breathing?
3809097 3811213 Yes, of course.
3811891 3813756 You're heavy.
3855643 3858601 All right, put a fresh bandage on him.
3859564 3861805 Put him in my cell.
3866821 3869233 Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.
3869324 3873363 Look out for him, please.<br />He's like a brother to me!
3892347 3895134 Father, did he speak?<br />Did he say anything?
3925547 3928209 Did he ask for me?<br />Did he speak about anything?
3928258 3931045 No, he hasn't spoken as yet.<br />But you mustn't worry.
3931094 3934962 He's both young and strong.<br />That's what's kept him going until now.
3935140 3937882 He should regain his strength<br />in a very short time.
3937892 3942181 Thank you, father. You don't know<br />how much this boy's life means to me!
4020934 4024677 The old father tells me<br />you'll be up and around in a few days.
4024854 4028221 You're very lucky to have me<br />so close when it happened.
4028566 4030978 Think, if you'd been on your own.
4033321 4034902 I mean, when...
4034989 4037446 _.whenoneisill...
4037784 4041242 It's good to have somebody close by,<br />friends or relations.
4043248 4044784 Do you...
4044874 4047081 You have parents, blondie?
4047544 4049000 A mother?
4049087 4051373 Not even a mother.
4052131 4053416 No one.
4054300 4057133 You're all alone, huh? Like me, blondie.
4057804 4060546 We're all alone in the world.
4060598 4062589 I have you, you have me.
4065687 4068019 Only for a little while, I mean.
4068398 4070309 It had to happen now.
4071025 4073516 What a dirty rotten trick of fate!
4073570 4076687 We could have all that money<br />in our hands.
4083037 4085653 I must tell you the truth, blondie.
4085748 4088956 In my place, you would do the same thing.
4090420 4092661 It's all over for you now.
4093381 4096339 There's nothing anyone can do anymore.
4100471 4102757 It's my fault! Mine, mine!
4115403 4119271 I'll tell you one thing, blondie.<br />If I knew that my last hour had come...
4119365 4123825 I swear, in my place, in your place,<br />I would do the same thing.
4125038 4128326 I would tell about the gold.<br />Yes, yes I would!
4128416 4130873 I would tell the name on the grave.
4130918 4133625 After all, what good is the money to you<br />if you're dead?
4133713 4135795 I know the name of the cemetery.
4135840 4138957 But you know how many graves<br />there are there?
4139010 4140216 Please.
4142347 4144303 Please, have a little.
4147602 4150560 Coffee? Please tell me the name.
4152649 4154185 On the grave.
4155026 4158018 If I get my hands on the $200,000.
4159864 4162446 I'll always honor your memory.
4162950 4166067 I swear it! I'll always honor your memory!
4169123 4171079 Come closer.
4176130 4177210 Tell me.
4182804 4185090 I'll sleep better...
4186391 4188973 Knowing my good friend...
4189227 4191263 Is by my side...
4191312 4192848 To protect me.
4204367 4206699 "Tuco, water. Please, water."
4207036 4210574 But if I get that name from you,<br />I'll give you water!
4217505 4220372 All right, you dirty skunk,<br />get your ass off the bed!
4220425 4222541 Come on, come on, the party's over.
4222635 4224375 The wagon is all ready to go.
4224679 4226657 From the way the wounded<br />are pouring into this place...
4226681 4229764 We better get the hell out of here<br />before we get caught up in the war.
4229851 4232684 Tuco, father Ramirez is back.
4232729 4236938 This is something I have to look into.<br />It'll only take a minute. Get moving.
4237066 4238681 - Where? This way?<br />- Yes.
4256502 4257582 Hey, Pablo!
4266095 4268336 Don't you recognize me?
4269891 4271631 It's me, tuco!
4272602 4274934 Let me embrace you.
4278024 4280936 I don't know the right thing!
4284989 4287230 I was just passing by here.<br />I said to myself...
4287492 4291326 I wonder if my brother<br />remembers his brother.
4293748 4295579 Did I do wrong?
4296918 4299534 It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.
4299587 4301873 You've seen me, tuco.
4303758 4306340 Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.
4312183 4315141 Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.
4316479 4319767 Let's talk about you. It's more important.
4320107 4321938 You look very well.
4322485 4325147 A bit thin, perhaps, but...
4326280 4329238 You always were thin, eh pablito”?
4331911 4333993 What about our parents?
4335206 4337492 Only now do you think of them?
4338668 4340704 To begin after nine years?
4342880 4344745 Nine years?
4346050 4347506 So it's nine years.
4351055 4354092 Our mother has been dead a long time now.
4355268 4358601 Our father died only a few days ago.
4358688 4360599 That's why I was away.
4362859 4365271 He asked for you to be there.
4365319 4367651 But there was only me.
4374495 4376531 And you?
4376581 4379698 Outside of evil,<br />what else have you managed to do?
4381085 4384577 It seems to me<br />you once had a wife someplace.
4387008 4389090 Not one, lots of them!
4389135 4391797 One here, one there,<br />wherever I found them.
4392972 4395805 Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
4397518 4399850 What good would that be?
4401105 4403562 Just keep on the way you're going.
4403649 4405105 Go away.
4406527 4407796 The lord have mercy on your soul.
4407820 4411358 I'll go, I'll go. While I'm waiting<br />for the lord to remember me...
4411490 4415153 I, tuco Ramirez,<br />brother of brother Ramirez...
4415202 4417193 Will tell you something.
4417288 4419279 You think you're better than I am.
4419373 4422035 Where we came from,<br />if one did not want to die of poverty...
4422084 4424496 One became a priest or a bandit!
4424545 4427127 You chose your way, I chose mine.
4427214 4428875 Mine was harder.
4429050 4430790 You talk of our mother and father.
4430843 4432959 You remember when you left<br />to become a priest.
4433054 4434464 I stayed behind!
4434513 4438347 I must have been ten, twelve.<br />I don't remember which, but I stayed.
4438392 4440804 I tried, but it was no good.
4440895 4443056 Now I am going to tell you something.
4443105 4444665 You became a priest because you were...
4444732 4447724 Too much of a coward to do what I do!
4478265 4480506 Please, forgive me, brother.
4510214 4511875 My belly's full.
4513467 4515458 Nice guy, my brother.
4515803 4518169 I didn't tell you<br />my brother was in charge here.
4518264 4520471 Everything, like the pope almost.
4520474 4522465 He's in charge in Rome.
4522476 4526014 My brother, he says to me:<br />"Stay, brother, don't go home."
4526105 4527891 "We never see each other.”
4527940 4532400 "Here, there's plenty to eat and drink.<br />Bring your friend, too."
4532445 4534811 Whenever we see each other,<br />he never lets me go.
4534864 4537276 It's always the same story.
4537324 4539986 My brother, he's crazy about me.
4543831 4544741 That's so.
4544790 4548123 Even a tramp like me,<br />no matter what happens...
4548961 4554456 I know there's a brother somewhere<br />who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.
4555843 4557253 Sure.
4558637 4562596 Well, after a meal,<br />there's nothing like a good cigar.
4630584 4632040 Wake up, you!
4632419 4633875 The troops are coming!
4633921 4635957 Blue or gray?
4642721 4647055 They're gray like us. Let's say "hello"<br />to them and then get going.
4647101 4650389 Hurrah for the confederacy! Hurrah!
4650437 4652519 Down with general Grant!
4652606 4655518 Hurrah for general... what's his name?
4655568 4656603 Lee!
4659697 4663155 God is with us<br />because he hates the yanks, too!
4664910 4668698 God is not on our side<br />'cause he hates idiots also.
4688559 4690174 Prisoners of war...
4690269 4691975 Forward...
4692855 4694061 March!
4756835 4759121 Form a single file.
4818897 4820512 Robert Clark.
4820607 4821847 Present.
4822776 4824061 Sam Richmond.
4824111 4825351 Present.
4828490 4829946 Bill Carson.
4836248 4838239 I said bill Carson!
4839043 4841955 Hey, blondie, isn't that angel eyes?
4842463 4845705 All right, what's he doing”? Sleeping?!
4848594 4851757 Yeah, and you better be bill Carson.
4854767 4856177 That's me!
4864485 4866646 Please, Carson.
4867821 4869561 Answer, "present"!
4871200 4873361 What are you, deaf?
4879041 4881999 Now, suppose you say "present," Carson.
4883420 4886332 I like big fat men like you.
4886382 4888794 When they fall, they make more noise.
4888842 4891424 And sometimes they never get up.
4892346 4894211 Wallace...
4895724 4897464 That's enough.
4900104 4901935 Sergeant!
4903482 4906474 The captain wants to see you right away.
4909405 4912238 Be sure these two get good treatment.
4922334 4925952 Hey, blondie, did you hear that?<br />Good treatment!
4932886 4935377 For the last time, sergeant...
4935431 4936511 I'm telling you...
4936598 4939681 I want the prisoners<br />treated as prisoners.
4940436 4942222 No more brutality!
4943355 4947143 There's hundreds of prisoners out there<br />and only a few men to guard them.
4947234 4949566 What am I supposed to do?<br />I have to have respect!
4949611 4954446 I think that you'll manage to gain<br />their respect by treating them better!
4955826 4958408 Are our men treated that well<br />in andersonville camp?
4958495 4961282 I don't give a goddamn<br />what they do in andersonville!
4961331 4963663 While I'm in charge here,<br />the prisoners are not to be...
4963750 4964865 Tortured...
4964918 4966624 Or cheated...
4966712 4968327 Or murdered!
4968630 4970416 Is that an accusation?
4970507 4973840 Sergeant, gangrene is eating<br />my leg away...
4974636 4976251 Not my eyes.
4976346 4979429 I know the prisoners here are being<br />robbed systematically.
4979516 4983350 I know there's scum around,<br />or bivouacked near the camp, waiting...
4983395 4986307 For someone to deliver this loot.
4986398 4990141 But as long as I'm commandant,<br />I won't permit any such trickery!
4990194 4991775 Am I clear?
4993572 4994857 Yes, sir.
4995032 4998149 Just as long as you're the commandant.
4999203 5000784 Yes, sergeant.
5003665 5006953 I know this leg means<br />I won't last very long...
5007044 5009911 But I pray I can manage<br />to have enough time...
5009963 5014957 To amass evidence and bring to a<br />court-martial all those who discredit...
5015719 5018301 And dishonor the uniform...
5018555 5020216 Of the union!
5024478 5026184 I wish you luck.
5060806 5063639 You and the others better lay low<br />for a few days.
5064935 5068553 I'll keep this. You go.<br />Wallace will let you know.
5080951 5083442 - Bring me Carson.<br />- Right.
5097968 5100960 Angel eyes said for us<br />to lay low for a few days.
5101305 5104297 But we'll keep close enough<br />to keep an eye on things.
5104725 5106681 Come on, saddle your horses.
5117404 5118769 Come on in, tuco.
5119531 5121021 Don't be bashful.
5121950 5124236 There's no formalities here.
5135505 5137496 It's been a long time!
5141094 5142334 You're hungry.
5143347 5145008 Sit down. Eat!
5164451 5166191 I knew it, I knew it!
5168038 5170199 The minute I saw you, I said to myself:
5171375 5173787 "Look at that pig, angel eyes..."
5175212 5177669 "I'll bet he's got himself an easy job!"
5181009 5183000 "And he never forgets a friend!"
5183887 5186003 I never forget old friends, tuco.
5189976 5191932 It's good to see old friends again.
5195232 5197894 Especially when they come<br />from so far away...
5198652 5200893 .And have so much to talk about.
5202447 5205314 And you do have a lot to talk about,<br />haven't you?
5207911 5209572 You were captured near...
5209955 5210990 Fort Craig?
5215836 5218578 If you were with sibley,<br />then you were...
5219506 5221167 Coming from Santa fe?
5233812 5235643 Was it hard crossing the desert?
5236523 5237558 Very hard!
5239443 5242025 Especially if you don't have<br />anything to drink.
5244740 5247652 Why are you going under the name<br />of bill Carson, now?
5253373 5255614 One name is as good as another.
5256084 5258075 Not wise to use your own name.
5259129 5262542 Like you, I bet they don't call you<br />angel eyes.
5263592 5265503 Sergeant angel eyes.
5274561 5276802 Like a little music with your meal, tuco?
5277689 5278689 Music?
5279232 5282315 Yes, very good for the digestion.
5297834 5299950 Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
5305967 5307548 That fake, too?
5309262 5311753 Bill Carson's name is written on it.
5313475 5314806 Have some.
5315644 5317680 It's bill Carson's tobacco.
5401605 5404347 Was Carson dead or alive<br />when you found him?
5410864 5412980 What'd he tell you about the money?
5417037 5419278 I don't know what you're talking about!
5437265 5439051 More feeling.
5457285 5460618 You can sure consider yourself<br />much luckier than your pal.
5461081 5464039 Wallace will punch your friend<br />as long as the song goes.
5464084 5466826 So many of us have had a session in there.
5488400 5490391 How's your digestion now?
5494364 5495945 You'd better talk.
5496241 5498448 I have nothing to tell you!
5525979 5527594 Play that fiddle, you!
5572233 5574315 I'll talk!
5584204 5586411 What did he say about the money?
5591336 5592917 It's buried in a grave.
5594130 5595210 Where?
5598218 5600174 At the sad hill cemetery.
5602472 5604212 Which grave?
5604516 5606052 I don't know!
5610021 5611306 Blondie...
5614234 5616816 He knows the name of the grave.
5633503 5635118 The war's over for you.
5638883 5640498 Put those clothes on.
5644973 5646383 Why?
5646933 5648889 We're going for a ride.
5649936 5650936 Where?
5651020 5653386 To find $200,000.
5654440 5656681 I know the name of the cemetery now...
5657527 5659893 And you know the name of the grave.
5679924 5682916 You're not going to give me<br />the same treatment?
5686639 5688004 Would you talk?
5689392 5691428 No, probably not.
5693021 5694636 That's what I thought.
5695565 5697351 Not that you are any tougher than tuco...
5697817 5700854 But you're smart enough to know<br />that talking won't save you.
5704908 5707820 And tuco, is he?
5710163 5712199 No, not yet...
5713499 5715455 But he's in very good hands.
5717003 5719961 You changed partners,<br />but you still got the same deal.
5720298 5722880 I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
5724302 5725633 There's two of us.
5726012 5728503 It should make it easier than just one.
5754457 5756664 Hold it. That's it.
5757210 5758325 Don't move.
5759337 5760793 Don't breathe.
5764509 5766215 Got it. Thank you.
5782318 5785731 Hey, corporal, afraid he'll get lost?<br />Where's the rebel going?
5786030 5788692 To hell with a rope around his neck<br />and a price on his head.
5788741 5791232 Yeah, $3,000, friend.
5791744 5793860 That's a lot of money for a head.
5795039 5797906 I bet they didn't even pay you<br />a penny for your arm.
5804257 5807340 I told you once,<br />but if I ever get you down...
5807885 5810342 You're gonna need a lot of help<br />to get up again.
5830658 5832865 You're a lot luckier than that one there.
5832910 5835526 You get some proper rope,<br />and you're all finished.
5835580 5838617 And there isn't any partner, this time,<br />to shoot you down.
5863274 5864514 Get up!
5953406 5955897 Sure would like to put<br />your paw on it, huh?
5958202 5960158 I would like to piss, it's rough.
5960371 5962908 I've been shaken up in this train<br />nearly ten hours now.
5962999 5965081 You smell like a pig already!
5965877 5968368 Let's try not to make things any worse.
5970840 5972250 Get goin'
5981434 5984221 I can't while you're watching me.
6007460 6010247 You made a lot of noise my friend, huh?
6031150 6033106 You don't wanna break<br />our friendship, huh?
6033152 6034688 Well, I'll break it!
6177129 6179211 Clemens, take care of the horses.
6429131 6431747 I've been looking for you for eight months!
6432801 6435668 Whenever I should have had<br />a gun in my right hand...
6435930 6437170 I thought of you!
6437473 6440681 Now I find you in exactly<br />the position that suits me.
6441477 6445390 I had lots of time to learn<br />how to shoot with my left.
6461246 6463532 When you have to shoot, shoot!<br />Don't talk.
6467419 6470035 Every gun makes its own tune...
6470589 6472830 And it's perfect timing, large one.
6491318 6493559 Clem, follow him.
6550586 6552918 Just a minute. I'll be right there.
6553714 6556797 Just give me a little time to get dressed,<br />and I'll open up.
6577696 6580403 Put your drawers on,<br />and take your gun off.
6593545 6596252 How the hell did you get out<br />of that pigsty?
6597716 6601584 My own way.<br />I'm here with your old friend angel eyes.
6602679 6605546 You talked, you traitor! You talked!
6606517 6608132 No, I didn't talk.
6608727 6611389 If I did, I probably wouldn't be here, now.
6615609 6617941 So, only you know your half of the secret?
6625202 6627443 I'm very happy you are working with me!
6627746 6629202 And we're together again.
6629706 6632038 I'll get dressed, I kill him,<br />and be right back.
6632126 6634742 Listen, I forgot to mention.
6637589 6640171 He's not alone. There's five of 'em.
6642594 6644880 - Five?<br />- Yeah, five of 'em.
6648183 6650424 So, that's why you came to tuco.
6654022 6656604 It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all!
6668370 6670326 They shot him at close range.
6690058 6691764 Well, look who's here!
6692311 6694017 The other one will be along.
6696940 6698896 They'll come looking for us.
6700527 6701858 Watch out!
6703113 6704728 There's two of them.
6706116 6708277 I want that blond alive!
6717044 6720161 You back there. Come on, let's go!
6754498 6756659 Were you going to die alone?
6895013 6896469 Angel eyes is mine.
6896973 6898213 All right.
6937889 6939800 "See you soon.”
6942477 6943477 "Idiots."
6945272 6946512 It's for you.
6971548 6973709 How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
6974634 6976875 Like a cemetery, for instance?
6978388 6980674 There should be a bridge across that river.
6981475 6983011 We better wait for nightfall.
6983059 6984720 Trust in me, blondie.
6988064 6989929 I got a good sense of where I'm going.
6990025 6992937 Tuco has taken you this far,<br />I will take you all the way...
6999075 7000815 - Tell the captain.<br />- Yes, sir.
7002204 7004661 Come along now. Follow me.
7051294 7053751 We found them near the perimeter, sir.
7068311 7070142 Where do you hail from?
7070689 7072020 Lhlinois.
7074484 7075815 And you?
7077153 7084446 I'm with him.
7084452 7086534 Your reason for being around here?
7087664 7090121 We want to enlist, general!
7093128 7095289 You'd better learn to distinguish rank.
7095672 7097037 I'm a captain!
7099009 7100419 Get the hell out!
7102304 7105512 It sure as hell might be you today,<br />so go write your will.
7111896 7113852 So, you want to enlist.
7115025 7117186 You got to take a test to prove it.
7126745 7128201 Well, show me.
7152145 7156354 You've got a career.<br />At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel!
7156524 7158014 - Really?<br />- Sure!
7159361 7161067 Like it says in the manual.
7161571 7165814 You've got every qualification<br />to become expert in the use of weapons.
7167202 7170911 This is the most potent weapon in war!
7174125 7176286 The fighting spirit is in this bottle!
7178630 7180211 Volunteers...
7182342 7184298 You want to enlist?
7185595 7186675 Then let's go.
7191768 7193929 The shooting hasn't begun yet.
7195146 7199014 Yes, because soon you can join<br />the gallant heroes of branston bridge.
7201069 7204436 - We have two attacks a day.<br />- Two attacks a day?
7204781 7205781 Sure.
7205907 7209820 The reb's have decided that damn bridge<br />is the key to this whole area.
7211621 7213782 Stupid, useless bridge.
7214332 7216869 A flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
7218712 7223331 And headquarters has declared that<br />we must take that ridiculous flyspeck...
7225093 7226924 Even if all of us are killed.
7227303 7231387 Otherwise, the key'll get rusty<br />and just be a spot on the wall.
7233059 7234390 And that's not all.
7235061 7237427 Both sides want the bridge intact!
7237731 7241724 Intact is how the south wants it.<br />And we want it intact, too.
7244863 7248526 You'll all turn to dust,<br />but one thing is sure, boys...
7249451 7252284 Branston bridge will stand unbroken.
7253663 7254743 Is it bad...
7255123 7257535 To speak the way I do to volunteers?
7259002 7260913 I've done a lot worse.
7265508 7267544 I've done it. I've blown it up...
7270138 7273380 In here. I've destroyed it all.
7274225 7277638 It's a court-martial offense to imagine...<br />To dream of blowing it up.
7277687 7279393 A serious crime.
7279773 7283482 Even to think of destroying<br />that bridge is just...
7286780 7289066 Why not really blow it up, captain?
7290617 7294030 Yeah, captain, it's nothing.<br />Let's scare the hell out of them!
7297457 7299573 I've been dreaming about it.
7303254 7305290 I've even worked out a plan.
7306925 7308461 I sure havel
7309552 7312339 the best time is after the attack...
7312847 7315589 When there's a truce<br />to get the wounded.
7316768 7318008 If I could do it...
7318937 7320973 I could save many thousands of men.
7327070 7329026 But what I lack is the guts.
7335203 7338115 They're beginning the daily slaughter,<br />right on time.
7338498 7341205 Captain! All companies<br />are awaiting your orders.
7342001 7343582 I'll be right there.
7359352 7360637 All right, friends...
7361271 7363432 Come along and enjoy the spectacle.
7394888 7395923 Companies!
7396347 7397382 Report!
7397682 7399889 Company b, ready!
7437013 7440631 It looks like the captain is really asking<br />for a bullet in his guts!
7494445 7497733 I've never seen<br />so many men wasted so badly.
7518344 7521882 I've a feeling it's really gonna be<br />a good long battle.
7528354 7530720 The money is<br />on the other side of the river.
7532400 7533400 Where?
7536195 7539187 Amigo, I said on the other side.<br />That's enough.
7540283 7543320 But while the confederates are there,<br />we can't get across.
7545038 7549031 What would happen<br />if somebody were to blow up that bridge?
7552670 7555377 Then these idiots would go<br />somewhere else to fight!
7556215 7557330 Maybe.
7595463 7598296 Doctor, quick! The captain's wounded!
7600760 7602546 Hurry, a stretcher!
7604931 7606546 Easy, now.
7617485 7619100 Get things ready.
7640133 7641623 A little of this will help.
7648558 7650469 Take a slug of this, captain...
7651018 7653009 And keep your ears open.
7701819 7702899 What're you doing?
7805631 7808498 You realize we might be risking our lives?
7810052 7814011 If I get killed, you'll never get your<br />hands on all that beautiful money.
7817226 7819137 It sure would be a pity.
7854972 7857088 Can you help me live a little more?
7857808 7859548 I expect good news.
7872823 7875690 Why don't we tell each other<br />our half of the secret?
7876202 7878158 Why don't we?
7879705 7880990 You go first.
7883334 7885825 No, I think it's better that...
7888297 7889628 You start.
7893886 7894886 All right.
7897681 7900047 The name of the cemetery is...
7917952 7920113 Oad hill! Now it's your turn!
7928421 7930207 The name on the grave is...
7934885 7936250 Arch Stanton.
7938514 7939594 Arch Stanton?
7940307 7941638 Are you sure?
7942560 7944266 Sure, I'm sure.
8649558 8651594 It'd be a lot easier with that.
8692184 8694391 Two can dig a lot quicker than one.
8695061 8696141 Dig!
8699274 8700889 You're not digging?
8713163 8715870 If you shoot me,<br />you won't see a cent of that money.
8718668 8719668 Why?
8722672 8724037 I'll tell you why.
8725258 8726919 'Cause there's nothin' in there.
8737354 8739094 You thought I'd trust you?
8742359 8744691 $200,000 is a lot of money.
