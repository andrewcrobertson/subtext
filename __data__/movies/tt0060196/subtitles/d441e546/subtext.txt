641433 642934 You're...
643310 645145 ...from Baker?
655113 657407 Tell Baker that I told him all that I know already.
657449 659201 Tell him I want to live in peace, understand?
659242 662079 That it's no use to go on tormenting me!
662204 665040 I know nothing at all about that case of coins.
665082 666208 Now that gold has disappeared.
666291 669753 But if he'd listened to me,<br />we could have avoided this altogether.
670379 672214 I went to the Army court.
672297 674007 There were no witnesses.
674049 676259 They couldn't uncover any more.
676551 679388 I can't tell Baker what happened to the money.
679429 681264 Go back and tell him that!
683809 686269 Word's around you had a visitor...
687938 689940 ...and Baker knows it.
691733 693694 Name of Jackson.
698907 700742 Jackson was here...
702285 704955 ...or Baker's got it all wrong.
712295 714297 He's not wrong.
714798 719261 Maybe Baker would like to know<br />just what you and Jackson had to say...
719469 721680 ...about the cash box.
725600 728353 That's not what I'm being paid for.
732232 736319 I'm only interested in<br />what name Jackson's hiding under now!
739406 742117 Why do you think Jackson<br />may be assuming another name?
742159 744661 I would have found him already.
745328 748665 When I start off to find somebody, I find them.
748790 751042 That's why they pay me.
756423 758967 What is Baker paying you?
761720 763346 That your family?
773231 774149 Yes.
775150 777402 Nice family.
779529 781907 What does he pay you for murdering me?
784993 786661 $500.
787662 789247 ...to get the name!
795545 797005 The name!
806556 807557 Carson.
808183 809810 Bill Carson.
810018 812771 That's what he calls himself now.
843051 845637 Here's a lot of money: $1,000.
849766 851434 $1,000..
854020 855772 ...and some in gold.
856022 857899 That's a tidy sum.
861945 863572 But when I'm paid...
864322 866116 ...I always see the job through.
939105 940523 It's you.
941149 942984 Any information?
944819 946446 Too much.
947989 950825 He said quite a bit that should interest you...
950909 953495 ...and one or two things that interested me.
953536 955497 Such as?
955956 958541 The name Jackson's hiding under is...
958708 960293 ...Bill Carson.
962545 964506 That's your bit.
967133 968510 Keep talking.
968927 971513 He also mentioned somethin' about a certain...
971638 974766 ...cash box which just happened to disappear.
975892 977310 That's my bit.
978019 979354 Anything else?
980230 982565 Not enough for you, huh?
982774 984693 Well, you don't have to worry.
984734 987195 He'll never say anything to anybody again!
988530 990115 Perfect.
990782 992617 Here you are.
992867 994619 Here, this is for you.
994661 996579 You did a good job for me.
996663 998373 Worth $500!
1002377 1004295 I almost forgot.
1004379 1006673 He gave me $1,000.
1006923 1009259 I think his idea was that I kill you.
1016933 1019019 But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid...
1019394 1021896 ...I always follow my job through.
1022188 1023940 You know that.
1070945 1073198 No pistol, amigo.
1073281 1075033 It won't do you any good.
1075116 1076701 There are three of us.
1093218 1097514 You know that you have a face<br />beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?
1103520 1107690 But you don't look like the one who will collect it.
1114364 1117033 A couple of steps back.
1163538 1164789 Thank you.
1174299 1176134 How much you worth now?
1176593 1177886 How much?
1179137 1180388 $2,000!
1183266 1184934 That's right, $2,000.
1185351 1187145 Yeah, $2,000.
1194360 1196446 Hijo de puta que te pari√©!
1196738 1198364 You'll pay for this!
1198406 1201242 I hope you end up in a graveyard...
1201284 1203995 ...with the cholera, and the rabies, and the plague!
1204078 1207790 Cut me loose! Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!
1207832 1209167 Put me down!
1209250 1212128 I hope your mother ends up<br />in a two-dollar whorehouse!
1212170 1214672 Cut me loose! Cut me loose!
1215757 1217592 You can still save yourself.
1217634 1220345 Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
1220595 1222138 Let me go!
1223223 1226100 I feel sick. The blood is rushing...
1227560 1229145 I'm dry.
1230104 1231981 Agua! Water!
1238780 1241282 You swine! You son of a bitch!
1243451 1245536 You're brave with a man who's tied up!
1245620 1247205 Come back!
1247288 1249207 Come back and fight!
1250208 1252168 You bastard!
1253127 1254587 Who the hell is that?
1254629 1256881 One bastard goes in, another comes out.
1256923 1258591 Cut it out! Cut it out!
1258633 1261928 I'm an honest farmer! I'm innocent of any--
1264514 1266599 So, you're an honest farmer.
1266683 1268935 You recognize this man?
1269310 1271312 Yeah, it's you!
1272981 1276025 Who says so? You can't even read.
1276442 1278152 Roll it up. Roll it up!
1278236 1280822 I'll give you a good idea where you can put it.
1280863 1284951 To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies<br />and all who gave birth to you!
1285034 1287787 Hey, everybody, look! Look!<br />He's giving him the filthy money!
1287829 1288955 Judas!
1289038 1290540 You've sold my hide!
1291332 1293376 But you won't enjoy any of that money, not a penny.
1293459 1296462 If there's justice,<br />that money will go to the undertakers!
1296504 1299549 Every penny of it. You know who you are?
1299716 1302010 You want to know whose son you are?
1302093 1304470 You don't, I do. Everybody does.
1304512 1306431 You're the son of a thousand fathers!
1306514 1308099 All bastards like you!
1308182 1310977 And your mother? Your mother...
1311019 1312478 You bastard!
1313438 1318026 Your mother, it's better not to talk of her.<br />I never hurt anybody!
1318359 1321446 ...wanted in 14 counties of this state...
1322530 1327368 ...the condemned is found guilty<br />of the crimes of murder, armed robbery...
1327994 1331664 ...of citizens, state banks, and post offices...
1331706 1335710 ...the theft of sacred objects,<br />arson in a state prison...
1335835 1339630 ...perjury, bigamy,<br />deserting his wife and children...
1340548 1344552 ...inciting prostitution, kidnapping, extortion...
1344635 1347722 ...receiving stolen goods, selling stolen goods...
1347764 1352727 ...passing counterfeit money,<br />and contrary to the laws of this state...
1352935 1355938 ...the condemned is guilty of using...
1357357 1360902 Therefore, according to the powers vested in us...
1361569 1364447 ...we sentence the accused here before us...
1364489 1368242 ...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez...
1368409 1369619 ...known as the "Rat"...
1369702 1372663 ...and any other aliases he might have...
1373539 1375333 ...to hang by the neck until dead.
1375416 1378795 May God have mercy on his soul. Proceed!
1404695 1406781 Five for you.
1407156 1409784 One, two, three, four...
1410493 1411619 ...five for me.
1413204 1415289 Five for you...
1415373 1417959 ...and five for me.
1418292 1420336 Know how much you're worth now?
1420378 1422296 No, how much?
1422463 1424006 $3,000!
1427760 1430596 There are two kinds of people<br />in the world, my friend.
1430638 1431931 Those with a rope around their neck...
1431973 1434725 ...and the people who have the job<br />of doing the cutting.
1434809 1438020 Listen, the neck at the end of the rope is mine!
1438104 1440148 I run the risks.
1440565 1444026 So, the next time, I want more than half!
1444193 1446654 You may run the risks, my friend, but...
1446737 1449031 ...I do the cutting.
1450116 1452994 If we cut down my percentage...
1454328 1455788 Cigar?
1457415 1460918 ...it might interfere with my aim.
1462336 1466132 But if you miss, you had better miss very well.
1466257 1469969 Whoever double-crosses me and leaves me alive...
1470011 1473222 ...he understands nothing about Tuco.
1474223 1475808 Nothing!
1479353 1481814 Wanted in 15 counties of this state...
1481898 1485776 ...the condemned, standing before us...<br />sitting before us...
1485860 1489155 ...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez...
1489238 1491532 ...has been found guilty<br />by the Third District Circuit Court...
1491574 1495453 ...of the following crimes:<br />murder, assaulting a justice of the peace...
1495536 1497997 ...raping a virgin of the white race...
1498039 1502001 ...and statutory rape of a minor of the black race...
1502376 1505922 ...of derailing a train<br />in order to rob the passengers...
1511594 1513387 What'd you find out, Shorty?
1513471 1515348 If you ask me, it seems like a book!
1515389 1519644 An armed unit, escorting a cash box<br />of gold coins, meets a Yankee ambush...
1519685 1522188 ...and only three of them are saved.
1522230 1524690 Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.
1524732 1527193 The thing that wasn't saved, though, was the coins.
1527276 1530071 But then the Army decides, of course,<br />it ought to hold a hearing...
1530154 1531280 ...and Jackson's acquitted.
1531364 1534242 He disappears, and becomes Bill Carson.
1534408 1535368 I know his name.
1535409 1538579 But you don't know<br />just who you're lookin' for, and I do!
1538663 1542667 And when he's found,<br />I'd be scared to be put in his shoes!
1545086 1548005 - Where is Carson?<br />- All I know is Carson re-enlisted.
1548047 1549549 The poor guy's minus an eye.
1549590 1551759 He lives with a girl called Maria, who'll tell you.
1551842 1554303 She's a fresh young whore in the territory.
1554387 1555388 Where is she?
1555429 1559392 Now, what's the name of that town'?<br />It's someplace very near...
1561894 1563729 Santa Ana.
1566148 1568609 Adios, half-soldier.
1573698 1574907 Hand me down a whiskey!
1586502 1589755 Glad they got him. A man guilty of all those crimes!
1590131 1592008 People with ropes around their necks<br />don't always hang.
1592091 1594552 What do you mean?
1595803 1599599 Even a filthy beggar like that<br />has a protecting angel.
1606355 1609650 A golden-haired angel watches over him.
1609775 1612486 Of all these crimes, the accused<br />has made a full, spontaneous confession.
1613988 1617742 Therefore, we condemn him<br />to be hung by the neck until dead.
1617825 1621120 May the Lord have mercy on his soul. Proceed.
1635968 1638304 Let's get the hell out of here!
1669794 1672380 What are you saying? Anybody can miss a shot?
1672421 1674382 Nobody misses when I'm at the end of the rope!
1674423 1678052 You never had a rope around your neck.<br />Well, I'm going to tell you something.
1678135 1682515 When that rope starts to pull tight,<br />you can feel the devil bite your ass!
1685351 1687311 Yeah, you're right.
1688104 1689897 It's getting tougher.
1690856 1692692 The way I figure...
1692733 1696987 ...there's really not too much future<br />with a sawed-off runt like you.
1697071 1698489 What do you mean?
1698572 1702702 'Cause I don't think you'll ever<br />be worth more than $3,000.
1703202 1705287 What do you mean?
1705454 1708582 I mean, our partnership is untied.
1709375 1711335 Oh no, not you.
1711377 1713337 You remain tied.
1713379 1716298 I'll keep the money, and you can have the rope.
1716465 1720553 You filthy, double-crossing bastard!<br />Of all the stinking, dirty tricks--
1720720 1723514 The way back to town is only 70 miles.
1724849 1728602 If you save your breath,<br />I feel a man like you could manage it.
1728644 1729895 Adios.
1729937 1732982 You filthy bastard! Come here!
1733399 1736318 Come here! Cut this rope off! Get off that horse!
1736402 1738529 Get off that horse! You filthy coward!
1738612 1739780 If I ever catch you...
1739822 1741991 ...I'll rip your heart out and eat it!
1742074 1745870 I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up by your tongue.
1747288 1750082 I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
1750124 1750166 I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
1751751 1756255 Such ingratitude, after all the times<br />I've saved your life.
1763679 1765139 You wouldn't leave me here...
1765222 1766724 Come back!
1766807 1769310 Wait! Listen, Blondie!
1770811 1772980 Hijo de una gran puta!
1811018 1812978 You filthy rats!
1829328 1830830 Maria.
1837753 1839755 Is that you, Bill?
1851892 1853769 Who are you?
1853894 1855896 What do you want with me?
1856021 1858941 Go on talking about Bill Carson.
1859400 1861777 I don't know him.
1862403 1865698 You were calling to him in the dark!
1869326 1870452 Where is he'?
1870536 1873205 What are you gonna do?
1874248 1876917 I'll ask the questions!
1878335 1880296 Where is he'?
1887344 1888804 Where is he'?
1897396 1899565 That's enough!
1900566 1902067 I don't know where he is.
1902109 1905696 He packed his things ten days ago,<br />and went away with his unit.
1905779 1907323 They all left.
1907364 1909783 Which company? Where'd he go?
1913662 1916624 Third Cavalry, General Sibley.
1917333 1919585 They left for Santa Fe.
1919627 1922379 That's all I know. I swear!
2014680 2017766 I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.
2055596 2057890 Revolvers?
2062978 2065064 Revolvers!
2065773 2068984 Here's where I keep the best ones.
2073989 2076867 Remington, Colt, Farroute...
2078160 2081121 ...Smith Wesson, Colt, from the Navy...
2082498 2085793 Jocelyn, another Remington, and this--
2086251 2088087 That's enough.
2130838 2132923 Cartridges.
2141181 2144309 - You wanna try the pistol, just step--<br />- Let's go.
2227476 2229519 Cartridge.
2237319 2238403 How much?
2238487 2240364 $20.
2247287 2249122 $50.
2250415 2252209 How much?
2253418 2255420 $100.
2258048 2261134 $200. It's all I've got!
2282948 2284449 Come here!
2313687 2315480 This morning I heard the whole thing.
2315522 2317774 They say Colonel Canby's closing in<br />with his Northerners...
2317816 2320652 ...and no later than tomorrow<br />that they'll be in the city.
2320694 2323697 That's why these Southerners are getting out!
2323780 2328076 You see, as soon as these cowards hear<br />there are blue shirts around, they run.
2328118 2331079 - These rebels have no will to fight!<br />- Poor things.
2331121 2332706 They'll soon be finished.
2332789 2333957 We get rid of these bastards...
2334041 2336501 ...then we begin making money on those Yankees.
2336543 2340797 They carry gold, not paper dollars.<br />And they're going to beat the South.
2341965 2345177 Look, see that one with the white beard<br />sitting in the wagon?
2345218 2349056 General Sibley. He looks dead.<br />He's finally getting out of our hair.
2349139 2352100 Hooray for Dixie! Hooray, hooray for Dixie!
2357856 2360359 Where's the owner of that horse?
2360484 2361693 Please, mister, sir...
2361777 2363820 - ...a bad heart condition...<br />- Where?
2363862 2366323 The war has frightened me already.
2366656 2369076 I'm looking for the owner of that horse.
2369117 2372371 He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar, and he's a pig!
2372788 2374081 Where is he now?!
2374122 2377000 You leave him be! He doesn't know<br />who rides every horse!
2377042 2379836 You stay quiet, old hen!
2381088 2384424 Upstairs. Upstairs, in Room 4, senor.
2390138 2391598 Hear that?
2397062 2400065 You rotten criminals, how dare you?!
2577867 2579661 Your spurs.
2591881 2594634 There are two kinds of spurs, my friend.
2594676 2597596 Those that come in by the door...
2597637 2600181 ...and those that come in by the window.
2600223 2602601 Take off that pistol belt.
2609941 2611901 It's empty-
2614029 2616031 Mine isn't.
2622078 2626082 Even when Judas hanged himself,<br />there was a storm, too.
2629419 2631880 That could be cannon fire.
2631963 2635550 Cannon fire or storm, it's all the same to you!
2637844 2640639 You ever see this before, my friend?
2649773 2652400 Throw it over the roof beam.
2654235 2656279 That's it.
2667290 2669417 And get on that!
2679135 2680929 That's right.
2680970 2683431 Now, make sure the rope is tight!
2683723 2686685 It's got to hold the weight of a pig!
2692816 2695652 Now, put the rope around your neck!
2702283 2704327 Yes, very good.
2705328 2707414 It's too big for your neck?
2707455 2709374 We'll fix that right away.
2709457 2711167 I have another system.
2711209 2714003 A little different than yours.
2714254 2716256 I don't shoot the rope.
2716339 2718675 I shoot the legs off the stool!
2723096 2724764 Adios.
2906696 2910241 ...guilty of the following crimes: horse theft...
2928635 2930762 And Shorty?
2954243 2956371 Sorry, Shorty!
2957205 2959666 Move, come on, let's go!
2984148 2987402 I don't know. As soon as I hit<br />the desert, I'm thirsty.
2987652 2988820 Burns, huh?
2988903 2992657 They say people with fair skin can't take too much.
3016973 3020309 Like that, you won't have to carry so much.
3021644 3023604 Where are we going'?
3024022 3025314 Where?
3025356 3027734 Where I'm going, amigo.
3028484 3030028 Over that way.
3030111 3033573 Another 100 miles of beautiful sunbaked sand.
3034365 3036743 Even the armies are afraid to march through there.
3036826 3039120 Sibley's men are retreating up there.
3039203 3041956 Canby's men are coming here...
3042540 3045960 ...but no one will set foot in this hell...
3046878 3049338 ...except you and me.
3050840 3054052 One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.
3056512 3059640 What was it you told me the last time?
3061100 3065313 "If" you save your breath,<br />I feel a man like you could manage it.
3067106 3070193 And if you won't manage it, you'll die.
3070234 3071778 Only slowly.
3072862 3075323 Very slowly, old friend.
3080620 3083539 After you, please. Start walking.
3199989 3202074 Taking a rest?
3202533 3206913 Come on, Blondie, we don't have<br />very far to go. Only 70 miles.
3208414 3212043 Only eight and a half hours more before sunset.
3212168 3214462 That's not too bad.
3215546 3217340 Come on!
3340588 3342548 And so, Blondie...
3344800 3346844 ...it's goodbye.
3573070 3576699 $200,000 in gold. It's yours. Just get me water!
3582037 3584248 What's that you say?
3584290 3585833 Who the hell are you?
3588210 3590588 My name's Bill Carson now.
3591505 3593090 Surprise attack.
3594925 3595884 All dead.
3595926 3599013 My name is Jackson. Not Carson.
3599388 3601265 Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.
3601348 3604935 I'm Lincoln's grandfather.<br />What was that you said about the dollars?
3605019 3607104 $200,000, all mine.
3608355 3610941 Was the Third Cavalry's.
3611400 3613485 Baker has nothing.
3614069 3615237 The gold...
3615321 3618282 I hid the gold. The gold is safe!
3619033 3620909 Where? Here?
3622202 3623954 Talk!
3624413 3626457 In the cemetery.
3626540 3628542 Which cemetery?
3629585 3631962 On Sad Hill.
3632004 3633839 There's a grave by the...
3634673 3636175 Which grave'?
3636258 3638719 Have a name? Have a number?
3638761 3641180 Come on, you dummy, talk!
3642806 3645100 There's no number.
3645517 3647019 There's a name.
3648187 3650397 It's written.
3656987 3658322 Water!
3661075 3663869 You talk first, eh'? I'll give you the water later!
3663994 3665704 Sad Hill Cemetery, okay?
3665788 3667039 In a grave, okay.
3667122 3669708 But it must have a name or a number on it.
3669792 3672795 There must be 1,000, 5,000, you...!
3676674 3678592 Don't die.
3678634 3681011 Don't die! I'll get you water!
3681136 3684515 Stay there. Don't move, I'll get you water.
3684556 3686934 Don't die until later!
3712668 3713961 Get away from there!
3720509 3722302 He's dead.
3725848 3727641 I'll kill you!
3730060 3733272 If you do that, you'll always be poor.
3734356 3737568 Just like the greasy rat that you are.
3737985 3740154 If I were you, I'd...
3740362 3742030 ...keep me alive.
3742322 3744658 What did he tell you?
3745701 3746869 A name.
3748078 3749913 Name on a grave.
3750164 3751874 What name?
3765596 3767681 Blondie, don't die.
3768766 3771226 Don't die! I'm your friend.
3771477 3775063 Please don't die. Please! I'm your friend!
3778400 3780569 I'll help you. I'll help you!
3780652 3783614 Don't move. I'll be right back. I'll get the water.
3783697 3786158 Don't die like that pig.
3787701 3789369 Water, Blondie?
3789411 3791455 Don't drink! It's no good for you.
3791538 3793457 Feel better?
3793499 3797211 Blondie, what's the matter? Please don't die!
3825948 3827241 I've got a very sick man here.
3827324 3828826 But we have no more beds here.
3828909 3831328 Let him have yours!
3836500 3838794 - Where is Pablo Ramirez?<br />- Padre Ramirez.
3838877 3840546 He is away at the moment.
3840796 3843173 He should be back any day now.
3843257 3847719 It doesn't matter. For the moment,<br />we'll take very good care of my friend.
3847803 3849346 May God be praised.
3849429 3850681 In case you didn't know it...
3850722 3854601 ...God is on our side, too.<br />Because He hates the Yanks.
3856311 3857771 Father, is he still breathing?
3857813 3859940 Yes, of course.
3860607 3862526 You're heavy.
3904359 3907321 All right, put a fresh bandage on him.
3908280 3910532 Put him in my cell.
3915537 3917956 Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.
3918040 3922085 Look out for him, please. He's like a brother to me!
3941063 3943857 Father, did he speak'? Did he say anything'?
3974262 3976932 Did he ask for me? Did he speak about anything?
3976974 3979768 No, he hasn't spoken as yet. But you mustn't worry.
3979810 3983689 He's both young and strong.<br />That's what's kept him going until now.
3983855 3986608 He should regain his strength in a very short time.
3986650 3990904 Thank you, Father. You don't know<br />how much this boy's life means to me!
4069649 4073403 The old Father tells me<br />you'll be up and around in a few days.
4073570 4076948 You're very lucky to have me<br />so close when it happened.
4077282 4079701 Think, if you'd been on your own.
4082037 4083622 I mean, when...
4083705 4086166 ...when one is ill...
4086500 4089961 ...it's good to have somebody close by,<br />friends or relations.
4092005 4093548 Do you...
4093590 4095801 ...you have parents, Blondie?
4096259 4097761 A mother?
4097844 4100097 Not even a mother.
4100847 4102140 No one.
4103058 4105894 You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.
4106561 4109272 We're all alone in the world.
4109356 4111358 I have you, you have me.
4114402 4116780 Only for a little while, I mean.
4117114 4119074 It had to happen now.
4119741 4122244 What a dirty rotten trick of fate!
4122285 4125413 We could have all that money in our hands.
4131795 4134381 I must tell you the truth, Blondie.
4134464 4137676 In my place, you would do the same thing.
4139136 4141388 It's all over for you now.
4142097 4145058 There's nothing anyone can do anymore.
4149187 4151481 It's my fault! Mine, mine!
4164119 4167998 I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.<br />If I knew that my last hour had come...
4168081 4172544 ...I swear, in my place, in your place,<br />I would do the same thing.
4173753 4177048 I would tell about the gold. Yes, yes I would!
4177132 4179593 I would tell the name on the grave.
4179634 4182345 After all, what good is the money to you<br />if you're dead?
4182429 4184514 I know the name of the cemetery.
4184556 4187684 But you know how many graves there are there?
4187767 4188977 Please.
4191062 4193023 Please, have a little.
4196318 4199279 Coffee? Please tell me the name.
4201364 4202908 On the grave.
4203742 4206745 If I get my hands on the $200,000.
4208580 4211166 ...I'll always honor your memory.
4211666 4214794 I swear it! I'll always honor your memory!
4217839 4219799 Come closer.
4224846 4225931 Tell me.
4231519 4233813 I'll sleep better...
4235106 4237692 ...knowing my good friend...
4237943 4239986 ...is by my side...
4240028 4241571 ...to protect me.
4252249 4254584 "Tuco, water. Please, water."
4254709 4258255 But if I get that name from you, I'll give you water!
4265387 4268265 All right, you dirty skunk, get your ass off the bed!
4268306 4270433 Come on, come on, the party's over.
4270517 4272269 The wagon is all ready to go.
4272560 4274521 From the way the wounded<br />are pouring into this place...
4274562 4277649 ...we better get the hell out of here<br />before we get caught up in the war.
4277732 4280568 Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
4280610 4284823 This is something I have to look into.<br />It'll only take a minute. Get moving.
4284948 4286574 - Where? This way?<br />- Yes.
4304384 4305468 Hey, Pablo!
4313977 4316229 Don't you recognize me?
4317772 4319524 It's me, Tuco!
4320066 4322402 Let me embrace you.
4325697 4328658 I don't know the right thing!
4332662 4334956 I was just passing by here. I said to myself...
4335165 4339002 ...I wonder if my brother remembers his brother.
4341421 4343256 Did I do wrong?
4344591 4347218 It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.
4347260 4349554 You've seen me, Tuco.
4351222 4353808 Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.
4359647 4362609 Oh, my uniform. It's a long story.
4363943 4367238 Let's talk about you. It's more important.
4367572 4369407 You look very well.
4369949 4372619 A bit thin, perhaps, but...
4373745 4376706 ...you always were thin, eh Pablito?
4379376 4381461 What about our parents?
4382670 4384964 Only now do you think of them?
4386132 4388176 To begin after nine years?
4390345 4392222 Nine years?
4393515 4394974 So it's nine years.
4398520 4401564 Our mother has been dead a long time now.
4402732 4406069 Our father died only a few days ago.
4406152 4408071 That's why I was away.
4409906 4412325 He asked for you to be there.
4412367 4414702 But there was only me.
4421543 4423586 And you?
4423628 4426756 Outside of evil, what else have you managed to do?
4428133 4431636 It seems to me you once had a wife someplace.
4434055 4436141 Not one, lots of them!
4436182 4438852 One here, one there, wherever I found them.
4440061 4442856 Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
4444566 4446901 What good would that be?
4448153 4450613 Just keep on the way you're going.
4450697 4452157 Go away.
4453575 4454826 The Lord have mercy on your soul.
4454868 4458455 I'll go, I'll go. While I'm waiting<br />for the Lord to remember me...
4458538 4462208 ...l, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother Ramirez...
4462250 4464252 ...will tell you something.
4464335 4466337 You think you're better than I am.
4466421 4469090 Where we came from,<br />if one did not want to die of poverty...
4469132 4471551 ...one became a priest or a bandit!
4471593 4474179 You chose your way, I chose mine.
4474262 4475930 Mine was harder.
4476097 4477849 You talk of our mother and father.
4477891 4480018 You remember when you left to become a priest.
4480101 4481519 I stayed behind!
4481561 4485398 I must have been ten, twelve.<br />I don't remember which, but I stayed.
4485440 4487859 I tried, but it was no good.
4487942 4490111 Now I am going to tell you something.
4490153 4491696 You became a priest because you were...
4491779 4494782 ...too much of a coward to do what I do!
4525313 4527565 Please, forgive me, brother.
4557262 4558930 My belly's full.
4560765 4562725 Nice guy, my brother.
4563059 4565436 I didn't tell you my brother was in charge here.
4565520 4567730 Everything, like the pope almost.
4567772 4569732 He's in charge in Rome.
4569774 4573278 My brother, he says to me:<br />"Stay, brother, don't go home."
4573361 4575154 "We never see each other."
4575196 4579659 "Here, there's plenty to eat and drink.<br />Bring your friend, too."
4579701 4582078 Whenever we see each other, he never lets me go.
4582120 4584539 It's always the same story.
4584581 4587250 My brother, he's crazy about me.
4591087 4592005 That's so.
4592046 4595383 Even a tramp like me, no matter what happens...
4596217 4601723 ...I know there's a brother somewhere<br />who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.
4603099 4604517 Sure.
4605893 4609856 Well, after a meal,<br />there's nothing like a good cigar.
4677840 4679300 Wake up, you!
4679676 4681135 The troops are coming!
4681177 4683221 Blue or gray?
4689977 4694315 They're gray like us. Let's say "hello"<br />to them and then get going.
4694357 4697652 Hurrah for the Confederacy! Hurrah!
4697694 4699779 Down with General Grant!
4699862 4702782 Hurrah for General... what's his name?
4702824 4703866 Lee!
4706744 4710206 God is with us because He hates the Yanks, too!
4711958 4715753 God is not on our side 'cause He hates idiots also.
4735606 4737233 Prisoners of war...
4737316 4739026 forward...
4739902 4741112 ...march!
4803925 4806177 Form a single file.
4865945 4867572 Robert Clark.
4867655 4868906 Present.
4869824 4871117 Sam Richmond.
4871158 4872410 Present.
4875538 4876998 Bill Carson.
4883296 4885298 I said Bill Carson!
4886090 4889010 Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?
4889510 4892763 All right, what's he doing? Sleeping?!
4895641 4898811 Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.
4901814 4903232 That's me!
4911532 4913701 Please, Carson.
4914869 4916621 Answer, "Present"!
4918247 4920416 What are you, deaf'?
4926088 4929050 Now, suppose you say "present," Carson.
4930468 4933387 I like big fat men like you.
4933429 4935848 When they fall, they make more noise.
4935890 4938476 And sometimes they never get up.
4939393 4941270 Wallace...
4942772 4944523 ...that's enough.
4947151 4948986 Sergeant!
4950529 4953532 The captain wants to see you right away.
4956452 4959288 Be sure these two get good treatment.
4969382 4973010 Hey, Blondie, did you hear that? Good treatment!
4979934 4982436 For the last time, sergeant...
4982478 4983604 ...I'm telling you...
4983646 4986732 ...I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.
4987483 4989276 No more brutality!
4990403 4994198 There's hundreds of prisoners out there<br />and only a few men to guard them.
4994281 4996617 What am I supposed to do? I have to have respect!
4996659 5001497 I think that you'll manage to gain<br />their respect by treating them better!
5002873 5005459 Are our men treated that well in Andersonville Camp?
5005543 5008337 I don't give a goddamn what they do in Andersonville!
5008379 5010715 While I'm in charge here,<br />the prisoners are not to be...
5010798 5011924 tortured...
5011966 5013676 ...or cheated...
5013968 5015594 ...or murdered!
5015886 5017680 Is that an accusation?
5017763 5021100 Sergeant, gangrene is eating my leg away...
5021892 5023519 ...not my eyes.
5023602 5026689 I know the prisoners here are being<br />robbed systematically.
5026772 5030609 I know there's scum around,<br />or bivouacked near the camp, waiting...
5030651 5033571 ...for someone to deliver this loot.
5033654 5037408 But as long as I'm commandant,<br />I won't permit any such trickery!
5037450 5039035 Am I clear?
5040828 5042163 Yes, sir.
5042329 5045416 Just as long as you're the commandant.
5046500 5048044 Yes, sergeant.
5050921 5054258 I know this leg means I won't last very long...
5054341 5057219 ...but I pray I can manage to have enough time...
5057261 5062266 ...to amass evidence and bring to a<br />court-martial all those who discredit...
5062975 5065561 ...and dishonor the uniform...
5065811 5067521 ...of the Union!
5071734 5073444 I wish you luck.
5108062 5110940 You and the others better lay low for a few days.
5112233 5115820 I'll keep this. You go. Wallace will let you know.
5128249 5130709 - Bring me Carson.<br />- Right.
5145266 5148269 Angel Eyes said for us to lay low for a few days.
5148561 5151605 But we'll keep close enough to keep an eye on things.
5151981 5153941 Come on, saddle your horses.
5164660 5166036 Come on in, Tuco.
5166787 5168289 Don't be bashful.
5169206 5171500 There's no formalities here.
5182803 5184763 It's been a long time!
5188392 5189602 You're hungry.
5190603 5192271 Sit down. Eat!
5211707 5213500 I knew it, I knew it!
5215336 5217504 The minute I saw you, I said to myself:
5218631 5221050 "Look at that pig, Angel Eyes..."
5222468 5224929 "...I'll bet he's got himself an easy job!"
5228265 5230267 "And he never forgets a friend!"
5231143 5233270 I never forget old friends, Tuco.
5237233 5239193 It's good to see old friends again.
5242488 5245157 Especially when they come from so far away...
5245908 5248202 ...and have so much to talk about.
5249703 5252581 And you do have a lot to talk about, haven't you?
5255209 5256835 You were captured near...
5257211 5258254 ...Fort Craig?
5263092 5265844 If you were with Sibley, then you were...
5266762 5268472 ...coming from Santa Fe?
5281068 5282945 Was it hard crossing the desert?
5283779 5284822 Very hard!
5286699 5289285 Especially if you don't have anything to drink.
5291996 5294915 Why are you going under the name of Bill Carson, now?
5300629 5302923 One name is as good as another.
5303382 5305384 Not wise to use your own name.
5306427 5309805 Like you, I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.
5310889 5312766 Sergeant Angel Eyes.
5321817 5324111 Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?
5324945 5325946 Music?
5326530 5329575 Yes, very good for the digestion.
5345132 5347217 Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
5353265 5354808 That fake, too'?
5356560 5359021 Bill Carson's name is written on it.
5360731 5362066 Have some.
5362900 5364943 It's Bill Carson's tobacco.
5448861 5451655 Was Carson dead or alive when you found him?
5458120 5460247 What'd he tell you about the money?
5464293 5466545 I don't know what you're talking about!
5484521 5486315 More feeling.
5504583 5507878 You can sure consider yourself<br />much luckier than your pal.
5508337 5511298 Wallace will punch your friend<br />as long as the song goes.
5511340 5514092 So many of us have had a session in there.
5535656 5537658 How's your digestion now?
5541662 5543205 You'd better talk.
5543497 5545707 I have nothing to tell you!
5573443 5575070 Play that fiddle, you!
5619740 5621783 I'll talk!
5631668 5633920 What did he say about the money?
5638800 5640427 It's buried in a grave.
5641595 5642679 Where?
5645724 5647643 At the Sad Hill Cemetery.
5649936 5651688 Which grave'?
5651980 5653523 I don't know!
5657486 5658820 Blondie...
5661740 5664284 ...he knows the name of the grave.
5680759 5682386 The war's over for you.
5686139 5687766 Put those clothes on.
5692229 5693647 Why?
5693980 5695941 We're going for a ride.
5696983 5697776 Where?
5698110 5700445 To find $200,000.
5701488 5703740 I know the name of the cemetery now...
5704574 5706952 ...and you know the name of the grave.
5727013 5729975 You're not going to give me the same treatment?
5733729 5735063 Would you talk?
5736440 5738525 No, probably not.
5740068 5741695 That's what I thought.
5742612 5744406 Not that you are any tougher than Tuco...
5744865 5747909 ...but you're smart enough to know<br />that talking won't save you.
5751955 5754875 And Tuco, is he?
5757210 5759254 No, not yet...
5760547 5762507 ...but he's in very good hands.
5764050 5767012 You changed partners,<br />but you still got the same deal.
5767345 5769931 I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
5771349 5772684 There's two of us.
5773059 5775562 It should make it easier than just one.
5801505 5803715 Hold it. That's it.
5804257 5805383 Don't move.
5806384 5807844 Don't breathe.
5811556 5813266 Got it. Thank you.
5829407 5832786 Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost'?<br />Where's the Rebel going?
5833078 5835747 To hell with a rope around his neck<br />and a price on his head.
5835789 5838291 Yeah, $3,000, friend.
5838834 5840919 That's a lot of money for a head.
5842128 5845006 I bet they didn't even pay you a penny for your arm.
5851304 5854391 I told you once, but if I ever get you down...
5854933 5857394 ...you're gonna need a lot of help to get up again.
5877706 5879916 You're a lot luckier than that one there.
5880000 5882586 You get some proper rope, and you're all finished.
5882669 5885672 And there isn't any partner, this time,<br />to shoot you down.
5910363 5911573 Get up!
5997951 6000453 Sure would like to put your paw on it, huh?
6002747 6004708 I would like to piss, it's rough.
6004916 6007502 I've been shaken up in this train<br />nearly ten hours now.
6007544 6009629 You smell like a pig already!
6010463 6012966 Let's try not to make things any worse.
6015385 6016803 Get goin'
6025979 6028773 I can't while you're watching me.
6052005 6054799 You made a lot of noise my friend, huh?
6075695 6077655 You don't wanna break our friendship, huh?
6077697 6079240 Well, I'll break it!
6221674 6223760 Clemens, take care of the horses.
6480266 6482894 I've been looking for you for eight months!
6483936 6486814 Whenever I should have had a gun in my right hand...
6487064 6488274 ...I thought of you!
6488608 6491777 Now I find you in exactly the position that suits me.
6492612 6496532 I had lots of time to learn<br />how to shoot with my left.
6512381 6514675 When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk.
6518554 6521182 Every gun makes its own tune...
6521724 6523976 ...and it's perfect timing, large one.
6542453 6544705 Clem, follow him.
6601721 6604056 Just a minute. I'll be right there.
6604849 6607935 Just give me a little time to get dressed,<br />and I'll open up.
6628831 6631542 Put your drawers on, and take your gun off.
6644680 6647391 How the hell did you get out of that pigsty?
6648851 6652730 My own way. I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.
6653814 6656692 You talked, you traitor! You talked!
6657652 6659278 No, I didn't talk.
6659862 6662531 If I did, I probably wouldn't be here, now.
6666744 6669080 So, only you know your half of the secret?
6676337 6678589 I'm very happy you are working with me!
6678881 6680341 And we're together again.
6680841 6683177 I'll get dressed, I kill him, and be right back.
6683260 6685888 Listen, I forgot to mention.
6688724 6691310 He's not alone. There's five of 'em.
6693771 6695981 - Five?<br />- Yeah, five of 'em.
6699318 6701570 So, that's why you came to Tuco.
6705157 6707743 It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all!
6719505 6721465 They shot him at close range.
6741193 6742862 Well, look who's here!
6743446 6745156 The other one will be along.
6748075 6750035 They'll come looking for us.
6751662 6752997 Watch out!
6754248 6755875 There's two of them.
6757251 6759420 I want that blond alive!
6768179 6771307 You back there. Come on, let's go!
6805633 6807760 Were you going to die alone?
6946148 6947608 Angel Eyes is mine.
6948108 6949360 All right.
6989024 6990943 "See you soon."
6993612 6994571 "Idiots."
6996407 6997616 It's for you.
7022683 7024852 How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
7025769 7028022 Like a cemetery, for instance?
7029523 7031817 There should be a bridge across that river.
7032609 7034153 We better wait for nightfall.
7034194 7035863 Trust in me, Blondie.
7039199 7041076 I got a good sense of where I'm going.
7041160 7044079 Tuco has taken you this far,<br />I will take you all the way...
7050210 7051962 - Tell the captain.<br />- Yes, sir.
7053338 7055799 Come along now. Follow me.
7102429 7104890 We found them near the perimeter, sir.
7119446 7121281 Where do you hail from?
7121824 7123158 Illinois.
7125619 7126912 And you?
7128288 7135586 I'm with him.
7135587 7137673 Your reason for being around here?
7138799 7141260 We want to enlist, general!
7144263 7146431 You'd better learn to distinguish rank.
7146807 7148183 I'm a captain!
7150144 7151562 Get the hell out!
7153438 7156650 It sure as hell might be you today,<br />so go write your will.
7163031 7164992 So, you want to enlist.
7166160 7168287 You got to take a test to prove it.
7177880 7179339 Well, show me.
7203280 7207492 You've got a career.<br />At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel!
7207659 7209161 - Really?<br />- Sure!
7210495 7212206 Like it says in the manual.
7212706 7216960 You've got every qualification<br />to become expert in the use of weapons.
7218337 7222049 This is the most potent weapon in war!
7225302 7227429 The fighting spirit is in this bottle!
7229765 7231350 Volunteers...
7233477 7235437 You want to enlist?
7236730 7237814 Then let's go.
7242903 7245072 The shooting hasn't begun yet.
7246281 7250160 Yes, because soon you can join<br />the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.
7252204 7255582 - We have two attacks a day.<br />- Two attacks a day?
7255916 7256875 Sure.
7257042 7260963 The Reb's have decided that damn bridge<br />is the key to this whole area.
7262756 7264925 Stupid, useless bridge.
7265676 7268220 A flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
7270055 7274685 And headquarters has declared that<br />we must take that ridiculous flyspeck...
7276436 7278230 ...even if all of us are killed.
7278647 7282734 Otherwise, the key'll get rusty<br />and just be a spot on the wall.
7284403 7285737 And that's not all.
7286405 7288782 Both sides want the bridge intact!
7289074 7293078 Intact is how the South wants it.<br />And we want it intact, too.
7296206 7299876 You'll all turn to dust,<br />but one thing is sure, boys...
7300794 7303630 ...Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.
7305007 7306091 Is it bad...
7306466 7308885 ...to speak the way I do to volunteers?
7310345 7312264 I've done a lot worse.
7316852 7318895 I've done it. I've blown it up...
7321481 7324735 ...in here. I've destroyed it all.
7325610 7328989 It's a court-martial offense to imagine--<br />to dream of blowing it up.
7329031 7330741 A serious crime.
7331116 7334786 Even to think of destroying that bridge is just...
7338123 7340417 Why not really blow it up, captain?
7341960 7345380 Yeah, captain, it's nothing.<br />Let's scare the hell out of them!
7348800 7350927 I've been dreaming about it.
7354598 7356641 I've even worked out a plan.
7358268 7359811 I sure have!
7360896 7363690 The best time is after the attack...
7364191 7366943 ...when there's a truce to get the wounded.
7368111 7369321 If I could do it...
7370280 7372324 ...I could save many thousands of men.
7378413 7380332 But what I lack is the guts.
7386546 7389466 They're beginning the daily slaughter, right on time.
7389841 7392552 Captain! All companies are awaiting your orders.
7393345 7394930 I'll be right there.
7410695 7411988 All right, friends...
7412614 7414783 ...come along and enjoy the spectacle.
7446231 7447274 Companies!
7447691 7448733 Report!
7449025 7451236 <i>(Company B, read)‚Äù</i>
7488356 7491943 It looks like the captain is really asking<br />for a bullet in his guts!
7545789 7549084 I've never seen so many men wasted so badly.
7569688 7573233 I've a feeling it's really gonna be<br />a good long battle.
7579698 7582075 The money is on the other side of the river.
7583743 7584703 Where?
7587539 7590542 Amigo, I said on the other side. That's enough.
7591626 7594671 But while the Confederates are there,<br />we can't get across.
7596381 7600385 What would happen<br />if somebody were to blow up that bridge?
7604014 7606725 Then these idiots would go somewhere else to fight!
7607559 7608685 Maybe.
7646806 7649601 Doctor, quick! The captain's wounded!
7652103 7653897 Hurry, a stretcher!
7656274 7657942 Easy, now.
7668828 7670455 Get things ready.
7691476 7692977 A little of this will help.
7699901 7701820 Take a slug of this, captain...
7702362 7704364 ...and keep your ears open.
7753163 7754247 What're you doing?
7856975 7859853 You realize we might be risking our lives?
7861396 7865358 If I get killed, you'll never get your hands<br />on all that beautiful money.
7868570 7870488 It sure would be a pity.
7906316 7908443 Can you help me live a little more?
7909152 7910904 I expect good news.
7924208 7927045 Why don't we tell each other our half of the secret?
7927545 7929505 Why don't we?
7931049 7932342 You go first.
7934677 7937180 No, I think it's better that...
7939641 7940975 ...you start.
7945229 7946230 All right.
7949025 7951402 The name of the cemetery is...
7969295 7971422 ...Sad Hill! Now it's your turn!
7979764 7981557 The name on the grave is...
7986270 7987605 ...Arch Stanton.
7989857 7990942 Arch Stanton?
7991651 7992944 Are you sure'?
7994112 7995780 Sure, I'm sure.
8701110 8703153 It'd be a lot easier with that.
8743736 8745946 Two can dig a lot quicker than one.
8746613 8747698 Dig!
8750826 8752453 You're not digging?
8764715 8767426 If you shoot me, you won't see a cent of that money.
8770220 8771096 Why?
8774224 8775601 I'll tell you why.
8776810 8778479 'Cause there's nothin' in there.
8788906 8790657 You thought I'd trust you?
8793911 8796288 $200,000 is a lot of money.
8797956 8799708 We're gonna have to earn it.
8803462 8804171 How?
8816016 8818560 I'll write the name on the bottom of this stone.
8822731 8823690 The gun?
9190473 9194561 You pig! You wanted to get me killed?<br />When'd you unload it?
9196646 9197772 Last night.
9199107 9202652 You see, in this world there's two kinds<br />of people, my friend...
9203820 9207449 ...those with loaded guns, and those who dig.
9208575 9209743 You dig.
