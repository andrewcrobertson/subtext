44373 46580 <i>Hello. I'm Richard Schickel.</i>
46667 54506 <i>I will be doing the commentary on this<br />extended English-language version -</i>
54592 61464 <i>the first that comes close to the Italian<br />version that Sergio Leone originally made.</i>
62517 65430 <i>It was truncated for its American release</i>
65520 72392 <i>and is now restored -<br />as extensively as is possible -</i>
72485 76068 <i>to the director's original intention.</i>
77864 85864 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly<br /><i>was produced in Italy and Spain in 1966.</i>
88125 94713 <i>It was a film that did not get released<br />in the United States until two years later,</i>
94798 99634 <i>when United Artists acquired the film</i>
99719 106762 <i>and decided to put out it<br />and two predecessors,</i>
106852 111562 For a Few Dollars <i>and</i><br />A Few Dollars More, <i>as a group of films,</i>
111648 115983 <i>and they, of course, invented,<br />as probably everybody knows,</i>
116069 122031 <i>the conceit that the Clint Eastwood<br />character was consistent in all three films</i>
122117 125279 <i>and was the Man With No Name.</i>
125369 130079 <i>Again, as everybody knows,<br />he has a name in all three of the films.</i>
130166 132407 <i>In this particular film</i>
132501 134833 <i>[CHUCKLING] he's called Blondie,</i>
134920 138834 <i>although he is, of course,<br />not particularly a blond fellow.</i>
138924 146924 <i>And the film was, I think,<br />a way station for Sergio Leone -</i>
148434 153224 <i>in other words, the two earlier films<br />he'd done with Eastwood</i>
153314 159481 <i>had been, relatively speaking, modestly<br />budgeted, particularly the first one,</i>
159570 163905 <i>for which Clint, I think,<br />received a salary of $15, 000,</i>
163991 167780 <i>which, even by the standards of that day,<br />was relatively low.</i>
167870 172740 <i>They had become enormously<br />successful films in Europe,</i>
172833 176826 <i>but there had been problems<br />about releasing it in the United States,</i>
176920 181960 <i>in particular the first one,<br />which was a knock-off of</i> Yojimbo,
182634 184591 <i>the Kurosawa film.</i>
184677 192016 <i>So this is a film that is much more epic<br />in scope than the previous films.</i>
192101 196595 <i>And I think this very first shot,<br />or the first sequence of shots,</i>
196689 202480 <i>is just a typically Leone deal.</i>
202570 206188 <i>In other words, he was a director<br />whose most characteristic trait</i>
206282 211448 <i>was the alternation<br />of tight close-ups like this one</i>
211537 214825 <i>with extremely wide shots.</i>
218127 224544 <i>It gave his films a kind of<br />an interesting operatic quality.</i>
224633 232633 <i>And I do believe that a lot<br />of the basic setting of this kind of work,</i>
235435 237517 <i>the close-ups and the long shots,</i>
237604 241518 <i>I think drew on something<br />that people don't know too much about,</i>
241608 245943 <i>which is that Leone<br />was a rather devoted art collector</i>
246029 252526 <i>and was aping styles<br />he particularly liked.</i>
252619 256658 <i>The close-ups have a Goya-esque quality.</i>
256748 262118 <i>The wide shots, particularly<br />in these bleak desert landscapes,</i>
262212 265921 <i>owe a fair amount to surrealism,</i>
266008 274008 <i>one of the visual specialties of which was<br />these extremely bleak, wide landscapes</i>
275099 280970 <i>with grotesque and often inappropriate<br />figures placed in them.</i>
281063 288106 <i>So this was something that<br />hasn't been particularly commented upon</i>
288195 295283 <i>in such critical work<br />as there has been on Leone.</i>
295369 300705 <i>And I think it's important - it's something<br />he did in the very first films</i>
300791 304910 <i>and something he does<br />a great deal of in this film.</i>
306630 309497 <i>It is part of his uniqueness as a director,</i>
309592 314211 <i>which, again, is something that was not<br />particularly commented upon at the time.</i>
314305 319971 <i>People were much more interested<br />in the violence of his movies,</i>
320061 327023 <i>which, by the standards of the day,<br />that is the standards of the mid-'60s,</i>
327108 331523 <i>seemed to them<br />particularly vivid and off-putting</i>
331613 337905 <i>to genteel Americans<br />when the pictures came out.</i>
343792 351792 <i>The Eli Wallach character is, by Leone's<br />standards, kind of a new element.</i>
357889 361974 <i>The humor of the character,<br />the wildness of the character -</i>
362060 366600 <i>he's obviously dispensed with the four<br />or five guys who came in to kill him here -</i>
369401 371483 <i>is new to Leone.</i>
371569 376688 <i>And the humor of it is often grotesque,</i>
376782 384075 <i>but also a unique, new element<br />in Leone's storytelling.</i>
388502 391540 <i>This film was kind of spitballed<br />into existence</i>
391630 398252 <i>by Leone's screenwriting collaborator,<br />Luciano Vincenzoni,</i>
398345 404557 <i>who took a bunch of United Artists<br />executives to a screening in Rome</i>
404643 407476 <i>of</i> For a Few Dollars More.
408188 413183 <i>And it was a packed house,<br />an enthusiastic house,</i>
413277 417612 <i>and these guys walked out<br />and said "Wow."</i>
417698 422443 <i>"We'd like to buy this, we'd like to buy<br />the previous one, and have you got more?"</i>
422536 428076 <i>And Vincenzoni just said<br />"Yeah, there's a story we want to do."</i>
428166 433582 <i>"It's about three guys<br />who are in pursuit of a chest of gold."</i>
433671 438290 <i>And that's about what he had<br />at that point,</i>
438384 444426 <i>and Leone, I think, at the point didn't<br />even know that he had proposed this notion.</i>
444515 448634 <i>So the upshot was<br />a much more expensive picture -</i>
448728 453097 <i>this picture ultimately cost<br />about $1.2 million,</i>
453191 457276 <i>as opposed to a few hundred thousand<br />for the first one.</i>
457361 465361 <i>It does bring back Lee Van Cleef playing<br />"The Ugly" in this particular movie.</i>
467830 474542 <i>This is a shot - or this whole sequence<br />here - that is worth commenting upon.</i>
474628 478872 <i>Clint Eastwood said of Leone<br />that he was like a child</i>
478965 485507 <i>when he looked at sets and locales,</i>
485597 491388 <i>because when we're kids<br />we see the house we live in</i>
491478 498100 <i>as much larger<br />than it actually is in reality.</i>
498193 500605 <i>Then when we go back as adults<br />and visit it,</i>
500695 505440 <i>we're always amazed at how small it is<br />in comparison to our memories.</i>
505534 510370 <i>Clint said that he felt<br />Leone saw all of life that way,</i>
510455 518455 <i>that he continued to show these settings<br />with the eye of a child,</i>
520131 523543 <i>in that they are much larger<br />than reality would dictate.</i>
523634 531634 <i>For example, this sort of peasant's home<br />in the wilds of wherever we are</i>
534728 542351 <i>is much larger than it would be<br />in whatever reality this movie referred to.</i>
544029 545565 <i>I think that's a good point.</i>
545656 552028 <i>I think that partly accounts<br />for his predilection for big, wide shots</i>
552121 559539 <i>and the scope of Leone's vision<br />in these pictures.</i>
561505 568423 <i>Lee Van Cleef was, as you know,<br />a veteran actor, particularly in westerns.</i>
568512 574427 <i>He'd worked a lot with John Ford - he's<br />notable for his appearance in</i> High Noon.
574517 576679 <i>He's a striking-looking man,</i>
576769 583516 <i>who'd had some troubles<br />and had been kind of out of the movies</i>
583610 587569 <i>until Leone hired him<br />for a much more sympathetic,</i>
587655 592821 <i>and actually wonderful character<br />in</i> For a Few Dollars More.
592910 596653 <i>He wasn't necessarily<br />Leone's first choice for this part,</i>
596748 600161 <i>but Clint Eastwood liked him a lot.</i>
600251 605667 <i>They'd worked together on Clint's</i><br />Rawhide <i>television program,</i>
605757 610376 <i>he'd found him an extremely agreeable<br />co-star in the previous picture,</i>
610470 613258 <i>so he encouraged Leone<br />to bring him back.</i>
613348 617182 <i>And he's very very fine in this movie.</i>
617268 624890 <i>He is, without doubt,<br />one of the most implacably evil figures</i>
624983 627850 <i>ever to appear on a movie screen.</i>
627944 630311 <i>There is no softness in this man.</i>
630405 636902 <i>There is no nostalgic memory<br />operating in him.</i>
636995 639407 <i>He is a killing machine,</i>
639498 644243 <i>and he is a machine<br />that is determined at all costs</i>
644336 650048 <i>to achieve this box of gold.</i>
650133 653671 <i>And what's going on in this scene</i>
653762 659883 <i>has to do with his search for a man<br />who may know where the gold is hidden,</i>
659976 665813 <i>and this peasant knows more<br />than he wishes to talk about.</i>
665899 672611 <i>And I think,<br />as is so often the case with Leone,</i>
672697 679319 <i>we know, almost from the moment<br />Van Cleef makes his entrance,</i>
679412 686250 <i>that the man eating his chili over there<br />has not got long to live,</i>
686335 692707 <i>unless he accedes to<br />Van Cleef's demands for information.</i>
707815 715529 <i>It's a scene that foreshadows much of the<br />brutality that will ensue in this movie.</i>
715614 722781 <i>And it certainly foreshadows<br />almost everything we need to know</i>
722871 725579 <i>about Van Cleef's character.</i>
729961 732578 <i>Another thing to point out in this scene,</i>
732672 740591 <i>because, again, it's a characteristic<br />Leone moment, or extended moment,</i>
740680 748680 <i>for a man who became notorious for the, I<br />think, exaggerated violence in his films -</i>
751983 754475 <i>that is, it was exaggerated by the critics,</i>
754569 758153 <i>I don't find them all that violent,<br />honestly speaking...</i>
758239 761823 <i>But the whole point<br />about violence in Leone movies</i>
761910 767747 <i>is that it takes a long, long, long time<br />for it to arrive.</i>
768750 775337 <i>There's always a lot of talk,<br />there's always a lot of silent exchanges</i>
775422 779962 <i>between the people who are<br />going to perpetrate this violence.</i>
780052 784171 <i>Then, when the violence arrives,<br />it tends to go very quickly.</i>
784264 788974 <i>And it is, I think, the opposite</i>
789061 795808 <i>of what was then the prevailing style<br />of western violence,</i>
795901 801237 <i>which was established<br />in the United States by Sam Peckinpah,</i>
801323 809323 <i>where the act of violence was extended<br />by Peckinpah's use of slow motion,</i>
809790 813909 <i>of blood squibs exploding in slow motion,</i>
814002 820214 <i>the length of time - as another western<br />director, Howard Hawks, said at the time -</i>
820300 824964 <i>the length of time it took between<br />the moment the bullet hit the victim</i>
825054 829173 <i>and the moment the victim hit the ground.</i>
829267 831634 <i>It's the opposite with Leone.</i>
831727 835345 <i>He does an enormous amount of-</i>
836232 840351 <i>what shall we say, foreplay?<br />-before the moment comes,</i>
840444 848444 <i>but when the moment comes<br />it tends to be brutal and quick and over.</i>
849287 855579 <i>So I don't know that you can make<br />a particular aesthetic choice</i>
855668 860208 <i>between the two methods<br />of presenting death on the screen.</i>
860298 864917 <i>I think my own preference<br />is for Leone's style.</i>
865970 869838 <i>I mean, this scene<br />has been going on a very long time</i>
869932 874266 <i>before it reaches the moment<br />we've just seen here.</i>
890785 895279 <i>Again, that's a very typical<br />Leone moment there.</i>
896374 901494 <i>Generally speaking,<br />no distinction is particularly made</i>
901588 904671 <i>between people<br />who may or may not deserve to die</i>
904758 908251 <i>and people who really<br />don't deserve to die,</i>
910722 914090 <i>but do in the accidental exchange<br />of gunfire and so forth.</i>
922900 929112 <i>Now, in this particular sequence<br />Van Cleef has succeeded in his mission.</i>
929198 932236 <i>He has additional information,</i>
932326 937412 <i>but his employer in this story</i>
941210 946876 <i>also is a man who,<br />the moment we begin this encounter,</i>
946966 949833 <i>we know is not going<br />to live very long either</i>
949927 957141 <i>because Van Cleef is going to take over<br />this particular criminal activity.</i>
957226 961060 <i>He's not going to go on working<br />for someone else</i>
961146 964514 <i>who will take the lion's share of the loot.</i>
966819 971654 <i>So this establishment<br />of the Van Cleef character</i>
971739 979739 <i>as a kind of baseline of evil - of badness,<br />if you will, referring to the film's title -</i>
981666 988288 <i>takes a considerable amount of time<br />to get set up in the film.</i>
988381 993592 <i>And I think that's another thing<br />to mention about Leone.</i>
993678 1000050 <i>Basically, with the exception<br />of certain epic westerns -</i>
1000143 1007015 Shane <i>would be an example of<br />a western that has scope and scale to it -</i>
1007108 1013775 <i>but westerns are essentially,<br />if not necessarily a B-picture product,</i>
1013865 1018610 <i>but they are a lowlife product<br />in the history of cinema.</i>
1018703 1026702 <i>And Leone's manner of taking<br />all the time he needs to tell his tale</i>
1030380 1038380 <i>and to allow scenes to play at great length<br />excessive length, really</i>
1038930 1044346 <i>represents, I think,<br />something new in westerns.</i>
1044436 1051308 <i>One of the things that Clint Eastwood said<br />about working for Leone</i>
1053111 1061111 <i>is that he felt westerns of the '50s and<br />'60s had become state and cliché-ridden,</i>
1062913 1067123 <i>and one of the things<br />that just utterly delighted him</i>
1067209 1071998 <i>was that Leone was attempting<br />to re-imagine the western.</i>
1072088 1079552 <i>And if that entailed taking<br />a good deal of time to work them out,</i>
1079637 1086350 <i>If that entailed this kind of large-scale</i><br />mise en scène, <i>as the French would say,</i>
1086435 1088847 <i>well, so be it.</i>
1088938 1094308 <i>And there was a delight that I think Clint,<br />particularly in the first two movies,</i>
1094401 1102401 <i>took in working with a man<br />who was attempting to take the western</i>
1103619 1108614 <i>in new and operatic directions.</i>
1113504 1121422 <i>Here is Mr. Eastwood's<br />introduction to the film.</i>
1121511 1126756 <i>He has... The one thing he carried<br />through all his three Leone films</i>
1126850 1129558 <i>were those noxious little cigars.</i>
1129644 1134013 <i>Clint is not a smoker,<br />and he told me once</i>
1134107 1140524 <i>that he had deliberately chosen the most<br />offensive cigars to chew on and smoke</i>
1140613 1146154 <i>because he said it put him<br />in a really scratchy mood,</i>
1146244 1152786 <i>suitable to his character for these shots.</i>
1152876 1156244 <i>I mean, those are really bad cigars,</i>
1156337 1164176 <i>which he bought in Los Angeles at a cigar<br />store somewhere around Fairfax Avenue.</i>
1167974 1173844 <i>By the time they were making this picture,</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,
1173937 1179023 <i>I think Clint was to a degree<br />disaffected from Leone.</i>
1179109 1182397 <i>He'd had a good time<br />with the earlier pictures.</i>
1182487 1189609 <i>He'd enjoyed Leone,<br />who was a colorful and active director -</i>
1191955 1197200 <i>about as far from the taciturn character<br />Clint was playing as it's possible to get,</i>
1197294 1202289 <i>in that he was excitable and funny.</i>
1202382 1207127 <i>And, of course, had little or no English,<br />and Clint had little or no Italian,</i>
1207221 1215221 <i>so their communication<br />tended to be in a miming sort of mode.</i>
1216271 1222232 <i>The set-up here, of course,<br />is that Clint is playing a bounty hunter,</i>
1222318 1229566 <i>and he keeps bringing in -<br />this is only the first time -</i>
1232495 1237035 <i>ugly little Eli Wallach,<br />turning him in for the reward</i>
1237124 1241459 <i>and then, as we'll shortly see,</i>
1243881 1249251 <i>working it out so that Tuco does not die<br />as a result of being brought in</i>
1249345 1256559 <i>and they collect and split the reward<br />that Blondie receives</i>
1256644 1263437 <i>for this bounty scam that they're running.</i>
1300687 1307480 <i>In the earlier films - in particular<br />the first one,</i> Fistful of Dollars -
1307569 1311779 <i>Clint had had in the script<br />a great deal more dialogue,</i>
1311865 1317406 <i>and one of the discussions<br />he persistently had with Leone</i>
1317495 1321408 <i>was to do less dialogue.</i>
1323250 1325708 <i>It wasn't that he didn't feel<br />he could carry the dialogue,</i>
1325794 1332712 <i>he just felt that this character was better<br />realized as an essentially silent guy -</i>
1332801 1337716 <i>almost parodying the silence<br />of the classic western hero,</i>
1337806 1339797 <i>going back to William S Hart,</i>
1339892 1343305 <i>who, of course, couldn't talk<br />because he was in silent pictures.</i>
1343395 1350563 <i>But the convention that the hero<br />does not speak a great deal in westerns</i>
1350652 1353019 <i>is more than maintained in these films.</i>
1357159 1361869 <i>On the other hand, Clint also argued...</i>
1361955 1364413 <i>This, by the way, is a classic moment -</i>
1364500 1372499 <i>the moment of the puff of smoke and<br />the appearance of the Man With No Name.</i>
1375635 1383635 <i>He's a kind of classic ironist of the West<br />in this film - and in the others to a degree.</i>
1384811 1387428 <i>Even though he's technically the hero,</i>
1387522 1393894 <i>he's also a kind of commentator<br />on the life that he's participating in.</i>
1395738 1397945 <i>The business of shooting off hats</i>
1398032 1401821 <i>is something that Leone<br />had used in previous films,</i>
1401911 1406576 <i>and was a way of establishing</i>
1408334 1412328 <i>the eptitude, if you will,<br />of the Clint character.</i>
1414424 1422423 <i>Eli Wallach is a new sort of a figure<br />for a Leone film.</i>
1422639 1429511 <i>He was - and is - a very distinguished<br />New York actor,</i>
1429604 1434690 <i>an actor who had rich experience<br />with the Actors Studio.</i>
1434776 1442776 <i>He had, prior to this film,<br />been in a number of terrific movies</i>
1444995 1448158 <i>like Elia Kazan's</i> Baby Doll.
1452252 1457338 <i>He played a character not unlike<br />this character, although even more evil,</i>
1457424 1459665 <i>in</i> The Magnificent Seven.
1459759 1467759 <i>Was a little bit afraid of typecasting as<br />this kind of an ethnic figure, if you will.</i>
1469810 1477810 <i>But Eli is a man<br />of terrific spirit and energy,</i>
1479570 1483609 <i>and even today, in his eighties,</i>
1484241 1486733 <i>is a wonderfully colorful character.</i>
1486827 1493790 <i>He said a wonderful thing about<br />this figure he's playing in this film.</i>
1493876 1499417 <i>He said "Sergio let me have my way<br />with that little guy",</i>
1499507 1503717 <i>and that's certainly a true thing.</i>
1503802 1510720 <i>I don't think there's any particular<br />restraint put on Wallach's character,</i>
1510809 1518352 <i>and it makes for a lot<br />of energy in the picture,</i>
1518442 1522776 <i>and it is the central energy<br />of the picture, I think.</i>
1522862 1530862 <i>Everything that's sort of lively<br />and most human in the picture</i>
1530995 1538163 <i>centers on Eli's character,<br />who's very ambiguously portrayed.</i>
1539212 1542625 <i>This is a nice little sequence here -</i>
1542715 1550715 <i>the attaining of information from<br />this legless veteran of the major killing</i>
1551766 1558763 <i>that is going on all around the central<br />story of the pursuit of this gold.</i>
1559274 1567274 <i>This is the first introduction of what is,<br />I think, the major theme of the movie:</i>
1568324 1576323 <i>that although these guys are pursuing<br />their own narrow, private, evil interests,</i>
1576707 1580496 <i>it's a very small crime</i>
1580586 1588129 <i>next to the crime that preoccupies<br />and finally takes over the movie,</i>
1588218 1593884 <i>which is the mass<br />killing of the Civil War -</i>
1593974 1601974 <i>which Leone imagined having a larger<br />presence in the Texas of this moment</i>
1603859 1605941 <i>than it actually did historically.</i>
1606028 1610738 <i>There was some combat in Texas<br />between the North and the South,</i>
1610824 1613737 <i>but it was relatively minor<br />compared to the combat</i>
1613827 1617286 <i>that later in the picture<br />Leone will show us.</i>
1637975 1642970 <i>An uncharacteristic miss by Blondie<br />in that particular sequence.</i>
1643064 1645897 <i>And it's...</i>
1649862 1653856 <i>This is a scene where<br />Clint did the stunt, but urged Eli,</i>
1653949 1659570 <i>who he took under his wing<br />on this first Italian-western shoot</i>
1659664 1661621 <i>that Eli had ever done,</i>
1661707 1668170 <i>urged Eli to use a stunt double<br />on that sequence. And he did.</i>
1668255 1673966 <i>And Clint by this time,<br />this was his third "spaghetti western" -</i>
1675220 1682468 <i>which is just a simple term<br />for an Italian version of a western,</i>
1682560 1688806 <i>of a particularly and peculiarly<br />American genre -</i>
1688900 1693440 <i>he mistrusted<br />Italian crews and filmmakers.</i>
1693530 1701530 <i>He really did feel<br />they were fairly careless about actors,</i>
1702122 1706616 <i>not necessarily having safety<br />as their first concern.</i>
1706710 1712922 <i>And both he and Eli,<br />in conversing about this film,</i>
1713007 1721006 <i>talk about the fact that Clint was always<br />urging this relatively untutored -</i>
1722641 1727431 <i>untutored in the ways of Italian westerns -</i>
1727521 1730764 <i>New York actor on taking care of himself,</i>
1730858 1738858 <i>on being utterly certain about what<br />safety measures were available to him.</i>
1741034 1749033 <i>This betrayal on the part of Blondie<br />is strangely unmotivated.</i>
1749126 1754292 <i>I have never understood exactly why<br />he needs to break up this partnership,</i>
1754381 1760878 <i>or break it up in so violent a way -<br />in an almost sadistic way.</i>
1762055 1765047 <i>Do we really wanna say "almost"?<br />It is sadistic.</i>
1765142 1772104 <i>And it is kind of a strangeness,<br />which gets buried as the picture develops,</i>
1772190 1780190 <i>but which certainly sets up the tension<br />between Tuco and Blondie.</i>
1781699 1786193 <i>This business of leaving him<br />here in the desert,</i>
1786287 1788995 <i>without water, without food,<br />without protection from the elements,</i>
1791042 1798756 <i>is a very strange activity<br />for this character to indulge in.</i>
1802178 1810051 <i>I guess it introduces<br />an element of the absurd in this film,</i>
1810144 1814513 <i>and I think the element of the absurd<br />was significant for Leone.</i>
1814607 1822606 <i>I mean, he, in the end, is never<br />incredibly careful about motivations.</i>
1829079 1835542 <i>I think his idea was that human nature<br />was untrustworthy, dangerous,</i>
1835627 1837914 <i>difficult to predict,</i>
1838004 1845593 <i>and I think he liked the element<br />of human carelessness in his films.</i>
1845679 1851846 <i>And it sort of fits<br />with his whole interest in the surreal,</i>
1851935 1858056 <i>his interest in expanding the range</i>
1858149 1863644 <i>of what westerns could take up<br />emotionally and so forth.</i>
1866908 1869945 <i>Again, here is the Van Cleef character</i>
1870035 1876532 <i>being typically implacable,<br />typically merciless,</i>
1877710 1882079 <i>and, you know, getting the job done.</i>
1893392 1895383 <i>This was the kind of thing...</i>
1895477 1903477 <i>In the 1960s, where we were unused<br />to this kind of violence -</i>
1904069 1907653 <i>particularly between a man<br />and a woman - in films,</i>
1907740 1913782 <i>and it is the sort of thing that put off</i>
1913871 1919866 <i>in particular the American critics<br />of this film when it was released.</i>
1919959 1926547 <i>Most of the reviews could not say enough<br />about this kind of behavior</i>
1926633 1929250 <i>between characters in the film.</i>
1929344 1932006 <i>I think now, the years having gone on</i>
1932680 1939143 <i>and violence having<br />vastly expanded in the movies,</i>
1939228 1943187 <i>it does not seem<br />particularly shocking to look at now.</i>
1943274 1951274 <i>But at the time it was certainly something<br />that I would say was the major component</i>
1953034 1956618 <i>of most of the serious reviewing<br />of this film,</i>
1956704 1963952 <i>and these films - the three spaghetti<br />westerns that Leone made with Clint.</i>
1981144 1985729 <i>We tend,<br />because these pictures are so vivid</i>
1985816 1991107 <i>and partly because of Clint's presence<br />in them and their intrinsic qualities,</i>
1991196 1996691 <i>we tend to think spaghetti westerns<br />began and ended with Sergio Leone.</i>
1996785 1998526 <i>But that's not true.</i>
2000914 2006626 <i>There were dozens more previous to this.</i>
2006712 2013254 <i>There were hundreds more after<br />the success of these movies of Leone's.</i>
2013343 2018257 <i>Most of them have not<br />survived terribly well.</i>
2018347 2021885 <i>I myself have seen<br />only a handful of others,</i>
2021976 2029976 <i>and they don't seem to me to compare<br />to the Leone films in their quality.</i>
2034363 2042363 <i>This is a scene<br />that is a vastly extended version</i>
2043372 2048742 <i>of a scene that appeared<br />20-odd years earlier</i>
2048836 2052329 <i>in a James Cagney movie<br />called</i> Blonde Crazy.
2052423 2054915 <i>It's the same deal.</i>
2055009 2062052 <i>The criminal guy comes into, in the<br />Cagney film, a pawnshop to buy a gun,</i>
2062141 2070140 <i>and, you know, talks the owner<br />of the shop into letting him heft a gun,</i>
2073777 2078192 <i>feel out the weight<br />and seriousness of the weapon,</i>
2078281 2086029 <i>and then cons him<br />into giving him a few bullets,</i>
2086122 2094122 <i>which he then loads into the gun<br />and holds up the pawnshop owner</i>
2095173 2098291 <i>with the very gun<br />that he's thinking of buying,</i>
2098384 2101502 <i>and walks out with the gun<br />and the bullets in it.</i>
2101596 2105260 <i>Now, that's a very quick scene<br />in</i> Blonde Crazy -
2105350 2110766 <i>probably doesn't take more than a minute<br />or a minute and a half of screen time.</i>
2110855 2117976 <i>Typical of Leone - he takes<br />that little notion and vastly extends it.</i>
2118070 2122985 <i>I mean, this scene<br />goes on a good long time.</i>
2127329 2134827 <i>It's the same joke, and it's one<br />of those jokes that continues to work.</i>
2136004 2141374 <i>Important to say about Leone is that<br />his father had been in the film business,</i>
2141468 2144085 <i>had been a director of Italian films</i>
2144179 2149674 <i>and had fallen foul<br />of the Fascist regime in Italy.</i>
2149768 2152100 <i>But Leone was two things:</i>
2152187 2157933 <i>he was movie-crazy by virtue<br />of his relationship to his father,</i>
2158026 2160814 <i>and he was also kind of America-crazy.</i>
2161738 2169737 <i>He was a guy who, when the war ended,<br />just got drunk on American movies.</i>
2173124 2179712 <i>All throughout Europe they had, of course,<br />not been played throughout World War II -</i>
2179797 2183836 <i>they weren't imported to Europe,<br />American films.</i>
2183926 2187089 <i>And they arrived in<br />a kind of flood after the war,</i>
2187180 2190423 <i>and it was a revelation, not just to Leone.</i>
2190516 2195477 <i>The entire French wave<br />was taken up by seeing these movies</i>
2195563 2198396 <i>and realizing what they'd missed.</i>
2198482 2202441 <i>And this was most advantageous<br />to American movies.</i>
2202528 2210528 <i>The reputation of directors like Hawks<br />and Raoul Walsh and William Wyler</i>
2211704 2218917 <i>was really made by the Europeans<br />having this intense relationship</i>
2219002 2225465 <i>with the movies that they had not seen<br />from, say 1941 through 1945.</i>
2225550 2227917 <i>And Leone was very much a part of that,</i>
2228011 2232130 <i>and he was also very drawn<br />to American popular fiction,</i>
2232224 2239221 <i>which included westerns and<br />crime pictures and novels, film noir.</i>
2240482 2246524 <i>And this was enormously<br />influential on Leone</i>
2246613 2252575 <i>in terms of the stories he liked,<br />the stories he wanted to do.</i>
2252661 2258452 <i>His big thing, though,<br />was to lend an epic quality</i>
2258541 2265163 <i>to these essentially very modest<br />literary endeavors that he read.</i>
2265257 2268920 <i>He always claimed he read<br />a lot of Faulkner and F Scott Fitzgerald</i>
2269009 2273754 <i>and the major American writers.<br />Whether he did or not, I'm not certain.</i>
2273847 2281847 <i>But there's no question that popular<br />literature was a huge influence on Leone,</i>
2282856 2285439 <i>as were the popular movies.</i>
2286277 2290316 <i>Hence this kind of borrowing<br />from</i> Blonde Crazy
2292574 2299446 <i>and the vast extension of the little comic<br />conceit of that early Cagney movie.</i>
2308632 2313752 <i>We're coming<br />to what is the major new scene</i>
2313846 2318339 <i>in the American restoration</i><br />of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
2318433 2323803 <i>This is a scene<br />that was in the Italian release print,</i>
2323896 2331360 <i>but was excised from the American<br />version when it appeared here in 1968.</i>
2331446 2333687 <i>It's called "the grotto scene",</i>
2333781 2341781 <i>and it's the Tuco character<br />getting himself re-associated</i>
2342582 2347042 <i>with what was once his criminal gang.</i>
2347128 2355128 <i>And it essentially is him<br />conning these guys into joining him,</i>
2358931 2364893 <i>and in particular joining him so that<br />he can take his revenge against Blondie.</i>
2368231 2375024 <i>It's a significant scene, I think,<br />only in this respect:</i>
2375113 2383113 <i>which is that when he finally goes to kill<br />Blondie he's got all these guys with him,</i>
2383705 2391294 <i>and in the picture as it previously existed<br />we're not certain where he recruited them.</i>
2391380 2397376 <i>But in this scene<br />we learn where he recruited them.</i>
2397469 2400052 <i>And it's kind of a nice scene,</i>
2400138 2408138 <i>and since we have now all the time in the<br />world to study the work of Sergio Leone,</i>
2416570 2419813 <i>it seems to me a good addition.</i>
2421367 2424576 But who knows where they are now?
2425538 2429327 Ah, it's too bad, friends.<br />Tough luck I haven't found you.
2429417 2431829 I had a good deal for you.
2433963 2437706 There's a big son of a bitch<br />who's got $4,000.
2438843 2443679 $4,000. And I know where to find him.
2443764 2450852 <i>This monologue is kind of<br />an amusing Leone sort of a deal.</i>
2452982 2458523 <i>He knows that his old pals<br />are somewhere in this room,</i>
2459155 2462238 <i>and, of course, when the ropes appear,</i>
2462324 2470162 <i>having heard his reflections on the money<br />he knows where and how to get...</i>
2471708 2476248 <i>I love the way those close-ups<br />drop into the frame there.</i>
2478047 2485169 <i>It's a nice little minor example<br />of Leone's sense of humor.</i>
2503072 2506815 <i>One way of looking at the character<br />that Eli plays in this picture</i>
2506910 2509572 <i>is that he is a kind of life force.</i>
2509662 2515498 <i>However nasty he is,<br />however amoral he is,</i>
2515584 2520420 <i>he's just a guy who's full of life<br />in this picture.</i>
2520547 2526668 <i>And I think the picture,<br />to some degree, runs on his energy.</i>
2526762 2530255 <i>We really like it when he appears.</i>
2530390 2537262 <i>He's not playing in the kind<br />of legato mode of Clint in this picture.</i>
2537356 2544353 <i>He's always busy and bustling<br />and full of cockamamie ideas and all that.</i>
2544446 2547359 <i>This little sequence here<br />is to me interesting</i>
2547449 2552785 <i>because it is where what amounts<br />to the major theme of this movie</i>
2552913 2555200 <i>begins slowly to be introduced.</i>
2555290 2563289 <i>We are in this town,<br />and it's a town that is being, you know...</i>
2564423 2570214 <i>Typical of the way the bourgeoisie<br />appears in all Leone movies -</i>
2570304 2576801 <i>they're all hypocrites, they all go with<br />whatever the current flow is in their lives.</i>
2576894 2579386 <i>If the Confederates are in town,<br />they're Confederates,</i>
2579480 2581892 <i>if the Yankees are in town,<br />they're Yankees.</i>
2581983 2584975 <i>If Tuco's in town,<br />they will cooperate with Tuco,</i>
2585111 2589321 <i>however difficult that may be for them.</i>
2589407 2595403 <i>That's Leone's basic idea,<br />I think, of human nature.</i>
2595496 2601492 <i>But the business here<br />is only to slightly prefigure</i>
2601627 2605996 <i>where Tuco and Blondie<br />will be going in the future.</i>
2608092 2611960 <i>He is going to attempt<br />to kill Blondie here.</i>
2614848 2620514 <i>One of the things that's, of course,<br />required of a western hero</i>
2620645 2624354 <i>is that he is preternaturally alert.</i>
2624482 2631696 <i>So, even though he is preoccupied<br />with cleaning and reassembling his gun,</i>
2631823 2637694 <i>he will hear people who are,<br />as we see here,</i>
2637829 2643950 <i>beginning to stalk him and surround him<br />and attempt to kill him.</i>
2655472 2660967 <i>When Clint Eastwood is around<br />you cannot walk too quietly,</i>
2661061 2668649 <i>because, you know,<br />like all western heroes</i>
2668734 2676734 <i>he is peculiarly in touch<br />with odd sounds, odd menaces</i>
2679745 2684160 <i>that the rest of us would not be alert to.</i>
2684249 2688834 <i>That's part of the spirit<br />of the western hero,</i>
2688921 2694542 <i>that he's better, almost magically so.</i>
2696178 2703175 <i>He's better at staying alert,<br />staying ahead of the game,</i>
2703268 2709514 <i>being ready for assaults<br />that we would not be ready for.</i>
2709608 2714568 <i>And that's particularly true<br />in this little sequence.</i>
2727875 2732790 <i>Particularly true in that outside<br />an army is moving through the streets,</i>
2732922 2738383 <i>with all the attendant noise<br />and confusion and kerfuffle</i>
2738469 2743464 <i>that goes with mass movement<br />of men and arms.</i>
2743599 2748309 <i>But Clint can kind of cut through all that</i>
2748396 2753641 <i>and hear the particular menace<br />that's stalking him.</i>
2766830 2769663 <i>They're hoping the movement<br />will cover their movements.</i>
2782512 2790512 <i>That business, incidentally, of tying<br />the gun firing to the victims of its firing</i>
2791188 2795773 <i>is something that was forbidden<br />in American movies.</i>
2795859 2803607 <i>In other words, you couldn't show the gun<br />firing and then its victim falling dead.</i>
2806369 2810283 <i>That was a genteel-ism<br />that had established itself</i>
2810373 2814366 <i>in the course of American<br />motion-picture censorship.</i>
2814460 2817043 <i>Leone either didn't know<br />or didn't care about it,</i>
2817171 2821381 <i>and Clint said "I didn't think I'd tell him<br />because it was a great idea."</i>
2821467 2829306 <i>So you do get the shot of the gun firing<br />and its victim falling</i>
2829391 2833555 <i>all in the same shot,<br />not done with cuts.</i>
2834355 2836642 <i>Here what is going to happen, of course,</i>
2836732 2844732 <i>is that Tuco is going to reconstruct,<br />in effect, all his false deaths</i>
2847701 2853993 <i>that Blondie had rescued him from<br />in their previous partnership.</i>
2854083 2862083 <i>In other words, Clint is going<br />to have to put a noose around his neck</i>
2862716 2867755 <i>and stand on a table or stool.</i>
2870515 2875260 <i>The difference here being<br />that Tuco is not going to fire the gun</i>
2875395 2880606 <i>that will separate the rope,<br />or break the rope.</i>
2880733 2882815 <i>He's gonna leave him hanging there.</i>
2957851 2963596 <i>That is one of the most odd and violent<br />rescues from almost certain death</i>
2963689 2966602 <i>that probably the movies ever contained.</i>
2966692 2974110 <i>The notion that the big gun<br />would intrude upon the small gunplay</i>
2974200 2977613 <i>going on between Eli and Clint here</i>
2977703 2984450 <i>is important for Leone to establish<br />because he's going to establish the fact</i>
2986462 2994462 <i>that a much more violent life is<br />proceeding around these characters.</i>
2997473 3001717 <i>This is another restored scene -<br />it's about four minutes long -</i>
3001852 3008394 <i>that was eliminated from<br />the first American release of the picture.</i>
3008526 3015238 <i>It is the introduction of this character</i>
3015323 3023323 <i>to the fact that<br />his narrow interests are being pursued</i>
3026251 3034251 <i>against a background<br />of much larger and more tragic violence.</i>
3040598 3048598 <i>What he is encountering here, which<br />is the remnants of a Confederate unit</i>
3049566 3056563 <i>that's been obviously defeated<br />and decimated in this war</i>
3059409 3066701 <i>even, to a degree,<br />moves this thoroughly evil guy</i>
3066790 3071956 <i>to at least an element<br />of ironic compassion,</i>
3072087 3076456 <i>as he looks around<br />at the devastation that's occurred</i>
3076592 3084592 <i>and begins to take in<br />the notion of the vastness of killing.</i>
3084975 3091142 <i>Incidentally, stray dogs<br />constantly appear in Leone's films.</i>
3093067 3098653 <i>You know, minor victims<br />of major catastrophes.</i>
3098739 3102323 <i>I think it's something<br />he took from Kurosawa,</i>
3102409 3107154 <i>who also had a famous stray dog<br />in</i> Yojimbo.
3107289 3115288 <i>But this encounter, again,<br />is an interesting pre-figuration</i>
3115588 3119081 <i>of where this movie is going to go.</i>
3119175 3122509 <i>And the little head-shake by him</i>
3122637 3129179 <i>indicates a miniscule amount of humanity<br />operating in this character.</i>
3129852 3131934 <i>But...</i>
3134816 3139936 <i>This movie is, at this level,<br />rather nicely constructed.</i>
3140029 3148029 <i>That is to say, the introduction of the<br />fact that there are vast armies in the field</i>
3149705 3156953 <i>and near to these guys<br />who are pursuing their little chest of gold</i>
3157046 3159538 <i>just keeps kind of being hinted at.</i>
3159674 3165043 <i>You know, the explosion of the big gun in<br />the previous sequence with Clint and Eli,</i>
3165137 3173137 <i>and now this comparatively speaking -<br />to what we're about to see in the film -</i>
3175564 3183564 <i>introduction of this kind of<br />decimation of ordinary humanity</i>
3186575 3188816 <i>is actually rather nicely done.</i>
3188910 3192995 <i>I mean, this film is building<br />towards a couple of climaxes</i>
3193081 3197075 <i>that will establish, if nothing else,</i>
3197169 3202255 <i>Sergio Leone's - how to put it?<br />-pacifist credentials.</i>
3207345 3213010 <i>This is, in a way,<br />quite a consciously antiwar movie.</i>
3214727 3218186 <i>I mean, probably in a way<br />all great war movies -</i>
3218272 3222687 <i>which this is only half of,<br />it's not entirely a war movie -</i>
3222776 3227942 <i>but all the great war movies<br />are essentially antiwar movies.</i>
3228073 3231611 <i>That's the point of view<br />that the filmmaker takes</i>
3231702 3239702 <i>in most serious examinations<br />of wartime activities.</i>
3250804 3255890 <i>We haven't said much<br />about Ennio Morricone's score.</i>
3255976 3262221 <i>That's a very familiar little theme that<br />he's used in previous spaghetti westerns.</i>
3262315 3268903 <i>Morricone is a great genius<br />of film scoring.</i>
3268988 3276988 <i>There is just, you know, a remarkable<br />uniqueness in what he's doing.</i>
3278498 3285996 <i>In other words, he's expanded<br />the forces of available sounds,</i>
3286089 3292836 <i>using chorals, using instruments like<br />penny whistles, Jew's-harps and so forth.</i>
3294681 3300017 <i>At first, I think, because<br />there wasn't much money for scoring,</i>
3300144 3308144 <i>but it became such a unique Morricone<br />signature, that kind of scoring, that...</i>
3309445 3315315 <i>And they set, in a way<br />that very few film scores do.</i>
3317369 3322114 <i>They are part of the uniqueness<br />of Leone's vision.</i>
3322207 3328044 <i>Certainly it's true of Clint,<br />who had not heard any score for this film,</i>
3328171 3336171 <i>and after he had made</i> Fistful of Dollars,<br /><i>the first evidence he had of a finished film</i>
3337389 3344728 <i>was actually an LP, or perhaps<br />it was a tape, of Morricone's score</i>
3344813 3347555 <i>which got sent to him<br />when he was back in the US.</i>
3347691 3351559 <i>He heard this thing and said<br />"Wow, this is really interesting."</i>
3351695 3353982 <i>"I've never heard a score like this."</i>
3354072 3358316 <i>And then when he saw the film<br />with the score integrated into it,</i>
3358410 3364655 <i>he recognized - since Clint is himself<br />quite an expert musician - that this was...</i>
3366250 3368833 <i>It wasn't the first score<br />Morricone had done,</i>
3368919 3371331 <i>but this was the score<br />that announced him</i>
3371422 3374790 <i>as a major figure in film scoring.</i>
3374884 3382884 <i>And the extension of Morricone's<br />rather unique vision into this film,</i>
3385436 3389020 <i>and the subsequent films,<br />I think established him</i>
3389106 3396604 <i>as one of the most important innovators<br />in musical film history.</i>
3401952 3405695 <i>He has been tracked, he has been found.</i>
3428812 3431224 <i>Nice little moment here.</i>
3431314 3433225 <i>"Too bad, Shorty."</i>
3434275 3436482 Sorry, Shorty.
3446538 3450702 <i>Now this is the beginning of<br />what will be an inordinately long sequence,</i>
3450792 3458792 <i>in which the Clint character<br />is tormented by this walk in the desert</i>
3462511 3464969 <i>by Eli's character.</i>
3470477 3473595 <i>In Christopher Frayling's<br />really quite remarkable</i>
3473689 3478684 <i>and complete biography of Sergio Leone,</i>
3478819 3482437 <i>which is an extremely valuable book,</i>
3482531 3486195 <i>he makes mention in this sequence</i>
3486285 3494285 <i>of Leone's being influenced<br />by the surrealist painters.</i>
3499548 3503041 <i>In particular, these desert sequences</i>
3503135 3510552 <i>Frayling traces<br />to the surrealist Giorgio de Chirico.</i>
3514562 3521810 <i>And I think it's true. This was a painter<br />who used bleak landscapes,</i>
3521903 3526488 <i>and we do know<br />that Leone knew that work.</i>
3527992 3531155 <i>There are other elements.</i>
3531245 3535580 <i>Leone was quite mad<br />for the French painter Magritte -</i>
3535708 3537995 <i>he even owned a small Magritte.</i>
3538085 3546004 <i>And you'll see touches of that kind<br />of landscaping in this sequence.</i>
3554101 3560437 <i>The cameraman on this picture was<br />Tonto Delli Colli, who was new to Leone.</i>
3562108 3566397 <i>And I spoke to Frayling about</i>
3571243 3577455 <i>Leone referring to these pictures,<br />asking him to take a look at the pictures,</i>
3577582 3580950 <i>asking him to find<br />photographically the equivalent</i>
3581044 3583877 <i>of what some of these painters had done.</i>
3583964 3586956 <i>I've always particularly loved...</i>
3587092 3594306 <i>There is a classic example<br />of surrealism, I think -</i>
3594391 3597634 <i>the vast landscape,<br />two tiny little figures.</i>
3597769 3601558 <i>Again, that's something<br />that Leone liked to do a lot.</i>
3601648 3607314 <i>But the parasol<br />is a wonderful touch in this sequence.</i>
3607445 3613736 <i>It is just so absurd.<br />It is so Magritte-like -</i>
3613826 3619412 <i>you know, who always put bowler hats<br />on figures standing in strange landscapes.</i>
3619498 3625244 <i>And this is a particularly<br />good example, I think,</i>
3625337 3629672 <i>of the rough-and-ready<br />surrealism of Sergio.</i>
3635514 3638006 <i>This is that kind of European notion</i>
3638100 3644437 <i>that in torment there can be<br />a considerable amount of beauty.</i>
3644523 3651645 <i>I think it's probably appropriate to say<br />that by this time, by this third film,</i>
3653490 3657028 <i>Clint had become somewhat disaffected -</i>
3657161 3661529 <i>not especially with Leone, but with<br />the whole spaghetti-western thing.</i>
3661623 3663955 <i>He really had begun to understand,</i>
3664042 3668036 <i>that even though these films had not yet<br />been released in the United States,</i>
3668129 3673374 <i>even though his long stint on</i> Rawhide<br /><i>was clearly coming to an end,</i>
3673509 3677468 <i>that he was gonna have<br />to make his career elsewhere.</i>
3677555 3680638 <i>And I think he felt that in this film,</i>
3680725 3686220 <i>although he had negotiated a much better<br />salary than in the previous Leone pictures</i>
3686314 3688897 <i>and had a percentage<br />of this picture, actually,</i>
3688983 3693318 <i>which was unprecedented<br />among Italian filmmakers at the time -</i>
3693404 3701404 <i>the truth was that I think he saw that<br />his part in these pictures was diminishing.</i>
3705333 3708416 <i>Not in terms of total screen time<br />or anything like that,</i>
3708544 3713162 <i>but rather his importance in the film<br />was being diminished</i>
3713256 3720754 <i>as Sergio went<br />for a much more epic-scale film.</i>
3722933 3730772 <i>Eli remembered Clint constantly saying to<br />him that this was his last one with Leone,</i>
3730899 3733766 <i>that he was going to have<br />to go back to the US,</i>
3733860 3739606 <i>was going to have to establish himself<br />as an American movie star.</i>
3739700 3747039 <i>And though I think he had maybe<br />a little bit more contention with Sergio</i>
3747124 3751288 <i>on this and that aspect<br />of his performance in the picture,</i>
3751420 3754128 <i>he was still doing it in good heart.</i>
3754256 3757965 <i>He just knew that he was going<br />to move on from this.</i>
3758093 3764304 <i>And Eli perfectly understood that,<br />and perfectly understood that -</i>
3764390 3770477 <i>and in fact Eli went on<br />and made other pictures in Italy -</i>
3770604 3775064 <i>that Clint was done<br />with this aspect of his career.</i>
3775151 3782490 <i>I don't think it was anything to do<br />with egocentricity on the part of the star.</i>
3782575 3787820 <i>It was really that, as he once said to me,</i>
3787913 3791577 <i>"I could go on doing this<br />for another decade, but it wouldn't be..."</i>
3791667 3798755 <i>That's a great little moment,<br />as he pulls the empty boot toward him.</i>
3798841 3804177 <i>This little sequence here is,<br />again, part of the restoration.</i>
3804305 3812018 <i>It was not included in the American<br />version of this film when it came out.</i>
3812103 3816347 <i>It's new and it's good.</i>
3819527 3827527 <i>Again, I don't know how much<br />establishment we need at this juncture</i>
3827702 3832697 <i>of Eli's sadistic behavior to Blondie,</i>
3832791 3835954 <i>but on the other hand it's fun,</i>
3836044 3841289 <i>especially here, where he washes his feet<br />in the precious water.</i>
3845804 3853052 <i>It's worth saying that of course Clint<br />and Eli had a good time on this picture.</i>
3853144 3857229 <i>Eli in particular, perhaps more than Clint,</i>
3859483 3862566 <i>became more intimately<br />associated with Sergio.</i>
3862653 3865065 <i>They took to having dinners together</i>
3865197 3871318 <i>and took to having - to the best of their<br />ability, given their language difficulties -</i>
3871411 3877248 <i>a lot of conversations about movies<br />and life and all that in general.</i>
3879837 3886504 <i>Eli had a great time with this movie, and<br />I think you can see it his performance.</i>
3886593 3888504 <i>He was really having fun.</i>
3888595 3895467 <i>And given that as a movie actor<br />he had really never had</i>
3895561 3902354 <i>this kind of a leading role where<br />he's absolutely central to the movie...</i>
3902860 3910859 <i>He was much more of a character guy<br />in films like</i> The Misfits <i>or</i> Lord Jim.
3911367 3918364 <i>He did tend to play kind of ethnic weirdos,<br />if not outright ethnic villains,</i>
3918457 3926457 <i>and this picture gives him a lot of good<br />screen time and a lot of character to play.</i>
3927466 3931050 <i>And he really did make the most of it.</i>
3933598 3941437 <i>At this point in this lengthy sequence of-how to put it?<br />-heated torment,</i>
3943608 3951231 <i>again, I think we're dealing with<br />a Leone who is setting his own pace.</i>
3951324 3958741 <i>It's obvious that you could make<br />this sequence in a lot less screen time,</i>
3958830 3965452 <i>but, again, I like this leisureliness<br />of the development of the movie.</i>
3969257 3977096 <i>It seems to me to give the film<br />a kind of scope and grandeur</i>
3977182 3983349 <i>that is really unexpected in a movie</i>
3983438 3988774 <i>with the kind of dubious antecedents<br />that this film has.</i>
3988860 3996324 <i>It's almost as if Leone is transcending the<br />genre that he has invented, or reinvented.</i>
3997702 4005166 <i>Now, the arrival of this...<br />Well, it's really a hospital wagon.</i>
4006461 4013253 <i>This, of course, is what saves Clint's life<br />in the development of the film.</i>
4034822 4042822 <i>This is, again, one of Sergio's<br />really leisurely revelations of the action</i>
4047960 4055960 <i>and the significance of what these guys<br />find in this runaway ambulance.</i>
4064475 4072475 <i>What will happen here is that the two<br />of them will get the most significant clue</i>
4074068 4076526 <i>anyone in the movie has thus far had</i>
4076612 4082483 <i>as to the location of this<br />famously missing chest of gold.</i>
4085413 4087996 <i>It's kind of cleverly set up</i>
4088082 4096082 <i>in the sense that each of them<br />gets one piece of information,</i>
4096716 4101927 <i>and each piece of information<br />will be in and of itself useless.</i>
4102013 4110012 <i>It requires both pieces of information in<br />order to find out where the gold is buried.</i>
4110937 4115898 <i>So now these people<br />who have been in deadly contention</i>
4115984 4122230 <i>are - or will be - brought together<br />out of mutual need.</i>
4123200 4127615 <i>Each needs the other to survive<br />with his piece of information.</i>
4127704 4134076 <i>So it becomes a significant<br />turning point in the movie.</i>
4154523 4161235 <i>When I was writing about this movie in<br />the biography I wrote of Clint Eastwood,</i>
4161320 4166315 <i>I characterized Tuco<br />as kind of like Till Eulenspiegel -</i>
4166408 4174372 <i>you know, the merry prankster, outside<br />the law, outside of conventional morality,</i>
4174458 4177667 <i>but someone we can't help but like.</i>
4179463 4183878 <i>And I think I'll stand by<br />that characterization.</i>
4183968 4189213 <i>He's maybe<br />not the merriest of pranksters,</i>
4189306 4192549 <i>but there is something prankish<br />in his character,</i>
4192643 4197888 <i>and therefore something<br />kind of very human,</i>
4197982 4204820 <i>no matter how antisocial<br />much of his behavior is.</i>
4204905 4210650 <i>Now he's getting the information,<br />or the partial information,</i>
4210743 4217911 <i>that will lead on to their adventures<br />in the second half of the movie.</i>
4218001 4220413 What was that you said about the dollars?
4220503 4222961 $200,000, all mine.
4223882 4226089 Was the Third Cavalry's.
4226885 4228967 Baker has nothing.
4229637 4233426 The gold... I hid the gold.<br />The gold is safe.
4234559 4236516 Where? Where, here?
4236603 4244603 <i>Again, this is a kind of conventional piece<br />of plotting in terms of popular fiction,</i>
4245862 4250572 <i>whether it's a detective story<br />or a western or what-have-you -</i>
4250658 4258657 <i>the dying man's confession<br />that motivates the rest of the movie.</i>
4267424 4273420 <i>That's a significant aspect<br />of Leone's film-making -</i>
4275599 4277681 <i>there are always references</i>
4277768 4285768 <i>to the bluntest, crudest conventions<br />of popular fictioneering in the movies.</i>
4286235 4291947 <i>But in the end these films<br />are exercises in style,</i>
4292032 4300032 <i>of style transcending the banalities of plot<br />and of characterization, for that matter.</i>
4304628 4312627 <i>If you give the film<br />a rich visual dimension -</i>
4313094 4320387 <i>which Leone does in just shot after shot,<br />just in this little, simple sequence -</i>
4320476 4328476 <i>it finally gives the<br />film a kind of grandeur</i>
4329318 4335564 <i>that other films, in particular<br />other spaghetti westerns, didn't have.</i>
4337201 4345201 <i>In my critical practice, I've always loved<br />the guys who take popular conventions</i>
4349463 4356801 <i>and in some way - with filmmakers,<br />usually through visual means -</i>
4356886 4359628 <i>transcend those things.</i>
4359723 4366390 <i>You know, give you<br />a new and different kind of reality</i>
4366479 4370097 <i>that transcends<br />the conventions of the genre.</i>
4371568 4373980 <i>This is the moment...</i>
4374070 4378439 <i>He now,<br />having wanted to slowly kill Clint,</i>
4379826 4383114 <i>he now must rescue him.</i>
4389461 4396879 <i>The sadist of ten minutes ago has now<br />become the bosom buddy of this moment.</i>
4396968 4399801 <i>And that's funny.</i>
4399888 4407887 <i>And I think it's terrifically well played<br />by the now desperate Tuco.</i>
4429041 4432830 <i>Tuco has, of course,<br />commandeered the ambulance</i>
4432920 4439292 <i>and is now entering on a scene<br />that, again, was missing</i>
4439385 4445597 <i>from the original<br />American release print of the film.</i>
4445682 4449141 <i>This is really a very<br />simple little sequence</i>
4449228 4456270 <i>where, in effect, he's asking these<br />Confederate soldiers for directions</i>
4456359 4460944 <i>and trying to pass through their lines<br />and pretend to be something he isn't,</i>
4461030 4464193 <i>which is a Confederate soldier.</i>
4467036 4469528 <i>Again, it's a nice little scene.</i>
4469622 4475117 <i>You can understand why,<br />in the desire of the American distributors</i>
4475211 4479751 <i>to make a film<br />of more or less conventional length,</i>
4479841 4482629 <i>you could get by without this sequence.</i>
4482718 4486461 <i>But it's a nice little<br />sequence nonetheless.</i>
4488808 4495145 <i>Again, it's worth sitting around<br />watching this movie on home video,</i>
4495231 4499225 <i>and we do have the time<br />for this sort of thing.</i>
4501904 4504737 <i>This little soldier<br />is a character who appeared</i>
4504824 4510819 <i>in at least one other Sergio picture.</i>
4510912 4516203 <i>I think he was the ticket seller<br />in</i> Once Upon a Time in the West
4516293 4518204 <i>at the railway station.</i>
4518295 4526295 <i>But anyway, where Tuco<br />is bringing Blondie is to a mission</i>
4527512 4535476 <i>of the kind that dotted the Catholic<br />American Southwest of the time.</i>
4538773 4545645 <i>There is, in all of Leone's work<br />a kind of wistfulness</i>
4545739 4553032 <i>about the Catholicism of his youth,<br />that he was obviously brought up in.</i>
4556373 4564373 <i>He is a specialist in kind of<br />bare, ruined choirs and graveyards.</i>
4565299 4573299 <i>In all of the panoply<br />of conventional Catholicism,</i>
4574225 4580847 <i>which I think he had pretty much<br />put behind him, as many Italians do,</i>
4584360 4589480 <i>there is - and I'll remark on it<br />later on in the film -</i>
4589573 4593692 <i>he does often stage sequences,</i>
4593786 4601786 <i>usually sequences<br />that have some pitiable quality to them,</i>
4603546 4610759 <i>in disused churches<br />or places like this mission,</i>
4610843 4618843 <i>which are doing their best<br />to succor the wounded of the war.</i>
4623940 4630733 <i>And I think that does represent for Leone<br />some kind of wistfulness</i>
4630822 4638822 <i>for a better world<br />or a world that had been lost -</i>
4639497 4647166 <i>and lost, I think, in Leone's view<br />in the cataclysm of World War II.</i>
4647255 4655253 <i>I think this movie<br />constantly refers to the way</i>
4655345 4663139 <i>the vastness and horror of that war<br />destabilized people's expectations,</i>
4663228 4665640 <i>destabilized their morality.</i>
4665731 4671522 <i>And I think the notion<br />he's exploring in this movie</i>
4671612 4679612 <i>of war as the ultimate cataclysm<br />that destroys conventional morality</i>
4683457 4690250 <i>is something that is very much<br />on Leone's mind in this film,</i>
4690339 4697257 <i>and something that I think he explored<br />in other aspects of his work,</i>
4697346 4699678 <i>but most directly in this film.</i>
4699765 4706261 <i>This is a film that is implicitly about</i>
4706354 4712896 <i>the lingering effects<br />of vast combat on ordinary people,</i>
4712985 4716603 <i>and how it afflicts their morality.</i>
4716697 4722693 <i>I'm not saying that Tuco would've been<br />a saintly man without these interventions,</i>
4722787 4729033 <i>but he might've been<br />a slightly different man</i>
4729126 4737126 <i>were he not so profoundly involved<br />in this massive dislocation,</i>
4739053 4745015 <i>which wartime has imposed upon him.</i>
4745101 4751973 <i>I mean, all bets are off,<br />morally speaking, in this context.</i>
4778591 4784963 <i>I don't really think that when Leone<br />was pitching this movie to Clint</i>
4785056 4787718 <i>that he was particularly suggesting</i>
4787809 4793430 <i>that Eli would become a dominant figure<br />as the film worked out.</i>
4793523 4801523 <i>I have a feeling that part of the dominance<br />simply arises out of Eli's performance.</i>
4801656 4806274 <i>It's just so compelling and so amusing</i>
4808412 4816412 <i>that in a way it backs off Clint<br />and, in a way, Lee Van Cleef.</i>
4819715 4825176 <i>When you've got an actor rippin'<br />and tearing the way Eli is in this movie,</i>
4825262 4833262 <i>about the only thing his fellow actors can<br />do is back off and gracefully partner him.</i>
4834021 4837309 <i>Now, as this movie will develop,</i>
4837399 4845399 <i>Clint will manifest<br />conventionally heroic behavior,</i>
4848285 4852074 <i>and even conventionally heroic ideals,</i>
4852164 4860163 <i>but the competition for amusing screen time<br />is bound to go to a character like Eli.</i>
4864842 4871339 <i>I'm not sure Clint would have recognized<br />that to begin with when he read the script.</i>
4871432 4875221 <i>I think what he did recognize<br />is that this is a movie</i>
4875311 4882183 <i>in which Sergio is moving toward<br />what we might call his mature style,</i>
4882276 4885689 <i>which was for a much more epic cinema</i>
4885780 4889865 <i>than the kind of films that Clint<br />had appeared with him in previously,</i>
4889951 4892864 Fistful of Dollars <i>and</i> A Few Dollars More.
4892954 4900293 <i>These are movies with much higher<br />aspirations, much broader themes,</i>
4902547 4905629 <i>a much bigger scope for Leone's talents.</i>
4905715 4909333 <i>And I think that if Clint<br />had a problem with that,</i>
4909427 4914593 <i>it was simply that Leone<br />was going in his direction</i>
4914683 4920929 <i>and Clint was going in his direction,<br />and the two directions</i>
4921022 4926233 <i>were, if not diametrically opposed,<br />somewhat opposed.</i>
4927279 4933696 <i>I think Clint, maybe more than Sergio,<br />was cool with that.</i>
4933785 4936868 <i>I think Sergio would've liked<br />to have clung to Clint.</i>
4936955 4939287 <i>He came to him<br />and wanted him to go on</i>
4939374 4942867 <i>and do</i> Once Upon a Time in the West<br /><i>a few years later.</i>
4942961 4945794 <i>They had meetings about it<br />and talked about it,</i>
4945881 4953299 <i>and Clint really just felt<br />he was going in some other direction</i>
4953388 4957130 <i>and that Leone had to go in his own.</i>
4965316 4966477 <i>[LAUGHS]</i>
4968485 4971819 <i>Muttering for his reward here.</i>
4993636 4997721 <i>This is an interesting moment<br />that's going to come up here,</i>
4997848 5004310 <i>because the Father, Father Ramirez,<br />is in fact Tuco's brother.</i>
5007315 5010148 <i>This is the uniqueness of this moment,</i>
5010234 5018234 <i>in that Tuco is the only character<br />in the film who has a back story,</i>
5018743 5024455 <i>and the back story is somewhat<br />motivating of his character.</i>
5024540 5028454 <i>These are the two brothers<br />who went their different paths,</i>
5028544 5033163 <i>one becoming a priest -<br />a disapproving priest, obviously -</i>
5033257 5038502 <i>and the other becoming<br />the outlaw figure that Tuco is.</i>
5048940 5053900 <i>I think one of the things going on here -</i>
5054027 5059147 <i>and it will come directly<br />to the surface in a moment or two -</i>
5059241 5065078 <i>is that poor people<br />of their ethnic background</i>
5065205 5067412 <i>really did only have two choices.</i>
5067541 5071034 <i>This is a thing that comes up<br />in many crime pictures -</i>
5071128 5075497 <i>you know, you either become<br />a cop or a priest,</i>
5075590 5080710 <i>or you become an outlaw<br />if you are from dirt-poor circumstances.</i>
5080804 5088804 <i>That American life does not offer<br />to immigrant people, like these two guys,</i>
5089062 5091019 <i>a lot of choices.</i>
5091106 5096192 <i>You're not gonna become the CEO of<br />a great corporation or something like that</i>
5096278 5100397 <i>if you come from these kind<br />of downtrodden backgrounds.</i>
5100490 5108489 <i>So Tuco acknowledges this in a way<br />that his brother can't quite acknowledge.</i>
5111625 5116620 <i>This is something that, of course, comes<br />up time and again in gangster pictures -</i>
5116756 5123503 <i>a gangster picture would be something<br />in Sergio Leone's future, of course.</i>
5123637 5126925 <i>Again, it's very simple stuff,</i>
5127016 5132637 <i>but it is significant that Sergio<br />thought to give this character -</i>
5132772 5137983 <i>obviously betokening<br />his sympathy with this character -</i>
5138110 5145278 <i>some kind of a back story, some kind<br />of a motivation for his present character.</i>
5147995 5150953 Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
5152500 5157619 What good would that be?<br />Just keep on the way you're going.
5158546 5162540 Go away. And the Lord<br />have mercy on your soul.
5162675 5166418 Sure, I'll go - while I'm waiting<br />for the Lord to remember me.
5166513 5172054 I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother<br />Ramirez, will tell you something.
5172185 5174222 You think you're better than I am.
5174354 5177062 Where we came from,<br />if one did not want to die of poverty,
5177190 5179522 one became a priest or a bandit.
5179651 5183861 You chose your way, I chose mine.<br />Mine was harder.
5183988 5185774 You talk of our mother and father.
5185865 5189028 When you left to become a priest,<br />I stayed behind.
5189160 5193324 I must've been ten, twelve,<br />I don't remember which. But I stayed.
5193414 5195872 I tried, but it was no good.
5196000 5197911 Now I'm gonna tell you something.
5198044 5203163 You became a priest because you were<br />too much of a coward to do what I do.
5211682 5213844 <i>I do think there is some bitter truth</i>
5213934 5217302 <i>in that exchange<br />between those two brothers.</i>
5217396 5223563 <i>And I do like the thought that Clint,<br />as I mentioned earlier,</i>
5223694 5226686 <i>is very often the observer,</i>
5226780 5234780 <i>the ironist who is taking in these<br />occasional moments of high emotion.</i>
5235414 5238577 <i>Not commenting on them,<br />not doing anything,</i>
5238709 5242452 <i>but absorbing them<br />into his understanding</i>
5242588 5249255 <i>of what's going on in the film,<br />in the narrative.</i>
5254056 5258141 <i>I like the silence<br />that Clint maintains in this sequence.</i>
5258269 5266269 <i>And something in his eyes that indicates<br />a slight growth in sympathy for Tuco.</i>
5267820 5270482 <i>Nothing he's going<br />to own up to particularly,</i>
5270615 5278615 <i>but some kind of, again,<br />ironic understanding of this guy.</i>
5280333 5285828 <i>And, of course,<br />his hypocritic rationalizations</i>
5285963 5292426 <i>of his relationship with his brother<br />"He's a nice guy" and all that</i>
5295097 5297805 <i>I think are very nice.</i>
5297934 5300016 <i>Look at the little look on Clint's face</i>
5300144 5305229 <i>as he, who knows much better what's<br />gone down between the two brothers,</i>
5305315 5307977 <i>just sort of absorbs that.</i>
5313657 5318117 Well, after a meal<br />there's nothing like a good cigar.
5319120 5327120 <i>It's the first thing that<br />Blondie has volunteered to Tuco</i>
5327504 5329620 <i>in the course of this relationship.</i>
5329714 5337714 <i>In other words, there is some kind<br />of forging of a bond in this sequence.</i>
5339224 5342182 <i>Even though it's a very quiet sequence</i>
5342310 5346474 <i>and not a huge element<br />in the development of the film,</i>
5346564 5353185 <i>it is very nice, and I think it will<br />pay off in the future action of the film.</i>
5355698 5360784 <i>Each has now done all the dirt<br />he needs to do to the other guy,</i>
5360869 5367787 <i>so they are now free to develop some kind<br />of a wary but authentic relationship.</i>
5372548 5380548 <i>Now this is again a short sequence<br />added back in to the film</i>
5380764 5384553 <i>that was cut in the original<br />American release print.</i>
5384685 5392058 <i>It's simply a business of trying<br />to establish where they're going.</i>
5392192 5396857 <i>And they do know now<br />roughly where they should be going.</i>
5396947 5401692 <i>But this whole business of driving through</i>
5401785 5407871 <i>a place where an obviously<br />terrible battle has taken place</i>
5407957 5411200 <i>is new to the American print.</i>
5429604 5434189 <i>Now, this is one<br />of the famous sequences of the film,</i>
5434275 5437893 <i>that these two Confederate soldiers,</i>
5437987 5442106 <i>who are not Confederate soldiers<br />but have their uniforms,</i>
5442241 5445199 <i>see a troop of cavalry<br />coming toward them</i>
5445286 5453285 <i>and assume that they are, from the color<br />of their uniforms, also Confederates.</i>
5455462 5458079 Hurrah for General... What's the name?
5458173 5460790 -Lee.<br />-. .Lee!
5461510 5466505 God is with us because<br />he hates the Yanks too. Hurrah!
5466640 5469849 God's not on our side,<br />cos he hates idiots also.
5469935 5471425 <i>[RICHARD LAUGHS]</i>
5474106 5477019 <i>What's amusing<br />about this sequence is, of course,</i>
5477150 5481690 <i>that dust-covered<br />they look like Confederates,</i>
5482030 5485568 <i>but if you brush the dust off<br />they are Union soldiers.</i>
5485659 5488026 <i>That, incidentally, according to Frayling</i>
5488161 5493531 <i>is a little conceit that is taken<br />from an Ambrose Bierce story</i>
5493667 5496580 <i>in which the same thing happens -</i>
5496670 5501210 <i>a man in a blue uniform, dust-covered,<br />looks like a Confederate.</i>
5501341 5505174 <i>Which I suppose<br />says something about this war,</i>
5505302 5509045 <i>in which brother was set against brother.</i>
5510516 5512473 <i>But this sequence here,</i>
5512560 5520524 <i>which again is an extraordinarily<br />long and fairly complicated one,</i>
5520651 5528445 <i>takes place in a Union prison camp<br />which is called Betterville -</i>
5528534 5534906 <i>a kind of deeply ironic comment<br />on prison camps and so forth.</i>
5536876 5540119 <i>It's an extremely brutal sequence,</i>
5540212 5546504 <i>and intentionally so by Leone.</i>
5547386 5552050 <i>Leone was terribly aware<br />of Andersonville,</i>
5552182 5556096 <i>the notorious Confederate prison camp</i>
5556227 5561722 <i>in which thousands upon thousands<br />of Yankee soldiers died</i>
5561858 5565772 <i>in the most grim<br />and sadistic circumstances.</i>
5565904 5573904 <i>He was also volubly aware of - and<br />made us aware of in various interviews -</i>
5576706 5584500 <i>he was also extremely conscious<br />of the concentration camps</i>
5584589 5588708 <i>of the fairly recent European war,</i>
5588801 5596801 <i>and wanted to make a comment<br />on the death camps.</i>
5597435 5605434 <i>And this film is about - at this point -<br />concentration camps, death camps,</i>
5611657 5616117 <i>and he is definitely making his statement</i>
5616245 5624245 <i>about this truly unprecedented<br />lack of humanity in wartime.</i>
5648026 5653270 <i>Now here, after a long absence<br />from the film, is Angel Eyes -</i>
5654532 5659402 <i>which is a name, I think, Eli gave him.</i>
5659495 5662658 <i>He didn't have that name in the script,</i>
5662790 5669332 <i>but he became Angel Eyes on the set<br />and then Angel Eyes in the film.</i>
5670840 5678840 <i>It's a little bit enigmatic how Angel Eyes<br />has acquired a Yankee uniform,</i>
5680141 5685682 <i>a Yankee rank, actually de facto<br />command of this prison camp.</i>
5686689 5689772 <i>He's still looking for Bill Carson,</i>
5689859 5697698 <i>and in the previously deleted scene,<br />which we saw a bit back,</i>
5697825 5703035 <i>he has learned that Bill Carson<br />is a Confederate soldier.</i>
5703872 5707536 <i>So I suppose there is some kind of logic<br />that he would think</i>
5707667 5713834 <i>"Well, Carson will be captured<br />and we will find him in a prison camp."</i>
5713923 5717541 <i>I don't think that logic is too intense.</i>
5718261 5726261 <i>It's one of those little leaps<br />that Leone requires us to take on faith.</i>
5727062 5733183 <i>But, face it, that's<br />true of lots of movies,</i>
5734986 5738479 <i>that the logic of them<br />is not exactly clockwork.</i>
5738573 5743784 <i>It's sufficient that he is here,<br />he's as mean as ever...</i>
5750751 5756872 <i>Here he is, justifying his cruelty<br />to the prison commander,</i>
5756965 5762551 <i>who, it's already been established,<br />is sorely wounded</i>
5762638 5769635 <i>and pretty much on his deathbed.</i>
5770437 5772303 That an accusation?
5772439 5777434 Sergeant, gangrene is eating<br />my leg away, not my eyes.
5778070 5781358 I know the prisoners here<br />are being robbed systematically.
5781448 5784691 I know there's scum around<br />who are bivouacked near the camp,
5784785 5787994 waiting for someone to deliver this loot.
5788122 5792116 But as long as I'm commandant,<br />I won't permit any such trickery.
5792251 5794288 Am I clear?
5795337 5799422 Yes, sir.<br />Just as long as you're the commandant.
5800967 5803083 Yes, Sergeant.
5805471 5808759 I know this leg means<br />I won't last very long,
5808850 5811683 but I pray I can manage<br />to have enough time
5811811 5815770 to amass evidence<br />and bring to a court martial
5815857 5821523 all those who discredit and dishonor<br />the uniform of the Union.
5826325 5828612 I wish you luck.
5832623 5836912 <i>That's one of those sequences</i>
5837003 5840496 <i>that are almost put in<br />so that we understand</i>
5840631 5848631 <i>that only a few bad apples in the barrel<br />are spoiling an honorable cause.</i>
5851558 5855017 <i>Of course we don't<br />believe it for a moment.</i>
5875165 5882458 <i>Speaking of Morricone, this musical<br />theme here in the prison camp</i>
5882547 5887383 <i>is truly one of his most beautiful<br />and haunting themes.</i>
5889054 5896176 <i>When we've been used<br />to the kind of weird sounds</i>
5896269 5902014 <i>that he has produced<br />throughout the body of Leone's work,</i>
5902107 5908570 <i>to find this kind of lyrical,<br />almost Puccini-esque tune playing</i>
5909365 5910605 <i>is really quite wonderful.</i>
5910699 5913191 <i>And, of course, it is a precursor</i>
5913285 5920783 <i>of the much more lyrical<br />Morricone style of his later works -</i>
5920918 5927005 <i>and of course he worked for a good many<br />conventional Hollywood films</i>
5927091 5929128 <i>in his subsequent career.</i>
5929260 5936428 <i>But it is, and it will recur<br />subsequently in this sequence.</i>
5956786 5959244 <i>Ah, the poison food bit.</i>
5960957 5967294 <i>Again, the use of these conventions<br />rather casually in these movies</i>
5969299 5973839 <i>is, I think, acceptable and amusing.</i>
5973970 5980637 <i>Again, it's Leone's bow to the heritage</i>
5980727 5983389 <i>that he both loved<br />and wanted to transcend,</i>
5983479 5987473 <i>which is that of the American B-movie.</i>
6000162 6005748 <i>I love the coldness<br />with which Van Cleef plays</i>
6005834 6012206 <i>against the excitable warmth of Tuco.</i>
6013717 6018302 <i>It's a real nice emotional contrast<br />in this scene.</i>
6022142 6026511 <i>Throughout I think Angel Eyes is...</i>
6027731 6033943 <i>There's something<br />in his utter unforgiving nature</i>
6034029 6037192 <i>that's really deeply scary in this movie,</i>
6037324 6045324 <i>and I think he adds<br />sort of an element of almost profundity.</i>
6100593 6105429 <i>Here comes the Morricone theme<br />sneaking back in.</i>
6127078 6134917 <i>This sequence is, again, another direct<br />reference to Nazi concentration camps,</i>
6135003 6141249 <i>many of which,<br />as Leone was volubly aware of,</i>
6141342 6147384 <i>contained orchestras which were<br />composed of the inmates of the camp</i>
6147474 6155473 <i>and who, to use the title of a television<br />show about one of those orchestras,</i>
6156273 6160141 <i>were obliged to play for their lives.</i>
6180047 6188047 <i>And you'll see in this orchestra<br />a young soldier weeping with anguish</i>
6188514 6196514 <i>over the fact that he knows his music is<br />covering the sounds of this brutal beating.</i>
6197314 6204777 <i>But in</i> The New York Times <i>review<br />of this movie, written by Renata Adler -</i>
6204862 6211450 <i>her review was entitled<br />"The Burn, the Gouge and the Mangle" -</i>
6211536 6218374 <i>she wrote that "anyone who'd voluntarily<br />stay in the theater beyond this scene</i>
6218501 6223837 <i>is not someone I should care to meet<br />in any capacity ever."</i>
6223923 6227837 <i>Meaning that she found this scene<br />of Tuco's torture</i>
6227927 6232171 <i>by Angel Eyes and Wallace, his associate,</i>
6232265 6237806 <i>to be just beyond the beyond<br />in terms of brutality.</i>
6237895 6245895 <i>And to her it is the controlling image<br />of this movie, which she utterly despised -</i>
6248072 6254693 <i>ignoring the fact that in these cutaways<br />to the listening prisoners</i>
6254786 6257494 <i>and in particular to the orchestra</i>
6257581 6264795 <i>an enormous amount<br />of answering compassion is expressed.</i>
6266089 6272461 <i>You can't deny<br />that this is a truly brutal scene.</i>
6272596 6278968 <i>On the other hand,<br />we're talking 1966 and we're in 2003,</i>
6279102 6283391 <i>and though it's ugly</i>
6287319 6295319 <i>I don't think it exceeds anything like<br />our current standards of brutality.</i>
6304126 6306493 <i>This is the shot I was referring to earlier</i>
6306629 6314629 <i>of the young soldier<br />who is all too aware of what his role is</i>
6315137 6319472 <i>in covering this brutality.</i>
6320267 6323601 <i>And the tear is significant.</i>
6324480 6327472 <i>And so is his reaction here.</i>
6334949 6342822 <i>I think also the Adler review is totally<br />unaware of the irony portrayed here -</i>
6342957 6346791 <i>the sheer beauty of the music</i>
6346877 6353998 <i>in contrast to the brutality of the action<br />inside the headquarters of the camp.</i>
6356511 6362507 <i>I don't think it's a scene<br />of pure brutality or pure sadism.</i>
6376698 6382034 <i>The avidity of that close-up<br />is kind of remarkable too.</i>
6392922 6395084 <i>Nobody can withstand this torment,</i>
6395216 6403179 <i>and of course Tuco must give up<br />the partial information he has</i>
6403265 6406508 <i>about the whereabouts of the gold.</i>
6433045 6440418 <i>Interesting here, in that the ostensible<br />hero is not going to be tortured.</i>
6442304 6445012 <i>What's going to happen is that, of course,</i>
6445098 6451434 <i>Angel Eyes is going to try<br />and make common cause with the hero.</i>
6537856 6544273 <i>Nice moment there, where Angel Eyes<br />recognizes, perhaps for the first time,</i>
6544362 6550778 <i>that this is the most adept gun in the<br />West and that he has taken on a partner</i>
6550868 6557865 <i>who, in the end, would be<br />infinitely more dangerous than Tuco.</i>
6564923 6569042 <i>This is a reference<br />to the Brady wartime photographs</i>
6569178 6573672 <i>that are extremely significant in terms<br />of the visual design of this picture.</i>
6573765 6578225 <i>I mean, he pored over Brady photographs,<br />Leone did,</i>
6578353 6584440 <i>in order to get a sense<br />of Civil War battlefields,</i>
6584568 6589688 <i>even though there were very few<br />Civil War battlefields in the Far West.</i>
6589781 6594821 <i>He did find one such<br />minor engagement in Texas.</i>
6594912 6598074 <i>He was very proud<br />of the fact that he'd found that</i>
6598206 6604543 <i>because official histories that he had read</i>
6604629 6611501 <i>had not made much reference<br />to the war in the West -</i>
6611594 6615132 <i>which was, admittedly, a minor theater.</i>
6615264 6620430 <i>But he was very proud of the fact<br />that there was historical justification</i>
6620561 6627479 <i>for setting at least some Civil War combat<br />in the American West.</i>
6673822 6680159 <i>Tuco has become, in effect, useless now<br />to Angel Eyes and his confederate -</i>
6680287 6682119 <i>or confederates -</i>
6682205 6689327 <i>and he's obviously being taken<br />away for the last time</i>
6691131 6697172 <i>and this is a train journey,<br />ostensibly, to his death.</i>
6701640 6705508 <i>Here is another of the restored scenes,</i>
6705644 6712016 <i>and it's a little bit more enigmatic<br />why the sequence that we're about to see</i>
6712151 6720115 <i>was cut out of the American release print,<br />because it involves an actual shoot-out</i>
6720200 6726196 <i>and one that features the star of the film,<br />Clint Eastwood.</i>
6726332 6732874 <i>And it's not a particularly lengthy thing -<br />it's a little under two minutes.</i>
6735924 6742887 <i>I guess you could argue that it perhaps<br />doesn't particularly advance the plot,</i>
6743015 6745473 <i>but what it does advance</i>
6745559 6753558 <i>is something of the relationship<br />between Angel Eyes and Blondie.</i>
6754233 6762233 <i>In other words, they have<br />established a more cynical</i>
6765578 6773578 <i>and mutually-using<br />and also wary relationship,</i>
6773753 6777337 <i>as compared<br />to Blondie's relationship with Tuco.</i>
6777423 6780916 ...Four, five, six.
6781386 6784549 Six. Perfect number.
6786140 6792307 <i>That is to say it's the perfect number<br />because he carries a six-shooter.</i>
6801947 6804564 <i>Were he not quite such an evil figure,</i>
6804658 6809198 <i>you could imagine those two guys<br />having an actual friendly relationship -</i>
6809287 6812370 <i>which indeed they did have<br />in</i> For a Few Dollars More,
6812457 6816746 <i>which is really quite<br />a lovely male relationship</i>
6816837 6823675 <i>between Lee Van Cleef's character and<br />Clint's character in that earlier movie.</i>
6826930 6832721 <i>In that picture the Van Cleef character<br />is a very haunted character</i>
6832811 6839274 <i>because he's searching for revenge<br />for a particularly evil depredation</i>
6839359 6844980 <i>against the woman he loves,<br />who was his sister, actually.</i>
6847324 6852819 <i>So this is, for Van Cleef,<br />I guess you'd say kind of a reversion</i>
6852955 6855868 <i>to what he had typically played<br />in American westerns,</i>
6856000 6862417 <i>which was usually as a second<br />or third gunman - but not a good guy.</i>
6862506 6870004 <i>Probably his best role as a sympathetic<br />character was in</i> For a Few Dollars More.
6900251 6907419 <i>The unfortunate but yet totally evil<br />sergeant is played by Mario Brega,</i>
6907550 6915344 <i>who was, again, part of Leone's<br />more or less regular company in his films.</i>
6920730 6923643 <i>The scene that we're coming up to now,</i>
6923733 6931231 <i>which involves Tuco getting himself<br />cut loose from his captor,</i>
6933952 6937411 <i>was for Eli -</i>
6938873 6946245 <i>whose guardian angel Clint was<br />apparently not around for this sequence -</i>
6947256 6950465 <i>was a pretty dangerous sequence,</i>
6951927 6957923 <i>which we will shortly see.</i>
6959726 6965096 <i>Obviously the way to break his chain</i>
6965232 6971820 <i>is to hope that a train will come along<br />and break the chain.</i>
6973740 6975981 <i>The trouble from Eli's point of view</i>
6976118 6983912 <i>is that he was very very close<br />to the passing train</i>
6984001 6989167 <i>and in the first take of the sequence</i>
6993635 6995750 <i>was uncomfortably too close,</i>
6995845 7003093 <i>and so Leone had to dig a somewhat<br />deeper trench for him to be in.</i>
7003185 7011185 <i>He survived the first take<br />by the hair of his chino y-chin-chin,</i>
7012153 7020153 <i>and then got himself into a more<br />comfortable situation for the second take.</i>
7020328 7022365 <i>But, as Clint kept saying,</i>
7023706 7029998 <i>Italian film-making was a rough-and-ready<br />occupation in those days.</i>
7030129 7032336 <i>In fact, on the earlier Leone pictures</i>
7032465 7038677 <i>they had no amenities of the kind<br />that American stars are used to.</i>
7038804 7041967 <i>There weren't even any honey wagons.</i>
7042058 7048679 <i>If you had to relieve yourself, you went<br />out behind a rock in Almería, Spain.</i>
7049689 7052807 <i>Things were somewhat better</i>
7052901 7055859 <i>by the time they were making</i><br />Good, Bad and the Ugly,
7055987 7060697 <i>but still you had to keep yourself alert.</i>
7069167 7074913 <i>The casual brutality of a scene like that</i>
7076383 7079216 <i>is something that was<br />certainly a Leone specialty.</i>
7079344 7087138 <i>It certainly fitted<br />with his vision of American life.</i>
7087227 7089810 <i>One of the things<br />that happened with Leone</i>
7089896 7093855 <i>was that he had idealized<br />and romanticized Americans</i>
7093942 7097104 <i>based on his reading<br />of American popular fiction.</i>
7097236 7100274 <i>Then he encountered Americans<br />as a young guy</i>
7100406 7103319 <i>when the Americans invaded Italy,</i>
7103409 7108825 <i>and found, as he said, that Americans<br />were less romantic and less idealistic.</i>
7108914 7114080 <i>They were perfectly happy<br />to participate in the black market,</i>
7114211 7121049 <i>they were perfectly happy to exploit<br />women as prostitutes in war-torn Italy.</i>
7121135 7127177 <i>So his vision of America darkened<br />and his vision of Americans darkened.</i>
7127266 7135266 <i>And that is something of what went into<br />his creation of films like this one</i>
7137443 7140401 <i>and the previous</i> Dollar <i>films.</i>
7141155 7143692 <i>He, I don't think, ever entirely lost</i>
7143782 7150073 <i>his visionary love<br />of the expansiveness of America,</i>
7150163 7154828 <i>but he came to take what he thought of<br />as a more realistic view</i>
7154959 7157747 <i>of the American character.</i>
7159630 7167630 <i>And certainly the characters played<br />by Angel Eyes or Wallace, his assistant,</i>
7169182 7175679 <i>are examples of Leone's<br />increasing postwar cynicism.</i>
7195165 7198624 <i>Now here we are in a disused hotel.</i>
7200045 7204209 <i>One of the things that's interesting<br />about this movie in particular</i>
7204341 7211509 <i>is how people keep getting detached<br />from where they're supposed to be.</i>
7211640 7219058 <i>They kind of wander about<br />and wander back into relationships</i>
7219189 7224810 <i>that you would think would be over<br />in the normal course of existence.</i>
7225570 7231065 <i>That's kind of what's gonna happen<br />subsequent to this sequence.</i>
7231201 7239201 <i>In other words, how it is that Eli Wallach<br />happens to wander to the very same town</i>
7240043 7246254 <i>that Clint and Lee Van Cleef<br />are also wandering toward.</i>
7248050 7249791 <i>Yeah, they're still pursuing the gold</i>
7249885 7254630 <i>and we imagine perhaps that this town<br />is somehow on the road to the cemetery</i>
7254723 7257636 <i>where that gold is buried,</i>
7257726 7265726 <i>but it's very coincidental<br />and kind of non-intentional.</i>
7270030 7274695 <i>It has already been established<br />that Eli Wallach stinks like a pig</i>
7274785 7280997 <i>from his prison and other experiences<br />at the hands of Angel Eyes,</i>
7281083 7285668 <i>so this is kind of a nicely motivated<br />little moment here.</i>
7285754 7291591 <i>And it leads to, I think,<br />one of the best gags in the picture.</i>
7341309 7347304 <i>Yeah - he was in fact<br />the first close-up we saw in this picture.</i>
7362162 7365780 <i>Never use one bullet where four will do.</i>
7371296 7373537 When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.
7373632 7374997 <i>[RICHARD LAUGHS]</i>
7377010 7379877 <i>Again, we've certainly<br />seen that sequence before,</i>
7380013 7386305 <i>where the bad guy - or the more bad guy -<br />talks instead of shooting,</i>
7386395 7390730 <i>but it's a nicely staged little sequence.</i>
7430187 7434522 <i>One of the things that, of course,<br />is notable about Italian westerns</i>
7434608 7439523 <i>is that most dialogue<br />is not recorded on the set.</i>
7439613 7443651 <i>At most they would use<br />whatever sound they took</i>
7443742 7451742 <i>as guide tracks for subsequent dubbing<br />of the actual soundtrack for the film.</i>
7453918 7458082 <i>And that was probably<br />largely true in this movie.</i>
7462635 7467300 <i>Clint, on the first<br />picture,</i> Fistful of Dollars,
7467432 7473303 <i>was utterly convinced<br />that Italians would lose the guide tracks,</i>
7473438 7476806 <i>so that they would be<br />in a difficult position</i>
7476900 7479016 <i>should they want to dub it into English.</i>
7479110 7486904 <i>And in fact that happened, and Clint had<br />kept his script and had kept careful notes</i>
7486993 7491738 <i>of the changes that had occurred -<br />as they always do on films -</i>
7491831 7495869 <i>when dialogue<br />was actually recorded in scenes.</i>
7495959 7500544 <i>So he was in possession<br />on</i> A Fistful of Dollars
7500631 7503999 <i>of the only authentic record...</i>
7539837 7542078 I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.
7542172 7543286 <i>[RICHARD LAUGHS]</i>
7543381 7545873 <i>That's a great line there.</i>
7564026 7566643 It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.
7571367 7575361 <i>We have the sense<br />that that may well happen.</i>
7592263 7598429 <i>I love the way the war just keeps casually<br />intruding upon these guys' adventures.</i>
7598560 7602895 <i>You know, they're sitting around<br />and the next thing you know</i>
7603023 7610020 <i>a huge cannonball is landing in the middle<br />of this already virtually ruined town.</i>
7611072 7614360 <i>And I think that is a statement<br />that Leone is making -</i>
7614451 7619571 <i>it's about the provisionality<br />and accidental qualities of modern life.</i>
7619706 7627706 <i>That a lot of living and dying<br />in the modern violent world...</i>
7630383 7635799 <i>And we must remember that the Civil War<br />was, in some sense, the first modern war,</i>
7635931 7640266 <i>the first war where<br />truly mass killing was taking place.</i>
7640393 7647435 <i>And this notion of the<br />provisionality of life,</i>
7647566 7650775 <i>the casualness with which<br />it can be taken from us,</i>
7650903 7656489 <i>is something that was very much<br />on his very European mind -</i>
7656617 7662238 <i>and the European mind had certainly<br />been conditioned by the horrors of WWII.</i>
7662331 7670331 <i>So this is a sequence that I think,<br />particularly in the way it's set up,</i>
7672299 7680299 <i>although it kind of works out as<br />a conventional street-shooting sequence,</i>
7680683 7685177 <i>certainly starts out as something<br />that has a little bit more to say</i>
7685312 7693311 <i>about the casual way<br />in which life can be snuffed out.</i>
7726352 7730846 <i>I don't think that Leone,<br />in his previous two westerns,</i>
7730982 7735943 <i>had all the wherewithal<br />that he had in this film</i>
7736029 7743242 <i>to do the kind of coverage that he rather<br />obviously did in sequences like this.</i>
7743368 7751082 <i>But I think - and it's certainly true<br />of his later, more epic films,</i>
7751209 7755919 <i>the</i> Once Upon a Time <i>films, as it were -</i>
7756048 7764048 <i>he certainly by then had the wherewithal<br />to do as much coverage as he wanted</i>
7766892 7772729 <i>and to put the film together<br />very much in the editing room.</i>
7789581 7797580 <i>One of things you do notice<br />in this walk-down against the bad guys -</i>
7798214 7802424 <i>and there is certainly a reference here,<br />I think, to</i> High Noon,
7802551 7810551 <i>in which, in that case, one lone lawman<br />has to take on a gang of about this size.</i>
7812812 7815304 <i>It certainly is a reference to that.</i>
7815439 7823439 <i>But I think there's more humor<br />in the way that Leone stages this scene</i>
7825116 7828404 <i>than, say, Fred Zinnemann did<br />in</i> High Noon.
7828494 7833034 <i>I think there is a kind of<br />post-modernist awareness</i>
7833124 7841124 <i>that you can't quite take these<br />highly conventionalized sequences</i>
7841923 7849923 <i>as seriously, as melodramatically as was<br />previously the case in classic westerns.</i>
7850306 7852422 <i>Funny line here.</i>
7852517 7855054 "Idiots."
7855145 7856556 It's for you.
7856646 7858102 <i>[RICHARD LAUGHS]</i>
7862360 7868982 <i>Again, notice the way, whenever there's<br />a zinger like "Idiots. It's for you",</i>
7869117 7871108 <i>Morricone's score pops in there</i>
7871202 7879202 <i>just to give a nice little ironic, humorous<br />emphasis to the humor of the line.</i>
7899855 7906227 <i>Where Eli is taking him is really<br />to the moral center of this movie.</i>
7906361 7909729 <i>It's something I've obviously<br />alluded to before,</i>
7909865 7917865 <i>but it is to a meaningless<br />and brutal conflict</i>
7918540 7921658 <i>in which two armies<br />are drawn up on either side of a river</i>
7921752 7927373 <i>and they are contending<br />for the bridge that controls the river.</i>
7927508 7930341 <i>There are new shots in this sequence</i>
7930427 7934512 <i>that were cut from<br />the original American release print.</i>
7934598 7941685 <i>The sequence in particular, I think,<br />is a reference to World War I,</i>
7941771 7944012 <i>not to World War II in this case,</i>
7944106 7950352 <i>because what we're seeing is an<br />enormously elaborate system of trenches,</i>
7950446 7952437 <i>and that was a trench war,</i>
7952573 7959070 <i>and it was a war in which<br />the slaughter in the trenches</i>
7959205 7963824 <i>had become, as we historically<br />look at World War I,</i>
7963918 7966956 <i>an unconscionable waste of lives.</i>
7967088 7972549 <i>But it was a waste of lives<br />in a static warfare</i>
7972635 7977471 <i>in which neither side could advance<br />particularly or retreat particularly,</i>
7977598 7980886 <i>and yet men in their hundreds<br />of thousands were killed</i>
7980977 7987098 <i>for these pitiful advantages -<br />50 yards, 100 yards -</i>
7987233 7990941 <i>which was then taken back<br />by the other side in the next day or two.</i>
7991069 7995484 <i>So this is a direct reference<br />by Sergio Leone</i>
7995615 8003615 <i>to the waste of earlier modern warfare -<br />that is to say, World War I warfare.</i>
8007502 8012087 <i>World War II was not, of course,<br />particularly a war of trench warfare.</i>
8021850 8024137 So you want to enlist.
8025103 8027970 You gotta take a test to prove it.
8036698 8038985 Well, show me.
8042870 8047615 <i>What he is really saying implicitly,<br />and will shortly say explicitly,</i>
8047708 8055708 <i>is that he who will survive this war<br />is the man who can keep himself drunk,</i>
8058344 8061553 <i>and thus half oblivious to its waste.</i>
8062181 8066470 You've got a career.<br />At the least I'd say you'll make colonel.
8066560 8069222 -Really?<br />-Sure.
8069355 8071517 Like it says in the manual,
8071649 8077110 you've got every qualification to become<br />an expert in the use of weapons.
8077196 8081315 For this, sir,<br />is the most potent weapon in war.
8083994 8087328 The fighting spirit's in this bottle.
8106391 8108849 <i>It's an interesting concept, that one -</i>
8108935 8116935 <i>the drunken commander of a rather<br />large unit in a rather large battle.</i>
8119487 8123446 <i>I'm not particularly familiar<br />with the drunken -</i>
8123574 8128785 <i>or at least drunk-on-duty -<br />officer in war films.</i>
8128913 8134408 <i>So it's kind of an interesting,<br />novel conceit on Leone's part.</i>
8160485 8167573 <i>See, what this officer<br />in his drunkenness understands</i>
8167659 8174452 <i>is that these are guys<br />who are kind of picaresque heroes -</i>
8174541 8182460 <i>that is to say, heroes<br />who are on an adventurous quest,</i>
8182549 8187885 <i>the goal of which<br />is less important than the quest itself.</i>
8187971 8195970 <i>The journey being<br />of more interest than the goal.</i>
8196145 8201731 <i>And I think that's a true enough<br />Leone characterization</i>
8201817 8205481 <i>of what's going on with these guys.</i>
8243024 8248144 It's a court-martial of fence to imagine,<br />to dream of blowing it up. A serious crime.
8248238 8253199 Even to think of destroying<br />that bridge is just...
8255078 8258036 Why not really blow it up, Captain?
8259082 8262200 <i>Now there's a good idea.</i>
8262877 8266245 <i>And, of course, that's what the freelance</i>
8266381 8269999 <i>or picaresque character in a movie<br />can always do.</i>
8270093 8278093 <i>I mean, without allegiance<br />to any larger group or larger ideology,</i>
8278560 8282178 <i>he - or they, in this case -<br />can just look at the situation</i>
8282272 8287358 <i>and say "Why don't we just<br />think outside the box on this one?"</i>
8287443 8292562 <i>And that's, of course,<br />what is going to happen.</i>
8293740 8301740 <i>There the first explosions<br />betoken the daily attack</i>
8303417 8308583 <i>over this, you know, insane situation.</i>
8311592 8319010 <i>This is a sequence in the film<br />that took Sergio and his company</i>
8319099 8321887 <i>away from where they were used<br />to shooting in Spain,</i>
8321977 8326687 <i>which was in Almería in the flat,<br />hot, desert-like plains of the south,</i>
8326773 8328639 <i>into the north of the country</i>
8328775 8333144 <i>where, logically, you could find<br />a river in a mountain gorge</i>
8333280 8336113 <i>and all the things<br />he needed for this sequence.</i>
8341287 8346953 <i>I think you will see in this sequence and<br />in its management of very large forces -</i>
8347043 8355043 <i>much larger forces than either in<br />the</i> Dollar <i>films or earlier in this film -</i>
8356469 8362715 <i>that Leone, who had served a long, long<br />apprenticeship as an assistant director,</i>
8362808 8369930 <i>often working for American directors<br />like Raoul Walsh and Robert Wise in Italy,</i>
8370024 8372106 <i>where American companies came</i>
8372193 8378064 <i>because it was cheaper<br />to shoot epics in Italy,</i>
8378157 8382401 <i>where the salaries were low<br />and the unions nonexistent.</i>
8382495 8388366 <i>And he learned his craft. He really knew<br />how to handle large-scale forces.</i>
8388501 8390537 <i>It was not just practical experience.</i>
8390669 8394128 <i>If you look at this sequence,<br />you can certainly see</i>
8394214 8402214 <i>references to classic war films -<br />certainly some shots that put me in mind</i>
8403056 8407926 <i>of some of the shots in Milestone's</i><br />All Quiet on the Western Front,
8408019 8411728 <i>or Kubrick's</i> Paths of Glory.
8411856 8419855 <i>You know, these are kind of<br />classic pieces of film-making by Leone.</i>
8422367 8426031 <i>A big difference here, I think,</i>
8426121 8434121 <i>is that as the two objective observers,<br />if you will, Tuco and Blondie, watch,</i>
8436881 8443252 <i>Clint speaks what amounts<br />to the essential moral -</i>
8443387 8445674 <i>certainly of this sequence.</i>
8445764 8450554 <i>Cos he speaks,<br />as you will very shortly hear,</i>
8450644 8458644 <i>of the simple waste of men over<br />a meaningless object of contention.</i>
8463073 8467067 I've never seen so many men<br />wasted so badly.
8470039 8477708 <i>Is it possible that Blondie<br />has all along been a secret moralist?</i>
8477796 8485510 <i>I don't know, but I think there is that<br />movement in the character Clint's playing,</i>
8485596 8493595 <i>that he is perhaps a better man than he<br />knows or wants to publicly acknowledge.</i>
8513623 8518709 What would happen<br />if somebody were to blow up that bridge?
8518795 8520957 Yeah.
8521047 8524540 Then these idiots<br />would go somewhere else to fight.
8524634 8526625 Maybe.
8527804 8534392 <i>There is the crazy logic of what's<br />going to happen in the next few minutes.</i>
8535978 8540562 <i>Obviously, if you remove<br />the object of contention,</i>
8540649 8548649 <i>you will remove the thing<br />that's blocking their way to the cemetery.</i>
8554204 8557993 <i>In this sequence -<br />and I think it may be just there,</i>
8558083 8564375 <i>where we saw Clint and Eli<br />having to duck down from that explosion -</i>
8566925 8573922 <i>Clint had felt that they were too close<br />to where the explosives were going off</i>
8574015 8578976 <i>and had proposed to Eli<br />that they move back at least a few steps,</i>
8579062 8581269 <i>to be out of harm's way.</i>
8581356 8585350 <i>And that proved to be the case.</i>
8585444 8589858 <i>Although whether it was this sequence<br />or a subsequent sequence I'm not certain.</i>
8589947 8593861 <i>Could have been both of them.<br />But, again, it proved Clint's point -</i>
8593951 8601039 <i>that making movies Italian-style<br />could be dangerous.</i>
8617016 8621476 Take a slug of this, Captain.<br />And keep your ears open.
8626192 8631904 <i>See, again, that's one of the<br />advantages of the freelance life -</i>
8631989 8635823 <i>these guys aren't under anybody's orders.</i>
8637411 8641074 <i>These guys can do whatever they want<br />to advance their own particular needs.</i>
8641247 8643534 <i>So they're going to do two things.</i>
8643625 8647038 <i>One large, good thing,<br />which is to blow up the bridge</i>
8647128 8654546 <i>and end this endless,<br />bloodthirsty, life-draining battle,</i>
8654636 8657469 <i>but that will also, of course,<br />clear their way</i>
8657597 8662137 <i>toward their own<br />more personal and private goal.</i>
8684999 8689242 <i>The point that's being made<br />in this sequence</i>
8689336 8696129 <i>is a point Charlie Chaplin, oddly enough,<br />had made almost 20 years earlier</i>
8696218 8697925 <i>in</i> Monsieur Verdoux,
8698011 8706011 <i>where his character Verdoux<br />was killing women for their money</i>
8708313 8713353 <i>and is caught and makes<br />a defense of himself in the trial,</i>
8713443 8719815 <i>"and says " My crimes are paltry<br />compared to the crimes of nations,</i>
8719908 8726826 <i>which are blowing up one another" -<br />by that time with atomic weapons -</i>
8726915 8731705 <i>and doing it, as he says,<br />very scientifically.</i>
8734715 8742383 <i>Leone specifically referred<br />to that business in</i> Monsieur Verdoux,
8742471 8749434 <i>saying that he was trying to say<br />the exact same thing in this sequence -</i>
8749520 8757520 <i>that the crimes that Blondie and Tuco<br />are certainly overtly pursuing</i>
8763534 8771534 <i>are nothing compared to the nearly<br />genocidal murders they move through</i>
8773544 8778880 <i>and here, at the bridge,<br />get intimately involved with.</i>
8813583 8820250 <i>This is, of course,<br />one of those lengthy processes</i>
8820340 8828340 <i>by which vast objects are wired<br />for their ultimate destruction.</i>
8832686 8838101 <i>The point here is, of course, to<br />inter-cut it with the more intimate scenes</i>
8838190 8840807 <i>of the colonel</i>
8843779 8847272 <i>coming to his last.</i>
8848867 8853327 <i>What's good about<br />the structure of this sequence</i>
8853455 8861455 <i>is that while these guys<br />are arranging to blow up the bridge,</i>
8866802 8874802 <i>a point is being made - that they know<br />that the colonel is gonna die,</i>
8876145 8879137 <i>and it's in a funny way<br />their little gift to him,</i>
8879231 8887230 <i>that they will take care of destroying<br />the object that has destroyed him.</i>
8894495 8897829 <i>So it's kind of a nice irony<br />they're working on here</i>
8897915 8902876 <i>and it comes to a nice conclusion<br />when the bridge finally goes up</i>
8903004 8907589 <i>and it's virtually the last thing<br />the colonel hears.</i>
8960393 8966765 <i>Now, it is important to understand that<br />this bridge had to be blown up twice.</i>
8966900 8974900 <i>The verbal signal that Leone had arranged<br />with his explosives guy</i>
8976451 8979569 <i>he accidentally uttered</i>
8979663 8985329 <i>before his cameras were entirely ready<br />to record that destruction.</i>
8986585 8989122 <i>So it went unrecorded,</i>
8989255 8993340 <i>and there was a delay<br />of at least a week or ten days</i>
8993425 8997089 <i>while the whole bridge had to be rebuilt.</i>
8997179 9000012 <i>Leone was, of course, furious</i>
9000099 9006846 <i>as only he could be furious,<br />in a slightly comical, Italianate way,</i>
9006939 9009601 <i>but it was a miserable misunderstanding.</i>
9009692 9017692 <i>And although the budget was fair-sized on<br />this movie, it certainty delayed shooting.</i>
9089519 9096733 <i>Kind of a comic arrangement<br />of Clint and Eli in that sequence.</i>
9104117 9108702 <i>And now, after all those weeks<br />and months, it's over.</i>
9112084 9115952 <i>The armies have magically withdrawn.</i>
9118382 9125755 <i>The way is clear<br />for them to head for Sad Hill</i>
9125889 9131305 <i>and the long-awaited conclusion<br />to this movie.</i>
9131395 9135639 <i>But not before there is<br />a lovely little sequence</i>
9135731 9139725 <i>that we're shortly going to encounter.</i>
9175730 9177937 <i>I think, as a director,</i>
9178024 9185817 <i>that Clint learned something about<br />spaciousness and spectacle from Leone.</i>
9188450 9194662 <i>He always liked that. He uses the word<br />"spectacle" when he talks about Leone.</i>
9194789 9202412 <i>And I think he did acquire<br />some sense of that from Leone.</i>
9202505 9206419 <i>Now here's one of Leone's<br />bare, ruined choirs.</i>
9206509 9212505 <i>It's a church that's been bombed<br />out of any useful existence,</i>
9214559 9222559 <i>but it becomes the setting for, I think, one<br />of the nicest little sequences in the film.</i>
9224694 9231987 <i>Again, one of those sequences that the<br />critics of the time persistently ignored.</i>
9232077 9234239 <i>But what we have here is a place</i>
9234329 9239368 <i>where obviously some skirmish<br />in the larger battle had taken place,</i>
9239500 9247500 <i>and Clint comes along<br />and finds this very young dying soldier.</i>
9251220 9257557 <i>He recognizes that this kid<br />is not gonna live for long.</i>
9261688 9266433 <i>He covers him with his own coat,</i>
9266527 9272694 <i>which is an act that has<br />certain Biblical overtones to it,</i>
9272783 9280783 <i>and more than that, shares with<br />the dying soldier his trademark cigar.</i>
9284044 9291040 <i>Just recognize that, when he finally<br />acknowledged Tuco's humanity</i>
9291134 9297346 <i>back there after the mission sequence,<br />he also shared his cigar with him.</i>
9297431 9300765 <i>So it is a symbolic act,</i>
9301602 9304390 <i>and, you know,</i>
9306440 9314029 <i>there's a quality in this thing<br />that we have not seen</i>
9314115 9322115 <i>in any of Clint's previous work for Leone,<br />this compassionate moment.</i>
9324834 9332673 <i>And, just incidentally there,<br />he picks up the other symbolic item</i>
9332758 9339754 <i>from his previous Leone work,<br />which is his famous serape,</i>
9339848 9344467 <i>and prepares for what I think<br />is one of the best gags in the movie.</i>
9344603 9346935 <i>Maybe one of the best Clint gags ever.</i>
9347022 9352938 <i>You know, the famous guy with<br />the .44 Magnum, a toter of big guns,</i>
9353028 9358239 <i>here fires absolutely<br />the biggest gun of his career</i>
9358325 9361443 <i>with uncanny accuracy, one might say.</i>
9361536 9366656 <i>You have to remember that there is<br />a magical element in Leone's film-making.</i>
9366750 9369367 <i>The magical use of that gun</i>
9373381 9375964 <i>is terrific.</i>
9376051 9384051 <i>And the second shot, for heaven's sakes,<br />brings Tuco to Sad Hill.</i>
9388062 9390474 <i>And it's a wonderful shot -</i>
9390564 9393477 <i>the notion of the gun<br />stunning him and rolling,</i>
9393567 9395683 <i>and he's rolling right into the place</i>
9395819 9401405 <i>that these guys have been trying<br />to get to for most of the movie.</i>
9404870 9409785 <i>And this is a sequence<br />that meant a lot to Leone.</i>
9409875 9417623 <i>He had guys out digging graves for<br />well over a week to set up this sequence.</i>
9417716 9421004 <i>Incidentally, there's the dog again.</i>
9422596 9430596 <i>Because he wanted to show the endless,<br />screen-filling depth of war's horror.</i>
9437193 9440982 <i>I mean, it's just grave<br />after grave after grave.</i>
9441072 9446442 <i>Now, he had brought his previous film,</i><br />For a Few Dollars More,
9446536 9454535 <i>to a conclusion like this one,<br />in a kind of graveyard shoot-out.</i>
9458548 9465887 <i>But this is the masterpiece<br />of that kind of film-making.</i>
9469517 9474557 <i>Where Eli has come to in this sequence<br />is, I suppose, a plaza</i>
9474647 9482486 <i>that was intended to be the central<br />ceremonial place of this graveyard.</i>
9482572 9485484 <i>I imagine somebody might've imagined</i>
9485574 9492071 <i>that they would do Memorial Day services<br />in this central plaza.</i>
9493290 9501290 <i>But it's the circle in which the three<br />principals will become entrapped</i>
9503842 9505753 <i>for the conclusion of this movie.</i>
9525280 9531071 <i>I think a lesser director would have done<br />a lesser amount of running around</i>
9531161 9534653 <i>in this sequence, but...</i>
9539210 9545877 <i>I don't know. As I say, with a Leone film,<br />especially the later, grander Leone films,</i>
9545966 9553555 <i>you really have to let the man set<br />his own pace and do what he wants to do.</i>
9553891 9559057 <i>It's amazing to me, as long as they were<br />cutting this film for its initial release,</i>
9559146 9561683 <i>you could've cut a lot of this sequence</i>
9561816 9568688 <i>without consequence to<br />the narrative understanding of the film.</i>
9568823 9572566 <i>Some of the other cuts do interfere<br />with our understanding of the film.</i>
9573160 9576949 <i>But that didn't happen.</i>
9577039 9581579 <i>This sequence plays<br />at its extensive length.</i>
9581669 9587254 <i>And we are now arrived<br />at where he thinks he has to be -</i>
9587340 9590378 <i>at the grave of Arch Stanton.</i>
9594055 9596217 <i>One of the things you have to say</i>
9596349 9602937 <i>about this supposedly shrewd<br />and knowing character that Eli is playing</i>
9603022 9605389 <i>is he's really very innocent.</i>
9605525 9608108 <i>He basically believes everything<br />everybody tells him,</i>
9608194 9611186 <i>usually to his ultimate sorrow.</i>
9655741 9657857 <i>Clint's theme.</i>
9657951 9661319 <i>Oh, and look, he's got the serape on.</i>
9665751 9668118 <i>That's not accidental.</i>
9669338 9672126 <i>He has never worn it before in this movie.</i>
9672257 9679596 <i>And also the little sheepskin vest that<br />he wore under it in the previous movies.</i>
9679681 9687178 <i>He is back now, in this sequence,<br />to his full mythic height.</i>
9688981 9694192 <i>This is the Man With No Name,<br />fully costumed...</i>
9697114 9698775 <i>Oops.</i>
9700034 9703902 <i>See, nobody's quite paying attention,<br />they're so busy digging,</i>
9703996 9707159 <i>realizing their greedy ambitions.</i>
9707250 9710584 <i>So everybody<br />has sneaked up on everybody.</i>
9739406 9744901 <i>The crossing has been wonderful with Eli.<br />They're parodistic crossings,</i>
9744995 9749364 <i>which we've seen a number<br />of times before in the movie.</i>
9819902 9821813 <i>Wonderful visual here.</i>
9821904 9826398 <i>They're in a circle<br />and they've formed a kind of a triangle.</i>
9826909 9834577 <i>And we are at the shoot-out.</i>
9834707 9838541 <i>But I love the geometry of the sequence.</i>
9841422 9844631 <i>Something really rather classical about it.</i>
9856396 9861482 <i>And, again, this is a sequence</i>
9861567 9867483 <i>that becomes almost a kind<br />of signature piece for Leone,</i>
9867573 9875573 <i>in that it takes a very long time<br />and a lot of lookin'</i>
9876916 9882286 <i>before the action of the piece<br />can possibly begin.</i>
9904317 9907560 <i>The triangle re-formed<br />and re-formed again...</i>
9907654 9910487 <i>It's a beautifully covered sequence.</i>
9913368 9918659 <i>And novel, in that<br />there are not an awful lot of westerns</i>
9918749 9923289 <i>with a three-way face-down<br />at their conclusion.</i>
9923378 9925210 <i>Usually two is plenty.</i>
9925297 9933260 <i>Usually the extra male or men have been<br />dispensed with in an earlier sequence</i>
9933345 9939091 <i>so that there can be a final confrontation<br />between good and bad.</i>
9939185 9945557 <i>But this movie, from its very title, tells us<br />that there are three types of guy in this -</i>
9945649 9947890 <i>the good, the bad and the ugly.</i>
9948527 9952691 <i>So they have to come<br />to this triangular shoot-out.</i>
9988817 9992481 <i>A long time.<br />A lot of wide shots, a lot of close-ups,</i>
9992570 9998316 <i>just like we said at the very beginning<br />of the film - basic Leone style.</i>
10002247 10005490 <i>And there we have<br />a close-up and long shot all in one.</i>
10041285 10043777 <i>I love the freedom of Morricone's music.</i>
10043871 10047364 <i>I mean, there's mariachi music<br />going there, modern stuff</i>
10047457 10053248 <i>He's not wedded<br />to the classical western thematic material.</i>
10053881 10061379 <i>It's movie music that refers us to the<br />present as much as it does to the past.</i>
10061471 10063587 <i>It's extraordinarily effective.</i>
10073734 10079480 <i>It's just wonderful,<br />the amount of time he takes in this.</i>
10080073 10084987 <i>The increasing tightness of the close-ups<br />on the gun and in particular the eyes.</i>
10085161 10088904 <i>That's really masterful movie-making.</i>
10089957 10092198 <i>And then the rhythm there...</i>
10115191 10117228 <i>Perfect.</i>
10122239 10124606 <i>He's even an efficient killer -</i>
10124700 10128409 <i>he gets the guy right into the grave<br />with his last shot</i>
10128537 10131528 <i>and then arranges his hat on his chest.</i>
10285899 10289563 <i>Would you say that what we have here<br />is a kind of a motif?</i>
10289653 10290893 <i>[CHUCKLES]</i>
10299121 10304958 <i>A circle. We are describing a huge circle<br />in the course of this movie.</i>
10305043 10310789 <i>We have just seen the shoot-out in the<br />circle, the noose is a sort of a circle.</i>
10310882 10318882 <i>But the fact is that one time or another<br />everybody has their heads in a noose</i>
10320517 10325057 <i>and they're standing<br />on a perilous platform -</i>
10325147 10330062 <i>in this case a pretty wobbly one,</i>
10330152 10334315 <i>but probably no more unstable<br />than being on a horse.</i>
10334405 10340822 <i>And here we are, back at virtually<br />the beginning of the movie</i>
10340911 10346748 <i>and this great vast circle<br />is about to be closed finally.</i>
10391294 10393581 <i>The only problem, of course,</i>
10393671 10398541 <i>being how in the world is Eli<br />going to get his share of the loot</i>
10398635 10402299 <i>considering the circumstances he's in?</i>
10422825 10425908 <i>Again, you've got to mention<br />religious imagery.</i>
10425995 10431330 <i>That's a very shaky cross<br />that he's standing on, but it is a cross,</i>
10431416 10439416 <i>and it says probably something about<br />Leone's spirituality, shall we say?</i>
10449184 10454600 <i>I think there's something in the<br />relationship between Blondie and Tuco</i>
10454690 10459730 <i>that reflects Clint's relationship<br />with Leone.</i>
10460362 10468362 <i>You know,<br />the excitable email-in-stature man</i>
10468787 10473247 <i>and the big, quiet guy who...</i>
10474918 10478707 <i>Both were locked in a relationship<br />that was mutually beneficial,</i>
10478797 10483836 <i>but which had by this time<br />become a pretty shaky one.</i>
10483926 10487885 <i>And it's fair to say that as Clint<br />rides of fin this last sequence</i>
10487972 10493058 <i>that he is riding out<br />of Leone country permanently.</i>
10493144 10500733 <i>But this is the end of one of<br />the great modern movie collaborations.</i>
10550950 10556161 <i>Magical. That shot is nothing but magical.</i>
10561711 10565921 <i>I think it's fair to say -<br />and nice to be able to say -</i>
10566007 10574007 <i>that despite the public difficulties Leone<br />stirred up with Clint in his later career,</i>
10574391 10577600 <i>that at the very end of Leone's life</i>
10577685 10582724 <i>Clint was in Rome,<br />Leone got in touch with him,</i>
10582815 10590815 <i>they shared very warm<br />and extensive meals together,</i>
10591365 10595199 <i>and came to a kind<br />of peaceful understanding</i>
10595327 10602324 <i>only a matter of months before Sergio<br />died prematurely of a heart condition.</i>
10604211 10607829 <i>So a kind of a peace</i>
10607923 10613885 <i>finally comes over this - by this time -<br />somewhat contentious relationship.</i>
10614012 10622012 <i>And Clint, of course, dedicated his great<br />western,</i> Unforgiven, <i>to Sergio Leone</i>
10622855 10624892 <i>and to Don Siegel,</i>
10625023 10632520 <i>the two directors he regarded as<br />his great mentors in his directing career.</i>
10633281 10636148 <i>And that's a great Leone shot</i>
10636242 10642284 <i>of the human figure being just absorbed</i>
10642373 10649791 <i>into the timeless and speechless<br />and enigmatic landscape.</i>
