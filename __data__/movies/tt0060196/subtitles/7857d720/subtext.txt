671428 673889 You're from Baker?
685400 687736 Tell Baker that I told him<br />all that I know already.
687819 689579 Tell him I want to live in<br />peace, understand?
689629 692329 There is no use to<br />go on tormenting me!
692532 695327 I know nothing at all<br />about that case of coins.
695410 697250 Now that gold has disappeared,<br />but if he'd listened,
697395 699522 we could have<br />avoided this altogether.
700707 702459 I went to the army court.
702542 704252 There were no witnesses.
704336 706672 They couldn't uncover any more.
706755 709675 I can't tell Baker<br />what happened to the money.
709758 711259 Go back and tell him that.
714096 715931 Word's around you had a visitor,
718100 719518 and Baker knows it.
721937 723438 Name of Jackson.
727150 730445 Well, Jackson was here
732739 734491 or Baker's got it all wrong.
742833 744084 He's not wrong.
745168 746628 Maybe Baker would like to know
746712 749715 just what you and<br />Jackson had to say
749798 751717 about the cash box.
755887 757764 That's not what<br />I'm being paid for.
762519 765981 I'm only interested in what<br />name Jackson's hiding under now.
769693 772362 Why do you think Jackson may<br />be assuming another name?
772446 774114 I would have found him already.
775657 778034 When I start off to find<br />somebody, I find him.
779077 780454 That's why they pay me.
786668 788211 What is Baker paying you?
791882 793008 That your family?
803518 804519 Yes.
804603 806480 Nice family.
809816 811818 What does he pay<br />you for murdering me?
815322 817115 $500
817991 819201 to get the name.
825832 827000 The name.
836885 839262 Carson. Bill Carson.
840347 842224 That's what<br />he calls himself now.
873255 875757 That's a lot of money. $1,000.
880095 881513 $1,0007?
884391 887644 And some in gold.<br />That's a tidy sum.
892232 896403 But when I'm paid,<br />I always see the job through.
969517 970602 It's you.
971436 972687 Any information?
975190 976358 Too much.
978276 980904 He said quite a bit<br />that should interest you,
980987 983698 and one or two<br />things that interested me.
983823 985033 Such as?
986242 989663 The name Jackson's<br />hiding under is Bill Carson.
992916 994376 That's your bit.
997212 998254 Keep talking.
999255 1003218 He also mentioned something<br />about a certain cash box,
1003301 1005095 which just<br />happened to disappear.
1006179 1008223 That's my bit.
1008306 1009808 Anything else?
1010517 1011893 Not enough for you, eh?
1013061 1014980 Well, you don't have to worry.
1015063 1016773 He'll never say<br />anything to anybody again.
1017399 1019359 Oh, yeah, yeah. Perfect.
1021069 1022237 Here you are.
1023113 1024823 Here. This is for you.
1024906 1026825 You did a good job for me.
1026908 1029035 Worth $500.
1031496 1034541 Yeah. I almost forgot.
1034624 1036376 He gave me $1,000.
1037293 1039629 I think his idea<br />was that I kill you.
1046970 1049431 But you know the pity is,<br />when I'm paid,
1049514 1051766 I always follow my job through.
1052517 1054019 You know that.
1054310 1055937 No! Angel Eyes...
1101232 1105278 No. No pistol, amigo.<br />It won't do you any good.
1105361 1106821 There are three of us.
1122003 1123004 Hey, amigo.
1123588 1128551 You know you've got a face<br />beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?
1130804 1131930 Yeah.
1133848 1136518 But you don't look like<br />the one who'll collect it.
1144567 1146361 A couple steps back.
1200999 1202333 Thank you.
1211843 1214053 How much are you worth now?
1214137 1215221 How much?
1216639 1218433 $2,000.
1220852 1222812 That's right, $2,000.
1222896 1224939 Yeah, $2,000.
1234282 1238536 You'll pay for this!<br />I hope you end up in a graveyard
1238620 1241539 with the cholera and the<br />rabies and the plague!
1241623 1242832 Cut me loose!
1242916 1244876 Cut me loose,<br />you filthy bastard!
1244959 1246753 Put me down!
1246836 1249631 I hope your mother ends up<br />in a two-dollar whorehouse!
1249714 1251716 Cut me loose! Cut me loose!
1253009 1255094 You can still save yourself.
1255178 1257305 Let me go, and I'll pardon you.
1258181 1260183 Let me go.
1260266 1262060 I think I feel sick.
1262143 1264979 The blood is<br />bursting through my...
1265063 1266648 I'm dry, Blondie.
1268608 1269651 Water.
1275657 1280870 You swine. You son of a bitch.<br />Let me go!
1280954 1282747 You're brave with<br />a man who's tied up!
1282830 1284540 Come back!
1284624 1288836 Come back and fight!<br />You bastard.
1290338 1291965 Who the hell is that?
1292048 1294133 One bastard goes in,<br />another comes out.
1294217 1296135 Cut it out! Cut it out!
1296219 1299555 I'm an honest farmer!<br />I'm innocent of any...
1302141 1305687 So, you're an honest farmer.<br />You recognize this man?
1305770 1306854 Me?
1306938 1308064 Yeah, it's you.
1310024 1313444 Me? Who says so?<br />You can't even read.
1313528 1315655 Yeah, roll it up. Roll it up.
1315738 1318283 I'll give you a good idea<br />where you can put it.
1318366 1321995 To hell with all you sheriffs and<br />deputies and all who gave birth to you.
1322078 1325373 Hey, everybody, look, look.<br />He's giving him the filthy money.
1325456 1328626 Judas. You sold my hide.
1328710 1330920 But you won't enjoy any of that<br />money, not a penny.
1331004 1332172 If there's justice in the world,
1332255 1333590 that money will go<br />to the undertakers.
1333673 1335008 Every penny of it.
1335091 1337176 You know who you are?
1337260 1339512 You want to know<br />whose son you are?
1339595 1341889 You don't, I do. Everybody does.
1341973 1345727 You're the son of a thousand<br />fathers, all bastards like you.
1345810 1347770 And your mother... Your mother!
1347854 1349897 She's... You bastard!
1350982 1353985 Your mother...<br />It's better not to talk of her!
1354068 1355320 I never hurt anybody!
1356112 1359699 "Wanted in 14<br />counties of this state,"
1359782 1364370 "the condemned is found guilty<br />of the crimes of murder,"
1364454 1369125 "armed robbery of citizens,<br />state banks and post offices,"
1369208 1373379 "the theft of sacred objects,<br />arson in a state prison,"

1390438 1394776 "the condemned is guilty of using<br />marked cards and loaded dice."
1394859 1398863 Therefore, according to<br />the powers vested in us,
1398946 1402033 we sentence<br />the accused here before us
1402116 1405912 Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramirez...
1405995 1407038 Known as "The Rat."
1407121 1408956 ...and any other<br />aliases he might have
1410875 1412794 to hang by the neck until dead.
1412877 1414379 May God have mercy on his soul.
1414462 1415588 Proceed.
1442490 1445993 Five for you. One, two
1446077 1448704 three, four, five for me.
1450832 1454460 Five for you and five for me.
1455753 1457922 Know how much you're worth now?
1458005 1459841 No. How much?
1459924 1461342 $3,000.
1465346 1468141 There are two kinds of people<br />in the world, my friend,
1468224 1469517 those with a rope<br />around their neck,
1469600 1472145 and the people who have the<br />job of doing the cutting.
1472228 1475565 Listen, the neck at<br />the end of the rope is mine.
1475648 1477233 I run the risks.
1478151 1481654 So the next time,<br />ll want more than half.
1481737 1485366 You may run the risks, my<br />friend, but I do the cutting.
1487535 1489662 If we cut down my percentage...
1491831 1493040 Cigar?
1494834 1496711 It's liable<br />to interfere with my aim.
1499797 1502717 But if you miss,<br />you had better miss very well.
1503759 1507472 Whoever double crosses me<br />and leaves me alive,
1507555 1510183 he understands<br />nothing about Tuco.
1511767 1512894 Nothing.
1517106 1519233 "Wanted in 15<br />counties of this state."
1519317 1521319 "The condemned<br />standing before us,"
1521402 1522987 sitting before us,
1523070 1527200 "Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria<br />Ramirez, has been found guilty"
1527283 1530328 "by the Third District Circuit<br />Court of the following crimes,"
1530411 1532955 "murder, assaulting<br />a justice of the peace,"
1533039 1535500 "raping a virgin<br />of the white race,"
1535583 1539086 "statutory rape<br />of a minor of the black race,"
1539170 1540630 "derailing a train in order<br />to rob the passengers..."
1540713 1542882 Hey, Angel Eyes.
1542965 1544884 "...bank robbery,<br />highway robbery,"
1546010 1549138 "robbing an unknown number of<br />post offices, breaking out..."
1549222 1550848 What'd you find out, Shorty?
1550932 1552850 If you ask me,<br />it seems like a book.
1552934 1555561 An armed unit escorting<br />a cash box of gold coins
1555645 1557146 meets a Yankee ambush,
1557230 1559565 and only three<br />of them are saved.
1559649 1562193 Stevens, Baker and Jackson.
1562276 1564737 The thing that wasn't saved,<br />though, was the coins.
1564820 1566489 But then the army decides,<br />of course,
1566572 1568866 it ought to hold a hearing,<br />and Jackson's acquitted.
1568950 1571661 He disappears and<br />becomes Bill Carson.
1571744 1572870 I know his name.
1572954 1575998 But you don't know just who<br />you're looking for, and I do.
1576082 1579627 And when he's found,<br />I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.
1582630 1583673 Where is Carson?
1583756 1585383 All I know is Carson reenlisted.
1585466 1587009 The poor guy's minus an eye.
1587093 1589387 He lives with a girl<br />called Maria who'll tell you.
1589470 1591389 She's a fresh young<br />whore in the territory.
1591847 1592890 Where's she?
1592974 1594892 Now, what's the<br />name of that town?
1594976 1596477 Some place fairly near.
1599146 1600481 Santa Ana.
1603734 1606320 Adios, half-soldier.
1610491 1612535 Hey, Luke, hand me<br />down a whiskey.
1612618 1614662 "...and the sheriff's<br />office in Sonora."
1614745 1617790 "The condemned hired himself<br />out as a guide to a wagon train."
1617873 1621210 "After receiving his payment in<br />advance, he deserted the wagon train"
1621294 1623879 "on the hunting grounds<br />of the Sioux Indians."
1623963 1627675 Glad they got him,<br />a man guilty of all those crimes.
1627758 1629594 People with ropes around<br />their necks don't always hang.
1629677 1631262 What do you mean?
1631929 1633431 "The condemned<br />is also guilty..."
1633514 1636517 Even a filthy beggar like that<br />has got a protecting angel.
1642315 1643649 "...as a Mexican general."
1643733 1645693 A golden-haired angel<br />watches over him.
1647445 1648446 "For all these crimes,"
1648529 1651407 "the accused has made a full,<br />spontaneous confession."
1651490 1655036 "Therefore, we condemn him to<br />be hung by the neck until dead."
1655119 1657121 May the Lord have<br />mercy on his soul.
1657204 1658581 Proceed.
1673512 1675598 Let's get the hell out of here!
1707463 1709840 What are you trying to<br />say, anybody can miss a shot?
1709924 1711884 Nobody misses when<br />I'm at the end of the rope.
1711967 1713678 You've never had<br />a rope around your neck.
1713761 1715429 Well, I'm going to<br />tell you something.
1715513 1717306 When that rope<br />starts to pull tight,
1717390 1719558 you can feel<br />the devil bite your ass.
1722853 1726816 Yeah, you're right.<br />It's getting tougher.
1728401 1730152 The way I figure,
1730236 1732196 there's really<br />not too much future
1732279 1734490 with a sawed-off runt like you.
1734573 1735783 What do you mean?
1735866 1739328 'Cause I don't think you'll<br />ever be worth more than $3,000.
1740621 1741956 What do you mean?
1742957 1745292 I mean,<br />our partnership is untied.
1746836 1750005 Oh, no. Not you.<br />You remain tied.
1750798 1752967 I'll keep the money,<br />and you can have the rope.
1753884 1756345 You filthy,<br />double-crossing bastard!
1756429 1758013 Of all the stinking,<br />dirty tricks...
1758097 1760641 The way back to<br />town is only 70 miles.
1762393 1763436 You know,<br />if you save your breath,
1763519 1765271 I feel a man like<br />you could manage it.
1767273 1770401 You filthy bastard! Come here!
1770901 1773279 Come here! Cut this rope off!<br />Get off that horse.
1773362 1775740 Get off that horse,<br />you filthy coward!
1775823 1778659 If I ever catch you, Blondie,<br />I'll rip your heart out and eat it!
1778743 1780369 I'll scalp you!<br />I'll skin you alive!
1780453 1781746 I'll hang you up by your thumbs!
1781829 1783581 You pig! You vulture!
1783664 1786876 I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
1789170 1792715 Such ingratitude,<br />after all the times I've saved your life.
1798220 1801223 Where are you going? Wait a minute.<br />This is only a trick.
1801307 1802600 You wouldn't leave me here.
1802683 1805603 Come back! Wait! Blondie!
1805686 1807938 Listen, Blondie...
1832087 1834423 I believe madam is home.
1835716 1839970 Sweet dreams, and many thanks<br />from the Seventh Cavalry!
1848687 1850064 You filthy rats!
1866872 1867873 Maria.
1874588 1876757 Honey? Is that you, Bill?
1878425 1879426 Bill.
1889603 1892439 Who are you?<br />What do you want with me?
1893482 1895818 Go on talking about Bill Carson.
1896986 1898362 I don't know him.
1899947 1902116 You were calling<br />to him in the dark.
1906871 1907955 Where is he?
1908038 1909748 What are you going to do to him?
1911792 1913711 I'll ask the questions.
1915880 1917089 Where is he?
1924889 1927016 Where is he? Where?
1927099 1929977 Where? Where? Where?
1934815 1935983 That's enough!
1938068 1939486 I don't know where he is.
1939570 1941405 He packed his things<br />ten days ago
1941488 1944867 and went away with<br />his unit. They all left.
1944950 1946702 Which company? Where'd they go?
1951206 1953500 Third Cavalry, General Sibley.
1954668 1956587 They left for Santa Fe.
1957129 1959173 That's all I know, I swear!
2045843 2047428 But, but...
2052266 2054685 I'm very sorry,<br />but the store's closing.
2093140 2094391 Revolvers.
2094475 2095726 Yeah, revolvers.
2100481 2101648 Revolvers.
2102524 2105569 Well, here's where<br />I keep the best ones.
2110783 2113202 Here. Remington, Colt,
2114203 2119124 a Roat, Smith-Wesson,<br />Colt, Navy,
2120042 2123337 Joslyn, another Remington.
2123420 2125047 And this one is...<br />That's enough.
2168507 2169800 Cartridges.
2178767 2180769 You want to try the pistol?<br />Just step out back.
2180853 2182146 Let's go.
2187901 2189570 Move. Move.
2265062 2266438 Cartridge.
2274988 2276031 How much?
2276114 2277324 $20.
2280327 2281328 No.
2284831 2286333 $50.
2288085 2289503 How much?
2290212 2291588 $100
2294758 2297636 $200. It's all I've got.
2298845 2299930 Here.
2319616 2320659 Come here.
2351195 2353031 This morning,<br />I heard the whole thing.
2353114 2355242 They say Colonel Canby's<br />closing in with his Northerners,
2355325 2358202 and no later than tomorrow<br />that they'll be in the city.
2358286 2360371 That's why these<br />Southerners are getting out.
2361414 2365585 You see, as soon as these cowards<br />hear a Blue Shirt's around, they run.
2365668 2367170 These Rebels have<br />no will to fight.
2367253 2368588 Poor things.
2368671 2370256 They'll soon be finished.
2370340 2373968 We get rid of these bastards, then we<br />begin making money on those Yankees.
2374052 2376012 They carry gold,<br />not paper dollars,
2376095 2378056 and they're going<br />to beat the South.
2379474 2382644 Look. See that one with the<br />white beard sitting in the wagon?
2382727 2384562 General Sibley. He looks dead.
2384854 2386481 He's finally<br />getting out of our hair.
2386564 2391402 Hurray for Dixie!<br />Hurray! Hurray for Dixie!
2395448 2397659 Where's the owner of that horse?
2398493 2400036 Please, mister, sir,<br />a bad heart condition...
2400119 2401829 Where?
2401913 2404540 The war has<br />frightened me already.
2404624 2407001 I'm looking for the<br />owner of that horse.
2407085 2409170 He's tall, blond,<br />he smokes a cigar,
2409253 2411964 and he's a pig. Where is he now?
2412048 2414967 You leave him be.<br />He doesn't know who rides every horse.
2415051 2417178 You stay quiet, old hen.
2419055 2422392 Upstairs. Upstairs<br />in room four, se or.
2428147 2429607 Hear that?
2434946 2437448 You rotten criminals.<br />How dare you?
2632518 2633936 Your spurs.
2649410 2652079 There are two kinds<br />of spurs, my friend,
2652163 2654332 those that come in by the door,
2655166 2657710 those that come<br />in by the window.
2657793 2659503 Take off that pistol belt.
2667261 2668679 It's empty.
2671641 2672600 Mine isn't.
2679732 2683194 Even when Judas hanged himself,<br />there was a storm, too.
2686989 2689158 That could be cannon fire.
2689575 2692662 Cannon fire or storm,<br />it's all the same to you.
2695498 2697291 You ever see this<br />before, my friend?
2707468 2709136 Throw it over the roof beam.
2711889 2713015 That's it.
2724902 2726320 Now get on that.
2736789 2737790 That's right.
2738624 2740001 Now make sure the rope is tight.
2741252 2743796 It's got to hold<br />the weight of a pig.
2750594 2752138 Now put the rope<br />around your neck.
2759854 2761772 That's very good.
2762773 2764900 It's too big for your neck, huh?
2764984 2768154 We fix that right away.<br />I have another system,
2768779 2770906 a little different than yours.
2771866 2773701 I don't shoot the rope.
2773784 2775619 I shoot the legs off the stool.
2972316 2973817 Welcome, my friend.
2973901 2977571 If you're looking for a summer<br />vacation spot, you've found it.
2977655 2980491 Our hotel is luxurious<br />and filled with conveniences.
2983160 2985287 And the attractions<br />don't stop there.
2985371 2989541 International cuisine,<br />healthful and nutritious food.
2989625 2991585 Corn cobs, Dixie-style.
2991669 2994463 Our government has<br />spared no expense.
2994546 2997258 As you can see,<br />we are treated very well.
2997341 2998759 Have you ever heard of anyone
2998842 3000761 by the name of Bill Carson?
3000844 3006225 And you? Have you ever heard<br />of someone named Canby? No?
3006308 3008102 Well, you see,<br />he's a Yankee colonel
3008185 3010479 who decided to<br />tear us to pieces.
3010562 3013565 The only thing we care about<br />is saving our own hides.
3013649 3016026 And you ask me<br />if I know someone.
3017027 3019822 I just don't know what you<br />drifters could be thinking.
3031917 3035296 Carson has a patch over one eye.<br />He's with the Third.
3037715 3041844 If he's with the Third,<br />they've already left.
3041927 3043554 For Glorieta.
3043637 3045681 Canby's front line is<br />right on their heels.
3045764 3047808 Those poor young devils.
3047891 3050019 And the desert<br />lies ahead of them.
3050102 3052688 I really doubt that<br />any of them are still alive.
3054398 3056150 And what if they<br />were still alive?
3058944 3060112 Worse.
3061071 3064241 Well, then, you must not have<br />heard anything about Batterville.
3064825 3067161 It's one of those<br />Yankee prison camps
3067244 3069496 you'd better hope<br />you never end up in.
3070748 3072541 Keep it. It's yours.
3218145 3222107 "We have found the accused,<br />Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,"
3222191 3224818 "guilty of the following crimes,"
3224902 3228906 "horse theft, theft of supplies<br />belonging to the Union Army,"
3228989 3231867 "theft of supplies belonging<br />to the Confederate Army,"
3231950 3233827 "wounding two vigilantes,"
3233911 3236872 "assault and battery on<br />one named Barry O'Keefe,"
3236955 3240083 "perjury, blackmail, robbery,"
3240167 3241835 "escaping from a state prison,"
3241919 3244004 "disturbing the peace,<br />pandering, highway robbery..."
3244087 3245464 And Shorty?
3246340 3247841 "...forgery and murder."
3247925 3250719 Therefore, with the powers vested<br />in us by the laws of this state...
3250802 3251887 No.
3251970 3253013 No?
3253096 3255807 ...we have condemned the<br />aforementioned Thomas Larson,
3255891 3259520 alias Shorty Larson, to hang<br />by the neck until dead.
3259603 3262856 May God have mercy<br />on his soul. Proceed.
3269446 3271073 Sorry, Shorty.
3272699 3273867 Move. Come on, let's go.
3299810 3303021 I don't know. As soon as I hit the<br />desert, I'm thirsty.
3303105 3308151 Burns, huh? They say people with<br />fair skin can't take too much.
3332342 3334970 Like that,<br />you won't have to carry so much.
3337014 3338181 Where we going?
3339433 3342603 Where? Where I'm going, amigo.
3343854 3345272 Over that way.
3345355 3349735 Another 100 miles<br />of beautiful, sunbaked sand.
3349818 3352195 Even the armies are afraid<br />to march through there.
3352279 3354573 Sibley's men are<br />retreating up there.
3354656 3356742 Canby's men are coming here.
3357951 3360662 But no one will set<br />foot in this hell,
3362039 3364124 except you and me.
3365917 3368754 100 miles, that's a nice walk.
3371923 3374468 What was it you<br />told me the last time?
3376511 3380474 "If you save your breath,<br />I feel a man like you could manage it."
3382684 3386813 And if you won't manage it,<br />you'll die, only slowly,
3388315 3390734 very slowly, old friend.
3395864 3398575 After you, please.<br />Start walking.
3515275 3516735 Taking a rest?
3517861 3520405 Come on, Blondie.<br />We don't have very far to go.
3520489 3522282 Only 70 miles.
3523617 3526620 Only eight-and-a-half hours<br />more before sunset.
3527496 3529039 That's not too bad.
3530874 3532042 Come on.
3644404 3646072 Okay, let's eat.
3647073 3648992 That is, I'll eat.
3651119 3653663 Meanwhile, you can<br />enjoy a sunbath.
3663506 3664841 You want some water?
3669679 3671181 Drink. Drink.
3677270 3678563 Come on. Come on.
3720397 3723149 Well, Blondie. So long.
3790967 3792635 And so, Blondie,
3795221 3796639 it's goodbye.
3853530 3856699 Whoa, whoa, whoa,<br />whoa. Whoa, boy.
3860703 3862831 Easy, easy. Easy, easy.
3862914 3865041 Attaboy. That's nice.
4014023 4017193 Water. Water.
4023533 4025326 $200,000 in gold.
4025410 4027203 It's yours. Just get me water.
4032458 4033960 What's that you say?
4034836 4036129 Who the hell are you?
4036212 4037547 Carson.
4038673 4041301 My name is Bill Carson now.<br />It's Carson.
4041926 4043428 Surprise attack.
4045054 4049058 All dead. My name is<br />Jackson, not Carson.
4049142 4051477 Carson, Carson, yeah, yeah.<br />Glad to meet you, Carson.
4051561 4055315 I'm Lincoln's grandfather.<br />What was that you said about the dollars?
4055398 4057191 $200,000, all mine.
4058735 4060528 Was the Third Cavalry's.
4061821 4063823 Baker has nothing.
4064574 4068411 The gold, I hid the gold.<br />The gold is safe.
4069537 4073041 Where? Where, here? Here? Talk.
4073124 4075752 In the cemetery.
4076961 4078421 Which cemetery?
4078504 4081132 The one on Sad Hill.
4082425 4084594 There's a grave by...
4085053 4089140 Which grave? Have a name?<br />Have a number?
4089223 4091642 Come on, you dummy, talk.
4093269 4097106 There's no number.<br />There's a name.
4098524 4100360 It's written...
4100443 4101611 Yes?
4107492 4108951 Water.
4111371 4114332 You talk first, huh?<br />I'll give you water later.
4114415 4116042 Sad Hill Cemetery. Okay.
4116125 4117377 In the grave. Okay.
4117460 4119921 But it must have a name<br />or a number on it, huh?
4120004 4122507 There must be a<br />thousand, five thousand.
4127136 4128971 Don't die, huh?
4129055 4130973 Don't die. I'll get you water.
4131516 4134894 Stay there. Don't move.<br />I'll get you water.
4134977 4137605 Don't die until later,<br />you son of a...
4163005 4164632 Get away from there.
4170805 4172140 He's dead.
4172223 4173266 Yeah.
4175935 4177645 I'll kill you.
4180481 4183526 If you do that,<br />you'll always be poor,
4184694 4187321 just like the greasy<br />rat that you are.
4188239 4192577 If I were you,<br />I'd keep me alive.
4192660 4195913 What did he tell you, huh?
4195997 4197165 A name.
4198499 4199876 A name on a grave.
4200626 4202044 What name?
4215975 4218102 Blondie, don't die.
4218186 4221606 Blondie, don't die.<br />I'm your friend.
4221689 4222940 Please don't die. Please.
4223024 4225193 I'm your friend.<br />Come on. Come on.
4227278 4228821 Blondie.
4228905 4230740 I'll help you. I'll help you.
4230823 4232575 Don't move. I'll be right back.
4232658 4235912 Here's the water.<br />Don't die like that pig.
4235995 4239957 Hey, Blondie, here's water.<br />Water, Blondie.
4240041 4241918 Don't drink, don't drink.<br />Is no good for you.
4242001 4243794 Feel better?
4243878 4245838 Blondie, what's the matter?
4245922 4247590 Please, don't die.
4256516 4259393 Hey, open up! Open up! Hurry!
4260061 4262438 Settle down. Settle down.<br />Who's there?
4264315 4267610 What do you mean,<br />"Who's there?" You think I'm the enemy?
4271072 4275034 If ll were a Yankee,<br />you wouldn't have time to ask me that.
4275117 4276118 Come on.
4276285 4279205 Sergeant, listen to<br />this corporal for a moment.
4279372 4280373 Yes, sir.
4280456 4283000 Sergeant,<br />I have a gravely wounded man here,
4283084 4284877 if he's not dead already.
4287046 4288214 He's still alive?
4288297 4289882 Well, he seems to be.
4291676 4293302 What happened? It was a trap.
4293386 4295054 Only the two of us got away.
4295137 4296847 Name and traveling papers.
4299392 4303396 Here. Corporal Bill Carson.<br />Third Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,
4303479 4306148 arriving from San Rafael.<br />Is that enough?
4311904 4314115 Are you reading<br />when this man is dying?
4314657 4316409 Why, Corporal,<br />we're trying to withdraw
4316492 4318494 and you're looking<br />for an infirmary?
4318578 4321622 If you want one, you'll have to<br />make yourself a Yankee prisoner.
4323124 4324584 So where are we?
4324667 4326210 Near Apache Canyon.
4328004 4329171 Apache Canyon?
4329255 4330381 Apache Canyon.
4330464 4332883 Is a Mission San Antonio<br />around here?
4332967 4335303 Sure, 18 miles south.<br />Take him there.
4335386 4337180 The brothers take care<br />of anyone who's wounded,
4337263 4339181 no matter what<br />the color of his uniform.
4339265 4341934 And keep your eyes open,<br />the area is full of Yankees.
4342018 4343769 Thank you. Goodbye, Sergeant.
4343853 4345104 Take care.
4369879 4371130 I've got a very sick man here.
4371213 4372757 But we have no more beds here.
4372840 4374175 Let him have yours.
4380473 4381557 Where's Pablo Ramirez?
4381641 4382683 Father Ramirez.
4382767 4387146 He's away at the moment.<br />He should be back any day now.
4387229 4388606 Well, it doesn't matter.
4388689 4391567 For the moment,<br />we take very good care of my friend.
4391651 4393402 And may God be praised.
4393486 4395863 In case you didn't know it,<br />God is on our side, too,
4395946 4399116 because he hates<br />the Yanks, huh, Blondie?
4399200 4401661 Blondie? Father,<br />is he still breathing?
4401744 4403954 Yes, of course.
4404038 4405748 You're heavy.
4417259 4418386 There.
4448332 4450793 All right,<br />put a fresh bandage on him.
4452169 4453921 Put him in my cell.
4454964 4456006 Easy.
4459468 4461721 Out, soldier.<br />Out you go. Come on.
4461804 4464765 Look out for him, please.<br />He's like a brother to me.
4470312 4472148 Hey, Father, I...
4484994 4487663 Father, did he speak?<br />Did he say anything?
4518277 4520571 Father, did he ask for me?<br />Did he speak about anything, Father?
4520654 4522156 Oh, no, he hasn't spoken as yet.
4522239 4523699 But you mustn't worry.
4523783 4525409 He's both young and strong.
4525493 4527787 That's what's kept<br />him going until now.
4527870 4530289 He should regain his strength<br />in a very short time.
4530372 4531374 Thank you, Father. Thank you.
4531457 4532959 You don't know how much<br />this boy's life means to me.
4533042 4535169 Thanks be to Jesus.<br />Thanks to all of you.
4584677 4585678 Blondie.
4591684 4593394 Hey, Blondie.
4613581 4617293 The old father tells me you'll<br />be up and around in a few days.
4617376 4621171 You're very lucky to have me<br />so close when it happened.
4621255 4623132 Think if you'd been on your own.
4624967 4627553 Look, I mean, when...
4627636 4630306 When one is ill,
4630389 4635019 it's good to have somebody close<br />by, friends or relations.
4635853 4641025 Do you have parents,<br />Blondie? A mother?
4641817 4643319 Not even a mother.
4644820 4645863 No one?
4646989 4649825 You're all alone, huh?<br />Like me, Blondie.
4650492 4652244 We're all alone in the world.
4653537 4655623 I have you, you have me.
4658334 4660044 Only for a little while, I mean.
4660836 4662838 It had to happen now.
4663589 4666050 What a dirty,<br />rotten trick of fate.
4666133 4668636 We could have all that<br />money in our hands.
4675726 4678187 I must tell you<br />the truth, Blondie.
4678270 4680689 In my place, you would<br />do the same thing.
4682983 4684860 It's all over for you now.
4685861 4688280 There's nothing<br />anyone can do anymore.
4691158 4693452 God help me. It's my fault.
4693535 4695704 Mine, mine, mine, mine.
4706966 4709301 I'll tell you<br />one thing, Blondie.
4709718 4713263 If I knew that<br />my last hour had come, I swear
4713347 4716600 in my place, in your place,<br />I would do the same thing.
4717518 4720896 I would tell about the gold.<br />Yes. Yes, I would.
4720980 4723440 I'd tell the name on the grave.
4723524 4726151 After all, what good is the<br />money to you if you're dead?
4726235 4728112 I know the name of the cemetery,
4728195 4730739 but you know how many<br />graves there are there?
4731532 4734868 Please, Blondie.
4734952 4741125 Please, have a little, huh?<br />Here. Coffee.
4741208 4743043 Please, tell me the name
4743919 4746380 on the grave.
4747631 4750759 If I get my hands<br />on the $200,000,
4752386 4754471 I'll always honor your memory.
4755431 4758642 I swear, I'll always<br />honor your memory.
4761687 4763313 Come closer.
4768694 4770279 Tell me.
4771655 4773282 Why, you dirty...
4775325 4777870 I'll sleep better
4778954 4782958 knowing my good<br />friend is by my side
4783959 4785961 to protect me.
4794636 4796722 "Tuco, water."<br />Well, here's water.
4796805 4800059 But if I get that name from<br />you, I'll give you water.
4807608 4810402 All right, you dirty skunk,<br />get your ass off the bed.
4810486 4812529 Come on, come on,<br />the party's over.
4812613 4814573 The wagon is all ready to go.
4814656 4816534 From the way the wounded<br />are pouring into this place,
4816617 4817743 we better get<br />the hell out of here
4817826 4819912 before we get<br />caught up in the war.
4819995 4821122 Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
4821205 4822331 Yeah.
4823165 4824417 This is something<br />I have to look into.
4824500 4826335 It'll only take<br />a minute. Get moving.
4827836 4829254 Where, this way? Yes.
4846897 4848065 Hey, Pablo.
4856698 4858617 Don't you recognize me?
4860369 4863872 It's me, Tuco.<br />Let me embrace you.
4867960 4870379 I don't know the right thing.
4875259 4877553 I was just passing by here,<br />I said to myself,
4877636 4879763 "I wonder if my brother<br />remembers his brother."
4883892 4884893 Did I do wrong?
4887104 4889314 It doesn't matter.<br />I'm very happy.
4889606 4891233 You have seen me, Tuco.
4893861 4896488 Yeah, well,<br />I'm very glad I came.
4902244 4906540 Oh, my uniform.<br />It's a long story.
4906623 4910043 But let's talk about you.<br />It's more important.
4910127 4912421 You look very well.
4912504 4914423 A bit thin, perhaps, but
4916425 4918844 you were always thin,<br />eh, Pablito?
4922347 4923765 What about our parents?
4925809 4928228 Only now do you think of them.
4929104 4931523 To begin after nine years.
4933275 4934693 Nine years?
4936528 4940282 So it's nine years. Nine years.
4941533 4944119 Our mother has been dead<br />along time now.
4945787 4947831 Our father died<br />only a few days ago.
4949124 4950959 That's why I was away.
4952961 4956506 He asked for you to be there,<br />but there was only me.
4964514 4965641 And you?
4966642 4969311 Outside of evil,<br />what else have you managed to do?
4971146 4973482 It seems to me you once<br />had a wife some place.
4977152 4979112 Not one, lots of them.
4979196 4981490 One here, one there,<br />wherever I found them.
4983116 4985535 Go on, preach me<br />a sermon, Pablo.
4987663 4989581 What good would that be?
4991166 4993585 Just keep on<br />the way you're going.
4993669 4995254 Go away.
4996588 4997715 And the Lord have<br />mercy on your soul.
4997798 4998799 Sure, I'll go, I'll go.
4998882 5001677 While I'm waiting for<br />the Lord to remember me,
5001760 5004972 I, Tuco Ramirez,<br />brother of Brother Ramirez,
5005055 5007349 will tell you something.
5007432 5009559 You think you're<br />better than I am.
5009643 5012271 Where we came from,<br />if one didn't want to die of poverty,
5012354 5014773 one became a priest or a bandit.
5014856 5017401 You chose your way,<br />I chose mine.
5017484 5019194 Mine was harder!
5019278 5020946 You talk about<br />Mother and Father.
5021029 5024616 You remember, when you left to<br />become a priest, I stayed behind.
5024700 5028537 I must have been 10, 12.<br />I don't remember which, but I stayed.
5028620 5031039 I tried, but it was no good.
5031123 5033166 Now I will tell you something.
5033250 5036920 You became a priest because you were<br />too much of a coward to do what I do.
5056148 5057357 Tuco.
5068493 5070454 Please forgive me, brother.
5099566 5101693 My belly's full.
5103653 5105405 Nice guy, my brother.
5106239 5108575 I didn't tell you my<br />brother was in charge here?
5108658 5110786 Everything.<br />Like the pope almost.
5110869 5114414 He's in charge in Rome.<br />Yeah, yeah, my brother, he say to me,
5114498 5116375 "Stay, brother. Don't go home."
5116458 5118210 "We never see each other."
5118293 5122798 "Here there's plenty to eat and drink.<br />Bring your friend, too."
5122881 5125133 Whenever we see each other,<br />he never lets me go.
5125217 5127844 It's always the same story.
5127928 5130639 My brother,<br />he is crazy about me.
5134267 5138480 That's so. Even a tramp like<br />me, no matter what happens,
5139523 5142317 I know there's a brother<br />somewhere who will never refuse me
5142401 5143944 a bowl of soup.
5146154 5147239 Sure.
5149032 5152577 Well, after a meal,<br />there's nothing like a good cigar.
5203503 5205755 Here's the Sierra Magdalena.
5206548 5209092 Going this way,<br />we cross the Rio Grande.
5209968 5211887 That sure is a long way.
5213180 5216600 Here to the northwest,<br />through all of Texas.
5217476 5219394 After that... Then what?
5221563 5222939 When we get there,<br />I'll tell you.
5223023 5224566 You're not worried, are you?
5228403 5231698 Those men aren't worried about<br />anything anymore, are they?
5234659 5236495 But since I'm alive<br />and I've noticed
5236578 5240081 we'll be crossing Yankee and<br />Confederate lines a few times,
5240957 5243335 I thought you might<br />tell me where we're going.
5244211 5245962 Towards $200,000.
5246046 5247756 Is that good enough for you?
5267234 5269569 Hey, wake up, you.
5269653 5270946 The troops are coming. Come on.
5271029 5272447 Blue or gray?
5279746 5283375 They're gray like us. Let's say<br />"hello" to them and then get going.
5283458 5287337 Hoorah! Hoorah for<br />the Confederacy!
5287420 5290715 Hoorah! Down with General Grant!
5290799 5293885 Hoorah for General...<br />What's his name? Lee.
5293969 5295637 Lee! Lee!
5296638 5299849 God is with us because<br />he hates the Yanks, too!
5301851 5305355 God's not on our side<br />'cause he hates idiots also.
5317450 5321496 Hut, two, three, four.<br />Hut, two, three, four.
5321580 5325500 Hut, two, three, four.<br />Hut, two, three, four.
5325584 5328169 Prisoners of war, forward
5329838 5331464 march!
5383516 5384934 Halt!
5388188 5390523 Left face!
5393777 5396780 Form a single file. Move!
5439114 5440407 Jonathan Frost!
5440490 5441783 Present!
5448581 5450041 Richard McGilley!
5450125 5451501 Present!
5451584 5453002 Nathaniel Sullivan!
5453086 5454462 Present.
5455797 5457257 Robert Clark!
5457507 5458758 Present.
5459551 5460635 Sam Richmond!
5460719 5461761 Present.
5465348 5466474 Bill Carson!
5470311 5471938 Bill Carson!
5473148 5475400 I said Bill Carson!
5475483 5478361 Hey, Blondie,<br />isn't that Angel Eyes?
5479446 5481990 All right,<br />what's he doing, sleeping?
5483324 5484659 Bill Carson!
5485493 5488621 Yeah, and you<br />better be Bill Carson.
5488705 5490165 Bill Carson!
5490582 5492834 Yeah, that's me.
5501509 5503261 Please, Carson,
5504763 5506556 answer "present."
5508224 5510185 What are you, deaf?
5516024 5518193 Now suppose you<br />say "present," Carson.
5520361 5523531 I like big fat men like you.
5523615 5525450 When they fall,<br />they make more noise,
5525533 5527702 and sometimes they never get up.
5529370 5530830 Wallace,
5532665 5533875 that's enough.
5537086 5538213 Sergeant!
5540381 5542467 The captain wants<br />to see you right away.
5546471 5548264 Be sure these two<br />get good treatment.
5559192 5560944 Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?
5561027 5562570 Good treatment.
5565365 5566449 Yeah.
5570036 5571538 For the last time, Sergeant,
5572413 5576626 I'm telling you,<br />I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.
5577418 5578878 No more brutality.
5580255 5581715 There's hundreds of<br />prisoners out there
5581798 5583967 and only a few<br />men to guard them.
5584050 5586177 Now what am I supposed to do?<br />I have to have respect.
5586511 5589722 I think that you'll manage<br />to gain their respect
5589806 5592100 by treating them better.
5592725 5595353 Are our men treated that well<br />in Andersonville camp?
5595436 5598231 I don't give a God damn<br />what they do in Andersonville.
5598314 5601651 While I'm in charge here,<br />the prisoners are not to be tortured,
5601734 5604779 or cheated or murdered.
5605655 5607073 That an accusation?
5607615 5612453 Sergeant, gangrene is eating<br />my leg away, not my eyes.
5613454 5616666 I know the prisoners here are<br />being robbed systematically.
5616749 5620044 I know there's scum around who<br />are bivouacked near the camp
5620128 5622714 waiting for someone<br />to deliver this loot.
5623423 5628094 But as long as I'm commandant, I won't<br />permit any such trickery. Am I clear?
5630638 5632181 Yes.
5632265 5634017 Just as long as<br />you're the commandant.
5636352 5637770 Yes, Sergeant.
5640690 5644068 I know this leg means<br />I won't last very long,
5644152 5648698 but I pray I can manage to have<br />enough time to amass evidence
5648781 5650992 and bring to a court-martial
5651075 5656414 all those who discredit and<br />dishonor the uniform of the Union.
5661628 5663546 I wish you luck.
5698164 5701292 You and the others better<br />lay low for a few days.
5702293 5703962 No, I'll keep this. You go.
5704045 5705713 Wallace will let you know.
5716599 5719018 Wallace, bring me Carson.
5719102 5720603 Right.
5734450 5738371 Listen, Angel Eyes said for<br />us to lay low for a few days,
5738454 5741874 but we'll keep close enough<br />to keep an eye on things.
5741958 5743501 Come on, saddle your horses.
5744377 5745670 Get in.
5754679 5757765 Come on in, Tuco.<br />Don't be bashful.
5759058 5761102 There's no formalities here.
5772530 5773990 It's been a long time.
5778244 5781289 You're hungry. Sit down, eat.
5801100 5802810 I knew it, I knew it.
5805229 5807315 The minute I saw you,<br />I said to myself,
5808566 5810985 "Look at that pig, Angel Eyes."
5812320 5814238 "I'll bet he got<br />himself an easy job,"
5818159 5819994 "and he never forgets a friend."
5821162 5823081 I never forget<br />old friends, Tuco.
5825792 5827043 Right.
5827126 5828669 It's good to see<br />old friends again.
5830671 5832256 Good.
5832340 5834801 Especially when they've<br />come from so far away
5835843 5837720 and have so much to talk about.
5839639 5842517 And you do have a lot to talk<br />about, haven't you?
5845019 5848147 You were captured<br />near Fort Craig.
5853027 5854696 Well, if you were<br />with Sibley, that means then
5854779 5857406 that you were coming<br />from Santa Fe.
5871003 5873089 Was it hard crossing the desert?
5873172 5874924 Mmm-Hmm. Very hard.
5876551 5879011 Especially if you don't<br />have anything to drink.
5881764 5884350 Why are you going under the<br />name of Bill Carson now?
5890565 5893192 One name is as good as another.
5893276 5895027 Not wise to use your own name.
5896279 5897488 Like you.
5897572 5899532 I'll bet they don't<br />call you Angel Eyes.
5900783 5902577 Sergeant Angel Eyes.
5911669 5914797 Like a little music<br />with your meal, Tuco?
5914881 5919010 Music? Yes, it's very good,<br />very good for the digestion.
5932648 5933816 So...
5934984 5937445 Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
5943075 5944327 That fake, too?
5946454 5948789 Bill Carson's name's<br />written in it.
5950583 5954337 Have some.<br />It's Bill Carson's tobacco.
6006865 6008450 More feeling.
6050246 6052081 Was Carson dead or alive<br />when you found him?
6059422 6061298 What'd he tell you<br />about the money?
6064075 6066144 I...
6066327 6068954 I don't know what<br />you're talking about.
6091999 6093959 How's your digestion now?
6098789 6100540 You'd better talk.
6100624 6102876 I have nothing to tell you.
6141533 6143117 Play that fiddle, you.
6167393 6170980 You can sure consider yourself<br />much luckier than your pal.
6171064 6173983 Wallace will punch your friend<br />as long as the song goes.
6174067 6176444 So many of us have<br />had a session in there.
6210695 6212781 What did he say about the money?
6216826 6219245 It's buried in a grave.
6220622 6222081 Where?
6222165 6223583 Sad Hill.
6223666 6226085 Sad Hill Cemetery.
6228963 6230381 Which grave?
6231382 6235053 I don't know.<br />I don't know, I tell you.
6236513 6240642 Blondie. Ask Blondie.
6240725 6243269 He knows the name on the grave.
6265416 6267085 Put those clothes on.
6271506 6273132 Why?
6273216 6274676 We're going for a ride.
6276261 6277387 Where?
6277470 6279138 To find $200,000.
6280765 6283601 I know the name of<br />the cemetery now,
6283685 6286104 and you know<br />the name of the grave.
6306249 6309210 You're not gonna give me<br />the same treatment?
6313047 6314132 Would you talk?
6315758 6317135 No, probably not.
6319304 6320805 That's what I thought.
6321848 6323975 Not that you're any<br />tougher than Tuco,
6324058 6327061 but you're smart enough to know<br />that talking won't save you.
6331149 6334193 And Tuco, is he...
6336487 6338448 No. Not yet.
6339824 6341743 But he's in very good hands.
6343369 6346539 You've changed partners,<br />but you still got the same deal.
6346623 6349208 I'm not greedy.<br />I'm only taking half.
6350543 6352253 There's two of us.
6352337 6354005 It should make it<br />easier than just one.
6359344 6360595 Yeah.
6380698 6384243 Hold it. That's it, don't move.
6385161 6388748 Now don't breathe.<br />Still. That's it.
6390792 6392669 Got it. Thank you.
6408685 6410603 Hey, Corporal,<br />afraid he'll get lost?
6410687 6412355 Where's the rebel going?
6412438 6416025 To hell, with a rope around his<br />neck and a price on his head.
6416109 6417944 $3,000, friend.
6418027 6419821 That's a lot of<br />money for a head.
6421406 6424075 I'll bet they didn't even<br />pay you a penny for your arm.
6430581 6434043 I told you once, friend,<br />If ll ever get you down,
6434127 6437171 you're gonna need a lot of<br />help to get up again. A lot.
6456941 6459152 You're a lot luckier<br />than that one there.
6459235 6461779 You get some trouble, rope,<br />and you're all finished.
6461863 6464615 And there isn't any partner<br />this time to shoot you down.
6567009 6569512 If your friends<br />stay out in the damp,
6569595 6572056 they're liable to<br />catch a cold, aren't they?
6572140 6573641 Or a bullet.
6578563 6580690 Hear that, boys?<br />Come on out here.
6593327 6594829 Since we're all going<br />in the same direction,
6594912 6596581 might as well go together.
6597957 6603171 One, two, three, four,
6603254 6605423 five, six.
6606132 6608718 Six. Perfect number.
6610595 6612388 Isn't three the perfect number?
6614599 6617351 <i>Yeah. Bull got six<br />more bullets in my gun.</i>
6681499 6684210 Sure would like to<br />put your paw on it, huh?
6686337 6688422 I would like to piss.<br />It's rough.
6688506 6690758 I've been shaken up on this<br />train nearly ten hours now.
6691133 6693928 You smell like a pig already,
6694011 6696389 but let's not try<br />to make things any worse.
6698849 6700476 Get going.
6709527 6711862 I can't while<br />you're watching me.
6735636 6737722 You made a lot of noise,<br />my friend, huh?
6759285 6762747 You don't want to break our<br />friendship, huh? Well, I'll break it.
6867518 6869145 Halt.
6870563 6872189 Take your places.
6883576 6884994 Ready!
6885536 6887663 Aim! Fire!
6905055 6907224 Slim, take care of the horses.
7163772 7166275 I've been looking for<br />you for eight months.
7167401 7169281 Whenever I should've<br />had a gun in my right hand,
7170487 7171989 I thought of you.
7172072 7175993 Now I find you in exactly<br />the position that suits me.
7176076 7179788 I had lots of time to learn<br />how to shoot with my left.
7195846 7197973 When you have to shoot,<br />shoot. Don't talk.
7202019 7204605 Every gun makes its own tune.
7205647 7207608 It's perfect timing, Large One.
7225918 7228170 Clem, follow him.
7285060 7288063 Just a minute.<br />I'll be right there.
7288146 7291358 Just give me a little time to get<br />dressed, and I'll open up.
7312337 7314590 Put your drawers on<br />and take your gun off.
7326268 7328103 Hey, Blondie,
7328186 7330439 how the hell did you<br />get out of that pigsty?
7332316 7336153 My own way. I'm here with your old<br />friend, Angel Eyes.
7337195 7340282 You talked, you traitor.<br />You talked.
7341158 7342659 No, I didn't talk.
7343327 7345579 If I did, I probably<br />wouldn't be here now.
7347164 7349291 You, me...
7350208 7352544 So only you know<br />your half of the secret?
7358216 7359760 Blondie,
7359843 7364222 I'm very happy you're working with<br />me, and we're together again.
7364306 7366558 I get dressed,<br />I kill him and be right back.
7366642 7369519 Oh, listen, I forgot to mention,
7372147 7374733 he's not alone.<br />There's five of them.
7377194 7378195 Five?
7378278 7379529 Yeah, five of them.
7382866 7385327 So that's why you came to Tuco?
7388538 7390874 It doesn't matter.<br />I'll kill them all.
7402928 7404805 They shot him at close range.
7424616 7426785 Well, look who's here.
7426868 7428996 The other one will be along.
7431581 7433250 They'll come looking for us.
7435168 7436586 Watch out.
7437713 7439297 There's two of them.
7440716 7442676 I want that blond alive.
7451601 7455063 You, back there.<br />Come on, let's go.
7489139 7491016 Were you gonna die alone?
7602169 7603253 Halt!
7628236 7629529 Hey, Blondie,
7629613 7631406 Angel Eyes is mine, huh?
7631489 7632616 All right.
7672364 7674407 "See you soon..."
7677160 7678578 "Idiots."
7679788 7680997 It's for you.
7706189 7709192 How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
7709276 7711569 Like a cemetery, for instance?
7713071 7715240 There should be<br />a bridge across that river.
7716116 7717575 We'd better wait for nightfall.
7717659 7719202 Trust in me, Blondie.
7722831 7724582 I got a good sense<br />of where I'm going.
7724666 7726126 Tuco has taken you this far.
7726209 7728044 I will take you all the way...
7728586 7730171 Gentlemen.
7733675 7735510 Tell the captain. Yes, sir.
7736803 7738722 Come along now. Follow me.
7785935 7787979 We found them<br />near the perimeter, sir.
7802994 7804913 Where do you hail from?
7805246 7806247 Illinois.
7809167 7810919 And you?
7811002 7812754 I'm with him.
7819094 7821471 Any reason for<br />being around here?
7822347 7824724 We want to enlist, General.
7827769 7830146 You better learn<br />to distinguish rank.
7830230 7832023 I'm a captain.
7833691 7834776 Get the hell out.
7836903 7839989 It sure as hell might be you<br />today, So go write your will.
7840073 7841408 Yes, sir.
7846496 7848164 So you want to enlist?
7849624 7851876 You gotta take<br />a test to prove it.
7861344 7862595 Well, show me.
7886786 7888163 You've got a career.
7888246 7891124 At the least, I'd say<br />you'll make colonel.
7891207 7892876 Really? Sure.
7893960 7897797 Like it says in the manual,<br />"You've got every qualification,"
7897881 7900467 "to become an expert<br />in the use of weapons."
7901759 7905930 For this, sir, is<br />the most potent weapon in war.
7908766 7911227 The fighting spirit's<br />in this bottle.
7913271 7914772 Volunteers.
7916983 7918776 You want to enlist?
7920320 7923364 Let's go. Come on,<br />gentlemen. Come on.
7926409 7929078 The shooting hasn't begun yet.<br />We still have time.
7945386 7947680 Whoever has the most liquor<br />to get the soldiers drunk
7947764 7951267 and send them to be<br />slaughtered, is the winner.
7952185 7957148 We and the ones over on the other side of<br />the river only have one thing in common.
7958900 7960568 All of us reek of alcohol.
7969077 7970870 What did you say your name was?
7973915 7975166 And you?
7978503 7979504 No.
7985218 7986886 Names don't matter.
7987720 7989055 Yes, because SOON you can join
7989138 7991307 the gallant heroes<br />of Branson Bridge.
7993685 7995520 We have two attacks a day.
7995603 7997397 Two attacks a day?
7997480 8000984 Sure, the Rebs have<br />decided that damn bridge
8001067 8002860 is the key to this whole area.
8003903 8006781 Stupid, useless bridge.
8006864 8009742 Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
8011494 8016249 And headquarters has declared we<br />must take that ridiculous flyspeck
8018001 8020086 even if all of us are killed.
8020169 8022255 Otherwise,<br />the key will get rusty
8022338 8024465 and just be a spot on the wall.
8025967 8027844 And that's not all.
8027927 8030513 Both sides want<br />the bridge intact.
8030597 8035018 Intact is how the South wants<br />it, and we want it intact, too.
8037770 8039814 You'll all turn to dust,
8039897 8045028 but one thing is sure, boys,<br />Branson Bridge will stand unbroken.
8046529 8050617 Is it bad to speak the<br />way I do to volunteers?
8051868 8053286 I've done a lot worse.
8058374 8061669 I've done it.<br />I've blown it up. Boom.
8063004 8065923 In here, I've destroyed it all.
8067175 8069093 It's a court-martial<br />offense to imagine,
8069177 8072555 to dream of blowing it up.<br />A serious crime.
8072639 8076726 Even to think of destroying<br />that bridge is just...
8079646 8081731 Why not really<br />blow it up, Captain?
8083483 8086402 Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.<br />Let's scare the hell out of them.
8090323 8092408 I've been dreaming about it.
8096120 8098081 I've even worked out a plan.
8099791 8101167 I sure have.
8102502 8105463 The best time is<br />after the attack
8105546 8108466 when there's a truce<br />to get the wounded.
8109592 8114222 If I could do it,<br />I could save many thousands of men.
8119894 8122063 But what I lack is the guts.
8128027 8131197 They're beginning their daily<br />slaughter right on time.
8131280 8134826 Captain, all companies<br />are awaiting your orders.
8134909 8136285 Be right there.
8149924 8151217 Let's go.
8152301 8156139 All right, friends,<br />come along and enjoy the spectacle.
8187795 8190423 Companies, report!
8190506 8193426 Company B ready!
8193509 8196095 Company E ready!
8196179 8198222 Company D ready!
8204061 8207231 Companies, forward!
8228628 8229796 Hey, Blondie,
8229879 8232757 it looks like the captain is really<br />asking for a bullet in his guts.
8232840 8233966 Yeah.
8287436 8290398 I've never seen SO many<br />men wasted so badly.
8311127 8314714 I have a feeling it's really<br />gonna be a good, long battle.
8318885 8320595 Blondie?
8321220 8323472 The money's on the<br />other side of the river.
8325266 8326475 Where?
8329103 8332231 Amigo, I said the other side,<br />and that's enough.
8333149 8336152 But while the Confederates are<br />there, we can't get across.
8337820 8341490 What would happen if somebody<br />were to blow up that bridge?
8343200 8344327 Yeah.
8345411 8348164 Then these idiots would go<br />somewhere else to fight.
8349040 8350249 Maybe.
8388287 8390873 Doctor, quick,<br />the captain's wounded.
8393584 8395378 Hurry, a stretcher.
8397755 8399340 Easy. Easy now.
8410309 8411978 Get things ready.
8432915 8434125 A little of this will help.
8441340 8443175 Take a slug of this, Captain.
8443968 8445761 Keep your ears open.
8494643 8497313 What are you doing?<br />No, leave me alone.
8596787 8600583 Blondie, you realize<br />we might be risking our lives.
8601458 8603711 Yeah, and if I get killed,
8603794 8607173 you'll never get your hands<br />on all that beautiful money.
8607256 8608757 Yeah, Tuco,
8610009 8611552 it sure would be a pity.
8642458 8643542 Doc.
8645669 8646962 Doctor,
8647796 8649924 could you help me<br />live a little more?
8650674 8652468 I expect good news.
8703477 8706772 Why don't we tell each other<br />our half of the secret?
8706855 8708190 Why don't we?
8710317 8711735 You go first.
8714029 8716031 No, I think it's better that
8718993 8720327 you start.
8724623 8725958 All right.
8728377 8730421 The name of the cemetery is...
8748605 8750357 Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.
8759074 8760743 The name on the grave is
8765497 8766999 Arch Stanton.
8769126 8772004 Arch Stanton? Are you sure?
8773339 8775132 Yeah, sure, I'm sure.
9483798 9486134 It'll be a lot easier with that.
9526466 9529302 Two can dig a lot<br />quicker than one.
9529385 9530512 Dig.
9533515 9534891 You're not digging.
9547403 9550532 If you shoot me,<br />you won't see a cent of that money.
9552700 9553743 Why?
9556955 9558665 I'll tell you why.
9559749 9561543 "Cause there's nothing in there."
9570218 9571636 Why, you son of a...
9571719 9573263 You thought I'd trust you?
9576891 9578768 $200,000 is a lot of money.
9580895 9582689 We're gonna have to earn it.
9586317 9587402 How?
9598955 9601207 I'll write the name<br />on the bottom of this stone.
9605628 9606921 The gun.
9973538 9977124 You pig. You want to get me killed?<br />When'd you unload it?
9979418 9980795 Last night.
9981963 9986634 You see, in this world,<br />there's two kinds of people, my friend,
9986717 9990721 those with loaded guns,<br />and those who dig.
9991389 9992515 You dig.
9993182 9994308 Where?
10005319 10006445 Here.
10010825 10012326 There's no name on it!
10013953 10015830 There's no name here either.
10017748 10020585 You see, that's what<br />Bill Carson told me.
10020668 10024672 It was the grave marked "Unknown"<br />right beside Arch Stanton.
10032388 10034015 Go ahead.
10091822 10094408 Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie.
10111300 10112468 You're joking, Blondie.
10112551 10115262 You wouldn't play<br />a joke on me like that.
10116639 10118974 It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.
10119850 10121143 Now I want you to stand up there
10121227 10122812 and put your head in that noose.
10190379 10194508 Well, now, seems<br />just like old times.
10198846 10200806 Four for you
10202433 10204018 and four...
10207271 10208689 Four for me.
10240654 10241655 Blondie...
10251081 10254001 Blondie!
10273228 10274229 Blondie.
10302091 10304927 Blondie!
10331161 10332496 Blondie!
10392723 10394683 Hey, Blondie!
10396627 10399505 You know what you are?
10402333 10405420 Just a dirty son of a bitch!
