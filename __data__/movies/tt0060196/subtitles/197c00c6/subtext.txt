235333 237836 (door bangs in the wind)
335225 337310 (gunfire)
634148 637318 You're from Baker?
647870 650581 Tell Baker I told him all I know already.
650665 654794 Tell him I want to live in peace,<br />that it's no use to go on tormenting me.
654877 657797 I know nothing about that case of coins.
657880 663260 Now that gold has disappeared, but if<br />he'd listened we could have avoided this.
663344 666972 I went to the army court.<br />There were no witnesses.
667056 669308 They couldn't uncover any more.
669392 672269 I can't tell Baker<br />what happened to the money.
672353 675815 Go back and tell him that.
676899 680611 Word's around you had a visitor.
680695 683322 And Baker knows it.
684740 687243 Name of Jackson.
689912 691455 Well?
691539 693999 Jackson was here.
695459 698587 Or Baker's got it all wrong.
705386 707722 He's not wrong.
707805 712560 Maybe Baker would like to know<br />just what you and Jackson had to say...
712643 715771 about the cash box.
718524 721694 That's not what I'm being paid for.
725239 729827 I'm only interested in what name<br />Jackson's hiding under now.
732329 735166 Why do you think<br />Jackson is assuming another name?
735249 738210 I would have found him already.
738294 741672 When I start off<br />to find somebody, I find 'em.
741755 744842 That's why they pay me.
749305 751515 What is Baker paying you?
754810 757938 That your family?
766113 767656 Yes.
768157 771243 Nice family.
772536 775539 What does he pay you for murdering me?
778042 782296 500 dollars, to get the name.
788552 790638 The name.
799563 802274 Carson... Bill Carson.
803150 805903 That's what he calls himself now.
835891 838811 It's a lot of money. One thousand.
842773 845275 A thousand dollars?
847111 851281 And some in gold. It's a tidy sum.
854743 857287 But when I'm paid...
857371 860499 I always see the job through.
922561 924688 (snoring)
932237 935657 It's you. Any information?
937951 940621 Too much.
940704 943665 He said quite a bit<br />that should interest you.
943749 946460 And one or two things that interested me.
946543 948712 Such as?
948795 952716 The name Jackson's hiding under<br />is Bill Carson.
955594 958597 That's your bit.
959848 961934 Keep talking.
962017 965896 He also mentioned something<br />about a certain cash box
965979 968941 which just happened to disappear.
969024 970943 That's my bit.
971026 973153 Anything else?
973237 975489 Not enough for you, eh?
975572 979660 Well, you don't have to worry.<br />He'll never say anything to anybody again.
980244 982454 Oh, yeah. Perfect.
983121 985749 Here... Here you are.
985832 989294 Here, this is for you.<br />You did a good job for me.
989378 991880 Worth 500 dollars.
991964 994091 (coughs weakly)
994174 997386 Yeah. I almost forgot.
997469 999930 He gave me a thousand.
1000013 1003183 I think his idea<br />was that I kill you. (chuckles)
1009773 1015153 But you know, the pity is, when I'm paid<br />I always follow my job through.
1015237 1017030 You know that.
1017114 1019908 No! Angel Eyes!
1039928 1041763 (chuckles)
1050063 1052315 (gun cocking)
1063869 1066204 No. No pistol, amigo.
1066288 1070459 It won't do you any good.<br />There are three of us.
1084639 1086308 Hey, amigo...
1086391 1091646 You know you got a face beautiful enough<br />to be worth 2,000 dollars?
1091730 1093523 (laughter)
1093607 1096485 (new voice) Yeah...
1096568 1100739 But you don't look like the one<br />who'll collect it.
1107204 1109915 A couple of steps back.
1163718 1165804 Thank you.
1174562 1176898 How much are you worth now?
1176982 1178984 How much?
1179401 1181903 2,000 dollars.
1183571 1186074 That's right, 2,000 dollars.
1186157 1188868 2,000 dollars. (chuckles)
1194499 1198628 !Hijo de puta que te pariَ!<br />You'll pay for this!
1198712 1201214 I hope you end up in a graveyard,
1201298 1204301 with the cholera and the rabies<br />and the plague!
1204384 1209264 Cut me loose! Cut me loose,<br />you filthy bastard! Put me down!
1209347 1212309 I hope your mother ends up<br />in a two-dollar whorehouse!
1212392 1214811 Cut me loose!
1215854 1220817 You can still save yourself.<br />Let me go and I'll pardon you.
1220900 1222986 Let me go.
1223069 1227824 I feel sick.<br />The blood is rushing to my...
1227907 1232829 I'm dry, Blondie.<br />Agua... Water...
1233872 1236624 (dirty laugh)
1238501 1240128 You swine!
1240211 1243673 You son of a bitch! Let me go!
1243757 1247302 You're brave with a man who's tied up.<br />Come back.
1247385 1250138 Come back and fight.
1250221 1252098 You bastard.
1253058 1256936 Who the hell is that?<br />One bastard goes in, another comes out.
1257020 1260690 - Cut it out.<br />- I'm an honest farmer.
1260774 1263068 I'm innocent of everything.
1264861 1266905 So you're an honest farmer?
1266988 1269532 You recognise this man?
1269616 1272494 Yeah, it's you.
1272577 1276581 Me? Who says so?<br />You can't even read.
1276664 1280960 Roll it up. I'll give you a good idea<br />where you can put it.
1281044 1284589 To hell with all you sheriffs<br />and all who gave birth to you.
1284672 1288092 Hey, everybody, look!<br />He's giving him the filthy money!
1288176 1293556 Judas! You sold my hide. But you won't<br />enjoy that money, not a penny.
1293640 1297727 If there's justice in the world,<br />that money will go to the undertaker.
1297811 1299687 You know who you are?
1299771 1302148 Want to know whose son you are?
1302232 1304692 You don't. I do. Everybody does.
1304776 1308321 You're the son of a thousand fathers,<br />all bastards like you.
1308404 1311199 And your mother, she's...
1311282 1313660 You bastard!
1313743 1318373 Your mother, it's better not to talk of her!<br />I never hurt anybody!
1318456 1324546 Wanted in 1 4 counties of this state,<br />the condemned is found guilty
1324629 1331719 of the crimes of murder, armed robbery<br />of citizens, state banks and post offices,
1331803 1335723 the theft of sacred objects,<br />arson in a state prison,
1335807 1340603 perjury, bigamy,<br />deserting his wife and children,
1340687 1343189 inciting prostitution, kidnapping,
1343273 1347777 extortion, receiving stolen goods,<br />selling stolen goods,
1347860 1352949 passing counterfeit money, and,<br />contrary to the laws of this state,
1353032 1357495 the condemned is guilty<br />of using marked cards...
1357579 1361666 Therefore, according<br />to the powers vested in us,
1361749 1364752 we sentence the accused here before us,
1364836 1368631 Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan-Maria Ramirez...
1368715 1371843 Known as "The Rat".
1373594 1375680 ..to hang by the neck until dead.
1375763 1379309 May God have mercy on his soul.<br />Proceed.
1405335 1407378 Five for you.
1407462 1411632 One, two, three, four... five for me.
1413551 1418181 Five for you and five for me.
1418264 1420600 Know how much you're worth now?
1420683 1424145 - No. How much?<br />- 3,000 dollars.
1424979 1427065 (gratified grunt)
1427982 1430902 There are two kinds of people<br />in the world, my friend:
1430985 1435490 those with a rope around their neck<br />and the people who do the cutting.
1435573 1440453 The neck at the end of the rope is mine.<br />I run the risks.
1440536 1444248 So the next time I want more than half.
1444332 1448961 You may run the risks, my friend,<br />but I do the cutting.
1450004 1454258 If we cut down my percentage...
1454342 1456594 Cigar?
1457637 1460056 ..Iiable to interfere with my aim.
1462475 1466187 But if you miss,<br />you had better miss very well.
1466270 1470274 Whoever double-crosses me<br />and leaves me alive,
1470358 1474320 he understands nothing about Tuco.
1474403 1476489 Nothing.
1479617 1481786 Wanted in 15 counties of this state,
1481869 1485581 the condemned standing before us...<br />sitting before us,
1485665 1489126 Tuco Benedicto Pacيfico<br />Juan-Maria Ramirez,
1489210 1493214 has been found guilty by the circuit court<br />of the following crimes:
1493297 1498302 murder, assaulting a justice of the peace,<br />raping a virgin of the white race,
1498386 1501764 statutory rape of a minor<br />of the black race,
1501848 1503432 derailing a train...
1503516 1506143 Hey, Angel Eyes.
1512024 1515653 - What d'you find out, Shorty?<br />- If you ask me, it seems like a book.
1515736 1519949 A unit escorting a cash box of gold coins<br />meets a Yankee ambush
1520032 1524954 and only three of 'em are saved -<br />Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.
1525037 1527582 What wasn't saved was the coins.
1527665 1531627 But the army holds a hearing,<br />and Jackson's acquitted.
1531711 1534547 He disappears and becomes Bill Carson.
1534630 1538801 - I know his name.<br />- But not who you're looking for. I do.
1538884 1543681 And when he's found,<br />I'd be scared to be put in his shoes.
1545099 1546559 Where is Carson?
1546642 1549854 All I know is Carson re-enlisted.<br />The poor guy's minus an eye.
1549937 1554275 He lives with a girl called Maria.<br />She's a fresh young whore in the territory.
1554358 1557612 - Where is she?<br />- Now, what's the name of that town?
1557695 1559488 Someplace fairly near.
1561907 1563326 Santa Ana.
1566454 1569582 Adios, half-soldier.
1573127 1575212 Hey, Luke, hand me down a whiskey.
1575296 1577548 ..and the sheriff's office in Sonora.
1577631 1580718 He then hired himself out<br />as guide to a wagon train,
1580801 1583054 and, after receiving payment in advance,
1583137 1586599 deserted the wagon train on<br />the hunting grounds of the Sioux Indians.
1586682 1590519 I'm glad they got him.<br />A man guilty of all those crimes.
1590603 1595191 - Convicted people don't always hang.<br />- What do you mean?
1596233 1599362 Even a filthy beggar like that<br />has got a protecting angel.
1606285 1610206 A golden-haired angel watches over him.
1610289 1614126 (judge) For all these crimes,<br />the accused has made a full confession.
1614210 1617755 Therefore, we condemn him<br />to be hung by the neck until dead.
1617838 1620716 May the Lord have mercy on his soul.<br />Proceed.
1636232 1639360 Let's get the hell out of here!
1669807 1672685 What are you trying to say?<br />Anybody can miss a shot?
1672768 1674812 Nobody misses<br />when I'm at the end of the rope.
1674895 1678274 You never had a rope round your neck.<br />Let me tell you something.
1678357 1683654 When that rope starts to pull tight,<br />you can feel the devil bite your ass.
1685573 1687741 Yeah. You're right.
1687825 1690494 It's getting tougher.
1691078 1697167 The way I figure, there's really not too<br />much future with a sawn-off runt like you.
1697251 1698544 What do you mean?
1698627 1702548 I don't think you'll ever<br />be worth more than 3,000 dollars.
1703382 1705593 What do you mean?
1705676 1708512 I mean our partnership is untied.
1709597 1711599 Oh, no, not you.
1711682 1713475 You remain tied.
1713559 1716562 I'll keep the money<br />and you can have the rope.
1716645 1720774 You filthy, double-crossing bastard.<br />Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...
1720858 1723861 The way back to town is only 70 miles.
1724945 1728157 If you save your breath,<br />I feel a man like you could manage it.
1728782 1729992 Adios.
1730075 1733287 You filthy bastard! Come here!
1733704 1738751 Come here. Cut this rope off.<br />Get off that horse, you filthy coward.
1738834 1742087 If I ever catch you, Blondie,<br />I'll rip your heart out and eat it!
1742171 1747176 I'll skin you alive! I'll hang you up<br />by your thumbs! You pig! You vulture!
1747259 1749803 I'll kill you! I'll kill you!
1749887 1751764 (tsks)
1751847 1756226 Such ingratitude.<br />After all the times I've saved your life.
1761065 1763901 Wait a minute.<br />This is only a trick.
1763984 1766945 You wouldn't leave me here. Come back.
1767029 1770866 Wait, Blondie! Listen...
1770949 1774370 !Hijo de una gran puta!
1774453 1777539 (echoes into theme music)
1783962 1786924 (drunken singing)
1791970 1794098 (laughter)
1795057 1798268 I believe madam is home.
1798352 1800437 Sweet dreams.
1811323 1814034 You filthy rats!
1829508 1831969 (man, quietly) Maria?
1838058 1841145 Is that you, Bill?
1841228 1843147 Bill!
1844314 1846108 Arh!
1852281 1854158 Who are you?
1854241 1856201 What do you want with me?
1856285 1859621 Go on talking about Bill Carson.
1859705 1862416 I don't know him.
1862499 1865752 You were calling to him in the dark.
1869590 1870716 Where is he?
1870799 1873135 What are you gonna do to him?
1874511 1876722 I'll ask the questions.
1878515 1880934 Where is he?
1887691 1889568 Where is he? Where?
1889651 1892362 Where? Where?
1892446 1894740 Where?
1897534 1899620 That's enough.
1900871 1904166 I don't know where he is.<br />He packed his things ten days ago
1904249 1907586 and went away with his unit. They all left.
1907669 1909838 Which company? Where did they go?
1912591 1913884 Hm?
1913967 1918889 3rd Cavalry. General Sibley.<br />They left for Santa Fe.
1919973 1923185 That's all I know. I swear.
1976738 1979032 (pained gasp)
2008603 2010689 But... but...
2014818 2017529 I'm very sorry, but the store is closing.
2017612 2019281 Mm-hm.
2031960 2034045 (chuckles)
2055817 2059613 - Revolvers!<br />- Yeah, revolvers.
2063241 2065118 Revolvers.
2065202 2069456 Well, here's where I keep the best ones.
2073585 2076880 Here, Remington, Colt,
2076963 2079758 a Root, Smith-Wesson,
2079841 2084137 Colt - navy, Joslyn,
2084220 2086431 another Remington, and this one...
2086514 2087974 That's enough.
2131309 2133645 Cartridges.
2141444 2145699 - You wanna try the pistol, step out back.<br />- Let's go.
2150745 2152831 Move, move.
2201171 2203715 (chuckles)
2227655 2229741 Cartridge.
2237624 2240752 - How much?<br />- Twenty dollars.
2241794 2244839 (chuckles) No.
2247508 2250595 Fifty dollars.
2250678 2255141 - How much?<br />- A hundred dollars.
2257268 2261356 Two hundred dollars. It's all I've got.
2261439 2263524 Here.
2282502 2285004 Come here.
2291094 2292762 - Aaah..<br />- Ahh...
2295181 2298518 - (chuckles) Heh?<br />- Mm-hm.
2303106 2308319 (Tuco) If you work for a living,<br />why do you kill yourself working?
2345648 2351946 If you work for a living,<br />why do you kill yourself working?
2378389 2380475 Potatoes.
2381184 2384479 You've gotta be poor to eat potatoes.
2385396 2387523 Really poor.
2387607 2391152 I'm rich. But I'm lonely.
2393404 2396282 The world is divided into two parts:
2396365 2402371 those who have friends,<br />and those who are lonely, like poor Tuco.
2403998 2408878 You see, I used to have a friend - Pedro.
2409795 2413382 Chico and Ramَn, his two brothers,<br />were my friends too.
2416844 2420139 But who knows where they are now?
2420890 2424685 Ah, it's too bad, friends.<br />Tough luck I haven't found you.
2424769 2427063 I had a good deal for you.
2429315 2433277 There's a big son of a bitch<br />who's got 4,000 dollars.
2434195 2439700 4,000 dollars.<br />And I know where to find it.
2442119 2447500 If they would help me catch him,<br />I'd divide it four ways, like a brother.
2448084 2451295 1,000 dollars each. Hm?
2468521 2471607 You're alive, Tuco. Is it true?
2474402 2476946 And rich. Like you're going to be.
2477029 2479949 But people are saying<br />you got killed in Albuquerque.
2480032 2482285 And people talk bullshit.
2485997 2489333 I'm alive, you bastards,<br />and I always will be.
2489417 2492753 And I've come to give you 3,000 dollars.
2492837 2494922 Vamos.
2511105 2513232 This morning I heard the whole thing.
2513315 2518487 Canby's closing in with his northerners<br />and tomorrow they'll be in the city.
2518571 2521282 That's why these southerners<br />are getting out.
2521365 2524827 As soon as these cowards<br />hear of blue-shirts around, they run.
2525870 2528789 - These rebels have no will to fight.<br />- Poor things.
2528873 2534170 They'll soon be finished. Then we begin<br />making money on those Yankees.
2534253 2536630 They carry gold, not paper dollars.
2536714 2539592 And they're going to beat the South.
2539675 2544889 Look. See that one with the white beard,<br />General Sibley? He looks dead.
2544972 2546974 He's finally getting out of our hair.
2547057 2551937 Hooray for Dixie!<br />Hooray, hooray for Dixie!
2555649 2558736 Where's the owner of that horse?
2558819 2561989 - Please, mister... A bad heart...<br />- Where?
2562072 2567077 - The war's frightened me already.<br />- I'm looking for the owner of that horse.
2567161 2572249 He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar<br />and he's a pig. Where is he now?
2572333 2575211 He doesn't know who rides every horse.
2575294 2578881 You stay quiet, old hen.
2578964 2583135 Upstairs in room four, seٌor.
2588224 2590518 Hear that?
2595147 2599151 You rotten criminals. How dare you?
2601529 2604448 (rumble of wagons outside)
2723358 2725444 (chink of spurs)
2731075 2733660 (distant cannon fire)
2792803 2795389 Your spurs.
2803438 2805524 (Tuco chuckles)
2809570 2812406 There are two kinds of spurs, my friend:
2812489 2817953 those that come in by the door,<br />and those that come in by the window.
2818036 2821164 Take off that pistol belt.
2827629 2829089 It's empty.
2831717 2835012 - Mine isn't.<br />- (closer cannon fire)
2839975 2843770 Even when Judas hanged himself,<br />there was a storm, too.
2847107 2849484 That could be cannon fire.
2849568 2854114 Cannon fire or storm,<br />it's all the same to you.
2855615 2859536 You ever see this before, my friend?
2867502 2871173 Throw it over the roof beam.
2871840 2873300 That's it.
2884978 2887064 Now get on that.
2896907 2898784 That's right.
2898867 2901369 Now make sure the rope is tight.
2901453 2904581 It's got to hold the weight of a pig.
2910879 2914382 Now put the rope around your neck.
2920222 2923058 That's very good.
2923141 2926978 It's too big for your neck, huh?<br />We fix that right away.
2927062 2931316 I have another system.<br />A little different than yours.
2932234 2936446 I don't shoot the rope,<br />I shoot the legs off the stool.
2940992 2943078 Adiَs.
3132559 3134227 Welcome, my friend.
3134310 3137814 If you're looking for a summer<br />vacation spot, you've found it.
3137897 3141401 Our hotel is luxurious<br />and filled with conveniences.
3141484 3143361 (laughter)
3143444 3145572 And the attractions don't stop there.
3145655 3149868 International cuisine,<br />healthful and nutritious food.
3149951 3152036 Corn cobs, Dixie-style.
3152120 3154622 Our government has spared no expense.
3154706 3157584 As you can see, we are treated very well.
3157667 3161254 Have you ever heard of anyone<br />by the name of Bill Carson?
3161337 3166509 And you? Have you ever heard<br />of someone named Canby? No?
3166593 3170930 Well, you see, he's a Yankee colonel<br />who decided to tear us to pieces.
3171014 3174100 The only thing we care about<br />is saving our own hides.
3174183 3177103 And you ask me if I know someone.
3177186 3181357 I just don't know what you drifters<br />could be thinking.
3192118 3196289 Carson has a patch over one eye.<br />He's with the 3rd.
3198041 3202086 If he's with the 3rd...<br />They've already left.
3202170 3203796 For Glorietta.
3203880 3208092 Canby's front line is right on their heels.<br />Those poor young devils.
3208176 3214098 And the desert lies ahead of 'em. I really<br />doubt that any of them are still alive.
3214182 3216726 And what if they were still alive?
3219062 3221314 Worse.
3221397 3225068 Well, then, you must not have<br />heard anything about Batterville.
3225151 3231032 It's one of those Yankee prison camps<br />you'd better hope you never end up in.
3231115 3233618 Keep it. It's yours.
3378387 3382433 We have found the accused,<br />Thomas Larson, alias Shorty Larson,
3382516 3385102 guilty of the following crimes:
3385186 3389774 horse-theft, theft of supplies<br />belonging to the Union army...
3404205 3406040 And Shorty?
3410795 3411962 No.
3413172 3415800 No?
3416092 3419845 ..alias Shorty Larson,<br />to hang by the neck until dead.
3419929 3423224 May God have mercy on his soul.<br />Proceed.
3429730 3431399 Sorry, Shorty.
3432817 3435528 Move. Come on, let's go.
3460136 3463180 I don't know...<br />As soon as I hit the desert, I'm thirsty.
3463264 3469145 It burns, huh? They say people<br />with fair skin can't take too much.
3492501 3496338 Like that,<br />you won't have to carry so much.
3497339 3499717 Where are we going?
3499800 3501302 Where?
3501385 3503846 Where I'm going, amigo.
3503929 3505723 Over that way.
3505806 3509643 Another 100 miles<br />of beautiful sun-baked sand.
3509727 3512396 Even the armies are afraid<br />to march through there.
3512479 3515065 Sibley's men are retreating up there.
3515149 3518319 Canby's men are coming here.
3518402 3522364 But no-one will set foot in this hell.
3522448 3525159 Except you and me.
3526327 3529705 100 miles. That's a nice walk.
3532249 3535711 What was it you told me the last time?
3536962 3541759 If you save your breath,<br />I feel a man like you could manage it.
3542927 3547389 And if you won't manage it,<br />you'll die - only slowly.
3548599 3552102 Very slowly, old friend.
3556148 3557942 After you, please.
3558025 3560110 Start walking.
3664423 3666508 (Tuco laughs)
3675684 3678020 Taking a rest?
3678479 3682858 Come on, Blondie. We don't have<br />very far to go. Only 70 miles.
3684109 3687905 Only eight and a half hours more<br />before sunset.
3687988 3690532 That's not too bad.
3691575 3692910 Come on.
3729988 3732491 (chuckles heartily)
3736912 3738789 Whoa...
3803520 3806022 OK, let's eat.
3806106 3809860 That is, I'll eat.
3811611 3815866 Meanwhile, you can enjoy a sunbath.
3823790 3826334 You want some water?
3830088 3831840 Drink.
3837846 3840056 Come on.
3881056 3884434 Well, Blondie... So long.
3951209 3954129 And so, Blondie...
3955755 3958258 it's goodbye.
3958341 3961261 (rumble of hooves)
4014105 4016357 Whoa, whoa...
4021154 4022781 Easy, easy.
4022864 4025617 Easy. Attaboy.
4163546 4165882 (creaking)
4174599 4176684 Water...
4184025 4189030 200,000 in gold.<br />It's yours, just get me water.
4192867 4194911 What's that you say?
4194994 4198748 - Who the hell are you?<br />- Carson.
4198831 4202251 My name is Bill Carson now.
4202335 4205088 Surprise attack...
4205171 4209717 AII dead...<br />My name is Jackson, not Carson...
4209801 4213221 Carson, yeah. Glad to meet you.<br />I'm Lincoln's grandfather.
4213304 4219018 - What's that you said about the dollars?<br />- 200,000, all mine.
4219101 4222104 It was the 3rd Cavalry's.
4222188 4225066 Baker has nothing.
4225149 4228945 The gold... I hid the gold.<br />The gold is safe.
4230154 4233074 Where? Here?
4233157 4237245 - Talk.<br />- In... the... cemetery.
4237328 4239038 Which cemetery?
4239121 4242792 The one on Sad Hill.
4242875 4245127 There's a grave...
4245211 4248256 Which grave? Have a name?
4248339 4253135 Have a number?<br />Come on, you dummy, talk.
4253219 4256264 There's... no number.
4256347 4258891 There's a name.
4258975 4261477 It's written...
4263563 4265648 (croaks)
4267858 4270778 - Water...<br />- (frustrated grunt)
4271821 4274699 You talk first. I'll give you water later.
4274782 4277910 Sad Hill cemetery. OK.<br />In the grave. OK.
4277994 4284083 But it must have a name or a number.<br />There must be 1,000... 5,000...
4287587 4291632 Don't die, uh? Don't die.<br />I'll get you water.
4291716 4295428 Stay there. Don't move.<br />I'll get you water.
4295511 4298472 Don't die until later, you son of a...
4319035 4321495 (yells)
4323539 4326667 Get away from there.
4331213 4333382 He's dead.
4336677 4339180 I'll kill you.
4341140 4345061 If you do that, you'll always be poor.
4345144 4348272 Just like the greasy rat that you are.
4348814 4353069 If I were you, I'd... keep me alive.
4353152 4356280 What did he tell you?
4356364 4358741 A name.
4358824 4363120 - The name on a grave.<br />- What name?
4376509 4378594 Blondie... Don't die.
4378677 4380763 Blondie, don't die.
4380846 4383557 I'm your friend. Please don't die.
4383641 4386185 I'm your friend. Come on.
4386268 4387853 Come on, eh?
4387937 4391398 Blondie, I'll help you. I'll help you.
4391482 4394443 Don't move. I'll be right back.<br />I'll get the water.
4394527 4398405 Don't die like that pig.
4398489 4400574 Here's water, Blondie.
4400658 4404286 Don't drink, it's no good for you.<br />Feel better?
4404370 4408582 Blondie, what's the matter?<br />Please don't die.
4416882 4420302 (Tuco) Hey, open up! Hurry!
4420386 4423514 Settle down. Who's there?
4424849 4429228 What do you mean, "who's there?"<br />You think I'm the enemy?
4431438 4435401 If I were a Yankee,<br />you wouldn't have time to ask me that.
4435484 4436735 Come on.
4436819 4440364 Sergeant, listen to<br />this corporal for a moment.
4440447 4446287 Sergeant, I have a gravely wounded man<br />here, if he's not dead already.
4447705 4451750 - He's still alive?<br />- Well, he seems to be.
4451834 4453878 - What happened?<br />- It was a trap.
4453961 4458799 - Only the two of us got away.<br />- Name and travelling papers.
4459925 4463971 Here. Corporal Bill Carson.<br />3rd Regiment, 2nd Cavalry Squadron,
4464054 4467766 arriving from San Rafael.<br />Is that enough?
4472396 4474857 Are you reading when this man is dying?
4474940 4478736 Why, Corporal, we're trying to withdraw<br />and you're looking for an infirmary?
4478819 4482948 If you want one, you'll have<br />to make yourself a Yankee prisoner.
4483616 4487202 - So where are we?<br />- Near Apache Canyon.
4488537 4490998 Apache Canyon?
4491081 4493584 Is a mission San Antonio around here?
4493667 4495836 18 miles south. Take him there.
4495919 4499590 The brothers take care of any wounded,<br />whatever the colour of his uniform.
4499673 4502676 And keep your eyes open -<br />the area is full of Yankees.
4502760 4504345 Thank you.<br />Goodbye, Sergeant.
4504428 4506430 Take care.
4525115 4527201 Whoa!
4530245 4533499 - Got a very sick man here.<br />- But we have no more beds.
4533582 4536085 Let him have yours.
4541006 4545135 - Where's Padre Ramirez?<br />- Father Ramirez is away at the moment.
4545219 4547638 He should be back any day now.
4547721 4551892 It doesn't matter. For the moment,<br />we take very good care of my friend.
4551975 4553811 And may God be praised.
4553894 4559483 God is on our side too, because<br />he hates the Yankees. Huh, Blondie?
4560859 4564822 - Father, is he still breathing?<br />- Yes, of course.
4564905 4566990 You're heavy.
4577793 4579878 There.
4608615 4611743 AII right. Put a fresh bandage on him.
4612703 4615497 Put him in my cell.
4615581 4617666 Easy.
4620043 4622379 Out, soldier. Out you go.
4622462 4626300 Look after him, please.<br />He's like a brother to me.
4630929 4632931 Hey, Father, l...
4640397 4642566 (mutters)
4645694 4649448 Father, did he speak?<br />Did he say anything?
4678352 4681313 Father, did he ask for me?<br />Did he speak about anything?
4681396 4683148 No, he hasn't spoken as yet.
4683231 4688445 But don't worry, he's young and strong -<br />that's what's kept him going.
4688528 4690864 He should regain his strength<br />in a short time.
4690947 4693659 Thank you. You don't know<br />what this boy's life means to me.
4693742 4696370 Thanks be to Jesus.
4745168 4746461 Blondie?
4752008 4755137 Hey, Blondie?
4773321 4777701 The old Father tells me<br />you'll be up and around in a few days.
4777784 4781621 You were very lucky to have me<br />so close when it happened.
4781705 4785292 Think if you'd been on your own.
4785375 4790755 Look, I mean when one is... ill,
4790839 4796052 it's good to have somebody close by,<br />friends or relations.
4796136 4801808 Do you... you have parents, Blondie?<br />A mother?
4802350 4804811 Not even a mother.
4805353 4807439 No-one?
4807522 4810984 You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.
4811067 4813820 We're all alone in the world.
4813904 4817032 I have you, you have me.
4818742 4821244 Only for a little while, I mean.
4821328 4826583 It had to happen now.<br />What a dirty, rotten trick of fate.
4826666 4830712 We could have all that money<br />in our hands.
4834799 4841306 I... I must tell you the truth, Blondie.<br />In my place, you would do the same thing.
4842974 4846186 It's all over for you now.
4846269 4850148 There's nothing anyone can do any more.
4851566 4853526 Oh, God, forgive me.
4853610 4856738 It's my fault, mine, mine, mine, mine!
4867290 4869876 I'll tell you one thing, Blondie.
4869959 4873588 If I knew that my last hour had come,<br />I swear,
4873672 4877926 in my place...<br />in your place I would do the same thing.
4878009 4881554 I would tell about the gold.<br />Yes, yes, I would.
4881638 4883973 I would tell the name on the grave.
4884057 4888645 What good is the money if you're dead?<br />I know the name of the cemetery.
4888728 4891940 But you know how many graves<br />there are there?
4892023 4897904 Please. Blondie, please.<br />Have a little...
4900865 4904244 Coffee?<br />Please, tell me the name.
4904327 4906913 On... on the grave.
4908289 4912752 If I get my hands on the 200,000 dollars,
4912836 4915839 I'll always honour your memory.
4915922 4920218 I swear, I'll always honour your memory.
4922178 4924139 Come closer.
4929018 4931104 Tell me.
4932480 4934941 You dirty...
4936651 4939237 I'll sleep better...
4939320 4943783 knowing my good friend is by my side...
4943867 4946244 to protect me.
4955003 4957338 "Tuco, water." Well, here's water.
4957422 4962093 But if I get that name from you,<br />I'll give you water! I'll give you...
4968141 4970977 AII right, you dirty skunk,<br />get your ass off the bed.
4971060 4974856 Come on. The party's over.<br />The wagon is all ready to go.
4974939 4980320 We'd better get the hell out of here,<br />before we get caught up in the war.
4980403 4983448 Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
4983531 4988411 This is something I have to look into.<br />It'll only take a minute. Get moving.
4988494 4991080 - Where? This way?<br />- Yes.
5007680 5009974 Hey, Pablo?
5016648 5019275 Don't you recognise me?
5020818 5023321 It's me. Tuco.
5023404 5026532 Let me embrace you...
5028534 5031746 I don't know the right thing.
5035917 5042173 I was passing by and said to myself<br />"I wonder if my brother remembers me?"
5044717 5047053 Did I do wrong?
5047553 5050056 It doesn't matter. I'm very happy.
5050139 5052392 You have seen me, Tuco.
5054310 5057271 Yeah, well, I'm very glad I came.
5062860 5064946 Ah, my uniform.
5065029 5067115 It's a long story.
5067240 5070618 But let's talk about you.<br />It's more important.
5070702 5075373 You look very well.<br />A bit thin, perhaps, but...
5077041 5080837 You were always thin, eh, Pablito?
5081754 5084799 Wh... What about our parents?
5086300 5092140 Only now do you think of them.<br />To begin after nine years.
5094058 5096936 Nine years?
5097019 5099731 So it's nine years.
5099814 5101399 Nine years.
5102066 5104902 Our mother has been dead<br />a long time now.
5106320 5111868 Our father died only a few days ago.<br />That's why I was away.
5113411 5115913 He asked for you to be there.
5115997 5119125 But there was only me.
5125006 5127175 And you?
5127258 5131471 Outside of evil,<br />what else have you managed to do?
5131554 5136392 It seems to me<br />you once had a wife someplace.
5137810 5139729 Not one. Lots of them.
5139812 5143608 One here, one there,<br />wherever I found them.
5143691 5148112 Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
5148196 5151532 What good would that be?
5151616 5154285 Just keep on the way you're going.
5154368 5156787 Go away.
5156871 5159457 - The Lord have mercy on your soul.<br />- Sure, I'll go.
5159540 5162335 While I'm waiting<br />for the Lord to remember me!
5162418 5167715 I, Tuco Ramirez, brother of Brother<br />Ramirez, will tell you something.
5167798 5170218 You think you're better than I am.
5170301 5175223 Where we came from,<br />one became a priest or a bandit.
5175306 5179685 You chose your way, I chose mine.<br />Mine was harder.
5179769 5182063 You talk of our mother and father -
5182146 5184815 when you left to become a priest,<br />I stayed behind.
5184899 5189028 I must have been 10, 12,<br />I don't remember. But I stayed.
5189111 5193241 I tried, but it was no good.<br />Now I'll tell you something.
5193324 5199330 You became a priest because you were<br />too much of a coward to do what I do.
5216764 5218432 Tuco.
5228943 5231195 Please forgive me, brother.
5242456 5244375 Haa!
5260224 5264145 Ah, my belly's full.
5264228 5266480 Nice guy, my brother.
5266564 5269108 I didn't tell you<br />my brother was in charge here?
5269191 5273571 Everything. Like the Pope, almost.<br />He's in charge in Rome.
5273654 5278909 My brother, he say to me<br />"Stay, brother, we never see each other."
5278993 5282913 "There's plenty to eat and drink.<br />Bring your friend too."
5282997 5287168 Whenever we see each other,<br />he never lets me go.
5288210 5291338 My brother, he's crazy about me.
5294842 5299930 That's so. Even a tramp like me,<br />no matter what happens,
5300014 5305102 I know there's a brother somewhere<br />who'll never refuse me a bowl of soup.
5306645 5309315 Sure.
5309398 5314195 Well, after a meal<br />there's nothing like a good cigar.
5363994 5367164 Here's the Sierra Magdalena.
5367248 5370459 Going this way, we cross the Rio Grande.
5370542 5373587 That sure is a long way.
5373671 5377800 Here to the northwest,<br />through all of Texas...
5377883 5380052 - After that...<br />- Then what?
5382137 5386934 When we get there, I'll tell you.<br />You're not worried, are you?
5388978 5393357 Those men aren't worried<br />about anything any more, are they?
5395192 5401448 But since I'm alive and I've noticed<br />we'll be crossing enemy lines a few times,
5401532 5404785 I thought you might tell me<br />where we're going.
5404868 5408956 Towards 200,000 dollars.<br />Is that good enough for you?
5417798 5419883 Whoa.
5420551 5422720 (growls)
5428350 5430227 Wake up, you.
5430310 5433772 - There are troops coming.<br />- Blue or grey?
5440195 5443907 They're grey, like us.<br />Let's say hello to them, then get going.
5443991 5447870 Hurrah! Hurrah for the Confederacy!
5447953 5451331 Hurrah! Down with General Grant!
5451415 5453250 Hurrah for General...
5453333 5455044 - What's his name?<br />- Lee.
5455127 5456628 ..Lee!
5457004 5462092 God is with us because<br />he hates the Yanks, too! Hurrah!
5462176 5465929 God's not on our side,<br />cos he hates idiots also.
5478192 5482279 Hup, two, three, four.<br />Hup, two, three, four.
5482362 5486074 Hup, two, three, four.<br />Hup, two, three four...
5486158 5489411 Prisoners of war, forward...
5490537 5492289 march.
5492372 5495542 Hup, two, three, four...
5548679 5551348 Left face.
5554184 5558730 Form a single file. Move.
5588844 5592055 (corporal takes prisoner roll call)
5599604 5602983 - Jonathan Broad.<br />- Present.
5609114 5611825 - Richard Mobiley.<br />- Present.
5611908 5615829 - Nathaniel Sullivan.<br />- Present.
5616288 5619416 - Robert Clark.<br />- Present.
5620042 5622919 - Sam Richmond.<br />- Present.
5626089 5628175 Bill Carson.
5630886 5633388 Bill Carson?
5633847 5636308 I said Bill Carson.
5636391 5639186 Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?
5640020 5646068 AII right, what's he doing, sleeping?<br />Bill Carson!
5646151 5649029 Yeah. You better be Bill Carson.
5649112 5650781 Bill Carson!
5650864 5653992 Yeah, yeah... That's me.
5662000 5664211 Please, Carson...
5665253 5667339 answer "present".
5668715 5671510 What, are you deaf?
5676389 5678892 Now suppose you say "present", Carson.
5680936 5686024 I like big fat men like you -<br />when they fall, they make more noise.
5686107 5689194 And sometimes they never get up.
5689986 5691446 Wallace.
5692948 5694699 That's enough.
5697577 5698829 Sergeant.
5700956 5705126 The captain wants to see you right away.
5706878 5710423 Be sure these two get good treatment.
5719432 5723395 Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?<br />Good treatment.
5725689 5727774 Yeah.
5730235 5733780 For the last time, Sergeant,<br />I'm telling you,
5733863 5737784 I want the prisoners treated as prisoners.
5737867 5740829 No more brutality.
5740912 5744624 There's hundreds of prisoners<br />and only a few men to guard 'em.
5744708 5746793 I have to have respect.
5746876 5751881 I think you'll manage to gain their respect<br />by treating them better.
5753174 5755760 Are our men treated that well<br />in Andersonville camp?
5755844 5758722 I don't give a goddamn<br />what they do in Andersonville.
5758805 5765478 While I'm in charge, the prisoners are not<br />to be tortured or cheated... or murdered.
5766187 5767981 That an accusation?
5768064 5773278 Sergeant, gangrene is eating<br />my leg away, not my eyes.
5773778 5777282 I know the prisoners here<br />are being robbed systematically.
5777365 5780535 I know there's scum around,<br />bivouacked near the camp,
5780618 5783830 waiting for someone to deliver this loot.
5783913 5788918 But as long as I'm commandant, I won't<br />permit any such trickery. Am I clear?
5791212 5792756 Yes, sir.
5792839 5795216 Just as long as you're the commandant.
5796885 5798970 Yes, Sergeant.
5801097 5804851 I know this leg means<br />I won't last very long,
5804934 5811608 but I pray I have enough time to amass<br />evidence and bring to a court martial
5811691 5817739 all those who discredit and dishonour<br />the uniform of the Union.
5821993 5824704 I wish you luck.
5858404 5862742 You and the others<br />better lay low for a few days.
5862826 5867080 I'll keep this. You go.<br />Wallace will let you know.
5876923 5881469 - Wallace, bring me Carson.<br />- Right.
5894941 5899028 Angel Eyes said for us<br />to lay low for a few days.
5899112 5904409 We'll keep close enough to keep<br />an eye on things. Saddle your horses.
5904909 5906995 Get in.
5910582 5912750 (door is locked)
5915044 5918256 Come on in, Tuco. Don't be bashful.
5919549 5922677 There's no formalities here.
5933104 5935732 It's been a long time.
5935815 5938651 (Tuco's stomach rumbles)
5938735 5940945 You're hungry.
5941029 5943740 Sit down. Eat.
5962175 5965637 I knew it, I knew it!
5965720 5971851 The minute I saw you, I said to myself<br />"Look at that pig, Angel Eyes."
5972852 5976314 "I bet he got himself an easy job."
5978733 5981444 "And he never forgets a friend."
5981527 5984655 I never forget old friends, Tuco.
5986074 5987658 Right.
5987742 5991079 It's good to see old friends again.
5991162 5992705 Good.
5992789 5996209 Especially when they've come<br />from so far away.
5996292 5999837 And have so much to talk about.
5999921 6003299 And you do have a lot to talk about,<br />haven't you?
6005593 6009389 You were captured near Fort Craig?
6013559 6020066 If you were with Sibley, that means<br />you were coming from Santa Fe.
6031452 6036999 - Was it hard crossing the desert?<br />- Mm-hm. Very hard.
6037083 6040294 Especially if you don't have<br />anything to drink.
6042380 6048219 Why are you going under<br />the name of Bill Carson now?
6050930 6053683 One name is as good as another.
6053766 6056686 Not wise to use your own name.
6056769 6061149 Like you.<br />I bet they don't call you Angel Eyes.
6061232 6064193 Sergeant Angel Eyes!
6072160 6075246 Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?
6075329 6081335 Music? Yes, it's very good.<br />Very good for the digestion.
6093097 6095391 So...
6095474 6099520 Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
6103482 6106819 That fake, too?
6106903 6111115 Bill Carson's name's written on it.
6111198 6116037 Have some. It's Bill Carson's tobacco.
6118456 6120333 Aarh!
6121167 6124170 (mournful tune)
6198911 6203332 Was Carson dead or alive<br />when you found him?
6208254 6210548 What did he tell you about the money?
6210631 6213259 I don't...
6213342 6216053 I... I don't know what you're talking about.
6234446 6236365 More feeling.
6254800 6258470 You can sure consider yourself<br />much luckier than your pal.
6258554 6261515 Wallace will punch your friend<br />as long as the song goes.
6261599 6265144 So many of us<br />have had a session in there.
6285748 6289168 How's your digestion now?
6291879 6297259 - You'd better talk.<br />- I have nothing to tell you.
6323619 6326330 Play that fiddle, you.
6361615 6364076 (screams)
6369915 6372126 I'll talk... I'll talk...
6381593 6384388 What did he say about the money?
6384471 6387933 It's bu...
6388016 6391520 It's buried in a grave.
6391603 6393313 Where?
6393397 6394815 Sad Hill...
6394898 6397401 Sad Hill cemetery.
6400112 6402072 Which grave?
6402156 6406076 I don't know.<br />I don't know, I tell you.
6407703 6409663 Blondie...
6409746 6414543 Ask Blondie.<br />He knows the name of the grave.
6431226 6434354 The war's over for you.
6436315 6439443 Put those clothes on.
6442654 6444406 Why?
6444489 6447451 We're going for a ride.
6447534 6451538 - Where?<br />- To find 200,000 dollars.
6451622 6454833 I know the name of the cemetery now.
6454917 6458420 And you know the name of the grave.
6477481 6480609 You're not going to give me<br />the same treatment?
6484029 6485989 Would you talk?
6486823 6488575 No. Probably not.
6490327 6492913 That's what I thought.
6492996 6495374 Not that you're any tougher than Tuco,
6495457 6498835 but you're smart enough to know<br />that talking won't save you.
6502547 6505759 And Tuco? Is he...
6507844 6510931 No. Not yet.
6511014 6513600 But he's in very good hands.
6514309 6517813 You've changed partners,<br />but you've still got the same deal.
6517896 6520440 I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
6521775 6525737 There's two of us.<br />Should make it easier than just one.
6530575 6532661 Yeah.
6551930 6553390 Hold it.
6553473 6556268 That's it. Don't move.
6556351 6561898 Now, don't breathe. Still... that's it.
6561982 6565277 Got it. Thank you.
6579875 6583628 Hey, Corporal, afraid he'll get lost?<br />Where's the rebel going?
6583712 6587340 To hell, with a rope around his neck<br />and a price on his head.
6587424 6592554 3,000 dollars, friend.<br />That's a lot of money for a head.
6592637 6596391 I'll bet they didn't even pay you<br />a penny for your arm.
6601521 6603273 I told you once, friend.
6603356 6608195 If I ever get you down, you're gonna<br />need a lot of help to get up again.
6628131 6630342 You're a lot luckier than that one.
6630425 6633011 You get some grub, a rope,<br />and you're finished.
6633094 6636973 And there isn't any partner this time<br />to shoot you down.
6724644 6727313 (rustling)
6738074 6743079 If your friends stay out in the damp,<br />they're liable to catch a cold, aren't they?
6743163 6745540 Or a bullet.
6749669 6753047 Hear that, boys?<br />Come on out here.
6764267 6769189 Since we're all going in the same<br />direction, might as well go together.
6769272 6771733 One, two,
6771816 6773860 three, four,
6774360 6776738 five, six.
6777197 6780366 Six... Perfect number.
6781659 6784621 Isn't three the perfect number?
6785747 6790210 Yeah. But I got six more bullets in my gun.
6791794 6793880 (chuckles)
6796633 6798927 (train whistle)
6852605 6857277 Sure would like to<br />put your paw on it, huh?
6857360 6862073 I would like to piss. It's rough.<br />I've been on this train nearly ten hours.
6862156 6864951 You smell like a pig already.
6865034 6867870 Let's try not to make things any worse.
6870164 6872250 Get going.
6880466 6884137 I can't while you're watching me.
6895148 6897108 Aaaarh!
6906576 6910329 You made a lot of noise, my friend, huh?
6930641 6934604 You don't want to break our friendship?<br />Well, I'll break it.
6959212 6961798 (train approaching)
7038749 7041585 Squad, halt.
7041669 7044547 Take your places.
7054724 7056642 Ready.
7056726 7058227 Aim.
7058311 7060396 Fire.
7076120 7079415 Clem, take care of the horses.
7082626 7085129 (cannon fire)
7101937 7104690 (whistle of cannonball)
7290459 7292628 (splash of water)
7305974 7309186 (Tuco sings quietly to himself)
7334920 7338423 I've been looking for you for eight months.
7338507 7343095 Whenever I should have had a gun<br />in my right hand, I thought of you.
7343178 7347140 Now I find you in exactly<br />the position that suits me.
7347224 7353063 And I had lots of time to learn<br />how to shoot with my left.
7367035 7371665 When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.
7373292 7376378 Every gun makes its own tune.
7376461 7379923 It's perfect timing, large one.
7396773 7399318 Clem, follow him.
7433560 7434936 (tsks)
7445238 7448617 (banging on door)
7456375 7459378 Just a minute. I'll be right there.
7459461 7463215 Just give me time to get dressed<br />and I'll open up.
7480315 7482192 (gun cocks)
7483443 7486988 Put your drawers on<br />and take your gun off.
7495330 7497124 Hey...
7497207 7501878 Hey, Blondie, how the hell<br />did you get out of that pigsty?
7503380 7507801 My own way.<br />I'm here with your old friend Angel Eyes.
7508301 7511721 You talked, you traitor. You talked.
7512347 7517102 No, I didn't talk.<br />If I did, I probably wouldn't be here now.
7518395 7521022 You... me...
7521148 7523984 So only you know your half of the secret?
7524734 7526278 Mm-hm.
7527404 7531032 Ah, Blondie...
7531116 7535495 I'm very happy you're working with me,<br />and we're together again.
7535579 7539166 - I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.<br />- Oh, listen...
7539249 7543295 I forgot to mention.
7543378 7548133 He's not alone.<br />There's five of them.
7548216 7551595 - Five?<br />- Yeah. Five of them.
7553930 7557642 So that's why you came to Tuco.
7559728 7562439 It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.
7574075 7577287 They shot him at close range.
7577370 7579664 (whistle of cannonball)
7595764 7600727 - Well, look who's here.<br />- The other one will be along.
7602729 7606316 They'll come looking for us.
7606399 7608610 Watch out.
7608693 7611738 There's two of them.
7611821 7614074 I want that blond alive.
7622916 7626628 You, back there.<br />Come on, let's go.
7660286 7662622 Were you going to die alone?
7737488 7740408 (whistle of cannonball)
7747707 7749792 (coughing)
7768645 7769729 (whistles)
7772982 7774275 Ho!
7788581 7790166 (noise above)
7799342 7802428 Hey, Blondie. Angel Eyes is mine.
7802512 7804097 AII right.
7843428 7848224 "See you soon, l... idi.."
7848307 7850893 "Idiots."
7850977 7853271 It's for you.
7877503 7880465 How peaceful and quiet, amigo.
7880548 7884218 Like a cemetery, for instance?
7884302 7887221 There should be a bridge<br />across that river.
7887305 7892935 - We better wait for nightfall.<br />- Trust in me, Blondie.
7893019 7895771 I got a good sense of where I'm going.
7895855 7899901 Tuco has taken you this far,<br />I will take you all the way to...
7904947 7908034 - Tell the captain.<br />- Yes, sir.
7908117 7911454 Come along, now. Follow me.
7957124 7960670 We found them near the perimeter, sir.
7974141 7976352 Where do you hail from?
7976435 7977853 IIlinois.
7980272 7982149 And you?
7982233 7984110 I'm with him.
7990074 7993452 Any reason for being around here?
7993536 7996497 We want to enlist, General.
7999041 8001377 You'd better learn to distinguish rank.
8001460 8003546 I'm a captain.
8004880 8007675 Get the hell out.
8007758 8010761 It sure as hell might be you today,<br />so go write your will.
8010845 8012930 Yes, sir.
8017727 8019979 So you want to enlist?
8020896 8024650 You've got to take a test to prove it.
8032616 8035119 Well, show me.
8053053 8056140 Hey... (chuckles)
8057892 8062313 You've got a career.<br />At the least, I'd say you'll make colonel.
8062396 8065191 - Really?<br />- Sure.
8065274 8067401 Like it says in the manual,
8067485 8072865 you've got every qualification to become<br />an expert in the use of weapons.
8072948 8078078 For this, sir, is the most<br />potent weapon in war. (exhales)
8079830 8083459 The fighting spirit's in this bottle.
8084585 8086670 Volunteers.
8088130 8092593 You want to enlist, hm? Let's go.
8092676 8095804 Come on, gentlemen, come on.
8097264 8100726 The shooting hasn't begun yet.<br />You're in time.
8109193 8110736 Eh?
8116408 8119328 Whoever has the most liquor<br />to get the soldiers drunk
8119411 8123457 and send them to be slaughtered...<br />is the winner.
8123540 8129964 We and the ones over on the other side of<br />the river only have one thing in common.
8130047 8132424 AII of us reek of alcohol.
8140224 8142893 What did you say your name was?
8142977 8144311 Uh...
8145145 8147273 And you?
8148065 8149149 Uh...
8149233 8151235 "Uh." No.
8156240 8158951 Names don't matter.
8159034 8164623 Yes, because soon you can join<br />the gallant heroes of Branston Bridge.
8164707 8167001 We have two attacks a day.
8167084 8169753 - Two attacks a day?<br />- Sure.
8169837 8175009 The rebs have decided that damn bridge<br />is the key to this whole area.
8175092 8178220 Stupid, useless bridge.
8178303 8181557 Flyspeck on headquarters' maps.
8182599 8188105 Headquarters has declared<br />we must take that ridiculous flyspeck.
8189148 8191316 Even if all of us are killed.
8191400 8196989 Otherwise the key'll get rusty<br />and just be a spot on the wall.
8197072 8201785 And that's not all.<br />Both sides want the bridge intact.
8201869 8207124 Intact is how the South wants it,<br />and we want it intact, too.
8208959 8213297 You'll all turn to dust,<br />but one thing is sure, boys:
8213380 8217760 Branston Bridge will stand unbroken.
8217843 8223056 Is it bad<br />to speak the way I do to volunteers?
8223140 8226435 I've done a lot worse.
8229605 8234109 I've done it. I've blown it up. Boom!
8234193 8237404 In here, I've destroyed it all.
8238363 8243577 It's a court-martial offence to dream<br />of blowing it up. A serious crime.
8243660 8249291 Even to think of<br />destroying that bridge is just...
8250751 8253003 Why not really blow it up, Captain?
8254671 8258050 Yeah, Captain, it's nothing.<br />Let's scare the hell out of them.
8258133 8260469 (laughs)
8261470 8264598 I've been dreaming about it.
8267100 8270562 I've even worked out a plan.
8270646 8272648 I sure have.
8273565 8276860 The best time is after the attack,
8276944 8280822 when there's a truce<br />to get the wounded.
8280906 8285911 If I could do it,<br />I could save many thousands of men.
8285994 8288288 (soldiers shout)
8290874 8294002 But what I lack is the guts.
8299216 8302469 They're beginning<br />the daily slaughter right on time.
8302553 8305931 Captain, all companies<br />are awaiting your orders.
8306014 8308725 Be right there.
8321238 8323365 Let's go.
8323448 8325367 AII right, friends.
8325450 8328704 Come along and enjoy the spectacle.
8348765 8351560 (bugle call)
8359026 8361528 Companies, report.
8361611 8364406 Company B ready.
8364489 8367284 Company E ready.
8367367 8370495 Company D ready.
8375375 8379129 Companies, forward!
8379212 8381465 (battle cries)
8400067 8404029 Hey, Blondie. Looks like the captain<br />is asking for a bullet in his guts.
8404112 8406198 Yeah.
8458458 8462837 I've never seen so many men<br />wasted so badly.
8482440 8486820 I have a feeling it's really<br />going to be a good, long battle.
8490115 8492325 Blondie...
8492409 8495036 The money's on the other side of the river.
8495120 8498039 Oh? Where?
8500375 8504296 Amigo, I said the other side,<br />and that's enough.
8504379 8508925 But while the Confederates are there,<br />we can't get across.
8509009 8514139 What would happen if somebody<br />were to blow up that bridge?
8514222 8520228 Yeah. Then these idiots<br />would go somewhere else to fight.
8520312 8522397 Maybe.
8559559 8563563 Get a doctor, quick!<br />The captain's wounded!
8564856 8567734 Hurry, a stretcher.
8568818 8571654 Easy. Easy now.
8575533 8576951 Arh!
8581581 8584292 Get things ready.
8604145 8606981 A little of this will help.
8612570 8615031 Take a slug of this, Captain.
8615114 8617116 And keep your ears open.
8663705 8665707 (grunting)
8665790 8669627 (man) What are you doing?<br />No... Leave me alone...
8768017 8772105 Blondie, hey.<br />You realise we might be risking our lives?
8772647 8778402 Yeah. And if I get killed, you'll never get<br />your hands on all that beautiful money.
8778486 8780321 Yeah, Tuco.
8781239 8783574 Sure would be a pity.
8813479 8814647 Doc...
8816899 8821696 Doctor... Can you help me<br />Iive a little longer?
8821779 8824740 I expect good news.
8837003 8838546 (gasps)
8870620 8873372 Eh... Eh...
8874749 8877877 Why don't we tell each other<br />our half of the secret?
8877960 8880463 Why don't we?
8881505 8883549 You go first.
8885301 8890139 No, I think it's better that...
8890222 8892600 you start.
8895770 8898481 AII right.
8899315 8903903 The name of the cemetery is...
8919794 8922004 Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.
8930262 8933057 The name on the grave is...
8936519 8938562 Arch Stanton.
8938646 8942149 Ar... Arch Stanton?
8942233 8944485 Are you sure?
8944568 8946737 Yeah. Sure I'm sure.
9058974 9061310 (snoring)
9246787 9248956 (grunts)
9287160 9290080 (horse neighs)
9323363 9326324 (Tuco) Haa! Haa!
9655028 9658614 It'll be a lot easier with that.
9697695 9699864 Two can dig a lot quicker than one.
9700490 9702575 Dig.
9704577 9706287 You're not digging.
9718758 9723137 If you shoot me,<br />you won't see a cent of that money.
9724013 9725348 Why?
9728267 9730895 I'll tell you why.
9730978 9733481 Cos there's nothing in there.
9741572 9744825 - Why, you son of a...<br />- You thought I'd trust you?
9748204 9751832 200,000 dollars is a lot of money.
9751916 9755044 We're gonna have to earn it.
9757630 9759924 How?
9769892 9772728 I'll write the name<br />on the bottom of this stone.
9776524 9778651 The gun?
10144516 10148687 You pig! You wanted to get me killed!<br />When did you unload it?
10150689 10152899 Last night.
10152983 10157696 You see, in this world,<br />there's two kinds of people, my friend:
10157779 10162451 those with loaded guns<br />and those who dig.
10162534 10164494 You dig.
10164578 10166705 Where?
10176506 10178884 Here.
10179801 10181678 Unk... Un...
10181762 10184681 There's no name on it.
10184765 10187476 And there's no name here, either.
10188769 10191772 You see, that's what Bill Carson told me.
10191855 10196651 It was the grave marked "unknown",<br />right beside Arch Stanton.
10203450 10205952 Go ahead.
10219591 10222469 (little pants of excitement)
10262717 10266471 Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!
10282445 10287617 You're joking, Blondie. You wouldn't...<br />You wouldn't play a joke on me like that.
10287701 10291037 It's no joke. It's a rope, Tuco.
10291121 10294499 I want you to stand up there<br />and put your head in that noose.
10313435 10315604 (cross creaks)
10361650 10365695 Well, now... Seems just like old times.
10370283 10372994 Four for you.
10374204 10377332 And four...
10378500 10381002 Four for me.
10407028 10408446 Hey, Blon...
10408530 10409864 Blon...
10418998 10421376 Hey, Blondie...
10422627 10425338 Sorry, Tuco.
10428341 10429717 Blondie...
10438852 10441187 Blondie!
10449028 10451197 Blondie!
10460957 10462041 Blondie...
10472677 10474554 Blondie...
10489736 10492405 Blondie!
10513593 10516471 You son of a bitch...
10518806 10521267 Blondie...
10542121 10544499 Aaaarhh!
10580410 10583579 Hey, Blondie!
10584455 10587750 You know what you are?
10590962 10592839 Just a dirty son of a...
10592922 10598177 (melds into theme music)
