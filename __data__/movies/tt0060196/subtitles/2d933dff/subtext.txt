14470 17553 <i>This is Christopher Frayling,<br />the biographer of Sergio Leone,</i>
17640 20473 <i>Taking you through</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
21060 26555 <i>Now when</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly<br /><i>was shot in April to July 1966,</i>
26649 31689 <i>there were in fact over 70 other Italian or<br />Italian-Spanish Westerns being made.</i>
32154 36489 <i>And there was this huge pressure to go<br />one better, and this time Leone went</i>
36576 41116 <i>a lot better because he had a budget of<br />1.3 million dollars,</i>
41205 43742 A Fistful of Dollars<br /><i>had had a budget of 150, 000</i>
43833 45870 <i>and</i> For a Few Dollars More, <i>600, 000.</i>
45960 49749 <i>So he has 1.3 million dollars, half<br />of which was put up by United Artists</i>
49839 53002 <i>and the rest was raised<br />by producer Alberto Grimaldi.</i>
53926 55883 <i>He had three Americans in the leads:</i>
55970 59258 <i>Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef<br />and Eli Wallach.</i>
59348 64764 <i>He had these elaborate credit titles,<br />which are like distressed photographs</i>
64854 68688 <i>of the American Civil War by<br />Alexander Gardner and Mathew Brady,</i>
68774 71983 <i>but colored up in Andy Warhol<br />pop art colors, so you kind of have</i>
72069 75858 <i>a '60s twist on archive photos<br />of the American Civil War.</i>
77116 81110 <i>But there were an awful lot of films<br />in opposition to this going around.</i>
81203 83786 <i>There was an actor who called himself<br />Clint Westwood,</i>
83873 86581 <i>there was a director<br />who called himself John Fordson,</i>
86667 90160 <i>and Leone called it<br />a terrifying gold rush going on in Italy,</i>
90254 93337 <i>with more and more Italian Westerns<br />spewing off the assembly lines,</i>
93424 96382 <i>getting more and more violent,<br />more and more ugly to look at.</i>
96469 100133 <i>He wanted to move out of that league<br />with this movie and make an epic</i>
100222 104307 <i>about the American Civil War which was<br />at the same time an Italian Western.</i>
104560 108303 <i>He brought in some new scriptwriters,<br />Age and Scarpelli,</i>
108397 113517 <i>who were famous for writing farces<br />and slapstick comedies as well as dramas.</i>
113611 116694 <i>He brought in a new director of<br />photography, Tonino Delli Colli,</i>
116781 119364 <i>who was to work with Leone on every film<br />after this</i>
119450 122988 <i>that Leone ever made,<br />taking over from Massimo Dallamano.</i>
123079 126947 <i>Carlo Simi, the great production designer<br />who was responsible for both the sets</i>
127041 128998 <i>and the costumes on this film,</i>
129085 131167 <i>because they were all<br />very much of a piece.</i>
131253 134996 <i>And the music by Ennio Morricone<br />was the most elaborate yet,</i>
135091 139631 <i>with each of the main characters<br />having a version of the main title theme.</i>
139720 143679 <i>So you have a soprano flute for<br />Clint Eastwood, the Good.</i>
143766 146303 <i>You have an arghilophone,<br />which is a ceramic instrument</i>
146394 148635 <i>with holes in it, for Lee Van Cleef,</i>
148729 152017 <i>and you have a screaming choir<br />for Eli Wallach.</i>
152108 154190 <i>And so they take up<br />these three different instruments</i>
154276 157564 <i>with the main title theme<br />that then builds up with bugles</i>
157655 162240 <i>and electric guitars and drums and strings<br />into this kind of</i>
162326 163782 <i>old-fashioned Italian Western theme</i>
163869 167078 <i>that slowly moves into<br />an epic soundtrack theme.</i>
169542 173456 <i>Luigi Lardani did the titles as he had<br />for Leone's other films</i>
173546 177414 <i>and it finishes with a joke<br />of Sergio Leone's name</i>
177508 180000 <i>being made as a canon fires at a horse.</i>
182012 183156 <i>And according to the shooting script</i>
183180 186343 <i>we're in a village on the borders of Texas<br />and New Mexico.</i>
186475 189843 <i>And a face belonging to<br />the Canadian actor Al Mulock</i>
189937 191894 <i>blocks the landscape,<br />and throughout this movie,</i>
191981 195099 <i>the landscapes are either too full<br />or too empty.</i>
195192 200562 <i>Huge vistas of the Spanish landscape<br />or faces blocking the way.</i>
200656 204399 <i>"In this shooting script it says, " This<br />face blocks the view of a ghost town</i>
204493 206575 <i>"in the middle of nowhere, a coyote howls,"</i>
206662 210451 <i>"the wind whistles, the doors crash,<br />canvas rustles."</i>
210541 213078 <i>And you have all these natural sounds<br />rather like the opening</i>
213169 215206 <i>of</i> Once Upon a Time in the West.
215296 217788 <i>And what it looks like is<br />there's going to be some showdown.</i>
217882 222718 <i>Two bad guys come from one end of town<br />and one bad guy appears at the other end.</i>
222803 225670 <i>And what we think is<br />there's about to be a face-off</i>
227224 230558 <i>Carlo Simi, the production designer,<br />was asked to find a plateau</i>
230644 232760 <i>in the highlands of Almería,<br />where there'd be</i>
232855 236689 <i>these marvelous vistas in all directions.<br />So you got the sense of a ghost town</i>
236776 240440 <i>that really was in the middle of nowhere,<br />made of old wood,</i>
240529 243692 <i>as if it had been inhabited<br />and then people had moved on.</i>
243866 247575 <i>And he rather overdid it because<br />he chose a very, very remote location</i>
247661 252121 <i>and several cars overturned on the track<br />up to this piece of highlands,</i>
252208 254620 <i>and Leone was absolutely furious<br />with Carlo Simi</i>
254710 256917 <i>for choosing something that was<br />so out of the way,</i>
257004 259587 <i>so inaccessible and so difficult to get to.</i>
259673 261960 <i>But when Leone walked,<br />and he didn't walk very often,</i>
262051 264668 <i>but when he walked with Carlo Simi<br />to this spot, he got there,</i>
264762 267129 <i>and he saw the buildings<br />and the clanking doors</i>
267223 269806 <i>and the canvas of the wagon rustling<br />and he said,</i>
269892 272930 <i>"Have you bought me to this...<br />My God, it's wonderful."</i>
273062 276180 <i>And then the crew with all the coaches<br />and all the paraphernalia of the crew</i>
276273 279436 <i>arrived in this plateau,<br />this windswept plateau</i>
279527 280983 <i>in the highlands of Almería.</i>
281070 284813 <i>All for this effect of a ghost town<br />in the first sequence of the film.</i>
284907 287239 <i>This is Leone moving into<br />a different production league</i>
287326 290409 <i>to the other movies,<br />a different league altogether.</i>
291455 293617 <i>So they're walking down<br />the main street together,</i>
293707 296495 <i>the scrunch of boots,<br />that Leone sound effect.</i>
296585 299953 <i>In fact in the shooting script, it said,<br />"There will be musical effects</i>"
300047 301208 <i>"to underline the tension."</i>
301298 304791 <i>But they obviously decided to go for<br />choreographing natural sounds</i>
304885 307923 <i>as a piece of sound design<br />on the soundtrack instead.</i>
308013 312132 <i>And the whole thing about Italian movies<br />is that everything is post-synchronized.</i>
312226 315685 <i>There's no direct sound, so by the time<br />you've shot the movie</i>
315771 319514 <i>that's just the beginning of<br />laying all these soundtrack effects.</i>
319608 323476 <i>And as Leone said, the sound is<br />at least 40% of the movie,</i>
323571 325549 <i>and this opening sequence of</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
325573 326938 <i>is a good example.</i>
329660 332027 <i>Al Mulock was to appear<br />in the opening sequence</i>
332121 333862 <i>of</i> Once Upon a Time in the West <i>as well,</i>
333956 336493 <i>as a memory of</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
336584 340043 <i>So they're not shooting each other.<br />They're all three after the same guy.</i>
340129 341585 <i>Into the saloon.</i>
343173 346131 <i>And out of the window,<br />with a piece of meat in one hand</i>
346218 350462 <i>and a bottle in the other,<br />our introduction to Eli Wallach as Tuco.</i>
351265 356977 <i>Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramirez.</i>
357062 359457 <i>His name's Pacifico, but there's not<br />much peaceful about him,</i>
359481 360971 <i>this Mexican bandit.</i>
366488 368320 <i>Leone cast Eli Wallach not as people think</i>
368407 372992 <i>after seeing him as Calvera,<br />the bad guy in</i> The Magnificent Seven,
373078 377868 <i>but after seeing him as the bad guy<br />Charlie Gant in</i> How the West Was Won,
377958 381576 <i>in the railroad sequence<br />of that Cinerama epic</i>
381670 385413 <i>where Charlie Gant plays the last<br />of the bad guys who robs trains.</i>
385507 388716 <i>And there's a moment at a railroad<br />where Gant mimes</i>
388802 392215 <i>the shooting of two pistols<br />at George Peppard's children,</i>
392306 394718 <i>and they flinch at this moment of mime.</i>
394808 397391 <i>And Leone saw that, he said,<br />"At that moment I knew</i>
397478 400436 <i>"that Eli Wallach would be a great clown.<br />And even though he worked"</i>
400522 404356 <i>"at the Actors Studio, which is not<br />the kind of acting that I like very much,"</i>
404443 407686 <i>"I'm sure he's going to be<br />the right guy for this."</i>
407780 410272 <i>And as Eli Wallach said<br />when he smashed through that window,</i>
410366 414451 <i>little did he know that A, he'd be spending<br />the next 10 years working in Italy,</i>
414536 418370 <i>but B, it would change his life.<br />It was the performance of his career.</i>
419375 423915 <i>And then we cut to a farm in Almería<br />near San José</i>
424004 426917 <i>and the arrival of the second protagonist<br />of the movie,</i>
427007 429374 <i>Lee Van Cleef, as the Bad.</i>
429468 431630 <i>Notice his high-stepping Andalucían horse.</i>
431720 435258 <i>Lee Van Cleef had had a very bad<br />car accident in 1958 in Beverly Hills</i>
435349 437306 <i>which smashed his left kneecap,</i>
437393 440226 <i>and he walked with a limp and he<br />sometimes had to use a step ladder</i>
440312 441802 <i>to get on and off a horse.</i>
441897 445231 <i>So they had very highly trained<br />circus horses for him to ride.</i>
445317 448275 <i>Yet, it's one of the distinctive features<br />of Van Cleef in these movies.</i>
448362 453323 <i>You get these high-kicking horses,<br />it was so he'd be comfortable on them.</i>
453409 456697 <i>But he's a younger man than the character<br />he played in</i> For a Few Dollars More.
456787 462123 <i>Colonel Mortimer is an old, romantic,<br />end-of-the-line kind of character.</i>
462209 465201 <i>Lee Van Cleef in this<br />film is a lot younger.</i>
465295 469755 <i>His makeup is intended to make him look<br />at least 10 years younger than the Colonel.</i>
470134 474173 <i>And in the shooting script,<br />Lee Van Cleef's name was Banjo,</i>
474263 477472 <i>which is a slightly odd choice.<br />But while they were filming it,</i>
477558 481768 <i>his name was Sentenza,<br />meaning judgment or sentence.</i>
481854 485063 <i>And if you look closely at the Italian<br />actors' lips when they're talking to him,</i>
485149 489063 <i>They say the word Sentenza throughout.<br />But for the American version</i>
489153 491064 <i>they changed it to Angel Eyes.</i>
491155 494147 <i>And this wonderful idea of the irony<br />of calling</i>
494241 496357 <i>the man with the gun-sight eyes<br />Angel Eyes</i>
496452 498034 <i>actually came from Clint Eastwood.</i>
498120 501283 <i>It wasn't in the script,<br />it was made up on the set.</i>
501373 504081 <i>And so everyone calls Lee Van Cleef<br />Angel Eyes.</i>
506754 509872 <i>The farmer who lives<br />in this palatial farmhouse,</i>
509965 511501 <i>called Stevens in the film,</i>
511592 515677 <i>was played by the Spanish character actor<br />Antonio Casas.</i>
515763 518972 <i>And his wife, by the Cuban actress<br />Chelo Alonso,</i>
519058 521846 <i>who had in fact appeared<br />in a lot of sword and sandal epics</i>
521935 523892 <i>after working at the Folies Bergère<br />in Paris.</i>
523979 527563 <i>She started off as a dancer and her career<br />was beginning to go into decline.</i>
527649 532359 <i>And she plays the nonspeaking role<br />of Stevens' wife in this sequence.</i>
532446 536314 <i>And Stevens' youngest son is played by<br />the same little boy as played</i>
536408 540072 <i>the young child in</i> For a Few Dollars More,<br /><i>who sits under the boardwalk</i>
540162 543780 <i>and watches Lee Van Cleef and<br />Clint Eastwood go through their paces.</i>
543874 545990 <i>So he was already a Leone veteran.</i>
548128 551086 <i>Stevens is sitting down to a meal,<br />and Lee Van Cleef</i>
551173 553961 <i>used to tell a great story about<br />the shooting of this sequence,</i>
554051 557214 <i>that Leone's command of English<br />had got better but it wasn't that good.</i>
557304 562299 <i>I mean, mainly he knew the phrase,<br />"Watch me" or "Very hat, Clint, very hat,"</i>
562392 564099 <i>or "Watch me, Clint. Watch me, Lee."</i>
564186 567599 <i>And on this occasion they were walking<br />through this sequence</i>
567689 570977 <i>and Leone said to Lee Van Cleef,</i>
571068 572604 <i>"Eat the minister, eat the minister."</i>
572694 575799 <i>He thought, "I knew this was a strange<br />film, but I'm supposed to eat the priest?"</i>
575823 577939 <i>He meant, "Eat the soup, minestrone."</i>
578033 581196 "Ministeri, <i>sit down and eat the soup."</i>
581286 583493 <i>So Leone had a strange way<br />of communicating,</i>
583580 586538 <i>but it seemed to work because<br />I think Lee Van Cleef's performance</i>
586625 590289 <i>in this sequence is the best thing he did<br />in this film.</i>
590379 592120 <i>It is so sinister.</i>
593173 598509 <i>He moves very slowly, his eyes absolutely<br />riveted on his prey.</i>
600013 602471 <i>He smiles in the most sinister way</i>
602558 606267 <i>and a little bit later on in the sequence<br />he says the phrase, "Nice family,"</i>
606353 608094 <i>in the most sinister way you can imagine.</i>
608188 610680 <i>I think this is Lee Van Cleef at his best.</i>
611108 613975 <i>Always great emphasis on eating<br />in Leone's films.</i>
614528 616565 <i>The details of eating,</i>
617906 620113 <i>bits of food stuck around people's lips.</i>
620200 622316 <i>This was something of a specialty.</i>
625205 629199 <i>We're about to have the first reference<br />to the American Civil War in this,</i>
629293 631705 <i>after this long, long moment of silence.</i>
632171 634065 <i>Because the whole thing about</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
634089 638834 <i>was that it was set in a real historical<br />setting for the first time in a Leone film.</i>
638927 643546 <i>And it's set at a very particular time,<br />we're in the autumn of 1861</i>
643932 648142 <i>and General Sibley is about to move<br />from Texas to New Mexico</i>
648228 651141 <i>and bring his Confederate forces<br />into New Mexico</i>
651231 653689 <i>for the great invasion of New Mexico.</i>
654109 655770 <i>And he moved deep into New Mexico</i>
655861 658148 <i>until the spring and summer of 1862</i>
658238 662152 <i>when he was repulsed<br />at Glorieta and other places.</i>
662242 664904 <i>And this is the background,<br />we've got the Confederates arriving,</i>
664995 667862 <i>we've the Confederates retreating,<br />and the mayhem that's created</i>
667956 672541 <i>on both sides as the background<br />to this film. They are in a battle zone.</i>
673045 677380 <i>And this complicated story<br />that we're hearing from Stevens</i>
677466 681630 <i>about a cash box, a Confederate cash box<br />that's gone missing,</i>
681720 683280 <i>and the three people who know about it,</i>
683305 685797 <i>which is a kind of detective story element<br />in the film,</i>
685891 688679 <i>is the first reference<br />to the American Civil War.</i>
688936 690426 Name of Jackson.
690520 692290 <i>And a lot of people said to Leone<br />when he was making it,</i>
692314 695056 <i>"Look, the American Civil War was mainly<br />east of the Mississippi."</i>
695150 699736 <i>I mean, most movies about the<br />Civil War are set in the east of America.</i>
699822 704783 <i>There wasn't a proper Civil War in Texas.<br />Yes, there are movies about gun running,</i>
704869 707201 <i>and horse stealing and espionage</i>
707288 710201 <i>and escaped convicts<br />in Texas and New Mexico,</i>
710291 714034 <i>but a pitched battle in Texas<br />in the American Civil War?</i>
714128 716335 <i>Well, Leone went off<br />to the Library of Congress</i>
716422 720461 <i>and got a whole series of books out<br />to try and prove to the nay-sayers</i>
720551 723669 <i>that this in fact had happened.<br />And he found a whole series of books</i>
723763 729429 <i>on a pitched battle that took place<br />at Glorieta in 1862 in Texas.</i>
729519 731305 <i>And he got the story that he wanted.</i>
736693 739060 Why do you think Jackson may be<br />assuming another name?
739153 742066 <i>The name<br />that Jackson's hiding under now,</i>
742156 745865 <i>which becomes Bill Carson,<br />in the original shooting script,</i>
745952 748489 <i>interestingly is Kid Russell,</i>
748579 753073 <i>and Kid Russell was the name<br />of a famous painter of the Wild West,</i>
753167 757502 <i>Charles B. Russell from Montana, and<br />obviously the scriptwriters originally</i>
757588 760388 <i>thought of any American name they<br />could think of from the history books</i>
760425 764384 <i>and put in Kid Russell, and it was<br />subsequently changed to Bill Carson.</i>
770518 771724 Yes.
772478 773478 Nice family.
773563 777682 <i>"Nice Family." Only Lee Van Cleef can say<br />it in quite that sinister a way.</i>
777775 780813 <i>He of course had played bad guys in<br />Hollywood Westerns</i>
780903 784112 <i>way back to</i> High Noon<br /><i>at the beginning of the 1950s,</i>
784198 788237 <i>where he played Jack Colby<br />and had hoped to play a bigger part</i>
788328 790569 <i>but ended up as one of<br />the three gunslingers</i>
790663 792745 <i>waiting at Hadleyville Station.</i>
792832 797952 <i>And what he brought with him to Italy<br />was that memory of all those bad guys</i>
798046 799628 <i>that he had played in Hollywood.</i>
799714 802581 <i>His career had taken a downturn<br />in Hollywood in the early '60s,</i>
802675 804236 <i>partly because of his road accident<br />and partly</i>
804260 807594 <i>because he just wasn't getting the parts<br />except on television,</i>
807680 811719 <i>and the Italians came to his rescue.<br />And using Lee Van Cleef's physiognomy</i>
811809 815473 <i>in this way, as if<br />it's an old master painting,</i>
815563 818146 <i>was Leone saying,<br />"I loved all those Hollywood movies,"</i>
818232 820849 <i>and they're all distilled<br />into Lee Van Cleef's performance.</i>
820943 824026 <i>But he was never more<br />sinister than he is in this film.</i>
826449 831159 <i>We've seen the caption for the Ugly,<br />which was the arrival of Eli Wallach,</i>
831245 834328 <i>and in the next sequence<br />we'll see the caption for the Bad,</i>
834415 836531 <i>who is of course Lee Van Cleef</i>
836626 838645 <i>In the American publicity for the film<br />and the trailer,</i>
838669 841787 <i>they got them the wrong way around<br />and called Eli Wallach the Bad,</i>
841881 843212 <i>and Lee Van Cleef the Ugly.</i>
843299 845256 <i>So in subsequent films that he made<br />after this</i>
845343 848210 <i>which were released in the States<br />after 1968,</i>
848304 851171 <i>he kept having taglines like<br />"Mr. Ugly comes to town,"</i>
851265 852745 <i>which is completely incomprehensible.</i>
852809 855141 <i>This guy is the Bad, he's not the Ugly.</i>
855228 856935 <i>Eli Wallach is the Ugly.</i>
857772 859792 <i>Eat the minister.<br />He's continuing to eat the minister</i>
859816 861147 <i>as he goes through this sequence.</i>
861651 863062 I always see the job through.
874163 877246 <i>These strange hysterical strings<br />that you get at this point</i>
877333 879916 <i>recurs two or three other times<br />during the movie</i>
880002 881743 <i>at moments of extreme violence,</i>
881838 887208 <i>later on when Lee Van Cleef<br />beats up a prostitute catted Maria,</i>
887301 889713 <i>and later still in the Civil War sequence.</i>
889804 893547 <i>It's reserved by Morricone<br />for moments of extreme tension.</i>
896936 900679 <i>In a Hollywood movie the bad guy<br />does not shoot the entire family,</i>
901691 905059 <i>but in this movie he shoots the child<br />as well as the father.</i>
905862 909025 <i>Rather like the Henry Fonda character<br />in</i> Once Upon a Time in the West,
910116 912469 <i>you can tell a bad guy<br />'cause he's a really, really bad guy.</i>
912493 918614 <i>First visual reference to the Civil War,<br />a Confederate uniform, as Sentenza</i>
918708 923874 <i>or Angel Eyes goes back to Baker<br />to report what he's been up to.</i>
927884 933095 <i>Baker is played by a veteran Spanish<br />actor called Livio Lorenzon,</i>
935057 939676 <i>and it's interesting 'cause he'd appeared<br />in a movie called</i> La Grande guerra,
939770 942683 The Great War, <i>which was made in 1959,</i>
942773 946482 <i>which was written by Luciano Vincenzoni<br />and Age and Scarpelli,</i>
946569 949561 <i>the two scriptwriters of</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
949655 953319 <i>And it was all about two rogues who get<br />drawn into the First World War,</i>
953409 956151 <i>one from Milan,<br />played by Vittorio Gassman,</i>
956245 959237 <i>and one from Rome,<br />played by Alberto Sordi.</i>
959332 961323 <i>And their adventures<br />get increasingly dark.</i>
961417 964910 <i>They start off as two rogues trying to<br />con each other in the First World War</i>
965004 967837 <i>and then there's a pitched battle<br />and they see the slaughter,</i>
967924 973010 <i>they see the wounded being picked up in<br />between, up and over from the trenches,</i>
973095 976679 <i>they try and set up a telegraph line<br />in the middle of a pitched battle</i>
976766 979007 <i>but only manage to link themselves<br />up with the Germans</i>
979101 980933 <i>because it's the Italians<br />against the Germans,</i>
981020 984684 <i>and they both end up getting shot<br />by a firing squad in the last sequence.</i>
984774 987937 <i>And the man playing Baker<br />played a large part in the</i> Grande guerra,
988027 991361 <i>which audiences would have remembered,<br />and there are strong resemblances</i>
991447 993984 <i>between</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly<br /><i>and the</i> Grande guerra.
994075 996988 <i>Instead of it being the First World War,<br />it's the American Civil War,</i>
997078 1000366 <i>but the whole concept of putting<br />two con men in the situation</i>
1000456 1004575 <i>of a real-life historical carnage with all<br />the mayhem going on around them</i>
1004669 1009038 <i>which emphasizes the absurdity of the<br />war is very much the scriptwriter's idea</i>
1009131 1012715 <i>of Vincenzoni, which he brought to</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
1013928 1019389 But you know the pity is, when I'm paid,<br />I always follow my job through.
1019475 1022763 -You know that.<br />-No! Angel Eyes...
1022853 1025561 <i>The idea of shooting someone<br />through the pillow</i>
1025731 1028348 <i>probably came from the Tourneur film,</i>
1028442 1032811 a Great Day in the Morning <i>made in the<br />mid-1950s about the American Civil War,</i>
1032905 1037900 <i>Hollywood movie with Robert Stack.<br />It was a favorite Leone movie.</i>
1040121 1044285 <i>And here we have the second caption<br />in case you had any doubts</i>
1044375 1046958 <i>as to which of the<br />title characters this is.</i>
1048170 1052164 <i>The original Italian title, well, the original<br />Italian title was</i> Two Magnificent Rogues
1053050 1054961 <i>or</i> Two Magnificent Tramps,
1055052 1058044 <i>and that was the title under which<br />it was sold to United Artists.</i>
1058139 1060551 <i>But then it became</i><br />Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo.
1060641 1062848 The Good, the Ugly and the Bad,
1062935 1064935 <i>and it was thought when translating it<br />into English</i>
1065021 1068480 <i>that it alliterated better<br />as</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
1071819 1073981 <i>This is the countryside north of Madrid,</i>
1074071 1078781 <i>rather near where</i> Fistful of Dollars <i>was<br />shot for Eli Wallach's second entrance.</i>
1079410 1083995 <i>Three bounty hunters are trying to<br />bring him in for his reward</i>
1084081 1089167 <i>and we're about to be introduced to the<br />Good in the most iconic way imaginable.</i>
1090546 1095507 You know you've got a face<br />beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?
1097720 1099176 [NEW VOICE] Yeah.
1101724 1104466 <i>So, where's he come from?<br />He's suddenly appeared like a ghost.</i>
1104560 1107348 <i>It's a great cinematic moment.<br />We don't see him, we hear him.</i>
1107438 1109850 <i>We see the back of his head,<br />we see his hat,</i>
1109940 1112352 <i>we see the match, we see the cigarillo,</i>
1112443 1114683 <i>we see a part of his coat<br />and we see the growth of beard,</i>
1114737 1116978 <i>that's all we need to know about him.</i>
1117531 1119738 <i>Down with the camera to his gun hand.</i>
1119825 1124035 <i>It is the most iconic entrance<br />in '60s movies.</i>
1124121 1126328 <i>The whole memory<br />of the last two Leone films is there,</i>
1126415 1129658 <i>except he's not wearing his poncho<br />this time or his sheepskin waistcoat.</i>
1129752 1133586 <i>He's wearing a rather natty frockcoat<br />and a different kind of hat.</i>
1133673 1135914 <i>But there's no doubting<br />this is Clint Eastwood</i>
1136008 1138340 <i>who in the script is called Joe throughout.</i>
1138427 1140885 <i>Not the Man with No Name, but Joe.</i>
1140971 1143133 <i>This is Joe, the bounty hunter,</i>
1143224 1146091 <i>wearing his gun belt from</i> Rawhide,<br /><i>a glimpse there.</i>
1157113 1161323 <i>Now, Eli Wallach accepted the part of Tuco</i>
1161409 1163992 <i>after watching the credit titles<br />of</i> For a Few Dollars More
1164078 1165568 <i>which amused him mightily,</i>
1165663 1168530 <i>with people having target practice<br />with all the names.</i>
1168624 1172333 <i>And when Clint Eastwood<br />was offered the part of Joe,</i>
1172420 1176334 <i>he hesitated for a while because he could<br />see that the part of Tuco</i>
1176424 1180634 <i>was a large part and in fact<br />was likely to dominate the film,</i>
1180720 1183052 <i>and that whereas in the first movie<br />he was by himself</i>
1183139 1185551 <i>and in the second movie<br />he played opposite Lee Van Cleef,</i>
1185641 1187678 <i>in this one there were three of them.</i>
1187768 1189384 <i>And slowly he was being edged out,</i>
1189478 1192266 <i>the landscape was important,<br />the design of the film was important,</i>
1192356 1194347 <i>the epic sweep of this film was important,</i>
1194442 1197025 <i>but the character of<br />the Man with No Name, or Joe,</i>
1197111 1200149 <i>was becoming diminishingly important,</i>
1200239 1202230 <i>but he accepted in the end.</i>
1202324 1205612 <i>But the relationship between Tuco<br />and Eastwood is really interesting.</i>
1205703 1209742 <i>Tuco is incredibly vocal, obviously<br />improvising like mad a lot of the time,</i>
1209832 1211823 <i>whereas Eastwood is very, very silent,</i>
1211917 1214477 <i>building up to the moment at the end<br />of the film where he becomes</i>
1214503 1217586 <i>the Man with No Name<br />from</i> A Fistful of Dollars.
1217673 1220791 <i>He's preparing himself,<br />as it were, to go in a circle.</i>
1221469 1226259 <i>This set was at Elios Studios in Rome<br />and was one of the first sequences</i>
1226348 1230387 <i>to be filmed before they went<br />to Southern Spain and to Madrid.</i>
1230936 1235225 <i>The set was built in 1964<br />for another Italian Western.</i>
1235316 1241312 <i>It was just off the Via Tiburtina in Rome,<br />and the studio had been founded in 1962.</i>
1241405 1245569 <i>One of the most recent movies<br />to be shot here was Corbucci's</i> Django,
1245659 1248276 <i>where the entire main street<br />was a sea of mud,</i>
1248370 1249681 <i>and it looks as though<br />they haven't actually</i>
1249705 1251537 <i>changed the main street since</i> Django.
1251624 1253991 <i>It remains a sea of mud.</i>
1257254 1260622 Who the hell is that?<br />One bastard goes in, another comes out.
1260716 1262276 <i>None of this was in the shooting script</i>
1262301 1264167 <i>and part of it seems<br />to have been improvised,</i>
1264261 1266172 <i>part of it written at the last minute.</i>
1266263 1270052 <i>The elaborate curses<br />that Tuco shouts all the time,</i>
1270142 1274101 <i>the "One bastard goes in<br />two bastards come out,"</i>
1274188 1277647 <i>these incredibly convoluted phrases<br />that he has,</i>
1277733 1279189 <i>a lot of this was improvised.</i>
1279276 1282985 <i>Wallach remembers that the fact that he<br />wears a belt and braces</i>
1283072 1285484 <i>was improvised 'cause he noticed<br />that Leone did that.</i>
1285574 1289158 <i>The man didn't even trust his own<br />trousers, so Tuco was the same.</i>
1289245 1291532 <i>The chaps that he's wearing,<br />which don't seem to be</i>
1291622 1294535 <i>for their traditional purpose<br />but are a sort of style statement,</i>
1294625 1296832 <i>a Hispanic style statement, he found</i>
1296919 1299581 <i>in Western Costume in Hollywood<br />before he arrived.</i>
1299672 1302359 <i>The strange way in which he crosses<br />himself, where he crosses himself</i>
1302383 1304294 <i>and wipes his nose at the same time.</i>
1304385 1307173 <i>He doesn't quite believe in the Almighty<br />but you never know.</i>
1307263 1309971 <i>Maybe, maybe for superstitious reasons<br />he ought to do that.</i>
1310057 1313345 <i>All of that was improvised on the set.</i>
1313435 1317429 <i>And Leone responded by putting in<br />various improvised effects as well.</i>
1317523 1319935 <i>But these elaborate curses<br />in fact got to the point</i>
1320025 1322425 <i>where on the shooting script<br />it simply says,</i> "Insulti, <i>Tuco."</i>
1324280 1328444 <i>That's all you need to say and<br />leave Eli Wallach to do the rest.</i>
1328534 1331196 <i>And here's the first of the scams where,</i>
1331287 1334780 <i>and it might have come from the<br />W.C. Fields movie</i> My Little Chickadee
1334874 1336581 <i>where there's a similar idea,</i>
1336667 1340376 <i>where Tuco is turned in<br />to be hanged in a village.</i>
1340462 1343295 <i>Here's a list of his crimes,<br />so he's been incredibly busy,</i>
1343382 1347421 <i>and you get these wonderful<br />social comments on the town</i>
1347511 1352130 <i>from these faces that Leone pans along<br />who are watching this public execution.</i>
1352474 1355557 <i>But this is going to be a public execution<br />with a difference,</i>
1355644 1357760 <i>because standing in a barn<br />overlooking this</i>
1357855 1361849 <i>is the guardian angel in the form<br />of Clint Eastwood.</i>
1361942 1364400 <i>Again you don't have to see him,<br />you just see a puff of smoke</i>
1364486 1366477 <i>and his theme from the soundtrack.</i>
1369033 1372867 Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramirez...
1372995 1374156 Known as "The Rat."
1374246 1378661 <i>In the shooting script it says,</i><br />"Detto il porco," <i>"known as the pig."</i>
1378751 1382995 <i>He changed from being a pig to a rat during<br />the course of the movie being made.</i>
1385883 1390423 <i>And Wallach remembers<br />that he tried to encourage Leone</i>
1390512 1393675 <i>to put cotton wool buds<br />in the ears of the horse,</i>
1393766 1396077 <i>which was quite common practice<br />when making Hollywood Westerns,</i>
1396101 1398934 <i>because there was<br />a little charge of dynamite inside the rope</i>
1399021 1401809 <i>that exploded<br />in order for the rope to break,</i>
1401899 1404106 <i>and he was worried<br />that the horse might be spooked.</i>
1404193 1405295 <i>"And Leone said, " Don't be so silly.</i>
1405319 1407047 <i>"Putting cotton wool buds<br />in the ears of horses?"</i>
1407071 1408924 <i>"I never heard of anything<br />so stupid in my life."</i>
1408948 1411781 <i>So he didn't and the result was<br />that when the rope exploded,</i>
1411867 1416612 <i>the horse bolted, and it was all Wallach<br />could do to hold on. So he was right.</i>
1417039 1419781 <i>In this sequence<br />where they're sharing the spoils,</i>
1419875 1423914 <i>"the scriptwriter Luciano Vincenzoni<br />said, "Look, what I wrote was,</i>
1424004 1427247 <i>"'Four for you. Four for me. '<br />And sharing the spoils."</i>
1427341 1431960 <i>And it would simply be<br />in a landscape of New Mexico.</i>
1433722 1437807 <i>But Leone spent a long, long time<br />finding this location</i>
1437893 1441136 <i>with the overhanging rock<br />and the ramblers in the background</i>
1441230 1443221 <i>and the mountains,<br />which completely transforms</i>
1443315 1445898 <i>the scale of the sequence.<br />And Vincenzoni couldn't believe it</i>
1445985 1449319 <i>when he saw it at the premiere,<br />that the sense of scale,</i>
1449405 1452050 <i>that the choice of location<br />the production design had brought to it,</i>
1452074 1454406 <i>completely transformed the dialog.</i>
1454493 1457472 <i>It's also a very famous moment. "There<br />are two kinds of people in this world,"</i>
1457496 1461956 <i>the first time this phrase comes up.<br />On the shooting script it translates as,</i>
1462042 1465251 <i>"The world is divided<br />into two categories, Joe."</i>
1465337 1469205 <i>But in translating it,<br />translating the original Italian dialog,</i>
1469299 1472132 <i>Mickey Knox, who prepared<br />the American version</i>
1472219 1475428 <i>brought up this phrase, "There are<br />two kinds of people in this world,"</i>
1475514 1478381 <i>which would recur<br />at the end of this movie as well.</i>
1478726 1480137 Nothing.
1483897 1485433 "Wanted in 15 counties of this state."
1485524 1486918 <i>Now, this is a more prosperous town</i>
1486942 1490901 <i>for the second scam<br />between Tuco and Blondie</i>
1490988 1495528 <i>and in the script it's called Valverde,<br />this place, which is historic,</i>
1495617 1499030 <i>a place associated<br />with Sibley's invasion of New Mexico.</i>
1499121 1504457 <i>Obviously more up-market,<br />with lots of Euro faces living there.</i>
1504543 1506580 <i>It's obviously a more middle-class town.</i>
1506670 1510208 <i>And Eli Wallach reminisces<br />that while he was sitting there</i>
1510299 1513792 <i>with the rope around his neck in this set<br />which is a part of Carlo Simi's set</i>
1513886 1517299 <i>from</i> For a Few Dollars More, <i>the El Paso<br />set from</i> For a Few Dollars More,
1517389 1519617 <i>"he thought to himself, " What am I doing<br />sitting on a horse</i>
1519641 1522850 <i>"in the middle of the Spanish desert when<br />I could be doing Chekov on the stage?"</i>
1522936 1525724 <i>And he went, "Grr!" in that way<br />as an improvisation.</i>
1525814 1527976 <i>Leone loved it and kept it in.</i>
1528776 1532986 <i>But the Bad, Sentenza,<br />Angel Eyes, is in the same town</i>
1533072 1535404 <i>and he's talking to this half-soldier.</i>
1535491 1539155 <i>Originally there was much more dialog<br />between the two of them.</i>
1539244 1543784 <i>But the script ghost doctor,<br />a man called Sergio Donati,</i>
1543874 1546161 <i>who doesn't appear on the credits,<br />rewrote the dialog</i>
1546251 1549744 <i>for this part of the movie<br />in order to explain some bits</i>
1549838 1551954 <i>that are subsequently being cut.</i>
1552049 1553881 <i>It has a rather sick joke in a moment.</i>
1553967 1557255 <i>This is the first<br />of the mutilated characters.</i>
1557346 1559963 <i>There's a Confederate with no legs,</i>
1560057 1561798 <i>there's a Union soldier<br />with an arm missing,</i>
1561892 1563732 <i>there're all sorts of people<br />who're dismembered</i>
1563811 1566553 <i>and bodies lying everywhere<br />in this field of battle</i>
1566647 1571107 <i>and this is the first reference<br />to the mayhem that war causes.</i>
1571193 1574106 <i>But as he goes into the bar<br />the character says, you know,</i>
1574196 1577359 <i>"If you find Carson,<br />I wouldn't like to be in his shoes."</i>
1578033 1581401 <i>Which I'm afraid is a bit of a bad joke.</i>
1582412 1586952 <i>Watch the way Lee Van Cleef walks<br />in this very stiff, emphatic way</i>
1587042 1589079 <i>following his accident in 1958.</i>
1589294 1590784 <i>You don't see him walking very often.</i>
1590879 1594622 Glad they got him...<br />A man guilty of all those crimes.

1616905 1619488 <i>but everyone calls him Blondie<br />throughout the film</i>
1619575 1622067 <i>because to Italians he seems fairly blond.</i>
1622452 1625056 <i>There's a moment later on in this film<br />where they reach a monastery</i>
1625080 1628914 <i>and the Angelus is playing on the bells<br />as Clint Eastwood arrives.</i>
1629001 1630162 <i>That's the angel.</i>
1630252 1632744 <i>This time the rope doesn't break so easily.</i>
1632838 1634816 <i>And they had a discussion<br />about whether Eli Wallach</i>
1634840 1637457 <i>should use a stuntman<br />for this next moment.</i>
1638385 1640672 <i>In fact, you'll see Clint Eastwood<br />on his horse</i>
1640762 1643925 <i>but Eli Wallach is an Italian stuntman<br />chasing him,</i>
1644016 1647304 <i>where the gag is that Tuco<br />is running faster than the horse.</i>
1648812 1652100 <i>But Eastwood's on the horse,<br />the stuntman's in front of him.</i>
1659031 1662649 <i>So they've left Valverde<br />and now they are in the desert.</i>
1663243 1666452 <i>The desert of Almería,<br />the scrublands of Almería.</i>
1666538 1668779 <i>And this strange use of landscape...</i>
1668874 1671707 <i>There aren't many people who can make<br />the landscape of the Wild West</i>
1671793 1673753 <i>look sinister,<br />but Leone is certainly one of them.</i>
1674755 1677543 <i>Usually it looks<br />archaic or naturally beautiful</i>
1677633 1679419 <i>or national park-y,</i>
1679509 1683878 <i>but by having either the landscape too full<br />or too empty,</i>
1683972 1687761 <i>Leone creates the idea that it's a very<br />dangerous place to go through.</i>
1687851 1690593 <i>He has a kind of urban sensibility<br />where the landscape's concerned.</i>
1690687 1693224 <i>This is a place<br />you go through at your peril.</i>
1693315 1695932 <i>And in the middle of the desert<br />are these two characters</i>
1696026 1697391 <i>like dots in the landscape.</i>
1697486 1699397 <i>But you know that they're very sinister.</i>
1699488 1702355 <i>They walk through the landscape<br />as if it was a block of flats in Rome.</i>
1702449 1706033 <i>They don't walk through the landscape<br />as if it was the Wild West.</i>
1707579 1709240 What do you mean?
1709915 1712247 I mean, our partnership is untied.
1715629 1717870 <i>Note that Tuco's wearing<br />his belt and braces</i>
1717965 1720002 <i>like the director Sergio Leone.</i>
1720842 1723300 You filthy, double-crossing bastard!
1723387 1725378 Of all the stinking, dirty tricks...
1725472 1729966 <i>One of the aspects of Tuco's cussing<br />and swearing,</i> "Insulti, <i>Tuco,"</i>
1730060 1733678 <i>was taken from the Robert Aldrich film</i><br />Vera Cruz,
1733939 1736522 <i>where Burt Lancaster keeps saying,<br />"You dirty son of a..."</i>
1736608 1737894 <i>And you never hear the last word</i>
1737985 1740272 <i>because there's a fanfare of trumpets<br />from somewhere</i>
1740362 1743320 <i>that blots out the last word.<br />It's a running gag in the movie</i>
1743407 1745635 <i>and this comes into</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <i>as well.</i>
1745659 1747866 Vera Cruz <i>was a favorite Leone film.</i>
1747953 1751947 <i>So the way Tuco's insults get more<br />and more convoluted</i>
1752040 1755874 <i>and sometimes segue into<br />shrieking choirs on the soundtrack</i>
1756420 1758161 <i>came from that film.</i>
1758255 1763000 <i>And here's the title of the third<br />of the iconic characters, the Good.</i>
1763093 1766711 <i>So the Good is capable of doing<br />very unpleasant things,</i>
1766847 1769464 <i>i.e., cutting Tuco loose in the desert,</i>
1769558 1772346 <i>the Bad is pretty capable of doing<br />horrible things,</i>
1772436 1774177 <i>and the Ugly isn't ugly at all.</i>
1774271 1776933 <i>He's actually the most attractive character<br />in the movie.</i>
1777024 1779686 <i>So part of Leone's idea is to take<br />those three labels</i>
1779776 1783019 <i>which are usually treated as absolutes<br />or as essential characteristics,</i>
1783113 1788699 <i>Good, Bad, Ugly, and actually say, "In real<br />life people are a bit more complicated."</i>
1789036 1791494 <i>And the Good is perhaps<br />the most complicated of all.</i>
1791580 1794663 <i>Because he's less trustworthy in some<br />respects than Tuco.</i>
1794750 1796161 <i>Towards the end of the film,</i>
1796251 1800336 <i>Tuco honors his side of the bargain<br />by giving away a piece of information.</i>
1800422 1803039 <i>But the Good doesn't honor<br />his side of the bargain</i>
1803133 1804733 <i>and doesn't give the proper information.</i>
1804760 1807593 <i>So in some respect<br />he's less trustworthy than the Ugly.</i>
1807679 1809511 <i>So these labels aren't absolutes.</i>
1809598 1813683 <i>He's deconstructing the signs,<br />if you want to use an elaborate term.</i>
1813769 1816431 <i>But he's taking the words<br />from the traditional Western</i>
1816521 1819183 <i>and saying they're<br />a bit more complicated than that.</i>
1819274 1821231 <i>We're now in Santa Ana at night.</i>
1821318 1826404 <i>It's another corner of Carlo Simi's<br />El Paso set from</i> For a Few Dollars More.
1826490 1831360 <i>And Maria the prostitute<br />is played by the actress Rada Rassimov.</i>
1831453 1835913 <i>She's coming back home<br />expecting to find her boyfriend,</i>
1835999 1838536 <i>but of course instead<br />she finds Lee Van Cleef</i>
1838627 1840914 <i>who's got the information<br />from the half-soldier</i>
1841004 1844463 <i>and is on the track of Bill Carson<br />and the gold.</i>
1845425 1846425 Bill?
1848470 1854807 <i>It has to be said that women are not<br />treated well in Leone's early Westerns.</i>
1854893 1856679 <i>They tend to be either<br />Madonnas or whores,</i>
1856770 1858727 <i>and this is an example of the latter.</i>
1858814 1862057 <i>And Lee Van Cleef was so upset about<br />what he had to do in a moment,</i>
1862150 1864562 <i>slapping this woman around<br />to get the information,</i>
1864653 1866644 <i>that he actually refused to do it.</i>
1866738 1871107 <i>And they had to use a body double for<br />the hands actually striking the woman</i>
1871201 1874159 <i>and then do cut-aways of Van Cleef<br />standing there,</i>
1874246 1876265 <i>"'cause he said, " There are very few<br />principles I have in life</i>
1876289 1877642 <i>"and one of them is I don't kick dogs,"</i>
1877666 1880203 <i>"and the other one is<br />I don't slap women in movies."</i>
1880293 1882785 <i>So Leone had to arrange it a different way.</i>
1882879 1884335 Where is he?
1892180 1896424 <i>Much of this was pruned on first release<br />for censorship reasons.</i>
1896518 1898304 <i>It's fairly extreme.</i>
1899062 1902930 <i>And the whirring violins again,<br />like we got at Stevens' farm</i>
1903024 1905015 <i>where the family were massacred.</i>
1906194 1908606 <i>Reserved for moments of extreme tension.</i>
1909739 1913528 <i>There's a brutality about</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
1913618 1916030 <i>that has this strange mixture<br />of slapstick...</i>
1916121 1918681 <i>Someone once called it "slapstick<br />with a gun license," you know.</i>
1918707 1923793 <i>There's slapstick on the one hand and all<br />this comedy with Tuco and Eli Wallach</i>
1923879 1926541 <i>and the comedy<br />of the iconic Clint Eastwood,</i>
1926631 1929589 <i>but there's also<br />this heavy physical brutality</i>
1929676 1932716 <i>which is partly to do with the Civil War<br />but is also a part of Leone's style.</i>
1935807 1941223 <i>Tuco's made it across the desert<br />and walks across this Carlo Simi bridge</i>
1941313 1944647 <i>which is across a river that's long since<br />dried up,</i>
1944733 1946474 <i>one of the ramblers of Almería.</i>
1946568 1949481 <i>It's a wonderful sort of pointless image,</i>
1949571 1952654 <i>a bridge across a nonexistent river,<br />and he makes his way into the town,</i>
1952741 1957156 <i>according to the shooting script,<br />the town of Buffalo Wallow.</i>
1958580 1962699 <i>And this town was another corner<br />of Carlo Simi's El Paso set,</i>
1962792 1966330 <i>which is a very substantial set in Almería,</i>
1966421 1970915 <i>and you can see... Hardened buffs<br />can recognize the hilts in the background.</i>
1971009 1973296 <i>It's one of the side streets of El Paso.</i>
1974804 1978763 <i>It was obviously a great investment<br />near Tabernas in Almería</i>
1978850 1980932 <i>and it is in fact still standing.</i>
1982103 1985516 <i>It's interesting, Tuco in the movie<br />is actually tougher than Blondie</i>
1985607 1987189 <i>because when Eastwood<br />is confronted with</i>
1987275 1990233 <i>having to walk across 70 miles<br />of glorious sun-baked sand</i>
1990320 1991435 <i>he can't make it.</i>
1991530 1994864 <i>His face gets blistered,<br />he passes out and he's about to die</i>
1994950 1996987 <i>as we'll see later in the film.<br />But Tuco makes it.</i>
1997077 2000536 <i>And on various occasions<br />Tuco is physically more tough</i>
2000622 2002829 <i>than his counterpart.</i>
2004000 2005866 <i>In the shooting script,<br />this is Mr. Jackson.</i>
2005961 2008623 <i>Mr. Jackson's gun shop.</i>
2009422 2010708 <i>But during the shooting,</i>
2010799 2013336 <i>because they changed the name of<br />one of the bad guys to Jackson,</i>
2013426 2014507 <i>so it got confusing,</i>
2014594 2019464 <i>he became Mr. Milton the gunsmith,<br />who's played by Enzo Petito.</i>
2019558 2022220 <i>To make it even more confusing,<br />on the final script</i>
2022310 2024677 <i>Buffalo Wallow turned into Valverde.</i>
2024771 2027638 <i>So they decided that this was<br />the town of Valverde after all.</i>
2027732 2031521 <i>Basically they're jockeying around<br />with the map of New Mexico</i>
2031611 2034729 <i>and the Texas border in 1861, '62,</i>
2034823 2038657 <i>taking various names<br />from Sibley's invasion</i>
2038743 2042702 <i>and jockeying them for position<br />and attributing them to various villages.</i>
2042789 2045281 <i>So this may be Buffalo Wallow,<br />it might be Valverde,</i>
2045375 2047366 <i>and frankly it doesn't matter.</i>
2047669 2052163 <i>And here's Tuco<br />choosing his weapon for preference.</i>
2052924 2057760 <i>And he ends up with a composite gun<br />that has the handle of a Navy Colt,</i>
2057846 2061009 <i>a Smith & Wesson chamber<br />and a Colt barrel.</i>
2061099 2063932 <i>The weapon of choice of Blondie<br />is a Navy Colt,</i>
2064019 2068434 <i>and when he's shooting through ropes,<br />a Henry rifle with a telescopic sight.</i>
2068523 2071015 <i>And in the final scene he ends up<br />with a Sharps' rifle.</i>
2071109 2073396 <i>Angel Eyes, who eventually enlists,</i>
2073486 2076228 <i>as we'll see, in the American Civil War<br />on the Union side,</i>
2076323 2077939 <i>has a new model Army Remington.</i>
2078033 2080320 <i>So there's a lot of detail of firearms.</i>
2080410 2083198 <i>Leone was something<br />of an American firearms buff</i>
2083288 2086826 <i>and so was Carlo Simi. They amassed<br />a large archive on the subject.</i>
2086916 2089783 <i>And Eli Wallach reminisced to me<br />about when he was shooting the scene,</i>
2089878 2092370 <i>he had to make it look<br />as though he knew what he was doing.</i>
2092464 2095126 <i>Picking up the guns,<br />listening to the sound they made.</i>
2095216 2098960 <i>The interchangeable parts between<br />the Colt guns and the Smith & Wesson.</i>
2099055 2102673 <i>And actually he knew absolutely nothing<br />about firearms. He had to pretend.</i>
2102767 2106305 <i>But everyone believed him, he really looks<br />as though he knows what he's doing here.</i>
2106395 2112061 <i>A celebration of the industrial design<br />of the revolver, interchangeable parts.</i>
2113402 2115313 <i>He customizes his own gun</i>
2115404 2117444 <i>from the first piece of industrial design<br />in history</i>
2117531 2119772 <i>that had fully interchangeable parts.</i>
2122578 2124569 <i>And this sequence, which was in fact cut</i>
2124664 2129659 <i>from early American and English<br />prints of the film,</i>
2129752 2131563 <i>it's a long story<br />about the length of the film,</i>
2131587 2135672 <i>but originally it was three hours long<br />and it was cut to 148 minutes,</i>
2135758 2138125 <i>and this was<br />one of the sequences that went,</i>
2138219 2140085 <i>the sequence at the gunsmith.</i>
2141263 2143846 <i>The original idea for the sequence<br />in fact came from</i>
2143933 2146846 <i>the James Cagney film,</i> Public Enemy,
2146936 2150770 <i>where Cagney goes into a shop,<br />and tries to buy something</i>
2150856 2153188 <i>and the shop owner says...<br />And he says, "How much?"</i>
2153275 2156688 <i>And the shop owner says, "$20."<br />"No, how much?" "$40."</i>
2156779 2158395 <i>"No, how much?" "$60."</i>
2158489 2160571 <i>And what you think is<br />a commercial transaction</i>
2160658 2162615 <i>is in fact a robbing of the shop.</i>
2162702 2165444 <i>And that's what gave the scriptwriters<br />the idea for this.</i>
2165538 2168747 <i>Very often the stimulus for the script<br />wasn't just Westerns,</i>
2168833 2170870 <i>but was film noir gangster movies,</i>
2170960 2172701 <i>remembered moments<br />from Hollywood films.</i>
2172795 2174752 <i>In fact, there's two moments<br />from Buster Keaton</i>
2174839 2176705 <i>as we'll see later on in this film.</i>
2176799 2179336 <i>So they're fairly<br />eclectic in their sources.</i>
2179802 2182260 <i>This was a rare reference<br />in Italian Westerns</i>
2182346 2184383 <i>to the Native Americans, the Indians.</i>
2184473 2188057 <i>A comment about racism, really,<br />in the Western,</i>
2188144 2191808 <i>where cardboard cutouts,<br />wooden cutouts of Native Americans</i>
2191897 2194980 <i>are used for target practice<br />at the back of a gun shop.</i>
2195943 2198310 <i>Tuco thinks he's knocked over all three.</i>
2199655 2201111 <i>And in fact he has.</i>
2209039 2212748 <i>And here's the moment taken<br />from Cagney, where we realize...</i>
2212835 2215021 <i>I mean, how on Earth can Tuco,<br />having walked across the desert</i>
2215045 2219460 <i>with no money in his pocket,<br />how can he actually pay for this gun?</i>
2219550 2220836 <i>Well, we're about to find out.</i>
2220926 2225170 <i>The hat, by the way, was from<br />Western Costume in Hollywood.</i>
2225264 2229428 <i>Eli Wallach chose it with the veteran<br />Western director Henry Hathaway</i>
2229518 2232431 <i>and brought it over to Spain with him.</i>
2232521 2235263 <i>Leone loved it, thought it looked great.<br />Said, "Let's keep it in."</i>
2235357 2237519 <i>This process of improvisation again.</i>
2240696 2242733 <i>Tuco's part got bigger and bigger<br />and bigger.</i>
2242823 2245906 <i>If you read the shooting script,<br />it's not actually that large a part</i>
2245993 2248155 <i>but in the movie he comes to dominate.</i>
2248245 2250782 <i>And in one sense<br />Clint Eastwood was right to be worried.</i>
2250873 2253240 <i>He's become kind of a guest star<br />in his own movie.</i>
2253334 2256452 <i>Hugely iconic, hugely charismatic.</i>
2256545 2260379 <i>But Eli Wallach is walking away with<br />the movie from under everyone's nose.</i>
2260466 2261581 <i>And having a terrific time.</i>
2261675 2263040 Two hundred dollars.
2263135 2264796 It's all I've got.
2265721 2266836 Here.
2279109 2280949 <i>But at least he leaves him<br />a bottle of whiskey,</i>
2281028 2286523 <i>and later on Lee Van Cleef<br />will do the same in a similar situation,</i>
2286617 2290076 <i>which is a sign that he has a little<br />bit of humanity. He may be a rogue,</i>
2290162 2292449 <i>he may be on the take,<br />he may be a con man</i>
2292540 2294372 <i>but there's a streak of humanity in him.</i>
2294458 2296620 <i>At least leave the guy some whiskey.</i>
2299672 2302255 <i>"Closed," mouth closed, very Leone gag.</i>
2305886 2309220 <i>Now this sequence was in fact cut</i>
2309306 2314847 <i>just after the Italian premiere<br />of the movie at Christmas, 1966.</i>
2314937 2319272 <i>And was only put back 35 years later<br />on recent prints.</i>
2319358 2325525 <i>And it's Tuco<br />recruiting the three Mexican heavies</i>
2325614 2327730 <i>that will help him find Blondie.</i>
2329034 2333403 <i>The voice was done by Eli Wallach<br />35 years after the event</i>
2333497 2337912 <i>and it didn't appear in release prints<br />in Italy, in America or in England.</i>
2338002 2341040 <i>So in fact this scene is the one scene<br />that's been put back lately</i>
2341130 2343417 <i>that really wasn't<br />in the Italian release print.</i>
2343507 2346295 <i>It was cut by Leone<br />just after the Italian premiere</i>
2346385 2348547 <i>'cause he thought the movie at<br />180 minutes</i>
2348637 2350924 <i>was running for a little bit too long.</i>
2351056 2356677 <i>But, here we are in... Looks like a disused<br />mineshaft or a war-scarred building</i>
2356770 2359137 <i>with Tuco trying to find his colleagues.</i>
2367781 2370239 <i>And just as he was clutching a chicken<br />in the first scene</i>
2370326 2374160 <i>as he broke through the window of<br />that windswept ghost town,</i>
2374246 2377238 <i>he's clutching a chicken now<br />for no apparent reason.</i>
2381211 2382451 <i>And now he has a monologue.</i>
2382546 2383957 Potatoes.
2385424 2388132 You've got to be poor to eat potatoes.
2388218 2391301 <i>But it isn't a monologue 'cause he knows<br />that somebody's listening up there</i>
2391388 2393800 <i>and he's got to attract their attention.</i>
2394016 2395256 But I'm lonely.
2397603 2400391 The world is divided into two parts,
2400481 2405442 those who have friends,<br />and those who are lonely, like poor Tuco.
2405527 2409612 <i>"The world is divided into two parts."<br />Second reference to that great phrase.</i>
2410658 2413150 I used to have a friend, Pedro.
2414036 2417620 Chico and Ramon, his two brothers,<br />were my friends too.
2422211 2427627 <i>He obviously realizes that<br />Chico and Ramon are listening up there</i>
2427716 2430048 <i>but he's somehow got to<br />attract their attention.</i>
2430135 2433218 <i>Best thing to do is to mention money<br />rather than food,</i>
2433305 2436764 <i>the next best thing,<br />and maybe they'll show some interest.</i>
2436850 2439888 <i>And some ropes will appear from above</i>
2441605 2443687 <i>and the gang will be complete.</i>
2446068 2448935 <i>One can see why Leone cut this sequence.</i>
2449029 2452613 <i>It does slow down the action<br />after the gunsmith</i>
2452700 2455692 <i>and before Tuco finds, catches up<br />with Blondie.</i>
2455786 2459996 <i>And in a way you don't need to know how<br />these three bad guys were recruited.</i>
2460082 2462619 <i>It's a funny moment<br />as the ropes come down the shaft</i>
2462710 2464997 <i>and, you know, first of all with food,<br />then with money</i>
2465087 2466623 <i>and attracting their attention.</i>
2466714 2471174 <i>But he actually cut it himself<br />before the Italian release print.</i>
2471260 2475675 <i>And it's great for completists<br />but I do feel it slows down the action.</i>
2478600 2480136 <i>Tuco's bizarre crossing of himself.</i>
2480227 2483094 <i>And I once asked Eli Wallach<br />where on Earth he got that idea from</i>
2483188 2484428 <i>which he improvised on the set.</i>
2484481 2488520 <i>He said he got it from growing up<br />in Little Italy, in New York,</i>
2488610 2493855 <i>where he would see his Roman Catholic<br />compadres, children,</i>
2493949 2497237 <i>crossing themselves in that way<br />and wiping their nose at the same time.</i>
2497327 2499567 <i>And he thought,<br />"Yeah, that will come in useful one day."</i>
2500789 2502709 <i>So it becomes<br />one of the characteristics of Tuco.</i>
2503375 2505742 <i>And here we are in Santa Fe,</i>
2505836 2508794 <i>which is yet another part<br />of Carlo Simi's El Paso set</i>
2508881 2513216 <i>from</i> For a Few Dollars More, <i>being<br />recycled for the third or fourth time.</i>
2513302 2516044 <i>And the Confederate artillery<br />are coming through</i>
2516805 2519388 <i>and the hotel is in fact the hotel<br />that had been featured</i>
2519475 2521512 <i>in</i> For a Few dollars More.
2521602 2526221 <i>The hotel room where Blondie is staying<br />with the gun that he has taken to pieces</i>
2526315 2528977 <i>is the hotel room<br />which was occupied by Colonel Mortimer,</i>
2529068 2531901 <i>Lee Van Cleef, in the earlier film.</i>
2532404 2536238 <i>This is first really direct reference to<br />the Civil War in the movie,</i>
2536325 2541195 <i>the specifics of the Civil War<br />between 1861 and spring 1862,</i>
2541288 2546203 <i>and the only reference to a real historical<br />character in the whole cinema of Leone,</i>
2546293 2549877 <i>because General Sibley<br />is about to be shown in person.</i>
2549963 2554173 <i>There he is, and he's on an ambulance,<br />which is a kind of euphemism</i>
2554259 2557047 <i>for the fact that he was often indisposed<br />during the campaign.</i>
2557137 2558468 <i>Actually, he was an alcoholic</i>
2558555 2562264 <i>and he often had some difficulty<br />keeping control of himself.</i>
2562351 2564638 <i>So the idea of Sibley<br />arriving by ambulance</i>
2564728 2567561 <i>surrounded by these bearded<br />Santa Fe gamblers,</i>
2567648 2571232 <i>his bodyguard,<br />is a kind of historical accuracy.</i>
2571318 2575937 <i>It's very unusual for Leone<br />to have that realistic view of history.</i>
2576031 2577613 <i>And it's a slightly jarring moment.</i>
2577699 2580059 <i>"He once said, " I don't want to make<br />a movie about Napoleon,</i>
2580119 2581805 <i>"I don't want to make a movie<br />about Davy Crockett."</i>
2581829 2583945 <i>"I like making movies<br />about ordinary people"</i>
2584039 2587452 <i>"who get caught up in these events<br />despite their best intentions."</i>
2587543 2591002 <i>But there's a moment where Sibley<br />actually makes an appearance.</i>
2591672 2595461 <i>So, Tuco has assembled<br />his three compadres</i>
2595551 2597792 <i>and they're going to find Blondie.</i>
2599346 2601428 You rotten criminals. How dare you?
2601515 2603131 <i>Unusual use of a gun.</i>
2603392 2604392 <i>[SHUSHING]</i>
2604476 2606717 <i>Holding the barrel up to his lips.</i>
2607521 2610309 <i>And Blondie's taking<br />his Colt Navy to pieces.</i>
2610399 2614734 <i>Notice the snake grips<br />on the handle of the gun,</i>
2614820 2619360 <i>which were in fact from Clint Eastwood's<br />revolver in</i> Rawhide.
2620117 2622679 <i>It was a sort of good luck charm to use it<br />in the Italian Westerns,</i>
2622703 2624319 <i>just like the gun belt.</i>
2625497 2629331 <i>Firearms experts tell me that there's<br />a bit of a historical inaccuracy here.</i>
2629418 2634083 <i>Navy Colts in the American Civil War<br />were percussion cap pistols.</i>
2634882 2637002 <i>So, he's got a Colt Navy<br />and he's taking it to pieces,</i>
2637050 2640509 <i>but he's got Colt .45 metallic cartridges<br />that he's putting into them.</i>
2640596 2642758 <i>So there's a little bit of<br />a slip there historically.</i>
2642848 2646682 <i>Great detail. Very Leone that.<br />That the surface detail looks accurate.</i>
2646768 2649851 <i>And guns being taken to pieces<br />and all this hardware outside,</i>
2649938 2653681 <i>Witworth canons<br />and American Civil War artillery pieces.</i>
2653775 2657894 <i>But percussion cap pistols<br />don't shoot quickly enough,</i>
2657988 2660776 <i>so let's have metallic cartridges.<br />What the hell?</i>
2671877 2676713 <i>The cross-cutting of these two scenes,<br />again, took Leone into a different league</i>
2676798 2678709 <i>from the production point of view.</i>
2678800 2681838 <i>Hundreds of extras<br />in Confederate uniforms</i>
2681929 2687390 <i>in the street outside of Santa Fe with<br />all these troops, the artillery and so on,</i>
2687476 2689467 <i>largely played by the Spanish army,</i>
2689561 2692929 <i>courtesy indirectly of General Franco,</i>
2693023 2696141 <i>who wanted to attract<br />all sorts of movie-makers</i>
2696235 2698272 <i>to actually make films in Spain.</i>
2698737 2701855 <i>Inter-cut with this thrilling moment of,</i>
2701949 2706694 <i>"Will he get the gun back together again<br />in time in order to shoot the people"</i>
2706787 2709495 <i>"who are coming to get him<br />in this hotel bedroom?"</i>
2712292 2714479 <i>Clint Eastwood once said...<br />Someone once asked Clint Eastwood</i>
2714503 2719088 <i>whether General Franco minded<br />the slightly subversive movies about war</i>
2719174 2722508 <i>which aren't very good on chivalry<br />and rhetoric and patriotism.</i>
2722594 2724364 <i>They have a much more<br />down-to-earth attitude to life.</i>
2724388 2727631 <i>The point is survival,<br />to get through this war intact.</i>
2727724 2731092 <i>And did Franco mind that? And he said,<br />"Franco didn't mind so long as</i>"
2731186 2733039 <i>"you didn't make a movie<br />set in contemporary Spain."</i>
2733063 2735270 <i>If you make a movie set<br />in the 19th century</i>
2735357 2736643 <i>in the Wild West of America,</i>
2736733 2741068 <i>he didn't care at all, that he<br />just wanted the money to flow into Spain</i>
2741154 2743612 <i>and work for Spanish technicians<br />and craftspeople</i>
2743699 2746236 <i>and set builders and the laboratories.</i>
2746952 2750161 <i>So, a very subversive look<br />at the American Civil War</i>
2750455 2753117 <i>was made in Spain in 1966.</i>
2765178 2768887 <i>Part of the image of the war came from<br />the film</i> La Grande guerra,
2768974 2770590 <i>the film about the First World War,</i>
2770684 2775224 <i>but it also came from a book that<br />Luciano Vincenzoni had been reading</i>
2775314 2778648 <i>for many years by a man<br />called Ferdinand Céline,</i>
2778734 2783069 <i>a French writer, which was also set<br />in the First World War.</i>
2783155 2786489 <i>And Céline's book is all about<br />a hero called Ferdinand</i>
2786575 2789033 <i>who finds himself in absurd situations<br />in the war.</i>
2789119 2790951 <i>He doesn't want anything<br />to do with the war</i>
2791038 2793224 <i>but he keeps finding himself<br />tangled up in the First World War,</i>
2793248 2797242 <i>in the Ardennes and in Flanders,<br />and there's chance encounters,</i>
2797336 2799293 <i>there's all sorts of coincidences.</i>
2799379 2801666 <i>There is extreme brutality and gore</i>
2801757 2805125 <i>and surrealism going on all around him,<br />and the atmosphere of the book,</i>
2805218 2807300 <i>which is called</i><br />Journey to the End of the Night,
2807387 2809344 <i>which is Vincenzoni's favorite book,</i>
2809431 2811242 <i>permeates the whole of</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
2811266 2814008 <i>Instead of the First World War<br />it's the American Civil War,</i>
2814102 2817720 <i>"but the absurdist message<br />that, "Don't believe in ideals,</i>
2817814 2822650 <i>'just believe in survival,"<br />actually is the thing they have in common.</i>
2822736 2824693 <i>This is a version of the American Civil War</i>
2824780 2826737 <i>for readers</i> of Catch-22
2826823 2830282 <i>and for recent listeners to Bob Dylan's</i><br />With God on Our Side.
2830369 2833782 <i>It actually had this atmosphere<br />of the mid '60s to a T,</i>
2833872 2835533 <i>where the war was concerned.</i>
2835624 2837331 <i>I once saw</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
2837417 2841081 <i>in summer 1968 in San Francisco<br />in a cinema,</i>
2841171 2843879 <i>and later on<br />when the Clint Eastwood character</i>
2843965 2846297 <i>commenting on the war says,<br />"I've never seen so many men</i>
2846385 2849423 <i>"wasted so badly,"<br />the entire cinema erupted.</i>
2849513 2851629 <i>It was at the height of the Vietnam War,</i>
2851723 2855887 <i>and the attitude to war as a kind<br />of absurd bloody nightmare</i>
2855977 2859811 <i>and the issue was survival<br />absolutely captured the moment.</i>
2859898 2865143 <i>It may be set in the 1860s but it had<br />a huge resonance in the mid-1960s as well.</i>
2870867 2873279 <i>And there is a moment coming up<br />where, paradoxically,</i>
2873370 2876408 <i>the war actually saves Blondie's skin.</i>
2876498 2879581 <i>It's the first of three occasions in<br />the film where the war intervenes</i>
2879668 2883286 <i>to save the life of one of the characters.</i>
2883380 2889296 <i>On this occasion it's the old rope trick<br />with Tuco getting his revenge</i>
2889386 2892674 <i>for all those times he had nearly died<br />with the rope scam earlier.</i>
2892764 2898259 <i>And a mortar will score a direct hit on<br />the hotel which will save Blondie's life.</i>
2898353 2901436 <i>Later on a Confederate ambulance<br />in the middle of the desert,</i>
2901523 2904265 <i>just as Blondie<br />is about to be shot by Tuco,</i>
2904359 2908273 <i>comes into earshot and eyeshot<br />and saves his life.</i>
2908363 2913108 <i>And later still Tuco is about to be thumped<br />by Sergeant Wallace</i>
2913201 2917911 <i>at the concentration camp and the<br />hoot of a train signal saves his life.</i>
2917998 2920956 <i>So the war,<br />which is going on all around them,</i>
2921042 2925377 <i>they are trying to get out through<br />this battle zone in order to find the gold,</i>
2925464 2929082 <i>the war is a necessary evil,<br />actually serves to save their lives.</i>
2929176 2932794 <i>It's one of the paradoxes, one of<br />the surreal paradoxes of this film.</i>
2932888 2934504 <i>It has a splendid sense of construction,</i>
2934598 2938842 <i>the way the war is brought into the story<br />at certain moments.</i>
2942272 2945890 <i>Eastwood wearing a very '60s hippy shirt<br />on this occasion.</i>
2945984 2948851 <i>Only later in the film will he don his<br />famous denim shirt</i>
2948945 2951107 <i>and sheepskin waistcoat and poncho.</i>
2954326 2957444 <i>There's the mortar, there's the direct hit.</i>
2982103 2984185 <i>Eastwood's part of the main title theme.</i>
2985315 2989149 <i>And this is a sequence that was<br />in the Italian print</i>
2989236 2991648 <i>but was cut from the American<br />and British prints</i>
2991738 2995026 of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,<br /><i>and was only put back 35 years later.</i>
2995116 2999405 <i>It's Sentenza, Angel Eyes,<br />played by Lee Van Cleef,</i>
3000956 3002572 <i>riding through the desert.</i>
3002666 3007035 <i>And the first reference<br />to the American Civil War theme</i>
3007128 3010462 <i>on Morricone's soundtrack.<br />He wrote various Civil War themes.</i>
3010549 3015544 <i>One,</i> A Ballad of a Soldier,<br /><i>one for the battle, and one for a march.</i>
3015887 3019380 <i>And it's this mixture of,<br />sort of, bugles and lament</i>
3019474 3022091 <i>and a sort of yearning theme for the war.</i>
3022185 3025018 <i>And he arrives in this burned-out ranch</i>
3025105 3028223 <i>that according to the shooting script<br />is called Koslowski's Ranch.</i>
3028316 3032856 <i>It was an actual historic place<br />involved in the Sibley campaign.</i>
3032946 3036905 <i>A burned-out civilian ranch,<br />20 miles south of Santa Fe,</i>
3036992 3041031 <i>where the Bad, played by Lee Van Cleef,</i>
3041121 3047242 <i>encounters real badness in the form of<br />the mayhem that the Civil War has caused.</i>
3047335 3051203 <i>There's a wonderful shot now<br />as the camera goes around to him,</i>
3051298 3053005 <i>taking his point of view.</i>
3054968 3057881 <i>Very expansive shot, very redundant shot<br />in Hollywood terms,</i>
3057971 3060338 <i>but a marvelous piece of Leone's rhetoric,</i>
3060432 3065518 <i>just seeing the mayhem that the war has<br />caused at a ranch in New Mexico.</i>
3066938 3070476 <i>And Leone said that scenes like this<br />were very much based on</i>
3070567 3075778 <i>the Charlie Chaplin film made in the 1940s</i><br />Monsieur Verdoux,
3075864 3078447 <i>which is all about a Bluebeard figure,<br />a murderer,</i>
3078533 3081366 <i>who, in court, when he is accused<br />of murdering all his wives,</i>
3081453 3085617 <i>says, "Compared to Mr. Roosevelt<br />and Mr. Stalin, I'm a mere amateur."</i>
3085707 3087118 <i>It's a comedy of murders</i>
3087208 3090075 <i>where the domestic murders<br />engaged in by Chaplin</i>
3090170 3094255 <i>are set against the mass murders<br />of the Second World War,</i>
3094341 3097504 <i>and Leone took that idea,<br />he says, and transposed it</i>
3097594 3099335 <i>again into the American Civil War.</i>
3099429 3102342 <i>Yes, Lee Van Cleef<br />may be a very nasty man,</i>
3102432 3105925 <i>but look what the war does<br />to Confederates.</i>
3106019 3109262 <i>Another example of mutilation.<br />We have had a legless soldier.</i>
3109356 3114192 <i>Here's one with one leg and all sorts of<br />people crouched in this ranch.</i>
3115070 3118028 <i>The mayhem of war.<br />We really are in a battle zone.</i>
3121368 3124201 <i>Slight shake of the head<br />from Lee Van Cleef.</i>
3124287 3126278 <i>Even he is upset by this.</i>
3127123 3130661 <i>But he is on the track of Carson,<br />wants to find out where he is.</i>
3131211 3133828 <i>So he's gotta find someone to ask,</i>
3133922 3138382 <i>and eventually he finds<br />a Confederate sergeant who helps him.</i>
3138468 3141836 <i>The sergeant is played by the actor<br />Víctor Israel,</i>
3141930 3144638 <i>but the voice was actually put in<br />35 years later</i>
3144724 3146385 <i>for the restored print.</i>
3146476 3151437 <i>And Van Cleef's voice is a sound-alike<br />because Lee Van Cleef died in 1989.</i>
3152273 3156267 <i>On Lee Van Cleef's gravestone<br />are the words "The best of the bad."</i>
3156361 3159069 Our government has spared no expense.
3159155 3161522 As you can see, we are treated very well.
3161616 3164950 <i>They're living on corn cobs.<br />Another reference to food.</i>
3165036 3168870 <i>We've had chicken in the pot,<br />we've had minestrone soup.</i>
3168957 3171244 <i>There's lots of references to eating,</i>
3171334 3177296 <i>but starving troops, wounded troops, at<br />Koslowski's Ranch living on corn cobs.</i>
3178216 3180583 And you ask me if I know someone.
3181594 3184507 I just don't know what you drifters<br />could be thinking.
3184597 3189717 <i>First of all, the sergeant thinks that<br />Angel Eyes might be a deserter,</i>
3189811 3193224 <i>and when he realizes that he isn't,<br />he decides to give him information.</i>
3193314 3195167 <i>And the second transaction<br />with a whiskey bottle.</i>
3195191 3199401 <i>Earlier, we've had Tuco giving the<br />half-drunk whiskey bottle to the gunsmith,</i>
3199487 3203025 <i>and now we have the Bad giving<br />the whiskey to the Confederate sergeant.</i>
3203116 3204447 <i>He's not all bad.</i>
3204534 3205820 They've already left.
3206494 3208110 For Glorieta.
3208204 3212368 Canby's front line is right on their heels.<br />Those poor young devils.
3212667 3217082 <i>Glorieta was the battle<br />where Sibley was decisively thrashed</i>
3217172 3221416 <i>in the spring of 1862.<br />Another specific historic reference.</i>
3221509 3224422 <i>So the Confederates have been pushing<br />into New Mexico.</i>
3224512 3228005 <i>After Glorieta, they're pushed back again<br />in a very ignominious retreat</i>
3228099 3232093 <i>across the desert back to their base<br />in Texas, which had huge tosses.</i>
3232187 3235305 <i>Five hundred Confederate dead,<br />500 captured.</i>
3235398 3238516 <i>It was a disastrous campaign for Sibley.</i>
3238610 3241693 <i>But Glorieta was the place where<br />the great confrontation took place.</i>
3242989 3247608 <i>And now we are back to a scene<br />that was in all the original prints</i>
3247702 3251366 <i>as Tuco rides through the Almerían desert</i>
3251456 3254039 <i>and comes to a crossroads,<br />which actually had featured in</i>
3254125 3255957 For a Few Dollars More.
3256044 3259537 <i>Last time this was used,<br />Lee Van Cleef went to the left.</i>
3260006 3261838 <i>He's looking for Blondie,</i>
3263176 3265634 <i>and all he finds is a cigar stub.</i>
3265720 3268212 <i>And in fact,<br />there was a famous missing sequence</i>
3268306 3271640 <i>that was actually shot<br />but was cut by Leone.</i>
3271726 3274138 <i>But little bits of it<br />turn up in the French trailer,</i>
3274229 3277767 <i>in between the Lee Van Cleef scene<br />and this in the desert,</i>
3277857 3283694 <i>which takes place at a town called<br />Socorro, in the piazza of Socorro,</i>
3283780 3287819 <i>where you have someone doing<br />a recruiting speech for the Confederates</i>
3287909 3291948 <i>and Tuco takes a hat around<br />the women and the old men</i>
3292038 3293995 <i>who are listening to this recruiting speech</i>
3294082 3297325 <i>and gathers what they think<br />is a collection for the war,</i>
3297418 3300581 <i>but is in fact for himself,<br />leaves the hat outside,</i>
3300672 3304961 <i>goes into a hotel where Blondie is in bed<br />with a Spanish woman.</i>
3305051 3307338 <i>The only moment in the</i> Dollars <i>films</i>
3307428 3311513 <i>where Clint Eastwood actually has<br />any kind of a relationship with a woman.</i>
3311599 3316560 <i>The woman slips out, steals the hat,<br />Tuco goes out into the street again</i>
3316646 3318290 <i>and sees<br />the money has been taken from the hat</i>
3318314 3320601 <i>and all there is, is a half-lit cigar.</i>
3320859 3324352 <i>So, he's on the track of Blondie,<br />but loses the money,</i>
3324445 3327779 <i>which he was conning out of people<br />who were giving to the Confederacy.</i>
3327866 3330528 <i>That would have happened<br />just before this sequence,</i>
3330618 3333576 <i>with Tuco finding<br />all sorts of burned cigar stubs.</i>
3333663 3336906 <i>The cigarillo is all you need to know<br />about Blondie,</i>
3337000 3340959 <i>and he's getting closer and closer<br />because the cigarillo is still alight.</i>
3341296 3345711 <i>There are stills of the Socorro sequence,<br />little bits of movie in the French trailer,</i>
3345800 3348542 <i>but Leone deliberately cut it<br />'cause he thought at this moment,</i>
3348636 3350673 <i>it really was<br />slowing things down too much,</i>
3350763 3352379 <i>and the movie was getting much too long.</i>
3352473 3355010 <i>He was asked to put in a movie<br />of two hours.</i>
3355101 3358014 <i>It was running for three hours plus.<br />Something had to happen.</i>
3358104 3361472 <i>This was the first movie<br />where Leone had trouble over length.</i>
3362233 3365601 <i>Hereafter, all his movies<br />would overrun like mad,</i>
3365695 3367402 <i>and have to be cut at the last minute,</i>
3367488 3368966 <i>in the case of</i><br />Once Upon a Time in America
3368990 3370856 <i>with disastrous consequences.</i>
3371701 3375820 <i>One of the things about the cuts<br />that occurred after the Italian release</i>
3375914 3379953 <i>is that a lot of the geographical place<br />names disappeared from the movie.</i>
3380043 3385254 <i>So Glorieta, the battlefields of Sibley's<br />campaign, all of those names disappeared,</i>
3385340 3386483 <i>so you don't know where the hell you are.</i>
3386507 3388794 <i>It is a sort of Never-Never Land<br />of the Southwest,</i>
3388885 3391673 <i>a sort of surreal<br />twilight zone in the desert.</i>
3391763 3393049 <i>Does it matter? I don't know.</i>
3393139 3395551 <i>There is more history, certainly,<br />in this print.</i>
3395642 3397929 <i>But does it matter<br />how specific it should be?</i>
3398019 3401603 <i>We are, after all,<br />watching a very strange fantasy.</i>
3402440 3405978 <i>This is a real Almerían village,<br />Adobe Village,</i>
3406069 3408481 <i>which a lot of people thought was a set,</i>
3408571 3413782 <i>but is in fact one of the white-washed<br />villages you find in Central Almería.</i>
3413868 3414983 <i>Near Los Albaricoques,</i>
3415078 3418867 <i>where the final sequence of</i><br />For a Few Dollars More <i>was shot.</i>
3422543 3425035 <i>And there's Eastwood with his Henry rifle.</i>
3429634 3431295 <i>Poor Shorty.</i>
3434055 3435261 Sorry, Shorty.
3435348 3437117 <i>Shorty isn't mentioned<br />in the shooting script.</i>
3437141 3438848 <i>Again, that was either improvised...</i>
3438935 3442303 <i>The idea of<br />calling this hapless man Shorty,</i>
3442397 3445264 <i>it was either improvised<br />or happened at the last minute.</i>
3445942 3449310 <i>And now Tuco is gonna get his revenge<br />with the desert.</i>
3450029 3451815 <i>And these desert sequences were filmed</i>
3451906 3458152 <i>in part of a national park to the east<br />of Almeria called Cabo de Gata.</i>
3458246 3464492 <i>The sand dunes for these miles and miles<br />of glorious sun-baked sand.</i>
3466587 3470501 <i>And if you notice on Tuco's saddle,<br />where it came from I don't know,</i>
3470591 3473754 <i>is a pink parasol behind him,</i>
3473845 3477713 <i>which will lead to<br />one of the great surreal moments.</i>
3477807 3480674 <i>And when Leone was describing<br />these sequences,</i>
3480768 3482121 <i>he was very upset that<br />people thought that</i>
3482145 3484136 <i>they should be cut<br />when the movie first opened.</i>
3484230 3488474 <i>In fact, they were cut to some extent,<br />some details were cut from them.</i>
3488568 3491105 <i>Because he thought that<br />Tonino Delli Colli's camera work</i>
3491195 3494688 <i>was worthy of the great surrealist painters<br />and he said that</i>
3494782 3499994 <i>these sequences in the desert were an<br />example of surrealism riding the range.</i>
3500080 3502663 <i>Sergio Leone<br />was a great collector of paintings.</i>
3502750 3504332 <i>His father had collected paintings,</i>
3504418 3507456 <i>but lost his collection<br />during the Mussolini era,</i>
3507546 3512040 <i>and Leone was determined to<br />build up the family patrimony.</i>
3512134 3514112 <i>And in the year that</i> The Good,<br />the Bad and the Ugly <i>was made,</i>
3514136 3518505 <i>he bought a painting by the Italian<br />surrealist painter Giorgio de Chirico.</i>
3519141 3522054 <i>And it's a painting<br />which is very typical of de Chirico,</i>
3522144 3525557 <i>its high contrast, hard-edged look to it,</i>
3525647 3529766 <i>as if it's in the midday sun,<br />it has a colonnade down the middle,</i>
3529860 3533774 <i>and a statue of the goddess Ariadne,</i>
3533864 3537903 <i>and a very surreal juxtaposition<br />of the goddess and the colonnade</i>
3537993 3539449 <i>and the midday sun,</i>
3539536 3542904 <i>and it's slightly trompe l'œil, but the<br />colonnade leads towards the distance,</i>
3542998 3545581 <i>and in the distance,<br />you have an American locomotive</i>
3545667 3550628 <i>with a smokestack and a cow catcher<br />and smoke coming out of the smokestack.</i>
3550714 3556801 <i>A mixture of the American Wild West<br />and the surreal Rome of 1914.</i>
3556887 3558924 <i>And Leone was<br />very, very fond of de Chirico,</i>
3559014 3560200 <i>and there is no doubt in my mind</i>
3560224 3564593 <i>that a lot of these sequences in the desert<br />were based on de Chirico's paintings.</i>
3564686 3568520 <i>So Tonino Delli Colli is up there with<br />the great surrealist painters,</i>
3568607 3571440 <i>and Delli Colli, when I asked him<br />about this, he said,</i>
3571527 3574087 <i>"Look, we didn't actually have<br />the paintings, as it were, with us</i>
3574113 3576195 <i>"when we were shooting, but very often,"</i>
3576281 3578648 <i>"when we were planning<br />our sequences and our shots,"</i>
3578742 3582451 <i>"yes, we looked at lots of postcards<br />and reproductions of paintings."</i>
3582538 3586281 <i>And there were two other painters<br />that Leone liked referring to in his films.</i>
3586375 3590585 <i>One was Goya, a painting<br />in the Prado Museum in Madrid,</i>
3590671 3592457 <i>which he'd first encountered when making</i>
3592548 3598260 The Last Days of Pompeii<br /><i>in Spain, in the late 1950s.</i>
3598345 3601883 <i>And this was a painting called</i><br />The Third of May 1808.
3601974 3606263 <i>It was painted in 1814, and it's of a<br />firing squad during the Peninsular War.</i>
3606353 3611393 <i>And it shows the French troops lined up<br />shooting a Spanish patriot.</i>
3611567 3615902 <i>And when Tonino Delli Colli first saw that<br />painting, a reproduction of that painting,</i>
3615988 3617966 <i>when they were preparing</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,
3617990 3621858 <i>he said, "My God, the son of a bitch<br />invented back lighting."</i>
3621952 3626116 <i>The way in which the peasant is lit,<br />the way he's so sharp</i>
3626206 3629540 <i>and the rest of it is so sharp, he could<br />have been a lighting cameraman,</i>
3629626 3631708 <i>and that was one source, Goya.</i>
3631795 3634833 <i>And another was the painter<br />Diego Velázquez, because</i>
3634923 3638086 <i>one of Leone's all-time favorite paintings<br />in the Prado</i>
3638177 3641841 <i>was a painting called</i> Las Meninas, <i>1656,</i>
3641930 3643216 <i>or</i> The Maids of Honor,
3643307 3647096 <i>or</i> The Family of Philip IV,<br /><i>which is an amazing royal portrait</i>
3647186 3651020 <i>but it isn't. It shows<br />the back of a canvas,</i>
3651106 3655896 <i>it shows Velázquez looking around<br />the canvas, and it shows the Royal family,</i>
3655986 3659524 <i>which is the subject of the painting,<br />reflected in a mirror in the far distance.</i>
3659615 3661822 <i>And the whole thing<br />is a piece of trompe l'œil</i>
3661909 3664571 <i>about how oil painting happens.</i>
3664661 3667323 <i>It's a painting about the process<br />of doing oil painting,</i>
3667414 3669325 <i>and Leone loved that idea.</i>
3669416 3671828 <i>The juxtaposition,<br />keeping the audience on its toes</i>
3671919 3676379 <i>working out the puzzle of what's going on<br />was very much his style of movie-making.</i>
3676465 3678081 <i>There's a moment later in the film</i>
3678175 3680792 <i>where they first come across<br />the trenches at the bridge,</i>
3680886 3684550 <i>which seems to me to be very much<br />in the tradition of image making.</i>
3684640 3688258 <i>But here, the presiding visual<br />genius is de Chirico.</i>
3688352 3694439 <i>Pink parasol, Mexican bandit on a horse,<br />man in a hippie shirt, it's so surreal.</i>
3694524 3697562 <i>What on Earth are they doing<br />in the middle of the desert of Spain?</i>
3697653 3701942 <i>It's also post</i>-Lawrence of Arabia,
3702032 3706742 <i>and in a way the music by Morricone<br />nods its hat in the direction of</i> Lawrence
3706828 3711072 <i>but also in the direction of biblical epics<br />of the '50s and '60s.</i>
3711166 3717082 <i>Cello, piano, gong and corps anglais<br />playing this insistent desert theme</i>
3717172 3721882 <i>which isn't the jokey main title and<br />isn't the insignias of the main characters.</i>
3721969 3725883 <i>It's the kind of expansive epic music you<br />get in a movie like</i> Lawrence of Arabia,
3725973 3728761 <i>which of course had been<br />a huge success a couple of years earlier,</i>
3728850 3732013 <i>and which had been one of the first<br />movies to use the Almerían desert</i>
3732104 3733936 <i>for the scenes around Aqaba.</i>
3734022 3735933 <i>So</i> Lawrence <i>was very important<br />to everyone</i>
3736024 3738482 <i>when they were shooting in Spain.</i>
3742698 3747158 <i>And here's Tuco at his most sadistic,<br />constantly taunting Blondie,</i>
3747244 3752489 <i>and making as if to help him but actually<br />just having fun at his expense,</i>
3752582 3756371 <i>getting his own back for having<br />walked across the desert himself.</i>
3767973 3769134 <i>Great makeup job.</i>
3769224 3773843 <i>When Clint Eastwood subsequently went<br />on to make a film catted</i> Kelly's Heroes,
3773937 3778727 <i>he was cast opposite the comedy actor,<br />Don Rickles, who said of Clint Eastwood,</i>
3778817 3781650 <i>"He was the only actor who could<br />speak with flies on his lips."</i>
3781737 3783617 <i>And there are various moments<br />in these sequences</i>
3783655 3785758 <i>where there's a lot of flies<br />buzzing around their faces</i>
3785782 3788240 <i>that must have been<br />very carefully worked out.</i>
3788327 3794494 <i>This shot was cut from... The grabbing<br />of the boot and Tuco washing his feet,</i>
3794583 3796352 <i>and then trying to get Eastwood<br />to drink the water</i>
3796376 3799835 <i>that he was washing his feet in<br />were in fact cut from the American print,</i>
3799921 3801958 <i>although they were<br />in the original Italian print,</i>
3802049 3805167 <i>and were only put back 35 years later.</i>
3805260 3808628 <i>This is one of the cuts in the desert<br />sequence that upset Leone</i>
3808722 3811805 <i>because he thought<br />it was so brilliantly shot.</i>
3811892 3818264 <i>These sequences also nod in the direction<br />of a favorite Leone Western,</i> Yellow Sky,
3818357 3822942 <i>made by Wellman in 1948,<br />and shot in Death Valley,</i>
3823028 3826066 <i>where you also have miles<br />and miles of sun-baked sand,</i>
3826156 3829990 <i>and a ghost town with a door<br />made of old wood slamming</i>
3830077 3834196 <i>and coyotes and rags in the wind<br />and that whole kind of desert landscape,</i>
3834289 3836906 <i>and that was a favorite<br />Hollywood Western of Leone.</i>
3837000 3839687 <i>And there is the odd nod in its direction<br />in these desert sequences as well.</i>
3839711 3843375 <i>So you've got this strange mixture of<br />surrealism,</i> Lawrence of Arabia,
3843465 3850132 <i>the American Civil War,</i> Yellow Sky<br /><i>and goodness knows what else.</i>
3850555 3853013 <i>His cinema is nothing if not eclectic.</i>
3853725 3855807 <i>Extreme sadism from Tuco.</i>
3857187 3859394 <i>He may be an attractive character<br />in some ways</i>
3859481 3864521 <i>but he certainly isn't at his most attractive<br />in these sequences as he taunts Blondie,</i>
3864611 3866943 <i>like a cat playing with a mouse.</i>
3880836 3884295 <i>This is very nicely cut into<br />the original print</i>
3884381 3889672 <i>so it's absolutely seamless as Eastwood<br />clambers over a sand dune.</i>
3894182 3897550 <i>Notice that Tuco has his gun in his pocket.</i>
3898395 3899681 <i>Leone's original idea was that</i>
3899771 3902763 <i>he should have this composite gun<br />on a lanyard round his neck</i>
3902858 3906567 <i>and it should be constantly dangling<br />between his legs in a suggestive manner.</i>
3906653 3910112 <i>And he'd do a twist of his hips,<br />and the gun would go up</i>
3910198 3911859 <i>and he would catch it in his hand.</i>
3911950 3915113 <i>And when Wallach tried this the first<br />day on the set he said to Leone,</i>
3915203 3917786 <i>"Well, you have a go<br />and see if it's possible."</i>
3917873 3920080 <i>So Leone put this lanyard round his neck,</i>
3920167 3922207 <i>and had the gun between his legs<br />and tried to do it,</i>
3922294 3925127 <i>and all he did was hit himself<br />in the balls with a Colt gun,</i>
3925213 3927692 <i>and said, " All right, you win.<br />You can put it in your pocket."</i>
3927716 3932131 <i>And thereafter Tuco wore the gun<br />in his pocket throughout the movie.</i>
3932220 3934962 <i>And here he throws a bottle<br />with remarkable aim,</i>
3935056 3940222 <i>I can't believe they did this first time,<br />rolls down the sand and hits Blondie.</i>
3940312 3943771 <i>And bottles are rather<br />improbably American.</i>
3943857 3947100 <i>They look like Chianti bottles<br />from a cantina in Italy.</i>
3947194 3948810 <i>Maybe in New Mexico they are authentic</i>
3948904 3952943 <i>but the whiskey bottles tend<br />to have raffia or rope around them.</i>
3953033 3956901 <i>And they tend to look like the kind of<br />bottles you have hanging in an Italian bar.</i>
3956995 3958611 <i>But this is the moment of truth.</i>
3958705 3961288 <i>Tuco made it across the desert.<br />Blondie is not going to.</i>
3961374 3962977 <i>He isn't tough enough,<br />his skin is too fair.</i>
3963001 3965561 <i>That's what happens to blonds,<br />they are not very good in the sun.</i>
3966588 3970206 <i>And here for the second time,<br />the Civil War intervenes</i>
3970300 3973042 <i>to save their lives,<br />to save Blondie's life.</i>
3974221 3978055 <i>You can hear this carriage<br />and you get the sound of the trumpet,</i>
3978141 3981759 <i>the sound of the bugle<br />for Morricone's Civil War theme</i>
3981853 3985687 <i>as this carriage from nowhere in this<br />surreal way hurtles through the desert.</i>
3985774 3988436 <i>What's it doing<br />in the middle of the desert?</i>
3990445 3994188 <i>Turns out to be a Confederate<br />ambulance at full throttle.</i>
3997118 4001032 <i>Choral interlude. Bugles.</i>
4001122 4004831 <i>It's a wonderful shot<br />but completely unexplained like</i>
4004918 4009412 <i>ghost riders of the sky coming through<br />the desert, and it has distracted Tuco's</i>
4009506 4012840 <i>attention so Blondie lives to fight<br />another day.</i>
4018306 4020013 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
4020100 4021465 Whoa, boy.
4025480 4026891 Easy, easy.
4026982 4029895 Easy, easy. Attaboy. That's nice.
4032988 4035730 <i>It's very Leone, this.<br />The camera is first of all</i>
4035824 4037235 <i>in the driver's seat of the coach.</i>
4037325 4040534 <i>Then this tracking shot along the horses.</i>
4041830 4044117 <i>To tell you that<br />this is the Confederate States' Army,</i>
4044207 4046852 <i>3rd Regiment, and earlier in the film<br />with the half-soldier we've had</i>
4046876 4050961 <i>details about the fact that Carson<br />is involved with the 3rd Regiment,</i>
4051047 4056588 <i>so that alerts us to the fact that maybe<br />although Tuco doesn't know it, maybe</i>
4056678 4062344 <i>Jackson alias Carson is inside this<br />ambulance cart full of Confederates.</i>
4063393 4065100 <i>It's very expansive camera work.<br />You know,</i>
4065186 4068770 <i>in traditional Hollywood terms a lot of<br />Leone's camera work is very redundant,</i>
4068857 4072725 <i>very exaggerated, it is not necessary<br />for the telling of the story.</i>
4072819 4076403 <i>But it creates<br />this atmosphere of flamboyance.</i>
4076489 4078105 <i>He's taking the traditional way of...</i>
4078199 4080406 <i>The traditional Hollywood way of shooting<br />such a scene,</i>
4080493 4083861 <i>if there were such a scene,<br />and notching it up several steps further.</i>
4083955 4087323 <i>He's taking film language<br />and making it more extreme so it draws</i>
4087417 4089909 <i>attention to itself<br />and throughout the movie he does this.</i>
4090003 4091105 <i>In fact,<br />with</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
4091129 4093791 <i>there is a confidence<br />about Leone's camera movements,</i>
4093882 4097876 <i>in some ways the camera just won't<br />keep still, it's constantly on the move.</i>
4097969 4101678 <i>And it's one of..<br />It was his most flamboyant movie so far.</i>
4101765 4104553 <i>It also uses the letterbox<br />image brilliantly. You know,</i>
4104643 4109137 <i>Fritz Lang said that<br />CinemaScope was only useful</i>
4109230 4112439 <i>for snakes and coffins. Well, I think Leone<br />shows that it's pretty good</i>
4112525 4114482 <i>for rifles as well, because it's</i>
4114569 4119188 <i>constantly exploring the barrels<br />of rifles and guns in this letterbox image.</i>
4126414 4129998 <i>Now, in the shooting script,<br />the man with the eye patch is Kid Russell,</i>
4130085 4132918 <i>but in this version<br />he has become Bill Carson,</i>
4133004 4136668 <i>which may be a reference<br />to the famous Army scout Kit Carson,</i>
4136758 4142003 <i>who was in fact historically involved<br />in the Canby-Sibley campaign in 1862,</i>
4142097 4143929 <i>so it may be a reference to Carson,</i>
4144015 4146848 <i>which the Italians found in history books,</i>
4146935 4151270 <i>but Tuco doesn't know any of that.<br />He has to discover it.</i>
4158613 4160945 <i>This snuffbox that he finds here</i>
4161032 4165242 <i>with Carson's name in it<br />will play a key part in the story later on.</i>
4166121 4168783 <i>And this is a very Leone or Wallach gag.</i>
4168873 4171956 <i>He's about to sneeze because of the snuff,</i>
4172043 4174580 <i>but he starts concentrating,<br />he hears a sound behind him,</i>
4174671 4177834 <i>he's got enough self-control<br />to control his sneeze.</i>
4177924 4180336 <i>Because one of the characters is alive.</i>
4180427 4182464 <i>This Confederate corporal.</i>
4188309 4191927 200,000 in gold.<br />It's yours. Just get me water.
4193857 4197691 <i>The role of Jackson alias Carson<br />who at one time</i>
4197777 4201270 <i>was known as Kid Russell<br />is played by Antonio Casale.</i>
4201406 4202646 Carson.
4203074 4205532 My name is Bill Carson now. it's Carson.
4205618 4206887 <i>In fact there's quite a lot of featured</i>
4206911 4209448 <i>Spanish and Italian players<br />playing the three,</i>
4209539 4212372 <i>Baker, Stevens, Carsons, the three...</i>
4212459 4215076 <i>Baker, Stevens, Carson,<br />the three who know the secret</i>
4215170 4219084 <i>of the Confederate gold and who are<br />slowly being pieced together</i>
4219174 4222007 <i>as the story progresses.<br />These are the second leads,</i>
4222093 4223754 <i>as it were, of the movie.</i>
4226556 4228547 Baker has nothing.
4229309 4233177 The gold... I hid the<br />gold. The gold is safe.
4234272 4236229 Where? Where, here?
4236316 4237772 Here? Talk!
4237859 4240476 -Huh?<br />-In the cemetery.
4241696 4244028 -Which cemetery?<br />-The one...
4245033 4248742 <i>And now, we are setting up the story<br />of the second half of the film.</i>
4248828 4251490 <i>The gold is buried in a cemetery.</i>
4251581 4255996 <i>And Tuco gets to<br />hear about the name of the cemetery,</i>
4256085 4259919 <i>but Blondie gets to hear about the name<br />on the grave, so they have reasons to keep</i>
4260006 4263374 <i>each other alive in a very cynical way<br />for the rest of the film because they</i>
4263468 4265175 <i>know half the secret each.</i>
4265261 4266376 Yes?
4267680 4270547 <i>Like the half-soldier,<br />this is a very sick joke</i>
4270642 4273384 <i>about someone who is wounded and dying</i>
4273478 4276311 <i>but wants water,<br />but can't get the name out.</i>
4276397 4279059 You talk first, huh?<br />I'll give you water later.
4279484 4281086 <i>We have had a half-soldier,<br />we are gonna have</i>
4281110 4284648 <i>someone who's had his arm shot off<br />and here's Carson struggling to say</i>
4284739 4287902 <i>something, and all Tuco wants<br />is the information.</i>
4293790 4296407 <i>And the line when Tuco says that,<br />"I am Lincoln's grandmother.</i>"
4296501 4298287 <i>"Tell me what's that about the dollars."</i>
4298378 4300961 <i>In fact in the shooting script<br />it says more prosaically,</i>
4301047 4304210 <i>"And I'm called Lincoln,<br />let's talk about the dollars."</i>
4304300 4308168 <i>So another example of Mickey Knox<br />in translating the Italian script</i>
4308263 4311756 <i>into American,<br />ready for the dubbing studios,</i>
4311850 4314057 <i>making it into a much funnier line.</i>
4316062 4317973 <i>Somehow Blondie has managed to crawl</i>
4318064 4323685 <i>from where he was to the back of this<br />Confederate ambulance and Tuco throws</i>
4323778 4327191 <i>a water canteen at him, not a bottle this<br />time but a water canteen,</i>
4327282 4331492 <i>and scores a direct hit again.<br />It's difficult to imagine</i>
4331578 4333615 <i>back to the mid '60s and how cynical</i>
4333705 4336538 <i>this view<br />of the American Civil War seemed.</i>
4336624 4340367 <i>The traditional Hollywood approach<br />to filming the American Civil War,</i>
4340461 4342372 <i>one thinks immediately<br />of</i> Gone with the Wind,
4342463 4345080 <i>or</i> Raintree County<br /><i>or the Civil War sequence</i>
4345174 4348007 <i>of</i> How the West Was Won,<br /><i>which was directed by John Ford.</i>
4348094 4350239 <i>In fact, there's a famous credit title<br />in</i> How the West Was Won,
4350263 4352300 <i>"The Civil War directed by John Ford,"</i>
4352390 4355052 <i>and to many of us in Europe,<br />actually, it seemed as if he had,</i>
4355143 4358226 <i>but it mattered<br />which side you were fighting for.</i>
4358313 4361681 <i>If you fought for the South,<br />it was nostalgia, Magnolia,</i>
4361774 4366393 <i>moonlight, states given over<br />entirely to the growing of cotton,</i>
4366487 4368273 <i>the old way of life.</i>
4368364 4371152 <i>And there were a lot of Westerns<br />about people who were still</i>
4371242 4374234 <i>fighting the Civil War<br />in the years after 1865,</i>
4374329 4379574 <i>so that mattered, while the North was<br />central government, rationality, Lincoln,</i>
4379667 4382580 <i>the building of the railways,<br />industrialization, and that mattered</i>
4382670 4388211 <i>as well, so which side someone fought for<br />was the moral touchstone of the movie.</i>
4388301 4389757 <i>And they might have seemed cynical,</i>
4389844 4391644 <i>like Robert Stack<br />in</i> Great Day in the Morning,
4391679 4394967 <i>but at the end he actually<br />signs up for the Confederate Army.</i>
4395058 4396219 <i>He finds his commitment.</i>
4396309 4398391 <i>There is something wrong<br />with not being committed.</i>
4398478 4400685 <i>But in this movie,<br />none of the lead characters</i>
4400772 4403605 <i>are remotely interested<br />in the Civil War or what it stands for,</i>
4403691 4405398 <i>it's someone else's war.</i>
4405485 4407601 <i>Rather like the Second World War<br />must have seemed</i>
4407695 4410107 <i>to Sergio Leone as he was growing up<br />in Rome.</i>
4410198 4411939 <i>That Mussolini and the Nazis</i>
4412033 4415651 <i>against the Allies, it seemed like<br />someone else's war, and this is very much</i>
4415745 4419079 <i>the product of that kind of thinking<br />about conflict.</i>
4419165 4421285 <i>It is someone else's war<br />which occasionally intervenes</i>
4421834 4424997 <i>as an irritant in your life, but basically<br />you're after survival,</i>
4425088 4427876 <i>you're after the gold,<br />you're out for number one,</i>
4427966 4431925 <i>you want to make as much money as you<br />can, and everything else is a side issue.</i>
4432011 4435629 <i>It's very much in tune<br />with Joseph Heller's</i> Catch-22
4435723 4439808 <i>and other writings and movies<br />about war in the mid '60s.</i>
4439894 4442206 <i>And indeed like</i> Guerra,<br /><i>this film about the First World War</i>
4442230 4444267 <i>that was made in 1959 initially.</i>
4444357 4450478 <i>But it was a surprisingly cynical view<br />of war in the mid '60s and it chimed</i>
4450571 4452812 <i>when the film came out in 1968<br />in America,</i>
4452907 4455319 <i>it chimed with American thinking<br />about that as well.</i>
4455410 4460155 <i>This is another sequence that was cut<br />after the Italian print was circulated,</i>
4460248 4462660 <i>was cut in the American print<br />and cut in the English print</i>
4462750 4465868 <i>as they arrive at a Confederate bivouac,</i>
4465962 4468829 <i>and the sergeant who takes the message<br />here is played by</i>
4468923 4471836 <i>the same man as played<br />the station master, the ticket collector,</i>
4471926 4474046 <i>in the first sequence<br />of</i> Once Upon a Time in the West,
4474095 4476587 <i>the famous sequence at the station.</i>
4476681 4478763 Are you reading when this man is dying?
4478850 4481182 <i>Where he tries to collect<br />the money from Jack Elam</i>
4481269 4484307 <i>and gets himself locked up<br />in a cupboard for his pains.</i>
4486232 4488849 <i>There's very often a character<br />in Leone's films</i>
4488943 4494905 <i>who is like the sort of "Fuzzy" Burnette<br />or Arthur Hunnicutt, sort of grizzled</i>
4494991 4497323 <i>Western character<br />who is a bit of an eccentric</i>
4497410 4500869 <i>and played by a comedian,<br />and this is an example.</i>
4500955 4504539 <i>A lot of background about where they are<br />and where they are on the map,</i>
4504625 4507868 <i>where they can find somewhere<br />for Blondie to be looked after.</i>
4507962 4512581 <i>It's suggested they go to the<br />San Antonio mission, and again,</i>
4512675 4514666 <i>not essential information,</i>
4514761 4518004 <i>but more of a sense of the fact<br />that they are in a war zone.</i>
4519057 4520968 <i>And here they pull up at the mission.</i>
4521059 4524393 <i>The Angelus bell is ringing<br />for the arrival of the angel.</i>
4524479 4530270 <i>And the location is in Almería<br />near Los Albaricoques,</i>
4530359 4533067 <i>the village where the end of</i><br />For a Few Dollars More <i>was shot,</i>
4533154 4536863 <i>and it's called the Cortijo de Los Frailes,<br />"of the brothers."</i>
4536949 4541318 <i>It's a 19th century chateau<br />with a chapel and outhouses attached.</i>
4541412 4544575 <i>And it had a certain notoriety<br />because in the 1930s,</i>
4544665 4547783 <i>a young couple ran away<br />and hid in this chateau,</i>
4548461 4551795 <i>and Garcia Lorca,<br />the great Spanish playwright,</i>
4551881 4556170 <i>wrote a play called</i> Blood Wedding<br /><i>all about this elopement,</i>
4556260 4558922 <i>because it ended in tears.<br />The parents caught up with them</i>
4559013 4561721 <i>and the couple both got killed<br />in a vendetta.</i>
4561808 4564766 <i>And in historical fact<br />it actually took place in this building</i>
4564852 4568641 <i>which is now derelict,<br />but in this film it's used as the mission</i>
4568731 4572315 <i>which is also a war hospital<br />in San Antonio.</i>
4577949 4582284 <i>Just like the scene at the ranch<br />where Lee Van Cleef looked in</i>
4582370 4585112 <i>and saw some of the side effects of war,</i>
4585206 4588164 <i>here we have a mission<br />where the Franciscan Friars</i>
4588251 4591789 <i>are trying their best<br />to look after the carnage</i>
4591879 4594871 <i>that is caused in war,<br />but not doing too well.</i>
4595883 4599717 <i>The younger monk in these scenes<br />was played by Angelo Novi,</i>
4599804 4602796 <i>who was the stills photographer on</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
4602890 4605222 <i>And just as Carlo Simi, the designer,<br />had a cameo</i>
4605309 4607346 <i>in</i> For a Few Dollars More<br /><i>as the bank manager,</i>
4607436 4609302 <i>so the stills photographer had a cameo</i>
4609397 4612389 <i>on</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly<br /><i>as a friar.</i>
4613067 4615525 All right, put a fresh bandage on him.
4616904 4618645 Put him in my cell.
4619699 4621064 Easy.
4624245 4627203 -Out, soldier. Out you go. Come on.<br />-Look out for him, please.
4627290 4629281 He's like a brother to me.
4635089 4637000 Hey, Father, I...
4642680 4645638 <i>And just as we have had<br />the Angelus bell ringing</i>
4645725 4646931 <i>and a golden-haired angel,</i>
4647018 4649009 <i>and all sorts of<br />slightly mocking references</i>
4649103 4653597 <i>to Roman Catholicism and religion,<br />we are about to get a great Tuco moment</i>
4653691 4656274 <i>which is rather like the way<br />in which he crosses himself,</i>
4656360 4661196 <i>where he wants to be seen on his knees</i>
4661282 4664320 <i>before this image of Jesus,</i>
4664410 4666697 <i>opens his eye patch,<br />'cause both his eyes of course work,</i>
4666787 4670496 <i>Carson's eye patch, closes it down again,<br />makes sure no one is looking at him.</i>
4670583 4673166 <i>Maybe someone is watching,<br />so I'd better get on my knees,</i>
4673252 4677120 <i>swelling choral music, cross himself,</i>
4678174 4680290 <i>clasp his hands in prayer.</i>
4681427 4682883 <i>Apparently praying for Blondie,</i>
4682970 4686133 <i>but wants to make sure<br />that the Friars see him doing it.</i>
4688517 4692556 He's both young and strong.<br />That's what's kept him going until now.
4692647 4695059 He should regain his strength<br />in a very short time.
4695149 4697794 Thank you, Father. You don't know<br />how much this boy's life means to me.
4697818 4699900 Thanks be to Jesus. Thanks to all of you.
4705034 4708072 <i>But actually, there is<br />something else on Tuco's mind.</i>
4708162 4711530 <i>A slug of whiskey is probably going<br />to do the trick rather better</i>
4711624 4716414 <i>and a fly lands on his face at just<br />the right moment and he smiles.</i>
4716504 4720463 <i>Nice little trill on the soundtrack<br />as the firewater reaches his gut.</i>
4722260 4725252 <i>Tuco is a wonderful... He's a sort of<br />a carnival character in this film.</i>
4725346 4728259 <i>He plays the part of Sancho Panza</i>
4728349 4731887 <i>to Clint Eastwood's Knight<br />of the Rock-Hard Countenance.</i>
4731978 4734310 <i>And in the tradition of Italian<br />and Spanish literature</i>
4734397 4736263 <i>going right back to the Renaissance,</i>
4736357 4738974 <i>there was very often<br />this carnivalesque character</i>
4739068 4741605 <i>who ate a lot, who swore mightily,</i>
4741696 4744484 <i>who belched,<br />who represented the kind of life force</i>
4744573 4747531 <i>like Sancho Panza,<br />who was a clown in effect,</i>
4747618 4751361 <i>and was always contrasted<br />with the chivalric, rather hard,</i>
4751455 4754493 <i>slightly bloodless character,<br />the Don Quixote character,</i>
4754583 4758076 <i>which is the equivalent<br />of the Clint Eastwood character in this.</i>
4758170 4762164 <i>So really,<br />Eli Wallach is playing Sancho Panza</i>
4762258 4764340 <i>to Clint Eastwood's Don Quixote.</i>
4764427 4766509 <i>And it's a very Mediterranean character.</i>
4766595 4767835 <i>A very unbuttoned character.</i>
4767930 4770297 <i>It's not part of the<br />Hollywood tradition at all.</i>
4770391 4773133 <i>Umberto Eco, the philosopher,<br />referred to it as</i>
4773227 4777061 <i>the Renaissance looking back<br />with godless nostalgia,</i>
4777148 4778980 <i>to the great romps of medieval times,</i>
4779066 4781808 <i>only this time<br />instead of them being religious stories,</i>
4781902 4785020 <i>they were a form of clowning<br />and a rather more subversive form.</i>
4785114 4789153 <i>He called it, like other critics<br />of the time, carnivalesque,</i>
4789243 4793237 <i>and if ever there was a carnivalesque<br />character in this movie, it is Tuco.</i>
4795124 4797707 It's good to have somebody close by...
4797793 4799750 Friends or relations.
4800671 4803538 Do you have parents, Blondie?
4803632 4808217 <i>It is very unusual in a Leone film to have<br />any background to the characters.</i>
4808971 4812214 <i>In</i> Fistful of Dollars,<br /><i>there was in fact a bit of exposition</i>
4812308 4814675 <i>about the Man with No Name,<br />but it was cut,</i>
4814769 4816079 <i>and so we learn nothing about him.</i>
4816103 4818457 <i>He's a stranger that arrives<br />from nowhere that goes from nowhere.</i>
4818481 4820643 <i>We never understand anything<br />about his background,</i>
4820733 4824271 <i>and the same with the Eastwood character<br />in</i> For a Few Dollars More,
4824362 4827900 <i>although we know quite a lot about the<br />family background of Colonel Mortimer.</i>
4827990 4830948 <i>Well, in this film we learn<br />a little bit about the fact</i>
4831035 4833322 <i>that these two characters<br />are alone in the world.</i>
4833412 4837280 <i>At least Tuco says they are,<br />and he understands vulnerability</i>
4837375 4840493 <i>and he is brilliant at<br />exploiting vulnerability in others.</i>
4840586 4843374 <i>And he is beginning to show<br />a much wider range of emotions</i>
4843464 4846627 <i>than is usual in Leone characters.</i>
4846884 4849376 <i>In fact, Leone once said to me<br />that the three main characters,</i>
4849470 4850781 <i>this is slightly alarming actually,</i>
4850805 4854719 <i>but the three main characters in the film<br />represented parts of his own personality.</i>
4854809 4860725 <i>That Eastwood was the together,<br />professional, cautious side of his character</i>
4860815 4865855 <i>who made sure that there was an exit<br />before he moved into any situation,</i>
4865945 4872817 <i>that Tuco was the life-loving carnival<br />sort of anarchic side of his character,</i>
4872993 4874904 <i>and that the robotic side of his character,</i>
4874995 4876906 <i>which one hopes<br />wasn't too well developed,</i>
4876997 4879113 <i>was represented<br />by the Lee Van Cleef character.</i>
4879208 4882576 <i>But of all the characters, he said,<br />"The one I really love is the anarchist."</i>
4882670 4887085 <i>That Tuco was one of his favorite<br />characters in all the films that he made,</i>
4887174 4889541 <i>and he found him<br />a truly touching character,</i>
4889635 4892969 <i>when later on we do learn<br />about his family background</i>
4893055 4896014 <i>and Tuco tries to put a brave face on it.</i>
4896143 4898680 <i>"And at that point, " said Leone,<br />"he becomes truly touching."</i>
4898770 4900260 <i>And it is the anarchists,</i>
4900355 4904098 <i>the ones who don't really believe<br />in left or right in politics</i>
4904192 4908777 <i>but who get through life drinking a lot,<br />swearing a lot, and loving life a lot,</i>
4908864 4913859 <i>it's those, that's where Leone's heart lies<br />and it lies very firmly with Tuco.</i>
4917122 4919204 I'll always honor your memory.
4920208 4923371 I swear, I'll always honor your memory.
4926298 4930041 <i>And here is a wonderful moment of<br />slapstick amidst all the nasty makeup</i>
4930135 4932797 <i>and the carnage of war in<br />the room next door.</i>
4932888 4934720 <i>Is he gonna tell him?</i>
4934890 4937882 <i>No, he isn't.<br />He's just gonna throw water in his face.</i>
4942063 4943804 <i>It's best not to trust anybody.</i>
4943899 4945810 <i>Wonderful punctuation of the music again.</i>
4945901 4947687 <i>Just as each of the characters gets</i>
4947777 4950189 <i>a little phrase of the main title theme,</i>
4950280 4953238 <i>it comes in as kind of musical punctuation.</i>
4961249 4963206 <i>When</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly<br /><i>came out,</i>
4963293 4965910 <i>a famous review was written<br />in January, 1967,</i>
4966004 4969167 <i>by the Italian novelist Alberto Moravia,</i>
4969257 4972841 <i>where he said that the early<br />Italian Westerns were basically</i>
4972928 4975215 <i>trying to be copy Hollywood Westerns.</i>
4975305 4979219 <i>Cowboys and Indians<br />and Buffalo Bill, hero of the Far West.</i>
4979309 4982973 <i>And they resembled<br />American television movies.</i>
4983063 4986042 <i>And then he went on to say that,<br />of course, in Italy there was no Wild West.</i>
4986066 4990651 <i>There's no frontier, there's no<br />cowboys, there's no frontier towns.</i>
4990737 4993525 <i>So whereas Hollywood is about a myth,</i>
4993615 4998030 <i>Italian films are about a myth about a<br />myth based upon the viewing of movies.</i>
4998119 5000577 <i>So they are at one step removed from<br />the films themselves.</i>
5000664 5003031 <i>But he said with this film,</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,
5003124 5004364 <i>the Italianization,</i>
5004459 5007747 <i>the Mediterraneanization of<br />the Western was complete.</i>
5007837 5009293 <i>This is a Mediterranean movie.</i>
5009381 5012874 <i>A lot of its cultural reference points<br />are Mediterranean.</i>
5012968 5016836 <i>So it's taking the original Hollywood<br />idea of the American Civil War</i>
5016930 5019513 <i>and turning it into a Mediterranean movie.</i>
5019599 5022682 <i>And I think that's probably<br />a just thing to say.</i>
5022769 5027855 <i>Particularly in this sequence where Tuco<br />meets his brother, Padre Ramirez,</i>
5027941 5030558 <i>a riot of Roman Catholic iconography,</i>
5030652 5036489 <i>all these statues and baroque cherubs<br />lying around in the mission office.</i>
5037742 5042407 <i>And Ramirez was played<br />by Luigi Pistilli, who had played Groggy,</i>
5042497 5046912 <i>the last of the bandits to die<br />from Gian Maria Volontè's gang</i>
5047002 5048163 <i>in</i> For a Few Dollars More.
5048253 5051336 <i>The problem was he couldn't<br />speak a single word of English.</i>
5051423 5054632 <i>And Eli Wallach remembers having some<br />difficulty with this sequence,</i>
5054718 5061010 <i>'cause he's talking away in English but<br />Padre Ramirez is talking entirely in Italian.</i>
5061099 5062931 <i>It's my rare example in Leone's cinema</i>
5063018 5065931 <i>of getting some social background<br />to one of his characters.</i>
5066021 5071437 <i>We learn about a society where<br />the options open to young people</i>
5071526 5073938 <i>are either to become a bandit<br />or to become a priest.</i>
5074029 5077488 <i>A sort of third world society where<br />you go one way, or you go the other.</i>
5077574 5082319 <i>And Padre Ramirez went one way and<br />went into the church, a great employer,</i>
5082412 5085905 <i>and Tuco went the other<br />and became a bandit.</i>
5085999 5089367 <i>And Tuco's attempts to be family-minded</i>
5089461 5091668 <i>and to actually get a bit of jollity<br />into the occasion</i>
5091755 5095373 <i>and be brotherly are very<br />touching in this scene.</i>
5098136 5099968 Nine years?
5100055 5102763 <i>Italian critics at the time were<br />slightly worried about this scene.</i>
5102849 5104965 <i>They said that Leone was selling out,</i>
5105060 5108678 <i>that because a major American studio<br />had been involved in the film,</i>
5108772 5110433 <i>this was rather sentimental for Leone.</i>
5110523 5112981 <i>He had a very hard edge<br />in his first two films,</i>
5113068 5115025 Fistful of Dollars <i>and</i><br />For a Few Dollars More.
5115111 5119446 <i>And here was a slightly sentimental music<br />and a human relationship emerging,</i>
5119532 5121273 <i>a very different form of cinema.</i>
5121368 5124736 <i>You could equally argue against those<br />critics that it was Leone growing up.</i>
5124829 5127992 <i>He's actually getting interested in<br />the human side of his characters,</i>
5128083 5130186 <i>whereas in the early films<br />they are like grotesque puppets</i>
5130210 5131996 <i>from some Italian puppet show,</i>
5132087 5135500 <i>wandering through the puppet stage<br />somewhere in a Never-Never Land</i>
5135590 5138378 <i>in New Mexico and Texas,<br />but actually in Spain.</i>
5138468 5143178 <i>That at last he's getting interested<br />in the inner person with Tuco</i>
5143264 5145596 <i>and this scene tells you<br />an awful lot about him,</i>
5145684 5147684 <i>and actually enhances<br />the audience interest in him.</i>
5147727 5151015 <i>You learn nothing about Lee Van Cleef,<br />you learn nothing about Clint Eastwood.</i>
5151106 5153393 <i>Lee Van Cleef, in<br />fact, said in an interview</i>
5153483 5156851 <i>that because so much information<br />was given about Tuco,</i>
5156945 5160028 <i>the audience's sympathy went to him<br />and their interest went with him</i>
5160115 5162152 <i>and it loaded the dice in Tuco's favor.</i>
5162242 5165985 <i>It was the beginnings of a new form<br />of cinema for Sergio Leone</i>
5166079 5168696 <i>and some Italian critics<br />were muddied by this.</i>
5171543 5173343 <i>So suddenly they start<br />behaving like children.</i>
5173420 5175900 <i>They are trying to be mature grown-ups<br />talking about the family</i>
5175964 5180253 <i>and why hasn't Tuco been home and<br />mother died and father died recently.</i>
5180343 5182926 <i>But suddenly they are beginning<br />to lose their temper</i>
5183012 5185299 <i>and they are gonna scrap<br />like two children in a minute.</i>
5185807 5189391 You remember, when you left<br />to become a priest, I stayed behind.
5189477 5193345 I must have been ten, twelve.<br />I don't remember which, but I stayed.
5193440 5197980 I tried, but it was no good.<br />Now I will tell you something.
5198069 5203109 You became a priest because you were<br />too much of a coward to do what I do.
5205493 5206654 <i>So Tuco has provoked him.</i>
5206745 5210955 <i>So that they are gonna start scrapping.<br />They are gonna knock over those statues.</i>
5211040 5212920 <i>It's gonna end in tears,<br />it's like two children.</i>
5213001 5216915 <i>And Blondie's watching,<br />unbeknown to Tuco.</i>
5217005 5219372 <i>And it's important that he sees this</i>
5219466 5222174 <i>because it makes sense<br />of the subsequent scene.</i>
5226639 5230724 <i>And as a good Christian, Ramirez says,<br />"Please forgive me, brother."</i>
5233313 5235270 Please forgive me, brother.
5239444 5241481 <i>Camera goes along the horses as usual</i>
5241571 5246111 <i>to get to the point where they are getting<br />up onto the driver's seat of the coach.</i>
5246201 5249364 <i>The bell rings and off they go.</i>
5249454 5252788 <i>And this was the dialog which<br />Leone said convinced him</i>
5252874 5257084 <i>of just how touching<br />a character Tuco was.</i>
5257170 5261209 <i>'Cause Tuco pretends that everything is<br />all right with the family,</i>
5261299 5264087 <i>but Blondie knows it wasn't.</i>
5264385 5266501 Ah, my belly's full.
5268473 5270965 Nice guy, my brother.
5271059 5273391 I didn't tell you<br />my brother was in charge here?
5273478 5275594 Everything. Like the pope almost.
5275688 5279226 He's in charge in Rome.<br />Yeah, yeah my brother, he say to me...
5279317 5283026 "Stay, brother. Don't go home.<br />We never see each other."
5283112 5287606 "Here there's plenty to eat and drink.<br />Bring your friend too."
5287700 5292661 Whenever we see each other, he never<br />lets me go. It's always the same story.
5292747 5295455 My brother... he is crazy about me.
5299087 5303251 That's so. Even a tramp like me,<br />no matter what happens...
5304342 5309007 I know there's a brother somewhere<br />who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.
5310932 5312047 Sure.
5312350 5314261 <i>"Sure." He knows the truth.</i>
5314352 5317390 Well, after a meal,<br />there's nothing like a good cigar.
5319816 5323434 <i>So he hands him the cigar,<br />Tuco looks at it.</i>
5323528 5326896 <i>Does Eastwood know the truth?<br />Does it matter?</i>
5329951 5331011 <i>Let's get on with the story.</i>
5331035 5333715 <i>And there's a wonderful moment where<br />Tuco just reflects for a moment</i>
5333788 5336246 <i>and then hunches his shoulders</i>
5336332 5340371 <i>and the music tells you, "Come on,<br />let's get on with it. What the hell?"</i>
5340461 5343123 <i>It's a very subtle moment<br />between the two men.</i>
5353182 5355844 <i>And just in case we've forgotten<br />that we are in a war zone,</i>
5355935 5360145 <i>because now we are in March, April, 1862,</i>
5360231 5362222 <i>and the Battle of Glorieta has taken place,</i>
5362317 5365480 <i>and so there is a lot of carnage<br />around this part of the country.</i>
5367947 5371485 <i>There's a sequence here that was cut from<br />all the prints after the Italian release</i>
5371576 5373442 <i>and has only just been<br />put back 35 years later.</i>
5373536 5378451 <i>It has Tuco consulting a map to try<br />and find where Sad Hill Cemetery is.</i>
5378541 5383536 <i>And in a moment we will see all around<br />them, the remnants of the battle</i>
5383671 5388211 <i>that's taken place between Canby's Union<br />forces and Sibley's Confederate forces.</i>
5393181 5397596 <i>He looks to the side, we get the bugle<br />music of Morricone's Civil War theme,</i>
5397685 5401679 <i>and we are reminded, in case we had<br />forgotten in all the family background,</i>
5404776 5406392 <i>that we are in a battle zone.</i>
5406486 5409899 <i>And this is Clint Eastwood's voice<br />dubbed in 35 years later</i>
5409989 5412276 <i>and it's also Eli<br />Wallach's voice dubbed in.</i>
5412367 5414825 <i>So, together again at last.</i>
5417538 5421327 <i>And again, just in case we are thinking<br />that the characters are getting committed</i>
5421417 5423875 <i>by seeing all this carnage around them,</i>
5423962 5428251 <i>there's a wonderfully cynical moment<br />coming up about which side they're on.</i>
5428549 5431257 <i>Remember, they are dressed<br />as Confederates</i>
5431427 5435591 <i>and some troops are coming<br />and they look like Confederate troops.</i>
5435682 5439846 <i>And here's a gag that comes partly<br />from the Buster Keaton film</i> The General,
5440103 5443812 <i>where Buster Keaton is playing<br />a Union spy</i>
5443898 5446640 <i>who waves at his fellow Union troops,<br />but then suddenly remembers</i>
5446734 5450773 <i>he's dressed up in a Confederate uniform.<br />But it is also and more importantly</i>
5450863 5454572 <i>from an Ambrose Bierce short story<br />called</i> One of the Missing,
5454742 5457074 <i>which is a wonderful story about<br />the American Civil War</i>
5457161 5458651 <i>that Leone had read.</i>
5458830 5463791 <i>And it's a Union Private who is dying,<br />surrounded by lots of bodies.</i>
5464043 5467456 <i>And the last word of the story is<br />"The dust was so thick</i>"
5467547 5471040 <i>"on his Union uniform that<br />he could almost be a Confederate."</i>
5475596 5477396 <i>So the only thing that separates<br />the two sides</i>
5477432 5480675 <i>from the point of view of<br />our two heroes is a lot of dust.</i>
5484355 5489065 <i>Cut to all of them in lock step as<br />they go to a concentration camp.</i>
5489444 5493529 <i>And this was a huge shock also,<br />in the mid '60s, 'cause people knew</i>
5493614 5495696 <i>about Andersonville Concentration Camp</i>
5495783 5498775 <i>run by the Confederates<br />in Confederate Georgia,</i>
5498870 5503865 <i>where there were 32,000 inmates<br />and 13,000 of them died,</i>
5504042 5508206 <i>amidst starvation, lack of supplies<br />and even cannibalism.</i>
5508296 5510879 <i>And it was a major scandal<br />of the American Civil War.</i>
5510965 5514924 <i>And various attempts have been made<br />to make a movie out of Andersonville.</i>
5515011 5517343 <i>There was a famous novel called</i><br />Andersonville <i>in the 1950s,</i>
5517430 5521389 <i>and Stanley Kramer, the producer, was<br />gonna make a film with Fred Zinnemann</i>
5521476 5524559 <i>directing it, but it never happened.<br />It's too much of a downer.</i>
5524645 5528730 <i>I mean, it's a very, very nasty story.<br />But what was the shock in the mid '60s</i>
5528816 5532229 <i>was to see a concentration camp<br />associated with the winning side,</i>
5532320 5534120 <i>with the Northerners.<br />This isn't Andersonville</i>
5534155 5537819 <i>in Confederate Georgia,<br />this is Betterville in New Mexico,</i>
5538242 5541325 <i>Betterville Concentration Camp,<br />run by the North.</i>
5541496 5545865 <i>A wooden stockade with various<br />watchtowers, with big trenches</i>
5545958 5550794 <i>to take the dead, with no shelter for<br />the inmates except for the Union officers.</i>
5551089 5556755 <i>It's in fact based on a series of<br />steel engravings of Andersonville</i>
5557095 5560929 <i>dated August, 1864, which Carlo Simi,<br />the production designer, got hold of.</i>
5561015 5565009 <i>I've seen his reference materials<br />and he designed this based upon</i>
5565311 5567427 <i>the original Andersonville.</i>
5569607 5571348 <i>We've been introduced<br />to Corporal Wallace,</i>
5571442 5574230 <i>the man calling the role,<br />who is played by Mario Brega,</i>
5574320 5580111 <i>the Roman actor who appeared as Chico,<br />the bad guy in</i> A Fistful of Dollars,
5580201 5583114 <i>and was also one of Indio's gang<br />in</i> For a Few Dollars More.
5583204 5587198 <i>Well, he plays Corporal Wallace,<br />an even more unpleasant character.</i>
5587333 5589495 <i>And we're now being introduced<br />to Captain Harper</i>
5589585 5591747 <i>who is the Betterville Camp Commandant,</i>
5591838 5597174 <i>played by the actor Antonio Molino Rojo<br />in a kind of makeup</i>
5597260 5600548 <i>that makes it look as though<br />he is at death's door.</i>
5600721 5604430 <i>And he really leads us forward to<br />the character of Mr. Morton</i>
5604517 5607930 <i>in</i> Once Upon a Time in the West,<br /><i>the man running the shop</i>
5608020 5613186 <i>who is also seriously disabled and dying,<br />but has a sense of mission.</i>
5613651 5616518 <i>It's just that time is running out for him.</i>
5618406 5620738 <i>And this brings<br />the three characters together.</i>
5620825 5625410 <i>Remember that Van Cleef, Sentenza,<br />Angel Eyes, has found out</i>
5625580 5629073 <i>that Carson might be<br />in Betterville Concentration Camp.</i>
5630209 5632917 <i>So there he is on the left<br />with his back to us.</i>
5634589 5637067 <i>Carson's name is called,<br />and this is what he's been waiting for.</i>
5637091 5640254 <i>He has enlisted in the Union Army,<br />gone to Betterville Concentration Camp</i>
5640344 5644338 <i>precisely to meet Carson 'cause he thinks<br />Carson knows the secret of the gold.</i>
5644432 5647140 <i>And at last the three of them<br />come together.</i>
5647226 5649137 <i>Van Cleef knows about Carson,</i>
5649228 5652721 <i>Eastwood knows the name on the grave,<br />Tuco knows where the graveyard is.</i>
5652815 5655307 <i>These three guys have got to get together.</i>
5655401 5657642 Yeah, that's me.
5666287 5668324 Please, Carson...
5669582 5671368 answer "present."
5673044 5674955 What are you, deaf?
5680009 5684219 <i>Mario Brega's specialty was playing<br />characters that punched people like that.</i>
5684305 5687388 <i>Only this time he's been given<br />a bad eye, in keeping with</i>
5687475 5690843 <i>all the dismemberment and disability<br />that's all surrounding him,</i>
5690937 5694555 <i>as a symbol of the war.<br />Wallace's left eye seems to have</i>
5694649 5697085 <i>lost its pupil and he's got a scar<br />running through the middle of it.</i>
5697109 5698725 <i>Great piece of makeup.</i>
5701906 5702987 Sergeant!
5703074 5705736 <i>Remember, too,<br />that a very successful film in Europe</i>
5705826 5707988 <i>had recently been</i> The Great Escape.
5708079 5711947 <i>And there's one or two shots<br />in the way that Betterville is filmed</i>
5712041 5715579 <i>which are taken from John Sturges' film</i><br />The Great Escape.
5715670 5718662 <i>A shot that's coming up of<br />the inmates looking wistfully through</i>
5718756 5724001 <i>the stockade at the wilderness beyond<br />and thinking, "Is it worth escaping?"</i>
5724220 5728179 <i>Which are very similar to<br />an equivalent shot in</i> The Great Escape.
5728724 5731136 <i>Instead of motorbikes it's horses.</i>
5734522 5736763 For the last time, Sergeant...
5737233 5741443 I'm telling you, I want the prisoners<br />treated as prisoners.
5742238 5744070 No more brutality.
5745074 5748783 There's hundreds of prisoners out there<br />and only a few men to guard them.
5748869 5750530 <i>Which was the issue in Andersonville.</i>
5750621 5754034 <i>That when the trial took place of those<br />who were responsible for Andersonville,</i>
5754125 5757117 <i>the defense was<br />the supply lines weren't good enough,</i>
5757211 5761375 <i>there wasn't enough staff to run it<br />and so the only substitute for</i>
5761590 5766460 <i>proper resourcing was extreme brutality.<br />And Commandant Wirtz, who was the man</i>
5766554 5771299 <i>in charge of it, always claimed that<br />that was the problem.</i>
5771392 5774976 <i>He was under-resourced so he had to<br />be sadistic in order to keep order.</i>
5775062 5779397 <i>It was a very similar argument, but it had<br />never been applied to the Union side.</i>
5781569 5784812 I know there's scum around<br />who are bivouacked near the camp...
5784905 5788148 waiting for someone to deliver this loot.
5788242 5793203 But as long as I'm commandant, I won't<br />permit any such trickery. Am I clear?
5795416 5796998 Yes, sir...
5797084 5799416 just as long as you're the commandant.
5800129 5803212 <i>Very nasty again,<br />Van Cleef at his most sneery.</i>
5803299 5806212 <i>The man with the gunsight eyes,<br />"Just so long as you are Commandant,"</i>
5806302 5810341 <i>which isn't going to be very long and then<br />the safety catch will be completely off,</i>
5810431 5812513 <i>and the Bad can do what he likes.</i>
5813601 5815808 ...and bring to a court-martial...
5815895 5818478 all those who discredit and dishonor...
5818564 5821226 the uniform of the Union.
5826447 5827447 I wish you luck.
5827531 5829363 <i>"I wish you luck," a very cynical line.</i>
5829450 5832533 <i>I want to bring in anyone who brings<br />discredit to the Union.</i>
5832620 5834657 <i>"Well," says the Van Cleef character,</i>
5834747 5836475 <i>"goodness knows how<br />you're going to do that."</i>
5836499 5839912 <i>A very mid-'60s sentiment about idealism.</i>
5840878 5843461 <i>That whole sequence<br />of the Camp Commandant</i>
5843547 5848166 <i>was in fact cut from the British print,<br />which went down to 148 minutes</i>
5848260 5851594 <i>on first release.<br />And we lost the gunsmith, we lost</i>
5851680 5855799 <i>this sequence in the concentration camp<br />and we lost various other trims,</i>
5855893 5858601 <i>to take it down from three hours<br />to 148 minutes.</i>
5858854 5862643 <i>But that's an important piece of<br />context, both about the Civil War</i>
5862733 5865976 <i>and about the kind of moral ambiguities<br />that are surrounding this story.</i>
5866070 5868732 <i>There are good people,<br />they're fighting the good fight,</i>
5868823 5870814 <i>but it's an uphill struggle.</i>
5874286 5879747 <i>Two of Van Cleef's gang who are part<br />of this scam, stealing from the prisoners,</i>
5880167 5884081 <i>were played by Aldo Sambrell<br />and Benito Stefanelli,</i>
5884171 5887709 <i>who were regular hard men for Leone<br />in his first two films.</i>
5887800 5891885 <i>In fact Stefanelli was a stunt coordinator<br />and stunt director as well,</i>
5892096 5894133 <i>which he was on this film.</i>
5895224 5898091 <i>So, to the strains of<br />Morricone's Civil War lament,</i>
5898185 5904181 <i>one of his three Civil War themes,<br />the bad guys decide to lay low.</i>
5904692 5907980 <i>And in fact we are about to have<br />the one piece of music</i>
5908821 5911188 <i>that's justified by the story,<br />actually internal music</i>
5911532 5914615 <i>which relates to the story.<br />Remember, in</i> For a Few Dollars More
5914702 5917364 <i>there's the chiming watch and in</i><br />Once Upon a Time in the West
5917455 5921494 <i>there's a harmonica where a main<br />musical theme is justified by the story.</i>
5921917 5925126 <i>Now, what's coming up is<br />the concentration camp orchestra,</i>
5925212 5930082 <i>which will play a soldier's lament,<br />a Confederate lament to hide</i>
5930551 5935796 <i>the sound of the brutality that's going on<br />inside this room, as Tuco is beaten up</i>
5936182 5940551 <i>to give the information to Lee Van Cleef<br />about where the gold is hidden.</i>
5940895 5943353 <i>So the theme,</i> The Ballad of the Soldier,
5943439 5945931 <i>which we've had reference to<br />on the soundtrack,</i>
5946025 5948392 <i>will now become a vocal theme</i>
5950070 5952437 <i>with a choir singing it on the soundtrack.</i>
5952531 5955694 <i>It's in fact the only song<br />with English words</i>
5955784 5958572 <i>that was ever to appear in a Leone film.</i>
5960080 5964495 <i>More eating. We've had the soup,<br />we've had the corn on the cob, we've had</i>
5964585 5969295 <i>the chicken, we've had the potatoes,<br />and now we go back to "eat the minister."</i>
5972426 5974087 <i>Whiskey and minestrone.</i>
5977097 5979555 "I'll bet he got himself an easy job..."
5982937 5984894 "And he never forgets a friend."
5985940 5988102 I never forget old friends, Tuco.
5988692 5991980 <i>In a lot of Italian Westerns, 'cause<br />subsequently after his success in this film</i>
5992071 5995780 <i>Lee Van Cleef stayed for<br />many more Westerns in Italy,</i>
5995866 5999780 <i>in the late '60s and early '70s,<br />he was often to wear a toupee</i>
5999954 6003447 <i>to make himself look younger<br />and more of the action hero.</i>
6003749 6006958 <i>But in this movie it's<br />Van Cleef's real hair.</i>
6007044 6012164 <i>He was a veteran actor in Hollywood<br />who had been around since the early '50s</i>
6012258 6015125 <i>and Leone wanted him to look like that.</i>
6017805 6021298 Well, if you were with Sibley,<br />that means then that you...
6022309 6026553 <i>His carnival character is eating as if<br />it's his last meal, which it well might be,</i>
6026647 6030390 <i>but he's really shoveling it down<br />and wants another drink as well.</i>
6030651 6035020 <i>Sancho Panza's belly is empty.<br />In fact, Eli Wallach went on to play</i>
6035114 6040405 <i>Sancho Panza in a version of</i> Don Quixote<br /><i>on American television.</i>
6040494 6043953 <i>And the character was one of<br />his personal favorites as well.</i>
6046166 6050581 <i>And if you look closely at Eli<br />Wallach's lips in this speech in a moment</i>
6050671 6056417 <i>about Angel Eyes, you'll see that he's<br />in fact saying Sentenza, not Angel Eyes.</i>
6056510 6060174 <i>So when the film was shot,<br />Van Cleef was still known as Sentenza.</i>
6060264 6064849 <i>It was only when the dubbing occurred<br />into English that Angel Eyes came along.</i>
6065603 6067389 Sergeant Angel Eyes.
6073694 6075935 <i>And of course,<br />the orchestra playing outside</i>
6076030 6078647 <i>is not just a reference to<br />the American Civil War,</i>
6078741 6081950 <i>but is a reference to Auschwitz<br />and concentration camps</i>
6082036 6085700 <i>in the Second World War where precisely<br />camp orchestras played</i>
6085873 6090288 <i>in order to hide<br />the cries of the condemned.</i>
6092087 6094795 <i>So a European audience would have<br />picked up on this reference.</i>
6094882 6096192 <i>In fact there are lots of references,</i>
6096216 6101131 <i>not just to the American Civil War but<br />to the First World War, the Céline book</i>
6101221 6104634 <i>and the film</i> La Grande guerra,<br /><i>but later on there will be references</i>
6104725 6107262 <i>to the Second World War as well with<br />the Battle of the Bridge.</i>
6107353 6109581 <i>So, yes, it's the American Civil War,<br />but it's also a statement</i>
6109605 6113018 <i>about the whole of warfare.<br />It's a kind of surreal fusion</i>
6113192 6116435 <i>of different historical wars from<br />the 1860s onwards.</i>
6118405 6119987 <i>So here's the snuffbox again</i>
6120074 6123192 <i>that was first discovered<br />in that Confederate ambulance.</i>
6125579 6128867 <i>And the song begins with<br />the Confederate orchestra.</i>
6129625 6132617 <i>The words for the song,</i><br />The Ballad of the Soldier,
6132878 6137088 <i>were written by a British songwriter<br />called Tommy Connor.</i>
6137591 6140674 <i>Now I hate to lower the tone,<br />but Tommy Connor was the man</i>
6140761 6144470 <i>who wrote the deathless number</i><br />I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.
6144556 6148595 <i>And he also wrote the English words<br />for the German Propaganda song</i>
6148686 6151769 Lili Marlene, <i>which was made famous<br />by Marlene Dietrich.</i>
6151855 6155018 <i>So, it is extremely bizarre that<br />a songwriter who did the English words</i>
6155109 6157191 <i>for</i> Lili Marlene<br /><i>should be writing the words</i>
6157277 6161145 <i>for the concentration camp orchestra<br />in</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
6164993 6168952 <i>Looking just like a photograph<br />by Mathew Brady.</i>
6170124 6175290 <i>And cutting to this shot that almost<br />could have come from</i> The Great Escape,
6175879 6178962 <i>of them all standing there looking outward<br />through the stockade.</i>
6179049 6181882 <i>There was in fact some dialog here<br />originally in the shooting script,</i>
6181969 6183425 <i>but they cut it.</i>
6189601 6192844 <i>So Wallace is the hard guy who comes in</i>
6193897 6197310 <i>and beats up Tuco to Angel Eyes' orders.</i>
6198819 6201402 <i>Again this was trimmed<br />when the film first came out,</i>
6201488 6207450 <i>just as the attack on Maria the prostitute<br />was cut because of excessive brutality.</i>
6208412 6211825 <i>It's a very nasty scene which<br />goes on just a little bit too long</i>
6211915 6216000 <i>and Van Cleef smiling that half-smile<br />as he watches.</i>
6217171 6219708 <i>There is a lot of torture in Leone's films.</i>
6219798 6222916 <i>You know, Dr. Villega being tortured<br />in</i> Duck, You Sucker,
6224052 6227841 <i>and other characters being tortured<br />in</i> For a Few Dollars More.
6227973 6231841 <i>And his whole idea of torture,<br />Leone once said, goes back to</i>
6231935 6236680 <i>those movies made in 1944 and 1945<br />about collaboration with the Nazis</i>
6236774 6240938 <i>in the Second World War.</i> Rome, Open City<br /><i>which has a famous scene</i>
6241028 6245113 <i>where someone is tortured at<br />the SS headquarters on the Via Tasso</i>
6245199 6248282 <i>in Rome to give away<br />details of the Underground,</i>
6248368 6252202 <i>and doesn't do so and gets shot at dawn.<br />And you know,</i>
6252289 6256499 <i>there were a lot of memories in the Italian<br />film industry of those who fought</i>
6256585 6260044 <i>for the Resistance in the Second World<br />War and some of those went on to make</i>
6260130 6263213 <i>Italian Westerns where themes<br />of the Resistance come through.</i>
6263300 6268466 <i>Like Giulio Questi's</i> Django Kill<br /><i>where Questi, the director, claimed</i>
6268555 6272093 <i>there were all sorts of direct references<br />to the Resistance in the hills</i>
6272184 6276303 <i>above Nazi-occupied Rome<br />and those who didn't join the Resistance</i>
6276772 6280686 <i>and who were thought perhaps to have<br />collaborated or to have worked</i>
6280776 6282892 <i>too readily under the Nazi regime.</i>
6282986 6285353 <i>So this idea of torture,<br />will you crack under torture,</i>
6285447 6288189 <i>would you talk,<br />would you give away your colleagues,</i>
6288283 6291902 <i>went very, very deep<br />in Italian film culture in the 1960s.</i>
6292121 6294738 <i>And again audiences would have<br />picked up on this.</i>
6294833 6299418 <i>It isn't just the American Civil War,<br />what's being enacted is that other war</i>
6299712 6302670 <i>when the Nazis came into Rome,<br />when the Allies were bombing Rome</i>
6302757 6306591 <i>and where American soldiers had landed<br />at Salerno and were marching north.</i>
6306678 6308168 <i>Leone remembered all those things</i>
6308263 6310675 <i>and they come through<br />in these sequences.</i>
6317730 6323191 <i>A touching shot of a Confederate boy<br />crying as he plays this</i> Ballad of a Soldier
6323278 6327192 <i>and because he can hear what's<br />going on inside the room.</i>
6327949 6329690 Play that fiddle, you!
6331911 6333367 <i>"Play that fiddle."</i>
6339294 6341501 <i>He certainly found<br />some hungry-looking extras</i>
6341588 6344706 <i>to play the choir and Confederate band.</i>
6347969 6352554 <i>And Eli Wallach has recalled having<br />a discussion with Mario Brega</i>
6352640 6356429 <i>about the finer points of how to deal<br />with a scene like this.</i>
6356519 6362185 <i>In particular, applying finger pressure<br />just on the temples in order to have</i>
6362483 6366226 <i>maximum effect<br />on sobering someone up in that way.</i>
6366696 6369734 <i>So the idea is Tuco gives<br />Mario Brega a seminar</i>
6369824 6373317 <i>on how to be a sadist,<br />he looks as though he doesn't need it.</i>
6386174 6388290 What did he say about the money?
6388968 6392552 <i>The whole point is that Tuco knows<br />the name of the cemetery,</i>
6392639 6394450 <i>but he literally doesn't know<br />the name on the grave,</i>
6394474 6396556 <i>so it's not a matter of<br />whether he's tough or not.</i>
6396643 6399101 <i>He actually hasn't got the information.</i>
6399187 6401144 Sad Hill Cemetery.
6401230 6403346 <i>"Sad Hill Cemetery."</i>
6404484 6405849 Which grave?
6406903 6410521 I don't know. I don't know, I tell you.
6411282 6413282 <i>And you can tell from<br />Van Cleef's facial expression</i>
6413368 6415575 <i>he believes Tuco<br />when he says he doesn't know.</i>
6415662 6417494 <i>It's not a matter of holding out</i>
6417580 6420993 <i>'cause he knows that Tuco's spirit<br />has been broken.</i>
6421084 6423496 <i>So he's gonna have to deal with Blondie.</i>
6429550 6432042 <i>So Blondie comes in,<br />in his Confederate uniform,</i>
6432136 6436050 <i>and has thrown at him the costume<br />that he will wear in</i> A Fistful of Dollars
6436140 6439849 <i>and</i> For a Few Dollars More.<br /><i>His denim shirt, his sheepskin waistcoat,</i>
6439936 6442644 <i>his shrunk-to-fit jeans.<br />That trademark costume</i>
6442730 6446473 <i>of the Man with No Name is thrown<br />at him courtesy of Lee Van Cleef.</i>
6446567 6451607 <i>So that's where he got it and he's gonna<br />wear it for the rest of this movie as well.</i>
6451739 6455198 -Where?<br />-To find $200,000.
6455576 6456782 <i>"For you the war is over."</i>
6456869 6460407 <i>This, of course, was almost a parody line<br />even in the mid-1960s</i>
6460581 6463699 <i>and the kind of thing you got in bad<br />Second World War movies where</i>
6463793 6466911 <i>the Nazi commandant would say,<br />"For you the war is over."</i>
6467046 6470209 <i>Well, Lee Van Cleef says it<br />with a straight face.</i>
6481769 6484727 You're not gonna give me<br />the same treatment?
6488568 6490150 Would you talk?
6491279 6492986 No, probably not.
6494824 6496314 That's what I thought.
6497368 6499484 Not that you're any tougher than Tuco...
6499579 6501682 but you're smart enough to know<br />that talking won't save you.
6501706 6503434 <i>"You're smart enough to know that<br />talking won't save you."</i>
6503458 6505936 <i>So it's not in the end a matter of<br />toughness, which is just as well,</i>
6505960 6509999 <i>because Blondie has shown that he isn't<br />in fact as physically tough as Tuco.</i>
6510339 6514048 <i>It's a matter of knowing that<br />he's gonna get shot anyway,</i>
6514135 6516376 <i>so why should he give away<br />the information?</i>
6516471 6518803 <i>He knows just how bad Lee Van Cleef is.</i>
6518890 6522053 You've changed partners,<br />but you still got the same deal.
6522143 6524475 I'm not greedy. I'm only taking half.
6524562 6527020 <i>So he gets back his gun belt from</i> Rawhide
6527815 6531183 <i>and gets back<br />his Man with No Name outfit.</i>
6534864 6536104 Yeah.
6543164 6547249 <i>And as Tuco and Corporal Wallace<br />walk to the railway station</i>
6547335 6552330 <i>which was filmed at La Calahorra, near<br />Guadix in Spain, exactly the same location</i>
6552423 6554664 <i>as the opening sequence of</i><br />Once Upon a Time in the West.
6554759 6559925 <i>And in fact, Flagstone, the town<br />in</i> Once Upon a Time in the West
6560014 6564053 <i>was built about 300 yards away from<br />the railway line.</i>
6564310 6566096 <i>We actually go past Mathew Brady</i>
6566187 6568770 <i>taking a Civil War photo<br />of all these Union officers</i>
6568856 6572144 <i>in their Sunday best.<br />So if we hadn't got the references,</i>
6572235 6574192 <i>and there are many, many references</i>
6574278 6576519 <i>to the Civil War photographs<br />of Mathew Brady</i>
6576614 6581529 <i>and Alexander Gardner, there was another<br />example of a real historical figure,</i>
6581702 6585320 <i>unusually in a Leone film,<br />just to nudge us in that direction.</i>
6585706 6588664 <i>During the rest of the movie and in<br />particular the Battle of the Bridge,</i>
6588751 6591789 <i>there'll be various setups that could<br />almost have been taken</i>
6591879 6594246 <i>from Mathew Brady portfolios of photos,</i>
6594549 6599510 <i>taken at Antietam and Gettysburg<br />and the carnage on the battlefield.</i>
6599846 6603464 <i>There are a couple of moments which are<br />taken directly from those photographers.</i>
6603558 6607552 <i>And it almost comes as a surprise to<br />see Clint Eastwood walking into them.</i>
6607645 6609056 If I ever get you down...
6609647 6611979 you're gonna need a lot of help<br />to get up again.
6612066 6613977 <i>So, he's about to be thumped,</i>
6614777 6615892 <i>train whistle saves him.</i>
6615987 6618854 <i>That's the third time that a moment<br />in the war</i>
6619240 6621322 <i>has come and saved their skin.</i>
6621409 6623525 <i>There is the mortar in the hotel,</i>
6623703 6625764 <i>there is the Confederate ambulance<br />and now the train.</i>
6625788 6628200 <i>So he's not gonna get thumped<br />to pulp by Wallace,</i>
6628291 6630532 <i>he is gonna get on the train.</i>
6630668 6633035 <i>And on the front of the train is</i>
6634589 6637672 <i>a Confederate spy<br />strapped to the cowcatcher.</i>
6637758 6640090 And there isn't any partner this time to<br />shoot you down.
6649604 6653939 <i>Always these locomotive scenes were<br />made in and around Guadix and Calahorra</i>
6654150 6657438 <i>because the main Guadix-Almería railway<br />line ran there</i>
6657778 6659673 <i>and it was a matter of getting the engines<br />from Guadix,</i>
6659697 6662155 <i>dressing them up to look like<br />Wild West engines,</i>
6662241 6666405 <i>getting the rolling stock and<br />putting them on that main railway line.</i>
6670625 6675586 <i>And as the train pulls out there is a very<br />detailed moment which is very Leone,</i>
6675671 6678413 <i>where there is a mortar<br />on the back of the train</i>
6679634 6683002 <i>surrounded by a wooden cage to protect it</i>
6683095 6687305 <i>which again looks as though it's either<br />taken from an archive photo or perhaps</i>
6687391 6691476 <i>from Buster Keaton's</i> The General,<br /><i>which itself was based on a close viewing</i>
6691771 6694263 <i>of the armaments<br />of the American Civil War.</i>
6699070 6703314 <i>This sequence just coming up was<br />in Italian prints when it was distributed</i>
6703407 6706695 <i>but was cut from the American prints,<br />and certainly from British prints,</i>
6706786 6709494 <i>and was only put back 35 years later.</i>
6709789 6714909 <i>It's Lee Van Cleef bivouacking<br />with the strange sound of these birds</i>
6715002 6719963 <i>in the background, and it introduces us<br />a bit to his gang of hard men,</i>
6720174 6722211 <i>whom we've only seen<br />in medium shot up to now</i>
6722301 6723403 <i>and haven't really been introduced to.</i>
6723427 6727466 <i>Although Italians would notice<br />their names on the credits.</i>
6728933 6733177 <i>So you got Blondie half-asleep,<br />but not realty sleeping,</i>
6734355 6737643 <i>and Lee Van Cleef<br />The camera goes from one to the other.</i>
6737733 6739940 <i>Blondie has his hand on his gun all night.</i>
6740027 6743986 <i>Hears a sound, shoots as one of<br />Van Cleef's men walks up to him.</i>
6747576 6751865 <i>Van Cleef doesn't seem to mind at all,<br />his men are completely expendable.</i>
6751956 6754116 <i>If they come up too silently,<br />that's what they deserve.</i>
6754166 6756624 <i>So that tells us something about Van Cleef</i>
6756711 6758543 <i>and the others come out of hiding.</i>
6758629 6761462 <i>And we get a close-up<br />of each of them to introduce us</i>
6761549 6764667 <i>to Van Cleef's gang of carpetbaggers.</i>
6764760 6766738 <i>This is the only moment<br />where we actually meet them.</i>
6766762 6770221 <i>In the prints that circulated<br />in America and Britain from 1968,</i>
6770308 6772265 <i>we never were introduced<br />to these characters.</i>
6772351 6775560 <i>Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli,</i>
6775646 6779890 <i>all of them well know<br />from Leone's earlier films.</i>
6781652 6784519 Six... Perfect number.
6786115 6788322 Isn't three the perfect number?
6790077 6792444 <i>So we have a sound alike for Lee Van Cleef</i>
6792538 6796406 <i>and we have Clint Eastwood<br />dubbing his own part 35 years later.</i>
6800880 6802357 <i>Train whistle to show<br />that they're near the railway line</i>
6802381 6808172 <i>and to link with Eli Wallach<br />on his journey to prison.</i>
6826572 6830531 <i>Union troops are now victorious.<br />Sibley has been repulsed at Glorieta</i>
6830868 6832779 <i>and other smaller engagements,</i>
6832912 6837031 <i>and is on his way busily retreating out of<br />New Mexico back into Texas</i>
6837124 6838535 <i>with huge loss of life.</i>
6838626 6840708 <i>So instead of the first half of the film</i>
6840795 6843708 <i>where Sibley's troops are pouring into<br />New Mexico,</i>
6843798 6847007 <i>what we would get now<br />is a sense of Union troops fighting back</i>
6847093 6849710 <i>and pushing him into the desert.</i>
6849804 6855766 <i>So this is a Union troop train<br />working for Canby against Sibley's forces.</i>
6856977 6858330 Sure would like to put<br />your paw on it, huh?
6858354 6861597 <i>Nobody goes to sleep in a Leone film.<br />You always keep a weather eye open,</i>
6861690 6864398 <i>in case someone's going to steal<br />your armament when you're asleep.</i>
6864485 6869480 <i>Nobody trusts anyone.<br />It has the atmosphere of a Looney Tune</i>
6869573 6872782 <i>or a Warner Brothers cartoon where there<br />is absolutely an atmosphere</i>
6872868 6874404 <i>like Tom and Jerry or Bugs Bunny.</i>
6874495 6876827 <i>There is no sense of trust<br />between the characters at all.</i>
6876914 6879372 <i>It's a matter of<br />who's gonna get the upper hand</i>
6879458 6881561 <i>and who's gonna have the edge<br />and when are they going to have it.</i>
6881585 6884247 <i>It has a cartoon-like quality,<br />the lack of trust.</i>
6884338 6886921 <i>Like cats, nobody closes<br />their eyes properly.</i>
6889844 6892336 <i>And Tuco eats messily,</i>
6892430 6896264 <i>he swears, and on this occasion<br />he's peeing out of the side of the train,</i>
6896350 6898637 <i>which is a scene<br />that wasn't characteristic of the West.</i>
6898727 6900263 <i>And I think it may have been a first,</i>
6900354 6903722 <i>but he is using it<br />as a way of pulling Wallace off the train.</i>
6905317 6907308 <i>Again this was trimmed, this moment</i>
6907403 6909043 <i>where he bangs his head<br />against the stone.</i>
6909113 6911980 <i>That was taken out of British prints<br />for censorship reasons.</i>
6912074 6915112 <i>The brutality was thought to be<br />a little bit too much.</i>
6920916 6923453 <i>And a famous moment now is coming up</i>
6923669 6929631 <i>which was originally derived from<br />the Buster Keaton film</i> Our Hospitality,
6929925 6934590 <i>where Buster Keaton is roped to,<br />playing a character called McKay,</i>
6934763 6939007 <i>is roped to the bad guy and he drapes<br />the rope over the railway line</i>
6939101 6941968 <i>and waits for the early steam locomotive<br />to go over the rope</i>
6942062 6943518 <i>to separate him from the bad guy.</i>
6943606 6945142 <i>Well, this is a variation on that.</i>
6945232 6948896 <i>They are handcuffed together and the<br />handcuffs were made of soft lead</i>
6948986 6950977 <i>and it was draped over the railway line</i>
6951071 6953813 <i>and Tuco waits for the next train<br />to cut through them.</i>
6953908 6956570 <i>It's the only way of cutting himself loose.</i>
6956660 6959994 <i>And Wallach remembers<br />making this scene because</i>
6960080 6961866 <i>it very nearly got quite unpleasant.</i>
6961957 6964186 <i>There they are lying,<br />there is Wallace on the railway line,</i>
6964210 6968454 <i>there is Tuco, there's the soft lead of<br />the handcuffs between them.</i>
6968547 6970333 <i>And Leone wanted the train to come along</i>
6970424 6973007 <i>and he wanted everyone to know<br />that it wasn't a stuntman</i>
6973093 6975630 <i>who was actually lying by the railway line.</i>
6975721 6979180 <i>So he kept saying to Eli Wallach,<br />"Turn towards the audience</i>"
6979266 6982679 <i>"and make sure<br />that your head is well in shot,"</i>
6982770 6986013 <i>and Wallach noticed that slung underneath<br />the railway carriages</i>
6986106 6988518 <i>were some metal steps<br />that were narrowly missing his head</i>
6988609 6990475 <i>and that if he did put his head any higher</i>
6990569 6994528 <i>he would in fact have it banged very badly<br />and possibly fatally.</i>
6994615 6998574 <i>But, "No, let's do it again," said Leone,<br />and eventually they did agree to do it again,</i>
6998661 7001323 <i>but only if they dug a hole for Wallach<br />to go in</i>
7001413 7004326 <i>so his head wouldn't be sticking up<br />too much.</i>
7004416 7008705 <i>And he lives to fight another day. And<br />a remarkable shot. Takes off his jacket,</i>
7008796 7012630 <i>gets back on the train without<br />the train even slowing down.</i>
7012800 7019718 <i>So Tuco is back on his journey,<br />and a bit of Morricone punctuation</i>
7019807 7022299 <i>to remind us<br />of what a slapstick moment it was.</i>
7024019 7027228 <i>Now most of the towns<br />we've encountered in this film,</i>
7027356 7029313 <i>very often parts of Carlo Simi's set</i>
7029400 7033109 <i>in Tabernas in Almería,<br />were in quite good nick.</i>
7033195 7036404 <i>But we are now going to be introduced<br />to a town that's been flattened</i>
7036490 7039699 <i>by the retreating Confederates<br />and the advancing Northern troops.</i>
7039785 7045576 <i>It's the town of Peralta,<br />and this sequence was in fact shot</i>
7045666 7049534 <i>north of Madrid at a place called<br />Colmenar Viejo,</i>
7049628 7051665 <i>which was a standing Western set.</i>
7051755 7054497 <i>Here we have,<br />to match the Confederate spy</i>
7054592 7058210 <i>on the front of the cowcatcher, a looter,</i>
7058304 7060591 <i>who is about to be shot<br />by a makeshift firing squad.</i>
7060681 7063764 <i>He brings his own coffin to the party,<br />he gets shot.</i>
7063851 7066809 <i>So these are little vignettes of moments<br />in the Civil War.</i>
7066895 7071105 <i>There isn't much glory and chivalry there.<br />There's looting, the spying,</i>
7071191 7074434 <i>there is dismemberment and<br />that's the kind of stuff you get in battle.</i>
7074528 7077816 <i>But the troops are moving<br />through this town of Peralta</i>
7077990 7080527 <i>and the set had in fact been there<br />for some time.</i>
7080618 7084486 <i>It was known in the trade as<br />Aberdeen City, the set,</i>
7084580 7086446 <i>and it was made for a Raoul Walsh film</i>
7086540 7090283 <i>called</i> The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw<br /><i>which is a very rare British Western</i>
7090377 7093290 <i>that had been made a few years before<br />with Kenneth More as the sheriff</i>
7093380 7095792 <i>and Jayne Mansfield as the saloon girl.</i>
7095883 7099626 <i>And the set was standing<br />at Colmenar Viejo, north of Madrid,</i>
7099720 7103213 <i>quite near where</i> Fistful of Dollars<br /><i>was shot, and Carlo Simi,</i>
7103307 7107517 <i>the production designer, did a series<br />of drawings, distressing the entire set,</i>
7107603 7109970 <i>turning it into matchwood and rubble</i>
7110064 7112852 <i>and a town<br />which had been under mortar fire.</i>
7112941 7116354 <i>So what you've got is a town that's<br />been bombarded from all sides.</i>
7116445 7121861 <i>The shell of a town, a refugee town,<br />which has a rather modern ring to it.</i>
7121950 7126035 <i>And they've got to get through this town<br />in order to get to Sad Hill Cemetery.</i>
7131377 7135871 <i>Reintroduced to Tuco, he's got off<br />his train, he's made it to Peralta.</i>
7135964 7137875 <i>So Blondie is in Peralta and so are Tuco.</i>
7137966 7141084 <i>They got to get together and take on<br />Angel Eyes' gang.</i>
7141178 7143670 <i>But we are about to be introduced<br />to another character</i>
7143764 7147098 <i>that we were first introduced to<br />eight months before</i>
7147184 7153305 <i>in the autumn of 1861.<br />We are now in the spring/summer of 1862,</i>
7153399 7155015 <i>and we're going to meet an old friend</i>
7155109 7158397 <i>who has been hanging around<br />since that scene in the ghost town.</i>
7158487 7160353 <i>One of the people that Tuco shot,</i>
7160447 7163656 <i>who has lost his arm<br />as a result of that incident,</i>
7163742 7165983 <i>played by the Canadian actor Al Mulock.</i>
7166078 7170538 <i>He was originally to have been played by<br />the Hollywood character actor Jack Elam,</i>
7170624 7175585 <i>and in fact on the shooting script,<br />this character</i>
7175671 7179380 <i>here was referred to as Elam throughout.</i>
7179466 7182584 <i>But eventually they got Jack Elam for that<br />wonderful grizzled face</i>
7182678 7185887 <i>with his wayward eye for the first scene of</i><br />Once Upon a Time in the West,
7185973 7189932 <i>Leone's next film,<br />and instead Al Mulock played the part.</i>
7190018 7191679 <i>It gives an idea of the passage of time.</i>
7191770 7193490 <i>Again that's quite unusual in Leone's films</i>
7193522 7195433 <i>where you're in this kind of<br />Never-Never Land</i>
7195524 7197731 <i>where you don't know how much time<br />has passed.</i>
7197818 7199671 <i>But here's someone<br />who makes reference to the fact</i>
7199695 7203654 <i>that he was shot eight months before.</i>
7205993 7209281 <i>One of the aspects of Leone's films<br />that is still underrated</i>
7209371 7212284 <i>is the contribution of production designer<br />Carlo Simi</i>
7212374 7215867 <i>and his assistant,<br />the art director Carlo Leva.</i>
7215961 7219124 <i>It's detailed, it has that distressed,</i>
7219214 7223003 <i>dusty, destroyed kind of look to it.</i>
7223093 7226176 <i>Leone towns are very desolate,<br />remote places.</i>
7226305 7230674 <i>Either the Adobe model or the ghost town<br />at the beginning made of old wood.</i>
7230809 7234427 <i>And there is a very detailed kind of peep<br />show historical kind of production design.</i>
7234521 7237013 <i>Everything is magnified a bit,<br />everything's exaggerated a bit.</i>
7237107 7238973 <i>The rooms are a bit bigger<br />than they should be.</i>
7239067 7240933 <i>There is a bit too much rubble<br />lying around.</i>
7241028 7244441 <i>But it was to have a huge influence<br />on production design.</i>
7244531 7248274 <i>And Carlo Simi was a trained architect</i>
7248452 7253367 <i>who had first got into the business in the<br />1950s working on films like</i> Helen of Troy,
7253457 7255448 <i>with the production designer Ken Adam.</i>
7255542 7257283 <i>He had also worked on</i><br />Romulus and Remus,
7257377 7261792 <i>a film that Leone had written<br />and that was directed by Sergio Corbucci.</i>
7261882 7264169 <i>But he came into his own<br />with</i> Fistful of Dollars
7264259 7268093 <i>and he had this very close<br />creative relationship with Leone.</i>
7268180 7272344 <i>Somehow Leone had<br />these larger-than-life images in his mind,</i>
7272434 7275176 <i>and Simi was the man who could create<br />them for him.</i>
7275270 7279309 <i>And these scenes made at Colmenar<br />are a very good example of that.</i>
7279399 7281265 <i>It's all a little bit over-the-top.</i>
7281360 7285945 <i>It's like the music, it has an<br />amplified, exaggerated feel to it.</i>
7287533 7289552 <i>And we are about to lead up to one<br />of the great gags.</i>
7289576 7293365 <i>Just like "there are two kinds of people<br />in this world."</i>
7293455 7295287 <i>There's the great bathtub gag,</i>
7295374 7296830 <i>which was to have an afterlife</i>
7296917 7301502 <i>in of all places, the John Wayne film</i><br />Big Jake, <i>which took this joke</i>
7301588 7303704 <i>and reworked it. I never thought...</i>
7303799 7306236 <i>I remember the surprise, I never thought<br />I'd see the day where</i>
7306260 7310174 <i>a spaghetti Western joke would end up<br />in a John Wayne movie, but it did.</i>
7310931 7312534 <i>The thing about the gunfights in this film</i>
7312558 7315641 <i>is that very often<br />one or other of the parties is unprepared.</i>
7315727 7318139 <i>It's not like</i> Fistful of Dollars<br /><i>or</i> Few Dollars More
7318230 7319891 <i>where they're all<br />straight shoot gun-downs</i>
7319982 7323065 <i>or shootouts between two people<br />who are thoroughly prepared.</i>
7323151 7326485 <i>People are often sort of discovered<br />metaphorically with their pants down</i>
7326572 7329985 <i>and they have to recover the situation,<br />which adds a bit of extra tension</i>
7330075 7331861 <i>to the sequence.</i>
7331952 7335365 <i>So here is Wallach having a bath<br />with his soapsuds.</i>
7339293 7342831 I've been looking for you for eight months.
7342921 7347506 Whenever I should've had a gun<br />in my right hand, I thought of you.
7347593 7351507 Now I find you in exactly<br />the position that suits me.
7351597 7355306 I had lots of time to learn<br />how to shoot with my left.
7371325 7373783 When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.
7373869 7375388 <i>"When you have to shoot, shoot,<br />don't talk."</i>
7375412 7378404 <i>In a way, that could be the motto<br />of Sergio Leone's films</i>
7378498 7380409 <i>where the dialog was kept to a minimum,</i>
7380500 7384494 <i>the music was heightened<br />and there is a lot of action.</i>
7384838 7387921 <i>In fact, I was once doing an interview<br />with Tonino Delli Colli</i>
7388008 7390670 <i>who famously doesn't have<br />much time for critics.</i>
7390761 7393093 <i>"He said to me, " You know,<br />the trouble with critics is they</i>
7393180 7395763 <i>"treat movies as if they're<br />Picasso paintings."</i>
7395849 7397785 <i>"You know, we try to get the lights<br />in the right position,"</i>
7397809 7401302 <i>"we try to stop the actors walking<br />into the cameras and that's our job."</i>
7401396 7403353 <i>He has a very downbeat description of</i>
7403440 7405602 <i>what the role<br />of the director of photography is.</i>
7405692 7408104 <i>And I said,<br />"I guess your motto in life could be,</i>
7408195 7410840 <i>"'if you are going to shoot, shoot.<br />Don't talk about it. "He said, "Exactly.</i>
7410864 7412824 <i>"I don't like critics talking about it<br />very much."</i>
7412866 7415824 <i>That phrase has come in very useful.</i>
7415911 7419905 <i>And here is a very good example<br />of Leone's use of landscape.</i>
7419998 7422865 <i>You know, you've got<br />this bombed-out city, Peralta.</i>
7423043 7428538 <i>And they're walking through it<br />with this urban sensibility.</i>
7428632 7430818 <i>The game is to get from<br />one end of the town to the other,</i>
7430842 7432583 <i>so they can move on.</i>
7432678 7437889 <i>And Tuco will sort of crouch<br />and hide in corners.</i>
7437975 7440683 <i>Eastwood will walk with pride down<br />the middle of the street</i>
7440769 7444103 <i>because he is pure cool<br />and has this great sense of timing.</i>
7444231 7446939 <i>And they're just gonna walk<br />through this Western landscape.</i>
7447025 7450313 <i>They are not gonna pause, they are<br />not going to get nostalgic about it.</i>
7450404 7452816 <i>They are not going to turn the desert into<br />a garden</i>
7452906 7454666 <i>or do anything productive<br />with the landscape.</i>
7454700 7456031 <i>They just got to get through it</i>
7456118 7458325 <i>like you get through a street in a city</i>
7458412 7459889 <i>in order to drive through it<br />and get through</i>
7459913 7461654 <i>the other side as quickly as possible.</i>
7461748 7464240 <i>And that's their attitude to the landscape.</i>
7465252 7467835 <i>And where the morality<br />of these characters is concerned,</i>
7467921 7469161 <i>this ambiguous morality,</i>
7469256 7471338 <i>the Ugly who is actually quite charming,</i>
7471425 7474042 <i>the Good who is capable<br />of very unpleasant behavior,</i>
7474136 7477299 <i>the Bad who occasionally<br />has moments of humanity,</i>
7477389 7480507 <i>Leone said that one of the starting points<br />for that aspect of the film</i>
7480600 7482637 <i>when the title, it was originally called</i>
7482728 7484372 Two Magnificent Tramps,<br />Two Magnificent Rogues,
7484396 7487479 <i>and when they settled on the<br />title</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,
7487566 7492982 <i>he said his thinking on this<br />was based upon an old Roman song,</i>
7493113 7495855 <i>which was sometimes used as a nursery<br />rhyme which went,</i>
7495949 7500159 <i>"A cardinal is dead,<br />who did good and bad things."</i>
7500245 7504990 <i>"The bad he did very well<br />and the good he did badly."</i>
7505083 7508371 <i>And that idea runs through<br />all the relationships in this film.</i>
7508462 7510023 <i>That there is good and bad in all people,</i>
7510047 7513756 <i>and that maybe the absolute categories<br />of the traditional Western</i>
7513842 7514877 <i>needed challenging.</i>
7514968 7516458 <i>Maybe there were shades of gray.</i>
7516553 7521514 <i>But, of course, there is a cartoon-like<br />quality to the characters as well,</i>
7521600 7525685 <i>that, you know, they are not particularly<br />nuanced or complex human beings,</i>
7525771 7527728 <i>apart from Tuco.</i>
7527814 7531478 <i>And in fact Clint Eastwood has said that<br />the Eastwood character,</i>
7531568 7533434 <i>who's almost like a cartoon character,</i>
7533528 7536896 <i>would seem ludicrous<br />in a painting by Renoir,</i>
7536990 7540108 <i>would seem ludicrous<br />in a serious piece of art.</i>
7540202 7542819 <i>It's the slapstick with a gun license.</i>
7542913 7545996 <i>It's the adventure movie<br />with tragic consequences.</i>
7546083 7549326 <i>It's those sort of juxtapositions<br />that make sense of these characters.</i>
7549419 7553913 <i>They are very like cartoon characters,<br />like the Fox and the Cat in</i> Pinocchio,
7554007 7556590 <i>the relationship between the two of them.</i>
7556676 7559088 <i>But it has its subtleties as well.</i>
7564059 7566391 It doesn't matter. I'll kill them all.
7578448 7580564 They shot him at close range.
7584704 7588789 <i>So you haven't just got Blondie and Tuco<br />walking through Peralta.</i>
7588875 7591617 <i>You've also got mortar fire.<br />You don't know where it is coming from.</i>
7591711 7592980 <i>It might be from the Union side,</i>
7593004 7595792 <i>it might be from<br />the retreating Confederate side.</i>
7595882 7600592 <i>But mortars, bombs and smokescreens<br />appear all the time</i>
7600679 7606971 <i>as a kind of unseen force<br />that alters the game.</i>
7607060 7609267 They'll come looking for us.
7610689 7612100 Watch out.
7613233 7614815 There's two of them.
7616236 7618227 I want that blond alive.
7618321 7621655 <i>"That blond, " they keep saying,<br />"That blond. "He isn't blond.</i>
7621741 7623527 <i>That isn't his natural coloring.</i>
7623618 7626406 <i>But on the Italian<br />script it says,</i> "Biondo,"
7626496 7629989 <i>and in the published novelization</i><br />of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
7630083 7634748 <i>he's called Whitey,<br />but I'm afraid Clint Eastwood isn't blond.</i>
7634838 7637170 <i>It's a matter of where you're sitting,<br />I guess.</i>
7637257 7639294 <i>"I want that blond alive."</i>
7651563 7656148 <i>So Tuco is now wearing a cowboy hat<br />rather than the straw sombrero</i>
7656234 7658475 <i>that he got from Western Costume.</i>
7658570 7660256 <i>He's beginning to look like<br />a Western gunman,</i>
7660280 7664490 <i>although he doesn't have a holster,<br />he has his gun in his pocket.</i>
7664618 7666825 Were you gonna die alone?
7671625 7676836 <i>A moment of camaraderie<br />which is underscored by electric guitar</i>
7676922 7680040 <i>and insistent drum beats<br />of Morricone's score.</i>
7680133 7681444 <i>A moment of warmth<br />between the two men.</i>
7681468 7682708 <i>They actually need each other.</i>
7682802 7684759 <i>They are not gonna get through this<br />individually.</i>
7684846 7687304 <i>Two against Angel Eyes' gang<br />is quite something,</i>
7687390 7689347 <i>but one would be impossible.</i>
7689434 7690435 <i>Look at the difference.</i>
7690478 7694938 <i>Eastwood cool, striding down the street<br />in full view of everybody,</i>
7695024 7699063 <i>whereas Tuco is scurrying around<br />the corridors like a rat.</i>
7700112 7703730 <i>Different philosophies of life<br />embodied in their actions.</i>
7721968 7724255 <i>Example of Morricone's percussive score</i>
7724345 7727804 <i>rather like the score<br />for the robbery of the Bank of El Paso</i>
7727890 7732134 <i>in</i> For a Few Dollars More,<br /><i>he uses for this walking down the street.</i>
7733187 7736270 <i>Aldo Sambrell in close-up<br />in the foreground,</i>
7736357 7738598 <i>one of the surviving bad guys.</i>
7738693 7744188 <i>Percussion, piano to punctuate this,</i>
7744282 7745384 <i>and they are just about to shoot them</i>
7745408 7747445 <i>and the Civil War intervenes again<br />to save them.</i>
7747535 7750744 <i>A mortar from nowhere<br />blows up in the street</i>
7750830 7754118 <i>and provides cover<br />for the good guys to get away.</i>
7755251 7758289 <i>Whoever is firing these mortars,<br />they are very, very helpful.</i>
7773019 7774305 <i>As Leone said about this film,</i>
7774395 7779105 <i>it's a series of curtains of dust and smoke</i>
7779191 7782104 <i>behind which all these games of deception<br />take place.</i>
7782194 7787735 <i>So just as the dust on the Union uniform<br />makes it look like a Confederate uniform,</i>
7787825 7791238 <i>so the smoke and dust in this town<br />provides cover.</i>
7805134 7808297 -Angel Eyes is mine, huh?<br />-All right.
7812224 7815683 <i>And there was a piece of improvisation<br />or a late decision</i>
7815770 7820139 <i>for the scene that's coming up because<br />Angel Eyes leaves a note for them,</i>
7820232 7824066 <i>and on the shooting script the note says,</i><br />"Bravi. A presto."
7824153 7827145 <i>"Bravo, both of you. Till later."</i>
7827239 7832860 <i>But in this version it's,<br />"See you soon, idiots."</i>
7832953 7836617 <i>And Tuco can't read the word "idiots."<br />"Idi... Idi..."</i>
7836707 7840371 <i>And Clint Eastwood says,<br />"idiots. It's for you."</i>
7840461 7843078 <i>But if you look closely<br />at Clint Eastwood's mouth movements,</i>
7843172 7845083 <i>he is in fact saying, "It's for us."</i>
7845174 7846790 <i>And the idea to say, "It's for you,"</i>
7846884 7849876 <i>obviously occurred to them<br />in the dubbing studio.</i>
7852640 7853721 "Idiots."
7853808 7856971 <i>It's for us. No, it isn't.<br />"It's for you, Tuco."</i>
7857061 7860270 <i>Tuco has difficulty, is challenged<br />where reading is concerned,</i>
7860606 7864224 <i>which will be important later on<br />when we get to the graveyard.</i>
7865736 7867339 <i>And if you noticed,<br />there is a change of scenery.</i>
7867363 7870901 <i>There is much more greenery<br />in these latter sequences of the film,</i>
7870991 7873574 <i>and, in fact,<br />the Betterville Concentration Camp</i>
7873661 7876744 <i>was also filmed in a different<br />part of Spain to the rest of the film.</i>
7876831 7879368 <i>Up to now most of the film has<br />been made in Almería,</i>
7879458 7883793 <i>in the deserts of southern Spain<br />or on sets just north of Madrid,</i>
7883879 7887292 <i>with interiors shot<br />at Elios Studios in Rome.</i>
7887383 7891718 <i>But Leone once said that southern Spain<br />looks like Arizona or New Mexico</i>
7891804 7894216 <i>but northern Spain looks like Virginia.</i>
7894306 7899346 <i>And so we are moving into<br />a different world of greenery</i>
7899437 7903772 <i>where the sequences were shot just<br />south of Burgos in northern Spain,</i>
7903858 7906566 <i>in the region of Castilla-León.</i>
7906652 7910737 <i>And this sequence<br />was filmed at Covarrubias,</i>
7910823 7913941 <i>with the River Arlanza in the distance,</i>
7914034 7918904 <i>a location chosen by Carlo Simi<br />for reasons which shall be explained</i>
7918998 7920614 <i>with this wonderful overhead shot.</i>
7920708 7923200 <i>This is a great example<br />of Leone's trompe l'œil effect.</i>
7923294 7925456 <i>There they are with their map.<br />"Where are we?"</i>
7925546 7929130 <i>Suddenly some Union troops are there.<br />They appear out of nowhere.</i>
7929216 7932208 <i>The crane goes over the bushes<br />and you've got this vast battlefield</i>
7932303 7934010 <i>just out of their sight line.</i>
7934096 7938590 <i>It's like a surrealist juxtaposition<br />of just the kind that Leone liked.</i>
7938684 7943850 <i>We've got trenches. We've got<br />a huge array of Civil War artillery.</i>
7943939 7948308 <i>Some of it borrowed from<br />the war museum in Madrid,</i>
7950696 7954781 <i>and some of them were designed by<br />Carlo Simi based on prints of the period.</i>
7954867 7957404 <i>The big Parrot guns<br />and the Rogers' battery</i>
7957495 7960863 <i>were designed by Carlo Simi,<br />and I have seen the drawings,</i>
7960956 7962559 <i>whereas the mortars<br />tended to be borrowed.</i>
7962583 7964995 <i>So you have got a mixture of<br />real historical weaponry</i>
7965085 7967668 <i>and specially designed weaponry.</i>
7967755 7972750 <i>And here you have the Neapolitan<br />actor/comedian Aldo Giuffrè,</i>
7974887 7979347 <i>who was a pupil<br />of the great actor De Filippo,</i>
7979433 7983267 <i>and who is the Union Captain,<br />Captain Clinton,</i>
7983729 7988064 <i>the last of the character studies<br />in this epic film.</i>
7989151 7994772 <i>Giuffrè delivers a homily about how<br />the only way to get through war</i>
7994865 7997357 <i>is to get completely sandblasted,<br />to get drunk.</i>
7997451 8003914 <i>And it's the last kind of cynical statement<br />from a serving officer in the battle lines.</i>
8003999 8005519 <i>The only way to get through this<br />is to get drunk.</i>
8005543 8009878 <i>And in fact the speech was taken from<br />a famous piece of Italian literature</i>
8009964 8012376 <i>by a man called Emilio Lussu</i>
8012466 8014503 <i>and the book was called</i><br />A Year on the Plains,
8014593 8016425 <i>and it's all about the First World War.</i>
8016512 8020050 <i>And a First World War officer says<br />in this text,</i>
8020140 8023178 <i>"The only way to get through this<br />is to get drunk."</i>
8023269 8025010 <i>Very, very cynical.</i>
8026689 8030057 <i>The man in command of all these troops<br />and he has to get sandblasted</i>
8030150 8032187 <i>in order to get through the day.</i>
8032278 8038240 <i>So they've stumbled on a battlefield,<br />and again, you know, people might say,</i>
8038325 8040817 <i>they are probably<br />in Texas by now from New Mexico.</i>
8040911 8042322 <i>So what are they doing in Texas?</i>
8042413 8045747 <i>Why is there about to be<br />a pitched battle in Texas?</i>
8045833 8049417 <i>I mean, one associates<br />carnage in pitched battles</i>
8049503 8052996 <i>with, say, Antietam Creek<br />in the American Civil War,</i>
8053090 8056424 <i>where the creek was stained with<br />the blood of soldiers of both sides,</i>
8056510 8059719 <i>or with Gettysburg,<br />but one doesn't associate it with Texas.</i>
8059805 8063389 <i>And although there was Glorieta,<br />there wasn't a pitched battle on this scale</i>
8063475 8067059 <i>in the Texas theater of war,<br />and incidentally,</i>
8067146 8070138 <i>there weren't any railroads<br />in this theater of war yet,</i>
8070232 8071893 <i>either, because they hadn't been built.</i>
8071984 8074601 <i>But what the hell?<br />It's a statement about war in general.</i>
8074695 8076777 <i>The trenches of the First World War,</i>
8076864 8079856 <i>a speech which Italian audiences<br />would recognize</i>
8079950 8083193 <i>as being from a book<br />about the First World War,</i>
8083287 8087121 <i>but also concentration camps,<br />the Second World War, Nazis.</i>
8087207 8088823 <i>It's a statement about war in general.</i>
8088917 8091284 <i>So does it matter there wasn't<br />a pitched battle in Texas?</i>
8091378 8092413 <i>I guess it doesn't.</i>
8092504 8094336 You want to enlist, hmm?
8095841 8097297 Let's go.
8097384 8098670 Come on, gentlemen. Come on.
8098761 8102254 <i>And part of this sequence was cut after<br />the Italian release</i>
8102348 8106512 <i>from American and British prints,<br />where the officer lays it on... This bit.</i>
8106602 8110812 <i>Where the officer lays it on about booze<br />and takes them on a conducted tour</i>
8110898 8113481 <i>of the trenches<br />and shows them the battlefield.</i>
8113567 8116730 <i>This was all cut<br />and was put back 35 years later.</i>
8120908 8123149 Whoever has the most liquor<br />to get the soldiers drunk
8123243 8126736 and send them to be slaughtered...<br />Is the winner.
8127706 8132496 We and the ones over on the other side of<br />the river only have one thing in common.
8134421 8135627 All of us reek of alcohol.
8135714 8140208 <i>When they did the recce of the River<br />Arlanza and the Valley overlooking it,</i>
8140302 8142589 <i>which seemed perfect<br />for this pitched battle,</i>
8143222 8146431 <i>they hadn't accounted for the fact<br />that in the summer</i>
8146517 8149100 <i>it almost entirely dried up,<br />and they were shooting this film</i>
8149186 8151790 <i>between April and July, and this was<br />late in the shooting schedule,</i>
8151814 8154806 <i>so we're in June-July 1966.</i>
8154900 8157983 <i>So, Carlo Simi<br />had to design a barrage to actually</i>
8158070 8162689 <i>redirect water to the River Arlanza<br />in order to flood it, and get water</i>
8162783 8165901 <i>under that bridge in the month<br />that they were making it.</i>
8166078 8168069 <i>That will become an important part<br />of the story,</i>
8168163 8171451 <i>when our two heroes place<br />the dynamite charges on the bridge</i>
8171542 8173624 <i>and have to wade through the river<br />in order to do so.</i>
8174002 8176494 The Rebs have decided<br />that damn bridge...
8176588 8178454 is the key to this whole area.
8178549 8182964 <i>This was the most elaborate<br />sequence that Leone had ever made</i>
8183053 8186045 <i>up to this point as a director.<br />Of course he'd been involved in</i>
8186140 8192728 <i>the 1950s in the chariot race in</i> Ben-Hur,<br /><i>in the siege of Troy from</i> Helen of Troy,
8192813 8196477 <i>stuff in the arena for</i> Quo Vadis,<br /><i>but in his own movies</i>
8196567 8201232 <i>this was the first time he'd really<br />had the budget to go for it</i>
8201321 8204279 <i>with a lot of members of the Spanish army<br />dressed in Union uniforms</i>
8204366 8207279 <i>on one side of the river,<br />and dressed in Confederate uniforms</i>
8207369 8211988 <i>on the other for a pitched battle.<br />And partly this pitched battle</i>
8212082 8215825 <i>was a reference and Leone, actually,<br />when I interviewed him about this,</i>
8215919 8220834 <i>said it was a Keatonian echo, which was<br />a slightly pretentious way of saying</i>
8220924 8225043 <i>it's a reference to Buster Keaton's film</i><br />The General, <i>1926,</i>
8225137 8229927 <i>where there is the Battle of Rock Bridge.<br />The famous scene where a Union officer</i>
8230017 8232977 <i>"sends a train across a burning bridge<br />and says, "Ah, well, it's all right.</i>
8233020 8235352 <i>"The bridge will stand up,<br />it isn't burned out yet."</i>
8235439 8237976 <i>And the locomotive gets halfway<br />across the bridge,</i>
8238066 8241229 <i>and the Union commander<br />sees the bridge collapse</i>
8241320 8243937 <i>and the train nosedive into the river.</i>
8244031 8248400 <i>And that's very much what Leone<br />had in mind, the Battle of the Bridge</i>
8248494 8250814 <i>from</i> The General, <i>just as there's<br />been an earlier reference</i>
8250871 8255240 <i>to</i> Our Hospitality <i>by Keaton. Of course,<br />the other great cinematic reference</i>
8255334 8256916 <i>is</i> Gone with the Wind.
8257252 8262042 <i>Itself a film full of<br />refugees, and hospitals,</i>
8262382 8264623 <i>and the side effects of war.</i>
8264718 8266755 <i>The collateral damage of war.</i>
8266845 8270054 <i>And containing that famous crane<br />shot of all the wounded soldiers</i>
8270140 8274805 <i>at the rail-head in Atlanta, Georgia,<br />which is very like both this sequence</i>
8274895 8277387 <i>and the sequence which<br />follows it in the cemetery,</i>
8277481 8282066 <i>with miles and miles of uniformed<br />soldiers, many of them dismembered,</i>
8282361 8286025 <i>who have been damaged<br />or wounded by the war.</i>
8287115 8288593 <i>So there's reference<br />to</i> Gone with the Wind,
8288617 8291450 <i>but there's also reference to</i> The General.
8295040 8300535 <i>And, in the fact that this is<br />utterly pointless as an engagement,</i>
8302256 8305669 <i>the real historical events that Leone<br />may have had in mind</i>
8305759 8309468 <i>from the American Civil War are obviously<br />Pickett's charge at Gettysburg,</i>
8309555 8313093 <i>the famous doomed charge,<br />but also the three-day engagement</i>
8313183 8317598 <i>at Antietam Creek,<br />which also involved a river,</i>
8317688 8320521 <i>and which also involved<br />huge amounts of bloodshed.</i>
8321108 8325272 <i>And which was photographed by some<br />of the Civil War photographers,</i>
8325362 8327353 <i>which gave Leone the visual reference<br />for these.</i>
8327447 8331691 <i>So it may not have happened in Texas<br />but it did happen in one way or another.</i>
8332286 8336120 <i>This supremely pointless engagement<br />centered on a bridge.</i>
8337958 8342498 <i>Sergio Donati, one of the screenwriters<br />who worked uncredited</i>
8342588 8346047 <i>on</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly <i>and did<br />a lot of the final polishing of the script,</i>
8346133 8350878 <i>and a lot of the post-production<br />between July and December, 1966,</i>
8350971 8354214 <i>with editor Nino Baragli,<br />which was an incredible task</i>
8354308 8356891 <i>because Leone over-shot like mad<br />and there were many, many</i>
8356977 8360060 <i>options in the editing, and the<br />sound design took a very long time.</i>
8360147 8363856 <i>In fact, Baragli said the experience<br />was like being pulverized,</i>
8363942 8366274 <i>sitting in the editing room<br />for so many months.</i>
8366361 8369729 <i>But Donati said at one point,<br />when looking at sequences like this,</i>
8369823 8372986 <i>"he said to Leone, " Why don't you make<br />a small movie?</i>
8373076 8375179 <i>"Your movies are getting bigger<br />and bigger and bigger.</i>
8375203 8377695 <i>"Each film you make<br />has a cast of thousands,</i>
8377789 8380247 <i>"there is a set piece sequence.<br />Where is it going to end?</i>
8380334 8382666 <i>"You are trying to turn into David Lean.</i>
8383170 8385502 <i>"Why not make a movie<br />set in an apartment in Rome"</i>
8385589 8389002 <i>"in the present day which is a small-scale<br />thriller, or something like that,"</i>
8389092 8391129 <i>"or an Antonioni-style movie?"</i>
8391219 8396009 <i>But Leone had very grandiose ideas<br />and was fascinated by spectacle.</i>
8396683 8398173 <i>So his movies got bigger and bigger,</i>
8398268 8401101 <i>and they don't come much bigger<br />than the Battle of the Bridge.</i>
8401188 8405102 <i>So the two sides converge on this bridge<br />designed by Carlo Simi.</i>
8405192 8409151 <i>It's a destroyed stone bridge<br />which has a wooden superstructure,</i>
8409237 8411899 <i>it's a mixture of stone and wood.</i>
8411990 8416780 <i>And of course there's the famous story<br />told by all the different participants</i>
8416870 8420829 <i>of how the blowing up<br />of the bridge went wrong</i>
8420916 8424534 <i>in the live action version of<br />the "Ready when you are, C.B." gag.</i>
8424753 8429714 <i>Basically the charges were laid by<br />Spanish artificers</i>
8429800 8433885 <i>and the Spanish officer who had been<br />in charge of laying this dynamite</i>
8433971 8438465 <i>was given the honor<br />of pressing the detonator</i>
8438558 8442722 <i>when someone said the word</i><br />"Vaya," <i>"Go. Go for it."</i>
8443689 8446977 <i>And the Spanish officer was chatting<br />to a props man</i>
8447067 8450105 <i>and misheard the word</i> "Vaya,"<br /><i>pressed the detonator</i>
8450195 8452311 <i>and the bridge blew up,</i>
8452406 8455239 <i>while Leone and Tonino Delli Colli,<br />the director of photography,</i>
8455325 8457737 <i>watched from above<br />and could not believe their eyes.</i>
8457828 8462072 <i>It had taken 3 weeks to build<br />this 200-yard bridge,</i>
8462165 8464657 <i>and it was going to take<br />a long time to rebuild.</i>
8464751 8467459 <i>But the Spanish army stepped into<br />the breach and rebuilt it</i>
8467546 8469253 <i>in two and a half days flat.</i>
8469339 8472252 <i>So they were able to re-shoot<br />the blowing up of the bridge,</i>
8472342 8476256 <i>but it was a bad moment for everybody.</i>
8476346 8479464 <i>They also put so much dynamite<br />on it that they were worried</i>
8479558 8483802 <i>that a Renaissance monastery, which was<br />two miles away from the River Arlanza,</i>
8483895 8486307 <i>might actually be rocked by the explosion.</i>
8486398 8487718 <i>But, luckily, that didn't happen.</i>
8487774 8489936 <i>So the local historians<br />could breathe a sigh of relief</i>
8490027 8493270 <i>even though there were two explosions<br />for the price of one.</i>
8494364 8496355 -Blondie?<br />-Huh?
8496450 8498691 <i>"I've never seen so many men wasted<br />so badly."</i>
8498785 8503370 <i>This was the line that got a cheer<br />when I saw it in San Francisco in 1968.</i>
8503457 8507951 <i>Blondie standing there with<br />this bird's-eye view of the battlefield,</i>
8508045 8510787 <i>making a judgment<br />on these troop movements.</i>
8510881 8515876 <i>It chimed so well with what was on<br />the audiences' minds in the Western world</i>
8515969 8517801 <i>in the mid to late 1960s.</i>
8518680 8519795 Yeah.
8520891 8524179 Then these idiots would go<br />somewhere else to fight.
8524519 8525725 Maybe.
8527856 8532566 <i>In</i> Le Grande guerra, The Great War,<br /><i>this film written by Luciano Vincenzoni</i>
8532652 8534063 <i>and Age and Scarpelli,</i>
8534154 8538398 <i>there's a scene where our two<br />heroes become stretcher-bearers</i>
8538492 8540733 <i>during a lull in the carnage.</i>
8540827 8542738 <i>And they wander around<br />carrying the stretchers</i>
8542829 8546197 <i>and the camera in<br />a series of tracking shots surveys</i>
8546291 8550956 <i>the results of all these Italian<br />troops coming out of their trenches</i>
8551338 8554421 <i>in the First World War<br />and it's a very shocking sequence.</i>
8554508 8558092 <i>But also with a comedy element,<br />and that's picked up on in this scene</i>
8558178 8561341 <i>that's about to happen where<br />Blondie and Tuco decide to take</i>
8561431 8566221 <i>the explosives to the bridge on stretchers<br />in a lull during the proceedings.</i>
8567854 8570687 <i>And what's extraordinary<br />is these two self-serving bastards,</i>
8570774 8572515 <i>'cause that's basically what they are,</i>
8572609 8575601 <i>are about to make the Union officer's<br />dream come true.</i>
8575695 8577936 <i>He's been dreaming that<br />someone will blow up the bridge</i>
8578031 8581365 <i>and then they won't have to<br />fight this mad engagement every day</i>
8581451 8583783 <i>with all the carnage that happens.</i>
8583870 8587454 <i>And it takes Tuco and Blondie to do that<br />for him for completely different motives.</i>
8587541 8589748 <i>They're not interested<br />in the American Civil War.</i>
8589835 8591896 <i>They're interested in getting<br />to the other side of the river</i>
8591920 8596460 <i>so they can go to Sad Hill Cemetery<br />and find $200, 000 in gold,</i>
8596550 8598040 <i>in Confederate gold.</i>
8608395 8610511 A little of this will help.
8610814 8614148 <i>Another Italian bottle to offer<br />the Union commander.</i>
8616820 8619357 Take a slug of this, Captain.
8619447 8621233 Keep your ears open.
8643096 8646805 <i>I guess this is one of, in a strange way,<br />this is one of the most realistic depictions</i>
8646892 8649600 <i>of the American Civil War ever put on film.</i>
8649686 8655181 <i>It doesn't have the well-scrubbed,<br />over-lit look of</i> Gone with the Wind,
8655275 8659860 <i>or the sanitized</i> Raintree County<br /><i>approach to battle.</i>
8659946 8663530 <i>You really get a sense of carnage,<br />of bullets hitting people</i>
8663617 8668282 <i>and of the damage that could be done<br />with the kind of ammunition</i>
8668371 8672581 <i>that was available in 1861 to 1865,<br />so graphically described</i>
8672667 8676376 <i>in that famous TV documentary series<br />about the American Civil War.</i>
8676463 8679956 <i>If you got hit by one of those bullets, the<br />chances are that gangrene would set in</i>
8680050 8682087 <i>and you would lose a limb.<br />It did a lot of damage</i>
8682177 8684714 <i>even when you were only scratched.</i>
8684804 8688798 <i>There's a real sense of that kind of<br />damage being done in this sequence.</i>
8688892 8692385 <i>And even despite all that Leone<br />allows himself a moment of comedy</i>
8692479 8694516 <i>with these two<br />sort of Laurel and Hardy characters</i>
8694606 8697974 <i>carrying a stretcher<br />with the explosives on it.</i>
8698068 8702653 <i>It's like "loot" written on a bag<br />of two thieves breaking into a house.</i>
8702781 8707116 <i>It's almost a cartoon image as the<br />stretcher-bearers take away the wounded</i>
8707202 8708988 <i>in this lull in the battle.</i>
8718797 8721664 <i>And playing against<br />the comedy of the scene,</i>
8721758 8724125 <i>this lyrical choral version</i>
8724219 8728429 <i>of one of Ennio Morricone's<br />American Civil War musical themes.</i>
8731851 8735139 <i>It's the theme that was whistled when<br />they arrived in the concentration camp</i>
8735230 8737221 <i>and played on the harmonica.</i>
8739109 8740628 <i>In fact, it was played on the harmonica</i>
8740652 8743130 <i>when they first arrived at the<br />concentration camp by Franco De Gemini,</i>
8743154 8746112 <i>the man that played the harmonica<br />in</i> Once Upon a Time in the West
8746199 8747564 <i>for Charles Bronson.</i>
8747659 8754247 <i>But here it's tenor voices humming.<br />So it's lyrical and sad and emotional,</i>
8754874 8757161 <i>but what's going on is quite surreal.</i>
8758878 8763372 <i>Here's the water in the River Arlanza<br />courtesy of Carlo Simi's barrage</i>
8764134 8766421 <i>in order to prevent it being dried up.</i>
8770682 8772514 <i>And again, there are moments<br />in this sequence</i>
8772600 8776764 <i>which were cut from both<br />the American and British prints.</i>
8777564 8779646 <i>We just got a sense of them<br />strapping dynamite</i>
8779733 8782646 <i>onto one of the legs of the bridge,</i>
8782736 8784522 <i>but here there's much more.</i>
8785488 8787479 ...it sure would be a pity.
8789868 8793236 <i>And at last it's the moment for Tuco<br />to admit his half of the secret</i>
8793330 8795446 <i>and to ask Blondie to admit his half</i>
8795540 8798703 <i>The interesting thing is<br />Tuco tells the truth and Blondie lies,</i>
8798793 8800830 <i>as we'll subsequently discover.</i>
8800920 8802627 <i>So,</i> il Buono, <i>the Good,</i>
8802714 8805172 <i>is not necessarily as straight as he seems</i>
8805258 8807340 <i>and</i> il Brutto, <i>the Ugly,</i>
8808345 8810712 <i>is not necessarily as ugly as he seems.</i>
8813266 8815803 <i>Of course, there had been<br />a lot of blowing up of bridges</i>
8815894 8818010 <i>in spectacular cinema in the years</i>
8818104 8820015 <i>preceding</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
8820106 8822188 <i>Famously, obviously,</i><br />The Bridge on the River Kwai,
8822275 8826109 <i>and that's referenced in the<br />whistling as the troops in lockstep</i>
8826196 8827956 <i>arrive at the Betterville<br />Concentration Camp.</i>
8827989 8830697 <i>The Colonel Bogey theme<br />is also referenced here</i>
8830784 8834448 <i>with the blowing up of the bridge.</i><br />The Pride and the Passion
8834537 8838201 <i>about the Peninsular War in Spain made<br />by Stanley Kramer with Cary Grant</i>
8838291 8840032 <i>also involved the blowing up of a bridge.</i>
8840126 8844245 <i>But I guess the most specific reference<br />is John Ford's</i> The Horse Soldiers,
8844339 8846671 <i>the engagement at Baton Rouge,</i>
8846758 8851047 <i>where John Wayne<br />refuses a slug of whiskey</i>
8851137 8855756 <i>just before the engagement,<br />which is possibly satirized</i>
8855850 8858683 <i>in the Union commander,<br />not only refusing a slug of whiskey</i>
8858770 8862638 <i>but actually pouring it down his throat<br />in order to get through the day.</i>
8862732 8864126 <i>The final scene</i> of The Horse Soldiers
8864150 8868394 <i>involves the blowing up of a bridge and<br />an engagement in the American Civil War.</i>
8868488 8870195 <i>So that may have been a reference as well.</i>
8870281 8874616 <i>Very often the movies of John Ford<br />lie behind Leone's visual decisions</i>
8874702 8877865 <i>because they made a huge impact<br />on him when he was a child</i>
8877956 8879788 <i>and it took him a long time<br />to exorcise them</i>
8879874 8882144 <i>and get them out of his system,<br />and this would happen a lot</i>
8882168 8883448 <i>in</i> Once Upon a Time in the West,
8883503 8886837 <i>where there are many, many references<br />to John Ford's movies.</i>
8891594 8893710 <i>This is a wonderful moment now<br />where Tuco,</i>
8893805 8897673 <i>when asked to give his half of the secret,<br />can't quite bring himself to say it</i>
8897767 8901761 <i>and enunciate the words.<br />It's a classic Eli Wallach moment.</i>
8901855 8903687 <i>He's trying to get the<br />words "Sad Hill" out.</i>
8903857 8905939 The name of the cemetery is...
8924085 8926201 Sad Hill. Now it's your turn.
8934554 8937046 The name on the grave is...
8940977 8942467 Arch Stanton.
8944564 8945850 Arch Stanton?
8946399 8948481 <i>Tuco is right to be<br />a bit quizzical about this.</i>
8948568 8953859 <i>It isn't, actually, as we'll discover.<br />But it's too late to make an issue of it.</i>
8954699 8958283 <i>And there's a cut here from the bridge<br />with this very short fuse</i>
8958369 8961327 <i>to Tuco and Blondie<br />being about half a mile away</i>
8961414 8963496 <i>as they jump in,<br />which is slightly farfetched.</i>
8963583 8966541 <i>But there's a story there, too,<br />because Leone wanted the two actors</i>
8966628 8970212 <i>to sit very close to the bridge<br />when the explosion happened.</i>
8970298 8974007 <i>And Clint Eastwood said to Leone,<br />"I'll do it if you will, Sergio."</i>
8974093 8979634 <i>And eventually Sergio Leone stood about<br />half a mile away watching</i>
8979724 8983012 <i>and two extras sat there<br />during the blowing up of the bridge,</i>
8983102 8985935 <i>and as you can see, debris flies around<br />in a very dangerous way</i>
8986022 8990437 <i>striking both of them. So in take one<br />the bridge blew up by mistake</i>
8990527 8993610 <i>and in take two, two extras<br />were nearly very badly hurt,</i>
8993696 8997314 <i>but Eastwood and Wallach<br />very sensibly didn't want to lie</i>
8997408 9000116 <i>quite so close<br />to the blowing up of the bridge.</i>
9003331 9006995 <i>When asked about this Sergio Leone<br />smiled and said,</i>
9007126 9009663 <i>"Bridges tend to get blown up<br />in my movies."</i>
9017804 9021718 <i>And this isn't a minor explosion<br />of the</i> River Kwai <i>kind,</i>
9021808 9024516 <i>this is almost like<br />a thermonuclear explosion</i>
9024602 9028812 <i>as the entire bridge goes up<br />and covers the neighborhood with smoke.</i>
9028898 9031139 <i>Close-ups of military hardware.</i>
9035196 9037528 <i>Final show of aggression<br />between the two sides</i>
9037615 9039731 <i>before they decide it's a complete<br />waste of time</i>
9039826 9042568 <i>and move on somewhere else,<br />leaving the way clear.</i>
9064309 9067017 <i>A smokescreen covering<br />the passage of time.</i>
9068855 9070516 <i>With the two of them asleep.</i>
9070607 9074020 <i>And then the following morning<br />an improvised moment from Eli Wallach</i>
9074110 9077774 <i>where he remembers getting up<br />and stretching his legs</i>
9077864 9080196 <i>as if he wanted to have a pee<br />after a night's sleep</i>
9080283 9082344 <i>in this rather uncomfortable position,<br />and Leone thought</i>
9082368 9083608 <i>that was absolutely hilarious.</i>
9083703 9085819 <i>It appealed to his rather<br />earthy sense of humor.</i>
9085913 9088576 <i>So they kept it in.<br />Here's Tuco with his bottom showing</i>
9088667 9093787 <i>and his legs crossed, being woken up<br />unceremoniously by Blondie.</i>
9094840 9096205 <i>And then,</i>
9098761 9100593 <i>Tuco stretches his legs.</i>
9108312 9110804 <i>And they have indeed all gone,<br />just leaving the sandbags</i>
9110898 9115233 <i>and the basket work<br />and the different barrages</i>
9115319 9119108 <i>and trenches completely deserted<br />but all the weaponry's gone.</i>
9124161 9128405 <i>There's Tuco adjusting his dress,<br />having left a trail of pee on the ground.</i>
9138967 9143302 <i>And this shot is a reconstruction<br />of a famous Civil War photograph</i>
9143389 9147678 <i>by Alexander Gardner<br />of the carnage after a battle.</i>
9148227 9151310 <i>I mean, much of it is based<br />on Civil War archive photos</i>
9151397 9153513 <i>but this one is very, very direct.</i>
9156860 9159818 <i>So they've got to the<br />right side of the river</i>
9159905 9162647 <i>and they're nearing destination.</i>
9162741 9165403 <i>But where is Lee Van Cleef?<br />Where is Angel Eyes?</i>
9165494 9168452 <i>He seems to have been out of the story<br />for a very long time.</i>
9170833 9174918 <i>There's a very touching moment now<br />with a chapel up on the hill</i>
9175462 9178295 <i>where a young soldier is dying</i>
9178382 9180714 <i>and rather like the transactions<br />earlier in the film,</i>
9180801 9185591 <i>giving a bottle of whiskey,<br />giving a cigar, helping out</i>
9186390 9189508 <i>various people on the edges of the battle,</i>
9189601 9193515 <i>Blondie will do just the same thing as<br />a dying moment with this soldier.</i>
9223427 9225839 <i>How he manages to strike a match<br />on his wet trousers,</i>
9225929 9231015 <i>I'll never know. But somehow he succeeds<br />to light up his cigarillo.</i>
9232144 9236354 <i>And there's a young Confederate soldier<br />in amongst the rubble of the chapel.</i>
9259671 9263130 <i>So Blondie gives him his coat<br />to cover the wound.</i>
9275562 9279305 <i>And also gives him a cigar,<br />which leads to a moment</i>
9279399 9282141 <i>which amongst cinema-goers<br />in the '60s was very famous,</i>
9282236 9286571 <i>the last moment of Jean-Luc Godard's film</i><br />À bout de souffle,
9286698 9289315 <i>where the Jean-Paul Belmondo<br />character, who has been</i>
9289409 9292322 <i>sort of imitating a gangster throughout,<br />gets shot,</i>
9292412 9297157 <i>and on his dying breath the smoke<br />from his cigarette trails out of his mouth,</i>
9297251 9299242 <i>and you know that he's died<br />when the smoke stops.</i>
9299336 9301168 <i>And this is a moment that's recaptured.</i>
9301255 9304839 À bout de souffle.<br /><i>Out of breath.</i> Breathless.
9305759 9308296 <i>And Jean-Luc Godard will be referenced<br />in the last moments</i>
9308387 9311004 <i>of Leone's</i> Duck, You Sucker, <i>as well.</i>
9311098 9315934 Pierrot le fou, <i>another film with Belmondo,<br />with the death of James Coburn.</i>
9316019 9320434 <i>But here it's</i> À bout de souffle,<br /><i>and cineastes in Europe in the mid '60s</i>
9320524 9322265 <i>would have recognized it immediately.</i>
9322359 9325727 <i>And Eastwood in exchange for his coat<br />picks up his famous poncho.</i>
9327030 9329522 <i>So he's got his sheepskin waistcoat,<br />he's got his denim shirt,</i>
9329616 9331056 <i>and he's now got the poncho as well,</i>
9331118 9333280 <i>and he's ready for the final settling<br />of accounts,</i>
9333370 9336283 <i>where he'll be dressed<br />in iconic style at last.</i>
9375996 9380991 <i>And at last Tuco literally bumps into<br />Sad Hill Cemetery.</i>
9381084 9386079 <i>The location is Carazo,<br />south of the River Arlanza.</i>
9386173 9389666 <i>Leone employed 250 soldiers to dig</i>
9389760 9393594 <i>what he referred to as 10,000 graves<br />in two days</i>
9393680 9397048 <i>in this vast military cemetery at Sad Hill.</i>
9397142 9399142 <i>And in the middle of the cemetery<br />are stone graves,</i>
9399186 9402019 <i>so it's built<br />around a consecrated cemetery,</i>
9402105 9405393 <i>but it radiates outwards in all directions.</i>
9405484 9408067 <i>A most wonderfully evocative set.</i>
9408153 9412613 <i>And the music is a theme by Morricone<br />called</i> The Ecstasy of Gold.
9412699 9416363 <i>A simple four-note theme starting off<br />on piano and oboe</i>
9416453 9420788 <i>and then moving into bells<br />and choir and clangs and drums</i>
9420874 9423787 <i>and the soaring soprano voice<br />of Edda Dell'Orso</i>
9423877 9427290 <i>to become one of Morricone's<br />most famous themes</i>
9427381 9429873 <i>in his work for Italian Westerns.</i>
9429967 9433130 <i>The moment with the dog<br />when Tuco arrives at the cemetery</i>
9433220 9435632 <i>was in fact improvised.<br />They'd set up the sequence</i>
9435722 9440011 <i>and Leone unleashed this dog to watch<br />Tuco's instant reaction to it</i>
9440102 9441433 <i>and Eli Wallach bristled.</i>
9441520 9444478 <i>So amidst all this organization<br />there's an improvised moment</i>
9444564 9448307 <i>and he's got to find the tomb<br />with Arch Stanton written on it.</i>
9448402 9450088 <i>Shortly after</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
9450112 9454231 <i>was completed, there was a parody of it<br />that came out in Italy</i>
9454741 9458359 <i>with a well-known comedy duo called<br />Ciccio and Ingrassia</i>
9458453 9460945 <i>and the film was called</i><br />The Handsome, the Ugly and the Stupid.
9461039 9463952 <i>It was made in 1967 and it finished it up<br />in a graveyard.</i>
9464042 9466659 <i>They're looking for a grave<br />with the name Smith on it.</i>
9466753 9469370 <i>And they see this graveyard<br />with hundreds and thousands of graves</i>
9469464 9472001 <i>and every single one has the name Smith<br />on it.</i>
9472092 9474584 <i>So they can't find the gold.<br />But in this case they know</i>
9474678 9476965 <i>there's only one Arch Stanton.</i>
9477055 9480298 <i>And Tonino Delli Colli,<br />the director of photography,</i>
9480392 9484807 <i>told me about how this sequence<br />was filmed.</i>
9484980 9487267 <i>Basically he wanted to get a long shot</i>
9487357 9492193 <i>and a close-up of Tuco running<br />in circles around this cemetery,</i>
9492279 9493394 <i>both at the same time.</i>
9493488 9497026 <i>So he put a pole on his tripod<br />and a camera at each end,</i>
9497117 9499700 <i>and on one of the cameras he had<br />a 25mm lens,</i>
9499786 9502369 <i>and on the other he had a 75mm lens.</i>
9502456 9506370 <i>And he turned them together so you got<br />the shots of the graves spinning,</i>
9506460 9509168 <i>but you also got the shots of Tuco,<br />and as he put it,</i>
9509254 9512838 <i>it took half the time to shoot it<br />and it was much easier to edit.</i>
9516678 9521138 <i>Leone and Morricone have both said<br />that the themes for the last 20 minutes</i>
9521224 9524182 of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,<br /><i>the musical themes, were written</i>
9524269 9527352 <i>before the film was shot,<br />and it certainly looks as though</i>
9527439 9532058 <i>the movie was cut to a pre-existent theme.</i>
9532152 9535065 <i>But none of the actors remember<br />it being played on the set,</i>
9535155 9537633 <i>unlike in</i> Once Upon a Time in the West<br /><i>where they can all remember</i>
9537657 9541491 <i>this open-reel tape playing the themes<br />which they acted to.</i>
9542537 9544995 <i>But I think the thing<br />that seems to have happened is</i>
9545082 9549326 <i>that the music had been written and<br />scored for a sort of minimal orchestra</i>
9549419 9551786 <i>and Leone had it in his mind<br />when he shot it</i>
9551880 9553691 <i>and knew that he was going to<br />cut to that music.</i>
9553715 9556002 <i>I think what we're watching,<br />in other words,</i>
9556093 9559506 <i>in the summer of 1966<br />is the birth of the rock video.</i>
9560263 9567181 <i>A piece of film that's exactly cut<br />to this swelling theme on the soundtrack.</i>
9568814 9570521 <i>Music videos begin here.</i>
9575362 9579947 <i>The other thing<br />that Tonino Delli Colli recalls</i>
9580033 9583651 <i>is that there's a lot of close-up work<br />from now on in the movie,</i>
9583745 9586783 <i>and traditionally close-ups<br />were knocked off by cameramen</i>
9586873 9589956 <i>last thing in the evening,<br />because you didn't need lots of extras</i>
9590043 9593126 <i>in the background and you're not<br />doing master shots, and so on.</i>
9593213 9596797 <i>But in Spain they were working<br />14 or 15 hours a day,</i>
9596883 9600968 <i>said Delli Colli, and it was daylight<br />in Spain till about 9:30 at night.</i>
9601054 9604422 <i>And Leone kept shooting and kept<br />shooting until he was good and ready</i>
9604516 9609477 <i>to stop, and they'd start with wide-lens<br />shots and finish up with close-ups.</i>
9609563 9611930 <i>But close-ups took a very, very long time<br />to set up,</i>
9612023 9613934 <i>and Delli Colli kept saying,<br />"Can't we go home?</i>
9614025 9617859 <i>"It's the end of a long working day."<br />"No, no. Just one more close-up."</i>
9617946 9622031 <i>And Delli Colli said that sometimes<br />he had discussions with Leone,</i>
9622117 9625200 <i>"and the discussion consisted of Leone<br />saying, "Bugger off,</i>
9625287 9627403 <i>"we'll continue till I'm good and ready."</i>
9632085 9635999 <i>Now, Tuco was introduced with a dog<br />running into a saloon</i>
9636089 9637830 <i>in that ghost town at the very beginning,</i>
9637924 9640507 <i>and a dog walked into the cemetery<br />just as he arrived.</i>
9640594 9643507 <i>Now he's behaving like a dog<br />as he digs through the earth</i>
9643597 9645759 <i>in order to get to the coffin<br />in Arch Stanton's grave,</i>
9645849 9648307 <i>so the rat is becoming a dog.</i>
9650228 9653562 <i>Camera pulls back, shadow of Blondie,</i>
9653648 9656140 <i>like a ghost he appears.<br />Tuco would have known he was there.</i>
9656234 9658817 <i>It's a real cinematic moment.<br />This figure is appearing,</i>
9658904 9660235 <i>we haven't seen him before.</i>
9660322 9663440 <i>Presumably, Tuco would have seen him<br />walking from about half a mile away.</i>
9663533 9668118 <i>But you pull back the camera<br />and it discovers Blondie.</i>
9669080 9672823 <i>And it's about to happen again<br />with the third of the lead characters.</i>
9674461 9678500 <i>"But here in pantomime<br />we have Tuco, "Will I pull my gun?</i>
9678590 9683084 <i>"No, it's not worth it." Blondie smiles.<br />Tuco's made the right decision.</i>
9683970 9688510 <i>Tuco picks up the spade,<br />the shovel, to start digging again. Yep.</i>
9690018 9691099 <i>Get digging.</i>
9693313 9696772 <i>But suddenly another spade appears<br />underneath the camera's eye.</i>
9697025 9698390 <i>Organ music.</i>
9700612 9705607 <i>And at last,</i> il Cattivo, <i>the Bad, Sentenza.</i>
9705700 9708909 <i>Angel Eyes has arrived to<br />make the triangle complete.</i>
9708995 9710781 You're not digging.
9722509 9725297 <i>Throughout the film<br />there's a whole series of threesomes</i>
9725387 9729597 <i>where in desert sequences<br />or pieces of landscape</i>
9729683 9731160 <i>where there aren't any telegraph poles</i>
9731184 9733346 <i>or mountains<br />to give you a sense of perspective,</i>
9733436 9736098 <i>where the triangle<br />creates the sense of perspective.</i>
9736189 9739398 <i>Three figures, one in the distance,<br />two on either side,</i>
9739484 9741896 <i>and one cut off by the frame on the edge,</i>
9741987 9743569 <i>which create this perspective</i>
9743655 9746738 <i>through the human beings<br />who are inhabiting it.</i>
9746825 9748657 <i>And when asked why he did this,<br />Leone said,</i>
9748743 9752031 <i>"It's like the paintings of Edgar Degas.<br />He did that with ballet dancers,</i>
9752122 9754183 <i>"where you have one in the distance<br />to create perspective,"</i>
9754207 9757450 <i>"one on the left, one on the right<br />cut off by the frame of the painting."</i>
9757544 9760627 <i>"And that sort of triangulation<br />creates its own perspective."</i>
9760714 9763046 <i>And that's what he was trying to do.</i>
9774436 9776038 I'll write the name<br />on the bottom of this stone.
9776062 9778975 <i>This is the final time that Blondie<br />lies in this movie,</i>
9779065 9781306 <i>"I'm gonna write the name on the bottom<br />of this stone."</i>
9781401 9784314 <i>In fact, he doesn't write anything,<br />as we'll discover.</i>
9784404 9786361 <i>So, if he wasn't to survive the duel,</i>
9786448 9789281 <i>nobody would know<br />where the gold was hidden.</i>
9791411 9796497 <i>A moment of recognition of the way<br />that</i> il Cattivo <i>uses his gun.</i>
9797584 9800144 <i>Very macho moment as the two size<br />each other up as professionals.</i>
9802922 9806290 <i>And here in the script,<br />it simply says, "The three..."</i>
9806384 9808500 <i>In the shooting script,<br />"The three in a triangle</i>
9808595 9810586 <i>"in the desolation of the cemetery."</i>
9810680 9815220 <i>"Immobile. Only the wind<br />and the stones and the grass."</i>
9815310 9817096 <i>"A long act of tension."</i>
9817687 9820850 <i>And that's all it says<br />to describe the next five minutes.</i>
9821441 9823523 <i>And on the soundtrack,<br />we have a piece of music,</i>
9823610 9825977 <i>a swelling piece of music by Morricone</i>
9826071 9828779 <i>which is a kind of stately bolero,</i>
9828865 9831823 <i>the kind of thing you might have played<br />at a bullfight.</i>
9831910 9836620 <i>Flamenco guitar played very aggressively<br />by Bruno Battisti D'Amario,</i>
9836706 9839619 <i>castanet, mariachi trumpet.</i>
9839709 9843122 <i>And after the first verse, we have<br />a reference to</i> For a Few Dollars More,
9843213 9845625 <i>where a music box<br />takes up the theme for a moment,</i>
9845715 9849549 <i>which is a kind of wink in the direction<br />of Leone's previous movie.</i>
9849636 9852719 <i>And the entire thing<br />as these three characters</i>
9852806 9856925 <i>sidle up into position,<br />is cut to the music.</i>
9857519 9861478 <i>And Leone<br />when describing this scene said,</i>
9861564 9864056 <i>"This triello," he even invented a word<br />to describe it.</i>
9864150 9867768 <i>It is not a duello, it's a triello.<br />"This triello is a sequence</i>
9867862 9871776 <i>"which gave me the greatest satisfaction,<br />especially from the editing point of view.</i>
9871866 9875985 <i>"The journeys of all the characters<br />come to a conclusion within it,</i>
9876079 9879447 <i>"and the whole film can be read<br />in the eyes of the main characters.</i>
9879541 9884377 <i>"Tuco has the eyes of a rat,<br />anxious, calculating, naïve.</i>
9884796 9890007 <i>"Blondie has the eyes of a guardian angel,<br />assured, intelligent, amused.</i>
9890093 9895554 <i>"Angel Eyes has the eyes of a robot,<br />cold, collected, implacable.</i>
9896141 9900055 <i>"I always enclose the final sequence,<br />the denouement of my films</i>
9900145 9902136 <i>"within the confines of a circle.</i>
9902230 9904938 <i>"It's there<br />that Clint kills Gian Maria Volontè</i>
9905024 9906560 <i>"in</i> For a Few Dollars More,
9906651 9908938 <i>"that Clint, Eli, and Lee<br />confront each other</i>
9909028 9910484 <i>"in</i> The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.
9910572 9914861 <i>"It is the arena of life, the moment<br />of truth at the moment of death.</i>
9915577 9919445 <i>"The first three close-ups of each<br />of the actors took us an entire day.</i>
9919914 9923373 <i>"I wanted the spectator to have<br />the impression of watching a ballet.</i>
9923460 9925417 <i>"A ballet, a dance of death.</i>
9925503 9928791 <i>"And I had to accumulate shots of<br />their cunning in action,</i>
9928882 9932591 <i>"their looks, their gestures,<br />their hesitations."</i>
9932677 9936671 <i>"The music gave a certain lyricism<br />to all these realist images,"</i>
9936764 9942225 <i>"so the scene became a question of<br />choreography as much as suspense."</i>
9942979 9947644 <i>And as they put themselves in position<br />for this triello,</i>
9947734 9951147 <i>it really is a matter of choreography,<br />a copybook example of editing,</i>
9951237 9955026 <i>that's been used in film schools<br />ever since the mid-1960s</i>
9955116 9959155 <i>as the great example of cutting<br />to music an action sequence.</i>
9959913 9963952 <i>The so-called movie brats in the late '60s<br />encountered it in film school in California</i>
9964042 9969503 <i>and it had a huge influence on their films.<br />Scorsese, Milius, Carpenter,</i>
9969589 9971705 <i>Spielberg, George Lucas.</i>
9971799 9974166 <i>And then, it had a huge influence<br />on the films</i>
9974260 9978800 <i>of the video brats of the 1980s.<br />Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.</i>
9978890 9982849 <i>Tarantino has called this sequence<br />his favorite in any movie he's ever seen,</i>
9982936 9985223 <i>his all-time favorite sequence<br />in the movies,</i>
9985313 9988556 <i>the triello at the end</i><br />of The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
9992237 9994274 <i>It had more influence<br />on the history of film</i>
9994364 9996822 <i>than any other sequence<br />in Leone's cinema.</i>
10012715 10015673 <i>Eli Wallach remembers that<br />the equipment was quite primitive.</i>
10015760 10021597 <i>They took a long time to change<br />the lenses on the Techniscope cameras</i>
10021683 10026348 <i>for the faces, for the hands,<br />for the medium shots, for the long shots.</i>
10026437 10028207 <i>So, they had to wait an age.<br />They had to wait days</i>
10028231 10030268 <i>to get this sequence in the can.</i>
10033152 10036235 <i>Hands creeping towards guns.<br />And look at Lee Van Cleef's hand,</i>
10036322 10038984 <i>he has a piece of his finger missing.</i>
10039075 10042864 <i>And in real life, Lee Van Cleef did<br />not have a piece of his finger missing.</i>
10042954 10045992 <i>So the hand they're using is a prop hand,</i>
10046082 10049871 <i>as it were, a body double,<br />to show that this man,</i>
10049961 10052749 <i>even he has been damaged<br />by his life as a gunfighter.</i>
10074068 10077356 <i>Time stretched, time dilated.</i>
10077488 10079769 <i>It's extraordinary.<br />This has nothing to do with real time.</i>
10079824 10081844 <i>It has nothing to do with<br />what might happen in the real world.</i>
10081868 10085953 <i>This is a purely cinematic moment<br />which makes sense on the editing bench</i>
10086039 10088531 <i>and with these visuals<br />and with this music.</i>
10089125 10091116 <i>A virtuoso piece of film-making.</i>
10095632 10098124 <i>And, of course, it turns out<br />it wasn't a triello after all.</i>
10098217 10101881 <i>It was a duello because Clint Eastwood<br />has emptied Eli Wallach's gun</i>
10101971 10105965 <i>in the night. So, basically,<br />it was between the Good and the Bad,</i>
10106059 10107891 <i>as it always is in Westerns.</i>
10108519 10109975 <i>And the Bad ends up being shot,</i>
10110063 10114148 <i>so he falls very neatly<br />into a dug grave all ready for him,</i>
10114233 10116270 <i>about to be joined by his hat and gun.</i>
10134128 10135414 <i>So, like in a children's game,</i>
10135505 10137792 <i>Eastwood walks into the middle<br />of the arena,</i>
10137882 10140965 <i>which is like the Coliseum in Rome,<br />or some gladiatorial combat.</i>
10141761 10145004 <i>Those who are about to die salute you.<br />And he picks up the stone</i>
10145098 10148432 <i>where he's alleged to have written down<br />the name on the grave.</i>
10148851 10150842 <i>But he hasn't written anything.</i>
10155316 10157557 <i>And so, he speaks Tuco's line back to him.</i>
10157652 10162112 You see, in this world, there's<br />two kinds of people, my friend...
10162198 10164360 Those with loaded guns...
10164450 10166782 and those who dig.
10166869 10169236 -You dig.<br />-Where?
10169330 10171196 <i>So, up to now Tuco<br />has always had this line,</i>
10171290 10173201 <i>"There's two kinds of<br />people in this world,"</i>
10173292 10175579 <i>but it's been taken up by Blondie now.</i>
10177171 10179833 <i>So, it turns out that the grave<br />is the one marked "Unknown,"</i>
10179924 10181585 <i>next door to Arch Stanton.</i>
10181676 10184008 <i>So, Tuco has found<br />the Arch Stanton grave,</i>
10184095 10186211 <i>which would've taken Blondie<br />a very long time.</i>
10186305 10189343 <i>So, it's now a question of<br />digging up Unknown.</i>
10189434 10191266 There's no name here either.
10191352 10194435 <i>And there was nearly a bit of an<br />accident when they were shooting</i>
10194522 10197731 <i>this moment that's to come<br />which Eli Wallach recalled.</i>
10197817 10199086 <i>Remember, there was the question</i>
10199110 10201046 <i>of whether they put cotton wool<br />in the horse's ears,</i>
10201070 10204028 <i>there was the question of the<br />soft lead handcuffs and the train,</i>
10204115 10206527 <i>there was the question of the bridge<br />blowing up prematurely.</i>
10206617 10210576 <i>Well, this time they put some acid<br />in the pouches of gold</i>
10210663 10212950 <i>in order to weaken them,<br />so that when they were struck</i>
10213040 10215998 <i>with a shovel, they would open.</i>
10216085 10220500 <i>And the props man put some of this acid<br />in a bottle of Spanish lemon soda</i>
10220590 10224458 <i>which Eli Wallach was rather partial to.<br />And just before filming this sequence,</i>
10224552 10227590 <i>he took a swig of this lemon soda<br />and got a mouthful of acid,</i>
10227680 10230217 <i>quickly realized what it was<br />just as it hit his lips,</i>
10230308 10231469 <i>and spat it out.</i>
10231559 10233345 <i>But it was quite a near one.</i>
10233436 10236554 <i>This movie was quite dangerous to make<br />in some respects.</i>
10263049 10265837 <i>So, weakened by the acid,<br />the pouch opens.</i>
10267303 10269294 Blondie! It's all ours, Blondie!
10269388 10272380 <i>And we have<br />another cinematic moment here,</i>
10272517 10278058 <i>where the camera goes up with Tuco<br />and we have a noose.</i>
10278439 10280976 <i>Reference back to the scam<br />at the beginning of the movie,</i>
10281067 10282478 <i>if you'd remember that far back,</i>
10282568 10284087 <i>when they were shooting through the rope</i>
10284111 10287069 <i>and turning Tuco in<br />for all of his various crimes.</i>
10287156 10289318 <i>So that's been set up<br />just outside camera range</i>
10289408 10291740 <i>and it's another one of those<br />purely visual moments</i>
10291828 10294946 <i>that works as cinema<br />but wouldn't work in real life.</i>
10295248 10299116 Now I want you to stand up there<br />and put your head in that noose.
10299210 10305172 <i>So the Good is behaving in rather<br />a nasty way to his friend Tuco,</i>
10305258 10309468 <i>but, of course, it's a way of putting<br />distance between him and the bandit.</i>
10310680 10315265 <i>Tuco has to stand on the cross<br />and put his head through the noose,</i>
10315351 10318889 <i>rather like the way that Blondie<br />had to stand on a chair</i>
10318980 10322314 <i>in the hotel in Santa Fe<br />and put his head through the noose</i>
10322400 10325438 <i>and Tuco was going<br />to shoot the legs off the chair.</i>
10325528 10330068 <i>Only this time, Blondie just rides away,<br />leaving him standing on the cross</i>
10330157 10332990 <i>until he falls over and throttles himself</i>
10333744 10337112 <i>So he's got riches<br />beyond his wildest dreams at his feet.</i>
10337206 10342701 <i>Tuco is the proud owner of $100, 000,<br />half Arch Stanton's $200, 000.</i>
10342795 10346004 <i>The trouble is he can't spend it<br />and he can't get to it.</i>
10346090 10348377 <i>And in a version of the sort of<br />water torture,</i>
10348467 10351255 <i>he can look at it<br />without being able to reach it.</i>
10351429 10353340 <i>It's positively Machiavellian.</i>
10355433 10359722 <i>And the black horse, which presumably<br />belongs to the guy in black,</i>
10359812 10362053 il Cattivo, <i>Lee Van Cleef,</i>
10362148 10367018 <i>has a Sharps' rifle inside its scabbard<br />by the saddle.</i>
10367111 10371105 <i>And that's the horse<br />that</i> il Buono <i>will use to ride away.</i>
10374327 10375408 Four for you...
10375494 10379738 <i>So a memory of them sitting in that<br />canyon in New Mexico,</i>
10379832 10382199 <i>"Four for you and four for me."</i>
10382460 10385202 <i>That time way back<br />when they had the conversation</i>
10385296 10390086 <i>about how to go 50-50 or whether Tuco<br />should get more than 50% of the proceeds</i>
10390176 10392588 <i>'cause he's the one who's<br />doing the suffering.</i>
10392678 10396922 <i>A Tuco-eye view of this $100, 000<br />at his feet.</i>
10407860 10412024 <i>And just as the film began with<br />this big face blocking out the landscape,</i>
10412114 10415607 <i>a moment of landscape of Almería<br />and a big face blocking it out,</i>
10415701 10419945 <i>it ends with Clint Eastwood,<br />the Good, getting on his horse</i>
10420039 10422827 <i>and riding off into the geology<br />of Northern Spain,</i>
10424085 10425826 <i>a speck on the landscape.</i>
10426837 10428248 Sorry, Tuco.
10428673 10432007 <i>Leone originally wanted to end this film<br />with a helicopter shot.</i>
10432093 10434926 <i>And there are many stills of him<br />actually setting up this shot.</i>
10435012 10438471 <i>The idea was you get a helicopter shot,<br />which was unusual in the mid '60s,</i>
10438557 10441720 <i>it would take off and the two of them<br />would be mere specks on the landscape.</i>
10441811 10444553 <i>This guy standing on the cross<br />on the one hand,</i>
10444647 10446166 <i>and Blondie on his horse on the other.</i>
10446190 10449478 <i>And you'd get this big, big shot<br />of the entire landscape.</i>
10449568 10452936 <i>But he couldn't keep the camera still.<br />The technology wasn't developed enough.</i>
10453030 10457024 <i>It wobbled too much. So, in the end<br />he decided to do the big long shot</i>
10457118 10459325 <i>on which the movie ends,<br />with Clint Eastwood</i>
10459412 10461699 <i>riding off into the geology of Spain.</i>
10464291 10467579 <i>We're about to get some choice examples<br />of Tuco's swearing,</i>
10469005 10470791 Vera Cruz-<i>style,</i>
10472258 10474090 <i>which go with<br />some of the convoluted curses</i>
10474176 10476258 <i>that he used earlier in the film.</i>
10476637 10481723 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly<br /><i>opened in Italy on Christmas Eve, 1966,</i>
10481809 10486475 <i>and in the course of the next few months,<br />it made $4.3 million,</i>
10486565 10488021 <i>which was a very respectable figure.</i>
10488108 10489868 <i>But worldwide,</i><br />The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
10489943 10493481 <i>was more successful<br />than any other of Leone's films.</i>
10493572 10496940 <i>It opened in the United States<br />in January, 1968,</i>
10497034 10499742 <i>following the release<br />of</i> A Fistful of Dollars
10499828 10502695 <i>and</i> For a Few Dollars More<br /><i>at the end of 1967,</i>
10502789 10506123 <i>and it made $6 million in the United States</i>
10506209 10508576 <i>over the ensuing two years.</i>
10508670 10512413 <i>So, United Artists, which had put up<br />half the 1.3 million</i>
10512507 10515107 <i>which was the budget, did very,<br />very well out of their investment.</i>
10515135 10518548 <i>In fact, 1968 was a very good year<br />for United Artists.</i>
10518638 10522097 <i>It also propelled Clint Eastwood<br />into the front rank of cinema stars.</i>
10522184 10525552 <i>Even though he hadn't made<br />a successful Hollywood movie yet,</i>
10525645 10530685 <i>he was credited as being the fifth<br />most popular movie actor in the world</i>
10530776 10534144 <i>as a result of his success<br />in</i> The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.
10535530 10538147 <i>I guess this is the quintessential<br />Italian Western.</i>
10538241 10540198 <i>As Alberto Moravia said,<br />"This is the moment</i>"
10540285 10543323 <i>"when the Italianization of the Western<br />was complete."</i>
10543663 10547497 <i>It's the quintessential Italian Western<br />with Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach,</i>
10547584 10552579 <i>Ennio Morricone, and Sergio Leone<br />at the peak of their powers,</i>
10552672 10557291 <i>all working together<br />on an epic journey through the Wild West.</i>
10558470 10560837 <i>It remains the classic Italian Western.</i>
10577656 10581866 <i>And a final curse and homage to<br />those Burt Lancaster scenes in</i> Vera Cruz,
10581952 10587038 <i>where the trumpet fanfares mean<br />that we can't quite hear what he says.</i>
10587124 10589536 <i>"You're the son of a..."</i>
10589626 10592994 <i>And exactly the same thing happens now<br />with Eli Wallach.</i>
10595215 10598298 Just a dirty son of a bitch!
10599219 10602757 <i>Wallach is the choir,<br />Eastwood is the flute,</i>
10604057 10606219 <i>Van Cleef is the arghilophone.</i>
10607686 10611680 <i>So, in the main title theme,<br />each of the characters is taken up again,</i>
10611773 10614481 <i>bringing them together<br />in the main title theme.</i>
10615735 10618568 <i>And off we go into the countryside<br />around Burgos.</i>
10619865 10622106 <i>It's still there but it's very overgrown.</i>
10622200 10625067 <i>I once went on a pilgrimage<br />to that cemetery at Sad Hill.</i>
10625162 10627574 <i>And you can see it<br />if you stand about a mile away</i>
10627664 10629780 <i>as a kind of circle through the thicket,</i>
10629875 10632913 <i>but it's overgrown and become<br />part of the Spanish ecology again.</i>
