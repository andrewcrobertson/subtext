636644 638134 You're...
638546 640377 ...from Baker?
650758 653022 Tell Baker that l told him<br />all that l know already.
653094 654823 Tell him l want to live in peace,<br />understand?
654896 657729 That it's no use<br />to go on tormenting me!
657865 660663 l know nothing at all<br />about that case of coins.
660735 661861 Now that gold has disappeared.
661936 665372 But if he'd listened to me,<br />we could have avoided this altogether.
666040 667871 l went to the Army court.
667942 669637 There were no witnesses.
669711 671906 They couldn't uncover any more.
672213 675011 l can't tell Baker<br />what happened to the money.
675083 676914 Go back and tell him that!
679454 681922 Word's around you had a visitor...
683591 685582 ...and Baker knows it.
687395 689329 Name of Jackson.
694535 696366 Jackson was here...
697939 700601 ...or Baker's got it all wrong.
707949 709940 He's not wrong.
710451 714888 Maybe Baker would like to know<br />just what you and Jackson had to say...
715123 717318 ...about the cash box.
721229 723959 That's not what l'm being paid for.
727869 731930 l'm only interested in<br />what name Jackson's hiding under now!
735043 737739 Why do you think Jackson<br />may be assuming another name?
737812 740303 l would have found him already.
740982 744315 When l start off to find somebody,<br />l find them.
744452 746682 That's why they pay me.
752060 754585 What is Baker paying you?
757365 758992 That your family?
768876 769774 Yes.
770778 773008 Nice family.
775183 777549 What does he pay you for murdering me?
780655 782316 $500...
783324 784882 ...to get the name!
791199 792632 The name!
802210 803199 Carson.
803845 805472 Bill Carson.
805680 808410 That's what he calls himself now.
838713 841273 Here's a lot of money: $1,000.
845419 847080 $1,000...
849657 851420 ...and some in gold.
851659 853524 That's a tidy sum.
857598 859225 But when l'm paid...
859967 861764 ...l always see the job through.
934742 936141 lt's you.
936777 938608 Any information?
940481 942073 Too much.
943651 946484 He said quite a bit<br />that should interest you...
946554 949114 ...and one or two things<br />that interested me.
949190 951124 Such as?
951592 954186 The name Jackson's hiding under is...
954362 955920 ...Bill Carson.
958199 960133 That's your bit.
962770 964135 Keep talking.
964572 967166 He also mentioned somethin'<br />about a certain...
967275 970403 ...cash box which just happened<br />to disappear.
971545 972944 That's my bit.
973681 975012 Anything else?
975883 978215 Not enough for you, huh?
978419 980319 Well, you don't have to worry.
980388 982856 He'll never say anything to anybody again!
984158 985750 Perfect.
986427 988258 Here you are.
988496 990225 Here, this is for you.
990298 992198 You did a good job for me.
992300 993995 Worth $500!
998039 999939 l almost forgot.
1000007 1002271 He gave me $1,000.
1002576 1004908 l think his idea was that l kill you.
1012586 1014679 But you know, the pity is,<br />when l'm paid...
1015056 1017547 ...l always follow my job through.
1017825 1019554 You know that.
1066607 1068837 No pistol, amigo.
1068909 1070672 lt won't do you any good.
1070778 1072336 There are three of us.
1088863 1093129 You know that you have a face<br />beautiful enough to be worth $2,000?
1099173 1103337 But you don't look like<br />the one who will collect it.
1110017 1112679 A couple of steps back.
1159166 1160394 Thank you.
1169944 1171775 How much you worth now?
1172246 1173508 How much?
1174782 1176010 $2,000!
1178919 1180580 That's right, $2,000.
1180988 1182785 Yeah, $2,000.
1189997 1192090 i Hijo de puta que te pario!
1192366 1193993 You'll pay for this!
1194068 1196901 l hope you end up in a graveyard...
1196937 1199633 ...with the cholera, and the rabies,<br />and the plague!
1199707 1203438 Cut me loose!<br />Cut me loose, you filthy bastard!
1203477 1204808 Put me down!
1204879 1207746 l hope your mother ends up<br />in a two-dollar whorehouse!
1207815 1210306 Cut me loose! Cut me loose!
1211385 1213216 You can still save yourself.
1213287 1215983 Let me go, and l'll pardon you.
1216257 1217781 Let me go!
1218859 1221726 l feel sick. The blood is rushing....
1223197 1224755 l'm dry.
1225766 1227631 Agua! Water!
1234408 1236899 You swine! You son of a bitch!
1239113 1241206 You're brave with a man who's tied up!
1241282 1242840 Come back!
1242917 1244817 Come back and fight!
1245853 1247821 You bastard!
1248756 1250189 Who the hell is that?
1250257 1252487 One bastard goes in, another comes out.
1252560 1254221 Cut it out! Cut it out!
1254295 1257594 l'm an honest farmer!<br />l'm innocent of any--
1260167 1262260 So, you're an honest farmer.
1262336 1264566 You recognize this man?
1264972 1266963 Yeah, it's you!
1268609 1271635 Who says so? You can't even read.
1272079 1273774 Roll it up. Roll it up!
1273881 1276441 l'll give you a good idea<br />where you can put it.
1276517 1280613 To hell with all you sheriffs and deputies<br />and all who gave birth to you!
1280688 1283418 Hey, everybody, look! Look!<br />He's giving him the filthy money!
1283490 1284616 Judas!
1284692 1286182 You've sold my hide!
1286994 1289019 But you won't enjoy any of that money,<br />not a penny.
1289096 1292088 lf there's justice,<br />that money will go to the undertakers!
1292166 1295192 Every penny of it.<br />You know who you are?
1295369 1297667 You want to know whose son you are?
1297738 1300104 You don't, l do. Everybody does.
1300174 1302074 You're the son of a thousand fathers!
1302142 1303734 All bastards like you!
1303811 1306609 And your mother? Your mother....
1306680 1308113 You bastard!
1309083 1313679 Your mother, it's better not to talk of her.<br />l never hurt anybody!
1314021 1317081 ...wanted in 14 counties of this state...
1318158 1322993 ...the condemned is found guilty<br />of the crimes of murder, armed robbery...
1323631 1327294 ...of citizens, state banks,<br />and post offices...

1364071 1365265 ...known as the ''Rat''...

1369176 1370973 ...to hang by the neck until dead.
1371045 1374412 May God have mercy on his soul.<br />Proceed!
1400340 1402399 Five for you.

1406146 1407272 ...five for me.
1408849 1410942 Five for you...
1411018 1413578 ...and five for me.
1413921 1415946 Know how much you're worth now?
1416023 1417923 No, how much?
1418092 1419616 $3,000!
1423397 1426230 There are two kinds of people<br />in the world, my friend.
1426300 1427562 Those with a rope around their neck...
1427634 1430364 ...and the people who have the job<br />of doing the cutting.
1430437 1433634 Listen, the neck at the end<br />of the rope is mine!
1433741 1435766 l run the risks.
1436210 1439646 So, the next time, l want more than half!
1439847 1442315 You may run the risks, my friend, but...
1442382 1444646 ...l do the cutting.
1445753 1448620 lf we cut down my percentage...
1449957 1451424 Cigar?
1453060 1456552 ...it might interfere with my aim.
1457965 1461731 But if you miss,<br />you had better miss very well.
1461902 1465599 Whoever double-crosses me<br />and leaves me alive...
1465672 1468869 ...he understands nothing about Tuco.
1469877 1471469 Nothing!
1475015 1477483 Wanted in 15 counties of this state...
1477551 1481419 ...the condemned, standing before us...<br />sitting before us...
1481488 1484787 ...Tuco Benedicto Pacifico<br />Juan Maria Ramirez...
1484892 1487156 ...has been found guilty<br />by the Third District Circuit Court...
1487227 1491095 ...of the following crimes:<br />murder, assaulting a justice of the peace...
1491165 1493633 ...raping a virgin of the white race...
1493700 1497659 ...and statutory rape<br />of a minor of the black race...
1498038 1501565 ...of derailing a train<br />in order to rob the passengers....
1507247 1509044 What'd you find out, Shorty?
1509116 1510981 lf you ask me, it seems like a book!
1511051 1515283 An armed unit, escorting a cash box<br />of gold coins, meets a Yankee ambush...
1515322 1517813 ...and only three of them are saved.
1517891 1520325 Stevens, Baker, and Jackson.
1520394 1522862 The thing that wasn't saved, though,<br />was the coins.
1522930 1525728 But then the Army decides, of course,<br />it ought to hold a hearing...
1525799 1526925 ...and Jackson's acquitted.
1527000 1529867 He disappears, and becomes Bill Carson.
1530037 1531004 l know his name.
1531071 1534234 But you don't know<br />just who you're lookin' for, and l do!
1534308 1538301 And when he's found,<br />l'd be scared to be put in his shoes!
1540714 1543615 -Where is Carson?<br />-All l know is Carson re-enlisted.
1543684 1545174 The poor guy's minus an eye.
1545252 1547413 He lives with a girl called Maria,<br />who'll tell you.
1547487 1549955 She's a fresh young whore in the territory.
1550023 1551012 Where is she?
1551091 1555027 Now, what's the name of that town?<br />lt's someplace very near....
1557531 1559362 Santa Ana.
1561802 1564236 Adios, half-soldier.
1569343 1570537 Hand me down a whiskey!
1582155 1585386 Glad they got him.<br />A man guilty of all those crimes!
1585792 1587657 People with ropes around their necks<br />don't always hang.
1587728 1590162 What do you mean?
1591465 1595231 Even a filthy beggar like that<br />has a protecting angel.
1602009 1605308 A golden-haired angel watches over him.
1605412 1608108 Of all these crimes, the accused<br />has made a full, spontaneous confession.
1609650 1613381 Therefore, we condemn him<br />to be hung by the neck until dead.
1613453 1616752 May the Lord have mercy on his soul.<br />Proceed.
1631605 1633937 Let's get the hell out of here!
1665439 1667999 What are you saying?<br />Anybody can miss a shot?
1668075 1670009 Nobody misses<br />when l'm at the end of the rope!
1670077 1673706 You never had a rope around your neck.<br />Well, l'm going to tell you something.
1673780 1678149 When that rope starts to pull tight,<br />you can feel the devil bite your ass!
1680988 1682922 Yeah, you're right.
1683757 1685554 lt's getting tougher.
1686493 1688324 The way l figure...
1688395 1692627 ...there's really not too much future<br />with a sawed-off runt like you.
1692699 1694098 What do you mean?
1694201 1698331 'Cause l don't think you'll ever<br />be worth more than $3,000.
1698839 1700932 What do you mean?
1701108 1704236 l mean, our partnership is untied.
1705012 1706946 Oh no, not you.
1707014 1708948 You remain tied.
1709016 1711917 l'll keep the money,<br />and you can have the rope.
1712119 1716180 You filthy, double-crossing bastard!<br />Of all the stinking, dirty tricks--
1716356 1719120 The way back to town is only 70 miles.
1720494 1724225 lf you save your breath,<br />l feel a man like you could manage it.
1724297 1725525 Adios.
1725599 1728625 You filthy bastard! Come here!
1729036 1731937 Come here! Cut this rope off!<br />Get off that horse!
1732039 1734166 Get off that horse! You filthy coward!
1734241 1735401 lf l ever catch you...
1735475 1737636 ...l'll rip your heart out and eat it!
1737711 1741477 l'll skin you alive!<br />l'll hang you up by your tongue.
1742949 1745786 l'll kill you! l'll kill you!
1747387 1751881 Such ingratitude, after all the times<br />l've saved your life.
1759332 1760799 You wouldn't leave me here....
1760867 1762357 Come back!
1762436 1764927 Wait! Listen, Blondie!

1847521 1849386 Who are you?
1849556 1851547 What do you want with me?
1851658 1854559 Go on talking about Bill Carson.
1855061 1857427 l don't know him.
1858064 1861363 You were calling to him in the dark!
1864971 1866097 Where is he?
1866173 1868835 What are you gonna do?
1869910 1872572 l'll ask the questions!
1873980 1875948 Where is he?
1882989 1884456 Where is he?
1893033 1895194 That's enough!
1896203 1897693 l don't know where he is.
1897771 1901332 He packed his things ten days ago,<br />and went away with his unit.
1901408 1902932 They all left.
1903009 1905409 Which company? Where'd he go?
1909316 1912285 Third Cavalry, General Sibley.
1912986 1915216 They left for Santa Fe.
1915255 1917985 That's all l know. l swear!
2010317 2013377 l'm very sorry, but the store is closing.
2051257 2053555 Revolvers?
2058631 2060690 Revolvers!
2061434 2064631 Here's where l keep the best ones.

2078151 2081416 Jocelyn, another Remington, and this--
2081888 2083719 That's enough.
2126499 2128592 Cartridges.
2136810 2139938 -You wanna try the pistol, just step--<br />-Let's go.
2223129 2225154 Cartridge.
2232972 2234064 How much?
2234140 2236005 $20.

2277750 2279240 Come here!
2309482 2311245 This morning l heard the whole thing.
2311317 2313547 They say Colonel Canby's closing in<br />with his Northerners...
2313620 2316453 ...and no later than tomorrow<br />that they'll be in the city.
2316522 2319514 That's why these Southerners<br />are getting out!
2319592 2323858 You see, as soon as these cowards hear<br />there are blue shirts around, they run.
2323930 2326865 -These rebels have no will to fight!<br />-Poor things.
2326933 2328525 They'll soon be finished.
2328601 2329761 We get rid of these bastards...
2329836 2332270 ...then we begin making money<br />on those Yankees.
2332338 2336570 They carry gold, not paper dollars.<br />And they're going to beat the South.
2337777 2340974 Look, see that one with the white beard<br />sitting in the wagon?
2341047 2344881 General Sibley. He looks dead.<br />He's finally getting out of our hair.
2344951 2347920 Hooray for Dixie!<br />Hooray, hooray for Dixie!
2353660 2356151 Where's the owner of that horse?
2356729 2357923 Please, mister, sir...
2357997 2360022 -...a bad heart condition....<br />-Where?
2360099 2362567 The war has frightened me already.
2362869 2365269 l'm looking for the owner of that horse.
2365338 2368569 He's tall, blond, he smokes a cigar,<br />and he's a pig!
2369008 2370270 Where is he now?!
2370343 2373210 You leave him be! He doesn't know<br />who rides every horse!
2373279 2376077 You stay quiet, old hen!
2377316 2380649 Upstairs. Upstairs, in Room 4, senyor.
2386359 2387826 Hear that?
2393299 2396291 You rotten criminals, how dare you?!
2573946 2575709 Your spurs.
2587927 2590657 There are two kinds of spurs, my friend.
2590730 2593631 Those that come in by the door...
2593699 2596224 ...and those that come in by the window.
2596302 2598668 Take off that pistol belt.
2606012 2607946 lt's empty.
2610082 2612073 Mine isn't.
2618157 2622116 Even when Judas hanged himself,<br />there was a storm, too.
2625498 2627966 That could be cannon fire.
2628034 2631595 Cannon fire or storm,<br />it's all the same to you!
2633906 2636704 You ever see this before, my friend?
2645818 2648446 Throw it over the roof beam.
2650289 2652314 That's it.
2663336 2665463 And get on that!
2675214 2676977 That's right.
2677049 2679483 Now, make sure the rope is tight!
2679785 2682720 lt's got to hold the weight of a pig!
2688894 2691727 Now, put the rope around your neck!
2698337 2700362 Yes, very good.
2701374 2703433 lt's too big for your neck?
2703509 2705443 We'll fix that right away.
2705511 2707206 l have another system.
2707279 2710077 A little different than yours.
2710316 2712307 l don't shoot the rope.
2712385 2714717 l shoot the legs off the stool!
2719158 2720819 Adios.
2902741 2906268 ...guilty of the following crimes:<br />horse theft....
2924697 2926824 And Shorty?
2950289 2952416 Sorry, Shorty!
2953259 2955693 Move, come on, let's go!
2980219 2983450 l don't know. As soon as l hit<br />the desert, l'm thirsty.
2983722 2984882 Burns, huh?
2984957 2988723 They say people with fair skin<br />can't take too much.
3013052 3016385 Like that, you won't<br />have to carry so much.
3017723 3019691 Where are we going?
3020092 3021354 Where?
3021427 3023793 Where l'm going, amigo.
3024563 3026087 Over that way.
3026165 3029623 Another 100 miles<br />of beautiful sunbaked sand.
3030436 3032802 Even the armies are afraid<br />to march through there.
3032871 3035169 Sibley's men are retreating up there.
3035274 3038004 Canby's men are coming here...
3038610 3042011 ...but no one will set foot in this hell...
3042948 3045382 ...except you and me.
3046885 3050082 One hundred miles. That's a nice walk.
3052558 3055686 What was it you told me the last time?
3057162 3061360 ''lf you save your breath,<br />l feel a man like you could manage it.''
3063168 3066228 And if you won't manage it, you'll die.
3066305 3067829 Only slowly.
3068941 3071409 Very slowly, old friend.
3076682 3079583 After you, please. Start walking.
3196034 3198127 Taking a rest?
3198604 3202973 Come on, Blondie, we don't have<br />very far to go. Only 70 miles.
3204476 3208105 Only eight and a half hours more<br />before sunset.
3208247 3210545 That's not too bad.
3211617 3213414 Come on!
3336642 3338576 And so, Blondie...
3340846 3342871 ...it's goodbye.
3569140 3572769 $200,000 in gold. lt's yours.<br />Just get me water!
3578083 3580278 What's that you say?
3580352 3581876 Who the hell are you?
3584289 3586655 My name's Bill Carson now.
3587559 3589151 Surprise attack.
3590996 3591928 All dead.
3591997 3595091 My name is Jackson. Not Carson.
3595467 3597332 Yeah, yeah, glad to meet you, Carson.
3597402 3600997 l'm Lincoln's grandfather.<br />What was that you said about the dollars?
3601072 3603165 $200,000, all mine.
3604409 3607003 Was the Third Cavalry's.
3607445 3609538 Baker has nothing.
3610148 3611308 The gold....
3611383 3614318 l hid the gold. The gold is safe!
3615086 3616951 Where? Here?
3618256 3619985 Talk!
3620458 3622517 ln the cemetery.
3622594 3624585 Which cemetery?
3625664 3627996 On Sad Hill.
3628066 3629897 There's a grave by the....
3630735 3632225 Which grave?
3632304 3634772 Have a name? Have a number?
3634839 3637239 Come on, you dummy, talk!
3638877 3641141 There's no number.
3641579 3643069 There's a name.
3644249 3646444 lt's written.
3653058 3654355 Water!
3657128 3659926 You talk first, eh?<br />l'll give you the water later!
3660065 3661760 Sad Hill Cemetery, okay?
3661866 3663094 ln a grave, okay.
3663168 3665762 But it must have<br />a name or a number on it.
3665870 3668862 There must be 1,000, 5,000, you...!
3672744 3674644 Don't die.
3674713 3677079 Don't die! l'll get you water!
3677182 3680549 Stay there.<br />Don't move, l'll get you water.
3680618 3682984 Don't die until later!
3708713 3710010 Get away from there!
3716554 3718317 He's dead.
3721926 3723689 l'll kill you!
3726131 3729328 lf you do that, you'll always be poor.
3730402 3733599 Just like the greasy rat that you are.
3734039 3736200 lf l were you, l'd...
3736441 3738102 ...keep me alive.
3738376 3740708 What did he tell you?
3741746 3742906 A name.
3744149 3745980 Name on a grave.
3746217 3747912 What name?
3761666 3763759 Blondie, don't die.
3764836 3767304 Don't die! l'm your friend.
3767539 3771134 Please don't die. Please! l'm your friend!
3774479 3776640 l'll help you. l'll help you!
3776714 3779683 Don't move. l'll be right back.<br />l'll get the water.
3779751 3782219 Don't die like that pig.
3783755 3785416 Water, Blondie?
3785490 3787515 Don't drink! lt's no good for you.
3787592 3789492 Feel better?
3789561 3793258 Blondie, what's the matter?<br />Please don't die!
3822026 3823323 l've got a very sick man here.
3823394 3824884 But we have no more beds here.
3824963 3827363 Let him have yours!
3832570 3834868 -Where is Pablo Ramirez?<br />-Padre Ramirez.
3834939 3836600 He is away at the moment.
3836841 3839207 He should be back any day now.
3839310 3843747 lt doesn't matter. For the moment,<br />we'll take very good care of my friend.
3843848 3845406 May God be praised.
3845483 3846711 ln case you didn't know it...
3846784 3850652 ...God is on our side, too.<br />Because he hates the Yanks.
3852390 3853823 Father, is he still breathing?
3853892 3856019 Yes, of course.
3856661 3858561 You're heavy.
3900438 3903373 All right, put a fresh bandage on him.
3904342 3906572 Put him in my cell.
3911616 3914016 Out, soldier. Out you go, come on.
3914118 3918145 Look out for him, please.<br />He's like a brother to me!
3937141 3939939 Father, did he speak?<br />Did he say anything?
3970308 3972970 Did he ask for me?<br />Did he speak about anything?
3973044 3975808 No, he hasn't spoken as yet.<br />But you mustn't worry.
3975880 3979748 He's both young and strong.<br />That's what's kept him going until now.
3979917 3982647 He should regain his strength<br />in a very short time.
3982720 3986952 Thank you, Father. You don't know<br />how much this boy's life means to me!
4065703 4069434 The old Father tells me<br />you'll be up and around in a few days.
4069640 4073007 You're very lucky to have me<br />so close when it happened.
4073344 4075744 Think, if you'd been on your own.
4078116 4079674 l mean, when...
4079751 4082219 ...when one is ill...
4082553 4085989 ...it's good to have somebody close by,<br />friends or relations.
4088059 4089583 Do you...
4089660 4091855 ...you have parents, Blondie?
4092330 4093820 A mother?
4093898 4096162 Not even a mother.
4096901 4098198 No one.
4099103 4101936 You're all alone, huh? Like me, Blondie.
4102607 4105337 We're all alone in the world.
4105410 4107401 l have you, you have me.
4110481 4112813 Only for a little while, l mean.
4113184 4115118 lt had to happen now.
4115820 4118288 What a dirty rotten trick of fate!
4118356 4121484 We could have all that money<br />in our hands.
4127865 4130425 l must tell you the truth, Blondie.
4130535 4133732 ln my place, you would do the same thing.
4135206 4137436 lt's all over for you now.
4138142 4141111 There's nothing anyone can do anymore.
4145249 4147547 lt's my fault! Mine, mine!
4160198 4164066 l'll tell you one thing, Blondie.<br />lf l knew that my last hour had come...
4164135 4168572 ...l swear, in my place, in your place,<br />l would do the same thing.
4169807 4173072 l would tell about the gold.<br />Yes, yes l would!
4173177 4175645 l would tell the name on the grave.
4175713 4178409 After all, what good is the money to you<br />if you're dead?
4178483 4180542 l know the name of the cemetery.
4180618 4183746 But you know how many graves<br />there are there?
4183821 4185015 Please.
4187124 4189092 Please, have a little.
4192396 4195365 Coffee? Please tell me the name.
4197435 4198959 On the grave.
4199804 4202796 lf l get my hands on the $200,000...
4204642 4207236 ...l'll always honor your memory.
4207712 4210840 l swear it! l'll always honor your memory!
4213918 4215886 Come closer.
4220892 4221984 Tell me.
4227598 4229896 l'll sleep better...
4231168 4233762 ...knowing my good friend...
4234005 4236030 ...is by my side...
4236107 4237631 ...to protect me.
4248319 4250651 ''Tuco, water. Please, water.''
4250755 4254282 But if l get that name from you,<br />l'll give you water!
4261432 4264299 All right, you dirty skunk,<br />get your ass off the bed!
4264368 4266495 Come on, come on, the party's over.
4266571 4268300 The wagon is all ready to go.
4268406 4270465 From the way the wounded<br />are pouring into this place...
4270541 4273806 ...we better get the hell out of here<br />before we get caught up in the war.
4273878 4276779 Tuco, Father Ramirez is back.
4276981 4281441 This is something l have to look into.<br />lt'll only take a minute. Get moving.
4281586 4283213 -Where? This way?<br />-Yes.
4300972 4302064 Hey, Pablo!
4310514 4312744 Don't you recognize me?
4314251 4315980 lt's me, Tuco!
4316587 4318919 Let me embrace you.
4321759 4324694 l don't know the right thing!
4329100 4331364 l was just passing by here.<br />l said to myself...
4331435 4335269 ...l wonder if my brother<br />remembers his brother.
4337942 4339773 Did l do wrong?
4340845 4343473 lt doesn't matter. l'm very happy.
4343547 4345845 You've seen me, Tuco.
4347818 4350412 Yeah, well, l'm very glad l came.
4356260 4359195 Oh, my uniform. lt's a long story.
4360431 4363696 Let's talk about you. lt's more important.
4364201 4366032 You look very well.
4366337 4368999 A bit thin, perhaps, but...
4370274 4373243 ...you always were thin, eh Pablito?
4376280 4378339 What about our parents?
4379583 4381847 Only now do you think of them?
4383020 4385045 To begin after nine years?
4387258 4389123 Nine years?
4390428 4391861 So it's nine years.
4395399 4398425 Our mother has been dead a long time.
4399637 4402970 Our father died only a few days ago.
4403040 4404940 That's why l was away.
4406811 4409211 He asked for you to be there.
4409280 4411612 But there was only me.
4418422 4420447 And you?
4420524 4423652 Outside of evil,<br />what else have you managed to do?
4425029 4428521 lt seems to me<br />you once had a wife someplace.
4430935 4432994 Not one, lots of them!
4433070 4435732 One here, one there,<br />wherever l found them.
4436941 4439739 Go on, preach me a sermon, Pablo.
4441479 4443811 What good would that be?
4445049 4447517 Just keep on the way you're going.
4447585 4449018 Go away.
4450454 4451682 The Lord have mercy on your soul.
4451756 4455351 l'll go, l'll go. While l'm waiting<br />for the Lord to remember me...
4455426 4459089 ...l, Tuco Ramirez,<br />brother of Brother Ramirez...
4459163 4461154 ...will tell you something.
4461232 4463223 You think you're better than l am.
4463300 4465962 Where we came from,<br />if one did not want to die of poverty...
4466036 4468436 ...one became a priest or a bandit!
4468506 4471100 You chose your way, l chose mine.
4471175 4472836 Mine was harder.
4472977 4474706 You talk of our mother and father.
4474779 4476906 You remember when you left<br />to become a priest.
4476981 4478380 l stayed behind!
4478449 4482283 l must have been ten, twelve.<br />l don't remember which, but l stayed.
4482353 4484753 l tried, but it was no good.
4484822 4486983 Now l am going to tell you something.
4487057 4488581 You became a priest because you were...
4488659 4491651 ...too much of a coward to do what l do!
4522226 4524456 Please, forgive me, brother.
4554158 4555819 My belly's full.
4557661 4559595 Nice guy, my brother.
4559964 4562330 l didn't tell you<br />my brother was in charge here.
4562399 4564594 Everything, like the pope almost.
4564668 4566602 He's in charge in Rome.
4566670 4570162 My brother, he says to me:<br />''Stay, brother, don't go home.
4570241 4572004 ''We never see each other.
4572076 4576513 ''Here, there's plenty to eat and drink.<br />Bring your friend, too.''
4576580 4578946 Whenever we see each other,<br />he never lets me go.
4579016 4581416 lt's always the same story.
4581485 4584147 My brother, he's crazy about me.
4587992 4588890 That's so.
4588959 4592292 Even a tramp like me,<br />no matter what happens...
4593097 4598592 ...l know there's a brother somewhere<br />who will never refuse me a bowl of soup.
4600004 4601403 Sure.
4602806 4606742 Well, after a meal,<br />there's nothing like a good cigar.
4674745 4676212 Wake up, you!
4676580 4678013 The troops are coming!
4678082 4680107 Blue or gray?
4686890 4691350 They're gray like us. Let's say ''hello''<br />to them and then get going.
4692096 4695361 Hurrah for the Confederacy! Hurrah!
4695432 4697491 Down with General Grant!
4697601 4700502 Hurrah for General...what's his name?
4700571 4701595 Lee!
4703640 4707076 God is with us<br />because he hates the Yanks, too!
4708846 4712612 God is not on our side<br />'cause he hates idiots also.
4732503 4734130 Prisoners of war...
4734204 4735899 ...forward...
4736807 4738001 ...march!
4800804 4803068 Form a single file.
4862833 4864460 Robert Clark.
4864535 4865763 Present.
4866737 4867999 Sam Richmond.
4868071 4869299 Present.
4872442 4873909 Bill Carson.
4880184 4882175 l said Bill Carson!
4882986 4885887 Hey, Blondie, isn't that Angel Eyes?
4886423 4889654 All right, what's he doing? Sleeping?!
4892529 4895692 Yeah, and you better be Bill Carson.
4898702 4900101 That's me!
4908445 4910606 Please, Carson.
4911782 4913511 Answer, ''Present'' !
4915152 4917313 What are you, deaf?
4922993 4925962 Now, suppose you say ''present,'' Carson.
4927364 4930265 l like big fat men like you.
4930334 4932734 When they fall, they make more noise.
4932803 4935363 And sometimes they never get up.
4936306 4938171 Wallace...
4939676 4941405 ...that's enough.
4944047 4945878 Sergeant!
4947417 4950409 The captain wants to see you right away.
4953357 4956190 Be sure these two get good treatment.
4966270 4969899 Hey, Blondie, did you hear that?<br />Good treatment!
4976813 4979304 For the last time, sergeant...
4979383 4980475 ...l'm telling you...
4980550 4983644 ...l want the prisoners<br />treated as prisoners.
4984388 4986185 No more brutality!
4987291 4991091 There's hundreds of prisoners out there<br />and only a few men to guard them.
4991161 4993493 What am l supposed to do?<br />l have to have respect!
4993563 4998398 l think that you'll manage to gain<br />their respect by treating them better!
4999770 5002364 Are our men treated that well<br />in Andersonville Camp?
5002439 5005203 l don't give a goddamn<br />what they do in Andersonville!
5005275 5007607 While l'm in charge here,<br />the prisoners are not to be...
5007678 5008804 ...tortured...
5008879 5010574 ...or cheated...
5010881 5012473 ...or murdered!
5012783 5014580 ls that an accusation?
5014651 5017984 Sergeant, gangrene is eating<br />my leg away...
5018789 5020416 ...not my eyes.
5020490 5023584 l know the prisoners here are being<br />robbed systematically.
5023660 5027494 l know there's scum around,<br />or bivouacked near the camp, waiting...
5027564 5030465 ...for someone to deliver this loot.
5030534 5034300 But as long as l'm commandant,<br />l won't permit any such trickery!
5034338 5035930 Am l clear?
5037741 5039038 Yes, sir.
5039209 5042303 Just as long as you're the commandant.
5043380 5044938 Yes, sergeant.
5047818 5051151 l know this leg means<br />l won't last very long...
5051221 5054088 ...but l pray l can manage<br />to have enough time...
5054157 5059151 ...to amass evidence and bring to a<br />court-martial all those who discredit...
5059863 5062457 ...and dishonor the uniform...
5062699 5064394 ...of the Union!
5068638 5070333 l wish you luck.
5104975 5107808 You and the others better lay low<br />for a few days.
5109112 5112707 l'll keep this. You go.<br />Wallace will let you know.
5125128 5127596 -Bring me Carson.<br />-Right.
5142145 5145137 Angel Eyes said for us<br />to lay low for a few days.
5145449 5148475 But we'll keep close enough<br />to keep an eye on things.
5148885 5150819 Come on, saddle your horses.
5161565 5162930 Come on in, Tuco.
5163700 5165190 Don't be bashful.
5166102 5168366 There's no formalities, here.
5179683 5181651 lt's been a long time!
5185288 5186482 You're hungry.
5187491 5189152 Sit down. Eat!
5208612 5210375 l knew it, l knew it!
5212215 5214376 The minute l saw you, l said to myself:
5215519 5217919 ''Look at that pig, Angel Eyes...
5219356 5221790 ''...l'll bet he's got himself an easy job!
5225161 5227152 ''And he never forgets a friend!''
5228031 5230158 l never forget old friends, Tuco.
5234137 5236105 lt's good to see old friends again.
5239376 5242038 Especially when they come<br />from so far away...
5242812 5245076 ...and have so much to talk about.
5246616 5249483 And you do have a lot to talk about,<br />haven't you?
5252088 5253715 You were captured near...
5254124 5255148 ...Fort Craig?
5259996 5262726 lf you were with Sibley,<br />then you were...
5263667 5265362 ...coming from Santa Fe?
5277981 5279812 Was it hard crossing the desert?
5280684 5281708 Very hard!
5283587 5286181 Especially if you don't have<br />anything to drink.
5288892 5291793 Why are you going under the name<br />of Bill Carson, now?
5297534 5299798 One name is as good as another.
5300270 5302261 Not wise to use your own name.
5303306 5306707 Like you, l bet they don't call you<br />Angel Eyes.
5307777 5309642 Sergeant Angel Eyes.
5318722 5320986 Like a little music with your meal, Tuco?
5321858 5322825 Music?
5323426 5326452 Yes, very good for the digestion.
5342012 5344105 Bill Carson's a fake name, huh?
5350153 5351711 That fake, too?
5353456 5355924 Bill Carson's name is written on it.
5357627 5358958 Have some.
5359796 5361821 lt's Bill Carson's tobacco.
