189732 194028 I don't understand.<br />I just don't understand.
238573 242660 I don't understand it at all.
244495 246247 I just don't understand.
267685 269187 What's wrong?
272398 274484 What don't you understand?
277862 280698 I've never heard<br />such a strange story.
281240 283659 Why don't you<br />tell me about it?
284494 289373 We happen to have<br />a wise priest in our midst.
291167 297131 No, not even the renowned,<br />wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple
297840 301219 has heard a story<br />as strange as this.
302553 306140 So you know something<br />about this strange story?
306224 311729 This man and I have just seen it<br />and heard it ourselves.
311813 313564 Where?
314065 316067 In the courthouse garden.
316150 317819 The courthouse?
319237 321656 A man was murdered.
321739 325409 Just one? So what?
326369 329163 On top of this gate,
329622 333376 you'll find at least<br />five or six unclaimed bodies.
334377 336128 You're right.
336504 341801 War, earthquake, winds,
342593 346681 fire, famine, the plague...
347265 350768 Year after year,<br />it's been nothing but disasters.
355106 360444 And bandits descend upon us<br />every night.
361821 365366 I've seen so many men
365449 369704 getting killed like insects,
370955 376586 but even I have never heard<br />a story as horrible as this.
383259 386846 Yes. So horrible.
390766 392977 This time,
393811 397273 I may finally lose<br />my faith in the human soul.
397815 403821 It's worse than bandits,<br />the plague,
404697 409452 famine, fire, or war.
409994 412330 Look here, priest.
412914 415082 Enough with the sermon.
415166 419712 It sounded interesting,<br />at least while I kept out of the rain.
420004 424550 But if it's a sermon,<br />I'd sooner listen to the rain.
455831 458542 Hear me out.
458793 461337 Maybe you can tell me<br />what it means.
461420 465800 I don't understand<br />any of those three.
465883 468719 - Which three?<br />- Well -
469428 471973 I'll tell you about them.
472056 475059 Calm down<br />and tell me slowly.
475977 478896 The rain's not going to stop<br />any time soon.
479981 482483 RASHOMON
499083 501085 It was three days ago.
501669 505715 I went into the mountains<br />to get wood.
727728 730356 I ran as fast as I could<br />to tell the police.
731523 736362 Then, three days later - today,<br />I was called to testily
738072 740908 Yes, that's right.
744787 750501 I was the one<br />who first found the body.
750751 754004 What?<br />Did I see a sword or something?
754088 756924 No, nothing at all.
759009 762513 Just a woman's hat<br />caught on a branch,
763180 766850 and the cap of a samurai<br />that had been trampled on.
767434 771814 There was a cut-up piece of rope<br />near the body,
772856 776443 and further along in the leaves,
776527 780114 a shiny amulet case<br />with red lining.
780197 781865 Yes.
783200 788539 That was all I found, yes.
790457 792084 Yes.
793752 798924 I met the murdered man<br />before his death.
799842 805806 It was three days ago,<br />in the afternoon.
807474 811729 On the road from Sekiyama<br />to Yamashina.
829663 833917 The woman had a veil,
834585 836754 so I couldn't see her face.
837379 841842 The man was armed<br />with a sword,
841925 844595 as well as a bow and arrows.
847931 850059 Little did I expect
850684 855647 that he would meet such a fate.
857441 861195 A human life is truly as frail
861278 864573 and fleeting<br />as the morning dew.
866617 870454 What a shame<br />that his should end this way.
871205 873791 I'm sorry.
877461 882132 This man I caught is Tajomaru.
882966 888263 Yes, the notorious bandit<br />everyone speaks of.
890557 895562 The last time I almost caught him,<br />he looked the same
895646 898148 and he carried that same sword.
900359 904822 It was two days ago at dusk,<br />by the banks of the Katsura...
922214 925217 What's wrong?
936687 940774 There were 17 arrows<br />with eagle feathers,
941483 945487 a leather bow, and a horse.
946363 950200 All these belonged<br />to the dead man, yes.
952327 957958 The irony of Tajomaru being<br />thrown off his stolen horse,
958041 961044 this had to be fateful retribution.
968760 971221 I fell off the horse?
972347 974057 You fool!
977603 979229 On that day...
987946 991575 I was riding that horse<br />and I was suddenly very thirsty.
992242 994536 So around Osaka,<br />I drank from a spring.
1007549 1010677 There must have been<br />a dead poisonous snake upstream.
1010761 1014598 After a while, I got<br />an incredible stomachache.
1014890 1020020 By the time I came to the river,<br />I couldn't hold it any longer.
1020771 1024816 So I got off the horse<br />and crouched in the field.
1029530 1031865 I fell off?
1032866 1035953 Obviously, a fool can think<br />only foolish thoughts.
1038747 1042709 I know sooner or later<br />you'll have my neck,
1043126 1045462 so I'm not going to<br />hide anything.
1048257 1051468 It was this Tajomaru<br />who killed that man.
1054137 1058225 I saw that couple three days ago.<br />It was a hot afternoon.
1058767 1062896 Suddenly a cool breeze<br />rustled the leaves.
1063689 1068569 If it hadn't been for that wind,<br />I wouldn't have killed him.
1222431 1227185 I caught a glimpse<br />and then she was gone.
1227644 1230063 Maybe that's why.
1230397 1233525 I thought I saw a goddess.
1233608 1236069 At that moment<br />I decided to capture her,
1236153 1238321 even if I had to kill her man.
1240866 1246413 But if I could have her<br />without killing, all the better.
1246496 1252294 My intention then was to take her<br />without killing the man.
1253962 1257632 But I couldn't do it<br />on that road to Yamashina.
1274608 1276276 What do you want?
1288997 1290499 What do you want?
1301718 1303220 What is it?
1323740 1325408 Don't be suspicious.
1328995 1331706 See? Isn't this nice?
1334376 1336503 Take a good look at it.
1342342 1347180 There are some ruins over there.
1347764 1350058 When I dug up the mound,
1350141 1354354 I found a heap of<br />swords and mirrors.
1354437 1357065 I buried them in a grove<br />behind the mountain
1357148 1359484 so no one else would find them.
1360277 1363280 If you're interested,<br />I'll sell them to you cheap.
1459000 1460877 It's over there.
1463338 1465173 Walk ahead of me.
1509259 1512762 It's here.<br />Beyond those pines.
1626876 1630880 Your husband has taken sick.
1638888 1642058 Her face turned pale.
1642142 1646187 She stared at me<br />with frozen eyes,
1646271 1650567 her expression<br />intense like a child's.
1651276 1652861 When I saw that,
1652944 1656489 I envied the man<br />and I suddenly hated him.
1656573 1661119 I wanted to show her how pathetic<br />he looked tied to that pine tree.
1661202 1665832 These thoughts that weren't there<br />before filled my head.
1759676 1763429 I had never seen<br />such fierceness in a woman.
1906114 1911202 And so I had succeeded in having her<br />without killing her husband.
1915331 1920545 I still had no intention<br />of killing him.
1921921 1923506 But then...
1925383 1926884 Wait!
1928511 1930096 Stop!
1931180 1936144 Either you die<br />or my husband dies.
1936644 1938729 One of you must die.
1949282 1954954 To have my shame known<br />to two men is worse than dying.
1957874 1961961 I will go
1962044 1966340 with the survivor.
2141432 2144769 So I had to kill him,<br />but I wanted to do it honorably.
2144852 2147438 He fought very well.
2147772 2150441 We crossed swords 23 times.
2150775 2155738 I remember this<br />because I'm still impressed.
2156113 2159742 No one had ever crossed swords<br />with me more than 20 times.
2164163 2167416 What? The woman?
2169085 2170836 I don't know.
2171504 2176050 When the man died,<br />I turned to her.
2176425 2178511 She was gone.
2179053 2184141 The fighting must have scared her<br />and she ran away.
2184517 2187728 I ran out to the mountain road.
2187812 2191023 All I found was her horse<br />grazing calmly.
2191857 2195528 I was attracted<br />to her fierce spirit,
2196570 2199990 but, after all,<br />she was just like other women.
2200366 2202952 I didn't even look for her.
2205496 2208874 What? His sword?
2210000 2213254 I exchanged it in town for liquor.
2214422 2217550 What? Her dagger?
2220344 2226308 It had pearl inlay.<br />Looked very valuable.
2227017 2229687 I totally forgot about it.
2230604 2232857 That was foolish.
2232940 2235234 The biggest mistake<br />I ever made!
2257256 2259383 Even amongst the bandits,
2259467 2263888 Tajomaru is famous<br />for being a womanizer.
2264597 2269560 Why, last fall,<br />a young wife went to the temple
2269643 2274440 and she and her maid were<br />found dead in the mountains.
2274523 2276692 That must have been him too.
2282782 2287912 Who knows what really happened<br />to that woman who left her horse?
2288704 2290539 Well,
2293417 2297254 that woman showed up<br />at the courthouse.
2300090 2306055 She was hiding in the temple<br />when the police found her.
2306305 2307807 It's a lie.
2308849 2313103 It's all a lie.<br />Tajomaru's story and the woman's.
2313729 2316440 It's human to lie.
2320277 2323697 Most of the time we can't even<br />be honest with ourselves.
2323781 2325741 That may be.
2331413 2336210 But it's because men are weak<br />that they lie,
2336293 2340256 even to themselves.
2340339 2342007 Not another sermon.
2343259 2348430 I don't care if it's a lie,<br />as long as it's entertaining.
2350558 2352768 What story did the woman<br />come up with?
2354186 2359733 Well, it's completely different<br />from Tajomaru's story.
2361360 2363320 So different
2363404 2369368 that her face didn't even<br />show the fierceness he spoke of.
2376166 2379795 She was so docile,<br />she was almost pitiful.
2408032 2410910 That man in the blue kimono,
2413495 2416165 after forcing me to yield to him,
2417666 2423422 proudly announced that<br />he was the infamous Tajomaru,
2426550 2431430 and laughed mockingly<br />at my husband who was tied up.
2441523 2443442 How horrified
2446070 2449698 my husband must have been.
2453243 2456413 The more he struggled,
2458999 2465965 the tighter the ropes dug in.
2469218 2472054 I ran to his side.
2472429 2476266 Or rather, I tried to.
2584291 2586210 Even now,
2588337 2590839 when I think of his eyes,
2591715 2595886 my blood turns cold in my veins.
2599389 2604103 What I saw in them was<br />neither anger,
2605354 2609316 nor sorrow,
2611527 2617491 but a cold light,<br />a look of loathing.
2625040 2626708 Don't.
2627334 2629711 Don't look at me like that.
2634758 2636426 It's too cruel.
2637719 2639972 Beat me,
2640889 2643142 kill me,
2643225 2648147 but don't look at me like that.<br />Please, stop.
2732272 2734524 Now kill me.
2735984 2738195 Kill me at once.
2772187 2773772 Stop.
2775023 2776275 Don't.
2782239 2783865 Please don't.
2827909 2834833 I must have fainted after that.
2843050 2845802 When I came to<br />and looked around...
2854102 2856772 Imagine my shock.
2870285 2876249 I saw my dagger
2877793 2882672 in my dead husband's chest.
2896436 2900690 I was in shock
2903193 2906696 and I don't remember<br />how I left the woods.
2912285 2914913 But when I came to,
2918208 2924172 I was standing by the pond<br />at the foot of the hill.
2931263 2934099 I threw myself into the pond.
2935851 2939521 I tried many different things.
2941565 2946445 But I failed to kill myself.
2958373 2962878 What should a poor,
2964963 2970385 helpless woman like me do?
3005212 3009049 I see. The more I hear,<br />the more confused I get.
3011259 3015013 But women use their tears<br />to fool everyone.
3015096 3017599 They even fool themselves.
3018433 3022395 So you have to beware<br />of the woman's story.
3024064 3027150 When you hear<br />the dead man's story -
3027234 3029277 He's dead.
3030278 3033073 How can he tell his story?
3033156 3035867 He spoke through a medium.
3037202 3038954 Lies.
3039663 3041831 His story was also lies.
3043625 3048296 But dead men don't lie.
3048964 3050840 Why is that?
3052634 3055887 I refuse to believe<br />that man would be so sinful.
3057264 3059683 Suit yourself.
3059766 3062644 But is there anyone who's<br />really good?
3062727 3065480 Maybe goodness is<br />just make-believe.
3065564 3067399 What a frightening -
3068358 3071778 Man just wants to forget<br />the bad stuff
3071861 3074155 and believe in the<br />made-up good stuff.
3074239 3077576 It's easier that way.<br />- Ridiculous.
3080996 3085834 Never mind.<br />Let's hear the dead man's story.
3132881 3136051 I am in darkness now.
3136468 3141431 I am suffering in the dark.
3141723 3146603 Cursed be those who cast me<br />into this dark hell.
3184599 3189521 After the bandit<br />attacked my wife,
3189604 3192190 he tried to console her.
3193775 3198947 She sat on the leaves,<br />staring down at her knees.
3199781 3203159 The bandit was cunning.
3203660 3205870 Now that her virtue was stained,
3205954 3208790 she could no longer be<br />with her husband
3208873 3212836 Leave the husband<br />and why not marry him instead?
3212919 3217382 He said he only attacked her<br />out of his love for her.
3218007 3220552 When she heard that,
3220635 3223972 my wife raised her face<br />as if in a trance.
3229561 3235275 She had never looked so beautiful.
3241823 3247787 And what was my beautiful wife's<br />response to the bandit
3247871 3252083 in front of her helpless husband?
3255503 3257213 Wherever.
3259841 3262427 Take me wherever you want.
3264429 3266639 That's what she said.
3269809 3273104 But that wasn't her only sin
3273188 3277817 or I wouldn't be suffering<br />in the dark like this.
3292874 3294876 Please kill him.
3294959 3298171 While he's alive,<br />I cannot go with you.
3298838 3300757 Kill him!
3301966 3305804 Those words were<br />like a wind that
3305887 3310016 threatened to blow me<br />into the depths of darkness.
3315063 3322612 Has such a hateful thing<br />ever been uttered by a human before?
3323112 3327200 Even the bandit turned pale<br />at those words.
3328785 3333706 Please kill him.
3368950 3372495 What do you want me<br />to do with her?
3373329 3378918 Kill her or save her?<br />You only have to nod.
3382463 3385508 For these words alone,
3385592 3389053 I was ready to pardon his crime.
3393308 3397312 Kill her or let her go?
3425882 3429344 I don't know<br />how many hours passed.
3471928 3473763 She got away.
3474305 3477016 Now I'll have to worry about<br />my own fate.
3502083 3504085 Everything was silent.
3505670 3508881 I heard someone crying.
3510049 3512635 Someone is crying.
3513594 3516347 Who is that?
3661659 3663744 Everything was silent.
3665663 3668124 How quiet it was.
3669876 3672879 Suddenly the sun went away.
3674505 3678968 I was enveloped in deep silence.
3681095 3686184 I lay there in the stillness.
3688728 3694108 Then someone<br />quietly approached me.
3695151 3700948 That someone<br />gently withdrew the dagger
3702575 3705995 from my heart.
3734899 3736484 It's not true!
3736567 3741322 There was no dagger.<br />He was killed by a sword.
3779235 3781988 Now it's getting interesting.
3782071 3787368 It seems you saw the whole thing.
3791539 3794417 So why didn't you tell the court?
3795543 3797962 I didn't want to get involved.
3798045 3800548 You can talk about it here, right?
3801590 3803259 Tell me, then.
3803342 3806470 Your story seems to be<br />the most interesting.
3806554 3811392 I don't want to hear it.<br />No more horror stories.
3812101 3814729 They are common stories<br />these days.
3814812 3816689 I even heard that
3816772 3821277 the demon living here in Rashomon<br />fled in fear of the ferocity of man.
3824905 3829327 Come on.<br />How much do you know?
3834248 3838044 I found the woman's hat<br />in the mountains.
3838127 3839920 You already said that.
3842423 3847887 About 20 yards further,<br />I heard a woman crying.
3848471 3850973 From behind a bush,
3851474 3856062 I saw a man tied up,<br />a woman crying and Tajomaru.
3857813 3862360 So you lied when you said<br />you found the body.
3862443 3865529 I didn't want to get involved.
3867448 3869950 All right, then. Go on.
3870493 3873120 What was Tajomaru doing?
3876165 3881045 He was down on his knees,<br />begging the woman for forgiveness.
3884006 3888886 Until now, whenever I wanted<br />to do something bad, I did it.
3888969 3891806 That way I suffered less.
3892640 3894809 But today, it's different.
3895267 3899397 I already had you,<br />but I only want you more.
3899480 3901524 It's very hard.
3901607 3904610 I beg you to be my wife.
3908489 3911534 The notorious bandit Tajomaru
3914078 3916831 is begging you<br />on his hands and knees.
3920084 3924046 If you wish,<br />I'll even stop being a bandit.
3924130 3928300 I have enough stashed away<br />to give you a lavish life.
3928384 3932555 And if you don't want my dirty money,<br />I'll even work.
3933055 3936892 I'll stoop to selling odds and ends<br />on the street to support you.
3937560 3942398 I'll do anything<br />if you come with me.
3943482 3946360 Marry me, please.
3948446 3953534 If you say no,<br />I have no choice but to kill you.
3955077 3957538 Please, say yes.
3961417 3964628 Stop crying and answer me.
3964712 3966797 Tell me you'll be my wife!
3967214 3969216 Say it!
3981520 3983522 It's impossible.
3984899 3990654 How could I, a woman,<br />say anything?
4010591 4014428 I get it. You mean<br />it's up to us men to decide.
4017056 4018849 Hold it!
4019600 4024271 I refuse to risk my life<br />for such a woman.
4051632 4055844 You've been with two men.<br />Why don't you kill yourself?
4061183 4063310 Hopeless.
4066355 4070609 I don't want this shameless whore.<br />You can have her.
4071944 4076574 At this stage, I'd rather lose her<br />instead of the horse.
4132296 4133839 Wait!
4133922 4135549 Don't follow me!
4148187 4152566 Stop crying.<br />It's not going to work anymore.
4154443 4157655 Stop it. Don't bully her.
4158697 4161784 Women are weak by nature.
4188268 4190229 It's you who are weak.
4192898 4198862 If you are my husband,<br />why don't you kill this man?
4199363 4203158 Then you can tell me to kill myself.<br />That's a real man.
4204368 4207121 You're not a real man either.
4215295 4219299 When I heard you were Tajomaru,<br />I stopped crying.
4219383 4222386 I was sick of this<br />tiresome daily farce.
4223387 4229101 I thought, "Tajomaru might<br />get me out of this."
4229601 4235232 "If he'd only save me,<br />I'd do anything for him."
4235315 4237317 I thought to myself.
4241947 4245659 But you were just as petty<br />as my husband.
4246952 4248412 Just remember:
4248495 4252499 A woman loves a man<br />who loves passionately.
4253000 4256503 A man has to make a woman his<br />by his sword.
4596510 4599096 I don't want to die!
4766429 4769140 So that's the real story.
4769224 4772102 I don't tell lies.<br />I saw it with my own eyes.
4772185 4774062 I doubt it.
4774145 4776564 It's true. I don't lie.
4776648 4779067 No one lies after he says<br />he's going to do so.
4779150 4780986 It's horrifying.
4781069 4784155 If men don't trust each other,<br />this earth might as well be hell.
4784239 4785782 That's right.<br />This world is hell.
4785865 4788201 No, I believe in men.
4789744 4792247 I don't want this place to be hell.
4792956 4795375 Shouting doesn't help.
4795458 4799629 Think about it. Out of these three,<br />whose story is believable?
4799713 4803591 No idea.
4804801 4809514 In the end, you cannot<br />understand the things men do.
4871368 4872952 What are you doing?
4877165 4879125 What's it to you?
4881795 4884672 - That's terrible!<br />- Terrible?
4884756 4887842 Someone else would have<br />taken the kimono.
4887926 4890136 Why shouldn't I?
4890887 4893431 - It's evil.<br />- Evil?
4893848 4896559 What about this kid's parents?
4897060 4901606 They had their fun<br />and then they throw out the kid?
4901689 4903483 They're evil.
4903566 4905944 No, you're wrong.
4907070 4910490 Look at the amulet<br />on the kimono.
4910573 4913576 It was left to protect the baby.
4913660 4916246 Think about what they went through<br />to abandon this baby.
4916329 4919249 I don't have time to mind<br />everyone's feelings.
4919332 4922836 - You selfish -<br />- What's wrong with that?
4922919 4926089 Dogs are better off in this world.
4926172 4929342 If you're not selfish,<br />you can't survive.
4938184 4940395 Damn it.
4941354 4945024 Everyone is selfish<br />and dishonest.
4945108 4948111 Making excuses.
4948736 4954033 The bandit,<br />the woman, the man
4955785 4957454 and you!
4963918 4967922 And you aren't?<br />That's funny.
4968339 4973303 You may have fooled the court,<br />but not me.
4989569 4992530 So what did you do<br />with the dagger?
4993031 4995492 The valuable one<br />with the pearl inlay
4995575 4998244 that Tajomaru was talking about?
4998745 5001748 What happened to it?<br />Did it disappear in the grass?
5002749 5007086 If you didn't, who stole it?
5010256 5012383 It seems I'm right.
5015428 5019766 A bandit calling another a bandit.<br />Now that's selfish.
5033655 5037116 Do you have<br />anything else to say?
5037867 5039869 If not, I'll be going.
5117405 5121284 What are you doing?<br />Taking what little it has left?
5131210 5135715 I have six kids of my own.
5136883 5144140 Another one<br />wouldn't make a difference.
5151439 5158029 I am ashamed of what I said.
5161240 5163076 It's inevitable
5163493 5169207 to be suspicious of others<br />on a day like this.
5173127 5175630 I'm the one<br />who should be ashamed.
5177423 5182095 I don't understand my own soul.
5182178 5185473 No, I'm grateful to you.
5198444 5202448 Thanks to you,
5204200 5208538 I think I can keep<br />my faith in man.
5209372 5211040 Don't mention it.
5308012 5312600 THE END
