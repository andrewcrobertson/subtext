167793 172131 I can't understand it.<br />I can't understand it at all
216884 220888 I just can't understand it
222347 224183 I just can't fathom it
245621 247623 What's the matter?
250292 252294 What can't you understand?
255964 258634 The strangest thing I ever heard of
259343 261345 Tell me about it
262554 267351 It's just as well we have<br />a wise priest here
269269 275234 Even Abbot Konin of the Kiyomizu Temple,<br />renowned for his learning...
275359 278904 ...wouldn't be able<br />to understand this
279029 283367 So you know something about it, too?
284034 289581 Today I've heard it with my own ears,<br />seen it with my own eyes
289706 293794 - Where?<br />- In the prison courtyard
293919 295587 The prison?
297422 299633 A man has been murdered
299758 303428 What of it? One or two more...
304054 308725 Only one? You'll always find bodies<br />left on the top of this gate
309434 311436 No one bothers about them
312437 314523 Yes, you are right
314648 320112 Wars, earthquakes, great winds...
320571 324783 ...fires, famine, plague...
325450 328787 ...each year is full of disasters
333250 335252 And now, every night...
335919 337921 ...bandits prey on us
339923 345929 I've seen hundreds of men dying,<br />killed like animals
348640 354605 Yet even I have never heard anything<br />as horrible before
361320 364656 It's horrible
368660 374666 There was never anything<br />as terrible as this
375334 381381 It is more horrible<br />than fires or wars...
382674 386678 ...or epidemics, or bandits
388013 390015 Come on, priest...
390682 392684 ...spare us the sermons
393393 397397 I only wanted to hear the story<br />to pass the time until the rain stops
398065 402069 But I'd sooner listen to the rain<br />than any sermons from you
433725 436603 Hey, listen to me
436728 443610 Perhaps you can tell me what it<br />all means. All three of them...
443735 449741 - Three?<br />- The three I wanted to tell you about
449866 452828 All right, but take it easy
453870 456164 This rain won't stop yet
476852 479396 It was three days ago
479521 483525 I'd gone to the hills to cut wood
705664 709209 <i>I ran to tell the police</i>
710543 715215 <i>That was three days ago.<br />Today I was called to give evidence</i>
717217 719219 Yes, sir
722681 727936 It was me who found the body
730230 734693 Was there a sword?<br />No, nothing like that
736987 743285 All I saw was a woman's hat,<br />caught on a branch
745370 749541 And a man's hat that had been<br />trodden on
750875 757382 And a piece of rope...<br />and an amulet case of red brocade
761344 766308 Yes, sir, that was all I saw.<br />I swear it
771604 776276 I saw the murdered man<br />when he was still alive
777652 782282 It was about three days ago,<br />in the afternoon
783450 789914 It was on the road between<br />Sekiyama and Yamashina
807515 813813 <i>Her hat had a veil.<br />I couldn't see her face</i>
815190 821821 <i>The man was armed.<br />He had a sword, bow and arrows</i>
825825 829245 I never expected to see him again.
829371 832874 Then, to see him dead like that...
835335 841883 True, life is ephemeral,<br />as fleeting as the morning dew
845929 851226 But the pity of it, what a pity<br />he should have died like that
855230 859901 Yes, it was me who caught Tajomaru
862404 864614 The notorious bandit
868618 871913 He was dressed as you see him now...
872622 875959 ...carrying that Korean sword
878628 883299 It was the day before yesterday,<br />on the riverbank at Katsura
914706 920712 <i>There was a black-lacquered quiver<br />holding seventeen arrows, and a bow</i>
921379 923381 <i>And there was a grey horse</i>
924424 928761 They all belonged<br />to the murdered man
930763 935935 Imagine a bandit like Tajomaru being<br />thrown by the horse he had stolen!
936060 938521 It was retribution
946946 951451 Retribution? Don't be stupid!
955455 957457 On that day...
966382 969719 ...I suddenly became very thirsty
970261 973056 So I stopped to drink at a stream
985652 988696 There must have been a snake<br />or something upstream...
988821 992659 ...because soon<br />I had a terrible bellyache
992784 997664 I had to get off the horse<br />and lie down
998915 1002627 And you thought I'd fallen off!
1007840 1013304 You must be a stupid idiot<br />to get such a stupid idea!
1016849 1022939 I'm telling the truth. I know<br />you'll cut my head off sooner or later
1026276 1028903 It was me, Tajomaru, who killed him
1032240 1035618 I saw them in the hot afternoon,<br />about three days ago
1036953 1040290 Suddenly, there was this cool breeze
1041624 1046296 If it wasn't for that breeze<br />I wouldn't have killed him
1200450 1204454 Just a glimpse, then she was gone
1205621 1210835 I thought I'd seen an angel.<br />There and then I decided to have her
1211627 1215631 I'd have her<br />even if I had to kill the man
1219010 1224307 But it would be even better<br />if I could do it without killing him
1224432 1230313 So I decided to get the woman<br />alone somehow
1232023 1235318 The road to Yamashina was<br />hardly the place, though
1252543 1254504 What is it?
1301634 1303636 Isn't that splendid?
1307014 1309642 Just look
1312353 1314355 Here, take it
1323239 1327368 Near here, I found an old tomb<br />with lots of such things in it
1327493 1331789 Swords, daggers, mirrors
1331914 1336252 I've buried them.<br />No one but me knows where
1338254 1340923 I could sell you some cheap
1436811 1438646 It's over in that grove
1441148 1443150 Walk ahead of me
1487403 1490573 It's over there
1604019 1605813 It's your husband...
1607481 1609984 A snake has bitten your husband
1616824 1623164 She went pale and stared at me<br />as though her eyes were frozen
1624081 1627918 She looked like a child<br />when suddenly it turns serious
1629295 1634466 That made me jealous of that man,<br />I began to hate him
1634592 1638596 I wanted to show her<br />what he looked like, tied up like that
1639305 1643684 I didn't think of such a thing before,<br />but now I did
1739071 1741490 She was fierce, determined
1884425 1889096 I had her, just as I had planned,<br />and without killing the husband
1893434 1898480 Besides, I hadn't intended to kill him
1900065 1901775 But then...
1903360 1904695 Wait!
1909158 1911702 One of you must die
1911827 1915831 Either you or my husband
1927217 1932681 To be doubly disgraced before two men<br />is more than I can bear
1937561 1944485 I will belong to whoever kills the other
2119284 2124623 I wanted to kill him fairly,<br />and he fought really well
2125707 2128502 We crossed swords<br />more than twenty times
2128627 2133298 No one had ever crossed more<br />than twenty times with me before
2133965 2137344 Then I killed him
2141973 2145352 What's that? The woman?
2151066 2155696 She was nowhere to be seen
2157364 2161910 She probably took fright<br />and ran away
2162577 2165914 She must have been in a state
2166039 2169376 Anyhow, when I came back,<br />I found the horse grazing there
2170043 2173380 It was the woman's temper<br />that interested me
2174715 2177426 But she was just like any other woman
2178719 2180721 I didn't even look for her
2183432 2186727 What? His sword?
2188061 2191440 I sold that and drank up the money
2192441 2195444 Her dagger?
2197821 2204119 I remember, it looked valuable,<br />with a kind of inlay in it
2204786 2210167 I forgot all about it.<br />What a stupid thing to do
2210792 2212794 My biggest mistake
2235400 2241531 Tajomaru, he's notorious,<br />worse than all the other bandits in Kyoto
2242824 2247537 Last autumn, a girl and her maid went<br />to worship at the Toribe Temple
2247662 2254211 They were found murdered.<br />He must have done it
2260884 2265597 The woman left her horse behind?<br />I bet he killed her
2266890 2268517 Yes, but...
2271603 2274898 But she gave evidence, too
2278276 2283615 She sought refuge in a temple<br />and the police found her there
2284282 2285617 It's a lie!
2286952 2290956 All lies: Tajomaru's confession,<br />the woman's story
2291873 2294960 People are only people,<br />that's why they lie
2298296 2301550 They can't even admit the truth<br />to themselves
2301675 2304302 That may be true
2309516 2312978 It's because men are so weak
2314354 2318233 That's why they lie,<br />to deceive themselves
2318358 2319943 Not another sermon!
2321361 2326366 I don't mind a lie,<br />not if it's interesting
2328702 2331037 What was her story?
2332372 2337043 It was quite different<br />from the bandit's
2339045 2340714 Everything was different
2341756 2347762 Tajomaru talked of her temper,<br />her strength. I saw nothing like that
2354436 2357647 She was pitiful,<br />I felt great compassion for her
2382172 2388053 Then...<br />after taking advantage of me...
2391473 2393433 ...he said, so proudly...
2395602 2401191 ...he was the famous bandit Tajomaru
2404319 2408990 Then he sneered at my husband
2424089 2427008 How terrible it must have been for him
2431012 2434391 But the more he struggled...
2437018 2439688 ...the tighter the rope became
2442399 2443692 I couldn't stand it
2447070 2453743 Not realizing what I was doing,<br />I ran towards him, or tried to
2562227 2563853 And...
2566356 2572654 Even now I remember his eyes
2577325 2581996 What I saw in them<br />was not sorrow
2583331 2586000 It was not even anger
2589337 2595343 Not even pity.<br />It was a cold hatred of me
2602934 2607105 Don't look at me like that
2612735 2614154 Don't!
2615738 2620702 Beat me, kill me,<br />but don't look at me like that
2623288 2625290 Please don't
2710166 2716256 Then kill me if you will.<br />Kill me with one stroke, quickly
2750164 2751749 Please don't
2805928 2807722 And then I...
2810600 2812602 Then I fainted
2820943 2823237 When I recovered<br />and looked around...
2832163 2835166 Then I saw him
2851849 2859816 I saw the dagger<br />in my husband's chest
2874580 2878501 I ran and ran and ran<br />through the forest...
2881087 2884215 I must have,<br />although I don't remember
2890304 2892306 When I came to my senses...
2896227 2898354 ...I found myself by a pool...
2899981 2902358 ...outside the forest
2909699 2912368 I threw myself in
2913703 2917498 I tried to kill myself<br />in other ways, too
2919542 2923838 But I failed in my attempts
2936309 2940646 I was just a helpless woman...
2942899 2948529 Your Honour, what is a poor<br />helpless woman like me to do?
2984232 2987276 The more I hear,<br />the more confused I am
2989237 2995243 Women lead you on with their tears,<br />they even fool themselves
2996369 2999705 If I believed her,<br />I'd be really mixed up
3001707 3004919 But according to the husband's story...
3005044 3010424 But he's dead.<br />How could a dead man talk?
3011050 3013719 He spoke through a medium
3015054 3019183 Lies! His story was all lies
3021727 3025982 But dead men tell no lies
3026899 3029110 Why is that, priest?
3030736 3033781 They must not.<br />I must not believe men are so sinful
3035408 3039787 Oh, I don't mind that
3040746 3043124 After all, who's honest nowadays?
3043249 3044834 How awful...
3046335 3053551 Everyone wants to forget nasty things,<br />so they invent stories, it's easier
3053676 3055761 Don't be so foolish
3059015 3063603 Never mind.<br />Let's hear the dead man's story
3110858 3113944 I am in darkness now
3114570 3118574 I am suffering in the darkness
3119700 3124580 Cursed be those who cast me<br />into this hell of darkness
3162618 3165871 The bandit,<br />after attacking my wife...
3165996 3169875 ...sat down beside her<br />and tried to console her
3171836 3176674 <i>She sat there on the leaves,<br />looking down, saying nothing</i>
3178050 3180928 <i>The bandit was cunning</i>
3182054 3186267 <i>He said she could no longer live<br />with her husband now</i>
3186392 3190855 <i>Why not go with him, rather than<br />Stay and suffer with her husband?</i>
3190980 3195985 <i>He said he had attacked<br />only because of his great love for her</i>
3196110 3199280 <i>My wife looked at him...</i>
3199405 3202116 <i>...her face soft, her eyes veiled</i>
3207663 3213252 <i>Never in our life together<br />had I seen her look more beautiful</i>
3219800 3222344 <i>And my beautiful wife...</i>
3224180 3230060 <i>...what did she reply to the bandit,<br />before her helpless husband?</i>
3233481 3240029 Take me. Take me away with you
3242406 3244700 That is what she said
3247787 3251248 But that is not all she did...
3251373 3255753 ...or else I would not now be<br />in darkness
3270726 3275481 Kill him. As long as he is alive,<br />I cannot go with you
3276857 3278692 Kill him for me!
3280194 3287451 Even now, her words cast me<br />into a pit of darkness
3293040 3300256 Have such vile, accursed words<br />ever been spoken before?
3301298 3305344 Even the bandit was shocked<br />to hear such pitiless words
3306804 3308430 Kill him!
3346886 3349972 What do you want me to do<br />with this woman?
3351432 3356353 Kill her? Spare her?<br />Nod your head to tell me
3360524 3366280 <i>For those words,<br />I almost forgave the bandit</i>
3369825 3374955 What do you want?<br />Shall I kill her? Let her go?
3403943 3407696 <i>Hours later...<br />I don't know how long</i>
3450072 3453742 She got away.<br />Now she'll tell everyone
3479935 3482479 <i>It was quiet</i>
3483939 3486692 <i>Then I heard someone crying</i>
3640053 3646059 Everything was quiet.<br />How quiet it was
3647895 3650564 Darkness fell...
3652566 3656570 ...and a mist seemed to envelop me
3659239 3663911 I lay quietly in this stillness
3666830 3671501 Then someone seemed<br />to approach me. Softly, gently
3673003 3674546 Who could it be?
3675005 3679009 Then someone's hand<br />grasped the dagger...
3680761 3683722 ...and drew it out
3712918 3718715 It's not true, there was no dagger.<br />He was killed by a sword
3757254 3759840 Now it's getting interesting
3761800 3765012 You must have seen the whole thing
3769516 3772102 Why didn't you tell the police?
3773395 3775939 I didn't want to get involved
3776064 3778400 But now you want to talk about it?
3779568 3784448 Go on, then. Your story seems<br />to be the most interesting
3784573 3788952 I don't want to listen<br />to any more horrible stories
3790078 3792664 Such stories are commonplace now
3792789 3798795 Even the castle demons fled, because<br />they were horrified by what men do
3802799 3807471 How much of this story do you know?
3812267 3815896 I found a woman's hat
3816021 3817773 So you said
3820317 3824946 After I'd walked a little further,<br />I heard a woman crying
3826281 3832954 From behind a bush I saw her,<br />a man tied up...and Tajomaru, too
3833622 3840087 So what you said<br />about finding the body was a lie?
3840212 3842964 I didn't want to get involved
3845425 3849429 Go on.<br />What was Tajomaru doing?
3854184 3858980 He was in front of the woman and<br />he seemed to be begging her forgiveness
3861900 3866613 Until now, if I wanted to do<br />something bad, I did it
3866738 3869324 It was good if it was for me
3870617 3872994 But today is different
3873120 3879292 I've had you already, but I want you<br />more and more, and I suffer
3879418 3882045 Come away with me
3886425 3889136 I'll marry you, if you like
3891972 3894182 Come away with me
3897978 3901815 If you like,<br />I'll even stop being a bandit
3901940 3906236 I've got money hidden away,<br />you'll live comfortably
3906361 3910490 I could work hard,<br />even sell things in the street
3910615 3913952 I'll do anything to please you...
3915287 3919291 ...if you'll come away with me
3921460 3923753 Marry me
3928425 3931344 Please say yes
3933013 3935432 If you don't, I'll have to kill you
3939311 3944024 Don't cry.<br />Tell me you'll be my wife
3945150 3947152 Answer me!
3959331 3964044 But how could I answer?<br />How could I, a woman...
3966046 3968298 ...answer such a question?
3988568 3992322 I understand.<br />You mean that we men must decide
3995075 3996660 Wait! Wait!
3997536 4002082 I refuse to risk my life<br />for such a woman
4029442 4033238 You shameless whore!
4039035 4041079 Why don't you kill yourself?
4044249 4048169 If you want her, I'll give her to you
4050005 4054509 I regret losing my horse more<br />than I'll regret losing this woman
4110315 4111566 Wait!
4111691 4113151 Stay!
4126039 4130543 Save your tears. No matter how much<br />you cry, you won't fool anyone
4132379 4135298 Don't talk like that to her,<br />it's unmanly
4136591 4139427 Women can't help crying,<br />they're naturally weak
4166121 4168373 It's you two who are weak
4170792 4176673 If you are my husband, kill this man,<br />then you can tell me to kill myself
4176798 4180802 But you're not a real man.<br />That is why I was crying
4182387 4184806 I'm tired of this farce
4193189 4199529 I thought that Tajomaru<br />might find some way out
4201364 4206911 I thought that if he would save me,<br />I would do anything for him
4207537 4214294 I wanted you to take me away,<br />I would have been yours
4219883 4223636 But he's not a man, either.<br />He's just like my husband
4224888 4230727 Remember,<br />a woman loves a real man only
4230852 4234355 She can be won only<br />by the strength of your swords!
4574487 4576864 I don't want to die!
4744448 4746826 And that's supposed to be true?
4746951 4749954 I saw it with my own eyes
4750079 4754500 - I doubt it<br />- I don't tell lies
4754625 4756794 Liars always have an answer
4756919 4761674 But if men do not tell the truth,<br />trust each other, life is a hell
4761799 4765803 - Right. Our world is a hell<br />- No, I trust men
4767805 4770558 I don't want to believe<br />this world is a hell
4770683 4773269 Shouting will make no difference
4773394 4777398 Just think, now.<br />Which of these stories do you believe?
4777523 4779233 I just don't know
4780359 4782528 They make no sense
4782653 4786991 Then don't worry about it.<br />It's not as though men are reasonable
4849261 4851138 What are you doing?
4855059 4857103 What does it look like?
4859688 4861690 That's horrible
4862650 4867363 Why? If I don't take these baby clothes,<br />someone else will
4869031 4870908 You are evil
4871909 4874870 Me? Then what about<br />the baby's parents?
4874995 4881252 They enjoyed making the baby,<br />then they throw it away. That's real evil
4881377 4883379 No, you're wrong
4885047 4890803 See the amulet case<br />the parents left to guard over it
4891804 4894140 Think of their suffering
4894265 4897143 Well, if you're going<br />to sympathise with others...
4897268 4898644 Selfish
4898769 4903774 What's wrong with that?<br />That's the way we are, the way we live
4903899 4907778 You can't live unless<br />you're what you call selfish
4916245 4918080 Brute!
4919457 4925504 All men are selfish and dishonest.<br />They all have excuses...
4926797 4931469 ...the bandit...the husband...the wife...
4933804 4935431 ...and you!
4941979 4945524 You say you don't lie. That's funny
4946358 4949945 You may have fooled the police,<br />but not me
4967421 4970799 Well, where is that dagger?
4970925 4975638 The pearl-inlaid handle<br />the bandit said was valuable
4976680 4979391 Did the earth swallow it?
4982436 4984688 Or did someone steal it?
4988150 4990402 Am I right? So it seems
4993405 4997409 Now there is a really<br />selfish action for you
5011549 5016762 Anything else to tell me?<br />If not, I think I'll be going
5095299 5099094 Are you taking what little it has left?
5109021 5113108 I have six children of my own
5114943 5121867 One more won't make things<br />any more difficult
5129500 5135714 I'm sorry.<br />I'm ashamed of what I said
5139176 5146725 You can't afford not to be suspicious<br />of people nowadays
5151146 5153315 It's me who should be ashamed
5155401 5160114 I don't know why<br />I did a thing like that
5160239 5163033 No, I'm grateful to you
5176422 5180092 Because now, thanks to you...
5182136 5186473 ...I think I will be able<br />to keep my faith in mankind
5187433 5189268 I am unworthy
