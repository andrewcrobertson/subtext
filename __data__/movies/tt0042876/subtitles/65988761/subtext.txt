168232 172528 I don't understand.<br />I just don't understand.
217073 221160 I don't understand it at all.
222995 224747 I just don't understand.
246185 247687 What's wrong?
250898 252984 What don't you understand?
256362 259198 I've never heard<br />such a strange story.
259740 262159 Why don't you<br />tell me about it?
262994 267873 We happen to have<br />a wise priest in our midst.
269667 275631 No, not even the renowned,<br />wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple
276340 279719 has heard a story<br />as strange as this.
281053 284640 So you know something<br />about this strange story?
284724 290229 This man and I have just seen it<br />and heard it ourselves.
290313 292064 Where?
292565 294567 In the courthouse garden.
294650 296319 The courthouse?
297737 300156 A man was murdered.
300239 303909 Just one? So what?
304869 307663 On top of this gate,
308122 311876 you'll find at least<br />five or six unclaimed bodies.
312877 314628 You're right.
315004 320301 War, earthquake, winds,
321093 325181 fire, famine, the plague...
325765 329268 Year after year,<br />it's been nothing but disasters.
333606 338944 And bandits descend upon us<br />every night.
340321 343866 I've seen so many men
343949 348204 getting killed like insects,
349455 355086 but even I have never heard<br />a story as horrible as this.
361759 365346 Yes. So horrible.
369266 371477 This time,
372311 375773 I may finally lose<br />my faith in the human soul.
376315 382321 It's worse than bandits,<br />the plague,
383197 387952 famine, fire, or war.
388494 390830 Look here, priest.
391414 393582 Enough with the sermon.
393666 398212 It sounded interesting,<br />at least while I kept out of the rain.
398504 403050 But if it's a sermon,<br />I'd sooner listen to the rain.
434331 437042 Hear me out.
437293 439837 Maybe you can tell me<br />what it means.
439920 444300 I don't understand<br />any of those three.
444383 447219 - Which three?<br />- Well -
447928 450473 I'll tell you about them.
450556 453559 Calm down<br />and tell me slowly.
454477 457396 The rain's not going to stop<br />any time soon.
458481 460983 RASHOMON
477583 479585 It was three days ago.
480169 484215 I went into the mountains<br />to get wood.
706228 708856 I ran as fast as I could<br />to tell the police.
710023 714862 Then, three days later - today,<br />I was called to testily
716572 719408 Yes, that's right.
723287 729001 I was the one<br />who first found the body.
729251 732504 What?<br />Did I see a sword or something?
732588 735424 No, nothing at all.
737509 741013 Just a woman's hat<br />caught on a branch,
741680 745350 and the cap of a samurai<br />that had been trampled on.
745934 750314 There was a cut-up piece of rope<br />near the body,
751356 754943 and further along in the leaves,
755027 758614 a shiny amulet case<br />with red lining.
758697 760365 Yes.
761700 767039 That was all I found, yes.
768957 770584 Yes.
772252 777424 I met the murdered man<br />before his death.
778342 784306 It was three days ago,<br />in the afternoon.
785974 790229 On the road from Sekiyama<br />to Yamashina.
808163 812417 The woman had a veil,
813085 815254 so I couldn't see her face.
815879 820342 The man was armed<br />with a sword,
820425 823095 as well as a bow and arrows.
826431 828559 Little did I expect
829184 834147 that he would meet such a fate.
835941 839695 A human life is truly as frail
839778 843073 and fleeting<br />as the morning dew.
845117 848954 What a shame<br />that his should end this way.
849705 852291 I'm sorry.
855961 860632 This man I caught is Tajomaru.
861466 866763 Yes, the notorious bandit<br />everyone speaks of.
869057 874062 The last time I almost caught him,<br />he looked the same
874146 876648 and he carried that same sword.
878859 883322 It was two days ago at dusk,<br />by the banks of the Katsura...
900714 903717 What's wrong?
915187 919274 There were 17 arrows<br />with eagle feathers,
919983 923987 a leather bow, and a horse.
924863 928700 All these belonged<br />to the dead man, yes.
930827 936458 The irony of Tajomaru being<br />thrown off his stolen horse,
936541 939544 this had to be fateful retribution.
947260 949721 I fell off the horse?
950847 952557 You fool!
956103 957729 On that day...
966446 970075 I was riding that horse<br />and I was suddenly very thirsty.
970742 973036 So around Osaka,<br />I drank from a spring.
986049 989177 There must have been<br />a dead poisonous snake upstream.
989261 993098 After a while, I got<br />an incredible stomachache.
993390 998520 By the time I came to the river,<br />I couldn't hold it any longer.
999271 1003316 So I got off the horse<br />and crouched in the field.
1008030 1010365 I fell off?
1011366 1014453 Obviously, a fool can think<br />only foolish thoughts.
1017247 1021209 I know sooner or later<br />you'll have my neck,
1021626 1023962 so I'm not going to<br />hide anything.
1026757 1029968 It was this Tajomaru<br />who killed that man.
1032637 1036725 I saw that couple three days ago.<br />It was a hot afternoon.
1037267 1041396 Suddenly a cool breeze<br />rustled the leaves.
1042189 1047069 If it hadn't been for that wind,<br />I wouldn't have killed him.
1200931 1205685 I caught a glimpse<br />and then she was gone.
1206144 1208563 Maybe that's why.
1208897 1212025 I thought I saw a goddess.
1212108 1214569 At that moment<br />I decided to capture her,
1214653 1216821 even if I had to kill her man.
1219366 1224913 But if I could have her<br />without killing, all the better.
1224996 1230794 My intention then was to take her<br />without killing the man.
1232462 1236132 But I couldn't do it<br />on that road to Yamashina.
1253108 1254776 What do you want?
1267497 1268999 What do you want?
1280218 1281720 What is it?
1302240 1303908 Don't be suspicious.
1307495 1310206 See? Isn't this nice?
1312876 1315003 Take a good look at it.
1320842 1325680 There are some ruins over there.
1326264 1328558 When I dug up the mound,
1328641 1332854 I found a heap of<br />swords and mirrors.
1332937 1335565 I buried them in a grove<br />behind the mountain
1335648 1337984 so no one else would find them.
1338777 1341780 If you're interested,<br />I'll sell them to you cheap.
1437500 1439377 It's over there.
1441838 1443673 Walk ahead of me.
1487759 1491262 It's here.<br />Beyond those pines.
1605376 1609380 Your husband has taken sick.
1617388 1620558 Her face turned pale.
1620642 1624687 She stared at me<br />with frozen eyes,
1624771 1629067 her expression<br />intense like a child's.
1629776 1631361 When I saw that,
1631444 1634989 I envied the man<br />and I suddenly hated him.
1635073 1639619 I wanted to show her how pathetic<br />he looked tied to that pine tree.
1639702 1644332 These thoughts that weren't there<br />before filled my head.
1738176 1741929 I had never seen<br />such fierceness in a woman.
1884614 1889702 And so I had succeeded in having her<br />without killing her husband.
1893831 1899045 I still had no intention<br />of killing him.
1900421 1902006 But then...
1903883 1905384 Wait!
1907011 1908596 Stop!
1909680 1914644 Either you die<br />or my husband dies.
1915144 1917229 One of you must die.
1927782 1933454 To have my shame known<br />to two men is worse than dying.
1936374 1940461 I will go
1940544 1944840 with the survivor.
2119932 2123269 So I had to kill him,<br />but I wanted to do it honorably.
2123352 2125938 He fought very well.
2126272 2128941 We crossed swords 23 times.
2129275 2134238 I remember this<br />because I'm still impressed.
2134613 2138242 No one had ever crossed swords<br />with me more than 20 times.
2142663 2145916 What? The woman?
2147585 2149336 I don't know.
2150004 2154550 When the man died,<br />I turned to her.
2154925 2157011 She was gone.
2157553 2162641 The fighting must have scared her<br />and she ran away.
2163017 2166228 I ran out to the mountain road.
2166312 2169523 All I found was her horse<br />grazing calmly.
2170357 2174028 I was attracted<br />to her fierce spirit,
2175070 2178490 but, after all,<br />she was just like other women.
2178866 2181452 I didn't even look for her.
2183996 2187374 What? His sword?
2188500 2191754 I exchanged it in town for liquor.
2192922 2196050 What? Her dagger?
2198844 2204808 It had pearl inlay.<br />Looked very valuable.
2205517 2208187 I totally forgot about it.
2209104 2211357 That was foolish.
2211440 2213734 The biggest mistake<br />I ever made!
2235756 2237883 Even amongst the bandits,
2237967 2242388 Tajomaru is famous<br />for being a womanizer.
2243097 2248060 Why, last fall,<br />a young wife went to the temple
2248143 2252940 and she and her maid were<br />found dead in the mountains.
2253023 2255192 That must have been him too.
2261282 2266412 Who knows what really happened<br />to that woman who left her horse?
2267204 2269039 Well,
2271917 2275754 that woman showed up<br />at the courthouse.
2278590 2284555 She was hiding in the temple<br />when the police found her.
2284805 2286307 It's a lie.
2287349 2291603 It's all a lie.<br />Tajomaru's story and the woman's.
2292229 2294940 It's human to lie.
2298777 2302197 Most of the time we can't even<br />be honest with ourselves.
2302281 2304241 That may be.
2309913 2314710 But it's because men are weak<br />that they lie,
2314793 2318756 even to themselves.
2318839 2320507 Not another sermon.
2321759 2326930 I don't care if it's a lie,<br />as long as it's entertaining.
2329058 2331268 What story did the woman<br />come up with?
2332686 2338233 Well, it's completely different<br />from Tajomaru's story.
2339860 2341820 So different
2341904 2347868 that her face didn't even<br />show the fierceness he spoke of.
2354666 2358295 She was so docile,<br />she was almost pitiful.
2386532 2389410 That man in the blue kimono,
2391995 2394665 after forcing me to yield to him,
2396166 2401922 proudly announced that<br />he was the infamous Tajomaru,
2405050 2409930 and laughed mockingly<br />at my husband who was tied up.
2420023 2421942 How horrified
2424570 2428198 my husband must have been.
2431743 2434913 The more he struggled,
2437499 2444465 the tighter the ropes dug in.
2447718 2450554 I ran to his side.
2450929 2454766 Or rather, I tried to.
2562791 2564710 Even now,
2566837 2569339 when I think of his eyes,
2570215 2574386 my blood turns cold in my veins.
2577889 2582603 What I saw in them was<br />neither anger,
2583854 2587816 nor sorrow,
2590027 2595991 but a cold light,<br />a look of loathing.
2603540 2605208 Don't.
2605834 2608211 Don't look at me like that.
2613258 2614926 It's too cruel.
2616219 2618472 Beat me,
2619389 2621642 kill me,
2621725 2626647 but don't look at me like that.<br />Please, stop.
2710772 2713024 Now kill me.
2714484 2716695 Kill me at once.
2750687 2752272 Stop.
2753523 2754775 Don't.
2760739 2762365 Please don't.
2806409 2813333 I must have fainted after that.
2821550 2824302 When I came to<br />and looked around...
2832602 2835272 Imagine my shock.
2848785 2854749 I saw my dagger
2856293 2861172 in my dead husband's chest.
2874936 2879190 I was in shock
2881693 2885196 and I don't remember<br />how I left the woods.
2890785 2893413 But when I came to,
2896708 2902672 I was standing by the pond<br />at the foot of the hill.
2909763 2912599 I threw myself into the pond.
2914351 2918021 I tried many different things.
2920065 2924945 But I failed to kill myself.
2936873 2941378 What should a poor,
2943463 2948885 helpless woman like me do?
2983712 2987549 I see. The more I hear,<br />the more confused I get.
2989759 2993513 But women use their tears<br />to fool everyone.
2993596 2996099 They even fool themselves.
2996933 3000895 So you have to beware<br />of the woman's story.
3002564 3005650 When you hear<br />the dead man's story -
3005734 3007777 He's dead.
3008778 3011573 How can he tell his story?
3011656 3014367 He spoke through a medium.
3015702 3017454 Lies.
3018163 3020331 His story was also lies.
3022125 3026796 But dead men don't lie.
3027464 3029340 Why is that?
3031134 3034387 I refuse to believe<br />that man would be so sinful.
3035764 3038183 Suit yourself.
3038266 3041144 But is there anyone who's<br />really good?
3041227 3043980 Maybe goodness is<br />just make-believe.
3044064 3045899 What a frightening -
3046858 3050278 Man just wants to forget<br />the bad stuff
3050361 3052655 and believe in the<br />made-up good stuff.
3052739 3056076 It's easier that way.<br />- Ridiculous.
3059496 3064334 Never mind.<br />Let's hear the dead man's story.
3111381 3114551 I am in darkness now.
3114968 3119931 I am suffering in the dark.
3120223 3125103 Cursed be those who cast me<br />into this dark hell.
3163099 3168021 After the bandit<br />attacked my wife,
3168104 3170690 he tried to console her.
3172275 3177447 She sat on the leaves,<br />staring down at her knees.
3178281 3181659 The bandit was cunning.
3182160 3184370 Now that her virtue was stained,
3184454 3187290 she could no longer be<br />with her husband
3187373 3191336 Leave the husband<br />and why not marry him instead?
3191419 3195882 He said he only attacked her<br />out of his love for her.
3196507 3199052 When she heard that,
3199135 3202472 my wife raised her face<br />as if in a trance.
3208061 3213775 She had never looked so beautiful.
3220323 3226287 And what was my beautiful wife's<br />response to the bandit
3226371 3230583 in front of her helpless husband?
3234003 3235713 Wherever.
3238341 3240927 Take me wherever you want.
3242929 3245139 That's what she said.
3248309 3251604 But that wasn't her only sin
3251688 3256317 or I wouldn't be suffering<br />in the dark like this.
3271374 3273376 Please kill him.
3273459 3276671 While he's alive,<br />I cannot go with you.
3277338 3279257 Kill him!
3280466 3284304 Those words were<br />like a wind that
3284387 3288516 threatened to blow me<br />into the depths of darkness.
3293563 3301112 Has such a hateful thing<br />ever been uttered by a human before?
3301612 3305700 Even the bandit turned pale<br />at those words.
3307285 3312206 Please kill him.
3347450 3350995 What do you want me<br />to do with her?
3351829 3357418 Kill her or save her?<br />You only have to nod.
3360963 3364008 For these words alone,
3364092 3367553 I was ready to pardon his crime.
3371808 3375812 Kill her or let her go?
3404382 3407844 I don't know<br />how many hours passed.
3450428 3452263 She got away.
3452805 3455516 Now I'll have to worry about<br />my own fate.
3480583 3482585 Everything was silent.
3484170 3487381 I heard someone crying.
3488549 3491135 Someone is crying.
3492094 3494847 Who is that?
3640159 3642244 Everything was silent.
3644163 3646624 How quiet it was.
3648376 3651379 Suddenly the sun went away.
3653005 3657468 I was enveloped in deep silence.
3659595 3664684 I lay there in the stillness.
3667228 3672608 Then someone<br />quietly approached me.
3673651 3679448 That someone<br />gently withdrew the dagger
3681075 3684495 from my heart.
3713399 3714984 It's not true!
3715067 3719822 There was no dagger.<br />He was killed by a sword.
3757735 3760488 Now it's getting interesting.
3760571 3765868 It seems you saw the whole thing.
3770039 3772917 So why didn't you tell the court?
3774043 3776462 I didn't want to get involved.
3776545 3779048 You can talk about it here, right?
3780090 3781759 Tell me, then.
3781842 3784970 Your story seems to be<br />the most interesting.
3785054 3789892 I don't want to hear it.<br />No more horror stories.
3790601 3793229 They are common stories<br />these days.
3793312 3795189 I even heard that
3795272 3799777 the demon living here in Rashomon<br />fled in fear of the ferocity of man.
3803405 3807827 Come on.<br />How much do you know?
3812748 3816544 I found the woman's hat<br />in the mountains.
3816627 3818420 You already said that.
3820923 3826387 About 20 yards further,<br />I heard a woman crying.
3826971 3829473 From behind a bush,
3829974 3834562 I saw a man tied up,<br />a woman crying and Tajomaru.
3836313 3840860 So you lied when you said<br />you found the body.
3840943 3844029 I didn't want to get involved.
3845948 3848450 All right, then. Go on.
3848993 3851620 What was Tajomaru doing?
3854665 3859545 He was down on his knees,<br />begging the woman for forgiveness.
3862506 3867386 Until now, whenever I wanted<br />to do something bad, I did it.
3867469 3870306 That way I suffered less.
3871140 3873309 But today, it's different.
3873767 3877897 I already had you,<br />but I only want you more.
3877980 3880024 It's very hard.
3880107 3883110 I beg you to be my wife.
3886989 3890034 The notorious bandit Tajomaru
3892578 3895331 is begging you<br />on his hands and knees.
3898584 3902546 If you wish,<br />I'll even stop being a bandit.
3902630 3906800 I have enough stashed away<br />to give you a lavish life.
3906884 3911055 And if you don't want my dirty money,<br />I'll even work.
3911555 3915392 I'll stoop to selling odds and ends<br />on the street to support you.
3916060 3920898 I'll do anything<br />if you come with me.
3921982 3924860 Marry me, please.
3926946 3932034 If you say no,<br />I have no choice but to kill you.
3933577 3936038 Please, say yes.
3939917 3943128 Stop crying and answer me.
3943212 3945297 Tell me you'll be my wife!
3945714 3947716 Say it!
3960020 3962022 It's impossible.
3963399 3969154 How could I, a woman,<br />say anything?
3989091 3992928 I get it. You mean<br />it's up to us men to decide.
3995556 3997349 Hold it!
3998100 4002771 I refuse to risk my life<br />for such a woman.
4030132 4034344 You've been with two men.<br />Why don't you kill yourself?
4039683 4041810 Hopeless.
4044855 4049109 I don't want this shameless whore.<br />You can have her.
4050444 4055074 At this stage, I'd rather lose her<br />instead of the horse.
4110796 4112339 Wait!
4112422 4114049 Don't follow me!
4126687 4131066 Stop crying.<br />It's not going to work anymore.
4132943 4136155 Stop it. Don't bully her.
4137197 4140284 Women are weak by nature.
4166768 4168729 It's you who are weak.
4171398 4177362 If you are my husband,<br />why don't you kill this man?
4177863 4181658 Then you can tell me to kill myself.<br />That's a real man.
4182868 4185621 You're not a real man either.
4193795 4197799 When I heard you were Tajomaru,<br />I stopped crying.
4197883 4200886 I was sick of this<br />tiresome daily farce.
4201887 4207601 I thought, "Tajomaru might<br />get me out of this."
4208101 4213732 "If he'd only save me,<br />I'd do anything for him."
4213815 4215817 I thought to myself.
4220447 4224159 But you were just as petty<br />as my husband.
4225452 4226912 Just remember:
4226995 4230999 A woman loves a man<br />who loves passionately.
4231500 4235003 A man has to make a woman his<br />by his sword.
4575010 4577596 I don't want to die!
4744929 4747640 So that's the real story.
4747724 4750602 I don't tell lies.<br />I saw it with my own eyes.
4750685 4752562 I doubt it.
4752645 4755064 It's true. I don't lie.
4755148 4757567 No one lies after he says<br />he's going to do so.
4757650 4759486 It's horrifying.
4759569 4762655 If men don't trust each other,<br />this earth might as well be hell.
4762739 4764282 That's right.<br />This world is hell.
4764365 4766701 No, I believe in men.
4768244 4770747 I don't want this place to be hell.
4771456 4773875 Shouting doesn't help.
4773958 4778129 Think about it. Out of these three,<br />whose story is believable?
4778213 4782091 No idea.
4783301 4788014 In the end, you cannot<br />understand the things men do.
4849868 4851452 What are you doing?
4855665 4857625 What's it to you?
4860295 4863172 - That's terrible!<br />- Terrible?
4863256 4866342 Someone else would have<br />taken the kimono.
4866426 4868636 Why shouldn't I?
4869387 4871931 - It's evil.<br />- Evil?
4872348 4875059 What about this kid's parents?
4875560 4880106 They had their fun<br />and then they throw out the kid?
4880189 4881983 They're evil.
4882066 4884444 No, you're wrong.
4885570 4888990 Look at the amulet<br />on the kimono.
4889073 4892076 It was left to protect the baby.
4892160 4894746 Think about what they went through<br />to abandon this baby.
4894829 4897749 I don't have time to mind<br />everyone's feelings.
4897832 4901336 - You selfish -<br />- What's wrong with that?
4901419 4904589 Dogs are better off in this world.
4904672 4907842 If you're not selfish,<br />you can't survive.
4916684 4918895 Damn it.
4919854 4923524 Everyone is selfish<br />and dishonest.
4923608 4926611 Making excuses.
4927236 4932533 The bandit,<br />the woman, the man
4934285 4935954 and you!
4942418 4946422 And you aren't?<br />That's funny.
4946839 4951803 You may have fooled the court,<br />but not me.
4968069 4971030 So what did you do<br />with the dagger?
4971531 4973992 The valuable one<br />with the pearl inlay
4974075 4976744 that Tajomaru was talking about?
4977245 4980248 What happened to it?<br />Did it disappear in the grass?
4981249 4985586 If you didn't, who stole it?
4988756 4990883 It seems I'm right.
4993928 4998266 A bandit calling another a bandit.<br />Now that's selfish.
5012155 5015616 Do you have<br />anything else to say?
5016367 5018369 If not, I'll be going.
5095905 5099784 What are you doing?<br />Taking what little it has left?
5109710 5114215 I have six kids of my own.
5115383 5122640 Another one<br />wouldn't make a difference.
5129939 5136529 I am ashamed of what I said.
5139740 5141576 It's inevitable
5141993 5147707 to be suspicious of others<br />on a day like this.
5151627 5154130 I'm the one<br />who should be ashamed.
5155923 5160595 I don't understand my own soul.
5160678 5163973 No, I'm grateful to you.
5176944 5180948 Thanks to you,
5182700 5187038 I think I can keep<br />my faith in man.
5187872 5189540 Don't mention it.
5286512 5291100 THE END
