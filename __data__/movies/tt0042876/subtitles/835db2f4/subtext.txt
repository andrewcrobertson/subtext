168000 171928 I don't understand.<br />I just don't understand.
216899 220411 I don't understand it at all.
222807 224347 I just don't understand.
245906 246782 What's wrong?
250619 251996 What don't you understand?
256084 258628 I've never heard<br />such a strange story.
259420 260880 Why don't you tell me about it?
262716 267221 We happen to have<br />a wise priest in our midst.
269473 275146 No, not even the renowned,<br />wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple
276147 279109 has heard a story<br />as strange as this.
280777 283823 So you know something<br />about this strange story?
284448 289745 This man and I have just seen it<br />and heard it ourselves.
290037 290913 Where?
292290 293917 In the courthouse garden.
294292 295377 The courthouse?
297504 299631 A man was murdered.
300007 303052 Just one? So what?
304595 307056 On top of this gate,
307849 311477 you'll find at least<br />five or six unclaimed bodies.
312646 313772 You're right.
314732 319862 War, earthquake, winds,
320738 324325 fire, famine, the plague...
325452 328413 Year after year,<br />it's been nothing but disasters.
333502 338424 And bandits descend upon us<br />every night.
339967 343346 I've seen so many men
343513 347601 getting killed like insects,
349102 354692 but even I have never heard<br />a story as horrible as this.
361449 364828 Yes. So horrible.
368957 370459 This time,
372002 374798 I may finally lose<br />my faith in the human soul.
376090 381846 It's worse than bandits,<br />the plague,
382890 387186 famine, fire, or war.
388229 389438 Look here, priest.
391148 392525 Enough with the sermon.
393360 397447 It sounded interesting,<br />at least while I kept out of the rain.
398240 402369 But if it's a sermon,<br />I'd sooner listen to the rain.
434029 436365 Hear me out.
437074 439034 Maybe you can tell me<br />what it means.
439660 443790 I don't understand<br />any of those three.
444124 446418 - Which three?<br />- Well...
447711 450088 I'll tell you about them.
450255 452841 Calm down and tell me slowly.
454218 456637 The rain's not going to stop<br />any time soon.
458222 461559 <i>RASHOMON</i>
477368 478536 It was three days ago.
479913 483833 I went into the mountains<br />to get wood.
705910 708664 <i>I ran as fast as I could<br />to tell the police.</i>
709707 714253 <i>Then, three days later, today,<br />I was called to testify.</i>
716255 718842 Yes, that's right.
722971 728519 I was the one<br />who first found the body.
728895 732064 What? Did I see a sword<br />or something?
732231 734901 No, nothing at all.
737195 740324 Just a woman's hat<br />caught on a branch,
741366 744578 and the cap of a samurai<br />that had been trampled on.
745537 749626 There was a cut-up piece of rope<br />near the body,
751002 754506 and further along in the leaves,
754672 757927 a shiny amulet case<br />with red lining.
758344 759136 Yes.
761347 767061 That was all I found, yes.
768647 769356 Yes.
771983 776905 I met the murdered man<br />before his death.
777989 782620 It was three days ago,<br />in the afternoon.
783412 789878 On the road from Sekiyama<br />to Yamashina.
807814 810192 <i>The woman had a veil,</i>
810359 814488 <i>so I couldn't see her face.</i>
815531 819661 <i>The man was armed with a sword,</i>
820078 822247 <i>as well as a bow and arrows.</i>
826209 827502 Little did I expect
828837 833426 that he would meet such a fate.
835636 839224 A human life is truly as frail
839391 842352 and fleeting as the morning dew.
844896 848233 What a shame that<br />his should end this way.
849444 851613 I'm sorry.
855700 860331 This man I caught is Tajomaru.
861332 866420 Yes, the notorious bandit<br />everyone speaks of.
868797 873762 The last time I almost caught him,<br />he looked the same
873928 876264 and he carried that same sword.
878642 883022 It was three days ago at dusk,<br />by the banks of the Katsura...
899916 903670 What's wrong?
914973 918936 <i>There were 17 arrows<br />with eagle feathers,</i>
919770 923650 <i>a leather bow, and a horse.</i>
924651 928655 All these belonged<br />to the dead man, yes.
930574 936163 The irony of Tajomaru being<br />thrown off his stolen horse,
936330 939041 this had to be fateful retribution.
947050 949136 I fell off the horse?
950596 951597 You fool!
955893 957145 On that day...
966405 969450 I was riding that horse<br />and I was suddenly very thirsty.
970451 972704 So around Osaka,<br />I drank from a spring.
985760 988762 There must have been<br />a dead poisonous snake upstream.
989054 992517 After a while, I got<br />an incredible stomachache.
993101 998106 By the time I came to the river,<br />I couldn't hold it any longer.
999065 1002778 So I got off the horse<br />and crouched on the bank.
1007825 1009952 I fell off?
1011120 1013874 Obviously, a fool can think<br />only foolish thoughts.
1017002 1020631 I know sooner or later<br />you'll have my neck,
1021381 1023051 so I'm not going to<br />hide anything.
1026554 1029349 It was this Tajomaru<br />who killed that man.
1032478 1036190 I saw that couple three days ago.<br />It was a hot afternoon.
1037066 1040903 Suddenly a cool breeze<br />rustled the leaves.
1041905 1046660 If it hadn't been for that wind,<br />I wouldn't have killed him.
1200704 1205209 I caught a glimpse<br />and then she was gone.
1205918 1207920 Maybe that's why.
1208754 1211382 I thought I saw a goddess.
1211966 1214177 At that moment<br />I decided to capture her,
1214344 1215971 even if I had to kill her man.
1219099 1224439 But if I could have her<br />without killing, all the better.
1224772 1230236 My intention then was to take her<br />without killing the man.
1232280 1235534 But I couldn't do it<br />on that road to Yamashina.
1252927 1253762 What do you want?
1267611 1268528 What do you want?
1279999 1280875 What is it?
1302065 1303274 Don't be suspicious.
1307321 1309573 See? Isn't this nice?
1312660 1314203 Take a good look at it.
1321586 1325257 There are some ruins over there.
1326092 1327593 When I dug up the mound,
1327927 1332181 I found a heap of<br />swords and mirrors.
1332723 1335101 I buried them in a grove<br />behind the mountain
1335268 1336854 so no one else would find them.
1338605 1341483 If you're interested,<br />I'll sell them to you cheap.
1437129 1438632 It's over there.
1441635 1442552 Walk ahead of me.
1487768 1490731 It's here.<br />Beyond those pines.
1605148 1609110 Your husband<br />has been bitten by a snake!
1617161 1620039 Her face turned pale.
1620206 1623877 She stared at me<br />with frozen eyes,
1624460 1628214 her expression<br />intense like a child's.
1629591 1630885 When I saw that,
1631135 1634138 I envied the man<br />and I suddenly hated him.
1634847 1639018 I wanted her to see how pathetic<br />he looked tied up among those pines.
1639351 1644024 These thoughts that weren't there<br />before filled my head.
1738085 1741589 <i>I had never seen<br />such fierceness in a woman.</i>
1884455 1889334 And so I had succeeded in having her<br />without killing her husband.
1893715 1898553 I still had no intention<br />of killing him.
1900346 1901264 But then...
1903726 1904602 Wait!
1906937 1907813 Stop!
1909565 1914362 Either you die<br />or my husband dies.
1915071 1916615 One of you must die.
1927627 1933007 To have my shame known<br />to two men is worse than dying.
1936220 1939097 I will go
1939807 1944771 with the survivor.
2119838 2122882 So I had to kill him,<br />but I wanted to do it honorably.
2123091 2125093 He fought very well.
2126177 2127972 We crossed swords 23 times.
2129098 2133728 I remember this<br />because I'm still impressed.
2134603 2137983 No one had ever crossed swords<br />with me more than 20 times.
2142654 2145449 What? The woman?
2147493 2148286 I don't know.
2149954 2153958 When the man died,<br />I turned back to her.
2154959 2156252 She was gone.
2157588 2162176 The fighting must have scared her<br />and she ran away.
2162926 2165846 I ran out to the mountain road.
2166263 2168892 All I found was her horse<br />grazing calmly.
2170351 2173480 I was attracted<br />to her fierce spirit,
2174981 2177735 but, after all,<br />she was just like other women.
2178903 2180738 I didn't even look for her.
2184033 2186786 What? His sword?
2188538 2191166 I exchanged it in town for liquor.
2192834 2195670 What? Her dagger?
2198174 2204680 It had pearl inlay.<br />Looked very valuable.
2205431 2207725 I totally forgot about it.
2209019 2210729 That was foolish.
2211396 2213315 The biggest mistake I ever made!
2235631 2237466 Even amongst the bandits,
2237925 2241805 Tajomaru is famous<br />for being a womanizer.
2243098 2247811 Why, last fall,<br />a young wife went to the temple
2248061 2252733 and she and her maid were<br />found dead in the mountains.
2252900 2254277 That must have been him too.
2261243 2265747 Who knows what really happened<br />to that woman who left her horse?
2267166 2268250 Well,
2271796 2275216 that woman showed up<br />at the courthouse.
2278511 2284310 She was hiding in the temple<br />when the police found her.
2284852 2285644 It's a lie.
2287313 2291193 It's all a lie.<br />Tajomaru's story and the woman's.
2292193 2294446 It's human to lie.
2298783 2301996 Most of the time we can't even<br />be honest with ourselves.
2302163 2303789 That may be.
2309922 2313550 But it's because men are weak<br />that they lie,
2314676 2318555 even to themselves.
2318722 2320308 Not another sermon.
2321684 2326522 I don't care if it's a lie,<br />as long as it's entertaining.
2329108 2331111 What story did the woman<br />come up with?
2332613 2337576 Well, it's completely different<br />from Tajomaru's story.
2339829 2340830 So different
2341706 2347587 that her face didn't even<br />show the fierceness he spoke of.
2354637 2357473 She was so docile,<br />she was almost pitiful.
2386463 2388674 That man in the blue kimono,
2391928 2394055 after forcing me to yield to him,
2396057 2401939 proudly announced that<br />he was the infamous Tajomaru,
2404817 2409488 and laughed mockingly<br />at my husband who was tied up.
2420167 2420960 How humiliated
2424505 2427633 my husband must have been.
2431597 2434516 The more he struggled,
2437394 2444569 the tighter the ropes dug in.
2447655 2450158 I ran to his side.
2450867 2454455 Or rather, I tried to.
2562699 2563783 Even now,
2566703 2568580 when I think of his eyes,
2570123 2574128 my blood turns cold in my veins.
2577840 2582513 What I saw in them was<br />neither anger,
2583765 2587520 nor sorrow,
2589899 2595823 but a cold light,<br />a look of loathing.
2603459 2604378 Don't.
2605879 2607799 Don't look at me like that.
2613181 2614308 It's too cruel.
2616185 2617479 Beat me,
2617813 2620858 kill me,
2621693 2626074 but don't look at me like that.<br />Please, stop.
2710692 2712570 Now kill me.
2714406 2716367 Kill me at once.
2750665 2751666 Stop.
2753669 2754670 Don't.
2760763 2761847 Please don't.
2806535 2813294 I must have fainted after that.
2821556 2823600 When I came to<br />and looked around...
2832530 2834739 Imagine my shock.
2848794 2849837 In my husband's...
2852339 2854632 In my dead husband's chest
2856384 2860805 I saw the cold glitter of my dagger!
2874942 2878821 I was in shock
2881699 2884493 and I don't remember<br />how I left the woods.
2890832 2893084 But the next thing I knew,
2896754 2902509 I was standing by the pond<br />at the foot of the hill.
2909766 2912143 I threw myself into the pond.
2914270 2917898 I tried many different things.
2920067 2924488 But I failed to kill myself.
2936832 2941002 What should a poor,
2943421 2948592 helpless woman like me do?
2982748 2987044 I see. The more I hear,<br />the more confused I get.
2989796 2993008 But women use their tears<br />to fool everyone.
2993591 2995427 They even fool themselves.
2996970 3000472 So you have to beware<br />of the woman's story.
3002599 3005310 When you hear<br />the dead man's story...
3005686 3007312 He's dead.
3008772 3011107 How can he tell his story?
3011691 3013651 He spoke through a medium.
3015653 3016487 Lies.
3018197 3019657 His story was also lies.
3022159 3026705 But dead men don't lie.
3027497 3028915 Why is that?
3031208 3034295 I refuse to believe<br />that man would be so sinful.
3035838 3037631 Suit yourself.
3038299 3040384 But is there anyone who's<br />really good?
3041259 3043803 Maybe goodness is<br />just make-believe.
3044095 3045388 What a frightening...
3046890 3049809 Man just wants to forget<br />the bad stuff
3050393 3052519 and believe in the<br />made-up good stuff.
3052686 3055689 - It's easier that way.<br />- Ridiculous.
3059485 3064155 Never mind.<br />Let's hear the dead man's story.
3111365 3114116 I am in darkness now.
3114909 3119664 I am suffering in the dark.
3120206 3125293 Cursed be those who cast me<br />into this dark hell.
3163120 3167874 After the bandit<br />attacked my wife,
3168040 3170585 he tried to console her.
3172295 3177215 <i>She sat on the leaves,<br />staring down at her knees.</i>
3178341 3181219 <i>The bandit was cunning.</i>
3182137 3184180 <i>Now that her virtue was stained,</i>
3184347 3186683 <i>she could no longer be<br />with her husband.</i>
3186932 3190978 <i>Leave the husband<br />and why not marry him instead?</i>
3191395 3195399 <i>He said he only attacked her<br />out of his love for her.</i>
3196567 3198735 <i>When she heard that,</i>
3199152 3201654 <i>my wife raised her face<br />as if in a trance.</i>
3208076 3213665 She had never looked so beautiful.
3220254 3227220 <i>And what was my beautiful wife's<br />response to the bandit</i>
3228595 3230472 <i>in front of her helpless husband?</i>
3234059 3235268 Wherever.
3238355 3240397 Take me wherever you want.
3242900 3245027 That's what she said.
3248280 3251407 But that wasn't her only sin
3251783 3256204 or I wouldn't be suffering<br />in the dark like this.
3271300 3272843 Please kill him.
3273469 3276180 While he's alive,<br />I cannot go with you.
3277306 3278933 Kill him!
3280643 3284980 Those words were<br />like a wind that
3285146 3287941 threatened to blow me<br />into the depths of darkness.
3293529 3301120 Has such a hateful thing ever<br />been uttered by a human before?
3301619 3305581 Even the bandit turned pale<br />at those words.
3307333 3312170 Please kill him.
3347453 3350497 What do you want me<br />to do with her?
3351832 3357045 Kill her or save her?<br />You only have to nod.
3360965 3363217 <i>For these words alone,</i>
3364092 3367345 <i>I was ready to pardon his crime.</i>
3371808 3375603 Kill her or let her go?
3404380 3407381 <i>I don't know<br />how many hours passed.</i>
3450504 3451547 She got away.
3452840 3454299 Now I'll have to worry about<br />my own fate.
3480448 3481157 <i>Everything was silent.</i>
3484201 3487037 <i>I heard someone crying.</i>
3488539 3490456 <i>Someone is crying.</i>
3492208 3494377 <i>Who is that?</i>
3640050 3641468 Everything was silent.
3644054 3646097 How quiet it was.
3648349 3650727 Suddenly the sun went away.
3653062 3656982 I was enveloped in deep silence.
3659568 3664489 I lay there in the stillness.
3667158 3672455 Then someone<br />quietly approached me.
3673622 3679127 That someone<br />gently withdrew the dagger
3680962 3684174 from my heart.
3713367 3714326 It's not true!
3715035 3719372 There was no dagger.<br />He was killed by a sword.
3757698 3759825 Now it's getting interesting.
3760534 3765414 It seems you saw the whole thing.
3770085 3772420 So why didn't you tell the court?
3773963 3776132 I didn't want to get involved.
3776549 3778384 You can talk about it here, right?
3780010 3782262 Tell me, then.
3782929 3784848 Your story seems to be<br />the most interesting.
3785140 3789394 I don't want to hear it.<br />No more horror stories.
3790520 3792855 They are common stories<br />these days.
3793230 3795023 I even heard that
3795232 3798485 the demon living here in Rashomon<br />fled in fear of the ferocity of man.
3803322 3807285 Come on.<br />How much do you know?
3812748 3816334 I found the woman's hat<br />in the mountains.
3816585 3817794 You already said that.
3820922 3825801 About 20 yards farther,<br />I heard a woman crying.
3826886 3828929 From behind a bush,
3829847 3834184 I saw a man tied up,<br />a woman crying and Tajomaru.
3836311 3840607 So you lied when you said<br />you found the body.
3840773 3842817 I didn't want to get involved.
3845861 3847988 All right, then. Go on.
3848906 3850741 What was Tajomaru doing?
3854660 3859373 He was down on his knees,<br />begging the woman for forgiveness.
3862460 3866880 Until now, whenever I wanted<br />to do something bad, I did it.
3867422 3869674 That way I suffered less.
3871009 3872719 But today, it's different.
3873637 3877431 I already had you,<br />but I only want you more.
3877890 3879558 It's very hard.
3879975 3882478 I beg you to be my wife.
3886856 3889609 The notorious bandit Tajomaru
3892570 3894113 is begging you<br />on his hands and knees.
3898408 3902037 If you wish,<br />I'll even stop being a bandit.
3902496 3905290 I have enough stashed away<br />to give you a lavish life.
3906749 3910628 And if you don't want my dirty money,<br />I'll even work.
3911420 3914298 I'll stoop to selling odds and ends<br />on the street to support you.
3916008 3919761 I'll do anything<br />if you come with me.
3921888 3924015 Marry me, please.
3926809 3931480 If you say no, I have no choice<br />but to kill you.
3933440 3935234 Please, say yes.
3939821 3942615 Stop crying and answer me.
3943074 3944617 Tell me you'll be my wife!
3945618 3947536 Say it!
3959964 3960965 It's impossible.
3963301 3968597 How could I, a woman,<br />say anything?
3988948 3992660 I get it. You mean<br />it's up to us men to decide.
3995496 3996831 Hold it!
3998041 4002628 I refuse to risk my life<br />for such a woman.
4030070 4033739 You've been with two men.<br />Why don't you kill yourself?
4039578 4040913 Hopeless.
4044791 4048503 I don't want this shameless whore.<br />You can have her.
4050380 4054883 At this stage, I'd rather lose her<br />instead of the horse.
4110726 4111685 Wait!
4112352 4113145 Don't follow me!
4126573 4130368 Stop crying.<br />It's not going to work anymore.
4132829 4135539 Stop it. Don't bully her.
4137124 4139668 Women are weak by nature.
4166692 4168277 It's you who are weak.
4171280 4176993 If you are my husband,<br />why don't you kill this man?
4177744 4180955 Then you can tell me to kill myself.<br />That's a real man.
4182791 4185251 You're not a real man either.
4193717 4197386 When I heard you were Tajomaru,<br />I stopped crying.
4197804 4200306 I was sick of this<br />tiresome daily farce.
4201766 4207188 I thought, "Tajomaru might<br />get me out of this."
4207938 4213527 "If he'd only save me,<br />I'd do anything for him."
4213693 4214778 I thought to myself.
4220324 4223994 But you were just as petty<br />as my husband.
4225287 4226413 Just remember
4226831 4230583 that a woman loves a man<br />who loves passionately.
4231334 4234295 A man has to make a woman his<br />by his sword.
4574894 4577313 I don't want to die!
4744798 4747384 So that's the real story.
4747551 4750261 I don't tell lies.<br />I saw it with my own eyes.
4750553 4752179 I doubt it.
4752471 4754849 It's true. I don't lie.
4755016 4757184 No one lies after he says<br />he's going to do so.
4757351 4758728 It's horrifying.
4759478 4761980 If men don't trust each other,<br />this earth might as well be hell.
4762147 4763898 That's right.<br />This world is hell.
4764065 4766192 No, I believe in men.
4768069 4770446 I don't want this place to be hell.
4771280 4773574 Shouting doesn't help.
4773741 4777870 Think about it. Out of these three,<br />whose story is believable?
4778037 4781914 No idea.
4783124 4787629 In the end, you cannot<br />understand the things men do.
4849643 4850602 What are you doing?
4855481 4856899 What's it to you?
4860069 4862488 - That's terrible!<br />- Terrible?
4863030 4865698 Someone else would have<br />taken the kimono.
4866157 4867867 Why shouldn't I?
4869160 4871454 - It's evil.<br />- Evil?
4872205 4874665 What about this kid's parents?
4875374 4879545 They had their fun and then<br />they throw out the kid?
4879920 4881630 They're evil.
4881880 4883841 No, you're wrong.
4885341 4888511 Look at the amulet<br />on the kimono.
4888886 4891305 It was left to protect the baby.
4892056 4894976 Think about what they went through<br />to abandon this baby.
4895475 4897144 I don't have time to mind<br />everyone's feelings.
4897310 4900564 - You selfish...<br />- What's wrong with that?
4901231 4903734 Dogs are better off in this world.
4904484 4907403 If you're not selfish,<br />you can't survive.
4916494 4918580 Damn it.
4919664 4922876 Everyone is selfish<br />and dishonest.
4923418 4926045 Making excuses.
4927129 4932050 The bandit, the woman, the man
4934052 4935679 and you!
4942226 4946063 And you aren't?<br />That's funny.
4946647 4951276 You may have fooled the court,<br />but not me.
4967833 4970460 So what did you do<br />with the dagger?
4971336 4973254 The valuable one<br />with the pearl inlay
4973421 4976132 that Tajomaru was talking about?
4977050 4979718 What happened to it?<br />Did it disappear in the grass?
4982888 4984932 If you didn't, who stole it?
4988602 4990228 It seems I'm right.
4993689 4997985 A bandit calling another a bandit.<br />Now that's selfish.
5011997 5015000 Do you have<br />anything else to say?
5016168 5017336 If not, I'll be going.
5095698 5098951 What are you doing?<br />Taking what little it has left?
5109502 5113590 I have six kids of my own.
5115132 5122514 Another one<br />wouldn't make a difference.
5129729 5136276 I am ashamed of what I said.
5139488 5140614 It's inevitable
5141782 5147286 to be suspicious of others<br />on a day like this.
5151457 5153209 I'm the one<br />who should be ashamed.
5155710 5160340 I don't understand my own soul.
5160674 5163256 No, I'm grateful to you.
5176756 5180644 Thanks to you,
5182401 5186415 I think I can keep<br />my faith in man.
5187669 5188881 Don't mention it.
5286299 5291484 THE END
