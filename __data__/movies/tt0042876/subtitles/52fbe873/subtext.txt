167732 172028 I don't understand.<br />I just don't understand.
216573 220660 I don't understand it at all.
222495 224247 I just don't understand.
245685 247187 What's wrong?
250398 252484 What don't you understand?
255862 258698 I've never heard<br />such a strange story.
259240 261659 Why don't you<br />tell me about it?
262494 267373 We happen to have<br />a wise priest in our midst.
269167 275131 No, not even the renowned,<br />wise priest from Kiyomizu Temple
275840 279219 has heard a story<br />as strange as this.
280553 284140 So you know something<br />about this strange story?
284224 289729 This man and I have just seen it<br />and heard it ourselves.
289813 291564 Where?
292065 294067 In the courthouse garden.
294150 295819 The courthouse?
297237 299656 A man was murdered.
299739 303409 Just one? So what?
304369 307163 On top of this gate,
307622 311376 you'll find at least<br />five or six unclaimed bodies.
312377 314128 You're right.
314504 319801 War, earthquake, winds,
320593 324681 fire, famine, the plague...
325265 328768 Year after year,<br />it's been nothing but disasters.
333106 338444 And bandits descend upon us<br />every night.
339821 343366 I've seen so many men
343449 347704 getting killed like insects,
348955 354586 but even I have never heard<br />a story as horrible as this.
361259 364846 Yes. So horrible.
368766 370977 This time,
371811 375273 I may finally lose<br />my faith in the human soul.
375815 381821 It's worse than bandits,<br />the plague,
382697 387452 famine, fire, or war.
387994 390330 Look here, priest.
390914 393082 Enough with the sermon.
393166 397712 It sounded interesting,<br />at least while I kept out of the rain.
398004 402550 But if it's a sermon,<br />I'd sooner listen to the rain.
433831 436542 Hear me out.
436793 439337 Maybe you can tell me<br />what it means.
439420 443800 I don't understand<br />any of those three.
443883 446719 - Which three?<br />- Well -
447428 449973 I'll tell you about them.
450056 453059 Calm down<br />and tell me slowly.
453977 456896 The rain's not going to stop<br />any time soon.
457981 460483 RASHOMON
477083 479085 It was three days ago.
479669 483715 I went into the mountains<br />to get wood.
705728 708356 I ran as fast as I could<br />to tell the police.
709523 714362 Then, three days later - today,<br />I was called to testily
716072 718908 Yes, that's right.
722787 728501 I was the one<br />who first found the body.
728751 732004 What?<br />Did I see a sword or something?
732088 734924 No, nothing at all.
737009 740513 Just a woman's hat<br />caught on a branch,
741180 744850 and the cap of a samurai<br />that had been trampled on.
745434 749814 There was a cut-up piece of rope<br />near the body,
750856 754443 and further along in the leaves,
754527 758114 a shiny amulet case<br />with red lining.
758197 759865 Yes.
761200 766539 That was all I found, yes.
768457 770084 Yes.
771752 776924 I met the murdered man<br />before his death.
777842 783806 It was three days ago,<br />in the afternoon.
785474 789729 On the road from Sekiyama<br />to Yamashina.
807663 811917 The woman had a veil,
812585 814754 so I couldn't see her face.
815379 819842 The man was armed<br />with a sword,
819925 822595 as well as a bow and arrows.
825931 828059 Little did I expect
828684 833647 that he would meet such a fate.
835441 839195 A human life is truly as frail
839278 842573 and fleeting<br />as the morning dew.
844617 848454 What a shame<br />that his should end this way.
849205 851791 I'm sorry.
855461 860132 This man I caught is Tajomaru.
860966 866263 Yes, the notorious bandit<br />everyone speaks of.
868557 873562 The last time I almost caught him,<br />he looked the same
873646 876148 and he carried that same sword.
878359 882822 It was two days ago at dusk,<br />by the banks of the Katsura...
900214 903217 What's wrong?
914687 918774 There were 17 arrows<br />with eagle feathers,
919483 923487 a leather bow, and a horse.
924363 928200 All these belonged<br />to the dead man, yes.
930327 935958 The irony of Tajomaru being<br />thrown off his stolen horse,
936041 939044 this had to be fateful retribution.
946760 949221 I fell off the horse?
950347 952057 You fool!
955603 957229 On that day...
965946 969575 I was riding that horse<br />and I was suddenly very thirsty.
970242 972536 So around Osaka,<br />I drank from a spring.
985549 988677 There must have been<br />a dead poisonous snake upstream.
988761 992598 After a while, I got<br />an incredible stomachache.
992890 998020 By the time I came to the river,<br />I couldn't hold it any longer.
998771 1002816 So I got off the horse<br />and crouched in the field.
1007530 1009865 I fell off?
1010866 1013953 Obviously, a fool can think<br />only foolish thoughts.
1016747 1020709 I know sooner or later<br />you'll have my neck,
1021126 1023462 so I'm not going to<br />hide anything.
1026257 1029468 It was this Tajomaru<br />who killed that man.
1032137 1036225 I saw that couple three days ago.<br />It was a hot afternoon.
1036767 1040896 Suddenly a cool breeze<br />rustled the leaves.
1041689 1046569 If it hadn't been for that wind,<br />I wouldn't have killed him.
1200431 1205185 I caught a glimpse<br />and then she was gone.
1205644 1208063 Maybe that's why.
1208397 1211525 I thought I saw a goddess.
1211608 1214069 At that moment<br />I decided to capture her,
1214153 1216321 even if I had to kill her man.
1218866 1224413 But if I could have her<br />without killing, all the better.
1224496 1230294 My intention then was to take her<br />without killing the man.
1231962 1235632 But I couldn't do it<br />on that road to Yamashina.
1252608 1254276 What do you want?
1266997 1268499 What do you want?
1279718 1281220 What is it?
1301740 1303408 Don't be suspicious.
1306995 1309706 See? Isn't this nice?
1312376 1314503 Take a good look at it.
1320342 1325180 There are some ruins over there.
1325764 1328058 When I dug up the mound,
1328141 1332354 I found a heap of<br />swords and mirrors.
1332437 1335065 I buried them in a grove<br />behind the mountain
1335148 1337484 so no one else would find them.
1338277 1341280 If you're interested,<br />I'll sell them to you cheap.
1437000 1438877 It's over there.
1441338 1443173 Walk ahead of me.
1487259 1490762 It's here.<br />Beyond those pines.
1604876 1608880 Your husband has taken sick.
1616888 1620058 Her face turned pale.
1620142 1624187 She stared at me<br />with frozen eyes,
1624271 1628567 her expression<br />intense like a child's.
1629276 1630861 When I saw that,
1630944 1634489 I envied the man<br />and I suddenly hated him.
1634573 1639119 I wanted to show her how pathetic<br />he looked tied to that pine tree.
1639202 1643832 These thoughts that weren't there<br />before filled my head.
1737676 1741429 I had never seen<br />such fierceness in a woman.
1884114 1889202 And so I had succeeded in having her<br />without killing her husband.
1893331 1898545 I still had no intention<br />of killing him.
1899921 1901506 But then...
1903383 1904884 Wait!
1906511 1908096 Stop!
1909180 1914144 Either you die<br />or my husband dies.
1914644 1916729 One of you must die.
1927282 1932954 To have my shame known<br />to two men is worse than dying.
1935874 1939961 I will go
1940044 1944340 with the survivor.
2119432 2122769 So I had to kill him,<br />but I wanted to do it honorably.
2122852 2125438 He fought very well.
2125772 2128441 We crossed swords 23 times.
2128775 2133738 I remember this<br />because I'm still impressed.
2134113 2137742 No one had ever crossed swords<br />with me more than 20 times.
2142163 2145416 What? The woman?
2147085 2148836 I don't know.
2149504 2154050 When the man died,<br />I turned to her.
2154425 2156511 She was gone.
2157053 2162141 The fighting must have scared her<br />and she ran away.
2162517 2165728 I ran out to the mountain road.
2165812 2169023 All I found was her horse<br />grazing calmly.
2169857 2173528 I was attracted<br />to her fierce spirit,
2174570 2177990 but, after all,<br />she was just like other women.
2178366 2180952 I didn't even look for her.
2183496 2186874 What? His sword?
2188000 2191254 I exchanged it in town for liquor.
2192422 2195550 What? Her dagger?
2198344 2204308 It had pearl inlay.<br />Looked very valuable.
2205017 2207687 I totally forgot about it.
2208604 2210857 That was foolish.
2210940 2213234 The biggest mistake<br />I ever made!
2235256 2237383 Even amongst the bandits,
2237467 2241888 Tajomaru is famous<br />for being a womanizer.
2242597 2247560 Why, last fall,<br />a young wife went to the temple
2247643 2252440 and she and her maid were<br />found dead in the mountains.
2252523 2254692 That must have been him too.
2260782 2265912 Who knows what really happened<br />to that woman who left her horse?
2266704 2268539 Well,
2271417 2275254 that woman showed up<br />at the courthouse.
2278090 2284055 She was hiding in the temple<br />when the police found her.
2284305 2285807 It's a lie.
2286849 2291103 It's all a lie.<br />Tajomaru's story and the woman's.
2291729 2294440 It's human to lie.
2298277 2301697 Most of the time we can't even<br />be honest with ourselves.
2301781 2303741 That may be.
2309413 2314210 But it's because men are weak<br />that they lie,
2314293 2318256 even to themselves.
2318339 2320007 Not another sermon.
2321259 2326430 I don't care if it's a lie,<br />as long as it's entertaining.
2328558 2330768 What story did the woman<br />come up with?
2332186 2337733 Well, it's completely different<br />from Tajomaru's story.
2339360 2341320 So different
2341404 2347368 that her face didn't even<br />show the fierceness he spoke of.
2354166 2357795 She was so docile,<br />she was almost pitiful.
2386032 2388910 That man in the blue kimono,
2391495 2394165 after forcing me to yield to him,
2395666 2401422 proudly announced that<br />he was the infamous Tajomaru,
2404550 2409430 and laughed mockingly<br />at my husband who was tied up.
2419523 2421442 How horrified
2424070 2427698 my husband must have been.
2431243 2434413 The more he struggled,
2436999 2443965 the tighter the ropes dug in.
2447218 2450054 I ran to his side.
2450429 2454266 Or rather, I tried to.
2562291 2564210 Even now,
2566337 2568839 when I think of his eyes,
2569715 2573886 my blood turns cold in my veins.
2577389 2582103 What I saw in them was<br />neither anger,
2583354 2587316 nor sorrow,
2589527 2595491 but a cold light,<br />a look of loathing.
2603040 2604708 Don't.
2605334 2607711 Don't look at me like that.
2612758 2614426 It's too cruel.
2615719 2617972 Beat me,
2618889 2621142 kill me,
2621225 2626147 but don't look at me like that.<br />Please, stop.
2710272 2712524 Now kill me.
2713984 2716195 Kill me at once.
2750187 2751772 Stop.
2753023 2754275 Don't.
2760239 2761865 Please don't.
2805909 2812833 I must have fainted after that.
2821050 2823802 When I came to<br />and looked around...
2832102 2834772 Imagine my shock.
2848285 2854249 I saw my dagger
2855793 2860672 in my dead husband's chest.
2874436 2878690 I was in shock
2881193 2884696 and I don't remember<br />how I left the woods.
2890285 2892913 But when I came to,
2896208 2902172 I was standing by the pond<br />at the foot of the hill.
2909263 2912099 I threw myself into the pond.
2913851 2917521 I tried many different things.
2919565 2924445 But I failed to kill myself.
2936373 2940878 What should a poor,
2942963 2948385 helpless woman like me do?
2983212 2987049 I see. The more I hear,<br />the more confused I get.
2989259 2993013 But women use their tears<br />to fool everyone.
2993096 2995599 They even fool themselves.
2996433 3000395 So you have to beware<br />of the woman's story.
3002064 3005150 When you hear<br />the dead man's story -
3005234 3007277 He's dead.
3008278 3011073 How can he tell his story?
3011156 3013867 He spoke through a medium.
3015202 3016954 Lies.
3017663 3019831 His story was also lies.
3021625 3026296 But dead men don't lie.
3026964 3028840 Why is that?
3030634 3033887 I refuse to believe<br />that man would be so sinful.
3035264 3037683 Suit yourself.
3037766 3040644 But is there anyone who's<br />really good?
3040727 3043480 Maybe goodness is<br />just make-believe.
3043564 3045399 What a frightening -
3046358 3049778 Man just wants to forget<br />the bad stuff
3049861 3052155 and believe in the<br />made-up good stuff.
3052239 3055576 It's easier that way.<br />- Ridiculous.
3058996 3063834 Never mind.<br />Let's hear the dead man's story.
3110881 3114051 I am in darkness now.
3114468 3119431 I am suffering in the dark.
3119723 3124603 Cursed be those who cast me<br />into this dark hell.
3162599 3167521 After the bandit<br />attacked my wife,
3167604 3170190 he tried to console her.
3171775 3176947 She sat on the leaves,<br />staring down at her knees.
3177781 3181159 The bandit was cunning.
3181660 3183870 Now that her virtue was stained,
3183954 3186790 she could no longer be<br />with her husband
3186873 3190836 Leave the husband<br />and why not marry him instead?
3190919 3195382 He said he only attacked her<br />out of his love for her.
3196007 3198552 When she heard that,
3198635 3201972 my wife raised her face<br />as if in a trance.
3207561 3213275 She had never looked so beautiful.
3219823 3225787 And what was my beautiful wife's<br />response to the bandit
3225871 3230083 in front of her helpless husband?
3233503 3235213 Wherever.
3237841 3240427 Take me wherever you want.
3242429 3244639 That's what she said.
3247809 3251104 But that wasn't her only sin
3251188 3255817 or I wouldn't be suffering<br />in the dark like this.
3270874 3272876 Please kill him.
3272959 3276171 While he's alive,<br />I cannot go with you.
3276838 3278757 Kill him!
3279966 3283804 Those words were<br />like a wind that
3283887 3288016 threatened to blow me<br />into the depths of darkness.
3293063 3300612 Has such a hateful thing<br />ever been uttered by a human before?
3301112 3305200 Even the bandit turned pale<br />at those words.
3306785 3311706 Please kill him.
3346950 3350495 What do you want me<br />to do with her?
3351329 3356918 Kill her or save her?<br />You only have to nod.
3360463 3363508 For these words alone,
3363592 3367053 I was ready to pardon his crime.
3371308 3375312 Kill her or let her go?
3403882 3407344 I don't know<br />how many hours passed.
3449928 3451763 She got away.
3452305 3455016 Now I'll have to worry about<br />my own fate.
3480083 3482085 Everything was silent.
3483670 3486881 I heard someone crying.
3488049 3490635 Someone is crying.
3491594 3494347 Who is that?
3639659 3641744 Everything was silent.
3643663 3646124 How quiet it was.
3647876 3650879 Suddenly the sun went away.
3652505 3656968 I was enveloped in deep silence.
3659095 3664184 I lay there in the stillness.
3666728 3672108 Then someone<br />quietly approached me.
3673151 3678948 That someone<br />gently withdrew the dagger
3680575 3683995 from my heart.
3712899 3714484 It's not true!
3714567 3719322 There was no dagger.<br />He was killed by a sword.
3757235 3759988 Now it's getting interesting.
3760071 3765368 It seems you saw the whole thing.
3769539 3772417 So why didn't you tell the court?
3773543 3775962 I didn't want to get involved.
3776045 3778548 You can talk about it here, right?
3779590 3781259 Tell me, then.
3781342 3784470 Your story seems to be<br />the most interesting.
3784554 3789392 I don't want to hear it.<br />No more horror stories.
3790101 3792729 They are common stories<br />these days.
3792812 3794689 I even heard that
3794772 3799277 the demon living here in Rashomon<br />fled in fear of the ferocity of man.
3802905 3807327 Come on.<br />How much do you know?
3812248 3816044 I found the woman's hat<br />in the mountains.
3816127 3817920 You already said that.
3820423 3825887 About 20 yards further,<br />I heard a woman crying.
3826471 3828973 From behind a bush,
3829474 3834062 I saw a man tied up,<br />a woman crying and Tajomaru.
3835813 3840360 So you lied when you said<br />you found the body.
3840443 3843529 I didn't want to get involved.
3845448 3847950 All right, then. Go on.
3848493 3851120 What was Tajomaru doing?
3854165 3859045 He was down on his knees,<br />begging the woman for forgiveness.
3862006 3866886 Until now, whenever I wanted<br />to do something bad, I did it.
3866969 3869806 That way I suffered less.
3870640 3872809 But today, it's different.
3873267 3877397 I already had you,<br />but I only want you more.
3877480 3879524 It's very hard.
3879607 3882610 I beg you to be my wife.
3886489 3889534 The notorious bandit Tajomaru
3892078 3894831 is begging you<br />on his hands and knees.
3898084 3902046 If you wish,<br />I'll even stop being a bandit.
3902130 3906300 I have enough stashed away<br />to give you a lavish life.
3906384 3910555 And if you don't want my dirty money,<br />I'll even work.
3911055 3914892 I'll stoop to selling odds and ends<br />on the street to support you.
3915560 3920398 I'll do anything<br />if you come with me.
3921482 3924360 Marry me, please.
3926446 3931534 If you say no,<br />I have no choice but to kill you.
3933077 3935538 Please, say yes.
3939417 3942628 Stop crying and answer me.
3942712 3944797 Tell me you'll be my wife!
3945214 3947216 Say it!
3959520 3961522 It's impossible.
3962899 3968654 How could I, a woman,<br />say anything?
3988591 3992428 I get it. You mean<br />it's up to us men to decide.
3995056 3996849 Hold it!
3997600 4002271 I refuse to risk my life<br />for such a woman.
4029632 4033844 You've been with two men.<br />Why don't you kill yourself?
4039183 4041310 Hopeless.
4044355 4048609 I don't want this shameless whore.<br />You can have her.
4049944 4054574 At this stage, I'd rather lose her<br />instead of the horse.
4110296 4111839 Wait!
4111922 4113549 Don't follow me!
4126187 4130566 Stop crying.<br />It's not going to work anymore.
4132443 4135655 Stop it. Don't bully her.
4136697 4139784 Women are weak by nature.
4166268 4168229 It's you who are weak.
4170898 4176862 If you are my husband,<br />why don't you kill this man?
4177363 4181158 Then you can tell me to kill myself.<br />That's a real man.
4182368 4185121 You're not a real man either.
4193295 4197299 When I heard you were Tajomaru,<br />I stopped crying.
4197383 4200386 I was sick of this<br />tiresome daily farce.
4201387 4207101 I thought, "Tajomaru might<br />get me out of this."
4207601 4213232 "If he'd only save me,<br />I'd do anything for him."
4213315 4215317 I thought to myself.
4219947 4223659 But you were just as petty<br />as my husband.
4224952 4226412 Just remember:
4226495 4230499 A woman loves a man<br />who loves passionately.
4231000 4234503 A man has to make a woman his<br />by his sword.
4574510 4577096 I don't want to die!
4744429 4747140 So that's the real story.
4747224 4750102 I don't tell lies.<br />I saw it with my own eyes.
4750185 4752062 I doubt it.
4752145 4754564 It's true. I don't lie.
4754648 4757067 No one lies after he says<br />he's going to do so.
4757150 4758986 It's horrifying.
4759069 4762155 If men don't trust each other,<br />this earth might as well be hell.
4762239 4763782 That's right.<br />This world is hell.
4763865 4766201 No, I believe in men.
4767744 4770247 I don't want this place to be hell.
4770956 4773375 Shouting doesn't help.
4773458 4777629 Think about it. Out of these three,<br />whose story is believable?
4777713 4781591 No idea.
4782801 4787514 In the end, you cannot<br />understand the things men do.
4849368 4850952 What are you doing?
4855165 4857125 What's it to you?
4859795 4862672 - That's terrible!<br />- Terrible?
4862756 4865842 Someone else would have<br />taken the kimono.
4865926 4868136 Why shouldn't I?
4868887 4871431 - It's evil.<br />- Evil?
4871848 4874559 What about this kid's parents?
4875060 4879606 They had their fun<br />and then they throw out the kid?
4879689 4881483 They're evil.
4881566 4883944 No, you're wrong.
4885070 4888490 Look at the amulet<br />on the kimono.
4888573 4891576 It was left to protect the baby.
4891660 4894246 Think about what they went through<br />to abandon this baby.
4894329 4897249 I don't have time to mind<br />everyone's feelings.
4897332 4900836 - You selfish -<br />- What's wrong with that?
4900919 4904089 Dogs are better off in this world.
4904172 4907342 If you're not selfish,<br />you can't survive.
4916184 4918395 Damn it.
4919354 4923024 Everyone is selfish<br />and dishonest.
4923108 4926111 Making excuses.
4926736 4932033 The bandit,<br />the woman, the man
4933785 4935454 and you!
4941918 4945922 And you aren't?<br />That's funny.
4946339 4951303 You may have fooled the court,<br />but not me.
4967569 4970530 So what did you do<br />with the dagger?
4971031 4973492 The valuable one<br />with the pearl inlay
4973575 4976244 that Tajomaru was talking about?
4976745 4979748 What happened to it?<br />Did it disappear in the grass?
4980749 4985086 If you didn't, who stole it?
4988256 4990383 It seems I'm right.
4993428 4997766 A bandit calling another a bandit.<br />Now that's selfish.
5011655 5015116 Do you have<br />anything else to say?
5015867 5017869 If not, I'll be going.
5095405 5099284 What are you doing?<br />Taking what little it has left?
5109210 5113715 I have six kids of my own.
5114883 5122140 Another one<br />wouldn't make a difference.
5129439 5136029 I am ashamed of what I said.
5139240 5141076 It's inevitable
5141493 5147207 to be suspicious of others<br />on a day like this.
5151127 5153630 I'm the one<br />who should be ashamed.
5155423 5160095 I don't understand my own soul.
5160178 5163473 No, I'm grateful to you.
5176444 5180448 Thanks to you,
5182200 5186538 I think I can keep<br />my faith in man.
5187372 5189040 Don't mention it.
5286012 5290600 THE END
