168210 172422 I don’t understand ….<br />I just don’t understand.
217092 220095 <i>I don’t understand it at all.</i>
223015 224558 I just don’t understand.
246079 247331 What’s wrong?
250834 252294 What don’t you understand?
256381 258926 I’ve never heard<br />such a strange story.
259801 261303 Why don’t you tell me about it?
262888 267351 We happen to have<br />a wise priest in our midst.
269686 274858 No, not even the renowned, wise<br />priest from Kiyomizu Temple
276235 279446 has heard a story<br />as strange as this.
279738 283909 So you know something<br />about this strange story?
284660 289581 This man and I have just seen<br />it and heard it ourselves.
290123 294002 —Where?<br />—In the courthouse garden.
294378 295712 The courthouse?
297673 299758 A man was murdered.
300384 303095 Just one? So what?
304680 311895 On top of this gate, you’ll find<br />at least five or six unclaimed bodies.
312896 314982 You’re right.
315107 320028 War, earthquake, winds,
321113 325158 fire, famine, the plague ….
325450 328495 Year after year,<br />it’s been nothing but disasters.
333625 338338 And bandits descend upon us<br />every night.
340090 347347 I’ve seen so many men<br />getting killed like insects,
349183 355397 but even I have never heard<br />a story as horrible as this.
361486 365073 Yes. So horrible.
369077 374917 This time, I may finally lose<br />my faith in the human soul.
376251 380464 It’s worse than bandits,<br />the plague,
380964 387304 famine, fire, or war.
388347 390807 Look here, priest.
391517 393560 Enough with the sermon.
393727 397606 It sounded interesting,<br />at least while I kept out of the rain.
398315 402277 But if it’s a sermon,<br />I’d sooner listen to the rain.
434059 439481 Hear me out. Maybe you can<br />tell me what it means.
439565 443819 I don’t understand<br />any of those three.
443986 446780 —Which three?<br />—Well ….
447406 450117 I’ll tell you about them.
450284 452578 Calm down and tell me slowly.
454121 457374 The rain’s not going to stop<br />any time soon.
458458 460961 RASHOMON
477769 479563 It was three days ago.
480314 484109 I went into the mountains<br />to get wood.
706164 708500 <i>I ran as fast as I could</i><br /><i>to tell the police.</i>
709543 713839 <i>Then, three days later—today—</i><br /><i>I was called to testify.</i>
716466 719136 Yes. That’s right.
723182 728812 I was the one<br />who first found the body.
729062 732274 What? Did I see a sword<br />or something?
732357 735152 No, nothing at all.
737404 740199 Just a woman’s hat<br />caught on a branch,
741575 745078 and the cap of a samurai<br />that had been trampled on.
745787 749458 There was a cut-up piece of rope<br />near the body,
751251 758467 and further along in the leaves,<br />a shiny amulet case with red lining.
758592 760260 Yes.
761678 767226 That was all I found, yes.
768852 770521 Yes.
772231 777027 I met the murdered man<br />before his death.
778195 783534 It was three days ago,<br />in the afternoon.
783659 785577 On the road
785744 789998 from Sekiyama to Yamashina.
808016 814523 <i>The woman had a veil,</i><br /><i>so I couldn’t see her face.</i>
826451 833417 Little did I expect<br />that he would meet such a fate.
835836 842509 A human life is truly as frail<br />and fleeting as the morning dew.
845137 849183 What a shame<br />that his should end this way.
849600 852102 I’m sorry.
855856 860277 This man I caught is Tajōmaru.
861486 866533 Yes, the notorious bandit<br />everyone speaks of.
869077 873916 The last time I almost caught him,<br />he looked the same
874082 876460 and he carried that same sword.
878879 883133 It was two days ago at dusk,<br />by the banks of the Katsura ….
900150 903987 What’s wrong?
915249 919127 <i>There were 17 arrows</i><br /><i>with eagle feathers,</i>
919211 923757 <i>a leather bow, and a horse.</i>
924675 928554 All these belonged<br />to the dead man, yes.
930681 936019 The irony of Tajōmaru being<br />thrown off his stolen horse,
936562 938772 this had to be fateful retribution.
947197 951910 I fell off the horse?<br />You fool!
955873 957541 On that day …
966508 969094 I was riding that horse<br />and I was suddenly very thirsty.
970554 972681 So around Osaka,<br />I drank from a spring.
985861 988614 There must have been<br />a dead poisonous snake upstream.
989239 992409 After a while, I got<br />an incredible stomachache.
993327 997831 By the time I came to the river,<br />I couldn’t hold it any longer.
998999 1002794 So I got off the horse<br />and crouched in the field.
1008008 1010344 I fell off?
1011470 1013597 Obviously, a fool can think only<br />foolish thoughts.
1017017 1020270 I know sooner or later<br />you’ll have my neck,
1021355 1023398 so I’m not going to hide anything.
1026568 1029321 It was this Tajōmaru<br />who killed that man.
1032491 1035953 I saw that couple three days ago.<br />It was a hot afternoon.
1037037 1040499 Suddenly a cool breeze<br />rustled the leaves.
1041959 1046630 If it hadn’t been for that wind,<br />I wouldn’t have killed him.
1200742 1204955 I caught a glimpse<br />and then she was gone.
1206123 1207958 Maybe that’s why.
1208625 1211712 I thought I saw a goddess.
1212337 1215591 At that moment I decided to capture her,<br />even if I had to kill her man.
1219178 1224308 But if I could have her<br />without killing, all the better.
1224808 1229938 My intention then was to take her<br />without killing the man.
1232357 1235777 But I couldn’t do it<br />on that road to Yamashina.
1252878 1254296 What do you want?
1267601 1269061 What do you want?
1279947 1281323 What is it?
1302010 1303762 Don’t be suspicious.
1307391 1309393 See? Isn’t this nice?
1312604 1314356 Take a good look at it.
1321488 1325158 There are some ruins over there.
1325993 1331665 When I dug up the mound, I found<br />a heap of swords and mirrors.
1332666 1336587 I buried them in a grove behind the mountain<br />so no one else would find them.
1338547 1341508 If you’re interested,<br />I’ll sell them to you cheap.
1437271 1438981 It’s over there.
1441358 1442943 Walk ahead of me.
1487571 1490449 It’s here. Beyond those pines.
1604646 1609359 Your husband<br />has taken sick.
1617117 1624041 Her face turned pale.<br />She stared at me with frozen eyes,
1624333 1628086 her expression intense like a child’s.
1629505 1633926 When I saw that, I envied the man<br />and I suddenly hated him.
1634801 1638931 I wanted to show her how pathetic<br />he looked tied to that pine tree.
1639473 1643810 These thoughts that weren’t there<br />before filled my head.
1739198 1741241 <i>I had never seen</i><br /><i>such fierceness in a woman.</i>
1884468 1888847 And so I had succeeded in having<br />her without killing her husband.
1893602 1898273 I still had no intention<br />of killing him.
1900150 1901693 But then ….
1903612 1905280 Wait!
1906740 1908325 Stop!
1909326 1913789 Either you die or my husband dies.
1914790 1916834 One of you must die.
1927594 1932808 To have my shame known to<br />two men is worse than dying.
1936144 1944486 I will go with the survivor.
2119828 2122789 So I had to kill him,<br />but I wanted to do it honourably.
2123332 2127711 He fought very well.<br />We crossed swords 23 times.
2129046 2133634 I remember this<br />because I’m still impressed.
2134468 2137888 No one had ever crossed swords<br />with me more than 20 times.
2142559 2145395 What? The woman?
2147481 2149441 I don’t know.
2149942 2155739 When the man died,<br />I turned to her. She was gone.
2157324 2161703 The fighting must have scared her<br />and she ran away.
2162788 2165332 I ran out to the mountain road.
2165707 2168585 All I found was her horse<br />grazing calmly.
2170128 2173966 I was attracted to her fierce spirit,
2174424 2177928 but, after all, she was just<br />like other women.
2178554 2180472 I didn’t even look for her.
2183851 2186520 What? His sword?
2188355 2190941 I exchanged it in town for liquor.
2192609 2195487 What? Her dagger?
2198031 2204371 It had pearl inlay.<br />Looked very valuable.
2205205 2210586 I totally forgot about it.<br />That was foolish.
2211086 2213130 The biggest mistake I ever made!
2235569 2241074 Even amongst the bandits,<br />Tajōmaru is famous for being a womanizer.
2242910 2248081 Why, last fall, a young wife went<br />to the temple and she and her maid
2248248 2253921 were found dead in the mountains.<br />That must have been him too.
2261094 2265390 Who knows what really happened<br />to that woman who left her horse?
2267226 2268894 Well,
2271647 2274942 that woman showed up<br />at the courthouse.
2278403 2284201 She was hiding in the temple<br />when the police found her.
2284576 2286078 It’s a lie.
2286995 2291041 It’s all a lie.<br />Tajōmaru’s story and the woman’s.
2292000 2294336 It’s human to lie.
2298549 2301802 Most of the time we can’t even<br />be honest with ourselves.
2302135 2303929 That may be.
2309768 2318360 But it’s because men are weak<br />that they lie, even to themselves.
2318569 2320487 Not another sermon.
2321488 2326034 I don’t care if it’s a lie,<br />as long as it’s entertaining.
2328996 2331248 What story did the woman<br />come up with?
2332499 2337421 Well, it’s completely different<br />from Tajōmaru’s story.
2339715 2347139 So different that her face didn’t even<br />show the fierceness he spoke of.
2354605 2357649 She was so docile,<br />she was almost pitiful.
2386637 2388680 That man in the blue kimono,
2392100 2394937 after forcing me to yield to him,
2396230 2401818 proudly announced that<br />he was the infamous Tajōmaru,
2405030 2409368 and laughed mockingly at my husband<br />who was tied up.
2420462 2428178 How horrified my husband<br />must have been.
2431723 2434852 The more he struggled,
2437646 2444903 the tighter the ropes dug in.
2447614 2454580 I ran to his side. Or rather, I tried to.
2562980 2568944 Even now, when I think of his eyes,
2570445 2574366 my blood turns cold in my veins.
2578203 2582666 What I saw in them was neither anger,
2584001 2585502 nor sorrow,
2587087 2596013 but a cold light, a look of loathing.
2603520 2605189 Don’t.
2606064 2608192 Don’t look at me like that.
2613280 2614740 It’s too cruel.
2616366 2618452 Beat me,
2619453 2626210 kill me, but don’t look at me like that.<br />Please, stop.
2710878 2713005 Now kill me.
2714089 2716508 Kill me at once.
2750667 2752044 Stop.
2753670 2755214 Don’t.
2760802 2762304 Please don’t.
2806348 2812187 I must have fainted after that.
2821572 2824324 When I came to<br />and looked around ….
2832875 2835502 Imagine my shock.
2852227 2860569 I saw my dagger<br />in my dead husband’s chest.
2875209 2878670 I was in shock
2881673 2884635 and I don’t remember<br />how I left the woods.
2890724 2893101 But when I came to,
2896897 2898941 I was standing by the pond,
2900567 2902402 at the foot of the hill.
2909743 2911912 I threw myself into the pond.
2914122 2918085 I tried many different things.
2919962 2924299 But I failed to kill myself.
2936687 2948156 What should a poor,<br />helpless woman like me do?
2983692 2987154 I see. The more I hear,<br />the more confused I get.
2989865 2993285 But women use their tears<br />to fool everyone.
2993619 2995746 They even fool themselves.
2996997 3000584 So you have to beware<br />of the woman’s story.
3002628 3005214 When you hear<br />the dead man’s story—
3005797 3011178 He’s dead.<br />How can he tell his story?
3011803 3013931 He spoke through a medium.
3015766 3019728 Lies. His story was also lies.
3022314 3026610 But dead men don’t lie.
3027569 3029446 Why is that?
3031198 3034284 I refuse to believe<br />that man would be so sinful.
3035911 3037496 Suit yourself.
3038372 3040374 But is there anyone who’s<br />really good?
3041291 3044253 Maybe goodness is just make-believe.
3044294 3046129 What a frightening—
3047089 3049716 Man just wants to forget<br />the bad stuff
3050509 3052719 and believe in the made-up<br />good stuff.
3052761 3055764 —It’s easier that way.<br />—Ridiculous.
3059393 3060894 Never mind.
3061144 3063814 Let’s hear the dead man’s story.
3111653 3114990 I am in darkness now.
3115073 3119536 I am suffering in the dark.
3120412 3125250 Cursed be those who cast me<br />into this dark hell.
3163372 3170337 After the bandit attacked my wife,<br />he tried to console her.
3171964 3177344 <i>She sat on the leaves,</i><br /><i>staring down at her knees.</i>
3178554 3181515 <i>The bandit was cunning.</i>
3182391 3184685 <i>Now that her virtue was stained,</i>
3184893 3186937 <i>she could no longer be</i><br /><i>with her husband.</i>
3187104 3191108 <i>Leave the husband</i><br /><i>and why not marry him instead?</i>
3191441 3195237 <i>He said he only attacked her</i><br /><i>out of his love for her.</i>
3196989 3201577 <i>When she heard that, my wife</i><br /><i>raised her face as if in a trance.</i>
3208250 3213839 She had never looked so beautiful.
3220596 3227311 <i>And what was my beautiful wife’s</i><br /><i>response to the bandit</i>
3228687 3230647 <i>in front of her helpless husband?</i>
3234109 3235777 Wherever.
3238447 3240991 Take me wherever you want.
3243035 3245204 That’s what she said.
3248540 3251168 But that wasn’t her only sin
3252002 3256173 or I wouldn’t be suffering<br />in the dark like this.
3271313 3272898 Please kill him.
3273607 3276318 While he’s alive,<br />I cannot go with you.
3277361 3278987 Kill him!
3280656 3284785 Those words were like a wind that
3285202 3288497 threatened to blow me<br />into the depths of darkness.
3293752 3301510 Has such a hateful thing<br />ever been uttered by a human before?
3301885 3305848 Even the bandit turned pale<br />at those words.
3307391 3312020 Please kill him.
3347431 3350559 What do you want me<br />to do with her?
3352060 3356982 Kill her or save her?<br />You only have to nod.
3361069 3367242 <i>For these words alone,</i><br /><i>I was ready to pardon his crime.</i>
3370412 3375959 Kill her or let her go?
3404613 3407449 <i>I don’t know</i><br /><i>how many hours passed.</i>
3450367 3454162 She got away. Now I’ll have<br />to worry about my own fate.
3480522 3482357 <i>Everything was silent.</i>
3484276 3487779 <i>I heard someone crying.</i>
3488739 3491450 <i>Someone is crying.</i>
3492284 3494244 <i>Who is that?</i>
3640057 3641767 Everything was silent.
3643936 3645979 How quiet it was.
3648106 3650234 Suddenly the sun went away.
3652861 3656782 I was enveloped in deep silence.
3659618 3664456 I lay there in the stillness.
3667376 3672381 Then someone quietly approached me.
3673590 3683976 That someone gently withdrew<br />the dagger from my heart.
3713255 3714882 It’s not true!
3714965 3718969 There was no dagger.<br />He was killed by a sword.
3757591 3759718 Now it’s getting interesting.
3760469 3765015 It seems you saw the whole thing.
3769895 3772231 So why didn’t you tell the court?
3773857 3776109 I didn’t want to get involved.
3776527 3778487 You can talk about it here, right?
3779947 3782533 Tell me, then.
3782699 3784868 Your story seems to be<br />the most interesting.
3785077 3789122 I don’t want to hear it.<br />No more horror stories.
3790457 3792960 They are common stories<br />these days.
3793335 3796463 I even heard that the demon living<br />here in Rashomon
3796630 3799132 fled in fear of the ferocity of man.
3803220 3807057 Come on.<br />How much do you know?
3812604 3815983 I found the woman’s hat<br />in the mountains.
3816316 3818110 You already said that.
3820821 3825450 About 20 yards further,<br />I heard a woman crying.
3826743 3830998 From behind a bush,<br />I saw a man tied up,
3831373 3834209 a woman crying and Tajōmaru.
3834251 3835919 So you lied
3836128 3840507 when you said<br />you found the body.
3840632 3842593 I didn’t want to get involved.
3842676 3844303 All right, then.
3845888 3850392 Go on.<br />What was Tajōmaru doing?
3854521 3859318 He was down on his knees,<br />begging the woman for forgiveness.
3862279 3866909 Until now, whenever I wanted<br />to do something bad, I did it.
3867242 3869703 That way I suffered less.
3871163 3873707 But today, it’s different.
3873916 3879296 I already had you, but I only<br />want you more. It’s very hard.
3880214 3882633 I beg you to be my wife.
3887095 3894102 The notorious bandit Tajōmaru<br />is begging you on his hands and knees.
3898607 3901860 If you wish, I’ll even stop<br />being a bandit.
3902736 3905572 I have enough stashed away<br />to give you a lavish life.
3906949 3910994 And if you don’t want my dirty money,<br />I’ll even work.
3911537 3917835 I’ll stoop to selling odds and ends<br />on the street to support you.
3918502 3921880 I’ll do anything<br />if you come with me.
3921922 3924716 Marry me, please.
3927010 3929805 If you say no,<br />I have no choice but to kill you.
3933350 3935727 Please, say yes.
3939898 3942526 Stop crying and answer me.
3943235 3944862 Tell me you’ll be my wife!
3945571 3948282 Say it!
3959960 3961461 It’s impossible.
3963422 3968510 How could I, a woman,<br />say anything?
3989031 3992326 I get it. You mean<br />it’s up to us men to decide.
3995454 3996663 Hold it!
3998040 4002211 I refuse to risk my life<br />for such a woman.
4030280 4033492 You’ve been with two men.<br />Why don’t you kill yourself?
4039790 4041208 Hopeless.
4044920 4048423 I don’t want this shameless whore.<br />You can have her.
4050342 4055013 At this stage, I’d rather lose her<br />instead of the horse.
4110736 4112946 —Wait!<br />—Don’t follow me!
4126710 4130339 Stop crying.<br />It’s not going to work anymore.
4132925 4136428 Stop it. Don’t bully her.
4137179 4139556 Women are weak by nature.
4166834 4168335 It’s you who are weak.
4171588 4173465 If you are my husband,
4174383 4177094 why don’t you kill this man?
4178053 4180681 Then you can tell me to kill myself.<br />That’s a real man.
4182933 4185269 You’re not a real man either.
4193861 4197322 When I heard you were Tajōmaru,<br />I stopped crying.
4197990 4200325 I was sick of this tiresome daily farce.
4201994 4207791 I thought, “Tajōmaru might<br />get me out of this.”
4208208 4213672 If he’d only save me,<br />I’d do anything for him.
4213922 4215799 I thought to myself.
4220512 4223932 But you were just as petty<br />as my husband.
4225767 4230689 Just remember: A woman loves a man<br />who loves passionately.
4231440 4234526 A man has to make a woman his<br />by his sword.
4575158 4577452 I don’t want to die!
4744786 4746997 So that’s the real story.
4747539 4750209 I don’t tell lies.<br />I saw it with my own eyes.
4750709 4752211 I doubt it.
4752628 4755088 It’s true. I don’t lie.
4755339 4757382 No one lies after he says<br />he’s going to do so.
4757549 4759301 It’s horrifying.
4759510 4762262 If men don’t trust each other,<br />this earth might as well be hell.
4762513 4764139 That’s right. This world is hell.
4764306 4765974 No, I believe in men.
4768185 4770312 I don’t want this place to be hell.
4771230 4773232 Shouting doesn’t help.
4773815 4777945 Think about it. Out of these three,<br />whose story is believable?
4778237 4779613 No idea.
4780656 4782032 No idea.
4783242 4787246 In the end, you cannot understand<br />the things men do.
4849766 4851310 What are you doing?
4855564 4856940 What’s it to you?
4860110 4862529 —That’s terrible!<br />—Terrible?
4863113 4867618 Someone else would have taken<br />the kimono. Why shouldn’t I?
4869328 4871788 —It’s evil.<br />—Evil?
4872497 4874750 What about this kid’s parents?
4875501 4881215 They had their fun and then they<br />throw out the kid? They’re evil.
4881965 4884343 No, you’re wrong.
4885511 4891350 Look at the amulet on the kimono.<br />It was left to protect the baby.
4892267 4895062 Think about what they went through<br />to abandon this baby.
4895562 4897731 I don’t have time to mind<br />everyone’s feelings.
4897898 4900317 —You selfish ….<br />—What’s wrong with that?
4901235 4903695 Dogs are better off in this world.
4904488 4907533 If you’re not selfish,<br />you can’t survive.
4916875 4919002 Damn it.
4919837 4922673 Everyone is selfish and dishonest.
4923465 4926510 Making excuses.
4927678 4935936 The bandit, the woman,<br />the man and you!
4942276 4945904 And you aren’t? That’s funny.
4946780 4951076 You may have fooled the court,<br />but not me.
4967968 4970429 So what did you do<br />with the dagger?
4971263 4974558 The valuable one<br />with the pearl inlay
4974933 4976852 that Tajōmaru was talking about?
4977311 4980022 What happened to it?<br />Did it disappear in the grass?
4981148 4984610 If you didn’t, who stole it?
4988614 4990282 It seems I’m right.
4993744 4998207 A bandit calling another a bandit.<br />Now that’s selfish.
5012221 5015057 Do you have anything else to say?
5016350 5018060 If not, I’ll be going.
5095929 5099099 What are you doing?<br />Taking what little it has left?
5109651 5113614 I have six kids of my own.
5115449 5122497 Another one<br />wouldn’t make a difference.
5129880 5136386 I am ashamed of what I said.
5139640 5147439 It’s inevitable to be suspicious of others<br />on a day like this.
5151652 5153654 I’m the one<br />who should be ashamed.
5155906 5160369 I don’t understand my own soul.
5160911 5163956 No, I’m grateful to you.
5177010 5179012 Thanks to you,
5179930 5186687 I think I can keep<br />my faith in man.
5187855 5189481 Don’t mention it.
5286411 5290999 THE END
