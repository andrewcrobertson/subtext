167750 172088 l can't understand it.<br />l can't understand it at all
216841 220845 l just can't understand it
222304 224140 l just can't fathom it
245578 247580 What's the mafter?
250249 252251 What can't you understand?
255921 258591 The strangest thing l ever heard of
259300 261302 Tell me about it
262511 267308 lt's just as well we have<br />a wise priest here
269226 275191 Even Abbot Konin of the Kiyomizu Temple,<br />renowned for his learning...
275316 278861 ...wouldn't be able<br />to understand this
278986 283324 So you know something about it, too?
283991 289538 Today l've heard it with my own ears,<br />seen it with my own eyes
289663 293751 -Where?<br />-ln the prison courtyard
293876 295544 The prison?
297379 299590 A man has been murdered
299715 303385 What of it? One or two more...
304011 308682 Only one? You'll always *nd bodies<br />left on the top of this gate
309391 311393 No one bothers about them
312394 314480 Yes, you are right
314605 320069 Wars, earthquakes, great winds...
320528 324740 ...*res, famine, plague...
325407 328744 ...each year is full of disasters
333207 335209 And now, every night...
335876 337878 ...bandits prey on us
339880 345886 l've seen hundreds of men dying,<br />killed like animals
348597 354562 Yet even l have never heard anything<br />as horrible before
361277 364613 lt's horrible
368617 374623 There was never anything<br />as terrible as this
375291 381338 lt is more horrible<br />than *res or wars...
382631 386635 ...or epidemics, or bandits
387970 389972 Gome on, priest...
390639 392641 ...spare us the sermons
393350 397354 l only wanted to hear the story<br />to pass the time until the rain stops
398022 402026 But l'd sooner listen to the rain<br />than any sermons from you
433682 436560 Hey, listen to me
436685 443567 Perhaps you can tell me what it<br />all means. Äll three of them...
443692 449698 -Three?<br />-The three l wanted to tell you about
449823 452785 All right, but take it easy
453827 456121 This rain won't stop yet
476809 479353 lt was three days ago
479478 483482 l'd gone to the hills to cut wood
705621 709166 <i>Iran to tellthepolice</i>
710500 715172 <i>That was three days ago.<br />Todayl was calledtogive evidence</i>
717174 719176 Yes, sir
722638 727893 lt was me who found the body
730187 734650 Was there a sword?<br />No, nothing like that
736944 743242 All l saw was a woman's hat,<br />caught on a branch
745327 749498 And a man's hat that had been<br />trodden on
750832 757339 And a piece of rope...<br />and an amulet case of red brocade
761301 766265 Yes, sir, that was all l saw.<br />l swear it
771561 776233 l saw the murdered man<br />when he was still alive
777609 782239 lt was about three days ago,<br />in the afternoon
783407 789871 lt was on the road between<br />Sekiyama and Yamashina
807472 813770 <i>Herhathada veil.<br />Icouldn'tsee her*ce</i>
815147 821778 <i>The man was armed<br />He hada swor* bowandarro*</i>
825782 829202 l never expected to see him again.
829328 832831 Then, to see him dead like that...
835292 841840 True, life is ephemeral,<br />as fleeting as the morning dew
845886 851183 But the pity of it, what a pity<br />he should have died like that
855187 859858 Yes, it was me who caught Tajomaru
862361 864571 The notorious bandit
868575 871870 He was dressed as you see him now...
872579 875916 ...carrying that Korean sword
878585 883256 lt was the day before yesterday,<br />on the riverbank at Katsura
914663 920669 <i>There was a black-Iac*uered*uiver<br />holding seventeen arro*, anda bow</i>
921336 923338 <i>Andthere was agreyhorse</i>
924381 928718 They all belonged<br />to the murdered man
930720 935892 lmagine a bandit like Tajomaru being<br />thrown by the horse he had stolen!
936017 938478 It was retribution
946903 951408 Retribution? Don't be stupid!
955412 957414 On that day...
966339 969676 ...l suddenly became very thirsty
970218 973013 So l stopped to drink at a stream
985609 988653 There must have been a snake<br />or something upstream...
988778 992616 ...because soon<br />l had a terrible bellyache
992741 997621 l had to get off the horse<br />and lie down
998872 1002584 And you thought l'd fallen off!
1007797 1013261 You must be a stupid idiot<br />to get such a stupid idea!
1016806 1022896 L'm telling the truth. l know<br />you'll cut my head off sooner or later
1026233 1028860 lt was me, Tajomaru, who killed him
1032197 1035575 l saw them in the hot afternoon,<br />about three days ago
1036910 1040247 Suddenly, there was this cool breeze
1041581 1046253 lf it wasn't for that breeze<br />l wouldn't have killed him
1200407 1204411 Just a glimpse, then she was gone
1205578 1210792 l thought l'd seen an angel.<br />There and then l decided to have her
1211584 1215588 l'd have her<br />even if l had to kill the man
1218967 1224264 But it would be even befter<br />if l could do it without killing him
1224389 1230270 So l decided to get the woman<br />alone somehow
1231980 1235275 The road to Yamashina was<br />hardly the place, though
1252500 1254461 What is it?
1301591 1303593 Isn't that splendid?
1306971 1309599 Just look
1312310 1314312 Here, take it
1323196 1327325 Near here, l found an old tomb<br />with lots of such things in it
1327450 1331746 Swords, daggers, mirrors
1331871 1336209 l've buried them.<br />No one but me knows where
1338211 1340880 l could sell you some cheap
1436768 1438603 lt's over in that grove
1441105 1443107 Walk ahead of me
1487360 1490530 lt's over there
1603976 1605770 lt's your husband...
1607438 1609941 A snake has biften your husband
1616781 1623121 She went pale and stared at me<br />as though her eyes were frozen
1624038 1627875 She looked like a child<br />when suddenly it turns serious
1629252 1634423 That made me jealous of that man,<br />l began to hate him
1634549 1638553 l wanted to show her<br />what he looked like, tied up like that
1639262 1643641 l didn't think of such a thing before,<br />but now l did
1739028 1741447 She was *erce, determined
1884382 1889053 l had her, just as l had planned,<br />and without killing the husband
1893391 1898437 Besides, l hadn't intended to kill him
1900022 1901732 But then...
1903317 1904652 Wait!
1909115 1911659 One of you must die
1911784 1915788 Either you or my husband
1927174 1932638 To be doubly disgraced before two men<br />is more than l can bear
1937518 1944442 l will belong to whoever kills the other
2119241 2124580 l wanted to kill him fairly,<br />and he fought really well
2125664 2128459 We crossed swords<br />more than twenty times
2128584 2133255 No one had ever crossed more<br />than twenty times with me before
2133922 2137301 Then l killed him
2141930 2145309 What's that? The woman?
2151023 2155653 She was nowhere to be seen
2157321 2161867 She probably took fright<br />and ran away
2162534 2165871 She must have been in a state
2165996 2169333 Anyhow, when l came back,<br />l found the horse grazing there
2170000 2173337 lt was the woman's temper<br />that interested me
2174672 2177383 But she was just like any other woman
2178676 2180678 l didn't even look for her
2183389 2186684 What? His sword?
2188018 2191397 I sold that and drank up the money
2192398 2195401 Her dagger?
2197778 2204076 I remember, it looked valuable,<br />with a kind of inlay in it
2204743 2210124 l forgot all about it.<br />What a stupid thing to do
2210749 2212751 My biggest mistake
2235357 2241488 Tajomaru, he's notorious,<br />worse than all the other bandits in Kyoto
2242781 2247494 Last autumn, a girl and her maid went<br />to worship at the Toribe Temple
2247619 2254168 They were found murdered.<br />He must have done it
2260841 2265554 The woman left her horse behind?<br />l bet he killed her
2266847 2268474 Yes, but...
2271560 2274855 But she gave evidence, too
2278233 2283572 She sought refuge in a temple<br />and the police found her there
2284239 2285574 lt's a lie!
2286909 2290913 All lies: Tajomaru's confession,<br />the woman's story
2291830 2294917 People are only people,<br />that's why they lie
2298253 2301507 They can't even admit the truth<br />to themselves
2301632 2304259 That may be true
2309473 2312935 lt's because men are so weak
2314311 2318190 That's why they lie,<br />to deceive themselves
2318315 2319900 Not another sermon!
2321318 2326323 I don't mind a lie,<br />not if it's interesting
2328659 2330994 What was her story?
2332329 2337000 It was quite different<br />from the bandit's
2339002 2340671 Everything was different
2341713 2347719 Tajomaru talked of her temper,<br />her strength. l saw nothing like that
2354393 2357604 She was pitiful,<br />l felt great compassion for her
2382129 2388010 Then...<br />after taking advantage of me...
2391430 2393390 ...he said, so proudly...
2395559 2401148 ...he was the famous bandit Tajomaru
2404276 2408947 Then he sneered at my husband
2424046 2426965 How terrible it must have been for him
2430969 2434348 But the more he struggled...
2436975 2439645 ...the tighter the rope became
2442356 2443649 l couldn't stand it
2447027 2453700 Not realising what l was doing,<br />l ran towards him, or tried to
2562184 2563810 And l...
2566313 2572611 Even now l remember his eyes
2577282 2581953 What l saw in them<br />was not sorrow
2583288 2585957 lt was not even anger
2589294 2595300 Not even pity.<br />lt was a cold hatred of me
2602891 2607062 Don't look at me like that
2612692 2614111 Don't!
2615695 2620659 Beat me, kill me,<br />but don't look at me like that
2623245 2625247 Please don't
2710123 2716213 Then kill me if you will.<br />Kill me with one stroke, quickly
2750121 2751706 Please don't
2805885 2807679 And then l...
2810557 2812559 Then l fainted
2820900 2823194 When l recovered<br />and looked around...
2832120 2835123 Then l saw him
2851806 2859773 l saw the dagger<br />in my husband's chest
2874537 2878458 l ran and ran and ran<br />through the forest...
2881044 2884172 l must have,<br />although l don't remember
2890261 2892263 When l came to my senses...
2896184 2898311 ...l found myself by a pool...
2899938 2902315 ...outside the forest
2909656 2912325 l threw myself in
2913660 2917455 l tried to kill myself<br />in other ways, too
2919499 2923795 But l failed in my aftempts
2936266 2940603 l was just a helpless woman...
2942856 2948486 Your Honour, what is a poor<br />helpless woman like me to do?
2984189 2987233 The more l hear,<br />the more confused l am
2989194 2995200 Women lead you on with their tears,<br />they even fool themselves
2996326 2999662 lf l believed her,<br />l'd be really mixed up
3001664 3004876 But according to the husband's story...
3005001 3010381 But he's dead.<br />How could a dead man talk?
3011007 3013676 He spoke through a medium
3015011 3019140 Lies! His story was all lies
3021684 3025939 But dead men tell no lies
3026856 3029067 Why is that, priest?
3030693 3033738 They must not.<br />l must not believe men are so sinful
3035365 3039744 Oh, l don't mind that
3040703 3043081 After all, who's honest nowadays?
3043206 3044791 How awful...
3046292 3053508 Everyone wants to forget nasty things,<br />so they invent stories, it's easier
3053633 3055718 Don't be so foolish
3058972 3063560 Never mind.<br />Let's hear the dead man's story
3110815 3113901 l am in darkness now
3114527 3118531 l am suffering in the darkness
3119657 3124537 Gursed be those who cast me<br />into this hell of darkness
3162575 3165828 The bandit,<br />after aftacking my wife...
3165953 3169832 ...sat down beside her<br />and tried to console her
3171793 3176631 <i>She satthere on the Ieaves,<br />Iooking down, saying nothing</i>
3178007 3180885 <i>The bandit was cunning</i>
3182011 3186224 <i>He saidshe couldno Iongerlive<br />with herh*bandnow</i>
3186349 3190812 <i>Whynotgo with him, ratherthan<br />stayandsuffer with herh*band?</i>
3190937 3195942 <i>He saidhe hadattacked<br />onlybeca*e ofhisgreatlove forher</i>
3196067 3199237 <i>My wife Iookedathim...</i>
3199362 3202073 <i>...her*ce so* hereyes veiled</i>
3207620 3213209 <i>Neverin ourlife together<br />hadlseen herlookmore beauti*I</i>
3219757 3222301 <i>Andmybeautifulwife...</i>
3224137 3230017 <i>...whatdidshe reply to the bandi*<br />before herhelpless h*band?</i>
3233438 3239986 Take me. Take me away with you
3242363 3244657 That is what she said
3247744 3251205 But that is not all she did...
3251330 3255710 ...or else l would not now be<br />in darkness
3270683 3275438 Kill him. As long as he is alive,<br />l cannot go with you
3276814 3278649 Kill him for me!
3280151 3287408 Even now, her words cast me<br />into a pit of darkness
3292997 3300213 Have such vile, accursed words<br />ever been spoken before?
3301255 3305301 Even the bandit was shocked<br />to hear such pitiless words
3306761 3308387 Kill him!
3346843 3349929 What do you want me to do<br />with this woman?
3351389 3356310 Kill her? Spare her?<br />Nod your head to tell me
3360481 3366237 <i>Forthose words,<br />Ialmostforgave the bandit</i>
3369782 3374912 What do you want?<br />Shall l kill her? Let her go?
3403900 3407653 <i>Hours Iater...<br />Idon'tknowhowlong</i>
3450029 3453699 She got away.<br />Now she'll tell everyone
3479892 3482436 <i>It was *uiet</i>
3483896 3486649 <i>Then Iheardsomeone crying</i>
3640010 3646016 Everything was quiet.<br />How quiet it was
3647852 3650521 Darkness fell...
3652523 3656527 ...and a mist seemed to envelop me
3659196 3663868 l lay quietly in this stillness
3666787 3671458 Then someone seemed<br />to approach me. Softly, gently
3672960 3674503 Who could it be?
3674962 3678966 Then someone's hand<br />grasped the dagger...
3680718 3683679 ...and drew it out
3712875 3718672 lt's not true, there was no dagger.<br />He was killed by a sword
3757211 3759797 Now it's gefting interesting
3761757 3764969 You must have seen the whole thing
3769473 3772059 Why didn't you tell the police?
3773352 3775896 I didn't want to get involved
3776021 3778357 But now you want to talk about it?
3779525 3784405 Go on, then. Your story seems<br />to be the most interesting
3784530 3788909 l don't want to listen<br />to any more horrible stories
3790035 3792621 Such stories are commonplace now
3792746 3798752 Even the castle demons fled, because<br />they were horri*ed by what men do
3802756 3807428 How much of this story do you know?
3812224 3815853 I found a woman's hat
3815978 3817730 So you said
3820274 3824903 After l'd walked a liftle further,<br />l heard a woman crying
3826238 3832911 From behind a bush l saw her,<br />a man tied up...and Tajomaru, too
3833579 3840044 So what you said<br />about *nding the body was a lie?
3840169 3842921 I didn't want to get involved
3845382 3849386 Go on.<br />What was Tajomaru doing?
3854141 3858937 He was in front of the woman and<br />he seemed to be begging her forgiveness
3861857 3866570 Until now, if l wanted to do<br />something bad, l did it
3866695 3869281 lt was good if it was for me
3870574 3872951 But today is different
3873077 3879249 l've had you already, but l want you<br />more and more, and l suffer
3879375 3882002 Gome away with me
3886382 3889093 l'll marry you, if you like
3891929 3894139 Gome away with me
3897935 3901772 lf you like,<br />l'll even stop being a bandit
3901897 3906193 l've got money hidden away,<br />you'll live comfortably
3906318 3910447 l could work hard,<br />even sell things in the street
3910572 3913909 l'll do anything to please you...
3915244 3919248 ...if you'll come away with me
3921417 3923710 Marry me
3928382 3931301 Please say yes
3932970 3935389 lf you don't, l'll have to kill you
3939268 3943981 Don't cry.<br />Tell me you'll be my wife
3945107 3947109 Answer me!
3959288 3964001 But how could l answer?<br />How could l, a woman...
3966003 3968255 ...answer such a question?
3988525 3992279 I understand.<br />You mean that we men must decide
3995032 3996617 Wait! Wait!
3997493 4002039 I refuse to risk my life<br />for such a woman
4029399 4033195 You shameless whore!
4038992 4041036 Why don't you kill yoursel*
4044206 4048126 lf you want her, l'll give her to you
4049962 4054466 l regret losing my horse more<br />than l'll regret losing this woman
4110272 4111523 Wait!
4111648 4113108 Stay!
4125996 4130500 Save your tears. No mafter how much<br />you cry, you won't fool anyone
4132336 4135255 Don't talk like that to her,<br />it's unmanly
4136548 4139384 Women can't help crying,<br />they're naturally weak
4166078 4168330 lt's you two who are weak
4170749 4176630 lf you are my husband, kill this man,<br />then you can tell me to kill myself
4176755 4180759 But you're not a real man.<br />That is why l was crying
4182344 4184763 l'm tired of this farce
4193146 4199486 l thought that Tajomaru<br />might *nd some way out
4201321 4206868 l thought that if he would save me,<br />l would do anything for him
4207494 4214251 l wanted you to take me away,<br />l would have been yours
4219840 4223593 But he's not a man, either.<br />He's just like my husband
4224845 4230684 Remember,<br />a woman loves a real man only
4230809 4234312 She can be won only<br />by the strength of your swords!
4574444 4576821 I don't want to die!
4744405 4746783 And that's supposed to be true?
4746908 4749911 I saw it with my own eyes
4750036 4754457 -l doubt it<br />-l don't tell lies
4754582 4756751 Liars always have an answer
4756876 4761631 But if men do not tell the truth,<br />trust each other, life is a hell
4761756 4765760 -Right. Our world is a hell<br />-No, l trust men
4767762 4770515 l don't want to believe<br />this world is a hell
4770640 4773226 Shouting will make no difference
4773351 4777355 Just think, now.<br />Which of these stories do you believe?
4777480 4779190 I just don't know
4780316 4782485 They make no sense
4782610 4786948 Then don't worry about it.<br />lt's not as though men are reasonable
4849218 4851095 What are you doing?
4855016 4857060 What does it look like?
4859645 4861647 That's horrible
4862607 4867320 Why? lf l don't take these baby clothes,<br />someone else will
4868988 4870865 You are evil
4871866 4874827 Me? Then what about<br />the baby's parents?
4874952 4881209 They enjoyed making the baby,<br />then they throw it away. That's real evil
4881334 4883336 No, you're wrong
4885004 4890760 See the amulet case<br />the parents left to guard over it
4891761 4894097 Think of their suffering
4894222 4897100 Well, if you're going<br />to sympathise with others...
4897225 4898601 Sel*sh
4898726 4903731 What's wrong with that?<br />That's the way we are, the way we live
4903856 4907735 You can't live unless<br />you're what you call sel*sh
4916202 4918037 Brute!
4919414 4925461 All men are sel*sh and dishonest.<br />They all have excuses...
4926754 4931426 ...the bandit...the husband...the wife...
4933761 4935388 ...and you!
4941936 4945481 You say you don't lie. That's funny
4946315 4949902 You may have fooled the police,<br />but not me
4967378 4970756 Well, where is that dagger?
4970882 4975595 The pearl-inlaid handle<br />the bandit said was valuable
4976637 4979348 Did the earth swallow it?
4982393 4984645 Or did someone steal it?
4988107 4990359 Am l right? So it seems
4993362 4997366 Now there is a really<br />sel*sh action for you
5011506 5016719 Anything else to tell me?<br />lf not, l think l'll be going
5095256 5099051 Are you taking what liftle it has left?
5108978 5113065 I have six children of my own
5114900 5121824 One more won't make things<br />any more di*cult
5129457 5135671 l'm sorry.<br />l'm ashamed of what l said
5139133 5146682 You can't afford not to be suspicious<br />of people nowadays
5151103 5153272 lt's me who should be ashamed
5155358 5160071 l don't know why<br />l did a thing like that
5160196 5162990 No, l'm grateful to you
5176379 5180049 Because now, thanks to you...
5182093 5186430 ...l think l will be able<br />to keep my faith in mankind
5187390 5189225 l am unworthy
