382925 384426 Hello.
386261 389431 Have you closed down<br />your restaurant?
390349 391725 Yes, I'm going to London.
392017 394019 London!<br />Are you alright?
394311 397356 I'm fine.<br />I tried to reach you last night.
397648 401318 A pandemic is breaking out.<br />You shouldn't be travelling now.
401568 403403 I'm looking for a friend<br />who disappeared.
403570 405072 What are you talking about?
405364 407074 Who disappeared?
408408 411286 Are you sure you're not<br />making this up?
411495 412788 I'm late for my flight.
412996 414414 Already at the airport?
414623 416333 Boarding card, please.
416583 420796 Excuse me, it's my daughter.<br />- No problem. Your boarding card?
421630 423382 Thanks.<br />- Are you there, Kristofer?
423549 425634 I'm buying chocolate.
427136 428595 Have you heard from your doctor?
429096 430222 No, not yet.
430848 433016 So you haven't gotten<br />the MRI results?
433016 434685 Don't worry about me.
435102 437813 Shouldn't you wait<br />until you get the results?
437980 439606 I'll be in touch, dear.
439982 441066 Speak soon.

498207 499875 Thank you very much.
515682 517226 Aren't you coming?
517559 518852 We have class.
519311 521438 With that idiot Engstrom.
522564 525108 No, I have to finish this.
532699 534534 Can't it wait?<br />- No.
562354 564856 Markus.<br />- Thanks.
569069 571446 Here comes our<br />labour leader.
571863 573282 Comrade Kristofer!
574324 576118 We made it inside.
577119 579037 What do you mean?
586378 587379 To do what?
587504 590632 To get the school<br />to lift the suspensions.
590757 592092 For God's sake.
592342 595470 The Old Theater was off limits.<br />They knew it.
595804 598098 Still those idiots<br />decided to protest there.
598098 602978 The school can't tell us<br />where we can meet.
602978 604062 Exactly.
604062 608066 They can't treat us like children.<br />- You behave like ones.
619036 621330 Cheers, mate.<br />You're way too serious.
621455 624541 Cheers.<br />- Cheers.
680931 684643 I'm calling from<br />Dr. Stefansson's office.
684810 686269 Is this Kristofer?<br />- Yes.
686561 688605 You have an appointment today.<br />- Today?
688730 690774 We have the results from<br />the MRI scan.
690941 694778 I'm afraid I forgot about it.<br />I apologize.
695529 697406 I'm currently travelling.
697739 701451 It's important that you come in<br />as soon as possible.
703870 706373 I'm afraid I have to hang up.
706957 708500 Goodbye.
718176 722973 I struggle remembering<br />certain things.
723306 724850 Vague memories?
725016 728145 I often have a hard time<br />trusting my memory.
728728 729771 Often?
730605 732774 Or most of the time.
733191 735110 What about your motor skills?
735235 737737 I'm stiff in the morning
738405 740365 and throughout the day.
740699 743160 It feels like being hit by a truck.
743285 746621 In the morning?<br />- Yes.
746955 749082 I'm losing my fine motor skills.
749332 753086 Tying shoelaces, buttoning up.<br />Sending texts.
753378 755630 You're doing your exercises?<br />- Of course.
756131 759801 I recite my bank and ID number,<br />the menu from the restaurant.
760010 763180 And sometimes a haiku.<br />- Haiku?
763597 766224 Do you know what it is?<br />Japanese poetry.
766349 767809 I've heard of it.
768143 771146 The test you took doesn't<br />tell us much
771271 773440 but it gives us an indication.
773648 775317 We need to do an MRI.
776026 777736 Of your brain.
778195 780322 Revealing my secrets.
780572 782616 Anything to hide?
782741 785368 Not really.
792584 796630 In situations like yours,<br />people often use the opportunity
797881 800050 to take care of unfinished business.
800300 803762 While they still can.
804554 809935 It's just an advice, in case<br />you may have unresolved issues.
812395 814439 Dropping out because<br />of the suspensions?
814564 817192 I'm quitting because<br />the school is ruled by
817651 820695 oppressive conservatives.
833500 836419 So why don't you quit?<br />- I just said I would.
840215 842551 Look, you could join the proletariat.
843927 845470 They're hiring.
860986 862946 What an idiot.
866866 868868 Come on, Kristofer!
927177 929471 Saving the world<br />by becoming a waiter?
929596 931931 No, as a dishwasher.
991700 993326 Takahashi-san.
993451 994452 Yes?
995245 999374 A foreigner is here<br />for an interview.
1072989 1075408 Goto-san, this is the foreigner<br />who came for the interview.
1180263 1181556 Tonkatsu?
1196696 1197739 Yes.
1208499 1211794 Thank you for waiting.<br />- One beer, please.
1218760 1221346 Here, noodles are ready.<br />- Welcome!
1222680 1224265 Welcome!
1226434 1228895 Thank you.<br />Let's eat.
1229145 1232690 Meat balls ready for table 1.<br />- Yes!
1233024 1236152 Here are your meat balls.<br />Please enjoy.
1274691 1276901 It's only his first day.
1277276 1280113 Goto-san, hurry up.<br />- Coming.
1284367 1286577 We're going out for our break.<br />- Alright.
1402902 1405655 Arai-san, this is our new employee.
1406114 1407698 Krist...
1434225 1436561 Dad, stop talking about me.
1443401 1447864 Tamagoyaki, deep fried shrimp,<br />and ginger pork for table 3.
1449407 1452410 Good to see you again, Yamomoto-san.<br />Here you are.
1455037 1459458 One sake, please.<br />- Got it, one sake.
1617700 1621704 Hello, dear.<br />- I've been waiting to hear from you.
1621871 1623289 What's that noise?<br />- Sorry.
1623748 1625624 I'm at a tattoo parlour.
1626292 1628210 Why? Doing what?
1628794 1630504 Getting a tattoo.
1631213 1634175 Have you gone insane?<br />- No, why?
1634467 1636510 Your fianc√© is all inked.
1637053 1639472 His name is Axel.<br />- Axel, right.
1639764 1641807 He's tattooed from head to toe.
1642558 1646479 What has he got to do with it?<br />- I'm just teasing.
1647396 1650191 Come home while<br />there are still flights.
1651067 1652651 It's a Japanese symbol.
1652860 1657323 The borders are closing and<br />you're in London getting a tattoo!
1657990 1659992 Courage.<br />It means courage.
1660785 1662536 Call me when you're out of this noise.
1662787 1664663 Sonja!
1674382 1678219 They won't leave.<br />- What 's the rush?
1678469 1681347 My friends from school are<br />already waiting outside.
1682223 1685768 I was hoping you would<br />help me close up.
1687603 1689939 Hitomi.<br />Can you cover for me?
1690147 1692233 Again?<br />No way. I can't.
1693317 1695569 Miko, you should help out.
1702118 1703911 Kristofer is up for it.
1708165 1709500 Okay then, Miko, you can go.
1709792 1711961 But don't stay out late.<br />We have work tomorrow.
1712253 1713838 I promise.
1715840 1717508 Be careful.<br />- Yes.
1761802 1764054 Look at you!
1765389 1767308 Yes, it's a Mary Quant.
1768934 1772563 The dress is very short.<br />- You think so?
1772897 1774064 Oh, well.
1774315 1778861 Hitomi, we're not in Japan.<br />Maybe you should buy yourself one.
1780237 1783741 Me? No!
1801300 1806263 Home many times did<br />you listen to that song?
1811477 1813312 What song?
1816148 1818317 Are you learning Japanese?
1820569 1822071 I don't understand.
1837294 1839630 Nice to meet you.
1853060 1854270 Maybe.
1936644 1939146 It's better with a pinch of salt.<br />- I agree.
1947446 1949531 Misozuke.<br />This is with red soybean paste.
1962252 1964880 And a pickle with sake yeast.
1996328 1997871 Shibao dislikes
1998038 2000124 salt.
2000332 2002459 I am sweet.
2003293 2007715 Mr. Amari is a sweet person.
2026275 2028652 Do you have a girlfriend?
2040956 2043250 Miko, stop that.
2059558 2062728 Not whether you have<br />the permission from the father.
2114655 2116365 Damn it.
2318191 2321319 Good morning.<br />- Good morning.
2550507 2558431 {\an8}The sky was filled with smoke and dust.<br />Then black rain started to fall.
2570318 2574906 {\an8}First they were quarantined, considered<br />victims of a mysterious disease.
2575365 2580578 The disease was radiation sickness.
2583331 2585709 Such a big monkfish.
2586918 2588753 What's your name?
2594009 2596761 You're so funny, Takahashi.
2606938 2610567 You are really cute,<br />Mr. Monkfish.

2668958 2670377 Listen everyone.
2670752 2674297 Once I worked in a restaurant<br />where they had a haiku bowl.
2674547 2676633 Everyone wrote a haiku<br />and put it in the bowl.
2680929 2683765 I'm going to put it here.
2683973 2687519 All of you write one.<br />You too.
2702700 2704953 Thank you for coming, Naruki-San.
2705829 2707247 I'm Takahashi.
2708665 2711793 Nice to meet you.<br />- Excuse the short notice.
2711960 2713378 Please have a seat.
2772353 2773354 Hello.
2773897 2775565 I didn't know you<br />like Japanese food.
2775690 2777108 How are you?
2777400 2780195 I'm fine. How are you?<br />- Fine, fine.
2780612 2782197 I thought you had gone<br />home for the summer.
2782197 2784699 We got a job at school.<br />- Really? Doing what?
2784699 2785783 Research.
2786201 2788995 I work for Morgan.<br />Jonas for Engstrom.
2789996 2790997 Engstrom?
2791581 2795543 You always said he was an idiot.<br />What changed? -That's not true.
2795668 2799130 For God's sake, don't start<br />with that communist nonsense.
2800757 2802634 We just came to say hello.
2802800 2805553 How do you like it here?<br />- Just great.
2806721 2808264 Aren't they all Japanese?
2812477 2814521 It's a Japanese restaurant.
2814771 2815897 You know what it's called.
2816022 2817440 Kamikaze.
2824697 2826032 When are you coming back?
2826449 2829577 To school?<br />I'm not coming back.
2829744 2832830 You're not?<br />- No, of course not.
2833122 2835792 Maybe we should all become dishwashers.
2836125 2838878 Then we'd reach perfect equality.
2839921 2840964 Sure.
2841172 2843716 Well, I have to get back<br />to do your dishes.
2844634 2846135 Cheers.<br />- Good luck.
2850056 2851599 Sorry to keep you waiting.
2886342 2889887 <i>On dry land, the fish</i>
2890054 2891639 Thank you for waiting, sir.
2892098 2896102 Would you please put down the table?<br />- Yes.
2897145 2899230 Thank you.<br />- Here is your meal.
2899772 2902817 Would you like something to drink?
2903192 2906487 Red wine.<br />- Red wine it is. I'll bring it to you.
2906654 2909073 Thank you.<br />- Thank you very much.

2985358 2986359 You know,
2986984 2990613 Kristofer sings in a choir in Iceland.
3000164 3003751 Please sing.
3011008 3013511 You can do it.
3014554 3016472 Do it for me.

3245701 3246953 Here's your appetizer.<br />- Thank you.
3247119 3249622 A beer for Mr. Yamamoto.<br />- Okay.
3252041 3253668 Takahashi-san.
3255586 3259173 Hitomi.<br />It's not a dead fly.
3265388 3266931 What is it?
3294250 3300840 <i>(Sings in Italian)</i>
3301048 3304260 Arai-san, have you seen Kristofer?
3304510 3308931 <i>(Sings in Japanese)<br />He is out in the backyard.</i>
3385299 3389553 <i>Dear passengers,<br />we'll be landing in 10 minutes.</i>
3390846 3392932 <i>Please fasten your seat belts.</i>
3394058 3400940 <i>Keep your electric devices<br />turned off until landing.</i>
3410616 3413786 We've yet to talk about<br />Sonja, your daughter.
3414662 3416247 How old was she when<br />you started dating?
3416413 3418374 Wasn't she...<br />- She was turning seven.
3418666 3419750 Seven.
3420084 3421710 How did she respond to you?
3422002 3424255 Just fine.<br />- Really well.
3424547 3426257 Does she call you 'Dad'?
3426799 3428384 Usually she does.
3428843 3431345 But 'Kristofer' if I upset her.
3431887 3436350 That rarely happens.<br />He overindulges her.
3437101 3438435 How so?
3439353 3443149 Well, I'm the one who ends up<br />setting her boundaries.
3444733 3447278 Did you ever discuss<br />having children of your own?
3450781 3455286 Inga thought it might be<br />too much for Sonja at first.
3456745 3458873 Then time passed and...
3463919 3466797 So you chose to postpone<br />having more children?
3469175 3470176 Yes.
3470718 3472428 Was that the reason?
3475764 3476765 No.
3537910 3539495 "TO KRISTOFER-SAN."
3540329 3542456 "A GENTLE SOUL."
3591338 3592339 Welcome.
