579713 580948 English, please.
580981 582883 The old building--<br />some of us got in.
582917 584718 They locked me and Markús out,
584752 586887 but, uh,<br />there's enough people inside.
607675 609009 What? What?
609043 610978 There were plenty<br />of other places to meet,
611011 612980 but they chose<br />the Old Theater...
613013 614815 -Don't listen to him. -...just<br />because they were told not to.
614849 616817 So you're with the<br />administration on this one?
616851 617985 -"With the administration."<br />-Come on.
618018 619720 He's just pulling your leg.

639173 641008 Yes.
641041 644445 I should warn you that<br />there is talk of a lockdown
644478 646013 as early as tomorrow,
646046 649016 which would require us<br />to close down the hotel.
649049 650284 That's too bad.
650317 652153 I plan to stay.
652186 653754 Well, on the plus side,
653787 655956 you're staying for<br />half the price, aren't you?
657158 659293 Of course. Thank you.

789390 791191 Kristofer.
821221 822956 I'm wondering<br />if we're dealing with
822990 825292 the remaking<br />of socialist politics
825326 828195 or the remaking<br />of Kristofer Hannesson.
828228 830964 Jónas, do you think<br />supply and demand curves
830998 832466 are gonna help us<br />make a difference?
832499 834101 Mm, yes.
837137 839006 -Is he really gonna quit?<br />-I don't know, man.
839039 840941 He's been talking about it<br />for a while.

1878278 1881382 The last time I knew<br />was in Croydon, South London.
1881415 1883484 Uh, Addiscombe Grove.
1884686 1888355 But that's some time ago.<br />50 years.
1888389 1889657 50 years?
1889691 1892259 To be more exact, 51.
1892292 1893528 Mr. Hannesson...
1896397 1898499 If I may be so bold,
1898533 1901301 you are the last guest left.
1901335 1904004 We have to close the hotel<br />as soon as possible.
1904037 1905339 You may want to go back
1905372 1908008 while there are still flights<br />to Iceland.
1908041 1909209 I'm not going back.
1909243 1911145 Well, there is<br />no Hitomi Nakamura
1911178 1912379 living in Croydon<br />that I can see.
1912413 1915149 -There-there...<br />-Let me be more exact.
1915182 1918018 Last time I checked it<br />20 years ago, she had moved.
1918051 1920421 So you-you looked for her<br />20 years ago,
1920454 1923290 -but you-you couldn't find her<br />then? -Yeah.
1923323 1924559 Let me explain.
1924592 1925660 Okay.
1927060 1929430 Please do.
1933233 1935537 -Mmm.<br />-Mmm.
1935570 1937204 -You try.<br />-Mmm.
1939774 1943277 -Mmm. Really good.<br />-Need more time in jar.
1943310 1944344 Mm.
1944378 1945713 This is basic.
1945747 1948048 Many type of pickles.
1950384 1952186 Only red miso.
1952219 1954188 -Misozuke. Misozuke.<br />-Misozuke. -On to, uh...
1954221 1956724 -shoyuzuke.<br />-Pickle with soy sauce.
1956758 1958192 What did you say it was called?
1958225 1960194 -Shoyuzuke.<br />-Mm. -Shoyuzuke.
1960227 1962564 -Shoyuzuke.<br />-Shoyuzuke.
1962597 1965667 Kasuzuke. Kasuzuke.
1965700 1967501 Pickle with, uh, uh, sake yeast.
1967535 1969136 Mm.
2029564 2031198 "Garfrendo"?
2031231 2033535 Do you have a girlfriend?
2033568 2035269 No.
2035302 2038405 Did you ever have a girlfriend?
2038438 2039741 Yes.
2039774 2041441 Did you talk a lot<br />with her father?
2044278 2045713 I... didn't know her father.
2045747 2049517 So you never talked about your<br />relationship with his daughter?
2051251 2051819 No.
2051853 2054154 It, uh, wasn't serious.
2054187 2056624 We didn't have any expectations.
2057257 2059527 So that's what makes<br />a relationship serious?
2068135 2070137 I'm sorry, Kristofer-san.
2070170 2072105 Could you give us privacy?
2188923 2192660 "A calm sea but waves

2214549 2216216 Hello?
2216884 2218853 You found her?
2218886 2219954 That's...
2219987 2221956 that's great to hear.
2221989 2223624 I'll be right with you.
2224826 2226493 Thank you so much.
2227494 2228596 Mm.
2232900 2234902 Thank you so much. Thank you.
2234936 2236904 Goodbye. Goodbye.
2237638 2240440 The electoral register.<br />That's where we found her.
2240474 2242275 Oh, my God.
2242309 2245813 I have a friend<br />at the British Library.
2245847 2247347 Thank you so much.
2247380 2249851 Now, I have to ask you<br />to check out
2249884 2251351 no later than this afternoon,
2251384 2253621 as we are closing down<br />the hotel.
2253654 2255322 No problem.
2256057 2257558 Of course.
2261394 2262663 <i>Kristofer-san...</i>
2263531 2265465 ...you like cherry blossom?
2266067 2267835 Um, yeah.
2267869 2270037 Very fragrant. You smell.
2273373 2274909 They are plastic!
2276878 2278780 Oh, very funny, Hitomi.
2286821 2288421 Thank you, sir.
2302703 2303671 There she is.
2308843 2311579 Hitomi, you have a guest.
2313614 2314949 A guest?
2314982 2316717 Who is it?
2322056 2323991 Hitomi, can't you remember me?
2324025 2325726 I am Kristofer.
2326561 2328428 Kristofer-san?
2328461 2330698 Please.<br />Please keep your distance.
2330731 2332465 No touching.
2332499 2335736 -You old now.<br />-You haven't changed at all.
2336938 2338539 You now older than me.
2338573 2340373 Are you still a communist?
2340407 2342109 I was always more<br />of an anarchist.
2342143 2344846 Now I'm just old.
2344879 2347748 You still very funny,<br />Kristofer-san.
2348883 2350417 Come. This way.
2350852 2354722 Goto-san, Takahashi-san<br />in the kitchen.
2354755 2357558 Such a strange kitchen.<br />You remember?
2357592 2358960 Yeah, I remember.
2358993 2360528 An old bakery.
2360561 2362395 Mm-hmm.
2362429 2365633 Oh, and here just Takahashi-san.
2366167 2367935 Where is this taken?
2367969 2369604 Mm.
2369637 2372840 Oh, in Japan,<br />after they moved back.
2372874 2374742 So they moved back home?
2374775 2379680 Yes. Takahashi-san contact me<br />many years later.
2381883 2383651 But what about Miko?
2384185 2387121 Miko, she only contact me
2387154 2391092 when, uh,<br />Takahashi-san die in 2004.
2391125 2393493 Where in Japan was she living?
2394028 2395863 I don't know.
2397565 2400001 But I think<br />I might have a letter.
2400034 2402737 Let me have a look.
2407141 2409010 It should be in here.
2409043 2410678 Yeah.
2417852 2420054 Here.
2420087 2421689 Huh.
2421722 2424659 -And it has a return address.<br />-Yeah, yeah.
2424692 2427128 So they moved back<br />where they came from.
2427161 2428829 Yes.
2429797 2433534 That was the only time<br />I hear from Miko.
2433567 2434835 Yeah.
2469603 2471872 It's like we never left.
2474175 2476210 He's still stuck there.
2476243 2478879 In Tokyo?
2480181 2482482 No.
2490858 2492693 Hiroshima.
2516917 2519320 Hey, Barry. Did you find<br />anything in Japanese?
2519353 2520654 -Yeah.<br />-Great.
2520688 2523090 This is the only thing I found,
2523124 2526027 but it should give you<br />an insight into the aftermath
2526060 2527895 from their perspective.
2527928 2530264 -Okay. Perfect. Thank you.<br />-It's good to see you again.
2530297 2531899 You, too, Barry.<br />Have a good day.
2589657 2591659 "Uh, I don't understand.
2591692 2593227 Don't you speak English?"
2597898 2598666 Hello.
2598699 2601102 Oh, Kristofer-san.
2601135 2604705 -I'm a so beautiful monkfish.<br />-Fish.
2604738 2606607 Don't you think?
2611278 2613681 Oh!
2613714 2615649 -Oh. Kristofer-san.<br />-Uh-huh?
2615683 2617384 You know haiku?
2617418 2618853 Yeah, I've heard of it.
2618886 2620855 -Uh, Japanese poem.<br />-Mm-hmm.
2620888 2622156 -Only three lines.<br />-Mm-hmm.
2622189 2623390 Very, very simple.
2623424 2625359 Very, very difficult.
2625392 2628362 -I wrote a haiku about a fish.<br />-Uh-huh.
2628395 2629997 This one in Japanese.
2630030 2631232 You read.
2631265 2633000 Oh...
2633033 2633868 No, I can't. I...
2633901 2635136 I just started learning,<br />Takahashi-san.
2635169 2637037 Try. I'll help.
2637071 2638139 I'll help.
2638172 2639273 Try.

2640908 2642643 -This is...<br />-Mm.
2648849 2650951 "Iwana." Iwana is a fish.
2657291 2658392 Thank you.
2658425 2660261 This is a haiku.
2660294 2661896 Hai. Uh, sometimes,
2661929 2666267 uh, there is<br />a personal confession in haiku.
2666300 2667968 -Interesting. Mm?<br />-Really?
2668002 2668969 So...
2677211 2679246 Takahashi-san wants us<br />to write haiku
2679280 2680247 and put it in the bowl.
2680281 2681715 No. No, no.

3219620 3222990 Would it be okay if I came here<br />in the morning
3223024 3224859 to practice cooking?
3224892 3227862 I'd-I'd clean up after myself<br />and pay for whatever I used.
3227895 3229030 No.
3229063 3231331 -You don't pay.<br />-Mm.
3231364 3232734 What do you want to cook?
3232767 3235002 I'd just like to see<br />if I can make the, you know,
3235036 3237705 the traditional breakfast<br />myself.
3237739 3239640 I-If that's okay.

3330731 3333568 Uh, no, no.
3333601 3336637 Well, I-I just want to see<br />if I can make the...
3336671 3339574 you know, the traditional<br />breakfast properly.
3339607 3343410 And who's going to be<br />the judge of that?
3344145 3346479 Me, I guess.
3348983 3351351 Do you want me to come?
3352019 3353754 Yes.
3354155 3356157 But you can't be<br />too tough on me, though.

3651485 3655689 I read, listen to music,
3655723 3657791 try to study Japanese.
3657825 3660094 Well, sounds like<br />you're doing really well.
3660127 3661862 Thank you.
3668202 3670304 Mm.

3682517 3685319 Hiroshima...
3685352 3686921 There's nothing left.
3686954 3690925 We left a long time ago,<br />and we're not going back.
3690958 3693794 -I'm sorry.<br />-It's okay.
3695829 3699099 I put, um, clams in the soup.
3700935 3704805 Cherrystones from, uh, Essex.
3706907 3709476 I'm sorry.<br />I can't sit like this.
3709511 3713013 My knees aren't Japanese.
3722489 3724491 What was your girlfriend's name?
3724526 3726460 Uh, Hildur.
3727094 3730030 -Does she live in Iceland?<br />-Mm-hmm.
3731398 3733834 Did you sleep with her?
3735002 3736437 Yes.
3736470 3738305 How was it?
3738339 3740174 Excuse me?
3740207 3742343 Was it good?
3742376 3744011 Yes.
3747348 3750985 But it wasn't serious?
3751018 3752119 No.
3753287 3755155 So you didn't love her?
3761362 3763063 I was fond of her.
3768168 3769937 So, um...
3771905 3775843 ...why did you<br />come here to work?
3777444 3780047 Because of you.
3784318 3786153 Um...
3787421 3789890 When we met?
3797532 3800301 When you were leaving...
3800334 3801603 Mm-hmm.
3801636 3804271 ...and I was coming in.
3810944 3813981 I told Dad not to hire you.
3816551 3818553 You told him not to hire me?
3818586 3820321 Mm-hmm.
3820354 3822089 Why?

4129396 4131465 Oh, yes. And what's even worse,
4131498 4134167 I forget to tell her<br />about me going to Japan.
4134201 4135770 Oh.
4135803 4138338 Not good, eh?
4138372 4141809 -I know. I know.<br />-Kristofer-san...
4141843 4143611 not good.
4179614 4181716 He's everywhere.
4181749 4183283 Who?
4183851 4185485 Jesus.
4190958 4195563 Mrs. Ellis is really religious.
4195596 4198398 She screwed and stuck it<br />to the wall.
4201368 4205205 Is he supposed to keep<br />an eye on you?
4207274 4208910 Well, I hope not.
4208943 4210812 I'm gonna be in big trouble.
4221354 4224224 I can't stand it.
4233835 4237739 I felt like he looked at me<br />differently when I left.
4237772 4239507 Takahashi-san.
4241374 4243845 That's just your imagination.
4243878 4246346 Why can't he know about us?
4247982 4252653 I mean, why does he have<br />to know about us?
4254522 4257357 So we can stop sneaking around.
4259761 4262362 I don't get it.
4262395 4264732 Thought you said he liked me.
4264766 4267300 He does like you.
4270337 4272673 I just don't understand.
4285920 4289389 What is it<br />that you don't understand?
4301903 4304572 -Kristofer.<br />-Morning.
4304605 4309110 Your friend, the young lady,<br />where is she from?
4309143 4310912 She's from here.
4310945 4313714 And before that?
4313748 4315049 Japan.
4315082 4318451 Mm. Be careful.
4327128 4329797 Uh, basic sake.
4329831 4331732 And, uh...
4335736 4337505 Very premium.
4337538 4340373 -Strong.<br />-Strong.
4348850 4350718 Why did you come here?
4350751 4353754 I always dreamt of<br />visiting Japan.
4353788 4354989 Mm-hmm.
4355022 4357625 Ooh. Here.
4361062 4362663 Oh, sounds good.
4370171 4373741 -Very good.<br />-Good.
4376143 4378746 I marry in 1970.
4380081 4382884 When my wife died,
4382917 4385485 I feel very lonely.
4389056 4391826 40 years married.
4391859 4393694 40 years.
4395529 4399967 You ever hear<br />the Japanese word "kodokushi"?
4400001 4401501 No.
4401535 4403638 My Japanese is not that good.
4403671 4408509 It means "fear of dying alone."
4410578 4413714 You even have a special word<br />for that.
4419086 4420821 Kristofer-san.
4448816 4449717 Don't worry.
4449750 4453220 Dad won't be home<br />until after midnight.
4453254 4454889 He never is.
4454922 4458826 And what about the neighbors?<br />They might see us.
4458859 4463030 Well, they don't care for us,<br />and we don't talk to them.
4463064 4465566 Dad likes it that way.
4489290 4491491 That's me.
4493260 4494962 Come.
4528329 4532533 My mum painted them.
4535703 4539740 Dad and Mum lived in Hiroshima.
4539774 4544645 And... Grandma and Grandpa<br />were visiting that day.
4546380 4548049 It was the summer holidays,
4548082 4553587 so Dad and a few others<br />were repairing a school roof...
4553621 4556957 just outside Hiroshima<br />when the bomb fell.
4558692 4561896 Mum was six months pregnant.
4562296 4567234 I don't know how Dad managed<br />to find the ruins of the house.
4567268 4570871 He says he has no memory of it.
4574075 4577678 Only of the burned earth
4577711 4579847 and the black rain...
4581348 4584185 ...and the river
4584218 4586887 filled with floating corpses.
4589390 4591692 When Dad found Mum,
4591725 4595729 she herself was badly burned.
4601869 4606707 She gave birth to me<br />a month prematurely.
4614782 4619887 And she died a year later.
4628429 4631932 So I'm still a hibakusha.
4647181 4648449 -Hitomi.<br />-Yes?
4648482 4650217 Can I ask you something?
4650251 4651852 Of course.
4651886 4654755 This word, "hibakusha,"<br />uh, what does it mean?
4654788 4657391 Where did you hear that word?
4657424 4659860 I just saw it somewhere.
4659894 4661862 You should learn<br />different Japanese words.
4661896 4664732 Uh, can't you just tell me<br />what it means?
4668369 4671672 It means "atomic bomb survivor."
4675510 4678345 And what if you can't find her?
4678379 4680781 It's been a long time.
4681982 4685186 Yeah. You know something?
4685219 4686987 Lots of Japanese people,
4687021 4689089 they travel<br />all the way to Iceland
4689123 4692059 in hope of seeing<br />the northern lights.
4693093 4696964 But knowing that<br />they might not, they still go.
4697765 4699767 -Eh.<br />-I understand...
4699800 4701468 -Yeah.<br />-...Kristofer-san.
4701502 4704471 Life very short.
4704506 4706974 Always good to sing.
4747181 4748215 Everybody!
4802303 4803871 What?
4805372 4807107 I love you.
5059527 5063297 What are you<br />going to do for the holiday?
5063330 5066366 Yamamoto-san complains<br />that we close for the holiday.
5066400 5069336 I said, "One week,<br />Yamamoto-san. Only one week.
5069369 5072139 You eat somewhere else<br />for one week."
5072172 5075142 He said, "No, eight days.
5075175 5078312 You close for eight days."
5078345 5079847 So, what are you going to do?
5079881 5083450 Uh... don't know.
5083483 5084586 -No?<br />-No.
5084619 5086521 Uh, don't have anything planned.
5086554 5089189 Oh. Oh...
5099701 5102369 Takahashi-san never go anywhere.
5108910 5110778 Make sure to lock up.
5110812 5112513 Yeah. Of course.
5153554 5154889 -Hi.<br />-Hi.
5154922 5157257 I didn't expect<br />to see you tonight.
5157859 5160260 Is everything okay?
5167401 5170805 Um, I have something for you.
5170838 5172807 For me?
5172840 5174942 It's fragile.
5174976 5177177 Thank you.
5178680 5180548 It was my mum's cup.
5180581 5182282 She made it.
5182917 5184686 Fujisan.
5184719 5187387 Fujisan. It's beautiful.
5187421 5190792 Are there Japanese people<br />in Iceland?
5190825 5193393 Um, not that I know of.
5193995 5196296 Any Asian people?
5196329 5198833 Probably at the embassies or...
5198866 5200568 That's it?
5200601 5202302 Yeah.
5202335 5204572 Wh-What's going on, Miko?
5205606 5207508 Can you tell me<br />what you're thinking?
5303436 5304705 Miko?
5403004 5404772 Did they fire you?
5404805 5407775 Uh, no, we're closed<br />for vacation.
5407808 5409176 Oh.
5409210 5410645 Until tomorrow.
5410678 5412647 I go back to work tomorrow.
5412680 5415116 Someone brought this in<br />yesterday.
5415149 5417484 Said it was for you.
5421055 5422455 Who?
5422489 5424692 A Oriental gentleman.
5438105 5440574 Kristofer-san.
5440608 5443476 What's going on? What happened?
5443511 5446180 Takahashi-san<br />closed down Nippon.
5446213 5447715 He closed it down? When?
5447748 5451218 Tuesday.<br />I-It happened very fast.
5451252 5453754 He asked me<br />to take care of the fish.
5453788 5455823 Where's Miko?
5455856 5459226 I don't see Miko, but I think<br />she leave with Takahashi-san.
5459260 5461262 Leave? Leave where?
5461295 5464231 Takahashi-san don't say.
5473708 5474909 -Okay.<br />-Can you take that side?
5474942 5477011 -Is that too heavy?<br />-No, it's fine.
5477044 5478512 Take it carefully.
5478546 5480548 Uh, excuse me. What's going on?
5480581 5481682 Where's the family<br />that lives here?
5481716 5483951 They've gone. We're moving in.
5592426 5595763 Excuse me. Excuse me.
5595796 5598232 I'm sorry if I startled you.
5598265 5600701 Do you speak English?
5687955 5691292 Ah. Uh...
5802970 5805205 Is that really you?
5808342 5810077 Yes.
5813981 5816116 I hope you had a good life.
5822624 5825025 Nothing to complain about.
5829631 5833233 Miko, shouldn't you be resting?
5833267 5835502 I can come some other day<br />if you like.
5835537 5837471 No. The doctors say
5837504 5840307 I'm no longer contagious, but...
5840341 5842242 I don't know.
5847448 5849083 I...
5849116 5851218 I brought you some flowers.
5851251 5853354 They...
5853387 5855856 they might need water.
5873608 5875275 Miko?
5876477 5878278 Yes.
5890592 5892960 Kristofer.
5894194 5896029 Miko.
5899634 5902102 Forgive me.
5903504 5905906 You don't need to...
5917585 5919319 Oh. Forgive me.
5922055 5924391 Mm.
5948015 5950217 Forgive me.
5964632 5965733 Mm.
5991358 5992392 Oh.
5994261 5996363 I'm not going anywhere.
6020655 6023323 Mm. But you needed the rest.
6025125 6027127 You want some tea?
6027695 6030130 Green tea?
6040407 6043310 Mm.
6055657 6058492 I looked you up later.
6058526 6059761 Much later.
6059794 6062062 You did?
6063765 6065733 I found you.
6065767 6068201 You were married.
6069571 6072272 You must have hated me.
6072840 6075108 Never.
6075142 6078378 But I was angry<br />for a long, long time.
6080682 6082482 I'm sorry.
6088355 6090190 Ah.
6090892 6094194 It's nice to get some fresh air.
6096831 6099099 You still smoke?
6100668 6102135 Is that a problem?
6102169 6104371 Reminds me on our first talk.
6105472 6106841 Oh.
6106874 6108610 In the backyard at Nippon.
6108643 6110243 Exactly.
6111378 6114882 I've pictured us there<br />so many times,
6114916 6118418 but more in my room.
6119486 6121488 We're alone,
6121522 6124859 and you start<br />asking about my father.
6126527 6128195 I was so scared of him,<br />that he might come home.
6137905 6141809 Hashimoto-san told me
6141843 6144444 that you worked with children.
6145613 6147314 Children.
6148448 6152219 They became my passion,<br />you know?
6153955 6156423 I never married.
6162730 6165499 Do you remember the word...
6165533 6166901 "hibakusha"?
6166934 6168903 Yes, of course.
6168936 6171438 Atomic bomb survivor.
6171471 6173240 Yes.
6173808 6176343 Well, I was 11
6176376 6179279 when Dad first told me<br />what happened to Mum.
6180247 6182884 About the bombing of Hiroshima.
6183584 6187320 Until then, I only knew that<br />we had lived here in Hiroshima
6187354 6189724 before we moved to Tokyo.
6189757 6191526 But now...
6191559 6195195 he felt he had no choice<br />but to tell me.
6195630 6199466 That was the first time<br />I heard the word "hibakusha."
6200635 6202904 There was a lot<br />of discrimination.
6202937 6206306 There still is, in some way.
6206339 6210310 People thought<br />it was hereditary.
6212013 6215215 Some people thought<br />it was contagious.
6217484 6219721 Dad wanted<br />to get away from it all,
6219754 6222222 so we moved to London.
6223558 6227028 You know, at first,<br />his rules and prohibitions
6227061 6229530 -didn't affect me.<br />-Hmm.
6230898 6234702 But then I hit puberty.
6283350 6285418 Do you remember when Naruki
6285452 6287387 came to the restaurant?
6288388 6292392 That's when Dad told him<br />I was a hibakusha.
6293795 6295563 That was enough.
6296964 6299066 But I didn't care.
6299100 6301301 I had met you.
6302570 6306507 And then something changed,<br />didn't it?
6309944 6311712 Yes.
6312580 6315016 I thought I found the answer.
6315049 6318786 Persuading Dad wasn't easy,
6318820 6321823 but he agreed.
6321856 6324025 Of two evils,
6324058 6327562 sterilization was better
6327595 6330631 than having to trust me<br />to keep my promise.
6330665 6332432 Sterilization?
6333067 6335402 I thought that was the only way.
6420721 6424759 Dad didn't ask<br />who the father was.
6424792 6426527 The father?
6429230 6431532 I told him.
6434568 6436804 He was so fond of you.
6436837 6439707 I thought it would help,<br />but it didn't.
6441876 6444145 I was gonna tell you<br />about my pregnancy,
6444178 6447615 but I lost my courage.
6447648 6451652 To Dad, I had committed<br />the crime he most feared.
6452853 6455856 He was convinced<br />the baby was disabled.
6457191 6459560 I started believing it, too.
6461529 6464464 He ordered me to stay at home.
6465266 6466834 He closed Nippon,
6466867 6469570 paid the staff,<br />booked our flights,
6469603 6471973 all in a matter of days.
6472006 6473774 Said goodbye to no one.
6475876 6480581 We moved to Takehara,<br />village east of here.
6482116 6484885 <i>This was where his roots were.</i>
6485753 6487955 <i>Where he had buried my mother.</i>
6489290 6491625 <i>After everything,</i>
6491659 6493894 <i>after more than 20 years away...</i>
6496230 6499300 <i>...after he had escaped,</i>
6499333 6501702 <i>he came back.</i>
6538706 6540941 <i>His name is Akira.</i>
6542109 6544945 Your son's name is Akira.
6546347 6549183 He looks like you.
6549216 6551152 We were very lucky.
6551185 6553320 He was adopted by good people.
6553354 6556023 The husband is Australian,
6556057 6557958 the wife Japanese.
6559026 6561796 Mm. Akira.
6561829 6564799 -You said the name was Akira.<br />-Yes.
6564832 6567668 I love the sound of it.
6579080 6580981 Guess what he does.
