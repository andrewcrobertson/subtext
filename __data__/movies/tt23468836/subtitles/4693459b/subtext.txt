382925 384217 Hello.
384218 386260 Kristofer. Hi.
386261 389431 Have you closed down<br />your restaurant?
390349 391725 Yes, I'm going to London.
392017 394019 London!<br />Are you alright?
394311 397356 I'm fine.<br />I tried to reach you last night.
397648 401318 A pandemic is breaking out.<br />You shouldn't be travelling now.
401568 403403 I'm looking for a friend<br />who disappeared.
403570 405072 What are you talking about?
405364 407074 Who disappeared?
408408 411286 Are you sure you're not<br />making this up?
411495 412788 I'm late for my flight.
412996 414414 Already at the airport?
414623 416333 Boarding card, please.
416583 420796 Excuse me, it's my daughter.<br />- No problem. Your boarding card?
421630 423382 Thanks.<br />- Are you there, Kristofer?
423549 425634 I'm buying chocolate.
427136 428595 Have you heard from your doctor?
429096 430222 No, not yet.
430848 433015 So you haven't gotten<br />the MRI results?
433016 434685 Don't worry about me.
435102 437813 Shouldn't you wait<br />until you get the results?
437980 439606 I'll be in touch, dear.
439982 441066 Speak soon.
442651 443902 Thank you.

514648 515681 Kristofer.
515682 517226 Aren't you coming?
517559 518852 We have class.
519311 521438 With that idiot Engstrom.
522564 525108 No, I have to finish this.
526761 529630 <i>The Remaking<br />of Socialist Politics.</i>
529663 531732 - "The whole of..."<br />- Shh.
532699 534534 Can't it wait?<br />- No.
535069 537104 <i>Engstrom out, out, out, out!</i>
537138 539607 Hear us, LSE!
539640 541642 - No gates! No police!<br />- Leave!

543210 544645 Out, out, out!
544678 546614 This is not going<br />to help your cause!
546647 548182 No gates! No police!
548215 551652 Their suspensions will not<br />be lifted if this continues.
551685 553921 - Is that a threat?<br />- Leave! Just leave!
553954 555256 Engstrom out! Engstrom out!

567201 569068 Excuse me. Hi.
569069 571446 Here comes our labour leader.
571863 573282 Comrade Kristofer!
574324 576118 We made it inside.
577119 579037 What do you mean?
579713 580948 English, please.
580981 582883 The old building...<br />some of us got in.
582917 584718 They locked me and Markús out,
584752 586887 but, uh,<br />there's enough people inside.
586378 587379 To do what?
587504 590632 To get the school<br />to lift the suspensions.
590757 592092 For God's sake.
592342 595470 The Old Theater was off limits.<br />They knew it.
595804 598097 Still those idiots<br />decided to protest there.
598098 602977 The school can't tell us<br />where we can meet.
602978 604061 Exactly.
604062 607871 They can't treat us like children.<br />- You behave like ones.
607872 609009 What? What?
609043 610978 There were plenty<br />of other places to meet,
611011 612980 but they chose<br />the Old Theater...
613013 614825 - Don't listen to him.<br />- Just because they were told not to.
614849 616817 So you're with the<br />administration on this one?
616851 617994 - "With the administration."<br />- Come on.
618018 619378 He's just pulling your leg.
619379 621330 Cheers, mate.<br />You're way too serious.
621455 624541 Cheers.<br />- Cheers.
633434 635903 - Afternoon, sir.<br />- Good afternoon, sir.
637705 639140 My name is Kristofer Hannesson.
639173 641008 Yes.
641041 644445 I should warn you that<br />there is talk of a lockdown
644478 646013 as early as tomorrow,
646046 649016 which would require us<br />to close down the hotel.
649049 650284 That's too bad.
650317 652153 I plan to stay.
652186 653754 Well, on the plus side,
653787 655956 you're staying for<br />half the price, aren't you?
657158 659293 Of course. Thank you.
680214 681323 Hello.
681324 684643 I'm calling from<br />Dr. Stefansson's office.
684810 686269 Is this Kristofer?<br />- Yes.
685286 686560 Shh.
686561 688605 You have an appointment today.<br />- Today?
688730 690774 We have the results from<br />the MRI scan.
690941 694778 I'm afraid I forgot about it.<br />I apologize.
695529 697406 I'm currently travelling.
697739 701451 It's important that you come in<br />as soon as possible.
698165 700334 Excuse me, sir.
700367 703869 Talking on the phone is not<br />allowed in the dining room.
703870 706373 I'm afraid I have to hang up.
706957 708500 Goodbye.
718176 722973 I struggle remembering<br />certain things.
723306 724850 Vague memories?
725016 728145 I often have a hard time<br />trusting my memory.
728728 729771 Often?
730605 732774 Or most of the time.
733191 735110 What about your motor skills?
735235 737737 I'm stiff in the morning
738405 740365 and throughout the day.
740699 743160 It feels like being hit by a truck.
743285 746621 In the morning?<br />- Yes.
746955 749082 I'm losing my fine motor skills.
749332 753086 Tying shoelaces, buttoning up.<br />Sending texts.
753378 755630 You're doing your exercises?<br />- Of course.
756131 759801 I recite my bank and ID number,<br />the menu from the restaurant.
760010 763180 And sometimes a haiku.<br />- Haiku?
763597 766224 Do you know what it is?<br />Japanese poetry.
766349 767809 I've heard of it.
768143 771146 The test you took doesn't<br />tell us much
771271 773440 but it gives us an indication.
773648 775317 We need to do an MRI.
776026 777736 Of your brain.
778195 780322 Revealing my secrets.
780572 782616 Anything to hide?
782741 785368 Not really.
789390 791191 Kristofer.
792584 796630 In situations like yours,<br />people often use the opportunity
797881 800050 to take care of unfinished business.
800300 803762 While they still can.
804554 809935 It's just an advice, in case<br />you may have unresolved issues.
812395 814439 Dropping out because<br />of the suspensions?
814564 817192 I'm quitting because<br />the school is ruled by
817651 820695 oppressive conservatives.
821221 822956 I'm wondering<br />if we're dealing with
822990 825292 the remaking<br />of socialist politics
825326 828195 or the remaking<br />of Kristofer Hannesson.
828228 830964 Jónas, do you think<br />supply and demand curves
830998 832466 are gonna help us<br />make a difference?
832499 833499 Mm, yes.
833500 836419 So why don't you quit?<br />- I just said I would.
837137 839006 - Is he really gonna quit?<br />- I don't know, man.
839039 840941 He's been talking about it<br />for a while.
840215 842551 Look, you could join the proletariat.
843243 844311 "Staff wanted."
844312 845470 They're hiring.
846113 849149 Hey, Kristofer wants<br />to join the proletariat.
850484 852920 Go on. Get a job with the Japs.
854455 856390 Okay.
856423 857659 Hey, Kristofer.
860986 862946 What an idiot.
864398 865533 Hello?
866866 868868 Come on, Kristofer!
872272 874441 - What an idiot.<br />- Hi.
874475 876310 We open at 6:00.
876343 881148 Oh, no. Uh, I was just actually<br />here for the job vacancy.
881181 882082 Huh?
882116 885919 The j... There's a sign<br />outside your door.
885953 888956 You want to wash dishes?
888989 891992 Yeah.<br />I mean, if that's what it is.
892025 896196 You come tomorrow morning<br />at 10:00 for interview.
898232 899634 Thank you.
899667 902069 Sorry.
902102 903303 Oh.
906608 909677 Um...
909711 912112 - Uh, sorry. Yeah.<br />- Excuse me.
920487 923525 So, how did it go?<br />Did you get the job?
923558 926460 Come on. You're not serious<br />about this, are you?
926493 927569 Yes, I am.
927570 929471 Saving the world<br />by becoming a waiter?
929596 931931 No, as a dishwasher.
932700 935035 That's going to make<br />a difference.
972707 974441 Hi.
978378 980548 - I'm sorry. I thought, um...<br />- Uh, we don't open
980582 982149 till lunchtime.
982182 984519 No, I'm-I'm actually here<br />for the job interview.
984552 986588 - Interview?<br />- Yeah.
986621 989122 Oh. Uh, o-okay.
989156 991980 - Uh, you wait there, please.<br />- Okay. Thank you.
991981 993326 Takahashi-san.
993451 994452 Yes?
995245 999374 A foreigner is here<br />for an interview.
1003571 1006006 - Please.<br />- Thank you.
1008175 1011278 So, where do you work?<br />What restaurant?
1011311 1015115 Uh, I've never worked<br />in a restaurant before.
1015148 1017150 So, what do you do?
1017184 1019821 I am, uh, currently a student,
1019854 1022657 uh, at London School<br />of Economics.
1022690 1024258 This is not part-time job.
1024291 1027127 I'm not looking<br />for a part-time job.
1027160 1029697 You want to quit studying? Why?
1029731 1033601 It's just, um, I lost interest.
1033635 1036236 Great school. Very respected.
1037639 1039139 You know how to cook?
1039172 1041609 Even dishwasher<br />need to know something.
1041643 1045445 Uh, yeah. Well, I know<br />how to boil cod and potatoes.
1045479 1049684 I used to work on, uh,<br />fishing boats in the summer.
1049717 1051619 - Fishing boats?<br />- Yeah.
1051653 1053621 You worked on fishing boats?
1053655 1056456 Yeah, back home, uh, in Iceland.
1056490 1058826 Huh. Iceland?
1058860 1060494 - Yeah.<br />- Iceland.
1060528 1062697 - Volcanoes like Japan?<br />- Yeah. Exactly.
1062730 1064231 Oh.
1064264 1067200 - Come with me.<br />- Yeah.
1067234 1069571 This used to be a bakery.
1069604 1070838 Really?
1070872 1072988 Big space, cheap rent.
1072989 1075408 Goto-san, this is the foreigner<br />who came for the interview.
1073206 1075375 - Hello. Hi.<br />- Hi.
1076476 1078078 Hi.
1090324 1093160 What do you fish in Iceland?
1093193 1095697 - Um, mostly flatfish.<br />- Huh?
1095730 1097164 - Like, uh, halibut.<br />- Ah.
1097197 1099199 And sometimes<br />we also got monkfish.
1099232 1100835 - Monkfish?<br />- Yeah, monkfish.
1100868 1102336 - Oh.<br />- But, uh, no one wants it.
1102369 1104872 - Oh, pity.<br />- Huh?
1104906 1106273 Good fish, monkfish.
1106306 1109242 - But so ugly.<br />- Oh, but tasty.
1111512 1113413 Iceland. Iceland.
1113447 1115583 - Uh, here. That's it.<br />- Oh.
1115617 1117150 Oh.
1117184 1119353 I used to live here<br />in, uh, Snæfellsnes.
1119386 1121355 - Huh?<br />- Snæfellsnes.
1121388 1122757 Snæfellsnes.
1122790 1124491 - Oh, you from there.<br />- Yeah.
1124525 1127260 How long were you out<br />for fishing?
1127294 1129162 - Uh, overnight.<br />- Uh-huh.
1129196 1130473 But sometimes<br />a little bit longer
1130497 1133367 if we went, uh,<br />up here to Látrabjarg.
1133400 1136336 - Ooh. What did you say?<br />- Látrabjarg.
1136370 1138906 - Látrabjarg. Látrabjarg.<br />- Látrabjarg.

1151686 1154254 and, uh, haddock, as well.
1154287 1156791 Ah, good for fish and chips.
1156824 1158325 Exactly.
1158358 1161194 - I grew up by the sea, too.<br />- Really?
1161228 1162764 - Mm.<br />- Hmm.
1162797 1164197 May I see your hands?
1164231 1166433 Yeah.
1169937 1171873 The scars.

1256791 1258726 Good morning.
1272472 1275033 So far, so good. Smart boy<br />don't break anything yet.
1275034 1276901 It's only his first day.
1277276 1280113 Goto-san, hurry up.<br />- Coming.
1284367 1286577 We're going out for our break.<br />- Alright.
1289123 1290958 When you're finished<br />cleaning up,
1290992 1293460 you have a break until 6:00.
1294662 1295428 I take nap.
1295462 1298398 You leave if you want.<br />Fresh air.
1299000 1301602 But first, finish.
1303104 1304705 Thank you, Takahashi.
1304739 1306674 Uh, san.
1318119 1320588 Hello, mate.<br />You all right there?
1320621 1321989 Yeah.

1334434 1336079 at the back there.<br />What you quite often have
1336103 1338573 is teams want to play<br />like Man City,
1338606 1342442 but, uh... but asking National<br />South players to do that,
1342475 1344846 the young goalkeeper there<br />struggling...
1344879 1346479 What do you reckon?
1347615 1350117 Do you know<br />what this stands for?
1350151 1352153 I'm not that good at Chinese.
1352186 1354121 It's actually kanji.

1881415 1883484 Uh, Addiscombe Grove.
1884686 1888355 But that's some time ago.<br />50 years.
1888389 1889657 50 years?
1889691 1892259 To be more exact, 51.
1892292 1893528 Mr. Hannesson...
1896397 1898499 If I may be so bold,
1898533 1901301 you are the last guest left.
1901335 1904004 We have to close the hotel<br />as soon as possible.
1904037 1905339 You may want to go back
1905372 1908008 while there are still flights<br />to Iceland.
1908041 1909209 I'm not going back.
1909243 1911145 Well, there is<br />no Hitomi Nakamura
1911178 1912389 living in Croydon<br />that I can see.
1912413 1915149 - There-there...<br />- Let me be more exact.
1915182 1918018 Last time I checked it<br />20 years ago, she had moved.
1918051 1920421 So you-you looked for her<br />20 years ago,
1920454 1923290 - but you-you couldn't find her then?<br />- Yeah.
1923323 1924559 Let me explain.
1924592 1925660 Okay.
1927060 1929430 Please do.
1933233 1935537 - Mmm.<br />- Mmm.
1935570 1936924 - You try.<br />- Mmm.
1936925 1939146 It's better with a pinch of salt.<br />- I agree.
1939774 1943277 - Mmm. Really good.<br />- Need more time in jar.
1943310 1944344 Mm.

1963740 1965667 Kasuzuke. Kasuzuke.
1965700 1967501 Pickle with, uh, uh, sake yeast.
1967535 1969136 Mm.

2026275 2028652 Do you have a girlfriend?
2029564 2031198 "Garfrendo"?
2031231 2033535 Do you have a girlfriend?
2033568 2035269 No.
2035302 2038405 Did you ever have a girlfriend?
2038438 2039741 Yes.
2039774 2041441 Did you talk a lot<br />with her father?
2041442 2043250 Miko, stop that.
2044278 2045713 I... didn't know her father.
2045747 2049517 So you never talked about your<br />relationship with his daughter?
2051251 2051819 No.
2051853 2054154 It, uh, wasn't serious.
2054187 2056624 We didn't have any expectations.
2057257 2059527 So that's what makes<br />a relationship serious?
2059558 2062728 Not whether you have<br />the permission from the father.
2068135 2070137 I'm sorry, Kristofer-san.
2070170 2072105 Could you give us privacy?
2114655 2116365 Damn it.

2372874 2374742 So they moved back home?
2374775 2379680 Yes. Takahashi-san contact me<br />many years later.
2381883 2383651 But what about Miko?
2384185 2387121 Miko, she only contact me

2516917 2519320 Hey, Barry. Did you find<br />anything in Japanese?
2519353 2520654 - Yeah.<br />- Great.
2520688 2523090 This is the only thing I found,
2523124 2526027 but it should give you<br />an insight into the aftermath
2526060 2527895 from their perspective.
2527928 2530264 - Okay. Perfect. Thank you.<br />- It's good to see you again.
2530297 2531899 You, too, Barry.<br />Have a good day.

2586918 2588753 What's your name?
2589657 2591659 "Uh, I don't understand.
2591692 2593227 Don't you speak English?"
2594009 2596761 You're so funny, Takahashi.
2597898 2598666 Hello.
2598699 2601102 Oh, Kristofer-san.
2601135 2604705 - I'm a so beautiful monkfish.<br />- Fish.
2604738 2606607 Don't you think?
2606938 2610567 You are really cute,<br />Mr. Monkfish.
2611278 2613681 Oh!
2613714 2615649 - Oh. Kristofer-san.<br />- Uh-huh?
2615683 2617384 You know haiku?
2617418 2618853 Yeah, I've heard of it.
2618886 2620855 - Uh, Japanese poem.<br />- Mm-hmm.
2620888 2622156 - Only three lines.<br />- Mm-hmm.
2622189 2623390 Very, very simple.
2623424 2625359 Very, very difficult.
2625392 2628362 - I wrote a haiku about a fish.<br />- Uh-huh.
2628395 2629997 This one in Japanese.
2630030 2631232 You read.
2631265 2633000 Oh...
2633033 2633868 No, I can't. I...
2633901 2635145 I just started learning,<br />Takahashi-san.
2635169 2637037 Try. I'll help.
2637071 2638139 I'll help.
2638172 2639273 Try.
2639306 2640875 Uh...
2640908 2642246 - This is...<br />- Mm.
2642247 2644267 {\an8}<i>On dry land, the fish</i>
2645602 2648146 {\an8}<i>pretends not to speak a word</i>
2648849 2650397 "Iwana." Iwana is a fish.
2650398 2651483 <i>Of Japanese language.</i>
2652192 2656488 <i>On dry land, the fish pretends not to<br />speak a word of Japanese language.</i>
2657291 2658392 Thank you.
2658425 2660261 This is a haiku.
2660294 2661896 Hai. Uh, sometimes,
2661929 2666267 uh, there is<br />a personal confession in haiku.
2666300 2667968 - Interesting. Mm?<br />- Really?
2668002 2668969 So...
2668970 2670377 Listen everyone.
2670752 2674297 Once I worked in a restaurant<br />where they had a haiku bowl.
2674547 2676633 Everyone wrote a haiku<br />and put it in the bowl.
2677211 2679246 Takahashi-san wants us<br />to write haiku
2679280 2680247 and put it in the bowl.
2680281 2681322 No. No, no.
2681323 2683765 I'm going to put it here.
2683973 2687519 All of you write one.<br />You too.
2688088 2690090 No, no, no. No, no, no, no.
2702700 2704953 Thank you for coming, Naruki-San.
2705829 2707247 I'm Takahashi.
2708665 2711793 Nice to meet you.<br />- Excuse the short notice.

2759293 2761161 - For me?<br />- Mm-hmm.
2772353 2773354 Hello.
2773897 2775565 I didn't know you<br />like Japanese food.
2775690 2777108 How are you?
2777400 2780195 I'm fine. How are you?<br />- Fine, fine.
2780612 2782196 I thought you had gone<br />home for the summer.
2782197 2784698 We got a job at school.<br />- Really? Doing what?
2784699 2785783 Research.
2786201 2788995 I work for Morgan.<br />Jonas for Engstrom.
2789996 2790997 Engstrom?
2791581 2795543 You always said he was an idiot. What changed?<br />- That's not true.
2795668 2799130 For God's sake, don't start<br />with that communist nonsense.
2800757 2802634 We just came to say hello.
2802800 2805553 How do you like it here?<br />- Just great.
2806721 2808264 Aren't they all Japanese?
2812477 2814521 It's a Japanese restaurant.
2814771 2815897 You know what it's called.
2816022 2817440 Kamikaze.
2822956 2824696 Kamikaze.
2824697 2826032 When are you coming back?
2826449 2829577 To school?<br />I'm not coming back.
2829744 2832830 You're not?<br />- No, of course not.
2833122 2835792 Maybe we should all become dishwashers.
2836125 2838878 Then we'd reach perfect equality.
2839921 2840964 Sure.
2841172 2843716 Well, I have to get back<br />to do your dishes.
2844634 2846135 Cheers.<br />- Good luck.

2899772 2902817 Would you like something to drink?
2903192 2906487 Red wine.<br />- Red wine it is. I'll bring it to you.

2983283 2985357 Uh, no.<br />I've never heard it before.
2985358 2986359 You know,
2986984 2990613 Kristofer sings in a choir in Iceland.
2991291 2993661 Oh, you sing in a choir?
2993695 2995530 And you don't tell me?
2997097 2999534 Why don't you sing a song<br />for Dr. Kobayashi?
2999567 3000583 No.
3000584 3001735 Please sing.
3001736 3003705 No, no, no, no.

3088488 3090625 I didn't know you could sing.
3090658 3092594 It was very good.
3093728 3095395 Jesus Christ.
3166400 3168569 Morning.<br />You are up early, Kristofer.
3168603 3170872 - Good morning.<br />- You want some breakfast?
3170905 3173541 - Uh...<br />- Bacon? Sausage?
3173574 3176276 Uh, no, Mrs. Ellis. Thank you.<br />I'm late for work.
3176309 3178445 Too early to be late.
3178478 3181883 Bit of fried bread?<br />Grease your lungs.
3181916 3183316 Bye-bye.
3183350 3184652 Funny boy.
3193293 3195997 Arai-san is not so good today.
3196030 3198933 Too much drinking last night.
3198966 3201301 Yeah, he was having<br />a lot of fun.
3201903 3204204 You make torikatsu.
3204806 3206406 - Me?<br />- Yes, you.
3215282 3217317 - Um, Takahashi-san.<br />- Hmm?
3217350 3219587 Uh, I've been wondering.
3219620 3222990 Would it be okay if I came here<br />in the morning
3223024 3224859 to practice cooking?
3224892 3227862 I'd-I'd clean up after myself<br />and pay for whatever I used.
3227895 3229030 No.
3229063 3231331 - You don't pay.<br />- Mm.
3231364 3232734 What do you want to cook?
3232767 3235002 I'd just like to see<br />if I can make the, you know,
3235036 3237705 the traditional breakfast<br />myself.
3237739 3239402 I-If that's okay.
3239403 3241864 Of course, Kristofer-san.
3242643 3243611 Thank you.
3242698 3244075 Thank you very much.
3244846 3246379 Thank you.
3245701 3247061 Here's your appetizer.<br />- Thank you.
3247119 3249622 A beer for Mr. Yamamoto.<br />- Okay.
3252041 3253668 Takahashi-san.
3255586 3259173 Hitomi.<br />It's not a dead fly.
3261394 3264431 Oh. Kristofer-san.
3265388 3266931 What is it?
3267802 3269070 "A calm sea,
3269103 3273340 "but waves, high as a mountain,
3273373 3276309 breaking inside my head."
3276978 3279080 Waves only in the head.
3279113 3281048 Very emotional.
3281082 3282884 You're a good poet.
3294250 3300840 <i>(Sings in Italian)</i>
3301048 3304260 Arai-san, have you seen Kristofer?
3304510 3308931 <i>(Sings in Japanese)<br />He is out in the backyard.</i>
3323591 3327394 Dad says you want to be a cook.
3327427 3330698 - He told you that?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3330731 3333568 Uh, no, no.
3333601 3336637 Well, I-I just want to see<br />if I can make the...
3336671 3339574 you know, the traditional<br />breakfast properly.
3339607 3343410 And who's going to be<br />the judge of that?
3344145 3346479 Me, I guess.
3348983 3351351 Do you want me to come?
3352019 3353754 Yes.
3354155 3356157 But you can't be<br />too tough on me, though.
3356190 3358726 Are you afraid of that?
3358759 3360094 Yes.
3360127 3362663 Miko, I'm terrified of you.
3385299 3389553 <i>Dear passengers,<br />we'll be landing in 10 minutes.</i>
3390846 3392932 <i>Please fasten your seat belts.</i>
3394058 3400940 <i>Keep your electric devices<br />turned off until landing.</i>
3410616 3413786 We've yet to talk about<br />Sonja, your daughter.
3414662 3416247 How old was she when<br />you started dating?
3416413 3418374 Wasn't she...<br />- She was turning seven.
3418666 3419750 Seven.
3420084 3421710 How did she respond to you?
3422002 3424255 Just fine.<br />- Really well.
3424547 3426257 Does she call you 'Dad'?
3426799 3428384 Usually she does.
3428843 3431345 But 'Kristofer' if I upset her.
3431887 3436350 That rarely happens.<br />He overindulges her.
3437101 3438435 How so?
3439353 3443149 Well, I'm the one who ends up<br />setting her boundaries.
3444733 3447278 Did you ever discuss<br />having children of your own?
3450781 3455286 Inga thought it might be<br />too much for Sonja at first.
3456745 3458873 Then time passed and...
3463130 3464276 Mm-hmm.
3464277 3466797 So you chose to postpone<br />having more children?
3469175 3470176 Yes.
3470718 3472428 Was that the reason?
3475764 3476765 No.
3489190 3490591 Hello, mate.
3490624 3491592 - What can I get you?<br />- Hey. Good morning.
3491625 3493928 - Um...<br />- Clams.
3493961 3497732 We've got some quahogs<br />from Dorset. Slightly sweet.
3497765 3501068 Razors from Shetland.<br />The Scots call them "spoots."

3598971 3601098 You look good in that jacket.
3603100 3604935 Thank you very much.

3639636 3641096 Thank you.

3647114 3651452 So, what do you do<br />when you're not working here?
3651485 3655689 I read, listen to music,
3655723 3657791 try to study Japanese.
3657825 3660094 Well, sounds like<br />you're doing really well.
3660127 3661862 Thank you.
3662284 3666497 Do you miss home?
3668202 3670304 Mm.
3670337 3672460 - Uh, Iceland.<br />- Mm-hmm.

3674421 3678842 What about you?<br />- This is my home now.
3679313 3682483 Oh, no, I mean, um, Hiroshima.<br />Do you miss Hiroshima?
3682517 3685319 Hiroshima...
3685352 3686921 There's nothing left.
3686954 3690925 We left a long time ago,<br />and we're not going back.
3690958 3693794 - I'm sorry.<br />- It's okay.
3695829 3699099 I put, um, clams in the soup.

3727094 3730030 - Does she live in Iceland?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3731398 3733834 Did you sleep with her?
3735002 3736437 Yes.
3736470 3738305 How was it?
3738339 3740174 Excuse me?
3740207 3742343 Was it good?
3742376 3744011 Yes.
3747348 3750985 But it wasn't serious?
3751018 3752119 No.
3753287 3755155 So you didn't love her?
3761362 3763063 I was fond of her.
3768168 3769937 So, um...
3771905 3775843 why did you come here to work?
3777444 3780047 Because of you.
3784318 3786153 Um...

3797532 3800301 When you were leaving...
3800334 3801603 Mm-hmm.
3801636 3804271 and I was coming in.
3810944 3813981 I told Dad not to hire you.

4098198 4101769 Do you have children,<br />Kutaragi-san?
4101803 4106608 My son, he's salaryman like me.
4106641 4108475 Very busy.
4109811 4113581 Too busy for old father.
4114849 4117071 I thought I had<br />put it on silent.
4117072 4118073 Sorry.
4120387 4122322 - Your daughter again?<br />- Yeah.
4123658 4125793 It's about her birthday.
4125827 4129363 Oh, you forget her birthday?
4129396 4131465 Oh, yes. And what's even worse,
4131498 4134167 I forget to tell her<br />about me going to Japan.
4134201 4135770 Oh.
4135803 4138338 Not good, eh?
4138372 4141809 - I know. I know.<br />- Kristofer-san...
4141843 4143611 not good.
4179614 4181716 He's everywhere.
4181749 4183283 Who?
4183851 4185485 Jesus.
4190958 4195563 Mrs. Ellis is really religious.
4195596 4198398 She screwed and stuck it<br />to the wall.
4201368 4205205 Is he supposed to keep<br />an eye on you?
4207274 4208910 Well, I hope not.
4208943 4210812 I'm gonna be in big trouble.
4221354 4224224 I can't stand it.
4233835 4237739 I felt like he looked at me<br />differently when I left.
4237772 4239507 Takahashi-san.
4241374 4243845 That's just your imagination.
4243878 4246346 Why can't he know about us?
4247982 4252653 I mean, why does he have<br />to know about us?
4254522 4257357 So we can stop sneaking around.
4259761 4262362 I don't get it.
4262395 4264732 Thought you said he liked me.
4264766 4267300 He does like you.
4270337 4272673 I just don't understand.
4285920 4289389 What is it<br />that you don't understand?
4301903 4304572 - Kristofer.<br />- Morning.
4304605 4309110 Your friend, the young lady,<br />where is she from?
4309143 4310912 She's from here.
4310945 4313714 And before that?
4313748 4315049 Japan.
4315082 4318451 Mm. Be careful.
4325155 4326406 {\an8}'Futsu-shu.'
4327128 4329797 Uh, basic sake.
4329831 4331732 And, uh...
4331828 4334581 'Junmai Daiginjo, Hakkaisan.'
4335736 4337505 Very premium.
4337538 4339543 - Strong.<br />- Strong.
4339544 4342505 We'll have some Hakkaisan, please.<br />- Yes.
4345508 4347886 It's very tasty.
4348850 4350718 Why did you come here?
4350751 4353754 I always dreamt of<br />visiting Japan.
4353788 4354989 Mm-hmm.
4355022 4357625 Ooh. Here.
4357771 4360607 Cheers to our friendship.<br />- Cheers to our friendship.
4361062 4362663 Oh, sounds good.
4361691 4363109 Cheers.<br />- Cheers.
4370171 4373741 - Very good.<br />- Good.
4376143 4378746 I marry in 1970.
4380081 4382884 When my wife died,
4382917 4385485 I feel very lonely.
4389056 4391826 40 years married.
4391859 4393694 40 years.
4395529 4399967 You ever hear<br />the Japanese word "kodokushi"?
4400001 4401501 No.
4401535 4403638 My Japanese is not that good.
4403671 4408509 It means "fear of dying alone."
4410578 4413714 You even have a special word<br />for that.
4419086 4420821 Kristofer-san.
4420959 4423253 You are not here just to visit Japan.
4424838 4427298 Why did you come all this way?
4448816 4449717 Don't worry.
4449750 4453220 Dad won't be home<br />until after midnight.
4453254 4454889 He never is.
4454922 4458826 And what about the neighbors?<br />They might see us.
4458859 4463030 Well, they don't care for us,<br />and we don't talk to them.
4463064 4465566 Dad likes it that way.
4485231 4486441 My mother.
4486941 4488693 And this is Miko, right?
4489290 4491491 That's me.
4493260 4494962 Come.
4528329 4532533 My mum painted them.
4535703 4539740 Dad and Mum lived in Hiroshima.
4539774 4544645 And... Grandma and Grandpa<br />were visiting that day.
4546380 4548049 It was the summer holidays,
4548082 4553587 so Dad and a few others<br />were repairing a school roof...
4553621 4556957 just outside Hiroshima<br />when the bomb fell.
4558692 4561896 Mum was six months pregnant.
4562296 4567234 I don't know how Dad managed<br />to find the ruins of the house.
4567268 4570871 He says he has no memory of it.
4574075 4577678 Only of the burned earth
4577711 4579847 and the black rain...
4581348 4584185 and the river
4584218 4586887 filled with floating corpses.
4589390 4591692 When Dad found Mum,
4591725 4595729 she herself was badly burned.
4601869 4606707 She gave birth to me<br />a month prematurely.
4614782 4619887 And she died a year later.
4628429 4631932 So I'm still a hibakusha.
4647181 4648449 - Hitomi.<br />- Yes?
4648482 4650217 Can I ask you something?
4650251 4651852 Of course.
4651886 4654755 This word, "hibakusha,"<br />uh, what does it mean?
4654788 4657391 Where did you hear that word?
4657424 4659860 I just saw it somewhere.
4659894 4661862 You should learn<br />different Japanese words.
4661896 4664732 Uh, can't you just tell me<br />what it means?
4668369 4671672 It means "atomic bomb survivor."
4675510 4678345 And what if you can't find her?
4678379 4680781 It's been a long time.
4681982 4685186 Yeah. You know something?
4685219 4686987 Lots of Japanese people,
4687021 4689089 they travel<br />all the way to Iceland
4689123 4692059 in hope of seeing<br />the northern lights.
4693093 4696964 But knowing that<br />they might not, they still go.
4697765 4699767 - Eh.<br />- I understand...
4699800 4701468 - Yeah.<br />- Kristofer-san.
4701502 4704471 Life very short.
4704506 4706493 Always good to sing.

4941729 4945066 Thank you for taking the time to come, doctor.<br />- No problem.
4975888 4977264 Good evening.
4977723 4978849 Welcome.

5059527 5063297 What are you<br />going to do for the holiday?
5063330 5066366 Yamamoto-san complains<br />that we close for the holiday.
5066400 5069336 I said, "One week,<br />Yamamoto-san. Only one week.
5069369 5072139 You eat somewhere else<br />for one week."
5072172 5075142 He said, "No, eight days.
5075175 5078312 You close for eight days."
5078345 5079847 So, what are you going to do?
5079881 5083450 Uh... don't know.
5083483 5084586 - No?<br />- No.
5084619 5086521 Uh, don't have anything planned.
5086554 5088374 Oh. Oh...
5088375 5090711 What about you, Takahashi?<br />Are you going somewhere?
5091212 5092922 We go somewhere, yes.
5094340 5095341 Really?
5095591 5097760 Takahashi never goes anywhere.
5099701 5102369 Takahashi-san never go anywhere.
5108910 5110778 Make sure to lock up.
5110812 5112513 Yeah. Of course.
5153554 5154889 - Hi.<br />- Hi.
5154922 5157257 I didn't expect<br />to see you tonight.
5157859 5160260 Is everything okay?
5167401 5170805 Um, I have something for you.
5170838 5172807 For me?
5172840 5174942 It's fragile.
5174976 5177177 Thank you.
5178680 5180548 It was my mum's cup.
5180581 5182282 She made it.
5182917 5184686 Fujisan.
5184719 5187387 Fujisan. It's beautiful.
5187421 5190792 Are there Japanese people<br />in Iceland?
5190825 5193393 Um, not that I know of.
5193995 5196296 Any Asian people?
5196329 5198833 Probably at the embassies or...
5198866 5200568 That's it?
5200601 5202302 Yeah.
5202335 5204572 Wh-What's going on, Miko?
5205606 5207508 Can you tell me<br />what you're thinking?
5303436 5304705 Miko?
5348260 5349511 Hi Dad.
5350804 5352765 Have you found your friend?
5354933 5356852 Won't you just come home?
5357519 5359229 I'm worried about you.
5403004 5404772 Did they fire you?
5404805 5407775 Uh, no, we're closed<br />for vacation.
5407808 5409176 Oh.
5409210 5410645 Until tomorrow.
5410678 5412647 I go back to work tomorrow.

5415149 5417484 Said it was for you.
5421055 5422455 Who?

5446213 5447715 He closed it down? When?
5447748 5451218 Tuesday.<br />I-It happened very fast.
5451252 5453754 He asked me<br />to take care of the fish.
5453788 5455823 Where's Miko?
5455856 5459226 I don't see Miko, but I think<br />she leave with Takahashi-san.
5459260 5461262 Leave? Leave where?
5461295 5464231 Takahashi-san don't say.
5473708 5474918 - Okay.<br />- Can you take that side?
5474942 5477011 - Is that too heavy?<br />- No, it's fine.
5477044 5478512 Take it carefully.

5808342 5810077 Yes.
5813981 5816116 I hope you had a good life.
5822624 5825025 Nothing to complain about.
5829631 5833233 Miko, shouldn't you be resting?
5833267 5835502 I can come some other day<br />if you like.
5835537 5837471 No. The doctors say
5837504 5840307 I'm no longer contagious, but...
5840341 5842242 I don't know.
5847448 5849083 I...
5849116 5851218 I brought you some flowers.
5851251 5853354 They...
5853387 5855856 they might need water.
5873608 5875275 Miko?
5876477 5878278 Yes.
5890592 5892960 Kristofer.
5894194 5896029 Miko.
5899634 5902102 Forgive me.
5903504 5905906 You don't need to...
5917585 5919319 Oh. Forgive me.
5922055 5924391 Mm.
5948015 5950217 Forgive me.
5964632 5965733 Mm.
5991358 5992392 Oh.
5992393 5993530 You're still here.
5994261 5996363 I'm not going anywhere.
6015009 6017679 What time is it?<br />- Midday.
6018304 6019848 Already?
6020655 6023323 Mm. But you needed the rest.
6025125 6026645 You want some tea?
6026646 6027694 Thank you.
6027695 6030130 Green tea?
6040407 6043310 Mm.
6055657 6058492 I looked you up later.
6058526 6059761 Much later.
6059794 6062062 You did?
6063765 6065733 I found you.
6065767 6068201 You were married.
6069571 6072272 You must have hated me.
6072840 6075108 Never.
6075142 6078378 But I was angry<br />for a long, long time.
6080682 6082482 I'm sorry.
6088355 6090190 Ah.
6090892 6094194 It's nice to get some fresh air.
6096831 6099099 You still smoke?
6100668 6102135 Is that a problem?
6102169 6104371 Reminds me on our first talk.
6105472 6106841 Oh.
6106874 6108610 In the backyard at Nippon.
6108643 6110243 Exactly.
6111378 6114882 I've pictured us there<br />so many times,
6114916 6118418 but more in my room.
6119486 6121488 We're alone,
6121522 6124859 and you start<br />asking about my father.
6126527 6128407 I was so scared of him,<br />that he might come home.
6137905 6141809 Hashimoto-san told me
6141843 6144444 that you worked with children.
6145613 6147314 Children.
6148448 6152219 They became my passion,<br />you know?
6153955 6156423 I never married.
6162730 6165499 Do you remember the word...
6165533 6166901 "hibakusha"?
6166934 6168903 Yes, of course.
6168936 6171438 Atomic bomb survivor.
6171471 6173240 Yes.
6173808 6176343 Well, I was 11
6176376 6179279 when Dad first told me<br />what happened to Mum.
6180247 6182884 About the bombing of Hiroshima.
6183584 6187320 Until then, I only knew that<br />we had lived here in Hiroshima
6187354 6189724 before we moved to Tokyo.
6189757 6191526 But now...
6191559 6195195 he felt he had no choice<br />but to tell me.
6195630 6199466 That was the first time<br />I heard the word "hibakusha."
6200635 6202904 There was a lot<br />of discrimination.
6202937 6206306 There still is, in some way.
6206339 6210310 People thought<br />it was hereditary.
6212013 6215215 Some people thought<br />it was contagious.
6217484 6219721 Dad wanted<br />to get away from it all,
6219754 6222222 so we moved to London.
6223558 6227028 You know, at first,<br />his rules and prohibitions
6227061 6229530 - didn't affect me.<br />- Hmm.
6230898 6234645 But then I hit puberty.
6234646 6237357 There are imperfections inside you.
6238441 6240234 Inside,
6242487 6244197 you're damaged.
6245740 6247325 This child,
6248326 6250119 is severely disabled.
6250745 6254123 The child was in the womb<br />when the mother was exposed to radiation.
6254457 6256084 Like you,
6256918 6259295 she is a hibakusha.
6264634 6265635 But Dad.
6265885 6270723 There's no evidence<br />I can't have healthy children.
6270932 6272183 You promised me.
6273851 6277605 If you bear a child like this,
6279148 6281275 you won't be able to take care of it.
6283350 6285418 Do you remember when Naruki
6285452 6287387 came to the restaurant?
6288388 6292392 That's when Dad told him<br />I was a hibakusha.
6293795 6295563 That was enough.
6296964 6299066 But I didn't care.
6299100 6301301 I had met you.
6302570 6306507 And then something changed,<br />didn't it?
6309944 6311712 Yes.
6312580 6315016 I thought I found the answer.
6315049 6318786 Persuading Dad wasn't easy,
6318820 6321823 but he agreed.
6321856 6324025 Of two evils,
6324058 6327562 sterilization was better
6327595 6330631 than having to trust me<br />to keep my promise.
6330665 6332432 Sterilization?
6333067 6335402 I thought that was the only way.
6359353 6360354 Excuse me.
6360646 6363483 I have an appointment<br />with Dr. Kobayashi.
6376746 6377747 Takahashi-san.
6378456 6379874 I've been expecting you.
6380166 6381209 Please, this way.
6388174 6389967 I'll examine you by hand.
6401729 6403689 Your uterus is a bit enlarged.
6404565 6406734 When was the last time<br />you had your period?
6420721 6424759 Dad didn't ask<br />who the father was.
6424792 6426527 The father?
6429230 6431532 I told him.
6434568 6436804 He was so fond of you.
6436837 6439707 I thought it would help,<br />but it didn't.
6441876 6444145 I was gonna tell you<br />about my pregnancy,
6444178 6447615 but I lost my courage.
6447648 6451652 To Dad, I had committed<br />the crime he most feared.
6452853 6455856 He was convinced<br />the baby was disabled.
6457191 6459560 I started believing it, too.
6461529 6464464 He ordered me to stay at home.
6465266 6466834 He closed Nippon,
6466867 6469570 paid the staff,<br />booked our flights,
6469603 6471973 all in a matter of days.
6472006 6473774 Said goodbye to no one.
6475876 6480581 We moved to Takehara,<br />village east of here.
6482116 6484885 <i>This was where his roots were.</i>
6485753 6487955 <i>Where he had buried my mother.</i>
6489290 6491625 <i>After everything,</i>
6491659 6493894 <i>after more than 20 years away...</i>
6496230 6499300 <i>after he had escaped,</i>
6499333 6501702 <i>he came back.</i>
6502079 6504582 Is my baby okay?
6506125 6508127 It looks fine.
6510546 6512632 Congratulations.<br />- Thank you very much.
6522183 6523976 Sign.
6525811 6527980 Important papers. Just sign.
6531359 6532652 The doctor says,
6533736 6535488 the defects will appear later.
6538706 6540941 <i>His name is Akira.</i>
6542109 6544945 Your son's name is Akira.
6546347 6549183 He looks like you.
6549216 6551152 We were very lucky.
6551185 6553320 He was adopted by good people.
6553354 6556023 The husband is Australian,
6556057 6557958 the wife Japanese.
6559026 6561796 Mm. Akira.
6561829 6564799 - You said the name was Akira.<br />- Yes.
6564832 6567668 I love the sound of it.
6579080 6580981 Guess what he does.
6583050 6584652 He's a chef.
6584685 6586287 - No.<br />- Yes.
6586320 6589056 He runs a restaurant in Kure.
6589090 6592693 It-It's an oyster boat<br />on the river Sakai.
6592726 6595096 He cooks everything himself.
6595129 6596897 Oh, he's a very good chef.
6596931 6600601 And I go see him<br />every week for lunch.
6601202 6603304 Does he know about you?
6603337 6605940 No, he'll never know.
6605973 6609710 I... I'm a regular.<br />I-I sit at the bar.
6609743 6612279 Oh, we talk of this and that,
6612313 6615916 of, uh, food, the weather.
6615950 6618119 And...
6618152 6621122 he has two daughters.
6621155 6623724 - No.<br />- Yes.
6623757 6626127 The older is an engineer.
6626160 6630764 The younger studies history<br />at university.
6688789 6690991 - Okay.<br />- Yeah.
6696330 6697998 Come.
6729515 6733269 Welcome to the restaurant,<br />this way please.
6740568 6742027 Thank you very much.
6757877 6762006 Miko-san, good to see you again.<br />- Thank you very much.
6762882 6767344 How are your daughters doing?<br />- They are fine, thank you.
6768721 6772224 This is my friend from Iceland.
6772641 6774018 Iceland?
6775394 6778272 We met in London.
6779648 6781150 This is Akira-san.
6781567 6783611 This is Kristofer Hannesson-san.
6784069 6787323 Kristofer-san...<br />Welcome to my restaurant "Kakibune."
6788289 6789890 Mm.
6793287 6796582 Are you alright, sir?<br />- I'm fine.
6797291 6800753 I'm fine. I'm fine.
6802213 6803672 Good.
6804381 6807468 He can speak a little Japanese.<br />- Yes, he can.
6820481 6822399 Enjoy your meal.<br />- Thank you.
6829365 6831200 See how he looks like you.
6846347 6848048 Do you still sing?
6849350 6851051 Less and less.
6851686 6853954 There's little left of my voice.
6854488 6856123 Hmm.
6857124 6859893 Well, what was the song you sang
6859927 6863030 at the birthday party at Nippon?
6863598 6865432 You mean...
6867000 6869069 You talking about that one?
6870037 6873040 That was<br />when I fell in love with you.
6875577 6878178 Think that would work again?
6879246 6880981 You can try.
6884418 6886019 Oh.
6886053 6888222 You're still shy.
6888255 6890257 - Oh, yeah. Can't help it.<br />- After all these years.
6890290 6893093 Can't help it.
6894428 6896196 Mmm.
6897632 6899299 Yeah.
