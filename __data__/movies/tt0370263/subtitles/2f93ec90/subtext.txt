223473 225933 Hey. Hey, hey.
226018 227894 Come here.<br />Take a look at this.
227978 230313 <i>(Beeping continues)</i>
230397 233482 - What is it?<br />- It's a data stream from PS12.
233567 236777 - Where is she?<br />- Right above Sector 14.
237988 240031 There isn't anything in Sector 14.

272272 275441 <i>(Man on earpiece) Miss Woods,<br />pleasure to make your acquaintance.</i>
275525 278152 - Who is this?<br />- <i>My name's Maxwell Stafford.</i>
278236 280237 - <i>I represent Weyland Industries.</i><br />- <i>(Grunts)</i>
281239 283366 Let me guess.<br />He's suing us again?
283450 286452 <i>You misunderstand. Mr. Weyland—<br />he's offered to fund...</i>
286536 291374 <i>the foundation with which you are associated<br />for a full year if you'll meet with him.</i>
291458 293334 - When?<br />- <i>Tomorrow.</i>
293418 295795 Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.
295879 297797 <i>(Grunts)</i>
297881 300132 It'll take me a week<br />to get back to the world.
300217 303260 Yes, I told Mr. Weyland that.
303345 305888 He said he didn't have a week.
308558 310393 <i>(Chattering)</i>
318026 321737 <i>(Chattering in Spanish)</i>
323115 325533 We must be right on top of it.
345971 347930 <i>(Man) What is it, Sebastian?</i>
357399 359400 <i>(Crowd murmuring)</i>
362195 364739 <i>(Man) Early 1950s, I'd say.</i>
364823 367992 Hey, Juan, we are almost there.
368076 370035 Huh. According to you...
370120 373330 the Teotihuacán's final gift to<br />their dying king was a Pepsi.
373415 376208 - Come on. Give me one more month, please.<br />- <i>(Juan) No.</i>
376293 378711 I'm bringing in another team.
378795 380588 What?
380672 384008 <i>(Thomas) Without a crew and<br />a new permit, we're out of business.</i>
384092 386761 Okay. Hold the team<br />together for two days.
386845 389847 I'll go to Mexico City,<br />and I'll talk to the bank.
389931 392057 - I'll get us more money.<br />- Right.
392142 395352 I might be able to help you<br />accomplish that, Professor.
396813 398898 Do I know you?
398982 402777 In exchange for a little<br />of your time.
406615 408616 <i>(Helicopter whirring)</i>
421213 423422 <i>(Beep, shutter clicks)</i>
426885 430179 Oh. I'm sorry. I should have, um,<br />switched the flash off.
430263 432389 There's your magazine.
432474 435100 - Excuse me.<br />- That's okay.
435185 438270 I'm— I'm documenting<br />the trip for my boys.
438355 441774 This is them. Jacob and Scotty.
441858 445694 - Would you mind just taking a picture? Thank you.<br />- Sure.
445779 448989 Just want to show them that their dad<br />wasn't always so boring.
449074 450241 - Smile.<br />- Okay.
450325 452785 - <i>(Beeps)</i><br />- Oh.
452869 455162 - There you go.<br />- Thank you.
455247 458707 Uh, I'm Graeme Miller.<br />I'm a chemical engineer.
458792 461585 Alexa Woods.<br />Environmental technician and guide.
461670 463629 Do you work for Weyland?
463713 466882 Oh, no. No. I, um—
466967 469844 I split my time between working for<br />a small environmental group...
469928 472847 and taking scientists<br />on expeditions on the ice.
472931 476392 <i>(Man) Lex. You and your friend buckle up.<br />We're gonna hit some turbulence.</i>
476476 477977 <i>(Lex) Thanks, Jack.</i>
479563 481522 - Is he a friend of yours?<br />- Of my dad's.
481606 484441 My father trained<br />most of the pilots down here.
484526 487611 - <i>(Jack) Just passed the P.S.R.</i><br />- Damn. I wish I got a picture.
487696 490489 - Of what?<br />- Um, the... the "P.S.R."
490574 492992 I wish he'd called it out<br />before we passed it.
494578 497997 The P.S.R. is the<br />"Point of Safe Return."
498081 501292 It means we've used up half our fuel,<br />so we can't turn back.
503295 505546 Right. But if something<br />went wrong, we could, uh...
505630 508465 land, presumably.
508550 510718 - We could ditch.<br />- Yeah. Ditch.
510802 513804 But the temperature of the water<br />would kill us in three minutes.
533992 538245 - Weyland's check cleared.<br />- Good. You know what?
538330 541665 We're gonna listen to whatever<br />he has to say. We nod, we smile...
541750 544918 and we politely decline<br />whatever offer he makes.
545003 547504 Take the money,<br />and we head back to Mexico.
547589 549256 - Right.<br />- Right.
549341 551675 - <i>(Beeping)</i><br />- <i>(Engine starts)</i>
554679 556680 <i>(Engine stops)</i>
558224 560100 <i>(Chuckles)</i>
560185 563187 - Havin' fun?<br />- Yeah. It's quite an adventure.
563271 567024 Listen, my kids are not going to believe<br />this. Would you mind taking a picture?
567108 571236 - Um, you have to hold it like that till it flashes twice.<br />- You're kidding.
571321 575491 - Get off, or you'll wear your ass for a hat.<br />- Okay.
575575 578452 - All right. Okay. Sure.<br />- Nice team spirit.
580455 583123 Keep the beakers<br />away from the gear.
586252 588170 What does he mean, "beaker"?
588254 590839 That's what they call<br />scientists out here.
590924 595135 - You know, Beaker, like in <i>The Muppet Show.</i><br />- <i>(Maxwell) Everybody, please.</i>
595220 597388 Your attention.
602185 606230 - Mr. Weyland.<br />- <i>(Footsteps approaching)</i>
616825 618784 Seven days ago...
618868 622162 one of my satellites over Antarctica<br />hunting for mineral deposits...
622247 625165 discovered a sudden heat bloom<br />beneath the earth...
625250 627501 which outlined this.
627585 629920 The red lines indicate solid walls.
630004 631797 Through thermal mapping...
631881 635384 we've generated a rough three-dimensional<br />image of the structure.
636803 639471 It's massive, containing<br />hundreds of rooms...
639556 642474 all built around a central core.
643977 646353 My experts tell me<br />it's a pyramid.
646438 651066 What they can't agree on<br />is who built it and when.
651151 655863 One expert tells me this has features<br />reminiscent of the Aztecs.
655947 658449 Another tells me<br />it's probably Cambodian.
658533 661827 What they all agree on<br />is that the smooth side...
661911 663120 is definitively Egyptian.
663204 666039 - I think your experts are right.<br />- Which one?
666124 669251 - All of them.<br />- Meaning what exactly?
671212 675507 This pyramid contains<br />the features of all three cultures.
676968 679803 This might be<br />the first pyramid ever built.
679888 682973 - But built by whom?<br />- By the first civilization.
686060 688395 Thank you.
688480 691732 But how could anyone possibly build<br />a pyramid out here?
691816 694026 Ancient maps show<br />Antarctica free of ice.
694110 697905 It's likely the continent<br />was once habitable.
697989 700282 <i>(Miller) Well, I can't tell you<br />who built it, but...</i>
700366 702993 if I can take a sample from it,<br />I can tell you how old it is.
703077 706580 Well, Dr. Miller, I'm offering to put you<br />right next to this thing.
706664 709416 Uh, what caused the heat bloom?
709501 712294 - I don't know.<br />- Where exactly on the ice is this?
712378 716089 Bouvetøya Island.<br />But it's not on the ice.
716174 718008 It's 2,000 feet below it.
721054 723722 - Mr. Quinn.<br />- <i>(Man) Mr. Stafford.</i>
723807 726475 You're looking at the best<br />drilling team in the world.
726559 728811 We'll chew to that depth<br />in seven days.
728895 732231 And add three weeks on top of that<br />to train everyone here.
732315 734775 We don't have that<br />kind of time, Miss Woods.
734859 737653 I'm not the only one with<br />a satellite over Antarctica.
737737 740489 Others will be here— soon.
740573 742491 Maybe I wasn't clear.
742575 744952 No one in this room<br />is ready for this trip.
745036 746954 Well, that's why I asked you here.
747038 750874 Bouvetøya is one of the most<br />isolated places in the world.
750959 754920 The nearest land is a thousand miles away.<br />There's no help if we run into trouble.
755004 757047 You're right.<br />It's a no-man's-land.
757131 759049 But the train has left the station.
760385 763387 And I think I speak for<br />everyone aboard this ship.
763471 766265 This is worth the risk.
773273 775399 <i>(Sighs)</i>
775483 777401 Find another guide.
787370 792708 <i>(Woman on P.A.) Hydraulic Team 3<br />report for safety check on Deck B4.</i>
794836 798839 I've spoken with Mr. Weyland. The money's<br />been wired to your foundation's account.
798923 801383 Chopper's refueling<br />to fly you home.
803261 807014 - Who'd you get?<br />- <i>(Womanon P.A.) O.C.R. team in 1300 hours.</i>
807098 809099 Gerald Murdoch.
812186 815731 - Come in.<br />- Gerry Murdoch has two seasons of ice time. He's not ready.
817442 820444 - Don't worry about it.<br />- What about Paul Woodman or Andrew Keeler?
820528 822321 - We called 'em.<br />- And?
822405 824990 - They gave the same bullshit answer you did.<br />- Bullshit?
826326 829703 Mr. Weyland,<br />what I told you wasn't bullshit.
829787 832122 If you rush this,<br />people will get hurt.
832206 834625 - Maybe die.<br />- I don't understand your objections, Miss Woods.
834709 836627 We're not asking you<br />to take us up Everest.
836711 840672 We need you take us from the ship to the<br />pyramid and then back to the ship. That's it.
840757 842925 And what about inside the pyramid?
843009 845302 You don't have to worry about that.<br />Once we're on the site...
845386 848221 we have the best equipment, technology<br />and experts that money can buy.
848306 850766 - Is this new?<br />- It's the latest.
850850 852768 Mr. Weyland,<br />when I lead my team...
852852 855729 I don't ever leave my team.
855813 857814 I admire your passion.
858942 862152 I wish you were going with us.
862236 864196 You're making a mistake.
864280 866782 <i>(Ice cracking)</i>
871120 873622 Ah, it's in the upper atmosphere.
875583 878502 Streams of protons<br />and electrons from the sun...
878586 882255 being deflected by the Earth's magnetic field,<br />causing a solar radiation storm.
882340 887928 Shackleton called Antarctica<br />the last great journey left to man.
888012 891974 It's the one place left in the world<br />that no one owns.
892058 894184 It's completely free.
896270 899856 Me— I'm sort of partial<br />to the penguins.
899941 901900 <i>(Chuckles)</i>
903152 906446 I wish you'd reconsider<br />coming with us, Lex.
906531 910283 Come on. Don't make me pull out<br />pictures of my kids again.
910368 913120 Your kids aren't that cute.
913204 915497 What if we got pictures<br />of other people's kids?
917375 919960 - Want my advice?<br />- Mm-hmm.
920044 921878 Stay on the boat.
923256 926299 <i>(Sebastian) Okay.<br />Let me ask you something.</i>
926384 929219 Do we stand a better chance<br />of surviving with you...
929303 932055 or with the number two choice?
933558 935350 - <i>(Door opens)</i><br />- <i>(Woman) Miss Woods.</i>
935435 939021 Your helicopter is refueled.<br />They're waiting for you.
1000792 1002793 <i>(Men chattering)</i>
1005213 1008173 Everybody listen up!
1008257 1010175 Gather round.
1010259 1012552 - Told you she'd stay.<br />- Gentlemen.
1012637 1014638 She can't resist my animal magnetism.
1014722 1017307 Laugh it up, Miller.<br />Laugh it up.
1017391 1018975 Gentlemen.
1020645 1024231 It is my job to keep you alive<br />on this expedition.
1024315 1026233 And I need your help to do that.
1026317 1031113 Since I don't have time to properly train<br />you, I'm laying down three simple rules.
1031197 1035325 One: No one goes<br />anywhere alone... ever.
1036327 1038537 Two...
1038621 1043166 Everyone must maintain<br />constant communication.
1043251 1046837 Three: Unexpected things<br />are gonna happen.
1046921 1050757 When they do, no one tries<br />to be a hero.
1050842 1053218 - Understood?<br />- Mm-hmm.
1054428 1057347 - Understood?<br />- Yes, ma'am.
1057431 1058890 Good.
1063855 1067732 Seven seasons on the ice, and<br />I've never seen a gun save someone's life.
1067817 1070527 - I don't plan on using it.<br />- Then why bring it?
1071654 1073989 The same principle as a condom.
1074073 1076074 I'd rather have one<br />and not need it...
1076159 1078410 than need it and not have one.
1078494 1081746 I'm glad that you decided to stay.
1084083 1086001 Move the trucks out on the ice.
1086085 1088044 - <i>(Truck beeping)</i><br />- Move that.
1088129 1090046 Hey, let's go.
1103436 1106396 - <i>(Lex) What's with the bottle cap?</i><br />- What?
1106480 1108190 What's with the bottle cap?
1109233 1111151 Oh.
1111235 1114237 This is a—<br />a valuable archeological find.
1122205 1124331 When I was a kid<br />growing up in Italy...
1124415 1127417 - you know what they call a moon that big?<br />- Hmm?
1127501 1130212 <i>La luna del cacciatore.</i>
1130296 1134174 <i>"La luna del cacciatore."</i>
1134258 1136801 - <i>Brava.</i><br />- What's that?
1136886 1139304 Hunter's moon.
1139388 1142682 - "Hunter's moon."<br />- Mm-hmm.
1142767 1144809 Hmm.
1158741 1160825 <i>(Quinn) Hold it, guys.</i>
1162787 1165330 <i>(Man whistles)</i><br />Keep those engines runnin'!
1165414 1167958 <i>(Man #2) Set it down.</i>
1168042 1170126 <i>(Quinn) Hey.<br />Move up a little further.</i>
1170211 1172212 <i>(Quinn) Connors.</i>
1189772 1192232 It's an abandoned whaling station.
1192316 1194567 According to your satellite imagery,<br />Mr. Weyland...
1194652 1197028 the pyramid is located<br />directly beneath it.
1211752 1214087 All right. Bring it up.<br />Come on. Come on.
1214171 1216047 <i>(Man) Spread out.</i>
1217591 1219926 We'll use this place<br />as a base camp.
1220011 1222929 Mr. Quinn, begin drilling<br />operations as soon as you can.
1223014 1226391 I'm on it. Okay, guys.<br />Let's move out.
1260593 1261843 <i>(Gasps)</i>
1270269 1272687 - What are these?<br />- Whale bones.
1275649 1278193 <i>(Lex) This station was<br />abandoned in 1904.</i>
1278277 1280737 Everyone just disappeared overnight.

1411827 1413745 What is it?
1415331 1417415 Can you believe that?
1425716 1429093 It's drilled at a pefrect<br />30 degree angle.
1430471 1434432 - How far does it go down?<br />- All the way to the pyramid.
1434517 1436935 There it is.<br />Clear as day.
1437019 1439812 And the same time yesterday.
1439897 1442524 - Nothing.<br />- How was it done?
1442608 1444567 Thermal equipment of some kind.
1444652 1447570 Like yours?
1447655 1450406 More advanced.<br />Incredibly powerful.
1452201 1455537 I've never seen anything like it.
1455621 1458790 I'm telling you. There's no team<br />and no machine in the world...
1458874 1461292 that could cut to this depth<br />in 24 hours.
1461377 1463503 Well, the only way<br />we're gonna know for sure...
1463587 1465588 is to get down there and find out.
1489363 1491781 Look at that.<br />Change it now!
1492866 1495868 Okay, guys.<br />What's taking so long?
1495953 1497231 There's a storm coming.
1497431 1499831 <i>(Man) Come on! Pack 'em<br />and stack 'em! Get 'em inside!</i>
1501292 1503418 <i>(Coughing)</i>
1506797 1510383 There's no room for sick men<br />on this expedition.
1510467 1512719 My doctors tell me the worst<br />is behind me.
1512803 1515430 You're not a very good liar,<br />Mr. Weyland.
1515514 1518391 Stay on the ship. We'll update you<br />at the top of every hour.
1518475 1520727 You know, when you get sick...
1520811 1523563 you think about your life<br />and how you're gonna be remembered.
1523647 1526316 You know what I realize<br />will happen when I go?
1526400 1529193 Ten percent fall in share prices.<br />Maybe 12.
1529278 1533323 - That's it.<br />- I've heard this speech before.
1534825 1538828 My dad broke his leg 700 feet<br />from the summit of Mt. Rainier.
1538912 1542749 He was like you.<br />He wouldn't go back or let us stop.
1542833 1545126 We reached the top...
1545210 1547337 and he opened a bottle<br />of champagne.
1549381 1554260 I had my first drink<br />with my dad at 14,400 feet.
1554345 1558681 On the way down he developed a blood clot<br />in his leg that traveled to his lung.
1558766 1564145 He suffered for four hours before<br />dying 20 minutes from the base.
1565689 1569692 You think that's the last thing<br />your dad remembers? The pain?
1569777 1574364 Or drinking champagne with his daughter<br />14,000 feet in the air?
1577743 1579702 I need this.

1820527 1823404 Congratulations, Mr. Weyland.
1823488 1826282 Looks like you'll be leaving<br />your mark after all.
1830454 1833080 Thank you. Thank you.
1833165 1835291 Thank you all for this.

1967466 1970092 Thomas.
1970177 1972303 What is it?
1973513 1975431 I recognize the Egyptian.
1975515 1978434 The second symbol is Aztec.<br />Preconquest era.
1978518 1981479 The third is Cambodian.
1981563 1984940 Then you were right. The pyramid<br />contains all three cultures.
1985025 1987443 That's what it looks like.
1987527 1990905 "You may... choose...
1990989 1993449 to enter."
1993533 1995659 "Those who choose may enter."
1995744 1998204 Who taught you to translate?
1998288 2001123 Funny. Kind of looked like you.
2002793 2005461 Well, it's not "choose."
2005545 2007588 It's "chosen."
2007672 2010716 "Only the chosen ones may enter."

2186685 2189228 <i>(Sebastian) This is<br />the sacrificial chamber.</i>
2194359 2196944 <i>(Thomas) Just like<br />the Aztecs and the Egyptians.</i>
2197028 2199530 Whoever built this pyramid<br />believed in ritual sacrifice.
2202200 2205035 This is where the chosen ones<br />were offered to the gods.
2214754 2218966 Those that were chosen<br />would lie here.
2219050 2221510 They weren't bound<br />or tied in any way.
2221594 2224304 They went to die willingly.
2224389 2226890 Men and women.
2228518 2230769 It was considered an honor.
2232439 2235065 Lucky them.
2237736 2239737 <i>(Chuckles)</i>
2239821 2241780 Oh, God.
2241865 2243866 It's incredible.
2243950 2248287 The entire skull and spinal<br />column's removed in one piece.
2249289 2251248 Look at this.
2251332 2254501 Look at that.<br />The cleanness of the cut.
2254586 2258255 Straight through the bone.<br />There's no abrasions, nothing.
2260759 2264261 <i>(Faint screaming)</i>
2270685 2274188 It's probably just the air<br />moving through the tunnels.
2275565 2277524 Maybe.
2313103 2314770 <i>(Gasps)</i>
2321861 2324696 <i>(Miller) Whatever this is,<br />it's been dead a while.</i>
2324781 2327407 The bones have completely calcified.
2327492 2331328 No idea how long it's been here, but<br />the temperature has kept it preserved.
2331412 2334081 Looks like some kind of scorpion.
2334165 2337501 No. Climate's too hostile<br />for a scorpion.
2337585 2338961 Ever seen anything like it?
2348930 2351515 <i>(Thomas) "They gave their lives...</i>
2351599 2354101 <i>so the hunt could begin."</i>
2365738 2367739 What happened here?
2367824 2371410 It's common in ritual sacrifice<br />to take the heart of the victim.
2371494 2373829 That's nice.
2373913 2376415 But that's not where your heart is.
2378042 2381044 Besides, it looks like the bones<br />were bent straight out.
2383631 2385382 Something broke out of this body.
2388052 2423795 <i>(Screeching)</i>
2439562 2441772 <i>(Weyland) What have<br />you found, Max?</i>
2441856 2444733 <i>(Max) It's a shaft<br />to another level.</i>
2444817 2447527 Looks like there's<br />another room down there.

2521853 2523854 <i>(Lex) Sebastian.</i>
2529861 2531862 It's a sarcophagus.

2538536 2541538 This is the Aztec calendar.
2541622 2544666 And this... It's some kind of<br />combination lock.
2546919 2549421 Days.
2550506 2554259 Months. Years.
2555428 2558055 The dials are set for...
2561976 2563894 1904.
2565021 2567397 Someone opened this<br />a hundred years ago?
2567482 2569566 What's today's date?
2569650 2573653 - October 10.<br />- 10/10/2004.

2647436 2649354 No.
2649438 2651273 You?
2651357 2653775 - <i>(Miller) No.</i><br />- It's a good thing we brought the experts.
2653860 2655569 Well, yeah. It is a good thing.

2674172 2676965 <i>(Lex) Okay. We've, uh...<br />We've been out long enough for today.</i>
2677049 2679676 We're gonna set up base camp tonight<br />at the whaling station...
2679760 2681511 and get back at it<br />first thing tomorrow.
2681596 2685265 Well, you can go back to the base camp,<br />Miss Woods, but, uh, we're staying here.
2685349 2687559 No.
2687643 2689686 You wanted to leave<br />without proper prep. We did.
2689770 2692439 You wanted to be<br />the first ones here. We are.
2692523 2695317 You've claimed the find.<br />It's yours.
2695401 2698862 Now, we move as a team,<br />and we're done for the day.
2698946 2701698 You heard her.
2701782 2704743 - What do you want to do with these, Mr. Weyland?<br />- Take them.
2704827 2706995 We'll run further tests<br />on the surface.
2707079 2708955 No. No!
2709040 2711541 Don't touch them.
2711626 2714753 <i>(Loud rumbling)</i>

2732813 2734564 What's going on?
2737026 2739569 - <i>(Man) Look out.</i><br />- <i>(Rumbling)</i>
2748162 2750830 - <i>(Man in distance)</i> See if you can stop it.<br />- You okay?
2750915 2752916 - Yeah.<br />- <i>(Man) There must be another way out.</i>

2821235 2823153 - <i>(Lex) Rousseau!</i><br />- Tommy, come in.
2823237 2825196 - <i>(Lex) Is there anything you didn't tell me?</i><br />- Nothing.
2825281 2827324 Your guess is as good as mine.
2827408 2829367 Well, whatever it is,<br />we're not prepared for it.
2829452 2833330 We're gonna round up the rest of the team<br />and get to the surface. Let's move!
2835583 2838418 What are you doing?
2838502 2840462 My job.
2840546 2841833 Yours is over.
2841933 2845133 My job is over when everyone<br />is back on the boat safely.
2845217 2848219 And that gun doesn't change anything.
2861609 2864944 This bearing should take us back<br />to the entrance...
2865029 2867113 and we'll regroup<br />at the whaling station.
2867198 2870075 <i>(Sebastian) What about Thomas?<br />Rousseau?</i>
2870159 2872744 - We'll find them on the way up.<br />- <i>(Weyland) Max.</i>
2872828 2875038 <i>(Max) Stone, Verheiden,<br />cover our backs.</i>
2875122 2878875 The heat bloom that your satellite detected<br />makes a lot more sense now, Mr. Weyland.
2878959 2882337 - What do you mean?<br />- Well, a building this sophisticated...
2882421 2883963 would require a major energy source.
2884048 2885757 I think that's what<br />your satellite detected.
2885841 2889302 A power plant for<br />this pyramid firing up.
2889387 2891221 - Preparing.<br />- Preparing?

3002458 3004709 We worshipped these things?
3004793 3006586 According to this, we did.
3006670 3011007 And the artifacts you removed<br />from the sarcophagus...
3011091 3013593 seem to be their weapons.
3013677 3015053 Hmm.
3016931 3019807 Let's keep moving.<br />Only another 200 yards to the entrance.
3042039 3043623 - <i>(Max) Take cover.</i><br />- Move! Move!

3810098 3812683 You have to slow<br />your breathing down.
3812767 3815227 Slow, steady breaths.
3820734 3822651 - Weyland, come on.<br />- I can hardly stand.
3822736 3825571 Weyland, I'm not gonna<br />let you die down here.

4027315 4029650 Look over here.
4057095 4061390 - He's marking himself.<br />- What?
4061474 4065644 Ancient warriors would mark themselves<br />with the blood of their kill.
4065728 4067979 It's a rite of passage.
4072193 4074695 This is starting to make sense.
4082412 4087499 I think this is a manhood ritual.
4087583 4091253 The humanoid ones,<br />they've been sent here...
4091337 4094339 to prove that they're<br />worthy to become adults.
4095758 4101221 You're saying they're, what, teenagers?
4104684 4107978 That's why they didn't carry<br />those guns with them to begin with.
4108062 4110188 They have to earn them.
4122034 4125036 The hieroglyphs are<br />a little difficult to make out...
4125121 4127873 but the story's all here.
4130042 4135714 Thousands of years ago, these hunters<br />found a backwater planet.
4139218 4142512 <i>(Chanting in ancient language)</i>
4142597 4148101 They taught humans how to build<br />and were worshipped as gods.
4152774 4155942 Every hundred years,<br />the gods would return.
4159280 4164743 And when they did,<br />they would expect a sacrifice.
4164744 4169080 Humans were used to breed<br />the ultimate prey.
4172251 4176546 <i>(Roars)</i>
4176631 4180217 The hunters would battle<br />with these great serpents...
4180301 4184304 to prove themselves worthy<br />to carry the mark.
4199737 4202906 - <i>(Beeping)</i><br />- But if the hunters lost...
4202990 4205992 they made sure nothing survived.
4210665 4214000 An entire civilization<br />wiped out overnight.
4217547 4222384 So, the humanoids, the hunters...
4222468 4225053 they brought those creatures<br />here to hunt?
4225137 4227222 And they use us like cattle.
4227306 4231017 We're hosts for them to breed in.
4231102 4236398 The heat bloom was designed to lure us<br />down here. This whole thing was a trap.
4238359 4242028 Without us, there could be no hunt.

4262884 4265719 <i>(Straining)</i>
4270725 4273935 Shoot it! Verheiden!
4293247 4297250 <i>(Breathes heavily)</i>
4314727 4316019 Oh, shit.
4316103 4319606 - <i>(Gunfire)</i><br />- <i>(Screams)</i>
4321192 4323985 When that door opens, we're dead.
4324070 4327364 - Not if we set things right.<br />- What do you mean?
4327448 4331618 This pyramid, it's like a prison.
4331702 4335413 We took the guards' guns,<br />and now the prisoners are running free.
4335498 4339000 To restore order,<br />the guards need their guns.
4341003 4345674 When that door opens, we're gonna<br />give that thing his gun back.
4345758 4348385 Are you crazy?<br />During a big game hunt...
4348469 4350553 the animals being hunted<br />don't arm the hunters.
4350638 4354140 They're not hunting us.<br />We're in the middle of a war.
4354225 4357727 - It's time to pick a side.<br />- We are on our side.
4359355 4363483 We have to consider the possibility<br />we might not make it out of here.
4366112 4370448 But we have to make sure those serpents<br />don't reach the surface.
4370533 4373451 Because if they do...
4373536 4376621 everything everywhere could die.
4380793 4385839 The enemy of my enemy...<br />is my friend.
