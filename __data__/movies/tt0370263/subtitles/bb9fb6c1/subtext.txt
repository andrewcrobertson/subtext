26526 30030 Antarctica<br />October 10th, 1904
214413 215896 Lunch.
226036 228172 Come here.<br />Take a look at this.
230732 231626 What is it?
231661 233657 - It's a data stream from PS12.
234024 234897 - Where is she?
235163 236817 - Right above sector 14.
238172 240008 There isn't anything in sector 14.
240259 241491 There is now.
271926 273869 - Hello?<br />- Miss Woods.
273938 275385 Pleasure to make your acquaintance.
275568 276530 - Who is this?
276654 280492 - My name's Maxwell Stafford.<br />I represent Weyland Industries.
281810 283327 - Let me guess.<br />He's suing us again?
284310 285153 - You misunderstand.
285290 289503 Mr Weyland has offered to fund your<br />foundation for a year,
289690 290893 if you'll meet with him.
291505 293864 When?<br />Tomorrow.
294655 296249 Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.
297966 299945 Take me a week to get back to the world.
300246 302636 Yes, I told Mr Weyland that.
303698 306385 He said he didn't have a week.
323142 324881 We must be right on top of it.
346757 348299 What is it, Sebastian?
362969 364929 Early 1950s, I'd say.
365987 368100 Hey, Juan, we're almost there!
368101 372708 According to you, the Teotihuacans' final gift<br />to their dying king...
372742 373972 was a Pepsi.
374084 375751 - Come on, give me one more month.<br />- No.
375752 378054 - Please.<br />- I'm bringing another team.
379286 380710 What?
381662 384236 Without a crew<br />and a permit we're out of business.
384940 386823 Hold the team together for two days.
386944 389791 I'll go to Mexico City and I'll talk to the bank.
390000 391619 I'll get us more money.
392298 394899 I might be able to help you<br />accomplish that, Professor.
396941 397838 Do I know you?
399800 403013 In exchange for a little of your time.
427791 428757 Oh, I'm sorry.
429249 431003 I should've switched the flash off.
431482 432573 There's your magazine.
433584 435157 Excuse me.<br />That's OK.
436140 438189 I'm documenting the trip for my boys.<br />This is them.
438653 441846 Jacob and Scotty.
442632 444638 Would you mind taking a picture?<br />Thank you.
445167 447891 Just wanna show them<br />that their dad wasn't always so boring.
449229 450806 - Smile.<br />- OK.
453460 455232 - There you go.<br />- Thank you.
456173 457239 I'm Graeme Miller.
457274 458633 I'm a chemical engineer.
459280 461680 Alexa Woods,<br />environmental technician and guide.
462443 464231 - Do you work for Weyland?
464266 465119 - Oh, no.
467037 469809 No, I split my time between working<br />for a small environmental group
469844 472835 and taking scientists<br />on expeditions on the ice.
473299 476499 Lex. Buckle up.<br />We're gonna hit some turbulence.
476534 477799 Thanks, Jack.
479458 480574 - Is he a friend of yours?
480609 484293 - Of my dad's.<br />He trained most of the pilots here.
484328 485407 - Just passed the PSR.
485442 487720 - Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.
488369 490915 - Of what?<br />- The PSR.
490950 493069 I wish he'd called it out before we passed it.
495200 498227 The PSR is the point of safe return.
498262 501442 It means we've used up half our fuel,<br />so we can't turn back.
503400 505261 Right, but if something went wrong,
505296 508731 we could land, presumably.
508889 511108 - We could ditch.<br />- Yeah. Ditch.
511143 513734 But the temperature of the water<br />would kill us in three minutes.
534131 536546 - Weyland's check cleared.<br />- Good.
537483 540199 You know what?<br />We're gonna listen to whatever he has to say.
540631 544408 We nod, we smile and we politely<br />decline whatever offer he makes.
545005 547062 Take the money and we'll<br />head back to Mexico.
547063 548543 Right.
560214 561239 Havin' fun?
561240 563811 Yeah! This is quite an adventure!
563812 565412 Listen, my kids are not gonna<br />to believe this...
565413 566413 but would you make a picture?
567728 570056 You have to hold like that<br />until it flashes.
570057 570893 You're kidding.
571309 573691 Get off! Or you'll be<br />wearing your ass for a hat!
573692 577199 Alright. OK.<br />Sure.
577493 579198 Nice team spirit.
580448 582439 Keep the beakers<br />away from the gear.
586467 587943 What does he mean - 'beaker'?
588282 590255 It's what they call scientists up here.
591074 593046 You know "beaker",<br />like in the muppet show.
593047 596848 Everybody. Please, your attention.
602573 605794 Mr Weyland.
617176 619094 Seven days ago,
619162 622047 one of my satellites<br />over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits
622187 624468 discovered a sudden heat bloom<br />beneath the earth,
625065 627025 which outlined this.
627480 630009 The red lines indicate solid walls.
630762 632030 Through thermal mapping,
632065 635304 we've generated<br />a three-dimensional image of the structure.
636904 640259 It's massive,<br />containing hundreds of rooms,
640294 642729 all built around a central core.
643978 646497 My experts tell me it's a pyramid.
647977 651432 What they can't agree on<br />is who built it and when.
651840 655734 One expert tells me this has features<br />reminiscent of the Aztecs.
656486 658657 Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.
658692 660247 What they all agree on is that
660282 663191 the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.
663226 664985 - I think your experts are right.
665020 667748 - Which one?<br />- All of them.
667825 669278 - Meaning what, exactly?
671498 674799 This pyramid contains<br />the features of all three cultures.
676966 679363 This might be the first pyramid ever built.
679943 681245 - But built by whom?
681671 683340 - By the first civilisation.
686215 687304 Thank you.
688412 691502 But how could anyone possibly<br />build a pyramid out here?
691537 693565 Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.
694494 696898 - It's likely the continent was once habitable.
697935 699538 - I can't tell you who built it.
699573 703209 But if I could take a sample from it,<br />I can tell you how old it is.
703244 706290 Dr Miller, I'm offering<br />to put you right next to this thing.
707957 709452 - What caused the heat bloom?
709487 710535 - I don't know.
710570 712518 - Where exactly on the ice is this?
712884 714500 - Bouvetoya Island.
714535 718278 But it's not on the ice.<br />It's 2,000ft below it.
721346 722401 - Mr Quinn?
722744 725903 - Mr Stafford.<br />You're looking at the best drilling team in the world.
726550 728645 We'll chew to that depth in seven days.
728646 731857 Add three weeks on top of that<br />to train everyone here.
731892 734867 We don't have that kind of time, Ms Woods.
734902 737518 I'm not the only one<br />with a satellite over Antarctica.
738067 740072 Others will be here soon.
740724 742254 Maybe I wasn't clear.
742785 745056 No one in this room is ready for this trip.
745114 746806 That's why I asked you here.
747706 750881 Bouvetoya is one of the world's<br />most isolated places.
751055 752596 The nearest land is 1,000 miles away.
752747 754163 - There's no help if we run into trouble.
754305 756039 - You're right. It's a no-man's-land.
757459 759253 But the train has left the station.
760367 762775 And I think I speak<br />for everyone aboard this ship.
764624 766719 This is worth the risk.
775890 778797 Find another guide.
794969 798460 I've spoken with Mr Weyland.<br />Money's been wired to your account.
798955 801328 Chopper's refuelling to fly you home.
803741 804899 Who'd you get?
807155 808542 Gerald Murdoch.
812490 813490 - Come in.
813495 816201 - Murdoch has two seasons of ice time.<br />He's not ready.
817324 818446 - Don't worry about it.
818447 820360 - What about Paul Woodman?
820361 821437 - We called him.<br />- And?
821472 823665 - He gave the same bullshit answer you did.
823974 825197 "Bullshit"?
826707 828946 What I told you in there wasn't bullshit.
829081 830862 If you rush this, people will get hurt.
832193 832895 Maybe die.
833246 836556 I don't understand.<br />We're not asking you to take us up Everest.
836884 839658 We need you to take us from the ship<br />to the pyramid,
839693 841535 and back. That's it.
841570 843082 - What about inside the pyramid?
843117 844594 - Don't worry about that.
844634 848103 Once we're on the site, we have the best<br />technology and experts
848138 849250 that money can buy.
849285 850794 - Is this new?<br />- It's the latest.
850835 855445 Mr Weyland, when I lead my team<br />I don't ever leave my team.
855480 858138 I admire your passion.
859198 862257 I wish you were going with us.
862292 865358 You're making a mistake.
871854 874977 It's in the upper atmosphere.
875954 878731 Streams of protons<br />and electrons from the sun
878766 883451 being deflected by the earth's magnetic<br />field, causing a solar radiation storm.
883725 888020 Shackleton called Antarctica<br />"the last great journey left to man".
888723 891769 It's the one place left in the world<br />that no one owns.
892667 895830 It's completely free.
896221 897392 Me,
897940 900008 I'm sort of partial to the penguins.
902586 906491 I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex.
906609 909654 Come on, don't make me pull out<br />pictures of my kids again.
910474 912427 Your kids aren't that cute.
912465 915473 What if we got pictures<br />of other people's kids?
917525 919495 Want my advice?
920433 922268 Stay on the boat.
923163 924259 OK.
925025 926213 Let me ask you something.
927204 929179 Do we stand a better chance<br />of surviving with you
930305 932382 or with the number-two choice?
934295 937186 Miss Woods, your helicopter's refuelled.
937224 940270 They're waiting for you.
1005681 1007241 Everybody, listen up!
1008234 1010289 Gather round.
1011130 1012088 Told you she'd stay.
1012670 1014659 She can't resist my animal magnetism.
1015383 1017501 Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.
1017645 1018714 Gentlemen?
1020949 1023918 It is my job to keep you alive<br />on this expedition,
1024897 1026422 and I need your help to do that.
1027360 1029066 Since I don't have time to properly train you,
1029206 1031502 I'm laying down three rules.
1031537 1034241 One. No one goes anywhere alone.
1034276 1035454 Ever.
1036296 1037529 Two:
1038650 1042378 Everyone must maintain<br />constant communication.
1043220 1044313 Three:
1044348 1047634 Unexpected things are gonna happen.<br />When they do ...
1048220 1049581 no one tries to be a hero.
1051114 1052376 Understood?
1054793 1056418 Understood?
1056453 1058600 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Good.
1064032 1067843 Seven seasons on the ice<br />and I've never seen a gun save someone's life.
1068223 1069639 - I don't plan on using it.
1069688 1070831 - Then why bring it?
1071875 1073356 Same principle as a condom.
1074257 1075766 I'd rather have one and not need it
1075801 1078273 than need it and not have one.
1079631 1082020 I'm glad that you decided to stay.
1084177 1086129 Move the trucks out on the ice.
1104164 1105412 - What's with the bottle cap?
1105887 1106722 What?
1106757 1107988 What's with the bottle cap?
1111005 1114346 This is a valuable archaeological find.
1122231 1124174 When I was a kid<br />growing up in Italy,
1124677 1126762 you know what they call a moon that big?
1128190 1130547 La luna del cacciatore.
1131675 1134354 La luna del cacciatore.
1134488 1135350 Brava.
1136450 1137533 - What's that?
1137733 1139360 - Hunter's moon.
1140015 1141221 Hunter's moon.
1159791 1160865 Hold it, guys.
1163823 1165361 - Keep those engines running!
1165450 1166730 - Set it down.
1168700 1171185 Move over a little further. Connors.
1190300 1192852 It's an abandoned whaling station.
1192853 1193853 All right, bring it up. Come on.
1192990 1198021 According to your satellite imagery,<br />the pyramid is located directly beneath it.
1212022 1216618 All right, bring it up. Come on.<br />Spread out.
1217539 1219337 We'll use this place as a base camp.
1219883 1220777 Mr Quinn,
1220959 1223178 begin drilling operations as soon as you can.
1223331 1224351 I'm on it.
1224611 1226436 OK, guys, let's move out.
1270326 1271392 - What are these?
1271534 1272620 - Whale bones.
1275721 1278098 This station was abandoned in 1904.
1278335 1280326 Everyone just disappeared overnight.
1281169 1283196 It was a big mystery back then.
1334500 1336728 One for National Geographic.
1380750 1381557 - Lex.
1381708 1384377 - No one goes anywhere alone.
1384841 1387596 There's something there. Listen. Listen.
1395622 1397335 Careful. They bite.
1409811 1413405 Over here. Over here.<br />What is it?
1415504 1416807 Can you believe that?
1426445 1428780 It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.
1430237 1431602 - How far does it go down?
1432067 1433564 - All the way to the pyramid.
1434714 1436401 There it is. Clear as day.
1436783 1438474 And the same time yesterday...
1439873 1440848 - Nothing.
1440982 1442177 - How was it done?
1442901 1444608 - Thermal equipment of some kind.
1444783 1445858 - Like yours?
1447568 1448710 More advanced.
1449304 1450829 Incredibly powerful.
1453016 1454627 I've never seen anything like it.
1455597 1458347 There's no team and no machine in the world
1458473 1460663 that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.
1461303 1463179 Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure
1463666 1465919 is to get down there and find out.
1490322 1492030 Look at that. Change it. Now!
1493496 1495244 OK, guys, what's taking so long?
1495245 1497137 There's a storm coming.
1507241 1509698 There's no room for sick men<br />on this expedition.
1510452 1512001 - My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.
1512432 1514698 - You're not a very good liar, Mr Weyland.
1515550 1518490 Stay on the ship.<br />We'll update you at the top of every hour.
1519474 1520656 When you get sick,
1521396 1523678 you think about your life<br />and how you're gonna be remembered.
1524222 1526177 You know what will happen when I go?
1526258 1529303 Ten per cent fall in share prices.<br />Maybe twelve.
1529893 1531112 That's it.
1531516 1533263 I've heard this speech before.
1534712 1539257 My dad broke his leg<br />700ft from the summit of Mount Rainier.
1539405 1540637 He was like you.
1540860 1542655 He wouldn't go back or let us stop.
1543468 1547257 We reached the top,<br />and he opened a bottle of champagne.
1549596 1553630 I had my first drink with my dad<br />at 14,400ft.
1555185 1559139 On the way down, he developed a blood clot<br />in his leg that travelled to his lung.
1559803 1563978 He suffered for four hours<br />before dying 20 minutes from the base.
1565602 1567786 You think that's the last thing<br />your dad remembers?
1568264 1569341 The pain?
1570565 1574867 Or drinking champagne<br />with his daughter 14,000ft in the air?
1578164 1579370 I need this.
1636844 1637836 Shit.
1643012 1644609 Mr Weyland!
1644901 1646047 Man down!
1647224 1647941 Get him!
1647976 1649436 Somebody get him!
1673685 1675948 Move it!<br />Now!
1767107 1767958 I don't understand it.
1768943 1770107 No equipment.
1770618 1772204 No sign of another team.
1774799 1776713 Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.
1779589 1780490 Move it.
1780745 1783022 Connors, get those lights up.
1783622 1785002 We have power.
1820876 1823024 Congratulations, Mr Weyland.
1823584 1826133 Looks like you'll be<br />leaving your mark after all.
1830478 1831543 Thank you.
1832105 1832933 Thank you.
1833445 1834974 Thank you all for this.
1837330 1838839 Let's make history.
1967543 1968445 Thomas.
1970717 1971937 What is it?
1974029 1975489 - I recognise the Egyptian...
1975621 1977355 - The second symbol is Aztec.
1977735 1978946 Pre-conquest era.
1979432 1981139 The third is Cambodian.
1981448 1982357 Then you were right.
1982783 1984866 The pyramid contains all three cultures.
1985263 1986636 - That's what it looks like.
1987465 1989119 - "You may...
1989225 1990766 ...choose...
1991180 1992288 ...to enter."
1992983 1995154 "Those who choose may enter."
1995973 1997383 Who taught you to translate?
1998364 2000630 Funny. Kinda looked like you.
2002784 2005346 Well, it's not "choose".
2006161 2007660 It's "chosen".
2008494 2010987 "Only the chosen ones may enter."
2031292 2033228 Quinn, is that you out there?
2079389 2080937 Mikkel.
2184111 2185893 What is all this?
2186950 2189184 This is the sacrificial chamber.
2194433 2196736 Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.
2196989 2198042 Whoever built this pyramid
2198045 2200031 believed in ritual sacrifice.
2202084 2204418 This is where the chosen ones<br />were offered to the gods.
2215559 2217836 Those that were chosen would lie here.
2219298 2221305 They weren't bound or tied in any way.
2222379 2224166 They went to die willingly.
2224917 2226353 Men and women.
2228924 2230692 It was considered an honour.
2232747 2233782 Lucky them.
2239610 2240806 Oh, god.
2242360 2243811 It's incredible.
2243812 2247620 The entire skull and spinal column<br />were removed in one piece.
2249304 2250543 Look at this.
2251356 2253344 Look at them.<br />The cleanness of the cut.
2254495 2255985 Straight through the bone.
2255986 2258019 There's no abrasions, nothing.
2270789 2273438 It's probably just the wind,<br />moving through the tunnels.
2275548 2276641 Come here.
2322393 2324590 Whatever this is,<br />it's been dead awhile.
2324625 2327033 The bones have<br />completely calcified.
2327034 2328446 No idea how long<br />it's been here but...
2328564 2330414 the temperature has<br />kept it preserved.
2331747 2333897 It looks like some kind of scorpion.
2333898 2336969 No, climate is too<br />hostile for a scorpion
2337419 2338982 Have you seen anything like it?
2349376 2351347 "They gave their lives
2351635 2352664 so the hunt
2353086 2354089 could begin."
2366052 2367410 What happened here?
2368303 2371590 It's common in ritual sacrifice<br />to take the heart of the victim.
2372018 2373128 That's nice.
2374238 2375751 But that's not where your heart is.
2378198 2381272 Besides, it looks like the bones<br />were bent straight out.
2383527 2385802 Something broke out of this body.
2439533 2441121 - What have you found, Max?
2441768 2443613 - It's a shaft to another level.
2445462 2447560 Looks like there's another room down there.
2473020 2474904 - Let's move to that lower room.
2475282 2476784 - We're moving on, everyone.
2477843 2479089 Ms Woods.
2481400 2482137 You.
2482269 2485078 Stay here. Rousseau, you stay with him.<br />Keep a team with you.
2485508 2486867 Catalogue everything.
2488648 2489948 Professor.
2509638 2512491 This should be directly below<br />the sacrificial chamber.
2521960 2523236 Sebastian.
2530367 2532122 It's a sarcophagus.
2535807 2537780 This is the Long Count.
2539264 2541241 This is the Aztec calendar.
2541829 2542560 And this...
2542596 2544712 it's some kind of combination lock.
2547597 2548686 Days.
2550520 2551773 Months.
2552484 2553768 Years.
2555596 2556867 The dials are set for...
2562670 2564460 1904.
2565006 2566905 Someone opened this 100 years ago?
2568358 2569277 - What's today's date?
2569916 2571196 - October 10.
2571318 2573789 10/10/2004.
2576451 2577894 - Are you sure this is gonna work?
2578372 2579285 - I don't know.
2594393 2595493 Back up!
2617396 2618477 Oh, my God.
2618512 2619923 Take a look at this.
2646180 2647518 - Any idea what these are?
2648100 2649377 No.
2649527 2650361 You?
2651200 2652036 No.
2652064 2654017 - It's a good thing we brought the experts.
2654277 2656098 - Well, yeah. It is a good thing.
2656368 2659409 Cos this is like finding<br />Moses' DVD collection.
2665565 2666347 Weyland?
2669993 2671858 A little too much excitement.
2674393 2677836 We've been out long enough for today.<br />We'll set up
2677871 2680662 base camp at the whaling station<br />and get back at it tomorrow morning.
2681312 2684900 Well, you can go back to the base camp,<br />Ms Woods, but we're staying here.
2685460 2686360 No.
2686989 2688388 You wanted to leave<br />without proper prep.
2688423 2689175 We did.
2689210 2690840 You wanted to be the first here.
2690875 2691708 We are.
2691901 2694112 You've claimed the find. It's yours.
2694909 2697689 Now, we move as a team,<br />and we're done for the day.
2699303 2700475 You heard her.
2702280 2703734 - What do you wanna do with these?
2703858 2704689 Take them.
2705182 2706837 We'll run further tests on the surface.
2707374 2708636 No. No!
2708918 2709899 Don't touch them.
2725670 2726508 - Watch out!
2726948 2727847 - The doors!
2728865 2729734 - The door!
2750235 2751570 - You OK?<br />- Yeah.
2752591 2753707 Slab's gotta weigh two tons.
2754071 2755398 We'll never move it.
2798084 2800259 What did you say this room was called?
2801934 2803712 Sacrificial chamber.
2819968 2821173 Can you hear me?
2821208 2822738 - Rousseau.<br />- Tommy, come in.
2823007 2824724 - Is there anything you didn't tell me?
2824851 2825652 Nothing.
2825687 2827000 - Your guess is as good as mine.
2827276 2829321 Whatever it is, we're not prepared.
2829593 2832897 We're gonna round up the rest of the team<br />and get to the surface. Let's move!
2837090 2838276 - What are you doing?
2838531 2839739 - My job.
2840474 2841566 Yours is over.
2841668 2844951 My job is over when everyone<br />is back on the boat safely.
2845078 2847049 And that gun doesn't change anything.
2862322 2864533 This bearing should take us<br />back to the entrance.
2864886 2866841 We'll regroup at the whaling station.
2867157 2868993 What about Thomas? Rousseau?
2870025 2871516 - We'll find them on the way up.
2871580 2872580 - Max?
2872584 2874711 Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.
2875225 2878677 The heat bloom your satellite detected<br />makes more sense now.
2878712 2879708 What do you mean?
2880900 2883221 A building this sophisticated<br />requires an energy source.
2884573 2886185 I think that's what your satellite detected.
2886435 2888471 A power plant for this pyramid firing up.
2889359 2890369 - Preparing.
2890582 2892579 - Preparing? For what?
2892991 2894121 Gentlemen?
2982702 2983896 Keep close.
2996443 2999061 - Recognise what's on their shoulders?<br />- Yeah.
3003328 3005072 - We worshipped these things?
3005380 3007313 - According to this, we did.
3007722 3010358 And the artefacts you removed from<br />the sarcophagus
3011106 3012750 seem to be their weapons.
3016966 3017817 Let's keep moving.
3017960 3019814 Only another 200 yards to the entrance.
3041924 3042710 Take cover.
3042849 3043729 Move!
3044089 3045082 Where's Stone?
3048861 3050133 Stone!
3070628 3072339 The pyramid's shifting again.
3080765 3081873 The doors are closing.<br />Get out!
3085525 3086436 Come on.
3086808 3088230 OK. Let's go.
3088250 3089050 Let's go.
3089113 3090084 Let's go.
3091405 3092859 Hey! Verheiden!
3098036 3099678 Somebody!
3100116 3101352 Run! Let's go!
3127348 3129109 I hit that son of a bitch dead on.
3129396 3131405 It didn't stop,<br />It didn't slow.
3131406 3133234 - Hey, Verheiden.<br />- It didn't even flinch!
3133269 3134575 - Verheiden.<br />- What?
3135756 3138691 I'm not a soldier but I<br />think you should calm down, really.
3138692 3140859 We're not dead yet, okay?
3141774 3144283 Well, thanks,<br />professor.
3145945 3150223 Actually it's 'doctor'...<br />and you're welcome.
3150224 3151847 What?
3168829 3170435 Hey! Can you hear me?
3174792 3176884 It's Connors! Where are you?
3212738 3215235 We're never getting out of this place.
3217101 3218167 Have you got any children?
3220152 3221179 - Got a son.
3221220 3222027 - Yeah, I've got two.
3222659 3225456 That means that we do not have<br />the luxury of quitting.
3226164 3227496 We're gonna make it outta here.
3229770 3232886 We're surviving this<br />if I have to carry you the whole way.
3240872 3242460 There's no way out back there.
3247169 3248684 No damage.
3253002 3255046 One of our men is dead.
3264830 3266956 I need to know what this man died for.
3269050 3271324 He died trying<br />to make history.
3274737 3278010 Whose... yours?
3289748 3290840 - What's that?
3291172 3292338 - Just a theory.
3293259 3295204 The Aztec calendar was metric.
3295620 3297277 Based on multiples of ten.
3299068 3302190 I'm guessing the pyramid<br />reconfigures every ten minutes.
3325611 3327028 Let's stick together.
3332402 3333561 Weyland.
3339152 3342021 It would seem that
3342386 3344399 we are rats in a maze.
3348069 3349178 Sorry.
3387457 3389311 Connors? Connors!
3404742 3406985 Verheiden? Verheiden?
3407325 3408382 - Oh, God.<br />- Dr Miller!
3409448 3410825 Get me outta here!
3410956 3412909 It's OK. I'm gonna find a way<br />to get down to you. OK?
3418190 3419167 Verheiden!
3419320 3420745 No!
3441030 3442384 You want a piece of me?
3442525 3444900 You ugly son of a bitch!
3457420 3458183 Oh, God.
3483843 3484751 Weyland.
3490681 3493133 Leave it.<br />They can only slow us down.
3493168 3495873 Too much has been lost<br />to leave here with nothing.
3499508 3500722 Give it to me.
3519152 3519900 Max.
3525432 3526376 Hold on.
3526837 3527656 Look out!
3625730 3627267 Come on. We have to get Weyland.
3636165 3637011 Weyland, come on.
3796940 3797899 What were those things?
3797934 3799702 - You tell me,<br />you're the pyramid expert.
3799842 3800762 I've got to stop. I've got to stop.
3805578 3806447 Take it easy.
3806700 3807539 Weyland.
3807574 3808830 Weyland, look at me.
3808865 3809777 Look at me.
3810204 3812309 You have to slow your breathing down.
3812901 3815171 Slow, steady breaths.
3820930 3821792 - Weyland, come on.
3821827 3823133 - I can hardly stand.
3823168 3825372 I'm not gonna let you die down here.
3825668 3826710 You didn't.
3828396 3829302 - There's another one.
3829719 3831208 We have to go.<br />Now!
3831763 3833058 - Weyland.<br />- Come with us.
3833185 3835474 - Get her outta here.<br />- Weyland.
3835603 3837186 - Now!<br />- Come on.
3838200 3839027 Run!
3868356 3870191 Don't turn your back on me.
3885326 3887043 - Wait.<br />- This way.
3887480 3888692 - Weyland.
3902028 3903385 You can't hold them.
3904561 3905721 We have to go.
3906098 3909358 We keep it together,<br />we make it to the surface.
3909842 3913196 Let's go.<br />Let's go.
3918259 3920303 We keep it together,<br />we make it to the surface.
3920338 3922497 We keep it together,<br />we make it to the surface.
3922667 3923716 we make it to the surface.
3923859 3924991 We make it to the surface.
3927872 3928975 Wait.
3937964 3939288 This way.
3945358 3947933 Go! Go!
4027896 4029138 Look over here.
4057908 4059557 - He's marking himself.
4059776 4060773 What?
4061261 4065064 Ancient warriors would mark themselves<br />with the blood of their kill.
4066087 4067948 It's a rite of passage.
4072647 4074665 This is starting to make sense.
4083174 4086632 I think this is<br />a manhood ritual.
4088034 4092994 They've been sent here to prove<br />that they are worthy to become adults.
4095586 4097025 You're saying<br />they're what...
4098935 4100476 teenagers?
4104522 4107590 That's why they didn't carry<br />those guns with them to begin with.
4107591 4108967 They have to earn them.
4122469 4125086 The hieroglyphs are<br />a little difficult to make out.
4126134 4128141 But the story is all here.
4129872 4131487 Thousands of years ago,
4132705 4135526 these hunters found a backwater planet.
4142469 4144544 They taught humans how to build
4145825 4147932 and were worshipped as gods.
4152628 4155913 Every hundred years the gods would return.
4159166 4160705 And when they did,
4161484 4163866 they would expect a sacrifice.
4164297 4165974 Humans were used to breed
4166009 4167455 the ultimate prey.
4176613 4179854 The hunters would battle<br />with these great serpents
4179889 4183441 to prove themselves worthy<br />to carry the mark.
4200752 4202350 But if the hunters lost,
4203261 4205687 they made sure nothing survived.
4210681 4213444 An entire civilisation wiped out overnight.
4217350 4221424 So...<br />the humanoids, the hunters -
4222826 4225041 they brought those creatures here to hunt?
4225076 4226888 And they use us like cattle.
4228078 4230424 We're hosts for them to breed in.
4231233 4234003 The heat bloom was the sign<br />to lure us down here.
4234752 4236468 This whole thing was a trap.
4238403 4239437 Without us,
4239472 4241291 there could be no hunt.
4271744 4273430 Verheiden!
4314448 4316125 Oh, shit.
4320887 4322178 When that door opens,
4322422 4323679 we're dead.
4324367 4325903 - Not if we set things right.
4326309 4327209 - What do you mean?
4327361 4328466 This pyramid
4329220 4330403 is like a prison.
4331640 4333056 We took the guards' guns,
4333091 4335182 and now the prisoners are running free.
4335568 4338576 To restore order, the guards need their guns.
4340668 4341839 When that door opens,
4343597 4345279 we're gonna give that thing his gun back.
4345682 4346634 Are you crazy?
4346916 4349231 During a big-game hunt,<br />the animals being hunted
4349381 4350456 don't arm the hunters.
4350491 4351843 They're not hunting us.
4352352 4354055 We're in the middle of a war.
4354229 4356864 - It's time to pick a side.<br />- We are on our side.
4359050 4362651 We have to consider the possibility<br />that we might not make it out of here.
4366026 4367493 But we have to make sure
4367528 4370463 those serpents don't reach the surface.
4371177 4372162 Because if they do,
4374080 4376582 everything everywhere could die.
4380606 4382238 The enemy of my enemy...
4383815 4385015 is my friend.
4408794 4410731 Let's go find our friend.
