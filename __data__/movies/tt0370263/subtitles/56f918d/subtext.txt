190155 192522 Hey. Hey, hey.
192587 195008 Come here. Take a look at this.
196235 198145 What?
199564 202498 - What is it?<br />- It's a data stream from PS12.
202572 206434 - Where is she?<br />- Right above sector 14.
206508 208515 There isn't anything in sector 14.
208587 210561 There is now.
238923 239626 Hello?
239627 242436 Miss Woods.<br />Pleasure to your acquaintance.
242507 244896 - Who is this?<br />- My name's Maxwell Stafford.
245004 247338 I represent Weyland lndustries.
248236 251748 - Let me guess. He's suing us again?<br />- You misunderstand.
251819 254467 Mr. Weyland has offered to fund<br />the foundation that you are
254468 257635 associated with for a full<br />year, if you'll meet with him.
257707 259048 When?
259115 260576 Tomorrow.
260682 262878 Tomorrow's gonna be a problem.
262879 265953 Take me a week to get<br />back to the world.
266027 269376 Yes, I told Mr. Weyland that.
269451 271873 He said he didn't have a week.
288395 290817 We must be right on top of it.
310827 313194 What is it, Sebastian?
326922 330119 Thomas the burial chamber is here.<br />I know it. We are gonna find it.
330186 333863 I know it too, but without a crew<br />and a permit we're out of business.
333931 335996 Hold the team together<br />for two days.
335997 338787 I'll go to Mexico City and<br />I'll talk to the bank.
338859 340898 I'll get us more money.
340970 344864 I might be able to help you<br />accomplish that, Professor.
344938 347304 Do I know you?
347818 350981 In exchange for a little of your time.
374762 378057 Oh, I'm sorry.<br />I should've switched the flash off.
378121 380707 There's your magazine. Excuse me.
380778 382633 That's OK.
382698 385993 I'm documenting the trip for my boys.<br />This is them.
386058 388425 Jacob and Scotty.
388842 391078 Would you mind taking a picture?<br />Thank you.
391146 395335 Just wanna show them<br />that their dad wasn't always so boring.
395401 397573 - Smile.<br />- OK.
399466 401734 - There you go.<br />- Thank you.
401801 404649 I'm Graeme Miller. I'm a chemical engineer.
404713 407845 Alexa Woods,<br />environmental technician and guide.
407913 410728 - Do you work for Weyland?<br />- Oh, no.
410793 414884 No, I split my time between working<br />for a small environmental group
414953 418182 and taking scientists<br />on expeditions on the ice.
418250 421598 Lex. You and your friend buckle up.<br />We're gonna hit some turbulence.
421673 424041 Thanks, Jack.
424105 426527 - Is he a friend of yours?<br />- Of my dad's.
426602 428674 He trained most of the pilots down here.
428745 432357 - We just passed the PSR.<br />- Oh, damn. I wish I'd got a picture.
432842 435362 - Of what?<br />- The PSR.
435434 438946 I wish he'd called it out<br />before we passed it.
439017 442334 The PSR is the point of safe return.
442410 446370 It means we've used up half our fuel,<br />so we can't turn back.
447049 452352 Right, but if something went wrong,<br />we could land, presumably.
452425 454661 - We could ditch.<br />- Yeah. Ditch.
454729 459551 But the temperature of the water<br />would kill us in three minutes.
472714 475463 Welcome aboard, everybody. Please.
475946 479687 Some of you may be wondering<br />why this team has been assembled.
479753 482306 Your host will give you<br />the answer now.
482377 484450 Mr. Weyland.
497673 502408 Seven days ago, one of my satellites<br />over Antarctica hunting for mineral deposits
502473 507558 discovered a sudden heat bloom<br />beneath the earth, which outlined this.
507625 510178 The red lines indicate solid walls.
510632 512283 Through thermal mapping,
512284 516481 we've generated a rough three-<br />dimensional image of the structure.
516553 522565 It's massive, containing hundreds of rooms,<br />all built around a central core.
523624 525893 My experts tell me it's a pyramid.
527177 530822 What they can't agree on<br />is who built it and when.
530890 535013 One expert tells me this has features<br />reminiscent of the Aztecs.
535081 537667 Another tells me it's probably Cambodian.
537737 541992 What they all agree on is that<br />the smooth side is definitively Egyptian.
542057 545352 - I think your experts are right.<br />- Which one?
545417 548832 - All of them.<br />- Meaning what, exactly?
549769 553893 This pyramid contains<br />the features of all three cultures.
554953 557986 This might be the first pyramid ever built.
558057 562498 - But built by whom?<br />- By the first civilization.
563912 565735 Thank you.
565802 568835 But how could anyone possibly<br />build a pyramid out here?
568905 571719 Ancient maps show<br />Antarctica free of ice.
571784 574763 It's likely the continent<br />was once habitable.
574764 576771 Well I can't tell you who built it.
576841 580256 But if I could take a sample from it,<br />I can tell you how old it is.
580328 583645 Well Dr. Miller, I'm offering<br />to put you right next to this thing.
583721 587430 - What caused the heat bloom?<br />- I don't know.
587496 590813 - Where exactly on the ice is this?<br />- Bouvetoya lsland.
590889 594631 But it's not on the ice.<br />It's 2,000 ft below it.
597512 600099 - Mr. Quinn?<br />- Mr. Stafford.
600168 602796 You're looking at the best<br />drilling team in the world.
602797 604708 We'll chew to that<br />depth in seven days.
604777 607711 Add three weeks on top of that<br />to train everyone here.
607785 610720 We don't have that kind<br />of time, Ms. Woods.
610793 613662 I'm not the only one<br />with a satellite over Antarctica.
613736 615941 Others will be here soon.
616008 617421 Maybe I wasn't clear.
617422 620449 No one in this room is<br />ready for this trip.
620521 622790 That's why I asked you here.
622856 625856 Bouvetoya is one of the world's<br />most isolated places in the world.
625857 627558 The nearest land is<br />1,000 miles away.
627624 629945 There's no help if<br />we run into trouble.
629946 632033 You're right.<br />It's a no-man's-land.
632104 634887 But the train has left the station.
634953 638946 And I think I speak<br />for everyone aboard this ship.
639017 640926 This is worth the risk.
649897 652449 Find another guide.
668360 669696 I've spoken with Mr. Weyland.
669697 671906 Money's been wired to<br />your foundation account.
671976 675140 Chopper's refueling to fly you home.
676360 678749 Who'd you get?
679817 681955 Gerald Murdoch.
685416 685883 Come in.
685884 687750 Gerald Murdoch has two<br />seasons of ice time.
687816 689639 He's not ready.
689704 690639 Don't worry about it.
690640 692552 What about Paul Woodman<br />or Andrew Keenan?
692617 693360 - We called him.<br />- And?
693361 695748 They gave the same<br />bullshit answer you did.
695816 697245 "Bullshit"?
698569 701368 What I told you in<br />there wasn't bullshit.
701369 704766 If you rush this, people will<br />get hurt. Maybe die.
704841 706650 I don't understand your<br />objection Miss Woods.
706651 708418 We're not asking you<br />to take us up Everest.
708488 712285 We need you to take us from the ship<br />to the pyramid, and back. That's it.
712360 715459 - What about inside the pyramid?<br />- You don't have to worry about that.
715528 716684 Once we're on the site,
716685 719751 we have the best technology and<br />experts that money can buy.
719816 721725 - Is this new?<br />- It's the latest.
721800 726534 Mr. Weyland, when I lead my team<br />I don't ever leave my team.
726600 728705 I admire your passion.
729609 732707 I wish you were going with us.
732776 734848 You're making a mistake.
741512 744829 It's in the upper atmosphere.
745736 748419 Streams of protons<br />and electrons from the sun
748488 751078 being deflected by the<br />earth's magnetic field,
751079 752896 causing a solar radiation storm.
752967 757605 Shackleton called Antarctica<br />"the last great journey left to man".
758056 761471 It's the one place left in the world<br />that no one owns.
761544 763584 It's completely free.
765512 768993 Me, I'm sort of partial<br />to the penguins.
771911 775359 I wish you'd reconsider<br />coming with us, Lex.
775432 779523 Come on, don't make me pull out<br />pictures of my kids again.
779591 781599 Your kids aren't that cute.
781671 785698 What if we got pictures<br />of other people's kids?
785768 788321 Want my advice?
788904 791043 Stay on the boat.
791112 794407 OK. Let me ask you something.
794952 797854 Do we stand a better chance<br />of surviving with you
797928 801276 or with the number-two choice?
802152 804934 Miss Woods, your<br />helicopter's refueled.
804999 807618 They're waiting for you.
870056 872609 Everybody, listen up!
872679 874851 Gather round.
875560 879422 Told you she'd stay.<br />She can't resist my animal magnetism.
879527 881666 Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.
881736 883296 Gentlemen?
884904 888548 It is my job to keep you alive<br />on this expedition,
888616 890820 and I need your help to do that.
890888 893479 Since I don't have time<br />to properly train you,
893480 895078 I'm laying down three rules.
895143 899584 One. No one goes anywhere alone, ever.
899656 901761 Two.
901831 906371 Everyone must maintain<br />constant communication.
906440 909756 Three. Unexpected things are gonna happen.
909832 912963 When they do,<br />no one tries to be a hero.
913831 916100 Understood?
917480 919006 Understood?
919080 921568 - Yes, ma'am.<br />- Good.
926088 930016 Seven seasons on the ice and I've<br />never seen a gun save someone's life.
930088 933666 - I don't plan on using it.<br />- Then why bring it?
933736 935841 Same principle as a condom.
935911 940286 I'd rather have one and not need it<br />than need it and not have one.
941062 943484 I'm glad that you decided to stay.
945511 948642 Move the trucks out of the ice.
948711 951460 Move that. OK, let's move.
964775 967109 - What's with the bottle cap?<br />- What?
967175 969893 What's with the bottle cap?
971431 974594 This is a valuable<br />archaeological find.
981991 984541 When I was a kid<br />growing up in ltaly,
984542 987293 you know what they<br />call a moon that big?
987783 989921 La luna del cacciatore.
993798 995621 Brava.
995686 998685 - What's that?<br />- Hunter's moon.
999078 1001412 Hunter's moon.
1018055 1020421 Hold it, guys.
1021990 1026147 - Keep those engines running!<br />- Set it down.
1026214 1029531 Move up a little further. Connors.
1047110 1049085 It's an abandoned whaling station.
1049158 1052158 According to your satellite<br />imagery Mr. Weyland
1052159 1054908 the pyramid is located<br />directly beneath it.
1067846 1070977 All right, bring it up. Come on.
1071046 1073664 Spread out.
1073734 1075709 We'll use this place as a base camp.
1075782 1078847 Mr. Quinn, begin drilling operations<br />as soon as you can.
1078918 1081984 I'm on it. OK, guys, let's move out.
1123973 1126559 - What are these?<br />- Whale bones.
1129094 1134363 This station was abandoned in 1904.<br />Everyone just disappeared overnight.
1134437 1137284 It was a big mystery back then.
1185317 1188132 One for National Geographic.
1230021 1233698 - Lex.<br />- No one goes anywhere alone.
1233765 1237693 There's something there.<br />Listen. Listen.
1244068 1246240 Careful. They bite.
1257829 1260098 Over here. Over here.
1260165 1261856 What is it?
1262981 1265436 Can you believe that?
1273732 1277443 It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.
1277510 1281700 - How far does it go down?<br />- All the way to the pyramid.
1281765 1285562 There it is. Clear as day.<br />And the same time yesterday...
1286916 1289502 - Nothing.<br />- How was it done?
1289573 1294308 - Thermal equipment of some kind.<br />- Like yours?
1294374 1296991 More advanced. Incredibly powerful.
1299396 1301917 I've never seen anything like it.
1301988 1304623 There's no team and no<br />machine in the world
1304624 1307139 that could cut to this<br />depth in 24 hours.
1307205 1309350 Well, the only way<br />we're gonna know for
1309351 1311548 sure is to get down<br />there and find out.
1334501 1336836 Look at that. Change it. Now!
1337796 1341855 OK, guys, what's taking so long?<br />There's a storm coming.
1351077 1354338 There's no room for sick men<br />on this expedition.
1354405 1356751 My doctors tell me the<br />worst is behind me.
1356752 1359042 You're not a very good<br />liar, Mr. Weyland.
1359109 1362884 Stay on the ship. We'll update you<br />at the top of every hour.
1362950 1364002 When you get sick,
1364003 1367684 you think about your life and<br />how you're gonna be remembered.
1367749 1371458 You know what will happen when I go?<br />Ten per cent fall in share prices.
1371525 1373892 Maybe 12. That's it.
1374725 1377573 I've heard this speech before.
1377637 1381859 My dad broke his leg 700ft from the<br />summit of Mount Rainier.
1382469 1386046 He was like you.<br />He wouldn't go back or let us stop.
1386117 1390012 We reached the top,<br />and he opened a bottle of champagne.
1391941 1395803 I had my first drink with<br />my dad at 14,400 ft.
1397188 1398070 On the way down,
1398071 1401597 he developed a blood clot in his<br />leg that traveled to his lung.
1401669 1406011 He suffered for four hours<br />before dying 20 minutes from the base.
1407365 1411489 You think that's the last thing<br />your dad remembers? The pain?
1411972 1417602 Or drinking champagne<br />with his daughter 14,000ft in the air?
1419396 1420956 I need this.
1429477 1431714 Come on, move.
1475684 1477058 Shit.
1481604 1483360 Mr. Weyland!
1483428 1485599 Man down!
1485668 1488418 Get him! Somebody get him!
1510981 1512060 Move it!
1512133 1513823 Now!
1600420 1605635 I don't understand it.<br />No equipment. No sign of another team.
1607748 1610814 Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.
1612516 1616345 Move it. Connors, get those lights up.
1616420 1618591 We have power.
1651970 1654458 Congratulations, Mr. Weyland.
1654531 1658622 Looks like you'll be<br />leaving your mark after all.
1661091 1663938 Thank you. Thank you.
1664002 1666336 Thank you all for this.
1667778 1669949 Let's make history.
1792675 1794780 Thomas.
1795714 1797721 What is it?
1798849 1802363 - I recognize the Egyptian...<br />- The second symbol is Aztec.
1802434 1805849 Pre-conquest era.<br />The third is Cambodian.
1805922 1809599 Then you were right. The pyramid<br />contains all three cultures.
1809666 1816157 - That's what it looks like.<br />- "You may choose to enter."
1817058 1819840 "Those who choose may enter."
1819906 1822044 Who taught you to translate?
1822114 1825212 Funny. Kinda looked like you.
1826306 1829568 Well, it's not "choose".
1829634 1831423 It's "chosen".
1831874 1834460 "Only the chosen ones may enter."
1853698 1857113 Quinn, is that you out there?
1898945 1900571 Mikkel.
1999554 2001920 What is all this?
2001985 2005564 This is the sacrificial chamber.
2009089 2011609 Like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.
2011681 2016503 Whoever built this pyramid<br />believed in ritual sacrifice.
2016577 2020887 This is where the chosen ones<br />were offered to the gods.
2029633 2032950 Those that were chosen would lie here.
2033025 2035513 They weren't bound or tied in any way.
2036033 2038586 They went to die willingly.
2038657 2040631 Men and women.
2042210 2044827 It was considered an honor.
2045889 2048475 Lucky them.
2057986 2062906 "They gave their lives<br />so the hunt could begin."
2074146 2076054 What happened here?
2076129 2079577 It's common in ritual sacrifice<br />to take the heart of the victim.
2079649 2081885 That's nice.
2081952 2084822 But that's not where your heart is.
2085761 2089754 Besides, it looks like the bones<br />were bent straight out.
2091264 2094364 Something broke out of this body.
2144929 2149883 - What have you found, Max?<br />- It's a shaft to another level.
2150433 2153466 Looks like there's another room down there.
2175169 2179805 - Let's move to that lower room.<br />- We're moving on, everyone.
2179872 2182207 Ms. Woods.
2183393 2185775 You, stay here.<br />Rousseau, you stay with him.
2185776 2186939 Keep a team with you.
2187009 2188764 Catalogue everything.
2190465 2191926 Professor.
2210496 2215068 This should be directly below<br />the sacrificial chamber.
2222049 2224121 Sebastian.
2230177 2232926 It's a sarcophagus.
2235264 2237501 This is the Long Count.
2238849 2241183 This is the Aztec calendar.
2241249 2245046 And this, it's some kind of combination lock.
2246721 2248694 "Days."
2249536 2251358 "Months."
2251424 2253432 "Years."
2254112 2256447 The dials are set for...
2261089 2263455 1904.
2263520 2265942 Someone opened this 100 years ago?
2266657 2269472 - What's today's date?<br />- October 10.
2269537 2272057 10/10/2004.
2274464 2278773 - Are you sure this is gonna work?<br />- I don't know.
2291712 2293915 Back up!
2313759 2316376 Oh, my God. Take a look at this.
2341342 2344604 - Any idea what these are?<br />- No.
2344702 2346874 - You?<br />- No.
2346943 2349229 It's a good thing we<br />brought the experts.
2349230 2350970 Well, yeah. It is a good thing.
2351039 2354520 'Cause this is like finding<br />Moses' DVD collection.
2359871 2361627 Weyland?
2364031 2366714 A little too much excitement.
2368351 2370522 Okay, we've been out long<br />enough for today.
2370591 2372950 We'll set up base camp<br />at the whaling station
2372951 2374847 and get back at it<br />tomorrow morning.
2374911 2377093 Well, you can go back<br />to the base camp,
2377094 2379002 Ms. Woods, but we're<br />staying here.
2379071 2382616 No. You wanted to leave<br />without proper prep. We did.
2382686 2385457 You wanted to be the first here.<br />We are.
2385458 2387957 You've claimed the find.<br />It's yours.
2388031 2392056 Now, we move as a team,<br />and we're done for the day.
2392126 2394330 You heard her.
2395007 2397153 What do you wanna do<br />with these, Mr Weyland?
2397154 2397689 Take them.
2397759 2399832 We'll run further tests on the surface.
2399902 2402652 No. No! Don't touch them.
2417503 2420405 - Watch out!<br />- The doors!
2420479 2422584 The door!
2441054 2442909 - You okay?<br />- Yeah.
2443454 2447611 Slab's gotta weigh two tons.<br />We'll never move it.
2487359 2489912 What did you say this room was called?
2490814 2493181 Sacrificial chamber.
2506590 2509012 - Rousseau.<br />- Tommy, come in.
2509087 2510810 - Come in, Rousseau.<br />- Tommy, Come in.
2510878 2512872 Is there anything<br />you didn't tell me?
2512873 2514970 Nothing.<br />Your guess is as good as mine.
2515039 2517340 Well whatever it is,<br />we're not prepared.
2517406 2519680 We're gonna round up<br />the rest of the team
2519681 2521629 and get to the surface.<br />Let's move!
2524479 2528734 - What are you doing?<br />- My job. Yours is over.
2528798 2532027 My job is over when everyone<br />is back on the boat safely.
2532094 2535323 And that gun doesn't change anything.
2548606 2550980 This bearing should take<br />us back to the entrance
2550981 2553014 and we'll regroup at<br />the whaling station.
2553086 2555901 What about Thomas? Rousseau?
2555966 2558454 - We'll find them on the way up.<br />- Max?
2558526 2560861 Stone, Verheiden. Cover our backs.
2560927 2564439 The heat bloom your satellite detected<br />makes more sense now Mr. Weyland.
2564510 2566266 What do you mean?
2566333 2569595 Well a building this sophisticated<br />requires a major energy source.
2569663 2572276 I think that's what your<br />satellite detected.
2572277 2574714 A power plant for this<br />pyramid firing up.
2574782 2577684 - Preparing.<br />- Preparing? For what?
2577758 2579764 Gentlemen?
2649694 2651669 Keep close.
2662590 2667030 - Recognize what's on their shoulders?<br />- Yeah.
2669534 2673624 - We worshipped these things?<br />- According to this, we did.
2673694 2676382 And the artifacts<br />you removed from
2676383 2679607 the sarcophagus seem<br />to be their weapons.
2682557 2687445 Let's keep moving. Only another<br />200 yards to the entrance.
2706205 2708410 Take cover.
2708477 2709938 Where's Stone?
2713150 2714840 Stone!
2733950 2736437 The pyramid's shifting again.
2743678 2746361 The doors are closing. Get out.
2748477 2749557 Come on.
2749629 2750840 OK. Let's go.
2750909 2752851 Let's go. Let's go.
2754205 2755798 Hey! Verheiden!
2755869 2757080 Verheiden!
2757693 2759897 Verheiden!
2760445 2762137 Somebody!
2762206 2764441 Run! Let's go!
2764509 2766003 No!
2766077 2768051 Quickly!
2768125 2771322 No! No!
2800572 2803060 Hey! Can you hear me?
2807005 2809656 It's Connors! Where are you?
2831709 2834840 We're never getting out of this place.
2835613 2837686 Have you got any children?
2838524 2840664 - A son.<br />- Yeah, I've got two.
2840734 2844029 That means that we do not have<br />the luxury of quitting.
2844093 2846744 We're gonna make it outta here.
2847677 2852630 We're surviving this if I have<br />to carry you the whole way.
2858333 2860700 There's no way out back there.
2861980 2865079 - What's that?<br />- Just a theory.
2865148 2869403 The Aztec calendar was metric.<br />Based on multiples of ten.
2870621 2874931 I'm guessing the pyramid<br />reconfigures every ten minutes.
2896157 2898939 Let's stick together.
2902717 2904539 Weyland.
2909085 2914420 It would seem that<br />we are rats in a maze.
2917725 2919285 Sorry.
2955515 2957905 Connors? Connors!
2971963 2974418 Verheiden? Verheiden?
2974524 2977688 - Oh, God.<br />- Dr. Miller! Get me outta here!
2977756 2981433 It's okay. I'm gonna find a way<br />to get down to you. Okay?
2984828 2986038 Verheiden!
2986107 2987863 No!
3006683 3010961 You want a piece of me?<br />You ugly son of a bitch!
3022331 3023760 Oh, God.
3047644 3049072 Weyland.
3049147 3052344 - You OK?<br />- Yeah, I'm fine.
3054459 3056915 Leave it. They can only slow us down.
3056987 3060849 Too much has been lost<br />to leave here with nothing.
3062907 3064882 Give it to me.
3081787 3084722 Max.
3087900 3089045 Hold on.
3089115 3091155 Look out!
3183066 3185717 Come on. We have to get Weyland.
3193083 3195090 Weyland, come on.
3347386 3349939 - What's our team?<br />- You're the expert.
3350010 3352857 I've got to stop. I've got to stop.
3355609 3358359 Take it easy. Weyland.
3358426 3359986 Look at me.
3360057 3362578 You have to slow your breathing down.
3362650 3364985 Slow, steady breaths.
3370362 3372631 - Weyland, come on.<br />- I can hardly stand.
3372698 3374935 I'm not gonna let you die down here.
3375002 3377424 You didn't.
3377498 3380588 There's another one.<br />We have to go. Now!
3380589 3381360 Weyland.
3381434 3384216 - Come with us.<br />- Sebastian, get her outta here.
3384282 3386737 - Now!<br />- Come on.
3386810 3389298 Run!
3415610 3418544 Don't turn your back on me.
3445402 3446645 Wait.
3454809 3456271 This way.
3461882 3464784 Go! Go!
3541082 3543057 Look over here.
3569784 3572882 - He's marking himself.<br />- What?
3572952 3577425 Ancient warriors would mark themselves<br />with the blood of their kill.
3577496 3579668 It's a rite of passage.
3584056 3586707 This is starting to make sense.
3595064 3599025 The hieroglyphs are<br />a little difficult to make out.
3599095 3601779 But the story is all here.
3605368 3610736 Thousands of years ago, these<br />hunters found a backwater planet.
3617465 3622679 They taught humans how to build<br />and were worshipped as gods.
3627032 3630741 Every hundred years<br />the gods would return.
3633304 3637679 And when they did,<br />they would expect a sacrifice.
3638360 3641808 Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.
3650008 3653357 The hunters would battle<br />with these great serpents
3653432 3657109 to prove themselves worthy<br />to carry the mark.
3673144 3675566 But if the hunters lost,
3675640 3678454 they made sure nothing survived.
3682776 3686605 An entire civilization<br />wiped out overnight.
3689144 3690485 So...
3691063 3693266 the humanoids, the hunters -
3693267 3696727 they brought those<br />creatures here to hunt?
3696792 3698799 And they use us like cattle.
3699639 3702487 We're hosts for them to breed in.
3702552 3705847 The heat bloom was the sign<br />to lure us down here.
3705945 3708661 This whole thing was a trap.
3709528 3712146 Without us, there could be no hunt.
3740055 3741582 Shit!
3741656 3743630 Verheiden!
3782744 3783954 Oh, shit.
3788663 3791860 When that door opens, we're dead.
3791928 3794830 - Not if we set things right.<br />- What do you mean?
3794904 3797903 This pyramid is like a prison.
3798935 3802547 We took the guards' guns, and now<br />the prisoners are running free.
3802615 3805964 To restore order,<br />the guards need their guns.
3807575 3812397 When that door opens, we're gonna<br />give that thing his gun back.
3812471 3814535 Are you crazy?<br />During a big-game hunt,
3814536 3817075 the animals being hunted<br />don't arm the hunters.
3817144 3820526 They're not hunting us.<br />We're in the middle of a war.
3820598 3824112 - It's time to pick a side.<br />- We are on our side.
3825047 3830710 We have to consider the possibility<br />that we might not make it out of here.
3831736 3836111 But we have to make sure those<br />serpents don't reach the surface.
3836759 3839029 Because if they do,
3839640 3842028 everything everywhere could die.
3845815 3847789 The enemy of my enemy...
3848887 3850894 is my friend.
3872919 3875374 Let's go find our friend.
3884791 3887474 How do you say "scared<br />shitless" in ltalian?
3887542 3890012 Non vedo l'ora di<br />uscire con te da questa
3890013 3892365 piramide perch� mi<br />sto cagando addosso.
3892440 3894741 More or less.
3915767 3917294 Move!
3939831 3941391 Lex.
3943478 3944885 Lex.
3944950 3946445 Hold on.
3946871 3948594 Come on, Lex.
3954583 3955793 Oh, no.
4066487 4068821 Wait. Wait. Please, wait.
4072663 4075729 The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
4078134 4080435 The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
4196309 4200565 I'm coming with you.<br />You hear me, you ugly creature?
4245333 4247471 What are you doing?
4371829 4373836 Miller!
4382036 4383859 Miller!
4432020 4433296 Sebastian.
4434164 4436914 - Help me, Lex.<br />- I'm gonna get you out of there.
4436980 4440558 - It's too late. It's inside me.<br />- I'm gonna get you outta here.
4440628 4442799 - You can't...<br />- No!
4442869 4445716 No. No. No! No!
4445780 4447787 I have to help him.
4450931 4452655 Lex!
4452723 4455145 They mustn't reach the surface.
4455507 4458322 They mustn't reach the surface.
4458388 4460809 I know.
4468436 4470444 Do it!
4473908 4475915 I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
4552563 4554832 It's a bomb.
4554899 4557071 Well, I hope it kills every<br />fucking one of 'em.
4600852 4603721 You are one ugly motherfucker...
4918097 4919755 Got it!
