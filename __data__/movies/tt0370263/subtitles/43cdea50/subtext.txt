214055 216595 Lunch.
223773 226021 Hey. Hey. Hey
226117 228414 Come here. Take a look at this.
230597 233415 - What is it?<br />- It's a data stream from PS12.
233867 237161 - Where is she?<br />- Right above Sector 14.
238288 240223 There isn't anything in Sector 14.
240415 242617 There is now.
270570 272340 Hello.
272572 275352 <i>Miss Woods, pleasure to<br />make your acquaintance.</i>
275825 278198 - Who is this?<br /><i>- My name? Maxwell Stafford</i>
278536 280738 <i>I represent Wayland Industries.</i>
281539 283537 Let me guess. He's suing us again?
283750 286405 <i>You misunderstand. Mr Weyland-<br />he's offered to fund...</i>
286836 290868 <i>the foundation with which you are associated<br />for a full year if you'll meet with him.</i>
291758 293568 - When?<br /><i>- Tomorrow</i>
293718 296258 Tomorrows gonna be a problem.
298180 300381 It'll take me a week<br />to get back to the world.
300517 303203 <i>Yes, I told Mr. Weyland that.</i>
303645 306339 He said he didn't have a week.
323414 325995 We must be right on top of it.
346270 348442 What is it, Sebastian?
362495 364806 Early 1950s, I'd say.
365823 368296 Hey, Juan, we are almost there.
368376 370249 Huh, according to you...
370420 373231 The Teotihuac�n's final gift to<br />their dying king was a Pepsi.
373715 376214 - Come on. Give me one more month, please.<br />- No.
376593 378810 I'm bringing in another team.
379095 380843 What?
380972 383877 Without a crew and a new permit,<br />we're out of business.
384392 386797 Okay. Hold the team together for two days.
387145 389800 I'll go to Mexico City,<br />and I'll talk to the bank.
390230 392229 - I'll get us more money.<br />- Right.
392442 395740 I might be able to help you<br />accomplish that, Professor.
397113 399080 Do I know you?
399282 403102 In exchange for a little of your time.
427185 430059 I'm sorry. I should have, um,<br />switched the flash off.
430563 432561 There's your magazine.
432774 435147 Excuse me, - That's okay.
435485 438203 I'm-I'm documenting the trip for my boys.
438655 441622 This is them. Jacob and Scotty
442158 444320 Would you mind just taking a picture?<br />Thank you.
444400 445519 Sure.
446079 448919 Just want to show them that<br />their dad wasn't always so boring.
449374 450829 - Smile.<br />- Okay
453169 455292 - There you go.<br />- Thank you.
455546 458546 I'm Graeme Miller. I'm a chemical engineer.
459092 461591 Alexa Woods. Environmental technician and guide.
461970 463842 Do you work for Weyland?
464013 466794 Oh, no. No, I, um-
467267 470148 I split my time between working for<br />a small environmental group...
470228 472820 and taking scientists on expeditions on the ice.
473230 476312 Lex. You and your friend buckle up.<br />We're gonna hit some turbulence.
476776 478528 Thanks, jack.
479862 481826 - Is he a friend of yours?<br />- Of my dad's.
481906 484436 My father trained most of the pilots down here.
484826 487544 - Just passed the P.S.R.<br />- Damn. I wish I got a picture.
487996 490494 - Of what?<br />- Um, the-the P.S.R.
490873 493454 I wish he'd called it out before we passed it.
494877 497845 The P.S.R. is the "point of safe return."
498380 501679 It means we've used up half our fuel,<br />so we can't turn back.
503594 505834 Right. But if something went wrong, we could...
505930 508460 land, presumably.
508850 510879 - We could ditch.<br />- Yeah. Ditch.
511102 514206 But the temperature of the water<br />would kill us in three minutes
534292 537885 - Weyland's check cleared.<br />- Good, You know what?
538629 541590 We're gonna listen to whatever<br />he has to say. We nod, we smile...
542050 544830 And we politely decline whatever offer he makes.
545303 547583 Take the money, and we head back to Mexico.
547889 549797 - Right.<br />- Right.
560485 563140 - Havin' fun?<br />- Yeah. It's quite an adventure.
563570 567092 Listen, my kids are not going to believe<br />this. Would you mind taking a picture?
567408 569704 Um, you have to hold it like<br />that till it flashes twice.
569784 570988 You're kidding.
571620 575152 - Get off, or you'll wear your ass for a hat.<br />- Okay.
575875 578869 - All right. Okay. Sure.<br />- Nice team spirit.
580755 583565 Keep the beakers away from the gear.
586552 588394 What does he mean, "beaker"?
588554 590897 That's what they call scientists out here.
591224 594786 - You know, Beaker, like in The Muppet Show.<br />- Everybody please.
595520 597879 Your attention.
602485 606530 Mr. Weyland.
617125 618997 Seven days ago...
619168 622248 one of my satellites over Antarctica<br />hunting for mineral deposits...
622547 625139 discovered a sudden heat<br />bloom beneath the earth...
625550 627641 which outlined this.
627885 630039 The red lines indicate solid walls.
630304 632052 Through thermal mapping...
632180 635735 we've generated a rough<br />three-dimensional image of the structure
637103 639508 It's massive, containing hundreds of rooms...
639856 642888 All built around a central core.
644277 646462 My experts tell me it's a pyramid.
646737 650613 What they can't agree on<br />is who built it and when.
651450 655388 One expert tells me this has features<br />reminiscent of the Aztecs.
656247 658527 Another tell me it's probably Cambodian.
658833 661707 What they all agree on is that the smooth side...
662210 663424 Is definitively Egyptian.
663504 666034 - I think your experts are right.<br />- Which one?
666424 669640 - All of them.<br />- Meaning what exactly?
671512 675783 This pyramid contains the<br />features of all three cultures.
677268 679798 This might be the first pyramid ever built.
680188 683374 - But built by whom?<br />- By the first civilization.
686360 688514 Thank you.
688779 691622 But how could anyone possibly<br />build a pyramid out here?
692116 694177 Ancient maps show Antarctica free of ice.
694410 697659 It's likely the continent was once habitable,
698289 700412 Well, I can't tell you who built it, but...
700666 703297 If I can take a sample from it,<br />I can tell you how old it is.
703377 706417 Well, Dr. Miller, I'm offering to<br />put you right next to this thing.
706964 709431 What caused the heat bloom?
709800 712299 - I don't know.<br />- Where exactly on the ice is this?
712678 715865 Bouvet�ya Island. But it's not on the ice.
716474 718533 It's 2,000 feet below it.
721354 723758 - Mr. Quinn.<br />- Mr. Stafford
724106 726627 You're looking at the best<br />drilling team in the world.
726859 728951 We'll chew to that depth in seven days.
729195 732100 And add three weeks on top of<br />that to train everyone here.
732615 734863 We don't have that kind of time, Miss Woods.
735159 737680 I'm not the only one with<br />a satellite over Antarctica.
738037 740504 Others will be here-soon.
740873 742715 Maybe I wasn't clear.
742875 745061 No one in this room is ready for this trip.
745336 747178 Well, that's why I asked you here.
747338 750619 Bouvet�ya is one of the most<br />isolated places in the world,
751259 754860 The nearest land is a thousand miles away<br />There's no help if we run into trouble.
755304 757239 You're right. It's a no-man's-land.
757430 759562 But the train has left the station.
760685 763340 And I think I speak for<br />everyone aboard this ship.
763770 766690 This is worth the risk.
775783 777914 Find another guide.
787670 792883 Hydraulic Team 3 report<br />for safety check on Deck B4.
795136 798776 I've spoken with Mr. Weyland. The money's<br />been wired to your foundation's account.
799223 801845 Chopper's refueling to fly you home.
803560 806779 - Who'd you get?<br />- O.C.R. team in 1300 hours.
807398 809600 Gerald Murdoch.
812486 813286 Come in.
813366 816161 Gerry Murdoch has two seasons<br />of ice time. He's not ready.
817742 820748 - Don't worry about it.<br />- What about Paul Woodman or Andrew Keeler?
820828 822576 - We called 'em.<br />- And?
822705 825440 - They gave the same bullshit answer you did.<br />- Bullshit?
826626 829562 Mr. Weyland, what I told you wasn't bullshit.
830087 832241 If you rush this, people will get hurt.
832506 832961 Maybe die.
833040 834929 I don't understand your objections, Miss Woods.
835009 836931 We're not asking you to take us up Everest.
837010 840812 We need you take us from the ship to the<br />pyramid and then back to the ship. That's it.
841057 843086 And what about inside the pyramid?
843309 845606 You don't have to worry about that.<br />Once we're on the site...
845686 848526 we have the best equipment, technology<br />and experts that money can buy.
848606 850854 - Is this new?<br />- It's the latest.
851150 852992 Mr. Weyland, when I lead my team...
853152 855713 I don't ever leave my team
856113 858315 I admire your passion.
859240 862052 I wish you were going with us.
862536 864707 You're making a mistake.
871420 874073 It's in the upper atmosphere.
875883 878475 Streams of protons and electrons from the sun...
878886 882407 Being deflected by the Earth's magnetic<br />field, causing a solar radiation storm.
882640 887234 Shackleton called Antarctica<br />the last great journey left to man.
888312 891687 It's the one place left in<br />the world that no one owns.
892358 894673 It's completely free.
896570 900206 Me-I'm sort of partial to the penguins.
903452 906326 I wish you'd reconsider coming with us, Lex.
906830 910049 Come on. Don't make me pull out<br />pictures of my kids again.
910668 913135 Your kids aren't that cute.
913504 915972 What if we got pictures of other people's kids?
917675 920017 Want my advice?
920344 922403 Stay on the boat.
923556 926242 Okay. Let me ask you something.
926684 929213 Do we stand a better chance<br />of surviving with you...
929603 932481 or with the number two choice?
933858 935606 Miss Woods.
935735 939371 Your helicopter is refueled.<br />They're waiting for you.
1005513 1008136 Everybody listen up!
1008557 1010399 Gather round.
1010559 1012683 - Told you she'd stay.<br />- Gentlemen.
1012937 1014841 She can't resist my animal magnetism.
1015022 1017364 Laugh it up, Miller. Laugh it up.
1017690 1019525 Gentlemen.
1020945 1024038 It is my job to keep you<br />alive on this expedition.
1024615 1026457 And I need your help to do that.
1026617 1030917 Since I don't have time to properly train<br />you, I'm laying down three simple rules.
1031497 1035614 One: No one goes anywhere alone-ever.
1036627 1038688 Two:
1038920 1042734 Everyone must maintain constant communication.
1043550 1046644 Three: Unexpected things are gonna happen.
1047220 1050501 When they do, no one tries to be a hero.
1051140 1053681 Understood?
1054728 1057320 - Understood?<br />- Yes, ma'am.
1057730 1059452 Good.
1064154 1067466 Seven seasons on the ice, and<br />I've never seen a gun save someones life.
1068117 1070964 - I don't plan on using it.<br />- Then why bring it?
1071954 1074108 The same principle as a condom.
1074373 1076294 I'd rather have one and not need it...
1076458 1078550 than need it and not have one.
1078794 1082123 I'm glad that you decided to stay
1084383 1086225 Move the trucks out on the ice.
1086385 1088258 Move that.
1088429 1090560 Hey, let's go.
1103736 1106359 - What's with the bottle cap?<br />- What?
1106780 1108726 What's with the bottle cap?
1111535 1114639 This is a-a valuable archeological find.
1122504 1124502 When I was a kid growing up in Italy...
1124715 1127370 you know what they call a moon that big?
1127800 1130237 La Luna del cacciatore.
1130596 1133908 "La Luna del cacciatore."
1134558 1136869 - Brava.<br />- What's that?
1137186 1139403 Hunter's moon.
1139688 1143058 "Hunter's moon."
1159040 1161326 Hold it, guys
1163087 1165397 Keep those engines runnin'!
1165714 1168025 Set it down.
1168342 1170309 Hey. Move up a little further.
1170510 1172713 Connors.
1190072 1192320 It's an abandoned whaling station.
1192616 1194872 According to your satellite<br />imagery, Mr. Weyland...
1194952 1197492 the pyramid is located directly beneath it.
1212052 1214206 All right. Bring it up. Come on. Come on.
1214470 1216560 Spread out.
1217890 1220045 We'll use this place as a base camp.
1220310 1222910 Mr. Quinn, begin drilling<br />operations as soon as you can.
1223313 1226754 I'm on it. Okay, guys. Let's move out.
1270569 1273150 - What are these?<br />- Whale bones.
1275949 1278260 This station was abandoned in 1904.
1278577 1280825 Everyone just disappeared overnight.
1281120 1283406 It was a big mystery back then.
1334258 1337249 One for National Geographic.
1380470 1382312 Lex.
1382472 1384752 No one goes anywhere alone.
1385058 1386900 There's something there. Listen.
1387060 1389938 Listen.
1395819 1397950 Careful. They bite.
1409208 1411737 Hey. Over here! Over here!
1412127 1414258 What is it?
1415630 1417916 Can you believe that?
1426016 1429457 It's drilled at a perfect 30-degree angle.
1430770 1434145 - How far does it go down?<br />- All the way to the pyramid.
1434816 1437033 There it is. Clear as day
1437319 1439818 And the same time yesterday.
1440197 1442570 - Nothing.<br />- How was it done?
1442908 1444781 Thermal equipment of some kind.
1444952 1447544 Like yours?
1447955 1450833 More advanced. Incredibly powerful.
1452500 1455406 I've never seen anything like it.
1455920 1458802 I'm telling you. There's no team<br />and no machine in the world...
1459174 1461391 that could cut to this depth in 24 hours.
1461677 1463807 Well, the only way we're gonna know for sure...
1463887 1466089 is to get down there and find out.
1489663 1492244 Look at that. Change it now!
1493166 1495821 Okay, guys. What's taking so long?
1496253 1497328 There is a storm coming.
1497408 1500225 Come on! Pack 'em and<br />stack 'em! Get 'em inside!
1507097 1510190 There's no room for sick<br />men on this expedition.
1510767 1512859 My doctors tell me the worst is behind me.
1513103 1515476 You're not a very good liar, Mr. Weyland.
1515814 1518575 Stay on the ship. We'll update you<br />at the top of every hour.
1518775 1520867 You know, when you get sick...
1521110 1523867 you think about your life<br />and how you're gonna be remembered.
1523947 1526352 You know what I realize will happen when I go?
1526700 1529199 Ten percent fall in share prices. Maybe twelve.
1529578 1533623 - That's it.<br />- I've heard this speech before.
1535125 1538530 My dad broke his leg 700 feet<br />from the summit of Mt. Rainier.
1539212 1542493 He was like you. He wouldn't<br />go back or let us stop.
1543133 1545256 We reached the top...
1545510 1547825 and he opened a bottle of champagne.
1549680 1553743 I had my first drink<br />with my dad at 14,400 feet.
1554644 1558301 On the way down he developed a blood clot<br />in his leg that traveled to his lung.
1559066 1564310 He suffered for four hours before<br />dying twenty minutes from the base.
1565989 1569395 You think that's the last thing<br />your dad remembers? The pain?
1570077 1574614 Or drinking champagne with his<br />daughter 74,000 feet in the air?
1578043 1580214 I need this.
1589012 1591327 Come on. Move!
1635600 1638632 Shit.
1642607 1644761 Mr. Weyland!
1645026 1647150 Man down!
1647404 1649914 - Mr. Weyland!<br />- Get him! Somebody get him!
1673805 1675936 Move it! Now!
1767399 1770335 I don't understand it. No equipment.
1770860 1772991 No sign of another team.
1774864 1776995 Well, that tunnel didn't dig itself.
1779619 1782837 Move it. Connors, get those lights up.
1783456 1786109 We have power.
1820827 1823388 Congratulations, Mr. Weyland.
1823788 1826707 Looks like you'll be<br />leaving your mark after all.
1830754 1833127 Thank you. Thank you.
1833465 1835780 Thank you all for this.
1837594 1839837 Let's make history.
1967766 1970139 Thomas.
1970477 1972792 What is it?
1973813 1975655 I recognize the Egyptian.
1975815 1978407 The second symbol is Aztec. Preconquest era.
1978818 1981442 The third is Cambodian.
1981863 1984800 Then you were right. The pyramid<br />contains all three cultures.
1985325 1987542 That's what it looks like.
1987827 1990764 "You may... choose...
1991289 1993537 to enter."
1993833 1995831 "Those who choose may enter."
1996044 1998292 Who taught you to translate?
1998588 2001548 Funny. Kind of looked like you.
2003092 2005497 Well, it's not "choose."
2005845 2007780 It's "chosen."
2007972 2011116 "Only the chosen ones may enter."
2031663 2033834 Quinn, is that you out there?
2078877 2081274 Mikkel.
2184524 2186710 What is all this?
2186985 2189679 This is the sacrificial chamber.
2194659 2197001 Just like the Aztecs and the Egyptians.
2197328 2199981 Whoever built this pyramid<br />believed in ritual sacrifice.
2202500 2205460 This is where the chosen ones<br />were offered to the gods.
2215054 2218616 Those that were chosen would lie here.
2219350 2221598 They weren't bound or tied in any way.
2221894 2224330 They went to die willingly.
2224689 2227342 Men and women.
2228818 2231246 It was considered an honor.
2232739 2235504 Lucky them.
2240120 2241994 Oh, God.
2242165 2244069 It's incredible.
2244250 2248558 The entire skull and spinal<br />column's removed in one piece.
2249589 2251461 Look at this.
2251632 2254413 Look at that. The cleanness of the cut.
2254886 2258589 Straight through the bone.<br />There's no abrasions, nothing.
2270985 2274539 It's probably just the air<br />moving through the tunnels.
2275865 2278036 Maybe.
2322160 2324691 Whatever this is, it's been dead a while.
2325080 2327454 The bones have completely calcified.
2327792 2331152 No idea how long it's been here, but<br />the temperature has kept it preserved.
2331712 2334117 Looks like some kind of scorpion.
2334465 2337370 No. Climate's too hostile for a scorpion.
2337885 2339524 Ever seen anything like it?
2349230 2351572 "They gave their lives...
2351899 2354552 so the hunt could begin."
2366038 2367943 What happened here?
2368124 2371217 It's common in ritual sacrifice<br />to take the heart of the victim.
2371794 2373948 That's nice.
2374213 2376866 But that's not where your heart is.
2378342 2381446 Besides, it looks like the<br />bones were bent straight out.
2383930 2385908 Something broke out of this body.
2439862 2441923 What have you found, Max?
2442156 2444717 It's a shaft to another level
2445117 2447964 Looks like there's another room down there.
2473187 2475060 Let's move to that lower room, Max.
2475230 2479011 We're moving on, everyone. Miss Woods.
2481570 2485164 You. Stay here. Rousseau, you stay<br />with him. Keep a team with you.
2485908 2488219 Catalog everything.
2488536 2490779 Professor.
2509390 2512463 This should be directly<br />below the sacrificial chamber.
2522153 2524355 Sebastian.
2530160 2532363 It's a sarcophagus.
2535708 2538394 This is the Long Count.
2538836 2541491 This is the Aztec calendar.
2541922 2545066 And this-It's some kind of combination lock.
2547219 2549872 Days.
2550806 2554586 Months. Years.
2555728 2558493 The dials are set for...
2562276 2564407 1904.
2565320 2567507 Someone opened this a hundred years ago?
2567782 2569748 What's today's date?
2569950 2573955 - October 10.<br />- 10/10/2004.
2576207 2579167 - You sure this is gonna work?<br />- I don't know.
2595059 2597077 Back up!
2617998 2620426 Oh, my God. Take a look at this.
2645734 2647576 Any idea what these are?
2647736 2649578 No.
2649738 2651517 You?
2651657 2653977 - No.<br />- It's a good thing we brought the experts.
2654160 2655845 Well, yeah, It is a good thing.
2655953 2659394 Cause this is like finding Moses' DVD collection
2663710 2667902 Weyland.
2670300 2672544 A little too much excitement.
2674472 2676970 Okay. We've uh, we've been<br />out long enough far today
2677349 2679980 "We're gonna setup base camp<br />tonight at the whaling station."
2680060 2681816 and get back at it first thing tomorrow
2681896 2685297 Well, you can go back to the base camp,<br />Miss Woods, but, we're staying here.
2685649 2687710 No.
2687943 2689990 You wanted to leave without proper prep. We did.
2690070 2692475 You wanted to be the first ones here. We are.
2692823 2695322 You've claimed the find. It's yours.
2695700 2698700 Now, we move as a team,<br />and we're done for the day.
2699246 2701713 You heard her.
2702082 2703751 What do you want to do with these, Mr. Weyland?
2703830 2704786 Take them.
2705127 2707156 We'll run further tests on the surface.
2707379 2709190 No. No!
2709340 2711993 Don't touch them.
2724939 2726655 Watch out.
2726774 2728646 The doors!
2728817 2731214 The door.
2733113 2735090 What's going on?
2737326 2740020 Look out.
2748462 2750867 - See if you can stop it.<br />- You okay?
2751215 2753176 - Yeah.<br />- There must be another way out.
2753300 2756219 The slab's gotta weigh two tons.<br />We'll never move it.
2798012 2800552 What did you say this room was called?
2802308 2804848 Sacrificial chamber.
2817156 2819279 Thomas. Rousseau.
2819533 2821375 - Tom, come in.<br />- Come in, Rousseau.
2821535 2823377 - Rousseau!<br />- Tommy, come in.
2823537 2825501 - Is there anything you didn't tell me?<br />- Nothing.
2825580 2827516 Your guess is as good as mine.
2827708 2829672 Well, whatever it is, we're not prepared for it.
2829752 2833644 We're gonna round up the rest of the<br />team and get to the surface. Let's move!
2835883 2838412 What are you doing?
2838802 2840675 My job.
2840846 2841708 Yours is over.
2841788 2844769 My job is over when everyone<br />is back on the boat safely.
2845517 2848621 And that gun doesn't change anything.
2861909 2864814 This bearing should take<br />us back to the entrance...
2865329 2867330 and we'll regroup at the whaling station.
2867498 2870059 What about Thomas? Rousseau?
2870459 2872801 - We'll find them on the way up.<br />- Max.
2873128 2875189 Stone, Verheiden, cover our backs.
2875422 2879143 The heat bloom that your satellite detected<br />makes a lot more sense now, Mr. Weyland.
2879259 2882196 - What do you mean?<br />- Well, a building this sophisticated...
2882720 2884268 Would require a major energy source.
2884348 2886061 I think that's what your satellite detected
2886140 2889141 A power plant for this pyramid firing up.
2889687 2891466 - Preparing.<br />- Preparing?
2891605 2894033 - For what?<br />- Gentlemen
2982696 2984867 Keep close.
2996210 2999805 - Recognize what's on their shoulders?<br />- Yeah.
3002758 3004849 We worshipped these things?
3005093 3006841 According to this, we did.
3006970 3010626 And the artifacts you removed<br />from the sarcophagus...
3011390 3014044 seem to be their weapons.
3017230 3020222 Let's keep moving. Only another<br />two hundred yards to the entrance.
3042339 3043927 - Take cover.<br />- Move! Move!
3044007 3045841 Where's Stone?
3048554 3050839 Stone!
3071200 3073332 The pyramid's shifting again!
3081210 3083679 The doors are dosing! Get out!
3085716 3088026 - Come on!<br />- Let's go!
3088343 3090248 Let's go! Let's go!
3090429 3091539 Hey!
3091722 3093375 Hey, Verheiden!
3093473 3097004 Verheiden!
3097728 3099819 Somebody!
3100063 3101717 Run! Let's go!
3101815 3103224 No!
3104109 3106044 Quickly!
3106236 3109306 No! No!
3126465 3129057 I hit that son of a bitch dead-on.
3129468 3131310 It didn't stop, it didn't slow.
3131470 3133342 - Hey, Verheiden.<br />- It didn't flinch!
3133513 3135637 - Verheiden.<br />- What?
3135890 3138984 I am not a soldier, but I think<br />you should calm down now
3139560 3141685 We're not dead yet, okay?
3141939 3145083 Well, thanks, Professor.
3146234 3150015 Actually, it's "Doctor"<br />and you're welcome. Okay?
3150822 3152953 What?
3168423 3171045 Hey! Can you hear me?
3175305 3177733 It's Connors! Where are you?
3212634 3215594 We're never getting out of this place.
3216470 3219503 Have you got any children?
3220517 3222421 - Got a son.<br />- Yeah I've got two.
3222602 3225122 That means that we do not have<br />the luxury of quitting.
3225397 3228425 We're gonna make it out of here.
3230027 3233212 We're surviving this if I<br />have to carry you the whole way.
3241163 3243365 There's no way out back there.
3247502 3250008 No damage.
3253300 3256110 One of our men is dead.
3265020 3267827 I need to know what this man died for.
3269149 3271351 He died trying to make history.
3274738 3277616 Whose? Yours?
3289920 3292825 - What's that?<br />- Just a theory.
3293340 3295182 The Aztec calendar was metric-
3295342 3296263 based on multiples of ten.
3296343 3298685 Based on multiples of ten.
3299012 3302491 I'm guessing that the pyramid<br />reconfigures every ten minutes.
3325664 3327835 Let's stick together.
3332712 3335519 Weyland.
3338844 3340560 It would seem...
3340679 3344532 that we are rats in a maze.
3347810 3349745 Sorry.
3384930 3386402 Shit.
3387893 3390136 Connors? Connors!
3403408 3405907 Verheiden?
3406286 3408159 Verheiden. Oh, God.
3408330 3411204 - Come on! Get me out of here!<br />- It's okay
3411708 3413630 I'm gonna find a way to get down to you, okay?
3413710 3415645 Get me out of here!
3415837 3417898 Verheiden!
3418130 3421163 - Verheiden!<br />- No!
3440904 3442871 Want a piece of me?
3443073 3445613 You ugly son of a bitch!
3456044 3458922 Oh, God.
3483613 3485986 Weyland, you okay?
3486324 3488946 Yeah. I'm fine.
3490328 3492639 Leave it. It can only slow us down.
3492956 3496479 Too much has been lost<br />to leave here with nothing.
3499713 3501884 Give it to me.
3519232 3521066 - Max!<br />- Max!
3525613 3528123 - Hold on.<br />- Look out!
3625839 3628492 Come on. We have to get Weyland.
3635890 3638512 Weyland come on. Move!
3642105 3644983 Come on. Come on, you guys.
3795008 3797663 - Come on.<br />- What were those things?
3798094 3800123 You tell me. You're the pyramid expert.
3800346 3802814 I've got to stop. I've got to stop.
3805602 3807631 Take it easy. Weyland.
3807854 3810102 Weyland. Look at me. Look at me.
3810398 3812740 You have to slow your breathing down.
3813067 3815689 Slow, steady breaths.
3821034 3822956 - Weyland, come on.<br />- I can hardly stand.
3823036 3825565 Weyland, I'm not gonna let you die down here.
3825955 3828547 You didn't.
3828958 3831394 There's another one! We have to go. Now!
3831753 3833970 - Weyland.<br />- Come with us.
3834255 3836553 - Sebastian, get her out of here. Now!<br />- Weyland.
3836633 3838179 Come on.
3838259 3840424 Run!
3868289 3870266 Don't turn your back on me.
3886474 3888645 - Lex, wait.<br />- Weyland!
3901322 3904227 You can't help him.
3904742 3906584 We have to go.
3906744 3909774 We keep it together, we make it to the surface.
3910330 3913667 Let's go. Let's go.
3918464 3920618 We keep it together, we make it to the-
3920883 3922975 We keep it together, we make it to the sur-
3923219 3926251 We make it to the sur-, make it to the surface.
3928599 3931815 Wait.
3938609 3940811 This way.
3945742 3948320 Go. Go!
4027615 4030125 Look over here.
4057395 4061019 - He's marking himself.<br />- What?
4061774 4065305 Ancient warriors would mark themselves<br />with the blood of their kill.
4066028 4068456 It's a rite of passage.
4072493 4075146 This is starting to make sense.
4082712 4086931 I think this is a manhood ritual.
4087884 4091039 The humanoid ones, they've been sent here...
4091637 4094741 to prove that they're worthy to become adults.
4096058 4101383 You're saying they're, what, teenagers?
4104984 4107905 That's why they didn't carry<br />those guns with them to begin with.
4108362 4110677 They have to earn them.
4122335 4124990 The hieroglyphs are a<br />little difficult to make out...
4125420 4128299 but the story's all here.
4130343 4135856 Thousands of years ago,<br />these hunters found a backwater planet.
4142897 4148253 They taught humans how to build<br />and were worshipped as gods
4153074 4156334 Every hundred years, the gods would return.
4159580 4164018 And when they did, they would expect a sacrifice.
4165044 4169355 Humans were used to breed the ultimate prey.
4176930 4180024 The hunters would battle<br />with these great serpents...
4180600 4184606 to prove themselves worthy to carry the mark.
4200037 4202817 But if the hunters lost...
4203290 4206394 they made sure nothing survived.
4210965 4214376 An entire civilization wiped out overnight.
4217847 4221878 So, the humanoids, the hunters...
4222768 4225111 they brought those creatures here to hunt?
4225438 4227404 And they use us like cattle.
4227606 4230793 We're hosts for them to breed in.
4231402 4236574 The heat bloom was designed to lure us<br />down here. This whole thing was a trap.
4238659 4242367 Without us, there could be no hunt.
4271025 4274323 Shoot it! Verheiden!
4315027 4316594 Oh, shit.
4321492 4323991 When that door opens, we're dead.
4324370 4327244 - Not if we set things right.<br />- What do you mean?
4327748 4331279 This pyramid, it's like a prison.
4332002 4335189 We took the guards' guns,<br />and now the prisoners are running free.
4335798 4339352 To restore order, the guards need their guns.
4341303 4345209 When that door opens, we're gonna<br />give that thing his gun back.
4346058 4348431 Are you crazy? During a big game hunt...
4348769 4350858 the animals being hunted don't arm the hunters.
4350938 4353968 They're not hunting us.<br />We're in the middle of a war.
4354525 4358079 - It's time to pick a side.<br />- We are on our side.
4359655 4363772 We have to consider the possibility<br />we might not make it out of here.
4366412 4370068 But we have to make sure those<br />serpents don't reach the surface.
4370833 4373425 Because if they do...
4373836 4377022 everything everywhere could die.
4381093 4386040 The enemy of my enemy... is my friend.
4408746 4411778 Let's go find our friend.
4421717 4424677 How do you say "scared shitless" in Italian?
4428682 4430997 More or less.
4452915 4455037 Move!
4478857 4480819 Lex!
4481819 4483942 Lex.
4484196 4485701 Hold on.
4485780 4488425 Come on, Lex.
4492746 4494865 Oh, no.
4610447 4613479 Wait. Wait. Please, wait.
4617370 4621529 The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
4744580 4749231 Hey. I'm coming with you,<br />you hear me, you ugly creature?
4803724 4806121 What are you doing?
4950203 4952103 Miller.
5013517 5016766 - Sebastian.<br />- Help me, Lex.
5017395 5019756 - I'm gonna get you out of there.<br />- It's too late.
5019940 5022301 - It's inside me.<br />- I'm gonna get you out of here.
5022442 5025629 - You can't-<br />- No! No. N-
5026238 5029946 No! No. I have to help him.
5033829 5037234 Lex! They mustn't reach the surface.
5037916 5041777 - They mustn't reach the surface.<br />- I know.
5050512 5052571 Do it!
5057269 5060188 I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
5138642 5141234 It's a bomb.
5141645 5144042 Well, I hope it kills every fuckin' one of 'em.
5189567 5193203 You are one ugly motherf-
5519814 5522211 Got it!
