27359 30780 The first murder happened<br />before I was born.
34075 36659 The killer called himself<br />Clovehitch
36661 38663 after his favorite type<br />of knot.
41165 43167 Our town lived in fear.
45210 48381 And then, ten years ago,<br />he stopped.
51843 54260 Every year, our community<br />had a memorial
54262 56847 for friends and family<br />of the victims.
60185 63103 At the time, I didn't think<br />about it much.
72655 75033 Someone has to be leading<br />the detail.
76200 78619 Why? Anyone?
80579 83330 To keep everyone in step,<br />that's number one.
83332 85457 Number two, here, stand up,<br />come here.
85459 88335 In my day, what we did was
88337 90296 flag up, shoulders back.
90298 91588 Put your shoulders back.
91590 93257 There you go.
93259 95510 Now, if it's windy<br />on that day
95512 98011 what's his other arm gonna do?
98013 99555 - Steady the flag.<br />- Right.
99557 101850 Then on the day..<br />You two, come up here.
103394 105811 Side to side.
105813 109149 Your job is you're gonna..<br />You're gonna push.
110402 113528 Here. Right?<br />Shoulder to shoulder.
113530 116321 You're gonna keep that formation<br />solid for the flag bearer
116323 119368 who's got the weight<br />of the flag plus wind.
125917 128378 Very, very nice.<br />Okay, great job. Have a seat.
130379 134299 How about giving them<br />a round of applause?
145979 149691 Hey, bud. I, uh, I've been<br />meaning to talk to you.
155320 158364 Work's been slow and, uh,<br />Uncle Rudy's insurance
158366 159906 is going up, so I can't..
159908 161578 I can't send you to<br />leadership camp.
164788 167290 Yeah, but I... I need it to<br />stand out on my application.
167292 170459 That's what the recruiter said.
170461 172377 Yeah, it's just, um,<br />you know, we... we're gonna
172379 174130 we're gonna work<br />on your rank together.

187479 189272 Yeah, I got it, I got it,<br />I got it.
193485 196029 Oh, no!<br />Oh-ho, we got him.
197489 200864 You may be getting taller,<br />but I can still kick your butt.
200866 202949 - Quit.<br />- Say it.
202951 204204 - No!<br />- Say it.

399565 402315 I don't even know<br />where this came from.
402317 404151 Okay, well, it's your truck.
404153 405863 Yeah, but this isn't mine.
407615 410699 Really, no. This... this isn't<br />mine. It's gross.

419209 420669 No, it's getting kinda late.
425716 426967 Yeah.
437978 439687 You see how tall<br />you're getting?
439689 442190 Honey, she's taller than Tyler<br />was at the same age.
442192 444401 It's all the growth hormones<br />I've been adding to the batter.
445653 447445 Tyler, hurry up!
447447 449863 - Sorry, Mom.<br />- Woo-oop!
449865 451367 One more for me.
453202 454453 There we go.
458791 459917 - Amen.<br />- Amen.
460999 461459 Let's eat.
461461 463543 Are you gonna have time<br />to pick up Uncle Rudy?
463545 464628 We gotta take separate cars.
464630 465962 I can't find my keys.
465964 467589 Tyler, have you seen my keys?
467591 469841 - Mnm-mnm.<br />- We gotta go. Eat.
469843 472094 - Stuff your faces.<br />- Mmm.
472096 474012 - Oh!<br />- This is good.
474014 475889 Is that..<br />Is that delicious or what?
475891 477015 If you say so yourself.

533658 534866 Who cares?
534868 536617 Just what is she doing?
536619 537993 Planning a church shooting<br />or something?
537995 540204 She's not planning<br />a church shooting.
540206 543833 She's not Christian.<br />She's sick.
543835 545459 I know her from school.
545461 547880 She always does the same report<br />about the killings every year.
549841 551384 What, do you have a crush on her<br />or something?
552802 554259 That's disgusting.
554261 555469 Don't you know<br />she did it with, like,
555471 556887 five different<br />football players
556889 558557 because her mom left the family<br />to be a stripper?
559808 562100 We should pray for her.
562102 563643 Or maybe call the cops.
563645 566605 Tyler, you can speak with Billy<br />later. We have rounds to do.
566607 568067 - I'll see you later.<br />- See ya.
576493 579743 And remember, Daniel is showing<br />us not only faith
579745 581371 but he's showing us<br />the kind of faith
581373 584748 that can cope with<br />Babylonian captivity.
584750 586876 You see,<br />in order to live in Babylon
586878 588044 Daniel lived his whole life.
588046 589796 He was like a layman,<br />he wasn't like a..
589798 591381 Put that away, please.
591383 593465 ...like Jeremiah.<br />He was a layman.
593467 597302 He lived his whole life in the<br />arena of Babylonian politics.
597304 600013 It was just as hostile a world<br />as you could possibly live in.
600015 602809 How come Dad doesn't<br />have to help with couponing?
602811 604604 'Cause your father<br />has his own hobbies.
606355 608647 What did you think of<br />the sermon today?
611653 612734 ...without reservation
612736 614695 he believed in<br />the power of God.
614697 616321 That's why he made<br />that appointment
616323 617573 with Nebuchadnezzar. He said..
617575 620535 You're addicted to this thing.<br />I don't like it.
620537 622869 I need to see that.
624874 625956 I just need to see<br />who's texting.
625958 627166 He believed in<br />the power of God.
627168 629669 What's so important?
630964 633256 Daniel believed in the power<br />of prayer absolutely.
633258 635049 Nothing.<br />Never mind.

678635 681595 No, I texted like one person<br />who I thought would never tell.
681597 683848 What? I don't even know<br />what that was.
683850 687100 It wasn't mine, okay?<br />It was in my dad's truck.

750917 753126 Oh! Go on.
753128 754379 Go get 'em..
789163 791499 Happy birthday, Susie.
951576 953536 Tyler, give me a hand<br />out here!
957414 960123 Tyler?
961878 963088 Tyler?
1049840 1050922 What are you doing?
1050924 1052424 Oh, I was just
1052426 1054762 online finishing up some<br />school stuff.
1059392 1061353 I am very disappointed.
1062936 1065230 - Um, Mom..<br />- Go to bed.
1066732 1067817 Mom..
1069193 1070819 Go to bed, Tyler.
1073490 1075032 Yes, ma'am.
1116407 1118492 Mom says we have to have<br />a little talk.
1120537 1121954 Have a seat.
1136010 1137177 Our secret.
1138637 1140097 Just the men folk.
1145686 1148272 I've been keeping another secret<br />for you, bud.
1152986 1155613 I know you took my truck<br />the other night.
1158991 1161575 Mom worries about you driving,<br />'cause of Uncle Rudy
1161577 1164120 but I figure you're old enough<br />to sneak out once or twice.
1164122 1165997 But now we have to straighten<br />a few things out
1165999 1169459 that might be confusing you.
1169461 1171335 Like what you're looking at<br />on the computer at...
1171337 1173255 I wasn't looking at anything.
1177594 1179095 Okay.
1182640 1183932 Sex.
1187269 1188562 There, I said it.
1193526 1196528 You know<br />we're made in God's image.
1197780 1200030 That means your body
1200032 1202784 is a holy thing
1202786 1205119 not to be desecrated.
1205121 1206373 You know what that means?
1207457 1211249 But, men like you and me
1211251 1213294 we got thoughts.
1213296 1215337 We got thoughts that<br />start to..
1216715 1218216 Start to pop into our heads.
1218218 1220677 You ever get<br />those thoughts, bud?
1220679 1222263 Thoughts about girls?
1223597 1224930 I get it.
1224932 1228060 I mean, believe it or not,<br />I was 16 once.
1230020 1232022 We're in a bit of a pickle,<br />aren't we?
1233525 1236859 We got God over here<br />on this side
1236861 1241530 and we got a sex-crazed monkey<br />over here on this side.
1241532 1243117 You with me so far, bud?
1244201 1245577 Not really.
1249833 1251250 Here's the thing.
1254503 1257256 It's okay to have thoughts.
1258508 1260882 That's just a fantasy.
1260884 1263928 God will look the other way.<br />He's a busy man.
1263930 1266432 But no pictures.
1267976 1269310 Got it?
1272896 1276690 A fantasy's okay,<br />it's not real. It's just..
1276692 1279526 It's just monkey stuff.
1279528 1282404 You can't control what pops<br />into your head, right?
1282406 1284865 I mean, what if a thought popped into<br />your head right now, a bad thought?
1284867 1287744 Something like,<br />I don't know..
1287746 1291291 You know, grabbing one of these,<br />these tools in here and wham!
1292750 1294251 You'd never do it in<br />real life, right?
1295461 1296794 Never. Hah.
1296796 1300590 It's just,<br />just monkey stuff, right?
1300592 1302469 Yeah, monkey stuff.
1304887 1306470 Oh..
1306472 1307557 There.
1309308 1310225 We did it.
1311603 1314480 Awkward talk with Dad over.
1316648 1317983 Car wash.
1327618 1330161 Can I talk to you<br />about something?
1330163 1331953 I told you, I'm busy.
1331955 1333457 Come on, one minute.
1341508 1345133 The reason I had that thing that<br />Amy saw wasn't what you think.
1345135 1346969 I'm trying not to think<br />about it.
1346971 1349930 I don't like that stuff<br />at all.
1349932 1352642 It's shown me something,<br />something bad.
1352644 1354227 Something that I... I can't<br />get out of my head.
1354229 1355478 I... I know it's<br />probably not true
1355480 1357854 but I think I just need to talk<br />to somebody about it because...
1357856 1359606 I'm gonna stop you right there.
1359608 1360732 I know where you're<br />going with this
1360734 1362276 and I'm not going to<br />discuss it.
1362278 1363902 - What?<br />- It's a sin.
1363904 1365738 And you have a choice.
1365740 1368115 - Billy, come on.<br />- It's a choice.
1368117 1369535 I'm not even gonna.
1433349 1434933 The fuck you following me for?
1436853 1439644 You remember me, right?
1439646 1440606 Tyler the perv.
1441857 1443275 How's the perving?
1445236 1448488 Why are you always reading the<br />newspaper outside of our church?
1448490 1449656 I like bad news.
1452117 1455827 - Okay.<br />- And I can sit wherever I want.
1455829 1457537 I thought you people were<br />supposed to be all friendly
1457539 1458914 and giving and shit?
1458916 1460458 No, of..
1460460 1462045 No, yeah, no.<br />It's totally fine.
1463630 1464589 Great.
1466423 1468924 Hey, um, you know about that<br />Clovehitch stuff, right?
1468926 1471594 'Cause I was thinking maybe<br />I could ask you a few questions
1471596 1473136 'cause I was on some<br />bad website and...
1473138 1475055 Oh, I get it.
1476101 1478101 You heard that rumor
1478103 1480853 about me and the five guys<br />on the football team.
1480855 1483355 - And you thought that if you...<br />- No. No, no, no.
1483357 1486692 It's okay.<br />I'm a slut, you're a perv.
1486694 1489277 We were made for each other.
1489279 1490613 Okay. Cut it out.
1490615 1492782 So serious.<br />No one will know.
1492784 1494619 It's just you and me<br />down here.
1497788 1499788 Whip it out.
1499790 1501333 Let's see what<br />we're dealing with.
1504628 1506421 I'm fucking with you!
1506423 1508631 - No, I know. I really..<br />- Do you?
1508633 1510717 Wait. No, no. I really..<br />I just..
1510719 1513219 I want to know about Clovehitch.<br />That's all, really.
1513221 1515304 Just like the suspects,<br />and... and how you could
1515306 1516514 eliminate certain suspects.
1516516 1518056 Why?
1518058 1520269 Why do you all of a sudden care<br />about this stuff?
1521395 1523103 Are you trying to convert me?
1523105 1525355 - Or is this for a merit badge?<br />- No!
1525357 1527315 No! I..
1527317 1530277 I don't know.<br />It's just stuck in my head.
1530279 1532613 I just went to the memorial<br />the other day
1532615 1535699 and I didn't know any of them,<br />but, still.
1535701 1538244 I thought maybe talking to you<br />about it could help
1538246 1539953 or something.
1539955 1541788 But I don't know.<br />It's probably just stupid.
1541790 1543417 It's not stupid.
1545420 1546796 Come here after 3:00.
1549590 1550674 I'll help you.
1554261 1555512 Bring cookies.
1573405 1575238 Can I help you?
1575240 1577786 Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.<br />I'm looking for Kassi.
1580413 1581748 I brought cookies.
1584500 1586670 Kassi, your little friend<br />is here.
1590464 1592715 I didn't think you'd show.
1592717 1594678 Your grandma's interesting.
1595720 1597386 She's not my grandma.
1597388 1598720 Dumbass.
1598722 1600890 She used to work for the cops.
1600892 1604604 She made a copy of all their<br />files and wrote this book.
1605855 1606897 Sit.
1613904 1617741 And here's everything<br />on his ten official victims.
1622579 1625331 This is victim number eight,<br />Erica Lytle.
1625333 1627374 She was a fifth grade teacher.
1627376 1629546 Clovehitch knew when<br />she would be alone.
1631714 1633881 Sorry, it's pretty graphic.
1633883 1636092 Did they take any<br />Polaroid pictures?
1636094 1637554 No, it's all digital. Why?
1639013 1641555 So this is all the evidence?
1641557 1642931 There's not much.
1642933 1646184 No fingerprints, no blood,<br />no semen, just the rope.
1646186 1649021 Well, rope fibers.<br />And this.
1649023 1651274 Belonged to victim four,<br />Sasha Peterson.
1651276 1653942 Found outside First Baptist.
1653944 1655944 She never went there,<br />I checked.
1655946 1658905 So you were staking out<br />our church to..
1658907 1660533 What, narrow it down?
1660535 1662660 Whoever was going back there?
1662662 1665537 No. Cops already did that.
1665539 1667748 I'm using the FBI playbook.
1667750 1669542 I'm gonna catch him using<br />his weakness.
1669544 1671251 And what's that?
1671253 1672961 He's insane.
1672963 1675506 Every killer has an MO<br />tied to his psychology.
1675508 1677758 It's like a fingerprint.<br />Look.
1677760 1681679 Same entry points, same<br />elaborate ropes on the bodies
1681681 1685350 the clove hitch tied to every<br />victim's house, his signature.
1685352 1688769 He's taunting the cops,<br />using the victims as trophies.
1688771 1691521 It's meticulous and planned.
1691523 1694360 I'm gonna use that fingerprint<br />to connect him to new cases.
1695737 1697819 I don't think he's<br />stopped killing.
1697821 1700073 I think there's more than<br />ten victims.
1700075 1701534 But he has stopped.
1702618 1704828 Serial killers can't stop.
1709166 1711834 This one, or this one?
1711836 1714756 This one. Okay.
1717008 1719760 Ahem! You know, I was thinkin'<br />of volunteering.
1721554 1722555 Mm-hmm.
1723847 1726974 Maybe, uh,<br />doing some tutoring
1726976 1728269 during the afternoons.
1730145 1731978 Where would that be?
1731980 1734148 Oh, over at St. Joseph's.
1734150 1736984 I was talkin' to<br />Billy's friend Martin.
1736986 1738736 He goes there.
1738738 1739903 I think you met him<br />a couple years ago.
1739905 1740904 He's a really nice guy.
1740906 1743326 We donated to their food drive,<br />I think.
1745869 1747786 Well, that's very<br />generous of you, Tyler.
1747788 1751039 But, keep it to afternoons.<br />Evenings is family time.
1751041 1752084 Yes, ma'am.
1758883 1760091 - No!<br />- Gin.
1760093 1761883 - No!<br />- No!
1761885 1763760 - Cheating!<br />- How about that?
1763762 1764845 Again?
1764847 1767099 Don't hate me<br />'cause I'm beautiful.
1830163 1833208 You can pull the wool over your<br />mother's eyes, but not mine.
1836544 1837919 Who was it you were visiting<br />when you're supposed
1837921 1839255 to be tutoring?
1846637 1848847 My boy's got himself<br />a girlfriend.
1851558 1852601 Oh.
1853769 1855230 You know about that?
1858023 1859483 Problem is,<br />you lied to your mother.
1861653 1863738 Oh. W... we..
1864989 1867407 We really just study.<br />That's all.
1867409 1870159 Remember what we talked about<br />before?
1870161 1873787 No, her grandma's there.<br />It's... it's not like that.
1873789 1876748 Yeah, I know.<br />Tell you what.
1876750 1878167 Mom doesn't have to know<br />you're lying
1878169 1879835 but she needs to<br />meet this girl.
1879837 1882838 Invite her over for dinner<br />tomorrow night.
1882840 1884257 I don't know if that's<br />a good idea.
1884259 1887009 I'll have her make her<br />a casserole.
1887011 1888679 Okay. Yes, sir.
1903278 1906069 Hey, would you want to go to
1906071 1907698 dinner tonight at my house?
1909034 1910741 No.
1910743 1912619 My parents want to meet you.
1914497 1916916 - Why?<br />- Um..
1918292 1920668 They think we're going out<br />and, uh..
1920670 1921835 Whoa.
1921837 1923796 - What?<br />- Hm?
1923798 1926132 You know we're not going out,<br />right?
1926134 1929384 Yeah, no.<br />No, of course.
1929386 1932180 No, no, no. Duh, obviously.<br />I just thought..
1932182 1934015 You know, they just..
1934017 1935557 They know we're hanging out,<br />and so..
1935559 1937977 They're not gonna try to convert<br />me to the ways of Jesus, are they?
1937979 1940188 The only thing would be don't<br />talk about Clovehitch
1940190 1943274 'cause they don't know about<br />anything like that, but..
1943276 1945403 I mean,<br />don't talk about anything.
1946528 1949031 Great.<br />I'm definitely coming.
1951076 1954451 Mmm.<br />Great tilapia, hon.
1954453 1956787 So, Kassi,<br />where do you go to church?
1956789 1959123 Oh, I don't go to church.
1959125 1961875 Um, my dad's usually hungover<br />on Sundays
1961877 1963210 and my mom left<br />when I was little.
1963212 1966881 So, um,<br />I'm basically an atheist
1966883 1969134 but I'm considering<br />getting into Wicca.
1971011 1973595 Wicca? Wha..<br />No, I've heard of that.
1973597 1977100 It... it's not black magic,<br />it's um..
1977102 1979102 - A nature-based spiritual...<br />- Oh, Mom.
1979104 1982188 - She's... she's just joking.<br />- Oh, geez.
1982190 1984231 This family doesn't<br />have your sense of humor.
1984233 1987192 Um, she goes to a church<br />across town.
1987194 1991113 Kassi, I hear that, um,<br />you visit an elderly lady?
1991115 1993199 Um, yeah. She is a retired.<br />She used to...
1993201 1995575 That's her grandma.<br />Mavis, yeah.
1995577 1997577 She's a retired secretary<br />at the bank.
1997579 1999957 Tyler,<br />let her answer for herself.
2001334 2003500 Was he this nervous<br />when he asked you out, Kassi?
2003502 2005460 Oh, no.<br />Not at all.
2005462 2008131 He was real smooth.
2008133 2012176 Incredible. So smooth, I didn't<br />realize that he'd asked.
2012178 2014636 Oh, I think I know exactly<br />what you mean.
2014638 2017305 This one over here's<br />the same way.
2017307 2019182 I practically proposed<br />to him myself.
2019184 2020226 Oh, come on.
2020228 2022562 I had that whole ring<br />and speech
2022564 2023854 and I did the one knee.
2023856 2025981 - You exaggerate.<br />- Oh, you did great.
2025983 2029151 - Come on.<br />- You did great.
2030654 2032279 So, Mr. Burnside, um..
2032281 2036409 You teach Tyler and everybody<br />about camping and whittling..
2037619 2038996 Tying knots?
2042125 2045751 Well, Kassi, it's not just about<br />outdoor preparedness anymore.
2045753 2049755 You know, they got,<br />they got badges now for, um
2049757 2052175 computer programming and
2052177 2054302 and photography..<br />All kinds of things.
2054304 2057220 But, yeah,<br />I love whittling and knots.
2057222 2058305 You got me.
2060434 2062601 How many knots do you know?
2062603 2064354 Why don't we talk about<br />something else?
2066065 2068273 This... this is pretty boring.
2068275 2069402 Well, she asked.
2077409 2080577 I'm sorry about<br />the bad joke earlier.
2080579 2083081 I really like spending time<br />with Tyler.
2083083 2085333 I wouldn't want to give<br />the wrong first impression.
2085335 2088378 I just get really nervous<br />and say the wrong thing.
2088380 2091171 - I'm sorry.<br />- Oh..
2091173 2093132 Not at all, sweetheart.<br />Not at all.
2093134 2095342 And you don't<br />need to be nervous.
2095344 2098845 You are the best young lady
2098847 2100597 that he has brought home<br />to meet us.
2102184 2104601 - Also the only one.<br />- Don.
2110735 2112193 Sorry about<br />the whole fish thing.
2112195 2115445 I, I don't even think<br />they know what vegan is.
2115447 2116865 Pull over.
2132423 2133717 So..
2138929 2141056 You think your dad<br />is Clovehitch?
2150900 2153191 You should see your face!
2154487 2156905 It's not your fucking dad.
2157907 2159490 Your dad?
2159492 2161036 He has pictures.
2162369 2165579 - Tyler...<br />- Like bondage porno stuff.
2165581 2167916 That's why everyone thinks<br />I'm a perv.
2169960 2172711 I went in his shed where no one<br />is allowed, and there was more.
2172713 2174923 There was even one that<br />said Nora on it, and.
2176217 2178967 I think that was for<br />Nora Devlin.
2178969 2182429 Right next to it, it says,<br />"Lucky's favorite" on it.
2182431 2184849 - I'm serious.<br />- Lucky?
2184851 2185894 Yeah.
2188896 2191063 There's no way in hell<br />your dad is Clovehitch
2191065 2193775 just because he likes<br />weird porn.
2193777 2195193 He's just kinky.
2197739 2199032 My gosh.
2203119 2204494 Come on, let's go.
2204496 2206371 What, did you think<br />we were gonna make out?
2206373 2207749 - Drive.<br />- Oh.

2218342 2222427 ♪ All day long ♪

2235318 2237318 Come on, dance with me.
2237320 2239570 I... I've seen moves<br />on you tonight
2239572 2242949 that I've never seen<br />in my entire life, mister.
2268268 2270392 What the heck?<br />What are you doing here?
2270394 2272353 Lucky got stuck in my head.<br />I couldn't...
2272355 2274438 - Shh!<br />- I couldn't sleep.
2274440 2276481 So I went through everything,<br />and I went back to Barbara's
2276483 2277566 which she was not happy about.
2277568 2278943 But I found it.
2278945 2281278 Victim number five,<br />she got a note in her mailbox
2281280 2283155 a week before she was killed.
2283157 2285282 Guess what it said?
2301384 2302467 It's gone.
2304429 2305722 Let's go.
2309016 2310225 Let me see.
2312269 2314394 Are you sure it said "Lucky?"
2314396 2317315 - I don't know.<br />- I feel something.
2317317 2318275 Oh, hey.
2321195 2323528 - Shit.<br />- What is that?
2338338 2341716 Does that look like your<br />father's handwriting, Tyler?
2343967 2345135 I don't know.
2346846 2348431 Where is this?
2352518 2354644 My dad will be up soon.
2354646 2356604 Come to Barbara's<br />as soon as you can.
2356606 2358149 Don't let him know<br />you know, okay?
2359608 2360693 You okay?
2362862 2364612 You okay?
2364614 2365990 Yeah.
2585835 2587086 Tyler?
2590547 2592632 Morning, sunshine.
2592634 2595760 Oh, hey, Dad.<br />What time is it?
2595762 2598722 Almost 7:00.<br />Thought we'd get an early start.
2600474 2601516 What?
2601518 2604267 You know what we haven't<br />done in a while?
2604269 2608021 Camping.<br />Just you and me.
2608023 2610652 - Um.. Yeah, today?<br />- Yeah.
2611820 2613653 Thought we'd go have some fun.
2613655 2615405 Father-son bonding.
2615407 2617949 Lock up that rifle badge.
2617951 2619242 Yeah. No, that'd be great.
2619244 2620367 I just feel kind of sick,<br />though.
2620369 2623621 Ah, come on.<br />I'll make you some cereal.
2623623 2624666 Get dressed.
2668251 2670043 Where are we going?
2670045 2671796 We're almost there, bud.
2707916 2709626 Did you tell anyone?
2716965 2718592 Did you tell anyone?
2722179 2723806 - What are you talking about?<br />- Tyler.
2726893 2729938 I know you've been in the shed<br />and in the crawlspace.
2732731 2736608 You had no business<br />invading my privacy.
2736610 2739489 The lack of respect is really<br />disturbing, Tyler.
2740407 2741908 You know better than that.
2743451 2745536 A lock on that door<br />for a reason.
2752751 2756130 What you found in that box<br />wasn't mine.
2760427 2761469 Whose is it?
2769436 2770394 Rudy's.
2773981 2775233 Uncle Rudy?
2777860 2780195 The truth is,<br />I'm ashamed to say..
2784909 2788411 I had an interest in those kinds<br />of photos
2788413 2791166 that you found in the truck<br />a long time ago, years ago.
2793835 2796670 Rudy was the same way,<br />only much, much worse.
2798005 2800049 I knew that from when we were<br />kids, but still.
2801384 2803800 When I found that stuff<br />in his trailer
2803802 2805595 I went to him and I said
2805597 2808641 "Rudy, you gotta<br />turn yourself in."
2812728 2816023 But then... then he tried to..
2817900 2818984 ...you know..
2825157 2827032 I thought it was a car crash.
2827034 2827951 It was.
2829119 2830413 He drove off the road.
2839088 2840923 Well, why do you<br />have that stuff?
2841675 2843009 I was gonna burn it.
2844052 2847180 I swear to God,<br />I was gonna burn it.
2851684 2853186 But the victims' families..
2855188 2856481 ...they have a right to know.
2859317 2861943 Look, then it was never<br />the right time, you know?
2861945 2865320 Susie being born,<br />or some darn thing and..
2865322 2866947 Then I had to think<br />about our family
2866949 2869075 it'd be rough on you kids.
2869077 2870954 And to put your mom<br />through that?
2873248 2874164 For what?
2876583 2878210 Not gonna bring anybody back.
2880922 2882840 But it looks like it's you.
2884092 2884968 Bud.
2888596 2890764 Bud, I don't know, I don't know<br />what else to tell you.
2896603 2899481 Other than<br />I know that you know..
2900900 2902027 ...it isn't me.
2904945 2906280 It's not me.
2910659 2911786 I'm just so..
2914204 2916371 I'm just so damned sorry to
2916373 2918125 to put you through all that.
2921003 2922255 I messed up.
2924632 2926592 I was trying<br />to protect my brother.
2933724 2936516 We have to take it<br />to the police.
2936518 2938186 Or destroy it.
2938188 2939230 But you have to decide.
2995077 2997912 Knot tying<br />exemplifies the skills
2997914 3001289 and the strength<br />of a troop or family.
3001291 3004209 The rope weaves<br />the fibers together
3004211 3008171 and the knot bends them<br />to a common purpose.
3008173 3012010 The square knot<br />used in first aid is a symbol
3012012 3013388 of service to others.
3016724 3018516 - You went camping?<br />- You can't be.. What?
3018518 3021519 I waited and waited and I go by your house<br />and your mom tells me you went camping.
3021521 3022603 Shh! You talked to my mom?
3022605 3023729 I thought he was onto us.
3023731 3026023 No! Keep your voice down. No.
3026025 3027233 He just wanted to take me<br />camping, okay?
3027235 3029568 Good, because I figured it out.<br />It's your house.
3029570 3031153 - What?<br />- Duh, there's a pit under there.
3031155 3032697 - You went under my house?<br />- I couldn't wait.
3032699 3033740 What if he took you camping to<br />get rid of you?
3033742 3035240 Did you find anything<br />under there?
3035242 3037577 - No. He never finished it.<br />- Kassi, that's 'cause it's not him.
3037579 3039996 I asked him about<br />the pictures and everything
3039998 3041164 and he explained it to me.
3041166 3044166 What? How did he<br />explain the blueprints?
3044168 3046336 It's a fantasy.<br />It's not real.
3046338 3047753 What about Lucky?
3047755 3049463 I gotta go back inside.
3049465 3051173 Just believe me that it's not.
3051175 3053175 - Well, then who is it?<br />- I don't know. I'll call you later.
3053177 3055470 I know you don't wanna<br />believe it, but just face it.
3055472 3057054 Look at this.<br />This really happened.
3057056 3058932 No, I don't want<br />to deal with this now!
3063313 3064394 What are you doing?
3064396 3067356 Billy, go back inside.<br />Hey, give me that.
3067358 3068358 You're disgusting,<br />you know that?
3068360 3070485 - Billy, come on.<br />- This is depraved.
3070487 3073195 - Billy, give me it!<br />- Why don't you just come out of the closet already?
3073197 3074655 - Hey.<br />- F you, slut!
3074657 3075617 Hey!
3078536 3080286 - Hey!<br />- Get off of me!
3080288 3082206 Hey! Stop!
3086251 3087336 Hey, buddy.
3089213 3090882 I just got<br />one question for you.
3092175 3094010 Where's Tyler Burnside?
3096179 3097055 What?
3098722 3101014 Where's Tyler Burnside?
3101016 3103184 'Cause the Tyler I know<br />wouldn't resort to violence
3103186 3104437 to settle his disputes.
3105355 3106604 Okay, I get it.
3106606 3108525 Pastor Randy, I'm Tyler.
3109567 3111110 I just lost my temper.
3113153 3115030 You know, that's gonna be<br />some shiner.
3116990 3118451 Everything okay at home?
3126208 3127501 Yeah, it's fine.
3146271 3148396 Oh, I love you so much.
3148398 3149731 Please be careful, okay?
3149733 3151192 Mom, don't worry, I will.
3153277 3155154 You're getting so heavy!
3156364 3158113 I'm gonna get real fat<br />when you're gone
3158115 3159574 so you don't recognize me.
3160577 3161453 Alright.
3163496 3165246 Have a good time.
3165248 3167539 Thanks again, Dad, for coming<br />through with the money.
3167541 3169877 Eh, I figure you learned<br />all you can from me.
3170878 3172420 Have fun.
3172422 3173465 I will.
3174840 3176717 Alright. Better get going.
3177885 3178969 My little man.
3180179 3181595 I love you.<br />I'll see you soon, okay?
3181597 3183222 - Love you!<br />- Bye!
3183224 3184264 Bye!
3195487 3196903 I think I made too much.
3196905 3197781 Mm.
3198614 3200324 More for me.
3201367 3203742 When's Tyler come home?
3203744 3205621 In two shakes<br />of a lamb's tail.
3206456 3208083 How long is that?
3209708 3213126 You know, that's what grandma<br />always used to say to me
3213128 3214711 and I never asked her.
3214713 3216630 You're one smart cookie,<br />you know that?
3216632 3218425 Why don't you go<br />visit your mom for a while?
3219677 3221135 You wanna swim<br />in grandma's lake?
3221137 3222222 Yay!
3222972 3224137 You can take time off?
3224139 3226349 Nah! I wish I could, honey.
3226351 3229059 But, um, you know,<br />swamped with work.
3229061 3230894 You go for a week or two.
3230896 3232438 I'll check on Rudy at the center
3232440 3234023 and then I'll come up<br />the last weekend
3234025 3236400 and I'll drive back down<br />with yous.
3236402 3238403 - Mom would like that.<br />- Mm.
3238405 3240198 - You wanna go see grandma?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3241199 3242075 Alright.
3243659 3245492 We'll call her after dinner<br />and tell her we're coming.
3245494 3246913 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
3264806 3266016 Sorry.
3270894 3272021 It's okay.
3283157 3285407 - Something bothering you?<br />- No.
3285409 3287325 You wanna talk about it?
3287327 3289327 I..
3289329 3290873 I'm fine, it's just..
3293376 3294794 Just getting old.
3300675 3302218 Maybe I shouldn't go to Mom's.
3306389 3307849 It's nothing.
3310809 3313103 Come here. Come on.
3323697 3325407 You don't have to worry.
3329661 3330996 Ever.
3334876 3336416 Drive safe, huh?
3336418 3338293 - Bye-bye, Daddy.<br />- Bye, sweetheart.
3338295 3339295 - Be a good girl.<br />- I'll call you when we get there.
3339297 3340545 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
3340547 3342216 - I love you. Bye-bye.<br />- Listen to your mom.
3360150 3361360 Be done by the end of the day.
3362320 3363321 Fantastic.
3377751 3379543 You ever, uh..
3379545 3381461 ...bring out<br />your service weapon?
3381463 3382921 Can't say that I have.
3382923 3384382 Yeah?
3384384 3387592 I've done a lot of target<br />shooting with the new Gen-4.
3387594 3389302 Beautiful weapon.
3389304 3391348 You'll be able to snag some<br />critter, no problem.
3393726 3395060 Mm-hmm.
3408240 3409240 Oh.
3409242 3410490 Go ahead.

3619869 3620909 Oh.
3620911 3623704 Uh... it's a nice camera.
3623706 3625040 Is that real film?
3626083 3628291 Oh, yeah. Yeah.
3628293 3630795 Oh, you-you like photography.
3631797 3633798 You were the one<br />with all those, uh
3633800 3635800 those crime scene photos
3635802 3638677 the day of the-the big fight,<br />right?
3638679 3639681 Yeah.
3640806 3642850 Here. Let me... let me<br />take one of you.
3647813 3649523 Say cheese and crackers.
3652110 3653361 Cheese and crackers.
3655447 3658657 We have to wait to see<br />how it turns out.
3660952 3662287 You wanna blow on it?
3673340 3675340 Hi, Dad. Okay!
3675342 3677093 Okay, fine! I'm on my way.
3678177 3680135 Sorry, I'm late to meet my dad.
3680137 3683180 Oh, wow. Just like that, huh?
3683182 3686059 Well, should I, should I tell<br />Tyler you came by?
3686061 3687687 Nah, forget it.
3722722 3724097 Dammit!
3827702 3829911 So here we are<br />at this pivotal scene.
3829913 3832162 The son comes to his senses
3832164 3835208 he's on the road<br />to see his father.
3835210 3837043 And before he even<br />gets to the door
3837045 3839711 the father sees him<br />from a distance.
3839713 3843467 And scripture says the father<br />runs to seek him out.
3844969 3847972 You see, God always leaves<br />the door to redemption open
3849349 3853184 but it's up to us to pull the<br />handle and come on in.
3853186 3855105 So my question<br />this morning is..
3856731 3858316 ...are you gonna open the door?
3861152 3862318 Hey, my tur... my turn.
3862320 3864153 Now, you're gonna try it.
3864155 3865737 - I know.<br />- I know. Yes.
3865739 3867155 That's what I said.
3867157 3869117 Okay. That's very good.
3869119 3871034 Anyway, Mom sends her love
3871036 3873996 and, uh, she wants you<br />to bring your tools
3873998 3877124 when you come up, 'cause<br />there's a bunch of little jobs
3877126 3879001 she has in mind for you.
3879003 3880836 Oh, someone wants to say<br />hello to you.
3880838 3882921 Hi, Daddy. I love you.
3882923 3884090 That's it, go ahead.
3884092 3886300 Okay, that's it.<br />That's all she wants to say.
3886302 3890137 I love you too,<br />and, um... call us.

4017266 4020059 I'm wanted by the cops right now<br />for robbin' a bank.
4020061 4022644 You understand? Hm?

4223847 4227224 That's what my dad<br />always told me.
4227226 4230352 But he was a real S-O-B.
4230354 4233815 Let me tell ya.
4233817 4236319 Put your hands, please.
4238529 4242365 I'll be out of here in two<br />shakes of a lamb's tail.
4246246 4247285 That's tight.

4402985 4404945 You should be gone.
4408949 4412660 Oh, Tyler.
4412662 4414077 You shouldn't see this.
4414079 4415457 Dad!
4418626 4421626 What did I teach you?
4421628 4423754 You don't aim a weapon
4423756 4426340 unless you intend to use it.
4427385 4430221 Are you gonna shoot me, bud?
4446488 4448528 You can't just leave notes<br />out for me like that.
4448530 4450449 My parents are gonna<br />find them.
4452493 4455827 I like the black eye.<br />It's a good look for you.
4455829 4457705 You should've just taken<br />the pictures, though.
4457707 4458580 I thought you were gonna stop?
4458582 4461377 I am. Come up.
4463003 4464670 This is Nora Devlin's house.
4464672 4467466 The only places I know are<br />Clovehitch places. I'm sorry.
4471054 4473638 Look, I wanna hang out with you.
4473640 4476557 But it can't be about this<br />Clovehitch stuff.
4476559 4479020 Especially not about my dad.
4481355 4484024 Okay. I get it.
4488154 4489739 But do you even believe me?
4491032 4493741 Do you really believe me?
4493743 4496079 I feel her sometimes.
4497079 4498581 What?
4499957 4501542 Let's go in.
4503752 4505544 - No.<br />- Come on.
4505546 4506672 No!
4519894 4521309 Let's go.
4559768 4562436 He, um, came in<br />through the basement.
4563854 4565939 And then tied her up..
4566815 4569318 ...and tortured her here.
4570069 4571528 Then he killed her.
4573155 4574405 This is where<br />they found the body.
4574407 4576824 Why are you doing this?
4576826 4578536 What did your dad tell you?
4582247 4583750 Tyler.
4591507 4593385 I'm not accusing your dad.
4594594 4596471 I just wanna know<br />what happened.
4607064 4608942 It was Uncle Rudy.
4610568 4612445 In the wheelchair?
4616032 4617909 How long has he been<br />like that?
4619034 4620744 Ten years.
4621996 4624082 That's why he stopped.
4628211 4630088 He told me<br />it was a car accident
4630880 4633967 but... it was suicide.
4636636 4638388 Attempted suicide.
4643059 4645936 I found something<br />in the pit under your house.
4649565 4652234 Y... you said<br />there was nothing under there.
4654863 4656780 There were rope fibers.
4657823 4660282 - Rope fibers?<br />- Yeah.
4664913 4666791 This isn't CSI.
4669336 4672919 Look, I know that you love<br />being obsessed with Clovehitch
4672921 4674714 because it makes you<br />all dark and interesting
4674716 4678595 but, but really,<br />this is my family.
4679261 4680721 He killed my mom.
4681930 4683223 What?
4685601 4689271 Clovehitch... killed my mom.
4691858 4693273 I thought, um..
4693275 4695362 I thought your mom ran away.
4698823 4699865 Yeah.
4702786 4705995 When I was five,<br />my dad came home
4705997 4708041 after a big fight with her.
4709542 4712420 And she was gone<br />and so was her stuff.
4714046 4715714 And we never heard<br />from her again.
4717341 4720010 My dad says<br />that she abandoned us.
4723847 4725725 That's not what I remember.
4727310 4731189 I remember a man coming in<br />and making her cry.
4734859 4737362 And tying her up,<br />and putting me in the bathroom.
4740948 4742866 And her screams.
4746328 4748789 I turned on the water<br />so I didn't have to hear.
4752252 4755338 And it was years later<br />that I heard about Clovehitch..
4757423 4758757 ...and I knew.
4762470 4764762 But my dad wouldn't listen,<br />no one would listen.
4764764 4769435 I didn't want it to be him,<br />so, no one's believed me.
4774274 4775942 What was her name?
4777985 4779237 Crystal.
4781905 4782948 Crystal Harper?
4788747 4790206 How do you know that?
4796503 4798172 Under the house..
4800925 4804012 ...there was a box, and<br />it had photos, and jewelry..
4806722 4808600 ...and driver's licenses.
4810810 4812479 There were 13 of them.
4819903 4821154 Thirteen?
4823030 4824698 Where are they?
4829578 4831663 It wasn't gonna bring 'em back.
4834833 4836502 And he's gone.
4839381 4841421 We had to protect our family.
4841423 4843885 - So where are they?<br />- So we burned them.
4846470 4848555 I'm sorry.
4850225 4852102 Do you believe him?
4853978 4856271 Is there any doubt in your mind?
4859567 4860819 Please.
4869953 4871827 Have a good time.
4871829 4873662 Thanks again, Dad, for coming<br />through with the money.
4873664 4876081 Eh, I figured you learned<br />all you can from me.
4876083 4878086 - Have fun.<br />- I will.
4902193 4904070 Your dad was a handyman, right?
4905029 4906987 So?
4906989 4909866 Well, it'd explain<br />why there's no forced entry.
4909868 4911745 Case his victims' houses.
4913162 4915162 Uncle Rudy<br />was a handyman too.
4931139 4933016 What are you expecting to see?
4934850 4935933 Anything.
4935935 4937143 There's no way<br />he could be that sick
4937145 4939062 and not give any hint.
4939064 4940479 I've lived with him<br />my whole life.
4940481 4942231 There's no hint.
4942233 4944319 Maybe you don't know<br />what a normal dad is like.
4946945 4949112 No, yeah, no, I feel like<br />I'm learning a lot.
4949114 4952032 And the, the counselors<br />have been really helpful
4952034 4954451 and everything's<br />been amazing so far.
4954453 4958164 Yeah, alright. Alright.<br />I gotta go, Mom.
4958166 4959668 No, I love you too.<br />I'll talk to you later.
4961127 4963169 He's following that woman.
4963171 4964128 What woman?
4964130 4966048 The woman in the blue pants.
4967841 4969510 He's staring at her.
4981814 4983692 No, no. He'll see you.<br />He'll see you.
4989238 4990698 This isn't gonna work.
4992867 4994744 What kind of phone<br />does he have?

5085668 5087543 Hi, Dad.
5087545 5091216 Yeah, I know, I know.<br />I'm on my way. Sorry.
5104354 5105814 He left the house.
5107399 5109272 He's going to work.
5109274 5112402 We should wait for him to sneak<br />out at night or something.
5112404 5114821 He's gonna see me if we keep<br />following him around
5114823 5116282 in broad daylight.
5144226 5145729 Whose house is that?
5147146 5148937 He's probably just working.
5148939 5150190 We should go.
5154069 5156153 Kassi! Kassi!
5214338 5217216 - Hey, come on.<br />- Hey.
5225516 5228518 He tied this here.<br />I saw him.
5252668 5253961 Tyler.
5255005 5256211 Tyler.
5274565 5276982 It's the woman<br />from the market.
5318275 5319318 I'll go in with you.
5320944 5322237 No.
5323573 5325617 I need to talk to him alone.
5339797 5341214 Dad?
5397564 5398979 Come on.
5549966 5551259 Dad?
5553511 5555180 What are you doin' here?
5557556 5559016 Is she okay?
5559850 5561851 You should be gone.
5561853 5563520 Oh, Tyler.
5564646 5566565 - You shouldn't see this.<br />- Dad!
5568609 5571318 What did I teach you?
5571320 5575824 You don't aim a weapon<br />unless you intend to use it.
5576993 5578870 Are you gonna shoot me, bud?
5584292 5586169 You have to turn yourself in.
5589463 5591505 - Kassi?<br />- Yeah.
5591507 5592550 Go and help her.
5601059 5603353 She's manipulating you.
5608190 5609483 Bud..
5610944 5612654 Bud, listen to me.
5613697 5615739 I'd never hurt anyone.
5617826 5620619 This, this woman<br />and I are having an affair.
5622454 5625706 We're a little kinky,<br />that's all.
5625708 5629751 I know, I know, this is a lot<br />for you to take in..
5629753 5631713 ...but your mother knows<br />all about this. She and I...
5631715 5633548 Are you serious<br />with this bullshit?
5633550 5635717 Bud, if this gets out,<br />all you're gonna do
5635719 5638135 is hurt your mom and Susie.
5638137 5639553 I need you to lower your aim.
5639555 5641598 Accidents happen.
5646895 5649022 It's okay, bud.<br />It's okay.
5649024 5650772 She was gonna hurt somebody.
5650774 5654277 You and me,<br />we know about gun safety.
5654279 5659034 Now, I trust you to properly<br />handle a firearm, but not her.
5666541 5668626 I need you<br />to lower your weapon.
5670627 5672711 Let's not become<br />another bad statistic
5672713 5674841 about gun safety.
5676384 5677844 Accidents happen.
5684975 5686226 Good man.
5688020 5690105 I'm very proud of you, bud.
5692192 5693484 Very proud.
5695194 5696818 You're doin' the right thing.
5700783 5702034 Remember..
5704787 5706455 ...butt first.
5708917 5712545 You used to think<br />that was so funny.
5714881 5716341 Butt first.
5721261 5722721 There you go.
5728520 5729979 I'm not mad.
5734859 5736569 Just disappointed.
5847514 5850391 Tyler, hurry up, please.<br />I can't be late again.
5852143 5853228 Okay.
5854395 5856271 I want pancakes.
5857981 5861733 Well, you're in luck,<br />because oatmeal is pancakes
5861735 5863443 that Big Bird chewed up.
5863445 5865823 - Gross.<br />- Sweetie, please.
5867367 5869991 I need you to be a good little<br />bug for me today, okay?
5869993 5872077 Okay, Mom.
5872079 5873957 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
5876083 5878084 Tyler!
5878086 5879460 I'm coming!
5888971 5890222 - Amen.<br />- Amen.
5896438 5899187 There's an opening<br />at Billy's uncle's shop.
5899189 5901067 I could pick up a few shifts<br />there next week.
5908073 5909366 Hello?
5910743 5912117 Yes, speaking.
5932599 5936017 I'm sorry.<br />I'm so sorry.
5967091 5969176 So what should we do now?
5971095 5972928 Nothing.
5972930 5975015 Police won't connect it<br />to Clovehitch.
5976434 5978728 She never saw his face.
5981189 5983066 Yeah.
5989863 5992157 This is what you wanted.
5998122 6003209 Mommy, I don't wanna go<br />to bed. Please!
6003211 6006923 Please! I want someone to sleep<br />with me. I don't want..
6019226 6021104 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
6026275 6028737 - Can I sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
6037871 6040123 The police wanted<br />to talk to you.
6044836 6046296 I told them no.
6047713 6049173 They..
6053427 6055512 They don't think<br />it was an accident.
6059434 6061519 Do you understand<br />what I'm saying?
6068275 6069943 They think s..
6072322 6074783 They think<br />somebody killed him?
6076201 6078744 Oh, goodness no.<br />Tyler, no.
6079703 6081206 No, they..
6082664 6086375 They think that someone
6086377 6088044 as experienced as Don
6088046 6089713 wouldn't just..
6092841 6094299 Yes, he had his problems
6094301 6099097 but... we... dealt<br />with them together.
6099099 6101848 I told them that.
6101850 6105227 Hey, hey, hey.<br />Hey, hey, hey.
6105229 6108397 It's okay. It's okay.<br />It's okay. It's okay.
6109484 6110900 It's okay.
6115407 6117281 It's okay.
6122204 6125291 Color guard,<br />post the flag of Troop 22.
6127711 6131213 Color guard, post the flag<br />of the United States of America.
6133966 6135426 Color guard, dismissed.
6141224 6144101 And now, Mrs. Burnside,<br />please present the sash.
6160743 6162785 I present to you,<br />the newest inductee
6162787 6165245 into the Order of Light,<br />Tyler Burnside.
6179720 6181013 Thank you.
6182474 6185641 Normally, the troop leader<br />would say a few words.
6185643 6188520 So, instead, I'd like to say<br />a few words about him.
6190273 6192359 Donald Burnside, my father.
6193984 6196237 We all saw different<br />sides of him.
6197697 6200658 To our community,<br />he was a leader.
6202077 6204537 To our family,<br />he was a provider.
6206122 6207999 To me, he was a dad.
6211418 6214336 As troop leader,<br />my father helped many of us
6214338 6217507 get our gun safety badges
6217509 6220970 which makes his accident<br />that much more tragic.
6226393 6231064 The truth is bad things<br />happen to good people.
6233899 6237026 Our only defense<br />is to come together
6237028 6238320 like we've done tonight.
6254378 6257338 That's what my dad taught me
6257340 6259300 through how he lived.
6264180 6266347 Let's remember that..
6266349 6269644 ...how he impacted our lives.
6309559 6312893 Dad, if you can hear me..
6347930 6349390 ...I love you.
