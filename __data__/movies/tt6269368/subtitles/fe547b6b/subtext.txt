28403 31066 [Tyler] The first murder<br />happened before I was born.
34910 37618 The killer called himself Clovehitch
37621 39328 after his favorite type of knot.
42251 43662 Our town lived in fear.
46255 49293 And then, 10 years ago, he stopped.
52844 55211 Every year, our community had a memorial
55222 57339 for friends and family of the victims.
61144 63932 At the time, I didn't think about it much.
69528 72236 (birds chirping)
73574 75861 Someone has to be leading the detail.
77286 78286 Why?
78996 79996 Anyone?
81540 84078 To keep everyone in<br />step, that's number one.
84084 86451 Number two, here, stand up, come here.
86461 88498 In my day, what we did was,
89423 91210 flag up, shoulders back.
91216 92673 Put your shoulders back.
92676 94087 There you go.
94094 96552 Now, if it's windy on that day,
96555 98012 what's his other arm gonna do?
98932 100594 - Steady the flag.<br />- Right.
100601 102593 Then on the day, you two, come up here.
104396 105396 Side to side.
106690 110104 Your job is you're<br />gonna, you're gonna push.
111153 113019 Here, right?
113030 114521 Shoulder to shoulder.
114531 117023 You're gonna keep that formation<br />solid for the flag bearer
117034 120198 who's got the weight<br />of the flag plus wind.
127002 127958 Very, very nice.
127961 129327 Okay, great job, have a seat.
131423 135793 How about giving them a round of applause?
135802 138169 (applauding)
139890 142098 (grunting)
145354 146970 (groans)
146980 150894 Hey, bud, I, uh, I've been<br />meaning to talk to you.
153111 156024 (sighing)
156031 158239 Work's been slow and, uh,
158241 160779 Uncle Rudy's insurance<br />is going up, so I can't,
160786 162527 I can't send you to leadership camp.
165707 168450 Yeah, but I, I need it to<br />stand out on my application.
168460 169951 That's what the recruiter said.
171171 173458 Yeah, it's just, um,<br />you know, we're gonna,
173465 175001 we're gonna work on your rank together.
175008 176965 It's just gonna take a bit longer
176968 178925 before you're flyin' around at Mach one.
182432 183432 Oh.
186770 188261 - Let me get that.<br />- No, I got it.
188271 190763 Yeah, I got it, I got it, I got it.
194277 195859 Oh, no!
195862 198605 Oh-ho, we got him. (laughs)
198615 201904 You may be getting taller, but<br />I can still kick your butt.
201910 203867 - Quit.<br />- Say it.
203870 205077 - No!<br />- Say it.
207290 209202 Say it.<br />- Uncle.
209209 210416 There you go.

317859 320192 Yeah, my dad said I can't<br />get a car until I'm 18.
320195 322152 - Oh, really?<br />- Yeah, 'cause you know,
322155 324488 teenage drivers are the most deadly.
324491 328110 (both chuckle nervously)<br />- Yeah, oh, yeah, that...

397856 400473 No, no, I...
400483 402395 I don't even know where this came from.
403361 405227 Okay, well, it's your truck.
405238 406570 Yeah, but this isn't mine.
408658 411071 Really, no, this, this isn't mine.
411077 412077 It's gross.<br />- Okay.
418043 418908 Um, I'm sorry.
418919 421662 Do you wanna keep going?<br />- No, it's getting kinda late.

439105 440516 You see how tall you're getting?
440523 443106 Honey, she's taller than<br />Tyler was at the same age.
443109 444190 It's all the growth hormones
444194 445685 I've been adding to the batter.
446613 450027 - Tyler, hurry up!<br />- Sorry, mom.
450033 451820 - Woo-oop!<br />- One more for me.
454788 455788 There we go.
459417 460874 - Amen.<br />- Amen.
460877 462368 Let's eat.
462379 464371 Are you gonna have time<br />to pick up Uncle Rudy?
464381 465838 We gotta take separate cars.
465840 466956 I can't find my keys.
466967 468208 Tyler, have you seen my keys?
468218 470926 - Mm-mm.<br />- We gotta go, eat.
470929 473171 Stuff your faces.<br />- Mmm.
473181 475013 - Oh!<br />- This is good.
475016 477053 Is that, is that delicious or what?
477060 479518 If you say so yourself.<br />(both laughing)
479521 480728 [Don] What?
480730 481730 Hey, Rudy?

531239 532239 She's here again.
534743 536029 Who cares?
536036 537572 Just what is she doing?
537579 538615 Planning a church shooting or something?
538621 541284 She's not planning a church shooting.
541291 542623 She's not Christian.
542625 543625 She's sick.
544878 546289 I know her from school.
546296 547457 She always does the same report
547464 548921 about the killings every year.
551009 552591 What, do you have a<br />crush on her or something?
552594 555302 (scoffs) That's disgusting.
555305 556512 Don't you know she did it with, like,
556514 557846 five different football players
557849 560808 because her mom left the<br />family to be a stripper?
560810 561891 We should pray for her.
563229 564470 Or maybe call the cops.
564481 566017 Tyler, you can speak with Billy later.
566024 567515 We have rounds to do.
567525 569016 - I'll see you later.<br />- See ya.
573323 576111 (girls giggling)
576117 578234 (car engine humming)<br />- And remember,
578244 580531 Daniel is showing us not only faith,
580538 582120 but he's showing us the kind of faith
582123 584911 that can cope with Babylonian captivity.
584918 586534 (cell phone vibrating)<br />You see, in order
586544 588957 to live in Babylon, Daniel<br />lived his whole life.
588963 590374 He was like a layman, he wasn't like a...
590381 592748 - Put that away, please.<br />- Like Jeremiah.
592759 594500 He was a layman.
594511 598255 He lived his whole life in the<br />arena of Babylonian politics.
598264 600096 It was just as hostile a world
600100 601216 as you could possibly live in.
601226 603639 How come dad doesn't have<br />to help with couponing?
603645 605682 Because your father has his own hobbies.
607565 609602 What did you think of the sermon today?
609609 612443 (cell phone vibrates)
612445 613856 [Man On Radio] Without reservation
613863 615855 he believed in the power of God.
615865 618198 That's why he made that<br />appointment with Nebuchadnezzar.
618201 619032 He said...
619035 620446 You're addicted to this thing.
620453 623662 I don't like it.<br />- I need to see that.
623665 626078 (cell phone vibrates)<br />(Cindy scoffs)

630713 632921 (cell phone vibrates)<br />- Daniel believed
632924 634290 in the power of prayer
634300 635131 absolutely.<br />- Nothing.

677886 679468 Is this about the photo?
679470 681427 No, I texted like one<br />person who I thought
681431 682467 would never tell.<br />- What?
682473 684715 I don't even know what that was.
684726 686058 It wasn't mine, okay?

690398 692185 And then you show up at<br />this and parade around

693193 694980 it's not mine.
694986 695942 You have to believe me.
695945 697561 You gotta tell everyone the truth.
698907 703151 (Amy scoffs)<br />You'll tell 'em, right?
704078 706661 [Kassi] What'd you do to<br />piss off all your little pals?
708791 710578 [Tyler] Someone's been<br />spreading a rumor about me.
710585 711450 It's not true.
711461 713202 Teenage drama.
713213 714213 Must be hard.
716549 718040 You know, I've heard about you.
718051 718882 You're into this stuff.
718885 719885 It's sick.
720762 722503 Yeah, I heard about you too.
723640 724640 Perv.
730230 731687 (kids chattering)
731689 733476 [Girl] Give it back!
735693 737559 [Boy] No, it doesn't!

744577 746785 What do you think this is, huh?
746788 747778 You can't do all this.
747789 749405 You wanna dance, huh?
749415 750775 Wanna dance, dance, dance with me?

1053344 1055506 online finishing up some school stuff.
1056722 1058839 (sighing)
1060518 1062180 I am very disappointed.
1063938 1065930 - Um, mom...<br />- Go to bed.
1067817 1068817 Mom.
1070319 1071355 Go to bed, Tyler.
1074615 1075615 Yes, ma'am.
1083291 1085533 (sighing)
1085543 1088081 (somber music)
1095469 1098337 (knocking on door)
1117450 1119442 Mom says we have to have a little talk.
1121454 1122454 Have a seat.
1135426 1137713 (sighing) Our secret.
1139555 1140716 Just the men folk.
1146646 1148888 I've been keeping another<br />secret for you, bud.
1153986 1156069 I know you took my truck the other night.
1159950 1162488 Mom worries about you<br />driving, 'cause of Uncle Rudy,
1162495 1163736 but I figure you're old enough
1163746 1164953 to sneak out once or twice.
1164955 1166821 But now we have to<br />straighten a few things out
1166832 1168368 that might be confusing you.
1170169 1172411 Like what you're looking<br />at on the computer at...
1172421 1173957 I wasn't looking at anything.
1178594 1179594 Okay.
1183641 1184641 Sex.
1188229 1189229 There, I said it.
1193484 1194565 (Tyler sighing)
1194568 1197561 You know we're made in God's image.
1198781 1202866 That means your body is a holy thing
1203828 1205945 not to be desecrated.
1205955 1207162 You know what that means?
1208499 1210491 But, men like you and me,
1212002 1213209 we got thoughts.
1214338 1216330 We got thoughts that start to (chuckles),
1217633 1219215 start to pop into our heads.
1219218 1221631 You ever get those thoughts, bud?
1221637 1223128 Thoughts about girls?
1224181 1226013 (chuckles) I get it.
1226016 1229134 I mean, believe it or not, I was 16 once.
1230980 1232812 We're in a bit of a pickle, aren't we?
1234734 1237898 We got God over here on this side
1237903 1241317 and we got a sex-crazed<br />monkey over here on this side.
1242533 1243740 You with me so far, bud?
1245077 1246077 Not really.
1250916 1251916 Here's the thing.
1255379 1258543 It's okay to have thoughts.
1259550 1261837 That's just a fantasy.
1261844 1263005 God will look the other way.
1263012 1264719 He's a busy man.
1264722 1267055 But no pictures.
1269018 1270018 Got it?
1273898 1277812 A fantasy's okay, it's<br />not real, it's just...
1277818 1279605 It's just monkey stuff.
1280488 1283356 You can't control what<br />pops into your head, right?
1283365 1284276 I mean, what if a thought popped
1284283 1285819 into your head right now, a bad thought?
1285826 1288694 Something like, I don't know...
1288704 1290320 You know, grabbing one of these,
1290331 1292243 these tools in here and wham!
1293709 1296326 You'd never do it in real life, right?
1296337 1297828 Never. (chuckles)
1297838 1300251 It's just, just monkey stuff, right?
1301759 1303341 Yeah, monkey stuff.
1305930 1308172 Oh, there.
1310017 1311017 We did it.
1312520 1315433 Awkward talk with Dad over.
1317316 1319854 - Car wash!<br />- Car wash.
1319860 1322819 (suspenseful music)
1328869 1330531 Can I talk to you about something?
1330538 1332655 (scoffs) I told you, I'm busy.
1332665 1333906 Come on, one minute.
1342550 1344337 The reason I had that thing that Amy saw
1344343 1345800 wasn't what you think.
1345803 1348045 I'm trying not to think about it.
1348055 1350843 I don't like that stuff at all.
1350850 1353388 It's shown me something, something bad.
1353394 1355135 Something that I, I<br />can't get out of my head.
1355145 1356431 I, I know it's probably not true,
1356438 1357428 but I think I just need
1357439 1358805 to talk to somebody about it because...
1358816 1360853 I'm gonna stop you right there.
1360860 1361691 I know where you're going with this
1361694 1363310 and I'm not going to discuss it.
1363320 1364982 - What?<br />- It's a sin.
1364989 1366730 And you have a choice.
1366740 1369153 - Billy, come on.<br />- It's a choice.
1369159 1370366 I'm not even gonna.
1371328 1374287 (suspenseful music)
1434558 1436158 [Kassi] The fuck you following me for?
1437895 1439102 You remember me, right?
1440481 1441562 Tyler the perv.
1442900 1443900 How's the perving?
1446028 1446859 Why are you always reading
1446862 1448478 the newspaper outside of our church?
1449406 1450406 I like bad news.
1453160 1454276 Okay.
1454286 1456824 And I can sit wherever I want.
1456830 1458287 I thought you people were<br />supposed to be all friendly
1458290 1459952 and giving and shit?
1459959 1461200 No, of...
1461210 1462826 No, yeah, no, it's totally fine.
1464505 1465505 Great.
1467216 1469879 Hey, um, you know about<br />that Clovehitch stuff, right?
1469885 1471217 'Cause I was thinking maybe
1471220 1472427 I could ask you a few questions,
1472429 1474170 'cause I was on some bad website and...
1474181 1475843 Oh, I get it.
1475849 1478136 (laughing) You heard that rumor
1479019 1481762 about me and the five<br />guys on the football team.
1481772 1482603 And you thought that if you
1482606 1483938 came out here...<br />- No, no no no.
1483941 1485352 It's okay.
1485359 1487817 I'm a slut, you're a perv.
1487820 1489152 We were made for each other.
1490197 1492063 - Okay, cut it out.<br />- So serious.
1492992 1493823 No one will know.
1493826 1495158 It's just you and me down here.
1498706 1499706 Whip it out.
1500624 1502206 Let's see what we're dealing with.
1505546 1507287 I'm fucking with you!
1507297 1509755 - No, I know, I really...<br />- Do you?
1509758 1511499 Wait, no, no, I really, I just,
1511510 1512842 I wanna know about Clovehitch.
1512845 1514052 That's all, really.
1514054 1515170 Just like the suspects, and,
1515180 1516887 and how you could eliminate
1516890 1518051 certain suspects.<br />- Why?
1519059 1522302 Why do you all of a sudden<br />care about this stuff?
1522312 1524053 Are you trying to convert me?
1524064 1526397 Or is this for a merit badge?<br />- No!
1526400 1528642 No, I, I don't know.
1528652 1530063 It's just stuck in my head.
1531280 1533363 I just went to the memorial the other day
1533365 1536733 and I didn't know any of them, but, still.
1536744 1538326 I thought maybe talking to you about it
1538328 1539944 could help or something.
1541123 1542910 But I don't know, it's<br />probably just stupid.
1542916 1543952 It's not stupid.
1546253 1550293 Come here after 3:00.<br />(paper ripping)
1550299 1551299 I'll help you.
1553552 1555259 (sighing)
1555262 1556262 Bring cookies.
1561560 1564428 (brakes squeaking)
1574573 1575573 Can I help you?
1576283 1577273 Uh, I'm sorry, ma'am.
1577284 1578365 I'm looking for Kassi.
1581413 1582413 I brought cookies.
1585459 1587576 Kassi, your little friend is here.
1591590 1593832 [Kassi] Didn't think you'd show.
1593842 1595925 Your grandma's interesting.
1595928 1597635 (scoffs) She's not my grandma.
1598722 1599803 Dumbass.
1599807 1601764 She used to work for the cops.
1601767 1605681 She made a copy of all their<br />files and wrote this book.
1606730 1607730 Sit.
1614905 1618945 And here's everything on<br />his 10 official victims.
1623539 1626282 This is victim number eight, Erica Lytle.
1626291 1628499 She was a fifth grade teacher.
1628502 1630459 Clovehitch knew when she would be alone.
1632589 1634046 Sorry, it's pretty graphic.
1635175 1637041 [Tyler] Did they take<br />any Polaroid pictures?
1637052 1638759 [Kassi] No, it's all digital, why?
1639930 1641387 So this is all the evidence?
1642516 1643927 There's not much.
1643934 1647098 No fingerprints, no blood,<br />no semen, just the rope.
1647104 1648720 Well, rope fibers.
1648730 1649891 And this.
1649898 1652231 Belonged to victim four, Sasha Peterson.
1652234 1654692 Found outside First Baptist.
1654695 1657062 She never went there, I checked.
1657072 1659940 So you were staking out our church to...
1659950 1662658 What, narrow it down,<br />whoever was going back there?
1663579 1665115 No, the cops already did that.
1666540 1668748 I'm using the FBI playbook.
1668750 1670662 I'm gonna catch him using his weakness.
1670669 1672080 And what's that?
1672087 1673919 He's insane.
1673922 1676380 Every killer has an MO<br />tied to his psychology.
1676383 1678124 It's like a fingerprint.
1678135 1678966 Look.
1678969 1682679 Same entry points, same<br />elaborate ropes on the bodies
1682681 1686220 the clove hitch tied to every<br />victim's house, his signature.
1686226 1689560 He's taunting the cops, using<br />the victims as trophies.
1689563 1691225 It's meticulous and planned.
1692399 1695267 I'm gonna use that fingerprint<br />to connect him to new cases.
1696486 1698648 I don't think he's stopped killing.
1698655 1701193 I think there's more than 10 victims.
1701200 1702200 But he has stopped.
1703577 1705364 Serial killers can't stop.
1710083 1711870 [Cindy] This one, or this one?
1713128 1714335 This one, okay.
1717841 1720754 (clears throat) You know, I<br />was thinkin' of volunteering.
1722346 1723346 [Cindy] Mm-hmm.
1724723 1726305 Maybe, uh, doing some tutoring
1727935 1729051 during the afternoons.
1731104 1732891 Where would that be?
1732898 1734184 Oh, over at St. Joseph's.
1735275 1737312 I was talkin' to Billy's friend Martin.
1737319 1738560 He goes there.
1739529 1740861 I think you met him a couple years ago.
1740864 1741980 He's a really nice guy.
1741990 1743947 We donated to their food drive, I think.
1746703 1748615 Well, that's very<br />generous of you, Tyler,
1748622 1750079 but, keep it to afternoons.
1750082 1751948 Evenings is family time.
1751959 1752959 Yes, ma'am.
1759967 1761299 - No!<br />- Gin.
1761301 1763008 - No!<br />- No!
1763011 1764923 - Cheating!<br />- How about that?
1764930 1766592 - Again?<br />- Don't hate me
1766598 1770467 'cause I'm beautiful.<br />(kettle whistling)
1790038 1792576 (somber music)
1831330 1832912 You can pull the wool<br />over your mother's eyes,
1832914 1833914 but not mine.
1837502 1838413 Who was it you were visiting
1838420 1840036 when you're supposed to be tutoring?
1844217 1846334 (sighing)
1847554 1849716 My boy's got himself a girlfriend.
1851725 1852886 (chuckles)
1852893 1853893 Oh.
1854686 1855686 You know about that?
1858982 1860848 Problem is, you lied to your mother.
1862527 1864894 Oh, we...
1865864 1868527 We really just study, that's all.
1868533 1871276 Remember what we talked about before?
1871286 1872493 No, her grandma's there.
1872496 1875785 It's, it's not like that.<br />- I know, I know.
1875791 1876791 Tell you what.
1877709 1879120 Mom doesn't have to know you're lying,
1879127 1880834 but she needs to meet this girl.
1880837 1883705 Invite her over for dinner tomorrow night.
1883715 1885297 I don't know if that's a good idea.
1885300 1887132 I'll have her make her a casserole.
1888053 1889214 Okay, yes, sir.
1904277 1908738 Hey, would you wanna go to<br />dinner tonight at my house?
1910200 1911782 No.
1911785 1913401 My parents wanna meet you.
1915455 1918163 - Why?<br />- Um...
1919209 1921542 They think we're going out and, uh...
1921545 1922752 Whoa.
1922754 1924711 What?<br />- Hm?
1924714 1927081 You know we're not going out, right?
1927092 1928092 Yeah, no.
1928802 1930168 No, of course.
1930178 1931794 No, no, no, duh, obviously.
1931805 1933717 I just thought...
1933723 1934839 You know, they just,
1934850 1936557 they know we're hanging out, and so...
1936560 1937676 They're not gonna try to convert me
1937686 1939018 to the ways of Jesus, are they?
1939020 1941057 The only thing would be<br />don't talk about Clovehitch,
1941064 1943306 'cause they don't know about<br />anything like that, but,
1944276 1946108 I mean, don't talk about anything.
1947487 1949444 Great, I'm definitely coming.
1952242 1954450 [Don] Mmm, great tilapia, hon.
1955412 1957745 [Cindy] So, Kassi,<br />where do you go to church?
1957747 1959989 Oh, I don't go to church.
1960000 1962708 Um, my dad's usually hungover on Sundays
1962711 1964202 and my mom left when I was little.
1964212 1967796 So, um, I'm basically an atheist,
1967799 1969711 but I'm considering getting into Wicca.
1971928 1974261 Wicca, wha, no, I've heard of that.
1974264 1977974 It, it's not black magic, it's um,
1977976 1980218 a nature-based spiritual...<br />- Oh, mom.
1980228 1982094 She's, she's just joking.<br />- Oh, geez.
1983064 1985181 This family doesn't<br />have your sense of humor.
1985192 1987809 Um, she goes to a church across town.
1987819 1991904 Kassi, I hear that, um,<br />you visit an elderly lady?
1991907 1994194 Um, yeah, she is a retired.
1994201 1995442 She used to...<br />- That's her grandma.
1995452 1996442 Mavis, yeah.
1996453 1998445 She's a retired secretary at the bank.
1998455 2001163 Tyler, let her answer for herself.
2002209 2004576 Was he this nervous when<br />he asked you out, Kassi?
2004586 2005918 Oh, no.
2005921 2006707 Not at all.
2006713 2007713 He was real smooth.
2008924 2010131 Incredible.
2010133 2013251 So smooth, I didn't<br />realize that he had asked.
2013261 2015423 Oh, I think I know<br />exactly what you mean.
2015430 2017092 This one over here's the same way.
2018308 2020300 I practically proposed to him myself.
2020310 2021266 Oh, come on.
2021269 2023511 I had that whole ring and speech
2023522 2024763 and I did the one knee.
2024773 2026810 You exaggerate.<br />- Oh, you did great.
2026816 2028557 - Come on.<br />- You did great.
2030445 2031435 (clears throat)
2031446 2033358 So, Mr. Burnside, um,
2033365 2034697 you teach Tyler and everybody
2034699 2037032 about camping and whittling...
2037035 2038571 (coughing)
2038578 2039578 Tying knots?
2043291 2044623 Well, Kassi, it's not just
2044626 2046663 about outdoor preparedness anymore.
2046670 2050505 You know, they got, they<br />got badges now for, um,
2050507 2054000 computer programming and, and photography.
2054010 2055126 All kinds of things.
2055136 2057879 But, yeah, I love whittling and knots.
2057889 2059096 You got me.
2059099 2061466 (Kassi chuckles)
2061476 2063638 How many knots do you know?
2063645 2065227 Why don't we talk about something else?
2065230 2066641 (chuckles nervously)
2066648 2069265 This, this is pretty boring.
2069276 2070276 Well, she asked.
2078368 2080405 I'm sorry about the bad joke earlier.
2081454 2083821 I really like spending time with Tyler.
2083832 2086074 I wouldn't wanna give the<br />wrong first impression.
2086084 2089168 I just get really nervous<br />and say the wrong thing.
2089170 2091082 I'm sorry.<br />- Oh.
2092090 2094047 Not at all, sweetheart, not at all.
2094050 2096212 And you don't need to be nervous.
2096219 2099633 You are the best young lady
2099639 2101596 that he has brought home to meet us.
2101600 2102966 (Kassi giggles)
2102976 2104888 - Also the only one.<br />- Don.
2104894 2107056 (laughing)
2111610 2113226 [Tyler] Sorry about<br />the whole fish thing.
2113236 2116354 I, I don't even think<br />they know what vegan is.
2116364 2117364 Pull over.
2133548 2134548 So...
2139929 2142763 You think your dad is Clovehitch?
2146686 2148894 (laughing)
2151858 2154100 You should see your face!
2154110 2155271 (laughing)
2155278 2157270 It's not your fucking dad.
2158907 2160648 Your dad?
2160659 2161991 He has pictures.
2163453 2165319 - Tyler...<br />- Like bondage porno stuff.
2166623 2168535 That's why everyone thinks I'm a perv.
2171002 2172584 I went in his shed<br />where no one is allowed,
2172587 2173748 and there was more.
2173755 2175963 There was even one that<br />said Nora on it, and,
2177175 2178791 I think that was for Nora Devlin.
2179886 2182344 Right next to it, it says,<br />Lucky's favorite on it.
2183348 2184759 I'm serious.
2184766 2186177 - Lucky?<br />- Yeah.
2187352 2189765 (laughing)
2189771 2191854 There's no way in hell<br />your dad is Clovehitch
2191856 2193472 just because he likes weird porn.
2194776 2196392 He's just kinky.
2196403 2198690 (giggling)
2198697 2199697 Oh my gosh.
2204077 2205613 Come on, let's go.
2205620 2207407 What, did you think we<br />were gonna make out?
2207414 2208414 Drive.<br />- Oh.
2212669 2215457 (truck engine hums)

2240530 2244023 that I've never seen in<br />my entire life, mister.
2244033 2248152 (somber music drowns out singing)
2255128 2259088 (persistent knocking on window)
2269350 2270181 What the heck?
2270185 2271301 What are you doing here?
2271311 2273348 Lucky got stuck in my head.
2273354 2274185 I couldn't...<br />- Shh!
2274189 2275145 I couldn't sleep.
2275148 2277185 So I went through everything,<br />and I went back to Barbara's,
2277192 2278558 which she was not happy about,
2278568 2279729 but I found it.
2279736 2282069 Victim number five, she<br />got a note in her mailbox
2282071 2284108 a week before she was killed.
2284115 2285481 Guess what it said?
2286409 2288526 (sighing)
2292832 2295791 (suspenseful music)
2302342 2305585 It's gone.<br />(dog barking)
2305595 2306595 Let's go.
2309974 2310974 Let me see.
2313228 2314560 Are you sure it said Lucky?
2315522 2317263 - I don't know.<br />- I feel something.
2318441 2319441 Oh, hey.
2322278 2323985 Shit.<br />- What is that?
2323988 2326605 (ominous music)
2339420 2342413 Does that look like your<br />father's handwriting, Tyler?
2345134 2346134 I don't know.
2348012 2349012 Where is this?
2353643 2355600 [Tyler] My dad will be up soon.
2355603 2357390 Come to Barbara's as soon as you can.
2357397 2359059 Don't let him know you know, okay?
2360650 2361650 You okay?
2363903 2364903 You okay?
2365780 2366780 Yeah.
2392056 2394924 (insects chirping)
2427717 2430300 (ominous music)
2473638 2475595 (gasps)
2585875 2587537 (knocking on door)<br />- Tyler?
2591506 2592622 Morning, sunshine.
2593633 2594633 Oh, hey, Dad.
2595843 2598506 What time is it?<br />- Almost 7:00.
2598513 2600049 Thought we'd get an early start.
2601682 2602672 What?
2602683 2605096 You know what we<br />haven't done in a while?
2605103 2607390 Camping, just you and me.
2609148 2611606 - Um, yeah, today?<br />- Yeah.
2612735 2614567 Thought we'd go have some fun.
2614570 2616277 Father-son bonding.
2616280 2617816 Lock up that rifle badge.
2619075 2620111 Yeah, no, that'd be great.
2620118 2621404 I just feel kinda sick, though.
2621410 2622696 Ah, come on.
2622703 2624410 I'll make you some cereal.
2624413 2625413 Get dressed.
2632588 2635126 (somber music)
2669167 2670829 Where are we going?
2670835 2672121 We're almost there, bud.
2708956 2710572 Did you tell anyone?
2718090 2719251 Did you tell anyone?
2723221 2725008 - What are you talking about?<br />- Tyler.
2727975 2731434 I know you've been in the<br />shed and in the crawlspace.
2733564 2736523 You had no business invading my privacy.
2737485 2741320 The lack of respect is<br />really disturbing, Tyler.
2741322 2742563 You know better than that.
2744659 2746651 There's a lock on that door for a reason.
2753626 2757085 What you found in that box wasn't mine.
2761467 2762467 Whose is it?
2770476 2771476 Rudy's.
2775147 2776147 Uncle Rudy?
2779026 2780813 The truth is, I'm ashamed to say,
2785992 2789281 I had an interest in those kinds of photos
2789287 2791995 that you found in the truck<br />a long time ago, years ago.
2794542 2797501 Rudy was the same way,<br />only much, much worse.
2798879 2801121 I knew that from when<br />we were kids, but still.
2802425 2804758 When I found that stuff in his trailer,
2804760 2806296 I went to him and I said,
2806304 2809263 "Rudy, you gotta turn yourself in."
2813769 2817979 But then, then he tried to you know...
2826282 2828069 I thought it was a car crash.
2828075 2829075 It was.
2830161 2831197 He drove off the road.
2840296 2842629 Well, why do you have that stuff?
2842631 2843667 I was gonna burn it.
2845092 2848085 I swear to God, I was gonna burn it.
2852600 2857095 But the victims' families,<br />they have a right to know.
2860399 2863062 Look, then it was never<br />the right time, you know?
2863069 2866312 Susie being born, or<br />some darn thing and...
2866322 2867779 Then I had to think about our family.
2867782 2869114 It'd be rough on you kids.
2870117 2871699 And to put your mom through that?
2874121 2875121 For what?
2877583 2879040 Not gonna bring anybody back.
2881837 2883294 But it looks like it's you.
2885132 2886132 Bud.
2889261 2891924 Bud, I don't know, I don't<br />know what else to tell you,
2897561 2902352 other than I know that<br />you know it isn't me.
2905861 2906861 It's not me.
2911200 2912200 I'm just so...
2915287 2917324 I'm just so damned sorry to,
2917331 2918697 to put you through all that.
2921961 2922961 I messed up.
2925714 2927421 I was trying to protect my brother.
2934890 2937553 We have to take it to the police,
2937560 2938892 or destroy it,
2938894 2940010 but you have to decide.
2947361 2949899 (somber music)
2996118 2998701 Knot tying exemplifies the skills
2998704 3002288 and the strength of a troop or a family.
3002291 3004908 The rope weaves the fibers together
3004919 3009004 and the knot bends them<br />to a common purpose.
3009006 3012875 The square knot used in<br />first aid is a symbol
3012885 3014342 of service to others.
3018015 3019426 - You went camping?<br />- You can't be, what?
3019433 3021140 I waited and waited<br />and I go by your house
3021143 3021974 and your mom tells me you went camping.
3021977 3023718 Shh, you talked to my mom?
3023729 3024560 I thought he was onto us.
3024563 3026976 No, keep your voice down, no.
3026982 3028098 He just wanted to take me camping, okay?
3028108 3029440 Good, because I figured it out.
3029443 3030274 It's your house.<br />- What?
3030277 3031358 Duh, there's a pit under there.
3031362 3033069 - You went under my house?<br />- I couldn't wait.
3033072 3034153 What if he took you camping
3034156 3035237 to get rid of you?<br />- Did you find
3035241 3036197 anything under there?
3036200 3037031 - No, he never finished it.<br />- Kassi!
3037034 3038570 That's 'cause it's not him.
3038577 3040944 I asked him about the<br />pictures and everything
3040955 3041786 and he explained it to me.
3041789 3043701 What, how did he explain the blueprints?
3045084 3047041 It's a fantasy, it's not real.
3047044 3050503 - What about Lucky?<br />- I gotta go back inside.
3050506 3052088 Just believe me that it's not.
3052091 3053457 - Well, then who is it?<br />- I don't know.
3053467 3054298 I'll call you later.<br />- I know you
3054301 3056384 don't wanna believe it, but just face it.
3056387 3057798 Look at this, this really happened.
3057805 3060673 No, I don't wanna deal with this!
3064144 3067057 - What are you doing?<br />- Billy, go back inside.
3067064 3068350 Hey, give me that.
3068357 3069564 You're disgusting, you know that?
3069567 3071684 - Billy, come on.<br />- This is depraved.
3071694 3072525 - Billy, give me it!<br />- Why don't you just
3072528 3074315 come out of the closet already?
3074321 3075528 - Hey.<br />- F you, slut!
3078158 3079023 Hey!
3079034 3079865 (grunting)
3079868 3081279 - Hey!<br />- Get off of me!
3081287 3082653 [Kassi] Hey!
3082663 3083663 Stop!
3087084 3088084 [Randy] Hey, buddy.
3089962 3091498 I just got one question for you.
3093048 3094289 Where's Tyler Burnside?
3097344 3099836 What?
3099847 3101884 Where's Tyler Burnside?
3101890 3103973 'Cause the Tyler I know<br />wouldn't resort to violence
3103976 3106263 to settle his disputes.
3106270 3107556 Okay, I get it.
3107563 3109179 Pastor Randy, I'm Tyler.
3110524 3111765 I just lost my temper.
3113902 3115814 You know, that's gonna be some shiner.
3117865 3119026 Everything okay at home?
3127249 3128249 Yeah, it's fine.
3133464 3136252 (window clicking)
3144725 3147183 (somber music)
3147186 3149348 [Cindy] Oh, I love you so much.
3149355 3152974 Please be careful, okay?<br />- Mom, don't worry, I will.
3152983 3156693 (groans) You're getting so heavy!
3156695 3158937 I'm gonna get real fat when you're gone
3158947 3160779 so you don't recognize me.
3160783 3164447 (laughing)<br />- Alright.
3164453 3165944 Have a good time.
3165954 3168662 Thanks again, Dad, for<br />coming through with the money.
3168666 3171784 Eh, I figure you learned<br />all you can from me.
3171794 3173410 Have fun.
3173420 3174420 I will.
3175881 3177998 Alright, better get going.
3179051 3181008 My little man.
3181011 3182468 I love you, I'll see you soon, okay?
3182471 3184087 - Love you!<br />- Bye!
3184098 3185098 Bye!
3186141 3188679 (somber music)
3196568 3197684 I think I made too much.
3197695 3198695 Mm.
3199613 3200613 More for me.
3202241 3203652 When's Tyler come home?
3204743 3206359 In two shakes of a lamb's tail.
3207413 3208870 How long is that?
3210541 3213830 You know, that's what grandma<br />always used to say to me
3213836 3215577 and I never asked her.
3215587 3217328 You're one smart cookie, you know that?
3217339 3218170 (Susie giggles)
3218173 3219973 Why don't you go visit<br />your mom for a while?
3220592 3222174 You wanna swim in grandma's lake?
3222177 3223793 Yay!
3223804 3227343 - You can take time off?<br />- Nah, I wish I could, honey.
3227349 3230012 But, um, you know, swamped with work.
3230018 3231850 You go for a week or two.
3231854 3233265 I'll check on Rudy at the center
3233272 3234888 and then I'll come up the last weekend
3234898 3237185 and I'll drive back down with yous.
3237192 3239479 - Mom would like that.<br />- Mm.
3239486 3242069 - You wanna go see grandma?<br />- Mm-hmm.
3242072 3243072 Alright.
3244700 3246487 We'll call her after dinner<br />and tell her we're coming.
3246493 3251454 - Okay.<br />- Okay.
3252166 3254954 (heavy breathing)
3259882 3262044 (groaning)
3265804 3266804 Sorry.
3271977 3272977 It's okay.
3275522 3277639 (sighing)
3284031 3285647 Something bothering you?<br />- No.
3286700 3290068 - You wanna talk about it?<br />- I...
3290078 3292320 I'm fine, it's just...
3292331 3295574 (snickers) Just getting old.
3301632 3303168 Maybe I shouldn't go to Mom's.
3307471 3308471 It's nothing.
3311767 3313884 Come here, come on.
3324696 3326028 You don't have to worry.
3330619 3331619 Ever.
3336083 3337540 Drive safe, huh?
3337543 3338954 - Bye-bye, Daddy.<br />- Bye, sweetheart.
3338961 3340247 Be a good girl.<br />- I'll call you when
3340254 3341085 we get there.<br />- Okay.
3341088 3341919 - Okay.<br />- I love you!
3341922 3343413 - Listen to your mom.<br />- Bye-bye!
3345342 3347299 (sighs)
3361066 3363103 Be done by the end of the day.
3363110 3364110 Fantastic.
3378917 3380203 You ever, uh,
3380210 3382452 bring out your service weapon?
3382462 3383794 Can't say that I have.
3383797 3385083 Yeah?
3385090 3388458 I've done a lot of target<br />shooting with the new Gen-4.
3388468 3390209 Beautiful weapon.
3390220 3392553 You'll be able to snag<br />some critter, no problem.
3394516 3396052 [Officer] Mm-hmm.
3399354 3401471 (sighing)
3409406 3410613 Oh.<br />(Don laughing)
3410616 3412573 Go ahead.<br />- I, I'll grab you one.
3413660 3415117 Gee, thank you.
3415120 3417988 There you go.
3418999 3419999 Alright.
3427883 3430125 (people chattering)<br />(scanners beeping)
3430135 3431342 Ah, they're for my wife.

3595217 3597459 We haven't seen you in a while.
3597469 3599426 [Kassi] (chuckles)<br />I'm looking for Tyler.
3599429 3600260 Tyler?
3600263 3601424 Um, well, hey, come on.
3601431 3602467 Why don't you come in?
3604976 3608310 Would, um, would you like<br />to have anything to drink?
3608313 3610100 [Kassi] Oh, no, thanks.
3610107 3613350 Um, is Tyler home?<br />- Tyler?
3613360 3614817 Oh, didn't he tell you
3614820 3617403 he was going away to leadership camp?
3617405 3620068 Oh, um, we haven't been talking
3620075 3621737 much lately.<br />- Oh.
3621743 3624656 Uh it's a nice camera.
3624663 3625663 Is that real film?
3627249 3629366 Oh, yeah, yeah.
3629376 3631993 Oh, you, you like photography.
3632003 3632834 (Kassi chuckles)
3632838 3634670 You were the one with all those, uh,
3634673 3636710 those crime scene photos
3636716 3639504 the day of the, the big fight, right?
3639511 3640511 Yeah.
3641805 3643888 Here, let me, let me take one of you.
3648770 3650386 Say cheese and crackers.
3653191 3654602 Cheese and crackers.
3654609 3659479 (chuckles) We have to wait<br />to see how it turns out.
3661825 3662825 You wanna blow on it?
3671001 3674244 (cell phone vibrates)
3674254 3676166 Hi, Dad, okay!
3676173 3677960 Okay, fine, I'm on my way.
3679134 3681126 Sorry, I'm late to meet my dad.
3681136 3684095 Oh, wow, just like that, huh?
3684097 3687090 Well, should I, should I<br />tell Tyler you came by?
3687100 3688466 Nah, forget it.
3690103 3693187 (door creaks)
3693190 3695648 (door clicks)
3723803 3725089 Dammit!
3725096 3728055 (screams violently)
3731061 3733769 (birds chirping)
3761132 3765001 (kid shouting in the distance)
3828491 3830949 [Pastor] So here we are<br />at this pivotal scene.
3830952 3833160 The son comes to his senses,
3833163 3835780 he's on the road to see his father.
3835790 3837747 And before he even gets to the door
3837751 3839617 the father sees him from a distance.
3840628 3844588 And scripture says the<br />father runs to seek him out.
3845884 3848752 You see, God always leaves<br />the door to redemption open
3850305 3853093 but it's up to us to pull<br />the handle and come on in.
3854059 3855971 So my question this morning is
3857687 3859053 are you gonna open the door?
3862025 3862856 (kids chattering)
3862859 3864976 - Hey, my, my turn.<br />- Now, you're gonna try it.
3864986 3867069 - I know.<br />- Yes.
3867072 3870065 That's what I said.<br />- Okay, that's very good.
3870075 3871907 [Cindy] Anyway, mom sends her love,
3871910 3875119 and, uh, she wants you to bring your tools
3875121 3878034 when you come up, 'cause<br />there's a bunch of little jobs
3878041 3879657 she has in mind for you.
3879667 3881829 Oh, someone wants to say hello to you.
3881836 3883828 [Susie] Hi, Daddy, I love you.
3883838 3885124 [Cindy] That's it, go ahead.
3885131 3887248 Okay, that's it, that's<br />all she wants to say.
3887258 3890968 I love you too, and, um, call us.
3890970 3892211 Okay, miss you.
3892222 3893212 Bye.
3893223 3895840 (watch beeping)

4018139 4021223 I'm wanted by the cops right<br />now for robbin' a bank.
4021226 4022717 You understand?

4033029 4034029 Oh.
4035782 4036782 Oh, my back.
4038159 4040947 I think I pulled somethin'<br />climbin' in here.
4042997 4045080 (sighing) It's okay.
4047877 4051166 All I did was rob a bank,<br />and, and no one got hurt,
4051172 4053129 but I need to get away.
4053132 4053997 I'm gonna take your car.
4054008 4055670 You got insurance, right?
4056928 4058669 I don't need money or anything.
4058680 4059761 Keys are in your purse?
4061808 4062808 That purse?
4065937 4066937 Oh, shit.
4086583 4087583 We're almost done.
4096509 4098967 (Don sighing)

4118489 4120151 I'm gonna give this to my friends

4136382 4138920 (Don groaning)
4146100 4148968 Come on, come on, come on, come on.

4205118 4207735 (woman sighing)
4212542 4215034 No, no, silly, not like that.
4217630 4218630 I'll do it.
4222552 4224885 You want something done,<br />you gotta do it yourself.
4224887 4226549 That's what my dad always told me.
4228182 4229514 But he was a real S-O-B.
4231144 4232144 Let me tell ya.
4234939 4236055 Put your hands, please.
4239527 4243271 I'll be out of here in two<br />shakes of a lamb's tail.
4243281 4245989 (woman grunting)
4247201 4248317 That's tight.
4248327 4251911 Oh, it's not too bad.<br />(woman sobbing)
4251914 4253496 Mm, Lucky likes your shampoo.
4257628 4260245 (woman gasping)
4263551 4266089 (Don groaning)
4267430 4270468 (lawnmower whirring)
4284489 4287277 (woman groaning)
4287283 4289400 (gasping)
4300671 4303288 (woman sobbing)
4331786 4334574 (woman screaming)
4361065 4365981 (woman grunting and gasping)<br />(plastic rustling)
4387425 4389758 (clicking)
4389760 4390760 Dad.
4394974 4396215 What are you doin' here?
4399729 4400810 Is she okay?
4403816 4404932 You should be gone.
4409947 4410947 Oh, Tyler.
4413576 4415533 You shouldn't see this.<br />- Dad!
4419624 4420740 What did I teach you?
4422543 4426913 You don't aim a weapon<br />unless you intend to use it.
4428174 4429894 (ominous music)<br />Are you gonna shoot me, bud?
4447360 4449352 You can't just leave<br />notes out for me like that.
4449362 4450853 My parents are gonna find them.
4453282 4454238 I like the black eye.
4454241 4455448 It's a good look for you.
4456786 4458573 You should've just taken<br />the pictures, though.
4458579 4459569 I thought you were gonna stop?
4459580 4462197 I am, come up.
4464043 4465500 This is Nora Devlin's house.
4465503 4467586 [Kassi] The only places I<br />know are Clovehitch places.
4467588 4468588 I'm sorry.
4472009 4473671 Look, I wanna hang out with you,
4474762 4477630 but it can't be about<br />this Clovehitch stuff,
4477640 4479131 especially not about my dad.
4482311 4484724 Okay, I get it.
4488985 4490351 But do you even believe me?
4492029 4493315 Do you really believe me?
4494865 4496572 I feel her sometimes.
4498077 4499077 What?
4501038 4502038 Let's go in.
4504333 4506541 - (sighing) No.<br />- Come on.
4506544 4507544 No!
4520975 4521975 Let's go!
4523602 4526140 (somber music)
4560681 4563139 He, um, came in through the basement.
4564935 4569179 And then tied her up<br />and tortured her here.
4571150 4572150 Then he killed her.
4574111 4575318 This is where they found the body.
4575321 4577688 Why are you doing this?
4577698 4579064 What did your dad tell you?
4583370 4584370 Tyler.
4592463 4593795 I'm not accusing your dad.
4595508 4597124 I just wanna know what happened.
4607770 4609102 It was Uncle Rudy.
4611649 4613015 [Kassi] In the wheelchair?
4616904 4618440 How long has he been like that?
4619949 4620949 10 years.
4623202 4624283 That's why he stopped.
4629333 4634294 He told me it was a car<br />accident but it was suicide.
4637466 4638547 Attempted suicide.
4644390 4646757 I found something in<br />the pit under your house.
4650479 4653267 Y-, you said there<br />was nothing under there.
4656110 4657567 There were rope fibers.
4658988 4660604 - Rope fibers?<br />- Yeah.
4661532 4663649 (sighing)
4665703 4667194 This isn't CSI.
4670457 4673165 Look, I know that you love<br />being obsessed with Clovehitch
4673169 4675627 because it makes you all<br />dark and interesting,
4675629 4679794 but, but really, this is my family.
4679800 4681132 He killed my mom.
4683095 4684095 What?
4686724 4689967 Clovehitch killed my mom.
4692897 4694354 I thought, um,
4694356 4695722 I thought your mom ran away.
4699820 4700820 Yeah.
4704158 4706946 When I was five, my dad came home
4706952 4708568 after a big fight with her.
4710539 4713077 And she was gone and so was her stuff.
4715294 4717206 And we never heard from her again.
4718339 4721173 My dad says that she abandoned us.
4724929 4726465 That's not what I remember.
4728349 4731933 I remember a man coming<br />in and making her cry.
4735814 4739683 And tying her up, and<br />putting me in the bathroom.
4742029 4743440 And her screams.
4747368 4750236 I turned on the water so<br />I didn't have to hear.
4753040 4756078 And it was years later that<br />I heard about Clovehitch
4758545 4759545 and I knew.
4763342 4765709 But my dad wouldn't listen,<br />no one would listen.
4765719 4770214 I didn't want it to be him,<br />so, no one's believed me.
4775437 4776769 What was her name?
4778899 4779899 Crystal.
4782611 4783611 Crystal Harper?
4789827 4794162 How do you know that?
4797751 4799208 Under the house,
4802089 4804547 there was a box, and it<br />had photos, and jewelry,
4807970 4809256 and driver's licenses.
4811598 4813089 There were 13 of them.
4820816 4821816 13?
4823986 4825022 Where are they?
4830826 4833534 It wasn't gonna bring 'em back.
4836040 4837156 And he's gone.
4840336 4842544 We had to protect our family.
4842546 4847541 - So where are they?<br />- So we burned them.
4847551 4848551 I'm sorry.
4851513 4853220 Do you believe him?
4855017 4857009 Is there any doubt in your mind?
4860481 4861481 Please.
4870741 4872698 Have a good time.
4872701 4874738 Thanks again, Dad, for<br />coming through with the money.
4874745 4877283 [Don] Eh, I figured you<br />learned all you can from me.
4877289 4878450 Have fun.<br />- I will.
4888425 4890963 (somber music)
4903065 4906308 [Kassi] Your dad was a handyman, right?
4906318 4907934 So?
4907945 4910733 Well, it'd explain why<br />there's no forced entry.
4910739 4912355 Case his victims' houses.
4914118 4915700 Uncle Rudy was a handyman too.
4932136 4933593 What are you expecting to see?
4935639 4936846 Anything.
4936849 4938215 There's no way he could be that sick
4938225 4939807 and not give any hint.
4939810 4941301 [Tyler] I've lived<br />with him my whole life.
4941311 4942311 There's no hint.
4943313 4945680 Maybe you don't know<br />what a normal dad is like.
4947776 4949608 No, yeah, no, I feel<br />like I'm learning a lot.
4949611 4952775 And the, the counselors<br />have been really helpful
4952781 4955524 and everything's been amazing so far.
4955534 4957571 Yeah, alright, alright.
4957578 4958578 I gotta go, Mom.
4959288 4960119 No, I love you too.
4960122 4961122 I'll talk to you later.
4962124 4964912 - He's following that woman.<br />- What woman?
4964918 4966750 [Kassi] The woman in the blue pants.
4968630 4969916 He's staring at her.
4982895 4985933 No, no, he'll see you, he'll see you.
4985939 4988056 (sighing)
4990068 4991104 This isn't gonna work.
4993530 4995192 What kind of phone does he have?

5105100 5106100 He left the house.
5108020 5109181 He's going to work.
5110272 5113265 We should wait for him to sneak<br />out at night or something.

5226888 5228220 He tied this here.
5228223 5229223 I saw him.
5230142 5232680 (somber music)
5253582 5254582 Tyler.
5256126 5257126 Tyler.
5275854 5278392 It's the woman from the market.
5319064 5320064 I'll go in with you.
5322150 5323150 No, no.
5324319 5326231 I need to talk to him alone.
5331618 5334156 (somber music)

5558470 5559551 Is she okay?
5560889 5562175 [Don] You should be gone.
5563224 5564224 (sighing) Oh, Tyler.
5565643 5567305 You shouldn't see this.<br />- Dad!
5569355 5570766 [Don] What did I teach you?
5572275 5576645 You don't aim a weapon<br />unless you intend to use it.
5578156 5579522 Are you gonna shoot me, bud?
5585455 5586946 You have to turn yourself in.
5590210 5591417 Kassi?<br />- Yeah.
5592420 5593420 Go and help her.
5602305 5603841 She's manipulating you.
5609104 5610104 Bud.
5612023 5613023 Bud, listen to me.
5614776 5616312 I'd never hurt anyone.
5618404 5621863 This, this woman and I<br />are having an affair.
5623535 5625151 We're a little kinky, that's all.
5626454 5629743 I know, I know, this is<br />a lot for you to take in
5630792 5632374 but your mother knows all about this.
5632377 5633208 She and I...
5633211 5634668 Are you serious with this bullshit?
5634671 5636503 Bud, if this gets<br />out, all you're gonna do
5636506 5637917 is hurt your mom and Susie.
5638883 5640749 I need you to lower your aim.
5640760 5642376 Accidents happen.
5647976 5650013 It's okay, bud, it's okay.
5650019 5651885 She was gonna hurt somebody.
5651896 5655310 You and me, we know about gun safety.
5655316 5659902 Now, I trust you to properly<br />handle a firearm, but not her.
5667412 5668948 I need you to lower your weapon.
5671541 5675285 Let's not become another bad<br />statistic about gun safety.
5677547 5678663 Accidents happen.
5685805 5686805 Good man.
5689058 5690674 I'm very proud of you, bud.
5693146 5694146 Very proud.
5696357 5697723 You're doin' the right thing.
5699319 5701732 (breathes heavily)
5701738 5702738 Remember,
5705617 5706983 butt first.
5709913 5713497 You used to think that was so funny.
5715793 5716793 Butt first?
5722258 5723258 There you go.
5725553 5728011 (Don sighing)
5729515 5730515 I'm not mad.
5735897 5737354 Just disappointed.
5741069 5743436 (gun clicks)
5746407 5748820 (Tyler gasps)
5749994 5752611 (both grunting)
5760546 5764165 (Tyler choking and gasping)
5778481 5782191 (Tyler gasping and coughing)
5789742 5792860 (Kassi breathing heavily)
5792870 5795487 (Tyler panting)
5816436 5818974 (somber music)
5848760 5851298 Tyler, hurry up, please,<br />I can't be late again.
5853222 5854222 Okay.
5855391 5856632 I want pancakes.
5858936 5862475 Well, you're in luck,<br />because oatmeal is pancakes
5862482 5864223 that Big Bird chewed up.
5864233 5866941 - Gross.<br />- Sweetie, please?
5868237 5870980 I need you to be a good<br />little bug for me today, okay?
5870990 5872026 (sighing) Okay, mom.
5873242 5875108 - Thank you.<br />- You're welcome.
5877622 5879158 Tyler!
5879165 5880201 I'm coming!
5889967 5891083 - Amen.<br />- Amen.
5897600 5900058 There's an opening at<br />Billy's uncle's shop.
5900061 5902269 I could pick up a few<br />shifts there next week.
5903898 5906857 (telephone ringing)
5909112 5910112 [Cindy] Hello?
5911656 5912656 Yes, speaking.
5913574 5916191 (somber music)
5933886 5936003 [Randy] I'm sorry.
5936013 5940974 I'm so sorry.
5942854 5945722 (muffled chatting)
5967837 5969669 [Tyler] So what should we do now?
5972175 5973175 [Kassi] Nothing.
5973968 5976005 Police won't connect it to Clovehitch.
5977472 5979384 She never saw his face.
5982393 5983393 Yeah.
5990818 5992559 This is what you wanted.
5999452 6002820 Mommy, I don't wanna go to bed, please!
6004248 6007286 Please, I want someone to sleep with me.
6007293 6008500 I don't want...
6019972 6020972 - Hey.<br />- Hey.
6026979 6029141 - Can I sit down?<br />- Yeah, sure.
6038574 6041032 The police wanted to talk to you.
6045623 6046623 I told them no.
6048793 6049793 They...
6054298 6056039 They don't think it was an accident.
6060763 6062425 Do you understand what I'm saying?
6069188 6070188 They think s-...
6073067 6074649 They think somebody killed him?
6076946 6079529 Oh, goodness no, Tyler, no.
6080992 6081992 No, they...
6083744 6085781 They think that someone
6087248 6090161 as experienced as Don wouldn't just...
6093838 6095124 Yes, he had his problems
6095131 6100047 but we dealt with them together.
6100970 6102256 (sobbing) I told them that.
6105182 6106514 Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
6106517 6109681 It's okay, it's okay,<br />it's okay, it's okay.
6109687 6110643 (Cindy sobbing)
6110646 6111646 It's okay.
6116527 6119895 (somber music)<br />It's okay.
6123200 6125817 Color guard, post the flag of Troop 22.
6128664 6131873 Color guard, post the flag of<br />the United States of America.
6134837 6135953 Color guard, dismissed.
6142428 6146388 And now, Mrs. Burnside,<br />please present the sash.
6161739 6163731 I present to you, the newest inductee
6163741 6166575 into the Order of Light, Tyler Burnside.
6166577 6168944 (applauding)
6180883 6181883 Thank you.
6183469 6186507 Normally, the troop leader<br />would say a few words.
6186514 6189302 So, instead, I'd like to<br />say a few words about him.
6191227 6193059 Donald Burnside, my father.
6195106 6197018 We all saw different sides of him.
6198734 6201898 To our community, he was a leader.
6203072 6205109 To our family, he was a provider.
6207076 6208317 To me, he was a dad.
6212748 6215115 As troop leader, my<br />father helped many of us
6215126 6216833 get our gun safety badges
6218170 6221789 which makes his accident<br />that much more tragic.
6227346 6231716 The truth is bad things<br />happen to good people.
6235020 6236761 Our only defense is to come together
6238357 6239357 like we've done tonight.
6246115 6248653 (somber music)
6255499 6259618 That's what my dad taught<br />me through how he lived.
6265384 6269253 Let's remember that, how<br />he impacted our lives.
6304465 6307003 (gun clicking)
6310805 6312842 Dad, if you can hear me...
6313849 6316808 (crickets chirping)
6349134 6350134 I love you.
6357351 6360219 (melancholy music)
