1502 4870 <i>MAN:</i> On this track, you will hear<br />director John McTiernan
5047 8915 and production designer<br />Jackson DeGovia. John McTiernan:
9092 14178 My principle concern going into this was that<br />it was a story that concerned terrorists,
14348 20515 and terrorist movies are usually mean and<br />filled with all sorts of mean and nasty acts.
20687 26683 I didn't say yes to this project until we figured<br />out ways to put, in essence, some joy in it.
26860 31775 As we go through it, you'll see the number<br />of decisions that show up over and over again
31949 38366 were all on that basic theme: how do we<br />take the meanness out of a terrorist story
38539 43705 and turn it into something that is<br />essentially summer entertainment?
45337 46623 <i>MAN:</i> Jackson DeGovia:
46797 49915 I don't think I was the first choice.
50092 55963 There were six weeks to go and they paid me<br />more money than I'd ever made. It was great.
56139 61555 At that time we didn't know whether we<br />were going to go to Texas for the building.
61728 64390 I said, "There's a building<br />right here on the lot."
64565 69901 "If we get a chance at it, let's get it. We own<br />it. Cut to the chase. We got six weeks to go."
70070 75031 It turned out to be eight weeks, but that's<br />just ridiculous, a project of this magnitude.
75701 78409 So, things fell out that way.
78579 82948 Apparently it was a real tough negotiation,<br />but I think <i>Die Hard</i> made that building.
83125 87619 The Fox Plaza will forever be<br />the <i>Die Hard</i> building.
89339 94300 <i>JOHN:</i> This was actually pretty early.<br />It was right at the start.
94469 97803 We actually did shoot it at the airport.
97973 101887 And I had them tow the airplane<br />around in circles for a little while.
107024 112394 <i>JACKSON:</i> That's the Joel Silver element. Joel<br />Silver insisted that there be female eye candy,
112571 116360 which was good because<br />it's part of the glamour of the picture.
116575 119988 There's a lot of eye<br />candy for females too.
120162 126408 The way Willis is dressed, and the dancer -<br />I forget his name - oh, he's just beautiful.
126585 130249 Something people don't take into account<br />is that it was a Christmas movie.
130422 133915 It was some idea that,<br />in the original draft of the script,
134092 140589 he would walk by a line of palm trees with<br />Christmas lights on them, which we didn't do
140932 142472 Thank God.
142643 145977 This is interesting.<br />Takagi is standing right now
146146 151061 in an exact reproduction of<br />Frank Lloyd Wright's Falling Water.
151234 155728 In this period, the Japanese corporations<br />were buying America.
155906 160446 We posited that in the 34th floor atrium<br />of this corporation,
160619 163737 the Nakatomi Corporation<br />had bought Falling Water,
163914 168875 disassembled it and reassembled it in the<br />atrium of their building, like a trophy.
169044 171838 <i>JOHN:</i> This whole early section<br />is really about geography.
171922 178919 It's really just slowly letting the audience<br />see how things are connected, where things are,
179096 183431 because later on it will be important -<br />like where that elevator is.
184601 187184 We follow Holly here to her office.
188397 191139 These are really all geographic setups.
192192 194861 <i>JACKSON:</i> Joel Silver<br />is nuts about Frank Lloyd Wright,
194945 200440 so we thought it would be nice<br />if we did a kind of Wrightian interior,
200617 204781 so all the design details<br />are very Wrightian.
205288 211250 The stone, which is now called <i>Die Hard</i><br />stone in the inventory of the Fox staff shop,
211420 215084 is actually a Frank Lloyd Wright<br />fieldstone design.
221388 227680 The famous backing, 380 feet long, painted<br />backing by the strings at Warner Brothers.
227853 230845 Those animated night-lights and things.
231022 236984 <i>JOHN:</i> Our main problem in this scene was<br />hiding that painted background of the city.
237320 241568 <i>JACKSON:</i> I hated this house.<br />I just didn't think it was special enough.
242409 245322 It was kind of picked because of
245495 249832 the shot of the car driving up to the house<br />with the <i>Die Hard</i> building in the background.
249916 254786 McTiernan and I got in his gray-market<br />Mercedes and drove around LA
254963 259924 to find a place where we could get that<br />entrance, and this house was convenient.
260093 263131 That's a light behind the backing there,<br />that sunset.
263305 266218 Jan de Bont did that.
266641 269474 But the strings told us<br />that it could be done.
269644 272227 He was surprised and<br />he did a great job with it.
272397 275310 <i>JOHN:</i> We didn't storyboard any of this<br />stuff.
275484 279899 Basically, I storyboarded effects shots,<br />where you have to discuss it with people,
280071 285783 but I think I gave up storyboarding regular<br />sequences before I got to this movie.
285952 290446 Storyboards give you a fixed idea of how<br />things will look. They never look that way,
290624 294834 and you tend to not see what's<br />in front of your face sometimes
295003 298871 because you're so certain<br />it looks like the storyboard.
299049 304886 Another difficulty with it is that very<br />few artists understand how lenses work
305055 308844 just the simple aspect of<br />a wide angle lens or a long lens.
309100 311250 The incident that sold me on this project
311436 313312 I'd turned the script<br />down a couple of times,
313396 318141 but the incident that sold me on it was<br />a little thing we made up, coming up here.
318318 320418 He says it's his first day driving a limo.
320570 324655 The guy responds, "Don't worry.<br />It's my first time riding in one."
324825 327362 That was sort of the<br />essential American thing:
327536 331370 to refuse to ride in the back of a car<br />with someone else driving.
331540 335249 You sit next to them, out of simple<br />respect, and this guy would do that.
335418 338160 I thought it was a nice way to say<br />he was a decent guy.
338338 342467 <i>JACKSON:</i> This is interesting, the symbol of<br />the Nakatomi Corporation. I designed this.
342551 347091 The first version, Joel didn't like<br />because it was Swastika-like.
347264 350256 There was something ominous about it.
350433 357433 It's an abstraction of a Samurai helmet -<br />the Nakatomi Corporation is a warrior.
357941 362560 Also ominous - bad things<br />are gonna happen where this is.
377502 379584 This guy was great, Argyle.
380589 384048 He's basically a plot device,<br />but he made the most of it.
384217 387676 He doesn't do anything in the picture<br />except sit there.
387846 391680 He's like the chorus in <i>Henry V:</i><br />he starts things going.
391850 396219 He's the person that talks, and...<br />Hey, there it is: my card.
396396 399229 Maybe that's why I like him -<br />he's behind my card.
399399 402562 Then he sits in that<br />garage, gets locked in
402736 406821 and ends up knocking over<br />the ambulance at the back.
406990 410699 You've got to understand,<br />we didn't start out that way.
410869 412860 At the point we filmed this,
413038 415790 we didn't know what<br />the ending of the picture was gonna be.
415874 418286 We didn't know how it was gonna resolve.
418460 421087 A little later, when the truck<br />pulls up to the loading dock,
421171 425005 you'll see that it's impossible that<br />that ambulance could have been inside.
425175 429260 Cos we didn't know it was gonna be inside<br />at the time. But you don't notice.
429429 432929 Argyle ends up being the guy<br />who resolves it all, which is really nice.
433016 439388 I think unconsciously he was, like...<br />He's the frame of the action.
439731 442063 He just sits there and waits.
459793 465914 <i>JOHN:</i> I hadn't read the book. I read the early<br />scripts, and they're the ones I turned down.
466091 468082 But the two principle changes I made
468259 470091 were in essence that little thing,
470428 472465 That nature of the character.
472639 478851 That he's a basic American guy instead of<br />being a strong-jawed, latter-day Dirty Harry.
479020 484641 <i>JACKSON:</i> Looks like a Nakatomi up at the top and<br />at the side. It's the only view you get of it.
484818 488607 I wanted Alan Rickman to be speared<br />on it... <i>[LAUGHS]</i> when he landed.
489406 491574 Production designers<br />are always over the top.
491658 496869 These were supposed to be gigantic<br />bonsais. We put those in in the Plaza.
497038 499621 Can you have a giant bonsai? Probably not.
499791 502877 <i>JOHN:</i> The second thing was...<br />I may be getting ahead of the story,
502961 506261 but just, in essence, turning<br />the terrorist story into a robbery...
507298 509084 People can have fun with a robbery.
509259 513344 A terrorist story is, by definition,<br />dark and unhappy.
513513 517928 But with a good caper, you know,<br />you can appreciate the bad guys too,
518101 523596 and that allows us to put essentially<br />some joy in the bad guys' activity.
525025 528893 Which, you know, is the sort of thing<br />you don't discuss with studio executives
529070 533064 because they'll think<br />you're untrustworthy.
533241 538827 But putting some joy in this story<br />was my principle concern, going into it.
538997 544117 Finding ways you could get some humor that<br />wasn't forced, but at least lightness.
544294 548583 And finding ways in which you could<br />simply enjoy what was going on,
548757 553376 rather than having the bad guys<br />do very bad things that make you hate them
553553 556887 and then you get even and<br />do bad things to them in return.
557057 559389 It's not a joyful experience.
561811 565645 <i>JACKSON:</i> The security counter here,<br />which we built in,
565815 568728 has got a feature that appears later<br />in the museum,
568902 571234 in the offices where Takagi gets killed.
571404 576740 They're battered walls<br />taken from 16th-century Japanese forts.
577702 582697 This was very advanced for its time,<br />this little touchscreen thing.
582874 587289 The Nakatomis came from<br />Japanese clan symbols.
587462 591672 In Kurosawa, those things that<br />the Samurai warriors have on their flags
591841 597052 that are really strong graphics -<br />that's what we were trying to do.
598681 600797 Oh, man.
602310 604927 We struggled so hard with graphics.
608066 612481 It's really hard to make computer graphics<br />do everything they're supposed to do.
612654 615612 Great shot.<br />Those gates, of course, we put in.
619077 622069 Some wonderful sculptures by Laddie Dillat
622247 625247 that Joel Silver found,<br />at the end of the elevator corridors.
625416 629501 I don't think we see them much.<br />There's one - that one, there.
630922 634290 <i>JOHN:</i> I think this was<br />Jan's first American movie.
634467 641089 I saw Paul Verhoeven's <i>The Fourth Man</i><br />shortly before this
641266 644804 and loved the camera moves in it<br />and looked him up.
644978 647595 Now, either just before<br />that or just after that,
647772 653518 Paul started making movies in the US, and he<br />got Jan for his first three or four films.
654279 657112 <i>JACKSON:</i> OK, so now he's on the set.
657282 662322 It's a huge set. On Stage 14, I think -<br />one of the big stages at Fox.
662912 664747 The architecture is a combination of...
664831 669496 Ando, the great Japanese architect -<br />he does those concrete slabs...
669669 672206 That's the rock from Falling Water.
673756 679468 <i>JOHN:</i> It's funny, Jan is very Dutch<br />and very opinionated and very certain,
679637 685508 and we used to scrap like cats and dogs,<br />and we terrorized the crew
685685 690304 they'd think that the set<br />was going to blow up at any instant.
690481 694816 But there was always a thing between Jan<br />and I - somehow we respected each other,
694986 698900 and it was always within<br />the context of the work.
699073 702111 So we could have a fight,<br />we could have a spat,
702285 707451 and neither of us took it personally<br />or emotionally personally.
707624 709991 We kept riding home together every night,
710168 712785 no matter what sort of<br />fight we had on the set,
712962 717331 and the crew couldn't<br />understand that. <i>[LAUGHS]</i>
725391 729931 <i>JACKSON:</i> Three colors of stone...<br />God, we labored over that stuff.
730104 733392 <i>JOHN:</i> It was important<br />to set up this character
733566 737685 because he is<br />the one victim in the story, really.
742242 746611 <i>[LAUGHS]</i> I can't claim any credit for<br />Hart.
746788 749450 Hart came in with this... He's hysterical.
749624 755040 I mean, he just so had this character<br />and the drugs and the whole business down.
755213 761255 He's fabulous, and he kept breaking us up<br />every time we got on... we had him in to work.
761427 768140 And I think he had so much fun with it<br />because he'd always played the straight guy.
768309 774021 He was getting a chance to make fun of<br />all sorts of people he'd had to work for.
776359 780569 Man, I'd forgotten how great<br />that backing looks. Jesus.
780738 786074 <i>JACKSON:</i> Nice twilight. They're back-lighting<br />the mountains there and the sky.
786244 791990 So this is like a translight, even though it's<br />a painted backing. That's a gorgeous backing.
792166 797081 It still exists, I think, in pieces in<br />Fox's inventory. They use it all the time.
799716 804085 This was on a platform seven feet high,<br />so you can see down into the backing.
805555 808593 Nice. We built the outside of the building<br />on the set also
808766 811849 so you can see it out<br />the windows like that.
812979 815562 <i>JOHN:</i> We didn't rehearse.
817108 819349 What I would usually try to do is
819527 823566 start shooting somewhere near<br />the beginning of the story
823740 826903 and let the actors figure out<br />what they're doing from there.
827076 834076 Certainly, I would never ask actors<br />as experienced as those two
834417 836658 to go rehearse.
837628 842293 <i>JACKSON:</i> This guy is so great. All<br />the minor parts were so beautifully cast.
842633 844426 OK, there's an in-joke here.
844510 849380 This is the truck with the raiders in it,<br />which is...
851934 854141 Pacific Courier,
854354 857563 which means "messenger of peace".<br />I used the same
857899 861441 Name and graphic in<br /><i>Speed</i> and in <i>Die Hard 3.</i>
861611 864945 The truck that gets blown up<br />at the beginning of <i>Die Hard 3</i>
865114 868948 is also a green truck<br />called Pacific Courier.
869118 874284 I love that. I don't think I ever told<br />anybody - production designer irony.
875583 879372 <i>JOHN:</i> To the extent I could,<br />I started at the beginning.
879545 884381 I tried to get these scenes in first<br />before we had to do anything more serious,
884550 888043 so that the actors got the chance<br />to figure out who they were gonna be
888221 891054 and how they related to each other.
891224 892885 <i>JACKSON:</i> Love her.
893059 895972 I don't know who<br />came up with the wallpapers.
896771 901481 I think we did. It was really bold<br />at this time to go for foils like this
901651 904894 you know, things that are<br />really highly reflective.
905071 910441 You know, the combination of<br />strong, decorative elements
910618 917206 with, you know, the traditional feeling<br />of Wrightian architecture and Ando.
917375 918911 And putting all this together.
919085 924296 There's a real old-world/new-world/the<br />East triangle going on.
924465 928424 This is very Japanese-looking.<br />And you'll see...
928594 933634 We did a Japanese interior in the executive<br />offices upstairs where Takagi gets killed.
933808 939895 So we tried to, you know, realize all the<br />elements, you know, in the architecture.
941399 946485 It's got to work out of focus too because<br />that's mostly when you're going to see it.
946696 951065 I love this. Look at the gold<br />and silver foil - it's just great.
954704 960199 <i>JOHN:</i> There was one scene with Bonnie later<br />on where she surprised the hell out of me.
960376 966122 I was quietly humiliated because it was an<br />interpretation of it that I hadn't thought of
966299 971669 and she was so absolutely right,<br />and I just went, "Oh, I'm sorry."
972472 975134 Then I shot it her way, cos I don't know,
975308 979358 I felt like a complete fool - I hadn't<br />realized she could read the line that well.
981230 986691 But that's the sort of people...<br />She and Bruce are real pros about acting
986861 989819 and you don't have to<br />do their work for them.
991240 996656 Bonnie was Bruce's suggestion. He saw her in<br /><i>Heart Like a Wheel,</i> or something like that,
996829 998411 playing a race-car driver.
998581 1004418 He'd wanted to work with her for quite<br />a while - it was a fabulous suggestion.
1004587 1008125 Right there is the first step...
1008508 1011546 We discovered what the essence<br />of his character was
1011719 1013335 about halfway through the movie.
1013513 1017713 It wasn't in the script at all. In the<br />script, he was just a heavy-duty New York cop.
1018893 1023603 We figured out that<br />the essence of his character was
1023773 1028017 he didn't really like himself very much<br />and he was doing the best he could.
1028194 1031562 <i>JACKSON:</i> Oh, great shot -<br />that's pure McTiernan. Look at that.
1031739 1034106 Best director I ever worked for.
1035451 1038489 <i>JOHN:</i> It shows up all the way<br />through the story later on
1038663 1042452 there's the confessional in the bathroom<br />with the glass and stuff.
1042625 1045127 But I think we went back<br />and shot that little business
1045211 1049455 where he banged his head and said,<br />"Very good, John. Good move."
1050925 1053385 <i>JACKSON:</i> You know,<br />he's not only a terrific director,
1053469 1056382 he's one of the most intelligent people<br />I've ever known.
1056556 1060094 The only difficulty I have working<br />with him is that he thinks so fast.
1060268 1063306 He's got such an incredible structure<br />already in his mind
1063479 1068940 that he sometimes forgets that everybody<br />else is about two chapters behind him.
1069986 1076449 He assumes that we know the logical<br />conclusion of things that he's just set up.
1078578 1081320 <i>JOHN:</i> Now, hear this little<br />piece of music starting?
1081497 1084706 Remember what I said earlier<br />about, in essence,
1084875 1089164 what I was trying to introduce<br />was a sense of joy?
1089755 1094215 And I had this piece of music in my head<br />for a long time
1094385 1098720 and started saying,<br />"We've gotta play this thing that's in..."
1098889 1101892 I remember it from <i>A Clockwork Orange</i><br />and it was in the 9th Symphony.
1101976 1106812 But it was a couple of months later that I<br />learned the title of the damn piece of music
1106981 1109348 is "The Ode to Joy".
1109525 1114019 It was so dead on.<br />It was the expression of these guys.
1115448 1117485 Michael Kamen was the composer.
1117658 1122448 He did a great job of feathering<br />it through as a thematic idea.
1122622 1124722 <i>JACKSON:</i> So many great details. Now,<br />look.
1124832 1127620 Can there be an ambulance in there?
1128169 1130752 <i>[LAUGHS]</i> Just maybe.
1133549 1137668 This is actually on an upper floor<br />when they turn that corner.
1139013 1143257 <i>JOHN:</i> You see, he's humming it here -<br />he's humming the Beethoven.
1143434 1147519 But Michael feathered it right through<br />the rest of the score
1147688 1153058 and set it up so we'd play it full on<br />at the climax later on.
1153235 1155567 <i>JACKSON:</i><br />We really sweated over that graphic.
1155738 1159572 I think that's a real successful one -<br />the locking of the elevators.
1159742 1163326 And I use those yellow and black stripes<br />all the time.
1164455 1169370 I used them on <i>Speed</i> - I painted whole vehicles<br />at the airport - because it's so strong.
1169543 1172706 It just says it immediately.
1177510 1181925 <i>JOHN:</i> German terrorists are neutral.<br />They weren't Middle Eastern terrorists.
1182098 1186467 They weren't connected with anything<br />that made any sense or was sensitive.
1186644 1189932 And I know that was part of<br />what we were concerned with:
1190106 1194350 "Let's not gratuitously<br />step on people's toes."
1194527 1200273 "Let's not get involved in politics because it's<br />supposed to be entertainment, not politics."
1201325 1206491 <i>JACKSON:</i> A production designer is overall<br />and, uh... creative relations.
1206872 1209159 And the art director<br />is like an exec officer.
1209333 1212961 The way I organize an art department,<br />they have some design responsibility,
1213045 1218006 but basically they're there to see<br />that it gets done and that it's right.
1219510 1224220 The supervising art director,<br />as we would call it now, was John Jensen.
1225266 1230352 And I would have to look at the material<br />to see who the designers were.
1230521 1232512 They were, of course, very good.
1232690 1239690 John was my long-time art director,<br />and he's just absolutely fantastic.
1240698 1244908 I'll have to get back to you on the<br />construction coordinator. He was terrific.
1245077 1246909 Bruce Gfeller, right.
1247079 1250447 Our schedule was impossible.
1250624 1257246 We were running three shifts on this big<br />set - 24 hours a day, seven days a week
1257423 1259664 to get it done, because<br />we started so late.
1260342 1264553 I'm really concerned with how it looks<br />and what's shootable and doable.
1264722 1267680 It's my experience that's supposed<br />to make this possible,
1267850 1271468 and I'm supposed to be the keeper<br />of the through-line and the design
1271645 1274307 like the author, as it<br />were, of the design.
1275900 1282900 And, you know, I relate with, like, Jan de<br />Bont and John McTiernan and Joel Silver
1283157 1289654 because they all have input into the design -<br />they all have requirements and, uh, strength.
1289830 1293664 And the set decorator<br />does the interior decor.
1295628 1298666 <i>JOHN:</i> It's nice seeing this<br />with a full anamorphic screen.
1298839 1302958 Most of the time when you see it on<br />television, it has the edges all cropped off
1303135 1306969 so that you lose<br />an awful lot of the geography.
1307139 1309975 That's the great thing about the DVDs:<br />you can now go back
1310059 1314895 and actually see the movie, instead<br />of the lopped-off videotape version.
1319318 1323937 I was particularly concerned<br />with the sense of camera movement.
1324114 1327277 Technically, I suppose,<br />it was my preoccupation at that time.
1327451 1333572 I'd done a lot of it in <i>Predator,</i><br />and I wanted to do a lot more here,
1333874 1337833 so that was particularly<br />why I hired Jan de Bont
1338003 1342497 because of his style of camera movement<br />in <i>The Fourth Man.</i>
1347429 1353015 Frank Urioste, who<br />had cut, um... <i>RoboCop</i>,
1353894 1355976 and that was Paul Verhoeven...
1356146 1361107 That must have been his first American<br />movie, and that had a lot of movement in it.
1361485 1363779 What I was trying to<br />do was get an editor...
1363863 1366446 There used to be an awful lot of nostrams
1366615 1369198 about what you could do<br />and what you couldn't do.
1369368 1373862 And, particularly for a young filmmaker,<br />you'd have...
1374039 1377373 If the editor didn't agree,<br />he'd start bad-mouthing you
1377543 1381662 to the studio behind your back:<br />"This stuff doesn't cut very well cos..."
1381839 1388506 There used to be rules that you can't<br />cut a shot until the camera stops moving.
1388679 1393173 I'd cut an awful lot of my own stuff, and I<br />was happy cutting when the camera was moving.
1393350 1397309 It takes a particular<br />style, but it can be done.
1397479 1403145 And that's what I was particularly concerned<br />about - about getting Frank Urioste.
1403319 1407529 He was wonderfully supportive<br />about cutting on movement and
1408490 1410481 we, between the two of us,
1410659 1414869 sort of set up a research program of:<br />"What can we do and what can't we do?"
1415039 1419658 For quite a while I was shooting<br />alternate takes of most shots.
1419835 1423203 I would shoot the move<br />at a different speed
1423380 1428045 so that Frank could cut so that<br />he could match the movement speed.
1428218 1430880 Gradually we found it<br />wasn't that necessary.
1431055 1435970 My own sense of timing got better or<br />something, and we had to do less of it.
1436143 1441058 But I think through the first half of this<br />movie I was shooting alternate speeds.
1458916 1460702 <i>JACKSON:</i> I love this set.
1460876 1463493 This was an actual floor<br />under construction,
1463671 1469838 and we just took the materials that<br />they would have used and made this jungle.
1470678 1474842 My first insight when I read the script,<br />and on meeting John McTiernan,
1475015 1478758 I said this was a jungle picture -<br />he is in the jungle.
1478936 1481803 It's like <i>The Naked Prey,</i> you know.
1485484 1490445 <i>JOHN:</i> You'd never see that move<br />right there in an American movie.
1493200 1497201 A simple, expressive or subjective move<br />like that.
1497997 1501035 It was only in European<br />films at that point.
1501208 1504576 Paul was the only one<br />who was working at that time...
1504837 1506937 Fellini had moved the camera tremendously.
1507047 1510790 There were other Europeans that,<br />obviously, I'd studied.
1510968 1515337 <i>JACKSON:</i> Man, I'm really getting off on the<br />backing, seeing this again. I had no idea.
1515514 1521385 A production designer always feels that<br />you're not looking at the sets enough.
1521562 1525315 That's our take on things. We always try<br />to be wider, you know, "Look this way."
1525399 1531691 And Jan, of course, is a brilliant visual<br />composer, and he really did me proud
1531864 1536074 he showed it to me in interesting ways<br />that I never would have thought of.
1536243 1540202 He has this wonderful,<br />impish Dutchness about him.
1540372 1542613 He's a naughty boy.
1544126 1547369 <i>JOHN:</i> I wrote this line<br />and I'm still proud of it.
1547546 1550163 I put in the thing about Manzanar.
1553427 1559799 I created a little thing where we would do his<br />bio and find out, "Jeez, this is a decent guy
1559975 1566392 from a middle-class background, who clearly<br />got there because of hard work and brains."
1566565 1569978 "He doesn't need to be...<br />He doesn't deserve this treatment."
1571320 1573106 <i>JACKSON:</i> Oh, is he terrific.
1573280 1575271 Total sociopath.
1575449 1581195 And also I think it was McTiernan's idea that<br />the heavies would all be like male models,
1581371 1585660 European male models,<br />which was a wonderful new idea.
1585834 1591295 They've got this kind of decadent, but<br />very expensive, sleaziness about them
1591465 1594332 even their sweat clothes are designer.
1595844 1598882 <i>JOHN:</i> Part of it also was setting up<br />that act of courage
1599056 1603641 where he stands up and says,<br />"Don't blame somebody else, I'm him."
1603811 1605973 Which is right out of <i>Spartacus</i>
1606146 1609696 the end of <i>Spartacus,</i> where they all<br />stand up and say, "I am Spartacus."
1609858 1612604 That's him saying it.
1612778 1615861 Here he is. He's humming Beethoven.
1620119 1623487 Jackie, the casting director, found Alan.
1623664 1628625 He was in <i>Liaisons Dangereuses</i> in...
1628794 1632162 I think in London, not<br />New York - in the play.
1634258 1636795 He was delightful to work with.
1636969 1643090 He had so many colors and could try<br />so many things. He was completely unjaded.
1643267 1647807 I think this was his first film,<br />or certainly his first American movie.
1658574 1664069 I confess that's another one of my<br />little additions - the Alexander business.
1664246 1667455 I was just trying to set up<br />that he was a bit pretentious,
1667624 1671788 and was concerned that people<br />know he was an educated man.
1673046 1676132 <i>JACKSON:</i> This, I think,<br />was from the architect of the building.
1676216 1678583 Joel Silver got a Frank<br />Lloyd Wright model
1678760 1682719 it's the bridge that he was going to build<br />over San Francisco Bay.
1682890 1687475 There's the Lloyd Wright bridge there.<br />That actually came from his estate.
1688395 1690477 We had to clean it up a bit.
1690647 1693316 This was going to go over<br />the south end of San Francisco Bay.
1693400 1695516 It's a pity it was never built.
1695694 1698903 <i>JOHN:</i> What he's playing here right now is
1699072 1705193 he wants to convince Takagi that he is<br />qualified to be a corporate executive.
1705370 1708237 He's sort of imitating<br />his style, in a way.
1709249 1711960 <i>JACKSON:</i> We're seeing<br />the battered walls from the fort.
1712044 1715753 This is all like 15th century Japanese -<br />those walls there.
1715923 1718039 De Bont did a wonderful thing
1718217 1723553 he laid fluorescent tubes at the bottom<br />just behind black to highlight the stone.
1725432 1729426 Outside the windows here<br />are those life-size clay figures from...
1729770 1731855 See them in the background there?
1731939 1735933 ...from the tomb that was<br />just discovered in China.
1736109 1739898 Remember that whole army of individuals?<br />We made a couple of those.
1740072 1745158 This goddamn computer screen<br />that folds up was an endless hassle.
1745327 1747785 I'm very proud of the design<br />of this board table,
1747955 1751073 because it was designed,<br />not only to be Japanese
1751250 1754493 and to have what we now know as feng shui,
1754670 1758584 but to be a great place for the action<br />that takes place later:
1758757 1760794 the chase above and below the table.
1760968 1764757 It was basically something<br />that worked on the back of an envelope
1764930 1769424 and then just got done as soon as<br />it could get done, like everything else.
1769601 1772687 <i>JOHN:</i> A lot of people have commented,<br />and they're completely right,
1772771 1774853 the plot in this is ludicrous.
1775023 1779438 Terrorists pretending to be terrorists<br />so they can be robbers is ridiculous.
1779611 1783611 But it allowed me to get to the essential<br />thing that I was talking about earlier:
1783699 1788444 that we can enjoy an intention<br />on the part of the bad guys
1788620 1791328 to cleverly snatch a whole pile of money.
1791498 1794581 You can't enjoy it if right at this point
1794751 1798460 he was trying to get the money<br />because of some political thing.
1798630 1801713 The sense of joy would go<br />out of the movie at that instant,
1801883 1808095 and it doesn't matter how many times they<br />hum the "Ode to Joy", the joy would be gone.
1808265 1812259 <i>JACKSON:</i> That's kind of a cheap, plastic<br />lay-on there that worked really well.
1812436 1815428 Cutting the keyholes in there was good.
1816106 1821226 <i>JOHN:</i> We're coming up here to the one<br />serious moment of violence in the movie.
1821403 1825303 Because most of the others are meant<br />to be a little bit over the top and goofy,
1825407 1829401 and this one was the one<br />that was supposed to be shocking.
1829578 1831829 And it functioned that way<br />with the ratings board.
1831913 1835702 We had to negotiate<br />forever, frame by frame,
1835876 1839790 about how much red paint<br />we could leave on the door.
1841757 1844920 It's such a shock when<br />this guy gets killed.
1847637 1850220 I don't know if I ever got it clear...
1850390 1855135 Did I make it clear that those two guys are<br />making a bet on whether or not he gets shot?
1855312 1857981 <i>JACKSON:</i> One thing that's great<br />about the movie is that all these people
1858065 1860181 in all these stories are really vivid.
1860359 1864648 And in order to get people to care about<br />the world, you gotta blow up a building.
1864821 1870737 In that snide review in <i>Salon...</i> "What's<br />so hard about blowing up a building?"
1870911 1873243 It's about blowing up<br />a building that matters.
1873413 1878624 It's like deconstructing the proudest<br />accomplishment of our corporate civilization
1878794 1882583 in order to get down to the level where<br />you can care about the mechanicals,
1882756 1885168 in the sense of Shakespeare's mechanicals.
1885342 1891463 And that's one of the things this picture<br />has that a lot of action films don't.
1891807 1898807 And all the pictures that have imitated<br />the action beats of the <i>Die Hard</i> movies
1899689 1905526 have all missed the point because <i>Die Hard</i><br />is successful because everybody in it is cool
1905695 1907732 and real things happen to them.
1907906 1913367 And you don't only see the war,<br />you see the context of the war.
1913537 1915198 These people get smashed
1915372 1920082 and there are all kinds of opportunists and<br />parasites and leeches around the outside
1920252 1925747 that are knowingly ripping people off<br />in order to make the most out of this.
1926591 1929424 <i>JOHN:</i> The camera starts and<br />this whole sequence moves
1929594 1931255 and really never stops moving.
1931430 1935674 And had it not been for Frank Urioste<br />and his encouragement,
1935851 1937518 I never would have gotten away with it.
1937602 1942938 I nearly got fired on <i>Predator</i><br />for shooting things with camera movement,
1943108 1946521 and the editor said,<br />"That's against the rules."
1948113 1953449 People have commented<br />that there seems to be a lot of
1953618 1958033 that you don't notice the crampedness for a<br />movie that takes place all in one building.
1958206 1963326 But actually,<br />the drama takes place in one building,
1963503 1968043 and it needn't be any bigger<br />than the stage of the drama.
1968675 1971133 And there are circumstances where
1971303 1975718 you could conceive of a drama<br />that takes place entirely on a table top,
1975891 1977991 and if you got yourself close enough to it
1978101 1984393 and learned enough of the specifics of<br />the shape and geography of that table top
1984566 1987934 and how it intersected with the drama,
1989488 1992073 you could, in theory,<br />make a whole movie on a table top.
1992157 1997277 It's just a matter of changing scale.<br />You get closer to it, it gets bigger.
2000040 2003790 <i>JACKSON:</i> That's the secret to action<br />movies - everything has to make sense.
2005086 2006497 And you can't cheat.
2006671 2012667 All that stuff about "They'll never know"<br />is total bullshit. They always know.
2017974 2020181 The great reveal.
2021061 2023428 Looks like a crab.
2023605 2027894 I so love this door. It<br />was so hard to build.
2028276 2031769 It's wood sheathed in stainless steel.
2031947 2034780 There's an awful lot<br />to learn about this craft.
2034950 2037783 People are coming in unprepared.
2037953 2040121 It's one of the things we're trying to do<br />in the guild:
2040205 2044164 get them exposure to people<br />that have been doing it forever.
2044543 2047831 There's talent,<br />and then there's professionalism.
2048547 2050712 Look at these foreground pieces going by.
2050882 2054466 That accelerates the action<br />and the movement, you know.
2054636 2058755 It's like a bamboo grove, you know,<br />with many tall, thin things.
2059849 2062591 <i>JOHN:</i> Here, what I increasingly was doing
2062769 2068856 was connecting repeated shots with a camera<br />move, instead of the traditional way it's done.
2069025 2073861 See, every one of these is a separate<br />shot, but they're tied together with a pan.
2074030 2076943 That takes an editor who will tolerate
2077117 2081907 you deciding which picture<br />goes after which, to some extent.
2082664 2087625 But also it's a sense of the chain of the<br />movement and the rhythm of the movement.
2087794 2093039 I would shoot four or five versions of every<br />one of those little shots with different speeds,
2093216 2097756 and he'd have to find<br />the set of three that felt like
2097929 2100887 they were all notes<br />in the same piece of music.
2103101 2107436 <i>JACKSON:</i> Look at that - the fluorescent<br />tubes laying there at the base of the floor,
2107606 2110143 lighting those walls -<br />Jan just did a fabulous job.
2110317 2115187 This could have been so nothing, this<br />space. The lighting has a lot to do with it.
2116948 2120657 <i>JOHN:</i> I've always, even though<br />I'm probably musically illiterate,
2120827 2124195 I've found myself thinking of movies<br />as musical structures.
2125915 2130455 A lot of people think that they're books<br />or print, or somehow based on print,
2130629 2135374 and they try to apply print logic to film,
2135550 2138633 and personally, I don't think it works.
2138803 2145596 I grew up around opera, and even though I'm<br />musically illiterate, I think in musical forms.
2146519 2150478 <i>JACKSON:</i> I've tried to do a bit of writing<br />about the process,
2150649 2157362 but it's not something that you can really<br />reduce to a rational process. It's not rational.
2157530 2163196 Everything you are and that you've learned<br />in your life responds to a piece of writing.
2163370 2165532 And then it just comes out.
2165705 2169198 But it's like asking somebody,<br />"Well, how do you write?"
2170293 2172079 How do you breathe?
2172253 2175712 It mostly happens on an unconscious level,
2175882 2179045 and most of the best stuff<br />comes out after you've slept on it.
2179219 2181677 Try not to react too soon.
2181846 2184304 Look at that sweater he's wearing.
2184474 2190311 <i>JOHN:</i> Something that's always bothered me<br />about films is the print preoccupation.
2190480 2194690 You can listen to a piece of music and<br />the print aspect of it is not important.
2194859 2199319 I think eventually people will<br />get good enough with films
2199489 2204199 that the film itself will be just...<br />will be the end in and of itself,
2204369 2211162 and they won't say, "Does this represent<br />some particular book-based set of ideas?"
2211459 2217375 Like that sequence that just went by there<br />- it's the four shots leading up to the saw.
2217549 2220257 They all seem to be of a piece
2220427 2223761 and they're all moving shots<br />with two or three elements in them.
2223930 2230097 So they're at least musically in the same<br />key, I guess is the way you think of it.
2231521 2234138 <i>JACKSON:</i> I love sets you can destroy like<br />this.
2234524 2240440 I'm a realist. Things that are real are much<br />more interesting than things you think up.
2240613 2245528 Spectacle movies that don't have strong<br />ideas behind them are window dressing
2245702 2247363 they become decorative.
2247537 2252282 It's just like good architecture: it's based on<br />necessity. That's what the modernists taught.
2252459 2256418 That's what Mies van der Rohe<br />and the Bauhaus was all about.
2257338 2261957 And form follows, not function, but story.
2262135 2267756 And this is a realistic story. Even though it's<br />an adventure, it's based on the real world.
2267932 2271141 It's not doing things for effect.<br />I mean, that's cheating.
2271311 2277557 We had to figure this out. This has to make<br />sense or it's not scary, it's just a movie.
2277734 2283320 And the way this looks, that's the way<br />it would look if the lights were there.
2283490 2288951 The red castle is...<br />McTiernan really likes naval history,
2289120 2293910 and he gave me the job of figuring out<br />what the code word was.
2294083 2297872 So Takagi had served in World War ll,<br />or his family had...
2299297 2304792 The head of the company served in the<br />Japanese Navy in World War II on the <i>Akagi,</i>
2304969 2308712 which was an aircraft carrier.<br />It means "red castle".
2312018 2314885 <i>JOHN:</i> Eventually it may be possible<br />to make movies
2315063 2320149 where every image has nuance,<br />the way music has nuance,
2320318 2323151 and every image in a dream has nuance.
2323321 2329693 You don't necessarily know the meaning<br />of a picture, but you feel it.
2329869 2333783 You feel it has meaning and it's<br />connected to something somehow.
2333957 2337040 It expresses a feeling in your dream.
2337210 2340498 Eventually there'll be a visual Beethoven
2340672 2346338 who can make every image have the<br />intensity and the nuance of a dream,
2346511 2353224 and you won't think about the text, the<br />words that are represented by the pictures.
2353518 2355770 You'll just simply have<br />the visual experience.
2355854 2360564 One doesn't ask a musical experience<br />to prove itself or translate itself,
2360733 2365102 and I think music can simply<br />be dramatic on its own.
2365822 2368122 That theoretical Beethoven<br />may get to the point
2368283 2374199 where he'll get his audience to stop asking<br />for the pictures to be translated into words.
2376624 2381744 <i>JACKSON:</i> All this had to be worked out - how<br />this would happen if you could really do this.
2381921 2384288 And, you know, you can really do this
2384465 2387924 all the stuff that happens<br />with the elevators.
2388094 2391587 So the thing you have to do is<br />you have to have strong ideas
2391764 2396884 and you have to pursue them ferociously,<br />wherever they may lead,
2397061 2401350 as long as you got time, money<br />and stamina, everybody's stamina.
2401524 2405524 Remember there were people that couldn't<br />stand up that were building these things
2405612 2407979 and painting these things because they
2408156 2411444 you work seven days a week -<br />a 10 or 12 hour shift.
2411618 2415577 After two or three weeks,<br />you're just semi-conscious.
2415747 2419661 Just go as far as you can<br />and then you get to amazing places.
2419834 2423998 That's what this movie had,<br />and everybody involved did that.
2428718 2432336 <i>JOHN:</i> Did you notice that every one<br />of those shots started with a dolly?
2432513 2437974 Leading into that elevator shot. But more<br />than that, it also starts with a dolly move
2438144 2443139 that's sympathetic with<br />the dolly moves that preceded it.
2443733 2448478 Part of the sense of camera movement<br />that I was working on here...
2448655 2452649 I do it less self-consciously now,<br />but I still try to do the same thing as...
2452825 2455863 Your own eyes move around constantly,
2456037 2461203 and there are things about a picture<br />that lead you to the next picture,
2461376 2463083 and your eyes move there.
2463252 2467462 And if you set it up right with a camera,<br />you don't have to cut.
2467632 2473298 The audience's eyes want to go with you<br />to wherever the camera move is going.
2478768 2481729 <i>JACKSON:</i> The whole thing about<br />the geography of the building
2481813 2484513 and what floor they're on<br />and back and forth with stuff
2484649 2487516 was rigorously worked out.
2487694 2492439 It wasn't considered important<br />in the beginning, but it became...
2492782 2496366 Art department people are<br />obsessive about stuff like that.
2496536 2500746 Where is he? What is the number?<br />What number is he going to run by?
2500915 2505705 How is that going to tell you...<br />What information are you gonna get?
2505878 2507869 It's a real elevator shaft.
2508047 2512132 And Willis did ride<br />the top of the elevator.
2512844 2514585 Scared the shit out of me.
2514762 2518300 That's him in a real elevator.<br />He's really doing that.
2521102 2525391 We may have done the top.<br />Now this is a set.
2525565 2529684 You could never actually do that in<br />a real elevator - get him so close to it.
2529861 2532321 <i>JOHN:</i> I've been asked<br />how planned that approach is.
2532405 2536649 I guess when I started,<br />it was elaborately planned.
2536826 2542162 Now I sort of... It's as if I have a<br />melody in my head and I hum the melody.
2542957 2545699 Although it's a visual humming.
2545877 2550542 When I first started to make films<br />I drew diagrams of the length of every cut
2550715 2554593 and all sorts of nonsense<br />dramatic theories,
2554677 2557169 and eventually it...
2557346 2564346 Most of them weren't very useful in that,<br />rather than make a cut where the theory said,
2565146 2569390 you did a lot better if you just made<br />the cut where it felt like you should cut.
2569567 2574403 The hard part was learning to trust<br />where that feeling was.
2574572 2578440 And Frank Urioste was<br />particularly helpful for that
2578618 2581701 cos it turned out his father<br />had been a composer
2581871 2584533 a composer in the movie business<br />and a music cutter.
2584707 2588746 And he personally<br />just thought of cutting as music
2588920 2591958 because he came from a music background.
2592131 2596125 <i>JACKSON:</i> I thought that<br />at this point in their careers,
2596302 2599340 McTiernan and Silver were<br />a perfect match for each other
2599514 2603052 because it was McTiernan's<br />honesty and intelligence
2603684 2606093 And Silver's showmanship at this point.
2606187 2610647 They gave each other more of<br />those qualities than they normally have.
2610900 2617021 Silver was very much into a big-picture mode<br />and glamour and old Hollywood kind of thing.
2617198 2620617 And I don't care if it makes sense<br />and McTiernan cares if it makes sense
2620701 2625537 and he doesn't care how glamorous it is.<br />He's like, "Make it march."
2625706 2629370 So between the two of 'em, you got both.
2629585 2634204 <i>JOHN:</i> Yeah. And part of not cutting<br />and trying to just connect things,
2634382 2637875 was about giving the audience<br />the sense that it was real.
2638052 2640885 When you get him up<br />on top of the building there,
2641055 2643387 you actually go 180 degrees or something
2643558 2647847 and say, "Oh, we're actually<br />up on top of this building."
2648020 2651354 I can't claim to be the first one<br />who ever thought of that.
2651524 2653731 A "nothing" set that really works.
2653943 2656651 What do I think about multiple cameras?
2656821 2658607 I don't use them, actually.
2658781 2662490 But using multiple<br />cameras is just if you're...
2663369 2667784 This is gonna sound so arrogant, but<br />if you don't know where you're gonna cut
2667957 2672918 and you're hoping that one of them gets<br />there accidentally, you get a lot of cameras.
2673087 2675078 An old cameraman...
2675256 2679295 He wasn't that old, but Don McAlpine,<br />the Australian guy, when I did <i>Predator,</i>
2679468 2683257 I asked him if we should be<br />using more cameras and he said,
2683431 2685638 "Which one are you gonna look at?"
2685808 2689353 Meaning, you can't really do your job<br />on more than one camera at a time.
2689437 2692680 So you use multiple cameras on a stunt,
2692857 2697146 on things where it's very hard<br />to physically reproduce it,
2697320 2700858 and just for economic reasons<br />you've got five or six cameras out there.
2701032 2708029 So actually I shot the helicopter sequence<br />in this two-hour period on a Sunday night
2708623 2714460 cos it was an enormous bureaucratic thing<br />to get the helicopters into those buildings.
2714629 2717929 The only way I could get all the coverage<br />is I got six camera crews
2718174 2722088 and I gave them all instructions of<br />what shots they were supposed to get
2722261 2725845 and we ran the helicopters through<br />four times, I think.
2726015 2732853 And once a cameraman got the first assigned<br />shot, he'd move on to his next assigned shot.
2733022 2737687 For that I used multiple cameras, but<br />just about nowhere else did we ever do it.
2737860 2740067 And I still don't.
2740238 2744482 <i>JACKSON:</i> Reginald VelJohnson<br />had an amazing career after this
2744659 2746570 his own TV series and everything.
2746744 2750362 Must be a gazillionaire.<br />He's sure wonderful.
2780486 2783524 In the meantime, up on the roof...
2793416 2796454 <i>JOHN:</i> One of the nice things<br />that Jan de Bont brought
2796627 2801872 was tolerance of what appear to be<br />photographic flaws
2802049 2805462 like the flares all over<br />the place and things.
2805636 2811052 Actually, he was sticking flares<br />and lights here and there constantly.
2813019 2815260 And we made it a style.
2816355 2820770 We used as many photographic flaws<br />and things as possible.
2821527 2825862 This film is anamorphic. I had<br />tried to shoot <i>Predator</i> in anamorphic
2826032 2831527 and they hadn't been able to convince<br />somebody in the studio bureaucracy
2831704 2833411 because it cost more money.
2833581 2837666 But at the time, it was a...
2837835 2843706 People didn't shoot with it unless<br />they had some specific reason.
2843883 2846841 My personal sense was that<br />it was a cheap special effect
2847011 2849503 cos it looks like a big movie
2849680 2854641 with just the simple distortion<br />that comes from anamorphic.
2867323 2870657 <i>JACKSON:</i> This is a real ventilation<br />shaft.
2870826 2875992 It's an amazing thing. They go all the way<br />down the building through the shaft.
2878959 2880908 Back to the set.
2881921 2884208 <i>JOHN:</i> We just started using stuff that...
2884382 2887875 Bruce happened to look at the girl<br />who went by, in the airport scene,
2888052 2892637 and we kept using it,<br />and then I used it here as geography.
2892807 2895309 <i>JACKSON:</i> That's the reason he touched it -<br />so you know where he was.
2895393 2897930 He's at the top of the<br />elevator shafts now.
2898104 2900687 Set, set, set.
2900856 2903348 Point of view of real elevator shaft.
2909532 2913150 It's beautifully worked out, this action.
2915496 2919906 Set.
2920084 2923452 <i>JOHN:</i> Jack DeGovia<br />is the designer on this film.
2923629 2926621 Jack's the best designer<br />I've ever worked with.
2926799 2928881 I would work with him continually,
2929051 2932721 except he's also probably the most<br />expensive designer I've ever worked with.
2932805 2939222 He's a delight. He's filled with ideas and<br />he's somebody you can actually talk drama with
2939395 2941557 and talk the story with,
2941730 2948730 as opposed to: "Wouldn't it be nice to have<br />this kind of furniture here in this scene?"
2949738 2953322 <i>JACKSON:</i> This is one of my<br />favorite things. OK, this is a set.
2953492 2960492 How is he going to get across the shaft<br />into the duct work?
2962251 2965084 How are we going to shoot this?
2967256 2969623 OK, that's a painted backing.
2970718 2977385 <i>JOHN:</i> Rather than special-effecting in<br />a photographic, we're putting in
2977558 2980721 that's just a painting<br />covering the mattress.
2981896 2985935 This sequence actually took a long time.
2986108 2991103 We had the stunt people shooting it,<br />climbing down into the duct.
2991280 2996616 And the second or third time they attempted<br />to shoot the thing, the stunt man fell.
2997620 3001320 And we thought, "Oh, it didn't work again.<br />We're gonna have to start over."
3002082 3004289 <i>JACKSON:</i> He actually drops toward it.
3004460 3007578 This made the editor<br />stand up straight in dailies.
3007755 3011248 The stunt man fell into an air<br />bag underneath. He just fell.
3012259 3017595 <i>JOHN:</i> Frank Urioste said, "Wait a minute,<br />isn't there some way we could use this?"
3017765 3020632 He said, "Suppose we let the guy fall."
3020809 3025019 And I gotta say, he came up with<br />the essence of this sequence,
3025189 3027180 cos it wasn't scripted that way.
3027358 3031602 We hadn't planned on having him fall<br />and save himself.
3032571 3035154 Now, that was an accident right there.
3035324 3039158 We thought we'd blown the shot<br />and had to start over.
3039328 3043663 <i>JACKSON:</i> It made the editor stand up -<br />he thought somebody had really fallen.
3043832 3046119 In the uncut shot,<br />he just keeps going down.
3046293 3048455 He thought he was dead.
3048629 3054500 <i>JOHN:</i> This little moment, this line,<br />Steve De Souza phoned in.
3054677 3058045 We kept looking for ways<br />to get places for Bruce to be Bruce.
3058305 3061263 The TV-dinner line was the one<br />that De Souza phoned in.
3061433 3064016 We shot maybe eight different lines.
3064937 3069522 <i>JACKSON:</i> There are some continuity errors<br />that were not the fault of Wardrobe.
3069692 3073060 It's because things<br />were shot out of continuity.
3073237 3078573 And so his undershirt gets more or less<br />clean or dirty out of order a little bit.
3079535 3085156 <i>JOHN:</i> We shortened the next shot and people<br />thought Bruce's T-shirt changed color.
3086125 3092292 <i>JACKSON:</i> That's gonna happen, so you make<br />sure nothing happens because you caused it.
3092464 3096458 There's enough unavoidable stuff<br />that has to be accepted.
3096635 3099844 So you don't want it sneaking in<br />just because you're sloppy.
3100014 3103928 And everybody who worked on<br />this picture was far from sloppy.
3104101 3110268 <i>JOHN:</i> We were talking about language<br />and trying to get language out of movies.
3110441 3112808 The movie I'm working on right now,
3112985 3116863 the whole movie is in a foreign language<br />except specific lines that are important.
3116947 3121191 But the rest of the time, I've<br />contrived it so it's perfectly plausible
3121368 3125612 that any line that doesn't matter for<br />the story is said in some other language.
3125789 3128872 And there's no subtitles, no nothing.
3130377 3136498 My notion is that a lot of times<br />what's expressive in words
3136675 3139463 is the sound of the words,
3139637 3142846 rather than the specific meaning of them.
3145184 3147561 This is ridiculous -<br />you don't want to know about all this,
3147645 3152185 but there's this shrink who has done<br />all this work with autistic children
3152358 3155100 it's a guy who's given up shrinkdom.
3156654 3158236 He's a marketing expert
3158572 3161908 for a lot of large corporations<br />and he makes millions of dollars a year
3161992 3166782 telling corporations what people<br />really mean by particular phrases
3166955 3170698 or what they actually<br />think about something.
3170876 3173243 He's done all this work<br />with autistic children
3173420 3177880 and he's found that the reason they don't<br />speak isn't they don't have that mechanism,
3178050 3180917 it's cos their emotional<br />equipment is fucked up.
3181095 3183382 Consequently, they have no reason to speak
3183555 3189767 because speech is first of all not a coded<br />meeting, not a way to communicate to others.
3189937 3194898 It is purely a way to translate<br />emotion into noise.
3195067 3200688 And if you have no reason to express<br />emotion as noise, you won't speak.
3200864 3202901 That's what it is first.
3203075 3206158 I grew up watching foreign movies,<br />studying foreign movies.
3206328 3208410 I never bothered to read the subtitles.
3208580 3211708 Often if I saw the movie a second time<br />and did read the subtitles,
3211792 3217708 or certainly if I heard a dubbed film,<br />the movie would fall flat. <i>[LAUGHS]</i>
3217923 3223965 It was far better when the words were just<br />an expression... were like a movie score.
3237276 3240487 The mechanics of this movie,<br />since we were shooting all over the place,
3240571 3245361 was keeping the tie-togethers...
3245534 3249619 Officially you could call it continuity,<br />but it wasn't really continuity.
3249788 3255249 It's making it so the shots would physically<br />tie together or emotionally tie together,
3255669 3259913 as if they were in<br />a particular orientation to one another.
3307930 3310056 <i>JACKSON:</i> This is<br />the teen horror movie moment.
3310140 3314225 "Let's split up." <i>[LAUGHS]</i><br />"Go down and take care of him."
3314394 3317477 <i>JOHN:</i> Nice touch -<br />he's wearing the cowboy boots.
3351557 3354675 Anybody else would have racked focus.
3367114 3371324 Yes, he's going to get it<br />right through the Nakatomi.
3436725 3441640 <i>JACKSON:</i> That's a set - the shot of Bruce<br />through the broken window.
3443565 3445897 Argyle completely...
3447152 3452488 <i>JOHN:</i> I guess part of trying to keep<br />a sense of humor in the film,
3453241 3456199 so that when ultimately it does get heavy,
3456370 3461365 you haven't exhausted the audience...<br />Portentous it always beforehand.
3461541 3466081 <i>JACKSON:</i> Good stunt here.<br />So real, you know? Totally believable.
3466254 3469417 I like the fact the flowers ended up<br />inside the car.
3469591 3474427 This is one of the first really disruptive<br />location movies, you know.
3475138 3479090 You can imagine - with all those<br />very expensive condos across the street
3479267 3483010 and setting off guns and bombs<br />and blowing out windows in the night.
3483188 3488854 Flying helicopters under 500 feet up<br />Avenue of the Stars, where the movie...
3489027 3491564 This was a real studio, I think.
3493156 3496569 <i>JOHN:</i> And now we're getting<br />the outside sequences.
3496743 3501829 We actually shot this building that is<br />now usually called the Nakatomi Tower...
3502082 3506827 It belonged to Fox at the time. They thought<br />it was a great idea to shoot their movie in it,
3507004 3510622 and then they realized that<br />they had all these law firms...
3510799 3513968 <i>JACKSON:</i> I don't think it would be<br />possible today to do what we did.
3514052 3516596 People are more powerful<br />and have franchised themselves
3516680 3518180 to take control of their lives
3518265 3521512 Because they've organized,<br />they've complained.
3521685 3524894 Otherwise, the entire city<br />would become a back lot
3525063 3527646 <i>[LAUGHS]</i> shooting 24 hours a day.
3527816 3534816 There are some poor streets in Hollywood<br />with rows of wonderful period bungalows
3535032 3540402 where during TV season<br />there are movie trucks there every week.
3540579 3542411 There have to be rules.
3542581 3544822 <i>JOHN:</i> There's an unmotivated move,
3545000 3550291 which, if I didn't have Frank Urioste,<br />would never have wound up in the movie.
3550464 3552922 I could have shot it,<br />but I'd never get it best.
3553091 3556719 I'd have had a giant fight with the<br />editor, who'd go behind my back and say,
3556803 3558803 "This guy doesn't know what he's doing."
3558972 3564513 But European filmmakers had been making<br />moves that were motivated on emotion,
3564686 3568805 rather than on<br />the physical movement of the character.
3569483 3573852 They'd been doing it for 30 years. It just<br />hadn't been done in American movies.
3574029 3581029 And I think probably Paul Verhoeven<br />was the first of the directors working
3581495 3587662 at least when I had come to awareness -<br />who had the nerve to do that sort of stuff.
3587834 3591668 And he created a lot of freedom for<br />a lot of the rest of us to pursue things.
3591838 3593795 And now it's gotten a bit silly.
3593965 3598084 You've got rock videos that are<br />spinning in circles and going up and down,
3598261 3601219 usually or often for no reason at all.
3605185 3609520 <i>JACKSON:</i> I wanted to show these screens<br />without rice paper.
3610273 3613186 I always liked those. They divide space.
3613360 3616068 It's like a fence, rather than a wall.
3617072 3622363 <i>JOHN:</i> The old conservative establishment<br />in the States, when I started working,
3622536 3624868 had a notion called zero point cinema,
3625038 3631831 which is a completely neutral cinema<br />that has no expression of the author.
3632003 3637749 And it had all sorts of rules which are not<br />unlike the Dogme movement in Europe now.
3639928 3644923 <i>JACKSON:</i> All these doors are<br />out of Japanese military architecture.
3645100 3648684 <i>JOHN: In the beginning of Red October,</i><br />I had actually replaced
3649020 3651811 an Academy Award-winning editor
3651982 3656351 because he literally didn't know<br />how to deal with the stuff I was shooting.
3656528 3659611 With physical movements,<br />he didn't know how to make the cuts.
3659781 3664491 He's a very fine editor and he's<br />a lovely man - I liked him a lot,
3664661 3667619 but I was sort of devastated<br />because I had to...
3667789 3671157 Actually, I kept him in the movie after<br />as an actor.
3671334 3673416 <i>JACKSON:</i> That's our little newsroom set.
3673587 3675828 I always liked these little graphics.
3676006 3678748 This carpet - good<br />thing to use on a video.
3678925 3681132 Very simple.
3684306 3690518 <i>JOHN:</i> Michael Kamen, he has<br />a wonderful sense of play in his score.
3690687 3695648 The slightly ironic, facetious sense that the<br />movie has, we were trying to get throughout,
3695817 3698058 he picked up on<br />when he saw the movie silent.
3699905 3705617 So he has the little repeats of the Christmas<br />carols and various things woven through.
3705785 3708618 And he helps with the thing<br />we've been talking about
3708788 3711450 how you deal with the comedy<br />in something like this
3711625 3713912 so that it doesn't impinge on the story.
3714085 3720127 Very often the music will let the audience<br />know, "It's OK to think this is ridiculous
3720300 3723418 cos the storytellers<br />think this is ridiculous."
3726973 3731183 <i>JACKSON:</i> We deliberately<br />gave his rig a kind of...
3732187 3737307 I always liked the way<br />that special-effects rigs look
3737484 3741102 because they're all machined<br />and made on lathes by hand.
3741529 3744521 And this whole deal with<br />the drill and the set,
3744699 3748408 I told AI, "Just make it the way<br />you would make it if you were doing it."
3748578 3751787 And that's how it turns out<br />cos it's beautifully machined.
3751957 3755541 But you don't polish anything<br />or finish anything
3755710 3757997 it just is.
3762217 3765084 And I like this set, the computer floor.
3766137 3772509 The basic idea was at that time, they built<br />false floors for computers out of tile
3772686 3777681 so they could run all the big cables and stuff,<br />cos computer terminals were like ice boxes.
3777857 3782317 And we just took that floor and ran it up<br />over the walls and the ceilings
3782487 3784694 and made this whole crosshatch thing.
3784864 3791031 So when he started shooting, McTiernan did a<br /><i>Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</i> - now, there's a...
3791204 3796324 He referenced that, and you'll see that.<br />He all of a sudden goes into Dutch angles.
3796501 3801166 So you see these lines running<br />across at an angle. It's really good.
3803133 3806626 <i>JOHN:</i> Watch how every time there's a cut,
3806803 3811969 it looks like they're in relation<br />to one another in one way or another.
3812142 3815055 These two scenes are shot<br />close to four months apart.
3815228 3818562 At the time I was more<br />formal than I am now,
3818732 3822817 and I literally graphed it out so that<br />when one moved the other would move
3822986 3827822 and when one changed sides of the camera,<br />the other changed sides of the camera.
3833955 3837833 <i>JACKSON:</i> Some film stocks really shout<br />blue. There's a lot of blue in this picture.
3837917 3840750 But I don't paint it<br />in, it's always there.
3841421 3843253 It's tricky.
3843423 3849715 It's a lighting issue and it's a film stock<br />issue. I mean, it's very strong in some stocks.
3849888 3852846 I don't really have a color palette<br />that I'm aware of.
3853016 3857966 I mean, I do probably, but I'm not aware of it. I<br />try not to be aware of it, let me put it that way.
3858605 3865147 And I'll make choices, you know, based on<br />what we're forced into by the locations.
3865320 3869573 First of all, that's where you have to start,<br />what you know you're going to have there.
3869657 3873525 First of all, we had to go with the<br />building. Second of all, it was Wrightian.
3873703 3876821 And third of all, there was all the stone<br />and gray and stuff
3876998 3883711 and we were in mechanical spaces, which are<br />all grays and that rust red primer color.
3883880 3887123 The color of machinery,<br />of steel, you know.
3887300 3891137 So when you try to put it all together<br />you gotta put it together with what is,
3891221 3894009 and then you amplify that<br />and you make it strong.
3894182 3898597 And, I mean, a lot of the colors in the<br />interior are on the exterior of the building.
3898770 3903936 That's why it's all of a piece,<br />all those red browns, stainless steel,
3904109 3906817 black and white.
3906986 3911446 I think it's death for a production designer<br />to start thinking about his own style.
3911616 3916577 If you're gonna be referential, self-referential,<br />it's the worst referential you can be.
3916830 3922792 You can't be aware... It's like an actor being<br />aware of his performance - it never works.
3925213 3929582 I hated that damn antenna<br />that was up and just flopped around.
3929759 3932126 It looks like, you know, a weenie.
3933179 3936638 And he ended up driving<br />over every shard of junk. <i>[LAUGHS]</i>
3937475 3941514 But the world has a style<br />if you're looking at parts of it.
3941688 3945397 And it's really a matter of,<br />you know, making sure
3945567 3952155 that those industrial things get into the<br />decorated things so that it makes a piece.
3952323 3955736 Look at her top.<br />It's in the palette, you know.
3955910 3958322 It's a major color, that rust red.
3965336 3972336 <i>JOHN:</i> I think the shoot was about, I<br />don't know, 80 days, midway. 85, 86 days.
3973428 3978639 We weren't particularly late, and I think<br />by the time we got on the home stretch,
3978808 3982676 the studio had seen enough of the movie<br />and were quite happy
3982854 3986690 and mostly wanted us to get it done so<br />we could get it finished and get it out.
3986774 3988981 I don't like a movie to be...
3989152 3993352 Even if you think it will take more than 80<br />days, I'd hate to schedule more than that
3993448 3997112 because everybody just slows down<br />and the energy goes out of it.
4001331 4005916 I don't think a movie should be scheduled for<br />more than 80 days. It shouldn't take longer.
4006085 4010420 Some things with special effects in them,<br />I can understand why they take longer.
4010590 4015756 But taking longer to shoot than that<br />is a... in effect,
4015929 4020173 is a decision that will determine<br />the style of the movie, actually.
4020350 4022432 And it's not an improvement.
4022602 4025890 It doesn't get better because<br />you spent more time shooting it.
4026064 4029398 A certain amount of simple kinetic energy
4029567 4036360 is often more intuitive and effective than<br />if you slow down and stop and think about it.
4037158 4039320 It doesn't necessarily get better.
4039494 4043488 The last time I let a movie get<br />over 85 days was <i>Last Action Hero,</i>
4043665 4050537 and since then I've insisted that<br />we run about 75 days for a movie.
4053841 4056629 <i>JACKSON:</i> Argyle, didn't you<br />ever have to take a pee?
4056803 4062173 Always doing all that drinking<br />and partying in there?
4062350 4063306 Fortunately,
4063643 4063934 they were building next door. It gave<br />us this wonderful construction site.
4064018 4069063 They were building next door. It<br />gave us this wonderful construction site.
4069232 4073897 McTiernan's got a great eye for faces -<br />something he does really, really well.
4074070 4076653 All these characters are unmistakable.
4076823 4081363 So you're never in any doubt,<br />except with the terrorists.
4081536 4085575 Aside from Godunov,<br />they're interchangeable.
4085748 4089332 They're all kind of German looking,<br />but that's right.
4089502 4092836 And everybody who has got<br />a part of advancing the action,
4093006 4095418 you'll always know who they are.
4096551 4100340 <i>JOHN:</i> In terms of dealing with inserts<br />and small bits and pieces, shots,
4100513 4105098 I will often run a kind<br />of internal second unit.
4105268 4110980 We'll leave some guys behind or have them<br />go ahead and handle the long setup shots,
4111149 4115768 like that stunt shot where the guy was<br />going down the shaft and fell.
4115945 4120155 Now, that's a setup that<br />took four men two days.
4120325 4123534 So, I use a second<br />unit for that sort of thing.
4123703 4125694 Most of the rest of it, I shoot myself,
4125872 4132039 unless it's a physical thing where somebody<br />else can do it just as well or better than I.
4133046 4136539 On <i>The Thomas Crown Affair</i><br />I had somebody else shoot the aerial stuff
4136716 4140254 cos it's silly to have me flying around<br />when somebody else could.
4140428 4145093 And I'd set the style and<br />I'd looked at the material.
4145266 4150511 For the first two days, I looked at every shot.<br />Then I got out of the way and let them work.
4151105 4156441 In this film, I think I<br />shot just about all of it,
4156778 4159941 including silly things like<br />this thing coming up here.
4160114 4164199 The terrorist coming down with<br />the hundreds of rounds of ammunition
4164369 4169990 and then being a little uncertain about<br />whether or not he should steal a bar of candy.
4173127 4176589 <i>JACKSON:</i> Another good thing about<br />the building is it had these terraces,
4176673 4181759 so you could put lights outside and<br />light up certain windows. It helped a lot.
4181928 4185796 It's an artifact now, you know.<br />It's part of art history.
4185973 4190934 You could make the point, it's like<br />the Empire State Building and King Kong
4191938 4195021 can't use it any more, it's been done.
4195191 4199936 But in a sense - we were talking last night -<br /><i>Die Hard</i> did it for this kind of action movie.
4200113 4202195 It's like, you know, it's been done.
4202365 4208236 And since <i>Die Hard</i> everything has been<br /><i>Die Hard</i> on a... or <i>Die Hard</i> in a...
4214585 4217463 <i>JOHN:</i> I doubt the SWAT guy<br />hitting the roses is a big laugh.
4217547 4223543 But I think the intention was to suggest<br />to the audience that, you know,
4223720 4226303 it shouldn't take all of<br />this all that seriously.
4226472 4230966 I mean, part of my personal melody for all<br />this is something I've said in the past.
4231144 4235308 I don't know if it's important,<br />but my own notion was that
4235481 4240146 it should be like <i>Midsummer Night's<br />Dream</i> - Shakespearean comedy.
4240319 4244529 It's a story that happens on a festival<br />night and it all happens in one night
4244699 4249489 and something happens that turns all the<br />princes to asses and all the asses to princes
4249662 4251862 and in the morning<br />the two lovers are united
4251998 4257084 and everybody goes home feeling better<br />for what had happened that night.
4257253 4262168 And I sort of used that as the guide<br />for the plot and some specific things.
4262341 4266426 I think in the original script<br />this story happened over three days.
4266596 4268507 I physically moved it to one day.
4268681 4273050 And it dictated things,<br />like don't make the cops too serious here.
4274562 4279181 So that's how we got Paul,<br />who was just delightful and hysterical.
4279358 4282396 I don't know what he can do<br />in his life that's serious.
4282570 4286529 He can take the most serious thing<br />and make it ridiculous.
4287533 4289660 <i>JACKSON:</i> Comedy and action<br />are very similar.
4289744 4293282 I've kind of been typecast, you know,<br />in those two genres.
4293456 4296198 I haven't done a lot of drama.
4296375 4299367 They all depend on action, you know.
4299712 4302204 They all have huge physical elements
4302423 4306917 and they all have to be very tightly<br />structured in terms of the action.
4307094 4311053 Both comedy and action films<br />have to make sense on a physical level
4311224 4317721 and on the interaction between the physical...<br />between the actors and the stuff, you know.
4317897 4319898 They're based on timing.
4319982 4323646 I guess the reason I've been able<br />to do both those genres well
4323820 4329566 is because they're very similar<br />from a design point of view.
4329742 4332905 I mean, yeah, OK, maybe you use<br />different kinds of colors,
4333079 4339325 but the thing about it is that what's revealed<br />and when and all that are very important.
4340211 4343044 Drama tends to be atmospheric, you know.
4343214 4346081 It's like a surround, a womb,<br />that contains the action.
4346259 4350127 But in action and comedy<br />the sets are major players.
4351222 4355637 I could tell the back story,<br />which was very important, on DAT
4355810 4357926 you know, just try and keep it real.
4358104 4361187 But it's not the same, not the same.
4361357 4365521 The thing about comedy<br />and action films is the speed
4365695 4370735 you know, how close together things have to<br />be... Like this, this and this. <i>[CLICKS FINGERS]</i>
4372952 4377492 What we tried to do was keep<br />the backstage feeling about it,
4378666 4381078 where it was played for broad comedy,
4381252 4387749 but just held in enough that the audience<br />didn't see us looking for the laughs.
4402356 4409103 <i>JOHN:</i> That's a World War II armored car that<br />some collector in Southern California had.
4410281 4414491 <i>JACKSON:</i> Scorpion, a British tank.<br />They're pretty indestructible.
4414660 4417329 You can set off a gasoline bomb in them<br />without hurting them.
4417413 4422624 I mean, it was from<br />a military equipment supplier.
4422793 4427708 It's just steel. And you take the seats<br />out and stuff that burns and blow them up.
4427882 4430169 They're designed to be blown up.
4447318 4450481 <i>JOHN:</i> Again here, the guy is yelling<br />in a foreign language
4450655 4453198 cos you don't really want to know<br />exactly what he's saying
4453282 4457150 about don't damage the rocket<br />and have it go off accidentally.
4457328 4463324 You just want to hear he's screaming<br />and he's angry about something or other.
4463501 4468917 <i>JACKSON:</i> This is... McTiernan designed<br />these things, in the sense that he knew
4469090 4470546 exactly what he wanted to do.
4470716 4474675 This shot... Bam!<br />That's how he wanted it to go together.
4474845 4478930 It was really terrific.<br />He had this whole thing in his mind.
4480393 4483431 That's our Christmas decor.<br />Another nod to Christmas,
4483604 4486562 just to keep you<br />unconsciously aware of it.
4486732 4488894 "OK, now what we want to do is,
4489068 4494905 we want to drive this armored car up the<br />front steps of your building, do you mind?"
4495241 4498108 "Well, do you think you'll hurt somebody?"<br />"Nah."
4498285 4501448 These guys... I mean,<br />Fox owned this building.
4501622 4505536 It was one of the most difficult<br />location negotiations ever.
4505710 4511171 <i>JOHN:</i> The negotiations - "You break that piece of railing..."<br />-went on for months.
4511340 4516005 I think the building charged us an<br />exorbitant amount of money for that railing.
4516178 4518378 I was sure it was made<br />of gold or something.
4529692 4533401 The explosions in the front of the<br />building are for the most part real.
4533571 4536609 I think we did some isolated<br />separate explosions,
4536782 4541242 but most of it is actually flashbulbs
4541996 4545705 and flash powder<br />and various small explosives
4545875 4548958 actually mounted on<br />the front of the building.
4549128 4553042 Larry Gordon was certain he wanted<br />to keep shooting more explosions
4553215 4557129 reshoot it or shoot a bigger one -<br />cos he'd only seen it in pieces.
4557303 4560637 And as we started showing him<br />the explosion cut together,
4560806 4565266 he eventually relented and said, "OK, we<br />won't have to blow up the building again."
4565436 4569225 <i>JACKSON:</i> McTiernan was great on this too -<br />making this bomb.
4569398 4571981 You know, he had this in his head too.
4572151 4576816 <i>JOHN:</i> On one of the nights of shooting<br />that elevator shaft you're looking at now,
4576989 4582826 we actually got caught in the elevator<br />shaft as we were going down to lunch,
4582995 4585407 which was probably about 8:30 at night.
4585581 4589916 And the elevator wouldn't move and it<br />wouldn't do any good to open the doors
4590086 4592874 because we were in a 200-foot-long<br />concrete shaft.
4593047 4595334 It was an express elevator.
4595508 4599046 There's the explosion there.<br />A lot of it is just flashbulbs,
4599220 4603555 but when you compound the effect together,<br />when you splice it all together,
4603724 4607262 it begins to look a lot larger<br />than any single piece of it was.
4607436 4611304 In the elevator, I think the eight<br />or nine of us spent three hours...
4611482 4615225 They had to bring another car down.<br />We went out through the emergency exit
4615402 4620272 and walked across from one shaft to<br />another and stepped onto another elevator
4620449 4624113 and went down through the roof<br />in order to get to the ground floor.
4624286 4630783 There were a few young crew members, and it<br />was interesting watching the older guys...
4630960 4634669 I think Frank Urioste, the editor,<br />happened to be in the elevator.
4634839 4637877 He'd been in World War Il<br />and was a tough guy,
4638050 4642465 and he just stood there,<br />making jokes for three hours.
4642638 4646552 He managed to keep all the kids calm<br />and no one panicked.
4646892 4651557 It was an interesting process to watch.<br />I learned a lot from that man.
4652940 4657776 That is... well, now ex...<br />Bob Zemekis's ex-wife.
4661240 4664528 This area was actually right behind<br />the actual building.
4664702 4668411 It was on the lot, it was on the Fox lot,
4668581 4672996 but it was conveniently about 200 feet<br />from the foot of the actual building,
4673169 4679415 so we could work back and forth<br />and tie it all together in single shots.
4681218 4684802 See that guy on the<br />left side of the screen?
4684972 4686963 He was a waiter in a restaurant.
4687141 4689428 He turned out to be a fabulous actor.
4689602 4694312 We used him in two more movies, I guess,<br />three more movies.
4694732 4697474 Actually, he died a couple of years ago.
4703824 4707738 He was a waiter in a restaurant<br />where I often had dinner,
4707912 4711906 and I discovered he'd done theater
4712082 4716997 and had a great normal<br />person's sense about him.
4717171 4720289 And it turned out he was great.
4720466 4723879 He kept this stuff alive<br />by just making up things.
4724678 4727430 And pretending to be talking<br />to all sorts of other people
4727514 4732634 and kept the reality for the actors working<br />around a couple of parked police cars.
4732811 4738227 And then in <i>Red October,</i> I got him...<br />I guess he's an executive officer.
4751755 4757400 <i>JACKSON:</i> It was real hard<br />making that rock look real.
4757503 4764503 I took everything away that looked unreal. If it<br />doesn't look real on the set, it won't on film.
4765219 4769508 It was sculptured, you know,<br />done to a deadline.
4769682 4773346 It's real hard to do - it's a<br />combination of sculpture and painting
4773519 4778480 to make something that on film looks real,<br />like a real rock. I don't know why that is.
4778649 4783894 I guess it's because sculptors are trained<br />to do the human figure rather than rocks.
4784071 4788321 It's one of the most difficult things. I<br />always end up doing this for McTiernan, too
4788409 4790059 trying to do some friggin' rocks.
4791287 4794780 <i>JOHN:</i> Alexander Godunov<br />was a Russian dancer
4794957 4797198 and not really done<br />any acting before this,
4797376 4799083 but he was very good.
4799253 4804089 He was the boyfriend and witness<br />and you saw him walking in at the end.
4805676 4811547 Hart, he'd been a television ingénue<br />straight guy for so long that,
4812266 4819266 when he cut loose on this, you could just tell<br />for years he'd been itching to be a comedian.
4820357 4822894 God, he was funny.
4823068 4826029 <i>JACKSON:</i> You know, I designed<br />this whole floor of the building,
4826113 4830027 and then John and Jan de Bont<br />between them,
4830200 4835161 Jan lit it and John decided where it was<br />going to take place after consulting with us.
4835331 4840952 But a lot with Jan... "What kind of a look<br />can I get in here? Blah, blah, blah..."
4841128 4843128 This kind of had to be the headquarters.
4843297 4847211 It was the boss' office, it's Bonnie's<br />office. So much happened here.
4847760 4853005 So we put it in a good place. They could walk<br />out the door and be there with the hostages.
4853182 4858973 And it's good looks in all directions<br />there. Totally enclosed - it's a 360 set.
4859146 4862059 So you just have to give them<br />a lot of opportunities,
4862232 4865020 a lot of different looks,<br />so you don't end up
4865194 4867652 only having one place<br />you can put the camera.
4874870 4877202 We had to replace all<br />the glass on this floor
4877373 4879833 so we could photograph<br />the lights out of the window.
4879917 4884377 One day, I walked up and the contractor<br />who was replacing the panes of glass,
4884546 4887664 which were six feet by five feet<br />or something like that...
4887841 4891550 There was this guy, workman,<br />belted to the outside of the building
4891720 4898308 and he had a new piece of glass and<br />he was trying to put it in from outside.
4898769 4901887 And the wind came up and caught it<br />and flipped him around
4902064 4904476 and just whipped it<br />right out of his hands.
4904650 4908018 And it was lunch hour,<br />the plaza was full of people.
4908195 4911608 And I looked at him and I thought,<br />"My God, somebody's dead."
4911782 4916447 "This huge shard of glass is going<br />to fall down." He didn't look concerned.
4916620 4923617 I looked out the window and this piece of<br />glass was falling, and it disintegrated into...
4923794 4928209 It's tempered glass and it breaks up into<br />tiny little pieces smaller than a dime
4928382 4930623 that don't weigh<br />anything and aren't sharp.
4930801 4936513 So this rain, widely scattered, fell down<br />on the plaza and nobody was aware of it.
4936849 4938931 I don't think that's a metaphor.
4940352 4945142 <i>JOHN:</i> Now, you see all these conversations?<br />They're separated by a telephone, or a radio.
4945315 4947932 Really, it's a conversation there.
4948152 4953864 As far as the audience is concerned, it<br />should look as if they're in the same room.
4954032 4959277 Well, you notice that Hans is<br />over to the left of McClane.
4959830 4966167 Now Bruce is about to turn around because...<br />Hart is on the other side of the screen,
4966336 4969624 so Bruce is about to turn around<br />to talk to him.
4977890 4980848 I've moved now Bruce<br />to the other side of the screen.
4981018 4987765 He's now facing the right side. That was the<br />way he was talking to Al Powell in the car.
4987941 4993232 The attempt was to give the audience some<br />sense of geography between different people.
4993405 4995772 Even though they were separated,
4995949 4999442 you had a sense that so-and-so was here,<br />somebody else was there.
4999620 5006617 We tried to keep a de facto consistency about<br />it, although it would continually change.
5006793 5013711 At any particular moment you had a physical<br />relationship to where various people were.
5013884 5017595 In a de facto sense, in a dramatic sense,<br />as far as the audience is concerned,
5017679 5021297 these people are in the same room,<br />so shoot it that way.
5083662 5088623 And also, obviously, I had to position<br />the spectators and things.
5088792 5091910 They're all looking in the same direction
5092087 5097708 in the direction opposed to where Hart<br />was looking just before Hart got shot.
5097884 5103470 If they weren't, we'd have trouble figuring out<br />what they were reacting to when they scream.
5120032 5125698 Here you see Reggie VelJohnson is facing<br />Bruce when you come into this scene.
5125871 5127908 We left Bruce looking to the right.
5128081 5132245 And now we come to these guys,<br />and they're looking to the left.
5148435 5154397 Good Lord, Paul is funny. Even watching him<br />silently, he's just hysterical to watch.
5194272 5197685 I did several versions of this shot,
5197859 5203104 with the blood a little bit more<br />in focus or a little less,
5204032 5209994 to try to get one that would let you know<br />what had happened clearly,
5210163 5214282 and yet, not gross you out.
5224386 5229631 This is actually all on a stage<br />and that's a lit background out there.
5229808 5231924 I had to keep it out of focus.
5232102 5236517 As soon as you let the camera focus<br />get deep enough
5236690 5239590 that the painting in the background<br />started to get focused,
5239735 5243478 you immediately knew what it was.<br />At least, I believe you did.
5243655 5246443 So I always kept it deep<br />out of focus like that,
5246616 5249904 which meant that I was usually<br />working with the wide-angle lenses.
5250078 5253665 The open end of the aperture, whether<br />I was using a long lens or a wide lens,
5253749 5255786 it was almost always wide open.
5255959 5258997 Photographic backgrounds are like that.
5259171 5261214 Great for commercials<br />and that sort of thing,
5261298 5266634 but they seldom will hold up for a movie -<br />where you can really look at them longer.
5266803 5270387 <i>JACKSON: I get more pleasure<br />out of telling people about Die Hard</i>
5270557 5275017 people who really love movies,<br />that don't think of <i>Die Hard</i> as a classic,
5275187 5282187 and people that have really high taste and<br />don't consider action movies to be "real".
5282402 5286145 I'm making air quotes,<br />folks: "real movies".
5286573 5288610 That happened this summer.
5288784 5291617 Someone who I really like<br />and respect on the film
5291787 5296623 was, like, all into <i>Ashes and Diamonds</i><br />and Polish films and stuff.
5296792 5299192 We were talking about what I had done<br />and I said,
5299336 5301953 "If you want to see a good movie,<br />see <i>Die Hard."</i>
5302130 5306044 Eventually she and her husband<br />sat down to watch it on tape,
5306218 5313218 and it was like... People have no idea<br />how solid this picture is, how good it is.
5314601 5317559 And it's because there is no cheating.
5317729 5322348 And more and more, I'm beginning<br />to believe that that is the secret.
5323985 5328775 You know, Stanislavsky analyzed<br />the character and the play
5329282 5332070 As having a spine, a through line, an arc.
5332244 5334326 I don't like "arc". "Arc" is modern.
5334496 5336612 It's not an arc, it's a freight train.
5336790 5342001 It's like with <i>Speed...</i> Unlike <i>Die Hard,</i><br />the script of <i>Speed</i> was complete.
5342170 5345834 All you had to do was make it.<br />You know, it was obvious. Zip.
5346258 5350297 You know, it's America.<br />All problems are solved by going faster.
5350470 5356136 This was a work in progress by a bunch of<br />geniuses that didn't know they were yet.
5356309 5362976 And it was just invented. I mean, it had a<br />great structure to begin with, had a great idea.
5363149 5366437 I think this was one of the first movies
5366778 5369489 That was, like, improvised<br />- in the best sense.
5369573 5375990 Because the best improvisation<br />is from the solid, rock-hard earth.
5376162 5383125 This is located in reality<br />and theatricality in just a delicious way.
5383295 5388665 One thing plays off another. The two spirits<br />of this movie are McTiernan and Silver
5388842 5392085 they just reinforced<br />each other in this period.
5395348 5398636 <i>JOHN:</i> I love these two guys,<br />Johnson and Johnson: "No relation."
5398810 5401051 And I changed the line.
5401229 5406144 It used to be that the white guy<br />walking up said, "No relation."
5406568 5411653 I found that offensive, so I switched it<br />around the other way, had the black guy say it
5411823 5416943 he was the one who wanted to make it clear<br />that he wasn't related to the thug next to him.
5417120 5419987 This actually is on<br />the roof of a building
5420165 5427165 all of these duct works<br />and ventilation machinery.
5430091 5434585 With a great deal of steam...<br />Jan de Bont was the cameraman.
5434763 5438973 We put steam in all over the place<br />just to keep it interesting.
5463917 5466625 I can never tell whether...
5466795 5469958 Other people seem to have<br />no difficulty with this, but
5470131 5473249 I still hear Alan<br />Rickman's English accent.
5473426 5477795 I was never quite happy with<br />the way he opened his mouth there.
5477973 5481136 I kept reworking it.
5481309 5483259 In fact, I think I shot it three times,
5483395 5489858 trying to get him to sound<br />more stridently American.
5490026 5494896 And this was the... It's odd for someone<br />who has such enormous verbal skills,
5495073 5499408 but he just had terrible trouble<br />getting an American accent.
5499577 5506449 One can now do so much more<br />with computers and voices.
5507293 5511161 I can have a double come in<br />and say a line the way I want it,
5511339 5516925 and then have a computer twist it into<br />the voice of whoever the real actor is.
5517095 5521760 Actually they just do it on regular Macintosh<br />computers sitting by the mixing stage.
5521933 5528179 It's so simple now. But you couldn't...<br />This was long ago in 1987.
5528356 5532725 It's astonishing how quickly all this<br />stuff has... technology has exploded.
5534404 5540241 <i>JACKSON:</i> People say that this is<br />mediocre architecture, and I don't agree.
5540410 5545200 I really grew to love the building because<br />it offered so many possibilities to us.
5545373 5552373 It's a very dramatic building, in that its angles<br />and its pointed prows and all that stuff...
5553173 5555915 It photographs well, really nice.
5557635 5559785 They're going to go<br />down the computer room.
5559971 5562713 We'll go into that <i>Caligari</i> Dutch angle.
5562891 5569058 I think it's because of the, uh... yet<br />another level of reality in those scenes.
5569230 5571972 But it's a deception.
5572150 5574608 <i>JOHN:</i> I loved twisting this scene.
5574778 5580899 Going for a slope in the camera gives it<br />instantly, all of a sudden, more feeling.
5581076 5582362 Here we go.
5582535 5587951 <i>JACKSON: A lot of this<br />lighting from below... [LAUGHS]</i>
5588124 5591583 <i>JOHN:</i> Steve De Souza<br />I have to give credit for this.
5591753 5595121 He insisted that it would be really neat
5595298 5600839 if we could get the two of them in one room<br />together and let them duel for a while.
5602555 5606469 We certainly never rehearsed this scene.<br />The two actors wouldn't know how to...
5606643 5609603 These two guys are such pros,<br />they probably know how to do it
5609687 5612487 if you walked in on the first day<br />of production and said,
5612607 5614814 "Here, we're going to shoot this scene."
5614984 5619319 Generally, I try to be nicer to actors<br />and give them a chance to work into it.
5619489 5620948 Maybe they'd have known how to do it,
5621032 5625993 but I wouldn't have known how to shoot it<br />on the first day of production.
5632293 5636082 <i>JACKSON:</i> Had to have a<br />directory there for that glance.
5638508 5642046 I think basically the<br />story is really satisfying
5642220 5646885 because it comes from the patterns<br />that we are born with,
5647058 5650642 that our culture is founded upon.
5650812 5655352 There are structures, just as there are<br />structures in our language, that underlie
5655525 5657516 that are built into all of this.
5657694 5660777 It's like artists don't<br />invent, they discover.
5660947 5664861 And they give you something that resonates<br />with something that's inside you,
5665034 5670074 and the closer they get to the real deal,<br />the real stuff, the gut-level stuff,
5670248 5677248 the longer it's gonna last because it remains<br />satisfying beyond fashion, beyond period.
5678256 5680591 <i>Die Hard</i> is not unique<br />in that it doesn't date.
5680675 5685841 I mean, Fred Astaire doesn't date.<br />John Ford doesn't date.
5686931 5691346 In time, this is going to look like<br />a wonderful period movie,
5691519 5696229 like those films that we loved<br />that we all grew up watching on TV.
5696399 5699858 It's not only of its time,<br />it's beyond its time.
5700028 5705865 It's in deep time. It's in that same old<br />story that's going on that we all share.
5734812 5740433 <i>JOHN:</i> Bruce is so good with... he's most<br />endearing when he's being a smart ass.
5742987 5744864 That's the essence of his stardom.
5744948 5749442 Somebody's pointing a gun right<br />between his eyes and he goes, "Oops."
5750036 5755531 That irreverence is what we seem<br />to love about him.
5756459 5758294 <i>JACKSON:</i> This is one of those things<br />where...
5758378 5761297 For a while we didn't know<br />what the set was gonna be used for,
5761381 5764965 but there it was and it was great,<br />so this ended up there.
5765134 5771301 The night before we shot it, Joel said we had<br />to get all these pieces of tempered glass.
5771474 5775843 It usually takes two or three days because<br />it has to be poured and all that stuff.
5776020 5778887 And he did it, got it together.
5780024 5782482 They didn't know<br />what was going to happen here.
5782652 5787192 I was spending all this money on the set<br />because it was in, it was out, it was in,
5787365 5789777 and what it was for, blah, blah, blah.
5789993 5795113 And when they walked on the set,<br />McTiernan and Silver had a conference
5795290 5797952 and then this is what happened.
5798167 5801831 And it's one of the great sequences.
5802755 5805463 <i>JOHN:</i> It's interesting<br />working in Montreal right now
5805633 5807624 where everyone says everything twice.
5807802 5810387 They say it in French<br />and then they say it in English.
5810471 5814806 They have to do it in that order - it's<br />legally mandated that it must be done that way.
5814976 5821313 But I think actually there are a lot of places<br />in the world where things are polylingual.
5821482 5824691 And people don't worry about it much<br />any more.
5824861 5827398 You can bounce from language to language.
5827572 5829949 <i>JACKSON:</i> There's something Silverian<br />about the glee
5830033 5832993 with which this whole thing is<br />completely wiped out. <i>[LAUGHS]</i>
5833077 5838368 We got all these computers, swearing that<br />nothing would happen to them, and then...
5838791 5841749 You're certainly not going to get<br />any dust in that room.
5841919 5844286 They were all real, you know.
5846549 5848586 It's great fun, though, to trash things.
5848760 5853175 Look at that.<br />I mean, what isn't going on in this room?
5853348 5857387 You know, that's what you want -<br />you want things to be used.
5880124 5885290 <i>JOHN:</i> That's George Christy,<br />the expert on Stockholm syndrome.
5885463 5889878 He's a columnist<br />for the trades in Los Angeles.
5893054 5896263 <i>JACKSON:</i> I have a lot of flashing lights<br />in this movie.
5915326 5920787 I love this moment. He smashes<br />the cart, she says, "He's alive"...
5921124 5926164 "Nobody else could..." What's the line?<br />"..piss somebody off that much."
5926337 5928669 Something like that.
5935346 5937431 <i>JOHN:</i> Bruce's acting has really<br />proceeded...
5937515 5939391 He's gotten better and better.
5939475 5943764 He's more and more willing<br />to show honest parts of himself.
5943938 5947556 I think in <i>The Sixth Sense</i><br />he was just extraordinary.
5947733 5950778 I don't know what's happened -<br />maybe getting divorced or something.
5950862 5955732 It's like a dam has broken in his life and<br />he's willing to be more and more honest.
5955908 5958195 <i>JACKSON:</i> I love these graphics. Whee!
5961330 5967292 <i>JOHN:</i> It's tricky to get a serious<br />character scene in a popcorn movie.
5967462 5970045 It took us quite a<br />while to find this scene.
5970214 5975050 I don't think we even got it written until we<br />were two-thirds of the way through shooting.
5975219 5978507 You want just enough in there<br />so that it makes things plausible,
5978681 5983676 but not so much that people think<br />you're being pretentious and silly.
5983853 5987437 I immediately followed it<br />with a comedy scene here.
5988357 5991349 For that matter, Shakespeare does it.
5991527 5995145 You put the Porter in the middle<br />of deciding you're going to kill Duncan,
5995323 5997573 and just before you go in<br />to commit the murder
5997658 6002243 you put the drunken doorkeeper in -<br />and that's who these guys are.
6003414 6006122 You know, they're the comedians.
6006292 6010126 This is an enormous character comedy,<br />if you will.
6010296 6013379 I mean, it's a Shakespearean comedy.
6013549 6018089 Mostly the cops are the comedians -<br />the cops and the FBI.
6019096 6025638 The comedy has to be just on the edge and<br />can never be about the center of the story.
6026938 6029930 The center of the story,<br />or the center of the conflict,
6030107 6035693 is between Bruce and<br />the people holding his wife.
6035863 6042656 And there's never any comedy or ridicule<br />associated with that aspect of the plot.
6042828 6046037 You can have the comedians<br />muck around on the edges,
6046207 6049495 but you can't make fun<br />of the center of the story.
6049669 6051660 And if you keep those straight,
6051837 6056206 it's astonishing what sort of broad things<br />you can get away with.
6056384 6061675 <i>JACKSON: I think that the story's superiority,<br />if you will, to, like, The Towering inferno</i>
6061847 6065761 is that everybody was<br />a totally cardboard symbol of...
6065935 6069599 There was the man who makes a mistake,<br />there was the man who was a faker,
6069772 6074608 there was the man who was ruthless,<br />the man who was responsible, the hero.
6074902 6077860 Here, all those roles are fulfilled.
6078030 6082615 But you're not aware of it. You're not<br />aware that they're standing for something.
6082785 6085948 They are, in the truest sense,
6086289 6090497 Types that are fulfilled because they're<br />organic to the story and the drama.
6090668 6095287 It's entirely satisfying.<br />There's no part of it that you skip over.
6096090 6100926 The vault itself had to project formidability<br />in a new way, so it was believable that...
6101095 6106511 I guess it's the key to the movie, in<br />the sense that you can't get in that vault
6106684 6111178 without getting somebody to do something<br />that requires a theatrical performance.
6111355 6116566 The whole thing is fake.<br />The FBI actually unlocks the vault.
6116736 6121151 It's a wonderful irony and<br />it's anything but straightforward
6121324 6123816 which is a forte of McTiernan.
6123993 6126405 But in order to work,
6126579 6131949 it had to look like you couldn't<br />get in that vault unless you did that.
6132126 6137121 There was something about the design that<br />I did, I wanted a completely smooth shape.
6137298 6142418 That cylinder, that semicircle, it<br />doesn't allow any purchase to the point
6142595 6146964 it's really hard to drill into something<br />that doesn't have an edge.
6147141 6150179 The surface goes in all directions.
6150353 6154312 Probably should've been a globe,<br />but that would've been awful.
6154482 6159022 And the door to the vault is angular,<br />like the prominences of the building
6159195 6163689 and the points of the Nakatomi<br />and all of that structure.
6163866 6166278 But see, that's not what opens the vault.
6166452 6169695 What opens the vault is wit.
6169872 6174833 I mean, you could expand that<br />into a metaphor for the action film,
6175002 6180372 in that in order to get people to feel<br />today, you gotta go through all this stuff.
6185721 6188008 <i>JOHN:</i> That was a special effect.
6188182 6191766 Turning the lights out on the building<br />was a major special effect.
6191936 6196225 It was physically not possible<br />to turn the lights out on the building
6196399 6199149 without clearing...<br />going to Sacramento to find someone…
6201112 6204114 Who would give permission to flip a switch<br />big enough to do that,
6204198 6207236 So that we had to do with optical effects.
6207410 6213747 And it probably cost us 20,000 dollars to make<br />the effect of turning the building lights off.
6214333 6217291 This is the sort of cash-in<br />on the "Ode to Joy".
6217461 6222422 We're not playing the soundtrack now, but I<br />think we do play it as the door opens there.
6222591 6227256 And the whole notion of<br />giving the villains a positive action,
6227430 6230047 something they actually wanted
6230224 6234559 they want the money, as opposed to<br />something mean or hateful
6234729 6237687 I think it allows us to like them.
6243195 6245687 <i>JACKSON:</i><br />So, I suppose you could take the safe...
6245865 6251235 The whole purpose of any drama<br />is to unlock the heart of the audience.
6251412 6253028 It's catharsis.
6253205 6256038 There's that fucking radar dish again.
6256959 6260702 And to allow people to feel,<br />because we're so smart.
6260880 6263167 We're too smart to have sympathy.
6263340 6266878 You have to fake people out<br />in order to allow to them to feel,
6267052 6271296 to make it OK for them<br />to have emotions in a work of art,
6271474 6275763 cos we're supposed to be, like, really<br />cool, and have been for a long time.
6275936 6282649 And there's just something about<br />the decency of Bonnie Bedelia
6282818 6286106 and Takagi, and the<br />hapless police lieutenant,
6286280 6289272 and Reginald VelJohnson, and the maid:
6289450 6294320 that even though you're rooting for John,<br />the Bruce Willis character,
6294497 6300709 and you love the fact that he's the<br />avenger, this is who he's the avenger of.
6300878 6304712 This is who he's standing for.<br />That's what a cop is supposed to be.
6304882 6308045 He's supposed to take care of people<br />that can't be violent,
6308219 6314716 against people who are, who kill without thinking<br />twice about it, or cheat or lie or steal.
6314892 6318681 And in that sense,<br />he's an extremely satisfying hero
6318854 6323769 in a way that is not seen much<br />in modern stories.
6325236 6328354 But in order to get there,<br />you have to blow up the building.
6328531 6330818 You have to have all this spectacle
6330991 6337991 to kind of overwhelm our resistance to belief<br />in the fact that when push comes to shove,
6338999 6343960 despite all the talk and the procrastination,<br />despite all our opinions and stuff,
6344129 6349215 we really mostly like other people<br />when we get a chance to see them.
6349802 6354922 And these characters in <i>Die Hard,</i><br />they're all innately sympathetic,
6355099 6358091 and the villain himself a wonderful rogue.
6358269 6362308 You know, he's the wonderful devil<br />because he's totally aware.
6362481 6365599 And that was a really neat trick.
6366277 6371022 I mean, he's a principal of evil,<br />but he is so damn much fun to watch
6371198 6375613 because we would all like to be like that,<br />but we're not allowed.
6375786 6381122 And there's a reason, because<br />we're capable of such awful things.
6381292 6384080 I think that's enough about the vault.
6468754 6474340 <i>JOHN:</i> This woman is actually Italian,<br />but she has to pretend to be Hispanic.
6509128 6512166 What you just saw was a jump cut,
6512339 6518210 which now people use all the time<br />in commercials and everything constantly.
6518387 6523097 But I had to fight like crazy<br />with the studio just to do a little...
6523267 6526180 Cos it was out of the<br />normal American mode.
6527646 6533187 European films had been doing it for quite a<br />while, but American films really hadn't much.
6533652 6540652 Some of them think that they have to express<br />a knowledge of the manufacturing process.
6540951 6543693 The more experienced ones<br />actually do have a knowledge
6543871 6546909 and are not insecure about<br />expressing their knowledge,
6547082 6550541 so they would never get involved<br />in something like that.
6550711 6555797 It's usually the young ones trying to<br />impress somebody that are trouble.
6557718 6560551 <i>JACKSON:</i> Always loved that gun.
6561138 6564221 It's just a great-looking weapon.
6565934 6568016 This is a Joe Picerni thing.
6568187 6573432 Getting a really, really good fight<br />in a limited space, in a real space.
6573776 6577815 It begins with a conversation between<br />the director and the stunt coordinator,
6577988 6583609 and what kind of props can you provide<br />that are active as well as reactive.
6584036 6589156 The effectiveness of that fight was a function<br />of the directing: how many times he hits him.
6589500 6593167 McClane hits good enough the first time.
6598884 6602093 <i>JOHN:</i> You have to use the older<br />Panavision lenses to get that.
6602262 6607257 The ones that most people use now... If<br />they use anamorphic, they use the Primos,
6607434 6614434 which won't flare like that<br />when a light is aimed down the barrel.
6617194 6619652 So you have to use the older ones.
6625828 6628069 <i>JACKSON:</i> Great suit.
6629248 6632582 Very Fred Astaire, that move,<br />I always thought.
6641593 6644051 There may be a few<br />ideas that we contributed.
6644221 6649466 I think I contributed the idea of the<br />stairway, the chain block and strangling him.
6649643 6654183 I believe I recall... But, you know,<br />in the set, in the physical environment,
6654356 6658224 sometimes you find things that you think<br />might be groovy that would work.
6658402 6659688 That was such a case.
6659862 6665107 All sorts of people contribute individual<br />ideas, but the whole shape of everything
6665284 6668618 is something that's between<br />the director and the coordinator.
6669746 6673330 <i>JOHN:</i> We shot the helicopters here<br />all on one Sunday morning.
6673500 6679086 Every person within 500 feet of the<br />line off light had to be an employee.
6679256 6685878 And we did it all in two hours on a Sunday<br />night after six months of preparation.
6686054 6691220 The helicopters made three runs,<br />and I think I had about nine camera crews.
6691393 6694511 Each camera crew had a shot to do<br />on the first run
6694688 6698022 and then had to go to their second area,<br />and then go with it.
6698192 6701981 If they accomplished their first<br />two shots, they had a third shot
6702154 6703770 that they were supposed to get.
6703947 6707531 I suppose if you were really<br />a freak about organization,
6707701 6712571 you could do a whole movie almost<br />in real time if you had enough cameras
6712748 6717834 and enough planning on what the cameramen<br />were supposed to photograph.
6721673 6726634 <i>JACKSON:</i> He had to be careful to take...<br />You know, it's not about whose idea it was.
6726803 6730546 It's about... when it<br />gets rolling like this,
6730724 6734843 and this movie was rolling longer<br />than any other I've been on,
6735020 6741517 it's coming from every direction because<br />everybody's into it, all making it work.
6755916 6760001 <i>JOHN:</i> I love this little moment<br />that he pulls off.
6760671 6765837 "I'm an excellent thief, and since I'm moving<br />up to kidnapping..." It took a little while.
6766009 6770094 At first, he was playing it as a<br />regular... He was staying over there,
6770264 6776681 and then I got this notion about, "Come<br />on, assault her - you know, be scary."
6777271 6780764 And he found this way to throw the case
6780941 6785651 and suddenly get his<br />face right in her face.
6787406 6789989 And it made it work, though.
6828530 6830487 <i>JACKSON:</i> A great scene.
6830657 6832898 These guys are so scary.
6833535 6837449 <i>JOHN:</i> I love this. I made up this line.<br />This is my line.
6837622 6840831 "I was in junior high,<br />jackass," or whatever.
6847924 6852464 <i>JACKSON:</i> The FBI guys, they're cowboys.<br />I mean, they're just like the terrorists.
6852637 6855220 They have no concern for<br />the safety of civilians
6856308 6862020 losing 20 percent, 30 percent, is acceptable.<br />At least they end up looking good.
6862189 6865853 The collateral damage<br />was really an issue here.
6869029 6871111 <i>JOHN:</i> This actually is the roof.
6871281 6874273 We really did have all<br />these actors up there.
6874451 6876488 It was after the <i>Twilight Zone</i> accident.
6876661 6880081 I stood there on the roof of that building<br />after six months of planning
6880165 6883328 and hundreds of dry meetings<br />and this and that.
6883502 6888793 And this Vietnam-era chopper<br />climbed up over 100 people
6888965 6890965 on the little tiny top of this building,
6891093 6894302 and I said, "Oh, I am in deep shit."
6894971 6898509 I couldn't believe I had<br />gotten myself so near to...
6898683 6903723 I mean, all that had to happen was, you<br />know, a pilot makes a mistake or something...
6903897 6906514 Just there.
6906691 6909058 I called them off on<br />the succeeding two runs.
6909236 6912774 I just didn't have the nerve to have it<br />out there over those people.
6912948 6917248 I said, "Just come up the side of the building<br />and don't go over the top of the crowd,"
6917369 6919861 cos it just physically scared me.
6921331 6924331 I couldn't figure a better way<br />to do that thing with Godunov,
6924418 6928503 other than having the unnecessary cut<br />of him hanging there
6928672 6934042 as a little suggestion that we haven't<br />heard the last of this particular issue.
6934219 6936927 If he wasn't there when<br />they were coming down...
6937097 6941887 It was a problem I wrestled with - how do<br />you say he's dead, he's never coming back,
6942060 6944802 but do it in a way that<br />when he does come back,
6944980 6947563 the audience says,<br />"Oh, I knew it. I saw it"?
6947732 6950349 Sometimes you get that right<br />and sometimes you don't.
6950527 6955897 <i>JACKSON:</i> The figuring out of the fire hose<br />gag and stuff took many stages
6956074 6960819 how it worked and how the reel would work<br />and all that stuff. That was fun.
6960996 6964489 Cos this has to be believable -<br />that he can actually do this.
6964666 6967283 It's a crazy-ass thing<br />to do, but, you know,
6967461 6973878 there's a real line that you draw<br />between the absurd and the believable.
6974050 6979341 So we were trying to make it something<br />that would actually be.
6987814 6993480 You know, I actually had a camera way out<br />on a hillside five miles from the building.
7028939 7034685 This was all thought of in pieces -<br />pushing it as far as you possibly could.
7052254 7054461 We are in the jungle.
7055924 7059007 We're coming up to my favorite moment.
7062847 7065635 All of the bad things that can happen...
7066268 7070887 All right, so you go through all this -<br />you know, you swing in the fire,
7071064 7077401 you almost get dragged out the window, the<br />fucking helicopter crashes into the atrium...
7079698 7084443 Just when you think the worst<br />possible thing has happened...
7086037 7088870 Bing! Bloing!
7089040 7093580 It's the little light coming on<br />before the elevator explodes, you know?
7093753 7095790 I love that.
7116443 7118901 Now, look at that. Unbelievable.
7119904 7122396 That's the one real cheat.
7161613 7167700 <i>JOHN:</i> There's a misspelling on the side<br />of the ambulance that none of us saw.
7203238 7207778 Now, Bruce came up with this line:<br />"Hi, honey."
7209619 7211155 <i>Hi, honey.</i>
7211329 7215539 I was terrified building this scene,<br />cos it's such a cliché.
7216626 7223373 The villain holding the gun<br />to the head of the hero's love interest.
7225218 7230088 Literally, I've seen it 50 or 60<br />times now - hundreds of times.
7231307 7233514 I think we got away with it all right.
7233685 7238179 What I did was sort of try to acknowledge<br />the cliché-ness of it,
7238356 7243647 and then twist it up.<br />"Oh, it comes out backwards," you know?
7243820 7249611 And this thing here of adding the business<br />of Holly understanding what he's gonna do,
7249784 7253652 sensing it, and making the break<br />at the right moment...
7343127 7345459 <i>JACKSON:</i> He's above a greenscreen now.
7345630 7350249 <i>JOHN:</i> Alan actually dropped nearly 70 feet<br />into an airbag to get this shot,
7350426 7353009 and I hung him on the roof of a big stage.
7353179 7357264 The only way you can get that look<br />on a face is when gravity disappears.
7357433 7360516 <i>JACKSON:</i> This is the first time<br />they dropped him.
7360687 7362974 He's really scared to death.
7363147 7364603 Isn't that great?
7364774 7369143 <i>JOHN:</i> And so what was really below him,<br />seven floors down, was an airbag.
7369320 7371186 And he really is falling.
7371364 7374857 I had to go do it first, though,<br />to talk him into it.
7376202 7378614 The body falling down<br />the side of the buildings,
7378788 7383453 if you'd actually seen it get to<br />the ground, it would've looked silly,
7383626 7387790 because it was a real person on a Descender,<br />which is a cable that slows them down.
7387964 7390126 You actually can't see them land.
7390300 7394715 And Reggie got me through the problem<br />of how do you see them land
7394888 7397346 by closing his eyes and squinting there.
7397515 7401850 So it was perfectly plausible<br />to cut away from the non landing
7402020 7405604 and cut to the people<br />who didn't want to look at it.
7405773 7409812 <i>JACKSON:</i> This was great fun<br />to do this in Fox Plaza.
7409986 7412478 We did it over a weekend, one night.
7412655 7415192 We built platforms<br />underneath the piles of rubble
7415366 7417733 and then dressed lightweight stuff in
7417911 7422496 timber, Styrofoam,<br />what was left over of the helicopter.
7422665 7426704 That's one of my favorite things,<br />that paper falling.
7428379 7433173 The boys were up on the tenth floor<br />balconies, throwing the stuff off.
7433343 7438429 <i>JOHN:</i> And here's a wonderful thing that<br />Jack came up with, the snowing paper.
7438598 7442091 It made it look like there was<br />so much destruction in the building,
7442268 7446102 when actually, we had it all cleaned up<br />by Monday morning.
7446272 7448354 <i>JACKSON:</i> It's corporate records.
7448524 7452518 In one version of the script, it was the<br />money, which is too much on the nose.
7452695 7456859 But it's the records.<br />It's the soul of the corporation.
7457033 7460992 And it's the Christmas season,<br />and it's snow, and it's gleeful.
7461621 7465831 It's like Mardi Gras. There's so<br />many levels. Ticker-tape parades...
7466000 7471962 You're always called upon to do a<br />happytime - symbols for a happy ending.
7472131 7474213 But there's a layer of irony on it.
7474384 7476500 It's great.
7477387 7483099 And office workers came to work the next<br />morning, and the plaza looked like this.
7486354 7491474 <i>JOHN:</i> When I finish a movie, I don't<br />look at it usually for... usually years.
7491651 7495269 Just because I can't look at it<br />without seeing all the mistakes I made,
7495446 7499610 and all the things I'm still<br />obsessed about, trying to fix.
7499784 7503778 It gives me a terrible sense of failure<br />if I look at a movie immediately,
7503955 7506663 but at a certain point<br />you kind of forgive.
7506833 7512294 And it becomes what it is, rather than<br />what you intended, what you hoped for.
7513715 7517754 And I don't know, I guess this movie<br />has come to that point. <i>[LAUGHS]</i>
7517927 7521386 I'm not squirming when I watch it.
7524642 7527134 OK, here he is back from the dead.
7528980 7531972 It's so great that Bruce<br />Willis didn't kill him.
7534235 7537102 We had the original... We had the score,
7537280 7542446 and it didn't accomplish what<br />we were looking for, so I guess we...
7544120 7547247 I'd forgotten we bought a couple of pieces<br />of music right at the end,
7547331 7549823 on the last day of the mix.
7550001 7555542 I said, "Wait a minute, the temporary<br />music is more effective here."
7577153 7581863 I gave Holly the chance to, you know,<br />not just be the baggage.
7582033 7584866 She has to at least get<br />even with the reporter.
7585036 7587323 It's become a cliché now that
7587663 7589623 Reporters are not necessarily nice people.
7589707 7592540 But it's astonishing,
7592710 7597580 then some reviewers just excoriated us<br />because we were making fun of the press.
7598883 7605425 One particular guy, I think he's still working<br />in Los Angeles, was so personally offended.
7605598 7607760 And now you see the dawn coming here,
7607934 7611347 which is the end of the<br /><i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>
7611854 7616189 I'm using a really<br />clichéd, drive-away shot
7616359 7622025 seeing the two of them kiss through the rear<br />window of the car and that kind of stuff.
7627620 7630578 <i>JACKSON:</i> We were all<br />really lucky to work on it.
7630748 7634537 It's not something you deserve.<br />It's something that happens to you.
7634710 7637998 And it was great that<br />we were all up to it.
7638840 7641633 I'm really glad that I got a chance<br />to do this picture.
7641717 7644926 I'm really glad that Joel<br />let me do this picture,
7645096 7649385 and I'm really glad that<br />McTiernan accepted me.
7649559 7652972 And Jan was so great, and everybody<br />who worked on it was so great.
7653146 7656059 I keep coming back to that,<br />over and over again.
7656232 7661978 It just was this magical time when<br />everybody was at the top of their game.
7662155 7667241 You know, we all more or less had done<br />better and worse things in our careers.
7667410 7671449 But at this particular moment,<br />we were all, like, cooking
7671622 7674364 like a great jazz session or something.
7674542 7677211 Like when you get a group<br />of really good musicians together
7677295 7679878 and they produce something from the ages.
7680047 7683085 That's what this was like -<br />a great jam session.
7683259 7687548 Maybe movies today have to be like that,<br />because of the way they're made.
7687722 7690589 There's no tradition of anything any more.
7690766 7696227 We're all freelance people, like<br />jazz musicians or any kind of gypsies.
7696397 7699264 And, you know,<br />you get the right bunch together...
7699442 7706155 Somebody once said - I think it was David<br />Mamet - that producers really cast the movie.
7706324 7710067 They cast, not the actors,<br />but they cast everybody else.
7710244 7712576 And that's a great trick.
7712747 7716786 And Joel did that this<br />time really, really well
7717543 7722413 because he was largely responsible<br />for most of these people.
7722590 7726504 And John, of course, and the way<br />he picked the people that he picked...
7726677 7729465 And, you know, Joel picked John.
7729639 7732722 And I don't think that any of us
7732892 7738683 have ever been as fortunate to get on<br />something that just operated this way.
7738856 7742599 It's a great piece of music,<br />it really is - big band jazz.
7742777 7744814 Really good.
7745238 7748949 <i>JOHN:</i> I wasn't making it up - when I finish<br />a movie, for the first several years after,
7749033 7753118 I really can't watch it because it<br />makes me... All of the places I failed,
7753287 7757406 all of the places where I had hoped for<br />something or other and didn't achieve it,
7757583 7761201 are just sitting there<br />on the top of my mind.
7761379 7765498 And the movie becomes a check list<br />of the ways I screwed up.
7766676 7771170 I don't really... I suppose I don't have<br />the greatest self-image in the world,
7771347 7775557 but it's not rare for filmmakers<br />to react that way.
7775726 7781813 Kubrick used to say if he went out<br />and came back with 40 or 50 percent
7781983 7786147 of what he intended,<br />he was doing magnificently for the day.
7786320 7792441 That's the process of becoming a filmmaker<br />- getting past the humiliation of
7792618 7796452 the comparison between what you had<br />in mind and what you managed to shoot.
7796622 7798999 Eventually,<br />you get the percentage a little better.
7799083 7801996 Maybe an audience sees 25 or 30 percent
7802169 7806333 of what you intended<br />when you went out to shoot the story.
7806507 7812719 And I suppose old masters in Zen phase<br />like Truffaut or something,
7812888 7816131 maybe they get 75 percent. I don't know.
7816309 7821930 It's entirely impossible for a filmmaker<br />to be objective about a movie.
7822106 7826816 If you get far enough away from it...<br />No, even then you're not objective
7828154 7830896 you remember the good times<br />and the fun things,
7831073 7836489 and probably the various things you had to<br />talk about to the press, and this and that,
7836662 7841031 have all transmuted themselves<br />in your memory, and they've become real,
7841208 7847250 instead of nonsense that you made up<br />to get through an interview or something.
7847423 7852759 They become real events and real bon mots<br />that someone had at a particular moment.
7852928 7855545 And actually, they don't quite train you,
7855723 7860593 but they want you to go and make up<br />a bunch of stuff to say about a movie
7862480 7864730 cos now you have to<br />go do press all the time.
7864857 7869977 I watch these actors, like,<br />practicing their anecdotes.
7870154 7874113 They work on all these things that they're<br />going to say on <i>Letterman</i> and things.
7874283 7879449 They work out these little<br />three to five minute stories.
7879622 7883536 They haven't finished the movie,<br />and they're working on the stories.
7883709 7887498 It's quite astonishing<br />to watch these kids.
7887671 7889787 They know what's important.
7889965 7893959 They'll spend more time rehearsing the<br />anecdotes than they will the performance
7894136 7896468 or thinking about a scene.
7896639 7899722 And I suppose I'm a<br />famously bad interview.
7901018 7903851 Somebody gets the tape on,<br />and I'll sit there saying...
7904021 7907730 If they say, "Are there any<br />particular things that you want to say?"
7907900 7912565 "No, not really. I'm sort of happy<br />it's over, and I'm glad you liked it,
7912738 7915856 and now I'm working on this other thing."
7919161 7923155 -I'm a terrible interview.<br /><i>-[BOTH LAUGH]</i>
