23357 25817 <i>[RICHARD EDLUND]</i><br />Boss Film's reputation in those days
25901 31112 was based on the fact that<br />we shot all of our plates in 65mm.
31281 37903 We made really high quality anamorphic<br />composites from the 65, the large image,
38080 42290 so we had a big, large negative<br />which would then be duped
42459 46418 onto a 35mm squeezed anamorphic print.
46588 48920 Anamorphic, just so you understand,
49091 53130 it's like whenever you see<br />the old western movies with John Wayne,
53303 57718 riding off into the sunset, except he looks<br />like a toothpick, and his horse is skinny.
57891 64388 That's because it's been unsqueezed<br />so that you could read all the titles.
64565 67899 I mean, everybody's seen<br />that from time to time.
68068 72983 But the bulk of the movies that we did at<br />Boss Film until the last couple of years
73156 75147 were all anamorphic pictures,
75325 79614 and that was sort of the way<br />God had meant movies to be made.
79788 83156 And so, since we had this large format,<br />and we had this collection
83333 87327 which was the world's biggest collection<br />of 65mm equipment,
87504 93375 and optical printers, and rotoscope cameras,<br />and animation and motion control gear...
93552 97716 I mean, we had, like, 30...<br />at least 30 or 35 cameras
97889 101302 that were all 65mm<br />cameras of different types.
101476 105936 And so we could, by using<br />that large format in the process,
106106 109189 get higher quality than<br />anybody else could.
110569 113106 And that kind of equipment is rare,
113280 116944 and so we made our move on it<br />and collected as much as we could.
117117 121111 We actually built cameras<br />and built optical printers from scratch.
122789 125577 That's all made in the composite,<br />part of the process.
125751 129369 In other words, all of the elements<br />are carried in the projectors,
129546 133130 and the camera is<br />photographing it anamorphically.
133300 136258 So it had a special<br />lens that we had built.
136428 139295 It was about $80,000 for the lens.
139848 141843 For just the reduction lens.
142184 145597 A zoom lens on the printer,<br />that was even more than that.
146730 150394 Trumbull used to do that.
150567 153434 See, I inherited some of<br />that equipment from Doug,
153612 157105 and he got out of the business<br />and I took over the studio.
157282 163119 He would do that. He would composite,<br />and then double-dupe it down to 35,
163288 165325 which I never believed in.
167000 169037 I mean, why would you do that?
169211 172249 So our composites...<br />In fact, in <i>Ghostbusters,</i>
173090 178085 our composites looked better than the<br />original photography, and we had to degrade.
178261 180719 And the same case in <i>2010.</i>
181431 183968 The original was shot<br />with kind of a grainy...
184142 189637 I forget. It was 5293 or something like that<br />in those days, and it was kind of grainy.
189815 193149 And then when you cut to<br />one of those deep space shots,
193318 198279 it was like all of a sudden you were out<br />on the back porch, breathing fresh air.
199157 205073 It had a great relief from the claustrophobic<br />aspect of the stuff inside the ship, the action.
205247 209411 But in any case, 65<br />was our stock in trade,
209584 214704 and I think that we did some of the highest<br />quality optical work that was ever done.
214881 217248 I'm sure of it.
217426 224426 Because we built the finest equipment in<br />the photochemical world that you could have.
225809 228221 Just as when Technicolor,
228395 232354 which had this incredible<br />color process in the '30s and '40s,
232524 238236 all of a sudden Kodak came out with<br />monopack Eastmancolor, which was one film,
239030 241692 about in 1950, '51, that area.
242367 245109 Technicolor was obsolete overnight.
245287 249622 Nobody shot a Technicolor movie<br />with three-strip cameras after that,
249791 252579 even though the process was not as good.
253211 256920 The really early Eastmancolor<br />wasn't as good as Technicolor,
257090 261709 and it took them probably ten years<br />to equal the Technicolor look.
262345 268512 But it was so much cheaper and so much more<br />facile to make movies, it was worth it.
268685 270892 Plus it was cheaper.
271062 276307 It was the... To the purists, it was<br />the "Let them eat cake" kind of approach.
313438 315475 That's a whole other area.
315649 319142 I'm a real fan of digital film projection.
319736 322569 I think that's a whole different subject.
323532 328026 When I saw a 50-foot wide image<br />projected at the Directors Guild
328203 334495 from a 1280 x 1024 chip, the Micromirror,
335001 338414 unbelievable! I mean, it was...
338588 342081 I didn't expect much,<br />because it was only 1280 x 1024,
342259 346048 and I thought, "We do everything<br />at 2K, and I wish it was higher."
346221 350180 But when I saw it on the screen,<br />and I was at about one screen height,
350350 353638 one and a half screen heights<br />from the picture,
353812 355428 it was stunning.
355605 357972 And there were greys...
358149 363440 The blacks fell off too fast, and there were<br />little things about it that weren't there yet,
363613 365900 but it was so close.
366074 370238 But the thing is you're trading<br />from one artifact for another.
370579 375198 If you're projecting a digital image and you're<br />in the front row, you're gonna see pixels.
375375 379289 If you're projecting a film image<br />and you're in the front row,
379462 383080 you're gonna see golf balls<br />and softballs of grain.
383717 387881 So, I mean, you're just trading<br />one artifact from the other.
388054 391797 But what you get out of it<br />is this rock-steady picture.
391975 396640 And because you get<br />almost full pixel area,
396813 401603 it has a great apparent resolution<br />that makes it look really good.
401776 405815 And Connie Hall, who is one<br />of our great cinematographers,
407073 412284 because one of the elements of the test<br />that I saw was <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer.</i>
412454 416072 They also had <i>Grease</i> and <i>The Godfather,</i><br />and some animated movie,
416249 420709 and other movies like that that had been<br />transferred, so you could see a dark movie,
420879 425715 <i>The Godfather, Grease,</i> a lot<br />of stuff right out in the sunlight,
425884 432722 and <i>Bobby Fischer,</i> which was this beautiful<br />Conrad Hall masterpiece of photography.
434017 439012 And he preferred the digital<br />version of the movie to film, Connie did.
440690 446527 And that'll come. We're in the digital world,<br />and the digital world will enable upgrades.
447030 452366 With film... The film perforations<br />that are in the camera today
452535 455653 were designed by Alfred Howell in 1910.
455830 457946 So I have Bell & Howell cameras...
458208 461542 I have George Eastman's camera,<br />Bell & Howell camera 2709.
462128 467999 That camera can still be used<br />for standard photography today.
468843 471335 And it's steadier than<br />most cameras, anyway.
471680 475423 We have this ancient standard with film.<br />But we're stuck with it.
475600 479389 It's this kind of blacksmith shop.<br />That's my metaphor.
479562 484523 It's like we went from blacksmiths<br />to become neurosurgeons,
484693 487151 because all of a sudden we can...
799716 802504 The reason we can do anything<br />at all in special effects
802677 806591 is because we're dealing with<br />24 still images per second.
806764 809131 And because each one<br />of those images is still,
809309 812176 you can then look at it and manipulate it.
812353 817348 You can then perform visual magic<br />by modifying those images.
817525 822361 In the digital world, however, not only<br />do you get 12 or 24 or hopefully more,
822530 825363 hopefully up to 72 frames a second,
825533 828195 so you get a much more fluid image.
828369 833114 Not only can you because you're using it<br />for assistance vision, but I mean...
835335 839579 You're not only isolating<br />phases of motion,
839756 843545 but you also have pixel addressability
843885 846092 of every pixel in every frame.
846262 850381 So you really now have<br />this godlike capability
850558 854472 to really manipulate<br />and do incredible things.
855521 859071 The thing that knocked me out the most<br />in the last couple of years is...
860860 864603 Not that I loved the film so much,<br />but <i>Stuart Little.</i>
865448 869692 It was so charming,<br />and it was so realistic-looking.
871579 874241 And not only couldn't you<br />have done it before,
874415 877578 the funny thing is, I remember<br />after I did <i>Star Wars,</i>
877752 881211 I would be asked by<br />reporters or interviewers,
881381 884214 "Now you've done <i>Star Wars,</i><br />what else is there to do?"
884384 886625 And it's like, "Duh."
886803 890762 It's like, there's only<br />infinity out there, you know?
890932 895426 But there are all these holy grails<br />that you have to find along the way.
895603 898891 And one of them of course is hair,<br />in dealing with that kind...
899065 903605 And I haven't seen it done<br />any better than <i>Stuart Little.</i>
1019852 1023390 It was a different kind<br />of ingenuity that was required.
1023564 1025771 If you forget that digital is imminent
1025942 1029560 and you're living with those tools<br />in your toolbox and that's it,
1029737 1032980 and you have to,<br />with those tools, make it work,
1033157 1037526 and knowing the audience is constantly<br />saying, "Gimme more, gimme more."
1037703 1040946 As they're saying that<br />they're becoming more sophisticated
1041123 1046869 to seams and problems<br />that they used to overlook.
1047046 1049333 Thinking back to <i>King Kong,</i> for example.
1049507 1053296 If you go back and look at <i>King Kong,</i><br />it's really primitive.
1053469 1058464 I mean, the animation is stuttery, his fur<br />is moving around on his back all the time,
1058641 1060632 because it's shot frame by frame
1060810 1067648 and you have to grab him to manipulate the<br />stop-motion puppet from frame to frame.
1067817 1070275 But in those days,
1070444 1075735 it was so outrageous to anybody who hadn't<br />seen anything like that at all to watch that.
1075908 1080823 You know, it played. I remember going and<br />seeing <i>The Robe,</i> with Victor Mature, right?
1081122 1084865 And he's up on top of the mount,<br />and he's got this robe on,
1085042 1088580 but he's surrounded by<br />this kind of green halo.
1088754 1091166 And I thought, "What the hell is that?"
1091340 1092922 I was about...
1093092 1098838 This was in '51 or '52 or something like that.<br />I saw it in Minneapolis when I was a kid.
1099015 1103976 And that was my first memory of a<br />weird effect anomaly that stuck with me.
1104145 1108139 But at the same time,<br />even if you look at a movie like...
1110693 1112900 Well, if you look at <i>King Kong</i> today,
1113070 1116779 after a bit you kind of give it that air,
1116949 1119236 because the movie kind of works.
1119410 1122323 My wife can't watch it<br />because she's an animal lover
1122496 1127241 and she breaks down in tears<br />when King Kong falls to the...
1128294 1130331 So, I mean, it still works.
1130504 1133667 Even <i>Star Wars,</i> which<br />was my first big project
1133841 1137835 that we started in 1975,<br />that was 25 years ago.
1138012 1143223 When I saw that, even before it had<br />been nuanced and fixed up here and there,
1144644 1149434 it's pretty raggedy, you know what I mean?<br />From today's standards.
1149607 1152975 But as a movie it works,<br />because it was a good movie,
1153152 1155359 and so you let that stuff go.
1261969 1266338 With a fantasy show, the audience<br />actually wants you to take license,
1266515 1270804 and therefore in those cases the<br />balance is, how much license do you take?
1270978 1275939 If you take <i>Star Wars</i> as the ultimate example,<br />everybody's walking around on spaceships
1276108 1280568 and there's no concern about no gravity<br />in outer space and things like that.
1280738 1286233 And because there were hundreds of shots,<br />we had to put fill light on the ships
1286410 1292281 because otherwise there would be technical<br />problems with blue light spilling on it.
1292458 1297794 So the look of the show was dictated to some<br />degree by the technology that was available
1297963 1302753 and the amount of work that had to be<br />done within a finite period of time.
1303803 1306545 But in any case, in a movie like that
1306722 1312058 you can have spaceships that are<br />supposedly traveling at light speeds
1312228 1315471 look more like biplanes in World War I
1315648 1319357 in terms of their space, in terms of<br />their speed and their maneuverability.
1320277 1322439 If you've ever been in a jet,
1322613 1326151 by the time you do something,<br />you're five miles away.
1326325 1332822 So you can't get any good, dynamic shots<br />with jet planes because they move too fast.
1333457 1337451 So you take those licenses,<br />and in the case of <i>Die Hard,</i>
1337628 1342418 which was not an effects film at all,<br />it was a suspense movie.
1342591 1344832 So the effects had to serve that end,
1345010 1348002 and look absolutely<br />believable to the audience.
1348180 1352595 And if you betray that believability,<br />the audience is out of the movie
1352768 1355601 and they're saying,<br />"Hey, that shot looks funny."
1355771 1360766 You can't have that. That's the responsibility<br />you have in a reality show like that.
1360943 1362493 It's a lot more difficult to do
1362736 1365148 that kind of thing than<br />it is the fantasy part.
1365322 1369737 It has to look real, and it's more difficult<br />to get an absolutely realistic thing
1369910 1373824 than it is to get<br />a fanciful, groovy-looking thing.
4379792 4385162 When the armored car crashes, we put<br />some explosion enhancement behind it.
4385339 4391176 And this movie, of course, was done in<br />the Paleolithic age, the pre-digital.
4391345 4394633 So it was all done<br />photochemically with mattes
4394807 4399517 and animated on cel and<br />photograph rotoscoping techniques.
4400980 4404939 In order to put the explosion<br />behind something,
4405109 4408529 you had to make a matte of whatever<br />you had to put it behind, frame by frame.
4408613 4414450 Because the camera's always moving. Jan<br />de Bont doesn't like locked off cameras.
4414911 4417369 And of course neither does McTiernan.
4417538 4421998 And it was a nonstop movie,<br />it was constantly something going on,
4422168 4427629 here, there, up in the air, down on the<br />street, in the hostage area, all this stuff.
4427965 4430798 So there was a lot of<br />parallel tension going on.
4431469 4436009 We did motion-control to match to,<br />which we'll get into later.
4520558 4524847 The first big shot was dropping<br />the bomb down the elevator shaft.
4525021 4528855 And in this movie, either<br />the shot looked real or it didn't,
4529025 4531983 and that was kind of like<br />the criterion for all the work.
4532153 4537364 So if the shot didn't look real,<br />then it had to be nuanced until it did.
4537700 4542490 But in the case of the elevator shaft, we<br />built a forced perspective elevator shaft
4542663 4547408 which actually started small and<br />got big, as opposed to the other way,
4547585 4550703 so that we could shoot it on our stage.
4550880 4553338 We could only get the<br />camera about 20 feet.
4553507 4557171 And then, of course, Thaine came up<br />with a good fireball for that,
4557344 4560211 and so it was shot actually with a...
4560765 4564759 We actually changed camera speed<br />as the explosion came towards us,
4564935 4569054 so it became less over-cranked<br />in order to get the effect.
4569231 4573065 We wanted the effect of<br />reality in terms of scale,
4573235 4576353 but we also wanted dynamics<br />in terms of effects,
4576530 4578988 so we had to balance those carefully.
4579158 4584403 Then we matted Bruce, the back of<br />his head and his shoulder, into the shot,
4584580 4588448 then he jumped out, then of course<br />that intercut with the live explosion
4588626 4590913 that Al Di Sarro did on the set.
4591087 4595251 Because the most difficult shot<br />was the blowing up of the third floor.
4598260 4602549 We had this 30-million-dollar building,<br />or however many millions it was.
4603766 4610766 We couldn't blow the third floor out,<br />even though Joel tried to work that out.
4611398 4614607 But we couldn't actually<br />blow windows out and put cam
4614777 4617895 because the whole window was<br />a hermetically sealed chamber.
4618072 4622862 Those buildings are<br />like biospheres, in a sense.
4623369 4625576 So we had to, in order to do that,
4625746 4631207 we had to build a black armature<br />that was the exact shape of the building,
4631836 4634077 line it up to the building.
4634255 4639216 It had to be done in 35 anamorphic because<br />we had to use the high-speed camera to do it,
4639385 4643128 because we were working on...<br />I think that might have been a 14th scale,
4643305 4646673 or 12th scale, or 16th,<br />or something like that scale.
4647518 4650385 All these different shots<br />were on different scales,
4650563 4653851 depending on how big the miniature was.
4654024 4659440 We had this armature, set it up with<br />the camera, and then had to shoot...
4661115 4665279 The armature was actually<br />built like little mortars,
4665452 4668786 so these mortars of fire would shoot out
4668956 4671414 as though the whole building<br />were blowing out.
4671584 4674497 And even though that shot<br />lasted only about...
4674670 4680461 I'd be surprised if it was 30 frames. It might<br />have been 26 frames, something like that.
4682553 4685136 But I remember a long time ago
4685306 4690016 reading Raymond Spottiswoode's book<br /><i>A Grammar of the Film.</i>
4690186 4694054 He was saying that it only took<br />the human eye a fifth of a second
4694231 4696814 to register a change in shot,
4696984 4701854 cos he was intellectualizing the cinema<br />before he touched a foot of film.
4702031 4704318 He was the Russian cinema editor.
4704491 4708450 But anyway, I think that<br />fifth of a second has shrunk down
4708621 4713536 to where somebody could see rats<br />superimposed in the commercial,
4713709 4718920 like they did the other day.<br />Did you hear about that? Somehow...
4719089 4723424 The Republicans say that<br />it was a mistake, and I believe it was,
4723594 4728634 because I did read that in<br />the studio monitor you could see the "c."
4729350 4736268 Because they had bureaucrats, and somehow<br />that frame got burned into the thing.
4736440 4741310 So the Democrats were all saying<br />it was a subliminal, nasty message.
4741779 4747491 But somebody would pick that up, a 25th<br />of a sec or a 30th of a second in video.
4748327 4750819 So the bottom line is,
4750996 4755206 it doesn't take the human eye very long to<br />register whether something works or not.
4756502 4759790 So that shot turned out to be<br />the most difficult shot to do.
4759964 4764424 We did it over and over again,<br />trying to get the glass to look right,
4764593 4768211 and the smoke would go behind a matte,
4768389 4775307 and it was all these little complex<br />layering problems that had to be worked out.
4776272 4781642 I think we used hundreds of these FF31<br />flashbulbs which I discovered on <i>Raiders,</i>
4782695 4787815 and what they were were big flashbulbs<br />that look like about a 150-watt bulb,
4788659 4791321 and they last about two seconds.
4791495 4795489 And they were made for Fastex cameras.
4795666 4802129 Fastex cameras were cameras that<br />would go 30,000 frames a second, in 16,
4802298 4808715 and basically a 100-foot roll of film would<br />go through the camera in about two seconds.
4809179 4813298 And they would use these flashbulbs<br />to light whatever they were shooting
4813475 4816433 because they were like the sun,<br />incredibly bright.
4816603 4819265 So then we did the plates,<br />and I'm trying to remember
4819440 4822728 if one plate had a lens flare in it.
4823152 4825940 We had problems like that.<br />It was just a nightmare.
4826113 4829902 And when you have a flare in the plate,<br />that's that kiss of death,
4830075 4836492 because you can't get rid of it<br />with any analogue techniques 100%
4836665 4838952 without doing it 500 times
4840002 4842915 with Marlboro package wrappers,
4843714 4847457 and neutral density<br />difference in certain areas.
4847634 4851252 You put one piece of cellophane in,<br />it would make it work.
4851430 4855845 And I still don't think McTiernan loved<br />the shot once we finally finished it.
4856018 4858476 He still wasn't happy with it.
5745406 5748239 Foot moccasins,<br />because Bruce was gonna be
5748409 5752778 running around on glass all the time<br />because of all the shooting,
5752956 5756074 and he was barefoot<br />cos that was part of the scene.
5756501 5761667 So we actually cast his foot and made<br />a rubber foot that would go on top
5761839 5764547 so that he could run around<br />on these shards of glass.
5764717 5770963 They put a strong kind of vinyl material<br />so that he wouldn't get his feet cut.
5771432 5773298 Steel-belted.
5774060 5777223 So we made half a dozen<br />sets of those, I think.
6671039 6674998 This is funny. Because the helicopters<br />we got were one-seventh scale,
6675169 6677661 we built the miniature one-seventh.
6678297 6682416 So we built a portion<br />of the Fox Plaza building,
6682593 6685802 which had just been finished<br />and it was perfectly pristine,
6685971 6689680 and not only was<br />Ronald Reagan's office there,
6689850 6692433 but I have a patent<br />and labor relations attorney
6692603 6695265 whose office was in the building as well.
6695439 6698477 Because Joel Silver<br />had taken over the building
6698650 6702268 and was supposed to finish shooting<br />by a certain day but didn't,
6702446 6706407 all the people in the Fox Plaza building<br />decided they weren't gonna pay their rent.
6706491 6712237 They said, "We'll pay the rent as soon as<br />you turn this back into an office building,"
6712414 6714530 cos it was a mess.
6714708 6720169 The grounds around the building,<br />which were perfectly just done marble,
6720339 6722956 and the grass had all been sodded,
6723133 6727297 and wonderful specimen trees<br />and all that stuff was around,
6727471 6730054 was going to look like Beirut.
6730432 6733675 But in any case, in order<br />to make the shots work,
6734561 6737019 because a movie is<br />always done by the shot,
6737189 6742775 and you see this angle, then we can build<br />what you see in that shot as a miniature.
6743320 6747154 So we built about the top ten floors or so
6747658 6751401 as a miniature that were<br />in scale to the helicopter.
6751578 6755071 And, of course, that was a big shot,<br />the helicopter exploding,
6755249 6758492 cos the explosion was<br />the ultimate crowd pleaser.
6758669 6763709 Everybody watches fireworks on the 4th of<br />July. It's wonderful to watch explosions.
6763882 6768126 But it had to be great,<br />and we did some testing.
6768303 6771671 We built all this in our parking lot<br />down in the marina,
6771848 6776968 and raised the ire of people who lived on<br />the other side of the street in apartments
6777145 6780308 that we were blowing things up<br />all day or all night.
6780482 6785192 In fact, we even had David Horowitz show<br />up because one of the women called him up,
6785362 6791153 but he was kind of a sympathizer because<br />peculiarly, the street that the studio was on,
6791326 6794739 on one side of the<br />street it was zoned for R1,
6794913 6798952 which is apartments or something<br />like that, or R1A or something.
6799126 6803620 On the other side of the street,<br />it was zoned for light industrial,
6803797 6808291 and so we had been there as a studio<br />before these apartments were there.
6808468 6812006 So the cops were kind of<br />looking the other way.
6812222 6816967 We weren't making that much noise anyway,<br />but they were still uptight about it.
6817144 6820762 In any case, we built<br />the several sized miniatures,
6821398 6824811 and when we exploded<br />the helicopter off the top,
6824985 6830947 originally we planned to have a flying<br />helicopter, and we had some in other shots.
6831116 6834654 There were quite a number of helicopters<br />added into those scenes
6834828 6839618 because you couldn't fly a helicopter<br />within 500 feet of the building.
6839791 6843455 There was no helipad on top<br />or anything like that.
6843628 6847917 We could only fly the helicopter<br />right down the middle of the street.
6848091 6852585 So a few of those are real shots,<br />but all the other shots of helicopters
6852763 6856472 were either shot on a stage with<br />a bluescreen, such as the shots
6856808 6859926 of the guys getting ready to shoot<br />and things like that.
6860103 6866440 I'll come back to that part in a minute, but<br />let me concentrate on the helicopter explosions.
6866610 6871229 We had a virtuoso<br />miniature helicopter pilot,
6871406 6873449 who had worked out a lot of those problems
6873533 6877618 and had worked out a charge<br />in the helicopter, and the timing system,
6878413 6880331 and it had lights on it and everything.
6880415 6884374 When it crashed into the building,<br />it would blow up,
6884544 6888162 but the explosion was not<br />being carried by the helicopter.
6888340 6890422 It was already on the building.
6890592 6894551 All the synchronization of that<br />had to be within a frame or two.
6894721 6900012 If you look in the scene, the high-speed<br />camera was shooting at 300 frames a second.
6900185 6903598 The idea here is that<br />when a big thing falls,
6903772 6907185 it takes more time for it<br />to fall than a small thing.
6907359 6911102 So if you take a cereal<br />box and tip it over,
6912781 6915831 at 24 frames a second it looks<br />like a cereal box tipping over.
6915951 6918943 If you took the cereal box,<br />painted little windows on it,
6919121 6922771 and shot it at 300 frames a second,<br />it would look like a building falling.
6923250 6926788 So that's the kind of trick<br />of high-speed photography,
6926962 6929203 and the way to make miniatures work.
6929381 6932590 So when it came down to<br />actually getting the shot
6932759 6934921 the night that we got the hero take,
6935095 6939840 I think we only did about two or three<br />takes on it before we had it down.
6940016 6945432 Of course, after every take there would be<br />a fire, and the guys would put the fire out.
6945605 6947937 Then another helicopter would be...
6948108 6953069 We had, I think, three helicopters<br />available to us for this thing.
6953613 6957447 And they're not cheap, these real<br />fancy remote-controlled helicopters
6957617 6960075 that are all painted up and tricked out.
6960245 6963289 They're not just out of the box,<br />cos they have to be detailed.
6963373 6967867 The audience picks up detail peripherally,<br />and if it's not there, it looks like a toy.
6968044 6970877 So Thaine is on top of the building,<br />out of camera range,
6971047 6973129 and we're getting ready to shoot.
6973300 6976964 The motor is running on the helicopter,<br />and it's hovering there.
6977137 6983804 It comes down and hits, and Thaine sees<br />that it's not going to go over the edge.
6983977 6988596 He has a stick in his hand just in case,<br />and he pushes the thing over the edge.
6988773 6993142 And it tumbles over the edge<br />perfectly and then blows up,
6993320 6995652 and the shot came off fantastic.
6995822 6997859 We were just ecstatic the next day.
6998033 7002072 Then Joel Silver, the producer,<br />calls me up on the phone.
7002245 7007866 And Joel sometimes talks so loud<br />on the phone that the sound breaks up.
7008043 7010535 The mic can't handle his volume.
7012047 7016416 He says "Edlund, that shot<br />was absolutely legitimate,"
7016593 7019961 which was a great compliment<br />from Joel, and he was real happy.
7020138 7023506 "That shot better be good",<br />cos you get pressure from him, too.
7023683 7026641 And it's always a happy accident<br />in those situations,
7026811 7032102 because you get everything<br />as perfect as you possibly can.
7032776 7035359 The building is tricked out and detailed,
7035529 7039488 there's guys up there putting little<br />pieces of chart tape on the thing
7039658 7043242 to get the thing to look<br />just like the Fox Plaza building,
7043411 7045618 which is a really beautiful building.
7045789 7052286 It has photographic marble glued<br />onto the sides of Plexiglas for windows.
7054005 7058545 It's a simple building, actually,<br />but it still has to be detailed well.
7058718 7063554 So, in any case, you get all of these<br />elements as close to perfect as you can,
7063723 7068638 then you cross your fingers and you're at<br />the mercy of the gods of visual effects.
7070230 7074224 And also the talent, and intelligence,
7074401 7078565 and split-second reactions<br />of a guy like Thaine.
7079322 7085659 He made the shot work, otherwise we would<br />have been shooting again the next night.
7086371 7090205 Then there's a scene where Bruce has<br />these people on top of the building,
7090375 7093834 and you've got Johnson<br />and Johnson in the helicopter.
7094004 7098714 You have the gun aiming at him,<br />you have the focus change shot,
7099259 7101375 all of which was done separately.
7101553 7103214 The plate was shot
7103555 7105762 actually on the top of the building,
7105932 7111143 and then the helicopters were shot<br />out at Veluzee's ranch by Bill Neil,
7111313 7114647 who then would line up<br />the plate to the helicopter.
7114816 7120357 And then when the helicopter flies<br />behind Willis, we have to rotoscope him,
7120530 7125775 but when it flies behind the satellite<br />dish, it's a panning shot, a compound move,
7126369 7131239 and all of this was done<br />by seat-of-the-pants kind of approach.
7132000 7138497 And we could do that because the sky's all<br />black and the helicopter's not nailed down,
7138673 7143793 so we just had to get the dynamics of the<br />helicopter to work within another scene.
7143970 7147759 We could approach it that way<br />and not get overly complicated
7147932 7149809 with a bunch of motion-control equipment,
7149893 7155013 which takes too much time to set up,<br />and often times in those situations,
7155190 7159900 where you do certain types of things<br />with motion-control, it stiffens the shot.
7160070 7166362 So you don't have Jan de Boot's hand-held<br />camera on the shoulder feel to a scene,
7166534 7172155 which gives it a verve, which is what I<br />think is part of the charm of that movie.
7172415 7176500 So it's kind of a nervous<br />photographic approach to it.
7176670 7180038 It's like, "You're there and you<br />got to get the shot" kind of feel
7180215 7184709 transfers from the operator of<br />the camera through to the audience.
7186137 7191382 And this was a really tricky shot because<br />John McTiernan's a very demanding guy,
7191559 7193800 and he knows what he wants.
7193978 7197312 In this case, he even talked Alan Rickman<br />into doing his own stunt,
7197482 7200395 and stunt men, by the way,<br />won't fall backwards.
7201486 7207653 You can't ask a stunt man to fall backwards.<br />You could check it out with quite a few,
7207826 7212571 and they'd say, "I don't wanna do that,"<br />cos they wanna see where they're going.
7212747 7215082 In this case,<br />Alan Rickman had to fall backwards,
7215166 7220787 and the setup was, we had the camera<br />looking down, up very high in the stage.
7220964 7226084 And then there was a huge blue mattress,
7226261 7233179 an air mattress, about eight or ten feet thick,<br />that was covered with bluescreen material,
7233351 7236639 which was lit by hundreds<br />of thousands of watts.
7237021 7240104 This was in 1987 or<br />1988 when we shot this,
7241109 7244147 and I think we may<br />have had 250-speed film.
7244779 7246770 But he was falling...
7246948 7253948 At the start, if you remember, the close-up<br />was close on his face, close enough to...
7254497 7258866 Maybe it was like this, cos you<br />could see him reaching for the gun,
7259043 7263162 and then pulling the<br />gun out, and shooting.
7263506 7268467 And we shot at... I believe<br />it was 300 frames a second,
7268636 7272300 and I think because of the film speed,
7272474 7274966 we had about a two-eight stop.
7275143 7278352 It might have even been wider than that.
7278521 7281434 We may have horsed it back<br />a little open from two-eight
7281608 7284646 cos the scene was slightly underexposed.
7286112 7288945 Which I hate, underexposed shots.
7289115 7292358 But the thing is, the<br />focus was so critical.
7293286 7297029 And in order to deal with the focus,<br />we built a special device,
7297207 7302748 which was a little Miller head<br />for a 16-millimeter...
7302921 7305709 A small Miller hydraulic head.
7305882 7308294 And we mounted an encoder on that,
7308468 7311711 so that as you moved the head,
7311888 7315756 it would spin out numbers<br />at a very high resolution.
7316351 7321016 And we mounted a 2-7 zoom riflescope
7321356 7323893 on top of the head so<br />the cameraman could...
7324067 7329107 We had an eyepiece that came out with a<br />rubber thing so he could glue his eye to it.
7329280 7331738 And so Bill's assistant...
7333368 7339410 The assistant had to follow him down<br />with this tripod and the cross hairs,
7340333 7342370 and as he followed him down,
7342544 7347380 the angle that he went<br />was then interpolated to distance.
7348132 7351591 And we did focus changes,<br />and we did a look-up table,
7351928 7355137 so that he was 30 feet away<br />with this telescope.
7356474 7360308 And so the focus was automatic,<br />filtered through this.
7362647 7367266 And we only had one shot at this,<br />so there was an extreme pressure.
7368236 7371854 Because Rickman said, "OK,<br />I'll do it, but I'll only do it once."
7372031 7377322 And, of course, we had the high-speed<br />camera, and we had video tap.
7377495 7381079 And we did the shot, and it was good.
7381499 7384912 The focus was right,<br />and we looked at the video.
7385086 7390627 He fell quickly in the video, but we'd stop<br />it, and we could see the focus was holding.
7390800 7393007 John said, "Let's do it one more time."
7393177 7397967 So he talked Rickman into doing another<br />take, and I'm not sure which take we used.
7398141 7400382 We may have actually used the first take.
7400560 7403803 We used every single frame possible to use
7403980 7409020 because at one point he fell into the<br />lights that were lighting the bluescreen,
7409193 7414484 and of course the lighting went berserk<br />and we couldn't use it any more.
7414782 7417900 But he would say, "Can you<br />give me two more frames?"
7418077 7421320 We went through that, and we probably did.
7421497 7424239 But that was all there was left to give.
7424417 7429287 It was 26 or 28 feet,<br />I seem to remember, that he fell.
7430423 7437423 And he started about maybe three<br />or four feet, if that, from the lens,
7438431 7443050 because it was a pretty wide lens,<br />I think it was a 35, that we used for it.
7443227 7446185 So he would have been probably<br />three feet from the lens,
7446356 7448814 and held sharp focus all the way back.
7448983 7455104 That was a really great shot, then behind it<br />we shot a plate from the top of the Fox Plaza,
7455281 7462199 and then Bill Neil shot miniaturized<br />pieces of paper with a high-speed camera.
7463331 7469293 Because on all these shots, the air's filled<br />with all this paper that was floating around.
7471381 7473497 And because the shot was...
7473675 7476417 We had to start on the miniature.
7476594 7479837 The miniature was<br />composited into the scene,
7480014 7483177 and then at a certain point<br />we panned off the miniature.
7483351 7489563 And once we'd panned off the miniature,<br />the camera was then booming around
7489732 7492815 on this huge Titan crane.
7493528 7497897 But we still, in those shots even,<br />had to have this paper.
7498074 7502693 There was a certain amount of real paper,<br />but we had to put paper in the distance.
7502870 7504986 That was an incredibly complicated shot,
7505164 7509283 and I thought that was<br />gonna be the most difficult shot.
7509460 7513545 And that was one of those things that...<br />It was the most difficult shot,
7514048 7518588 but it fell together so well<br />that all the elements worked,
7518761 7524882 and it was basically done all of a sudden,<br />and everybody loved it, and I was dazed.
7525059 7528677 Then the final shot, which was the...
7528855 7534191 This was this nightmare, and it was<br />Bill Neil who did the tracking on this.
7534360 7540606 But Neil and I, Neil Krepela and I,<br />were over there shooting the plate,
7540783 7545402 and so we're working with Jan's assistant,
7545580 7548618 and we got pushed into the corner on this.
7548791 7553877 This is what McTiernan wanted in this<br />shot, and I was extremely nervous about it.
7554047 7556630 And one of the problems that we had was...
7558134 7560421 Remember that this is a pre-digital age,
7560595 7565510 so what you got on the negative, you were<br />stuck with, and you had to deal with it.
7565683 7570644 We had made a request to all these people<br />in the building to turn their lights out
7570813 7574477 so that we could then put<br />our own lights into the building.
7574650 7578188 But there was such anger<br />towards the motion picture company,
7578362 7581525 because they had been<br />inconvenienced for so long,
7581699 7586614 that there were about 20 or 30<br />window lights on still in the building,
7586788 7588574 which meant that we would then
7588915 7591703 not be able to go into black with that,
7591876 7593867 and just track in a miniature.
7594045 7601042 The miniature had to track window for<br />window, and this is in the pre-tracking days.
7601219 7603460 All that kind of stuff you can do now.
7603638 7607802 Some guy that's just learned<br />how to spell "CG" can track now.
7607975 7614312 But in those days it was an unbelievably<br />masochistic, difficult proposition to do that.
7614482 7618476 But we did it. Bill did<br />it, and what he did is,
7618653 7624899 projected the shot through the camera<br />onto a miniature on the stage,
7625076 7630162 and lined up each shot, and then he'd move it<br />to the next shot, and we'd line that one up.
7631499 7635163 So it was like this sort of<br />big projection animation setup,
7635336 7639500 and then when he'd get it all tracked<br />frame by frame that way,
7641342 7645802 we had nice motion-control equipment<br />that Jerry Jeffers and his guys had built.
7645972 7649931 I think we may have even had<br />an early Kuper system,
7650101 7654095 which was Al Tondreau,<br />who for some reason
7654272 7657685 that's another mystery -<br />changed his name to Kuper.
7657859 7663445 He disappeared from the planet. He had some<br />kind of brain tumor or something like that,
7663614 7665730 and all of a sudden he was gone.
7665908 7670869 And everybody in town was depending on<br />Bill Tondreau for motion-control equipment,
7671038 7674488 and all of a sudden he was gone,<br />and it was, "Oh, God, where do we..."
7674584 7677042 It was like paralysis.
7677628 7682668 There was such dependence on this one guy<br />and his brilliant motion-control thing.
7682842 7686335 Then all of a sudden he surfaced again,<br />but he had changed his name
7686512 7688970 and didn't want to talk about it.
7689807 7691844 But anyway,
7692018 7697013 Bill had gone through<br />this arduous tracking procedure,
7697190 7699727 and it was perfect.
7699901 7704520 Once he had the tracking, we had to<br />put the fire on the top of the building.
7705156 7710617 And then the same tracking had to be used<br />for all this paper that was floating around.
7712747 7716490 I was real happy with<br />the success of the movie.
7718044 7721421 What I loved about it, it was really<br />great collaborating with Al on it,
7721505 7725715 cos Al Di Sarro is<br />a really good physical effects guy,
7725885 7728718 and we got along just great.
7728888 7733348 My attitude always is to try<br />to get it in camera if you can,
7734060 7736392 and then use effects if you can't,
7737021 7740264 and not try to get extra shots to do it.
7741067 7748067 Because usually you have enough under your<br />arm at the end of shooting to worry about
7749492 7751733 without stacking with extra shots.
7751911 7758453 And on top of that, somehow to do it in<br />the camera, in reel, always looks better.
7758626 7761960 Or not always, but most of the time,<br />so if you can do it that way,
7762129 7766373 I'm a big supporter of trying to<br />work with the physical effect guy
7766550 7769258 to figure out how we could do it physical,
7769428 7773467 or do most of it physical<br />so we're enhancing certain parts of it.
7773641 7778226 And one great shot that he did, because he<br />had a second-unit guy go over and shoot,
7778396 7781013 there was a big explosion from a distance,
7781190 7785980 and we thought, "There's no way they're<br />ever gonna allow you to do that, AI."
7786570 7790734 It wasn't actually that difficult a shot<br />if we were going to do it.
7790908 7794244 But AI pulled it off. He had a guy<br />over there and it was a great shot,
7794328 7798322 a distant shot where you saw the building<br />and this big flame going up on top.
7798499 7801412 So that kind of thing is always great,
7801585 7807126 and in that sense it was one of my favorite<br />collaborative jobs with a physical effects guy
7807300 7812670 because we knew were supporting each other in<br />the things that either one of us couldn't do.
7812847 7818513 And I think basically McTiernan<br />was very happy with the show,
7818686 7823271 and Joel Silver was elated<br />because it made millions,
7823441 7825603 and everybody loved it.
7825776 7832776 Even my wife likes it, and she's not that<br />much of a fan of action-adventure films.
7834118 7837236 But she loved it. She<br />likes Bruce Willis, too.
