55932 58226 You don't like flying, do you?
59268 61354 What gives you that idea?
63439 68152 You wanna know the secret<br />to surviving air travel?
68236 71239 After you get where you're going,<br />take off your shoes and socks.
71322 76744 Then you walk around on the rug barefoot<br />and make fists with your toes.
76827 79038 Fists with your toes?
79789 83960 I know. It sounds crazy. Trust me.<br />I've been doing it for nine years.
84043 88214 Yes, sir! Better than a shower<br />and a hot cup of coffee.
88297 89257 OK.
99392 101519 It's OK. I'm a cop.
103437 107275 Trust me.<br />I've been doing this for 11 years.
107566 112446 The captain and the crew<br />would like to welcome you to Los Angeles.
112530 115908 Have a very merry Christmas.
123874 127920 Flight 247 to Tucson<br />now boarding at gate 14.
129714 134468 Flight 247 to Tucson<br />now boarding at gate 14.
163205 164915 Ladies and gentlemen...
164999 167293 Ladies and gentlemen!
167376 171797 I want to congratulate all of you for<br />making this one of the greatest years
171922 174467 in the history of the Nakatomi Corporation.
178179 181182 On behalf of the<br />Chief Executive Officer, Mr Ozu,
181265 183434 and the Board of Directors,
183517 187730 we thank you one and all and wish you<br />a merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
187813 190983 Merry Christmas! Happy New Year!
191984 195488 Hey, Holly. What about dinner tonight?
195571 198199 Harry, it's Christmas Eve.
198282 201327 Families, stockings...
202453 204538 Chestnuts?
204622 208709 Rudolph and Frosty?<br />Any of these things ring a bell?
208793 213714 Actually, I was thinking more of<br />mulled wine, a nice aged Brie,
213798 218344 and a roaring fireplace.<br />You know what I'm saying?
220262 223599 Ginny, it's 5:40. Go join the party.<br />Have some champagne.
223682 226310 You're making me feel<br />like Ebenezer Scrooge.
226394 230106 Thanks. Do you think the baby<br />can handle a little sip?
230189 233275 That baby's ready to tend bar.
233859 234735 Last chance.
234819 236695 Bye.
242660 245663 McClane residence.<br />Lucy McClane speaking.
245746 250167 Hello, Lucy McClane.<br />This is your mother speaking.
250251 253212 Mommy! When are you coming home?
253295 257258 Pretty soon. You'll be in bed<br />when I get there though.
257341 259844 Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?
259927 264265 And no snooping around the house<br />looking for presents.
264348 266851 Is Daddy coming home with you?
268936 273441 Well, we'll see what Santa<br />and Mommy can do, OK?
273524 275651 Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.
275734 277236 Paulina!
282366 284243 Hola, Mrs Holly.
284326 287204 Did Mr McClane call?
287288 289915 No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.
290916 294003 He probably didn't have time<br />before his flight.
294086 298048 It might be a good idea to make up<br />the spare bedroom, just in case.
298132 301135 Si, Mrs Holly. I do that already.
301218 304346 What would I do without you, Paulina?
329747 330915 California!
344011 346096 Hey, I'm John McClane.
346180 348766 Argyle. I'm your limo driver.
351977 354104 Nice bear.
357691 361695 OK, Argyle. What do we do now?
361779 366617 I was hoping you could tell me.<br />It's my first time driving a limo.
366700 369620 That's OK.<br />It's my first time riding in one.
369954 372540 Relax. We got everything in this mug, man.
372623 375876 Look at this, CD, CB, TV,
375960 378462 telephone, full bar, VHS.
380256 384802 If your friend's hot to trot, I know<br />a few mama bears we can hook up with.
386136 389014 - Or is he married?<br />- He's married.
389098 390140 OK.
391809 395104 Oh, sorry about that.<br />It's the girl's day off.
395187 397523 I didn't know you were gonna sit up front.
397606 399567 Your lady live out here?
399650 402069 About the past six months.
402152 404405 Meaning you still live in New York?
405197 408409 You always ask this many questions, Argyle?
408492 413080 Sorry. I used to drive a cab<br />and people would expect a little chitchat.
413163 416458 - So, you divorced?<br />- Just drive the car, man.
416542 420379 Hey, come on. You divorced?<br />You separated? She beat you up?!
423299 427428 She had a good job.<br />It turned into a great career.
427511 432433 - That meant she had to move here.<br />- You're very fast, Argyle.
432516 435185 So, why didn't you come?
437855 441317 Well? Why didn't you come with her?<br />What's up?
441400 443235 Because I'm a New York cop.
443319 447031 I got a backlog of scumbags<br />I'm still trying to put behind bars.
447114 449116 I can't just go that easy.
449199 451702 You thought she wasn't<br />gonna make it out here,
451785 456123 and she'd come crawling back to you<br />so why bother to pack, right?
456206 459293 Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.
459376 461378 Mind if we hear some tunes?
464548 466759 Hey, that'll work.
469386 470721 No Christmas music?
471055 473599 This is Christmas music.
502795 505381 So your lady sees you,<br />you run into her arms,
505464 509134 the music comes up<br />and you live happily ever after, right?
509218 512012 I can live with that.
512096 515933 So, if it doesn't work out,<br />you got a place to stay?
516016 518686 I'll find a place.
518769 524191 I tell you what. I'll wait in the garage.<br />You score, give me a call on the car phone.
524274 529113 I'll take your bags to the desk.<br />You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.
529196 533742 - You're all right, Argyle.<br />- Remember that when you sign for the tip.
557307 559560 - Hi.<br />- Good evening.
559643 561603 I'm here to see Holly McClane.
561687 563856 Just type it in there.
569987 571155 Cute toy.
571238 575826 Yeah, if you have to take a leak,<br />it'll even help you find your zipper.
591300 593343 Christ!
598390 600517 - 30th floor?<br />- The party.
600601 602603 They're the only ones left.
602686 606440 Take the express elevator.<br />Get off where you hear the noise.
606523 608025 Thanks.
666208 668710 - Champagne, sir?<br />- Yeah, thanks.
703120 705038 I'm sorry.
705622 708125 Hey! Merry Christmas!
711795 713547 Jesus.
714172 715757 Fuckin' California!
715841 717968 I couldn't agree with you more.
718302 720262 Why don't I talk to him right now?
721138 723765 Hi. I'm looking for...
723849 725225 - Holly Gennero.<br />- Yeah.
725309 727269 Then you must be John McClane.
727352 729730 Joe Takagi. How was your ride in?
729813 732316 Nice. I have you to thank for that?
732399 734443 Seemed the least we could do.
734526 738405 - Quite a place you have here.<br />- It will be if we ever get it finished.
738488 740490 Still several floors under construction.
740574 744369 Holly went to fax some documents.<br />She should be back any minute.
744453 747664 In the meanwhile, her office is back here.
749958 750959 Ellis?
752169 755923 I was making a call.<br />This was the nearest phone.
756006 758592 I want you to meet John McClane,
758675 760719 Holly's husband.
760802 762679 Holly's policeman.
762763 765098 Ellis is in charge<br />of international development.
765182 767392 Heard a lot about you.
767476 769269 You missed some.
770854 772564 Can I get you anything?
772648 775692 Food? Cake?<br />Some watered-down champagne?
775776 777861 No, thank you. I'm fine.
779321 781531 You throw quite a party.
782532 785452 I didn't realise they celebrated<br />Christmas in Japan.
785535 789665 We're flexible. Pearl Harbor didn't work out,<br />so we got you with tape decks.
792417 797714 It's a double celebration. We closed<br />a big deal today, mainly due to Holly.
798966 801551 I'll be out in a couple of minutes.
805722 807057 John.
811228 815190 - Have you met everyone?<br />- We've been sticking him with spears!
815273 817859 Of course he has.
817943 821113 She was made for the business.<br />Tough as nails.
821196 823907 I was hoping you made that flight.
823991 826159 Show him the watch.
826743 828203 Later.
828286 832207 Show him. Are you embarrassed?<br />It's a token of appreciation
832290 835711 for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.
835794 838296 I'm sure I'll see it later.
838380 841383 Is there a place where I could wash up?
841466 842926 Sure.
858525 862863 You have to forgive Ellis.<br />He gets very depressed this time of year.
862946 866199 He thought he was<br />God's greatest gift, you know?
866283 868577 I know the type.
868660 871705 I think he's got his eye on you.
871788 875625 That's OK. I have my eye<br />on his private bathroom.
875709 878795 Where are you staying?<br />Things happened so fast
878879 881631 I didn't get a chance<br />to ask you on the phone.
881715 884217 Cappy Roberts retired out here.
884926 889556 - He said I could bunk with him.<br />- Cappy retired, huh? Where's he live?
889639 892851 - Romona.<br />- Pomona.
893185 895520 Pomona.
895645 897481 - Pomona.<br />- Yeah.
898398 900734 You'll be in the car half the time.
902194 905739 Why don't we make it easy?<br />I have a spare bedroom.
905822 908450 It's not huge or anything, but...
908533 911995 the kids would love<br />to have you at the house.
913205 916124 They would?
918085 920378 I would too.
923590 925008 Sorry.
931932 934518 I missed you.
940899 943777 Didn't miss my name though, huh?
943860 947072 Except maybe when you're signing cheques?
947155 950033 Since when did you start using Ms Gennero?
952202 956123 This is a Japanese company.<br />They figure a married woman's...
956206 958291 You are a married woman.
958375 963130 - This conversation again?<br />- We never finished this conversation.
963213 968468 - I had an opportunity. I had to take it.<br />- No matter what it did to our marriage.
968552 972681 - It changed your idea of our marriage.<br />- You have no clue what my idea...
972764 976351 I know exactly what your idea<br />of our marriage should be.
976434 978228 Ms Gennero, I...
979938 981648 Excuse me.
982232 983525 Hi.
984818 989531 Mr Takagi is looking for you.<br />He wants you to say something to the troops.
989614 990407 Thank you.
995078 996913 Speech time.
996997 999499 Be back in a few minutes.
1010719 1012345 That was great, John.
1012429 1015432 Good job. Very mature.
1065148 1070195 So Kareem rebounds. Feeds Worthy<br />on the break, over to AC, to Magic,
1070278 1072822 then back to Worthy.
1072906 1074741 Boom! Two points.
1079537 1080163 We're in.
1229646 1230897 Links...
1233858 1234943 rechts,
1235026 1236820 und wieder links.
1267350 1268935 Son of a bitch.
1272147 1274315 Fists with your toes.
1305597 1307140 Yeah, Argyle?
1307223 1308725 How's it going?
1308808 1310059 OK. Where are you?
1310143 1313104 At the garage.<br />What's with you and your lady?
1314063 1315482 The vote's not in yet.
1323948 1327202 - He, Bruder.<br />- Moment.
1327285 1328745 Nein! Nein! Nein!
1328828 1330663 Warte doch. Nicht!
1347347 1348389 Argyle?
1349015 1351100 Mac, you there? Hello?
1359692 1361778 You know the number. Use it.
1453995 1456873 Stay calm. Everything's going to be fine.
1456956 1458833 Everything's going to be fine.
1478227 1479604 Shit!
1482899 1484067 Think.
1484525 1486027 Think.
1501918 1505171 Ladies and gentlemen.
1506005 1507590 Ladies and gentlemen.
1514931 1519227 Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's<br />legacy of greed around the globe,
1519310 1524524 they're about to be taught a lesson<br />in the real use of power.
1524607 1526818 You will be witnesses.
1529028 1530029 Now,
1531114 1532990 where is Mr Takagi?
1535618 1539038 Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,
1540540 1542500 born Kyoto, 1937.
1542583 1544836 Don't move.
1544919 1548631 Family emigrated to San Pedro,<br />California, 1939,
1550091 1554595 interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43,
1555930 1559600 scholarship student,<br />University of California,
1560184 1562019 1955.
1565982 1570570 Law degree, Stanford, 1962.
1570653 1573948 MBA, Harvard, 1970.
1575575 1577827 President, Nakatomi Trading.
1577910 1581247 Vice Chairman, Nakatomi Investment Group...
1581330 1582415 Enough.
1583541 1585626 And father
1585710 1587253 of five.
1587336 1590298 I am Takagi.
1590381 1592508 How do you do?
1592967 1594802 It's a pleasure to meet you.
1607315 1610151 OK, 32 construction, 33 computers.
1623664 1625208 Nice suit.
1626000 1628503 John Phillips, London.
1630505 1632799 I have two myself.
1633216 1636928 Rumour has it Arafat buys his there.
1641057 1643684 - This way?<br />- On the left.
1665832 1669585 And when Alexander saw<br />the breadth of his domain
1669669 1673548 he wept, for there were<br />no more worlds to conquer.
1678052 1680805 The benefits of a classical education.
1681931 1685059 Oh, that's beautiful.
1686769 1689438 I always enjoyed to make models<br />when I was a boy.
1689522 1694277 The exactness, the attention<br />to every conceivable detail.
1695111 1696696 It's beautiful.
1696779 1701242 Is this what this is all about?<br />Our project in Indonesia?
1701325 1704203 Contrary to what you people may think,
1704287 1707415 we're going to develop<br />that region, not exploit it.
1707498 1712128 I believe you.<br />I read the article in Forbes.
1714171 1716257 Mr Takagi...
1717258 1721012 I could talk about industrialisation<br />and men's fashions all day,
1721095 1723139 but I'm afraid work must intrude,
1723222 1727059 and my associate here<br />has some questions for you.
1727143 1730062 Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions.
1739572 1741365 I don't have that code.
1742408 1746037 You broke in here to access our computer?
1746120 1749373 Any information you get,<br />when Tokyo wake up, they'll change it.
1749457 1752335 You won't be able to blackmail<br />our executives...
1752418 1754462 Sit down!
1764347 1768893 Mr Takagi, I'm really not<br />interested in your computer.
1773230 1775775 But I need the code key
1775858 1780237 because I am interested in the $640 million
1780321 1784742 in negotiable bearer bonds<br />that you have locked in your vault
1784825 1788454 and the computer controls the vault.
1789705 1791999 You want money?
1792083 1794460 What kind of terrorists are you?
1797755 1800216 Who said we were terrorists?
1819777 1822530 The bonds represent, at most,
1822613 1826409 ten days' operating capital<br />for your parent organisation.
1826492 1829829 It's really no more<br />than a temporary inconvenience.
1829912 1830955 Now...
1835334 1837128 the code, please.
1838421 1841632 It's useless to you.<br />There are seven safeguards on our vault.
1841716 1844385 The code key's only one.<br />You won't get it open.
1844468 1847805 Then there's no reason<br />not to tell it to us.
1847888 1851851 - I told you.<br />- It's not over yet.
1856439 1860109 It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.
1860818 1864030 It would be a shame to ruin it.
1866282 1868617 I'm going to count to three.
1869660 1872621 There will not be a four.
1873122 1875374 Give me the code.
1876459 1877626 One.
1880671 1881964 Two.
1883966 1886052 - Three.<br />- I don't know it.
1886802 1889013 Get on a jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman.
1889096 1890723 You'll have to kill me.
1891348 1892099 OK.
1896145 1897563 We do it the hard way.
1897646 1899648 Tony, dispose of that.
1899732 1903069 Karl, check on Heinrich's work<br />on the machine floor.
1928469 1929428 Nothing.
1930262 1931931 See to Heinrich.
1933516 1934934 Now...
1935392 1938437 you can break the code?
1938521 1943609 You didn't bring me along<br />for my charming personality.
1948197 1952701 Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.<br />You're calling the police now.
1952785 1956372 Of course I'm still coming by later.
1956455 1959291 Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?
1959375 1961836 My boss thinks I'm on my way to Vegas.
1963212 1965673 Uli, get up on the pipes.
1966423 1968759 Marco, you go through here.
1970302 1972638 I'll throw you the cord.
1976225 1978811 Hans, we're on the roof.
1991240 1992533 Here.
1996036 1997288 Uli.
2004587 2006046 30 minutes to break the code,
2006130 2011468 two and a half hours<br />for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.
2011552 2014722 The seventh lock, however,<br />is out of my hands.
2037411 2038746 I'm sorry?
2038829 2042291 The seventh lock...<br />the electromagnetic seal.
2042374 2044752 The circuits cannot be cut locally.
2046545 2047796 Trust me.
2049632 2052676 Why the fuck didn't you stop him, John?
2053802 2056597 Cos then you'd be dead too, asshole.
2056680 2058682 Think, goddamn it! Think!
2071111 2072821 We've got a fire alarm.
2073447 2075115 Call 911.
2075199 2079203 Give them the guard's name<br />and cancel the alarm.
2079286 2080579 Then disable the sys...
2083999 2086919 Eddie, on what floor did the alarm go off?
2088462 2090798 Shall we go?
2090881 2092091 Nein.
2103143 2104478 Yes.
2104561 2107731 Hello, baby. Come to Papa. Come on.
2111277 2113112 Come on, baby.
2113195 2114321 Come on, baby.
2114405 2118993 Come on, baby. Come to Papa.<br />I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.
2121078 2123872 You stupid motherfuckers! No! No!
2123956 2126208 Turn the fuckin' truck around!
2159408 2162494 The fire has been called off, my friend.
2167082 2169501 No one is coming to help you.
2173505 2176717 You might as well come out<br />and join the others.
2179386 2181513 I promise I won't hurt you.
2210959 2214129 Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.
2214213 2215964 You won't hurt me.
2216048 2217883 Yeah? Why not?
2217966 2222304 Because you're a policeman.<br />There are rules for policemen.
2222388 2225891 Yeah, that's what my captain<br />keeps telling me.
2292624 2294751 Bet your ass I wish to proceed.
2335083 2337044 Nine million terrorists in the world
2337127 2340214 and I gotta kill one with feet<br />smaller than my sister.
2389638 2394309 I wanted this to be professional,<br />efficient, adult, cooperative.
2394393 2396186 Not a lot to ask.
2396270 2398480 Mr Takagi did not see it that way
2398564 2402234 so he won't be joining us<br />for the rest of his life.
2404361 2406488 We can go any way you want it.
2407489 2410367 You can walk out of here or be carried out,
2410492 2414496 but have no illusions, we are in charge.
2415998 2419876 So decide now, each of you,
2420043 2422045 and please remember,
2423505 2425632 we have left nothing to chance.
2434016 2435309 Get them back!
2445152 2447613 Now I have a machine gun.
2449281 2452534 Ho, ho, ho.
2455495 2457497 A security guard we missed?
2457581 2463003 They're usually tired, old policemen.<br />No, this is something else.
2463086 2467424 Was hab' ich dir gesagt?<br />Ich will, daß es keiner sieht.
2472346 2474473 We have to do something, Hans.
2474556 2475807 Yes, we do.
2475891 2480395 Tell Karl his brother is dead.<br />Tell him to come down.
2481897 2484232 Karl, komm sofort.
2484316 2488028 Franco, Fritz,<br />take the body upstairs and out of sight.
2488111 2491740 I don't want the hostages<br />to think too much.
2491823 2493909 Komm sofort. Schnell.
2555262 2557013 I want blood!
2557097 2560183 You'll have it, but let<br />Heinrich plant the detonators
2560267 2562853 and Theo prepare the vault.<br />After we call the police,
2562936 2566106 you can tear the building apart<br />looking for this man,
2566189 2569025 but, until then, do not alter the plan!
2569484 2571695 And if he alters it?
2576491 2578368 What do you think?
2580328 2582456 Something's wrong.
2582539 2583874 Cops?
2585792 2588503 - John.<br />- John?
2588587 2592090 He can fuck this up.<br />What does he think he's doing?
2592174 2593425 His job.
2593508 2597179 Bullshit. His job's 3,000 miles away.
2597262 2601558 Without him, we still have<br />a chance to get out of here.
2601641 2603977 Tell that to Takagi.
2627542 2629920 Mayday, anyone copying channel nine.
2630003 2634007 Terrorists have seized the Nakatomi<br />building and are holding 30 people hostage.
2634090 2636218 I repeat.<br />Unknown number of terrorists,
2636301 2639638 six or more armed with<br />automatic weapons at Nakatomi Plaza,
2639721 2640722 Century City.
2640806 2643683 Where's the best place to transmit?
2643767 2645769 The roof! Go! Go!
2648480 2651107 It's the same address<br />as that fire signal.
2651191 2653568 I'll handle it.
2655070 2659366 Attention, whoever you are, this channel<br />is reserved for emergency calls only.
2659449 2662577 No shit!<br />Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza?
2675507 2678301 No one kills him but me.
2678927 2681096 They have already killed one hostage.
2681179 2684724 They're fortifying their positions<br />while you're jerkin' me off!
2684808 2688478 Sir, I've already told you.<br />This is a reserved channel.
2688562 2692315 If this is an emergency call,<br />dial 911 on your telephone.
2692399 2696027 Otherwise,<br />I'll report this as an FCC violation.
2696111 2700031 Fine! Come the fuck down here<br />and arrest me! Just send the police now!
2713587 2717132 See if a black-and-white can drive by.
2728935 2732355 Thought you guys just ate doughnuts.
2732439 2735150 - They're for my wife.<br />- Yeah.
2736359 2739154 - She's pregnant.<br />- Yeah.
2740238 2741156 Bag it.
2742657 2743992 Big time.
2746828 2748371 Thanks.
2751374 2753793 Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30. Over.
2753877 2755837 This is 8-Lincoln-30.
2755921 2760216 Investigate a code two<br />at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.
2760300 2764262 8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch. I'm on my way.
2882505 2883757 Girls.
2885133 2887218 Auf dem Dachboden.
2899439 2901566 Shit! Where the fuck is it?
2923630 2925548 Oh, my God.
2941397 2943608 He's in the elevator shaft.
2944192 2947612 Perfect. The elevators are locked off.<br />He can't escape.
2947695 2949405 Shut him in and come back down.
2953368 2954536 Oh, fuck.
2960375 2964796 Karl, the police are probably<br />on their way already. Karl?
2986234 2987068 Christ.
2992282 2994617 I can stall them,<br />but not if they hear gunshots.
2994701 2997245 If you lock him in, he'll be neutralised...
3062227 3066022 Come out to the coast!<br />We'll get together, have a few laughs.
3072820 3075865 Now I know what a TV dinner feels like.
3085583 3087377 Such!
3143516 3145727 Karl, komm! Die Polizei!
3145810 3147603 Karl, die Polizei!
3192523 3194484 Well, it's about time.
3199113 3201532 No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.
3201616 3205870 Roger. Possible crank call.<br />Check the area again and confirm.
3212377 3214587 Who's driving this car, Stevie Wonder?
3216839 3221302 I do see a guard inside.<br />I'm gonna go in for a closer look.
3221386 3222762 Use caution.
3225973 3227392 Eddie?
3227475 3229769 I had a feelin' you'd be calling.
3253292 3255878 Evenin', officer. What can I do for you?
3259632 3262260 Wieviele sind es?
3262343 3264095 Nur ein Mann.
3267306 3269225 We had that false alarm.
3269308 3273479 You ask me, that goddamn computer<br />sent you on another wild-goose chase.
3273563 3277066 They been chasing bugs<br />ever since they installed it.
3277150 3279444 Notre Dame on top of USC.
3279527 3281279 Aw, shit!
3281362 3283990 I got 50 bucks bet on them assholes.
3285658 3289787 Come on, come on,<br />where's the fuckin' cavalry?
3302592 3306596 Marco, er ist am 34. Geh, schnell, 34.
3313019 3315605 Was good for 52 yards.
3315688 3317815 Mind if I look around?
3317899 3319275 Help yourself.
3319358 3325156 27 seconds left in this first period.<br />Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.
3329285 3332079 - Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!<br />- Don't shoot!
3332163 3334957 - Put the gun down!<br />- OK! Don't shoot!
3335041 3336209 Drop that fuckin' gun!
3336542 3337793 Marco, down!
3354268 3356395 To hell with this!
3365321 3367156 You are done!
3367240 3370326 No more table! Where are you going, pal?
3371369 3374664 Next time you have a chance<br />to kill someone, don't hesitate.
3382046 3383965 Thanks for the advice.
3384298 3387718 - Sorry to waste your time.<br />- No problem at all.
3387802 3390471 - Merry Christmas.<br />- Merry Christmas to you.
3404777 3406612 Oh, for the love...
3410157 3411909 8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.
3411993 3413077 Go ahead.
3413160 3417665 A wild-goose chase at Nakatomi Plaza.<br />Everything here's OK. Over.
3426424 3427383 Shit!
3427466 3429218 Goddamn it! Jesus H Christ!
3437268 3438978 Welcome to the party, pal!
3447403 3449405 Get someone here now!
3449488 3452033 Policeman under automatic<br />rifle fire at Nakatomi!
3452116 3454160 I need backup assistance now!
3455494 3456829 Now, goddamn it! Now!
3475389 3478392 Monica, I can get us a table.
3478476 3481520 Wolfgang and I are very close friends.
3481604 3483272 I interviewed him!
3483356 3485066 Nakatomi.
3485149 3487818 Repeat. Officer needs assistance at...
3487902 3491614 I'm at Nakatomi Plaza.<br />They're turning my car into Swiss cheese!
3491697 3495743 I need backup assistance now!<br />Now, goddamn it! Now!
3516639 3518557 Never thought I'd love to hear that sound.
3518891 3523312 All of you relax. This is a matter<br />of inconvenient timing, that's all.
3523396 3528150 Police action was inevitable...<br />and, as it happens, necessary.
3528234 3533406 So, let them fumble about outside<br />and stay calm. This is simply the beginning.
3535074 3538536 I told you all I wanted<br />radio silence until...
3538619 3541330 I'm sorry, Hans.<br />I didn't get that message.
3541414 3544792 Maybe you should have put it<br />on a bulletin board.
3544875 3547420 I figured since I waxed Tony,<br />Marco and his friend,
3547503 3552341 you and Karl and Franco might be lonely<br />so I wanted to give you a call.
3552425 3555970 How does he know so much about us?
3556053 3558556 That's very kind of you.
3558639 3562226 I assume you are<br />our mysterious party crasher.
3562309 3565896 You are troublesome<br />for a security guard.
3565980 3568774 Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.
3568858 3574488 Would you like to go for double jeopardy<br />where the scores can really change?
3576782 3579160 Mm, these are very bad for you.
3580035 3583914 - Who are you then?<br />- Just the fly in the ointment, Hans.
3583998 3587418 The monkey in the wrench,<br />the pain in the ass.
3592590 3595050 Check on all the others.<br />Don't use the radio.
3595134 3599305 See if he's lying about Marco<br />and find out if anyone else is missing.
3602933 3605019 Mr Mystery Guest...
3606103 3607855 are you still there?
3608606 3613068 Yeah, I'm still here, unless you<br />wanna open the front door for me.
3613152 3615070 No, I'm afraid not,
3615154 3617948 but you have me at a loss.
3618032 3619784 You know my name, but who are you?
3619867 3624038 Just another American<br />who saw too many movies as a child?
3624121 3627291 Another orphan of a bankrupt culture
3627374 3631712 who thinks he's John Wayne,<br />Rambo, Marshal Dillon?
3631796 3637092 I was always partial to Roy Rogers actually.<br />I liked those sequinned shirts.
3637176 3640429 Do you really think you have<br />a chance against us, Mr Cowboy?
3643557 3645893 Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
3649647 3651774 I'll beat everyone if I get a remote.
3651857 3653651 I don't have the new pages.
3653734 3655986 Harvey, keep your pants on.
3656070 3657822 Sam, I'm begging you.
3657905 3661116 Simon's with the remote.<br />I'll tell him to swing by.
3661200 3663035 I won't sit on this!
3663118 3665913 This is my story! I'm going out there!
3665996 3669917 Look, Sam. Tell you what.<br />You don't give me a truck, I'll steal a truck.
3670000 3672419 - Give us a break, Thornburg.<br />- Eat it, Harvey!
3672503 3675089 Four, three, two,
3675172 3676507 one.
3676590 3678926 Harvey, we're on the air.
3682638 3685766 Good evening. This is Harvey Johnson.
3686600 3690396 And I'm Gail Wallens.<br />This is Nightline News at Ten.
3690479 3693274 Our top stories on this Christmas Eve...
3693357 3696527 Take truck number five and get outta here.
3704326 3707746 He wasn't lying about Marco.<br />He's down on the street.
3707830 3710124 The other man was Heinrich,
3710207 3712751 and his bag is missing.
3714253 3716422 He had the detonator.
3720634 3722219 Theo.
3722303 3723345 Theo.
3723554 3724972 Yo!
3725055 3728726 We may have some problems.<br />How's our schedule?
3728809 3734356 - Three down, four to go.<br />- Then don't waste time talking to me.
3734440 3737401 This is Sergeant Al Powell<br />of the LA Police Department.
3737484 3742531 If the person who radioed can hear me,<br />acknowledge this transmission.
3742615 3743657 I say again,
3743741 3747077 if the person who radioed<br />for help can hear me,
3747161 3749622 acknowledge this transmission!
3753918 3756545 I read you, pal. You the guy in the car?
3756629 3758589 What's left of him.
3758672 3762134 - Can you identify yourself?<br />- Not now. Maybe later.
3762217 3766305 This is a party line.<br />The neighbours got itchy trigger fingers.
3766388 3769850 Here's the deal. You got 30 or so<br />hostages on the 30th floor.
3769934 3771352 The leader's name is Hans.
3771435 3774104 We have to shut him up.<br />He's telling them everything!
3774188 3776273 Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.
3776357 3780819 He can waste as much time as he likes<br />but we must find the bag.
3780903 3784365 - They have a freakin' arsenal here.<br />- We must have the detonators.
3784448 3789536 They got missiles and enough plastic<br />explosives to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.
3789620 3792456 They're down to nine,<br />counting the skydiver you met.
3792539 3797878 These guys are mostly European,<br />judging by their clothing labels, and...
3803801 3805344 cigarettes.
3805427 3807972 They're well-financed and very slick.
3808055 3809723 How do you know that?
3809807 3811558 I've seen enough phoney IDs
3811642 3815479 to recognise the ones they got<br />must have cost a fortune.
3817773 3820192 Add all that up,<br />I don't know what it means,
3820275 3823862 but you got some bad-ass perpetrators<br />and they're here to stay.
3825447 3830411 I hear you, partner. LA's finest are on it,<br />so light 'em if you got 'em.
3830494 3833288 Way ahead of you, partner.
3833831 3835958 So what do I call you?
3837501 3838585 Call me...
3840462 3841296 Roy.
3841380 3846385 Listen up, Roy, if you think of anything else,<br />don't be shy, OK?
3846468 3850431 In the meantime, find a safe place<br />and let us do our job. Understand?
3850514 3852808 They're all yours, Al.
3870284 3872536 Who's talking to 'em?
3872619 3875664 I am, sir. Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.
3876123 3880169 Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?<br />What do these pricks want?
3880252 3884506 If you mean the terrorists,<br />we haven't heard from them.
3884590 3887426 Who have you been talking to?
3887509 3890387 We don't know.<br />He won't give us his name.
3890471 3893057 But he appears to be the one who phoned.
3893140 3896435 He's killed one terrorist<br />and claims he capped off two others.
3896518 3898562 He claims?
3898645 3902483 Powell, has it occurred to you<br />he could be one of the terrorists,
3902566 3904318 or some nutcase in there?
3904401 3907488 I don't think so.<br />In fact, I think he's a cop,
3907571 3910365 maybe not LAPD,<br />but he's definitely a badge.
3910449 3913702 - How do you know that?<br />- A hunch. Things he said...
3913786 3916580 like being able to spot a phoney ID.
3916663 3918749 Jesus Christ, Powell!
3918832 3921335 He could be a bartender for all we know!
3921418 3923796 TV's here.
3923879 3925506 Oh, shit.
3942523 3946443 - I have a request.<br />- What idiot put you in charge?
3946527 3948487 You did...
3948570 3953742 when you murdered my boss.<br />Now everybody's looking to me.
3953826 3958956 Personally, I'd pass on the job.<br />I don't enjoy being this close to you.
3966922 3968257 Go on.
3968340 3970300 We have a pregnant woman.
3970384 3973303 Relax. She's not due for a couple of weeks,
3973387 3976557 but sitting on that rock<br />isn't doing her back any good.
3976640 3981812 So I would like permission to move her<br />to an office with a sofa.
3981895 3984815 No, but I'll have a sofa<br />brought out. Good enough?
3984898 3986692 Good enough.
3986775 3992447 And unless you like it messy, I'd start<br />bringing us in groups to the bathroom.
3992531 3996118 Yes. You're right. It will be done.
3996785 4000164 Was there something else?
4000247 4002249 No, thank you.
4008297 4011967 Mr Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...?
4012050 4014178 Gennero.
4015095 4017431 Ms Gennero.
4020058 4022644 We interrupt this programme<br />for a special bulletin.
4022728 4026607 This is Richard Thornburg<br />live from Century City.
4026690 4031945 Tonight, Los Angeles has joined<br />the sad and worldwide fraternity of cities
4032029 4034031 whose only membership requirement
4034114 4037201 is to suffer the anguish<br />of international terrorism.
4037284 4041663 Approximately two hours ago,<br />an unidentified group of men
4041747 4046752 seized control of the Nakatomi building,<br />sealing off all entrances and exits.
4046835 4051131 All telephone lines have been cut<br />and the only communication now possible
4051215 4054134 has been through the use<br />of CB communicators
4054218 4056595 which the group brought with them.
4056678 4061183 According to official sources,<br />the perpetrators of this building siege...
4061266 4063936 Unit five, hold your position.
4064269 4068315 We got Charlie unit in position<br />by the parking structure.
4068398 4072444 Let me ask you...<br />Does this stairway go up to the escalator?
4072527 4075572 - Yeah.<br />- Tell them to go ahead.
4076281 4078617 What's going on?
4078700 4080869 What's it look like? We're going in.
4080953 4085791 Going in? That's crazy! There could be<br />over 30 hostages in there for all we know.
4085874 4087793 We don't know shit, Powell.
4087876 4091255 If there's hostages, how come<br />there are no ransom demands?
4091338 4094633 If there's terrorists in there,<br />where's their list of demands?
4094716 4096927 All we know is that<br />somebody shot your car up.
4097010 4101306 It's probably the same silly son of a bitch<br />you've been talking to on that radio.
4101390 4103016 Excuse me, sir,
4103141 4106395 but what about the body<br />that fell out the window?
4106478 4109523 - Maybe a stockbroker got depressed.<br />- We're ready.
4109606 4111942 - Light 'em up. Let's go.<br />- Hit your lights.
4112025 4114945 - Blue units, go.<br />- Lights on!
4126873 4129126 Powell?
4129209 4131920 Powell, you still with me, babe?<br />What's going on?
4132629 4133964 Yo, Al.
4134047 4137801 I'm here, Roy, but I'm busy right now.<br />I'll talk to you later.
4137884 4140595 - Al, what's wrong?<br />- I'll talk to you later.
4140679 4145851 If you are what I think you are,<br />you'll know when to listen, shut up, and...
4146852 4148812 and when to pray.
4148895 4151106 Jesus Christ! You're coming in, right?
4152274 4154693 I told you what kind<br />of people you're dealing with!
4154776 4157070 Let's load them up.
4160490 4162951 They'll be coming. Everyone get ready.
4163869 4166496 Theo, you are the eyes now.
4178967 4180260 - Rivers.<br />- Yo.
4180344 4183138 Begin your reconnoitre.
4183764 4185140 Let's go.
4188352 4189936 Shit!
4208872 4211124 Come on. Let's go.
4221134 4222844 Jesus!
4256920 4259339 All right, spread out.
4285198 4287159 Shut up.
4288660 4290537 Let's go.
4295167 4297085 You macho assholes. No! No!
4300046 4301798 All right.
4301882 4303884 Listen up, guys.
4305260 4308472 'Twas the night before Christmas,<br />and all through the house,
4308555 4311016 not a creature was stirring, except
4311099 4315937 the four assholes coming in the rear<br />in standard two-by-two cover formation.
4318356 4319649 We're all set.
4321026 4322986 We're ready.
4323069 4324404 Kick ass.
4324488 4325614 Go!
4325697 4327866 Right. Let's do it.
4343340 4344758 Take cover!
4345175 4346676 They're shooting at 'em.
4346760 4350764 - It's panic fire. They can't see anything.<br />- They're shooting at the lights.
4355060 4358605 They're going after the lights.<br />Call them back.
4359564 4360982 It's not happening.
4361066 4362275 Mike, burn it.
4364528 4366988 Don't be impatient.
4367072 4369241 Just wound them.
4370742 4375288 - Get them back. They're sitting ducks.<br />- They're almost in.
4375413 4378124 Send in the car. Send in the car.
4391596 4392973 Jesus Christ!
4396101 4398853 Rivers, Rodriguez, report.
4398937 4401856 Wait a minute.<br />What have we here, gentlemen?
4405902 4408572 The police have themselves an RV.
4413868 4415203 Southeast corner.
4428300 4430176 Oh, Jesus Christ.
4442105 4444816 Get back! Get the fuck back!
4446610 4447736 Get over there.
4447819 4449237 Schnell! Schnell!
4449321 4451448 Mach schnell!
4454326 4456202 Wetter! Wetter! Wetter!
4456286 4458163 Mach schnell! Mach schnell!
4458246 4459414 Wetter!
4462417 4463960 Mach los! Mach los!
4483938 4484898 I see him!
4496534 4498203 - Feuer!<br />- Clear!
4504209 4507212 Oh, my God! The quarterback is toast!
4507796 4510382 Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.
4511633 4512592 Hit it again.
4512676 4515929 All right, you made your point!<br />Let 'em pull back!
4516012 4518515 Thank you.<br />I'll take it under advisement.
4519224 4520892 Hit it again.
4534364 4535657 Fire.
4550213 4552173 Fuck me.
4552257 4554843 Get them out of the car! They're burning!
4565103 4565729 Fuck it.
4568565 4570233 Mach schnell! Mach los!
4578116 4581745 Let's see you take this<br />under advisement, jerkweed.
4585457 4587375 Geronimo, motherfucker.
4606144 4607145 Oh, shit!
4612442 4616696 - They're using artillery on us!<br />- You idiot, it's not the police.
4616780 4618490 It's him.
4625997 4627290 Holy shit.
4632629 4634631 My God!
4636299 4639219 - Tell me you got that.<br />- I got it.
4640637 4643056 Eat your heart out, Channel 5.
4643181 4647143 We've had an update on the terrorist<br />takeover of the Nakatomi building.
4647227 4651481 Sources say the terrorist leader, Hans,<br />may be this man, Hans Gruber.
4651564 4654484 A member of the radical<br />West German Volksfrei movement.
4654567 4658363 The Volksfrei leadership<br />issued a communiqué an hour ago,
4658488 4661241 stating that Gruber had been<br />expelled from that organisation.
4661324 4663701 Al, do you copy?
4663785 4666037 Are you all right?
4666120 4667497 Yeah, I'm fine.
4668623 4669958 What was that?
4670041 4672961 Remember that plastic explosive<br />I told you about?
4673044 4675964 There you go. Is the building on fire?
4676047 4679551 No, but it's gonna need a paint job<br />and a shitload of screen doors.
4679634 4682387 Our spotter said you got<br />two with that blast.
4682470 4685014 - Is that him?<br />- Yes, sir.
4686641 4689310 I don't know who you think you are,
4689394 4691855 but you just destroyed a building.
4691938 4695024 We do not want your help. Is that clear?
4695108 4696943 We don't want your help.
4697026 4700113 I've got 100 people down here<br />covered with glass.
4700196 4704158 Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?<br />Who the fuck is this?
4705785 4708454 This is Deputy Chief of Police<br />Dwayne T Robinson,
4708538 4710498 and I am in charge of this situation.
4710582 4712375 Oh, you're in charge?
4712458 4714460 I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.
4714544 4717839 From up here it doesn't look<br />like you're in charge of shit.
4717922 4720008 Listen to me, you little asshole...
4720091 4720967 Asshole?
4721050 4724762 I'm not the one who just got buttfucked<br />on national TV, Dwayne.
4726180 4727974 Listen to me, jerk-off,
4728057 4731060 if you're not part of the solution,<br />you're part of the problem.
4731144 4735148 Quit being part of the problem<br />and put the other guy back on!
4737150 4738860 Hey, Roy, how you feeling?
4738943 4740945 Pretty fucking unappreciated, Al.
4741029 4743281 Hey, look. I love you.
4743364 4745575 So do a lot of the other guys.
4745658 4748286 So hang in there, man, you hear me?
4748369 4750288 You hang in there.
4751873 4754334 Yeah, thanks, partner.
4760256 4761633 What are you doing?
4761716 4765511 I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see<br />who gets us killed first,
4765595 4767096 them or your husband.
4767180 4768765 What are you going to do?
4768848 4774270 I negotiate million-dollar deals for breakfast.<br />I think I can handle this Euro trash.
4774354 4777231 Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?
4777315 4780193 If you'd listened to me,<br />he would be neutralised already.
4780276 4783196 I don't want neutral. I want dead.
4783404 4786449 - Hope I'm not interrupting.<br />- What does he want?
4786532 4790203 It's not what I want.<br />It's what I can give you.
4797627 4799963 Look, let's be straight, OK?
4801214 4804676 You're not some dumb schmuck<br />up here to snatch a few purses.
4804759 4806386 You're very perceptive.
4806469 4810974 I watch 60 Minutes.<br />I say to myself, these guys are professional,
4811057 4813476 they're motivated, they're happening.
4813559 4815144 They want something.
4815228 4820358 I couldn't care less about your politics.<br />Maybe you're pissed off at the camel jockeys.
4820441 4823361 Maybe it's Northern Ireland.<br />It's none of my business.
4823444 4826990 - You're here to negotiate, right?<br />- You're amazing.
4827073 4829409 You figured this all out already?
4829492 4831619 Hey, business is business.
4831703 4834956 You use a gun, I use a fountain pen.<br />What's the difference?
4835039 4837625 In my terms,<br />you're here on a hostile takeover.
4837709 4842255 You grab us for some greenmail but didn't<br />expect a poison pill to be running around.
4842338 4843715 Am I right?
4843798 4845341 Hans,
4845425 4848761 bubbee, I'm your white knight.
4849887 4854767 I must have missed 60 Minutes.<br />What are you saying?
4856102 4859313 The guy upstairs<br />who's fucking things up, huh?
4863693 4866446 I can give him to you.
4868281 4870408 Oh, God...
4872493 4874871 Roy? Roy, you all right?
4876122 4879375 Just trying to fire down<br />a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.
4880168 4881669 What do they put in them?
4883129 4887050 Sugar-enriched flour,<br />partially hydrogenated vegetable oil,
4887133 4890344 polysorbate 60, and yellow dye number five.
4890428 4893890 Just everything a growing boy needs.
4893973 4895850 How many kids you got, Al?
4895933 4900021 As a matter of fact,<br />my wife is working on our first.
4900104 4904317 How about you, cowboy?<br />You got any kids back on your ranch?
4905526 4907236 Yeah.
4907320 4908362 Two.
4908821 4912909 Sure hope I can see them swinging<br />on a jungle gym with Al Jr someday.
4915411 4919791 Well, now, that's a date,<br />but you bring the ice cream.
4919874 4922960 Touching, cowboy. Touching.
4923044 4926547 Or should I call you Mr McClane?
4927882 4930510 Mr Officer John McClane
4930593 4933262 of the New York Police Department?
4934847 4937100 Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
4937183 4939519 Get a hold of somebody at Dispatch.
4939602 4944065 Sister Theresa called me<br />Mr McClane in the third grade.
4944148 4948528 My friends call me John,<br />and you're neither, shithead.
4948611 4955118 I have someone who wants to talk to you.<br />A very special friend
4955201 4957787 who was with you at the party tonight.
4963751 4965878 Hey, John boy.
4967171 4968798 Ellis?
4968881 4970216 Yeah.
4970299 4974262 Listen, John, they're giving me<br />a few minutes to talk sense into you.
4974345 4977390 I know you think you're doing your job,
4977473 4980476 but you're dragging this out.
4980560 4984105 No one gets out of here until these guys<br />can talk to the LA police.
4984188 4987608 That won't happen until you stop<br />messing up the works. Capisce?
4993156 4994907 Ellis, what have you told them?
4996367 5001581 That we were old friends<br />and you were my guest at the party.
5001664 5003624 Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.
5003708 5005710 Tell me about it.
5011591 5013301 All right, John, listen.
5014343 5016596 Tell them where the detonators are.
5016679 5018931 They know people are listening.
5019015 5022935 They want the detonators,<br />or they're gonna kill me.
5026480 5027899 John, didn't you hear me?
5030359 5032236 Yeah, I hear you.
5032320 5036866 John, get with the programme!<br />The police are here now. It's their problem.
5036949 5039493 Tell them where the detonators are!
5039577 5042622 I'm putting my life on<br />the line for you, pal!
5042705 5044582 Ellis, listen to me carefully.
5044665 5045333 John...
5045416 5049587 Shut up, Ellis! Just shut your mouth!<br />Put Hans back on the line.
5049670 5054258 Hans, this shithead doesn't know<br />what kind of man you are, but I do.
5054342 5057803 Then you'll give us what we want<br />and save your friend's life.
5057887 5060097 You're not part of this equation.
5060181 5062475 Hey, what am I, a Method actor?
5062558 5065895 Babe, put away the gun.<br />This is radio, not television.
5065978 5069607 Hans, this asshole is not my friend!<br />I don't know him!
5069690 5074737 Jesus Christ, Ellis! These people<br />will kill you! Tell them you don't know me!
5074820 5077240 How can you say that after all these years?
5077323 5081160 John? John?
5104558 5106394 Do you hear that?
5106477 5109272 Talk to me! Where are my detonators?
5109355 5111899 Where are they,<br />or shall I shoot another one?
5111983 5116404 Sooner or later,<br />I might get to someone you do care about.
5116487 5119073 Go fuck yourself, Hans.
5120283 5122368 He just let the guy die.
5122451 5126664 He gave him up. Give me that headset.<br />That's like pulling the trigger yourself.
5126747 5130418 Can't you see what's happening?<br />Can't you read between the lines?
5130501 5132795 He did everything he could to save him.
5132878 5136007 If he gave himself up,<br />they'd both be dead right now!
5136090 5138759 No way, man. They'd be talking to us.
5138843 5142346 You tell this partner of yours<br />to stay out of this from now on.
5142430 5145975 Because if he doesn't,<br />I'm really going to nail his ass.
5146058 5149228 The man is hurting. He is alone, tired,
5149312 5152982 and he hasn't seen diddly-squat<br />from anybody here!
5153065 5155568 You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn
5155651 5158821 about what you do to him<br />if he makes it out of there alive?
5158904 5161824 Why don't you wake up<br />and smell what you shovelling?
5161907 5163534 You listen to me, Sergeant.
5163617 5167246 Any time you want to go home,<br />you consider yourself dismissed.
5167330 5170541 No, sir. You couldn't drag me away.
5170916 5173586 Attention, police.
5173669 5175755 Attention, police.
5175838 5178966 - This is Sergeant Al Powell...<br />- Give me that.
5179050 5182553 This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.<br />Who is this?
5182636 5185348 This is Hans Gruber.
5185431 5188934 I assume you realise the futility<br />of direct action against me.
5189018 5190936 We have no wish for further loss of life.
5191020 5194065 What is it you do wish for?
5194148 5198402 I have comrades in arms<br />around the world languishing in prison.
5198486 5202156 The American State Department<br />enjoys rattling its sabre for its own ends.
5202239 5204283 Now it can rattle it for me.
5205701 5209872 The following people<br />are to be released from their captors.
5209955 5213084 In Northern Ireland,<br />seven members of the New Provo Front.
5213167 5217797 In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders<br />of Liberté de Quebec.
5217880 5221842 In Sri Lanka, the nine members<br />of the Asian Dawn.
5221926 5223427 What the fuck?
5223511 5225346 Asian Dawn?
5225429 5227932 I read about them in Time magazine.
5228015 5231936 When these revolutionary<br />brothers and sisters are free,
5232019 5235231 the hostages in this building<br />will be taken to the roof
5235314 5239985 and they will accompany us in helicopters<br />to LA International Airport
5240069 5244657 where they will be given further instructions.<br />You have two hours to comply.
5244740 5248202 Wait a minute.<br />Mr Gruber. This is crazy.
5248285 5252081 I don't have the authority.<br />Two hours is not enough.
5252164 5254458 Hello? Hello!
5256544 5259713 Did you get all that?<br />We got to make some calls.
5259797 5261924 Do you think they'll even try?
5262007 5264009 Who cares?
5266429 5268597 Theo, are we on schedule?
5268681 5270599 One more to go, then it's up to you.
5270683 5274103 You better be right,<br />because the last one will take a miracle.
5274186 5275771 It's Christmas, Theo.
5275855 5278399 It's the time of miracles,<br />so be of good cheer
5278482 5281277 and call me when you hit the last lock.
5281986 5283028 Karl,
5283112 5286782 hunt that little shit down<br />and get those detonators.
5286866 5288951 Fritz is checking the explosives.
5289034 5291745 I'll check the explosives.<br />You just get the detonators.
5292705 5294165 Hey, Powell, you out there?
5295541 5297334 I'm here, John. I'm here.
5297418 5300921 You gotta believe me.<br />There was nothing I could do.
5302256 5305009 Well, it's gonna be<br />both our asses if you're wrong.
5305092 5307094 I hear you.
5312558 5314977 Did you catch that bullshit<br />Hans was running?
5315060 5317605 It doesn't make sense, man.
5318939 5322943 Don't ask me. I'm just a desk jockey<br />who was on my way home when you rang.
5323027 5326697 The way you drove that car,<br />I figured you for the street, Al.
5326906 5329575 In my youth. In my youth.
5329909 5334997 And author of Hostage Terrorist,<br />Terrorist Hostage, A Study in Duality.
5335080 5338626 Dr Hasseldorf, what can we expect<br />in the next few hours?
5338709 5339502 Well, Gail,
5339585 5344507 the hostages should be going through<br />the early stages of the Helsinki Syndrome.
5344590 5346467 As in Helsinki, Sweden.
5346550 5348135 Finland.
5348219 5351847 Basically, it's when the hostages<br />and the terrorists
5351931 5356769 go through a psychological transference<br />and a projection of dependency.
5356852 5359688 A strange sort of trust and bond develops.
5359772 5364777 We've had situations where the hostages<br />have embraced their captors after release
5364860 5367071 and even corresponded with them in prison.
5367404 5370199 No, no, darling. Asian Dawn. Dawn.
5370282 5373202 D-a-w-n.
5373285 5374787 - Sir?<br />- Yeah?
5374870 5376789 Sir, the FBI is here.
5376872 5380668 - The FBI is here now?<br />- Yes, sir. Right over there.
5380751 5382086 Hold this.
5382169 5384421 Want a breath mint?
5388425 5390803 How you doin', man?
5390886 5393514 I'm Agent Johnson.<br />This is Special Agent Johnson.
5393597 5396934 - Oh, how you doing?<br />- No relation.
5397017 5398352 I'm...
5399770 5403607 I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.<br />I'm in charge here.
5403691 5405734 Not any more.
5460497 5464043 Hi, there. How you doing?
5470007 5473177 Please, God. No.<br />You're one of them, aren't you?
5473260 5474762 You're one of them.
5474845 5477723 No! Don't kill me! Please!
5477806 5480267 Don't kill me, please! Please, please!
5480351 5483145 Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
5483228 5484897 I'm not gonna hurt you!
5487441 5489068 Oh, God.
5492529 5495741 What are you doin' up here?<br />What were you lookin' for?
5495824 5498243 I managed to get out of there and...
5498327 5501455 I was just trying to get up on the roof...
5501538 5504249 and see if I could signal for help.
5505751 5507878 It's through here. Come and help.
5507961 5511090 Hold it. Forget the roof.
5511799 5514635 Forget the roof.<br />They got people all over it.
5516053 5518514 You wanna stay alive, you stay with me.
5521350 5523435 The best we can figure it,
5523519 5527022 we've got maybe 30 or 35 hostages up there,
5527106 5529024 probably on the 30th floor,
5529108 5532736 and maybe seven or eight<br />terrorists up there.
5532820 5534988 Sounds like an A-7 scenario.
5535072 5537491 Thank you. We'll handle it from here.
5537574 5540369 When we commandeer your men,<br />we'll try and let you know.
5540452 5543539 - Aren't you forgetting something?<br />- Such as?
5543622 5548502 What about John McClane?<br />He's the reason we have any information.
5548585 5552214 He's also the reason<br />you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.
5552297 5554633 He's inside? Who is he?
5554717 5557636 He might be a cop. We're checking on that.
5557720 5560389 - One of yours?<br />- No, no way.
5565936 5566770 You smoke?
5568313 5569815 Yeah.
5574528 5575738 Thanks.
5579616 5582494 You don't work for Nakatomi.
5586790 5589668 And if you're not one of them...
5591754 5594214 I'm a cop from New York.
5595090 5596675 New York?
5596759 5598677 Yeah.
5598761 5601597 Got invited to<br />the Christmas party by mistake.
5601680 5602973 Who knew?
5611607 5615652 Better than being caught<br />with your pants down, huh?
5622993 5625704 I'm John McClane.
5625788 5627289 You're...
5628665 5630334 Clay.
5632294 5633629 Bill Clay.
5639718 5641845 Know how to use a handgun, Bill?
5643222 5647601 I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.<br />That game with the guns that shoot red paint.
5647684 5649937 Probably seems stupid to you.
5651355 5652564 Nope.
5655651 5658487 Time for the real thing, Bill.
5665994 5668872 All you got to do is pull the trigger.
5668956 5669540 Come on.
5677881 5682261 33. Stockwerk. Kommt sofort.
5688976 5693272 Put down the gun<br />and give me my detonators.
5697734 5699736 Well, well, well.
5701113 5702155 Hans.
5703198 5705742 Put it down now.
5709329 5712833 That's pretty tricky with that accent.
5712916 5716128 You oughta be on fuckin'<br />TV with that accent.
5718422 5722050 But what do you want with the detonators?
5722134 5724803 I already used all the explosives.
5727139 5729850 Or did I?
5729933 5734062 - I'm going to count to three.<br />- Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?
5735188 5735856 Oops.
5737774 5739109 No bullets.
5739192 5742279 What, do you think<br />I'm fucking stupid, Hans?
5742362 5743280 You were saying?
5798126 5799503 Karl.
5799586 5801672 Schieß auf das Fenster.
5808387 5810305 Shoot the glass!
5843630 5845132 Jesus Christ!
5874411 5877372 Smile, Karl. We're back in business.
5879958 5883045 Is the last resort of diplomacy,
5883128 5889801 then couldn't we say that terrorism<br />has an equal claim on being that too?
5889885 5892012 Tell me you got something.
5892095 5896058 McClane's name, badge number,<br />employment record, vital statistics,
5896141 5898643 and his family's home address...
5898727 5900145 right here in LA.
5908320 5909654 Go to work.
5909738 5911531 Got it.
5923668 5926922 God, that man looks really pissed.
5929216 5931510 He's still alive.
5931593 5933887 What?
5933970 5937808 Only John can drive somebody that crazy.
5953782 5958078 Hans, heat up that miracle because<br />we just broke through on number six,
5958161 5960914 and the electromagnetic<br />came down like an anvil.
5960997 5966336 Have a look at what our friends<br />outside are doing and I'll be right up.
5968755 5972425 Hey, John.<br />John McClane, you still with us?
5972509 5974344 Yeah.
5974427 5978765 But all things being equal,<br />I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
5978849 5981226 Chalk up two more bad guys.
5981309 5984896 The boys down here will<br />be glad to hear that.
5984980 5986857 We got a pool going on you.
5986940 5988817 What kind of odds am I getting?
5988900 5990569 You don't want to know.
5990652 5993321 Put me down for 20. I'm good for it.
5997242 5999911 Hey, pal, you got flat feet?
6002414 6004624 What the hell you talking about, man?
6004708 6007127 Something had to get you off the street.
6007210 6011756 What's the matter? You don't think<br />a deskjob is a noble effort for a cop?
6013675 6015343 No.
6018388 6020432 I had an accident.
6020515 6023602 The way you drive, I can see why.<br />What'd you do?
6023685 6026271 Run over your captain's foot with the car?
6030150 6032861 I shot a kid.
6032944 6035947 He was 13 years old.
6036031 6040076 It was dark. I couldn't see him.<br />He had a ray gun, looked real enough.
6043330 6047083 When you're a rookie, they teach you<br />everything about being a cop
6047167 6049085 except how to live with a mistake.
6053089 6057886 Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself<br />to draw my gun on anybody again.
6060931 6062933 Sorry, man.
6063767 6066478 Hey, man, how could you know?
6068813 6070649 I feel like shit anyway.
6073652 6080033 Well, this won't matter. The LAPD is<br />not calling the shots down here any more.
6082494 6084162 The Feds?
6084246 6085330 You got it.
6086915 6089209 Those are the city engineers.
6090418 6091920 Wait.
6092003 6094714 They're going into the street circuits.
6094798 6097008 The guys in suits,<br />I don't know who they are.
6097092 6098843 That's the FBI.
6098927 6102514 They're ordering the others<br />to cut the building's power.
6102597 6104557 Regular as clockwork.
6106434 6108436 Or a time lock.
6108520 6110272 Precisely.
6110355 6114150 The circuits that cannot be cut<br />are cut automatically
6114234 6116987 in response to a terrorist incident.
6117070 6119197 You asked for miracles, Theo.
6119281 6122409 I give you the FBI.
6123535 6127706 - I want the building shut down.<br />- I got a switch...
6127789 6132669 I don't care about your switch.<br />I want it out. Dark! D-a-r-k.
6132752 6134296 You can't do it from here.
6134379 6136798 - Yeah, you could.<br />- It can't be done from here.
6136881 6138591 I could... I got the radio...
6138675 6142137 You can't do it from here.<br />It's got to be done from downtown.
6142220 6146099 They've gotta take out a whole city grid.<br />We're talking 10 blocks.
6146182 6150020 Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.<br />There's thousands of people...
6150103 6152439 You have to go wider.
6152522 6157610 - I need authorisation.<br />- How about the United States government?
6157694 6159738 Lose the grid, or you lose your job.
6165910 6167746 - Yeah, Central?<br />- Yeah?
6167829 6170165 This is Walt, down at Nakatomi.
6170248 6175170 Would it be possible for you<br />to turn off grid 212?
6175253 6176379 Are you crazy?!
6176463 6179132 Maybe I should call the mayor.
6179215 6182302 No shit it's my ass.<br />I got a big problem here.
6182385 6184763 Shut it down now.
6188058 6190810 Emergency lighting activated.
6190894 6193730 Al, talk to me. What's going on here?
6193813 6195357 Ask the FBI.
6195440 6200653 They got the universal terrorist playbook<br />and they're running it step by step.
6202781 6206076 It's gonna go. It's gonna go!
6206493 6207911 Yes!
6230809 6232894 Merry Christmas.
6233812 6238942 - They must be pissing in their pants.<br />- The mayor is gonna have my ass.
6260171 6262424 What are we gonna do now?
6262507 6267429 - Arrest them for not paying their electric bill?<br />- We've shut them down.
6267512 6270974 We let them sweat for a while,<br />then give them helicopters.
6271057 6273268 Right up the ass.
6275854 6277397 This is Agent Johnson.
6277480 6278857 No, the other one.
6278940 6282235 I want air support<br />ready to lift off in five minutes.
6282318 6285780 Damn right. Fully armed. We're on the way.
6291703 6293580 Oh, yes!
6295290 6297709 I wish to talk to the FBI.
6300295 6302422 This is Special Agent Johnson.
6302505 6306968 The State Department has arranged<br />for the return of your comrades.
6307051 6309679 Helicopters are en route as you requested.
6309762 6312015 I hear you. We'll be ready.
6312098 6314517 When he figures out what hit him,<br />he'll be in a body bag.
6315393 6318271 When they touch down, we'll blow the roof.
6318354 6324402 By the time they figure it all out,<br />we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.
6331075 6332869 Powell?
6332952 6334787 Yo, Powell, you got a minute?
6336539 6338249 I'm here, John.
6339959 6343505 Listen, I'm starting<br />to get a bad feeling up here.
6343588 6345507 I want you to do something for me.
6348426 6352347 I want you to find my wife.<br />Don't ask me how. By then you'll know how.
6352430 6359103 I want you to tell her something.<br />I want you to tell her that...
6366027 6368696 Tell her it took me a while to figure out
6368780 6370865 what a jerk I've been,
6371449 6373451 but...
6374369 6375370 that...
6379249 6381960 that when things started<br />to pan out for her,
6382043 6386422 I shoulda been more supportive.
6386506 6387382 And...
6388883 6392053 I just should have been behind her more.
6394597 6396599 Oh, shit.
6398518 6400645 Tell her that...
6401521 6406150 that she's the best thing<br />that ever happened to a bum like me.
6408069 6411698 She's heard me say I love you<br />a thousand times.
6412699 6416661 She never heard me say I'm sorry.
6416744 6424252 I want you to tell her that, Al.<br />Tell her that John said that he was sorry.
6424335 6426254 OK?
6426337 6427505 You got that, man?
6427589 6429841 Yeah, I got it, John.
6431175 6434012 But you can tell her that yourself.
6434095 6438182 You just watch your ass<br />and you'll make it out. You hear me?
6438266 6440643 I guess that's up to the man upstairs.
6444022 6445523 John?
6446357 6448192 John?
6448276 6451821 What the fuck<br />were you doing upstairs, Hans?
6453448 6454449 John?
6454532 6457702 No, Al, listen. Just lay off for a while.
6459704 6462457 I gotta go check on something.
6465335 6467754 One minute, that's all I'm asking.
6467837 6469714 One minute to speak to them.
6469797 6471799 All right. Get back. Get back.
6471883 6474302 All right, look.
6474385 6478514 You let me in right now,<br />or I call the INS, comprende?
6481059 6486314 This is the last time these kids<br />are gonna have to speak to their parents.
6487315 6488691 All right?
6488775 6490735 All right. Come on. Come on.
6501037 6504707 What were you doing, Hans?<br />What were you doing?
6527271 6530441 Jesus, Mary, mother of God.
6533903 6536531 Al, listen to me! It's a double-cross!
6536614 6538241 The roof is wired to...
6540952 6541994 John?
6544372 6545915 John!
6546249 6548042 John, come in!
6548126 6552255 - Did you get that?<br />- Something about a double-cross.
6552338 6554632 Tell me about it.
6560346 6562598 We are both professionals.
6564726 6567645 This is personal.
6590126 6592879 They're coming!
6592962 6594839 Choppers are coming.
6594922 6598259 Time to gather your flock, Miss Gennero.
6598342 6602388 Your mom and dad<br />are very important people.
6602472 6604474 They're very brave people.
6604557 6608561 Is there something you'd like<br />to say to them, if they're watching?
6608644 6611773 Come home.
6620281 6621574 Mrs McClane.
6624869 6628790 How nice to make your acquaintance.
6631417 6633419 On your feet, everyone! To the roof!
6633503 6636172 Lock them up there and come right back.
6664951 6669247 You should have heard your brother squeal<br />when I broke his fucking neck!
6672583 6675002 What do you figure the breakage?
6675086 6681008 I figure we take out the terrorists,<br />lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.
6681092 6683553 I can live with that.
6683636 6685429 Get this thing on the deck.
6685513 6688558 They're expecting transports, not gunships.
6700403 6702405 Move it! Come on! Move!
6702488 6704073 Come on! Come on!
6704156 6706534 Move it!
6706617 6707869 Go! Move!
6711747 6713165 Theo.
6713249 6714834 A little bonus for us.
6714917 6716878 Please, sit down. Sit down!
6716961 6719714 A policeman's wife might come in handy.
6719797 6722300 McClane, I have some news for you.
6723301 6724635 McClane?
6736105 6737398 Move!
6740067 6740818 Come on!
6753623 6755958 Motherfucker! I'll kill you!
6759879 6761339 Armed.
6761422 6763466 - The truck?<br />- The truck.
6770640 6774685 After all your posturing,<br />all your little speeches,
6774769 6777271 you're nothing but a common thief.
6777355 6779857 I am an exceptional thief, Mrs McClane.
6779941 6785071 And since I'm moving up to kidnapping,<br />you should be more polite.
6790701 6792828 You motherfucker!
6792912 6796374 I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,<br />and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!
6818896 6821065 I don't like this, Sarge.
6828781 6834704 Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?
6836247 6839083 I was in junior high, dickhead.
6867028 6868487 Where's Holly?
6868571 6870031 Where's Holly Gennero?
6870114 6872199 Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?
6872283 6874160 Where's Holly? Where is she?
6874243 6875536 - They took her!<br />- Where?
6875619 6876662 The vault!
6876746 6878998 - Where is the vault?<br />- The 30th floor!
6879081 6881000 They just took her!
6881208 6883294 Get downstairs!
6883419 6886547 The whole fucking roof<br />is wired to blow! Get down!
6886630 6889258 Get down! Get the fuck downstairs!
6891427 6894346 They made us, Bureau.<br />You got a terrorist shooting hostages.
6894430 6896140 I see him! Break left!
6902396 6904065 Nail that sucker!
6912156 6915242 I'm on your side, you assholes!
6915326 6918454 Swing around again!<br />I'll bag this little bastard.
6937348 6939183 What the fuck...
6941143 6944021 Oh, John, what the fuck are you doing?
6944105 6946982 How the fuck did you get into this shit?
6956951 6960371 There's something wrong!<br />They're coming back down!
6960454 6962623 - Blow the roof.<br />- But Karl's up there!
6962706 6964166 Blow the roof!
6967378 6973384 I promise I will never even think<br />about going up in a tall building again.
6976720 6979056 Oh, God, please don't let me die!
7070689 7073150 Holy Christ!
7074318 7076987 We're gonna need<br />some more FBI guys, I guess.
7089750 7091543 Jesus fucking Christ!
7092503 7093629 Fuck!
7118028 7120531 What the fuck is going on?
7122449 7127621 What are you gonna do?<br />Sit here while the building falls down?
7134378 7135254 Shit!
7135337 7137214 All right!
7138674 7139883 Hey! Hey!
7140843 7142636 Hang on, baby.
7142720 7144305 Hang on, honey.
7145347 7146390 Oh, God.
7191518 7193228 Hans!
7207743 7209495 Jesus.
7209578 7212790 Hi, honey.
7233894 7238232 So that's what this was all about?<br />A fuckin' robbery?
7238315 7241151 Put down the gun.
7241235 7243529 Why'd you have to nuke the whole building?
7243612 7246657 Well, when you steal $600,<br />you can just disappear.
7246740 7249743 When you steal 600 million,<br />they will find you,
7249827 7252079 unless they think you're already dead.
7252162 7254331 Put down the gun.
7264800 7267469 Nein. This is mine.
7269680 7271557 You got me.
7271640 7276186 Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.<br />Americans all alike.
7276270 7280232 This time, John Wayne does not walk off<br />into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
7280315 7284027 - That was Gary Cooper, asshole.<br />- Enough jokes.
7284111 7286947 You'd have made a pretty<br />good cowboy yourself, Hans.
7287030 7291785 Oh, yes. What was it<br />you said to me before?
7291869 7295664 Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
7316727 7317728 Holly!
7323317 7324818 Happy trails, Hans.
7369488 7371365 I hope that's not a hostage.
7399768 7403772 Gimme water hook-ups<br />for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.
7407442 7409528 Over here. It's a better angle.
7413740 7416785 Keep it going, now. Keep it going.
7421832 7425460 - Come on. We're going to miss it!<br />- OK. Hand me my notes!
7448483 7452571 What was it like in there?<br />How did they treat you?
7498784 7502537 Al, this is my wife Holly.<br />Holly Gennero.
7503288 7505040 Holly McClane.
7505123 7506792 Hello, Holly.
7506875 7511505 You got yourself a good man.<br />You take good care of him.
7511588 7512923 McClane!
7513298 7515842 McClane, I want a debriefing!
7515926 7518637 You got some things to answer for, mister.
7518720 7524351 Ellis' murder, for one thing. Property damage,<br />interfering with police business.
7564683 7567769 Go inside,<br />see if there's anybody else!
7578488 7581116 No. This one's with me.
7591001 7592669 Mr McClane, Mr McClane!
7592753 7597674 Now that it's all over and after this<br />incredible ordeal, what are your feelings?
7602596 7604014 Well, well, well.
7604097 7608351 - Merry Christmas, Argyle.<br />- Merry Christmas.
7611897 7612939 Did you get that?
7615525 7620363 If this is their idea of Christmas,<br />I gotta be here for New Year's.
