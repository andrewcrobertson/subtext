55573 58926 You don't like flyin', do you?
58950 62078 What gives you that idea?
63247 67811 You wanna know the secret<br />to surviving air travel?
67835 71065 After you get where you're going,<br />take off your shoes and your socks.
71089 75925 Then you walk around on the rug barefoot<br />and make fists with your toes.
76886 79114 Fists with your toes?
79138 81575 I know, I know. It sounds crazy.
81599 83660 Trust me. I've been doin' it<br />for nine years.
83684 86789 Yes, sir. Better than a shower<br />and a hot cup of coffee.
86813 89564 Okay.
99158 101284 It's okay. I'm a cop.
103913 107351 Trust me. I've been<br />doin' this for 11 years.
107375 109936 On behalf of your captain and crew...
109960 112689 we'd like to welcome you<br />to Los Angeles.
112713 115131 Have a very Merry Christmas.
124350 129706 Flight 247 to Tucson<br />now boarding at Gate 14.
129730 134609 Flight 247 to Tucson<br />now boarding at Gate 14.
137363 141616 Mr. Edward Machowski,<br />please report to the white courtesy phone.
147080 149059 Ah.
149083 151334 How do you do?
163430 167452 Ladies and gentlemen!<br />Ladies and gentlemen!
167476 170122 I want to congratulate<br />each and every one of you...
170146 174649 for making this one of the greatest years<br />in the history of the Nakatomi Corporation.
178112 183385 On behalf of the chief executive officer,<br />Mr. Ozu, and the board of directors...
183409 188037 we thank you, one and all, and wish you<br />a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year!
191792 195439 Hey, Holly, what about<br />dinner tonight, huh?
195463 197941 Harry, it's Christmas Eve.
197965 201217 Families, stockings.
202260 204239 Chestnuts.
204263 206408 Rudolph and Frosty.
206432 208452 Any of these things ring a bell?
208476 213332 Actually, I was thinkin' more of<br />mulled wine, a nice aged Brie...
213356 215334 and a roaring fireplace.
215358 218151 You know what I'm sayin'?
220196 223592 Ginny, it's 5:40. Go join the party.<br />Have some champagne.
223616 226220 You're makin' me feel<br />like Ebenezer Scrooge.
226244 229890 Thanks a lot, Ms. Gennero. Do you<br />think the baby can handle a little sip?
229914 232809 That baby's ready to tend bar.
232833 234853 Last chance.
234877 237962 Bye.
242510 245739 McClane residence.<br />Lucy McClane speaking.
245763 250160 Hello, Lucy McClane.<br />This is your mother speaking.
250184 253246 Mommy! When are you coming home?
253270 257626 Pretty soon. Pretty soon.<br />You'll be in bed when I get there though.
257650 260212 Let me talk to Paulina, okay, hon?
260236 264383 And no snoopin' around the house<br />looking for presents.
264407 267116 Is Daddy coming home with you?
269078 273225 Well, we'll see what<br />Santa and Mommy can do, okay?
273249 275310 Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.
275334 277502 Paulina!
282383 284361 Hola, Mrs. Holly.
284385 287656 Um, did Mr. McClane call?
287680 291368 No, Mrs. Holly. No telefonó.
291392 294371 Well, he probably just didn't<br />have time before his flight.
294395 298458 Um, it might be a good idea<br />to make up the spare bedroom just in case.
298482 301211 Sí, Mrs. Holly.<br />I do that already.
301235 303987 What would I do<br />without you, Paulina?
329013 331180 California.
341817 343795 Excuse me.
343819 345881 Hey, I'm John McClane.
345905 349032 Argyle. I'm your limo driver.
351035 353369 Nice bear.
357458 361772 Okay, Argyle. What do we do now?
361796 364274 I was, uh, hopin' you could tell me.
364298 366693 It's my first time drivin' a limo.
366717 369905 Oh, that's okay. It's my<br />first time ridin' in one.
369929 372783 Relax. We got everything<br />in this mug, man.
372807 376286 Look at this - CD, C.B., TV...
376310 380248 telephone, full bar, VHS.
380272 383941 If your friend's hot to trot, I know a<br />few mama bears we can hook up with.
385778 388340 - Or is he married?<br />- He's married.
388364 390615 Okay.
391492 394805 Oh, sorry about that.<br />It's the girl's day off.
394829 397808 I didn't know you were<br />gonna sit up front.
397832 399851 So, uh, your lady live out here?
399875 401978 About the past six months.
402002 405065 Meaning you still live in New York.
405089 408485 You always ask this<br />many questions, Argyle?
408509 412261 Sorry, man. I used to drive a cab, and, uh,<br />people would expect a little chitchat.
413180 416493 - So, you divorced?<br />- Just drive the car, man.
416517 420645 Hey, come on. You divorced?<br />You separated? She beat you up?
423649 427336 He had a good job.<br />Turned into a great career.
427360 430256 Ah, that meant she had to move here.
430280 432509 You're very fast, Argyle.
432533 435451 So why didn't you come?
437455 440289 Well, why didn't you come<br />with her, man? What's up?
441542 443520 'Cause I'm a New York cop.
443544 445579 I got a six-month backlog of New York<br />scumbags
445603 447023 I'm still trying to put behind bars.
447047 449234 I can't just pick up<br />and go that easy.
449258 451736 In other words, you thought<br />she wasn't gonna make it out here...
451760 453738 and she'd come crawling<br />on back to you...
453762 456366 so why bother to pack, right?
456390 458785 Like I said,<br />you're very fast, Argyle.
458809 461144 You mind if we hear some tunes?
464148 467817 Hey, that'll work.
468903 471006 Don't you got any Christmas music?
471030 474157 This is Christmas music.
502853 506500 So your lady sees you, you run into<br />each other's arms, the music comes up...
506524 509211 and you live happily<br />ever after, right?
509235 512214 I can live with that.
512238 515759 So if it doesn't work out, man,<br />you got a place to stay?
515783 519262 - I'll find a place.<br />- I tell you what.
519286 521973 I'm gonna pull in<br />the parking garage and I'll wait.
521997 524266 You score, you give me a call<br />on the car phone.
524290 526269 I'll take your bags to the desk.
526293 528646 You strike out,<br />I'll get you a hotel.
528670 530899 You're all right, Argyle.
530923 534050 Just remember that<br />when you sign for the tip.
556990 558969 Hi.
558993 561846 - Good evening.<br />- I'm here to see Holly McClane.
561870 564121 Just type it in there.
569003 571273 Cute toy.
571297 574924 Yeah. You have to take a leak,<br />it'll even help you find your zipper.
590899 593150 Christ.
597573 599634 13th floor.
599658 602636 The party. They're the only ones<br />left in the building.
602660 606516 Take the express elevator.<br />Get off where you hear the noise.
606540 608708 Thanks.
665974 668893 - Champagne, sir?<br />- Yeah. Thanks.
703637 705615 Oh, I'm sorry.
705639 708391 Hey! Merry Christmas!
711310 715959 Jesus. Fuckin' California.
715983 718169 I couldn't agree with you more.
718193 720403 Why don't I talk to him right now?
721363 723341 Hi. I'm looking for, uh -
723365 725343 - Holly Gennero.<br />- Yeah.
725367 726944 Then you must be John McClane.
726968 728722 - Joe Takagi.<br />- Hi.
728746 730806 - How was your ride in?<br />- Nice.
730830 734185 - I have you to thank for that?<br />- It seemed the least we could do.
734209 736186 It's quite a place you have here.
736210 738273 It will be<br />if we ever get it finished.
738297 740442 There are still several<br />floors under construction.
740466 744112 Holly went to the vault room to fax some<br />documents. She should be back any minute.
744136 746762 In the meanwhile,<br />her office is right back here.
748766 751225 Ellis.
753060 756249 I was just makin' a call,<br />and this was, uh, the nearest phone.
756273 759942 I want you to meet<br />John McClane, Holly's husband.
761236 764924 Holly's policeman. Ellis is in charge<br />of international development.
764948 767343 Heard a heck of a lot about you.
767367 769577 Missed some.
771413 776019 Uh, could I get you anything? Food,<br />cake, uh, some watered-down champagne?
776043 779105 No, thank you. I'm fine.
779129 782108 You throw quite a party.
782132 784861 I didn't realize they<br />celebrated Christmas in Japan.
784885 789680 Hey, we're flexible. Pearl Harbor didn't<br />work out, so we got you with tape decks.
792184 794803 Actually, it's kind of sort of a double<br />celebration.
794827 796039 We, uh, closed a pretty big deal today.
796063 797999 And a lot of it was due to Holly.
798023 799876 - Am I right, Jo-Jo?<br />- Go ahead without me.
799900 802777 I'll be about 4 minutes.
805656 807907 John.
810910 812889 Have you met everyone?
812913 815225 No, we've been sticking him<br />with spears.
815249 817393 Of course he has.
817417 820104 She was made for the business.<br />Tough as nails.
820128 824025 - Yeah.<br />- I was hoping you made that flight.
824049 826694 Show him the watch.
826718 827753 Later.
827777 829989 Well, go on. Show him.<br />What, are you embarrassed?
830013 834118 It's just a small token<br />of appreciation for all her hard work.
834142 836204 It's a Rolex.
836228 838248 I'm sure I'll see it later.
838272 840583 Is there a place<br />where I could wash up?
840607 843317 Sure.
858458 861710 You'll have to forgive Ellis.<br />He gets very depressed this time of year.
863005 865984 He thought he was<br />God's greatest gift, you know?
866008 868278 Yeah, I know the type.
868302 871446 I think he's got his eye on you.
871470 875451 It's okay. I have my eye<br />on his private bathroom.
875475 877620 Where you staying?
877644 881541 Things happened so fast, I didn't<br />get a chance to ask you on the phone.
881565 885295 - Cappy Roberts retired out here.<br />- Oh, yeah?
885319 888506 - Told me I could bunk in with him.<br />- Cappy retired, huh?
888530 890758 - Where's he live?<br />- "Ramona."
890782 892926 Pomona.
892950 895596 - Huh?<br />- Pomona.
895620 898516 - Pomona.<br />- Yeah.
898540 902020 God, you'll be in the car<br />half the time.
902044 905648 Why don't we make it easy?<br />I have a spare bedroom.
905672 908568 I mean, it's not huge<br />or anything, but...
908592 912261 the kids would love<br />to have you at the house.
913013 916390 They would, huh?
918018 920455 I would too.
920479 922999 Oh! Ooh!
923023 925274 Sorry.
932074 934783 I missed you.
940958 943102 I guess you didn't miss<br />my name, though, huh?
943126 947148 Except maybe when<br />you're signing checks?
947172 949465 Since when did you<br />start using "Ms. Gennero"?
952469 955740 This is a Japanese company. They<br />figure a married woman's got one foot -
955764 957992 You are a married woman, Holly.<br />You're married to me.
958016 960954 Are we gonna have this conversation again?<br />We did this in July.
960978 963246 - We never finished this conversation in July.<br />- I had an opportunity.
963270 965666 - I had to take it.<br />- Right. No matter what the consequences...
965690 967876 no matter what it did to our marriage,<br />you had to.
967900 970922 It didn't do anything except maybe change<br />your idea of what our marriage should be.
970946 973925 I don't think you have a clue what my idea<br />of our marriage should be.
973949 976469 I know exactly what your idea<br />of our marriage should be.
976493 978494 Ms. Gennero, I -
979997 983832 - Excuse me.<br />- Hi.
984835 987021 Um, Mr. Takagi is looking for you.
987045 989581 He-He wants you to say<br />something to the troops.
989605 990673 Thank you.
995053 999932 Speech time.<br />Be back in a few minutes.
1010777 1013006 That's great, John.
1013030 1015614 Good job. Very mature.
1065165 1068311 So Kareem rebounds, right?<br />Feeds Worthy on the break.
1068335 1071754 Over to A.C., to Magic,<br />then back to Worthy, right?
1072964 1075674 Boom! Two points.
1078260 1080429 We're in.
1229996 1232247 Left.
1234250 1237085 Right, and again left.
1267242 1270035 Son of a bitch.
1272038 1274206 Fists with your toes.
1305113 1307091 Yeah, Argyle.
1307115 1310176 - Hey, Mac! How's it goin' up there?<br />- Oh, all right. Where are you?
1310200 1313222 I'm kickin' it in the garage. What's<br />the word with you and your lady, man?
1313246 1315789 Uh, the vote's not in yet.
1324424 1326861 - Hey Brother.<br />- Just a moment.
1326885 1329052 No, no... not yet, just wait...
1346488 1348466 Argyle?
1348490 1351366 Mac, you there? Hello?
1359750 1362210 You know the number. Use it!
1454012 1459099 Stay calm. Everything's gonna be fine.<br />Everything's gonna be fine.
1477785 1480036 Shit!
1483124 1485834 Think. Think.
1502100 1508231 Ladies and gentlemen.
1514989 1519094 "Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's<br />legacy of greed around the globe...
1519118 1523663 "they're about to be taught a lesson<br />in the real use of power.
1524790 1527083 You will be witnesses."
1529045 1531065 Now...
1531089 1533256 where is Mr. Takagi?
1535677 1539949 Joseph Yoshinobu Takagi.
1539973 1542451 Born, Kyoto, 1937.
1542475 1544453 Don't move.
1544477 1550084 Family emigrated<br />to San Pedro, California, 1939.
1550108 1554630 Interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43.
1554654 1559635 Scholarship student,<br />University of California...

1578177 1580489 Vice Chairman,<br />Nakatomi Investment Group.
1580513 1582722 Enough.
1583683 1587329 And father of five.
1587353 1589604 I am Takagi.
1590607 1592585 How do you do?
1592609 1595193 It's a pleasure to meet you.
1607206 1610500 Computers. 32, construction.<br />33, computers.
1623264 1625473 Nice suit.
1626267 1628768 John Philips, London.
1630563 1632833 I have two myself.
1632857 1636151 Rumor has it Arafat buys his there.
1640698 1643450 - In there?<br />- On the left. On the left.
1665890 1670579 "And when Alexander saw the<br />breadth of his domain, he wept...
1670603 1674022 for there were no more<br />worlds to conquer."
1677985 1681215 Benefits of a classical education.
1681239 1685575 Oh, that's beautiful.
1686828 1689806 I always enjoyed to make models<br />when I was a boy.
1689830 1695020 The exactness, the attention<br />to every conceivable detail.
1695044 1697022 It's beautiful.
1697046 1700215 Is this what this is all about?<br />Our project in Indonesia?
1701426 1703904 Contrary to what you people may think...
1703928 1707282 we're going to develop that region,<br />not exploit it.
1707306 1712811 I believe you.<br />I read the article in Forbes.
1714147 1717126 Mr. Takagi.
1717150 1720504 I could talk about industrialization<br />and men's fashions all day...
1720528 1722631 but I'm afraid work must intrude...
1722655 1726969 and my associate, Theo,<br />has some questions for you.
1726993 1730412 Sort of fill-in-the-blanks<br />questions, actually.
1739589 1742359 I don't have that code.
1742383 1745821 You broke in here<br />to access our computer?
1745845 1748714 Any information you could get, when<br />they wake up in Tokyo in the morning,
1748738 1749450 they'll change it.
1749474 1752119 You won't be able to blackmail<br />our executives, threaten our profit -
1752143 1754769 Sit down!
1764197 1768575 Mr. Takagi, I'm really<br />not interested in your computer.
1773122 1777519 But I need the code key<br />because I am interested...
1777543 1781606 in the $640 million<br />in negotiable bearer bonds...
1781630 1784693 that you have locked in your vault.
1784717 1788762 And the computer controls the vault.
1789680 1792034 You want money?
1792058 1794726 What kind of terrorists are you?
1797855 1800482 Who said we were terrorists?
1808115 1811720 Mr. Takagi, I sympathize<br />with your reluctance...
1811744 1816475 but I'm sure you realize you're not dealing<br />with anything significant here.
1816499 1819561 It's not as if it's<br />the education of your children.
1819585 1822396 The bonds represent, at most...
1822420 1825901 10 days operating capital<br />for your parent organization.
1825925 1828986 It's really no more than<br />a temporary inconvenience.
1829010 1831179 Now...
1835184 1837162 the code, please.
1837186 1839373 It's useless to you.
1839397 1843043 There are seven safeguards on our vault,<br />and the code key is only one of them.
1843067 1844352 You'll never get it open.
1844376 1847130 Then there's no<br />reason not to tell it to us.
1847154 1849132 I told you.
1849156 1851616 It's not over yet.
1856205 1860143 That's a very nice suit, Mr. Takagi.
1860167 1862877 It would be a shame to ruin it.
1866173 1868694 I'm going to count to three.
1868718 1872489 There will not be a four.
1872513 1875723 Give me the code.
1876475 1878685 One.
1879979 1882230 Two.
1884025 1886128 - Three.<br />- I don't know it, I'm telling you.
1886152 1888630 Get on a jet to Tokyo<br />and ask the chairman.
1888654 1890756 I'm telling you, you're just gonna<br />have to kill me.
1890780 1893241 Okay.
1896162 1899725 We'll do it the hard way.<br />Tony, see if you can dispose of that.
1899749 1903293 Karl, you'd better go and check on<br />Heinrich's work up on the machine floor.
1927485 1929463 Nothing.
1929487 1931863 See to Heinrich.
1933490 1938472 Now, you can break the code?
1938496 1942707 You didn't bring me along<br />for my charming personality.
1947922 1952778 Argyle, tell me you heard the shots<br />and you're callin' the police right now.
1952802 1956448 Of course I'm still comin' by later.
1956472 1959242 Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?
1959266 1962143 My boss? He thinks<br />I'm on my way to Vegas.
1962895 1966291 Uli, get up on the pipes.
1966315 1968816 Marco, you go through here.
1969652 1971630 I'll throw you the cord.
1971654 1973905 Yeah.
1975490 1977992 Hans, we're on the roof.
1990756 1993007 Here.
1995886 1998137 Uli!
2004562 2009209 Thirty minutes to break the code.<br />Two hours - two and a half hours...
2009233 2011836 for the five mechanicals,<br />at the minimum.
2011860 2014737 The seventh lock, however,<br />is out of my hands.
2037428 2039990 - I'm sorry.<br />- The 7th lock.
2040014 2045059 The electromagnetic seal. You do understand<br />the circuits cannot be cut locally.
2046479 2048855 Trust me.
2049648 2052317 Why the fuck didn't you<br />stop 'em, John?
2053569 2056631 'Cause then you'd be<br />dead too, asshole.
2056655 2059032 Think, goddamn it. Think!
2070878 2072856 We've got a fire alarm.
2072880 2074858 Call 911.
2074882 2079279 Give them the guard's name, the<br />building code number and cancel the alarm.
2079303 2081804 Then disable the system.
2084016 2087143 Eddie, on what floor<br />did the alarm go off?
2088270 2090582 Now? Should we go?
2090606 2092774 Nein.
2102868 2107038 Yes. Oh, baby,<br />come to papa. Come on.
2107790 2109957 Ah!
2111752 2114856 Baby. Come on, baby.<br />Come on, baby.
2114880 2117799 Come to papa.<br />I'll kiss your fuckin' dalmatian.
2120886 2123865 Oh, you stupid motherfuckers!<br />No! No!
2123889 2126641 Turn the fuckin' truck around!
2159340 2162969 The fire has been<br />called off, my friend.
2166724 2169517 No one is coming to help you.
2173355 2176983 You might as well come out<br />and join the others.
2179278 2181904 I promise I won't hurt you.
2210476 2214246 Drop it, dickhead.<br />It's the police.
2214270 2218210 - You won't hurt me.<br />- Oh, yeah? Why not?
2218234 2222339 Because you're a policeman.<br />There are rules for policemen.
2222363 2226199 Yeah. That's what<br />my captain keeps tellin' me.
2237169 2239378 Drop that, motherfucker!<br />I'll fuckin' kill you!
2245302 2248262 Come on! Come on!<br />I'll fuckin' rip your head off?
2292099 2295017 You bet your ass I wish to proceed.
2335100 2336677 Nine million terrorists in the world,
2336701 2338990 and I gotta kill one with<br />feet smaller than my sister.
2389822 2394386 I wanted this to be professional,<br />efficient, adult, cooperative.
2394410 2398473 Not a lot to ask. Alas, your Mr. Takagi<br />did not see it that way...
2398497 2402541 so he won't be joining us<br />for the rest of his life.
2404210 2407440 So we can go any way you want us.
2407464 2410485 You can walk out of here<br />or be carried out.
2410509 2414970 But have no illusions.<br />We are in charge.
2415973 2418891 So, decide now, each of you.
2419685 2422269 And, please remember...
2423105 2426190 we have left nothing to chance.
2434366 2437451 Get them back!
2445043 2447837 "Now I have a machine gun.
2449506 2452800 Ho-ho-ho."
2455554 2457656 A security guard we missed?
2457680 2459993 They're usually tired old policemen<br />growing fat on a pension.
2460017 2461995 No, no. This is something else.
2462019 2465604 Oh, they're gonna kill us!
2467733 2472630 What did I tell you?
2472654 2475884 - We have to do something, Hans.<br />- Yes, we do.
2475908 2480430 We have to tell Karl his brother is dead.<br />Tell him to come down.
2480454 2483099 - Karl?<br />- Yeah?
2483123 2485101 Karl, come down right away!
2485125 2488271 Franco, you and Fritz take<br />the body upstairs and out of sight.
2488295 2490940 I don't want the hostages<br />to think too much.
2490964 2493340 Come down right now... quickly...
2555279 2557924 - I want blood!<br />- You'll have it.
2557948 2561176 But let Heinrich plant the detonators<br />and Theo prepare the vault.
2561200 2563555 After we call the police,<br />they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...
2563579 2566140 and then you can tear the building apart<br />looking for this man.
2566164 2569102 But until then,<br />we do not alter the plan.
2569126 2571961 And if he alters it?
2576508 2578926 What do ya think?
2580470 2582656 Something's wrong.
2582680 2584701 Cops?
2584725 2586703 John.
2586727 2589455 John? Aw, Christ.
2589479 2592208 He could fuck this whole thing up.<br />What does he think he's doin'?
2592232 2594669 - His job.<br />- Bullshit.
2594693 2596838 His job's 3,000 miles away.
2596862 2598840 Without him, we still have a chance.
2598864 2601634 We might be able to get outta here.
2601658 2604326 Tell that to Takagi.
2627476 2629996 Mayday! Mayday!<br />Anyone copying? Channel 9.
2630020 2632040 Terrorists have seized<br />the Nakatomi building...
2632064 2634083 and are holding at least<br />30 people hostage.
2634107 2637253 I repeat, unknown number<br />of terrorists, six or more...
2637277 2640715 armed with automatic weapons<br />at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.
2640739 2643426 - Where's the best place to transmit?<br />- Somebody answer me, goddamn it!
2643450 2646619 The roof! Go! Go!
2648497 2651016 It's the same address as that fire signal.
2651040 2653292 I'll handle it.
2655379 2659233 Attention, whoever you are. This channel's<br />reserved for emergency calls only.
2659257 2662843 No fuckin' shit, lady.<br />Do I sound like I'm orderin' a pizza?
2675440 2678108 No one kills him but me.
2678985 2681089 They have already<br />killed one hostage.
2681113 2684425 They are fortifying their positions<br />while you're jerkin' me off on the radio!
2684449 2686426 Now, send a police backup A.S.A.P.!
2686450 2688763 Sir, I've already told you,<br />this is a reserved channel.
2688787 2692642 If this is an emergency call,<br />dial 911 on your telephone.
2692666 2696104 Otherwise, I'll have to report<br />this as an F.C.C. violation.
2696128 2698773 Fine, report me!<br />Come the fuck down here and arrest me!
2698797 2701651 Just send the police now!
2701675 2703425 Ow!
2707097 2710224 Whoa!
2713603 2717231 See if there's a black-and-white<br />that can do a drive-by.
2728994 2730972 I thought you guys<br />just ate doughnuts.
2730996 2733599 They're for my wife.
2733623 2735643 Yeah.
2735667 2739188 - She's pregnant.<br />- Yeah.
2739212 2742066 Bag it.
2742090 2744216 Big time.
2746762 2749013 Thanks.
2751349 2753828 Dispatch to 8-Lincoln-30, over.
2753852 2755830 This is 8-Lincoln-30.<br />Come on in, over.
2755854 2759709 Investigate a code 2<br />at Nakatomi Plaza, Century City.
2759733 2764111 8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.<br />I'm on my way.
2794059 2796935 Christ!
2882480 2884458 Girls.
2884482 2887359 In the attic...
2899289 2902749 Shit. Where the fuck is it?
2923730 2925981 Oh, my God.
2932113 2934774 - Hans, we have a machine gun...<br />- Have you found him?
2934798 2936363 He's in the furnace area of the roof...
2939245 2941599 - He's in the furnace area of the roof...<br />- Where is Karl?
2941623 2944185 - He's in the elevator shaft.<br />- Did you hear that?
2944209 2947480 Perfect. The elevators are<br />locked off. He can't escape.
2947504 2949671 Just shut him in and come back down.
2953176 2955719 Oh, fuck.
2960433 2965020 Karl, the police are probably<br />on their way already. Karl!
2985875 2988043 Christ.
2992298 2994694 I can stall them,<br />but not if they hear gunshots.
2994718 2997469 If you lock him in, he'll be neutralized
3062744 3066246 "Come out to the coast.<br />We'll get together, have a few laughs."
3073213 3076965 Now I know what<br />a TV dinner feels like.
3143533 3145992 Karl, come! Police! Hurry...
3192540 3194791 It's about time.
3200006 3202443 No signs of disturbance, Dispatch.
3202467 3206094 8-L-30, roger. Possible crank call.<br />Check the area again and confirm.
3211643 3214895 Who's driving this car,<br />Stevie Wonder?
3217106 3220753 I do see a guard inside.<br />I'm gonna go in for a closer look.
3220777 3223028 8-L-30, Roger. Use caution.
3225698 3230035 - Eddie?<br />- I had a feeling you'd be callin'.
3253393 3256102 Good evenin', officer.<br />What can I do for you?
3259816 3265067 - How many are there? - Just one man.<br />- Someone is "jumping the gun".
3267323 3269468 We had that false alarm, you know?
3269492 3273806 Ask me, that god-damn computer<br />sent you out on another wild goose chase.
3273830 3277268 They've been chasing bugs in this<br />system ever since they installed it.
3277292 3281438 - Notre Dame on top of USC.<br />- Aw, shit!
3281462 3284256 Come on. I got 50 bucks<br />bet on them assholes.
3285675 3290011 Come on. Come on.<br />Where's the fucking cavalry?
3298730 3306730 He's on the 34th floor. Go, hurry.
3313036 3315596 It was good for 52 yards.
3315620 3317891 You don't mind if I take<br />a look around, do you?
3317915 3320476 No, help yourself.
3320500 3325380 Seven to nothing, Notre Dame.<br />The Irish driving 74 yards in eight plays-
3327216 3331155 This fucking -<br />Freeze, motherfucker! Drop it!
3331179 3332255 - Don't! Don't!<br />- Put that fucking gun down!
3332279 3333532 Put the gun down!
3333556 3336243 - Okay! Don't shoot!<br />- Drop the fucking gun!
3336267 3338018 Marco, duck!
3354452 3357621 Aw, the hell with this.
3364462 3367232 You are done!
3367256 3370361 No more table.<br />Where are you going, pal?
3370385 3374888 Next time you have<br />a chance to kill someone, don't hesitate.
3382063 3383999 Thanks for the advice.
3384023 3386001 Sorry to waste your time.
3386025 3388003 No problem at all.
3388027 3390737 - Merry Christmas.<br />- Merry Christmas to you.
3404794 3407379 Oh, for the love of -
3410550 3413153 - 8-Lincoln-30 to Dispatch.<br />- 8-L-30, go ahead.
3413177 3415781 Yeah, that's a wild goose chase<br />over here at Nakatomi Plaza.
3415805 3418932 Everything here's okay. Over.
3427483 3430443 Damn! Goddamn it!<br />Jesus H. Christ!
3436826 3439054 Welcome to the party, pal!
3439078 3441121 Goddamn it!
3447420 3449898 Now means now, goddamn it!
3449922 3452109 Policeman under automatic<br />rifle fire at Nakatomi!
3452133 3454194 I need backup assistance now!
3454218 3457095 Now, goddamn it! Now!
3475280 3478010 Monica, I can get us a table.
3478034 3480012 Wolfgang and I<br />are very close friends.
3480036 3482014 Officer in need of assistance.
3482038 3484141 - I interviewed him.<br />- Reports of shots fired at Nakatomi.
3484165 3486143 2000 block, Avenue of the Stars.
3486167 3488353 Repeat, officer<br />needs assistance at -
3488377 3491606 I'm in Nakatomi Plaza.<br />They're turning my car into Swiss cheese!
3491630 3495967 I need backup assistance now!<br />Now, goddamn it! Now!
3516739 3518759 I never thought I'd love<br />to hear that sound.
3518783 3523388 All of you, relax. This is a matter<br />of inconvenient timing, that's all.
3523412 3525556 Police action was inevitable...
3525580 3528435 and, as it happens, necessary.
3528459 3532064 So let them fumble about<br />outside and stay calm.
3532088 3534233 This is simply the beginning.
3534257 3538654 I thought I told all of you<br />I want radio silence until further-
3538678 3541406 Oh, I'm very sorry, Hans.<br />I didn't get that message.
3541430 3544868 Maybe you should have<br />put it on the bulletin board.
3544892 3547371 I figured since I waxed Tony and Marco<br />and his friend here...
3547395 3550249 I figured you and Karl and Franco<br />might be a little lonely.
3550273 3552416 So I wanted to give you a call.
3552440 3554692 How does he know so much about -
3556320 3558632 That's very kind of you.
3558656 3562511 I assume you are<br />our mysterious party crasher.
3562535 3565973 You are most troublesome<br />for a security guard.
3565997 3568892 Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.
3568916 3573336 Would you like to go for "Double Jeopardy"<br />where the scores can really change?
3577008 3579194 Hmm. These are very bad for you.
3579218 3581613 Who are you then?
3581637 3585450 Just a fly in the ointment, Hans.<br />A monkey in the wrench.
3585474 3588268 A pain in the ass.
3589562 3592583 Whoa.
3592607 3595126 Check on all the others.<br />Don't use the radio.
3595150 3599571 See if he's lying about Marco,<br />and find out if anyone else is missing.
3602950 3605285 Mr. Mystery Guest...
3606454 3608640 are you still there?
3608664 3613145 Yeah, I'm still here. Unless you<br />wanna open the front door for me.
3613169 3615146 No, I'm afraid not.
3615170 3617858 But you have me at a loss.
3617882 3619860 You know my name, but who are you?
3619884 3624948 Just another American who saw<br />too many movies as a child?
3624972 3629036 Another orphan of a bankrupt culture<br />who thinks he's John Wayne?
3629060 3631913 Rambo? Marshal Dillon?
3631937 3635166 I was always kind of partial<br />to Roy Rogers actually.
3635190 3637169 I really liked those sequin shirts.
3637193 3640653 Do you really think you have<br />a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy?
3642823 3646159 Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.
3649580 3651073 I can get the jump on everybody
3651097 3652684 - if I get a remote.<br />- I don't have the new pages.
3652708 3656229 - Where's the Gladden report?<br />- Harvey, keep your pants on, will you?
3656253 3657413 Sam, look, I'm begging you.
3657437 3659733 Simon's already at a remote thing<br />with that Santa sing-along.
3659757 3662486 - I'll tell him to swing by.<br />- I'm not sitting on this for Simon!
3662510 3664488 - I don't wanna hear it!<br />- This is my story!
3664512 3666990 - I can't hear you.<br />- All right, look. Sam, I tell you what.
3667014 3669910 You don't wanna give me a truck,<br />I'll go and I'll steal a truck.
3669934 3672496 - Give us a break, Thornburg.<br />- Eat it, Harvey!
3672520 3676583 Four, three, two, one.
3676607 3679359 Harvey, we're on the air.
3682780 3684989 Good evening.<br />This is Harvey Johnson.
3686784 3690722 And I'm Gail Wallens, and this is<br />Nightline News at 10:00.
3690746 3693516 Our top stories<br />on this Christmas Eve-
3693540 3696626 Take truck number five<br />and get out of here.
3703592 3707948 He wasn't lying about Marco.<br />He's down on the street.
3707972 3710200 And the other man was Heinrich.
3710224 3713017 And his bag is missing.
3714437 3716938 But he had the detonators.
3719567 3721734 Theo.
3722570 3725298 - Theo.<br />- Yo!
3725322 3728199 We may have some problems.<br />How's our schedule?
3729660 3734349 - Three down, four to go.<br />- Then don't waste time talking to me.
3734373 3737894 This is Sergeant Al Powell<br />of the Los Angeles Police Department.
3737918 3740605 If the person who radioed for help<br />can hear me on this channel...
3740629 3743734 acknowledge this transmission.
3743758 3747154 I say again, if the person who radioed<br />for help on this channel can hear me...
3747178 3749887 acknowledge this transmission.
3754059 3756621 I read you, Powell.<br />You the guy in the car?
3756645 3758665 What's left of him.
3758689 3762711 - Can you identify yourself?<br />- Not now. Maybe later.
3762735 3766423 Listen fast. This is a party line, and<br />the neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.
3766447 3769926 All right, here's the deal. You got<br />30 or so hostages on the 30th floor.
3769950 3773072 - The leader, his name is Hans.<br />- We have to find him and shut him up.
3773096 3774697 - He's telling them everything!<br />- Let him.
3774721 3776290 I'm waiting for the<br />FBI to arrive. Until then,
3776314 3781062 he can waste as much time as<br />he likes, but we must find the bag.
3781086 3784441 - Fritz, go help Uli. We must have the detonators.<br />- They got an arsenal up here.
3784465 3787068 They got missiles, automatic weapons...
3787092 3789154 and enough plastic explosives<br />to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.
3789178 3793074 They're down to nine now,<br />countin' the skydiver you met.
3793098 3797351 These guys are mostly European,<br />judging by their clothing labels and...
3803818 3805796 cigarettes.
3805820 3808048 They're well-financed<br />and very slick.
3808072 3809523 Well how do you know that?
3809547 3811635 I've seen enough phony ID's in my time...
3811659 3815078 to recognize that the ones they got<br />must've cost a fortune.
3817832 3820352 Add all that up, I don't know<br />what the fuck it means.
3820376 3824128 But you got some badass perpetrators,<br />and they're here to stay.
3825630 3828443 I hear you, partner.<br />L.A.'s finest are on it.
3828467 3832470 - So light 'em if you got 'em.<br />- Way ahead of you, partner.
3833973 3836224 So what do I call you?
3837560 3841373 Call me... Roy.
3841397 3843375 Well, listen up, Roy.
3843399 3846670 If you think of anything else you think<br />we need to know, don't be shy, okay?
3846694 3849548 In the meantime, find a safe place<br />to hole up and let us do our job.
3849572 3852865 - Understand?<br />- They're all yours, Al.
3870384 3872904 All right, who's talking to 'em?
3872928 3876616 I am, sir.<br />Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.
3876640 3880161 Dwayne Robinson, Powell. What's the<br />deal here? What do these pricks want?
3880185 3882998 Well, if you mean the terrorists, sir,<br />we don't exactly know.
3883022 3885000 We haven't heard a peep from them.
3885024 3887711 Well, who in the hell<br />have you been talking to?
3887735 3890672 We don't know that either, sir.<br />He won't give us his name.
3890696 3893174 But he appears to be the one<br />who phoned in the report.
3893198 3896595 He's killed one terrorist for sure,<br />and he claims he's capped off two others.
3896619 3898805 He claims?
3898829 3902559 Has it occurred to you he could be<br />one of the terrorists pulling your chain?
3902583 3904811 Or some nutcase in there?
3904835 3907564 I don't think so, sir.<br />In fact, I think he's a cop.
3907588 3910332 Maybe not LAPD, but<br />he's definitely a badge.
3910356 3911568 How do you know that?
3911592 3914613 A hunch. Things he said...
3914637 3917240 like being able to spot a phony ID
3917264 3921411 Jesus Christ, Powell! He could be<br />a fucking bartender for all we know.
3921435 3925771 - TV's here.<br />- Oh, shit.
3935950 3938326 I'm not gonna warn you again.
3942080 3944059 I have a request.
3944083 3948563 - What idiot put you in charge?<br />- You did...
3948587 3950899 when you murdered my boss.
3950923 3952901 Now everybody's looking to me.
3952925 3958262 Personally, I'd pass on the job.<br />I don't enjoy being this close to you.
3966355 3968333 Go on.
3968357 3970376 We have a pregnant woman out there.
3970400 3973380 Relax. She's not due<br />for a couple of weeks.
3973404 3976549 But sitting on that rock<br />isn't doing her back any good.
3976573 3980284 So I would like permission to move her<br />to one of the offices where there's a sofa.
3982079 3984849 No, but I'll have a sofa<br />brought out to you. Good enough?
3984873 3986893 Good enough.
3986917 3990503 And unless you like it messy, I'd start<br />bringing us in groups to the bathroom.
3992464 3996152 Yes, you're right.<br />It will be done.
3996176 3999178 Was there something else?
4000305 4002515 No. Thank you.
4008647 4011357 - Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs.<br />-
4012400 4015130 Gennero.
4015154 4018239 Miss Gennero.
4020242 4022721 We interrupt this program<br />for a special news bulletin.
4022745 4026808 This is Richard Thornburg,<br />live from Century City.
4026832 4028976 Tonight, Los Angeles has joined...
4029000 4032022 the sad and worldwide<br />fraternity of cities...
4032046 4034024 whose only membership requirement...
4034048 4037276 is to suffer the anguish<br />of international terrorism.
4037300 4041740 Approximately two hours ago,<br />an unidentified group of men...
4041764 4044366 seized control<br />of the Nakatomi building...
4044390 4046786 sealing off all entrances and exits.
4046810 4048830 All telephone lines have been cut.
4048854 4051206 And the only communication<br />now possible...
4051230 4054461 has been through the use<br />of C.B. communicators...
4054485 4056671 which the group<br />apparently brought with them.
4056695 4061259 According to official sources,<br />the perpetrators-
4061283 4064136 Unit Five, hold your<br />position at the main entrance.
4064160 4068766 All right, guys, we got Charlie Unit<br />in position by the parking structure.
4068790 4072312 Let me ask you something.<br />Does this stairway go up to the escalator?
4072336 4074439 - Yeah. That's where they're going.<br />- Tell them to go ahead.
4074463 4075581 Through the lobby up there
4075605 4078651 - and try and draw some fire.<br />- What's going on?
4078675 4080820 What's it look like?<br />We're going in.
4080844 4083490 Goin' in? Man, that's crazy!
4083514 4086034 There could be over 30 hostages in there<br />for all we know.
4086058 4088661 We don't know shit, Powell.<br />If there's hostages...
4088685 4091372 how come nobody's come to us<br />with ransom demands?
4091396 4095168 If there's terrorists in there,<br />where's their list of demands?
4095192 4097336 All we know is that<br />somebody shot your car up.
4097360 4101341 It's probably the same silly son of a bitch<br />you've been talking to on that radio.
4101365 4105470 Excuse me, sir, but what about the body<br />that fell out the window?
4105494 4108515 Well, who knows? It was probably<br />some stockbroker who got depressed.
4108539 4111016 - We're ready for you, Chief.<br />- All right, light 'em up. Let's go.
4111040 4113520 - All right, hit your lights.<br />- Blue Unit, go.
4113544 4116253 - We got approval, Chief.<br />- Lights on!
4117756 4119340 Down a little.
4127057 4129285 Al.
4129309 4131955 Al, you still with me, babe?<br />What's going on?
4131979 4134040 Yo, Al?
4134064 4137876 I'm here, Roy. I'm kind of busy right now.<br />I'll talk to you later.
4137900 4140672 - What's wrong? What's going on?<br />- I said I'll talk to you later.
4140696 4143515 If you are what I think you are,<br />then you'll know when to listen,
4143539 4146160 when to shut up, and--
4146384 4148888 And when to pray.
4148912 4151182 Jesus Christ. You're coming in.<br />That's it, isn't it?
4151206 4154769 Christ, Powell, I told you what kind<br />of people you're dealing with here.
4154793 4157336 - All right, let's load 'em up.<br />- Blue, go.
4160090 4162986 So, they'll be coming.<br />Everyone get ready.
4163010 4167012 Theo, you are the eyes now.
4178984 4180962 - Rivers!<br />- Yo!
4180986 4183756 Begin your reconnoiter.
4183780 4186031 Let's go!
4187950 4190411 Shit!
4208889 4211640 Hey, come on. Let's go!
4220900 4223068 Ow! Jesus.
4256937 4259188 All right, spread out.
4285257 4288194 Shut up.
4288218 4290469 Let's go!
4295142 4297309 You macho assholes. No! No!
4300063 4303107 All right. Listen up, guys.
4305569 4308923 'Twas the night before Christmas,<br />and all through the house...
4308947 4311092 not a creature was stirring,<br />except...
4311116 4314136 the four assholes<br />coming in the rear...
4314160 4316161 in standard two-by-two<br />cover formation.
4318707 4321060 Okay, we're all set.
4321084 4323479 We're ready.
4323503 4325690 - Kick ass.<br />- Go!
4325714 4327965 Right. Let's do it.
4343357 4346753 - Take cover!<br />- They're shootin' at 'em!
4346777 4348880 It's panic fire.<br />They can't see anything.
4348904 4351030 They're shootin' at the lights.
4355494 4358871 They're going after the lights.<br />Pull 'em back.
4360165 4362541 - It's not happening.<br />- Mike, burn it.
4364544 4366272 Don't be impatient.
4366296 4369435 Just wound them.
4370759 4371293 Get 'em back.
4371317 4373279 - They're sittin' ducks up there without lights.<br />- No, no, they're almost in.
4373303 4376616 - Get 'em back!<br />- They're almost in. Send in the car.
4376640 4378515 Send in the car.
4391613 4394365 Jesus Christ!
4396118 4398930 Rivers, Rodriguez, report.
4398954 4402081 Whoa! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.<br />What have we here, gentlemen?
4405919 4408796 The police have themselves an R.V.
4413885 4416512 Southeast corner.
4417347 4420015 Hurry...
4428233 4430442 Oh, Jesus Christ.
4442122 4445082 Out of here! Get back!<br />Get the fuck back!
4446626 4449962 - Get over there!<br />- Hurry.
4452052 4456302 Shit - Leave it. Move on.
4483370 4485164 I see him!
4491170 4492838 - Ready?<br />- Just a moment.
4504226 4507246 Oh, my God!<br />The quarterback is toast.
4507270 4509415 - All right, all right!<br />- Get them out of the car. Let's go!
4509439 4512668 - Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.<br />- Hit it again.
4512692 4516005 Hans, you motherfucker, you<br />made your point! Let 'em pull back!
4516029 4519091 Thank you, Mr. Cowboy.<br />I'll take it under advisement.
4519115 4521158 Hit it again.
4533505 4535881 Fire.
4550230 4552250 Fuck me.
4552274 4555084 Let's go! Get 'em out of the car.<br />Don't you know they're burning?
4564286 4566764 Fuck it.
4566788 4568747 Bring the other one over here.<br />Hurry.
4578174 4581969 Let's see you take this<br />under advisement, jerk-weed.
4584680 4587599 Geronimo, motherfucker!
4606160 4609663 Oh, shit!
4612042 4614103 They're using artillery on us!
4614127 4618755 You idiot.<br />It's not the police. It's him.
4625347 4627514 Holy shit.
4632646 4634980 My God.
4636316 4640588 - Tell me you got that.<br />- I got it. I got it.
4640612 4643132 Eat your heart out, Channel Five.
4643156 4647178 We've had an update on the terrorist<br />takeover of the Nakatomi building.
4647202 4651515 Sources say the terrorist leader, Hans,<br />may be this man, Hans Gruber...
4651539 4654976 a member of the radical<br />West German Volksfrei movement.
4655000 4658648 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership<br />issued a communiqué an hour ago...
4658672 4661316 stating that Gruber had been<br />expelled from that organization.
4661340 4665236 - Al, do you copy?<br />- Are you all right?
4665260 4668616 Yeah, I'm fine.
4668640 4670743 What-What was that?
4670767 4672552 Remember that plastic<br />explosive I told you about?
4672576 4674304 - Yeah.<br />- There you go.
4674328 4676040 Is the building on fire?
4676064 4680211 No, but it's gonna need a paint job<br />and a shitload of screen doors.
4680235 4682254 Our spotters say<br />you got two with that blast.
4682278 4684256 Is that him? Is that him?
4684280 4686258 - Yes, sir.<br />- Give me that.
4686282 4689636 You listen to me, mister. I don't know<br />who in the hell you think you are...
4689660 4691931 or what you're doing,<br />but you just destroyed a building!
4691955 4697103 Now, we do not want your help.<br />Is that clear? We don't want your help.
4697127 4700272 I've got 100 people down here,<br />and they're covered with glass.
4700296 4704383 Glass? Who gives a shit about glass?<br />Who the fuck is this?
4705885 4708406 This is Deputy Chief of Police<br />Dwayne T. Robinson...
4708430 4710574 and I am in charge<br />of this situation.
4710598 4714536 Oh, you're in charge? Well, I got some<br />bad news for you, Dwayne.
4714560 4717873 From up here it doesn't look like<br />you're in charge of jack shit.
4717897 4721001 You listen to me, you<br />little asshole. I'm - - Asshole?
4721025 4725172 I'm not the one who just got butt-fucked<br />on national TV, Dwayne.
4725196 4728050 Now, you listen to me, jerk-off.
4728074 4730553 If you're not part of the solution,<br />you're part of the problem.
4730577 4734121 Quit being part of the fucking problem<br />and put the other guy back on!
4736916 4738894 Hey, Roy. How you feelin'?
4738918 4741396 Pretty fuckin' unappreciated, Al.
4741420 4745693 Hey, look. I love you.<br />So do a lot of the other guys.
4745717 4750554 So you hang in there, man.<br />You hear me? You hang in there.
4752182 4754933 Yeah, thanks, partner.
4759355 4761834 What are you doing?
4761858 4765421 I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see<br />who gets us killed first -
4765445 4767423 them or your husband.
4767447 4769425 What are you going to do?
4769449 4771719 Hey, babe, I negotiate<br />million-dollar deals for breakfast.
4771743 4774722 I think I can handle<br />this Euro-trash. Hey.
4774746 4777308 Sprechen sie talk? Huh?
4777332 4780186 If you listened to me,<br />he would be neutralized already.
4780210 4784106 I don't want neutral. I want dead.
4784130 4786525 - Hope I'm not interrupting.<br />- What does he want?
4786549 4790469 It's not what I want.<br />It's what I can give you.
4798060 4800039 Look, let's be straight, okay?
4800063 4804752 It's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck<br />up here to snatch a few purses. Am I right?
4804776 4808380 - You're very perceptive.<br />- I watch 60 Minutes.
4808404 4812176 I say to myself, "These guys are<br />professional, they're motivated...
4812200 4815179 they're happening,<br />i.e. they want something."
4815203 4818098 Now, personally, I couldn't care less<br />about your politics.
4818122 4820309 Maybe you're pissed off<br />at the camel jockeys.
4820333 4823270 Maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland.<br />It's none of my business.
4823294 4825815 I figure you're here to negotiate.<br />Am I right?
4825839 4829443 You're amazing.<br />You figured this all out already?
4829467 4833781 Hey, business is business.<br />You use a gun. I use a fountain pen.
4833805 4836325 What's the difference?<br />Let's put it in my terms.
4836349 4838953 You're here in a hostile takeover,<br />you grab us for some greenmail...
4838977 4842331 but you didn't expect some poison pill was<br />gonna be running around in the building.
4842355 4843999 Am I right?
4844023 4849027 Hans, Bubbe, I'm your white knight.
4850613 4853907 I must have missed 60 Minutes.<br />What are you saying?
4856286 4859704 The guy upstairs<br />who's fucking things up? Huh?
4863793 4866211 I can give him to you.
4868339 4870674 Oh, God!
4872719 4875095 Roy! Roy, you all right?
4876472 4880744 Just trying to fire down<br />a thousand-year-old Twinkie
4880768 4883414 What do they put<br />in these things, anyway?
4883438 4887376 Sugar-enriched flour,<br />partially hydrogenated vegetable oil...
4887400 4890963 polysorbate 60<br />and yellow dye number five.
4890987 4893966 Just everything a growing boy needs.
4893990 4895968 How many kids you got, Al?
4895992 4900055 Well, as a matter of fact,<br />my wife is working on our first.
4900079 4904416 How about you, cowboy?<br />You got any kids back on your ranch?
4906002 4908772 Yeah. Two.
4908796 4912985 I sure hope I can see 'em swinging<br />on a jungle gym with Al Jr. someday.
4913009 4917489 Well, now, that's a date.
4917513 4920075 But, uh, you're gonna have<br />to bring the ice cream.
4920099 4923162 Touching, cowboy. Touching.
4923186 4928000 Or should I call you Mr. McClane?
4928024 4930586 Mr. Officer John McClane...
4930610 4933320 of the New York Police Department.
4934322 4937176 - Get on the phone to Harry in New York.<br />- Got it.
4937200 4939595 Better get ahold<br />of somebody at Dispatch.
4939619 4944350 Sister Theresa called me<br />Mr. McClane in third grade.
4944374 4946435 My friends call me John.
4946459 4948793 You're neither, shithead.
4950797 4953192 I have someone<br />who wants to talk to you -
4953216 4955194 a very special friend...
4955218 4958011 who was with you<br />at the party tonight.
4963893 4966144 Hey, John Boy.
4967355 4971418 - Ellis?<br />- Yeah. Now, listen, John.
4971442 4974338 They're givin' me a few minutes<br />to try to talk some sense into you.
4974362 4977466 I know you think you're doing your job,<br />and I can appreciate that...
4977490 4979635 but you're just<br />dragging this thing out.
4979659 4982388 Now, look, no one gets out of here<br />until these guys...
4982412 4984390 can talk to the L.A. police...
4984414 4987832 and that just ain't gonna happen until<br />you stop messing up the works, capisce?
4992964 4995173 Ellis, what have you told them?
4996467 5001656 I told them we were old friends,<br />and you were my guest at the party.
5001680 5003659 Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.
5003683 5006768 Tell me about it.
5011357 5013335 All right, John, listen.
5013359 5016964 They want you to tell them<br />where the detonators are.
5016988 5019716 They know people are listening.
5019740 5023201 They want the detonators<br />or they're gonna kill me.
5025955 5028164 John, didn't you hear me?
5030334 5032312 Yeah, I hear you.
5032336 5034940 John, I think you could get<br />with the program a little, huh?
5034964 5036942 The police are here now.<br />It's their problem.
5036966 5039820 Now tell these guys where the detonators<br />are so no one else gets hurt.
5039844 5042865 I'm putting my life<br />on the line for you, pal.
5042889 5045409 - Ellis, listen to me very carefully.<br />- John -
5045433 5049663 Shut up, Ellis! Just shut your mouth!<br />Put Hans back on the line.
5049687 5054668 Hans, this shithead does not know what<br />kind of man you are, but I do. Listen -
5054692 5057713 Good. Then you'll give us what we want<br />and save your friend's life.
5057737 5060382 You're not part of this equation.<br />It's time you realized that.
5060406 5062551 Hey, what am I,<br />a method actor, Hans?
5062575 5066305 Babe, put away the gun.<br />This is radio, not television.
5066329 5068974 Hans, this asshole is not my friend.<br />I just met him tonight.
5068998 5071769 I don't know him. Jesus Christ, Ellis,<br />these people are gonna kill you!
5071793 5074730 Tell them you don't know me!
5074754 5077316 John, how can you say that<br />after all these years?
5077340 5082093 John? John?
5103366 5106428 Do you hear that?
5106452 5109348 Talk to me!<br />Where are my detonators?
5109372 5111975 Where are they,<br />or shall I shoot another one?
5111999 5115794 Sooner or later, I might get to someone<br />you do care about.
5116587 5118880 Go fuck yourself, Hans.
5120299 5122569 Did you hear that?<br />He just let the guy die, man.
5122593 5125196 He just gave him up.<br />Give me that headset.
5125220 5127199 - That's like pulling the trigger yourself.<br />- Christ, man.
5127223 5129952 Can't you see what's happening?<br />Can't you read between the lines?
5129976 5131954 - Is this on the right channel?<br />- Yes, sir.
5131978 5133996 He did everything he could to save him.
5134020 5136250 If he gave himself up,<br />they'd both be dead right now.
5136274 5138710 No way, man. No way.<br />They'd be talking to us.
5138734 5140394 Listen, you tell this<br />partner of yours, pal,
5140418 5142464 to stay the hell out of this<br />from now on, you hear me?
5142488 5143230 Because if he doesn't,
5143254 5146552 I'm gonna nail him. Boy, I'm really<br />gonna nail his ass now. Believe me.
5146576 5149680 The man is hurtin'.<br />He is alone, tired...
5149704 5153058 and he hasn't seen diddly-squat<br />from anybody down here.
5153082 5155060 Now, you're gonna<br />stand there and tell me...
5155084 5158896 he's gonna give a damn about what you'll do<br />to him if he makes it out of there alive?
5158920 5161900 Why don't you wake up<br />and smell what you're shoveling?
5161924 5163902 You listen to me, Sergeant.
5163926 5167156 Anytime you wanna go home,<br />you consider yourself dismissed.
5167180 5170868 No, sir.<br />You couldn't drag me away.
5170892 5173704 Attention, police.
5173728 5175789 Attention, police.
5175813 5179001 - This is Sergeant Al Powell -<br />- Give me that.
5179025 5182588 This is, uh - This is, uh,<br />Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson. Who is this?
5182612 5185756 This is Hans Gruber.
5185780 5188594 I assume you realize the futility<br />of direct action against me.
5188618 5190971 We have no wish<br />for further loss of life.
5190995 5194099 Well, uh, what is it you do wish for,<br />Mr. Gruber?
5194123 5198686 I have comrades-in-arms<br />around the world languishing in prison.
5198710 5202024 The American State Department<br />enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.
5202048 5205694 Now it can rattle it for me.
5205718 5210073 The following people<br />are to be released from their captors.
5210097 5213160 In Northern Ireland,<br />the seven members of the New Provo Front.
5213184 5217873 In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders<br />of Liberté de Québec.
5217897 5220516 In Sri Lanka, the nine members
5220540 5223693 - of the Asian Dawn movement.<br />- What the fuck?
5225446 5228842 I read about them in Time magazine.
5228866 5232512 When these revolutionary<br />brothers and sisters are free...
5232536 5235682 the hostages in this building<br />will be taken to the roof...
5235706 5240145 and they will accompany us in helicopters<br />to the Los Angeles International Airport...
5240169 5242272 where they will be given<br />further instructions.
5242296 5244733 You have two hours to comply.
5244757 5248320 Wait a minute.<br />Mr. Gruber, this is crazy.
5248344 5251906 I-I-I don't have the authority. I can't<br />authorize - Two hours is not enough.
5251930 5254159 H-Hello?
5254183 5256411 Hello?
5256435 5259748 Danny, did you get all that?<br />Let's go. We gotta make some calls.
5259772 5261959 Do you think they'll<br />even try to do it?
5261983 5264359 Who cares?
5266654 5268632 Theo, are we on schedule?
5268656 5271718 One more to go, then it's up to you.<br />And you better be right...
5271742 5274179 because it looks like<br />this last one's gonna take a miracle.
5274203 5277266 It's Christmas, Theo.<br />It's the time of miracles.
5277290 5282145 So be of good cheer and call me<br />when you hit the last lock.
5282169 5286816 Karl, hunt that little shit down<br />and get those detonators.
5286840 5288986 Fritz is checking the explosives.
5289010 5291780 I'll check the explosives.<br />You just get the detonators.
5291804 5294199 Hey, Powell, you out there?
5294223 5297411 I'm here, John. I'm here.
5297435 5301187 You gotta believe me.<br />There was nothing I could do.
5302398 5305085 Well, it's gonna be both<br />our asses if you're wrong.
5305109 5307569 I hear you.
5312992 5315285 Did you catch that bullshit<br />Hans was running?
5316412 5319056 It doesn't make sense, man.
5319080 5323020 Don't ask me, man. I'm just a desk jockey<br />who was on my way home when you rang.
5323044 5326648 The way you drove that car,<br />I figured you for the street, Al.
5326672 5329860 In my youth. In my youth.
5329884 5335073 And author of Hostage Terrorist,<br />Terrorist Hostage: A Study in Duality.
5335097 5338535 Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we expect<br />in the next few hours?
5338559 5342164 Well, Gail, by this time the hostages<br />should be going through...
5342188 5344708 the early stages<br />of the "Helsinki Syndrome."
5344732 5348170 - As in Helsinki, Sweden.<br />- Finland.
5348194 5352215 Basically, it's when the hostages<br />and the terrorists go through...
5352239 5356803 a sort of psychological transference<br />and a projection of dependency.
5356827 5360015 A strange sort of trust<br />and bond develops.
5360039 5362351 We've had situations<br />where the hostages...
5362375 5364895 have embraced their captors<br />after their release...
5364919 5367272 and even corresponded<br />with them in prison.
5367296 5369816 No, no.<br />No, darling. "Asian Dawn."
5369840 5373528 Dawn. D-A-W-N.
5373552 5375530 - Sir?<br />- I - Yeah?
5375554 5378450 - The FBI is here.<br />- Oh. The FBI is here now?
5378474 5380452 Yes, sir, right over there.
5380476 5384062 - Hold this.<br />- You want a breath mint?
5386190 5388502 Uh, yeah. We got it.
5388526 5391129 Hey! How you doing, man?
5391153 5393673 I'm Agent Johnson.<br />This is Special Agent Johnson.
5393697 5396968 - Oh. How you doing?<br />- No relation.
5396992 5399846 I'm, uh -
5399870 5403725 I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD<br />I'm in charge here.
5403749 5406000 Not anymore.
5459889 5464267 Hi, there. How you doing?
5467520 5470041 Oh!
5470065 5475172 Please, God, no. You're one of them,<br />aren't you? You're one of them.
5475196 5477799 Don't - Don't kill me.<br />Please, don't. Please!
5477823 5480552 - Don't kill me. Don't kill me, please.<br />- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
5480576 5485163 Relax. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you!
5487750 5489959 Oh, God.
5492755 5495901 What the fuck are you doing up here?<br />What were you looking for?
5495925 5499613 I managed to get out of there,<br />and, uh -
5499637 5501906 Well, I was just trying<br />to get up on the roof...
5501930 5505869 and see if I could<br />signal for help, you know.
5505893 5507954 It's just through here.<br />Why don't you come and help -
5507978 5511666 - Whoa, whoa, whoa. Forget the roof.<br />- Come on. Come on.
5511690 5516171 I said forget the roof.<br />They got people all over it.
5516195 5518696 Come on. You wanna stay alive,<br />you stay with me.
5521367 5523720 Well, the best way<br />we can figure it is...
5523744 5527140 we've got maybe<br />30 or 35 hostages up there...
5527164 5529142 probably on the 30th floor...
5529166 5532771 and maybe, I don't know,<br />seven or eight terrorists up there.
5532795 5535148 Sounds like an A-7 scenario.
5535172 5537234 Thank you.<br />We'll handle it from here.
5537258 5540612 When we commandeer your men,<br />we'll try and let you know.
5540636 5543323 - Aren't you forgetting something?<br />- Such as?
5543347 5545325 What about John McClane?
5545349 5548536 He's the reason why we have<br />the information we have up until now.
5548560 5552249 He's also the reason why you're facing<br />seven terrorists instead of 12.
5552273 5554668 He's inside? Who is he?
5554692 5557629 Well, he might be a cop.<br />I don't know. We're checking on that.
5557653 5560571 - One of yours?<br />- No. No way.
5564326 5567036 Do you smoke?
5567870 5570081 Yeah.
5574628 5576879 Thanks.
5580426 5583719 You don't work for Nakatomi.
5586640 5588808 And if you're not one of them -
5591270 5593437 I'm a cop from New York.
5594773 5596751 New York?
5596775 5598836 Yeah.
5598860 5603239 Got invited to the Christmas<br />party by mistake. Who knew?
5608912 5611766 Yeah.
5611790 5614917 It's better than being caught<br />with your pants down, huh?
5621884 5624635 I'm John McClane.
5626013 5627763 You're, uh -
5628724 5631620 Clay.
5631644 5633811 Bill Clay.
5639735 5642028 You know how to use a handgun, Bill?
5643238 5645216 I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.
5645240 5647636 You know that game<br />with the guns that shoot red paint?
5647660 5651037 Probably seems<br />kind of stupid to you.
5651789 5654040 Well...
5655500 5657668 time for the real thing, Bill.
5666010 5669805 All you gotta do<br />is pull the trigger. Come on.
5678273 5680691 33rd. floor. Come right away.
5688992 5691136 Put down the gun...
5691160 5693537 and give me my detonators.
5697793 5702148 Well, well, well. Hans.
5702172 5705925 Put it down now.
5709596 5713118 That's pretty tricky<br />with that accent.
5713142 5715601 You oughta be on fucking TV<br />with that accent.
5718355 5722085 But what do you want<br />with the detonators, Hans?
5722109 5726464 I already used all the explosives.
5726488 5728698 Or did I?
5730159 5732220 - I'm going to count to three.<br />- Yeah.
5732244 5734889 Like you did with Takagi?
5734913 5737726 Oops.
5737750 5741229 No bullets. You think<br />I'm fucking stupid, Hans?
5741253 5743629 You were saying?
5796517 5799536 Karl.
5799560 5803647 Shoot the Windows!
5807486 5810488 Shoot the glass.
5843814 5846023 Jesus Christ!
5874510 5877555 Smile, Karl.<br />We're back in business.
5880017 5883496 Is the last resort of diplomacy.
5883520 5886332 Then couldn't we just as well say...
5886356 5889168 that terrorism has an equal claim<br />on being that too?
5889192 5892046 You got something.<br />Tell me you got something.
5892070 5894924 Just McClane's name, badge number,<br />employment record...
5894948 5897594 vital statistics<br />and his family's home address...
5897618 5900138 right here in L.A.
5900162 5902955 Whoa!
5907836 5909689 Go to work.
5909713 5911964 Got it.
5923769 5927855 God, that man looks really pissed.
5929149 5933880 - He's still alive.<br />- What?
5933904 5938157 Only John can drive<br />somebody that crazy.
5952798 5955526 Hans.
5955550 5958154 You better heat up that miracle, because<br />we just broke through on number six...
5958178 5960949 and the electromagnetic<br />came down like a fucking anvil.
5960973 5966518 Have a look at what our friends outside<br />are doing, and I'll be right up.
5968730 5972210 Hey, John?<br />John McClane, you still with us?
5972234 5974212 Yeah.
5974236 5978072 But all things being equal,<br />I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
5978907 5981594 Chalk up two more bad guys.
5981618 5984370 Well, the boys down here<br />will be glad to hear that.
5985247 5987475 You know, we got<br />a pool going on you.
5987499 5990812 - What kind of odds am I gettin'?<br />- You don't want to know.
5990836 5994713 Put me down for 20.<br />I'm good for it.
5997259 6000719 Hey, Powell, you got flat feet?
6002597 6004659 What the hell<br />you talking about, man?
6004683 6007662 Something had to<br />get you off the street.
6007686 6010248 What's the matter? You don't think<br />jockeying papers across a desk...
6010272 6013023 is a noble effort for a cop?
6014234 6016485 No.
6018739 6022676 - I had an accident.<br />- The way you drive, I can see why.
6022700 6026537 What'd you do, run over<br />your captain's foot with a car?
6029416 6031583 I shot a kid.
6033128 6036606 He was 13 years old.
6036630 6039110 It was dark. I couldn't see him.<br />He had a ray gun.
6039134 6041385 It looked real enough.
6043472 6046576 You know, when you're a rookie, they can<br />teach you everything about being a cop...
6046600 6049268 except how to live with a mistake.
6053148 6057484 Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself<br />to draw my gun on anybody again.
6060989 6063801 Sorry, man.
6063825 6066702 Hey, man, how could you know?
6068830 6071915 I feel like shit anyway.
6073293 6075271 Well, then this won't matter.
6075295 6080257 The LAPD is not calling<br />the shots down here anymore.
6082510 6085554 - Feds?<br />- You got it.
6086848 6090059 All right, those<br />are the city engineers.
6091937 6093915 They're going into<br />the street circuits.
6093939 6096766 Those guys in the suits -<br />I don't know who they are.
6096790 6098233 That's the FBI
6099360 6102506 They're ordering the others<br />to cut the building's power.
6102530 6104782 Regular as clockwork.
6106243 6110306 - Or a time lock.<br />- Precisely.
6110330 6114352 The circuits that cannot be cut<br />are cut automatically...
6114376 6117230 in response to a terrorist incident.
6117254 6120024 You asked for miracles, Theo.<br />I give you...
6120048 6123528 the FBI
6123552 6125295 I said I want the friggin'<br />building shut down.
6125319 6127115 - I got a problem.<br />- I don't care what your problem--
6127139 6130034 - I got a switch here -<br />- I don't give two shits about your switch!
6130058 6133162 - I want the building out. Dark. D-A-R-K!<br />- Hold on! You don't understand.
6133186 6135164 - You can't do it from here.<br />- Yeah, you could.
6135188 6136874 It can't be done from here.
6136898 6137932 I could just - I got the radio.
6137956 6140002 You can't do it from<br />down here I'm telling you.
6140026 6142296 It's gotta be done from downtown.
6142320 6144298 They've gotta take out<br />a whole city grid.
6144322 6146843 - We're talking 10 square blocks.<br />- Ten blocks?
6146867 6148845 Johnson, that's crazy.<br />It's Christmas Eve, man.
6148869 6152473 - There's thousands of people.<br />- You have to go wider.
6152497 6154475 - I need authorization.<br />- Authorization?
6154499 6156284 How about the United<br />States fucking government?
6156308 6157353 Hey.
6157377 6160003 Lose the grid or you lose your job.
6166094 6168072 - Yeah, Central?<br />- Yeah?
6168096 6171616 This is Walt down at Nakatomi.<br />Say, listen.
6171640 6175580 Would it be possible<br />for you to turn off grid 212?
6175604 6179166 - Are you crazy?<br />- Maybe I should call the mayor.
6179190 6182253 No shit, it's my ass. I got a big problem<br />down here. Shut it down.
6182277 6184987 Shut it down now.
6187407 6191012 Emergency lighting activated.
6191036 6193530 Powell. Powell, talk to<br />me. What's going on here?
6193554 6195391 Ask the FBI.
6195415 6198226 They got the universal<br />terrorist playbook...
6198250 6200878 and they're running it step by step.
6202797 6204775 It's gonna go. It's gonna go!
6204799 6208177 Yes!
6230700 6232951 Merry Christmas.
6234829 6236933 Those bastards are probably<br />pissing in their pants right now.
6236957 6239124 The mayor's gonna have my ass.
6246132 6248383 Whoo!
6260230 6263542 Well, what are we gonna do now?
6263566 6266045 Arrest them for not<br />paying their electric bill?
6266069 6271008 We've shut them down. We let 'em sweat<br />for a while, then we give 'em helicopters.
6271032 6273283 Right up the ass.
6276079 6279350 This is Agent Johnson.<br />No, the other one.
6279374 6282520 I want that air support<br />ready to lift off in five minutes.
6282544 6286004 Damn right. Fully armed.<br />We're on the way.
6290050 6293804 Oh, yeah!
6295557 6297975 I wish to talk to the FBI
6300520 6302498 This is Special Agent Johnson<br />of the FBI
6302522 6307044 The State Department has arranged<br />for the return of your comrades.
6307068 6309839 Helicopters are en route<br />as you requested.
6309863 6311841 I hear you. We'll be ready.
6311865 6314593 By the time he figures out<br />what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.
6314617 6316679 When they touch down,<br />we'll blow the roof.
6316703 6318723 They'll spend a month<br />sifting through the rubble.
6318747 6321225 And by the time they figure out<br />what went wrong...
6321249 6324835 we'll be sitting on a beach<br />earning 20%.
6329466 6332736 Powell.
6332760 6335012 Yo, Powell, you got a minute?
6336264 6338473 I'm here, John.
6340143 6343622 Listen, man, I'm starting<br />to get a bad feeling up here.
6343646 6345875 I want you to do something for me.
6345899 6348544 Um -
6348568 6352756 I want you to find my wife.<br />Don't ask me how. By then, you'll know how.
6352780 6357303 Uh, I want you<br />to tell her something.
6357327 6359846 I want you to tell her that...
6359870 6362122 um -
6366127 6369273 Tell her it took me<br />a while to figure out...
6369297 6373258 what a jerk I've been, but, um -
6374302 6376553 but that -
6379474 6382078 that when things<br />started to pan out for her...
6382102 6387606 I should've been<br />more supportive, and, uh -
6388942 6391652 and I just should've been<br />behind her more.
6393488 6396573 Oh, shit.
6398827 6402098 Tell her that, um -
6402122 6406291 that she's the best thing that<br />ever happened to a bum like me.
6408169 6411922 She's heard me say "I love you"<br />a thousand times.
6413174 6415592 She never heard me say, "I'm sorry."
6416928 6420825 And I want you to tell her that.<br />I want you to tell her that...
6420849 6424328 John said that he was sorry.
6424352 6426539 Okay?
6426563 6430107 - You got that, man?<br />- Yeah, I got it, John.
6431192 6434171 But you can tell her that yourself.
6434195 6438342 You just watch your ass and you'll<br />make it out of there. You hear me?
6438366 6440826 Well, I guess that's up<br />to the man upstairs.
6444372 6448310 John? John?
6448334 6451253 What the fuck were<br />you doing upstairs, Hans?
6453548 6454282 John?
6454306 6457926 No, Al, listen. Listen,<br />just lay off for a while.
6459720 6461972 I gotta go check on something.
6465059 6467788 One minute.<br />That's all I'm asking.
6467812 6470541 One minute just to speak to you.<br />All right. All right.
6470565 6474086 All right. Get back.<br />Get back. Off. Off. All right.
6474110 6477381 Look, you let me in right now,<br />or I call the I.N.S.
6477405 6480092 Comprende?
6480116 6485454 Look, this is the last time these kids<br />are gonna have to speak to their parents.
6487332 6491168 All right? All right.<br />Come on. Come on.
6501638 6505432 What were you doing, Hans?<br />What were you doing?
6527455 6530499 Jesus, Mary, mother of God.
6533878 6536106 Powell, listen to me!<br />It's a double cross!
6536130 6538715 The whole roof<br />of the building's wired to -
6541177 6543428 John.
6544222 6546200 John.
6546224 6549119 John, come in. Did you get that?
6549143 6551895 No. Something about a double cross.
6552647 6554856 Tell me about it.
6560446 6562781 We are both professionals.
6564867 6567805 This is personal.
6567829 6570455 Oh.
6590018 6593080 They're coming.
6593104 6595082 - Choppers are coming.<br />- Okay.
6595106 6599086 Time to gather your flock,<br />Miss Gennero.
6599110 6601505 You know, your mom<br />and dad are very important people.
6601529 6604842 They're very brave people.
6604866 6608410 So is there something you would like<br />to say to them if they're watching?
6609245 6611997 Come home.
6618713 6621798 Mrs. McClane.
6625053 6629014 How nice to make your acquaintance.
6631726 6633704 On your feet, everyone!<br />To the roof!
6633728 6636771 Lock them up there<br />and come right back.
6638440 6640692 Move! Come on! Let's move!
6665093 6669596 You should've heard your brother squeal<br />when I broke his fucking neck!
6672642 6675286 What do you figure the breakage?
6675310 6677373 Figure we take out the terrorists...
6677397 6681085 lose 20-25% of the hostages... tops.
6681109 6683629 I can live with that.
6683653 6688740 Keep this thing on the deck.<br />They're expecting transports, not gunships.
6700420 6704108 Move it! Come on! Move!<br />Come on! Come on!
6704132 6706694 Move it!
6706718 6709761 Let's go! Move!
6712056 6714993 Theo. A little bonus for us.
6715017 6717830 - Please, sit down. Sit down.<br />- Hey!
6717854 6719956 A policeman's wife<br />might come in handy.
6719980 6723626 McClane, I have some news for you.
6723650 6726027 McClane.
6736080 6738331 Come on! Move, move!
6740209 6742419 Come on!
6753806 6756182 Motherfucker, I'll kill you!
6759187 6762416 Armed. The truck?
6762440 6764691 The truck.
6770948 6774678 After all your posturing,<br />all your little speeches...
6774702 6777346 you're nothing but a common thief.
6777370 6780142 I am an exceptional thief,<br />Mrs. McClane.
6780166 6783626 And since I'm moving up to kidnapping,<br />you should be more polite.
6790676 6792863 Motherfucker, I'm gonna kill you!
6792887 6796598 I'm gonna fucking cook you,<br />and I'm gonna fucking eat you!
6818955 6821289 I don't like this, Sarge.
6831759 6835345 Just like fuckin' Saigon, eh, slick?
6836597 6839349 I was in junior high, dickhead.
6867587 6870440 Where's Holly?<br />Where's Holly Gennero?
6870464 6874194 Holly Gennero! Where's Holly?<br />Where's Holly? Where is she?
6874218 6875863 - They took her!<br />- Where?
6875887 6877739 - The vault!<br />- Where is the vault?
6877763 6882369 The 30th floor. Up the stairs.<br />They just took her!
6882393 6886623 Get downstairs, all of you! The whole<br />fuckin' roof is wired to blow. Get down!
6886647 6891461 Get down! Get the fuck downstairs!
6891485 6892645 They made us, Bureau.
6892669 6895196 - You got a terrorist shooting hostages.<br />- I see it. Bank left.
6902370 6905415 Nail that sucker!
6912173 6915276 I'm on your side, you assholes!
6915300 6918636 Shit. Swing around again!<br />I'll bag this little bastard.
6938032 6940783 What the fuck - Jesus!
6942119 6944514 Oh, John, what the fuck<br />are you doing?
6944538 6947498 How the fuck<br />did you get into this shit?
6956968 6960446 There's something wrong.<br />They're coming back down.
6960470 6962866 - Blow the roof.<br />- But Karl's up there!
6962890 6965475 Blow the roof!
6967395 6970540 I promise I will never even think...
6970564 6973608 about going up<br />in a tall building again.
6976570 6979322 Oh, God.<br />Please don't let me die.
6991585 6994337 Holy shit!
7070706 7073499 Holy Christ!
7074418 7077170 We're gonna need some more<br />FBI guys, I guess.
7089725 7092060 Jesus fucking Christ!
7118045 7120797 What the fuck is going on?
7122716 7126386 What are you gonna do, sit here while<br />the building falls down around your ears?
7133477 7135288 Shit!
7135312 7138022 Hey! All right!
7141152 7146614 Hang on, baby.<br />Hang on, honey. Oh, God.
7191493 7193411 Hans!
7207176 7209529 Jesus.
7209553 7211929 Hi, honey.
7234078 7236056 So that's what this was all about?
7236080 7239749 - A fucking robbery?<br />- Put down the gun.
7241585 7243563 Why did you have to nuke<br />the whole building, Hans?
7243587 7246691 When you steal $600,<br />you can just disappear.
7246715 7249819 When you steal 600 million,<br />they will find you...
7249843 7252322 unless they think<br />you're already dead.
7252346 7254555 Put down the gun.
7264775 7268380 Nein (No)! This is mine.
7268404 7271758 You got me.
7271782 7274469 Still the cowboy, Mr. McClane.
7274493 7276805 Americans, all alike.<br />Well, this time...
7276829 7280266 John Wayne does not<br />walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
7280290 7282185 That's Gary Cooper, asshole.
7282209 7284062 Enough jokes.
7284086 7287023 You'd have made a pretty good<br />cowboy yourself, Hans.
7287047 7291778 Oh, yes.<br />What was it you said to me before?
7291802 7297265 Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.
7316327 7318452 Holly!
7323375 7326419 Happy trails, Hans.
7369170 7371547 I hope that's not a hostage.
7399952 7404246 Give me water hook-ups for engine<br />companies five, three, nine, six.
7407626 7410271 Over here. It's a better angle.
7410295 7413005 Let's give 'em a hand over there.
7414383 7416842 Keep it going now.<br />Keep it going.
7422140 7424119 Come on. Come on!<br />We're gonna miss it.
7424143 7426246 - Okay, hand me my notes.<br />- Come on!
7426270 7429021 Keep that water on there.
7448500 7451938 What was it like in there? How did they<br />treat you? Did they frighten you at all?
7451962 7454274 - Any comment?<br />- We don't wanna talk about it.
7454298 7457800 How does it feel to be outside?
7499050 7501070 Al, this is my wife Holly.
7501094 7503364 Holly Gennero.
7503388 7506868 - Holly McClane.<br />- Hello, Holly.
7506892 7511122 You got yourself a good man.<br />You take good care of him.
7511146 7513208 - McClane?<br />- Yeah, it's okay. Let him through.
7513232 7515335 McClane, I wanna debrief.
7515359 7519172 I want a debriefing.<br />You got some things to answer for, mister.
7519196 7522258 Ellis's murder, for one thing.<br />Property damage.
7522282 7524617 Interfering with police business.
7564783 7568054 All right, I want two of you to go<br />inside and see if there's anybody else.
7568078 7570371 Yes, sir. I'll take the left.
7577713 7581423 - Watch it!<br />- Whoa. This one's with me.
7588180 7591536 Five, four, three, two.
7591560 7594205 Mr. McClane. Mr. McClane,<br />now that it's all over...
7594229 7597731 after this incredible ordeal,<br />what are your feelings?
7602779 7605133 Well, well, well.
7605157 7608117 - Merry Christmas, Argyle.<br />- Merry Christmas.
7610996 7612974 Did you get that?
7612998 7616102 Let me through.<br />Let me through. Thank you.
7616126 7620129 If this is their idea of Christmas,<br />I gotta be here for New Year's.
