2945242 2948578 Perfect. The elevators are locked off. He can't escape.
2948612 2950380 Just shut him in and come back down.

3270367 3272569 Ask me, that god damn computer sent you out
3272602 3274671 on another wild goose chase.
3274704 3276106 They've been chasing bugs in this system

3521251 3524187 This is a matter of inconvenient timing. That's all.
3524220 3526055 Police action was inevitable,
3526089 3529259 and, as it happens, necessary.
3529292 3532896 So let them fumble about outside, and stay calm.

3542338 3545041 Maybe you should have put it on the bulletin board.
3545074 3548111 I figured since I waxed Tony and Marco and his friend here,
3548144 3551080 I figured you and Karl and Franco might be a little lonely.
3551114 3553249 So I wanted to give you a call.

3557086 3559622 That's very kind of you.
3559656 3562325 I assume you are our mysterious party crasher.
3563126 3566896 You are most troublesome for a security guard.
3566930 3569899 (makes buzzer sound) Sorry, Hans. Wrong guess.
3569933 3571401 Would you like to go for double jeopardy
3571434 3573603 where the scores can really change?
3577774 3580143 Hmm. These are very bad for you.
3581311 3582412 Who are you then?
3582445 3585114 Just a fly in the ointment, Hans.
3585148 3586950 A monkey in the wrench.
3586983 3588351 A pain in the ass.
3591154 3593656 -Whoa. -(static)
3593690 3596025 Check on all the others. Don't use the radio.
3596059 3597427 See if he's lying about Marco
3597460 3599228 and find out if anyone else is missing.
3603900 3605635 Mr. Mystery Guest...
3607203 3608304 are you still there?
3609806 3611207 Yeah, I'm still here.
3611240 3613076 Unless you wanna open the front door for me.
3614210 3616112 HANS: No, I'm afraid not.
3616145 3619115 But you have me at a loss.
3619148 3620350 You know my name, but who are you?
3621184 3625888 Just another American who saw too many movies as a child?
3625922 3628191 Another orphan of a bankrupt culture
3628224 3629959 who thinks he's John Wayne?
3629993 3632762 Rambo? Marshal Dillon?
3632795 3636132 I was always kind of partial to Roy Rogers actually.
3636165 3638134 I really liked those sequined shirts.

3705268 3708938 He wasn't lying about Marco. He's down on the street.
3708971 3711107 And the other man was Heinrich.
3711140 3712775 And his bag is missing.
3715244 3716979 But he had the detonators.

3731861 3733863 Then don't waste time talking to me.
3735031 3738434 This is Sergeant Al Powell of the Los Angeles Police Department.
3738468 3741504 If the person who radioed for help can hear me on this channel,
3741537 3743439 acknowledge this transmission.
3743473 3746476 I say again, if the person who radioed for help
3746509 3749479 on this channel can hear me, acknowledge this transmission.
3749512 3750480 (sirens wailing)
3754951 3757520 I read you, Powell. You the guy in the car?
3757553 3759489 What's left of him.
3759522 3761357 Can you identify yourself?
3761390 3763559 Not now. Maybe later.
3763593 3765094 Listen fast. This is a party line,
3765128 3767230 and the neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.
3767263 3768598 All right, here's the deal.
3768631 3770967 You got 30 or so hostages on the 30th floor.
3771000 3772435 The leader, his name is Hans.
3772468 3774036 We have to find him and shut him up.
3774070 3775204 He's telling them everything!
3775238 3777073 Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI to arrive.
3777106 3779108 Until then, he can waste as much time as he likes,
3779142 3781978 but we must find the bag.
3782011 3783846 -Fritz, go help Uli. -McCLANE: A freakin' arsenal.
3783880 3785381 We must have the detonators.
3785414 3787917 McCLANE: They got missiles, automatic weapons,
3787950 3788985 and enough plastic explosives
3789018 3790186 to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.
3790219 3793956 They're down to nine now, countin' the skydiver you met.
3793990 3795291 These guys are mostly European,
3795324 3797126 judging by their clothing labels and...
3799061 3800163 (sirens wailing in distance)
3805034 3806536 cigarettes.
3806569 3809005 They're well-financed and very slick.
3809038 3810873 Well, now how do you know that?
3810907 3812475 McCLANE: I've seen enough phony IDs in my time,
3812508 3814043 to recognize that the ones they got
3814076 3815878 must've cost a fortune.
3815912 3817046 (sighs)
3818648 3820082 Add all that up,
3820116 3821284 I don't know what the fuck it means,
3821317 3823252 but you got some badass perpetrators,
3823286 3824954 and they're here to stay.
3826489 3829392 I hear you, partner. LA's finest are on it.
3829425 3831394 So light 'em if you got 'em.
3831427 3832995 Way ahead of you, partner.
3834931 3836132 So what do I call you?
3838401 3839535 Call me...
3841404 3842338 Roy.
3842371 3844307 Well, listen up, Roy.
3844340 3846209 If you think of anything else you think we need to know,
3846242 3847677 don't be shy, okay?
3847710 3849345 In the meantime, I want you to find a safe place
3849378 3850413 to hole up and let us do our job.
3850446 3851447 Understand?
3851480 3852648 McCLANE: They're all yours, Al.
3871300 3872535 All right, who's talking to 'em?
3873736 3876138 I am, sir. Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.
3877473 3879108 Dwayne Robinson, Powell. What's the deal here?
3879141 3881077 What do these pricks want?
3881110 3884013 Well, if you mean the terrorists, sir, we don't exactly know.
3884046 3885948 We haven't heard a peep from them.
3885982 3887383 Well, who in the hell have you been talking to?
3888584 3890086 We don't know that either, sir.
3890119 3891120 He won't give us his name.
3891921 3894123 But he appears to be the one who phoned in the report.
3894156 3895658 He's killed one terrorist for sure,
3895691 3897293 and he claims he's capped off two others.
3897326 3898427 He claims?
3899595 3901530 Powell, has it occurred to you he could be
3901564 3904100 one of the terrorists pulling your chain?
3904133 3905701 Or some nutcase in there?
3905735 3909105 I don't think so, sir. In fact, I think he's a cop.
3909138 3911641 Maybe not LAPD, but he's definitely a badge.
3911674 3914076 -How do you know that? -A hunch.
3914110 3915511 Things he said,
3915544 3917480 like being able to spot a phony ID.
3917513 3920149 Jesus Christ, Powell!
3920182 3922985 He could be a fucking bartender for all we know.
3923019 3923686 TV's here.

4022418 4023552 for a special news bulletin.
4023586 4026589 This is Richard Thornburg, live from Century City.
4027690 4029792 Tonight, Los Angeles has joined
4029825 4032828 the sad and worldwide fraternity of cities
4032862 4034530 whose only membership requirement
4034563 4038267 is to suffer the anguish of international terrorism.
4038300 4042538 Approximately two hours ago, an unidentified group of men
4042571 4045241 seized control of the Nakatomi building,
4045274 4047643 sealing off all entrances and exits.
4047676 4049678 All telephone lines have been cut.
4049712 4052248 And the only communication now possible
4052281 4055284 has been through the use of CB communicators,
4055317 4057620 which the group apparently brought with them.
4057653 4059755 According to official sources,
4059789 4062291 the perpetrators of this strange building--
4062324 4064894 MAN (on radio): Unit Five, hold your position at the main entrance.

4079675 4081744 What's it look like? We're going in.
4081777 4084513 Goin' in? Man, that's crazy!
4084547 4087149 There could be over 30 hostages in there for all we know.
4087183 4088651 We don't know shit, Powell.
4088684 4090619 If there's hostages, how come nobody's come to us
4090653 4092421 with ransom demands, huh?
4092455 4095925 If there's terrorists in there, where's their list of demands?
4095958 4098227 All we know is that somebody shot your car up.
4098260 4100296 It's probably the same silly son of a bitch
4100329 4102331 you've been talking to on that radio.
4102364 4104567 Excuse me, sir,
4104600 4106635 but what about the body that fell out the window?
4106669 4109605 Well, who knows? Probably some stockbroker who got depressed.
4109638 4112174 -We're ready for you, Chief. -All right, light 'em up. Let's go.
4112208 4114410 -All right, hit your lights. -Blue Unit, go.
4114443 4115811 -We got approval, Chief. -MAN: Lights on!
4119215 4120216 MAN: Down a little.
4127890 4128791 Al.
4130493 4132394 Al, you still with me, babe? What's going on?
4133662 4134864 Yo, Al?
4134897 4136599 I'm here, Roy.
4136632 4138801 I'm kind of busy right now. I'll talk to you later.
4138834 4139835 Al, what's wrong? What's going on?
4139869 4142438 POWELL: I said I'll talk to you later, Roy.
4142471 4144740 If you are what I think you are, then you'll know when to listen,
4144773 4146375 when to shut up and--
4147877 4149812 and when to pray.
4149845 4152181 Jesus Christ. You're coming in. That's it, isn't it?
4153215 4155718 Christ, Powell, I told you what kind of people you're dealing with here.
4155751 4158187 -ROBINSON: All right, let's load 'em up. -MAN: Blue, go.
4160923 4163893 So, they'll be coming. Everyone get ready.
4164894 4167229 Theo, you are the eyes now.
4179842 4181577 -Rivers! -Yo!
4181610 4183379 Begin your reconnoiter.
4184680 4185681 Let's go!
4189451 4190619 Shit!
4199995 4202765 (tires squealing)
4210072 4211874 Hey, come on. Let's go!
4222384 4223752 Ow! Jesus.
4257886 4259455 All right, spread out.
4264393 4266662 (humming)
4281744 4284546 (exhales sharply)
4286148 4287449 Shut up.
4289618 4290619 Let's go!
4295991 4297960 You macho assholes. No! No!
4300929 4303832 THEO (clears throat): All right. Listen up, guys.
4306402 4309805 'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house
4309838 4312741 not a creature was stirring, except...
4312775 4314510 the four assholes coming in the rear
4314543 4316912 in standard two-by-two cover formation.
4319682 4320616 Okay, we're all set.
4322051 4323052 We're ready.
4324520 4326622 -Kick ass. -Go!
4326655 4328357 Right. Let's do it.
4344173 4345774 Take cover!
4345808 4347743 They're shootin' at 'em!
4347776 4349845 It's panic fire. They can't see anything.
4349878 4351714 They're shootin' at the lights.
4356552 4359588 They're going after the lights. Pull 'em back.
4361090 4363392 -It's not happening. -Mike, burn it.
4365594 4367162 Don't be impatient.
4368163 4369832 Just wound them.
4371300 4374203 -Get 'em back. They're sittin' ducks up there without lights. -No, they're almost in.
4374236 4376438 -Get 'em back! -They're almost in.
4376472 4377639 Send in the car.
4377673 4379108 Send in the car.
4392588 4393956 Jesus Christ!
4395691 4396825 (screaming)
4396859 4399895 -(men screaming on radio) -Rivers, Rodriguez, report.
4399928 4401530 Whoa! Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
4401563 4402798 What have we here, gentlemen?
4406902 4409638 The police have themselves an RV.
4414877 4416078 Southeast corner.
4418247 4420482 (shouting in German)
4429525 4431126 Oh, Jesus Christ.
4432761 4436231 (whirring)
4443005 4445774 Out of here! Get back! Get the fuck back!
4447676 4450145 -Get over there! -(speaking German)
4463292 4465494 (continues in German)
4484913 4485848 I see him!
4492120 4493689 (in German)
4505167 4508103 Oh, my God! The quarterback is toast.
4508136 4510205 -All right! All right! -Get them out of the car. Let's go!
4510239 4511240 Hang on, Rivers. That's an order.
4512708 4513609 Hit it again.
4513642 4515878 Hans, you motherfucker, you made your point!
4515911 4516912 Let 'em pull back!
4516945 4518280 Thank you, Mr. Cowboy.
4518313 4520849 I'll take it under advisement. Hit it again.
4535397 4536665 Fire.
4551179 4553115 Fuck me.
4553148 4554816 Let's go! Get 'em out of the car.
4554850 4555784 Don't you know they're burning?
4557219 4559288 (all groaning)
4565894 4567796 Fuck it.
4567829 4569631 (in German)
4579041 4581710 Let's see you take this under advisement, jerk-weed.
4586415 4588250 Geronimo, motherfucker!
4607069 4608136 Oh, shit!
4613809 4615010 They're using artillery on us!
4615043 4617045 You idiot. It's not the police.
4618280 4619348 It's him.
4627022 4628190 Holy shit.
4633462 4634863 My God.
4637232 4638467 Tell me you got that.
4638500 4639835 I got it. I got it.
4639868 4641737 (siren wailing)
4641770 4643205 Eat your heart out, Channel Five.
4645007 4646942 WALLENS: We've had an update on the terrorist takeover
4646975 4648076 of the Nakatomi building.
4648110 4650445 Sources say the terrorist leader Hans
4650479 4652414 may be this man, Hans Gruber,
4652447 4655984 a member of the radical West German Volksfrei movement.
4656018 4657919 Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership
4657953 4659755 issued a communique an hour ago,
4659788 4661256 stating that Gruber had been expelled
4661289 4662257 from that organization.
4662290 4665193 McCLANE: Al, Al, do you copy?
4665227 4666161 Are you all right?
4667162 4670165 Yeah, I'm fine. (coughing)
4670198 4671767 What-What was that?
4671800 4673435 Remember that plastic explosive I told you about?
4673468 4675971 -Yeah. -There you go.
4676004 4677039 Is the building on fire?
4677072 4679007 No, but it's gonna need a paint job
4679041 4681143 and a shitload of screen doors.
4681176 4683245 Our spotters say you got two with that blast.
4683278 4685480 Is that him? Is that him?
4685514 4687282 -Yes, sir. -Give me that.
4687315 4688517 You listen to me, mister.
4688550 4690185 I don't know who in the hell you think you are,
4690218 4693789 or what you're doing, but you just destroyed a building!
4693822 4695524 Now, we do not want your help.
4695557 4698093 Is that clear? We don't want your help.
4698126 4701263 I've got 100 people down here, and they're covered with glass.
4701296 4702864 Glass?
4702898 4705167 Who gives a shit about glass? Who the fuck is this?
4706868 4709337 This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T. Robinson,
4709371 4711473 and I am in charge of this situation.
4711506 4713909 Oh, you're in charge?
4713942 4715377 Well, I got some bad news for you, Dwayne.
4715410 4718880 From up here it doesn't look like you're in charge of jack shit.
4718914 4722017 -You listen to me, you little asshole. I'm-- -McCLANE: Asshole?
4722050 4725954 I'm not the one who just got butt-fucked on national TV, Dwayne.
4725987 4727289 (laughing)
4727322 4728757 McCLANE: Now, you listen to me, jerk-off.
4728790 4730325 If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem.
4730358 4733295 Quit being part of the fucking problem and put the other guy back on!
4738266 4739935 Hey, Roy. How you feelin'?
4739968 4742337 Pretty fuckin' unappreciated, Al.
4742370 4744940 POWELL: Hey, look. I love you.
4744973 4746508 So do a lot of the other guys.
4746541 4748977 So you hang in there, man. You hear me?
4750145 4751279 You hang in there.
4753181 4754783 Yeah, thanks, partner.
4758854 4760288 (snorting loudly)
4760322 4762991 -(clears throat) -What are you doing?
4763024 4764292 I'm tired of sitting here
4764326 4766394 waiting to see who gets us killed first--
4766428 4768230 them or your husband.
4768263 4769931 HOLLY: What are you going to do?
4769965 4772501 Hey, babe, I negotiate million-dollar deals for breakfast.
4772534 4774269 I think I can handle this Eurotrash.
4775070 4778273 Hey. Sprechen sie talk, huh?
4778306 4781176 HANS: If you listened to me, he would be neutralized already.
4781209 4783111 I don't want neutral. I want dead.
4783145 4785113 (knocking on door)
4785147 4786348 Hope I'm not interrupting.
4786381 4787449 What does he want?
4787482 4789151 (chuckles) It's not what I want.
4789184 4790519 It's what I can give you.
4799060 4800996 Look, let's be straight, okay?
4802264 4804065 It's obvious you're not some dumb schmuck up here
4804099 4805634 to snatch a few purses. Am I right?
4805667 4807335 You're very perceptive.
4807369 4809304 I watch 60 Minutes.
4809337 4812007 I say to myself, "These guys are professional,
4812040 4814009 they're motivated, they're happening,
4814042 4816111 i.e., they want something. Huh?"
4816144 4819114 Now, personally, I couldn't care less about your politics.
4819147 4821116 Maybe you're pissed off at the camel jockeys.
4821149 4822617 Maybe it's the Hebes, Northern Ireland.
4822651 4824252 It's none of my business.
4824286 4826888 I figure you're here to negotiate. Am I right?
4826922 4829624 You're amazing. You figured this all out already?
4829658 4833028 (laughs) Hey, business is business.
4833061 4834896 You use a gun. I use a fountain pen.
4834930 4837299 What's the difference? Let's put it in my terms.
4837332 4838533 You're here in a hostile takeover,
4838567 4840001 you grab us for some greenmail,
4840035 4841670 but you didn't expect some poison pill
4841703 4843238 was gonna be running around in the building.
4843271 4844906 Am I right?
4844940 4847142 Hans, bubbe,
4848143 4849878 I'm your white knight.
4851546 4854616 I must have missed 60 Minutes. What are you saying?
4857252 4859521 The guy upstairs who's fucking things up? Huh?
4863391 4864626 (clears throat)
4864659 4866127 I can give him to you.
4870232 4871333 McCLANE (on radio): Oh, God!
4873568 4875971 Roy! Roy, you all right?
4877339 4879641 Just trying to fire down a thousand-year-old Twinkie.
4879674 4881610 (spits)
4881643 4883278 What do they put in these things, anyway?
4884346 4886047 Sugar-enriched flour,
4886081 4888316 partially hydrogenated vegetable oil,
4888350 4889484 polysorbate 60,
4889517 4891953 and yellow dye number five.
4891987 4894055 Just everything a growing boy needs.
4895090 4896958 How many kids you got, Al?
4896992 4898526 POWELL: Well, as a matter of fact, my wife is working
4898560 4899628 on our first.
4901429 4903365 How about you, cowboy?
4903398 4905300 You got any kids back on your ranch?
4907002 4908603 Yeah. Two.
4910372 4911606 I sure hope I can see 'em swinging
4911640 4914042 on a jungle gym with Al Jr. someday.
4914075 4916478 (Powell chuckling)
4916511 4918480 Well, now, that's a date.
4918513 4921049 But, uh, you're gonna have to bring the ice cream.
4921082 4922584 HANS (on radio): Touching, cowboy. Touching.
4924152 4925320 Or should I call you...
4925353 4927289 Mr. McClane?
4928790 4931526 Mr. Officer John McClane
4931559 4933695 of the New York Police Department.
4935797 4937098 Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
4937132 4938199 -Come on, baby, move. -Got it.
4938233 4940302 Better get ahold of somebody at Dispatch.
4941202 4944272 Sister Theresa called me Mr. McClane in the third grade.
4945373 4946608 My friends call me John.
4947709 4949477 You're neither, shithead.
4951346 4953148 I have someone who wants to talk to you--
4954749 4956217 a very special friend
4956251 4958219 who was with you at the party tonight.
4964759 4966461 Hey, John Boy.
4968363 4970031 Ellis?
4970065 4971366 ELLIS: Yeah.
4971399 4972500 Now, listen, John.
4972534 4973735 They're givin' me a few minutes to try
4973768 4975337 to talk some sense into you.
4975370 4977305 I know you think you're doing your job, John,
4977339 4978440 and I can appreciate that,
4978473 4980475 but you're just dragging this thing out.
4980508 4981609 Now, look,
4981643 4983378 no one gets out of here until these guys
4983411 4986314 can talk to the LA police, and that just ain't gonna happen
4986348 4988550 until you stop messing up the works, capisce?
4994222 4996024 Ellis, what have you told them?
4997425 4999094 I told them we were old friends,
4999127 5001096 and you were my guest at the party.
5002697 5004599 Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.
5004632 5006568 Tell me about it. (chuckles)
5012674 5013775 All right, John, listen.
5014976 5018079 They want you to tell them where the detonators are.
5018113 5019414 They know people are listening.
5020615 5022150 They want the detonators,
5022183 5023351 or they're gonna kill me.
5027489 5028757 John, didn't you hear me?
5031593 5033328 Yeah, I hear you.
5033361 5035797 John, I think you could get with the program a little, huh?
5035830 5037632 The police are here now. It's their problem.
5037665 5039267 Now tell these guys where the detonators are
5039300 5040468 so no one else gets hurt.
5040502 5042537 You know, I'm putting my life on the line for you, pal.
5043571 5046408 -Ellis, listen to me very carefully. -John--
5046441 5049177 Shut up, Ellis! Just shut your mouth!
5049210 5051246 Put Hans back on the line.
5051279 5053448 Hans, this shithead does not know
5053481 5055617 what kind of man you are, but I do. Listen--
5055650 5057185 HANS: Good. Then you'll give us what we want
5057218 5058653 and save your friend's life.
5058686 5059888 You're not part of this equation.
5059921 5061356 It's time you realized that.
5061389 5063525 ELLIS: Hey, what am I, a method actor, Hans?
5063558 5065326 (chuckles) Babe, put away the gun.
5065360 5067295 This is radio, not television.
5067328 5069197 Hans, this asshole is not my friend.
5069230 5070698 I just met him tonight. I don't know him.
5070732 5072834 Jesus Christ, Ellis, these people are gonna kill you!
5072867 5074569 Tell them you don't know me!
5074602 5075804 (Ellis chuckles)
5075837 5078106 John, how can you say that after all these years, huh?
5078940 5080141 John?
5081576 5082544 John?
5090618 5091586 (gunshot)
5091619 5094355 (screaming, shouting)
5101696 5104299 (screaming, shouting continue on radio)
5105567 5106501 Do you hear that?
5107302 5109237 Talk to me! Where are my detonators?
5110271 5112874 Where are they, or shall I shoot another one?
5112907 5114809 Sooner or later, I might get to someone
5114843 5116144 you do care about.
5117579 5119180 Go fuck yourself, Hans.
5121282 5123284 Did you hear that? He just let the guy die, man.
5123318 5124886 He just gave him up. Give me that headset.
5125887 5128223 -That's like pulling the trigger yourself. -Christ, man.
5128256 5129357 Can't you see what's happening?
5129390 5130859 -Can't you read between the lines? -That's cold.
5130892 5131993 -Is this on the right channel? -Yes, sir.
5132026 5134729 -He did everything he could to save him. -(sighs)
5134762 5137265 If he gave himself up, they'd both be dead right now.
5137298 5139601 No way, man. No way. They'd be talking to us.
5139634 5141469 Listen, you tell this partner of yours, pal,
5141503 5143471 to stay the hell out of this from now on. You hear me?
5143505 5145306 Because if he doesn't, I'm gonna nail him, boy.
5145340 5147275 I'm really gonna nail his ass now. Believe me.
5147308 5148676 The man is hurtin'.
5148710 5150612 He is alone, tired,
5150645 5152514 and he hasn't seen diddly-squat
5152547 5153948 from anybody down here.
5153982 5155950 Now, you're gonna stand there and tell me
5155984 5158253 that he's gonna give a damn about what you'll do to him
5158286 5159821 if he makes it out alive?
5159854 5162757 Why don't you wake up and smell what you're shoveling?
5162790 5164726 You listen to me, Sergeant.
5164759 5168229 Anytime you wanna go home, you consider yourself dismissed.
5168263 5169631 No, sir.
5169664 5171766 You couldn't drag me away.
5171799 5173234 HANS (on radio): Attention, police.
5174536 5176738 Attention, police.
5176771 5178606 -This is Sergeant Al Powell-- -Give me that.
5179707 5182510 This is, uh-- This is, uh, Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.
5182544 5183511 Who is this?
5183545 5185313 This is Hans Gruber.
5186714 5188249 I assume you realize the futility
5188283 5189617 of direct action against me.
5189651 5191819 We have no wish for further loss of life.
5191853 5194989 Well, uh, what is it you do wish for, Mr. Gruber?
5195023 5197859 I have comrades-in-arms around the world
5197892 5199594 languishing in prison.
5199627 5202330 The American State Department enjoys rattling its saber
5202363 5204732 for its own ends. Now it can rattle it for me.
5206701 5208770 The following people are to be released
5208803 5210004 from their captors.
5210838 5212607 In Northern Ireland, the seven members
5212640 5214042 of the New Provo Front.
5214075 5215610 In Canada,
5215643 5218746 the five imprisoned leaders of Liberte de Quebec.
5218780 5221616 In Sri Lanka, the nine members
5221649 5222984 of the Asian Dawn movement.
5223017 5224452 What the fuck?
5224485 5226854 (mouthing words)
5226888 5228623 I read about them in Time magazine.
5229657 5233528 When these revolutionary brothers and sisters are free,
5233561 5236664 the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof,
5236698 5238666 and they will accompany us in helicopters
5238700 5241035 to the Los Angeles International Airport,
5241069 5243371 where they will be given further instructions.
5243404 5245406 You have two hours to comply.
5246240 5249310 Wait a minute. Mr. Gruber, this is crazy.
5249344 5251079 I-I-I don't have the authority.
5251112 5252947 I-I can't authorize-- Two hours is not enough.
5252981 5255049 -(transmission cuts out) -Hel-- Hello?
5255083 5256284 Hello?
5257485 5258553 Danny, did you get all that?
5258586 5259954 Let's go. We gotta make some calls.
5261122 5262624 Do you think they'll even try to do it?
5263625 5264525 Who cares?
5267695 5269631 Theo, are we on schedule?
5269664 5271599 One more to go, then it's up to you.
5271633 5273468 And you better be right, because it looks like
5273501 5275069 this last one's gonna take a miracle.
5275103 5278406 It's Christmas, Theo. It's the time of miracles.
5278439 5281776 So be of good cheer and call me when you hit the last lock.
5283044 5286414 Karl, hunt that little shit down
5286447 5288516 and get those detonators.
5288549 5289984 Fritz is checking the explosives.
5290018 5292754 I'll check the explosives. You just get the detonators.
5293755 5295089 Hey, Powell, you out there?
5296624 5298359 I'm here, John. I'm here.
5299160 5300962 You gotta believe me. There was nothing I could do.
5303431 5306000 Well, it's gonna be both our asses if you're wrong.
5306034 5307368 I hear you.
5314008 5315977 Did you catch that bullshit Hans was running?
5317445 5318713 It doesn't make sense, man.
5319981 5321149 Hey, don't ask me, man.
5321182 5323951 I'm just a desk jockey who was on my way home when you rang.
5323985 5325653 The way you drove that car,
5325687 5327622 I figured you for the street, Al.
5327655 5330692 POWELL: In my youth. In my youth.
5330725 5334762 ...and author of Hostage Terrorist, Terrorist Hostage:
5334796 5336698 A Study in Duality.
5336731 5338466 Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we expect
5338499 5339867 in the next few hours?
5339901 5341469 Well, Gail, by this time
5341502 5343071 the hostages should be going through
5343104 5345673 the early stages of the "Helsinki Syndrome."
5345707 5349077 -As in Helsinki, Sweden. -HASSELDORF: Finland.
5349110 5351879 Basically, it's when the hostages
5351913 5353881 and the terrorists go through a sort of
5353915 5357785 psychological transference and a projection of dependency.
5357819 5360888 A strange sort of trust and bond develops.
5360922 5363157 We've had situations where the hostages
5363191 5365860 have embraced their captors after their release
5365893 5368129 and even corresponded with them in prison.
5368162 5370832 No, no. No, darling. "Asian Dawn."
5370865 5374535 Dawn. D-A-W-N.
5374569 5375770 -Sir? -I-- Yeah?
5375803 5379440 -Sir, the FBI is here. -Oh. The FBI is here now?
5379474 5381442 Yes, sir, right over there.
5381476 5383010 Hold this.
5383044 5384412 POWELL: You want a breath mint?
5387081 5388182 Uh, yeah. We got it.
5389751 5392053 Hey! How you doing, man?
5392086 5394622 I'm Agent Johnson. This is Special Agent Johnson.
5394655 5396858 -Oh. How you doing? -No relation.
5397925 5398860 I'm, uh--
5400828 5403464 I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD. I'm in charge here.
5404766 5405867 Not anymore.
5461255 5462190 Hi, there.
5463691 5464992 How you doing?
5468229 5469230 Oh!
5470998 5473968 Please, God, no. You're one of them, aren't you?
5474001 5476003 You're one of them.
5476037 5478806 Don't-- Don't kill me. Please, don't. Please!
5478840 5480608 Don't kill me. Don't kill me, please.
5480641 5482577 -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Relax. -Please, please, please.
5482610 5484078 Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.
5484111 5485913 I'm not gonna hurt you!
5488649 5489884 Oh, God.
5493754 5495022 What the fuck are you doing up here?
5495056 5496824 What were you looking for?
5496858 5498793 I managed to get out of there, and, uh--
5500161 5502797 Uh-- Well, I was just trying to get up on the roof
5502830 5505900 and see if I could signal for help, you know.
5506868 5509604 It's just through here. Why don't you come and help--
5509637 5511272 Whoa, whoa, whoa.
5511305 5512773 -Forget the roof. -Come on. Come on.
5512807 5514842 I said forget the roof. They got people all over it.
5517111 5518880 Come on. You wanna stay alive, you stay with me.
5522950 5524585 Well, the best way we can figure it is
5524619 5528122 we've got maybe 30 or 35 hostages up there,
5528155 5529891 probably on the 30th floor,
5529924 5531659 and maybe, uh, I don't know,
5531692 5533794 seven or eight terrorists up there.
5533828 5536063 Sounds like an A-7 scenario.
5536097 5538199 Thank you. We'll handle it from here.
5538232 5541669 When we commandeer your men, we'll try and let you know.
5541702 5543371 Aren't you forgetting something?
5543404 5544672 Such as?
5544705 5546240 What about John McClane?
5546274 5548242 He's the reason why we have the information
5548276 5549143 we have up until now.
5549176 5551612 He's also the reason why you're facing
5551646 5553114 seven terrorists instead of 12.
5553147 5555716 He's inside? Who is he?
5555750 5557184 Well, he might be a cop.
5557218 5558686 I don't know. We're checking on that.
5558719 5559954 One of yours?
5559987 5561222 No. No way.
5566827 5567762 Do you smoke?
5569163 5570131 Yeah.
5575703 5576704 Thanks.
5581342 5583778 You don't work for Nakatomi.
5587782 5589684 And if you're not one of them--
5592853 5594121 I'm a cop from New York.
5596157 5597091 New York?
5598092 5599894 Yeah.
5599927 5601963 Got invited to the Christmas party by mistake.
5602997 5603931 Who knew?
5608269 5609904 (Hans chuckling)
5611138 5612239 Yeah.
5612273 5614075 It's better than being caught with your pants down, huh?
5623918 5625353 I'm John McClane.
5626887 5627989 You're, uh--
5629790 5630858 Clay.
5633327 5634695 Bill Clay.
5640735 5642069 You know how to use a handgun, Bill?
5644171 5646307 I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.
5646340 5648442 You know that game with the guns that shoot red paint?
5648476 5650778 Probably seems kind of stupid to you.
5652813 5653914 -Well... -(cylinder clicking)
5656784 5658319 ...time for the real thing, Bill.
5667294 5668696 All you gotta do is pull the trigger.
5669797 5670464 Come on.
5679173 5680908 (speaking German)
5683878 5684912 (cocks gun)
5690017 5691018 Put down the gun...
5692186 5694255 and give me my detonators.
5698893 5699994 Well, well, well.
5702096 5703130 Hans.
5704131 5706801 Put it down now.
5710471 5712106 That's pretty tricky with that accent.
5714041 5716343 You oughta be on fucking TV with that accent.
5719346 5721148 But what do you want with the detonators, Hans?
5723350 5725086 I already used all the explosives.
5728289 5729323 Or did I?
5731125 5732860 -I'm going to count to three. -Yeah.
5733661 5735930 -Like you did with Takagi? -(clicks)
5735963 5736864 Oops.
5737865 5738532 (clicking)
5738566 5740201 No bullets.
5740234 5742103 You think I'm fucking stupid, Hans?
5742136 5743270 (elevator dings)
5743304 5744305 You were saying?
5746273 5748109 (yelling)
5760554 5761789 (grunts)
5769230 5770965 (shouts in German)
5790484 5792286 (gunfire)
5799260 5800461 Karl.
5800494 5801862 (in German)
5801896 5803330 (gunfire continues)
5809603 5811272 Shoot the glass.
5844638 5846173 Jesus Christ!
5858619 5860554 (clattering)
5875369 5878339 Smile, Karl. We're back in business.
5881075 5884411 ...is the last resort of diplomacy.
5884445 5887314 Then couldn't we just as well say
5887348 5891118 that terrorism has an equal claim on being that too?
5891151 5893087 You got something. Tell me you got something.
5893120 5895990 Just McClane's name, badge number, employment record,
5896023 5898525 vital statistics and his family's home address...
5899627 5901161 right here in LA.
5902630 5903530 Whoa!
5904531 5905933 (elevator bell dings)
5908736 5910604 HANS: Go to work.
5910638 5911672 Got it.
5924652 5928055 God, that man looks really pissed.
5930157 5931558 He's still alive.
5932626 5933560 What?
5935029 5938098 Only John can drive somebody that crazy.
5941068 5942369 (panting)
5942403 5943971 (grunts)
5953647 5956116 -(beeping) -THEO: Hans.
5956150 5957351 You better heat up that miracle,
5957384 5959186 because we just broke through on number six,
5959219 5962523 and the electromagnetic came down like a fucking anvil.
5962556 5965225 Have a look at what our friends outside are doing,
5965259 5966260 and I'll be right up.
5967294 5969530 (water running)
5969563 5971365 POWELL (on radio): Hey, John?
5971398 5973367 John McClane, you still with us?
5973400 5974401 Yeah.
5975235 5978072 But all things being equal, I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
5979807 5981508 Chalk up two more bad guys.
5982376 5984678 POWELL: Well, the boys down here will be glad to hear that.
5986280 5988482 You know, we got a pool going on you.
5988515 5990184 What kind of odds am I gettin'?
5990217 5991685 POWELL: You don't want to know.
5991719 5994321 Put me down for 20. I'm good for it.
5998225 6000561 McCLANE: Hey, Powell, you got flat feet?
6003564 6005532 What the hell you talking about, man?
6005566 6007634 Something had to get you off the street.
6008435 6009670 POWELL: What's the matter? You don't think
6009703 6011405 jockeying papers across a desk
6011438 6012606 is a noble effort for a cop?
6015175 6016176 McCLANE: No.
6019713 6021181 I had an accident.
6021215 6022716 McCLANE: The way you drive, I can see why.
6023550 6027321 What'd you do, run over your captain's foot with a car?
6031291 6032326 I shot a kid.
6033894 6035629 He was 13 years old.
6037431 6039466 Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.
6039500 6041101 He had a ray gun. It looked real enough.
6044571 6046573 You know, when you're a rookie, they can teach you everything
6046607 6048442 about being a cop, except how to live
6048475 6049443 with a mistake.
6054214 6055816 Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself to draw
6055849 6057451 my gun on anybody again.
6061789 6063190 McCLANE: Sorry, man.
6064758 6067394 Hey, man, how could you know?
6069730 6071265 I feel like shit anyway.
6074735 6076303 Well, then this won't matter.
6077137 6080407 The LAPD is not calling the shots down here anymore.
6083444 6084645 Feds?
6084678 6086346 You got it.
6087714 6090551 All right, those are the city engineers.
6090584 6092820 -(high-pitched beeping) -Wait.
6092853 6094455 They're going into the street circuits.
6095589 6097724 Those guys in the suits-- I don't know who they are.
6097758 6098892 HANS: That's the FBI.
6100027 6103664 They're ordering the others to cut the building's power.
6103697 6105566 Regular as clockwork.
6107301 6109403 Or a time lock.
6109436 6111338 HANS: Precisely.
6111371 6113774 The circuits that cannot be cut
6113807 6115375 are cut automatically
6115409 6118278 in response to a terrorist incident.
6118312 6120848 You asked for miracles, Theo. I give you
6120881 6124451 the FBI.
6124485 6126453 I said I want the friggin' building shut down.
6126487 6128689 I got a problem. I got a switch here--
6128722 6131191 I don't give two shits about your switch!
6131225 6132559 -I want the building out. -MAN: Hold on!
6132593 6134294 -Dark. D-A-R-K! -You don't understand.
6134328 6136230 -You can't do it from here. -Yeah, you could.
6136263 6137798 It can't be done from here.
6137831 6138765 I could just-- I got the radio.
6138799 6140834 We can't do it from down here I'm telling you.
6140868 6143370 It's gotta be done from downtown.
6143403 6144938 They've gotta take out a whole city grid.
6144972 6146907 We're talking ten square blocks.
6146940 6147875 -Ten blocks? -Yeah.
6147908 6150310 Johnson, that's crazy. It's Christmas Eve, man.
6150344 6152579 -There's thousands of people-- -JOHNSON: You have to go wider.
6152613 6155482 -Look. I need authorization. -Authorization?
6155516 6157451 How about the United States fucking government?
6157484 6158252 Hey.
6158285 6160721 Lose the grid or you lose your job.
6167027 6168028 -Yeah, Central? -MAN: Yeah?
6168061 6171298 Uh, yeah, this is Walt, uh, down at Nakatomi.
6171331 6172466 Uh, say, listen.
6172499 6174001 Uh, would it be possible for you
6174034 6176503 to turn off grid 212?
6176537 6179506 -Are you crazy? -Maybe I should call the mayor.
6179540 6180774 No shit, it's my ass.
6180807 6183277 I got a big problem down here. Shut it down.
6183310 6184511 Shut it down now.
6189316 6191985 FEMALE COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Emergency lighting activated.
6192019 6194922 Powell. Powell, talk to me. What's going on here?
6194955 6196857 POWELL: Ask the FBI.
6196890 6199326 They got the universal terrorist playbook,
6199359 6201595 and they're running it step by step.
6203730 6205732 THEO: It's gonna go. It's gonna go!
6205766 6208902 -(latches unlocking) -Yes!
6208936 6210671 (alarm blaring)
6213040 6216243 ("Ode to Joy" plays)
6225052 6227387 (alarm stops)
6231792 6232926 Merry Christmas.
6235729 6238065 Those bastards are probably pissing in their pants right now.
6238098 6239866 ROBINSON: The mayor's gonna have my ass.
6246907 6248275 Whoo!
6261588 6264391 Well, what are we gonna do now?
6264424 6266927 Arrest them for not paying their electric bill?
6266960 6268562 We've shut them down.
6268595 6271932 We let 'em sweat for a while, then we give 'em helicopters.
6271965 6273533 Right up the ass.
6277037 6278739 This is Agent Johnson.
6278772 6280474 No, the other one.
6280507 6281875 I want that air support ready to lift off
6281908 6283610 in five minutes.
6283644 6285879 Damn right. Fully armed. We're on the way.
6290651 6294554 (snickering softly) Oh, yeah!
6296590 6298725 I wish to talk to the FBI.
6301528 6303463 This is Special Agent Johnson of the FBI.
6304331 6306099 The State Department has arranged
6306133 6307968 for the return of your comrades.
6308001 6310737 Helicopters are en route as you requested.
6310771 6313073 HANS: I hear you. We'll be ready.
6313106 6315609 By the time he figures out what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.
6315642 6317811 When they touch down, we'll blow the roof.
6317844 6319579 They'll spend a month sifting through the rubble.
6319613 6321348 And by the time they figure out what went wrong...
6322149 6325619 we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20 percent.
6330424 6332092 (groans)
6332125 6333026 Powell.
6334027 6335762 Yo, Powell, you got a minute?
6337564 6338632 I'm here, John.
6341068 6343470 Listen, man, I'm starting to get a bad feeling up here.
6344705 6346740 I want you to do something for me.
6346773 6347874 Um-- (clears throat)
6349543 6351611 I want you to find my wife. Don't ask me how.
6351645 6353647 By then, you'll know how.
6353680 6356817 Uh... I want you to tell her something.
6358218 6359619 I want you to tell her that...
6360821 6361822 um--
6367094 6368929 Tell her it took me a while to figure out
6369930 6373100 what a jerk I've been, but, um--
6375168 6376470 but that--
6380607 6382976 that when things started to pan out for her,
6383009 6383977 I should've...
6385645 6387447 been more supportive,
6387481 6388482 and, uh...
6389983 6391551 and I just should've been behind her more.
6392652 6394454 (panting)
6395689 6396857 Oh, shit.
6399793 6401595 Tell her that, um--
6402829 6406066 that she's the best thing that ever happened to a bum like me.
6409136 6411872 She's heard me say "I love you" a thousand times.
6414074 6415842 She never heard me say, "I'm sorry."
6417878 6419045 And I want you to tell her that, Al.
6419079 6420547 I want you to tell her that, uh...
6421815 6424451 "John said that he was sorry."
6425252 6426219 Okay?
6427587 6428588 You got that, man?
6429589 6430857 POWELL: Yeah, I got it, John.
6432058 6433660 But you can tell her that yourself.
6434828 6437531 You just watch your ass, and you'll make it out of there. You hear me?
6439199 6441668 McCLANE: Well, I guess that's up to the man upstairs.
6445272 6446173 POWELL: John?
6447307 6448175 John?
6448975 6451511 What the fuck were you doing upstairs, Hans?
6454648 6457017 -POWELL: John? -No, Al, listen.
6457050 6458718 Listen, just lay off for a while.
6460720 6462088 I gotta go check on something.
6466226 6468695 -THORNBURG: One minute. That's all I'm asking. -(speaking Spanish)
6468728 6471598 One minute just to speak to you. All right. All right.
6471631 6472999 All right. Get back. Get back.
6473033 6475168 -Off. Off. All right. All right. -(continues in Spanish)
6475202 6478271 Look, you let me in right now, or I call the INS.
6478305 6479606 Comprende?
6481308 6482976 Look, this is the last time
6483009 6485078 these kids are gonna have to speak to their parents.
6488215 6489783 All right?
6489816 6491918 All right. Come on. Come on.
6491952 6494254 (steam hissing)
6502696 6504264 What were you doing, Hans?
6504297 6505665 What were you doing?
6520981 6522883 (beeping)
6527954 6530724 Jesus, Mary, mother of God.
6534895 6536997 Powell, Powell, listen to me! It's a double cross!
6537030 6538698 The whole roof of the building's wired to--
6542068 6543203 POWELL: John.
6545705 6547140 -John. -(radio clatters)
6547173 6550010 John, come in. Did you get that?
6550043 6551845 No. Something about a double cross.
6551878 6553647 (helicopters approaching)
6553680 6554848 Tell me about it.
6561254 6563023 We are both professionals.
6565892 6567127 This is personal.
6568662 6569863 Oh.
6571998 6573600 (yelling)
6591251 6592218 They're coming.
6594020 6595922 -Choppers are coming. -Okay.
6595956 6598858 Time to gather your flock, Miss Gennero.
6599926 6602963 THORNBURG (on TV): You know, your mom and dad are very important people.
6602996 6604197 They're very brave people.
6605899 6607667 So is there something you would like to say to them
6607701 6608802 if they're watching?
6610170 6611938 Come home.
6621247 6622415 Mrs. McClane.
6626052 6628655 How nice to make your acquaintance.
6629889 6632759 (screaming, shouting)
6632792 6634260 On your feet, everyone! To the roof!
6634294 6636329 Lock them up there and come right back.
6639366 6641401 MAN: Move! Come on! Let's move!
6644804 6645939 (grunts)
6665892 6668194 You should've heard your brother squeal
6668228 6670330 when I broke his fucking neck!
6673533 6676236 What do you figure the breakage?
6676269 6678171 Figure we take out the terrorists,
6678204 6682275 lose 20, 25 percent of the hostages... tops.
6682308 6683376 I can live with that!
6684778 6686046 Keep this thing on the deck.
6686079 6689449 They're expecting transports, not gunships.
6701361 6704064 Move it! Come on! Move!
6704097 6705031 Come on! Come on!
6705065 6706266 Move it!
6707500 6709035 Let's go! Move!
6712972 6715975 Theo. A little bonus for us.
6716009 6717110 Please, sit down.
6717143 6718845 -Sit down. -Hey!
6718878 6720947 A policeman's wife might come in handy.
6720980 6722982 McClane, I have some news for you.
6724451 6725485 McClane.
6726886 6727921 (Karl grunts)
6733426 6735328 (groans)
6737097 6738498 -Come on! Move, move! -(hostages screaming)
6741134 6742102 Come on!
6754614 6756349 Motherfucker, I'll kill you!
6760186 6761488 -(beeping) -Armed.
6762522 6764124 -The truck? -The truck.
6771898 6774134 After all your posturing,
6774167 6775468 all your little speeches,
6775502 6777403 you're nothing but a common thief.
6778905 6781074 I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.
6781107 6782509 And since I'm moving up to kidnapping,
6782542 6783910 you should be more polite.
6787280 6789048 (grunts)
6791584 6793853 Motherfucker, I'm gonna kill you!
6793887 6795622 I'm gonna fucking cook you,
6795655 6797323 and I'm gonna fucking eat you!
6820413 6822015 I don't like this, Sarge.
6830089 6832592 (whooping)
6832625 6835628 Just like fuckin' Saigon, eh, slick?
6837530 6840066 I was in junior high, dickhead.
6857016 6859152 (panicked chattering)
6863556 6865892 (screaming)
6868428 6871297 Where's Holly? Where's Holly Gennero?
6871331 6873433 Holly Gennero! Where's Holly?
6873466 6875134 Where's Holly? Where is she?
6875168 6876536 -They took her! -Where?
6876569 6878404 -The vault! -Where is the vault?
6878438 6881241 The 30th floor. Up the stairs. They just took her!
6881274 6882675 (helicopters approaching)
6882709 6884477 Get downstairs, all of you!
6884510 6887547 The whole fuckin' roof is wired to blow. Get down!
6887580 6890984 Get down! Get the fuck downstairs!
6891017 6892185 (screaming, shouting)
6892218 6894487 They made us, Bureau. You got a terrorist shooting hostages.
6894520 6896022 I see it. Bank left.
6903363 6905031 Nail that sucker!
6905064 6907200 (screaming)
6913139 6916276 (groans) I'm on your side, you assholes!
6916309 6919345 Shit. Swing around again! I'll bag this little bastard.
6938698 6940667 What the fuck-- Jesus!
6942802 6945471 Oh, John, what the fuck are you doing?
6945505 6947507 How the fuck did you get into this shit?
6950143 6953446 (screaming, shouting continues)
6958518 6959652 There's something wrong.
6959686 6961421 They're coming back down.
6961454 6963690 -Blow the roof. -But Karl's up there!
6963723 6965124 Blow the roof!
6968394 6971431 I promise I will never even think
6971464 6973599 about going up in a tall building again.
6977370 6979272 Oh, God. Please don't let me die.
6986679 6989415 (explosion)
6992552 6993419 Holy shit!

7071564 7073566 Holy Christ!
7075334 7077870 We're gonna need some more FBI guys, I guess.
7077904 7079839 (gasping)
7087313 7088514 (dings)
7090683 7092585 Jesus fucking Christ!
7104630 7106466 (clattering)
7114273 7115141 (engine starts)
7118911 7121481 -What the fuck is going on? -(tires screeching)
7123616 7125585 HOLLY: What are you gonna do, sit here while the building
7125618 7126752 falls down around your ears?
7126786 7129722 (man shouting in German)
7135761 7138731 -Shit! -Hey! All right!
7138764 7140733 (shouts in French)
7141934 7143769 McClane: Hang on, baby.
7143803 7145771 Hang on, honey.
7145805 7147406 Oh, God.

7209001 7210002 Jesus.
7211404 7212438 Hi, honey.
7235094 7236963 So that's what this was all about?
7236996 7239031 A fucking robbery?
7239065 7240533 Put down the gun.
7242568 7244570 Why did you have to nuke the whole building, Hans?
7244604 7247673 When you steal $600, you can just disappear.
7247707 7250743 When you steal 600 million, they will find you,
7250776 7253446 unless they think you're already dead.
7253479 7255314 Put down the gun.
7262755 7264390 (gasps)
7265758 7267493 HANS: Nein! This is mine.
7270663 7271597 You got me.
7272398 7275501 HANS: Still the cowboy, Mr. McClane.
7275534 7277403 Americans, all alike.
7277436 7279071 Well, this time, John Wayne does not walk off
7279105 7281340 into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
7281374 7283075 That's Gary Cooper, asshole.
7283109 7284977 Enough jokes.
7285011 7287613 You'd have made a pretty good cowboy yourself, Hans.
7288748 7290016 HANS: Oh, yes.
7290049 7291817 What was it you said to me before?
7293552 7296555 Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
7296589 7297957 (McClane laughing)
7317410 7318077 Holly!
7324450 7325785 Happy trails, Hans.
7330856 7332391 (screams)

7451577 7453112 -Did they frighten you at all? Any comment? -It was terrible.
7453145 7454547 I really don't wanna talk about it.
