4654954 4658479 Strangely, the Volksfrei<br />leadership issued<br />a communiqué an hour ago...
4658566 4661134 stating that Gruber had been<br />expelled from that organization.

4670666 4672755 Remember that plastic explosive<br />I told you about?Yeah.
4672842 4675888 There you go.<br />Is the building on fire?
4675975 4679936 No, but it's gonna<br />need a paint job and<br />a shitload of screen doors.
4680023 4681938 Our spotters say<br />you got two<br />with that blast.

4705744 4708094 This is Deputy Chief of Police<br />Dwayne T. Robinson,
4708181 4710444 and I am in charge<br />of this situation.
4710531 4714405 Oh, you're in charge?<br />Well, I got some bad news<br />for you, Dwayne.
4714492 4717713 From up here<br />it doesn't look like<br />you're in charge of jack shit.

4786390 4789741 It's not what I want.<br />It's what I can give you.
4797575 4800012 Look, let's be straight,<br />okay?
4800099 4804538 It's obvious you're not some<br />dumb schmuck up here to snatch<br />a few purses. Am I right?
4804625 4808281 - You're very perceptive.<br />- I watch 60 Minutes.

5036944 5039556 Now tell these guys<br />where the detonators are<br />so no one else gets hurt.
5039643 5042559 I'm putting my life<br />on the line for you, pal.
5042646 5045214 Ellis, listen to me<br />very carefully.John--

5396608 5399611 I'm, uh--
5399698 5403267 I'm Dwayne Robinson, L.A.P.D.<br />I'm in charge here.

5480518 5484348 Relax. Relax.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you!
5487220 5489135 Oh, God.
5492661 5495620 What the fuck<br />are you doing up here?<br />What were you looking for?
5495707 5499363 I managed to get out of there,<br />and, uh--
5499450 5501670 Well, I was just trying<br />to get up on the roof...
5501757 5505630 and see if I could<br />signal for help, you know.
5505717 5507763 It's just through here.<br />Why don't you come and help--
5507850 5511418 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />Forget the roof.Come on. Come on.
5511506 5515901 I said forget the roof.<br />They got people all over it.
5515988 5517947 Come on.<br />You wanna stay alive,<br />you stay with me.
5521124 5523430 Well, the best way<br />we can figure it is...
5523518 5526738 we've got maybe<br />30 or 35 hostages up there...
5526825 5529045 probably on the 30th floor,
5529132 5532396 and maybe, I don't know,<br />seven or eight terrorists<br />up there.
5532483 5534833 Sounds like an A-7 scenario.
5534920 5537009 Thank you.<br />We'll handle it from here.
5537096 5540360 When we commandeer your men,<br />we'll try and let you know.
5540447 5542841 Aren't you<br />forgetting something?Such as?
5542928 5545191 What about John McClane?
5545278 5548412 He's the reason why<br />we have the information<br />we have up until now.
5548499 5551850 He's also the reason<br />why you're facing<br />seven terrorists instead of 12.
5551937 5554505 He's inside?<br />Who is he?
5554592 5557290 Well, he might be a cop.<br />I don't know.<br />We're checking on that.
5557377 5559815 One of yours?No. No way.
5563949 5566212 Do you smoke?
5567344 5569259 Yeah.
5574177 5576092 Thanks.

5631147 5633062 Bill Clay.
5639503 5641244 You know how to use<br />a handgun, Bill?
5642985 5645117 I spent a weekend<br />at a combat ranch.
5645204 5647293 You know that game<br />with the guns<br />that shoot red paint?
5647380 5650253 Probably seems<br />kind of stupid to you.
5651384 5653299 Well,
5655127 5656912 time for the real thing, Bill.
5665834 5669011 All you gotta do<br />is pull the trigger.<br />Come on.

5709312 5712881 That's pretty tricky<br />with that accent.
5712968 5714796 You oughta be on fucking TV<br />with that accent.
5718147 5721716 But what do you want<br />with the detonators, Hans?
5721803 5725894 I already used<br />all the explosives.
5725981 5727852 Or did I?
5729898 5731856 I'm going<br />to count to three.Yeah.
5731943 5734467 Like you did with Takagi?[ Clicks ]
5734554 5737470 - Oops.<br />- [ Clicking ]
5737557 5740865 No bullets. You think<br />I'm fucking stupid, Hans?

5883268 5886097 Then couldn't<br />we just as well say...
5886184 5888883 that terrorism<br />has an equal claim<br />on being that too?
5888970 5891798 You got something.<br />Tell me you got something.
5891886 5894714 Just McClane's<br />name, badge number,<br />employment record,

5909294 5911166 Got it.
5923526 5927051 God, that man<br />looks really pissed.
5928792 5933579 He's still alive.What?
5933666 5937366 Only John can drive<br />somebody that crazy.

5952555 5955427 [ Beeping ] [ Theo ]<br />Hans.
5955514 5957908 You better heat up<br />that miracle, because we just<br />broke through on number six,
5957995 5960824 and the electromagnetic<br />came down like a fucking anvil.
5960911 5965872 Have a look at what<br />our friends outside are doing,<br />and I'll be right up.
5965960 5968484 [ Water Running ]
5968571 5971704 [ Powell ]<br />Hey, John? John McClane,<br />you still with us?
5971791 5974098 Yeah.
5974185 5977275 But all things being equal,<br />I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
5978624 5981410 Chalk up two more bad guys.
5981497 5984979 Well, the boys down here<br />will be glad to hear that.
5985066 5987285 You know, we got<br />a pool going on you.
5987372 5990462 What kind of odds<br />am I gettin'?You don't want to know.
5990549 5994075 Put me down for 20.<br />I'm good for it.
5994162 5996903 [ Chuckling ]
5996991 5999950 Hey, Powell,<br />you got flat feet?
6002344 6004346 What the hell<br />you talking about, man?
6004433 6007566 Something had to<br />get you off the street.
6007653 6009960 What's the matter?<br />You don't think jockeying<br />papers across a desk...
6010047 6012267 is a noble effort<br />for a cop?
6013790 6015705 No.
6018534 6022494 I had an accident. The way you drive,<br />I can see why.
6022581 6025715 What'd you do,<br />run over your captain's foot<br />with a car?
6028935 6030807 I shot a kid.
6032809 6036465 He was 13 years old.
6036552 6038728 It was dark.<br />I couldn't see him.<br />He had a ray gun.
6038815 6040643 It looked real enough.
6043472 6046214 You know, when you're a rookie,<br />they can teach you everything<br />about being a cop...
6046301 6048477 except how to live<br />with a mistake.
6053177 6056702 Anyway, I just couldn't<br />bring myself to draw<br />my gun on anybody again.
6060576 6063448 Sorry, man.
6063535 6065929 Hey, man,<br />how could you know?
6068584 6071152 I feel like shit anyway.
6072979 6075069 Well, then this won't matter.
6075156 6079508 The L.A.P.D. is not calling<br />the shots down here anymore.
6082206 6084817 - Feds?<br />- You got it.
6086558 6089300 All right, those<br />are the city engineers.
6091520 6093870 They're going into<br />the street circuits.
6093957 6097830 Those guys in the suits--<br />I don't know who they are. [ Hans ] That's the F.B.I.
