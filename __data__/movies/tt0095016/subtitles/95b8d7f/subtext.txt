22564 24475 <i>Released in July, 1988...</i>
24566 27068 Die Hard <i>was the third feature<br />from director John McTiernan.</i>
27152 29359 <i>His first film was</i> Nomads...
29446 31030 <i>An independent thriller<br />released in early 1986.</i>
31114 33658 Nomads <i>starred Pierce Brosnan,<br />Lesley-Anne Down and Adam Ant.</i>
33742 35653 <i>McTiernan and Brosnan would reunite,</i>
35744 37996 <i>for the 1999 remake of</i><br />The Thomas Crown Affair.
38080 40874 <i>When he was president of 20th Century Fox,<br />producer Lawrence Gordon saw</i> Nomads
40958 43120 <i>which he thought was<br />"scary and well-shot."</i>
43210 44711 <i>As a producer, he hired McTiernan<br />to direct</i> Predator.
44795 47046 Predator <i>was McTiernan's<br />first studio film and a hit</i>
47130 48882 <i>when it was released<br />in the summer of 1987.</i>
48966 50717 <i>It was produced<br />by Gordon and Joel Silver.</i>
50801 52760 <i>It also marked McTiernan's<br />first collaboration</i>
52844 56055 <i>with</i> Die Hard <i>special effects coordinator<br />Al DiSarro and editor John F. Link.</i>
56139 58558 EDITOR JOHN F. LINK: When I first went<br />to work with him
58642 60560 his secretary gave me<br />a tape of his first film,
60644 63605 I ran it and said, "You've got<br />to be kidding!" I couldn't understand it!
63689 66566 <i>DiSarro joined the</i> Predator <i>production<br />toward the end of his tenure</i>
66650 69527 <i>as Special Effects Coordinator<br />on the television series</i> The A-Team.
69611 71818 <i>It was his first feature in that role.</i>
71905 74491 Special Effects Coordinator AI DiSarro:<br />I worked with McTiernan very closely,
74575 77237 As a TV man stepping<br />into the world of features...
77327 79078 I was surprised when the film<br />was such a big hit!
79162 81456 <i>Before</i> Die Hard,<br /><i>Steven E. De Souza had worked on</i>
81540 83583 48 HRS. <i>And</i> Commando<br /><i>for Lawrence Gordon and Joel Silver.</i>
83667 86920 Screenwriter Steven E. De Souza:<br /><i>48 HRS.</i> was my first feature for them,
87004 89245 and my first feature, period,
89339 91883 I showed I could handle suspense<br />and adventure and still make it funny,
91967 94010 <i>Roderick Thorp published</i><br />Nothing Lasts Forever <i>in 1979</i>
94094 96513 <i>as the sequel to</i> The Detective,<br /><i>his 1966 best-seller.</i>
96597 99098 <i>Thorp has confessed that<br />the idea began as a dream he had</i>
99182 102477 <i>in which he saw a man being chased<br />through a building by men with guns.</i>
102561 105146 <i>He dreamt this on a night in 1975,<br />the night he saw</i> The Towering Inferno,
105230 107774 <i>According to Thorp, when producer<br />Lawrence Gordon looked at the cover,</i>
107858 109859 <i>and saw the burning building<br />and helicopter</i>
109943 112355 <i>he said, "I don't<br />need to read it. Buy it."</i>
112446 114906 <i>The film version of</i> The Detective<br /><i>starred Frank Sinatra</i>
114990 116950 <i>who later played a cop in</i><br />The First Deadly Sin,
117034 119953 <i>In that movie, Bruce Willis was<br />an extra who passes Sinatra.</i>
120037 121996 De Souza:<br />Basically, Bruce walked past the guy
122080 124541 who had previously played the role<br />he would eventually play!
124625 127168 Producer Lawrence Gordon:<br />Fox originally passed on <i>Die Hard, ,,</i>
127252 128708 in novel form,
128795 131256 I convinced Fox's president at the time,<br />Leonard Goldberg
131340 133251 that they had made a mistake,
133342 136302 Later, it was Barry Diller's decision<br />to pay Bruce $5 million.
136386 138054 That was quite a large sum in those days.
138138 141438 But it was an important project for Fox;<br />they needed a summer film.
141558 144852 Production Designer Jackson DeGovia:<br />The design of the movie is "hopped-up", ,,
144936 147974 like a [James] Bond film,<br />but without the gadgets,
148065 151765 The Nakatomi sets have, as Joel Silver<br />likes to say, "exaggerated realism"â€¦
180055 182797 <i>Bonnie Bedelia was nominated<br />for an Academy Award,</i>
182891 186509 <i>for her performance as race-car driver<br />Shirley "Cha Cha" Muldowney</i>
186603 188469 <i>in the 1983 film</i> Heart Like A Wheel.
188563 191681 <i>As a child in Manhattan,<br />she began her theatrical career</i>
191775 194312 <i>with ballet lessons<br />when she was four years old.</i>
194403 197771 <i>At the age often, she chose<br />to pursue acting instead of ballet.</i>
197864 200572 <i>In 1967, she was cast<br />opposite Louis Gossett Jr</i>
200659 203526 <i>in the two-character Broadway play</i><br />My Sweet Charlie.
203620 206362 <i>Her performance earned her<br />the Theater World Award.</i>
206456 209198 <i>Director Andre Gregory invited her<br />to Los Angeles</i>
209292 211624 <i>to join Gossett, Martin Sheen and others</i>
211712 214249 <i>in the city's first<br />classical repertory company.</i>
214339 217422 <i>In her second year in LA,<br />John Frankenheimer cast her</i>
217509 219420 <i>in her first film,</i> The Gypsy Moths
219511 222594 <i>costarring Gene Hackman,<br />Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr.</i>
222681 226845 <i>The Nakatomi Building is Fox Plaza,<br />now a landmark of the Los Angeles skyline.</i>
226935 229097 <i>It stands on a corner</i>
229187 232179 <i>of the 20th Century Fox<br />studio lot in Century City.</i>
232274 234766 <i>Production Designer Jackson DeGovia...</i>
234860 237727 <i>Transformed Fox Plaza's<br />unoccupied 33rd and 34th floors</i>
237946 240233 <i>into sections of the Nakatomi Building.</i>
240323 243941 <i>But the 30th floor was too large<br />to construct inside the real tower.</i>
244035 247494 <i>Instead, the 30th floor was built<br />inside Stage 15 on the Fox lot.</i>
247581 250243 <i>The set stood three stories high.</i>
250333 254076 <i>Surrounding the set was a cyclorama<br />displaying a view of Los Angeles</i>
254171 256754 <i>seen from the 34th floor of Fox Plaza</i>
256840 259582 <i>created by scenic artist Ed Strang<br />and his son Ron.</i>
259676 262839 <i>The backing could be lit from behind<br />in a variety of ways</i>
262929 265387 <i>to mark the passage of time.</i>
265474 268091 <i>It was painted<br />with certain parts out of focus</i>
268185 270426 <i>just as the human eye<br />would see the scene.</i>
270520 272682 <i>DEGOVIA: What these people did<br />was amazing.</i>
272773 277267 <i>To do this kind of large-scale work,<br />you must have talent equal to the task.</i>
369953 372121 De Souza:<br />McTiernan and I hit it off very well,
372205 375041 John began as a writer, and therefore<br />you could have a conversation
375125 377460 about structure or dialogue<br />that was very concrete
377544 380206 whereas sometimes,<br />when you have talented directors
380297 382882 who are essentially shooters,<br />the conversation can be very fuzzy:
382966 385092 "We need a feeling of dread"<br />or "I see ominous."
385176 388221 <i>Because</i> Die Hard <i>is about the taking<br />and retaking of a skyscraper</i>
388305 390763 <i>it is about the control of space.</i>
390849 393601 <i>McTiernan begins establishing<br />the audience's sense of space</i>
393685 396479 <i>in the opening credits<br />before McClane ever enters the building.</i>
396563 398563 <i>The main title sequence is slowly paced.</i>
398648 401442 <i>The credits appear almost without<br />regard for the action they obscure.</i>
401526 404779 <i>There is little or no music. The sequence<br />feels natural. Open. Spacious.</i>
404863 407365 <i>This feeling of spaciousness<br />exists to be closed down</i>
407449 410066 <i>when McClane enters the building,</i>
410160 412743 <i>and when the terrorists seize it.</i>
412829 415581 DE SOUZA: I sometimes wondered<br />if the strategy of the picture
415665 417792 which was in many ways<br />to make it a throwback
417876 420413 to an earlier kind of picture,<br />was going to work.
420503 422088 Maybe the audience<br />would be too impatient,
422172 424048 There were periods where we all wondered
424132 425998 if it took too long to get started,
426092 428010 "Maybe we should murder someone<br />in the opening scene."
428094 431430 In this film, which is remembered as<br />this thrill-a-minute action picture
431514 435132 there's about 20 minutes before<br />anything violent or explosive happens,
435226 437520 But I think an atmosphere is built,<br />and you really identify
437604 439981 with Bruce's character as a real guy<br />with real problems.
440065 442523 I think that's half of it
442609 445027 because if you don't care<br />about somebody in the film
445111 447773 if you don't identify with somebody
447864 449657 you watch everything<br />very dispassionately,
449741 452785 <i>In his review,</i> Village Voice<br /><i>film critic David Edelstein wrote...</i>
452869 455452 <i>"The people who made this movie"</i>
455538 457790 <i>must have always wanted<br />to demolish a skyscraper</i>
457874 460877 <i>especially one of those high-tech,<br />glass-and-bronze monstrosities</i>
460961 462962 <i>an</i> arrogant <i>skyscraper,<br />like the Trump Tower."</i>
463046 465756 <i>McTiernan, DeGovia and<br />Director of Photography Jan De Bont...</i>
465840 468384 <i>Reflect the building's architecture<br />inside the building</i>
468468 470970 <i>through the art direction,<br />compositions and cinematography.</i>
471054 473723 <i>The building features<br />pronounced triangular formations...</i>
473807 476183 <i>Which run the height of the building...<br />Some 35 floors.</i>
476267 478811 <i>Similarly, DeGovia includes triangles<br />in many of his sets.</i>
478895 480636 <i>Some will be subtle</i>
480730 484108 <i>like the steps separating Hans<br />from his hostages on the 30th floor,</i>
484192 486485 <i>and the zigzagging angles<br />of the boardroom table</i>
486569 489106 <i>white some will be more stark</i>
489197 492325 <i>like the security guard's lobby terminal<br />and the Nakatomi logo itself</i>
492409 495411 <i>The triangle motif is also part<br />of the composition of the frames,</i>
495495 497987 <i>and of the photography itself</i>
498081 500333 <i>inside the building,<br />McTiernan and De Bont stage the actors</i>
500417 502752 <i>in triangular formations...<br />Most notably, the terrorists.</i>
502836 505828 <i>The camera movements themselves<br />can suggest a triangle</i>
505922 509258 <i>when McTiernan and De Bont combine pans,<br />(left and right camera movements).</i>
509342 511834 <i>And tilts (up and down camera movements).</i>
511928 514055 <i>In these shots, the camera starts<br />on one point</i>
514139 516182 <i>moves to a second,<br />and moves again to a third.</i>
516266 519185 <i>This helps define where the elements<br />in a scene are in relation to each other.</i>
519269 521260 <i>What's more, for filmmakers</i>
521354 524187 <i>as painters and theater directors<br />have often shown</i>
524274 526766 <i>triangles can be forceful elements<br />of an image.</i>
526860 529570 DEGOVIA: The reason you see<br />these archetypes in <i>Die Hard, ,,</i>
529654 532191 is that we had very little time,
532282 535534 I was brought in eight weeks before<br />principal photography was to start
535618 537404 which isn't much,
537495 540908 We were going with our gut,
540999 543411 <i>McClane is pushed to the left<br />in a long shot.</i>
543501 546414 <i>He is small against his surroundings.</i>
546504 549542 <i>The environment is more powerful<br />than he is.</i>
549632 553045 <i>McTiernan often frames Willis<br />near the left margin of the frame.</i>
553136 556379 <i>It deprives him of power,<br />as the right third of the frame</i>
556473 558714 <i>is often considered<br />the more powerful side.</i>
558808 561220 <i>Director Fred Zinnemann used<br />this technique</i>
561311 563348 <i>when framing Gary Cooper in</i> High Noon.
563438 566976 <i>This is one of several connections<br />between</i> High Noon <i>and</i> Die Hard,
567067 570276 <i>The security console is<br />a good example of the movie's use</i>
570361 574650 <i>of dramatic corners and triangles in its<br />compositions and camera movements.</i>
583833 586825 <i>Construction Coordinator<br />Bruce Gfeller's name</i>
586920 588911 <i>is worked into the movie several times.</i>
589005 590837 <i>This is one.</i>
600683 603892 <i>The console is a stark triangle<br />in the composition,</i>
603978 606185 <i>and also balances it.</i>
606272 609672 <i>It takes up the right side of the frame<br />as McClane takes up the left.</i>
650400 653483 <i>Silver, then an owner<br />of two Frank Lloyd Wright estates</i>
653570 656653 <i>wanted the Nakatomi sets<br />to bear the architect's influence.</i>
656739 660027 <i>DeGovia knew that Frank Lloyd Wright<br />and the Japanese</i>
660118 661869 <i>complement each other on several levels.</i>
661953 664741 DEGOVIA: Both have a passion<br />for organic materials,
664831 668040 so I designed the sets to include<br />wood, stone and concrete,
668126 671118 and traditional metals<br />such as copper, bronze and brass,
671212 673544 At the time, there was<br />a certain arrogance
673631 675998 associated with Japanese<br />corporate culture,
676092 678719 and there is a certain arrogance<br />associated with Wright.
678803 682216 Wright knew he was<br />the greatest architect of the century,
682307 685971 and the Japanese knew they were<br />a top industrial nation in the world,
686060 688927 <i>The arrogance of the Nakatomi<br />Corporation takes form</i>
689022 691639 <i>in one of DeGovia's set pieces<br />for the 30th floor:</i>
691733 695146 <i>a replica of Wright's</i> Fallingwater,<br /><i>a man-made, indoor waterfall.</i>
695236 698024 DEGOVIA: The arrogance<br />of the Nakatomi Corporation
698114 700526 is that they bought<br />this supreme cultural icon,
700617 703234 <i>But DeGovia is also quick to point out</i>
703328 705740 <i>a surprising philanthropic flip side</i>
705830 708117 <i>to Nakatomi's appropriation<br />of</i> Fallingwater.
708208 711043 DEGOVIA: Putting it on display within<br />a corporate high-rise made the piece
711127 713629 more accessible to more people<br />that would ever see it otherwise.
713713 715798 <i>A</i> rack focus <i>is when<br />the camera changes focus</i>
715882 718217 <i>between objects in the foreground<br />and in the background.</i>
718301 721387 <i>McTiernan often uses it to show<br />what his characters are noticing</i>
721471 724304 <i>instead of just cutting<br />to a point-of-view shot.</i>
745870 748658 <i>Sometimes McTiernan also uses<br />over-the-shoulder shots</i>
748748 751348 <i>to show the audience<br />something the character notices.</i>
755004 757917 <i>Joe Takagi is played by James Shigeta,<br />a native of Hawaii.</i>
758007 760419 <i>He began his career in show business</i>

763346 765883 <i>in Hawaii, the mainland and the Far East.</i>

861527 864519 <i>to say in images<br />what is not articulated by the dialogue.</i>
864614 868152 <i>Holly and McClane are separated<br />by an open doorway:</i>
868242 871610 <i>They are in different spaces<br />physically, and also emotionally.</i>
934559 936766 <i>McClane is now framed by the doorway.</i>
936853 939229 <i>He is confined in space...<br />And not for the last time, either.</i>
939313 941429 <i>Also, as elements of a composition</i>
941524 943525 <i>doorways imply crossroads or transitions.</i>
943609 945611 <i>How McClane decides<br />to answer Holly could alter</i>
945695 947529 <i>the course of the relationship...<br />And the story.</i>
947613 949198 <i>McTiernan often uses framing devices</i>
949282 951450 <i>like doorways, machines<br />and the</i> Fallingwater <i>replica</i>
951534 953400 <i>to confine McClane's image.</i>
953494 955662 <i>McClane is also often restricted<br />to the back of the frame</i>
955746 958707 <i>while doors, desks, railings<br />and other objects occupy the foreground.</i>
958791 960873 <i>These are all methods McTiernan uses</i>
960960 963170 <i>to deny McClane control<br />over his surroundings...</i>
963254 965631 <i>To confine him visually,<br />just as the story does literally.</i>
965715 968509 Screenwriter Steven E, De Souza:<br />This was a familial situation
968593 970834 unlike the usual situation in Hollywood.
970928 973847 I'd done many movies with these people,<br />and I was on the set a great deal,
973931 976389 This argument is the result<br />of an improvisation..,
976476 979889 I ran with Bruce and Bonnie Bedelia.
979979 983517 It led to a very authentic<br />domestic scene.
983608 985609 This you get when you have collaboration,
985693 989106 and don't put walls up<br />between all the contributors.
1053469 1056138 <i>Prior to his roles in</i> Witness,<br />The Money Pit <i>and</i> Die Hard...
1056222 1059099 <i>Alexander Godunov was famous<br />for his work on the ballet stage,</i>
1059183 1065054 <i>and for his 1979 defection<br />to the US from the Soviet Union.</i>
1065147 1068060 Actor Alexander Godunov:<br />When I was a child...
1068150 1071484 I used to play with toy pistols,
1071571 1074404 but shooting blanks out of a real gun
1074490 1077034 makes you think of<br />the tremendous power one can have,
1077118 1080156 and how easy it is<br />for one person to kill another,
1080246 1083580 After training during pre-production<br />with the gun,
1083666 1086078 and even when we started shooting...
1086168 1089035 I couldn't get the sense of power<br />out of my mind,
1089130 1092339 but, then again,<br />that's what my character is all about,
1092425 1095302 What really got to me<br />was that our producer [Joel Silver], ,,
1095386 1098013 came up to me after a couple of days<br />of working and said...
1098097 1100179 "You look like a professional now,"
1100266 1102809 It was strange because<br />I was comfortable with the gun,
1102893 1105260 and it made me uncomfortable<br />knowing that.
1106272 1109274 FILM EDITOR JOHN F. LINK: The pace<br />of the film was created by John...
1109358 1112146 But the tension was created<br />by Michael Kamen's score,
1112236 1115354 The minute they drive into the garage,<br />when the music starts
1115448 1117735 that sets it all up,
1117825 1121284 That creates the tension:<br />not the editing so much as the music,
1121370 1123281 The editing hopefully helps,
1123372 1125874 but even if it was the best-edited<br />sequence in the world..,

1135551 1137963 <i>The "Ode to Joy"</i>
1138054 1141718 <i>from the fourth movement of<br />Beethoven's</i> Ninth Symphony
1141807 1144674 <i>is the most developed theme in the score.</i>

1148230 1152224 <i>as he attaches it to the terrorists...<br />Specifically, Hans Gruber.</i>
1152318 1155527 KAMEN: We have to give credit<br />where credit is due:
1155613 1159151 to Beethoven and John McTiernan,
1159241 1163906 McTiernan insisted on using<br />Beethoven's <i>Ninth,</i> despite my objections,
1163996 1168536 I thought it was sacrilege<br />to use Beethoven in this action movie.
1168626 1173336 I told McTiernan, "I'll make mincemeat<br />out of Wagner and Strauss for you,
1173422 1175789 but why Beethoven?"
1175883 1180218 McTiernan explained because<br />Beethoven's <i>Ninth</i> was the theme used
1180304 1184343 to underscore the ultra-violence<br />in Stanley Kubrick's <i>A Clockwork Orange.</i>
1184433 1188677 <i>Kamen, a Kubrick fan, then agreed.</i>
1188771 1193265 KAMEN: As we found out in <i>Lethal Weapon,</i><br />all the <i>Die Hards</i> and others
1193359 1197728 the success of a movie depends<br />on the foulness of the bad guy,
1197822 1200735 And in this case,<br />we had a spectacular bad guy!
1200825 1203237 Our bad guys were the lineal descendants
1203327 1205944 of the bad guys in <i>Clockwork.</i>
1207415 1210407 <i>Here, the absence of music<br />creates suspense.</i>
1210501 1215587 <i>Kamen is one of the few composers<br />who understands the power of silence,</i>
1215673 1217466 <i>and uses it as an active part<br />of a sound track.</i>
1217550 1219551 <i>Three triangles:<br />the camera move, the terrorists,</i>
1219635 1221626 <i>and the security console.</i>
1236902 1238893 <i>John McTiernan is a naval history buff.</i>
1238988 1242106 <i>This is how sailors often descend<br />a staircase on a submarine.</i>
1260634 1264628 <i>Costume Designer Marylin Vance-Straker<br />dresses Willis in layers.</i>
1264722 1267510 <i>As the story progresses,<br />he loses clothing</i>
1267600 1269557 <i>which marks the passage of time.</i>
1269643 1274012 <i>It also exaggerates the contrast<br />between McClane and his surroundings:</i>
1274106 1277599 <i>He is stripped-down,<br />while Nakatomi is opulent, refined.</i>
1277693 1281561 <i>According to De Souza,<br />the filmmakers cast Willis as McClane</i>
1281655 1284449 <i>after they had been turned down<br />by Arnold Schwarzenegger...</i>
1284533 1288652 <i>Sylvester Stallone, Richard Gere<br />and Burt Reynolds.</i>
1289371 1292079 Actor Bruce Willis:<br />John McClane is an ordinary guy
1292166 1294292 who is thrown<br />into extraordinary circumstances,
1294376 1297664 He's not some supercop
1297755 1301089 some indestructible,<br />unemotional, unfeeling guy,
1301175 1305134 Production Designer Jackson DeGovia:<br />What sets McClane apart
1305221 1307132 is that he suffers,
1307223 1310142 DE SOUZA: On paper, these things may<br />have seemed like very thin ice,
1310226 1313139 for an actor wanting to play<br />heroic roles,
1313229 1316893 but these are actually the things<br />that made him so real and so heroic.
1318776 1322644 De Souza:<br />Karl's brother is the "dog heavy,"
1322738 1325150 That's an old Hollywood term that refers
1325241 1328825 to the third villain from the top.
1328911 1331496 It goes back to Westerns:<br />The main villain kills the sheriff
1331580 1334163 the second villain kills the deputy,
1334250 1337750 and the third villain does something<br />generically mean, like kick a dogâ€¦
1362111 1366025 <i>When McTiernan cuts to a new location,<br />he often starts in close,</i>
1366115 1368527 <i>and then gives us a wider view<br />of the action.</i>
1368617 1371109 <i>Many directors start<br />with an establishing shot,</i>
1371203 1373194 <i>and then cut in closer.</i>
1373289 1376289 <i>McTiernan's approach gives<br />the beginning of such sequences</i>
1376375 1378616 <i>a greater energy.</i>
1387720 1390764 <i>McClane... who is so often pushed<br />to one side of the screen...</i>
1390848 1393886 <i>Crosses the frame at select<br />dramatic moments like this one.</i>
1393976 1397354 <i>Photographically, the 30th floor is dense<br />with the shadows of venetian blinds.</i>
1397438 1400888 <i>The shadows cramp the frame, making<br />the 30th floor feel more enclosed.</i>
1402067 1403978 <i>One of Jan De Boot's greatest shots:</i>
1404069 1406936 <i>McClane is squeezed... trapped...<br />In a narrow space</i>
1407031 1410242 <i>while the shadows exaggerate the angle<br />and McClane's line of sight.</i>
1410326 1413364 <i>In 1988, McTiernan told</i><br />Variety <i>reporter Todd McCarthy...</i>
1413454 1415570 <i>"The sheer grit of Bruce's acting</i>
1415664 1418406 <i>along with Jan De Boot's<br />film noir lighting</i>
1418500 1421333 <i>make John McClane a memorable character</i>
1421420 1424788 <i>not unlike Bogart in</i> The African Queen."
1435184 1437310 DE SOUZA: When my son saw<br />Bruce Willis run
1437394 1440146 he grabbed my arm and said,<br />"Dad! The hero's chickenshit!"
1440230 1444895 The biggest problem was the trouble<br />Lloyd, Larry and Joel were having
1444985 1447602 casting the picture,
1447696 1450240 That due to our own sterling work<br />in previous years
1450324 1452235 making big, explosive action movies,
1452326 1455193 We had raised the bar so high
1455287 1458780 that McClane seemed to be<br />a little passive and a little weak,
1458874 1461286 It seems ludicrous,<br />but the hero of the movie
1461377 1463914 spends the entire first act<br />trying to get help.
1464004 1467372 That is the antithesis of all<br />the movies that are Rambo-esque,
1467466 1470333 Rambo is the guy<br />who grabs the microphone and says...
1470427 1473135 "I'M COMING TO GET YOU,<br />I'M YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE."
1473222 1477682 We had created this impossible level<br />of behavior for heroes in movies,
1477768 1480645 and Bruce Willis' performance<br />was a welcome antidote to that.
1480729 1483312 He's like a realistic guy,
1483399 1485640 He was a throwback to the kind of parts
1485734 1489693 that would be played by Paul Newman<br />as the hero of the movie:
1489780 1493280 not a superhuman guy, but a real guy<br />who could be hurt, who was scared,
1493409 1496868 <i>In the spring of 1987,<br />Joel Silver and John McTiernan</i>
1496954 1500948 <i>attended a performance of the play</i><br />Les Liaisons Dangereuses,
1501041 1502998 <i>The play starred Alan Rickman</i>
1503085 1505167 <i>whose performance as Vicomte de Valmont</i>
1505254 1508337 <i>would earn him a Tony Award nomination.</i>
1508424 1512668 <i>Immediately, McTiernan and Silver knew<br />they had found Hans Gruber.</i>
1512761 1514877 RICKMAN: It was such a weird process,
1514972 1518055 I'd just finished doing a play<br />on Broadway,
1518142 1520975 and two weeks later I was in Los Angeles,
1521061 1524144 and two days after that,<br />I was offered the part,
1524231 1526689 And I sort of wasn't allowed to say no.
1526775 1531019 People said to me, "Alan,<br />you don't realize: This doesn't happen,"
1531113 1534526 And I suppose my innocence<br />was my greatest advantage,
1534616 1537904 All I know as an actor<br />is to try to tell the story,
1537995 1540872 So I immediately started talking<br />to everyone involved about story,
1540956 1545701 Actress Bonnie Bedelia:<br />This is Alan's first film,
1545794 1549583 but the man is a wonderful actor<br />with marvelous training..,
1549673 1552961 So the question<br />he most frequently asked was "Why?"
1553052 1556545 Alan made us all stop<br />and think about "why,"
1556638 1559756 It's very easy<br />to make these films by the numbers,
1559850 1561810 I think Alan kept the truth in the film.
1561894 1564511 De Souza:<br />If there is something in here...
1564605 1568223 That's a reflection<br />of the American mood at that time
1568317 1572060 it is that the Japanese have bought<br />this American company.
1572154 1576648 This was at the height of American<br />paranoia about foreign ownership,
1576742 1580360 and losing our landmarks like<br />Radio City Music Hall to the Japanese,
1580454 1583617 And it's very funny, because the group
1583707 1588201 with the greatest foreign ownership<br />of American property and enterprise
1588295 1592505 remains what it's been for centuries:<br />the Dutch.
1592591 1596425 But we don't sit around worrying<br />about those insidious, sneaky Dutch!
1596512 1599721 We don't worry<br />about the "chocolate peril,"
1599807 1602600 <i>The 33rd floor is a maze of<br />computers, cubicles and glass partitions.</i>
1602684 1604846 <i>It is lit with a cool, blue hue.</i>
1604937 1606980 <i>DeGovia's design gives each area<br />its own identity</i>
1607064 1608805 <i>which opens up our sense of space.</i>

1632881 1635050 <i>McTiernan not only shows<br />what a character sees,</i>
1635134 1636885 <i>but emphasizes the activity of seeing.</i>
1636969 1639721 <i>He uses point-of-view,<br />over-the-shoulder and close-up shots</i>
1639805 1641848 <i>as well as a moving camera<br />and the rack focus.</i>
1641932 1644809 <i>McTiernan shows his characters<br />actively noticing and thinking</i>
1644893 1647351 <i>which is more involving for the audience.</i>
1647437 1649147 Die Hard <i>is a unique "cop movie"</i>
1649231 1651816 <i>because these small touches make the cop<br />seem like an authentic detective</i>
1651900 1653561 <i>not just a good guy with a gun.</i>
1653652 1656815 <i>The boardroom on the 34th floor:<br />rich, reflective browns,</i>

1669751 1672709 <i>In 1988, McTiernan told</i> Variety...
1672796 1675504 <i>"I liked the idea of imagining<br />what would happen"</i>
1675591 1678379 <i>when one of those<br />Baader-Meinhoff types got tired</i>
1678468 1681426 <i>of fighting his and other people's<br />political battles,</i>
1681513 1684130 <i>"and decided to show them<br />what a real criminal is."</i>
1684224 1686932 <i>McTiernan had also said,<br />"Terrorists have skills</i>"
1687019 1689181 <i>far beyond [those of] regular criminals.</i>
1689271 1691729 <i>What could someone<br />with that kind of access</i>
1691815 1694682 <i>to tools, to weapons,<br />to disciplined organizations</i>
1694776 1698360 <i>"[do] if they decided to go for the money<br />instead of the headlines?"</i>
1698447 1701940 <i>The film's Gruber is as diabolical<br />as his literary counterpart,</i>
1702034 1704822 <i>but more debonair:<br />He is a fiend, but not a fanatic.</i>
1704912 1708871 RICKMAN: I don't know if you read the<br />same comic books as I did growing up...
1708957 1712871 But every German always said<br />"Achtung" and "Donnerblitzen",
1712961 1715373 and "Schnell, schnell!",
1715464 1718206 and that's all they ever said.
1718300 1720667 So I'm grateful<br />to have more words than that.
1720761 1724220 <i>McTiernan told</i> Variety,<br /><i>"Originally, he'd been more downscale</i>
1724306 1726718 <i>a bit more typically<br />an airline-hijacker type.</i>
1726808 1730142 <i>"We fashioned Hans differently<br />once we had Bruce Willis."</i>
1730354 1732641 Supervising Sound Editor Stephen Flick:
1732731 1735063 This is where Hans gives you<br />his fatal flaw.
1735150 1738233 His fatal flaw is that he views this<br />as a child's game
1738320 1741312 to be played with opponents.
1741406 1743022 He's too complex.
1743116 1745949 In his final scene where he quotes<br />"Yippy-kai-yay"
1746036 1748243 he's not addressing the business at hand.
1748330 1751038 He's playing a game,<br />as opposed to living the life.
1751124 1753286 DE SOUZA: If you want to get technical...
1753377 1756085 John McClane is really<br />the <i>antagonist</i> of the movie.
1756171 1758538 The protagonist of the movie<br />is Hans Gruber.
1758632 1761465 People mix up hero, villain,<br />protagonist, antagonist.
1761551 1763667 This is where most screenplays go wrong.
1763762 1765753 The hero isn't always the protagonist.
1765847 1767963 The villain isn't always the antagonist.
1768058 1770602 The protagonist is the person<br />who starts the ball rolling,
1770686 1773929 so the protagonist<br />of <i>Die Hard</i> is Hans Gruber
1774022 1775933 when he decides to rob this building.
1776024 1778311 You write a movie like this by asking...
1778402 1781190 "What does the protagonist want?
1781280 1783237 What does he have to do to get to it?
1783323 1785610 What does the antagonist do<br />to thwart him?"
1785701 1788453 This film works so well<br />because everybody working on it
1788537 1791620 knew the difference<br />between protagonist and hero,
1791707 1795496 and because we always go back to<br />the protagonist to see what he does
1795585 1798953 to offset the countermove<br />by the antagonist, who is the hero!
1799047 1802790 I know it's confusing, and maybe<br />that's why so many people fumble it.
1802884 1805717 And that's why a lot of action movies<br />just meander
1805804 1808762 from a car chase<br />to a scene of interrogating a witness.
1808849 1811807 Police, firemen, doctors<br />are all essentially trapped
1811893 1814385 into being the antagonist<br />of any kind of drama.
1814479 1817187 The fireman can't just say,<br />"Let's put out a fire!"
1817274 1819561 The fire has to start.
1819651 1822268 Once you realize<br />that the hero in these movies
1822362 1824569 is usually making the second chess move
1824656 1827899 you realize your obligation<br />to give serious credence
1827993 1829984 to the plans of the criminal.
1830996 1833237 <i>Hans wields<br />a Heckler & Koch P7M13 pistol.</i>
1833332 1835448 RICKMAN: When you play a part like Hans
1835542 1838079 you have to look at how much<br />is working for you,
1838170 1840787 and that you don't have to do.
1840881 1843007 It's a very important moment<br />when he says...
1843091 1846083 "I'm going to count to three.<br />There will not be a four."
1846178 1848179 It isn't done with muscle.<br />It's not yelled.
1848263 1850254 It's civilized. It's even polite.
1850349 1853849 That was an incredible discovery,<br />that this man is incredibly polite
1853935 1857105 except when he's really riled,<br />or when his intelligence is insulted.
1857189 1860066 When you have all that working for you,<br />you don't have to play it.
1860150 1861936 It's happening.
1862027 1864028 It means you can just<br />concentrate on the particulars:
1864112 1868606 a little thought passing<br />through his brain, or a small smile.
1868700 1870611 And they become powerful.
1870702 1873413 <i>Composer Michael Kamen on how<br />Takagi's murder fell prey to the editors:</i>
1873497 1876374 KAMEN: You have to remember<br />Joel Silver's sense of humor
1876458 1879917 his sardonic wit<br />and his penchant for violence.
1890806 1893558 <i>According to Kamen,<br />Takagi's death was originally longer,</i>
1893642 1896350 <i>and the censors were appalled.</i>
1896436 1899645 KAMEN: The sequence was cut down,
1899731 1903065 but what they wound up with<br />was even more horrendous!
1943692 1946275 <i>McClane carries a Baretta 92</i>
1946361 1949322 <i>a sidearm that has been adopted<br />by many urban police departments,</i>
1949406 1952694 <i>and which replaced<br />the .45 automatic in the US Army.</i>
1961918 1964670 DE SOUZA: Almost all of the terrorists<br />look like fashion models
1964754 1966495 in contrast to Bruce.
1966590 1969467 Bruce is all-American. He spends<br />most of the movie in a wife-beater.
1969551 1971469 Even when he dresses up,<br />it's a suit from JCPenney.
1971553 1973304 The visual, social<br />and geopolitical contrasts
1973388 1975379 between this American Everyman,
1975474 1977715 and these snotty foreigners<br />was deliberate.
1977809 1979800 So one of the first big changes was...
1979895 1981771 "Hey, what if they're not<br />really terrorists?"
1981855 1986190 I made the legitimate demands of the<br />terrorists in the book into a cover story.
1986276 1988403 This solved one of the big problems<br />of the screenplay
1988487 1990655 which was that so much time passes<br />and so little happens.
1990739 1993822 If they're <i>terrorists,</i><br />what are they doing with all this time?
1993909 1997245 In the book, there doesn't seem to be<br />a lot of stalls in the compressed time
1997329 1999539 because you're in the hero's head,<br />in his thoughts
1999623 2001290 thinking back to experiences he's had
2001374 2003000 a previous case that might help him now.
2003084 2004415 When you can't get
2004586 2006129 into the hero's thoughts,<br />you start to notice...
2006213 2007588 "Gee, why aren't they <i>doing</i> anything?"
2007672 2009663 But by giving them a false agenda
2009758 2012009 we realized that the political demand<br />is an excuse
2012093 2015096 to have the police get tied up<br />with the State Department and the FBI,
2015180 2016966 and that burns time
2017057 2019139 giving the terrorists time
2019226 2021853 to break into this complete fabrication<br />of my imagination:
2021937 2024144 a fiber-optically controlled safe<br />that what?
2024231 2026190 Has a wire running<br />under the ocean to Tokyo!
2026274 2028526 <i>Of all the set pieces, the vault<br />is the most elegantly imposing</i>
2028610 2030862 <i>because it is the only<br />truly curved surface in the movie.</i>
2030946 2033688 <i>Almost everything else<br />has corners and triangles.</i>
2033782 2037366 <i>The vault room is Production Designer<br />Jackson DeGovia's favorite set.</i>
2037452 2039912 DEGOVIA: Everything in the film revolves<br />around what happens here,
2039996 2042707 and the way [the set] came together<br />was film collaboration at its best.
2042791 2044748 Special Effects Coordinator AI DiSarro:
2044834 2048577 Physical effects and mechanical effects<br />have always been done on the fly.
2048797 2050631 Here's a great one about improvising.
2050715 2053092 The building was brand-new,<br />with high-tech sprinkler heads,
2053176 2055678 but McTiernan wanted the<br />old-fashioned kind with the lead insert.
2055762 2057722 <i>At 2:30 in the morning,<br />DiSarro duped Security,</i>
2057806 2059806 <i>and raided the Fox Plumbing Department</i>
2059891 2061893 <i>to find the sprinkler head<br />McTiernan wanted.</i>
2061977 2063895 DISARRO: The floor was six inches deep<br />in fittings that I pulled out of boxes.
2063979 2065765 But I found the one.
2065855 2067773 I brought it to the set, plumbed it up,<br />got water to it, and made it work!
2067857 2070349 <i>With a single cut,<br />McTiernan intensifies the pace.</i>
2070443 2072775 <i>In the space of an edit</i>
2072862 2076150 <i>the terrorists are ready<br />to counter McClane's countermove.</i>
2101558 2104300 DE SOUZA: McTiernan walked<br />the building with me
2104394 2108137 once we realized we'd be using<br />this actual building that Fox owns.
2108231 2111849 And only in the world of Hollywood<br />could Fox charge itself rent!
2111943 2114526 You wonder how they keep books<br />in Hollywood,
2114613 2117605 and this was really an amazing lesson.
2117699 2120111 Fox made this picture<br />in its own building,
2120201 2123319 and charged us as if we were<br />a firm of orthodontists
2123413 2126371 who wanted to rent three finished floors.
2126541 2128248 We paid the going rate!
2128335 2131123 The building was under construction<br />at the time...
2131212 2134750 And there were several unfinished floors<br />that play themselves.
2134841 2138800 <i>The 32nd floor is dominated by<br />a color scheme of white and steel gray.</i>
2138887 2142130 DEGOVIA: We erected those metal studs
2142223 2145466 to make what was already there<br />more dramatic.
2145560 2149349 Stunt Coordinator Charlie Picerni:<br />John wanted a very visual fight.
2149439 2151680 So we put all those metal things up,
2151775 2155814 and when Bruce got on that guy's back<br />and spun them around...
2155904 2158906 I put them in a position<br />where all that stuff was going to fly.
2158990 2162824 When the blond guy gets Bruce<br />against the wall, that was plaster,
2162911 2166449 and I had the stunt guy take his head<br />right through that wall.
2166539 2170498 To be a good stunt coordinator,<br />you have to know what the camera sees.
2170585 2173668 A lot of guys don't see it that way,
2173755 2176668 but the camera is<br />one of the most important things,
2176758 2179250 for a stuntman<br />or stunt coordinator to know.
2179344 2182177 That's what makes you<br />a <i>motion picture</i> stuntman
2182263 2185551 as opposed to a circus stuntman,<br />or an Evel Knievel-type stuntman.
2185642 2188430 There's a difference.
2188520 2191854 As a kid, I worked with the older,<br />rough-and-tumble guys
2191940 2194227 who just came in, did a friggin' stunt
2194317 2196527 went through a wall,<br />and had a beer afterwards.
2196611 2201856 And then they started using cardboard<br />boxes and mattresses for high falls,
2201950 2204191 and it was <i>still</i> pretty safe.
2204285 2207277 Then we came up with the air bag<br />for doing high falls.
2207372 2210364 Then decelerators and Descenders.
2210458 2212950 So I went through<br />a whole period of changes.
2213044 2215911 But let's not get carried away<br />by the word "stunt."
2216005 2218417 A lot of people think being a "stuntman"
2218508 2220795 is the most dangerous thing in the world:
2220885 2223929 that every day a stuntman goes out<br />to work, his life is in jeopardy.
2224013 2225879 That's bullshit.
2225974 2229387 75% of a stuntman's work<br />is just knowing the camera...
2229477 2233095 knowing how to take a bullet hit<br />or do a little fight.
2233189 2236727 75% is made in overtime and<br />in hanging around; 25% is stunts.
2236818 2239901 For guys who do specialized stunts,<br />maybe it's more than 25%.
2239988 2242070 There are stunts in that 25% category
2242157 2245242 where you turn a car over,<br />do a big high fall, do a fire burn...
2245326 2247943 Those are over and above<br />motion picture stunts.
2248037 2252907 But you have to know the camera<br />to be a good motion picture stuntman.
2253001 2256084 As a stunt coordinator,<br />and as the director I am now
2256171 2259298 you have to know how to make<br />that illusion, and to make it safe,
2259382 2261919 so you can do it<br />as many times as you want.
2262010 2265173 There are times where you have<br />a tough stunt
2265263 2267425 that you want to do once and once only.
2267515 2270428 But they're not all like that.
2270518 2273852 For the most part, most stunts<br />should be able to be done
2273938 2276145 one, two, three, four, or five times.
2276232 2280100 You must be as physical as you can,<br />but have control.
2331246 2335114 <i>In the book, the hero is barefoot<br />not because the shoes don't fit,</i>
2335208 2338667 <i>but because he can't stomach the idea<br />of wearing a dead man's shoes.</i>
2338753 2341172 ALAN RICKMAN: John was very good<br />at allowing you to have ideas.
2341256 2343588 Like when I was talking to the hostages
2343675 2346042 there was a buffet table there.
2346135 2349221 I said, "I think I should just sit down<br />and eat a chicken sandwich."
2349305 2351797 It's <i>there.</i> I'm <i>hungry."</i>
2351891 2355805 Yes, Hans is about to kill people,<br />but he doesn't think about that.
2355895 2357761 That requires no thought.
2357856 2360644 What requires thought is...
2360733 2363270 "Will I have the chicken or the shrimp?"
2363361 2366774 John laughed and said, "Sure."
2366865 2369948 That's the actor's job:
2370034 2373277 Every moment should be filled<br />with something that is true.
2398438 2402227 DE SOUZA: This was an ad lib<br />by Joel Silver.
2402317 2405059 Film Editor John F. Link:<br />We worked seven days a week.
2405153 2407905 John would come in every Saturday<br />and Sunday, run footage with us,
2407989 2410401 and say, "Yes. No. This is great."
2410491 2413449 <i>According to Link,<br />McTiernan was not satisfied</i>
2413536 2415948 <i>with this sequence as originally cut.</i>
2416039 2418747 <i>They spent six hours together<br />re-cutting it.</i>
2418833 2421996 LINK: I'll never forget this.
2422086 2425422 After six hours, John put his head down<br />on the KEM [flatbed editing machine]...
2425506 2427497 and said, "It doesn't work."
2427592 2429844 I said, "Of course it doesn't.<br />It's not what you shot!"
2429928 2433421 He was trying to manipulate dialogue,
2433514 2437178 but if you don't have the footage,<br />you can't manipulate a scene like that.
2437268 2439430 What's in the movie is what works.
2439520 2442558 My biggest mistake was...
2442649 2445767 I cut the film but had not made<br />a duplicate negative of it.
2445860 2448654 So now I'm sitting there<br />with all this film all over me, saying...
2448738 2452527 "How the hell am I going<br />to put it back together again?"
2495243 2498361 DISARRO: We rigged a safety platform<br />and a deck on top,
2498454 2500536 and a way for Bruce to maneuver,
2500623 2504161 and a camera crew<br />on an opposing elevator.
2504252 2506670 These are high-speed elevators<br />between the 1st and 32nd floors.
2506754 2508791 This was not a set.
2508881 2511050 <i>McTiernan told</i> Variety<br /><i>that he didn't worry</i>
2511134 2514252 <i>about Willis or Rickman doing<br />some of their own stunts</i>
2514345 2517087 <i>because excellent precautions<br />had been taken.</i>
2517181 2519468 <i>"McTiernan said, " Most of my nightmares</i>
2519559 2521894 <i>were not to do with anyone<br />getting hurt in a stunt.</i>
2521978 2524688 <i>I was more concerned<br />that a stupid accident might happen</i>
2524772 2527389 <i>"that a crew member<br />might fall off the building."</i>
2527483 2531192 Supervising Sound Editor Stephen Flick:<br />The sound had a point of view
2531279 2533941 which was, as Joel called it,<br />"exaggerated realism."
2534032 2537320 I thought Alan Murray's sound<br />in <i>Lethal Weapon</i> was magnificent.
2537410 2540573 It was dangerous and interesting<br />without being overly baroque.
2540663 2542745 That's the way I want my movies to sound.
2542832 2545620 We were working on a new genre
2545710 2547792 this American realism in the cop drama,
2547879 2550667 and I wanted to work there too
2550757 2553545 because <i>Die Hard</i> wasn't a surreal piece.
2555303 2557886 GODUNOV: I'm still learning<br />how to act honestly.
2557972 2560224 Some of the process of acting<br />is the same as in ballet:
2560308 2562393 "ho is this guy?<br />Whom does he love or hate?"
2562477 2566105 But the physicality you apply to ballet<br />is toned down drastically for film
2566189 2569056 where a turn of your eye<br />will make the scene.
2569150 2571735 I can't always use my ballet training<br />for things that are physical.
2571819 2574405 For example, when I'm carrying a gun<br />and jumping through a window
2574489 2576740 it's not like I'm jumping<br />on the stage and carrying flowers...
2576824 2578656 Film is a bit more real.
2578743 2582202 FLICK: I touched practically<br />all the sound effects in the picture.
2582288 2585124 I developed this technique:<br />I'd cut an important sequence
2585208 2587543 then hand it off<br />to another editor, Richard Shorr.
2587627 2590337 He'd recut it, hand it back to me,<br />and I'd recut it again.
2590421 2593674 By passing it through a different set<br />of hands and a point of view...
2593758 2596468 Richard and I would work in tandem,<br />improving upon each other's work.
2596552 2598259 Nothing was sacrosanct.
2598346 2600305 Because, ultimately,<br />it's not the director's film...
2600389 2602307 It's not the composer's film,<br />it's not the producer's film.
2602391 2604098 It's itself.
2604310 2607730 And editing is the process of helping<br />the picture find and become itself.
2607814 2611182 Film Editor John F. Link:<br />And every picture finds its place.
2611275 2615075 FLICK: So my focus was entirely on<br />realism... with the exception of the roof.
2615571 2618157 <i>While editing background sound<br />for the Nakatomi rooftop...</i>
2618241 2620659 <i>Flick wanted to use the sounds<br />of nighttime traffic,</i>
2620743 2623412 <i>but decided against using it<br />from that area of Los Angeles.</i>
2623496 2625664 FLICK: It just sounded<br />like a nasty traffic wash.
2625748 2627791 So we used a little bit<br />of New York traffic
2627875 2630075 that has more echo<br />and interesting character.
2662618 2665829 <i>Karl is armed with a Walther PPK,<br />(immortalized by James Bond films).</i>
2665913 2668245 <i>And a Steyr AUG assault rifle.</i>
2668332 2670709 <i>At the time, the Ste yr was<br />the newest of its kind,</i>
2670793 2672336 <i>and in use by the Australian Army.</i>
2672420 2675589 <i>The terrorists are armed with<br />H&P MP5 9-millimeter submachine guns.</i>
2675673 2678916 <i>The H&P MP5 has been adopted<br />by the FBI and the Secret Service.</i>
2700281 2703200 FLICK: We had recorded<br />a whole new gun library for <i>Robocop</i>
2703284 2706026 that we used in <i>Die Hard.</i>
2706120 2708703 It was really nice<br />that we'd gone out to Texas,
2708789 2712157 and recorded a Ste yr and other guns,<br />and used them consistently.
2712251 2714538 What marked our work for much of the '80s
2714629 2718372 was the fact that we did<br />as much original work as possible,
2718591 2720425 and relied on libraries<br />as little as possible,
2720509 2723217 so it was all fresh to the ears.
2723304 2725545 The advent of Dolby,
2725640 2728758 and the fact that we made a living<br />cutting sound effects
2728851 2731809 meant we would go out and record
2731896 2734763 entire libraries of sound<br />for each picture.
2734857 2737474 That takes a lot more time
2737568 2740185 than cutting sounds<br />out of preexisting libraries.
2740279 2742896 But you've got to remember
2742990 2746403 that most of the libraries in town<br />had been around since the '50s.
2746494 2748906 They had been recorded<br />with older technology,
2748996 2750828 and were more or less minimalistic.
2750915 2753782 <i>To create the special effects<br />the gunplay called for,</i>
2753876 2756117 <i>and to ground them<br />in a sense of reality...</i>
2756212 2759000 <i>Al DiSarro worked<br />with weapons specialist Mike Papac.</i>
2759090 2762754 <i>Papac had previously run the weapons<br />arsenal at Universal for seven years.</i>
2762843 2765426 <i>With a month left<br />before shooting was to start...</i>
2765513 2767764 <i>Papac arrived on the set<br />with an armor yin tow.</i>
2767848 2770886 <i>Around the same time,<br />stunt coordinator Charlie Picerni</i>
2770977 2773059 <i>brought a man named Bobby Bass on board.</i>
2773145 2775386 DISARRO: Bass was<br />a true-to-life commando...
2775481 2777893 One who trains people how to fight,
2777984 2781102 and teaches the technical aspects<br />of being a terrorist too.
2781195 2783983 <i>Bass and Picerni,<br />with Papac providing the weaponry</i>
2784073 2786189 <i>put the actors through a training course:</i>
2786284 2790027 DISARRO: How to move with that weapon,<br />how to crawl with that weapon
2790121 2792408 how to load that weapon,<br />how to be stealthy.
2792498 2795616 And I remember this very vividly<br />because it sounded like
2795710 2798418 there was a war going on<br />on that stage every day!
2798504 2801462 Mike Papac designed loads for those guns
2801549 2804291 that were regular shells<br />minus the bullet:
2804385 2806303 the lead piece that penetrates<br />the body and kills.
2806387 2808378 They were blanks.
2808472 2811089 But in the world of blanks
2811183 2814721 there are loads that are not so loud<br />and loads that are <i>deafening.</i>
2814812 2817099 You can probably figure out<br />which they used.
2817189 2820056 <i>DiSarro and Papac satisfied<br />Joel Silver's demand,</i>
2820151 2822736 <i>for "exaggerated realism"<br />even in the muzzle flashes.</i>
2822820 2826404 DISARRO: [Papac] and I machined<br />plugs with a particular size hole
2826490 2828481 which then fit into the gun barrels,
2828576 2830738 and restricted the airflow through them.
2830828 2833578 This made the muzzle flashes<br />even bigger, more dramatic.
2835624 2838912 <i>The terrorists completely<br />capture this frame</i>
2839003 2841745 <i>horizontally and vertically.</i>
2849263 2851431 <i>A three-point camera move<br />that imparts information</i>
2851515 2853183 <i>(the use of the gun to jam the fan)</i>
2853267 2855227 <i>And creates drama directly,<br />(McClane's exertion).</i>
2855311 2857598 <i>And indirectly<br />(the stress on the machine).</i>
2857688 2859898 <i>As McClane journeys<br />through the building's core</i>
2859982 2861692 <i>the framing devices become more menacing,</i>
2861776 2863193 <i>and the action becomes more desperate.</i>
2863277 2865529 PICERNI: <i>Die Hard</i> was<br />the first big feature I coordinated.
2865613 2868355 I remember the first meeting<br />I had with John McTiernan.
2868449 2871692 Instead of just talking about action,<br />I talked about characters.
2871786 2874037 When you coordinate a show,<br />you have to get into the story.
2874121 2876581 You can't just do a stunt<br />for the sake of doing a stunt.
2876665 2879501 You have to get into each character<br />and what they would do.
2879585 2881542 KAMEN: The bendy guitar note
2881629 2884371 when Willis sees<br />the nude picture of the girl...
2884465 2887799 That was fun.
2888260 2891343 DEGOVIA: When I first read the script,<br />I saw a jungle maze.
2891430 2894297 It reminded me of the book<br /><i>High-rise</i> by J.G. Ballard
2894392 2897384 in which a modern building<br />becomes a tribal battleground.
2897478 2900220 In <i>Die Hard,</i> it is a space<br />of staircases and jungles.
2900314 2903978 There are entire sequences where<br />McClane moves through the building
2904068 2906153 not touching the floor,<br />like a predator in a jungle.
2906237 2909525 The building has a surprising<br />three-dimensionality.
2909615 2912573 You generally don't think<br />of vertical space in offices,
2912660 2916244 but in <i>Die Hard,</i> you conceive<br />the building as not just the floors,
2916330 2918412 but the walls and ceilings as well.
2918499 2922743 <i>DeGovia cites another influence:<br />the 1966 film</i> The Naked Prey
2922837 2925329 <i>starring, produced<br />and directed by Cornel Wilde.</i>
2925423 2929087 <i>In it, Wilde is pursued<br />through the jungle by African natives.</i>

2946485 2949443 where that kind of action<br />could take place.
2949530 2952657 When the building is a jungle,<br />people revert to utter realism
2952741 2954778 which is savagery.
2954869 2958157 DE SOUZA: One of the reasons<br />the picture had this urgency
2958247 2961333 was that you really felt that<br />the combatants were making it up.
2961417 2964785 You really felt the combatants<br />were inventing everything
2964879 2968122 as they encountered each<br />new environment or each new level:
2968215 2971458 their weaponry, their field of combat,<br />their strategy.
2971552 2973553 Some people say the movie is successful
2973637 2978052 because there are multiple levels,<br />and you have to gather different things.
2978142 2981635 It's the <i>"Die Hard</i> as video game" theory.
3033614 3037448 DE SOUZA: You'll notice how hard I work
3037535 3040823 to get people to lose<br />their guns in all my pictures.
3040913 3044201 Because anybody can shoot a gun.
3044291 3046999 We've all seen the movie
3047086 3049999 where the hitherto helpless heroine<br />picks up a gun.
3050089 3052672 Think about <i>High Noon.</i>
3052758 3055375 If Grace Kelly can pick up a gun
3055469 3058555 maybe the hero of the action movie<br />should work a little harder.
3058639 3062883 So you always want to have the hero<br />outnumbered and disarmed.
3062977 3066595 Lawrence Gordon:<br />We all felt Bruce <i>was</i> John McClane.
3066689 3070227 He's one of the few actors who has<br />the physicality and the humor
3070317 3073059 who can carry a gun and tell a joke.
3073153 3076612 Actor Bruce Willis:<br />When your life is on the line
3076699 3080442 you could die at any moment,<br />a very strange sense of humor comes out.
3080536 3083198 The research I did
3083289 3087248 talking to the various officers<br />and detectives who helped us on this
3087334 3089666 helped me find that black humor.
3090421 3092714 <i>Film critic David Edelstein<br />of the</i> Village Voice noted...
3092798 3094799 <i>"The action is shot from below,<br />at a slight tilt</i>
3094883 3097921 <i>as if the cameraman<br />didn't have room to stand up."</i>
3098012 3101556 FLICK: Later on, the pictures Joel and<br />others made were just about the tools.
3101640 3103475 "I got this gun and it cocks this way,
3103559 3105810 and I can fire it<br />and make big holes in people."
3105894 3109105 All they are about is the fascination<br />with objects of destruction
3109189 3112275 just like American car fetishes,<br />because there's an absence of plot.
3112359 3114771 In <i>Die Hard</i> there was no absence of plot.
3114862 3116780 The story was good, solid,<br />well-told, well-acted.
3116864 3120325 You want to support a picture like that<br />with exciting action sequences,
3120409 3122327 and crisp sound effects<br />that tell the story
3122411 3124493 without stepping in front of the actors.
3124580 3126665 The sound effects should never be<br />more important
3126749 3128786 than the actors or the action itself.
3128876 3130335 That's the key to most of my work:
3130419 3132831 never ever violate<br />the screen or the story.
3132921 3135340 We were working in an exaggerated<br />reality, but not a cartoon style.
3135424 3138257 <i>Die Hard</i> had meaning<br />and jeopardy and reality.
3138344 3140301 The sound had to be real and tactile.
3140387 3142138 So when you heard the sound effects
3142222 3145642 you also felt them and understood<br />what they were doing through your ears.
3145726 3148311 All the sound effects<br />were edited, cut and recorded
3148395 3151481 with characteristics so you could tell<br />the quality of the surfaces.
3151565 3154102 It wasn't bland.<br />It all had a point of view.
3154193 3156319 <i>Frank Urioste and John Link<br />sometimes cut abruptly</i>
3156403 3158895 <i>in the middle of a character's motion.</i>
3159073 3161825 <i>When cutting to or from McClane, they<br />add a sense of desperation to the scene.</i>
3161909 3164286 <i>They make McClane look more like<br />an animal in the jungle</i>
3164370 3165745 <i>than a well-trained police officer.</i>
3165829 3167661 <i>The motion is created on the set,</i>
3167748 3169666 <i>but the effect is created<br />in the editing room.</i>
3169750 3171835 <i>Originally there was a shot<br />just preceding this one</i>
3171919 3173830 <i>of dirt falling from the vent</i>
3173921 3175922 <i>to justify McClane's shirt's<br />abrupt change of color.</i>
3176006 3178508 <i>You can see the shot on disc 2<br />as part of</i> The Vault <i>supplement.</i>
3178592 3181970 Die Hard <i>is intense not only because<br />it takes place in one location,</i>
3182054 3184180 <i>but also because<br />it takes place in one night.</i>
3184264 3186551 <i>The filmmakers mark the passage of time</i>
3186642 3189561 <i>through the deterioration of McClane's<br />clothes... not to mention his body.</i>
3189645 3193138 Stunt Coordinator Charlie Picerni:<br />Through the years
3193232 3195567 some people have said<br />John doesn't communicate,
3195651 3197608 but with me he was fantastic.
3197695 3199529 John's a shooter. John's a moviemaker.
3199613 3201573 He knew how to set the pace of the movie.
3201657 3204024 He knew what he wanted,
3204118 3206369 and he communicated with me<br />exceptionally well.
3206453 3209039 Film Editor John F. Link:<br />McTiernan was very involved,
3209123 3211490 and very, very supportive.
3211583 3214544 And Joel was always supportive<br />of his directors and his crew.
3214628 3218212 <i>Frank [Urioste] was originally<br />the only editor hired for</i> Die Hard.
3218298 3220335 <i>As his co-editor John Link explains...</i>
3220426 3223384 LINK: Frank was getting<br />a tremendous amount of footage in,
3223470 3225552 but the sequences could not be cut.
3225639 3229678 Bruce was also doing <i>Moonlighting</i><br />and could only shoot at certain times.
3229768 3232385 So they had to shoot all of his material,
3232479 3237098 and then later on go back and shoot<br />the footage of the other actors.
3237192 3239986 So when I came on, Frank would start<br />cutting that stuff,
3240070 3242155 and I would cut<br />whatever they threw at me,
3242239 3245075 and we'd run everything together<br />and talk about everything.
3245159 3248244 Die Hard <i>was not the first time<br />Link and Urioste "collaborated."</i>
3248328 3251122 LINK: Frank and I worked together<br />as apprentices at NBC
3251206 3253368 if you can believe that.
3253459 3255746 We were schlepping kinescope recordings
3255836 3258004 back and forth from the lab<br />at CFI for processing
3258088 3260625 bring 'em back at 6:00 in the morning.
3260716 3263754 They'd go out on <i>The Today Show,<br />The Home Show,</i> whatever
3263844 3267132 before the coaxial cable came in.
3267222 3269891 <i>When writing the screenplay,<br />De Souza was told to rewrite</i>
3269975 3271932 <i>with an eye toward lowering the budget.</i>
3272019 3274187 De Souza:<br />The picture was wildly over budget.
3274271 3276106 And now it would be more over budget
3276190 3279484 because Bruce was going to get<br />this huge price for a rising actor
3279568 3281605 which was in the news.
3281695 3283905 The picture was going to be shot<br />mostly at night
3283989 3286606 forcing a lot of overtime
3286700 3289658 because Bruce had to do<br /><i>Moonlighting</i> in the daytime.
3289745 3291986 And because we got our star so late
3292080 3293957 there would be a rushed post-production.
3294041 3296783 Even if the picture was on budget<br />when we started
3296877 3298962 it was over budget<br />five minutes into the movie.
3299046 3300630 I had worked my way up the food chain
3300714 3302799 from television story editor to producer,
3302883 3306126 and I had been responsible for budgets<br />when I would do TV series.
3306220 3309087 So I had some inkling<br />of how to save a little money.
3309181 3311808 I would shave a little thing out,<br />eliminate some night scenes.
3311892 3314728 I probably brought that budget down<br />by $1,400, even $1,500!
3314812 3316980 Fortunately, I had<br />a background in television.
3317064 3319816 In Philadelphia, I had directed<br />community affairs shows
3319900 3322777 car dealership commercials and<br />early-morning evangelist shows
3322861 3325023 in addition to <i>Bowling for Dollars.</i>
3325113 3328651 There's a whole subculture<br />of local television
3328742 3330824 which is funny unto itself.
3330911 3334164 I hadn't been in Hollywood one week<br />when an agent called and said...
3334248 3337000 "You have a meeting this afternoon<br />at Universal Studios."
3337084 3339627 I went over there and they said,<br />"You start Monday."
3339711 3342172 But you must remember<br />that if you skip this amazing week...
3342256 3345874 I had four years where I was barely<br />making a living in Philadelphia.
3345968 3348505 The last year, I was on food stamps.
3348595 3351681 I believe that kind of struggle<br />and learning is what gave me
3351765 3354017 the confidence to be<br />not an overnight success,
3354101 3357264 but a six-day success.
3357354 3359647 <i>In his review,<br />film critic David Edelstein wrote...</i>
3359731 3362358 <i>"The sets are full of sleek,<br />sharp edges, blue-lit and lethal",</i>
3362442 3365776 <i>and the actions sequences aren't<br />expansive... the space contracts</i>
3365863 3368490 <i>with McClane firing from under tables<br />and through glass...</i>
3368574 3370784 <i>"And bringing [people]<br />crashing down into the frame."</i>
3370868 3372859 PICERNI: I'm not a Hollywood stuntman.
3372953 3375570 I'm from New York. I'm from the street.
3375664 3378124 A lot of what I know<br />and what I put in the business...
3378208 3380666 I learned from just <i>living</i><br />in New York City.
3380752 3382538 It's like an actor.
3382629 3384711 An actor is at his best
3384798 3387967 by observing everything in life<br />that he can put into his character
3388051 3390383 everything he can relate to.
3390470 3392472 When I do a stunt,<br />I relate back to what I did.
3392556 3394843 I'm not saying<br />I was a mobster or a maniac,
3394933 3396799 but I've been around.
3396894 3399135 When I did <i>Lethal Weapon</i> 2...
3399229 3402232 Mel Gibson finds his girlfriend<br />dead in the water, and he's outraged.
3402316 3404603 What does he do?
3404693 3407070 He puts the guy's head in a car door<br />and slams the door on him.
3407154 3409155 I choreographed that fight<br />violent, <i>violent.</i>
3409239 3412231 Because that's what it is: <i>crazy.</i>
3412326 3414488 I did that to a guy in New York one time.
3414578 3416910 That's the kind of stuff we did.
3416997 3419123 When you're growing up<br />in New York like that
3419207 3421323 you get involved in stuff.
3421418 3423250 And I use it.
3423337 3425588 DE SOUZA: If you're doing textbook<br />analysis, this is the end of Act I.
3425672 3427298 He's accomplished<br />what he wanted to do: He got help.
3427382 3430093 FLICK: There's only one point of view:<br />What is the story you're trying to tell?
3430177 3432887 The job of the sound editor is<br />to prepare the film for a sound mix.
3432971 3435098 The job of the mix is to create a seamless<br />dramatic experience where the hypnosis,
3435182 3437308 or whatever the experience is, is never<br />broken, where the audience is never
3437392 3440770 jarred out of it, unless you choose to create<br />a contrast where the audience is jarred.
3440854 3442981 So everything you do is to provide<br />the mix with the elements
3443065 3445191 that are necessary to tell that story,<br />and sometimes that's not <i>everything.</i>
3445275 3448111 In the early days, I used to go in and cut<br /><i>everything</i> because it was all there,
3448195 3450778 and I wanted to hear it all,<br />but it was too much.
3450864 3454075 In later years, I've been more spare and more<br />direct: less assault and more simplicity.
3454159 3456744 <i>48 HRS., Die Hard</i> and <i>Robocop</i> are<br />one peak of my maturity as a designer.
3456828 3460696 <i>The Nakatomi sign includes the names</i>
3460791 3465285 <i>of Set Designers E.C. Chen<br />and Roland Hill, Gaffer Ed Ayer...</i>
3465379 3470169 <i>Construction Foreman Steve Callas,<br />Bruce Gfeller and Al DiSarro.</i>
3475305 3478548 FLICK: <i>Die Hard</i> was cut<br />like a checkerboard:
3478642 3481642 There were lots of short scenes<br />and lots and lots of edits
3481728 3484641 as well as ideas.
3510257 3512339 <i>McTiernan cuts to a high overhead angle.</i>
3512426 3514677 <i>It's a sudden clue<br />that the stakes are changing</i>
3514761 3516804 <i>that Hans' expectations<br />are being upended.</i>
3516888 3518595 <i>Hitchcock did the same thing:</i>
3519391 3522852 <i>He would often cut to a high overhead<br />angle as his clue to the audience</i>
3522936 3525271 <i>that the story was about<br />to take a new direction.</i>
3525355 3528608 <i>This is the scene where</i> Die Hard's<br /><i>homage to Westerns crystallizes.</i>
3528692 3531736 ALAN RICKMAN: What I think has made it<br />a classic of its kind
3531820 3534864 is the fact that there's<br />a definite yin and yang between them.
3534948 3538532 It's an interesting device that<br />they mostly only talk over a radio.
3538618 3541245 I'd had a meeting with Bruce<br />and John McTiernan and Joel, I think,
3541329 3544697 and I said, "I think it would be good"
3544791 3547919 if they had a really healthy respect<br />for each other throughout the film,
3548003 3550461 and perhaps they could even<br />make each other laugh.
3550547 3554384 So you're constantly pulling the rug<br />out from under people's preconceptions
3554468 3557301 "about how one of these stories<br />might play."
3557387 3560220 Because then it gave me something to do.
3560307 3562719 Otherwise you're just making noises.
3562809 3565853 DE SOUZA: If there's me<br />in any of these superheroic pictures...
3565937 3568725 And I hope there's not too much...<br />It's here.
3568815 3571567 I identified strongly with Bruce.<br />We grew up 40 miles apart.
3571651 3574484 We grew up with the same haunts<br />and neighborhoods,
3574571 3576983 and restaurants in Philadelphia.
3577074 3579816 And we watched the same kiddie shows.
3579910 3582370 So him talking about Roy Rogers<br />and cowboy shows
3582454 3584747 that was just me<br />talking about my own childhood.
3584831 3587072 I was a fan of Roy Rogers.
3587167 3590080 And I thought it would be sweet in a way
3590170 3592411 because I was going for the contrast
3592506 3596374 between the snotty, Euro-trash villain<br />and this All-American kind of guy.
3596468 3599210 So he accuses him of being a cowboy
3599304 3601931 which was currently en vogue<br />among critics of Hollywood...
3602015 3604928 How these Rambo movies were<br />corrupting the American psyche.
3605018 3607395 And, of course,<br />it's going on now again politically.
3607479 3610481 So I gave that snotty<br />movie-critic dialogue to Alan Rickman
3610565 3612681 to insult Bruce Willis.
3612776 3614983 RICKMAN: It <i>is</i> cowboys and Indians
3615070 3618529 which means none of the characters<br />needs to be overly complex.
3618615 3620950 You're not going to go<br />into their murky depths,
3621034 3623776 but you do want to know about their wit
3623870 3626620 their strengths and weaknesses,<br />their vulnerable points.
3626706 3629289 So it's a crisper frame of reference.
3629376 3632211 The film needs to be kept<br />bright, alive and uncomplicated.
3632295 3635003 Its issues are always very clear.
3635090 3638003 So the director, writer<br />and cinematographer
3638093 3640300 can be as inventive as possible
3640387 3643345 without some actor<br />with his head in his navel saying...
3643431 3646048 "But this is really important."
3646143 3649352 You have to be faster than that<br />in a film like this.
3649563 3653602 In this scene, we meet<br />Gail Wallens, a TV news anchor.
3653692 3657310 DE SOUZA: There's a little joke<br />Joel and I had.
3657404 3660146 We used "Gail Wallens" again in <i>Ricochet.</i>
3660240 3664029 The other running gag<br />I've done with Larry and Joel
3664119 3668033 is our standard, stock,<br />third-world country: "Valverde."
3668123 3671115 It's in all the movies!
3671209 3673917 In <i>Die Hard</i> 2
3674004 3679374 there's a news report at the beginning<br />of the picture where they mention it.
3679467 3682960 The Noriega-type character
3683054 3687173 who was being brought to this country<br />for drug smuggling
3687267 3690430 had taken over Valverde<br />after General Aries...
3690520 3694684 Aries was Dan Hedaya's character in<br /><i>Commando.</i>
3694774 3698733 So there's a consistent<br />global policy in these movies!
3708496 3712660 <i>McTiernan creates a sense of urgency<br />by cutting in the middle of camera moves.</i>
3749621 3753080 MCTIERNAN: In a way, it's a buddy film.
3753166 3756454 The difficult part of it is that<br />in this particular buddy film
3756544 3759912 the buddies don't meet<br />until the final scene.
3784364 3788983 <i>Having contacted the police and disposed<br />of some terrorists along the way...</i>
3789077 3791579 <i>McClane leads the camera,<br />asserting some control over it.</i>
3791663 3793372 <i>The audience feels relief,<br />some confidence</i>
3793456 3796244 <i>until the music drops out<br />and McClane stops.</i>
3796334 3799452 <i>But the camera keeps moving.</i>
3799546 3802914 <i>It started out under McClane's control,</i>
3803008 3806626 <i>but now it stalks him<br />and closes down our sense of space.</i>
3806720 3810304 Special Effects Coordinator AI DiSarro:
3810390 3813132 The way McTiernan orchestrated the drama
3813226 3817345 of Bruce running through this building<br />with these terrorists was brilliant.
3817439 3819689 As Willis dealt with them<br />one after another
3819774 3822311 it became <i>physically</i> tiring<br />for the audience.
3822402 3826646 When he leans up against this wall,<br />lights a cigarette,
3826740 3830904 and takes that first puff
3830994 3835454 it seemed like 200 people<br />in the audience took their first breath.
3867989 3870697 Actor Paul Gleason:<br />I'm starting to make a career
3870784 3873276 out of playing nasty roles.
3873370 3876078 An actor can have<br />a lot more fun with these roles,
3876164 3878656 and when they don't involve<br />any real violence
3878750 3881208 you can bring a certain amount<br />of humor to them.
3881294 3884537 <i>Dwayne Robinson's driver is<br />stunt coordinator Charlie Picerni.</i>
3884631 3887214 DE SOUZA: In Act I,<br />McClane is trying to get help.
3887300 3890292 In Act II, the authorities are in charge
3890387 3893049 which is pretty much<br />the worst thing that can happen.
3893139 3895756 Die Hard <i>is often cited<br />for its claustrophobia,</i>
3895850 3899559 <i>but the interiors of the building<br />feel much deeper than the exteriors.</i>
3899646 3903059 <i>The exteriors are shot with an<br />extremely shallow depth of field</i>
3903149 3906358 <i>which means the division between<br />foreground and background</i>
3906444 3908230 <i>is very stark.</i>
3908321 3911404 <i>Usually, only one or two characters<br />are in focus</i>
3911491 3913701 <i>while the rest of the frame<br />is wildly out of focus.</i>
3913785 3917073 <i>The flashing police lights then add</i>
3917163 3919206 <i>just a little bit of mayhem to the image.</i>
3919290 3921250 <i>By comparison, the interiors<br />are more spacious.</i>
3921334 3924076 <i>They are also shot<br />with a shallow depth of field,</i>
3924170 3926878 <i>but not as shallow as the exteriors.</i>
3926965 3930208 <i>This gives McTiernan<br />the best of both worlds:</i>
3930301 3932511 <i>inside the building,<br />he can use shallow focus</i>
3932595 3934927 <i>while still giving us</i>
3935014 3938097 <i>a more continuous sense of space<br />than the one we have outside.</i>
3939102 3942355 DE SOUZA: There's a very, very deep,<br />deep film analysis publication
3942439 3946273 called <i>Jump Cut,</i> and they did this<br />geopolitical analysis of <i>Die Hard</i>
3946359 3949101 which just goes off on such tangents.
3949195 3952779 <i>The article, written by Maurice Yacowar,<br />was titled...</i>
3952866 3955904 "Die Hard:<br /><i>The White Man's Mythic invincibility."</i>
3955994 3958827 <i>Yacowar writes that</i> Die Hard <i>has</i> a
3958913 3961749 <i>"deeper appeal in its political<br />assumptions, which speak</i>
3961833 3965952 <i>to the sexist who craves to have<br />his obsolete delusions reaffirmed."</i>
3966045 3968161 <i>"McClane adopts the nom de guerre Roy</i>
3968256 3971794 <i>(as in 'Rogers' but also...<br />Vis-Ã -vis women... as in 'king')."</i>
3971885 3974220 <i>"Consistent with the film's<br />demeaning of woman [sic]...</i>
3974304 3976511 <i>are the passing bits<br />of gratuitous sexism."</i>
3976598 3979135 DE SOUZA: My son called me<br />from college recently.
3979225 3981967 He said, "Dad, let me read to you<br />from my textbook!"
3982061 3984393 It was a textbook<br />tearing me a new asshole
3984481 3987098 about the hidden<br />anti-feminist agenda in <i>Die Hard.</i>
3987192 3990150 So I've gone from writing movies<br />about heroes
3990236 3993319 to being the villain in the textbooks.
3993406 3996569 Actress Bonnie Bedelia:<br />She's the leader of the hostages
3996659 3999117 through most of the movie.
3999204 4002164 When you have fifty people,<br />and you're the one they're looking to
4002248 4005491 that might force you<br />to become a little stronger,
4005585 4008247 and a little bit less<br />a bundle of raw nerve tissue.
4008338 4011006 RICKMAN: One of things I liked<br />about the film was the fact
4011090 4015004 that Bonnie Bedelia's character<br />is an intelligent, strong woman.
4015094 4017301 And there aren't any<br />weak black characters.
4017388 4020005 All of them are brainy<br />and important to the story.
4020099 4022557 And back in 1988, that was pretty rare.
4022644 4026182 DE SOUZA: The media is something<br />I added to the movie
4026272 4029856 because this would not happen<br />in a vacuum.
4029943 4033356 This was just the beginning of the era
4033446 4037030 where helicopters would show<br />car chases on the street,
4037116 4040279 and the media would show up.
4040370 4044284 I said, "This scenario would become<br />an absolute media event."
4044374 4047742 And the media makes it seem more real.
4047835 4051044 It's also a great way<br />to lay in information
4051130 4053963 the audience needs to know.
4054050 4057634 Using the media can also add suspense,
4057720 4061839 and it can be a great way<br />to build tension, to misdirect people.
4061933 4063970 You can use media reports
4064143 4065561 that may or may not be correct.
4065645 4068888 I use it as much as possible.
4068982 4072395 If you look at how many<br />of my pictures I do that in
4072485 4076228 it's something that's part of my oeuvre.
4114902 4117735 Supervising Sound Editor Stephen Flick:
4117822 4122111 I had a difference of opinion with Joel<br />over the turning on of the spotlights.
4122201 4124659 I thought the sound should be chunkier.
4162909 4167369 <i>With his score, composer Michael Kamen<br />quotes "Singin' in the Rain."</i>
4167455 4171665 <i>He quotes it<br />throughout the SWAT team's assault,</i>
4171751 4175915 <i>and when the terrorists<br />destroy the armored car.</i>
4176005 4180169 KAMEN: I told McTiernan<br />that if he was going to use Beethoven
4180259 4184344 he also had to license<br />"Singin' in the Rain"
4184430 4188674 which was the other theme from<br /><i>A Clockwork Orange.</i>
4188768 4193057 I had great fun winding "Singin' in the<br />Rain" around the Beethoven.
4193147 4197607 Sometimes my sense of humor,<br />my sense of film
4197694 4201733 my sense of the absurd comes out.
4201823 4205817 In your work, you should be<br />like a child playing with trains.
4205910 4210620 I do take my business seriously,<br />but this is a business of entertaining.
4210707 4214496 You'd be mad to take it <i>too</i> seriously.
4214585 4218704 When I get up in front<br />of the orchestra, I try to have fun.
4218798 4222712 FLICK: I had hardly any collaboration<br />with John and the producers.
4222802 4227387 John's not very talkative.<br />His focus was music.
4227473 4230761 Michael wrote a dominant score.
4230852 4234561 By and large, there's hardly<br />any atmospheric sound in <i>Die Hard,</i>
4234647 4239312 or long sound envelopes<br />that would get in the way of any score.
4239402 4243111 Clarity of the sound story,<br />whether it's musical or not
4243197 4246406 is the most important thing.
4246492 4251032 I feel I have<br />some very complex sound sequences
4251122 4254456 that the composer needs to hear,
4254542 4258661 so he doesn't write something<br />that obliterates it, creates mud.
4258755 4263124 Most of the sound effects in <i>Die Hard</i>
4263217 4266630 are individual sound events<br />with short durations
4266721 4269759 as opposed to long sound events<br />with long durations
4269849 4273092 like a twister or a windstorm.
4273186 4276395 Because the picture required<br />these short-duration events
4276481 4280600 the sounds I cut were percussive.
4280693 4285108 So there wasn't really<br />any issue of conflicting
4285198 4288065 with soft, legato<br />or melodic elements of the score.
4288159 4292278 When you have a picture that has<br />constant but dramatic sounds
4292371 4294658 like surf or wind or a car chase,
4294749 4296956 or a rocket going off, like in<br /><i>Apollo 13...</i>
4297043 4299910 Dense, dense, dense sequences<br />of sound effects...
4300004 4305044 Then you have to spend a lot of time<br />interacting with the composer.
4305134 4308798 Because if they write<br />a score for a launch sequence
4308888 4313974 that has lots of cello, bass, tubas<br />and low-frequency instruments
4314060 4317724 you won't have what's known as<br />"power in the rocket."
4317814 4321523 Most composers are fairly astute<br />about that.
4321609 4325523 <i>Special Effects Coordinator<br />Al DiSarro's biggest challenge</i>
4325613 4329982 <i>was working inside Fox Plaza,<br />which was then a brand-new building.</i>
4330076 4334661 DISARRO: It wasn't occupied by many<br />tenants, but ones of high stature.
4334747 4340333 And for a building that had to look<br />like it was being destroyed in stages
4340419 4344663 we couldn't leave a mark on one piece<br />of imported marble from Spain.
4378249 4382584 <i>McTiernan told reporter Todd McCarthy<br />a state of "guerrilla war" existed</i>
4382670 4385879 <i>between Fox's film side<br />and real estate division.</i>
4385965 4389674 MCTIERNAN: They made us <i>fly</i><br />tons of marble in from Spain
4389760 4394004 to sit in a warehouse in case<br />we stained some of the marble stairs.
4394098 4397591 The movie executives consistently<br />came to our rescue.
4397685 4401724 Leonard Goldberg backed us up constantly.
4401814 4405728 It's just that you can't go<br />to Barry Diller
4405818 4408435 every time there's a chip on the steps.
4408529 4411738 PICERNI: I drove that tank.
4411824 4415074 I had a narrow slot to look through,<br />and I had to take the tank
4415161 4420076 down the street, across the island<br />and up the stairs.
4420166 4424000 DISARRO: The steps were imported<br />from Spain.
4424086 4427920 The handrails were made<br />from stainless steel.
4428007 4431420 We replaced the handrails with our own.
4431510 4435253 PICERNI: I had barely any room<br />on either side of the railing,
4435348 4438932 and I didn't want to give<br />the responsibility to a stunt guy,
4439018 4442010 so I said, "I'll do it myself."
4442104 4446439 DISARRO: For the terrorists,<br />we built a missile.
4446525 4450439 We put it on a solid-fuel rocket<br />engine and fired it down a piano wire.
4450529 4454898 The wire was treated with acid<br />so it wouldn't shine.
4454992 4458326 The wire ran three stories.
4458412 4462246 PICERNI: DiSarro was great.
4462333 4465542 Certain effects men are mechanical,<br />certain ones are explosive.
4465628 4469496 Like stuntmen. Some are good at<br />high falls, some are good with car work.
4469590 4473458 AI is good with mechanics <i>and</i> explosives.
4473552 4476965 He had a lot of guys on this show<br />who went out on their own,
4477056 4480640 and believe me,<br />those guys learned from AI.
4480726 4483184 AI taught <i>a lot</i> of guys.
4483270 4488140 <i>When the RV explodes,<br />what we see is a gasoline explosion.</i>
4488234 4490976 DISARRO: We rigged<br />an explosive beneath the tank.
4491070 4495439 We used black powder bombs to<br />detonate it. And we did it several times.
4495533 4498946 A tank's a tank.<br />It won't be too affected by a fireball.
4499036 4502245 DISARRO: Between <i>Predator</i><br />and 98 episodes of <i>The A-Team...</i>
4502331 4505699 I've had a tremendous amount<br />of experience
4505793 4510287 with gasoline explosions around stuntmen.
4510381 4514170 I'll never say I've had <i>enough</i><br />experience, but I was very comfortable.
4522143 4525636 <i>Here the action takes a subtle turn.</i>
4525730 4528563 <i>As De Souza has said,<br />McClane is a reactive character.</i>
4528649 4533359 <i>Mostly, he takes action when he's been<br />cornered, chased, or shot at.</i>
4533446 4536657 <i>Having brought in the police, he was<br />then happy to sit on the sidelines.</i>
4536741 4540154 <i>But now, with fellow officers in danger<br />and his anger mounting</i>
4540244 4543362 <i>he does not merely react but</i> attacks.
4543456 4546744 <i>For the upcoming third-floor explosion...</i>
4546834 4550045 DISARRO: John, Joel, Richard Edlund<br />and I had meetings about this.
4550129 4553298 Our original feelings were that<br />I was going to blow <i>all the windows.</i>
4553382 4556420 We did a lot of research
4556510 4559878 in the engineering department<br />of that building,
4559972 4564091 and found out that any real structural<br />damage that could have happened
4564185 4566597 would have been...
4566687 4569054 I don't think the word<br /><i>monumental</i> is big enough.
4569148 4572561 <i>Instead, McTiernan instructed DiSarro<br />to devise a way</i>
4572651 4575814 <i>to fill a full-focus,<br />wide shot of the third-floor windows</i>
4575905 4578943 <i>with a bright flash of light.</i>
4579033 4581616 <i>Once filmed, this would then be combined</i>
4581702 4584535 <i>with a shot of a miniature<br />Fox Plaza exploding</i>
4584622 4588081 <i>which Richard Edlund would produce.</i>
4588167 4591250 DISARRO: We contacted<br />the flashbulb division of Sylvania
4591337 4593453 the lightbulb company.
4593547 4597256 They made bulbs for us<br />that had a two-second burn to them
4597343 4600586 which is a long-lasting flash.
4600679 4604547 We built 4x4 pieces of plywood and<br />mounted all the housings for the bulbs,
4604642 4607054 and tied them to a firing system.
4607144 4610682 <i>DiSarro choreographed the flashes,</i>
4610773 4614607 <i>and also blew out individual windows<br />on the third floor,</i>
4614693 4618402 <i>for tighter shots that would be cut<br />together with the wider one.</i>
4618489 4622107 DISARRO: Then John asked me<br />to come up with a way
4622201 4625614 to cover the whole front<br />of that building with smoke.
4625704 4628947 We devised a trough system,<br />like a rain gutter
4629041 4632454 that we built to tie<br />into the base of the building.
4632545 4635663 We filled that gutter up
4635756 4639374 with a pyrotechnic composition<br />that we came up with,
4639468 4642961 and detonated it.
4643055 4647049 Die Hard <i>is often held</i> up
4647143 4650761 <i>as a prime example of Joel Silver's<br />oft-cited "whammy theory."</i>
4650855 4655019 DE SOUZA: I want to correct that<br />right now.
4655109 4657100 It's not "whammy." It's "Wham-O."
4657194 4661153 It's become "whammy"<br />thanks to Renny Harlin's Finnish accent.
4661240 4665108 John Gregory Dunne wrote a book about<br />the movie business called <i>Monster,</i>
4665202 4669992 and he went into great detail about<br />working on a movie with Harlin,
4670082 4672870 and the demand for "whammies."
4672960 4678171 But, unfortunately, Renny Harlin<br />pronounced "Wham-O's" as "whammies"
4678257 4682296 which I guess is the way<br />you pronounce it in Finland.
4682386 4686380 Joel Silver has disseminated<br />the Wham-O chart all over Hollywood.
4686473 4690011 It's even showing up in movies like<br /><i>Driving Miss Daisy.</i>
4690102 4693686 But Joel would admit<br />that it does predate him
4693772 4697515 that it was a term they used
4697610 4701478 at American International Pictures<br />in the '50s
4701572 4704030 where Larry Gordon worked as a young man.
4704116 4708201 So it's a very old Hollywood term<br />like "haircut"...
4708287 4712372 Which is Hollywood-ese for "rip-off."
4712458 4715871 It means give something a little haircut
4715961 4719374 a little trim no one will notice.
4719465 4723208 <i>Die Hard</i> has had many haircuts.
4723302 4726636 There's a misconception<br />that the Wham-O chart means
4726722 4730807 something has to blow up<br />every ten minutes.
4730893 4734261 It's an old idea<br />that once in every reel...
4734355 4738724 Movies used to be measured in reels<br />and they're still put out that way...
4738817 4742902 Something should happen that<br />makes the audience drop its popcorn.
4742988 4746697 Sometimes it's an explosion,
4746784 4750197 but sometimes it could be,<br />"Harold, he's not your child."
4750287 4754622 There are all kinds of things<br />that can stagger the audience.
4754833 4758292 DISARRO: The waterfall was designed<br />with Hogshair, or a rain matte.
4758379 4761246 It looks like grass,<br />only it's a very fine plastic.
4761340 4764458 The water runs over the rocks.
4764551 4767794 We painted the Hogshair onto the rocks,<br />to dampen the sound.
4787574 4792284 <i>Triangular camera motion<br />from Ellis to Karl to Karl's gun.</i>
4792371 4795113 <i>Harry Ellis is a holdover<br />from Thorp's novel.</i>
4795207 4799917 <i>He is the one character who calls<br />to mind one of Thorp's inspirations:</i>

4802548 4806301 Production designer Jackson DeGovia:<br />The disaster movie is about comeuppance,
4806385 4809218 but here, Nakatomi isn't the bad guy.
4868280 4871113 Die Hard <i>is a turf war.</i>
4871200 4874784 <i>As McClane loses control of this scene,<br />he loses control of the space.</i>
4874870 4877862 <i>The scene starts easily.<br />The space is well-lit.</i>

4994907 4998992 <i>The further Ellis' life slips away<br />from McClane's control</i>
4999077 5001204 <i>the more abstract<br />the unfinished floor becomes.</i>
5001288 5003495 <i>The camera pushes in on McClane's face,</i>

5104891 5108509 ALAN RICKMAN: My main job was just
5108604 5111813 to stay alive<br />to everything that was happening
5111898 5115266 because I'd never experienced it before,
5115360 5118648 and to try not to get unfocused.
5118739 5122448 Because it seemed terribly important
5122534 5126118 that what he had<br />was a sense of stillness.
5126204 5128946 And a sense of humor.
5129041 5131624 Both of those come<br />from a kind of confidence.
5131710 5133792 So it was about hanging on to that
5133879 5136166 while so much mayhem was going on around.
5136256 5139965 I've never heard that much noise<br />while you're trying to work.
5140052 5143966 As soon as anybody says "cut,"<br />a hundred people start running around.
5144056 5147674 You have to be your own monitor<br />of how to concentrate and when.
5147768 5151978 The problem you have on those movies<br />is getting the director's attention.
5152064 5155523 When you're the director,<br />you'll have one pause,
5155609 5158772 and 15 people are coming up to you<br />with 25 questions each,
5158862 5162071 and they're all important.
5162157 5167027 John was very good at making space<br />for that in the mornings
5167245 5168827 before we'd start shooting.
5168914 5172282 There was time to look at the scene,
5172376 5175664 and see what its possibilities were<br />and try them.
5305050 5308133 <i>As Al reaffirms their bond,<br />McClane rises, leading the camera.</i>
5308220 5311554 <i>A heroic low angle.</i>
5322943 5326356 <i>McClane is now asserting control<br />over his space.</i>
5326446 5329655 <i>The scene ends<br />on a note of confidence and calm.</i>
5329866 5334952 <i>In</i> The Films of the Eighties:<br />A Social History
5335038 5338326 <i>film scholar William J. Palmer discusses</i>
5338416 5341659 <i>the role of the media in</i> Die Hard:
5341753 5346338 <i>He writes, "The real comedy of the film</i>"
5346424 5350509 <i>lies in its send-up of the news media's<br />ineptitude in covering,</i>
5350595 5354008 <i>and complicit yin abetting<br />acts of terrorism</i>
5354099 5358309 [Die Hard] <i>focuses closely<br />(and comically, satirically).</i>
5358395 5362980 <i>Upon the fact that terrorism<br />and the media willingly sustain</i>
5363066 5366058 <i>"a necessary symbiotic relationship."</i>
5367279 5369987 DE SOUZA: The way I wrote it...
5370073 5373532 Dwayne Robinson was just a guy<br />who was in over his head.
5373618 5377038 In the performance, he drifts from<br />"in over his head" to "incompetent."
5377122 5381036 I thought it was a little too comical,<br />though it did get a laugh.
5381751 5385369 "Want a breath mint?"<br />was one of Joel Silver's ad libs.
5390510 5392553 The "Johnson/Johnson" gag<br />was Jeb Stuart's.
5392637 5395264 I built up the FBI characters<br />and made them more cold and chilly.
5395348 5397965 Robert Davi (the older Johnson)<br />is a terrific actor.
5398059 5400561 As Johnson, he's cold and efficient,<br />but without any malice...
5400645 5402852 Grand L. Bush, the younger Johnson
5402939 5404732 played his character warmer<br />and more charming.
5404816 5407066 He's become part<br />of the Joel Silver repertory.
5407777 5410613 <i>According to De Souza,<br />production began with a liability</i>
5410697 5413906 <i>which bothered him<br />but not the other filmmakers:</i>
5413992 5416780 <i>McClane and Hans did not meet<br />until the final showdown.</i>
5416870 5420363 DE SOUZA: I was telling them,<br />"Bruce <i>has got to meet</i> Alan Rickman.
5420457 5424041 They've got to meet and fall in hate.<br />There has to be a backstory."
5424127 5427461 They said, "If they met
5427547 5430710 one of them would kill the other,<br />and the movie would end."
5430800 5434293 One day on the set, Alan Rickman<br />was kidding around, doing voices.
5434387 5437550 He's a very gifted mimic.<br />Somebody said, "Do you do American?"
5437641 5441555 He said, "I don't do American,<br />but I do, like, California, you know,"
5441645 5445309 and then did several American<br />regional accents, a real tour de force.
5445398 5448891 I jumped up and said, "That's it!<br />That's it! You can meet Bruce!"
5448985 5452603 I don't think he had any idea<br />what I was talking about
5452697 5456315 since he'd been working with Bruce<br />for a couple of weeks.
5456409 5459743 I grabbed Joel, Larry and John<br />and brought them over.
5459829 5463914 I said, "Look, if he can do<br />an American accent, he can meet Bruce.
5464000 5466867 All he has to do is do this accent,
5466962 5470876 and Bruce doesn't know he's the guy<br />with the German accent on the radio."
5470966 5473958 Then John,<br />who likes to plan meticulously,
5474052 5477636 and does not like last-minute changes,<br />started to brood.
5477722 5481386 He said, "It'll never work<br />because he's seen Gruber kill Takagi.
5481476 5484810 We're shooting that tomorrow.
5484896 5489606 I'm not gonna inflict pink and yellow<br />and blue pages on the actors."
5489693 5492435 And I said, "Let me just try it."
5492529 5495942 So I went off to the nearest typewriter
5496032 5499821 which was a real pain in the ass
5499911 5503029 because I'd long since switched<br />to computers.
5503123 5505990 I spent an hour and a half<br />on this three-page scene,
5506084 5509452 and I took it to the set,
5509546 5512664 and showed it to John<br />and the producers, and they liked it.
5512757 5515749 They said, "What about tomorrow's work?"
5515844 5518336 I said, "Bruce is hiding. He's lurking.
5518430 5523675 There's got to be a way that Bruce<br />can see the guy's getting killed,
5523768 5527181 and not see the triggerman,<br />not see his face."
5527272 5531186 We walked over to the set where they<br />were going to film tomorrow's scene.
5531276 5535361 John said, "If we just move this table,<br />like, six feet, I'll put Bruce <i>here.</i>
5535447 5538985 It's perfect."
5539075 5543034 ALAN RICKMAN: The way I remember it...
5543121 5546455 I had a costume fitting<br />before we started shooting.
5546541 5549454 There was a long line<br />of terrorist gear for me to wear.
5549544 5553128 I said, "I'm going to be surrounded<br />by people 6'6" tall and wide,
5553214 5556707 and I'm going to look <i>stupid.</i>
5556801 5560214 And anyway, he never seems<br />to get his hands dirty,
5560305 5564173 so why would he wear terrorist gear?
5564267 5566679 And if he wore a suit
5566770 5569683 couldn't we then have a scene<br />where Bruce and I meet
5569773 5572856 "because he wouldn't know<br />whether I was a hostage or not?"
5572942 5576480 I went back home to England<br />for two weeks.
5576571 5580485 And when I came back, I walked onto<br />the set, and Joel said, "Read these."
5580575 5584068 He handed me these two pages.
5584162 5587245 It was the scene where Bruce and I meet.
5587332 5590791 So Joel had a think about it.
5590877 5594666 I was reminded of how high<br />the stakes were in that scene.
5594756 5597919 It was my very first shot of the movie.
5598009 5601377 Joel Silver came over to me<br />that day and said...
5601471 5605089 "So how's your American accent?"
5605183 5608767 I don't think he had heard it before.
5608853 5613063 I think if I hadn't been able<br />to produce an American accent...
5613149 5616483 I'd have gotten fired on the first day!
5616569 5619937 DE SOUZA: If you look under Bill Clay,<br />you see my name.
5620031 5624275 You see "Steve De Souza"<br />for a microsecond. It's my cameo.
5624369 5627407 <i>You also see De Bont, DeGovia,<br />DiSarro, Gfeller...</i>
5627497 5631081 <i>Larry Gordon and Charles Gordon,<br />among others.</i>
5631167 5636628 DE SOUZA: The one thing<br />that's left out of the story
5636714 5639592 is how the hell did Bruce figure out<br />that he was a bad guy?
5639676 5643294 Was he psychic or something?
5643388 5647473 As you put a movie together,<br />and as you start picking up the pace
5647559 5651473 you drop a couple of frames here,<br />a couple of frames there.
5651563 5656433 Originally, there was a shot where the<br />terrorists synchronize their watches
5656526 5660770 as they're getting off their truck.
5660864 5664573 And you saw they all had the same watch.
5664659 5667651 We established that in one down shot,
5667745 5672330 but as John cut the movie, he didn't<br />want to stop for that down shot.
5672417 5676456 DE SOUZA: After McClane gives Hans<br />the gun, the camera gets woozy, seasick.
5676546 5680790 That's John anticipating<br />the psychological state of the viewer.
5680884 5684172 <i>This sequence is presented<br />in a series of Dutch angles.</i>
5684262 5687846 <i>A Dutch angle is<br />when the camera is tilted</i>
5687932 5691266 <i>from the usual horizontal/vertical axes.</i>
5691352 5694936 DE SOUZA: It's a technique<br />that can get tiring very quickly.
5695023 5698482 But John always does it very judiciously
5698568 5702027 at moments when a character's<br />psychological equilibrium,
5702113 5705572 or the equilibrium of the situation<br />is in disorder
5705658 5709151 if I may sink to a little<br />film analysis myself.
5763800 5766838 Stunt coordinator Charlie Picerni:<br />My youngest son, Steven
5766928 5769761 went headfirst into a pane of glass.
5769847 5772589 It was a tough stunt.<br />He got 11 stitches under his eye.
5772684 5775769 <i>Joel Silver told DiSarro,<br />"Aldo, this whole room is about glass.</i>
5775853 5778595 <i>I want to see it all gone!<br />Flying in the air!"</i>
5778690 5781899 <i>DiSarro contacted a glass company,</i>
5781985 5786980 <i>and arranged for them<br />to stay open after hours</i>
5787073 5791158 <i>producing a special glass<br />for the</i> Die Hard <i>production.</i>
5791244 5794282 DISARRO: It was over-tempered,<br />baked a little longer,
5794372 5797615 so we would get a nicer-looking effect<br />for the camera.
5797709 5800622 We ran the gamut of glass for this movie.
5800712 5803295 Tempered glass
5803381 5806091 tempered glass that was baked<br />and tempered harder than usual
5806175 5810134 breakaway glass, single-strength glass,<br />safety glass.
5810221 5813432 We took glass and put clear laminate<br />over it. But mostly real stuff.
5813516 5816349 We probably went through<br />$125,000-$130,000 in glass.
5816436 5818848 <i>DiSarro ran different tests on the glass</i>
5818938 5822852 <i>to determine exactly how it would blow<br />and where it would fall.</i>
5822942 5824526 <i>These tests benefited<br />both the aesthetic of the film,</i>
5824610 5827693 <i>and the safety of the cast and crew.</i>
5827780 5830741 <i>He remembers the gunfire and<br />smashing glass as "pretty violent stuff."</i>
5830825 5833817 DISARRO: When you're there<br />even as a crew member
5833911 5836403 knowing every little bit
5836497 5840491 about what's about to take place<br />in the next 15 seconds
5840585 5843703 it can still be scary.
5843796 5848586 <i>Triangular camera move.</i>
5889133 5891885 FILM EDITOR JOHN F. LINK: As Joel said,<br />"The movie works like a Swiss watch."
5891969 5894763 There was no repositioning of scenes.<br />We couldn't move anything around.
5894847 5897433 And to think we only cut out<br />maybe two minutes from the rough cut...
5897517 5900009 That's something.
5946649 5950233 DISARRO: Here we used<br />a self-contained, battery-operated
5950319 5952606 blood-pumping apparatus.
5952697 5956315 It had a little plunger<br />that pushed the blood out.
5987899 5991108 FLICK: We had made a sound of glass<br />in McClane's feet,
5991194 5994357 for the moment where he digs it out.
5994447 5997533 The producer thought it was<br />so gruesome, we had to take it out.
5997617 6000869 <i>McClane's bare feet are not only<br />an excellent liability for the hero</i>
6000953 6004491 <i>they also make the primal aspects<br />of</i> Die Hard <i>more explicit.</i>
6004582 6007745 LINK: This was another sequence<br />Frank had cut beautifully,
6007835 6009872 and that John wanted to recut.
6009962 6013330 John wanted the performance different.
6013424 6016337 But he didn't shoot<br />the performance he wanted.
6016427 6019340 He had given in to Willis' desire<br />to do it his way.
6019430 6023515 So he was trying to manipulate it.<br />We tried, though.
6023601 6026186 Frank took one look at it,<br />Joel took one look at it,
6026270 6028762 and it went right back to what it was!
6028856 6031268 What was there originally<br />is what you see.
6055550 6058542 DE SOUZA: We only <i>wish</i><br />all the guys in the LAPD
6058636 6061549 were like Reginald VelJohnson's<br />character.
6123618 6125279 FLICK: If you have a picture
6125369 6127412 that has long sequences<br />with lots of sound effects
6127496 6129612 you can create a dramatic flow.
6129707 6131959 But if you have a picture with<br />lots of shorter cuts like <i>Die Hard</i>
6132043 6134250 your dramatic flow is the dialogue,
6134337 6136755 and the music that binds the picture<br />together dramatically.
6136839 6138549 So the picture is actually<br />glued together with music.
6138633 6140801 If you look at the film Walter Murch<br />edited, <i>The English Patient</i>
6140885 6142796 it's a legato film.
6142887 6144888 It has long sequences<br />that are driven by dialogue
6144972 6147140 with characters that work and interact<br />inside the scenes.
6147224 6149386 It's cut <i>classically.</i>
6149477 6151645 <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> is cut classically<br />with memorable musical moments.
6151729 6153939 But <i>Die Hard</i> is a classic<br /><i>modern</i> piece of editing.
6154023 6155816 It has a story structure<br />that's made by intercutting
6155900 6158235 a variety of scenes that are glued<br />together... dramatically... with music.
6158319 6160904 <i>Speed</i> has multiple scenes and locations<br />in close proximity, like in <i>Die Hard,</i>
6160988 6162990 but it's even more complex,<br />with an even more truncated style.
6163074 6165117 But if you analyze the picture editing<br />of <i>Speed</i> and <i>Die Hard</i>
6165201 6167369 it's the same kind of modern editing<br />and camera work by Jan De Bont.
6167453 6169615 <i>Die Hard</i> is like a checkerboard.
6169705 6172163 It's got very defined scenes of contrast
6172249 6174167 that develop to a point, to the endgame.
6174251 6175992 It's really a game.
6176087 6178380 <i>The irony of sound on film is that<br />it may be a pure aural experience,</i>
6178464 6180671 <i>but it is difficult to articulate.</i>
6180758 6183176 FLICK: Sound editors think<br />in terms of the <i>qualities</i> of sounds.
6183260 6185592 But you use words to describe sound
6185680 6187639 because directors and writers<br />have to think in terms of words.
6187723 6189805 <i>Flick's musical background...</i>
6189892 6191893 <i>He has played piano, guitar,<br />woodwinds, flute and saxophone...</i>
6191977 6194021 <i>Has led him to look at films,<br />and his work, musically.</i>
6194105 6196392 FLICK: Sound is mostly<br />a vocabulary of music.
6196482 6198358 Everything has rhythm, meter,<br />tonality and tone.
6198442 6200524 Then you start using your verbs:
6200736 6203398 It undulates, vibrates, ripples,<br />rides, quivers.
6203489 6205616 Photographers think<br />in terms of shape, color and light.
6205700 6207492 Well, in art, there's an entire <i>history</i>
6207576 6209536 of talking about shape<br />and color and light,
6209620 6211663 but since the craft of sound effects<br />is not very old
6211747 6214249 it's almost impossible for people<br />to have a language about it.
6214333 6216918 Music <i>may</i> be older than language,<br />but sound-effects editing
6217002 6218879 is really only as old<br />as radio, or recorded medium.
6218963 6220797 <i>Die Hard</i> is important because<br />it's part of a movement...
6220881 6222883 Ben Burtt and Walter Murch started<br />around <i>The Conversation</i>
6222967 6224718 to go out and record documentary sounds
6224802 6227552 that created a new reality<br />for sound in motion pictures.
6227638 6229514 <i>Once again, Michael Kamen's score<br />incorporates bells...</i>
6229598 6231558 <i>A gleeful flourish as the terrorists<br />enter the vault,</i>
6231642 6233599 <i>or, put another way, open their gifts.</i>
6233686 6236647 <i>Oddly, raiding the vault is one of the<br />most triumphant moments in the movie.</i>
6236731 6238768 <i>It's here that we realize</i>
6238858 6241360 <i>we've been partly rooting for Hans<br />and his men to pull off their heist.</i>
6241444 6243904 <i>The heist is a branch of the story<br />that has little to do with McClane.</i>
6243988 6246406 <i>If</i> Die Hard <i>is a chess game,<br />any progress Hans makes with the vault</i>
6246490 6248408 <i>does not depend on setting McClane back.</i>
6248492 6250824 <i>It's a clever trick of the story</i>
6250911 6253121 <i>that enables Hans<br />to succeed but not to</i> win,
6253205 6255040 <i>and that allows the audience to enjoy</i>
6255124 6257250 <i>both his victory here<br />and his downfall later.</i>
6257334 6259294 <i>Because while the audience<br />is rooting for both Hans and McClane</i>
6259378 6261585 <i>our empathy lies solely with McClane.</i>
6261672 6263757 <i>And after sharing<br />the terrorists' joy here</i>
6263841 6266218 <i>the scene in which we next see McClane<br />peaks our sympathy for him</i>
6266302 6268134 <i>bringing us fully back to his side.</i>
6268220 6270882 <i>The contrast is extreme.</i>
6270973 6275388 <i>According to De Souza,<br />at the time</i> Die Hard <i>was being made</i>
6275478 6280097 <i>he was conscious of the film's<br />Vietnam War subtext.</i>
6280191 6284435 DE SOUZA: In the movie<br />you have a guerrilla war
6284528 6289318 where a "plain Joe" foot soldier<br />is betrayed
6289408 6293447 by a chain of command<br />that considers him expendable.
6293537 6297622 It's there in the FBi's dialogue<br />about acceptable losses.
6297708 6302327 The FBI's attitude is a throwback<br />to the quote about Vietnam:
6302421 6306915 "We have to destroy the village<br />to save it."
6307009 6311424 And, like in Vietnam, no matter<br />how much equipment you have
6311514 6315382 a group of committed guerrilla fighters...
6315476 6319970 Who in this case<br />are <i>pretending</i> to be committed...
6320064 6324479 Can bring down the machine.
6325194 6328858 In these [action] pictures,<br />the war has come home.
6328948 6333317 But, unlike in a <i>Rambo</i> way,<br />where we're out in the jungle
6333410 6337153 here the war came home in an urban way.
6338207 6341074 <i>According to producer Lawrence Gordon...</i>
6341168 6344877 <i>Willis brought to the role<br />a certain humanity, a "reality base."</i>
6344964 6347831 <i>Gordon told the</i> Hollywood Reporter...
6347925 6350883 <i>"He seems to be a man<br />that you believe could lose."</i>
6350970 6354838 DE SOUZA: The greatest compliment<br />I could get
6354932 6357890 is the one I received<br />from many people, which is...
6357977 6362221 "I was at the edge of my seat, and I<br />really thought Bruce was gonna die."
6362314 6365978 To me, that was the greatest:
6366068 6369936 that I had been able to suspend
6370030 6372988 the unfortunately increasingly<br />entrenched belief
6373075 6376318 that the lead character is invulnerable.
6376412 6380280 And when I was writing my draft...
6380374 6383207 I <i>was</i> thinking<br />about pictures with Paul Newman
6383294 6387253 where he could win but lose.
6387339 6389831 Or Frank Sinatra in <i>Von Ryan's Express</i>
6389925 6393338 where he could get everybody out<br />but die himself.
6393429 6397388 Or <i>Bridge on the River Kwai.</i>
6397474 6400216 There are many, many examples<br />of great pictures.
6400311 6403645 <i>Detective Story,</i> a terrific picture<br />with Kirk Douglas
6403731 6407224 where he solves the case,<br />resolves with his wife and dies
6407318 6411107 was also on my mind a lot too
6411196 6415064 because it was a picture about a cop<br />who's estranged from his wife.
6415159 6418527 In that case, it wasn't<br />because his wife wanted to work,
6418621 6422034 but because she'd had an abortion,<br />and he'd just found out.
6422124 6425913 Shocking material for the '50s.
6426003 6429746 And at the end, there's a hostage<br />situation at the police station.
6429840 6433128 GORDON: Bruce has <i>become</i> John McClane.
6433218 6436882 We knew he would be good.<br />We didn't know he would be <i>that</i> good.
6436972 6440465 Bruce and John McTiernan<br />made us look very smart.
6440559 6444271 <i>During McClane's speech, McTiernan has<br />him pressed to the left of the frame</i>
6444355 6448098 <i>until he asks himself<br />an important question:</i>
6448192 6451435 <i>"What the fuck<br />were you doing upstairs, Hans?"</i>
6451528 6454316 <i>Now McTiernan has him on the right side.</i>
6454406 6457569 DE SOUZA: McTiernan is incredibly astute<br />in a psychological way.
6457660 6460277 Bruce is on the opposite side<br />of the frame
6460371 6463534 because the character's mind-set<br />has changed.
6465042 6469036 DE SOUZA: You start to wonder what goes<br />in the wake of these kinds of events.
6469129 6472632 In James Bond movies, whole city blocks<br />are destroyed, and no one notices.
6472716 6475677 But this takes place in the real world,<br />and media becomes part of the story.
6475761 6478298 It happens today.
6478389 6481889 It happened when Bush called that<br /><i>New York Times</i> reporter an "asshole."
6498867 6501325 Sound Editor Steven Flick:
6501412 6504205 If you're talking<br />about the atmospheres of the building
6504289 6506583 what you want to do is<br />create and define space
6506667 6509079 from scene-to-scene cuts,<br />and create contrast.
6509169 6512207 So when you make your foreign version
6512297 6515710 with all your American action<br />but not your language
6515926 6517594 you have a real sense<br />of where the characters are.
6517678 6519760 My films have a wonderful sense of place.
6519847 6522885 My focus was on realism,<br />but in the steamy areas here
6522975 6526525 the sounds had more character,<br />more cavernous and interactive qualities.
6558218 6561711 Stunt coordinator Charlie Picerni:
6561805 6565423 I always involve the actors<br />when I choreograph a fight
6565517 6569226 because an actor knows<br />that character so well.
6569313 6573898 Sometimes they're better than stuntmen<br />at doing their physical stuff
6573984 6576897 because they're into their character.
6576987 6580480 They get into it, and it looks <i>real.</i>
6580574 6584067 But you've got to control them.
6584161 6587449 Bruce is a good actor.<br />He can give you input.
6587539 6590998 And Alexander was a great guy<br />to work with.
6591085 6595875 He was very coordinated, he had good<br />kicks and he could use his feet well.
6595964 6599753 A good part of the fight was done<br />with both of them:
6599843 6603461 The closeness,<br />the headlock on the stairs.
6603555 6607344 You have to get into each character<br />and what they would do.
6607434 6611598 You put yourself in that situation,
6611688 6614055 and when you choreograph it,<br />it becomes real.
6614149 6618484 Bruce's character was a cop, a tough guy.
6618570 6622108 Maybe he could box a little,<br />street-fight a little.
6622199 6625567 He was more of a mauler. Anything goes.
6625661 6630906 In a John Wayne-Hollywood movie fight
6630999 6635368 you're gonna get a guy from the back,<br />turn him around and punch him.
6635462 6639456 I've never had a fight in my life<br />where I spun the guy around.
6639550 6643509 You're going to punch him in the back<br />of the head. Stomp on him.
6643595 6647384 That's realism.
6647474 6651308 In a real movie, that's what I do.
6651395 6654683 Joel and John didn't change<br />any of the choreography.
6654773 6659483 <i>Almost every action movie of the 1980s</i>
6659570 6663655 <i>features an action sequence<br />set inside an industrial landscape.</i>
6663740 6668109 <i>Enemies have squared off</i>
6668203 6671321 <i>in steel mills, refineries,<br />chemical plants, etc.</i>
6671415 6675409 <i>These industrial landscapes are usually</i>
6675502 6678790 <i>marked metal, water<br />and a restricted color palette.</i>
6678881 6683500 Production Designer Jackson DeGovia:<br />Designers like industrial settings.
6683594 6687178 They're massive, they're masculine<br />and they light well.
6687264 6690882 They have sources of light,<br />reflective surfaces, smoke,
6690976 6694560 and lots of places to hide lights.
6694646 6698685 <i>The "machine floor" under the roof<br />is</i> Die Hard's <i>industrial setting.</i>
6698775 6702268 <i>We see steam, large machines,<br />metal drums and pipes.</i>
6702487 6706105 <i>The space is largely gray,</i>
6706200 6710444 <i>but Jan De Bont punctuates it<br />with diffused reds in the distance,</i>
6710537 6714326 <i>and a yellowish glare<br />from the building's emergency lighting.</i>
6714416 6718250 <i>In a good action sequence</i>
6718337 6721625 <i>the characters move<br />in ways that are specialized</i>
6721715 6725549 <i>that reveal aspects of the character<br />to the audience.</i>
6725636 6729254 <i>Alexander Godunov was a ballet dancer,</i>
6729348 6733592 <i>so Karl moves with a grace<br />not often seen in action-movie heavies.</i>
6733685 6737269 <i>McClane is scrappier, more resourceful.</i>
6737356 6741975 <i>He uses the room's three-dimensionality<br />to his advantage.</i>
6742069 6745278 <i>If</i> Die Hard <i>is a turf war,<br />the winner should be the one</i>
6745364 6749323 <i>who uses the space<br />most effectively... and violently.</i>
6749409 6752618 <i>For much of the fight,<br />Karl only uses the horizontal plane.</i>
6752704 6755742 <i>McClane uses both<br />the horizontal and the vertical.</i>
6755832 6758918 <i>In</i> Die Hard, <i>the characters move<br />in ways that are uniquely their own...</i>
6759002 6762085 <i>And unique among action movies.</i>
6798333 6801792 DEGOVIA: In another action movie...
6801878 6804996 Karl would have fallen down the stairs,<br />something of a clichÃ©.
6805090 6808333 But here, he flies off<br />in another spatial direction.
6808427 6812170 <i>Like doorways, staircases<br />are dramatic compositional elements.</i>
6812264 6815177 <i>They suggest motion,<br />transition, activity.</i>
6820939 6825900 <i>Twelve cameras,<br />stationed on three different streets</i>
6825986 6828068 <i>captured the helicopter flyby.</i>
6828155 6831193 <i>The helicopters flew<br />50 feet above the street at 75 mph</i>
6831283 6833945 <i>before climbing up to the building.</i>
6834036 6836653 PICERNI: My nephews flew the helicopters.
6836747 6839785 I was in one of them.<br />We clipped that fountain.
6839875 6843118 Editor John F. Link:<br />The helicopter sequence was probably
6843211 6846329 the best-staged sequence of all time.
6846423 6849175 [Unit Production Manager/Associate<br />Producer] Beau Marks
6849259 6852297 choreographed everything.
6852387 6855800 And when I got the footage,<br />I hate to use this term,
6855891 6859555 but it was like cutting butter.
6859644 6862056 It was beautiful!
6882250 6884752 <i>According to De Souza,<br />when McClane starts shooting</i>
6884836 6886796 <i>to frighten the hostages<br />into going down the stairs</i>
6886880 6888996 <i>that's what we want.</i>
6889091 6891217 <i>We want them off the roof,<br />so we want him to shoot.</i>
6891301 6893759 <i>But then we realize that if he shoots</i>
6893845 6896462 <i>the FBI will mistake him for a terrorist</i>
6896556 6899048 <i>which is what we don't want.</i>
6899142 6902145 <i>The audience is conflicted,<br />and that conflict creates the tension.</i>
6902229 6904981 <i>This sequence builds to one of<br />the movie's most memorable stunts:</i>
6905065 6907306 <i>McClane's upcoming leap from the rooftop.</i>
6907401 6909777 PICERNI: John didn't know<br />about the technology of stunts.
6909861 6912694 He wanted to shoot<br />all this stuff blue screen.
6912781 6915068 I said, "We can do this."
6915158 6918241 I remember standing<br />on the roof of the Fox Plaza building,
6918328 6920194 and I was so enthusiastic.
6920288 6923076 I jumped up onto the edge and said...
6923166 6925084 "John, we could have him<br />jump off right here!"
6925168 6927580 And he said,<br />"No! No! Get down from there!"
6927671 6930465 DISARRO: Bruce Willis had an absolute<br />passion for doing his own stunts.
6930549 6933092 When he's blown off the roof,<br />you'll see that's Bruce Willis.
6933176 6936054 And you'll also see that the whole<br />frame is filled with raging fire.
6936138 6938846 Jack DeGovia, a very crafty man
6938932 6941924 rigged the roof of a parking structure<br />on the Fox lot
6942018 6944604 to look like the roof of<br />the Nakatomi Plaza, or the Fox Plaza.
6944688 6947648 <i>DiSarro and his crew walked along<br />the roof of the parking structure</i>
6947732 6949018 <i>laying mortars</i>
6949234 6951110 <i>loading them<br />and then adjusting their placement.</i>
6951194 6953613 <i>Then he stood on the edge of the roof,<br />looking over.</i>
6953697 6956741 DISARRO: I thought the jump through:<br />How long will he be in the air?
6956825 6958736 How long will his back be exposed?
6958827 6961371 Will he be too far below the roof<br />when the gasoline goes off?
6961455 6963947 <i>Before Willis leapt,<br />he, Picerni and DiSarro</i>
6964040 6967168 <i>went over exactly what they wanted<br />and exactly what Willis could expect.</i>
6967252 6969744 <i>Specifically, heat.</i>
6969838 6972340 <i>Willis' back was padded,<br />and his exposed skin was gelled</i>
6972424 6974425 <i>to absorb as much<br />of the explosion's heat as possible.</i>
6974509 6976761 DISARRO: On his leap,<br />I detonated the explosion.
6976845 6979803 He was going into an air bag<br />because it was a high fall.
6979890 6983101 And all the way down, I could hear him<br />yelling "Goddamn you, Aldoooooooo!"
6983185 6985144 <i>The wide shot was a stuntman<br />on a decelerator</i>
6985228 6987230 <i>a wire rig which allows the stuntman<br />himself to control his descent.</i>
6987314 6989482 <i>For the wider shot of the explosion, DiSarro<br />set off a colossal fireball on the actual roof</i>
6989566 6991609 DISARRO: We mixed diesel fuel and<br />high-octane jet fuel to get a different look.
6991693 6993945 <i>DiSarro set mortars on 1 1/8-inch-thick<br />plywood, closed all the roof's access doors,</i>
6994029 6995988 <i>and taped up any cracks<br />to absorb concussion.</i>
6996072 6998366 DISARRO: Concussion wants to rattle itself<br />through the floors and blow windows out.
6998450 7000284 It would have taken out<br />two or three floors, easy.
7000368 7003326 DISARRO: This was all done on a stage.
7003413 7005871 We had Bruce swinging on a pulley
7005957 7008324 that ran through the backing<br />on the stage wall.
7008418 7011376 After he hit the window
7011463 7014205 we took safety glass out,<br />put tempered glass in,
7014299 7016711 and boom, he's through.
7021515 7023677 When the spool starts pulling him out
7023767 7026475 that was me standing on the floor,<br />pulling Bruce.
7026561 7030555 He was fighting, but I weighed<br />a little more than him.
7030774 7033234 Plus, I had put a little silicone under<br />the pad he was on, so he was slipping.
7033318 7036060 Those are the cute things we do.
7050585 7052879 <i>DeGovia's jungle metaphor<br />for</i> Die Hard <i>becomes almost literal.</i>
7052963 7054922 <i>Stalking through</i> Fallingwater,<br /><i>McClane is in the jungle at last.</i>
7055006 7057873 <i>The explosion was actually<br />the FBI helicopter</i>
7057968 7060130 <i>crashing through the 30th floor.</i>
7060220 7063212 DISARRO: We took<br />an old helicopter fuselage
7063306 7066549 rigged it on a suspension cable<br />and swung it like a pendulum.
7066643 7070682 We had a hydraulic winch<br />pull it back to the stage wall
7070772 7074233 then used an aircraft cable cutter<br />to release the helicopter into the set.
7074317 7076775 We blew the window pyrotechnically.
7076861 7080354 <i>The building has been so badly abused</i>
7080448 7083486 <i>it's almost as if<br />it is now consuming itself</i>
7086121 7089489 Film Editor John F. Link:<br />With the action scenes...
7089583 7091574 I have tremendous fun
7091668 7094410 because I can double up<br />on every single cut.
7094504 7097917 I can take an explosion and cut it<br />three, four different times,
7098008 7101751 and make it... hopefully...<br />Extremely entertaining.
7101845 7105679 You can't do that with dialogue.<br />So the action is great fun.
7105765 7108518 DE SOUZA: With this brilliant<br />diabolical plan of Hans Gruber's
7108602 7111014 we literally started the movie
7111104 7113937 without knowing how the terrorists<br />were going to escape.
7114024 7116857 The obvious answer is a helicopter,
7116943 7120356 but they blew up the helicopters<br />they demanded.
7120447 7122905 Plus, if everything else<br />they said is a lie
7122991 7125653 why would their demand<br />for helicopters be true?
7125744 7128746 We were deep into the movie and still<br />didn't know what the escape plan was.
7128830 7130946 Finally, inspiration struck.
7131041 7135080 I don't know who it was,<br />but it's my story, so I'll say it was me.
7135170 7138256 I said, "There'll be all this chaos<br />when the building blows up.
7138340 7141799 What if they're escaping<br />in a rescue vehicle?"
7141885 7144929 What's great about it is that<br />the minute you see them do it
7145013 7147630 you realize it would work.
7147724 7150386 You get it right away, with no dialogue.
7150477 7153396 Jack DeGovia is right to say<br />that the only cheat in the movie
7153480 7156598 is that the ambulance fits<br />inside that truck.
7156691 7160150 But I'd done that before.<br />When I produced <i>Knight Rider.</i>
7160236 7163155 I had said, "We'll make the office<br />a truck, to keep the show on the road."
7163239 7166903 They said, "The set wouldn't fit<br />in the back of the truck."
7167077 7169284 I said, "On the sound stage it will."
7169371 7172164 So if you notice, when the car drives<br />up to the truck, it's pretty tight,
7172248 7175036 but inside there's plenty of elbowroom.
7193103 7196596 <i>This scene is where</i> Die Hard's <i>homage<br />to Westerns will be resolved.</i>
7196690 7199609 <i>It is straight out of</i> High Noon<br /><i>and dozens of others like it,</i>
7199693 7203277 <i>but with McTiernan's style and precision.</i>
7220171 7226042 <i>Another triangular camera move, as<br />Eddie steps closer to his machine gun.</i>
7228304 7232263 <i>McTiernan has many small ways<br />of defining spatial relationships,</i>
7232350 7235843 <i>and of milking them for suspense.</i>
7235937 7239305 <i>Many action movies,<br />from</i> Dirty Harry <i>to</i> Robocop
7239399 7241390 <i>take their cues from Westerns.</i>
7241484 7246479 <i>Thematically, the two genres<br />are almost identical.</i>
7246573 7249575 <i>A hero appears, brings some rogues<br />to justice, and saves the girl.</i>
7249659 7254119 <i>And often, the town or institution<br />he serves is not worthy of his services.</i>
7254205 7258950 <i>He is set apart from the community<br />by the very thing</i>
7259043 7263128 <i>that enables him<br />to save it... or avenge it:</i>
7263214 7266252 <i>his willingness to do<br />what no one else will.</i>
7266342 7270427 <i>Especially if it is violent.</i>
7270513 7274097 <i>From Westerns, action movies<br />of the '70s and '80s</i>
7274184 7275267 <i>inherited the tension</i>

7277562 7280054 <i>and the ideal of community.</i>
7280148 7285359 <i>In the early '70s, as the popularity<br />of Westerns dwindled</i>
7285445 7288107 <i>action movies became Westerns<br />by other means.</i>
7288198 7291566 <i>The showdown here is a recreation<br />of the showdown in</i> High Noon.
7291659 7295197 <i>What's more, McClane and Hans know it.</i>
7295288 7299577 Film Editor John F. Link:<br />It was <i>Gunfight at the OK Corral.</i>
7299667 7302876 That's the way John designed it.
7302962 7307923 John said, "This is a shoot-out.<br />This is a cowboy coming into town, man."
7308009 7311001 And with all the sparks,<br />you couldn't hear dialogue.
7311095 7314963 We took it all out.<br />Looped every frame of it.
7315058 7319268 <i>The irony comes from their playing out<br />this traditional Western scenario</i>
7319354 7322604 <i>in an ultramodern corporate setting...<br />And a Japanese one at that.</i>
7324692 7328902 <i>Picerni's older son, Chuck,<br />doubled for Rickman.</i>
7328988 7332731 <i>The shot was a</i> practical <i>shot...<br />Meaning it was real.</i>
7350885 7352845 PICERNI: We were dropping<br />Alan Rickman from a forklift
7352929 7354886 twenty-five feet above an air bag.
7354973 7356891 He was a little concerned,<br />but he did it. He had balls.
7356975 7359518 We had him on a quick-release harness.<br />I told him...
7359602 7362354 "I'm going to count 'three, two,<br />one, go, ' and then release you."
7362438 7364523 But I told my man that we were going<br />to release him on 'one.'
7364607 7366692 Alan was still anticipating the "Go!"<br />when we released him.
7366776 7368938 His face went <i>"Woaaaahhh!"</i>
7369028 7372566 And that's the take John used.<br />It was the most exciting.
7372657 7375069 <i>For the wider view of the fall...</i>
7375159 7378162 <i>Picerni brought in Kenny Bates<br />to drop 32 floors on a</i> Descender.
7378246 7381113 PICERNI: A Descender is like an elevator.
7381207 7384495 There's a cable on your back,
7384586 7387544 and an extension bar<br />hooked up to a paddle braking system.
7387630 7391248 You fall a certain number of feet<br />per second.
7391342 7394642 DISARRO: He fell 32 floors and stopped<br />right off the ground. <i>Scary.</i>
7497657 7500866 DE SOUZA: I sat in on a panel discussion<br />with Callie Khouri
7500952 7503660 the screenwriter of <i>Thelma and Louise.</i>
7503746 7506704 She said that this moment would have<br />been stronger
7506791 7510000 if Holly had spoken first<br />and McClane had spoken second.
7511045 7513839 DE SOUZA: I know John McTiernan<br />and his knowledge of film,
7513923 7517426 and I would bet money that is an homage<br />to Sam Fuller in <i>The Big Red One.</i>
7517510 7521096 In <i>The Big Red One,</i> there's a gunfight<br />between American and Nazi forces
7521180 7522973 that spills over into an insane asylum.
7523057 7525768 As the fight progresses,<br />there's one insane patient who
7525852 7529146 as bodies are falling all around him,<br />slowly starts coming back to his senses.
7529230 7531221 This unknown French actor looks
7531315 7535183 sees the American flag on the guys'<br />uniforms, sees the German uniforms
7535278 7538322 picks up a machine gun from a fallen guy<br />and starts shooting Germans!
7538406 7541867 And as he's doing it, he's shouting,<br />"I'm sane! I'm sane! Thank God I'm sane!"
7541951 7544495 To me, John did an homage to that,<br />without dialogue
7544579 7547539 with this wonderful expression<br />on Reginald VelJohnson's face
7547623 7549541 which says,<br />"Hey, I killed, so I'm cured!"
7549625 7551293 It's funny in an extremely dark way.
7551377 7553754 And it does have this connection<br />to the other film.
7553838 7556507 Actor Reginald VelJohnson:<br />[AI] has lost faith in the system,
7556591 7558884 and the system has made him<br />lose faith in himself.
7558968 7563132 McClane helps him get that faith back so<br />he can be the kind of man he wants to be.
7563222 7565641 ALAN RICKMAN: People get involved here,<br />and that's the thing.
7565725 7568894 If people are patronized, if a film is<br />geared towards a short attention span
7568978 7571640 then it has a short shelf life.
7572231 7574733 Films that involve the audience and<br />obey the "once upon a time" principle
7574817 7577479 have a chance of lasting.
7577570 7579571 It's hard to fault it.<br />Every beat is there. Every climax.
7579655 7582574 The rhythm has a crescendo, but all<br />the way along this rising crescendo
7582658 7584868 there are these little grace notes<br />all the way through.
7584952 7587410 It has great characters,
7587497 7590034 and great payoffs for all the characters
7590124 7592411 right down to Bonnie<br />punching the reporter.
7592502 7595129 She doesn't throw a girlie punch,<br />either. She doesn't slap him.
7595213 7597329 She <i>decks</i> him.
7598800 7601792 We're storytellers,<br />and we forget that at our peril.
7601886 7605254 Here, there was an openness<br />to the way the story developed.
7605348 7608181 Some serendipity invaded the film.
7624283 7627411 FILM EDITOR JOHN F. LINK: I think<br />the most important part of films
7627495 7630078 is the written word...
7630164 7633083 If the written word from<br />the screenwriter does a hell of a job
7633167 7636455 then you pass that off to a director
7636546 7639006 who can take the words off the page<br />and make it work,
7639090 7641133 and then give it to us guys<br />where we can edit.
7641217 7643800 But I think any film, it's the script.
7643886 7646469 If the script doesn't work,<br />it doesn't work.
7646556 7649433 There's a lot of shows that don't have<br />a fabric you really want.
7649517 7652811 And like I said before, <i>Die Hard</i> is,<br />as Joel Silver said, "a Swiss watch."
7652895 7656638 It works from the beginning to the end.<br />And it's a brilliant film.
7656732 7659315 AI DISARRO: One thing I've learned
7659402 7662269 in all my years<br />as a special effects coordinator
7662363 7665025 is that you have to have<br />the script, the story
7665116 7667528 great actors and a great director.
7667618 7670326 Not one entity<br />ever makes the movie great.
7670413 7673155 <i>Die Hard</i> wasn't a movie<br />about one big effect.
7673249 7676412 What made this movie special was
7676502 7679494 it had an abundance of<br />carefully thought-out effects
7679589 7682707 that tied in tremendously<br />to the acting and the story.
7682800 7686009 SOUND EDITOR STEPHEN FLICK: The key is
7686095 7689139 if you start with a great actor<br />who has wonderful comic potential
7689223 7691885 a fabulous director, a great score,
7691976 7693852 and some really, really smart producers
7693936 7696021 you're going to end up<br />with a successful movie...
7696105 7698517 The kind that everybody hopes to spawn.
7698608 7701475 And <i>Die Hard</i> became a model.
7701569 7704571 DE SOUZA: For a while, it seemed to be<br />so easy to imitate this model:
7704655 7707488 Bad guys take prisoners,<br />good guy stops them.
7707575 7710119 It seems like it writes itself,<br />and all you have to do
7710203 7713080 is have a different place<br />that isn't like the <i>Die Hard</i> building.
7713164 7715952 But there were just so many imitations,
7716042 7719086 and they got more and more feeble<br />and they made less and less sense.
7719170 7722333 The epitome of it<br />was this movie <i>Sudden Death.</i>
7722423 7725290 I must confess I haven't seen it.
7725384 7727719 But I know that it was<br />the epitome of the problem
7727803 7730545 because I had the dumb luck<br />of having a meeting
7730640 7732756 on the Monday morning after it opened.
7732850 7735763 I walked past an open door
7735853 7738561 as the film's producer<br />was getting the numbers,
7738648 7741231 and they weren't good.
7741317 7744236 And I remember him saying,<br />"But those <i>can't</i> be the right numbers.
7744320 7747278 We <i>had</i> to do better than that.
7747365 7750699 We had more hostages in this movie<br />than any other picture!
7750785 7753777 A whole arena full of hostages!"
7753871 7757034 That's when I realized<br />that people were going into this
7757124 7760367 with the wrong things in their minds.
7760461 7763249 I was offered a project
7763339 7766008 where, if I did the production rewrite,<br />I'd get to direct it.
7766092 7769084 This project was hiding its larceny<br />the least, I guess.
7769178 7771840 It was the most honest.
7771931 7774468 "I think you'll like it," they said.
7774558 7776845 "It's <i>Die Hard</i> in a building."
