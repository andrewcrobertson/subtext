5249535 5251537 I-I-I don't have the authority.
5251537 5253081 I can't authorize--<br />Two hours is not enough.
5253081 5254958 -(transmission cuts out)<br />-H-Hello?
5254958 5256125 Hello?
5257585 5258753 Danny, did you get all that?
5258753 5260797 Let's go. We gotta make some calls.
5260797 5263007 Do you think they'll even try to do it?
5263007 5264884 Who cares?
5267595 5269722 Theo, are we on schedule?
5269722 5271683 One more to go, then it's up to you.
5271683 5273518 And you better be right,<br />because it looks like
5273518 5275103 this last one's gonna take a miracle.
5275103 5278147 It's Christmas, Theo.<br />It's the time of miracles.
5278398 5281901 So be of good cheer and call me<br />when you hit the last lock.
5283403 5286572 Karl, hunt that little shit down
5286572 5287824 and get those detonators.
5288658 5290076 Fritz is checking the explosives.
5290076 5292787 I'll check the explosives.<br />You just get the detonators.
5293913 5295123 Hey, Powell, you out there?
5296582 5298501 I'm here, John. I'm here.
5299043 5301921 You gotta believe me.<br />There was nothing I could do.
5303589 5306092 Well, it's gonna be both our asses<br />if you're wrong.
5306092 5307677 I hear you.

5317478 5318980 <i>It doesn't make sense, man.</i>
5320148 5321190 Don't ask me, man.
5321190 5324027 I'm just a desk jockey who was<br />on my way home when you rang.
5324027 5327447 The way you drove that car,<br />I figured you for the street, Al.

5336789 5339834 Dr. Hasseldorf, what can we expect<br />in the next few hours?
5339834 5343087 Well, Gail, by this time the hostages<br />should be going through
5343087 5345757 the early stages<br />of the "Helsinki Syndrome."
5345757 5349177 -As in Helsinki, Sweden.<br />-HASSELDORF: Finland.
5349177 5353181 Basically, it's when the hostages<br />and the terrorists go through
5353181 5357852 a sort of psychological transference<br />and a projection of dependency.
5357852 5361022 <i>A strange sort of trust and bond develops.</i>
5361022 5363232 <i>We've had situations where the hostages</i>
5363483 5365860 <i>have embraced their captors</i><br /><i>after their release</i>
5365860 5368112 <i>and even corresponded</i><br /><i>with them in prison.</i>
5368112 5370740 No, no. No, darling. "Asian Dawn."
5370740 5374243 Dawn. D-A-W-N.
5374535 5376704 -Sir?<br />-I-- Yeah?
5376704 5379207 -The FBI is here.<br />-Oh. The FBI is here now?
5379457 5381501 Yes, sir, right over there.
5381501 5384629 -Hold this.<br />-You want a breath mint?
5387048 5389258 Uh, yeah. We got it.
5389509 5392095 Hey! How you doing, man?
5392095 5394722 I'm Agent Johnson.<br />This is Special Agent Johnson.
5394722 5397850 -Oh. How you doing?<br />-No relation.
5397850 5400895 I'm, uh--
5400895 5404690 I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.<br />I'm in charge here.

5468296 5471132 Oh!
5471132 5475303 Please, God, no. You're one of them,<br />aren't you? You're one of them.
5476137 5478890 Don't-- Don't kill me.<br />Please, don't. Please!
5478890 5481851 -Don't kill me. Don't kill me, please.<br />-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
5481851 5485938 Relax. Relax. I'm not gonna hurt you.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you!
5488608 5490735 Oh, God.
5493821 5496949 What the fuck are you doing up here?<br />What were you looking for?
5496949 5500745 I managed to get out of there, and, uh--
5500745 5502914 Well, I was just trying<br />to get up on the roof
5502914 5506000 and see if I could signal for help,<br />you know.
5507251 5509754 It's just through here.<br />Why don't you come and help--
5509754 5512798 -Whoa, whoa, whoa. Forget the roof.<br />-Come on. Come on.
5512798 5515092 I said forget the roof.<br />They got people all over it.
5517178 5519388 Come on. You wanna stay alive,<br />you stay with me.
5523142 5524727 Well, the best way we can figure it is
5524727 5528022 we've got maybe 30 or 35 hostages<br />up there,
5528022 5530233 probably on the 30th floor,
5530233 5533861 and maybe, I don't know,<br />seven or eight terrorists up there.
5533861 5536113 Sounds like an A-7 scenario.
5536113 5538157 Thank you. We'll handle it from here.
5538157 5540952 When we commandeer your men,<br />we'll try and let you know.
5541827 5543371 Aren't you forgetting something?
5543371 5544664 Such as?
5544664 5546290 What about John McClane?
5546290 5549377 He's the reason why we have<br />the information we have up until now.
5549669 5553214 He's also the reason why you're facing<br />seven terrorists instead of 12.
5553214 5555800 He's inside? Who is he?
5555800 5558386 Well, he might be a cop.<br />I don't know. We're checking on that.
5558719 5560054 One of yours?
5560054 5561305 No. No way.
5566936 5567812 Do you smoke?

5646265 5648476 You know that game with the guns<br />that shoot red paint?
5648768 5651479 Probably seems kind of stupid to you.
5652772 5653898 Well...
5656942 5658361 time for the real thing, Bill.
5667078 5669455 All you gotta do is pull the trigger.

5719338 5721924 But what do you want with the detonators,<br />Hans?
5723175 5725386 I already used all the explosives.
5728180 5729390 Or did I?

6421998 6424543 "John said that he was sorry."
6425544 6426545 Okay?
6427712 6429131 You got that, man?
6429756 6430882 <i>Yeah, I got it, John.</i>
6432175 6435011 But you can tell her that yourself.
6435011 6437764 You just watch your ass, and you'll<br />make it out of there. You hear me?
6439307 6441685 <i>Well, I guess that's up to</i><br /><i>the man upstairs.</i>
6445564 6447274 <i>John?</i>
6447274 6449276 <i>John?</i>
6449276 6451570 What the fuck were you doing upstairs,<br />Hans?
6454322 6457117 <i>-John?</i><br />-No, Al, listen.
6457117 6458743 Listen, just lay off for a while.
6460829 6462914 <i>I gotta go check on something.</i>
6466042 6468670 -One minute. That's all I'm asking.<br />-(Spanish)
6468670 6471673 One minute just to speak to you.<br />All right. All right.
6471673 6474885 All right. Get back.<br />Get back. Off. Off. All right.
6474885 6478346 Look, you let me in right now,<br />or I call the INS.
6478346 6479973 <i>Comprende?</i>
6481391 6483101 Look, this is the last time
6483101 6485687 these kids are gonna have<br />to speak to their parents.
6488273 6491902 All right? All right.<br />Come on. Come on.
6502913 6506166 What were you doing, Hans?<br />What were you doing?
6521014 6524309 (beeping)
6527938 6530690 Jesus, Mary, mother of God.
6534903 6537113 Powell, Powell, listen to me!<br />It's a double cross!
6537113 6538990 The whole roof<br />of the building's wired to--
6541993 6543954 <i>POWELL: John.</i>
6545872 6547165 <i>John.</i>
6547165 6550085 John, come in. Did you get that?
6550085 6552295 No. Something about a double cross.
6553672 6555048 Tell me about it.
6561304 6563390 We are both professionals.
6565809 6567269 This is personal.
6568728 6569813 Oh.
6590959 6592294 They're coming.
6593962 6596131 -Choppers are coming.<br />-Okay.
6596131 6599217 Time to gather your flock, Miss Gennero.
6600093 6602304 <i>THORNBURG: Your mom and dad</i><br /><i>are very important people.</i>
6602304 6605932 <i>They're very brave people.</i>
6605932 6608893 <i>So is there something you would like</i><br /><i>to say to them if they're watching?</i>
6610312 6612105 <i>Come home.</i>
6621281 6622449 Mrs. McClane.
6626202 6628747 How nice to make your acquaintance.
6629914 6632792 (screaming, shouting)
6632792 6634377 On your feet, everyone! To the roof!
6634377 6636921 Lock them up there and come right back.
6639382 6641426 MAN: Move! Come on! Let's move!
6666159 6668328 You should've heard your brother squeal
6668328 6670288 when I broke his fucking neck!
6673541 6676252 What do you figure the breakage?
6676252 6678338 Figure we take out the terrorists,
6678338 6682092 lose 20--25 percent of the hostages...<br />tops.
6682092 6684594 I can live with that.
6684886 6686137 Keep this thing on the deck.
6686137 6689474 They're expecting transports,<br />not gunships.
6701361 6704155 Move it! Come on! Move!
6704155 6705156 Come on! Come on!
6705156 6706491 Move it!
6707534 6709327 Let's go! Move!
6713039 6716000 Theo. A little bonus for us.
6716000 6718920 -Please, sit down. Sit down.<br />-Hey!
6718920 6721005 A policeman's wife might come in handy.
6721005 6723216 McClane, I have some news for you.
6724509 6725969 McClane.
6733476 6735353 (groans)
6737147 6738982 Come on! Move, move!
6741109 6743069 Come on!
6754831 6756916 Motherfucker, I'll kill you!
6760170 6763298 -(beeping)<br />-Armed. The truck?
6763298 6764424 The truck.
6772056 6773933 After all your posturing,
6773933 6775602 all your little speeches,
6775602 6777520 you're nothing but a common thief.
6779105 6781232 I am an exceptional thief, Mrs. McClane.
6781232 6784152 And since I'm moving up to kidnapping,<br />you should be more polite.
6791618 6793953 Motherfucker, I'm gonna kill you!
6793953 6795663 I'm gonna fucking cook you,
6795663 6797290 and I'm gonna fucking eat you!
6820021 6822065 I don't like this, Sarge.
6830156 6832659 (whooping)
6832659 6835954 Just like fuckin' Saigon, eh, slick?
6837539 6840124 I was in junior high, dickhead.
6857100 6859143 (panicked chattering)
6868528 6871489 Where's Holly? Where's Holly Gennero?
6871489 6873408 Holly Gennero! Where's Holly?
6873408 6875243 Where's Holly? Where is she?
6875243 6876744 -They took her!<br />-Where?
6876744 6878746 -The vault!<br />-Where is the vault?
6878746 6881291 The 30th floor. Up the stairs.<br />They just took her!
6883376 6884711 Get downstairs, all of you!
6884711 6887589 The whole fuckin' roof is wired to blow.<br />Get down!
6887589 6890341 Get down! Get the fuck downstairs!
6891050 6892427 (screaming, shouting)
6892427 6893553 They made us, Bureau.
6893553 6896055 -You got a terrorist shooting hostages.<br />-I see it. Bank left.
6903396 6905106 Nail that sucker!
6913197 6916284 I'm on your side, you assholes!
6916284 6919329 Shit. Swing around again!<br />I'll bag this little bastard.
6939098 6941100 What the fuck-- Jesus!
6943186 6945563 Oh, John, what the fuck are you doing?
6945563 6948149 How the fuck did you get into this shit?
6950276 6953446 (screaming, shouting continues)
6958743 6959744 There's something wrong.
6959744 6961412 They're coming back down.
6961412 6963748 -Blow the roof.<br />-But Karl's up there!
6963748 6965166 Blow the roof!
6968419 6971589 I promise I will never even think
6971589 6974175 about going up in a tall building again.
6977553 6979806 Oh, God. Please don't let me die.
6992610 6994779 -Holy shit!<br />-(yelling)
7021472 7023766 (panting)
7023766 7024767 (groans)
7044662 7047248 (screaming)
7047248 7048624 (shouts in French)
7071564 7073608 Holy Christ!
7075401 7077904 We're gonna need some more FBI guys,<br />I guess.
7077904 7079781 (gasping)
7087330 7088539 (dings)
7090708 7092627 Jesus fucking Christ!
7104680 7106682 (clattering)
7118903 7120905 What the fuck is going on?
7123741 7124784 HOLLY: What are you gonna do,
7124784 7126953 sit here while the building<br />falls down around your ears?
7127245 7128871 MAN (shouting in German)
7135753 7138798 -Shit!<br />-Hey! All right!
7138798 7140716 (shouts in French)
7142260 7143970 Hang on, baby.
7143970 7145596 Hang on, honey.
7145596 7147431 Oh, God.
7185344 7187847 BOTH (shouting in French)
7192560 7194061 McCLANE: Hans!
7209410 7210578 Jesus.
7211495 7212830 Hi, honey.
7235478 7237021 So that's what this was all about?
7237021 7239023 A fucking robbery?
7239023 7240566 Put down the gun.
7242568 7244612 Why did you have to nuke<br />the whole building, Hans?
7244612 7247698 When you steal $600,<br />you can just disappear.
7247698 7250785 When you steal 600 million,<br />they will find you,
7250785 7253079 unless they think you're already dead.
7253371 7255414 Put down the gun.
7262880 7264423 (gasps)
7265841 7267510 HANS:<i> Nein! </i>This is mine.
7270680 7272807 You got me.
7272807 7275601 HANS: Still the cowboy, Mr. McClane.
7275601 7277561 Americans, all alike.
7277561 7281107 Well, this time, John Wayne does not walk<br />off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
7281399 7283109 That's Gary Cooper, asshole.
7283109 7285027 Enough jokes.
7285027 7287989 You'd have made a pretty good<br />cowboy yourself, Hans.
7288906 7290157 Oh, yes.
7290157 7292451 What was it you said to me before?
7293619 7296664 Yippee-ki-yea, motherfucker.
7296664 7297915 McCLANE (laughing)
7317476 7318811 Holly!
7324483 7325776 Happy trails, Hans.
7330823 7332908 (screams)
7339790 7341667 (screams)
7370154 7372239 I hope that's not a hostage.
7398140 7401018 (siren wailing)
7401018 7404855 MAN: Give me water hook-ups for engine<br />companies five, three, nine, six.
7408692 7411278 MAN #2: Over here. It's a better angle.
7411278 7413614 MAN #1: Let's give 'em a hand over there.
7415241 7417284 Keep it going now. Keep it going.
7423082 7425126 Come on. Come on! We're gonna miss it.
7425126 7427211 -Okay, hand me my notes.<br />-Come on!
7427211 7429713 Keep that water on there.
7449733 7451610 What was it like in there?<br />How did they treat you?
7451610 7453070 Did they frighten you at all? Any comment?
7453070 7455281 It was terrible.<br />We don't wanna talk about it.
7455281 7458534 -REPORTER: How does it feel to be outside?<br />-(mouths words)
7484310 7486187 (laughing)
7491775 7493194 (laughing)
7495321 7496947 (sighs)
7499950 7501994 Al, this is my wife Holly.
7501994 7503245 Holly Gennero.
7504288 7507958 -Holly McClane.<br />-Hello, Holly.
7507958 7509835 You got yourself a good man.
7509835 7511378 You take good care of him.
7512713 7514131 -ROBINSON: McClane?<br />-MAN: Yeah, it's okay. Let him through.
7514131 7516342 McClane, I wanna debrief.
7516342 7520179 I want a debriefing.<br />You got some things to answer for, mister.
7520179 7523265 Ellis's murder, for one thing.<br />Property damage.
7523265 7525351 Interfering with police business.
7525351 7527853 (screaming)
7565975 7569061 ROBINSON: All right, I want two of you to<br />go inside and see if there's anybody else.
7569061 7571105 MAN: Yes, sir. I'll take the left.
7578821 7580406 -MAN: Watch it!<br />-Whoa.
7580739 7582366 This one's with me.
7589164 7592418 -(horn honking)<br />-MAN: Five, four, three, two.
7592710 7595170 Mr. McClane. Mr. McClane,<br />now that it's all over,
7595170 7598257 after this incredible ordeal,<br />what are your feelings?
7599383 7602136 BYSTANDERS (laughing)
7603804 7605222 Well, well, well.
7606181 7608267 -Merry Christmas, Argyle.<br />-Merry Christmas.
7612980 7614023 Did you get that?
7614023 7617192 Let me through. Let me through.<br />Thank you.
7617192 7620279 If this is their idea of Christmas,<br />I gotta be here for New Year's.
