56473 58516 You don't like flying, do you?
59601 61644 What gives you that idea?
64064 67442 You want to know the secret<br />to surviving air travel?
68693 71696 After you get where you're going,<br />take off your shoes and socks.
71738 76326 Then you walk around on the rug barefoot<br />and make fists with your toes.
77535 79746 Fists with your toes?
80497 82123 I know. It sounds crazy.
82165 84292 Trust me.<br />I've been doing it for nine years.
84334 88046 Yes, sir! Better than a shower<br />and a hot cup of coffee.
89005 90048 OK.
100100 101851 It's OK. I'm a cop.
104187 108024 Trust me.<br />I've been doing this for 11 years.
109025 110860 <i>On behalf of the captain and the crew,</i>
110902 113029 <i>I'd like to welcome you to Los Angeles.</i>
113071 115865 <i>Have a very merry Christmas.</i>
124541 128878 <i>Flight 247 to Tucson<br />now boarding at gate 14.</i>
130130 134926 <i>Flight 247 to Tucson<br />now boarding at gate 14.</i>
149566 151026 How do you do?
163580 165415 Ladies and gentlemen...
165457 166916 Ladies and gentlemen!
167876 170211 I want to congratulate<br />each and every one of you
170253 172547 for making this<br />one of the greatest years
172589 175425 in the history<br />of the Nakatomi Corporation.
178720 181848 On behalf of the Chief<br />Executive Officer, Mr Ozu,
181890 183975 and the Board of Directors,
184017 185226 we thank you one and all
185268 188355 and wish you a merry Christmas<br />and a happy New Year!
188396 191900 Merry Christmas!<br />Happy New Year!
192275 195737 Hey, Holly.<br />What about dinner tonight?
196112 198531 Harry, it's Christmas Eve.
198573 201618 Families, stockings...
202911 204621 Chestnuts?
205205 206998 Rudolph and Frosty?
207040 209084 Any of these things ring a bell?
209125 210919 Actually, I was thinking more of
210960 214506 mulled wine, a nice aged Brie
214547 217759 and a roaring fireplace.<br />You know what I'm saying?
220887 224140 Ginny, it's 5.40. Go join the party.<br />Have some champagne.
224182 226685 You're making me feel<br />like Ebenezer Scrooge.
226726 230438 Thanks. Do you think the baby<br />can handle a little sip?
230480 233608 That baby's ready to tend bar.
234317 235527 Last chance.
235568 236820 Bye.
243243 246204 McClane residence.<br />Lucy McClane speaking.
246579 250041 Hello, Lucy McClane.<br />This is your mother speaking.
250834 253712 <i>Mommy!<br />When are you coming home?</i>
253753 255338 Pretty soon.
255380 258049 You'll be in bed<br />when I get there, though.
258091 260427 Let me talk to Paulina, OK, hon?
260844 264597 And no snooping around the house<br />looking for presents.
265181 267684 Is Daddy coming home with you?
269769 271312 Well, we'll see what
271354 273732 Santa and Mommy can do, OK?
274357 275984 Put Paulina on. Bye, honey.
276526 278028 <i>Paulina!</i>
283283 284743 Hola, Mrs Holly.
285076 287537 Um, did Mr McClane call?
288079 290457 <i>No, Mrs Holly. No telefono.</i>
291374 294377 He probably didn't have time<br />before his flight.
295420 297339 It might be a good idea<br />to make up the spare bedroom
297380 298923 just in case.
298965 301593 Si, Mrs Holly. I do that already.
301968 304637 What would I do without you, Paulina?
330163 331581 California!
344719 346429 Hey, I'm John McClane.
346471 347514 Argyle.
347555 349432 I'm your limo driver.
352686 353978 Nice bear.
358024 360318 OK... Argyle.
360902 362320 What do we do now?
362362 365115 I was, uh, hoping you could tell me.
365156 367033 It's my first time driving a limo.
367575 370078 That's OK.<br />It's my first time riding in one.
370537 373248 Relax.<br />We got everything in this mug, man.
373289 376126 Look at this... CD, CB, TV,
376501 379587 telephone, full bar, VHS.
380547 382257 If your friend's hot to trot,
382298 385176 I know a few mama bears<br />we can hook up with.
386469 388138 Or is he married?
388179 389389 He's married.
389431 390432 OK.
393059 395812 Sorry about that.<br />It's the girl's day off.
395854 398106 I didn't know<br />you were gonna sit up front.
398148 400066 Your lady live out here?
400108 401651 About the past six months.
402485 405030 Meaning you still live in New York?
405780 408783 You always ask<br />this many questions, Argyle?
408825 413163 Sorry. I used to drive a cab<br />and people would expect a little chitchat.
413705 416958 -So, you divorced?<br />-Just drive the car, man.
417000 420712 Hey, come on. You divorced?<br />You separated? She beat you up?
424049 427761 She had a good job.<br />It turned into a great career.
427802 432349 -That meant she had to move here.<br />-You're very fast, Argyle.
433016 435018 So, why didn't you come?
438188 439272 Well?
439314 441524 Why didn't you come with her?
441941 443777 Because I'm a New York cop.
443818 447530 I got a backlog of New York scumbags<br />I'm still trying to put behind bars.
447572 449491 I can't just go that easy.
449532 451743 You thought she wasn't<br />gonna make it out here
451785 455872 and she'd come crawling back to you<br />so why bother to pack, right?
456956 459584 Like I said, you're very fast, Argyle.
460001 462128 Mind if we hear some tunes?
465006 467050 Hey, that'll work.
469761 471179 Don't you got any Christmas music?
471596 474057 This is Christmas music.
503586 505880 So your lady sees you,<br />you run into each other's arms,
505922 509551 the music comes up<br />and you live happily ever after, right?
509843 511553 I can live with that.
512721 516099 So, if it doesn't work out,<br />you got a place to stay?
516391 518018 I'll find a place.
519185 520437 I tell you what...
520478 525066 I'll wait in the parking garage. You score,<br />give me a call on the car phone.
525108 529487 I'll take your bags to the desk.<br />You strike out, I'll get you a hotel.
529529 533700 -You're all right, Argyle.<br />-Remember that when you sign for the tip.
557807 559893 -Hi.<br />-Good evening.
560310 562270 I'm here to see Holly McClane.
562312 564230 Just type it in there.
570528 571613 Cute toy.
572197 574866 Yeah, if you have to take a leak,<br />it'll even help you find your zipper.
591800 592926 Christ.
598932 601142 -Thirtieth floor?<br />-The party.
601393 603061 They're the only ones<br />left in the building.
603103 604479 Take the express elevator.
604521 606439 Get off where you hear the noise.
606898 608191 Thanks.
666583 669085 -Champagne, sir?<br />-Yeah, thanks.
703828 705914 Oh, I'm sorry.
705955 708500 Hey! Merry Christmas!
712087 713296 Jesus.
714547 716091 Fuckin' California!
716132 718218 I couldn't agree with you more.
718718 720136 Why don't I talk to him right now?
721930 724099 Hi. I'm looking for...
724140 726101 -Holly Gennero.<br />-Yeah.
726142 727602 Then you must be John McClane.
727644 730105 Joe Takagi.<br />How was your ride in?
730146 732691 Nice. I have you to thank for that?
732732 734943 Seemed the least we could do.
734984 738738 -Quite a place you have here.<br />-It will be if we ever get it finished.
738780 740782 Still several floors under construction.
740824 744911 Holly went to fax some documents.<br />She should be back any minute.
744953 748331 In the meanwhile,<br />her office is back here.
751042 752210 Ellis?
753837 756506 I was just making a call.<br />This was the nearest phone.
756548 758967 I want you to meet John McClane,
759009 760593 Holly's husband.
761511 763263 Holly's policeman.
763304 765765 Ellis is in charge<br />of international development.
765807 767726 Heard a lot about you.
768351 770020 You missed some.
771604 772939 Can I get you anything?
772981 776026 Food? Cake?<br />Some watered-down champagne?
776484 778528 No, thank you. I'm fine.
779821 781740 You throw quite a party.
782907 785785 I didn't realize they celebrated<br />Christmas in Japan.
785827 786995 We're flexible.
787037 790832 Pearl Harbor didn't work out,<br />so we got you with tape decks.
793126 796921 It's sort of a double celebration.<br />We closed a pretty big deal today
796963 798214 and a lot of it was due to Holly.<br />Right, Joe?
798840 801092 I'll be out in a couple of minutes.
806473 807807 John.
811811 813813 Have you met everyone?
813855 815523 We've been sticking him with spears.
815565 817233 Of course he has.
818109 821154 She was made for the business.<br />Tough as nails.
821738 824115 I was hoping you made that flight.
824866 826951 Show him the watch.
827369 828536 Later.
828912 831039 Show him. Are you embarrassed?
831081 832665 It's just a small token of appreciation
832707 835543 for all her hard work. It's a Rolex.
836753 838588 I'm sure I'll see it later.
839047 841633 Is there a place<br />where I could wash up?
842092 843218 Sure.
858942 860151 You have to forgive Ellis.
860193 862946 He gets very depressed<br />this time of year.
863488 866574 He thought he was<br />God's greatest gift, you know?
866616 868284 I know the type.
868993 871287 I think he's got his eye on you.
872163 875458 That's OK. I have my eye<br />on his private bathroom.
876251 879170 Where are you staying?<br />Things happened so fast
879212 882298 I didn't get a chance<br />to ask you on the phone.
882340 884843 Cappy Roberts retired out here.
884884 885927 Oh, yeah?
885969 887387 He said I could bunk with him.
887429 889931 Cappy retired, huh?<br />Where's he live?
890306 893518 -Romona.<br />-Ha! Pomona.
893810 895812 -Huh?<br />-Pomona.
896104 897939 -Pomona.<br />-Yeah.
898732 901192 You'll be in the car half the time.
902652 905989 Why don't we make it easy?<br />I have a spare bedroom.
906239 908658 It's not huge or anything, but
908992 911995 the kids would love to have you<br />at the house.
913663 915248 They would, huh?
918668 920170 I would, too.
923965 925175 Sorry.
932557 934017 I missed you.
941566 943943 Didn't miss my name, though, huh?
944527 947364 Except maybe<br />when you're signing checks?
947781 950575 Since when did you start using<br />Ms Gennero?
953203 956581 This is a Japanese company.<br />They figure a married woman's...
956623 958541 You are a married woman.
958583 961378 This conversation again?<br />We did this in July.
961419 962671 We never finished this conversation.
962712 964923 I had an opportunity. I had to take it.
964964 967425 No matter what it did to our marriage.
967467 970887 It only changed your idea<br />of our marriage.
970929 972639 You have no clue what my idea...
972681 976559 I know exactly what your idea<br />of our marriage should be.
976976 978728 Ms Gennero, I...
980605 981940 Excuse me.
982899 983983 Hi.
985527 987529 Um, Mr Takagi is looking for you.
987570 990031 He wants you to say something<br />to the troops.
990073 991408 Thank you.
995829 997247 Speech time.
997539 999541 Be back in a few minutes.
1011261 1013221 That was great, John.
1013263 1015932 Good job. Very mature.
1065648 1067359 So Kareem rebounds.
1067400 1070945 Feeds Worthy on the break,<br />over to AC, to Magic,
1070987 1072697 then back to Worthy.
1073698 1075408 Boom! Two points.
1079746 1080747 We're in.
1230438 1231731 Links,
1234484 1235527 rechts,
1235568 1237362 und wieder links.
1267851 1269394 Son of a bitch.
1272689 1274524 Fists with your toes.
1306056 1307474 Yeah, Argyle?
1307515 1309100 <i>How's it going?</i>
1309142 1310685 All right. Where are you?
1310727 1313688 Down at the garage.<br />What's with you and your lady?
1314314 1316024 The vote's not in yet.
1324908 1326743 -Hey, Bruder.<br />-Moment.
1327911 1329412 Nein! Nein! Nein!
1347806 1348932 Argyle?
1349557 1351601 Mac, you there? Hello?
1360777 1362195 You know the number. Use it.
1454537 1457248 Stay calm.<br />Everything's going to be fine.
1457665 1459376 Everything's going to be fine.
1478812 1480230 Shit!
1483733 1484776 Think.
1485151 1486319 Think.
1502627 1504879 Ladies and gentlemen.
1506589 1508425 Ladies and gentlemen.
1515557 1519728 Due to the Nakatomi Corporation's<br />legacy of greed around the globe
1519769 1523648 they're about to be taught a lesson<br />in the real use of power.
1525150 1527110 You will be witnesses.
1529696 1530697 Now
1531823 1533700 where is Mr Takagi?
1536453 1539289 Joseph Yashinobo Takagi,
1540999 1543084 born Kyoto, 1937.
1543126 1544627 Don't move.
1545503 1549215 Family emigrated to San Pedro,<br />California, 1939,
1550759 1555055 interned at Manzanar, 1942 to '43,
1556348 1560018 scholarship student,<br />University of California,
1560477 1562312 1955.
1566358 1570528 Law degree, Stanford, 1962.
1571154 1574491 MBA, Harvard, 1970.
1575909 1578161 President, Nakatomi Trading.
1578828 1581581 Vice Chairman,<br />Nakatomi Investment Group...
1581998 1583208 Enough.
1584167 1585960 And father
1586002 1587337 of five.
1587837 1589297 I am Takagi.
1590674 1592300 How do you do?
1593468 1595553 It's a pleasure to meet you.
1607524 1610527 OK, 32... construction,<br />33... computers.
1624624 1626042 Nice suit.
1626626 1628712 John Phillips, London.
1630797 1632465 I have two myself.
1633675 1636511 Rumor has it<br />Arafat buys his there.
1641641 1644185 -This way?<br />-On the left.
1666416 1669961 And when Alexander saw<br />the breadth of his domain
1670003 1673882 he wept, for there were<br />no more worlds to conquer.
1678636 1681264 The benefits of a classical education.
1682390 1685018 Ohh, that's beautiful.
1687270 1689898 I always enjoyed to make models<br />when I was a boy.
1689939 1694652 The exactness, the attention<br />to every conceivable detail.
1695445 1696905 It's beautiful.
1697238 1700784 Is this what this is all about?<br />Our project in Indonesia?
1701618 1704245 Contrary to what you people may think,
1704621 1707749 we're going to develop<br />that region, not exploit it.
1707791 1712212 I believe you.<br />I read the article in <i>Forbes.</i>
1714756 1716174 Mr Takagi,
1717759 1721054 I could talk about industrialization<br />and men's fashions all day
1721096 1723264 but I'm afraid work must intrude
1723306 1726518 and my associate here<br />has some questions for you.
1727435 1730480 Sort of fill-in-the-blanks questions,<br />actually.
1740365 1742158 I don't have that code.
1742784 1745537 You broke in here<br />to access our computer?
1746496 1747664 Any information you could get
1747706 1749916 when they wake up in Tokyo,<br />they'll change it.
1749958 1752335 You won't be able to blackmail<br />our executives...
1752377 1754421 Sit... down!
1765098 1768768 Mr Takagi, I'm really not<br />interested in your computer.
1773648 1775525 But I need the code key
1776192 1780655 because I am interested<br />in the $640 million
1780697 1785160 in negotiable bearer bonds<br />that you have locked in your vault
1785201 1788371 and the computer<br />controls the vault.
1790165 1791708 You want money?
1792542 1794961 What kind of terrorists are you?
1798381 1800550 Who said we were terrorists?
1820195 1822947 The bonds represent, at most
1822989 1826701 10 days' operating capital<br />for your parent organization.
1826743 1829913 It's really no more<br />than a temporary inconvenience.
1830163 1831206 Now...
1835752 1837671 the code, please.
1838713 1840298 It's useless to you.
1840340 1843301 There are seven safeguards on our vault<br />and the code key's only one of them.
1843343 1844719 You'll never get it open.
1844761 1847639 Then there's no reason<br />not to tell it to us.
1848473 1851726 -I told you.<br />-It's not over yet.
1856856 1860068 It's a very nice suit, Mr Takagi.
1861111 1863446 It would be a shame to ruin it.
1866574 1868952 I'm going to count to three.
1869953 1872205 There will not be a four.
1873623 1875792 Give me the code.
1877252 1878336 One,
1881172 1882382 two,
1884801 1886886 -three.<br />-I don't know it.
1887387 1889389 Get on a jet to Tokyo<br />and ask the chairman.
1889431 1891766 You're just gonna have to kill me.
1892100 1893143 OK.
1896604 1898398 We do it the hard way.
1898440 1900400 Tony, see if you can dispose of that.
1900442 1904446 Karl, you better check on Heinrich's work<br />up on the machine floor.
1929054 1930347 Nothing.
1930597 1932265 See to Heinrich.
1933850 1935018 Now
1935685 1938313 you can break the code?
1939022 1942484 You didn't bring me<br />for my charming personality.
1948531 1951451 Argyle, tell me you heard the shots.
1951493 1953078 You're calling the police right now.
1953536 1956039 Of course I'm still coming by later.
1956790 1959334 Sweetheart, have I ever lied to you?
1959709 1962379 My boss? He thinks<br />I'm on my way to Vegas.
1963546 1965548 Uli, get up on the pipes.
1966758 1968885 Marco, you go through here.
1970720 1972555 I'll throw you the cord.
1977310 1979396 Hans, we're on the roof.
1991700 1992867 Here.
1996413 1997497 Uli.
2005046 2006548 30 minutes to break the code,
2006589 2011761 two hours, two and a half hours<br />for the five mechanicals, at the minimum.
2012429 2015598 The 7th lock, however,<br />is out of my hands.
2038288 2039414 I'm sorry?
2039456 2042250 The 7th lock...<br />the electromagnetic seal.
2042876 2046129 You do understand the circuits<br />cannot be cut locally?
2047005 2048256 Trust me.
2049924 2052969 Why the fuck<br />didn't you stop him, John?
2054262 2057140 'Cause then you'd be dead, too,<br />asshole.
2057182 2059184 Think, goddamn it! Think!
2071654 2073573 We've got a fire alarm.
2074157 2075408 Call 911.
2075658 2079704 Give them the guard's name<br />and cancel the alarm.
2079746 2081247 Then disable the sys...
2084584 2087504 Eddie, on what floor<br />did the alarm go off?
2089297 2091091 Shall we go?
2091341 2092550 Nein.
2103645 2104813 Yes.
2104854 2107649 Hello, baby.<br />Come to Papa. Come on.
2108274 2110402 Ah ha ha ha!
2112112 2113446 Come on, baby.
2113488 2114656 Come on, baby.
2114698 2116032 Come on, baby. Come to Papa.
2116074 2118535 I'll kiss your fuckin' Dalmatian.
2121371 2123790 You stupid motherfuckers!<br />No! No!
2124290 2126209 Turn the fuckin' truck around!
2159826 2162912 The fire has been called off, my friend.
2167917 2170170 No-one is coming to help you.
2173965 2177218 You might as well come out<br />and join the others.
2179846 2181931 I promise I won't hurt you.
2211044 2214214 Drop it, dickhead. It's the police.
2214881 2216341 You won't hurt me.
2216383 2218134 Yeah? Why not?
2218802 2220387 Because you're a policeman.
2220428 2222681 There are rules for policemen.
2222722 2226226 Yeah, that's what my captain<br />keeps telling me.
2292876 2295545 Bet your ass I wish to proceed.
2335627 2337087 Nine million terrorists in the world
2337128 2340590 and I got to kill one with feet<br />smaller than my sister.
2390473 2392892 I wanted this to be professional,
2393309 2394853 efficient, adult, cooperative.
2394894 2396521 Not a lot to ask.
2396855 2399024 Alas, your Mr Takagi<br />did not see it that way
2399065 2402736 so he won't be joining us<br />for the rest of his life.
2404779 2406698 We can go any way you want it.
2408158 2411036 You can walk out of here<br />or be carried out
2411453 2415498 but have no illusions...<br />we are in charge.
2416541 2419502 So... decide now, each of you
2420754 2422714 and please remember
2423923 2426259 we have left nothing to chance.
2430847 2432349 It's Tony!
2434768 2436269 Get them back!
2445570 2448031 Now I have a machine gun.
2449699 2452994 Ho... ho... ho.
2456206 2457832 A security guard we missed?
2457874 2462462 They're usually tired old policemen.<br />No, this is something else.
2473223 2474974 We have to do something, Hans.
2475016 2476226 Yes, we do.
2476935 2479270 Tell Karl his brother is dead.
2480063 2481398 Tell him to come down.
2482399 2484401 Karl... komm sofort.
2485318 2487487 Franco, Fritz, take the body upstairs
2487529 2488571 and out of sight.
2488613 2490907 I don't want the hostages<br />to think too much.
2492325 2493868 Komm sofort. Schnell.
2556431 2557766 I want blood!
2557807 2560268 You'll have it, but let<br />Heinrich plant the detonators
2560310 2562771 and Theo prepare the vault.<br />After we call the police,
2562812 2566274 you can tear the building apart<br />looking for this man
2566316 2569611 but until then,<br />do not alter the plan!
2569944 2571905 And if he alters it?
2577160 2578828 What do you think?
2580789 2582874 Something's wrong.
2582916 2584250 Cops?
2586336 2588838 -John.<br />-John?
2589589 2591424 He can fuck this whole thing up.
2591466 2592967 What does he think he's doing?
2593009 2594094 His job.
2594135 2597555 Bullshit.<br />His job's 3,000 miles away.
2597597 2601101 Without him, we still have<br />a chance to get out of here.
2602185 2604020 Tell that to Takagi.

3721137 3722222 Theo.
3722889 3724099 Theo.
3724140 3725141 Yo!
3725642 3728812 <i>We may have some problems.<br />How's our schedule?</i>
3729646 3731272 Three down, four to go.
3731314 3732482 <i>Then don't waste time</i>
3732524 3734526 talking to me.
3734567 3735860 <i>This is Sergeant Al Powell</i>
3735902 3737987 of the Los Angeles<br />Police Department.
3738029 3739322 If the person who radioed for help
3739364 3740949 can hear me on this channel,
3740990 3742909 <i>acknowledge this transmission.</i>
3743159 3744244 <i>I say again,</i>
3744828 3747706 if the person who radioed<br />for help can hear me,
3747747 3749833 acknowledge this transmission!
3754504 3757132 I read you, pal.<br />You the guy in the car?
3757590 3759217 What's left of him.
3759259 3760969 <i>Can you identify yourself?</i>
3761011 3762846 Not now. Maybe later.
3763179 3764514 Listen fast. This is a party line.
3764556 3766683 The neighbors got itchy trigger fingers.
3766725 3768226 All right, here's the deal.
3768268 3770437 You got 30 or so hostages<br />on the 30th floor.
3770854 3771980 <i>The leader's name is Hans.</i>
3772022 3773565 We have to find him and shut him up.
3773606 3774733 He's telling them everything!
3774774 3776901 Let him. I'm waiting for the FBI.
3776943 3778653 He can waste<br />as much time as he likes
3778695 3781948 but we must find the bag, Fritz.
3781990 3783324 <i>They have a freakin' arsenal here.</i>
3783366 3785326 We must have the detonators.
3785368 3787370 <i>They got missiles, automatic weapons,</i>
3787412 3790165 <i>and enough plastic explosives<br />to orbit Arnold Schwarzenegger.</i>
3790206 3793335 They're down to nine now,<br />counting the skydiver you met.
3793376 3794794 These guys are mostly European
3794836 3797339 judging by their clothing labels and
3804387 3805972 cigarettes.
3806014 3808850 They're well-financed and very slick.
3808892 3810352 How do you know that?
3810393 3812187 <i>I've seen enough phony IDs in my time</i>
3812228 3816066 to recognize the ones they got<br />must have cost a fortune.
3818360 3820820 Add all that up. I don't know<br />what the fuck it means
3820862 3822655 but you got<br />some bad-ass perpetrators
3822697 3824407 and they're here to stay.
3826034 3827535 I hear you, partner.
3827577 3828995 LA's finest are on it,
3829037 3830413 <i>so light 'em if you got 'em.</i>
3831081 3833124 Way ahead of you, partner.
3834417 3836002 <i>So what do I call you?</i>
3837921 3839047 Call me...
3841049 3842050 Roy.
3842092 3845428 Listen up, Roy,<br />if you think of anything else,
3845470 3847222 don't be shy, OK?
3847263 3850308 In the meantime, find a safe place<br />and let us do our job.
3851101 3852936 <i>They're all yours, Al.</i>
3870870 3872372 Who's talking to 'em?
3873206 3876251 I am, sir.<br />Sergeant Powell. Al Powell.
3876710 3878545 Dwayne Robinson. What's the deal?
3878586 3880547 What do these pricks want?
3880588 3882716 If you mean the terrorists,
3883299 3885093 we haven't heard a peep from them.
3885135 3887387 Who have you been talking to?
3888096 3890974 We don't know.<br />He won't give us his name.
3891349 3893935 But he appears to be<br />the one who phoned.
3893977 3897063 He's killed one terrorist for sure<br />and claims he capped off two others.
3897105 3898314 He claims?
3899274 3900608 Powell, has it occurred to you
3900650 3903486 he could be<br />one of the terrorists pulling your chain
3903528 3905155 or some nutcase in there?
3905196 3908241 I don't think so.<br />In fact, I think he's a cop,
3908575 3911244 maybe not LAPD,<br />but he's definitely a badge.
3911286 3914497 -How do you know that?<br />-A hunch... things he said
3914956 3917000 like being able to spot a phony ID.
3917042 3919461 Jesus Christ, Powell!
3919502 3922297 He could be a fucking bartender<br />for all we know!
3922339 3923840 TV's here.
3924466 3926092 Oh, shit.
3943109 3944527 I have a request.
3945278 3947030 What idiot put you in charge?
3947072 3948323 You did
3949449 3951451 when you murdered my boss.
3951951 3954245 Now everybody's looking to me.
3954287 3955830 Personally, I'd pass on the job.
3955872 3958541 I don't enjoy being this close to you.
3967384 3968593 Go on.
3969511 3971471 We have a pregnant woman.
3971513 3973932 Relax. She's not due<br />for a couple weeks
3973973 3976976 but sitting on that rock<br />isn't doing her back any good.
3977018 3980397 So I'd like permission to move her<br />to an office with a sofa.
3982232 3985193 No, but I'll have a sofa<br />brought out. Good enough?
3985235 3986611 Good enough.
3987153 3988530 And unless you like it messy,
3988571 3990824 start bringing us<br />in groups to the bathroom.
3993076 3994869 Yes. You're right.
3994911 3996579 It will be done.
3997247 3999082 Was there something else?
4000834 4002419 No, thank you.
4008883 4011720 Mr Takagi<br />chose his people well, Mrs...?
4012595 4013596 Gennero.
4015390 4017934 Ms Gennero.
4020687 4023231 <i>We interrupt this programme<br />for a special news bulletin.</i>
4023273 4026234 <i>This is Richard Thornburg<br />live from Century City.</i>
4027152 4029404 <i>Tonight, Los Angeles has joined</i>
4029446 4032574 <i>the sad and worldwide<br />fraternity of cities</i>
4032615 4034117 <i>whose only membership requirement</i>
4034159 4037245 <i>is to suffer the anguish<br />of international terrorism.</i>
4037746 4042083 <i>Approximately two hours ago,<br />an unidentified group of men</i>
4042125 4044669 <i>seized control<br />of the Nakatomi building,</i>
4044711 4047130 <i>sealing off all entrances and exits.</i>
4047172 4049507 <i>All telephone lines have been cut</i>
4049549 4051926 <i>and the only communication<br />now possible</i>
4051968 4054763 <i>has been through the use<br />of CB communicators</i>
4054804 4057223 <i>which the group<br />apparently brought with them.</i>
4057265 4059100 <i>According to official sources,</i>
4059142 4061603 <i>the perpetrators of this building siege...</i>
4061644 4064397 <i>Unit five,<br />hold your position in the main entrance.</i>
4064773 4066983 We got Charlie unit in position
4067025 4068943 by the parking structure.
4068985 4070278 Let me ask you something.
4070320 4072781 Does this stairway<br />go up to the escalator?
4072822 4073823 Yeah.
4074115 4075909 Tell them to go ahead.
4076826 4078495 What's going on?
4079287 4081206 What's it look like? We're going in.
4081247 4083917 Going in? Man, that's crazy!
4083958 4086419 There could be over 30 hostages<br />in there for all we know.
4086461 4088213 We don't know shit, Powell.
4088254 4091883 If there's hostages, how come<br />there were no ransom demands?
4091925 4095470 If there's terrorists in there,<br />where's their list of demands?
4095512 4097555 All we know is that<br />somebody shot your car up.
4097597 4099766 It's probably the same silly son of a bitch
4099808 4101726 you've been talking to on that radio.
4101768 4103436 Excuse me, sir,
4104104 4106981 but what about the body<br />that fell out the window?
4107023 4108983 Probably some stockbroker<br />got depressed.
4109025 4110110 We're ready, Chief.
4110151 4112570 -Light 'em up. Let's go.<br />-Hit your lights.
4112612 4115532 -Blue units, go.<br />-Lights on!
4127460 4128628 Powell?
4130046 4133174 Powell, you still with me, babe?<br />What's going on?
4133216 4134592 Yo, Al.
4134634 4137178 I'm here, Roy,<br />but I'm kind of busy right now.
4137220 4138430 I'll talk to you later.
4138471 4139514 Al, what's wrong?
4139556 4141391 I'll talk to you later.
4141975 4143143 If you are what I think you are,
4143184 4145729 you'll know when to listen,<br />shut up, and
4147397 4149399 and when to pray.
4149649 4151693 Jesus Christ!<br />You're coming in, right?
4152444 4153486 Christ, Powell,
4153528 4155447 I told you what kind of people<br />you're dealing with here.
4155488 4157490 Let's load them up.
4161745 4164372 They'll be coming.<br />Everyone get ready.
4164414 4167083 <i>Theo, you are the eyes now.</i>
4179763 4180889 -Rivers.<br />-Yo.
4180930 4183725 Begin your reconnoiter.
4184351 4185602 Let's go.
4188938 4190106 Shit!
4209459 4211711 Come on. Let's go.
4221721 4223431 Ow! Jesus!
4257507 4259342 All right, spread out.
4286036 4287328 Shut up.
4289039 4290373 Let's go.
4295712 4297589 You macho assholes. No! No!
4300800 4303553 Ahem... all right. Listen up, guys.

4326409 4328578 Right. Let's do it.
4343927 4345345 Take cover!
4345762 4347305 They're shooting at 'em.
4347347 4349557 It's panic fire.<br />They can't see anything.
4349599 4351518 They're shooting at the lights.
4355897 4359442 They're going after the lights.<br />Call them back.
4360443 4361569 It's not happening.
4361611 4363113 Mike, burn it.
4365115 4366783 Don't be impatient.
4367617 4369452 <i>Just wound them.</i>
4371287 4373832 Get them back.<br />They're sitting ducks without lights.
4374082 4375917 They're almost in.
4375959 4377127 Send in the car.
4377377 4378420 Send in the car.
4392308 4393727 Jesus Christ!
4397814 4399441 Rivers, Rodriguez, report.
4399482 4402444 Wait a minute.<br />What have we here, gentlemen?

4644269 4645311 <i>We've had an update</i>

4651943 4655071 <i>A member of the radical<br />West German Volksfrei movement.</i>

4666708 4668251 Yeah, I'm fine.

4673965 4676760 There you go.<br />Is the building on fire?
4677093 4678470 No, but it's gonna need a paint job
4678511 4680430 and a shitload of screen doors.
4680472 4682766 Our spotter said you got two<br />with that blast.

4752669 4754796 Yeah, thanks, partner.
4760844 4762262 What are you doing?
4762303 4763596 I'm tired of sitting here
4763638 4765890 waiting to see<br />who gets us killed first,
4765932 4767726 them or your husband.
4767767 4769269 What are you going to do?
4769310 4770311 Hey, babe,
4770353 4772063 I negotiate million-dollar deals<br />for breakfast.
4772105 4774733 I think I can handle this Eurotrash.
4774774 4777819 Hey, sprechen sie talk, huh?
4777861 4780572 If you'd listened to me,<br />he would be neutralized already.
4780613 4783033 I don't want neutral. I want dead.
4784534 4785952 Hope I'm not interrupting.
4785994 4787579 What does he want?
4787620 4790707 It's not what I want.<br />It's what I can give you.
4798423 4800550 Look, let's be straight, OK?
4801634 4803178 It's obvious you're not<br />some dumb schmuck
4803219 4805221 up here to snatch a few purses.
4805722 4807349 You're very perceptive.
4807390 4808767 I watch 60 Minutes.
4808808 4811519 I say to myself,<br />these guys are professional,
4811561 4814022 they're motivated, they're happening,
4814064 4815690 they want something.
4816149 4818651 I couldn't care less<br />about your politics.
4818693 4820695 Maybe you're pissed off<br />at the camel jockeys.
4820737 4822113 Maybe it's the Hebes,<br />Northern Ireland.
4822155 4823698 It's none of my business.
4823740 4826534 I figure you're here<br />to negotiate, am I right?
4826576 4827619 You're amazing.
4827660 4829996 You figured this all out already?
4830038 4832332 Hey, business is business.
4832374 4834209 You use a gun,<br />I use a fountain pen.
4834250 4835543 What's the difference?
4835585 4836711 Let's put it in my terms.
4836753 4838129 You're here on a hostile takeover.
4838171 4839506 You grab us for some green
4839547 4842884 but you didn't expect some poison pill<br />was gonna be running around the building.
4842926 4844344 Am I right?
4844386 4845595 Hans,
4846012 4847305 bubbie...
4847597 4849474 I'm your white knight.
4851059 4853103 I must have missed 60 Minutes.
4853144 4854938 What are you saying?
4856690 4859901 The guy upstairs<br />who's fucking things up, huh?
4864280 4866241 I can give him to you.
4869661 4871037 <i>Oh, God...</i>
4873081 4875458 Roy? Roy, you all right?
4876710 4879963 Just trying to fire down<br />a 1,000-year-old Twinkie.
4881214 4882257 What do they put in these things,
4882298 4883341 <i>anyway?</i>
4883717 4885552 Sugar, enriched flour,
4885593 4887679 partially hydrogenated<br />vegetable oil,
4887721 4889180 polysorbate 60,
4889222 4890932 <i>and yellow dye number five.</i>
4891474 4893935 <i>Just everything<br />a growing boy needs.</i>
4894561 4896438 How many kids you got, Al?
4896479 4899858 <i>As a matter of fact,<br />my wife is working on our first.</i>
4900817 4902277 How about you, cowboy?
4902819 4904779 You got any kids<br />back on your ranch?
4906281 4907490 Yeah.
4907824 4908908 Two.
4909826 4910994 Sure hope I can see them
4911036 4913329 swinging on a jungle gym<br />with Al Jnr someday.
4915957 4917792 <i>Well, now, that's a date</i>
4917834 4919961 <i>but you bring the ice cream.</i>
4920420 4922672 <i>Touching, cowboy. Touching.</i>
4923590 4924841 <i>Or should I call you</i>
4925508 4927635 Mr McClane?
4928428 4931139 Mr Officer John McClane
4931181 4933850 <i>of the New York<br />Police Department?</i>
4935435 4937687 Get on the phone to Harry in New York.
4938021 4939981 You better get a hold of somebody<br />at Dispatch.
4940732 4944194 Sister Theresa called me<br />Mr McClane in the third grade.
4944861 4946738 My friends call me John
4947322 4949074 and you're neither, shithead.
4950700 4953411 I have someone<br />who wants to talk to you.
4954454 4955747 A very special friend
4955789 4958375 <i>who was with you<br />at the party tonight.</i>
4964339 4966466 Hey, John boy.
4967717 4969219 Ellis?
4969469 4970845 <i>Yeah.</i>
4970887 4974849 <i>Listen, John, they're giving me<br />a few minutes to talk sense into you.</i>
4975141 4978019 I know you think you're doing your job<br />and I can appreciate that
4978061 4979771 <i>but you're just dragging<br />this thing out.</i>
4980063 4982941 <i>Look, no-one gets out of here<br />until these guys</i>
4982982 4984693 can talk to the LA Police.
4984734 4988154 That won't happen until you stop<br />messing up the works. Capisce?
4993702 4995412 Ellis, what have you told them?
4996913 4999541 I told them we were old friends<br />and you were my guest
4999582 5001084 at the party.
5002210 5004337 Ellis, you shouldn't be doing this.
5004379 5006047 Tell me about it.
5012095 5013763 All right, John, listen.
5014848 5017350 <i>They want you to tell them<br />where the detonators are.</i>
5017392 5019477 <i>They know people are listening.</i>
5020270 5023398 <i>They want the detonators,<br />or they're gonna kill me.</i>
5027068 5028403 John, didn't you hear me?
5030989 5032657 Yeah, I hear you.
5033074 5035118 John, get with the programme.
5035160 5037370 The police are here now.<br />It's their problem.
5037412 5039998 Tell these guys where the detonators are<br />so no-one else gets hurt!
5040040 5043251 I'm putting my life<br />on the line for you, pal!
5043293 5044794 <i>Ellis, listen to me carefully.</i>
5044836 5045920 John...
5045962 5048715 Shut up, Ellis!<br />Just shut your mouth!
5048757 5050133 Put Hans back on the line.
5050633 5054888 <i>Hans, this shithead doesn't know<br />what kind of man you are but I do.</i>
5054929 5056931 Good. Then you'll<br />give us what we want
5056973 5058183 and save your friend's life.
5058224 5060727 You're not part of this equation.
5060769 5063063 Hey, what am I, a method actor?
5063646 5064773 <i>Babe, put away the gun.</i>
5064814 5066608 <i>This is radio, not television.</i>
5066649 5068610 Hans, this asshole is not my friend!
5068651 5070236 I just met him tonight!<br />I don't know him!
5070278 5072364 Jesus Christ, Ellis!<br />These people will kill you!
5072405 5074282 Tell them you don't know me!
5075408 5077827 <i>How can you say that<br />after all these years?</i>
5078536 5081831 John? John?
5104938 5106314 Do you hear that?
5106940 5109359 Talk to me!<br />Where are my detonators?
5109859 5112654 Where are they,<br />or shall I shoot another one?
5112696 5113863 <i>Sooner or later</i>
5113905 5116366 <i>I might get to someone<br />you do care about.</i>
5117033 5119661 Go fuck yourself, Hans.
5120870 5122747 He just let the guy die.
5122789 5125333 He just gave him up.<br />Give me that headset.
5125375 5127293 That's like pulling the trigger yourself.
5127335 5131297 Can't you see what's happening?<br />Can't you read between the lines?
5131339 5133925 He did everything he could<br />to save him.
5134300 5136636 If he gave himself up,<br />they'd both be dead right now!
5136678 5139139 No way, man. They'd be talking to us.
5139180 5142851 You tell this partner of yours<br />to stay out of this from now on.
5142892 5146479 Because if he doesn't,<br />I'm really going to nail his ass.
5146521 5148148 The man is hurting.
5148189 5150025 He is alone, tired,
5150066 5153611 and he hasn't seen diddly-squat<br />from anybody here!
5153653 5156197 You're gonna tell me he'll give a damn
5156239 5159659 about what you do to him<br />if he makes it out of there alive?
5159701 5162245 Why don't you wake up<br />and smell what you're shoveling?
5162287 5164122 You listen to me, sergeant.
5164164 5167709 Any time you want to go home,<br />you consider yourself dismissed.
5167751 5171004 No, sir.<br />You couldn't drag me away.
5171338 5172881 <i>Attention, police.</i>
5174215 5176259 <i>Attention, police.</i>
5176593 5179429 -This is Sergeant Al Powell...<br />-Give me that.
5179763 5182057 This is Deputy Chief Dwayne Robinson.
5182098 5183224 Who is this?
5183266 5185060 This is Hans Gruber.
5186061 5189230 I assume you realize the futility<br />of direct action against me.
5189272 5191524 We have no wish<br />for further loss of life.
5191566 5194611 What is it you do wish for?
5195028 5198990 I have comrades in arms<br />around the world languishing in prison.
5199032 5202535 The American State Department<br />enjoys rattling its saber for its own ends.
5202577 5204621 Now it can rattle it for me.
5206289 5209918 The following people<br />are to be released from their captors.
5210543 5213630 In Northern Ireland the seven members<br />of the New Provo Front.
5214214 5218385 <i>In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders<br />of Liberté de Quebec.</i>
5218843 5222430 <i>In Sri Lanka, the nine members<br />of the Asian Dawn.</i>
5222472 5223973 What the fuck?
5224349 5225934 Asian Dawn?
5226476 5228978 I read about them in <i>Time </i>magazine.
5229354 5232857 When these revolutionary<br />brothers and sisters are free,
5232899 5236069 the hostages in this building<br />will be taken to the roof
5236111 5238113 and they will accompany us<br />in helicopters
5238154 5240615 to the Los Angeles<br />International Airport
5240657 5242701 where they will be given<br />further instructions.
5242742 5245036 You have two hours to comply.
5245954 5248790 Wait a minute. Uh, Mr. Gruber.<br />This is crazy.
5248832 5252627 I don't have the authority.<br />Two hours is not enough.
5252669 5255088 Hello? Hello!
5257090 5260260 Did you get all that?<br />We got to make some calls.
5260760 5262470 Do you think they'll even try?
5263013 5264723 Who cares?
5267392 5269144 Theo, are we on schedule?
5269185 5271229 One more to go, then it's up to you.
5271271 5274691 You better be right<br />because the last one will take a miracle.
5274941 5276317 It's Christmas, Theo.
5276359 5278987 It's the time of miracles,<br />so be of good cheer
5279029 5281823 and call me<br />when you hit the last lock.
5282532 5283616 Karl,
5283658 5287328 hunt that little shit down<br />and get those detonators.
5287746 5289581 Fritz is checking the explosives.
5289622 5292292 I'll check the explosives.<br />You just get the detonators.
5293209 5294711 Hey, Powell, you out there?
5296087 5297922 I'm here, John. I'm here.
5298548 5301509 You gotta believe me.<br />There was nothing I could do.
5302761 5305513 Well, it's gonna be<br />both our asses if you're wrong.
5305889 5307432 I hear you.
5313563 5315565 Did you catch that bullshit<br />Hans was running?
5316816 5318985 <i>It doesn't make sense, man.</i>
5319444 5320487 Hey, don't ask me, man.
5320528 5323531 I'm just a desk jockey<br />who was on my way home when you rang.
5324074 5327202 The way you drove that car<br />I figured you for the street, Al.

5339005 5340090 <i>Well, Gail,</i>
5340131 5342717 by this time,<br />the hostages should be going through
5342759 5345136 the early stages<br />of the Helsinki Syndrome.
5345178 5347013 As in Helsinki, Sweden.
5348014 5349057 Finland.
5349099 5352394 Basically, it's when the hostages<br />and the terrorists
5352435 5355146 go through a sort of<br />psychological transference
5355188 5357357 and a projection of dependency.
5357399 5360402 <i>A strange sort of trust<br />and bond develops.</i>
5360443 5362821 <i>We've had situations<br />where the hostages</i>

5373873 5375375 -Sir?<br />-Yeah?
5375417 5377377 Sir, the FBI is here.
5377419 5380797 -The FBI is here now?<br />-Yes, sir. Right over there.
5380839 5381965 Hold this.
5382549 5384467 Want a breath mint?
5388972 5391516 Hey, how you doing, man?
5391558 5394102 I'm Agent Johnson.<br />This is Special Agent Johnson.
5394144 5396604 -Oh, how you doing?<br />-No relation.
5397397 5398732 I'm, uh...
5400316 5403319 I'm Dwayne Robinson, LAPD.<br />I'm in charge here.
5404279 5405864 Not any more.
5460752 5464297 Hi, there. How you doing?
5467884 5468968 Ohh...
5470553 5473598 Please, God. No.<br />You're one of them, aren't you?
5473640 5475392 You're one of them.
5475433 5478353 No! Don't kill me! Please!
5478395 5480689 Don't kill me, please!<br />Please, please, please.
5480730 5483817 Whoa. Relax.<br />I'm not gonna hurt you.
5483858 5485735 I'm not gonna hurt you!
5488029 5489656 Oh, God.
5493076 5494869 What the fuck<br />are you doing up here?
5494911 5496371 What were you looking for?
5496413 5498832 I managed to get out of there and
5499582 5502043 I was just trying<br />to get up on the roof
5502085 5504838 and see if I could signal for help.
5506339 5508675 It's just over here.<br />Why don't you come and help?
5508717 5511845 Hold it. Forget the roof.
5512387 5515640 I said forget the roof.<br />They got people all over it.
5516599 5519269 You want to stay alive,<br />you stay with me.
5522272 5524024 The best we can figure it,
5524065 5527569 we've got maybe<br />30 or 35 hostages up there
5527610 5529320 probably on the 30th floor
5529362 5532991 and maybe seven or eight<br />terrorists up there.
5533366 5535577 Sounds like an A-7 scenario.
5535618 5537704 Thank you.<br />We'll handle it from here.
5537746 5540999 When we commandeer your men,<br />we'll try and let you know.
5541041 5543043 Aren't you forgetting something?
5543084 5544085 Such as?
5544127 5546087 What about John McClane?
5546129 5549049 He's the reason<br />we have any information.
5549591 5553261 He's also the reason<br />you're facing seven terrorists, not twelve.
5553303 5555221 He's inside? Who is he?
5555263 5558224 He might be a cop.<br />We're checking on that.
5558266 5560769 -One of yours?<br />-No, no way.
5566483 5567817 You smoke?
5568735 5569903 Yeah.
5575116 5576326 Thanks.
5580872 5583041 You don't work for Nakatomi.
5587170 5589506 And if you're not one of them...
5592342 5594260 I'm a cop from New York.
5595679 5597430 New York?
5597472 5598556 Yeah.
5599349 5602185 Got invited to<br />the Christmas party by mistake.
5602560 5603853 Who knew?
5612112 5615323 Better than being caught<br />with your pants down, huh?
5623540 5625166 I'm John McClane.
5626334 5627836 You're, uh...
5629212 5630338 Clay.
5632841 5634175 Bill Clay.
5640306 5642559 Know how to use a handgun, Bill?
5643685 5645854 I spent a weekend at a combat ranch.
5645895 5648148 That game with the guns<br />that shoot red paint.
5648481 5650734 Probably seems kind of stupid to you.
5652193 5653403 Nope.
5656197 5658408 Time for the real thing, Bill.
5666833 5669085 All you got to do<br />is pull the trigger.
5669544 5670754 Come on.
5689564 5691066 Put down the gun
5691608 5693777 and give me my detonators.
5698365 5699783 Well, well, well...
5701618 5702702 Hans.
5703745 5706289 Put it down now.
5709876 5712545 That's pretty tricky<br />with that accent.
5713505 5716466 You oughta be on fucking TV<br />with that accent.
5718968 5721805 But what do you want<br />with the detonators?
5722806 5725475 I already used all the explosives.
5727644 5728978 Or did I?
5730480 5732107 I'm going to count to three.
5732148 5734609 Yeah. Like you did with Takagi?
5735735 5736820 Oops.
5738321 5739698 No bullets.
5739739 5741491 What do you think...<br />I'm fucking stupid, Hans?
5742659 5743660 You were saying?
5798673 5799758 Karl.
5800258 5801968 Schieß dem Fenster.
5809142 5811061 Shoot the glass!
5844219 5845720 Jesus Christ!
5874958 5877919 Smile, Karl.<br />We're back in business.
5880588 5883591 <i>..is the last resort of diplomacy,</i>
5883633 5886761 <i>then couldn't we just as well say</i>
5886803 5889973 <i>that terrorism has an equal claim<br />on being that, too?</i>
5890432 5892726 Tell me you got something.

5896396 5898565 and his family's home address

5902485 5903528 Whoo!
5908575 5909743 Go to work.
5910285 5911619 Got it.
5924174 5927469 God, that man looks really pissed.
5929804 5931389 He's still alive.
5932182 5933183 What?
5934392 5937479 Only John can drive<br />somebody that crazy.
5954371 5956539 Hans, you better heat up that miracle
5956581 5958667 because we just broke through<br />on number six
5958708 5961461 and the electromagnetic<br />came down like a fucking anvil.
5962045 5966424 Have a look at what our friends<br />outside are doing and I'll be right up.
5969177 5970345 <i>Hey, John.</i>
5970762 5972806 <i>John McClane, you still with us?</i>
5972847 5973973 Yeah.
5974974 5978812 But all things being equal,<br />I'd rather be in Philadelphia.
5979396 5981523 Chalk up two more bad guys.
5982107 5984901 <i>The boys down here<br />will be glad to hear that.</i>
5985527 5987821 <i>We got a pool going on you.</i>
5987862 5989364 What kind of odds am I getting?
5989698 5991157 <i>You don't want to know.</i>
5991199 5992659 Put me down for 20.
5992701 5994244 I'm good for it.
5997664 6000333 <i>Hey, pal, you got flat feet?</i>
6002919 6005171 What the hell<br />are you talking about, man?
6005422 6007716 Something had<br />to get you off the street.
6007757 6008800 <i>What's the matter?</i>
6008842 6012262 <i>You don't think jockeying papers<br />across a desk is a noble effort for a cop?</i>
6014556 6015765 <i>No.</i>
6019144 6020562 I had an accident.
6020603 6022897 <i>The way you drive, I can see why.</i>
6023273 6024399 <i>What'd you do?</i>
6024441 6026651 Run over your captain's foot<br />with the car?
6030739 6031948 I shot a kid.
6033533 6035368 <i>He was 13 years old.</i>
6036619 6038705 <i>Oh, it was dark. I couldn't see him.</i>
6038747 6040623 <i>He had a ray gun, looked real enough.</i>
6043918 6047172 When you're a rookie, they teach you<br />everything about being a cop
6047213 6049090 except how to live with a mistake.
6053636 6057974 <i>Anyway, I just couldn't bring myself<br />to draw my gun on anybody again.</i>
6061478 6062812 <i>Sorry, man.</i>
6064314 6066983 Hey, man, how could you know?
6069319 6071154 I feel like shit anyway.
6074157 6075784 Well, then, this won't matter.
6076659 6080663 The LAPD is not calling the shots<br />down here any more.
6083083 6084250 The Feds?
6084793 6085835 You got it.
6087671 6090006 Those are the city engineers.
6091049 6092258 Wait.
6092509 6094427 They're going into the street circuits.
6095345 6097138 Those guys in the suits,<br />I don't know who they are.
6097180 6098390 That's the FBI.
6099808 6103103 They're ordering the others<br />to cut the building's power.
6103144 6105146 Regular as clockwork.
6106773 6108358 Or a time lock.
6108858 6110276 Precisely.
6110860 6114781 The circuits that cannot be cut<br />are cut automatically
6114823 6117617 in response to a terrorist incident.
6117659 6119828 You asked for miracles, Theo.
6119869 6123707 I give you the F-B-I.
6124124 6125917 I want the building shut down.
6125959 6128044 I got a problem. I got a switch...
6128086 6132424 I don't care<br />about your switch. I want it out. Dark!
6133341 6134926 You can't do it from here.
6134968 6137429 -Yeah, you could.<br />-It can't be done from here.
6137470 6138555 I could just... I got the radio...
6138596 6142767 You can't do it from here.<br />It's got to be done from downtown.
6142809 6144436 They've gotta take out<br />a whole city grid.
6144477 6146396 We're talking 10 square blocks.
6146438 6148398 Ten blocks? Johnson, that's crazy.
6148440 6150859 It's Christmas Eve.<br />There's thousands of people.
6150900 6152569 You have to go wider.
6152861 6154738 I need authorization.
6154779 6157532 How about the United States government?
6157991 6160076 Lose the grid, or you lose your job.
6166499 6168168 -Yeah, Central?<br /><i>-Yeah?</i>
6168209 6170712 This is Walt down at Nakatomi.
6170754 6175717 Would it be possible for you<br />to turn off grid 212?
6175759 6176968 <i>Are you crazy?</i>
6177010 6179179 Maybe I should call the Mayor.
6179220 6181681 No shit it's my ass.<br />I got a big problem here.
6181723 6184100 Shut it down now.
6188605 6190857 <i>Emergency lighting activated.</i>
6191441 6194319 Al, talk to me. What's going on here?
6194361 6195904 <i>Ask the FBI.</i>
6196488 6198740 They got the universal<br />terrorist playbook
6198782 6201242 and they're running it step by step.
6203370 6205288 It's gonna go. It's gonna go!
6207082 6208458 Yes!
6231314 6232816 Merry Christmas.
6235318 6237570 They must be pissing in their pants.
6237612 6239489 The Mayor is gonna have my ass.
6246496 6247831 Whoo!
6260802 6263680 What are we gonna do now?
6263722 6266433 Arrest them for not paying<br />their electric bill?
6266474 6268059 We've shut them down.
6268101 6271563 We let them sweat for a while,<br />then we give them helicopters.
6271604 6273815 Right up the ass.
6276359 6278153 This is Agent Johnson.
6278194 6279738 No, the other one.
6279779 6282824 I want that air support ready<br />to lift off in five minutes.
6282866 6285827 Damn right. Fully armed.<br />We're on the way.
6292709 6294669 Oh, yes!
6295879 6298298 I wish to talk to the FBI.
6300884 6303011 This is Special Agent Johnson.
6303845 6307140 <i>The State Department has arranged<br />for the return of your comrades.</i>
6307640 6310310 Helicopters are en route<br />as you requested.
6310352 6312354 <i>I hear you. We'll be ready.</i>
6312395 6315565 By the time he figures out<br />what hit him, he'll be in a body bag.
6315607 6317192 When they touch down,<br />we'll blow the roof.
6317233 6318943 They'll spend a month<br />sifting through the rubble.
6318985 6321654 By the time they figure out<br />what went wrong,
6321696 6324824 we'll be sitting on a beach earning 20%.
6330038 6331539 Ah! Jeez!
6331581 6332665 Powell?
6333500 6335335 Yo, Powell, you got a minute?
6337087 6338755 I'm here, John.
6340507 6343551 Listen, I'm starting to get<br />a bad feeling up here.
6344094 6346137 I want you to do something for me.
6346179 6347430 Um... ahem...
6348932 6350100 I want you to find my wife.
6350141 6352894 Don't ask me how.<br />By then you'll know how.
6352936 6356356 Uh, I want you<br />to tell her something.
6357774 6359901 I want you to tell her that...
6366574 6369244 Tell her it took me<br />a while to figure out
6369285 6371287 what a jerk I've been
6371955 6373248 but, um...
6374916 6375917 that...
6379796 6382549 that when things started<br />to pan out for her
6382590 6386761 I should have been more supportive.
6386803 6388054 And, uh...
6389305 6392267 <i>I just should have been<br />behind her more.</i>
6395145 6396438 Oh, shit.
6399149 6401234 Tell her that, um
6402569 6406489 that she's the best thing<br />that ever happened to a bum like me.
6408616 6412078 She's heard me say "I love you"<br />a thousand times.
6413496 6416916 She never heard me say I'm sorry.
6417292 6423506 I want you to tell her that, Al.<br />Tell her that John said that he was sorry.
6424841 6425925 OK?
6426843 6428011 You got that, man?
6428887 6430221 <i>Yeah, I got it, John.</i>
6431681 6433433 But you can tell her that yourself.
6434434 6438188 You just watch your ass<br />and you'll make it out. You hear me?
6438688 6441358 <i>I guess that's up to the man upstairs.</i>
6444694 6445862 <i>John?</i>
6446863 6448198 <i>John?</i>
6448823 6452369 What the fuck<br />were you doing upstairs, Hans?
6453995 6455080 <i>John?</i>
6455121 6458208 No, Al, listen.<br />Just lay off for a while.
6460210 6463004 I gotta go check on something.
6465757 6468343 One minute, that's all I'm asking.
6468385 6470053 One minute to speak to them.
6470095 6472430 All right. Get back. Get back.
6472472 6474849 All right, look.
6475308 6479479 You let me in right now,<br />or I call the INS, comprende?
6481690 6483566 This is the last time<br />these kids are gonna have
6483608 6485735 to speak to their parents.
6487654 6488780 All right?
6489364 6491199 All right. Come on. Come on.
6501584 6503503 What were you doing, Hans?
6503753 6505255 What were you doing?
6527610 6530780 Jesus, Mary, mother of God.
6534242 6536578 Al, listen to me!<br />It's a double-cross!
6536619 6538496 The roof is wired to...
6541624 6542625 <i>John?</i>
6545003 6546504 <i>John!</i>
6546796 6548131 John, come in!
6548715 6549841 Did you get that?
6549883 6551968 Something about a double-cross.
6553011 6555347 Tell me about it.
6560643 6562937 We are both professionals.
6565273 6566941 This is personal.
6568109 6569486 Aww...
6590715 6592884 They're coming!
6593468 6595220 Choppers are coming.
6595261 6598598 Time to gather your flock,<br />Miss Gennero.
6599557 6602560 <i>Your mom and dad<br />are very important people.</i>
6602602 6604562 <i>They're very brave people.</i>
6604979 6608900 <i>Is there something you'd like<br />to say to them, if they're watching?</i>
6609734 6611695 <i>Come home.</i>
6620620 6621955 Mrs McClane.
6625417 6628545 How nice to make your acquaintance.
6632048 6633800 On your feet, everyone! To the roof!
6633842 6636511 Lock them up there<br />and come right back.
6665415 6666958 You should have heard<br />your brother squeal
6667000 6669586 when I broke his fucking neck!
6673465 6675383 What do you figure the breakage?
6675425 6677677 I figure we take out the terrorists,
6677719 6681014 lose 20, 25% of the hostages, tops.
6681890 6683892 I can live with that.
6683933 6685935 Get this thing on the deck.
6685977 6689439 They're expecting transports,<br />not gun ships.
6701159 6703286 Move it! Come on! Move!
6703328 6704746 Come on! Come on!
6704788 6706039 Move it!
6706956 6708416 Go! Move!
6712295 6713463 Theo.
6713713 6715215 A little bonus for us.
6715256 6717384 Please, sit down. Sit down!
6718134 6720220 A policeman's wife<br />might come in handy.
6720261 6722764 McClane, I have some news for you.
6723932 6725225 McClane?
6736444 6737737 Move!
6740573 6741741 Come on!
6754004 6756297 Motherfucker! I'll kill you!
6760510 6761636 Armed.
6761928 6763972 -The truck?<br />-The truck.
6771312 6775066 After all your posturing,<br />all your little speeches,
6775108 6777610 you're nothing but a common thief.
6778153 6780280 I am an exceptional thief,<br />Mrs McClane.
6780321 6781906 And since I'm moving up<br />to kidnapping,
6781948 6783950 you should be more polite.
6790999 6793168 You motherfucker,<br />I'm gonna kill you!
6793209 6796755 I'm gonna fuckin' cook you,<br />and I'm gonna fuckin' eat you!
6819903 6821988 I don't like this, Sarge.
6829579 6835502 Yee-hah!<br />Just like fucking Saigon, eh, Slick?
6836920 6839798 I was in Junior High, dickhead.
6867951 6868993 Where's Holly?
6869035 6870578 Where's Holly Gennero?
6870620 6872580 Holly Gennero? Where's Holly?
6872622 6874499 Where's Holly? Where is she?
6874541 6876042 -They took her!<br />-Where?
6876084 6877085 The vault!
6877127 6879337 -Where is the vault?<br />-The 30th floor!
6879379 6881297 They just took her!
6882173 6883717 Get downstairs!
6884134 6885844 The whole fucking roof<br />is wired to blow!
6885885 6886928 Get down!
6886970 6889639 Get down!<br />Get the fuck downstairs!
6891766 6894686 They made us, Bureau.<br />Terrorist shooting hostages.
6894728 6896438 Break left!
6902986 6904654 Nail that sucker!
6913163 6915540 I'm on your side, you assholes!
6916458 6919586 Swing around again!<br />I'll bag this little bastard.
6938188 6940023 What the fuck...
6941441 6944319 Oh, John,<br />what the fuck are you doing?
6944986 6947864 How the fuck<br />did you get into this shit?
6958041 6961002 There's something wrong!<br />They're coming back down!
6961044 6963088 -Blow the roof.<br />-But Karl's up there!
6963129 6964547 Blow the roof!
6967717 6970637 I promise I will never even think
6970679 6973682 about going up<br />in a tall building again.
6977018 6979354 Oh, God, please don't let me die!
7070987 7073490 Holy Christ!
7074657 7077285 We're gonna need<br />some more FBI guys, I guess.
7090298 7092092 Jesus fucking Christ!
7092801 7093927 Fuck!
7118326 7120870 What the fuck is going on?
7123081 7126710 What are you gonna do?<br />Sit here while the building falls down?
7135218 7136219 Shit!
7136886 7138722 All right!
7138972 7140181 Hey! Hey!
7141349 7142976 Hang on, baby.
7143018 7144561 Hang on, honey.
7145645 7146688 Oh, God.
7192108 7193818 Hans!
7208458 7209793 Jesus.
7210585 7211961 Hi, honey.
7234526 7238655 So that's what this is all about?<br />A fucking robbery?
7238697 7240407 Put down the gun.
7241950 7244494 Why'd you have to nuke<br />the whole building, Hans?
7244536 7246955 Well, when you steal $600,<br />you can just disappear.
7246996 7250083 When you steal 600 million,<br />they will find you
7250125 7252794 unless they think<br />you're already dead.
7252836 7254963 Put down the gun.
7265515 7267183 Nein. This is mine.
7270228 7271896 You got me.
7271938 7274774 Still the cowboy, Mr McClane.
7274816 7276484 Americans... all alike.
7276526 7280905 This time, John Wayne does not walk off<br />into the sunset with Grace Kelly.
7280947 7282824 That was Gary Cooper, asshole.
7282866 7284325 Enough jokes.
7284659 7287287 You'd have made a pretty<br />good cowboy yourself, Hans.
7288038 7292042 Oh, yes. What was it<br />you said to me before?
7292959 7296713 Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
7317233 7318401 Holly!
7323740 7325241 Happy trails, Hans.
7330580 7332582 -Aah!<br />-Holly.
7370120 7371955 I hope that's not a hostage.
7400066 7404070 Gimme water hook-ups<br />for engine companies 5, 3, 9, 6.
7407991 7410285 Over here. It's a better angle.
7410326 7412245 Let's give them a hand.
7414497 7417584 Keep it going, now. Keep it going.
7422464 7426092 -Come on. We're going to miss it!<br />-OK. Hand me my notes!
7449199 7453286 What was it like in there?<br />How did they treat you?
7499290 7501084 Al, this is my wife Holly.
7501126 7503086 Holly Gennero.
7503586 7505380 Holly McClane.
7505422 7507132 Hello, Holly.
7507173 7509175 You got yourself a good man.
7509217 7511219 You take good care of him.
7511886 7513346 McClane!
7513805 7516182 McClane, I want a debriefing!
7516599 7519394 You got some things<br />to answer for, mister.
7519436 7521187 Ellis' murder, for one thing.
7521229 7524941 Property damage,<br />interfering with police business.
7565857 7568985 Two of you go inside<br />and see if there's anybody else!
7578828 7581414 No. This one's with me.
7591883 7593468 Mr McClane, Mr McClane!
7593510 7595845 Now that it's all over,<br />after this incredible ordeal,
7595887 7597847 what are your feelings?
7603228 7604312 Well, well, well.
7605522 7608525 -Merry Christmas, Argyle.<br />-Merry Christmas.
7612195 7613488 Did you get that?
7613530 7615532 Let me through.
7616366 7620370 If this is their idea of Christmas,<br />I gotta be here for New Year's.
7924007 7925008 English - US
