42167 43999 Well?
44169 47127 - I'm sending you the code.<br />- Yes, I see that. Thank you.
53553 56588 - What about my account?<br />- Delivering.
77452 79910 I just sent it. You should have it.
80121 83455 - Yes. Thank you.<br />- Are you sure this is legal?
83625 87084 We're just running a test<br />on our security system, sir. It's fine.
87253 90666 You have a sexy voice.<br />Is there anything else I can do for you?
90840 92706 - To you?<br />- We have all we need.
103603 104684 We're ready.
114030 117648 Yo, guess who just made<br />50 G's today.
124207 126323 - What'd you do to my drive?<br />- I didn't touch it.
126501 129414 This isn't cool.<br />Don't ever, ever touch my computer.
198114 201448 Diagnostics show no damage,<br />but this was an intentional breach.
201618 204451 - We were hacked?<br />- It wasn't Denial of Service level.
204621 207329 But they definitely<br />cracked our door.
207790 209701 Okay. Open the Black Hat files.
209876 213790 I want every hacker in the country<br />who could have done this interviewed now.
213963 217581 Sir, that's close to 1000 names.<br />This holiday weekend, we're short-staffed as it is.
217759 223050 Listen, we're supposed to keep this from<br />happening, and it happened to us. Get it done.
223223 225760 It's the middle of the night.<br />They're all over the country.
225934 227675 Fine. Get local law enforcement help.
227852 231720 Somebody out there thinks they can<br />screw with us. I wanna find out who.
257507 261296 - Jim. I said no.<br />- Lucy, you're killing me, all right?
261511 262751 - Get out.<br />- What?
262929 265045 - Get out of the car now.<br />- Don't touch me.
265223 267055 - No means no.<br />- What are you doing?
267225 270593 - John, stop it.<br />- Don't call me that. I hate it.
270853 273345 - You know this guy?<br />- Just shut your mouth right now.
273523 276185 Dad. Stop it. I mean it.
276359 279351 - Dad? You said your dad was dead.<br />- What?
280071 283154 You told this jerkoff I was dead?<br />You actually said that?
283324 286066 I may have exaggerated a little bit.
287287 289494 And this guy's what?<br />Your boyfriend?
289664 291780 - No.<br />- Yeah.
292458 295541 I don't know, okay?<br />I'm sorry. We'll see.
296796 298457 What are you doing here?
298631 302420 - You don't answer your phone, return calls.<br />- Because I'm not talking to you.
302593 307212 - Why aren't you talking to me this time, Lucy?<br />- Why not? What, you want a list?
307390 309677 How about stuff like, you spy on me.
309851 312058 - You drag my boyfriend out of the car.<br />- I'm not spying.
312228 314139 - You said he's not your boyfriend.<br />- He's not.
314314 317227 - I thought you said I just was.<br />- Shut up.
319277 321564 You are such an asshole.
322989 329235 Okay. I'm sorry I pulled your<br />not-boyfriend out of the car, okay?
331205 335073 - Lucy, baby, get in the car. Let's go.<br />- No, no.
335251 337538 - Will both of you go away?<br />- Just talk to me.
337712 340329 I'm tired. I'm going to bed.<br />Alone.
340506 342747 Damn right you're going to bed alone.
344761 348095 Lucy, honey, wait a minute.<br />I wanna talk to you. Just wait.
348264 351052 Dad, when I wanna talk to you...
351517 353474 If I wanna talk to you...
355271 357103 I'll call you.
357273 360436 Lucy. Wait, Lucy. Lucy.
360610 364353 - Lucy McClane.<br />- It's not McClane. It's Gennaro.
366866 368982 Chicks, right?
372455 374617 I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.
403069 405151 John?
405321 407688 John? It's Scalvino.
409450 413239 - Go for McClane.<br />- What are you doing at Rutgers?
413413 416781 - How do you know where I am?<br />- Our cars were LoJacked four years ago.
416958 421293 - I'm staring at exactly where you are.<br />- Sir, that's not something I would turn on.
421462 424580 Yeah, we did that.<br />John, we turned them on.
424757 427044 Listen, the feds have<br />called in a favor.
427218 431553 They're doing a sweep. They want us to<br />pick up some computer hacker in Camden.
431722 434760 Last name, Farrell.<br />First name, Matthew.
434934 437676 Camden?<br />What are you telling me this for?
437854 441188 - Just came in.<br />- It's 3 in the morning. I was on my way home.
441357 444270 Send a jughead from the academy.<br />They'd be happy to do it.
444444 448904 I can't just send in a uniform.<br />The feds demanded a senior detective.
449073 451440 The kid's a high-value subject.<br />I don't know.
451617 455201 Just pick him up, escort him<br />to the Hoover Building in D.C.
455371 459160 They had some kind of a computer breach<br />there this morning.
459417 461203 Great.
463754 465791 You owe me one, Jack.
465965 468377 All right, give me that name again.<br />What is it?
522355 523345 What?
533824 535781 Come on.
543042 544874 Goddamn it.
568234 572398 - Who is it?<br />- N.Y.P.D. Open the door, please.
578494 581657 - How you doing?<br />- N.Y.P.D? Okay.
581831 586541 Oh, I get it. Don't worry, everyone<br />gets lost around here. Glad to help. Take...
586711 589999 Hey, I'm not lost.<br />Are you Matthew Farrell?
590172 593790 No. He actually<br />does not live here anymore.
593968 597086 - Of course not. Who are you?<br />- My name is Daisy Duke.
597263 602679 Got a lot of shit for it when I was a kid.<br />Please don't add to it.
602852 606686 - Can I see some identification, please?<br />- Yeah, sure.
610026 615021 Detective. Yeah, that looks real.<br />You get that at Toys R Us? Looks great.
615197 619737 - Then of course...<br />- Yeah. That actually looks pretty good.
621203 625197 Farrell. Sully PDL-ed the new copy of<br />the Kill Zone Nine. Wanna check it out?
625374 629663 No. Thanks though, man. And good<br />luck at the Bad Timing Awards.
630504 632962 Open the door.
633132 634372 Shit.
640890 643222 Can I get you something?<br />Coffee? A warrant?
643392 646635 - What's this about?<br />- I don't know. Some computer thing.
646812 649645 D.C. feds wanna talk to you,<br />so let's go.
650232 653145 - Feds, huh?<br />- Yeah. The feds.
660951 665320 I've been White Hat for four years,<br />but once you're on that goddamn list.
665498 667205 Such a pain in the ass.
667375 669742 You play with dolls?
669919 672160 - Could you not touch that?<br />- Like a G.I. Joe?
672338 676206 No, it's not. It's a limited edition, and...
676384 679922 - That supposed to come off?<br />- No, but it's more valuable broken.
680096 683964 - So thanks for that.<br />- Krazy Glue. I'm sure it's very important.
684141 686303 I got some other cool shit<br />you can break.
686477 690266 - Let's go, okay? Come on.<br />- I gotta power down my gear, okay?
693025 696484 More dolls. Not spending<br />a whole lot of time with the girls, huh?
698781 700772 Hey! Are you really trying to escape?
702243 703859 - Jesus, don't shoot.<br />- Hey!
704036 705401 Get down.
711919 714206 - Jesus Christ.<br />- Keep your head down.
722805 725843 Oh, shit. Shit.
730730 731936 Go. Go.
732106 735770 Let's go. Come on.<br />Low, low. Stay down.
735943 737433 Come on.
746078 749161 It's all right.<br />Stay low, all right? Stay down.
749331 752619 - You stay with me, all right? Here we go.<br />- Okay.

774607 776518 Get down! Get inside! Get down!
780696 783484 They're back in the room.<br />They're back in the room.
787203 790366 Are you nuts?<br />Get out of here right now!
790539 792029 - I'm trying.<br />- Now!
794877 795867 Tony, take a right.
797922 798957 Come on, get in here.

882298 884289 Get ready to run.
918626 920492 What the hell was that?
922004 924871 - Did you do that?<br />- No.
925049 927962 - Shit.<br />- I didn't do that. Come on.
928135 932504 - Shit.<br />- Stay close. The whole apartment's on fire.
932890 934631 Holy shit.

984108 986349 - Kid, can you reload a gun?<br />- What? Me?
986527 988768 Can you reload a gun?
989863 993072 Open the glove box<br />and get a magazine out right now.
998205 1000071 Grab the gun and shoot this motherfucker.
1030529 1032691 Get your head down.
1035451 1037567 Jesus. Is the circus in town?
1047880 1050042 - Did you see that?<br />- Yeah, I saw it. I did it.
1052593 1057338 Camden base, 10077. Come back.<br />Camden base, 10077.
1057514 1058845 Camden base. Go ahead.
1059016 1062805 I need to speak to the chief of your detectives.<br />Police emergency, ASAP.
1062978 1064389 Stand by.
1064563 1068898 - This is Chief Detective Wiesman.<br />- This is Detective John McClane, N.Y.P.D.
1069068 1073403 Police emergency. I wanna report<br />a police shooting in your jurisdiction.
1093842 1096004 - Yeah?<br />- What's the status?
1102017 1103303 Wait one.
1124373 1127866 Thomas. We had a problem<br />in New Jersey. Farrell's still alive.
1131004 1133371 - So he got away.<br />- Yeah.
1133549 1135790 I did send five of you,<br />is that right?
1137719 1142555 I'm sending a chopper. Get airborne and<br />we'll track them down. Think you can handle that?
1147396 1149228 Oh, my God.
1150482 1151813 What the fuck?
1151984 1153019 Just breathe.
1153193 1156902 I am breathing. I can't stop shaking.
1157072 1159814 It's the adrenaline.<br />You're just scared. It'll pass.
1159992 1163860 Yeah, I'm scared.<br />Weren't you scared, back there?
1164037 1167155 Yeah. I was scared.
1167332 1171917 Really? This is you being scared?<br />I don't know, you seem really calm.
1172171 1174253 Have you done stuff like that before?
1174423 1178007 - Stuff like what?<br />- Like killing people.
1179803 1183262 Yeah. But not for a long time.
1184349 1187467 So who were those guys?<br />Why were they trying to kill you?
1187644 1189885 Why did they blow up<br />my goddamn apartment?
1191106 1192642 They were there to kill you.
1194276 1199271 - Why would they want to kill me?<br />- You tell me, kid. You're the criminal.
1214588 1218377 We got seven dead hackers so far,<br />none of whom were high on our list.
1218550 1221759 - Collect the hard drives, start sweeping them.<br />- Yes, sir.
1226725 1230059 Trey. Matthew Farrell.<br />Find him for me.
1230229 1231970 On it.
1234149 1236436 What's with all the guns?
1237027 1239189 Operational prudence.
1239863 1242150 Think of them as hardware<br />to your software.
1254586 1259331 Good morning, D.C. It's shaping up<br />to be a beautiful Fourth of July weekend.
1259508 1264253 If you've got any big plans, get started early,<br />because the traffic is ramping up.
1264429 1268093 So here's another golden oldie<br />for all the commuters out there.
1270227 1272844 What? What? What?
1273021 1275228 What are you doing? What is that?
1275399 1277310 - It's Creedence.<br />- Creedence?
1277484 1281523 Creedence. Creedence Clearwater<br />Revival? Classic rock?
1281697 1284860 I know who it is. It's old rock.<br />Doesn't make it classic.
1285033 1287946 - What sucked then, sucks now.<br />- You don't like Creedence?
1288120 1291238 This is like having a pine cone<br />shoved in my ass.
1291873 1295082 Okay. Really? That's mature.
1295252 1297118 Come on. I'm cooperating with you.
1299840 1303049 We're at a heading of 060.<br />Making another pass.
1306471 1309213 Listen up, everyone.<br />Are we ready?
1310058 1312971 Transportation hubs are prepped<br />and set.
1313145 1315136 Begin stage one.
1332581 1334242 What? Nothing.
1343342 1345754 With six and a half innings, the game...
1345927 1347918 Pavillion this weekend for two shows only...
1348096 1353808 When'd you last turn on the radio and listen<br />to popular music? Just give me a decade.
1353977 1358016 The '70s? I'm guessing.<br />Was Michael Jackson still black?
1358190 1361023 Pearl Jam.<br />I'll go back 10 years with you. Ten years.
1361193 1363059 Twenty years. The Cure? Nothing?
1363236 1368447 It's called news radio. Trying to see if your<br />friends from Camden made the headlines.
1368617 1370949 Hold on. You listen to the news?
1371119 1374032 You got a problem with the news now?
1374289 1377247 Yeah. I got a big goddamn problem<br />with the news.
1377417 1381001 Ready for this?<br />The news is completely manipulated.
1381171 1384289 Everything you hear, every single day...
1384466 1387709 is designed by corporate media to do<br />one thing only.
1387886 1389547 - Jesus.<br />- To keep you living in fear.
1389721 1391507 - Oh, fear?<br />- Total fear.
1391681 1395720 So you'll go out and spend money<br />on things you probably don't even need.
1395894 1398556 So advertisers can<br />keep buying ads on their stations.
1398730 1402689 I'll tell you one more thing. I'll do this<br />all day. I got days of data at home.
1402859 1404816 - I'll drop a bomb on you...<br />- Hey. Hey!
1404986 1406693 - What?<br />- Shut up.
1406905 1408236 Shut the fuck up.
1408407 1411775 That's good.<br />Be dismissive instead of...
1463503 1466086 - You all right?<br />- No, I'm not all right.
1466840 1469332 Just stay in the car.<br />You'll be all right.
1472095 1474177 Hey, man. Hey.
1475015 1477882 You all right? Don't move.<br />Just call 911, all right?
1478059 1479345 Okay.
1481396 1482852 Jesus Christ.
1504085 1506577 All the lights are green.
1506755 1509338 All the lights are green.<br />Let's go. Right now.
1509508 1512500 - We gotta go?<br />- Get your bag, hack-boy. Let's go.
1514596 1517429 - Let's go.<br />- This is crazy. I've never been in a car accident.
1517599 1519840 Well, it's very exciting.<br />This way, come on.
1520018 1521759 - You been in a car accident?<br />- Yeah.
1521937 1523052 What are we doing?
1523230 1527645 It's a little thing they invented in the '60s<br />called jogging. You're gonna love it.
1537202 1541196 Sir, Chicago's reporting<br />a systems crash on the L train network.
1545085 1548168 Amtrak is flashing a level-one crash<br />in their com system.
1548338 1552297 FAA just issued a critical alert.<br />Their ATC net just went down.
1555095 1557803 Okay, let's get them outside<br />for a little fresh air.
1569109 1571225 That's the anthrax alarm.
1573154 1576146 All right, everyone out. Now. Now.
1578827 1581819 Taylor, move. Go. Move.
1597137 1599629 All personnel must evacuate and proceed...
1599806 1601922 to the transportation shuttles immediately.
1602100 1604011 This is not a drill.
1604185 1609680 All personnel must evacuate and proceed<br />to the transportation shuttles immediately.
1629377 1630913 We need you inside, sir.
1637177 1641341 Take your team. I want men<br />on the fourth floor, got it? Masks on.
1644059 1645549 We gotta know what's there.
1645727 1649061 Run a trunk search on these data crashes,<br />see if we can ID the point of origin.
1652108 1654145 Begin stage two.
1660408 1661944 Hey, what's going on?
1669542 1672125 They're already starting to panic.
1675090 1677252 Of course they are.
1677425 1679883 They think that someone's<br />taking their money.
1681930 1683716 Prep the video package.
1696361 1701447 D.C. transportation system's crashing and<br />they just hit the financial sector. All of it.
1701616 1706281 Get me the secretary of trans and treasury<br />on the line and the chairman for the SEC.
1706454 1710823 Let's go, people. Somewhere<br />somebody left a digital fingerprint. Find it.
1711543 1714786 - Deputy Director Bowman in here?<br />- Not now. It'll have to wait.
1714963 1719002 Not today. This is Matthew Farrell.<br />I brought him here on orders from Bowman.
1719175 1722213 If you don't know what's going on,<br />find somebody that does.
1722387 1723468 I'm Bowman.
1729436 1731768 Video package is ready for upload.
1735692 1738024 John, I appreciate your bringing Farrell.
1738194 1741152 But we are neck-deep<br />in damage control right now.
1741322 1745316 Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir. Do you have<br />anything to eat, any snacks around?
1745493 1747985 I'd love...<br />I've got really low blood sugar.
1748163 1750325 - Sir?<br />- No?
1754043 1758958 As if the transportation breakdown<br />and anthrax scares weren't enough for one day...
1759132 1761840 the stock market<br />found itself in a selling frenzy.
1762010 1765423 The Federal Trade Commission believes<br />this panic might have been triggered...
1765597 1768555 by a computer malfunction<br />in the stock exchange.
1768725 1771467 Oh, man, that is all bad.
1771978 1775972 It's not as bad as it looks. We run drills<br />to prepare for things like this.
1776900 1778766 - These your suspects?<br />- Were.
1778943 1781526 All seven were killed<br />in the last 24 hours.
1783448 1785940 Recognize any of these people?
1787452 1788738 No.
1788912 1790619 Not one?
1790789 1793622 Sir, we got a system error.
1799672 1802004 My fellow Americans.<br />It is time to...
1802175 1805293 strike fear into<br />the hearts of citizenry.
1806304 1808762 - Ask not...<br />- That's an unauthorized broadcast.
1808932 1811845 What your country can do<br />to avert this crisis.
1812018 1814726 The answer is...<br />nothing whatsoever.
1814896 1818355 Our military strength<br />is in this case...
1818525 1819731 useless.
1820485 1823398 Read my lips.
1823863 1828778 The great confident roar<br />of American progress and growth...
1828952 1831569 has come to an end.
1831746 1835740 All the vital technology<br />that this nation holds dear.
1835917 1840002 All communications. Transportation.<br />The internet. Connectivity.
1840171 1843129 Electrical power.<br />Critical utilities.
1843842 1848052 Their fate now rests<br />in our hands.
1848221 1851680 We will not tire, we will not falter...
1851850 1853557 and we will not fail.
1853726 1856388 I don't know how they're getting in.
1856563 1857894 Thank you. And a...
1858064 1860226 happy Independence Day<br />to everyone.
1864028 1865769 That was creepy.
1865947 1867779 I tried to find more Nixon.
1868533 1870490 Think they bought it?
1870660 1872617 Absolutely.
1873913 1877076 Okay, I want telecom, transportation...
1877250 1879958 - Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.<br />- What?
1880795 1882627 It's a fire sale.
1882881 1883871 Hey.
1884132 1886544 - We don't know that yet.<br />- It's a myth anyway. Can't be done.
1886718 1891087 It's a myth? Really? Please tell me<br />she's actually not in charge of anything.
1891264 1893096 What's a fire sale?
1893266 1897635 It's a three-step systematic attack<br />on the entire national infrastructure.
1897812 1902101 Step one, take out transportation.<br />Step two, the financial base and telecoms.
1902275 1906109 Step three, get rid of all the utilities.<br />Gas, water, electric, nuclear.
1906279 1910648 Anything that's run by computers,<br />which today is almost everything.
1910825 1913817 That's why they call it a fire sale,<br />because everything must go.
1913995 1916407 Listen. What's your name? Farrell?
1916581 1920666 Keep your voice down, okay?<br />No one here's talking about a fire sale.
1920835 1924749 Not unless you're telling me<br />you helped plan one.
1924923 1927210 What? No, man. I'm just saying...
1927383 1929966 Appreciate your concern.<br />We're on it. Thank you.
1930136 1932969 - You've done a bang-up job so far.<br />- What? What?
1933139 1935346 Nothing. I said I understand.
1935892 1942389 Hey, they didn't send the girl scouts to get this kid.<br />They sent professionals, full tactical gear.
1942565 1948186 They blew the joint up. I don't know this kid,<br />and frankly I don't give a shit. No offense.
1948363 1950525 But somebody wants this kid dead...
1950698 1954817 and obviously it's got something to do<br />with whatever's going on here.
1954994 1958362 Okay. Homeland's interrogating<br />the hackers we're bringing in.
1958539 1961372 I'll get you an escort over there. All right?
1961542 1966833 Molina, get this kid to the front of the line.<br />I wanna know what he knows.
1967006 1969964 If he knew half the shit I know,<br />his head would explode.
1970718 1973050 Special Agent Johnson.<br />We'll take the sedan.
1973221 1976714 - Agent Johnson?<br />- That's right. Right this way.
1976891 1981385 Great. So is any of that actually possible,<br />what you were saying back there?
1981562 1985977 Is it possible? Look, you take out<br />any one thing, the system can recover.
1986150 1991486 If you take it all down at once, the system<br />crashes and... Look around, man.
1991656 1996241 Come on. Government's gotta have dozens<br />of departments dedicated to that shit.
1996411 2000575 It took FEMA five days<br />to get water to the Superdome.
2023688 2026271 How long till we get to DHS?
2026441 2031151 Laughlin, get on the D.C. police band<br />and get them to clear a route to DHS for us.
2031320 2034278 D.C. Metro, this is the FBI<br />requesting you to clear a route...
2038161 2040277 Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.
2041205 2043412 - Feds are taking him to Homeland.<br />- Good.
2043583 2046291 - Close that loop, now.<br />- Isolate the frequency.
2046461 2050830 Get us a location on the vehicles<br />and pull me up a file on this John McClane.
2051007 2054125 Rand, we just found Farrell.<br />Stand by for a location.
2058306 2062265 I don't mean to harp, but we just passed<br />another Arby's, and I'm starving.
2062435 2064517 - I could eat a wrapper.<br />- Shut up.
2064687 2067805 - I could just get some ketchup packets.<br />- Shut up.
2067982 2070644 You got about 14 minutes<br />to tell me why you lied to me.
2070818 2073150 Lied to you? What are you talking about?
2073321 2075562 The pictures on the wall.<br />You knew those guys.
2075740 2078323 - I don't...<br />- Kid, don't lie to me.
2078493 2081611 I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.<br />Who were they?
2084499 2087116 Okay, okay. Okay.
2089504 2092496 They were my competition.
2094967 2097425 Make the next right onto Concord.
2097595 2100838 They said they'd developed<br />a mutating encryption algorithm...
2101015 2103347 and they wanted to see<br />if it could be cracked.
2103518 2106852 That's what I do.<br />I do math-based security.
2111275 2115860 Here's the thing. To pull off something<br />as massive and crazy as a fire sale...
2116030 2120024 you need tons of guys to write programs,<br />but only a few Black Hats to implement it.
2120201 2124741 At that point, the start-up guys who haven't<br />really done anything wrong, like me...
2124914 2127326 Would end up as pictures<br />on some guy's wall.
2127500 2132870 I swear to God, McClane, I swear to you<br />I had no idea I was gonna be...
2133381 2135873 an accessory to Armageddon.
2136551 2138462 Take the next left at Lexington.
2138636 2142721 And that's a sexy voice.<br />What's she taking us this way for?
2142890 2144472 - Unit 510.<br />- Oh, my God.
2144642 2147680 Clear a route for two FBI vehicles<br />approaching on Concord.
2147854 2149060 Copy, dispatch.
2149230 2150561 That's her.
2150731 2152768 - Her who?<br />- What are you talking about?
2154902 2157189 - It's them.<br />- You're saying it's them them?
2157363 2161152 I swear to you I know her.<br />I would know her voice anywhere.
2162326 2165409 - Don't say anything.<br />- Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.
2166914 2169406 Hey, Metro, how's your day<br />going over there?
2169584 2173919 Gotta be pretty crazy over there,<br />what with all those 587s.
2174088 2176079 Yes, sir.<br />We've had to dispatch all units.
2178259 2182253 You had to dispatch all units<br />for all the naked people walking around?
2182430 2185798 Cut the bullshit, honey,<br />and just put your boss on.
2188227 2191345 Laughlin, we're getting off this route.<br />Turn left on 14th Street.
2200281 2204240 - Officer McClane.<br />- It's Detective McClane, asshole.
2204410 2209530 Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time to get<br />to know each other when I visit you in prison.
2209707 2212950 But, John, I already know<br />so much about you.
2213127 2215209 Your address in Brooklyn.
2215379 2219919 The payments on your mortgage, how long<br />you've been a member of the N.Y.P.D.
2220092 2221753 And how's Holly?
2221928 2226092 That's sad. You're divorced.<br />Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?
2228142 2234184 Now, this is sad. After 30 years I thought<br />you'd have a better pension plan annuity.
2234357 2236314 And it gets worse.
2238778 2241736 Your 401k no longer exists.
2241906 2246275 - Tell you what. Let me make it up to you.<br />- Box them in at that intersection.
2246452 2249490 Shoot Mr. Farrell in the head<br />and drive away...
2249664 2252247 and by the time you reach<br />the end of the next block...
2252416 2257911 all your debts will be wiped clean<br />and your children will be set for life.
2258089 2261582 Now, that really is tempting,<br />especially that last part.
2261759 2264217 But I think I'm gonna have to pass,<br />jerkoff.
2265972 2268259 John, you're gonna lose.
2269016 2272759 Yeah, well, the other thing that could<br />happen is I could come and find you...
2272937 2276475 kick your ass and throw you out of<br />your own party. How's that sound, fuckhead?
2277692 2278853 Hold your position.
2285032 2286989 Get your head down! Kid, get down!
2292999 2294660 Just stay down.
2298587 2302205 Officers down at the corner of<br />Main and Constitution. Officers down.
2320318 2322559 Come on, come on, get out. Let's go.
2325906 2328989 - Goddamn it. Just stay down.<br />- What was that?
2334582 2336823 Get down! Just hang on.
2347053 2350921 Base, we've got a squad car<br />under fire. We need backup.
2351098 2353590 This is base.<br />We're sending backup.
2358230 2360141 Just brace yourself.
2375748 2377489 Hang on. Hang on.
2393641 2395177 Hang on.
2404985 2406475 Yeah!
2411617 2413403 - We lost Del.<br />- Stay with them.
2424213 2425874 - They're back.<br />- I know.
2429135 2430671 Take the tunnel. Left!
2437017 2438678 God, what are you...?<br />Oh, God.
2447611 2449693 Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.
2449864 2451320 The tunnel!
2460875 2462866 Open the gates on the north side entrance.
2470509 2472420 Redirect traffic to occupy all lanes.
2489570 2492278 - Now open the other side.<br />- What?
2492448 2493688 Move.
2497995 2499281 Hang onto something.
2536325 2539613 Hey! Don't get out of the car.<br />Hey! Don't...
2546293 2547283 Run, goddamn it, run!
2548128 2549789 Down! Get down!
2558806 2560968 Run. Run!
2568148 2569138 - Fuck.<br />- Oh, God.
2574822 2576483 Don't hesitate like that again.
2576657 2578398 Can you help me get my wife...
2578576 2580988 - You all right?<br />- Yeah, yeah.
2581161 2583869 - You okay?<br />- I can't move my arms.
2585291 2588374 - Just stay here. Stay right here for a minute.<br />- What?
2588544 2591161 It can't be a uniform, John. No.
2592006 2595089 Get over to the wall, sir.<br />Feds called in a favor.
2595259 2601050 All you gotta do is go pick up a kid<br />down in Jersey, drive him down to D.C.
2601223 2604636 How hard can that be, huh?<br />It can't be that hard, can it?
2606020 2608432 No, gotta be a senior detective.
2613861 2618071 Think a traffic jam, throwing a car<br />at me is gonna stop me?
2618240 2620322 Rand, get in there and get it done.
2633547 2636710 Okay, the car's on fire.
2637176 2639087 That can't be good.
2639678 2642136 Oh, this is a bad fucking idea.
2680427 2683169 - Don't touch me, don't touch me.<br />- Okay, sorry, sorry.
2683347 2685588 Are you okay? Oh, my God.
2688352 2692061 - Pretty lucky shot, huh?<br />- Yeah, lucky. That was...
2692231 2694347 You just killed a helicopter with a car.
2694566 2699276 Hundreds of thousands of people get killed<br />by cars every year. It's just like four more.
2702282 2706276 - How you doing?<br />- I skinned my knee, my asthma's acting up...
2708330 2713120 - Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.<br />- I'm an idiot. I'm too old to jump out of cars.
2722886 2725002 Rand, check in.
2727599 2729931 What about Farrell and McClane?
2732730 2733811 Come back in.
2733981 2736063 We're moving on. Begin stage three.
2736233 2739601 I just spoke to Emerson.<br />The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.
2739778 2743988 Very good. Mai, get ready for the downloads.
2750998 2752955 ID, sir.
2753542 2755829 Park behind the transpo.<br />We'll lead you in.
2756003 2758335 Man the gate. You're with me.
2765053 2768011 Anthrax alarms<br />only went off on five floors.
2768182 2771015 Below that you'll need<br />DOD clearance.
2771185 2775304 I don't know why you'd need to go further.<br />There's nothing down there but servers.
2781111 2784854 Go again. Rodriguez. I didn't copy.
2800297 2801958 - Gate secured.<br />- Copy.
2811725 2812715 Okay, we are in.
2847636 2848842 This is insane.
2849012 2851925 Hey. Hey. This is absurd.
2852099 2857310 Man, there's tough and there's stupid.<br />You gotta go to a hospital. Look at you.
2857938 2859929 I'm not a doctor, but you're hurt.
2860107 2862018 - Yeah. Sexy, right?<br />- No.
2862192 2863353 Come on.
2863610 2866068 We don't need a doctor.<br />We need the cops.
2894516 2896132 He's in.
2896977 2899719 Get out of the way.<br />Make a hole, please. Come on.
2899897 2904357 Watch out. Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />Come on.
2904526 2907484 N.Y.P.D. All right? I got this kid.<br />Come on. Let's go, kid.
2913118 2914825 It's okay. Yeah. Thanks.
2914995 2916781 N.Y.P.D.
2917497 2919488 Coming through.
2919666 2920781 Sergeant?
2920959 2923872 Sergeant. I need to speak to you.
2924046 2928882 - The medic's in the back.<br />- I'm all right. N.Y.P.D. I need to talk to you.
2929051 2931338 Just give me a minute.
2931511 2933718 Sergeant.
2937309 2939220 Oh, my God.
2945233 2947315 Let's get out of here.
2954159 2955775 Open. Open, open.
2961458 2962914 We're a go.
2963085 2964120 Launch the downloads.
2975138 2977880 - Nothing's happening.<br />- Be patient.
2982145 2983351 Wait for it.
2988527 2990859 See? There you go.
2992406 2994693 Let me know when the download<br />reaches 20 percent.
2994866 2996356 Okay.
2997953 2999990 I need you to please<br />remain calm.
3002749 3003910 Excuse me.
3005877 3009996 - Excuse me. Thank you.<br />- Holy shit.
3010173 3012335 - Kid? Kid, hey.<br />- Yeah, yeah.
3012509 3014967 - You got a phone in that bag?<br />- Yeah.
3015137 3017094 Come on. Let's go.
3020350 3024765 And here you go, Agent Tovarek.<br />Guess that's you.
3046585 3049623 - Download's at 20 percent.<br />- Time to move.
3049796 3052834 Let's keep them chasing<br />their tails.
3067773 3069639 Due to recent activity...
3069816 3072649 law enforcement agencies<br />are being cautious.
3072819 3077188 They are telling drivers to abandon<br />their vehicles until they are searched.
3077365 3081324 And, as you can see,<br />canine units are checking each vehicle.
3081536 3084904 Whether this is connected to<br />the anthrax reports we heard earlier...
3085082 3087369 or a new terrorist threat, we do not know.
3087542 3089874 - FAA just grounded all flights.<br />- Good.
3090045 3095506 We have complete access over networks.<br />Phones, power grids, water, nuclear.
3095675 3097757 - Excuse me.<br />- Jack Parry, NSA.
3097928 3101637 Chuck Summer, DHS liaison.<br />White House made the call.
3101807 3105641 - Anything you need, we're here to help.<br />- Help? Wow, that's great.
3105811 3110476 We're gonna need some work space<br />for our people. What can you do for us?
3110649 3115815 As you can see, we're using the space, so<br />you guys can stand in the corner and liaise.
3115987 3119105 If I need something,<br />I'll just wave to you.
3141721 3144554 - Wait. No, don't call.<br />- What are you talking about?
3144724 3148342 They probably cracked that hours ago.<br />They could trace us. Put it in your pocket.
3148562 3150269 - You sure?<br />- Yes.
3150438 3153021 Or smash it.<br />You didn't have to smash it.
3153775 3156392 - Excuse me. It's a police emergency.<br />- Hey. Hey!
3156570 3158060 He'll call you right back.
3159739 3161229 Here, right in here.<br />Come here.
3162576 3164317 - You got a signal?<br />- Yeah.
3165912 3169075 - Yeah.<br />- This is John McClane for Agent Bowman.
3169249 3171536 Sir, John McClane is on the line.
3172794 3175001 - McClane, go.<br />- We never made it to DHS.
3175172 3177880 They came after the kid again.<br />All your men are down.
3180594 3183427 - What about Farrell?<br />- I got him with me right now.
3183597 3185554 - Sir?<br />- Hang on, John.
3185724 3187385 Yeah, I'll hold on.
3192355 3194767 Another day in paradise.
3194941 3200027 They just swarmed at everything.<br />The telecom system, phones, cells, satellites.
3212542 3214624 They're blanketing every station.
3241488 3245527 - Can you put the news back on?<br />- This is the news. It's on every channel.
3245700 3248488 Been this way for a few minutes now.
3265178 3267010 Oh, my God.
3275021 3276637 McClane.
3277691 3278726 Look out!
3278942 3280478 Look out!
3281695 3283185 Look out.
3284864 3286980 Bowman?<br />Bowman, do you see that?
3287158 3289320 Bowman, it's a fake.
3293581 3295163 I see it.
3296167 3298078 Thank God.
3299546 3301378 Oh, shit.
3301548 3303380 - McClane?<br />- Bowman.
3309055 3311296 Satellite's down. Get me a land line.
3313143 3314508 Shit.
3326740 3332110 I wrote one little piece of code and the<br />world falls apart. This is virtual terrorism.
3332287 3334324 - What?<br />- You know, it's crazy.
3334497 3337114 The first time I heard of the concept<br />of a fire sale...
3337292 3340501 I actually thought it would be cool<br />if anyone ever really did it.
3341379 3347045 Just hit the reset button<br />and melt the system just for fun.
3347218 3350586 Hey. It's not a system. It's a country.
3350764 3353927 You're talking about people,<br />a whole country full of people.
3354100 3357593 Sitting at home alone, scared to death<br />in their houses, all right?
3357771 3363107 So finish your nostalgic moment and think<br />a little bit and help me catch these guys.
3364110 3367978 Just help me.<br />Just put yourself in their shoes.
3369157 3372900 Come on. If this were your fire sale,<br />what would be your next move?
3373078 3378790 Okay... Well, the whole point of a fire sale<br />is that it's mostly done by remote, right?
3378958 3383873 But not everything is run completely online.<br />Major utilities aren't.
3384047 3387790 They're run by closed circuits,<br />so you could breach the security to a point...
3387967 3391926 but to shut it down you'd have to<br />physically go there. You'd have to show up.
3392097 3393132 And...
3394974 3397466 - Give me that guy's PDA.<br />- Phones are all dead.
3397644 3403139 No, it's the network that's dead. I've just gotta<br />reprogram it and link it into the old Satcoms.
3403316 3407810 Hackers surf them all the time. Probably what<br />these guys are using to talk to each other.
3407987 3409648 How do you know all this stuff?
3409823 3414067 Dude, I don't know. There's a lot<br />rattling around up there. I couldn't tell you.
3414244 3416861 Okay. National power grid.
3417038 3420531 Gas and electric is divided into three zones.<br />Eastern, Central, Western.
3420708 3423166 Each with a primary hub.
3423336 3425327 Here it is.
3426548 3429290 - What are we looking at?<br />- That is the Eastern hub.
3429467 3434883 Now, they take this out, wipes out all<br />the power for the entire Eastern corridor.
3435056 3437423 But, again, you'd have to do it manually.
3437600 3442515 - Okay. Come on. Let's go.<br />- What? To West Virginia?
3442689 3446808 I honestly don't think I can handle<br />any more people trying to kill me. McClane.
3446985 3448100 McClane. Aw, shit.
3448570 3453110 Sir, wireless networks are down<br />and I think they're hitting the land lines too.
3453283 3456321 I don't care how,<br />you find me a line.
3456494 3459532 - Come on, what you got?<br />- We swept the building. Seems clean.
3459706 3464291 - We can sweep it again.<br />- Don't bother. Don't bother.
3464461 3467704 It's a fake. This guy's playing us.
3467881 3470373 Okay, get everyone back inside<br />the crisis center now.
3470550 3472211 Okay, let's open it up.
3475096 3477679 - Come on, get in.<br />- Door's locked.
3478641 3481383 Unless you have an extra gun<br />I can use to unlock it.
3483813 3486851 Don't do that.<br />You're gonna disable it.
3488318 3489649 Fuck!
3491154 3493065 That was crazy. Did you see that?
3493239 3496231 Sorry about that, man.<br />I didn't know it'd come out so fast.
3496409 3497865 Fucking idiot.
3498661 3502029 Man, this is a pain in the ass.<br />How'd you do yours?
3505335 3508293 You all right? What?<br />Did it hit you a little bit?
3508463 3510374 Sorry.
3513343 3517632 No, please don't touch those, okay?<br />I know what I'm doing. I've done this before.
3517805 3519762 I mean, I've read about it.
3521392 3523599 Road Assist.<br />We've detected an airbag deployment.
3523770 3528264 Yes. Please, we just hit a tree<br />and my dad is having a heart attack.
3528441 3530808 I think he's gonna die. You need to help us.
3530985 3533693 Hold while we contact emergency services.
3533863 3538858 No, no. He's dying. I can get him<br />to a hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.
3539035 3543950 But I can't really turn the key, so you gotta<br />start the car for us, okay? Please, Dad...
3544123 3546740 - Your name, please?<br />- I'm...
3547460 3550623 My name is... Frank.
3550797 3554415 And my dad's name is...
3556844 3560087 Dvorak Tsajanski.
3561391 3564634 Please, just help us.<br />We need your help. Please.
3565395 3567511 Emergency services are on their way.
3567689 3570351 No, no, listen to me.<br />Ma'am, what is your name?
3570525 3572141 - Dolores.<br />- Dolores?
3572318 3575527 Okay, Dolores, I don't know<br />if you have a dad, but I do.
3575697 3577938 And I wanna be able to say that<br />a year from now.
3578116 3582030 Because my dad is my hero,<br />and right now he is in my arms dying...
3582203 3586322 and his only hope is to get to a hospital<br />right now. We can't wait.
3586499 3588831 So please start the goddamn car!
3593298 3595039 Thank you, Dolores.
3595216 3597583 Pass the PDA.<br />I gotta call the Warlock.
3597760 3601253 - The what?<br />- The Warlock. A digital Jedi. He's amazing.
3619073 3622816 - Ma'am, you're not authorized to be here.<br />- FBI. We suspect a security breach.
3622994 3624359 You can't land here without...
3645266 3647507 That was pretty good back there, kid.
3648144 3649600 Thanks.
3650188 3653397 What's the matter with you?<br />Nothing else to complain about?
3653566 3655978 No. I'm just...
3656152 3660737 - Well, what? What's the matter?<br />- I'm not like you. I can't do this shit.
3660907 3662739 What's that mean? Like what?
3663576 3668241 I'm not, like, heroic and everything.<br />I'm not brave like you are.
3668414 3670325 I'm nobody's hero, kid.
3670500 3672992 You've saved my life, like,<br />ten times in six hours.
3673169 3675752 Just doing my job, that's all.
3675922 3677253 Fuck being a hero.
3677840 3682676 Know what you get for being a hero?<br />Nothing. You get shot at.
3682845 3686839 You get a little pat on the back,<br />blah-blah-blah. Attaboy.
3689519 3690725 You get divorced.
3691938 3694930 A wife that can't remember<br />your last name.
3695108 3697440 Your kids don't wanna talk to you.
3698778 3701440 You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.
3702031 3704363 Trust me, kid,<br />nobody wants to be that guy.
3706160 3710074 - Then why are you doing this?<br />- Because there's nobody else to do it now.
3710248 3713240 If there was somebody else to do it,<br />I would let them do it.
3713418 3716080 But there's not. So we're doing it.
3718256 3720418 And that's what makes you that guy.
3729434 3731345 Thing is flying now.
3731519 3734307 Contact Emerson.<br />Tell him we'll be there soon.
3741112 3743524 What the hell are you doing?<br />This whole floor's restricted...
3770516 3771597 Stay here.
3801881 3803337 All right, come on.
3822527 3824734 - We're in.<br />- Good. Shut it down.
3835915 3838122 Guess you were right, kid.
3838292 3840704 Okay, that's awful.
3843256 3844997 We got company.
3853891 3856258 - How would they shut down a power grid?<br />- What?
3856435 3860394 - Come on.<br />- Central control room. Okay.
3862066 3865184 - Fourth floor. Fourth floor.<br />- Come on.
3867613 3869445 Take the right.
3876330 3877946 Shit.
3879125 3881162 - Can we stop for...<br />- Try to keep up.
3881335 3884123 I am. I just wanna stop<br />for two seconds to catch our breath.
3884297 3887415 You know, they have these things<br />called gymnasiums.
3909071 3911654 Come on, let's go. Let's go.
3923920 3926628 Intel's fairly certain<br />the terrorists are mobile.
3926797 3929585 It's the only way<br />to avoid signal triangulation.
3929759 3932091 With the amount of hardware<br />they're running...
3932261 3936846 we're probably looking for a large vehicle,<br />most likely a semitrailer rig.
3937016 3939633 All right.<br />Tell the guys at Homeland Security...
3939810 3943599 we need every agent, satellite<br />and functioning network they got. Now.
3963042 3964703 Play time's over, sweetheart.
3964877 3965958 Don't.
3966128 3968495 Take your hand off the gun.<br />Hands up.
3969382 3970497 Stand up.
3977264 3978550 Go on. Now.
3980059 3982721 Let's go, kid. You're up.
3982895 3984556 Okay.
3986190 3987351 As fast as you can.
3987525 3988640 Hey! Hey!
3990736 3992318 Jesus.
4008713 4010750 That's enough of this kung fu shit.
4010923 4015258 I've known some bitches in my day,<br />but you are maybe...
4019849 4022386 Still awake, huh?
4022560 4024722 - Just keep doing what you're doing.<br />- Okay.
4024895 4027307 - How much time do you need?<br />- Not much.
4040786 4043323 Are you done?
4043497 4045283 - Are you done?<br />- No, not quite.
4045458 4048371 - What?<br />- I'm not exactly checking my e-mail here.
4049795 4053208 They used VM mode, so I'm isolating<br />their API and booting the host.
4053382 4056625 - What?<br />- It means about 30 seconds, okay?
4056802 4059134 - Not the easiest thing to do when...<br />- What the...?
4059805 4061011 Fuck, bitch!
4064393 4065633 Fuck.
4071942 4073649 Okay.
4074487 4076694 Undo everything you just did. Now!
4076864 4079026 Okay. Okay. Okay.
4079784 4083994 I'm a righty, I'm a righty.<br />I need my other hand, I really do.
4084914 4086325 I'm a righty.
4119782 4121819 One last door to open.
4122785 4126699 Do you know what you're doing? Do you<br />realize what this'll do to the country?
4126872 4130866 Yes, I do. Now open the door.
4131043 4134456 Okay, good. Glad we're on the same page.
4141011 4143799 You do? I'm glad you know.
4159738 4161729 How you doing?
4170749 4172331 Hang on.
4245658 4248650 Listen, let's just talk<br />about this for one second.
4253332 4256324 How you doing?<br />That's not too tight, is it?
4259338 4260703 Damn it.
4263342 4264503 Smile pretty.
4281151 4282266 Fuck.
4283195 4284481 Motherfucker!
4299128 4300209 McClane.
4302548 4304255 Shit.
4304967 4307208 McClane, get out of there!
4308721 4310928 Come on, man! Come on!
4314393 4315474 Come on, man!
4330200 4332487 Fuck you, bitch.
4337249 4338831 Did you see that?
4342838 4344795 So you stopped it, right?
4344965 4348253 You know, a gun to your head<br />makes it harder to do this kind of work.
4348427 4351294 - What?<br />- I know that comes as a surprise.
4354725 4358093 - Can't you just turn it off? Lock them out?<br />- I'm not sure.
4360439 4363227 I might be able to slow them down though.
4365069 4368812 Western and Central hubs are ours.<br />We're just waiting on Mai's end.
4369490 4373074 Hang on. Something's up.<br />All the security's reactivating.
4374286 4379281 I think someone might be in the market<br />for some cheap Viagra.
4379458 4384168 Now your girlfriend's dead,<br />why don't you check out our sexy singles.
4384963 4386704 It's an e-bomb.
4393806 4395137 Hey, hey.
4399061 4400472 All right, wait, wait.
4404316 4406899 - Mai, talk to me. What's going on?<br />- Mai.
4407820 4411814 Oh, yeah, little Asian chick,<br />likes to kick people?
4411990 4414982 I don't think she's gonna be talking<br />to anybody for a really long time.
4415994 4421285 Last time I saw her, she was at the bottom<br />of an elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.
4422251 4425243 What's the matter?<br />Cat got your tongue?
4425421 4428834 Listen, jackass. Your fire sale is over.
4430801 4435170 Just pack up your little circus or I'm gonna<br />come and I'm gonna kick your ass.
4435347 4441389 You have no idea who I am<br />or what I'm capable of.
4441562 4444145 When I'm finished here,<br />and I promise it'll be soon...
4444314 4447978 I will focus all my attention on you.
4449361 4452149 You wanna make things personal, fine.
4472217 4476552 Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas<br />in the pipelines to that station.
4478265 4482850 - Can you get Bowman on this thing?<br />- Sure. I can get anyone on it.
4483020 4484101 Do it.
4484271 4486012 - Now?<br />- Yeah, now.
4489735 4491726 Please, no.
4492696 4494528 - It's Thomas Gabriel.<br />- Shit.
4496325 4499568 - You know this guy?<br />- I worked with him.
4499745 4503204 He was DOD's chief programmer<br />for infrastructure security.
4503373 4507241 After 9/11, he's the guy that told<br />Joint Chiefs the system was vulnerable.
4507419 4511538 He wanted an overhaul, but they wouldn't<br />listen. Gabriel's not people-friendly.
4511715 4513205 You think so?
4513383 4516546 When he tried to go public,<br />they crucified him.
4516720 4520805 Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.<br />After that he disappeared.
4520974 4523261 We got a pretty serious problem.
4523435 4525597 Hold on one minute.<br />What?
4525771 4528354 I think we need<br />to get out of here right now.
4529858 4532816 - They're sending the gas lines here.<br />- Gas lines? What gas lines?
4533445 4534480 Christ.
4537074 4540283 All of them. See that,<br />those flashing arrows? That's not good.
4540452 4543911 - All that's coming here?<br />- Yeah. I think we gotta go.
4544081 4547415 Listen, I gotta go.<br />Just find Thomas Gabriel.
4547584 4549916 McClane? McClane?
4550087 4551373 Let's go. Finish this up.
4557970 4561258 - Right now. Finish it up, come on. Let's go.<br />- Okay. Okay.
4562849 4564089 Fuck.
4582661 4584072 Get in there. Get in there.
4630042 4631032 Okay.
4636673 4640792 - Let's go. We gotta get out of here.<br />- What is the point? Man, what is the point?
4640969 4643131 Hey, knock that off, come on.
4643305 4648846 This has something to do with that code you<br />wrote for them. Think. Come on, help us win.
4649019 4652637 Win? When do we start winning?
4652814 4657058 Look around. Are you out of your mind?<br />Does it look like we're close to winning?
4657235 4659647 We just got the shit kicked out of us.
4659821 4661858 You think I'm holding out on you?
4662032 4665900 If I knew what they wanted, I would<br />tell you. I would happily tell you.
4666578 4668410 Jesus.
4704658 4707616 The Warlock. The Warlock.
4707786 4710778 Great.<br />There goes the cellphone.
4710956 4714449 - They knocked the satellites out of the skies?<br />- No, your battery ran out.
4714626 4716367 - We should go see him.<br />- Who?
4716545 4719207 The Warlock. We should drive<br />to his house in Baltimore.
4719381 4723124 - Can't go to the Warlock's house now.<br />- Hey, hey, hey. This is me helping you.
4723301 4727260 Okay? Trust me. We gotta go see<br />the Warlock. That's our only hope.
4732978 4736846 - How do you feel about flying?<br />- About what? Like, with a pilot?
4744531 4747239 - Just stick it in the round thing.<br />- What brown thing?
4747409 4749400 Here, put these on.
4750328 4752786 Just stick it in there. That'll work.
4752956 4756870 - You okay?<br />- Yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.
4757043 4759410 - I used to be terrified of flying.<br />- Really?
4759588 4762956 Yeah. I took some lessons.<br />Face your fears, that kind of thing.
4763133 4765921 - Yeah? Did it help?<br />- Not really.
4766803 4768419 Is it...?
4771016 4773758 - Is it supposed to make that sound?<br />- Yeah.
4775520 4780014 - Maybe we should just drive.<br />- Take it easy. Taking off is the hardest part.
4780192 4781603 Really? I heard...
4781777 4786192 - To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.<br />- You did? Really?
4786364 4789857 But you have your license, right?<br />I mean, you can fly one of these things?
4790869 4794362 - Oh, God.<br />- Hey! Here we go. We're up.
4794539 4796371 Oh, God.
4799044 4802582 Okay. That's good. That's pretty good.
4804841 4807833 Jesus, look at that.<br />This whole area's blacked out.
4810096 4812303 How we gonna find Warlock's house?
4812474 4815637 It's probably gonna be<br />the one with the lights still on.
4823568 4827357 Power outage keeps spreading. About half<br />the East Coast has already gone down.
4828990 4832403 All right. Put everything<br />on emergency generators.
4832577 4834909 How the hell are they<br />getting past us?
4838750 4840832 Okay. Down there, down there. I see it.
4841002 4842618 - Down there?<br />- Left, left. Down.
4846591 4849003 What? Are we gonna land down there?
4850887 4852719 - All right, hang on.<br />- Okay. Okay.
4856268 4857724 Fence. Fence. Fence.
4860272 4861933 - Fence. Fence.<br />- I see it.
4862607 4864063 Watch...
4876037 4877903 - Oh, Jesus.<br />- Come on.
4878081 4880948 Oh, yeah.<br />Taking off is the hardest part.
4881376 4882537 Let's go.
4885755 4888713 Now, there's something<br />you need to know about Warlock.
4888884 4890591 He hates cops. Hates them.
4890760 4892797 So just let me do all the talking.
4902397 4903432 Shit.
4904858 4907065 Hey, Mrs. Kaludis.
4907235 4908771 Is Freddy home?
4910822 4913814 I'm Matt Farrell and this is...
4913992 4915699 Billy.
4916286 4920621 We're friends from Space Camp.<br />I went to Space Camp with Freddy.
4922167 4923248 Freddy!
4924336 4927920 - You got company.<br />- Freddy?
4928131 4929792 Freddy, get the fuck up here!
4936514 4939597 Frederick. Didn't you hear me?
4939768 4941679 All Baltimore heard you, Ma.
4941853 4944686 - Your friends are here.<br />- Friends? What the...?
4945690 4949684 Come on, Ma. How many times I gotta<br />tell you, don't bring people down here?
4949861 4954697 I can't see too good. Is that a young, bearded<br />Han Solo? You've lost so much weight.
4954866 4958029 No, I gained 30 pounds. Who is that?<br />Know what? Doesn't matter.
4958244 4962863 What are you doing here? Because of you,<br />I'm rocking five generators to stay online.
4963041 4969287 And since you're being hunted by assassins,<br />this visit is not a healthy use of my time.
4969464 4971501 Hey, don't touch that, all right?
4972467 4976210 CB radio?<br />A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?
4976388 4979926 That, my friend, is an end-of-the-world<br />insurance system, okay?
4980100 4983513 When the last microchip goes down,<br />I can stay in touch with whoever's out there...
4983687 4985803 whether they be zombies or not.
4985981 4990191 - What'd you bring your dad here for?<br />- He's cool. He's into the gaming culture.
4990360 4991475 Nice poster.
4993071 4998737 - What? Like, you a big fan of the Fett?<br />- No. I was always more of a Star Wars guy.
4999494 5002282 - Star Wars guy. Who is this man?<br />- He's kidding. He's my...
5002455 5004787 Hey, Jenny Craig. I'm not his dad.
5004958 5008917 - I'm a cop. How about that?<br />- A cop. I'm sorry. Thank you.
5009087 5011749 Why'd you bring a cop<br />into my command center?
5011923 5014585 Command center. It's a basement.
5014759 5017091 - It's a command center.<br />- Don't help. I can explain.
5017262 5021005 Just tell us about Thomas Gabriel,<br />all right? That's why we came here.
5021182 5023173 Thomas Gabriel. I didn't know. Sorry.
5023351 5025592 Get out!<br />I want you out of here, right now.
5025770 5028933 Hey, hey! Calm down.<br />Just calm down, big boy.
5029107 5030848 You calm down.<br />It's my house.
5031609 5035603 You're gonna tell me what I wanna know,<br />or I'll beat you to death in your own house.
5050754 5055043 Four years ago, the DOD recruits Thomas<br />Gabriel to be a cyberspook for them, okay?
5055216 5057253 First day on the job, tells his bosses...
5057427 5060965 this nation's security infrastructure<br />is wide open to compromise.
5061139 5066225 They say, we'll take it under advisement.<br />But this dude don't ease up. He is committed.
5066394 5069227 So he breaks into a meeting<br />of the Joint Chiefs of Staff...
5069397 5074233 and using just a laptop, hacks into NORAD<br />and shuts down our defense network.
5074402 5077645 So they put a gun to the man's head<br />and forced him to stop the hack.
5077822 5081941 Thomas Gabriel's the guy who shut down<br />NORAD with a laptop, just to prove a point.
5082118 5084780 - You think I'm scared of you?<br />- Tell us how to find him.
5084954 5087992 How do I know? He's a ghost, man.<br />He just fell off the grid.
5088166 5090282 - Another dead end. Come on.<br />- Hold on. Wait.
5090460 5093828 Listen, Warlock,<br />a couple of weeks ago I wrote a...
5094005 5096497 I know.<br />A mutating algorithmic security code...
5096674 5099507 that's probably being used<br />by Thomas Gabriel now.
5099677 5102965 No, we know that. Yes.<br />Can you tell us what he's using it for?
5103139 5106222 I don't know. I've been trying<br />to figure that out. Here, look.
5107018 5110056 The only security system in the country<br />that I can find...
5110230 5114599 currently employing that template<br />is the Social Security Administration.
5114776 5120067 But they don't use it in the main facility. Look.<br />They use it in this building, in Woodlawn.
5120240 5123278 - What the hell? God.<br />- I know, right?
5123451 5127069 - What are you talking about?<br />- The power consumption's off the charts.
5127247 5129739 - It's hot. It's on fire.<br />- Why are there chilling towers?
5129916 5132328 - That's what I thought.<br />- Hello.
5132544 5134205 What's a chilling tower?
5135130 5137497 See what I've been dealing with?
5137674 5141133 Large server farms generate a lot<br />of heat and need to be cooled.
5141302 5142633 But why there?
5142804 5146342 I don't know what's in that building,<br />but it's not Social Security numbers.
5153106 5157225 I got a red flag over here.<br />Someone's hacking into Woodlawn.
5159112 5160978 Honing in on the host server right now.
5163074 5164564 Frederick Kaludis.
5165368 5167405 - Let's have a look at him.<br />- Fat bastard.
5172417 5173782 McClane.
5173960 5178295 - Where is his daughter?<br />- We just got a trace on her cell.
5178464 5179920 You're gonna love this.
5184262 5186799 All right. Let's get a better<br />look at you.
5199068 5200854 - Freddy?<br />- What?
5201029 5204567 What the hell are you doing<br />dicking around inside my network?
5208745 5209906 McClane.
5210872 5212704 I thought I killed you already.
5212874 5214785 I get that sometimes.
5217962 5220954 You think you can try to track where he is?
5221257 5222247 - Dude, yeah.<br />- Detective...
5222425 5226544 Covering the camera with your hand<br />does not turn off the microphone.
5227972 5233308 Yeah, I know I'm not as smart as you guys<br />with all this computer shit.
5234103 5237721 But, hey, I'm still alive, ain't I?
5238733 5242897 I mean, you got to be running out<br />of bad guys by now, right?
5245782 5246943 Gabriel?
5247367 5250405 Honestly, you can tell me.<br />How's that work?
5250578 5255243 You got some kind of service?<br />Some kind of 800 number? 1-800-HENCHMEN?
5255416 5257748 I bet you're still on hold with...
5257919 5261332 Can I get another dead Asian hooker bitch<br />over here right away?
5262840 5269507 But seriously, all that kicking aside,<br />that skinny little ninja chick, she was smoking hot.
5269681 5272844 One of those gotta be real hard<br />to come by, right?
5273017 5276601 - You're impressed with yourself, aren't you?<br />- I have my moments.
5276771 5278557 Yeah?
5280358 5282190 Is this one of them?
5286781 5289614 - Hello?<br />- Yes, this is Emergency Services calling.
5289784 5291525 - Thank God.<br />- Can she hear me?
5291703 5295321 My name is Lucy Gennaro.<br />I'm stuck in here. My cell's not working.
5295498 5298206 Can she hear this?<br />Lucy, hang up that phone.
5298376 5302495 Just calm down, miss.<br />We know exactly where you are.
5302672 5304458 Everything is gonna be all right.
5304632 5309251 - Lucy, hang up the phone.<br />- John, I'm trying to have a conversation.
5312015 5314973 We're a bit overloaded tonight,<br />as you may imagine.
5315143 5317601 But I assure you<br />we're gonna get you out of there.
5317770 5322014 - Even if I have to come down there myself.<br />- Thank you.
5322191 5325684 In the meantime, is there anyone<br />we can contact for you?
5325862 5327398 Yeah.
5328323 5329734 My dad.
5330742 5334235 His name is John McClane.<br />He's a New York City cop.
5335038 5341250 We'll find him. Just hang in there, miss,<br />and we'll get to you, very soon.
5342837 5344794 Thank you.
5345923 5350588 That's a great girl you got there.<br />Can't wait to meet her.
5351179 5353716 What's the matter? Cat got your tongue?
5353890 5355927 Come on, John.
5357143 5358759 Make a joke.
5359854 5361936 Say something funny.
5368863 5371070 Wait. Where you going?
5371616 5376110 McClane. Hold on.<br />Where you going? What are you gonna do?
5376287 5378824 I'm gonna kill this motherfucker<br />and get my daughter back.
5378998 5380955 Or go get my daughter<br />and kill this motherfucker.
5381125 5382456 - But she could be anywhere.<br />- Listen.
5382627 5383788 You can't go, okay?
5383961 5388421 Just go play a computer game<br />with Hamhock.
5388591 5389877 - Warlock. Yeah.<br />- Warlock.
5390051 5392793 - Either way, you should just stay here.<br />- I think I...
5392970 5396088 Hey, I'm doing you a favor, all right?
5396265 5398302 It's gonna get messy.
5399018 5400929 I'll take it from here.
5401104 5403345 Thanks for your help.
5416035 5417400 Buckle up.
5444689 5446851 FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.
5447024 5448355 Mind if I see your ID?
5449193 5450354 Not at all.
5460204 5462536 My dad's a cop. Force of habit.
5463291 5466124 Your father sounds like a very smart man.
5471215 5473547 Kid, can you get Bowman?
5473718 5475174 Yeah.
5485396 5487353 It's completely dead.
5487523 5491061 Gabriel must have shut down<br />all the satellite links. Shit.
5496365 5498857 I'm sorry about Lucy, man.
5501412 5503244 About all of it.
5503789 5506531 It was my fault you got into this.<br />This wasn't your fight.
5506709 5508291 You got nothing to be sorry about.
5513508 5516341 - Let go of me, you bastard.<br />- This bitch is a handful.
5522517 5524724 Are you gonna be all right?
5526729 5529437 Hey. Behave or I will hurt you.
5529607 5534568 Oh, yeah? Let's step outside,<br />just you and me. We'll see who hurts who.
5536531 5538772 You really are his daughter.
5538950 5540486 Tie her wrists.
5547792 5550079 Trey, Gabriel wants to see you.
5550253 5552039 - Is it that time already?<br />- Yeah.
5556342 5559004 I'll be back in a second.
5563975 5565136 No, no, no, please.
5613524 5616186 We're showing a breach on an exterior vent.
5620531 5621862 Go take a look.
5623534 5625696 Don't be long. We're packing up soon.
5637423 5641087 Hey, McClane, do we have anything<br />resembling a plan?
5641260 5643217 Yeah, find Lucy and kill everybody else.
5643387 5645879 No, I mean more like a plan.<br />Like, a way to do that.
5646057 5648389 I gotta get a gun. Keep your eyes open.
5649435 5651426 Come on.
5652563 5656477 Okay, according to the layout,<br />the chilling towers are kept on the bottom level.
5656651 5658813 Keep your voice down.
5663407 5664772 I think mine's locked.
5668913 5671621 Okay. Now it looks like<br />we're getting somewhere.
5683678 5688423 Okay, this looks like it controls the cooling<br />system for the mainframe, which should be...
5690017 5691849 If I can just hack in...
5693729 5696437 and trip the alarm,<br />it might alert Bowman.
5705032 5706773 Someone set off the alarms.
5706951 5710569 Yes. Thank you, detective. I can hear that.<br />Find a way to turn it off.
5715209 5716540 What have you got?
5718295 5721208 We got a problem.<br />The alarms went off at Woodlawn.
5723134 5724249 It's gotta be him.
5725136 5727127 And what's Woodlawn?
5731392 5735260 It's NSA. A secure facility<br />outside of Baltimore.
5735646 5740311 It's a failsafe we built after 9/11<br />to back up all financial information.
5740484 5745399 The moment the networks were hit, all financial<br />data began downloading to those servers.
5745573 5750534 Banks, Wall Street, corporate records,<br />government funds. All of it.
5750703 5754446 Basically, a backup for<br />the accumulated wealth of America.
5754707 5756869 All in one location?
5757543 5758954 What could Gabriel do with it?
5759128 5763087 If he could get in, he could download<br />the data, use it to siphon billions.
5763257 5767592 Or, knowing him, he could erase it all<br />and send us all back to the Stone Age.
5768929 5774220 - Why the hell wasn't I told about this?<br />- Frankly, it's above your pay grade.
5774393 5775975 My pay grade?
5777521 5781139 I'm in charge of the infrastructure,<br />you arrogant prick.
5782193 5786027 How the hell did Gabriel find out about this<br />when even I didn't know about it?
5789825 5791361 He designed it.
5793496 5795203 It was his program.
5795498 5799457 He knew that hacking your system<br />last night would trigger the download.
5806050 5809259 Let me see if I can get<br />a floor plan of this place.
5809887 5810877 Don't move.
5812139 5814551 You, get away from the bag. Now.
5814725 5815931 Okay, okay.
5816268 5818680 We've been waiting for you.
5819438 5822726 Yeah? I've been waiting for you too.
5839917 5842534 Fuck this motherfucker!
5850261 5851717 McClane!
5853430 5854920 McClane!
5857601 5858932 Kid?
5859395 5860430 Matt!
5860604 5861685 Kid.
5875119 5876985 Emerson.
5878247 5880579 We have a problem in<br />one of the cooling towers.
5880749 5881955 - Tower seven.<br />- Tower seven.
5882293 5883454 Find out what's going on.
5894138 5895128 Sir?
5895306 5897638 Get the HR team into choppers.<br />We need to get to Woodlawn.
5897808 5900596 They're saying it'll take at least 20 minutes<br />to get the team on site.
5901437 5903599 We don't have 20 minutes.
5904356 5907348 Look, the Pentagon<br />has jets flying CAP over D.C.
5907526 5910439 Have them send one to Woodlawn<br />and keep an eye on things.
5910613 5911944 Let's go.
5925252 5927243 Where's my daughter?
5927421 5929708 Russo, check in.
5933677 5938217 Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down<br />to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.
5938849 5941932 Hold on a minute.<br />Looks like he's coming around.
5942519 5944510 It's McClane. He's on the third floor.
5949026 5951939 Get all that? That's right.
5952404 5955988 I'm on the third floor.<br />But I'm coming to get you.
5964375 5965490 Time to take a nap, pal.
5970422 5972880 Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.
5982518 5985101 Oh, shit. Oh, God.
6019179 6020965 My algorithm.
6027104 6029266 Okay, please, God.
6030149 6032140 Please, God.
6068312 6071304 Oh, Jesus, they're going after the money.
6094338 6097171 You coming to get me, John?<br />Is that the plan?
6097341 6099332 Yep, that's my plan.
6099676 6102919 What makes you think I won't put<br />a bullet in your daughter's head?
6103097 6106260 - Because you're scared of me.<br />- You think I'm afraid of you?
6107059 6110222 Otherwise, she'd be dead already.<br />She's your bargaining chip.
6117361 6119853 Stop there. Hands up.
6120197 6122404 If you kill me,<br />you'll never get it open.
6125577 6127534 Move away. Move!
6135045 6139039 You know, John, I feel like<br />we've gotten off on the wrong foot.
6139216 6142709 And because of that,<br />you think I'm the bad guy.
6142886 6145594 Nothing could be further from the truth.<br />I'm the good guy.
6145764 6149177 I told them this could happen<br />if they didn't prepare.
6149351 6152844 Did I get a thank-you?<br />No, I got a fuck-you. But they wouldn't listen.
6153021 6156730 - You got their attention now, don't you?<br />- That's right.
6156900 6161519 - I am doing the country a favor.<br />- By tearing it apart.
6161697 6166737 Better me than some outsider.<br />Some religious nutjob bent on Armageddon.
6166910 6169402 Nobody wants to see that happen.
6169580 6175792 Everything I've broken can be fixed<br />if the country is willing to pay for it.
6175961 6179249 Oh, fuck you.<br />It's always been about the money.
6179423 6183417 What? I shouldn't get paid for my work?<br />I'm working my ass off here, John.
6183677 6185759 I'm on my way to bring you<br />a big fucking check.
6190434 6194268 I can't talk to this guy. You talk to him,<br />see if you can get him to focus.
6195147 6196182 Dad?
6199276 6200687 Hi, baby.
6201278 6202939 Now there are only five of them.
6206283 6208741 Hang on, Lucy. I'm coming.
6219087 6222580 Would somebody<br />please kill this son of a bitch?
6224218 6225959 We have a problem.
6226887 6230676 There's actually no problem.<br />I just got off on the wrong floor.
6233477 6235639 This is a mess.
6237481 6241691 Wow, I'm truly impressed, man.<br />Hacking every byte of financial data...
6241860 6245819 for the entire country would take weeks<br />unless you eliminated the congestion.
6246198 6248439 That's what this fire sale is about,<br />isn't it?
6248617 6252576 - That's brilliant.<br />- Yes, it is. Please be quiet.
6252746 6254987 - Asshole.<br />- Who are you?
6255832 6257243 Matt Farrell.
6258252 6260243 Lucy McClane.
6260671 6264039 I thought your name was Gennaro.<br />Lucy Gennaro.
6264216 6265877 Not today.
6266051 6269965 - Can you crack the code?<br />- Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.
6270138 6272345 That's encouraging.
6274017 6276258 Take them with us.
6276436 6278427 - Let's go.<br />- Let's go.
6281149 6283811 Gabriel, Pentagon just sent<br />an F-35 towards us.
6283986 6286023 Keep an eye on it.
6287906 6290238 Pulling down the go codes now.
6306216 6309379 You might wanna think about<br />what you want on your headstone, asshole.
6316768 6319260 Christ! Goddamn hamster.
6320188 6321519 There you go.
6321690 6324022 Stay still, spider-boy.
6328113 6329729 That's right.
6358935 6360221 Goddamn it!
6369988 6371945 Oh, no.
6375660 6379949 You probably shouldn't antagonize them,<br />since they have all the loaded guns.
6380248 6384617 Take a minute and dig deep for a bigger<br />set of balls, because you're gonna need them.
6384795 6389130 I know that tone. It's just weird<br />hearing it from someone with hair.
6426378 6427459 Sir.
6427629 6429336 ETA, 15 minutes.
6484603 6486310 Fix it.
6486480 6489598 Why? You're just gonna kill me if I fix it.<br />I know that.
6490066 6491556 Stop.
6496531 6497987 Oh, shit.
6501786 6503652 I'm not gonna do it.
6507959 6511702 - No, no, no. Shit.<br />- Robinson is coming pretty fast.
6511880 6513917 - I'm sorry, what?<br />- Something's wrong.
6514090 6515922 Robinson is coming too fast.
6520472 6522429 It's not Robinson.
6522599 6524306 That would be my dad.
6535862 6537978 Freddy?
6538907 6540693 Freddy.
6541618 6543325 It's John McClane.
6543495 6546954 Look, I know you can hear me.<br />This is your frequency, right? 666.
6547123 6549831 Come on, pick up the mike, Freddy.
6552504 6554791 Nobody here by that name. Sorry.
6554965 6556626 Hacker jerkoff!
6561054 6562294 Warlock.
6563223 6568389 I need you to do whatever it is you do<br />to patch me through to the FBI.
6568562 6570473 To Deputy Director Bowman.
6570647 6573139 - You hear me?<br />- Are you serious?
6573316 6575774 You want me to intentionally<br />open up a com line...
6575944 6579687 to the head of the FBI's cyber division?<br />I don't think so.
6580031 6582193 Freddy, goddamn it,<br />they have my daughter!
6587831 6590163 I can do that. Hold on.
6591418 6593159 Thank you.
6599676 6602668 This is Central.<br />We have a patch for Director Bowman.
6603513 6606255 Sir. Central's trying to reach you.
6607517 6608723 Go.
6608893 6611351 - Bowman, it's McClane.<br />- McClane.
6611521 6615310 Listen to me. Gabriel is on the 695<br />headed north in a Hazmat truck.
6615483 6618771 Wait, Gabriel has left Woodlawn?<br />We're headed there right now.
6618945 6621357 Bowman. He's got my daughter.
6623366 6627906 Listen, this Hazmat truck is a government<br />vehicle, so it should be LoJacked, right?
6628079 6630195 Track that down, it should take you to him.
6630373 6633866 - Give me the tag number.<br />- All right. Hang on. Here it comes.
6634044 6636081 Golf. Tango.
6637672 6641711 Five. Niner. Two. November.
6641885 6644468 Got it. McClane, where is Farrell?
6644638 6645878 He's with them.
6647015 6648426 Listen to me.
6648600 6652969 I'm gonna go in there and get Lucy out,<br />but if something happens to me...
6653146 6657390 you gotta send the cavalry in, you hear me?<br />I mean everybody.
6657776 6659892 Don't let that maniac get my daughter.
6660070 6663153 - John, don't worry.<br />- I want your word, Bowman.
6665742 6667324 Yeah, you have it.
6668244 6669905 McClane out.
6677295 6678410 There's the F-35.
6681091 6682923 Did you get the go codes?
6683259 6685842 - Trey. Did you get the go codes?<br />- Yes. I got the codes.
6686012 6690381 Can you connect me to the pilot?
6705073 6706655 Isolating his radio.
6712622 6714954 Sending him the go codes.
6721548 6722754 AV-81.
6722924 6728135 - AV-81, this is Marine Air Wing ATC.<br />- Go for AV-81.
6728304 6731968 Confirmed terrorist vehicle<br />located in your sector. A big rig truck.
6733476 6736264 - Currently in pursuit of a Hazmat vehicle.<br />- I see them.
6736438 6739100 You are authorized to engage<br />and destroy.
6739274 6741561 Copy that. AV-81 engaging.
6749909 6751070 What?
6759002 6762040 Jesus Christ! Goddamn it!
6765341 6767127 You're shooting at the wrong guy!
6775185 6777347 I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.
6789866 6790856 Hey!
6791284 6792991 Jackass!
6840124 6842365 Is that it?
6845255 6846586 Is that your best shot?
6890133 6891464 Come on!
6900226 6901432 Damn it.
6917911 6919527 Come on.
7013047 7014958 Let's go. Come on.
7015133 7017170 That way. It's that way. Go.
7018594 7019709 Let's go. Move it.
7026269 7028761 We are leaving in three minutes.
7032233 7034440 You have one.
7034610 7037944 The rules haven't changed.<br />You'll kill me the minute I unlock it.
7038740 7041607 No!
7041951 7044784 - Oh, shit. Oh, shit.<br />- Matthew?
7044954 7048037 Matthew!<br />I really need you to pay attention.
7049208 7052826 - The rules can always change.<br />- Okay, wait.
7053004 7055336 - I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.<br />- Wait, wait, wait.
7055506 7057292 Nine.
7057467 7058957 I can't.
7059135 7061046 Eight.
7061220 7062961 I can't.
7063765 7065051 Oh, God.
7068102 7069183 Okay.
7071230 7072641 Okay, okay, okay.
7072815 7074305 Six.
7074484 7078318 Okay, stop. Stop, stop.<br />I'm doing it. I'm doing it.
7078488 7080946 Oh, God. Oh, my God.
7094629 7096165 Feds are headed this way.
7097048 7099506 - Get everything on the plane.<br />- Yep.
7109602 7111343 - Dad.<br />- Careful.
7111521 7114764 Don't worry, baby.<br />Everything's gonna be all right.
7116859 7118315 Daddy!
7124158 7125694 No!
7125868 7127984 Hold this.
7150184 7151640 No.
7153271 7154477 Jesus Christ.
7155565 7157647 You got her?
7158109 7159975 You're sure?
7162113 7163603 Nice effort though.
7164407 7167399 - Matthew.<br />- Oh, shit. All right, Okay.
7167577 7169284 Okay. I'm doing it. I know.
7177295 7178911 McClane.
7179422 7181789 Would you do me a favor?
7183634 7188595 I know the lights are beginning to dim,<br />but if you could just hang on for a second.
7188764 7191882 As soon as Matt's finished,<br />I'm gonna kill him and your daughter.
7192059 7194767 And I would love for you<br />to see that.
7196439 7198646 Goddamn it. Matthew?
7199025 7201437 Ten seconds, okay?<br />You'll have all your money.
7201611 7205605 - You just leave. No one has to get hurt.<br />- A few seconds. Stay with me.
7205781 7208773 McClane.
7208951 7211318 - Stay with me.<br />- Dad?
7212121 7217287 On your tombstone it should read, always<br />in the wrong place at the wrong time.
7218169 7222379 How about,<br />yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker.
7235853 7238470 Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.
7238648 7241561 - Are you okay?<br />- Yes, baby, I'm fine.
7243861 7245317 I knew you'd come for me.
7245488 7249982 Of course I'd come for you, honey.<br />Sorry it took me so long. It's okay.
7258084 7259620 Move, move!
7264799 7266164 Freeze!
7266509 7269171 Hold, hold. He's okay.
7271347 7274009 - Get that vehicle.<br />- Come around.
7274183 7276174 - Here, help Daddy up.<br />- Okay.
7276352 7280767 Wait, wait.<br />I think I'll just stay here for a minute.
7281190 7285184 - Okay. Daddy, you're out of your mind.<br />- What are you talking about?
7285361 7290106 - You shot yourself.<br />- It seemed like a good idea at the time.
7290283 7293196 Don't tell these guys that I did that.
7304714 7307502 - Thanks for all your help, John.<br />- Thank you.
7309552 7311384 Is he okay?
7312555 7315263 - Should I put my hands up?<br />- No, don't put your hands up.
7315433 7316889 Put them down farther?
7317852 7320719 Might die of shock<br />on the way to the hospital.
7324859 7326145 All right.
7328738 7330399 I'll be right back.
7332366 7334448 - Hey.<br />- Oh, hey.
7334618 7337201 - How's it feel to be shot?<br />- It actually feels great.
7337371 7340705 He gave me some...<br />What's it called? Morphine.
7340875 7344743 - Well, you got your merit badge now.<br />- Yeah. I don't know what that means.
7346589 7350423 - Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.<br />- Really?
7352053 7353418 Not that one.
7354221 7355882 - What?<br />- Don't even think about it.
7356057 7359766 How did you know what I was thinking?<br />Did she say something to you?
7359935 7363849 - I felt like we had kind of a vibe.<br />- Easy. That's just the morphine kicking in.
7364023 7365855 Yeah.
7366025 7370940 Besides, after all we've been through,<br />I'd hate to have to beat you to death.
7372865 7374447 That would suck.
7376410 7378196 - Good to go?<br />- Yeah, all set.
7378371 7381909 Take care of yourself.<br />I'll see you at the hospital.
7385753 7386993 Hey.
7388422 7390254 Thanks for saving my daughter's life.
7390800 7392131 Hey.
7393219 7394630 What was I gonna do?
7397056 7399093 That's what makes you that guy.
7402228 7403810 Yeah.
7409985 7412773 So, did he say anything about me?
7414698 7416735 Jesus, Lucy.
7416909 7418991 What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.
7420579 7422946 I'm in enough pain already.
7423124 7424865 Hospital.
