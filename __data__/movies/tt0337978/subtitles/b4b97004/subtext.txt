102260 104080 I gotta file a damage report.<br />Very important.
104180 105200 LAMBERT: Bonwit Teller.
105300 107184 Who would want to blow up<br />a department store?
107284 109039 KOWALSKI: Ever see a woman<br />miss a shoe sale?
109139 111408 WALTER: Connie, get started<br />on the witness sheet.
111508 112591 Ricky, you and Joe...
112691 115375 ...make sure the uniforms<br />got it cordoned off there...
115475 118255 ...and don't let the damn TV crews in.
118355 119215 WOMAN: Inspector, phone.
119315 120655 INSPECTOR: Not now. Benson, traffic.
120755 121820 Get Fifth Avenue cleared up by 3:00...
123123 125455 ...or we got the traffic jam from hell.
125555 129210 WOMAN: Walter,<br />I think you'd better take this.
131888 133838 Major-case unit.<br />Inspector Cobb.
133938 136974 SIMON: Said Simple Simon to<br />the pie man going to the fair...
137074 140557 'Give me your pies,<br />or I'll cave your head in.'
140657 144715 Bonwit's was just to make sure<br />I had your attention.
144815 147818 SIMON: Is there a detective<br />named McClane there?
147918 149421 He's on suspension.
149521 151373 SIMON: No, Walter. He's not.
151473 152333 Not today.
152433 153708 WALTER: Who is this?
153808 155148 SIMON: Call me Simon.
155248 156588 WALTER: What do you want?
156688 158508 SIMON: I want to play a game.
158608 159948 WALTER: What kind of game?
160048 162048 SIMON: Simon says.
162894 165227 SIMON: Simon's going to tell<br />McClane what to do...
165327 168267 ...and Lieutenant McClane is going to do it.
168367 171682 Non-compliance will result in a penalty.
172012 173387 WALTER: What penalty?
173487 177397 SIMON: Another big bang<br />in a very public place.
179212 182346 What is it that you want<br />Lieutenant McClane to do?
182446 183946 Simon says Lieutenant McClane...
184046 187306 ...is to go to the corner<br />of 138th Street und Amsterdam...
187406 189706 ...which is in Harlem,<br />if I'm not mistaken.
189806 193225 WALTER: Kowalski. Lambert.<br />You know where to find McClane?
193325 195913 LAMBERT: I kind of doubt<br />you'll find him in church.
196013 199111 You better find out what rock he's under...
199211 201211 ...and kick it over.
211690 213690 KOWALSKI: John.
214761 216761 Thanks.
222441 224441 Give me a few more.
226472 229385 Jesus, John.<br />You look like shit.
231944 233414 [John belches]
233514 236294 Where did we leave off with that roster?
236394 239654 RICKY: We got three killings<br />in Redhook the past two nights.
239754 241894 WALTER: Put Miner on it. And Genetti.
241994 243846 The mayor's office will call<br />before the day's out.
243946 245958 RICKY: Next, 14 dump trucks stolen...
246058 248262 ...from a yard in Staten Island.
248362 250181 Fourteen? Jesus.
250281 252101 Are they starting a construction company?
252201 255237 LAMBERT: It was John's landlady<br />going to clean his apartment.
255337 256901 [Kowalski laughs]
257001 259001 Insurance fraud.
259463 262562 Trucks are probably<br />already out in California.
262662 264516 Contractor splits the money<br />with the thieves.
264616 267460 We had that in Jersey<br />couple years ago, Joe, remember?
267560 270178 WALTER: See what Kelly can do with it.
270278 272739 Hey, what was the lottery<br />number last night?
272839 275304 EVERYONE: Four-six-six-seven.
276101 277891 You still betting your badge, Rick?
277991 279875 RICKY: Yeah.
279975 282657 Sixty-nine-ninety-one every week.
282757 284931 Six-nine-ninety-one.<br />Lucky number.
285031 287170 LAMBERT: Half the cops here<br />play their badges.
287270 289905 WALTER: How are the kids, John?
290980 293314 They're OK. Ahem.
293414 296049 WALTER: Did you talk with Holly?
298179 300162 No, I didn't talk to Holly.
300262 302982 MAN: Coming up on it, Inspector.
303395 305729 JOHN: Is it hot,<br />or am I just scared to death?
305829 308382 WALTER: Wanna make sure<br />the gun's secure?
308482 310607 LAMBERT: Yeah. It's good.
317634 320704 JOHN: You're the first woman<br />since Holly to see me do this.
320804 322804 KOWALSKI: I'm honoured.
322946 325282 Yeah, so was she.
328161 331553 So...where's the backup going to be?
334561 337567 We're going to draw back to 128th Street.
337667 339667 What?
339872 342677 Ten blocks?<br />You fucking kidding me?
343008 344542 Oh, man. That's just great.
344642 346814 Walter, what is all this about?
346914 349822 If we don't do what he says,<br />hell blow up another place.
349922 350942 JOHN: Why me?
351042 355547 WALTER: I have no idea.<br />He just said it had to be you.
355968 358013 JOHN: It's nice to be needed.
358113 359581 Frankly, John--
359681 363227 How about you mind your fucking<br />business about Holly, huh?
363327 367832 You and Simon are fucking up<br />a perfectly good hangover.
369598 371598 OK.
373149 376294 [Loud rap music playing from boombox]
380766 383435 WALTER: We'll be back<br />to pick you up in 15 minutes.
383535 386935 Take your time.<br />I expect to be dead in four.
387261 389261 Let's go, Billy.
423834 425834 [Car horn honks]
437977 439175 OLDER BOY: Yo,
439275 441825 YOUNGER BOY: Come look at this.
441912 444726 ZEUS: It's 10 after9:00.<br />Why aren't you in school?
444826 446151 BOY: Tony wants to sell this.
446251 449510 ZEUS: Tony. That no-neck dude<br />they call Bad T?
449610 451590 YOUNGER BOY: He found it in a dumpster.
451690 453750 He keeps stealing,<br />theyll find him in a dumpster.
453850 456742 OLDER BOY: He didn't steal it.<br />His uncle gave it to him.
456842 460327 ZEUS: Mm-hmm.<br />Hand me that newspaper there.
462391 463926 ZEUS: Don't ever let people use you.
464026 466325 You're running all over town<br />with stolen property.
466425 468133 If you get caught,<br />you get in trouble...
468233 470005 ...while he denies the whole thing.
470105 473732 YOUNG BOY: You mean you want us<br />to take it back to Tony?
473832 476389 ZEUS: No.<br />I'll take it back to Tony...
476489 477988 ...with a message.
478088 479924 Now, where you going?
480024 481220 YOUNG BOY: School.
481320 482468 Why?<br />- To get educated.
482568 484548 Why?<br />- So we can go to college.
484648 486787 And why is that important?<br />- To get 'espect.
486887 488724 ZEUS: Respect.<br />And who's the bad guys?
488824 491267 Guys who sell drugs.<br />- Guys who have guns.
491367 493331 Who are the good guys?<br />- We're the good guys.
493431 495395 Who's going to help you?<br />- Nobody.
495495 497667 So who's going to help you?<br />- We're gonna help ourselves.
497767 500323 Who do we not want to help us?<br />- White people.
500423 502423 That's right.
502644 505874 ZEUS: Get on out of here.<br />Go to school.
509844 510978 OLDER BOY: Uncle,<br />you better come look at this.
511078 512129 ZEUS: What?
512229 514001 BOY: There's a white man<br />standing in the street.
514101 515105 ZEUS: I've seen one.
515205 517205 Not like this.
523187 525187 [Horn honks]
526323 529121 Dial 911. Tell the police<br />to get up here quick.
529221 531771 Somebody's about to get killed.
531890 533920 And get your butts to school,<br />you hear?
534020 535040 BOYS: Yeah.
535140 537140 ZEUS: All right.
540561 543876 YOUNG MAN: Man, you best back off, man.
559920 561920 ZEUS: Morning.
562640 563838 JOHN: Good morning.
563938 567357 You having a nice day, sir?<br />You feeling all right?
567457 569310 Not to get too personal...
569410 571357 ...but a white man standing in Harlem...
571457 573917 ...wearing a sign that says,<br />'I hate niggers...'
574017 575693 has either got serious personal issues...
575793 578397 ...or not all his dogs are barking.
578497 580333 Hey, I'm talking to you.
580433 583516 You got about 10 seconds<br />before those guys see you...
583616 586876 ...and when they do, they will<br />kill you. You understand?
586976 589756 You are about to have a very bad day.
589856 591856 Yeah, tell me about it.
593006 594860 It's a police matter.<br />For your safety--
594960 596476 You damn right it's a police matter.
596576 599836 I suggest you hide your butt in<br />my shop till the police arrive.
599936 602146 YOUNG MAN: What the fuck?.
603117 605117 Aw, shit.
612204 614490 Listen, I'm a cop on a case.<br />- What?
614590 615946 Somebody blew up Bonwit Teller's.
616046 617434 You hear about that?<br />- Yeah.
617534 619514 The asshole responsible<br />said I gotta do this...
619614 621402 ...or he's gonna blow up something else.
621502 622522 ZEUS: Shit, shit, shit.
622622 624730 JOHN: I got a gun.<br />Get across the street.
624830 626825 ZEUS: Start acting crazy,<br />like Looney Toons...
626925 627913 like Bellevue.
628013 630153 YOUNG MAN: Hey, Zeus. This your friend?
630253 632569 ZEUS: He look like a friend of mine?
632669 635289 I think the dude just escaped<br />from some hospital...
635389 637684 ...you know, like Bellevue?
640490 642490 JOHN: I am the...
643050 645050 ...voice of my own God.
645084 646136 And my God...
646236 648488 I told the librarian I had a bad headache...
648588 649592 ...but she didn't believe me.
649692 650968 I really do have a bad headache...
651068 653208 I have a very bad headache.<br />My head doesn't--
653308 655308 Shut the fuck up.
655849 657751 You've made a very bad mistake.
657851 659143 Boo-ya his ass.
659243 661063 Ha ha ha. Ha ha.
661163 662342 Cut that shit off.
662442 663927 Fellas, fellas.
664027 667686 Nature boy here hates niggers.<br />What are we gonna do about that?
667786 669622 ZEUS: Hold up, hold up, hold up.
669722 671722 Oh, shit.
675495 677526 Back. Back up.<br />- Hey, Zeus is trippin'.
677626 680662 Back the fuck up. Now.
680762 682085 [Young men shouting]
682185 683365 Come on, man, get up.
683465 685465 Get out of here.
686727 688741 Stop the cab. Stop the goddamn cab.
688841 690228 CABBY: Don't shoot me.
690328 692660 Get up. Come on, get up.
692760 694117 Back off. I mean it.
694217 696788 I don't want to, but I will.<br />You know I will.
696888 699444 JOHN: Go, go.<br />Get the fuck out of here.
699544 700836 ZEUS: Drive. Drive.
700936 702099 [Bottles smashing on cab]
702199 703716 ZEUS: Don't stop. Just keep driving.
703816 705139 Run the red light.
705239 706596 CABBY: Here, man.<br />That's all I got.
706696 708835 ZEUS: Put that money away.<br />No one's robbing you.
708935 710579 JOHN: Just run all the lights.<br />Drive.
710679 711875 CABBY: You got it, boss.
711975 713779 Oh, man. Damn.<br />- That cut deep?
713879 716675 How the hell would I know?<br />- Just keep pressure on it.
716775 718775 Goddamn.<br />- Oh, fuck.
719460 720658 Jesus, right?
720758 723074 John McClane. I owe you.<br />- Damn right you do.
723174 725202 ZEUS: Know what they're doing<br />to my shop now?
725302 726338 JOHN: Chill out, Jesus.
726438 728690 ZEUS: Chill out? You trying<br />to relate to me? Talk white.
728790 730034 JOHN: Jesus, I'm sorry--
730134 732449 Why you keep calling me Jesus?<br />I look Puerto Rican?
732549 734033 JOHN: Guy back there called you Jesus.
734133 735969 ZEUS: Not Jesus.<br />He said, 'Hey, Zeus.'
736069 737729 My name is Zeus.
737829 738833 JOHN: Zeus?
738933 741073 ZEUS: As in father of Apollo,<br />Mount Olympus...
741173 742209 ...don't-fuck-with-me...
742309 744609 ...or-I'll-shove-a-lightning-bolt-<br />up-your-ass Zeus.
744709 746814 You got a problem with that?
746914 749552 No. I don't have a problem with that.
749652 751152 Downtown. Police plaza.
751252 753972 ZEUS: Oh, ho. That's just great.
757249 759792 LAMBERT: Record of all collars<br />recently released...
759892 763933 ...and anybody else<br />he might've looked at sideways.
764033 765535 FRED: Textbook megalomania.
765635 767007 It's a pathological state...
767107 769887 ...in which fantasies of control<br />or omnipotence predominate.
769987 771407 He wants control over him--...
771507 774302 ...over his actions, his thoughts--<br />even his emotions.
774402 776126 Sounds like a secret admirer,<br />John.
776226 778030 Yeah.<br />Maybe hell send me flowers.
778130 779854 LAMBERT: Everybody knows<br />you like pansies.
779954 782606 FRED: Not that kind of emotion.<br />This guy is ugly.
782706 783742 WALTER: How is that?
783842 786619 WOMAN: Nothing wrong with him<br />a shower wouldn't cure.
786719 788573 Beer's normally taken internally, John.
788673 790941 Just give me some aspirins,<br />will you?
791041 792285 WOMAN: OK. Hold this here.
792385 795229 WALTER: This is Fred Schiller,<br />John, and he's a--
795329 797181 JOHN: A shrink. Yeah, I got it.
797281 800524 FRED: Yes. We're dealing with<br />a megalomaniacal personality...
800624 801980 ...with possible paranoid schizophrenic--
802080 803916 Let's skip to where you explain...
804016 806124 ...what the fuck this has to do with me.
806224 807724 I don't know...
807824 810764 ...but what l do know is it<br />specifically has to do with you.
810864 813467 This guy wants to pound you<br />until you crumble.
813567 815547 He wants you to dance to his tune, then--
815647 817371 JOHN: Put on a dress and fuck me?
817471 820637 I was going to say kill you.
821405 823067 He's sitting on an awful lot of rage...
823167 826747 ...and it could be manifested<br />physically if he's stressed.
826847 829114 WALTER: Somebody he arrested,<br />somebody he pissed off?
829214 831258 That could be one hell of a long list.
831358 832666 Fuck you, Joe.
832766 834442 FRED: These people don't like<br />to work anonymously.
834542 836666 They want you to know who's doing it.
836766 839562 This name Simon probably isn't an alias.
839662 841001 It's probably Simon or some variation.
841101 843321 LAMBERT: 'Simon, Robert E.<br />Busted in '86.
843421 844713 'Extortion. Kidnapping.<br />10 to 15.
844813 846521 'Did seven years for good behaviour.
846621 848889 'Released on a state<br />Work furlough two months ago.'
848989 852120 Thanks, Rick. Bob Simons<br />was a bankrupt businessman...
852220 853736 ...who kidnapped his partner's daughter.
853836 856680 He's a fuckup, not a psycho.<br />The guy we want is nuts.
856780 859585 A nut who knows a lot about bombs.
859659 861416 We found this in a playground.
861516 863336 Professional. Very cool stuff.
863436 864775 You know...boom.
864875 867160 WALTER: Think you should<br />slam it around, Charlie?
867260 869271 CHARLIE: It's unmixed.<br />You can't hurt it.
869371 871831 This stuff is cutting edge.<br />It's a binary liquid.
871931 873031 A what?
873131 874631 CHARLIE: Like epoxy.
874731 876119 Two liquids.
876219 878745 Either one by itself...
880632 882006 CHARLIE:...you got nothing.
882106 884106 But mix them...
894583 896583 CHARLIE: Ricky.
898423 899923 KOWALSKI: Aah.
900023 902805 Charlie, you're gonna be wearing<br />that chair up your ass.
902905 904677 Christ almighty, Charlie.
904777 906596 Like I said, very cool stuff.
906696 909029 With a package like this you get a warning.
909129 910772 The bomb has to arm itself.
910872 913636 You'll see the red liquid pump<br />into the clear...
913736 914916 ...before it detonates.
915016 916356 JOHN: How long before?
916456 918180 CHARLIE: Ten seconds, two minutes.
918280 919620 Could be anything.
919720 921764 But once it's mixed...
921864 923059 ...be somewhere else.
923159 925475 WALTER: This stuff<br />has got to be pretty rare.
925575 928179 Find out if any of it is missing someplace.
928279 930435 LAMBERT: Livermore Labs--<br />Theft over the weekend.
930535 932706 Got enough to make another one, Joe?
932806 934547 About 2,000 pounds.
934647 935842 Of that?
935942 937922 CHARLIE: The detonating<br />mechanism can be anything--...
938022 939186 ...radio, electrical.
939286 942066 You could use a beeper and phone it in.
942166 943186 WOMAN: Inspector. It's him.
943286 945010 CHARLIE:<br />Bomb has a double-feedback loop.
945110 946705 A nasty little trick used in Lebanon.
946805 948194 WALTER: Charlie. Charlie.
948294 949298 Shh.<br />- What?
949398 951398 Want to start the trace?
958450 960257 Simon.
960357 961600 SIMON: He wore the board...
961700 963440 ...walked the street,<br />and survived...
963540 964880 Hauptmann Walter.
964980 966816 Where are my pigeons now?
966916 968560 WALTER: Pigeons?
968660 970960 SIMON: I had two pigeons,<br />bright and gay...
971060 972415 ...fly from me the other day.
972515 974143 Why was it they did go?
974243 975744 You cannot tell.<br />You do not know.
975844 977327 WALTER: You mean McClane?
977427 979977 SIMON: No. I mean Santa Claus.
981745 983103 JOHN: Yeah, I'm here.
983203 984543 SIMON: Ah. There after all.
984643 985967 And your friend?
986067 988686 RICKY: Come on.<br />We need you in the other room.
988786 990142 Let's go. Come on.
990242 992047 WOMAN: They need you. Go.
992147 993390 JOHN: Yeah, he's here, too.
993490 995785 SIMON: May I speak with him?
996687 999037 SIMON: Is the ebony Samaritan there now?
999137 1000957 ZEUS: You got a problem with ebony?
1001057 1003997 SIMON: No. My only problem is<br />that I went to some trouble...
1004097 1006221 ...preparing that game for McClane.
1006321 1008461 You interfered with a well-laid plan.
1008561 1010556 ZEUS: You can stick your well-laid plan...
1010656 1011996 ...up your well-laid ass.
1012096 1014381 [Dial tone]
1014481 1015820 WALTER: That was not smart.
1015920 1017996 There are lives at stake here.
1018096 1019676 RICKY: Not enough time, Inspector.
1019776 1021852 You better hope he calls back.
1021952 1023500 FRED: He will.
1023600 1024716 [Chattering outside]
1024816 1028603 Ricky, tell those people<br />to shut the hell up out there.
1028703 1030044 RICKY: Keep it down here.
1030144 1032144 [Chattering]...
1036396 1038396 ...[Ring]
1039149 1040811 Simon.
1040911 1043050 He wasn't speaking for all of us.
1043150 1045770 SIMON: That was unpleasant.<br />Don't let it happen again.
1045870 1047530 So what's your name, boy?
1047630 1048986 ZEUS: Don't call me boy.
1049086 1052186 SIMON: I'm sorry.<br />It was a poor attempt at humour.
1052286 1054585 I was going to send you home<br />with a chiding...
1054685 1055866 ...but now I think--
1055966 1057129 RICKY: We got him.
1057229 1059017 It's a pay phone...in Oslo.
1059117 1061401 They say it's Mexico.<br />- Norway?
1061501 1063625 Now they're saying it's Juarez, Mexico.
1063725 1066153 KOWALSKI: Forget it.<br />He's scrambling up the system.
1066253 1067625 They don't know where he is.
1067725 1070521 SIMON: Having fun<br />with the phone company, are we?
1070621 1072744 Simon says McClane and the Samaritan...
1072844 1075880 ...will go to the subway station<br />at 72nd and Broadway.
1075980 1077800 I'll call you in 15 minutes...
1077900 1080024 ...on the pay phone outside the station.
1080124 1081143 No police.
1081243 1083271 Failure to answer<br />will constitute non-compliance.
1083371 1085527 Do you understand me, John?
1085627 1087111 JOHN: Oh, yes, I understand.
1087211 1089047 I understand you're a fucking wacko...
1089147 1090951 ...who likes to play kid's games.
1091051 1093051 Hardly.<br />- Hardly?
1093051 1095351 JOHN: Then who are you,<br />somebody I sent up?
1095451 1096790 What did you do--...
1096890 1098374 ...shoplifting,<br />purse-snatching...
1098474 1099654 ...cross-dressing, what?
1099754 1101590 SIMON: You c-c-couldn't catch me...
1101690 1104630 ...if I stole your ch-chair with you in it.
1104730 1107334 My ch-ch-chair with me in it?
1107434 1109734 Let me ask you a question,<br />bonehead--...
1109834 1112149 ...why are you trying to k-k-k-kill me?
1112249 1113893 SIMON: John, John, calm yourself.
1113993 1115813 JOHN: Why don't you come down here...
1115913 1118373 ...and we'll figure this out like men?
1118473 1122053 SIMON: If killing you was all<br />I wanted, you'd be dead now.
1122153 1123653 Simon, this is Inspector Cobb.
1123753 1125908 I can appreciate your feelings for McClane...
1126008 1128308 ...but believe me,<br />the jerk isn't worth it.
1128408 1131187 He stepped on so many toes<br />in this department...
1131287 1133428 ...next month he'll be a security guard.
1133528 1135811 His wife wants nothing to do with him...
1135911 1138707 ...and he's two steps shy<br />of becoming an alcoholic.
1138807 1141043 JOHN: One step, one step.
1141143 1142787 Now, listen to me.
1142887 1145203 You sound like a real smart guy.
1145303 1146787 What is it you want?
1146887 1148723 SIMON: Are you talking about money?
1148823 1151267 WALTER: Well, whatever, whatever.
1151367 1153407 McClane is a toilet bug.
1153494 1155138 What would it take...
1155238 1158034 ...just to forget him and<br />live happily ever after?
1158134 1159474 SIMON: Money is shit to me.
1159574 1161377 I would not give up McClane...
1161477 1163793 ...for all the gold in your Fort Knox.
1163893 1166530 72nd Street subway, pay phone,<br />15 minutes.
1166630 1167969 McClane and the Samaritan.
1168069 1169889 If you're competent in the least...
1169989 1171169 ...you've found the briefcase...
1171269 1174529 ...so you know what I mean by penalty.
1174629 1175921 [Dial tone]
1176021 1178800 JOHN: I want to thank you<br />For that vote of confidence.
1178900 1181040 WALTER: I thought it was worth a try.
1181140 1182528 This guy's a raving maniac.
1182628 1184032 FRED: He couldn't be any clearer.
1184132 1186592 He gave you clues to his identity...
1186692 1187888 ...he spoke German...
1187988 1189743 ...he called it 'your' Fort Knox...
1189843 1191984 ...and he stammered<br />when McClane pushed him.
1192084 1195071 WALTER: You believe<br />this guy really can't be bought?
1195171 1199336 The very mention of money<br />only enraged him further.
1205568 1206910 What's that?
1207010 1209728 WALTER: It's your shield.
1209856 1210462 JOHN: You asking me to be a cop again?
1210562 1211582 WALTER: Ricky, get him his gun.
1211682 1213278 JOHN: You didn't answer my question.
1213378 1215054 Hey.
1215154 1218125 You didn't answer my question, Walter.
1218225 1220350 Are you done, Lieutenant?
1221055 1224653 WALTER: You two better leave<br />to get to 72nd Street on time.
1224753 1226109 Joe, they go with backup.
1226209 1227405 You got it.
1227505 1229805 Whoa, whoa, whoa.<br />I'm not going anywhere.
1229905 1231724 WALTER: Simon says you got to go.
1231824 1234124 I'm not jumping through hoops<br />for some psycho.
1234224 1236508 That's a white man with white problems.
1236608 1238924 Call me when he crosses 110th Street.
1239024 1240188 JOHN: Hey.
1240288 1241580 Why'd you save my ass?
1241680 1242684 ZEUS: I didn't.
1242784 1245580 I stopped a white cop<br />from getting killed in Harlem.
1245680 1247275 One white cop gets killed today...
1247375 1249195 ...tomorrow we got 1,000 white cops...
1249295 1253460 ...all of them with itchy<br />Trigger fingers, got it?
1253852 1255852 Get him back.
1256956 1258411 Where'd you find that bomb?
1258511 1259866 Chinatown.
1259966 1261966 Shit.
1261982 1264714 JOHN: Yo. Yo, partner. Wait up.
1264814 1266634 ZEUS: Hey, hey,<br />I ain't your partner...
1266734 1269481 ...your neighbor, your brother,<br />or your friend.
1269581 1270906 I'm your total stranger.
1271006 1273322 JOHN: OK, stranger.
1273422 1278522 You know where that park is at<br />115th Street and St. Nicholas?
1278939 1280217 Yeah. That's in Harlem.
1280317 1282633 Where do you think we found that bomb?
1282733 1286632 Listen, this guy doesn't care<br />about skin colour...
1286732 1288732 ...even if you do.
1290138 1291320 ZEUS: What am I doing?
1291420 1293240 JOHN: Cheer up.<br />Things could be worse.
1293340 1295480 I was working on a nice fat suspension...
1295580 1298231 ...smoking cigarettes,<br />and watching Captain Kangaroo.
1298331 1300331 Come on.
1308857 1311719 KOWALSKI: They're at the phone,<br />But there's a problem.
1311819 1312983 WALTER: How big a problem?
1313083 1315062 LAMBERT: Oh, about300 pounds.
1315162 1316518 JOHN: Excuse me, ma'am.
1316618 1318582 We need this phone<br />for official police business.
1318682 1320998 Honey, I'm a cop.<br />I need the phone.
1321098 1323398 ZEUS: Get off the damn phone.<br />Police business.
1323498 1324662 WOMAN: Well, I never.
1324762 1326598 ZEUS: I can get used to this.
1326698 1328662 JOHN: Find a phone across the street.
1328762 1331397 I'm the only one here<br />on official police business.
1331497 1332837 Don't do that shit again.
1332937 1334277 ZEUS: Let's get something else straight--...
1334377 1336837 ...you need me more than I need you.
1336937 1340181 You don't like the way I do things? I quit.
1340281 1342358 [Ring]...
1345462 1346819 ...[Ring]
1346919 1349174 All right, I need you.
1350677 1353686 [Ring]
1354805 1357299 I need you more than you need me.
1357399 1359925 [Ring]
1361332 1362466 JOHN: Hello.
1362566 1364211 SIMON: Birds of a feather flock together.
1364311 1365666 So do pigs and swine.
1365766 1367858 Rats and mice have their chance...
1367958 1369314 ...as will I have mine.
1369414 1370418 JOHN: Nice. Rhymes.
1370518 1372978 SIMON: Why was the phone busy?<br />Who were you calling?
1373078 1374274 JOHN: The psychic hot line.
1374374 1376674 SIMON: I'd advise you<br />to take this more seriously.
1376774 1377954 JOHN: It's a public phone.<br />What should I say?
1378054 1380594 SIMON: Simply say there was<br />a fat woman on it...
1380694 1383489 ...and it took a minute to get her off.
1383589 1386833 Now, John, there's a significant<br />amount of explosive...
1386933 1390193 ...in the trash receptacle next to you.
1390293 1392609 Try to run,<br />and it goes off now.
1392709 1395168 JOHN: I got a hundred people out here.
1395268 1396608 SIMON: That's the point.
1396708 1398688 Now, do I have your attention?
1398788 1401568 As I was going to St. Ives,<br />I met a man with seven wives.
1401668 1403967 Every wife had seven sacks.<br />Every sack had seven cats.
1404067 1405392 Every cat had seven kittens.
1405492 1407168 Kittens, cats, sacks, and wives.
1407268 1408767 How many were going to St. Ives?
1408867 1410031 My phone number is 555--
1410131 1412111 JOHN: I didn't get that.<br />Say it again.
1412211 1413247 SIMON: Not a chance.
1413347 1416191 My phone number is 555 and the answer.
1416291 1419087 Call me in 30 seconds or die.
1419187 1420255 [Dial tone]
1420355 1422478 JOHN: Seven guys with seven wives--
1422578 1423774 ZEUS: Shut up, McClane.
1423874 1425166 JOHN: Seven guys with seven wives--
1425266 1427406 ZEUS: He said seven wives<br />with seven sacks.
1427506 1430286 Seven times seven is 49.<br />Tell me the rest.
1430386 1431726 JOHN: A sack with--seven sacks--...
1431826 1433965 Weren't you listening?<br />- What's wrong with you?
1434065 1435645 JOHN: A bad hangover, for one.
1435745 1438189 All right.<br />Seven wives times seven--49...
1438289 1441229 ...with seven cats--<br />Seven times 49 is 343, right?
1441329 1443117 Asking me or telling me?<br />- I'm telling you.
1443217 1446205 Three-forty-three times seven is...
1446305 1447597 Two thousand,<br />four hundred and one.
1447697 1449388 That's what you got right?<br />- Yeah.
1449488 1450684 JOHN: Is that it? 2401?
1450784 1454094 ZEUS: That's it. Dial 555-2401.
1455405 1457388 No, wait, wait. It's a trick.
1457488 1458956 I forgot about the man.
1459056 1461211 Fuck the man.<br />We got 10 seconds.
1461311 1463275 ZEUS: He said how many<br />were going to St. Ives.
1463375 1466603 The riddle begins,<br />'As I was going to St. Ives.'
1466703 1468635 The wives aren't going anywhere.
1468735 1469899 JOHN: What are they doing?
1469999 1471819 ZEUS: How the hell should I know?
1471919 1473595 JOHN: Who's going to St. Ives?
1473695 1474715 ZEUS: Just the guy.
1474815 1476154 Just one guy?
1476254 1478554 The answer's one.<br />- How do you dial one?
1478654 1480058 ZEUS: Five-five-five- zero-zero-zero-one.
1480158 1481977 JOHN: Zero-zero-one.<br />Just one guy's going.
1482077 1484218 Hello, John.<br />- Piece of cake.
1484318 1486138 Give us something harder next time.
1486238 1487578 SIMON: But you're 10 seconds late.
1487678 1489017 JOHN: No. The answer is one.
1489117 1491837 There's a bomb in the trash can.
1496778 1498987 Get down. There's a bomb.
1501898 1504023 MAN: Welcome to New York.
1508106 1509800 MAN: Yeah. Get up. Come on.
1509900 1511900 Come on. Let's go.
1514729 1516854 SIMON: Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
1525288 1527288 Bomb.
1528809 1531638 SIMON: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
1531738 1532902 Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
1533002 1534038 JOHN: Yeah.
1534138 1536214 SIMON: I didn't say Simon says.
1536314 1538134 It's 9:50, John.
1538234 1541190 The number three train is arriving now.
1541290 1544565 I left something provocative<br />on that train, John.
1544665 1546965 Simon says get to the pay phone...
1547065 1551028 ...next to the news kiosk in<br />Wall Street station by 10:20...
1551128 1553844 ...or the number three train<br />and its passengers vaporize.
1553944 1556229 Use any means of travel other than civilian...
1556329 1557348 I blow the train.
1557448 1560084 Attempt to evacuate,<br />I blow the train.
1560184 1562644 I call you in 30 minutes.<br />Be there.
1562744 1564004 JOHN: Fuck.
1564104 1567859 ZEUS: Ninety blocks in<br />30 minutes in New York traffic?
1567959 1569492 It could be double that.
1569592 1571891 We don't even have a car.
1571991 1573955 Hey, hey, sir. I'm a cop.
1574055 1576531 I'm requisitioning this car<br />for official police business.
1576631 1578339 Thanks very much. Get in.
1578439 1580738 ZEUS: Pretty slick.<br />I used to drive a cab.
1580838 1582995 The fastest way south is--Aah.
1583095 1586304 CAB DRIVER: What the fuck are you doing?
1586404 1588404 [Honk]
1589892 1591778 You were saying?
1591878 1593634 I was saying,<br />I used to drive a cab...
1593734 1596034 ...and Ninth Avenue is the fastest way south.
1596134 1598259 We seem to be going east.
1598275 1600275 [Honk]...
1601731 1603105 ...[Honk]
1603205 1604993 Where the hell are you going?
1605093 1606401 Ninth Avenue's the quickest way--
1606501 1608001 I know what I'm doing.
1608101 1610528 Not even God knows what you're doing.
1610628 1613184 They're headed east<br />on 72nd towards the park.
1613284 1614464 Wall Street is south.
1614564 1616384 Stop yelling. I got a headache.
1616484 1618784 The best way south is not Ninth.
1618884 1620384 It's through the park.
1620484 1622484 Oh, dear.
1623297 1625727 I told you.<br />Park Drive's always jammed.
1625827 1627867 I didn't say Park Drive.
1629985 1632095 I said through the park.
1632195 1634623 [Honk honk]
1634723 1637503 Shit. We lost them in the park headed south.

1790391 1791731 It's like football.
1791831 1795656 Get yourself a blocker<br />and head for the end zone.
1797397 1798834 If you'd said Wall Street...
1798934 1800115 ...we could have followed him all the way.
1800215 1804178 Wrong. South of 14th Street<br />is St. Luke's hospital.

2254261 2255856 LAMBERT: Get in there.
2255956 2259951 Officer, tell those people to get the hell back.
2260658 2262992 We got a shit load of cuts and bruises...
2263092 2264240 ...some old guy's pacemaker stopped...
2264340 2266160 ...and a pregnant girl's water broke...
2266260 2267312 ...and that's all.
2267412 2270576 How you doing, John?<br />- Still can't hear too good.
2270676 2272495 LAMBERT: It's a miracle you're still alive.
2272595 2274415 JOHN: Yeah, that's the problem, Joe.
2274515 2276879 What?<br />- The miracle part.
2276979 2280461 What are the odds of us<br />making it here on time?
2280561 2281615 ZEUS: Zip.
2281715 2285166 That bomb was going off no matter what.
2285266 2287266 Take this off me.
2287760 2289326 LAMBERT: What's so special<br />About this place?
2289426 2291726 I don't know.<br />Something just doesn't add up.
2291826 2293262 WOMAN: Lieutenant McClane?
2293362 2296422 They're asking for you and Mr. Carver.
2297040 2298283 Where?
2298383 2300383 WALTER: John.
2300879 2305133 John, this is Andy Cross with the FBI.
2305233 2307053 Bill Jarvis. He's, uh--
2307153 2309677 JARVIS: I'm, uh, with another agency.
2309777 2311596 It's good to meet you.
2311696 2313292 WALTER: This is Lieutenant McClane.
2313392 2314956 This is Mr. Carver.
2315056 2318124 CROSS: We got a couple<br />of questions. First...
2318224 2320689 ...do you recognize this guy?
2324301 2325356 No.
2325456 2327725 CROSS: How about this one?
2331277 2332331 Mm-mmm.
2332431 2334431 CROSS: How about you?
2335277 2337387 Did you recognize the voice on the phone?
2337487 2339211 No.
2339311 2344364 CROSS: Did you, uh...<br />notice any cars following you?
2345676 2346794 No.
2346894 2348714 JARVIS: Anybody following you at all?
2348814 2352586 Any surveillance--telephone,<br />house, anything unusual?
2352686 2353705 [Sighs]
2353805 2356265 Well, now that you mention it...
2356365 2361225 I have experienced a burning<br />sensation between my toes.
2361325 2365003 I thought it was athlete's foot or something.
2366570 2368424 We read your jacket, Lieutenant.
2368524 2371304 We were told you would be cooperative.
2371404 2372744 Cooperate with what?
2372844 2374184 We're wasting time here.
2374284 2375688 WALTER: You want to share information...
2375788 2378152 ...how about sending a little our way?
2378252 2380487 CROSS: We want to hear<br />what he knows first.
2380587 2382599 We want to hear what he knows first.
2382699 2385504 JOHN: I know as much as you know.
2385579 2388359 There's a guy out there setting off bombs.
2388459 2389798 He calls himself Simon.
2389898 2392199 He speaks with a German accent.
2392299 2394822 And for some reason,<br />he's very angry with me.
2394922 2398088 And maybe you can tell me why, huh?
2402503 2404213 The first man there is Mathias Targo.
2404313 2405094 The first man there is Mathias Targo.
2405194 2407206 Was Hungarian Army,<br />explosives expert.
2407306 2409605 Now we believe he's working<br />For the Iranians.
2409705 2410725 WALTER: Working?
2410825 2413573 JARVIS: Freelance terrorism,<br />by contract.
2413673 2415365 JOHN: Who's the girl?
2415465 2416805 CROSS: Targo's other half.
2416905 2420164 Rumour is the Israelis slipped<br />a bomb in between their sheets.
2420264 2423172 He wasn't at home,<br />But they think they got her.
2423272 2425572 JARVIS: The second man<br />was an obscure colonel...
2425672 2427492 ...in the East German Army.
2427592 2428804 Ran an infiltration unit...
2428904 2432147 ...the thing the Nazis did<br />at the Battle of the Bulge--
2432247 2433444 English-speaking troops.
2433544 2434723 JOHN: I saw the movie.
2434823 2438467 JARVIS: All we know of him<br />is the GDR medical records...
2438567 2440739 ...show he suffers from migraines.
2440839 2443813 His name is Peter...Krieg.
2446020 2448194 JOHN: That's an exceptional report.
2448294 2451074 What does this have to do with me?
2451174 2455679 MAN: The name Gruber mean<br />anything to you, Lieutenant?
2458724 2460724 It rings a bell, yeah.
2461571 2462593 L.A.<br />- What?
2462693 2465507 That thing in the building in L.A.
2466691 2468545 Peter Krieg...
2468645 2471393 ...was born Simon Peter...
2471493 2472849 Gruber.
2472949 2477090 He's Hans Gruber's brother.
2480865 2481984 JOHN: So...
2482084 2483904 CROSS: Yeah. It's that thing in L.A.
2484004 2487488 We figure he's got you fitted up for a toe tag...
2487588 2491103 ...and he's going to do<br />anything to get it tied.
2491203 2492671 WOMAN: Inspector.
2492771 2494771 Inspector, it's him.
2495008 2498238 JARVIS: Don't let him know we're here.
2499936 2501503 Simon.
2501603 2502751 SIMON: Inspector.
2502851 2506094 Now, who from the FBI is in the van?
2506194 2508030 Let's see,<br />almost certainly Cross.
2508130 2509886 Come on, Andrew, say hello.
2509986 2511022 CROSS: Hello.
2511122 2514334 SIMON: I know you never<br />run alone, so say hello, Bill.
2514434 2517213 Still trying to butch up<br />by chewing on your glasses?
2517313 2518877 Ha ha ha ha.
2518977 2524285 This, gentlemen, as they say<br />is where the plot thickens.
2524385 2526685 I have put 2,400 pounds of explosives...
2526785 2529564 ...in one of the 1,446 schools<br />in greater New York.
2529664 2534348 It is fitted with a timer<br />Set to explode at exactly 3 p.m.
2534448 2536252 Thank you.
2536352 2538076 Your silence says I'm understood.
2538176 2540475 WALTER: Did you say 2,400 pounds?
2540575 2542395 SIMON: Yes, but please<br />don't interrupt again.
2542495 2545691 Simon says, if you attempt<br />to evacuate schools...
2545791 2548091 ...the bomb will be detonated by radio.
2548191 2550011 Gentlemen,<br />someone will be watching.
2550111 2552891 Repeat--one school<br />will be dismissed at 3 p.m.
2552991 2555130 Permanently, unless--<br />- Unless what?
2555230 2557274 SIMON: Unless John McClane<br />and his new best friend...
2557374 2559194 ...complete the tasks I set them.
2559294 2561334 John, are you listening?
2562588 2564154 JOHN: Yeah.
2564254 2567034 SIMON: Pay phone beyond Hope.<br />Tompkins Square Park.
2567134 2569625 Twenty minutes.<br />Go by foot. No rush.
2569725 2571001 If you're really clever...
2571101 2573961 ...you'll learn the bomb's location<br />and the code to disarm it.
2574061 2575545 By the way, gentlemen...
2575645 2578809 ...we got something of a bargain<br />on radio detonators.
2578909 2580249 The only problem is...
2580349 2582777 ...the darn things respond<br />to police and FBI frequencies.
2582877 2586776 If I were you,<br />I'd keep off your radios.
2586876 2587912 WALTER: Simon, wait--...
2588012 2590012 ...[Dial tone]
2592314 2596551 Twenty-four hundred pounds<br />of that liquid stuff. My God.

2598971 2600791 WOMAN: He's doing a press conference.
2600891 2602519 He'll be here in 30 minutes.
2602619 2605399 WALTER: Get every senior<br />officer on the site right away.
2605499 2607127 Don't give me any jurisdictional nonsense.
2607227 2610198 CROSS: I got two kids in school<br />on 64th Street.
2610298 2611766 How can I help?
2611866 2613142 How many men you got?
2613242 2615062 Seventy-five.<br />I push the panic button...
2615162 2616470 I can get 500.
2616570 2618390 When?<br />- Two-thirty, three o'clock.
2618490 2620310 JARVIS: Between now and then...
2620410 2623189 WALTER: We're going to have<br />to do this all by ourselves.
2623289 2625173 Let's go.
2625273 2627509 Tompkins Square Park<br />is more than two miles away.
2627609 2628469 Get running.
2628569 2629717 No radios. Take my telephone.
2629817 2632789 You get anything,<br />call me through the switchboard.
2632889 2633909 Good luck.
2634009 2635829 JOHN: Thanks. Find that bomb.
2635929 2638261 WALTER: Ricky, where are they?
2638361 2641396 RICKY: Right over here.<br />The senior man is Chief Allen.
2641496 2642836 Chief of what?<br />- Transit.
2642936 2643956 WALTER: Thanks, Ricky.
2644056 2646356 Gentlemen,<br />we have a decision to make.
2646456 2648180 Chief Allen,<br />the man who's done this...
2648280 2651955 ...has told us he's planted<br />a very large bomb...
2652055 2653875 ...in a New York school.
2653975 2655795 He's told us we cannot evacuate...
2655895 2658642 ...but he has not said we cannot search.
2658742 2661187 I recommend we get everybody,<br />and I mean everybody--...
2661287 2664402 ...police, transit,<br />sanitation, fire...
2664502 2665842 ...even the goddamn librarians--...
2665942 2667570 ...and we start searching schools...
2667670 2669234 ...and I mean right now.
2669334 2671634 I'm talking about a thousand buildings...
2671734 2674706 ...and we have three hours<br />and 15 minutes to do it.
2674806 2677586 I'd like to keep the media out of this...
2677686 2680465 ...because if they get in,<br />we've got a panic.
2680565 2682385 Are we in agreement?
2682485 2684305 MAN: Come on, guys, let's go.
2684405 2686405 [Sirens]
2699474 2701474 They bought it.

2775166 2776490 For the rest of the day...
2776590 2778938 ...we're handling<br />the department's communications.
2779038 2780778 WANDA: What do you mean, handle?
2780878 2782698 TURLEY: They're shutting down<br />the police band.
2782798 2785034 All calls will come through<br />this switchboard.
2785134 2787367 And I'm going to marry Donald Trump.
2787467 2789321 PAMELA: Walsh, what's going on?
2789421 2791689 Why did everybody tear out of here?
2791789 2793145 RICKY: Pamela, look at your watch.
2793245 2795049 It's coming up on shift change.
2795149 2797448 The bean counters<br />are worried about overtime.
2797548 2799368 Everybody went to punch out.
2799468 2801192 The next shift will be here soon.
2801292 2803496 PAMELA: You are so full of shit, Walsh.
2803596 2805640 Thank you.
2805740 2807913 [Truck engines roaring]

2828874 2831270 City Engineer's office.
2831370 2834430 We're getting an idea of the damage.

2841705 2843589 It's Wall Street, sir.
2843689 2845733 A lot of money here.
2845833 2848043 A lot of opinion-makers...
2848073 2851845 ...the mayor doesn't want to piss off.
2851945 2853945 Is this it?
2856261 2859332 Holy Toledo.
2859432 2861444 Somebody had fun.

2920356 2922175 GUARD: Mr. Vanderfloog.
2922275 2923839 [Alarm ringing]
2923939 2927424 There's a Mr. Vanderfloog for Mr. Little.
2940703 2942878 Go down 20 meters.
2942978 2944030 Come on.
2944130 2945470 MAN: A lot of steam.
2945570 2946909 RICKY: We snapped some steam pipes.
2947009 2948350 It's like a sauna.
2948450 2950749 The subway guys shut down the third rail.
2950849 2951869 MAN: Emergency lighting?
2951969 2953309 RICKY: Emergency lights,<br />and there's some--

2957504 2959133 Speak English.<br />- Otto doesn't speak English.
2959233 2960316 Do you, Otto?
2960416 2962236 Where did we get this guy?
2962336 2964336 One of Targo's thugs.
2965694 2967068 Go all the way up.
2967168 2969168 All the way.
2975261 2977115 ZEUS: So what's up with this L.A. thing?
2977215 2978555 You famous or something?
2978655 2979963 JOHN: For about five minutes.
2980063 2981723 ZEUS: Don't tell me.<br />Rodney King, right?
2981823 2982683 Fuck you.
2982783 2984890 JOHN: You know this guy Simon?
2984990 2986395 I threw his little brother...
2986495 2990008 ...off the 32ndfloor<br />of Nakatomi Towers out in L.A.
2990108 2991482 I guess he's pissed off.
2991582 2994298 Wait. I'm in this shit<br />'cause some white cop...
2994398 2998478 ...threw some white asshole's<br />brother off a roof?
3008315 3010315 [Alarm ringing]...
3025881 3027881 ...[Alarm stops]
3040408 3042838 Mr. Vanderfloog. Felix Little,<br />corporate relations.
3042938 3044278 Sorry you had to wait...
3044378 3046198 ...but there was a subway explosion.
3046298 3047990 It's played hell with our alarms.
3048090 3049430 VANDERFLOOG:<br />I trust there's nothing wrong?
3049530 3050869 LITTLE: No. Good Lord, no.
3050969 3052310 Safe and secure.
3052410 3054934 You were concerned<br />about a currency exchange.
3055034 3056789 We are not a commercial bank...
3056889 3058293 ...in the normal sense.
3058393 3062069 We're...we're primarily, uh...<br />governments, central banks...
3062169 3063477 ...that sort of thing.
3063577 3065653 Apart from the depository,<br />of course.
3065753 3066868 VANDERFLOOG: Of course.
3066968 3070453 LITTLE: And you are in<br />The flower business?
3073398 3075478 Back. Back. Come on.
3099092 3101092 Come on.
3113811 3115185 LITTLE: Oh, no, Mr. Vanderfloog.
3115285 3117681 That's the vault elevator.
3117781 3118928 I'm sorry.
3119028 3121264 Our alarms are sonic and seismic.
3121364 3124400 They don't react well to explosions.
3124500 3127792 This subway business<br />has knocked out all our systems.
3127892 3130704 In fact, we gave up and pulled the plug.
3130804 3132432 The repair people are downstairs now.
3132532 3133552 VANDERFLOOG: Good Lord.
3133652 3134671 LITTLE: Yeah.
3134771 3136879 Heavens to Betsy.<br />If anyone knew.
3136979 3138979 Ha ha ha.
3140273 3144303 But...I thought<br />this was a currency exchange.
3144403 3148143 Oh, I think we go straight to the withdrawal.
3150960 3152960 [Speaking German]...
3161391 3163391 ...[Speaking German]...
3187246 3189246 ...[Rumbling]
3193741 3196363 Hey, Captain,<br />come and take a look at this.
3196463 3198463 Something's going on.
3198828 3200619 MAN: You think you can fix that?
3200719 3203269 SECOND MAN: Just a minute now.
3206124 3207210 OK. I'll be right back.
3207310 3209310 Down.
3213260 3215370 GUARD: Stay back.
3215470 3217470 Stay back.
3248777 3251497 Come on. Come on.
3261064 3262214 MAN: Front desk.
3262314 3265190 GUARD: Get your ass down here.<br />I'm under attack.
3265290 3268405 MAN: Relax.<br />Maybe you'll live through this.
3268505 3270505 GUARD: Shit.
3273511 3275511 Aah. Aah.

3296230 3298531 All right.<br />Let's see to the office workers.
3298631 3301096 MAN: Being done, Herr Oberst.
3303429 3304803 SIMON: And the square?
3304903 3307878 MAN: Perimeter secure, Herr Oberst.
3323267 3326083 [Speaking German]
3341122 3344576 SIMON: One hundred<br />And forty billion dollars.
3344676 3347455 Ten times what's in Kentucky.
3347555 3349856 Fort Knox. Hah.
3349956 3351956 It's for tourists.
3353889 3356673 [Telephone rings]...
3358336 3360545 ...[Ring]...
3362465 3364255 ...[Ring]
3364355 3366175 Yeah? McClane.
3366275 3368094 SIMON: John, you're out of shape.
3368194 3369534 You barely made it.
3369634 3370974 JOHN: We'll barely make it.
3371074 3373374 What do you want us to do?
3373474 3376605 SIMON: What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3376705 3377725 JOHN: Huh?
3377825 3378845 [Dial tone]
3378945 3380125 ZEUS: What did he say?
3380225 3383005 What has four legs<br />and is always ready to travel?
3383105 3384349 ZEUS: Don't you have kids?
3384449 3386449 That's an elephant joke.
3391007 3393007 ZEUS: Whoa.
3393662 3395292 That a bomb?
3395392 3397244 JOHN: Yeah. Go ahead and grab it.
3397344 3398780 ZEUS: No. You're the cop.
3398880 3400220 JOHN: You're supposed to be helping.
3400320 3401404 ZEUS: I'm helping.
3401504 3402812 JOHN: When you going to start helping?
3402912 3405207 ZEUS: After you get the bomb.
3420892 3421946 ZEUS: Careful.
3422046 3423066 JOHN: I'm being careful.
3423166 3424250 ZEUS: Don't open it.
3424350 3427129 JOHN: What? I got to open it.
3427229 3429524 It's going to be all right.
3430299 3432424 [Releases springlocks]...
3437211 3439211 ...[Beep]
3440090 3444089 ZEUS: Shit.<br />I told you not to open it.
3444189 3445721 [Ring]...
3445821 3448152 ...[Ring]
3448252 3450552 SIMON: I trust you see the message.
3450652 3453912 It has a proximity circuit,<br />so please don't run.
3454012 3455352 JOHN: We're not going to run.
3455452 3457272 How do we turn this off?
3457372 3459256 SIMON: On the fountain are two jugs.
3459356 3460439 Do you see them?
3460539 3462199 A five gallon and a three gallon.
3462299 3466519 Fill one jug with exactly<br />four gallons of water.
3466619 3470167 Place it on the scale,<br />and the timer will stop.
3470267 3471446 You must be precise.
3471546 3474934 One ounce or more or less<br />will result in detonation.
3475034 3477142 If you're still alive in five minutes--
3477242 3478422 JOHN: Wait a second.
3478522 3480522 [Dial tone]
3480824 3483158 I don't get it. Do you get it?
3483258 3485258 ZEUS: No.
3485623 3487623 Get the jugs.
3488983 3491125 Obviously, we can't fill<br />the three-gallon jug...
3491225 3493365 ...with four gallons, right?
3493465 3495285 I know. Here we go.
3495385 3497909 We fill the three-gallon jug<br />exactly to the top, right?
3498009 3498997 Uh-huh.
3499097 3501428 We pour that three gallons<br />into the five-gallon jug...
3501528 3504116 ...giving us three gallons<br />in the five-gallon jug.
3504216 3505236 ZEUS: Then what?
3505336 3508116 We take the three-gallon jug,<br />fill it a third--
3508216 3510324 He said be precise.<br />Exactly four gallons.
3510424 3512084 JOHN: Every cop's running his ass off...
3512184 3514451 ...and I'm playing kid's games in the park.
3514551 3518677 Hey. You want to focus<br />on the problem at hand?
3534132 3536946 JOHN: You said, don't say<br />anything if you don't know.
3537046 3539249 Give me the fucking jug.<br />We're starting over.
3539349 3540786 ZEUS: We can't start over.
3540886 3543633 JOHN: I'll put my foot<br />Up your ass, you dumb mother--
3543733 3545393 Say it. Say it.
3545493 3547633 You were going to call me a nigger.
3547733 3549552 No, I wasn't.<br />- Yes, you were.
3549652 3551472 JOHN: Asshole. How's that? Asshole.
3551572 3553808 You got some fucking problem<br />because I'm white?
3553908 3555089 Have I oppressed you?
3555189 3557424 Have I oppressed your people somehow?
3557524 3560304 You don't like me 'cause you're a racist.
3560404 3561488 What?
3561588 3563247 You don't like me 'cause I'm white.
3563347 3566573 I don't like you because you're<br />going to get me killed.
3566673 3569487 Shit.<br />We got less than a minute.
3569587 3570927 Throw this thing away.
3571027 3572591 JOHN: We can't. It'll detonate.
3572691 3575183 Wait a second. Wait a second.
3575283 3576623 I got it.
3576723 3578063 Exactly two gallons in here,<br />right?
3578163 3579918 Leaving one gallon of empty space.
3580018 3581038 ZEUS: Yeah.
3581138 3582926 JOHN: A full five gallons here, right?
3583026 3584846 Pour one gallon out of<br />five gallons into there...
3584946 3586894 ...we have exactly...4 gallons.
3586994 3588046 Pour it.
3588146 3590028 Come on.
3590128 3592461 Don't spill-- don't spill it.
3592561 3595111 Good. Good.<br />We got four gallons.
3595122 3596461 You did it, McClane.
3596561 3598601 JOHN: Get it down there.
3599407 3602061 Ha ha ha ha ha.
3602161 3604013 [Ring]...
3604113 3605740 ...[Ring]
3605840 3608396 Congratulations.<br />You're still alive.
3608496 3609516 Huh?
3609616 3612234 Congratulations.<br />- Yeah, we did it.
3612334 3613996 SIMON: You surprise me again, John.
3614096 3616524 This is becoming an ugly habit.
3616624 3619404 I don't have the time right now, Simon.
3619504 3621963 A deal's a deal.<br />Where's the school bomb?
3622063 3624843 On the contrary,<br />you have lots of time.
3624943 3626943 You have...
3626991 3630251 ...two hours and 47 minutes precisely.
3630351 3633771 Plenty of time to test those wits of yours.
3633871 3637696 Listen, jerk-off,<br />I got a bad fucking hangover.
3637710 3640426 Now, where is the school bomb?
3640526 3641866 SIMON: Temper, John.
3641966 3644771 The road to truth has many turns.
3644845 3648585 You'll find an envelope<br />Under the rim of the fountain.
3648685 3650985 When you undertake the trip it suggests...
3651085 3652425 ...ask yourself this question:
3652525 3656107 What is 21 out of 42?
3657835 3658985 TARGO: We're behind.
3659085 3661128 We should abandon the rest and go.
3661228 3663656 Relax, Targo.<br />There's not a cop for 20 blocks.
3663756 3666536 He's sending us to the home team dugout...
3666636 3667976 ...at Yankee Stadium.
3668076 3670392 ZEUS: We supposed to find<br />something there?
3670492 3672231 JOHN: What's 21 out of 42?
3672331 3675143 ZEUS: Twenty-one again.<br />Half of 42.42 what?
3675243 3677831 JOHN: How many players<br />on the Yankees ball club?
3677931 3678951 ZEUS: Twenty-five.
3679051 3681191 JOHN: What else is 21? Blackjack.
3681291 3682311 ZEUS: It's a club.
3682411 3685641 It's a wild goose chase is what it is.
3688328 3690662 Where's the nearest 'A' train?
3690762 3692102 ZEUS: Wait, wait, wait, wait.
3692202 3694568 Some kid might find that.
3695943 3697943 JOHN: You're right.
3702248 3703462 MAN: Come back here...
3703562 3705557 ...you little sons of bitches.
3705657 3707461 Hey, you. I remember you.
3707561 3709381 YOUNG MAN: Ha ha.
3709481 3711269 JOHN: Hey, where you going?
3711369 3712548 What are you doing?
3712648 3713797 BOY: Let me go, dickhead.
3713897 3715236 JOHN: Watch your mouth.
3715336 3718116 You going to Juvenile Hall<br />for a Butterfinger?
3718216 3720900 BOY: Look around.<br />All the cops are into something.
3721000 3724485 It's Christmas.<br />You could steal City Hall.
3730917 3731971 JOHN: Come on.
3732071 3733251 BOY: My bike.
3733351 3734691 That's my bike.
3734791 3736675 ZEUS: Hey. Hey. Where you going?
3736775 3737955 Yankee Stadium's that way.
3738055 3740055 BOY: You asshole.
3742020 3744020 [Horn honks]
3745380 3749090 Why don't you run over<br />everybody in the street?
3749190 3751490 ZEUS: What the fuck are we doing here?
3751590 3754370 JOHN: What is it that<br />Wall Street doesn't have?
3754470 3755649 ZEUS: You're talking in riddles.
3755749 3758145 JOHN: What is it that<br />Wall Street doesn't have?
3758245 3759265 What?<br />- Schools.
3759365 3760865 And what do they have a shit load of?
3760965 3762965 ZEUS: What?
3769634 3771759 I'll be back in a minute.
3771844 3774592 What am I supposed to do with this?
3774692 3777088 Give it to those guys over there.
3777188 3778368 He's here.
3778468 3780384 Perhaps you could be more specific.
3780484 3781823 McClane is here.
3781923 3784388 He's walking toward the bank.
3785218 3788108 The black man is coming toward me.
3788163 3792863 And after we've gone to all<br />That trouble at the stadium.
3792963 3795551 TARGO: Simon, kill him.
3795651 3798591 Stop toying with him and kill him now.
3798691 3801342 SIMON: OK. So be it.
3801442 3803262 May he rest in peace.
3803362 3805662 I'll inform Karl in the lobby.
3805762 3808142 Pack up your team and get out.
3808162 3809182 And this one?
3809282 3811282 ZEUS: Officer...
3813535 3817105 I'm going to need an answer on that issue.
3821695 3823100 Let him go.
3823200 3825404 Understood. Yes, sir?
3825504 3828348 John McClane says to give you this.
3828448 3832156 Jesus, don't open it.<br />It's a bomb.
3832256 3833628 Another?<br />- Yeah.
3833728 3835068 Oh, I see.
3835168 3836988 We'd better move now.
3837088 3838908 Thank you for your assistance.
3839008 3840251 We really appreciate it.
3840351 3842351 Thank you.
3860092 3863801 ZEUS: Hey, y'all leaving<br />this place unguarded?
3863901 3865901 [Tires squeal]
3883545 3884920 JOHN: How you doing?
3885020 3886712 KARL: All right.
3886812 3889335 John McClane, NYPD.
3889435 3891435 Are you all right?
3891452 3892600 Yes...
3892700 3893943 laundry day.
3894043 3896823 What can I do for you,<br />Lieutenant?
3896923 3899223 JOHN: It's been quiet all morning here?
3899323 3900375 KARL: Well...
3900475 3903095 JOHN: Except for that explosion<br />a couple of hours ago.
3903195 3905462 Seen anything strange<br />happen in the last hour?
3905562 3908342 No. We've had cops in here pretty steady...
3908442 3909782 ...since the subway thing.
3909882 3912694 We were going to make a round<br />on the vault floor...
3912794 3914614 ...if you want to tag along.
3914714 3916534 JOHN: Sure. Think I will.
3916634 3918933 KARL: What do you think of this heat?
3919033 3920373 JOHN: Indian summer, huh?
3920473 3923253 KARL: Feels like it's going to<br />rain like dogs and cats later.
3923353 3925173 Here's one of your guys.
3925273 3927573 Detective, uh, Otto, isn't it?
3927673 3929673 JOHN: John McClane.
3932599 3934809 KARL: Mike, how you doing?
3936118 3937332 I keep telling myself...
3937432 3940212 I'm going to take the stairs<br />Just for the exercise...
3940312 3942452 ...but on a hot day like this...
3942552 3946292 ...it seems I always end up riding the lift.
3971123 3973937 What was the lottery number last night?
3974037 3976337 You play the lottery? No?
3976437 3979217 My wife buys me two tickets every week.
3979317 3981425 Plays the same two numbers all the time.
3981525 3984304 I say, 'Why don't you play<br />a different number?'
3984404 3986545 She goes,<br />'Those are my lucky numbers.'
3986645 3989110 I got the tickets right here--
3991090 3992944 JOHN: Put that fucking gun down.
3993044 3995044 Put it down now.
4000177 4002177 Put it down.
4007153 4009231 ZEUS: Hello.
4009331 4011344 Anybody down here?
4021071 4023181 Freeze. Put your fucking hands in the air.
4023281 4024558 No, John. No. No.
4024658 4026658 It's me.
4027311 4029645 You almost gave me a heart attack.
4029745 4030893 ZEUS: You all right?
4030993 4033101 Huh?<br />- You all right?.
4033201 4034445 JOHN: Yeah. It's not my blood.
4034545 4035693 ZEUS: What's going on?
4035793 4037793 JOHN: Go take a look.
4058669 4059915 ZEUS: Hey, McClane.
4060015 4061515 Where the hell is everybody?
4061615 4064202 JOHN: Simon fucking says.
4064302 4066603 I should've seen it coming a mile away.
4066703 4069802 This was never about revenge.<br />It's about a goddamn heist.
4069902 4071402 ZEUS: What was in the room?
4071502 4073002 JOHN: This.
4073102 4075102 ZEUS: What is this?
4075118 4076618 Oh, shit. Is this gold?
4076718 4078057 JOHN: Yeah, it's gold.
4078157 4079338 ZEUS: Damn, this is heavy.
4079438 4081641 They cleaned out a whole room of this?
4081741 4082761 JOHN: Yeah.
4082861 4084617 ZEUS: That would take a tank or...
4084717 4086717 JOHN: Or a dump truck.
4086923 4088457 Fourteen great big dump trucks.
4088557 4091113 ZEUS: We almost got hit by a dump truck.
4091213 4092552 Damn. Slow down.
4092652 4093993 JOHN: Put that shit down.
4094093 4095273 ZEUS: No fucking way.
4095373 4096552 JOHN: They ain't gonna let you keep it.
4096652 4097672 ZEUS: We'll see.
4097772 4099772 JOHN: We'll need a car.
4105161 4106375 Can you hot-wire this?
4106475 4108775 Of course I can.<br />I'm an electrician.
4108875 4110887 Only problem is...
4110987 4112987 ...[Motor starts]...
4113801 4116103 ...takes too fucking long.
4116203 4118203 [Tires squeal]...
4121480 4123014 ...[Horn honks]...
4123114 4125114 ...[Tires screech]
4127527 4128902 JOHN: Not on the bridge.
4129002 4131623 Down there, McClane. The FDR.
4134600 4137669 Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
4137769 4138885 Oh, shit.
4138985 4140005 What?
4140105 4141189 Shot the phone.
4141289 4144293 Aw, too bad.<br />What's 21 out of 42?
4144393 4145893 I don't have a clue.
4145993 4147109 What about Yankee stadium?
4147209 4149124 We'll get there,<br />After we stop him.
4149224 4151044 [Horn honks]<br />- Jesus Christ.
4151144 4153572 Who do you think you are, lady--<br />Hillary Clinton?
4153672 4156132 That's it. Clinton.<br />The 42nd president.
4156232 4157731 She'd be the 43rd president.
4157831 4160131 All right, all right,<br />But who's the 21st?
4160231 4162051 I don't know.<br />- You don't know?
4162151 4163332 No. Do you know?
4163432 4165603 No.<br />- Well?
4165703 4167459 This engine's shit. Step on it.
4167559 4168707 It's a Yugo.
4168807 4171527 It's built for economy,<br />not speed.
4172708 4174243 Whoa. What are you doing?
4174343 4175682 Getting us another phone.
4175782 4177346 [Horn honks]...
4177446 4178466 ...[Screech]
4178566 4181090 ZEUS: Wait, wait.
4181190 4182690 Who was the 21st president?
4182790 4184790 MAN: Go fuck yourself.
4186436 4187649 That guy was pissed.
4187749 4190145 He'll feel better when he looks<br />in the backseat.
4190245 4192065 Shit, that was my gold bar.
4192165 4194785 This is McClane.<br />Get me Inspector Walter Cobb.
4194885 4196385 Where the hell are you?
4196485 4198305 JOHN: It's not revenge. It's a heist.
4198405 4200224 There's gold in the Federal Reserve.
4200324 4202240 They took a shit load of it.
4202340 4203616 They're headed north in dump trucks.
4203716 4204736 WALTER: Have you been drinking?
4204836 4206240 Not since this morning.
4206340 4208608 There's a lot of dump trucks northbound...
4208708 4210368 ...on the FDR at about 70th.
4210468 4212576 Close the bridge<br />and get some helicopters there.
4212676 4214496 I couldn't close a hot dog stand now.
4214596 4217087 I'm spread all over.<br />What about this damn bomb?
4217187 4220255 It's got something to do<br />with the 21st president.
4220355 4222111 John, John, the 21stwhat?
4222211 4223231 Walter.
4223331 4226015 Shit. Goddamn cellular fucking phones.
4226115 4227614 WALTER:<br />Reach Munsen on the Triborough.
4227714 4230990 Tell him to close<br />all the bridges north of 59th.
4231090 4233246 Looking for dump trucks.<br />- Dump trucks?
4233346 4235166 McClane says there are dump trucks...
4235266 4238014 ...headed up the FDR loaded with gold.
4238114 4240830 KOWALSKI: They don't allow<br />Dump trucks on the FDR.
4240930 4242269 Connie.<br />- All right.
4242369 4244685 I won't argue,<br />no matter how stupid it is.
4244785 4247517 WALTER: K-9. Check out the boiler room.
4247617 4248957 Find anything, Charlie?
4249057 4251357 CHARLIE: I could spend a week<br />here with an X-ray machine...
4251457 4253276 ...and still not find it.
4253376 4254525 WALTER: You've got five minutes.
4254625 4256540 Then we're moving up to 86th Street.
4256640 4258460 CHARLIE: Going as fast as we can.
4258560 4259580 LAMBERT: What's up?
4259680 4261180 WALTER: McClane was mentioning<br />something...
4261280 4263420 ...about the Federal Reserve building.
4263520 4265868 Isn't that near that Wall Street bomb site?
4265968 4267968 LAMBERT: Yeah.
4272925 4275131 MAN: How long do you want us<br />to stay here?
4275231 4277691 TARGO: The men at the stadium.<br />Stay or go?
4277791 4280091 SIMON: Karl should've checked in by now.
4280191 4282191 TARGO: Moment.

4297949 4298969 ...[Dialing]...
4299069 4301977 ...he won't be talking to anyone.
4302077 4303865 It's the next turnoff.
4303965 4306680 Hi. It's Elvis Duran.<br />You're on the air.
4306780 4310040 SIMON: First, I want to say<br />what a great show you got.
4310140 4312440 I listen to you all the time.
4312540 4314040 ELVIS: Thanks. What's on your mind?
4314140 4315960 SIMON: Those cop cars speeding<br />around everywhere--...
4316060 4317368 ...know what they're up to?
4317468 4319763 There's a bomb in a school.
4319836 4321175 My cousin's a cop.
4321275 4324439 Somebody put a big bomb<br />in a school somewhere.
4324539 4326359 Only they don't know which one.
4326459 4328279 So they're searching all of them.
4328379 4329719 MAN: Shh. Shh.
4329819 4332087 SIMON: Every school<br />in the metropolitan area.
4332187 4334187 MAN: Holy shit.

4344760 4346166 ZEUS: They're gone.
4346266 4347542 What?<br />- They're gone.
4347642 4349142 JOHN: Who is this guy--Houdini?

4377813 4380703 In the truck.<br />Let me see the hands.
4380727 4382727 Put them on the door.
4386836 4388083 DRIVER: Don't kill me.
4388183 4390183 Don't shoot me.
4390612 4391762 JOHN: Truck driver?
4391862 4394994 DRIVER: No, I'm a beautician.<br />Of course I'm a truck driver.
4395094 4396978 Where you taking this truck?
4397078 4398738 The aqueduct.
4398838 4401458 Why you taking this to the race track?
4401558 4404657 No, the aqueduct.<br />The--the water aqueduct.
4404757 4406757 Aqueduct?
4407890 4409745 DRIVER: See? Goes from here...

4412501 4413521 What does?
4413621 4414497 DRIVER: That. The water pipe.<br />Goes for about 60 miles.
4414597 4419017 DRIVER: That. The water pipe.<br />Goes for about 60 miles.
4423314 4424896 You the foreman?<br />- Yeah.
4424996 4429199 NYPD. Any dump trucks come<br />through here last few minutes?
4429299 4431360 MAN: I'm writing those fucking clowns up.
4431460 4433631 They better pay attention to work orders.
4433731 4434783 What happened?
4434883 4436991 A dozen idiots tore ass up the tube.
4437091 4440047 We're not loading there anymore.<br />We're loading over here.
4440147 4441967 So much for bridges and helicopters.
4442067 4444383 Got a map showing<br />where this tunnel goes?
4444483 4446483 MAN: Yeah, right here.
4446864 4448862 We run pretty much up under the saw mill...
4448962 4451262 ...till you get up to the Coffer Dam.
4451362 4454078 From there, we've already<br />Brought the reservoir water in.
4454178 4456350 Any way in or out of there?
4456450 4458285 There's vent shafts every two miles.
4458385 4459901 I mean with a truck.
4460001 4462781 MAN: At the Coffer Dam.<br />You can get a truck in.
4462881 4464077 Just follow Saw Mill Parkway.
4464177 4465533 It's about 20 miles.
4465633 4467437 I'll meet you there.
4467537 4469116 What am I doing?
4469216 4470909 You're going up to Yankee stadium.
4471009 4472156 McClane.
4472256 4474092 Go. We got less than two hours.
4474192 4476192 Goddamn it.
4480686 4482876 Hey. Is something wrong?
4482976 4485291 DRIVER: Four hundred eighty<br />yards of rock moved so far.
4485391 4487675 That's ten times the Hoover Dam.
4487775 4491175 There's 516feet of rock above our heads.
4491231 4494843 This part is phase three of tunnel three.
4494943 4497018 Planning began back in 1954...
4497118 4499034 ...but construction didn't<br />begin till June 1970.
4499134 4502378 Know what the most interesting<br />part of tunnel three is?
4502478 4503674 What's that, Jerry?
4503774 4506324 JERRY: The valves. Each one...
4511755 4515337 JERRY:...main departure<br />from tunnel is one and two.
4515437 4516313 [Honks horn]
4516413 4517417 Come on.
4517517 4519353 What a place to break down.
4519453 4521993 JOHN: Hold it.<br />Let me have your hard hat.
4522093 4523113 You got a jacket?
4523213 4524617 JERRY: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Here.
4524717 4526616 JOHN: Wait here a minute.
4526716 4529912 MAN: Wait until he gets alongside the door.
4530012 4531016 JOHN: Hey. Fellas.
4531116 4533368 Mickey O'Brien,<br />aqueduct security.
4533468 4535064 We got a report of a guy coming through...
4535164 4537164 ...with eight reindeer.
4543497 4546327 Yeah, they said he was a jolly old fat guy...
4546427 4547911 ...with a snowy white beard.
4548011 4549527 Cute red and white suit.
4549627 4552432 I'm surprised you didn't see him.
4553896 4557126 What's with you guys and these phones?
4558024 4560024 Give me something.
4560456 4563590 JERRY: Holy shit. Is that guy dead?
4563690 4565669 JOHN: Yes, Jerry. I'm afraid he is.
4565769 4567045 JERRY: Jesus Christ.
4567145 4571381 JOHN: I want you to get a hold<br />of a guy named Cobb.
4571481 4572645 Walter Cobb. C-O-B-B.
4572745 4574581 He's head of my police unit.
4574681 4575828 Get him down here.
4575928 4578196 Tell him you were with John McClane.
4578296 4580324 Ask him who the 21st president was.
4580424 4583748 Chester A. Arthur.<br />- What?
4583848 4586004 JERRY: Chester A. Arthur.<br />1881 to 1885.
4586104 4587748 Nominated vice president in 1880.
4587848 4591586 Did you know he was collector<br />of customs here in New York?
4591686 4593939 JOHN: No, I didn't know that, Jerry.
4594039 4596039 Take care of yourself.
4647585 4649119 [Speaking German]...
4649219 4651219 ...[Speaking German]
4657088 4659422 LAMBERT: We got to release<br />these traffic guys.
4659522 4661982 WALTER: No. Traffic jams<br />we can take care of later.
4662082 4663406 What's wrong with this?
4663506 4664574 Frequencies are jammed.
4664674 4665870 What about Ricky?
4665970 4667694 LAMBERT: Can't reach him.<br />Walter. Federal reserve.
4667794 4668814 WALTER: Yeah?
4668914 4671739 LAMBERT: Biggest gold storage<br />in the world.
4671839 4673709 Get a unit back down there.
4673809 4676078 Find Ricky. Find out<br />what the hell is going on.
4676178 4679493 KOWALSKI: Walter. You got to hear this.
4683710 4685405 WALTER: I thought we<br />were going in the back way.
4685505 4687802 KOWALSKI: This is the back way.
4687902 4689068 ln half an hour...
4689168 4694098 ...you're going to have a riot<br />at every school in the city.
4696957 4699788 WALTER: Start at<br />the top floor--20 men per floor.
4699888 4701995 Send 50 to the basement with us.
4702095 4703275 What about McClane?
4703375 4705643 WOMAN: Not a word. Just a busy signal.
4705743 4708939 CHARLIE: Isn't this putting<br />all our eggs in one basket?
4709039 4710203 What if McClane's wrong?
4710303 4712187 LAMBERT: Walter.<br />This is Principal Martinez.
4712287 4714747 Inspector Cobb.<br />- How do you do, Inspector?
4714847 4716954 WALTER: Principal, I don't want<br />to alarm your children.
4717054 4718938 Move them all into the auditorium...
4719038 4721038 ...and keep them calm.
4737690 4739528 TARGO: We're coming to the dam.
4739628 4742008 You can call the rear guard.
4746361 4749676 SIMON: Rear guard,<br />you can close up now.
4750170 4753740 We've reached the dam.<br />You can come up now.
4754041 4756729 Nils, you can close in now.
4757849 4758839 Nils.
4758939 4761335 Attention, attention.<br />Nils is dead.
4761435 4763415 I repeat.<br />Nils is dead, fuckhead.
4763515 4764631 So's his pal...
4764731 4767670 ...and those four guys<br />from the East German all-stars--...
4767770 4768950 ...your boys at the bank--...
4769050 4770423 ...they'll be a little late.
4770523 4772523 John.
4773176 4775494 In the back of the truck you're driving...
4775594 4777878 ...there's $13 billion worth in gold bullion.
4777978 4780309 Would a deal be out of the question?
4780409 4782405 JOHN: I got a deal for you.
4782505 4783669 Crawl out of hiding...
4783769 4786117 ...and I'll drive this truck up your ass.
4786217 4788567 How colourful.
4794262 4796597 TARGO: I told you not to toy with him.
4796697 4799842 SIMON: Thank you. That's very helpful.
4801494 4804451 TARGO: You jeopardized<br />the mission and the contract.
4804551 4806372 Ivan. [Speaking German]
4806472 4808771 Herr Vogle will help me reach the ship.
4808871 4811591 I'm going to put an end to this.
4812501 4814501 Stop.
4816981 4818995 Targo. Targo.
4819095 4821095 Here. Come here.
4822100 4823410 We blow the dam.
4823510 4824530 TARGO: What?
4824630 4825968 SIMON: We drown him.
4826068 4828068 [Speaking German]
4833556 4835556 MAN: Up there.
4837204 4838673 KOWALSKI: Walter.
4838773 4839921 LAMBERT: Look at this.
4840021 4843857 Janitor said this was delivered<br />this morning.
4843957 4845297 Not hooked up.
4845397 4846417 WALTER: Yeah?
4846517 4849577 LAMBERT: Now take a look at the front.
4850995 4854225 We drill the hinges.<br />Get everybody out.
4878928 4880928 Unh.
4886319 4887821 Unh...
4887921 4889921 Unh.
4907406 4909806 [Rumbling]
4966986 4968680 Whoa...
4968780 4970780 Whoa.
4982312 4984312 Aah.
4989320 4990886 Aah.
4990986 4992986 Uhh.
4997991 4999046 ZEUS: McClane.
4999146 5000965 [Gasping]
5001065 5002693 McClane.
5002793 5003973 JOHN: Where are you?
5004073 5005093 ZEUS: Over here.
5005193 5008645 Hell of a way of flagging somebody down.
5008745 5009829 Did you go to Yankee stadium?
5009929 5011332 Yeah. There's nobody there.
5011432 5012772 You didn't see nobody?
5012872 5014660 Nobody was following you?
5014760 5015940 He's jerking us around.
5016040 5018276 [Gunshots]
5018376 5019780 ZEUS: Come on. Come on.
5019880 5021412 JOHN: Holy shit.
5021512 5023512 Go. Go. Go.
5026885 5028707 It's not rigged.
5028807 5030807 Pull it.
5031653 5033956 [Beeping]
5040612 5043586 Well, I'd say you could call off your search.
5043686 5045250 WALTER: Can you stop it?
5045350 5047394 CHARLIE: I shouldn't even touch it.
5047494 5050050 Who knows what booby traps<br />this thing's got?
5050150 5051394 What about the code?
5051494 5052481 No word.
5052581 5053922 When do we evacuate?
5054022 5057121 Simon says he sees one kid<br />leave the building--boom.
5057221 5060001 We can't stand here with<br />Our thumb up our ass...
5060101 5063076 ...waiting for this thing to blow up.
5068802 5069728 ZEUS: Shit.
5069828 5071840 JOHN: Keep your head down.
5071940 5073940 Hold it steady.
5077346 5078431 JOHN: Go. Go.
5078531 5079775 They're in our way.
5079875 5081875 Go around them.
5093536 5096158 I found out who's the 21st president--...
5096258 5097566 ...some guy named Arthur.
5097666 5099006 Chester A. Arthur?
5099106 5100638 Chester A. Arthur elementary school?
5100738 5101758 JOHN: That's it.
5101858 5105150 [Singing]...gently down the stream.
5105250 5107837 Merrily, merrily,<br />merrily, merrily.
5107937 5110239 Life is but a dream.
5119102 5121102 [Whispering]
5124797 5125948 MARTINEZ: Hi, kids.
5126048 5128892 I know you usually have<br />assembly on Fridays...
5128992 5130332 ...but today is special.
5130432 5133212 Mr. Lambert here is from the fire department.
5133312 5137647 Today he wants us to practice<br />a brand-new fire drill.
5137695 5140075 I want you to divide in half.
5140127 5144347 Half of you go over here<br />and line up against the wall.
5144447 5146683 The other half go in this direction.
5146783 5149370 Do it very quietly and very quickly.
5149470 5150650 Everybody up, please.
5150750 5152090 Teachers, please help them.
5152190 5153434 OLDER BOY: Fire drill, my ass.
5153534 5154746 He ain't from the fire department.
5154846 5157402 Maybe it's because of the radio.
5157502 5160409 You mean,<br />like they're after us?
5160509 5161849 Tommy squealed on us.
5161949 5163289 OLDER BOY: No, he didn't.
5163389 5165389 Come on.
5165595 5167595 Where you going?
5169626 5171001 Let me drive.
5171101 5171961 ZEUS: Go. Go.
5172061 5174061 JOHN: Goddamn it.
5174490 5176184 Why didn't you tell me before?
5176284 5178104 Of course he put the bomb in that school.
5178204 5179224 Why would he do that?
5179324 5181874 To get your complete attention.
5185177 5187224 Find the fuse panel.
5187324 5188343 What?
5188443 5189783 JOHN: Where's the fuse panel?
5189883 5191703 Pull out the antilock-brakes fuse.
5191803 5192951 ZEUS: Which one is it?
5193051 5194327 JOHN: Yank them all out.
5194427 5196427 Put your head down.
5196443 5198999 Put your head fucking down.
5199099 5200439 Listen to me.
5200539 5203640 Hang the fuck on, all right?
5227894 5230196 What the fuck happened?
5230296 5232788 You got a Triple-A card?
5232888 5234164 MARTINEZ: Keep moving. Keep moving.
5234264 5237540 I've got the janitors making<br />a last sweep of the building.
5237640 5240360 WALTER: Thank you, Miss Martinez.
5255220 5256402 Come on.
5256502 5257762 [Laughing]
5257862 5261092 All right.<br />Three's and nine's are wild.
5261190 5263400 JOHN: Stay down. Stay low.
5271187 5273779 ZEUS: Oh, man.
5276882 5278720 What are you doing?<br />- Interrogating him.
5278820 5280673 ZEUS: What's he gonna say, 'I'm dead'?
5280773 5283008 JOHN: I won't know till I ask him.
5283108 5285728 See if there's aspirin in that glove box.
5285828 5288018 No way. You do it.
5293905 5295135 Ten quarters.
5295235 5297407 The guy in the dump truck had 10 quarters.
5297507 5298527 Exactly 10 quarters.
5298627 5301455 Maybe they were making<br />long-distance phone calls.
5301555 5302575 No.
5302675 5304031 They're for the bridge.
5304131 5306960 It's for the toll on the bridge.
5308592 5309614 ZEUS: There. There.
5309714 5312030 Down on the wharf. Dump trucks.
5312130 5313950 Right there. Right there.
5314050 5315390 [Horn honks]
5315490 5319214 JOHN: They got it loaded on a ship already.
5319314 5320606 ZEUS: Shit.
5320706 5322541 How about the Coast Guard?
5322641 5323965 JOHN: Take them an hour to get here.
5324065 5325789 ZEUS: Shit.
5325889 5327165 We can jump.
5327265 5328141 JOHN: What?
5328241 5330589 It's 100feet down to the deck.
5330689 5332621 ZEUS: But not to the crane.
5332721 5335068 JOHN: The cables would cut you in half.
5335168 5336860 ZEUS: I can make it.
5336960 5340870 JOHN: Get down.<br />Look in the car for some gloves.
5342669 5344284 CHARLIE: Six booby traps...
5344384 5345740 ...four dead ends...
5345840 5349495 ...[Singing] and a partridge in a pear tree.
5352333 5354683 OK, honey...
5354783 5356783 let's dance.
5356799 5358523 LAMBERT: We're going to have a race.
5358623 5360938 When I say 'Go,' run like crazy.
5361038 5363323 Follow the police officer and the fireman.
5363423 5366202 Walter, we're cutting this a little thin.
5366302 5368122 WALTER: No. We're going to wait.
5368222 5370457 McClane still may get the code.
5370557 5372570 [Horn blows]
5372670 5374233 JOHN: Line me up with that crane.
5374333 5375545 ZEUS: Right there.
5375645 5377645 You're OK.
5379019 5380905 JOHN: This will take a miracle.
5381005 5383431 ZEUS: Keep your fingers crossed.
5383531 5385113 ZEUS: You almost got it.
5385213 5386937 Yeah. All right.
5387037 5389400 JOHN: Where you going?<br />You in a hurry?
5389500 5392050 ZEUS: I'm going first this time.
5392458 5395174 OFFICER: We have the intercom rigged, sir.
5395274 5396536 KOWALSKI: Walter, the kids may be fine...
5396636 5399320 ...but you wait much longer,<br />and I'll pee in my pants.
5399420 5401320 WALTER: We're going to wait, Connie.
5401420 5403420 Six more minutes.
5417064 5419158 ZEUS: Yo. McClane.
5419258 5421258 Down there.
5430055 5430933 Oh, shit.
5431033 5433095 Go, man. Go. Go. Go.
5442087 5445094 Aah.
5452902 5455782 Aah.<br />- Whoa.
5457765 5458899 Ohh...
5458999 5463109 Boy, am I glad you talked me<br />out of jumping.
5487747 5489747 JOHN: Fuck.
5490146 5492146 JOHN: Get his feet.
5530272 5531710 JOHN: I'm gonna find Simon...
5531810 5534782 ...and beat the fucking code out of him.
5534882 5536238 Here. Take this.
5536338 5537677 ZEUS: How's it work?
5537777 5539021 JOHN: You don't know how to shoot a gun?
5539121 5541341 ZEUS: All brothers don't know<br />how to shoot guns.
5541441 5545261 JOHN: Sue me. Yank back<br />on that, pull the trigger.
5545361 5546365 ZEUS: That's it?
5546465 5548925 JOHN: Just don't shoot yourself.
5549025 5550380 Hey. Don't be no hero.
5550480 5552605 You find him, come get me.
5567965 5569083 [Laughter]...
5569183 5571183 ...[Speaking German]...
5576989 5578539 ...[Whispering] Stupid.
5578639 5580639 Stupid.
5609978 5612473 [Speaking German]
5619993 5621559 SIMON: You have the autopilot set?
5621659 5622679 MAN: Yes, sir.
5622779 5624779 SIMON: Good.
5629208 5631248 ZEUS: Don't fucking move.
5636504 5639094 Oh, the Samaritan.
5639194 5640630 Give me the goddamn code.
5640730 5641750 Code?
5641850 5644758 Oh. You mean for the school.
5644858 5647153 I'm sorry. I can't do that.
5647193 5649541 You call in that code right now...
5649641 5652917 ...or I blow your sick ass into the next world.
5653017 5655639 If that's what you got to do...

5667541 5669204 You've got to take the safety catch off.
5669304 5671156 ZEUS: Ugh. God.
5671256 5672643 SIMON: See? That works.
5672743 5674805 Now, where's McClane?
5686677 5688692 Nicht schiessen.
5690356 5692356 What was that?
5696595 5699026 He said, 'Don't shoot.'
5699126 5703025 WALTER: OK, Charlie, we'll<br />have to go with the evacuation.
5703125 5704161 We're going to go.
5704261 5705777 OFFICER: You heard the man. Let's go.
5705877 5707217 WALTER: We're going to go.
5707317 5708657 On my mark...
5708757 5711249 Five, four, three, two, one.
5711349 5712368 Go.
5712468 5714768 Go. Go. Go. Go.
5714868 5716336 LAMBERT: Let's do it.
5716436 5718608 OK, gang. Let's go.
5718708 5720048 Go. Go. Go.
5720148 5721744 Hip-hop. Hip-hop.
5721844 5723600 Run. Run. Run. Run.

5730963 5732963 Ugh.
5738513 5740078 Keep going.
5740178 5742178 Look what they doing.
5743568 5745582 Yo. Where you going?
5745682 5747682 What's going on?
5747698 5751438 I see you all day, little man...<br />policeman...
5752367 5754381 ...and you don't go away.
5754481 5757796 Yeah, I'm that fucking Energizer Bunny.
5759407 5761532 Where you going now, huh?
5764271 5766701 TARGO: Going to arrest me, bunny?
5766801 5768801 Huh?
5768880 5771820 JOHN: I don't think I'm going to arrest you.
5771920 5773920 I'm kind of weak.
5783405 5785259 I knew it was bullshit.
5785359 5786699 There's nobody watching.
5786799 5788139 Time to get Charlie out.
5788239 5789291 Time's up.
5789391 5791210 Give me another30 seconds.
5791310 5793931 WALTER: It takes a minute 15 if you're a kid.
5794031 5797416 Last I looked, you weren't<br />too light on your feet.
5797516 5799532 Oh, my God.
5801643 5803498 Get them out of there.
5803598 5804938 MARTINEZ: The rooms are locked.
5805038 5806377 LAMBERT: Out of my way.
5806477 5808489 Hey.
5808589 5810589 Any one marked 'four.'
5811499 5812873 What's going on, Walter?
5812973 5816628 WALTER: We still have kids in the building.
5820298 5821352 I'm staying.
5821452 5824597 WALTER: No, Charlie.<br />Get out of there.
5825162 5827432 JOHN: Ever see that show<br />The Addams Family?
5827532 5829896 They got a motherfucker<br />on there called Lurch.
5829996 5833141 You think I'll let you get to that gun?
5834089 5836089 Oh.
5837769 5839769 Fuck.
5851880 5853880 [Muffled voices]
5858951 5860006 Four...four...
5860106 5862106 Get out of the way.
5872711 5874085 Where are they, Walter?
5874185 5876185 WALTER: Still in.
5881509 5883028 No guts...
5883128 5885128 ...no glory.
5887077 5890147 LAMBERT: We can jump<br />to the next building.
5890247 5891203 KOWALSKI: Shit.
5891303 5892643 LAMBERT: Out of the way.
5892743 5894563 CHILD: OK. Come on. Come on.
5894663 5897491 LAMBERT: Get them up here.
5897591 5898787 Come on. Come on.
5898887 5899747 Mayday. Mayday.
5899847 5900963 Bridgeport Coast Guard.
5901063 5903063 Coast Guard, come in.
5905348 5907428 [Beeping faster]
5915235 5917235 Come on, kids.
5920803 5922803 Shit. It's too far.
5929762 5931762 No guts, no glory.
5932450 5935168 It's a big fucking white boat.
5935268 5938158 OPERATOR: Please stay on the line.
5951009 5953009 [Ding]
5954336 5956544 Pancake syrup?
5956832 5958872 JOHN: Stupid...stupid...
5961120 5963422 Hello, John McClane.
5963522 5966837 There was never any bomb in the school.
5966866 5968414 Of course not.
5968514 5970813 I'm a soldier, not a monster...
5970913 5974109 ...even though<br />I sometimes work for monsters.
5974209 5975549 No.
5975649 5978199 The real bomb is on this ship.
5981374 5983260 JOHN: Coast Guard.
5983360 5987068 I was telling them where the boat was.
5987168 5989340 Game over, huh?
5989440 5990780 Not quite over.
5990880 5993276 Bridgeport Coast Guard...
5993376 5995580 ...come in, please.
5995680 5997147 They put you on hold?
5997247 6000061 She told me to stay on the line.
6004092 6006075 Oh, God, I love this country.
6006175 6009320 You know,<br />your brother was an asshole.
6009660 6014012 SIMON: Ha. He was an asshole.<br />You got his number.
6015099 6017099 Yeah, OK.
6017852 6019242 SIMON: Forgive me.
6019342 6022147 Would you help Mr. McClane below?
6022206 6023225 JOHN: Ohh.
6023325 6025404 SIMON: Careful now.
6025787 6029657 Now, do you have the communique?
6029757 6031513 Bridgeport radio.<br />Come in, please, Bridgeport.
6031613 6032633 WOMAN: Coast Guard.
6032733 6034073 SIMON: Oh, you're there, dear.
6034173 6035513 WOMAN: Yes, we're here.
6035613 6037752 SIMON: Are you able to record a message?
6037852 6038872 WOMAN: Yes.
6038972 6041437 SIMON: Then please begin now.
6045817 6048152 TAPE: This is a communique from the CRF.
6048252 6050936 For too long,<br />the West has conspired...
6051036 6053175 ...to steal the wealth of the world...
6053275 6055095 ...consigning the balance of humanity...
6055195 6057175 ...to economic starvation.
6057275 6059671 Today, we will level the playing field.
6059771 6062423 In minutes, the contents of<br />the Federal Reserve Bank--...
6062523 6065526 ...the gold your economies are built on--...
6065626 6067830 ...will be redistributed by explosive...
6067930 6071476 ...across the bottom<br />of the Long Island Sound.
6071576 6075146 If you are not in gridlock,<br />come and watch.
6079063 6081269 You going to blow it all up?
6081369 6082709 SIMON: That's the idea.
6082809 6084629 Some gentlemen in the Middle East...
6084729 6087029 ...think they'll make lots of money.
6087129 6089429 See the men safely off the ship...
6089529 6091829 ...and I'll see you on the launch.
6091929 6095634 ZEUS: What's this got to do<br />with killing McClane?
6095734 6097588 Life has its little bonuses.
6097688 6100468 ZEUS: Didn't you say you didn't<br />even like your brother?
6100568 6102964 SIMON: There's a difference<br />between disliking him...
6103064 6105107 ...and not caring<br />when some dumb Irish flat foot...
6105207 6106291 ...drops him out a window.
6106391 6108339 I didn't even know that motherfucker.
6108439 6110547 SIMON: I never invited you aboard this ship.
6110647 6112947 ZEUS: No riddle's going to stop<br />this motherfucker?
6113047 6115347 SIMON: No code, no riddle,<br />no fancy countdown.
6115447 6117171 JOHN: Hey, fuckhead.
6117271 6118770 Yeah, you--fuckhead.
6118870 6122802 Just one thing I got to know--...
6122902 6124466 ...you got any aspirins?
6124566 6128339 I've had a bad fucking headache<br />all day long.
6130771 6132771 Must be your lucky day.
6134067 6135441 Keep the bottle.
6135541 6137541 Right.
6147410 6149410 Where is the gold?
6151698 6153808 He's betrayed us.
6153908 6157053 The containers are filled with that...
6177904 6179952 ...[Speaking German]...
6187567 6188845 ...If I hadn't saved your fucking ass...
6188945 6192717 I wouldn't be sitting here about<br />to blow up with $100 billion.
6192817 6195117 You're only going to blow up with me.
6195217 6196876 There's no gold on this boat.
6196976 6198317 How do you know?
6198417 6199756 I know the family.
6199856 6202892 Only thing better<br />than blowing up $100 billion...
6202992 6204492 ...is making people think you did.
6204592 6205932 Well, where is it?
6206032 6207852 He must have switched it somewhere.
6207952 6210252 That supposed to make me feel better?
6210352 6212172 No. You're not going to die.
6212272 6215691 You know some cop trick<br />about handcuffs to get us out?
6215791 6217131 Yeah. Use a key.
6217231 6219371 You know how to pick this lock?
6219471 6220619 Is this some black shit again?
6220719 6223499 Are you a fucking locksmith or not?
6223599 6225834 I need something to do it with.
6225934 6227594 How about a splinter of that cable?
6227694 6229694 That might work.
6230796 6231850 Hold on.
6231950 6234330 What the fuck are you doing?
6234795 6236874 Unh.
6236974 6238730 Fuck. Shit.
6238830 6240649 How's that? That big enough?
6240749 6242089 Yeah. That might work.
6242189 6244489 I'm going to drop It in your hand.
6244589 6245929 Cup your hand.
6246029 6247369 Don't drop this motherfucker.
6247469 6249289 Get it in the right.
6249389 6250409 You ready?
6250509 6252840 ZEUS: One...two...spit It.
6252940 6254940 Yeah.<br />- Get it?
6255020 6256232 ZEUS: Move your hands.
6256332 6257768 OK.
6257868 6261224 Damn, McClane, I was<br />just starting to like you.
6261324 6262664 Don't. I'm an asshole.
6262764 6264583 What are you talking about?
6264683 6266023 I lied to you.
6266123 6267239 ZEUS: About what?
6267339 6270823 Remember I said Weiss found<br />that bomb up in Harlem?
6270923 6273223 They found it down in Chinatown.
6273323 6276583 That's low even for<br />a white motherfucker like you.
6276683 6277766 [Beep]
6277866 6279686 What the fuck was that?
6279786 6281786 I don't know.
6282696 6285766 Look, it was the only way<br />to get you to come with me.
6285866 6287526 You got a wife?
6287626 6289126 I'm surprised anybody<br />could stay with you...
6289226 6290342 long enough to be married.
6290442 6293062 She didn't stick around.<br />We're sort of separated.
6293162 6294182 What the fuck is sort of separated?
6294282 6297061 She was in L.A.,<br />I was in New York...
6297161 6299653 ...we had a fight on the phone,<br />she hung up...
6299753 6301189 I didn't call her back.
6301289 6303289 How long ago was that?
6303654 6305701 About a year ago.
6305801 6307266 [Laughing]
6307366 6309700 What the fuck you laughing about?
6309800 6311620 You threw away your marriage...
6311720 6313284 ...because you were too fucking stupid...
6313384 6314564 ...to pick up the phone?
6314664 6315844 You think that's funny?
6315944 6318020 I bet you blame your wife, too.
6318120 6320925 My wife is a very stubborn woman.
6323045 6325059 You better stop fucking laughing<br />and undo these cuffs.
6325159 6327075 ZEUS: They're almost...there.
6327175 6328515 How's that for concentration?
6328615 6329635 [Clatter]
6329735 6332645 Oh, shit. I dropped the thing.
6332772 6334209 ZEUS: Goddamn it.
6334309 6335681 JOHN: Where'd it go?
6335781 6336866 ZEUS: Find it.
6336966 6338306 JOHN: I don't see it.
6338406 6340256 [Beeping]
6340356 6342736 ZEUS: What the fuck is that?
6342822 6345603 JOHN: I think I made it mad.
6346563 6349569 ZEUS: Go, McClane,<br />Get the fuck out of here.
6349669 6351794 Goddamn it. Listen to me.
6352771 6354273 Just go.
6354373 6356673 It's hard enough getting through the day...
6356773 6359105 ...without your death on my conscience.
6359205 6361568 OK. Tools.<br />Check the engine room.
6361668 6362848 There's no time.
6362948 6364992 ZEUS: What the hell's it doing now?
6365092 6365920 JOHN: It's mixing.
6366020 6367742 ZEUS: Shit.
6367842 6369600 What the hell are you doing?
6369700 6370848 JOHN: Lean forward.
6370948 6372320 Lean forward, goddamn it.
6372420 6373567 What--
6373667 6376064 ZEUS: What the fuck are you doing?
6376164 6378303 Lean forward.<br />- Oh, no.
6378403 6380403 JOHN: Get ready.
6381025 6382399 Fucking shit. Shit.
6382499 6385119 Oh, goddamn.
6385219 6387039 JOHN: Come on. Come on.
6387139 6388478 ZEUS: Fuck. My leg. Ow.
6388578 6390046 JOHN: Get upstairs.
6390146 6391486 Go. Go. Go. Go.
6391586 6393586 Get upstairs.
6393664 6395704 ZEUS: Oh, shit. Damn it.
6395746 6397470 JOHN: Let's go. Let's go.
6397570 6398718 ZEUS: God damn it. Oh.
6398818 6400573 Run, damn you.<br />- I am.
6400673 6402125 ZEUS: Come on.
6402225 6404125 JOHN: All right?<br />Watch, watch, watch.
6404225 6405405 Let's go. Down here.
6405505 6408031 Aah.<br />- Aah.
6433821 6435195 LAMBERT: How's he doing?
6435295 6438219 ZEUS: I'm shot in the leg.<br />How you think I'm doing?
6438319 6439675 PARAMEDIC: He's going to be just fine.
6439775 6441852 And you?<br />- Fine.
6442524 6444440 You get Ricky out of there?
6444540 6447195 Yeah, they found him.
6448892 6450746 You going to be all right?
6450846 6452266 JOHN: Got a bad headache.
6452366 6453658 Think they're mad at me?
6453758 6455290 WALTER: I wouldn't worry about them.
6455390 6456729 They'll get to you eventually.
6456829 6458809 They're busy with this salvage operation.
6458909 6460745 No. Dredges.
6460845 6462073 Dredges.
6462173 6464121 There's no gold out there.
6464221 6465625 WALTER: What do you mean?
6465725 6467544 JOHN: He took it. He beat me.
6467644 6468984 WALTER: He beat all of us.
6469084 6470328 JOHN: He wasn't playing against you.
6470428 6471768 ZEUS: Fuck that, McClane.
6471868 6474418 You're still alive, aren't you?
6474746 6476344 Well, aren't you?
6476444 6477976 Yeah.
6478076 6479415 So, he lost.
6479515 6482660 Lambert,<br />would you give him a quarter?
6483321 6485321 Asshole.
6489080 6491460 Yeah, it's collect from John.
6497784 6501238 Uh, Carmen, just tell them<br />you'll accept the charges.
6501338 6503633 Son of a bitch had aspirin.
6503674 6505014 Yeah, it's John.
6505114 6506934 I'm hanging in there.<br />Holly there?
6507034 6509034 I'll hold on.
6524118 6526164 Zeus, hold up.
6526264 6527444 HOLLY: John?
6527544 6528564 John?
6528664 6530740 John? Goddamn it.
6530840 6532840 [Cheering]
6556756 6558290 Yesterday...
6558390 6562034 Yesterday,<br />we were an army with no country.
