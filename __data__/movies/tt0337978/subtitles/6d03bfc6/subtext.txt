126943 130565 This isn't cool.<br />Don't ever, ever touch my computer.
198371 201544 The diagnostics show no damage but we are<br />certain that it was an intentional breech.
201555 203196 Are you saying we were hacked?
203207 204982 It wasn't a denial of service level.
204993 206850 They definitely cracked our door.
208038 209892 OK. Open the "Black Eye" files.
209903 211498 I want every hacker in the country,

227937 231734 Somebody thinks they can screw with us.<br />I want to find out who.
257189 258983 Jim, I said no.

262283 263816 - Get out of the car.<br />- What?
263827 265733 - Get out of the car, now!<br />- Don't touch me.
265743 267762 - No means no jerk-off.<br />- What are you doing?
267773 269935 - John, stop it!<br />- Oh, don't call me that.
270049 271742 I hate it when you call me that.
271753 274345 - Do you know this guy?<br />- Shut up, just shut your mouth. Right now!
274459 275449 Dad!
275461 277094 Stop it! I mean it!
277106 279070 Dad? You said your dad was dead.
279082 280075 What?
280707 282755 You told this jerk-off I was dead?
282869 286677 - You actually said that?<br />- I may have exaggerated a little bit.
288118 290371 And is this guy what, your boyfriend?
291006 292026 - No!<br />- Yes!
293161 295086 I don't know, okay?<br />I'm sorry.

297382 299224 What are you doing here?
299440 301328 You don't answer your phone,<br />you don't return my calls.
301339 303093 That is because I am not<br />talking to you.
303626 305498 Why aren't you talking<br />to me this time, Lucy?
305509 306846 Why not?
306857 308178 What? You want a list?
308190 310546 How about stuff like this:<br />You spy on me!
310661 311884 Do I spy on you?
311895 313730 You come over here and<br />drag my boyfriend of the car...
313742 315640 - You said that he is not your boyfriend.<br />- He is not!
315652 318781 - But you said that I was...<br />- God! Just...
320027 322157 You are such an asshole.

335979 339058 - Won't both of you just go away?<br />- Talk to me, Lucy.
339173 341229 I am tired and I am going for bed.<br />Alone.
341343 343344 You are damn right alone.
345346 347100 Lucy, wait one minute.
347111 349041 I want to talk to you.<br />Just wait.
349574 350512 Dad.
351016 352959 When I want to talk to you,
352971 354981 IF I want to talk to you...

417963 420144 I am looking exactly<br />at where you are.
420258 422276 So that's not something<br />that I would turn on.

1238734 1240681 Operational prudence.
1241618 1244808 Think of them as hardware<br />to your software.
1256609 1257943 <i>Good morning D.C.</i>
1257954 1261336 <i>Well it' shaping up to be<br />another beautiful 4th of July weekend.</i>
1261451 1263859 <i>If you've got any big plans,<br />you better get started early.</i>

1279912 1282033 Credence Clearwater Revival.
1282197 1284202 - Classic rock.<br />- I know who it is.
1284316 1286740 It is old rock,<br />that does not make it classic.
1286853 1288851 What sucked back then<br />still sucks now.
1288914 1290286 You don't like Credence?
1290297 1293364 It is like having a pine cone<br />shoved up my ass.

1349589 1353135 When was the last time you tuned<br />in your radio to pop music?
1353250 1354733 Give me any decade.
1355568 1356867 Was it the seventies?
1357134 1359198 Did Michael Jackson still play?
1359687 1361955 Pearl Jam.<br />I'm going back about 10 years.

1364856 1366879 It's called News Radio.
1366891 1370394 I'm trying to see if any of your<br />friends from Camden made the headlines.
1370509 1371361 Hold on.
1371839 1375743 - You listen to the news?<br />- Yeah, you have a problem with the news now?
1375857 1378868 Yes, I have a big God damned<br />problem with the news.
1378983 1380154 Are you ready for this?
1380166 1382717 The news is completely manipulated.
1382832 1385843 Everything that you hear<br />every single day...
1385957 1389475 Is designed by corporate media<br />to do one thing only.
1389665 1390589 Jesus!
1390600 1392183 To keep you living in fear.
1392194 1393445 - Oh fear?<br />- Total fear.
1393456 1395497 Fear so you will go out and<br />spend money on things.
1395508 1397911 Things you probably don't even need.<br />Things you should already be sick of.
1398026 1400308 So that their advertisers keep<br />buying adds on their stations.
1400423 1401937 And I tell one more thing.<br />Are you ready for this?
1401948 1405057 I can do this all day man.<br />I've got days of data at home.
1405171 1406834 I'll drop a bomb on you bigger...
1406844 1408676 - HEY!<br />- SHUT UP!
1408688 1409917 That's good, that's good,<br />be dismissive
1409928 1410968 You...
1463095 1465441 - Are you alright?<br />- No, I am not alright.
1466263 1468425 Stay in the car.<br />You will be alright.
1471449 1472501 Hey man! Hey.
1474547 1476287 How are you doing, you alright?
1476298 1478079 Just call 911, alright?
1481101 1482583 Jesus Christ.
1503459 1505497 All of the lights are green.
1506406 1507985 All of the lights are green.
1507996 1509195 Let's go, right now.
1509241 1510520 - We gotta go?<br />- Let's go.
1510532 1512617 Get your bag hack boy.<br />Let's go.
1514036 1515663 - Jesus.<br />- Let's go.
1515674 1517383 I've never been in a crash.<br />Are you alright?
1517394 1519430 Well it is very exciting.<br />This way, here we go.
1519492 1521709 - Have you ever been in a car accident?<br />- Yes, I have been in a car accident.
1521720 1522861 What are we doing?
1522976 1527166 A little thing they invented back<br />in the 60s, it's called jogging.
1536883 1541301 Sir, Chicago is reporting a<br />system crash in their train network
1544625 1547991 Amtrak is flashing a level 1<br />crash of their system
1548106 1552071 F.A.A. Just issued a critical alert.<br />Their ATC Net just went down.
1552185 1553751 We are under attack.
1555729 1556734 OK.
1556745 1561005 Let's get them outside<br />for a little bit of fresh air.
1569700 1571687 That is the Anthrax Alarm.
1573590 1575621 Alright, everyone out, Now!
1575684 1576717 Now!
1579688 1581040 Taylor, move, go.
1581132 1582305 Move!
1597905 1602630 <i>All personnel must evacuate<br />and proceed to the shelters immediately.</i>
1602779 1604805 <i>This is not a drill.</i>
1604919 1609846 <i>All personnel must evacuate<br />and proceed to the shelters immediately.</i>
1637659 1640386 Take the team and go for<br />the fourth floor. Got it?
1640501 1641807 Masks on.
1644717 1646200 Make it happen, OK?
1646306 1648049 Research the data<br />from these crashes,
1648061 1651375 see if you can ID the<br />point of origin.
1652695 1654449 Begin Stage 2.
1661182 1662835 <i>Hey what is going on?</i>
1662846 1664515 <i>What is happening?</i>
1670371 1672593 They are already starting to panic.
1675865 1677769 Of course they are.
1678337 1680767 They think that someone<br />is taking their money.
1680881 1683690 All of those nickel<br />and dimes they saved.
1684383 1687039 Useful idiots,<br />as Lyman would say.
1688541 1690492 Prep the video package.
1703271 1705583 DC transportation system is crashing
1705696 1708240 And they just hit the<br />financial sector. Everything.
1708355 1713153 Call the Secretary of Trans, the<br />Treasury and the Director of F.C.C.
1713267 1714378 Let's go people!
1714424 1716993 Somebody, somewhere,<br />has left a digital fingerprint.
1717107 1718166 Find it!
1718452 1720270 Is Deputy Director Bowman in here?
1720282 1722913 - Not now it will have to wait.<br />- Not today waxworks.
1723027 1724504 This is Matthew Farrell.
1724516 1726446 I brought him here on direct<br />orders from Bowman.
1726457 1729078 So if you don't know what's going on,<br />go find me somebody who does.
1729192 1730381 I am Bowman.
1736293 1739781 The video package is<br />ready for upload.
1742219 1743027 Thanks.
1743073 1743845 Listen, John.
1743857 1746293 I thank for bringing Farrell,<br />but everything's changed this morning
1746408 1748242 We are neck deep in<br />damage control right now.
1748253 1749629 Excuse me, I'm sorry, Sir.
1749639 1752359 Do you have something to eat?<br />Any snacks around here?
1752474 1754722 I would love... I am<br />really low on blood sugar.
1754836 1755831 Sir?
1756475 1757476 No?
1760628 1765774 <i>As if the crash of the traffic<br />system wasn't bad enough.</i>
1765889 1768839 <i>The Stock Market found itself<br />in a selling frenzy this afternoon.</i>
1768953 1774310 <i>The Federal Trade Commission believes this panic<br />might have triggered by computer malfunction.</i>
1774425 1775830 <i>What we thought to be related...</i>
1775831 1777708 Oh man, that is all bad.
1778688 1780177 It's not as bad as it looks.
1780188 1783326 We run drills to prepare<br />for things like this.
1783927 1785840 - Are these your suspects?<br />- They were.
1785852 1789041 All seven were killed<br />in the last 24 hours.
1790186 1792245 Do you recognize any of them?
1794321 1795270 No.
1795665 1796815 Not one?
1797563 1798481 Sir.
1799093 1800770 You need to see something here.

1876516 1877945 That was creepy.
1878848 1881453 I tried to find more Nixon.
1881567 1882937 Do you think they bought it?
1883498 1884785 Absolutely.
1888167 1889012 OK.
1889023 1891318 I want telecommunications, transports and...
1891677 1893664 Jesus Christ! It's a Fire Sale.
1893675 1894621 What?
1895386 1897458 It's a Fire Sale.
1898312 1899692 Hey, we don't know that yet.
1899704 1901270 It is a myth anyway.<br />It cannot be done.
1901281 1902642 Oh it's a myth?<br />Really?
1902645 1905618 Please tell me she's only here for show<br />and she's not actually in charge of anything.
1905732 1908397 - What is a Fire Sale?<br />- It is a three step...
1908512 1912104 It is a three step systematic attack<br />on the entire national infrastructure.
1912218 1914471 Ok Step 1: Take out all<br />the transportation
1914585 1916647 Step 2: The financial base and telecoms
1916761 1920442 Step 3: Get rid of all the utilities.<br />Gas, Water, Electricity, Nuclear...
1920555 1922248 Basically everything that is<br />controlled by a computer.
1922259 1924603 Which today, is almost everything.
1924718 1927955 So that's why they call it a Fire Sale<br />because everything must go.
1928070 1930074 Hey, listen, what's your name?
1930231 1932571 Farrell?<br />Keep your voice down OK?
1932582 1934997 Nobody here is talking about a Fire Sale.
1935001 1937903 Not unless you are telling me<br />you helped plan one.
1939162 1940884 No man, I'm just saying...
1941065 1944799 We appreciate the concern, we<br />know what we are doing, thank you.
1945298 1946111 What?
1946173 1949311 - What?<br />- Nothing, I said I understand.
1949821 1952960 Hey, they didn't send the<br />girl scouts to get this kid.
1953298 1955861 They sent professional guys,<br />full tactical gear,
1955871 1957401 they blew the whole joint up.
1957463 1959510 Now look, I don't know this kid...
1959522 1961769 And, frankly, I don't give a shit.<br />No of fence.
1961883 1964131 But somebody wants this kid dead.
1964245 1968724 And obviously, it's got something<br />to do with what's going on here.
1968838 1971270 Humler is taking over<br />the interrogations,
1971307 1972738 of the hackers that we are bringing in.
1972749 1975170 I will get you an escort over there.
1975285 1978476 Right? Molina, get this kid<br />to the front of the line.
1978590 1981298 - I want to know what he knows.<br />- Right.
1981300 1985080 If he knew about half of what I know,<br />his fuzzy little head would explode.
1985296 1987302 Special agent Johnson.<br />I will take you there.
1987306 1990247 - Agent Johnson?<br />- That's right.
1990431 1992059 Right this way.
1993828 1997266 - So is any of what you were saying possible?<br />- Possible?
1997564 2000670 OK look, I will tell you again.<br />If you take away any one thing, no problem,
2000785 2003846 but if you take it down all at once,<br />the system crashes, and...
2003961 2005993 Look around, man!
2006364 2010800 Come on, the government has got to have<br />dozens of departments dedicated to that shit.
2010914 2015073 It took FEMA 5 days to get<br />water to the superdome.
2037989 2040890 How long until we get to<br />the Dept. Of Homeland Security?
2040902 2044970 Lauflin, get on the police band and get<br />them to clear a route to the D.H.S.
2044985 2049071 DC Metro, this is the<br />F.B.I., requesting you to...
2051886 2054234 Farrell just resurfaced on the grid.
2054644 2056675 The feds are taking him to Homeland.
2056788 2058634 Good, close that loop now.
2058645 2059808 Isolate the frequency.
2059881 2063935 Locate the vehicles and get<br />me John McClane's file.
2064534 2068991 <i>Brad, we just found Farrell.<br />Stand by for location.</i>
2071557 2073021 I don't mean to harp guys but
2073032 2076593 but have just passed another<br />snack bar and I am starving.
2076709 2078628 - Shut up.<br />- I need to eat.
2078640 2080309 Shut up.
2080321 2083693 Shut up. You have 14 minutes<br />to tell me why you lied to me back there.
2083806 2086287 Did I lie to you?<br />What are you talking about?
2086290 2089257 The pictures on the wall.<br />You knew those guys, right?
2089372 2091918 - I, wha..., I...<br />- Kid, don't lie to me.
2092031 2095645 I am a cop, I can tell you<br />are lying. Who are they?
2097919 2100259 OK, OK, OK...
2103410 2105571 They were my competition.
2108559 2111063 Make the next right onto Concord.
2111177 2112344 They said they were a software firm<br />that had developed some kind of
2112355 2113843 a new algorithm
2113854 2116921 and they just wanted to see<br />if it could be cracked.
2117188 2119905 That's what I do,<br />I do math based security.
2124247 2125312 Here's the thing,
2125327 2129763 the thing that I've been thinking is<br />that if you can do something this massive
2129896 2131547 you need tons of start-up guys<br />to write the software
2131552 2133280 but only a few black hats
2133378 2135384 to actually implement that stuff
2135499 2138537 so then the start-up guys<br />who haven't really done anything
2138652 2140779 - like me...<br />- End up as pictures on a wall
2140790 2146394 I swear to God McClane<br />I had no idea I was gonna be
2146627 2149528 an accessory to Armageddon
2149805 2152145 <i>Take the next left at Lexington.</i>
2152260 2153792 And that's a sexy voice.
2154814 2156862 What is she taking us this way for?
2156874 2158472 Oh, my God!
2158483 2160942 <i>Unit this is dispatch<br />clear a route for two F.B.I. Vehicles...</i>
2161057 2162791 <i>F.B.I. We have cleared a path.</i>
2163291 2165006 - That's her!<br />- Her who?
2165010 2167580 What are you talking about?
2168306 2169383 It is them.
2169430 2172364 - Are you saying it's "them" them?<br />- I swear to you, I know her.
2172487 2175442 I would know her voice anywhere.
2176041 2179828 - Don't say anything.<br />- Keep you mouth shut for a minute.
2180549 2183071 Hey Metro,<br />how's your day going over there?
2183296 2186897 Gotta be crazy over there<br />with all these 5-87s, huh?
2186992 2189826 Yes, Sir, we had to<br />dispatch all units.
2191408 2192942 Yeah you had to dispatch all units,
2192954 2195784 for all the naked people walking around?
2196037 2199946 Cut the bullshit honey<br />and just put your boss on.
2201178 2205399 <i>Lauflin, we are getting off this route<br />make a left here on 14th street..</i>
2213860 2217694 - Officer McClane.<br />- That is Detective McClane, asshole.
2218022 2220689 Don't worry though, we will have<br />plenty of time to get to know each other...
2220803 2222774 When I come visit you in prison.
2222786 2226747 But, John, I already know<br />so much about you.
2226861 2228743 Your address in Brooklyn...
2228755 2233492 The payments on your mortgage,<br />how long you have been in the NYPD
2234077 2237505 and how is Holly?<br />That's sad, you are divorced.
2237640 2240399 Was that tough on little<br />Jack and Lucy?
2241847 2247098 After thirty years, I would have thought<br />you had a better pension plan.
2247212 2249348 Oh and it gets worse...
2252192 2254655 Your 401k no longer exists
2255712 2257741 Tell you what, let me<br />make it up to you.
2257861 2259907 Box them in at that intersection.
2259919 2262123 Shoot Mr Farrell in the head,<br />and drive away
2262494 2265881 by the time you get to<br />the end of the next block,
2265994 2268090 all your debts will<br />be wiped clean...
2268204 2271517 And your children<br />will be set for life.
2271680 2275173 That really is tempting,<br />especially that last part.
2275286 2277362 But I think I'll pass, jerk off.
2279236 2283407 John, you are a Timex<br />watch in a digital age.
2283558 2284849 You are gonna lose.
2285761 2289245 Yes, well the other thing that can happen,<br />it is that I can come and find you...
2289360 2291593 Kick your ass and throw you<br />out of your own party.
2291707 2295453 - What do you think about that dickhead?<br />- Hold your position.
2296933 2298963 He is not responding.
2303018 2304757 Down, get down!
2315500 2317497 Officers down at the corner<br />of Main with Constitution.
2317509 2319664 I repeat, officers down.
2337574 2339572 Come on, come on,<br />get out let's go!
2342080 2343444 God Damn it!
2343841 2345118 Stay down!
2350325 2353147 Get down, just hold on!
2363501 2365533 We have a squad car under fire<br />we need backup.
2365596 2366959 <i>I Repeat, we need backup!</i>
2366971 2369926 This is base, we are<br />sending backup.
2374206 2375304 Hang on, hang on.
2391704 2393110 Hang on.
2409202 2410402 Hold on.
2427420 2429654 - We lost...<br />- Stay with them.
2445362 2447267 OK take the tunnel, left left left!
2463693 2465690 Give me the schematics<br />of that tunnel.
2465760 2467286 The tunnel!
2476486 2478831 Open the gates on the<br />North side entrance.
2486100 2488878 Redirect traffic,<br />occupy all lanes.
2505418 2507622 - Open the other side.<br />- What?
2507864 2509167 Move!
2514040 2515961 Hang on to something!
2552078 2554456 Hey, don't get out of the car!<br />Hey!
2561942 2563399 Stop!
2576246 2577911 Run!
2584765 2585784 Oh God!
2591546 2594448 Don't ever hesitate<br />like that again.
2595365 2596424 Are you alright?
2601774 2605040 - Stay here, don't move.<br />- What?
2605187 2606942 You've been here before John.
2608544 2609769 Get over to the wall, Sir.
2609781 2611909 The feds called in a favour.
2614296 2617916 All you gotta do is pick<br />up a kid in Jersey...
2618030 2619832 Drive him down to DC.
2619963 2623513 How hard can that be, huh?<br />It can't be that hard now, can it?
2624313 2627215 No, gotta be a senior detective
2632154 2633584 think that a traffic jam
2633595 2636978 or throwing a car at me<br />will stop me, huh?
2637091 2638591 Red, get in there and get it done.
2653015 2654766 This is not a good idea!
2693453 2696429 - Don't touch me!<br />- Ok, ok, sorry, sorry...
2696544 2698620 Are you OK? Oh my God!
2701181 2703729 - Pretty lucky shot, huh?<br />- Oh yeah lucky!
2705215 2707470 Jesus, you just killed a<br />helicopter with a car.
2707582 2709249 I was out of bullets.
2712684 2713672 How you doin'?
2713684 2717111 I skinned my knee and my<br />asthma is acting up...
2717492 2719997 Whatever, yeah I'm fine.
2732665 2734046 <i>Red, check in.</i>
2738184 2740221 What about Farrell and McClane?
2741187 2743597 - They are both dead.<br />- Come back in.
2744193 2746157 OK we are moving on,<br />begin Stage 3.
2746167 2748173 I have just spoken to Emmerson.
2748184 2749785 The teams are arriving<br />at Woodlawn now.
2749796 2751584 Very good.
2751705 2754052 Mai, get ready for the downloads.
2760719 2762479 I.D, Sir.
2763725 2765688 Park behind the transpo<br />and we'll lead you in.
2765700 2768076 Man the gate, you come with me.
2774714 2777604 The anthrax alarms only went off<br />across five floors.
2777718 2780672 Below that you will<br />need clearance.
2781239 2783201 I don't know why you would<br />need to go down there
2783212 2786207 there is nothing down there but servers.
2790781 2792673 <i>All clear. Rodriguez!</i>
2794158 2795045 <i>Incoming.</i>
2809742 2812222 - The gate is secured.<br />- Copy.
2821246 2823254 OK, we are in.
2859795 2864104 Hey, this is absurd, man.<br />There is tough and there is stupid.
2864241 2867349 You've got to go to the<br />hospital, look at you.
2867779 2870073 I am not a doctor, but<br />you look like you are hurt.
2870188 2871760 - Yes, sexy, right?<br />- No.
2871771 2872987 Come on.
2873212 2876774 We don't need a doctor,<br />we need the cops.
2903837 2905287 He's in.
2906513 2910496 Get out of the way,<br />look out, please.
2913840 2918780 NYPD, alright, I got this kid.<br />Come on let's go.
2924539 2926206 NYPD
2928862 2930554 Sergeant?
2930573 2931642 Sergeant!
2931869 2933875 I need to speak with you.
2933886 2934616 The doctor is in the back.
2934627 2938601 I am NYPD,<br />I need to talk to you.
2938867 2940315 Just give me a minute.
2946850 2949372 Oh my God!
2954529 2956167 Let's get of here.
2960072 2963011 <i>Perfect! Now the second sequence.</i>
2968913 2970603 <i>The server is ready.</i>
2970888 2972680 We are go.
2972905 2975385 Launch the downloads.
2984926 2986888 Nothing is happening.
2986900 2988349 Be patient.
2989905 2993775 - I don't know, it's not responding.<br />- Wait for it.
2997889 2999373 See.
2999908 3001493 There you go.
3001925 3004012 Let me know when the<br />download reaches 20%.
3004127 3005240 OK.
3015241 3017135 - Excuse me!<br />- Thank you!
3017360 3018546 Holy Shit!
3019953 3022124 Kid? Kid? Hey!
3022218 3024819 - You got a phone in that bag?<br />- Yes.
3024933 3026383 Come on let's go.
3029956 3033413 And here you go, agent...<br />Tavarek. I guess that's you.
3056483 3057976 The download is at 20%.
3057986 3062680 Time to move. Let's keep them<br />chasing their tails.
3077331 3078986 <i>Due to the recent activity...</i>
3078997 3081971 <i>law enforcement agencies are<br />being extremely cautious.</i>
3082086 3086800 <i>They are telling drivers to abandon<br />vehicles, until they are searched.</i>
3086962 3088083 <i>And as you can see...</i>
3088094 3090883 <i>K-9 units are checking each vehicle.</i>
3090998 3093931 <i>Now whether this is connected<br />to the anthrax reports earlier...</i>
3094045 3097097 <i>or if it is a new terrorist threat<br />we don't know that this stage.</i>
3097212 3098801 FAA just grounded all flights.
3098812 3100302 - Good.<br />- Sir...
3100314 3102389 We have complete access<br />over system networks.
3102502 3105906 Phones, power grids,<br />water, nuclear...
3106020 3108027 - Hey, excuse me...<br />- Dan Parry, The NSA
3108039 3110930 Chuck Summer DHS Liaison.<br />The White House made the call.
3111044 3113009 Anything you need,<br />We are here to help.
3113019 3115021 Help? Wow. That's, that's great.
3115084 3117928 We are gonna need some<br />work space for our people.
3118042 3120004 What can you do for us?
3120015 3122117 Well as you can see, we<br />are using the space...
3122231 3124409 You guys can stand in the corner,
3124523 3125464 and liaise.
3125510 3127516 And if I need something...
3127528 3129081 I'll just wake you.
3151051 3153470 - Wait, no no. Don't call.<br />- What?
3153585 3155547 - What are you talking about?<br />- They probably cracked that hours ago
3155559 3157247 if you use it they might<br />be able to trace us here.
3157267 3158435 - Just put in your pocket.<br />- Sure?
3158549 3160288 Yes.
3160540 3162546 Or smash it, you didn't<br />have to smash it...
3163434 3165919 Excuse me, excuse me.<br />This is a police emergency.
3166034 3168049 He'll call you right back.
3169122 3170367 Here, wait in here.
3171768 3173536 - Do you have a signal?<br />- Yes.
3174841 3176058 Yes.
3176078 3178496 This is John McClane<br />for agent Bowman.
3178610 3181019 Sir, John McClane is on the line.
3182087 3183318 McClane, go.
3183328 3184616 We never made it to DHS
3184627 3188930 They came for the kid again.<br />All your men are down.
3189866 3193006 - And what about Farrell?<br />- Yeah he's here with me.
3193119 3195083 - Sir?<br />- Hang on, John.
3195094 3196956 Yeah I'll hold on.
3202091 3204098 Another day in paradise.
3204110 3205557 They just swamped everything,
3205671 3209583 the whole telecom system.<br />Phones, cellular, satellite...
3221150 3223528 They are blanketing every station.
3250126 3253018 - Can you put the news back on?<br />- This is the news.
3253132 3256185 It on every channel,<br />it's been like this for a few minutes now.
3273752 3275658 Oh my God!
3277073 3278101 Shit!
3283295 3284305 McClane!
3286184 3288664 Look out!
3290173 3290999 Look out!
3293182 3295191 Bowman? Do you see that?
3295302 3297162 - McClane?<br />- Bowman?
3297174 3298624 It's a fake.
3302196 3304677 I see it.
3304695 3306180 Thank God!
3309602 3312023 - McClane?<br />- Bowman.
3317734 3321121 The satellite's down.<br />Get me a landline.
3335207 3338635 Wrote one little piece of code<br />and the world falls apart.
3339241 3341836 - This is virtual terrorism.<br />- What?
3342203 3345609 It's crazy, the first time that I<br />heard of a Fire Sale
3345724 3349038 I actually thought it would be cool,<br />if somebody did it.
3350274 3352650 Hit the "reset" button...
3353280 3355687 Melt the system, just for fun.
3356284 3358246 Hey, it is not a system.
3358257 3360738 It is a country. We are<br />talking about people.
3360850 3362858 A whole country, full of people.
3362869 3364317 Sitting at home, alone...
3364329 3366231 Scared to death in<br />their houses, alright.
3366243 3368249 So if you are done with<br />your little nostalgic moment...
3368364 3372365 Maybe you can think a little<br />and help me catch these guys.
3372480 3374046 Just help me.
3374270 3376339 Just put yourself in their shoes.
3377625 3378758 Come on.
3378837 3382266 If this were your Fire Sale,<br />what would be your next move?
3384271 3388839 OK, the point of a Fire Sale is that it<br />is mostly done by remote, right...
3388951 3391630 But not everything is run<br />completely on-line.
3391744 3394676 Major utilities aren't,<br />they are run in closed circuits...
3394790 3396796 You can breech the security<br />up to a certain point, but...
3396808 3401572 To shut it down you would have<br />to physically go there...
3402979 3404539 You know what, give me that guys PDA.
3404550 3406179 The phones don't work,<br />they are all dead.
3406292 3408299 No the phones are fine<br />it is the network that is dead.
3408311 3410275 I only need to reprogram it...
3410287 3413537 And link it into the old sat-come,<br />hackers surf them the whole time.
3413651 3416181 It is probably what these guys are<br />using to talk to each other.
3416294 3418775 How do you know all this stuff?
3418807 3420578 Dude, I don't know.
3420865 3422972 I couldn't explain it to you.
3423086 3424097 OK.
3424322 3425987 The national power grid,<br />gas and the electricity...
3425998 3427274 They are divided in to<br />three zones, right?
3427286 3430950 Eastern, Central and Western.<br />Each one with a primary hub.
3431319 3432769 Here it is.
3435355 3438246 - What is that, what am I looking at?<br />- That is the eastern hub.
3438361 3440323 Now, they take this out...
3440334 3442710 It wipes out all the power<br />for the entire eastern corridor.
3443339 3445346 But again they will have to<br />do it manually.
3445358 3447835 OK.
3448360 3451208 - Come on, let's go.<br />- What, to West Virgínia?
3451323 3453803 I honestly don't think I can handle<br />any more people trying to kill me.
3453917 3456231 - McClane, McClane?<br />- Oh you get used to it.
3456346 3457795 McClane. Oh, shit!
3458447 3462242 Sir, wireless networks are down<br />they are hitting the landlines too.
3462357 3465423 I don't care how,<br />you find me a line.
3465876 3467233 Come on, what you got?
3467334 3469342 We swept the whole building,<br />it seems clean. We can...
3469353 3471316 - sweep it again, but...<br />- Don't bother.
3471326 3472933 Don't bother.
3473404 3476707 It is fake. These guys planned this...
3477336 3480271 Alright get everybody back<br />inside the crisis centre, now.
3480385 3482761 Let's open it up!
3484910 3486291 Come on, get in.
3486600 3491683 The door is locked. Unless<br />you have an extra gun to unlock it.
3493924 3495270 Hey, don't do that.
3495282 3497288 You're gonna disable it... Shit.
3500813 3502028 Wow, crazy, did you see that?
3502896 3507169 Sorry about that man.<br />I didn't know it would come out so fast.
3510923 3512373 How did you do yours?
3514916 3518034 Are you alright? What,<br />did it hit you a little bit.
3518229 3519249 Sorry.
3523972 3525801 Please, don't touch those, OK?<br />I know what am doing.
3526018 3527535 I have done this before.
3527656 3530064 I mean, I have read about it.
3530928 3533861 <i>Road Assist, we have detected<br />an airbag deployment.</i>
3533975 3535939 Yes erm! Please, we hit a tree...
3535950 3537957 And my Dad is having<br />a heart attack...
3537968 3540857 I think he is gonna die.<br />You need to help us!
3540971 3543821 <i>Hold while we contact<br />the Emergency Services.</i>
3543934 3545528 No, no, no! He is dying!
3545540 3547752 Please, listen to me. I can get him<br />to the hospital, I can drive.
3547764 3551312 I am fine! But the key doesn't turn.
3551323 3554234 So you have to start the<br />car for us OK? Please, Dad...
3554246 3556458 <i>Your name, please?</i>
3557354 3559834 My name is...
3559905 3563353 Frank and my Dad's name is...
3566861 3570711 Dvorak Tsargentzki!
3572584 3575413 Please, just help us!<br />We need your help, please!
3575528 3577689 <i>The Emergency Services are on their way.</i>
3578017 3580023 No, no, no! Listen, ma'am.
3580034 3581620 - What is your name?<br />- Dolores.
3581624 3583501 Dolores? OK, Dolores...
3583615 3585003 I don't know if you have a Dad...
3585015 3586250 But I do...
3586373 3588585 And I want to be able<br />to say that a year from now, OK?
3588596 3590455 Because my Dad is my<br />hero and right now he is...
3590570 3592987 In my arms, dying and...
3592998 3594527 And his only hope is...
3594531 3596581 To get to a hospital right now!<br />We can't wait!
3596590 3600453 So, please!<br />Start the God damn car!
3603510 3604764 Thank you, Dolores.
3604805 3607388 Pass the P.D.A.<br />I gotta call the Warlock.
3607502 3610950 - The what?<br />- Warlock, he is a digital jedi.
3629042 3630055 Ma'am, you are not<br />authorised to be here.
3630071 3632778 F.B.I. We suspect there has<br />been a security breech.
3632787 3635721 You have landed without authorisation.
3655063 3659839 - That was pretty good back there, kid.<br />- Thanks.
3660006 3664560 - What's the matter, nothing to complain about?<br />- No, just...
3665961 3669383 - Then what? What's the matter?<br />- It's not funny, I'm not like you,
3669389 3671282 I can't do this shit.
3671293 3676025 - What does that mean? Like what?<br />- Like... heroic and everything.
3677643 3678884 I am not that guy.
3678899 3682550 - Nobody here is a hero, kid.<br />- You saved my life like 10 times,
3682664 3683674 in the last six hours.
3683676 3685767 I was doing my job, that's all.
3688668 3692848 Do you know what you get for being a hero?<br />Nothing! You get shot at.
3692853 3697040 A little pat on the back,<br />bla bla bla. That a boy!
3700238 3702213 You get divorced...
3702557 3708497 Your wife can't remember your last name,<br />kids don't want to talk to you...
3709618 3712509 You get to eat a lot<br />of meals by yourself.
3712688 3715868 Trust me kid, nobody<br />wants to be that guy.
3716686 3721148 - Then why you doing this?<br />- Because there is nobody else to do it right now.
3721219 3722887 Believe me if there was<br />somebody else to do it
3722892 3727124 I would let them do it.<br />But there's not, so we're doing it.
3728577 3731363 That's what makes you that guy.
3739529 3741251 The things flying now.
3741261 3745167 Contact Emerson, tell him that<br />we will be there soon.
3751136 3755283 What the hell are you doing?<br />This whole floor is restricted access.
3780225 3781466 You stay here.
3832288 3834840 - We are in.<br />- Good, shut it down.
3844684 3847043 I guess you were right, kid.
3847044 3849106 OK... that's awful.
3851785 3852945 We got company.
3862208 3864014 So how would they<br />shut down the power?
3864015 3866041 - What?<br />- Come on!
3866930 3869102 Central control room.
3871304 3874444 - Fourth floor, fourth floor!<br />- Come on!
3885543 3886572 Shit!
3889439 3891080 - Try to keep up!<br />- I am keeping up!
3891081 3892957 I am just trying to stop for<br />just two seconds to catch a breath.
3892993 3897637 - They have these things called Gymnasiums...<br />- Well yeah, it's not like...
3917349 3920120 Come on! Let's go! Let's go!
3932247 3935557 Intel is fairly certain that<br />the terrorists are mobile.
3935558 3938919 It is the only way to consistently<br />avoid signal triangulation.
3938920 3940878 Judging by the amount of<br />hardware they are running,
3940879 3943410 we are probably looking<br />for a large vehicle,
3943412 3945716 probably a semi-trailer rig.
3945717 3946595 Right.
3946604 3948254 Tell the guys at<br />Homeland Security...
3948255 3951438 That we need every agent, satellite and<br />functioning network they have got.
3951439 3952467 Now!
3971789 3973475 Playtime is over sweetheart
3973476 3976705 Don't! Take your hand off the gun.
3976762 3979565 Hands up. Stand up.
3986337 3988143 Go on, now!
3988953 3991763 Let's go, kid! You're up!
3994655 3996695 As fast as you can.
4017385 4022120 That's enough of this Kung-Fu shit<br />I've met some bitches in my day...
4022121 4024179 But you...
4028984 4030521 Still awake, huh?
4031144 4033272 - Just keep doing what you are doing.<br />- OK!
4033273 4036505 - How much time do you need?<br />- Not much.
4049327 4050781 Are you done?
4051501 4052736 Are you done?
4052804 4054641 No... no, not quite...
4054848 4058389 I am not exactly checking<br />my email here, you know.
4058462 4061626 I ran this hacking PN mode on their<br />PI, I am just booting their host...
4061627 4064970 - What?<br />- It means about 30 seconds, ok?
4065745 4069337 It is not the easiest<br />thing to do, when...
4080281 4081631 OK.
4083440 4086754 - Undo everything you just did, now!<br />- OK, OK...
4088407 4092318 I'm a righty, I'm a righty.<br />I need my other hand. I really do.
4094075 4095638 I'm a righty...
4128501 4130657 One last door to open.
4131639 4136105 Do you know what you are doing?<br />Do you realise what this'll do to the country?
4136106 4139228 Yes, I do. Now open the door.
4139449 4143831 Ok, good. Glad we are<br />on the same page.
4168445 4170103 How you doin'?
4179781 4181016 Hang on!
4256193 4258478 Let's just talk about<br />this for once...
4262492 4266510 How you doing? That's<br />not too tight is it?
4268363 4269599 Damn it!
4272593 4274160 Well, great!
4307768 4309406 McClane!
4310898 4312305 Shit!
4313452 4315250 McClane, get out of there!
4317166 4319025 Come on man, come on!
4323032 4324475 Come on, man!
4346025 4348394 Did you see that?
4351666 4353517 - So you stopped her, right?<br />- Yeah yeah yeah.
4353519 4356890 Actually having a gun pointed at<br />your head makes it harder to do.
4356891 4360133 - What?<br />- I think she left a surprise.
4363486 4365895 Can't you just turn it off?<br />Lock 'em out?
4365896 4367427 I'm not sure.
4369176 4372542 I might be able to slow<br />them down though.
4374027 4378216 Western and central hubs are<br />ours, we are just waiting on Mai.
4378217 4380263 Hang on, something's up.
4380264 4383196 All of the security is<br />reactivating.
4383197 4387258 I think somebody is in the<br />market for some cheap Viagra...
4387259 4390432 And your girlfriend is dead...
4390433 4393920 Why not check out our sexy<br />singles you can chat with.
4393921 4395740 It's an e-bomb.
4407783 4409309 Alright, wait wait wait, OK
4412702 4416013 - Mai, talk to me what's going on?<br />- Mai...
4417065 4420839 Oh, yeah, little Asian chick,<br />likes to kick people?
4420840 4423873 I don't think she will be talking<br />with anybody for a long time.
4424515 4427075 The last time that I saw her,<br />she was in the...
4427076 4430541 Bottom of an elevator shaft<br />with an SUV rammed up her ass.
4430542 4433598 <i>What's the matter?<br />Cat got your tongue?</i>
4433965 4438282 Listen, Jackass! Your<br />Fire Sale is over.
4439257 4443603 Pack up your little circus or<br />I will come and kick your ass.
4443620 4449797 You have idea who I am<br />and of what I am capable of.
4450028 4452830 <i>When I'm finished here and<br />I promise it will be soon...</i>
4452831 4456431 I will focus all my attention on you.
4457863 4460841 You wanna make things personal, fine!
4480611 4485839 Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas<br />in the pipelines to that station.
4486644 4489793 - Can you get Bowman on this thing?<br />- Sure...
4489831 4492650 - Can get anyone.<br />- Do it.
4492651 4494581 - Now?<br />- Yes, now.
4497832 4499480 Please, no!
4500695 4503260 - That is Thomas Gabriel.<br />- Shit!
4504196 4507705 - You know this guy?<br />- I worked with him.
4508213 4511594 He was D.O.D.s chief programmer<br />for infrastructure security.
4511595 4514626 After 9/11, he's the guy<br />that told joint chiefs...
4514627 4518253 That the system was vulnerable. He was pushing<br />for total overhaul, but they wouldn't listen.
4518254 4521507 - Gabriel is not exactly people friendly.<br />- You think so?
4522270 4526286 <i>When he tried to go public, they<br />crucified him, destroyed his reputation,</i>
4526287 4529106 <i>after that he disappeared.</i>
4529301 4532118 We got a pretty serious problem.
4532286 4533830 Hold on a minute, what?
4533831 4537021 I think we need to get out<br />of here, right now.
4538386 4541450 - They are sending the gas lines here.<br />- Gas? What gas?
4541451 4542831 Christ!
4544125 4545819 Oh, all of them!
4545855 4549380 See that? Those flashing arrows?<br />That is not good.
4549381 4552393 - All that's coming here?<br />- Yes, I think we gotta go.
4552394 4555816 <i>Listen, I gotta go.<br />Just find Thomas Gabriel!</i>
4555817 4557916 McClane? McClane?
4558417 4560826 Let's go, finish this up!
4566450 4569270 Right now, let's go!<br />Come on!
4588931 4590267 Get in there!
4643095 4645531 Let's go, come on,<br />we gotta get out of here.
4645532 4647619 Oh what is the point, oh man,<br />what is the point?
4647781 4652801 Hey, knock that off. This has something<br />to do with that code you wrote, now think.
4652802 4656071 - Come on, help us win.<br />- Win?!
4656818 4659341 When did we start winning, huh?
4659342 4663848 Look around, are you out of your mind?<br />We are not even close to winning.
4663849 4666666 We just got the shit kicked out of us!
4666862 4668084 You think I'm holding out on you,<br />something I'm not telling you
4668151 4670757 If I knew what they wanted,<br />I would tell you!
4670796 4673904 - I would happily tell you!<br />- Jesus!
4711041 4717481 Warlock, Warlock!<br />Ah great, there goes the cell phone.
4717482 4720702 - They knocked the satellites out now?<br />- No, the battery ran out.
4720704 4722780 - Listen we should go see him.<br />- Who?
4722781 4725892 The Warlock, it's not that far<br />away, it's in Baltimore.
4725893 4730125 - You want to go to the Warlocks house, now.<br />- Hey, this is me helping you.
4730126 4734501 Trust me. We gotta go see the Warlock<br />it is our only hope.
4739141 4743776 - How do you feel about flying?<br />- You mean like, with a pilot?
4751191 4753716 - Stick it in the round thing.<br />- What round thing?
4753717 4755685 Here, put these on.
4756932 4759442 Stick it in there, that'll work.
4759497 4763731 - You OK?<br />- Yeah, uhh, I am afraid of flying.
4763732 4766674 - Yeah I used to be terrified of flying.<br />- Really?
4766675 4769717 I took some lessons, you know,<br />face my fears, that kind of thing...
4769718 4772002 - Yeah, did it help?<br />- Not really.
4773151 4774456 That's it...
4777297 4780088 - Is it supposed to make that sound?<br />- Yes.
4782112 4784403 Maybe we should just drive,<br />it'll be fun like a road trip...
4784404 4786810 Take it easy, they say taking<br />off is the hardest part.
4786811 4788046 Really, I'd heard...
4788341 4792332 - I'll be honest, I missed some classes.<br />- Ha Ha, you did? Really?
4792333 4795813 You got your license, right?<br />To fly one of these things...
4797790 4801333 Hey hey.<br />There we go, we're up!
4807420 4809930 That's good, that's<br />pretty good.
4811437 4815225 Jesus! Look at that! This<br />whole area's blacked out.
4816588 4819160 How will we find Warlocks house?
4820449 4824298 It will probably be the only one<br />with the lights still on.
4829968 4834836 Power outage keeps spreading,<br />half the east coast has gone down.
4836042 4838475 Alright, put everything<br />on emergency generators.
4838476 4841347 How the hell are they<br />getting past us?
4846085 4847928 - OK, down there, I see it.<br />- Down there?
4847929 4849370 Left, left, down.
4854092 4855898 We gonna land there?
4857643 4859989 - Alright, hang on.<br />- Oh, Jesus!
4863437 4864796 The fence! The fence!
4867042 4869222 - The fence! The fence!<br />- I see it...
4869223 4870634 Watch...
4882874 4885346 - Oh, Jesus!<br />- Come on.
4885347 4889396 - Oh yeah, taking off is the hardest part.<br />- Let's go!
4892221 4896355 There's something you need to know<br />about Warlock, he hates cops...
4896356 4900020 He hates them, so let<br />me do all the talking.
4911822 4915914 Hey Mrs. Kludis.<br />Is Freddy home?
4917847 4922414 I am Matt Farrell and that is Billy.
4924165 4925981 We are friends from Space Camp.
4925982 4929382 We went to Space Camp with Freddy.
4929383 4930754 Freddy!
4931408 4934227 - Freddy?<br />- You got company.
4940444 4943263 Frederick, didn't you hear me?
4943431 4946807 - All Baltimore heard you, ma.<br />- Your friends are here.
4946808 4948954 Friends? But what the...
4949455 4953729 Ma, how many times, you don't<br />bring people down here?
4953730 4958712 I can't see too well, you have<br />lost so much weight!
4958713 4960816 No, dude I gained 30 lbs,<br />who is that?
4960817 4963704 You know what it doesn't matter?<br />What are you even doing here?
4963705 4967189 I am rocking 5 generators just<br />so I can stay online.
4967190 4971013 And since you are being hunted by<br />assassins, maybe this visit
4971014 4973560 isn't a productive or a healthy way<br />of spending my time.
4973561 4977635 - Hey, don't touch that alright?<br />- CB radio?
4978356 4981681 - A little low tech for you isn't it?<br />- Old? That my friend...
4981682 4984103 Is an end of the world<br />insurance system, OK.
4984104 4986003 When the last microchip is down<br />I will be able to...
4986004 4989203 Be in contact with the world,<br />be they zombies or not.
4989204 4990232 I'll tell you that right now.
4990233 4993898 - What did you bring your Dad here for?<br />- He is cool, he's into games.
4993899 4999049 - Nice poster.<br />- Oh, what are you, a fan of Fett?
4999050 5005330 - No, I was more of a Star Wars guy.<br />- Star Wars! Who is this man?
5005331 5006361 He is...
5006363 5010400 Dump-truck, I'm not his Dad,<br />I am a cop. How about that?
5010401 5013253 Ah, a cop, I'm sorry.<br />Thank you very much.
5013254 5015725 Why'd you bring a cop into<br />my Command Centre?
5015726 5019715 - Command Centre?! It is a basement.<br />- It is a Command Centre!
5019716 5021440 Don't help, McClane!<br />I can explain...
5021441 5025015 Tell us what you know about Thomas<br />Gabriel. That's why we came here.
5025016 5027710 Thomas Gabriel, that's cool,<br />I didn't know. I'm sorry.
5027711 5030697 Get out, I want you out of here,<br />man, right now!
5030698 5031802 Hey, calm down.
5031817 5035069 - Just calm down big boy.<br />- You calm down, it's my house!
5035833 5042245 You are going to tell me what I wanna know.<br />Or I'm gonna kill you in your own house.
5054885 5057398 4 years ago the D.O.D.<br />Recruits Thomas Gabriel...
5057399 5059007 To be a cyber spook for them, OK.
5059008 5061368 First day on the job he<br />goes and tells his bosses...
5061369 5065273 That the nations security infrastructure<br />is wide open to compromise.
5065274 5067946 And what did they say?<br />"We will take it under advisement."
5067947 5070856 But he doesn't ease up 'cos he is<br />committed, like you read about.
5070857 5073697 So he breaks into a meeting<br />of the Joint chiefs of Staff, OK?
5073698 5076993 Using just a laptop he<br />hacks into NORAD
5076994 5078482 and shuts down the<br />entire defence network
5078483 5082072 So they put a gun to his head<br />and forced him to stop the hack,
5082073 5085139 Thomas Gabriel is the guy who<br />shut down NORAD with a laptop,
5085140 5088122 just to prove a point,<br />you think I'm scared of you?
5088123 5091104 - Just tell us how to find the guy.<br />- I don't know how, he is a ghost.
5091105 5092648 He just fell off the grid.
5092860 5095080 - Another dead end, come on.<br />- Hold on wait, McClane,
5095081 5098288 Listen, Warlock, a couple of<br />weeks ago I wrote this...
5098289 5101111 I know dude, you wrote a<br />mutating algorithm security code
5101112 5103628 that's probably being used<br />by Thomas Gabriel right now.
5103629 5105605 No, we know that, yes.
5105606 5108282 - Can you tell us what he's using it for?<br />- I've been trying to figure that out..
5108408 5109033 Here, look...
5111116 5113984 The only security system in<br />the country, that I can find,
5114055 5116141 currently employing<br />that particular template,
5116232 5118440 is the Social Security<br />Administration, ok?
5118441 5121195 They don't even use it<br />in the main facility, look.
5121196 5124458 They use it in this building,<br />over here, in Woodlawn.
5125260 5126749 What the hell...
5126950 5128521 - I know, right?<br />- Right, what?
5128522 5129797 What the hell you guys talking about?
5129798 5131583 The power consumption is off the charts.
5131584 5132475 It's hot, on fire.
5132476 5135070 - The chilling towers?<br />- That's what I thought.
5136969 5141332 - Hello, what's a chilling tower?<br />- Jees, see what I've been dealing with?
5141784 5146008 Large server farms generate a<br />lot of heat, they need to be cooled.
5146009 5146869 Why there?
5146870 5151914 I don't know what is in that building but I<br />assure you it's not Social Security numbers.
5157055 5161942 I have a red flag over here,<br />someone's hacking into Woodlawn.
5163066 5168673 Tracking IP on the server now...<br />Frederick Kaludis.
5169082 5171592 - Let's take a look at him.<br />- Fat bastard!
5177143 5179961 McClane. Where is his daughter?
5180154 5182160 We just got a trace on her cell.
5182161 5183746 You're gonna love this.
5188151 5190787 Alright let's get<br />a better look at you.
5202211 5206953 <i>Freddy, what the hell are you<br />doing, meddling in my network?</i>
5212253 5215589 <i>McClane? I thought<br />I'd killed you already.</i>
5216272 5218105 I get that sometimes.
5221293 5224505 Do you think you can<br />track where he is?
5225310 5230125 <i>Detective, covering the camera with<br />your hand, doesn't turn off the microphone.</i>
5231054 5236736 I know that am not as smart as<br />you guys and this computer shit.
5237363 5241145 But hey, I'm still<br />alive aint I?
5241706 5245796 I mean you got to be running<br />outta bad guys by now, right?
5250212 5251698 Gabriel?
5254167 5256877 Honestly, you can tell me.<br />How's that work?
5256878 5262210 Is it some kind of service or something?<br />Some kind of 1-800 number, 1-800 henchmen?
5262472 5264204 I bet you are still<br />on hold waiting:
5264205 5267958 "Get another dead Asian hooker<br />bitch over here right away?"
5270003 5274210 But seriously, all that kicking<br />aside, that skinny ninja chick...
5274211 5275687 <i>she was smoking hot.</i>
5276480 5279477 Another one of those is gonna be<br />real hard to come by, right?
5279514 5283677 - You're very impressed with yourself, aren't you?<br />- I have my moments.
5283870 5284696 Yeah?
5287043 5289033 Is this one of them?
5293604 5296900 - Hello?<br />- Yes, Emergency Services calling.
5297029 5299017 - Oh, thank God.<br />- Can she hear me?
5299018 5301420 My name is Lucy Gennero, I have been<br />stuck for hours, been trying to call...
5301421 5303334 - My cell phone's not working...<br />- Can she hear this?
5303336 5305656 Lucy, hang up that phone.
5305657 5309314 <i>Calm down miss.<br />We know exactly where you are.</i>
5309675 5312494 - Everything will be alright.<br />- Lucy, hang up the phone!
5313075 5316612 Please, John, I am<br />trying to have a conversation.
5318687 5322678 <i>We are a bit overloaded tonight,<br />as you may imagine,</i>
5322679 5324614 but I assure you, we are<br />gonna get you out of there...
5324615 5327898 Even if I have to come down there<br />and get you myself.
5328139 5329069 Thank you.
5329173 5333185 In the meantime, Miss Gennero, is there<br />anybody we can contact for you?
5333186 5336791 Yes, my Dad.
5337823 5341948 His name is John McClane,<br />He's a New York City cop.
5342120 5347234 <i>We'll find him, just hang in<br />there Miss and we will get to you.</i>
5347235 5348677 <i>Very soon.</i>
5350633 5351868 <i>Thank you.</i>
5352860 5358663 <i>Wow, that's a great girl you<br />got there, can't wait to meet her.</i>
5358887 5361897 <i>What's the matter,<br />cat got your tongue?</i>
5361898 5366183 Come on John? Make a joke.
5367126 5369431 Say something funny.
5376334 5379475 Wait, where are you going?
5379976 5383452 Hey, hold up. Where are you going?<br />What are you gonna do?
5383474 5385376 What do you think I'm gonna do?
5386003 5388565 I'm gonna kill this guy<br />and get my daughter.
5388566 5390137 - But she can be...<br />- No, listen to me.
5390138 5392825 It's gonna get messy,<br />You should just stay here.
5392827 5395858 - I think I...<br />- Hey, I'm doing you a favour.
5395860 5398056 I wouldn't bet on me, alright?
5398057 5402061 I'll take it from here.<br />Thanks for the help.
5409100 5414565 I wouldn't bet on you either,<br />so I guess I'll give you a hand.
5415640 5416675 OK.
5443248 5445761 F.B.I. Ma'am,<br />Jersey Field Office.
5445762 5448270 Mind if I see your ID?
5448271 5449589 None at all.
5458797 5461615 My dad is a cop, force some habit.
5461811 5465116 Your father sounds like<br />a very smart man.
5469674 5473614 - Kid, can you get Bowman?<br />- Uhh, yeah.
5483828 5485720 It's completely dead.
5486018 5490537 Gabriel must have shut down<br />all of the satellite links. Shit!
5494952 5497464 I'm sorry about Lucy, man.
5500243 5501555 All of it...
5502584 5505635 It is my fault you got into this,<br />this wasn't your fight.
5505636 5508087 You have nothing to be sorry about.
5512616 5513852 Bastard!
5513855 5515540 This bitch is a handful.
5521091 5522777 Are you gonna be alright?
5526086 5528300 Behave or I will hurt you.
5528301 5531417 Oh yeah? Let's step outside,<br />just you and me.
5532112 5534151 We will see who hurts who!
5535305 5538949 You really are his daughter.<br />Tie her wrists.
5546172 5548683 Trey! Gabriel wants to see you.
5548684 5551222 - Is it that time already?<br />- Yes.
5555213 5557620 I'll be back in a second.
5562226 5564080 Don't kill me! Please!
5609446 5613059 We are showing a breach<br />in an external vent.
5616681 5618368 Go take a look.
5619488 5622307 Don't be long, we are<br />packing up soon.
5634168 5635460 Hey, McClane!
5635559 5637959 Do we have anything resembling<br />a plan or anything?
5638048 5639669 To find Lucy and kill everybody else.
5640191 5643785 I mean like a plan,<br />like a way to do that.
5645601 5647184 Come on.
5648414 5653756 OK, according to the layout, the chilling<br />towers are kept on the bottom level.
5659159 5660193 It should be locked.
5665175 5667636 OK, now it looks like we are<br />getting somewhere.
5680364 5683530 OK this looks like it controls the<br />cooling system for the mainframe, which...
5683532 5686042 Should be...
5686544 5688706 If I can just hack in...
5689581 5693122 And trip the alarm,<br />it might alert Bowman.
5701503 5703428 Someone set off the alarms.
5703509 5705515 Yes, thank you detective.<br />I can hear that.
5705516 5708023 Find a way to turn it off.
5711742 5713276 What you got?
5714340 5715837 We got a problem.
5716039 5718447 The alarms went off at Woodlawn.
5719563 5721369 It's got to be him.
5721982 5724077 And what's, Woodlawn?
5727589 5729597 It's N.S.A.
5729598 5732193 A secure facility outside of Baltimore.
5732194 5734823 It's a failsafe we built after 9/11...
5734859 5737132 To backup all financial information.
5737133 5739656 The moment the networks were hit<br />all the financial data...
5739657 5742638 It automatically began<br />downloading to those servers.
5742639 5745236 Banks, Wall Street,<br />Corporate Records...
5745237 5747559 Government funds, all of it.
5747657 5751694 Basically a backup for the<br />accumulated wealth of America.
5751696 5753380 All in one location?
5755193 5757868 - What could Gabriel do with it?<br />- If he could get in he might try...
5757869 5761213 A transfer of the data<br />to a portable hard drive,
5761214 5763187 then he can have access to<br />those accounts from anywhere.
5763188 5766071 Syphon of billions for himself.
5766199 5768178 We would have no way to trace it.
5768180 5770659 But knowing him,<br />he could erase it all
5770660 5773736 and send us all back to the stone age.
5773737 5776230 Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
5776231 5777857 Frankly...
5777877 5781861 - It's above your pay grade.<br />- My pay grade?
5783770 5788217 How did Gabriel find out about<br />this when I didn't even know?
5791283 5792864 He designed it.
5794857 5796714 It was his program.
5796925 5802419 He knew that hacking your system<br />last night would trigger the download.
5802421 5803918 That's brilliant!
5804428 5807855 You two, geniuses,<br />stay out of my way.
5812943 5816421 Let me see if I can<br />get a floor plan of this place.
5817472 5818745 Don't move!
5819709 5822487 You!<br />Get away from the bag! Now!
5822488 5823558 OK.
5823767 5825825 We've been waiting for you.
5826978 5828007 Yeah?
5829098 5831446 I've been waiting for you too.
5857578 5858870 McClane!
5861026 5862094 McClane!
5865144 5866173 Kid?
5866743 5867773 Matt? Kid?
5882687 5884494 <i>Emerson...</i>
5885212 5888192 We seem to have a problem<br />in one of the cooling towers.
5888194 5889633 - Tower 7.<br />- Tower 7.
5889634 5892966 - Find out what's going on.<br />- I will see to it. OK.
5901441 5902473 Sir?
5902510 5905138 Get the HR team to stand by.<br />We need to get Woodlawn, now.
5905139 5908285 The roads out, completely blocked.<br />DC's in total gridlock.
5908286 5910296 Then get us some helicopters.
5910297 5912786 They have all been pulled by the<br />Pentagon, for search and rescue.
5912787 5916668 Molina, find me some God damned<br />helicopters immediately.
5917799 5920809 Look, the Pentagon has jets<br />flying cap over DC.
5920814 5923838 Have them send one over to Woodlawn<br />and keep on eye on things until we get there.
5923839 5925303 Let's go!
5936868 5938672 Where is my daughter?
5938874 5940353 <i>Russo, check in.</i>
5944894 5949227 <i>I think Russo is on his way down<br />to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.</i>
5949854 5952861 <i>He's on the third floor, the kid...</i>
5959426 5961537 <i>Did you get all that?</i>
5961539 5963309 <i>That's right.</i>
5963345 5967071 I am on the third floor,<br />but I'm coming to get ya.
5975407 5978231 Don't move, pal,<br />I will send a doctor.
5980951 5984645 Kill this guy and<br />I will give you Mai's cut.
5984992 5986288 <i>OK.</i>
6030202 6032569 My algorithm.
6037619 6039095 Please... God.
6040730 6042965 Please... God.
6078853 6082026 Oh Jesus, they are<br />going after the money.
6105657 6108228 <i>You coming to get me, John?<br />Is that the plan?</i>
6108229 6110527 Yep, that's my plan.
6110528 6113889 What makes you think I wont put a<br />bullet in your daughter's head, right now?
6113891 6115330 Because you are scared of me.
6115331 6118007 Is that right, you think<br />I am afraid of you?
6118008 6120065 Cos otherwise she would<br />be dead already.
6120066 6122290 <i>You need a bargaining chip.</i>
6128105 6130734 Stop there! Hands up!
6130771 6133530 If you kill me, you'll never get it open.
6136101 6138020 Move away. Move!
6145149 6149240 You know John, I feel like<br />we have gotten off on the wrong foot.
6149915 6153392 <i>And 'cos of that you think<br />I'm the bad guy,</i>
6153415 6156553 Nothing could be further from the<br />truth, I'm the good guy here.
6156554 6160207 I told them this could happen<br />if they didn't prepare.
6160208 6162523 Did I get a thank you?<br />No, I got crucified.
6162524 6165354 - But they wouldn't listen.<br />- You got their attention now, don't you?
6165355 6167253 That's right.
6167929 6170907 I am doing the country a favour.
6170914 6172645 <i>Ha ha, by tearing it apart?</i>
6172646 6175168 Better me than some outsider,
6175481 6177995 some religious nut job<br />bent on Armageddon.
6177996 6179762 <i>Nobody wants to see that happen.</i>
6179763 6182991 Everything I've broken, can be fixed.
6183707 6187044 If the country is willing to pay for it.
6187045 6190059 Ah bullshit!<br />It's always been about the money.
6190060 6192549 What, I shouldn't get<br />paid for my work?
6192550 6194671 I'm workin' my ass<br />off here, John.
6194672 6198160 Just sit tight asshole,<br />I got a cheque for ya.
6201004 6202398 I can't talk to this guy.
6202399 6206424 You talk to him, see if<br />you can get him to focus.
6206425 6207705 Dad?
6209752 6211034 <i>Hi, baby.</i>
6212463 6214258 Now there only 5 of them.
6217004 6219519 Hang on, Lucy, I'm coming.
6230190 6233309 Would somebody, please,<br />kill this son of a bitch.
6235117 6236435 We have a problem.
6237933 6241954 There actually no problem here<br />I just got off at the wrong floor.
6244168 6245862 This is a mess.
6248136 6250044 Wow, I'm truly impressed, man.
6251609 6253920 Hacking all the financial data<br />of the whole country would take weeks,
6253921 6256767 unless you eliminated the congestion.
6256768 6260279 That's what this Fire Sale<br />is about, isn't it?
6260280 6262576 - It's brilliant.<br />- Yes, it is.
6262577 6265182 - Please, be quiet.<br />- Asshole.
6265183 6268318 - Who are you?<br />- Matt Farrell.
6269203 6270633 Lucy McClane.
6271347 6273748 I thought your name was Gennero.
6273855 6275380 Lucy Gennero?
6275434 6278627 - Not today.<br />- Can you crack the code?
6278886 6281297 Maybe, if I had enough time.
6281557 6282936 That is encouraging.
6284925 6286181 We take them with us.
6287117 6289731 - Let's go.<br />- Let's go.
6291471 6294467 Gabriel, the Pentagon just sent<br />an F-35 towards us.
6294468 6295959 Keep an eye on it.
6298583 6301600 Pulling the go codes now.
6316425 6321171 Might wanna start thinking what<br />you want on your headstone, asshole.
6328250 6330171 Damned, hamster.
6330528 6331613 There you go!
6331944 6334895 Be still, spider boy.
6338520 6339800 That's right!
6384036 6388679 Seriously, you probably shouldn't<br />antagonise them since they have all the guns.
6388680 6391475 Listen, will you just take a minute and<br />dig deep for a bigger set of balls...
6391476 6393317 Because you are going to need them<br />before we are through.
6393318 6394779 Wow, I know that tone.
6394784 6398115 It's just weird hearing it<br />from someone with hair.
6434630 6438201 Sir, E.T.A. 15 minutes.
6492381 6493871 Fix it.
6493919 6497684 Why? You are just going to kill me<br />if I fix it, I know that.
6504988 6506477 Shit!
6509585 6511174 I'm not gonna do it.
6516059 6519855 - No no no! Shit.<br />- Robertson is coming really fast.
6520082 6521895 - I'm sorry, what?<br />- Something is wrong.
6521896 6524366 Robertson is coming too fast.
6528135 6529504 It's not Robertson.
6530127 6532126 That would be my Dad.
6543551 6544635 <i>Freddy!</i>
6546639 6547817 <i>Freddy!</i>
6549763 6552293 <i>This is John McClane.<br />Look, I know you can hear me.</i>
6552294 6553992 This is your frequency, right?
6553993 6556820 666. Come on pick<br />up the mic, Freddy.
6560054 6562750 Nobody here by that name, sorry.
6562751 6564847 Hacker jerk off!
6569357 6570862 Warlock!
6571371 6574390 I need you to do whatever<br />it is that you do...
6574391 6576481 To patch me through<br />to the F.B.I.
6576482 6579743 To Deputy Director Bowman,<br />you hear me?
6580018 6583529 Are you serious, you want me<br />to intentionally open up a com-line...
6583530 6588066 <i>to the head of the C.I.A.<br />Cyber division? I don't think so.</i>
6588067 6591496 Freddy, God damn it!<br />They have my daughter!
6595519 6597415 <i>I can do that, hold on.</i>
6599133 6600206 Thank you.
6607185 6611208 <i>This is central, we have a<br />patch for Director Bowman.</i>
6611209 6614550 Sir, central is trying to reach you.
6615646 6616943 Go.
6617043 6619259 - Bowman, it's McClane.<br />- McClane.
6619261 6621843 Listen to me,<br />Gabriel is on the 695,
6621844 6623512 headed north, in a<br />haz-mat truck.
6623513 6626615 <i>Wait, Gabriel has left Woodlawn?<br />We were heading there right now.</i>
6626616 6629766 Bowman, he's got my daughter.
6630988 6635876 Listen, this haz-mat truck, it's a<br />government vehicle so it should be Lo-Jacked, right?
6635877 6638380 Track that down,<br />should take you right to him.
6638381 6640393 - Gimmie the tag number?<br />- Alright,
6640394 6642042 Here it comes.
6642077 6644926 Golf, Tango...
6645427 6648973 Five-Niner-Two, November.
6649453 6652471 I've got it.<br />McClane, where is Farrell?
6652472 6653960 He is with them.
6655492 6658829 Listen to me, I'm gonna<br />go in there and get Lucy out.
6659515 6661530 But if something happens to me...
6661531 6663644 <i>you gotta send in the cavalry,<br />do you hear me?</i>
6663645 6667983 I mean everybody, don't let that<br />maniac get my daughter, you hear me?
6667984 6669580 John, don't worry.
6669581 6671891 I want your word, Bowman.
6673609 6675092 Yeah, you have it.
6676312 6677939 Why not?
6684881 6686678 There's the F-35.
6689194 6691194 Did you get the go codes?
6691195 6694255 - Trey! Did you get the go codes?<br />- Yes, I got the go codes.
6694256 6696536 Can you connect me to the pilot?
6713165 6715372 Isolating his radio.
6720394 6723218 Sending him the go codes.
6729965 6731202 AV-81.

6773734 6775833 You're shooting the wrong guy!
6783305 6785879 I don't think Daddy's<br />coming, honey.
6797593 6801204 Hey! Jackass!
6848164 6849751 Is that it?
6853279 6855244 Is that your best shot?
7021309 7024135 Come on, get out. That way.
7034141 7037173 We are leaving in 3 minutes.
7039894 7042362 You have 1.
7042398 7047196 The rules didn't change man, you're<br />gonna kill me the minute I unlock it.
7050449 7052462 - Ah, shit!<br />- Matthew?
7052463 7056200 Matthew! I really need<br />you to pay attention.
7056900 7059507 The rules can always change.
7059508 7062331 - OK OK.<br />- I will shoot in her in 10 seconds.
7062332 7065352 - Wait, wait.<br />- Nine.
7065524 7067848 - I can't...<br />- Eight.
7068563 7070258 I can't...
7071332 7072703 Oh, God!
7075608 7078126 OK!
7078630 7080441 Ok, ok, ok!
7080641 7082128 Six.
7082293 7085164 OK, stop stop, I'm doing it.
7085165 7087036 I'm doing it. Oh, God!
7102291 7104719 The Feds are heading this way.
7104817 7107127 Get everything on the plane.
7115375 7117186 - Dad?<br />- Careful.
7117901 7122407 Don't worry baby,<br />Everything is going to be alright.
7123981 7125521 Daddy!
7133022 7134507 Hold this.
7160560 7162268 Jesus Christ!
7162727 7164651 You got her?
7165201 7166688 You sure?
7169228 7171240 Nice effort though.
7171241 7172743 Matthew?
7173254 7175264 Shit. OK.
7175265 7177063 I'm doing it, I know.
7184325 7185828 McClane...
7186749 7188663 Would you do me a favour?
7190876 7193382 I know the lights are<br />beginning to dim...
7193383 7195886 But if you can just hang<br />on for a second...
7195887 7199418 As soon as Matts finishes,<br />I'm gonna kill him and your daughter
7199419 7202554 And I would love for you<br />to see that.
7203778 7205677 God damn it. Mathew?
7205871 7208992 10 second, ok, 10 seconds<br />and you will have all your money.
7208993 7210909 You can just leave,<br />nobody has to get hurt, OK?
7210910 7214014 A few seconds.<br />Stay with me, McClane...
7215523 7218758 - Stay with me.<br />- Dad?
7219190 7221538 On your tombstone<br />it shall read:
7221539 7224776 "Always in the wrong place,<br />at the wrong time"
7225583 7229674 How about:<br />"Yippi-kai-ay, mother fu..."
7242878 7244159 Daddy?
7245967 7248586 - Are you OK?<br />- Yeah, I'm fine...
7250740 7253265 I knew you would come for me.
7253266 7257140 Of course I would come for you.<br />It's OK.
7271880 7273177 Freeze!
7273895 7276720 Hold up, Hold up!<br />He's OK.
7281984 7284295 Help Daddy up.
7285575 7287612 I think I'll just stay<br />here for a minute.
7288880 7290985 Daddy, you are out of your mind.
7291489 7293798 - What are you talking about?<br />- You shot yourself.
7293799 7296325 It seemed like a good idea at the time.
7297138 7300793 Don't tell these guys<br />that I did that, OK?
7316465 7318096 Is he OK?
7319567 7323770 Lift your arms up,<br />Now put them down, further.
7324698 7327704 He might die from shock<br />on the way to the hospital.
7331744 7333232 Alright.
7335770 7337256 I'll be right back.
7339792 7342812 - Hey.<br />- How does it feel to be shot?
7342813 7345280 Actually it feels great. He gave me...
7345281 7347689 What's it called? Morfon...? Morphine.
7348304 7353393 - Well, you got your merit badge now?<br />- Yeah... I don't know what that means.
7353394 7356732 - Plus, you know, chicks dig scars.<br />- Really?
7358917 7361936 - Not that one.<br />- What?
7361937 7364978 - Don't even think about it.<br />- How did you know what I was thinking?
7364979 7368979 What, did she say something to you?<br />I felt, we had a vibe...
7368980 7371805 Take it easy, it's just<br />the morphine kicking in.
7372904 7376242 Besides, after all we've been through,
7376300 7379585 I'd hate to have to<br />beat you to death.
7379776 7381503 That would suck.
7383562 7385655 - Good to go?<br />- Yeah, all set.
7385656 7388892 Take care of yourself<br />I'll see you in the hospital.
7395764 7398884 Hey. Thanks for saving<br />my daughter's life.
7400179 7403004 What was I gonna do?
7404181 7406699 That's what makes you "that" guy.
7409237 7410725 Yeah.
7418293 7420502 Did he say anything about me?
7422114 7423927 Jesus, Lucy!
7423962 7427158 What? I'm sorry,<br />I'm just asking.
7428188 7431564 I'm in enough pain already.<br />Hospital...
