1720620 1721770 Happy, happy holiday.
1721860 1724130 The worst part, Mr Trudeau,<br />was the press.
1724220 1726650 They were here for the Esperanza story,...
1726740 1730370 ..so they got it right on the fucking news,<br />bloodstains and all.
1730460 1733340 l'd like to lock every damn reporter<br />out ofthe airport,...
1733420 1736140 ..but they'd pull<br />that freedom-of-speech crap on us.
1736220 1738020 Then the ACLU would be all over us.
1738100 1742010 Murder on television.<br />Hell of a start for Christmas week.
1742100 1745570 What is it?<br />A gang thing like last time?
1745660 1748410 Only ifyour gangs get<br />their training at Fort Bragg.
1749900 1751410 - Who the hell is this?<br />- Uh-uh, McClane.
1751500 1754330 - l'm a police officer...<br />- ln an unauthorised area.
1754420 1756220 LA, Mr Trudeau, don't mean shit.
1756300 1758890 That's what l said about<br />my last cholesterol test.
1758980 1762530 So what's your problem,<br />Lieutenant McClane?
1763980 1765930 l'm sure Captain Lorenzo explained...
1766020 1768210 ..the minor fracas with the minor thieves.
1768300 1770450 Maybe he can explain this.
1788700 1790130 All systems tapped, Colonel.
1790220 1791410 Fire it up.
1806020 1809410 H minus five minutes. Stand by.
1810460 1814290 OK, we've got a body in the morgue<br />that seems to have died twice.
1814380 1816940 Assuming it's not a computer error,<br />what do we assume?
1817020 1819250 That somebody's about<br />to fuck with this airport.
1819340 1821220 What the hell is that supposed to mean?
1821300 1825050 l know we're dummies up here,<br />so give us a taste ofyour genius.

1834620 1836340 Not luggage thieves and not punks.
1836420 1839140 - Professional at what?<br />- What the fuck do you think this is?
1839220 1840290 The safety patrol?
1840380 1842290 This is the résumé<br />of a professional mercenary.
1842380 1844330 The world's biggest drug dealer<br />is due here.
1844420 1846010 You need a slide rule to solve this,...
1846100 1848980 ..or another body in a bag<br />before you ask questions?
1849060 1852290 You're the one that gave us<br />that fucking body. Remember that.
1852380 1853780 Yeah, l remember that.
1860620 1864580 Lorenzo, have all your shift<br />commanders report in. Now.

2061420 2063770 ..of this flight, the importance ofits cargo.
2063860 2066900 This plane will not be met by anyone.
2066980 2069890 lt will land on a runway<br />of my designation,...
2069980 2073330 ..where it will remain<br />isolated and unapproached.
2073420 2075810 That will conclude<br />my interest in this aircraft...
2075900 2077540 ..and your responsibility for it.
2077620 2081500 At the same time,<br />l want a 747 cargo conversion,...

2116020 2117690 lf Esperanza gets to a country...
2117780 2120250 ..with no extradition treaties,<br />we're fucked.
2120340 2123410 They're talking to us on our own system.<br />They got to be close.
2123500 2125380 My men will tear this airport apart.
2125460 2127100 Just in the nick oftime, huh?
2127180 2129650 l got a first-class unit here,<br />SWAT team and all.
2129740 2132300 We don't need<br />any Monday-morning quarterbacks.

2142860 2144890 Mr Trudeau, there are FAA regulations...
2144980 2147940 ..regarding unauthorised personnel<br />in the control tower!
2148020 2149970 We just have to find a way to transmit.

2160420 2164010 - See Mr McClane out.<br />- You got no business being up here.
2164100 2166690 Everything we need<br />is by the annexe skywalk...
2166780 2169290 ..just sitting there, waiting to go on line.

2272260 2274900 Whatever we can think of,<br />they can think of, too.

2282780 2285050 Another basement. Another elevator.
2285140 2288370 How can the same shit happen<br />to the same guy twice?

2362260 2364210 This is Dulles approach to all aircraft...
2364300 2366210 ..holding atPotomac vortex.
2366300 2368860 We are experiencing<br />some technicalproblems.
2368940 2371010 Weather conditions,<br />which have deteriorated...
2371100 2375410 ..have nowbeen complicated<br />by an unforeseen human factor.
2375500 2379050 This has affectedall<br />of our electronic equipment...
2379140 2381130 ..and theirredundantbackups.
2381220 2384770 As a result, ournav<br />and approach systems are down.
2384860 2387090 We expect to lose<br />voice in anotherminute.
2387180 2388530 We wantyou to continue...
2388620 2391420 ..holding at the outermarker<br />as directed...

2446820 2448970 Well, let me see here, now.
2449060 2450780 Well, this must be it right there.
2450860 2455410 See? That's the raised platform<br />and there's the new terminal.
2455500 2456900 There's your skywalk.
2457460 2460210 Goddamn bottleneck.<br />Nice place for an ambush.
2461700 2464660 What's the fastest way<br />you can get me out to that spot?
2467140 2470340 This kind ofthing wasn't<br />in myjob description.
2470420 2474380 - Mr Barnes, we'll watch your back.<br />- Yeah? Who watches yours?
2485260 2487060 Main ventilation duct.
2487900 2489380 Ventilation duct...
2490300 2491700 ..and bingo.

2515140 2517290 We're in the annexe skywalk.<br />l can see the array.
2517380 2520260 l'll give you a call<br />for a protocol test when it's hot.
2520340 2521490 That's all for now.
2521580 2523970 (Barnes)<br />Sergeant, we need more equipment.
2524060 2525860 l'd like to send one<br />of your guys for it.
2525940 2527690 Right, sir. You got it.
2529660 2530730 What the hell?
2530820 2532490 What the hell's going on?

2719740 2721090 Agh! Ugh!
2729100 2732010 l'm going to kick your fucking ass.
2763820 2766780 - Jeez.<br />- You all right?
2766860 2770650 Yeah. But the antenna array,...<br />l got to get to it and set it up.
2775340 2776490 Get down!
2795100 2797130 (Goddamn.)
2798660 2799890 Bait.
2802380 2803860 Jerk us off.
2803940 2807410 Make Lorenzo sacrifice his best men.
2811140 2813610 Make you waste your time,...
2816420 2818220 ..time we don't have.
2831740 2834130 l think you're closer than 50 yards.
2834220 2837610 So's that airplane. Practically.
2837700 2839810 Yeah. There's quite a few ofthem.
2839900 2841850 lt looks like a regular traffic jam.
2841940 2843820 There's nothing regular about it.
2844380 2846260 See? You're intrigued.
2846340 2848930 That's my gift, Mrs McClane.<br />l notice things.
2849020 2853570 Things other people wouldn't see.<br />That's how l make people curious.
2853660 2855410 Don't you mean nauseous?
2855500 2859650 Look. The people have a right<br />to know everything about everybody.
2859740 2861730 You got in the way ofthat.
2861820 2864540 Listen, buster.<br />You endangered my children.
2864620 2867450 You didn't do it<br />for anything as noble as the people.
2867540 2869180 The only time you see the people,...
2869260 2871770 ..is when you look down to see<br />what you're stepping on.
2876420 2878410 Me? Yeah, l'll live.
2878500 2880570 But Lorenzo's SWAT team is dead,...
2880660 2883050 ..and the antenna array is gone.
2883140 2885210 - (beeping)<br />- Didn't you see it?!
2886660 2889010 lt's hard looking for a new miracle.
2890460 2893290 (Barnes) Hold for a minute.<br />l'll be right back.
2893380 2895370 Hold for a second.<br />Something's going on.
2895460 2898260 Yeah. Just hold on for a minute.
2898340 2901140 l say again, annexe team,<br />give us a sitrep.
2902340 2905300 Annexe team, come in. Do you copy?
2906540 2908210 lt's got a scrambler on it.
2908300 2910490 Can you do anything with it?
2911660 2915450 No. This scramble mode<br />must activate on this code panel.
2915540 2918500 Even ifwe scan their frequency,<br />we can't listen in.
2918580 2920530 - These guys are pros.<br />- So are you. Break the code.
2920620 2922610 l want to hear<br />what these bastards are saying.
2922700 2925260 This is a ten-digit control panel.<br />Six-digit read-out.
2925340 2927850 Hell, there could be<br />a million combinations.
2927940 2931730 Next time you kill one ofthese guys,<br />get him to enter the code first.
2931820 2932930 Yeah.
2934100 2937330 Sir, we just monitored a call<br />from their Chief Engineer.
2937420 2939890 We took out their SWAT team,<br />completely.
2939980 2942620 You were right.<br />They went for the antenna array.
2942700 2946250 - We're on schedule.<br />- Losing our team wasn't part ofthe plan.
2951300 2952890 Attention, Dulles tower.
2952980 2954620 Attention, Dulles control tower.
2954700 2957660 Mr Trudeau, lknowyou're listening.
2957740 2961330 - Unfortunately, you're not obeying.<br />- Try me face to face.
2961420 2963250 You were warned<br />not to restore your systems.
2963340 2966970 You've wastedlives andprecious time<br />on a futile and obvious target.
2967060 2969700 Now you're going to pay the penalty.
2969780 2971890 l've got five dead officers, Colonel Stuart.
2971980 2973650 lsn't thatpenalty enough?
2973740 2976410 McClane, keep out ofthis.<br />You've been a pain...
2978220 2979860 (Stuart) Oh, McClane.

2991220 2992620 Hey, Colonel, blow me.
2992700 2996370 How much drug money is Esperanza<br />paying you to turn traitor?
2996460 3000170 Cardinal Richelieu said it best:<br />''Treason is merely a matter of dates''.
3000260 3004140 This country's got to learn<br />it can'tkeep cutting the legs off...
3004220 3006410 ..of men like General Esperanza.
3006500 3009810 Men who have the guts to stand up<br />against communist aggression.
3009900 3012890 And lesson one starts<br />with killing policemen?
3012980 3015450 What's lesson two, the neutron bomb?
3016460 3019340 No. l think we can find<br />something in between.
3021780 3023100 Watch this.

3417700 3418690 Barnes!
3419780 3423610 We've got to warn those planes<br />there's a lunatic pretending he's the tower.
3423700 3425970 - Get me on the air.<br />- How?
3426060 3427330 You figure it out!
3427420 3428850 Here's the manifest.
3448780 3451770 McClane, l know how you must feel.
3455620 3458580 l wanted to help those people.
3458660 3461410 l was pretty goddamn useless.
3466100 3468410 We called the government for help.
3468500 3472210 They're going to send in<br />a Special army unit.
3472300 3474290 A counterterrorist team.
3480860 3483530 Your wife's plane...
3483620 3487900 They're still broadcasting,<br />even though we can't answer.
3488900 3491890 They're going to run<br />out offuel in 90 minutes.
3503500 3506170 Listen, Dick. That is your name(?)
3506260 3507820 Dick.
3507900 3510620 lf you're going<br />to continue to get this close,...
3510700 3512580 ..could you switch aftershaves?
3513940 3515740 Anything else?
3515820 3518730 Stronger mouthwash might be nice.
3518820 3522130 (TV) Andhere's Sam Coleman<br />reporting live from the accident.
3522220 3525210 Colonel, they've done<br />everything we've anticipated...
3525300 3527020 ..so far.
3527100 3528660 (TV)<br />But still there has been no official word.
3528740 3533050 Despite the fact that only one runway<br />has been closed due to the tragedy,...
3533140 3537340 ..several dozen airliners are visible,<br />endlessly circling the field.
3537420 3541490 Other reports say there was trouble<br />in the towerbefore the crash...
3541580 3544220 ..and that thatmayhave contributed to it.
3544300 3546450 With weather conditions worsening,...
3546540 3548930 ..the problem here<br />and in the sky willgrow.
3549020 3552290 l'm Samantha Coleman<br />at Dulles lnternationalAirport.

3562580 3565330 Did you pack the radio mikes<br />from the shoot or are they here?
3565420 3567330 l wouldn't let those assholes<br />check them in!
3567420 3568570 l love you.
3568660 3570690 Give me one ofthe receivers.
3575020 3578290 Can you tune into<br />the cockpit frequency?
3578380 3581290 - Yeah. Why?<br />- l want to hear what's going on.
3582980 3585330 Should be right here on our band.
3586300 3587290 Nothing.
3587380 3589290 You said it would work.<br />ls it working or not ?
3589380 3593450 lt is working, but all l'm getting<br />is some kind of airport beacon.
3593540 3596420 lt's weird. lt's like the tower isn't there.
3599260 3601010 Stay on it.
3601100 3603770 Let me know when<br />there is something there.

3659900 3661410 Yeah.
3661500 3664810 Now show some good sense.<br />Let the pros handle this.
3664900 3667370 l think the pros<br />are on the wrong team tonight.
3667460 3669260 lsn't Colonel Stuart one ofyour men?
3669340 3670740 No, not anymore, he's not.
3670820 3672930 We're here to take Colonel Stuart down.
3673020 3675170 And we will take him down.
3675260 3678330 l served with him.<br />l taught him everything he knows.
3678420 3682090 Well, maybe he's learned<br />a few more things since then.
3683140 3684460 Let's hustle!
3684540 3687660 The command post will be set up<br />in the airport police station.
3687740 3690650 l want to be tied into the tower<br />in 15 minutes.
3690740 3692380 All right, let's do it!
3694180 3695530 Hey, Trudeau.
3697100 3699330 Did things just get better or worse?
3703460 3705370 Lights. Big, portable lights.
3705460 3707410 We set up the field, and then we...
3707500 3709530 Wait for those lunatics<br />to shoot them out?
3709620 3711020 Where do we get those lights?
3711100 3712530 What about the air phone idea?
3712620 3716250 There's 18 planes up there.<br />Only five ofthem have those phones.
3716340 3718610 We got through to three.<br />We're trying the others.
3718700 3720290 That's 13 potential accidents.
3720380 3722290 Are they still bucking headwinds?
3722380 3724370 Headwinds are slamming<br />everybody over the outer marker.
3724460 3725810 The planes with enough fuel...
3725900 3728570 ..have been shunted<br />to Atlanta, Memphis and Nashville.
3728660 3730690 Outer marker.
3730780 3731690 Damn!
3732580 3734530 The outer marker!
3734620 3737420 lt's a beacon, right?<br />lt sends out this beep beep beep...
3737500 3739090 ..so they know they're over it.
3739180 3742410 - So?<br />- Who says that signal has to beep?
3742500 3745380 We switch the frequency from<br />the tower to the one in the beacon.
3745460 3746940 We pump up the wattage.
3747020 3750010 We can talk to our planes, and<br />those bastards who did this won't know!
3753460 3756100 Traced the signal.<br />Found it in the luggage area.
3756180 3759170 They've been tapped into<br />your tower chatter all night.

3774460 3776340 The regular guy got appendicitis.
3776420 3779140 Word is, nobody's better<br />at this than Major Grant.

4659800 4662190 Esperanza's down,...
4663160 4664270 ..but he's hurt.
4664360 4666350 He took a round in his shoulder.
4666440 4669750 l got one more oftheir guys.<br />That's six they lost altogether.
4669840 4672670 lf we knew how many they had<br />to start with, we could get excited,...
4672760 4676310 ..but ifthey got 50 guys,<br />it's a little early to open the champagne!
4676400 4679990 We appreciate your effort, but we<br />don't need a loose cannon here!
4680080 4683510 What ifthey crash another plane<br />in retaliation for your stunt?
4683600 4685270 They can't do that now, right, Barnes?
4685800 4688470 Besides, if l grabbed Esperanza,<br />this would be over now.
4688560 4691120 Maybe they're more creative<br />than you think!
4691200 4693350 Well, at least l'm thinking, goddammit!
4693440 4697030 We're here to jerk offthat cocksucker<br />until he tries to take off.
4697120 4698110 Period!

4712600 4715110 You men come with me.
4717120 4718600 - McClane.<br />- Yeah, Barnes.
4718680 4721110 You said those guys<br />showed up right away?
4721200 4724110 - Yeah.<br />- That means they're on the field or close.
4724200 4726710 And l think l know where.
4726800 4728510 Let me show you something.
4730840 4733430 These are the old plans<br />with the longer runways.
4733520 4734630 That's 12 years ago.
4734720 4737280 Looks like they've modified the site,...
4737360 4740630 ..moved Tra-Con phones, lLS,<br />all the underground stuff...
4740720 4742510 ..so they could handle drainage.
4742600 4743790 lf l'm right,...
4743880 4746390 ..it would run along the airport property...
4746480 4748590 ..and go right past this neighbourhood.
4751960 4754070 We should have landed two hours ago!
4754160 4756590 l understand, but ifyou just relax...
4756680 4757710 lt's hopeless.
4758960 4762430 Somebody ought to get their ass<br />kicked for this mess.
4762520 4766510 Unfortunately, there isn't anyone<br />we can blame for the weather.
4766600 4769430 Oh, yeah?<br />What about that porker, Willard Scott?
4769520 4771310 l should have taken the bus.
4771400 4774230 At least they can pull over<br />for food and gas.
4774320 4775230 Excuse me.
4775960 4777070 Yes?
4777160 4778710 l was just wondering.
4778800 4783190 This flight originally was<br />supposed to be 5½ hours, right?
4783280 4784070 Mm-hmm.
4784160 4786720 Do we have enough fuel<br />to keep circling like this?
4786800 4787790 Oh, of course.
4787880 4790830 They anticipate little problems like this.

5669120 5673160 The terrorists promise more bloodshed<br />unless their demands are met.
5673240 5677280 Now that the Special army commandos<br />have arrived at the airport,...
5677360 5681110 ..the likelihood of a full-scale battle<br />is dangerously close.
