79054 80140 Yes, thank you.
80535 82389 <i>Hey, are you sure this is legal?</i>
82590 84741 <i>We are just running a test<br />on our security systems, Sir.</i>
84742 85536 <i>It's fine.</i>
86210 87357 You have a sexy voice.

89754 90534 To you?
90624 91728 We have a winner.
102530 103399 Ready.
113146 113905 Yo,
114217 116042 guess who just made 50 G's today.
123022 124446 What'd you do to my drive, man?
124532 126500 Shut up. I didn't touch it.<br />This isn't cool.
126502 128476 Don't ever, ever touch my computer.
197195 198593 Diagnostics show no damage,
198594 200242 but we're certain<br />this was an intentional breach.
200244 201582 You're saying we were hacked?
201723 203381 It wasn't denial of service level,
203537 205107 but they definitely cracked our door.
206829 208852 Ok, open the black hat files.
208899 210763 I want every hacker in the country
210765 212776 who could've done this interviewed now.
212854 214589 Sir, that's close to a thousand names.
214591 216677 With the holiday weekend,<br />we're short-staffed as it is.
216711 217465 Listen,
218189 219919 we're the ones that are supposed<br />to keep this from happening,
219951 221643 and it just happened to us.<br />Get it done.
221952 224852 Sir, it's the middle of the night,<br />they're scattered all over the country.
224998 226818 Fine get local law enforcement to help.
226904 228645 Somebody out there thinks<br />they can screw with us.
228647 230087 I want to find out, who?
235977 237009 Hey, Jimmy!
237494 238567 Wait up, man!
256112 257863 Jim! I said no.
257924 259948 Lucy, you're killing me, alright?
261549 262768 Get out.<br />What?
262774 264563 Get out of the fucking car now!<br />Don't touch me!
264565 266493 No means no, jerk off.<br />What are you doing?
266792 268985 John, stop it!<br />Oh, don't call me that.
269102 270091 I hate it when you call me that.
270093 271769 No, no, no. You know this guy?<br />Shut up.
271792 274091 Just shut your mouth right now.<br />Dad!
274350 275558 Stop it! I mean it!
275995 277464 Dad? You said your dad was dead.
277642 278469 What?
279737 281359 You told this jerk-off I was dead?
281677 282858 You actually said that?
282883 284826 I may have exaggerated a little bit.
287091 289374 And this guy's what,<br />your, your, your boyfriend?
289460 290236 No.<br />Yeah.
292152 293906 I don't know, ok?<br />I'm sorry. Just...
293908 294765 we'll see.
296201 297182 What are you doing here?
298258 300308 You don't answer your phone.<br />You don't return my calls.
300310 301969 That's because I'm not talking to you.
302383 304317 And why aren't you talking<br />to me this time, Lucy?
304327 305205 Why not?
305507 306587 What, you want a list?
306872 309215 How about stuff like this, you spy on me.
309229 310613 You come down here.<br />I'm not spying.
310683 312476 You drag my boyfriend out of the car.<br />I'm not spying.
312478 314026 Thought he wasn't your boyfriend.<br />He's not my boyfriend!
314028 315326 Thought you said I just was.
315328 316414 I... I just...<br />Shut up.
318769 320750 You are such an asshole.
322589 323452 Ok.
323881 327162 I'm sorry I pulled your<br />not-boyfriend out of the car.
327342 328169 Ok?
330661 331580 Hey, Lucy, babe...
331711 333938 Come on, get in the car. Let's just go.<br />No, no.
334676 336087 Will both of you just go away?
336089 337456 Just talk to me for a minute,<br />Lucy...
337458 339950 I'm tired. I'm going to bed. Alone.
340049 341858 You're damn right<br />you're going to bed alone.
344127 346026 Lucy, honey, wait a minute,<br />just wait, honey.
346028 347021 I want to talk to you.
347022 348316 Just wait.<br />Dad...
349266 350758 when I want to talk to you,
351183 353304 if I want to talk to you.
354677 355897 I'll call you.
356619 357398 Lucy.
357483 359322 Wait, Lucy. Lucy!
360333 361413 Lucy McClane!
361458 362632 It's not McClane,

416641 418487 I'm staring at exactly where you are.
419156 420958 So that's not something<br />I would turn on?
421123 422203 Yeah, we did that.
422456 423313 John, we...
423742 424913 turned them on. Listen...

1167671 1169255 Really? This is you being scared?
1169363 1171530 Because you seem really calm.
1172708 1174425 Have you done stuff like that before?
1174878 1176088 Stuff like what?
1177243 1178422 Like killing people.
1180117 1180865 Yeah.

1184606 1186394 So who were those guys?
1186791 1187936 Why were they trying to kill you?
1187938 1189726 Why did they blow up<br />my goddamn apartment?
1191390 1192754 They were there to kill you.
1194473 1195917 Why would they want to kill me?
1196311 1197678 You tell me, kid.
1198072 1199352 You're the criminal.
1214979 1216540 I got seven dead hackers so far,
1216542 1217964 none of whom were high on our list.
1219327 1220690 Collect the hard drives,<br />start sweeping them.
1220692 1221319 Yes, sir.

1237276 1238709 Operational prudence.
1240199 1242491 Think of them as hardware<br />to your software.

1275454 1276630 It's Creedence.
1276754 1277688 Creedence?
1277912 1278631 Creedence.
1278703 1280383 Creedence Clearwater Revival.
1281019 1281931 Classic rock.
1281933 1282988 I know who it is.
1283011 1285263 It's old rock,<br />that doesn't make it classic.
1285285 1287367 What sucked back then still sucks now.
1287564 1288491 You don't like Creedence?
1288585 1291203 This is like having a pine-cone<br />shoved in my ass.
1292208 1293496 Ok. Really?
1293637 1294802 That's mature.
1295370 1297266 Come on, man.<br />I'm cooperating with you.
1299856 1302027 <i>We're at a heading of zero-six-zero.</i>
1302262 1303554 <i>Making another pass.</i>
1306831 1307979 Listen up, everyone.
1308615 1309434 Are we ready?
1310336 1312212 Transportation hubs<br />are prepped and set.
1313416 1314575 Begin stage one.
1348422 1350515 When's the last time you remember<br />turning on the radio
1350517 1351578 and listening to popular music?
1351656 1352866 Just give me a decade.
1354126 1355060 The '70s?
1355826 1357781 I'm guessing was<br />Michael Jackson still black?
1358387 1360431 Pearl Jam I'll go back ten years with you,
1360649 1361473 ten years.
1361598 1363447 20 years, The Cure? Nothing?
1363540 1364772 It's called news radio.
1365648 1368828 I was trying to see if any of your<br />friends from Camden made the headlines.
1368830 1369661 Hold on...
1370414 1371665 you listen to the news.
1371667 1373126 You got a problem with the news now?
1374499 1375214 Yeah,
1375339 1377743 I got a big goddamn problem<br />with the news.
1377800 1379242 You ready for this? The news...
1379307 1381113 is completely manipulated.
1381523 1383183 Everything you hear,
1383223 1384692 every single day,
1384730 1387224 is designed by corporate<br />media to do one thing,
1387286 1388197 and one thing only.
1388260 1390367 Jesus.<br />- To keep you living in fear.
1390385 1391077 Oh, fear?
1391079 1391886 Total fear!
1391972 1393792 Fear so you'll go out and<br />you'll spend money on things.
1393885 1394878 Things you probably don't even need.
1394880 1396221 Things you probably<br />already have six of
1396339 1398978 so that their advertisers keep<br />buying ads on their stations.
1399009 1400324 Say you one more thing,<br />are you ready for this?
1400326 1402723 I'll do this all day, man.<br />I got days of data at home.
1402725 1403734 You don't believe me. I'll give...<br />Hey!
1403736 1404819 I'll drop a bomb on you bigger...
1404821 1405973 Hey!<br />What? What?
1405975 1407173 Shut up.
1407175 1408801 That's good. That's good.<br />Be dismissive...
1462211 1463041 You alright?
1463139 1464382 No, I'm not alright!
1465567 1467253 Just stay in the car.<br />You'll be alright.
1470787 1471505 Hey, man.
1471670 1472316 Hey.
1473638 1474719 How you doing?<br />You alright?
1474783 1476724 Don't move.<br />Just call 911, alright?
1476726 1477431 Ok.
1480521 1481542 Jesus Christ.
1502736 1504103 All the lights are green.
1505588 1506983 All the lights are green.<br />Let's go.
1507006 1508215 Let's go, right now.
1508217 1509082 We got to go?<br />Let's go.
1509720 1511629 Get your bag, hack boy.<br />Let's go.
1513342 1514727 Jesus Christ.<br />Let's go.
1514729 1516680 I've never been in a car accident.<br />Come on. You alright? Well...
1516682 1518617 Very exciting.<br />Here we go, this way, come on.
1518680 1519762 Here we go. Here we go.<br />Ever been in a car acc...
1519764 1521681 Yeah, I've been in a car accident.<br />What are we doing?
1521833 1524558 It's a little thing they invented<br />back in the '60s called jogging.
1524581 1525813 You're gonna love it. Come on.
1536144 1539780 Sir, Chicago's reporting a system crash<br />on their I train network.
1543733 1546833 Amtrak is flashing a level-one<br />crash in their comm system.
1547331 1548915 F.A.A. just issued a critical alert.
1548953 1550545 Their A.T.C. net just went down.
1551455 1552819 We're under attack.
1554971 1555526 Ok.
1555881 1557901 Let's get them outside<br />for a little fresh air.
1568947 1570611 That's the anthrax alarm.
1573194 1574660 Alright, everyone out, now!
1574907 1575691 Now!
1578922 1580144 Taylor, move, go!
1580425 1581225 Move!
1596951 1599233 <i>All personnel must evacuate<br />and proceed</i>
1599347 1601859 <i>to the transportation<br />shuttles immediately.</i>
1601976 1603388 <i>This is not a drill.</i>
1604020 1606637 <i>All personnel must evacuate<br />and proceed</i>
1606731 1609026 <i>to the transportation<br />shuttles immediately.</i>
1629462 1630581 We need you inside.
1636886 1637968 Take the team.
1637969 1639549 I want men on the fourth floor, got it?
1639551 1640286 Masks on.
1643893 1645185 Got to know what's there, ok?
1645530 1647331 Why don't you run a search<br />on these data crashes?
1647625 1649376 See if we can I.D. the point of origin.
1651963 1653328 Begin stage two.
1660451 1661826 Hey, what's going on?
1661911 1663286 Hey, what's going on?<br />No!
1669512 1670872 They're already starting to panic.
1675010 1675901 Of course they are.
1677259 1679285 They think that someone's<br />taking their money.
1680082 1682841 All those nickels and dimes<br />they saved have meaning.
1683616 1685502 Useful idiots, as Lenin would say.
1687659 1689090 Prep the video package.
1702467 1704646 D.C. transportation system's crashing,
1704648 1707570 and they just hit the entire financial<br />sector, everything, all of it.
1707757 1709084 Get me the Secretary of Trans
1709086 1711480 and Treasury on the line and<br />the chairman for the S.E.C.
1712369 1713535 Let's go, people!
1713686 1716150 Somewhere, somebody<br />left a digital fingerprint.
1716278 1716965 Find it!
1717673 1719315 Is Deputy Director Bowman in here?
1719317 1720561 Not now. It'll have to wait.
1720580 1721937 Not today, waxworks.
1722257 1723524 This is Matthew Farrell.
1723526 1725321 I brought him here<br />on direct orders from Bowman.
1725375 1728001 So if you don't know what the hell's<br />going on go find me somebody that does.
1728106 1729029 I'm Bowman.
1735367 1737173 Video package is ready for upload.
1741753 1742810 Thanks.<br />Listen John.
1742812 1745243 Appreciate you bringing Farrell here,<br />but everything's changed this morning.
1745245 1746932 We are neck-deep in damage control.
1747250 1748367 Excuse me. I'm sorry, sir.
1748866 1751135 Do you have anything to eat,<br />any kind of snacks around?
1751493 1752512 I would love...
1752762 1753996 really low blood sugar and...
1753998 1754805 Sir.
1755541 1756323 No?
1759809 1762262 <i>As if the nationwide<br />transportation breakdown</i>
1762264 1764647 <i>and anthrax scares<br />weren't enough for one day.</i>
1764883 1767757 <i>The stock market found itself in<br />a selling frenzy this afternoon.</i>
1768170 1770376 <i>The Federal Trade Commission<br />believes this panic</i>

1774740 1776626 Oh, man, that is all bad.
1776649 1777731 <i>A terrorist attack.</i>
1777943 1779151 Not as bad as it looks.
1779153 1781029 We run drills to prepare<br />for things like this.
1782995 1784743 These your suspects?<br />Were.
1784867 1787339 All seven were killed<br />in the last 24 hours.
1789368 1790825 Recognize any of these people?
1793425 1794147 No.
1794798 1795691 Not one?
1796691 1797417 Sir.
1798210 1799460 Got a system error.
1810961 1812540 <i>My fellow Americans,</i>

1865382 1866946 I don't know how they're getting in.
1867884 1868714 <i>Thank you.</i>
1869076 1872007 <i>And a happy Independence<br />Day to everyone.</i>
1875583 1876952 That was creepy.
1877530 1879197 I tried to find more Nixon.
1880121 1881335 Think they bought it?
1882108 1883382 Absolutely.
1886802 1888642 Ok, I want telecom,
1888674 1890363 transportation, any and every...
1890410 1892120 Jesus Christ, it's a fire sale.
1892306 1893084 What?
1893963 1895606 It's a fire sale.
1896025 1896741 Hey!
1897104 1898135 We don't know that yet.
1898157 1899781 Yeah, it's a myth, anyway.<br />Can't be done.
1899783 1901112 Oh, it's a myth? Really?
1901744 1904289 Please tell me she's only here for show and<br />she's actually not in charge of anything.
1904320 1905454 What's a fire sale?
1905986 1907111 It's a three step.
1907548 1910733 It's a three step systematic attack on<br />the entire national infrastructure.
1911014 1911866 Ok, step one,
1911899 1913283 take out all the transportation.
1913419 1915310 Step two, the financial base<br />and telecoms.
1915674 1917348 Step three, you get rid<br />of all the utilities,
1917369 1919117 gas, water, electric, nuclear.
1919256 1921054 Pretty much anything<br />that's run by computers,
1921056 1923337 which, which today is almost everything.
1923766 1926488 So that's why they call it a fire sale,<br />because everything must go.
1926848 1928118 Hey, listen, listen.
1928135 1929536 What's your name?<br />Farrell?
1929996 1931227 Keep your voice down, ok?
1931680 1933623 No one here's talking about a fire sale.
1933715 1936476 Not unless you're telling me<br />you helped plan one.
1938251 1939736 What?<br />No man, I'm just saying...
1940193 1941647 to explain...<br />Appreciate your concern.
1941649 1943203 We know what we're doing, we're on it.<br />Thank you.
1943205 1944794 You've done a bang-up job so far.<br />What?
1945515 1946190 Bang...<br />What?
1946192 1947951 Nothing. I get...<br />I said I understand.
1949002 1949725 Hey.
1949934 1952093 They didn't send the Girl Scouts<br />out to get this kid.
1952558 1955169 They sent professional guys,<br />full tactical gear.
1955205 1956462 They blew the whole joint up.
1956464 1958116 Now look, I don't know this kid.
1958295 1960653 And frankly, I don't give a shit.<br />No offense.
1961111 1962723 But somebody wants this kid dead.
1963375 1966641 And obviously, it's got something<br />to do with whatever is going on here.
1968042 1968760 Ok.
1969131 1971731 Homeland's taking over the interrogation<br />of the hackers we're bringing in.
1971733 1973192 I'll get you an escort over there.
1973417 1974209 Alright?
1974713 1976466 Molina, get this kid<br />to the front of the line.
1976943 1978193 I want to know what he knows.
1980062 1981684 If that guy knew half<br />the shit that I know,
1981818 1983106 his fuzzy little head would explode.
1983888 1986050 Special Agent Johnson.<br />We'll take the sedan.
1986133 1987203 Agent Johnson?
1987448 1988368 That's right.
1988945 1989986 Right this way.
1990082 1990715 Great.
1992282 1994743 So, is any of that actually possible,<br />what you were saying back there?
1994745 1995600 Is it possible?
1995965 1997094 Here look, I'm gonna tell you again.
1997096 1999604 You take out any one thing,<br />the system can recover, right?
1999606 2000904 If you take it all down at once,
2000905 2002232 the system crashes and...
2002587 2004078 Look around, man!
2004682 2005433 Come on.
2006041 2008884 Government's got to have dozens<br />of departments dedicated to that shit.
2009382 2012773 It took FEMA five days<br />to get water to the Superdome.

2056589 2057830 Close that loop now.
2058336 2059371 Isolate the frequency.
2059627 2062827 Get us a location on the vehicles<br />and pull me up a file on this John McClane.
2064422 2065084 <i>Rand?</i>
2065086 2067297 <i>We just found Farrell.<br />Stand by for a location.</i>
2071303 2072046 Look at there.
2072068 2073364 I don't mean to harp guys but,
2073365 2075832 we just passed another Arby's<br />and I'm starving.
2075834 2077404 I... I could eat a wrapper.<br />Later. Shut up.
2077415 2078902 You don't even have to order anything.<br />Shut up.
2078920 2080440 Just get some ketchup packets.<br />Shut up.
2081156 2083680 You got about 14 minutes to tell me<br />why you lied to me back there.
2084043 2084882 Lied to you?
2084883 2086270 What are you...<br />What are you talking about?
2086488 2088249 The pictures on the wall.<br />You knew those guys, right?
2088833 2089556 I don't...
2090284 2091576 Kid, don't lie to me.
2091660 2093529 I'm a cop. I can tell you're lying.
2093749 2094671 Who were they?
2097707 2098342 Ok.
2099325 2100211 Ok. Ok.
2102943 2104333 They were my competition.
2108176 2109728 Make the next right onto Concord.
2110673 2112083 They said they were a software firm
2112085 2114180 and had developed a mutating<br />encryption algorithm,
2114182 2115815 and they just wanted<br />to see if it could be cracked.
2116685 2119162 That's what I do. I do...<br />I. I do math-based security.
2124442 2125472 Here's the thing.
2125473 2127485 The thing that I've been<br />thinking about is,
2127486 2129386 as massive and crazy as a fire sale,
2129621 2131613 you'd need tons of start-up guys<br />to write the programs,
2131615 2133357 but only a few black hats<br />to actually implement it,
2133436 2135494 So then at that point the start-up guys,
2135496 2137725 the guys who haven't<br />really done anything wrong,
2137726 2138314 like me...
2138316 2140321 Would end up as pictures<br />on some guy's wall.
2140625 2142269 I swear to God, McClane,
2142270 2145209 I swear to you I had no idea<br />I was gonna be...
2146443 2149020 an accessory to, to Armageddon.
2149719 2151515 Take the next left at Lexington.
2151804 2153488 Man, that's a sexy voice.
2154349 2155975 What's she taking us this way for?
2156058 2157861 <i>Unit 510, this is dispatch.</i><br />Oh, my God.

2163941 2164742 Her who?
2165210 2166265 What are you talking about?
2168112 2169007 It's them.
2169008 2170267 You're saying it's them, them?
2170394 2172069 I swear to you I know her.
2172389 2173973 I would know her voice anywhere.
2175690 2177819 Don't say anything, don't...<br />Just keep your mouth shut for a minute.
2180082 2182622 Hey Metro, how's your day<br />going over there?
2182673 2183775 <i>Yeah, got to be pretty,</i>
2183791 2186502 <i>crazy over there,<br />what with all those 587s?</i>
2187256 2189401 Yes, sir. We've had to dispatch all units.
2191427 2194698 You had to dispatch all units for all<br />the naked people walking around?
2195872 2198204 Cut the bullshit, honey,<br />and just put your boss on.
2201168 2204463 Laughlin, we're getting off this route.<br />Turn left on 14th Street.
2213491 2214736 Officer McClane.
2215068 2217125 It's Detective McClane, asshole.
2217578 2219527 Don't worry. We'll have plenty of time
2219528 2220552 to get to know each other
2220553 2221907 <i>when I visit you in prison.</i>
2222876 2224284 But, John,
2224413 2226213 I already know so much about you.
2226644 2227974 Your address in Brooklyn,
2228288 2229643 <i>the payments on your mortgage,</i>
2230005 2232506 <i>how long you've been<br />a member of the NYPD.</i>
2233262 2234639 <i>And how's Holly?</i>
2235097 2236174 That's sad.
2236175 2237268 You're divorced.
2237362 2239444 Was that tough on little Jack and Lucy?
2241353 2242433 <i>Now, this is sad.</i>
2242434 2243584 After 30 years I thought,
2243585 2245861 <i>you'd have a better pension plan<br />annuity than what I see here.</i>
2247526 2248819 And it gets worse.
2251947 2253822 Your 401K no longer exists.
2255117 2256960 I tell you what.<br />Let me make it up to you.
2257504 2259077 Box them in at that intersection.
2259838 2261641 Shoot Mr Farrell in the head,
2261873 2262871 <i>and drive away,</i>
2262873 2265036 by the time you reach<br />the end of the next block.
2265586 2267150 <i>All your debts will be wiped clean,</i>
2267915 2270059 <i>and your children will be set for life.</i>
2271258 2274242 Now, that really is tempting,<br />especially that last part.
2274823 2276696 But I think I'm gonna have to pass, jerk-off.
2279057 2280039 John,
2280670 2283395 you're a Timex watch in a digital age.
2283478 2284695 <i>You're gonna lose.</i>
2285397 2286507 <i>Yeah, well...</i>
2286881 2289187 <i>the other thing that could happen<br />is I could come and find you,</i>
2289359 2291558 kick your ass and throw<br />you out of your own party.
2291559 2292946 <i>What do you think about that,<br />dickhead?</i>
2293084 2294322 Hold your position.
2297660 2298746 He's not responding.
2302469 2304915 Get down! Get down!<br />Get right down!
2310166 2311300 Just stay down!
2315762 2316606 Officers down.
2316661 2319363 <i>At the corner of Main and Constitution.<br />I repeat. Officers down.</i>
2337348 2339329 Come on, come on, get out!<br />Let's go! Let's go!
2341829 2342857 Goddammit!
2343335 2344363 Just stay down!
2350405 2351323 Get down!
2352042 2353072 Just hang on!
2363017 2365446 Base, we've got a squad car under fire.<br />We need backup.
2365448 2366798 <i>I repeat. We need backup!</i>
2366900 2368457 This is base. We're sending backup.
2374102 2375112 Just brace yourself.
2391644 2392629 Hang on. Hang on.
2409607 2410466 Hang on.
2420910 2421855 Yeah!
2427583 2429410 <i>We lost Del.</i><br />Stay with them.
2440179 2441615 They're back.<br />I know.
2445101 2446305 Take the tunnel, left, left, left.
2452984 2454778 God, what are you...<br />Oh, God!
2463463 2464956 Bring up the schematics on that tunnel.
2465759 2466630 The tunnel!
2476558 2478449 Open the gates on<br />the north side entrance.
2486335 2488337 Redirect traffic, to occupy all lanes.
2505464 2506719 Now open the other side.
2506798 2507690 What?
2508132 2508863 Move.
2513946 2515208 Hang onto something.
2552175 2554208 Hey! Hey!<br />Don't get out of the car!
2554427 2555044 Hey!
2562428 2564336 Just stay there. Stand still.
2574774 2576409 Run. Run.
2584116 2585115 Oh, God.
2590657 2592413 Don't ever hesitate like that again.
2594544 2595296 Are you alright?
2595297 2596917 Yeah, yeah.
2601218 2603741 Just stay here. Stay<br />right here for a minute.
2603862 2604549 What?
2604551 2606108 It can't be a uniform, John.
2606609 2607220 No.
2607933 2609339 Get over to the wall, sir!
2609463 2611173 Feds called in a favor!
2613272 2614362 All you got to do,
2614663 2616832 is go pick up a kid down in Jersey,
2617284 2618864 drive him down to DC.
2619115 2620402 How hard can that be?
2620917 2622413 It can't be that hard, no can it?
2623740 2625348 No, got to be a senior detective.
2631582 2632917 A thing like a traffic jam,
2633407 2635727 throwing a car at me<br />is gonna stop me?
2636187 2637881 Rand, get in there, get it done.
2638171 2639660 <i>No need. He comes to us.</i>
2652227 2653793 This is not a good idea.
2693126 2695078 Don't touch me, don't touch me.<br />Ok, sorry, sorry.
2695605 2697664 Are you Ok? Oh, my God.
2700652 2701908 Pretty lucky shot.
2701909 2703182 Yeah, lucky.
2703183 2704195 That was...
2704447 2706699 You just killed a helicopter with a car.
2706783 2708128 I was out of bullets.
2711602 2712544 How you doing
2712854 2715652 I skinned my knee,<br />my asthma's acting up...
2717335 2718909 Whatever. Yeah, I'm fine.
2718984 2721679 Give me a hand.<br />Don't jump outta cars.
2732305 2733633 <i>Rand, check in.</i>
2735166 2736432 Chopper down.
2737063 2738612 What about Farrell and McClane?
2740749 2741749 That is history.
2742236 2743202 Come back in.
2743445 2744691 Ok, we're moving on.
2744692 2745627 Begin stage three.
2745656 2746755 I just spoke to Emerson.
2747330 2749125 The team's arriving at Woodlawn now.
2749127 2749905 Very good.
2750868 2752700 Mai, get ready for the downloads.
2760462 2761327 ID, sir.
2763048 2764989 Park behind the transpo.<br />We'll lead you in.
2765272 2766286 Man the gate.
2766287 2767316 You're with me.
2774593 2777606 Anthrax alarms only<br />went off on five floors.
2777608 2779669 Below that, you'll need DOD clearance.
2780608 2782584 I don't know why<br />you'd need to go further.
2782586 2784534 There's nothing down there but servers.
2790462 2792113 <i>Go again. Rodriguez?</i>
2793315 2794470 <i>I didn't copy.</i>
2809303 2810253 Gate secured.
2810356 2811096 Copy.
2820857 2821942 Ok, we are in.
2856739 2857812 This is insane.
2858099 2858638 Hey.
2859361 2860668 Hey, this is absurd.
2861147 2863092 Man, there is tough and there is stupid.
2863330 2864497 You got to go to a hospital.
2864973 2866018 Look at you.
2867028 2868974 I'm not a doctor,<br />but you look like you're hurt.
2869126 2869891 Yeah.
2869998 2871118 Sexy, right?<br />No.
2871201 2872102 Come on.
2872659 2874385 We don't need a doctor.<br />We need the cops.
2903487 2904366 He's in.
2906027 2908669 Get outta the way.<br />Make a hole, please. Come on.
2908905 2910232 Watch out. Excuse me.
2910233 2912090 Excuse me. Come on.
2913179 2915235 NYPD. Alright? I got this kid.
2915236 2916621 Come on. Let's go, kid.
2922168 2923819 Excuse me. Thanks.
2924045 2925011 NYPD.
2925582 2926823 Coming through.
2928589 2929418 Sergeant?
2930009 2930909 Sergeant.
2931617 2932770 I need to speak to you.
2933206 2934983 The medic's in the back.<br />I'm alright.
2934984 2936949 NYPD. I need to talk to you.
2938264 2939575 Just give me a minute.
2940467 2941439 Sergeant.
2946400 2947717 Oh, my God.
2954181 2955366 Let's get outta here.
2968219 2969077 For soon.
2970336 2971412 We're a go.
2972401 2973574 Launch the downloads.
2984063 2985197 Nothing's happening.
2986104 2986922 Be patient.
2988986 2990642 I don't know. It's not responding.
2991252 2992399 Wait for it.
2997619 2998371 See?
2999059 3000117 There you go.
3001873 3003802 Tell me when the download<br />reaches 20%.
3003804 3004794 Ok.
3012009 3012989 Excuse me.
3015017 3015928 Excuse me.
3015929 3016790 Thank you.
3016791 3018088 Holy shit.
3019391 3020137 Kid?
3020483 3021801 Kid, hey?<br />Yeah, yeah.
3021808 3023173 You got a phone in that bag?<br />Yeah.
3024354 3025231 Come on. Let's go.
3029651 3031922 And here you go, Agent Tovarek.
3031923 3033084 Guess that's you.
3055845 3057437 Download's at 20%.
3057684 3058803 Time to move.
3059098 3060909 Let's keep them chasing their tails.
3077033 3081783 <i>Due to recent activity, law enforcement<br />agencies are being cautious.</i>
3082080 3086168 <i>They are telling drivers to abandon<br />their vehicles until they are searched.</i>
3086626 3087890 <i>And as you can see,</i>
3087891 3090630 <i>canine units are checking each vehicle.</i>
3090713 3094150 <i>Now, whether this is connected to<br />the anthrax reports we heard earlier</i>
3094173 3096799 <i>or for some new terrorist threat,<br />we do not know.</i>
3096801 3098490 F.A.A. just grounded all flights.
3098491 3099220 Good.
3099222 3101603 Sir. We have complete access<br />over system networks.
3101692 3103767 Phones, power grids, water, nuclear.
3105056 3106058 Hey. Excuse me.
3106060 3107197 Jack Parry, N.S.A.
3107392 3109297 Chuck Summer, D.H.S. liaison.
3109449 3110667 White House made the call.
3110875 3112285 Anything you need, we're here to help.
3112286 3113009 Help?
3113875 3114940 That's. That's great.
3114989 3117198 We're gonna need some work space<br />for our people.
3117517 3118909 What can you do for us?
3119827 3122150 Well, as you can see<br />we're using the space,
3122151 3125082 so you guys can stand<br />in the corner and liaise.
3125165 3126207 If I need something,
3126864 3128081 I'll just wave to you.
3150924 3152819 Wait. No, no. Don't, don't call.<br />Why. Why?
3153272 3155149 What are you talking about?<br />They probably cracked that hours ago.
3155150 3156643 You use it, they might be able<br />to trace us here.
3157214 3158211 Just put it in your pocket.<br />You sure?
3158212 3158899 Yes.
3159398 3161696 Or smash it.<br />You didn't have to smash it.
3162912 3164345 Excuse me. Excuse me.<br />Hey!
3164346 3165507 It's a police emergency.<br />Hey!
3165748 3167042 He'll call you right back.
3168876 3169818 Here, right in here.
3171438 3172388 You got a signal?
3175132 3175735 Yeah.
3175736 3177521 This is John McClane<br />for Agent Bowman.
3178385 3179964 Sir, John McClane is on the line.
3181795 3184098 McClane, go.<br />We never made it to D.H.S.
3184267 3185586 <i>They came after the kid again.</i>
3185750 3186782 All your men are down.
3189731 3190616 What about Farrell?
3190698 3192401 Yeah. I got him with me right now.
3192692 3193440 Sir?
3193986 3194778 Hang on, John.
3194780 3195743 Yeah, I'll hold on.
3201534 3203161 Another day in paradise.
3203382 3206034 They just swarmed into<br />everything the telecom system,
3206035 3208458 phones, cells, broadcast, satellites.
3220777 3222357 They're blanketing every station.
3249791 3251064 Can you put the news back on?
3251065 3252352 This is the news.
3252915 3254030 It's on every channel.
3254254 3255948 Been this way for a few minutes now.
3273927 3274932 Oh, my God.
3283147 3284064 McClane.
3285854 3286516 Look out.
3287288 3287933 Look out.
3289869 3290584 Look out.
3293210 3294009 Bowman?
3294121 3295227 <i>Bowman, do you see that?</i>
3295594 3297485 Bowman, it's a fake.
3301795 3302801 I see it.
3304384 3305235 Thank God.
3307934 3308585 Shit.
3309852 3310566 McClane?
3310754 3311646 Bowman.
3317401 3318452 Satellite's down.
3318453 3319660 Get me a land line.
3335045 3337498 I wrote one little piece of<br />code and the world falls apart.
3339002 3340675 This is virtual terrorism.
3340697 3341273 What?
3341445 3342425 You know, it's crazy.
3342427 3344814 The first time I heard of the concept<br />of a fire sale
3345597 3348559 I actually thought it would be cool<br />if anyone ever really did it.
3349685 3350415 Just...
3350772 3352327 hit the reset button and...
3353185 3354922 melt the system just for fun.
3355411 3355942 Hey?
3356309 3357495 It's not a system.
3357926 3358892 It's a country.
3359069 3360194 You're talking about people,
3360195 3362047 Alright? A whole country full of people,
3362447 3365447 sitting at home, alone, scared to death<br />in their houses, alright?
3366076 3367734 So if you're done with<br />your little nostalgic moment,
3367735 3368975 maybe you can think a little bit,
3369158 3370461 and help me catch these guys.
3372470 3373451 Just help me.
3373823 3375327 Just put yourself in their shoes.
3377398 3378388 Come on little kid.
3378390 3380297 If this were your fire sale<br />you were running this thing,
3380299 3381297 what would be your next move?
3381383 3381976 Ok.
3383979 3385849 The whole point of a fire sale is that it's...
3385850 3387571 it's mostly done by remote, right?<br />But...
3388449 3390315 But not everything is<br />run completely online...
3391060 3392187 Major utilities aren't.
3392352 3393637 They're run by closed circuits, so...
3394303 3396589 you could breach the security up<br />to a certain point but...
3397606 3399199 to shut it down you'd have<br />to physically go there.
3399201 3400231 You'd have to show up.
3400369 3401586 Right, and, and...
3403323 3404634 Give me that guy's PDA.
3404635 3406135 The phones don't work.<br />They're all dead.
3406356 3408284 No, the phones are fine;<br />It's the network that's dead.
3408380 3411645 And I've just got to reprogram it<br />and link it into the old Satcoms.
3412020 3413343 Hackers surf them all the time.
3413567 3415801 Probably what these guys<br />are using to talk to each other.
3416294 3417683 How do you know all this stuff?
3418129 3419360 Dude, I don't know.
3419867 3422081 There's a lot rattling around<br />up there. I couldn't tell you.
3422550 3423392 Ok.
3423876 3424938 National power grid.
3425283 3427321 Gas and electric is divided<br />into three zones, right?
3427323 3428829 Eastern, central and western,
3429015 3430206 each with a primary hub.
3431290 3432312 Here it is.
3434896 3436027 What is that?<br />What are we looking at?
3436195 3437465 That is the Eastern hub.
3438019 3439255 Now, they take this out,
3440450 3442829 wipes out all the power for<br />the entire Eastern Corridor.
3443363 3444942 But again, you'd have to do it manually.
3445788 3446323 Ok.
3448147 3450231 Come on. Let's go.<br />What? To West Virginia?
3451517 3453894 I honestly don't think I can handle<br />any more people trying to kill me.
3453895 3454958 McClane? McClane?
3455041 3456060 You get used to it.
3456151 3457335 McClane. Shit.
3457663 3459308 Sir, wireless networks are down,
3459475 3460954 and I think they're hitting<br />the land lines, too.
3462098 3464511 I don't care how, you find me a line.
3465638 3466752 Come on, what you got?
3466882 3469730 We swept the whole building. Seems clean.<br />We can sweep it again.
3469732 3471705 I don't think we're gonna find anything.<br />Don't bother. Don't bother.
3473282 3474318 It's a fake.
3474945 3476203 This guy's playing us.
3476896 3479473 Ok, get everyone back inside<br />the crisis centre now.
3479650 3480987 Ok, let's open it up.
3484196 3485480 Come on, get in.
3485816 3486872 Door's locked.
3487616 3489458 Unless you have an extra gun<br />I can use to unlock it.
3492955 3494836 Hey! Hey don't do that. Hey!
3494837 3496166 You're gonna disable it.<br />Shit
3497418 3498743 Jesus Christ!
3500296 3501584 That was crazy. Did you see that?
3502178 3503257 Sorry about that, man.
3503547 3505030 I didn't know<br />it would come out so fast.
3507694 3509655 Man, this is a pain in the ass.
3509657 3511143 How'd you do yours?
3514275 3515273 You alright?
3515526 3517158 What'd you... What, it hit you<br />a little bit?
3517477 3518190 Sorry.
3522122 3524497 Oh, no, listen, do not please<br />don't touch those, ok?
3524505 3526166 I know what I'm doing.<br />I've done this before
3526723 3528350 I mean, I've read about it.
3529928 3532629 <i>Road Assist. We've detected<br />an air-bag deployment.</i>
3532912 3533713 Yes...
3533823 3537458 Please, we just hit a tree and<br />my dad is having a heart attack.
3537541 3538617 I think he's gonna die.
3538749 3539834 You need to help us.
3540085 3542239 <i>Hold while we contact emergency services.</i>
3542801 3543861 No, no, no, he's...
3543862 3545214 He's dying. Please, listen to me.
3545216 3547829 I can get him to a<br />hospital. I can drive. I'm fine.
3548025 3550471 But I can't really turn the key,<br />the key won't start.
3550517 3553158 So you got to start us, ok?<br />Please, Dad...
3553266 3554349 <i>Your name, please?</i>
3554789 3555894 I'm...
3556496 3559810 My name is... Frank,
3559940 3562522 and my dad's name is...
3563844 3564719 is...
3565853 3569241 Dvorak Tsajanski.
3570575 3571447 Please...
3571448 3573827 Please, just help us ok.<br />We need your help. Please.
3574496 3576494 <i>Emergency services are on their way.</i>
3576634 3578542 No, no, hold on, listen to me.<br />Listen to me ma'am.
3578636 3579521 What is your name?
3579668 3581133 <i>Dolores</i>.<br />Dolores?
3581295 3583698 Ok Dolores,<br />I don't know if you have a dad,
3583918 3586528 but I do and I wanna be able<br />to say that a year from now.
3586715 3588342 Ok because my dad is my hero,
3588343 3590927 and right now he is in my arms dying,
3591123 3592496 and his only hope,
3592650 3595430 is to get to a hospital<br />right now. We can't wait.
3595555 3597617 So please start the goddamn car.
3602440 3603664 Thank you, Dolores.
3604184 3605305 Pass the PDA.
3605523 3606859 I got to call the Warlock.
3606861 3607999 The what? The Warlock.
3608000 3610140 A digital Jedi. He's amazing.
3628217 3629929 Ma'am, you're not authorised<br />to be here.
3629931 3632040 FBI. We suspect a security breach.<br />No.
3632096 3633628 No, you can't land here without authoriza...
3654410 3656023 That was pretty good back there, kid.
3657323 3658291 Thanks.
3659359 3660521 What's the matter with you?
3661062 3662585 Nothing else to complain about?
3662668 3664135 No. I'm just...
3665254 3666593 Well, what?<br />What's the matter with you?
3666870 3668230 It's not funny.<br />I'm not like you.
3668231 3669814 I can't. I can't do this shit.
3670051 3671922 What do you mean? What's that mean? Like what?
3672678 3675345 I'm not like...<br />Like heroic and everything.
3675346 3676857 I'm not brave like you are.
3677516 3679510 I'm not that guy.<br />I'm nobody's hero, kid.
3680050 3682939 You saved my life, like,<br />ten times in the last six hours.
3683022 3684683 Just doing my job, that's all.
3687652 3689349 Know what you get for being a hero?
3689719 3690550 Nothing.
3690900 3691919 You get shot at.
3692740 3694577 You get a little pat on the back,<br />blah-blah-blah.
3694890 3695847 Attaboy.
3699354 3700961 You get divorced.
3701792 3703717 A wife that can't remember<br />your last name.
3704962 3706732 Your kids don't wanna talk to you.
3708632 3710592 You get to eat a lot of meals by yourself.
3711885 3713889 Trust me kid, nobody wants<br />to be that guy.
3716014 3717252 Then why are you doing this?
3717372 3719844 Because there is nobody else<br />to do it right now, that's why.
3720258 3721148 Believe me,
3721150 3723834 if there was somebody else to do it,<br />I would let them do it, but there is not.
3723979 3725188 So we're doing it.
3728110 3729759 And that's what makes you that guy.
3739288 3740649 Thing's flying now.
3741373 3743196 Contact Emerson.<br />Tell him we'll be there soon.
3750770 3753311 What the hell are you doing?<br />This whole floor's restricted acc...
3779232 3780467 Stay here.
3810602 3811705 Alright, come on.
3831081 3832845 We're in.<br /><i>Good. Shut it down.</i>
3844811 3846243 Guess you were right, kid.
3846933 3849266 Ok, that's awful.
3852069 3853175 We got company.
3862636 3864267 So, how would they shut<br />down a power grid?
3864268 3865055 What?
3865057 3865827 Come on.
3867102 3868825 Central control room. Ok...
3871432 3873276 Fourth floor. Fourth floor.<br />Come on.
3876699 3877870 You take the right.
3884868 3885714 Shit.
3887898 3889675 I'm gonna stop here for...<br />Just try to keep up.
3889677 3892495 I am keeping up. I just want to stop<br />for two seconds to catch a breath.
3892794 3894783 You know, they have these things<br />called gymnasiums.
3894785 3895847 Oh yes, it's not like they're...
3916951 3918025 Come on, let's go.
3918854 3919790 Let's go.
3932108 3934685 Intel's fairly certain<br />that the terrorists are mobile.
3934903 3937643 It's the only way to consistently<br />avoid signal triangulation,
3938101 3940047 and judging by the amount of hardware<br />they're running,
3940155 3941215 we're probably looking for a...
3941552 3942532 for a large vehicle,
3942970 3944614 most likely a semitrailer rig.
3944894 3945590 Alright.
3945903 3947605 Tell the guys at Homeland Security
3947731 3949314 we need every agent, satellite
3949463 3950914 and functioning network they got.
3950915 3951669 Now.
3971231 3972527 Play time's over, sweetheart.
3972750 3973544 Don't.
3974157 3975491 Take your hand off the gun.
3975896 3976769 Hands up.
3977427 3978410 Stand up.
3985623 3986740 Go on. Now.
3988248 3989491 Let's go, kid.
3989492 3990396 You're up.
3991084 3991831 Ok.
3994338 3995510 As fast as you can.
3995511 3995965 Hey!
3999010 3999735 Jesus!
4016944 4018838 That's enough of this kung fu, shit.
4018840 4021909 I've known some bitches<br />in my day, but you...
4022088 4023289 are maybe the...
4028664 4029577 Still awake?
4030750 4032540 Just keep doing what you're doing.
4032541 4033002 Ok.
4033004 4033935 How much time do you need?
4034826 4035893 Not much.
4048761 4049604 Are you done?
4050611 4051370 I...
4051538 4053579 Are you done?<br />No, no, no, no, not quite.
4053587 4054267 What?
4054268 4056590 I'm not exactly checking<br />my e-mail here, you know?
4058027 4060586 They ran this hack in V.M.O.,<br />so I'm isolating their A.P.I.,
4060587 4061901 and just booting the host.<br />What?
4061902 4063760 It means about 30 seconds, ok?
4065323 4066914 Not the easiest thing to do when...
4080175 4080639 Ok.
4083130 4084891 Undo everything you just did. Now.
4084893 4086964 Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.
4088016 4089811 I'm a righty, I'm a righty. I'm a righty.
4089812 4091344 I need my other hand, I really do.
4093146 4094358 I'm a righty.
4127959 4129237 One last door to open.
4130976 4132357 Do you know what you're doing?
4132547 4135156 I mean, do you realize what<br />this will do to the country?
4135312 4136847 Yes, I do.
4137076 4138243 Now open the door.
4139234 4140167 Ok, good.
4140817 4142403 Glad we're on the same page.
4149245 4150175 You do?
4151354 4152559 I'm glad you know.
4167972 4168838 How you doing?
4178942 4179926 Hang on.
4255032 4256823 Listen, let's just talk about this<br />for one second.
4261567 4263916 How you doing?<br />That's not too tight, is it?
4267544 4268407 Damn it.
4271535 4272813 Smile pretty.
4307364 4308303 McClane!
4310784 4311666 Shit.
4313086 4314447 McClane, get out of there.
4316660 4318052 Come on, man. Come on.
4322629 4323618 Come on, man.
4345282 4346356 Did you see that?
4351074 4352188 So you stopped it, right?
4352197 4352979 Yeah, yeah.
4352980 4354853 You know actually,<br />having a gun makes it
4354854 4356468 harder to do this kind of work.
4356470 4357118 What?
4357120 4358697 I know that comes as a surprise.
4362919 4364020 You can't just turn it off?
4364661 4366109 Lock them out?<br />I'm not sure.
4368488 4371576 I might be able to slow them down, though.
4373306 4374929 Western and Central hubs are ours.
4374930 4376236 We're just waiting on Mai's end.
4377685 4379020 Hang on. Something's up.
4379561 4381253 All the security's reactivating.
4382565 4386430 I think someone might be in the market<br />for some cheap Viagra.
4386432 4387481 Some of that?
4387546 4389459 Now that your girlfriend is dead,<br />why don't you...
4389609 4392398 check out our sexy singles<br />that you can chat with?
4393242 4394485 It's an e-bomb.
4407298 4408470 Alright, alright, wait, wait, wait.
4412422 4413955 <i>Mai, talk to me.<br />What's going on?</i>
4413956 4414966 Mai?
4416098 4417153 Yeah.
4417375 4419524 Little Asian chick, likes to kick people?
4419937 4422895 I don't think she's gonna be talking<br />to anybody for a really long time.
4424190 4425141 <i>Last time I saw her,</i>
4425143 4429034 she was at the bottom of an<br />elevator shaft with an SUV up her ass.
4430357 4431354 <i>What's the matter?</i>
4431548 4432805 <i>Cat got your tongue?</i>
4433616 4434781 Listen, jackass.
4435629 4437030 Your fire sale is over.
4438794 4440408 Just pack up your little circus
4440633 4443132 or I'm gonna come and<br />I'm gonna kick your ass.
4443381 4445777 You have no idea,
4446185 4449308 who I am or what I'm capable of.
4449758 4452195 <i>When I'm finished here<br />and I promise it'll be soon.</i>
4452385 4453493 I will focus,
4453934 4454987 all my attention,
4455151 4456056 <i>on you.</i>
4457514 4458909 You wanna make things personal,
4459261 4460032 <i>fine.</i>
4480349 4483765 Reroute every cubic foot of natural gas<br />in the pipelines to that station.
4486361 4487787 Can you get Bowman on this thing?
4488254 4490239 Sure. I can get anyone on it.
4491216 4492030 Do it.
4492201 4494001 Now?<br />Yeah, now.
4497973 4498959 Please, no.
4500751 4501899 It's Thomas Gabriel.
4501900 4502712 Shit.
4504799 4505999 <i>You know this guy?</i>
4506435 4507594 I worked with him.
4507899 4511251 He was DOD's chief programmer<br />for infrastructure security.
4511529 4514057 After 9/11, he's the guy<br />that told Joint Chiefs,
4514266 4515575 the system was vulnerable.
4515577 4516999 He wanted an overhaul,
4517000 4518083 but they would not listen.
4518084 4519869 Gabriel's not people-friendly.
4519871 4520811 You think so?
4521581 4522893 <i>When he tried to go public,</i>
4522894 4524192 they crucified him.
4524602 4527626 Destroyed his reputation, froze assets.
4527705 4528892 After that he disappeared.
4529039 4531181 We got a pretty serious problem.
4531674 4532952 Hold on one minute.
4532953 4533645 What?
4533692 4536385 I think we need to get out<br />of here right now.
4537782 4539448 They're sending the gas lines here.
4539449 4540964 Gas lines? What gas lines?
4541574 4542458 Christ.
4544562 4545814 All of them.
4545815 4548448 See that, those flashing arrows?<br />That's not good.
4548524 4549696 All that's coming here?
4550196 4551993 Yeah. I think we got to go.
4552712 4554143 <i>Listen, I got to go.<br />I got to go, just</i>
4554144 4555441 find Thomas Gabriel.
4555782 4556553 McClane?
4557178 4557939 McClane?
4558221 4559588 Let's go. Finish this up.
4566209 4568593 Right now. Finish it up,<br />come on. Let's go.
4588656 4589697 Get in there.
4636123 4637017 You ok?
4642660 4643560 Let's go. Come on.
4643978 4644798 We got to get outta here.
4644800 4646872 What is the point?<br />Man, what is the point?
4646874 4647430 Hey.
4647791 4648999 Knock that off, come on.
4649233 4651102 This has something to do with<br />that code you wrote for them, right?
4651104 4652061 Now think.
4652062 4653333 Come on, help us win.
4654942 4655655 Win?
4656213 4657608 When do we start winning?
4658667 4659479 Take a look around.
4659480 4660892 Are you out of your mind?<br />Does it look...
4661155 4662835 like we're close to winning?
4663128 4665191 We just got the shit kicked out of us.
4665730 4667097 What, do you think<br />I'm holding out on you?
4667098 4667972 There is something<br />I'm just not telling you?
4667973 4670078 If I knew what they wanted,<br />I would tell you.
4670080 4671644 I would happily tell you.
4672616 4673618 Jesus.
4710772 4711528 The Warlock.
4712214 4713150 The Warlock.
4714263 4715232 Great.
4715799 4716858 There goes the cellphone.
4716860 4718386 They knocked satellites<br />out of the skies?
4718585 4720221 No, your battery ran out.
4720223 4721348 Listen, we should go see him.
4721778 4722445 Who?
4722576 4723884 The Warlock,<br />we should drive to his house.
4723885 4725301 He's not that far away.<br />He's in Baltimore.
4725303 4726981 Can't go to the Warlock's house now.<br />Hey?
4726982 4729249 Hey, hey, you want me to help you.
4729332 4730600 Ok? Trust me.
4730601 4731913 We got to go see the Warlock.
4731914 4733085 That's our only hope.
4739051 4740302 How do you feel about flying?
4740820 4743097 About what?<br />You mean like with a pilot?
4750646 4752088 Just stick it in the round thing.
4752089 4753399 What brown thing?
4753482 4754824 Here, put these on.
4756265 4758329 Just stick it in there. That'll work.
4759030 4759853 You ok?
4761141 4763034 Yeah, I'm just kind of afraid of flying.
4763117 4765167 Yeah, I used to be terrified of flying.
4765168 4766112 Really?<br />Yeah.
4766113 4768785 I took some lessons. You know,<br />face your fears, that kind of thing.
4768807 4770928 Yeah? Did it help?<br />Not really.
4772494 4773205 Is it.
4776920 4778199 Is it supposed to make that sound?
4778512 4779331 Yeah.
4781519 4782647 Maybe we should just drive.
4782649 4783876 It'll be fun, it'll be like a road trip.
4783878 4786275 Just take it easy.<br />They say taking off is the hardest part.
4786277 4787432 Really? I heard...
4787850 4789935 To be honest, I missed a couple of classes.
4790763 4792058 You did? Really?
4792289 4793588 But you have your licence, right?
4793589 4796859 I mean, you can fly one of these things?
4796943 4798655 Oh, hey! Here we go.
4799410 4800153 We're up.
4800613 4801673 Oh, God.
4806684 4807937 That's good. That's pretty good.
4810840 4811983 Jesus, look at that.
4812327 4813657 This whole area is blacked out.
4816044 4817873 How we gonna find Warlock's house?
4819121 4821760 It's probably gonna be<br />the one with the lights still on.
4829567 4832875 Power outage keeps spreading. About half<br />the East Coast has already gone down.
4834854 4835662 Alright.
4835918 4837801 Put everything on<br />emergency generators.
4838565 4840030 How the hell are they getting past us?
4844866 4846933 Ok. Down there, down there. I see it.
4847077 4848200 Down there?<br />Left. Down.
4853464 4855423 We're gonna land there?<br />We're gonna land down there?
4857462 4858948 Alright, hang on.<br />Ok, Ok.
4863390 4864428 Fence. Fence.
4866527 4867979 Fence. Fence!
4867980 4868654 I see it.
4869075 4869611 Watch!
4883076 4884574 Jesus.<br />Come on.
4884809 4887490 Oh yeah, oh yeah,<br />taking off is the hardest part.
4888202 4888992 Let's go.
4892159 4894491 Now, there is something you<br />need to know about Warlock.
4894492 4895807 He, he hates cops.
4896097 4897680 I mean, he hates them, ok so...
4897829 4899416 just let me do all the talking.
4909087 4910026 Shit.
4911300 4912754 Hey, Mrs Kaludis.
4914045 4915147 Is Freddy home?
4917440 4919245 I'm Matt Farrell and this is...
4920568 4921430 Billy.
4923016 4925276 We're friends from Space Camp.
4925277 4927001 I went to Space Camp with Freddy.
4928727 4929891 Freddy!
4930912 4931899 Freddy?
4931900 4933309 You got company.
4939881 4940799 Frederick.
4941113 4942371 Didn't you hear me?
4943057 4944932 All Baltimore heard you, Ma.
4945082 4946339 Your friends are here.
4946589 4948131 Friends? What the?
4949264 4950010 Come on, Ma!
4950011 4953281 How many times I got to tell you,<br />don't bring people down here, man!
4953337 4955884 I can't see too good.<br />Is that a young bearded Han Solo?
4955905 4957961 What happened, man?<br />You lost so much weight.
4957963 4959399 No dude, I gained 30 pounds.<br />Know what?
4959401 4960352 Who is that?
4960354 4961488 Oh, that's?<br />You know what doesn't matter.
4961490 4962964 Dude, what are you doing here?
4962965 4966336 Because of you, I am rocking<br />five generators just so I can stay online.
4966532 4968637 And since you're being<br />hunted by assassins,
4968639 4971486 it doesn't really make me think,<br />like this visit is a very productive
4971487 4972996 or healthy use of my time and...
4972997 4974868 Hey, hey, hey, hey, don't,<br />don't touch that, alright?
4975686 4976883 CB radio?
4978038 4979730 A little low-tech for you guys, isn't it?
4979732 4981158 Low-tech-dude, that my friend,
4981159 4983391 is an end-of-the-world<br />insurance system, ok?
4983438 4984985 So when the last microchip goes down,
4984987 4986766 I'm gonna be able to stay in touch<br />with whoever's out there,
4986906 4988622 whether they be zombies or not.
4988624 4989426 I'll tell you that right now.
4989595 4991320 What'd you bring your dad here for?
4991321 4993654 He's cool. He's into<br />the whole gaming culture...
4993656 4994404 Nice poster?
4996687 4998235 Oh well like you a big fan of the Fett?
4998873 4999518 No.
4999925 5001555 I was always more of a Star Wars guy.
5002491 5004027 Oh, he's kidding.<br />Star Wars guy?
5004028 5005693 Who is this man?<br />He's my...
5006156 5007906 Dump truck. I'm not his dad.
5008490 5009582 I'm a cop. How about that?
5010357 5012265 Oh, a cop, I'm sorry.<br />Thank you very much.
5012267 5014797 Why'd you bring a cop<br />into my command centre?
5015913 5017126 Command centre.
5017127 5018110 It's a basement.
5018112 5020587 It's a command centre.<br />Don't help McClane! I can explain.
5020589 5022747 Just tell us what you know<br />about Thomas Gabriel, alright?
5022749 5023999 That's why we came here.
5024561 5026819 Thomas Gabriel. That's cool.<br />I didn't know. I'm sorry.
5026821 5029124 Get out. I want you outta here, right now.
5029126 5030852 Hey! Calm down.
5030853 5032594 Just calm down, big boy.<br />You calm down!
5032596 5033915 It's my house.
5034989 5036475 You're gonna tell me<br />what I wanna know,
5036476 5038212 or I'll beat you to death<br />in your own house.
5054120 5055196 Four years ago,
5055197 5058463 D.O.D. recruits Thomas Gabriel<br />to be a cyberspook for them, ok?
5058549 5060561 First day on the job,<br />goes in to his bosses
5060563 5062979 and tells them this nation's security<br />infrastructure
5063158 5065451 is wide open to compromise,<br />and what do they say?
5065535 5066749 We'll take it under advisement.
5066750 5069315 But this dude don't ease up because<br />he's committed like you read about,
5069533 5072826 so he breaks into a meeting<br />of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, ok?
5072834 5074382 And using just a laptop,
5074383 5077609 hacks into NORAD and shuts down<br />our entire defense network,
5077688 5079360 till they put a gun to the man's head
5079361 5081024 and forced him to stop the hack.
5081179 5084377 Thomas Gabriel's the guy who<br />shut down NORAD with a laptop,
5084534 5085577 just to prove a point.
5085579 5086684 You think I'm scared of you?
5086686 5088305 Just tell us how to find the guy,
5088306 5089361 that's all.<br />How do I know how to find the guy?
5089362 5091658 He's a ghost man.<br />He just fell off the grid.
5091741 5093034 Another dead end. Come on.
5093035 5093952 Hold on, wait, McClane.
5094035 5095023 Listen Warlock,
5095960 5097861 A couple of weeks ago I wrote a...<br />I know, dude,
5097863 5100153 you wrote a mutating mutating<br />algorithmic security code,
5100154 5102251 that's probably being used<br />by Thomas Gabriel now.
5103254 5104830 No, we know that. Yes.
5105071 5106477 Can you tell us<br />what he's using it for?
5106479 5108725 I don't know. I've been trying<br />to figure that out. Here, look.
5110553 5112511 The only security<br />system in the country
5112670 5115767 that I can find currently<br />employing that particular template
5115769 5117851 is the Social Security Administration, ok?
5117871 5120185 But they don't use it<br />in the main facility. Look.
5120560 5121776 They use it in this building,
5122361 5123561 Over here in Woodlawn.
5123816 5125927 What the hell? God.
5125928 5126944 I know, right?
5127028 5128028 Right, what?
5128029 5129203 What the hell are you<br />guys talking about?
5129351 5131203 The power consumption is off the charts.<br />It's hot.
5131238 5133112 It's hot. It's on fire.<br />Why would there be chilling towers there?
5133114 5133951 That's what I thought.
5134462 5135295 Hello.
5136078 5137335 What's a chilling tower?
5138500 5140303 See what I've been dealing with?
5140541 5143680 Large server farms generate a lot<br />of heat and need to be cooled.
5144837 5146093 But why there?
5146094 5147011 Tell you what, guys.
5147012 5148108 I don't know what's in that building,
5148110 5149777 but I assure you it's not<br />Social Security numbers.
5156682 5157933 I got a red flag over here.
5158723 5160281 Someone's hacking into Woodlawn.
5162532 5164232 Honing in on the host server right now.
5166609 5168113 Frederick Kaludis.
5168657 5170754 Let's have a look at him.<br />Fat bastard.
5176406 5177342 McClane.
5177671 5178929 Where is his daughter?
5179231 5180798 We just got a trace on her cell.
5182000 5183585 You're going to love this.
5187721 5189450 Alright. Let's get a better look at you.
5202103 5203132 Freddy?
5203133 5203880 <i>What?</i>
5204290 5206955 <i>What the hell are you doing<br />dicking around inside my network?</i>
5212280 5213156 <i>McClane?</i>
5214095 5215381 I thought I killed you already?
5216246 5217478 I get that sometimes.
5221360 5222219 You think you can...
5223029 5225085 find a track where he is?<br />Dude, yeah.
5225087 5225993 <i>Detective,</i>
5226170 5227667 <i>covering the camera with your hand,</i>
5227930 5229933 does not turn off<br />the microphone.
5231273 5232137 Yeah,
5233158 5236206 I know I'm not as smart as you<br />guys with all this computer shit,
5237647 5238384 but hey,
5239737 5241318 <i>I'm still alive, ain't I?</i>
5242099 5242842 <i>I mean you,</i>
5242843 5245480 got to be running<br />out of bad guys by now, right?
5250309 5251238 Gabriel?
5254115 5255563 Honestly, you can tell me.
5255953 5256924 I mean, how does that work?
5257159 5258996 You got some kind of service or something?<br />Some kind of...
5259593 5261948 800 number?<br />1-800-HENCHMEN?
5262293 5264670 You know what?<br />I bet you're still on hold with.
5264753 5268028 Can I get another dead Asian hooker<br />bitch over here right away?
5270474 5271522 But seriously,
5271523 5272811 all that kicking aside,
5272812 5274392 that skinny little ninja chick,
5274393 5275886 <i>she was smoking hot.</i>
5276638 5279053 A new one of those gonna be<br />real hard to come by, right?
5279820 5281840 You're very impressed with yourself,<br />aren't you?
5282061 5283178 I have my moments.
5283951 5284646 Yeah?
5287440 5288581 Is this one of them?
5293737 5296221 <i>Hello?</i><br />Yes, this is emergency services calling.
5297154 5298640 <i>Thank God.</i><br />Can she hear me?
5298642 5300739 <i>My name is Lucy Gennero.<br />I've been stuck for hours.</i>
5300743 5301556 <i>I've been trying to call...</i><br />Hey?
5301946 5303305 <i>My cell's not working.</i><br />Can she hear this?
5303500 5304777 Lucy, hang up that phone.
5305212 5306654 <i>Yes, calm down, miss.</i>
5307031 5309268 <i>We know exactly where you are.</i>
5309562 5311238 <i>Everything is gonna be alright.</i>
5311263 5312492 Lucy, hang up the phone.
5313139 5314032 <i>Please John.</i>
5314206 5316252 I'm trying to have a conversation.
5318850 5321988 <i>We're a bit overloaded tonight,<br />as you may imagine,</i>
5322031 5323245 <i>but I assure you,</i>
5323246 5324577 <i>we're gonna get you out of there.</i>
5324598 5327722 Even if I have to come down there<br />and get you myself.
5328164 5328936 <i>Thank you.</i>
5329191 5330768 In the meantime Miss Gennero,<br />is there anyone
5330769 5332645 <i>you would like us to contact for you?</i>
5332806 5333590 <i>Yeah.</i>
5335246 5335981 My dad.
5337700 5339028 His name is John McClane.
5339741 5341075 <i>He's a New York City cop.</i>
5342001 5342810 <i>We'll find him.</i>
5343310 5344647 <i>Just hang in there miss,</i>
5345050 5346103 <i>and we'll get to you,</i>
5346659 5347589 <i>very soon.</i>
5349807 5350810 <i>Thank you.</i>
5352859 5353586 <i>Well.</i>
5354429 5357761 <i>That's a great girl you got there.</i><br />Can't wait to meet her.
5358126 5360136 <i>What's the matter?<br />Cat got your tongue?</i>
5361050 5362574 Come on, John.
5364075 5365121 Make a joke.
5366710 5368110 Say something funny.
5375732 5377404 Where you go...<br />Where you going
5378364 5379859 Hey! McClane!
5379860 5380766 Hold on. Hold on.
5381116 5382934 Where you going.<br />What are you gonna do?
5383141 5384373 What do you think I'm gonna do?
5385291 5387508 I'm gonna go kill this<br />guy and get my daughter.
5387625 5388870 But she can be anywhere...<br />No, hey, listen.
5389670 5391712 It's gonna get messy.<br />You just stay here.
5391714 5393098 I think I...<br />Hey. Hey.
5393738 5394969 I'm doing you a favour.
5395191 5396533 I would not bet on me, alright?
5397803 5399067 I'll take it from here.
5399883 5400949 Thanks for your help.
5409003 5411735 I would not bet on you either,<br />so I figured I'd lend a hand.
5414863 5416008 Buckle up.
5442904 5444798 FBI, ma'am. Jersey field office.
5445282 5446653 Mind if I see your ID?
5447218 5448117 Not at all.
5458363 5459481 My dad's a cop.
5459943 5461000 Force of habit.
5461658 5463663 Your father sounds like<br />a very smart man.
5469434 5470989 Kid, can you get Bowman?
5472065 5472810 Yeah.
5483723 5484941 It's completely dead.
5485667 5488660 Gabriel must have shut down<br />all the satellite links. Shit.
5494535 5496046 I'm sorry about Lucy, man.
5499739 5500946 About all of it.
5502074 5504521 It was my fault you got into this.<br />This wasn't your fight.
5504994 5506516 You got nothing to be sorry about.
5511575 5512894 Let go of me, you bastard.
5513097 5514744 This bitch is a handful.
5520441 5521900 Are you gonna be alright?
5525066 5527491 Hey. Behave or I will hurt you.
5527892 5528643 Yeah?
5529244 5530636 Let's step outside, just you and me.
5531628 5533118 We'll see who hurts who.
5534606 5536157 You really are his daughter.
5537166 5538156 Tie her wrists.
5545971 5546712 Trey,
5546827 5547983 Gabriel wants to see you.
5548459 5549529 Is it that time already?
5549530 5550121 Yeah.
5551837 5552614 Ok.
5554390 5556422 I'll be back in a second.
5562302 5563223 No, no, no, please.
5609239 5611371 We're showing a breach<br />on an exterior vent.
5616382 5617485 Go take a look.
5619484 5620919 Don't be long.<br />We're packing up soon.
5633159 5634432 Hey, McClane.
5634895 5636689 Do we have anything<br />resembling a plan or anything?
5637350 5639213 Find Lucy and kill everybody else.
5639227 5641573 No, I mean more like a plan.<br />Like, a way to do that.
5645167 5645958 Come on.
5648220 5649660 Ok, according to the layout,
5649702 5651757 the chilling towers are<br />kept on the bottom level.
5658947 5659961 I think mine is locked.
5664804 5666738 Ok. Now it looks like<br />we're getting somewhere.
5679530 5682120 Ok, this looks like it controls the<br />cooling system for the mainframe,
5682128 5684226 which should be...
5685947 5687226 If I can just hack in,
5689722 5691873 trip the alarm, it might alert Bowman.
5701026 5702242 Someone set off the alarms.
5702738 5704173 Yes. Thank you, detective.
5704174 5706167 I can hear that.<br />Find a way to turn it off.
5710976 5711989 What have you got?
5714164 5715083 We got a problem.
5715224 5717033 The alarms went off at Woodlawn.
5718945 5719953 It's got to be him.
5720947 5722600 And what's Woodlawn?
5727201 5728285 It's N.S.A.
5728727 5731288 A secure facility outside of Baltimore.
5731380 5735814 It's a fail-safe we built after 9/11<br />to back up all financial information.
5736257 5737751 The moment networks were hit,
5737752 5741262 all financial data automatically<br />began downloading to those servers.
5741384 5742827 Banks, Wall Street,
5743063 5744200 corporate records,
5744201 5745571 government funds,
5745572 5746473 all of it.
5746603 5749766 Basically, a backup for<br />the accumulated wealth of America.
5750618 5751933 All in one location?
5754163 5755330 What could Gabriel do with it?
5755453 5757088 Well, if he could get in, he might try,
5757231 5759642 transfer the data to a portable hard drive.
5759960 5762234 Then he'd have access to<br />those accounts from anywhere.
5762575 5764055 Siphon off billions for himself.
5765925 5767207 We've no ways to trace it.
5767594 5768757 Or knowing him,
5769078 5772125 he could erase it all and send<br />us all back to the Stone Age.
5773545 5775294 Why the hell wasn't I told about this?
5775801 5777088 Frankly...
5777493 5778727 it's above your pay grade.
5779064 5780272 My pay grade?
5783367 5786828 How the hell did Gabriel find out about this<br />when even I didn't know about it?
5790968 5792069 He designed it.
5794655 5796094 It was his program.
5796477 5800127 He knew that hacking your system<br />last night would trigger the download.
5801966 5803049 That's brilliant.
5803502 5805022 You two geniuses,
5805570 5806924 stay out of my way.
5812973 5815234 Let me see if I can get a floor plan<br />of this place.
5817089 5817867 Don't move.
5819312 5820979 You, get away from the bag.
5820980 5821856 Now.
5821940 5822892 Ok, Ok.
5823486 5824843 We've been waiting for you.
5826653 5827407 Yeah?
5828636 5830077 I've been waiting for you, too.
5857030 5858173 McClane!
5860521 5861574 McClane!
5864650 5865427 Kid?
5866444 5867240 Matt?
5867653 5868560 Kid.
5882168 5883179 <i>Emerson.</i>
5885176 5887654 We seem to have a problem<br />in one of the cooling towers.
5887656 5888948 Tower seven.<br />Tower seven.
5888950 5890184 <i>Find out what's going on.</i>
5890481 5891688 Copy that. Ok.
5901011 5901746 Sir?
5901938 5903384 Get the HR team to stand by.
5903385 5904649 We need to get to Woodlawn now.
5904732 5907427 The roads out are completely blocked.<br />DC's in total gridlock.
5907610 5909094 Then get us some helicopters.
5909528 5912033 Sir they were all pulled by the Pentagon<br />for search and rescue.
5912346 5915044 Molina, find me some goddamn<br />helicopters immediately.
5916907 5917732 Look,
5917910 5919993 the Pentagon has jets<br />flying CAP over D.C.
5920162 5923095 Have them send one to Woodlawn and<br />keep an eye on things till we get there.
5923168 5923801 Let's go.
5936515 5937818 Where's my daughter?
5938512 5939687 <i>Russo, check in.</i>
5943824 5947594 <i>Yeah, I think Russo's on his way down<br />to meet your girlfriend, dickhead.</i>
5949278 5950346 <i>Hold on a minute.</i>
5950787 5952062 Looks like he's coming around.
5952990 5954891 It's McClane. He's on the third floor.<br />The kid...
5959303 5960464 <i>Get all that?</i>
5961058 5962130 <i>That's right.</i>
5962833 5964147 I'm on the third floor.
5964608 5966109 But I'm coming to get you.
5974970 5975966 Don't move now.
5976295 5977415 I'll send a doctor.
5980642 5982891 Kill this guy and I'll give you Mai's cut.
5984919 5985833 See you.
6029567 6030876 My algorithm.
6036906 6038238 Ok, please get in.
6040331 6041301 God. Please.
6078985 6080759 Jesus, they're going after the money.
6104685 6106240 <i>You coming to get me, John?</i>
6106241 6107605 <i>Is that the plan?</i>
6107688 6109579 Yep, that's my plan.
6109982 6111566 What makes you think<br />I won't put a bullet
6111567 6112980 in your daughter's head right now?
6113139 6114423 Because you're scared of me.
6114595 6116605 Is that right?<br />You think I'm afraid of you?
6117448 6119272 Otherwise she'd be dead already.
6119273 6120743 <i>You need a bargaining chip.</i>
6127708 6128600 Stop there.
6128986 6129948 Hands up.
6130387 6132092 If you kill me, you'll never get it open.
6135796 6136986 Move away.
6136987 6137955 Move!
6145311 6146214 You know, John,
6146215 6148648 I feel like we've gotten off<br />on the wrong foot.
6149400 6150579 And because of that,
6150580 6152706 <i>you think I'm the bad guy.</i>
6153124 6154598 Nothing could be<br />further from the truth.
6154599 6155919 I'm the good guy here.
6156112 6157481 I told them,
6157482 6159536 this could happen if they didn't prepare.
6159606 6161769 Did I get a thank-you?<br />No, I got crucified.
6161770 6163286 <i>But they would not listen.</i>
6163288 6164896 You got their attention now, don't you?
6165273 6166109 That's right.
6167290 6170072 I am doing the country a favour.
6170729 6171962 <i>By tearing it apart.</i>
6171982 6173020 Better me than some...
6173021 6174097 outsider.
6174667 6177112 Some religious nut-job<br />bent on Armageddon.
6177259 6178573 Nobody wants to see that happen.
6179291 6181357 Everything I've broken,
6181358 6182414 can be fixed.
6183472 6186186 If the country is willing to pay for it.
6186702 6187620 <i>Bullshit.</i>
6187621 6189134 It's always been about the money.
6189580 6191206 What?<br />I should not get paid for my work?
6192024 6193793 I'm working my ass off here, John.
6193948 6195314 Well, just sit tight, asshole.
6195315 6196611 I got a cheque for you.
6200616 6201866 I can't talk to this guy.
6201871 6203855 You talk to him, see if<br />you can get him to focus.
6205662 6206486 Dad?
6209520 6210360 <i>Hi, baby.</i>
6211555 6213222 Now there are only five of them.
6216674 6217828 Hang on, Lucy.
6217829 6219029 I'm coming
6229478 6231838 Would somebody<br />please kill this son of a bitch?
6234609 6235753 We have a problem.
6237106 6238161 No, there is...
6238317 6239229 There's actually no problem.
6239231 6240840 I think I just got off on the wrong floor.
6243880 6244798 This is a mess.
6248297 6250501 I'm...<br />I'm truly impressed, man.
6250502 6252168 Hacking every byte of financial data
6252170 6254778 for the entire country'd take weeks<br />unless you eliminated the congestion.
6256541 6258236 That's what this fire sale is about, isn't it?
6259763 6260813 That's brilliant.
6261022 6262888 Yes, it is. Please be quiet.
6263137 6264048 Asshole.
6264469 6265369 Who are you?
6266163 6267209 Matt Farrell.
6268510 6269717 Lucy McClane.
6271022 6272237 I thought your name was Gennero.
6273325 6274483 Lucy Gennero.
6274607 6275446 Not today.
6276429 6277525 Can you crack the code?
6278446 6280306 Maybe. I mean, if I had enough time.
6280569 6281890 That's encouraging.
6284286 6285457 Take them with us.
6286648 6287551 Let's go.
6287894 6288696 Let's go.
6290993 6293502 Gabriel, Pentagon just sent<br />an F-35 towards us.
6294378 6295480 Keep an eye on it.
6298285 6299872 Pulling down the go codes now.
6316707 6319426 You might want to start thinking about<br />what you want on your headstone, asshole.
6327028 6327595 Christ!
6328215 6329457 Goddamn hamster.
6330361 6331247 There you go.
6332082 6333285 Stay still, spider-boy.
6338250 6339138 That's right.
6369263 6370241 Goddammit!
6380423 6381591 Oh, no.
6383887 6385844 Seriously I probably<br />should not antagonise them,
6385845 6388149 since they have<br />all the loaded guns and what not.
6388384 6389811 Listen, will you just take a minute,
6389965 6391390 dig deep for a bigger set of balls,
6391391 6392764 because you're gonna need them<br />before we're through.
6393300 6394367 I know that tone.
6394456 6396919 It's just weird hearing it<br />come from someone with hair.
6434391 6435090 Sir.
6435761 6437401 ETA 15 minutes.
6462548 6465050 There we go.
6491944 6492837 Fix it.
6493764 6495734 Why? You're just<br />gonna kill me if I fix it.
6495735 6496660 I know that.
6504089 6505618 Oh, shit!
6509222 6510505 I'm not gonna do it.
6515301 6516571 No, no, no. Shit.
6516572 6518248 Robinson is coming pretty fast.
6519397 6520388 I'm sorry, what?
6520389 6521398 Something's wrong.
6521400 6522787 Robinson is coming too fast.
6528073 6528987 It's not Robinson.
6529944 6531324 That would be my dad.
6543228 6544082 <i>Freddy?</i>
6546281 6547008 <i>Freddy?</i>
6549177 6550475 <i>It's John McClane.</i>
6550812 6553173 Look, I know you can hear me.<br />This is your frequency, right?
6553627 6554461 666.
6554463 6555936 <i>Come on, pick up the mic, Freddy.</i>
6559949 6561955 <i>Nobody here by that name. Sorry.</i>
6562375 6563642 Hackerjerk-off.
6568482 6569278 Warlock...
6570532 6571705 I need you to do,
6572072 6574193 whatever it is you do<br />to patch me through,
6574559 6575694 to the FBI.
6576121 6577989 To Deputy Director Bowman.
6578057 6579111 <i>You hear me?</i>
6579449 6580541 Are you serious?
6580727 6583272 <i>You want me to intentionally<br />open up a com line</i>
6583274 6585784 <i>to the head of the FBI's cyber division?<br />I don't think so.</i>
6587633 6589593 Freddy, goddammit,<br />they have my daughter.
6595156 6596726 <i>I can do that. Hold on.</i>
6598978 6599697 Thank you.
6607236 6608194 This is Central.
6608195 6610076 <i>We have a patch<br />for Director Bowman.</i>
6611073 6611748 Sir.
6611998 6613397 Central's trying to reach you.
6615348 6616047 Go.
6616495 6617742 Bowman, it's McClane.
6617743 6618576 McClane.
6618719 6619537 Listen to me.
6619538 6622999 Gabriel is on the 695 headed<br />north in a Hazmat truck.
6623072 6624929 <i>Wait, Gabriel's left Woodlawn?</i>
6624930 6626222 <i>We're headed there right now.</i>
6626274 6627082 <i>Bowman.</i>
6627746 6628951 He's got my daughter.
6630681 6632351 <i>Listen, this Hazmat truck</i>
6632659 6635084 is a government vehicle,<br />so it should be LoJacked, right?
6635640 6637630 Track that down, it should take you to him.
6637824 6638887 Give me the tag number.
6639062 6639979 Alright. Hang on.
6639980 6640892 Here it comes.

6649296 6649896 Got it.
6650251 6651924 McClane, where is Farrell?
6652156 6653197 He's with them.
6654576 6655633 <i>Listen to me.</i>
6656161 6658018 I'm gonna go in<br />there and get Lucy out,
6658926 6660181 but if something happens to me,
6660707 6662647 <i>you got to send<br />the cavalry in, you hear me?</i>
6663175 6664402 I mean everybody.
6665118 6667492 <i>Don't let that maniac get my daughter,<br />you hear me?</i>
6667589 6668909 John, don't worry.
6668910 6670396 I want your word, Bowman.
6673149 6674218 Yeah, you have it.
6675806 6676687 McClane out.
6684757 6685925 There's the F-35.

6690898 6691798 Trey.<br />Yes.
6691799 6693571 Did you get the go codes?<br />Yes. I got the go codes.
6693573 6695146 Can you connect me to the pilot?

6772724 6774601 You're shooting at the wrong guy.
6782718 6784456 I don't think Daddy's coming, honey.
6797332 6798152 Hey!
6798669 6799544 Jackass!
6847547 6848709 Is that it?

7039705 7041560 You have one.
7042109 7043194 The rules haven't changed, man.
7043196 7045015 You're gonna kill me<br />the minute I unlock it.
7049926 7051933 Oh, shit. Oh, shit.<br />Matthew?
7052041 7053146 Matthew.
7053563 7055261 I really need you to pay attention.
7056373 7059055 The rules can always change.
7059056 7059841 Ok, wait.
7060132 7062510 I'm gonna shoot her in ten seconds.<br />Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait.

7161176 7162128 You got her?
7163509 7164425 You're sure?
7167630 7168665 Nice effort, though.
7169710 7170523 Matthew.
7170524 7171793 Oh, shit.
7171794 7172798 Alright, ok!
7172928 7174497 Ok. I'm doing it. I know.
7182552 7183493 McClane.
7184856 7186232 Would you do me a favour?
7189111 7191188 I know the lights are beginning to dim,
7191370 7193880 but if you could just hang on<br />for a second,
7193938 7195250 as soon as Matt's finished,
7195251 7197268 I'm gonna kill him and your daughter,
7197373 7199862 and I would love for you to see that.
7201766 7203399 Goddammit. Matthew?
7204372 7205289 Ten seconds, ok?
7205290 7206744 Ten seconds.<br />You'll have all your money.
7206880 7208777 You just leave.<br />No one has to get hurt, ok?
7209095 7210756 A few seconds.<br />Stay with me.
7211074 7211984 McClane.
7214386 7216334 Stay with me.<br />Dad?
7217467 7218653 On your tombstone,
7218831 7221234 it should read,<br />Always in the wrong place,
7221554 7222823 at the wrong time.
7223505 7224502 How about,
7224896 7227055 Yippee-ki-yay, motherf...
7241230 7243418 Daddy. Daddy. Daddy.
7244025 7244859 Are you ok?
7245200 7246925 Yes, baby, I'm fine.
7249105 7250648 I knew you'd come for me.
7250865 7252604 Of course I'd come for you, honey.
7252913 7255372 Sorry it took me so long.<br />It's ok.
7263367 7264578 Move, move.
7269980 7270964 Freeze!
7271886 7272722 Hold, hold.
7273348 7274305 He's ok.
7276766 7278939 Get that vehicle.<br />Come around.
7279325 7281170 Here, help Daddy up.
7281171 7281905 Ok.
7282945 7285529 Wait. I think I'll just stay here for a minute.
7286526 7287881 Ok. Daddy,
7288310 7289360 You're outta your mind.
7289534 7290592 What are you talking about?
7290594 7291655 You shot yourself.
7292300 7294067 It seemed like a good idea at the time.
7295534 7297316 Don't tell these guys that I did that.
7309906 7311213 Thanks for all your help, John.
7311807 7312720 Thank you.
7314770 7315827 Is he ok?
7317759 7319946 Should I put my hands up?<br />No, don't put your hands up.
7320811 7321879 Put them down further?
7323030 7325045 He might die of shock<br />on the way to the hospital.
7329898 7330848 Alright.
7333673 7335037 I'll be right back.
7337180 7338801 Hey.<br />Hey.
7339455 7340777 How's it feel to be shot?
7340778 7342082 It actually feels great.
7342550 7343907 He gave me some...<br />What's it called?
7343908 7345172 Morphine.<br />Morphine.
7345887 7347963 Well, you got your merit badge now.
7348164 7349973 Yeah. I don't know what that means.
7351582 7353574 Plus you know, chicks dig scars.
7353575 7354543 Really?
7357119 7358351 Not that one.
7359400 7360854 What?<br />Don't even think about it.
7360856 7361986 How did you know<br />what I was thinking?
7362767 7364479 Did she say something to you?
7364894 7366954 I felt like we had kind of a vibe.
7367194 7369178 Take it easy. That's just<br />the morphine kicking in.
7369548 7370280 Yeah.
7371081 7371965 Besides,
7372538 7373955 after all we've been through,
7374608 7376170 I'd hate to have to beat you to death.
7377865 7378969 That would suck.
7381617 7383149 Good to go?<br />Yeah, all set.
7383591 7384855 Take care of yourself.
7384856 7386390 I'll see you at the hospital.
7390858 7391811 Hey?
7393935 7395472 Thanks for saving my daughter's life.
7395992 7396742 Ok.
7398221 7399578 What was I gonna do?
7402277 7403722 That's what makes you that guy.
7407449 7408218 Yeah.
7414879 7415879 So...
7416073 7417599 did he say anything about me?
7420003 7421896 Jesus, Lucy.
7422028 7424035 What? I'm sorry. I'm just asking.
7425842 7427322 I'm in enough pain already.
7428206 7428984 Hospital.
